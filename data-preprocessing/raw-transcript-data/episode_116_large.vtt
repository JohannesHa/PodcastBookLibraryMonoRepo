00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
 The following is a conversation with Sarah Seager, a planetary scientist at MIT known

00:06.320 --> 00:12.120
 for her work on the search for exoplanets, which are planets outside of our solar system.

00:12.120 --> 00:18.440
 She's an author of two books on this fascinating topic, plus in a couple days, August 18th,

00:18.440 --> 00:23.680
 her new book, a memoir called The Smallest Lights in the Universe, is coming out.

00:23.680 --> 00:29.720
 I read it and I can recommend it highly, especially if you love space and are a bit of a romantic

00:29.720 --> 00:30.720
 like me.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.400
 It's beautifully written.

00:32.400 --> 00:36.860
 She weaves the stories of the tragedies and the triumphs of her life with the stories

00:36.860 --> 00:43.440
 of her love for and research on exoplanets, which represent our hope to find life out

00:43.440 --> 00:45.440
 there in the universe.

00:45.440 --> 00:46.760
 Quick summary of the ads.

00:46.760 --> 00:52.640
 Three sponsors, Public Goods, that's a new one, PowerDot, and Cash App.

 It really is the best way to support this podcast.

00:58.920 --> 00:59.920
 Just a quick side note.

00:59.920 --> 01:06.640
 Let me say that extraterrestrial life, aliens, I think represent our civilization longing

01:06.640 --> 01:12.320
 to make contact with the unknown, with others like us, or maybe others that are very different

01:12.320 --> 01:18.860
 from us, entities that might reveal something profound about why we're here.

01:18.860 --> 01:25.080
 The possibility of this is both exciting and, at least to me, terrifying, which is exactly

01:25.080 --> 01:28.480
 where we humans do our best work.

01:37.360 --> 01:41.000
 As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now, and never any ads in the middle that could

01:41.000 --> 01:43.040
 break the flow of the conversation.

01:43.040 --> 01:47.400
 I try to make these ad reads interesting if you do listen, but if you like, I give you

01:47.400 --> 01:53.080

 This show is sponsored by Public Goods, the one stop shop for affordable, sustainable,

02:04.800 --> 02:06.840
 healthy household products.

02:06.840 --> 02:11.160
 Their products have a minimalist black and white design that I find to be just clean,

02:11.160 --> 02:13.160
 elegant, and beautiful.

02:13.160 --> 02:16.360
 It's a style that makes me feel like I'm living in the future.

02:16.360 --> 02:21.440
 I imagine we'll all be using Public Goods products once we colonize Mars.

02:21.440 --> 02:27.300
 They got all the basics you need from healthy snacks like almonds to my favorite, the bamboo

02:27.300 --> 02:33.520
 toothbrush, and other stuff for personal care, home essentials, healthy food, and vitamins

02:33.520 --> 02:34.520
 and supplements.

02:34.520 --> 02:39.060
 I take their fish oil, for example, which I recommend highly for everyone.

02:39.060 --> 02:44.800
 They use a membership model to keep costs low and pass on the savings to us, the people.

02:44.800 --> 02:50.920
 They plant one tree for every order placed and have planted over 100,000 trees since

02:50.920 --> 02:53.160
 September 2019.

03:10.280 --> 03:15.960
 It's an Eastim electrical stimulation device that I've been using a lot for muscle recovery,

03:15.960 --> 03:20.880
 mostly for my shoulders and legs as I've been doing the crazy amounts of body weight reps

03:20.880 --> 03:24.200
 and 6 miles every other day now after the challenge.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.540
 Yes, I'm still doing it.

03:26.540 --> 03:31.980
 They call it the smart muscle stimulator since the app that goes with it is amazing.

03:31.980 --> 03:35.360
 It has 15 programs for different body parts and guides you through everything you need

03:35.360 --> 03:36.360
 to do.

03:36.360 --> 03:41.380
 I take recovery really seriously these days and Power Dot has been a powerful addition

03:41.380 --> 03:45.960
 to stretching, ice, massage, and sleep and diet.

03:45.960 --> 03:51.120
 It's used by professional athletes and by slightly insane, but mostly normal people

03:51.120 --> 03:52.280
 like me.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.560

 This show is presented by a sponsor that arguably made this whole podcast even possible.

04:14.400 --> 04:19.200
 Our first sponsor, the great, the powerful Cash App, the number one finance app in the

04:19.200 --> 04:20.200
 App Store.

04:20.200 --> 04:24.600
 I will forever be grateful to them for sponsoring this podcast.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.800
 They're awesome people, awesome company, awesome product.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.360
 Okay, back to the read.

04:29.360 --> 04:32.560
 When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST.

04:32.560 --> 04:36.520
 Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with

04:36.520 --> 04:38.580
 as little as one dollar.

04:38.580 --> 04:42.880
 Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin, let me mention that cryptocurrency in the

04:42.880 --> 04:45.360
 context of the history of money is fascinating.

04:45.360 --> 04:48.840
 I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.

04:48.840 --> 04:53.560
 Debits and credits on ledgers started around 30,000 years ago.

04:53.560 --> 04:54.560
 Time flies.

04:54.560 --> 04:59.560
 The US dollar created over 200 years ago and the first decentralized cryptocurrency released

04:59.560 --> 05:01.560
 just over 10 years ago.

05:01.560 --> 05:06.680
 So given that history, cryptocurrency is still very much in its early days of development,

05:06.680 --> 05:11.920
 but it's still aiming to and just might redefine the nature of money.

05:11.920 --> 05:17.200
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use code LEX PODCAST,

05:17.200 --> 05:22.640
 you get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, an organization that is helping

05:22.640 --> 05:27.520
 to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world.

05:27.520 --> 05:32.360
 And now here's my conversation with Sarah Seeger.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.940
 When did you first fall in love with the stars?

05:34.940 --> 05:37.240
 I think I've always loved the stars.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.320
 One of my first memory is of the moon.

05:39.320 --> 05:44.000
 I remember watching the moon and I was in the car with my dad who my parents were divorced

05:44.000 --> 05:47.920
 and he was driving me and my siblings to his house for the weekend and the moon was just

05:47.920 --> 05:49.200
 following me.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.400
 Just had no idea why that was.

05:51.400 --> 05:55.340
 So like looking up at the sky and there's this glowing thing, how do you make sense

05:55.340 --> 05:57.840
 of the moon at that age?

05:57.840 --> 05:58.840
 Like age five.

05:58.840 --> 05:59.840
 There's just no way you can.

05:59.840 --> 06:03.640
 I think it's one of the great things about being a kid is just that curiosity that all

06:03.640 --> 06:04.640
 kids have.

06:04.640 --> 06:11.160
 You know, I was thinking because there's these almost out there ideas of that our earth is

06:11.160 --> 06:14.440
 flat, floating about on the internet.

06:14.440 --> 06:21.120
 And it made me think, you know, when did I first realize that the earth is like this

06:21.120 --> 06:25.780
 ball that's flying through empty space?

06:25.780 --> 06:27.520
 I mean, it's terrifying.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.520
 It's awe inspiring.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.280
 I don't know how to make sense of it.

06:31.280 --> 06:34.840
 It's hard because we live in our frame of reference here on this planet.

06:34.840 --> 06:35.840
 It's nearly impossible.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.240
 None of us are lucky to go to see the curvature of earth.

06:38.240 --> 06:43.360
 I mean, do you remember when you realized, understood like the physics, like the layout

06:43.360 --> 06:45.880
 of the solar system?

06:45.880 --> 06:51.120
 Was it like, did you first have to take physics to really, like high school physics to really

06:51.120 --> 06:52.420
 take that in?

06:52.420 --> 06:53.480
 I think it's hard to say.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.220
 I had this book when I was a child.

06:55.220 --> 06:56.220
 It was in French.

06:56.220 --> 07:01.800
 I grew up in Canada, where French is supposedly taught to all of us English speaking Canadians.

07:01.800 --> 07:05.240
 And it was this book in French was about the solar system, and I just love flipping through

07:05.240 --> 07:06.240
 it.

07:06.240 --> 07:10.120
 It's hard to say how much, you know, you or I understand when we're kids, but it was

07:10.120 --> 07:11.560
 really great book.

07:11.560 --> 07:12.560
 What about the stars?

07:12.560 --> 07:14.920
 When did you first learn about the stars?

07:14.920 --> 07:17.880
 Like I do have this very incredible distinctive memory.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.120
 And again, it had to do with my dad.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.120
 He took us camping.

07:20.120 --> 07:26.040
 Now, my dad was from the UK, and he was the type who you'd find wearing a tie on weekends.

07:26.040 --> 07:29.280
 So camping was not in his sphere, his comfort zone.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.680
 We had a babysitter.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.600
 Every summer we had a babysitter, and one summer we had Tom.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.400
 He was barely older than we were.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.400
 He was 14.

07:37.400 --> 07:38.400
 My brother was 12.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.480
 I would have been 11 or 10 maybe.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.920
 And we went camping because Tom said camping is the thing.

07:42.920 --> 07:43.920
 We should try it.

07:43.920 --> 07:48.200
 And I just remember I didn't aim to see the stars, but I walked out of my tent in the

07:48.200 --> 07:55.360
 middle of the night, and I looked up, and wow, so many stars.

07:55.360 --> 07:59.000
 The dark night sky and all those stars just screaming at me.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.560
 I just couldn't believe that.

08:00.560 --> 08:04.820
 Honestly, my first thought was, this is so incredible, mind blowing.

08:04.820 --> 08:07.320
 Why wouldn't anyone have told me this existed?

08:07.320 --> 08:08.880
 Can anyone else see this?

08:08.880 --> 08:12.680
 Have you had an experience like that with anything?

08:12.680 --> 08:13.680
 Yeah.

08:13.680 --> 08:14.680
 I've had that.

08:14.680 --> 08:17.560
 I mean, I don't know if maybe you can tell me if it's the same.

08:17.560 --> 08:20.000
 I've had that with robots.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.240
 There's a few robots I've met where I just fell in love with this.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.160
 Is anyone else seeing this?

08:25.160 --> 08:34.720
 Is anyone else seeing that here in a robot is our ability to engineer some intelligent

08:34.720 --> 08:39.960
 beings, intelligent beings that we could love, that could love us, that we can interact with

08:39.960 --> 08:44.440
 in some rich ways that we haven't yet discovered?

08:44.440 --> 08:49.540
 Almost like when you get a puppy, instead of a dog, and there's this immediate bond

08:49.540 --> 08:58.800
 and love, and on top of that, ability to engineer it, I had to just pause and hold myself.

08:58.800 --> 09:03.160
 I imagine, I don't have kids, I imagine there's a magic to that as well, where it's a totally

09:03.160 --> 09:04.160
 new experience.

09:04.160 --> 09:05.160
 It's like, what?

09:05.160 --> 09:13.520
 Well, yeah, the stars though, unlike kids or the puppy, it's only a good thing.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.960
 So you felt, you weren't terrified?

09:15.960 --> 09:23.420
 Like to me, when I look at the stars, it's almost paralyzingly scary how little we know

09:23.420 --> 09:26.200
 about the universe, how alone we are.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.120
 I mean, somehow it feels alone.

09:28.120 --> 09:34.800
 I'm not sure if it's just a matter of perspective, but it feels like, wow, there's billions

09:34.800 --> 09:39.360
 of them out there and we know nothing about them.

09:39.360 --> 09:42.680
 And then also immediately to me, somehow mortality comes into it.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.200
 I mean, how did that make you feel at that time?

09:45.200 --> 09:48.880
 I think as a child without articulating it, I felt that same way.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.600
 Just like, wow, this is terrifying.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.600
 What's out there?

09:51.600 --> 09:52.600
 Like, what is this?

09:52.600 --> 09:55.720
 What does it mean about us here?

09:55.720 --> 10:02.200
 You're a scientist, an exo world class scientist, planetary scientist, astronomer.

10:02.200 --> 10:06.960
 Now I'm a bit of an idiot who likes to ask silly questions.

10:06.960 --> 10:12.400
 So some questions are a little bit in the realm of speculation, almost philosophical

10:12.400 --> 10:17.240
 because we know so little and one of the awesome things about your work is you've actually

10:17.240 --> 10:20.840
 put data and real science behind some of the biggest questions that we're all curious

10:20.840 --> 10:21.840
 about.

10:21.840 --> 10:25.640
 But nevertheless, many of the questions might be a little bit speculative.

10:25.640 --> 10:33.120
 So on that topic, just in your sense, do you think we're alone in the universe, human

10:33.120 --> 10:34.120
 beings?

10:34.120 --> 10:36.280
 Do you think there's life out there?

10:36.280 --> 10:40.520
 Well, Lex, the funny thing is, is that as a scientist, I so don't even want to answer

10:40.520 --> 10:41.520
 that.

10:41.520 --> 10:46.160
 I will answer it though, but I just love to say, yeah, we naturally resist that because

10:46.160 --> 10:49.800
 we want numbers and hard facts and not speculation.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.200
 But I do love that question.

10:51.200 --> 10:55.100
 It's a great question and it's one we all wonder about, but I have to give you the scientist

10:55.100 --> 11:01.280
 answer first, which is we'll have the capability to answer that question soon, even starting

11:01.280 --> 11:02.280
 soon.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.840
 How do you define soon?

11:03.840 --> 11:05.200
 How do I define soon?

11:05.200 --> 11:07.000
 So much happened in the last hundred years.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
 Right, right.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.800
 And there's a difference, right, if it's 10 years or 20 years or a hundred years.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.000
 Yeah, there's a difference in that.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.920
 Well, soon could be a decade or two decades.

11:18.920 --> 11:23.200
 Journalists usually don't like that or the people want like tomorrow, they want the news.

11:23.200 --> 11:28.680
 But what it's going to take is telescopes, space telescopes, or very sophisticated ground

11:28.680 --> 11:35.160
 or space telescopes to let us study the atmospheres of other planets far away and to look what's

11:35.160 --> 11:38.640
 in the atmospheres and to look for water, which is needed for life as we know it, to

11:38.640 --> 11:42.080
 look for gases that don't belong that we might attribute to life.

11:42.080 --> 11:45.680
 So we have to do some really nitty gritty astronomy.

11:45.680 --> 11:51.480
 So the promising way to answer this question scientifically is to look for hints of life.

11:51.480 --> 11:55.960
 That's where like many of your ideas come in of what kind of hints might we actually

11:55.960 --> 11:57.200
 see about this life.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.200
 Right, right.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.200
 That's exactly what we need to do.

11:59.200 --> 12:02.600
 And I like the word you chose, hint, because it's going to be a hint.

12:02.600 --> 12:05.600
 It's not going to be a 100% yay, we found it.

12:05.600 --> 12:12.200
 And then it will take future generations to do more careful work to hopefully even find

12:12.200 --> 12:17.640
 a way to send a probe to these distant exoplanets and to really figure this out for us.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.320
 I mean, we'll talk about the details.

12:19.320 --> 12:26.480
 Those are fun, but like the back to the speculation, the zoomed out big picture is, yes, I believe

12:26.480 --> 12:30.020
 absolutely there is life out there somewhere.

12:30.020 --> 12:33.760
 Because the vastness of the universe is incredible.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.780
 It's so breathtaking.

12:35.780 --> 12:40.040
 When we look at the night sky, if you can go to that dark sky, you can see many, many

12:40.040 --> 12:43.480
 hundred or even if you have good eyesight and you're somewhere very dark, you could

12:43.480 --> 12:44.880
 see thousands of stars.

12:44.880 --> 12:51.240
 But in our galaxy, we have hundreds of billions of stars and our universe has hundreds of

12:51.240 --> 12:53.820
 billions of galaxies.

12:53.820 --> 12:57.760
 So think about all those stars out there.

12:57.760 --> 13:02.120
 And even if planets are rare, even if life is rare, just because the number of stars

13:02.120 --> 13:06.800
 is so huge, things have to come together somewhere, someplace in our universe.

13:06.800 --> 13:07.800
 Yeah.

13:07.800 --> 13:14.120
 So amazing to think that somebody might be looking up on another planet in a distant

13:14.120 --> 13:15.120
 galaxy.

13:15.120 --> 13:22.120
 I have to interrupt your reverie and get back to, in our lifetime at least, the short term.

13:22.120 --> 13:24.800
 We only have the nearest stars to look at.

13:24.800 --> 13:29.480
 It's true that there are so many stars, so many hosts for planets that might have life.

13:29.480 --> 13:36.080
 But in the practical question of will we find it, it has to be a star quite close to Earth,

13:36.080 --> 13:40.080
 like a few light years, tens of light years, maybe hundreds of light years.

13:40.080 --> 13:46.800
 And by the way, you've introduced me to a tool of Eyes on Exoplanets, I think that NASA

13:46.800 --> 13:47.800
 has put together.

13:47.800 --> 13:48.800
 Eyes on Exoplanets.

13:48.800 --> 13:49.800
 It's a great software.

13:49.800 --> 13:50.800
 You can download it.

13:50.800 --> 13:51.800
 It's so cool.

13:51.800 --> 13:56.800
 But anyway, can you give a sense of who our neighbors are?

13:56.800 --> 14:00.120
 You said hundreds of light years.

14:00.120 --> 14:04.600
 How many stars are close by?

14:04.600 --> 14:05.600
 What's our neighborhood like?

14:05.600 --> 14:12.640
 Are we talking about five, 10 stars that we might actually have a chance to zoom in on?

14:12.640 --> 14:16.680
 I'm talking about maybe a dozen or two dozen stars.

14:16.680 --> 14:22.960
 And those with planets that look suitable for us to follow up in detail.

14:22.960 --> 14:23.960
 For life.

14:23.960 --> 14:24.960
 Right.

14:24.960 --> 14:29.920
 But one thing that's really exciting in this field is that the very nearest star to Earth

14:29.920 --> 14:34.240
 called Proxima Centauri, it's part of the Alpha Centauri star system.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.240
 Cool name, by the way.

14:35.240 --> 14:36.240
 Yeah, Proxima.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.240
 Whoever names them.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.240
 Nearby.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.520
 Okay, but it sounds cooler than Proxima.

14:40.520 --> 14:44.120
 Proxima Centauri appears to have a planet around it.

14:44.120 --> 14:49.560
 It's about an Earth mass planet in the so called habitable zone or the Goldilocks zone

14:49.560 --> 14:50.560
 of the host star.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.520
 So think about how incredible that is.

14:52.520 --> 14:56.880
 Like out of all the stars out there, even the very nearest star has planets and has

14:56.880 --> 14:58.880
 a planet of huge interest to us.

14:58.880 --> 14:59.880
 Yeah.

14:59.880 --> 15:00.880
 Okay.

15:00.880 --> 15:04.600
 So can we talk about that planet?

15:04.600 --> 15:12.960
 What does it mean to be maybe possibly habitable?

15:12.960 --> 15:14.960
 How does size come into play?

15:14.960 --> 15:21.640
 How does you know what we know about gases and what kind of things are necessary for

15:21.640 --> 15:22.640
 life?

15:22.640 --> 15:26.800
 You know, what are the factors that you make you think that it's habitable?

15:26.800 --> 15:31.280
 And by the way, I mean, maybe one way to talk about that is people know about the Drake

15:31.280 --> 15:39.400
 equation, which is a very high level, almost framework to think about what is the probability

15:39.400 --> 15:46.240
 that, correct me if I'm wrong, that there's life out there and intelligent life, I think.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.240
 I don't know.

15:47.240 --> 15:54.040
 But then you have a equation named after you now, which I think nicely focuses in on the

15:54.040 --> 16:01.760
 more achievable and interesting part of that question, which is on whether there is habitable

16:01.760 --> 16:04.440
 planets out there or how many, I guess.

16:04.440 --> 16:05.440
 Right, right.

16:05.440 --> 16:11.000
 So the funny thing is, was one time I met Frank Drake and I asked if he minded if I

16:11.000 --> 16:17.360
 took his equation and kind of revamped it for this new field of exoplanet astronomy.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.360
 He was totally cool with it.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.360
 He's totally cool.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.360
 He got total approval.

16:20.360 --> 16:21.360
 Well, maybe.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.360
 Okay.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.360
 So sorry.

16:23.360 --> 16:26.000
 I'm not sure if he'd actually read the stuff about my equation, but he was cool with it.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
 He was cool.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
 He was cool.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
 Okay.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.880
 So I just said like 15 different things, but maybe can you tell from your perspective,

16:33.880 --> 16:37.400
 what is the Drake equation and what is, sorry, the Seager equation?

16:37.400 --> 16:38.400
 Sure.

16:38.400 --> 16:41.800
 Well, the Drake equation, as you said, it's a framework.

16:41.800 --> 16:48.440
 It's a description of the number of civilizations out there of intelligent beings that are able

16:48.440 --> 16:53.040
 to communicate with us by radio waves.

16:53.040 --> 16:58.040
 So if you think of the movie Contact, you've seen Contact, right?

16:58.040 --> 16:59.040
 We're listening in, actually.

16:59.040 --> 17:03.320
 It's an active field of research, listening to other stars at radio wavelengths, hoping

17:03.320 --> 17:07.240
 that some intelligent civilizations are sending us a message.

17:07.240 --> 17:12.920
 And the Drake equation came like at the start of that whole field to put the factors down

17:12.920 --> 17:18.020
 on paper to sort of illustrate what is involved to kind of estimating.

17:18.020 --> 17:21.520
 And there's no real estimate or prediction of how many civilizations are out there, but

17:21.520 --> 17:25.680
 it's a way to frame the question and show you each term that's involved.

17:25.680 --> 17:32.140
 So I took the Drake equation and I called it a revised Drake equation and I recast it

17:32.140 --> 17:37.920
 for the search for planets by more traditional astronomy means.

17:37.920 --> 17:42.680
 We're looking at stars, looking for planets, looking for rocky planets, looking for planets

17:42.680 --> 17:49.520
 that are the right temperature for life, looking for planets that might have life that outputs

17:49.520 --> 17:52.100
 gases that we might detect in the future.

17:52.100 --> 17:53.840
 It's the same spirit of the Drake equation.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.480
 It's not going to give us any magic numbers.

17:55.480 --> 17:58.680
 So I'm going to say, hey, here's exactly what's out there.

17:58.680 --> 18:01.360
 It's meant to kind of guide, guide of where we're going.

18:01.360 --> 18:06.480
 So the Drake equation did, I mean the initial equation proposed actual numbers for those

18:06.480 --> 18:07.480
 variables, right?

18:07.480 --> 18:08.480
 Oh yes.

18:08.480 --> 18:12.240
 The equation proposed numbers and you can still plug your own numbers in.

18:12.240 --> 18:15.960
 And there's this really cute website that lets you for both the Drake and my revised

18:15.960 --> 18:19.280
 equation plug in some numbers and see what you got.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.280
 So yeah.

18:20.280 --> 18:21.280
 Okay.

18:21.280 --> 18:24.600
 So what are, I mean, what are the variables, but maybe also what are like the critical

18:24.600 --> 18:26.320
 variables?

18:26.320 --> 18:33.640
 So in my equation, I set out to what are the numbers of inhabited planets that show signs

18:33.640 --> 18:37.520
 of life by way of gases in the atmosphere that can be attributed to life.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.520
 I could just walk through the terms as far as I'm aware.

18:39.520 --> 18:43.200
 So the first thing I say is what are the number of stars available?

18:43.200 --> 18:47.760
 And it's not that those trillions and trillions of stars everywhere.

18:47.760 --> 18:51.320
 It's what are available to like a specific search.

18:51.320 --> 18:57.540
 And so for example, the MIT led NASA mission TESS is surveying the sky, looking for all

18:57.540 --> 19:01.600
 kinds of planets, but it can also, it also has stars.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.780
 It has about 30,000 red dwarf stars.

19:04.780 --> 19:08.920
 So we just take a number of stars that a given survey can access.

19:08.920 --> 19:11.160
 So that's what the number of stars is.

19:11.160 --> 19:16.000
 Then I wanted to know what kind of stars are quiet.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.120
 I called it fraction of those stars that is quiet.

19:19.120 --> 19:23.680
 In the case of TESS, the way it's looking for planets is planets that transit the star.

19:23.680 --> 19:27.600
 They go in front of the star as seen from the telescope, but it turns out that some

19:27.600 --> 19:32.580
 stars are very active, they're variable and they brighten and dim with time and that interferes

19:32.580 --> 19:33.580
 with our observation.

19:33.580 --> 19:35.440
 I apologize to interrupt.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.280
 So it's a transiting planet.

19:37.280 --> 19:42.000
 So you're really looking for a black blob, essentially that blocks the light.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.560
 We're looking for a black blob that blocks the light and then trying to say something

19:45.560 --> 19:51.920
 about the size of the planet from the frequency of that black blobs appearance and the size

19:51.920 --> 19:53.560
 of that black blob, that kind of thing.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.560
 Yeah.

19:54.560 --> 19:58.560
 But let's just say that out of all the stars there are accessible to whatever telescope,

19:58.560 --> 20:00.520
 some of them are just bad for whatever reason.

20:00.520 --> 20:02.640
 You're not going to be able to find planets around them.

20:02.640 --> 20:05.960
 So I need to know the fraction of those that are, that are good.

20:05.960 --> 20:09.200
 So again, we have the number of stars, the fraction of them that we can actually find

20:09.200 --> 20:10.200
 planets around.

20:10.200 --> 20:16.520
 And by the way, is our sun one such, is our sun quiet?

20:16.520 --> 20:17.520
 Our sun is quiet.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.520
 Okay.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.280
 So I have actually two terms.

20:20.280 --> 20:25.580
 One describes how quiet they are and one is if we can find a planet around that star.

20:25.580 --> 20:30.180
 These transiting planets, for example, not all planets transit because the planet would

20:30.180 --> 20:36.360
 have to be orbiting that star in this kind of plane as viewed from you.

20:36.360 --> 20:40.360
 But if a star is, for example, orbiting in the plane of the sky, it will never transit.

20:40.360 --> 20:43.000
 It will never go in front of the star.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.560
 So in that case, we have to have a fraction that takes into account of that kind of geometric

20:47.560 --> 20:48.640
 factor.

20:48.640 --> 20:52.840
 And hopefully, I mean, you can assume that it's uniformly distributed, hopefully.

20:52.840 --> 20:56.980
 Yes, we can assume and there's evidence that it's uniformly distributed, yes.

20:56.980 --> 21:01.600
 So then the next, so all of these factors so far, number of stars accessible to whatever

21:01.600 --> 21:06.520
 telescope you're thinking about, how many stars are quiet, fraction of stars that are

21:06.520 --> 21:10.380
 quiet, fraction that are observable, in this case for the geometric factor, those are all

21:10.380 --> 21:11.380
 things we can measure.

21:11.380 --> 21:14.920
 And there's one more term in the secret equation we can measure.

21:14.920 --> 21:18.540
 I call it fraction of planets in the habitable zone.

21:18.540 --> 21:23.760
 Because believe it or not, we have a handle on that for a certain set of stars.

21:23.760 --> 21:28.520
 We know from our, the Kepler Space Telescope that operated for a number of years, we have

21:28.520 --> 21:31.840
 estimates for how many planets are in the so called habitable zone of the host star

21:31.840 --> 21:33.420
 for a certain type of star.

21:33.420 --> 21:34.960
 So all those we have measurable.

21:34.960 --> 21:39.280
 And then like the Drake equation itself, there are some terms we can not measure.

21:39.280 --> 21:46.280
 And those ones, I call them FL, fraction of all those planets that have life on them.

21:46.280 --> 21:47.400
 Because we don't know what that is.

21:47.400 --> 21:55.300
 And FS, I called for spectroscopy, the fraction that have, we can use our telescope and instrument

21:55.300 --> 21:58.080
 tools to look for light.

21:58.080 --> 22:03.880
 The FS was the ones that, the planets that have life that actually gives off a gas, a

22:03.880 --> 22:10.160
 useful gas that might accumulate in the atmosphere, so we could eventually observe it.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.280
 How do the FL and FS interplay?

22:12.280 --> 22:14.320
 So these are separate terms?

22:14.320 --> 22:15.560
 Separate terms.

22:15.560 --> 22:16.560
 And so?

22:16.560 --> 22:23.720
 So for example, you could imagine, so for example, you could imagine life, like us humans,

22:23.720 --> 22:26.680
 we breathe out carbon dioxide.

22:26.680 --> 22:29.560
 And our planet Earth, we already have a lot of carbon dioxide on it.

22:29.560 --> 22:33.600
 Well, we have hundreds of parts per million, but it has a really strong signal.

22:33.600 --> 22:37.500
 So us humans breathing out carbon dioxide, it's not helpful for any intelligent beings

22:37.500 --> 22:41.120
 that are looking back at Earth, because there's already a lot of, there's already enough carbon

22:41.120 --> 22:43.060
 dioxide, we're not adding to it.

22:43.060 --> 22:47.320
 So if there is life on a planet, and it's outputting a boring gas that's not helpful

22:47.320 --> 22:54.440
 for us to uniquely identify as being made by life versus just being there anyway, then

22:54.440 --> 22:55.440
 it's not helpful.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.960
 So I separated those two terms out.

22:57.960 --> 23:04.320
 Soon I think we'll have evidence that planets that can support life at least are common.

23:04.320 --> 23:11.080
 So okay, this is such an awesome topic, I have a million questions.

23:11.080 --> 23:16.080
 What okay, I know this is a little bit of speculation, but what's your sense about that,

23:16.080 --> 23:23.760
 I think FS, which is like, that life would produce interesting gases that would be able

23:23.760 --> 23:30.480
 to detect, like, is there, one, is there scientific evidence and, and second, is there some intuition

23:30.480 --> 23:36.820
 around life producing gases with detectable hints in terms of chemistry?

23:36.820 --> 23:43.160
 So interestingly enough, that entire question relates to, I'm going to say almost my life's

23:43.160 --> 23:46.520
 work, the work I'm doing now and the work I'm doing for the next 20 years, and I wish

23:46.520 --> 23:51.440
 I could give you a concrete number, like 1%, like on the worst days, it's 1%, let's say

23:51.440 --> 23:52.440
 in my mind.

23:52.440 --> 23:54.480
 You know, in the best days, it's like 80%.

23:54.480 --> 23:58.400
 And I could actually go into a lot of detail here, but I'll just give you the simplest

23:58.400 --> 23:59.920
 things.

23:59.920 --> 24:05.800
 So first of all, we make an assumption that like us, and our life here on Earth, life

24:05.800 --> 24:07.700
 uses chemistry.

24:07.700 --> 24:13.120
 So we use chemistry because we eat food, we breathe air, and we have metabolism that to

24:13.120 --> 24:18.820
 break down food to get energy to store energy, and then ultimately to use it.

24:18.820 --> 24:22.560
 And all life here has some kind of byproduct in doing all that, some kind of waste product

24:22.560 --> 24:24.400
 that goes into the atmosphere.

24:24.400 --> 24:28.700
 So I like to think that life everywhere uses chemistry.

24:28.700 --> 24:34.280
 Some people have imagined, like, let's imagine like a windmill, like mechanical energy, just

24:34.280 --> 24:37.120
 getting energy and using it without storing it.

24:37.120 --> 24:40.840
 And if there was life like that, it might not need to output a gas.

24:40.840 --> 24:44.040
 So we make this basic assumption of chemistry, that's the first thing.

24:44.040 --> 24:47.960
 The second more complicated thing that I and my team work on is what happens to the gas

24:47.960 --> 24:51.980
 once it is produced by life, it goes into the atmosphere.

24:51.980 --> 24:59.600
 And a lot of gas is just destroyed immediately, actually, by ultraviolet radiation or by oxygen.

24:59.600 --> 25:03.540
 Oxygen is incredibly destructive to a lot of gases.

25:03.540 --> 25:07.280
 So the gas can be produced by life, but it could be just completely destroyed by its

25:07.280 --> 25:08.280
 environment.

25:08.280 --> 25:13.800
 I guess we should pause on that, that you mentioned your life's work.

25:13.800 --> 25:19.280
 This is just the beautiful idea that it's kind of paralyzing when you look out there

25:19.280 --> 25:22.720
 and you wonder, is there a life out there?

25:22.720 --> 25:27.360
 It's the first paralyzing, actually, before I encountered your work, I feel like an idiot.

25:27.360 --> 25:32.860
 But you know, it feels like there's no tool to answer that question.

25:32.860 --> 25:40.000
 And then what you kind of provided is this cool idea that it might be possible to answer

25:40.000 --> 25:41.240
 that by looking at the gases.

25:41.240 --> 25:45.720
 I mean, that's a really interesting, that's a beautiful idea.

25:45.720 --> 25:55.280
 And yeah, so we could just pause on like, that's a powerful tool, I think, to build

25:55.280 --> 25:57.800
 the intuition around, because I was totally clueless about it.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.440
 And that was kind of exciting.

25:59.440 --> 26:05.760
 I mean, I'm sure there's folks probably early on in your life who were very skeptical about

26:05.760 --> 26:06.760
 this notion.

26:06.760 --> 26:13.320
 Well, maybe I'm not sure, but generally you would want to be skeptical, it's like, well,

26:13.320 --> 26:17.000
 all these kinds of other things could generate gases, you know, all those kinds of things.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
 Oh, that's so true.

26:18.000 --> 26:23.240
 And that's a big part of this growing field is how to make sure that this gas isn't produced

26:23.240 --> 26:24.240
 by another effect.

26:24.240 --> 26:29.000
 But I do want to, you know, again, pausing on that and going back a bit.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.100
 It's incredible to think, but like, at least almost 100 years ago, there's a record of

26:33.100 --> 26:38.720
 someone talking about the idea of a gas being an indicator of life elsewhere.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.240
 That idea was floating about somewhere.

26:40.240 --> 26:42.040
 Yes, it was totally floating about.

26:42.040 --> 26:48.440
 And it comes down to oxygen, which on our planet fills our atmosphere to 20% by volume.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.600
 And you know, we rely on oxygen to breathe.

26:50.600 --> 26:54.280
 You know, when you hear about the people in Mount Everest running out of air, they're

26:54.280 --> 26:57.660
 really running out of oxygen, well, they're running out of oxygen because the air is getting

26:57.660 --> 27:01.680
 thinner as they climb up the mountain.

27:01.680 --> 27:08.680
 But without plants and bacteria, there's bacteria that also photosynthesizes and produces oxygen

27:08.680 --> 27:09.680
 as a waste product.

27:09.680 --> 27:13.040
 Without those, we would have virtually no oxygen.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.480
 Our atmosphere would be devoid of oxygen.

27:15.480 --> 27:21.900
 So yeah, if you were to analyze Earth, is oxygen the strong indicator here?

27:21.900 --> 27:22.900
 Oxygen is a huge indicator.

27:22.900 --> 27:26.720
 And that's what we're hoping, that there is an intelligent civilization not too far from

27:26.720 --> 27:31.440
 here around a planet orbiting a nearby star with the kind of telescopes we're trying to

27:31.440 --> 27:32.440
 build.

27:32.440 --> 27:36.740
 And they're looking back at our sun and they've seen our Earth and they see oxygen.

27:36.740 --> 27:41.620
 And they probably won't be like 100.0% sure that there's life making it.

27:41.620 --> 27:45.820
 But if they go through all the possible scenarios, they'll be left with a pretty strong hint

27:45.820 --> 27:46.820
 that there's life here.

27:46.820 --> 27:47.820
 Yeah.

27:47.820 --> 27:55.360
 Okay, but how do you detect that type of gases that are on the planet from a distance?

27:55.360 --> 28:00.160
 And that's going back to that, that's what people were skeptical about.

28:00.160 --> 28:04.800
 When I first started working on exoplanets a long time ago, people didn't believe we

28:04.800 --> 28:09.500
 would ever, ever, ever study an exoplanet atmosphere of any kind.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.320
 And now dozens of them are studied.

28:11.320 --> 28:14.520
 There's a whole field of people, hundreds of people working on exoplanet atmospheres

28:14.520 --> 28:15.520
 actually.

28:15.520 --> 28:16.520
 Wow.

28:16.520 --> 28:20.240
 But first there was a point where people didn't even know there was exoplanets, right?

28:20.240 --> 28:23.100
 When was the first exoplanet detected?

28:23.100 --> 28:27.200
 The first exoplanet around a sun like star anyway was detected in the mid 1990s.

28:27.200 --> 28:29.600
 That was a big deal.

28:29.600 --> 28:30.600
 Kind of vaguely remember that.

28:30.600 --> 28:34.840
 Well, at the time it was a big deal, but it was also incredibly controversial.

28:34.840 --> 28:41.280
 Because in exoplanets, we only had one example of a planetary system, our own solar system.

28:41.280 --> 28:48.000
 And in our solar system, Jupiter, our big massive planet, is really far from our star.

28:48.000 --> 28:53.000
 And this first exoplanet around a sun like star was incredibly close to its star, so

28:53.000 --> 28:56.180
 close that people just couldn't believe it was a planet actually.

28:56.180 --> 29:00.080
 So maybe zoom out, what the heck is an exoplanet?

29:00.080 --> 29:05.500
 An exoplanet is our name, like is the name that we call a planet orbiting a star other

29:05.500 --> 29:07.000
 than our sun.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
 Right.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
 Extrasolar, I guess is another.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
 You can call it extrasolar.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
 Okay.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
 Exoplanet is simpler.

29:12.000 --> 29:17.140
 But I think it's worth pausing to remember that each one of those stars out there in

29:17.140 --> 29:18.800
 our night sky is a sun.

29:18.800 --> 29:23.440
 And you know, our sun has planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, etc.

29:23.440 --> 29:29.160
 And so for a long time, people have wondered, do those other stars or other suns have planets?

29:29.160 --> 29:30.160
 And they do.

29:30.160 --> 29:34.040
 And it appears that nearly every star has a planet, has a planet we call exoplanet.

29:34.040 --> 29:37.000
 And there are thousands of known exoplanets already.

29:37.000 --> 29:42.120
 So there's already, yeah, like, there's so many things about space that it's hard to

29:42.120 --> 29:47.520
 put into one's brain, because it starts filling it with awe.

29:47.520 --> 29:54.920
 So yeah, if you visualize the fact that the stars that we see in the sky aren't just stars,

29:54.920 --> 29:57.160
 they're like, they're suns.

29:57.160 --> 30:03.520
 And they very likely, as you're saying, would have planets around them.

30:03.520 --> 30:11.240
 There's all these planets roaming about in this like, dimly lit darkness, with potentially

30:11.240 --> 30:12.240
 life.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.920
 I mean, it's just mind blowing.

30:14.920 --> 30:23.120
 But maybe can you give a brief, like, history of discovering all the exoplanets?

30:23.120 --> 30:26.320
 So there's no exoplanets in the 90s.

30:26.320 --> 30:28.500
 And then there's a lot of exoplanets now.

30:28.500 --> 30:29.600
 So how did that come about?

30:29.600 --> 30:31.520
 So many planets.

30:31.520 --> 30:32.520
 How did it come about?

30:32.520 --> 30:37.120
 Well, maybe another way to ask is, what is the methodology that was used to discover

30:37.120 --> 30:38.120
 them?

30:38.120 --> 30:39.120
 I can say that.

30:39.120 --> 30:43.680
 But I'd like to just say something else first where, so exoplanets, you know, the line

30:43.680 --> 30:47.160
 between what is considered completely crazy.

30:47.160 --> 30:51.600
 And what is considered mainstream research, legit, is constantly shifting.

30:51.600 --> 30:52.600
 This is awesome.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.600
 Yeah.

30:53.600 --> 30:56.040
 So before, when I started on exoplanets, it was still sketchy.

30:56.040 --> 31:01.280
 Like, it wasn't considered a career, a thing, a place where you should be investing.

31:01.280 --> 31:06.840
 And right now, now, today, it's so many people are working in this field, a good, I don't

31:06.840 --> 31:08.480
 know, at least 1000, probably more.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.840
 I don't know if that sounds like a lot to you, but it's a lot.

31:10.840 --> 31:13.800
 No, it's a legitimate field of inquiry.

31:13.800 --> 31:14.800
 Yeah.

31:14.800 --> 31:15.800
 Legitimate field of inquiry.

31:15.800 --> 31:18.000
 And what's helped us is everything that's helped everyone else.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.720
 It's software, it's computers, it's hardware.

31:21.720 --> 31:22.720
 It's like our phones.

31:22.720 --> 31:23.960
 You have a fantastic detector in there.

31:23.960 --> 31:25.120
 Like, they didn't always have that.

31:25.120 --> 31:28.080
 I don't know if you remember the so called olden days.

31:28.080 --> 31:29.300
 We didn't have digital cameras.

31:29.300 --> 31:30.580
 We had film.

31:30.580 --> 31:33.680
 You take a film camera, you send the film away, and eventually it comes back, and then

31:33.680 --> 31:34.680
 you see your pictures.

31:34.680 --> 31:35.680
 And they could all be horrible.

31:35.680 --> 31:36.680
 Yeah.

31:36.680 --> 31:37.680
 So yeah, I mean, digital.

31:37.680 --> 31:38.680
 It just changed everything.

31:38.680 --> 31:39.680
 Data changed everything.

31:39.680 --> 31:45.920
 Yeah, and so one thing that really helped exoplanets were detectors that were very sensitive.

31:45.920 --> 31:51.100
 Because when we're looking for the transiting planets, what we're doing is we're monitoring

31:51.100 --> 31:53.840
 a star's brightness as a function of time.

31:53.840 --> 31:58.840
 It's like click, taking a picture of the stars every few seconds or minutes.

31:58.840 --> 32:02.960
 And we're measuring the brightness of a star, like every frame.

32:02.960 --> 32:06.700
 And we're looking for a drop in brightness that's characteristic of a planet going in

32:06.700 --> 32:11.680
 front of the star, and then finishing its so called transit.

32:11.680 --> 32:15.960
 And to make that measurement, we have to have precise detectors.

32:15.960 --> 32:22.080
 And the detectors that are making the measurement, can you do it from Earth?

32:22.080 --> 32:25.920
 Are they floating about in space, like what kind of telescope?

32:25.920 --> 32:30.260
 So on the ground, people are using telescopes, small telescopes that are almost just like

32:30.260 --> 32:32.520
 a glorified telephoto lens.

32:32.520 --> 32:35.140
 And they're looking at big swaths of the sky.

32:35.140 --> 32:38.820
 And from the ground, people can find giant planets like the size of Jupiter.

32:38.820 --> 32:41.700
 So it's about 10 to 12 times the size of Earth.

32:41.700 --> 32:46.320
 We can find big planets, because we can reach about 1% precision.

32:46.320 --> 32:48.680
 So not sure how technical you want to get.

32:48.680 --> 32:53.080
 Well, how many pixels are we talking about?

32:53.080 --> 32:56.820
 You mentioned phones, there's a bunch of megapixels, I think.

32:56.820 --> 33:01.240
 So for exoplanets, you want to think about it as like a pixel or less than a pixel, we're

33:01.240 --> 33:03.940
 not getting any information.

33:03.940 --> 33:08.040
 But to be more technical, our telescope spreads the light out over many pixels, but we're

33:08.040 --> 33:09.300
 not getting information.

33:09.300 --> 33:12.300
 We're not tiling the planet with pixels.

33:12.300 --> 33:16.320
 It's just like a point of light, or in most cases, we don't even see the planet itself,

33:16.320 --> 33:17.920
 just the planet's effect on the star.

33:17.920 --> 33:22.640
 But another thing that really helped was computers, because transiting planets are actually quite

33:22.640 --> 33:23.640
 rare.

33:23.640 --> 33:25.560
 I mean, they don't all go in front of their star.

33:25.560 --> 33:29.880
 And so to find transiting planets, we look at a big part of the sky at once, or we look

33:29.880 --> 33:34.100
 at tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands, or even in some cases, millions of stars at

33:34.100 --> 33:35.520
 one time.

33:35.520 --> 33:39.400
 And so you're not going to do this by hand, going through a million stars, counting up

33:39.400 --> 33:40.400
 the brightness.

33:40.400 --> 33:47.600
 So we have computer software and computer code that does the job for us and counts the

33:47.600 --> 33:51.880
 brightness and looks for a signal that could be due to a transiting planet.

33:51.880 --> 33:59.440
 And I just finished a job called Deputy Science Director for the MIT led NASA mission test.

33:59.440 --> 34:05.880
 And it was my purview to make sure that we got the planet candidates, the transiting

34:05.880 --> 34:10.280
 light curves, out to the community so people could follow them up and figure out if they're

34:10.280 --> 34:13.360
 actual planets or false positives.

34:13.360 --> 34:19.260
 So publish the data so that people could just, all the data scientists out there could crunch

34:19.260 --> 34:21.080
 and see if they can discover something.

34:21.080 --> 34:22.080
 They can discover something.

34:22.080 --> 34:26.760
 And in fact, the NASA policy for this mission is that all the data becomes public as soon

34:26.760 --> 34:28.360
 as possible.

34:28.360 --> 34:33.680
 It's not as easy as it sounds, though, to download the data and look for planets.

34:33.680 --> 34:38.600
 But there is a group called PlanetHunters.org, and they take the data and they actually crowdsource

34:38.600 --> 34:40.200
 it out to people to look for planets.

34:40.200 --> 34:41.200
 Yeah.

34:41.200 --> 34:44.940
 And they often find signals that our computers and our team missed.

34:44.940 --> 34:46.880
 So we mentioned exoplanets.

34:46.880 --> 34:51.920
 What about Earth like, or I don't know what the right distinction is, is it habitable

34:51.920 --> 34:55.940
 or is it Earth like planets, but what are those different categories and how can we

34:55.940 --> 34:57.840
 tell the difference and detect each?

34:57.840 --> 34:58.840
 Right, right.

34:58.840 --> 35:01.360
 So we're not at Earth like planets yet.

35:01.360 --> 35:06.680
 All the planets we're finding are so different from what we have in our solar system.

35:06.680 --> 35:08.640
 They're just easier planets to find, but like...

35:08.640 --> 35:09.640
 In which way?

35:09.640 --> 35:14.740
 For example, there could be a Jupiter sized planet where an Earth should be.

35:14.740 --> 35:20.720
 We find planets that are the same size as Earth, but are orbiting way closer to their

35:20.720 --> 35:24.080
 star than Mercury is to our sun.

35:24.080 --> 35:29.160
 They're so close that, because close to a star means they also orbit faster.

35:29.160 --> 35:33.860
 And some of these hot super Earths we call them, their year, their time to go around

35:33.860 --> 35:36.940
 their star is less than a day.

35:36.940 --> 35:40.480
 And they're heated so much by their star, they're heated so much by the star.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.920
 We think the surface is hot enough to melt rock.

35:42.920 --> 35:47.520
 So instead of running out by the bay or the river, you'll have like liquid lava.

35:47.520 --> 35:51.480
 There'll be liquid lava lakes on these planets, we think.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.520
 And life can't survive.

35:53.520 --> 35:54.520
 Way too hot.

35:54.520 --> 35:59.760
 The molecules needed for life just wouldn't be able to survive those temperatures.

35:59.760 --> 36:00.760
 We have some other planets.

36:00.760 --> 36:07.000
 One of the most mysterious things out there, factoid, if you will, is that the most common

36:07.000 --> 36:12.920
 type of planet we know about so far is a planet that's in between Earth and Neptune size.

36:12.920 --> 36:15.680
 It's two to three times the size of Earth.

36:15.680 --> 36:19.840
 And we have no solar system counterpart of that planet.

36:19.840 --> 36:24.000
 That is like going outside to the forest and finding some kind of creature or animal that

36:24.000 --> 36:27.360
 just no one has ever seen before and then discovering that is the most common thing

36:27.360 --> 36:29.320
 out there.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.560
 And so we're not even sure what they are.

36:30.560 --> 36:34.300
 We have a lot of thoughts as to the different types of planet it could be, but people don't

36:34.300 --> 36:35.300
 really know.

36:35.300 --> 36:37.560
 I mean, what are your thoughts about what it could be?

36:37.560 --> 36:43.260
 Well, one thought, and this is more when we want to be rather than might be, is that these

36:43.260 --> 36:48.540
 so called mini Neptunes, we call them, that they are water worlds, that they could be

36:48.540 --> 36:54.360
 scaled up versions of Jupiter's icy moons, such that they are planets that are made of

36:54.360 --> 36:57.400
 more than half of water by mass.

36:57.400 --> 37:02.040
 And what's the connection between water and life and the possibility of seeing that from

37:02.040 --> 37:03.600
 a gas perspective?

37:03.600 --> 37:07.580
 Okay, so all life on Earth needs liquid water.

37:07.580 --> 37:12.400
 And so there's been this idea in astronomy or astrobiology for a long time called follow

37:12.400 --> 37:16.960
 the water, find water, that will give you a chance of finding life, but we could still

37:16.960 --> 37:24.680
 zoom out and the community consensus is that we need some kind of liquid for life to originate

37:24.680 --> 37:28.360
 and to survive because molecules have to react.

37:28.360 --> 37:31.560
 You don't have a way that molecules can interact with each other.

37:31.560 --> 37:32.800
 You can't really make anything.

37:32.800 --> 37:38.100
 And so when we think of all the liquids out there, water is the most abundant liquid in

37:38.100 --> 37:39.640
 terms of planetary materials.

37:39.640 --> 37:40.920
 There really aren't that many liquids.

37:40.920 --> 37:44.640
 Like I mentioned, liquid rock, way too hot for life.

37:44.640 --> 37:49.600
 We have some really cold liquids, like almost gasoline, like ethane and methane lakes that

37:49.600 --> 37:52.880
 have been found on one of Saturn's moons, Titan.

37:52.880 --> 37:53.920
 That's so cold though.

37:53.920 --> 37:57.420
 And for exoplanets, we can't study really cold planets because they're just simply too

37:57.420 --> 38:00.480
 dark and too cold.

38:00.480 --> 38:05.040
 So we usually are just left with looking for planets with liquid water.

38:05.040 --> 38:12.920
 And to your point, remember as we talked about how planets are less than a pixel in that

38:12.920 --> 38:15.440
 way to say, so we can't see oceans on planet.

38:15.440 --> 38:19.520
 We're not going to see continents and oceans, not yet anyway, but we can see gases in the

38:19.520 --> 38:20.520
 atmosphere.

38:20.520 --> 38:26.840
 And if it's a small rocky planet, and this is going into some more detail, if we see

38:26.840 --> 38:31.200
 a small rocky planet with water vapor in the atmosphere, we're pretty sure that means there

38:31.200 --> 38:37.480
 has to be a liquid water reservoir because it's not intuitive in any way, but water is

38:37.480 --> 38:42.360
 broken up by ultraviolet radiation from the star or from the sun.

38:42.360 --> 38:47.600
 And on most planets when water is broken up into H and O, the H, the hydrogen will escape

38:47.600 --> 38:48.600
 to space.

38:48.600 --> 38:53.440
 Because just like when you think of a child letting go of a helium filled balloon, it

38:53.440 --> 38:58.860
 floats upwards and hydrogen is a light gas and will leave from the planet.

38:58.860 --> 39:03.220
 So ultimately if you have water, unless there's an ocean, like a way to keep replenishing

39:03.220 --> 39:08.480
 water vapor in the atmosphere, that water vapor should be destroyed by ultraviolet radiation.

39:08.480 --> 39:16.400
 Got it, so there's a, okay, so there's a need for liquid, I mean, I guess it was water.

39:16.400 --> 39:21.080
 Is water essential or are the liquids, I mean, the chemistry here is probably super complicated.

39:21.080 --> 39:24.160
 It does, but you know, there's not an infinite number of liquids.

39:24.160 --> 39:28.680
 There's maybe like five liquids that can exist inside or on the surface of a planet.

39:28.680 --> 39:32.440
 And water is the one that exists for the largest range of temperatures and pressures.

39:32.440 --> 39:37.360
 And it's also the easiest type of planet for us to find and study is one with water vapor

39:37.360 --> 39:41.360
 rather than a cold planet that has ethane and methane lakes.

39:41.360 --> 39:48.760
 What's your personal, in terms of solar systems and planets that you're most hopeful about

39:48.760 --> 39:57.320
 in terms of our closest neighbors that you kind of have a sense that there might be somebody

39:57.320 --> 40:02.840
 living over there, whether it's bacteria or somebody that looks like us.

40:02.840 --> 40:06.520
 I'm hopeful that every star nearby has a planet.

40:06.520 --> 40:07.520
 That has some life.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.840
 Because it almost has to for us to make progress.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.560
 We have to have that dream condition.

40:12.560 --> 40:16.760
 So the dream condition is like life is just super abundant out there.

40:16.760 --> 40:21.280
 Yeah, the dream, yes, the dream condition is that life is super abundant and it's based

40:21.280 --> 40:27.480
 on the thought that if there is a planet with water and continents, that it also has the

40:27.480 --> 40:36.300
 ingredients for life and that the kind of base kernel thought is that if the ingredients

40:36.300 --> 40:37.680
 for life is there, life will form.

40:37.680 --> 40:38.680
 Life will form.

40:38.680 --> 40:39.680
 That's what we're holding on to.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.880
 With a relatively high probability.

40:41.880 --> 40:43.520
 Yes, that's it.

40:43.520 --> 40:46.740
 Okay, let's go into land of speculation.

40:46.740 --> 40:49.600
 What about intelligent life?

40:49.600 --> 40:56.320
 Us humans consider ourselves intelligent, surprisingly or unsurprisingly.

40:56.320 --> 41:02.560
 Do you think about from your perspective of looking at planets from a gas composition

41:02.560 --> 41:10.400
 perspective and in general of how we might see intelligent life and your intuition about

41:10.400 --> 41:12.400
 whether that life is even out there?

41:12.400 --> 41:14.760
 I think the life is out there somewhere.

41:14.760 --> 41:17.520
 The huge numbers of stars and planets.

41:17.520 --> 41:21.480
 I like to think that life had a chance to evolve to be intelligent.

41:21.480 --> 41:26.620
 I'm not convinced the life is anywhere near here, only because if it's hard for intelligent

41:26.620 --> 41:29.720
 life to evolve, then it will be far away by definition.

41:29.720 --> 41:36.080
 Well, the sad thing is maybe from the artificial intelligence perspective is it makes me sad

41:36.080 --> 41:43.160
 there might be intelligent life out there that we're just not like the pathways of evolution

41:43.160 --> 41:47.440
 can go in all these different directions where we might not be able to communicate with it

41:47.440 --> 41:52.720
 or even know that or even detect its intelligence or even comprehend its intelligence.

41:52.720 --> 41:59.480
 I'm convinced cats are more intelligent than humans that we're just not able to comprehend

41:59.480 --> 42:04.980
 the measures, the proper measures of their intelligence.

42:04.980 --> 42:06.200
 My dog is so funny.

42:06.200 --> 42:07.200
 He's a golden doodle.

42:07.200 --> 42:08.280
 His name's Leo.

42:08.280 --> 42:12.420
 We joke that he's either a really dumb dog and sorry, he's not here to defend himself,

42:12.420 --> 42:16.280
 but he's either really dumb or he's a super genius just pretending to be dumb.

42:16.280 --> 42:17.280
 Yeah.

42:17.280 --> 42:25.400
 And it's possible he's a multidimensional projection of alien life here monitoring one

42:25.400 --> 42:33.480
 of the top scientists in the world trying to find aliens just to make sure that humans

42:33.480 --> 42:34.480
 don't get out of hand.

42:34.480 --> 42:35.480
 That's funny.

42:35.480 --> 42:39.960
 Oh, I'm definitely going to go in and ask him about that when I get home.

42:39.960 --> 42:40.960
 She's onto something.

42:40.960 --> 42:41.960
 Yeah.

42:41.960 --> 42:46.580
 What might we look for in terms of signs of intelligent life?

42:46.580 --> 42:54.240
 From your toolkit, do you think there are things that we might be able to use or maybe

42:54.240 --> 43:00.960
 in the next couple of decades discover that would be different than life that's like bacteria,

43:00.960 --> 43:03.080
 that's primitive life?

43:03.080 --> 43:06.320
 I still love SETI, Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

43:06.320 --> 43:10.880
 I like to hope that if there is a civilization out there, they're trying to send us a message.

43:10.880 --> 43:13.040
 I think, like, think about it, I don't know.

43:13.040 --> 43:14.040
 What are your thoughts?

43:14.040 --> 43:18.720
 Like, if you think about our Earth, there's no structure we've built that intelligent

43:18.720 --> 43:20.680
 civilizations could see from far away.

43:20.680 --> 43:23.640
 There's literally nothing, not even the Great Wall of China.

43:23.640 --> 43:27.700
 And so to think, like, why would this other civilization build a giant structure that

43:27.700 --> 43:28.700
 we could see?

43:28.700 --> 43:33.760
 Yeah, so with SETI, the idea is that we're both trying to hear signals and send signals,

43:33.760 --> 43:34.760
 right?

43:34.760 --> 43:35.760
 Well, we haven't sent one.

43:35.760 --> 43:37.240
 They call that METI, messaging.

43:37.240 --> 43:42.880
 And there's a big kind of fear over METI, because do you want to tell them you're here?

43:42.880 --> 43:45.040
 It's kind of this, like, let's wait till they call us.

43:45.040 --> 43:46.040
 Yeah.

43:46.040 --> 43:51.960
 It's like a dating game, you have to, like, how many days do I wait before I call, kind

43:51.960 --> 43:52.960
 of thing.

43:52.960 --> 43:53.960
 Yeah.

43:53.960 --> 43:57.360
 But the funny thing is, if no one's sending us a message, if everybody's only listening,

43:57.360 --> 43:59.920
 how do you make progress?

43:59.920 --> 44:00.920
 That's right.

44:00.920 --> 44:04.960
 And, I mean, but there's also, there's the Voyager spacecraft that we have these little

44:04.960 --> 44:09.960
 pixels of robots flying out all over the place.

44:09.960 --> 44:13.320
 Some of them, like the Voyager, reach out really far.

44:13.320 --> 44:15.200
 And they have some stuff on them.

44:15.200 --> 44:16.200
 Okay, I just...

44:16.200 --> 44:19.160
 We do, we have the Voyager, but they're not really going anywhere in particular.

44:19.160 --> 44:21.960
 And they're moving very, very slowly on a cosmic scale.

44:21.960 --> 44:22.960
 Yeah.

44:22.960 --> 44:24.760
 And me saying they're far is kind of silly.

44:24.760 --> 44:25.760
 Yeah.

44:25.760 --> 44:26.760
 It's all relative in astronomy.

44:26.760 --> 44:27.760
 It's all relative.

44:27.760 --> 44:28.760
 Yeah.

44:28.760 --> 44:29.760
 Yeah.

44:29.760 --> 44:30.760
 I just...

44:30.760 --> 44:36.320
 So from the, if you look at Earth from an alien perspective, from visually and from

44:36.320 --> 44:44.880
 gas composition, I wonder if it's possible to determine the degree of maybe productive

44:44.880 --> 44:45.880
 energy use.

44:45.880 --> 44:51.240
 I wonder if it's possible to tell, like, how busy these Earthlings are.

44:51.240 --> 44:55.720
 Well, let's zoom out again and think about oxygen.

44:55.720 --> 45:00.200
 So when cyanobacteria arose like billions of years ago and figured out how to harness

45:00.200 --> 45:05.240
 the energy of the sun for photosynthesis, they reengineered the entire atmosphere.

45:05.240 --> 45:09.080
 20% of the atmosphere has oxygen now.

45:09.080 --> 45:11.040
 Like that is a huge scale.

45:11.040 --> 45:15.080
 You know, they almost poisoned everything else by making this, what was apparently very

45:15.080 --> 45:17.400
 poisonous to everything that was alive.

45:17.400 --> 45:18.400
 But imagine...

45:18.400 --> 45:19.400
 So are we doing anything at that scale?

45:19.400 --> 45:23.600
 Like, are we changing anything at like 20% of the Earth with a giant structure or 20%

45:23.600 --> 45:24.840
 of this or 20% of that?

45:24.840 --> 45:26.200
 Like we aren't actually.

45:26.200 --> 45:27.200
 Yeah.

45:27.200 --> 45:28.200
 Yeah.

45:28.200 --> 45:32.400
 That's humbling to think that we're not actually having that much of an impact.

45:32.400 --> 45:33.400
 I know.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.440
 But we are because in a way we're destroying our entire planet.

45:35.440 --> 45:40.520
 But it's humbling to think that from far away, people probably can't even tell.

45:40.520 --> 45:45.000
 But from the perspective of the planet, when we say we're destroying, you know, global

45:45.000 --> 45:51.320
 warming, all that kind of stuff, what we really mean is we're destroying it for a bunch of

45:51.320 --> 45:54.040
 different species, including humans.

45:54.040 --> 45:55.640
 But like, I think the Earth will be okay.

45:55.640 --> 46:00.840
 Oh, the Earth will be, the Earth will remain, whatever happens to us, the Earth will still

46:00.840 --> 46:01.840
 be here.

46:01.840 --> 46:03.800
 And it'll still be difficult to detect any difference.

46:03.800 --> 46:09.560
 Like it's sad to think that if humans destroy ourselves, except potentially with nuclear

46:09.560 --> 46:12.280
 war, it'd be hard to tell that anything even happened.

46:12.280 --> 46:13.280
 Yeah.

46:13.280 --> 46:15.800
 It's hard to tell from far away that anything happened.

46:15.800 --> 46:17.680
 What about, what are your thoughts now?

46:17.680 --> 46:21.760
 This is really getting into speculation land.

46:21.760 --> 46:28.220
 You've mentioned exoplanets were in the realm of, you know, this is beautiful edge between

46:28.220 --> 46:31.600
 science and science fiction.

46:31.600 --> 46:37.940
 That some of us, a rare few are brave enough to walk, I think in academia, you were brave

46:37.940 --> 46:39.880
 enough to do that.

46:39.880 --> 46:47.360
 I think in some sense, artificial intelligence sometimes walks that line a little bit.

46:47.360 --> 46:52.760
 There is so much excitement about extraterrestrial life and aliens in this world.

46:52.760 --> 46:59.600
 I mean, I don't know what, how to comprehend that excitement, but to me, it's great to

46:59.600 --> 47:06.800
 see people curious because to me, extraterrestrial life and aliens is at the core, a scientific

47:06.800 --> 47:08.400
 question.

47:08.400 --> 47:11.240
 And it's almost looks like people are excited about science.

47:11.240 --> 47:16.020
 They're excited by discovery, discovery, right?

47:16.020 --> 47:21.360
 And then the possibility that there's alien life that visited earth or is here on earth

47:21.360 --> 47:29.040
 now is, is a excitement about discovery in your lifetime, essentially.

47:29.040 --> 47:33.180
 I mean, what do you make, what do you make of that?

47:33.180 --> 47:44.280
 There's recent events where DARPA or DOD released footage of these unmanned aerial phenomena.

47:44.280 --> 47:46.240
 They're calling them now UAP.

47:46.240 --> 47:48.160
 They got everybody like super excited.

47:48.160 --> 47:52.220
 Like maybe there is like what, what, what's, what's here on earth.

47:52.220 --> 47:58.880
 Do you follow the, this world of people who are thinking about aliens that are already

47:58.880 --> 48:00.360
 here or have visited?

48:00.360 --> 48:01.360
 I don't really follow it.

48:01.360 --> 48:02.360
 They follow me.

48:02.360 --> 48:11.080
 Because in this field, if you're a scientist of any kind, you get, people contact us, me.

48:11.080 --> 48:15.680
 There's a lot of them about, Hey, I have stuff you should see, Hey, the aliens are already

48:15.680 --> 48:16.680
 here.

48:16.680 --> 48:17.680
 I need to tell you about it.

48:17.680 --> 48:22.640
 And I know there are people out there who really believe there's a psychology to it.

48:22.640 --> 48:25.800
 There's a psychology to it and it's fascinating, but okay.

48:25.800 --> 48:29.200
 So it's similar to artificial intelligence, but I still, but like you, I'm still enamored

48:29.200 --> 48:32.560
 with the point that it is out there and that people believe so strongly.

48:32.560 --> 48:37.600
 And that's so many people out there believe, believe.

48:37.600 --> 48:44.400
 And I don't know, I I'm not as allergic to it as some scientists are because ultimately

48:44.400 --> 48:50.360
 if aliens showed up or do show up or have showed up you know, these are going to be

48:50.360 --> 48:55.320
 very difficult to study scientific phenomena.

48:55.320 --> 49:01.320
 Like in, in fact, like going back to cats and dogs, like I just, I think we should be

49:01.320 --> 49:08.440
 more open minded about developing new tools and looking for intelligent life on earth

49:08.440 --> 49:10.360
 that we haven't yet found.

49:10.360 --> 49:15.160
 Or even understanding the nature of our own intelligence because it kind of is an alien

49:15.160 --> 49:19.040
 life form, the thing that's living, you know, in our skull.

49:19.040 --> 49:20.040
 It's so true.

49:20.040 --> 49:21.040
 And we don't understand consciousness.

49:21.040 --> 49:22.040
 Yeah.

49:22.040 --> 49:23.040
 It's true.

49:23.040 --> 49:28.480
 We don't understand how biology is hard, you know, unpacking it and working it all out.

49:28.480 --> 49:29.480
 It's a stretch.

49:29.480 --> 49:34.120
 And they say too that our thinking mind is like the tip of a pyramid and that everything

49:34.120 --> 49:37.640
 else is happening under the hood and, but what is happening?

49:37.640 --> 49:42.560
 But the thing with, so the typical scientist response to, you know, are there aliens here

49:42.560 --> 49:50.000
 is that we need to see major evidence, not like a sketchy picture of something.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.600
 We need some cold hard evidence and we just don't have that.

49:53.600 --> 49:54.600
 That's exactly right.

49:54.600 --> 49:55.600
 Yeah.

49:55.600 --> 50:00.080
 But from my perspective, I admire people that dream and I think that's beautiful.

50:00.080 --> 50:05.200
 The thing I don't like, there's two sides of the, of the folks that probably listened

50:05.200 --> 50:12.160
 to this, this podcast is, oh, those that dream, I think is beautiful, that, that wander what's

50:12.160 --> 50:14.140
 out there, what's here on earth.

50:14.140 --> 50:19.520
 And then the other ones who are very conspiratorial and thinking that stuff is being hidden and

50:19.520 --> 50:20.840
 it becomes about institutions.

50:20.840 --> 50:21.840
 Right, right, right.

50:21.840 --> 50:22.840
 Okay.

50:22.840 --> 50:23.840
 I got it.

50:23.840 --> 50:24.840
 I have a funny thing to talk about that.

50:24.840 --> 50:28.600
 So one of my colleagues had a really good answer to that and it's not me saying this,

50:28.600 --> 50:32.360
 so I can say this, but he said, look, he works with NASA, not at NASA.

50:32.360 --> 50:35.140
 He works with government, not in the government.

50:35.140 --> 50:37.640
 It's kind of mean, but he'd say, trust me, they couldn't hide it if they tried.

50:37.640 --> 50:39.640
 Do you know what I'm saying?

50:39.640 --> 50:42.360
 Like, we're not smart enough or good enough.

50:42.360 --> 50:45.280
 Not we or not me or not you, but whoever to cover it up.

50:45.280 --> 50:47.960
 It just, it's sort of a myth.

50:47.960 --> 50:48.960
 Yeah.

50:48.960 --> 50:57.040
 It makes it sad because the people at NASA, the people at MIT, the people in academia,

50:57.040 --> 51:03.560
 the people in these institutions and yes, even in government are often trying, they're

51:03.560 --> 51:06.280
 like just curious descendants of apes.

51:06.280 --> 51:08.800
 They're just, they, they want to do good.

51:08.800 --> 51:09.960
 They want to discover stuff.

51:09.960 --> 51:11.480
 They're not trying to hide stuff.

51:11.480 --> 51:18.520
 In fact, most of them would, in terms of leaks, would love to discover this and release this

51:18.520 --> 51:19.520
 kind of stuff.

51:19.520 --> 51:23.160
 There's a, did you ever watch the show called The X Files?

51:23.160 --> 51:24.160
 Yeah.

51:24.160 --> 51:25.160
 Scully and Mulder.

51:25.160 --> 51:26.160
 Yeah.

51:26.160 --> 51:29.920
 And what I love actually, I used to put it up during my talks, my public talks.

51:29.920 --> 51:35.360
 There's a picture of a UFO or what looks like UFO and it says, I want to believe.

51:35.360 --> 51:38.040
 So that's, that's where I think a lot of us are coming from.

51:38.040 --> 51:40.400
 I want to believe.

51:40.400 --> 51:41.400
 And it's so great.

51:41.400 --> 51:46.040
 And one time I put that up and this very, very nice couple approached me really nervous

51:46.040 --> 51:49.720
 afterwards and they said, Hey, can we take you out for lunch sometime?

51:49.720 --> 51:50.720
 And I said, sure.

51:50.720 --> 51:52.740
 And they were like the nicest people.

51:52.740 --> 51:59.000
 And just one of many who has an alien, alien abduction story and the woman, um, could never

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
 have kids.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.980
 They were older, but they didn't have kids, which for them was a real source of regret.

52:02.980 --> 52:06.560
 But it was because the aliens who had abducted her had made it so that she couldn't have

52:06.560 --> 52:07.560
 kids.

52:07.560 --> 52:12.280
 And she had apparently something implanted behind her ear, which was somehow unimplanted

52:12.280 --> 52:13.280
 later.

52:13.280 --> 52:18.480
 And they're just so sincere and they're such a lovely couple and they just wanted to share

52:18.480 --> 52:19.480
 their story.

52:19.480 --> 52:23.640
 That's a, that's a real, whatever that is, that's the real thing.

52:23.640 --> 52:30.720
 The mystery of the human mind is more powerful than any alien or, I mean, it's as interesting

52:30.720 --> 52:32.000
 I think as the universe.

52:32.000 --> 52:38.840
 And I think they're somehow intricately linked, maybe getting a sense of numbers.

52:38.840 --> 52:46.880
 How many stars are there in, um, maybe, I don't know what the radius that's reasonable

52:46.880 --> 52:47.880
 to think about.

52:47.880 --> 52:52.360
 I don't know if the observable universe is like way too big to think about, but in terms

52:52.360 --> 52:56.600
 of when we think about how many habitable planets there are, what are the numbers we're

52:56.600 --> 52:58.960
 working with in your sense?

52:58.960 --> 52:59.960
 What are the scale?

52:59.960 --> 53:03.760
 Honestly, the numbers are probably like billions of trillions of stars.

53:03.760 --> 53:04.760
 Yeah.

53:04.760 --> 53:07.720
 You know, in the UK, I think, I don't know if we do that here, but they will call a billion

53:07.720 --> 53:10.880
 trillion where you put like one billion followed by a trillion.

53:10.880 --> 53:11.880
 Yeah.

53:11.880 --> 53:14.960
 It's kind of weird, but here, I don't even know how to say the number 10 to the 20.

53:14.960 --> 53:17.600
 Like if you know what that is, that's one followed by 20 zeros.

53:17.600 --> 53:18.600
 That's a big number.

53:18.600 --> 53:20.220
 We don't have a name for that number.

53:20.220 --> 53:22.640
 There's so many per star.

53:22.640 --> 53:23.840
 I think we kind of mentioned this.

53:23.840 --> 53:30.320
 Is there a good sense, there's probably argument about this, but per star, how many planets

53:30.320 --> 53:31.320
 are there?

53:31.320 --> 53:35.640
 We don't have that number yet per se, you know, we're not really there, but some people

53:35.640 --> 53:38.240
 think that there's many planets per star.

53:38.240 --> 53:43.840
 There's this analogy of filling the coffee cup, like, you know, you don't usually just

53:43.840 --> 53:45.360
 pour one drop, you fill it.

53:45.360 --> 53:51.160
 And that planetary systems, we see stars being born that have a disc of gas and dust and

53:51.160 --> 53:53.280
 that ultimately forms planets.

53:53.280 --> 53:58.940
 So the idea, this kind of concept is that planets, so many planets form too many.

53:58.940 --> 54:02.680
 And eventually some get kicked out and you're left with like a full planetary system, a

54:02.680 --> 54:04.000
 dynamically full system.

54:04.000 --> 54:08.080
 And so there have to be a lot because so many form and a bunch survive.

54:08.080 --> 54:11.080
 I mean, that makes perfect intuitive sense, right?

54:11.080 --> 54:12.880
 Like why wouldn't that happen?

54:12.880 --> 54:13.880
 Right.

54:13.880 --> 54:16.340
 Well, there's other thoughts too, though.

54:16.340 --> 54:20.720
 These big planets that are really close to the star, we think they formed far away from

54:20.720 --> 54:25.220
 the star where there's enough material to form and they migrated inwards.

54:25.220 --> 54:28.600
 And some of these planets migrating inwards due to interaction with other planets or with

54:28.600 --> 54:32.120
 the disc itself, they may have cleared it out.

54:32.120 --> 54:34.700
 And kicked other planets out of the system.

54:34.700 --> 54:36.540
 So there's a lot of ideas floating around.

54:36.540 --> 54:39.120
 We're not entirely sure.

54:39.120 --> 54:41.440
 And what about Earth like planets?

54:41.440 --> 54:43.680
 That's another level of uncertainty.

54:43.680 --> 54:44.760
 It's a level of uncertainty.

54:44.760 --> 54:51.440
 If we think of an Earth like planet being an Earth around a sun in the same orbit, an

54:51.440 --> 54:55.800
 Earth like planet being an Earth sized planet in an Earth like orbit about a sun like star,

54:55.800 --> 54:56.800
 we're not there yet.

54:56.800 --> 55:00.760
 You know, we're not able to detect enough of those to give you a hard number.

55:00.760 --> 55:03.080
 Some people have extrapolated.

55:03.080 --> 55:08.560
 And they will say as many as one in five stars like our sun could be hosting a true Earth

55:08.560 --> 55:09.560
 like planet.

55:09.560 --> 55:10.560
 Wow.

55:10.560 --> 55:15.280
 On the topic of space exploration, there's been a lot of exciting developments with NASA,

55:15.280 --> 55:23.680
 with SpaceX, with other companies successfully getting rockets into space with humans and

55:23.680 --> 55:27.920
 getting them to land back, especially with SpaceX.

55:27.920 --> 55:33.920
 What are your thoughts about Elon Musk and SpaceX, Crew Dragon, while working with NASA

55:33.920 --> 55:35.680
 to launch astronauts?

55:35.680 --> 55:39.720
 What's your sense about these exciting new developments?

55:39.720 --> 55:46.200
 Well, SpaceX and other so called commercial companies are only good news for my field,

55:46.200 --> 55:50.600
 because they're lowering the cost of getting to space by having reusable rockets.

55:50.600 --> 55:52.200
 It's just been it's incredible.

55:52.200 --> 55:53.840
 And we need cheaper access to space.

55:53.840 --> 55:56.760
 So from a very practical viewpoint, it's all good.

55:56.760 --> 56:01.520
 Without getting people, there's this dream that we have to go to Mars, boots on Mars.

56:01.520 --> 56:03.960
 Boots on Mars.

56:03.960 --> 56:04.960
 What do you think about that?

56:04.960 --> 56:06.080
 You mentioned probes.

56:06.080 --> 56:08.560
 What's the value of humans?

56:08.560 --> 56:13.880
 Is that interesting to you from both scientific and a human perspective?

56:13.880 --> 56:14.880
 Human mostly.

56:14.880 --> 56:19.400
 I think it's such in our desire to explore because part of what it means to be human.

56:19.400 --> 56:23.440
 So wanting to go to another planet and be able to live there for some time.

56:23.440 --> 56:26.520
 It's just just what it means to be human.

56:26.520 --> 56:32.160
 You know, oftentimes in science and engineering, big, huge discoveries are made when we didn't

56:32.160 --> 56:33.680
 intend to.

56:33.680 --> 56:37.720
 So often this kind of pure exploratory type of research or this pure exploration research,

56:37.720 --> 56:41.060
 it can lead to something really important like the laser, we couldn't really live without

56:41.060 --> 56:42.060
 that now.

56:42.060 --> 56:46.860
 At the grocery, you scan your foods, there's surgery that involves lasers, GPS, we all

56:46.860 --> 56:47.860
 use our GPS.

56:47.860 --> 56:53.120
 We don't have GPS because someone thought, hey, it'd be great to have a navigation system.

56:53.120 --> 56:58.480
 And so I do support, I do, I just, but I really think it comes primarily just from the desire

56:58.480 --> 56:59.480
 to explore.

56:59.480 --> 57:06.380
 Do you think something, there's a lot of criticism and a lot of excitement about Mars.

57:06.380 --> 57:12.880
 Do you think there's value in trying to go to put humans on Mars, first of all, and second

57:12.880 --> 57:15.680
 of all, colonize Mars?

57:15.680 --> 57:18.920
 Do you think there's something interesting that might come from there?

57:18.920 --> 57:20.680
 I'm convinced there will be something interesting.

57:20.680 --> 57:24.880
 I just don't know what it is yet, but I don't think, I don't think having some commercial

57:24.880 --> 57:29.480
 value or value in the metric of something useful is really what's motivating us.

57:29.480 --> 57:33.640
 So really, you see, exploration is a long term investment into something awesome that

57:33.640 --> 57:35.560
 eventually will be commercial value.

57:35.560 --> 57:36.560
 I do actually.

57:36.560 --> 57:37.560
 Yeah.

57:37.560 --> 57:38.560
 I do.

57:38.560 --> 57:48.640
 So what about visiting, okay, I apologize, but Amy, there's an exciting longing to visit

57:48.640 --> 57:51.140
 Earth like planets elsewhere.

57:51.140 --> 57:59.200
 So what's the closest Earth like planet you think is worth visiting and how hard is it?

57:59.200 --> 58:01.560
 Wow, it is very hard.

58:01.560 --> 58:05.640
 I mean, our nearest, call it Earth mass planet, it's orbiting a star very different from

58:05.640 --> 58:10.460
 our own sun, an M Dwarf star, a small red star, Proxima Centauri.

58:10.460 --> 58:15.340
 It's over four light years away and we can't travel at the speed of light.

58:15.340 --> 58:18.640
 We can't even travel, I mean, it would take tens of thousands of years to get there with

58:18.640 --> 58:19.640
 conventional methods.

58:19.640 --> 58:23.920
 So, you know, the movies like multigenerational, yeah, this movie Passenger, have you seen

58:23.920 --> 58:24.920
 that movie?

58:24.920 --> 58:25.920
 Passenger.

58:25.920 --> 58:26.920
 No.

58:26.920 --> 58:30.400
 It's about a big spaceship that is traveling to another planet and everyone's hibernating.

58:30.400 --> 58:33.320
 I won't give you the spoiler alert because one person wakes up and then it's kind of

58:33.320 --> 58:34.320
 a problem.

58:34.320 --> 58:35.320
 Okay, got it.

58:35.320 --> 58:40.940
 But yeah, the multigenerational ships, I mean, when you think about where we're headed as

58:40.940 --> 58:48.200
 a species, maybe we don't send people, maybe we end up sending raw biological materials

58:48.200 --> 58:54.640
 and instructions to print out humans, it sounds kind of farfetched, but already we're printing

58:54.640 --> 59:01.360
 like liver cells in the lab and beating heart cells, we're starting to reconstruct body

59:01.360 --> 59:02.360
 parts.

59:02.360 --> 59:06.080
 I mean, the thing is, it is so hard to get to another planet that this thought of printing

59:06.080 --> 59:09.080
 humans or printing life forms actually could be easier.

59:09.080 --> 59:16.680
 Yeah, that's somehow so sad to think, to think of the idea that we would launch a successful

59:16.680 --> 59:23.520
 spaceship that has multigenerational, like non human life and it's going to reach other

59:23.520 --> 59:30.120
 intelligent life and by the time they figure out where it came from, human civilization

59:30.120 --> 59:31.120
 will be extinct.

59:31.120 --> 59:32.120
 Wow.

59:32.120 --> 59:36.480
 Yeah, that is really, I mean, that's, so that's one, there's a, there's a tempting thing to

59:36.480 --> 59:37.480
 think about.

59:37.480 --> 59:38.480
 What are the possible trajectories?

59:38.480 --> 59:47.040
 So, you know, Elon keeps talking about multi planetary, us becoming multi planetary species.

59:47.040 --> 59:55.000
 I mean, sure, Mars is a part of that, but like the dream is to really expand outside

59:55.000 --> 59:57.080
 the solar system.

59:57.080 --> 1:00:02.240
 And it's, it's not clear, just like, as you said, like what the actual scientific engineering

1:00:02.240 --> 1:00:08.420
 steps that are required to take, it seems like so daunting, so daunting.

1:00:08.420 --> 1:00:15.360
 So like this, the smart thing seems to be to do the most achievable near daunting task,

1:00:15.360 --> 1:00:20.680
 even if there doesn't seem to be a commercial application, which I think is colonizing

1:00:20.680 --> 1:00:21.680
 Mars.

1:00:21.680 --> 1:00:30.600
 But like from your perspective, is there some Manhattan project style, huge project in space

1:00:30.600 --> 1:00:34.920
 that we might want to take on and you've had roles.

1:00:34.920 --> 1:00:39.600
 You had scientists hat roles and then you also had roles in terms of being on like committees

1:00:39.600 --> 1:00:42.680
 and stuff, determining where funding goes and so on.

1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:48.840
 So like, is there a huge like multi trillion, we've been throwing the T word around recently

1:00:48.840 --> 1:00:52.200
 a lot, but these huge projects that we might want to take on?

1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:56.220
 Well, first of all, we want to find the planets like earth first, like just even finding those

1:00:56.220 --> 1:01:01.200
 earth like planets is a billion dollar endeavor, billions of dollars endeavor.

1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:06.560
 And that's so hard because an earth is so small, so less massive, and so faint compared

1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:08.100
 to our sun.

1:01:08.100 --> 1:01:10.920
 It's the proverbial needle in a haystack, but worse.

1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:15.560
 And we need very sophisticated space based telescopes to be able to find these planets

1:01:15.560 --> 1:01:19.800
 and to look, look at them and see which ones have water and which ones have signs of life

1:01:19.800 --> 1:01:20.800
 on them.

1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:24.720
 Yeah, the, the star shade project that you're part of, star shade, star shade, yeah, this

1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:26.680
 is probably the most badass thing I've ever seen.

1:01:26.680 --> 1:01:27.680
 Right.

1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:28.680
 You know what's interesting?

1:01:28.680 --> 1:01:29.680
 Can you describe what it is?

1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:34.920
 So what's amazing about star shade is it was first conceived of in the 1960s.

1:01:34.920 --> 1:01:38.640
 Imagine that and revisited every decade until now when we think we can actually build it

1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:42.880
 and star shade is a giant specially shaped screen.

1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:47.120
 It is about, there's different versions of it, but think about 30 meters in diameter.

1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:49.700
 So you're blocking out the sun.

1:01:49.700 --> 1:01:54.240
 You're effectively blocking out the star so that you can see the planet directly and star

1:01:54.240 --> 1:01:58.800
 shade would have a spacecraft attached to it and it would fly in space far away from

1:01:58.800 --> 1:02:03.660
 Earth's gravity and it would have to formation fly with a space telescope.

1:02:03.660 --> 1:02:08.200
 So the idea is that star shade blocks out the starlight in a very careful way and it

1:02:08.200 --> 1:02:13.360
 has to block that starlight out so that the planet that is 10 billion times fainter than

1:02:13.360 --> 1:02:17.640
 the star, that only the planet light goes to the telescope.

1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:19.020
 Yeah.

1:02:19.020 --> 1:02:24.840
 So in formation, meaning the telescope flies in, you gave a presentation on this, but like

1:02:24.840 --> 1:02:30.960
 it, it would fly like in, um, this is extremely high precision endeavor.

1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:31.960
 Yeah.

1:02:31.960 --> 1:02:37.040
 We had this analogy like asking a friend to hold up a dime five miles away perfectly.

1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:40.460
 Like at the perfect line of sight with you.

1:02:40.460 --> 1:02:41.720
 And the shape of it is pretty cool.

1:02:41.720 --> 1:02:45.780
 I mean, uh, I don't know exactly what the physics of that, like what the optics are

1:02:45.780 --> 1:02:47.240
 that require that shape.

1:02:47.240 --> 1:02:51.280
 I can tell you, it turns out that if you block out a star, imagine blocking out a star with

1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:57.240
 a circle circularly or a square shaped screen, you wouldn't actually be blocking it because

1:02:57.240 --> 1:02:58.840
 the star acts like a wave.

1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:03.840
 The starlight can act like a wave and it would actually bend around the edges of the screen.

1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:06.360
 And so instead of blocking out the light, you're expecting to see nothing.

1:03:06.360 --> 1:03:11.120
 You would see ripples and the analogy that I love to give, it's like throwing a pebble

1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:12.120
 in a pond.

1:03:12.120 --> 1:03:16.480
 You know, you get those ripples, you get these concentric ripples and they go out and light

1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:18.640
 would do something quite similar.

1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:23.800
 You'd actually see ripples of light and those ripples of light, they're actually way brighter

1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:26.380
 than the planet we'd be looking for.

1:03:26.380 --> 1:03:29.360
 So they would introduce this noise that's a noise.

1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:33.900
 And so the star shade, it's like a mathematical solution to the problem of diffraction it's

1:03:33.900 --> 1:03:35.240
 called.

1:03:35.240 --> 1:03:39.820
 And this is what the first person who thought about star shape in the 1960s worked out the

1:03:39.820 --> 1:03:43.860
 mathematical shape or one salute, one family of solutions.

1:03:43.860 --> 1:03:48.320
 And the idea is that when the star shade, this very special shape, like a giant flower

1:03:48.320 --> 1:03:53.680
 with petals, when it blocks out the light, the light bends around the edges, but interacts

1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:57.220
 with itself in a way to give you a very, very dark image.

1:03:57.220 --> 1:04:02.240
 It would be like throwing a pebble in a pond and instead of getting ripples, the pond would

1:04:02.240 --> 1:04:06.760
 be perfectly smooth, like incredibly smooth to one part in 10 billion.

1:04:06.760 --> 1:04:11.980
 And all the waves would be on the outer edges, far away from where you drop that pebble.

1:04:11.980 --> 1:04:19.640
 And so this camera would be able to get some signal from the planet then.

1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:22.020
 Yes, and it would be hard because the planet is so faint.

1:04:22.020 --> 1:04:25.840
 But with the star out of the way, the glare of that bright, bright, bright star, with

1:04:25.840 --> 1:04:30.500
 that out of the way, then it becomes a much more manageable task.

1:04:30.500 --> 1:04:32.520
 So how do we get that thing out there?

1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:34.040
 We're working with unlimited money.

1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:35.800
 Okay, we're working with unlimited money.

1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:39.160
 We have some more engineering problems to solve, but not too many more.

1:04:39.160 --> 1:04:43.000
 We've been burning down our so called tall pole list.

1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:44.000
 What kind of list?

1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:47.360
 We call it technology tall pole.

1:04:47.360 --> 1:04:51.860
 It's the phrase where you have to figure out what are your hardest problems and then break

1:04:51.860 --> 1:04:53.080
 those down to solve.

1:04:53.080 --> 1:04:57.760
 So the star shade, one of the really hard problems was how to formation fly at tens

1:04:57.760 --> 1:04:59.800
 of thousands of kilometers.

1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:02.120
 It's like, wow, that is insane.

1:05:02.120 --> 1:05:06.760
 And the team broke that down actually into a sensing problem because of the star shade.

1:05:06.760 --> 1:05:10.200
 How do you see the star shade precisely enough to control it?

1:05:10.200 --> 1:05:13.720
 Because if you're shining a flashlight, you know the beam spreads out.

1:05:13.720 --> 1:05:17.800
 So the star shade has a beacon, an LED or a laser, it's going to spread out so much

1:05:17.800 --> 1:05:19.940
 by the time it gets to the telescope.

1:05:19.940 --> 1:05:23.240
 The problem wasn't how do you tell the star shade how to move around fast enough to stay

1:05:23.240 --> 1:05:24.560
 in a straight line.

1:05:24.560 --> 1:05:27.720
 The problem was how are you able to sense it well enough?

1:05:27.720 --> 1:05:32.540
 So problems like that were broken down and money that came from NASA to solve problems

1:05:32.540 --> 1:05:34.460
 is put towards solving it.

1:05:34.460 --> 1:05:37.020
 So we've got through most of the hard problems right now.

1:05:37.020 --> 1:05:41.500
 Another one was that star shade, even though it's looking at a star, light from our own

1:05:41.500 --> 1:05:46.880
 sun could hit the edges of the star shade and bounce off into the telescope, believe

1:05:46.880 --> 1:05:48.720
 it or not.

1:05:48.720 --> 1:05:52.960
 And that would actually ruin it because we're trying to see this tiny, tiny signal.

1:05:52.960 --> 1:05:55.760
 So then the question is how do you make a razor thin edge?

1:05:55.760 --> 1:05:58.640
 Those pedal edges would have to be like a razor.

1:05:58.640 --> 1:05:59.640
 What materials can you use?

1:05:59.640 --> 1:06:01.640
 So there's a series of problems like that.

1:06:01.640 --> 1:06:02.640
 Wow.

1:06:02.640 --> 1:06:03.880
 So there's a materials problem in there?

1:06:03.880 --> 1:06:04.880
 Some of them.

1:06:04.880 --> 1:06:05.880
 Mm hmm.

1:06:05.880 --> 1:06:06.880
 Wow.

1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:07.880
 And there's one.

1:06:07.880 --> 1:06:12.820
 So we almost finished solving all those problems and then it's just a matter of building one

1:06:12.820 --> 1:06:18.060
 and testing it in a full scale size facility and then building the telescope.

1:06:18.060 --> 1:06:22.220
 It's just a matter of time to build everything and get it, get it up for launch.

1:06:22.220 --> 1:06:26.520
 So this is an engineering close engineering project.

1:06:26.520 --> 1:06:28.240
 It's a real engineering project.

1:06:28.240 --> 1:06:32.320
 I actually can tell you about two other projects that are not mine.

1:06:32.320 --> 1:06:38.900
 I like to call, call star shade mine because it was my project that I helped make it mainstream

1:06:38.900 --> 1:06:40.840
 without line is constantly shifting.

1:06:40.840 --> 1:06:44.480
 When I started, when I got this leadership role on star shade, I remember telling people

1:06:44.480 --> 1:06:47.860
 about it and it was definitely not on the mainstream okay line.

1:06:47.860 --> 1:06:52.420
 It was on the giggle factor side of the line and people would just laugh like that's dead.

1:06:52.420 --> 1:06:55.800
 Like you can never formation fly or they'd say, why are you working on that?

1:06:55.800 --> 1:06:58.280
 That's just so not, it's not so awesome.

1:06:58.280 --> 1:07:01.820
 There's a, there's a few things you've done in your life and that's when I first saw star

1:07:01.820 --> 1:07:04.700
 shade, I was like, what, really?

1:07:04.700 --> 1:07:07.060
 And then like it sinks in.

1:07:07.060 --> 1:07:11.940
 I mean, it's the same thing I felt with like Elon Musk or certain people who do crazy stuff

1:07:11.940 --> 1:07:15.820
 and like, and then, and they get, they actually make it work.

1:07:15.820 --> 1:07:22.860
 I mean, if you get star shade information flying to like together, I mean, how awesome

1:07:22.860 --> 1:07:27.520
 is that if you actually make that happen, even like from a robot, I'm sorry, from the

1:07:27.520 --> 1:07:31.600
 robotics perspective, even if it doesn't give us good data, that's just like a cool

1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:33.180
 thing to get out there.

1:07:33.180 --> 1:07:34.600
 I mean, it's really exciting.

1:07:34.600 --> 1:07:35.600
 Really cool.

1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:39.340
 So there's two other topics that aren't mine, but I still love them.

1:07:39.340 --> 1:07:43.160
 One of them, let's just talk about it briefly because it's not a probe, but it's the idea

1:07:43.160 --> 1:07:47.820
 to send a telescope very far away to 500 times the earth sun distance.

1:07:47.820 --> 1:07:51.160
 And this is way farther than the Voyager spacecrafts are right now.

1:07:51.160 --> 1:07:56.740
 And to use our sun as a gravitational lens, to use our sun to magnify something that's

1:07:56.740 --> 1:07:59.200
 behind it.

1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:00.980
 It's got to sink in for a minute.

1:08:00.980 --> 1:08:01.980
 Exactly.

1:08:01.980 --> 1:08:05.400
 But I mean, I don't know what the physics of that is, like how to use the sun.

1:08:05.400 --> 1:08:11.000
 In astronomy, and Einstein thought about this initially, we can use a massive objects, bend

1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:12.120
 space.

1:08:12.120 --> 1:08:16.900
 And so light that should be traveling like straight, it actually travels around the warped

1:08:16.900 --> 1:08:18.440
 space.

1:08:18.440 --> 1:08:23.060
 And somehow you figure out a way to use that for magnification.

1:08:23.060 --> 1:08:25.220
 You have a way to use that for magnification.

1:08:25.220 --> 1:08:26.220
 That's right.

1:08:26.220 --> 1:08:33.060
 There are galaxies that are lensed, so called gravitational lens by intervening galaxy clusters

1:08:33.060 --> 1:08:34.660
 actually.

1:08:34.660 --> 1:08:40.740
 And there are microlensing events where stars get magnified as an unseen gravitational lens

1:08:40.740 --> 1:08:43.600
 star passes in between us and that very distant star.

1:08:43.600 --> 1:08:45.540
 It's actually a real tool in astronomy.

1:08:45.540 --> 1:08:49.940
 Yeah, using gravitational lensing to magnify because it bends more rays towards you than

1:08:49.940 --> 1:08:52.060
 normally you'd normally see.

1:08:52.060 --> 1:08:58.740
 And again, we're trying to get more higher resolution images that are basically boiled

1:08:58.740 --> 1:08:59.740
 down to light.

1:08:59.740 --> 1:09:01.700
 Well, it boils down to light.

1:09:01.700 --> 1:09:04.780
 And then you can maybe get more information about.

1:09:04.780 --> 1:09:10.500
 Well, in this case, you would ask me, let's say, if this thing could get built, it would

1:09:10.500 --> 1:09:15.780
 take like something like they like to say 25 years to get from here to there, 25 years

1:09:15.780 --> 1:09:18.300
 and then it could send some information back to us.

1:09:18.300 --> 1:09:20.540
 And then you'd say, so Sarah, how many pixels?

1:09:20.540 --> 1:09:21.900
 And I wouldn't say one or less than one.

1:09:21.900 --> 1:09:26.300
 I'd say, you know, it could be like 10 by 10 pixels, it could be 100 pixels, which would

1:09:26.300 --> 1:09:27.300
 be awesome.

1:09:27.300 --> 1:09:30.500
 I mean, that's still crazy that we can get a lot of information from that.

1:09:30.500 --> 1:09:31.500
 Crazy, right.

1:09:31.500 --> 1:09:34.340
 And it's crazy for a lot of other reasons, because again, you have to line up the sun

1:09:34.340 --> 1:09:35.340
 and your target.

1:09:35.340 --> 1:09:39.980
 You'd only have one telescope per target, because every star is behind the sun in a

1:09:39.980 --> 1:09:42.460
 different way.

1:09:42.460 --> 1:09:43.980
 So it's a lot of complicated things.

1:09:43.980 --> 1:09:44.980
 What about the second?

1:09:44.980 --> 1:09:48.580
 The second one, it's called star shot.

1:09:48.580 --> 1:09:53.540
 You know, star shot means like big dreams and it's an initiative by the Breakthrough

1:09:53.540 --> 1:09:55.740
 Foundation.

1:09:55.740 --> 1:10:02.700
 And star shot is the concept to send thousands of little tiny spacecraft, which they now

1:10:02.700 --> 1:10:03.700
 call star chip.

1:10:03.700 --> 1:10:06.580
 So instead of star ship, it's star chip.

1:10:06.580 --> 1:10:13.520
 And there's a little chip and the star chip, so like sending like thousands of little turtles

1:10:13.520 --> 1:10:15.100
 being born, they're not all going to make it.

1:10:15.100 --> 1:10:20.700
 The idea is to send lots of them, and each of these star chips, once they're launched

1:10:20.700 --> 1:10:26.420
 into, I guess, low Earth orbit, they will deploy a solar sail that's a few meters in

1:10:26.420 --> 1:10:27.940
 diameter.

1:10:27.940 --> 1:10:34.040
 And the idea is that on Earth, we would have a bank of, this one is still a bit on the

1:10:34.040 --> 1:10:40.420
 other side of the line, but we'd have a bank of telescopes with lasers that would be like

1:10:40.420 --> 1:10:48.660
 a gigawatt power and these lasers would momentarily shine upwards and accelerate, they'd hit these

1:10:48.660 --> 1:10:49.660
 sails.

1:10:49.660 --> 1:10:54.500
 They'd be like a power source for the sail and would accelerate the sails to travel at

1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:57.700
 about a 20th the speed of light.

1:10:57.700 --> 1:10:59.940
 Is that as crazy as it sounds?

1:10:59.940 --> 1:11:05.720
 Well, like any good engineering project, it has to be broken down into the crazy parts.

1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:11.500
 And the Breakthrough Initiative, like to their huge credit, is sponsoring, you know, getting

1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:16.260
 over these, actually, they've listed initially, they listed 19 challenges, so it's broken

1:11:16.260 --> 1:11:17.940
 down to concrete things.

1:11:17.940 --> 1:11:21.340
 Like one of them is, well, you have to buy the land and make sure the airspace is okay

1:11:21.340 --> 1:11:24.980
 with you sending up that much power overhead.

1:11:24.980 --> 1:11:29.100
 Another one is you have to have material on the sail where the lasers won't just vaporize

1:11:29.100 --> 1:11:30.100
 it.

1:11:30.100 --> 1:11:33.580
 So there's a lot of issues, but anyway, these sails would be accelerated to 20th the speed

1:11:33.580 --> 1:11:38.460
 of light and their journey to the nearest star would no longer be tens of thousands

1:11:38.460 --> 1:11:45.860
 of years, but could be 20 years, okay, 20, so it's not as bad as tens of thousands.

1:11:45.860 --> 1:11:52.060
 And these thousands or whatever, however many make it, they'll go by the nearest star system

1:11:52.060 --> 1:11:57.220
 and snap some images and radio the information back to Earth because they're traveling so

1:11:57.220 --> 1:12:01.340
 fast they can't slow down, but they'll zoom by, take some photos, send it back.

1:12:01.340 --> 1:12:02.340
 Hi, Rez.

1:12:02.340 --> 1:12:06.180
 See, just what I want you to pause on for a second is that just by making that a real

1:12:06.180 --> 1:12:11.220
 concept and the money given won't make it happen, but what it's done is it's planted

1:12:11.220 --> 1:12:15.980
 the seed and it's shifted that line from what is crazy to what is a real project.

1:12:15.980 --> 1:12:20.020
 It's shifted it just ever so slightly enough, I think, to plant the seed that we have to

1:12:20.020 --> 1:12:23.300
 find a way to somehow find a way to get there.

1:12:23.300 --> 1:12:26.380
 That is, again, to stay on that, that is so powerful.

1:12:26.380 --> 1:12:34.620
 Make a big, crazy idea and break it down into smaller, crazy ideas, order it in a list,

1:12:34.620 --> 1:12:38.820
 and knock it out one at a time.

1:12:38.820 --> 1:12:43.260
 I don't know, I've never heard anything more inspiring from an engineering perspective

1:12:43.260 --> 1:12:46.060
 because that's how you solve the impossible things.

1:12:46.060 --> 1:12:55.300
 So you open your new book discussing Rogue Planet, PSO, J318, I never said this out loud,

1:12:55.300 --> 1:13:03.180
 PSO 1.522, so a Rogue Planet, which is just this poetic, beautiful vision of a planet

1:13:03.180 --> 1:13:10.780
 that, as you write, lurches across the galaxy like a rudderless ship wrapped in perpetual

1:13:10.780 --> 1:13:18.500
 darkness, its surface swept by constant storms, its black skies raining molten iron.

1:13:18.500 --> 1:13:27.340
 Just like the vision of that, the scary, the darkness, just how not pleasant it is for

1:13:27.340 --> 1:13:32.900
 human life, just the intensity of that metaphor, I don't know.

1:13:32.900 --> 1:13:43.700
 And the reason you use that is to paint in a feeling of loneliness, I think, and despair.

1:13:43.700 --> 1:13:53.860
 And why, maybe on the planet side, why does it feel, maybe it's just me, why does it feel

1:13:53.860 --> 1:13:57.860
 so profoundly lonely on that kind of planet?

1:13:57.860 --> 1:13:59.420
 Like what...

1:13:59.420 --> 1:14:06.260
 I think it's because we all want to be a part of something, a part of a family, or a part

1:14:06.260 --> 1:14:10.540
 of a community, or a part of something.

1:14:10.540 --> 1:14:16.980
 And so, our solar system, and by the way, I only, it's sort of like when you treat yourself

1:14:16.980 --> 1:14:21.980
 to like eating an entire tub of ice cream, like I sometimes treat myself to imagine things

1:14:21.980 --> 1:14:25.140
 like this and not just be so cut and dried.

1:14:25.140 --> 1:14:28.380
 But when you imagine that, this planet's not part, because I don't want to give emotions

1:14:28.380 --> 1:14:31.460
 to a planet per se, but the planet's not part of anything.

1:14:31.460 --> 1:14:37.140
 It's somehow, it's just all on its own, just kind of out there without that warm energy

1:14:37.140 --> 1:14:40.980
 from its sun, it's just all alone out there.

1:14:40.980 --> 1:14:45.980
 To me, it was this little discovery that I actually feel pretty good being part of this

1:14:45.980 --> 1:14:47.580
 solar system.

1:14:47.580 --> 1:14:52.540
 It felt like we have a sun, we have like a little family, and it felt like it sucked

1:14:52.540 --> 1:14:59.900
 for the rogue planet to just floating about, not floating, flying rudderless.

1:14:59.900 --> 1:15:04.620
 By the way, how many rogue planets are there in your sense?

1:15:04.620 --> 1:15:05.620
 We don't know totally.

1:15:05.620 --> 1:15:08.540
 I mean, there's some rogue planets that are just born on their own.

1:15:08.540 --> 1:15:11.900
 I know that sounds really weird to be, how can you be born an orphan?

1:15:11.900 --> 1:15:17.660
 But they just are, because most planets are born out of a disc of gas and dust around

1:15:17.660 --> 1:15:18.660
 a star.

1:15:18.660 --> 1:15:21.580
 But some of these small planets are like totally failed stars.

1:15:21.580 --> 1:15:24.580
 They're so failed, they're just small planets on their own.

1:15:24.580 --> 1:15:29.060
 But we think that there's probably, honestly, there's another path to a rogue planet.

1:15:29.060 --> 1:15:33.060
 That's one that's been kicked out of its star system by other planets, like a game of billiard

1:15:33.060 --> 1:15:34.060
 balls.

1:15:34.060 --> 1:15:35.660
 It just gets kicked out.

1:15:35.660 --> 1:15:39.780
 We actually think there's probably as many rogue planets as stars.

1:15:39.780 --> 1:15:44.620
 No flying out there, fundamentally alone.

1:15:44.620 --> 1:15:56.740
 So the book is a memoir, is about your life, and it weaves both your fascination with planets

1:15:56.740 --> 1:16:05.780
 outside the solar system and the path of your life, and you lost your husband, which is

1:16:05.780 --> 1:16:15.620
 a kind of central part of the book that created a feeling of the rogue planet.

1:16:15.620 --> 1:16:17.380
 By the way, what's the name of the book?

1:16:17.380 --> 1:16:21.740
 The name of the book is The Smallest Lights in the Universe.

1:16:21.740 --> 1:16:22.740
 What's up with the title?

1:16:22.740 --> 1:16:23.740
 What's the meaning?

1:16:23.740 --> 1:16:25.100
 The title has a double meaning.

1:16:25.100 --> 1:16:27.700
 On the face of it, it's the search for other Earths.

1:16:27.700 --> 1:16:32.900
 Earths are so dim compared to the big, bright, massive star beside them.

1:16:32.900 --> 1:16:38.700
 Searching for the Earths is like searching for the smallest lights in the universe.

1:16:38.700 --> 1:16:42.300
 It has this other meaning, too.

1:16:42.300 --> 1:16:49.060
 I really hope that you or the other people listening never get to the place where you've

1:16:49.060 --> 1:16:56.500
 fallen off the cliff into this horrible place of huge despair.

1:16:56.500 --> 1:17:01.060
 And once in a while, you get a glimmer of a better life, of some kind of hope.

1:17:01.060 --> 1:17:03.420
 And those are also the smallest lights in the universe.

1:17:03.420 --> 1:17:11.720
 Well, maybe we can tell the full story before we talk about the glimmer of hope.

1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:17.620
 What did it feel like to first find out that your husband, Mike, was sick?

1:17:17.620 --> 1:17:19.540
 It was incredibly frustrating.

1:17:19.540 --> 1:17:25.100
 Like, lots of us have had some kind of problem that the doctors completely ignore.

1:17:25.100 --> 1:17:27.340
 Just that they kept blowing him off.

1:17:27.340 --> 1:17:28.340
 It's nothing.

1:17:28.340 --> 1:17:30.740
 Are they paid to just say it's nothing?

1:17:30.740 --> 1:17:32.060
 I mean, it's just insane.

1:17:32.060 --> 1:17:34.580
 I was just so angry.

1:17:34.580 --> 1:17:37.140
 And we finally got to a point where he was really sick.

1:17:37.140 --> 1:17:41.680
 He was like in bed, not able to move, basically.

1:17:41.680 --> 1:17:47.460
 And it turned out all the things they ignored and not done any tests, he had like a 100%

1:17:47.460 --> 1:17:48.940
 blockage in his intestine.

1:17:48.940 --> 1:17:49.940
 Like 100%.

1:17:49.940 --> 1:17:53.900
 Like nothing could get out, nothing could get in.

1:17:53.900 --> 1:17:58.580
 And it was pretty, pretty shocking to even hear then that it could be nothing.

1:17:58.580 --> 1:18:03.140
 What was the progression of it in the context of the maybe the medical system, the doctors?

1:18:03.140 --> 1:18:05.340
 I mean, what did it feel like?

1:18:05.340 --> 1:18:08.940
 Did you feel like a human being?

1:18:08.940 --> 1:18:11.180
 I felt like a child.

1:18:11.180 --> 1:18:19.260
 Like the doctors were trying to water down the real diagnosis or treat us like we couldn't

1:18:19.260 --> 1:18:21.060
 know the truth or they didn't know.

1:18:21.060 --> 1:18:24.920
 You know, I felt mixed like, it's not a good situation if you think the doctor either has

1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:29.780
 no idea what he or she is doing, or if the doctors purposely, let's just say lying to

1:18:29.780 --> 1:18:30.780
 you to sugarcoat it.

1:18:30.780 --> 1:18:34.140
 Like, I didn't know which one of it was, but I knew it was one of those.

1:18:34.140 --> 1:18:37.660
 What were the things he was suffering from?

1:18:37.660 --> 1:18:39.860
 Well, initially, he just had a random stomach ache.

1:18:39.860 --> 1:18:43.380
 I hate to say that out loud because I know a lot of people will have a random stomach

1:18:43.380 --> 1:18:44.380
 ache.

1:18:44.380 --> 1:18:47.420
 But so he just had a bad stomach ache and then, hmm, this is weird.

1:18:47.420 --> 1:18:50.420
 A few days later, another bad stomach ache, kind of gets worse.

1:18:50.420 --> 1:18:52.940
 Might go away for a few weeks, might come back.

1:18:52.940 --> 1:18:56.700
 And at the time, all I knew was my dad had had that same thing.

1:18:56.700 --> 1:19:01.820
 Not the same identical system, but he had these really weird pains and he ended up having

1:19:01.820 --> 1:19:03.620
 the worst diagnosis.

1:19:03.620 --> 1:19:07.900
 One of the worst diagnoses you can get from a random stomach ache is pancreatic cancer

1:19:07.900 --> 1:19:12.380
 because the time, the pancreas, like you can't feel anything, so by the time you feel pain,

1:19:12.380 --> 1:19:13.380
 it's too late.

1:19:13.380 --> 1:19:14.380
 It's spread already.

1:19:14.380 --> 1:19:19.220
 So I was just like, beside myself, I'm like, this is like, wow, this guy, he's got a random

1:19:19.220 --> 1:19:20.220
 stomach ache.

1:19:20.220 --> 1:19:24.100
 All I know is another man I loved had a random stomach ache and it didn't end well.

1:19:24.100 --> 1:19:30.380
 How did you deal with it emotionally, psychologically, intellectually, as a scientist?

1:19:30.380 --> 1:19:34.060
 What was that like, that whole, because it's not immediate.

1:19:34.060 --> 1:19:35.060
 It's a long journey.

1:19:35.060 --> 1:19:38.960
 It's a long journey and you don't know where the diagnosis is going.

1:19:38.960 --> 1:19:44.120
 So anyone who's suffered from a major illness, there's like always branches in the road.

1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:47.140
 So he had this intestinal blockage.

1:19:47.140 --> 1:19:50.660
 I can't imagine someone in their 40s having that and that be normal.

1:19:50.660 --> 1:19:54.540
 But the doctor is like, it could be nothing, could just cut it out.

1:19:54.540 --> 1:19:56.740
 You don't need most of your intestine, it's a repeating pattern.

1:19:56.740 --> 1:19:57.900
 Just cut that out, it could be fine.

1:19:57.900 --> 1:20:01.300
 But it ended up not being fine and he was diagnosed as being terminally ill.

1:20:01.300 --> 1:20:04.060
 Well, it really changed my life in a huge way.

1:20:04.060 --> 1:20:09.780
 First of all, I remember immediately one summer, the summer when this happened, I started asking

1:20:09.780 --> 1:20:10.780
 everyone I knew.

1:20:10.780 --> 1:20:15.300
 I would ask you, I don't know if it's smart of my job to put you on the spot, I'd say,

1:20:15.300 --> 1:20:19.620
 you have one year to live or two or three, what will you do differently about your life

1:20:19.620 --> 1:20:20.620
 now?

1:20:20.620 --> 1:20:26.580
 Lex, you have one year to live, what would you do?

1:20:26.580 --> 1:20:27.580
 I mean, it's hard.

1:20:27.580 --> 1:20:28.580
 I don't know if you want to answer that.

1:20:28.580 --> 1:20:29.580
 No, no, no.

1:20:29.580 --> 1:20:30.580
 I think about it a lot.

1:20:30.580 --> 1:20:33.540
 I mean, that's a really good thing to meditate on.

1:20:33.540 --> 1:20:41.300
 We can talk about maybe why you bring that up, if it is or not a heavy question.

1:20:41.300 --> 1:20:52.820
 But I get, I think about mortality a lot and for me, it feels like a really good way to

1:20:52.820 --> 1:20:57.820
 focus in on is what you're doing today, the people you have around you, the family you

1:20:57.820 --> 1:21:04.020
 have, does it bring you joy?

1:21:04.020 --> 1:21:07.180
 Does it bring you fulfillment?

1:21:07.180 --> 1:21:19.460
 And basically, for me, long ago, try to be ready to die any day.

1:21:19.460 --> 1:21:27.340
 So like today, I kind of woke up, look, if I was nervous about talking to you, I really

1:21:27.340 --> 1:21:33.580
 admire your work and the book is very good and it's super exciting topic.

1:21:33.580 --> 1:21:37.780
 But then, you know, there's this also feeling like, if this is the last conversation I have

1:21:37.780 --> 1:21:43.580
 in my life, you know, if I die today, will this be, will this be the right, like am I

1:21:43.580 --> 1:21:48.620
 glad today happened and it is, and I am glad today happened.

1:21:48.620 --> 1:21:49.620
 So that's the way.

1:21:49.620 --> 1:21:50.620
 And that's so unique.

1:21:50.620 --> 1:21:54.620
 I never got that answer from a single person.

1:21:54.620 --> 1:22:00.340
 The busyness of life, there's goals, there's dreams, there's like planning, plans.

1:22:00.340 --> 1:22:02.860
 Very few people make it happen.

1:22:02.860 --> 1:22:04.280
 That's what I learned.

1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:05.280
 And so a lot of these people.

1:22:05.280 --> 1:22:07.380
 Oh, like you run out of time.

1:22:07.380 --> 1:22:09.860
 It's not so much you run out of time, but I'd come back later and be like, okay, why

1:22:09.860 --> 1:22:10.860
 don't you do that?

1:22:10.860 --> 1:22:14.340
 And if that's what you would do, if you're going to die a year from now, why don't you,

1:22:14.340 --> 1:22:16.640
 why don't you make it real?

1:22:16.640 --> 1:22:17.640
 Simple things.

1:22:17.640 --> 1:22:18.640
 Spend more time with family.

1:22:18.640 --> 1:22:19.640
 Yeah.

1:22:19.640 --> 1:22:20.640
 Like why, why don't you do that?

1:22:20.640 --> 1:22:24.640
 And that's what I had an answer, it turns out, unless you usually, unless you have,

1:22:24.640 --> 1:22:29.120
 you really do have a pressing end of life, people don't do their bucket lists or try

1:22:29.120 --> 1:22:30.360
 to change their career.

1:22:30.360 --> 1:22:31.360
 And some people can't.

1:22:31.360 --> 1:22:33.900
 So we can't, like for a lot of people, they can't do anything about it.

1:22:33.900 --> 1:22:34.900
 And that's, that's fine.

1:22:34.900 --> 1:22:38.100
 But the ones who can take action for some reason, never do.

1:22:38.100 --> 1:22:44.140
 And that was one of the ways that Mike's death or at the time his impending death really,

1:22:44.140 --> 1:22:45.140
 really affected me.

1:22:45.140 --> 1:22:48.980
 Cause you know, for these sick people, what I learned, he had a bucket list and he was

1:22:48.980 --> 1:22:50.300
 able to do some of the bucket lists.

1:22:50.300 --> 1:22:51.980
 It was awesome.

1:22:51.980 --> 1:22:54.320
 But he got sick pretty quickly.

1:22:54.320 --> 1:22:58.240
 So if you do only have a year to live, it's ironic cause you can't do, you can't do the

1:22:58.240 --> 1:23:01.420
 things you wanted to do because you get too sick too fast.

1:23:01.420 --> 1:23:05.980
 What were the bucket list things for you that you realized like, what am I doing with my

1:23:05.980 --> 1:23:06.980
 life?

1:23:06.980 --> 1:23:08.540
 That was the major concept of him.

1:23:08.540 --> 1:23:09.860
 After he died, I didn't know.

1:23:09.860 --> 1:23:16.040
 Like I, I was just lost because when something that profound happens, all the things I was

1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:20.020
 doing, most of the things I was doing were just meaningless.

1:23:20.020 --> 1:23:23.940
 It was so tough to, to find an answer for that.

1:23:23.940 --> 1:23:28.780
 And that's when I settled on, I'm going to devote the rest of my life to trying to find

1:23:28.780 --> 1:23:37.420
 another earth and to find out, to find that we're not alone.

1:23:37.420 --> 1:23:42.100
 What is that longing for connection with others?

1:23:42.100 --> 1:23:43.100
 What's that about?

1:23:43.100 --> 1:23:44.100
 What do you think?

1:23:44.100 --> 1:23:45.460
 Why is that so full of meaning?

1:23:45.460 --> 1:23:46.460
 I don't know why.

1:23:46.460 --> 1:23:48.300
 I mean, I think it's how we're hardwired.

1:23:48.300 --> 1:23:54.120
 Like one of my friends some time ago, actually when my dad died, he never heard someone say

1:23:54.120 --> 1:24:01.860
 this before, but he's like, Sarah, you know, why are we evolved to take death so harshly?

1:24:01.860 --> 1:24:05.860
 Like what kind of society would we be if we just didn't care people died?

1:24:05.860 --> 1:24:07.300
 That would be a very different type of world.

1:24:07.300 --> 1:24:11.560
 How would we as a species have got to where we are?

1:24:11.560 --> 1:24:16.140
 So I think that is tied hand in hand with why do we, why do we seek connection?

1:24:16.140 --> 1:24:20.060
 It's just that what we were talking about before, that subconsciousness that we don't

1:24:20.060 --> 1:24:21.060
 understand.

1:24:21.060 --> 1:24:22.060
 Yeah.

1:24:22.060 --> 1:24:28.620
 A couple, you know, the other side, the flip side of the coin of connection and love is

1:24:28.620 --> 1:24:31.000
 a fear of loss.

1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:36.700
 It's like that was, again, I don't know, that's what makes you appreciate the moment is that

1:24:36.700 --> 1:24:37.700
 the thing ends.

1:24:37.700 --> 1:24:38.700
 Yeah.

1:24:38.700 --> 1:24:40.020
 It's definitely a hard one.

1:24:40.020 --> 1:24:45.300
 The thing ends, but, and it's hard to not, you wouldn't want to limit.

1:24:45.300 --> 1:24:49.220
 Like it's like my dog who I love so much, I'll start to cry.

1:24:49.220 --> 1:24:50.420
 Like I can't think about the end.

1:24:50.420 --> 1:24:52.740
 I know he'll age much faster than I will.

1:24:52.740 --> 1:24:53.740
 And someday it will end.

1:24:53.740 --> 1:24:54.740
 Right.

1:24:54.740 --> 1:24:57.420
 But it's too sad to think of, but should I not have got a dog?

1:24:57.420 --> 1:24:58.420
 Right.

1:24:58.420 --> 1:25:02.380
 Should I have not brought this sort of joy into my life because I know it won't be forever.

1:25:02.380 --> 1:25:03.380
 It's

1:25:03.380 --> 1:25:08.940
 well, there's a, there's a philosopher and his Becker who wrote a book, Denial of Death

1:25:08.940 --> 1:25:11.780
 and just, and warm with the cores.

1:25:11.780 --> 1:25:16.020
 And there's another book talks about terror management theory, Sheldon Solomon.

1:25:16.020 --> 1:25:18.820
 I just talked to him a few weeks ago.

1:25:18.820 --> 1:25:24.900
 It's a brilliant philosopher, psychologist that their theory, whatever you make of it

1:25:24.900 --> 1:25:32.060
 is that the fear of death is at the core of everything, everything we do.

1:25:32.060 --> 1:25:40.180
 So like you're that you think you don't think about the mortality of your dog, but you do.

1:25:40.180 --> 1:25:42.340
 And that's what makes the experience rich.

1:25:42.340 --> 1:25:49.900
 Like there's this kind of like in the shadows lurks the, the knowledge that this won't

1:25:49.900 --> 1:25:51.500
 last forever.

1:25:51.500 --> 1:25:58.740
 And that makes every moment just special in some kind of a weird way that the moments

1:25:58.740 --> 1:26:01.100
 are special for us humans.

1:26:01.100 --> 1:26:12.500
 I mean, sorry to use romantic terms like love, but what do you make, what did you learn about

1:26:12.500 --> 1:26:18.820
 love from, from losing it, from losing your husband?

1:26:18.820 --> 1:26:21.980
 Well I learned to love the things I have more.

1:26:21.980 --> 1:26:28.740
 I learned to love the people that I have more and to not let the little things bother me

1:26:28.740 --> 1:26:30.780
 as much.

1:26:30.780 --> 1:26:41.700
 What about the rediscovery or like the discovery of the little lights in the darkness?

1:26:41.700 --> 1:26:52.500
 So you, the book, I think you've brilliantly described the dark parts of your journey.

1:26:52.500 --> 1:27:00.420
 But maybe can you talk about how you were able to rediscover the lights?

1:27:00.420 --> 1:27:02.340
 They came in many ways.

1:27:02.340 --> 1:27:09.040
 And the way like to think about it is like grief is an ocean, you know, with tiny islands

1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:10.980
 of the little, like, like the little lights.

1:27:10.980 --> 1:27:15.380
 And eventually that ocean gets smaller and smaller and the islands like become continents

1:27:15.380 --> 1:27:17.180
 with lakes.

1:27:17.180 --> 1:27:22.320
 So initially it'd be like the children laughing one day or my colleagues at work who rallied

1:27:22.320 --> 1:27:28.580
 around me and would take me away from my darkness to work on a project.

1:27:28.580 --> 1:27:33.580
 Later on it turned out to be a group of women my age, all widows, all with children in my

1:27:33.580 --> 1:27:35.360
 town.

1:27:35.360 --> 1:27:40.060
 And it would be, even though it was a bit morose getting together, still very joyful

1:27:40.060 --> 1:27:42.420
 at the same time.

1:27:42.420 --> 1:27:47.260
 What was the journey of rediscovering love like for you?

1:27:47.260 --> 1:27:57.940
 So refinding, I mean, is there some, by way of advice or insight about how to, how to

1:27:57.940 --> 1:28:00.300
 rediscover the beauty of life?

1:28:00.300 --> 1:28:01.300
 Of life.

1:28:01.300 --> 1:28:02.300
 It's a hard one.

1:28:02.300 --> 1:28:09.820
 I think you just have to stay open to being positive and just to get out there.

1:28:09.820 --> 1:28:13.180
 Do you still think, do you still think about your own mortality?

1:28:13.180 --> 1:28:19.960
 So you mentioned that that was a thing that you meditate on as a question when it was

1:28:19.960 --> 1:28:22.420
 right there in front of you.

1:28:22.420 --> 1:28:23.980
 But do you still think about it?

1:28:23.980 --> 1:28:26.260
 I think I will after talking to you.

1:28:26.260 --> 1:28:28.660
 But no, it's not really something I think about.

1:28:28.660 --> 1:28:33.660
 I mean, I do think about the search for another earth and will, will I get there?

1:28:33.660 --> 1:28:38.860
 Will I be able to conclude my search and is there one?

1:28:38.860 --> 1:28:45.380
 Like as time goes by, you know, that window to solve that problem gets smaller.

1:28:45.380 --> 1:28:51.500
 What would bring you, again, I apologize if this makes concrete the fact that life is

1:28:51.500 --> 1:28:58.020
 finite, but what, what would bring you joy if we discovered while you're still here?

1:28:58.020 --> 1:28:59.380
 What would bring me joy?

1:28:59.380 --> 1:29:04.280
 Finding another earth, an earth like planet around a sun like star, knowing that there's

1:29:04.280 --> 1:29:09.860
 at least one or more out there, being able to see water, that it has signs of water and

1:29:09.860 --> 1:29:12.480
 being able to see some gases that don't belong.

1:29:12.480 --> 1:29:18.500
 So I know that the search will continue after I'm gone enough to fuel the next generation.

1:29:18.500 --> 1:29:24.140
 So just like opening the door and there's like this glimmer of hope.

1:29:24.140 --> 1:29:25.820
 What do you think it will take to realize that?

1:29:25.820 --> 1:29:29.760
 I mean, we've talked about all these interesting projects, star shade, especially, but is there

1:29:29.760 --> 1:29:36.480
 something that you're particularly kind of hopeful about in the next 10, 20 years that

1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:43.780
 might give us that, that exact glimmer of hope that there's earth like planets out there?

1:29:43.780 --> 1:29:48.900
 I have to, I stand behind star shade in all cases, so, but there is this other kind of

1:29:48.900 --> 1:29:53.220
 field that I, that everyone is involved in because star shade is hard.

1:29:53.220 --> 1:29:58.900
 Earths are hard, but there are, there's another category of planet star type that's easier.

1:29:58.900 --> 1:30:02.780
 And these are planets orbiting small red dwarf stars.

1:30:02.780 --> 1:30:04.160
 They're not earth like at all.

1:30:04.160 --> 1:30:08.060
 Think like earth cousin instead of earth twin, but there's a chance that we might establish

1:30:08.060 --> 1:30:11.500
 that some of those have water and signs of life on them.

1:30:11.500 --> 1:30:15.500
 It's nearer term than star shade and we're all working hard on that too.

1:30:15.500 --> 1:30:20.220
 Let me ask by way of recommendations, I think a lot of people are curious about this kind

1:30:20.220 --> 1:30:21.220
 of stuff.

1:30:21.220 --> 1:30:27.400
 What three books, technical or fiction or philosophical or anything really had an impact

1:30:27.400 --> 1:30:35.860
 on your life and, and or you would recommend besides of course your book.

1:30:35.860 --> 1:30:38.660
 There's one book I wish everyone could read.

1:30:38.660 --> 1:30:39.780
 I'm not sure if you've read it.

1:30:39.780 --> 1:30:42.300
 It's actually a children's book, like a young adult book.

1:30:42.300 --> 1:30:43.780
 It's called the giver.

1:30:43.780 --> 1:30:44.780
 Yes.

1:30:44.780 --> 1:30:48.660
 And it is the book that kids in school read now.

1:30:48.660 --> 1:30:52.820
 And I only, sorry, that's not, that's wow.

1:30:52.820 --> 1:30:57.300
 Sorry, that, that caught me off guard.

1:30:57.300 --> 1:30:59.620
 So when I first came to this country, I didn't speak much.

1:30:59.620 --> 1:31:05.980
 It's really what made me, it had a profound impact on my life and a really important moment

1:31:05.980 --> 1:31:07.660
 because they give it to kids.

1:31:07.660 --> 1:31:10.580
 Like I think middle school, I think, or maybe elementary, something like that.

1:31:10.580 --> 1:31:12.580
 I'm so surprised you've even heard of this book.

1:31:12.580 --> 1:31:13.580
 Yeah.

1:31:13.580 --> 1:31:17.140
 So they give it, but like it's the value of giving the right book to a person at the right

1:31:17.140 --> 1:31:18.140
 time.

1:31:18.140 --> 1:31:19.140
 Wow.

1:31:19.140 --> 1:31:22.300
 I was, I was, cause it's very accessible.

1:31:22.300 --> 1:31:25.140
 Do we want to share what the story is without spoiling it?

1:31:25.140 --> 1:31:28.100
 Oh yeah, you can without spoiling, right?

1:31:28.100 --> 1:31:32.200
 It follows this boy in this very utopic society.

1:31:32.200 --> 1:31:33.200
 That's like perfect.

1:31:33.200 --> 1:31:35.140
 It's been all clean cut and made perfect actually.

1:31:35.140 --> 1:31:41.340
 And as he kind of comes of age, he starts realizing something's wrong with his world.

1:31:41.340 --> 1:31:42.600
 And so it's part of that question.

1:31:42.600 --> 1:31:45.700
 Are we going to evolve as, I mean, this isn't what's there, but it made me wonder, you know,

1:31:45.700 --> 1:31:47.660
 are we evolving to a better place?

1:31:47.660 --> 1:31:52.980
 Is there a day when we can eliminate, you know, poverty and hunger and crime and sickness

1:31:52.980 --> 1:31:58.260
 in this book, they pretty much have in a society that the boys in and sort of follows him.

1:31:58.260 --> 1:32:01.800
 And he becomes a chosen one to be like a receiver.

1:32:01.800 --> 1:32:06.820
 The givers, the old wise man who retains some of the harshness of the outside world so that

1:32:06.820 --> 1:32:11.140
 he can advise the people as a sort of boy comes of age and is chosen for the special

1:32:11.140 --> 1:32:12.140
 role.

1:32:12.140 --> 1:32:13.840
 He finds the world isn't what he expects.

1:32:13.840 --> 1:32:17.820
 And I don't know about you, but it was so profound for me because it jolts you out of

1:32:17.820 --> 1:32:18.820
 reality.

1:32:18.820 --> 1:32:19.940
 It's like, Oh my God, what am I doing here?

1:32:19.940 --> 1:32:22.860
 I'm just going with the flow with my society.

1:32:22.860 --> 1:32:26.820
 How do I think outside the box and the confines of my society, which surely carries negative

1:32:26.820 --> 1:32:28.860
 things with it that we don't realize today.

1:32:28.860 --> 1:32:36.540
 Yeah, and also in the flip side of that is if you do take a step outside the box on occasion,

1:32:36.540 --> 1:32:39.300
 what's the psychological burden of that?

1:32:39.300 --> 1:32:42.340
 Like is that, is that a step you want to take?

1:32:42.340 --> 1:32:44.980
 Is that the journey you want to take?

1:32:44.980 --> 1:32:45.980
 What is that life like?

1:32:45.980 --> 1:32:46.980
 I don't know.

1:32:46.980 --> 1:32:48.180
 I felt like from the book, you have to take it.

1:32:48.180 --> 1:32:52.540
 I found from the book, I never thought like now that you're saying it, I see what you're

1:32:52.540 --> 1:32:53.540
 saying.

1:32:53.540 --> 1:32:56.340
 The burden is huge, but I always felt like the answer is yes, you absolutely want to

1:32:56.340 --> 1:32:57.340
 know what's outside.

1:32:57.340 --> 1:33:01.860
 But you can't do that if you're very, it's hard to be objective about your own reality.

1:33:01.860 --> 1:33:02.860
 Yeah.

1:33:02.860 --> 1:33:08.620
 I mean, it's a very human instinct, but, uh, it also, the book kind of shows that, uh,

1:33:08.620 --> 1:33:14.060
 it has an effect on you and this, it's a really interesting question about our society and

1:33:14.060 --> 1:33:16.320
 taking a step out.

1:33:16.320 --> 1:33:20.580
 It's by, uh, Lois Lowry, I think is how you pronounce it.

1:33:20.580 --> 1:33:24.160
 I really do hope everyone created it and it is a young adult book, but it's still, it's

1:33:24.160 --> 1:33:27.300
 incredibly, I'm really glad I only read it cause my kids got it for school.

1:33:27.300 --> 1:33:29.780
 I just thought, okay, well, why don't I just see what this is about?

1:33:29.780 --> 1:33:31.780
 And I just, wow.

1:33:31.780 --> 1:33:32.780
 Yeah.

1:33:32.780 --> 1:33:33.780
 Yeah.

1:33:33.780 --> 1:33:35.180
 I think it's also the value of education.

1:33:35.180 --> 1:33:38.860
 I think I'm surprised you mentioned, I've never really mentioned to anybody.

1:33:38.860 --> 1:33:44.020
 I'm sure a lot of people had the similar experience like me and maybe it's a generational thing

1:33:44.020 --> 1:33:46.340
 though, because like the book came out, I think in the nineties.

1:33:46.340 --> 1:33:50.980
 So if you're older than like me, that book didn't exist when we were in middle school.

1:33:50.980 --> 1:33:54.700
 So I just do think a lot of people won't have heard of it, but it's an interesting question

1:33:54.700 --> 1:33:58.260
 of like those books.

1:33:58.260 --> 1:34:03.060
 I mean, I'm reminded often, I suppose the same is true with other subjects, but books

1:34:03.060 --> 1:34:09.260
 are special at the early age, like middle school, maybe early high school, those can

1:34:09.260 --> 1:34:11.980
 change like the direction of your life.

1:34:11.980 --> 1:34:17.940
 And also certainly teachers, they can change completely the direction of your life.

1:34:17.940 --> 1:34:24.140
 There's so many stories about teachers of mathematics, teachers of physics, of any kind

1:34:24.140 --> 1:34:27.580
 of subjects basically changing the direction of a human's life.

1:34:27.580 --> 1:34:36.220
 That's like not to get on the whole, almost like a political thing, but you know, we,

1:34:36.220 --> 1:34:38.860
 we undervalue teachers.

1:34:38.860 --> 1:34:42.060
 It's a special, it's a special position that they hold.

1:34:42.060 --> 1:34:43.060
 That's so true.

1:34:43.060 --> 1:34:44.060
 Yeah.

1:34:44.060 --> 1:34:46.740
 Well, I do have two other books or two other things.

1:34:46.740 --> 1:34:50.100
 One is something I came across just a few days ago, actually.

1:34:50.100 --> 1:34:54.820
 It's actually a film called Picture a Scientist.

1:34:54.820 --> 1:34:59.680
 And when you picture a scientist, you probably don't picture the women and women of color

1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:01.140
 in this film.

1:35:01.140 --> 1:35:03.860
 And it is a way to get outside your box.

1:35:03.860 --> 1:35:09.020
 I really think everyone interested in science, even just peripherally should watch this because

1:35:09.020 --> 1:35:12.580
 it is shocking and sobering at the same time.

1:35:12.580 --> 1:35:17.820
 And it talks about how, well, I think one of the messages across is, you know, we really

1:35:17.820 --> 1:35:22.580
 are like, I don't know if we're hardwired to just like people like ourselves, but we're

1:35:22.580 --> 1:35:27.020
 excluding a lot of people and therefore a lot of great ideas by not being able to think

1:35:27.020 --> 1:35:30.780
 outside of how we're all stereotyping each other.

1:35:30.780 --> 1:35:34.060
 So it's, it's, it's hard to kind of convey that and you can just say, oh yeah, I want

1:35:34.060 --> 1:35:35.060
 to be more diverse.

1:35:35.060 --> 1:35:38.860
 I want to be more open, but it's a nearly impossible problem to solve and the movie

1:35:38.860 --> 1:35:42.420
 really helps open people's eyes to it.

1:35:42.420 --> 1:35:46.780
 This book I put third because unlike The Giver, people may not want to read it.

1:35:46.780 --> 1:35:47.780
 It's not as relevant.

1:35:47.780 --> 1:35:56.180
 But when I was in my early twenties, I went to this big, this like 800 people large conference

1:35:56.180 --> 1:36:00.340
 run by the Wilderness Canoe Association in my hometown of Toronto.

1:36:00.340 --> 1:36:04.780
 And there was a family friend there who I met and he said, read this book, it'll change

1:36:04.780 --> 1:36:06.060
 your life.

1:36:06.060 --> 1:36:08.220
 And it actually changed my life.

1:36:08.220 --> 1:36:13.820
 And it was a book called Sleeping Island by an author, PG Downs, who just coincidentally

1:36:13.820 --> 1:36:17.820
 lived in this area, lived in the Boston area and he was a teacher, I think at a private

1:36:17.820 --> 1:36:23.580
 school and every summer he would go to Canada with a canoe often by himself.

1:36:23.580 --> 1:36:27.380
 And he wrote this book maybe in the forties or fifties about a trip he took in the late

1:36:27.380 --> 1:36:28.380
 1930s.

1:36:28.380 --> 1:36:32.700
 And it was, I was just shocked that even at that time, although that was a long time ago,

1:36:32.700 --> 1:36:37.580
 there were large parts of Canada that were untouched by white people.

1:36:37.580 --> 1:36:40.480
 And he went up there and interacted like with the natives.

1:36:40.480 --> 1:36:45.560
 He called the book and had a subtitle that was called, there's something like Journey

1:36:45.560 --> 1:36:47.400
 in the Barren Lands.

1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:50.740
 And when you go up North in Canada, you pass the tree line, just like on a mountain, if

1:36:50.740 --> 1:36:53.580
 you hike up a mountain, you get so far North there aren't any trees.

1:36:53.580 --> 1:36:56.300
 And he wrote eloquently about the land and about being out there.

1:36:56.300 --> 1:37:00.520
 There weren't even any maps of the region, like in that time.

1:37:00.520 --> 1:37:04.540
 And I just thought to myself, wow, like that you could just take the summer off and explore

1:37:04.540 --> 1:37:07.540
 by canoe and go and see what's out there.

1:37:07.540 --> 1:37:10.620
 And it led to me just doing that, that very thing.

1:37:10.620 --> 1:37:14.980
 Of course it's different now, but going out to where the road ends and putting the canoe

1:37:14.980 --> 1:37:16.740
 in the water and just, well, we had to have a plan.

1:37:16.740 --> 1:37:21.780
 We didn't just explore, but go down this river, rivers with rapids and travel over lakes and

1:37:21.780 --> 1:37:25.540
 portages and just really live.

1:37:25.540 --> 1:37:27.540
 So just really explore, screw it.

1:37:27.540 --> 1:37:31.540
 That doesn't like, it doesn't explore just use from a topo map, from a topographical

1:37:31.540 --> 1:37:33.540
 map from the library.

1:37:33.540 --> 1:37:41.100
 There were scary elements about it, out of it, but part of the excitement or the joy

1:37:41.100 --> 1:37:45.900
 or the desire was to be scared, like it was to go out there and have live on the edge.

1:37:45.900 --> 1:37:46.900
 And persevere.

1:37:46.900 --> 1:37:47.900
 Yeah.

1:37:47.900 --> 1:37:48.900
 And persevere.

1:37:48.900 --> 1:37:49.900
 Yeah.

1:37:49.900 --> 1:37:56.540
 Do you have a advice that you would give to a young person today that would like to help

1:37:56.540 --> 1:38:03.140
 you maybe on the planetary science side, discover exoplanets or maybe bigger picture, just

1:38:03.140 --> 1:38:04.140
 succeed in life?

1:38:04.140 --> 1:38:06.380
 I do have some advice just to succeed.

1:38:06.380 --> 1:38:11.260
 It's tough advice in a way, but it is to find something that you love doing that you're

1:38:11.260 --> 1:38:13.060
 also very good at.

1:38:13.060 --> 1:38:17.500
 And in some ways the stars have to align because you've got to find that thing you're good

1:38:17.500 --> 1:38:21.780
 at or the range of things, and it actually has to overlap with something that actually

1:38:21.780 --> 1:38:23.340
 you love doing every day.

1:38:23.340 --> 1:38:26.140
 So it's not a tedious job.

1:38:26.140 --> 1:38:27.500
 That's the best way to succeed.

1:38:27.500 --> 1:38:33.060
 What were the signals that in your own life were there to make you realize you're good

1:38:33.060 --> 1:38:35.780
 at something?

1:38:35.780 --> 1:38:44.180
 What were you good at that made you pursue a PhD and it made you pursue the search?

1:38:44.180 --> 1:38:46.980
 I mean, that was the one sentence version.

1:38:46.980 --> 1:38:51.220
 In my case, it was a long slog and there were a lot of things I wasn't good at initially.

1:38:51.220 --> 1:38:53.180
 But so initially, I was good at high school math.

1:38:53.180 --> 1:38:55.140
 I was good at high school science.

1:38:55.140 --> 1:38:58.580
 I loved astronomy and I realized those could all fit together.

1:38:58.580 --> 1:39:02.740
 Like the day I realized you could be an astronomer for a job, it has to be one of my top days

1:39:02.740 --> 1:39:03.740
 of my life.

1:39:03.740 --> 1:39:08.020
 I didn't know that you could be that for a job and I was good at all those things.

1:39:08.020 --> 1:39:11.540
 And although my dad wanted me to do something more practical where he could be guaranteed

1:39:11.540 --> 1:39:16.860
 I could support myself was another option, but initially I wasn't that good at physics.

1:39:16.860 --> 1:39:21.140
 It was a slog to just get through school and grad school is a very, very long time.

1:39:21.140 --> 1:39:26.220
 And ultimately, when faced with a choice and I had the luxury of choosing, knowing that

1:39:26.220 --> 1:39:29.060
 I was good at something and also loved it, it really carried me through.

1:39:29.060 --> 1:39:34.380
 Now, I asked some of the smartest people in the world the most ridiculous question.

1:39:34.380 --> 1:39:42.140
 We already talked about it a little bit, but let me ask again, why are we here?

1:39:42.140 --> 1:39:47.020
 I think you've raised this question in one of your presentations as like one of the things

1:39:47.020 --> 1:39:52.940
 that we kind of as humans long to answer and the search for exoplanets is kind of part

1:39:52.940 --> 1:39:53.940
 of that.

1:39:53.940 --> 1:39:57.220
 But what do you think is the meaning of it all, of life?

1:39:57.220 --> 1:40:02.980
 I wish I had a good answer for you.

1:40:02.980 --> 1:40:07.140
 I think you're the first person ever who refused to answer the question.

1:40:07.140 --> 1:40:11.540
 It's not so much refusing, I just, yeah, I mean, I wish I had a better answer.

1:40:11.540 --> 1:40:12.860
 It's why we're here.

1:40:12.860 --> 1:40:20.540
 It's almost like the meaning is wishing there was a meaning, wishing we knew.

1:40:20.540 --> 1:40:21.540
 I love that.

1:40:21.540 --> 1:40:24.460
 That's a great way to say it.

1:40:24.460 --> 1:40:27.140
 Sarah, like I said, the book is excellent.

1:40:27.140 --> 1:40:33.620
 I admired your work from afar for a while and I think you're one of the great stars

1:40:33.620 --> 1:40:34.620
 at MIT.

1:40:34.620 --> 1:40:37.340
 It makes me proud to be part of the community.

1:40:37.340 --> 1:40:40.260
 So thank you so much for your work.

1:40:40.260 --> 1:40:41.500
 Thank you for inspiring all of us.

1:40:41.500 --> 1:40:42.500
 Thanks for talking today.

1:41:07.700 --> 1:41:08.980
 sure how.

1:41:08.980 --> 1:41:14.740
 Just keep typing stuff in until you get to the guy with the tie and the thumbnail.

1:41:14.740 --> 1:41:20.500
 And now let me leave you with some words from Carl Sagan, somewhere something incredible

1:41:20.500 --> 1:41:23.000
 is waiting to be known.

1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:39.820
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
