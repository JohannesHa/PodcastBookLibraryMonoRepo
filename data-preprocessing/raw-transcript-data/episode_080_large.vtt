 The following is a conversation with Vitalik Buterin, co creator of and author of the white

00:05.920 --> 00:11.960
 paper that launched Ethereum and Ether, which is a cryptocurrency that is currently the

00:11.960 --> 00:15.640
 second largest digital currency after Bitcoin.

00:15.640 --> 00:20.360
 Ethereum has a lot of interesting technical ideas that are defining the future of blockchain

00:20.360 --> 00:27.040
 technology and Vitalik is one of the most brilliant people innovating in the space today.

00:27.040 --> 00:34.860
 Unlike Satoshi Nakamoto, the unknown person or group that created Bitcoin, Vitalik is

00:34.860 --> 00:41.480
 very well known and at a young age is thrust into the limelight as one of the main faces

00:41.480 --> 00:47.840
 of the technology that may redefine the nature of money and all forms of digital transactions

00:47.840 --> 01:17.760
 in the 21st century.

01:17.760 --> 01:24.200

01:48.440 --> 01:53.200
 When I first heard about Masterclass, I honestly thought it was too good to be true.

01:53.200 --> 01:59.720
 For $180 a year, you get an all access pass to watch courses from experts at the top of

01:59.720 --> 02:00.720
 their field.

02:00.720 --> 02:06.400
 To list some of my favorites, Chris Hatfield on space exploration, Neil deGrasse Tyson

02:06.400 --> 02:12.800
 on scientific thinking and communication, Will Wright, the creator of SimCity and Sims

02:12.800 --> 02:20.480
 on game design, Jane Goodall on conservation, Carlos Santana, one of my favorite guitarists

02:20.480 --> 02:29.720
 on guitar, Garry Kasparov on chess, Daniel Negrano on poker, one of my favorite poker

02:29.720 --> 02:35.680
 players, Phil Ivey gives a course as well, and many more.

02:35.680 --> 02:39.860
 Chris Hatfield explaining how rockets work and the experience of being launched into

02:39.860 --> 02:43.280
 space alone is worth the money.

02:43.280 --> 02:48.600
 By way of advice, for me, the key is not to be overwhelmed by the abundance of choice.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.680
 Pick three courses you want to complete.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.600
 Watch each all the way through from start to finish.

02:52.600 --> 02:56.800
 It's not that long, but it's an experience that will stick with you for a long time,

02:56.800 --> 02:58.360
 I promise.

02:58.360 --> 02:59.820
 It's easily worth the money.

02:59.820 --> 03:02.480

 I've been using ExpressVPN for many years.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.960
 I honestly love it.

03:25.960 --> 03:31.240
 It's easy to use, press the big power on button, and your privacy is protected.

03:31.240 --> 03:35.800
 And if you like, you can make it look like your location is anywhere else in the world.

03:35.800 --> 03:41.080
 I might be in Boston now, but I can make it look like I'm in New York, London, Paris,

03:41.080 --> 03:42.920
 or anywhere else.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.540
 This has a large number of obvious benefits.

03:45.540 --> 03:50.400
 For example, certainly it allows you to access international versions of streaming websites

03:50.400 --> 03:55.640
 like the Japanese version of Netflix or the UK version of Hulu.

03:55.640 --> 04:00.720
 As you probably know, I was born in the Soviet Union, so sadly, given my roots and appreciation

04:00.720 --> 04:06.760
 of Russian history and culture, my website and the website for this podcast is blocked

04:06.760 --> 04:08.560
 in Russia.

04:08.560 --> 04:15.360
 So this is another example of where you can use ExpressVPN to access sites like the podcast

04:15.360 --> 04:19.120
 that are not accessible in your country.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.920
 ExpressVPN works on any device you can imagine.

04:21.920 --> 04:28.160
 I use it on Linux, shout out to Ubuntu, Windows, Android, but it's available everywhere else

04:28.160 --> 04:29.400
 too.

04:38.800 --> 04:44.100
 And now here's my conversation with Vitalik Buterin.

04:44.100 --> 04:50.200
 So before we talk about the fundamental ideas behind Ethereum and cryptocurrency, perhaps

04:50.200 --> 04:58.520
 it'd be nice to talk about the origin story of Bitcoin and the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto.

04:58.520 --> 05:04.080
 You gave a talk that started with sort of asking the question, what did Satoshi Nakamoto

05:04.080 --> 05:06.280
 actually invent?

05:06.280 --> 05:10.000
 Maybe you could say who is Satoshi Nakamoto and what did he invent?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
 Sure.

05:11.000 --> 05:19.040
 So Satoshi Nakamoto is the name by which we know the person who originally came up with

05:19.040 --> 05:20.040
 Bitcoin.

05:20.040 --> 05:25.480
 So the reason why I say the name by which we know is that this is an anonymous fellow

05:25.480 --> 05:33.640
 who has shown himself to us only over the internet just by first publishing the white

05:33.640 --> 05:39.440
 paper for Bitcoin, then releasing the original source code for Bitcoin, and then talking

05:39.440 --> 05:46.760
 to the very early Bitcoin community on Bitcoin forums and interacting with them and helping

05:46.760 --> 05:49.640
 the project along for a couple of years.

05:49.640 --> 05:55.840
 And then at some point in late 2010 to early 2011, he disappeared.

05:55.840 --> 06:05.160
 So Bitcoin is a fairly unique project in how it has this kind of mythical, kind of quasi

06:05.160 --> 06:10.800
 godlike founder who just kind of popped in, did the thing and then disappeared and we've

06:10.800 --> 06:13.120
 somehow just never heard from him again.

06:13.120 --> 06:18.360
 So in 2008, so the white paper was the first, do you know if the white paper was the first

06:18.360 --> 06:22.160
 time the name would actually appear, Satoshi Nakamoto?

06:22.160 --> 06:23.720
 I believe so.

06:23.720 --> 06:31.580
 So how is it possible that the creator of such an impactful project remains anonymous?

06:31.580 --> 06:34.280
 That's a tough question.

06:34.280 --> 06:38.520
 There's no similarity to it in the history of technology as far as I'm aware.

06:38.520 --> 06:39.520
 Yeah.

06:39.520 --> 06:46.200
 So one possibility is that it's hellfinny because hellfinny was kind of also active

06:46.200 --> 06:53.800
 in the Bitcoin community and as hellfinny in those two beginning years.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.920
 Who is hellfinny, maybe you could say?

06:55.920 --> 07:00.760
 He is one of the people in the early cypherpunk community.

07:00.760 --> 07:12.720
 He was a computer scientist, cryptographers, people interested in technology, internet

07:12.720 --> 07:14.880
 freedom, like those kinds of topics.

07:14.880 --> 07:19.040
 Was it correct that I read that he seemed to have been involved in either the earliest

07:19.040 --> 07:21.960
 or the first transaction of Bitcoin?

07:21.960 --> 07:22.960
 Yes.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.760
 The first transaction of Bitcoin was between Satoshi and hellfinny.

07:25.760 --> 07:28.520
 Do you think he knew who Satoshi was?

07:28.520 --> 07:31.380
 If he wasn't Satoshi, probably no.

07:31.380 --> 07:36.900
 How is it possible to work so closely with people and nevertheless not know anything

07:36.900 --> 07:39.860
 about their fundamental identity?

07:39.860 --> 07:43.880
 Is this like a natural sort of characteristic of the internet?

07:43.880 --> 07:51.680
 Like if we were to think about it, because you and I just met now, there's a depth of

07:51.680 --> 07:56.600
 knowledge that we now have about each other that's like physical, like my vision system

07:56.600 --> 07:58.200
 is able to recognize you.

07:58.200 --> 08:05.960
 I can also verify your identity of uniqueness, like it's very hard to fake you being you.

08:05.960 --> 08:11.360
 So the internet has a fundamentally different quality to it, which is just fascinating.

08:11.360 --> 08:20.160
 This is definitely interesting as I definitely just know a lot of people just by their internet

08:20.160 --> 08:21.160
 handles.

08:21.160 --> 08:26.840
 And to me, when I think of them, I see their internet handles and one of them has a kind

08:26.840 --> 08:33.080
 of profile picture as this kind of face that's kind of not quite human with a bunch of psychedelic

08:33.080 --> 08:34.240
 colors in it.

08:34.240 --> 08:37.480
 And when I visualize him, I could just visualize that.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.920
 That's not an actual face.

08:40.920 --> 08:45.960
 You are the creator of the second, well, he's currently the second most popular cryptocurrency

08:45.960 --> 08:46.960
 Ethereum.

08:46.960 --> 08:53.040
 So on this topic, if we just stick on Satoshi Nakamoto for a little bit longer, you may

08:53.040 --> 08:58.240
 be the most qualified person to speak to the psychology of this anonymity that we're talking

08:58.240 --> 08:59.240
 about.

08:59.240 --> 09:03.780
 Like your identity is known, like I've just verified it.

09:03.780 --> 09:10.420
 But from your perspective, what are the benefits in creating a cryptocurrency and then remaining

09:10.420 --> 09:11.420
 anonymous?

09:11.420 --> 09:17.200
 Like if it can psychoanalyze Satoshi Nakamoto, is there something interesting there?

09:17.200 --> 09:20.400
 Or is it just a peculiar quirk of him?

09:20.400 --> 09:26.920
 It definitely helps create this kind of image of this kind of neutral thing that doesn't

09:26.920 --> 09:28.920
 belong to anyone.

09:28.920 --> 09:36.720
 And that you created a project and because you're anonymous and because you also disappear

09:36.720 --> 09:42.360
 or as unfortunately happened to Hal Finney, if that is him, he ended up dying of Lou Gehrig's

09:42.360 --> 09:45.520
 disease and he's in the cryogenic freezer now.

09:45.520 --> 09:55.840
 But if you pop in and you create it and you're gone and all that's remaining of that whole

09:55.840 --> 10:03.940
 process is the thing itself, then no one can go and try to interpret any of your other

10:03.940 --> 10:13.200
 behavior and try to understand like, oh, this person wrote this thing in some essay at age

10:13.200 --> 10:16.880
 16 where he expressed particular opinions about democracy.

10:16.880 --> 10:21.320
 And so because of that, this project is a statement that's trying to do this specific

10:21.320 --> 10:22.320
 thing.

10:22.320 --> 10:30.680
 Instead, it creates this environment where the thing is what you make of it.

10:30.680 --> 10:35.320
 It doesn't have the burden of your other ideas, political thought and so on.

10:35.320 --> 10:43.160
 So now that we're sitting with you, do you feel the burden of being kind of the face

10:43.160 --> 10:44.160
 of Ethereum?

10:44.160 --> 10:49.860
 I mean, there's a very large community of developers, but nevertheless, is there like

10:49.860 --> 10:52.200
 a burden associated with that?

10:52.200 --> 10:53.500
 There definitely is.

10:53.500 --> 11:00.260
 This is definitely a big reason why I've been trying to kind of push for the Ethereum ecosystem

11:00.260 --> 11:06.740
 to become more decentralized in many ways, just encouraging a lot of core Ethereum work

11:06.740 --> 11:11.860
 to happen outside of the Ethereum Foundation and of expanding the number of people that

11:11.860 --> 11:17.280
 are making different kinds of decisions, having multiple software limitations instead of one

11:17.280 --> 11:18.640
 and all of these things.

11:18.640 --> 11:25.480
 There's a lot of things that I've tried to do to remove myself as a single point of failure

11:25.480 --> 11:31.900
 because that is something that a lot of people criticize me for.

11:31.900 --> 11:37.640
 So if you look at like the most fundamentally successful open source projects, it seems

11:37.640 --> 11:43.480
 that it's like a sad reality when I think about it, is it seems to be that one person

11:43.480 --> 11:51.800
 is a crucial contributor often, if you look at Linus for Linux for the kernel.

11:51.800 --> 11:56.680
 That is possible and I'm definitely not planning to disappear.

11:56.680 --> 12:04.360
 That's an interesting tension that projects like this kind of desire a single entity and

12:04.360 --> 12:08.800
 yet they're fundamentally distributed.

12:08.800 --> 12:12.940
 I don't know if there's something interesting to say about that kind of structure and thinking

12:12.940 --> 12:17.620
 about the future of cryptocurrency, does there need to be a leader?

12:17.620 --> 12:20.800
 There's different kinds of leaders.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.920
 There's dictators who control all the money.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.120
 There's people who control organizations.

12:25.120 --> 12:30.540
 There's high priests that just have themselves other Twitter followers.

12:30.540 --> 12:33.680
 What kind of leader are you, would you say?

12:33.680 --> 12:42.720
 These days, actually a bit more in the high priest direction than before.

12:42.720 --> 12:48.400
 I definitely actually don't do all that much of going around and ordering Ethereum Foundation

12:48.400 --> 12:52.680
 people to do things because I think those things are important.

12:52.680 --> 12:58.080
 If there's something that I do think is important, I do just usually kind of say it publicly

12:58.080 --> 13:05.120
 or just kind of say it to people and quite often projects just going to start doing it.

13:05.120 --> 13:10.360
 So let's ask the high philosophical question about money.

13:10.360 --> 13:13.160
 What at the highest level is money?

13:13.160 --> 13:15.420
 What is money?

13:15.420 --> 13:21.120
 It's a kind of game and it's a game where we have points and if you have points, there's

13:21.120 --> 13:24.560
 this one move where you can reduce your points by a number and increase someone else's points

13:24.560 --> 13:26.560
 by the same number.

13:26.560 --> 13:29.880
 So it's a fair game, hopefully.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.440
 Well, it's one kind of fair game.

13:32.440 --> 13:35.040
 For example, you can have other kinds of fair games.

13:35.040 --> 13:38.280
 You're going to have a game where if I give someone a point and you give someone a point

13:38.280 --> 13:42.440
 and instead of that person getting two points, that person gets four points and that's also

13:42.440 --> 13:43.440
 fair.

13:43.440 --> 13:51.420
 But, you know, money is easy to kind of set up and it serves a lot of useful functions

13:51.420 --> 13:57.840
 and so it kind of just survives in society as a meme for thousands of years.

13:57.840 --> 14:04.120
 It's useful for the storage of wealth, it's useful for the exchange of value.

14:04.120 --> 14:09.560
 And it's also useful for denominating future payments, a unit of account.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.440
 A unit of account.

14:11.440 --> 14:18.680
 So what, if you look at the history of money in human civilization, just if you're a student

14:18.680 --> 14:26.000
 of history, how has its role or just the mechanisms of money changed over time in your view?

14:26.000 --> 14:30.640
 Even if we just look at the 20th century or before and then leading up to cryptocurrencies,

14:30.640 --> 14:32.160
 that's something you think about?

14:32.160 --> 14:39.440
 Yeah, and I think the big thing in the 20th century is kind of, we saw a lot more intermediation,

14:39.440 --> 14:41.520
 I guess.

14:41.520 --> 14:49.800
 The first part is kind of the move from adding more of different kinds of banking and then

14:49.800 --> 14:57.600
 we saw the move from dollars being backed by gold to dollars being backed by gold that's

14:57.600 --> 15:05.440
 only redeemable by certain people to dollars not being backed by anything to this system

15:05.440 --> 15:12.720
 where you have a bunch of free floating currencies and then people getting kind of bank accounts

15:12.720 --> 15:16.400
 and then those things becoming electronic, people getting accounts with payment processors

15:16.400 --> 15:20.320
 that have bank accounts.

15:20.320 --> 15:25.720
 So what do you make of that, that's such a fascinating philosophical idea that money

15:25.720 --> 15:29.940
 might not be backed by anything.

15:29.940 --> 15:33.680
 Is that like fascinating to you that money can exist without being backed by something

15:33.680 --> 15:35.480
 physical?

15:35.480 --> 15:36.480
 It definitely is.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.480
 What do you make of that?

15:39.480 --> 15:40.480
 How is that possible?

15:40.480 --> 15:41.480
 Is that stable?

15:41.480 --> 15:45.760
 If we look at the future of human civilization, is it possible to have money at the large

15:45.760 --> 15:52.480
 scale at such a hugely productive and rich societies be able to operate successfully

15:52.480 --> 15:54.920
 without money being backed by anything physical?

15:54.920 --> 16:01.200
 I feel like the interesting thing about the 21st century especially is that a lot of the

16:01.200 --> 16:04.420
 important valuable things are not backed by anything.

16:04.420 --> 16:10.640
 If you look at tech companies for example, something like Twitter, you could theoretically

16:10.640 --> 16:15.960
 imagine that if all of the employees wanted to, they could kind of come together, they

16:15.960 --> 16:27.760
 would quit and start working on Twitter 2.0 and then the value of and just kind of build

16:27.760 --> 16:32.580
 the exact same product or possibly build a better product and then just kind of continue

16:32.580 --> 16:40.440
 on from there and the original Twitter would just not have people left anymore.

16:40.440 --> 16:44.820
 There is theoretically kind of code and IP that's owned by the company but in reality

16:44.820 --> 16:48.820
 like good programmers could probably rewrite all that stuff in three months.

16:48.820 --> 16:56.560
 So the reason why the thing has value is just kind of network effects and coordination problems

16:56.560 --> 17:01.640
 right like these employees in reality aren't going to switch all at once and also the users

17:01.640 --> 17:05.960
 aren't all going to switch at once because it's just difficult for them to switch at

17:05.960 --> 17:14.560
 once and so there's these kind of meta stable and of equilibrium in interactions between

17:14.560 --> 17:20.500
 thousands of millions of people that are just actually quite sticky even though if you try

17:20.500 --> 17:24.880
 to kind of assume that everyone's a perfectly rational and kind of perfectly slippery spherical

17:24.880 --> 17:28.160
 cow they don't seem to exist at all.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.160
 That stickiness.

17:29.160 --> 17:34.800
 Do you have a sense, a grasp of the sort of the fundamental dynamic like the physics of

17:34.800 --> 17:36.320
 that stickiness?

17:36.320 --> 17:43.760
 It seems to work but and I think some of the cryptocurrency ideas kind of rely on it working.

17:43.760 --> 17:51.880
 It's the sort of thing that's definitely been economically modeled a lot like one of the

17:51.880 --> 17:59.840
 kind of analogy of something as similar that you often see in textbooks as like what is

17:59.840 --> 18:05.620
 a government like if for example like 80% of people in a country just like tomorrow

18:05.620 --> 18:11.020
 suddenly had the idea that like the laws that are currently the laws of the government that

18:11.020 --> 18:15.640
 currently is the government are just people and some other thing is the government and

18:15.640 --> 18:19.580
 they just kind of start acting like it then that would kind of become the new reality

18:19.580 --> 18:27.020
 and then the question is well what happens if and if between zero and 80% of people start

18:27.020 --> 18:34.240
 believing that and like what is the thing you also you see is that if there is one of

18:34.240 --> 18:38.120
 these kind of switches happening is kind of revolution then if you're the first person

18:38.120 --> 18:44.480
 to join then like you probably don't have the incentive to do that but then if you're

18:44.480 --> 18:51.560
 the 55th percentile person to join then suddenly becomes quite safe too and so it's definitely

18:51.560 --> 18:56.960
 is the sort of thing that you can kind of try to analyze and understand mathematically

18:56.960 --> 19:06.980
 but one of the kind of results is that the sort of like when the switch happens definitely

19:06.980 --> 19:13.080
 can be chaotic sometimes yeah but still like to me the idea that the network affects that

19:13.080 --> 19:19.240
 the fact that human beings at a scale like millions billions can share even the idea

19:19.240 --> 19:25.920
 of currency like yeah I'll agree that's just uh I know economists can model it I'm a skeptic

19:25.920 --> 19:32.080
 on the economic and uh it's like uh so my my favorite sort of field maybe recreationally

19:32.080 --> 19:36.920
 psychology is trying to understand human behavior and I think sometimes people just kind of

19:36.920 --> 19:42.120
 pretend that they can have a grasp on human behavior even though we it's such a messy

19:42.120 --> 19:46.200
 space that all the models that psychology or economics those different perspectives

19:46.200 --> 19:53.060
 on human behavior can have are are difficult it's difficult to know how much that's wishful

19:53.060 --> 19:58.160
 thinking and how much it is actually getting to the core of uh understanding human behavior

19:58.160 --> 20:08.440
 but on that idea what do you think is the role of money in human motivation so do you

20:08.440 --> 20:15.720
 think money from an economics perspective from a psychology perspective is core to like

20:15.720 --> 20:23.480
 human desires money is definitely very far from the only motivator um it is a big motivator

20:23.480 --> 20:30.200
 and that's uh one of the closest things you have to a universal motivator think because

20:30.200 --> 20:36.040
 ultimately in like almost any person in the world if you ask them to do something like

20:36.040 --> 20:41.080
 they'll be more inclined to do it if you also offer some uh offer them money right and that's

20:41.080 --> 20:47.460
 uh like there's definitely many cases where people will do things other than things that

20:47.460 --> 20:52.240
 maximize how much money they have and that happens all the time but like though a lot

20:52.240 --> 20:57.360
 of those other things are kind of but much more specific to and of who that person is

20:57.360 --> 21:01.000
 and of what their situation is the relationship between the motive and the action and these

21:01.000 --> 21:05.800
 other things what do you think is the interplay of the other motivator from like Nietzsche

21:05.800 --> 21:11.960
 perspective is power do you think money equals power do you think those are conflicting ideas

21:11.960 --> 21:16.520
 do you think i mean that's the one of the ideas that decentralized currency decentralized

21:16.520 --> 21:23.160
 applications are looking at is uh who holds the power yeah money is definitely a kind

21:23.160 --> 21:29.600
 of power and there's definitely people who want money because it gives them power and

21:29.600 --> 21:37.800
 even if my money doesn't seem to and if explicitly be about money a lot of things that people

21:37.800 --> 21:44.880
 spend money on are ultimately about a social status of some kind um so i mean i definitely

21:44.880 --> 21:50.480
 view those two things as an of interplaying and then there's also money as just a way

21:50.480 --> 21:57.280
 of like measuring how successful you are like as a scoreboard right so this kind of gets

21:57.280 --> 22:04.200
 back to the game i mean like if you have four billion dollars then the main benefit you

22:04.200 --> 22:08.040
 get from going up one of the big benefits you get from going up to six million dollars

22:08.040 --> 22:12.200
 is that now instead of being below the guy who has five you're above the guy who has

22:12.200 --> 22:19.080
 five so you think money could be kind of uh in the game of life it's also a measure of

22:19.080 --> 22:25.660
 self worth it's like how we it's definitely how uh how a lot of people perceive it define

22:25.660 --> 22:30.400
 ourselves in the hierarchy of yeah and i'm not yeah not saying it's kind of a healthy

22:30.400 --> 22:36.480
 thing that people uh define their self worth as money because it's definitely kind of far

22:36.480 --> 22:43.880
 from a uh perfect indicator of how much you value you provide the society or anything

22:43.880 --> 22:49.500
 like this but i definitely think that like as a matter of kind of current practice so

22:49.500 --> 22:56.200
 much of people do feel that way so what does utopia from an economic perspective look like

22:56.200 --> 23:04.920
 to you what does the perfect world look like i guess the economist's utopia would be one

23:04.920 --> 23:12.640
 where kind of everything is incentive aligned in the in the sense that there aren't enough

23:12.640 --> 23:20.440
 conflicts between what satisfies your goals and kind of what is uh good for everyone in

23:20.440 --> 23:26.820
 the world in the world as a whole what do you think that would um look like does does

23:26.820 --> 23:32.420
 that mean there's still poor people and rich people there's still income inequality do

23:32.420 --> 23:41.320
 you think sort of uh marxist ideas are strong do you think sort of ideas of uh objectivism

23:41.320 --> 23:47.120
 like where the market rules is strong like what is there is the different economic philosophies

23:47.120 --> 23:55.140
 that just seem to be reflective what utopia would be so i definitely think that existing

23:55.140 --> 24:02.640
 economic philosophies do end up kind of systematically kind of deviating from the utopia in a lot

24:02.640 --> 24:07.720
 of ways yeah like one of the big things i talk about for example is public goods right

24:07.720 --> 24:13.440
 and public goods are especially important on the internet right because like the idea

24:13.440 --> 24:18.920
 is with kind of money as this game where you know i lose a few coin a few coins and you

24:18.920 --> 24:23.140
 gain the same number of coins is that this usually happens in a trade where i lose some

24:23.140 --> 24:30.680
 money you gain some money you lose a sandwich and i gain a sandwich and this kind of model

24:30.680 --> 24:36.680
 works really well when the thing that we're using money to incentivize this kind of private

24:36.680 --> 24:40.680
 goods right things that you provide to one person where the benefit comes to one person

24:40.680 --> 24:48.040
 but the like on the internet especially but also many many contexts and if off the internet

24:48.040 --> 24:53.960
 there's actions that kind of individuals or groups can take where instead of the benefit

24:53.960 --> 25:00.200
 going to one person the benefit just goes to many people at the same time and you can't

25:00.200 --> 25:04.600
 control where the benefit goes to right so for example this podcast you know we publish

25:04.600 --> 25:11.120
 it and when it's published you don't have any fine grains control over like oh these

25:11.120 --> 25:16.800
 38 000 people can watch it and then like these other 29 000 people can't it's like once the

25:16.800 --> 25:21.400
 number goes high enough then you know people just like copy it and then when i write articles

25:21.400 --> 25:26.940
 on a blog then they're just like free for everyone and that stuff's even harder to prevent

25:26.940 --> 25:33.020
 anyone from copying so and aside from that things like you know scientific research for

25:33.020 --> 25:39.200
 example and even taking more pedestrian examples like climate change mitigation would be a

25:39.200 --> 25:47.320
 big one so there's a lot of things in the world where you have these kind of individual

25:47.320 --> 25:51.620
 actions with enough concentrated costs and distributed benefits and money as a point

25:51.620 --> 25:58.920
 system does not do a good job of encouraging these things and one of the kind of other

25:58.920 --> 26:05.320
 things even kind of tangentially connected to crypto but kind of theoretically outside

26:05.320 --> 26:10.400
 of it that i work on is this sort of mechanism called quadratic funding and the way to think

26:10.400 --> 26:19.880
 about it is i kind of imagine a point system where if like if one person gives coin gives

26:19.880 --> 26:26.940
 coins to one other person then it works the same way as money but if multiple people give

26:26.940 --> 26:32.160
 coins to one person and they do so anonymously so it's kind of not in consideration for a

26:32.160 --> 26:38.240
 specific service to that person themselves then the number of coins received by that

26:38.240 --> 26:43.020
 person is kind of greater than just the sum of the number of coins that have given by

26:43.020 --> 26:48.600
 those different people so the actual formula is you take the square root of the amount

26:48.600 --> 26:51.640
 that each person gave then you add all the square roots and then you kind of square the

26:51.640 --> 26:58.480
 sum yeah and then you give that and the idea here would basically be that if let's say

26:58.480 --> 27:05.520
 for example you just start going off and kind of planting a lot of trees and there's a bunch

27:05.520 --> 27:09.320
 of people that are really happy that you're planting trees and then so they go and all

27:09.320 --> 27:16.680
 kind of throw a coin your way then the like there is like basically the fact that kind

27:16.680 --> 27:21.640
 of you get more than the sub you get this kind of square of sum of these of square roots

27:21.640 --> 27:27.420
 of these tiny nodes that this actually kind of compensates for the tragedy of the commons

27:27.420 --> 27:31.480
 right this there's even this kind of mathematical proof that it's sort of optimally compensates

27:31.480 --> 27:38.120
 for it what is the tragedy of the common this is just this idea that like if there is this

27:38.120 --> 27:45.640
 situation where there's some public good that lots of people benefit from then no individual

27:45.640 --> 27:49.040
 person wants to contribute to it because if they contribute they only get a small part

27:49.040 --> 27:54.880
 of the benefit from their contribution but they pay the full cost of their contribution

27:54.880 --> 28:01.320
 in which context is this sorry what is the term quadratic what quadratic funding like

28:01.320 --> 28:08.800
 what's in which context is this mechanism useful so obviously you said to combat the

28:08.800 --> 28:13.000
 tragedy of the commons but you know in which context do you see it as useful actually practically

28:13.000 --> 28:18.080
 yeah theoretically public goods in general right so like like services like what are

28:18.080 --> 28:23.440
 we what are we talking about what's a public yeah so within the ethereum ecosystem for

28:23.440 --> 28:28.440
 example like we've actually tried using this mechanism like yeah wrote a couple of articles

28:28.440 --> 28:33.280
 about this on vitalik.ca where i go through some of the most recent rounds and it's been

28:33.280 --> 28:40.760
 really interesting um some of the top ones that people supported there were um things

28:40.760 --> 28:46.880
 like kind of just online user interfaces that make it easier for people to interact with

28:46.880 --> 28:57.680
 ethereum um there was a documentation there were podcasts um there were kind of software

28:57.680 --> 29:03.740
 kind of clients like kind of implementations of the ethereum protocol of privacy tools

29:03.740 --> 29:10.120
 just like lots of things that are kind of useful to lots of people when a lot of people

29:10.120 --> 29:15.600
 are contributing for like funding a particular particular entity yeah that's really that's

29:15.600 --> 29:20.560
 really interesting is there something special about the quadratic the the the summing of

29:20.560 --> 29:25.720
 the square roots and yeah so another way to think about it is like imagine if n people

29:25.720 --> 29:32.180
 each give a dollar then the person gets n squared right um and and so each individual

29:32.180 --> 29:37.200
 person's contribution gets multiplied by n right because you have n people and so that

29:37.200 --> 29:41.880
 kind of perfectly compensates for the kind like kind of n to one uh tragedy of the commons

29:41.880 --> 29:49.120
 i just wonder if the the squared part is yeah fundamental no it is um and i'd uh recommend

29:49.120 --> 29:56.280
 you go to on vitalik.ca i have this article called quadratic payments a primer and highly

29:56.280 --> 30:01.040
 recommended it's kind of at least my attempt so far kind of explaining the intuition behind

30:01.040 --> 30:09.740
 this intuition so if we could can we go to the the very basics what is the blockchain

30:09.740 --> 30:16.080
 or perhaps we might even start at the uh the the byzantine generals problem and byzantine

30:16.080 --> 30:24.480
 fault tolerance in general that i i uh bitcoin was taking steps to uh providing a solution

30:24.480 --> 30:32.400
 for so the byzantine generals problem it's this uh paper that leslie lamport published

30:32.400 --> 30:38.040
 in 1982 where he has this thought experiments where if you have two generals that are kind

30:38.040 --> 30:43.400
 of camped out on opposite sides of a city um and they're planning when to attack the

30:43.400 --> 30:50.080
 city then uh the question is and if how could those generals coordinate with each other

30:50.080 --> 30:56.320
 and they could send messengers between each other but those messengers kind of could get

30:56.320 --> 31:01.560
 sniped by the enemy on the road road some of those messages could end up being traders

31:01.560 --> 31:11.080
 and if things could end up happening and with just two mess generals it turns out that there's

31:11.080 --> 31:17.640
 kind of no solution in a finite number of rounds that guarantees that they will be able

31:17.640 --> 31:22.120
 to kind of coordinate on the same answer but then in the case where you have more than

31:22.120 --> 31:28.520
 two generals that then leslie analyzes cases like um are the mess messages kind of just

31:28.520 --> 31:34.040
 oral messages um are the messages kind of signed messages so i could give you a signed

31:34.040 --> 31:38.240
 message and you can pass along that signed message and the third party can still verify

31:38.240 --> 31:44.720
 that i originally made that message and depending on those different cases there's kind of different

31:44.720 --> 31:51.640
 bounds on like given how many generals and how many traders among those generals and

31:51.640 --> 31:59.120
 if what like under what conditions you actually can't agree when to launch an attack uh so

31:59.120 --> 32:03.800
 it's actually a big misconception that the byzantine generalist problem was unsolved

32:03.800 --> 32:09.160
 so let's say lamport solved it the thing that was unsolved though is that all of these solutions

32:09.160 --> 32:14.680
 assume that you've already agreed on and have fixed the list of who the generals are and

32:14.680 --> 32:18.440
 these generals have to be kind of semi trusted to some extent they can't just be anonymous

32:18.440 --> 32:22.960
 people because if they're anonymous then like the enemy could just be 99 percent of the

32:22.960 --> 32:32.480
 generals uh so right the um in the 1980s and the 1990s kind of the general use case

32:32.480 --> 32:38.920
 for distributed system stuff was more kind of enterprisey stuff where you could kind

32:38.920 --> 32:45.480
 of assume that uh you know you know who the nodes are that are running these kind of computer

32:45.480 --> 32:50.160
 networks so if he wants to have some kind of decentralized computer network that pretends

32:50.160 --> 32:55.880
 to be a single computer and that you can kind of do do kind of operations on then it's made

32:55.880 --> 33:00.840
 out of these kind of 15 specific computers and we know kind of who and where they are

33:00.840 --> 33:05.240
 and so we have a good reason to believe that say at least 11 of them would be fine and

33:05.240 --> 33:11.600
 it could also be within a single system exactly almost a network of devices sensors so on

33:11.600 --> 33:16.920
 like in airplanes and i think uh like flight systems in general still use these kinds of

33:16.920 --> 33:23.160
 ideas yep yep um so that's the 80s that's the 80s and 90s now the cypherpunks had a

33:23.160 --> 33:28.320
 different use case in mind which is that they wanted to create a fully decentralized global

33:28.320 --> 33:34.560
 permissionless currency and the problem here is that they didn't want any authorities and

33:34.560 --> 33:39.520
 they didn't even want any kind of privileged list of people and so now the question is

33:39.520 --> 33:46.760
 well how do you use these techniques to create consensus when you have no way of kind of

33:46.760 --> 33:52.080
 measuring identities right you have no way of kind of determining whether or not some

33:52.080 --> 33:58.680
 99 of participants aren't actually all the same guy and so the clever solution that satoshi

33:58.680 --> 34:05.560
 had this is uh kind of going back to the that presentation i made at defcon a few months ago where i said that the

34:05.560 --> 34:11.740
 things that satoshi invented with crypto economics um is this uh really neat idea that you can

34:11.740 --> 34:20.800
 use economic resources to kind of limit identity how many identities you can get and the uh

34:20.800 --> 34:25.360
 if there isn't any existing decentralized digital currency then the only way to do this

34:25.360 --> 34:33.640
 is with proof of work right so with proof of work the solution is uh just uh you publish

34:33.640 --> 34:40.800
 a solution to a hard mathematical puzzle that takes some uh kind of clearly calculable amount

34:40.800 --> 34:45.380
 of computational power to solve you get an identity and then you solve five of those

34:45.380 --> 34:50.580
 puzzles you get five identities and then these are the identities that we run the consensus

34:50.580 --> 34:55.920
 algorithm between so the proof of work mechanism you just described is like the fundamental

34:55.920 --> 35:05.040
 idea proposed in the in the white paper that defines bitcoin uh what's the idea of consensus

35:05.040 --> 35:15.800
 that we wish to reach why is consensus important here what is consensus so the goal here in

35:15.800 --> 35:22.640
 just simple technical terms is to basically kind of wire together a set of a large number

35:22.640 --> 35:27.280
 of computers in such a way that they kind of pretends to the outside world to be a single

35:27.280 --> 35:32.380
 computer where that single computer keeps working even if a large portion of the kind

35:32.380 --> 35:36.720
 of constituents the computers that make it up break and kind of break in arbitrary ways

35:36.720 --> 35:41.480
 like they could shut off they could try to actively break a system they could do lots

35:41.480 --> 35:49.780
 of mean things so the reason why the cypherpunks wanted to do this is because they wanted to

35:49.780 --> 35:54.240
 run one particular program on this virtual computer and the one particular program that

35:54.240 --> 35:58.880
 they wanted to run is just a currency system right it's a system that just processes a

35:58.880 --> 36:05.840
 series of transactions and for every transaction it verifies that the sender has enough coins

36:05.840 --> 36:10.080
 to pay for the transaction it verifies that the digital signature is correct and if the

36:10.080 --> 36:14.200
 checks pass then it subtracts the coins from one account and adds the coins to the other

36:14.200 --> 36:21.080
 account roughly so first of all the the the proof of work idea is kind of i mean at least

36:21.080 --> 36:27.800
 to me seems pretty fascinating it is i mean that's a it's kind of a revolutionary idea

36:27.800 --> 36:33.440
 i mean is is it is it obvious to come up with that you can use uh you can exchange basically

36:33.440 --> 36:41.800
 computational resources for for identity it's uh it actually has a pretty long history it

36:41.800 --> 36:51.320
 was uh first proposed in a paper by uh mc cynthia dwork and nixon naor in 1994 i believe

36:51.320 --> 36:55.960
 and the original use case was uh combating email spam so the idea is that if you send

36:55.960 --> 37:00.520
 an email you have to send it with a proof of work attached and like this makes it reasonably

37:00.520 --> 37:04.080
 cheap to send emails to your friends but it makes it really expensive to send spam to

37:04.080 --> 37:10.880
 a million people yeah that's a simple brilliant idea so maybe also taking a step back so what

37:10.880 --> 37:18.740
 is the role of blockchain in this what is the blockchain sure so the blockchain my way

37:18.740 --> 37:24.600
 of thinking about it is that it is this kind of system where you have this kind of one

37:24.600 --> 37:31.680
 virtual computer created by this a bunch of these nodes in the network and the reason

37:31.680 --> 37:37.080
 why the term blockchain is used is because the data structure that these systems use

37:37.080 --> 37:45.680
 at least so far is one where they um different nodes in the network periodically publish

37:45.680 --> 37:54.160
 blocks and a block is a kind of list of transactions together with a pointer like a hash of a previous

37:54.160 --> 38:01.320
 block that it builds on top of and so you have a series of blocks that that nodes in

38:01.320 --> 38:04.560
 the network create where each block points to the previous block and so you have this

38:04.560 --> 38:10.640
 chain of them is a fault tolerance mechanism built into the idea of blockchain or is it

38:10.640 --> 38:16.400
 a lot of possibilities of different ways to make sure there's no funny stuff going on

38:16.400 --> 38:22.220
 there are indeed a lot of possibilities um so in a kind of just simple architecture as

38:22.220 --> 38:26.880
 I just described the way the fault tolerance happens is like this right so you have a bunch

38:26.880 --> 38:30.520
 of nodes and they're just happily and have occasionally creating blocks building on top

38:30.520 --> 38:35.720
 of them each other's blocks and let's say you have kind of one block we'll call it kind

38:35.720 --> 38:41.000
 of block one and then someone else builds another block honestly you'll call it block

38:41.000 --> 38:46.320
 two then we have an attacker and what the attacker tries to do is the attacker tries

38:46.320 --> 38:50.640
 to revert block two and the way they revert block two is instead of doing the thing they're

38:50.640 --> 38:54.760
 supposed to do which is build a block on top of block two they're going to build another

38:54.760 --> 39:00.280
 block on top of block one um so you have block one which has two children block two and then

39:00.280 --> 39:07.240
 block two prime now this might sometimes even happen by random chance if you know two nodes

39:07.240 --> 39:10.920
 in the network just happen to create blocks at the same time and they don't hear about

39:10.920 --> 39:14.960
 each other's things before they create their own but this also could happen because of

39:14.960 --> 39:22.400
 an attack now if this happens you have an attack then the uh no in the bitcoin system

39:22.400 --> 39:30.520
 uh the nodes follow the longest chain um so if um this um attack had happened uh and when

39:30.520 --> 39:35.160
 the original chain had more than two blocks on it so if it was trying to kind of revert

39:35.160 --> 39:41.040
 more than more than two blocks then everyone would just would just ignore it and everyone

39:41.040 --> 39:44.480
 would just keep following the regular chain but here you know we have block two and we

39:44.480 --> 39:50.720
 have block two prime and so the two are kind of even and then whatever block um the next

39:50.720 --> 39:56.120
 block is created on top of so say block three is now created on top of block two prime then

39:56.120 --> 40:03.160
 everyone says uh agrees that block three is the new head um and block two prime is just

40:03.160 --> 40:06.740
 kind of forgotten and then everyone just kind of peacefully builds on top of block three

40:06.740 --> 40:12.640
 and the thing continues so how difficult is it to mess with the system right so how like

40:12.640 --> 40:19.040
 if we look at the general problem like how many what fraction of people who participate

40:19.040 --> 40:26.080
 in the system have to be bad players in order to mess with it truly like what's your is

40:26.080 --> 40:31.600
 there is there a good number there is um well depending on kind of what your model of the

40:31.600 --> 40:36.480
 participants is and like what kind of attack we're talking about it's anywhere between

40:36.480 --> 40:47.560
 23.2 and 50 of what of all of the computing power in the network sorry so 22 and 23 point

40:47.560 --> 40:58.200
 between 23.2 and 50 and 50 can be compromised so like once your once your your portion of

40:58.200 --> 41:04.120
 the total computing power in the network goes above the 23.2 level then there's kind of

41:04.120 --> 41:08.440
 things that you could mean things that you can potentially do and as your percentage

41:08.440 --> 41:12.740
 of the network kind of keeps going up then the your abilities as you mean things kind

41:12.740 --> 41:17.440
 of goes higher and then if you have above 50 then you can just break everything so how

41:17.440 --> 41:23.800
 how hard is it to achieve that level like it seems that so far historically speaking

41:23.800 --> 41:29.680
 it's been exceptionally difficult so this is a challenging question um so the economic

41:29.680 --> 41:36.680
 cost of acquiring that level of stuff from scratch is fairly high i think it's uh somewhere

41:36.680 --> 41:42.040
 in the low billions of dollars and when you say that stuff you mean computational resources

41:42.040 --> 41:48.200
 yeah so specifically specialized hardware and of asics that people use to solve these

41:48.200 --> 41:54.160
 puzzles to do the mining these days small tangent uh so obviously i work a lot in deep

41:54.160 --> 42:00.960
 learning with gpus and asics for that application and i tangentially kind of hear that so many

42:00.960 --> 42:07.360
 of these you know sometimes nvidia gpus are sold out because of this other application

42:07.360 --> 42:12.440
 like what do if you can comment i don't know if you're familiar or interested in this space

42:12.440 --> 42:18.520
 what kind of asics what kind of hardware is generally used these days for to do the actual

42:18.520 --> 42:23.440
 computation for the proof of work sure so in the case in bitcoin and ethereum are a

42:23.440 --> 42:28.960
 bit different so in the case of bitcoin there is an algorithm called sha256 it's just a

42:28.960 --> 42:33.880
 hash function and so the puzzle is just coming up with a number where the hash of the number

42:33.880 --> 42:38.880
 is below some threshold and so because the hashes are designed to be random you just

42:38.880 --> 42:45.040
 have to keep on trying different numbers until one works and the asics are just like specialized

42:45.040 --> 42:51.320
 circuits that contain and if circuits for evaluating this hash over and over again and

42:51.320 --> 42:56.240
 you have like millions or billions of these hash evaluators and just stacked on top of

42:56.240 --> 43:01.000
 each other inside of a box and you just keep on running the box 24 7 in the asics there's

43:01.000 --> 43:05.520
 literally specialized hardware designed for this yes oh this is a little bit an amazing

43:05.520 --> 43:11.560
 world another tangent i'll come back to the basics but uh does quantum computing throw

43:11.560 --> 43:19.080
 a wrench into any of this very good question so uh quantum computers have two main uh kind

43:19.080 --> 43:24.520
 of families of algorithms that are relevant to cryptography one is shor's algorithm and

43:24.520 --> 43:31.520
 shor's algorithm is one that kind of completely breaks the hardness of some specific kinds

43:31.520 --> 43:35.560
 of mathematical problems so the one that you've probably heard of is it makes it very easy

43:35.560 --> 43:41.280
 to factor numbers so figure out kind of what prime factors are the kind of that you need

43:41.280 --> 43:46.920
 to multiply together to get some number even if that number is extremely big shor's algorithm

43:46.920 --> 43:54.480
 can also be used to break elliptic curve cryptography it can break like any kind of hidden order

43:54.480 --> 44:00.320
 groups it breaks a lot of kind of cryptographic nice things that we're used to but the good

44:00.320 --> 44:07.720
 news is that for every kind of major use of things that shor's algorithm breaks we already

44:07.720 --> 44:12.680
 know of quantum proof alternatives right now we don't use these quantum proof alternatives

44:12.680 --> 44:20.280
 yet because in many cases they're five to ten times less efficient but the crypto industry

44:20.280 --> 44:25.580
 in general kind of knows that this is coming eventually and it's kind of ready to take

44:25.580 --> 44:31.680
 the hit and switch to that stuff when we when we have to the second algorithm that is relevant

44:31.680 --> 44:38.240
 to cryptography is grover's algorithm and in grover's algorithm might even be kind of

44:38.240 --> 44:44.520
 more familiar to ai people that's basically usually described as solving search problems

44:44.520 --> 44:51.600
 but the idea here is that if you have a problem of the form find a number that satisfies some

44:51.600 --> 44:58.840
 property then if with a classical computer you need to try and if n times before before

44:58.840 --> 45:03.800
 you find a number then with a quantum computer you only need to do square root of n computations

45:03.800 --> 45:12.840
 and grover's could potentially be used for mining but there's two possibilities here

45:12.840 --> 45:18.480
 one is that grover's could be used for mining and whoever creates the first working quantum

45:18.480 --> 45:22.800
 computer that could do grover's will just mine way faster than everyone else and we'll

45:22.800 --> 45:27.920
 see another round of what we saw when a6 came out which is that kind of the new hardware

45:27.920 --> 45:32.320
 just kind of dominated the old stuff and then eventually it switched to a new equilibrium

45:32.320 --> 45:37.680
 but by the way way faster not exponentially faster quadratically faster quadratically

45:37.680 --> 45:44.960
 faster which is not sort of it's not game changing i would say it's like a6 like you

45:44.960 --> 45:50.200
 said it would be exactly yeah so it would not necessarily break proof of work as a that's

45:50.200 --> 45:55.160
 right yeah now the other kind of possible world right is that quantum computers have

45:55.160 --> 46:00.440
 a lot of overhead there's a lot of a complexity involved in maintaining quantum states and

46:00.440 --> 46:07.600
 there's also as we've been realizing recently making quantum computers actually work requires

46:07.600 --> 46:12.200
 kind of quantum error correction which requires kind of a thousand real qubits per logical

46:12.200 --> 46:17.920
 qubit and so there's the very real possibility that the overhead of running a quantum computer

46:17.920 --> 46:22.540
 will be higher than the speed up you get with grover's which would be kind of sad but which

46:22.540 --> 46:28.220
 would also mean that the given proof of work will just keep working fine so beautifully

46:28.220 --> 46:33.640
 put so so proof of work is the core idea of bitcoin is there other core ideas before we

46:33.640 --> 46:39.160
 kind of take a step towards the origin story and ideas of ethereum is there other stuff

46:39.160 --> 46:43.880
 that were key to the white paper of bitcoin there is proof of work and then there's just

46:43.880 --> 46:49.880
 the cryptography is just kind of public keys and signatures that are used to verify transactions

46:49.880 --> 46:56.120
 those two are the big things so then what is the origin story maybe the human side but

46:56.120 --> 47:04.360
 also the technical side of ethereum sure so i joined the bitcoin community in 2011 and

47:04.360 --> 47:09.760
 i started by just writing i first wrote for this sort of online thing called bitcoin weekly

47:09.760 --> 47:16.500
 then i started writing for bitcoin magazine um and uh sorry to interrupt you have this

47:16.500 --> 47:24.440
 funny kind of uh story true or not is uh that you were disillusioned by the downsides of

47:24.440 --> 47:29.660
 centralized control from your experience with wow world of warcraft is this true or you're

47:29.660 --> 47:35.120
 just being witty uh i mean the event is true the fact that that's the reason i do decentralization

47:35.120 --> 47:42.640
 is witty maybe just a small tangent do have you always had a skepticism of centralized

47:42.640 --> 47:49.600
 control is that sort of degree yeah has that feeling evolved over time or has that just

47:49.600 --> 47:55.760
 always been a core feeling that decentralized control is the future of a human society it's

47:55.760 --> 47:59.920
 definitely been something that felt very attractive to me ever since i could have learned that

47:59.920 --> 48:05.440
 such a thing is possible it's possible even yeah so great so you're you joined the bitcoin

48:05.440 --> 48:12.800
 community in 2011 you said you began writing so what's next started writing uh moved from

48:12.800 --> 48:20.640
 high school to university halfway in between that and spent a year in university then at

48:20.640 --> 48:27.720
 the end of that year i dropped out to do bitcoin things full time and this was a combination

48:27.720 --> 48:33.360
 of continuing to write bitcoin magazine but also increasingly work on software projects

48:33.360 --> 48:37.760
 and i traveled around the world for about six months and just going to different bitcoin

48:37.760 --> 48:44.520
 communities like i went to first in new hampshire then spain other european places israel and

48:44.520 --> 48:48.880
 then san francisco and along the way i've met a lot of other people that are working

48:48.880 --> 48:54.600
 on different bitcoin projects and when i was in israel there were some very smart teams

48:54.600 --> 49:00.880
 there that were working on ideas that people were starting to kind of call bitcoin 2.0

49:00.880 --> 49:06.480
 so one of these were colored coins which is basically saying that hey let's not just use

49:06.480 --> 49:10.080
 the blockchain for bitcoin but let's also like kind of issue other kinds of assets on

49:10.080 --> 49:15.320
 it and then there was a protocol called master coin that supported issuing assets but also

49:15.320 --> 49:21.160
 supported many other things like financial contracts like domain name registration and

49:21.160 --> 49:30.920
 a lot of different things together and i spent some time working with these teams and i quickly

49:30.920 --> 49:36.480
 kind of realized that this master coin protocol could be improved by kind of generalizing

49:36.480 --> 49:40.480
 it more right so the best the analogy i use is that the master coin protocol was like

49:40.480 --> 49:46.880
 this swiss army knife you have 25 different transaction types for 25 different applications

49:46.880 --> 49:52.040
 but what i realized is that you could replace a bunch of them with things that are more

49:52.040 --> 49:57.960
 general purpose so one of them was that you could replace like three transaction types

49:57.960 --> 50:03.080
 for three types of financial contracts with a generic transaction type for a financial

50:03.080 --> 50:08.640
 contract that just lets you specify a mathematical formula for kind of who how much money each

50:08.640 --> 50:14.400
 side gets by the way it's a small pause what's you say financial contract just the terminology

50:14.400 --> 50:21.960
 what is the contract what's a financial contract so this is just generally an agreement where

50:21.960 --> 50:29.920
 kind of either one or two parties kind of put collateral kind of in and then they depending

50:29.920 --> 50:35.360
 on kind of certain conditions like this could involve prices of assets this could involve

50:35.360 --> 50:40.840
 the actions of the two parties it could involve other things but they kind of get different

50:40.840 --> 50:46.640
 amounts of of assets out that just depend on things that happened so a contract is really

50:46.640 --> 50:52.920
 a financial contract is at the core it's the it's the core interactive element of a financial

50:52.920 --> 50:57.600
 system yeah there's yeah there's many different kinds of financial contracts like there's

50:57.600 --> 51:02.000
 things like options where you kind of give someone the right to buy a thing that you

51:02.000 --> 51:08.120
 have for some specific price for some period of time there's uh contracts for difference

51:08.120 --> 51:13.520
 where you basically are kind of making a bet that says like for every dollar this thing

51:13.520 --> 51:16.720
 goes up i'll give you seven dollars or for every dollar that thing goes down you give

51:16.720 --> 51:21.840
 me seven dollars or something like that and but the main idea that these contracts have

51:21.840 --> 51:27.600
 to be enforced and trusted them yes exactly you have to trust that they will work out

51:27.600 --> 51:34.000
 in a system where nobody can be trusted yes this is such a beautiful complicated system

51:34.000 --> 51:40.640
 okay so uh so you were seeking to kind of generalize this basic uh framework of contracts

51:40.640 --> 51:48.320
 um so what does that entail so what what technically are the steps to creating ethereum

51:48.320 --> 51:54.880
 sure so i guess just to kind of continue a bit with this master coin story um so started

51:54.880 --> 52:00.720
 by kind of giving ideas for how to generalize the thing and eventually um this turned into

52:00.720 --> 52:04.800
 a much more kind of fully fledged proposal that just says hey how about you scrap all

52:04.800 --> 52:09.920
 your futures and instead you just um put in this programming language and i gave this

52:09.920 --> 52:16.640
 idea to them and their response was something like hey this is great but this seems complicated

52:16.640 --> 52:19.920
 and it seems like something that we're not going to be able to put onto our roadmap for

52:19.920 --> 52:24.480
 a while and my response to this was like wait do you not realize how revolutionary this

52:24.480 --> 52:29.840
 is well i'll just go do it myself and then i what was the name of the programming language

52:29.840 --> 52:37.920
 i just called it ultimate scripting great uh so then i kind of went through a couple

52:37.920 --> 52:43.520
 more rounds of iteration and then the idea for a theorem itself started to form

52:43.520 --> 52:51.440
 um and the idea here is that you just have a blockchain where the core unit of the thing

52:51.440 --> 52:57.600
 is what we call contracts it's these kind of accounts that can hold assets um and like

52:57.600 --> 53:03.680
 they have their own internal memory but that are controlled by a piece of code and so if

53:03.680 --> 53:09.280
 i send some ether to a contract the only thing that can determine where that kind of ether

53:10.000 --> 53:16.800
 the currency inside ethereum and it goes after that um is the code of that contract itself

53:16.800 --> 53:24.640
 and so basically kind of sending assets to computer programs becomes this kind of paradigm

53:24.640 --> 53:30.560
 for creating these sort of agreements self executing agreements self executing it's so

53:30.560 --> 53:36.480
 cool that code is sort of part of this contract so that that's what's meant by smart contracts

53:36.480 --> 53:43.040
 yeah so how hard was it to build this kind of thing harder than expected um and originally

53:43.040 --> 53:47.200
 i actually thought that this would be a thing that i would kind of casually work on for a

53:47.200 --> 53:55.200
 couple of months publish and then go back to university um then i released it and a bunch

53:55.200 --> 53:59.200
 of people or i released the white paper the white paper the idea is there the idea the

53:59.200 --> 54:03.840
 white paper um a whole bunch of people came in offering the help a huge number of people

54:03.840 --> 54:10.720
 and have expressed interest and this was something i was totally not expecting and then i kind of

54:10.720 --> 54:15.920
 realized that this would be something that's kind of much bigger than i had ever um thought

54:15.920 --> 54:23.280
 that it would be and then we started on this kind of much longer development slog of making

54:23.280 --> 54:28.800
 something that lives up to this sort of much higher level of expectations what are the some

54:28.800 --> 54:34.480
 of the is it fundamentally like software engineering challenges it was their social

54:34.480 --> 54:40.720
 okay so there's social so so what are the biggest interesting challenges that you've learned about

54:41.840 --> 54:45.600
 human civilization and in in software engineering through this process

54:47.280 --> 54:54.400
 so i guess one of the challenges for me is that like i'm one of the kind of apparently unusual

54:54.400 --> 54:59.440
 geek schoolers and i've never treated with anything but kindness in school yes um and so

55:00.160 --> 55:06.960
 when i got into crypto i kind of expected everyone would just kind of be the same kind

55:06.960 --> 55:14.800
 of altruistic and nice in that same way um but the um kind of the algorithm that i used for

55:14.800 --> 55:18.480
 finding cofounders for this thing was not very good it was sort of literally one computer

55:18.480 --> 55:23.440
 scientist called the greedy algorithm it's sort of the first 15 people who replied back offering

55:23.440 --> 55:29.200
 to help kind of are the cofounders oh you mean like literally the the the people that for will

55:29.200 --> 55:34.240
 form to be the the founders cofounders of the community the algorithm i like how you call it

55:34.240 --> 55:43.920
 the algorithm yeah um and so what happened was that uh these um like especially as the project

55:43.920 --> 55:48.320
 got really big like there started to be a lot of this kind of infighting and there were a lot of

55:48.320 --> 55:53.280
 like i wanted the thing to be a non profit and some of them wanted to be a for profit

55:53.280 --> 55:58.400
 uh and then there started to be people who were just kind of totally unable to work with each

55:58.400 --> 56:04.720
 other there were people that were kind of trying to get an advantage for themselves in a lot of

56:04.720 --> 56:12.320
 different ways and this uh just about six months later led to this big governance crisis and then

56:12.320 --> 56:18.720
 we kind of reshuffled leadership a bit and then uh the project kept on going then nine months

56:18.720 --> 56:23.760
 later there was another governance crisis and then there was a third governance crisis and so

56:23.760 --> 56:30.000
 is there a way to if you're looking at the human side of things is there a way to optimize this

56:30.000 --> 56:36.080
 aspect of the cryptocurrency world it seems that there is uh from my perspective there's a lot of

56:36.080 --> 56:43.520
 different characters and personalities and egos and like you said uh i don't know if you know i

56:43.520 --> 56:49.360
 also like to think that most of the world most of the people in the world are well intentioned

56:50.080 --> 56:56.640
 but the way those intentions are realized may perhaps come off as uh yeah as as negative like

56:56.640 --> 57:03.440
 what uh is there is there a hopeful message here about creating a governance structure for

57:03.440 --> 57:09.440
 cryptocurrency that uh where everyone gets along and after about four rounds of reshuffle like i

57:09.440 --> 57:16.160
 think we've actually come up with something that seems to be pretty stable and happy um i think uh

57:18.960 --> 57:25.600
 i mean i definitely do think that most people are well intentioned i just think that like one of the

57:25.600 --> 57:30.880
 reasons why i like decentralization is just because there's like this thing about power

57:30.880 --> 57:35.760
 where power attracts people with egos and so that just allows us a very small percentage of people

57:35.760 --> 57:44.000
 to just ruin so many things you think ego has a you think ego has a use like is ego always bad

57:44.560 --> 57:49.200
 it seems like sometimes does but then the ethereum research team i feel like we've found

57:50.160 --> 57:58.080
 also kind of a lot like a lot of very good people that are just kind of primarily just interested

57:58.080 --> 58:05.920
 in things for the technology and uh things seem to just generally be going quite well

58:06.720 --> 58:11.360
 yeah when you're when the focus and the passion is in the tech so on the so that's the human side

58:11.360 --> 58:16.400
 of things but the technology side like what have you learned what have been the biggest challenges

58:16.400 --> 58:25.040
 of bringing ethereum to life on the technology side so i think first of all just uh you know

58:25.040 --> 58:30.640
 there's like the first law of software development which is that when someone gives you a timetable

58:30.640 --> 58:35.600
 i switch the unit of time to the next largest unit of time and add one and like we basically

58:35.600 --> 58:44.800
 fell victim to that um and uh and so instead of taking like three months it ended up taking like

58:44.800 --> 58:51.200
 20 months to watch the thing um and that was just i think underestimating the sheer technical

58:51.200 --> 58:57.840
 complexity of the thing um there are research challenges like so for example one of the things

58:57.840 --> 59:02.240
 that we've been saying from the start that we would do one is a switch from a proof of work

59:02.240 --> 59:08.080
 to a proof of stake um where proof of stake is so this uh alternative consensus mechanism where

59:08.080 --> 59:13.040
 instead of having to waste a lot of computing power on solving these mathematical puzzles

59:13.040 --> 59:18.880
 that don't mean anything you kind of prove that you have access to coins inside of the system and

59:18.880 --> 59:23.600
 this uh then it gives you some level of participation in the consensus can you

59:23.600 --> 59:26.720
 maybe elaborate on that a little bit i understand the idea of proof of work

59:27.360 --> 59:32.320
 um i know that a lot of people say that the idea of proof of stake is really appealing can you

59:32.320 --> 59:41.840
 maybe linger on it longer explain what it is sure uh so basically the idea is like if i kind of lock

59:41.840 --> 59:49.680
 up a hundred coins then i turn that into a kind of quote virtual miner and the system itself kind

59:49.680 --> 59:56.560
 of automatically and randomly assigns that in a virtual miner the right to create blocks at

59:56.560 --> 1:00:02.000
 particular intervals and then if someone else has 200 coins and they walk on the walk there's 200

1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:07.200
 coins then they get a kind of twice as big virtual miner they'll be able to create blocks twice as

1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:15.040
 often so it tries to kind of do similar things to proof of work except instead of the thing

1:00:15.040 --> 1:00:22.000
 and of rate limiting your participation being your ability to crank out solutions to kind of

1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:26.240
 hash challenges the thing that really limits your participation is kind of how much coins you're

1:00:26.240 --> 1:00:31.600
 kind of locking into this mechanism okay so interesting so that that limited participation

1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:42.640
 doesn't require you to run a lot of compute does that mean that the richer you are so rich people

1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:53.200
 um are more like their identities more right and this stable yeah verifiable or whatever

1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:58.880
 whatever the right terminology is right and this is definitely a common critique i think my usual

1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:04.000
 answer to this is that like proof of work is even more of that kind of system exactly yeah because

1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:08.000
 i didn't mean it and that statement is a criticism i think you're exactly right that's equivalent

1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:14.320
 the proof of work is the same kind of thing but in the proof of work you have to also use physical

1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:21.360
 resources yes and burn computers and burn trees and all of that stuff is there um a way to mess

1:01:21.360 --> 1:01:27.920
 with the system of the proof of uh proof of stake there is but you will once again need to have a

1:01:27.920 --> 1:01:32.080
 very large portion of all the coins that are locked in the system to do anything bad got it

1:01:33.360 --> 1:01:38.800
 yeah and just that maybe take a small tangent one of the criticisms of cryptocurrency is the fact

1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:44.080
 that i guess for the proof of work mechanism you have to use so much energy in the world

1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:51.040
 yes is one of the motivations of proof of stake is to move away from this definitely like what's

1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:57.040
 your sense of the uh maybe i'm just under informed is there like legitimately environmental impact

1:01:57.040 --> 1:02:04.080
 from this yeah uh so the latest thing was that bitcoin consumed as much energy as the country of

1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:09.280
 austria or something like that yeah and then ethereum is like right now maybe only like

1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:15.120
 half in order of magnitude smaller than bitcoin i've heard you talk about ethereum 2.0 so what's

1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:22.400
 the what's the dream of ethereum 2.0 what's the the status of proof of stake is the mechanism that

1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:28.800
 ethereum moves towards and also how do you move to a different mechanism of consensus

1:02:29.840 --> 1:02:36.400
 within a cryptocurrency so ethereum 2.0 is a collection of major upgrades that we've wanted

1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:42.480
 to do to ethereum for quite some time the two big ones uh one is a proof of stake and the other is

1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:48.000
 what we call sharding um sharding solves another problem with blockchains which is a scalability

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:54.480
 and what sharding does is it basically says instead of every participant in the network

1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:59.440
 having to personally download and verify every transaction every participant in the network only

1:02:59.440 --> 1:03:04.000
 downloads and verifies a small portion of transactions and then you kind of randomly

1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:11.120
 distribute who gets how much work um and because of how the distribution is random it still has the

1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:16.160
 property that you need a large portion of the entire network to corrupt what's going on inside

1:03:16.160 --> 1:03:23.680
 of any shard but the system is still in a very redundant and very secure that's brilliant how

1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:30.480
 hard is that to implement and how hard is uh proof of stake to implement like on the technical level

1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:35.840
 yeah software level proof of stake and sharding are both challenging um i'd say sharding is a bit

1:03:35.840 --> 1:03:40.640
 more challenging the reason is that proof of stake is kind of just a change to the how the

1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:46.800
 consensus layer works sharding does both that but it's also a change to the networking layer

1:03:46.800 --> 1:03:50.960
 um the reason is that sharding is kind of pointless if at the networking layer you still

1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:55.680
 do what you do today which is you kind of gossip everything which means that if someone publishes

1:03:55.680 --> 1:04:01.200
 something every other node and the client hears it like from uh on the networking layer and so

1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:05.360
 instead we have to have kind of subnetworks and the ability to quickly switch between subnetworks

1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:11.040
 and have the subnetworks talk to each other and this is all doable but it's a more complex

1:04:11.040 --> 1:04:15.040
 architecture and it's definitely the sort of thing that hasn't not yet been done in cryptocurrency

1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:21.200
 so most most of the networking layer in uh cryptocurrency is you're shouting you're like

1:04:21.200 --> 1:04:26.800
 broadcasting messages and this is more like ad hoc networks like yeah you're shouting within

1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:31.760
 smaller groups smaller group but you have like a bunch of subnet like exactly then you have to

1:04:31.760 --> 1:04:38.720
 switch between oh man i'd love to see the uh so it's a beautiful idea uh so from a graph

1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:44.320
 theoretical perspective but just the software that like who's responsible is the ethereum

1:04:44.960 --> 1:04:48.880
 project like the people involved would they be implementing like what's the actual

1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:56.080
 you know this is like legit software engineering uh who like how does that work how do people

1:04:56.080 --> 1:05:02.880
 collaborate build that kind of project is this like almost um like is there a software engineering

1:05:02.880 --> 1:05:08.960
 lead is there it's like is it a legit almost like large scale open source project there is

1:05:08.960 --> 1:05:14.160
 yeah so um we have uh someone named uh danny ryan on our team who's just been brilliant and

1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:22.800
 great all around and he is a kind of de facto kind of development coordinator i guess it's like you

1:05:22.800 --> 1:05:28.480
 have to invent job titles for this stuff the reason is that um like we also have this unique

1:05:28.480 --> 1:05:32.560
 kind of organizational structure where the ethereum foundation itself kind of does research

1:05:32.560 --> 1:05:37.680
 in house but then the actual implementation is done by independent teams that are separate

1:05:37.680 --> 1:05:44.640
 companies and they're located all around the world and like fun places like australia and and

1:05:44.640 --> 1:05:51.840
 and so uh you know you kind of just need a bunch of kind of almost nonstop cat herding to just

1:05:52.400 --> 1:05:57.840
 keep getting these people to kind of talk to each other and kind of implement this back make sure

1:05:57.840 --> 1:06:02.080
 that everyone agrees on kind of what what's going on and kind of how to interpret different things

1:06:02.960 --> 1:06:08.080
 so how far into the future are we from these two mechanisms in ethereum 2.0 like what's what's your

1:06:08.080 --> 1:06:15.200
 sense of the timeline keeping in mind the previous comment you made about the sort of uh general

1:06:16.160 --> 1:06:24.720
 curse of software projects so ethereum 2.0 is split into three phases so phase zero just

1:06:24.720 --> 1:06:30.080
 creates a proof stake network and it's actually separate from kind of proof of uh the proof of

1:06:30.080 --> 1:06:34.960
 work network at the beginning just to kind of give it time to grow and improve itself

1:06:34.960 --> 1:06:39.200
 do people get to choose sorry to interrupt do people get to choose i guess yes they get they

1:06:39.200 --> 1:06:45.280
 get to choose to move over if they want to then phase one adds sharding but it only adds sharding

1:06:45.280 --> 1:06:51.520
 of data storage and not sharding of computation and then after that there is kind of the merger

1:06:51.520 --> 1:06:58.960
 phase which is where the uh and if the accounts uh kind of smart contracts like all of the activity

1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:04.480
 and uh the existing eth1 system just kind of gets cut and pasted into eth2 and then the proof of

1:07:04.480 --> 1:07:09.760
 work chain gets forgotten and then and things all the things that were living there before just

1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:18.080
 kind of continue living inside of the proof of stake system so for timelines um phase zero has

1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:26.960
 been uh kind of almost fully implemented um and now it's just a matter of uh a whole bunch of

1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:33.280
 security auditing and testing um my own experience is that right now it feels like we're at about a

1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:40.720
 phase comparable to when we were doing uh the original ethereum launch when we were maybe about

1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:47.440
 four months away from launch so that's just a hunch then that's just a hunch yeah so how you

1:07:47.440 --> 1:07:54.080
 know it took it took like over a decade for people to move from python 2 to python 3 uh how do you see

1:07:54.720 --> 1:08:01.600
 the move from like this phase zero of for for different consensus mechanism do you see there

1:08:01.600 --> 1:08:09.280
 being a a drastic phase shift in people just kind of jumping to this better mechanism so in phase

1:08:09.280 --> 1:08:15.520
 zero i don't expect too many people to do much because in phase zero in phase one the new chain

1:08:15.520 --> 1:08:20.400
 the get of deliberately enough doesn't have too much functionality turned on it's there just like

1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:24.800
 if you want to be a proof of stake validator you can get things started if you want to store data

1:08:24.800 --> 1:08:30.400
 for other blockchain applications you can get started but existing applications will largely

1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:38.160
 keep living on eth1 and then when the merger happens then the merger is a operation that

1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:43.520
 happens all at once so that's kind of one of the benefits of a consensus system that like on the

1:08:43.520 --> 1:08:47.680
 one hand you have to coordinate the upgrade but on the other hand the upgrade can be coordinated

1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:56.640
 so what's casper ffg by the way um casper ffg is the consensus algorithm that we are using for

1:08:56.640 --> 1:09:01.200
 the proof of stake is there something interesting uh specific about casper ffg

1:09:01.200 --> 1:09:09.200
 like some beautiful aspect of it that's uh there is so casper ffg combines together kind of two

1:09:09.200 --> 1:09:14.800
 different schools of a consensus algorithm design uh so the general two different schools of the

1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:23.040
 of this design are right one is uh 50 fault tolerant but dependent on network synchrony

1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:30.240
 so 50 fault tolerant but it didn't tolerate up to 50 of faults but not more but it depends on

1:09:30.240 --> 1:09:34.640
 an assumption that all of the nodes can talk uh talk to each other within some

1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:39.040
 kind of limited period of time like if i send the message you'll receive it within a few seconds

1:09:40.320 --> 1:09:47.200
 and the second school is 33 fault tolerant but safe under asynchrony which means that

1:09:47.200 --> 1:09:53.360
 like if we agree on something then that thing is finalized and even if the network goes horribly

1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:59.440
 wonky the second after that thing is finalized there's no way to revert that thing um and that's

1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:06.720
 fascinating how you would make that happen it's uh definitely quite clever um i'd recommend the

1:10:06.720 --> 1:10:12.880
 uh casper ffg paper if you just search like archive as in like arxiv casper ffg it's that's

1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:18.480
 that's an archive the paper is an archive yeah yeah who are the authors um myself and uh virgil

1:10:18.480 --> 1:10:25.600
 griffith that's awesome i take a small tangent this idea of just putting out white papers and

1:10:25.600 --> 1:10:30.720
 papers and putting them on archive and just putting them publicly is that is that at the core

1:10:31.840 --> 1:10:38.240
 is that a necessary component of the currency is that the tradition started with uh uh satoshi

1:10:38.240 --> 1:10:42.320
 nakamoto's what do you make of it like what do you make of the future of that kind of sharing of

1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:50.640
 ideas i guess so yeah and it's definitely something that's kind of mandatory for crypto because like

1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:56.160
 crypto is all about making systems where you know you don't have to trust the operators to

1:10:56.160 --> 1:11:02.080
 trust that the thing works and so if anything behind our system works is closed sourced and

1:11:02.080 --> 1:11:09.680
 that kind of uh kills the point and so there is the kind of a sense in which the fundamental

1:11:09.680 --> 1:11:14.640
 properties of the category of the thing we're trying to build just kind of forces openness

1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:19.680
 but also openness just has proven to be a really great way to collaborate and then there's actually

1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:24.640
 had a lot of kind of innovation and academic collaboration that's just kind of happened

1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:31.280
 ad hoc in the crypto space the last few years so like for example we have this forum called

1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:40.000
 eth research that's like e th r e s e a r and then dot ch um and there we publish kind of just

1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:46.640
 ideas in a form that's kind of half formal like it's halfway in between like it's it's a kind of

1:11:46.640 --> 1:11:52.480
 a text write up and then you can have math in it but it's often and of much shorter than a paper

1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:58.880
 and it turns out that the great majority of new ideas like they're just kind of fairly small

1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:03.360
 nuggets that you can explain in like five to ten lines and they don't really they don't need the

1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:08.400
 whole formality of a paper exactly they don't require the kind of like 10 pages of a filler

1:12:08.400 --> 1:12:15.040
 and so introduction conclusion is not needed yeah and so instead you just kind of publish the idea

1:12:15.040 --> 1:12:20.160
 and then people can go comments on it and that's brilliant yeah this has been great for us i think

1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:26.560
 i interrupted you was there something else on casper ffg that's just casper ffg is just kind

1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:35.920
 of combines together these two schools um and so basically it creates this system where if you have

1:12:36.720 --> 1:12:44.080
 more than 50 that are honest then and you have network synchrony then the thing kind of goes

1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:48.640
 as a chain but then if network synchrony fails then kind of the last few blocks in the chain

1:12:48.640 --> 1:12:54.880
 might um kind of get replaced but anything that was finalized by this kind of more asynchronous

1:12:54.880 --> 1:13:02.320
 process uh gets uh can't be reverted and so you essentially get a kind of best of both worlds

1:13:02.320 --> 1:13:07.600
 between those two models okay so i know what i'm doing tonight i'm going to be reading the casper

1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:15.760
 fg paper uh apologize for the romanticized question but what to you are some or the most

1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:21.360
 beautiful idea in the world of ethereum just something uh surprising something beautiful

1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:27.360
 something powerful yeah i mean i think the fact that money can just emerge out of a database if

1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:33.840
 enough people believe in it i think is definitely one of those things that's up there um i think one

1:13:33.840 --> 1:13:39.520
 of the things that i really love about ethereum is also this concept of composability so this is the

1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:45.760
 idea that like if i build an application on top of ethereum then you can build an application that

1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:51.360
 talks to my application and you don't even need my permission you don't even need to talk to me

1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:57.440
 right so one really fun example of this is there was this game on ethereum called crypto kitties

1:13:57.440 --> 1:14:03.520
 that just involved kind of breeding digital cats yes and someone else created a game called crypto

1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:08.720
 dragons where the way you play crypto dragons is you have a dragon and you have to feed it crypto

1:14:08.720 --> 1:14:17.840
 kitties um and they just uh created the whole thing just like as an ethereum contract that you

1:14:17.840 --> 1:14:23.920
 would send these uh these tokens that are defined by this other ethereum contract and for the

1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:29.360
 interoperability to happen like the projects didn't don't really need to like the teams don't

1:14:29.360 --> 1:14:35.040
 really need to talk to each other you just kind of interface with the existing program so it's

1:14:35.040 --> 1:14:39.200
 arbitrarily composable in this kind of way so you have different uh you know different groups that

1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:44.320
 could be working and so you could see it scaling to just outside of dragons and kitties it could

1:14:44.320 --> 1:14:50.480
 be you could build like entire ecosystems of software yeah and in the i mean especially in

1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:56.320
 the decentralized finance space that's been popping up the last two years there has been

1:14:56.320 --> 1:15:02.160
 a huge amount of really interesting things happen as a result of this is a particular kind of like

1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:08.080
 financial applications kind of thing yeah i mean there's like stable coins so this is a kind of

1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:16.160
 tokens that retain a value equal to one dollar but they're kind of backed by a crypt uh cryptocurrency

1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:22.640
 um then there's decentralized exchanges um so when as far as the decentralized exchanges goes

1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:29.520
 there's this uh really interesting construction that um has existed for about one and one and a

1:15:29.520 --> 1:15:37.200
 half years now called uniswap so what uniswap is it's a smart contract that holds the balances of

1:15:37.200 --> 1:15:42.720
 two tokens we'll call them token a and token b and it maintains an invariance that the balance

1:15:42.720 --> 1:15:47.680
 of token a multiplied by the balance of token b has to equal the same value and so the way that

1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:53.280
 you trade against the thing is basically like you have this kind of curve you know like x times y

1:15:53.280 --> 1:15:58.800
 equals k and yeah before you trade it's at some points on the curve after you trade you just like

1:15:58.800 --> 1:16:03.520
 pick some different any to any other points on the curve and then whatever the delta x is that's the

1:16:03.520 --> 1:16:08.080
 amount of a tokens you provide whatever the delta y is that's the amount of b tokens you get or vice

1:16:08.080 --> 1:16:14.720
 versa and that's just and then kind of the slope at the current points on the curve kind of is the

1:16:14.720 --> 1:16:24.720
 price um and so that just is the whole thing and that just allows you to have this exchange for

1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:32.800
 tokens and even if there's very few participants and the whole thing is just like so simple and

1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:39.280
 it's just very easy to set up very easy to participate in and it just provides so much value

1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:48.160
 to people so and uh the uh the fundamental the the distributed application infrastructure allows

1:16:48.160 --> 1:16:53.680
 that somehow yes so this is a smart contract meeting this is all a computer program that's

1:16:53.680 --> 1:17:01.040
 just running on ethereum smart contracts too are just fascinating they are okay do you think

1:17:01.040 --> 1:17:06.880
 cryptocurrency may become the main currency in the world one day so where do you think we're headed

1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:14.160
 in terms of the role of currency the structure type of currency in the world i definitely expect

1:17:14.160 --> 1:17:20.560
 um fiat currencies to continue to exist and continue to be strong and i definitely expect

1:17:20.560 --> 1:17:25.040
 kind of fiat currencies to also digitize in their own way over the next couple of decades what's

1:17:25.040 --> 1:17:31.120
 fiat currency by the way oh just like things like us dollars and like dollars and euros and yen and

1:17:31.120 --> 1:17:36.640
 these other things and they're sort of backed by governments yes but i also expect kind of

1:17:36.640 --> 1:17:43.120
 cryptocurrencies to play this kind of important role in just making sure that people always have

1:17:43.120 --> 1:17:51.280
 an alternative if fiat currencies start breaking so like if or if you're in you know some very

1:17:51.280 --> 1:18:00.800
 high inflation place like venice will for example or if uh your country just kind of gets cut off

1:18:01.440 --> 1:18:06.400
 from um cut off from other financial systems because of like something the banks do

1:18:06.400 --> 1:18:13.280
 uh if any kind of if there's even like some major trade disruption or something worse happens then

1:18:14.160 --> 1:18:18.800
 like cryptocurrencies are the sort of thing that just because of their kind of global neutrality

1:18:18.800 --> 1:18:23.600
 they're just kind of always there and you can keep using them it's interesting that you're quite

1:18:23.600 --> 1:18:29.120
 humble about the possibilities of the future of cryptocurrency you don't think there's a possible

1:18:29.120 --> 1:18:38.000
 future where it becomes the main set of currency because it feels like it feels like the centralized

1:18:38.560 --> 1:18:45.920
 control by governments of currency is limiting somehow maybe my naive utopian view of the world

1:18:45.920 --> 1:18:53.920
 it's uh i mean it's definitely very possible uh i mean i think like for cryptocurrencies being

1:18:53.920 --> 1:19:04.080
 the main form of value to kind of work well like you do need to have some much more price stability

1:19:04.080 --> 1:19:08.640
 than they have today and i mean there are now stable coins and there are kind of cryptic

1:19:08.640 --> 1:19:13.520
 cryptocurrencies that try to be more stable than existing things like bitcoin and ether but

1:19:13.520 --> 1:19:19.520
 and that just is to me the kind of the main challenge do you think oh that's do you think

1:19:19.520 --> 1:19:25.280
 that's a characteristic of this just being the early days it's such a young concept the 10 years

1:19:25.280 --> 1:19:31.200
 is nothing in the history of money yeah and i think it's a combination of two things right one

1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:37.520
 is um it's uh uh it's still early days but the other is a kind of more durable any kind of

1:19:37.520 --> 1:19:42.880
 economic problem which is that like demand for currency is volatile right because of like

1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:49.360
 recessions booms changes to technology lots of things and if people's demand for how much

1:19:49.360 --> 1:19:54.640
 currency they want to hold changes and if you have a currency that has a fixed supply

1:19:54.640 --> 1:20:00.400
 then the change in demand has to be entirely expressed as a change in value of the currency

1:20:00.400 --> 1:20:04.960
 and so what that means is that kind of the volatility of demand becomes entirely translated

1:20:04.960 --> 1:20:10.720
 into volatility and ahead of prices of things that dominated in that currency but if you have

1:20:10.720 --> 1:20:15.840
 a currency where instead the supply can change and so the supply can kind of go up when there's

1:20:15.840 --> 1:20:22.000
 more demand then you have the supply and of absorbing more of that volatility and so the

1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:26.640
 price of the currency would absorb less of the volatility on that topic so bitcoin does have a

1:20:26.640 --> 1:20:33.920
 limited supply a specific fixed supply yes uh what's what's the idea and ethereum doesn't but

1:20:33.920 --> 1:20:41.520
 can you clarify just in the comments you just made is ethereum qualify to the kind of currency

1:20:41.520 --> 1:20:46.000
 that you're talking about and being flexible in the supply i mean it's a bit more flexible but

1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:52.800
 kind of the thing that you would really want is something that's kind of specifically flexible

1:20:53.520 --> 1:21:00.560
 in response to how valuable the currency is and and i'd recommend you to look at stable coins

1:21:00.560 --> 1:21:07.840
 as well so like things like die for example it's a new like how you spell that da i and what uh

1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:14.160
 what's stable coins is it a type of cryptocurrency it is a type of cryptocurrency it's um a type of

1:21:14.160 --> 1:21:21.040
 cryptocurrency that's issued by a smart contract one of these ethereum computer programs that um

1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:27.360
 where the smart contract holds a bunch of ether and then it is basically like that people deposit

1:21:27.360 --> 1:21:32.160
 and then it issues die and the reason why people deposit is because they want to kind of go high

1:21:32.160 --> 1:21:37.040
 leverage on their ether and so it kind of pairs these two sets of users one that wants stability

1:21:37.040 --> 1:21:44.480
 and one that kind of wants extra risk together with each other and it basically creates some

1:21:45.520 --> 1:21:52.240
 or gives one set of participants a guarantee that they'll be that they have this asset that can

1:21:52.240 --> 1:21:56.640
 that can be later converted back into ether but and like specifically at kind of the one dollar

1:21:56.640 --> 1:22:03.440
 rate and it has some kind of uh stabilizing network effects yeah it has this yeah it has

1:22:03.440 --> 1:22:08.800
 many kinds of stabilizing mechanisms in it that's fascinating okay this is this world is awesome

1:22:08.800 --> 1:22:14.160
 technically just from a scientific perspective is an awesome world uh that i i often don't see from

1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:21.600
 an outsider's perspective what i often see is kind of uh maybe hype and a little bit if i may say so

1:22:21.600 --> 1:22:28.080
 like charlatanism and you don't often see at least from my outsider's perspective the beautiful

1:22:28.080 --> 1:22:35.920
 science of it and the engineering of it i mean maybe is there a comment you can make of who to

1:22:35.920 --> 1:22:45.040
 follow how to learn about this world without being um interrupted by the charlatans and the hype

1:22:45.040 --> 1:22:51.760
 people in this space i think you do need to just know the specific kind of just people to follow

1:22:51.760 --> 1:22:57.760
 like there's you know there's all the kind of the cryptographers and the researchers and there's

1:22:57.760 --> 1:23:03.840
 just like even just the ethereum research crew like myself you know like dan grad danny justin

1:23:03.840 --> 1:23:11.680
 and of the other people were and then and of the academic cryptographers and like before um

1:23:12.400 --> 1:23:18.080
 this today i was at stanford and stanford has the center for blockchain research and of dan bonet

1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:25.680
 this and really a famous and great cryptographer um was uh running it and there's a lot of other

1:23:25.680 --> 1:23:33.360
 people there and there's people working on zero knowledge proofs for example and um zuko from

1:23:33.360 --> 1:23:41.840
 zcash has one other person that i respect so i think if you follow the technical you crawl along

1:23:41.840 --> 1:23:45.680
 that yeah yeah you just start with the theory group and then look at the academics day bonet

1:23:45.680 --> 1:23:51.520
 and so on and then just cautiously expand the network of people you follow yeah exactly and

1:23:51.520 --> 1:23:57.600
 like if someone seems too too self promotional then just like remove them is there books

1:23:58.320 --> 1:24:03.680
 that are so there's these white papers and we just discussed about about ideas being

1:24:03.680 --> 1:24:08.240
 condensed into really small parts is there books that are emerging that are kind of

1:24:09.200 --> 1:24:15.360
 good uh introductory material so for historical ones and there's like nathaniel popper's digital

1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:20.720
 gold which is just about the history of bitcoin there's like one and then matthew leising announced

1:24:20.720 --> 1:24:26.320
 that there's one about the history of ethereum um for technical ones and there's andreas hansenopoulos

1:24:26.320 --> 1:24:33.360
 is mastering ethereum great so um let me ask you sort of uh sorry to to pull back to the

1:24:35.280 --> 1:24:38.240
 the idea of governments and decentralized currency

1:24:40.800 --> 1:24:46.240
 you know there's a tension between decentralization of currency and the power of nations

1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:53.920
 um the power of governments you um what's your sense about that tension can is there some rule

1:24:53.920 --> 1:25:02.720
 for regulation of currency you yeah is there like is the government the enemy of digital currency

1:25:02.720 --> 1:25:11.120
 of distributed currency or can they be like cautious friends i mean i think like

1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:17.520
 like the one thing that people forget is that it's clearly not entirely an enemy because i think

1:25:18.400 --> 1:25:27.360
 if uh there hadn't been so much government regulation on and if centralized uh issuing

1:25:27.360 --> 1:25:32.880
 centralized digital currencies then i like we'd be seeing things people like google and facebook

1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:37.280
 and twitter just kind of issuing them left and right and then like if that was the case then

1:25:37.280 --> 1:25:41.120
 decentralized currencies would still appeal to some people but they definitely would appeal to

1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:49.600
 less people than today so even in that sense i think it's uh clearly been kind of more of a help

1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:56.240
 just kind of set the stage for the end of the existence as a of the sector in some ways but

1:25:57.040 --> 1:26:03.280
 also and i think some of both you know like there's definitely things that governments

1:26:03.280 --> 1:26:10.240
 and if can do in some cases have done to have hurt the spread of uh and of growth of uh of

1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:17.200
 blockchains there's uh things that they've done to help and they've uh in some cases definitely done

1:26:17.200 --> 1:26:23.440
 a good job of kind of going after fraudulent projects and going after some of the projects

1:26:23.440 --> 1:26:30.160
 that have some of the kind of craziest and most misleading marketing um there's uh also the

1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:35.920
 possibility that governments will end up using blockchains for a lot of different things like

1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:40.320
 you know governments yeah i mean they do a lot more than just regulating right like there's also

1:26:40.960 --> 1:26:49.680
 like they have the kind of identity records and they have kind of like property registries

1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:56.240
 even just their own currency is like secure like lots of different kind of things that they're

1:26:56.240 --> 1:27:02.400
 operating and there's even blockchain applications in a lot of those yeah and they can you know they

1:27:02.400 --> 1:27:08.480
 can leverage technology do a lot of good for our societies it is a little unfortunate that

1:27:08.480 --> 1:27:14.560
 governments often lag behind in terms of their acceptance and leverage of technology if you look

1:27:14.560 --> 1:27:22.160
 at the autonomous vehicle space ai in general they're uh they're a few years behind it'd be

1:27:22.160 --> 1:27:29.280
 nice uh to help them catch up that's a that's that's a always ongoing problem you um met

1:27:29.280 --> 1:27:35.440
 vladimir putin to discuss the centralized currency here you're born in the where were you born

1:27:35.440 --> 1:27:44.320
 columbia it's a city about 115 kilometers south of moscow in russia yes yeah i grew up in moscow

1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:49.360
 i mean that's vladimir putin is a is a central figure in this part of the world so what was

1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:56.240
 that like meeting or meeting him what was that experience like he's taller in photos than in

1:27:56.240 --> 1:28:07.120
 person yeah he's yeah that's right he's 57 i think 58 maybe yeah that's uh unfortunately we

1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:11.920
 didn't actually kind of have too much of a chance to talk to him like i managed to see him for about

1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:17.600
 one minute at the end of this meeting and i did get a chance to see a lot like some of the other

1:28:17.600 --> 1:28:24.240
 end of government ministers and like he recommended some and uh some of them are are actually

1:28:24.240 --> 1:28:30.880
 kind of interested in trying to use um like blockchains to like for various government

1:28:30.880 --> 1:28:36.640
 use cases they kind of limit corruption and other things and i have like it's hard to tell from one

1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:41.360
 conversation kind of what things are genuine and what things are just like oh blockchain is cool

1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:48.640
 let's do blockchain right but you know when i when i listen to like um barack obama talk about

1:28:48.640 --> 1:28:55.680
 artificial intelligence there's certain things i hear where okay so he might not be an expert in

1:28:55.680 --> 1:29:02.160
 ai but he know he like actually studied it carefully enough to think about it like he

1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:08.080
 internally like uh even if he's just reading a wikipedia page like he really thought about what

1:29:08.080 --> 1:29:15.040
 this technology means did you get a sense that uh putin or some of the ministers like thought about

1:29:15.040 --> 1:29:19.680
 blockchain like thought about the fundamentals of technical like understand it intuitively

1:29:19.680 --> 1:29:26.720
 are they too old school to try to grasp it some are old school some are more new school

1:29:26.720 --> 1:29:31.680
 it depends it's it's definitely like depends on who you talk to i mean that's an open question

1:29:31.680 --> 1:29:37.680
 for me with putin because putin has said i don't know i've only talked to him for about one minute

1:29:37.680 --> 1:29:44.720
 so but sometimes you can pick up sort of insights there's a quick comment there they're about maybe

1:29:44.720 --> 1:29:50.960
 you can correct me on this but they're about 3000 cryptocurrencies being actively traded yes uh and

1:29:50.960 --> 1:29:56.080
 ethereum is one of you know a lot of people believe that there will be the the main cryptocurrency i

1:29:56.080 --> 1:30:00.800
 think bitcoin is currently still the main cryptocurrency but ethereum very likely might

1:30:00.800 --> 1:30:07.520
 become that the the main one um is this kind of diversity good in the crypto world do you see it

1:30:07.520 --> 1:30:12.800
 sticking around should there should there be a winner like should there be some consensus globally

1:30:12.800 --> 1:30:18.320
 around uh bitcoin or around ethereum like what's your what's your sense i definitely think the

1:30:18.320 --> 1:30:23.840
 diversity is good and i definitely think also that there's probably too many people trying to

1:30:23.840 --> 1:30:29.040
 make separate blockchains kind of right now the number should definitely be greater than one and

1:30:29.040 --> 1:30:35.280
 probably greater than two or even five um not three thousand not three thousand yeah and also

1:30:35.280 --> 1:30:40.320
 not even like 40 high quality platforms that try to do the same thing i mean there's definitely

1:30:40.320 --> 1:30:48.240
 this range from just like one person who just like wrongly thinks that you can create a cryptocurrency

1:30:48.240 --> 1:30:53.680
 in like 12 hours and uh doesn't even think about kind of the community aspects of maintaining it

1:30:53.680 --> 1:31:01.280
 going to uh people actually trying but only creating a really tiny one to like scammers

1:31:01.280 --> 1:31:09.440
 to people like making something that's actually successful and then there's a lot of different

1:31:09.440 --> 1:31:13.120
 categories of blockchain and you have project in terms of what it's trying to do and what

1:31:13.120 --> 1:31:18.560
 applications it's for um and i think the experimentation is definitely healthy

1:31:18.560 --> 1:31:24.160
 if you look at the two worlds it might be a little bit disjoint but uh the distributed

1:31:24.160 --> 1:31:29.440
 applications cryptocurrency and then the world of artificial intelligence do you see there's some

1:31:29.440 --> 1:31:36.560
 overlap between these worlds that both worry about centralized control is there some overlap that's

1:31:36.560 --> 1:31:42.800
 interesting that you think about do you think about ai much yeah and i think uh definitely

1:31:42.800 --> 1:31:48.640
 i'd have thought about things like in like the ai and if control problems and alignment problems and

1:31:48.640 --> 1:31:52.800
 all of those things do you worry about the existential threat of ai it's definitely one

1:31:52.800 --> 1:32:01.520
 of the things i worry about they think um block there's a lot of uh kind of common challenges

1:32:01.520 --> 1:32:07.600
 because in in both cases what you're ultimately trying to do is you're trying to kind of get a

1:32:07.600 --> 1:32:14.240
 simple system to direct a more complex system like in the case of uh this is drawing ai's the

1:32:14.240 --> 1:32:20.080
 idea would be that the simple system is people and the complex system is well whatever um thing

1:32:20.080 --> 1:32:24.240
 uh the people uh the people end up kind of unleashing on the universe that'll hopefully be

1:32:24.240 --> 1:32:31.920
 a great thing um and in the case of blockchains and of the complex well the simple thing is uh

1:32:32.400 --> 1:32:36.800
 the algorithm which is a piece of static and fully open source code and the more complex thing is

1:32:36.800 --> 1:32:44.640
 just the all of the different possible kind of human actors and the end of the strategy is that

1:32:44.640 --> 1:32:50.960
 they might end up used to participate in the network do you think about your own mortality

1:32:50.960 --> 1:32:56.400
 like what you hope to accomplish in your life oh i definitely i definitely think about ending my

1:32:56.400 --> 1:33:03.440
 own mortality so that's if i gave you the option to live forever would you depends a lot on what

1:33:03.440 --> 1:33:08.720
 the fine birds is but i mean you know if it's one of those things where i'm going to be kind

1:33:08.720 --> 1:33:16.880
 of like floating through empty space for 10 to the 75 years then no if it's uh um forever worth

1:33:16.880 --> 1:33:26.240
 of uh and of having you know fulfilling life with uh and of meaning like with with friends to uh to

1:33:26.240 --> 1:33:32.560
 spend the time with with kind of meaningful challenges to explore and individual interesting

1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:40.000
 things to be working on then i think absolutely move that's uh beautifully put live forever

1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:45.920
 but uh you'd have to check the fine print i think there's no better way to end it vitalik

1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:52.080
 thank you so much for talking to us so exciting to follow your work from a distance and uh thank

1:33:52.080 --> 1:33:56.800
 you for creating a revolutionary idea and sticking with it and building it out and doing some

1:33:56.800 --> 1:34:01.680
 incredible engineering work and thanks for talking today yeah thank you thanks for listening to this

1:34:36.240 --> 1:34:43.200
 that i often ask startups on top of ethereum is can you please tell me why using ethereum blockchain

1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:48.880
 is better than using excel and if they can come up with a good answer that's when you know you've

1:34:48.880 --> 1:35:02.720
 got something really interesting thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
