00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
 The following is a conversation with Po Shen Lou,

00:02.720 --> 00:06.280
 a professor of mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University,

00:06.280 --> 00:09.920
 national coach of the USA International Math Olympia team,

00:09.920 --> 00:13.480
 and founder of XP that does online education

00:13.480 --> 00:15.240
 of basic math and science.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.040
 He's also the founder of Novid,

00:17.040 --> 00:19.560
 an app that takes a really interesting approach

00:19.560 --> 00:20.760
 to contact tracing,

00:20.760 --> 00:23.080
 making sure you stay completely anonymous

00:23.080 --> 00:25.840
 and it gives you statistical information about COVID cases

00:25.840 --> 00:28.880
 in your physical network of interactions.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.600
 So you can maintain privacy, very important,

00:31.600 --> 00:34.160
 and make informed decisions.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.000
 In my opinion,

00:35.000 --> 00:38.720
 we desperately needed solutions like this in early 2020.

00:38.720 --> 00:41.440
 And unfortunately, I think,

00:41.440 --> 00:44.680
 we will again need it for the next pandemic.

00:44.680 --> 00:46.920
 To me, solutions that require large scale,

00:46.920 --> 00:49.640
 distributed coordination of human beings

00:49.640 --> 00:53.400
 need ideas that emphasize freedom and knowledge.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.120
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:55.120 --> 00:58.720
 Jordan Harbinger Show, Onnit, BetterHelp,

00:58.720 --> 01:01.200
 Aidsleep, and Element.

01:01.200 --> 01:04.320
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

01:04.320 --> 01:07.160
 As a side note, let me say that Po and I

01:07.160 --> 01:08.400
 filmed a few short videos

01:08.400 --> 01:10.640
 about simple, beautiful math concepts

01:10.640 --> 01:12.960
 that I will release soon.

01:12.960 --> 01:14.080
 It was really fun.

01:14.080 --> 01:16.640
 I really enjoyed Po sharing his passion for math with me

01:16.640 --> 01:17.840
 in those videos.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.960
 I'm hoping to do a few more short videos

01:19.960 --> 01:23.160
 in the coming months that are educational in nature

01:23.160 --> 01:26.520
 on AI, robotics, math, science, philosophy,

01:26.520 --> 01:28.840
 or if all else fails,

01:28.840 --> 01:32.920
 just fun snippets into my life on music, books, martial arts,

01:32.920 --> 01:34.720
 and other random things,

01:34.720 --> 01:38.240
 if that's of interest to anyone at all.

01:38.240 --> 01:40.200
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,

01:40.200 --> 01:42.960
 and here's my conversation with Po Shenlow.

01:43.840 --> 01:46.520
 You know, you mentioned you really enjoy flying

01:46.520 --> 01:49.720
 and experiencing different people in different places.

01:49.720 --> 01:51.160
 There's something about flying for me,

01:51.160 --> 01:53.080
 I don't know if you have the same experience,

01:53.080 --> 01:55.680
 that every time I get on an airplane,

01:55.680 --> 01:58.040
 it's incredible to me that human beings

01:58.040 --> 02:00.240
 have actually been able to achieve this.

02:00.240 --> 02:03.720
 And when I look at like what's happening now

02:03.720 --> 02:06.400
 with humans traveling out into space,

02:06.400 --> 02:08.080
 I see it as all the same thing.

02:08.080 --> 02:11.240
 It's incredible that humans are able to get into a box

02:11.240 --> 02:16.240
 and fly in the air and safely and land

02:16.320 --> 02:18.040
 in the same, it seems like,

02:18.040 --> 02:19.920
 and everybody's taking it for granted.

02:19.920 --> 02:22.480
 So when I observe them, it's quite fascinating

02:22.480 --> 02:25.880
 because I see that cleanly mapping to the world

02:25.880 --> 02:30.880
 where we're now in rockets and traveling to the moon,

02:31.520 --> 02:34.360
 traveling to Mars, and at the same kind of way,

02:34.360 --> 02:36.480
 I can already see the future

02:36.480 --> 02:38.680
 where we will all take it for granted.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.680
 So I don't know if you have,

02:42.680 --> 02:44.320
 you personally, when you fly,

02:44.320 --> 02:46.440
 have the same kind of magical experience

02:46.440 --> 02:49.080
 of like how the heck did humans actually accomplish this?

02:49.080 --> 02:52.560
 So I do, especially when there's turbulence,

02:52.560 --> 02:56.080
 which is like on the way here, there was turbulence

02:56.080 --> 02:58.880
 and the plane jiggled, even the flight attendant

02:58.880 --> 03:00.200
 had to hold onto the side.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.360
 And I was just thinking to myself,

03:01.360 --> 03:03.200
 it's amazing that this happens all the time

03:03.200 --> 03:04.960
 and the wings don't fall off,

03:04.960 --> 03:06.600
 given how many planes are flying.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.160
 But then I often think about it and I'm like,

03:09.160 --> 03:12.160
 a long time ago, I think people didn't trust elevators

03:12.160 --> 03:14.400
 in a 40 story building in New York City.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.000
 And now we just take it completely for granted

03:17.000 --> 03:18.600
 that you can step into this shaft,

03:18.600 --> 03:23.200
 which is 40 floors up and down, and it will just not fail.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.760
 Yeah, again, I'm the same way with elevators,

03:26.760 --> 03:30.360
 but also buildings, when I'll stand on the 40th floor

03:30.360 --> 03:35.320
 and wonder how the heck are we not falling right now?

03:35.320 --> 03:39.120
 Like how amazing it is with the high winds,

03:39.120 --> 03:42.200
 like structurally, just the earthquakes and the vibrations,

03:42.200 --> 03:44.520
 I mean, natural vibrations in the ground.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.960
 Like how is this, how are all of these,

03:46.960 --> 03:49.920
 you go to like New York City, all of these buildings standing.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.120
 I mean, to me, one of the most beautiful things,

03:52.120 --> 03:54.760
 actually mathematically too, is bridges.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.560
 I used to build bridges in high school from like toothpicks,

03:57.560 --> 04:02.320
 just like out of the pure joy of like physics,

04:02.320 --> 04:05.800
 making some structure really strong.

04:05.800 --> 04:09.600
 Understanding like from a civil engineering perspective,

04:09.600 --> 04:12.040
 what kind of structure will be stronger

04:12.040 --> 04:14.720
 than another kind of structure, like suspension bridges.

04:14.720 --> 04:17.160
 And then you see that at scale,

04:17.160 --> 04:20.400
 humans being able to span a body of water

04:20.400 --> 04:22.240
 with a giant bridge.

04:22.240 --> 04:26.480
 And it's, I don't know, it's so humbling.

04:26.480 --> 04:31.480
 It makes you realize how dependent we are on each other.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.360
 Sort of, I talk about love a lot,

04:33.360 --> 04:37.960
 but there's a certain element in which we little ants

04:37.960 --> 04:39.640
 have just a small amount of knowledge

04:39.640 --> 04:41.880
 about our particular thing.

04:41.880 --> 04:45.360
 And then we're depending on a network of knowledge

04:45.360 --> 04:47.360
 that other experts hold.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.200
 And then most of our lives,

04:49.200 --> 04:51.120
 most of the quality of life we have

04:51.120 --> 04:56.120
 has to do with the richness of that network of knowledge,

04:56.600 --> 04:58.280
 of that collaboration,

04:58.280 --> 05:02.000
 and then sort of the ability to build on top of it,

05:02.000 --> 05:03.200
 levels of abstractions.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.760
 You start from like bits in a computer,

05:05.760 --> 05:08.800
 then you can have assembly, then you can have C++,

05:08.800 --> 05:09.920
 or you have an operating system,

05:09.920 --> 05:12.040
 then you can have C++ and Python, finally,

05:12.040 --> 05:13.440
 some machine learning on top.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.960
 All of these are abstractions.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.120
 And eventually we'll have AI that runs all of us humans.

05:17.120 --> 05:21.280
 But anyway, but speaking of abstractions and programming,

05:21.280 --> 05:24.720
 in high school, you wrote some impressive games

05:24.720 --> 05:26.080
 for MS DOS.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.080
 I got a chance to, in browser somehow,

05:28.080 --> 05:30.480
 it's magic, I got a chance to play them.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.560
 Alien Attack 1, 2, 3, and 4.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.240
 What's the hardest part about programming those games?

05:37.240 --> 05:41.080
 And maybe can you tell the story about building those games?

05:41.080 --> 05:41.920
 Sure.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.240
 I actually tried to do those in high school

05:44.240 --> 05:46.480
 because I was just curious if I could.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.280
 That's a good starting point for anything, right?

05:49.280 --> 05:50.480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like, could you?

05:50.480 --> 05:52.000
 But the appealing thing was also,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.160
 it was a soup to nuts kind of thing.

05:54.160 --> 05:56.560
 So something that has always attracted me is,

05:56.560 --> 05:59.920
 I like beautiful ideas, I like seeing beautiful ideas,

05:59.920 --> 06:03.760
 but I actually also like seeing execution of an idea

06:03.760 --> 06:06.360
 all the way from beginning to end in something that works.

06:06.360 --> 06:08.000
 So for example, in high school,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.880
 I was lucky enough to grow up in the late 90s

06:10.880 --> 06:13.720
 when even a high school student could hope

06:13.720 --> 06:16.200
 to make something sort of comparable

06:16.200 --> 06:18.640
 to the shareware games that were out there.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.240
 I say the word sort of, like still quite far away,

06:21.240 --> 06:25.000
 but at least I didn't need to hire a 3D CG artist.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.200
 There weren't enough pixels to draw anyway,

06:27.200 --> 06:28.400
 even I can draw, right?

06:29.360 --> 06:30.280
 Bad art, of course.

06:30.280 --> 06:31.640
 But the point is, I wanted to know,

06:31.640 --> 06:34.640
 is it possible for me to try to do those things

06:34.640 --> 06:36.600
 where back in those days,

06:36.600 --> 06:38.440
 you didn't even have an easy way

06:38.440 --> 06:41.200
 to draw letters on the screen in a particular font.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.080
 You couldn't just say import a font, it wasn't like Python.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.440
 So for example, back then,

06:45.440 --> 06:47.560
 if you played those games in the web browser,

06:47.560 --> 06:51.840
 which is emulating the old school computer,

06:51.840 --> 06:53.520
 those, even the letters you see,

06:53.520 --> 06:55.120
 those are made by individual calls

06:55.120 --> 06:56.800
 to draw pixels on the screen.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.240
 So you built that from scratch,

06:58.240 --> 07:01.000
 almost building a computer graphics library from scratch?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.120
 Yes, the primitive that I got to use

07:03.120 --> 07:05.600
 was some code I copied off of a book in assembly

07:05.600 --> 07:08.720
 of how to put a pixel on a screen in a particular color.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.760
 And the programming language was Pascal?

07:11.760 --> 07:14.400
 Ah, yeah, the first one was in Pascal,

07:14.400 --> 07:18.120
 but then the other ones were in C++ after that.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.640
 How's the emulation in the browser work, by the way?

07:20.640 --> 07:21.640
 Is that trivial?

07:21.640 --> 07:23.520
 Because it's pretty cool, you get to play these games

07:23.520 --> 07:26.480
 that have a very much 90s feeling to them.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.320
 Ah, so it's literally making an MSDOS environment,

07:29.320 --> 07:32.240
 which is literally running the old.exe file.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.520
 Wow, in the browser.

07:33.520 --> 07:37.800
 This is, that could be more amazing than the airplane.

07:37.800 --> 07:40.240
 So it wasn't so much about the video games,

07:40.240 --> 07:41.400
 it was more about,

07:41.400 --> 07:44.120
 can you build something really cool from scratch?

07:44.120 --> 07:45.440
 Yes.

07:45.440 --> 07:50.280
 And you did a bunch of programming competitions.

07:50.280 --> 07:54.680
 What was your interest, your love for programming?

07:54.680 --> 07:56.880
 What did you learn through that experience?

07:56.880 --> 07:59.720
 Especially now that as much of your work

07:59.720 --> 08:03.160
 has taken a long journey through mathematics.

08:03.160 --> 08:04.920
 I think I always was amazed

08:04.920 --> 08:08.440
 by how computers could do things fast.

08:08.440 --> 08:11.560
 If I wanted to make it an abstract analysis

08:11.560 --> 08:14.640
 of why it is that I saw some power in the computer.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.360
 Because if the computer can do things

08:16.360 --> 08:18.280
 so many times faster than humans,

08:18.280 --> 08:20.280
 where the hard part is telling the computer

08:20.280 --> 08:21.840
 what to do and how to do it,

08:21.840 --> 08:25.600
 if you can master that asking the computer what to do,

08:25.600 --> 08:28.200
 then you could conceivably achieve more things.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.640
 And those contests I was in,

08:29.640 --> 08:31.840
 those were the opposite in some sense

08:31.840 --> 08:35.840
 of making a complete product, like a game is a product.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.520
 Those contests were effectively write a function

08:38.520 --> 08:40.760
 to do something extremely efficiently.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.440
 And if you are able to do that,

08:42.440 --> 08:45.800
 then you can unlock more of the power of the computer.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.440
 But also doing it quickly.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.640
 There's a time element from the human perspective

08:49.640 --> 08:53.360
 to be able to program quickly.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.840
 There's something nice.

08:54.840 --> 08:57.920
 So there's almost like an athletics component

08:57.920 --> 09:01.240
 to where you're almost like an athlete

09:01.240 --> 09:03.920
 seeking optimal performance as a human being

09:03.920 --> 09:05.680
 trying to write these programs.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.440
 And at the same time, it's kind of art

09:07.440 --> 09:11.080
 because the best way to write a program quickly

09:11.080 --> 09:13.440
 is to write a simple program.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.840
 You just have a damn good solution.

09:14.840 --> 09:17.040
 So it's not necessarily you have to type fast.

09:17.040 --> 09:19.520
 You have to think through a really clean,

09:19.520 --> 09:22.760
 beautiful solution.

09:22.760 --> 09:26.080
 I mean, what do you think is the use

09:26.080 --> 09:27.760
 of those programming competitions?

09:27.760 --> 09:29.160
 Do you think they're ultimately something

09:29.160 --> 09:30.600
 you would recommend for students,

09:30.600 --> 09:32.040
 for people interested in programming,

09:32.040 --> 09:34.000
 or people interested in building stuff?

09:34.000 --> 09:37.080
 Yes, I think so because especially with the work

09:37.080 --> 09:38.120
 that I've been doing nowadays,

09:38.120 --> 09:40.200
 even trying to control COVID,

09:40.200 --> 09:42.560
 something that was very helpful from day one

09:42.560 --> 09:45.560
 was understanding that the kinds of computations

09:45.560 --> 09:47.080
 we would want to do,

09:47.080 --> 09:50.440
 we could conceivably do on like a four core cloud machine

09:50.440 --> 09:53.760
 on Amazon Web Services out to a population

09:53.760 --> 09:55.280
 which might have hundreds of thousands

09:55.280 --> 09:56.480
 or millions of people.

09:56.480 --> 09:57.840
 The reason why that was important

09:57.840 --> 10:00.760
 to have that back of the envelope calculation

10:00.760 --> 10:02.720
 with efficient algorithms

10:02.720 --> 10:04.960
 is because if we couldn't do that,

10:04.960 --> 10:06.280
 then we would bankrupt ourselves

10:06.280 --> 10:08.160
 before we could get to a big enough scale.

10:08.160 --> 10:11.480
 If you think about how you grow anything from small to big,

10:11.480 --> 10:13.600
 if in order to grow it from small to big,

10:13.600 --> 10:16.480
 you also already need 10,000 cloud servers,

10:16.480 --> 10:17.680
 you'll never get to big.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.320
 And also the nice thing about programming competitions

10:22.320 --> 10:26.440
 is that you actually build a thing that works.

10:26.440 --> 10:29.040
 So you finish it, there's a completion thing,

10:29.040 --> 10:32.520
 and you realize, I think there's a magic to it,

10:32.520 --> 10:35.520
 where you realize that it's not so hard

10:35.520 --> 10:37.520
 to build something that works.

10:37.520 --> 10:40.560
 To have a system that successfully takes in inputs

10:40.560 --> 10:43.360
 and produces outputs and solves a difficult problem,

10:43.360 --> 10:47.040
 and that directly transfers to building a startup essentially

10:47.040 --> 10:50.000
 that can help some aspect of this world

10:50.000 --> 10:53.840
 as long as it's mostly based on software engineering.

10:53.840 --> 10:54.960
 Things get really tricky

10:54.960 --> 10:56.760
 when you have to manufacture stuff.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.720
 That's why people like Elon Musk are so impressive

11:00.720 --> 11:02.840
 that it's not just software.

11:02.840 --> 11:05.640
 Tesla Autopilot is not just software.

11:05.640 --> 11:07.640
 It's like you have to actually have factories

11:07.640 --> 11:11.640
 that build cars, and there's like a million components

11:11.640 --> 11:14.280
 involved in the machinery required

11:14.280 --> 11:16.200
 to assemble those cars and so on.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.000
 But in software, one person can change the world,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.440
 which is incredible.

11:21.440 --> 11:23.240
 But on the mathematics side,

11:23.240 --> 11:26.760
 what, if you look back, or maybe today,

11:26.760 --> 11:29.680
 what made you fall in love with mathematics?

11:29.680 --> 11:33.320
 For me, I think I've always been very attracted

11:33.320 --> 11:35.720
 to challenge, as I already indicated

11:35.720 --> 11:37.320
 with writing the program.

11:37.320 --> 11:40.440
 I guess if I see something that's hard

11:40.440 --> 11:41.960
 or supposed to be impossible,

11:44.200 --> 11:47.120
 sometimes I say, maybe I want to see if I can pull that off.

11:47.120 --> 11:49.920
 And with the mathematics, the math competitions

11:49.920 --> 11:53.560
 presented problems that were hard,

11:53.560 --> 11:55.040
 that I didn't know how to start,

11:55.040 --> 11:57.640
 but for which I could conceivably try to learn

11:57.640 --> 11:59.120
 how to solve them.

11:59.120 --> 12:00.480
 So, I mean, there are other things that are hard

12:00.480 --> 12:03.360
 called like get something to Mars, get people to Mars.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.800
 And I didn't, and I still don't think

12:05.800 --> 12:08.160
 that I am able to solve that problem.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.000
 On the other hand, the math problems struck me

12:10.000 --> 12:11.440
 as things which are hard

12:11.440 --> 12:13.560
 and with significant amount of extra work,

12:13.560 --> 12:14.640
 I could figure it out.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.560
 And maybe they would actually even be useful,

12:16.560 --> 12:18.920
 like that mathematical skill is the core

12:18.920 --> 12:20.240
 of lots of other things.

12:22.680 --> 12:23.720
 That's really interesting.

12:23.720 --> 12:25.120
 Maybe you could speak to that

12:25.120 --> 12:28.440
 because a lot of people say that math is hard

12:29.440 --> 12:31.600
 as a kind of negative statement.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.120
 It always seemed to me a little bit like

12:35.120 --> 12:37.360
 that's kind of a positive statement

12:37.360 --> 12:40.360
 that all things that are worth having in this world,

12:40.360 --> 12:41.440
 they're hard.

12:41.440 --> 12:44.480
 I mean, everything that people think about

12:44.480 --> 12:47.800
 that they would love to do, whether it's sports,

12:47.800 --> 12:52.800
 whether it's art, music, and all the sciences,

12:52.920 --> 12:54.000
 they're going to be hard

12:54.000 --> 12:56.520
 if you want to do something special.

12:56.520 --> 12:59.000
 So is there something you could say to that idea

12:59.000 --> 13:00.160
 that math is hard?

13:00.160 --> 13:04.200
 Should it be made easy or should it be hard?

13:04.200 --> 13:07.120
 Ah, so I think maybe I want to dig in a little bit

13:07.120 --> 13:09.360
 onto this hard part and say,

13:09.360 --> 13:12.120
 I think the interesting thing about the math

13:12.120 --> 13:14.800
 is that you can see a question

13:14.800 --> 13:18.240
 that you didn't know how to start doing it before.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.920
 And over a course of thinking about it,

13:20.920 --> 13:24.400
 you can come up with a way to solve it.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.960
 And so you can move from a state

13:25.960 --> 13:28.160
 of not being able to do something

13:28.160 --> 13:30.280
 to a state of being able to do something

13:30.280 --> 13:33.280
 where you help to take yourself through that

13:33.280 --> 13:37.600
 instead of somebody else spoon feeding you that technique.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.480
 So actually here, I'm already digging into

13:39.480 --> 13:42.080
 maybe part of my teaching philosophy also,

13:42.080 --> 13:45.400
 which is that I actually don't want to ever

13:45.400 --> 13:48.840
 just tell somebody, here's how you do something.

13:48.840 --> 13:52.160
 I actually prefer to say, here's an interesting question.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.240
 I know you don't quite know how to do it.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.920
 Do you have any ideas?

13:55.920 --> 13:58.920
 I'm actually explaining another way

13:58.920 --> 14:00.400
 that you could try to do teaching.

14:00.400 --> 14:04.160
 And I'm contrasting this to a method of watch me do this,

14:04.160 --> 14:06.320
 now practice it 20 times.

14:06.320 --> 14:09.080
 I'm trying to say a lot of people consider math to be hard

14:09.080 --> 14:10.800
 because maybe they can't remember

14:10.800 --> 14:12.800
 all of the methods that were taught.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.560
 But for me, I look at the hardness

14:15.560 --> 14:17.600
 and I don't think of it as a memory hardness.

14:17.600 --> 14:21.920
 I think of it as a, can you invent something hardness?

14:21.920 --> 14:24.360
 And I think that if we can teach more people

14:24.360 --> 14:28.640
 how to do that art of invention in a pure cognitive way,

14:28.640 --> 14:31.240
 not as hard as the actual hardware stuff, right?

14:31.240 --> 14:32.640
 But like in terms of the concepts

14:32.640 --> 14:34.000
 and the thoughts and the mathematics,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.360
 teaching people how to invent,

14:36.360 --> 14:38.840
 then suddenly actually they might not even find math

14:38.840 --> 14:42.680
 to be that tiresomeness hard anymore,

14:42.680 --> 14:47.480
 but that rewardingness hard of I have the capability

14:47.480 --> 14:49.920
 of looking at something which I don't know what to do

14:49.920 --> 14:51.400
 and coming up with how to do it.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.840
 I actually think we should be doing that,

14:52.840 --> 14:55.040
 giving people that capability.

14:55.040 --> 14:58.160
 So hard in the same way that invention is hard,

14:58.160 --> 14:59.520
 that is ultimately rewarding.

14:59.520 --> 15:03.640
 So maybe you can dig in that a little bit longer,

15:03.640 --> 15:08.640
 which is do you see basically the way to teach math

15:11.200 --> 15:14.840
 is to present a problem and to give a person a chance

15:14.840 --> 15:16.920
 to try to invent a solution

15:18.480 --> 15:21.080
 with minimal amount of information first?

15:21.080 --> 15:22.840
 Is that basically,

15:22.840 --> 15:26.400
 how do you build that muscle of invention in a student?

15:26.400 --> 15:27.840
 Yes, so the way that,

15:27.840 --> 15:30.120
 I guess I have two different sort of ways

15:30.120 --> 15:30.960
 that I try to teach.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.960
 Actually, one of them is, in fact, this semester,

15:32.960 --> 15:35.520
 because all my classes were remotely delivered,

15:35.520 --> 15:37.200
 I even threw them all onto my YouTube channel.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.960
 So you can see how I teach at Carnegie Mellon,

15:39.960 --> 15:43.280
 but I'd often say, hey, everyone, let's try to do this.

15:43.280 --> 15:44.680
 Any ideas?

15:44.680 --> 15:47.760
 And that actually changes my role as a professor

15:47.760 --> 15:50.040
 from a person who shows up for class

15:50.040 --> 15:52.480
 with a script of what I wanna talk through.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.000
 I actually, I don't have a script.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.680
 The way I show up for classes,

15:55.680 --> 15:58.080
 there's something that we want to learn how to do,

15:58.080 --> 16:00.120
 and we're gonna do it by improv.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.760
 I'm talking about the same method as improv comedy,

16:02.760 --> 16:05.240
 which is where you tell me some ideas,

16:05.240 --> 16:07.040
 and I'll try to yes and them.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.320
 You know what I mean?

16:09.320 --> 16:10.400
 And then together,

16:10.400 --> 16:13.000
 we're gonna come up with a proof of this concept

16:13.000 --> 16:16.360
 where you were deeply involved in creating the proof.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.040
 Actually, every time I teach the class,

16:18.040 --> 16:19.800
 we do every proof slightly differently

16:19.800 --> 16:23.400
 because it's based on how the students came up with it.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.760
 And that's how I do it when I'm in person.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.880
 I also have another line of courses that we make

16:27.880 --> 16:29.200
 that is delivered online.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.640
 Those things are where I can't do it live,

16:31.640 --> 16:34.560
 but the teaching method became also similar.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.160
 It was just, here's an interesting question.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.240
 I know it's out of reach.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.400
 Why don't you think about it?

16:39.400 --> 16:40.640
 And then automatic hints.

16:40.640 --> 16:44.120
 We feed automatically hints through the internet

16:44.120 --> 16:46.720
 to go and let the person try to invent.

16:47.560 --> 16:52.240
 So that's like a more rigorous prodding of invention.

16:52.240 --> 16:56.000
 But you did mention disease and COVID,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.160
 and you've been doing some very interesting stuff

16:58.160 --> 17:01.920
 from a mathematical, but also software engineering angle

17:01.920 --> 17:04.520
 of coming up with ideas.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.440
 It's back to the, I see a problem.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.680
 I think I can help.

17:09.640 --> 17:11.120
 So you stepped into this world.

17:11.120 --> 17:13.880
 Can you tell me about your work there

17:13.880 --> 17:16.120
 under the flag of Novid

17:16.120 --> 17:20.560
 and both the software and the technical details

17:20.560 --> 17:21.680
 of how the thing works?

17:21.680 --> 17:22.520
 Sure, sure.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.520
 So first I want to make sure that I say,

17:24.520 --> 17:26.000
 this is actually team effort.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.480
 I happen to be the one speaking,

17:27.480 --> 17:29.040
 but there's no way this would exist

17:29.040 --> 17:30.560
 without an incredible team of people

17:30.560 --> 17:33.120
 who inspire me every day to work on this.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.600
 But I'll speak on behalf of them.

17:34.600 --> 17:39.600
 So the idea was indeed that we stepped forward

17:40.200 --> 17:43.320
 in March of last year, when the world started to become,

17:43.320 --> 17:44.800
 our part of the world started to become,

17:44.800 --> 17:46.360
 our part meaning the United States

17:46.360 --> 17:48.920
 started to become paralyzed by COVID.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.760
 The shutdown started to happen.

17:50.760 --> 17:54.240
 And at that time it started as a figment of an idea,

17:54.240 --> 17:57.160
 which was network theory,

17:57.160 --> 17:59.480
 which is the area of math that I work in,

17:59.480 --> 18:02.440
 could potentially be combined with smartphones

18:02.440 --> 18:06.040
 and some kind of health information anonymized.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.080
 Exactly how?

18:07.080 --> 18:07.960
 We didn't know yet.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.400
 We tried to crystallize it.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.400
 And many months into this work,

18:11.400 --> 18:15.200
 we ended up accidentally discovering a new way

18:15.200 --> 18:17.000
 to control diseases,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.840
 which is now what is the main impetus of all of this work

18:20.840 --> 18:23.440
 is to take this idea and polish it

18:23.440 --> 18:25.960
 and hopefully have it be useful not only now,

18:25.960 --> 18:27.400
 but for future pandemics.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.680
 The idea is really simple to describe.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.080
 Actually, my main thing in the world

18:31.080 --> 18:33.720
 is I come up with obvious observations.

18:33.720 --> 18:35.080
 That's that, so I'll explain it now.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.880
 Einstein did the same thing

18:36.880 --> 18:38.480
 and he wrote a few short papers.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.800
 But so the idea is like this.

18:41.800 --> 18:46.440
 If we describe how usually people control disease

18:46.440 --> 18:47.920
 for a lot of history,

18:47.920 --> 18:51.000
 it was that you'd find out who was sick,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.280
 you'd find out who they've been around

18:53.280 --> 18:56.120
 and you try to remove all of those people from society

18:56.120 --> 18:57.840
 against their will.

18:57.840 --> 18:58.960
 Now that's the problem.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.880
 The against their will part

19:00.880 --> 19:03.560
 gives you the wrong kind of a feedback loop,

19:03.560 --> 19:05.520
 which makes it hard to control the disease

19:05.520 --> 19:07.000
 because then the people you're trying to control

19:07.000 --> 19:08.760
 keep getting other people sick.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.120
 You can see already how I'm thinking

19:10.120 --> 19:11.920
 and talking about this feedback loops.

19:11.920 --> 19:14.240
 This is actually related to something you said earlier

19:14.240 --> 19:17.120
 about even like how skyscrapers stay in the air.

19:17.120 --> 19:19.360
 The whole point is control theory.

19:19.360 --> 19:22.600
 You actually want to, or even how an airplane stays,

19:22.600 --> 19:24.880
 you need to have control loops

19:24.880 --> 19:27.040
 which are feedbacking in the right way.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.880
 And what we observed was that the feedback control loop

19:29.880 --> 19:32.160
 for controlling disease by asking people

19:32.160 --> 19:34.480
 to be removed from society against their will

19:34.480 --> 19:35.600
 was not working.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.640
 It was running against human incentives

19:37.640 --> 19:39.160
 and you suddenly are trying to control

19:39.160 --> 19:41.440
 seven billion, eight billion people

19:41.440 --> 19:43.600
 in ways that they don't individually want

19:43.600 --> 19:45.160
 to necessarily do.

19:45.160 --> 19:46.160
 So here's the idea.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.320
 And this is inspired by the fact

19:48.320 --> 19:49.480
 that at the core of our team

19:49.480 --> 19:51.280
 were user experience designers.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.480
 That's actually, in fact, the first thing I knew

19:53.480 --> 19:54.560
 we needed when we started

19:54.560 --> 19:57.160
 was to bring user experience at the core.

19:57.160 --> 19:58.160
 Okay.

19:58.160 --> 20:03.160
 But so the idea was suppose hypothetically

20:03.600 --> 20:05.320
 there was a pandemic.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.080
 What would you want?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.320
 You would want a way to be able to live your life

20:10.320 --> 20:13.680
 as much as possible and avoid getting sick.

20:13.680 --> 20:17.400
 Can we make an app to help you avoid getting sick?

20:17.400 --> 20:19.680
 Notice how I've just articulated the problem.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.840
 It is not, can we make an app

20:21.840 --> 20:24.720
 so that after you are around somebody who's sick

20:24.720 --> 20:27.080
 you can be removed from society.

20:27.080 --> 20:30.520
 It's can we make an app so that you can avoid getting sick.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.480
 That would run a positive feed.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.320
 I don't know if I want to call it positive or negative

20:35.320 --> 20:36.840
 but it would run a good feedback loop.

20:36.840 --> 20:37.680
 Okay.

20:37.680 --> 20:38.840
 So then how would you do this?

20:38.840 --> 20:41.480
 The only problem is that you don't know who's sick

20:41.480 --> 20:44.120
 because especially with this disease

20:44.120 --> 20:46.960
 if I see somebody who looks perfectly healthy

20:46.960 --> 20:50.000
 the disease spreads two days before you have any symptoms.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.360
 And so it's actually not possible.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.760
 That's where the network theory comes in.

20:54.760 --> 20:56.560
 You caught it from someone.

20:56.560 --> 20:59.560
 What if we changed the paradigm

20:59.560 --> 21:02.440
 and we said, whenever there's a sickness

21:02.440 --> 21:06.200
 tell everybody how many physical relationships

21:06.200 --> 21:08.000
 separate them from the sickness.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.840
 That is the trivial idea we added.

21:09.840 --> 21:13.360
 The trivial idea was the distance between you and a disease

21:13.360 --> 21:16.600
 is not measured in feet or seconds.

21:16.600 --> 21:19.040
 It's measured in terms of how many

21:19.040 --> 21:22.040
 close physical relationships separate you

21:22.040 --> 21:25.400
 like these six degrees of separation like LinkedIn.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.480
 Simple idea.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.080
 What if we told everyone that?

21:28.080 --> 21:30.200
 It turns out that actually unlocks

21:30.200 --> 21:33.040
 some interesting behavioral feedback loops

21:33.040 --> 21:37.040
 which for example, let me now jump to a non COVID example

21:37.040 --> 21:39.240
 to show why this maybe could be useful.

21:39.240 --> 21:40.920
 Actually we think it could be quite useful.

21:40.920 --> 21:44.080
 Imagine there was Ebola or some hemorrhagic fever.

21:44.080 --> 21:46.400
 Imagine it spread through contact through the air.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.160
 In fact, pretend, pretend.

21:50.520 --> 21:52.800
 That's a disastrous disease.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.720
 It has high fatality rate.

21:54.720 --> 21:59.160
 And as you die, you're bleeding out of every orifice.

22:00.640 --> 22:01.480
 Okay.

22:01.480 --> 22:02.320
 So.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.160
 Yeah, not pleasant.

22:03.160 --> 22:04.000
 Not pleasant.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.560
 So the question is, suppose that such a disease broke

22:07.680 --> 22:10.440
 who would want to install an app that would tell them

22:10.440 --> 22:12.640
 how many relationships away from them

22:12.640 --> 22:14.240
 this disease had struck?

22:14.240 --> 22:15.600
 Like a lot of people.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.440
 A lot of people.

22:16.440 --> 22:20.160
 In fact, almost, I don't want to say almost everyone.

22:20.160 --> 22:21.000
 That's a very strong statement

22:21.000 --> 22:22.840
 but a very large number of people.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.200
 That's fascinating framing.

22:24.200 --> 22:28.040
 Like the more deadly and transmissible the disease

22:28.040 --> 22:32.080
 the stronger the incentive to install it in a positive sense

22:32.080 --> 22:36.000
 the, in the good feedback loop sense.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.200
 That's a really good example.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.520
 It's a really good way to frame it.

22:38.520 --> 22:42.240
 Cause with COVID, it was not as deadly

22:42.240 --> 22:45.440
 as potential pandemics could have been

22:45.440 --> 22:46.280
 viruses could have been.

22:46.280 --> 22:49.160
 So it's sometimes muddled with how we think about it

22:49.160 --> 22:51.040
 but yeah, this is a really good framing.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.720
 If the virus was a lot more deadly

22:53.720 --> 22:56.280
 you want to create a system that has a set of incentives

22:56.280 --> 22:59.400
 that it quickly spreads to the population

22:59.400 --> 23:00.960
 where everybody is using it

23:00.960 --> 23:04.200
 and it's contributing in a positive way to the system.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.040
 Exactly.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.080
 And actually that point you just made

23:06.080 --> 23:07.760
 I don't take credit for that observation.

23:07.760 --> 23:09.000
 There was another person I talked to

23:09.000 --> 23:11.360
 who pointed out that it's very interesting

23:11.360 --> 23:14.600
 that this feedback loop is even more effective

23:14.600 --> 23:16.960
 when the disease is worse.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.720
 And that's actually not a bad characteristic to have

23:19.720 --> 23:20.640
 in your feedback loop

23:20.640 --> 23:24.320
 if you're trying to help civilization keep running.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.320
 Yeah, it's a really, it's in this dynamic

23:27.320 --> 23:30.440
 like people figure out, they dynamically figure out

23:30.440 --> 23:31.920
 how bad the disease is.

23:31.920 --> 23:35.080
 The more it spreads and the deadlier it is

23:35.080 --> 23:37.200
 as the people observe it

23:37.200 --> 23:39.640
 as long as the spread of information

23:39.640 --> 23:43.440
 like semantic information, natural language information

23:43.440 --> 23:46.040
 is closely aligned with the reality of the disease

23:46.040 --> 23:48.120
 which is a whole nother conversation, right?

23:48.120 --> 23:51.000
 We, that's, we might, maybe we'll chat about that

23:51.000 --> 23:53.800
 how we sort of make sure there's not misinformation

23:53.800 --> 23:54.960
 while there's accurate information

23:54.960 --> 23:58.840
 but that aside, okay, so this is a really nice property.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.880
 Right, and just going on on that

24:00.880 --> 24:02.840
 actually just talking more about what that could do

24:02.840 --> 24:04.440
 and why we're so excited about it.

24:04.440 --> 24:07.320
 It's that not only would people want to install it

24:07.320 --> 24:10.800
 but what would they do if you start to see

24:10.800 --> 24:13.200
 that this disease is getting closer and closer?

24:13.200 --> 24:15.080
 We surveyed informally people

24:15.080 --> 24:18.600
 but they said, as we saw it getting closer, we would hide.

24:18.600 --> 24:21.800
 We would try to not have contacts.

24:21.800 --> 24:24.080
 But now you notice what this has just achieved.

24:24.080 --> 24:27.400
 The whole goal on this whole exercise was

24:27.400 --> 24:29.720
 you got the people who might be sick

24:29.720 --> 24:32.000
 and you got everyone else, set A and set B.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.360
 Set A is the people who might be sick,

24:33.360 --> 24:34.840
 set B is everyone else.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.680
 And for the entirety of the past

24:37.680 --> 24:41.680
 contact tracing approaches, you tried to get set A

24:41.680 --> 24:44.920
 to do things that might not be to their liking or their will

24:44.920 --> 24:47.680
 because that's removing them from society.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.040
 We found out that there's two ways

24:49.040 --> 24:51.120
 to separate set A from set B.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.400
 You can also let the people at set B

24:53.400 --> 24:55.720
 at the fringe of set A

24:55.720 --> 24:58.920
 attempt to remove themselves from this interface.

24:58.920 --> 25:01.560
 It's the symmetry of A and B separation.

25:01.560 --> 25:04.520
 Everyone was looking at A, we look at B

25:04.520 --> 25:06.960
 and suddenly B is in their incentive to do so.

25:07.960 --> 25:08.960
 Beautiful.

25:08.960 --> 25:11.960
 So there's a virus that jumps from human to human.

25:11.960 --> 25:15.200
 So there's a network sometimes called graph

25:16.240 --> 25:18.400
 of the spread of a virus.

25:18.400 --> 25:21.640
 It hops from person to person to person to person.

25:21.640 --> 25:25.760
 And each one of us individuals are sitting

25:25.760 --> 25:28.200
 or plopped into that network.

25:28.200 --> 25:31.680
 We have close friends and relations and so on.

25:31.680 --> 25:32.520
 It's kind of fascinating

25:32.520 --> 25:33.880
 to actually think about this network

25:33.880 --> 25:35.520
 and we can maybe talk about the shapes

25:35.520 --> 25:36.720
 of this kind of network.

25:37.680 --> 25:39.920
 Because I was trying to think exactly this,

25:39.920 --> 25:41.400
 like how many people do I,

25:41.400 --> 25:43.480
 well, I'm kind of an introvert, not kind of,

25:43.480 --> 25:45.160
 I'm very much an introvert.

25:45.160 --> 25:48.200
 But so can I be explicit about the kind of people

25:48.200 --> 25:50.360
 I meet in regular life?

25:50.360 --> 25:53.280
 Say when it was completely opened up, there's no pandemic.

25:54.840 --> 25:58.480
 There is a kind of network and there's maybe

25:59.440 --> 26:02.280
 in the graph theoretic sense, there's some weights

26:02.280 --> 26:06.920
 or something about how close that relationship is

26:06.920 --> 26:08.800
 in terms of the frequency of visits,

26:08.800 --> 26:11.560
 the duration of visits and all of those kinds of things.

26:11.560 --> 26:14.840
 So you're saying we might want to be,

26:14.840 --> 26:18.040
 to create on top of that network,

26:18.040 --> 26:22.240
 a spread of information to let you know

26:22.240 --> 26:24.400
 as the virus travels through this network,

26:24.400 --> 26:26.240
 how close is it getting to you?

26:26.240 --> 26:29.240
 And the number of hops away it is on that network

26:29.240 --> 26:31.320
 is really powerful information

26:31.320 --> 26:33.960
 that creates a positive feedback loop

26:33.960 --> 26:37.400
 where you can act essentially anonymously

26:39.080 --> 26:41.200
 and on your own.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.960
 Like nobody's telling you what to do,

26:43.960 --> 26:46.920
 which is really important, is decentralized

26:46.920 --> 26:51.920
 and not whatever the opposite of authoritarian is.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.640
 But you get to sort of the American way.

26:54.640 --> 26:56.320
 You get to choose to do it yourself.

26:56.320 --> 26:58.440
 You have the freedom to do it yourself

26:58.440 --> 27:00.160
 and you're incentivized to do it.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.920
 And you're most likely going to do it

27:01.920 --> 27:06.920
 to protect yourself against you getting the disease

27:08.400 --> 27:10.000
 as the closer it gets to you

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
 based on the information that you have.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.880
 But can you maybe elaborate, first of all, brilliant.

27:17.880 --> 27:20.320
 Whenever I saw the thing you're working on,

27:20.320 --> 27:23.360
 so forget for COVID, this is of course,

27:23.360 --> 27:26.800
 really relevant for COVID, but it's also probably relevant

27:26.800 --> 27:28.160
 for future diseases as well.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.400
 So that was the thing I'm nervous about.

27:30.400 --> 27:31.840
 I was like, if this whole,

27:31.840 --> 27:34.720
 if our society shut down because of COVID,

27:34.720 --> 27:38.040
 like what the heck is gonna happen

27:38.040 --> 27:40.480
 when there's a much deadlier disease?

27:40.480 --> 27:41.920
 Like this, this is disappointing.

27:41.920 --> 27:44.760
 The whole time, 2020, the whole time

27:44.760 --> 27:45.960
 I'm just sitting like this,

27:45.960 --> 27:49.840
 like is the incompetence of everybody

27:49.840 --> 27:53.000
 except the people developing vaccines.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.400
 The biologists are the only ones

27:54.400 --> 27:56.040
 that got their stuff together.

27:56.040 --> 27:58.560
 But in terms of institutions and all that kind of stuff,

27:58.560 --> 28:00.720
 it's just been terrible.

28:00.720 --> 28:04.080
 But this is exactly the power of information

28:04.080 --> 28:05.960
 and the power of information

28:05.960 --> 28:08.080
 that doesn't limit personal freedom.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.400
 So your idea is brilliant.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.680
 Okay, mathematically, can you maybe elaborate

28:12.680 --> 28:14.080
 what are we talking about?

28:14.080 --> 28:16.480
 Like how do you actually make that work?

28:16.480 --> 28:17.680
 What's involved?

28:17.680 --> 28:19.720
 Sure, first I'm gonna reply to something you said

28:19.720 --> 28:22.400
 about the freedom inside this,

28:22.400 --> 28:24.480
 because actually that was the idea.

28:24.480 --> 28:27.320
 The idea is this is game theory, right?

28:27.320 --> 28:29.600
 And effectively what we did is analogous

28:29.600 --> 28:34.600
 to free market economy, as opposed to central planning.

28:34.840 --> 28:38.120
 If you just line up the set of incentives correctly

28:38.120 --> 28:43.120
 so that people have in their purely selfish behavior

28:43.240 --> 28:47.120
 are contributing to the optimization of the global function,

28:47.120 --> 28:47.960
 that's it.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.400
 And the point of what we do, I guess in mathematics

28:50.400 --> 28:52.800
 is we try to explore the search space

28:52.800 --> 28:54.960
 to go and find out as many possibilities as there are.

28:54.960 --> 28:58.080
 And in this case, it's an applied search space.

28:58.080 --> 29:00.120
 That's why the inputs from design,

29:00.120 --> 29:02.720
 user experience design and actual people are important.

29:02.720 --> 29:05.760
 But you asked about, I guess, the mathematical

29:05.760 --> 29:07.640
 or the technical things underpinning it.

29:07.640 --> 29:09.800
 So I think the first thing I'll say is

29:09.800 --> 29:11.480
 we wanted to make this thing

29:12.600 --> 29:14.760
 not require your personal information.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.360
 And so in order to do that,

29:16.360 --> 29:18.800
 what gave me the confidence to, I guess,

29:18.800 --> 29:20.560
 lead our team to run at the beginning

29:20.560 --> 29:23.800
 is we saw that this could be done without using GPS information.

29:24.960 --> 29:28.160
 So technically what's going on is if two smartphones,

29:28.160 --> 29:29.040
 it's a smartphone app.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.480
 If two smartphones have this thing installed,

29:31.480 --> 29:34.560
 they just communicate with each other by Bluetooth

29:35.440 --> 29:37.080
 to go and find out how far,

29:38.200 --> 29:40.080
 they can detect nearby things by Bluetooth.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.040
 And then they can find out that these two phones

29:42.040 --> 29:44.880
 were approximately such and such distance apart.

29:44.880 --> 29:47.680
 And that kind of relative proximity information

29:47.680 --> 29:50.640
 is enough to construct this big network.

29:50.640 --> 29:53.160
 Okay, so the physical network is constructed

29:53.160 --> 29:56.040
 based on proximity that's through Bluetooth

29:56.040 --> 29:59.320
 and you don't have to specify your exact location,

29:59.320 --> 30:01.200
 it's the proximity.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.320
 I'm not using the Pythagorean theorem basically.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.520
 I mean, if I just knew the GPS coordinates,

30:05.520 --> 30:07.320
 we could use the Pythagorean theorem too.

30:07.320 --> 30:08.520
 Sorry, that's just how I call it.

30:08.520 --> 30:10.520
 Distance formula, whatever you want to call it.

30:10.520 --> 30:14.800
 Yeah, so we're not doing

30:14.800 --> 30:18.280
 the old Pythagorean based violation of privacy.

30:18.280 --> 30:19.120
 Okay.

30:21.240 --> 30:26.200
 But so is that enough to form,

30:27.280 --> 30:31.160
 to give you enough information about physical connection

30:31.160 --> 30:32.880
 to another human being?

30:32.880 --> 30:35.240
 Is there a time element there?

30:35.240 --> 30:37.400
 Is there, so, okay.

30:37.400 --> 30:41.560
 That sounds like a really strong, like low hanging fruit.

30:41.560 --> 30:42.480
 Like if you have that,

30:42.480 --> 30:44.920
 you could probably go really, really far.

30:44.920 --> 30:46.880
 My natural question is,

30:46.880 --> 30:49.760
 is there extra information you can add on top of that?

30:49.760 --> 30:53.520
 Like the duration of the physical proximity?

30:53.520 --> 30:56.640
 So first of all, we actually do estimate the duration,

30:56.640 --> 30:58.360
 but the way we estimate the duration

30:58.360 --> 31:00.440
 is like how a movie is filmed,

31:00.440 --> 31:03.200
 in the sense that every so often, every few minutes,

31:03.200 --> 31:04.640
 we check what's nearby.

31:04.640 --> 31:06.240
 It's like how a movie is filmed.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.960
 You take lots of snapshots.

31:07.960 --> 31:11.280
 So there's no way in a battery efficient way

31:11.280 --> 31:14.680
 to really keep track of that proximity.

31:14.680 --> 31:17.120
 However, fortunately, we're using probability.

31:17.120 --> 31:20.120
 The fact is the paradigm that we're using

31:20.120 --> 31:22.000
 is it's not super important

31:22.000 --> 31:24.080
 if you run into that person only for 10 minutes

31:24.080 --> 31:25.680
 at the grocery store.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.640
 If that's a stranger that you run into 10 minutes

31:27.640 --> 31:28.920
 in this grocery store,

31:28.920 --> 31:30.880
 that's not gonna be relevant for our paradigm

31:30.880 --> 31:33.080
 because our paradigm is not telling you

31:33.080 --> 31:35.000
 who were you around before

31:35.000 --> 31:38.600
 and might therefore have gotten infected by already.

31:38.600 --> 31:40.160
 Ours is about predicting the future.

31:40.160 --> 31:42.680
 We change from, I mean, the standard paradigm was

31:42.680 --> 31:45.200
 what already happened, quick damage control.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.560
 Ours is predict the future.

31:46.560 --> 31:49.280
 If you run into that person once in the grocery store today

31:49.280 --> 31:50.360
 and never see them again,

31:50.360 --> 31:52.520
 it's irrelevant for predicting the future.

31:52.520 --> 31:54.800
 And therefore, for ours, what really matters

31:54.800 --> 31:57.960
 is the many hours around the other person,

31:57.960 --> 31:59.600
 at which point, if you're scanning every five

31:59.600 --> 32:00.640
 to eight minutes.

32:00.640 --> 32:02.040
 That's going to come out in the problem,

32:02.040 --> 32:03.240
 like statistically speaking,

32:03.240 --> 32:05.400
 it's going to come out as a strong relationship

32:05.400 --> 32:08.760
 and a person in the grocery store is going to wash out

32:08.760 --> 32:11.360
 is not an important physical relationship.

32:11.360 --> 32:12.600
 I mean, this is brilliant.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.880
 How difficult is it to make work?

32:15.880 --> 32:19.000
 So you said, one, there's a mathematical component

32:19.000 --> 32:21.280
 that we just kind of talked about,

32:21.280 --> 32:24.000
 and then there's the user experience component.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.080
 So how difficult does it to go,

32:26.080 --> 32:28.680
 just like you built the video game, Alien Attack,

32:29.920 --> 32:33.800
 from zero to completion, what's involved?

32:33.800 --> 32:34.920
 How difficult is it?

32:34.920 --> 32:36.720
 So I'm going to answer that question

32:36.720 --> 32:39.360
 in terms of building the product,

32:39.360 --> 32:40.880
 but then I'm also going to acknowledge

32:40.880 --> 32:44.760
 that just having an app doesn't make it useful

32:44.760 --> 32:47.640
 because that's actually maybe the easy part.

32:48.560 --> 32:49.400
 If you know what I mean,

32:49.400 --> 32:50.320
 there's like all of this stuff

32:50.320 --> 32:52.040
 about rollout adoption and awareness,

32:52.040 --> 32:53.760
 but let's focus on the app part first.

32:53.760 --> 32:56.320
 So that's again, why I said the team is incredible.

32:56.320 --> 32:58.840
 So we have a bunch of people who,

32:59.800 --> 33:02.720
 let's just say that the technology that we use to make it

33:02.720 --> 33:04.960
 is not the standard way you make an app.

33:04.960 --> 33:08.680
 If you think about a standard iOS app or Android app,

33:08.680 --> 33:12.120
 those are a user interface that contacts a web server

33:12.120 --> 33:14.080
 and sends some information back and forth.

33:14.080 --> 33:16.000
 We're doing some stuff that has to hook

33:16.000 --> 33:17.880
 into the operating system of saying,

33:17.880 --> 33:19.280
 let's go use Bluetooth for something

33:19.280 --> 33:21.600
 it wasn't really meant for, right?

33:21.600 --> 33:22.960
 So there's that part.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.520
 By the way, what is the app called?

33:24.520 --> 33:27.520
 Oh, it's called Novid, COVID with an N.

33:28.760 --> 33:29.600
 Very nice.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.360
 So you have to hook into Bluetooth.

33:31.360 --> 33:36.240
 You're saying you have to do that beyond the permissions

33:36.240 --> 33:39.560
 that are like at the very surface level

33:39.560 --> 33:40.680
 provided on the phone?

33:40.680 --> 33:42.440
 Well, I don't want to call them permissions.

33:42.440 --> 33:43.280
 I just want to say,

33:43.280 --> 33:45.440
 that's not what you usually do with Bluetooth.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.280
 Gotcha.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.680
 Usually with Bluetooth, you say,

33:47.680 --> 33:49.080
 do I have headphones nearby?

33:49.080 --> 33:49.920
 Yes.

33:49.920 --> 33:50.760
 Okay, I'm done.

33:50.760 --> 33:53.160
 You don't go and say, do I have headphones nearby?

33:53.160 --> 33:55.520
 Or do I have another phone nearby, which is doing something?

33:55.520 --> 33:56.760
 And then keep asking that same question.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.320
 Keep asking the question.

33:58.320 --> 33:59.160
 Right?

33:59.160 --> 34:00.240
 So it's actually not easy.

34:00.240 --> 34:02.160
 And I mean, there were some parts of it,

34:02.160 --> 34:05.840
 which actually a lot of people had tried unsuccessfully.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.960
 Actually, it's known that, for example,

34:07.960 --> 34:11.600
 the UK was trying to do something similar.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.640
 And the problem they ran into was,

34:13.640 --> 34:16.360
 when you program things on iOS,

34:16.360 --> 34:19.320
 iOS is very good at making it hard

34:19.320 --> 34:20.760
 to do things in the background.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.800
 And so there was quite a lot of effort required

34:23.800 --> 34:25.440
 to go and make this thing work.

34:25.440 --> 34:28.160
 So the whole point, this thing would run in the background

34:28.160 --> 34:33.160
 and iOS, I mean, most Android probably as well, right?

34:33.720 --> 34:35.480
 But yeah, iOS certainly makes it difficult

34:35.480 --> 34:36.880
 for something to run in the background,

34:36.880 --> 34:40.400
 especially when it's eating up your battery, right?

34:40.400 --> 34:42.240
 Well, we wanted to make sure we didn't eat up the battery.

34:42.240 --> 34:43.480
 So that one we can,

34:43.480 --> 34:44.920
 we actually are very proud of the fact

34:44.920 --> 34:46.680
 that ours uses very little battery.

34:47.760 --> 34:51.560
 Actually, even if compared to Apple's own system, so.

34:51.560 --> 34:52.400
 Beautiful.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.480
 So what else is required to make this thing work?

34:54.480 --> 34:56.840
 Right, so the key was that you had to do

34:56.840 --> 34:58.800
 a significant amount of work on the actual

34:58.800 --> 35:00.160
 mobile app development,

35:00.160 --> 35:02.120
 which fortunately the team that we brought

35:02.120 --> 35:04.000
 was this kind of general thinkers

35:04.000 --> 35:07.120
 where we would dig in deep into the operating system

35:07.120 --> 35:09.400
 documentation and the API libraries.

35:09.400 --> 35:10.600
 So we got that working.

35:10.600 --> 35:12.280
 But there's another angle, which is,

35:12.280 --> 35:15.000
 you also need the servers to be able to compute fast enough,

35:15.000 --> 35:17.360
 which is tying back to this old school

35:17.360 --> 35:20.040
 computer programming competitions and math Olympiads.

35:20.040 --> 35:23.000
 In fact, our team that was working on the algorithm

35:23.000 --> 35:25.440
 and backend side included several people

35:25.440 --> 35:29.320
 who had been in these competitions from before,

35:29.320 --> 35:32.360
 which I happen to know because I do coach the team

35:32.360 --> 35:33.360
 for the math.

35:33.360 --> 35:37.240
 And so we were able to bring people in to build servers,

35:37.240 --> 35:40.120
 a server infrastructure in C++ actually,

35:40.120 --> 35:43.080
 so that we could support significant numbers of people

35:43.080 --> 35:45.360
 without needing tons of servers.

35:45.360 --> 35:48.000
 Is there some distributed algorithms working here

35:48.000 --> 35:51.560
 or you basically have to keep in the same place

35:51.560 --> 35:53.720
 the entire graph as it builds?

35:53.720 --> 35:56.280
 Cause especially the more and more people use it,

35:56.280 --> 35:58.240
 the bigger, the bigger the graph gets.

35:58.240 --> 36:02.280
 I mean, this is very difficult scaling problem, right?

36:02.280 --> 36:05.600
 Ah, so that's actually why this computer algorithm

36:05.600 --> 36:07.120
 competition stuff was handy.

36:07.120 --> 36:11.200
 It's because there are only about seven to eight

36:11.200 --> 36:12.920
 giga people in the world.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.000
 Yeah.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.160
 That's not that many.

36:15.160 --> 36:17.520
 So if you can make your algorithms linear time

36:17.520 --> 36:22.320
 or almost linear time, a computer operates in gigahertz.

36:22.320 --> 36:26.000
 I only need to do one run, one recalculation every hour

36:26.000 --> 36:29.080
 in terms of telling people how far away these dangers are.

36:29.080 --> 36:29.920
 Yes.

36:29.920 --> 36:33.520
 So I suddenly have 3,600 seconds

36:33.520 --> 36:36.520
 and my CPU cores are running in gigahertz.

36:36.520 --> 36:39.520
 And at most they're eight giga people.

36:39.520 --> 36:44.000
 Well, you skipping over the fact that there's N squared

36:44.000 --> 36:46.840
 potential connections between people.

36:46.840 --> 36:51.400
 So how do you get around the fact that, you know,

36:51.400 --> 36:54.440
 that we, you know, the potential set of relationship

36:54.440 --> 36:56.160
 any one of us could have is a billion.

36:56.160 --> 36:59.200
 So it's a billion times squared.

36:59.200 --> 37:02.720
 That's the potential amount of data you have to be storing

37:02.720 --> 37:05.280
 and computing over and constantly updating.

37:05.280 --> 37:08.120
 So the way we dealt with that is we actually expect

37:08.120 --> 37:10.840
 that the typical network is very sparse.

37:10.840 --> 37:14.840
 The technical term sparse would mean that the average degree

37:14.840 --> 37:17.640
 or the average number of connections that a person has

37:17.640 --> 37:21.160
 is going to be at most like a hundred strong connections

37:21.160 --> 37:22.520
 that you care about.

37:22.520 --> 37:25.520
 If you think of it almost in terms of the heavy hitters,

37:25.520 --> 37:28.200
 actually in most people's lives,

37:28.200 --> 37:29.880
 a hundred, if we just kept track

37:29.880 --> 37:32.440
 of their top hundred interactions,

37:32.440 --> 37:34.240
 that's probably most of the signal.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.680
 Yeah, yeah.

37:37.680 --> 37:40.400
 I'm saddened to think that I might not be even

37:40.400 --> 37:42.040
 in a double digits, but.

37:42.040 --> 37:44.720
 Oh, I was intentionally giving a crazy number

37:44.720 --> 37:46.160
 to account for college students.

37:46.160 --> 37:48.960
 You call, oh, those are the,

37:48.960 --> 37:50.000
 who you call on the heavy hitters,

37:50.000 --> 37:52.040
 the people who are like the social butterflies.

37:52.040 --> 37:53.680
 Yeah, I need to,

37:54.840 --> 37:56.920
 I'd love to know that information about myself,

37:56.920 --> 38:01.920
 by the way, that, do you expose the graph,

38:01.960 --> 38:04.480
 like how many, like about yourself,

38:04.480 --> 38:06.080
 how many connections you have?

38:06.080 --> 38:07.920
 We do expose to each person

38:07.920 --> 38:09.600
 how many direct connections they have.

38:09.600 --> 38:10.440
 That's great.

38:10.440 --> 38:11.600
 But for privacy purposes,

38:11.600 --> 38:14.120
 we don't tell anybody who their connections,

38:14.120 --> 38:16.000
 like how their connections are interconnected.

38:16.000 --> 38:16.880
 Yes, gotcha.

38:16.880 --> 38:19.400
 But at the same time, we do expose also to everyone

38:19.400 --> 38:21.000
 an interesting chart that says,

38:21.000 --> 38:22.840
 here's how many people you have

38:22.840 --> 38:24.400
 that you're connected to directly.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.720
 Here's how many at distance two,

38:26.720 --> 38:27.880
 meaning via people.

38:27.880 --> 38:29.600
 And then here's how many at distance three.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.920
 And the reason we do that,

38:30.920 --> 38:32.880
 is that actually ends up being a dynamic

38:32.880 --> 38:34.440
 that also boosts adoption.

38:34.440 --> 38:36.360
 It drives another feedback loop.

38:36.360 --> 38:38.120
 The reason is because we saw, actually,

38:38.120 --> 38:40.520
 when we deployed this in some universities,

38:40.520 --> 38:42.760
 that when people see on their app

38:42.760 --> 38:46.000
 that they are indirectly connected to hundreds

38:46.000 --> 38:47.600
 or thousands of other people,

38:47.600 --> 38:49.120
 they get excited and they tell other people,

38:49.120 --> 38:50.760
 hey, let's download this app.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.960
 But you know, we also saw in those examples,

38:52.960 --> 38:55.480
 especially looking at the screenshots people gave,

38:55.480 --> 38:58.600
 that is hit as soon as the typical person

38:58.600 --> 39:02.600
 has two or three other direct connections on the system.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.440
 Because that means that our app

39:04.440 --> 39:07.680
 has reached a virality or not of two to three.

39:07.680 --> 39:10.880
 The key is we were making a viral app to fight a virus

39:10.880 --> 39:13.920
 spreading on the same network that the virus spreads on.

39:14.880 --> 39:17.120
 So you're trying to out virus the virus.

39:17.120 --> 39:17.960
 That's right.

39:17.960 --> 39:20.280
 That's exactly right.

39:20.280 --> 39:21.400
 Okay, great.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.640
 What have you learned from this whole experience

39:23.640 --> 39:26.520
 in terms of, let's say for COVID,

39:26.520 --> 39:28.800
 but for future pandemics as well,

39:29.840 --> 39:33.760
 is it possible to use the power information here

39:33.760 --> 39:38.520
 of networked information as a virus spreads and travels

39:38.520 --> 39:41.400
 in order to basically keep the society open?

39:41.400 --> 39:44.840
 Is it possible for people to protect themselves

39:44.840 --> 39:46.200
 with this information?

39:46.200 --> 39:48.920
 Or do you still have to have most,

39:48.920 --> 39:50.680
 like in this overarching policy

39:50.680 --> 39:53.680
 of everybody should stay at home, that kind of thing?

39:53.680 --> 39:55.400
 We are trying to answer that question right now.

39:55.400 --> 39:57.600
 So the answer is we don't know yet,

39:57.600 --> 39:59.320
 but that's actually why we're very happy

39:59.320 --> 40:02.720
 that now the idea has started to become more widely known.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.640
 And we're already starting to collaborate

40:04.640 --> 40:06.520
 with epidemiologists.

40:06.520 --> 40:08.880
 Again, I'm just a mathematician, right?

40:08.880 --> 40:11.040
 And a mathematician should not be the person

40:11.040 --> 40:13.720
 who is telling everybody, this will definitely work.

40:13.720 --> 40:17.680
 But because of the potential power of this approach,

40:17.680 --> 40:19.160
 especially the potential power

40:19.160 --> 40:21.960
 of this being an end game for COVID,

40:22.880 --> 40:26.240
 we have gotten the interest of real researchers.

40:26.240 --> 40:27.720
 And we're now working together

40:27.720 --> 40:30.240
 to try to actually understand the answer to that question.

40:30.240 --> 40:31.600
 Because you see, there's a theory.

40:31.600 --> 40:34.160
 So what I can share is the mathematics of,

40:34.160 --> 40:36.680
 here's why there's some hope that this would work.

40:36.680 --> 40:39.440
 And that's because I'm talking about end game now.

40:39.440 --> 40:41.560
 End game means you have very few cases.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.600
 But everywhere, we're always thinking,

40:43.600 --> 40:46.480
 once there's few cases, then does that mean we now open up?

40:46.480 --> 40:49.560
 Once you open up in the past, then the cases go up again

40:49.560 --> 40:51.440
 until you have to lock down again.

40:51.440 --> 40:54.200
 And now when we talk about the dynamic process that makes,

40:54.200 --> 40:55.880
 it's guaranteeing you always have cases

40:55.880 --> 40:57.160
 until you have the great vaccines,

40:57.160 --> 41:00.680
 which is, we both got vaccinated, this is good.

41:00.680 --> 41:02.520
 But at the same time, why I'm thinking

41:02.520 --> 41:04.360
 this is still important is because we know

41:04.360 --> 41:06.560
 that many vaccine makers have said

41:06.560 --> 41:09.760
 they're preparing for the next dose next year.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.720
 And if we have a perpetual thing

41:11.720 --> 41:14.480
 where you just always need a new vaccine every year,

41:14.480 --> 41:16.280
 it could actually be beneficial to make sure

41:16.280 --> 41:18.800
 we have as many other techniques as possible

41:18.800 --> 41:20.840
 for parts of the world that can't afford,

41:20.840 --> 41:23.160
 for example, that kind of distribution.

41:23.160 --> 41:26.360
 Yeah, so actually, no matter how deadly the virus is,

41:26.360 --> 41:27.720
 no matter how many things,

41:27.720 --> 41:29.680
 whether you have a vaccine or not,

41:29.680 --> 41:31.920
 it's still useful to be having this information.

41:31.920 --> 41:32.760
 Yes.

41:32.760 --> 41:35.880
 Because to stay home or not, depending on how risk,

41:35.880 --> 41:39.160
 I'm a big fan, just like you said, of having the freedom

41:39.160 --> 41:43.240
 for you to decide how risk averse you wanna be, right?

41:43.240 --> 41:44.400
 Depending on your own conditions,

41:44.400 --> 41:47.240
 but also on the state of like what you,

41:47.240 --> 41:50.080
 just how dangerously you like to live.

41:50.080 --> 41:51.960
 So I think that actually makes a lot of sense.

41:51.960 --> 41:54.920
 And I also think that since we're,

41:54.920 --> 41:56.960
 when you think of disease spreading,

41:56.960 --> 42:00.520
 it spreads in aggregate in the sense that

42:00.520 --> 42:04.680
 if there are some people who maybe are more risk tolerant

42:04.680 --> 42:06.480
 because of other things in their life,

42:06.480 --> 42:08.040
 well, there might also be other people

42:08.040 --> 42:09.800
 who are less risk tolerance.

42:09.800 --> 42:12.720
 And then those people decide to isolate.

42:12.720 --> 42:14.520
 But what matters is in the aggregate

42:14.520 --> 42:17.680
 that this R naught of the infection spreading

42:17.680 --> 42:19.000
 drops below one.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.200
 And so the key is if you can empower people

42:21.200 --> 42:23.440
 with that power to make that decision,

42:23.440 --> 42:25.080
 you might actually still be able to drive

42:25.080 --> 42:26.480
 that R naught down below one.

42:27.600 --> 42:30.240
 Yeah, and also, this is me talking,

42:31.480 --> 42:33.720
 people get a little bit nervous, I think,

42:33.720 --> 42:38.280
 with information somehow mapping to privacy violation.

42:38.280 --> 42:42.240
 But first of all, in the approach you're describing,

42:42.240 --> 42:44.600
 that's respecting anonymity.

42:46.240 --> 42:49.240
 But I would love to have information

42:49.240 --> 42:52.760
 from the very beginning, from March and April of last year,

42:54.040 --> 42:59.040
 almost like a map of like where it's risky

42:59.080 --> 43:01.360
 and where it's not to go.

43:01.360 --> 43:05.200
 And not map based on sort of the exact location of people,

43:05.200 --> 43:07.560
 but where people usually hang out kind of thing.

43:07.560 --> 43:12.560
 Just, and maybe not necessarily about actual location,

43:13.080 --> 43:15.240
 but just maybe activities,

43:15.240 --> 43:19.680
 like just to have information about what is good to do

43:19.680 --> 43:23.080
 and not, in terms of like safety,

43:23.080 --> 43:25.440
 is it okay to run outside and not,

43:25.440 --> 43:27.720
 is it okay to go to a restaurant and not,

43:27.720 --> 43:29.640
 I just feel like we're operating in the blind.

43:29.640 --> 43:33.880
 And then what you had is a very imperfect signal,

43:33.880 --> 43:37.160
 which is like basically politicians desperately trying

43:37.160 --> 43:40.040
 to make statements about what is safe and not.

43:40.040 --> 43:41.600
 They don't know what the heck they're doing.

43:41.600 --> 43:44.120
 They have a bunch of smart scientists telling them stuff.

43:44.120 --> 43:47.720
 And the scientists themselves also, very important,

43:47.720 --> 43:49.600
 don't always know what they're doing.

43:49.600 --> 43:54.600
 Epidemiology is not, is as much an art as a science.

43:54.600 --> 43:56.400
 You're desperately trying to predict the future,

43:56.400 --> 43:57.960
 which nobody can do.

43:57.960 --> 44:01.200
 And then you're trying to speak with some level of authority.

44:01.200 --> 44:02.920
 I mean, if I were to criticize scientists,

44:02.920 --> 44:04.440
 they spoke with too much authority.

44:04.440 --> 44:06.480
 It's okay to say, I'm not sure.

44:06.480 --> 44:10.640
 But then they think like, if I say, I'm not sure,

44:10.640 --> 44:12.400
 then there's going to be a distrust.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.480
 What they realize is when you're wrong and you say,

44:14.480 --> 44:16.840
 I'm sure, it's going to lead to more distrust.

44:16.840 --> 44:19.760
 So there's this imperfect, like just chaotic,

44:19.760 --> 44:23.560
 messy system of people trying to figure out

44:23.560 --> 44:25.320
 with very little information.

44:25.320 --> 44:27.880
 And what you're proposing is just a huge amount

44:27.880 --> 44:31.080
 of information, and information is power.

44:31.080 --> 44:34.320
 Is there challenges with adoption that you see

44:34.320 --> 44:36.240
 in the future here?

44:36.240 --> 44:38.640
 So there's, maybe we could speak to,

44:38.640 --> 44:40.520
 there's approaches, I guess, from Google.

44:40.520 --> 44:42.600
 There's different people that have tried

44:42.600 --> 44:44.800
 similar kind of ideas.

44:44.800 --> 44:49.600
 Not, you have quite a novel idea, actually.

44:49.600 --> 44:53.600
 But speaking, the umbrella idea of contact tracing,

44:53.600 --> 44:58.600
 is there something you can comment about

44:58.800 --> 45:02.040
 why their approaches haven't been fully adopted?

45:02.040 --> 45:03.200
 Is there challenges there?

45:03.200 --> 45:06.400
 Is there reasons why Novid might be a better idea

45:06.400 --> 45:09.240
 moving forward, in general, just about adoption?

45:09.240 --> 45:10.680
 Yeah, so first of all, I want to say,

45:10.680 --> 45:13.280
 I always have respect for the methods that other people use.

45:13.280 --> 45:16.160
 And so it's good to see the other people I've been trying.

45:16.160 --> 45:19.040
 But what we have noticed is that the difference

45:19.040 --> 45:22.360
 between our value proposition to the user

45:22.360 --> 45:24.320
 and the value proposition to the user delivered

45:24.320 --> 45:27.800
 by everything that was made before is that,

45:27.800 --> 45:30.480
 unfortunately, the action of installing

45:30.480 --> 45:34.480
 a standard contact tracing app will then tell you

45:34.480 --> 45:37.760
 after you have already been exposed to the disease

45:37.760 --> 45:40.640
 so that you can protect other people from you.

45:40.640 --> 45:43.640
 And what that does to your own direct probability

45:43.640 --> 45:45.720
 of getting sick, if you think about it,

45:45.720 --> 45:47.120
 suppose you were making the decision,

45:47.120 --> 45:50.040
 should I or should I not install one of those apps?

45:50.040 --> 45:53.120
 What does that do to your own probability of getting sick?

45:55.000 --> 45:56.320
 It's close to zero.

45:56.320 --> 46:00.680
 This is the sad thing you're speaking to, not sad.

46:00.680 --> 46:03.280
 I suppose it's the way the world is.

46:03.280 --> 46:06.080
 The only incentive there is to just help other people,

46:06.080 --> 46:09.640
 I suppose, but a much stronger incentive

46:09.640 --> 46:13.160
 is anything that allows you to help yourself.

46:13.160 --> 46:15.520
 Yes, so what I'm saying is that,

46:15.520 --> 46:17.160
 let's just say free market capitalism

46:17.160 --> 46:21.680
 was not based on altruism, I think it's based on,

46:21.680 --> 46:23.280
 if you make a system of incentives

46:23.280 --> 46:26.960
 so that everybody trying to maximize their own situation

46:26.960 --> 46:28.760
 somehow contributes to the whole,

46:28.760 --> 46:31.800
 that's a game theoretic solution to a very hard problem.

46:31.800 --> 46:34.200
 And so this is actually basically mechanism design,

46:34.200 --> 46:36.640
 that we've basically come up with a different mechanism,

46:36.640 --> 46:38.280
 different set of incentives,

46:38.280 --> 46:40.960
 which incentivizes the adoption,

46:40.960 --> 46:43.120
 because actually whenever we've been rolling it out,

46:43.120 --> 46:45.240
 usually the first question we ask people,

46:45.240 --> 46:46.800
 like say in a university is,

46:46.800 --> 46:48.160
 do you know what Novid does?

46:48.160 --> 46:50.640
 And most of them have read about the other apps

46:50.640 --> 46:51.920
 and they say, Oh, Novid will tell you

46:51.920 --> 46:54.120
 after you've been around someone so you can quarantine.

46:54.120 --> 46:55.400
 And we have to explain to them,

46:55.400 --> 46:58.440
 actually, Novid never wants to ask you to quarantine.

46:58.440 --> 46:59.280
 That's not the principle.

46:59.280 --> 47:01.240
 Our principle isn't based on that at all.

47:01.240 --> 47:04.560
 We just want to let you know if something is coming close

47:04.560 --> 47:06.200
 so that you can protect yourself.

47:07.360 --> 47:08.200
 If you want.

47:08.200 --> 47:09.320
 If you want, if you want, if you want.

47:09.320 --> 47:11.320
 And then the quarantine is like, yes,

47:11.320 --> 47:13.440
 in that case, if you're quarantining,

47:13.440 --> 47:16.240
 it's because you're shutting the door from the inside,

47:16.240 --> 47:17.080
 if that makes sense.

47:17.080 --> 47:18.120
 Yes, exactly.

47:18.120 --> 47:18.960
 Exactly.

47:18.960 --> 47:20.080
 I mean, this is brilliant.

47:20.080 --> 47:23.360
 So what do you think the future looks like

47:23.360 --> 47:24.560
 for future pandemics?

47:24.560 --> 47:26.680
 What's your plan with Novid?

47:26.680 --> 47:28.760
 What's your plan with these set of ideas?

47:28.760 --> 47:31.160
 I am actually still an academic and a researcher.

47:31.160 --> 47:33.360
 So the biggest work I'm working on right now

47:33.360 --> 47:35.560
 is to try to build as many collaborations

47:35.560 --> 47:39.120
 with other public health researchers at other universities

47:39.120 --> 47:42.160
 to actually work on pilot deployments together

47:42.160 --> 47:43.040
 in various places.

47:43.040 --> 47:44.080
 That's the goal.

47:44.080 --> 47:45.960
 That's actually ongoing work right now.

47:45.960 --> 47:47.800
 And so, for example, if anyone's watching this

47:47.800 --> 47:49.760
 and you happen to be a public health researcher

47:49.760 --> 47:52.360
 and you want to be involved in something like this,

47:52.360 --> 47:55.240
 I'm just gonna say, I'm still incentive thinking.

47:55.240 --> 47:57.320
 There's something in it for the researchers too.

47:57.320 --> 47:59.360
 This could open up an entire new way

47:59.360 --> 48:00.360
 of controlling disease.

48:00.360 --> 48:01.920
 That's my hope.

48:01.920 --> 48:03.560
 I mean, it might actually be true.

48:03.560 --> 48:06.360
 And people who are involved in figuring out

48:06.360 --> 48:08.040
 how to make this work,

48:08.040 --> 48:09.960
 well, it could actually be good for their careers too.

48:09.960 --> 48:11.080
 I always have to think like,

48:11.080 --> 48:12.680
 if a researcher was getting involved,

48:12.680 --> 48:14.240
 what are they getting out of it?

48:14.240 --> 48:16.600
 Oh, so you mean like from a research perspective,

48:16.600 --> 48:20.200
 you can like publications and sets of ideas

48:20.200 --> 48:25.200
 about how to, from a sort of network theory perspective,

48:27.000 --> 48:30.080
 understand how we control the spread of a pandemic.

48:30.080 --> 48:31.680
 Yes, and what I'm doing right now

48:31.680 --> 48:33.720
 is this is basically interdisciplinary research

48:33.720 --> 48:35.960
 where maybe our side is bringing the technology

48:35.960 --> 48:37.040
 and the network theory,

48:37.040 --> 48:39.200
 and the missing parts are epidemiology

48:39.200 --> 48:40.960
 and public health expertise.

48:40.960 --> 48:42.840
 And if the two things start to join,

48:42.840 --> 48:45.320
 also because everywhere that you deploy,

48:45.320 --> 48:46.800
 let's just say that the world is different

48:46.800 --> 48:49.400
 in the Philippines as it is in the United States.

48:49.400 --> 48:52.040
 And just the natures of the locality

48:52.040 --> 48:53.560
 would mean that someone like me

48:53.560 --> 48:55.280
 should not be trying to figure out how to do that.

48:55.280 --> 48:56.840
 But if we can work with the researchers

48:56.840 --> 48:57.840
 who are based there,

48:57.840 --> 48:59.720
 now suddenly we might come up with a solution

48:59.720 --> 49:01.960
 that will help scale in parts of the world

49:01.960 --> 49:04.680
 where they aren't all getting the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines

49:04.680 --> 49:07.400
 which cost like $20 a pop in the US.

49:07.400 --> 49:09.240
 So if they want to participate,

49:09.240 --> 49:10.720
 who do they reach out to?

49:10.720 --> 49:11.640
 Oh, that would just be us.

49:11.640 --> 49:13.600
 I mean, the novid.org website has...

49:13.600 --> 49:14.440
 Novid.org.

49:14.440 --> 49:16.880
 It has a feedback reach out form.

49:16.880 --> 49:18.840
 And actually we are, I mean, again,

49:18.840 --> 49:21.040
 this is the DNA of being a researcher.

49:21.040 --> 49:23.320
 I am actually very excited by the idea

49:23.320 --> 49:25.560
 that this could contribute knowledge

49:25.560 --> 49:28.240
 that will outlast all of our generations,

49:28.240 --> 49:29.960
 like all of our lifetimes.

49:29.960 --> 49:30.800
 There you go.

49:30.800 --> 49:33.200
 Reach out to novid.org.

49:34.440 --> 49:36.040
 What about individual people?

49:36.040 --> 49:37.680
 Should they install the app and try it out?

49:37.680 --> 49:40.080
 Or is this really geographically restricted?

49:40.080 --> 49:42.040
 Oh, yeah, I didn't come on here to tell everyone

49:42.040 --> 49:42.880
 to install the app.

49:42.880 --> 49:44.760
 I did not come to tell everyone to install the app

49:44.760 --> 49:46.440
 because it works best

49:46.440 --> 49:49.400
 if your local health authority is working with us.

49:49.400 --> 49:50.240
 Gotcha.

49:50.240 --> 49:51.080
 There's a reason.

49:51.080 --> 49:53.440
 It's because, this is back to the game theory.

49:54.720 --> 49:57.120
 If anyone could just say, I'm positive,

49:58.320 --> 50:01.840
 the high school senior prank would be to say that

50:01.840 --> 50:03.960
 we have a massive outbreak on finals week.

50:03.960 --> 50:05.240
 Let's not have final exams.

50:05.240 --> 50:06.640
 So the way that our system works,

50:06.640 --> 50:08.760
 it actually borrows some ideas, not borrows,

50:08.760 --> 50:10.280
 we came up with them independently.

50:10.280 --> 50:13.240
 But this idea is similar to what Google and Apple do,

50:13.240 --> 50:14.880
 which is that if the local health authority

50:14.880 --> 50:16.800
 is working with this, they can,

50:16.800 --> 50:17.960
 for everyone who's positive,

50:17.960 --> 50:20.680
 give them a passcode that expires in a short time.

50:20.680 --> 50:23.600
 So for ours, if you're on the app and saying, I'm positive,

50:23.600 --> 50:25.120
 you can either just say that,

50:25.120 --> 50:26.800
 and that's called unverified,

50:26.800 --> 50:28.360
 or you can enter in one of these codes

50:28.360 --> 50:30.280
 that you got from the local health authority.

50:30.280 --> 50:32.440
 So basically, for anyone who's watching this,

50:32.440 --> 50:34.000
 it's not that you should just go and download it

50:34.000 --> 50:35.280
 unless you want to go and look at it.

50:35.280 --> 50:36.120
 That's cool.

50:36.120 --> 50:37.480
 But if you, on the other hand,

50:37.480 --> 50:39.880
 if you happen to know anyone at the local health authority,

50:39.880 --> 50:42.640
 which is trying to figure out how to handle COVID,

50:42.640 --> 50:44.280
 well then, I mean, we'd be very happy

50:44.280 --> 50:45.560
 to also work with you.

50:46.440 --> 50:47.280
 Gotcha.

50:47.280 --> 50:49.120
 So the verified there is really important

50:49.120 --> 50:51.320
 because you're maintaining anonymity.

50:51.320 --> 50:52.160
 And because of that,

50:52.160 --> 50:54.600
 you have to have some source of verification

50:54.600 --> 50:59.080
 in order to make sure that it's not possible to manipulate

50:59.080 --> 51:02.040
 because it's ultimately about trust and information.

51:02.040 --> 51:06.120
 So it could be, verification is really important there.

51:06.120 --> 51:07.960
 So basically, individual people should

51:09.480 --> 51:11.280
 ask their local health authorities

51:11.280 --> 51:13.800
 to sign up to contact you.

51:15.040 --> 51:16.320
 I hope this spreads.

51:16.320 --> 51:18.680
 I hope this spreads for future pandemics

51:18.680 --> 51:21.440
 because I'm really, it's the amount,

51:21.440 --> 51:25.600
 the millions of people who are hurt by this,

51:25.600 --> 51:28.720
 I think our response to the virus,

51:28.720 --> 51:30.040
 economically speaking,

51:30.040 --> 51:32.520
 the number of people who lost their dream,

51:32.520 --> 51:35.120
 lost their jobs, but also lost their dream.

51:35.120 --> 51:38.400
 Entrepreneurs, jobs often give meaning.

51:38.400 --> 51:41.080
 There's people who financially and psychologically

51:41.080 --> 51:42.760
 are suffering because of our,

51:43.760 --> 51:47.440
 I'll say, incompetent response to the virus

51:47.440 --> 51:49.760
 across the world, but certainly the United States,

51:49.760 --> 51:53.960
 that should be the beacon of entrepreneurial hope

51:53.960 --> 51:54.800
 for the world.

51:54.800 --> 51:59.800
 So I hope that we'll be able to respond

52:00.600 --> 52:02.760
 to these kinds of events much better in the future.

52:02.760 --> 52:05.040
 And this is exactly the right kind of idea.

52:05.040 --> 52:07.240
 And now is the time to do the investment.

52:08.280 --> 52:13.040
 Let's step back to the beauty of mathematics.

52:13.040 --> 52:16.040
 Maybe ask the big, silly question first,

52:16.040 --> 52:19.800
 which is, what do you find beautiful about mathematics?

52:20.840 --> 52:25.840
 I think that being able to look at a complicated problem,

52:26.880 --> 52:28.560
 which looks unsolvable,

52:28.560 --> 52:30.800
 and then to be able to change the perspective

52:30.800 --> 52:32.480
 to come from a different angle

52:32.480 --> 52:36.160
 and suddenly see that there's a nice solution.

52:36.160 --> 52:37.920
 I don't mean that every problem in math

52:37.920 --> 52:39.160
 is supposed to be this way,

52:39.160 --> 52:40.920
 but I think that these reframings

52:40.920 --> 52:42.160
 and changing of perspectives

52:42.160 --> 52:44.640
 that cause difficult things to get simplified

52:44.640 --> 52:48.600
 and crystallized and factored in certain ways is beautiful.

52:48.600 --> 52:50.920
 Actually, that's related to what we were just talking about

52:50.920 --> 52:52.640
 with even this fighting pandemics.

52:52.640 --> 52:57.640
 The crystal idea was just quantify proximity

52:57.840 --> 53:01.680
 by the number of relationships in the physical network,

53:01.680 --> 53:04.960
 instead of just by the feet and meters, right?

53:04.960 --> 53:07.360
 It's just that if you change that perspective,

53:07.360 --> 53:09.240
 now all of these things follow.

53:09.240 --> 53:12.280
 And so mathematics to me is beautiful

53:12.280 --> 53:15.000
 in the pure sense just for that.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.560
 Yeah, it's quite interesting to see a human civilization

53:17.560 --> 53:20.040
 as a network, as a graph,

53:20.040 --> 53:25.040
 and our relationships as kind of edges in that graph.

53:25.240 --> 53:29.360
 And to then do, outside of just pandemic,

53:29.360 --> 53:31.880
 do interesting inferences based on that.

53:33.760 --> 53:36.920
 This is true for like Twitter, social networks and so on,

53:36.920 --> 53:40.080
 how we expand the kind of things we talk about,

53:40.080 --> 53:42.200
 think about sort of politically,

53:42.200 --> 53:44.680
 if you have this little bubble, quote unquote,

53:44.680 --> 53:46.880
 of ideas that you play with,

53:46.880 --> 53:50.200
 it's nice from a recommender system perspective,

53:50.200 --> 53:52.000
 how do you jump out of those bubbles?

53:52.000 --> 53:53.600
 It's really fascinating.

53:53.600 --> 53:57.520
 YouTube was working on that, Twitter's working on that,

53:57.520 --> 53:59.680
 but not always so successfully,

53:59.680 --> 54:02.680
 but there's a lot of interesting work

54:02.680 --> 54:05.160
 from a mathematical and a psychological,

54:05.160 --> 54:08.560
 sociological perspective there within those graphs.

54:09.520 --> 54:13.360
 But if we look at the cleanest formulation of that,

54:13.360 --> 54:16.280
 of looking at a problem from a different perspective,

54:16.280 --> 54:17.360
 you're also involved

54:17.360 --> 54:20.200
 with the International Mathematics Olympiad,

54:20.200 --> 54:27.640
 which takes small, clean problems that are really hard,

54:27.640 --> 54:31.120
 but once you look at them differently, can become easy.

54:31.120 --> 54:36.320
 But that little jump of innovation is the entire trick.

54:36.320 --> 54:38.560
 So maybe at the high level,

54:38.560 --> 54:41.480
 can you say what is the International Mathematical Olympiad?

54:41.480 --> 54:44.600
 Sure, so this is the competition

54:44.600 --> 54:47.840
 for people who aren't yet in college, math competition,

54:47.840 --> 54:50.720
 which is the most prestigious one in the entire world.

54:50.720 --> 54:52.720
 It's the Olympics of mathematics,

54:52.720 --> 54:55.040
 but only for people who aren't yet in college.

54:55.040 --> 54:58.000
 Now, the kinds of questions that they ask you to do

54:58.000 --> 54:59.600
 are not computational.

54:59.600 --> 55:02.400
 Usually you're not supposed to find that the answer is 42.

55:02.400 --> 55:03.760
 Right?

55:03.760 --> 55:07.280
 Instead, you're supposed to explain why something is true.

55:07.280 --> 55:09.840
 And the problem is that at the beginning,

55:09.840 --> 55:11.560
 when you look at each of the questions,

55:11.560 --> 55:13.560
 first of all, you have four and a half hours

55:13.560 --> 55:16.080
 to solve three questions, and this is one day,

55:16.080 --> 55:16.920
 and then you have a second day,

55:16.920 --> 55:19.360
 which is four and a half hours, three questions.

55:19.360 --> 55:20.600
 But when you look at the questions,

55:20.600 --> 55:21.440
 they're all asking you,

55:21.440 --> 55:23.240
 explain why the following thing is true,

55:23.240 --> 55:25.160
 which you've never seen before.

55:25.160 --> 55:27.360
 And by the way, even though there are six questions,

55:27.360 --> 55:29.120
 if you solve any one of them, you're a genius

55:29.120 --> 55:30.320
 and you get an honorable mention.

55:30.320 --> 55:32.560
 So this is hard to solve.

55:32.560 --> 55:35.280
 So what about, is it one person, is it a team?

55:35.280 --> 55:38.720
 Ah, so each country can send six people

55:38.720 --> 55:42.320
 and the score of the country is actually unofficial.

55:42.320 --> 55:45.360
 There's not an official country versus country system,

55:45.360 --> 55:47.480
 although everyone just adds up the point scores

55:47.480 --> 55:48.760
 of the six people and they say,

55:48.760 --> 55:51.440
 well, now which country stacked up where?

55:51.440 --> 55:53.400
 Yeah, so maybe as a side comment,

55:53.400 --> 55:56.560
 I should say that there's a bunch of countries,

55:56.560 --> 55:59.480
 including the former Soviet Union and Russia,

55:59.480 --> 56:03.440
 where I grew up, where this is one of the

56:04.320 --> 56:08.360
 most important competitions that the country participates in.

56:08.360 --> 56:11.880
 It was a source of pride for a lot of the country.

56:11.880 --> 56:14.400
 You look at the Olympic sports,

56:14.400 --> 56:17.080
 like wrestling, weightlifting,

56:17.080 --> 56:20.280
 there's certain sports and hockey

56:20.280 --> 56:24.960
 that Russia and the Soviet Union truly took pride in.

56:24.960 --> 56:28.600
 And actually the Mathematical Olympiad,

56:28.600 --> 56:30.880
 it was one of them for many years.

56:30.880 --> 56:32.560
 It's still one of them.

56:32.560 --> 56:33.720
 And that's kind of fascinating.

56:33.720 --> 56:36.680
 We don't think about it this way in the United States.

56:36.680 --> 56:38.200
 Maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong,

56:38.200 --> 56:42.360
 but it's not nearly as popular in the United States

56:42.360 --> 56:45.560
 in terms of its integration into the culture,

56:45.560 --> 56:49.080
 into just basic conversation, into the pride.

56:49.080 --> 56:52.360
 Like, if you won an Olympic gold medal

56:52.360 --> 56:56.080
 or if you win the Super Bowl, you can walk around proud.

56:56.080 --> 56:57.040
 I think that was the case

56:57.040 --> 56:59.200
 with the Mathematical Olympiad in Russia.

56:59.200 --> 57:03.040
 Not as much the case in the United States, I think.

57:03.040 --> 57:04.880
 So I just wanna give that a little aside

57:04.880 --> 57:07.520
 because beating anybody from Russia,

57:07.520 --> 57:09.400
 from the Eastern Republic or from China

57:09.400 --> 57:11.840
 is very, very difficult.

57:11.840 --> 57:13.520
 Like, if I remember correctly,

57:14.880 --> 57:18.880
 there's people, this was a multiyear training process.

57:18.880 --> 57:20.680
 They train hard.

57:20.680 --> 57:25.040
 And this is everything that they're focused on.

57:25.040 --> 57:29.320
 My dad was a participant in this.

57:29.320 --> 57:33.120
 And it's, I mean, it's as serious as Olympic sports.

57:33.120 --> 57:34.520
 You think about like gymnastics,

57:34.520 --> 57:36.600
 like young athletes participating in gymnastics.

57:36.600 --> 57:38.920
 This is as serious as that, if not more serious.

57:38.920 --> 57:41.360
 So I just wanna give that a little bit of context

57:41.360 --> 57:44.640
 because we're talking about serious high level math,

57:44.640 --> 57:46.360
 athletics almost here.

57:46.360 --> 57:49.800
 Yeah, and actually I also think that it made sense

57:49.800 --> 57:51.400
 from the Soviet Union's perspective

57:51.400 --> 57:55.480
 because if you look at what these people do eventually,

57:55.480 --> 57:58.800
 even though, let's look at the USSR's

57:58.800 --> 58:00.600
 International Math Olympiad record.

58:00.600 --> 58:03.080
 Even though they, I say, even though they won

58:03.080 --> 58:05.280
 a lot of awards at the high school thing,

58:05.280 --> 58:07.800
 many of them went on to do incredible things

58:07.800 --> 58:10.600
 in research mathematics or research other things.

58:10.600 --> 58:13.000
 And that's showing the generalization,

58:13.000 --> 58:15.960
 generalizability of what they were working on.

58:15.960 --> 58:20.160
 Because ultimately we're just playing with ideas

58:20.160 --> 58:22.360
 of how to prove things.

58:22.360 --> 58:26.040
 And if you get pretty good at inventing creative ways

58:26.040 --> 58:29.040
 to turn problems apart, split them apart,

58:29.040 --> 58:34.040
 observe neat ways to turn messy things into simple crystals.

58:34.080 --> 58:36.200
 Well, if you're gonna try to solve any real problem

58:36.200 --> 58:39.240
 in the real world, that could be a really handy tool too.

58:39.240 --> 58:41.160
 So I don't think it was a bad investment.

58:41.160 --> 58:44.920
 I think it clearly worked well for Soviet Union.

58:44.920 --> 58:47.120
 Yeah, so this is interesting.

58:47.120 --> 58:48.600
 People sometimes ask me, you know,

58:48.600 --> 58:52.080
 you go up and under communism, you know,

58:52.080 --> 58:54.040
 was there anything good about communism?

58:55.560 --> 58:58.120
 And it's difficult for me to talk about it

58:58.120 --> 59:00.800
 because it's not, communism is one of those things

59:00.800 --> 59:02.920
 that's looked down on like without,

59:02.920 --> 59:05.360
 in absolutist terms currently.

59:05.360 --> 59:07.360
 But you could still, in my perspective,

59:07.360 --> 59:09.520
 talk about the actual, forget communism

59:09.520 --> 59:11.760
 or whatever the actual term is,

59:11.760 --> 59:16.760
 but you know, certain ways that the society functioned

59:16.760 --> 59:18.120
 that we can learn lessons from.

59:18.120 --> 59:20.280
 And one of the things in the Soviet Union

59:20.280 --> 59:25.160
 that was highly prized is knowledge,

59:25.160 --> 59:27.280
 not even knowledge, it's wisdom

59:27.280 --> 59:32.280
 and the skill of invention, of innovation at a young age.

59:34.120 --> 59:37.240
 So we're not talking about a selection process

59:37.240 --> 59:40.440
 where you pick the best students in the school

59:40.440 --> 59:44.120
 to do the mathematics or to read literature.

59:44.120 --> 59:47.000
 It's like, everybody did it.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.920
 Everybody, it was almost treated

59:49.920 --> 59:53.000
 as if anyone could be the next Einstein,

59:53.000 --> 59:55.560
 anybody could be the next, I don't know,

59:55.560 --> 59:56.920
 Hemingway, James Joyce.

59:56.920 --> 1:00:01.200
 And so you're forcing an education on the populace

1:00:01.200 --> 1:00:03.960
 and a rigorous deep education,

1:00:03.960 --> 1:00:06.440
 like as opposed to kind of like,

1:00:06.440 --> 1:00:10.320
 oh, we wanna make sure we teach

1:00:10.320 --> 1:00:12.440
 to the weakest student in the class,

1:00:14.240 --> 1:00:16.960
 which American systems can sometimes do

1:00:16.960 --> 1:00:19.360
 because we don't wanna leave anyone behind.

1:00:19.360 --> 1:00:24.360
 The Russian system was anyone can be the strongest student

1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:26.840
 and we're gonna teach you the strongest student

1:00:26.840 --> 1:00:30.840
 and we're going to pretend or force everybody,

1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:32.880
 even the weakest student to be strong.

1:00:32.880 --> 1:00:35.240
 And what that results in, it's obviously,

1:00:35.240 --> 1:00:36.480
 this is what people talk about,

1:00:36.480 --> 1:00:38.120
 is a huge amount of pressure.

1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:40.640
 Like it's psychologically very difficult.

1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:42.640
 This is why people struggle when they go to MIT,

1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:44.400
 this very competitive environment.

1:00:44.400 --> 1:00:46.080
 It can be very psychologically difficult,

1:00:46.080 --> 1:00:47.360
 but at the same time,

1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:49.800
 it's bringing out the best out of people.

1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:53.200
 And that mathematics was certainly one of those things.

1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:54.640
 And exactly what you're saying,

1:00:54.640 --> 1:00:56.360
 which kind of clicked with me just now,

1:00:56.360 --> 1:01:00.760
 as opposed to kind of a spelling bee in the United States,

1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:03.360
 which I guess you spell, I'm horrible at this,

1:01:03.360 --> 1:01:04.960
 but it's a competition about spelling,

1:01:04.960 --> 1:01:07.160
 which I'm not sure, but you could argue

1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:10.000
 it doesn't generalize well to the future skills.

1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:13.320
 Mathematics, especially this kind of mathematics

1:01:13.320 --> 1:01:17.120
 is essentially formalized competition of invention,

1:01:17.120 --> 1:01:21.760
 of creating new ideas.

1:01:21.760 --> 1:01:23.960
 And that generalizes really, really well.

1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:25.800
 So that's quite brilliantly put.

1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:27.320
 I didn't really think about that.

1:01:27.320 --> 1:01:29.160
 So this is not just about the competition.

1:01:29.160 --> 1:01:31.960
 This is about developing minds

1:01:31.960 --> 1:01:36.960
 that will come to do some incredible stuff in the future.

1:01:37.280 --> 1:01:38.640
 Yeah, actually, I want to respond

1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:39.600
 to a couple of things there.

1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:42.000
 The first one, this one, which is this notion

1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:43.800
 of whether or not that is possible

1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:46.280
 in a non authoritarian regime.

1:01:46.280 --> 1:01:47.120
 I think it is.

1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:49.520
 And that's actually why I spent some of my efforts

1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:51.040
 before the COVID thing,

1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:53.240
 actually trying to work towards there.

1:01:53.240 --> 1:01:55.680
 The reason is because if you think about it,

1:01:55.680 --> 1:01:57.360
 let's say in America,

1:01:57.360 --> 1:01:58.840
 lots of people are pretty serious

1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:01.160
 about training very hard for football,

1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:02.520
 or baseball, or basketball.

1:02:02.520 --> 1:02:04.040
 Basketball is very, very accessible,

1:02:04.040 --> 1:02:05.840
 but lots of people are doing that.

1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:06.680
 Why?

1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:09.880
 Well, actually, I think that what was going on

1:02:09.880 --> 1:02:13.520
 with the authoritarian thing was at least the message

1:02:13.520 --> 1:02:17.880
 that was universally sent was being a good thinker

1:02:17.880 --> 1:02:21.800
 and a creator of ideas is a good thing.

1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:23.360
 Yes, exactly.

1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:26.920
 There's no reason why that message can't be sent everywhere.

1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:28.680
 And I think it actually should be.

1:02:28.680 --> 1:02:29.720
 So that's the first thing.

1:02:29.720 --> 1:02:32.600
 The second thing is what you commented about this thing

1:02:32.600 --> 1:02:35.720
 about the generalizable skill

1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:37.960
 and what could people do with Olympiads afterwards.

1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:40.360
 So that's actually my interest in the whole thing.

1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:45.360
 I don't just coach students how to do problems.

1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:47.160
 In fact, I'm not even the best person for that.

1:02:47.160 --> 1:02:49.480
 I'm not the best at solving these problems.

1:02:49.480 --> 1:02:50.800
 There are other people who are much better

1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:53.320
 at making problems and teaching people how to solve problems.

1:02:53.320 --> 1:02:57.160
 In fact, when the Mathematical Association of America,

1:02:57.160 --> 1:02:58.640
 which is the group which is in charge

1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:01.280
 of the US participation in these Olympiads,

1:03:01.280 --> 1:03:04.320
 when they were deciding whether or not to put me in

1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:06.920
 back in 2013 as the head coach,

1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:09.240
 I had a conversation with their executive director

1:03:09.240 --> 1:03:12.680
 where I commented that we might do worse

1:03:12.680 --> 1:03:15.080
 because my position was I don't,

1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:17.680
 I mean, I actually didn't want to focus on winning.

1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:19.840
 I said, if you're going to let me work

1:03:19.840 --> 1:03:24.400
 with 60 very strong minds as picked through this system,

1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:26.080
 because the coach works with these,

1:03:26.080 --> 1:03:27.680
 gets to run a camp for these students.

1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:30.400
 I said, I'm actually not going to define my success

1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:33.080
 in terms of winning this contest.

1:03:33.080 --> 1:03:36.040
 I said, I wanted to maximize the number of the students

1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:39.120
 that I read about in the New York Times in 20 years.

1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:41.520
 And the executive director

1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:44.000
 of the Mathematical Association of America

1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:45.840
 was fully in support of this

1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:48.000
 because that's also how their philosophy is.

1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:49.840
 So in America, the way we run this

1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:52.920
 is we're actually not just training to win,

1:03:52.920 --> 1:03:54.840
 even though the students are very good

1:03:54.840 --> 1:03:56.440
 and they can win anyway.

1:03:56.440 --> 1:03:59.120
 One reason, for example, I went and even did the COVID thing

1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:00.560
 involving quite a few of them

1:04:01.560 --> 1:04:04.280
 is so that hopefully some of them get ideas

1:04:04.280 --> 1:04:06.520
 because in 20, 30 years, I won't have the energy

1:04:06.520 --> 1:04:08.520
 or the insight to solve problems.

1:04:08.520 --> 1:04:10.480
 We'll have another catastrophe.

1:04:10.480 --> 1:04:13.160
 And hopefully some of these people will step up and do it.

1:04:13.160 --> 1:04:14.960
 And ultimately have that longterm impact.

1:04:14.960 --> 1:04:17.280
 I wonder if this is scalable to,

1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:20.320
 because that's such a great metric for education,

1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:27.320
 not how to get an A on the test, but how to have,

1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:31.320
 how to be on the cover of New York Times

1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:32.760
 for inventing something new.

1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:37.360
 And do you think that's generalizable to education

1:04:37.360 --> 1:04:39.080
 beyond just this particular Olympia?

1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:42.760
 Like, even you saying this feels like a rare statement,

1:04:42.760 --> 1:04:45.920
 almost like a radical statement as a goal for education.

1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:48.800
 So actually the way I teach my classes at Carnegie Mellon,

1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:51.280
 which I will admit right away is not equivalent

1:04:51.280 --> 1:04:52.440
 to the average in the world,

1:04:52.440 --> 1:04:56.280
 but it's already not just the top 60 in the country

1:04:56.280 --> 1:04:58.120
 as picked by something.

1:04:58.120 --> 1:04:58.960
 Let me just explain.

1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:01.480
 I have exams in my class, which are 90% of the grade.

1:05:01.480 --> 1:05:02.840
 So the exams are the whole thing,

1:05:02.840 --> 1:05:03.920
 or most of the whole thing.

1:05:03.920 --> 1:05:06.640
 And the way that I let students prepare for the exams

1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:08.880
 is I show them all the problems I've ever given

1:05:08.880 --> 1:05:10.360
 on the previous exams.

1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:12.680
 And the exam that they will take is open notes.

1:05:12.680 --> 1:05:13.760
 They can take all the notes they want

1:05:13.760 --> 1:05:14.800
 on the previous problems.

1:05:14.800 --> 1:05:17.240
 And the guarantee is that the exam problems this time

1:05:17.240 --> 1:05:18.840
 will have no overlap with anything

1:05:18.840 --> 1:05:21.000
 you have seen me give in the past,

1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:24.400
 as well as no overlap with anything I taught in the class.

1:05:24.400 --> 1:05:26.080
 So the entire exam is invention.

1:05:27.360 --> 1:05:28.600
 Wow.

1:05:28.600 --> 1:05:29.760
 But that's how I go, right?

1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:33.240
 My point is I have explained to people when I teach you,

1:05:33.240 --> 1:05:36.720
 I don't want you to have remembered a method I showed you.

1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:39.320
 I want you to have learned enough about this area

1:05:39.320 --> 1:05:40.880
 that if you face a new question,

1:05:40.880 --> 1:05:42.480
 which I came up with the night before

1:05:42.480 --> 1:05:43.640
 by thinking about like,

1:05:43.640 --> 1:05:46.200
 what could I ask that I have never asked before?

1:05:46.200 --> 1:05:47.040
 Oh, that's cute.

1:05:47.040 --> 1:05:48.040
 That's what the answer is.

1:05:48.040 --> 1:05:49.160
 Aha, that's an exam problem.

1:05:49.160 --> 1:05:51.320
 That's exactly what I do before the exam.

1:05:51.320 --> 1:05:53.840
 And then that's what I want them to learn.

1:05:53.840 --> 1:05:56.080
 And the first exam, usually people have a rough time

1:05:56.080 --> 1:05:58.400
 because it's like, what kind of crazy class is this?

1:05:58.400 --> 1:06:01.920
 The professor doesn't teach you anything for the exam.

1:06:01.920 --> 1:06:03.440
 But then by the second or third,

1:06:03.440 --> 1:06:05.280
 and by the time they finished the class,

1:06:05.280 --> 1:06:09.520
 they have learned how to solve anything in the area.

1:06:09.520 --> 1:06:10.360
 How to invent.

1:06:10.360 --> 1:06:12.240
 How to invent in that area, yeah.

1:06:12.240 --> 1:06:15.520
 Can we walk back to the Mathematical Olympiad?

1:06:15.520 --> 1:06:17.560
 What's the scoring and format like?

1:06:18.520 --> 1:06:20.840
 And also what does it take to win?

1:06:20.840 --> 1:06:24.280
 So the way it works is that each of the six students

1:06:25.640 --> 1:06:27.800
 do the problems and there are six problems.

1:06:27.800 --> 1:06:29.560
 All the problems are equally weighted.

1:06:29.560 --> 1:06:31.480
 So each one's worth seven points.

1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:33.400
 That means that your maximum score

1:06:33.400 --> 1:06:35.000
 is six problems times seven points,

1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.480
 which is the nice number of 42.

1:06:37.480 --> 1:06:40.360
 And now the way that they're scored by the way

1:06:40.360 --> 1:06:41.680
 is there's partial credit.

1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:43.200
 So the question is asking you,

1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:46.360
 explain why this weird fact is true.

1:06:46.360 --> 1:06:48.720
 Okay, if you explain why you get seven points.

1:06:48.720 --> 1:06:51.320
 If you make minor mistake, maybe you get six points.

1:06:51.320 --> 1:06:53.840
 But if you don't succeed in explaining why,

1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:57.960
 but you explain some other true fact,

1:06:57.960 --> 1:07:02.200
 which is along the way of proving it,

1:07:02.200 --> 1:07:03.960
 then you get partial credit.

1:07:03.960 --> 1:07:05.680
 And actually now this is tricky

1:07:05.680 --> 1:07:07.640
 because how do you score such a thing?

1:07:07.640 --> 1:07:10.800
 It's not like the answer was 72

1:07:10.800 --> 1:07:13.160
 and you wrote 71 and it's close, right?

1:07:13.160 --> 1:07:15.280
 The answer is 72 and you wrote 36.

1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:16.200
 Oh, but that's pretty close

1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:18.880
 because maybe you're just off by it.

1:07:18.880 --> 1:07:20.400
 By the way, they're not numerical anyway,

1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:22.680
 but I'm just giving some numerical analog

1:07:22.680 --> 1:07:24.560
 to the way the scoring might work.

1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:25.840
 They're all essays.

1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:28.240
 And that's where I guess I have some role

1:07:28.240 --> 1:07:29.320
 as well as some other people

1:07:29.320 --> 1:07:32.360
 who helped me in the US delegation for coaches.

1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:37.360
 We actually debate with the country which is organizing it.

1:07:37.560 --> 1:07:39.480
 The country which is organizing the Olympiad

1:07:39.480 --> 1:07:44.480
 brings about 50 people to help judge the written solutions.

1:07:45.160 --> 1:07:48.360
 And you schedule these half hour appointments

1:07:48.360 --> 1:07:50.520
 where the delegation from one country

1:07:50.520 --> 1:07:52.360
 sits down at a table like this.

1:07:52.360 --> 1:07:55.520
 Opposite side is two or three people from the host country.

1:07:55.520 --> 1:07:58.000
 And they're just looking over these exam papers

1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:00.640
 saying, well, how many points is this worth

1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:03.120
 based on some rubric that has been designed?

1:08:03.120 --> 1:08:05.600
 And this is a negotiation process

1:08:05.600 --> 1:08:07.760
 where we're not trying to bargain

1:08:07.760 --> 1:08:09.320
 and get the best score we can.

1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:10.880
 In fact, sometimes we go to this table

1:08:10.880 --> 1:08:13.960
 and we will say, we think we want less than what you gave us.

1:08:13.960 --> 1:08:16.280
 This is how our, these are our principles.

1:08:16.280 --> 1:08:18.800
 If you give us too much, we say, no, you gave us too much.

1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:19.720
 We do that.

1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:22.280
 However, the reason why this is an interesting process

1:08:22.280 --> 1:08:24.160
 is because if you can imagine every country

1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:26.760
 which is participating has its own language.

1:08:26.760 --> 1:08:28.760
 And so if you're trying to grade the Mongolian scripts

1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:31.040
 and they're written in Mongolian,

1:08:31.040 --> 1:08:33.520
 if you don't read Mongolian, which most people don't,

1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:36.680
 then the coaches are explaining to you,

1:08:36.680 --> 1:08:38.760
 this is what the student has written.

1:08:38.760 --> 1:08:40.480
 It's actually quite interesting process.

1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:43.400
 So it's almost like a jury.

1:08:43.400 --> 1:08:44.240
 Yes.

1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:47.120
 You have, in the American legal system,

1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:49.880
 you have a jury that where they're deliberating,

1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:53.640
 but unlike a jury, there's the members of the jury

1:08:53.640 --> 1:08:55.800
 speaking different languages sometimes.

1:08:55.800 --> 1:08:57.120
 Yes. That's fascinating.

1:08:57.120 --> 1:09:01.640
 But I mean, it's hard to know what to do

1:09:01.640 --> 1:09:04.560
 because it's probably really, really competitive.

1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:08.560
 But your sense is that ultimately people,

1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:13.560
 like how do you prevent manipulation here, right?

1:09:14.240 --> 1:09:17.000
 Well, we just hope that it's not happening.

1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.240
 So we write in English.

1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:21.400
 Therefore, everything that the US does,

1:09:21.400 --> 1:09:22.800
 everyone can look at.

1:09:22.800 --> 1:09:24.120
 So it's very hard for me.

1:09:24.120 --> 1:09:25.720
 It's very hard for you to manipulate.

1:09:25.720 --> 1:09:27.480
 We don't manipulate.

1:09:27.480 --> 1:09:29.360
 We only hope that other people aren't.

1:09:29.360 --> 1:09:32.320
 But at the same time, as you see, our philosophy was,

1:09:32.320 --> 1:09:35.560
 we want to use this as a way to develop general talent.

1:09:35.560 --> 1:09:38.560
 And although we do this for the six people who go

1:09:38.560 --> 1:09:40.640
 to the International Math Olympiad,

1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:42.880
 we really want that everyone at any,

1:09:42.880 --> 1:09:45.080
 touched at any stage of this process

1:09:45.080 --> 1:09:48.120
 get some skills that can help to contribute more later.

1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:51.520
 So I don't know if you can say something insightful

1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:52.560
 to this question,

1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:56.200
 but what do you think makes a really hard math problem

1:09:56.200 --> 1:09:59.760
 on this Olympiad, maybe in the courses you teach

1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:01.080
 or in general?

1:10:01.080 --> 1:10:03.520
 What makes for a hard problem?

1:10:03.520 --> 1:10:06.280
 You've seen, I'm sure, a lot of really difficult problems.

1:10:06.280 --> 1:10:07.880
 What makes a hard problem?

1:10:07.880 --> 1:10:12.160
 So I could quantify it by the number of leaps of insight

1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:14.480
 of changes of perspective that are along the way.

1:10:14.480 --> 1:10:15.800
 And here's why.

1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:17.560
 This is like a very theoretical computer science

1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:19.080
 way of looking at it, okay?

1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:22.520
 It's that each reframing of the problem

1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:23.840
 and using of some tool,

1:10:23.840 --> 1:10:25.360
 I actually call that a leap of insight.

1:10:25.360 --> 1:10:27.400
 When you say, oh, wow, now I see,

1:10:27.400 --> 1:10:30.480
 I should kind of put these plugs into those sockets

1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:33.600
 like so, and suddenly I get to use that machine.

1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:34.920
 Oh, but I'm not done yet.

1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:36.160
 Now I need to do it again.

1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:38.960
 Each such step is a large possible,

1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:41.120
 large fan out in the search space.

1:10:41.120 --> 1:10:44.040
 The number of these tells you the exponent.

1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:46.600
 The base of the exponent is like how big,

1:10:46.600 --> 1:10:49.360
 how many different possibilities you could try.

1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:51.200
 And that's actually why,

1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:54.240
 like if you have a three insight problem,

1:10:54.240 --> 1:10:57.560
 that is not three times as hard as a one insight problem,

1:10:57.560 --> 1:10:59.080
 because after you've made the one insight,

1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:03.000
 it's not clear that that was the right track necessarily.

1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:03.840
 Well, unless you're very into it.

1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:06.400
 There's still a branching of possibility.

1:11:06.400 --> 1:11:07.240
 Yeah.

1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:08.080
 Right.

1:11:09.800 --> 1:11:12.280
 You're saying there's problems like on the math Olympia

1:11:12.280 --> 1:11:13.680
 that requires more than one insight?

1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:14.520
 Yes.

1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:15.360
 Those are the hard ones.

1:11:15.360 --> 1:11:17.560
 And also I can tell you how you can tell.

1:11:17.560 --> 1:11:19.760
 So this is how I also taught myself math

1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:20.720
 when I was in college.

1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:23.520
 So if you are taking a, not taught myself,

1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:24.840
 I was taking classes, of course,

1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:26.720
 but I was trying to read the textbook

1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:29.480
 and I found out I was very bad at reading math textbooks.

1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:32.760
 A math textbook has a long page of stuff that is all true,

1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:34.040
 which after you read the page,

1:11:34.040 --> 1:11:35.640
 you have no idea what you just read.

1:11:35.640 --> 1:11:36.480
 Yeah.

1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:39.120
 This is just a good summary of a math textbook.

1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:39.960
 Okay.

1:11:39.960 --> 1:11:44.120
 Yeah, because it's not clear why anything was done that way.

1:11:44.120 --> 1:11:45.400
 And yes, everything is true,

1:11:45.400 --> 1:11:47.360
 but how the heck did anyone think of that?

1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:50.840
 So the way that I taught myself math eventually was,

1:11:50.840 --> 1:11:52.960
 the way I read a math textbook

1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:55.640
 is I would look at the theorem statement.

1:11:55.640 --> 1:11:58.920
 I would look at the length of the proof

1:11:58.920 --> 1:12:00.000
 and then I would close the book

1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:01.280
 and attempt to reproof it myself.

1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:02.120
 Yeah.

1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:03.520
 That's brilliant.

1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:05.520
 The length of the proof is telling you

1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:06.800
 the number of insights,

1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:08.760
 because the length of the proof is linear

1:12:08.760 --> 1:12:10.640
 in the number of insights.

1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:12.200
 Each insight takes space.

1:12:12.200 --> 1:12:13.040
 Yeah.

1:12:13.040 --> 1:12:14.640
 And if I know that it's a short proof,

1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:16.080
 I know that there's only one insight.

1:12:16.080 --> 1:12:19.000
 So when I'm doing my own way of solving the problem,

1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:20.520
 like finding the proof,

1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:23.080
 I quit if I have to do too many plugins.

1:12:23.080 --> 1:12:24.880
 It's equivalent to a math contest.

1:12:24.880 --> 1:12:25.800
 In a math contest I look,

1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:27.200
 is it problem one, two, or three?

1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:28.920
 That tells me how many insights there are.

1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:29.960
 This is exactly what I did.

1:12:29.960 --> 1:12:30.880
 That's brilliant.

1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:32.080
 Linear in the number.

1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:32.920
 I don't know.

1:12:32.920 --> 1:12:36.320
 I think it's possible that that's true.

1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:37.160
 Approximately, approximately.

1:12:37.160 --> 1:12:38.480
 Approximately, yeah.

1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:41.320
 I don't know if somebody out there

1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:43.040
 is gonna try to formally prove this.

1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:44.160
 Oh no, I mean, you're right.

1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:46.040
 There are cases where maybe it's not quite linear,

1:12:46.040 --> 1:12:47.040
 but in general.

1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:48.360
 Well, some of it's notation too,

1:12:48.360 --> 1:12:50.920
 and some of it is style and all those kinds of things,

1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:51.880
 but within a textbook.

1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:52.720
 Within the same book.

1:12:52.720 --> 1:12:54.040
 Within the same book with the same.

1:12:54.040 --> 1:12:56.160
 Within the same book on the same subject.

1:12:56.160 --> 1:12:57.000
 Yeah.

1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:57.840
 This is what I was using.

1:12:57.840 --> 1:12:58.760
 That's hilarious.

1:12:58.760 --> 1:13:00.360
 Because you know, if it's a two page proof,

1:13:00.360 --> 1:13:02.760
 you just know this is gonna be insane, right?

1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:06.880
 That's the scary thing about insights.

1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:08.200
 You look like Andrew Wiles

1:13:08.200 --> 1:13:10.160
 working on the Fermat's Last Theorem,

1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:13.560
 is you don't know.

1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:16.200
 Something seems like a good idea,

1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:17.280
 and you have that idea,

1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:19.240
 and it feels like this is a leap,

1:13:20.160 --> 1:13:22.280
 like a totally new way to see it,

1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:25.760
 but you have no idea if it's at all useful.

1:13:25.760 --> 1:13:27.000
 Even if you think it's correct,

1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:30.120
 you have no idea if this is like going to go down a path

1:13:30.120 --> 1:13:32.480
 that's completely counterproductive

1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:34.520
 or not productive at all.

1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:38.400
 That's the crappy thing about invention,

1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:41.080
 is like I have, I'm sure you do.

1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:44.640
 I have a lot of really good ideas every single day,

1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:49.600
 but like, and I'll go inside my head along them,

1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:52.040
 along that little trajectory,

1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:54.640
 but it could be just a total waste.

1:13:54.640 --> 1:13:57.200
 And it's, you know what that feels like?

1:13:57.200 --> 1:13:59.480
 It just feels like patience is required,

1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:01.800
 not to get excited at any one thing.

1:14:01.800 --> 1:14:03.360
 So I think this is interesting

1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:04.800
 because you raised Andrew Wiles.

1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:08.400
 He spent seven years attacking the same thing, right?

1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:10.360
 And so I think that what attracts

1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:12.320
 professional researchers to this

1:14:12.320 --> 1:14:14.880
 is because even though it's very painful

1:14:14.880 --> 1:14:16.680
 that you keep fighting with something,

1:14:16.680 --> 1:14:19.480
 when you finally find the right insights

1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:20.680
 and string them together,

1:14:20.680 --> 1:14:23.080
 it feels really good, so.

1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:26.040
 Well, there's also like short term,

1:14:26.040 --> 1:14:31.040
 it feels good to, whether it's real or not,

1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:33.560
 to pretend like you've solved something

1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:35.400
 in the sense like you have an insight

1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:37.960
 and there's a sense like this might be the insight

1:14:37.960 --> 1:14:39.000
 that solves it.

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:44.000
 So at least for me, I just enjoy that rush of positivity

1:14:44.440 --> 1:14:46.440
 even though I know statistically speaking

1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:48.520
 is probably going to be a dead end.

1:14:48.520 --> 1:14:49.840
 I'm the same way, I'm the same way.

1:14:49.840 --> 1:14:51.560
 In fact, that's how I know whether

1:14:51.560 --> 1:14:54.320
 I might want to keep thinking about this general problem.

1:14:54.320 --> 1:14:57.280
 It's like, if I still see that I'm getting some insights,

1:14:57.280 --> 1:14:59.000
 I'm not at a dead end yet.

1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:00.680
 But that's also where I learned something

1:15:00.680 --> 1:15:01.920
 from my PhD advisor.

1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:04.280
 Actually, he was a real big inspiration on my life.

1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:05.760
 His name is Benny Sudakov.

1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:08.120
 In fact, he grew up in the former Soviet Union.

1:15:08.120 --> 1:15:12.280
 He was from Georgia, but he's an incredible person.

1:15:12.280 --> 1:15:16.680
 But one thing I learned was choose the problems to work on

1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:21.040
 that might matter if you succeed.

1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:23.400
 Because that's why, for example, we dug into COVID.

1:15:23.400 --> 1:15:25.800
 It was just, well, suppose we succeed

1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:27.840
 in finding some interesting insight here.

1:15:27.840 --> 1:15:29.120
 Well, it actually matters.

1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:30.960
 That is worth a laugh.

1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:35.960
 Yeah, and I think COVID, the way you're approaching COVID

1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:38.200
 has two interesting possibilities.

1:15:38.200 --> 1:15:41.680
 One, it might help with COVID or another pandemic,

1:15:41.680 --> 1:15:46.680
 but two, I mean, just this whole network theory space,

1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:51.200
 you might unlock some deep understanding

1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:53.080
 about the interaction with human beings.

1:15:53.080 --> 1:15:55.880
 That might have nothing to do with the pandemic.

1:15:55.880 --> 1:15:58.360
 There's a space of possible impacts

1:15:58.360 --> 1:16:00.440
 that may be direct or indirect.

1:16:00.440 --> 1:16:03.280
 And the same thing is with Andrew Wiles's proof.

1:16:03.280 --> 1:16:08.120
 I don't understand, but apparently the pieces of it

1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:12.040
 are really impactful for mathematics,

1:16:12.040 --> 1:16:14.880
 even if the main theorem is not.

1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:18.240
 So along the way, the insights you have

1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:22.920
 might be really powerful for unexpected reasons.

1:16:22.920 --> 1:16:23.760
 So I like what you said.

1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:26.840
 This is something that I learned from another friend of mine.

1:16:26.840 --> 1:16:28.080
 He's a very famous researcher.

1:16:28.080 --> 1:16:29.960
 All these people are more famous than I am.

1:16:29.960 --> 1:16:30.960
 His name is Jacob Fox.

1:16:30.960 --> 1:16:32.200
 He's Jacob Fox at Stanford.

1:16:32.200 --> 1:16:33.800
 Also a very big inspiration for me.

1:16:33.800 --> 1:16:36.000
 We were both grad students together at the same time.

1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:36.840
 Well, most importantly,

1:16:36.840 --> 1:16:38.320
 you're good at selecting good friends.

1:16:38.320 --> 1:16:40.000
 Ah, yeah, well, that's the key.

1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:42.040
 You gotta find good people to learn things from.

1:16:42.040 --> 1:16:44.400
 But his thing was, he often said,

1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:46.840
 if you solve a math problem and have this math proof,

1:16:46.840 --> 1:16:48.920
 math problem for him is like a proof, right?

1:16:48.920 --> 1:16:50.440
 So suppose you came up with this proof.

1:16:50.440 --> 1:16:53.440
 He always asks, what have we learned from this

1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:56.040
 that we could potentially use for something else?

1:16:56.040 --> 1:16:58.080
 It's not just, did you solve the problem

1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:00.080
 that was supposed to be famous?

1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:03.360
 And is there something new in the course of solving this

1:17:03.360 --> 1:17:04.600
 that you had to invent

1:17:04.600 --> 1:17:06.720
 that we could now use as a tool elsewhere?

1:17:06.720 --> 1:17:08.880
 Yeah, there's this funny effect

1:17:08.880 --> 1:17:12.680
 where just looking at different fields

1:17:12.680 --> 1:17:15.040
 where people discover parallels.

1:17:15.040 --> 1:17:17.520
 They'll prove something, it'll be a totally new result.

1:17:17.520 --> 1:17:19.040
 And then somebody later realizes

1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:20.680
 this was already done 30 years ago

1:17:20.680 --> 1:17:23.400
 in another discipline, in another way.

1:17:23.400 --> 1:17:25.080
 And it's really interesting.

1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:27.800
 Now, we did this offline

1:17:27.800 --> 1:17:30.240
 in another illustration he showed to me.

1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:33.920
 It's interesting to see the different perspectives

1:17:33.920 --> 1:17:35.560
 on a problem.

1:17:35.560 --> 1:17:38.760
 It kind of points like there's just like

1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:42.320
 very few novel ideas that everything else,

1:17:42.320 --> 1:17:45.480
 that most of us are just looking at different perspective

1:17:45.480 --> 1:17:47.200
 on the same idea.

1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:51.520
 And it makes you wonder this old silly question

1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:53.840
 that I have to ask you is,

1:17:53.840 --> 1:17:58.200
 do you think mathematics is discovered or invented?

1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:02.560
 Do you think we're creating new idea?

1:18:02.560 --> 1:18:06.160
 Are we building a set of knowledge

1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:09.200
 that's distinct from reality?

1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:12.000
 Or are we actually like,

1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:13.480
 is math almost like a shovel

1:18:13.480 --> 1:18:16.880
 where we're digging to like this core set of truths

1:18:16.880 --> 1:18:20.000
 that were always there all along?

1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:22.800
 So I personally feel like it's discovered.

1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:25.360
 But that's also because I guess the way that

1:18:25.360 --> 1:18:27.400
 I like to choose what questions to work on

1:18:27.400 --> 1:18:31.120
 are questions that maybe we'll get to learn something about

1:18:31.120 --> 1:18:32.200
 why is this hard?

1:18:32.200 --> 1:18:33.880
 I mean, I'm often attracted to questions

1:18:33.880 --> 1:18:36.880
 that look simple, but are hard, right?

1:18:36.880 --> 1:18:38.680
 And what could you possibly learn from that?

1:18:38.680 --> 1:18:40.280
 Sort of like probably the attraction

1:18:40.280 --> 1:18:42.680
 of Fermat's last theorem, as you mentioned,

1:18:42.680 --> 1:18:44.960
 simple statement, why is it so hard?

1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:47.520
 So I'm more on the discovered side.

1:18:47.520 --> 1:18:49.600
 And I also feel like if we ever ran into

1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:53.120
 an intelligent other species in the universe,

1:18:54.800 --> 1:18:56.960
 probably if we compared notes,

1:18:56.960 --> 1:19:00.120
 there might be some similarities between both of us

1:19:00.120 --> 1:19:02.280
 realizing that pi is important.

1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:04.480
 Because you might say, why, why humans,

1:19:04.480 --> 1:19:06.080
 do humans like circles more than others?

1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:08.120
 I think stars also like circles.

1:19:08.120 --> 1:19:09.880
 I think planets like circles.

1:19:09.880 --> 1:19:10.920
 They're not perfect circles,

1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:13.160
 but nevertheless, the concept of a circle

1:19:13.160 --> 1:19:15.760
 is just point and constant distance.

1:19:15.760 --> 1:19:17.400
 Doesn't get any simpler than that.

1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:19.960
 It's possible that like an alien species

1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:23.280
 will have, depending on different cognitive capabilities

1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:25.000
 and different perception systems,

1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:28.200
 will be able to see things

1:19:28.200 --> 1:19:30.400
 that are much different than circles.

1:19:30.400 --> 1:19:33.640
 And so if it's discovered,

1:19:33.640 --> 1:19:35.840
 it will still be pointing at a lot of same

1:19:35.840 --> 1:19:38.560
 geometrical concepts, mathematical concepts,

1:19:38.560 --> 1:19:43.520
 but it's interesting to think of how many things

1:19:43.520 --> 1:19:45.720
 we would have to still align,

1:19:45.720 --> 1:19:48.520
 not just based on notation, but based on understanding,

1:19:48.520 --> 1:19:53.520
 like just like some basic mathematical concepts,

1:19:53.960 --> 1:19:56.880
 like how much work is there going to be

1:19:56.880 --> 1:19:59.240
 in trying to find a common language?

1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:02.480
 I mean, this is, I think Stephen Wolfram and his son

1:20:02.480 --> 1:20:04.600
 helped with the movie Arrival,

1:20:04.600 --> 1:20:07.240
 like the developing an alien language,

1:20:07.240 --> 1:20:09.480
 like how would aliens communicate with humans?

1:20:10.640 --> 1:20:11.800
 It's fascinating,

1:20:11.800 --> 1:20:14.360
 because like math seems to be the most promising thing,

1:20:14.360 --> 1:20:15.920
 but even like math,

1:20:15.920 --> 1:20:20.920
 like how do you visualize mathematical ideas?

1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:24.640
 It feels like there has to be an interactive component,

1:20:24.640 --> 1:20:26.560
 just like we have a conversation.

1:20:26.560 --> 1:20:28.440
 There has to be, this is something we don't,

1:20:28.440 --> 1:20:31.440
 I think, think about often, which is like,

1:20:31.440 --> 1:20:33.880
 with somebody who doesn't know anything about math,

1:20:33.880 --> 1:20:35.480
 doesn't know anything about English

1:20:35.480 --> 1:20:37.440
 or any other natural language,

1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:40.120
 how would we describe,

1:20:40.120 --> 1:20:42.400
 we talked offline about visual proofs.

1:20:42.400 --> 1:20:47.400
 How would we, through visual proofs, have a conversation

1:20:47.400 --> 1:20:50.160
 where we say something, here's the concept,

1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:53.800
 the way we see it, does that make sense to you?

1:20:53.800 --> 1:20:57.360
 And like, can you mess with that concept

1:20:57.360 --> 1:20:58.760
 to make it sense for you?

1:20:58.760 --> 1:21:01.400
 And then go back and forth in this kind of way.

1:21:01.400 --> 1:21:03.040
 So purely through mathematics,

1:21:03.040 --> 1:21:04.960
 I'm sure it's possible to have those kinds of experiments

1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:07.040
 with like tribes on earth that don't,

1:21:07.040 --> 1:21:08.400
 there's no common language.

1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:10.840
 Through math, like draw a circle

1:21:10.840 --> 1:21:13.200
 and see what they do with it, right?

1:21:13.200 --> 1:21:15.640
 Do some of these visual proofs,

1:21:15.640 --> 1:21:19.720
 like the summation of the odds and adds up to the squares.

1:21:19.720 --> 1:21:21.960
 Yes, I wonder how difficult that is

1:21:21.960 --> 1:21:24.760
 before one or the other species murders themselves.

1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:27.720
 That's a good question.

1:21:27.720 --> 1:21:29.760
 I hope that the curiosity for knowledge

1:21:29.760 --> 1:21:31.480
 will overpower the greedy,

1:21:31.480 --> 1:21:33.520
 this is back to our game theory thing,

1:21:33.520 --> 1:21:37.280
 that the curiosity of like discovering math together

1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:40.040
 will overpower the desire for resources

1:21:40.040 --> 1:21:44.440
 and ultimately like willing to commit violence

1:21:44.440 --> 1:21:46.440
 in order to gain those resources.

1:21:46.440 --> 1:21:47.920
 I think as we progress,

1:21:47.920 --> 1:21:50.080
 become more and more intelligent as a species,

1:21:50.080 --> 1:21:53.320
 I'm hoping we would value more and more of the knowledge

1:21:53.320 --> 1:21:54.880
 because we'll come up with clever ways

1:21:54.880 --> 1:21:58.160
 to gain more resources so we won't be so resource starved.

1:21:58.160 --> 1:21:59.000
 I don't know.

1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:01.240
 That's a hopeful message for when we finally meet aliens.

1:22:01.240 --> 1:22:02.600
 Yeah, yeah.

1:22:02.600 --> 1:22:05.720
 The cool thing about the Math Olympiad,

1:22:07.120 --> 1:22:11.400
 I don't know if you know work from Francois Chollet

1:22:11.400 --> 1:22:16.400
 from Google, he came up with this kind of IQ test slash,

1:22:16.400 --> 1:22:18.880
 it kind of has similar aspects to it

1:22:18.880 --> 1:22:23.880
 that also the Math Olympiad does for AI.

1:22:24.320 --> 1:22:25.920
 So he came up with these tests

1:22:25.920 --> 1:22:29.040
 where they're very simple for humans,

1:22:29.040 --> 1:22:32.280
 but very difficult for AI to illustrate exactly

1:22:32.280 --> 1:22:37.280
 why we're just not good at seeing a totally new problem.

1:22:38.960 --> 1:22:43.960
 Sorry, AI systems are not good at looking at a new problem

1:22:43.960 --> 1:22:46.680
 that requires you to detect

1:22:46.680 --> 1:22:48.560
 that there's a symmetry of some kind,

1:22:48.560 --> 1:22:53.560
 or there's a pattern that hasn't seen before.

1:22:53.880 --> 1:22:56.680
 The pattern is like obvious to us humans,

1:22:56.680 --> 1:22:59.480
 but it's not so obvious to find that kind of,

1:22:59.480 --> 1:23:02.240
 you're inventing a pattern that's there

1:23:03.640 --> 1:23:06.360
 in order to then find a solution.

1:23:09.720 --> 1:23:12.720
 I don't know if you can comment on that.

1:23:12.720 --> 1:23:16.280
 If you can comment on, but from an AI perspective

1:23:16.280 --> 1:23:19.440
 and from a math problem perspective,

1:23:19.440 --> 1:23:22.120
 what do you think is intelligence?

1:23:22.120 --> 1:23:23.640
 What do you think is the thing

1:23:23.640 --> 1:23:25.760
 that allows us to solve that problem?

1:23:25.760 --> 1:23:29.560
 And how hard is it to build a machine to do that?

1:23:29.560 --> 1:23:30.560
 Asking for a friend.

1:23:30.560 --> 1:23:31.400
 Yeah.

1:23:31.400 --> 1:23:33.000
 So I guess, you see,

1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:35.920
 because if I just think of the raw search space, it's huge.

1:23:35.920 --> 1:23:37.000
 That's why you can't do it.

1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:38.640
 And if I think about what makes somebody

1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:42.320
 good at doing these things, they have this heuristic sense.

1:23:42.320 --> 1:23:44.320
 It's almost like a good chess player of saying,

1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:45.960
 let's not keep analyzing down this way

1:23:45.960 --> 1:23:47.600
 because there's some heuristic reason

1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:49.240
 why that's a bad way to go.

1:23:49.240 --> 1:23:50.520
 Where did they get that heuristic from?

1:23:50.520 --> 1:23:51.760
 Now, that's a good question.

1:23:51.760 --> 1:23:53.000
 I don't know.

1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:56.680
 Because that, if you asked them to explain to you,

1:23:56.680 --> 1:23:58.200
 they could probably say something in words

1:23:58.200 --> 1:23:59.640
 that sounds like it makes sense,

1:23:59.640 --> 1:24:01.240
 but I'm guessing that's only a part

1:24:01.240 --> 1:24:03.000
 of what's really going on in their brain

1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:04.800
 of evaluating that position.

1:24:04.800 --> 1:24:05.640
 You know what I mean?

1:24:05.640 --> 1:24:06.800
 If you ask Gary Kasparov, what is good,

1:24:06.800 --> 1:24:10.240
 or why is this position good, he will say something,

1:24:10.240 --> 1:24:12.520
 but probably not approximating everything

1:24:12.520 --> 1:24:14.000
 that's going on inside.

1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:16.920
 So there's basically a function being computed,

1:24:16.920 --> 1:24:19.200
 but it's hard to articulate what that function is.

1:24:19.200 --> 1:24:21.760
 Now, the question is, could a computer get as good

1:24:21.760 --> 1:24:24.200
 at computing these kinds of heuristic functions?

1:24:24.200 --> 1:24:25.040
 Maybe.

1:24:25.040 --> 1:24:27.840
 I'm not enough of an expert to understand,

1:24:27.840 --> 1:24:30.320
 but one bit of me has always been a little bit curious

1:24:30.320 --> 1:24:34.200
 of whether or not the human brain has a particular tendency

1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:37.480
 due to its wiring to come up with certain kinds of things,

1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:39.520
 which is just natural due to the way

1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:43.520
 that the topology of the neurons and whatever is there,

1:24:43.520 --> 1:24:46.120
 for which if you tried to just build from scratch

1:24:46.120 --> 1:24:47.280
 a computer to do it,

1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:49.640
 would it naturally have different tendencies?

1:24:49.640 --> 1:24:50.480
 I don't know.

1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:52.280
 This is just me being completely ignorant

1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:53.640
 and just saying a few ideas.

1:24:53.640 --> 1:24:56.160
 Well, this is a good thing that mathematics shows

1:24:56.160 --> 1:24:57.840
 is we don't have to be,

1:24:57.840 --> 1:25:00.920
 so math and physics or mathematical physics

1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:02.440
 operates in a world that's different

1:25:02.440 --> 1:25:07.440
 than our descendants of eight brains operate in.

1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:11.880
 So it allows us to have multiple, many, many dimensions.

1:25:11.880 --> 1:25:15.440
 It allows us to work on weird surfaces.

1:25:15.440 --> 1:25:19.920
 I would like topology as a discipline is just weird to me.

1:25:19.920 --> 1:25:21.120
 It's really complicated,

1:25:21.120 --> 1:25:23.560
 but it allows us to work in that space,

1:25:23.560 --> 1:25:25.840
 the differential geometry and all those kinds of things

1:25:25.840 --> 1:25:30.560
 where it's totally outside of our natural day to day

1:25:30.560 --> 1:25:33.240
 four dimensional experience,

1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:35.320
 3D dimensional with time experience.

1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:40.320
 So math gives me hope that we can discover

1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:49.200
 the processes of intelligence outside the limited nature

1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:51.960
 of our own human experiences.

1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:54.960
 But you said that you're not an expert.

1:25:55.920 --> 1:25:57.200
 It's kind of funny.

1:25:57.200 --> 1:26:02.200
 I find that we know so little about intelligence

1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:07.200
 that I honestly think like almost children are more expert

1:26:08.760 --> 1:26:13.760
 at creating artificial intelligence systems than adults.

1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:15.760
 I feel like we know so little,

1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:18.200
 we really need to think outside the box.

1:26:18.200 --> 1:26:19.840
 And those little,

1:26:19.840 --> 1:26:22.120
 I found people should check out

1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:24.640
 Francois Chollet's little exams,

1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:27.080
 but even just solving math problems,

1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:30.560
 I don't know if you've ever done this for yourself,

1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:33.400
 but when you solve a math problem,

1:26:33.400 --> 1:26:38.160
 you kind of then trace back and try to figure out

1:26:38.160 --> 1:26:40.440
 where did that idea come from?

1:26:40.440 --> 1:26:45.240
 Like what was I visualizing in my head?

1:26:45.240 --> 1:26:47.320
 How did I start visualizing it that way?

1:26:48.640 --> 1:26:52.280
 Why did I start rotating that cube in my head in that way?

1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:53.120
 Like what is that?

1:26:53.120 --> 1:26:55.480
 If I were to try to build a program that does that,

1:26:55.480 --> 1:26:56.880
 where did that come from?

1:26:56.880 --> 1:26:58.960
 So this is interesting.

1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:02.680
 So I try to do this to teach middle school students

1:27:02.680 --> 1:27:05.560
 how to learn how to create and think and invent.

1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:06.840
 And the way I do it

1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:08.920
 is there are these math competition problems

1:27:08.920 --> 1:27:10.560
 and I'm working in collaboration

1:27:10.560 --> 1:27:12.000
 with the people who run those.

1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:14.040
 And I will turn on my YouTube live

1:27:14.040 --> 1:27:15.080
 and for the first time,

1:27:15.080 --> 1:27:17.440
 look at those questions and live solve them.

1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:21.160
 The reason I do this is to let the middle school students

1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:22.400
 and the high school students and the adults

1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:23.440
 whoever wants to watch,

1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:27.360
 just see what exactly goes on through someone's head

1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:30.400
 as they go and attempt to invent what they need to do

1:27:30.400 --> 1:27:32.080
 to solve the question.

1:27:32.080 --> 1:27:34.520
 So I've actually thought about that.

1:27:34.520 --> 1:27:37.600
 I think that, first of all, as a teacher,

1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:39.920
 I think about that because whenever I want to explain

1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:42.000
 to a student how to do something,

1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:44.080
 I want to explain how it made sense,

1:27:44.080 --> 1:27:46.160
 why it's intuitive to do the following things

1:27:46.160 --> 1:27:48.720
 and why the wrong things are wrong.

1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:51.840
 Not just why this one short fast way,

1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:54.600
 well, why this is the right way, if that makes sense.

1:27:54.600 --> 1:27:57.200
 So my point is I'm actually always thinking about that.

1:27:57.200 --> 1:27:58.880
 Like how would you think about these things?

1:27:58.880 --> 1:28:00.560
 And then I eventually decided the easiest way

1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:04.440
 to expose this would just be to go live on YouTube

1:28:04.440 --> 1:28:06.560
 and just say, I've never seen any of these questions before.

1:28:06.560 --> 1:28:07.760
 Here we go.

1:28:07.760 --> 1:28:12.680
 Don't you get, that's anxiety inducing for me.

1:28:12.680 --> 1:28:17.240
 Don't you get trapped in a kind of like little dead ends

1:28:17.240 --> 1:28:20.320
 of confusion, even on middle school problems?

1:28:20.320 --> 1:28:21.960
 Yes, that's what the comments are for.

1:28:21.960 --> 1:28:24.600
 The live comments come in and students say, try this.

1:28:24.600 --> 1:28:25.600
 Oh wow.

1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:26.640
 It's actually pretty good.

1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:27.760
 And I'll never get stuck.

1:28:27.760 --> 1:28:30.400
 I mean, I'm willing to go on camera and say,

1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:32.160
 guess what, Potion Dough can't do this.

1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:33.120
 That's fine.

1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:35.760
 But then what ends up happening is you will then see

1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:38.080
 how maybe somebody saying something and I look at the chat

1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:40.600
 and I say, aha, that actually looks useful.

1:28:40.600 --> 1:28:44.000
 Now that also shows how not all ideas,

1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.880
 not all suggestions are the same power, if that makes sense.

1:28:46.880 --> 1:28:48.120
 Because if I actually do get stuck,

1:28:48.120 --> 1:28:52.000
 I'll go fishing through the chat, if you've got any ideas.

1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:53.280
 I don't know if you can speak to this,

1:28:53.280 --> 1:28:57.320
 but is there a moment for the middle school students,

1:28:57.320 --> 1:28:59.640
 maybe high school as well,

1:28:59.640 --> 1:29:04.360
 where there's like a turning point for them

1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:07.800
 where they maybe fall in love with mathematics

1:29:07.800 --> 1:29:09.720
 or they get it?

1:29:09.720 --> 1:29:13.360
 Is there something to be said about like discovering

1:29:13.360 --> 1:29:17.640
 that moment and trying to grab them to get them

1:29:17.640 --> 1:29:20.200
 to understand that mathematics is something,

1:29:20.200 --> 1:29:21.520
 no matter what they wanna do in life

1:29:21.520 --> 1:29:23.040
 could be part of their life?

1:29:23.040 --> 1:29:23.880
 Yes.

1:29:23.880 --> 1:29:25.440
 I actually do think that the middle school

1:29:25.440 --> 1:29:26.800
 is exactly the right time

1:29:26.800 --> 1:29:27.880
 because that's the place

1:29:27.880 --> 1:29:30.400
 where your mathematical understanding

1:29:30.400 --> 1:29:32.440
 gets just sophisticated enough

1:29:32.440 --> 1:29:34.640
 that you can start doing interesting things.

1:29:34.640 --> 1:29:37.600
 Because if you're early on and counting,

1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:40.720
 I'm honestly not very good at teaching you new insights.

1:29:40.720 --> 1:29:41.880
 My wife is pretty good at that.

1:29:41.880 --> 1:29:44.120
 But somehow once you get to this part

1:29:44.120 --> 1:29:45.680
 where you know what a fraction is

1:29:45.680 --> 1:29:49.560
 and when you know how to add and how to multiply

1:29:49.560 --> 1:29:51.200
 and what the area of a triangle is,

1:29:51.200 --> 1:29:54.120
 at that point to me, the whole world opens up

1:29:54.120 --> 1:29:55.240
 and you can start observing

1:29:55.240 --> 1:29:57.360
 there are really nifty coincidences,

1:29:57.360 --> 1:29:59.840
 the things that made the Greek mathematicians

1:29:59.840 --> 1:30:02.120
 and the ancient mathematicians excited.

1:30:02.120 --> 1:30:03.880
 Actually back then it was exciting

1:30:03.880 --> 1:30:05.680
 to discover the Pythagorean theorem.

1:30:05.680 --> 1:30:06.880
 It wasn't just homework.

1:30:07.840 --> 1:30:08.680
 So is there,

1:30:10.280 --> 1:30:11.760
 which discipline do you think

1:30:11.760 --> 1:30:14.080
 has the most exciting coincidences?

1:30:14.080 --> 1:30:16.360
 So is it geometry?

1:30:16.360 --> 1:30:17.920
 Is it algebra?

1:30:17.920 --> 1:30:21.560
 Or is it calculus?

1:30:21.560 --> 1:30:22.680
 Well, you see, you're asking me

1:30:22.680 --> 1:30:24.520
 and I'm the guy who gets the most excited

1:30:24.520 --> 1:30:27.320
 when the combinatorics shows up in the geometry.

1:30:27.320 --> 1:30:30.040
 Is it, okay.

1:30:30.040 --> 1:30:33.080
 So it's the combinatorics in the geometry.

1:30:33.080 --> 1:30:35.240
 So first of all, the nice thing about geometry,

1:30:35.240 --> 1:30:37.920
 this is the same nice thing about computer vision

1:30:37.920 --> 1:30:39.160
 is it's visual.

1:30:40.040 --> 1:30:42.720
 So geometry, you can draw circles and triangles and stuff.

1:30:42.720 --> 1:30:46.720
 So it naturally presents itself

1:30:46.720 --> 1:30:49.280
 to the visual proof, right?

1:30:49.280 --> 1:30:51.160
 But also the nice thing about geometry,

1:30:51.160 --> 1:30:56.160
 I think for me is the earliest class,

1:30:56.360 --> 1:30:59.680
 the earliest discipline where there's,

1:30:59.680 --> 1:31:02.600
 that's most amenable to the exploration,

1:31:02.600 --> 1:31:04.960
 the invention through proofs.

1:31:04.960 --> 1:31:09.640
 The idea of proofs I think is most easily shown in geometry

1:31:09.640 --> 1:31:11.240
 because it's so visual, I guess.

1:31:12.280 --> 1:31:14.400
 So that to me is like,

1:31:14.400 --> 1:31:15.440
 if I were to think about

1:31:15.440 --> 1:31:18.360
 when I first fell in love with math, it would be geometry.

1:31:18.360 --> 1:31:21.280
 And sadly enough, that's not used.

1:31:21.280 --> 1:31:23.240
 Geometry only has a little,

1:31:23.240 --> 1:31:28.240
 appears briefly in the journey of a student.

1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:30.600
 And it kind of disappears.

1:31:30.600 --> 1:31:32.320
 And not until much later,

1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:36.560
 which there may be like differential geometry,

1:31:36.560 --> 1:31:37.720
 I don't know where else it shows up.

1:31:37.720 --> 1:31:38.840
 For me in computer science,

1:31:38.840 --> 1:31:40.960
 like you could start to think about

1:31:40.960 --> 1:31:44.520
 like computational geometry or even graph theory

1:31:44.520 --> 1:31:45.600
 as a kind of geometry.

1:31:45.600 --> 1:31:47.200
 You could start to think about it visually,

1:31:47.200 --> 1:31:49.320
 although it's pretty tricky.

1:31:49.320 --> 1:31:51.080
 But yeah, it was always,

1:31:51.080 --> 1:31:53.000
 that was the most beautiful one.

1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:56.200
 Everything else, I guess calculus can be kind of visual too.

1:31:56.200 --> 1:31:57.800
 That can be pretty beautiful.

1:31:57.800 --> 1:32:02.800
 But is there something you try to look for in the student

1:32:05.360 --> 1:32:09.920
 to see like, how can I inspire them at this moment?

1:32:09.920 --> 1:32:11.960
 Or is this like individual student to student?

1:32:11.960 --> 1:32:13.880
 Is there something you could say there?

1:32:13.880 --> 1:32:14.720
 So first of all,

1:32:14.720 --> 1:32:16.440
 I really think that every student

1:32:16.440 --> 1:32:17.880
 can pick up all of this skill.

1:32:17.880 --> 1:32:18.720
 I really do think so.

1:32:18.720 --> 1:32:20.520
 I don't think it's something only for a few.

1:32:20.520 --> 1:32:23.680
 And so if I'm looking for a student,

1:32:23.680 --> 1:32:25.080
 actually oftentimes what I'm,

1:32:25.080 --> 1:32:26.800
 if I'm looking at a particular student,

1:32:26.800 --> 1:32:28.400
 the question is,

1:32:28.400 --> 1:32:30.560
 how can we help you feel like

1:32:30.560 --> 1:32:32.880
 you have the power to invent also?

1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:34.200
 Because I think a lot of people

1:32:34.200 --> 1:32:35.600
 are used to thinking about math

1:32:35.600 --> 1:32:37.960
 as something where the teacher will show you what to do

1:32:37.960 --> 1:32:39.240
 and then you will do it.

1:32:39.240 --> 1:32:40.080
 Yes.

1:32:40.080 --> 1:32:42.160
 So I think that the key is to show that they have some,

1:32:42.160 --> 1:32:44.280
 let them see that they have some power to invent.

1:32:44.280 --> 1:32:45.120
 And at that point,

1:32:45.120 --> 1:32:47.640
 it's often starting by trying to give a question

1:32:47.640 --> 1:32:48.720
 that they don't know how to do.

1:32:48.720 --> 1:32:49.880
 You want to find these questions

1:32:49.880 --> 1:32:51.160
 that they don't know how to do,

1:32:51.160 --> 1:32:53.000
 that they can think about,

1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:54.480
 and then they can solve.

1:32:54.480 --> 1:32:55.600
 And then suddenly they say,

1:32:55.600 --> 1:32:57.800
 my gosh, I've had a situation,

1:32:57.800 --> 1:33:00.440
 I've had an experience where I didn't know what to do.

1:33:00.440 --> 1:33:02.040
 And after a while, I did.

1:33:03.320 --> 1:33:07.800
 Is there advice you can give on how to learn math

1:33:08.760 --> 1:33:10.720
 for people, whether it's a middle school,

1:33:10.720 --> 1:33:14.520
 whether it's somebody as an adult

1:33:14.520 --> 1:33:18.080
 kind of gave up on math maybe early on?

1:33:19.360 --> 1:33:22.080
 I actually think that these math competition problems,

1:33:22.080 --> 1:33:23.800
 middle school and high school are really good.

1:33:23.800 --> 1:33:25.080
 They're actually very hard.

1:33:25.080 --> 1:33:29.160
 So if you haven't had this kind of experience before

1:33:29.160 --> 1:33:32.960
 and you grab a middle school math competition problem

1:33:32.960 --> 1:33:33.920
 from the state level,

1:33:33.920 --> 1:33:36.320
 which is used to decide who represents the state

1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:39.160
 in the country, in the United States, for example,

1:33:39.160 --> 1:33:40.680
 those are pretty tricky.

1:33:40.680 --> 1:33:43.560
 And even if you are a professional,

1:33:43.560 --> 1:33:45.480
 maybe not doing mathematical things

1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:48.280
 and you're not a middle school student, you'll struggle.

1:33:48.280 --> 1:33:51.080
 So I find that these things really do teach you things

1:33:51.080 --> 1:33:53.080
 by trying to work on these questions.

1:33:53.080 --> 1:33:56.760
 Is there a Googleable term that you could use

1:33:56.760 --> 1:33:59.440
 for the organization, for the state competitions?

1:33:59.440 --> 1:34:00.280
 Ah, yeah.

1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:02.280
 So there are a number of different ones

1:34:02.280 --> 1:34:03.600
 that are quite popular.

1:34:03.600 --> 1:34:07.760
 One of them is called Math Counts, M A T H C O U N T S.

1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:08.880
 And that's a big tournament,

1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:10.480
 which actually has a state level.

1:34:10.480 --> 1:34:12.680
 There's also a mathleague.org,

1:34:12.680 --> 1:34:15.360
 mathleague, L E A G U E dot org,

1:34:15.360 --> 1:34:18.680
 also has this kind of tiered tournament structure.

1:34:18.680 --> 1:34:22.600
 There's also the American math competitions, AMC 8.

1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:25.920
 AMC also has AMC 10, that's for 10th grade and below

1:34:25.920 --> 1:34:27.240
 and AMC 12.

1:34:27.240 --> 1:34:29.240
 These are all run by the Mathematical Association

1:34:29.240 --> 1:34:30.280
 of America.

1:34:30.280 --> 1:34:32.880
 And these are all ways to find old questions.

1:34:32.880 --> 1:34:34.840
 What about the daily challenges that you run?

1:34:34.840 --> 1:34:36.000
 What are those about?

1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:36.840
 We do that too.

1:34:36.840 --> 1:34:39.000
 But I mean, the difference was ours isn't,

1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:39.920
 that one's not free.

1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:42.080
 So I should actually probably be careful.

1:34:42.080 --> 1:34:44.280
 The things that I've just mentioned are also not free.

1:34:44.280 --> 1:34:45.720
 Not all of those things I mentioned just now

1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:46.600
 are free either.

1:34:46.600 --> 1:34:48.760
 Well, people can figure out what is free and what's not,

1:34:48.760 --> 1:34:51.040
 but this is really nice to know what's out there.

1:34:51.040 --> 1:34:53.720
 But can you speak a little bit to the daily challenges?

1:34:53.720 --> 1:34:54.560
 Sure, sure.

1:34:54.560 --> 1:34:56.800
 So that's actually what we did when,

1:34:56.800 --> 1:34:58.480
 I guess I was thinking about,

1:34:58.480 --> 1:35:02.040
 how would I try to develop that skill in people

1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:05.360
 if we had the power to architect the entire system ourselves?

1:35:05.360 --> 1:35:07.440
 So that's called the daily challenge with Po Shan Luo.

1:35:07.440 --> 1:35:09.720
 It's not free because that's actually how I pay

1:35:09.720 --> 1:35:11.240
 for everything else I do.

1:35:11.240 --> 1:35:12.840
 So that was the idea.

1:35:12.840 --> 1:35:16.480
 But the concept was, aha, now let's invent from scratch.

1:35:16.480 --> 1:35:17.960
 So if we're gonna go from scratch

1:35:17.960 --> 1:35:19.720
 and we're gonna use technology,

1:35:19.720 --> 1:35:22.040
 what if we made every single lesson

1:35:23.120 --> 1:35:24.680
 something where first I say,

1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:25.840
 hey, here's an interesting question.

1:35:25.840 --> 1:35:27.080
 Recorded, of course, not live.

1:35:27.080 --> 1:35:27.920
 But it's like, I say,

1:35:27.920 --> 1:35:28.760
 hey, here's an interesting question.

1:35:28.760 --> 1:35:29.880
 Why don't we think about this?

1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:32.000
 But I know you don't know how to do it.

1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:32.960
 So now you think,

1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:35.520
 and a minute later a hint pops on the screen.

1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:36.360
 But you still think.

1:35:36.360 --> 1:35:38.560
 And a minute later a big hint pops on the screen.

1:35:38.560 --> 1:35:39.400
 You still think.

1:35:39.400 --> 1:35:41.280
 And then finally, after the three minutes,

1:35:41.280 --> 1:35:43.520
 hopefully you got some ideas you tried to answer.

1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:45.440
 And then suddenly there's like this

1:35:45.440 --> 1:35:47.720
 pretty extended explanation of,

1:35:47.720 --> 1:35:50.280
 oh yeah, so here's like multiple different ways

1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:51.600
 that you can do the question.

1:35:51.600 --> 1:35:54.640
 And by accident, you also just learned this other concept.

1:35:54.640 --> 1:35:55.480
 That's what we did.

1:35:55.480 --> 1:35:56.320
 So yeah.

1:35:56.320 --> 1:35:58.160
 Is this targeted towards middle school students,

1:35:58.160 --> 1:35:59.480
 high school students?

1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:01.360
 It's targeted towards middle school students

1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:02.400
 with competitions.

1:36:02.400 --> 1:36:04.040
 But there's a lot of high school students

1:36:04.040 --> 1:36:06.400
 who didn't do competitions in middle school

1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:07.840
 where they would also learn how to think.

1:36:07.840 --> 1:36:09.800
 If you can see the whole concept was,

1:36:09.800 --> 1:36:11.720
 can we teach people how to think?

1:36:11.720 --> 1:36:12.760
 How would you do that?

1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:14.440
 You need to give people the chance to,

1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:17.960
 on their own, invent without that kid in the front row

1:36:17.960 --> 1:36:20.320
 answering every question in two seconds.

1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:24.040
 And people can find it, I think, what daily.

1:36:24.040 --> 1:36:26.080
 It's daily.potionlo.com.

1:36:26.080 --> 1:36:27.840
 But if you go to find my website,

1:36:27.840 --> 1:36:29.200
 you'll be able to find it.

1:36:29.200 --> 1:36:30.600
 Beautiful.

1:36:30.600 --> 1:36:32.880
 Can we zoom out a little bit in the,

1:36:32.880 --> 1:36:36.240
 so day to day, week to week, month to month,

1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:41.240
 year to year, what does the lifelong educational process

1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:42.840
 look like, do you think?

1:36:43.880 --> 1:36:46.600
 For yourself, but for me,

1:36:46.600 --> 1:36:50.280
 what would you recommend in the world of mathematics

1:36:50.280 --> 1:36:52.600
 or sort of as opposed to studying for a test,

1:36:52.600 --> 1:36:57.600
 but just like lifelong expanding of knowledge

1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:02.120
 in that skill for invention?

1:37:02.120 --> 1:37:05.040
 I think I often articulate this as,

1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:10.040
 can you always try to do more than you could do in the past?

1:37:10.040 --> 1:37:11.440
 Yeah.

1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:13.640
 But that comes in many ways.

1:37:13.640 --> 1:37:15.280
 And I will say it's great

1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:17.680
 if one wants to build that with mathematics,

1:37:17.680 --> 1:37:20.000
 but it's also great to use that philosophy

1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:21.080
 with all other things.

1:37:21.080 --> 1:37:23.920
 In fact, if I just think of myself, I just think,

1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:26.480
 what do I know now that I didn't know a year ago

1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:28.520
 or a month ago or a week ago?

1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:29.400
 And not just know,

1:37:29.400 --> 1:37:32.040
 but what do I have the capability of doing?

1:37:32.040 --> 1:37:35.040
 And if you just have that attitude, it brings more.

1:37:35.040 --> 1:37:38.280
 See, the thing is, there's also a habit,

1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:43.040
 like it is a skill, like I've been using Anki,

1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:46.640
 it's an app for helps you memorize things.

1:37:46.640 --> 1:37:50.720
 And I've actually, a few months ago,

1:37:50.720 --> 1:37:54.960
 started doing this daily of setting aside time

1:37:54.960 --> 1:37:59.960
 to think about an idea that's outside of my work.

1:37:59.960 --> 1:38:04.680
 Like, let's say, it's all over the place, by the way,

1:38:04.680 --> 1:38:07.160
 but let's say politics, like gun control.

1:38:08.320 --> 1:38:11.800
 Is it good to have a lot of guns or not in society?

1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:15.000
 And just, I've set aside time every day,

1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:17.640
 I do at least 10 minutes, but I try to do 30,

1:38:17.640 --> 1:38:19.000
 where I think about a problem.

1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:20.920
 And I kind of outline it for myself from scratch,

1:38:20.920 --> 1:38:22.200
 from not looking anything up,

1:38:22.200 --> 1:38:24.960
 just thinking about it, using common sense.

1:38:24.960 --> 1:38:29.120
 And I think the practice of that is really important.

1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:32.600
 It's the daily routine of it, it's the discipline of it.

1:38:32.600 --> 1:38:35.880
 It's not just that I figured something out

1:38:35.880 --> 1:38:38.800
 from thinking about gun control,

1:38:38.800 --> 1:38:43.080
 it's more that that muscle is built too,

1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:44.200
 it's that thinking muscle.

1:38:44.200 --> 1:38:49.200
 So I'm kind of interested in, you know, math has,

1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:52.080
 because especially because I've gotten specialized

1:38:52.080 --> 1:38:53.040
 into machine learning,

1:38:53.040 --> 1:38:55.360
 and because I love programming so much,

1:38:55.360 --> 1:38:59.760
 I've lost touch with math a little bit

1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:02.400
 to where I feel quite sad about it,

1:39:02.400 --> 1:39:03.920
 and I want to fix that.

1:39:05.040 --> 1:39:07.520
 Even just not math, like pure knowledge math,

1:39:07.520 --> 1:39:10.200
 but math, like these middle school problems,

1:39:10.200 --> 1:39:11.640
 the challenges, right?

1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:14.680
 Is that something you see a person

1:39:14.680 --> 1:39:16.160
 be able to do every single day,

1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:19.600
 kind of just practice every single day for years?

1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:21.520
 So I can give an answer to that,

1:39:21.520 --> 1:39:23.160
 that gives a practical way you could do it,

1:39:23.160 --> 1:39:24.480
 assuming you have kids.

1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:26.920
 So, no, you can do it yourself.

1:39:26.920 --> 1:39:28.000
 Step one, get kids.

1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:29.560
 No, no, I'm just saying this

1:39:29.560 --> 1:39:31.720
 because I'm just thinking out loud right now,

1:39:31.720 --> 1:39:33.720
 what could I do to suggest?

1:39:33.720 --> 1:39:35.960
 Because what I have noticed is that, for example,

1:39:35.960 --> 1:39:37.760
 if you do have kids who are in elementary school

1:39:37.760 --> 1:39:41.080
 or middle school, if you yourself go and look

1:39:41.080 --> 1:39:43.080
 at those middle school math problems

1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:44.480
 to think about interesting ways

1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:46.160
 that you can teach your elementary school

1:39:46.160 --> 1:39:48.120
 or middle school kid, it works.

1:39:48.120 --> 1:39:48.960
 That's what my wife did.

1:39:48.960 --> 1:39:51.040
 She never did any of those contests before,

1:39:51.040 --> 1:39:53.000
 but now she knows quite a lot about them.

1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:53.920
 And I didn't teach her anything.

1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:55.160
 I don't do that.

1:39:55.160 --> 1:39:57.320
 She just was messing around with them

1:39:57.320 --> 1:39:59.600
 and taught herself all of that stuff.

1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:01.400
 And that had the automatic daily.

1:40:01.400 --> 1:40:03.840
 I'm always thinking, how do you make it practical, right?

1:40:03.840 --> 1:40:04.880
 And the way to make it practical

1:40:04.880 --> 1:40:07.680
 is if the timer on the automatically daily

1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:09.520
 is that you are going to automatically daily

1:40:09.520 --> 1:40:11.240
 do something with your own kid.

1:40:11.240 --> 1:40:13.360
 Now it feeds back.

1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:14.760
 And that includes the whole lesson

1:40:14.760 --> 1:40:16.960
 that if you wanna learn something, you should teach it.

1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:19.160
 Oh, I strongly believe that.

1:40:19.160 --> 1:40:21.760
 I strongly believe that.

1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:23.440
 So I currently don't have kids.

1:40:23.440 --> 1:40:25.600
 So that's, maybe I should just get kids

1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:27.040
 to help me with the math thing.

1:40:27.040 --> 1:40:29.320
 But outside of that,

1:40:29.320 --> 1:40:32.040
 I do want to do great math into daily practice.

1:40:32.040 --> 1:40:35.920
 So I'll definitely check out the daily challenges

1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:39.200
 and see, because what is it?

1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:41.080
 Grant Sanderson, we talked about offline,

1:40:41.080 --> 1:40:42.720
 the three blue and brown.

1:40:42.720 --> 1:40:44.920
 He speaks to this as well,

1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:48.200
 that his videos aren't necessarily,

1:40:48.200 --> 1:40:50.520
 they don't speak to the thing that I'm referring to,

1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:52.640
 which is the daily practice.

1:40:52.640 --> 1:40:56.320
 They're more almost tools of inspiration.

1:40:56.320 --> 1:40:58.520
 They kind of show you the beauty

1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:03.520
 of a particular problem in mathematics,

1:41:03.640 --> 1:41:05.760
 but they're not a daily ritual.

1:41:05.760 --> 1:41:09.560
 And I'm in search of that daily ritual mathematics.

1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:11.280
 It's not trivial to find,

1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:16.880
 but I hope to find that

1:41:16.880 --> 1:41:20.960
 because I think math gives you a perspective on the world

1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:23.120
 that enriches everything else.

1:41:23.960 --> 1:41:25.800
 So I like what you said about the daily also,

1:41:25.800 --> 1:41:27.400
 because that's also one reason

1:41:27.400 --> 1:41:29.960
 why I put my Carnegie Mellon class online.

1:41:29.960 --> 1:41:30.800
 It's not every day.

1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:31.960
 It's every other day.

1:41:31.960 --> 1:41:33.280
 Semester is almost over.

1:41:33.280 --> 1:41:35.840
 But the idea was, I guess my philosophy was,

1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:37.320
 if I'm already doing the class,

1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:38.880
 let's just put it there, right?

1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:40.880
 But I do know that there are people

1:41:40.880 --> 1:41:42.280
 who have been following it,

1:41:42.280 --> 1:41:43.880
 who are not in my class at all,

1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:45.920
 who have just been following it because,

1:41:45.920 --> 1:41:47.560
 yes, it's combinatorics.

1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:49.840
 And the value of that is you could,

1:41:49.840 --> 1:41:51.800
 you don't really need to know calculus to follow it,

1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:52.720
 if that makes sense.

1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:54.600
 So it's actually something that people could follow.

1:41:54.600 --> 1:41:56.000
 So again, and that one's free.

1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.680
 So that one's just there on YouTube.

1:41:58.680 --> 1:42:01.440
 Well, speaking of combinatorics,

1:42:01.440 --> 1:42:03.800
 what is it, what do you find interesting,

1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:07.240
 what do you find beautiful about combinatorics?

1:42:07.240 --> 1:42:11.520
 So combinatorics to me is the study of things

1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:16.520
 where they might be more finite and more discreet.

1:42:17.240 --> 1:42:18.960
 What I mean is like, if I look at a network,

1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:20.680
 actually a lot of times the combinatorics

1:42:20.680 --> 1:42:21.880
 will boil down to something,

1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:23.240
 and the combinatorics I think about

1:42:23.240 --> 1:42:25.960
 might be something related to graphs or networks.

1:42:25.960 --> 1:42:28.840
 And they're very discreet because if you have a node,

1:42:28.840 --> 1:42:32.160
 it's not that you have 0.7 of a node

1:42:32.160 --> 1:42:33.520
 and 0.3 of a node over there.

1:42:33.520 --> 1:42:34.720
 It's that you've got one node,

1:42:34.720 --> 1:42:37.440
 and then you jump one step to go to the next node.

1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:39.880
 So that notion is different from say, calculus,

1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:42.080
 which is very continuous,

1:42:42.080 --> 1:42:44.360
 where you go and say, I have this speed,

1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:46.200
 which is changing over time.

1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:47.800
 And now what's the distance I've traveled?

1:42:47.800 --> 1:42:49.040
 That's the notion of an integral,

1:42:49.040 --> 1:42:50.920
 where you have to think of subdividing time

1:42:50.920 --> 1:42:52.640
 into very, very small pieces.

1:42:52.640 --> 1:42:54.400
 So the kinds of things that you do

1:42:54.400 --> 1:42:59.360
 when you reason about these finite discreet structures

1:42:59.360 --> 1:43:03.280
 often might be iterative, algorithmic, inductive.

1:43:03.280 --> 1:43:06.320
 These are ideas where I go from one step to the next step

1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:08.160
 and so on and make progress.

1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:11.280
 I guess I actually personally like all kinds of math.

1:43:11.280 --> 1:43:13.560
 My area of research just ended up in here

1:43:13.560 --> 1:43:17.160
 because I met a really interesting PhD advisor,

1:43:17.160 --> 1:43:19.000
 potential, that's honestly the reason

1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:20.320
 I went into that direction.

1:43:20.320 --> 1:43:22.040
 I met a really interesting guy.

1:43:22.040 --> 1:43:24.880
 He seemed like he did good stuff, interesting stuff,

1:43:24.880 --> 1:43:26.680
 and he looked like he cared about students.

1:43:26.680 --> 1:43:29.240
 And I said, let me just go and learn whatever you do,

1:43:29.240 --> 1:43:32.240
 even though my prior practice and preparation

1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:34.280
 before my PhD was not combinatorics,

1:43:34.280 --> 1:43:36.920
 but analysis, the continuous stuff.

1:43:36.920 --> 1:43:40.600
 So the annoying thing about combinatorics

1:43:40.600 --> 1:43:45.600
 and discreet stuff is it's often really difficult to solve

1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:50.600
 from a sort of running time complexity perspective.

1:43:53.840 --> 1:43:58.840
 Could you speak to the idea of complexity analysis

1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:03.100
 of problems, do you find it useful, do you find it interesting?

1:44:04.480 --> 1:44:08.240
 Do you find that lens of studying the difficulty

1:44:08.240 --> 1:44:12.600
 of how difficult the computer science problem is

1:44:12.600 --> 1:44:15.200
 a useful lens onto the world?

1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:16.200
 Oh, very much so.

1:44:16.200 --> 1:44:20.400
 Because if you want to make something practical

1:44:20.400 --> 1:44:22.760
 which has large numbers of people using it,

1:44:22.760 --> 1:44:27.240
 the computational complexity to me is almost question one.

1:44:27.240 --> 1:44:29.080
 And that's, again, that's at the origin

1:44:29.080 --> 1:44:31.760
 of when we started doing this stuff with disease control.

1:44:31.760 --> 1:44:33.480
 From the very beginning, the deep questions

1:44:33.480 --> 1:44:35.400
 that were running through my mind were,

1:44:35.400 --> 1:44:38.480
 would we be able to support a large population

1:44:38.480 --> 1:44:39.680
 with only one server?

1:44:41.160 --> 1:44:43.680
 And if the answer is no, we can't start

1:44:43.680 --> 1:44:45.280
 because I don't have enough money.

1:44:48.200 --> 1:44:51.080
 Yeah, and there the question is very much

1:44:51.080 --> 1:44:56.080
 linear time versus anything slower than linear time.

1:44:58.360 --> 1:45:00.280
 As a very specific thing, you have a bunch

1:45:00.280 --> 1:45:01.360
 of really interesting papers.

1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:04.240
 If I could ask, maybe we could pull out some cool insights

1:45:04.240 --> 1:45:05.240
 at the high level.

1:45:06.160 --> 1:45:08.920
 Can you describe the data structure of a voting tree

1:45:08.920 --> 1:45:11.240
 and what are some interesting results on it?

1:45:11.240 --> 1:45:13.720
 You have a paper that I noticed on it.

1:45:13.720 --> 1:45:17.400
 Yeah, so this is an example of, I guess,

1:45:17.400 --> 1:45:20.960
 how in math we might say here's an interesting

1:45:20.960 --> 1:45:24.400
 kind of a question that we just can't seem

1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:25.720
 to understand enough about.

1:45:25.720 --> 1:45:27.560
 Maybe there's something else going on here.

1:45:27.560 --> 1:45:30.920
 And the way to describe this is you could imagine

1:45:30.920 --> 1:45:33.800
 trying to hold elections where if you have

1:45:33.800 --> 1:45:35.920
 only two candidates, that's kind of easy.

1:45:35.920 --> 1:45:37.200
 You just run them against each other

1:45:37.200 --> 1:45:38.600
 and see who gets more votes.

1:45:38.600 --> 1:45:40.680
 But as you know, once you have more candidates,

1:45:40.680 --> 1:45:43.120
 it's very difficult to decide who wins the election.

1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:46.280
 And there's an entire voting theory around this.

1:45:46.280 --> 1:45:49.400
 So a theoretical question became,

1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:53.560
 what if you made like a system of runoffs,

1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:57.160
 like a system of head to head contests,

1:45:57.160 --> 1:45:58.600
 which is structured like a tree,

1:45:58.600 --> 1:46:00.200
 almost looking like a circuit.

1:46:00.200 --> 1:46:03.160
 I'm using that way of thinking because it's sort of like

1:46:03.160 --> 1:46:05.680
 in electrical engineering or computer science,

1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:08.120
 you might imagine having a bunch of leads

1:46:08.120 --> 1:46:10.520
 that carry signal, which are going through AND gates

1:46:10.520 --> 1:46:11.640
 and OR gates and whatnot.

1:46:11.640 --> 1:46:13.640
 And you've managed to compute beautiful things.

1:46:13.640 --> 1:46:16.280
 This is just from a purely abstract point of view.

1:46:16.280 --> 1:46:18.600
 What if the inputs are candidates?

1:46:18.600 --> 1:46:20.840
 And for every two candidates, it is known

1:46:20.840 --> 1:46:23.480
 which of the candidates is more popular than the other.

1:46:23.480 --> 1:46:25.880
 Now can you build some kind of a circuit board

1:46:25.880 --> 1:46:28.000
 which says, first candidate number four

1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:31.600
 will play against five and see who wins and so on.

1:46:31.600 --> 1:46:34.600
 Okay, so now what would be a nice outcome, right?

1:46:34.600 --> 1:46:35.840
 This is a general question of,

1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:39.120
 could I make a big circuit board to feed an election into?

1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:41.320
 Like maybe one nice outcome would be whoever wins

1:46:41.320 --> 1:46:44.680
 at least is preferred over a lot of people.

1:46:44.680 --> 1:46:45.520
 Yes.

1:46:45.520 --> 1:46:48.480
 So for example, if you ran in 1,024 candidates,

1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:51.080
 ideally we would like a guarantee that says

1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:54.080
 that the winner beats a lot of people.

1:46:54.080 --> 1:46:58.520
 Actually in any system where there are 1,024 candidates,

1:46:58.520 --> 1:47:00.320
 there's always a candidate who beats

1:47:00.320 --> 1:47:02.840
 at least 512 of the others.

1:47:02.840 --> 1:47:04.360
 This is a mathematical fact

1:47:04.360 --> 1:47:06.200
 that there's actually always a person who beats

1:47:06.200 --> 1:47:09.680
 at least half of the other people.

1:47:09.680 --> 1:47:13.400
 I'm trying to make sense of that mathematical fact.

1:47:13.400 --> 1:47:15.000
 Is this supposed to be obvious?

1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:17.000
 No, but I can explain it.

1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:17.840
 No, I can't.

1:47:17.840 --> 1:47:21.400
 The way it works is that, think of it this way.

1:47:21.400 --> 1:47:24.280
 Every time I think, imagine I have all these candidates

1:47:24.280 --> 1:47:26.040
 and everyone is competing,

1:47:26.040 --> 1:47:29.200
 everyone is like compared with everyone else at some point.

1:47:29.200 --> 1:47:30.600
 Well, think of it this way.

1:47:30.600 --> 1:47:34.200
 Whenever there's a comparison, somebody gets a point.

1:47:34.200 --> 1:47:37.000
 That's the one who is better than the other one.

1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:39.440
 My claim is there's somebody whose score

1:47:39.440 --> 1:47:42.880
 is at least half of how many other people there are.

1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:44.840
 Yeah, I'm just trying to,

1:47:44.840 --> 1:47:47.600
 like my intuition is very close to that being true,

1:47:47.600 --> 1:47:48.680
 but it's beautiful.

1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:52.240
 I didn't at first, that's not an obvious fact.

1:47:52.240 --> 1:47:53.080
 No, it's not.

1:47:53.080 --> 1:47:55.760
 And it feels like a beautiful fact.

1:47:55.760 --> 1:47:57.120
 Well, let me explain it this way.

1:47:57.120 --> 1:48:00.520
 Imagine that for every match,

1:48:00.520 --> 1:48:03.840
 you didn't give one point, but you gave two points.

1:48:03.840 --> 1:48:05.920
 You gave one point to each person.

1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:07.040
 Now that's not what we're really doing.

1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:10.840
 We really want to give one point to the winner of the match,

1:48:10.840 --> 1:48:12.240
 but instead we'll just give two.

1:48:12.240 --> 1:48:15.880
 If you gave two points to everyone on every matchup,

1:48:15.880 --> 1:48:18.400
 actually everyone has the same number of points.

1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:19.680
 And the number of points they get

1:48:19.680 --> 1:48:21.440
 is how many other people there are.

1:48:22.520 --> 1:48:23.560
 Does that sort of make sense?

1:48:23.560 --> 1:48:24.400
 I'm just like saying.

1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:26.640
 No, no, everything you're saying makes perfect sense.

1:48:26.640 --> 1:48:30.720
 So the point is if for every comparison between two people,

1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:32.480
 which I'm doing for every two people,

1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:34.400
 I gave one point to each person,

1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:36.640
 your score, everyone's score is the same.

1:48:36.640 --> 1:48:38.560
 It's how many other people there are.

1:48:38.560 --> 1:48:40.200
 Now we only make one change.

1:48:40.200 --> 1:48:44.320
 For each matchup, you give one point only to the winner.

1:48:44.320 --> 1:48:46.000
 So we're awarding half the points.

1:48:47.040 --> 1:48:50.240
 So now the deal is if in the original situation,

1:48:50.240 --> 1:48:52.120
 everyone's score was equal,

1:48:52.120 --> 1:48:54.840
 which is how many other people there are.

1:48:54.840 --> 1:48:58.480
 Now there's only half the number of points to go around.

1:48:58.480 --> 1:49:01.000
 So what ends up happening is that

1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:02.360
 there's always going to be,

1:49:02.360 --> 1:49:04.680
 like the average number of points per person

1:49:04.680 --> 1:49:07.120
 is going to be half of how many other people there are.

1:49:07.120 --> 1:49:08.560
 And somebody is gonna be above average.

1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:09.880
 Somebody is going to be above that.

1:49:09.880 --> 1:49:10.720
 At least average.

1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:13.200
 Yeah, this is this notion of expected value,

1:49:13.200 --> 1:49:14.520
 that if I have a random variable,

1:49:14.520 --> 1:49:16.200
 which has an expected value,

1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:17.800
 there's going to be some possibility

1:49:17.800 --> 1:49:19.280
 in the probability space

1:49:19.280 --> 1:49:21.560
 where you're at least as big as the expected value.

1:49:21.560 --> 1:49:23.680
 Yeah, when you describe it like that, it's obvious.

1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:26.640
 But when you're first saying in this little circuit

1:49:26.640 --> 1:49:31.040
 that there's going to be one candidate better than half,

1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:33.360
 that's not obvious.

1:49:33.360 --> 1:49:34.200
 Yeah, it's not obvious.

1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:35.040
 It's funny.

1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:35.880
 It's not obvious.

1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:37.160
 Math, this is nice.

1:49:37.160 --> 1:49:38.600
 Okay, so you have this,

1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:42.800
 but ultimately you're trying to with a voting tree,

1:49:42.800 --> 1:49:43.880
 I don't know if you're trying this,

1:49:43.880 --> 1:49:48.360
 but to have a circuit that's like, that's small.

1:49:48.360 --> 1:49:49.200
 Well, you'd like it to be small.

1:49:49.200 --> 1:49:53.960
 That achieves the same kind of,

1:49:53.960 --> 1:49:56.440
 I mean, the smaller it is,

1:49:56.440 --> 1:49:59.080
 if we look at practically speaking,

1:49:59.080 --> 1:50:01.560
 the lower the cost of running the election,

1:50:01.560 --> 1:50:03.800
 of running through, of computing the circuit.

1:50:03.800 --> 1:50:04.640
 That is true.

1:50:04.640 --> 1:50:05.800
 But actually at this point,

1:50:05.800 --> 1:50:08.600
 the reason the question was interesting

1:50:08.600 --> 1:50:12.760
 is because there was no good guarantee

1:50:12.760 --> 1:50:15.440
 that the winner of that circuit

1:50:15.440 --> 1:50:18.440
 would have like have beaten a lot of people.

1:50:18.440 --> 1:50:19.680
 Let me give an example.

1:50:19.680 --> 1:50:20.800
 The best known circuit,

1:50:20.800 --> 1:50:22.400
 when we started thinking about this,

1:50:22.400 --> 1:50:24.760
 was the circuit called candidate one

1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:26.400
 plays against candidate two,

1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:28.640
 candidate three plays against four,

1:50:28.640 --> 1:50:30.480
 and then the winners play against each other.

1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:32.560
 And then by the way, five plays against six,

1:50:32.560 --> 1:50:34.640
 seven against eight, the winners play against each other.

1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:36.600
 You understand, it's like a giant binary tree.

1:50:36.600 --> 1:50:39.400
 Yeah, it's a binary, like a balanced binary tree.

1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:40.720
 It's a balanced binary tree.

1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:42.680
 One, two, three, four, up to 1,024,

1:50:42.680 --> 1:50:44.520
 everyone going up to find the winner.

1:50:44.520 --> 1:50:45.480
 Well, you know what?

1:50:45.480 --> 1:50:47.400
 There's a system in the world

1:50:47.400 --> 1:50:49.720
 where it could just be

1:50:49.720 --> 1:50:52.280
 that there's a candidate called number one,

1:50:52.280 --> 1:50:55.240
 that just beats like 10 other people,

1:50:56.200 --> 1:50:59.760
 just the 10 that they need to be on their way up

1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:01.320
 and they lose to everyone else.

1:51:02.240 --> 1:51:04.720
 But somehow they would get all the way up.

1:51:04.720 --> 1:51:09.720
 My point is it is possible to outsmart that circuit

1:51:11.040 --> 1:51:13.720
 in one weird way of the world,

1:51:13.720 --> 1:51:15.320
 which makes that circuit a bad one

1:51:15.320 --> 1:51:16.160
 because you want to say,

1:51:16.160 --> 1:51:18.920
 I will use this circuit for all elections.

1:51:18.920 --> 1:51:22.480
 And you might have a system of inputs that go in there

1:51:22.480 --> 1:51:24.800
 where the winner only beat 10 other people,

1:51:24.800 --> 1:51:26.720
 which is the people they had to beat on the way up.

1:51:26.720 --> 1:51:29.720
 So you want to have a circuit where there's as many,

1:51:29.720 --> 1:51:33.160
 like the final result is as strong as possible.

1:51:33.160 --> 1:51:34.200
 Yes.

1:51:34.200 --> 1:51:37.440
 And so what ideas do you have for that?

1:51:37.440 --> 1:51:40.480
 So we actually only managed to improve it

1:51:40.480 --> 1:51:41.800
 to square root of N.

1:51:41.800 --> 1:51:43.680
 So if N is number of vertices,

1:51:43.680 --> 1:51:46.080
 N over two would be the ideal.

1:51:46.080 --> 1:51:48.320
 We got it to square root of N.

1:51:48.320 --> 1:51:50.120
 Versus log base two.

1:51:50.120 --> 1:51:51.080
 Yeah, exactly.

1:51:51.080 --> 1:51:52.400
 Yeah.

1:51:52.400 --> 1:51:53.440
 Which is...

1:51:53.440 --> 1:51:54.280
 Well, that is halfway.

1:51:54.280 --> 1:51:55.920
 It could be a lot.

1:51:55.920 --> 1:51:56.760
 Yeah.

1:51:56.760 --> 1:51:57.760
 Could be a big improvement.

1:51:57.760 --> 1:51:59.000
 So that's a, okay, cool.

1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:01.600
 Is there something you can say with words

1:52:01.600 --> 1:52:04.600
 about what kind of circuit, what that looks like?

1:52:04.600 --> 1:52:08.040
 I can give an idea of one of the tools inside,

1:52:08.040 --> 1:52:10.560
 but the actual execution ends up being more complicated.

1:52:10.560 --> 1:52:12.800
 But one of the widgets inside this

1:52:12.800 --> 1:52:16.960
 is building a system where you have like a candidate

1:52:16.960 --> 1:52:20.720
 who plays, like one part of the whole huge, huge tree

1:52:20.720 --> 1:52:23.240
 is that that same candidate, let's call them seven.

1:52:23.240 --> 1:52:25.520
 Seven plays against somebody,

1:52:25.520 --> 1:52:26.680
 let's make up some numbers.

1:52:26.680 --> 1:52:27.920
 Let's call the others like letters.

1:52:27.920 --> 1:52:29.280
 So seven plays against A.

1:52:30.720 --> 1:52:33.680
 Seven's also gonna play against B separately.

1:52:33.680 --> 1:52:36.560
 And the winners of each of those will play each other.

1:52:36.560 --> 1:52:38.440
 By the way, seven's also gonna play C.

1:52:38.440 --> 1:52:39.680
 Seven's gonna play D.

1:52:39.680 --> 1:52:41.040
 And the winners are gonna play each other.

1:52:41.040 --> 1:52:42.520
 And the winners are gonna play each other.

1:52:42.520 --> 1:52:44.960
 We call this seven against all.

1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:47.720
 Well, seven against like everyone from a bunch of.

1:52:47.720 --> 1:52:48.560
 Got it.

1:52:48.560 --> 1:52:50.840
 So there's some nice overlap between the matchups

1:52:50.840 --> 1:52:53.000
 that somehow has a nice feature to it.

1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:54.200
 Yes, and I can tell you the nice feature

1:52:54.200 --> 1:52:56.480
 because if at the base of this giant tree,

1:52:56.480 --> 1:52:57.880
 at the base of this giant circuit,

1:52:57.880 --> 1:52:58.720
 like this is a widget.

1:52:58.720 --> 1:52:59.920
 We build the things out of widgets.

1:52:59.920 --> 1:53:01.320
 So I'm just describing one widget.

1:53:01.320 --> 1:53:03.400
 But in the base of this widget,

1:53:03.400 --> 1:53:05.560
 you have lots of things which are seven against someone,

1:53:05.560 --> 1:53:07.360
 seven against someone, seven against someone.

1:53:07.360 --> 1:53:09.800
 In fact, every matchup at the bottom

1:53:09.800 --> 1:53:11.520
 is seven against someone.

1:53:11.520 --> 1:53:12.840
 What that means is

1:53:12.840 --> 1:53:16.840
 if seven actually beat everyone they were matched up against,

1:53:16.840 --> 1:53:18.640
 well, seven would rise to the top.

1:53:18.640 --> 1:53:21.240
 So one possibility is if you see a seven

1:53:21.240 --> 1:53:22.360
 emerge from the top,

1:53:22.360 --> 1:53:24.280
 you know that seven actually beat everyone

1:53:24.280 --> 1:53:25.600
 they were against.

1:53:25.600 --> 1:53:28.360
 On the other hand, if anyone else is on top,

1:53:28.360 --> 1:53:29.600
 let's call it F.

1:53:29.600 --> 1:53:31.920
 If F is on top, how did F get there?

1:53:31.920 --> 1:53:34.640
 Well, F beat seven on the way at the beginning.

1:53:34.640 --> 1:53:37.000
 So the point is the outcome of this circuit

1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:38.400
 has a certain property.

1:53:38.400 --> 1:53:39.640
 If you see a seven,

1:53:39.640 --> 1:53:41.680
 you know that the seven actually beat a person

1:53:41.680 --> 1:53:43.960
 but the seven actually beat a bazillion people.

1:53:43.960 --> 1:53:45.240
 If you see anyone else,

1:53:45.240 --> 1:53:47.040
 at least you know they beat seven.

1:53:47.040 --> 1:53:49.880
 Yeah, then you can prove that it has a nice property.

1:53:49.880 --> 1:53:50.880
 That's really interesting.

1:53:50.880 --> 1:53:54.120
 Is there something you can say,

1:53:54.120 --> 1:53:55.760
 perhaps going completely outside

1:53:55.760 --> 1:53:56.720
 of what we're talking about,

1:53:56.720 --> 1:53:58.920
 is how we may

1:54:00.720 --> 1:54:03.040
 have mathematical ideas

1:54:03.040 --> 1:54:06.440
 of improving the electoral process?

1:54:06.440 --> 1:54:07.320
 That one, no.

1:54:07.320 --> 1:54:09.120
 No, I can't give you that one.

1:54:09.120 --> 1:54:11.760
 I mean, is there, like, do you ever see it as,

1:54:14.640 --> 1:54:17.400
 do you see as there being a lot of opportunities

1:54:17.400 --> 1:54:19.200
 for improving how we vote?

1:54:20.480 --> 1:54:23.720
 Like from your, I don't know if you saw parallels,

1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:26.560
 but, you know, it seems like if,

1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:29.680
 this actually kind of maps to your sort of COVID work,

1:54:29.680 --> 1:54:32.240
 which is there's a network effect, right?

1:54:32.240 --> 1:54:34.920
 It seems like we should be able to apply similar kind

1:54:34.920 --> 1:54:39.400
 of effects of how we decide other things in our lives.

1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:42.160
 And one of the big decisions we'll make

1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:44.480
 is who represents us in government.

1:54:44.480 --> 1:54:46.200
 Do you ever think about like mathematically

1:54:46.200 --> 1:54:48.160
 about those kinds of systems?

1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:49.520
 I think a little bit about those,

1:54:49.520 --> 1:54:51.480
 because where I went to college,

1:54:51.480 --> 1:54:53.200
 the way we voted for student government

1:54:53.200 --> 1:54:56.120
 was based on this, is it called ranked choice?

1:54:56.120 --> 1:54:58.600
 Where you eliminate the bottom

1:54:58.600 --> 1:55:00.840
 and there was runoff elections.

1:55:00.840 --> 1:55:02.840
 So that was the first time I ever saw that.

1:55:02.840 --> 1:55:04.480
 And I thought that made sense.

1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:06.920
 The only problem is it doesn't seem so easy

1:55:06.920 --> 1:55:08.520
 to get something that makes sense adopted

1:55:08.520 --> 1:55:09.760
 as the new voting system.

1:55:09.760 --> 1:55:12.760
 That's a whole nother, that's not a math solution.

1:55:12.760 --> 1:55:16.040
 That's a, well, it's math in the sense that it's game theory.

1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:17.280
 So you have to come up with incentive,

1:55:17.280 --> 1:55:18.320
 it's mechanism design.

1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:21.040
 You have to figure out how to trick us

1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:24.280
 despite our basic human nature

1:55:24.280 --> 1:55:27.600
 to adopt solutions that are better.

1:55:27.600 --> 1:55:30.520
 That's a whole nother conversation, I think.

1:55:30.520 --> 1:55:33.240
 Can you just, cause it sounded really cool,

1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:36.120
 talk a little bit about stochastic coalescence

1:55:36.120 --> 1:55:39.400
 and you have a paper on showing that,

1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:40.760
 so you could describe what it is,

1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:44.760
 but I guess it's a super linear, super logarithmic time

1:55:44.760 --> 1:55:46.360
 and you came up with some kind of trick

1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:47.960
 that make it faster.

1:55:47.960 --> 1:55:49.280
 Can you just talk about it a little bit?

1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:51.680
 Yeah, so this was something which came up

1:55:51.680 --> 1:55:54.160
 when I was at Microsoft Research for a summer.

1:55:54.160 --> 1:55:56.680
 And I'm putting that context because that shows

1:55:56.680 --> 1:55:59.560
 that it has some practical motivation at some point.

1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:01.920
 Actually, I think it's still.

1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:02.840
 It doesn't need to.

1:56:02.840 --> 1:56:03.680
 It doesn't need to.

1:56:03.680 --> 1:56:05.160
 It can be beautiful and it's all right.

1:56:05.160 --> 1:56:07.360
 Yeah, so the easiest way to describe this is

1:56:07.360 --> 1:56:09.920
 suppose you got like a big crowd of people

1:56:09.920 --> 1:56:12.120
 and everybody knows how many hours of sleep

1:56:12.120 --> 1:56:13.240
 they got last night.

1:56:13.240 --> 1:56:15.240
 And you wanna know how many total hours of sleep

1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:17.560
 were gotten by this big crowd of people.

1:56:17.560 --> 1:56:18.760
 At the beginning, you might say,

1:56:18.760 --> 1:56:20.680
 that sounds like a linear time algorithm

1:56:20.680 --> 1:56:22.680
 of saying, hey, how many hours you got?

1:56:22.680 --> 1:56:23.520
 How many you got?

1:56:23.520 --> 1:56:24.360
 How many you got?

1:56:24.360 --> 1:56:25.560
 Add, add, add.

1:56:25.560 --> 1:56:26.760
 But there's a way to do this

1:56:26.760 --> 1:56:28.520
 if you remember that there are people

1:56:28.520 --> 1:56:30.360
 and they presumably know how to add.

1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:32.160
 You could make a distributed algorithm

1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:33.400
 to make this happen.

1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:35.840
 For example, while we're thinking of these trees,

1:56:35.840 --> 1:56:38.560
 imagine you had 1,024 people.

1:56:38.560 --> 1:56:40.720
 If you could just say, hey, person number one

1:56:40.720 --> 1:56:43.840
 and person number two, you will add your hours of sleep.

1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:46.040
 Person number two will go away

1:56:46.040 --> 1:56:48.360
 and person number one is gonna remember the sum.

1:56:48.360 --> 1:56:50.920
 Person three and four add up

1:56:50.920 --> 1:56:53.760
 and person three takes charge of remembering it.

1:56:53.760 --> 1:56:54.840
 Person four goes away.

1:56:54.840 --> 1:56:56.960
 Now this like person one knows the sum of these two.

1:56:56.960 --> 1:56:58.160
 Person three knows the sum of those two.

1:56:58.160 --> 1:56:59.000
 They talk.

1:56:59.000 --> 1:56:59.840
 You see what I mean?

1:56:59.840 --> 1:57:02.200
 You're going up this tree,

1:57:02.200 --> 1:57:03.600
 same tree that we talked about earlier.

1:57:03.600 --> 1:57:05.920
 Built up a tree from the bottom up.

1:57:05.920 --> 1:57:07.560
 Yeah, build up a tree from the bottom up.

1:57:07.560 --> 1:57:09.160
 And the beautiful thing is

1:57:09.160 --> 1:57:11.360
 since everyone's doing stuff in parallel,

1:57:11.360 --> 1:57:14.560
 the amount of time it takes to get the total sum

1:57:14.560 --> 1:57:17.360
 is actually just the number of layers in the tree,

1:57:17.360 --> 1:57:18.960
 which is 10.

1:57:18.960 --> 1:57:20.360
 So now that's logarithmic time

1:57:20.360 --> 1:57:23.720
 to add up the number of hours that people slept today.

1:57:23.720 --> 1:57:25.240
 Sounds fantastic.

1:57:25.240 --> 1:57:26.400
 There's only one problem.

1:57:26.400 --> 1:57:27.960
 How do you decide who's person number one

1:57:27.960 --> 1:57:29.720
 and person number two?

1:57:29.720 --> 1:57:30.560
 Yes.

1:57:30.560 --> 1:57:32.680
 So if, for example, you just went out into the downtown

1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:34.760
 and said, hey, get these thousand people, go.

1:57:34.760 --> 1:57:35.960
 Well, if you're gonna go and say,

1:57:35.960 --> 1:57:37.720
 and by the way, you're one and you're two and you're three,

1:57:37.720 --> 1:57:38.760
 that's linear time.

1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:39.640
 Yes.

1:57:39.640 --> 1:57:40.480
 That's cheating.

1:57:40.480 --> 1:57:41.800
 So now the question is how to do this

1:57:41.800 --> 1:57:43.000
 in a distributed way.

1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:44.840
 And there were some people who proposed

1:57:44.840 --> 1:57:48.880
 a very elegant algorithm and they wanted to analyze it.

1:57:48.880 --> 1:57:50.680
 So I came in onto the analyze side,

1:57:50.680 --> 1:57:52.800
 but the elegant algorithm was like this.

1:57:52.800 --> 1:57:55.760
 It was like, well, we don't actually know

1:57:55.760 --> 1:57:57.640
 what this big tree is.

1:57:57.640 --> 1:57:58.880
 There isn't any big tree.

1:57:58.880 --> 1:58:01.040
 So what's gonna happen is first,

1:58:01.040 --> 1:58:04.280
 everyone is going to decide right now.

1:58:04.280 --> 1:58:05.680
 Oh, one important thing.

1:58:05.680 --> 1:58:07.000
 Everyone is going to,

1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:09.960
 at the very beginning of the whole game,

1:58:09.960 --> 1:58:13.400
 they will have delegated responsibility to themselves

1:58:13.400 --> 1:58:16.400
 as the one who knows the sum so far.

1:58:16.400 --> 1:58:18.920
 So the point is there's gonna be,

1:58:18.920 --> 1:58:22.120
 people are all gonna have like a pointer which says,

1:58:22.120 --> 1:58:24.440
 you are the one who knows my,

1:58:24.440 --> 1:58:26.680
 you've taken care of my ticket, my number.

1:58:26.680 --> 1:58:27.520
 Yeah.

1:58:27.520 --> 1:58:30.560
 You're the representative for this particular piece

1:58:30.560 --> 1:58:31.400
 of knowledge.

1:58:31.400 --> 1:58:33.680
 And at the very beginning, you're your own representative.

1:58:33.680 --> 1:58:35.120
 The thing has to start simple, right?

1:58:35.120 --> 1:58:36.440
 So at the beginning, you're your own representative.

1:58:36.440 --> 1:58:38.040
 You're pointing to yourself, got it.

1:58:38.040 --> 1:58:38.880
 Yup, yup.

1:58:38.880 --> 1:58:41.560
 And now the way this works is that at every time step,

1:58:41.560 --> 1:58:45.840
 someone blares a ding dong on the town clock or whatever.

1:58:45.840 --> 1:58:48.680
 And each person flips a coin themselves to decide,

1:58:48.680 --> 1:58:53.600
 am I going to hunt for somebody to give my number to

1:58:53.600 --> 1:58:55.120
 and let them represent me?

1:58:55.120 --> 1:58:58.920
 Or am I going to sit here and wait for someone to come?

1:58:58.920 --> 1:58:59.960
 Okay.

1:58:59.960 --> 1:59:00.800
 Okay.

1:59:00.800 --> 1:59:02.600
 Well, they flipped their coin.

1:59:02.600 --> 1:59:04.840
 Some of the people start asking other people saying,

1:59:04.840 --> 1:59:08.560
 hey, I would like you to be my representative.

1:59:08.560 --> 1:59:10.200
 Here is my number.

1:59:10.200 --> 1:59:12.040
 But the problem is that there's limited bandwidth

1:59:12.040 --> 1:59:13.240
 of the people who are getting asked.

1:59:13.240 --> 1:59:14.440
 It's like, you can't get,

1:59:14.440 --> 1:59:16.680
 you can't go out to prom with five people.

1:59:16.680 --> 1:59:17.840
 But this is not what we're doing.

1:59:17.840 --> 1:59:19.160
 We're adding numbers, okay?

1:59:19.160 --> 1:59:20.720
 But you can only add one number.

1:59:20.720 --> 1:59:22.600
 So the person who has suddenly gotten asked

1:59:22.600 --> 1:59:23.920
 by all these people,

1:59:23.920 --> 1:59:25.720
 well, they'll have to decide who they're going

1:59:25.720 --> 1:59:27.280
 to take it from.

1:59:27.280 --> 1:59:29.440
 And they randomly just choose one.

1:59:29.440 --> 1:59:30.720
 When they randomly choose one,

1:59:30.720 --> 1:59:31.880
 all the others are rejected

1:59:31.880 --> 1:59:34.920
 and they don't get to delegate anything in that round.

1:59:34.920 --> 1:59:38.360
 But now if this person has absorbed this one who said,

1:59:38.360 --> 1:59:40.680
 okay, here, you take charge of my number.

1:59:40.680 --> 1:59:42.600
 This person now updates their pointer.

1:59:42.600 --> 1:59:44.000
 You're in charge.

1:59:44.840 --> 1:59:46.640
 And this person adds the two numbers.

1:59:47.680 --> 1:59:48.920
 That was the first round.

1:59:50.000 --> 1:59:52.840
 In the next round, when they do the coin flipping,

1:59:52.840 --> 1:59:54.280
 this person doesn't flip anymore

1:59:54.280 --> 1:59:56.120
 because they're just delegating.

1:59:56.120 --> 1:59:59.000
 It's that anyone who has the pointers themselves,

1:59:59.000 --> 2:00:01.600
 that's like a person who is in charge

2:00:01.600 --> 2:00:03.320
 of some number of informations,

2:00:03.320 --> 2:00:04.680
 they flip the coin to decide,

2:00:04.680 --> 2:00:08.240
 should I find other people who are agents?

2:00:08.240 --> 2:00:10.040
 Or should I wait for people to ask me?

2:00:10.040 --> 2:00:10.880
 Yes.

2:00:10.880 --> 2:00:11.720
 Brilliant.

2:00:11.720 --> 2:00:12.840
 This is somebody else's idea.

2:00:12.840 --> 2:00:14.320
 And then now the idea is, okay,

2:00:14.320 --> 2:00:15.720
 if you just keep doing this process,

2:00:15.720 --> 2:00:16.920
 what ends up happening?

2:00:16.920 --> 2:00:18.680
 Oh yeah, and also by the way,

2:00:18.680 --> 2:00:20.320
 if you decide that you want to go reach out

2:00:20.320 --> 2:00:23.120
 to other people, here's the catch.

2:00:23.120 --> 2:00:24.680
 When you're one of these agents saying,

2:00:24.680 --> 2:00:27.400
 okay, I'm going to go look for someone.

2:00:27.400 --> 2:00:30.760
 You have no idea who in this crowd is an agent

2:00:30.760 --> 2:00:33.400
 or somebody who delegated it to someone else.

2:00:33.400 --> 2:00:35.640
 You just pick a random person.

2:00:35.640 --> 2:00:37.080
 When you pick the random person,

2:00:37.080 --> 2:00:38.880
 if it lands on someone and the person says,

2:00:38.880 --> 2:00:41.840
 oh, I actually delegated it to someone,

2:00:41.840 --> 2:00:43.240
 then you follow the point.

2:00:43.240 --> 2:00:45.280
 You walk up the delegation chain.

2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:46.120
 Walk up the delegation chain.

2:00:46.120 --> 2:00:49.080
 And you can do like path compression in the algorithm

2:00:49.080 --> 2:00:50.560
 to make it so you don't consistently

2:00:50.560 --> 2:00:52.040
 do lots of walking up.

2:00:52.040 --> 2:00:54.680
 But the bottom line is that what ends up happening

2:00:54.680 --> 2:00:57.240
 is that you end up reaching out.

2:00:57.240 --> 2:00:59.080
 Whenever you're one of the ones reaching out,

2:00:59.080 --> 2:01:01.840
 you can think of it as each agent is responsible

2:01:01.840 --> 2:01:03.320
 for some number of people.

2:01:03.320 --> 2:01:05.480
 It's almost like they're the leader of a bunch.

2:01:05.480 --> 2:01:09.920
 As the process is evolving, you have these lumps.

2:01:09.920 --> 2:01:11.680
 Each lump has an agent.

2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:13.360
 And when the agent reaches out,

2:01:13.360 --> 2:01:15.680
 they reach out to another lump

2:01:15.680 --> 2:01:18.160
 where the probability of them hitting that lump

2:01:18.160 --> 2:01:20.160
 is proportional to the size of the lump.

2:01:21.880 --> 2:01:25.720
 That is the one funny thing about this process.

2:01:25.720 --> 2:01:27.360
 This is not that they can reach out

2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:29.280
 to a uniformly random lump

2:01:29.280 --> 2:01:30.920
 where every lump has the same chance

2:01:30.920 --> 2:01:32.440
 of getting reached out to.

2:01:32.440 --> 2:01:34.520
 The bigger the lump is,

2:01:34.520 --> 2:01:38.760
 the more likely it is that you end up reaching that lump.

2:01:38.760 --> 2:01:40.160
 Which is a problem?

2:01:40.160 --> 2:01:41.600
 Let me explain why that's a problem.

2:01:41.600 --> 2:01:43.280
 Because you see, you're hoping

2:01:43.280 --> 2:01:45.400
 that this has a small number of steps,

2:01:45.400 --> 2:01:47.680
 but here's a bad situation that could happen.

2:01:47.680 --> 2:01:50.000
 Imagine if you had like,

2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.040
 there are n people that you're adding up.

2:01:52.040 --> 2:01:57.040
 Imagine that you have exactly square root of n lumps left,

2:01:57.040 --> 2:02:01.440
 of which almost all of them are just one person

2:02:01.440 --> 2:02:04.280
 who's still their own boss, their own manager.

2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:06.080
 Except one giant one.

2:02:06.080 --> 2:02:06.920
 Now what's gonna happen?

2:02:06.920 --> 2:02:08.360
 It's gonna be a huge bottleneck

2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:09.760
 because every round the giant one

2:02:09.760 --> 2:02:11.880
 can only absorb one of the others.

2:02:11.880 --> 2:02:13.560
 And now you suddenly have time

2:02:13.560 --> 2:02:15.680
 which is about square root of n.

2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:16.840
 The square root of n is chosen

2:02:16.840 --> 2:02:20.280
 because that is one where the lumps are such

2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:23.560
 that you really are limited by this large one

2:02:23.560 --> 2:02:26.000
 slowly sucking up the rest of them.

2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:28.160
 So the heart of the question became,

2:02:28.160 --> 2:02:30.040
 well, but is that just so unusual

2:02:30.040 --> 2:02:32.760
 that it doesn't usually happen?

2:02:32.760 --> 2:02:34.680
 Because remember you start with everyone

2:02:34.680 --> 2:02:36.080
 just being independent.

2:02:36.080 --> 2:02:37.640
 It's like a lot of lumps of size one.

2:02:37.640 --> 2:02:39.640
 How naturally do the big lumps emerge?

2:02:39.640 --> 2:02:40.480
 Yes.

2:02:40.480 --> 2:02:42.120
 And so what that heart of the proof was,

2:02:42.120 --> 2:02:45.120
 was showing that that was a joint work with Eyal Lubezki.

2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:49.040
 That one was showing that actually in that thing

2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:50.920
 the lumps do kind of get out of whack.

2:02:50.920 --> 2:02:54.720
 And so it's not the purely logarithmic number of steps.

2:02:54.720 --> 2:02:56.720
 But if you make one very slight change,

2:02:56.720 --> 2:03:00.400
 which is if you are one of the agents

2:03:00.400 --> 2:03:02.400
 and you have just been propositioned,

2:03:02.400 --> 2:03:05.320
 possibly relayed along by a couple of different people.

2:03:05.320 --> 2:03:07.600
 If you just say, don't take a random one,

2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:10.360
 but accept the smallest lump.

2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:14.400
 That actually does enough to even the whole economy.

2:03:14.400 --> 2:03:16.320
 Distributes the lump size.

2:03:16.320 --> 2:03:17.800
 I mean, yeah, it's fascinating how

2:03:17.800 --> 2:03:19.000
 with the distributed algorithms,

2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:21.520
 a little adjustment can make all the difference

2:03:21.520 --> 2:03:22.440
 in the world.

2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:23.280
 Yeah.

2:03:23.280 --> 2:03:25.320
 Actually, by the way, this does,

2:03:25.320 --> 2:03:26.960
 back to our voting conversation,

2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:28.480
 this makes me think of like,

2:03:29.440 --> 2:03:32.240
 these networking systems are so fascinating to study.

2:03:32.240 --> 2:03:35.120
 They immediately spring to mind ideas

2:03:35.120 --> 2:03:37.680
 of how to have representation.

2:03:37.680 --> 2:03:42.240
 Like maybe as opposed to me voting for a president,

2:03:42.240 --> 2:03:45.600
 I want to vote for like,

2:03:45.600 --> 2:03:48.400
 for you, Paul, to represent me,

2:03:48.400 --> 2:03:50.600
 maybe on a particular issue.

2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:52.560
 And then you will delegate that further.

2:03:52.560 --> 2:03:55.120
 And then we naturally construct those kinds of networks

2:03:55.120 --> 2:03:58.880
 because that feels like I can have a good conversation

2:03:58.880 --> 2:04:00.760
 with you and figure out that you know what you're doing

2:04:00.760 --> 2:04:01.800
 and I can delegate it to you.

2:04:01.800 --> 2:04:05.560
 And in that way, construct a representative government,

2:04:05.560 --> 2:04:08.440
 a representative decision maker.

2:04:08.440 --> 2:04:12.480
 That feels really nice as opposed to like us,

2:04:12.480 --> 2:04:14.600
 like a tree of height one or something,

2:04:14.600 --> 2:04:16.280
 where it's like everybody's just,

2:04:18.400 --> 2:04:20.440
 it feels like there's a lot of room for layers

2:04:20.440 --> 2:04:23.840
 of representation to form organically from the bottom up.

2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:25.400
 I wonder if there are systems like that.

2:04:25.400 --> 2:04:27.080
 This is the cool thing about the internet

2:04:27.080 --> 2:04:29.560
 and the digital space where we're so well connected,

2:04:29.560 --> 2:04:34.080
 just like with the Novid app to distribute information

2:04:34.080 --> 2:04:37.000
 about the spread of the disease.

2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:39.280
 We can in the same way, in a distributed sense,

2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:44.280
 form anything like any kind of knowledge bases

2:04:44.880 --> 2:04:48.760
 that are formed in a decentralized way

2:04:48.760 --> 2:04:51.480
 and in a hierarchical way,

2:04:51.480 --> 2:04:54.320
 as opposed to sort of old way

2:04:54.320 --> 2:04:56.840
 where there is no mechanism for large scale,

2:04:56.840 --> 2:05:01.760
 fast distributed transactional information.

2:05:01.760 --> 2:05:02.600
 This is really interesting.

2:05:02.600 --> 2:05:06.800
 This is where almost like network graph theory,

2:05:06.800 --> 2:05:07.920
 becomes practical.

2:05:09.280 --> 2:05:11.840
 Most of that exciting work was done in the 20th century,

2:05:11.840 --> 2:05:14.080
 but most of the application will be in the 21st,

2:05:14.080 --> 2:05:15.960
 which is cool to think about.

2:05:15.960 --> 2:05:17.720
 Let me ask the most ridiculous question.

2:05:17.720 --> 2:05:19.880
 You think P equals NP?

2:05:19.880 --> 2:05:21.240
 Wow.

2:05:21.240 --> 2:05:22.360
 I don't know.

2:05:22.360 --> 2:05:23.800
 I mean, I would say,

2:05:26.640 --> 2:05:29.520
 I know there are enough people who have very strong interest

2:05:29.520 --> 2:05:31.520
 in trying to show that it is.

2:05:32.680 --> 2:05:34.760
 I'm talking about government agencies.

2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:38.520
 For security purposes.

2:05:38.520 --> 2:05:39.360
 For security purposes.

2:05:39.360 --> 2:05:40.560
 And most computer scientists,

2:05:40.560 --> 2:05:42.920
 we should say believe that P equals NP.

2:05:43.800 --> 2:05:45.280
 My question almost like,

2:05:45.280 --> 2:05:47.000
 this is back to our aliens discussion.

2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:48.440
 You want to think outside the box,

2:05:48.440 --> 2:05:50.960
 the low probability event,

2:05:51.800 --> 2:05:53.120
 what is the world,

2:05:54.040 --> 2:05:58.640
 what kind of discoveries would lead us to prove

2:05:58.640 --> 2:06:01.560
 that P does not equal to NP?

2:06:01.560 --> 2:06:05.480
 Like there could be giant misunderstandings

2:06:05.480 --> 2:06:08.080
 or gaps in our knowledge about computer science,

2:06:08.080 --> 2:06:11.040
 about theoretical computer science, about computation,

2:06:11.040 --> 2:06:14.800
 which allow us to think like flatten all problems.

2:06:14.800 --> 2:06:17.080
 Yeah, so I don't know the answer to this question.

2:06:17.080 --> 2:06:19.440
 I think it's very interesting, but I actually,

2:06:19.440 --> 2:06:21.280
 I know, let's put it this way.

2:06:21.280 --> 2:06:22.520
 By being at Carnegie Mellon

2:06:22.520 --> 2:06:24.880
 and being around the theoretical computer scientists,

2:06:24.880 --> 2:06:27.920
 I know enough about what I don't know to say.

2:06:27.920 --> 2:06:28.760
 To be humble.

2:06:28.760 --> 2:06:32.320
 I'm the wrong person to answer this question.

2:06:32.320 --> 2:06:33.240
 It's a great one.

2:06:33.240 --> 2:06:35.920
 Well, Scott Aaronson, who's now here at UT Austin,

2:06:35.920 --> 2:06:37.800
 he used to be at MIT,

2:06:37.800 --> 2:06:42.800
 puts the probability of P not equals to NP at 3%.

2:06:45.920 --> 2:06:48.040
 I always love it when you ask,

2:06:48.040 --> 2:06:51.040
 it's very rare in science and academics

2:06:51.040 --> 2:06:53.760
 because most folks are humble

2:06:54.680 --> 2:06:56.800
 in the face of the mystery,

2:06:56.800 --> 2:06:59.400
 the uncertainty of everything around us.

2:06:59.400 --> 2:07:03.360
 To have both the humor and the guts to say like,

2:07:03.360 --> 2:07:07.160
 what are the chance that there's aliens in our galaxy,

2:07:07.160 --> 2:07:09.440
 intelligent alien civilizations?

2:07:09.440 --> 2:07:12.280
 As opposed to saying, I don't know, it could be zero.

2:07:12.280 --> 2:07:15.920
 It could be, depending on the fact, you're saying it's 2.5%.

2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:20.280
 There's something very pleasant about just having,

2:07:20.280 --> 2:07:22.400
 it's the number thing.

2:07:24.400 --> 2:07:25.480
 It's powered to the number.

2:07:25.480 --> 2:07:26.440
 It's just like 42.

2:07:26.440 --> 2:07:27.280
 It's like, why 42?

2:07:27.280 --> 2:07:29.640
 I don't know, but it's a powerful number.

2:07:29.640 --> 2:07:30.640
 And then everything,

2:07:30.640 --> 2:07:32.600
 this is the power of human psychology

2:07:32.600 --> 2:07:34.760
 is once you have the number 42,

2:07:36.560 --> 2:07:39.240
 it's not that the number has meaning,

2:07:39.240 --> 2:07:43.960
 but because it's placed in a book with humor around it,

2:07:43.960 --> 2:07:48.960
 it has the meme effect of actually creating reality.

2:07:49.400 --> 2:07:53.520
 I mean, you could say that 42 has a strong contribution

2:07:53.520 --> 2:07:55.920
 of helping us colonize Mars

2:07:55.920 --> 2:07:57.720
 because it created,

2:07:57.720 --> 2:08:00.480
 it gave the whatever existential crisis to many of us,

2:08:00.480 --> 2:08:03.160
 including Elon Musk when he was young,

2:08:03.160 --> 2:08:04.280
 reading a book like that.

2:08:04.280 --> 2:08:07.040
 And then now 42 is now part of his humor

2:08:07.040 --> 2:08:08.840
 that he doesn't shut up about,

2:08:08.840 --> 2:08:09.680
 it's constantly joking about.

2:08:09.680 --> 2:08:12.200
 And that humor is spreading through our minds

2:08:12.200 --> 2:08:15.160
 and somehow this like silly number just had an effect.

2:08:15.160 --> 2:08:19.360
 In that same way, after Scott told me like the 3% chance,

2:08:19.360 --> 2:08:20.680
 it's stuck in my head.

2:08:20.680 --> 2:08:22.720
 And I think it's been having a ripple effect

2:08:22.720 --> 2:08:23.720
 in everybody else.

2:08:23.720 --> 2:08:27.720
 The believing that P is not equal to NP,

2:08:29.120 --> 2:08:32.200
 Scott almost as a joke saying it's 3%

2:08:32.200 --> 2:08:34.920
 is actually motivating a large number of researchers

2:08:34.920 --> 2:08:35.760
 to work on it.

2:08:35.760 --> 2:08:37.080
 3% is high.

2:08:37.080 --> 2:08:37.920
 It's very high.

2:08:37.920 --> 2:08:39.920
 Because for the potential impact that that would have.

2:08:39.920 --> 2:08:44.280
 But then 3% is not that high because it's only,

2:08:44.280 --> 2:08:46.480
 you know, like we're not very good.

2:08:46.480 --> 2:08:48.840
 I feel like humans are only able to really think about

2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:51.280
 like 1%, 50%.

2:08:51.280 --> 2:08:55.400
 And we kind of, I think a lot of people around 3%

2:08:55.400 --> 2:08:58.800
 up to 50% like in our minds.

2:08:58.800 --> 2:09:00.640
 Like 3% at this point.

2:09:00.640 --> 2:09:01.480
 It could happen.

2:09:01.480 --> 2:09:02.480
 It could happen.

2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:04.760
 And it could happen and it's like, yeah.

2:09:04.760 --> 2:09:07.040
 Like half the time it'll probably happen.

2:09:07.040 --> 2:09:08.200
 So we're not very good at that.

2:09:08.200 --> 2:09:10.240
 That's the other thing with the pandemic

2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:13.560
 is we're not the exponential growth

2:09:13.560 --> 2:09:15.800
 that we also talked about offline

2:09:15.800 --> 2:09:20.200
 is something that we can't quite intuit.

2:09:20.200 --> 2:09:22.680
 And that's something we probably should

2:09:22.680 --> 2:09:25.240
 if we're to predict the future, to anticipate the future

2:09:25.240 --> 2:09:27.920
 and to understand how to create technologies

2:09:27.920 --> 2:09:30.680
 that let us sort of control the future.

2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:35.040
 Can I ask you for some recommendations

2:09:35.040 --> 2:09:38.240
 maybe for books or movies in your life?

2:09:39.120 --> 2:09:43.600
 Long ago when you were baby Po or today

2:09:45.320 --> 2:09:50.160
 that you found insightful or you learned a lot from

2:09:50.160 --> 2:09:52.080
 what you would recommend to others.

2:09:52.080 --> 2:09:52.920
 Yeah.

2:09:52.920 --> 2:09:55.760
 So I think I don't necessarily have an exact name

2:09:55.760 --> 2:09:58.600
 of these old things, but I was generally inspired

2:09:58.600 --> 2:10:03.600
 by stories, true or fictional of campaigns.

2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:09.080
 For example, like the Lord of the rings, that's a campaign.

2:10:09.080 --> 2:10:11.400
 But the thing that always inspired me was

2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:16.480
 it could be possible for somebody who's crazy enough

2:10:16.480 --> 2:10:18.680
 to go up against adversity after adversity,

2:10:18.680 --> 2:10:20.240
 and it succeeds.

2:10:20.240 --> 2:10:23.040
 I mean, those are false, those are fictitious.

2:10:23.040 --> 2:10:25.480
 But I also spent a lot of time, I guess, reading about,

2:10:25.480 --> 2:10:26.600
 I don't know, I was interested somehow

2:10:26.600 --> 2:10:29.520
 in like World War II history for whatever reason.

2:10:29.520 --> 2:10:31.440
 That's a campaign which is much more brutal.

2:10:31.440 --> 2:10:36.440
 But nevertheless, the idea of difficulty, strategy,

2:10:37.560 --> 2:10:39.480
 fighting even when things,

2:10:39.480 --> 2:10:40.800
 in that case it was really fighting,

2:10:40.800 --> 2:10:43.600
 but just pushing on even when things are difficult.

2:10:43.600 --> 2:10:46.840
 I guess these are the kinds of general stories

2:10:46.840 --> 2:10:50.880
 that made me, I guess, want to work on things

2:10:50.880 --> 2:10:54.920
 that would be hard and where it could be a campaign.

2:10:54.920 --> 2:10:57.520
 It could be that you work on something for a year,

2:10:57.520 --> 2:11:02.200
 multiple years, because that was the point, I guess.

2:11:02.200 --> 2:11:04.160
 Yeah, it starts with a single person.

2:11:04.160 --> 2:11:05.680
 That's the interesting thing.

2:11:05.680 --> 2:11:08.880
 I've obviously been, don't shut up about it recently

2:11:08.880 --> 2:11:11.400
 about World War II, especially on the Hitler side

2:11:11.400 --> 2:11:12.640
 and the Stalin side.

2:11:12.640 --> 2:11:15.600
 Some of that has really affected my own family.

2:11:15.600 --> 2:11:18.760
 The roots of my family very much.

2:11:18.760 --> 2:11:23.760
 But it's interesting to think that it was just an idea

2:11:24.840 --> 2:11:26.920
 and one person decided to do stuff

2:11:26.920 --> 2:11:29.520
 and it just builds and builds and builds.

2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:31.840
 And you can truly have an impact on the world,

2:11:31.840 --> 2:11:36.840
 both horrendous and exceptionally positive and inspiring.

2:11:36.840 --> 2:11:41.840
 So yeah, it's like it's a agency of us individuals.

2:11:47.840 --> 2:11:49.920
 Sometimes we think we're just reacting to the world,

2:11:49.920 --> 2:11:53.080
 but we have the full power to actually change the world.

2:11:53.080 --> 2:11:56.040
 Is there advice you can give to young folks?

2:11:56.040 --> 2:11:58.000
 We talked, we gave a bunch of advice

2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:00.600
 on middle school, high school mathematics.

2:12:00.600 --> 2:12:02.480
 Is there more general advice you would give

2:12:02.480 --> 2:12:04.800
 about how to succeed in life,

2:12:04.800 --> 2:12:07.400
 how to learn for high school students,

2:12:07.400 --> 2:12:10.600
 for college students, career or life in general?

2:12:10.600 --> 2:12:12.280
 So I think the first one would be

2:12:12.280 --> 2:12:14.680
 to make sure that you're learning to invent

2:12:14.680 --> 2:12:19.080
 and to make sure you're not just learning how to mimic.

2:12:19.080 --> 2:12:21.880
 Because a lot of times you learn how to do X

2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:24.280
 by watching somebody do X and then repeating X

2:12:24.280 --> 2:12:26.360
 many times with different inputs.

2:12:26.360 --> 2:12:28.520
 I've just been very generic in explaining this.

2:12:28.520 --> 2:12:31.840
 But I guess this is just my own attitude towards the world.

2:12:31.840 --> 2:12:34.920
 I didn't like ever following anyone's directions exactly.

2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:37.680
 Even if you told me this is the way to do your homework

2:12:37.680 --> 2:12:39.400
 is to write in pencil, I would say,

2:12:39.400 --> 2:12:42.880
 but I think pen is nice, let's try, right?

2:12:42.880 --> 2:12:45.640
 So I've been that kind of a funny person.

2:12:45.640 --> 2:12:50.640
 But I do encourage that if you can learn how to invent

2:12:50.720 --> 2:12:52.760
 as your core skill, then you can do a lot.

2:12:52.760 --> 2:12:54.320
 But then the second piece that comes with that

2:12:54.320 --> 2:12:57.400
 is something I learned from my PhD advisor,

2:12:57.400 --> 2:13:01.040
 which was, well, make sure that what you're working on

2:13:01.040 --> 2:13:02.280
 is big enough.

2:13:02.280 --> 2:13:04.760
 And so in that sense, I usually advise to people

2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:06.560
 once they have learned how to invent,

2:13:07.600 --> 2:13:11.520
 ideally don't just try to settle for something comfortable,

2:13:11.520 --> 2:13:15.000
 try to see if you can aim for something which is hard,

2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:18.000
 which might involve a campaign, which might be important,

2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:20.000
 which might make a difference.

2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:23.920
 And it's more of, I guess, rather than worrying

2:13:23.920 --> 2:13:25.960
 what if you didn't achieve that,

2:13:27.040 --> 2:13:30.320
 there's also the regret of what if I didn't try?

2:13:30.320 --> 2:13:31.600
 See, that's how I operate.

2:13:31.600 --> 2:13:33.720
 I don't operate based on did I succeed or fail?

2:13:33.720 --> 2:13:34.640
 It was hard anyway.

2:13:34.640 --> 2:13:36.640
 If I did this novid thing and the whole thing failed,

2:13:36.640 --> 2:13:37.640
 would I feel terrible?

2:13:37.640 --> 2:13:39.480
 No, it's a very hard problem.

2:13:39.480 --> 2:13:42.640
 But would I have had the regret of not jumping in?

2:13:42.640 --> 2:13:44.080
 Yes.

2:13:44.080 --> 2:13:46.000
 So it's that different mentality of don't worry

2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:48.680
 about the failing part as much of the,

2:13:48.680 --> 2:13:50.760
 make sure you give yourself the shot

2:13:50.760 --> 2:13:53.700
 at those potentially unbounded opportunities.

2:13:55.160 --> 2:13:58.320
 You almost make it sound like there's a meaning to it all.

2:13:58.320 --> 2:13:59.960
 Let me ask the big ridiculous question.

2:13:59.960 --> 2:14:01.840
 What do you think is the meaning of life?

2:14:01.840 --> 2:14:04.200
 Or maybe the easier version of that

2:14:04.200 --> 2:14:06.120
 is what brings your life joy?

2:14:06.120 --> 2:14:07.880
 So I'll just answer that one personally.

2:14:07.880 --> 2:14:10.080
 For me, I'm a little bit weird.

2:14:10.080 --> 2:14:13.520
 I sort of, I guess you can tell by now.

2:14:13.520 --> 2:14:15.960
 See the pen and pencil discussion from earlier, yes.

2:14:15.960 --> 2:14:16.920
 Yeah, yeah.

2:14:16.920 --> 2:14:20.360
 So, I mean, my thing is, I guess I personally

2:14:20.360 --> 2:14:24.360
 just wanted to maximize a certain score,

2:14:24.360 --> 2:14:28.160
 which was for how many person years

2:14:28.160 --> 2:14:31.000
 after I'm no longer here anymore,

2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:33.400
 did what I do mattered?

2:14:33.400 --> 2:14:34.240
 Yeah.

2:14:34.240 --> 2:14:36.480
 And it didn't matter if it's necessarily attributed to me.

2:14:36.480 --> 2:14:38.600
 It's just like, did it matter?

2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:41.800
 And so that's what I wanted.

2:14:41.800 --> 2:14:45.620
 I guess that is very inspired by how scientists work.

2:14:45.620 --> 2:14:47.760
 It's like, why do we keep talking about Newton?

2:14:47.760 --> 2:14:50.840
 It's because Newton discovered some interesting things.

2:14:50.840 --> 2:14:52.640
 And so Newton's score is pretty high.

2:14:53.880 --> 2:14:56.240
 It's going to be infinity, right?

2:14:56.240 --> 2:14:59.040
 Well, let's hope it's infinity, but pretty high.

2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:00.120
 Yes, yes.

2:15:00.120 --> 2:15:03.780
 So you're going for, so person years,

2:15:03.780 --> 2:15:05.480
 you're going for like triple digits.

2:15:05.480 --> 2:15:08.940
 You're going for, so like Newton is like four digits,

2:15:08.940 --> 2:15:13.400
 probably like a thousand years or personal lifetimes.

2:15:13.400 --> 2:15:15.340
 How do you like to think, well, what are we?

2:15:15.340 --> 2:15:17.480
 Sorry, I meant people times years.

2:15:17.480 --> 2:15:18.320
 People times.

2:15:18.320 --> 2:15:19.980
 So then it's like, actually his is huge.

2:15:19.980 --> 2:15:23.240
 His is like going to be billions or trillions, trillions.

2:15:23.240 --> 2:15:27.680
 But I guess for me, I actually changed the metric

2:15:27.680 --> 2:15:28.520
 after a while.

2:15:28.520 --> 2:15:30.080
 And the reason is because you may have seen,

2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:33.640
 I found some simple way to solve quadratic equations

2:15:33.640 --> 2:15:35.780
 that is easier than every textbook.

2:15:35.780 --> 2:15:39.040
 So my score might already be not bad,

2:15:39.040 --> 2:15:40.760
 which is why I decided then let's change it

2:15:40.760 --> 2:15:44.640
 into the number of hours in the lifetimes as well.

2:15:44.640 --> 2:15:48.480
 So the way I was doing it before is that

2:15:48.480 --> 2:15:53.440
 if a person was sort of remembering or using

2:15:53.440 --> 2:15:56.040
 or appreciating what I had done

2:15:56.040 --> 2:16:00.280
 for like 10 years of their life.

2:16:00.280 --> 2:16:01.120
 Oh, I see.

2:16:01.120 --> 2:16:01.940
 That would count as 10.

2:16:01.940 --> 2:16:02.780
 I see.

2:16:02.780 --> 2:16:05.060
 So if there was one person who for 10 years remembered

2:16:05.060 --> 2:16:06.200
 or appreciated something I did,

2:16:06.200 --> 2:16:09.400
 that counts as a score of 10 and we add up overall people.

2:16:09.400 --> 2:16:13.480
 And then, and that was with the hypothesis

2:16:13.480 --> 2:16:16.680
 that the score would be very finite in the sense

2:16:16.680 --> 2:16:19.080
 that if I didn't come up with anything

2:16:19.080 --> 2:16:21.400
 that might potentially help a lot of generations

2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:23.840
 in a forever way, then your score will be finite

2:16:23.840 --> 2:16:25.960
 because at some point it's not,

2:16:25.960 --> 2:16:28.760
 people don't remember that you made like nice bottles

2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:30.160
 or something, right?

2:16:30.160 --> 2:16:33.040
 But then after the quadratic equation thing,

2:16:33.040 --> 2:16:34.980
 it was that there's some chance

2:16:34.980 --> 2:16:37.720
 that that actually might make it into textbooks.

2:16:37.720 --> 2:16:39.080
 And if it makes it in textbooks,

2:16:39.080 --> 2:16:40.960
 the chance that there'll be an easier way discovered

2:16:40.960 --> 2:16:42.680
 is actually quite small.

2:16:42.680 --> 2:16:46.220
 So in that case, then the score might get bigger.

2:16:46.220 --> 2:16:48.040
 I was just saying the score might actually already

2:16:48.040 --> 2:16:51.240
 have been achieved in a non trivial way.

2:16:51.240 --> 2:16:52.080
 I see.

2:16:52.080 --> 2:16:53.720
 Because it's fun to think about,

2:16:53.720 --> 2:16:54.620
 cause it could be different.

2:16:54.620 --> 2:16:58.980
 You can achieve a high score by a small number of people

2:16:58.980 --> 2:17:01.240
 using it for most of their lifetime

2:17:01.240 --> 2:17:03.400
 and then generations and generations.

2:17:03.400 --> 2:17:05.960
 Or you can have, if we do dissipate,

2:17:05.960 --> 2:17:10.120
 if we do split colonize, become multi planetary species,

2:17:10.120 --> 2:17:12.280
 you could have that little,

2:17:12.280 --> 2:17:17.280
 a clever way to solve differential equations,

2:17:17.280 --> 2:17:19.640
 spread through like trillions of people

2:17:19.640 --> 2:17:21.600
 as they spread throughout the galaxy.

2:17:21.600 --> 2:17:24.800
 And they would only use it each one,

2:17:24.800 --> 2:17:26.760
 a few hours in their lifetime,

2:17:26.760 --> 2:17:28.280
 but their kids will use it,

2:17:28.280 --> 2:17:30.080
 the kids of kids will use it, it will spread

2:17:30.080 --> 2:17:33.240
 and you'll have that impact in that kind of way.

2:17:33.240 --> 2:17:34.920
 Yes, so that's why I renormalized it

2:17:34.920 --> 2:17:36.440
 because I was like, well, that's kind of dumb

2:17:36.440 --> 2:17:37.760
 because what's the importance of that?

2:17:37.760 --> 2:17:39.880
 That'll save people 15 minutes.

2:17:39.880 --> 2:17:42.380
 But, so what I meant is I didn't want to count that

2:17:42.380 --> 2:17:43.320
 as the main score.

2:17:46.360 --> 2:17:47.880
 Well, I'm gonna have to try to come up

2:17:47.880 --> 2:17:50.360
 with some kind of device that everyone would want to use,

2:17:50.360 --> 2:17:51.520
 maybe to make coffee,

2:17:51.520 --> 2:17:53.880
 cause coffee seems to be the prevalent

2:17:54.720 --> 2:17:57.160
 performance enhancing chemical that everyone uses.

2:17:57.160 --> 2:17:59.880
 So I'll have to think about those kinds of metrics.

2:17:59.880 --> 2:18:02.560
 Yeah, but you see that's just giving an idea

2:18:02.560 --> 2:18:05.080
 of I guess what I found meaningful in general,

2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:06.200
 like whether or not it's like,

2:18:06.200 --> 2:18:08.340
 whether or not that quadratic thing is important or not.

2:18:08.340 --> 2:18:10.740
 The general idea was I wanted to do things

2:18:10.740 --> 2:18:12.080
 that would outlast me.

2:18:12.080 --> 2:18:13.400
 And that was what inspired me

2:18:13.400 --> 2:18:15.680
 and that's just how I choose what problems to work on.

2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:18.520
 And that's a kind of immortality is ideas

2:18:18.520 --> 2:18:23.060
 that you've invented living on long after you

2:18:23.060 --> 2:18:24.920
 in the minds of others.

2:18:24.920 --> 2:18:27.160
 And humans are ultimately not,

2:18:27.160 --> 2:18:32.160
 are like meat vehicles that carry ideas for brief

2:18:32.400 --> 2:18:34.880
 for just a few years may not be the important thing.

2:18:34.880 --> 2:18:37.280
 It might be the ideas that we carry with us

2:18:37.280 --> 2:18:38.680
 and invent new ones.

2:18:38.680 --> 2:18:41.640
 Like we get a bunch of baby ideas in our head.

2:18:41.640 --> 2:18:43.120
 We borrow them from others

2:18:43.120 --> 2:18:45.060
 and then maybe we invent a new one

2:18:45.060 --> 2:18:47.920
 and that new one might have a life of its own.

2:18:47.920 --> 2:18:50.880
 And it's fun to think about that idea

2:18:50.880 --> 2:18:53.440
 of living for many centuries to come

2:18:53.440 --> 2:18:54.960
 unless we destroy ourselves.

2:18:54.960 --> 2:18:56.960
 But maybe AI will borrow it

2:18:56.960 --> 2:19:00.160
 and we'll remember Po as like that one human

2:19:00.160 --> 2:19:04.680
 that helped us out before we of course killed him

2:19:04.680 --> 2:19:06.760
 and the rest of human civilization.

2:19:06.760 --> 2:19:09.840
 On that note, Po, this is a huge honor.

2:19:09.840 --> 2:19:11.680
 You're one of the great educators

2:19:12.880 --> 2:19:15.260
 I've ever gotten a chance to interact with.

2:19:15.260 --> 2:19:18.520
 So it's truly an honor that you would talk with me today.

2:19:18.520 --> 2:19:21.160
 It means especially a lot that you would travel a lot

2:19:21.160 --> 2:19:22.480
 to Austin to talk to me.

2:19:22.480 --> 2:19:23.480
 It really means a lot.

2:19:23.480 --> 2:19:25.160
 So thank you so much.

2:19:25.160 --> 2:19:26.440
 Keep on inspiring.

2:19:26.440 --> 2:19:30.320
 And I'm one of your many, many students.

2:19:30.320 --> 2:19:32.140
 Thank you so much for talking today.

2:19:32.140 --> 2:19:32.980
 Thank you, thank you.

2:19:32.980 --> 2:19:34.640
 It's actually a real honor for me to talk to you

2:19:34.640 --> 2:19:37.120
 and to get this chance to have this really

2:19:37.120 --> 2:19:39.800
 intellectual conversation through all of these topics.

2:19:39.800 --> 2:19:41.440
 Thanks, Po.

2:19:41.440 --> 2:19:44.260
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Po Chenlo

2:19:44.260 --> 2:19:47.040
 and thank you to Jordan Harmer, the show,

2:19:47.040 --> 2:19:51.400
 Onnit, BetterHelp, AidSleep and Element.

2:19:51.400 --> 2:19:54.480
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:19:54.480 --> 2:19:58.260
 And now let me leave you with some words from Isaac Newton.

2:19:58.260 --> 2:20:01.280
 I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies

2:20:01.280 --> 2:20:03.700
 but not the madness of people.

2:20:03.700 --> 2:20:06.440
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
