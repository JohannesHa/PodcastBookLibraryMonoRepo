00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
 The following is a conversation with Matt Botmanek,

00:03.440 --> 00:06.680
 Director of Neuroscience Research at DeepMind.

00:06.680 --> 00:09.360
 He's a brilliant, cross disciplinary mind,

00:09.360 --> 00:12.480
 navigating effortlessly between cognitive psychology,

00:12.480 --> 00:16.760
 computational neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.320
 Quick summary of the ads.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.060

01:24.320 --> 01:26.120
 I've been binging on his podcast.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.400
 Jordan is a great interviewer

01:28.400 --> 01:30.280
 and even a better human being.

01:30.280 --> 01:32.760
 I recently listened to his conversation with Jack Barsky,

01:32.760 --> 01:36.120
 former sleeper agent for the KGB in the 80s

01:36.120 --> 01:38.880
 and author of Deep Undercover,

01:38.880 --> 01:40.740
 which is a memoir that paints yet another

01:40.740 --> 01:43.440
 interesting perspective on the Cold War era.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.720
 I've been reading a lot about the Stalin

01:46.720 --> 01:49.280
 and then Gorbachev and Putin eras of Russia,

01:49.280 --> 01:50.800
 but this conversation made me realize

01:50.800 --> 01:53.680
 that I need to do a deep dive into the Cold War era

01:53.680 --> 01:57.120
 to get a complete picture of Russia's recent history.

01:57.120 --> 02:01.160

02:02.880 --> 02:04.440
 It's how he knows I sent you.

02:04.440 --> 02:06.740
 It's awesome, you won't regret it.

02:06.740 --> 02:10.320
 This episode is also supported by Magic Spoon,

02:10.320 --> 02:15.320
 low carb, keto friendly, super amazingly delicious cereal.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.300
 I've been on a keto or very low carb diet

02:18.300 --> 02:19.480
 for a long time now.

02:19.480 --> 02:21.300
 It helps with my mental performance.

02:21.300 --> 02:22.840
 It helps with my physical performance,

02:22.840 --> 02:26.520
 even during this crazy push up, pull up challenge I'm doing,

02:26.520 --> 02:29.680
 including the running, it just feels great.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.320
 I used to love cereal.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.840
 Obviously, I can't have it now

02:33.840 --> 02:36.820
 because most cereals have crazy amounts of sugar,

02:36.820 --> 02:40.140
 which is terrible for you, so I quit it years ago.

02:40.140 --> 02:44.260
 But Magic Spoon, amazingly, somehow,

02:44.260 --> 02:45.920
 is a totally different thing.

02:45.920 --> 02:48.340
 Zero sugar, 11 grams of protein,

02:48.340 --> 02:50.920
 and only three net grams of carbs.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.140
 It tastes delicious.

02:53.140 --> 02:55.200
 It has a lot of flavors, two new ones,

02:55.200 --> 02:56.760
 including peanut butter.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.520
 But if you know what's good for you,

02:58.520 --> 03:01.560
 you'll go with cocoa, my favorite flavor,

03:01.560 --> 03:04.200
 and the flavor of champions.

03:13.100 --> 03:16.480
 They have agreed to sponsor this podcast for a long time.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.920
 They're an amazing sponsor and an even better cereal.

03:19.920 --> 03:21.760
 I highly recommend it.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.720
 It's delicious, it's good for you, you won't regret it.

03:24.720 --> 03:28.460
 And now, here's my conversation with Matt Botpenik.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.360
 How much of the human brain do you think we understand?

03:33.400 --> 03:36.920
 I think we're at a weird moment

03:36.920 --> 03:40.080
 in the history of neuroscience in the sense that

03:45.200 --> 03:47.320
 I feel like we understand a lot about the brain

03:47.320 --> 03:52.320
 at a very high level, but a very coarse level.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.280
 When you say high level, what are you thinking?

03:54.280 --> 03:55.440
 Are you thinking functional?

03:55.440 --> 03:56.960
 Are you thinking structurally?

03:56.960 --> 04:00.960
 So in other words, what is the brain for?

04:00.960 --> 04:03.680
 What kinds of computation does the brain do?

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
 What kinds of behaviors would we have to explain

04:12.320 --> 04:14.920
 if we were gonna look down at the mechanistic level?

04:16.560 --> 04:18.440
 And at that level, I feel like we understand

04:18.440 --> 04:19.680
 much, much more about the brain

04:19.680 --> 04:22.060
 than we did when I was in high school.

04:22.060 --> 04:25.240
 But it's almost like we're seeing it through a fog.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.600
 It's only at a very coarse level.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.200
 We don't really understand what the neuronal mechanisms are

04:30.200 --> 04:32.500
 that underlie these computations.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.600
 We've gotten better at saying,

04:34.600 --> 04:36.720
 what are the functions that the brain is computing

04:36.720 --> 04:38.400
 that we would have to understand

04:38.400 --> 04:40.200
 if we were gonna get down to the neuronal level?

04:40.200 --> 04:42.120
 And at the other end of the spectrum,

04:45.500 --> 04:49.600
 in the last few years, incredible progress has been made

04:49.600 --> 04:54.600
 in terms of technologies that allow us to see,

04:54.880 --> 04:57.220
 actually literally see, in some cases,

04:57.220 --> 05:01.040
 what's going on at the single unit level,

05:01.040 --> 05:02.640
 even the dendritic level.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.800
 And then there's this yawning gap in between.

05:05.800 --> 05:06.640
 Well, that's interesting.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.460
 So at the high level,

05:07.460 --> 05:09.600
 so that's almost a cognitive science level.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.900
 And then at the neuronal level,

05:11.900 --> 05:14.600
 that's neurobiology and neuroscience,

05:14.600 --> 05:16.040
 just studying single neurons,

05:16.040 --> 05:19.800
 the synaptic connections and all the dopamine,

05:19.800 --> 05:21.560
 all the kind of neurotransmitters.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.360
 One blanket statement I should probably make

05:23.360 --> 05:27.760
 is that as I've gotten older,

05:27.760 --> 05:30.200
 I have become more and more reluctant

05:30.200 --> 05:33.400
 to make a distinction between psychology and neuroscience.

05:33.400 --> 05:37.240
 To me, the point of neuroscience

05:37.240 --> 05:41.780
 is to study what the brain is for.

05:41.780 --> 05:44.360
 If you're a nephrologist

05:44.360 --> 05:46.560
 and you wanna learn about the kidney,

05:46.560 --> 05:50.000
 you start by saying, what is this thing for?

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
 Well, it seems to be for taking blood on one side

05:55.800 --> 06:00.260
 that has metabolites in it that shouldn't be there,

06:01.120 --> 06:03.320
 sucking them out of the blood

06:03.320 --> 06:05.160
 while leaving the good stuff behind,

06:05.160 --> 06:07.060
 and then excreting that in the form of urine.

06:07.060 --> 06:08.400
 That's what the kidney is for.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.240
 It's like obvious.

06:10.240 --> 06:13.200
 So the rest of the work is deciding how it does that.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.800
 And this, it seems to me,

06:14.800 --> 06:17.080
 is the right approach to take to the brain.

06:17.080 --> 06:19.120
 You say, well, what is the brain for?

06:19.120 --> 06:22.760
 The brain, as far as I can tell, is for producing behavior.

06:22.760 --> 06:27.020
 It's for going from perceptual inputs to behavioral outputs,

06:27.980 --> 06:30.280
 and the behavioral outputs should be adaptive.

06:31.420 --> 06:33.620
 So that's what psychology is about.

06:33.620 --> 06:35.920
 It's about understanding the structure of that function.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.920
 And then the rest of neuroscience is about figuring out

06:38.920 --> 06:41.880
 how those operations are actually carried out

06:41.880 --> 06:44.160
 at a mechanistic level.

06:44.160 --> 06:47.960
 That's really interesting, but so unlike the kidney,

06:47.960 --> 06:52.020
 the brain, the gap between the electrical signal

06:52.020 --> 06:57.020
 and behavior, so you truly see neuroscience

06:57.120 --> 07:01.220
 as the science that touches behavior,

07:01.220 --> 07:03.260
 how the brain generates behavior,

07:03.260 --> 07:07.400
 or how the brain converts raw visual information

07:07.400 --> 07:08.960
 into understanding.

07:08.960 --> 07:12.520
 Like, you basically see cognitive science,

07:12.520 --> 07:15.860
 psychology, and neuroscience as all one science.

07:15.860 --> 07:19.240
 Yeah, it's a personal statement.

07:19.240 --> 07:22.920
 Is that a hopeful or a realistic statement?

07:22.920 --> 07:26.880
 So certainly you will be correct in your feeling

07:26.880 --> 07:29.240
 in some number of years, but that number of years

07:29.240 --> 07:31.440
 could be 200, 300 years from now.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.400
 Oh, well, there's a...

07:33.400 --> 07:37.600
 Is that aspirational or is that pragmatic engineering

07:37.600 --> 07:39.360
 feeling that you have?

07:39.360 --> 07:44.360
 It's both in the sense that this is what I hope

07:46.520 --> 07:51.520
 and expect will bear fruit over the coming decades,

07:53.360 --> 07:57.560
 but it's also pragmatic in the sense that I'm not sure

07:57.560 --> 08:02.560
 what we're doing in either psychology or neuroscience

08:02.840 --> 08:04.920
 if that's not the framing.

08:04.920 --> 08:09.760
 I don't know what it means to understand the brain

08:09.760 --> 08:14.320
 if there's no, if part of the enterprise

08:14.320 --> 08:18.520
 is not about understanding the behavior

08:18.520 --> 08:20.020
 that's being produced.

08:20.020 --> 08:23.040
 I mean, yeah, but I would compare it

08:23.040 --> 08:25.880
 to maybe astronomers looking at the movement

08:25.880 --> 08:30.120
 of the planets and the stars without any interest

08:30.120 --> 08:32.360
 of the underlying physics, right?

08:32.360 --> 08:35.560
 And I would argue that at least in the early days,

08:35.560 --> 08:37.780
 there is some value to just tracing the movement

08:37.780 --> 08:41.680
 of the planets and the stars without thinking

08:41.680 --> 08:44.100
 about the physics too much because it's such a big leap

08:44.100 --> 08:45.600
 to start thinking about the physics

08:45.600 --> 08:48.640
 before you even understand even the basic structural

08:48.640 --> 08:49.520
 elements of...

08:49.520 --> 08:50.420
 Oh, I agree with that.

08:50.420 --> 08:51.260
 I agree.

08:51.260 --> 08:53.240
 But you're saying in the end, the goal should be

08:53.240 --> 08:54.760
 to deeply understand.

08:54.760 --> 08:57.300
 Well, right, and I think...

08:57.300 --> 08:59.240
 So I thought about this a lot when I was in grad school

08:59.240 --> 09:00.600
 because a lot of what I studied in grad school

09:00.600 --> 09:05.600
 was psychology and I found myself a little bit confused

09:06.120 --> 09:08.680
 about what it meant to...

09:08.680 --> 09:11.500
 It seems like what we were talking about a lot of the time

09:11.500 --> 09:14.800
 were virtual causal mechanisms.

09:14.800 --> 09:18.500
 Like, oh, well, you know, attentional selection

09:18.500 --> 09:22.200
 then selects some object in the environment

09:22.200 --> 09:25.600
 and that is then passed on to the motor, you know,

09:25.600 --> 09:27.800
 information about that is passed on to the motor system.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.760
 But these are virtual mechanisms.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.480
 These are, you know, they're metaphors.

09:31.480 --> 09:36.480
 They're, you know, there's no reduction going on

09:37.040 --> 09:40.200
 in that conversation to some physical mechanism that,

09:40.200 --> 09:43.240
 you know, which is really what it would take

09:43.240 --> 09:47.320
 to fully understand, you know, how behavior is rising.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.780
 But the causal mechanisms are definitely neurons interacting.

09:50.780 --> 09:53.360
 I'm willing to say that at this point in history.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.240
 So in psychology, at least for me personally,

09:56.240 --> 10:00.160
 there was this strange insecurity about trafficking

10:00.160 --> 10:02.680
 in these metaphors, you know,

10:02.680 --> 10:05.740
 which were supposed to explain the function of the mind.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.400
 If you can't ground them in physical mechanisms,

10:09.400 --> 10:14.400
 then what is the explanatory validity of these explanations?

10:16.120 --> 10:21.120
 And I managed to soothe my own nerves

10:21.120 --> 10:26.120
 by thinking about the history of genetics research.

10:29.400 --> 10:32.460
 So I'm very far from being an expert

10:32.460 --> 10:34.660
 on the history of this field.

10:34.660 --> 10:38.160
 But I know enough to say that, you know,

10:38.160 --> 10:42.800
 Mendelian genetics preceded, you know, Watson and Crick.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.520
 And so there was a significant period of time

10:45.520 --> 10:49.600
 during which people were, you know,

10:49.600 --> 10:54.600
 productively investigating the structure of inheritance

10:54.760 --> 10:56.880
 using what was essentially a metaphor,

10:56.880 --> 10:58.600
 the notion of a gene, you know.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.760
 Oh, genes do this and genes do that.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.520
 But, you know, where are the genes?

11:02.520 --> 11:06.080
 They're sort of an explanatory thing that we made up.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.880
 And we ascribed to them these causal properties.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.640
 Oh, there's a dominant, there's a recessive,

11:10.640 --> 11:12.800
 and then they recombine it.

11:12.800 --> 11:17.460
 And then later, there was a kind of blank there

11:17.460 --> 11:21.620
 that was filled in with a physical mechanism.

11:21.620 --> 11:22.880
 That connection was made.

11:24.300 --> 11:26.800
 But it was worth having that metaphor

11:26.800 --> 11:29.360
 because that gave us a good sense

11:29.360 --> 11:34.280
 of what kind of causal mechanism we were looking for.

11:34.280 --> 11:38.880
 And the fundamental metaphor of cognition, you said,

11:38.880 --> 11:40.780
 is the interaction of neurons.

11:40.780 --> 11:42.680
 Is that, what is the metaphor?

11:42.680 --> 11:44.280
 No, no, the metaphor,

11:44.280 --> 11:47.640
 the metaphors we use in cognitive psychology

11:47.640 --> 11:52.640
 are things like attention, the way that memory works.

11:56.040 --> 11:59.440
 I retrieve something from memory, right?

11:59.440 --> 12:01.880
 A memory retrieval occurs.

12:01.880 --> 12:02.860
 What is that?

12:02.860 --> 12:06.620
 You know, that's not a physical mechanism

12:06.620 --> 12:08.960
 that I can examine in its own right.

12:08.960 --> 12:13.840
 But it's still worth having, that metaphorical level.

12:13.840 --> 12:16.000
 Yeah, so yeah, I misunderstood actually.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.640
 So the higher level of abstractions

12:17.640 --> 12:19.640
 is the metaphor that's most useful.

12:19.640 --> 12:20.480
 Yes.

12:20.480 --> 12:24.420
 But what about, so how does that connect

12:24.420 --> 12:29.420
 to the idea that that arises from interaction of neurons?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.940
 Well, even, is the interaction of neurons

12:35.940 --> 12:38.080
 also not a metaphor to you?

12:38.080 --> 12:42.400
 Or is it literally, like that's no longer a metaphor.

12:42.400 --> 12:46.160
 That's already the lowest level of abstractions

12:46.160 --> 12:48.960
 that could actually be directly studied.

12:50.280 --> 12:53.840
 Well, I'm hesitating because I think

12:53.840 --> 12:57.000
 what I want to say could end up being controversial.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.960
 So what I want to say is, yes,

12:59.960 --> 13:03.040
 the interactions of neurons, that's not metaphorical.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.680
 That's a physical fact.

13:04.680 --> 13:08.500
 That's where the causal interactions actually occur.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.880
 Now, I suppose you could say,

13:09.880 --> 13:12.720
 well, even that is metaphorical relative

13:12.720 --> 13:14.880
 to the quantum events that underlie.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.320
 I don't want to go down that rabbit hole.

13:17.320 --> 13:18.920
 It's always turtles on top of turtles.

13:18.920 --> 13:21.200
 Yeah, there's turtles all the way down.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.560
 There's a reduction that you can do.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.640
 You can say these psychological phenomena

13:25.720 --> 13:28.200
 can be explained through a very different

13:28.200 --> 13:29.160
 kind of causal mechanism,

13:29.160 --> 13:31.440
 which has to do with neurotransmitter release.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.800
 And so what we're really trying to do

13:33.800 --> 13:37.120
 in neuroscience writ large, as I say,

13:37.120 --> 13:39.760
 which for me includes psychology,

13:39.760 --> 13:44.400
 is to take these psychological phenomena

13:44.400 --> 13:48.500
 and map them onto neural events.

13:49.980 --> 13:54.980
 I think remaining forever at the level of description

13:57.160 --> 14:00.520
 that is natural for psychology,

14:00.520 --> 14:02.280
 for me personally, would be disappointing.

14:02.280 --> 14:05.640
 I want to understand how mental activity

14:05.640 --> 14:10.360
 arises from neural activity.

14:10.360 --> 14:13.000
 But the converse is also true.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.880
 Studying neural activity without any sense

14:15.880 --> 14:18.520
 of what you're trying to explain,

14:19.800 --> 14:24.800
 to me feels like at best groping around at random.

14:27.280 --> 14:30.280
 Now, you've kind of talked about this bridging

14:30.280 --> 14:32.880
 of the gap between psychology and neuroscience,

14:32.880 --> 14:34.040
 but do you think it's possible,

14:34.040 --> 14:38.280
 like my love is, like I fell in love with psychology

14:38.280 --> 14:40.120
 and psychiatry in general with Freud

14:40.120 --> 14:41.760
 and when I was really young,

14:41.760 --> 14:43.540
 and I hoped to understand the mind.

14:43.540 --> 14:45.240
 And for me, understanding the mind,

14:45.240 --> 14:48.400
 at least at that young age before I discovered AI

14:48.400 --> 14:52.840
 and even neuroscience was to, is psychology.

14:52.840 --> 14:55.840
 And do you think it's possible to understand the mind

14:55.840 --> 14:59.920
 without getting into all the messy details of neuroscience?

14:59.920 --> 15:03.120
 Like you kind of mentioned to you it's appealing

15:03.120 --> 15:06.040
 to try to understand the mechanisms at the lowest level,

15:06.040 --> 15:07.560
 but do you think that's needed,

15:07.560 --> 15:10.200
 that's required to understand how the mind works?

15:11.480 --> 15:14.760
 That's an important part of the whole picture,

15:14.760 --> 15:18.480
 but I would be the last person on earth

15:18.480 --> 15:23.440
 to suggest that that reality

15:23.440 --> 15:27.240
 renders psychology in its own right unproductive.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.160
 I trained as a psychologist.

15:31.160 --> 15:35.000
 I am fond of saying that I have learned much more

15:35.000 --> 15:38.480
 from psychology than I have from neuroscience.

15:38.480 --> 15:43.480
 To me, psychology is a hugely important discipline.

15:43.740 --> 15:47.400
 And one thing that warms in my heart is that

15:50.360 --> 15:54.080
 ways of investigating behavior

15:54.080 --> 15:58.000
 that have been native to cognitive psychology

15:58.000 --> 16:01.600
 since it's dawn in the 60s

16:01.600 --> 16:03.960
 are starting to become,

16:03.960 --> 16:07.680
 they're starting to become interesting to AI researchers

16:07.680 --> 16:09.480
 for a variety of reasons.

16:09.480 --> 16:11.680
 And that's been exciting for me to see.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.920
 Can you maybe talk a little bit about what you see

16:14.920 --> 16:19.320
 as beautiful aspects of psychology,

16:19.320 --> 16:21.920
 maybe limiting aspects of psychology?

16:21.920 --> 16:25.640
 I mean, maybe just start it off as a science, as a field.

16:25.640 --> 16:29.760
 To me, it was when I understood what psychology is,

16:29.760 --> 16:30.880
 analytical psychology,

16:30.880 --> 16:32.760
 like the way it's actually carried out,

16:32.760 --> 16:36.240
 it was really disappointing to see two aspects.

16:36.240 --> 16:39.200
 One is how small the N is,

16:39.200 --> 16:43.040
 how small the number of subject is in the studies.

16:43.040 --> 16:45.320
 And two, it was disappointing to see

16:45.320 --> 16:47.480
 how controlled the entire,

16:47.480 --> 16:49.680
 how much it was in the lab.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.680
 It wasn't studying humans in the wild.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.000
 There was no mechanism for studying humans in the wild.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.640
 So that's where I became a little bit disillusioned

16:57.640 --> 16:59.480
 to psychology.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.680
 And then the modern world of the internet

17:01.680 --> 17:02.960
 is so exciting to me.

17:02.960 --> 17:05.720
 The Twitter data or YouTube data,

17:05.720 --> 17:08.280
 data of human behavior on the internet becomes exciting

17:08.280 --> 17:11.920
 because the N grows and then in the wild grows.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.880
 But that's just my narrow sense.

17:13.880 --> 17:16.560
 Like, do you have a optimistic or pessimistic

17:16.560 --> 17:18.160
 cynical view of psychology?

17:18.160 --> 17:19.840
 How do you see the field broadly?

17:21.120 --> 17:22.720
 When I was in graduate school,

17:22.720 --> 17:27.720
 it was early enough that there was still a thrill

17:27.800 --> 17:32.800
 in seeing that there were ways of doing,

17:32.960 --> 17:35.640
 there were ways of doing experimental science

17:36.560 --> 17:40.040
 that provided insight to the structure of the mind.

17:40.040 --> 17:43.720
 One thing that impressed me most when I was at that stage

17:43.720 --> 17:46.000
 in my education was neuropsychology,

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
 looking at, analyzing the behavior of populations

17:51.000 --> 17:55.560
 who had brain damage of different kinds

17:55.560 --> 18:00.560
 and trying to understand what the specific deficits were

18:02.920 --> 18:06.760
 that arose from a lesion in a particular part of the brain.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.960
 And the kind of experimentation that was done

18:08.960 --> 18:13.520
 and that's still being done to get answers in that context

18:13.520 --> 18:18.160
 was so creative and it was so deliberate.

18:18.160 --> 18:21.360
 It was good science.

18:21.360 --> 18:24.400
 An experiment answered one question but raised another

18:24.400 --> 18:25.600
 and somebody would do an experiment

18:25.600 --> 18:26.600
 that answered that question.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.360
 And you really felt like you were narrowing in on

18:29.360 --> 18:31.760
 some kind of approximate understanding

18:31.760 --> 18:34.840
 of what this part of the brain was for.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.880
 Do you have an example from memory

18:36.880 --> 18:39.560
 of what kind of aspects of the mind

18:39.560 --> 18:41.400
 could be studied in this kind of way?

18:41.400 --> 18:42.240
 Oh, sure.

18:42.240 --> 18:45.840
 I mean, the very detailed neuropsychological studies

18:45.840 --> 18:49.720
 of language function,

18:49.720 --> 18:52.040
 looking at production and reception

18:52.040 --> 18:57.080
 and the relationship between visual function,

18:57.080 --> 19:00.680
 reading and auditory and semantic.

19:00.680 --> 19:03.920
 There were these, and still are, these beautiful models

19:03.920 --> 19:05.560
 that came out of that kind of research

19:05.560 --> 19:08.480
 that really made you feel like you understood something

19:08.480 --> 19:10.320
 that you hadn't understood before

19:10.320 --> 19:15.320
 about how language processing is organized in the brain.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.280
 But having said all that,

19:20.840 --> 19:25.400
 I think you are, I mean, I agree with you

19:25.400 --> 19:30.400
 that the cost of doing highly controlled experiments

19:30.960 --> 19:35.960
 is that you, by construction, miss out on the richness

19:36.480 --> 19:39.160
 and complexity of the real world.

19:39.160 --> 19:42.360
 One thing that, so I was drawn into science

19:42.360 --> 19:44.960
 by what in those days was called connectionism,

19:44.960 --> 19:49.120
 which is, of course, what we now call deep learning.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.840
 And at that point in history,

19:50.840 --> 19:54.200
 neural networks were primarily being used

19:54.200 --> 19:56.440
 in order to model human cognition.

19:56.440 --> 20:00.200
 They weren't yet really useful for industrial applications.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.080
 So you always found neural networks

20:02.080 --> 20:04.080
 in biological form beautiful.

20:04.080 --> 20:07.160
 Oh, neural networks were very concretely the thing

20:07.160 --> 20:09.160
 that drew me into science.

20:09.160 --> 20:13.320
 I was handed, are you familiar with the PDP books

20:13.320 --> 20:15.720
 from the 80s when I was in,

20:15.720 --> 20:18.240
 I went to medical school before I went into science.

20:18.240 --> 20:19.160
 And, yeah.

20:19.160 --> 20:20.800
 Really, interesting.

20:20.800 --> 20:21.960
 Wow.

20:21.960 --> 20:23.920
 I also did a graduate degree in art history,

20:23.920 --> 20:26.480
 so I'm kind of exploring.

20:26.480 --> 20:28.560
 Well, art history, I understand.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.280
 That's just a curious, creative mind.

20:31.280 --> 20:33.960
 But medical school, with the dream of what,

20:33.960 --> 20:36.560
 if we take that slight tangent?

20:36.560 --> 20:39.120
 What, did you want to be a surgeon?

20:39.120 --> 20:41.680
 I actually was quite interested in surgery.

20:41.680 --> 20:44.200
 I was interested in surgery and psychiatry.

20:44.200 --> 20:49.200
 And I thought, I must be the only person on the planet

20:49.520 --> 20:52.680
 who was torn between those two fields.

20:52.680 --> 20:56.840
 And I said exactly that to my advisor in medical school,

20:56.840 --> 20:59.440
 who turned out, I found out later,

20:59.440 --> 21:01.920
 to be a famous psychoanalyst.

21:01.920 --> 21:05.160
 And he said to me, no, no, it's actually not so uncommon

21:05.160 --> 21:07.520
 to be interested in surgery and psychiatry.

21:07.520 --> 21:10.480
 And he conjectured that the reason

21:10.480 --> 21:12.600
 that people develop these two interests

21:12.600 --> 21:15.480
 is that both fields are about going beneath the surface

21:16.360 --> 21:19.120
 and kind of getting into the kind of secret.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.040
 I mean, maybe you understand this as someone

21:21.040 --> 21:23.440
 who was interested in psychoanalysis.

21:23.440 --> 21:26.200
 There's sort of a, there's a cliche phrase

21:26.200 --> 21:28.400
 that people use now, like in NPR,

21:28.400 --> 21:31.400
 the secret life of blankety blank, right?

21:31.400 --> 21:33.560
 And that was part of the thrill of surgery,

21:33.560 --> 21:38.120
 was seeing the secret activity

21:38.120 --> 21:40.560
 that's inside everybody's abdomen and thorax.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.880
 That's a very poetic way to connect it to disciplines

21:43.880 --> 21:45.560
 that are very, practically speaking,

21:45.560 --> 21:46.520
 different from each other.

21:46.520 --> 21:48.480
 That's for sure, that's for sure, yes.

21:48.480 --> 21:52.480
 So how did we get onto medical school?

21:52.480 --> 21:53.720
 So I was in medical school

21:53.720 --> 21:57.360
 and I was doing a psychiatry rotation

21:57.360 --> 22:01.000
 and my kind of advisor in that rotation

22:02.280 --> 22:04.720
 asked me what I was interested in.

22:04.720 --> 22:07.800
 And I said, well, maybe psychiatry.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.280
 He said, why?

22:09.280 --> 22:11.120
 And I said, well, I've always been interested

22:11.120 --> 22:13.080
 in how the brain works.

22:13.080 --> 22:16.160
 I'm pretty sure that nobody's doing scientific research

22:16.160 --> 22:19.160
 that addresses my interests,

22:19.160 --> 22:21.880
 which are, I didn't have a word for it then,

22:21.880 --> 22:25.200
 but I would have said about cognition.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.680
 And he said, well, you know, I'm not sure that's true.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.600
 You might be interested in these books.

22:29.600 --> 22:32.440
 And he pulled down the PDB books from his shelf

22:32.440 --> 22:33.960
 and they were still shrink wrapped.

22:33.960 --> 22:36.920
 He hadn't read them, but he handed them to me.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.680
 He said, you feel free to borrow these.

22:38.680 --> 22:41.440
 And that was, you know, I went back to my dorm room

22:41.440 --> 22:43.400
 and I just, you know, read them cover to cover.

22:43.400 --> 22:44.960
 And what's PDB?

22:44.960 --> 22:46.520
 Parallel distributed processing,

22:46.520 --> 22:50.840
 which was one of the original names for deep learning.

22:50.840 --> 22:55.000
 And so I apologize for the romanticized question,

22:55.000 --> 22:58.360
 but what idea in the space of neuroscience

22:58.360 --> 23:00.840
 and the space of the human brain is to you

23:00.840 --> 23:03.880
 the most beautiful, mysterious, surprising?

23:03.880 --> 23:07.160
 What had always fascinated me,

23:08.480 --> 23:11.440
 even when I was a pretty young kid, I think,

23:12.320 --> 23:17.320
 was the paradox that lies in the fact

23:21.360 --> 23:25.640
 that the brain is so mysterious

23:25.640 --> 23:28.200
 and seems so distant.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.520
 But at the same time,

23:32.520 --> 23:37.360
 it's responsible for the full transparency

23:37.360 --> 23:39.040
 of everyday life.

23:39.040 --> 23:41.520
 The brain is literally what makes everything obvious

23:41.520 --> 23:43.080
 and familiar.

23:43.080 --> 23:47.280
 And there's always one in the room with you.

23:47.280 --> 23:48.120
 Yeah.

23:48.120 --> 23:50.520
 I used to teach, when I taught at Princeton,

23:50.520 --> 23:53.000
 I used to teach a cognitive neuroscience course.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.720
 And the very last thing I would say to the students was,

23:56.720 --> 24:00.160
 you know, people often,

24:00.160 --> 24:04.200
 when people think of scientific inspiration,

24:04.200 --> 24:08.120
 the metaphor is often, well, look to the stars.

24:08.120 --> 24:12.360
 The stars will inspire you to wonder at the universe

24:12.360 --> 24:15.800
 and think about your place in it and how things work.

24:15.800 --> 24:18.360
 And I'm all for looking at the stars,

24:18.360 --> 24:21.600
 but I've always been much more inspired.

24:21.600 --> 24:25.360
 And my sense of wonder comes from the,

24:25.360 --> 24:28.560
 not from the distant, mysterious stars,

24:28.560 --> 24:33.560
 but from the extremely intimately close brain.

24:34.440 --> 24:35.280
 Yeah.

24:35.280 --> 24:38.680
 There's something just endlessly fascinating

24:38.680 --> 24:40.000
 to me about that.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.360
 The, like, just like you said,

24:41.360 --> 24:45.500
 the one that's close and yet distant

24:45.500 --> 24:48.000
 in terms of our understanding of it.

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
 Do you, are you also captivated by the fact

24:53.640 --> 24:56.040
 that this very conversation is happening

24:56.040 --> 24:57.560
 because two brains are communicating so that?

24:57.560 --> 24:59.120
 Yes, exactly.

24:59.120 --> 25:03.800
 The, I guess what I mean is the subjective nature

25:03.800 --> 25:06.320
 of the experience, if it can take a small attention

25:06.320 --> 25:10.240
 into the mystical of it, the consciousness,

25:10.240 --> 25:13.320
 or when you were saying you're captivated

25:13.320 --> 25:14.920
 by the idea of the brain,

25:14.920 --> 25:16.320
 are you talking about specifically

25:16.320 --> 25:18.200
 the mechanism of cognition?

25:18.200 --> 25:23.080
 Or are you also just, like, at least for me,

25:23.080 --> 25:26.600
 it's almost like paralyzing the beauty and the mystery

25:26.600 --> 25:29.480
 of the fact that it creates the entirety of the experience,

25:29.480 --> 25:32.880
 not just the reasoning capability, but the experience.

25:32.880 --> 25:37.880
 Well, I definitely resonate with that latter thought.

25:38.920 --> 25:43.920
 And I often find discussions of artificial intelligence

25:45.280 --> 25:49.120
 to be disappointingly narrow.

25:50.720 --> 25:55.720
 Speaking as someone who has always had an interest in art.

25:55.720 --> 25:56.560
 Right.

25:56.560 --> 25:57.400
 I was just gonna go there

25:57.400 --> 26:00.200
 because it sounds like somebody who has an interest in art.

26:00.200 --> 26:04.000
 Yeah, I mean, there are many layers

26:04.000 --> 26:08.200
 to full bore human experience.

26:08.200 --> 26:12.040
 And in some ways it's not enough to say,

26:12.040 --> 26:15.020
 oh, well, don't worry, we're talking about cognition,

26:15.020 --> 26:17.240
 but we'll add emotion, you know?

26:17.240 --> 26:21.200
 There's an incredible scope

26:21.200 --> 26:25.280
 to what humans go through in every moment.

26:25.280 --> 26:30.280
 And yes, so that's part of what fascinates me,

26:33.320 --> 26:37.320
 is that our brains are producing that.

26:40.040 --> 26:43.040
 But at the same time, it's so mysterious to us.

26:43.040 --> 26:43.880
 How?

26:46.240 --> 26:49.120
 Our brains are literally in our heads

26:49.120 --> 26:50.600
 producing this experience.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.120
 Producing the experience.

26:52.120 --> 26:55.100
 And yet it's so mysterious to us.

26:55.100 --> 26:57.000
 And so, and the scientific challenge

26:57.000 --> 27:00.880
 of getting at the actual explanation for that

27:00.880 --> 27:03.360
 is so overwhelming.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.600
 That's just, I don't know.

27:05.600 --> 27:08.440
 Certain people have fixations on particular questions

27:08.440 --> 27:11.680
 and that's always, that's just always been mine.

27:11.680 --> 27:14.020
 Yeah, I would say the poetry of that is fascinating.

27:14.020 --> 27:16.740
 And I'm really interested in natural language as well.

27:16.740 --> 27:19.440
 And when you look at artificial intelligence community,

27:19.440 --> 27:23.880
 it always saddens me how much

27:23.880 --> 27:25.720
 when you try to create a benchmark

27:25.720 --> 27:28.200
 for the community to gather around,

27:28.200 --> 27:30.920
 how much of the magic of language is lost

27:30.920 --> 27:33.240
 when you create that benchmark.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.920
 That there's something, we talk about experience,

27:35.920 --> 27:38.600
 the music of the language, the wit,

27:38.600 --> 27:41.080
 the something that makes a rich experience,

27:41.080 --> 27:43.800
 something that would be required to pass

27:43.800 --> 27:47.660
 the spirit of the Turing test is lost in these benchmarks.

27:47.660 --> 27:50.240
 And I wonder how to get it back in

27:50.240 --> 27:51.920
 because it's very difficult.

27:51.920 --> 27:55.160
 The moment you try to do like real good rigorous science,

27:55.160 --> 27:56.960
 you lose some of that magic.

27:56.960 --> 28:00.160
 When you try to study cognition

28:00.160 --> 28:01.560
 in a rigorous scientific way,

28:01.560 --> 28:03.800
 it feels like you're losing some of the magic.

28:03.800 --> 28:07.520
 The seeing cognition in a mechanistic way

28:07.520 --> 28:10.060
 that AI folk at this stage in our history.

28:10.060 --> 28:13.040
 Well, I agree with you, but at the same time,

28:13.040 --> 28:18.040
 one thing that I found really exciting

28:18.040 --> 28:22.960
 about that first wave of deep learning models in cognition

28:22.960 --> 28:27.960
 was the fact that the people who were building these models

28:29.640 --> 28:32.960
 were focused on the richness and complexity

28:32.960 --> 28:34.800
 of human cognition.

28:34.800 --> 28:39.800
 So an early debate in cognitive science,

28:40.080 --> 28:41.820
 which I sort of witnessed as a grad student

28:41.820 --> 28:44.200
 was about something that sounds very dry,

28:44.200 --> 28:47.180
 which is the formation of the past tense.

28:47.180 --> 28:49.200
 But there were these two camps.

28:49.200 --> 28:54.200
 One said, well, the mind encodes certain rules

28:54.400 --> 28:57.900
 and it also has a list of exceptions

28:57.900 --> 29:00.380
 because of course, the rule is add ED,

29:00.380 --> 29:01.820
 but that's not always what you do.

29:01.820 --> 29:03.720
 So you have to have a list of exceptions.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.960
 And then there were the connectionists

29:06.960 --> 29:10.700
 who evolved into the deep learning people who said,

29:10.700 --> 29:13.820
 well, if you look carefully at the data,

29:13.820 --> 29:18.280
 if you actually look at corpora, like language corpora,

29:18.280 --> 29:20.080
 it turns out to be very rich

29:20.080 --> 29:25.080
 because yes, there are most verbs

29:25.080 --> 29:28.640
 that you just tack on ED, and then there are exceptions,

29:28.640 --> 29:33.640
 but there are rules that the exceptions aren't just random.

29:36.040 --> 29:39.560
 There are certain clues to which verbs

29:39.560 --> 29:41.040
 should be exceptional.

29:41.040 --> 29:44.120
 And then there are exceptions to the exceptions.

29:44.120 --> 29:47.760
 And there was a word that was kind of deployed

29:47.760 --> 29:51.760
 in order to capture this, which was quasi regular.

29:51.760 --> 29:54.740
 In other words, there are rules, but it's messy.

29:54.740 --> 29:58.760
 And there's either structure even among the exceptions.

29:58.760 --> 30:01.280
 And it would be, yeah, you could try to write down,

30:01.280 --> 30:03.820
 we could try to write down the structure

30:03.820 --> 30:04.840
 in some sort of closed form,

30:04.840 --> 30:07.560
 but really the right way to understand

30:07.560 --> 30:09.080
 how the brain is handling all this,

30:09.080 --> 30:11.440
 and by the way, producing all of this,

30:11.440 --> 30:14.000
 is to build a deep neural network

30:14.000 --> 30:15.200
 and train it on this data

30:15.200 --> 30:18.520
 and see how it ends up representing all of this richness.

30:18.520 --> 30:21.420
 So the way that deep learning

30:21.420 --> 30:23.720
 was deployed in cognitive psychology

30:23.720 --> 30:25.960
 was that was the spirit of it.

30:25.960 --> 30:28.080
 It was about that richness.

30:29.560 --> 30:31.960
 And that's something that I always found very compelling,

30:31.960 --> 30:33.160
 still do.

30:33.160 --> 30:36.200
 Is there something especially interesting

30:36.200 --> 30:37.520
 and profound to you

30:37.520 --> 30:40.480
 in terms of our current deep learning neural network,

30:40.480 --> 30:42.640
 artificial neural network approaches,

30:42.640 --> 30:46.300
 and whatever we do understand

30:46.300 --> 30:49.000
 about the biological neural networks in our brain?

30:49.000 --> 30:52.440
 Is there, there's quite a few differences.

30:52.440 --> 30:54.680
 Are some of them to you,

30:54.680 --> 30:58.040
 either interesting or perhaps profound

30:58.040 --> 31:03.040
 in terms of the gap we might want to try to close

31:03.040 --> 31:07.560
 in trying to create a human level intelligence?

31:07.560 --> 31:08.840
 What I would say here is something

31:08.840 --> 31:10.720
 that a lot of people are saying,

31:10.720 --> 31:15.720
 which is that one seeming limitation

31:16.580 --> 31:18.960
 of the systems that we're building now

31:18.960 --> 31:21.860
 is that they lack the kind of flexibility,

31:22.900 --> 31:25.960
 the readiness to sort of turn on a dime

31:25.960 --> 31:28.200
 when the context calls for it

31:28.200 --> 31:32.200
 that is so characteristic of human behavior.

31:32.200 --> 31:34.920
 So is that connected to you to the,

31:34.920 --> 31:37.720
 like which aspect of the neural networks in our brain

31:37.720 --> 31:39.160
 is that connected to?

31:39.160 --> 31:42.660
 Is that closer to the cognitive science level of,

31:45.080 --> 31:47.320
 now again, see like my natural inclination

31:47.320 --> 31:51.640
 is to separate into three disciplines of neuroscience,

31:51.640 --> 31:54.280
 cognitive science and psychology.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.380
 And you've already kind of shut that down

31:56.380 --> 31:58.360
 by saying you're kind of see them as separate,

31:58.360 --> 32:01.500
 but just to look at those layers,

32:01.500 --> 32:05.320
 I guess where is there something about the lowest layer

32:05.320 --> 32:09.160
 of the way the neural neurons interact

32:09.160 --> 32:13.320
 that is profound to you in terms of this difference

32:13.320 --> 32:15.480
 to the artificial neural networks,

32:15.480 --> 32:17.220
 or is all the key differences

32:17.220 --> 32:19.240
 at a higher level of abstraction?

32:20.720 --> 32:22.720
 One thing I often think about is that,

32:24.440 --> 32:27.140
 if you take an introductory computer science course

32:27.140 --> 32:29.600
 and they are introducing you to the notion

32:29.600 --> 32:31.480
 of Turing machines,

32:31.480 --> 32:36.000
 one way of articulating

32:36.000 --> 32:39.320
 what the significance of a Turing machine is,

32:39.320 --> 32:41.620
 is that it's a machine emulator.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.320
 It can emulate any other machine.

32:47.540 --> 32:50.480
 And that to me,

32:52.960 --> 32:54.920
 that way of looking at a Turing machine

32:56.200 --> 32:57.640
 really sticks with me.

32:57.640 --> 33:01.960
 I think of humans as maybe sharing

33:01.960 --> 33:05.000
 in some of that character.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.160
 We're capacity limited,

33:06.160 --> 33:07.540
 we're not Turing machines obviously,

33:07.540 --> 33:11.040
 but we have the ability to adapt behaviors

33:11.040 --> 33:15.420
 that are very much unlike anything we've done before,

33:15.420 --> 33:17.720
 but there's some basic mechanism

33:17.720 --> 33:18.960
 that's implemented in our brain

33:18.960 --> 33:22.400
 that allows us to run software.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.600
 But just on that point, you mentioned Turing machine,

33:24.600 --> 33:26.840
 but nevertheless, it's fundamentally

33:26.840 --> 33:29.720
 our brains are just computational devices in your view.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.160
 Is that what you're getting at?

33:31.160 --> 33:35.680
 It was a little bit unclear to this line you drew.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.800
 Is there any magic in there

33:37.800 --> 33:40.720
 or is it just basic computation?

33:40.720 --> 33:43.320
 I'm happy to think of it as just basic computation,

33:43.320 --> 33:46.120
 but mind you, I won't be satisfied

33:46.120 --> 33:48.280
 until somebody explains to me

33:48.280 --> 33:49.840
 what the basic computations are

33:49.840 --> 33:53.760
 that are leading to the full richness of human cognition.

33:54.760 --> 33:56.680
 It's not gonna be enough for me

33:56.680 --> 33:58.880
 to understand what the computations are

33:58.880 --> 34:02.160
 that allow people to do arithmetic or play chess.

34:02.160 --> 34:06.360
 I want the whole thing.

34:06.360 --> 34:07.780
 And a small tangent,

34:07.780 --> 34:10.480
 because you kind of mentioned coronavirus,

34:10.480 --> 34:12.400
 there's group behavior.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.480
 Oh, sure.

34:13.480 --> 34:14.960
 Is there something interesting

34:14.960 --> 34:17.680
 to your search of understanding the human mind

34:18.720 --> 34:21.520
 where behavior of large groups

34:21.520 --> 34:24.240
 or just behavior of groups is interesting,

34:24.240 --> 34:25.640
 seeing that as a collective mind,

34:25.640 --> 34:27.120
 as a collective intelligence,

34:27.120 --> 34:28.880
 perhaps seeing the groups of people

34:28.880 --> 34:31.080
 as a single intelligent organisms,

34:31.080 --> 34:34.200
 especially looking at the reinforcement learning work

34:34.200 --> 34:35.600
 you've done recently.

34:35.600 --> 34:36.920
 Well, yeah, I can't.

34:36.920 --> 34:41.760
 I mean, I have the honor of working

34:41.760 --> 34:43.640
 with a lot of incredibly smart people

34:43.640 --> 34:45.480
 and I wouldn't wanna take any credit

34:45.480 --> 34:48.820
 for leading the way on the multiagent work

34:48.820 --> 34:51.360
 that's come out of my group or DeepMind lately,

34:51.360 --> 34:53.840
 but I do find it fascinating.

34:53.840 --> 34:58.840
 And I mean, I think it can't be debated.

35:00.760 --> 35:05.760
 You know, human behavior arises within communities.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.960
 That just seems to me self evident.

35:08.960 --> 35:11.400
 But to me, it is self evident,

35:11.400 --> 35:14.720
 but that seems to be a profound aspects

35:14.720 --> 35:16.040
 of something that created.

35:16.040 --> 35:19.160
 That was like, if you look at like 2001 Space Odyssey

35:19.160 --> 35:21.360
 when the monkeys touched the...

35:21.360 --> 35:22.200
 Yeah.

35:22.200 --> 35:25.320
 That's the magical moment I think Yuval Harari argues

35:25.320 --> 35:29.400
 that the ability of our large numbers of humans

35:29.400 --> 35:31.880
 to hold an idea, to converge towards idea together,

35:31.880 --> 35:34.360
 like you said, shaking hands versus bumping elbows,

35:34.360 --> 35:39.360
 somehow converge without being in a room altogether,

35:40.880 --> 35:43.380
 just kind of this like distributed convergence

35:43.380 --> 35:46.720
 towards an idea over a particular period of time

35:46.720 --> 35:51.520
 seems to be fundamental to just every aspect

35:51.520 --> 35:53.400
 of our cognition, of our intelligence,

35:53.400 --> 35:56.720
 because humans, I will talk about reward,

35:56.720 --> 35:58.720
 but it seems like we don't really have

35:58.720 --> 36:01.320
 a clear objective function under which we operate,

36:01.320 --> 36:04.160
 but we all kind of converge towards one somehow.

36:04.160 --> 36:06.740
 And that to me has always been a mystery

36:07.600 --> 36:09.840
 that I think is somehow productive

36:09.840 --> 36:13.620
 for also understanding AI systems.

36:13.620 --> 36:16.520
 But I guess that's the next step.

36:16.520 --> 36:18.780
 The first step is try to understand the mind.

36:18.780 --> 36:19.700
 Well, I don't know.

36:19.700 --> 36:22.520
 I mean, I think there's something to the argument

36:22.520 --> 36:27.520
 that that kind of like strictly bottom up approach

36:27.520 --> 36:29.920
 is wrongheaded.

36:29.920 --> 36:33.920
 In other words, there are basic phenomena,

36:34.880 --> 36:36.860
 basic aspects of human intelligence

36:36.860 --> 36:41.860
 that can only be understood in the context of groups.

36:43.280 --> 36:44.680
 I'm perfectly open to that.

36:44.680 --> 36:48.680
 I've never been particularly convinced by the notion

36:48.680 --> 36:52.360
 that we should consider intelligence

36:52.360 --> 36:55.600
 to inhere at the level of communities.

36:55.600 --> 36:58.720
 I don't know why, I'm sort of stuck on the notion

36:58.720 --> 37:01.380
 that the basic unit that we want to understand

37:01.380 --> 37:02.720
 is individual humans.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.880
 And if we have to understand that

37:05.880 --> 37:07.680
 in the context of other humans, fine.

37:08.560 --> 37:11.320
 But for me, intelligence is just,

37:11.320 --> 37:14.640
 I stubbornly define it as something

37:14.640 --> 37:18.800
 that is an aspect of an individual human.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.200
 That's just my, I don't know if that's a matter of taste.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.880
 I'm with you, but that could be the reductionist dream

37:22.880 --> 37:26.400
 of a scientist because you can understand a single human.

37:26.400 --> 37:30.760
 It also is very possible that intelligence can only arise

37:30.760 --> 37:33.040
 when there's multiple intelligences.

37:33.040 --> 37:37.480
 When there's multiple sort of, it's a sad thing,

37:37.480 --> 37:39.880
 if that's true, because it's very difficult to study.

37:39.880 --> 37:42.440
 But if it's just one human,

37:42.440 --> 37:44.880
 that one human would not be homosapien,

37:44.880 --> 37:46.520
 would not become that intelligent.

37:46.520 --> 37:48.500
 That's a possibility.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.040
 I'm with you.

37:50.040 --> 37:52.800
 One thing I will say along these lines

37:52.800 --> 37:57.800
 is that I think a serious effort

38:01.280 --> 38:03.440
 to understand human intelligence

38:05.600 --> 38:09.680
 and maybe to build humanlike intelligence

38:09.680 --> 38:11.840
 needs to pay just as much attention

38:11.840 --> 38:14.000
 to the structure of the environment

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
 as to the structure of the cognizing system,

38:20.040 --> 38:22.180
 whether it's a brain or an AI system.

38:23.260 --> 38:24.640
 That's one thing I took away actually

38:24.640 --> 38:27.920
 from my early studies with the pioneers

38:27.920 --> 38:29.900
 of neural network research,

38:29.900 --> 38:32.240
 people like Jay McClelland and John Cohen.

38:34.080 --> 38:38.600
 The structure of cognition is really,

38:38.600 --> 38:43.600
 it's only partly a function of the architecture of the brain

38:44.480 --> 38:46.980
 and the learning algorithms that it implements.

38:46.980 --> 38:51.520
 What really shapes it is the interaction of those things

38:51.520 --> 38:54.460
 with the structure of the world

38:54.460 --> 38:56.680
 in which those things are embedded.

38:56.680 --> 38:58.280
 And that's especially important for,

38:58.280 --> 39:00.880
 that's made most clear in reinforcement learning

39:00.880 --> 39:03.720
 where the simulated environment is,

39:03.720 --> 39:05.800
 you can only learn as much as you can simulate.

39:05.800 --> 39:09.360
 And that's what DeepMind made very clear

39:09.360 --> 39:11.080
 with the other aspect of the environment,

39:11.080 --> 39:15.600
 which is the self play mechanism of the other agent,

39:15.600 --> 39:16.840
 of the competitive behavior,

39:16.840 --> 39:20.000
 which the other agent becomes the environment essentially.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.080
 And that's, I mean, one of the most exciting ideas in AI

39:24.080 --> 39:27.960
 is the self play mechanism that's able to learn successfully.

39:27.960 --> 39:28.800
 So there you go.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.600
 There's a thing where competition is essential

39:31.600 --> 39:35.040
 for learning, at least in that context.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.960
 So if we can step back into another sort of beautiful world,

39:37.960 --> 39:42.040
 which is the actual mechanics,

39:42.040 --> 39:44.680
 the dirty mess of it of the human brain,

39:44.680 --> 39:48.520
 is there something for people who might not know?

39:49.440 --> 39:51.120
 Is there something you can comment on

39:51.120 --> 39:53.960
 or describe the key parts of the brain

39:53.960 --> 39:56.840
 that are important for intelligence or just in general,

39:56.840 --> 39:58.620
 what are the different parts of the brain

39:58.620 --> 40:01.120
 that you're curious about that you've studied

40:01.120 --> 40:03.880
 and that are just good to know about

40:03.880 --> 40:06.240
 when you're thinking about cognition?

40:06.240 --> 40:11.200
 Well, my area of expertise, if I have one,

40:11.200 --> 40:14.200
 is prefrontal cortex.

40:14.200 --> 40:16.560
 So, you know. What's that?

40:16.560 --> 40:18.200
 Where do we?

40:18.200 --> 40:19.520
 It depends on who you ask.

40:21.520 --> 40:25.640
 The technical definition is anatomical.

40:25.640 --> 40:30.640
 There are parts of your brain

40:30.680 --> 40:32.480
 that are responsible for motor behavior

40:32.480 --> 40:34.620
 and they're very easy to identify.

40:35.740 --> 40:40.740
 And the region of your cerebral cortex,

40:40.760 --> 40:43.960
 the sort of outer crust of your brain

40:43.960 --> 40:46.440
 that lies in front of those

40:46.440 --> 40:49.360
 is defined as the prefrontal cortex.

40:49.360 --> 40:51.960
 And when you say anatomical, sorry to interrupt,

40:51.960 --> 40:56.960
 so that's referring to sort of the geographic region

40:57.160 --> 41:00.160
 as opposed to some kind of functional definition.

41:00.160 --> 41:04.400
 Exactly, so this is kind of the coward's way out.

41:04.400 --> 41:06.000
 I'm telling you what the prefrontal cortex is

41:06.000 --> 41:09.640
 just in terms of what part of the real estate it occupies.

41:09.640 --> 41:10.720
 It's the thing in the front of the brain.

41:10.720 --> 41:11.680
 Yeah, exactly.

41:11.680 --> 41:14.960
 And in fact, the early history

41:14.960 --> 41:19.960
 of neuroscientific investigation

41:20.840 --> 41:23.480
 of what this front part of the brain does

41:23.480 --> 41:25.760
 is sort of funny to read

41:25.760 --> 41:30.760
 because it was really World War I

41:32.280 --> 41:34.580
 that started people down this road

41:34.580 --> 41:37.280
 of trying to figure out what different parts of the brain,

41:37.280 --> 41:39.440
 the human brain do in the sense

41:39.440 --> 41:42.560
 that there were a lot of people with brain damage

41:42.560 --> 41:44.800
 who came back from the war with brain damage.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.740
 And that provided, as tragic as that was,

41:47.740 --> 41:49.900
 it provided an opportunity for scientists

41:49.900 --> 41:53.440
 to try to identify the functions of different brain regions.

41:53.440 --> 41:56.200
 And that was actually incredibly productive,

41:56.200 --> 41:59.480
 but one of the frustrations that neuropsychologists faced

41:59.480 --> 42:02.160
 was they couldn't really identify exactly

42:02.160 --> 42:05.040
 what the deficit was that arose from damage

42:05.040 --> 42:08.440
 to these most kind of frontal parts of the brain.

42:08.440 --> 42:13.440
 It was just a very difficult thing to pin down.

42:13.680 --> 42:16.080
 There were a couple of neuropsychologists

42:16.080 --> 42:20.600
 who identified through a large amount

42:20.600 --> 42:23.000
 of clinical experience and close observation,

42:23.000 --> 42:26.240
 they started to put their finger on a syndrome

42:26.240 --> 42:27.680
 that was associated with frontal damage.

42:27.680 --> 42:30.480
 Actually, one of them was a Russian neuropsychologist

42:30.480 --> 42:35.120
 named Luria, who students of cognitive psychology still read.

42:36.160 --> 42:41.160
 And what he started to figure out was that

42:41.360 --> 42:45.600
 the frontal cortex was somehow involved in flexibility,

42:48.060 --> 42:52.320
 in guiding behaviors that required someone

42:52.320 --> 42:57.320
 to override a habit, or to do something unusual,

42:57.600 --> 43:01.040
 or to change what they were doing in a very flexible way

43:01.040 --> 43:02.560
 from one moment to another.

43:02.560 --> 43:05.080
 So focused on like new experiences.

43:05.080 --> 43:08.800
 And so the way your brain processes

43:08.800 --> 43:10.960
 and acts in new experiences.

43:10.960 --> 43:14.760
 Yeah, what later helped bring this function

43:14.760 --> 43:17.240
 into better focus was a distinction

43:17.240 --> 43:19.880
 between controlled and automatic behavior,

43:19.880 --> 43:23.680
 or in other literatures, this is referred to

43:23.680 --> 43:28.280
 as habitual behavior versus goal directed behavior.

43:28.280 --> 43:33.280
 So it's very, very clear that the human brain

43:33.440 --> 43:36.600
 has pathways that are dedicated to habits,

43:36.600 --> 43:39.360
 to things that you do all the time,

43:39.360 --> 43:42.440
 and they need to be automatized

43:42.440 --> 43:45.140
 so that they don't require you to concentrate too much.

43:45.140 --> 43:47.840
 So that leaves your cognitive capacity

43:47.840 --> 43:49.800
 free to do other things.

43:49.800 --> 43:51.640
 Just think about the difference

43:51.640 --> 43:55.960
 between driving when you're learning to drive

43:55.960 --> 43:59.160
 versus driving after you're a fairly expert.

43:59.160 --> 44:03.560
 There are brain pathways that slowly absorb

44:03.560 --> 44:07.840
 those frequently performed behaviors

44:07.840 --> 44:12.360
 so that they can be habits, so that they can be automatic.

44:12.360 --> 44:14.900
 That's kind of like the purest form of learning.

44:14.900 --> 44:18.360
 I guess it's happening there, which is why,

44:18.360 --> 44:20.000
 I mean, this is kind of jumping ahead,

44:20.000 --> 44:22.480
 which is why that perhaps is the most useful for us

44:22.480 --> 44:24.080
 to focusing on and trying to see

44:24.080 --> 44:27.340
 how artificial intelligence systems can learn.

44:27.340 --> 44:28.180
 Is that the way you think?

44:28.180 --> 44:29.000
 It's interesting.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.040
 I do think about this distinction

44:30.040 --> 44:31.440
 between controlled and automatic,

44:31.440 --> 44:34.600
 or goal directed and habitual behavior a lot

44:34.600 --> 44:38.640
 in thinking about where we are in AI research.

44:42.960 --> 44:46.480
 But just to finish the kind of dissertation here,

44:46.480 --> 44:51.380
 the role of the prefrontal cortex

44:51.380 --> 44:54.600
 is generally understood these days

44:54.600 --> 44:59.600
 sort of in contradistinction to that habitual domain.

45:00.440 --> 45:02.320
 In other words, the prefrontal cortex

45:02.320 --> 45:05.840
 is what helps you override those habits.

45:05.840 --> 45:07.440
 It's what allows you to say,

45:07.440 --> 45:10.800
 well, what I usually do in this situation is X,

45:10.800 --> 45:14.160
 but given the context, I probably should do Y.

45:14.160 --> 45:18.080
 I mean, the elbow bump is a great example, right?

45:18.080 --> 45:19.300
 Reaching out and shaking hands

45:19.300 --> 45:22.520
 is probably a habitual behavior,

45:22.520 --> 45:26.000
 and it's the prefrontal cortex that allows us

45:26.000 --> 45:28.760
 to bear in mind that there's something unusual

45:28.760 --> 45:31.360
 going on right now, and in this situation,

45:31.360 --> 45:33.480
 I need to not do the usual thing.

45:34.720 --> 45:38.560
 The kind of behaviors that Luria reported,

45:38.560 --> 45:42.040
 and he built tests for detecting these kinds of things,

45:42.040 --> 45:43.460
 were exactly like this.

45:43.460 --> 45:46.680
 So in other words, when I stick out my hand,

45:47.540 --> 45:49.760
 I want you instead to present your elbow.

45:49.760 --> 45:51.080
 A patient with frontal damage

45:51.080 --> 45:53.520
 would have a great deal of trouble with that.

45:53.520 --> 45:57.760
 Somebody proffering their hand would elicit a handshake.

45:58.800 --> 46:00.920
 The prefrontal cortex is what allows us to say,

46:00.920 --> 46:03.840
 hold on, hold on, that's the usual thing,

46:03.840 --> 46:07.120
 but I have the ability to bear in mind

46:07.120 --> 46:10.520
 even very unusual contexts and to reason about

46:10.520 --> 46:13.240
 what behavior is appropriate there.

46:13.240 --> 46:17.560
 Just to get a sense, are us humans special

46:17.560 --> 46:20.680
 in the presence of the prefrontal cortex?

46:20.680 --> 46:22.640
 Do mice have a prefrontal cortex?

46:22.640 --> 46:25.900
 Do other mammals that we can study?

46:25.900 --> 46:30.040
 If no, then how do they integrate new experiences?

46:30.040 --> 46:33.760
 Yeah, that's a really tricky question

46:33.760 --> 46:35.840
 and a very timely question

46:35.840 --> 46:42.840
 because we have revolutionary new technologies

46:44.040 --> 46:48.280
 for monitoring, measuring,

46:48.280 --> 46:52.040
 and also causally influencing neural behavior

46:52.040 --> 46:57.000
 in mice and fruit flies.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.640
 And these techniques are not fully available

47:00.640 --> 47:05.640
 even for studying brain function in monkeys,

47:06.080 --> 47:07.280
 let alone humans.

47:08.160 --> 47:12.920
 And so it's a very sort of, for me at least,

47:12.920 --> 47:16.160
 a very urgent question whether the kinds of things

47:16.160 --> 47:18.000
 that we wanna understand about human intelligence

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
 can be pursued in these other organisms.

47:22.000 --> 47:26.500
 And to put it briefly, there's disagreement.

47:26.500 --> 47:31.500
 People who study fruit flies will often tell you,

47:32.960 --> 47:35.520
 hey, fruit flies are smarter than you think.

47:35.520 --> 47:37.600
 And they'll point to experiments where fruit flies

47:37.600 --> 47:40.320
 were able to learn new behaviors,

47:40.320 --> 47:44.180
 were able to generalize from one stimulus to another

47:44.180 --> 47:47.500
 in a way that suggests that they have abstractions

47:47.500 --> 47:49.340
 that guide their generalization.

47:51.880 --> 47:53.840
 I've had many conversations in which

47:53.840 --> 47:56.520
 I will start by observing,

47:58.160 --> 48:03.160
 recounting some observation about mouse behavior

48:05.200 --> 48:09.060
 where it seemed like mice were taking an awfully long time

48:09.060 --> 48:13.660
 to learn a task that for a human would be profoundly trivial.

48:13.660 --> 48:16.460
 And I will conclude from that,

48:16.460 --> 48:18.800
 that mice really don't have the cognitive flexibility

48:18.800 --> 48:20.100
 that we want to explain.

48:20.100 --> 48:21.760
 And then a mouse researcher will say to me,

48:21.760 --> 48:26.360
 well, hold on, that experiment may not have worked

48:26.360 --> 48:31.280
 because you asked a mouse to deal with stimuli

48:31.280 --> 48:34.300
 and behaviors that were very unnatural for the mouse.

48:34.300 --> 48:38.760
 If instead you kept the logic of the experiment the same,

48:38.760 --> 48:43.760
 but presented the information in a way

48:44.440 --> 48:46.880
 that aligns with what mice are used to dealing with

48:46.880 --> 48:48.480
 in their natural habitats,

48:48.480 --> 48:51.080
 you might find that a mouse actually has more intelligence

48:51.080 --> 48:52.440
 than you think.

48:52.440 --> 48:54.920
 And then they'll go on to show you videos

48:54.920 --> 48:57.440
 of mice doing things in their natural habitat,

48:57.440 --> 49:00.000
 which seem strikingly intelligent,

49:00.000 --> 49:02.920
 dealing with physical problems.

49:02.920 --> 49:07.180
 I have to drag this piece of food back to my lair,

49:07.180 --> 49:08.560
 but there's something in my way

49:08.560 --> 49:10.400
 and how do I get rid of that thing?

49:10.400 --> 49:13.160
 So I think these are open questions

49:13.160 --> 49:15.400
 to put it, to sum that up.

49:15.400 --> 49:18.520
 And then taking a small step back related to that

49:18.520 --> 49:21.440
 is you kind of mentioned we're taking a little shortcut

49:21.440 --> 49:26.440
 by saying it's a geographic part of the prefrontal cortex

49:26.600 --> 49:28.280
 is a region of the brain.

49:28.280 --> 49:33.280
 But if we, what's your sense in a bigger philosophical view,

49:33.720 --> 49:36.260
 prefrontal cortex and the brain in general,

49:36.260 --> 49:38.840
 do you have a sense that it's a set of subsystems

49:38.840 --> 49:41.180
 in the way we've kind of implied

49:41.180 --> 49:46.180
 that are pretty distinct or to what degree is it that

49:46.180 --> 49:49.460
 or to what degree is it a giant interconnected mess

49:49.460 --> 49:51.380
 where everything kind of does everything

49:51.380 --> 49:53.820
 and it's impossible to disentangle them?

49:54.920 --> 49:57.020
 I think there's overwhelming evidence

49:57.020 --> 50:00.060
 that there's functional differentiation,

50:00.060 --> 50:03.460
 that it's clearly not the case

50:03.460 --> 50:07.100
 that all parts of the brain are doing the same thing.

50:07.100 --> 50:11.100
 This follows immediately from the kinds of studies

50:11.100 --> 50:14.620
 of brain damage that we were chatting about before.

50:14.620 --> 50:18.060
 It's obvious from what you see

50:18.060 --> 50:19.620
 if you stick an electrode in the brain

50:19.620 --> 50:24.540
 and measure what's going on at the level of neural activity.

50:25.960 --> 50:30.680
 Having said that, there are two other things to add,

50:30.680 --> 50:32.740
 which kind of, I don't know,

50:32.740 --> 50:34.340
 maybe tug in the other direction.

50:34.340 --> 50:39.340
 One is that it's when you look carefully

50:39.740 --> 50:42.220
 at functional differentiation in the brain,

50:42.220 --> 50:44.900
 what you usually end up concluding,

50:44.900 --> 50:48.140
 at least this is my observation of the literature,

50:48.140 --> 50:52.780
 is that the differences between regions are graded

50:52.780 --> 50:55.180
 rather than being discreet.

50:55.180 --> 50:57.460
 So it doesn't seem like it's easy

50:57.460 --> 51:01.740
 to divide the brain up into true modules

51:03.300 --> 51:07.460
 that have clear boundaries and that have

51:07.460 --> 51:12.460
 you know, clear channels of communication between them.

51:16.020 --> 51:18.020
 And this applies to the prefrontal cortex?

51:18.020 --> 51:18.860
 Yeah, oh yeah.

51:18.860 --> 51:20.200
 The prefrontal cortex is made up

51:20.200 --> 51:22.080
 of a bunch of different subregions,

51:23.140 --> 51:27.380
 the functions of which are not clearly defined

51:27.380 --> 51:30.820
 and the borders of which seem to be quite vague.

51:32.300 --> 51:34.420
 And then there's another thing that's popping up

51:34.420 --> 51:37.400
 in very recent research, which, you know, which,

51:40.280 --> 51:43.640
 involves application of these new techniques,

51:44.940 --> 51:47.740
 which there are a number of studies that suggest that

51:48.820 --> 51:51.540
 parts of the brain that we would have previously thought

51:51.540 --> 51:56.540
 were quite focused in their function

51:57.740 --> 51:59.100
 are actually carrying signals

51:59.100 --> 52:01.340
 that we wouldn't have thought would be there.

52:01.340 --> 52:04.500
 For example, looking in the primary visual cortex,

52:04.500 --> 52:07.900
 which is classically thought of as basically

52:07.900 --> 52:09.380
 the first cortical way station

52:09.380 --> 52:10.900
 for processing visual information.

52:10.900 --> 52:12.980
 Basically what it should care about is, you know,

52:12.980 --> 52:15.840
 where are the edges in this scene that I'm viewing?

52:17.460 --> 52:19.460
 It turns out that if you have enough data,

52:19.460 --> 52:22.220
 you can recover information from primary visual cortex

52:22.220 --> 52:23.220
 about all sorts of things.

52:23.220 --> 52:26.180
 Like, you know, what behavior the animal is engaged

52:26.180 --> 52:29.340
 in right now and how much reward is on offer

52:29.340 --> 52:31.340
 in the task that it's pursuing.

52:31.340 --> 52:36.340
 So it's clear that even regions whose function

52:36.740 --> 52:40.540
 is pretty well defined at a core screen

52:40.540 --> 52:42.860
 are nonetheless carrying some information

52:42.860 --> 52:47.060
 about information from very different domains.

52:47.060 --> 52:49.780
 So, you know, the history of neuroscience

52:49.780 --> 52:52.660
 is sort of this oscillation between the two views

52:52.660 --> 52:55.460
 that you articulated, you know, the kind of modular view

52:55.460 --> 52:57.740
 and then the big, you know, mush view.

52:57.740 --> 53:01.580
 And, you know, I think, I guess we're gonna end up

53:01.580 --> 53:02.800
 somewhere in the middle.

53:02.800 --> 53:05.580
 Which is unfortunate for our understanding

53:05.580 --> 53:08.880
 because there's something about our, you know,

53:08.880 --> 53:11.380
 conceptual system that finds it's easy to think about

53:11.380 --> 53:13.680
 a modularized system and easy to think about

53:13.680 --> 53:15.500
 a completely undifferentiated system.

53:15.500 --> 53:19.980
 But something that kind of lies in between is confusing.

53:19.980 --> 53:21.860
 But we're gonna have to get used to it, I think.

53:21.860 --> 53:24.660
 Unless we can understand deeply the lower level mechanism

53:24.660 --> 53:25.860
 of neuronal communication.

53:25.860 --> 53:26.760
 Yeah, yeah.

53:26.760 --> 53:29.660
 But on that topic, you kind of mentioned information.

53:29.660 --> 53:31.860
 Just to get a sense, I imagine something

53:31.860 --> 53:34.620
 that there's still mystery and disagreement on

53:34.620 --> 53:38.060
 is how does the brain carry information and signal?

53:38.060 --> 53:43.060
 Like what in your sense is the basic mechanism

53:43.380 --> 53:46.420
 of communication in the brain?

53:46.420 --> 53:51.420
 Well, I guess I'm old fashioned in that I consider

53:52.020 --> 53:54.340
 the networks that we use in deep learning research

53:54.340 --> 53:59.080
 to be a reasonable approximation to, you know,

53:59.080 --> 54:02.500
 the mechanisms that carry information in the brain.

54:02.500 --> 54:06.180
 So the usual way of articulating that is to say,

54:06.180 --> 54:08.540
 what really matters is a rate code.

54:08.540 --> 54:13.540
 What matters is how quickly is an individual neuron spiking?

54:14.580 --> 54:16.380
 You know, what's the frequency at which it's spiking?

54:16.380 --> 54:17.200
 Is it right?

54:17.200 --> 54:18.040
 So the timing of the spike.

54:18.040 --> 54:20.340
 Yeah, is it firing fast or slow?

54:20.340 --> 54:22.740
 Let's, you know, let's put a number on that.

54:22.740 --> 54:24.380
 And that number is enough to capture

54:24.380 --> 54:26.140
 what neurons are doing.

54:26.140 --> 54:30.620
 There's, you know, there's still uncertainty

54:30.620 --> 54:34.500
 about whether that's an adequate description

54:34.500 --> 54:39.500
 of how information is transmitted within the brain.

54:39.880 --> 54:42.820
 There, you know, there are studies that suggest

54:42.820 --> 54:46.060
 that the precise timing of spikes matters.

54:46.060 --> 54:50.660
 There are studies that suggest that there are computations

54:50.660 --> 54:54.520
 that go on within the dendritic tree, within a neuron,

54:54.520 --> 54:57.100
 that are quite rich and structured

54:57.100 --> 54:59.980
 and that really don't equate to anything that we're doing

54:59.980 --> 55:01.740
 in our artificial neural networks.

55:02.820 --> 55:05.360
 Having said that, I feel like we can get,

55:05.360 --> 55:08.260
 I feel like we're getting somewhere

55:08.260 --> 55:11.620
 by sticking to this high level of abstraction.

55:11.620 --> 55:13.380
 Just the rate, and by the way,

55:13.380 --> 55:16.220
 we're talking about the electrical signal.

55:16.220 --> 55:20.060
 I remember reading some vague paper somewhere recently

55:20.060 --> 55:23.420
 where the mechanical signal, like the vibrations

55:23.420 --> 55:28.420
 or something of the neurons, also communicates information.

55:28.820 --> 55:30.260
 I haven't seen that, but.

55:30.260 --> 55:32.100
 There's somebody who was arguing

55:32.100 --> 55:36.840
 that the electrical signal, this is in a nature paper,

55:36.840 --> 55:38.780
 something like that, where the electrical signal

55:38.780 --> 55:43.740
 is actually a side effect of the mechanical signal.

55:43.740 --> 55:46.100
 But I don't think that changes the story.

55:46.100 --> 55:49.060
 But it's almost an interesting idea

55:49.060 --> 55:52.420
 that there could be a deeper, it's always like in physics

55:52.420 --> 55:55.740
 with quantum mechanics, there's always a deeper story

55:55.740 --> 55:57.500
 that could be underlying the whole thing.

55:57.500 --> 56:00.540
 But you think it's basically the rate of spiking

56:00.540 --> 56:02.820
 that gets us, that's like the lowest hanging fruit

56:02.820 --> 56:04.060
 that can get us really far.

56:04.060 --> 56:06.580
 This is a classical view.

56:06.580 --> 56:10.700
 I mean, this is not, the only way in which this stance

56:10.700 --> 56:13.580
 would be controversial is in the sense

56:13.580 --> 56:17.100
 that there are members of the neuroscience community

56:17.100 --> 56:18.820
 who are interested in alternatives.

56:18.820 --> 56:21.400
 But this is really a very mainstream view.

56:21.400 --> 56:22.940
 The way that neurons communicate

56:22.940 --> 56:27.460
 is that neurotransmitters arrive,

56:30.180 --> 56:34.500
 they wash up on a neuron, the neuron has receptors

56:34.500 --> 56:39.040
 for those transmitters, the meeting of the transmitter

56:39.040 --> 56:42.340
 with these receptors changes the voltage of the neuron.

56:42.340 --> 56:46.860
 And if enough voltage change occurs, then a spike occurs,

56:46.860 --> 56:48.660
 one of these like discrete events.

56:48.660 --> 56:52.300
 And it's that spike that is conducted down the axon

56:52.300 --> 56:54.580
 and leads to neurotransmitter release.

56:54.580 --> 56:56.860
 This is just like neuroscience 101.

56:56.860 --> 56:59.300
 This is like the way the brain is supposed to work.

56:59.300 --> 57:03.660
 Now, what we do when we build artificial neural networks

57:03.660 --> 57:06.780
 of the kind that are now popular in the AI community

57:08.060 --> 57:11.780
 is that we don't worry about those individual spikes.

57:11.780 --> 57:14.220
 We just worry about the frequency

57:14.220 --> 57:16.980
 at which those spikes are being generated.

57:16.980 --> 57:21.980
 And people talk about that as the activity of a neuron.

57:22.340 --> 57:27.180
 And so the activity of units in a deep learning system

57:27.180 --> 57:32.180
 is broadly analogous to the spike rate of a neuron.

57:32.900 --> 57:37.900
 There are people who believe that there are other forms

57:38.020 --> 57:39.180
 of communication in the brain.

57:39.180 --> 57:41.260
 In fact, I've been involved in some research recently

57:41.260 --> 57:46.260
 that suggests that the voltage fluctuations

57:46.260 --> 57:49.260
 that occur in populations of neurons

57:49.260 --> 57:54.260
 that are sort of below the level of spike production

57:54.860 --> 57:57.220
 may be important for communication.

57:57.220 --> 58:00.220
 But I'm still pretty old school in the sense

58:00.220 --> 58:02.700
 that I think that the things that we're building

58:02.700 --> 58:06.980
 in AI research constitute reasonable models

58:06.980 --> 58:08.260
 of how a brain would work.

58:10.300 --> 58:14.220
 Let me ask just for fun a crazy question, because I can.

58:14.220 --> 58:17.020
 Do you think it's possible we're completely wrong

58:17.020 --> 58:20.060
 about the way this basic mechanism

58:20.060 --> 58:23.700
 of neuronal communication, that the information

58:23.700 --> 58:26.340
 is stored in some very different kind of way in the brain?

58:26.340 --> 58:27.580
 Oh, heck yes.

58:27.580 --> 58:29.900
 I mean, look, I wouldn't be a scientist

58:29.900 --> 58:32.500
 if I didn't think there was any chance we were wrong.

58:32.500 --> 58:36.420
 But I mean, if you look at the history

58:36.420 --> 58:39.900
 of deep learning research as it's been applied

58:39.900 --> 58:42.620
 to neuroscience, of course the vast majority

58:42.620 --> 58:45.380
 of deep learning research these days isn't about neuroscience.

58:45.380 --> 58:49.060
 But if you go back to the 1980s,

58:49.060 --> 58:52.740
 there's sort of an unbroken chain of research

58:52.740 --> 58:54.940
 in which a particular strategy is taken,

58:54.940 --> 58:59.940
 which is, hey, let's train a deep learning system.

59:00.180 --> 59:04.060
 Let's train a multi layer neural network

59:04.060 --> 59:09.060
 on this task that we trained our rat on,

59:09.260 --> 59:12.300
 or our monkey on, or this human being on.

59:12.300 --> 59:15.700
 And then let's look at what the units

59:15.700 --> 59:17.700
 deep in the system are doing.

59:17.700 --> 59:20.780
 And let's ask whether what they're doing

59:20.780 --> 59:23.260
 resembles what we know about what neurons

59:23.260 --> 59:24.620
 deep in the brain are doing.

59:24.620 --> 59:28.540
 And over and over and over and over,

59:28.540 --> 59:31.140
 that strategy works in the sense that

59:32.020 --> 59:34.340
 the learning algorithms that we have access to,

59:34.340 --> 59:37.740
 which typically center on back propagation,

59:37.740 --> 59:42.060
 they give rise to patterns of activity,

59:42.060 --> 59:44.100
 patterns of response,

59:45.220 --> 59:48.740
 patterns of neuronal behavior in these artificial models

59:48.740 --> 59:53.660
 that look hauntingly similar to what you see in the brain.

59:53.660 --> 59:57.380
 And is that a coincidence?

59:57.380 --> 1:00:00.780
 At a certain point, it starts looking like such coincidence

1:00:00.780 --> 1:00:03.340
 is unlikely to not be deeply meaningful, yeah.

1:00:03.340 --> 1:00:07.140
 Yeah, the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming.

1:00:07.140 --> 1:00:07.980
 But it could be.

1:00:07.980 --> 1:00:10.460
 But you're always open to total flipping at the table.

1:00:10.460 --> 1:00:11.620
 Hey, of course.

1:00:11.620 --> 1:00:15.140
 So you have coauthored several recent papers

1:00:15.140 --> 1:00:17.860
 that sort of weave beautifully between the world

1:00:17.860 --> 1:00:20.660
 of neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

1:00:20.660 --> 1:00:25.660
 And maybe if we could, can we just try to dance around

1:00:26.380 --> 1:00:27.500
 and talk about some of them?

1:00:27.500 --> 1:00:29.740
 Maybe try to pick out interesting ideas

1:00:29.740 --> 1:00:32.300
 that jump to your mind from memory.

1:00:32.300 --> 1:00:34.300
 So maybe looking at, we were talking about

1:00:34.300 --> 1:00:38.220
 the prefrontal cortex, the 2018, I believe, paper

1:00:38.220 --> 1:00:40.060
 called the Prefrontal Cortex

1:00:40.060 --> 1:00:42.140
 as a Meta Reinforcement Learning System.

1:00:42.140 --> 1:00:44.340
 What, is there a key idea

1:00:44.340 --> 1:00:46.700
 that you can speak to from that paper?

1:00:47.660 --> 1:00:52.660
 Yeah, I mean, the key idea is about meta learning.

1:00:53.860 --> 1:00:54.860
 What is meta learning?

1:00:54.860 --> 1:00:58.620
 Meta learning is, by definition,

1:01:00.940 --> 1:01:04.900
 a situation in which you have a learning algorithm

1:01:06.100 --> 1:01:09.780
 and the learning algorithm operates in such a way

1:01:09.780 --> 1:01:14.060
 that it gives rise to another learning algorithm.

1:01:14.060 --> 1:01:17.140
 In the earliest applications of this idea,

1:01:17.140 --> 1:01:20.340
 you had one learning algorithm sort of adjusting

1:01:20.340 --> 1:01:23.060
 the parameters on another learning algorithm.

1:01:23.060 --> 1:01:25.100
 But the case that we're interested in this paper

1:01:25.100 --> 1:01:29.140
 is one where you start with just one learning algorithm

1:01:29.140 --> 1:01:33.020
 and then another learning algorithm kind of emerges

1:01:33.020 --> 1:01:35.180
 out of thin air.

1:01:35.180 --> 1:01:36.700
 I can say more about what I mean by that.

1:01:36.700 --> 1:01:39.780
 I don't mean to be scurrentist,

1:01:39.780 --> 1:01:44.140
 but that's the idea of meta learning.

1:01:44.140 --> 1:01:46.020
 It relates to the old idea in psychology

1:01:46.020 --> 1:01:47.300
 of learning to learn.

1:01:49.380 --> 1:01:54.300
 Situations where you have experiences

1:01:54.300 --> 1:01:57.980
 that make you better at learning something new.

1:01:57.980 --> 1:02:01.380
 A familiar example would be learning a foreign language.

1:02:01.380 --> 1:02:02.860
 The first time you learn a foreign language,

1:02:02.860 --> 1:02:06.420
 it may be quite laborious and disorienting

1:02:06.420 --> 1:02:10.300
 and novel, but let's say you've learned

1:02:10.300 --> 1:02:12.220
 two foreign languages.

1:02:12.220 --> 1:02:14.140
 The third foreign language, obviously,

1:02:14.140 --> 1:02:15.940
 is gonna be much easier to pick up.

1:02:15.940 --> 1:02:16.780
 And why?

1:02:16.780 --> 1:02:18.220
 Because you've learned how to learn.

1:02:18.220 --> 1:02:20.220
 You know how this goes.

1:02:20.220 --> 1:02:22.140
 You know, okay, I'm gonna have to learn how to conjugate.

1:02:22.140 --> 1:02:23.940
 I'm gonna have to...

1:02:23.940 --> 1:02:26.340
 That's a simple form of meta learning

1:02:26.340 --> 1:02:30.260
 in the sense that there's some slow learning mechanism

1:02:30.260 --> 1:02:33.020
 that's helping you kind of update

1:02:33.020 --> 1:02:34.300
 your fast learning mechanism.

1:02:34.300 --> 1:02:35.660
 Does that make sense?

1:02:35.660 --> 1:02:40.540
 So how from our understanding from the psychology world,

1:02:40.540 --> 1:02:43.180
 from neuroscience, our understanding

1:02:43.180 --> 1:02:47.180
 how meta learning might work in the human brain,

1:02:47.180 --> 1:02:49.980
 what lessons can we draw from that

1:02:49.980 --> 1:02:53.060
 that we can bring into the artificial intelligence world?

1:02:53.060 --> 1:02:55.980
 Well, yeah, so the origin of that paper

1:02:55.980 --> 1:03:00.180
 was in AI work that we were doing in my group.

1:03:00.180 --> 1:03:03.700
 We were looking at what happens

1:03:03.700 --> 1:03:06.260
 when you train a recurrent neural network

1:03:06.260 --> 1:03:10.180
 using standard reinforcement learning algorithms.

1:03:10.180 --> 1:03:12.660
 But you train that network, not just in one task,

1:03:12.660 --> 1:03:15.140
 but you train it in a bunch of interrelated tasks.

1:03:15.140 --> 1:03:18.700
 And then you ask what happens when you give it

1:03:18.700 --> 1:03:23.380
 yet another task in that sort of line of interrelated tasks.

1:03:23.380 --> 1:03:27.500
 And what we started to realize is that

1:03:29.380 --> 1:03:31.860
 a form of meta learning spontaneously happens

1:03:31.860 --> 1:03:33.780
 in recurrent neural networks.

1:03:33.780 --> 1:03:37.700
 And the simplest way to explain it is to say

1:03:39.540 --> 1:03:43.500
 a recurrent neural network has a kind of memory

1:03:43.500 --> 1:03:45.340
 in its activation patterns.

1:03:45.340 --> 1:03:47.540
 It's recurrent by definition in the sense

1:03:47.540 --> 1:03:50.180
 that you have units that connect to other units,

1:03:50.180 --> 1:03:51.060
 that connect to other units.

1:03:51.060 --> 1:03:53.660
 So you have sort of loops of connectivity,

1:03:53.660 --> 1:03:55.740
 which allows activity to stick around

1:03:55.740 --> 1:03:57.380
 and be updated over time.

1:03:57.380 --> 1:03:59.020
 In psychology we call, in neuroscience

1:03:59.020 --> 1:04:00.100
 we call this working memory.

1:04:00.100 --> 1:04:03.020
 It's like actively holding something in mind.

1:04:04.260 --> 1:04:09.260
 And so that memory gives

1:04:09.260 --> 1:04:13.100
 the recurrent neural network a dynamics, right?

1:04:13.100 --> 1:04:17.700
 The way that the activity pattern evolves over time

1:04:17.700 --> 1:04:19.980
 is inherent to the connectivity

1:04:19.980 --> 1:04:21.580
 of the recurrent neural network, okay?

1:04:21.580 --> 1:04:23.500
 So that's idea number one.

1:04:23.500 --> 1:04:26.020
 Now, the dynamics of that network are shaped

1:04:26.020 --> 1:04:29.660
 by the connectivity, by the synaptic weights.

1:04:29.660 --> 1:04:31.660
 And those synaptic weights are being shaped

1:04:31.660 --> 1:04:33.860
 by this reinforcement learning algorithm

1:04:33.860 --> 1:04:36.020
 that you're training the network with.

1:04:37.700 --> 1:04:41.260
 So the punchline is if you train a recurrent neural network

1:04:41.260 --> 1:04:43.140
 with a reinforcement learning algorithm

1:04:43.140 --> 1:04:44.180
 that's adjusting its weights,

1:04:44.180 --> 1:04:45.940
 and you do that for long enough,

1:04:47.060 --> 1:04:50.860
 the activation dynamics will become very interesting, right?

1:04:50.860 --> 1:04:53.180
 So imagine I give you a task

1:04:53.180 --> 1:04:56.060
 where you have to press one button or another,

1:04:56.060 --> 1:04:57.580
 left button or right button.

1:04:57.580 --> 1:05:00.820
 And there's some probability

1:05:00.820 --> 1:05:02.260
 that I'm gonna give you an M&M

1:05:02.260 --> 1:05:04.220
 if you press the left button,

1:05:04.220 --> 1:05:06.220
 and there's some probability I'll give you an M&M

1:05:06.220 --> 1:05:07.620
 if you press the other button.

1:05:07.620 --> 1:05:09.340
 And you have to figure out what those probabilities are

1:05:09.340 --> 1:05:10.700
 just by trying things out.

1:05:12.060 --> 1:05:13.780
 But as I said before,

1:05:13.780 --> 1:05:15.500
 instead of just giving you one of these tasks,

1:05:15.500 --> 1:05:17.020
 I give you a whole sequence.

1:05:17.020 --> 1:05:18.700
 You know, I give you two buttons

1:05:18.700 --> 1:05:19.860
 and you figure out which one's best.

1:05:19.860 --> 1:05:22.180
 And I go, good job, here's a new box.

1:05:22.180 --> 1:05:24.100
 Two new buttons, you have to figure out which one's best.

1:05:24.100 --> 1:05:25.420
 Good job, here's a new box.

1:05:25.420 --> 1:05:27.340
 And every box has its own probabilities

1:05:27.340 --> 1:05:28.300
 and you have to figure it out.

1:05:28.300 --> 1:05:30.420
 So if you train a recurrent neural network

1:05:30.420 --> 1:05:32.660
 on that kind of sequence of tasks,

1:05:33.700 --> 1:05:37.380
 what happens, it seemed almost magical to us

1:05:37.380 --> 1:05:41.180
 when we first started kind of realizing what was going on.

1:05:41.180 --> 1:05:43.620
 The slow learning algorithm that's adjusting

1:05:43.620 --> 1:05:45.540
 the synaptic weights,

1:05:46.980 --> 1:05:51.380
 those slow synaptic changes give rise to a network dynamics

1:05:51.380 --> 1:05:53.020
 that themselves, that, you know,

1:05:53.020 --> 1:05:56.860
 the dynamics themselves turn into a learning algorithm.

1:05:56.860 --> 1:05:59.060
 So in other words, you can tell this is happening

1:05:59.060 --> 1:06:01.020
 by just freezing the synaptic weights saying,

1:06:01.020 --> 1:06:03.460
 okay, no more learning, you're done.

1:06:03.460 --> 1:06:07.620
 Here's a new box, figure out which button is best.

1:06:07.620 --> 1:06:09.620
 And the recurrent neural network will do this just fine.

1:06:09.620 --> 1:06:13.060
 There's no, like it figures out which button is best.

1:06:13.060 --> 1:06:16.700
 It kind of transitions from exploring the two buttons

1:06:16.700 --> 1:06:18.380
 to just pressing the one that it likes best

1:06:18.380 --> 1:06:20.700
 in a very rational way.

1:06:20.700 --> 1:06:21.660
 How is that happening?

1:06:21.660 --> 1:06:24.700
 It's happening because the activity dynamics

1:06:24.700 --> 1:06:28.460
 of the network have been shaped by the slow learning process

1:06:28.460 --> 1:06:30.660
 that's occurred over many, many boxes.

1:06:30.660 --> 1:06:34.660
 And so what's happened is that this slow learning algorithm

1:06:34.660 --> 1:06:37.140
 that's slowly adjusting the weights

1:06:37.140 --> 1:06:39.740
 is changing the dynamics of the network,

1:06:39.740 --> 1:06:43.460
 the activity dynamics into its own learning algorithm.

1:06:43.460 --> 1:06:48.460
 And as we were kind of realizing that this is a thing,

1:06:51.340 --> 1:06:53.740
 it just so happened that the group that was working on this

1:06:53.740 --> 1:06:56.020
 included a bunch of neuroscientists

1:06:56.020 --> 1:06:59.900
 and it started kind of ringing a bell for us,

1:06:59.900 --> 1:07:02.860
 which is to say that we thought this sounds a lot

1:07:02.860 --> 1:07:06.180
 like the distinction between synaptic learning

1:07:06.180 --> 1:07:08.460
 and activity, synaptic memory

1:07:08.460 --> 1:07:10.460
 and activity based memory in the brain.

1:07:11.700 --> 1:07:15.900
 And it also reminded us of recurrent connectivity

1:07:15.900 --> 1:07:18.420
 that's very characteristic of prefrontal function.

1:07:19.620 --> 1:07:22.820
 So this is kind of why it's good to have people working

1:07:22.820 --> 1:07:26.180
 on AI that know a little bit about neuroscience

1:07:26.180 --> 1:07:29.340
 and vice versa, because we started thinking

1:07:29.340 --> 1:07:32.340
 about whether we could apply this principle to neuroscience.

1:07:32.340 --> 1:07:33.660
 And that's where the paper came from.

1:07:33.660 --> 1:07:37.540
 So the kind of principle of the recurrence

1:07:37.540 --> 1:07:39.540
 they can see in the prefrontal cortex,

1:07:39.540 --> 1:07:43.660
 then you start to realize that it's possible

1:07:43.660 --> 1:07:46.340
 for something like an idea of a learning

1:07:46.340 --> 1:07:50.860
 to learn emerging from this learning process

1:07:50.860 --> 1:07:54.500
 as long as you keep varying the environment sufficiently.

1:07:54.500 --> 1:07:59.300
 Exactly, so the kind of metaphorical transition

1:07:59.300 --> 1:08:00.740
 we made to neuroscience was to think,

1:08:00.740 --> 1:08:03.660
 okay, well, we know that the prefrontal cortex

1:08:03.660 --> 1:08:04.940
 is highly recurrent.

1:08:04.940 --> 1:08:08.500
 We know that it's an important locus for working memory

1:08:08.500 --> 1:08:11.260
 for activation based memory.

1:08:11.260 --> 1:08:13.660
 So maybe the prefrontal cortex

1:08:13.660 --> 1:08:15.620
 supports reinforcement learning.

1:08:15.620 --> 1:08:19.260
 In other words, what is reinforcement learning?

1:08:19.260 --> 1:08:21.620
 You take an action, you see how much reward you got,

1:08:21.620 --> 1:08:23.580
 you update your policy of behavior.

1:08:24.580 --> 1:08:26.860
 Maybe the prefrontal cortex is doing that sort of thing

1:08:26.860 --> 1:08:28.500
 strictly in its activation patterns.

1:08:28.500 --> 1:08:31.900
 It's keeping around a memory in its activity patterns

1:08:31.900 --> 1:08:35.340
 of what you did, how much reward you got,

1:08:35.340 --> 1:08:38.980
 and it's using that activity based memory

1:08:38.980 --> 1:08:41.100
 as a basis for updating behavior.

1:08:41.100 --> 1:08:42.180
 But then the question is, well,

1:08:42.180 --> 1:08:44.540
 how did the prefrontal cortex get so smart?

1:08:44.540 --> 1:08:48.020
 In other words, where did these activity dynamics come from?

1:08:48.020 --> 1:08:50.780
 How did that program that's implemented

1:08:50.780 --> 1:08:54.460
 in the recurrent dynamics of the prefrontal cortex arise?

1:08:54.460 --> 1:08:58.060
 And one answer that became evident in this work was,

1:08:58.060 --> 1:09:00.940
 well, maybe the mechanisms that operate

1:09:00.940 --> 1:09:05.020
 on the synaptic level, which we believe are mediated

1:09:05.020 --> 1:09:08.740
 by dopamine, are responsible for shaping those dynamics.

1:09:10.180 --> 1:09:12.420
 So this may be a silly question,

1:09:12.420 --> 1:09:17.420
 but because this kind of several temporal sort of classes

1:09:19.340 --> 1:09:23.020
 of learning are happening and the learning to learnism

1:09:23.020 --> 1:09:28.020
 emerges, can you keep building stacks of learning

1:09:28.660 --> 1:09:30.940
 to learn to learn, learning to learn to learn

1:09:30.940 --> 1:09:32.900
 to learn to learn because it keeps,

1:09:32.900 --> 1:09:37.020
 I mean, basically abstractions of more powerful abilities

1:09:37.020 --> 1:09:41.140
 to generalize of learning complex rules.

1:09:41.140 --> 1:09:46.100
 Yeah, that's overstretching this kind of mechanism.

1:09:46.100 --> 1:09:51.100
 Well, one of the people in AI who started thinking

1:09:51.260 --> 1:09:54.700
 about meta learning from very early on,

1:09:54.700 --> 1:09:59.700
 Jürgen Schmidhuber sort of cheekily suggested,

1:09:59.780 --> 1:10:03.900
 I think it may have been in his PhD thesis,

1:10:03.900 --> 1:10:06.900
 that we should think about meta, meta, meta,

1:10:06.900 --> 1:10:08.740
 meta, meta, meta learning.

1:10:08.740 --> 1:10:13.140
 That's really what's gonna get us to true intelligence.

1:10:13.140 --> 1:10:15.380
 Certainly there's a poetic aspect to it

1:10:15.380 --> 1:10:19.260
 and it seems interesting and correct

1:10:19.260 --> 1:10:21.660
 that that kind of levels of abstraction would be powerful,

1:10:21.660 --> 1:10:23.940
 but is that something you see in the brain?

1:10:23.940 --> 1:10:27.780
 This kind of, is it useful to think of learning

1:10:27.780 --> 1:10:32.100
 in these meta, meta, meta way or is it just meta learning?

1:10:32.100 --> 1:10:35.300
 Well, one thing that really fascinated me

1:10:35.300 --> 1:10:39.020
 about this mechanism that we were starting to look at,

1:10:39.020 --> 1:10:41.100
 and other groups started talking

1:10:41.100 --> 1:10:44.740
 about very similar things at the same time.

1:10:44.740 --> 1:10:47.020
 And then a kind of explosion of interest

1:10:47.020 --> 1:10:48.980
 in meta learning happened in the AI community

1:10:48.980 --> 1:10:50.580
 shortly after that.

1:10:50.580 --> 1:10:52.060
 I don't know if we had anything to do with that,

1:10:52.060 --> 1:10:55.620
 but I was gratified to see that a lot of people

1:10:55.620 --> 1:10:57.780
 started talking about meta learning.

1:10:57.780 --> 1:11:01.380
 One of the things that I liked about the kind of flavor

1:11:01.380 --> 1:11:04.060
 of meta learning that we were studying was that

1:11:04.060 --> 1:11:05.940
 it didn't require anything special.

1:11:05.940 --> 1:11:08.620
 It was just, if you took a system that had

1:11:08.620 --> 1:11:12.460
 some form of memory that the function of which

1:11:12.460 --> 1:11:16.860
 could be shaped by pick URL algorithm,

1:11:16.860 --> 1:11:19.100
 then this would just happen, right?

1:11:19.100 --> 1:11:21.300
 I mean, there are a lot of forms of,

1:11:21.300 --> 1:11:23.180
 there are a lot of meta learning algorithms

1:11:23.180 --> 1:11:24.500
 that have been proposed since then

1:11:24.500 --> 1:11:26.580
 that are fascinating and effective

1:11:26.580 --> 1:11:29.780
 in their domains of application.

1:11:29.780 --> 1:11:32.580
 But they're engineered, they're things that somebody

1:11:32.580 --> 1:11:34.340
 had to say, well, gee, if we wanted meta learning

1:11:34.340 --> 1:11:35.700
 to happen, how would we do that?

1:11:35.700 --> 1:11:37.060
 Here's an algorithm that would,

1:11:37.060 --> 1:11:39.500
 but there's something about the kind of meta learning

1:11:39.500 --> 1:11:42.540
 that we were studying that seemed to me special

1:11:42.540 --> 1:11:44.980
 in the sense that it wasn't an algorithm.

1:11:44.980 --> 1:11:48.740
 It was just something that automatically happened

1:11:48.740 --> 1:11:51.060
 if you had a system that had memory

1:11:51.060 --> 1:11:54.020
 and it was trained with a reinforcement learning algorithm.

1:11:54.020 --> 1:11:59.020
 And in that sense, it can be as meta as it wants to be.

1:11:59.020 --> 1:12:04.020
 There's no limit on how abstract the meta learning can get

1:12:04.700 --> 1:12:07.980
 because it's not reliant on a human engineering

1:12:07.980 --> 1:12:11.540
 a particular meta learning algorithm to get there.

1:12:11.540 --> 1:12:15.140
 And that's, I also, I don't know,

1:12:15.140 --> 1:12:17.820
 I guess I hope that that's relevant in the brain.

1:12:17.820 --> 1:12:19.180
 I think there's a kind of beauty

1:12:19.180 --> 1:12:23.380
 in the ability of this emergent.

1:12:23.380 --> 1:12:26.460
 The emergent aspect of it, as opposed to engineered.

1:12:26.460 --> 1:12:29.020
 Exactly, it's something that just, it just happens

1:12:29.020 --> 1:12:33.620
 in a sense, in a sense, you can't avoid this happening.

1:12:33.620 --> 1:12:35.820
 If you have a system that has memory

1:12:35.820 --> 1:12:39.660
 and the function of that memory is shaped

1:12:39.660 --> 1:12:42.740
 by reinforcement learning, and this system is trained

1:12:42.740 --> 1:12:46.900
 in a series of interrelated tasks, this is gonna happen.

1:12:46.900 --> 1:12:48.460
 You can't stop it.

1:12:48.460 --> 1:12:50.140
 As long as you have certain properties,

1:12:50.140 --> 1:12:52.540
 maybe like a recurrent structure to.

1:12:52.540 --> 1:12:53.380
 You have to have memory.

1:12:53.380 --> 1:12:55.220
 It actually doesn't have to be a recurrent neural network.

1:12:55.220 --> 1:12:58.740
 One of, a paper that I was honored to be involved

1:12:58.740 --> 1:13:02.260
 with even earlier, used a kind of slot based memory.

1:13:02.260 --> 1:13:03.100
 Do you remember the title?

1:13:03.100 --> 1:13:05.060
 Just for people to understand.

1:13:05.060 --> 1:13:08.140
 It was Memory Augmented Neural Networks.

1:13:08.140 --> 1:13:10.180
 I think it was, I think the title was

1:13:10.180 --> 1:13:13.040
 Meta Learning in Memory Augmented Neural Networks.

1:13:14.660 --> 1:13:17.940
 And it was the same exact story.

1:13:17.940 --> 1:13:21.100
 If you have a system with memory,

1:13:21.100 --> 1:13:22.780
 here it was a different kind of memory,

1:13:22.780 --> 1:13:26.860
 but the function of that memory is shaped

1:13:26.860 --> 1:13:28.600
 by reinforcement learning.

1:13:29.900 --> 1:13:34.300
 Here it was the reads and writes that occurred

1:13:34.300 --> 1:13:36.420
 on this slot based memory.

1:13:36.420 --> 1:13:38.080
 This will just happen.

1:13:39.940 --> 1:13:42.060
 But this brings us back to something I was saying earlier

1:13:42.060 --> 1:13:44.500
 about the importance of the environment.

1:13:46.340 --> 1:13:49.940
 This will happen if the system is being trained

1:13:49.940 --> 1:13:53.060
 in a setting where there's like a sequence of tasks

1:13:53.060 --> 1:13:55.240
 that all share some abstract structure.

1:13:56.100 --> 1:13:59.020
 Sometimes we talk about task distributions.

1:13:59.020 --> 1:14:04.020
 And that's something that's very obviously true

1:14:04.180 --> 1:14:06.360
 of the world that humans inhabit.

1:14:09.500 --> 1:14:13.140
 Like if you just kind of think about what you do every day,

1:14:13.140 --> 1:14:16.280
 you never do exactly the same thing

1:14:16.280 --> 1:14:17.640
 that you did the day before.

1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:21.060
 But everything that you do sort of has a family resemblance.

1:14:21.060 --> 1:14:23.500
 It shares a structure with something that you did before.

1:14:23.500 --> 1:14:26.700
 And so the real world is sort of

1:14:29.260 --> 1:14:32.700
 saturated with this kind of, this property.

1:14:32.700 --> 1:14:37.540
 It's endless variety with endless redundancy.

1:14:37.540 --> 1:14:38.700
 And that's the setting in which

1:14:38.700 --> 1:14:40.540
 this kind of meta learning happens.

1:14:40.540 --> 1:14:44.980
 And it does seem like we're just so good at finding,

1:14:44.980 --> 1:14:47.820
 just like in this emergent phenomena you described,

1:14:47.820 --> 1:14:50.020
 we're really good at finding that redundancy,

1:14:50.020 --> 1:14:53.480
 finding those similarities, the family resemblance.

1:14:53.480 --> 1:14:56.560
 Some people call it sort of, what is it?

1:14:56.560 --> 1:14:59.180
 Melanie Mitchell was talking about analogies.

1:14:59.180 --> 1:15:01.940
 So we're able to connect concepts together

1:15:01.940 --> 1:15:03.860
 in this kind of way,

1:15:03.860 --> 1:15:06.020
 in this same kind of automated emergent way,

1:15:06.020 --> 1:15:08.620
 which there's so many echoes here

1:15:08.620 --> 1:15:10.640
 of psychology and neuroscience.

1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:15.300
 And obviously now with reinforcement learning

1:15:15.300 --> 1:15:18.260
 with recurrent neural networks at the core.

1:15:18.260 --> 1:15:20.180
 If we could talk a little bit about dopamine,

1:15:20.180 --> 1:15:23.780
 you have really, you're a part of coauthoring

1:15:23.780 --> 1:15:26.420
 really exciting recent paper, very recent,

1:15:26.420 --> 1:15:28.900
 in terms of release on dopamine

1:15:28.900 --> 1:15:31.040
 and temporal difference learning.

1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:34.820
 Can you describe the key ideas of that paper?

1:15:34.820 --> 1:15:35.660
 Sure, yeah.

1:15:35.660 --> 1:15:37.740
 I mean, one thing I want to pause to do

1:15:37.740 --> 1:15:39.460
 is acknowledge my coauthors

1:15:39.460 --> 1:15:41.540
 on actually both of the papers we're talking about.

1:15:41.540 --> 1:15:42.660
 So this dopamine paper.

1:15:42.660 --> 1:15:45.700
 I'll just, I'll certainly post all their names.

1:15:45.700 --> 1:15:46.540
 Okay, wonderful.

1:15:46.540 --> 1:15:49.300
 Yeah, because I'm sort of abashed

1:15:49.300 --> 1:15:51.000
 to be the spokesperson for these papers

1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:55.180
 when I had such amazing collaborators on both.

1:15:55.180 --> 1:15:56.980
 So it's a comfort to me to know

1:15:56.980 --> 1:15:58.580
 that you'll acknowledge them.

1:15:58.580 --> 1:16:00.420
 Yeah, there's an incredible team there, but yeah.

1:16:00.420 --> 1:16:03.080
 Oh yeah, it's such a, it's so much fun.

1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:06.360
 And in the case of the dopamine paper,

1:16:06.360 --> 1:16:09.020
 we also collaborated with Naochit at Harvard,

1:16:09.020 --> 1:16:11.180
 who, you know, obviously a paper simply

1:16:11.180 --> 1:16:12.620
 wouldn't have happened without him.

1:16:12.620 --> 1:16:17.540
 But so you were asking for like a thumbnail sketch of.

1:16:17.540 --> 1:16:20.820
 Yeah, thumbnail sketch or key ideas or, you know,

1:16:20.820 --> 1:16:22.500
 things, the insights that are, you know,

1:16:22.500 --> 1:16:24.780
 continuing on our kind of discussion here

1:16:24.780 --> 1:16:26.900
 between neuroscience and AI.

1:16:26.900 --> 1:16:28.860
 Yeah, I mean, this was another,

1:16:28.860 --> 1:16:30.620
 a lot of the work that we've done so far

1:16:30.620 --> 1:16:35.380
 is taking ideas that have bubbled up in AI

1:16:35.380 --> 1:16:39.660
 and, you know, asking the question of whether the brain

1:16:39.660 --> 1:16:41.460
 might be doing something related,

1:16:41.460 --> 1:16:45.420
 which I think on the surface sounds like something

1:16:45.420 --> 1:16:48.360
 that's really mainly of use to neuroscience.

1:16:49.380 --> 1:16:53.600
 We see it also as a way of validating

1:16:53.600 --> 1:16:55.320
 what we're doing on the AI side.

1:16:55.320 --> 1:16:57.940
 If we can gain some evidence that the brain

1:16:57.940 --> 1:17:01.760
 is using some technique that we've been trying out

1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:05.500
 in our AI work, that gives us confidence

1:17:05.500 --> 1:17:07.780
 that, you know, it may be a good idea,

1:17:07.780 --> 1:17:11.560
 that it'll, you know, scale to rich, complex tasks,

1:17:11.560 --> 1:17:14.840
 that it'll interface well with other mechanisms.

1:17:14.840 --> 1:17:16.860
 So you see it as a two way road.

1:17:16.860 --> 1:17:18.520
 Yeah, for sure. Just because a particular paper

1:17:18.520 --> 1:17:21.140
 is a little bit focused on from one to the,

1:17:21.140 --> 1:17:25.620
 from AI, from neural networks to neuroscience.

1:17:25.620 --> 1:17:28.380
 Ultimately the discussion, the thinking,

1:17:28.380 --> 1:17:30.840
 the productive longterm aspect of it

1:17:30.840 --> 1:17:33.220
 is the two way road nature of the whole interaction.

1:17:33.220 --> 1:17:36.260
 Yeah, I mean, we've talked about the notion

1:17:36.260 --> 1:17:39.300
 of a virtuous circle between AI and neuroscience.

1:17:39.300 --> 1:17:41.820
 And, you know, the way I see it,

1:17:42.660 --> 1:17:47.460
 that's always been there since the two fields,

1:17:47.460 --> 1:17:49.040
 you know, jointly existed.

1:17:50.100 --> 1:17:52.140
 There have been some phases in that history

1:17:52.140 --> 1:17:53.540
 when AI was sort of ahead.

1:17:53.540 --> 1:17:56.340
 There are some phases when neuroscience was sort of ahead.

1:17:56.340 --> 1:18:00.660
 I feel like given the burst of innovation

1:18:00.660 --> 1:18:03.780
 that's happened recently on the AI side,

1:18:03.780 --> 1:18:06.320
 AI is kind of ahead in the sense that

1:18:06.320 --> 1:18:10.620
 there are all of these ideas that we, you know,

1:18:10.620 --> 1:18:12.660
 for which it's exciting to consider

1:18:12.660 --> 1:18:14.720
 that there might be neural analogs.

1:18:16.100 --> 1:18:19.620
 And neuroscience, you know,

1:18:19.620 --> 1:18:22.420
 in a sense has been focusing on approaches

1:18:22.420 --> 1:18:24.860
 to studying behavior that come from, you know,

1:18:24.860 --> 1:18:27.540
 that are kind of derived from this earlier era

1:18:27.540 --> 1:18:29.620
 of cognitive psychology.

1:18:29.620 --> 1:18:33.540
 And, you know, so in some ways fail to connect

1:18:33.540 --> 1:18:36.700
 with some of the issues that we're grappling with in AI.

1:18:36.700 --> 1:18:37.940
 Like how do we deal with, you know,

1:18:37.940 --> 1:18:40.180
 large, you know, complex environments.

1:18:41.560 --> 1:18:45.220
 But, you know, I think it's inevitable

1:18:45.220 --> 1:18:47.920
 that this circle will keep turning

1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:49.540
 and there will be a moment

1:18:49.540 --> 1:18:51.300
 in the not too different distant future

1:18:51.300 --> 1:18:54.640
 when neuroscience is pelting AI researchers

1:18:54.640 --> 1:18:58.260
 with insights that may change the direction of our work.

1:18:58.260 --> 1:19:00.940
 Just a quick human question.

1:19:00.940 --> 1:19:05.460
 Is it, you have parts of your brain,

1:19:05.460 --> 1:19:08.260
 this is very meta, but they're able to both think

1:19:08.260 --> 1:19:10.300
 about neuroscience and AI.

1:19:10.300 --> 1:19:14.220
 You know, I don't often meet people like that.

1:19:14.220 --> 1:19:19.220
 So do you think, let me ask a meta plasticity question.

1:19:19.780 --> 1:19:22.660
 Do you think a human being can be both good at AI

1:19:22.660 --> 1:19:23.580
 and neuroscience?

1:19:23.580 --> 1:19:26.500
 It's like what, on the team at DeepMind,

1:19:26.500 --> 1:19:30.180
 what kind of human can occupy these two realms?

1:19:30.180 --> 1:19:33.340
 And is that something you see everybody should be doing,

1:19:33.340 --> 1:19:36.620
 can be doing, or is that a very special few

1:19:36.620 --> 1:19:37.460
 can kind of jump?

1:19:37.460 --> 1:19:39.180
 Just like we talk about art history,

1:19:39.180 --> 1:19:41.020
 I would think it's a special person

1:19:41.020 --> 1:19:43.620
 that can major in art history

1:19:43.620 --> 1:19:46.860
 and also consider being a surgeon.

1:19:46.860 --> 1:19:48.380
 Otherwise known as a dilettante.

1:19:48.380 --> 1:19:50.140
 A dilettante, yeah.

1:19:50.140 --> 1:19:52.100
 Easily distracted.

1:19:52.100 --> 1:19:57.100
 No, I think it does take a special kind of person

1:19:58.620 --> 1:20:02.660
 to be truly world class at both AI and neuroscience.

1:20:02.660 --> 1:20:04.460
 And I am not on that list.

1:20:05.940 --> 1:20:10.300
 I happen to be someone whose interest in neuroscience

1:20:10.300 --> 1:20:15.300
 and psychology involved using the kinds

1:20:15.940 --> 1:20:20.940
 of modeling techniques that are now very central in AI.

1:20:20.940 --> 1:20:24.140
 And that sort of, I guess, bought me a ticket

1:20:24.140 --> 1:20:26.500
 to be involved in all of the amazing things

1:20:26.500 --> 1:20:29.500
 that are going on in AI research right now.

1:20:29.500 --> 1:20:32.660
 I do know a few people who I would consider

1:20:32.660 --> 1:20:34.780
 pretty expert on both fronts,

1:20:34.780 --> 1:20:36.260
 and I won't embarrass them by naming them,

1:20:36.260 --> 1:20:40.540
 but there are exceptional people out there

1:20:40.540 --> 1:20:41.380
 who are like this.

1:20:41.380 --> 1:20:45.900
 The one thing that I find is a barrier

1:20:45.900 --> 1:20:49.300
 to being truly world class on both fronts

1:20:49.300 --> 1:20:54.300
 is just the complexity of the technology

1:20:54.980 --> 1:20:58.180
 that's involved in both disciplines now.

1:20:58.180 --> 1:21:02.980
 So the engineering expertise that it takes

1:21:02.980 --> 1:21:07.860
 to do truly frontline, hands on AI research

1:21:07.860 --> 1:21:10.620
 is really, really considerable.

1:21:10.620 --> 1:21:11.940
 The learning curve of the tools,

1:21:11.940 --> 1:21:15.260
 just like the specifics of just whether it's programming

1:21:15.260 --> 1:21:17.500
 or the kind of tools necessary to collect the data,

1:21:17.500 --> 1:21:19.780
 to manage the data, to distribute, to compute,

1:21:19.780 --> 1:21:20.780
 all that kind of stuff.

1:21:20.780 --> 1:21:22.380
 And on the neuroscience, I guess, side,

1:21:22.380 --> 1:21:24.580
 there'll be all different sets of tools.

1:21:24.580 --> 1:21:26.820
 Exactly, especially with the recent explosion

1:21:26.820 --> 1:21:28.980
 in neuroscience methods.

1:21:28.980 --> 1:21:32.100
 So having said all that,

1:21:32.100 --> 1:21:37.100
 I think the best scenario for both neuroscience

1:21:39.860 --> 1:21:44.860
 and AI is to have people interacting

1:21:44.860 --> 1:21:48.140
 who live at every point on this spectrum

1:21:48.140 --> 1:21:51.900
 from exclusively focused on neuroscience

1:21:51.900 --> 1:21:55.540
 to exclusively focused on the engineering side of AI.

1:21:55.540 --> 1:22:00.540
 But to have those people inhabiting a community

1:22:01.060 --> 1:22:03.740
 where they're talking to people who live elsewhere

1:22:03.740 --> 1:22:04.820
 on the spectrum.

1:22:04.820 --> 1:22:08.660
 And I may be someone who's very close to the center

1:22:08.660 --> 1:22:12.180
 in the sense that I have one foot in the neuroscience world

1:22:12.180 --> 1:22:14.020
 and one foot in the AI world,

1:22:14.020 --> 1:22:17.220
 and that central position, I will admit,

1:22:17.220 --> 1:22:19.060
 prevents me, at least someone

1:22:19.060 --> 1:22:21.300
 with my limited cognitive capacity,

1:22:21.300 --> 1:22:26.300
 from having true technical expertise in either domain.

1:22:26.820 --> 1:22:30.140
 But at the same time, I at least hope

1:22:30.140 --> 1:22:32.340
 that it's worthwhile having people around

1:22:32.340 --> 1:22:34.980
 who can kind of see the connections.

1:22:34.980 --> 1:22:39.100
 Yeah, the community, the emergent intelligence

1:22:39.100 --> 1:22:43.300
 of the community when it's nicely distributed is useful.

1:22:43.300 --> 1:22:44.580
 Exactly, yeah.

1:22:44.580 --> 1:22:46.620
 So hopefully that, I mean, I've seen that work,

1:22:46.620 --> 1:22:48.420
 I've seen that work out well at DeepMind.

1:22:48.420 --> 1:22:52.860
 There are people who, I mean, even if you just focus

1:22:52.860 --> 1:22:55.820
 on the AI work that happens at DeepMind,

1:22:55.820 --> 1:22:59.540
 it's been a good thing to have some people around

1:22:59.540 --> 1:23:03.260
 doing that kind of work whose PhDs are in neuroscience

1:23:03.260 --> 1:23:04.780
 or psychology.

1:23:04.780 --> 1:23:09.780
 Every academic discipline has its kind of blind spots

1:23:09.780 --> 1:23:14.780
 and kind of unfortunate obsessions and its metaphors

1:23:16.820 --> 1:23:18.260
 and its reference points,

1:23:18.260 --> 1:23:23.260
 and having some intellectual diversity is really healthy.

1:23:24.020 --> 1:23:28.420
 People get each other unstuck, I think.

1:23:28.420 --> 1:23:30.620
 I see it all the time at DeepMind.

1:23:30.620 --> 1:23:33.060
 And I like to think that the people

1:23:33.060 --> 1:23:35.940
 who bring some neuroscience background to the table

1:23:35.940 --> 1:23:37.460
 are helping with that.

1:23:37.460 --> 1:23:41.420
 So one of my probably the deepest passion for me,

1:23:41.420 --> 1:23:44.140
 what I would say, maybe we kind of spoke off mic

1:23:44.140 --> 1:23:49.140
 a little bit about it, but that I think is a blind spot

1:23:49.460 --> 1:23:51.380
 for at least robotics and AI folks

1:23:51.380 --> 1:23:55.540
 is human robot interaction, human agent interaction.

1:23:55.540 --> 1:24:00.540
 Maybe do you have thoughts about how we reduce the size

1:24:01.860 --> 1:24:02.980
 of that blind spot?

1:24:02.980 --> 1:24:07.460
 Do you also share the feeling that not enough folks

1:24:07.460 --> 1:24:10.260
 are studying this aspect of interaction?

1:24:10.260 --> 1:24:14.540
 Well, I'm actually pretty intensively interested

1:24:14.540 --> 1:24:17.060
 in this issue now, and there are people in my group

1:24:17.060 --> 1:24:20.940
 who've actually pivoted pretty hard over the last few years

1:24:20.940 --> 1:24:24.180
 from doing more traditional cognitive psychology

1:24:24.180 --> 1:24:28.060
 and cognitive neuroscience to doing experimental work

1:24:28.060 --> 1:24:30.220
 on human agent interaction.

1:24:30.220 --> 1:24:33.700
 And there are a couple of reasons that I'm

1:24:33.700 --> 1:24:35.500
 pretty passionately interested in this.

1:24:35.500 --> 1:24:40.500
 One is it's kind of the outcome of having thought

1:24:42.460 --> 1:24:46.900
 for a few years now about what we're up to.

1:24:46.900 --> 1:24:49.340
 Like what are we doing?

1:24:49.340 --> 1:24:53.420
 Like what is this AI research for?

1:24:53.420 --> 1:24:57.020
 So what does it mean to make the world a better place?

1:24:57.020 --> 1:24:59.740
 I think I'm pretty sure that means making life better

1:24:59.740 --> 1:25:00.580
 for humans.

1:25:02.620 --> 1:25:05.820
 And so how do you make life better for humans?

1:25:05.820 --> 1:25:10.540
 That's a proposition that when you look at it carefully

1:25:10.540 --> 1:25:15.540
 and honestly is rather horrendously complicated,

1:25:15.860 --> 1:25:18.820
 especially when the AI systems

1:25:18.820 --> 1:25:23.820
 that you're building are learning systems.

1:25:25.220 --> 1:25:29.060
 They're not, you're not programming something

1:25:29.060 --> 1:25:31.420
 that you then introduce to the world

1:25:31.420 --> 1:25:33.140
 and it just works as programmed,

1:25:33.140 --> 1:25:34.860
 like Google Maps or something.

1:25:36.500 --> 1:25:39.700
 We're building systems that learn from experience.

1:25:39.700 --> 1:25:43.500
 So that typically leads to AI safety questions.

1:25:43.500 --> 1:25:45.420
 How do we keep these things from getting out of control?

1:25:45.420 --> 1:25:49.060
 How do we keep them from doing things that harm humans?

1:25:49.060 --> 1:25:51.820
 And I mean, I hasten to say,

1:25:51.820 --> 1:25:54.500
 I consider those hugely important issues.

1:25:54.500 --> 1:25:58.900
 And there are large sectors of the research community

1:25:58.900 --> 1:26:00.780
 at DeepMind and of course elsewhere

1:26:00.780 --> 1:26:03.460
 who are dedicated to thinking hard all day,

1:26:03.460 --> 1:26:04.980
 every day about that.

1:26:04.980 --> 1:26:09.620
 But there's, I guess I would say a positive side to this too

1:26:09.620 --> 1:26:13.300
 which is to say, well, what would it mean

1:26:13.300 --> 1:26:15.900
 to make human life better?

1:26:15.900 --> 1:26:20.140
 And how can we imagine learning systems doing that?

1:26:21.180 --> 1:26:23.500
 And in talking to my colleagues about that,

1:26:23.500 --> 1:26:25.700
 we reached the initial conclusion

1:26:25.700 --> 1:26:30.100
 that it's not sufficient to philosophize about that.

1:26:30.100 --> 1:26:32.060
 You actually have to take into account

1:26:32.060 --> 1:26:37.060
 how humans actually work and what humans want

1:26:37.860 --> 1:26:40.500
 and the difficulties of knowing what humans want

1:26:41.740 --> 1:26:43.780
 and the difficulties that arise

1:26:43.780 --> 1:26:46.340
 when humans want different things.

1:26:47.380 --> 1:26:50.900
 And so human agent interaction has become,

1:26:50.900 --> 1:26:55.060
 a quite intensive focus of my group lately.

1:26:56.460 --> 1:26:58.020
 If for no other reason that,

1:26:59.020 --> 1:27:04.020
 in order to really address that issue in an adequate way,

1:27:04.660 --> 1:27:07.340
 you have to, I mean, psychology becomes part of the picture.

1:27:07.340 --> 1:27:10.380
 Yeah, and so there's a few elements there.

1:27:10.380 --> 1:27:12.900
 So if you focus on solving like the,

1:27:12.900 --> 1:27:14.700
 if you focus on the robotics problem,

1:27:14.700 --> 1:27:18.140
 let's say AGI without humans in the picture

1:27:18.140 --> 1:27:22.300
 is you're missing fundamentally the final step.

1:27:22.300 --> 1:27:24.580
 When you do want to help human civilization,

1:27:24.580 --> 1:27:27.340
 you eventually have to interact with humans.

1:27:27.340 --> 1:27:31.380
 And when you create a learning system, just as you said,

1:27:31.380 --> 1:27:34.340
 that will eventually have to interact with humans,

1:27:34.340 --> 1:27:37.900
 the interaction itself has to be become,

1:27:37.900 --> 1:27:40.780
 has to become part of the learning process.

1:27:40.780 --> 1:27:43.820
 So you can't just watch, well, my sense is,

1:27:43.820 --> 1:27:46.580
 it sounds like your sense is you can't just watch humans

1:27:46.580 --> 1:27:48.260
 to learn about humans.

1:27:48.260 --> 1:27:50.220
 You have to also be part of the human world.

1:27:50.220 --> 1:27:51.420
 You have to interact with humans.

1:27:51.420 --> 1:27:52.260
 Yeah, exactly.

1:27:52.260 --> 1:27:57.260
 And I mean, then questions arise that start imperceptibly,

1:27:57.380 --> 1:28:02.380
 but inevitably to slip beyond the realm of engineering.

1:28:02.380 --> 1:28:05.940
 So questions like, if you have an agent

1:28:05.940 --> 1:28:08.940
 that can do something that you can't do,

1:28:10.900 --> 1:28:13.780
 under what conditions do you want that agent to do it?

1:28:13.780 --> 1:28:18.780
 So if I have a robot that can play Beethoven sonatas

1:28:24.700 --> 1:28:29.700
 better than any human, in the sense that the sensitivity,

1:28:30.740 --> 1:28:33.940
 the expression is just beyond what any human,

1:28:33.940 --> 1:28:36.300
 do I want to listen to that?

1:28:36.300 --> 1:28:38.780
 Do I want to go to a concert and hear a robot play?

1:28:38.780 --> 1:28:41.340
 These aren't engineering questions.

1:28:41.340 --> 1:28:44.340
 These are questions about human preference

1:28:44.340 --> 1:28:45.980
 and human culture.

1:28:45.980 --> 1:28:47.940
 Psychology bordering on philosophy.

1:28:47.940 --> 1:28:50.260
 Yeah, and then you start asking,

1:28:50.260 --> 1:28:54.660
 well, even if we knew the answer to that,

1:28:54.660 --> 1:28:57.060
 is it our place as AI engineers

1:28:57.060 --> 1:28:59.180
 to build that into these agents?

1:28:59.180 --> 1:29:02.140
 Probably the agents should interact with humans

1:29:03.500 --> 1:29:05.620
 beyond the population of AI engineers

1:29:05.620 --> 1:29:07.820
 and figure out what those humans want.

1:29:08.780 --> 1:29:10.620
 And then when you start,

1:29:10.620 --> 1:29:11.780
 I referred this the moment ago,

1:29:11.780 --> 1:29:14.340
 but even that becomes complicated.

1:29:14.340 --> 1:29:19.100
 Be quote, what if two humans want different things?

1:29:19.100 --> 1:29:22.380
 And you have only one agent that's able to interact with them

1:29:22.380 --> 1:29:24.620
 and try to satisfy their preferences.

1:29:24.620 --> 1:29:27.060
 Then you're into the realm of economics

1:29:30.340 --> 1:29:33.660
 and social choice theory and even politics.

1:29:33.660 --> 1:29:35.540
 So there's a sense in which,

1:29:35.540 --> 1:29:37.980
 if you kind of follow what we're doing

1:29:37.980 --> 1:29:39.940
 to its logical conclusion,

1:29:39.940 --> 1:29:44.940
 then it goes beyond questions of engineering and technology

1:29:45.060 --> 1:29:48.420
 and starts to shade imperceptibly into questions

1:29:48.420 --> 1:29:51.660
 about what kind of society do you want?

1:29:51.660 --> 1:29:55.740
 And actually, once that dawned on me,

1:29:55.740 --> 1:29:57.300
 I actually felt,

1:29:58.620 --> 1:29:59.860
 I don't know what the right word is,

1:29:59.860 --> 1:30:03.020
 quite refreshed in my involvement in AI research.

1:30:03.020 --> 1:30:06.300
 It was almost like building this kind of stuff

1:30:06.300 --> 1:30:10.220
 is gonna lead us back to asking really fundamental questions

1:30:10.220 --> 1:30:13.860
 about what is this,

1:30:13.860 --> 1:30:16.700
 what's the good life and who gets to decide

1:30:16.700 --> 1:30:21.700
 and bringing in viewpoints from multiple sub communities

1:30:23.780 --> 1:30:26.300
 to help us shape the way that we live.

1:30:27.460 --> 1:30:30.820
 There's something, it started making me feel like

1:30:30.820 --> 1:30:36.300
 doing AI research in a fully responsible way, would,

1:30:38.300 --> 1:30:42.820
 could potentially lead to a kind of like cultural renewal.

1:30:42.820 --> 1:30:47.820
 Yeah, it's the way to understand human beings

1:30:48.180 --> 1:30:50.340
 at the individual, at the societal level.

1:30:50.340 --> 1:30:54.020
 It may become a way to answer all the silly human questions

1:30:54.020 --> 1:30:57.060
 of the meaning of life and all those kinds of things.

1:30:57.060 --> 1:30:58.060
 Even if it doesn't give us a way

1:30:58.060 --> 1:30:59.220
 of answering those questions,

1:30:59.220 --> 1:31:03.660
 it may force us back to thinking about them.

1:31:03.660 --> 1:31:06.940
 And it might bring, it might restore a certain,

1:31:06.940 --> 1:31:10.460
 I don't know, a certain depth to,

1:31:10.460 --> 1:31:15.460
 or even dare I say spirituality to the way that,

1:31:16.380 --> 1:31:18.060
 to the world, I don't know.

1:31:18.060 --> 1:31:19.380
 Maybe that's too grandiose.

1:31:19.380 --> 1:31:21.020
 Well, I'm with you.

1:31:21.020 --> 1:31:26.020
 I think it's AI will be the philosophy of the 21st century,

1:31:27.620 --> 1:31:29.020
 the way which will open the door.

1:31:29.020 --> 1:31:32.500
 I think a lot of AI researchers are afraid to open that door

1:31:32.500 --> 1:31:35.660
 of exploring the beautiful richness

1:31:35.660 --> 1:31:39.540
 of the human agent interaction, human AI interaction.

1:31:39.540 --> 1:31:42.380
 I'm really happy that somebody like you

1:31:42.380 --> 1:31:43.700
 have opened that door.

1:31:43.700 --> 1:31:48.700
 And one thing I often think about is the usual schema

1:31:49.500 --> 1:31:54.500
 for thinking about human agent interaction

1:31:54.500 --> 1:31:59.500
 as this kind of dystopian, oh, our robot overlords.

1:32:00.460 --> 1:32:03.500
 And again, I hasten to say AI safety is hugely important.

1:32:03.500 --> 1:32:06.420
 And I'm not saying we shouldn't be thinking

1:32:06.420 --> 1:32:09.540
 about those risks, totally on board for that.

1:32:09.540 --> 1:32:14.060
 But there's, having said that,

1:32:17.060 --> 1:32:18.860
 what often follows for me is the thought

1:32:18.860 --> 1:32:22.980
 that there's another kind of narrative

1:32:22.980 --> 1:32:24.780
 that might be relevant, which is,

1:32:24.780 --> 1:32:29.780
 when we think of humans gaining more and more information

1:32:31.020 --> 1:32:36.020
 about human life, the narrative there is usually

1:32:36.380 --> 1:32:38.540
 that they gain more and more wisdom

1:32:38.540 --> 1:32:40.700
 and they get closer to enlightenment

1:32:40.700 --> 1:32:43.260
 and they become more benevolent.

1:32:43.260 --> 1:32:47.300
 And the Buddha is like, that's a totally different narrative.

1:32:47.300 --> 1:32:50.380
 And why isn't it the case that we imagine

1:32:50.380 --> 1:32:52.460
 that the AI systems that we're creating

1:32:52.460 --> 1:32:53.980
 are just gonna, like, they're gonna figure out

1:32:53.980 --> 1:32:55.660
 more and more about the way the world works

1:32:55.660 --> 1:32:56.820
 and the way that humans interact

1:32:56.820 --> 1:32:59.180
 and they'll become beneficent.

1:32:59.180 --> 1:33:00.500
 I'm not saying that will happen.

1:33:00.500 --> 1:33:05.420
 I don't honestly expect that to happen

1:33:05.420 --> 1:33:08.820
 without some careful, setting things up very carefully.

1:33:08.820 --> 1:33:11.340
 But it's another way things could go, right?

1:33:11.340 --> 1:33:13.820
 And yeah, and I would even push back on that.

1:33:13.820 --> 1:33:18.820
 I personally believe that the most trajectories,

1:33:18.820 --> 1:33:23.820
 natural human trajectories will lead us towards progress.

1:33:25.460 --> 1:33:28.420
 So for me, there is a kind of sense

1:33:28.420 --> 1:33:30.820
 that most trajectories in AI development

1:33:30.820 --> 1:33:32.540
 will lead us into trouble.

1:33:32.540 --> 1:33:37.140
 To me, and we over focus on the worst case.

1:33:37.140 --> 1:33:38.500
 It's like in computer science,

1:33:38.500 --> 1:33:40.860
 theoretical computer science has been this focus

1:33:40.860 --> 1:33:42.060
 on worst case analysis.

1:33:42.060 --> 1:33:45.180
 There's something appealing to our human mind

1:33:45.180 --> 1:33:47.660
 at some lowest level to be good.

1:33:47.660 --> 1:33:50.220
 I mean, we don't wanna be eaten by the tiger, I guess.

1:33:50.220 --> 1:33:52.300
 So we wanna do the worst case analysis.

1:33:52.300 --> 1:33:55.660
 But the reality is that shouldn't stop us

1:33:55.660 --> 1:33:58.620
 from actually building out all the other trajectories

1:33:58.620 --> 1:34:01.900
 which are potentially leading to all the positive worlds,

1:34:01.900 --> 1:34:04.540
 all the enlightenment.

1:34:04.540 --> 1:34:05.700
 There's a book, Enlightenment Now,

1:34:05.700 --> 1:34:06.980
 with Steven Pinker and so on.

1:34:06.980 --> 1:34:09.660
 This is looking generally at human progress.

1:34:09.660 --> 1:34:12.300
 And there's so many ways that human progress

1:34:12.300 --> 1:34:13.900
 can happen with AI.

1:34:13.900 --> 1:34:16.300
 And I think you have to do that research.

1:34:16.300 --> 1:34:17.380
 You have to do that work.

1:34:17.380 --> 1:34:20.700
 You have to do the, not just the AI safety work

1:34:20.700 --> 1:34:22.500
 of the one worst case analysis.

1:34:22.500 --> 1:34:23.500
 How do we prevent that?

1:34:23.500 --> 1:34:27.540
 But the actual tools and the glue

1:34:27.540 --> 1:34:31.340
 and the mechanisms of human AI interaction

1:34:31.340 --> 1:34:34.180
 that would lead to all the positive actions that can go.

1:34:34.180 --> 1:34:36.540
 It's a super exciting area, right?

1:34:36.540 --> 1:34:38.340
 Yeah, we should be spending,

1:34:38.340 --> 1:34:40.820
 we should be spending a lot of our time saying

1:34:40.820 --> 1:34:42.860
 what can go wrong.

1:34:42.860 --> 1:34:47.860
 I think it's harder to see that there's work to be done

1:34:47.860 --> 1:34:51.540
 to bring into focus the question of what it would look like

1:34:51.540 --> 1:34:52.980
 for things to go right.

1:34:54.420 --> 1:34:56.500
 That's not obvious.

1:34:57.660 --> 1:34:59.620
 And we wouldn't be doing this if we didn't have the sense

1:34:59.620 --> 1:35:01.980
 there was huge potential, right?

1:35:01.980 --> 1:35:05.100
 We're not doing this for no reason.

1:35:05.100 --> 1:35:10.100
 We have a sense that AGI would be a major boom to humanity.

1:35:10.100 --> 1:35:13.700
 But I think it's worth starting now,

1:35:13.700 --> 1:35:15.620
 even when our technology is quite primitive,

1:35:15.620 --> 1:35:19.420
 asking exactly what would that mean?

1:35:19.420 --> 1:35:21.060
 We can start now with applications

1:35:21.060 --> 1:35:22.580
 that are already gonna make the world a better place,

1:35:22.580 --> 1:35:25.060
 like solving protein folding.

1:35:25.060 --> 1:35:27.860
 I think DeepMind has gotten heavy

1:35:27.860 --> 1:35:30.060
 into science applications lately,

1:35:30.060 --> 1:35:34.380
 which I think is a wonderful, wonderful move

1:35:34.380 --> 1:35:36.060
 for us to be making.

1:35:36.060 --> 1:35:37.260
 But when we think about AGI,

1:35:37.260 --> 1:35:39.860
 when we think about building fully intelligent

1:35:39.860 --> 1:35:42.460
 agents that are gonna be able to, in a sense,

1:35:42.460 --> 1:35:43.780
 do whatever they want,

1:35:45.540 --> 1:35:46.740
 we should start thinking about

1:35:46.740 --> 1:35:48.940
 what do we want them to want, right?

1:35:48.940 --> 1:35:51.460
 What kind of world do we wanna live in?

1:35:52.300 --> 1:35:54.300
 That's not an easy question.

1:35:54.300 --> 1:35:56.700
 And I think we just need to start working on it.

1:35:56.700 --> 1:35:58.620
 And even on the path to,

1:35:58.620 --> 1:35:59.900
 it doesn't have to be AGI,

1:35:59.900 --> 1:36:02.300
 but just intelligent agents that interact with us

1:36:02.300 --> 1:36:06.220
 and help us enrich our own existence on social networks,

1:36:06.220 --> 1:36:08.820
 for example, on recommender systems of various intelligence.

1:36:08.820 --> 1:36:10.540
 And there's so much interesting interaction

1:36:10.540 --> 1:36:12.300
 that's yet to be understood and studied.

1:36:12.300 --> 1:36:15.540
 And how do you create,

1:36:15.540 --> 1:36:19.460
 I mean, Twitter is struggling with this very idea,

1:36:19.460 --> 1:36:21.420
 how do you create AI systems

1:36:21.420 --> 1:36:24.380
 that increase the quality and the health of a conversation?

1:36:24.380 --> 1:36:25.220
 For sure.

1:36:25.220 --> 1:36:28.500
 That's a beautiful human psychology question.

1:36:28.500 --> 1:36:29.740
 And how do you do that

1:36:29.740 --> 1:36:34.740
 without deception being involved,

1:36:34.740 --> 1:36:38.100
 without manipulation being involved,

1:36:38.100 --> 1:36:41.060
 maximizing human autonomy?

1:36:42.420 --> 1:36:45.820
 And how do you make these choices in a democratic way?

1:36:45.820 --> 1:36:50.180
 How do we face the,

1:36:50.180 --> 1:36:52.740
 again, I'm speaking for myself here.

1:36:52.740 --> 1:36:54.660
 How do we face the fact that

1:36:55.700 --> 1:36:57.740
 it's a small group of people

1:36:57.740 --> 1:37:01.340
 who have the skillset to build these kinds of systems,

1:37:01.340 --> 1:37:05.860
 but what it means to make the world a better place

1:37:05.860 --> 1:37:09.020
 is something that we all have to be talking about.

1:37:09.020 --> 1:37:14.020
 Yeah, the world that we're trying to make a better place

1:37:14.020 --> 1:37:18.020
 includes a huge variety of different kinds of people.

1:37:18.020 --> 1:37:19.420
 Yeah, how do we cope with that?

1:37:19.420 --> 1:37:22.820
 This is a problem that has been discussed

1:37:22.820 --> 1:37:27.820
 in gory, extensive detail in social choice theory.

1:37:28.500 --> 1:37:29.900
 One thing I'm really interested in

1:37:29.900 --> 1:37:32.900
 and one thing I'm really enjoying

1:37:32.900 --> 1:37:35.180
 about the recent direction work has taken

1:37:35.180 --> 1:37:36.900
 in some parts of my team is that,

1:37:36.900 --> 1:37:38.620
 yeah, we're reading the AI literature,

1:37:38.620 --> 1:37:39.940
 we're reading the neuroscience literature,

1:37:39.940 --> 1:37:42.940
 but we've also started reading economics

1:37:42.940 --> 1:37:44.820
 and, as I mentioned, social choice theory,

1:37:44.820 --> 1:37:45.940
 even some political theory,

1:37:45.940 --> 1:37:50.380
 because it turns out that it all becomes relevant.

1:37:50.380 --> 1:37:51.580
 It all becomes relevant.

1:37:53.540 --> 1:37:55.660
 But at the same time,

1:37:55.660 --> 1:38:00.140
 we've been trying not to write philosophy papers,

1:38:00.140 --> 1:38:01.980
 we've been trying not to write physician papers.

1:38:01.980 --> 1:38:03.780
 We're trying to figure out ways

1:38:03.780 --> 1:38:05.740
 of doing actual empirical research

1:38:05.740 --> 1:38:07.780
 that kind of take the first small steps

1:38:07.780 --> 1:38:10.820
 to thinking about what it really means

1:38:10.820 --> 1:38:13.580
 for humans with all of their complexity

1:38:13.580 --> 1:38:16.980
 and contradiction and paradox

1:38:18.540 --> 1:38:22.340
 to be brought into contact with these AI systems

1:38:22.340 --> 1:38:25.540
 in a way that really makes the world a better place.

1:38:25.540 --> 1:38:27.540
 Often, reinforcement learning frameworks

1:38:27.540 --> 1:38:30.860
 actually kind of allow you to do that,

1:38:30.860 --> 1:38:33.580
 machine learning, and so that's the exciting thing about AI

1:38:33.580 --> 1:38:37.260
 is it allows you to reduce the unsolvable problem,

1:38:37.260 --> 1:38:40.380
 philosophical problem, into something more concrete

1:38:40.380 --> 1:38:41.700
 that you can get ahold of.

1:38:41.700 --> 1:38:43.900
 Yeah, and it allows you to kind of define the problem

1:38:43.900 --> 1:38:48.900
 in some way that allows for growth in the system

1:38:49.980 --> 1:38:51.140
 that's sort of, you know,

1:38:51.140 --> 1:38:54.100
 you're not responsible for the details, right?

1:38:54.100 --> 1:38:56.700
 You say, this is generally what I want you to do,

1:38:56.700 --> 1:38:58.740
 and then learning takes care of the rest.

1:38:59.580 --> 1:39:04.100
 Of course, the safety issues arise in that context,

1:39:04.100 --> 1:39:05.980
 but I think also some of these positive issues

1:39:05.980 --> 1:39:06.940
 arise in that context.

1:39:06.940 --> 1:39:09.180
 What would it mean for an AI system

1:39:09.180 --> 1:39:12.700
 to really come to understand what humans want?

1:39:14.780 --> 1:39:18.940
 And with all of the subtleties of that, right?

1:39:18.940 --> 1:39:23.940
 You know, humans want help with certain things,

1:39:24.660 --> 1:39:27.420
 but they don't want everything done for them, right?

1:39:27.420 --> 1:39:29.660
 There is, part of the satisfaction

1:39:29.660 --> 1:39:32.700
 that humans get from life is in accomplishing things.

1:39:32.700 --> 1:39:34.660
 So if there were devices around that did everything for,

1:39:34.660 --> 1:39:37.500
 you know, I often think of the movie WALLI, right?

1:39:37.500 --> 1:39:39.380
 That's like dystopian in a totally different way.

1:39:39.380 --> 1:39:41.340
 It's like, the machines are doing everything for us.

1:39:41.340 --> 1:39:43.780
 That's not what we wanted.

1:39:43.780 --> 1:39:46.700
 You know, anyway, I find this, you know,

1:39:46.700 --> 1:39:50.500
 this opens up a whole landscape of research

1:39:50.500 --> 1:39:52.740
 that feels affirmative and exciting.

1:39:52.740 --> 1:39:56.020
 To me, it's one of the most exciting, and it's wide open.

1:39:56.020 --> 1:39:58.260
 We have to, because it's a cool paper,

1:39:58.260 --> 1:39:59.300
 talk about dopamine.

1:39:59.300 --> 1:40:01.100
 Oh yeah, okay, so I can.

1:40:01.100 --> 1:40:04.980
 We were gonna, I was gonna give you a quick summary.

1:40:04.980 --> 1:40:09.900
 Yeah, a quick summary of, what's the title of the paper?

1:40:09.900 --> 1:40:14.900
 I think we called it a distributional code for value

1:40:14.900 --> 1:40:19.020
 in dopamine based reinforcement learning, yes.

1:40:19.020 --> 1:40:24.020
 So that's another project that grew out of pure AI research.

1:40:25.740 --> 1:40:29.620
 A number of people at DeepMind and a few other places

1:40:29.620 --> 1:40:32.340
 had started working on a new version

1:40:32.340 --> 1:40:33.740
 of reinforcement learning,

1:40:35.740 --> 1:40:38.940
 which was defined by taking something

1:40:38.940 --> 1:40:41.420
 in traditional reinforcement learning and just tweaking it.

1:40:41.420 --> 1:40:42.740
 So the thing that they took

1:40:42.740 --> 1:40:46.860
 from traditional reinforcement learning was a value signal.

1:40:46.860 --> 1:40:49.540
 So at the center of reinforcement learning,

1:40:49.540 --> 1:40:52.580
 at least most algorithms, is some representation

1:40:52.580 --> 1:40:54.140
 of how well things are going,

1:40:54.140 --> 1:40:57.660
 your expected cumulative future reward.

1:40:57.660 --> 1:41:01.220
 And that's usually represented as a single number.

1:41:01.220 --> 1:41:04.260
 So if you imagine a gambler in a casino

1:41:04.260 --> 1:41:07.980
 and the gambler's thinking, well, I have this probability

1:41:07.980 --> 1:41:09.540
 of winning such and such an amount of money,

1:41:09.540 --> 1:41:11.260
 and I have this probability of losing such and such

1:41:11.260 --> 1:41:14.860
 an amount of money, that situation would be represented

1:41:14.860 --> 1:41:17.260
 as a single number, which is like the expected,

1:41:17.260 --> 1:41:19.580
 the weighted average of all those outcomes.

1:41:20.580 --> 1:41:23.740
 And this new form of reinforcement learning said,

1:41:23.740 --> 1:41:26.460
 well, what if we generalize that

1:41:26.460 --> 1:41:28.140
 to a distributional representation?

1:41:28.140 --> 1:41:30.820
 So now we think of the gambler as literally thinking,

1:41:30.820 --> 1:41:32.260
 well, there's this probability

1:41:32.260 --> 1:41:33.620
 that I'll win this amount of money,

1:41:33.620 --> 1:41:34.580
 and there's this probability

1:41:34.580 --> 1:41:35.700
 that I'll lose that amount of money,

1:41:35.700 --> 1:41:37.820
 and we don't reduce that to a single number.

1:41:37.820 --> 1:41:40.580
 And it had been observed through experiments,

1:41:40.580 --> 1:41:42.420
 through just trying this out,

1:41:42.420 --> 1:41:45.900
 that that kind of distributional representation

1:41:45.900 --> 1:41:49.620
 really accelerated reinforcement learning

1:41:49.620 --> 1:41:52.380
 and led to better policies.

1:41:52.380 --> 1:41:53.620
 What's your intuition about,

1:41:53.620 --> 1:41:55.260
 so we're talking about rewards.

1:41:55.260 --> 1:41:56.100
 Yeah.

1:41:56.100 --> 1:41:58.420
 So what's your intuition why that is, why does it do that?

1:41:58.420 --> 1:42:02.620
 Well, it's kind of a surprising historical note,

1:42:02.620 --> 1:42:04.460
 at least surprised me when I learned it,

1:42:04.460 --> 1:42:07.260
 that this had been proven to be true.

1:42:07.260 --> 1:42:09.820
 This had been tried out in a kind of heuristic way.

1:42:09.820 --> 1:42:12.500
 People thought, well, gee, what would happen if we tried?

1:42:12.500 --> 1:42:14.580
 And then it had this, empirically,

1:42:14.580 --> 1:42:17.300
 it had this striking effect.

1:42:17.300 --> 1:42:19.300
 And it was only then that people started thinking,

1:42:19.300 --> 1:42:21.380
 well, gee, wait, why?

1:42:21.380 --> 1:42:22.220
 Wait, why?

1:42:22.220 --> 1:42:23.420
 Why is this working?

1:42:23.420 --> 1:42:26.180
 And that's led to a series of studies

1:42:26.180 --> 1:42:29.740
 just trying to figure out why it works, which is ongoing.

1:42:29.740 --> 1:42:31.780
 But one thing that's already clear from that research

1:42:31.780 --> 1:42:34.340
 is that one reason that it helps

1:42:34.340 --> 1:42:38.300
 is that it drives richer representation learning.

1:42:39.420 --> 1:42:43.060
 So if you imagine two situations

1:42:43.060 --> 1:42:45.300
 that have the same expected value,

1:42:45.300 --> 1:42:47.300
 the same kind of weighted average value,

1:42:48.980 --> 1:42:51.300
 standard deep reinforcement learning algorithms

1:42:51.300 --> 1:42:53.500
 are going to take those two situations

1:42:53.500 --> 1:42:55.020
 and kind of, in terms of the way

1:42:55.020 --> 1:42:56.460
 they're represented internally,

1:42:56.460 --> 1:42:58.180
 they're gonna squeeze them together

1:42:58.180 --> 1:43:02.580
 because the thing that you're trying to represent,

1:43:02.580 --> 1:43:04.180
 which is their expected value, is the same.

1:43:04.180 --> 1:43:06.260
 So all the way through the system,

1:43:06.260 --> 1:43:08.420
 things are gonna be mushed together.

1:43:08.420 --> 1:43:11.060
 But what if those two situations

1:43:11.060 --> 1:43:13.940
 actually have different value distributions?

1:43:13.940 --> 1:43:16.900
 They have the same average value,

1:43:16.900 --> 1:43:19.900
 but they have different distributions of value.

1:43:19.900 --> 1:43:22.300
 In that situation, distributional learning

1:43:22.300 --> 1:43:25.100
 will maintain the distinction between these two things.

1:43:25.100 --> 1:43:26.820
 So to make a long story short,

1:43:26.820 --> 1:43:30.020
 distributional learning can keep things separate

1:43:30.020 --> 1:43:32.180
 in the internal representation

1:43:32.180 --> 1:43:35.140
 that might otherwise be conflated or squished together.

1:43:35.140 --> 1:43:36.380
 And maintaining those distinctions

1:43:36.380 --> 1:43:40.180
 can be useful when the system is now faced

1:43:40.180 --> 1:43:43.260
 with some other task where the distinction is important.

1:43:43.260 --> 1:43:44.540
 If we look at the optimistic

1:43:44.540 --> 1:43:46.580
 and pessimistic dopamine neurons.

1:43:46.580 --> 1:43:49.580
 So first of all, what is dopamine?

1:43:50.900 --> 1:43:51.740
 Oh, God.

1:43:51.740 --> 1:43:54.740
 Why is this at all useful

1:43:58.220 --> 1:44:00.740
 to think about in the artificial intelligence sense?

1:44:00.740 --> 1:44:04.180
 But what do we know about dopamine in the human brain?

1:44:04.180 --> 1:44:05.620
 What is it?

1:44:05.620 --> 1:44:06.460
 Why is it useful?

1:44:06.460 --> 1:44:07.460
 Why is it interesting?

1:44:07.460 --> 1:44:09.380
 What does it have to do with the prefrontal cortex

1:44:09.380 --> 1:44:10.260
 and learning in general?

1:44:10.260 --> 1:44:15.260
 Yeah, so, well, this is also a case

1:44:15.540 --> 1:44:19.660
 where there's a huge amount of detail and debate.

1:44:19.660 --> 1:44:24.660
 But one currently prevailing idea

1:44:24.740 --> 1:44:29.060
 is that the function of this neurotransmitter dopamine

1:44:29.060 --> 1:44:33.460
 resembles a particular component

1:44:33.460 --> 1:44:36.860
 of standard reinforcement learning algorithms,

1:44:36.860 --> 1:44:39.860
 which is called the reward prediction error.

1:44:39.860 --> 1:44:41.580
 So I was talking a moment ago

1:44:41.580 --> 1:44:44.220
 about these value representations.

1:44:44.220 --> 1:44:45.180
 How do you learn them?

1:44:45.180 --> 1:44:46.900
 How do you update them based on experience?

1:44:46.900 --> 1:44:51.820
 Well, if you made some prediction about a future reward

1:44:51.820 --> 1:44:54.460
 and then you get more reward than you were expecting,

1:44:54.460 --> 1:44:56.020
 then probably retrospectively,

1:44:56.020 --> 1:45:00.740
 you want to go back and increase the value representation

1:45:00.740 --> 1:45:03.820
 that you attached to that earlier situation.

1:45:03.820 --> 1:45:06.180
 If you got less reward than you were expecting,

1:45:06.180 --> 1:45:08.540
 you should probably decrement that estimate.

1:45:08.540 --> 1:45:10.300
 And that's the process of temporal difference.

1:45:10.300 --> 1:45:12.020
 Exactly, this is the central mechanism

1:45:12.020 --> 1:45:12.860
 of temporal difference learning,

1:45:12.860 --> 1:45:17.660
 which is one of several sort of the backbone

1:45:17.660 --> 1:45:20.420
 of our momentarium in NRL.

1:45:20.420 --> 1:45:25.020
 And this connection between the reward prediction error

1:45:25.020 --> 1:45:30.020
 and dopamine was made in the 1990s.

1:45:31.940 --> 1:45:33.420
 And there's been a huge amount of research

1:45:33.420 --> 1:45:35.860
 that seems to back it up.

1:45:35.860 --> 1:45:37.340
 Dopamine may be doing other things,

1:45:37.340 --> 1:45:39.860
 but this is clearly, at least roughly,

1:45:39.860 --> 1:45:42.460
 one of the things that it's doing.

1:45:42.460 --> 1:45:45.100
 But the usual idea was that dopamine

1:45:45.100 --> 1:45:48.060
 was representing these reward prediction errors,

1:45:48.060 --> 1:45:51.340
 again, in this like kind of single number way

1:45:51.340 --> 1:45:56.340
 that representing your surprise with a single number.

1:45:56.700 --> 1:45:58.500
 And in distributional reinforcement learning,

1:45:58.500 --> 1:46:02.780
 this kind of new elaboration of the standard approach,

1:46:03.660 --> 1:46:06.060
 it's not only the value function

1:46:06.060 --> 1:46:08.460
 that's represented as a single number,

1:46:08.460 --> 1:46:10.940
 it's also the reward prediction error.

1:46:10.940 --> 1:46:15.940
 And so what happened was that Will Dabney,

1:46:16.180 --> 1:46:18.980
 one of my collaborators who was one of the first people

1:46:18.980 --> 1:46:22.300
 to work on distributional temporal difference learning,

1:46:22.300 --> 1:46:25.740
 talked to a guy in my group, Zeb Kurt Nelson,

1:46:25.740 --> 1:46:27.660
 who's a computational neuroscientist,

1:46:27.660 --> 1:46:29.580
 and said, gee, you know, is it possible

1:46:29.580 --> 1:46:31.740
 that dopamine might be doing something

1:46:31.740 --> 1:46:33.420
 like this distributional coding thing?

1:46:33.420 --> 1:46:35.980
 And they started looking at what was in the literature,

1:46:35.980 --> 1:46:36.820
 and then they brought me in,

1:46:36.820 --> 1:46:39.220
 and we started talking to Nao Uchida,

1:46:39.220 --> 1:46:41.300
 and we came up with some specific predictions

1:46:41.300 --> 1:46:43.500
 about if the brain is using

1:46:43.500 --> 1:46:45.140
 this kind of distributional coding,

1:46:45.140 --> 1:46:47.340
 then in the tasks that Nao has studied,

1:46:47.340 --> 1:46:49.300
 you should see this, this, this, and this,

1:46:49.300 --> 1:46:50.620
 and that's where the paper came from.

1:46:50.620 --> 1:46:53.540
 We kind of enumerated a set of predictions,

1:46:53.540 --> 1:46:56.420
 all of which ended up being fairly clearly confirmed,

1:46:57.260 --> 1:47:00.740
 and all of which leads to at least some initial indication

1:47:00.740 --> 1:47:02.180
 that the brain might be doing something

1:47:02.180 --> 1:47:03.420
 like this distributional coding,

1:47:03.420 --> 1:47:06.780
 that dopamine might be representing surprise signals

1:47:06.780 --> 1:47:09.980
 in a way that is not just collapsing everything

1:47:09.980 --> 1:47:12.180
 to a single number, but instead is kind of respecting

1:47:12.180 --> 1:47:16.620
 the variety of future outcomes, if that makes sense.

1:47:16.620 --> 1:47:19.580
 So yeah, so that's showing, suggesting possibly

1:47:19.580 --> 1:47:21.900
 that dopamine has a really interesting

1:47:21.900 --> 1:47:25.940
 representation scheme in the human brain

1:47:25.940 --> 1:47:27.660
 for its reward signal.

1:47:27.660 --> 1:47:29.660
 Exactly. That's fascinating.

1:47:29.660 --> 1:47:32.140
 That's another beautiful example of AI

1:47:32.140 --> 1:47:34.460
 revealing something nice about neuroscience,

1:47:34.460 --> 1:47:36.260
 potentially suggesting possibilities.

1:47:36.260 --> 1:47:37.100
 Well, you never know.

1:47:37.100 --> 1:47:39.260
 So the minute you publish a paper like that,

1:47:39.260 --> 1:47:42.620
 the next thing you think is, I hope that replicates.

1:47:42.620 --> 1:47:44.940
 Like, I hope we see that same thing in other data sets,

1:47:44.940 --> 1:47:47.380
 but of course, several labs now

1:47:47.380 --> 1:47:50.180
 are doing the followup experiments, so we'll know soon.

1:47:50.180 --> 1:47:52.580
 But it has been a lot of fun for us

1:47:52.580 --> 1:47:54.780
 to take these ideas from AI

1:47:54.780 --> 1:47:56.820
 and kind of bring them into neuroscience

1:47:56.820 --> 1:47:58.980
 and see how far we can get.

1:47:58.980 --> 1:48:01.300
 So we kind of talked about it a little bit,

1:48:01.300 --> 1:48:04.020
 but where do you see the field of neuroscience

1:48:04.020 --> 1:48:07.740
 and artificial intelligence heading broadly?

1:48:07.740 --> 1:48:12.580
 Like, what are the possible exciting areas

1:48:12.580 --> 1:48:15.300
 that you can see breakthroughs in the next,

1:48:15.300 --> 1:48:17.980
 let's get crazy, not just three or five years,

1:48:17.980 --> 1:48:20.020
 but the next 10, 20, 30 years

1:48:22.340 --> 1:48:26.100
 that would make you excited

1:48:26.100 --> 1:48:27.980
 and perhaps you'd be part of?

1:48:29.020 --> 1:48:31.020
 On the neuroscience side,

1:48:32.980 --> 1:48:34.420
 there's a great deal of interest now

1:48:34.420 --> 1:48:36.780
 in what's going on in AI.

1:48:36.780 --> 1:48:41.500
 And at the same time,

1:48:41.500 --> 1:48:45.900
 I feel like, so neuroscience,

1:48:45.900 --> 1:48:50.100
 especially the part of neuroscience

1:48:50.100 --> 1:48:54.180
 that's focused on circuits and systems,

1:48:54.180 --> 1:48:56.340
 kind of like really mechanism focused,

1:48:57.780 --> 1:49:01.980
 there's been this explosion in new technology.

1:49:01.980 --> 1:49:05.100
 And up until recently,

1:49:05.100 --> 1:49:08.940
 the experiments that have exploited this technology

1:49:08.940 --> 1:49:13.340
 have not involved a lot of interesting behavior.

1:49:13.340 --> 1:49:15.420
 And this is for a variety of reasons,

1:49:16.300 --> 1:49:18.700
 one of which is in order to employ

1:49:18.700 --> 1:49:19.860
 some of these technologies,

1:49:19.860 --> 1:49:22.260
 you actually have to, if you're studying a mouse,

1:49:22.260 --> 1:49:23.620
 you have to head fix the mouse.

1:49:23.620 --> 1:49:26.260
 In other words, you have to like immobilize the mouse.

1:49:26.260 --> 1:49:28.700
 And so it's been tricky to come up

1:49:28.700 --> 1:49:30.860
 with ways of eliciting interesting behavior

1:49:30.860 --> 1:49:33.460
 from a mouse that's restrained in this way,

1:49:33.460 --> 1:49:35.660
 but people have begun to create

1:49:35.660 --> 1:49:39.460
 very interesting solutions to this,

1:49:39.460 --> 1:49:41.300
 like virtual reality environments

1:49:41.300 --> 1:49:43.860
 where the animal can kind of move a track ball.

1:49:43.860 --> 1:49:48.780
 And as people have kind of begun to explore

1:49:48.780 --> 1:49:50.260
 what you can do with these technologies,

1:49:50.260 --> 1:49:52.820
 I feel like more and more people are asking,

1:49:52.820 --> 1:49:55.740
 well, let's try to bring behavior into the picture.

1:49:55.740 --> 1:49:58.220
 Let's try to like reintroduce behavior,

1:49:58.220 --> 1:50:01.020
 which was supposed to be what this whole thing was about.

1:50:01.020 --> 1:50:05.700
 And I'm hoping that those two trends,

1:50:05.700 --> 1:50:09.180
 the kind of growing interest in behavior

1:50:09.180 --> 1:50:14.180
 and the widespread interest in what's going on in AI,

1:50:14.180 --> 1:50:17.580
 will come together to kind of open a new chapter

1:50:17.580 --> 1:50:22.580
 in neuroscience research where there's a kind of

1:50:22.580 --> 1:50:25.820
 a rebirth of interest in the structure of behavior

1:50:25.820 --> 1:50:27.540
 and its underlying substrates,

1:50:27.540 --> 1:50:31.340
 but that that research is being informed

1:50:31.340 --> 1:50:33.700
 by computational mechanisms

1:50:33.700 --> 1:50:35.620
 that we're coming to understand in AI.

1:50:36.740 --> 1:50:39.580
 If we can do that, then we might be taking a step closer

1:50:39.580 --> 1:50:43.260
 to this utopian future that we were talking about earlier

1:50:43.260 --> 1:50:44.860
 where there's really no distinction

1:50:44.860 --> 1:50:46.940
 between psychology and neuroscience.

1:50:46.940 --> 1:50:50.900
 Neuroscience is about studying the mechanisms

1:50:50.900 --> 1:50:54.660
 that underlie whatever it is the brain is for,

1:50:54.660 --> 1:50:56.340
 and what is the brain for?

1:50:56.340 --> 1:50:58.460
 What is the brain for? It's for behavior.

1:50:58.460 --> 1:51:03.100
 I feel like we could maybe take a step toward that now

1:51:03.100 --> 1:51:05.180
 if people are motivated in the right way.

1:51:06.780 --> 1:51:08.780
 You also asked about AI.

1:51:08.780 --> 1:51:10.340
 So that was a neuroscience question.

1:51:10.340 --> 1:51:12.180
 You said neuroscience, that's right.

1:51:12.180 --> 1:51:13.740
 And especially places like DeepMind

1:51:13.740 --> 1:51:15.260
 are interested in both branches.

1:51:15.260 --> 1:51:18.720
 So what about the engineering of intelligence systems?

1:51:20.820 --> 1:51:24.900
 I think one of the key challenges

1:51:24.900 --> 1:51:28.700
 that a lot of people are seeing now in AI

1:51:28.700 --> 1:51:33.700
 is to build systems that have the kind of flexibility

1:51:34.300 --> 1:51:38.580
 and the kind of flexibility that humans have in two senses.

1:51:38.580 --> 1:51:41.860
 One is that humans can be good at many things.

1:51:41.860 --> 1:51:44.300
 They're not just expert at one thing.

1:51:44.300 --> 1:51:45.620
 And they're also flexible in the sense

1:51:45.620 --> 1:51:49.660
 that they can switch between things very easily

1:51:49.660 --> 1:51:52.060
 and they can pick up new things very quickly

1:51:52.060 --> 1:51:57.060
 because they very ably see what a new task has in common

1:51:57.620 --> 1:51:59.420
 with other things that they've done.

1:52:01.860 --> 1:52:05.340
 And that's something that our AI systems

1:52:05.340 --> 1:52:08.060
 just blatantly do not have.

1:52:09.100 --> 1:52:11.380
 There are some people who like to argue

1:52:11.380 --> 1:52:13.740
 that deep learning and deep RL

1:52:13.740 --> 1:52:17.080
 are simply wrong for getting that kind of flexibility.

1:52:17.080 --> 1:52:20.060
 I don't share that belief,

1:52:20.060 --> 1:52:22.620
 but the simpler fact of the matter

1:52:22.620 --> 1:52:23.860
 is we're not building things yet

1:52:23.860 --> 1:52:25.500
 that do have that kind of flexibility.

1:52:25.500 --> 1:52:28.700
 And I think the attention of a large part

1:52:28.700 --> 1:52:31.500
 of the AI community is starting to pivot to that question.

1:52:31.500 --> 1:52:32.460
 How do we get that?

1:52:33.460 --> 1:52:38.060
 That's gonna lead to a focus on abstraction.

1:52:38.060 --> 1:52:40.460
 It's gonna lead to a focus on

1:52:40.460 --> 1:52:43.620
 what in psychology we call cognitive control,

1:52:43.620 --> 1:52:45.900
 which is the ability to switch between tasks,

1:52:45.900 --> 1:52:49.300
 the ability to quickly put together a program of behavior

1:52:49.300 --> 1:52:51.740
 that you've never executed before,

1:52:51.740 --> 1:52:55.260
 but you know makes sense for a particular set of demands.

1:52:55.260 --> 1:52:58.140
 It's very closely related to what the prefrontal cortex does

1:52:59.140 --> 1:53:01.060
 on the neuroscience side.

1:53:01.060 --> 1:53:05.380
 So I think it's gonna be an interesting new chapter.

1:53:05.380 --> 1:53:07.420
 So that's the reasoning side and cognition side,

1:53:07.420 --> 1:53:10.540
 but let me ask the over romanticized question.

1:53:10.540 --> 1:53:13.700
 Do you think we'll ever engineer an AGI system

1:53:13.700 --> 1:53:17.140
 that we humans would be able to love

1:53:17.140 --> 1:53:19.580
 and that would love us back?

1:53:19.580 --> 1:53:23.060
 So have that level and depth of connection?

1:53:26.220 --> 1:53:27.860
 I love that question.

1:53:27.860 --> 1:53:31.980
 And it relates closely to things

1:53:31.980 --> 1:53:33.900
 that I've been thinking about a lot lately,

1:53:33.900 --> 1:53:36.620
 in the context of this human AI research.

1:53:36.620 --> 1:53:39.940
 There's social psychology research

1:53:41.140 --> 1:53:44.940
 in particular by Susan Fisk at Princeton

1:53:44.940 --> 1:53:47.100
 the department where I used to work,

1:53:48.420 --> 1:53:53.420
 where she dissects human attitudes toward other humans

1:53:54.500 --> 1:53:59.500
 into a sort of two dimensional scheme.

1:53:59.900 --> 1:54:03.940
 And one dimension is about ability.

1:54:03.940 --> 1:54:08.220
 How able, how capable is this other person?

1:54:10.100 --> 1:54:11.780
 But the other dimension is warmth.

1:54:11.780 --> 1:54:15.580
 So you can imagine another person who's very skilled

1:54:15.580 --> 1:54:17.740
 and capable, but is very cold.

1:54:19.540 --> 1:54:22.500
 And you wouldn't really like highly,

1:54:22.500 --> 1:54:25.140
 you might have some reservations about that other person.

1:54:26.660 --> 1:54:28.980
 But there's also a kind of reservation

1:54:28.980 --> 1:54:31.020
 that we might have about another person

1:54:31.020 --> 1:54:34.860
 who elicits in us or displays a lot of human warmth,

1:54:34.860 --> 1:54:37.940
 but is not good at getting things done.

1:54:37.940 --> 1:54:40.940
 We reserve our greatest esteem really

1:54:40.940 --> 1:54:43.820
 for people who are both highly capable

1:54:43.820 --> 1:54:47.300
 and also quite warm.

1:54:47.300 --> 1:54:49.820
 That's like the best of the best.

1:54:49.820 --> 1:54:53.300
 This isn't a normative statement I'm making.

1:54:53.300 --> 1:54:55.780
 This is just an empirical statement.

1:54:55.780 --> 1:54:57.180
 This is what humans seem...

1:54:57.180 --> 1:54:59.740
 These are the two dimensions that people seem to kind of like

1:54:59.740 --> 1:55:02.660
 along which people size other people up.

1:55:02.660 --> 1:55:03.980
 And in AI research,

1:55:03.980 --> 1:55:06.580
 there's a lot of people who think that humans are

1:55:06.580 --> 1:55:08.700
 very capable, and in AI research,

1:55:08.700 --> 1:55:11.420
 we really focus on this capability thing.

1:55:11.420 --> 1:55:13.420
 We want our agents to be able to do stuff.

1:55:13.420 --> 1:55:15.460
 This thing can play go at a superhuman level.

1:55:15.460 --> 1:55:16.860
 That's awesome.

1:55:16.860 --> 1:55:18.700
 But that's only one dimension.

1:55:18.700 --> 1:55:20.060
 What about the other dimension?

1:55:20.060 --> 1:55:25.060
 What would it mean for an AI system to be warm?

1:55:25.060 --> 1:55:27.620
 And I don't know, maybe there are easy solutions here.

1:55:27.620 --> 1:55:30.620
 Like we can put a face on our AI systems.

1:55:30.620 --> 1:55:32.020
 It's cute, it has big ears.

1:55:32.020 --> 1:55:33.820
 I mean, that's probably part of it.

1:55:33.820 --> 1:55:36.540
 But I think it also has to do with a pattern of behavior.

1:55:36.540 --> 1:55:40.180
 A pattern of what would it mean for an AI system

1:55:40.180 --> 1:55:43.460
 to display caring, compassionate behavior

1:55:43.460 --> 1:55:47.740
 in a way that actually made us feel like it was for real?

1:55:47.740 --> 1:55:49.940
 That we didn't feel like it was simulated.

1:55:49.940 --> 1:55:51.900
 We didn't feel like we were being duped.

1:55:53.100 --> 1:55:55.740
 To me, people talk about the Turing test

1:55:55.740 --> 1:55:57.860
 or some descendant of it.

1:55:57.860 --> 1:56:01.140
 I feel like that's the ultimate Turing test.

1:56:01.140 --> 1:56:05.460
 Is there an AI system that can not only convince us

1:56:05.460 --> 1:56:07.180
 that it knows how to reason

1:56:07.180 --> 1:56:09.100
 and it knows how to interpret language,

1:56:09.100 --> 1:56:12.700
 but that we're comfortable saying,

1:56:12.700 --> 1:56:14.580
 yeah, that AI system's a good guy.

1:56:15.980 --> 1:56:18.700
 On the warmth scale, whatever warmth is,

1:56:18.700 --> 1:56:20.860
 we kind of intuitively understand it,

1:56:20.860 --> 1:56:25.060
 but we also wanna be able to, yeah,

1:56:25.060 --> 1:56:29.180
 we don't understand it explicitly enough yet

1:56:29.180 --> 1:56:30.940
 to be able to engineer it.

1:56:30.940 --> 1:56:31.780
 Exactly.

1:56:31.780 --> 1:56:33.620
 And that's an open scientific question.

1:56:33.620 --> 1:56:35.340
 You kind of alluded it several times

1:56:35.340 --> 1:56:37.220
 in the human AI interaction.

1:56:37.220 --> 1:56:38.900
 That's a question that should be studied

1:56:38.900 --> 1:56:42.300
 and probably one of the most important questions

1:56:42.300 --> 1:56:43.540
 as we move to AGI.

1:56:43.540 --> 1:56:46.020
 We humans are so good at it.

1:56:46.020 --> 1:56:46.860
 Yeah.

1:56:46.860 --> 1:56:50.140
 It's not just that we're born warm.

1:56:50.140 --> 1:56:53.060
 I suppose some people are warmer than others

1:56:53.060 --> 1:56:55.700
 given whatever genes they manage to inherit.

1:56:55.700 --> 1:57:00.700
 But there are also learned skills involved.

1:57:01.620 --> 1:57:04.740
 There are ways of communicating to other people

1:57:04.740 --> 1:57:07.740
 that you care, that they matter to you,

1:57:07.740 --> 1:57:11.100
 that you're enjoying interacting with them, right?

1:57:11.100 --> 1:57:14.140
 And we learn these skills from one another.

1:57:14.140 --> 1:57:16.740
 And it's not out of the question

1:57:16.740 --> 1:57:20.020
 that we could build engineered systems.

1:57:20.020 --> 1:57:21.460
 I think it's hopeless, as you say,

1:57:21.460 --> 1:57:23.580
 that we could somehow hand design

1:57:23.580 --> 1:57:26.100
 these sorts of behaviors.

1:57:26.100 --> 1:57:27.060
 But it's not out of the question

1:57:27.060 --> 1:57:30.060
 that we could build systems that kind of,

1:57:30.060 --> 1:57:34.460
 we instill in them something that sets them out

1:57:34.460 --> 1:57:35.980
 in the right direction,

1:57:35.980 --> 1:57:39.580
 so that they end up learning what it is

1:57:39.580 --> 1:57:40.540
 to interact with humans

1:57:40.540 --> 1:57:44.180
 in a way that's gratifying to humans.

1:57:44.180 --> 1:57:47.500
 I mean, honestly, if that's not where we're headed,

1:57:49.220 --> 1:57:50.340
 I want out.

1:57:50.340 --> 1:57:54.940
 I think it's exciting as a scientific problem,

1:57:54.940 --> 1:57:56.820
 just as you described.

1:57:56.820 --> 1:57:59.500
 I honestly don't see a better way to end it

1:57:59.500 --> 1:58:01.180
 than talking about warmth and love.

1:58:01.180 --> 1:58:05.380
 And Matt, I don't think I've ever had such a wonderful

1:58:05.380 --> 1:58:07.540
 conversation where my questions were so bad

1:58:07.540 --> 1:58:09.380
 and your answers were so beautiful.

1:58:09.380 --> 1:58:10.740
 So I deeply appreciate it.

1:58:10.740 --> 1:58:11.580
 I really enjoyed it.

1:58:11.580 --> 1:58:12.420
 Thanks for talking to me.

1:58:12.420 --> 1:58:13.260
 Well, it's been very fun.

1:58:13.260 --> 1:58:14.580
 As you can probably tell,

1:58:17.140 --> 1:58:19.020
 there's something I like about kind of thinking

1:58:19.020 --> 1:58:21.060
 outside the box and like,

1:58:21.060 --> 1:58:22.940
 so it's good having an opportunity to do that.

1:58:22.940 --> 1:58:23.780
 Awesome.

1:58:23.780 --> 1:58:25.620
 Thanks so much for doing it.

1:58:25.620 --> 1:58:27.180
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

1:58:27.180 --> 1:58:28.420
 with Matt Bopenik.

1:59:15.060 --> 1:59:17.100
 And now let me leave you with some words

1:59:17.100 --> 1:59:20.820
 from neurologist V.S. Amarachandran.

1:59:20.820 --> 1:59:23.340
 How can a three pound mass of jelly

1:59:23.340 --> 1:59:26.620
 that you can hold in your palm imagine angels,

1:59:26.620 --> 1:59:28.700
 contemplate the meaning of an infinity

1:59:28.700 --> 1:59:31.740
 and even question its own place in the cosmos?

1:59:31.740 --> 1:59:35.660
 Especially awe inspiring is the fact that any single brain,

1:59:35.660 --> 1:59:38.580
 including yours, is made up of atoms

1:59:38.580 --> 1:59:40.060
 that were forged in the hearts

1:59:40.060 --> 1:59:45.060
 of countless far flung stars billions of years ago.

1:59:45.500 --> 1:59:48.340
 These particles drifted for eons and light years

1:59:48.340 --> 1:59:53.180
 until gravity and change brought them together here now.

1:59:53.180 --> 1:59:57.540
 These atoms now form a conglomerate, your brain,

1:59:57.540 --> 2:00:00.860
 that can not only ponder the very stars they gave at birth,

2:00:00.860 --> 2:00:04.180
 but can also think about its own ability to think

2:00:04.180 --> 2:00:07.820
 and wonder about its own ability to wander.

2:00:07.820 --> 2:00:10.660
 With the arrival of humans, it has been said,

2:00:10.660 --> 2:00:14.580
 the universe has suddenly become conscious of itself.

2:00:14.580 --> 2:00:18.620
 This truly is the greatest mystery of all.

2:00:18.620 --> 2:00:31.620
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
