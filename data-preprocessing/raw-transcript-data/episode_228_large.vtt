 The following is a conversation with RZA.

00:03.340 --> 00:06.740
 The rapper, record producer, filmmaker, actor, writer,

00:06.740 --> 00:10.700
 philosopher, Kung Fu scholar, and the mastermind

00:10.700 --> 00:14.880
 of the legendary hip hop group Wu Tang Clan.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.260
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:19.260 --> 00:20.460
 in the description.

00:20.460 --> 00:23.620
 And now, here's my conversation with RZA.

00:24.860 --> 00:27.140
 In the Tao of Wu, you write,

00:27.140 --> 00:30.100
 when my mother left the physical world, I lost one

00:30.100 --> 00:32.460
 of my main links to the universe.

00:32.460 --> 00:35.180
 They say that you have an umbilical cord

00:35.180 --> 00:38.140
 and an etheric cord, which is the invisible cord

00:38.140 --> 00:41.300
 that attaches you to your soul, your mother's soul

00:41.300 --> 00:43.180
 and all other souls.

00:43.180 --> 00:46.420
 When one passes away, you really lose something.

00:46.420 --> 00:48.260
 It's physical and mental.

00:48.260 --> 00:49.460
 It's real.

00:49.460 --> 00:50.620
 Part of you dies.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.860
 What have you learned about life from your mother?

00:54.860 --> 00:58.860
 I mean, I learned life itself from my mother.

01:00.180 --> 01:03.700
 You know, being one of 11 children

01:05.040 --> 01:10.040
 and seeing the sacrifice that she gave to us,

01:10.340 --> 01:12.160
 therefore given to life.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.520
 It's really the greatest lesson of life.

01:16.760 --> 01:21.340
 The thing that shook me as I wrote those words

01:21.340 --> 01:26.340
 was coming up young with arrogance, confidence,

01:31.620 --> 01:33.240
 knowledge of myself.

01:34.220 --> 01:35.980
 They called me the scientist.

01:36.980 --> 01:40.300
 We was taught you're the supreme being.

01:40.300 --> 01:41.700
 In order to be the supreme being,

01:41.700 --> 01:44.720
 you gotta be supreme amongst other beings.

01:47.140 --> 01:50.100
 I understand that more now than I did then

01:50.100 --> 01:52.040
 because then it was so literal.

01:53.100 --> 01:57.260
 You know, the word God derived basically

01:57.260 --> 01:58.860
 from the Greek language, as they say,

01:58.860 --> 02:01.940
 and it meant wisdom, strength and beauty.

02:03.660 --> 02:06.140
 Yeah, we could have that.

02:06.140 --> 02:08.740
 But the power to control life and death

02:09.740 --> 02:14.240
 is something that you would assume is a God trait.

02:14.240 --> 02:19.240
 So now here you are saying that you're a God, right?

02:20.120 --> 02:21.380
 And you're reading the Bible,

02:21.380 --> 02:23.600
 how Jesus brought back Lazarus.

02:24.440 --> 02:27.400
 And you know, now it's your turn to do something.

02:28.320 --> 02:31.480
 And when my mother was laying there in the hospital bed

02:32.320 --> 02:34.800
 and air was no longer coming out of her lungs

02:34.800 --> 02:36.240
 and going into her lungs,

02:37.640 --> 02:39.900
 where's my power to bring her back to life?

02:39.900 --> 02:44.700
 Yeah, so you can't truly be God.

02:44.700 --> 02:46.340
 You're powerless.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.940
 Yeah, or God is not the definition

02:48.940 --> 02:50.700
 that we need to use to describe it

02:51.580 --> 02:54.660
 because it's a translation of wisdom, strength and beauty.

02:54.660 --> 02:56.340
 So you could be that.

02:56.340 --> 02:58.520
 But so I'm answering your question,

02:58.520 --> 03:00.020
 what did my mother teach me about life?

03:00.020 --> 03:02.860
 I learned that day on her physical passing,

03:03.740 --> 03:07.800
 that okay, you know what I mean, there's a physical me.

03:07.800 --> 03:12.100
 Do you think about her, do you miss her?

03:12.100 --> 03:16.560
 Of course, I keep my mother in my prayer every day.

03:17.800 --> 03:22.800
 And the thing I pray the most beyond giving thanks

03:23.460 --> 03:27.420
 is I pray that her name is honored

03:27.420 --> 03:29.240
 and remembered by my family.

03:30.300 --> 03:33.660
 I don't know if the world's gonna remember that, right?

03:33.660 --> 03:36.000
 Even though if you watch my movie, Love Beats Rhymes,

03:36.000 --> 03:39.060
 I named the school in that movie after my mother

03:39.060 --> 03:41.700
 just to leave it somewhere else.

03:41.700 --> 03:43.940
 Yeah, in physical space.

03:43.940 --> 03:45.140
 Yeah, exactly.

03:45.140 --> 03:47.720
 But yeah, painful.

03:47.720 --> 03:51.880
 The pain of my mother's passing is indescribable.

03:51.880 --> 03:55.380
 Only until it happens to a person they know

03:55.380 --> 03:56.880
 and then they won't describe it either.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.540
 Only the people that lost their mother,

03:58.540 --> 04:00.820
 they could look at each other and they got this nod.

04:00.820 --> 04:01.820
 You know what I mean?

04:01.820 --> 04:06.820
 But one other thing happened to me was the joy of life

04:07.580 --> 04:08.620
 hit me differently.

04:10.860 --> 04:15.860
 And I think it was the realization of my own mortality

04:17.860 --> 04:19.760
 versus my immortality.

04:21.340 --> 04:22.620
 It's a big, big thing.

04:22.620 --> 04:25.060
 And I don't know if we'll get to expound on that,

04:25.060 --> 04:26.740
 but there was a joy that overcame me

04:26.740 --> 04:30.420
 because I was kind of free of a certain illusion

04:30.420 --> 04:34.340
 about the immortality of my physical being

04:35.380 --> 04:39.100
 versus the mortality of my physical being.

04:39.100 --> 04:42.180
 And I was like, okay, wow, I understand.

04:42.180 --> 04:45.860
 So that was the first or the hardest realization

04:45.860 --> 04:47.820
 you've experienced that you're mortal.

04:48.740 --> 04:49.660
 Yeah, that, yeah.

04:49.660 --> 04:53.580
 And I'll say mortal and what you're looking at here

04:53.580 --> 04:58.180
 physically, I won't say my soul is mortal.

04:58.180 --> 05:01.200
 I'll say it's immortal because at the end of the day,

05:02.220 --> 05:05.840
 it's just like I can sit here and I could just hum,

05:05.840 --> 05:10.180
 please, please, please, by James Brown.

05:10.180 --> 05:14.500
 But James Brown is not gonna come in here and do that.

05:16.460 --> 05:18.380
 So in some sense, James Brown is still here.

05:18.380 --> 05:19.220
 In another sense, he's gone.

05:19.220 --> 05:20.420
 His soul is here.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.420
 His soul is here.

05:22.420 --> 05:25.580
 Well, it lives through you by you singing it.

05:25.580 --> 05:28.820
 It lives through you by you listening to it, celebrating it.

05:28.820 --> 05:32.500
 And the hope is that the human species continues

05:32.500 --> 05:34.900
 to celebrate the great minds

05:34.900 --> 05:36.880
 and the great creations of the past.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.580
 I will add this to that equation.

05:41.460 --> 05:43.040
 When I say it's immortal,

05:44.280 --> 05:45.860
 I don't think it's not just only

05:45.860 --> 05:48.340
 because somebody sings it, right?

05:48.340 --> 05:50.980
 It's like, where's the fire at right now?

05:52.600 --> 05:54.100
 It's in the air.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.260
 You just gotta spark the spark.

05:56.260 --> 05:58.820
 Yeah.

05:58.820 --> 06:00.180
 So it's always there.

06:01.620 --> 06:03.300
 Are you afraid of death?

06:03.300 --> 06:05.660
 Nah, I'm not afraid of death.

06:05.660 --> 06:07.220
 I'm not trying to see it.

06:08.380 --> 06:10.840
 I'm not watching that nowhere near me, right?

06:10.840 --> 06:12.940
 Because all I know is life, right?

06:12.940 --> 06:14.120
 My life is living.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.460
 I read a lot of ancient texts,

06:17.460 --> 06:19.420
 people probably know about me.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.980
 I love one of the great teachers named Bodhidharma.

06:21.980 --> 06:26.980
 And there was a thing written in one of the books of his

06:29.700 --> 06:30.900
 or one of the teachings of his.

06:30.900 --> 06:34.900
 And the question, somebody asked him similar question,

06:34.900 --> 06:37.420
 you're scared of death or what are you gonna be

06:37.420 --> 06:39.500
 after you die?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.500
 And his answer was, I don't know.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.800
 He had answers to everything.

06:43.800 --> 06:44.640
 But he was like, I don't know.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.580
 They said, oh, he doesn't know that.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.340
 So yeah, because I haven't died yet.

06:48.340 --> 06:52.100
 Yeah, well, the uncertainty to some people is terrifying.

06:52.100 --> 06:55.060
 Not knowing what's on the other side of the door.

06:55.060 --> 06:56.180
 Yeah.

06:56.180 --> 06:58.140
 I mean, especially when you're young.

06:58.140 --> 07:03.140
 You know, as a kid, fear permeated my life.

07:03.560 --> 07:04.400
 You know what I mean?

07:04.400 --> 07:06.420
 You know, I was actually watching horror movies

07:06.420 --> 07:10.740
 and I believed in all type of supernatural things

07:10.740 --> 07:12.060
 that could or can happen.

07:12.060 --> 07:14.460
 I thought I saw things as well.

07:14.460 --> 07:17.340
 And you know, whether it was being projected

07:17.340 --> 07:19.500
 in my own mind or whether it was there visible to me,

07:19.500 --> 07:20.600
 I don't know, right?

07:22.340 --> 07:27.340
 But life is beautiful and we have it.

07:28.200 --> 07:31.980
 And we should use it all the way to the last drop.

07:32.860 --> 07:36.820
 Realizing the mortality, the gift your mother gave to you

07:36.820 --> 07:38.900
 is realizing the immortal.

07:38.900 --> 07:42.620
 And in so doing, help you realize that life is beautiful.

07:42.620 --> 07:43.820
 Yeah.

07:43.820 --> 07:48.580
 On this topic, Quincy Jones, I read, said to ODB and you,

07:48.580 --> 07:50.340
 when it rains, get wet.

07:51.300 --> 07:52.940
 What do these words mean to you?

07:54.820 --> 07:58.020
 Well, I think what Quincy was saying at that time was,

07:58.020 --> 08:02.100
 you know, I think I was more conservative,

08:02.100 --> 08:03.780
 like as a person.

08:03.780 --> 08:07.280
 And like, you know, I had money.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.060
 Women wanted me.

08:09.060 --> 08:13.740
 Anything I kind of wanted, I probably could have had.

08:13.740 --> 08:15.220
 You know what I mean?

08:15.220 --> 08:17.060
 And he was just saying, when it rains, get wet.

08:17.060 --> 08:18.220
 Enjoy this, man.

08:18.220 --> 08:19.360
 It's raining on you.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.340
 You know what I mean?

08:21.340 --> 08:22.540
 Don't put up the umbrella.

08:22.540 --> 08:24.900
 Don't go back in the house.

08:24.900 --> 08:25.780
 Get wet.

08:25.780 --> 08:27.080
 Experience the moment.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.420
 Yeah, and enjoy it.

08:28.420 --> 08:32.620
 And I didn't take total heed to him at that time.

08:32.620 --> 08:35.300
 A couple of years later, I took some heed.

08:35.300 --> 08:36.940
 But at that time, I didn't take heed.

08:36.940 --> 08:39.400
 And when I took heed,

08:39.400 --> 08:44.400
 I think that I may have misinterpreted

08:46.080 --> 08:48.200
 by looking at his example of getting wet

08:48.200 --> 08:50.120
 versus my example of getting wet.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.520
 And I can tell you right now,

08:52.520 --> 08:56.160
 I'm getting wet right now in my way.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.520
 In part, thanks to your mother.

08:57.520 --> 09:01.600
 But overall, you just learned how to appreciate the rain,

09:01.600 --> 09:04.740
 just like the experience of every moment.

09:04.740 --> 09:05.840
 Yeah, and I'll share this with you

09:05.840 --> 09:08.460
 because this is going to be a very open conversation

09:08.460 --> 09:09.960
 and I haven't had this conversation.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.760
 So definitely in part to my mother,

09:12.760 --> 09:14.060
 then in part to my wife.

09:15.360 --> 09:19.560
 I meet my wife, it's my second wife,

09:19.560 --> 09:22.360
 but I met her after my mother passed.

09:22.360 --> 09:23.920
 And she was just a friend.

09:23.920 --> 09:27.120
 You know, some girl I met, I thought she was beautiful

09:27.120 --> 09:29.320
 and actually built a friendship with her.

09:31.280 --> 09:35.360
 But a few years later, when the relationship became like,

09:35.360 --> 09:37.600
 you know, this is going to be my woman,

09:37.600 --> 09:42.040
 it was actually when I was doing the middle of my divorce

09:42.040 --> 09:45.680
 and I was like, you know, do I run wild and hey, hey, hey,

09:45.680 --> 09:48.880
 you know, me and my wife already filed, we were separated.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.240
 And do I run wild?

09:51.240 --> 09:54.160
 And I didn't run wild, a little bit, but not too wild.

09:55.520 --> 10:00.360
 And you know, I'm still a man, I'm a hip hop guy, so.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.640
 I read you know how to party.

10:01.640 --> 10:02.880
 Yeah, exactly.

10:02.880 --> 10:07.880
 But the funny thing is that my wife now, her name is Talani,

10:08.440 --> 10:13.440
 my uncle said, she reminds me of your mother.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.840
 He knew my mother before I knew my mother.

10:18.920 --> 10:23.920
 And he saw that and we ended up dating, got engaged

10:26.960 --> 10:28.540
 and then her mother passes.

10:28.540 --> 10:33.540
 And so now there's a total understanding of everything.

10:35.680 --> 10:38.600
 And we actually help build each other back up.

10:38.600 --> 10:42.340
 So of course I have to thank my mother for the awareness.

10:43.360 --> 10:47.820
 Then I thank my wife for bringing that awareness

10:47.820 --> 10:52.820
 to actual actualization, like to actually feel,

10:52.880 --> 10:54.560
 I don't think I'll be talking to you right now

10:54.560 --> 10:56.760
 and talking as much as I do these days,

10:56.760 --> 11:00.000
 if it wasn't for the security and peace and harmony

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
 that I was able to gain at home, you know, so.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.920
 And like you said, you now share that look

11:07.920 --> 11:12.540
 of having both lost your, your mom.

11:13.980 --> 11:16.320
 What have you learned from Quincy about music,

11:16.320 --> 11:17.940
 about business, about life?

11:19.640 --> 11:24.520
 Quincy Jones is a great mind, great artist, you know,

11:24.520 --> 11:27.040
 a treasure in all reality.

11:27.040 --> 11:30.720
 He seen it from when it was, he couldn't walk in this,

11:30.720 --> 11:34.000
 he couldn't eat in the same places he played his music at

11:34.000 --> 11:36.840
 to owning places bigger than ours.

11:36.840 --> 11:38.640
 So what a beautiful life, you know?

11:41.760 --> 11:44.460
 He's the type of guy, if you spend one hour with him,

11:45.640 --> 11:48.840
 you got a lifetime of information.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.960
 And I was blessed to spend multiple hours with him

11:50.960 --> 11:51.800
 and days with him.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.000
 And, you know, there's a certain period of time

11:54.000 --> 11:57.320
 where we came across each other and he was always

11:58.320 --> 11:59.560
 there to share the knowledge.

11:59.560 --> 12:01.840
 Like that's another thing about him that I think is special.

12:01.840 --> 12:04.960
 And hopefully I picked that up,

12:04.960 --> 12:09.240
 is that he's always willing to share,

12:09.240 --> 12:12.120
 share with his experience, his knowledge.

12:12.120 --> 12:17.120
 I mean, I think he'll even share his home

12:17.460 --> 12:19.920
 to the right person if he feels that that's what they need

12:19.920 --> 12:20.960
 to get back on their feet.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.280
 He's a very beautiful man.

12:22.280 --> 12:26.000
 So just the kindness, the goodness of the man

12:26.000 --> 12:28.820
 is like the thing that really rubbed off on you.

12:28.820 --> 12:31.200
 Yeah, I mean, minimum, right?

12:31.200 --> 12:34.800
 I mean, Quincy Jones also in his fifties,

12:34.800 --> 12:38.600
 as a producer, produced one of the greatest albums

12:38.600 --> 12:41.420
 of all time and one of the greatest selling albums

12:41.420 --> 12:42.260
 of all time.

12:42.260 --> 12:45.740
 Not just great critically, economically great.

12:45.740 --> 12:49.720
 And I mean, I think he did it at the age I am right now.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.520
 So I might have a great year coming up.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.360
 I don't know.

12:52.360 --> 12:53.200
 Yeah.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.360
 Time and well, yeah.

12:57.320 --> 13:00.160
 So now you got a taste of what greatness is.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.680
 You get to see what greatness is.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.680
 So you know what you need to do for yourself.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.660
 Exactly, how to strive for yourself, yeah.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.600
 You have a few people you've worked with

13:08.600 --> 13:10.640
 who are fascinating like yourself.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.920
 Quentin Tarantino, you worked with him.

13:14.040 --> 13:16.360
 When somebody asked you to describe him with one word,

13:16.360 --> 13:18.480
 you said encyclopedia.

13:18.480 --> 13:19.960
 What have you learned from the guy

13:19.960 --> 13:22.720
 about filmmaking and about life again?

13:22.720 --> 13:25.040
 A very generous man with his knowledge.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.840
 And for me, he shared it, I think,

13:27.840 --> 13:30.740
 in a way that was unique in a sense of,

13:31.720 --> 13:34.000
 you know, at a point in time,

13:34.000 --> 13:35.820
 you know, we just was super duper tight.

13:35.820 --> 13:38.200
 Like, you know, like I'm going to this crib

13:38.200 --> 13:42.260
 and watching movies and just having long conversations

13:42.260 --> 13:44.460
 about art and about life.

13:44.460 --> 13:45.460
 You know what I mean?

13:46.720 --> 13:48.000
 So I learned a lot.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.920
 I consider him, you know,

13:49.920 --> 13:53.560
 especially when it comes to anything cinematic in my life,

13:53.560 --> 13:56.320
 I consider him the godfather of that for me.

13:56.320 --> 14:01.320
 I think, you know, I humbly asked him to mentor me,

14:02.180 --> 14:04.560
 which is a very humbling thing to do

14:04.560 --> 14:07.240
 coming from my neighborhood, coming from who I am,

14:07.240 --> 14:11.240
 coming from, I was already a multi platinum artist,

14:11.240 --> 14:13.900
 you know, I mean, it was a year,

14:13.900 --> 14:16.120
 it was past the year 2000 already.

14:16.120 --> 14:20.200
 So like 2001, 2002 that I asked him to mentor me.

14:20.200 --> 14:23.560
 So I was the wizard already, you know what I mean?

14:23.560 --> 14:28.440
 But I humbled myself because I saw in him

14:28.440 --> 14:33.440
 a craft of brain power that to me resonated with me,

14:34.200 --> 14:37.840
 but I was just a Patamon at it, I was a novice at it

14:38.800 --> 14:42.200
 because I was trying to make movies in my music,

14:42.200 --> 14:44.240
 you know, trying to make videos.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.320
 And here was a man who was a master of it

14:46.320 --> 14:48.740
 and an encyclopedia of it as well.

14:50.360 --> 14:51.520
 Like film history.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.240
 Film history from whether it's the actor,

14:54.240 --> 14:56.680
 the director, the cinematographer,

14:56.680 --> 14:58.480
 maybe even the costume designer.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.280
 He may know 50, 60,

15:00.280 --> 15:02.560
 he may know the 50 greatest costume designers

15:02.560 --> 15:04.240
 in his memory.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.360
 Yeah, I mean, it's a guy's brain.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.160
 Both of you have pretty good memory.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.680
 Yeah.

15:09.680 --> 15:12.720
 I'd love to be a fly on the wall of that conversation.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.560
 And kung fu movies, most of you guys want.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.240
 We actually started,

15:16.240 --> 15:19.720
 I think we started our relationship

15:19.720 --> 15:21.520
 trying to outdo each other.

15:21.520 --> 15:22.840
 Knowledge wise or what?

15:22.840 --> 15:24.840
 Yeah, movie knowledge wise.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.280
 Actually kung fu movie knowledge wise.

15:27.280 --> 15:29.760
 And I think that, if it wasn't another category,

15:29.760 --> 15:30.800
 I wouldn't have had a chance,

15:30.800 --> 15:33.240
 but at least in that category,

15:33.240 --> 15:35.160
 I was pretty holding my weight.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.200
 For one.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.440
 You know what?

15:37.440 --> 15:42.080
 I'll be honest and say that I may have said a few,

15:42.080 --> 15:44.920
 he didn't see, but Quentin is older than me.

15:44.920 --> 15:45.760
 Yeah.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.320
 So he could go back.

15:47.320 --> 15:48.160
 Farther.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.240
 Yeah, he could go back to 72

15:50.240 --> 15:51.320
 when I didn't see one yet.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.160
 You know what I mean?

15:52.160 --> 15:53.000
 Yeah.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.080
 Well, he said Master of the Flying Gate Team

15:55.080 --> 15:56.800
 that I got a chance to,

15:56.800 --> 15:58.160
 that you commentated over today

15:58.160 --> 16:00.160
 and I got a chance to see the screening of.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.640
 He said that's one of his favorites.

16:03.760 --> 16:08.000
 For you, the 36 Chamber of Shaolin,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.080
 the Master Killer is your favorite.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.920
 Best ever, would you say?

16:11.920 --> 16:15.680
 That's the greatest Kung Fu movie ever?

16:15.680 --> 16:18.080
 It's hard to say the greatest ever, right?

16:18.080 --> 16:20.160
 Because somebody may make another one

16:20.160 --> 16:22.600
 and it depends on your own phase of life.

16:22.600 --> 16:27.600
 But I will put that first.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.200
 If I want to introduce somebody to Kung Fu movies,

16:30.200 --> 16:32.360
 that's a beautiful entry.

16:32.360 --> 16:35.000
 You talk about knowledge, you talk about wisdom.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.600
 What kind of wisdom do you draw from Kung Fu movies?

16:38.600 --> 16:39.840
 The, you know what?

16:39.840 --> 16:42.520
 The martial art itself and the movies.

16:42.520 --> 16:46.320
 It's endless wisdom to be drawn and I draw it, you know?

16:47.600 --> 16:49.560
 I draw it in a way, you know,

16:49.560 --> 16:52.480
 that I could decipher it in my own life.

16:53.480 --> 16:58.480
 So for instance, in the movie, Master Killer,

17:00.680 --> 17:04.040
 he basically, when he does Kung Fu,

17:04.040 --> 17:08.000
 he does it really a style called the Hung Ga technique.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.240
 And the director of the movie

17:10.240 --> 17:14.840
 is actually a Hung Ga expert who has a lineage

17:14.840 --> 17:17.120
 that traces all the way back to Shaolin Temple.

17:17.120 --> 17:21.480
 And this director always wanted to keep his movies pure

17:21.480 --> 17:23.360
 and to bring Hung Ga to the world.

17:23.360 --> 17:26.480
 It's like he wanted to show the world this lineage.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.560
 In fact, you just said Master of the Flying Guillotine

17:29.560 --> 17:30.840
 is Quentin's favorite movie.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.120
 And we mentioned that 36 Chambers is my favorite movie,

17:33.120 --> 17:36.840
 but the action director of Master of Flying Guillotine

17:36.840 --> 17:40.720
 is the director of 36 Chambers of Shaolin.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.040
 And some of the things that's happening

17:43.040 --> 17:45.760
 in Master of the Flying Guillotine

17:45.760 --> 17:47.560
 is really the infant stage

17:47.560 --> 17:50.560
 of what this action director is going to learn

17:50.560 --> 17:53.440
 and then use later on in his movies.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.480
 So that's the beauty of it.

17:54.480 --> 17:57.240
 It's almost like, you know,

17:57.240 --> 17:59.840
 Quentin is seeing him in his generation.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.320
 So Quentin might have been the same age I was

18:02.320 --> 18:03.160
 watching that movie.

18:03.160 --> 18:05.080
 And then when he becomes a director,

18:05.080 --> 18:08.000
 I'm at Quentin's age and now I'm seeing his work.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.640
 So some symbionic relationship there.

18:10.640 --> 18:13.000
 And I'll end this question by saying,

18:14.480 --> 18:18.200
 Hung Ga deals with the five animal technique,

18:18.200 --> 18:23.200
 the tiger, the crane, the leopard, the snake, and a dragon.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.400
 Those are the five, that's the five pattern.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.840
 Some people go seven, some go 12,

18:27.840 --> 18:30.720
 but it's a stick to the five pattern fist.

18:30.720 --> 18:35.400
 How do a man emulate a tiger?

18:37.000 --> 18:39.040
 And you see a tiger's fists.

18:40.400 --> 18:43.600
 He curls before he spawns on you.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.520
 How does a man emulate a snake?

18:47.720 --> 18:50.960
 It doesn't have to be only in the Kung Fu move.

18:50.960 --> 18:54.760
 It's in the ideology of the snake.

18:54.760 --> 18:58.480
 It's in the agility of the crane.

18:58.480 --> 19:02.480
 At any moment, sometimes punching a person

19:02.480 --> 19:04.480
 is not going to work,

19:04.480 --> 19:07.240
 as they would say in leopard fist or tiger paw.

19:07.240 --> 19:10.840
 So sometimes you might have to poke them in the eye

19:10.840 --> 19:12.800
 with the crane's beak.

19:12.800 --> 19:16.360
 So having your mind able to adapt the instinct

19:17.280 --> 19:20.720
 of the animal when you are being attacked

19:20.720 --> 19:22.640
 or when you are being the aggressor,

19:24.120 --> 19:26.600
 that's something that you don't need a form for.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.520
 That's the mentality.

19:27.520 --> 19:30.800
 So Kung Fu, like I said, it informs me endlessly

19:30.800 --> 19:34.520
 because at first I was trying to learn how to hold my,

19:34.520 --> 19:35.960
 like, I can't really hit you with that

19:35.960 --> 19:37.840
 and really hurt you unless I've been banging my hand

19:37.840 --> 19:39.760
 a thousand times on some bricks

19:39.760 --> 19:43.400
 and made it so callous or muscles are so strong.

19:43.400 --> 19:47.720
 But the idea that if me and you was to get into a fight

19:47.720 --> 19:50.880
 and I'm going to tiger up on you and take that instinct

19:50.880 --> 19:53.280
 and prance when I'm a prance,

19:53.280 --> 19:58.240
 or fly away like the stork, you know what I mean?

19:58.240 --> 20:00.600
 Like, yo, that's the mentality.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.800
 It's much more than the technical moves.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.800
 It's much deeper.

20:04.800 --> 20:05.640
 Yeah.

20:06.640 --> 20:07.480
 Yeah, it's interesting.

20:07.480 --> 20:08.880
 I mean, when I see the Kung Fu movies,

20:08.880 --> 20:11.880
 because I love martial arts, all martial arts,

20:11.880 --> 20:13.000
 and competitive ones too,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.120
 like the actual competitions and so on.

20:15.120 --> 20:18.400
 It just seems like Kung Fu movies go much deeper

20:18.400 --> 20:20.160
 than just like the techniques.

20:20.160 --> 20:23.240
 Yeah, they start, I mean, if you see it, right,

20:23.240 --> 20:25.760
 even I watched the great MMA fight recently,

20:27.080 --> 20:30.120
 just interesting because he was on top of the guy,

20:32.560 --> 20:34.320
 and the way he got from under him,

20:38.360 --> 20:42.200
 it had to be his spirit got from under him.

20:42.200 --> 20:45.160
 It's some like mixture of crane and whatever.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.920
 Snake, ill, with the slippery ill technique.

20:48.920 --> 20:49.760
 Yeah.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.920
 No, I love that when people become artists in the cage

20:52.920 --> 20:56.040
 or that's much bigger than just like winning,

20:56.040 --> 20:57.800
 much bigger than particular techniques.

20:57.800 --> 21:00.640
 It's just art, especially at the highest level competition

21:00.640 --> 21:02.720
 where millions of people are watching.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.040
 Which is pressure within itself.

21:04.040 --> 21:07.320
 Yeah, that's art under pressure

21:07.320 --> 21:10.160
 is even more beautiful art.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.760
 You know, you look at some of these fights

21:11.760 --> 21:14.720
 and you wonder like why somebody wins and lose.

21:16.240 --> 21:19.280
 And sometimes the less talent guy could win

21:19.280 --> 21:21.600
 because he could deal with the pressure.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.200
 But the other guy, he could have beat them

21:23.200 --> 21:25.680
 if they were somewhere else, but not in this arena.

21:28.280 --> 21:31.880
 So you're a scholar of history, including hip hop history.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.400
 I've listened to so many of your interviews.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.480
 You've spoken brilliantly about some of the big figures

21:38.480 --> 21:43.240
 in hip hop history, Tupac, Biggie, Nas, many others.

21:44.360 --> 21:47.200
 Maybe let's look at Tupac and Biggie.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.880
 What made them special in the history of music?

21:49.880 --> 21:52.000
 Mm, that's a good question.

21:52.880 --> 21:56.200
 So I don't know if I'm the authority to answer it,

21:56.200 --> 21:58.840
 but I'll just speak my piece on it.

21:58.840 --> 22:00.720
 And maybe I could just add on.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.040
 Cause I'm sure it's a lot of people

22:02.040 --> 22:05.320
 that spent a lot of time with them that could speak on it.

22:05.320 --> 22:07.160
 But just as a fellow artist,

22:09.560 --> 22:14.480
 I think not only was B.I.G a dope lyricist,

22:14.480 --> 22:19.480
 I think he had a voice that was really immaculate.

22:19.480 --> 22:24.480
 In a sense that some rappers get on top of music

22:25.840 --> 22:27.200
 and you gotta get used to them

22:27.200 --> 22:30.400
 when you gotta vibe with them.

22:30.400 --> 22:35.400
 But he make a record sounds like a record immediately.

22:37.880 --> 22:40.760
 If you go back and listen to his music,

22:40.760 --> 22:43.120
 you could take his voice and put it on anything.

22:43.120 --> 22:47.280
 And for some reason, it sounds like a record.

22:47.280 --> 22:48.120
 You know what I mean?

22:48.120 --> 22:50.360
 You mean just like the raw voice of the man?

22:50.360 --> 22:51.200
 Yeah.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.760
 So you could just listen to it raw

22:52.760 --> 22:54.200
 and it sounds like a record.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.360
 Yeah, but if you put a beat,

22:56.360 --> 22:58.240
 take his voice and put it on any beat,

22:59.400 --> 23:04.160
 he just has a voice, it's immaculate, you know?

23:04.160 --> 23:06.440
 So his lyrical skills and all that was great.

23:07.760 --> 23:11.320
 And you gotta think once again, he's doing all this,

23:11.320 --> 23:12.880
 he's not even 25 years old.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.080
 Yeah, yeah.

23:14.080 --> 23:18.840
 And then you go to Pac, once again, immaculate voice.

23:18.840 --> 23:22.520
 But what Pac had, I think,

23:22.520 --> 23:27.520
 was a way of touching us on all of our emotions.

23:27.840 --> 23:30.960
 And especially on, like Pac had the power

23:30.960 --> 23:33.800
 to infuse your emotional thought.

23:33.800 --> 23:36.200
 Like Brenda has a baby, their mama.

23:37.280 --> 23:41.600
 But then he had the power to arouse the rebel in you.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.840
 You know?

23:43.840 --> 23:44.680
 Yeah.

23:44.680 --> 23:49.680
 And those two things, actually,

23:49.680 --> 23:54.680
 he was probably more dangerous than Big, Notorious B.I.G.

23:56.480 --> 23:59.360
 Like Notorious B.I.G., we could party with him.

23:59.360 --> 24:01.360
 To this day, we are still,

24:01.360 --> 24:04.440
 but Pac was probably going to a point,

24:04.440 --> 24:07.800
 he was more going into the Malcolm X of things

24:07.800 --> 24:12.200
 and society fears that.

24:12.200 --> 24:15.440
 Yeah, so he was really good at communicating love

24:15.440 --> 24:18.960
 and at starting revolutions.

24:18.960 --> 24:20.080
 Yeah.

24:20.080 --> 24:21.040
 And that's dangerous.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.480
 Very dangerous.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.720
 And they communicated love,

24:24.720 --> 24:26.680
 but he wasn't starting revolutions.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.920
 Well, it's interesting to think about

24:29.920 --> 24:32.680
 what the world would be like if they were still with us.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.360
 But it's the way of the world.

24:35.360 --> 24:39.640
 Hendrix, a lot of those guys just go too soon.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.480
 Yeah, it's a peculiar thing.

24:41.480 --> 24:45.160
 Now, you asked me earlier, am I scared of death?

24:47.280 --> 24:50.080
 And I answered, you know, I'm not scared of death.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.320
 I'm not trying to see it, though.

24:51.320 --> 24:52.680
 You know what I mean?

24:52.680 --> 24:55.240
 It's like, that was the block of death.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.640
 It's like, I'm not really going right there right now.

24:57.640 --> 24:59.960
 I'm making a left or right turn.

24:59.960 --> 25:00.960
 You know what I mean?

25:00.960 --> 25:05.080
 Unless it was mandatory for some greaterness, greater good.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.600
 It's like, okay, I got to drive through that.

25:07.600 --> 25:08.440
 You know what I mean?

25:08.440 --> 25:09.880
 Yeah, but it can still happen.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.760
 That's the meditation on death part,

25:11.760 --> 25:14.320
 where you could die at the end of today.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.240
 Yeah, you could die.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.760
 Well, dying and death, I think,

25:17.760 --> 25:19.720
 is two different things, personally.

25:21.080 --> 25:23.240
 The process you mean of death or just?

25:23.240 --> 25:24.800
 Yeah, I mean, you could die.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.600
 Like I said, you could die every day.

25:26.600 --> 25:29.800
 You could die and not be yourself.

25:29.800 --> 25:30.960
 You know what I mean?

25:30.960 --> 25:32.760
 Which is crazy.

25:32.760 --> 25:35.800
 But to get to a point of no return,

25:35.800 --> 25:38.280
 you know, that's a whole nother chamber.

25:38.280 --> 25:40.080
 I mean, there's some sense in which

25:41.440 --> 25:46.120
 RZA, the producer, becomes somebody else completely

25:46.120 --> 25:47.200
 when you're making a film,

25:47.200 --> 25:49.040
 becomes somebody else completely

25:49.040 --> 25:51.760
 when you're, I don't know, playing chess,

25:51.760 --> 25:53.800
 becomes completely something different

25:53.800 --> 25:57.240
 when you do kung fu or watch kung fu

25:57.240 --> 25:58.720
 or when you're a family man.

25:58.720 --> 25:59.960
 All of those are little deaths

25:59.960 --> 26:02.320
 when you transition from one place to another.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.240
 So it's not like you're one being.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.520
 You're many things.

26:06.520 --> 26:07.400
 Yeah.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.800
 I would describe, now I would describe that

26:08.800 --> 26:10.000
 as all life, dawg.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.640
 Yeah, it's fun.

26:14.120 --> 26:18.200
 Outside of you and anybody on Wu Tang,

26:18.200 --> 26:21.960
 who is the greatest rapper from a lyrics,

26:21.960 --> 26:24.680
 like a Wart Smith perspective in hip hop history

26:24.680 --> 26:27.000
 or some of the greatest, maybe some candidates?

26:27.000 --> 26:28.600
 Let's name a few.

26:28.600 --> 26:31.440
 I mean, you're gonna have to start with Rakim.

26:31.440 --> 26:32.280
 You know?

26:32.280 --> 26:34.640
 You're gonna have to pick Coogee Rap in there.

26:34.640 --> 26:35.680
 You know what I mean?

26:35.680 --> 26:36.640
 So going back.

26:36.640 --> 26:37.960
 Yeah, you're gonna have to pick up

26:37.960 --> 26:38.880
 with those brothers first.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.120
 You might have to, if you want to get,

26:41.120 --> 26:43.840
 technically you might have to start with Grandmaster Cass.

26:43.840 --> 26:44.680
 You know what I mean?

26:44.680 --> 26:46.480
 Who you might not even heard of.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.320
 Nope.

26:47.320 --> 26:48.160
 You know what I mean?

26:48.160 --> 26:49.400
 But you may have sung his lyrics

26:49.400 --> 26:52.080
 every time you sang Sugar Hill, Rapper's Delight.

26:52.080 --> 26:52.920
 That's his?

26:52.920 --> 26:56.760
 Yeah, they copied his and they made it theirs.

26:56.760 --> 27:01.760
 That's my point being made, but I'll name a couple more.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.600
 I gotta pick Nas in that category.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.440
 You know, we got a chess board in front of us

27:07.440 --> 27:10.400
 and one of the greatest chess players,

27:10.400 --> 27:15.400
 the youngest Grandmaster, you know, before I think Carlson,

27:16.520 --> 27:21.520
 was Bobby Fisher.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.480
 All right, so let's use Bobby Fisher as American.

27:23.480 --> 27:25.160
 One of the greatest American chess players.

27:25.160 --> 27:27.720
 Of course, Susan Polgar may have tied his record

27:27.720 --> 27:29.920
 as the youngest Grandmaster

27:29.920 --> 27:32.920
 and she's the youngest female Grandmaster, I think to date.

27:32.920 --> 27:37.520
 But he was a master at what, 14?

27:37.520 --> 27:38.640
 Yeah, something like that.

27:38.640 --> 27:39.520
 Right?

27:39.520 --> 27:44.520
 So now to me, I met Nas when he was 15.

27:44.640 --> 27:46.840
 He was already a master lyricist.

27:46.840 --> 27:49.280
 It takes about 10 years to become a master lyricist.

27:49.280 --> 27:52.800
 So by the time the world heard Wu Tang,

27:52.800 --> 27:55.960
 most of us had 10 years of rapping in us already.

27:55.960 --> 27:58.920
 So that's why you met us at mastery level.

27:58.920 --> 28:02.320
 The Jizzer was already a master when Nas was a master,

28:02.320 --> 28:04.920
 but Jizzer was 21, Nas was 15.

28:06.880 --> 28:09.600
 Nas is like the Mozart of rap.

28:09.600 --> 28:10.800
 Or the Bobby Fisher.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.680
 Just Bobby Fisher, just born something in him.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.280
 Or maybe those early years,

28:15.280 --> 28:20.040
 just because he's not just good at the lyrics.

28:20.040 --> 28:22.680
 He's also, he goes deep with it.

28:22.680 --> 28:23.520
 Just like you.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.320
 So he's like, there's depth.

28:25.320 --> 28:30.320
 It's not just like mastery of the word smithing.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.880
 It's just the message you actually get sent across.

28:34.880 --> 28:35.720
 It's information.

28:35.720 --> 28:36.560
 Yeah.

28:36.560 --> 28:40.680
 Into a small phrase, right?

28:40.680 --> 28:42.160
 That's the whole thing of energy.

28:42.160 --> 28:46.720
 How do we condense all that energy into this

28:46.720 --> 28:49.040
 so that it could fuel that?

28:49.040 --> 28:52.400
 And he's definitely one of those artists,

28:52.400 --> 28:54.200
 MCs that does that.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.480
 And he was doing it at 15.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.120
 Like I said, I think I'm five years

28:58.120 --> 29:00.360
 or four or five years older than Nas.

29:00.360 --> 29:03.240
 So I was always feeling my confidence

29:03.240 --> 29:04.080
 of what I was doing.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.000
 But I was like, this kid is only 15.

29:07.840 --> 29:09.720
 I gotta step up my game.

29:09.720 --> 29:12.960
 When he turned 19, then we got Illmatic.

29:12.960 --> 29:13.800
 Yeah.

29:15.200 --> 29:18.880
 From you, what are the best and most memorable lyrics

29:18.880 --> 29:19.880
 you've ever written?

29:22.120 --> 29:24.160
 Well, that's a hard question for me.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.240
 The stuff stand out?

29:25.240 --> 29:26.560
 Like stuff you're really proud of

29:26.560 --> 29:29.520
 that was like important in your career?

29:29.520 --> 29:34.520
 Yeah, I mean, I think I did a song called Sunshower.

29:35.720 --> 29:38.440
 I don't know if we put it on the Wu Tang Forever double CD,

29:38.440 --> 29:40.800
 but only on the international version.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.560
 But if anybody could go get those lyrics

29:44.560 --> 29:46.040
 and write those lyrics down,

29:46.040 --> 29:47.440
 you could just put that in your pocket.

29:47.440 --> 29:50.080
 And I'm sure that it'll answer at least about 25%

29:50.080 --> 29:51.360
 of your life's problems.

29:52.960 --> 29:53.960
 Well, that's a good one.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.840
 Sunshine, where you talk about religion and God,

29:56.840 --> 29:58.440
 that's good.

29:58.440 --> 29:59.960
 I think it's on A Diagram.

30:01.680 --> 30:02.720
 I'm not a record guy.

30:02.720 --> 30:03.560
 Yeah.

30:03.560 --> 30:04.400
 I'm a song guy.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.240
 Might have been A Diagram.

30:05.240 --> 30:06.520
 Do you have a lyric from it?

30:06.520 --> 30:09.000
 Yeah, the answer to all questions.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.040
 You're talking about God.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.040
 Yeah.

30:11.040 --> 30:14.160
 The spark of all suggestions, of righteousness,

30:14.160 --> 30:16.320
 the pathway to the road of perfection,

30:16.320 --> 30:19.120
 who gives you all and never asks more of you,

30:19.120 --> 30:22.320
 the faithful companion that fights every war with you.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.560
 Before the mortal view of the prehistorical historical,

30:25.560 --> 30:28.440
 he's the all in all you searching for the oracle.

30:28.440 --> 30:29.960
 That's a good line, man.

30:29.960 --> 30:31.720
 This is so good.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.960
 A mission impossible is purely philosophical,

30:33.960 --> 30:36.360
 but you can call on your deathbed

30:36.360 --> 30:37.800
 when you're laying in the hospital.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.440
 You will call on your deathbed.

30:39.440 --> 30:42.880
 I had a big, I have a scientist friend.

30:42.880 --> 30:47.160
 Well, my wife's best friend, Rebecca,

30:47.160 --> 30:48.400
 she married a scientist.

30:48.400 --> 30:49.200
 They both scientists.

30:49.200 --> 30:53.800
 They both were scientists, and she married Dr. Neil.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.680
 I ain't going to say their last names.

30:55.680 --> 31:00.640
 But Neil and Rebecca, my wife's best friend, so they come over.

31:00.640 --> 31:05.280
 And me and Neil, we go through the longest debates

31:05.280 --> 31:07.080
 of science and religion.

31:07.080 --> 31:08.320
 We just go.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.240
 We could go break day with it.

31:10.240 --> 31:18.360
 And before he had a child, he was more adamant.

31:18.360 --> 31:22.080
 And I don't believe in God.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.280
 You know what I mean?

31:23.280 --> 31:25.920
 After a child, he still kept his thing.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.400
 But I just hit him with the question.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.560
 If you was about to die, because now you

31:29.560 --> 31:31.120
 got a child to think about, right?

31:31.120 --> 31:33.440
 It's different when you're thinking about yourself.

31:33.440 --> 31:35.640
 If you was about to die, you don't

31:35.640 --> 31:37.120
 think you're going to make that call.

31:37.120 --> 31:40.400
 He's like, I'll make that call.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.240
 And it kind of inspired my lyric, because it was like,

31:43.240 --> 31:45.840
 yeah, you're going to.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.080
 And I just want to say, as far as you mentioned lyrics,

31:48.080 --> 31:49.560
 that is one of my favorite lyrics.

31:49.560 --> 31:57.240
 But that's part two to Sunshower was the prequel to Sunshine.

31:57.240 --> 32:00.720
 So if you ever get a chance to check out Sunshower,

32:00.720 --> 32:04.120
 start us off with, trouble follows a wicked mind.

32:04.120 --> 32:07.800
 2020 vision of the prism of life,

32:07.800 --> 32:11.160
 but still blind because you lack the inner.

32:11.160 --> 32:14.440
 So every sinner could end up in the everlasting winter

32:14.440 --> 32:16.840
 of hellfire.

32:16.840 --> 32:19.560
 But thorns and splinters prick your eye out.

32:19.560 --> 32:20.440
 You cry out.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.160
 Your words fly out.

32:22.160 --> 32:24.160
 You remain unheard.

32:24.160 --> 32:28.320
 Suffering internal and external,

32:28.320 --> 32:31.480
 along with the wicked fraternal of genitals and kernels,

32:31.480 --> 32:34.400
 letting off thermal nuclear heat that burns you firmly

32:34.400 --> 32:37.800
 and permanently upon the journey through the journal

32:37.800 --> 32:39.480
 of the book of life.

32:39.480 --> 32:41.880
 For those who took a life without justice

32:41.880 --> 32:44.800
 will become just ice.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.800
 It's been taught your worst enemy couldn't harm you

32:47.800 --> 32:51.960
 as much as your own wicked thoughts.

32:51.960 --> 32:55.400
 But people ought to be not unless in war.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.000
 So they find themselves persecuted

32:57.000 --> 33:00.480
 inside their own universal court.

33:00.480 --> 33:02.160
 So it's a long one.

33:02.160 --> 33:03.720
 It's like a three pager.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.080
 Wow, that is about life.

33:05.080 --> 33:10.320
 That's like character integrity, how to be in this world.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.400
 And that ultimately connects to God.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.720
 Yeah.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.480
 Who's God to you?

33:15.480 --> 33:19.680
 I'm glad you just asked that question because I actually,

33:19.680 --> 33:23.680
 I'm going to have to make a distinguishable separation here.

33:23.680 --> 33:24.200
 All right.

33:24.200 --> 33:28.560
 And it's funny because I heard recently,

33:28.560 --> 33:35.480
 I heard a rabbi was debating with this historian, Dr. Ben.

33:35.480 --> 33:38.480
 I can't pronounce Dr. Ben name, but it was debating.

33:38.480 --> 33:42.080
 And in the debate, they started going back

33:42.080 --> 33:44.760
 through the etymology.

33:44.760 --> 33:47.520
 They went way back beyond antiquity

33:47.520 --> 33:48.640
 because they was debating.

33:48.640 --> 33:52.280
 And so there was some things that was going deep.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.920
 And they really went far, far back to kind

33:54.920 --> 33:58.680
 of the first word of God.

33:58.680 --> 34:01.880
 And when they pronounced it on this particular debate,

34:01.880 --> 34:04.040
 it was Allah.

34:04.040 --> 34:07.920
 And they said from that, they got Elohim.

34:07.920 --> 34:11.760
 I've already agreed in my heart and my life

34:11.760 --> 34:18.320
 that the father of this universe, proper name is Allah.

34:18.320 --> 34:23.200
 And of course, in Allah, I get all.

34:23.200 --> 34:28.640
 And I don't think that God is the same as that.

34:28.640 --> 34:33.200
 I think Allah gives birth to God.

34:33.200 --> 34:37.440
 In fact, if you take the word Allah, A L L A H,

34:37.440 --> 34:40.120
 and you take it through numerology or numbers,

34:40.120 --> 34:44.240
 the number letter A being 1, L being 12,

34:44.240 --> 34:49.760
 and you add it all up to the last denominator,

34:49.760 --> 34:51.800
 you're going to get the number 7.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.640
 And the number 7 is going to bring you right back

34:53.640 --> 34:57.000
 to that letter G. So Allah borns God,

34:57.000 --> 34:59.160
 but God don't born Allah.

34:59.160 --> 35:01.480
 How does that guy, how does Allah,

35:01.480 --> 35:05.560
 connect to the oracle that you're

35:05.560 --> 35:08.320
 going to be calling for when you're laying in the hospital?

35:08.320 --> 35:11.240
 Well, what I was saying in that particular verse was that we're

35:11.240 --> 35:12.240
 looking for the oracle.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.960
 We're looking for somebody else or something

35:13.960 --> 35:16.520
 to help us that nobody can really help you

35:16.520 --> 35:17.560
 at the end of the day.

35:21.800 --> 35:24.480
 So now that we, I don't want to say we're speaking on religion,

35:24.480 --> 35:29.400
 but we're speaking on a way of life and a way of thinking.

35:29.400 --> 35:32.200
 And I've read many books, of course.

35:32.200 --> 35:36.240
 And I could say there's no book that my,

35:36.240 --> 35:38.520
 the book that is the most strongest book I've ever read

35:38.520 --> 35:40.320
 is actually the Holy Quran.

35:40.320 --> 35:43.640
 It's stronger to me than the Bible, which I've read.

35:43.640 --> 35:46.720
 It's stronger than quantum physics, which I've read.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.600
 It's stronger than the Bhagavad Gita.

35:48.600 --> 35:52.880
 It's just, and I read once a British scholar

35:52.880 --> 35:56.040
 said it's the most stupidest book ever written.

35:56.040 --> 35:59.640
 And it doesn't make sense.

35:59.640 --> 36:02.240
 And so I said, oh, I see why he says that.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.520
 I understand exactly why he said that as well.

36:04.520 --> 36:05.840
 Why is that?

36:05.840 --> 36:13.280
 Because the structure of the words are just, it's peculiar.

36:13.280 --> 36:14.200
 You know what I mean?

36:14.200 --> 36:16.440
 But it's almost like how some people's songs,

36:16.440 --> 36:18.400
 you don't really know exactly what

36:18.400 --> 36:19.800
 they say until years later.

36:22.760 --> 36:24.720
 Yeah, you have, actually with Joe Rogan,

36:24.720 --> 36:28.040
 I think you talked about how a joke of Dave Chappelle's

36:28.040 --> 36:30.680
 hit you like a long time after this.

36:30.680 --> 36:33.720
 So this is kind of like the Quran.

36:33.720 --> 36:38.760
 I tend to believe that we human beings cannot possibly

36:38.760 --> 36:41.760
 understand anything as big as these ideas.

36:41.760 --> 36:44.680
 So just, I don't know.

36:44.680 --> 36:48.440
 Did you think that, like are you humble in the face

36:48.440 --> 36:51.440
 of just the immensity of it?

36:51.440 --> 36:53.840
 To be honest, yes.

36:53.840 --> 36:57.080
 I'm humble in the face of the, if you could say the word

36:57.080 --> 36:58.800
 again, I pronounce words funny.

36:58.800 --> 37:04.480
 The omnipotence, the omnescence, the magnitude,

37:04.480 --> 37:07.480
 I'm humble in the face of Allah.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.760
 The problem that I may have had was

37:09.760 --> 37:12.000
 that I wasn't humble in the face of God

37:12.000 --> 37:15.960
 because it's just a definable thing.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.640
 And that's why I think a lot of us, and I'm not saying that,

37:18.640 --> 37:22.120
 you know, I know when we say God we're trying to say Allah.

37:22.120 --> 37:24.880
 Like people are saying that, but you're actually

37:24.880 --> 37:27.680
 not saying the same thing because you're actually

37:27.680 --> 37:31.080
 putting something beside him.

37:31.080 --> 37:37.640
 And that's the reason why you can have as many gods.

37:37.640 --> 37:41.040
 You can find a whole bunch of them, you know what I mean?

37:41.040 --> 37:42.320
 But you're not going to find many.

37:42.320 --> 37:45.080
 There's no body beside Allah.

37:45.080 --> 37:45.800
 Allah is one.

37:45.800 --> 37:50.000
 So I know it's a whole thing, but that's my heart is there.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.880
 I'm humbled by it.

37:51.880 --> 37:54.320
 I'm at peace with it.

37:54.320 --> 37:59.160
 And it doesn't take nothing or demerit anything from myself.

37:59.160 --> 38:00.320
 That's the beauty of it.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.360
 It doesn't take nothing from me from being who I feel.

38:03.360 --> 38:06.720
 So if I say, if somebody woke up, yo, peace, God.

38:06.720 --> 38:09.120
 I could take that because they're telling me that, yo,

38:09.120 --> 38:10.200
 I'm a man of wisdom.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.640
 I'm a man of strength.

38:11.640 --> 38:13.800
 I'm a man of beauty.

38:13.800 --> 38:15.760
 Or some attribute of that, you know what I mean?

38:15.760 --> 38:17.760
 So Wu Tang, they the gods of rap.

38:17.760 --> 38:18.640
 There's wisdom there.

38:18.640 --> 38:19.320
 There's strength there.

38:19.320 --> 38:19.840
 There's beauty.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.160
 They will take that.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.240
 Yeah.

38:23.240 --> 38:25.160
 So Wu Tang is one of the greatest

38:25.160 --> 38:29.520
 musical, artistic, philosophical groups ever.

38:29.520 --> 38:31.480
 Let's look hundreds of years from now

38:31.480 --> 38:34.320
 when humans or robots or aliens or whatever that's left here,

38:34.320 --> 38:35.720
 they look back.

38:35.720 --> 38:37.600
 What do you hope they remember about Wu Tang?

38:37.600 --> 38:40.520
 What do you hope the legacy is?

38:40.520 --> 38:43.080
 Well, even if it's thousands of years,

38:43.080 --> 38:45.720
 I hope we don't get rid of the humans.

38:45.720 --> 38:48.040
 But you know, look, whatever happens is going to happen.

38:48.040 --> 38:51.600
 But I think that my philosophy on it

38:51.600 --> 38:59.680
 is that we're going to continue to advance and continue

38:59.680 --> 39:01.960
 to advance things around us.

39:01.960 --> 39:04.600
 But I don't see us becoming extinct.

39:04.600 --> 39:08.080
 Well, I mean, the reason I bring up Wu Tang in that context,

39:08.080 --> 39:11.120
 and this is a special moment in human history.

39:11.120 --> 39:13.840
 It's like 100 years, and we've created all of this music.

39:13.840 --> 39:16.400
 Just if you think of all the richness of music that's

39:16.400 --> 39:18.960
 been created over 100 years, it's

39:18.960 --> 39:21.840
 not obvious to me that that's not going to stop.

39:21.840 --> 39:23.720
 There's a flourishing here.

39:23.720 --> 39:25.960
 So it's funny because I could see

39:25.960 --> 39:29.480
 where the book of human history is written.

39:29.480 --> 39:32.120
 There's a chapter on this period of time.

39:32.120 --> 39:34.680
 And one of the things we did well is

39:34.680 --> 39:39.400
 all the technological innovation with the rockets

39:39.400 --> 39:40.720
 and with the internet.

39:40.720 --> 39:42.520
 But then there's also the musical innovation

39:42.520 --> 39:44.000
 and film innovation.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.760
 Just so much art that's being created.

39:45.760 --> 39:47.960
 And Wu Tang's a huge part of that.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.360
 So I just wonder if there's a few sentences written

39:50.360 --> 39:56.760
 about Wu Tang, it just makes me wonder how they remember.

39:56.760 --> 40:00.520
 I would hope that people, no matter how many years,

40:00.520 --> 40:02.480
 are inspired by us.

40:02.480 --> 40:07.240
 But I will say, if I could just use Wu Tang as itself.

40:07.240 --> 40:15.360
 So we first started off the witty, unpredictable talent

40:15.360 --> 40:16.880
 and natural game.

40:16.880 --> 40:19.600
 Natural game meaning natural wordplay.

40:19.600 --> 40:27.080
 And then we went to the wisdom of the universe,

40:27.080 --> 40:34.400
 the truth of Allah for a nation of God.

40:34.400 --> 40:39.280
 Wisdom, universal, truth, Allah, nation, God.

40:39.280 --> 40:41.400
 So let's just go back to a nation of God.

40:41.400 --> 40:44.680
 Let's just take the last two letters.

40:44.680 --> 40:46.680
 A nation of wisdom, strength, and beauty.

40:50.920 --> 40:53.600
 And I'm going a little political here, but not going political.

40:53.600 --> 40:56.040
 As we'll say, we're the greatest country in the world.

40:56.040 --> 40:58.400
 What makes us the greatest?

40:58.400 --> 40:59.760
 That should be a question we ask.

40:59.760 --> 41:01.760
 Is it our wisdom?

41:01.760 --> 41:03.560
 Is it our strength?

41:03.560 --> 41:04.800
 Is it our beauty?

41:04.800 --> 41:07.520
 Now, let's just say, off the easiest answer,

41:07.520 --> 41:09.400
 you know it's our strength.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.720
 We got the nukes.

41:11.720 --> 41:14.800
 Nobody can really, between America and Russia,

41:14.800 --> 41:17.040
 they say, that's the argument.

41:17.040 --> 41:18.800
 Who could beat them?

41:18.800 --> 41:21.080
 But where's the wisdom?

41:21.080 --> 41:24.680
 Then they can argue, well, we got the technology.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.200
 But then where's the beauty when there's

41:26.200 --> 41:29.480
 so much suffering in the people?

41:29.480 --> 41:30.600
 So it's not complete.

41:30.600 --> 41:33.360
 The hope is that the wisdom is in the founding documents,

41:33.360 --> 41:37.600
 in the imperfect but wise founding documents

41:37.600 --> 41:41.760
 that celebrated freedom, that celebrated all the ideas,

41:41.760 --> 41:45.520
 sort of having a lot of nukes, having a lot of airplanes

41:45.520 --> 41:46.040
 and tanks.

41:49.480 --> 41:50.320
 That's not important.

41:50.320 --> 41:53.800
 And the hope is whatever we're doing here with this, quote,

41:53.800 --> 41:56.680
 greatest country on Earth, that we preserve the ideas

41:56.680 --> 41:59.120
 and help them flourish, just like you said.

41:59.120 --> 42:00.680
 Well, that's what I mean.

42:00.680 --> 42:03.080
 So if you go back to the Wu Tang,

42:03.080 --> 42:05.680
 that's what we're striving for.

42:05.680 --> 42:07.480
 We're striving for that.

42:07.480 --> 42:12.240
 But you started unpredictable and just like, yeah.

42:12.240 --> 42:16.600
 But got deep pretty quick.

42:16.600 --> 42:19.520
 I got to talk to you about Bruce Lee.

42:19.520 --> 42:20.800
 Who's Bruce Lee to you?

42:20.800 --> 42:22.000
 Who is he to the world?

42:22.000 --> 42:27.440
 What ideas of his were interesting to you?

42:27.440 --> 42:29.680
 You talk about Hendrix and music.

42:29.680 --> 42:31.280
 Bruce Lee is that in martial arts.

42:31.280 --> 42:32.920
 He just seems to have changed the game.

42:36.920 --> 42:39.080
 I don't know if the word bold is the right word to say,

42:39.080 --> 42:44.800
 but I wouldn't as bold as to say that he was a minor prophet.

42:44.800 --> 42:47.120
 And I got that concept from the Holy Quran

42:47.120 --> 42:49.040
 where it says that we send prophets

42:49.040 --> 42:52.200
 to every nation, every village.

42:52.200 --> 42:55.320
 We don't let nobody not hear the word in some form

42:55.320 --> 42:57.080
 because it won't be fair.

42:57.080 --> 43:01.960
 And so if a law is merciful, even a man who's deaf

43:01.960 --> 43:03.480
 has to somehow get a sign.

43:03.480 --> 43:05.480
 I don't know if Moses saw a burning bush.

43:05.480 --> 43:06.920
 There was nobody else to talk to,

43:06.920 --> 43:08.280
 so he had to talk to the bush.

43:08.280 --> 43:09.160
 I don't know.

43:09.160 --> 43:11.520
 It could have been the bush this way too, right?

43:11.520 --> 43:15.040
 But point being made, it says that they are minor prophets.

43:15.040 --> 43:17.560
 And I see Bruce Lee as one of them

43:17.560 --> 43:22.840
 because what he brought to the world through martial art

43:22.840 --> 43:27.080
 was a whole shift in the dynamic of thinking.

43:27.080 --> 43:30.640
 And that happens when certain entities are born.

43:30.640 --> 43:36.600
 But he didn't do it only in a physical sense.

43:36.600 --> 43:38.560
 He was also for the philosophizing

43:38.560 --> 43:41.680
 in the same process.

43:41.680 --> 43:45.960
 And he was also striving to be the best of himself.

43:45.960 --> 43:48.720
 So you got three things going on.

43:48.720 --> 43:54.120
 I studied Bruce Lee multiple times.

43:54.120 --> 44:00.920
 And first, of course, when I saw my first Kung Fu movie,

44:00.920 --> 44:03.440
 it wasn't really Bruce Lee.

44:03.440 --> 44:07.480
 It was a few Green Hornet clips cut together.

44:07.480 --> 44:08.960
 And then I saw Black Samurai.

44:08.960 --> 44:13.400
 Then my following Kung Fu movies was like Fearless Fighters,

44:13.400 --> 44:17.320
 the Ghostly Face, the Fist of Double K.

44:17.320 --> 44:19.800
 But basically, in Fearless Fighters,

44:19.800 --> 44:21.480
 the lady put the little kid on her back

44:21.480 --> 44:25.880
 and flew across the ocean, across the lake, right?

44:25.880 --> 44:28.000
 So Bruce wasn't doing that.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.680
 And then I went on to Five Deadly Venoms, and Spearman,

44:31.680 --> 44:32.720
 and 36 Chambers.

44:32.720 --> 44:39.800
 And these movies are beautiful, and yet they're all heightened.

44:39.800 --> 44:42.960
 Bruce, they're heightened beyond doable.

44:42.960 --> 44:43.760
 You're not going to.

44:43.760 --> 44:44.640
 Yeah, it's surreal.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.480
 They play with the world that's not of this world.

44:47.480 --> 44:48.880
 Yeah.

44:48.880 --> 44:51.200
 Bruce played with this world.

44:51.200 --> 44:55.600
 So when I first saw Bruce, I actually

44:55.600 --> 44:57.840
 didn't think he was as good as these guys.

44:57.840 --> 45:00.520
 He can't fly.

45:00.520 --> 45:03.760
 He's not flying in the movies, right?

45:03.760 --> 45:07.080
 But then when I saw, because the first one I saw

45:07.080 --> 45:11.240
 was The Big Boss, which they retitled Fist of Fury.

45:11.240 --> 45:15.160
 But then when I saw Chinese Connection, which

45:15.160 --> 45:19.280
 is the real Fist of Fury, right?

45:19.280 --> 45:21.280
 I saw something different there.

45:21.280 --> 45:24.280
 And I got enamored.

45:24.280 --> 45:26.400
 And then, of course, Enter the Dragon, right?

45:26.400 --> 45:28.080
 Just really complete.

45:28.080 --> 45:32.080
 That's why my first album was Enter the Wu Tang,

45:32.080 --> 45:33.520
 36 Chambers of Shaolin.

45:33.520 --> 45:35.560
 So it's Enter the Dragon and 36 put together,

45:35.560 --> 45:38.320
 because those are the two epitomes.

45:38.320 --> 45:40.280
 So what happened is that's young me.

45:40.280 --> 45:43.320
 Then teenage me studies him again.

45:43.320 --> 45:46.760
 And I realized, wow, look at his physicality.

45:46.760 --> 45:50.840
 Look how he's really moving for real.

45:50.840 --> 45:52.360
 And then I studied him again.

45:52.360 --> 45:55.000
 Wow, look at what he's saying.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
 Then I studied him again.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.800
 Wow, look at what he stands for.

45:59.800 --> 46:04.640
 Which do you like in the realm of martial arts, the real

46:04.640 --> 46:07.800
 or the surreal, or the dance between the two?

46:07.800 --> 46:09.320
 Yeah, I like the dance between the two,

46:09.320 --> 46:15.640
 because a movie, to me, is to entertain you.

46:15.640 --> 46:23.480
 So I'm cool with Obi Wan Kenobi disappearing out of the cloak

46:23.480 --> 46:25.960
 when Vader strikes him down.

46:25.960 --> 46:27.560
 And then I'm like, yo, what happened?

46:27.560 --> 46:30.280
 And he's like, run, Luke, run.

46:30.280 --> 46:31.840
 I'm cool with that, right?

46:31.840 --> 46:34.120
 Because that's the imagination.

46:34.120 --> 46:36.520
 And the imagination gets stimulated to the point

46:36.520 --> 46:40.200
 to where as things that we saw imagined by an artist,

46:40.200 --> 46:42.280
 we strive to create in our real world.

46:42.280 --> 46:47.720
 Thus, Star Trek, to me, is just a precursor to our cell phones.

46:47.720 --> 46:51.880
 So for me, I like to mix the two.

46:51.880 --> 46:54.360
 Yeah, it's funny how science fiction pushing

46:54.360 --> 46:57.640
 into the impossible actually makes it realize eventually.

46:57.640 --> 47:00.520
 We humans, once we see an idea on screen,

47:00.520 --> 47:02.920
 no matter how wild it is, we're trying to make it.

47:02.920 --> 47:04.040
 Yeah, we're trying to make it.

47:04.040 --> 47:06.680
 Some weird young kid, he gets inspired and watch that.

47:06.680 --> 47:08.280
 Be like, I'm going to build that.

47:08.280 --> 47:09.040
 Exactly.

47:09.040 --> 47:11.600
 So I don't know who's going to come with the Back

47:11.600 --> 47:13.040
 to the Future time machine.

47:13.040 --> 47:15.440
 But do you have any classmates that you think

47:15.440 --> 47:17.880
 this is going to be a time machine?

47:17.880 --> 47:20.360
 I thought you were going to Back to the Future, like the,

47:20.360 --> 47:24.000
 what is it, the hoverboard?

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
 Or like the, uh?

47:25.000 --> 47:26.520
 Yeah, at least.

47:26.520 --> 47:29.600
 Somebody, they got, you see the one on the water?

47:29.600 --> 47:30.240
 No.

47:30.240 --> 47:33.200
 No, you know the surf hover?

47:33.200 --> 47:34.400
 It's dope.

47:34.400 --> 47:35.200
 Nice.

47:35.200 --> 47:36.000
 It's dope.

47:36.000 --> 47:40.200
 It actually, if you are a Back to the Future fan,

47:40.200 --> 47:43.040
 you feel like you made it to, you made it there.

47:43.040 --> 47:43.840
 Yeah.

47:43.840 --> 47:46.160
 Well, now we just got to work on the time trial.

47:46.160 --> 47:49.960
 And it was cool to hear you talk about the Master of the Flying

47:49.960 --> 47:57.040
 Gaijin today, that that inspired the lyric for the Wu Tang

47:57.040 --> 47:58.800
 client, Nothing to F with.

47:58.800 --> 48:00.000
 Yeah.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.240
 How does that go again?

48:02.240 --> 48:03.640
 What, the curse word or the lyric?

48:03.640 --> 48:04.440
 Nothing.

48:04.440 --> 48:05.240
 OK.

48:05.240 --> 48:06.280
 No, I remember the curse.

48:06.280 --> 48:09.800
 I am Russian, but the lyric.

48:09.800 --> 48:12.480
 I said, I be tossing and forcing.

48:12.480 --> 48:13.840
 My style is awesome.

48:13.840 --> 48:17.200
 I'm causing more family feuds than Richard Dawson.

48:17.200 --> 48:20.080
 And the survey said, you're dead.

48:20.080 --> 48:23.400
 The fatal flying guillotine chops off your head.

48:23.400 --> 48:24.200
 Yeah.

48:24.200 --> 48:25.000
 Yeah.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.760
 And it was interesting to see the guillotine in the movie

48:27.760 --> 48:32.040
 today, how, I don't know.

48:32.040 --> 48:33.720
 That's surreal, right?

48:33.720 --> 48:34.520
 But it's not.

48:34.520 --> 48:36.640
 It's like, it's engineering.

48:36.640 --> 48:42.360
 It's both surreal and it just, and it adds this chaos

48:42.360 --> 48:44.920
 into this real world that, and then challenges everybody

48:44.920 --> 48:46.520
 to think what you're going to do with that.

48:46.520 --> 48:46.840
 Yeah.

48:46.840 --> 48:47.680
 How are you going to beat it?

48:47.680 --> 48:48.000
 Yeah.

48:48.000 --> 48:48.720
 How are you going to beat it?

48:48.720 --> 48:51.440
 Both when you have like the good and the evil

48:51.440 --> 48:54.280
 and the mix of the bad guys and good guys

48:54.280 --> 48:56.120
 and you're not sure who the bad guys are.

48:56.120 --> 48:58.520
 It's the old question of good versus evil, right?

48:58.520 --> 48:59.240
 Yeah.

48:59.240 --> 49:03.080
 Like you said, then the question of who was good, who was evil.

49:03.080 --> 49:07.560
 But they all had a similar problem when the guillotine came.

49:07.560 --> 49:11.000
 But in terms of the real, you mentioned The Godfather,

49:11.000 --> 49:12.280
 good and evil.

49:12.280 --> 49:13.600
 That's your favorite movie.

49:13.600 --> 49:14.640
 Yeah.

49:14.640 --> 49:16.120
 What makes it great, do you think?

49:16.120 --> 49:20.360
 The characters, the study of family, of justice, of power.

49:20.360 --> 49:21.280
 What connects with you?

49:21.280 --> 49:25.160
 Oh, oh, I mean, every one of those themes

49:25.160 --> 49:29.960
 connects in the real and it connects in a cinematic way

49:29.960 --> 49:31.760
 as well.

49:31.760 --> 49:34.360
 The difference, I think, with me and The Godfather

49:34.360 --> 49:36.320
 was I've seen it during a period of time

49:36.320 --> 49:38.720
 when my father was absent.

49:38.720 --> 49:44.160
 And therefore, family structure and family values

49:44.160 --> 49:49.200
 was actually adopted in my family because of that.

49:49.200 --> 49:54.480
 Me and my brother Devon, we actually

49:54.480 --> 49:59.040
 took so much heed to that movie and our family life.

49:59.040 --> 50:08.040
 And we kind of mimic that family in its structure of somebody

50:08.040 --> 50:10.280
 has to be the leader of the family,

50:10.280 --> 50:11.320
 even if it was the younger.

50:11.320 --> 50:14.960
 Michael was younger than Sonny and Fragile.

50:14.960 --> 50:15.760
 You know what I mean?

50:15.760 --> 50:17.360
 But he was worthy.

50:17.360 --> 50:19.240
 And my brother Devon is older than me.

50:19.240 --> 50:20.800
 My brother King is older than me.

50:20.800 --> 50:23.400
 And it's funny, sometimes Devon calls King Fragile.

50:23.400 --> 50:24.760
 And I know King wants to.

50:24.760 --> 50:26.960
 King was actually, he actually was,

50:26.960 --> 50:30.320
 he said he could beat our ass, to use my language.

50:30.320 --> 50:31.440
 But you're Michael.

50:31.440 --> 50:32.640
 Yeah.

50:32.640 --> 50:38.720
 And not by choice, just by definition of that's what I am.

50:38.720 --> 50:40.480
 You know what I mean?

50:40.480 --> 50:44.920
 And it's just a blessing for me to have my older sister,

50:44.920 --> 50:52.760
 my older brothers, and my younger brothers look to me as,

50:52.760 --> 50:55.520
 just as a good light in the family.

50:55.520 --> 50:57.920
 And like I said, that movie helped us.

50:57.920 --> 51:01.120
 My sisters, too, we, the cool thing about my family,

51:01.120 --> 51:02.960
 I don't know if I share this a lot,

51:02.960 --> 51:05.720
 it's a big, we all watched these movies together.

51:05.720 --> 51:10.080
 And so the A Diagram, Pole Fighter, Master Killer,

51:10.080 --> 51:12.400
 Five Deadly Venoms, my family knows these movies.

51:12.400 --> 51:15.800
 It's not just I know them.

51:15.800 --> 51:19.920
 And then you extend it further, my friends know them, too.

51:19.920 --> 51:26.160
 So there's a language that we all can have that actually film

51:26.160 --> 51:29.080
 has informed our communication.

51:29.080 --> 51:34.600
 So The Godfather, which also is still a fictitional story

51:34.600 --> 51:39.880
 of something, but since it was based in reality,

51:39.880 --> 51:42.680
 based on something real, and it was human,

51:42.680 --> 51:48.120
 it wasn't so heightened, I think the purity of it resonates.

51:48.120 --> 51:50.160
 And the purity of it is something

51:50.160 --> 51:53.000
 that resonates with me.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.240
 You got to plan ahead.

51:56.240 --> 51:58.960
 He didn't want to deal with the drugs,

51:58.960 --> 52:02.240
 but that time of business was upon him.

52:02.240 --> 52:05.320
 It's like, it's almost like, this is a tough one,

52:05.320 --> 52:08.200
 like sometimes when the Muslim brothers come from the Middle

52:08.200 --> 52:14.440
 East to America and they open up delis, they would sell ham.

52:14.440 --> 52:17.160
 And we would go in there and complain to them,

52:17.160 --> 52:19.760
 and make them like, they used to get mad at us

52:19.760 --> 52:20.920
 when we came in.

52:20.920 --> 52:22.360
 But that's as a kid.

52:22.360 --> 52:25.600
 But as a man, I'm like, yo, he's here to sell.

52:25.600 --> 52:28.360
 Now, he still don't have to sell to him.

52:28.360 --> 52:32.280
 Vito Corleone didn't want to sell the drugs.

52:32.280 --> 52:33.320
 He didn't have to do it.

52:33.320 --> 52:34.560
 He didn't do it.

52:34.560 --> 52:37.000
 And it cost him some bullets to eventually,

52:37.000 --> 52:42.000
 somebody in the family ended up doing it.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.880
 What about this idea that it's family before everything else?

52:45.880 --> 52:52.120
 So there's different laws you live according to in this world,

52:52.120 --> 52:54.080
 and family is first.

52:54.080 --> 52:55.240
 Yeah.

52:55.240 --> 52:59.720
 That's mathematically correct.

52:59.720 --> 53:01.280
 I like that.

53:01.280 --> 53:06.800
 I mean, there's a certain sense of you look at powerful people.

53:06.800 --> 53:08.360
 You look at Putin.

53:08.360 --> 53:10.920
 There's a certain sense in which the people who

53:10.920 --> 53:13.680
 are in the inner circle, that's who you take care of.

53:13.680 --> 53:14.880
 That's family.

53:14.880 --> 53:18.080
 And anyone else that crosses you,

53:18.080 --> 53:21.840
 that there's a different set of ethics under which you

53:21.840 --> 53:23.760
 operate for those people.

53:23.760 --> 53:28.440
 Well, Jesus said the same thing.

53:28.440 --> 53:30.440
 When he said, love thy neighbor and thy brother,

53:30.440 --> 53:32.680
 he was talking about that community.

53:32.680 --> 53:37.720
 When that other lady, the Samaritan, say, hey, Jesus,

53:37.720 --> 53:39.840
 my brother not feeling so well, and he said,

53:39.840 --> 53:42.400
 give not that which is holy unto the dogs.

53:42.400 --> 53:46.200
 If you're going to tell a woman, give not

53:46.200 --> 53:48.760
 that which is holy unto the dogs.

53:48.760 --> 53:49.520
 And she's a woman.

53:49.520 --> 53:51.760
 He just called her a dog.

53:51.760 --> 53:55.680
 If I translate that into hip hop, she's a female.

53:55.680 --> 53:57.160
 He called her a dog.

53:57.160 --> 53:58.840
 I know how that goes.

53:58.840 --> 54:02.360
 But she said to him, but even a dog

54:02.360 --> 54:04.560
 is allowed to eat the crumbs that

54:04.560 --> 54:07.960
 falls from the master's table.

54:07.960 --> 54:09.520
 And he went and helped.

54:09.520 --> 54:10.160
 He helped her.

54:10.160 --> 54:12.560
 Now, let's go back to what you just said about Putin

54:12.560 --> 54:15.400
 or Vito Corleone or myself and my family.

54:15.400 --> 54:17.760
 Of course, the family is first.

54:17.760 --> 54:20.680
 But once the family is good, it has

54:20.680 --> 54:23.320
 to then spread to the community, then

54:23.320 --> 54:27.800
 to the state, country, world.

54:27.800 --> 54:29.600
 The problem we have sometimes is that,

54:29.600 --> 54:31.800
 and this is the reason why a lot of powerful families

54:31.800 --> 54:33.920
 was overthrown, like why do they behead

54:33.920 --> 54:36.440
 their own king with the guillotine, right?

54:36.440 --> 54:40.400
 Because once the family was strong,

54:40.400 --> 54:48.640
 they didn't let the wealth, the opportunity expand out.

54:48.640 --> 54:53.400
 You look at Wu Tang, yes, our family was made strong first.

54:53.400 --> 54:56.280
 But then all the Wu members were able to form

54:56.280 --> 54:57.840
 their own corporations.

54:57.840 --> 55:00.320
 And they had their own subfamilies.

55:00.320 --> 55:01.400
 It has to grow out.

55:01.400 --> 55:03.120
 And they took over the world.

55:03.120 --> 55:05.960
 You've talked about being vegan.

55:05.960 --> 55:09.640
 I don't think I heard you explain this,

55:09.640 --> 55:14.800
 because it connects somehow about how you think about life.

55:14.800 --> 55:16.880
 So you talk about when your family's good,

55:16.880 --> 55:19.240
 you grow that circle of empathy.

55:19.240 --> 55:21.280
 You grow the community.

55:21.280 --> 55:24.720
 Is that how you think about being vegan,

55:24.720 --> 55:29.720
 that just the capacity of living beings on Earth to suffer,

55:29.720 --> 55:33.400
 that you just don't want to add suffering to them?

55:33.400 --> 55:36.360
 Yeah, I mean, you said it clear.

55:36.360 --> 55:40.800
 It's like nothing, in all reality,

55:40.800 --> 55:42.880
 I came to a realization that nothing really

55:42.880 --> 55:46.160
 has to die for me to live.

55:46.160 --> 55:47.120
 No animal.

55:47.120 --> 55:49.520
 The plants themselves, right?

55:49.520 --> 55:53.960
 So let's just say you want a steak, which is probably

55:53.960 --> 55:57.280
 the most, I don't know, the most expensive piece of meat.

55:57.280 --> 56:01.360
 But let's just say the steak is top of the line, nice steak.

56:01.360 --> 56:03.560
 And you're eating the steak for the protein to help

56:03.560 --> 56:05.200
 build your muscle.

56:05.200 --> 56:07.640
 And I don't know if you got it from a cow or a bull,

56:07.640 --> 56:09.480
 but whether it's a cow or a bull,

56:09.480 --> 56:11.920
 they grow to about 1,500 pounds.

56:11.920 --> 56:16.520
 And if it's a bull, it's all muscly muscle.

56:16.520 --> 56:17.840
 And it's only eating grass.

56:20.920 --> 56:22.040
 Yeah.

56:22.040 --> 56:26.760
 Yeah, it's possible to, both as an athlete

56:26.760 --> 56:28.880
 and just as a human being, to perform well

56:28.880 --> 56:29.880
 without eating meat.

56:29.880 --> 56:32.520
 That's something, especially in the way

56:32.520 --> 56:37.520
 we're treating animals, to deliver that meat to the plate.

56:37.600 --> 56:38.600
 I think about that a lot.

56:38.600 --> 56:42.120
 So I do, I'm a robotics person, AI person.

56:42.120 --> 56:44.800
 And I think a lot about, I don't know if you think

56:44.800 --> 56:47.320
 about this kind of stuff, but building AI systems

56:47.320 --> 56:49.880
 as they become more and more humanlike,

56:49.880 --> 56:52.720
 you start to ask the question of, are we okay?

56:55.360 --> 56:59.000
 If we give the capacity for AI systems to suffer,

56:59.000 --> 57:01.440
 first to feel, but then to suffer,

57:02.440 --> 57:05.760
 to hate and to love, to feel emotion,

57:05.760 --> 57:07.560
 how do we deal with that?

57:07.560 --> 57:11.000
 It starts asking the same question as you ask of animals.

57:11.000 --> 57:14.560
 Are we okay adding that suffering to the world?

57:14.560 --> 57:15.720
 Right.

57:15.720 --> 57:17.520
 And I don't think we should add the suffering

57:17.520 --> 57:19.400
 because it's not necessary.

57:19.400 --> 57:22.400
 Like, look, if it's necessary, right,

57:22.400 --> 57:25.400
 because we're survival or the first law of nature,

57:25.400 --> 57:28.840
 self preservation, if you are in a desert

57:28.840 --> 57:30.120
 and there's nothing else to eat,

57:30.120 --> 57:33.640
 but that lizard, yeah, okay, you gotta do what you gotta do.

57:33.640 --> 57:34.680
 Lizard's gotta go.

57:34.680 --> 57:36.400
 Yeah, you gotta go, you gotta do what you gotta do.

57:36.400 --> 57:38.840
 Because at the end of the day, man is,

57:38.840 --> 57:41.800
 when they say man has dominion over these things,

57:41.800 --> 57:45.520
 his dominion is almost like a caretaker.

57:45.520 --> 57:48.080
 The way we do our dominion, we dominate it,

57:48.080 --> 57:49.760
 eat it, cook it.

57:49.760 --> 57:53.760
 Like who's the first guy that looked at the lobster?

57:53.760 --> 57:56.400
 He was like, I'm gonna eat this thing.

57:56.400 --> 57:59.000
 Like, first of all, it's hard to eat it.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.480
 You gotta go through a process to get that.

58:01.480 --> 58:04.440
 A crab, I remember we used to eat crabs when we was kids

58:04.440 --> 58:06.720
 and I didn't know why I was always getting itchy throats

58:06.720 --> 58:09.000
 and all that, you know, you don't know, just eat.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.800
 But at the end of the day, a crab didn't provide

58:11.800 --> 58:15.680
 no more than a finger worth of meat maybe.

58:15.680 --> 58:18.760
 And it was hell getting that thing, getting it out.

58:18.760 --> 58:20.880
 It's like, it's not worth it in all reality.

58:20.880 --> 58:25.960
 You could have gave me a banana

58:25.960 --> 58:30.760
 and did better for my body and my appetite

58:30.760 --> 58:33.840
 and my being fulfilled as full.

58:33.840 --> 58:38.880
 Like, look at the blessings of life, right?

58:38.880 --> 58:45.480
 If you take a seed or you get an apple and you eat it,

58:45.480 --> 58:49.240
 in that apple is multiple seeds in it.

58:49.240 --> 58:53.040
 If you plant that seed, it'll give you a whole tree

58:53.040 --> 58:56.760
 with a whole bunch of apples with all multiple seeds.

58:56.760 --> 59:02.120
 But if you kill a fish, it can't reproduce, it's done.

59:02.120 --> 59:04.840
 If you kill a, it's done, it's nothing coming back.

59:04.840 --> 59:07.000
 But when you deal with the plants,

59:07.000 --> 59:11.760
 even after you eat the apple and then you defecate,

59:11.760 --> 59:14.400
 your defecation is what feeds the ground

59:14.400 --> 59:16.200
 to cause the apple to grow more.

59:16.200 --> 59:18.000
 Yeah, it's a circle of life.

59:18.000 --> 59:21.280
 And especially there's a guy named David Foster Wallace,

59:21.280 --> 59:24.560
 he wrote a short story called Consider the Lobster.

59:24.560 --> 59:27.800
 If you actually think philosophically about what,

59:27.800 --> 59:30.680
 from a perspective of a lobster,

59:30.680 --> 59:32.240
 that's like symbolic of something

59:32.240 --> 59:36.880
 because you're basically put in the water, like cold water,

59:36.880 --> 59:41.160
 and then it heats up slowly until it's no more.

59:41.160 --> 59:43.040
 It's torture, yeah, it must have been like,

59:43.040 --> 59:44.440
 do you think they started eating lobsters

59:44.440 --> 59:45.840
 in the Inquisition?

59:45.840 --> 59:47.920
 Yeah, they just enjoy,

59:47.920 --> 59:50.040
 they would probably enjoy torturing animals

59:50.040 --> 59:51.600
 and they realize they're also delicious

59:51.600 --> 59:52.840
 after the torture is finished,

59:52.840 --> 59:54.880
 that's probably how they discovered it.

59:54.880 --> 59:55.840
 Let me ask you a question,

59:55.840 --> 59:56.960
 I know you're asking me the questions,

59:56.960 --> 59:58.920
 but I just wanna talk a little bit about the AI,

59:58.920 --> 1:00:01.320
 and you said something about trying to

1:00:01.320 --> 1:00:03.760
 put the emotion in it, right?

1:00:07.120 --> 1:00:10.880
 So are you thinking there's an algorithm for emotion?

1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:15.680
 Yes, but I think emotion isn't something

1:00:15.680 --> 1:00:19.480
 that there's an algorithm for for a particular system,

1:00:19.480 --> 1:00:21.400
 we create emotions together.

1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:25.440
 So emotion is something like this conversation,

1:00:25.440 --> 1:00:27.560
 it's like magic we create together.

1:00:27.560 --> 1:00:30.880
 So I've worked with quite a few robots,

1:00:30.880 --> 1:00:33.000
 I've a very simple version of that,

1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.120
 I've had Roomba vacuum cleaners,

1:00:36.080 --> 1:00:37.680
 I've had them make different sounds

1:00:37.680 --> 1:00:41.160
 and one of them is like screaming in pain, like lightly,

1:00:41.160 --> 1:00:43.120
 and just having them do that when you kick them

1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:44.520
 or when they run into stuff,

1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:47.800
 immediately I start to feel something for them.

1:00:47.800 --> 1:00:50.360
 So the emotion, okay, so the emotion you're saying

1:00:50.360 --> 1:00:53.240
 is imposed back on the human,

1:00:53.240 --> 1:00:55.440
 but I'm asking, do you think there's an algorithm

1:00:55.440 --> 1:00:58.960
 for the emotion to be imposed from machine to machine?

1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:01.680
 Yeah, that's a really good way to ask it.

1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:06.920
 It's difficult because I think ultimately

1:01:06.920 --> 1:01:09.240
 I only know how to exist in the human world.

1:01:09.240 --> 1:01:11.040
 So it's like, it's the question of

1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:13.960
 if a tree falls in the forest, nobody's there to see it,

1:01:13.960 --> 1:01:15.400
 does it still fall?

1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:19.440
 I still think that ultimately machines will have to

1:01:20.760 --> 1:01:22.640
 show emotion to other humans

1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:24.280
 and that's when it becomes real.

1:01:24.280 --> 1:01:26.480
 I've been thinking about this a lot too.

1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:29.520
 And I just, okay.

1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:32.200
 No, I'm not gonna hit you with this

1:01:32.200 --> 1:01:33.040
 because I've been thinking about this

1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:34.560
 and this is your field here.

1:01:36.680 --> 1:01:38.720
 Well, do you think the emotion is wave?

1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:43.720
 Like light is wave or do you think it's particle?

1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:47.640
 So emotion is just a small,

1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:49.360
 it's like a shadow of something bigger.

1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:52.000
 And I think that bigger thing is consciousness.

1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:53.720
 So emotion is just.

1:01:53.720 --> 1:01:55.280
 I don't know if it's a wave or a particle.

1:01:55.280 --> 1:01:57.280
 I haven't thought about that.

1:01:59.120 --> 1:02:00.880
 I have thought about it, whether it's,

1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:04.400
 there's something like whether consciousness

1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:06.640
 or emotion is a law of physics.

1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:09.560
 Like if it's that fundamental to the universe.

1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:14.240
 I had a lyric that said this, it comes out.

1:02:14.240 --> 1:02:15.760
 They did this documentary about the planet

1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:19.560
 and I wrote a song, it's called The World of Confusion.

1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:21.280
 And I'll try to paraphrase the lyric,

1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:22.720
 but in the world of the confusion,

1:02:22.720 --> 1:02:23.960
 where there's so much illusions,

1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:26.480
 we suck the blood from the planet.

1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:28.320
 Now it needs a transfusion

1:02:28.320 --> 1:02:30.320
 and the redistribution of wealth,

1:02:31.520 --> 1:02:35.320
 of health and wealth of self

1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:38.440
 and a deeper understanding about mental health.

1:02:39.640 --> 1:02:43.600
 The doctor prescribed the physical solution.

1:02:45.440 --> 1:02:49.800
 The psychiatrist wants to build a bigger institution,

1:02:51.040 --> 1:02:55.320
 but neither have the solution or the equation

1:02:56.200 --> 1:02:58.840
 to make an instrument to measure

1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:02.200
 the weight of the hate vibration.

1:03:02.200 --> 1:03:05.600
 What is the weight of hate?

1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:08.560
 Is it heavier than the weight of love?

1:03:10.400 --> 1:03:15.320
 Is it heavier than the weight of lead inside of a slug?

1:03:15.320 --> 1:03:19.080
 With just 10 milligrams, it's all it takes to kill a man.

1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:20.560
 But anyways, do not go on from there.

1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:21.800
 Damn, that's good.

1:03:21.800 --> 1:03:23.920
 But the question, you see the question there, right?

1:03:23.920 --> 1:03:26.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, can it be measured?

1:03:26.400 --> 1:03:27.560
 Can that be measured?

1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:29.480
 I think so, I think so.

1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:30.960
 Just look at the instrument, yeah.

1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:35.240
 Yeah, we're in the dark ages of that,

1:03:35.240 --> 1:03:36.360
 but I think it could be measured.

1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:39.120
 I think there's something physical,

1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:42.200
 like something that connects us all this much.

1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:44.920
 We tend to think we humans are distinct entities

1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:46.120
 and we move about this world,

1:03:46.120 --> 1:03:48.880
 but I think there's some deeper connection.

1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:53.320
 And, but we're so, listen, science is in the,

1:03:53.320 --> 1:03:55.920
 we just had a few breakthroughs in the past 100 years

1:03:55.920 --> 1:03:58.880
 from Einstein on the theoretical physics side.

1:03:58.880 --> 1:04:00.880
 We don't know anything about human psychology.

1:04:00.880 --> 1:04:03.800
 We barely know much about human biology.

1:04:03.800 --> 1:04:05.720
 We're trying to figure it all out.

1:04:05.720 --> 1:04:08.680
 Yeah, I had another theory,

1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:12.840
 because, you know, you think about quantum, right?

1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:16.520
 As long as you say that there's an uncertainty

1:04:18.200 --> 1:04:20.280
 and you have me believe there's an uncertainty,

1:04:20.280 --> 1:04:22.200
 then there's an uncertainty.

1:04:22.200 --> 1:04:25.240
 But if there's not an uncertainty, what happens?

1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:28.480
 So I'm only saying that, it's not,

1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:29.960
 because you look at quantum computers,

1:04:29.960 --> 1:04:32.760
 they're gonna give you the O, the one,

1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:35.440
 the one, the O, they're gonna take two things

1:04:35.440 --> 1:04:36.440
 and make it eight things.

1:04:36.440 --> 1:04:39.360
 And by the time you multiply four of those things together,

1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:41.200
 it's like this chess board, right?

1:04:41.200 --> 1:04:44.080
 The moves goes into the millions.

1:04:44.080 --> 1:04:49.080
 But the thing that's introduced is the uncertainty, right?

1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:52.560
 You're gonna make a move.

1:04:52.560 --> 1:04:57.560
 You know this already, right?

1:05:00.920 --> 1:05:04.040
 Because this has been played a thousand times,

1:05:04.040 --> 1:05:06.600
 but sooner or later, something uncertain is gonna come in

1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:08.440
 or make your next move.

1:05:13.960 --> 1:05:15.920
 I like the weight of these.

1:05:15.920 --> 1:05:18.320
 They add the certainty.

1:05:18.320 --> 1:05:20.600
 I think just like what we were saying, unpredictable,

1:05:20.600 --> 1:05:22.800
 there's something about us humans

1:05:22.800 --> 1:05:25.720
 that really doesn't like everything to be fully predictable.

1:05:25.720 --> 1:05:30.640
 I mean, chess too is perfectly solvable.

1:05:30.640 --> 1:05:32.840
 There's nothing unpredictable about chess.

1:05:32.840 --> 1:05:34.440
 Right, well, I could agree to that

1:05:34.440 --> 1:05:39.440
 because Bobby Fischer said in one of his books,

1:05:39.680 --> 1:05:41.440
 which I actually love what he said.

1:05:42.520 --> 1:05:46.560
 He said, every game of chess is a draw.

1:05:48.360 --> 1:05:49.640
 Yeah.

1:05:49.640 --> 1:05:52.840
 The only way somebody win is when one of us makes a mistake.

1:05:54.880 --> 1:05:56.200
 I mean, it doesn't get any better than that.

1:05:56.200 --> 1:05:57.200
 Yeah, it doesn't.

1:05:57.200 --> 1:05:59.320
 What is chess?

1:05:59.320 --> 1:06:00.520
 Like, how do you think about chess?

1:06:00.520 --> 1:06:02.440
 What's at the core of your interest in chess?

1:06:02.440 --> 1:06:07.440
 Do you see Kung Fu, music, film, all of it, life,

1:06:07.720 --> 1:06:09.800
 all just living through chess?

1:06:09.800 --> 1:06:14.800
 Yeah, I see, it's the most stimulating passage of time

1:06:14.800 --> 1:06:19.800
 for me that's also, it's like, it's a pastime

1:06:21.240 --> 1:06:24.800
 that stimulates my mind, my music,

1:06:24.800 --> 1:06:27.120
 my thoughts about life at the same time.

1:06:27.120 --> 1:06:28.680
 So while some pastimes is like,

1:06:28.680 --> 1:06:30.640
 say baseball is a pastime.

1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:31.640
 And baseball could stimulate you

1:06:31.640 --> 1:06:32.880
 depending on how you look at it, right?

1:06:32.880 --> 1:06:36.000
 But most likely, you're not gonna get

1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:39.480
 this much brain activation, this much calculation,

1:06:39.480 --> 1:06:41.280
 and this much thinking about yourself

1:06:42.320 --> 1:06:43.960
 in a game of baseball.

1:06:43.960 --> 1:06:47.640
 I mean, the player maybe, but not the viewer.

1:06:47.640 --> 1:06:51.000
 Chess is something that I can engage in too.

1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.320
 And even though it's a pastime,

1:06:54.520 --> 1:06:59.120
 it's given me all the stimulation of real time in my life.

1:06:59.120 --> 1:07:02.280
 It's funny because it's also, it's a funny game

1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:06.920
 because it's connected through centuries of play.

1:07:06.920 --> 1:07:09.520
 Just some of the most interesting people

1:07:09.520 --> 1:07:11.840
 in the history of the world have played this game

1:07:11.840 --> 1:07:14.480
 and have struggled with whatever,

1:07:14.480 --> 1:07:17.000
 have projected their struggles onto the chessboard

1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.080
 and thought, and the nations have fought

1:07:19.080 --> 1:07:20.760
 over the chessboard.

1:07:20.760 --> 1:07:22.520
 The Soviet Union versus the United States,

1:07:22.520 --> 1:07:24.520
 Bobby Fischer represented the United States.

1:07:24.520 --> 1:07:26.360
 Spassky represented the Soviet Union.

1:07:26.360 --> 1:07:27.880
 Yeah.

1:07:27.880 --> 1:07:30.520
 I gotta, before I lose track of it,

1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:32.440
 when we were talking about The Godfather,

1:07:32.440 --> 1:07:35.960
 you were in American Gangster, great film.

1:07:35.960 --> 1:07:37.440
 You said it's one of your favorites too.

1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:41.880
 What, you were in it with Denzel Washington.

1:07:41.880 --> 1:07:44.200
 What makes that movie meaningful to you?

1:07:44.200 --> 1:07:47.200
 What was it like making that movie?

1:07:47.200 --> 1:07:49.360
 Because it's a great, great American film.

1:07:49.360 --> 1:07:50.680
 That was a great American film.

1:07:50.680 --> 1:07:52.360
 It was so many things in that film.

1:07:52.360 --> 1:07:55.560
 Being a part of that film was probably a blessing

1:07:55.560 --> 1:07:59.360
 and a treasure, because even if I wasn't a part of it,

1:08:00.320 --> 1:08:02.800
 it just caught such great filmmaking

1:08:02.800 --> 1:08:07.800
 and to me, a really cool, great story.

1:08:07.920 --> 1:08:11.240
 The thing that I love about it the most

1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:15.760
 really is the process of it.

1:08:18.520 --> 1:08:19.360
 Which part of the process?

1:08:19.360 --> 1:08:22.560
 I wouldn't have known the process if I wasn't part of it.

1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:25.040
 So as a film joy, it was a great film,

1:08:25.040 --> 1:08:27.960
 but even the process of making it

1:08:27.960 --> 1:08:32.560
 was like high level education for me on multiple levels.

1:08:32.560 --> 1:08:36.320
 I'm working with Ridley Scott, which is,

1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:38.600
 and this is a bold statement if I say this here,

1:08:38.600 --> 1:08:41.640
 cause I got a lot of friends that's going to probably,

1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:44.280
 but he's probably the best living director.

1:08:46.800 --> 1:08:51.320
 Because watching him allowed me to understand

1:08:51.320 --> 1:08:54.160
 a principle that I've coined to him

1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:57.560
 and I don't know if people use it yet, called multi vision.

1:08:57.560 --> 1:09:02.560
 He seems to have the capacity to see eight things

1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:09.480
 at one time.

1:09:09.480 --> 1:09:11.800
 I heard on Robin Hood, he had 18 cameras.

1:09:11.800 --> 1:09:13.320
 I wasn't there for that.

1:09:13.320 --> 1:09:15.600
 And you think he keeps them all in his mind, just seeing.

1:09:15.600 --> 1:09:19.200
 I seen him do it when he went to the monitors

1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:22.320
 with the video playback guy.

1:09:22.320 --> 1:09:26.480
 I seen him bring everything back to a point,

1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:30.080
 but nothing was the same on the frame.

1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:32.280
 He was already there.

1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:36.360
 And he knew if he had what he was or not.

1:09:36.360 --> 1:09:39.840
 And he placed the cameras there.

1:09:39.840 --> 1:09:43.200
 And he saw it in his own way.

1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:46.480
 And I peeped it.

1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:47.640
 I peeped it.

1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:48.800
 And I said, yeah.

1:09:48.800 --> 1:09:50.680
 And I just humbly asked him.

1:09:50.680 --> 1:09:56.000
 He was gracious enough to speak to me and talk to me.

1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:59.480
 And confirm what I thought I saw.

1:09:59.480 --> 1:10:00.280
 He confirmed it.

1:10:00.280 --> 1:10:01.000
 He confirmed it.

1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:05.280
 And I was able to utilize it, as I'm a filmmaker now.

1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:09.120
 And I see, I can at least see three or four things.

1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:10.280
 I can't see eight yet.

1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:12.760
 I'll be there though.

1:10:12.760 --> 1:10:15.920
 But I could definitely, even right now,

1:10:15.920 --> 1:10:21.040
 just I could go like this in the room, OK?

1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:22.320
 I got it now.

1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:25.400
 I got how to make this right here,

1:10:25.400 --> 1:10:27.000
 which is just us all sitting.

1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:28.240
 How do I make this dramatic?

1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:31.280
 Look, boom.

1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:31.920
 Come on on him.

1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:32.880
 There's a story there.

1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:34.000
 There's a story there.

1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:36.320
 And I might just go off his hanging watch

1:10:36.320 --> 1:10:38.040
 or his hanging wristband.

1:10:38.040 --> 1:10:38.840
 Yeah.

1:10:38.840 --> 1:10:40.320
 Because there's something else there too.

1:10:40.320 --> 1:10:40.920
 Is he dead?

1:10:40.920 --> 1:10:41.520
 We don't know.

1:10:41.520 --> 1:10:43.240
 Exactly.

1:10:43.240 --> 1:10:45.800
 So he has this.

1:10:45.800 --> 1:10:47.360
 And even though this is the scene.

1:10:47.360 --> 1:10:50.640
 Yeah, you keeping that in mind, all of this in mind.

1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:51.520
 Yeah.

1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:53.840
 What about like, can you give an inkling

1:10:53.840 --> 1:10:56.640
 of other parts of the process, like the editing?

1:10:56.640 --> 1:10:58.120
 Like where does the magic happen?

1:10:58.120 --> 1:10:58.920
 Another thing.

1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:02.120
 Pedro, I don't pronounce Pedro last name right.

1:11:02.120 --> 1:11:02.920
 He's a cool guy.

1:11:02.920 --> 1:11:04.680
 I had a chance to play rugby with him.

1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:06.160
 He was on, was he on my team?

1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:06.960
 Yeah.

1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:08.320
 We were in both teams.

1:11:08.320 --> 1:11:15.520
 But Pedro, the editor who edited many great films,

1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:24.040
 once again, he has, I will call, deciphering power.

1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:27.520
 A good editor is a decipher, almost like breaking

1:11:27.520 --> 1:11:33.960
 the enigma, because he's dealing with thousands,

1:11:33.960 --> 1:11:36.760
 or we'll call it a film, with millions of feet of film,

1:11:36.760 --> 1:11:38.000
 at least a million feet of film.

1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.600
 That's a lot of film for a feature.

1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:42.920
 He's dealing with that.

1:11:42.920 --> 1:11:47.080
 But he's dealing with multiple cameras.

1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:48.720
 So it ain't like it's like two cameras.

1:11:48.720 --> 1:11:50.840
 He got an A, B, and he could just go back.

1:11:50.840 --> 1:11:51.880
 No.

1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:54.480
 He may have six cameras, and he has to go back

1:11:54.480 --> 1:11:56.160
 and deal with that process.

1:11:56.160 --> 1:11:58.480
 And you know what?

1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:03.120
 He knows how to tell the story again.

1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:06.000
 And he proved it on American Gangster

1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:11.200
 as me being a witness, because it's so much information.

1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:14.280
 Even when the brothers all start getting their little business

1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:16.240
 and then he put one in the Bronx,

1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:21.880
 he just captured every neighborhood within one minute,

1:12:21.880 --> 1:12:23.320
 and you knew what would happen.

1:12:23.320 --> 1:12:24.400
 You knew it all.

1:12:24.400 --> 1:12:26.560
 You saw the whole rise of fame.

1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:29.240
 You watched the Palmer and Scarface,

1:12:29.240 --> 1:12:34.200
 who does it in two minutes, but it's only one character.

1:12:34.200 --> 1:12:35.520
 So you see him go to the bank.

1:12:35.520 --> 1:12:36.560
 He drops the money off.

1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:37.760
 You see him buy the lion.

1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:39.920
 You see him gets his wife, or the tiger.

1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:41.840
 You see him gets his wife, you see all that.

1:12:41.840 --> 1:12:44.840
 And then it ends on the big side of him in a big house

1:12:44.840 --> 1:12:46.680
 with all the TV screens.

1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:49.160
 And you seen him go through it, right?

1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:50.720
 But in American Gangster, you're going

1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:53.360
 to tell that story of rising, but you also got

1:12:53.360 --> 1:12:54.920
 to include these five brothers.

1:12:54.920 --> 1:12:56.360
 Yeah.

1:12:56.360 --> 1:12:57.880
 And that's all in the edit.

1:12:57.880 --> 1:12:58.680
 Oh, man.

1:12:58.680 --> 1:13:02.560
 But also all in the director knowing that as well.

1:13:02.560 --> 1:13:05.200
 And you got to keep thinking about them, because that

1:13:05.200 --> 1:13:06.520
 was a story right there.

1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:07.320
 Yeah.

1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:08.840
 While I was hearing it, I don't know

1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:10.200
 if they was taking pictures of him,

1:13:10.200 --> 1:13:12.920
 or they might have a little party over there.

1:13:12.920 --> 1:13:13.720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:15.360
 Chess, I think.

1:13:15.360 --> 1:13:16.760
 Yeah, I like it.

1:13:16.760 --> 1:13:19.720
 They're playing chess in the distance.

1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:22.720
 This is great.

1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:26.000
 You said that you were always an old soul

1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:28.240
 and see the world as if you're 200 years old.

1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:29.480
 I like this line.

1:13:29.480 --> 1:13:31.200
 Because your creative vision allows

1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:33.800
 you to see the final piece you've created,

1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:38.400
 or you're creating very quickly, quicker than others.

1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:42.280
 I heard that as if you've almost lived many lives.

1:13:42.280 --> 1:13:45.560
 You have this experience that allows you to see the vision.

1:13:45.560 --> 1:13:47.880
 So let me ask you on creativity, where

1:13:47.880 --> 1:13:51.080
 does this creativity behind RZA come from,

1:13:51.080 --> 1:13:54.600
 both musically and film wise?

1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:57.520
 I don't know if I have the answer to that one, right?

1:13:57.520 --> 1:14:00.040
 Seriously, where does it come from?

1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:02.080
 Only thing I could say about that

1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:07.840
 is that for some reason, it seems endless.

1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:13.680
 And that's peculiar when I think about it myself,

1:14:13.680 --> 1:14:20.040
 because I was taught a lot of things from the JZA.

1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:22.120
 He introduced me to mathematics.

1:14:22.120 --> 1:14:27.120
 He introduced me to hip hop itself, to break dancing.

1:14:27.120 --> 1:14:31.080
 I got other cousins that introduced me to graffiti,

1:14:31.080 --> 1:14:34.240
 cousins that introduced me to DJing.

1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:37.000
 I realized that I had a lot of introductions,

1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:40.880
 but the JZA definitely, my older cousin,

1:14:40.880 --> 1:14:44.440
 gave me a lot of early inspirations.

1:14:44.440 --> 1:14:50.160
 And not saying that he's not creative,

1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:55.480
 as creative as he was then or now,

1:14:55.480 --> 1:15:00.680
 the wide span of creativity, I don't see him doing that,

1:15:00.680 --> 1:15:02.600
 right?

1:15:02.600 --> 1:15:06.960
 And I don't see the cousins that taught me how to DJ.

1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:13.280
 I didn't see them move from DJing to making the beats.

1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:20.600
 My cousin who actually got me into instruments,

1:15:20.600 --> 1:15:25.040
 I didn't see him leave funk and rock.

1:15:25.040 --> 1:15:27.480
 I'm an orchestra composer now.

1:15:27.480 --> 1:15:35.840
 So I just said to myself, I just accept myself as an artist,

1:15:35.840 --> 1:15:37.000
 as a creative artist.

1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.120
 That's what I am.

1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:40.400
 I have to accept that.

1:15:40.400 --> 1:15:43.120
 Now, where it comes from, I don't know.

1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:45.680
 If I was to try to say where it comes from,

1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:48.520
 like, hey, give me some type of answer,

1:15:48.520 --> 1:15:50.680
 I would say from life itself.

1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:51.640
 But what does it feel like?

1:15:51.640 --> 1:15:53.520
 Because you mentioned during this pandemic,

1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:55.600
 for example, for some reason, more

1:15:55.600 --> 1:15:57.840
 came to you in terms of writing.

1:15:57.840 --> 1:16:00.800
 And so do you feel like you're just receiving signals

1:16:00.800 --> 1:16:05.000
 from elsewhere, or do you feel like it's hard work,

1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.200
 or you're just waiting?

1:16:07.200 --> 1:16:07.920
 Wow.

1:16:07.920 --> 1:16:10.720
 It's not even waiting, nor is it hard work.

1:16:10.720 --> 1:16:13.600
 It's almost like I said in one of my other lyrics,

1:16:13.600 --> 1:16:15.560
 this is for the MC part of it.

1:16:15.560 --> 1:16:19.720
 I said, MCing to me is easy as breathing.

1:16:19.720 --> 1:16:20.920
 So it's like breathing.

1:16:20.920 --> 1:16:23.960
 Yeah, it's just like, in fact, there's

1:16:23.960 --> 1:16:26.400
 actually was a scientific thing I read about that.

1:16:26.400 --> 1:16:28.000
 Now that you've said that.

1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:28.560
 You heard this?

1:16:28.560 --> 1:16:30.080
 I know you've had to hear this.

1:16:30.080 --> 1:16:37.400
 They say that the atoms in our atmosphere, which

1:16:37.400 --> 1:16:41.760
 seem to be infinite in number, are not infinite

1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:44.560
 in the space they occupy.

1:16:44.560 --> 1:16:48.200
 Because they're in our atmosphere.

1:16:48.200 --> 1:16:52.720
 And so there's a chance that at least 1 million atoms

1:16:52.720 --> 1:16:58.240
 that you breathe in your life was breathed by Galileo.

1:16:58.240 --> 1:16:59.480
 You heard this before, right?

1:16:59.480 --> 1:17:00.320
 Yeah.

1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:02.840
 OK.

1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:04.120
 It's very accurate.

1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:05.120
 OK.

1:17:05.120 --> 1:17:07.240
 How does your body digest it?

1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:15.640
 Oh, let's start at the fact that most of the atoms that we're

1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:18.440
 made of is from stars, right?

1:17:18.440 --> 1:17:19.080
 Stars burst.

1:17:19.080 --> 1:17:22.640
 So we're all really connected fundamentally somehow.

1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:25.960
 And then the atoms that make up our body come and leave.

1:17:25.960 --> 1:17:28.080
 And the same with the cells that are in our body,

1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:29.520
 they die and are reborn.

1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:31.520
 And we don't pay attention to any of that.

1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:33.320
 That all just goes through us.

1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:33.960
 I don't know.

1:17:37.400 --> 1:17:41.960
 That makes me feel like I'm not an individual.

1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:45.600
 I'm just a finger of something much bigger,

1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:47.560
 some much bigger organism.

1:17:47.560 --> 1:17:51.760
 Well, because you're drinking the coffee there, right?

1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:54.240
 You're going to digest that.

1:17:54.240 --> 1:17:56.880
 You're going to digest those atoms,

1:17:56.880 --> 1:17:58.880
 whether you're going to put them through the bowel

1:17:58.880 --> 1:18:00.680
 or through the urination, it's coming out.

1:18:00.680 --> 1:18:01.800
 Or maybe you'll sweat it out.

1:18:01.800 --> 1:18:02.280
 Yeah.

1:18:02.280 --> 1:18:03.360
 You might sneeze it out.

1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:04.040
 Yeah.

1:18:04.040 --> 1:18:05.640
 But they're going to make their way out.

1:18:05.640 --> 1:18:10.040
 How do you digest the atoms if you just breathe in Galileo?

1:18:10.040 --> 1:18:11.400
 Right?

1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:14.560
 And that's what I think an artist does.

1:18:14.560 --> 1:18:16.360
 I think something in the artist, it's

1:18:16.360 --> 1:18:18.560
 like some people eat things and they're going to gain weight.

1:18:18.560 --> 1:18:19.680
 Some people ain't going to gain weight.

1:18:19.680 --> 1:18:22.240
 They're going to gain muscle.

1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:23.640
 I'll just give you an analogy here.

1:18:23.640 --> 1:18:28.800
 I'm thinking that the artist breathes in and translates it

1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:29.680
 into the art.

1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:30.800
 First, they got to hear it.

1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:33.960
 I think most of us don't hear that.

1:18:33.960 --> 1:18:35.760
 We receive it, but it just doesn't come out.

1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:37.640
 Yeah, we not have the frequency.

1:18:37.640 --> 1:18:40.440
 I said this to a lot of artists.

1:18:40.440 --> 1:18:42.800
 And even we all can consider ourselves artists

1:18:42.800 --> 1:18:44.960
 in a certain way.

1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:50.240
 But let's just say there's only one million artists

1:18:50.240 --> 1:18:51.920
 in the world.

1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:53.920
 Good.

1:18:53.920 --> 1:18:57.520
 Because it's probably 10.

1:18:57.520 --> 1:19:01.400
 If you divide that into the population,

1:19:01.400 --> 1:19:03.200
 what part of the table would it be?

1:19:03.200 --> 1:19:04.160
 The tiny part.

1:19:04.160 --> 1:19:07.760
 It might be that, right?

1:19:07.760 --> 1:19:11.880
 And yet, it's that that inspires that.

1:19:11.880 --> 1:19:13.960
 And you know what's so crazy about that, though?

1:19:13.960 --> 1:19:15.320
 There's also a chance.

1:19:15.320 --> 1:19:18.120
 I'm just going numbers and I'm just hypothesizing with you.

1:19:18.120 --> 1:19:22.440
 But there's also a chance that all of this

1:19:22.440 --> 1:19:24.240
 is actually informing that.

1:19:24.240 --> 1:19:26.680
 Yeah.

1:19:26.680 --> 1:19:29.760
 The artist is just watching this, all of this,

1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:32.040
 all the chaos of this.

1:19:32.040 --> 1:19:34.600
 Yeah, so it's hard to know where the beauty comes from.

1:19:34.600 --> 1:19:36.680
 Is it the artist or the chaos from the?

1:19:36.680 --> 1:19:39.240
 So I just say I don't have the answer.

1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:41.960
 But if I was to be forced to say an answer,

1:19:41.960 --> 1:19:44.200
 and you're not twisting my arm, but I'll say.

1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:45.240
 I can if you want me to.

1:19:45.240 --> 1:19:46.080
 No, thank you.

1:19:46.080 --> 1:19:48.280
 I'll say life.

1:19:48.280 --> 1:19:51.480
 Yeah, life.

1:19:51.480 --> 1:19:54.920
 In Tao of Wu, you write something about confusion,

1:19:54.920 --> 1:19:56.120
 which I really like.

1:19:56.120 --> 1:19:58.640
 Confusion is a gift from God.

1:19:58.640 --> 1:20:01.800
 Those times when you feel most desperate for a solution,

1:20:01.800 --> 1:20:03.840
 sit, wait.

1:20:03.840 --> 1:20:06.040
 The information will become clear.

1:20:06.040 --> 1:20:08.680
 The confusion is there to guide you.

1:20:08.680 --> 1:20:12.480
 Seek detachment and become the producer of your life.

1:20:12.480 --> 1:20:15.560
 So I got to ask you advice.

1:20:15.560 --> 1:20:20.000
 If a young person today in high school, college

1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:22.000
 is looking for some advice, what advice

1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:24.880
 could you give them to be a producer of a life

1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:26.080
 that can be proud of?

1:20:26.080 --> 1:20:29.320
 Read the Tao of Wu.

1:20:29.320 --> 1:20:31.320
 Let's start with the Wu Tang manual first.

1:20:31.320 --> 1:20:32.120
 Yeah.

1:20:32.120 --> 1:20:33.280
 No, you could do that second.

1:20:33.280 --> 1:20:34.080
 Second?

1:20:34.080 --> 1:20:34.880
 Yeah.

1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:36.400
 I think you could read the Tao of Wu first

1:20:36.400 --> 1:20:37.800
 and then do the manual.

1:20:37.800 --> 1:20:41.600
 Because the manual is not to put the two books against each

1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:43.800
 other, but the manual is talking about things

1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:47.280
 that is so deeply connected to the music.

1:20:47.280 --> 1:20:51.200
 And the people in the Tao of Wu goes beyond that.

1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:56.640
 So I would actually start there, which is not normally

1:20:56.640 --> 1:20:57.600
 what I would prescribe.

1:20:57.600 --> 1:21:00.360
 I always tell people, start in knowledge, then go to wisdom.

1:21:00.360 --> 1:21:01.200
 But since the Tao of Wu.

1:21:01.200 --> 1:21:02.240
 Skip ahead to the wisdom.

1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:03.040
 I like it.

1:21:03.040 --> 1:21:06.120
 Yeah, I think for a young man in high school,

1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:08.960
 go to the Tao of Wu and then go back.

1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:13.520
 It's just like sometimes you have my son's generation,

1:21:13.520 --> 1:21:17.000
 they have to watch the second round of Star Wars.

1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:17.800
 Yeah.

1:21:17.800 --> 1:21:19.160
 And then they go back.

1:21:19.160 --> 1:21:19.960
 You know what I mean?

1:21:19.960 --> 1:21:22.600
 This generation is watching The Force Awakens.

1:21:22.600 --> 1:21:23.400
 And then they go back.

1:21:23.400 --> 1:21:24.200
 Yeah.

1:21:24.200 --> 1:21:29.760
 But what, because if you just look at your life as an example,

1:21:29.760 --> 1:21:31.840
 that's one heck of a life.

1:21:31.840 --> 1:21:33.720
 There's very few lives like it.

1:21:33.720 --> 1:21:36.160
 You've created some of the most incredible things

1:21:36.160 --> 1:21:38.240
 artistically in this world.

1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:43.000
 Like if somebody, you talk about that like 1 million, right?

1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:44.680
 At the corner of the table.

1:21:44.680 --> 1:21:49.040
 If somebody wants, strives, dreams to become one of those,

1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:50.480
 how do they do it?

1:21:50.480 --> 1:21:53.560
 Well, the beautiful thing is that there

1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:58.200
 are footprints left by those who've done it.

1:21:58.200 --> 1:22:02.400
 And the best way is to study that.

1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:05.000
 To study those who've already done what you want to do.

1:22:09.120 --> 1:22:10.480
 We live on a civilization.

1:22:10.480 --> 1:22:13.280
 As we said, this is the greatest country in the world.

1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:17.160
 But our seal is a pyramid with an I on it.

1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:17.960
 You know what I mean?

1:22:17.960 --> 1:22:19.640
 Because they did it before.

1:22:19.640 --> 1:22:22.400
 And they may have failed for some reason

1:22:22.400 --> 1:22:24.200
 or something happens.

1:22:24.200 --> 1:22:29.000
 But it was just a strong enough example to take us further.

1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:31.840
 Elon Musk is sitting here trying to do better than what

1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:33.800
 the rocket builders did before.

1:22:33.800 --> 1:22:36.200
 He's not the first one to build the rocket.

1:22:36.200 --> 1:22:39.000
 He's not the first guy to think of with the electric car.

1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:40.320
 He's doing it better.

1:22:40.320 --> 1:22:43.760
 He's advancing it to the point that whoever

1:22:43.760 --> 1:22:45.560
 picks up after him, maybe they'll

1:22:45.560 --> 1:22:47.640
 get to that flying car.

1:22:47.640 --> 1:22:51.280
 So that's the beauty.

1:22:51.280 --> 1:22:52.440
 There's a good verse.

1:22:52.440 --> 1:22:55.360
 I love finding verses to say things to confirm.

1:22:55.360 --> 1:22:59.440
 Because this way, people could take it verbally, physically,

1:22:59.440 --> 1:23:01.160
 and then maybe even spiritually.

1:23:01.160 --> 1:23:02.560
 But Christmas has said a verse.

1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:05.920
 He said, the fastest way to heaven

1:23:05.920 --> 1:23:08.520
 is by spending time or studying the wise people.

1:23:08.520 --> 1:23:10.360
 Meaning the wise people who are living

1:23:10.360 --> 1:23:13.080
 and those who live before you.

1:23:13.080 --> 1:23:14.760
 Study the masters.

1:23:14.760 --> 1:23:17.280
 Let me ask you a big, perhaps ridiculous question,

1:23:17.280 --> 1:23:18.680
 but give it a shot.

1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:20.240
 What is the meaning of this whole thing?

1:23:20.240 --> 1:23:23.240
 What's the meaning of life?

1:23:23.240 --> 1:23:24.280
 Big question.

1:23:24.280 --> 1:23:25.720
 I'm not going to rush into the answer.

1:23:30.880 --> 1:23:33.120
 I'm going to give you somebody else's answer first,

1:23:33.120 --> 1:23:34.920
 and I'll give you my answer.

1:23:34.920 --> 1:23:42.000
 I remember asking this when I was 15, 16 years old.

1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:45.960
 One of the brothers was studying in mathematics.

1:23:45.960 --> 1:23:55.240
 And the letter I itself means I Islam.

1:23:55.240 --> 1:24:02.920
 I meaning the individual being in total accord with Islam.

1:24:02.920 --> 1:24:03.960
 And let me finish this.

1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:05.800
 Then they took the word Islam, and they

1:24:05.800 --> 1:24:13.240
 defined it as Islam is an Arabic word for peace.

1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:20.120
 Then they said, peace is the absence of confusion.

1:24:20.120 --> 1:24:21.560
 OK?

1:24:21.560 --> 1:24:23.840
 So then they took them.

1:24:23.840 --> 1:24:26.560
 This is something that really hit me when I never forgot it.

1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:28.680
 And I'm going to decipher it.

1:24:28.680 --> 1:24:31.160
 But then they took the word Islam,

1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:34.920
 and they broke it down by the letter into an acronym,

1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:37.200
 like cash, with everything around me.

1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:45.840
 And they broke it down to I stimulate light and matter.

1:24:45.840 --> 1:24:48.600
 And I was like, what?

1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:52.280
 Because what hit me is that if you're not here,

1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:55.120
 then light and matter don't exist to you.

1:24:55.120 --> 1:24:59.160
 So you're stimulating it, or it ain't here for you.

1:24:59.160 --> 1:25:00.280
 So anyway, taking all that.

1:25:00.280 --> 1:25:03.840
 But then I said, so what's the meaning of life?

1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:06.760
 And the brothers just said, love Islam forever.

1:25:06.760 --> 1:25:07.560
 Right?

1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:08.360
 Yeah.

1:25:08.360 --> 1:25:12.840
 And I said, I ain't saying the religious point of it.

1:25:12.840 --> 1:25:14.400
 I'm just saying all those other elements

1:25:14.400 --> 1:25:15.800
 I just spoke about in front of it.

1:25:15.800 --> 1:25:17.880
 I stimulate light and matter.

1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:18.560
 I love that.

1:25:18.560 --> 1:25:20.840
 That's powerful.

1:25:20.840 --> 1:25:24.960
 And let me give you my definition of life.

1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:30.520
 I think life is simply for each and every one of us

1:25:30.520 --> 1:25:33.440
 to add on to.

1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:34.120
 Build.

1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:36.320
 Like you said, the masters.

1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:37.360
 Build on top.

1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:38.520
 Life gave you life.

1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:41.600
 Give life back.

1:25:41.600 --> 1:25:43.720
 I don't think there's a better way to end it than talking

1:25:43.720 --> 1:25:44.800
 about the meaning of life.

1:25:44.800 --> 1:25:46.640
 RZA, I'm a huge fan.

1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:48.800
 It's such a huge honor that you spend your valuable time

1:25:48.800 --> 1:25:49.320
 with me.

1:25:49.320 --> 1:25:50.120
 Thank you so much.

1:25:50.120 --> 1:25:50.920
 Thank you for inviting me.

1:25:50.920 --> 1:25:52.400
 Peace.

1:25:52.400 --> 1:25:55.240
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with RZA.

1:25:55.240 --> 1:25:58.000

1:25:58.000 --> 1:25:59.440

1:25:59.440 --> 1:26:03.160
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Plato.

1:26:03.160 --> 1:26:08.240
 Poetry is nearer to vital truth than history.

1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:23.320
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
