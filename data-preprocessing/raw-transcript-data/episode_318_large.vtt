00:00.000 --> 00:01.720
 Well, the source of energy at the origin of life

00:01.720 --> 00:04.720
 is the reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

00:04.720 --> 00:08.320
 And amazingly, most of these reactions are exergonic,

00:08.320 --> 00:10.760
 which is to say they release energy.

00:10.760 --> 00:13.280
 If you have hydrogen and CO2,

00:13.280 --> 00:15.240
 and you put them together in a falcon tube

00:15.240 --> 00:17.320
 and you warm it up to say 50 degrees centigrade,

00:17.320 --> 00:19.980
 and you put in a couple of catalysts and you shake it,

00:19.980 --> 00:21.320
 nothing's gonna happen.

00:21.320 --> 00:24.780
 But thermodynamically, that is less stable.

00:24.780 --> 00:28.240
 Two gases, hydrogen and CO2, is less stable than cells.

00:28.240 --> 00:31.240
 What should happen is you get cells coming out.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.400
 Why doesn't that happen?

00:32.400 --> 00:34.760
 It's because of the kinetic barriers.

00:34.760 --> 00:36.360
 That's where you need the spark.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.680
 The following is a conversation with Nick Lane,

00:40.680 --> 00:43.400
 a biochemist at University College London

00:43.400 --> 00:46.200
 and author of some of my favorite books

00:46.200 --> 00:49.640
 on biology, science, and life ever written,

00:49.640 --> 00:51.440
 including his two most recent titled

00:51.440 --> 00:54.520
 "'Transformer,' The Deep Chemistry of Life and Death,"

00:54.520 --> 00:59.440
 and the vital question, why is life the way it is?

01:00.280 --> 01:02.340
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:02.340 --> 01:04.460
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:04.460 --> 01:05.760
 in the description.

01:05.760 --> 01:09.020
 And now, dear friends, here's Nick Lane.

01:09.880 --> 01:11.820
 Let's start with perhaps the most mysterious,

01:11.820 --> 01:16.620
 the most interesting question that we little humans

01:16.620 --> 01:18.140
 can ask of ourselves.

01:18.140 --> 01:20.640
 How did life originate on Earth?

01:20.640 --> 01:24.020
 You could ask anybody working on the subject,

01:24.020 --> 01:26.920
 and you'll get a different answer from all of them.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.620
 They will be pretty passionately held opinions,

01:30.620 --> 01:32.620
 and their opinions grounded in science,

01:34.060 --> 01:36.160
 but they're still really, at this point, their opinions,

01:36.160 --> 01:37.920
 because there's so much stuff to know

01:38.880 --> 01:42.860
 that all we can ever do is get a small slice of it,

01:42.860 --> 01:44.940
 and it's the context which matters.

01:44.940 --> 01:46.600
 So I can give you my answer.

01:46.600 --> 01:50.680
 My answer is from a biologist's point of view.

01:50.680 --> 01:54.780
 That has been missing from the equation over decades,

01:54.780 --> 01:57.520
 which is, well, what does life do on Earth?

01:57.520 --> 01:58.640
 Why is it this way?

01:58.640 --> 01:59.720
 Why is it made of cells?

01:59.720 --> 02:01.320
 Why is it made of carbon?

02:01.320 --> 02:06.020
 Why is it powered by electrical charges on membranes?

02:06.020 --> 02:09.040
 There's all these interesting questions about cells

02:09.040 --> 02:10.200
 that if you then look to see,

02:10.200 --> 02:12.020
 well, is there an environment on Earth,

02:12.020 --> 02:14.240
 on the early Earth four billion years ago,

02:14.240 --> 02:16.720
 that kind of matches the requirements of cells?

02:16.720 --> 02:17.560
 Well, there is one.

02:17.560 --> 02:18.480
 There's a very obvious one.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.040
 It's basically created by whenever you have

02:21.040 --> 02:24.720
 a wet, rocky planet, you get these hydrothermal vents,

02:24.720 --> 02:28.620
 which generate hydrogen gas in bucket loads,

02:28.620 --> 02:32.480
 and electrical charges on kind of cell like pores

02:32.480 --> 02:35.560
 that can drive the kind of chemistry that life does.

02:35.560 --> 02:39.520
 So it seems so beautiful and so obvious

02:40.480 --> 02:43.960
 that I've spent the last 10 years or more

02:43.960 --> 02:45.120
 trying to do experiments.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.160
 It turns out to be difficult, of course.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.560
 Everything's more difficult than you ever thought

02:48.560 --> 02:51.220
 it was gonna be, but it looks, I would say,

02:51.220 --> 02:53.920
 more true rather than less true over that 10 year period.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.320
 I think I have to take a step back every now and then

02:56.320 --> 02:59.020
 and think, hang on a minute, where's this going?

02:59.020 --> 03:02.000
 I'm happy it's going in a sensible direction.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.580
 And I think then you have these other interesting dilemmas.

03:06.580 --> 03:10.480
 I mean, I'm often accused of being too focused

03:10.480 --> 03:14.880
 on life on Earth, too kind of narrow minded

03:14.880 --> 03:17.080
 and inward looking, you might say.

03:17.080 --> 03:18.880
 I'm talking about carbon, I'm talking about cells,

03:18.880 --> 03:21.600
 and maybe you or plenty of people can say to me,

03:21.600 --> 03:23.220
 ah, yeah, but life can be anything.

03:23.220 --> 03:24.800
 I have no imagination.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.120
 And maybe they're right.

03:26.120 --> 03:29.720
 But unless we can say why life here is this way,

03:29.720 --> 03:32.000
 and if those reasons are fundamental reasons,

03:32.000 --> 03:33.940
 or if they're just trivial reasons,

03:33.940 --> 03:36.160
 then we can't answer that question.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.760
 So I think they're fundamental reasons,

03:38.760 --> 03:40.340
 and I think we need to worry about them.

03:40.340 --> 03:42.480
 Yeah, there might be some deep truth to the puzzle

03:42.480 --> 03:44.480
 here on Earth that will resonate

03:44.480 --> 03:47.400
 with other puzzles elsewhere that will,

03:48.520 --> 03:50.320
 solving this particular puzzle

03:50.320 --> 03:52.020
 will give us that deeper truth.

03:52.020 --> 03:57.020
 So what, to this puzzle, you said vents, hydrogen,

03:58.600 --> 04:03.600
 wet, so chemically, what is the potion here?

04:04.440 --> 04:06.020
 How important is oxygen?

04:06.020 --> 04:07.160
 You wrote a book about this.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.300
 Yeah, and I actually just came straight here

04:09.300 --> 04:11.080
 from a conference where I was chairing a session

04:11.080 --> 04:13.880
 on whether oxygen matters or not in the history of life.

04:13.880 --> 04:16.480
 Of course it matters, but it matters most

04:16.480 --> 04:18.440
 to the origin of life to be not there.

04:20.140 --> 04:23.000
 As I see it, we have this, I mean,

04:23.000 --> 04:27.040
 life is made of carbon, basically, primarily,

04:27.040 --> 04:30.280
 organic molecules with carbon, carbon bonds.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.880
 And the building block, the Lego brick

04:32.880 --> 04:34.920
 that we take out of the air or take out of the oceans

04:34.920 --> 04:36.500
 is carbon dioxide.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.620
 And to turn carbon dioxide into organic molecules,

04:39.620 --> 04:42.000
 we need to strap on hydrogen.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.760
 And so we need, and this is basically

04:43.760 --> 04:47.480
 what life is doing, it's hydrogenating carbon dioxide.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.480
 It's taking the hydrogen, the bubbles out of the earth

04:49.480 --> 04:53.000
 in these hydrothermal vents, and it sticks it on CO2.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.300
 And it's kind of really as simple as that.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.200
 And actually, thermodynamically,

04:58.200 --> 05:01.040
 there's the thing that I find most troubling

05:01.040 --> 05:03.840
 is that if you do these experiments in the lab,

05:03.840 --> 05:06.040
 the molecules you get are exactly the molecules

05:06.040 --> 05:07.920
 that we see at the heart of biochemistry

05:07.920 --> 05:08.920
 in the heart of life.

05:08.920 --> 05:13.920
 Is there something to be said about the earliest origins

05:14.080 --> 05:19.080
 of that little potion, that chemical process?

05:21.440 --> 05:23.620
 What really is the spark there?

05:24.600 --> 05:27.320
 There isn't a spark.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.640
 There is a continuous chemical reaction.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.120
 And there is kind of a spark,

05:33.120 --> 05:35.080
 but it's a continuous electrical charge

05:35.080 --> 05:37.440
 which helps drive that reaction.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.040
 There's a literally spark.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.560
 Well, the charge at least, but yes.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.960
 I mean, a spark in that sense is,

05:43.960 --> 05:46.440
 we tend to think of in terms of Frankenstein,

05:46.440 --> 05:48.440
 we tend to think in terms of electricity

05:48.440 --> 05:52.080
 and one moment you zap something and it comes alive.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.560
 And what does that really mean?

05:53.560 --> 05:56.060
 It's come alive and now what's sustaining it?

05:56.060 --> 05:59.360
 Well, we are sustained by oxygen,

05:59.360 --> 06:02.140
 by this continuous chemical reaction.

06:02.140 --> 06:03.980
 And if you put a plastic bag on your head,

06:03.980 --> 06:07.080
 then you've got a minute or something before it's all over.

06:07.080 --> 06:11.000
 So some way of being able to leverage a source of energy.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.720
 Well, the source of energy at the origin of life

06:12.720 --> 06:15.720
 is the reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

06:15.720 --> 06:19.320
 And amazingly, most of these reactions are exergonic,

06:19.320 --> 06:21.760
 which is to say they release energy.

06:21.760 --> 06:24.280
 If you have hydrogen and CO2

06:24.280 --> 06:26.240
 and you put them together in a falcon tube

06:26.240 --> 06:28.320
 and you warm it up to say 50 degrees centigrade

06:28.320 --> 06:31.000
 and you put in a couple of catalysts and you shake it,

06:31.000 --> 06:32.320
 nothing's gonna happen.

06:32.320 --> 06:35.800
 But thermodynamically, that is less stable.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.240
 Two gases, hydrogen and CO2, is less stable than cells.

06:39.240 --> 06:42.080
 What should happen is you get cells coming out.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.480
 So why doesn't that happen?

06:45.480 --> 06:47.800
 It's because of the kinetic barriers.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.960
 That's where you need the spark.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.040
 Is it possible that life originated

06:52.040 --> 06:54.080
 multiple times on Earth?

06:54.080 --> 06:57.600
 The way you describe it, you make it sound so easy.

06:57.600 --> 07:01.240
 There's a long distance to go from the first bits

07:01.240 --> 07:04.160
 of prebiotic chemistry to, say, molecular machines

07:04.160 --> 07:05.360
 like ribosomes.

07:05.360 --> 07:09.440
 Is that the first thing that you would say is life?

07:09.440 --> 07:12.640
 Like if I introduce you, the two of you at a party,

07:12.640 --> 07:15.040
 you would say that's a living thing?

07:15.040 --> 07:19.920
 I would say as soon as we introduce genes, information,

07:19.920 --> 07:22.040
 into systems that are growing anyway,

07:22.040 --> 07:25.240
 so I would talk about growing protocells,

07:25.240 --> 07:30.080
 as soon as we introduce even random bits of information

07:30.080 --> 07:35.040
 into there, I'm thinking about RNA molecules, for example,

07:35.040 --> 07:36.400
 doesn't have to have any information in it.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.200
 It can be a completely random sequence.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.120
 But if it's introduced into a system which is in any case

07:41.120 --> 07:43.600
 growing and doubling itself and reproducing itself,

07:43.600 --> 07:46.320
 then any changes in that sequence that allow it

07:46.320 --> 07:48.880
 to do so better or worse are now selected

07:48.880 --> 07:51.200
 by perfectly normal natural selection.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.280
 But it's a system.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.560
 So that's when it becomes alive to my mind.

07:54.560 --> 07:59.320
 That's encompassed into like an object

08:00.240 --> 08:03.960
 that keeps information and evolves that information

08:03.960 --> 08:06.440
 over time or changes that information over time

08:06.440 --> 08:07.280
 in response to the.

08:07.280 --> 08:10.000
 So it's always part of a cell system

08:10.000 --> 08:11.160
 from the very beginning.

08:11.160 --> 08:14.320
 So is your sense that it started only once

08:14.320 --> 08:16.800
 because it's difficult or is it possibly started

08:16.800 --> 08:18.680
 in multiple locations on Earth?

08:18.680 --> 08:20.880
 It's possible it started multiple occasions.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.680
 There's two provisos to that.

08:23.680 --> 08:28.680
 One of them is oxygen makes it impossible really

08:28.840 --> 08:29.840
 for life to start.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.840
 So as soon as we've got oxygen in the atmosphere,

08:31.840 --> 08:34.280
 then life isn't gonna keep starting over.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.360
 So I often get asked by people,

08:36.360 --> 08:37.960
 why can't we have life starting?

08:37.960 --> 08:40.600
 If it's so easy, why can't life start in these vents now?

08:40.600 --> 08:43.720
 And the answer is if you want hydrogen to react with CO2

08:43.720 --> 08:45.240
 and there's oxygen there, hydrogen reacts

08:45.240 --> 08:46.120
 with oxygen instead.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.800
 It's just, you get an explosive reaction that way.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.040
 It's rocket fuel.

08:50.040 --> 08:51.240
 So it's never gonna happen.

08:51.240 --> 08:54.120
 But for the origin of life earlier than that,

08:54.120 --> 08:57.280
 all we know is that there's a single common ancestor

08:57.280 --> 08:58.120
 for all of life.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.120
 There could have been multiple origins

09:00.120 --> 09:02.000
 and they all just disappeared.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.160
 But there's a very interesting deep split in life

09:06.160 --> 09:09.000
 between bacteria and what are called archaea,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.280
 which look just the same as bacteria.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.880
 And they're not quite as diverse, but nearly.

09:14.880 --> 09:18.120
 And they are very different in their biochemistry.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.800
 And so any explanation for the origin of life

09:19.800 --> 09:22.840
 has to account as well for why they're so different

09:22.840 --> 09:24.160
 and yet so similar.

09:24.160 --> 09:27.240
 And that makes me think that life probably

09:27.240 --> 09:29.160
 did arise only once.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.960
 Can you describe the difference that's interesting there?

09:31.960 --> 09:34.000
 Well, how they're similar, how they're different?

09:34.000 --> 09:38.120
 Well, they're different in their membranes primarily.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.360
 They're different in things like DNA replication.

09:40.360 --> 09:41.840
 They use completely different enzymes

09:41.840 --> 09:44.640
 and the genes behind it for replicating DNA.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.960
 So they both have membranes, both have DNA replication.

09:47.960 --> 09:48.800
 Yes.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.240
 The process of that is different.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.040
 They both have DNA.

09:52.040 --> 09:54.840
 The genetic code is identical in them both.

09:54.840 --> 09:58.560
 The way in which it's transcribed into RNA,

09:58.560 --> 10:00.960
 into the copy of a gene,

10:00.960 --> 10:03.280
 and the way that that's then translated into a protein,

10:03.280 --> 10:05.320
 that's all basically the same in both of these groups.

10:05.320 --> 10:08.560
 So they clearly share a common ancestor.

10:08.560 --> 10:09.640
 It's just that they're different

10:09.640 --> 10:10.960
 in fundamental ways as well.

10:10.960 --> 10:11.800
 And if you think about, well,

10:11.800 --> 10:15.440
 what kind of processes could drive that divergence

10:15.440 --> 10:16.520
 very early on?

10:18.040 --> 10:19.760
 I can think about it in terms of membranes,

10:19.760 --> 10:22.640
 in terms of the electrical charges on membranes.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.800
 And it's that that makes me think that there was probably,

10:25.800 --> 10:27.480
 there were probably many unsuccessful attempts

10:27.480 --> 10:30.080
 but only one really successful attempt.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.920
 Can you explain why that divergence

10:31.920 --> 10:36.240
 makes you think there's one common ancestor?

10:36.240 --> 10:38.040
 Okay, can you describe that intuition?

10:38.040 --> 10:40.440
 I'm a little bit unclear about why the divert,

10:40.440 --> 10:43.840
 like the leap from the divergence means there's one.

10:43.840 --> 10:47.040
 Do you mean like the divergence indicates

10:47.040 --> 10:52.040
 that there was a big invention at that time from one source?

10:52.280 --> 10:54.720
 If you'd got, as I imagine it,

10:54.720 --> 10:59.160
 you have a common ancestor living in a hydrothermal vent.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.480
 Let's say there are millions of vents

11:01.480 --> 11:04.160
 and millions of potential common ancestors

11:04.160 --> 11:06.080
 living in all of those vents,

11:06.080 --> 11:09.520
 but only one of them makes it out first.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.200
 Then you could imagine that that cell

11:11.200 --> 11:12.720
 is then gonna kind of take over the world

11:12.720 --> 11:14.480
 and wipe out everything else.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.600
 And so what you would see would be

11:16.600 --> 11:18.960
 a single common ancestor for all of life.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.520
 But with lots of different vent systems

11:21.520 --> 11:24.720
 all kind of vying to create the first life forms,

11:24.720 --> 11:25.560
 you might say.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.920
 So this thing is a cell, a single cell organism.

11:28.920 --> 11:32.000
 We're always talking about populations of cells, but yes.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.760
 These are single celled organisms.

11:33.760 --> 11:37.800
 But the fundamental life form is a single cell, right?

11:37.800 --> 11:41.960
 So like, or, so they're always together

11:41.960 --> 11:44.000
 but they're alone together.

11:44.000 --> 11:44.840
 Yeah.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.800
 There's a machinery in each one individual component

11:47.800 --> 11:50.800
 that if left by itself would still work, right?

11:50.800 --> 11:51.680
 Yes, yes, yes.

11:51.680 --> 11:54.560
 It's the unit of selection is a single cell.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.680
 But selection operates over generations

11:56.680 --> 11:59.520
 and changes over generations in populations of cells.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.280
 So it would be impossible to say that a cell

12:01.280 --> 12:03.400
 is the unit of selection in the sense that

12:04.280 --> 12:06.000
 unless you have a population, you can't evolve,

12:06.000 --> 12:07.360
 you can't change.

12:07.360 --> 12:12.280
 Right, but there was one Chuck Norris,

12:12.280 --> 12:15.360
 it's an American reference cell

12:15.360 --> 12:17.840
 that made it out of the vents, right?

12:17.840 --> 12:19.760
 Or like the first one.

12:19.760 --> 12:22.080
 So imagine then that there's one cell gets out

12:22.080 --> 12:23.640
 and it takes over the world.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.600
 It gets out in the water, it's like floating around.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.200
 We're deep in the ocean somewhere.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.040
 Yeah.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.240
 But actually two cells got out

12:31.240 --> 12:35.480
 and they appear to have got out from the same vent

12:35.480 --> 12:38.720
 because they both share the same code and everything else.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.160
 So unless all the, you know,

12:40.160 --> 12:42.200
 we've got a million different common ancestors

12:42.200 --> 12:44.160
 in all these different vents.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.000
 So either they all have the same code

12:47.000 --> 12:49.360
 and two cells spontaneously merge from different places

12:49.360 --> 12:54.120
 or two different cells, fundamentally different cells

12:54.120 --> 12:55.720
 came from the same place.

12:55.720 --> 12:59.280
 So either way, what are the constraints that say,

12:59.280 --> 13:01.640
 not just one came out or not half a million came out,

13:01.640 --> 13:03.320
 but two came out.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.280
 That's kind of a bit strange.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.520
 So how did they come out?

13:06.520 --> 13:09.760
 Well, they come out because what are you doing inside a vent

13:09.760 --> 13:12.680
 is you're relying on the electrical charges down there

13:12.680 --> 13:15.480
 to power this reaction between hydrogen and CO2

13:15.480 --> 13:16.960
 to make yourself grow.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.200
 And when you leave the vent, you've got to do that yourself.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.280
 You've got to power up your own membrane.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.120
 And so the question is,

13:22.120 --> 13:24.800
 well, how do you power up your own membrane?

13:24.800 --> 13:27.240
 And the answer is, well, you need to pump.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.920
 You need to pump ions to give an electrical charge

13:29.920 --> 13:30.800
 on the membrane.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.160
 So what do the pumps look like?

13:32.160 --> 13:35.320
 Well, the pumps look different in these two groups.

13:35.320 --> 13:37.960
 It's as if they both emerged from a common ancestor.

13:37.960 --> 13:39.400
 As soon as you've got that ancestor,

13:39.400 --> 13:43.800
 things move very quickly and divergently.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.840
 Why does the DNA replication look different?

13:45.840 --> 13:47.280
 Well, it's joined to the membrane.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.280
 The membranes are different.

13:48.280 --> 13:49.680
 The DNA replication is different

13:49.680 --> 13:52.360
 because it's joined to a different kind of membrane.

13:52.360 --> 13:55.600
 So there's interesting, this is detail, you may say,

13:55.600 --> 13:57.080
 but it's also fundamental

13:57.080 --> 13:59.680
 because it's about the two big divergent groups

13:59.680 --> 14:02.960
 of life on Earth that seem to have diverged really early on.

14:02.960 --> 14:06.560
 And it all started from one organism.

14:06.560 --> 14:09.600
 And then that organism just start replicating

14:09.600 --> 14:14.320
 the heck out of itself with some mutation of the DNA.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.480
 So like there's some, there's a competition

14:17.480 --> 14:19.400
 through the process of evolution.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.400
 They're not like trying to beat each other up.

14:21.400 --> 14:24.160
 They're just, they're just trying to live.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.680
 Just replicate us.

14:25.680 --> 14:26.520
 Yeah.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.560
 Well, you know, let's not minimize there.

14:28.560 --> 14:29.400
 Yeah.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.320
 They're just trying to chill.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.240
 They're trying to relax up.

14:32.240 --> 14:35.120
 There's no, but there's no sense of trying to survive.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.440
 They're replicating.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.360
 I mean, there's no sense

14:37.360 --> 14:39.600
 in which they're trying to do anything.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.000
 They're just kind of an outgrowth of the Earth,

14:42.000 --> 14:42.840
 you might say.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.760
 Of course, the aliens would describe us humans

14:44.760 --> 14:45.680
 in that same way.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.280
 They might be right.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.640
 This primitive life.

14:48.640 --> 14:52.440
 It's just ants that are hairless,

14:52.440 --> 14:53.360
 mostly hairless.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.360
 Overgrown ants.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.600
 Overgrown ants.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.800
 Okay.

14:56.800 --> 14:59.360
 What do you think about the idea of panspermia

14:59.360 --> 15:03.400
 that the theory that life did not originate on Earth

15:03.400 --> 15:06.880
 and was planted here from outer space?

15:06.880 --> 15:10.640
 Or pseudopanspermia, which is like the basic ingredients,

15:10.640 --> 15:12.920
 the magic that you mentioned was planted here

15:12.920 --> 15:14.680
 from elsewhere in space?

15:14.680 --> 15:16.360
 I don't find them helpful.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.880
 That's not to say they're wrong.

15:18.800 --> 15:22.320
 So, pseudotranspermia, the idea that the chemicals,

15:22.320 --> 15:23.880
 the amino acids, the nucleotides

15:23.880 --> 15:24.800
 are being delivered from space.

15:24.800 --> 15:25.800
 Well, we know that happens.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.080
 It's unequivocal.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.560
 They're delivered on meteorites, comets, and so on.

15:30.840 --> 15:31.800
 So what do they do next?

15:31.800 --> 15:33.120
 That's, to me, the question.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.120
 Well, what do they do is they stock a soup.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.440
 Presumably, they land in a pond or in an ocean

15:37.440 --> 15:39.000
 or wherever they land.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.120
 And then you end up with a best possible case scenario

15:42.120 --> 15:43.880
 is you end up with a soup of nucleotides

15:43.880 --> 15:44.720
 and amino acids.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.400
 And then you have to say, so now what happens?

15:46.400 --> 15:48.200
 And the answer is, oh, well, they have to go,

15:48.200 --> 15:50.760
 bloop, become alive.

15:50.760 --> 15:51.720
 So how did they do that?

15:51.720 --> 15:54.720
 And you may as well say then a miracle happened.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.080
 I don't believe in soup.

15:57.080 --> 16:00.680
 I think what we have in event is a continuous conversion,

16:00.680 --> 16:02.680
 a continuous growth, a continuous reaction,

16:02.680 --> 16:05.880
 a continuous converting a flow of molecules

16:05.880 --> 16:07.880
 into more of yourself, you might say,

16:07.880 --> 16:08.840
 even if it's a small bit.

16:08.840 --> 16:13.000
 So you've got a kind of continuous self organization

16:13.000 --> 16:14.760
 and growth from the very beginning.

16:14.760 --> 16:17.000
 You never have that in a soup.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.440
 Isn't the entire universe and living organisms

16:20.440 --> 16:25.000
 in the universe, isn't it just soup all the way down?

16:25.000 --> 16:25.840
 Isn't it all soup?

16:25.840 --> 16:27.760
 No, no, I mean, soup almost by definition

16:27.760 --> 16:29.560
 doesn't have a structure.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.200
 But soup is a collection of ingredients

16:32.200 --> 16:34.040
 that are like randomly interacting.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.200
 Yeah, but they're not random.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.760
 They're not, I mean, we have chemistry going on here.

16:38.760 --> 16:41.160
 We have metal grains forming, which are, you know,

16:41.160 --> 16:43.400
 effective oil water interactions.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.960
 Okay, so it feels like there's a direction to a process,

16:45.960 --> 16:47.400
 like a directed process.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.920
 There are directions to processes, yeah.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.640
 And if you're starting with CO2

16:52.640 --> 16:55.600
 and you've got two reactive fluids being brought together

16:55.600 --> 16:57.720
 and they react, what are they gonna make?

16:57.720 --> 16:59.880
 Well, they make carboxylic acids,

16:59.880 --> 17:01.720
 which include the fatty acids

17:01.720 --> 17:03.040
 that make up the cell membranes.

17:03.040 --> 17:06.520
 And they form directly into bilayer membranes.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.720
 They form like soap bubbles.

17:07.720 --> 17:11.240
 It's spontaneous organization caused by the nature

17:11.240 --> 17:12.080
 of the molecules.

17:12.080 --> 17:14.040
 And those things are capable of growing

17:14.040 --> 17:16.440
 and are capable in effect of being selected

17:16.440 --> 17:18.320
 even before there are genes.

17:18.320 --> 17:20.080
 We have this, so we have a lot of order

17:20.080 --> 17:22.560
 and that order is coming from thermodynamics.

17:22.560 --> 17:25.400
 And the thermodynamics is always about increasing

17:25.400 --> 17:27.040
 the entropy of the universe.

17:27.040 --> 17:30.480
 But if you have oil and water and they're separating,

17:30.480 --> 17:32.040
 you're increasing the entropy of the universe,

17:32.040 --> 17:33.160
 even though you've got some order,

17:33.160 --> 17:36.520
 which is the soap and the water are not missable.

17:36.520 --> 17:39.480
 Now, to come back to your first question

17:39.480 --> 17:42.360
 about panspermia properly,

17:43.840 --> 17:45.440
 that just pushes the question somewhere else.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.840
 That just, even if it's true,

17:46.840 --> 17:49.680
 maybe life did start on Earth by panspermia.

17:49.680 --> 17:52.200
 So what are the principles

17:52.200 --> 17:55.200
 that govern the emergence of life on any planet?

17:55.200 --> 17:57.560
 It's an assumption that life started here.

17:57.560 --> 18:01.000
 And it's an assumption that it started

18:01.000 --> 18:02.760
 in a hydrothermal vent or it started

18:02.760 --> 18:04.680
 in a terrestrial geothermal system.

18:04.680 --> 18:07.560
 The question is, can we work out a testable sequence

18:07.560 --> 18:10.440
 of events that would lead from one to the other one

18:10.440 --> 18:12.640
 and then test it and see if there's any truth in it or not?

18:12.640 --> 18:14.880
 With panspermia, you can't do any of that.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.680
 But the fundamental question of panspermia is,

18:17.680 --> 18:21.920
 do we have the machine here on Earth to build life?

18:23.040 --> 18:25.680
 Is the vents enough?

18:25.680 --> 18:30.680
 Is oxygen and hydrogen and whatever the heck else we want

18:31.720 --> 18:34.520
 and some source of energy and heat,

18:34.520 --> 18:36.320
 is that enough to build life?

18:36.320 --> 18:37.280
 Yes.

18:37.280 --> 18:41.480
 Well, that's, of course you would say that as a human.

18:41.480 --> 18:42.800
 Yeah.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.640
 But there could be aliens right now

18:44.640 --> 18:46.160
 chuckling at that idea.

18:46.160 --> 18:50.600
 Maybe you need some special sauce,

18:50.600 --> 18:52.040
 special elsewhere sauce.

18:52.040 --> 18:54.600
 So your sense is we have everything here.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.280
 I mean, this is precisely the question.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.600
 I like to, when I'm talking in schools,

18:59.600 --> 19:00.800
 I like to start out with the idea

19:00.800 --> 19:03.240
 of we can make a time machine.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.120
 We go back four billion years

19:05.120 --> 19:07.400
 and we go to these environments that people talk about.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.280
 We go to a deep sea hydrothermal vent,

19:09.280 --> 19:14.120
 we go to a kind of Yellowstone Park type place environment

19:14.120 --> 19:18.560
 and we find some slime that looks like we can test it.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.240
 It's made of organic molecules.

19:20.240 --> 19:22.400
 It's got a structure which is not obviously cells,

19:22.400 --> 19:25.640
 but you know, is this a stepping stone

19:25.640 --> 19:26.880
 on the way to life or not?

19:26.880 --> 19:27.720
 Yeah.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.080
 How do we know?

19:29.080 --> 19:31.600
 Unless we've got an intellectual framework

19:31.600 --> 19:34.200
 that says this is a stepping stone and that's not a step.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.040
 You know, we'd never know.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.520
 We wouldn't know which environment to go to,

19:36.520 --> 19:38.560
 what to look for, how to say this.

19:38.560 --> 19:39.920
 So all we can ever hope for,

19:39.920 --> 19:41.880
 because we're never gonna build that time machine,

19:41.880 --> 19:43.440
 is to have an intellectual framework

19:43.440 --> 19:46.880
 that can explain step by step, experiment by experiment,

19:46.880 --> 19:49.680
 how we go from a sterile inorganic planet

19:49.680 --> 19:52.480
 to living cells as we know them.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.280
 And in that framework, every time you have a choice,

19:55.280 --> 19:57.000
 it could be this way or it could be that way,

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
 or there's lots of possible forks down that road.

20:02.320 --> 20:03.640
 Did it have to be that way?

20:03.640 --> 20:05.240
 Could it have been the other way?

20:05.240 --> 20:06.560
 And would that have given you life

20:06.560 --> 20:08.840
 with very different properties?

20:08.840 --> 20:11.080
 And so if you come up with a, you know,

20:11.080 --> 20:12.720
 it's a long hypothesis, because as I say,

20:12.720 --> 20:15.560
 we're going from really simple prebiotic chemistry

20:15.560 --> 20:17.840
 all the way through to genes and molecular machines.

20:17.840 --> 20:20.160
 That's a long, long pathway.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.320
 And nobody in the field would agree on the order

20:22.320 --> 20:23.760
 in which these things happened,

20:23.760 --> 20:24.600
 which is not a bad thing,

20:24.600 --> 20:25.800
 because it means that you have to go out

20:25.800 --> 20:27.840
 and do some experiments and try and demonstrate

20:27.840 --> 20:29.840
 that it's possible or not possible.

20:29.840 --> 20:34.840
 It's so freaking amazing that it happened though.

20:37.440 --> 20:41.920
 It feels like there's a direction to the thing.

20:41.920 --> 20:46.920
 Can you try to answer from a framework perspective

20:47.600 --> 20:49.640
 of what is life?

20:49.640 --> 20:54.640
 So you said there's some order and yet there's complexity.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.160
 So it's not perfectly ordered.

20:59.160 --> 21:00.360
 It's not boring.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.040
 There's still some fun in it.

21:02.040 --> 21:05.400
 And it also feels like the processes have a direction

21:06.280 --> 21:07.920
 through the selection mechanism.

21:07.920 --> 21:10.640
 They seem to be building something,

21:10.640 --> 21:14.280
 always better, always improving.

21:14.280 --> 21:15.120
 I mean, maybe it's...

21:15.120 --> 21:16.280
 I mean, that's a perception.

21:16.280 --> 21:19.560
 That's our romanticization of things are always better.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.920
 Things are getting better, we'd like to believe that.

21:22.920 --> 21:24.120
 I mean, you think about the world

21:24.120 --> 21:25.680
 from the point of view of bacteria

21:25.680 --> 21:28.000
 and bacteria are the first things to emerge

21:28.000 --> 21:30.080
 from whatever environment they came from.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.760
 And they dominated the planet very, very quickly.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.480
 And they haven't really changed.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.680
 Four billion years later, they look exactly the same.

21:36.680 --> 21:38.800
 So about four billion years ago,

21:38.800 --> 21:42.440
 bacteria started to really run the show.

21:42.440 --> 21:44.720
 And then nothing happened for a while.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.000
 Nothing happened for two billion years.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.160
 Then after two billion years,

21:48.160 --> 21:51.440
 we see another single event origin, if you like,

21:51.440 --> 21:53.960
 of our own type of cell, the eukaryotic cells.

21:53.960 --> 21:57.280
 So cells with a nucleus and lots of stuff going on inside.

21:57.280 --> 21:58.480
 Another singular origin.

21:58.480 --> 22:01.120
 It only happened once in the history of life on earth.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.360
 Maybe it happened multiple times and there's no evidence.

22:03.360 --> 22:04.360
 Everything just disappeared,

22:04.360 --> 22:07.520
 but we have to at least take it seriously

22:07.520 --> 22:10.040
 that there's something that stops bacteria

22:10.040 --> 22:13.600
 from becoming more complex because they didn't.

22:13.600 --> 22:17.520
 That's a fact that they emerged four billion years ago.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.400
 And something happened two billion years ago,

22:19.400 --> 22:21.320
 but the bacteria themselves didn't change.

22:21.320 --> 22:22.560
 They remain bacterial.

22:22.560 --> 22:26.120
 So there is no trajectory, necessary trajectory

22:26.120 --> 22:28.640
 towards great complexity in human beings at the end of it.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.360
 It's very easy to imagine that without photosynthesis

22:31.360 --> 22:33.060
 arising or without eukaryotes arising,

22:33.060 --> 22:36.400
 that a planet could be full of bacteria and nothing else.

22:36.400 --> 22:39.360
 We'll get to that because that's a brilliant invention.

22:39.360 --> 22:41.560
 And there's a few brilliant invention along the way.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.040
 But what is life?

22:44.040 --> 22:46.000
 If you were to show up on earth,

22:46.000 --> 22:47.840
 but to take that time machine,

22:47.840 --> 22:50.300
 and you said, asking yourself the question,

22:50.300 --> 22:52.760
 is this a stepping stone towards life?

22:52.760 --> 22:57.040
 As you step along, when you see the early bacteria,

22:57.040 --> 22:58.520
 how would you know it's life?

22:59.640 --> 23:01.800
 And then this is really important question

23:01.800 --> 23:04.640
 when you go to other planets and look for life.

23:04.640 --> 23:08.280
 Like what is the framework of telling a difference

23:08.280 --> 23:12.280
 between a rock and a bacteria?

23:12.280 --> 23:15.280
 I mean, the question's kind of both impossible to answer

23:15.280 --> 23:16.540
 and trivial at the same time.

23:16.540 --> 23:18.140
 And I don't like to answer it

23:18.140 --> 23:19.680
 because I don't think there is an answer.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.080
 I think we're trying to describe the process of time.

23:22.080 --> 23:22.920
 Those are the most fun questions.

23:22.920 --> 23:23.760
 What do you mean there's no answer?

23:23.760 --> 23:24.580
 No, there is no answer.

23:24.580 --> 23:25.420
 I mean, there's lots of,

23:25.420 --> 23:27.860
 there are at least 40 or 50 different definitions

23:27.860 --> 23:29.000
 of life out there.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.040
 And most of them are, well, obviously bad

23:33.040 --> 23:34.080
 in one way or another.

23:34.080 --> 23:37.120
 I mean, there's freaks.

23:37.120 --> 23:39.920
 I can never remember the exact words that people use,

23:39.920 --> 23:43.720
 but there's a NASA working definition of life,

23:43.720 --> 23:46.000
 which more or less says a system,

23:46.000 --> 23:49.560
 which is capable of self sustaining system,

23:49.560 --> 23:52.680
 capable of evolution or something along those lines.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.600
 And I immediately have a problem

23:54.600 --> 23:56.200
 with the word self sustaining

23:56.200 --> 23:58.240
 because it's sustained by the environment.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.120
 And I know what they're getting at.

24:00.120 --> 24:01.000
 I know what they're trying to say,

24:01.000 --> 24:03.120
 but I pick a hole in that.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.720
 And there's always wags who say,

24:04.720 --> 24:07.360
 but you know, by that definition, a rabbit is not alive.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.800
 Only a pair of rabbits would be alive

24:09.800 --> 24:12.880
 because a single rabbit is incapable of copying itself.

24:12.880 --> 24:16.080
 There's all kinds of pedantic, silly,

24:16.080 --> 24:19.280
 but also important objections to any hypothesis.

24:19.280 --> 24:22.280
 The real question is what is, you know,

24:22.280 --> 24:24.920
 we can argue all day or people do argue all day

24:24.920 --> 24:27.440
 about is a virus alive or not?

24:27.440 --> 24:29.120
 And it depends on the content.

24:29.120 --> 24:31.360
 Most biologists could not agree about that.

24:31.360 --> 24:32.720
 So then what about a jumping gene,

24:32.720 --> 24:34.920
 a retro element or something that is even simpler

24:34.920 --> 24:39.600
 than a virus, but it's capable of converting

24:39.600 --> 24:41.840
 its environment into a copy of itself.

24:42.920 --> 24:45.200
 And that's about as close, this is not a definition,

24:45.200 --> 24:47.440
 but this is a kind of a description of life

24:47.440 --> 24:52.080
 is that it's able to parasitize the environment.

24:52.080 --> 24:53.920
 And that goes for plants as well as animals

24:53.920 --> 24:58.920
 and bacteria and viruses to make a relatively exact copy

24:58.920 --> 25:03.920
 of themselves, informationally exact copy of themselves.

25:04.120 --> 25:06.160
 By the way, it doesn't really have to be

25:06.160 --> 25:07.680
 a copy of itself, right?

25:07.680 --> 25:10.320
 It just has to be, you have to create something

25:11.480 --> 25:16.400
 that's interesting, the way evolution is.

25:16.400 --> 25:19.920
 So it is extremely powerful process of evolution,

25:19.920 --> 25:22.360
 which is basically make a copy of yourself

25:22.360 --> 25:25.080
 and sometimes mess up a little bit.

25:25.080 --> 25:26.440
 That seems to work really well.

25:26.440 --> 25:30.360
 I wonder if it's possible to mess up big time

25:30.360 --> 25:32.360
 as a standard, as a default.

25:32.360 --> 25:36.880
 It's called a hopeful monster and in principle it can.

25:36.880 --> 25:40.520
 Actually, it turns out, I would say that this is due

25:40.520 --> 25:43.200
 a reemergence, this is some amazing work

25:43.200 --> 25:45.320
 from Michael Levin, I don't know if you came across him,

25:45.320 --> 25:47.360
 but if you haven't interviewed him,

25:47.360 --> 25:50.800
 you should interview him about, yeah.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.640
 I'm talking to him in a few days.

25:53.640 --> 25:54.480
 Oh, fantastic.

25:54.480 --> 25:59.320
 So I mentioned, there's two people that Andre,

25:59.320 --> 26:02.360
 if I may mention, Andre Kapathe is a friend

26:02.360 --> 26:04.600
 who's really admired in the AI community,

26:04.600 --> 26:09.600
 said you absolutely must talk to Michael and to Nick.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.800
 So of course, I'm a huge fan of yours,

26:11.800 --> 26:14.120
 so I'm really fortunate that we can actually

26:14.120 --> 26:14.960
 make this happen.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.080
 Anyway, you were saying?

26:16.080 --> 26:19.280
 Well, Michael Levin is doing amazing work,

26:19.280 --> 26:22.160
 basically about the way in which electrical fields

26:22.160 --> 26:25.640
 control development and he's done some work

26:25.640 --> 26:27.880
 with planarian worms, so flat worms,

26:27.880 --> 26:29.400
 where he'll tell you all about this,

26:29.400 --> 26:30.800
 so I won't say any more than the minimum,

26:30.800 --> 26:32.440
 but basically you can cut their head off

26:32.440 --> 26:35.640
 and they'll redevelop a different, a new head.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.680
 But the head that they develop depends,

26:37.680 --> 26:42.520
 if you knock out just one iron pump in a membrane,

26:42.520 --> 26:45.240
 so you change the electrical circuitry just a little bit,

26:45.240 --> 26:47.000
 you can come up with a completely different head.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.600
 It can be a head which is similar to those

26:49.600 --> 26:52.080
 that diverged 150 million years ago

26:52.080 --> 26:54.200
 or it can be a head which no one's ever seen before,

26:54.200 --> 26:56.760
 a different kind of head.

26:56.760 --> 26:59.320
 Now that is really, you might say, a hopeful monster.

26:59.320 --> 27:02.000
 This is a kind of leap into a different direction.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.040
 The only question for natural selection is does it work?

27:05.040 --> 27:08.200
 Is the change itself feasible as a single change?

27:08.200 --> 27:09.880
 And the answer is yes, it's just a small change

27:09.880 --> 27:11.080
 to a single gene.

27:11.080 --> 27:12.900
 And the second thing is it gives rise

27:12.900 --> 27:14.880
 to a completely different morphology.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.000
 Does it work?

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
 And if it works, that can easily be a shift.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.400
 But for it to be a speciation, for it to continue,

27:25.400 --> 27:29.720
 for it to give rise to a different morphology over time,

27:29.720 --> 27:32.000
 then it has to be perpetuated.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
 So that shift, that change in that one gene

27:37.200 --> 27:41.100
 has to work well enough that it is selected and it goes on.

27:41.100 --> 27:44.320
 And copied enough times to where you can really test it.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.040
 So the likelihood, it would be lost,

27:46.040 --> 27:48.780
 but there will be some occasions where it survives.

27:48.780 --> 27:51.920
 And yes, the idea that we can have sudden, fairly abrupt

27:51.920 --> 27:54.940
 changes in evolution, I think it's time for a rebirth.

27:54.940 --> 27:58.640
 What about this idea that kind of trying to

27:58.640 --> 28:03.640
 mathematize a definition of life and saying how many steps,

28:04.500 --> 28:07.100
 the shortest amount of steps it takes to build the thing,

28:07.100 --> 28:09.660
 almost like an engineering view of it?

28:09.660 --> 28:11.880
 Ah, I like that view.

28:11.880 --> 28:14.560
 Because I think that in a sense, that's not very far away

28:14.560 --> 28:17.340
 from what a hypothesis needs to do

28:17.340 --> 28:19.520
 to be a testable hypothesis for the origin of life.

28:19.520 --> 28:22.440
 You need to spell out, here's each step,

28:22.440 --> 28:24.960
 and here's the experiment to do for each step.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.960
 The idea that we can do it in the lab,

28:26.960 --> 28:29.820
 some people say, oh, we'll have created life

28:29.820 --> 28:32.680
 within five years, but ask them what they mean by life.

28:34.560 --> 28:36.680
 We have a planet four billion years ago

28:36.680 --> 28:39.280
 with these vent systems across the entire surface

28:39.280 --> 28:41.880
 of the planet, and we have millions of years if we wanted.

28:41.880 --> 28:43.400
 I have a feeling that we're not talking about

28:43.400 --> 28:44.240
 millions of years.

28:44.240 --> 28:47.880
 I have a feeling we're talking about maybe millions

28:47.880 --> 28:49.520
 of nanoseconds or picoseconds.

28:49.520 --> 28:52.320
 We're talking about chemistry, which is happening quickly.

28:53.880 --> 28:56.780
 But we still need to constrain those steps,

28:56.780 --> 29:00.880
 but we've got a planet doing similar chemistry.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.660
 You asked about a trajectory.

29:02.660 --> 29:05.260
 The trajectory is the planetary trajectory.

29:05.260 --> 29:06.760
 The planet has properties.

29:06.760 --> 29:08.680
 Basically, it's got a lot of iron at the center of it.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.480
 It's got a lot of electrons at the center of it.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.040
 It's more oxidized on the outside,

29:12.040 --> 29:15.200
 partly because of the sun and partly because the heat

29:15.200 --> 29:17.720
 of volcanoes puts out oxidized gases.

29:17.720 --> 29:19.640
 So the planet is a battery.

29:19.640 --> 29:23.400
 It's a giant battery, and we have a flow of electrons

29:23.400 --> 29:26.200
 going from inside to outside in these hydrothermal vents,

29:26.200 --> 29:29.120
 and that's the same topology that a cell has.

29:29.120 --> 29:32.780
 A cell is basically just a micro version of the planet,

29:34.160 --> 29:37.000
 and there is a trajectory in all of that,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.360
 and there's an inevitability that certain types

29:39.360 --> 29:42.360
 of chemical reaction are going to be favored over others,

29:42.360 --> 29:46.240
 and there's an inevitability in what happens in water,

29:46.240 --> 29:47.880
 the chemistry that happens in water.

29:47.880 --> 29:51.840
 Some will be immiscible with water and will form membranes

29:51.840 --> 29:53.320
 and will form insoluble structures,

29:53.320 --> 29:57.300
 and nobody really understands water very well,

29:58.280 --> 30:00.680
 and it's another big question.

30:00.680 --> 30:04.440
 For experiments on the origin of life, what do you put it in?

30:04.440 --> 30:07.200
 What kind of structure do we want to induce in this water?

30:07.200 --> 30:08.840
 Because the last thing it's likely to be

30:08.840 --> 30:11.640
 is just kind of bulk water.

30:11.640 --> 30:14.240
 How fundamental is water to life, would you say?

30:14.240 --> 30:16.420
 I would say pretty fundamental.

30:17.800 --> 30:20.040
 I wouldn't like to say it's impossible for life

30:20.040 --> 30:25.040
 to start any other way, but water is everywhere.

30:26.060 --> 30:27.760
 Water's extremely good at what it does,

30:27.760 --> 30:31.160
 and carbon works in water especially well.

30:31.160 --> 30:33.240
 So those things, and carbon is everywhere.

30:33.240 --> 30:35.660
 So those things together make me think probabilistically,

30:35.660 --> 30:39.160
 if we found a thousand life forms, 995 of them

30:39.160 --> 30:41.920
 would be carbon based and living in water.

30:41.920 --> 30:45.400
 Now the reverse question, if you found a puddle of water

30:45.400 --> 30:50.200
 elsewhere and some carbon, no, just a puddle of water.

30:50.200 --> 30:53.240
 Is a puddle of water a pretty damn good indication

30:53.240 --> 30:58.240
 that life either exists here or has once existed here?

31:00.960 --> 31:02.340
 No.

31:02.340 --> 31:04.040
 So it doesn't work the other way.

31:04.040 --> 31:07.580
 I think you need a living planet.

31:07.580 --> 31:09.100
 You need a planet which is capable

31:09.100 --> 31:10.740
 of turning over its surface.

31:10.740 --> 31:12.860
 It needs to be a planet with water.

31:12.860 --> 31:16.880
 It needs to be capable of bringing those electrons

31:16.880 --> 31:18.140
 from inside to the outside.

31:18.140 --> 31:19.660
 It needs to turn over its surface.

31:19.660 --> 31:22.920
 It needs to make that water work and turn it into hydrogen.

31:22.920 --> 31:24.740
 So I think you need a living planet.

31:24.740 --> 31:25.940
 But once you've got the living planet,

31:25.940 --> 31:29.420
 I think the rest of it is kind of thermodynamics all the way.

31:29.420 --> 31:34.420
 So if you were to run Earth over a million times up

31:34.500 --> 31:37.820
 to this point, maybe beyond, to the end,

31:37.820 --> 31:41.420
 let's run it to the end, what is it?

31:41.420 --> 31:42.980
 How much variety is there?

31:42.980 --> 31:45.060
 You kind of spoke to this trajectory

31:45.060 --> 31:49.900
 that the environment dictates chemically,

31:49.900 --> 31:53.560
 I don't know in which other way, spiritually,

31:53.560 --> 31:57.100
 I don't know, like dictates kind of the direction

31:57.100 --> 32:01.900
 of this giant machine that seems chaotic,

32:01.900 --> 32:06.180
 but it does seem to have order in the steps it's taking.

32:06.180 --> 32:11.180
 How often will life, how often will bacteria emerge?

32:11.420 --> 32:13.420
 How often will something like humans emerge?

32:13.420 --> 32:15.320
 How much variety do you think there would be?

32:15.320 --> 32:19.400
 I think at the level of bacteria, not much variety.

32:19.400 --> 32:22.120
 I think we would get, that's how many times

32:22.120 --> 32:24.620
 you say you want to run it, a million times.

32:24.620 --> 32:28.020
 I would say at least a few hundred thousand will get bacteria again.

32:28.020 --> 32:29.460
 Oh, wow, nice.

32:29.460 --> 32:31.860
 Because I think there's some level of inevitability

32:31.860 --> 32:33.980
 that a wet rocky planet will give rise

32:33.980 --> 32:38.260
 through the same processes to something very close.

32:38.260 --> 32:40.460
 I think this is not something I'd have thought

32:40.460 --> 32:43.380
 a few years ago, but working with a PhD student

32:43.380 --> 32:45.060
 of mine, Stuart Harrison, he's been thinking

32:45.060 --> 32:47.580
 about the genetic code, and we've just been publishing

32:47.580 --> 32:51.580
 on that, there are patterns that you can discern in the code,

32:51.580 --> 32:53.440
 or he has discerned in the code,

32:53.440 --> 32:56.100
 that if you think about them in terms of,

32:56.100 --> 32:57.780
 we start with CO2 and hydrogen,

32:57.780 --> 32:59.780
 and these are the first steps of biochemistry,

32:59.780 --> 33:01.660
 you come up with a code which is very similar

33:01.660 --> 33:03.660
 to the code that we see.

33:03.660 --> 33:05.580
 So it wouldn't surprise me any longer

33:05.580 --> 33:07.800
 if we found life on Mars and it had a genetic code

33:07.800 --> 33:09.780
 that was not very different to the genetic code

33:09.780 --> 33:13.340
 that we have here, without it just being transferred across.

33:13.340 --> 33:16.180
 There's some inevitability about the whole

33:16.180 --> 33:18.580
 of the beginnings of life, in my view.

33:18.580 --> 33:21.540
 That's really promising, because if the basic chemistry

33:21.540 --> 33:25.940
 is tightly linked to the genetic code,

33:25.940 --> 33:29.540
 that means we can interact with other life

33:29.540 --> 33:30.500
 if it exists out there.

33:30.500 --> 33:32.140
 Well, that's potentially.

33:32.140 --> 33:34.620
 That's really exciting, if that's the case.

33:34.620 --> 33:36.060
 Okay, but then bacteria.

33:36.060 --> 33:37.800
 We've got bacteria.

33:37.800 --> 33:39.180
 Yeah.

33:39.180 --> 33:41.200
 How easy is photosynthesis?

33:42.920 --> 33:44.880
 Much harder, I would say.

33:44.880 --> 33:46.060
 Let's actually go there.

33:46.060 --> 33:47.620
 Let's go through the inventions.

33:47.620 --> 33:49.160
 Yeah.

33:49.160 --> 33:51.240
 What is photosynthesis?

33:51.240 --> 33:52.420
 And why is it hard?

33:52.420 --> 33:55.340
 Well, there are different forms.

33:55.340 --> 33:57.500
 I mean, basically, you're taking hydrogen

33:57.500 --> 33:59.000
 and you're sticking it onto CO2,

33:59.000 --> 34:00.340
 and it's powered by the sun.

34:00.340 --> 34:02.860
 Question is, where are you taking the hydrogen from?

34:02.860 --> 34:05.340
 And in photosynthesis that we know in plants,

34:05.340 --> 34:06.760
 it's coming from water.

34:06.760 --> 34:08.840
 So you're using the power of the sun to split water,

34:08.840 --> 34:11.480
 take out the hydrogen, stick it onto CO2,

34:11.480 --> 34:13.100
 and the oxygen is a waste product,

34:13.100 --> 34:15.660
 and you just throw it out, throw it away.

34:15.660 --> 34:19.100
 So it's the single greatest planetary pollution event

34:19.100 --> 34:21.340
 in the whole history of the Earth.

34:21.340 --> 34:22.460
 The pollutant being oxygen.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.000
 Yes, yeah.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.200
 It also made possible animals.

34:26.200 --> 34:28.460
 You can't have large, active animals

34:28.460 --> 34:30.020
 without an oxygenated atmosphere,

34:30.020 --> 34:33.700
 at least not in the sense that we know on Earth.

34:33.700 --> 34:35.540
 So that's a really big invention

34:35.540 --> 34:37.540
 in the history of Earth. Huge invention, yes.

34:37.540 --> 34:38.460
 And it happened once.

34:38.460 --> 34:40.380
 There's a few things that happen once on Earth,

34:40.380 --> 34:42.680
 and you're always stuck with this problem.

34:42.680 --> 34:44.780
 Once it happened, did it become so good so quickly

34:44.780 --> 34:48.300
 that it precluded the same thing happening ever again?

34:48.300 --> 34:49.500
 Or are there other reasons?

34:49.500 --> 34:51.220
 And we really have to look at each one in turn

34:51.220 --> 34:53.980
 and think, why did it only happen once?

34:53.980 --> 34:57.980
 In this case, it's really difficult to split water.

34:57.980 --> 34:59.140
 It requires a lot of power,

34:59.140 --> 35:01.800
 and that power, you're effectively separating charge

35:01.800 --> 35:04.040
 across a membrane, and the way in which you do it,

35:04.040 --> 35:05.340
 if it doesn't all rush back

35:05.340 --> 35:08.260
 and kind of cause an explosion right at the site,

35:08.260 --> 35:10.700
 requires really careful wiring.

35:10.700 --> 35:14.740
 And that wiring, it can't be easy to get it right

35:14.740 --> 35:18.700
 because the plants that we see around us,

35:18.700 --> 35:19.540
 they have chloroplasts.

35:19.540 --> 35:21.340
 Those chloroplasts were cyanobacteria ones.

35:21.340 --> 35:23.620
 Those cyanobacteria are the only group of bacteria

35:23.620 --> 35:25.740
 that can do that type of photosynthesis.

35:25.740 --> 35:28.220
 So there's plenty of opportunity.

35:28.220 --> 35:29.520
 So not even many bacteria.

35:29.520 --> 35:32.180
 So who invented photosynthesis?

35:32.180 --> 35:34.180
 The cyanobacteria, or their ancestors.

35:34.180 --> 35:36.020
 And there's not many?

35:36.020 --> 35:37.740
 No other bacteria can do

35:37.740 --> 35:39.740
 what's called oxygenic photosynthesis.

35:39.740 --> 35:42.100
 Lots of other bacteria can split.

35:42.100 --> 35:44.080
 I mean, you can take your hydrogen from somewhere else.

35:44.080 --> 35:45.500
 You can take it from hydrogen sulfide

35:45.500 --> 35:47.220
 bubbling out of a hydrothermal vent.

35:47.220 --> 35:49.460
 Grab your two hydrogens.

35:49.460 --> 35:51.060
 The sulfur is the waste now.

35:52.100 --> 35:53.300
 You can do it from iron.

35:53.300 --> 35:54.220
 You can take electrons.

35:54.220 --> 35:56.060
 So the early oceans were probably full of iron.

35:56.060 --> 35:59.020
 You can take an electron from ferrous iron,

35:59.020 --> 36:01.620
 so iron two plus and make it iron three plus,

36:01.620 --> 36:03.960
 which now precipitates as rust,

36:03.960 --> 36:07.620
 and you take a proton from the acidic early ocean,

36:07.620 --> 36:08.440
 stick it there.

36:08.440 --> 36:09.300
 Now you've got a hydrogen atom.

36:09.300 --> 36:10.720
 Stick it onto CO2.

36:10.720 --> 36:12.380
 You've just done the trick.

36:12.380 --> 36:16.460
 The trouble is you bury yourself in rusty iron.

36:16.460 --> 36:18.540
 And with sulfur, you can bury yourself in sulfur.

36:18.540 --> 36:20.700
 One of the reasons oxygenic photosynthesis

36:20.700 --> 36:23.340
 is so much better is that the waste product is oxygen,

36:23.340 --> 36:24.540
 which just bubbles away.

36:26.420 --> 36:29.220
 That seems like extremely unlikely,

36:29.220 --> 36:30.740
 and it's extremely essential

36:30.740 --> 36:32.700
 for the evolution of complex organisms

36:33.720 --> 36:35.160
 because of all the oxygen.

36:36.120 --> 36:39.420
 Yeah, and that didn't accumulate quickly either.

36:39.420 --> 36:42.060
 So it's converting, what is it?

36:42.060 --> 36:43.900
 It's converting energy from the sun

36:44.820 --> 36:46.960
 and the resource of water

36:46.960 --> 36:49.940
 into the resource needed for animals.

36:50.820 --> 36:52.400
 Both resources needed for animals.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.540
 We need to eat, and we need to burn the food,

36:54.540 --> 36:57.780
 and we're eating plants,

36:57.780 --> 36:59.300
 which are getting their energy from the sun,

36:59.300 --> 37:01.260
 and we're burning it with their waste product,

37:01.260 --> 37:02.540
 which is the oxygen.

37:02.540 --> 37:04.620
 So there's a lot of kind of circularity in that,

37:04.620 --> 37:07.880
 but without an oxygenated planet,

37:07.880 --> 37:12.560
 you couldn't really have predation.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.980
 You can have animals,

37:14.980 --> 37:16.240
 but you can't really have animals

37:16.240 --> 37:17.440
 that go around and eat each other.

37:17.440 --> 37:19.900
 You can't have ecosystems as we know them.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.120
 Well, let's actually step back.

37:21.120 --> 37:25.620
 What about eukaryotic versus prokaryotic cells, prokaryotes?

37:25.620 --> 37:28.420
 What are each of those,

37:28.420 --> 37:31.060
 and how big of an invention is that?

37:31.060 --> 37:33.380
 I personally think that's the single biggest invention

37:33.380 --> 37:34.820
 in the whole history of life.

37:34.820 --> 37:35.900
 Exciting.

37:35.900 --> 37:36.900
 So what are they?

37:36.900 --> 37:37.740
 Can you explain?

37:37.740 --> 37:40.780
 Yeah, so I mentioned bacteria and archaea.

37:40.780 --> 37:43.020
 These are both prokaryotes.

37:43.020 --> 37:45.740
 They're basically small cells that don't have a nucleus.

37:45.740 --> 37:47.060
 If you look at them under a microscope,

37:47.060 --> 37:48.140
 you don't see much going on.

37:48.140 --> 37:50.640
 If you look at them under a super resolution microscope,

37:50.640 --> 37:53.220
 then they're fantastically complex.

37:53.220 --> 37:55.460
 In terms of their molecular machinery, they're amazing.

37:55.460 --> 37:58.360
 In terms of their morphological appearance

37:58.360 --> 38:03.060
 under a microscope, they're really small and really simple.

38:03.060 --> 38:04.900
 The earliest life that we can physically see

38:04.900 --> 38:06.380
 on the planet are stromatolites,

38:06.380 --> 38:08.500
 which are made by things like cyanobacteria,

38:08.500 --> 38:11.020
 and they're large superstructures.

38:11.020 --> 38:14.420
 Effectively, biofilms plated on top of each other,

38:14.420 --> 38:17.360
 and you end up with quite large structures

38:17.360 --> 38:19.780
 that you can see in the fossil record.

38:19.780 --> 38:23.100
 But they never came up with animals.

38:23.100 --> 38:24.320
 They never came up with plants.

38:24.320 --> 38:26.660
 They came up with multicellular things,

38:26.660 --> 38:28.620
 filamentous cyanobacteria, for example.

38:28.620 --> 38:31.420
 They're just long strings of cells.

38:31.420 --> 38:34.500
 But the origin of the eukaryotic cell

38:34.500 --> 38:37.300
 seems to have been what's called an endosymbiosis,

38:37.300 --> 38:39.620
 so one cell gets inside another cell.

38:39.620 --> 38:42.160
 And I think that that's transformed

38:42.160 --> 38:43.780
 the energetic possibilities of life.

38:43.780 --> 38:48.160
 So what we end up with is a kind of supercharged cell,

38:48.160 --> 38:50.460
 which can have a much larger nucleus

38:50.460 --> 38:54.180
 with many more genes, all supported.

38:54.180 --> 38:55.780
 If you think about it, you could think about it

38:55.780 --> 38:58.340
 as multi bacterial power without the overhead.

38:58.340 --> 39:00.860
 So you've got a cell and it's got bacteria living in it,

39:00.860 --> 39:02.260
 and those bacteria are providing it

39:02.260 --> 39:04.700
 with the energy currency it needs.

39:04.700 --> 39:07.060
 But each bacterium has a genome of its own,

39:07.060 --> 39:10.340
 which costs a fair amount of energy to express,

39:10.340 --> 39:13.920
 to kind of turn over and convert into proteins and so on.

39:15.060 --> 39:16.780
 What the mitochondria did,

39:16.780 --> 39:20.500
 which are these power packs in our own cells,

39:20.500 --> 39:22.340
 they were bacteria once,

39:22.340 --> 39:24.100
 and they threw away virtually all their genes.

39:24.100 --> 39:25.660
 They've only got a few left.

39:25.660 --> 39:27.720
 So mitochondria is, like you said,

39:27.720 --> 39:30.120
 is the bacteria that got inside a cell

39:30.120 --> 39:32.300
 and then throw away all this stuff it doesn't need to,

39:32.300 --> 39:35.260
 survive inside the cell, and then kept what?

39:35.260 --> 39:36.340
 So what we end up with,

39:36.340 --> 39:38.820
 so it kept always a handful of genes.

39:38.820 --> 39:41.580
 In our own case, 37 genes.

39:41.580 --> 39:44.620
 But there's a few protists, which are single celled things

39:44.620 --> 39:47.220
 that have got as many as 70 or 80 genes.

39:47.220 --> 39:50.220
 So it's not always the same, but it's always a small number.

39:51.220 --> 39:54.180
 And you can think of it as a paired down power pack

39:54.180 --> 39:56.020
 where the control unit has really been,

39:56.020 --> 39:58.800
 has been kind of paired down to almost nothing.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.860
 So you're putting out the same power,

40:00.860 --> 40:04.380
 but the investment in the overheads is really paired down.

40:04.380 --> 40:05.740
 That means that you can support

40:05.740 --> 40:08.420
 a much larger nuclear genome.

40:08.420 --> 40:10.540
 So we've gone up in the number of genes,

40:10.540 --> 40:12.220
 but also the amount of power you have

40:12.220 --> 40:14.080
 to convert those genes into proteins.

40:14.940 --> 40:17.100
 We've gone up about fourfold in the number of genes,

40:17.100 --> 40:19.260
 but in terms of the size of genomes

40:19.260 --> 40:21.840
 and your ability to make the building blocks,

40:21.840 --> 40:25.100
 make the proteins, we've gone up 100,000 fold or more.

40:25.100 --> 40:29.540
 So it's huge step change in the possibilities of evolution.

40:29.540 --> 40:33.980
 And it's interesting then that the only two occasions

40:33.980 --> 40:35.900
 that complex life has arisen on Earth,

40:35.900 --> 40:37.180
 plants and animals,

40:38.060 --> 40:40.140
 fungi you could say are complex as well,

40:40.140 --> 40:42.820
 but they don't form such complex morphology

40:42.820 --> 40:44.540
 as plants and animals.

40:44.540 --> 40:45.660
 Start with a single cell.

40:45.660 --> 40:48.380
 They start with an oocyte and a sperm

40:48.380 --> 40:50.420
 fused together to make a zygote.

40:50.420 --> 40:52.300
 So we start development with a single cell

40:52.300 --> 40:56.460
 and all the cells in the organism have identical DNA.

40:56.460 --> 40:58.340
 And you switch off in the brain,

40:58.340 --> 41:00.540
 you switch off these genes and you switch on those genes

41:00.540 --> 41:01.700
 and liver, you switch off those

41:01.700 --> 41:04.060
 and you switch on a different set.

41:04.060 --> 41:06.120
 And the standard evolutionary explanation for that

41:06.120 --> 41:08.580
 is that you're restricting conflict.

41:08.580 --> 41:10.980
 You don't have a load of genetically different cells

41:10.980 --> 41:13.340
 that are all fighting each other.

41:13.340 --> 41:14.700
 And so it works.

41:14.700 --> 41:17.180
 The trouble with bacteria, they form these biofilms

41:17.180 --> 41:18.520
 and they're all genetically different.

41:18.520 --> 41:21.020
 And effectively they're incapable

41:21.020 --> 41:23.300
 of that level of cooperation.

41:23.300 --> 41:24.600
 They would get in a fight.

41:26.380 --> 41:30.060
 Okay, so why is this such a difficult invention

41:31.180 --> 41:33.380
 of getting this bacteria inside

41:33.380 --> 41:37.300
 and becoming an engine which the mitochondria is?

41:37.300 --> 41:40.420
 Why do you assign it such great importance?

41:40.420 --> 41:42.180
 Is it great importance in terms of the difficulty

41:42.180 --> 41:44.300
 of how it was to achieve or great importance

41:44.300 --> 41:46.900
 in terms of the impact it had on life?

41:46.900 --> 41:48.380
 Both.

41:48.380 --> 41:49.780
 It had a huge impact on life

41:49.780 --> 41:52.500
 because if that had not happened,

41:52.500 --> 41:54.940
 you can be certain that life on earth

41:54.940 --> 41:56.500
 would be bacterial only.

41:56.500 --> 41:58.180
 And that took a really long time too.

41:58.180 --> 41:59.940
 It took 2 billion years.

41:59.940 --> 42:02.740
 And it hasn't happened since to the best of our knowledge.

42:02.740 --> 42:05.100
 So it looks as if it's genuinely difficult.

42:05.100 --> 42:06.200
 And if you think about it then

42:06.200 --> 42:08.500
 from just an informational perspective,

42:08.500 --> 42:12.380
 you think bacteria have got,

42:12.380 --> 42:15.260
 they structure their information differently.

42:15.260 --> 42:17.540
 So a bacterial cell has a small genome,

42:17.540 --> 42:19.060
 you might have 4,000 genes in it,

42:19.060 --> 42:21.100
 but a single E. coli cell has access

42:21.100 --> 42:24.060
 to about 30,000 genes potentially.

42:24.060 --> 42:26.020
 It's got a kind of metagenome

42:26.020 --> 42:27.860
 where other E. coli out there

42:27.860 --> 42:29.060
 have got different gene sets

42:29.060 --> 42:31.820
 and they can switch them around between themselves.

42:31.820 --> 42:34.580
 And so you can generate a huge amount of variation

42:34.580 --> 42:36.220
 and they've got more,

42:36.220 --> 42:40.620
 an E. coli metagenome is larger than the human genome.

42:40.620 --> 42:43.220
 We own 20,000 genes or something.

42:43.220 --> 42:46.900
 So, and they've had 4 billion years of evolution

42:46.900 --> 42:48.540
 to work out what can I do

42:48.540 --> 42:51.540
 and what can't I do with this metagenome?

42:51.540 --> 42:54.300
 And the answer is you're stuck, you're still bacteria.

42:54.300 --> 42:58.940
 So they have explored genetic sequence space

42:58.940 --> 43:01.260
 far more thoroughly than eukaryotes ever did

43:01.260 --> 43:03.060
 because they've had twice as long at least

43:03.060 --> 43:05.940
 and they've got much larger populations

43:05.940 --> 43:08.420
 and they never got around this problem.

43:08.420 --> 43:09.340
 So why can't they?

43:09.340 --> 43:12.420
 It seems as if you can't solve it with information alone.

43:12.420 --> 43:14.860
 So what's the problem?

43:14.860 --> 43:16.400
 The problem is structure.

43:16.400 --> 43:21.020
 If the very first cells needed an electrical charge

43:21.020 --> 43:23.820
 on their membrane to grow and in bacteria,

43:23.820 --> 43:26.220
 it's the outer membrane that surrounds the cell

43:26.220 --> 43:28.220
 which is electrically charged.

43:28.220 --> 43:29.740
 You try and scale that up

43:29.740 --> 43:31.940
 and you've got a fundamental design problem,

43:31.940 --> 43:33.680
 you've got an engineering problem.

43:33.680 --> 43:35.260
 And there are examples of it

43:35.260 --> 43:37.080
 and what we see in all these cases

43:37.080 --> 43:38.780
 is what's known as extreme polyploidy,

43:38.780 --> 43:41.020
 which is to say they have tens of thousands of copies

43:41.020 --> 43:42.740
 of their complete genome,

43:42.740 --> 43:45.520
 which is energetically hugely expensive

43:45.520 --> 43:49.020
 and you end up with a large bacteria

43:49.020 --> 43:52.340
 with no further development.

43:52.340 --> 43:55.020
 What you need is to incorporate

43:55.020 --> 43:58.500
 these electrically charged power pack units inside

43:58.500 --> 44:01.380
 with their control units intact

44:01.380 --> 44:03.980
 and for them not to conflict so much with the host cell

44:03.980 --> 44:05.900
 that it all goes wrong.

44:05.900 --> 44:07.860
 Perhaps it goes wrong more often than not.

44:07.860 --> 44:10.940
 And then you change the topology of the cell.

44:10.940 --> 44:14.220
 Now you don't necessarily have any more DNA

44:14.220 --> 44:16.740
 than a giant bacterium with extreme polyploidy,

44:16.740 --> 44:19.340
 but what you've got is an asymmetry.

44:19.340 --> 44:21.940
 You now have a giant nuclear genome

44:21.940 --> 44:25.640
 which surrounded by lots of subsidiary energetic genomes

44:25.640 --> 44:27.920
 that do all the, they're the control units

44:27.920 --> 44:32.340
 that are doing all the control of energy generation.

44:32.340 --> 44:33.980
 Could this have been done gradually

44:33.980 --> 44:35.900
 or does it have to be done,

44:35.900 --> 44:38.180
 the power pack has to be all intact

44:38.180 --> 44:40.180
 and ready to go and working?

44:40.180 --> 44:41.860
 I mean, it's a kind of step change

44:41.860 --> 44:43.420
 in the possibilities of evolution,

44:43.420 --> 44:44.540
 but it doesn't happen overnight.

44:44.540 --> 44:47.700
 It's gonna still require multiple, multiple generations.

44:47.700 --> 44:50.900
 So it could take millions of years.

44:50.900 --> 44:52.220
 It could take shorter times.

44:52.220 --> 44:54.100
 There's another thing I would like to put the number of steps

44:54.100 --> 44:56.180
 and try and work out what's required at each step.

44:56.180 --> 44:58.500
 And we are trying to do that with sex for example.

44:58.500 --> 45:00.820
 You can't have a very large genome

45:00.820 --> 45:02.220
 unless you have sex at that point.

45:02.220 --> 45:03.340
 So what are the changes to go

45:03.340 --> 45:07.060
 from bacterial recombination to eukaryotic recombination?

45:07.860 --> 45:09.540
 What do you need to do?

45:09.540 --> 45:12.340
 Why do we go from passing around bits of DNA

45:12.340 --> 45:15.340
 as if it's loose change to fusing cells together,

45:15.340 --> 45:16.580
 lining up the chromosomes,

45:16.580 --> 45:18.620
 recombining across the chromosomes,

45:18.620 --> 45:20.820
 and then going through two rounds of cell division

45:20.820 --> 45:22.340
 to produce your gametes?

45:22.340 --> 45:24.440
 All eukaryotes do it that way.

45:24.440 --> 45:27.420
 So again, why switch?

45:27.420 --> 45:28.780
 What are the drivers here?

45:28.780 --> 45:31.420
 So there's a lot of time, there's a lot of evolution,

45:31.420 --> 45:34.100
 but as soon as you've got cells living inside another cell,

45:34.100 --> 45:36.340
 what you've got is a new design.

45:36.340 --> 45:39.100
 You've got new potential that you didn't have before.

45:39.100 --> 45:43.300
 So the cell living inside another cell, that design

45:44.220 --> 45:48.700
 allows for better storage of information,

45:48.700 --> 45:52.780
 better use of energy, more delegation,

45:52.780 --> 45:55.420
 like a hierarchical control of the whole thing.

45:55.420 --> 45:58.340
 And then somehow that leads to ability

45:58.340 --> 46:00.180
 to have multi cell organisms.

46:00.180 --> 46:03.300
 I'm not sure that you have hierarchical control necessarily,

46:03.300 --> 46:06.460
 but you've got a system where you can have

46:06.460 --> 46:09.940
 a much larger information storage depot in the nucleus.

46:09.940 --> 46:11.700
 You can have a much larger genome.

46:11.700 --> 46:13.620
 And that allows multicellularity, yes,

46:13.620 --> 46:18.500
 because it allows you, it's a funny thing,

46:18.500 --> 46:23.500
 to have an animal where I have 70% of my genes

46:24.140 --> 46:25.260
 switched on in my brain,

46:25.260 --> 46:28.500
 and a different 50% switched on in my liver or something,

46:28.500 --> 46:30.860
 you've got to have all those genes in the egg cell

46:30.860 --> 46:31.780
 at the very beginning,

46:31.780 --> 46:35.500
 and you've got to have a program of development

46:35.500 --> 46:37.900
 which says, okay, you guys switch off those genes

46:37.900 --> 46:40.300
 and switch on those genes, and you guys, you do that.

46:40.300 --> 46:42.180
 But all the genes are there at the beginning.

46:42.180 --> 46:44.100
 That means you've got to have a lot of genes in one cell

46:44.100 --> 46:45.620
 and you've got to be able to maintain them.

46:45.620 --> 46:47.660
 And the problem with bacteria is they don't get close

46:47.660 --> 46:49.900
 to having enough genes in one cell.

46:49.900 --> 46:52.760
 So if you were to try and make a multicellular organism

46:52.760 --> 46:54.500
 from bacteria, you'd bring different types

46:54.500 --> 46:56.540
 of bacteria together and hope they'll cooperate.

46:56.540 --> 46:57.940
 And the reality is they don't.

46:57.940 --> 46:59.540
 That's really, really tough to do.

46:59.540 --> 47:00.380
 Yeah.

47:00.380 --> 47:02.700
 We know they don't because it doesn't exist.

47:02.700 --> 47:04.580
 We have the data as far as we know.

47:04.580 --> 47:06.420
 I'm sure there's a few special ones

47:06.420 --> 47:08.180
 and they dead off quickly.

47:08.180 --> 47:09.980
 I'd love to know some of the most fun things

47:09.980 --> 47:11.760
 bacteria have done since.

47:12.660 --> 47:13.500
 Oh, there's a few.

47:13.500 --> 47:15.460
 I mean, they can do some pretty funky things.

47:15.460 --> 47:18.260
 And this is broad brushstroke that I'm talking about.

47:18.260 --> 47:19.200
 Yes.

47:19.200 --> 47:20.220
 Generally speaking.

47:21.060 --> 47:25.060
 So how was, so another fun invention.

47:25.060 --> 47:27.820
 Us humans seem to utilize it well,

47:27.820 --> 47:31.540
 but you say it's also very important early on is sex.

47:31.540 --> 47:34.540
 So what is sex?

47:34.540 --> 47:36.380
 Just asking for a friend.

47:36.380 --> 47:39.300
 And when was it invented and how hard was it to invent,

47:39.300 --> 47:42.340
 just as you were saying, and why was it invented?

47:42.340 --> 47:45.660
 Why, how hard was it and when?

47:45.660 --> 47:47.980
 I have a PhD student who's been working on this

47:47.980 --> 47:49.980
 and we've just published a couple of papers on sex.

47:49.980 --> 47:50.900
 Yes, yes, yes.

47:50.900 --> 47:51.740
 What do you publish?

47:51.740 --> 47:55.540
 Does biology, is it biology, genetics, journals?

47:55.540 --> 47:57.220
 This is actually PNAS,

47:57.220 --> 48:00.180
 which is Proceedings of the National Academy.

48:00.180 --> 48:02.420
 Broad, big, big picture stuff.

48:02.420 --> 48:03.500
 Everyone's interested in sex.

48:03.500 --> 48:04.340
 Yeah.

48:04.340 --> 48:07.940
 And the job of a biologist is to make sex dull.

48:07.940 --> 48:10.700
 Yes, yeah, that's a beautiful way to put it.

48:10.700 --> 48:13.220
 Okay, so when was it invented?

48:13.220 --> 48:16.940
 It was invented with eukaryotes about two billion years ago.

48:16.940 --> 48:20.900
 All eukaryotes share the same basic mechanism

48:20.900 --> 48:23.420
 that you produce gametes, the gametes fuse together.

48:23.420 --> 48:26.300
 So a gamete is the egg cell and the sperm.

48:26.300 --> 48:29.580
 They're not necessarily even different in size or shape.

48:29.580 --> 48:31.860
 So the simplest eukaryotes produce

48:31.860 --> 48:32.980
 what are called motile gametes.

48:32.980 --> 48:34.900
 They're all like sperm and they all swim around.

48:34.900 --> 48:36.420
 They find each other, they fuse together.

48:36.420 --> 48:39.940
 They don't have kind of much going on there beyond that.

48:39.940 --> 48:43.180
 And then these are haploid,

48:43.180 --> 48:46.100
 which is to say we all have two copies of our genome

48:46.100 --> 48:49.220
 and the gametes have only a single copy of the genome.

48:49.220 --> 48:51.980
 So when they fuse together, you now become diploid again,

48:51.980 --> 48:55.100
 which is to say you now have two copies of your genome.

48:55.100 --> 48:57.820
 And what you do is you line them all up

48:57.820 --> 49:01.620
 and then you double everything.

49:01.620 --> 49:03.900
 So now we have four copies of the complete genome.

49:03.900 --> 49:05.980
 And then we crisscross between all of these things.

49:05.980 --> 49:07.660
 So we take a bit from here and stick it on there

49:07.660 --> 49:09.620
 and a bit from here and we stick it on here.

49:09.620 --> 49:10.820
 That's recombination.

49:11.740 --> 49:14.820
 And then we go through two rounds of cell division.

49:14.820 --> 49:15.900
 So we divide in half.

49:15.900 --> 49:18.020
 So now the two daughter cells have two copies

49:18.020 --> 49:19.460
 and we divide in half again.

49:19.460 --> 49:21.220
 Now we have some gametes,

49:21.220 --> 49:24.460
 each of which has got a single copy of the genome.

49:24.460 --> 49:26.660
 And that's the basic ground plan

49:26.660 --> 49:29.780
 for what's called meiosis and Syngami.

49:29.780 --> 49:31.340
 That's basically sex.

49:31.340 --> 49:33.900
 And it happens at the level of single celled organisms.

49:33.900 --> 49:35.780
 And it happens pretty much the same way in plants

49:35.780 --> 49:38.140
 and pretty much the same way in animals and so on.

49:38.140 --> 49:40.220
 And it's not found in any bacteria.

49:40.220 --> 49:43.100
 They switch things around using the same machinery

49:43.100 --> 49:44.900
 and they take up a bit of DNA from the environment.

49:44.900 --> 49:46.620
 They take out this bit and stick in that bit

49:46.620 --> 49:50.020
 and it's the same molecular machinery they're using to do it.

49:50.020 --> 49:52.660
 So what about the kind of, you said, find each other,

49:52.660 --> 49:56.020
 this kind of imperative, find each other.

49:56.020 --> 49:57.300
 What is that?

49:57.300 --> 49:58.260
 Like, is that?

49:58.260 --> 50:00.660
 Well, you've got a few cells together.

50:00.660 --> 50:04.420
 So the bottom line on all of this is bacteria.

50:04.420 --> 50:07.820
 I mean, it's kind of simple when you've figured it out

50:07.820 --> 50:09.300
 and figuring it out, this is not me,

50:09.300 --> 50:11.700
 this is my PhD student, Marco Colnaghi.

50:13.020 --> 50:16.420
 And in effect, if you're doing lateral,

50:16.420 --> 50:19.740
 you're a Nicoli cell, you've got 4,000 genes.

50:19.740 --> 50:22.900
 You wanna scale up to a eukaryotic size.

50:22.900 --> 50:25.380
 I wanna have 20,000 genes.

50:25.380 --> 50:27.740
 And I need to maintain my genome

50:27.740 --> 50:30.460
 so it doesn't get shot to pieces by mutations.

50:30.460 --> 50:32.700
 And I'm gonna do it by lateral gene transfer.

50:32.700 --> 50:35.420
 So I know I've got a mutation in a gene.

50:35.420 --> 50:38.820
 I don't know which gene it is because I'm not sentient,

50:38.820 --> 50:40.220
 but I know I can't grow.

50:40.220 --> 50:42.460
 I know all my regulation systems are saying,

50:42.460 --> 50:44.980
 something wrong here, something wrong, pick up some DNA,

50:44.980 --> 50:47.700
 pick up a bit of DNA from the environment.

50:47.700 --> 50:49.060
 If you've got a small genome,

50:49.060 --> 50:50.980
 the chances of you picking up the right bit of DNA

50:50.980 --> 50:52.340
 from the environment is much higher

50:52.340 --> 50:54.780
 than if you've got a genome of 20,000 genes.

50:54.780 --> 50:58.060
 To do that, you've effectively got to be picking up DNA

50:58.060 --> 51:00.500
 all the time, all day long and nothing else.

51:00.500 --> 51:02.220
 And you're still gonna get the wrong DNA.

51:02.220 --> 51:03.720
 You've got to pick up large chunks.

51:03.720 --> 51:05.100
 And in the end, you've got to align them.

51:05.100 --> 51:08.920
 You're forced into sex, to coin a phrase.

51:10.220 --> 51:11.060
 So you're...

51:11.060 --> 51:12.540
 You're forced.

51:12.540 --> 51:17.540
 So there is a kind of incentive.

51:18.660 --> 51:20.100
 If you wanna have a large genome,

51:20.100 --> 51:22.620
 you've got to prevent it mutating to nothing.

51:22.620 --> 51:23.940
 That will happen with bacteria.

51:23.940 --> 51:25.640
 This is another reason why bacteria

51:25.640 --> 51:26.940
 can't have a large genome.

51:26.940 --> 51:28.660
 But as soon as you give them the power pack,

51:28.660 --> 51:30.340
 as soon as you give eukaryotic cells the power pack

51:30.340 --> 51:33.020
 that allows them to increase the size of their genome,

51:33.020 --> 51:34.380
 then you face the pressure

51:34.380 --> 51:36.300
 that you've got to maintain its quality.

51:36.300 --> 51:38.340
 You've got to stop it just mutating away.

51:38.340 --> 51:39.820
 What about sexual selection?

51:39.820 --> 51:44.740
 So the finding, like, I don't like this one.

51:44.740 --> 51:45.740
 I don't like this one.

51:45.740 --> 51:47.220
 This one seems all right.

51:47.220 --> 51:48.420
 Like, what's the...

51:49.820 --> 51:50.660
 Is it...

51:50.660 --> 51:52.740
 At which point does it become less random?

51:52.740 --> 51:54.140
 It's hard to know.

51:54.140 --> 51:56.020
 Because eukaryotes just kind of float around.

51:56.020 --> 51:57.020
 Just kind of have...

51:57.020 --> 51:59.060
 Yeah, I mean, is there sexual selection

51:59.060 --> 52:00.300
 in single celled eukaryotes?

52:00.300 --> 52:01.120
 There probably is.

52:01.120 --> 52:02.940
 It's just that I don't know very much about it.

52:02.940 --> 52:03.780
 By the time we get onto...

52:03.780 --> 52:05.700
 You don't hang out with the eukaryotes.

52:05.700 --> 52:07.380
 Well, I do all the time, but...

52:07.380 --> 52:09.020
 But you can't communicate with them yet.

52:09.020 --> 52:10.980
 Yeah, a peacock or something.

52:10.980 --> 52:11.820
 Yes.

52:12.780 --> 52:14.180
 The kind of standard answer,

52:14.180 --> 52:15.520
 this is not quite what I work on,

52:15.520 --> 52:19.780
 but the standard answer is that it's female mate choice.

52:19.780 --> 52:22.980
 She is looking for good genes.

52:22.980 --> 52:25.660
 And if you can have a tail that's like this

52:25.660 --> 52:28.100
 and still survive, still be alive,

52:28.100 --> 52:30.420
 not actually have been taken down by the nearest predator,

52:30.420 --> 52:31.780
 then you must've got pretty good genes

52:31.780 --> 52:36.460
 because despite this handicap, you're able to survive.

52:36.460 --> 52:38.340
 So those are like human interpretable things,

52:38.340 --> 52:39.220
 like with a peacock.

52:39.220 --> 52:43.020
 But I wonder, I'm sure echoes of the same thing

52:43.020 --> 52:46.540
 are there with more primitive organisms.

52:46.540 --> 52:51.220
 Basically your PR, like how you advertise yourself

52:51.220 --> 52:54.020
 that you're worthy of.

52:54.020 --> 52:54.860
 Absolutely.

52:54.860 --> 52:56.460
 So one big advertisement is the fact

52:56.460 --> 52:58.420
 that you survived it all.

52:58.420 --> 53:03.020
 Let me give you one beautiful example of an algal bloom.

53:03.020 --> 53:05.540
 And this can be a sign of bacteria.

53:05.540 --> 53:07.100
 It's gonna be in bacteria.

53:07.100 --> 53:10.780
 So if suddenly you pump nitrate or phosphate

53:10.780 --> 53:13.340
 or something into the ocean and everything goes green,

53:13.340 --> 53:17.020
 you end up with all this algae growing there.

53:18.180 --> 53:20.860
 A viral infection or something like that

53:20.860 --> 53:23.380
 can kill the entire bloom overnight.

53:23.380 --> 53:26.860
 And it's not that the virus takes out everything overnight.

53:26.860 --> 53:29.700
 It's that most of the cells in that bloom kill themselves

53:29.700 --> 53:31.900
 before the virus can get onto them.

53:31.900 --> 53:33.740
 And it's through a form of cell death

53:33.740 --> 53:35.020
 called programmed cell death.

53:35.020 --> 53:36.580
 And we do the same things.

53:36.580 --> 53:39.980
 It's how we have the gaps between our fingers and so on.

53:39.980 --> 53:43.060
 It's how we craft synapses in the brain.

53:43.060 --> 53:47.420
 It's fundamental again to multicellular life.

53:47.420 --> 53:51.220
 They have the same machinery in these algal blooms.

53:51.220 --> 53:52.900
 How do they know who dies?

53:52.900 --> 53:56.740
 The answer is they will often put out a toxin.

53:56.740 --> 54:00.300
 And that toxin is kind of a challenge to you.

54:00.300 --> 54:03.420
 Either you can cope with the toxin or you can't.

54:03.420 --> 54:06.460
 If you can cope with it, you form a spore

54:06.460 --> 54:09.100
 and you will go on to become the next generation.

54:09.100 --> 54:11.940
 You're forming kind of a resistance spore.

54:11.940 --> 54:14.180
 You sink down a little bit, you get out of the way,

54:14.180 --> 54:17.540
 you're out of the, you can't be attacked by a virus

54:17.540 --> 54:19.660
 if you're a spore or it's not so easily.

54:19.660 --> 54:21.900
 Whereas if you can't deal with that toxin,

54:21.900 --> 54:25.700
 you pull the plug and you trigger your death apparatus

54:25.700 --> 54:27.100
 and you kill yourself.

54:27.100 --> 54:29.140
 Oh, so it's truly life and death selection.

54:29.140 --> 54:31.620
 Yeah, so it's really, it's a challenge.

54:31.620 --> 54:33.620
 And this is a bit like sexual selection.

54:33.620 --> 54:36.940
 It's not so, they're all pretty much genetically identical,

54:36.940 --> 54:39.020
 but they've had different life histories.

54:39.020 --> 54:41.420
 So have you had a tough day?

54:41.420 --> 54:44.460
 Did you happen to get infected by this virus?

54:44.460 --> 54:45.540
 Or did you run out of iron?

54:45.540 --> 54:47.460
 Or did you get a bit too much sun?

54:47.460 --> 54:51.180
 Whatever it may be, if this extra stress of the toxin

54:51.180 --> 54:52.820
 just pushes you over the edge,

54:52.820 --> 54:53.980
 then you have this binary choice.

54:53.980 --> 54:55.180
 Either you're the next generation

54:55.180 --> 54:57.920
 or you kill yourself now using this same machinery.

54:57.920 --> 55:00.660
 It's also actually exactly the way I approach dating,

55:00.660 --> 55:03.220
 but that's probably why I'm single.

55:03.220 --> 55:07.360
 Okay, what about if we can step back, DNA?

55:07.360 --> 55:10.460
 Just mechanism of storing information.

55:10.460 --> 55:13.460
 RNA, DNA, how big of an invention was that?

55:13.460 --> 55:16.180
 That seems to be, that seems to be fundamental

55:16.180 --> 55:21.180
 to like something deep within what life is,

55:22.540 --> 55:24.060
 is the ability, as you said,

55:24.060 --> 55:28.000
 to kind of store and propagate information.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.900
 But then you also kind of infer that

55:29.900 --> 55:31.600
 with your and your students work,

55:31.600 --> 55:35.140
 that there's a deep connection between the chemistry

55:35.140 --> 55:39.060
 and the ability to have this kind of genetic information.

55:39.060 --> 55:41.140
 So how big of an invention is it

55:41.140 --> 55:43.740
 to have a nice representation,

55:43.740 --> 55:46.300
 nice hard drive for info to pass on?

55:46.300 --> 55:47.940
 Huge, I suspect.

55:47.940 --> 55:50.580
 I mean, but when I was talking about the code,

55:50.580 --> 55:52.600
 you see the code in RNA as well.

55:52.600 --> 55:55.040
 And RNA almost certainly came first.

55:56.100 --> 55:58.580
 And there's been an idea going back decades

55:58.580 --> 55:59.740
 called the RNA world,

55:59.740 --> 56:03.060
 because RNA in theory can copy itself

56:03.060 --> 56:04.900
 and can catalyze reactions.

56:04.900 --> 56:07.860
 So it kind of cuts out this chicken and egg loop.

56:07.860 --> 56:09.900
 So DNA as possible is not that special.

56:09.900 --> 56:13.560
 So RNA, RNA is the thing that does the work really.

56:13.560 --> 56:15.340
 And the code lies in RNA.

56:15.340 --> 56:16.900
 The code lies in the interactions

56:16.900 --> 56:18.340
 between RNA and amino acids.

56:18.340 --> 56:21.700
 And it still is there today in the ribosome, for example,

56:21.700 --> 56:23.820
 which is just kind of a giant ribozyme,

56:23.820 --> 56:26.500
 which is to say it's an enzyme that's made of RNA.

56:28.200 --> 56:33.200
 So getting to RNA, I suspect is probably not that hard,

56:34.180 --> 56:37.180
 but getting from RNA, how do you,

56:37.180 --> 56:39.860
 you know, there's multiple different types of RNA now.

56:39.860 --> 56:42.380
 How do you distinguish?

56:42.380 --> 56:43.860
 This is something we're actively thinking about.

56:43.860 --> 56:45.580
 How do you distinguish between,

56:45.580 --> 56:47.220
 you know, a random population of RNA?

56:47.220 --> 56:50.300
 Some of them go on to become messenger RNA.

56:50.300 --> 56:52.540
 This is the transcript of the code

56:52.540 --> 56:54.240
 of the gene that you want to make.

56:54.240 --> 56:56.860
 Some of them become transfer RNA,

56:56.860 --> 56:59.900
 which is kind of the unit that holds the amino acid

56:59.900 --> 57:01.720
 that's going to be polymerized.

57:01.720 --> 57:04.300
 Some of them become ribosomal RNA,

57:04.300 --> 57:07.540
 which is the machine which is joining them all up together.

57:07.540 --> 57:10.140
 How do they discriminate themselves?

57:10.140 --> 57:12.340
 And, you know, is some kind of phase transition

57:12.340 --> 57:13.180
 going on there?

57:13.180 --> 57:14.220
 I don't know.

57:14.220 --> 57:16.060
 It's a difficult question.

57:16.060 --> 57:18.300
 And we're now in the region of biology

57:18.300 --> 57:19.700
 where information is coming in.

57:19.700 --> 57:22.940
 But the thing about RNA is very, very good at what it does.

57:22.940 --> 57:25.620
 But the largest genome supported by RNA

57:25.620 --> 57:28.880
 are RNA viruses like HIV, for example.

57:28.880 --> 57:29.880
 They're pretty small.

57:29.880 --> 57:34.660
 And so there's a limit to how complex life could be

57:34.660 --> 57:36.380
 unless you come up with DNA,

57:36.380 --> 57:39.220
 which chemically is a really small change.

57:39.220 --> 57:41.780
 But how easy it is to make that change,

57:41.780 --> 57:42.620
 I don't really know.

57:42.620 --> 57:43.980
 As soon as you've got DNA,

57:43.980 --> 57:46.660
 then you've got an amazingly stable molecule

57:46.660 --> 57:48.440
 for information storage.

57:48.440 --> 57:50.580
 And you can do absolutely anything.

57:50.580 --> 57:53.260
 But how likely that transition from RNA to DNA was,

57:53.260 --> 57:54.460
 I don't know either.

57:54.460 --> 57:56.920
 How much possibility is there for variety

57:56.920 --> 58:00.440
 in ways to store information?

58:00.440 --> 58:01.480
 Because it seems to be very,

58:01.480 --> 58:03.040
 there's specific characteristics

58:03.040 --> 58:06.600
 about the programming language of DNA.

58:06.600 --> 58:08.320
 Yeah, there's a lot of work going on

58:08.320 --> 58:11.880
 on what's called the xenodNA or RNA.

58:11.880 --> 58:15.440
 Can we replace the bases themselves,

58:15.440 --> 58:18.320
 the letters, if you like, in RNA or DNA?

58:18.320 --> 58:19.880
 Can we replace the backbone?

58:19.880 --> 58:23.240
 Can we replace, for example, phosphate with arsenate?

58:23.240 --> 58:25.940
 Can we replace the sugar ribose or deoxyribose

58:25.940 --> 58:26.780
 with a different sugar?

58:26.780 --> 58:28.240
 And the answer is yes, you can.

58:29.880 --> 58:34.240
 Within limits, there's not an infinite space there.

58:34.240 --> 58:36.080
 Arsenate doesn't really work

58:36.080 --> 58:38.000
 if the bonds are not as strong as phosphate.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.300
 It's probably quite hard to replace phosphate.

58:42.360 --> 58:43.520
 It's possible to do it.

58:43.520 --> 58:47.560
 The question to me is why is it this way?

58:47.560 --> 58:50.300
 Is it because there was some form of selection

58:50.300 --> 58:52.160
 that this is better than the other forms

58:52.160 --> 58:53.720
 and there were lots of competing forms

58:53.720 --> 58:55.160
 of information storage early on

58:55.160 --> 58:56.840
 and this one was the one that worked out?

58:56.840 --> 58:58.520
 Or was it kind of channeled that way,

58:58.520 --> 59:01.960
 that these are the molecules that you're dealing with

59:01.960 --> 59:03.960
 and they work?

59:03.960 --> 59:05.840
 And I'm increasingly thinking it's that way,

59:05.840 --> 59:08.880
 that we're channeled towards ribose, phosphate,

59:08.880 --> 59:11.960
 and the bases that are used.

59:11.960 --> 59:14.560
 But there are 200 different letters

59:14.560 --> 59:17.160
 kicking around out there that could have been used.

59:17.160 --> 59:18.280
 It's such an interesting question.

59:18.280 --> 59:21.840
 If you look in the programming world in computer science,

59:21.840 --> 59:24.200
 there's a programming language called JavaScript,

59:24.200 --> 59:26.360
 which was written super quickly.

59:26.360 --> 59:29.440
 It's a giant mess, but it took over the world.

59:29.440 --> 59:30.280
 And it was kind of a...

59:30.280 --> 59:31.320
 Sounds very biological.

59:31.320 --> 59:35.080
 It was kind of a running joke that like,

59:35.080 --> 59:37.800
 like surely this can't be,

59:37.800 --> 59:39.560
 this is a terrible programming language.

59:39.560 --> 59:40.400
 It's a giant mess.

59:40.400 --> 59:41.760
 It's full of bugs.

59:41.760 --> 59:44.080
 It's so easy to write really crappy code,

59:44.080 --> 59:48.040
 but it took over all a front end development

59:48.040 --> 59:49.340
 in the web browser.

59:49.340 --> 59:52.280
 If you have any kind of dynamic interactive website,

59:52.280 --> 59:54.940
 it's usually running JavaScript.

59:54.940 --> 59:57.840
 And it's now taking over much of the backend,

59:57.840 --> 1:00:00.920
 which is like the serious heavy duty computational stuff.

1:00:00.920 --> 1:00:02.700
 And it's become super fast

1:00:02.700 --> 1:00:06.560
 with the different compilation engines that are running it.

1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:08.120
 So it's like, it really took over the world.

1:00:08.120 --> 1:00:13.120
 It's very possible that this initially crappy derided language

1:00:13.760 --> 1:00:14.880
 actually takes everything over.

1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:16.220
 And then the question is,

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:21.800
 did human civilization always strive towards JavaScript?

1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:25.160
 Or was JavaScript just the first programming language

1:00:25.160 --> 1:00:27.200
 that ran on the browser and still sticky?

1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:29.880
 The first is the sticky one.

1:00:29.880 --> 1:00:32.680
 And so it wins over anything else because it was first.

1:00:32.680 --> 1:00:34.640
 And I don't think that's answerable, right?

1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:37.160
 But it's good to ask that.

1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:38.920
 I suppose in the lab,

1:00:38.920 --> 1:00:43.400
 you can't run it with programming languages,

1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:47.440
 but in biology you can probably do some kind of

1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:52.440
 small scale evolutionary test to try to infer,

1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:54.760
 which is which.

1:00:54.760 --> 1:00:55.600
 Yeah.

1:00:55.600 --> 1:00:57.040
 I mean, in a way we've got the hardware

1:00:57.040 --> 1:00:58.640
 and the software here.

1:00:58.640 --> 1:01:02.880
 And the hardware is maybe the DNA and the RNA itself.

1:01:02.880 --> 1:01:06.200
 And then the software perhaps is more about the code.

1:01:06.200 --> 1:01:07.440
 Did the code have to be this way?

1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:09.360
 Could it have been a different way?

1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:11.440
 People talk about the optimization of the code

1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:14.040
 and there's some suggestion for that.

1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:16.080
 I think it's weak actually.

1:01:16.080 --> 1:01:17.560
 But you could imagine you could come out

1:01:17.560 --> 1:01:18.840
 with a million different codes

1:01:18.840 --> 1:01:20.840
 and this would be one of the best ones.

1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:24.320
 Well, we don't know this.

1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:27.400
 Well, I mean, people have tried to model it

1:01:27.400 --> 1:01:30.200
 based on the effect that mutations would have.

1:01:31.160 --> 1:01:32.040
 So no, you're right.

1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:34.120
 We don't know because that's a single assumption

1:01:34.120 --> 1:01:37.760
 that a mutation is what's being selected on there.

1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:39.320
 And there's other possibilities too.

1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:41.160
 I mean, there does seem to be a resilience

1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:43.200
 and a redundancy to the whole thing.

1:01:43.200 --> 1:01:47.640
 It's hard to mess up and the way you mess it up

1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:51.600
 often is likely to produce interesting results.

1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:52.760
 So it's...

1:01:52.760 --> 1:01:55.480
 Are you talking about JavaScript or the genetic code now?

1:01:55.480 --> 1:01:57.840
 Yeah, well, I mean, it's almost,

1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:00.640
 biology is underpinned by this kind of mess as well.

1:02:00.640 --> 1:02:03.400
 And you look at the human genome and it's full of stuff

1:02:03.400 --> 1:02:06.160
 that is really either broken or dysfunctional

1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:08.080
 or was a virus once, whatever it may be.

1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:09.280
 And somehow it works.

1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:11.640
 And maybe we need a lot of this mess.

1:02:11.640 --> 1:02:15.400
 We know that some functional genes are taken from this mess.

1:02:15.400 --> 1:02:19.560
 So what about, you mentioned the predatory behavior.

1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:20.400
 Yeah.

1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:21.440
 We talked about sex.

1:02:21.440 --> 1:02:24.720
 What about violence, predator and prey dynamics?

1:02:26.840 --> 1:02:28.520
 When was that invented?

1:02:29.600 --> 1:02:33.920
 And poetic and biological ways of putting it,

1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:37.400
 how do you describe predator prey relationship?

1:02:37.400 --> 1:02:41.800
 Is it a beautiful dance or is it a violent atrocity?

1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:44.360
 Well, I guess it's both, isn't it?

1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:45.360
 I mean, when does it start?

1:02:45.360 --> 1:02:46.920
 It starts in bacteria.

1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:49.280
 You see these amazing predators.

1:02:49.280 --> 1:02:51.640
 Della Vibrio is one that Lynn Margulis

1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:53.760
 used to talk about a lot.

1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:55.600
 It's got a kind of a drill piece

1:02:55.600 --> 1:02:57.240
 that drills through the wall

1:02:57.240 --> 1:02:58.720
 and the membrane of the bacterium.

1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:00.560
 And then it effectively eats the bacterium

1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:03.560
 from just inside the periplasmic space

1:03:03.560 --> 1:03:04.960
 and makes copies of itself that way.

1:03:04.960 --> 1:03:06.360
 So that's straight predation.

1:03:06.360 --> 1:03:08.360
 There are predators among bacteria.

1:03:08.360 --> 1:03:10.280
 So predation in that, sorry to interrupt,

1:03:10.280 --> 1:03:12.560
 means you murder somebody

1:03:12.560 --> 1:03:17.560
 and use their body as a resource in some way.

1:03:17.600 --> 1:03:18.440
 Yeah.

1:03:18.440 --> 1:03:21.440
 But it's not parasitic in that

1:03:21.440 --> 1:03:23.400
 you need them to be still alive.

1:03:23.400 --> 1:03:26.360
 No, no, I mean, predation is you kill them, really.

1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:27.200
 You murder.

1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:29.440
 Parasites, so you kind of live on them.

1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:34.080
 Okay, so, but it seems the predator is the really popular.

1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:39.080
 So what we see if we go back 560, 570 million years

1:03:42.080 --> 1:03:44.200
 before the Cambrian explosion,

1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:48.600
 there is what's known as the Ediacaran fauna,

1:03:48.600 --> 1:03:50.200
 or sometimes they call Vendobionts,

1:03:50.200 --> 1:03:51.760
 which is a lovely name.

1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:55.680
 And it's not obvious that they're animals at all.

1:03:55.680 --> 1:03:56.720
 They're stalked things.

1:03:56.720 --> 1:03:59.200
 They often have fronds that look a lot like leaves

1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:01.960
 with kind of fractal branching patterns on them.

1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:05.640
 And the thing is, they're found,

1:04:05.640 --> 1:04:09.480
 sometimes geologists can figure out the environment

1:04:09.480 --> 1:04:10.840
 that they were in and say,

1:04:10.840 --> 1:04:12.480
 this is more than 200 meters deep

1:04:12.480 --> 1:04:14.560
 because there's no sign of any waves.

1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:18.600
 There's no storm damage down here, this kind of thing.

1:04:18.600 --> 1:04:19.760
 They were more than 200 meters deep,

1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:21.800
 so they're definitely not photosynthetic.

1:04:21.800 --> 1:04:25.400
 These are animals and they're filter feeders.

1:04:25.400 --> 1:04:27.720
 And we know sponges and corals and things

1:04:27.720 --> 1:04:29.040
 are filter feeding animals.

1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:30.560
 They're stuck to the spot.

1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:32.920
 And little bits of carbon that come their way,

1:04:32.920 --> 1:04:35.320
 they filter it out and that's what they're eating.

1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:38.480
 So no predation involved in this,

1:04:38.480 --> 1:04:40.680
 beyond stuff just dies anyway.

1:04:40.680 --> 1:04:43.360
 And it feels like a very gentle, rather beautiful,

1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:45.720
 rather limited world, you might say.

1:04:45.720 --> 1:04:47.480
 There's not a lot going on there.

1:04:48.480 --> 1:04:51.720
 And something changes.

1:04:51.720 --> 1:04:53.920
 Oxygen definitely changes during this period.

1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:55.360
 Other things may have changed as well.

1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:58.280
 But the next thing you really see in the fossil record

1:04:58.280 --> 1:05:00.600
 is the Cambrian explosion.

1:05:00.600 --> 1:05:02.080
 And what do we see there?

1:05:02.080 --> 1:05:04.800
 We're now seeing animals that we would recognize.

1:05:04.800 --> 1:05:07.760
 They've got eyes, they've got claws, they've got shells.

1:05:07.760 --> 1:05:12.760
 They're plainly killing things or running away and hiding.

1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:18.680
 And so we've gone from a rather gentle but limited world

1:05:18.680 --> 1:05:23.080
 to a rather vicious, unpleasant world that we recognize

1:05:23.080 --> 1:05:27.520
 and which leads to kind of arms races,

1:05:27.520 --> 1:05:31.160
 evolutionary arms races, which again is something

1:05:31.160 --> 1:05:32.920
 that when we think about a nuclear arms race,

1:05:32.920 --> 1:05:34.880
 we think, Jesus, we don't want to go there.

1:05:34.880 --> 1:05:37.400
 It's not done anybody any good.

1:05:37.400 --> 1:05:40.160
 In some ways, maybe it does do good.

1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:42.760
 I don't want to make an argument for nuclear arms.

1:05:42.760 --> 1:05:47.760
 But predation as a mechanism forces organisms

1:05:48.400 --> 1:05:52.320
 to adapt to change to be better to escape or to kill.

1:05:52.320 --> 1:05:55.920
 If you need to eat, then you've got to eat.

1:05:55.920 --> 1:05:57.840
 And a cheetah's not going to run at that speed

1:05:57.840 --> 1:06:02.840
 unless it has to because the zebra is capable of escaping.

1:06:03.640 --> 1:06:07.840
 So it leads to much greater feats of evolution

1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:09.880
 than would ever have been possible without it.

1:06:09.880 --> 1:06:12.680
 And in the end, to a much more beautiful world.

1:06:12.680 --> 1:06:17.680
 And so it's not all bad by any means.

1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:19.320
 But the thing is you can't have this

1:06:19.320 --> 1:06:21.080
 if you don't have an oxygenated planet.

1:06:21.080 --> 1:06:24.120
 Because it's all in the end, it's about how much energy

1:06:24.120 --> 1:06:26.640
 can you extract from the food you eat.

1:06:26.640 --> 1:06:28.360
 And if you don't have an oxygenated planet,

1:06:28.360 --> 1:06:32.240
 you can get about 10% out, not much more than that.

1:06:32.240 --> 1:06:34.120
 And if you've got an oxygenated planet,

1:06:34.120 --> 1:06:35.960
 you can get about 40% out.

1:06:35.960 --> 1:06:37.040
 And that means you can have,

1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:40.440
 instead of having one or two trophic levels,

1:06:40.440 --> 1:06:42.760
 you can have five or six trophic levels.

1:06:42.760 --> 1:06:44.360
 And that means things can eat things

1:06:44.360 --> 1:06:45.720
 that eat other things and so on.

1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:48.920
 And you've gone to a level of ecological complexity,

1:06:48.920 --> 1:06:51.720
 which is completely impossible in the absence of oxygen.

1:06:51.720 --> 1:06:54.400
 This reminds me of the Hunter S. Thompson quote,

1:06:54.400 --> 1:06:56.840
 that for every moment of triumph,

1:06:56.840 --> 1:07:00.960
 for every instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled.

1:07:02.040 --> 1:07:05.120
 The history of life on Earth, unfortunately,

1:07:05.120 --> 1:07:09.000
 is that of violence.

1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:13.320
 Just the trillions and trillions of multi cell organisms

1:07:13.320 --> 1:07:17.040
 that were murdered in the struggle for survival.

1:07:17.040 --> 1:07:20.360
 It's a sorry statement, but yes, it's basically true.

1:07:20.360 --> 1:07:23.960
 And that somehow is a catalyst

1:07:23.960 --> 1:07:26.220
 from an evolutionary perspective for creativity,

1:07:26.220 --> 1:07:28.880
 for creating more and more complex organisms

1:07:28.880 --> 1:07:30.160
 that are better and better at surviving.

1:07:30.160 --> 1:07:32.080
 I mean, survival of the fittest,

1:07:32.080 --> 1:07:33.520
 if you just go back to that old phrase,

1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:36.280
 means death of the weakest.

1:07:36.280 --> 1:07:38.480
 Now, what's fit, what's weak,

1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:41.400
 these are terms that don't have much intrinsic meaning.

1:07:41.400 --> 1:07:45.280
 But the thing is, evolution only happens because of death.

1:07:45.280 --> 1:07:49.000
 One way to die is the constraints,

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.160
 the scarcity of the resources in the environment,

1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:56.280
 but that seems to be not nearly as good of a mechanism

1:07:56.280 --> 1:07:59.480
 for death than other creatures

1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:01.480
 roaming about in the environment.

1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:04.160
 When I say environment, I mean like the static environment,

1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:05.880
 but then there's the dynamic environment

1:08:05.880 --> 1:08:08.360
 of bigger things trying to eat you

1:08:08.360 --> 1:08:10.600
 and use you for your energy.

1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:13.280
 It forces you to come up with a solution

1:08:13.280 --> 1:08:16.920
 to your specific problem that is inventive

1:08:16.920 --> 1:08:18.800
 and is new and hasn't been done before.

1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:22.560
 And so it forces, I mean, literally change,

1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:26.000
 literally evolution on populations.

1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:27.400
 They have to become different.

1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:30.000
 And it's interesting that humans have channeled that

1:08:30.900 --> 1:08:34.220
 into more, I mean, I guess what humans are doing

1:08:34.220 --> 1:08:37.760
 is they're inventing more productive

1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:39.880
 and safe ways of doing that.

1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:41.520
 You know, this whole idea of morality

1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:43.360
 and all those kinds of things,

1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:47.240
 I think they ultimately lead to competition

1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:51.600
 versus violence, because I think violence

1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:56.560
 can have a cold, brutal, inefficient aspect to it.

1:08:56.560 --> 1:09:01.280
 But if you channel that into more controlled competition

1:09:01.280 --> 1:09:05.480
 in the space of ideas, in the space of approaches to life,

1:09:05.480 --> 1:09:10.280
 maybe you can be even more productive than evolution is.

1:09:10.280 --> 1:09:12.200
 Because evolution is very wasteful.

1:09:12.200 --> 1:09:14.680
 Like the amount of murder required

1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:16.600
 to really test a good idea,

1:09:16.600 --> 1:09:19.520
 genetically speaking, is just a lot.

1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:21.120
 Many, many, many generations.

1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:24.560
 Morally, we cannot base society

1:09:24.560 --> 1:09:26.280
 on the way that evolution works.

1:09:26.280 --> 1:09:27.280
 That's an invention, right?

1:09:27.280 --> 1:09:29.600
 But actually, in some respects we do,

1:09:29.600 --> 1:09:31.440
 which is to say, this is how science works.

1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:34.000
 We have competing hypotheses that have to get better,

1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:35.360
 otherwise they die.

1:09:35.360 --> 1:09:36.640
 It's the way that society works.

1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:41.040
 You know, in ancient Greece, we had the Athens

1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:42.520
 and Sparta and city states,

1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:45.360
 and then we had the Renaissance and nation states,

1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:48.400
 and universities compete with each other.

1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:50.560
 Tremendous amount of companies competing

1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:51.680
 with each other all the time.

1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:53.640
 It drives innovation.

1:09:55.080 --> 1:09:57.400
 And if we want to do it without all the death

1:09:57.400 --> 1:09:59.040
 that we see in nature,

1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:03.320
 then we have to have some kind of societal level control

1:10:03.320 --> 1:10:05.480
 that says, well, there's some limits, guys,

1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:07.240
 and these are what the limits are gonna be.

1:10:07.240 --> 1:10:08.760
 And society as a whole has to say,

1:10:08.760 --> 1:10:10.920
 right, we want to limit the amount of death here,

1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:12.720
 so you can't do this and you can't do that.

1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:14.280
 And you know, who makes up these rules,

1:10:14.280 --> 1:10:15.120
 and how do we know?

1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:16.960
 It's a tough thing, but it's basically

1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:19.440
 trying to find a moral basis

1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:22.960
 for avoiding the death of evolution and natural selection

1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:27.400
 and keeping the innovation and the richness of it.

1:10:27.400 --> 1:10:31.840
 And I forgot who said it, but that murder is illegal.

1:10:31.840 --> 1:10:33.200
 Probably Kurt Vonnegut.

1:10:33.200 --> 1:10:35.440
 Murder is illegal except when it's done

1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:38.240
 to the sound of trumpets and at a large scale.

1:10:38.240 --> 1:10:40.600
 So we still have wars.

1:10:41.720 --> 1:10:44.160
 But we are struggling with this idea

1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:47.280
 that murder is a bad thing.

1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:49.760
 It's so interesting how we're channeling

1:10:49.760 --> 1:10:53.240
 the best of the evolutionary imperative

1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:58.240
 and trying to get rid of the stuff that's not productive.

1:10:58.360 --> 1:11:00.600
 Trying to almost accelerate evolution.

1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:05.600
 The same kind of thing that makes evolution creative.

1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:07.360
 We're trying to use that.

1:11:07.360 --> 1:11:08.640
 I think we naturally do it.

1:11:08.640 --> 1:11:10.640
 I mean, I don't think we can help ourselves do it.

1:11:10.640 --> 1:11:13.280
 And you know, capitalism as a form

1:11:13.280 --> 1:11:17.200
 is basically about competition and differential rewards.

1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:21.720
 But we, society, and you know, we have a,

1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:25.200
 I keep using this word moral obligation,

1:11:25.200 --> 1:11:28.680
 but you know, we cannot operate as a society

1:11:28.680 --> 1:11:29.800
 if we go that way.

1:11:29.800 --> 1:11:34.800
 It's interesting that we've had problems achieving balance.

1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:39.320
 So for example, in the financial crash in 2009,

1:11:39.320 --> 1:11:41.240
 do you let banks go to the wall or not?

1:11:41.240 --> 1:11:42.960
 This kind of question.

1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:45.040
 In evolution, certainly you let them go to the wall.

1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:47.840
 And in that sense, you don't need the regulation

1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:49.560
 because they just die.

1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:53.840
 Whereas if we, as a society,

1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:56.320
 think about what's required for society as a whole,

1:11:56.320 --> 1:11:59.440
 then you don't necessarily let them go to the wall.

1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:01.480
 In which case you then have to impose

1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:05.440
 some kind of regulation that the bankers themselves will,

1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:07.240
 in an evolutionary manner, exploit.

1:12:08.160 --> 1:12:11.360
 Yeah, we've been struggling with this kind of idea

1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:16.120
 of capitalism, the cold brutality of capitalism

1:12:16.120 --> 1:12:18.920
 that seems to create so much beautiful things

1:12:18.920 --> 1:12:20.320
 in this world.

1:12:20.320 --> 1:12:23.200
 And then the ideals of communism

1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:26.640
 that seem to create so much brutal destruction in history.

1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:28.720
 We struggle with ideas of,

1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:30.560
 well, maybe we didn't do it right.

1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:31.760
 How can we do things better?

1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:33.480
 And then the ideas are the things

1:12:33.480 --> 1:12:35.960
 where we're playing with as opposed to people.

1:12:35.960 --> 1:12:37.720
 If a PhD student has a bad idea,

1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:39.600
 we don't shoot the PhD student.

1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:42.080
 We just criticize their idea and hope they improve.

1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:44.040
 You have a very humane lab.

1:12:44.040 --> 1:12:46.560
 Yeah, I don't know how you guys do it.

1:12:46.560 --> 1:12:49.360
 The way I run things, it's always life and death.

1:12:49.360 --> 1:12:52.480
 Okay, so it is interesting about humans

1:12:52.480 --> 1:12:54.760
 that there is an inner sense of morality

1:12:54.760 --> 1:12:59.760
 which begs the question of how did homo sapiens evolve?

1:13:02.440 --> 1:13:04.320
 If we think about the invention of,

1:13:05.560 --> 1:13:09.200
 early invention of sex and early invention of predation,

1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:15.440
 what was the thing invented to make humans?

1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:17.160
 What would you say?

1:13:17.160 --> 1:13:19.120
 I mean, I suppose a couple of things I'd say.

1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:21.360
 Number one is you don't have to wind the clock back

1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:24.160
 very far, five, six million years or so,

1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:26.640
 and let it run forwards again.

1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:29.000
 And the chances of humans as we know them

1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.040
 is not necessarily that high.

1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:34.560
 You know, imagine as an alien, you find planet Earth

1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:36.280
 and it's got everything apart from humans on it.

1:13:36.280 --> 1:13:39.360
 It's an amazing, wonderful, marvelous planet,

1:13:39.360 --> 1:13:41.320
 but nothing that we would recognize

1:13:41.320 --> 1:13:43.640
 as extremely intelligent life,

1:13:43.640 --> 1:13:45.840
 kind of space faring civilization.

1:13:45.840 --> 1:13:46.960
 So when we think about aliens,

1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:49.760
 we're kind of after something like ourselves.

1:13:49.760 --> 1:13:51.800
 We're after a space faring civilization.

1:13:51.800 --> 1:13:55.840
 We're not after zebras and giraffes and lions and things,

1:13:55.840 --> 1:13:57.720
 amazing though they are.

1:13:57.720 --> 1:14:01.280
 But the additional kind of evolutionary steps

1:14:01.280 --> 1:14:06.120
 to go from large, complex mammals, monkeys, let's say,

1:14:06.120 --> 1:14:11.120
 to humans doesn't strike me as that long a distance.

1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:14.440
 It's all about the brain.

1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:17.040
 And where's the brain and morality coming from?

1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:19.880
 It seems to me to be all about groups,

1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:22.440
 human groups and interactions between groups.

1:14:22.440 --> 1:14:24.480
 The collective intelligence of it.

1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:26.680
 Yes, the interactions really.

1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:30.080
 And there's a guy at UCL called Mark Thomas,

1:14:30.080 --> 1:14:32.000
 who's done a lot of really beautiful work,

1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:33.560
 I think, on this kind of question.

1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:34.920
 So I talk to him every now and then,

1:14:34.920 --> 1:14:37.240
 so my views are influenced by him.

1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:43.080
 But a lot seems to depend on population density,

1:14:43.080 --> 1:14:45.520
 that the more interactions you have going on

1:14:45.520 --> 1:14:49.200
 between different groups, the more transfer of information,

1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:51.040
 if you like, between groups,

1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:53.600
 people moving from one group to another group,

1:14:53.600 --> 1:14:56.000
 almost like lateral gene transfer in bacteria,

1:14:57.160 --> 1:15:01.000
 the more expertise you're able to develop and maintain,

1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:04.480
 the more culturally complex your society can become.

1:15:04.480 --> 1:15:06.720
 And groups that have become detached,

1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:09.240
 like on Easter Island, for example,

1:15:09.240 --> 1:15:12.480
 very often degenerate in terms of the complexity

1:15:12.480 --> 1:15:13.560
 of their civilization.

1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:16.080
 Is that true for complex organisms in general?

1:15:16.080 --> 1:15:19.160
 Population density is often productive.

1:15:19.160 --> 1:15:21.120
 Really matters, but in human terms,

1:15:23.080 --> 1:15:26.000
 I don't know what the actual factors were

1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:28.600
 that were driving a large brain,

1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:32.880
 but you can talk about fire, you can talk about tool use,

1:15:32.880 --> 1:15:34.120
 you can talk about language,

1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:36.720
 and none of them seem to correlate especially well

1:15:36.720 --> 1:15:39.480
 with the actual known trajectory of human evolution

1:15:39.480 --> 1:15:42.760
 in terms of cave art and these kind of things.

1:15:42.760 --> 1:15:45.080
 That seems to work much better

1:15:45.080 --> 1:15:47.520
 just with population density

1:15:47.520 --> 1:15:51.200
 and number of interactions between different groups,

1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:55.840
 all of which is really about human interactions,

1:15:55.840 --> 1:15:58.600
 human human interactions and the complexity of those.

1:15:58.600 --> 1:16:02.040
 But population density is the thing

1:16:02.040 --> 1:16:04.280
 that increases the number of interactions,

1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:06.640
 but then there must have been inventions

1:16:09.280 --> 1:16:12.920
 forced by that number of interactions

1:16:12.920 --> 1:16:14.680
 that actually led to humans.

1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:18.600
 So like Richard Wrangham talks about that

1:16:18.600 --> 1:16:22.040
 it's basically the beta males had to beat up the alpha male.

1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:23.760
 So that's what collaboration looks like,

1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:26.000
 is they, when you're living together,

1:16:28.480 --> 1:16:33.480
 our early ancestors don't like the dictatorial aspect

1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:36.040
 of a single individual at the top of a tribe.

1:16:36.040 --> 1:16:38.520
 So they learned to collaborate

1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:42.800
 how to basically create a democracy of sorts,

1:16:42.800 --> 1:16:45.200
 a democracy that prevents, minimizes,

1:16:45.200 --> 1:16:47.320
 or lessens the amount of violence,

1:16:47.320 --> 1:16:50.640
 which essentially gives strength to the tribe

1:16:50.640 --> 1:16:55.040
 and make the war between tribes versus the dictator.

1:16:55.040 --> 1:16:57.280
 I mean, I think one of the most wonderful things

1:16:57.280 --> 1:17:00.360
 about humans is we're all of those things.

1:17:00.360 --> 1:17:03.720
 I mean, we are deeply social as a species

1:17:03.720 --> 1:17:05.360
 and we're also deeply selfish.

1:17:05.360 --> 1:17:06.440
 And it seems to me the conflict

1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:08.400
 between capitalism and communism,

1:17:08.400 --> 1:17:10.400
 it's really just two aspects of human nature,

1:17:10.400 --> 1:17:11.240
 both of which are.

1:17:11.240 --> 1:17:15.120
 We have both and we have a constant kind of vying

1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:16.080
 between the two sides.

1:17:16.080 --> 1:17:19.440
 We really do care about other people beyond our families,

1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:21.120
 beyond our immediate people.

1:17:21.120 --> 1:17:24.600
 We care about society and the society that we live in.

1:17:24.600 --> 1:17:27.120
 And you could say that's a drawing

1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:28.520
 towards socialism or communism.

1:17:28.520 --> 1:17:30.720
 On the other side, we really do care about ourselves.

1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:32.120
 We really do care about our families,

1:17:32.120 --> 1:17:34.760
 about working for something that we gain from.

1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:35.960
 And that's the capitalist side of it.

1:17:35.960 --> 1:17:38.880
 They're both really deeply ingrained in human nature.

1:17:38.880 --> 1:17:43.040
 In terms of violence and interactions between groups,

1:17:43.040 --> 1:17:45.960
 yes, all this dynamic of,

1:17:45.960 --> 1:17:47.160
 if you're interacting between groups,

1:17:47.160 --> 1:17:50.240
 you can be certain that they're gonna be burning each other

1:17:50.240 --> 1:17:53.360
 and all kinds of physical violent interactions as well,

1:17:53.360 --> 1:17:56.600
 which will drive the kind of cleverness

1:17:56.600 --> 1:17:57.840
 of how do you resist this?

1:17:57.840 --> 1:17:59.360
 Let's build a tower.

1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:02.640
 What are we gonna do to prevent being overrun

1:18:02.640 --> 1:18:05.080
 by those marauding gangs from over there?

1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:08.280
 And you look outside humans

1:18:08.280 --> 1:18:10.640
 and you look at chimps and bonobos and so on,

1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:13.280
 and they're very, very different structures to society.

1:18:13.280 --> 1:18:16.640
 Chimps tend to have an aggressive alpha male type structure

1:18:16.640 --> 1:18:21.000
 and bonobos, there's basically a female society

1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:22.880
 where the males are predominantly excluded

1:18:22.880 --> 1:18:25.600
 and only brought in at the behest of the female.

1:18:25.600 --> 1:18:29.280
 We have a lot in common with both of those groups.

1:18:29.280 --> 1:18:31.080
 And there's, again, tension there.

1:18:31.080 --> 1:18:33.360
 And probably chimps, more violence,

1:18:33.360 --> 1:18:35.440
 the bonobos, probably more sex.

1:18:35.440 --> 1:18:36.760
 That's another tension.

1:18:36.760 --> 1:18:41.760
 How serious do we wanna be?

1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:44.160
 How much fun we wanna be?

1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:45.960
 Asking for a friend again,

1:18:45.960 --> 1:18:47.920
 what do you think happened to Neanderthals?

1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:52.000
 What did we cheeky humans do to the Neanderthals,

1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:53.040
 Homo sapiens?

1:18:53.040 --> 1:18:54.320
 Do you think we murdered them?

1:18:54.320 --> 1:18:56.760
 Was it, how do we murder them?

1:18:56.760 --> 1:18:58.180
 How do we outcompete them?

1:18:59.360 --> 1:19:01.240
 Or do we mate them?

1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:02.120
 I don't know.

1:19:02.120 --> 1:19:04.400
 I mean, I think there's unequivocal evidence

1:19:04.400 --> 1:19:05.980
 that we mated with them.

1:19:05.980 --> 1:19:07.720
 We always try to mate with everything.

1:19:07.720 --> 1:19:09.460
 Yes, pretty much.

1:19:09.460 --> 1:19:10.320
 There's some interesting,

1:19:10.320 --> 1:19:12.060
 the first sequences that came along

1:19:12.060 --> 1:19:14.060
 were in mitochondrial DNA.

1:19:14.060 --> 1:19:17.160
 And that was back to about 2002 or thereabouts.

1:19:18.520 --> 1:19:21.240
 What was found was that Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA

1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:23.360
 was very different to human mitochondria.

1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:24.200
 Oh, that's so interesting.

1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:25.040
 You could do a clock on it

1:19:25.040 --> 1:19:26.600
 and it said the divergent state

1:19:26.600 --> 1:19:29.200
 was about 600,000 years ago or something like that.

1:19:29.200 --> 1:19:31.040
 So not so long ago.

1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:33.960
 And then the first full genomes were sequenced

1:19:33.960 --> 1:19:36.240
 maybe 10 years after that.

1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:39.600
 And they showed plenty of signs of mating between.

1:19:39.600 --> 1:19:43.080
 So the mitochondrial DNA effectively says no mating.

1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:47.920
 And the nuclear genes say, yeah, lots of mating.

1:19:47.920 --> 1:19:48.740
 But we don't know.

1:19:48.740 --> 1:19:49.580
 How's that possible?

1:19:49.580 --> 1:19:50.400
 So can you explain the difference

1:19:50.400 --> 1:19:53.840
 between mitochondrial DNA and nucleus?

1:19:53.840 --> 1:19:55.580
 I've talked before about the mitochondria,

1:19:55.580 --> 1:19:57.400
 which are the power packs in cells.

1:19:57.400 --> 1:20:01.400
 These are the paired down control units is their DNA.

1:20:01.400 --> 1:20:03.940
 So it's passed on by the mother only.

1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:07.140
 And in the egg cell,

1:20:07.140 --> 1:20:10.600
 we might have half a million copies of mitochondrial DNA.

1:20:10.600 --> 1:20:15.080
 There's only 37 genes left and they do a,

1:20:15.080 --> 1:20:17.200
 it's basically the control unit of energy production.

1:20:17.200 --> 1:20:18.480
 That's what it's doing.

1:20:18.480 --> 1:20:21.720
 It's a basic old school machine that does.

1:20:21.720 --> 1:20:23.300
 And it's got genes that were considered

1:20:23.300 --> 1:20:24.880
 to be effectively trivial

1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:28.740
 because they did a very narrowly defined job,

1:20:28.740 --> 1:20:30.360
 but they're not trivial in the sense

1:20:30.360 --> 1:20:31.640
 that that narrowly defined job

1:20:31.640 --> 1:20:34.620
 is about everything that is being alive.

1:20:35.800 --> 1:20:38.160
 So they're much easier to sequence.

1:20:38.160 --> 1:20:39.760
 You've got many more copies of these things

1:20:39.760 --> 1:20:42.120
 and you can sequence them very quickly.

1:20:42.120 --> 1:20:43.800
 But the problem is because they go down

1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:46.320
 only the maternal line from mother to daughter,

1:20:46.320 --> 1:20:49.560
 your mitochondrial DNA and mine is going nowhere.

1:20:49.560 --> 1:20:50.960
 It doesn't matter.

1:20:50.960 --> 1:20:53.840
 Any kids we have, they get their mother's mitochondrial DNA

1:20:53.840 --> 1:20:59.520
 except in very, very rare and strange circumstances.

1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:02.280
 And so it tells a different story

1:21:02.280 --> 1:21:06.280
 and it's not a story which is easy to reconcile always.

1:21:06.280 --> 1:21:10.040
 And what it seems to suggest to my mind at least

1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:13.840
 is that there was one way traffic of genes

1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:16.520
 probably going from humans into Neanderthals

1:21:16.520 --> 1:21:18.040
 rather than the other way around.

1:21:18.040 --> 1:21:19.800
 Why did the Neanderthals disappear?

1:21:19.800 --> 1:21:20.800
 I don't know.

1:21:20.800 --> 1:21:23.640
 I mean, I suspect that they were,

1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:25.600
 I suspect they were probably less violent,

1:21:25.600 --> 1:21:31.560
 less clever, less populous, less willing to fight.

1:21:31.560 --> 1:21:32.520
 I don't know.

1:21:32.520 --> 1:21:34.760
 I mean, I think it probably drove them to extinction

1:21:34.760 --> 1:21:35.960
 at the margins of Europe.

1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:39.080
 And it's interesting how much,

1:21:39.080 --> 1:21:41.440
 if we ran Earth over and over again,

1:21:41.440 --> 1:21:45.360
 how many of these branches of intelligent beings

1:21:45.360 --> 1:21:47.600
 that have figured out some kind of

1:21:49.640 --> 1:21:52.560
 how to leverage collective intelligence,

1:21:52.560 --> 1:21:53.760
 which ones of them emerge?

1:21:53.760 --> 1:21:55.640
 Which ones of them succeed?

1:21:55.640 --> 1:21:57.760
 Is it the more violent ones?

1:21:57.760 --> 1:22:01.320
 Is it the more isolated ones?

1:22:01.320 --> 1:22:03.760
 Like what dynamics result in more productivity?

1:22:03.760 --> 1:22:06.400
 And I suppose we'll never know.

1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:07.840
 The more complex the organism,

1:22:07.840 --> 1:22:10.600
 the harder it is to run the experiment in the lab.

1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:12.120
 Yes.

1:22:12.120 --> 1:22:15.160
 And in some respects, maybe it's best if we don't know.

1:22:15.160 --> 1:22:16.000
 Yeah.

1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:18.120
 The truth might be very painful.

1:22:18.120 --> 1:22:20.640
 What about if we actually step back

1:22:20.640 --> 1:22:23.040
 a couple of interesting things that we humans do?

1:22:24.920 --> 1:22:28.840
 One is object manipulation and movement.

1:22:28.840 --> 1:22:32.080
 And of course, movement was something that was done,

1:22:32.080 --> 1:22:33.760
 that was another big invention,

1:22:33.760 --> 1:22:36.080
 being able to move around the environment.

1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:39.400
 And the other one is this sensory mechanism,

1:22:39.400 --> 1:22:41.040
 how we sense the environment.

1:22:41.040 --> 1:22:44.000
 One of the coolest high definition ones is vision.

1:22:45.320 --> 1:22:47.120
 How big are those inventions

1:22:47.120 --> 1:22:50.840
 in the history of life on Earth?

1:22:50.840 --> 1:22:55.040
 Vision, movement, I mean, again, extremely important,

1:22:55.040 --> 1:22:56.760
 going back to the origin of animals,

1:22:56.760 --> 1:22:59.560
 the Cambrian explosion where suddenly you're seeing eyes

1:22:59.560 --> 1:23:01.080
 in the fossil record.

1:23:01.080 --> 1:23:03.720
 And you can, it's not necessarily, again,

1:23:03.720 --> 1:23:05.800
 lots of people historically have said

1:23:05.800 --> 1:23:06.920
 what use is half an eye?

1:23:06.920 --> 1:23:10.640
 And you can go in a series of steps

1:23:10.640 --> 1:23:15.640
 from a light sensitive spot on a flat piece of tissue

1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:20.360
 to an eyeball with a lens and so on.

1:23:20.360 --> 1:23:23.080
 If you assume no more than, I don't remember,

1:23:23.080 --> 1:23:25.120
 this was a specific model that I have in mind,

1:23:25.120 --> 1:23:28.480
 but it was 1% change or half a percent change

1:23:28.480 --> 1:23:29.440
 for each generation.

1:23:29.440 --> 1:23:31.560
 How long would it take to evolve an eye as we know it?

1:23:31.560 --> 1:23:34.000
 And the answer is half a million years.

1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:35.560
 It doesn't have to take long.

1:23:35.560 --> 1:23:36.840
 That's not how evolution works.

1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:38.640
 That's not an answer to the question.

1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:41.680
 It just shows you can reconstruct the steps

1:23:41.680 --> 1:23:44.600
 and you can work out roughly how it can work.

1:23:44.600 --> 1:23:48.280
 So it's not that big a deal to evolve an eye,

1:23:49.280 --> 1:23:51.960
 but once you have one, then there's nowhere to hide.

1:23:51.960 --> 1:23:55.120
 And again, we're back to predator prey relationships.

1:23:55.120 --> 1:23:56.360
 We're back to all the benefits

1:23:56.360 --> 1:23:58.320
 that being able to see brings you.

1:23:58.320 --> 1:24:00.760
 And if you think philosophically what bats are doing

1:24:00.760 --> 1:24:04.240
 with eco location and so on, I have no idea,

1:24:04.240 --> 1:24:06.440
 but I suspect that they form an image of the world

1:24:06.440 --> 1:24:07.960
 in pretty much the same way that we do.

1:24:07.960 --> 1:24:10.160
 It's just a matter of mental reconstruction.

1:24:10.160 --> 1:24:11.880
 So I suppose the other thing about sight,

1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:16.880
 there are single celled organisms that have got a lens

1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:21.600
 and a retina and a cornea and so on.

1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:24.840
 Basically they've got a camera type eye in a single cell.

1:24:24.840 --> 1:24:26.000
 They don't have a brain.

1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:29.680
 What they understand about their world

1:24:29.680 --> 1:24:32.680
 is impossible to say, but they're capable of coming up

1:24:32.680 --> 1:24:34.960
 with the same structures to do so.

1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:39.160
 So I suppose then is that once you've got things like eyes,

1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:41.100
 then you have a big driving pressure

1:24:41.100 --> 1:24:42.440
 on the central nervous system

1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:44.480
 to figure out what it all means.

1:24:44.480 --> 1:24:45.720
 And then we come around to your other point

1:24:45.720 --> 1:24:48.000
 about manipulation, sensory input, and so on

1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:52.800
 about now you have a huge requirement

1:24:52.800 --> 1:24:55.080
 to understand what your environment is and what it means

1:24:55.080 --> 1:24:57.120
 and how it reacts and how you should run away

1:24:57.120 --> 1:24:59.200
 and where you should stay put.

1:24:59.200 --> 1:25:00.480
 Actually on that point, let me,

1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:03.800
 I don't know if you know the work of Donald Hoffman,

1:25:03.800 --> 1:25:08.800
 who uses the argument, the mechanism of evolution

1:25:11.640 --> 1:25:14.800
 to say that there's not necessarily

1:25:14.800 --> 1:25:19.800
 a strong evolutionary value to seeing the world as it is.

1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:26.880
 So objective reality, that our perception actually

1:25:26.880 --> 1:25:29.840
 is very different from what's objectively real.

1:25:29.840 --> 1:25:32.240
 We're living inside an illusion

1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:37.240
 and we're basically the entire set of species on earth,

1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:40.200
 I think, I guess, are competing in a space

1:25:40.200 --> 1:25:41.980
 that's an illusion that's distinct from,

1:25:41.980 --> 1:25:45.360
 that's far away from physical reality as it is,

1:25:45.360 --> 1:25:46.280
 as defined by physics.

1:25:46.280 --> 1:25:48.720
 I'm not sure it's an illusion so much as a bubble.

1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:50.520
 I mean, we have a sensory input,

1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:51.960
 which is a fraction of what we could have

1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:55.280
 a sensory input on, and we interpret it

1:25:55.280 --> 1:25:58.240
 in terms of what's useful for us to know to stay alive.

1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:00.720
 So yes, it's an illusion in that sense,

1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:03.640
 but the tree is physically there.

1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:06.320
 And if you walk into that tree, you know,

1:26:06.320 --> 1:26:08.240
 that there is, it's not purely a delusion,

1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:10.360
 there's some physical reality to it.

1:26:10.360 --> 1:26:15.140
 So it's a sensory slice into reality as it is,

1:26:15.140 --> 1:26:17.160
 but because it's just a slice,

1:26:17.160 --> 1:26:18.840
 you're missing a big picture.

1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:21.400
 But he says that that slice doesn't necessarily

1:26:21.400 --> 1:26:23.080
 need to be a slice.

1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:25.800
 It could be a complete fabrication

1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:28.440
 that's just consistent amongst the species,

1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:31.640
 which is an interesting, or at least it's a humbling

1:26:32.780 --> 1:26:37.160
 realization that our perception is limited

1:26:37.160 --> 1:26:40.520
 and our cognitive abilities are limited.

1:26:40.520 --> 1:26:44.920
 And at least to me, it's argument from evolution,

1:26:44.920 --> 1:26:49.380
 I don't know how much, how strong that is as an argument,

1:26:49.380 --> 1:26:54.380
 but I do think that life can exist in the mind.

1:26:54.380 --> 1:26:59.380
 In the same way that you can do a virtual reality video game

1:26:59.580 --> 1:27:02.300
 and you can have a vibrant life inside that place

1:27:02.300 --> 1:27:05.860
 and that place is not real in some sense,

1:27:05.860 --> 1:27:07.180
 but you could still have a vibrant,

1:27:07.180 --> 1:27:08.860
 all the same forces of evolution,

1:27:08.860 --> 1:27:12.860
 all the same competition, the dynamics of between humans

1:27:12.860 --> 1:27:17.120
 you can have, but I don't know if,

1:27:19.500 --> 1:27:21.980
 I don't know if there's evidence for that being

1:27:21.980 --> 1:27:23.660
 the thing that happened on earth.

1:27:23.660 --> 1:27:25.100
 It seems that earth.

1:27:25.100 --> 1:27:27.100
 I think in either environment, I wouldn't deny

1:27:27.100 --> 1:27:29.820
 that you could have exactly the world that you talk about

1:27:29.820 --> 1:27:31.860
 and it would be very difficult to,

1:27:33.420 --> 1:27:36.540
 the idea in matrix movies and so on

1:27:36.540 --> 1:27:40.300
 that the whole world is completely a construction

1:27:42.180 --> 1:27:43.900
 and we're fundamentally deluded.

1:27:43.900 --> 1:27:47.260
 It's difficult to say that's impossible or couldn't happen

1:27:47.260 --> 1:27:51.160
 or, and certainly we construct in our minds

1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:53.220
 what the outside world is, but we do it on input

1:27:53.220 --> 1:27:56.820
 and that input, I would hesitate to say it's not real

1:27:57.780 --> 1:28:00.340
 because it's precisely how we do understand the world.

1:28:00.340 --> 1:28:04.100
 We have eyes, but if you keep someone in,

1:28:04.100 --> 1:28:06.060
 apparently this kind of thing happens,

1:28:06.060 --> 1:28:08.560
 someone kept in a dark room for five years

1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:10.940
 or something like that, they never see properly again

1:28:10.940 --> 1:28:15.220
 because the neural wiring that underpins

1:28:15.220 --> 1:28:18.840
 how we interpret vision never developed.

1:28:18.840 --> 1:28:21.260
 You need, when you watch a child develop,

1:28:21.260 --> 1:28:23.780
 it walks into a table, it bangs his head on the table

1:28:23.780 --> 1:28:28.100
 and it hurts and now you've got two inputs.

1:28:28.100 --> 1:28:30.060
 You've got one pain from this sharp edge

1:28:30.060 --> 1:28:32.300
 and number two, you probably, you've touched it

1:28:32.300 --> 1:28:33.900
 and realized it's there, it's a sharp edge

1:28:33.900 --> 1:28:34.940
 and you've got the visual input

1:28:34.940 --> 1:28:36.500
 and you put the three things together and think,

1:28:36.500 --> 1:28:38.360
 I don't wanna walk into a table again.

1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:42.420
 So you're learning and it's a limited reality,

1:28:42.420 --> 1:28:44.260
 but it's a true reality and if you don't learn

1:28:44.260 --> 1:28:45.740
 that properly, then you will get eaten,

1:28:45.740 --> 1:28:48.740
 you will get hit by a bus, you will not survive.

1:28:48.740 --> 1:28:52.160
 And same, if you're in some kind of,

1:28:53.420 --> 1:28:55.940
 let's say, computer construction of reality,

1:28:55.940 --> 1:28:59.180
 I'm not in my ground here, but if you construct the laws

1:28:59.180 --> 1:29:03.620
 that this is what reality is inside this,

1:29:03.620 --> 1:29:05.180
 then you play by those laws.

1:29:05.180 --> 1:29:07.580
 Yeah, I mean, as long as the laws are consistent.

1:29:07.580 --> 1:29:09.620
 So just like you said in the lab,

1:29:09.620 --> 1:29:12.540
 the interesting thing about the simulation question,

1:29:12.540 --> 1:29:15.480
 yes, it's hard to know if we're living inside a simulation,

1:29:15.480 --> 1:29:18.580
 but also, yes, it's possible to do these kinds

1:29:18.580 --> 1:29:21.700
 of experiments in the lab now more and more.

1:29:21.700 --> 1:29:23.740
 To me, the interesting question is,

1:29:23.740 --> 1:29:28.140
 how realistic does a virtual reality game need to be

1:29:28.140 --> 1:29:30.620
 for us to not be able to tell the difference?

1:29:30.620 --> 1:29:33.300
 A more interesting question to me is,

1:29:33.300 --> 1:29:38.300
 how realistic or interesting

1:29:38.460 --> 1:29:40.660
 does a virtual reality world need to be

1:29:40.660 --> 1:29:43.460
 in order for us to want to stay there forever

1:29:43.460 --> 1:29:47.900
 or much longer than physical reality, prefer that place?

1:29:47.900 --> 1:29:52.140
 And also prefer it not as we prefer hard drugs,

1:29:52.140 --> 1:29:55.100
 but prefer it in a deep, meaningful way

1:29:55.100 --> 1:29:57.820
 in the way we enjoy life.

1:29:57.820 --> 1:30:00.460
 I mean, I suppose the issue with the matrix,

1:30:00.460 --> 1:30:05.020
 I imagine that it's possible to dilute the mind sufficiently

1:30:05.020 --> 1:30:07.000
 that you genuinely, in that way,

1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:10.780
 do think that you are interacting with the real world

1:30:10.780 --> 1:30:12.980
 when in fact the whole thing's a simulation.

1:30:14.340 --> 1:30:17.260
 How good does a simulation need to be to be able to do that?

1:30:17.260 --> 1:30:21.380
 Well, it needs to convince you

1:30:21.380 --> 1:30:24.140
 that all your sensory input is correct and accurate

1:30:24.140 --> 1:30:26.620
 and joins up and makes sense.

1:30:26.620 --> 1:30:28.380
 Now, that sensory input is not something

1:30:28.380 --> 1:30:29.740
 that we're born with.

1:30:29.740 --> 1:30:31.660
 We're born with a sense of touch.

1:30:31.660 --> 1:30:33.020
 We're born with eyes and so on,

1:30:33.020 --> 1:30:34.120
 but we don't know how to use them.

1:30:34.120 --> 1:30:35.740
 We don't know what to make of them.

1:30:35.740 --> 1:30:37.460
 We go around, we bump into trees.

1:30:37.460 --> 1:30:38.660
 We cry a lot.

1:30:38.660 --> 1:30:39.620
 We're in pain a lot.

1:30:39.620 --> 1:30:43.080
 We're basically booting up the system

1:30:43.080 --> 1:30:45.340
 so that it can make head or tail

1:30:45.340 --> 1:30:47.580
 of the sensory input that it's getting.

1:30:47.580 --> 1:30:49.980
 And that sensory input's not just a one way flux of things.

1:30:49.980 --> 1:30:51.580
 It's also, you have to walk into things.

1:30:51.580 --> 1:30:52.420
 You have to hear things.

1:30:52.420 --> 1:30:53.700
 You have to put it together.

1:30:53.700 --> 1:30:58.140
 Now, if you've got just babies in the matrix

1:30:58.140 --> 1:30:59.940
 who are slotted into this,

1:30:59.940 --> 1:31:02.540
 I don't think they have that kind of sensory input.

1:31:02.540 --> 1:31:03.740
 I don't think they would have any way

1:31:03.740 --> 1:31:08.420
 to make sense of New York as a world that they're part of.

1:31:08.420 --> 1:31:10.740
 The brain is just not developed in that way.

1:31:10.740 --> 1:31:12.380
 Well, I can't make sense of New York

1:31:12.380 --> 1:31:13.920
 in this physical reality either.

1:31:13.920 --> 1:31:16.300
 But yeah, I mean, but you said pain

1:31:16.300 --> 1:31:17.840
 and the walking into things.

1:31:17.840 --> 1:31:19.760
 Well, you can create a pain signal.

1:31:19.760 --> 1:31:21.900
 And as long as it's consistent,

1:31:21.900 --> 1:31:23.860
 that certain things result in pain,

1:31:23.860 --> 1:31:25.860
 you can start to construct a reality.

1:31:25.860 --> 1:31:28.460
 There's some, maybe you disagree with this,

1:31:28.460 --> 1:31:33.300
 but I think we are born almost with a desire

1:31:33.300 --> 1:31:35.820
 to be convinced by our reality,

1:31:35.820 --> 1:31:38.860
 like a desire to make sense of our reality.

1:31:38.860 --> 1:31:40.240
 Oh, I'm sure we are, yes.

1:31:40.240 --> 1:31:41.140
 So there's an imperative.

1:31:41.140 --> 1:31:43.980
 So whatever that reality is given to us,

1:31:43.980 --> 1:31:46.580
 like the table hurts, fire is hot.

1:31:46.580 --> 1:31:49.900
 I think we wanna be diluted

1:31:49.900 --> 1:31:53.100
 in the sense that we want to make a simple,

1:31:53.100 --> 1:31:56.440
 like Einstein's simple theory of the thing around us.

1:31:56.440 --> 1:31:58.020
 We want that simplicity.

1:31:58.020 --> 1:32:02.220
 And so maybe the hunger for the simplicity

1:32:02.220 --> 1:32:03.860
 is the thing that could be used

1:32:03.860 --> 1:32:07.820
 to construct a pretty dumb simulation that tricks us.

1:32:07.820 --> 1:32:09.100
 So maybe tricking humans

1:32:09.100 --> 1:32:11.500
 doesn't require building a universe.

1:32:11.500 --> 1:32:12.580
 No, I don't.

1:32:12.580 --> 1:32:14.500
 I mean, this is not what I work on,

1:32:14.500 --> 1:32:15.900
 so I don't know how close to it we are.

1:32:15.900 --> 1:32:16.740
 I don't think anyone works on it.

1:32:16.740 --> 1:32:18.740
 But I agree with you that, yeah,

1:32:18.740 --> 1:32:21.980
 I'm not sure that it's a morally justifiable thing to do,

1:32:21.980 --> 1:32:24.820
 but is it possible in principle?

1:32:26.500 --> 1:32:28.420
 I think it would be very difficult,

1:32:28.420 --> 1:32:31.540
 but I don't see why in principle it wouldn't be possible.

1:32:31.540 --> 1:32:35.860
 And I agree with you that we try to understand the world.

1:32:35.860 --> 1:32:38.060
 We try to integrate the sensory inputs that we have,

1:32:38.060 --> 1:32:40.180
 and we try to come up with a hypothesis

1:32:40.180 --> 1:32:41.980
 that explains what's going on.

1:32:41.980 --> 1:32:46.260
 I think though that we have huge input

1:32:46.260 --> 1:32:49.140
 from the social context that we're in.

1:32:49.140 --> 1:32:50.500
 We don't do it by ourselves.

1:32:50.500 --> 1:32:53.500
 We don't kind of blunder around in a universe by ourself

1:32:53.500 --> 1:32:55.980
 and understand the whole thing.

1:32:55.980 --> 1:32:58.060
 We're told by the people around us

1:32:58.060 --> 1:32:59.420
 what things are and what they do,

1:32:59.420 --> 1:33:01.680
 and language is coming in here and so on.

1:33:01.680 --> 1:33:05.300
 So it would have to be an extremely impressive simulation

1:33:05.300 --> 1:33:08.240
 to simulate all of that.

1:33:08.240 --> 1:33:10.340
 Yeah, simulate all of that,

1:33:10.340 --> 1:33:12.100
 including the social construct,

1:33:12.100 --> 1:33:15.940
 the spread of ideas and the exchange of ideas.

1:33:15.940 --> 1:33:16.780
 I don't know.

1:33:16.780 --> 1:33:18.660
 But those questions are really important to understand

1:33:18.660 --> 1:33:22.060
 as we become more and more digital creatures.

1:33:22.060 --> 1:33:23.780
 It seems like the next step of evolution

1:33:23.780 --> 1:33:28.300
 is us becoming all the same mechanisms we've talked about

1:33:28.300 --> 1:33:31.860
 are becoming more and more plugged into the machine.

1:33:31.860 --> 1:33:34.100
 We're becoming cyborgs.

1:33:34.100 --> 1:33:36.660
 And there's an interesting interplay

1:33:36.660 --> 1:33:38.600
 between wires and biology.

1:33:40.420 --> 1:33:43.500
 Zeros and ones and the biological systems.

1:33:43.500 --> 1:33:48.500
 And I don't think we'll have the luxury

1:33:48.700 --> 1:33:51.180
 to see humans as disjoint from the technology

1:33:51.180 --> 1:33:53.500
 we've created for much longer.

1:33:53.500 --> 1:33:55.500
 We are an organism that's.

1:33:56.540 --> 1:34:00.300
 Yeah, I mean, I agree with you.

1:34:00.300 --> 1:34:05.300
 But we come really with this to consciousness.

1:34:06.100 --> 1:34:06.940
 Yes.

1:34:06.940 --> 1:34:08.180
 And is there a distinction there?

1:34:08.180 --> 1:34:09.620
 Because what you're saying,

1:34:09.620 --> 1:34:12.020
 the natural end point says we are indistinguishable,

1:34:12.020 --> 1:34:17.020
 that if you are capable of building an AI,

1:34:17.100 --> 1:34:19.700
 which is sufficiently close and similar

1:34:19.700 --> 1:34:20.660
 that we merge with it,

1:34:20.660 --> 1:34:23.620
 then to all intents and purposes,

1:34:23.620 --> 1:34:26.220
 that AI is conscious as we know it.

1:34:26.220 --> 1:34:31.220
 And I don't have a strong view, but I have a view.

1:34:35.100 --> 1:34:37.780
 And I wrote about it in the epilogue to my last book,

1:34:37.780 --> 1:34:39.580
 because 10 years ago,

1:34:39.580 --> 1:34:44.420
 I wrote a chapter in a book called Life Ascending

1:34:44.420 --> 1:34:45.900
 about consciousness.

1:34:45.900 --> 1:34:47.380
 And the subtitle of Life Ascending

1:34:47.380 --> 1:34:49.940
 was The 10 Great Inventions of Evolution.

1:34:49.940 --> 1:34:51.340
 And I couldn't possibly write a book

1:34:51.340 --> 1:34:54.540
 with a subtitle like that that did not include consciousness.

1:34:54.540 --> 1:34:56.820
 And specifically consciousness

1:34:56.820 --> 1:34:59.420
 as one of the great inventions.

1:34:59.420 --> 1:35:02.540
 And it was in part because I was just curious to know more

1:35:02.540 --> 1:35:04.380
 and I read more for that chapter.

1:35:04.380 --> 1:35:06.340
 I never worked on it, but I've always,

1:35:06.340 --> 1:35:09.220
 how can anyone not be interested in the question?

1:35:09.220 --> 1:35:13.220
 And I was left with the feeling that A, nobody knows,

1:35:13.220 --> 1:35:18.220
 and B, there are two main schools of thought out there

1:35:18.260 --> 1:35:21.180
 with a big kind of skew in distribution.

1:35:21.180 --> 1:35:23.780
 One of them says, oh, it's a property of matter.

1:35:23.780 --> 1:35:26.300
 It's an unknown law of physics.

1:35:26.300 --> 1:35:28.180
 Panpsychism, everything is conscious.

1:35:28.180 --> 1:35:29.100
 The sun is conscious.

1:35:29.100 --> 1:35:31.380
 It's just a matter of, or a rock is conscious.

1:35:31.380 --> 1:35:33.700
 It's just a matter of how much.

1:35:33.700 --> 1:35:36.460
 And I find that very unpersuasive.

1:35:36.460 --> 1:35:37.740
 I can't say that it's wrong.

1:35:37.740 --> 1:35:41.380
 It's just that I think we somehow can tell the difference

1:35:41.380 --> 1:35:44.020
 between something that's living and something that's not.

1:35:45.060 --> 1:35:48.820
 And then the other end is it's an emergent property

1:35:48.820 --> 1:35:51.340
 of a very complex central nervous system.

1:35:51.340 --> 1:35:56.340
 And I never quite understand what people mean

1:35:56.340 --> 1:35:57.820
 by words like emergence.

1:35:57.820 --> 1:35:59.580
 I mean, there are genuine examples,

1:35:59.580 --> 1:36:03.740
 but I think we very often tend to use it

1:36:03.740 --> 1:36:06.900
 to plaster over ignorance.

1:36:08.020 --> 1:36:10.580
 As a biochemist, the question for me then was,

1:36:10.580 --> 1:36:15.580
 okay, it's a concoction of a central nervous system.

1:36:16.140 --> 1:36:20.260
 A depolarizing neuron gives rise to a feeling,

1:36:20.260 --> 1:36:24.660
 to a feeling of pain, or to a feeling of love,

1:36:24.660 --> 1:36:27.700
 or anger, or whatever it may be.

1:36:27.700 --> 1:36:30.580
 So what is then a feeling in biophysical terms

1:36:30.580 --> 1:36:31.820
 in the central nervous system?

1:36:31.820 --> 1:36:34.780
 Which bit of the wiring gives rise to,

1:36:34.780 --> 1:36:38.060
 and I've never seen anyone answer that question

1:36:38.060 --> 1:36:41.220
 in a way that makes sense to me.

1:36:41.220 --> 1:36:43.700
 And that's an important question to answer.

1:36:43.700 --> 1:36:45.380
 I think if we want to understand consciousness,

1:36:45.380 --> 1:36:47.180
 that's the only question to answer.

1:36:47.180 --> 1:36:51.780
 Because certainly an AI is capable of out thinking,

1:36:51.780 --> 1:36:53.460
 and it's only a matter of time.

1:36:53.460 --> 1:36:54.940
 Maybe it's already happened.

1:36:54.940 --> 1:36:58.260
 In terms of just information processing

1:36:58.260 --> 1:37:00.020
 and computational skill,

1:37:00.020 --> 1:37:04.220
 I don't think we have any problem in designing a mind

1:37:04.220 --> 1:37:07.300
 which is at least the equal of the human mind.

1:37:07.300 --> 1:37:11.180
 But in terms of what we value the most as humans,

1:37:11.180 --> 1:37:13.300
 which is to say our feelings, our emotions,

1:37:13.300 --> 1:37:18.300
 our sense of what the world is in a very personal way,

1:37:20.140 --> 1:37:23.540
 that I think means as much or more to people

1:37:23.540 --> 1:37:24.900
 than their information processing.

1:37:24.900 --> 1:37:28.700
 And that's where I don't think that AI necessarily

1:37:28.700 --> 1:37:31.460
 will become conscious, because I think

1:37:31.460 --> 1:37:33.060
 it's the property of life.

1:37:33.060 --> 1:37:34.220
 Well, let's talk about it more.

1:37:34.220 --> 1:37:36.820
 You're an incredible writer, one of my favorite writers.

1:37:36.820 --> 1:37:40.420
 So let me read from your latest book, Transformers,

1:37:40.420 --> 1:37:42.760
 what you write about consciousness.

1:37:42.760 --> 1:37:46.180
 I think therefore I am, said Descartes,

1:37:46.180 --> 1:37:49.300
 is one of the most celebrated lines ever written.

1:37:49.300 --> 1:37:51.580
 But what am I exactly?

1:37:51.580 --> 1:37:54.660
 An artificial intelligence can think too, by definition,

1:37:54.660 --> 1:37:58.140
 and therefore is, yet few of us could agree

1:37:58.140 --> 1:38:00.760
 whether AI is capable in principle

1:38:00.760 --> 1:38:03.180
 of anything resembling human emotions,

1:38:03.180 --> 1:38:08.180
 of love or hate, fear and joy, of spiritual yearnings,

1:38:08.500 --> 1:38:10.660
 for oneness or oblivion,

1:38:10.660 --> 1:38:14.220
 or corporeal pangs of thirst and hunger.

1:38:14.220 --> 1:38:18.100
 The problem is we don't know what emotions are,

1:38:18.100 --> 1:38:19.380
 as you were saying.

1:38:19.380 --> 1:38:21.780
 What is the feeling in physical terms?

1:38:21.780 --> 1:38:23.800
 How does a discharging neuron give rise

1:38:23.800 --> 1:38:25.680
 to a feeling of anything at all?

1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:28.620
 This is the hard problem of consciousness,

1:38:28.620 --> 1:38:31.180
 the seeming duality of mind and matter,

1:38:31.180 --> 1:38:34.260
 the physical makeup of our innermost self.

1:38:34.260 --> 1:38:35.640
 We can understand in principle

1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:38.780
 how an extremely sophisticated parallel processing system

1:38:38.780 --> 1:38:41.500
 could be capable of wondrous feats of intelligence,

1:38:41.500 --> 1:38:44.140
 but we can't answer in principle

1:38:44.140 --> 1:38:46.200
 whether such a supreme intelligence

1:38:46.200 --> 1:38:49.160
 would experience joy or melancholy.

1:38:49.160 --> 1:38:51.180
 What is the quantum of solace?

1:38:52.980 --> 1:38:56.060
 I, speaking to the question of emergence,

1:38:57.060 --> 1:38:59.180
 you know, there's just technical,

1:39:00.900 --> 1:39:03.820
 there's an excellent paper on this recently

1:39:03.820 --> 1:39:08.140
 about this kind of phase transition,

1:39:08.140 --> 1:39:10.800
 emergence of performance in neural networks

1:39:10.800 --> 1:39:14.980
 on the problem of NLP, natural language processing.

1:39:14.980 --> 1:39:19.460
 So language models, there seems to be this question of size.

1:39:19.460 --> 1:39:23.940
 At some point, there is a phase transition

1:39:23.940 --> 1:39:25.940
 as you grow the size of the neural network.

1:39:25.940 --> 1:39:27.300
 So the question is,

1:39:27.300 --> 1:39:29.980
 that's sort of somewhat of a technical question

1:39:29.980 --> 1:39:32.060
 that you can philosophize over.

1:39:32.060 --> 1:39:33.300
 The technical question is,

1:39:33.300 --> 1:39:35.740
 is there a size of a neural network

1:39:35.740 --> 1:39:39.140
 that starts to be able to form the kind of representations

1:39:39.140 --> 1:39:40.740
 that can capture a language,

1:39:40.740 --> 1:39:44.740
 and therefore be able to, not just language,

1:39:44.740 --> 1:39:47.120
 but linguistically capture knowledge

1:39:47.120 --> 1:39:50.940
 that's sufficient to solve a lot of problems in language,

1:39:50.940 --> 1:39:52.580
 like be able to have a conversation.

1:39:52.580 --> 1:39:55.780
 And there seems to be not a gradual increase,

1:39:55.780 --> 1:39:57.100
 but a phase transition.

1:39:57.100 --> 1:40:01.200
 And they're trying to construct the science of where that is,

1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:03.620
 like what is a good size of a neural network,

1:40:03.620 --> 1:40:05.900
 and why does such a phase transition happen?

1:40:05.900 --> 1:40:08.660
 Anyway, that sort of points to emergence,

1:40:08.660 --> 1:40:13.660
 that there could be stages where a thing goes

1:40:15.100 --> 1:40:18.940
 from being, oh, you're very intelligent toaster,

1:40:20.180 --> 1:40:25.020
 to a toaster that's feeling sad today and turns away

1:40:25.020 --> 1:40:29.180
 and looks out the window, sighing,

1:40:29.180 --> 1:40:30.660
 having an existential crisis.

1:40:30.660 --> 1:40:33.700
 Thinking of Marvin, the paranoid android.

1:40:33.700 --> 1:40:38.260
 Marvin is simplistic because Marvin is just cranky.

1:40:38.260 --> 1:40:39.100
 Yes.

1:40:40.100 --> 1:40:41.580
 So easily programmed.

1:40:41.580 --> 1:40:45.220
 Yeah, easily programmed, nonstop existential crisis.

1:40:45.220 --> 1:40:47.300
 You're almost basically, what is it?

1:40:47.300 --> 1:40:48.820
 Notes from Underground by Dostoevsky,

1:40:48.820 --> 1:40:53.040
 like just constantly complaining about life.

1:40:53.040 --> 1:40:57.140
 No, they're capturing the full rollercoaster

1:40:57.140 --> 1:41:00.140
 of human emotion, the excitement, the bliss,

1:41:00.140 --> 1:41:03.940
 the connection, the empathy and all that kind of stuff.

1:41:03.940 --> 1:41:08.940
 And then the selfishness, the anger, the depression,

1:41:09.100 --> 1:41:09.940
 all that kind of stuff.

1:41:09.940 --> 1:41:11.860
 They're capturing all of that

1:41:11.860 --> 1:41:14.420
 and be able to experience it deeply.

1:41:14.420 --> 1:41:16.580
 Like it's the most important thing

1:41:16.580 --> 1:41:18.540
 you could possibly experience today.

1:41:18.540 --> 1:41:21.300
 The highest highs, the lowest lows, this is it.

1:41:21.300 --> 1:41:22.740
 My life will be over.

1:41:24.460 --> 1:41:26.740
 I cannot possibly go on that feeling.

1:41:26.740 --> 1:41:30.580
 And then like after a nap, you're feeling amazing.

1:41:30.580 --> 1:41:33.620
 That might be something that emerges.

1:41:33.620 --> 1:41:38.620
 So why would a nap make an AI being feel better?

1:41:42.580 --> 1:41:45.220
 First of all, we don't know that for a human either, right?

1:41:45.220 --> 1:41:47.620
 But we do know that that's actually true

1:41:47.620 --> 1:41:48.980
 for many people much of the time.

1:41:48.980 --> 1:41:50.820
 You may be utterly depressed and you have a nap

1:41:50.820 --> 1:41:53.460
 and you do in fact feel better, so.

1:41:53.460 --> 1:41:55.660
 Oh, you are actually asking the technical question there,

1:41:55.660 --> 1:41:57.940
 is there, so that's a very,

1:41:57.940 --> 1:41:59.980
 there's a biological answer to that.

1:41:59.980 --> 1:42:01.980
 And so the question is whether AI needs to have

1:42:01.980 --> 1:42:04.860
 the same kind of attachments to its body,

1:42:04.860 --> 1:42:07.580
 bodily function and preservation

1:42:08.540 --> 1:42:11.300
 of the brain's successful function,

1:42:13.180 --> 1:42:17.060
 self preservation essentially in some deep biological sense.

1:42:17.060 --> 1:42:19.940
 I mean, to my mind, it comes back round

1:42:19.940 --> 1:42:21.660
 to the problem we were talking about before

1:42:21.660 --> 1:42:24.100
 about simulations and sensory input

1:42:24.100 --> 1:42:28.580
 and learning what all of this stuff means

1:42:28.580 --> 1:42:29.740
 and life and death,

1:42:31.420 --> 1:42:35.100
 that biology unlike society has a death penalty

1:42:35.100 --> 1:42:37.820
 over everything and natural selection works

1:42:37.820 --> 1:42:38.980
 on that death penalty.

1:42:38.980 --> 1:42:43.980
 That if you make this decision wrongly, you die.

1:42:47.340 --> 1:42:50.780
 And the next generation is represented by beings

1:42:50.780 --> 1:42:54.420
 that made a slightly different decision on balance.

1:42:56.380 --> 1:42:58.620
 And that is something that's intrinsically

1:43:00.980 --> 1:43:04.260
 difficult to simulate in all this richness, I would say.

1:43:06.020 --> 1:43:07.380
 So what is?

1:43:09.060 --> 1:43:11.100
 Death in all its richness.

1:43:11.100 --> 1:43:12.060
 Yeah.

1:43:12.060 --> 1:43:16.580
 Our relationship with death or the whole of it.

1:43:16.580 --> 1:43:20.140
 So which when you say richness, of course,

1:43:20.140 --> 1:43:21.380
 there's a lot in that.

1:43:21.380 --> 1:43:22.220
 Yeah.

1:43:22.220 --> 1:43:23.860
 Which is hard to simulate.

1:43:23.860 --> 1:43:27.660
 What's part of the richness that's hard to simulate?

1:43:27.660 --> 1:43:31.020
 I suppose the complexity of the environment

1:43:31.020 --> 1:43:33.340
 and your position in that or the position

1:43:33.340 --> 1:43:35.460
 of an organism in that environment,

1:43:35.460 --> 1:43:37.540
 in the full richness of that environment

1:43:37.540 --> 1:43:40.620
 over its entire life, over multiple generations

1:43:40.620 --> 1:43:44.220
 with changes in gene sequence over those generations.

1:43:44.220 --> 1:43:46.860
 So slight changes in the makeup of those individuals

1:43:46.860 --> 1:43:48.300
 over generations.

1:43:48.300 --> 1:43:51.340
 But if you take it back to the level of single cells,

1:43:52.460 --> 1:43:57.460
 which I do in the book and ask how does a single cell

1:43:59.340 --> 1:44:02.340
 in effect know it exists as a unit, as an entity?

1:44:02.340 --> 1:44:03.980
 I mean, no, in inverted commas,

1:44:03.980 --> 1:44:07.100
 obviously it doesn't know anything,

1:44:07.100 --> 1:44:09.060
 but it acts as a unit and it acts

1:44:09.060 --> 1:44:13.740
 with astonishing precision as a unit.

1:44:14.660 --> 1:44:17.300
 And I had suggested that that's linked

1:44:17.300 --> 1:44:19.860
 to the electrical fields on the membranes themselves

1:44:19.860 --> 1:44:21.900
 and that they give some indication

1:44:21.900 --> 1:44:24.340
 of how am I doing in relation to my environment

1:44:24.340 --> 1:44:27.180
 as a kind of real time feedback on the world.

1:44:28.340 --> 1:44:31.020
 And this is something physical,

1:44:32.020 --> 1:44:34.940
 which can be selected over generations

1:44:34.940 --> 1:44:37.460
 that if you get this wrong,

1:44:39.180 --> 1:44:42.300
 it's linked with this set of circumstances

1:44:42.300 --> 1:44:45.500
 that I've just, as an individual,

1:44:45.500 --> 1:44:47.820
 I have a moment of blind panic and run

1:44:49.140 --> 1:44:50.620
 as a bacterium or something.

1:44:50.620 --> 1:44:54.180
 You have some electrical discharge that says blind panic

1:44:54.180 --> 1:44:56.580
 and it runs whatever it may be.

1:44:56.580 --> 1:44:59.820
 And you associate over generations, multiple generations

1:44:59.820 --> 1:45:03.660
 that this electrical phase that I'm in now

1:45:03.660 --> 1:45:07.100
 is associated with a response like that.

1:45:07.100 --> 1:45:09.860
 And it's easy to see how feelings come in

1:45:09.860 --> 1:45:17.700
 through the back door almost with that kind of giving real time

1:45:17.700 --> 1:45:19.500
 feedback on your position in the world

1:45:19.500 --> 1:45:22.060
 in relation to how am I doing.

1:45:22.060 --> 1:45:23.900
 And then you complexify the system

1:45:23.900 --> 1:45:27.780
 and yes, I have no problem with phase transition.

1:45:27.780 --> 1:45:36.420
 And can all of this be done purely by the language,

1:45:36.420 --> 1:45:41.780
 by the issues with how the system understands itself?

1:45:42.620 --> 1:45:44.220
 Maybe it can, I honestly don't know.

1:45:45.260 --> 1:45:47.580
 But the philosophers for a long time

1:45:47.580 --> 1:45:49.700
 have talked about the possibility

1:45:49.700 --> 1:45:52.980
 that you can have a zombie intelligence

1:45:54.100 --> 1:45:55.660
 and that there are no feelings there,

1:45:55.660 --> 1:45:57.500
 but everything else is the same.

1:45:59.460 --> 1:46:01.460
 I mean, I have to throw this back to you really.

1:46:01.460 --> 1:46:03.980
 How do you deal with the zombie intelligence?

1:46:03.980 --> 1:46:08.620
 So first of all, I can see that from a biologist perspective,

1:46:08.620 --> 1:46:10.740
 you think of all the complexities

1:46:10.740 --> 1:46:12.860
 that led up to the human being.

1:46:12.860 --> 1:46:15.780
 The entirety of the history of four billion years

1:46:15.780 --> 1:46:18.860
 that in some deep sense integrated the human being

1:46:18.860 --> 1:46:20.180
 into this environment.

1:46:20.180 --> 1:46:25.020
 And that dance of the organism and the environment,

1:46:25.020 --> 1:46:27.380
 you could see how emotions arise from that.

1:46:27.380 --> 1:46:29.740
 And then emotions are deeply connected

1:46:29.740 --> 1:46:32.020
 and creating a human experience.

1:46:32.020 --> 1:46:34.180
 And from that, you mix in consciousness

1:46:34.180 --> 1:46:36.340
 and the full mess of it, yeah.

1:46:37.260 --> 1:46:40.900
 But from a perspective of an intelligent organism

1:46:40.900 --> 1:46:45.220
 that's already here, like a baby that learns,

1:46:45.220 --> 1:46:49.420
 it doesn't need to learn how to be a collection of cells

1:46:49.420 --> 1:46:52.260
 or how to do all the things it needs to do.

1:46:52.260 --> 1:46:55.340
 The basic function of a baby as it learns

1:46:55.340 --> 1:46:57.380
 is to interact with its environment,

1:46:57.380 --> 1:46:58.620
 to learn from its environment,

1:46:58.620 --> 1:47:01.820
 to learn how to fit in to the social society,

1:47:01.820 --> 1:47:03.180
 to like...

1:47:03.180 --> 1:47:05.940
 And the basic response of the baby

1:47:05.940 --> 1:47:07.100
 is to cry a lot of the time.

1:47:07.100 --> 1:47:12.100
 To cry, well, to convince the humans to protect it

1:47:12.540 --> 1:47:14.940
 or to discipline it, to teach it.

1:47:14.940 --> 1:47:18.780
 I mean, we've developed a bunch of different tricks,

1:47:18.780 --> 1:47:22.100
 how to get our parents to take care of us,

1:47:22.100 --> 1:47:24.860
 to educate us, to teach us about the world.

1:47:24.860 --> 1:47:27.900
 Also, we've constructed the world in such a way

1:47:27.900 --> 1:47:30.380
 that it's safe enough for us to survive in

1:47:30.380 --> 1:47:32.780
 and yet dangerous enough for learning the valuable lessons.

1:47:32.780 --> 1:47:35.580
 Like the tables are still hard with corners,

1:47:35.580 --> 1:47:36.820
 so it can still run into them.

1:47:36.820 --> 1:47:38.740
 It hurts like how...

1:47:38.740 --> 1:47:41.660
 So AI needs to solve that problem,

1:47:41.660 --> 1:47:43.060
 not the problem of constructing

1:47:43.060 --> 1:47:46.260
 this super complex organism that leads up...

1:47:47.980 --> 1:47:49.420
 To run the whole...

1:47:51.660 --> 1:47:53.940
 To make an apple pie, to build the whole universe,

1:47:53.940 --> 1:47:55.900
 you need to build a whole universe.

1:47:55.900 --> 1:48:00.540
 I think the zombie question is something

1:48:01.780 --> 1:48:04.020
 I would leave to the philosophers.

1:48:04.020 --> 1:48:06.220
 Because...

1:48:08.260 --> 1:48:11.180
 And I will also leave to them the definition of love

1:48:11.180 --> 1:48:14.900
 and what happens between two human beings

1:48:14.900 --> 1:48:18.540
 when there's a magic that just grabs them.

1:48:18.540 --> 1:48:20.700
 Like nothing else matters in the world

1:48:20.700 --> 1:48:22.980
 and somehow you've been searching for this feeling,

1:48:22.980 --> 1:48:25.260
 this moment, this person your whole life.

1:48:25.260 --> 1:48:29.540
 That feeling, the philosophers can have a lot of fun

1:48:29.540 --> 1:48:32.820
 with that one and also say that that's just...

1:48:32.820 --> 1:48:34.700
 You can have a biological explanation,

1:48:34.700 --> 1:48:35.740
 you can have all kinds of...

1:48:35.740 --> 1:48:38.300
 It's all fake, it's actually...

1:48:38.300 --> 1:48:40.700
 Ayn Rand will say it's all selfish.

1:48:40.700 --> 1:48:42.420
 There's a lot of different interpretations.

1:48:42.420 --> 1:48:43.620
 I'll leave it to the philosophers.

1:48:43.620 --> 1:48:48.020
 The point is the feeling sure as hell feels very real.

1:48:48.020 --> 1:48:51.860
 And if my toaster makes me feel

1:48:51.860 --> 1:48:55.740
 like it's the only toaster in the world.

1:48:55.740 --> 1:48:58.420
 And when I leave and I miss the toaster

1:48:58.420 --> 1:49:01.420
 and when I come back, I'm excited to see the toaster

1:49:01.420 --> 1:49:03.980
 and my life is meaningful and joyful

1:49:03.980 --> 1:49:08.100
 and the friends I have around me get a better version of me

1:49:08.100 --> 1:49:09.700
 because that toaster exists.

1:49:10.740 --> 1:49:13.340
 That sure as hell feels like a conscious toaster.

1:49:13.340 --> 1:49:16.020
 Is that psychologically different to having a dog?

1:49:16.020 --> 1:49:16.860
 No.

1:49:16.860 --> 1:49:19.260
 Because I mean most people would dispute

1:49:19.260 --> 1:49:20.540
 whether we can say a dog...

1:49:20.540 --> 1:49:22.220
 I would say a dog is undoubtedly conscious,

1:49:22.220 --> 1:49:24.060
 but some people say it doesn't.

1:49:24.060 --> 1:49:26.260
 But there's degrees of consciousness and so on,

1:49:26.260 --> 1:49:28.780
 but people are definitely much more uncomfortable

1:49:28.780 --> 1:49:32.620
 saying a toaster can be conscious than a dog.

1:49:32.620 --> 1:49:35.060
 And there's still a deep connection.

1:49:35.060 --> 1:49:37.860
 You could say our relationship with the dog

1:49:37.860 --> 1:49:40.100
 has more to do with anthropomorphism.

1:49:40.100 --> 1:49:42.380
 Like we kind of project the human being onto it.

1:49:42.380 --> 1:49:43.220
 Maybe.

1:49:43.220 --> 1:49:45.780
 We can do the same damn thing with a toaster.

1:49:45.780 --> 1:49:48.100
 Yes, but you can look into the dog's eyes

1:49:48.100 --> 1:49:50.460
 and you can see that it's sad,

1:49:50.460 --> 1:49:52.500
 that it's delighted to see you again.

1:49:52.500 --> 1:49:53.900
 I don't have a dog, by the way.

1:49:53.900 --> 1:49:54.740
 It's not that I'm a dog person or a cat person.

1:49:54.740 --> 1:49:56.380
 And dogs are actually incredibly good

1:49:56.380 --> 1:49:59.460
 at using their eyes to do just that.

1:49:59.460 --> 1:50:00.300
 They are.

1:50:00.300 --> 1:50:02.660
 Now, I don't imagine that a dog is remotely

1:50:02.660 --> 1:50:07.060
 as close to being intelligent as an AI intelligence,

1:50:07.060 --> 1:50:09.540
 but it's certainly capable

1:50:09.540 --> 1:50:11.980
 of communicating emotionally with us.

1:50:11.980 --> 1:50:13.860
 But here's what I would venture to say.

1:50:13.860 --> 1:50:17.140
 We tend to think because AI plays chess well

1:50:17.140 --> 1:50:19.700
 and is able to fold proteins now well,

1:50:19.700 --> 1:50:21.020
 that it's intelligent.

1:50:21.020 --> 1:50:23.860
 I would argue that in order to communicate with humans,

1:50:23.860 --> 1:50:25.900
 in order to have emotional intelligence,

1:50:25.900 --> 1:50:27.420
 it actually requires another order

1:50:27.420 --> 1:50:28.900
 of magnitude of intelligence.

1:50:28.900 --> 1:50:32.660
 It's not easy to be flawed.

1:50:34.100 --> 1:50:38.380
 Solving a mathematical puzzle is not the same

1:50:38.380 --> 1:50:42.060
 as the full complexity of human to human interaction.

1:50:42.060 --> 1:50:46.980
 That's actually, we humans just take for granted

1:50:46.980 --> 1:50:49.180
 the things we're really good at.

1:50:49.180 --> 1:50:52.700
 Nonstop, people tell me how shitty people are driving.

1:50:52.700 --> 1:50:56.580
 No, humans are incredible at driving.

1:50:56.580 --> 1:51:00.260
 Bipedal walking, walking, object manipulation.

1:51:00.260 --> 1:51:01.860
 We're incredible at this.

1:51:01.860 --> 1:51:05.820
 And so people tend to discount the things

1:51:05.820 --> 1:51:07.380
 we all just take for granted.

1:51:07.380 --> 1:51:10.180
 And one of those things that they discount

1:51:10.180 --> 1:51:13.580
 is our ability, the dance of conversation

1:51:13.580 --> 1:51:15.340
 and interaction with each other.

1:51:15.340 --> 1:51:18.460
 The ability to morph ideas together.

1:51:18.460 --> 1:51:20.380
 The ability to get angry at each other

1:51:20.380 --> 1:51:21.940
 and then to miss each other.

1:51:21.940 --> 1:51:24.980
 Like to create a tension that makes life fun

1:51:24.980 --> 1:51:28.300
 and difficult and challenging in a way that's meaningful.

1:51:28.300 --> 1:51:31.660
 That is a skill that's learned

1:51:31.660 --> 1:51:33.460
 and AI would need to solve that problem.

1:51:33.460 --> 1:51:35.980
 I mean, in some sense, what you're saying is

1:51:37.020 --> 1:51:42.020
 AI cannot become meaningfully emotional, let's say,

1:51:42.380 --> 1:51:45.220
 until it experiences some kind of internal conflict

1:51:45.220 --> 1:51:48.500
 that is unable to reconcile these various aspects

1:51:48.500 --> 1:51:53.500
 of reality or its reality with a decision to make.

1:51:54.700 --> 1:51:56.820
 And then it feels sad, necessarily,

1:51:56.820 --> 1:51:59.460
 because it doesn't know what to do.

1:51:59.460 --> 1:52:01.740
 And I certainly can't dispute that.

1:52:01.740 --> 1:52:03.700
 That may very well be how it works.

1:52:03.700 --> 1:52:05.780
 I think the only way to find out is to do it.

1:52:05.780 --> 1:52:06.700
 And to build it.

1:52:06.700 --> 1:52:08.460
 Yeah, and leave it to the philosophers

1:52:08.460 --> 1:52:10.280
 if it actually feels sad or not.

1:52:11.220 --> 1:52:13.860
 The point is the robot will be sitting there alone

1:52:13.860 --> 1:52:16.940
 having an internal conflict, an existential crisis,

1:52:16.940 --> 1:52:19.300
 and that's required for it to have a deep,

1:52:19.300 --> 1:52:21.560
 meaningful connection with another human being.

1:52:21.560 --> 1:52:23.300
 Now, does it actually feel that?

1:52:23.300 --> 1:52:24.140
 I don't know.

1:52:24.140 --> 1:52:26.060
 But I'd like to throw something else at you,

1:52:26.060 --> 1:52:29.220
 which troubles me on reading it.

1:52:31.140 --> 1:52:35.140
 Noah Harari's book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century.

1:52:35.140 --> 1:52:36.520
 And he's written about this kind of thing

1:52:36.520 --> 1:52:38.440
 on various occasions.

1:52:38.440 --> 1:52:40.740
 And he sees biochemistry as an algorithm.

1:52:40.740 --> 1:52:45.160
 And then AI will necessarily be able to hack that algorithm

1:52:45.160 --> 1:52:46.320
 and do it better than humans.

1:52:46.320 --> 1:52:48.800
 So there will be AI better at writing music

1:52:48.800 --> 1:52:50.720
 that we appreciate than Mozart ever could,

1:52:50.720 --> 1:52:53.040
 or writing better than Shakespeare ever did, and so on.

1:52:53.040 --> 1:52:55.560
 Because biochemistry is algorithmic,

1:52:55.560 --> 1:52:56.880
 and all you need to do is figure out

1:52:56.880 --> 1:52:58.720
 which bits of the algorithm to play

1:52:58.720 --> 1:53:02.360
 to make us feel good or bad or appreciate things.

1:53:02.360 --> 1:53:05.680
 And as a biochemist, I find that argument

1:53:05.680 --> 1:53:10.680
 an argument close to irrefutable and not very enjoyable.

1:53:13.320 --> 1:53:14.840
 I don't like the sound of it.

1:53:14.840 --> 1:53:16.480
 That's just my reaction as a human being.

1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:18.160
 You might like the sound of it because that says

1:53:18.160 --> 1:53:23.160
 that AI is capable of the same kind of emotional feelings

1:53:23.440 --> 1:53:25.540
 about the world as we are,

1:53:25.540 --> 1:53:27.080
 because the whole thing is an algorithm

1:53:27.080 --> 1:53:30.200
 and you can program an algorithm, and there you are.

1:53:31.160 --> 1:53:33.520
 He then has a peculiar final chapter

1:53:33.520 --> 1:53:36.080
 where he talks about consciousness

1:53:36.080 --> 1:53:37.640
 in rather separate terms.

1:53:37.640 --> 1:53:39.800
 And he's talking about meditating and so on

1:53:39.800 --> 1:53:41.460
 and getting in touch with his inner conscious.

1:53:41.460 --> 1:53:44.620
 I don't meditate, I don't know anything about that.

1:53:44.620 --> 1:53:48.160
 But he wrote in very different terms about it,

1:53:48.160 --> 1:53:50.900
 as if somehow it's a way out of the algorithm.

1:53:52.240 --> 1:53:56.100
 Now, it seems to me that consciousness in that sense

1:53:56.100 --> 1:53:58.740
 is capable of scuppering the algorithm.

1:53:58.740 --> 1:54:01.880
 I think in terms of the biochemical feedback loops

1:54:01.880 --> 1:54:04.840
 and so on, it is undoubtedly algorithmic.

1:54:04.840 --> 1:54:06.900
 But in terms of what we decide to do,

1:54:07.880 --> 1:54:10.880
 it can be much more based on an emotion.

1:54:14.840 --> 1:54:16.960
 We can just think, I don't care.

1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:20.280
 I can't resolve this complex situation.

1:54:20.280 --> 1:54:21.540
 I'm gonna do that.

1:54:21.540 --> 1:54:24.760
 And that can be based on, in effect, a different currency,

1:54:24.760 --> 1:54:27.040
 which is the currency of feelings and something

1:54:27.040 --> 1:54:29.980
 where we don't have very much personal control over.

1:54:29.980 --> 1:54:32.040
 And then it comes back around to you

1:54:32.040 --> 1:54:35.360
 and what are you trying to get at with AI?

1:54:35.360 --> 1:54:38.060
 Do we need to have some system

1:54:38.060 --> 1:54:41.840
 which is capable of overriding a rational decision

1:54:41.840 --> 1:54:42.680
 which cannot be made

1:54:42.680 --> 1:54:45.080
 because there's too much conflicting information

1:54:45.080 --> 1:54:48.500
 by effectively an emotional judgmental decision

1:54:48.500 --> 1:54:50.960
 that just says, do this and see what happens.

1:54:50.960 --> 1:54:53.400
 That's what consciousness is really doing in my view.

1:54:53.400 --> 1:54:56.480
 Yeah, and the question is whether it's a different process

1:54:56.480 --> 1:54:59.020
 or just a higher level process.

1:54:59.020 --> 1:55:02.360
 I might, you know, the idea that biochemistry

1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:07.360
 is an algorithm is, to me, an oversimplistic view.

1:55:07.480 --> 1:55:12.480
 There's a lot of things that the moment you say it,

1:55:13.320 --> 1:55:17.040
 it's irrefutable, but it simplifies.

1:55:17.040 --> 1:55:17.880
 Of course.

1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:21.000
 And in the process loses something fundamental.

1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:23.480
 So for example, calling a universe

1:55:23.480 --> 1:55:27.360
 and an information processing system, sure, yes.

1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:29.720
 You could make that.

1:55:29.720 --> 1:55:32.160
 It's a computer that's performing computations,

1:55:32.160 --> 1:55:37.160
 but you're missing the process of the entropy

1:55:40.720 --> 1:55:42.760
 somehow leading to pockets of complexity

1:55:42.760 --> 1:55:45.360
 that creates these beautiful artifacts

1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:48.880
 that are incredibly complex and they're like machines.

1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:52.000
 And then those machines are through the process of evolution

1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:54.560
 are constructing even further complexity.

1:55:54.560 --> 1:55:59.560
 Like in calling universe information processing machine,

1:55:59.860 --> 1:56:03.000
 you're missing those little local pockets

1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:05.100
 and how difficult it is to create them.

1:56:05.100 --> 1:56:07.880
 So the question to me is if biochemistry is an algorithm,

1:56:07.880 --> 1:56:11.980
 how difficult is it to create a software system

1:56:11.980 --> 1:56:16.240
 that runs the human body, which I think is incorrect.

1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:20.000
 I think that is going to take so long.

1:56:21.160 --> 1:56:23.500
 I mean, that's going to be centuries from now

1:56:23.500 --> 1:56:25.600
 to be able to reconstruct the human.

1:56:25.600 --> 1:56:27.600
 Now, what I would venture to say

1:56:27.600 --> 1:56:30.400
 to get some of the magic of a human being

1:56:30.400 --> 1:56:32.880
 with what we're saying with the emotions

1:56:32.880 --> 1:56:36.400
 and the interactions and like a dog makes a smile

1:56:36.400 --> 1:56:38.200
 and joyful and all those kinds of things

1:56:38.200 --> 1:56:39.640
 that will come much sooner,

1:56:39.640 --> 1:56:42.280
 but that doesn't require us to reverse engineer

1:56:42.280 --> 1:56:44.080
 the algorithm of biochemistry.

1:56:44.080 --> 1:56:47.680
 Yes, but the toaster is making you happy.

1:56:47.680 --> 1:56:48.640
 Yes.

1:56:48.640 --> 1:56:51.840
 It's not about whether you make the toaster happy.

1:56:51.840 --> 1:56:52.680
 No, it has to be.

1:56:52.680 --> 1:56:55.120
 It has to be.

1:56:55.120 --> 1:56:56.160
 It has to be.

1:56:56.160 --> 1:56:58.060
 The toaster has to be able to leave me happy.

1:56:58.060 --> 1:57:00.080
 Yeah, but it's the toaster is the AI in this case

1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:00.920
 is very intelligent.

1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:03.980
 Yeah, the toaster has to be able to be unhappy and leave me.

1:57:03.980 --> 1:57:06.360
 That's essential.

1:57:06.360 --> 1:57:07.200
 Yeah.

1:57:07.200 --> 1:57:09.780
 That's essential for my being able to miss the toaster.

1:57:09.780 --> 1:57:12.240
 If the toaster is just my servant,

1:57:12.240 --> 1:57:16.000
 that's not, or a provider of like services,

1:57:17.720 --> 1:57:20.440
 like tells me the weather makes toast,

1:57:20.440 --> 1:57:22.760
 that's not going to deep connection.

1:57:22.760 --> 1:57:24.900
 It has to have internal conflict.

1:57:24.900 --> 1:57:26.740
 You write about life and death.

1:57:26.740 --> 1:57:29.840
 It has to be able to be conscious of its mortality

1:57:30.940 --> 1:57:33.760
 and the finiteness of its existence.

1:57:33.760 --> 1:57:35.880
 And that life is for temporary

1:57:35.880 --> 1:57:38.000
 and therefore it needs to be more selective.

1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:41.040
 One of the most moving moments in the movies

1:57:41.040 --> 1:57:45.080
 from when I was a boy was the unplugging of Hal in 2001,

1:57:45.080 --> 1:57:48.620
 where that was the death of a sentient being

1:57:48.620 --> 1:57:51.000
 and Hal knew it.

1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:54.320
 So I think we all kind of know

1:57:55.260 --> 1:58:00.140
 that a sufficiently intelligent being

1:58:00.140 --> 1:58:02.760
 is going to have some form of consciousness,

1:58:02.760 --> 1:58:06.820
 but whether it would be like biological consciousness,

1:58:06.820 --> 1:58:07.660
 I just don't know.

1:58:07.660 --> 1:58:10.220
 And if you're thinking about how do we bring together,

1:58:10.220 --> 1:58:12.320
 I mean, obviously we're going to interact

1:58:13.320 --> 1:58:16.240
 more closely with AI,

1:58:16.240 --> 1:58:21.240
 but is a dog really like a toaster

1:58:21.640 --> 1:58:25.680
 or is there really some kind of difference there?

1:58:25.680 --> 1:58:29.480
 You were talking about biochemistry is algorithmic,

1:58:29.480 --> 1:58:31.400
 but it's not single algorithm

1:58:31.400 --> 1:58:33.180
 and it's very complex, of course it is.

1:58:33.180 --> 1:58:35.840
 So it may be that there are again conflicts

1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:37.160
 in the circuits of biochemistry,

1:58:37.160 --> 1:58:40.980
 but I have a feeling that the level of complexity

1:58:40.980 --> 1:58:43.280
 of the total biochemical system

1:58:43.280 --> 1:58:45.560
 at the level of a single cell is less complex

1:58:45.560 --> 1:58:48.800
 than the level of neural networking in the human brain

1:58:48.800 --> 1:58:49.720
 or in an AI.

1:58:52.320 --> 1:58:55.760
 Well, I guess I assumed that we were including the brain

1:58:55.760 --> 1:58:59.880
 in the biochemistry algorithm, because you have to...

1:58:59.880 --> 1:59:02.040
 I would see that as a higher level of organization

1:59:02.040 --> 1:59:02.900
 of neural networks.

1:59:02.900 --> 1:59:04.880
 They're all using the same biochemical wiring

1:59:04.880 --> 1:59:06.400
 within themselves.

1:59:06.400 --> 1:59:09.740
 Yeah, but the human brain is not just neurons.

1:59:09.740 --> 1:59:11.640
 It's the immune system.

1:59:11.640 --> 1:59:13.840
 It's the whole package.

1:59:13.840 --> 1:59:16.280
 I mean, to have a biochemical algorithm

1:59:16.280 --> 1:59:20.060
 that runs an intelligent biological system,

1:59:20.060 --> 1:59:21.680
 you have to include the whole damn thing.

1:59:21.680 --> 1:59:24.440
 And it's pretty fascinating that it comes from like,

1:59:24.440 --> 1:59:29.080
 from an embryo, like the whole, I mean, oh boy.

1:59:29.080 --> 1:59:33.220
 I mean, if you can, what is a human being?

1:59:33.220 --> 1:59:36.320
 Because it's just some code and then you built,

1:59:36.320 --> 1:59:39.880
 and then that says DNA doesn't just tell you what to build,

1:59:39.880 --> 1:59:40.880
 but how to build it.

1:59:40.880 --> 1:59:44.640
 I mean, the thing is impressive.

1:59:44.640 --> 1:59:49.480
 And the question is how difficult is it

1:59:49.480 --> 1:59:51.440
 to reverse engineer the whole shebang?

1:59:52.940 --> 1:59:54.400
 Very difficult.

1:59:54.400 --> 1:59:55.820
 I would say it's,

1:59:59.680 --> 2:00:01.200
 don't want to say impossible,

2:00:01.200 --> 2:00:05.380
 but it's like, it's much easier to build a human

2:00:05.380 --> 2:00:09.760
 than to reverse engineer, to build like a fake human,

2:00:09.760 --> 2:00:12.960
 human like thing than to reverse engineer

2:00:12.960 --> 2:00:15.960
 the entirety of the process of the evolution.

2:00:15.960 --> 2:00:18.560
 I'm not sure if we are capable

2:00:18.560 --> 2:00:21.160
 of reverse engineering the whole thing.

2:00:21.160 --> 2:00:23.720
 If the human mind is capable of doing that.

2:00:23.720 --> 2:00:26.720
 I mean, I wouldn't be a biologist if I wasn't trying,

2:00:27.960 --> 2:00:31.160
 but I know I can't understand the whole problem.

2:00:31.160 --> 2:00:33.300
 I'm just trying to understand the rudimentary outlines

2:00:33.300 --> 2:00:34.360
 of the problem.

2:00:35.700 --> 2:00:37.280
 There's another aspect though,

2:00:37.280 --> 2:00:39.200
 you're talking about developing from a single cell

2:00:39.200 --> 2:00:43.920
 to the human mind and all the part system,

2:00:43.920 --> 2:00:46.680
 subsystems that are part of the immune system and so on.

2:00:48.960 --> 2:00:53.240
 This is something that you'll talk about, I imagine,

2:00:53.240 --> 2:00:58.240
 with Michael Levin, but so little is known about,

2:01:00.720 --> 2:01:02.200
 you talk about reverse engineering,

2:01:02.200 --> 2:01:04.640
 so little is known about the developmental pathways

2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:09.160
 that go from a genome to going to a fully wired organism.

2:01:09.160 --> 2:01:11.360
 And a lot of it seems to depend on the same

2:01:11.360 --> 2:01:16.040
 in electrical interactions that I was talking about

2:01:16.040 --> 2:01:17.720
 happening at the level of single cells

2:01:17.720 --> 2:01:19.200
 and its interaction with the environment.

2:01:19.200 --> 2:01:23.600
 There's a whole electrical field side to biology

2:01:23.600 --> 2:01:27.040
 that is not yet written into any of the textbooks,

2:01:27.040 --> 2:01:29.600
 which is about how does an embryo develop into

2:01:29.600 --> 2:01:32.520
 or a single cell develop into these complex systems?

2:01:32.520 --> 2:01:35.040
 What defines the head, what defines the immune system,

2:01:35.040 --> 2:01:37.160
 what defines the brain and so on?

2:01:37.160 --> 2:01:38.680
 That really is written in a language

2:01:38.680 --> 2:01:40.360
 that we're only just beginning to understand

2:01:40.360 --> 2:01:42.840
 and frankly, biologists, most biologists

2:01:42.840 --> 2:01:47.280
 are still very reluctant to even get themselves tangled up

2:01:47.280 --> 2:01:51.680
 in questions like electrical fields influencing development.

2:01:51.680 --> 2:01:54.520
 It seems like mumbo jumbo to a lot of biologists

2:01:54.520 --> 2:01:55.800
 and it should not be because this is

2:01:55.800 --> 2:01:58.840
 the 21st century biology, this is where it's going.

2:01:59.700 --> 2:02:02.080
 But we're not gonna reverse engineer a human being

2:02:02.080 --> 2:02:04.360
 or the mind or any of these subsystems

2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:06.920
 until we understand how this developmental process

2:02:06.920 --> 2:02:10.000
 or how electricity in biology really works.

2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:13.640
 And if it is linked with feelings

2:02:13.640 --> 2:02:15.920
 and with consciousness and so on,

2:02:15.920 --> 2:02:18.680
 that's the, I mean, in the meantime, we have to try,

2:02:18.680 --> 2:02:21.040
 but I think that's where the answer lies.

2:02:22.680 --> 2:02:27.040
 So you think it's possible that the key to things

2:02:27.040 --> 2:02:31.500
 like consciousness are some of the more tricky aspects

2:02:31.500 --> 2:02:34.680
 of cognition might lie in that early development,

2:02:34.680 --> 2:02:37.400
 the interaction of electricity and biology.

2:02:39.300 --> 2:02:40.840
 Electrical fields.

2:02:40.840 --> 2:02:43.100
 But we already know the EEG and so on

2:02:43.100 --> 2:02:44.820
 is telling us a lot about brain function,

2:02:44.820 --> 2:02:46.700
 but we don't know which cells, which parts

2:02:46.700 --> 2:02:48.860
 of a neural network is giving rise to the EEG.

2:02:48.860 --> 2:02:50.520
 We don't know the basics.

2:02:50.520 --> 2:02:53.640
 The assumption is, I mean, we know it's neural networks,

2:02:53.640 --> 2:02:55.740
 we know it's multiple cells, hundreds or thousands

2:02:55.740 --> 2:02:57.980
 of cells involved in it and we assume

2:02:57.980 --> 2:03:01.560
 that it has to do with depolarization during action

2:03:01.560 --> 2:03:03.480
 potentials and so on.

2:03:03.480 --> 2:03:05.360
 But the mitochondria which are in there

2:03:05.360 --> 2:03:08.060
 have much more membranes than the plasma membrane

2:03:08.060 --> 2:03:10.760
 of the neuron and there's a much greater membrane potential

2:03:10.760 --> 2:03:14.420
 and it's formed in parallel, very often parallel cristae,

2:03:14.420 --> 2:03:17.600
 which are capable of reinforcing a field

2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:19.760
 and generating fields over longer distances.

2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:23.300
 And nobody knows if that plays a role

2:03:23.300 --> 2:03:24.600
 in consciousness or not.

2:03:24.600 --> 2:03:26.400
 There's reasons to argue that it could,

2:03:26.400 --> 2:03:28.900
 but frankly we simply do not know

2:03:28.900 --> 2:03:31.000
 and it's not taken into consideration.

2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:35.260
 You look at the structure of the mitochondrial membranes

2:03:35.260 --> 2:03:39.440
 in the brains of simple things like Drosophila,

2:03:39.440 --> 2:03:42.160
 the fruit fly, and they have amazing structures.

2:03:42.160 --> 2:03:44.200
 You can see lots of little rectangular things

2:03:44.200 --> 2:03:48.040
 all lined up in amazing patterns.

2:03:48.040 --> 2:03:49.040
 What are they doing?

2:03:49.040 --> 2:03:49.920
 Why are they like that?

2:03:49.920 --> 2:03:51.280
 We haven't the first clue.

2:03:52.460 --> 2:03:55.340
 What do you think about organoids and brain organoids

2:03:55.340 --> 2:03:59.560
 and so in a lab trying to study the development

2:03:59.560 --> 2:04:04.560
 of these in the Petri dish development of organs.

2:04:05.840 --> 2:04:06.860
 Do you think that's promising?

2:04:06.860 --> 2:04:08.640
 Do you have to look at whole systems?

2:04:08.640 --> 2:04:10.320
 I've never done anything like that.

2:04:10.320 --> 2:04:11.440
 I don't know much about it.

2:04:11.440 --> 2:04:13.640
 The people who I've talked to who do work on it

2:04:13.640 --> 2:04:15.160
 say amazing things can happen

2:04:15.160 --> 2:04:18.480
 and a bit of a brain grown in a dish

2:04:18.480 --> 2:04:21.400
 is capable of experiencing some kind of feelings

2:04:21.400 --> 2:04:23.480
 or even memories of its former brain.

2:04:23.480 --> 2:04:27.420
 Again, I have a feeling that until we understand

2:04:27.420 --> 2:04:29.540
 how to control the electrical fields

2:04:29.540 --> 2:04:32.340
 that control development, we're not going to understand

2:04:32.340 --> 2:04:35.280
 how to turn an organoid into a real functional system.

2:04:36.620 --> 2:04:38.500
 But how do we get that understanding?

2:04:38.500 --> 2:04:41.940
 It's so incredibly difficult.

2:04:41.940 --> 2:04:44.700
 I mean, you would have to, I mean, one promising direction,

2:04:44.700 --> 2:04:46.820
 I'd love to get your opinion on this.

2:04:46.820 --> 2:04:49.020
 I don't know if you're familiar with the work of DeepMind

2:04:49.020 --> 2:04:52.180
 and AlphaFold with protein folding and so on.

2:04:52.180 --> 2:04:54.060
 Do you think it's possible

2:04:54.060 --> 2:04:57.980
 that that will give us some breakthroughs in biology

2:04:57.980 --> 2:05:02.980
 trying to basically simulate and model the behavior

2:05:03.700 --> 2:05:07.180
 of trivial biological systems

2:05:07.180 --> 2:05:09.900
 as they become complex biological systems?

2:05:11.420 --> 2:05:12.780
 I'm sure it will.

2:05:12.780 --> 2:05:16.340
 The interesting thing to me about protein folding

2:05:16.340 --> 2:05:19.780
 is that for a long time, my understanding,

2:05:19.780 --> 2:05:21.580
 this is not what I work on, so I may have got this wrong,

2:05:21.580 --> 2:05:24.460
 but my understanding is that you take the sequence

2:05:24.460 --> 2:05:27.720
 of a protein and you try to fold it.

2:05:28.980 --> 2:05:31.020
 And there are multiple ways in which it can fold.

2:05:31.020 --> 2:05:33.180
 And to come up with the correct conformation

2:05:33.180 --> 2:05:35.100
 is not a very easy thing because you're doing it

2:05:35.100 --> 2:05:37.420
 from first principles from a string of letters,

2:05:37.420 --> 2:05:39.900
 which specify the string of amino acids.

2:05:39.900 --> 2:05:43.460
 But what actually happens is when a protein

2:05:43.460 --> 2:05:45.740
 is coming out of a ribosome,

2:05:45.740 --> 2:05:47.940
 it's coming out of a charged tunnel

2:05:47.940 --> 2:05:49.620
 and it's in a very specific environment,

2:05:49.620 --> 2:05:51.460
 which is going to force this to go there now

2:05:51.460 --> 2:05:53.340
 and then this one to go there and this one to come like that.

2:05:53.340 --> 2:05:55.900
 And so you're forcing a specific conformational set

2:05:55.900 --> 2:05:58.420
 of changes onto it as it comes out of the ribosome.

2:05:58.420 --> 2:06:00.060
 So by the time it's fully emerged,

2:06:00.060 --> 2:06:01.860
 it's already got its shape.

2:06:01.860 --> 2:06:06.540
 And that shape depended on the immediate environment

2:06:06.540 --> 2:06:09.100
 that it was emerging into one letter,

2:06:09.100 --> 2:06:11.900
 one amino acid at a time.

2:06:11.900 --> 2:06:16.900
 And I don't think that the field was looking at it that way.

2:06:16.980 --> 2:06:18.740
 And if that's correct,

2:06:18.740 --> 2:06:20.540
 then that's very characteristic of science,

2:06:20.540 --> 2:06:23.100
 which is to say it asks very often the wrong question

2:06:23.100 --> 2:06:25.820
 and then does really amazingly sophisticated analyses

2:06:25.820 --> 2:06:27.860
 on something having never thought to actually think,

2:06:27.860 --> 2:06:29.060
 well, what is biology doing?

2:06:29.060 --> 2:06:31.860
 And biology is giving you a charged electrical environment

2:06:31.860 --> 2:06:33.380
 that forces you to be this way.

2:06:33.380 --> 2:06:37.940
 Now, did DeepMind come up through patterns

2:06:37.940 --> 2:06:39.780
 with some answer that was like that?

2:06:39.780 --> 2:06:41.820
 I've got absolutely no idea.

2:06:41.820 --> 2:06:44.420
 It ought to be possible to deduce that

2:06:44.420 --> 2:06:46.500
 from the shapes of proteins.

2:06:46.500 --> 2:06:50.780
 It would require a much greater skill

2:06:50.780 --> 2:06:52.820
 than the human mind has.

2:06:52.820 --> 2:06:55.140
 But the human mind is capable of saying, well, hang on,

2:06:55.140 --> 2:06:57.080
 let's look at this exit tunnel and try and work out

2:06:57.080 --> 2:06:58.940
 what shape is this protein going to take?

2:06:58.940 --> 2:07:00.140
 And we can figure that out.

2:07:00.140 --> 2:07:01.580
 That's really interesting about the exit tunnel,

2:07:01.580 --> 2:07:03.060
 but like sometimes we get lucky

2:07:03.060 --> 2:07:08.060
 and just like in science, the simplified view

2:07:08.540 --> 2:07:12.140
 or the static view will actually solve the problem for us.

2:07:12.140 --> 2:07:14.380
 So in this case, it's very possible

2:07:14.380 --> 2:07:17.220
 that the sequence of letters has a unique mapping

2:07:17.220 --> 2:07:21.440
 to our structure without considering how it unraveled.

2:07:21.440 --> 2:07:23.740
 So without considering the tunnel.

2:07:23.740 --> 2:07:27.700
 And so that seems to be the case in this situation

2:07:27.700 --> 2:07:29.700
 where the cool thing about proteins,

2:07:29.700 --> 2:07:31.580
 all the different shapes they can possibly take,

2:07:31.580 --> 2:07:35.300
 it actually seems to take very specific unique shapes

2:07:35.300 --> 2:07:36.660
 given the sequence.

2:07:36.660 --> 2:07:38.260
 That's forced on you by an exit tunnel.

2:07:38.260 --> 2:07:40.780
 So the problem is actually much simpler than you thought.

2:07:40.780 --> 2:07:44.200
 And then there's a whole army of proteins

2:07:44.200 --> 2:07:49.200
 which change the conformational state, chaperone proteins.

2:07:49.780 --> 2:07:54.780
 And they're only used when there's some presumably issue

2:07:54.900 --> 2:07:56.500
 with how it came out of the exit tunnel

2:07:56.500 --> 2:07:58.020
 and you wanna do it differently to that.

2:07:58.020 --> 2:08:00.780
 So very often the chaperone proteins will go there

2:08:00.780 --> 2:08:03.520
 and will influence the way in which it falls.

2:08:03.520 --> 2:08:06.620
 So there's two ways of doing it.

2:08:06.620 --> 2:08:09.280
 Either you can look at the structures

2:08:09.280 --> 2:08:11.020
 and the sequences of all the proteins

2:08:11.020 --> 2:08:13.220
 and you can apply an immense mind to it

2:08:13.220 --> 2:08:14.620
 and figure out what the patterns are

2:08:14.620 --> 2:08:15.660
 and figure out what happened.

2:08:15.660 --> 2:08:17.940
 Or you can look at the actual situation where it is

2:08:17.940 --> 2:08:20.100
 and say, well, hang on, it was actually quite simple.

2:08:20.100 --> 2:08:21.220
 It's got a charged environment

2:08:21.220 --> 2:08:23.140
 and then it's forced to come out this way.

2:08:23.140 --> 2:08:24.040
 And then the question will be,

2:08:24.040 --> 2:08:25.460
 well, do different ribosomes

2:08:25.460 --> 2:08:27.060
 have different charged environments?

2:08:27.060 --> 2:08:28.780
 What happens if a chaperone?

2:08:28.780 --> 2:08:30.460
 You're asking a different set of questions

2:08:30.460 --> 2:08:31.780
 to come to the same answer in a way

2:08:31.780 --> 2:08:34.260
 which is telling you a much simpler story

2:08:34.260 --> 2:08:37.800
 and explains why it is rather than saying it could be,

2:08:37.800 --> 2:08:41.060
 this is one in a billion different possible conformational

2:08:41.060 --> 2:08:42.340
 states that this protein could have.

2:08:42.340 --> 2:08:43.460
 You're saying, well, it has this one

2:08:43.460 --> 2:08:46.060
 because that was the only one it could take

2:08:46.060 --> 2:08:48.340
 given its setting.

2:08:48.340 --> 2:08:51.100
 Well, yeah, I mean, currently humans are very good

2:08:51.100 --> 2:08:52.940
 at that kind of first principles thinking.

2:08:52.940 --> 2:08:56.060
 I was stepping back, but I think AI is really good

2:08:56.060 --> 2:08:58.980
 at collecting a huge amount of data

2:08:58.980 --> 2:09:01.980
 and a huge amount of data of observation of planets

2:09:01.980 --> 2:09:04.520
 and figure out that Earth is not at the center

2:09:04.520 --> 2:09:06.480
 of the universe, that there's actually a sun,

2:09:06.480 --> 2:09:08.020
 we're orbiting the sun.

2:09:08.020 --> 2:09:10.060
 But then you can, as a human being, ask,

2:09:10.060 --> 2:09:13.180
 well, how do solar systems come to be?

2:09:15.240 --> 2:09:17.540
 What are the different forces that are required

2:09:17.540 --> 2:09:19.940
 to make this kind of pattern emerge?

2:09:19.940 --> 2:09:22.600
 And then you start to invent things like gravity.

2:09:26.600 --> 2:09:29.820
 I mixed up the ordering of gravity,

2:09:29.820 --> 2:09:32.640
 wasn't considered as a thing that connects planets,

2:09:32.640 --> 2:09:36.900
 but we are able to think about those big picture things

2:09:36.900 --> 2:09:38.300
 as human beings.

2:09:38.300 --> 2:09:42.260
 AI is just very good to infer simple models

2:09:42.260 --> 2:09:44.280
 from a huge amount of data.

2:09:45.820 --> 2:09:47.980
 And the question is with biology,

2:09:47.980 --> 2:09:50.980
 we kind of go back and forth at how we solve biology.

2:09:50.980 --> 2:09:54.500
 Listen, protein folding was thought to be impossible

2:09:54.500 --> 2:09:57.580
 to solve, and there's a lot of brilliant PhD students

2:09:57.580 --> 2:09:59.460
 that worked one protein at a time

2:09:59.460 --> 2:10:00.900
 trying to figure out the structure.

2:10:00.900 --> 2:10:03.540
 And the fact that I was able to do that.

2:10:03.540 --> 2:10:06.340
 Oh, I'm not knocking it at all,

2:10:06.340 --> 2:10:08.940
 but I think that people have been asking

2:10:08.940 --> 2:10:09.780
 the wrong question.

2:10:09.780 --> 2:10:13.500
 But then, as the people start to ask

2:10:13.500 --> 2:10:17.220
 better and bigger questions,

2:10:17.220 --> 2:10:20.980
 the AI kind of enters the chat and says,

2:10:20.980 --> 2:10:22.700
 I'll help you out with that.

2:10:22.700 --> 2:10:25.100
 Can I give you another example for my own work?

2:10:27.580 --> 2:10:30.700
 The risk of getting a disease as we get older,

2:10:32.260 --> 2:10:35.260
 there are genetic aspects to it.

2:10:35.260 --> 2:10:38.500
 If you spend your whole life overeating and smoking

2:10:38.500 --> 2:10:41.580
 and whatever, that's a whole separate question.

2:10:41.580 --> 2:10:43.260
 But there's a genetic side to the risk.

2:10:43.260 --> 2:10:46.540
 And we know a few genes that increase your risk

2:10:46.540 --> 2:10:47.380
 of certain things.

2:10:47.380 --> 2:10:49.660
 And for probably 20 years now,

2:10:49.660 --> 2:10:51.660
 people have been doing what's called GWAS,

2:10:51.660 --> 2:10:55.300
 which is genome wide association studies.

2:10:55.300 --> 2:10:58.820
 So you've effectively scanned the entire genome

2:10:58.820 --> 2:11:02.220
 for any single nucleotide polymorphisms,

2:11:02.220 --> 2:11:04.980
 which is to say a single letter change in one place,

2:11:04.980 --> 2:11:07.460
 that has a higher association of being linked

2:11:07.460 --> 2:11:09.260
 with a particular disease or not.

2:11:09.260 --> 2:11:10.940
 And you can come up with thousands of these things

2:11:10.940 --> 2:11:11.820
 across the genome.

2:11:13.260 --> 2:11:17.180
 And if you add them all up and try and say,

2:11:17.180 --> 2:11:20.820
 well, so do they add up to explain

2:11:20.820 --> 2:11:23.700
 the known genetic risk of this disease?

2:11:23.700 --> 2:11:26.180
 And the known genetic risk often comes from twin studies.

2:11:26.180 --> 2:11:30.620
 And you can say that if this twin gets epilepsy,

2:11:30.620 --> 2:11:33.620
 there's a 40 or 50% risk that the other twin,

2:11:33.620 --> 2:11:35.820
 identical twin will also get epilepsy.

2:11:35.820 --> 2:11:39.100
 Therefore, the genetic factor is about 50%.

2:11:39.100 --> 2:11:43.020
 And so the gene similarities that you see

2:11:43.020 --> 2:11:46.420
 should account for 50% of that known risk.

2:11:46.420 --> 2:11:49.220
 Very often it accounts for less than a 10th

2:11:49.220 --> 2:11:50.820
 of the known risk.

2:11:50.820 --> 2:11:52.980
 And there's two possible explanations.

2:11:52.980 --> 2:11:54.460
 And there's one which people tend to do,

2:11:54.460 --> 2:11:55.300
 which is to say,

2:11:55.300 --> 2:11:58.180
 ah, well, we don't have enough statistical power.

2:11:58.180 --> 2:12:00.260
 If we, maybe there's a million,

2:12:00.260 --> 2:12:01.620
 we've only found a thousand of them.

2:12:01.620 --> 2:12:02.860
 But if we find the other million,

2:12:02.860 --> 2:12:03.820
 they're weakly related,

2:12:03.820 --> 2:12:05.140
 but there's a huge number of them.

2:12:05.140 --> 2:12:07.420
 And so we'll account for that whole risk.

2:12:07.420 --> 2:12:10.060
 Maybe there's a billion of them.

2:12:11.500 --> 2:12:12.780
 So that's one way.

2:12:12.780 --> 2:12:14.260
 The other way is to say,

2:12:15.260 --> 2:12:17.020
 well, hang on a minute, you're missing a system here.

2:12:17.020 --> 2:12:19.140
 That system is the mitochondrial DNA,

2:12:19.140 --> 2:12:21.860
 which people tend to dismiss because it's small

2:12:21.860 --> 2:12:25.020
 and it doesn't change very much.

2:12:27.020 --> 2:12:30.860
 But a few single letter changes in that mitochondrial DNA,

2:12:30.860 --> 2:12:33.620
 it controls some really basic processes.

2:12:33.620 --> 2:12:36.540
 It controls not only all the energy

2:12:36.540 --> 2:12:38.780
 that we need to live and to move around

2:12:38.780 --> 2:12:39.700
 and do everything we do,

2:12:39.700 --> 2:12:44.380
 but also biosynthesis to make the new building blocks

2:12:44.380 --> 2:12:47.420
 to make new cells.

2:12:47.420 --> 2:12:49.780
 And cancer cells very often kind of take over

2:12:49.780 --> 2:12:52.100
 the mitochondria and rewire them

2:12:52.100 --> 2:12:54.620
 so that instead of using them for making energy,

2:12:54.620 --> 2:12:56.500
 they're effectively using them as precursors

2:12:56.500 --> 2:12:58.460
 for the building blocks for biosynthesis.

2:12:58.460 --> 2:12:59.940
 You need to make new amino acids,

2:12:59.940 --> 2:13:01.380
 new nucleotides for DNA.

2:13:01.380 --> 2:13:04.700
 You wanna make new lipids to make your membranes and so on.

2:13:04.700 --> 2:13:06.940
 So they kind of rewire metabolism.

2:13:06.940 --> 2:13:10.220
 Now, the problem is that we've got all these interactions

2:13:10.220 --> 2:13:13.420
 between mitochondrial DNA and the genes in the nucleus

2:13:13.420 --> 2:13:15.380
 that are overlooked completely

2:13:15.380 --> 2:13:16.660
 because people throw away,

2:13:16.660 --> 2:13:18.740
 literally throw away the mitochondrial genes.

2:13:18.740 --> 2:13:21.060
 And we can see in fruit flies that they interact

2:13:21.060 --> 2:13:24.500
 and produce big differences in risk.

2:13:24.500 --> 2:13:29.500
 So you can set AI onto this question

2:13:29.500 --> 2:13:34.500
 of exactly how many of these base changes there are.

2:13:35.100 --> 2:13:36.940
 And this is one possible solution

2:13:36.940 --> 2:13:39.100
 that maybe there are a million of them

2:13:39.100 --> 2:13:41.220
 and it does account for the greatest part of the risk.

2:13:41.220 --> 2:13:43.660
 Or the other one is they aren't, it's just not there.

2:13:43.660 --> 2:13:45.300
 That actually the risk lies in something

2:13:45.300 --> 2:13:47.140
 you weren't even looking at.

2:13:47.140 --> 2:13:50.860
 And this is where human intuition is very important.

2:13:50.860 --> 2:13:53.580
 And just this feeling that, well, I'm working on this

2:13:53.580 --> 2:13:56.220
 and I think it's important and I'm bloody minded about it.

2:13:56.220 --> 2:13:57.580
 And in the end, some people are right.

2:13:57.580 --> 2:14:00.180
 It turns out that it was important.

2:14:00.180 --> 2:14:03.180
 Can you get AI to do that, to be bloody minded?

2:14:03.180 --> 2:14:06.620
 And that, hang on a minute,

2:14:06.620 --> 2:14:09.340
 you might be missing a whole other system here

2:14:09.340 --> 2:14:11.140
 that's much bigger.

2:14:11.140 --> 2:14:16.140
 That's the moment of discovery of scientific revolution.

2:14:17.500 --> 2:14:21.380
 I'm giving up on saying AI can't do something.

2:14:22.260 --> 2:14:25.220
 I've said it enough times about enough things.

2:14:25.220 --> 2:14:27.460
 I think there's been a lot of progress.

2:14:27.460 --> 2:14:30.220
 And instead I'm excited by the possibility

2:14:30.220 --> 2:14:31.420
 of AI helping humans.

2:14:31.420 --> 2:14:34.420
 But at the same time, just like I said,

2:14:34.420 --> 2:14:37.380
 we seem to dismiss the power of humans.

2:14:37.380 --> 2:14:38.460
 Yes, yes.

2:14:38.460 --> 2:14:41.900
 Like we're so limited in so many ways

2:14:43.900 --> 2:14:48.540
 that we kind of, in what we feel like dumb ways,

2:14:48.540 --> 2:14:53.540
 like we're not strong, we're kind of our attention,

2:14:53.540 --> 2:14:57.060
 our attention, our memory is limited.

2:14:57.060 --> 2:15:00.260
 Our ability to focus on things is limited

2:15:00.260 --> 2:15:02.740
 in our own perception of what limited is.

2:15:02.740 --> 2:15:05.460
 But that actually, there's an incredible computer

2:15:05.460 --> 2:15:08.900
 behind the whole thing that makes this whole system work.

2:15:08.900 --> 2:15:11.860
 Our ability to interact with the environment,

2:15:11.860 --> 2:15:13.300
 to reason about the environment.

2:15:13.300 --> 2:15:14.940
 There's magic there.

2:15:14.940 --> 2:15:17.340
 And I'm hopeful that AI can capture

2:15:17.340 --> 2:15:18.740
 some of that same magic.

2:15:18.740 --> 2:15:20.820
 But that magic is not gonna look like

2:15:20.820 --> 2:15:22.460
 Deep Blue playing chess.

2:15:22.460 --> 2:15:24.740
 No, it's going to be more interesting.

2:15:24.740 --> 2:15:25.940
 But I don't think it's gonna look

2:15:25.940 --> 2:15:27.980
 like pattern finding either.

2:15:27.980 --> 2:15:29.620
 I mean, that's essentially what you're telling me.

2:15:29.620 --> 2:15:30.740
 It does very well at the moment.

2:15:30.740 --> 2:15:33.020
 And my point is it works very well

2:15:33.020 --> 2:15:36.180
 where you're looking for the right pattern.

2:15:36.180 --> 2:15:38.540
 But we are storytelling animals

2:15:38.540 --> 2:15:40.860
 and the hypothesis is a story.

2:15:40.860 --> 2:15:42.500
 It's a testable story.

2:15:42.500 --> 2:15:47.180
 But a new hypothesis is a leap into the unknown

2:15:47.180 --> 2:15:48.460
 and it's a new story basically.

2:15:48.460 --> 2:15:51.020
 And it says this leads to this leads to that.

2:15:51.020 --> 2:15:54.940
 It's a causal set of storytelling.

2:15:54.940 --> 2:15:57.420
 It's also possible that the leap into the unknown

2:15:57.420 --> 2:15:58.660
 has a pattern of its own.

2:15:58.660 --> 2:15:59.740
 Yes, it is.

2:15:59.740 --> 2:16:02.500
 And it's possible that it's learnable.

2:16:02.500 --> 2:16:04.260
 I'm sure it is.

2:16:04.260 --> 2:16:06.820
 There's a nice book by Arthur Kessler

2:16:06.820 --> 2:16:11.260
 on the nature of creativity.

2:16:11.260 --> 2:16:13.980
 And he likens it to a joke where the punchline goes off

2:16:13.980 --> 2:16:15.580
 in a completely unexpected direction

2:16:15.580 --> 2:16:18.500
 and says that this is the basis of human creativity.

2:16:18.500 --> 2:16:21.500
 That some creative switch of direction

2:16:21.500 --> 2:16:25.020
 to an unexpected place is similar to a joke.

2:16:25.020 --> 2:16:26.300
 I'm not saying that's how it works,

2:16:26.300 --> 2:16:29.380
 but it's a nice idea and there must be some truth in it.

2:16:30.740 --> 2:16:32.340
 And it's one of these,

2:16:32.340 --> 2:16:34.900
 most of the stories we tell are probably the wrong story

2:16:34.900 --> 2:16:37.580
 and probably going nowhere and probably not helpful.

2:16:37.580 --> 2:16:39.820
 And we definitely don't do as well

2:16:39.820 --> 2:16:41.700
 at seeing patterns in things.

2:16:41.700 --> 2:16:44.380
 But some of the most enjoyable human aspects

2:16:44.380 --> 2:16:47.660
 is finding a new story that goes to an unexpected place.

2:16:47.660 --> 2:16:48.940
 And again, these are all aspects

2:16:48.940 --> 2:16:51.580
 of what being human means to me.

2:16:52.580 --> 2:16:53.820
 And maybe these are all things

2:16:53.820 --> 2:16:55.780
 that AI figures out for itself,

2:16:55.780 --> 2:16:58.020
 or maybe they're just aspects.

2:16:58.020 --> 2:17:00.300
 But I just have the feeling sometimes

2:17:00.300 --> 2:17:04.860
 that the people who are trying to understand

2:17:04.860 --> 2:17:07.540
 what we are like,

2:17:08.780 --> 2:17:10.620
 if we wish to craft an AI system

2:17:10.620 --> 2:17:12.740
 which is somehow human like,

2:17:12.740 --> 2:17:16.500
 that we don't have a firm enough grasp

2:17:16.500 --> 2:17:20.580
 of what humans really are like in terms of how we are built.

2:17:21.460 --> 2:17:25.020
 But we get a better, better understanding of that.

2:17:25.020 --> 2:17:26.620
 I agree with you completely.

2:17:26.620 --> 2:17:29.300
 We try to build a thing and then we go,

2:17:29.300 --> 2:17:33.060
 hang on a minute, there's another system here.

2:17:33.060 --> 2:17:35.900
 And that's actually the attempt to build AI

2:17:35.900 --> 2:17:36.980
 that's human like,

2:17:36.980 --> 2:17:39.940
 is getting us to a deeper understanding of human beings.

2:17:39.940 --> 2:17:42.900
 The funny thing that I recently talked to Magnus Carlsen,

2:17:42.900 --> 2:17:44.700
 why they consider to be the greatest chess player

2:17:44.700 --> 2:17:46.620
 of all time.

2:17:46.620 --> 2:17:48.540
 And he talked about AlphaZero,

2:17:48.540 --> 2:17:51.620
 which is a system from DeepMind that plays chess.

2:17:51.620 --> 2:17:53.220
 And he had a funny comment.

2:17:55.260 --> 2:17:57.620
 He has a kind of dry sense of humor.

2:17:57.620 --> 2:17:59.460
 But he was extremely impressed

2:17:59.460 --> 2:18:02.100
 when he first saw AlphaZero play.

2:18:02.100 --> 2:18:04.620
 And he said that it did a lot of things

2:18:04.620 --> 2:18:07.460
 that could easily be mistaken for creativity.

2:18:07.460 --> 2:18:12.140
 So he like, as a typical human,

2:18:12.140 --> 2:18:16.860
 refused to give the system sort of its due.

2:18:16.860 --> 2:18:18.540
 Because he came up with a lot of things

2:18:18.540 --> 2:18:22.620
 that a lot of people are extremely impressed by.

2:18:22.620 --> 2:18:24.220
 Not just the sheer calculation,

2:18:24.220 --> 2:18:26.820
 but the brilliance of play.

2:18:26.820 --> 2:18:30.940
 So one of the things that it does

2:18:31.940 --> 2:18:35.460
 in really interesting ways is it sacrifices pieces.

2:18:35.460 --> 2:18:39.980
 So in chess, that means you basically take a few steps back

2:18:39.980 --> 2:18:41.700
 and then take a step forward.

2:18:41.700 --> 2:18:46.140
 You give away pieces for some future reward.

2:18:46.140 --> 2:18:50.740
 And that, for us humans, is where art is in chess.

2:18:50.740 --> 2:18:52.540
 You take big risks.

2:18:52.540 --> 2:18:57.540
 That for us humans, those risks are especially painful

2:18:58.620 --> 2:19:02.260
 because you have a fog of uncertainty before you.

2:19:02.260 --> 2:19:05.100
 So to take a risk now based on intuition

2:19:05.100 --> 2:19:07.460
 of I think this is the right risk to take,

2:19:07.460 --> 2:19:09.620
 but there's so many possibilities,

2:19:09.620 --> 2:19:11.300
 that that's where it takes guts.

2:19:11.300 --> 2:19:14.060
 That's where art is, that's that danger.

2:19:14.060 --> 2:19:17.860
 And then the alpha,

2:19:17.860 --> 2:19:20.460
 alpha zero takes those same kind of risks

2:19:20.460 --> 2:19:22.380
 and does them even greater degree.

2:19:22.380 --> 2:19:25.180
 But of course, it does it from a,

2:19:26.780 --> 2:19:30.340
 well, you could easily reduce down

2:19:30.340 --> 2:19:34.580
 to a cold calculation over patterns.

2:19:34.580 --> 2:19:37.820
 But boy, when you see the final result,

2:19:37.820 --> 2:19:39.980
 it sure looks like the same kind of magic

2:19:39.980 --> 2:19:41.900
 that we see in creativity.

2:19:41.900 --> 2:19:45.140
 When we see creative play on the chessboard,

2:19:45.140 --> 2:19:46.820
 but the chessboard is very limited.

2:19:46.820 --> 2:19:49.060
 And the question is, as we get better and better,

2:19:49.060 --> 2:19:54.060
 can we do that same kind of creativity in mathematics,

2:19:54.140 --> 2:19:59.140
 in programming, and then eventually in biology, psychology,

2:19:59.580 --> 2:20:04.020
 and expand into more and more complex systems?

2:20:04.020 --> 2:20:07.180
 I was, I used to go running when I was a boy,

2:20:07.180 --> 2:20:10.460
 and fell running, which is to say, running up and down mountains.

2:20:10.460 --> 2:20:12.740
 And I was never particularly great at it,

2:20:12.740 --> 2:20:16.780
 but there were some people who were amazingly fast,

2:20:16.780 --> 2:20:18.580
 especially at running down.

2:20:18.580 --> 2:20:21.100
 And I realized in trying to do this,

2:20:21.100 --> 2:20:25.020
 that there's only really two ways,

2:20:25.020 --> 2:20:26.500
 there's three possible ways of doing it,

2:20:26.500 --> 2:20:27.700
 and there's only two that work.

2:20:27.700 --> 2:20:30.460
 Either you go extremely slowly and carefully,

2:20:30.460 --> 2:20:32.460
 and you figure out, okay, there's a stone,

2:20:32.460 --> 2:20:33.820
 I'll put my foot on this stone,

2:20:33.820 --> 2:20:35.580
 and then there's another,

2:20:35.580 --> 2:20:37.100
 there's a muddy puddle I'm going to avoid.

2:20:37.100 --> 2:20:39.580
 And you know, it's slow, it's laborious.

2:20:39.580 --> 2:20:41.340
 You figure it out step by step.

2:20:42.420 --> 2:20:44.340
 Or you can just go incredibly fast,

2:20:44.340 --> 2:20:45.660
 and you don't think about it at all.

2:20:45.660 --> 2:20:47.700
 The entire conscious mind is shut out of it,

2:20:47.700 --> 2:20:49.780
 and it's probably the same playing table tennis

2:20:49.780 --> 2:20:51.340
 or something, there's something in the mind,

2:20:51.340 --> 2:20:54.260
 which is doing a whole lot of subconscious calculations

2:20:54.260 --> 2:20:55.580
 about exact, and it's amazing.

2:20:55.580 --> 2:20:58.260
 You can run at astonishing speed down a hillside

2:20:58.260 --> 2:21:00.500
 with no idea how you did it at all.

2:21:00.500 --> 2:21:01.900
 And then you panic, and you think,

2:21:01.900 --> 2:21:03.580
 I'm going to break my leg if I keep doing this,

2:21:03.580 --> 2:21:05.700
 I've got to think about where I'm going to put my foot.

2:21:05.700 --> 2:21:07.140
 So you slow down a bit and try to bring

2:21:07.140 --> 2:21:09.820
 those conscious mind in, and then you do, you crash.

2:21:09.820 --> 2:21:14.460
 You cannot think consciously while running downhill.

2:21:14.460 --> 2:21:18.500
 So it's amazing how many calculations

2:21:18.500 --> 2:21:21.380
 the mind is able to make.

2:21:21.380 --> 2:21:23.740
 And now the problem with playing chess or something,

2:21:23.740 --> 2:21:25.620
 if you're able to make all of those subconscious

2:21:25.620 --> 2:21:28.620
 kind of forward calculations about

2:21:28.620 --> 2:21:32.420
 what is the likely outcome of this move now

2:21:32.420 --> 2:21:34.740
 in the way that we can by running down a hillside

2:21:34.740 --> 2:21:38.260
 or something, it's partly about what we have adapted to do.

2:21:38.260 --> 2:21:40.500
 It's partly about the reality of the world that we're in.

2:21:40.500 --> 2:21:42.100
 Running fast downhill is something

2:21:42.100 --> 2:21:43.180
 that we better be bloody good at,

2:21:43.180 --> 2:21:44.980
 otherwise we're going to be eaten.

2:21:46.180 --> 2:21:51.100
 Whereas trying to calculate multiple, multiple moves

2:21:51.100 --> 2:21:52.620
 into the future is not something

2:21:52.620 --> 2:21:54.180
 we've ever been called on to do.

2:21:54.180 --> 2:21:55.860
 Two or three, four moves into the future

2:21:55.860 --> 2:21:58.700
 is quite enough for most of us most of the time.

2:21:58.700 --> 2:22:03.700
 Yeah, yeah, so yeah, just solving chess may not,

2:22:05.700 --> 2:22:10.180
 we may not be as far towards solving the problem

2:22:10.180 --> 2:22:14.700
 of downhill running as we might think

2:22:14.700 --> 2:22:16.300
 just because we solve chess.

2:22:17.300 --> 2:22:20.860
 Still, it's beautiful to see creativity.

2:22:20.860 --> 2:22:23.380
 Humans create machines.

2:22:23.380 --> 2:22:27.780
 They're able to create art and art on a chessboard

2:22:27.780 --> 2:22:29.420
 and art otherwise.

2:22:29.420 --> 2:22:31.780
 Who knows how far that takes us.

2:22:31.780 --> 2:22:35.300
 So I mentioned Andrej Karpathy earlier.

2:22:35.300 --> 2:22:37.340
 Him and I are big fans of yours.

2:22:37.340 --> 2:22:39.700
 If you're taking votes, his suggestion was

2:22:39.700 --> 2:22:42.580
 you should write your next book on the Fermi Paradox.

2:22:43.540 --> 2:22:47.820
 So let me ask you on the topic of alien life.

2:22:49.020 --> 2:22:50.420
 Since we've been talking about life

2:22:50.420 --> 2:22:51.980
 and we're a kind of aliens,

2:22:51.980 --> 2:22:56.980
 how many alien civilizations are out there, do you think?

2:22:58.220 --> 2:23:01.500
 Well, the universe is very big, so some,

2:23:01.500 --> 2:23:04.220
 but not as many as most people would like to think

2:23:04.220 --> 2:23:09.140
 is my view because the idea that there is a trajectory

2:23:09.140 --> 2:23:14.140
 going from simple, simple cellular life like bacteria

2:23:14.660 --> 2:23:16.260
 all the way through to humans.

2:23:17.260 --> 2:23:19.980
 It seems to me there's some big gaps along that way

2:23:19.980 --> 2:23:23.380
 that the eukaryotic cell, the complex cell that we have

2:23:23.380 --> 2:23:27.260
 is the biggest of them, but also photosynthesis is another.

2:23:27.260 --> 2:23:30.260
 The other, another interesting gap is a long gap

2:23:30.260 --> 2:23:33.140
 from the origin of the eukaryotic cell

2:23:33.140 --> 2:23:34.260
 to the first animals.

2:23:34.260 --> 2:23:37.820
 That was about a billion years, maybe more than that.

2:23:38.980 --> 2:23:41.380
 A long delay in when oxygen began

2:23:41.380 --> 2:23:42.980
 to accumulate in the atmosphere.

2:23:42.980 --> 2:23:44.740
 So from the first appearance of oxygen

2:23:44.740 --> 2:23:47.420
 in the Great Oxidation Event to enough for animals

2:23:47.420 --> 2:23:50.420
 to respire, it was close to two billion years.

2:23:52.220 --> 2:23:53.300
 Why so long?

2:23:53.300 --> 2:23:54.980
 It seems to be planetary factors.

2:23:54.980 --> 2:23:57.220
 It seems to be geology as much as in anything else.

2:23:57.220 --> 2:24:00.700
 And we don't really know what was going on.

2:24:00.700 --> 2:24:04.820
 So the idea that there's a kind of an inevitable march

2:24:04.820 --> 2:24:09.820
 towards complexity and sentient life,

2:24:10.580 --> 2:24:12.220
 I don't think is right.

2:24:12.220 --> 2:24:14.620
 Doesn't, not to say it's not gonna happen,

2:24:14.620 --> 2:24:17.700
 but I think it's not gonna happen often.

2:24:17.700 --> 2:24:19.180
 So if you think of Earth,

2:24:19.180 --> 2:24:22.900
 given the geological constraints and all that kind of stuff,

2:24:25.260 --> 2:24:28.260
 do you have a sense that life, complex life,

2:24:28.260 --> 2:24:30.420
 intelligent life happened really quickly on Earth

2:24:30.420 --> 2:24:31.740
 or really long?

2:24:31.740 --> 2:24:34.100
 So just to get a sense of,

2:24:35.180 --> 2:24:38.740
 are you more sort of saying that it's very unlikely

2:24:38.740 --> 2:24:42.300
 to get the kind of conditions required to create humans?

2:24:42.300 --> 2:24:44.900
 Or is it, even if you have the condition,

2:24:44.900 --> 2:24:46.820
 it's just statistically difficult?

2:24:46.820 --> 2:24:48.860
 I think the, I mean, the problem,

2:24:48.860 --> 2:24:51.220
 the single great problem at the center of all of that,

2:24:51.220 --> 2:24:53.340
 to my mind, is the origin of the eukaryotic cell,

2:24:53.340 --> 2:24:55.100
 which happened once and without eukaryotes,

2:24:55.100 --> 2:24:56.780
 nothing else would have happened.

2:24:56.780 --> 2:24:58.900
 And that is something that.

2:24:58.900 --> 2:25:01.060
 That's because you're saying it's super important,

2:25:01.060 --> 2:25:02.420
 the eukaryotes, but.

2:25:02.420 --> 2:25:05.700
 I'm saying a tantamount to saying that it is impossible

2:25:05.700 --> 2:25:07.740
 to build something as complex as a human being

2:25:07.740 --> 2:25:09.300
 from bacterial cells.

2:25:09.300 --> 2:25:11.900
 Totally agree in some deep fundamental way.

2:25:11.900 --> 2:25:14.780
 But it's just like a one cell going inside another.

2:25:14.780 --> 2:25:17.140
 Is that so difficult to get to work right?

2:25:17.140 --> 2:25:18.340
 That like.

2:25:18.340 --> 2:25:20.620
 Well, again, it happened once.

2:25:21.660 --> 2:25:25.260
 And if you think about, if you think,

2:25:25.260 --> 2:25:27.940
 I mean, I'm in a minority view in this position.

2:25:27.940 --> 2:25:30.580
 Most biologists probably wouldn't agree with me anyway.

2:25:30.580 --> 2:25:32.860
 But if you think about the starting point,

2:25:32.860 --> 2:25:35.740
 we've got a simple cell, it's an alkyl cell,

2:25:35.740 --> 2:25:36.860
 we can be fairly sure about that.

2:25:36.860 --> 2:25:39.220
 So it looks a lot like a bacterium,

2:25:39.220 --> 2:25:42.420
 but is in fact from this other domain of life.

2:25:42.420 --> 2:25:44.300
 So it looks a lot like a bacterial cell.

2:25:44.300 --> 2:25:46.220
 That means it doesn't have anything.

2:25:46.220 --> 2:25:47.460
 It doesn't have a nucleus.

2:25:47.460 --> 2:25:50.220
 It doesn't really have complex endomembrane.

2:25:50.220 --> 2:25:53.700
 It has a little bit of stuff, but not that much.

2:25:53.700 --> 2:25:56.220
 And it takes up an endosymbiont.

2:25:56.220 --> 2:25:58.940
 So what happens next?

2:25:58.940 --> 2:26:00.980
 And the answer is basically everything

2:26:00.980 --> 2:26:02.780
 to do with complexity.

2:26:02.780 --> 2:26:04.940
 To me, there's a beautiful paradox here.

2:26:04.940 --> 2:26:07.300
 Plants and animals and fungi

2:26:08.420 --> 2:26:10.900
 all have exactly the same type of cell.

2:26:11.900 --> 2:26:14.820
 But they all have really different ways of living.

2:26:14.820 --> 2:26:19.180
 So a plant cell, it's photosynthetic.

2:26:19.180 --> 2:26:22.180
 They started out as algae in the oceans and so on.

2:26:22.180 --> 2:26:24.700
 So think of algal blooms, single cell things.

2:26:24.700 --> 2:26:29.700
 The basic cell structure that it's built from

2:26:30.260 --> 2:26:33.780
 is exactly the same with a couple of small differences.

2:26:33.780 --> 2:26:35.140
 It's got chloroplasts as well.

2:26:35.140 --> 2:26:35.980
 It's got a vacuole.

2:26:35.980 --> 2:26:36.820
 It's got a cell wall.

2:26:36.820 --> 2:26:37.660
 But that's about it.

2:26:37.660 --> 2:26:39.580
 Pretty much everything else is exactly the same

2:26:39.580 --> 2:26:41.260
 in a plant cell and an animal cell.

2:26:42.260 --> 2:26:44.340
 And yet the ways of life are completely different.

2:26:44.340 --> 2:26:47.700
 So this cell structure did not evolve

2:26:47.700 --> 2:26:49.460
 in response to different ways of life,

2:26:49.460 --> 2:26:50.300
 different environments.

2:26:50.300 --> 2:26:51.900
 I'm in the ocean doing photosynthesis.

2:26:51.900 --> 2:26:54.780
 I'm on land running around as part of an animal.

2:26:54.780 --> 2:26:56.540
 I'm a fungus in a soil,

2:26:57.660 --> 2:27:02.220
 spreading out long shoots into whatever it may be, mycelium.

2:27:02.220 --> 2:27:05.660
 So they all have the same underlying cell structure.

2:27:05.660 --> 2:27:06.980
 Why?

2:27:06.980 --> 2:27:10.380
 Almost certainly it was driven by adaptation

2:27:10.380 --> 2:27:11.740
 to the internal environment,

2:27:11.740 --> 2:27:13.780
 to having these pesky endosymbionts

2:27:13.780 --> 2:27:16.900
 that forced all kinds of change on the host cell.

2:27:16.900 --> 2:27:18.700
 Now, in one way you could see that as a really good thing

2:27:18.700 --> 2:27:21.140
 because it may be that there's some inevitability

2:27:21.140 --> 2:27:23.260
 to this process that as soon as you got endosymbionts,

2:27:23.260 --> 2:27:25.100
 you're more or less bound to go in that direction.

2:27:25.100 --> 2:27:27.700
 Or it could be that there's a huge fluke about it

2:27:27.700 --> 2:27:29.140
 and it's almost certain to go wrong

2:27:29.140 --> 2:27:31.380
 in just about every case possible.

2:27:31.380 --> 2:27:34.180
 That the conflict will lead to effectively war

2:27:34.180 --> 2:27:36.260
 leading to death and extinction.

2:27:36.260 --> 2:27:37.980
 And it simply doesn't work out.

2:27:37.980 --> 2:27:39.420
 So maybe it happened millions of times

2:27:39.420 --> 2:27:40.620
 and it went wrong every time.

2:27:40.620 --> 2:27:43.540
 Or maybe it only happened once and it worked out

2:27:43.540 --> 2:27:44.780
 because it was inevitable.

2:27:44.780 --> 2:27:47.300
 And actually we simply do not know enough now

2:27:47.300 --> 2:27:49.180
 to say which of those two possibilities is true.

2:27:49.180 --> 2:27:50.900
 But both of them are a bit grim.

2:27:50.900 --> 2:27:54.100
 But you're leaning towards,

2:27:54.100 --> 2:27:56.740
 we just got really lucky in that one leap.

2:27:56.740 --> 2:27:59.580
 Like we got, so do you have a sense

2:27:59.580 --> 2:28:04.580
 that our galaxy, for example, has just maybe millions

2:28:04.580 --> 2:28:06.540
 of planets with bacteria living on it?

2:28:06.540 --> 2:28:09.700
 I would expect billions, tens of billions of planets

2:28:09.700 --> 2:28:11.460
 with bacteria living on it practically.

2:28:11.460 --> 2:28:16.460
 I mean, there's probably what, five to 10 planets per star

2:28:16.460 --> 2:28:18.380
 of which I would hope that at least one

2:28:18.380 --> 2:28:19.700
 would have bacteria on.

2:28:20.740 --> 2:28:23.380
 So I expect bacteria to be very common.

2:28:23.380 --> 2:28:25.620
 I simply can't put a number otherwise.

2:28:25.620 --> 2:28:27.620
 I mean, I expect it will happen elsewhere.

2:28:27.620 --> 2:28:29.660
 It's not that I think we're living

2:28:29.660 --> 2:28:31.380
 in a completely empty universe.

2:28:31.380 --> 2:28:35.620
 But I think that it's not gonna happen inevitably.

2:28:35.620 --> 2:28:37.580
 And there's something, it wasn't,

2:28:37.580 --> 2:28:41.660
 that's not the only problem with complex life on earth.

2:28:41.660 --> 2:28:44.060
 I mentioned oxygen and animals and so on as well.

2:28:44.060 --> 2:28:46.100
 And even humans, we came along very late.

2:28:46.100 --> 2:28:49.260
 You go back 5 million years and would we be that impressed

2:28:49.260 --> 2:28:52.100
 if we came across a planet full of giraffes?

2:28:52.100 --> 2:28:53.940
 I mean, you'd think, hey, there's life here

2:28:53.940 --> 2:28:56.140
 and it's a nice planet to colonize or something.

2:28:56.140 --> 2:28:58.700
 We wouldn't think, oh, let's try and have a conversation

2:28:58.700 --> 2:29:00.420
 with this giraffe.

2:29:00.420 --> 2:29:04.220
 Yeah, I'm not sure what exactly we would think.

2:29:04.220 --> 2:29:07.940
 I'm not exactly sure what makes humans so interesting

2:29:07.940 --> 2:29:11.700
 from an alien perspective or how they would notice.

2:29:11.700 --> 2:29:12.940
 I'll talk to you about cities too

2:29:12.940 --> 2:29:14.260
 because that's an interesting perspective

2:29:14.260 --> 2:29:16.720
 of how to look at human civilization.

2:29:18.180 --> 2:29:20.500
 But your sense, I mean, of course you don't know,

2:29:20.500 --> 2:29:25.420
 but it's an interesting world, it's an interesting galaxy,

2:29:25.420 --> 2:29:27.540
 it's an interesting universe to live in

2:29:27.540 --> 2:29:31.260
 that's just like every sun,

2:29:31.260 --> 2:29:36.260
 like 90% of solar systems have bacteria in it.

2:29:39.940 --> 2:29:44.940
 Imagine that world and the galaxy maybe has

2:29:46.220 --> 2:29:50.340
 just a handful if not one intelligent civilization.

2:29:51.260 --> 2:29:53.020
 That's a wild world.

2:29:53.020 --> 2:29:55.820
 I didn't even think about that world.

2:29:55.820 --> 2:29:58.820
 There's a kind of thought that,

2:29:58.820 --> 2:30:00.860
 like one of the reasons it would be so exciting

2:30:00.860 --> 2:30:04.180
 to find life on Mars or Titan or whatever

2:30:04.180 --> 2:30:05.860
 is like if its life is elsewhere,

2:30:05.860 --> 2:30:10.860
 then surely, statistically, that life,

2:30:10.980 --> 2:30:14.740
 no matter how unlikely you query as multicellular organisms,

2:30:14.740 --> 2:30:19.740
 sex, violence, what else is extremely difficult?

2:30:19.740 --> 2:30:24.740
 I mean, photosynthesis, figuring out some machinery

2:30:25.140 --> 2:30:27.500
 that involves the chemistry and the environment

2:30:27.500 --> 2:30:30.620
 to allow the building up of complex organisms,

2:30:30.620 --> 2:30:32.900
 surely that would arise.

2:30:32.900 --> 2:30:35.180
 But man, I don't know how I would feel

2:30:35.180 --> 2:30:38.100
 about just bacteria everywhere.

2:30:38.100 --> 2:30:40.700
 Well, it would be depressing if it was true.

2:30:40.700 --> 2:30:42.820
 I suppose depressing, I don't think, I don't.

2:30:42.820 --> 2:30:43.940
 I don't know what's more depressing,

2:30:43.940 --> 2:30:46.580
 bacteria everywhere or nothing everywhere.

2:30:46.580 --> 2:30:48.660
 Yes, either of them are chilling.

2:30:48.660 --> 2:30:49.980
 Yeah.

2:30:49.980 --> 2:30:51.860
 But whether it's chilling or not,

2:30:51.860 --> 2:30:55.900
 I don't think should force us to change our view

2:30:55.900 --> 2:30:57.700
 about whether it's real or not.

2:30:57.700 --> 2:30:58.540
 Yes.

2:30:58.540 --> 2:31:00.340
 And what I'm saying may or may not be true.

2:31:00.340 --> 2:31:02.940
 So how would you feel if we discovered life on Mars?

2:31:03.820 --> 2:31:04.660
 Absolutely.

2:31:04.660 --> 2:31:07.700
 It sounds like you would be less excited than some others

2:31:07.700 --> 2:31:08.940
 because you're like, well.

2:31:08.940 --> 2:31:10.420
 What I would be most interested in

2:31:10.420 --> 2:31:12.100
 is how similar to life on Earth it would be.

2:31:12.100 --> 2:31:13.900
 It would actually turn into quite a subtle problem

2:31:13.900 --> 2:31:18.900
 because the likelihood of life having gone to and fro

2:31:20.140 --> 2:31:23.980
 between Mars and the Earth is quite,

2:31:23.980 --> 2:31:27.340
 I wouldn't say high, but it's not low, it's quite feasible.

2:31:27.340 --> 2:31:29.420
 And so if we found life on Mars

2:31:29.420 --> 2:31:32.420
 and it had very similar genetic code,

2:31:32.420 --> 2:31:34.380
 but it was slightly different,

2:31:34.380 --> 2:31:36.380
 most people would interpret that immediately

2:31:36.380 --> 2:31:38.860
 as evidence that they've been transit one way or the other

2:31:38.860 --> 2:31:41.380
 and that it was a common origin of life on Mars

2:31:41.380 --> 2:31:43.460
 or on the Earth and it went one way or the other way.

2:31:43.460 --> 2:31:45.620
 The other way to see that question though would be to say,

2:31:45.620 --> 2:31:47.860
 well, actually the beginnings of life

2:31:47.860 --> 2:31:50.700
 lie in deterministic chemistry and thermodynamics,

2:31:50.700 --> 2:31:53.860
 starting with the most likely abundant materials,

2:31:53.860 --> 2:31:57.580
 CO2 and water and a wet rocky planet.

2:31:57.580 --> 2:31:59.980
 And Mars was wet and rocky at the beginning.

2:31:59.980 --> 2:32:02.100
 And will, I won't say inevitably,

2:32:02.100 --> 2:32:04.060
 but potentially almost inevitably come up

2:32:04.060 --> 2:32:06.100
 with a genetic code which is not very far away

2:32:06.100 --> 2:32:08.260
 from the genetic code that we already have.

2:32:09.540 --> 2:32:11.820
 So we see subtle differences in the genetic code.

2:32:11.820 --> 2:32:12.660
 What does it mean?

2:32:12.660 --> 2:32:14.820
 Could be very difficult to interpret.

2:32:14.820 --> 2:32:17.380
 Is it possible, do you think, to tell the difference

2:32:17.380 --> 2:32:19.980
 of something that truly originated?

2:32:19.980 --> 2:32:23.180
 I think if the stereochemistry was different,

2:32:23.180 --> 2:32:25.500
 we have sugars, for example, that are the L form

2:32:25.500 --> 2:32:30.500
 or the D form and we have D sugars and L amino acids

2:32:31.460 --> 2:32:32.940
 right across all of life.

2:32:32.940 --> 2:32:37.940
 But lipids, the bacteria have one stereoisomer

2:32:38.820 --> 2:32:42.420
 and the bacteria have the other, the opposite stereoisomer.

2:32:42.420 --> 2:32:46.460
 So it's perfectly possible to use one or the other one.

2:32:46.460 --> 2:32:48.540
 And the same would almost certainly go for,

2:32:48.540 --> 2:32:53.540
 and I think George Church has been trying to make life

2:32:53.780 --> 2:32:55.940
 based on the opposite stereoisomer.

2:32:56.820 --> 2:32:59.380
 So it's perfectly possible to do and it will work.

2:33:00.660 --> 2:33:02.380
 And if we were to find life on Mars

2:33:02.380 --> 2:33:03.940
 that was using the opposite stereoisomer,

2:33:03.940 --> 2:33:06.180
 that would be unequivocal evidence

2:33:06.180 --> 2:33:08.980
 that life had started independently there.

2:33:08.980 --> 2:33:13.340
 So hopefully the life we find will be on Titan and Europa

2:33:13.340 --> 2:33:15.660
 or something like that where it's less likely

2:33:15.660 --> 2:33:18.220
 that we shared and it's harsher conditions

2:33:18.220 --> 2:33:20.820
 so there's gonna be weirder kind of life.

2:33:20.820 --> 2:33:23.820
 I wouldn't count on that because if life started

2:33:23.820 --> 2:33:28.660
 in deep sea hydrothermal vents here, that's pretty harsh.

2:33:28.660 --> 2:33:29.940
 So Titan is different.

2:33:29.940 --> 2:33:32.060
 Europa is probably quite similar to Earth

2:33:32.060 --> 2:33:34.500
 in the sense that we're dealing with an ocean,

2:33:34.500 --> 2:33:38.820
 some acidic ocean there, as the early Earth would have been.

2:33:38.820 --> 2:33:41.380
 And it almost certainly has hydrothermal systems.

2:33:41.380 --> 2:33:43.060
 Same with Enceladus.

2:33:43.060 --> 2:33:44.940
 We can tell that from these plumes

2:33:44.940 --> 2:33:46.940
 coming from the surface through the ice.

2:33:46.940 --> 2:33:48.060
 We know there's a liquid ocean

2:33:48.060 --> 2:33:50.580
 and we can tell roughly what the chemistry is.

2:33:51.420 --> 2:33:53.660
 For Titan, we're dealing with liquid methane

2:33:53.660 --> 2:33:54.500
 and things like that.

2:33:54.500 --> 2:33:56.220
 So that would really, if there really is life there,

2:33:56.220 --> 2:33:58.020
 it would really have to be very, very different

2:33:58.020 --> 2:34:00.980
 to anything that we know on Earth.

2:34:00.980 --> 2:34:02.980
 So the hard leap, the hardest leap,

2:34:02.980 --> 2:34:07.980
 the most important leap is from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.

2:34:07.980 --> 2:34:09.500
 It's eukaryotic.

2:34:09.500 --> 2:34:12.260
 What's the second, if we're ranking?

2:34:12.260 --> 2:34:17.260
 What's the, you gave a lot of emphasis on photosynthesis.

2:34:17.460 --> 2:34:20.500
 Yeah, and that would be my second one, I think.

2:34:20.500 --> 2:34:22.620
 But it's not so much, I mean,

2:34:22.620 --> 2:34:25.220
 photosynthesis is part of the problem.

2:34:25.220 --> 2:34:26.820
 It's a difficult thing to do.

2:34:26.820 --> 2:34:29.980
 Again, we know it happened once.

2:34:29.980 --> 2:34:31.740
 We don't know why it happened once.

2:34:31.740 --> 2:34:36.740
 But the fact that it was kind of taken on board completely

2:34:39.820 --> 2:34:43.060
 by plants and algae and so on as chloroplasts

2:34:44.020 --> 2:34:47.260
 and did very well in completely different environments

2:34:47.260 --> 2:34:50.020
 and then on land and whatever else seems to suggest

2:34:50.020 --> 2:34:53.540
 that there's no problem with exploring,

2:34:53.540 --> 2:34:55.060
 whether you could have a separate origin

2:34:55.060 --> 2:34:56.780
 that explored this whole domain over there

2:34:56.780 --> 2:34:58.580
 that the bacteria had never gone into.

2:34:58.580 --> 2:35:00.900
 So that kind of says that the reason

2:35:00.900 --> 2:35:02.220
 that it only happened once is probably

2:35:02.220 --> 2:35:04.980
 because it's difficult, because the wiring is difficult.

2:35:05.980 --> 2:35:10.380
 But then it happened at least 2.2 billion years ago,

2:35:10.380 --> 2:35:14.380
 right before the GOE, maybe as long as 3 billion years ago,

2:35:14.380 --> 2:35:16.780
 when there are, some people say there are whiffs of oxygen,

2:35:16.780 --> 2:35:18.580
 there's just kind of traces in the fossil

2:35:18.580 --> 2:35:20.500
 in the geochemical record that say,

2:35:20.500 --> 2:35:22.260
 maybe there was a bit of oxygen then.

2:35:22.260 --> 2:35:23.740
 That's really disputed.

2:35:23.740 --> 2:35:25.380
 Some people say it goes all the way back

2:35:25.380 --> 2:35:28.340
 four billion years ago and then it's gone.

2:35:28.340 --> 2:35:32.460
 And the common ancestor of life on Earth was photosynthetic.

2:35:32.460 --> 2:35:34.780
 So immediately you've got groups of people

2:35:34.780 --> 2:35:37.460
 who disagree over a two billion year period of time

2:35:37.460 --> 2:35:39.620
 about when it started.

2:35:41.020 --> 2:35:45.620
 But let's take the latest date when it's unequivocal,

2:35:45.620 --> 2:35:47.380
 that's 2.2 billion years ago,

2:35:47.380 --> 2:35:49.980
 through to around about the time of the Cambrian explosion

2:35:49.980 --> 2:35:53.140
 when oxygen levels definitely got close to modern levels,

2:35:54.060 --> 2:35:56.660
 which was around about 550 million years ago.

2:35:56.660 --> 2:36:00.060
 So we've gone more than one and a half billion years

2:36:00.060 --> 2:36:01.660
 where the Earth was in stasis.

2:36:03.060 --> 2:36:04.860
 Nothing much changed.

2:36:04.860 --> 2:36:07.020
 It's known as the boring billion, in fact.

2:36:08.580 --> 2:36:10.740
 Probably stuff was, that was when eukaryotes arose

2:36:10.740 --> 2:36:12.340
 somewhere in there, but it's...

2:36:15.420 --> 2:36:17.940
 So this idea that the world is constantly changing,

2:36:17.940 --> 2:36:19.420
 that we're constantly evolving,

2:36:19.420 --> 2:36:22.020
 that we're moving up some ramp is a very human idea.

2:36:22.020 --> 2:36:27.020
 But in reality, there are kind of tipping points

2:36:30.500 --> 2:36:35.020
 to a new stable equilibrium where the cells

2:36:35.020 --> 2:36:37.540
 that are producing oxygen are precisely counterbalanced

2:36:37.540 --> 2:36:39.700
 by the cells that are consuming that oxygen,

2:36:39.700 --> 2:36:42.820
 which is why it's 21% now and has been that way

2:36:42.820 --> 2:36:44.420
 for hundreds of millions of years.

2:36:44.420 --> 2:36:46.660
 We have a very precise balance.

2:36:46.660 --> 2:36:48.820
 You go through a tipping point and you don't know

2:36:48.820 --> 2:36:51.580
 where the next stable state's gonna be,

2:36:51.580 --> 2:36:54.140
 but it can be a long way from here.

2:36:54.140 --> 2:36:57.180
 And so if we change the world with global warming,

2:36:57.180 --> 2:36:58.340
 there will be a tipping point.

2:36:58.340 --> 2:37:00.020
 The question is where and when,

2:37:00.020 --> 2:37:01.820
 and what's the next stable state?

2:37:01.820 --> 2:37:03.660
 It may be uninhabitable to us.

2:37:03.660 --> 2:37:07.020
 It'll be habitable to life, for sure.

2:37:07.020 --> 2:37:08.940
 But there may be something like the Permian extinction

2:37:08.940 --> 2:37:11.420
 where 95% of species go extinct

2:37:11.420 --> 2:37:13.900
 and there's a five to 10 million year gap

2:37:13.900 --> 2:37:16.780
 and then life recovers, but without humans.

2:37:16.780 --> 2:37:18.980
 And the question statistically, well, without humans,

2:37:18.980 --> 2:37:21.980
 but statistically does that ultimately lead

2:37:21.980 --> 2:37:24.940
 to greater complexity, more interesting life,

2:37:24.940 --> 2:37:25.780
 more intelligent life?

2:37:25.780 --> 2:37:29.700
 Well, after the first appearance of oxygen with the GOE,

2:37:29.700 --> 2:37:31.300
 there was a tipping point which led

2:37:31.300 --> 2:37:33.420
 to a longterm stable state that was equivalent

2:37:33.420 --> 2:37:36.260
 to the Black Sea today, which is to say oxygenated

2:37:36.260 --> 2:37:38.740
 at the very surface and stagnant, sterile,

2:37:38.740 --> 2:37:42.260
 not sterile, but sulfurous, lower down.

2:37:43.660 --> 2:37:47.940
 And that was stable certainly around the continental margins

2:37:47.940 --> 2:37:50.180
 for more than a billion years.

2:37:50.180 --> 2:37:52.260
 It was not a state that led to progression

2:37:52.260 --> 2:37:53.340
 in an obvious way.

2:37:55.500 --> 2:37:58.220
 Yeah, I mean, it's interesting to think about evolution,

2:37:58.220 --> 2:38:00.020
 like what leads to stable states

2:38:01.300 --> 2:38:03.900
 and how often are

2:38:05.740 --> 2:38:10.060
 evolutionary pressures emerging from the environment.

2:38:11.260 --> 2:38:13.660
 So maybe other planets are able

2:38:13.660 --> 2:38:16.340
 to create evolutionary pressures, chemical pressures,

2:38:16.340 --> 2:38:18.460
 whatever, some kind of pressure that say,

2:38:18.460 --> 2:38:20.260
 you're screwed unless you get your shit together

2:38:20.260 --> 2:38:25.260
 in the next like 10,000 years, like a lot of pressure.

2:38:26.180 --> 2:38:29.100
 It seems like Earth, like the boring building

2:38:29.100 --> 2:38:31.300
 might be explained in two ways.

2:38:31.300 --> 2:38:34.860
 One is super difficult to take any kind of next step.

2:38:34.860 --> 2:38:37.260
 And the second way it could be explained

2:38:37.260 --> 2:38:39.140
 is there's no reason to take the next step.

2:38:39.140 --> 2:38:41.860
 No, I think there is no reason, but at the end of it,

2:38:41.860 --> 2:38:44.100
 there was a snowball Earth.

2:38:44.100 --> 2:38:46.940
 So there was a planetary catastrophe on a huge scale

2:38:46.940 --> 2:38:51.940
 where the ice was, the sea was frozen at the equator.

2:38:54.220 --> 2:38:58.420
 And that forced change in one way or another.

2:38:58.420 --> 2:39:00.380
 It's not long after that, 100 million years,

2:39:00.380 --> 2:39:02.220
 perhaps after that, so not a short time,

2:39:02.220 --> 2:39:03.740
 but this is when we begin to see animals.

2:39:03.740 --> 2:39:06.620
 There was a shift again, another tipping point

2:39:06.620 --> 2:39:08.020
 that led to catastrophic change

2:39:08.020 --> 2:39:10.580
 that led to a takeoff then.

2:39:10.580 --> 2:39:13.420
 We don't really know why, but one of the reasons

2:39:13.420 --> 2:39:18.420
 why that I discuss in the book is about sulfate

2:39:19.020 --> 2:39:20.420
 being washed into the oceans,

2:39:20.420 --> 2:39:22.980
 which sounds incredibly parochial.

2:39:22.980 --> 2:39:27.500
 But the issue is, I mean, what the data is showing,

2:39:27.500 --> 2:39:30.180
 we can track roughly how oxygen was going

2:39:30.180 --> 2:39:35.180
 into the atmosphere from carbon isotopes.

2:39:35.180 --> 2:39:37.420
 So there's two main isotopes of carbon

2:39:37.420 --> 2:39:38.780
 that we need to think about here.

2:39:38.780 --> 2:39:41.980
 One is carbon 12, 99% of carbon is carbon 12.

2:39:41.980 --> 2:39:44.820
 And then 1% of carbon is carbon 13,

2:39:44.820 --> 2:39:46.060
 which is a stable isotope.

2:39:46.060 --> 2:39:48.980
 And then there's carbon 14, which is a trivial radioactive,

2:39:48.980 --> 2:39:50.820
 it's trivial in amount.

2:39:50.820 --> 2:39:53.180
 So carbon 13 is 1%.

2:39:53.180 --> 2:39:56.460
 And life and enzymes generally,

2:39:56.460 --> 2:40:00.020
 you can think of carbon atoms as little balls

2:40:00.020 --> 2:40:01.860
 bouncing around, ping pong balls bouncing around.

2:40:01.860 --> 2:40:04.340
 Carbon 12 moves a little bit faster than carbon 13

2:40:04.340 --> 2:40:06.700
 because it's lighter and it's more likely

2:40:06.700 --> 2:40:08.620
 to encounter an enzyme.

2:40:08.620 --> 2:40:11.900
 And so it's more likely to be fixed into organic matter.

2:40:11.900 --> 2:40:13.380
 And so organic matter is enriched.

2:40:13.380 --> 2:40:14.500
 And this is just an observation.

2:40:14.500 --> 2:40:17.660
 It's enriched in carbon 12 by a few percent

2:40:17.660 --> 2:40:19.060
 compared to carbon 13,

2:40:19.060 --> 2:40:21.660
 relative to what you would expect if it was just equal.

2:40:21.660 --> 2:40:26.660
 And if you then bury organic matter as coal

2:40:26.780 --> 2:40:30.260
 or oil or whatever it may be,

2:40:30.260 --> 2:40:31.580
 then it's no longer oxidized.

2:40:31.580 --> 2:40:35.180
 So some oxygen remains leftover in the atmosphere.

2:40:35.180 --> 2:40:37.460
 And that's how oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere.

2:40:37.460 --> 2:40:39.100
 And you can work out historically

2:40:39.100 --> 2:40:40.980
 how much oxygen there must've been in the atmosphere

2:40:40.980 --> 2:40:43.620
 by how much carbon was being buried.

2:40:43.620 --> 2:40:45.100
 And you think, well, how can we possibly know

2:40:45.100 --> 2:40:46.540
 how much carbon was being buried?

2:40:46.540 --> 2:40:49.340
 And the answer is, well, if you're burying carbon 12,

2:40:49.340 --> 2:40:52.100
 what you're leaving behind is more carbon 13 in the oceans

2:40:52.100 --> 2:40:54.380
 and that precipitates out into limestone.

2:40:54.380 --> 2:40:56.420
 So you can look at limestones over these ages

2:40:56.420 --> 2:40:59.140
 and work out what's the carbon 13 signal.

2:40:59.140 --> 2:41:00.980
 And that gives you a kind of a feedback

2:41:00.980 --> 2:41:03.540
 on what the oxygen content.

2:41:03.540 --> 2:41:05.180
 Right before the Cambrian explosion,

2:41:05.180 --> 2:41:08.780
 there was what's called a negative isotope anomaly excursion,

2:41:08.780 --> 2:41:10.860
 which is basically the carbon 13 goes down

2:41:10.860 --> 2:41:12.740
 by a massive amount and then back up again

2:41:12.740 --> 2:41:13.860
 10 million years later.

2:41:15.500 --> 2:41:18.980
 And what that seems to be saying is the amount

2:41:18.980 --> 2:41:23.980
 of carbon 12 in the oceans was disappearing,

2:41:26.140 --> 2:41:28.580
 which is to say it was being oxidized.

2:41:30.380 --> 2:41:33.180
 And if it's being oxidized, it's consuming oxygen.

2:41:33.180 --> 2:41:36.340
 And that should, so a big carbon 13 signal says

2:41:36.340 --> 2:41:39.940
 the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13 is really going down,

2:41:39.940 --> 2:41:42.900
 which means there's much more carbon 12

2:41:42.900 --> 2:41:44.300
 being taken out and being oxidized.

2:41:44.300 --> 2:41:46.260
 Sorry, this is getting too complex, but.

2:41:46.260 --> 2:41:49.740
 Well, it's a good way to estimate the amount of oxygen.

2:41:49.740 --> 2:41:51.580
 If you calculate the amount of oxygen

2:41:51.580 --> 2:41:53.940
 based on the assumption that all this carbon 12

2:41:53.940 --> 2:41:56.180
 that's being taken out is being oxidized by oxygen,

2:41:56.180 --> 2:41:58.060
 the answer is all the oxygen in the atmosphere

2:41:58.060 --> 2:42:00.020
 gets stripped out, there is none left.

2:42:01.100 --> 2:42:03.420
 And yet the rest of the geological indicators say,

2:42:03.420 --> 2:42:06.180
 no, there's oxygen in the atmosphere.

2:42:06.180 --> 2:42:07.620
 So it's a kind of a paradox.

2:42:07.620 --> 2:42:09.860
 And the only way to explain this paradox

2:42:09.860 --> 2:42:12.580
 just on mass balance of how much stuff is in the air,

2:42:12.580 --> 2:42:15.300
 how much stuff is in the oceans and so on,

2:42:15.300 --> 2:42:18.580
 is to assume that oxygen was not the oxygen,

2:42:18.580 --> 2:42:19.700
 it was sulfate.

2:42:19.700 --> 2:42:22.500
 Sulfate was being washed into the oceans.

2:42:22.500 --> 2:42:24.740
 It's used as an electron acceptor

2:42:24.740 --> 2:42:26.020
 by sulfate reducing bacteria,

2:42:26.020 --> 2:42:28.300
 just as we use oxygen as an electron acceptor.

2:42:28.300 --> 2:42:31.780
 So they pass their electrons to sulfate instead of oxygen.

2:42:31.780 --> 2:42:32.780
 And. Bacteria did.

2:42:32.780 --> 2:42:34.020
 Yeah, yeah.

2:42:34.020 --> 2:42:36.540
 So these are bacteria.

2:42:36.540 --> 2:42:41.300
 So they're oxidizing carbon, organic carbon with sulfate,

2:42:41.300 --> 2:42:43.340
 passing the electrons onto sulfate,

2:42:43.340 --> 2:42:47.580
 that reacts with iron to form iron pyrite or fool's gold,

2:42:47.580 --> 2:42:51.020
 sinks down to the bottom, gets buried out of the system.

2:42:51.020 --> 2:42:53.940
 And this can account for the mass balance.

2:42:53.940 --> 2:42:55.620
 So why does it matter?

2:42:55.620 --> 2:42:58.020
 It matters because what it says is

2:42:58.020 --> 2:43:00.020
 there was a chance event,

2:43:00.020 --> 2:43:03.220
 tectonically there was a lot of sulfate sitting on land

2:43:03.220 --> 2:43:06.580
 as some kind of mineral.

2:43:06.580 --> 2:43:10.340
 So calcium sulfate minerals, for example, are evaporitic.

2:43:11.300 --> 2:43:13.860
 And because there happened to be

2:43:13.860 --> 2:43:18.340
 some continental collisions, mountain building,

2:43:18.340 --> 2:43:20.820
 the sulfate was pushed up the side of a mountain

2:43:20.820 --> 2:43:22.820
 and happened to get washed into the ocean.

2:43:24.140 --> 2:43:26.460
 Yeah, so I wonder how many happy accidents

2:43:26.460 --> 2:43:27.420
 like that are possible.

2:43:27.420 --> 2:43:28.780
 Statistically, it's really hard.

2:43:28.780 --> 2:43:30.820
 Maybe you can rule that in statistically,

2:43:30.820 --> 2:43:34.100
 but this is the course of life on earth.

2:43:34.100 --> 2:43:36.460
 Without all that sulfate being raised up,

2:43:36.460 --> 2:43:38.140
 this Cambrian explosion almost certainly

2:43:38.140 --> 2:43:39.820
 would not have happened.

2:43:39.820 --> 2:43:42.300
 And then we wouldn't have had animals and so on and so on.

2:43:42.300 --> 2:43:46.860
 So it's this kind of explanation of the Cambrian explosion.

2:43:48.100 --> 2:43:51.900
 So let me actually say in several ways.

2:43:51.900 --> 2:43:55.900
 So folks who challenge the validity

2:43:55.900 --> 2:44:00.900
 of the theory of evolution will give us an example.

2:44:00.940 --> 2:44:02.620
 Now I'm not well studied in this,

2:44:02.620 --> 2:44:04.820
 but will give us an example of the Cambrian explosion

2:44:04.820 --> 2:44:06.660
 as like, this thing is weird.

2:44:07.460 --> 2:44:08.900
 Oh, it is weird, yeah.

2:44:08.900 --> 2:44:13.740
 So the question I would have is

2:44:13.740 --> 2:44:17.260
 what's the biggest mystery or gap in understanding

2:44:17.260 --> 2:44:18.540
 about evolution?

2:44:19.420 --> 2:44:21.140
 Is it the Cambrian explosion?

2:44:21.140 --> 2:44:23.580
 And if so, what's our best understanding

2:44:23.580 --> 2:44:27.020
 of how to explain, first of all, what is it?

2:44:28.340 --> 2:44:30.940
 In my understanding, in the short amount of time,

2:44:30.940 --> 2:44:32.660
 maybe 10 million years, 100 million years,

2:44:32.660 --> 2:44:35.780
 something like that, a huge number of animals,

2:44:35.780 --> 2:44:38.580
 a variety, diversity of animals were created.

2:44:39.820 --> 2:44:41.980
 Anyway, there's like five questions in there.

2:44:41.980 --> 2:44:43.220
 Is that the biggest mystery?

2:44:43.220 --> 2:44:45.380
 No, I don't think it's a particularly big mystery

2:44:45.380 --> 2:44:46.220
 really anymore.

2:44:48.660 --> 2:44:51.220
 There are still mysteries about why then.

2:44:51.220 --> 2:44:52.860
 And I've just said sulfate being washed

2:44:52.860 --> 2:44:54.060
 into the oceans is one.

2:44:54.060 --> 2:44:57.940
 It needs oxygen and oxygen levels rose around that time.

2:44:59.180 --> 2:45:01.660
 So probably before that, they weren't high enough

2:45:01.660 --> 2:45:02.940
 for animals.

2:45:02.940 --> 2:45:04.660
 What we're seeing with the Cambrian explosion

2:45:04.660 --> 2:45:07.860
 is the beginning of predators and prey relationships.

2:45:07.860 --> 2:45:12.820
 We're seeing modern ecosystems and we're seeing arms races

2:45:12.820 --> 2:45:17.820
 and we're seeing the full creativity of evolution unleashed.

2:45:20.380 --> 2:45:22.540
 So I talked about the boring billion,

2:45:22.540 --> 2:45:26.340
 nothing happens for one and a half billion years,

2:45:26.340 --> 2:45:27.740
 one and a half billion years.

2:45:29.500 --> 2:45:31.780
 The assumption, and this is completely wrong,

2:45:31.780 --> 2:45:36.180
 this assumption, is then that evolution works really slowly

2:45:36.180 --> 2:45:37.980
 and that you need billions of years

2:45:37.980 --> 2:45:40.660
 to affect some small change

2:45:40.660 --> 2:45:42.900
 and then another billion years to do something else.

2:45:42.900 --> 2:45:44.660
 It's completely wrong.

2:45:44.660 --> 2:45:47.180
 Evolution gets stuck in a stasis and it stays that way

2:45:47.180 --> 2:45:50.140
 for tens of millions, hundreds of millions of years.

2:45:50.140 --> 2:45:52.500
 And Steven Jay Gould used to argue this,

2:45:52.500 --> 2:45:53.940
 he called it punctuated equilibrium,

2:45:53.940 --> 2:45:55.500
 but he was doing it to do with animals

2:45:55.500 --> 2:45:58.660
 and to do with the last 500 million years or so,

2:45:58.660 --> 2:46:00.020
 where it's much less obvious

2:46:00.020 --> 2:46:02.740
 than if you think about the entire planetary history.

2:46:02.740 --> 2:46:04.780
 And then you realize that the first two billion years

2:46:04.780 --> 2:46:06.540
 was bacteria only.

2:46:06.540 --> 2:46:07.780
 You have the origin of life,

2:46:07.780 --> 2:46:09.780
 two billion years of just bacteria,

2:46:09.780 --> 2:46:11.900
 oxygen photosynthesis arising here.

2:46:11.900 --> 2:46:14.300
 Then you have a global catastrophe,

2:46:14.300 --> 2:46:16.420
 snowball earths and great oxidation event

2:46:16.420 --> 2:46:18.220
 and then another billion years of nothing happening

2:46:18.220 --> 2:46:20.420
 and then some period of upheavals

2:46:20.420 --> 2:46:21.660
 and then another snowball earth

2:46:21.660 --> 2:46:23.540
 and then suddenly you see the Cambrian explosion.

2:46:23.540 --> 2:46:25.860
 This is long periods of stasis

2:46:25.860 --> 2:46:27.700
 where the world is in a stable state

2:46:27.700 --> 2:46:31.060
 and is not geared towards increasing complexity.

2:46:31.060 --> 2:46:33.460
 It's just everything is in balance.

2:46:33.460 --> 2:46:35.580
 And only when you have a catastrophic level,

2:46:35.580 --> 2:46:38.660
 global level problem like a snowball earth,

2:46:38.660 --> 2:46:40.300
 it forces everything out of balance

2:46:40.300 --> 2:46:42.620
 and there's a tipping point and you end up somewhere else.

2:46:42.620 --> 2:46:48.420
 Now, the idea that evolution is slow is wrong.

2:46:48.420 --> 2:46:50.340
 It can be incredibly fast.

2:46:50.340 --> 2:46:52.980
 And I mentioned earlier on that you can,

2:46:52.980 --> 2:46:54.980
 in theory, it would take half a million years

2:46:54.980 --> 2:46:57.940
 to invent an eye, for example, from a light sensitive spot.

2:46:57.940 --> 2:47:00.580
 It doesn't take long to convert

2:47:01.980 --> 2:47:05.540
 one kind of tube into a tube with nobbles on it

2:47:05.540 --> 2:47:08.700
 into a tube with arms on it and then multiple arms

2:47:08.700 --> 2:47:10.340
 and then at one end is the head

2:47:10.340 --> 2:47:11.700
 where it starts out as a swelling.

2:47:11.700 --> 2:47:15.220
 It's not difficult intellectually to understand

2:47:15.220 --> 2:47:18.300
 how these things can happen.

2:47:18.300 --> 2:47:20.980
 It boggles the mind that it can happen so quickly,

2:47:20.980 --> 2:47:24.780
 but we're used to human timescales.

2:47:24.780 --> 2:47:27.300
 And what we need to talk about is generations of things

2:47:27.300 --> 2:47:30.500
 that live for a year in the ocean.

2:47:30.500 --> 2:47:33.300
 And then a million years is a million generations.

2:47:33.300 --> 2:47:35.940
 And the amount of change that you can do,

2:47:35.940 --> 2:47:38.980
 it can affect in that period of time is enormous.

2:47:38.980 --> 2:47:41.020
 And we're dealing with large populations of things

2:47:41.020 --> 2:47:44.060
 where selection is sensitive to pretty small changes

2:47:44.060 --> 2:47:47.540
 and can, so again, as soon as you throw in

2:47:48.380 --> 2:47:50.860
 the competition of predators and prey

2:47:50.860 --> 2:47:53.820
 and you're ramping up the scale of evolution,

2:47:53.820 --> 2:47:56.180
 it's not very surprising that it happens very quickly

2:47:56.180 --> 2:47:58.700
 when the environment allows it to happen.

2:47:58.700 --> 2:47:59.940
 So I don't think there's a big mystery.

2:47:59.940 --> 2:48:03.460
 There's lots of details that need to be filled in.

2:48:03.460 --> 2:48:11.340
 I mean, the big mystery in biology is consciousness.

2:48:11.340 --> 2:48:13.380
 The big mystery in biology is consciousness.

2:48:13.380 --> 2:48:21.420
 Well, intelligence is kind of a mystery too.

2:48:21.420 --> 2:48:28.100
 I mean, you said biology, not psychology.

2:48:28.100 --> 2:48:30.580
 Because from a biology perspective,

2:48:30.580 --> 2:48:32.380
 it seems like intelligence and consciousness

2:48:32.380 --> 2:48:37.660
 all are the same, like weird, like all the brain stuff.

2:48:37.660 --> 2:48:41.780
 I don't see intelligence as necessarily that difficult,

2:48:41.780 --> 2:48:42.620
 I suppose.

2:48:42.620 --> 2:48:44.740
 I mean, I see it as a form of computing

2:48:44.740 --> 2:48:48.460
 and I don't know much about computing, so I...

2:48:48.460 --> 2:48:50.220
 You don't know much about consciousness either.

2:48:50.220 --> 2:48:54.340
 So I mean, I suppose, oh, I see.

2:48:54.340 --> 2:48:57.500
 I see, I see, I see, I see.

2:48:57.500 --> 2:49:00.300
 That consciousness you do know a lot about as a human being.

2:49:00.300 --> 2:49:04.580
 No, no, I mean, I think I can understand the wiring

2:49:04.580 --> 2:49:08.300
 of a brain as a series of, in pretty much the same way

2:49:08.300 --> 2:49:16.700
 as a computer in theory, in terms of the circuitry of it.

2:49:16.700 --> 2:49:21.780
 The mystery to me is how this system gives rise to feelings,

2:49:21.780 --> 2:49:23.140
 as we were talking about earlier on.

2:49:23.140 --> 2:49:27.820
 Yeah, I just, I think we oversimplify intelligence.

2:49:27.820 --> 2:49:31.860
 I think the dance, the magic of reasoning

2:49:31.860 --> 2:49:36.140
 is as interesting as the magic of feeling.

2:49:36.140 --> 2:49:42.500
 We tend to think of reasoning as like very,

2:49:42.500 --> 2:49:45.380
 running a very simplistic algorithm.

2:49:45.380 --> 2:49:48.780
 I think reasoning is the interplay between memory,

2:49:48.780 --> 2:49:51.900
 whatever the hell is going on, the unconscious mind,

2:49:51.900 --> 2:49:55.100
 all of that.

2:49:55.100 --> 2:49:58.460
 I'm not trying to diminish it in any way at all.

2:49:58.460 --> 2:50:01.900
 Obviously, it's extraordinarily exquisitely complex,

2:50:01.900 --> 2:50:06.860
 but I don't see a logical difficulty with how it works.

2:50:06.860 --> 2:50:11.540
 Yeah, no, I mean, I agree with you, but sometimes, yeah,

2:50:11.540 --> 2:50:16.340
 there's a big cloak of mystery around consciousness.

2:50:16.340 --> 2:50:20.020
 Let me compare it with classical versus quantum physics.

2:50:20.020 --> 2:50:26.580
 Classical physics is logical, and you can understand the kind

2:50:26.580 --> 2:50:27.860
 of language we're dealing with.

2:50:27.860 --> 2:50:29.540
 It's almost at the human level, we're

2:50:29.540 --> 2:50:31.460
 dealing with stars and things that we can see.

2:50:31.460 --> 2:50:34.500
 And when you get to quantum mechanics and things,

2:50:34.500 --> 2:50:36.820
 it's practically impossible for the human mind

2:50:36.820 --> 2:50:39.580
 to compute what just happened there.

2:50:39.580 --> 2:50:41.940
 Yeah, I mean, that is the same.

2:50:41.940 --> 2:50:44.940
 It's like, you understand mathematically

2:50:44.940 --> 2:50:49.060
 that the notes of a musical composition, that's intelligence.

2:50:49.060 --> 2:50:54.900
 But why it makes you feel a certain way,

2:50:54.900 --> 2:50:57.620
 that is much harder to understand.

2:50:57.620 --> 2:51:02.660
 Yeah, that's really, but it was interesting framing

2:51:02.660 --> 2:51:05.580
 that that's a mystery at the core of biology.

2:51:05.580 --> 2:51:09.740
 I wonder who solves consciousness.

2:51:09.740 --> 2:51:11.340
 I tend to think consciousness will

2:51:11.340 --> 2:51:15.780
 be solved by the engineer, meaning the person who builds

2:51:15.780 --> 2:51:20.260
 it, who keeps trying to build the thing,

2:51:20.260 --> 2:51:24.900
 versus biology, such a complicated system.

2:51:24.900 --> 2:51:29.900
 I feel like the building blocks of consciousness

2:51:29.900 --> 2:51:34.140
 from a biological perspective are like,

2:51:34.140 --> 2:51:36.900
 that's like the final creation of a human being.

2:51:36.900 --> 2:51:38.980
 So you have to understand the whole damn thing.

2:51:38.980 --> 2:51:42.220
 You said the electrical field, but like,

2:51:42.220 --> 2:51:43.820
 electrical field is plus plus.

2:51:43.820 --> 2:51:47.220
 Everything, the whole shebang.

2:51:47.220 --> 2:51:48.340
 I'm inclined to agree.

2:51:48.340 --> 2:51:51.860
 I mean, my feeling is from my meager knowledge

2:51:51.860 --> 2:51:53.900
 of the history of science is that the biggest breakthrough

2:51:53.900 --> 2:51:57.780
 has usually come through from a field that was not related.

2:51:57.780 --> 2:52:00.060
 So if anyone is not going to be a biologist who

2:52:00.060 --> 2:52:03.020
 solves consciousness, just because biologists

2:52:03.020 --> 2:52:06.740
 are too embedded in the nature of the problem.

2:52:06.740 --> 2:52:09.020
 And then nobody's going to believe you when you've done it,

2:52:09.020 --> 2:52:12.220
 because nobody's going to be able to prove that this AI is

2:52:12.220 --> 2:52:16.140
 in fact conscious and sad in any case,

2:52:16.140 --> 2:52:18.260
 and any more than you can prove that a dog is

2:52:18.260 --> 2:52:20.140
 conscious and sad.

2:52:20.140 --> 2:52:23.220
 So it tells you that it is in good language,

2:52:23.220 --> 2:52:24.820
 and you must believe it.

2:52:24.820 --> 2:52:27.460
 But I think most people will accept,

2:52:27.460 --> 2:52:30.820
 if faced with that, that that's what it is.

2:52:30.820 --> 2:52:38.980
 All of this probability of complex life,

2:52:38.980 --> 2:52:45.620
 in one way, I think why it matters is that my expectation,

2:52:45.620 --> 2:52:49.540
 I suppose, is that we will be over the next 100 years

2:52:49.540 --> 2:52:53.340
 or so, if we survive at all, that AI will increasingly

2:52:53.340 --> 2:52:53.980
 dominate.

2:52:53.980 --> 2:52:56.020
 And pretty much anything that we put out

2:52:56.020 --> 2:53:00.220
 into space looking for other, well, for the universe,

2:53:00.220 --> 2:53:03.700
 for what's out there, will be AI, won't be us.

2:53:03.700 --> 2:53:04.700
 We won't be doing that.

2:53:04.700 --> 2:53:07.420
 Or when we do, it'll be on a much more limited scale.

2:53:07.420 --> 2:53:12.500
 I suppose the same would apply to any alien civilization.

2:53:12.500 --> 2:53:15.380
 So perhaps rather than looking for signs of life out there,

2:53:15.380 --> 2:53:19.100
 we should be looking for AI out there.

2:53:19.100 --> 2:53:25.060
 But then we face the problem that I

2:53:25.060 --> 2:53:29.980
 don't see how a planet is going to give rise directly to AI.

2:53:29.980 --> 2:53:34.140
 I can see how a planet can give rise directly to organic life.

2:53:34.140 --> 2:53:36.900
 And if the principles that govern the evolution of life

2:53:36.900 --> 2:53:40.020
 on Earth apply to other planets as well,

2:53:40.020 --> 2:53:43.780
 and I think a lot of them would, then

2:53:43.780 --> 2:53:47.660
 the likelihood of ending up with a humanlike civilization

2:53:47.660 --> 2:53:50.500
 capable of giving rise to AI in the first place

2:53:50.500 --> 2:53:52.100
 is massively limited.

2:53:52.100 --> 2:53:54.100
 Once you've done it once, perhaps it takes over

2:53:54.100 --> 2:53:57.300
 the universe, and maybe there's no issue.

2:53:57.300 --> 2:54:01.060
 But it seems to me that the two are necessarily linked,

2:54:01.060 --> 2:54:03.980
 that you're not going to just turn a sterile planet

2:54:03.980 --> 2:54:07.740
 into an AI life form without the intermediary of the organics

2:54:07.740 --> 2:54:08.380
 first.

2:54:08.380 --> 2:54:13.180
 So you have to run the full evolutionary computation

2:54:13.180 --> 2:54:15.420
 with the organics to create AI.

2:54:15.420 --> 2:54:18.820
 How does AI bootstrap itself up without the aid, if you like,

2:54:18.820 --> 2:54:20.540
 of an intelligent designer?

2:54:20.540 --> 2:54:23.620
 The origin of AI is going to have

2:54:23.620 --> 2:54:27.700
 to be in the chemistry of a planet.

2:54:27.700 --> 2:54:29.980
 But that's not a limiting factor, right?

2:54:29.980 --> 2:54:35.500
 So let me ask the Fermi paradox question.

2:54:35.500 --> 2:54:40.420
 Let's say we live in this incredibly dark and beautiful

2:54:40.420 --> 2:54:47.020
 world of just billions of planets with bacteria on it

2:54:47.020 --> 2:54:49.220
 and very few intelligent civilizations,

2:54:49.220 --> 2:54:52.620
 and yet there's a few out there.

2:54:52.620 --> 2:54:58.060
 Why haven't we, at scale, seen them visit us?

2:54:58.060 --> 2:54:59.860
 What's your sense?

2:54:59.860 --> 2:55:02.460
 Is it because they don't exist?

2:55:02.460 --> 2:55:04.700
 Well, don't exist in the right part of the universe

2:55:04.700 --> 2:55:05.420
 at the right time.

2:55:05.420 --> 2:55:08.260
 That's the simplest answer for it.

2:55:08.260 --> 2:55:10.380
 Is that the one you find the most compelling,

2:55:10.380 --> 2:55:13.860
 or is there some other explanation?

2:55:13.860 --> 2:55:16.820
 I find that, no, it's not that I find it more compelling.

2:55:16.820 --> 2:55:19.380
 It's that I find more probable.

2:55:19.380 --> 2:55:21.580
 And I find all of them, I mean, there's

2:55:21.580 --> 2:55:22.580
 a lot of handwaving in this.

2:55:22.580 --> 2:55:24.300
 We just don't know.

2:55:24.300 --> 2:55:27.900
 So I'm trying to read out from what I know about life on Earth

2:55:27.900 --> 2:55:30.420
 to what might happen somewhere else.

2:55:30.420 --> 2:55:33.540
 And it gives, to my mind, a bit of a pessimistic view

2:55:33.540 --> 2:55:37.380
 of bacteria everywhere and only occasional intelligent life

2:55:37.380 --> 2:55:41.580
 and running forward humans only once on Earth and nothing else

2:55:41.580 --> 2:55:44.740
 that you would necessarily be any more excited about making

2:55:44.740 --> 2:55:47.020
 contact with than you would be making contact with them

2:55:47.020 --> 2:55:49.140
 on Earth.

2:55:49.140 --> 2:55:52.460
 So I think the chances are pretty limited.

2:55:52.460 --> 2:55:56.700
 And the chances of us surviving are pretty limited, too,

2:55:56.700 --> 2:55:58.460
 in the way we're going on at the moment.

2:55:58.460 --> 2:56:01.020
 The likelihood of us not making ourselves extinct

2:56:01.020 --> 2:56:03.900
 within the next few hundred years,

2:56:03.900 --> 2:56:08.140
 possibly within the next 50 or 100 years, seems quite small.

2:56:08.140 --> 2:56:11.180
 I hope we can do better than that.

2:56:11.180 --> 2:56:13.340
 So maybe the only thing that will survive from humanity

2:56:13.340 --> 2:56:14.140
 will be AI.

2:56:14.140 --> 2:56:15.900
 And maybe AI, once it exists and once

2:56:15.900 --> 2:56:19.780
 it's capable of effectively copying itself and cutting

2:56:19.780 --> 2:56:22.740
 humans out of the loop, then maybe that

2:56:22.740 --> 2:56:24.500
 will take over the universe.

2:56:24.500 --> 2:56:26.500
 I mean, there's a kind of inherent sadness

2:56:26.500 --> 2:56:28.020
 to the way you described that.

2:56:28.020 --> 2:56:31.820
 But isn't that also potentially beautiful,

2:56:31.820 --> 2:56:37.940
 that that's the next step of life, I suppose,

2:56:37.940 --> 2:56:39.940
 from your perspective, as long as it carries the flame

2:56:39.940 --> 2:56:41.340
 of consciousness somehow?

2:56:41.340 --> 2:56:43.180
 No, I think, yes, there can be some beauty to it

2:56:43.180 --> 2:56:44.500
 being the next step of life.

2:56:44.500 --> 2:56:46.500
 And I don't know if consciousness matters or not,

2:56:46.500 --> 2:56:49.660
 from that point of view, to be honest with you.

2:56:49.660 --> 2:56:50.380
 Yeah.

2:56:50.380 --> 2:56:53.180
 But there's some sadness, yes, probably,

2:56:53.180 --> 2:56:58.140
 because I think it comes down to the selfishness

2:56:58.140 --> 2:56:59.740
 that we were talking about earlier on.

2:56:59.740 --> 2:57:03.860
 I am an individual with a desire not

2:57:03.860 --> 2:57:06.460
 to be displaced from life.

2:57:06.460 --> 2:57:07.620
 I want to stay alive.

2:57:07.620 --> 2:57:11.540
 I want to be here.

2:57:11.540 --> 2:57:13.700
 So I suppose the threat that a lot of people would feel

2:57:13.700 --> 2:57:15.300
 is that we will just be wiped out,

2:57:15.300 --> 2:57:20.180
 so that there will be potential conflict between AI and humans

2:57:20.180 --> 2:57:25.340
 and that AI will win because it's a lot smarter.

2:57:25.340 --> 2:57:27.900
 Boy, would that be a sad state of affairs

2:57:27.900 --> 2:57:32.500
 if consciousness is just an intermediate stage

2:57:32.500 --> 2:57:36.740
 between bacteria and AI, right?

2:57:36.740 --> 2:57:38.820
 Well, I would see bacteria as being potentially

2:57:38.820 --> 2:57:41.020
 a kind of primitive form of consciousness anyway.

2:57:41.020 --> 2:57:43.940
 So the whole of life on Earth, to my mind,

2:57:43.940 --> 2:57:46.580
 is capable of some form of feelings

2:57:46.580 --> 2:57:47.860
 in response to the environment.

2:57:47.860 --> 2:57:49.320
 That's not to say it's intelligent,

2:57:49.320 --> 2:57:52.580
 it's got its own algorithms for intelligence,

2:57:52.580 --> 2:57:55.220
 but nothing comparable with us.

2:57:55.220 --> 2:57:57.740
 I think it's beautiful what a planet, what a sterile planet,

2:57:57.740 --> 2:57:59.180
 can come up with.

2:57:59.180 --> 2:58:01.820
 It's astonishing that it's come up with all of this stuff

2:58:01.820 --> 2:58:06.740
 that we see around us and that either we or whatever we

2:58:06.740 --> 2:58:12.340
 produce is capable of destroying all of that is a sad thought.

2:58:12.340 --> 2:58:17.540
 But it's also hugely pessimistic.

2:58:17.540 --> 2:58:19.780
 I'd like to think that we're capable of giving rise

2:58:19.780 --> 2:58:21.620
 to something which is at least as good,

2:58:21.620 --> 2:58:24.140
 if not better than us, as AI.

2:58:24.140 --> 2:58:29.860
 Yeah, I have that same optimism, especially a thing

2:58:29.860 --> 2:58:31.860
 that is able to propagate throughout the universe

2:58:31.860 --> 2:58:33.820
 more efficiently than humans can.

2:58:33.820 --> 2:58:39.140
 Or extensions of humans, some merger with AI and humans,

2:58:39.140 --> 2:58:43.900
 whether that comes from bioengineering of the human body

2:58:43.900 --> 2:58:47.860
 to extend its life somehow, to carry

2:58:47.860 --> 2:58:50.180
 that flame of consciousness and that personality

2:58:50.180 --> 2:58:54.500
 and the beautiful tension that's within all of us,

2:58:54.500 --> 2:58:56.620
 carry that through to multiple planets,

2:58:56.620 --> 2:58:59.620
 to multiple solar systems, all out there in the universe.

2:58:59.620 --> 2:59:02.100
 I mean, that's a beautiful vision.

2:59:02.100 --> 2:59:07.700
 Whether AI can do that or bioengineered humans can,

2:59:07.700 --> 2:59:09.100
 that's an exciting possibility.

2:59:09.100 --> 2:59:13.300
 And especially meeting other alien civilizations

2:59:13.300 --> 2:59:14.620
 in that same kind of way.

2:59:14.620 --> 2:59:16.780
 Do you think aliens have consciousness?

2:59:16.780 --> 2:59:18.300
 If they're organic.

2:59:18.300 --> 2:59:20.500
 So organic is connected to consciousness.

2:59:20.500 --> 2:59:24.340
 I mean, I think any system which is going to bootstrap itself

2:59:24.340 --> 2:59:30.260
 up from planetary origins, I mean, let me finish this

2:59:30.260 --> 2:59:31.620
 and then come on to something else.

2:59:31.620 --> 2:59:34.260
 But from planetary origins is going

2:59:34.260 --> 2:59:36.020
 to face similar constraints.

2:59:36.020 --> 2:59:37.940
 And those constraints are going to be addressed

2:59:37.940 --> 2:59:40.260
 in similar basic engineering ways.

2:59:40.260 --> 2:59:41.740
 And I think it will be cellular.

2:59:41.740 --> 2:59:43.860
 And I think it will have electrical charges.

2:59:43.860 --> 2:59:46.340
 And I think it will have to be selected

2:59:46.340 --> 2:59:47.620
 in populations over time.

2:59:47.620 --> 2:59:48.820
 And all of these things will tend

2:59:48.820 --> 2:59:50.340
 to give rise to the same processes

2:59:50.340 --> 2:59:53.260
 as the simplest fix to a difficult problem.

2:59:53.260 --> 2:59:54.940
 So I would expect it to be conscious, yes.

2:59:54.940 --> 2:59:57.660
 And I would expect it to resemble life

2:59:57.660 --> 3:00:00.580
 on Earth in many ways.

3:00:00.580 --> 3:00:03.140
 When I was about, I guess, 15 or 16,

3:00:03.140 --> 3:00:06.580
 I remember reading a book by Fred Hoyle

3:00:06.580 --> 3:00:10.980
 called The Black Cloud, which I was a budding biologist

3:00:10.980 --> 3:00:11.460
 at the time.

3:00:11.460 --> 3:00:13.940
 And this was the first time I'd come across someone really

3:00:13.940 --> 3:00:16.660
 challenging the heart of biology and saying,

3:00:16.660 --> 3:00:18.740
 you are far too parochial.

3:00:18.740 --> 3:00:20.940
 You're thinking about life as carbon based.

3:00:20.940 --> 3:00:26.500
 Here's a life form which is kind of dust, interstellar dust

3:00:26.500 --> 3:00:27.740
 on a solar system scale.

3:00:30.260 --> 3:00:32.500
 And it's a novel.

3:00:32.500 --> 3:00:34.380
 But I felt enormously challenged by that novel

3:00:34.380 --> 3:00:39.980
 because it hadn't occurred to me how limited my thinking was,

3:00:39.980 --> 3:00:43.380
 how narrow minded I was being.

3:00:43.380 --> 3:00:46.140
 And here was a great physicist with a completely different

3:00:46.140 --> 3:00:48.140
 conception of what life could be.

3:00:48.140 --> 3:00:51.540
 And since then, I've seen him attacked in various ways.

3:00:51.540 --> 3:00:55.780
 And I'm kind of reluctant to say the attacks make more sense

3:00:55.780 --> 3:00:58.820
 to me than the original story, which

3:00:58.820 --> 3:01:02.940
 is to say, even in terms of information processing,

3:01:02.940 --> 3:01:04.280
 if you're on that scale and there's

3:01:04.280 --> 3:01:06.580
 a limit to the speed of light, how quickly can something

3:01:06.580 --> 3:01:10.900
 think if you're needing to broadcast

3:01:10.900 --> 3:01:16.860
 across the solar system, it's going to be slow.

3:01:16.860 --> 3:01:19.060
 It's not going to hold a conversation with you

3:01:19.060 --> 3:01:22.500
 on the kind of timelines that Fred Hoyle was imagining,

3:01:22.500 --> 3:01:25.420
 at least not by any easy way of doing it,

3:01:25.420 --> 3:01:28.940
 assuming that the speed of light is a limit.

3:01:28.940 --> 3:01:32.580
 And then again, you really can't.

3:01:32.580 --> 3:01:34.940
 This is something Richard Dawkins argued long ago.

3:01:34.940 --> 3:01:36.300
 And I do think he's right.

3:01:36.300 --> 3:01:39.020
 There is no other way to generate

3:01:39.020 --> 3:01:41.300
 this level of complexity than natural selection.

3:01:41.300 --> 3:01:42.620
 Nothing else can do it.

3:01:42.620 --> 3:01:44.780
 You need populations.

3:01:44.780 --> 3:01:46.380
 And you need selection in populations

3:01:46.380 --> 3:01:53.140
 and a kind of an isolated interstellar cloud.

3:01:53.140 --> 3:01:55.300
 Again, there's unlimited time.

3:01:55.300 --> 3:01:57.180
 And maybe there's no problems with distance.

3:01:57.180 --> 3:02:03.780
 But you need to have a certain frequency of generational time

3:02:03.780 --> 3:02:07.620
 to generate a serious level of complexity.

3:02:07.620 --> 3:02:11.900
 And I just have a feeling it's never going to work.

3:02:11.900 --> 3:02:15.540
 Well, as far as we know, so natural selection and evolution

3:02:15.540 --> 3:02:17.460
 is really a powerful tool here on Earth.

3:02:17.460 --> 3:02:19.020
 But there could be other mechanisms.

3:02:19.020 --> 3:02:24.540
 So I don't know if you're familiar with cellular automata,

3:02:24.540 --> 3:02:29.140
 but complex systems that have really simple components

3:02:29.140 --> 3:02:31.500
 and seemingly move based on simple rules

3:02:31.500 --> 3:02:34.660
 when they're taken as a whole, really interesting complexity

3:02:34.660 --> 3:02:36.180
 emerges.

3:02:36.180 --> 3:02:38.980
 I don't know what the pressures on that are.

3:02:38.980 --> 3:02:41.460
 It's not really selection, but interesting complexity

3:02:41.460 --> 3:02:42.740
 seems to emerge.

3:02:42.740 --> 3:02:46.340
 And that's not well understood exactly why that complexity

3:02:46.340 --> 3:02:46.860
 emerges.

3:02:46.860 --> 3:02:48.980
 I think there's a difference between complexity

3:02:48.980 --> 3:02:51.060
 and evolution.

3:02:51.060 --> 3:02:53.300
 So some of the work we're doing on the origin of life

3:02:53.300 --> 3:02:59.180
 is thinking about how do genes arise?

3:02:59.180 --> 3:03:01.740
 How does information arise in biology?

3:03:01.740 --> 3:03:03.860
 And thinking about it from the point of view

3:03:03.860 --> 3:03:06.300
 of reacting CO2 with hydrogen, what do you get?

3:03:06.300 --> 3:03:08.980
 Well, what you're going to get is carboxylic acids, then

3:03:08.980 --> 3:03:09.700
 amino acids.

3:03:09.700 --> 3:03:13.020
 It's quite hard to make nucleotides.

3:03:13.020 --> 3:03:15.820
 And it's possible to make them, and it's been done,

3:03:15.820 --> 3:03:18.300
 and it's been done following this pathway as well.

3:03:18.300 --> 3:03:20.140
 But you make trace amounts.

3:03:20.140 --> 3:03:21.780
 And so the next question, assuming

3:03:21.780 --> 3:03:24.220
 that this is the right way of seeing the question, which

3:03:24.220 --> 3:03:26.580
 maybe it's just not, but let's assume it is,

3:03:26.580 --> 3:03:29.460
 is, well, how do you reliably make more nucleotides?

3:03:29.460 --> 3:03:32.860
 And how do you become more complex and better at becoming

3:03:32.860 --> 3:03:35.140
 a nucleotide generating machine?

3:03:35.140 --> 3:03:38.420
 And the answer is, well, you need positive feedback loops,

3:03:38.420 --> 3:03:40.260
 some form of autocatalysis.

3:03:40.260 --> 3:03:43.060
 So that can work, and we know it happens in biology.

3:03:43.060 --> 3:03:48.260
 If this nucleotide, for example, catalyzes CO2 fixation,

3:03:48.260 --> 3:03:50.220
 then you're going to increase the rate of flux

3:03:50.220 --> 3:03:51.620
 through the whole system, and you're

3:03:51.620 --> 3:03:53.540
 going to effectively steepen the driving force

3:03:53.540 --> 3:03:56.660
 to make more nucleotides.

3:03:56.660 --> 3:03:59.940
 And this can be inherited because there

3:03:59.940 --> 3:04:02.780
 are forms of membrane heredity that you can have.

3:04:02.780 --> 3:04:06.500
 And effectively, if a cell divides in two

3:04:06.500 --> 3:04:08.340
 and it's got a lot of stuff inside it,

3:04:08.340 --> 3:04:10.180
 and that stuff is basically bound

3:04:10.180 --> 3:04:14.300
 as a network which is capable of regenerating itself,

3:04:14.300 --> 3:04:17.340
 then it will inevitably regenerate itself.

3:04:17.340 --> 3:04:21.180
 And so you can develop greater complexity.

3:04:21.180 --> 3:04:24.620
 But everything that I've said depends on the underlying rules

3:04:24.620 --> 3:04:25.660
 of thermodynamics.

3:04:25.660 --> 3:04:27.860
 There is no evolvability about that.

3:04:27.860 --> 3:04:33.020
 It's simply an inevitable outcome of your starting point,

3:04:33.020 --> 3:04:35.820
 assuming that you're able to increase the driving

3:04:35.820 --> 3:04:37.220
 force through the system.

3:04:37.220 --> 3:04:38.780
 You will generate more of the same.

3:04:38.780 --> 3:04:40.180
 You'll expand on what you can do,

3:04:40.180 --> 3:04:42.860
 but you'll never get anything different than that.

3:04:42.860 --> 3:04:45.940
 And it's only when you introduce information into that

3:04:45.940 --> 3:04:52.100
 as a gene, as a kind of small stretch of RNA, which

3:04:52.100 --> 3:04:55.340
 can be random stretch, then you get real evolvability.

3:04:55.340 --> 3:04:57.500
 Then you get biology as we know it.

3:04:57.500 --> 3:05:00.500
 But you also have selection as we know it.

3:05:00.500 --> 3:05:06.100
 Yeah, I mean, I don't know how to think about information.

3:05:06.100 --> 3:05:08.100
 That's a kind of memory of the system.

3:05:08.100 --> 3:05:10.620
 So it's not, yeah, at the local level,

3:05:10.620 --> 3:05:13.420
 it's propagation of copying yourself and changing

3:05:13.420 --> 3:05:17.660
 and improving your adaptability to the environment.

3:05:17.660 --> 3:05:23.140
 But if you look at Earth as a whole, it has a kind of memory.

3:05:23.140 --> 3:05:25.140
 That's the key feature of it.

3:05:25.140 --> 3:05:27.620
 In what way?

3:05:27.620 --> 3:05:30.620
 It remembers the stuff it tries.

3:05:30.620 --> 3:05:33.900
 Like, if you were to describe Earth,

3:05:33.900 --> 3:05:39.500
 I think evolution is something that we experience

3:05:39.500 --> 3:05:41.700
 as individual organisms.

3:05:41.700 --> 3:05:44.020
 That's how the individual organisms

3:05:44.020 --> 3:05:45.260
 interact with each other.

3:05:45.260 --> 3:05:47.740
 There's a natural selection.

3:05:47.740 --> 3:05:54.020
 But when you look at Earth as an organism in its entirety,

3:05:54.020 --> 3:05:55.740
 how would you describe it?

3:05:55.740 --> 3:05:56.260
 I mean.

3:05:56.260 --> 3:05:57.980
 Well, not as an organism.

3:05:57.980 --> 3:06:00.860
 I mean, the idea of Gaia is lovely.

3:06:00.860 --> 3:06:04.060
 And James Lovelock originally put Gaia out

3:06:04.060 --> 3:06:07.580
 as an organism that had somehow evolved.

3:06:07.580 --> 3:06:10.300
 And he was immediately attacked by lots of people.

3:06:10.300 --> 3:06:14.220
 And he's not wrong, but he backpedaled somewhat

3:06:14.220 --> 3:06:20.260
 because that was more of a poetic vision than the science.

3:06:20.260 --> 3:06:23.180
 The science is now called Earth systems science.

3:06:23.180 --> 3:06:26.740
 And it's really about how does the world regulate itself

3:06:26.740 --> 3:06:29.300
 so it remains within the limits which are hospitable to life.

3:06:29.300 --> 3:06:30.540
 And it does it amazingly well.

3:06:30.540 --> 3:06:37.020
 And it is working at a planetary level of integration,

3:06:37.020 --> 3:06:38.900
 of regulation.

3:06:38.900 --> 3:06:41.260
 But it's not evolving by natural selection.

3:06:41.260 --> 3:06:43.980
 And it can't because there's only one of it.

3:06:43.980 --> 3:06:45.620
 And so it can change over time.

3:06:45.620 --> 3:06:46.940
 But it's not evolving.

3:06:46.940 --> 3:06:50.620
 All the evolution is happening in the parts of the system.

3:06:50.620 --> 3:06:53.020
 Yeah, but it's a self sustaining organism.

3:06:53.020 --> 3:06:56.140
 No, it's sustained by the sun.

3:06:56.140 --> 3:07:00.940
 Right, so you don't think it's possible to see Earth

3:07:00.940 --> 3:07:03.340
 as its own organism?

3:07:03.340 --> 3:07:04.860
 I think it's poetic and beautiful.

3:07:04.860 --> 3:07:08.540
 And I often refer to the Earth as a living planet.

3:07:08.540 --> 3:07:14.860
 But it's not, in biological terms, an organism, no.

3:07:14.860 --> 3:07:20.580
 If aliens were to visit Earth, what would they notice?

3:07:20.580 --> 3:07:24.060
 What would be the basic unit of light they would notice?

3:07:24.060 --> 3:07:25.020
 Trees, probably.

3:07:25.020 --> 3:07:26.300
 I mean, it's green.

3:07:26.300 --> 3:07:27.300
 It's green and blue.

3:07:27.300 --> 3:07:29.140
 I think that's the first thing you'd notice.

3:07:29.140 --> 3:07:32.060
 It stands out from space as being different to any

3:07:32.060 --> 3:07:33.020
 of the other planets.

3:07:33.020 --> 3:07:36.260
 So it would notice the trees at first because the green.

3:07:36.260 --> 3:07:36.940
 Well, I would.

3:07:36.940 --> 3:07:39.020
 I notice the green, yes.

3:07:39.020 --> 3:07:42.820
 And then probably notice, figure out the photosynthesis.

3:07:42.820 --> 3:07:47.460
 Probably notice cities a second, I suspect, maybe first.

3:07:47.460 --> 3:07:49.300
 If they arrived at night, they'd notice cities first,

3:07:49.300 --> 3:07:50.140
 that's for sure.

3:07:50.140 --> 3:07:50.940
 It depends.

3:07:50.940 --> 3:07:52.100
 Depends the time.

3:07:52.100 --> 3:07:55.460
 You write quite beautifully in Transformers.

3:07:55.460 --> 3:07:57.700
 Once again, I think you opened the book in this way.

3:07:57.700 --> 3:07:59.060
 I don't remember.

3:07:59.060 --> 3:08:04.020
 From space, describing Earth, it's such an interesting idea

3:08:04.020 --> 3:08:10.540
 of what Earth is, you also, I mean, Hitchhiker's Guide,

3:08:10.540 --> 3:08:13.300
 summarizing it as harmless, or mostly harmless.

3:08:13.300 --> 3:08:15.580
 It's a beautifully poetic thing.

3:08:15.580 --> 3:08:19.060
 You open Transformers with, from space,

3:08:19.060 --> 3:08:22.260
 it looks gray and crystalline, obliterating

3:08:22.260 --> 3:08:24.860
 the blue green colors of the living Earth.

3:08:24.860 --> 3:08:27.220
 It is crisscrossed by irregular patterns

3:08:27.220 --> 3:08:30.740
 and convergent striations.

3:08:30.740 --> 3:08:33.220
 There's a central amorphous density

3:08:33.220 --> 3:08:35.460
 where these scratches seem lighter.

3:08:35.460 --> 3:08:38.340
 This, quote, growth does not look alive,

3:08:38.340 --> 3:08:41.260
 although it has extended out along some lines,

3:08:41.260 --> 3:08:44.980
 and there is something grasping and parasitic about it.

3:08:44.980 --> 3:08:47.460
 Across the globe, there are thousands of them,

3:08:47.460 --> 3:08:51.780
 varying in shape and detail, but all of them gray, angular,

3:08:51.780 --> 3:08:54.660
 and organic, spreading.

3:08:54.660 --> 3:08:59.340
 Yet at night, they light up, glowing up the dark sky,

3:08:59.340 --> 3:09:00.820
 suddenly beautiful.

3:09:00.820 --> 3:09:03.340
 Perhaps these cankers on the landscape

3:09:03.340 --> 3:09:05.060
 are in some sense living.

3:09:05.060 --> 3:09:07.260
 There's a controlled flow of energy.

3:09:07.260 --> 3:09:10.460
 There must be information and some form of metabolism,

3:09:10.460 --> 3:09:12.700
 some turnover of materials.

3:09:12.700 --> 3:09:14.060
 Are they alive?

3:09:14.060 --> 3:09:16.020
 No, of course not.

3:09:16.020 --> 3:09:17.300
 They are cities.

3:09:18.220 --> 3:09:22.100
 So is there some sense that cities are living beings?

3:09:22.100 --> 3:09:24.980
 You think aliens would think of them as living beings?

3:09:24.980 --> 3:09:27.580
 Well, it'd be easy to see it that way, wouldn't it?

3:09:27.580 --> 3:09:30.580
 It wakes up at night, they wake up at night.

3:09:30.580 --> 3:09:33.940
 Strictly nocturnal, yes.

3:09:33.940 --> 3:09:36.180
 I imagine that any aliens that are smart enough

3:09:36.180 --> 3:09:37.620
 to get here would understand

3:09:37.620 --> 3:09:40.700
 that they're not living beings.

3:09:40.700 --> 3:09:45.700
 My reason for saying that is that we tend to think

3:09:47.460 --> 3:09:52.460
 of biology in terms of information and forget about cells.

3:09:52.460 --> 3:09:54.820
 I was trying to draw a comparison between the cell

3:09:54.820 --> 3:09:57.940
 as a city and the energy flow through the city

3:09:57.940 --> 3:09:59.700
 and the energy flow through cells

3:09:59.700 --> 3:10:01.580
 and the turnover of materials.

3:10:01.580 --> 3:10:04.060
 And an interesting thing about cities

3:10:04.060 --> 3:10:08.260
 is that they're not really exactly governed by anybody.

3:10:09.860 --> 3:10:12.980
 There are regulations and systems and whatever else,

3:10:12.980 --> 3:10:14.700
 but it's pretty loose.

3:10:16.700 --> 3:10:18.420
 They have their own life,

3:10:18.420 --> 3:10:20.420
 their own way of developing over time.

3:10:20.420 --> 3:10:23.020
 And in that sense, they're quite biological.

3:10:23.020 --> 3:10:27.020
 There was a plan after the great fire of London.

3:10:27.020 --> 3:10:29.580
 Christopher Wren was making plans

3:10:29.580 --> 3:10:31.780
 not only for St. Paul's Cathedral,

3:10:31.780 --> 3:10:35.780
 but also to rebuild in large Parisian type boulevards,

3:10:35.780 --> 3:10:40.780
 a large part of the area of central London that was burned.

3:10:40.780 --> 3:10:42.500
 And it never happened

3:10:42.500 --> 3:10:44.460
 because they didn't have enough money, I think.

3:10:44.460 --> 3:10:45.940
 But it's interesting what was in the plan.

3:10:45.940 --> 3:10:47.020
 There were all these boulevards

3:10:47.020 --> 3:10:48.980
 that were built in the middle of the city.

3:10:48.980 --> 3:10:50.540
 It's interesting what was in the plan.

3:10:50.540 --> 3:10:51.900
 There were all these boulevards,

3:10:51.900 --> 3:10:55.460
 but there were no pubs and no coffee houses

3:10:55.460 --> 3:10:56.900
 or anything like that.

3:10:56.900 --> 3:11:00.420
 And the reality was London just kind of grew up

3:11:00.420 --> 3:11:03.220
 in a set of jumbled streets.

3:11:03.220 --> 3:11:04.660
 And it was the coffee houses and the pubs

3:11:04.660 --> 3:11:07.060
 where all the business of the city of London was being done.

3:11:07.060 --> 3:11:09.180
 And that was where the real life of the city was.

3:11:09.180 --> 3:11:10.060
 And no one had planned it.

3:11:10.060 --> 3:11:13.780
 The whole thing was unplanned and works much better that way.

3:11:13.780 --> 3:11:15.900
 And in that sense, the cell is completely unplanned,

3:11:15.900 --> 3:11:17.980
 is not controlled by the genes in the nucleus

3:11:17.980 --> 3:11:19.660
 in the way that we might like to think that it is,

3:11:19.660 --> 3:11:22.300
 but it's kind of evolved entity

3:11:22.300 --> 3:11:24.180
 that has the same kind of flux,

3:11:24.180 --> 3:11:25.820
 the same animation, the same life.

3:11:25.820 --> 3:11:28.540
 So I think it's a beautiful analogy,

3:11:28.540 --> 3:11:32.420
 but I wouldn't get too stuck with it as a metaphor.

3:11:32.420 --> 3:11:33.500
 See, I disagree with you.

3:11:33.500 --> 3:11:34.980
 I disagree with you.

3:11:34.980 --> 3:11:39.140
 I think you are so steeped,

3:11:39.140 --> 3:11:42.580
 and actually the entirety of science,

3:11:43.500 --> 3:11:45.540
 the history of science is steeped

3:11:45.540 --> 3:11:50.140
 in a biological framework of thinking about what is life.

3:11:50.140 --> 3:11:54.140
 And not just biological, it's very human centric too.

3:11:54.140 --> 3:11:58.340
 That human, the human organism is the epitome of life

3:11:59.940 --> 3:12:00.860
 on earth.

3:12:00.860 --> 3:12:01.740
 I don't know.

3:12:01.740 --> 3:12:04.060
 I think there is some deep fundamental way

3:12:04.060 --> 3:12:07.180
 in which a city is a living being

3:12:07.180 --> 3:12:09.100
 in the same way that a human individual can.

3:12:09.100 --> 3:12:13.100
 But it doesn't give rise to an offspring city.

3:12:13.100 --> 3:12:15.860
 So it doesn't work by natural selection.

3:12:15.860 --> 3:12:17.860
 It works by, if anything, memes.

3:12:17.860 --> 3:12:21.980
 It works by copying itself conceptually

3:12:21.980 --> 3:12:24.580
 as a mode of being.

3:12:24.580 --> 3:12:29.580
 So maybe memes, maybe ideas are the organisms

3:12:29.700 --> 3:12:32.300
 that are really essential to life on earth.

3:12:32.300 --> 3:12:34.140
 Maybe it's much more important

3:12:34.140 --> 3:12:37.020
 about the collective aspect of human nature,

3:12:37.020 --> 3:12:38.060
 the collective intelligence

3:12:38.060 --> 3:12:40.060
 than the individual intelligence.

3:12:40.060 --> 3:12:43.780
 Maybe the collective humanity is the organism.

3:12:43.780 --> 3:12:48.140
 And the thing that defines the collective intelligence

3:12:48.140 --> 3:12:50.740
 of humanity is the ideas.

3:12:50.740 --> 3:12:54.300
 And maybe the way that manifests itself is cities,

3:12:54.300 --> 3:12:57.900
 maybe, or societies or geographically concentrated societies

3:12:57.900 --> 3:12:59.900
 or nations and all that kind of stuff.

3:12:59.900 --> 3:13:02.100
 I mean, from an alien perspective,

3:13:02.100 --> 3:13:06.460
 it's possible that that is the more deeply noticeable thing,

3:13:06.460 --> 3:13:08.780
 not from a place of ignorance.

3:13:08.780 --> 3:13:11.180
 What's noticeable doesn't tell you how it works.

3:13:12.340 --> 3:13:14.140
 I think, I mean, I don't have any problem

3:13:14.140 --> 3:13:15.140
 with what you're saying really,

3:13:15.140 --> 3:13:20.140
 except that it's not possible without the humans.

3:13:20.700 --> 3:13:25.300
 You know, we went from a hunter gatherers type economy,

3:13:25.300 --> 3:13:28.260
 if you like, without cities to cities.

3:13:28.260 --> 3:13:30.300
 And as soon as we get into human evolution

3:13:30.300 --> 3:13:32.420
 and culture and society and so on,

3:13:32.420 --> 3:13:36.460
 then yes, there are other forms of evolution,

3:13:36.460 --> 3:13:38.660
 other forms of change.

3:13:38.660 --> 3:13:41.700
 But cities don't directly propagate themselves,

3:13:41.700 --> 3:13:43.940
 they propagate themselves through human societies

3:13:43.940 --> 3:13:46.020
 and human societies only exist because humans

3:13:46.020 --> 3:13:48.340
 as individuals propagate themselves.

3:13:48.340 --> 3:13:51.420
 So there's a kind of, there is a hierarchy there

3:13:51.420 --> 3:13:52.860
 and without the humans in the first place,

3:13:52.860 --> 3:13:54.420
 none of the rest of it exists.

3:13:54.420 --> 3:13:59.260
 So do you, life is primarily defined by the basic unit

3:13:59.260 --> 3:14:01.660
 on which evolution can operate?

3:14:01.660 --> 3:14:04.220
 I think it's a really important thing, yes.

3:14:04.220 --> 3:14:05.060
 Yeah.

3:14:05.060 --> 3:14:08.660
 And we don't know, we don't have any other better ideas

3:14:08.660 --> 3:14:10.660
 than evolution for how to create life.

3:14:10.660 --> 3:14:13.100
 I never came across a better idea than evolution.

3:14:13.100 --> 3:14:15.740
 I mean, maybe I'm just ignorant and I don't know.

3:14:15.740 --> 3:14:19.180
 And there's, you know, you mentioned that's no automator

3:14:19.180 --> 3:14:22.540
 and so on, and I don't think specifically about that,

3:14:22.540 --> 3:14:24.900
 but I have thought about it in terms of selective units

3:14:24.900 --> 3:14:26.980
 of the origin of life and the difference

3:14:26.980 --> 3:14:29.500
 between evolvability and complexity

3:14:29.500 --> 3:14:31.420
 or just increasing complexity,

3:14:31.420 --> 3:14:35.580
 but within very narrow, narrowly defined limits.

3:14:35.580 --> 3:14:39.460
 The great thing about genes and about selection

3:14:39.460 --> 3:14:41.420
 is it just knocks down all those limits.

3:14:41.420 --> 3:14:43.540
 It gives you a world of information in the end

3:14:43.540 --> 3:14:47.780
 which is limited only by the biophysical reality

3:14:47.780 --> 3:14:49.940
 of what kind of an organism you are,

3:14:49.940 --> 3:14:52.300
 what kind of a planet you live on and so on.

3:14:52.300 --> 3:14:55.740
 And cities and all these other forms that look alive

3:14:55.740 --> 3:14:58.060
 and could be described as alive

3:14:58.060 --> 3:14:59.860
 because they can't propagate themselves

3:14:59.860 --> 3:15:02.700
 can only exist as the product of something

3:15:02.700 --> 3:15:04.180
 that did propagate itself.

3:15:05.060 --> 3:15:05.900
 Yeah.

3:15:07.180 --> 3:15:09.300
 I mean, there's a deeply compelling truth

3:15:09.300 --> 3:15:11.700
 to that kind of way of looking at things,

3:15:11.700 --> 3:15:16.100
 but I just hope that we don't miss the giant cloud

3:15:17.820 --> 3:15:18.780
 among us.

3:15:18.780 --> 3:15:21.380
 I kind of hope that I'm wrong about a lot of this

3:15:21.380 --> 3:15:24.100
 because I can't say that my worldview

3:15:24.100 --> 3:15:28.140
 is particularly uplifting, but in some sense,

3:15:28.140 --> 3:15:29.900
 it doesn't matter if it's uplifting or not.

3:15:29.900 --> 3:15:33.380
 Science is about what's reality, what's out there,

3:15:33.380 --> 3:15:35.220
 why is it this way?

3:15:35.220 --> 3:15:38.180
 And I think there's beauty in that too.

3:15:39.100 --> 3:15:41.260
 There's beauty in darkness.

3:15:41.260 --> 3:15:43.820
 You write about life and death

3:15:43.820 --> 3:15:45.580
 sort of at the biological level.

3:15:46.660 --> 3:15:49.780
 Does the question of suicide, why live,

3:15:49.780 --> 3:15:52.220
 does the question of why the human mind

3:15:52.220 --> 3:15:56.180
 is capable of depression, are you able to introspect

3:15:56.180 --> 3:16:00.340
 that from a place of biology?

3:16:00.340 --> 3:16:05.340
 Why our minds, why we humans can go to such dark places?

3:16:05.700 --> 3:16:08.020
 Why can we commit suicide?

3:16:08.020 --> 3:16:13.020
 Why can we go suffer, suffer period,

3:16:15.660 --> 3:16:19.340
 but also suffer from a feeling of meaninglessness

3:16:19.340 --> 3:16:23.100
 of going to a dark place that depression can take you?

3:16:23.100 --> 3:16:26.180
 Is this a feature of life or is it a bug?

3:16:30.420 --> 3:16:31.260
 I don't know.

3:16:31.260 --> 3:16:32.460
 I mean, if it's a feature of life,

3:16:32.460 --> 3:16:33.940
 then I suppose it would have to be true

3:16:33.940 --> 3:16:35.540
 of other organisms as well.

3:16:35.540 --> 3:16:39.220
 And I don't know, we were talking about dogs earlier on

3:16:39.220 --> 3:16:43.540
 and they can certainly be very sad and upset

3:16:43.540 --> 3:16:46.420
 and may mooch for days after their owner died

3:16:46.420 --> 3:16:47.620
 or something like that.

3:16:47.620 --> 3:16:50.260
 So I suspect in some sense it's a feature of biology.

3:16:50.260 --> 3:16:54.380
 It's probably a feature of mortality.

3:16:54.380 --> 3:16:59.380
 It's probably a, but beyond all of that,

3:16:59.900 --> 3:17:01.740
 I mean, I guess there's two ways you could come at it.

3:17:01.740 --> 3:17:03.340
 There's one of them would be to say,

3:17:03.340 --> 3:17:07.540
 well, you can effectively do the math

3:17:07.540 --> 3:17:10.260
 and come to the conclusion that it's all pointless

3:17:10.260 --> 3:17:11.700
 and that there's really no point

3:17:11.700 --> 3:17:13.100
 in me being here any longer.

3:17:14.580 --> 3:17:17.700
 And maybe that's true in the greater scheme of things.

3:17:17.700 --> 3:17:20.140
 You can justify yourself in terms of society,

3:17:20.140 --> 3:17:22.100
 but society will be gone soon enough as well.

3:17:22.100 --> 3:17:25.220
 And you end up with a very bleak place just by logic.

3:17:26.060 --> 3:17:27.540
 In some sense, it's surprising

3:17:27.540 --> 3:17:29.380
 that we can find any meaning at all.

3:17:30.300 --> 3:17:32.140
 Well, maybe this is where consciousness comes in

3:17:32.140 --> 3:17:35.140
 that we have transient joy, but with transient joy,

3:17:35.140 --> 3:17:37.020
 we have transient misery as well.

3:17:37.020 --> 3:17:40.220
 And sometimes with everything in biology,

3:17:41.740 --> 3:17:45.260
 getting the regulation right is practically impossible.

3:17:45.260 --> 3:17:47.300
 You will always have a bell shaped curve

3:17:47.300 --> 3:17:50.340
 where some people unfortunately are at the joy end

3:17:50.340 --> 3:17:52.100
 and some people are at the misery end.

3:17:52.100 --> 3:17:55.060
 And that's the way brains are wired.

3:17:55.060 --> 3:17:58.700
 And I doubt there's ever an escape from that.

3:17:58.700 --> 3:18:00.740
 It's the same with sex and everything else as well.

3:18:00.740 --> 3:18:04.220
 We're dealing with, you can't regulate it.

3:18:04.220 --> 3:18:08.580
 So anything goes, it's all part of biology.

3:18:12.220 --> 3:18:13.860
 Amen to that.

3:18:13.860 --> 3:18:18.860
 Let me, on writing in your book, Power, Sex and Suicide.

3:18:21.140 --> 3:18:24.060
 First of all, can I just read off the books you've written?

3:18:24.060 --> 3:18:27.740
 If there's any better titles and topics to be covered,

3:18:27.740 --> 3:18:28.900
 I don't know what they are.

3:18:28.900 --> 3:18:29.740
 It makes me look forward

3:18:29.740 --> 3:18:31.500
 to whatever you're going to write next.

3:18:31.500 --> 3:18:34.140
 I hope there's things you write next.

3:18:34.140 --> 3:18:37.140
 So first you wrote oxygen, the molecule that made the world

3:18:37.140 --> 3:18:39.220
 as we've talked about this idea

3:18:39.220 --> 3:18:41.620
 of the role of oxygen in life on earth.

3:18:41.620 --> 3:18:46.380
 Then wait for it, power, sex, suicide, mitochondria

3:18:46.380 --> 3:18:48.220
 and the meaning of life.

3:18:48.220 --> 3:18:52.420
 Then life ascending, the 10 great inventions of evolution.

3:18:52.420 --> 3:18:54.860
 The vital question, the first book I've read of yours,

3:18:54.860 --> 3:18:58.040
 the vital question, why is life the way it is?

3:18:58.040 --> 3:19:00.240
 And the new book, Transformer,

3:19:00.240 --> 3:19:02.440
 the deep chemistry of life and death.

3:19:03.480 --> 3:19:08.480
 In Power, Sex and Suicide, you write about writing

3:19:08.680 --> 3:19:09.920
 or about a lot of things,

3:19:09.920 --> 3:19:11.980
 but I have a question about writing.

3:19:13.480 --> 3:19:16.640
 You write, in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

3:19:16.640 --> 3:19:20.720
 Ford Perfect spends 15 years researching his revision

3:19:20.720 --> 3:19:23.180
 to the guide's entry on the earth,

3:19:23.180 --> 3:19:25.880
 which originally read harmless.

3:19:26.700 --> 3:19:29.080
 By the way, I would also as a side quest,

3:19:29.080 --> 3:19:30.760
 as a side question would like to ask you

3:19:30.760 --> 3:19:33.560
 what would be your summary of what earth is.

3:19:34.720 --> 3:19:37.900
 You write, his long essay on the subject is edited down

3:19:37.900 --> 3:19:41.560
 by the guide to read mostly harmless.

3:19:41.560 --> 3:19:46.060
 I suspect that too many new editions suffer similar fate,

3:19:46.060 --> 3:19:48.440
 if not through absurd editing decisions,

3:19:48.440 --> 3:19:51.600
 at least through a lack of meaningful change in content.

3:19:51.600 --> 3:19:54.360
 As it happens, nearly 15 years have passed

3:19:54.360 --> 3:19:57.920
 since the first edition of Power, Sex, Suicide was published

3:19:57.920 --> 3:20:02.400
 and I am resisting the temptation to make any lame revisions.

3:20:02.400 --> 3:20:05.600
 Some say that even Darwin lessened the power

3:20:05.600 --> 3:20:08.520
 of his arguments in The Origin of Species

3:20:08.520 --> 3:20:10.320
 through his multiple revisions,

3:20:10.320 --> 3:20:12.520
 in which he dealt with criticisms

3:20:12.520 --> 3:20:16.040
 and sometimes shifted his views in the wrong direction.

3:20:16.040 --> 3:20:19.320
 I prefer my original to speak for itself,

3:20:19.320 --> 3:20:21.580
 even if it turns out to be wrong.

3:20:23.160 --> 3:20:25.800
 Let me ask the question about writing,

3:20:25.800 --> 3:20:28.160
 both your students in the academic setting,

3:20:28.160 --> 3:20:30.920
 but also writing some of the most brilliant writings

3:20:30.920 --> 3:20:33.400
 on science and humanity I've ever read.

3:20:33.400 --> 3:20:36.280
 What's the process of writing?

3:20:36.280 --> 3:20:41.280
 How do you advise other humans?

3:20:43.140 --> 3:20:46.800
 If you were to talk to young Darwin or the young you

3:20:47.760 --> 3:20:51.400
 and just young anybody and give advice about how to write

3:20:51.400 --> 3:20:54.400
 and how to write well about these big topics,

3:20:54.400 --> 3:20:55.300
 what would you say?

3:20:56.720 --> 3:20:59.300
 I mean, I suppose there's a couple of points.

3:20:59.300 --> 3:21:03.560
 One of them is what's the story?

3:21:03.560 --> 3:21:04.760
 What do I want to know?

3:21:04.760 --> 3:21:06.560
 What do I want to convey?

3:21:06.560 --> 3:21:08.760
 Why does it matter to anybody?

3:21:08.760 --> 3:21:13.480
 And very often the biggest, most interesting questions,

3:21:15.160 --> 3:21:19.640
 the childlike questions are the one actually

3:21:19.640 --> 3:21:22.000
 that everybody wants to ask, but dents quite,

3:21:22.000 --> 3:21:23.600
 do it in case they look stupid.

3:21:24.640 --> 3:21:26.960
 And one of the nice things about being in science

3:21:26.960 --> 3:21:28.480
 is the longer you're in,

3:21:28.480 --> 3:21:30.240
 the more you realize that everybody doesn't know

3:21:30.240 --> 3:21:31.320
 the answer to these questions

3:21:31.320 --> 3:21:33.520
 and it's not so stupid to ask them after all.

3:21:36.200 --> 3:21:39.680
 So trying to ask the questions

3:21:39.680 --> 3:21:44.520
 that I would have been asking myself at the age of 15, 16,

3:21:44.520 --> 3:21:47.240
 when I was really hungry to know about the world

3:21:47.240 --> 3:21:48.760
 and didn't know very much about it

3:21:48.760 --> 3:21:53.760
 and wanted to go to the edge of what we know,

3:21:53.760 --> 3:21:58.240
 but be helped to get there.

3:21:58.240 --> 3:22:01.440
 I don't want to be too much terminology.

3:22:01.440 --> 3:22:03.940
 And so I want someone to keep a clean eye

3:22:03.940 --> 3:22:05.080
 on what the question is.

3:22:07.000 --> 3:22:12.000
 Beyond that, I've wondered a lot about who am I writing for?

3:22:13.200 --> 3:22:16.300
 And that was in the end, the only answer I had

3:22:16.300 --> 3:22:19.160
 was myself at the age of 15 or 16,

3:22:19.160 --> 3:22:24.160
 because even if you just don't know who's reading,

3:22:25.200 --> 3:22:27.280
 but also where are they reading it?

3:22:27.280 --> 3:22:29.680
 Are they reading it in the bath or in bed

3:22:29.680 --> 3:22:34.240
 or on the Metro or listening to an audio book?

3:22:34.240 --> 3:22:39.160
 Do you want to have a recapitulation every few pages

3:22:39.160 --> 3:22:41.080
 because you read three pages at a time

3:22:41.080 --> 3:22:44.120
 or are you really irritated by that?

3:22:44.120 --> 3:22:46.880
 You're going to get criticism from people

3:22:46.880 --> 3:22:48.800
 who are irritated by what you're doing.

3:22:48.800 --> 3:22:50.600
 And you don't know who they are or what you're going to do

3:22:50.600 --> 3:22:51.760
 that's going to irritate people.

3:22:51.760 --> 3:22:53.800
 And in the end, all you can do is just try

3:22:53.800 --> 3:22:56.400
 and please yourself.

3:22:57.800 --> 3:23:00.520
 And that means, well, what are these big fun,

3:23:00.520 --> 3:23:03.040
 fascinating and big questions?

3:23:03.040 --> 3:23:04.960
 And what do we know about it?

3:23:04.960 --> 3:23:07.160
 And can I convey that?

3:23:07.160 --> 3:23:09.200
 And I kind of learned in trying to write,

3:23:10.520 --> 3:23:14.360
 first of all, say what we know.

3:23:14.360 --> 3:23:16.600
 And I was shocked in the first couple of books

3:23:16.600 --> 3:23:19.600
 how often I came up quickly against

3:23:19.600 --> 3:23:21.600
 all the stuff we don't know.

3:23:21.600 --> 3:23:25.040
 And if you're trying to, I've realized later on

3:23:25.040 --> 3:23:29.720
 in supervising various physicists and mathematicians

3:23:29.720 --> 3:23:32.960
 who are PhD students, their maths is way beyond

3:23:32.960 --> 3:23:34.480
 what I can do.

3:23:34.480 --> 3:23:36.680
 But the process of trying to work out

3:23:36.680 --> 3:23:37.960
 what are we actually going to model here?

3:23:37.960 --> 3:23:39.240
 What's going into this equation?

3:23:39.240 --> 3:23:40.480
 It's a very similar one to writing.

3:23:40.480 --> 3:23:42.120
 What am I going to put on a page?

3:23:42.120 --> 3:23:43.680
 What's the simplest possible way

3:23:43.680 --> 3:23:45.640
 I can encapsulate this idea?

3:23:45.640 --> 3:23:47.160
 So that I now have it as a unit

3:23:47.160 --> 3:23:48.920
 that I can kind of see how it interacts

3:23:48.920 --> 3:23:50.560
 with the other units.

3:23:50.560 --> 3:23:53.040
 And you realize that, well, if this is like that

3:23:53.040 --> 3:23:55.560
 and this is like this, then that can't be true.

3:23:58.080 --> 3:24:00.560
 So you end up navigating your own path

3:24:00.560 --> 3:24:02.040
 through this landscape.

3:24:02.040 --> 3:24:02.960
 And that can be thrilling

3:24:02.960 --> 3:24:05.160
 because you don't know where it's going.

3:24:05.160 --> 3:24:07.480
 And I'd like to think that that's one of the reasons

3:24:07.480 --> 3:24:09.120
 my books have worked for people

3:24:09.120 --> 3:24:12.000
 because this sense of the thrilling adventure ride

3:24:12.000 --> 3:24:14.200
 that I don't know where it's going either.

3:24:14.200 --> 3:24:16.600
 So finding the simplest possible way

3:24:16.600 --> 3:24:18.440
 to explain the things we know

3:24:18.440 --> 3:24:20.080
 and the simplest possible way to explain

3:24:20.080 --> 3:24:20.960
 the things we don't know

3:24:20.960 --> 3:24:22.680
 and the tension between those two.

3:24:22.680 --> 3:24:25.120
 And that's where the story emerges.

3:24:25.120 --> 3:24:26.400
 What about the edit?

3:24:27.240 --> 3:24:31.240
 Do you find yourself to the point of this,

3:24:32.960 --> 3:24:35.320
 you know, editing down to mostly harmless?

3:24:36.400 --> 3:24:40.720
 To arrive at simplicity, do you find the edit is productive

3:24:40.720 --> 3:24:44.120
 or does it destroy the magic that was originally there?

3:24:44.120 --> 3:24:47.920
 No, I usually find, I think I'm perhaps a better editor

3:24:47.920 --> 3:24:48.880
 than I am a writer.

3:24:48.880 --> 3:24:51.240
 I write and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite.

3:24:51.240 --> 3:24:52.920
 Put a bunch of crap on the page first

3:24:52.920 --> 3:24:55.280
 and then see the edit where it takes you.

3:24:55.280 --> 3:24:58.200
 Yeah, but then there's the professional editors

3:24:58.200 --> 3:24:59.200
 who come along as well.

3:24:59.200 --> 3:25:04.200
 And I mean, in Transformer, the editor came back to me

3:25:05.080 --> 3:25:07.120
 after I'd sent him, two months after I sent

3:25:07.120 --> 3:25:08.600
 the first edition, he'd read the whole thing

3:25:08.600 --> 3:25:11.560
 and he said, the first two chapters prevent

3:25:11.560 --> 3:25:14.200
 a formidable hurdle to the general reader.

3:25:14.200 --> 3:25:16.360
 Go and do something about it.

3:25:16.360 --> 3:25:18.640
 And that was the last thing I really wanted to do.

3:25:18.640 --> 3:25:21.440
 Your editor sounds very eloquent in speech.

3:25:21.440 --> 3:25:23.000
 Yeah, well, this was an email,

3:25:23.000 --> 3:25:26.600
 but I thought about it, you know,

3:25:26.600 --> 3:25:28.800
 the bottom line is he was right.

3:25:28.800 --> 3:25:33.240
 And so I put the whole thing aside for about two months,

3:25:33.240 --> 3:25:35.080
 spent the summer, this would have been,

3:25:35.080 --> 3:25:38.160
 I guess last summer, and then turned to it

3:25:38.160 --> 3:25:40.880
 with full attention in about September or something

3:25:40.880 --> 3:25:42.920
 and rewrote those chapters almost from scratch.

3:25:42.920 --> 3:25:44.040
 I kept some of the material,

3:25:44.040 --> 3:25:47.240
 but it took me a long time to process it,

3:25:47.240 --> 3:25:49.800
 to work out what needs to change, where does it need to,

3:25:49.800 --> 3:25:51.200
 I wasn't writing in this time.

3:25:51.200 --> 3:25:53.360
 How am I going to tell this story better

3:25:53.360 --> 3:25:54.840
 so it's more accessible and interesting?

3:25:54.840 --> 3:25:56.880
 And in the end, I think it worked.

3:25:56.880 --> 3:25:58.440
 It's still difficult.

3:25:58.440 --> 3:26:00.760
 It's still biochemistry, but it has,

3:26:00.760 --> 3:26:03.360
 he ended up saying, now he's got a barreling energy to it.

3:26:03.360 --> 3:26:05.720
 And I was, you know, because he'd been,

3:26:05.720 --> 3:26:07.120
 because he'd told me the truth the first time,

3:26:07.120 --> 3:26:08.920
 I decided to believe that he was telling me the truth

3:26:08.920 --> 3:26:11.740
 the second time as well and was delighted.

3:26:13.480 --> 3:26:17.320
 Could you give advice to young people in general,

3:26:18.680 --> 3:26:20.400
 folks in high school, folks in college,

3:26:20.400 --> 3:26:23.080
 how to take on some of the big questions you've taken on?

3:26:23.080 --> 3:26:24.760
 Now you've done that in the space of biology

3:26:24.760 --> 3:26:26.680
 and expanded out.

3:26:26.680 --> 3:26:31.680
 How can they have a career they can be proud of

3:26:32.480 --> 3:26:35.160
 or have a life they can be proud of?

3:26:35.160 --> 3:26:37.560
 Gosh, that's a big question.

3:26:40.520 --> 3:26:42.680
 I'm sure you've gathered some wisdom

3:26:42.680 --> 3:26:44.440
 that you can impart.

3:26:44.440 --> 3:26:48.920
 Yeah, so the only advice that I actually ever give

3:26:48.920 --> 3:26:53.840
 to my students is follow what you're interested in

3:26:55.360 --> 3:26:58.080
 because they're often worried

3:26:58.080 --> 3:26:59.840
 that if they make this decision now

3:26:59.840 --> 3:27:01.920
 and do this course instead of that course,

3:27:01.920 --> 3:27:04.080
 then they're going to restrict their career opportunities

3:27:04.080 --> 3:27:08.720
 and there isn't a career path in science.

3:27:08.720 --> 3:27:11.320
 It's not, I mean, there is, but there isn't.

3:27:12.840 --> 3:27:14.080
 There's a lot of competition,

3:27:14.080 --> 3:27:16.320
 there's a lot of death symbolically.

3:27:17.480 --> 3:27:19.200
 So who survives?

3:27:19.200 --> 3:27:20.960
 The people who survive are the people

3:27:20.960 --> 3:27:25.320
 who care enough to still do it.

3:27:25.320 --> 3:27:26.840
 And they're very often the people

3:27:26.840 --> 3:27:31.280
 who don't worry too much about the future

3:27:31.280 --> 3:27:33.520
 and are able to live in the present.

3:27:33.520 --> 3:27:35.240
 Because if you do a PhD,

3:27:35.240 --> 3:27:37.440
 you've competed hard to get onto the PhD,

3:27:37.440 --> 3:27:39.520
 then you have to compete hard to get a postdoc job

3:27:39.520 --> 3:27:44.080
 and you have the next one maybe on another continent

3:27:44.080 --> 3:27:46.200
 and it's only two years anyway.

3:27:46.200 --> 3:27:49.320
 And so, and there's no guarantee

3:27:49.320 --> 3:27:52.320
 you're going to get a faculty position at the end of it.

3:27:52.320 --> 3:27:53.160
 So.

3:27:53.160 --> 3:27:54.960
 And there's always the next step to compete.

3:27:54.960 --> 3:27:56.840
 If you get a faculty position,

3:27:56.840 --> 3:27:59.840
 you get a tenure and with tenure go full professor

3:27:59.840 --> 3:28:01.960
 and full professor, then you go to some kind of,

3:28:01.960 --> 3:28:03.160
 whatever the discipline is,

3:28:03.160 --> 3:28:04.320
 there's an award.

3:28:04.320 --> 3:28:05.240
 If you're in physics,

3:28:05.240 --> 3:28:06.840
 you're always competing for the Nobel Prize.

3:28:06.840 --> 3:28:08.400
 There's different awards.

3:28:08.400 --> 3:28:11.160
 And then eventually you're all competing to,

3:28:11.160 --> 3:28:12.600
 I mean, there's always a competition.

3:28:12.600 --> 3:28:13.960
 So there is no happiness.

3:28:13.960 --> 3:28:14.920
 Happiness does not lie.

3:28:14.920 --> 3:28:16.840
 If you're looking into the future, yes.

3:28:16.840 --> 3:28:18.760
 And if what you're caring about is a career,

3:28:18.760 --> 3:28:22.480
 then it's probably not the one for you.

3:28:22.480 --> 3:28:25.560
 If though you can put that aside,

3:28:25.560 --> 3:28:28.760
 and I've also worked in industry for a brief period

3:28:28.760 --> 3:28:30.880
 and I was made redundant twice.

3:28:30.880 --> 3:28:32.360
 So I know that.

3:28:32.360 --> 3:28:35.960
 You know, there's no guarantee

3:28:35.960 --> 3:28:37.920
 that you've got a career that way either.

3:28:37.920 --> 3:28:38.760
 Yes.

3:28:38.760 --> 3:28:42.640
 So, so live in the moment

3:28:42.640 --> 3:28:44.200
 and try and enjoy what you're doing.

3:28:44.200 --> 3:28:46.600
 And that means really go to the,

3:28:48.520 --> 3:28:50.880
 go to the themes that you're most interested in

3:28:50.880 --> 3:28:52.840
 and try and follow them as well as you can.

3:28:52.840 --> 3:28:57.360
 And that tends to pay back in surprising ways.

3:28:57.360 --> 3:28:58.640
 I don't know if you've found this as well,

3:28:58.640 --> 3:29:03.640
 but I found that people will help you often.

3:29:04.040 --> 3:29:08.400
 If they see some light shining in the eye,

3:29:08.400 --> 3:29:10.520
 you're excited about their subject

3:29:11.920 --> 3:29:15.800
 and you know, just want to talk about it.

3:29:15.800 --> 3:29:18.600
 And they know that their friend in California

3:29:18.600 --> 3:29:19.520
 has got a job coming up.

3:29:19.520 --> 3:29:21.440
 They'll say, go for this, this guy's all right.

3:29:21.440 --> 3:29:26.040
 You know, they'll use the network to help you out

3:29:26.040 --> 3:29:27.040
 if you really care.

3:29:27.040 --> 3:29:29.600
 And you're not gonna have a job two years down the line,

3:29:29.600 --> 3:29:32.920
 but if what you really care about is what you're doing now,

3:29:32.920 --> 3:29:34.120
 then it doesn't matter if you have a job

3:29:34.120 --> 3:29:35.480
 in two years time or not.

3:29:35.480 --> 3:29:38.840
 It'll work itself out if you've got the light in your eye.

3:29:39.960 --> 3:29:42.360
 And so that's the only advice I can give.

3:29:42.360 --> 3:29:46.920
 And most people probably drop out through that system

3:29:46.920 --> 3:29:49.800
 because the fight is just not worth it for them.

3:29:49.800 --> 3:29:51.840
 Yeah, when you have the light in your eye,

3:29:51.840 --> 3:29:53.480
 when you have the excitement for the thing,

3:29:53.480 --> 3:29:56.560
 what happens is you start to surround yourself with others

3:29:56.560 --> 3:29:57.920
 that are interested in that same thing,

3:29:57.920 --> 3:29:59.160
 that also have the light.

3:29:59.160 --> 3:30:01.120
 If you really are rigorous about this

3:30:01.120 --> 3:30:05.440
 because I think it does take, it doesn't,

3:30:05.440 --> 3:30:07.360
 it takes effort to make.

3:30:07.360 --> 3:30:08.840
 Oh, you've got to be obsessive.

3:30:08.840 --> 3:30:11.280
 But if you're doing what you really love doing,

3:30:11.280 --> 3:30:13.320
 then it's not work anymore, it's what you do.

3:30:13.320 --> 3:30:15.600
 Yeah, but I also mean the surrounding yourself

3:30:15.600 --> 3:30:17.840
 with other people that are obsessed about the same thing

3:30:17.840 --> 3:30:19.080
 because depending on.

3:30:19.080 --> 3:30:21.040
 Oh, that takes some work as well, yes.

3:30:21.040 --> 3:30:21.880
 And luck.

3:30:21.880 --> 3:30:23.880
 Finding the right, yeah, finding the right mentors,

3:30:23.880 --> 3:30:27.600
 the collaborators, because I think one of the problem

3:30:27.600 --> 3:30:32.600
 with the PhD process is people are not careful enough

3:30:32.880 --> 3:30:34.840
 in picking their mentors.

3:30:34.840 --> 3:30:38.360
 Those are people, mentors and colleagues and so on,

3:30:38.360 --> 3:30:40.600
 those are people who are gonna define

3:30:40.600 --> 3:30:43.880
 the direction of your life, how much you love a thing,

3:30:43.880 --> 3:30:46.400
 how much, I mean the power of just like

3:30:46.400 --> 3:30:51.160
 the few little conversations you have in the hallway,

3:30:51.160 --> 3:30:52.360
 it's incredible.

3:30:52.360 --> 3:30:55.680
 So you have to be a little bit careful in that.

3:30:55.680 --> 3:30:58.080
 Sometimes you just get randomly almost assigned,

3:30:59.120 --> 3:31:04.120
 really pursue, I suppose, the subject

3:31:04.840 --> 3:31:07.480
 as much as you pursue the people that do that subject.

3:31:07.480 --> 3:31:09.480
 So like both, the whole dance of it.

3:31:09.480 --> 3:31:10.560
 They kind of go together really.

3:31:10.560 --> 3:31:11.960
 Yeah, they really do.

3:31:11.960 --> 3:31:14.720
 But take that part seriously.

3:31:14.720 --> 3:31:17.520
 And probably in the way you're describing it,

3:31:19.360 --> 3:31:21.800
 careful how you define success.

3:31:21.800 --> 3:31:22.640
 Because.

3:31:22.640 --> 3:31:24.800
 You'll never find happiness in success.

3:31:24.800 --> 3:31:27.560
 There's a lovely quote from Robert Louis Stevenson,

3:31:27.560 --> 3:31:29.320
 I think, who said, nothing in life

3:31:29.320 --> 3:31:31.420
 is so disenchanting as attainment.

3:31:33.160 --> 3:31:35.480
 Yeah, so I mean, in some sense,

3:31:35.480 --> 3:31:40.480
 the true definition of success is getting to do today

3:31:42.040 --> 3:31:43.600
 what you really enjoy doing.

3:31:43.600 --> 3:31:46.360
 Just what fills you with joy.

3:31:46.360 --> 3:31:48.120
 And that's ultimately success.

3:31:48.120 --> 3:31:51.520
 So success isn't the thing beyond the horizon,

3:31:51.520 --> 3:31:54.960
 the big trophy, the financials.

3:31:54.960 --> 3:31:57.760
 I think it's as close as we can get to happiness.

3:31:57.760 --> 3:31:59.800
 That's not to say you're full of joy all the time,

3:31:59.800 --> 3:32:01.680
 but it's as close as we can get

3:32:01.680 --> 3:32:03.620
 to a sustained human happiness

3:32:03.620 --> 3:32:05.300
 is by getting some fulfillment

3:32:05.300 --> 3:32:06.800
 from what you're doing on a daily basis.

3:32:06.800 --> 3:32:11.240
 And if what you're looking for is the world

3:32:11.240 --> 3:32:14.000
 giving you the stamp of approval with a Nobel Prize

3:32:14.000 --> 3:32:15.820
 or a fellowship or whatever it is,

3:32:15.820 --> 3:32:18.720
 then I've known people like this who,

3:32:18.720 --> 3:32:23.720
 they're eaten away by the anger,

3:32:24.480 --> 3:32:27.480
 the kind of caustic resentment

3:32:27.480 --> 3:32:31.080
 that they've not been awarded this prize that they deserve.

3:32:31.080 --> 3:32:32.960
 And the other way, if you put too much value

3:32:32.960 --> 3:32:35.480
 into those kinds of prizes and you win them,

3:32:35.480 --> 3:32:40.200
 I've gotten a chance to see that it also,

3:32:42.460 --> 3:32:45.560
 the more quote unquote successful you are in that sense,

3:32:45.560 --> 3:32:50.560
 the more you run the danger of growing ego

3:32:50.640 --> 3:32:54.560
 so big that you don't get to actually enjoy

3:32:54.560 --> 3:32:56.080
 the beauty of this life.

3:32:56.080 --> 3:32:58.620
 You start to believe that you figured it all out

3:32:58.620 --> 3:33:01.360
 as opposed to, I think what ultimately

3:33:01.360 --> 3:33:03.280
 the most fun thing is is being curious

3:33:03.280 --> 3:33:06.360
 about everything around you, being constantly surprised,

3:33:06.360 --> 3:33:08.520
 and these little moments of discovery

3:33:08.520 --> 3:33:12.120
 of enjoying beauty in small and big ways all around you.

3:33:12.120 --> 3:33:14.240
 And I think the bigger your ego grows,

3:33:14.240 --> 3:33:15.960
 the more you start to take yourself seriously,

3:33:15.960 --> 3:33:17.880
 the less you're able to enjoy that.

3:33:17.880 --> 3:33:19.720
 Amen to that, I couldn't agree more.

3:33:20.880 --> 3:33:25.720
 So the summary from harmless to mostly harmless

3:33:25.720 --> 3:33:27.640
 in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

3:33:27.640 --> 3:33:31.440
 how would you try to summarize Earth?

3:33:31.440 --> 3:33:34.440
 And if you were given,

3:33:34.440 --> 3:33:36.480
 if you had to summarize the whole thing

3:33:36.480 --> 3:33:38.560
 in a couple of sentences,

3:33:38.560 --> 3:33:40.400
 and maybe throw in meaning of life in there,

3:33:40.400 --> 3:33:45.400
 like what, why, why, why, maybe,

3:33:45.800 --> 3:33:47.600
 is that a defining thing about humans

3:33:47.600 --> 3:33:51.760
 that we care about the meaning of the whole thing?

3:33:52.600 --> 3:33:55.800
 I wonder if that should be part of the,

3:33:55.800 --> 3:33:58.720
 these creatures seem to be very lost.

3:33:58.720 --> 3:34:00.400
 Yes, they're always asking why.

3:34:00.400 --> 3:34:02.940
 I mean, that's my defining question is why.

3:34:02.940 --> 3:34:06.700
 It was, as people used to make a joke,

3:34:06.700 --> 3:34:08.600
 I have a small scar on my forehead

3:34:08.600 --> 3:34:11.160
 from a climbing accident years ago.

3:34:11.160 --> 3:34:13.760
 And the guy I was climbing with had dislodged a rock

3:34:13.760 --> 3:34:15.520
 and he shouted something.

3:34:15.520 --> 3:34:16.600
 He shouted below, I think,

3:34:16.600 --> 3:34:18.440
 meaning that the rock was coming down.

3:34:18.440 --> 3:34:20.280
 And I hadn't caught what he said,

3:34:20.280 --> 3:34:23.600
 so I looked up and then smashed the street on my forehead.

3:34:23.600 --> 3:34:27.920
 And everybody around me took the piss,

3:34:27.920 --> 3:34:30.280
 saying he looked up to ask why.

3:34:30.280 --> 3:34:33.000
 Yeah.

3:34:33.000 --> 3:34:34.600
 But that's a human imperative.

3:34:34.600 --> 3:34:37.220
 That's part of what it means to be human.

3:34:37.220 --> 3:34:40.580
 Look up to the sky and ask why, and ask why.

3:34:42.200 --> 3:34:44.600
 So your question, define the earth.

3:34:49.200 --> 3:34:50.440
 I'm not sure I can do that.

3:34:50.440 --> 3:34:52.940
 I mean, the first word that comes to mind is living.

3:34:54.840 --> 3:34:57.880
 I wouldn't like to say mostly living, but perhaps.

3:34:57.880 --> 3:34:58.720
 Mostly living.

3:34:58.720 --> 3:35:00.200
 Well, it's interesting because like,

3:35:00.200 --> 3:35:04.120
 if you were to write the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

3:35:04.120 --> 3:35:09.120
 I suppose, say our idea that we talked about,

3:35:10.320 --> 3:35:13.640
 that bacteria is the most prominent form of life

3:35:13.640 --> 3:35:16.420
 throughout the galaxy and the universe.

3:35:17.920 --> 3:35:21.720
 I suppose that earth would be kind of unique

3:35:21.720 --> 3:35:22.560
 and would require.

3:35:22.560 --> 3:35:24.440
 There's abundance in that case.

3:35:24.440 --> 3:35:25.280
 Yeah.

3:35:25.280 --> 3:35:28.280
 It's profligate, it's rich, it's enormously,

3:35:28.280 --> 3:35:29.920
 enormously living.

3:35:29.920 --> 3:35:33.400
 So how would you describe that it's not bacteria?

3:35:33.400 --> 3:35:34.240
 It's.

3:35:36.560 --> 3:35:37.680
 Eukaryotic.

3:35:37.680 --> 3:35:39.560
 Yeah.

3:35:39.560 --> 3:35:41.700
 Well, I mean, that's the technical term,

3:35:41.700 --> 3:35:43.000
 but it is basically it's.

3:35:46.400 --> 3:35:47.240
 Yeah, and then.

3:35:47.240 --> 3:35:49.280
 How would I describe that?

3:35:49.280 --> 3:35:52.160
 I've actually really struggled with that term

3:35:52.160 --> 3:35:55.400
 because the word, I mean, there's few words

3:35:55.400 --> 3:35:58.600
 quite as good as eukaryotic to put everybody off immediately.

3:35:58.600 --> 3:35:59.880
 You start using words like that

3:35:59.880 --> 3:36:01.520
 and they'll leave the room.

3:36:01.520 --> 3:36:03.680
 A Krebs cycle is another one that gets people

3:36:03.680 --> 3:36:08.360
 to leave the room, but so I've tried to think,

3:36:08.360 --> 3:36:10.840
 is there another word for eukaryotic that I can use?

3:36:10.840 --> 3:36:13.200
 And really the only word that I've been able to use

3:36:13.200 --> 3:36:18.200
 is complex, complex cells, complex life and so on.

3:36:18.760 --> 3:36:22.860
 And that word, it serves one immediate purpose,

3:36:22.860 --> 3:36:26.240
 which is to convey an impression.

3:36:26.240 --> 3:36:31.240
 But then it means so many different things to everybody

3:36:31.240 --> 3:36:33.640
 that actually is lost immediately.

3:36:33.640 --> 3:36:35.160
 And so it's kind of.

3:36:36.320 --> 3:36:38.480
 Well, that's a noticeable from the perspective

3:36:38.480 --> 3:36:42.020
 of other planets, that is a noticeable phase transition

3:36:42.020 --> 3:36:44.520
 of complexity is the eukaryotic.

3:36:46.760 --> 3:36:49.240
 What about the harmless and the mostly harmless?

3:36:49.240 --> 3:36:50.160
 Is that kind of.

3:36:51.680 --> 3:36:55.480
 Probably accurate on a universal kind of scale.

3:36:55.480 --> 3:36:59.240
 I don't think that humanity is in any danger

3:36:59.240 --> 3:37:02.160
 of disturbing the universe at the moment.

3:37:02.160 --> 3:37:06.240
 At the moment, which is why the mostly, we don't know.

3:37:06.240 --> 3:37:10.000
 Depends what Elon is up to, depends how many rockets.

3:37:10.000 --> 3:37:10.840
 I think.

3:37:10.840 --> 3:37:13.840
 It'll be still even then a while, I think,

3:37:13.840 --> 3:37:17.700
 before we disturb the fabric of time and space.

3:37:17.700 --> 3:37:20.360
 Was the aforementioned Andrej Karpathy,

3:37:20.360 --> 3:37:25.360
 I think he summarized Earth as a system

3:37:25.360 --> 3:37:30.120
 where you hammer it with a bunch of photons.

3:37:30.120 --> 3:37:33.520
 The input is like photons and the output is rockets.

3:37:35.520 --> 3:37:37.080
 If you just.

3:37:37.080 --> 3:37:38.440
 Well, that's a hell of a lot of photons

3:37:38.440 --> 3:37:40.240
 before there was a rocket launch.

3:37:40.240 --> 3:37:43.920
 But like, you know, maybe in the span of the universe,

3:37:43.920 --> 3:37:46.080
 it's not that much time.

3:37:46.080 --> 3:37:49.900
 And so, and I do wonder, you know, what the future is,

3:37:49.900 --> 3:37:52.960
 whether we're just in the early beginnings of this Earth,

3:37:52.960 --> 3:37:55.440
 which is important when you try to summarize it,

3:37:55.440 --> 3:37:59.920
 or we're at the end, where humans have finally

3:37:59.920 --> 3:38:02.680
 gained the ability to destroy the entirety

3:38:02.680 --> 3:38:05.240
 of this beautiful project we've got going on.

3:38:06.120 --> 3:38:09.160
 Not with nuclear weapons, with engineered viruses,

3:38:09.160 --> 3:38:10.240
 with all those kinds of things.

3:38:10.240 --> 3:38:12.460
 Or just inadvertently through global warming

3:38:12.460 --> 3:38:14.020
 and pollution and so on.

3:38:15.000 --> 3:38:15.920
 We're quite capable of that.

3:38:15.920 --> 3:38:18.520
 I mean, we just need to pass the tipping point.

3:38:18.520 --> 3:38:20.880
 I mean, I think we're more likely to do it inadvertently

3:38:20.880 --> 3:38:24.520
 than through a nuclear war, which could happen at any time.

3:38:24.520 --> 3:38:29.520
 But my fear is we just don't know

3:38:30.280 --> 3:38:31.560
 where the tipping points are.

3:38:31.560 --> 3:38:35.400
 And we will, we kind of think we're smart enough

3:38:35.400 --> 3:38:37.480
 to fix the problem quickly if we really need to.

3:38:37.480 --> 3:38:40.260
 I think that's the overriding assumption

3:38:40.260 --> 3:38:43.000
 that we're all right for now.

3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:45.740
 Maybe in 20 years time, it's gonna be a calamitous problem.

3:38:45.740 --> 3:38:47.900
 And then we'll really need to put some serious mental power

3:38:47.900 --> 3:38:51.400
 into fixing it without seriously worrying

3:38:51.400 --> 3:38:53.720
 that perhaps that is too late.

3:38:53.720 --> 3:38:58.660
 And that however brilliant we are, we miss the boat.

3:38:59.600 --> 3:39:01.720
 And just walk off the cliff.

3:39:01.720 --> 3:39:02.560
 I don't know.

3:39:02.560 --> 3:39:05.960
 I have optimism in humans being clever descendants.

3:39:05.960 --> 3:39:09.640
 Oh, I have no doubt that we can fix the problem.

3:39:09.640 --> 3:39:10.760
 It's an urgent problem.

3:39:11.780 --> 3:39:14.080
 We need to fix it pretty sharpish.

3:39:14.080 --> 3:39:16.760
 And I do have doubts about whether politically

3:39:16.760 --> 3:39:18.640
 we are capable of coming together enough

3:39:18.640 --> 3:39:23.640
 to not just in any one country, but around the planet.

3:39:23.840 --> 3:39:26.960
 To, I mean, I know we can do it, but do we have the will?

3:39:26.960 --> 3:39:31.280
 Do we have the vision to accomplish it?

3:39:31.280 --> 3:39:33.920
 That's what makes this whole ride fun.

3:39:33.920 --> 3:39:35.040
 I don't know.

3:39:35.040 --> 3:39:37.280
 Not only do we not know if we can handle

3:39:37.280 --> 3:39:40.760
 the crises before us, we don't even know all the crises

3:39:40.760 --> 3:39:43.960
 that are gonna be before us in the next 20 years.

3:39:43.960 --> 3:39:48.360
 The ones I think that will most likely challenge us

3:39:48.360 --> 3:39:51.280
 in the 21st century are the ones we don't even expect.

3:39:51.280 --> 3:39:53.240
 People didn't expect World War II

3:39:53.240 --> 3:39:54.620
 at the end of World War I.

3:39:56.200 --> 3:39:58.720
 Some folks did, but yeah, not at the end of World War I.

3:39:58.720 --> 3:40:01.600
 But by the late 1920s, I think people

3:40:01.600 --> 3:40:03.040
 were beginning to worry about it.

3:40:03.040 --> 3:40:05.960
 Yeah, no, there's always people worrying about everything.

3:40:05.960 --> 3:40:08.000
 So if you focus on the thing that.

3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:09.600
 People worry about, yes.

3:40:09.600 --> 3:40:11.400
 Because there's a million things people worry about

3:40:11.400 --> 3:40:14.840
 and 99.999999% of them don't come to be.

3:40:14.840 --> 3:40:16.680
 Of course, the people that turn out to be right,

3:40:16.680 --> 3:40:19.560
 they'll say, I knew all along, but that's not,

3:40:19.560 --> 3:40:21.000
 that's not an accurate way of knowing

3:40:21.000 --> 3:40:22.440
 what you could have predicted.

3:40:22.440 --> 3:40:25.600
 I think rationally speaking, you can worry about it,

3:40:25.600 --> 3:40:28.160
 but nobody thought you could have another World War.

3:40:28.160 --> 3:40:31.320
 The war to end all wars, why would you have another war?

3:40:31.320 --> 3:40:33.620
 And the idea of nuclear weapons,

3:40:34.560 --> 3:40:37.400
 just technologically, is a very difficult thing

3:40:37.400 --> 3:40:39.680
 to anticipate, to create a weapon

3:40:39.680 --> 3:40:41.640
 that just jumps orders of magnitude

3:40:41.640 --> 3:40:43.880
 and destructive capability.

3:40:43.880 --> 3:40:46.240
 And of course, we can intuit all the things

3:40:46.240 --> 3:40:49.260
 like engineered viruses, nanobots,

3:40:49.260 --> 3:40:54.260
 artificial intelligence, yes, all the different

3:40:54.320 --> 3:40:57.320
 complicated global effects of global warming.

3:40:57.320 --> 3:40:59.460
 So how that changes the allocation of resources,

3:40:59.460 --> 3:41:02.720
 the flow of energy, the tension between countries,

3:41:02.720 --> 3:41:04.480
 the military conflict between countries,

3:41:04.480 --> 3:41:06.760
 the reallocation of power,

3:41:06.760 --> 3:41:09.340
 then looking at the role of China in this whole thing

3:41:09.340 --> 3:41:13.600
 with Russia and growing influence of Africa

3:41:13.600 --> 3:41:16.200
 and the weird dynamics of Europe,

3:41:16.200 --> 3:41:19.440
 and then America falling apart through the political

3:41:19.440 --> 3:41:22.720
 division fueled by recommender systems

3:41:22.720 --> 3:41:24.140
 through Twitter and Facebook.

3:41:24.140 --> 3:41:26.920
 The whole beautiful mess is just fun.

3:41:26.920 --> 3:41:30.240
 And I think there's a lot of incredible engineers,

3:41:30.240 --> 3:41:32.920
 incredible scientists, incredible human beings

3:41:32.920 --> 3:41:36.140
 that while everyone is bickering and so on online

3:41:36.140 --> 3:41:37.780
 for the fun of it on the weekends,

3:41:37.780 --> 3:41:39.320
 they're actually trying to build solutions.

3:41:39.320 --> 3:41:41.340
 And those are the people that will create

3:41:41.340 --> 3:41:42.180
 something beautiful.

3:41:42.180 --> 3:41:45.660
 At least I have, that's the process of evolution.

3:41:45.660 --> 3:41:50.660
 It all started with a Chuck Norris single cell organism

3:41:53.520 --> 3:41:56.520
 that went out from the vents and was the parent

3:41:56.520 --> 3:41:57.880
 to all of us.

3:41:57.880 --> 3:42:01.800
 And for that guy or lady or both, I guess,

3:42:01.800 --> 3:42:05.820
 is a big thank you and I can't wait to what happens next.

3:42:05.820 --> 3:42:08.440
 And I'm glad there's incredible humans writing

3:42:08.440 --> 3:42:10.000
 and studying it like you are, Nick.

3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:12.240
 It's a huge honor that you would talk to me.

3:42:12.240 --> 3:42:13.280
 This is fantastic.

3:42:13.280 --> 3:42:14.360
 This is really amazing.

3:42:14.360 --> 3:42:17.860
 I can't wait to read what you write next.

3:42:17.860 --> 3:42:19.260
 Thank you for existing.

3:42:21.520 --> 3:42:24.600
 And thank you for talking today.

3:42:24.600 --> 3:42:26.280
 Thank you.

3:42:26.280 --> 3:42:28.800
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Nick Lane.

3:42:28.800 --> 3:42:31.280

3:42:32.680 --> 3:42:37.600
 And now let me leave you with some words from Steve Jobs.

3:42:37.600 --> 3:42:40.720
 I think the biggest innovations of the 21st century

3:42:40.720 --> 3:42:45.720
 will be at the intersection of biology and technology.

3:42:45.820 --> 3:42:47.860
 A new era is beginning.

3:42:47.860 --> 3:43:02.860
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
