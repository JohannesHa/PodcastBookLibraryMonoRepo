00:00.000 --> 00:02.980
 The following is a conversation with David Eagleman,

00:02.980 --> 00:06.360
 a neuroscientist and one of the great science communicators

00:06.360 --> 00:09.260
 of our time, exploring the beauty and mystery

00:09.260 --> 00:10.780
 of the human brain.

00:10.780 --> 00:13.140
 He's an author of a lot of amazing books

00:13.140 --> 00:18.060
 about the human mind, and his new one called Livewired.

00:18.060 --> 00:21.200
 Livewired is a work of 10 years on a topic

00:21.200 --> 00:24.700
 that is fascinating to me, which is neuroplasticity

00:24.700 --> 00:26.780
 or the malleability of the human brain.

00:27.740 --> 00:29.260

00:37.820 --> 00:41.420
 As a side note, let me say that the adaptability

00:41.420 --> 00:44.380
 of the human mind at the biological, chemical,

00:44.380 --> 00:48.500
 cognitive, psychological, and even sociological levels

00:48.500 --> 00:51.860
 is the very thing that captivated me many years ago

00:51.860 --> 00:54.980
 when I first began to wonder how would my engineer

00:54.980 --> 00:57.760
 something like it in the machine.

00:57.760 --> 01:00.700
 The open question today in the 21st century

01:00.700 --> 01:03.700
 is what are the limits of this adaptability?

01:03.700 --> 01:07.420
 As new, smarter and smarter devices and AI systems

01:07.420 --> 01:10.420
 come to life, or as better and better brain computer

01:10.420 --> 01:13.820
 interfaces are engineered, will our brain be able to adapt,

01:13.820 --> 01:16.580
 to catch up, to excel?

01:16.580 --> 01:19.540
 I personally believe yes, that we're far from reaching

01:19.540 --> 01:23.100
 the limitation of the human mind and the human brain,

01:23.100 --> 01:26.060
 just as we are far from reaching the limitations

01:26.060 --> 01:27.900
 of our computational systems.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.020
 all of your nutritional bases.

02:07.020 --> 02:09.140
 That's where Athletic Greens will help.

02:09.140 --> 02:11.820
 Their daily drink is like nutritional insurance

02:11.820 --> 02:15.380
 for your body as delivered straight to your door.

02:15.380 --> 02:18.580
 As you may know, I fast often, sometimes intermittent fasting

02:18.580 --> 02:21.860
 for 16 hours, sometimes 24 hours,

02:21.860 --> 02:24.500
 dinner to dinner, sometimes more.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.900
 I break the fast with Athletic Greens.

02:26.900 --> 02:30.980
 It's delicious, refreshing, just makes me feel good.

02:30.980 --> 02:34.380
 I think it's like 50 calories, less than a gram of sugar,

02:34.380 --> 02:36.460
 but has a ton of nutrients to make sure my body

02:36.460 --> 02:40.200
 has what it needs despite what I'm eating.

 you might've listened to him rant about

02:53.340 --> 02:56.140
 how awesome vitamin D is for your immune system.

03:19.340 --> 03:21.820
 It's not a crisis line, it's not self help,

03:21.820 --> 03:25.500
 it's professional counseling done securely online.

03:25.500 --> 03:28.100
 I'm a bit from the David Goggins line of creatures

03:28.100 --> 03:30.680
 and so have some demons to contend with,

03:30.680 --> 03:34.940
 usually on long runs or all nights full of self doubt.

03:34.940 --> 03:37.880
 I think suffering is essential for creation,

03:37.880 --> 03:39.540
 but you can suffer beautifully

03:39.540 --> 03:41.660
 in a way that doesn't destroy you.

03:41.660 --> 03:45.300
 For most people, I think a good therapist can help on this.

03:45.300 --> 03:47.140
 So it's at least worth a try.

03:47.140 --> 03:49.260
 Check out their reviews, they're good.

03:49.260 --> 03:52.660
 It's easy, private, affordable, available worldwide.

03:52.660 --> 03:54.760
 You can communicate by text anytime

03:54.760 --> 03:58.280
 and schedule a weekly audio and video session.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.520

04:02.420 --> 04:04.620
 This show is presented by Cash App,

04:04.620 --> 04:06.660
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

04:06.660 --> 04:09.280
 When you get it, use code lexpodcast.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.660
 Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin,

04:11.660 --> 04:14.540
 invest in the stock market with as little as $1.

04:14.540 --> 04:16.880
 Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,

04:16.880 --> 04:18.480
 let me mention that cryptocurrency

04:18.480 --> 04:21.860
 in the context of the history of money is fascinating.

04:21.860 --> 04:25.420
 I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.

04:25.420 --> 04:29.980
 Davidson credits on ledgers started around 30,000 years ago

04:29.980 --> 04:32.260
 and the first decentralized cryptocurrency

04:32.260 --> 04:34.220
 released just over 10 years ago.

04:34.220 --> 04:37.420
 So given that history, cryptocurrency is still very much

04:37.420 --> 04:39.340
 in its early days of development,

04:39.340 --> 04:40.700
 but it's still aiming to

04:40.700 --> 04:43.880
 and just might redefine the nature of money.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.900
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play

04:47.900 --> 04:51.020
 and use code lexpodcast, you get $10

04:51.020 --> 04:53.940
 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,

04:53.940 --> 04:56.980
 an organization that is helping to advance robotics

04:56.980 --> 05:00.420
 and STEM education for young people around the world.

05:00.420 --> 05:04.620
 And now here's my conversation with David Eagleman.

05:05.780 --> 05:10.360
 You have a new book coming out on the changing brain.

05:10.360 --> 05:13.260
 Can you give a high level overview of the book?

05:13.260 --> 05:14.620
 It's called Livewired by the way.

05:14.620 --> 05:17.780
 Yeah, the thing is we typically think about the brain

05:17.780 --> 05:19.500
 in terms of the metaphors we already have,

05:19.500 --> 05:21.820
 like hardware and software, that's how we build

05:21.820 --> 05:24.420
 all our stuff, but what's happening in the brain

05:24.420 --> 05:26.860
 is fundamentally so different.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.060
 So I coined this new term liveware,

05:29.060 --> 05:32.400
 which is a system that's constantly reconfiguring itself

05:32.400 --> 05:37.100
 physically as it learns and adapts to the world around it.

05:37.100 --> 05:38.660
 It's physically changing.

05:38.660 --> 05:43.620
 So it's liveware meaning like hardware but changing.

05:43.620 --> 05:44.560
 Yeah, exactly.

05:44.560 --> 05:47.500
 Well, the hardware and the software layers are blended

05:47.500 --> 05:52.500
 and so typically engineers are praised for their efficiency

05:53.660 --> 05:55.220
 and making something really clean and clear,

05:55.220 --> 05:56.380
 like, okay, here's the hardware layer,

05:56.380 --> 05:57.780
 then I'm gonna run software on top of it.

05:57.780 --> 06:00.300
 And there's all sorts of universality that you get out

06:00.300 --> 06:02.840
 of a piece of hardware like that that's useful.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.240
 But what the brain is doing is completely different.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.360
 And I am so excited about where this is all going

06:08.360 --> 06:13.360
 because I feel like this is where our engineering will go.

06:13.360 --> 06:17.140
 So currently we build all our devices a particular way,

06:17.140 --> 06:20.620
 but I can't tear half the circuitry out of your cell phone

06:20.620 --> 06:22.660
 and expect it to still function.

06:22.660 --> 06:26.460
 But you can do that with the brain.

06:26.460 --> 06:29.260
 So just as an example, kids who are under

06:29.260 --> 06:32.060
 about seven years old can get one half of their brain

06:32.060 --> 06:35.700
 removed, it's called a hemispherectomy, and they're fine.

06:35.700 --> 06:37.420
 They have a slight limp on the other side of their body,

06:37.420 --> 06:40.540
 but they can function just fine that way.

06:40.540 --> 06:42.380
 And this is generally true.

06:42.380 --> 06:45.220
 You know, sometimes children are born without a hemisphere

06:45.220 --> 06:48.580
 and their visual system rewires so that everything is

06:48.580 --> 06:52.140
 on the single remaining hemisphere.

06:52.140 --> 06:55.420
 What thousands of cases like this teach us

06:55.420 --> 06:59.940
 is that it's a very malleable system that is simply trying

06:59.940 --> 07:04.060
 to accomplish the tasks in front of it by rewiring itself

07:04.060 --> 07:06.100
 with the available real estate.

07:06.100 --> 07:09.860
 How much of that is a quirk or a feature of evolution?

07:09.860 --> 07:11.860
 Like, how hard is it to engineer?

07:11.860 --> 07:14.620
 Because evolution took a lot of work.

07:14.620 --> 07:18.500
 Trillions of organisms had to die for it to create

07:18.500 --> 07:21.580
 this thing we have in our skull.

07:21.580 --> 07:24.540
 Like, because you said you kind of look forward to the idea

07:24.540 --> 07:27.940
 that we might be engineering our systems like this

07:27.940 --> 07:30.740
 in the future, like creating liveware systems.

07:30.740 --> 07:33.180
 How hard do you think is it to create systems like that?

07:33.180 --> 07:34.020
 Great question.

07:34.020 --> 07:37.060
 It has proven itself to be a difficult challenge.

07:37.060 --> 07:40.260
 What I mean by that is even though it's taken evolution

07:40.260 --> 07:43.180
 a really long time to get where it is now,

07:44.260 --> 07:47.620
 all we have to do now is peek at the blueprints.

07:47.620 --> 07:49.620
 It's just three pounds, this organ,

07:49.620 --> 07:50.860
 and we just figure out how to do it.

07:50.860 --> 07:52.760
 But that's the part that I mean is a difficult challenge

07:52.760 --> 07:57.100
 because there are tens of thousands of neuroscientists,

07:57.100 --> 07:59.260
 we're all poking and prodding and trying to figure this out,

07:59.260 --> 08:00.700
 but it's an extremely complicated system.

08:00.700 --> 08:03.300
 But it's only gonna be complicated until we figure out

08:03.300 --> 08:05.380
 the general principles.

08:05.380 --> 08:09.420
 Exactly like if you had a magic camera

08:09.420 --> 08:10.940
 you could look inside the nucleus of a cell

08:10.940 --> 08:13.220
 and you'd see hundreds of thousands of things

08:13.220 --> 08:14.180
 moving around or whatever,

08:14.180 --> 08:16.060
 and then it takes Crick and Watson to say,

08:16.060 --> 08:17.380
 oh, you know what, you're just trying to maintain

08:17.380 --> 08:20.300
 the order of the base pairs and all the rest is details.

08:20.300 --> 08:23.500
 Then it simplifies it and we come to understand something.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.100
 That was my goal in LiveWire,

08:25.100 --> 08:26.900
 which I've written over 10 years, by the way,

08:26.900 --> 08:29.920
 is to try to distill things down to the principles

08:29.920 --> 08:34.180
 of what plastic systems are trying to accomplish.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.260
 But to even just linger, you said,

08:36.260 --> 08:38.820
 it's possible to be born with just one hemisphere

08:38.820 --> 08:41.940
 and you still are able to function.

08:41.940 --> 08:43.460
 First of all, just to pause on that,

08:43.460 --> 08:45.660
 I mean, that's kind of, that's amazing.

08:47.940 --> 08:50.100
 I don't know if people quite,

08:50.100 --> 08:51.740
 I mean, you kind of hear things here and there.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.300
 This is why I'm kind of, I'm really excited about your book

08:54.300 --> 08:59.300
 is I don't know if there's definitive sort of popular sources

09:00.020 --> 09:01.500
 to think about this stuff.

09:01.500 --> 09:05.060
 I mean, there's a lot of, I think from my perspective,

09:05.060 --> 09:07.940
 what I heard is there's like been debates over decades

09:07.940 --> 09:12.060
 about how much neuroplasticity there is in the brain

09:12.060 --> 09:14.860
 and so on, and people have learned a lot of things

09:14.860 --> 09:16.900
 and now it's converging towards people

09:16.900 --> 09:20.380
 that are understanding there's much more plastic

09:20.380 --> 09:21.440
 than people realize.

09:21.440 --> 09:23.900
 But just like linger on that topic,

09:23.900 --> 09:28.380
 like how malleable is the hardware of the human brain?

09:28.380 --> 09:32.300
 Maybe you said children at each stage of life.

09:32.300 --> 09:33.680
 Yeah, so here's the whole thing.

09:33.680 --> 09:36.960
 I think part of the confusion about plasticity

09:36.960 --> 09:38.220
 has been that there are studies

09:38.220 --> 09:40.340
 at all sorts of different ages,

09:40.340 --> 09:42.400
 and then people might read that from a distance

09:42.400 --> 09:45.360
 and they think, oh, well, Fred didn't recover

09:45.360 --> 09:47.060
 when half his brain was taken out

09:47.060 --> 09:49.020
 and so clearly you're not plastic,

09:49.020 --> 09:52.180
 but then you do it with a child and they are plastic.

09:52.180 --> 09:56.420
 And so part of my goal here was to pull together

09:56.420 --> 09:59.060
 the tens of thousands of papers on this,

09:59.060 --> 10:02.460
 both from clinical work and from all the way down

10:02.460 --> 10:04.140
 to the molecular and understand

10:04.140 --> 10:04.980
 what are the principles here?

10:04.980 --> 10:08.260
 The principles are that plasticity diminishes,

10:08.260 --> 10:09.540
 that's no surprise.

10:09.540 --> 10:11.540
 By the way, maybe I should just define plasticity.

10:11.540 --> 10:14.840
 It's the ability of a system to mold into a new shape

10:14.840 --> 10:16.260
 and then hold that shape.

10:16.260 --> 10:19.860
 That's why we make things that we call plastic

10:20.740 --> 10:23.620
 because they are moldable and they can hold that new shape,

10:23.620 --> 10:25.240
 like a plastic toy or something.

10:25.240 --> 10:29.480
 And so maybe we'll use a lot of terms that are synonymous.

10:29.480 --> 10:34.460
 So something is plastic, something is malleable,

10:34.460 --> 10:38.740
 changing, live wire, the name of the book is like synonyms.

10:38.740 --> 10:39.880
 So I'll tell you, exactly right,

10:39.880 --> 10:41.740
 but I'll tell you why I chose live wire

10:41.740 --> 10:42.980
 instead of plasticity.

10:42.980 --> 10:47.140
 So I use the term plasticity in the book, but sparingly,

10:47.140 --> 10:51.060
 because that was a term coined by William James

10:51.060 --> 10:53.980
 over a hundred years ago and he was, of course,

10:53.980 --> 10:55.820
 very impressed with plastic manufacturing

10:55.820 --> 10:57.660
 that you could mold something into shape

10:57.660 --> 10:58.540
 and then it holds that.

10:58.540 --> 11:01.420
 But that's not what's actually happening in the brain.

11:01.420 --> 11:03.700
 It's constantly rewiring your entire life.

11:03.700 --> 11:06.380
 You never hit an end point.

11:06.380 --> 11:08.220
 The whole point is for it to keep changing.

11:08.220 --> 11:11.020
 So even in the few minutes of conversation

11:11.020 --> 11:12.560
 that we've been having, your brain is changing,

11:12.560 --> 11:13.820
 my brain is changing.

11:15.460 --> 11:18.020
 Next time I see your face, I will remember,

11:18.020 --> 11:19.860
 oh yeah, like that time Lex and I sat together

11:19.860 --> 11:21.420
 and we did these things.

11:21.420 --> 11:24.020
 I wonder if your brain will have like a Lex thing

11:24.020 --> 11:25.300
 going on for the next few months.

11:25.300 --> 11:27.860
 Like it'll stay there until you get rid of it

11:27.860 --> 11:29.340
 because it was useful for now.

11:29.340 --> 11:30.820
 Yeah, no, I'll probably never get rid of it.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.000
 Let's say for some circumstance,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.300
 you and I don't see each other for the next 35 years.

11:34.300 --> 11:36.220
 When I run into you, I'll be like, oh yeah.

11:36.220 --> 11:37.460
 That looks familiar.

11:37.460 --> 11:40.420
 Yeah, yeah, we sat down for a podcast

11:40.420 --> 11:42.460
 back when there were podcasts.

11:42.460 --> 11:43.300
 Exactly.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.260
 Back when we lived outside virtual reality.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.020
 Exactly.

11:47.020 --> 11:50.180
 So you chose live wire to mold a plastic.

11:50.180 --> 11:52.820
 Exactly, because plastic implies,

11:52.820 --> 11:54.380
 I mean, it's the term that's used in the field

11:54.380 --> 11:57.780
 and so that's why we need to use it still for a while.

11:57.780 --> 11:59.620
 But yeah, it implies something gets molded into shape

11:59.620 --> 12:00.780
 and then holds that shape forever.

12:00.780 --> 12:03.220
 But in fact, the whole system is completely changing.

12:03.220 --> 12:07.700
 Then back to how malleable is the human brain

12:07.700 --> 12:08.820
 at each stage of life.

12:08.820 --> 12:13.820
 So what, just at a high level, is it malleable?

12:13.940 --> 12:17.220
 So yes, and plasticity diminishes.

12:17.220 --> 12:19.900
 But one of the things that I felt like

12:19.900 --> 12:21.740
 I was able to put together for myself

12:21.740 --> 12:23.900
 after reading thousands of papers on this issue

12:23.900 --> 12:26.880
 is that different parts of the brain

12:26.880 --> 12:30.820
 have different plasticity windows.

12:30.820 --> 12:33.140
 So for example, with the visual cortex,

12:33.140 --> 12:35.940
 that cements itself into place pretty quickly

12:35.940 --> 12:37.740
 over the course of a few years.

12:37.740 --> 12:41.020
 And I argue that's because of the stability of the data.

12:41.020 --> 12:43.940
 In other words, what you're getting in from the world,

12:43.940 --> 12:47.220
 you've got a certain number of angles, colors, shapes.

12:47.220 --> 12:49.940
 It's essentially the world is visually stable.

12:49.940 --> 12:52.420
 So that hardens around that data.

12:52.420 --> 12:55.100
 As opposed to, let's say, the somatosensory cortex,

12:55.100 --> 12:56.540
 which is the part that's taking information

12:56.540 --> 12:58.580
 from your body, or the motor cortex right next to it,

12:58.580 --> 13:00.380
 which is what drives your body.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.880
 The fact is, bodies are always changing.

13:01.880 --> 13:05.100
 You get taller over time, you get fatter, thinner,

13:05.100 --> 13:06.980
 over time, you might break a leg

13:06.980 --> 13:08.560
 and have to limp for a while, stuff like that.

13:08.560 --> 13:11.740
 So because the data there is always changing,

13:11.740 --> 13:12.900
 by the way, you might get on a bicycle,

13:12.900 --> 13:15.660
 you might get on a surfboard, things like that.

13:15.660 --> 13:16.780
 Because the data is always changing,

13:16.780 --> 13:18.300
 that stays more malleable.

13:19.260 --> 13:20.860
 And when you look through the brain,

13:20.860 --> 13:23.940
 you find that it appears to be this,

13:23.940 --> 13:26.660
 how stable the data is determines how fast

13:26.660 --> 13:28.060
 something hardens into place.

13:28.060 --> 13:30.000
 But the point is, different parts of the brain

13:30.000 --> 13:31.940
 harden into place at different times.

13:31.940 --> 13:33.840
 Do you think it's possible that,

13:35.020 --> 13:38.700
 depending on how much data you get on different sensors,

13:38.700 --> 13:41.480
 that it stays more malleable longer?

13:41.480 --> 13:44.220
 So like, if you look at different cultures

13:44.220 --> 13:47.580
 that experience, like if you keep your eyes closed,

13:47.580 --> 13:48.860
 or maybe you're blind, I don't know,

13:48.860 --> 13:51.180
 but let's say you keep your eyes closed

13:51.180 --> 13:55.820
 for your entire life, then the visual cortex

13:55.820 --> 13:58.660
 might be much less malleable.

13:58.660 --> 14:01.300
 The reason I bring that up is like,

14:01.300 --> 14:03.340
 well maybe we'll talk about brain computer interfaces

14:03.340 --> 14:07.400
 a little bit down the line, but is this,

14:08.500 --> 14:11.300
 is the malleability a genetic thing,

14:11.300 --> 14:14.380
 or is it more about the data, like you said, that comes in?

14:14.380 --> 14:17.980
 Ah, so the malleability itself is a genetic thing.

14:17.980 --> 14:20.840
 The big trick that Mother Nature discovered with humans

14:20.840 --> 14:24.220
 is make a system that's really flexible,

14:24.220 --> 14:28.100
 as opposed to most other creatures to different degrees.

14:28.100 --> 14:31.220
 So if you take an alligator, it's born,

14:31.220 --> 14:34.180
 its brain does the same thing every generation.

14:34.180 --> 14:36.220
 If you compare an alligator 100,000 years ago

14:36.220 --> 14:38.460
 to an alligator now, they're essentially the same.

14:39.660 --> 14:41.360
 We, on the other hand, as humans,

14:41.360 --> 14:44.220
 drop into a world with a half baked brain,

14:44.220 --> 14:48.180
 and what we require is to absorb the culture around us,

14:48.180 --> 14:50.300
 and the language, and the beliefs, and the customs,

14:50.300 --> 14:55.060
 and so on, that's what Mother Nature has done with us,

14:55.060 --> 14:57.340
 and it's been a tremendously successful trick

14:57.340 --> 15:00.120
 we've taken over the whole planet as a result of this.

15:00.120 --> 15:01.220
 So that's an interesting point,

15:01.220 --> 15:03.140
 I mean, just to link on it, that,

15:03.140 --> 15:05.400
 I mean, this is a nice feature,

15:05.400 --> 15:07.060
 like if you were to design a thing

15:07.060 --> 15:11.780
 to survive in this world, do you put it at age zero

15:11.780 --> 15:14.580
 already equipped to deal with the world

15:14.580 --> 15:17.740
 in a hard coded way, or do you put it,

15:17.740 --> 15:19.580
 do you make it malleable and just throw it in,

15:19.580 --> 15:23.380
 take the risk that you're maybe going to die,

15:23.380 --> 15:25.220
 but you're going to learn a lot in the process,

15:25.220 --> 15:27.620
 and if you don't die, you'll learn a hell of a lot

15:27.620 --> 15:29.300
 to be able to survive in the environment.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.340
 So this is the experiment that Mother Nature ran,

15:31.340 --> 15:34.980
 and it turns out that, for better or worse, we've won.

15:34.980 --> 15:37.500
 I mean, yeah, we put other animals in the zoos,

15:37.500 --> 15:38.620
 and we, yeah, that's right.

15:38.620 --> 15:39.580
 AI might do better.

15:39.580 --> 15:41.320
 Okay, fair enough, that's true.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.620
 And maybe what the trick Mother Nature did

15:43.620 --> 15:46.660
 is just the stepping stone to AI, but.

15:46.660 --> 15:50.220
 So that's a beautiful feature of the human brain,

15:50.220 --> 15:52.420
 that it's malleable, but let's,

15:52.420 --> 15:56.380
 on the topic of Mother Nature, what do we start with?

15:56.380 --> 15:58.420
 Like, how blank is the slate?

15:58.420 --> 16:01.060
 Ah, so it's not actually a blank slate.

16:01.060 --> 16:05.340
 What it's, it's terrific engineering that's set up in there,

16:05.340 --> 16:07.700
 but much of that engineering has to do with,

16:07.700 --> 16:10.100
 okay, just make sure that things get to the right place.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.260
 For example, like the fibers from the eyes

16:12.260 --> 16:13.840
 getting to the visual cortex,

16:13.840 --> 16:15.640
 or all this very complicated machinery in the ear

16:15.640 --> 16:17.700
 getting to the auditory cortex, and so on.

16:17.700 --> 16:19.860
 So things, first of all, there's that.

16:19.860 --> 16:21.520
 And then what we also come equipped with

16:21.520 --> 16:24.580
 is the ability to absorb language

16:24.580 --> 16:27.060
 and culture and beliefs, and so on.

16:27.060 --> 16:28.600
 So you're already set up for that.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.020
 So no matter what you're exposed to,

16:30.020 --> 16:32.940
 you will absorb some sort of language.

16:32.940 --> 16:34.980
 That's the trick, is how do you engineer something

16:34.980 --> 16:37.300
 just enough that it's then a sponge

16:37.300 --> 16:40.060
 that's ready to take in and fill in the blanks?

16:40.060 --> 16:42.460
 How much of the malleability is hardware?

16:42.460 --> 16:43.300
 How much is software?

16:43.300 --> 16:45.100
 Is that useful at all in the brain?

16:45.100 --> 16:46.980
 So what are we talking about?

16:46.980 --> 16:51.980
 So there's neurons, there's synapses,

16:52.100 --> 16:54.060
 and all kinds of different synapses,

16:54.060 --> 16:55.900
 and there's chemical communication,

16:55.900 --> 16:57.060
 like electrical signals,

16:57.060 --> 17:01.520
 and there's chemical communication from the synapses.

17:04.020 --> 17:09.020
 I would say the software would be the timing

17:09.020 --> 17:11.540
 and the nature of the electrical signals, I guess,

17:11.540 --> 17:14.140
 and the hardware would be the actual synapses.

17:14.140 --> 17:16.860
 So here's the thing, this is why I really, if we can,

17:16.860 --> 17:19.580
 I wanna get away from the hardware and software metaphor

17:19.580 --> 17:21.900
 because what happens is,

17:21.900 --> 17:25.100
 as activity passes through the system, it changes things.

17:25.100 --> 17:27.880
 Now, the thing that computer engineers

17:27.880 --> 17:30.300
 are really used to thinking about is synapses,

17:30.300 --> 17:31.700
 where two neurons connect.

17:31.700 --> 17:33.700
 Of course, each neuron connects with 10,000 of its neighbors,

17:33.700 --> 17:35.360
 but at a point where they connect,

17:36.860 --> 17:37.700
 what we're all used to thinking about

17:37.700 --> 17:40.820
 is the changing of the strength of that connection,

17:40.820 --> 17:42.240
 the synaptic weight.

17:42.240 --> 17:44.560
 But in fact, everything is changing.

17:44.560 --> 17:47.440
 The receptor distribution inside that neuron

17:47.440 --> 17:49.600
 so that you're more or less sensitive

17:49.600 --> 17:50.760
 to the neurotransmitter,

17:50.760 --> 17:53.440
 then the structure of the neuron itself

17:53.440 --> 17:54.440
 and what's happening there,

17:54.440 --> 17:57.360
 all the way down to biochemical cascades inside the cell,

17:57.360 --> 17:59.200
 all the way down to the nucleus,

17:59.200 --> 18:00.920
 and for example, the epigenome,

18:00.920 --> 18:05.600
 which is these little proteins that are attached to the DNA

18:05.600 --> 18:07.680
 that cause conformational changes,

18:07.680 --> 18:11.200
 that cause more genes to be expressed or repressed.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.640
 All of these things are plastic.

18:13.640 --> 18:15.960
 The reason that most people only talk

18:15.960 --> 18:17.560
 about the synaptic weights

18:17.560 --> 18:20.560
 is because that's really all we can measure well.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.600
 And all this other stuff is really, really hard to see

18:22.600 --> 18:23.600
 with our current technology.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.840
 So essentially, that just gets ignored.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.720
 But in fact, the system is plastic

18:27.720 --> 18:28.880
 at all these different levels.

18:28.880 --> 18:33.640
 And my way of thinking about this

18:33.640 --> 18:37.560
 is an analogy to pace layers.

18:37.560 --> 18:40.080
 So pace layers is a concept that Stewart Brand

18:40.080 --> 18:43.000
 suggested about how to think about cities.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.520
 So you have fashion, which changes rapidly in cities.

18:46.520 --> 18:51.520
 You have governance, which changes more slowly.

18:52.040 --> 18:54.440
 You have the structure, the buildings of a city,

18:54.440 --> 18:57.760
 which changes more slowly, all the way down to nature.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.560
 You've got all these different layers of things

18:59.560 --> 19:02.680
 that are changing at different paces, at different speeds.

19:02.680 --> 19:05.680
 I've taken that idea and mapped it onto the brain,

19:05.680 --> 19:08.480
 which is to say you have some biochemical cascades

19:08.480 --> 19:10.120
 that are just changing really rapidly

19:10.120 --> 19:11.840
 when something happens, all the way down to things

19:11.840 --> 19:14.520
 that are more and more cemented in there.

19:14.520 --> 19:19.320
 And this actually allows us to understand a lot

19:19.320 --> 19:20.920
 about particular kinds of things that happen.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.160
 For example, one of the oldest,

19:22.160 --> 19:24.680
 probably the oldest rule in neurology

19:24.680 --> 19:27.520
 is called Ribot's Law, which is that older memories

19:27.520 --> 19:29.600
 are more stable than newer memories.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.640
 So when you get old and demented,

19:32.640 --> 19:36.160
 you'll be able to remember things from your young life.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.400
 Maybe you'll remember this podcast,

19:37.400 --> 19:39.320
 but you won't remember what you did

19:39.320 --> 19:41.520
 a month ago or a year ago.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.440
 And this is a very weird structure, right?

19:43.440 --> 19:44.640
 No other system works this way,

19:44.640 --> 19:48.320
 where older memories are more stable than newer memories.

19:48.320 --> 19:52.000
 But it's because through time,

19:52.000 --> 19:53.520
 things get more and more cemented

19:53.520 --> 19:56.280
 into deeper layers of the system.

19:56.280 --> 19:59.880
 And so this is, I think, the way we have to think

19:59.880 --> 20:03.080
 about the brain, not as, okay, you've got neurons,

20:03.080 --> 20:04.880
 you've got synaptic weights, and that's it.

20:04.880 --> 20:08.640
 So, yeah, so the idea of LiveWare and LiveWired

20:08.640 --> 20:13.640
 is that it's like a, it's a gradual, yeah,

20:14.480 --> 20:18.240
 it's a gradual spectrum between software and hardware.

20:18.240 --> 20:22.000
 And so the metaphors completely doesn't make sense.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.480
 Cause like when you talk about software and hardware,

20:24.480 --> 20:26.480
 it's really hard lines.

20:26.480 --> 20:31.480
 I mean, of course, software is unlike hard,

20:31.480 --> 20:36.320
 but even hardware, but like, so there's two groups,

20:36.320 --> 20:37.640
 but in the software world,

20:37.640 --> 20:39.040
 there's levels of abstractions, right?

20:39.040 --> 20:42.120
 There's the operating system, there's machine code,

20:42.120 --> 20:44.520
 and then it gets higher and higher levels.

20:44.520 --> 20:46.920
 But somehow that's actually fundamentally different

20:46.920 --> 20:50.040
 than the layers of abstractions in the hardware.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.160
 But in the brain, it's all like the same.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.400
 And I love the city, the city metaphor.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.880
 I mean, yeah, it's kind of mind blowing

20:57.880 --> 21:01.440
 cause it's hard to know what to think about that.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.200
 Like if I were to ask the question,

21:04.160 --> 21:07.520
 this is an important question for machine learning is,

21:07.520 --> 21:09.720
 how does the brain learn?

21:09.720 --> 21:13.880
 So essentially you're saying that,

21:13.880 --> 21:17.160
 I mean, it just learns on all of these different levels

21:17.160 --> 21:19.040
 at all different paces.

21:19.040 --> 21:19.880
 Exactly right.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.360
 And as a result, what happens is

21:21.360 --> 21:24.480
 as you practice something, you get good at something,

21:24.480 --> 21:26.600
 you're physically changing the circuitry,

21:26.600 --> 21:30.000
 you're adapting your brain around the thing

21:30.000 --> 21:31.280
 that is relevant to you.

21:31.280 --> 21:34.920
 So let's say you take up, do you know how to surf?

21:34.920 --> 21:35.760
 Nope.

21:35.760 --> 21:36.600
 Okay, great.

21:36.600 --> 21:39.200
 So let's say you take up surfing now at this age.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.080
 What happens is you'll be terrible at first,

21:41.080 --> 21:42.000
 you don't know how to operate your body,

21:42.000 --> 21:43.960
 you don't know how to read the waves, things like that.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.680
 And through time you get better and better.

21:45.680 --> 21:46.960
 What you're doing is you're burning that

21:46.960 --> 21:48.600
 into the actual circuitry of your brain.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.800
 You're of course conscious when you're first doing it,

21:50.800 --> 21:52.120
 you're thinking about, okay, where am I doing?

21:52.120 --> 21:53.600
 What's my body weight?

21:53.600 --> 21:55.320
 But eventually when you become a pro at it,

21:55.320 --> 21:57.160
 you are not conscious of it at all.

21:57.160 --> 22:00.200
 In fact, you can't even unpack what it is that you did.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.920
 Think about riding a bicycle.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.080
 You can't describe how you're doing it,

22:04.080 --> 22:05.600
 you're just doing it, you're changing your balance

22:05.600 --> 22:08.040
 when you come, you know, you do this to go to a stop.

22:08.040 --> 22:10.800
 So this is what we're constantly doing

22:10.800 --> 22:14.320
 is actually shaping our own circuitry

22:14.320 --> 22:16.000
 based on what is relevant for us.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.800
 Survival, of course, being the top thing that's relevant.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.440
 But interestingly, especially with humans,

22:21.440 --> 22:23.400
 we have these particular goals in our lives,

22:23.400 --> 22:25.600
 computer science, neuroscience, whatever.

22:25.600 --> 22:28.680
 And so we actually shape our circuitry around that.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.400
 I mean, you mentioned this gets slower and slower with age,

22:31.400 --> 22:36.080
 but is there, like I think I've read and spoken offline,

22:36.080 --> 22:41.080
 even on this podcast with a developmental neurobiologist,

22:41.320 --> 22:43.400
 I guess would be the right terminology,

22:43.400 --> 22:45.520
 is like looking at the very early,

22:45.520 --> 22:50.440
 like from embryonic stem cells to the creation of the brain.

22:50.440 --> 22:55.320
 And like, that's mind blowing how much stuff happens there.

22:55.320 --> 22:57.440
 So it's very malleable at that stage.

22:59.280 --> 23:01.560
 And then, but after that,

23:01.560 --> 23:04.600
 at which point does it stop being malleable?

23:04.600 --> 23:06.040
 So that's the interesting thing

23:06.040 --> 23:08.480
 is that it remains malleable your whole life.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.200
 So even when you're an old person,

23:10.200 --> 23:13.120
 you'll be able to remember new faces and names,

23:13.120 --> 23:15.680
 you'll be able to learn new sorts of tasks.

23:15.680 --> 23:16.520
 And thank goodness,

23:16.520 --> 23:17.960
 cause the world is changing rapidly

23:17.960 --> 23:19.720
 in terms of technology and so on.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.400
 I just sent my mother an Alexa

23:21.400 --> 23:23.400
 and she figured out how to go on the settings

23:23.400 --> 23:24.240
 and do the thing.

23:24.240 --> 23:26.960
 And I was really impressed that she was able to do it.

23:26.960 --> 23:28.520
 So there are parts of the brain

23:28.520 --> 23:30.360
 that remain malleable their whole life.

23:30.360 --> 23:34.200
 The interesting part is that really your goal

23:34.200 --> 23:36.080
 is to make an internal model of the world.

23:36.080 --> 23:39.120
 Your goal is to say, okay,

23:39.120 --> 23:42.280
 the brain is trapped in silence and darkness,

23:42.280 --> 23:43.520
 and it's trying to understand

23:43.520 --> 23:46.040
 how the world works out there, right?

23:46.040 --> 23:47.080
 I love that image.

23:47.080 --> 23:48.240
 Yeah, I guess it is.

23:48.240 --> 23:49.080
 Yeah.

23:49.080 --> 23:53.040
 You forget, it's like this lonely thing

23:53.040 --> 23:54.640
 is sitting in its own container

23:54.640 --> 23:57.080
 and trying to actually throw a few sensors,

23:57.080 --> 23:58.760
 figure out what the hell's going on.

23:58.760 --> 23:59.800
 You know what I sometimes think about

23:59.800 --> 24:03.120
 is that movie, The Martian with Matt Damon,

24:03.120 --> 24:05.560
 the, I mean, it was written in a book, of course,

24:05.560 --> 24:08.400
 but the movie poster shows Matt Damon

24:08.400 --> 24:09.800
 all alone on the red planet.

24:09.800 --> 24:12.520
 And I think, God, that's actually what it's like

24:12.520 --> 24:16.360
 to be inside your head and my head and anybody's head

24:16.360 --> 24:20.200
 is that you're essentially on your own planet in there.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.600
 And I'm essentially on my own planet.

24:21.600 --> 24:24.080
 And everyone's got their own world

24:24.080 --> 24:26.680
 where you've absorbed all of your experiences

24:26.680 --> 24:28.000
 up to this moment in your life

24:28.000 --> 24:29.560
 that have made you exactly who you are

24:29.560 --> 24:31.120
 and same for me and everyone.

24:31.120 --> 24:36.120
 And we've got this very thin bandwidth of communication.

24:36.680 --> 24:38.720
 And I'll say something like,

24:38.720 --> 24:40.720
 oh yeah, that tastes just like peaches.

24:40.720 --> 24:42.840
 And you'll say, oh, I know what you mean.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.280
 But the experience, of course,

24:44.280 --> 24:46.560
 might be vastly different for us.

24:47.680 --> 24:48.520
 But anyway, yes.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.520
 So the brain is trapped in silence and darkness,

24:50.520 --> 24:53.280
 each one of us, and what it's trying to do,

24:53.280 --> 24:54.120
 this is the important part,

24:54.120 --> 24:55.720
 it's trying to make an internal model

24:55.720 --> 24:56.560
 of what's going on out there,

24:56.560 --> 24:58.800
 as in how do I function in the world?

24:58.800 --> 25:00.800
 How do I interact with other people?

25:00.800 --> 25:02.680
 Do I say something nice and polite?

25:02.680 --> 25:04.040
 Do I say something aggressive and mean?

25:04.040 --> 25:05.560
 Do I, you know, all these things

25:05.560 --> 25:08.440
 that it's putting together about the world.

25:08.440 --> 25:12.320
 And I think what happens when people get older and older,

25:12.320 --> 25:15.480
 it may not be that plasticity is diminishing.

25:15.480 --> 25:18.160
 It may be that their internal model essentially

25:18.160 --> 25:20.120
 has set itself up in a way where it says,

25:20.120 --> 25:21.160
 okay, I've pretty much got

25:21.160 --> 25:22.800
 a really good understanding of the world now,

25:22.800 --> 25:25.400
 and I don't really need to change, right?

25:25.400 --> 25:28.600
 So when much older people find themselves

25:28.600 --> 25:30.800
 in a situation where they need to change,

25:30.800 --> 25:33.280
 they can actually are able to do it.

25:33.280 --> 25:34.760
 It's just that I think this notion

25:34.760 --> 25:36.960
 that we all have that plasticity diminishes

25:36.960 --> 25:38.880
 as we grow older is in part

25:38.880 --> 25:41.480
 because the motivation isn't there.

25:41.480 --> 25:44.120
 But if you were 80 and you get fired from your job

25:44.120 --> 25:45.720
 and suddenly had to figure out

25:45.720 --> 25:47.440
 how to program a WordPress site or something,

25:47.440 --> 25:48.920
 you'd figure it out.

25:48.920 --> 25:49.760
 Got it.

25:49.760 --> 25:53.720
 So the capability, the possibility of change is there.

25:53.720 --> 25:57.040
 But then that's the highest challenge,

25:57.040 --> 26:00.880
 the interesting challenge to this plasticity,

26:00.880 --> 26:03.440
 to this liveware system.

26:03.440 --> 26:06.000
 If we could talk about brain computer interfaces

26:06.000 --> 26:09.040
 and Neuralink, what are your thoughts

26:09.040 --> 26:13.680
 about the efforts of Elon Musk, Neuralink, BCI in general

26:13.680 --> 26:18.320
 in this regard, which is adding a machine,

26:18.320 --> 26:21.720
 a computer, the capability of a computer

26:21.720 --> 26:22.800
 to communicate with the brain

26:22.800 --> 26:24.920
 and the brain to communicate with a computer

26:24.920 --> 26:26.800
 at the very basic applications

26:26.800 --> 26:28.880
 and then like the futuristic kind of thoughts.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.920
 Yeah, first of all, it's terrific

26:30.920 --> 26:32.360
 that people are jumping in and doing that

26:32.360 --> 26:34.480
 because it's clearly the future.

26:34.480 --> 26:37.280
 The interesting part is our brains have pretty good methods

26:37.280 --> 26:38.760
 of interacting with technology.

26:38.760 --> 26:41.520
 So maybe it's your fat thumbs on a cell phone or something,

26:41.520 --> 26:44.600
 but, or maybe it's watching a YouTube video

26:44.600 --> 26:45.840
 and getting into your eye that way.

26:45.840 --> 26:48.360
 But we have pretty rapid ways of communicating

26:48.360 --> 26:49.960
 with technology and getting data.

26:49.960 --> 26:52.760
 So if you actually crack open the skull

26:52.760 --> 26:55.600
 and go into the inner sanctum of the brain,

26:56.520 --> 26:58.200
 you might be able to get a little bit faster,

26:58.200 --> 27:03.200
 but I'll tell you, I'm not so sanguine

27:03.400 --> 27:06.640
 on the future of that as a business.

27:06.640 --> 27:07.480
 And I'll tell you why.

27:07.480 --> 27:10.040
 It's because there are various ways

27:10.040 --> 27:11.160
 of getting data in and out

27:11.160 --> 27:14.480
 and an open head surgery is a big deal.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.560
 Neurosurgeons don't wanna do it

27:16.560 --> 27:18.000
 because there's always risk of death

27:18.000 --> 27:19.640
 and infection on the table.

27:19.640 --> 27:23.200
 And also it's not clear how many people would say,

27:23.200 --> 27:26.000
 I'm gonna volunteer to get something in my head

27:26.000 --> 27:29.800
 so that I can text faster, 20% faster.

27:29.800 --> 27:33.720
 So I think it's, mother nature surrounds the brain

27:33.720 --> 27:37.840
 with this armored bunker of the skull

27:37.840 --> 27:39.680
 because it's a very delicate material.

27:39.680 --> 27:41.680
 And there's an expression in neurosurgery

27:44.200 --> 27:46.480
 about the brain is,

27:46.480 --> 27:49.080
 the person is never the same after you open up their skull.

27:49.080 --> 27:51.640
 Now, whether or not that's true or whatever, who cares?

27:51.640 --> 27:54.080
 But it's a big deal to do an open head surgery.

27:54.080 --> 27:57.520
 So what I'm interested in is how can we get information

27:57.520 --> 27:58.360
 in and out of the brain

27:58.360 --> 28:00.680
 without having to crack the skull open?

28:00.680 --> 28:03.880
 Without messing with the biological part,

28:03.880 --> 28:06.480
 directly connecting or messing

28:06.480 --> 28:10.440
 with the intricate biological thing that we got going on

28:10.440 --> 28:11.920
 and it seems to be working.

28:11.920 --> 28:12.760
 Yeah, exactly.

28:12.760 --> 28:15.400
 And by the way, where Neuralink is going,

28:15.400 --> 28:18.240
 which is wonderful, is going to be in patient cases.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.520
 It really matters for all kinds of surgeries

28:20.520 --> 28:21.760
 that a person needs,

28:21.760 --> 28:24.000
 whether for Parkinson's or epilepsy or whatever.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.680
 It's a terrific new technology

28:25.680 --> 28:27.760
 for essentially sewing electrodes in there

28:27.760 --> 28:30.000
 and getting more higher density of electrodes.

28:30.000 --> 28:30.960
 So that's great.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.400
 I just don't think as far as the future of BCI goes,

28:34.400 --> 28:38.400
 I don't suspect that people will go in and say,

28:38.400 --> 28:40.640
 yeah, drill a hole in my head and do this.

28:40.640 --> 28:41.680
 Well, it's interesting

28:41.680 --> 28:44.280
 because I think there's a similar intuition

28:44.280 --> 28:46.680
 but say in the world of autonomous vehicles

28:46.680 --> 28:49.400
 that folks know how hard it is

28:49.400 --> 28:51.560
 and it seems damn impossible.

28:51.560 --> 28:52.960
 The similar intuition about,

28:52.960 --> 28:54.680
 I'm sticking on the Elon Musk thing

28:54.680 --> 28:57.040
 is just a good, easy example.

28:57.040 --> 28:59.680
 Similar intuition about colonizing Mars,

28:59.680 --> 29:01.440
 it like, if you really think about it,

29:01.440 --> 29:04.760
 it seems extremely difficult.

29:04.760 --> 29:08.960
 And almost, I mean, just technically difficult

29:08.960 --> 29:12.000
 to a degree where you wanna ask,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.840
 is it really worth doing, worth trying?

29:14.840 --> 29:17.880
 And then the same is applied with BCI.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.400
 But the thing about the future

29:21.800 --> 29:23.720
 is it's hard to predict.

29:23.720 --> 29:26.680
 So the exciting thing to me with,

29:26.680 --> 29:29.640
 so once it does, once if successful,

29:29.640 --> 29:31.640
 it's able to help patients,

29:31.640 --> 29:36.640
 it may be able to discover something very surprising

29:36.680 --> 29:39.560
 of our ability to directly communicate with the brain.

29:39.560 --> 29:42.840
 So exactly what you're interested in is figuring out

29:42.840 --> 29:46.640
 how to play with this malleable brain,

29:46.640 --> 29:49.480
 but like help assist it somehow.

29:49.480 --> 29:52.240
 I mean, it's such a compelling notion to me

29:52.240 --> 29:53.640
 that we're now working on

29:53.640 --> 29:55.960
 all these exciting machine learning systems

29:55.960 --> 29:59.760
 that are able to learn from data.

29:59.760 --> 30:04.040
 And then if we can have this other brain

30:04.040 --> 30:05.600
 that's a learning system,

30:05.600 --> 30:09.600
 that's live wired on the human side

30:09.600 --> 30:11.520
 and them to be able to communicate,

30:11.520 --> 30:14.120
 it's like a self play mechanism

30:14.120 --> 30:17.800
 was able to beat the world champion at Go.

30:17.800 --> 30:19.560
 So they can play with each other,

30:19.560 --> 30:22.440
 the computer and the brain, like when you sleep.

30:22.440 --> 30:24.520
 I mean, there's a lot of futuristic kind of things

30:24.520 --> 30:27.640
 that it's just exciting possibilities,

30:27.640 --> 30:30.240
 but I hear you, we understand so little

30:30.240 --> 30:34.080
 about the actual intricacies of the communication

30:34.080 --> 30:38.480
 of the brain that it's hard to find the common language.

30:38.480 --> 30:43.480
 Well, interestingly, the technologies that have been built

30:45.800 --> 30:48.320
 don't actually require the perfect common language.

30:48.320 --> 30:51.080
 So for example, hundreds of thousands of people

30:51.080 --> 30:52.440
 are walking around with artificial ears

30:52.440 --> 30:53.440
 and artificial eyes,

30:53.440 --> 30:56.920
 meaning cochlear implants or retinal implants.

30:56.920 --> 31:00.320
 So this is, you take a essentially digital microphone,

31:00.320 --> 31:03.240
 you slip an electrode strip into the inner ear

31:03.240 --> 31:05.160
 and people can learn how to hear that way,

31:05.160 --> 31:06.600
 or you take an electrode grid

31:06.600 --> 31:09.240
 and you plug it into the retina at the back of the eye

31:09.240 --> 31:11.160
 and people can learn how to see that way.

31:11.160 --> 31:13.880
 The interesting part is those devices

31:13.880 --> 31:17.120
 don't speak exactly the natural biological language,

31:17.120 --> 31:19.400
 they speak the dialect of Silicon Valley.

31:19.400 --> 31:24.360
 And it turns out that as recently as about 25 years ago,

31:24.360 --> 31:26.520
 a lot of people thought this was never gonna work.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.960
 They thought it wasn't gonna work for that reason,

31:28.960 --> 31:30.360
 but the brain figures it out.

31:30.360 --> 31:32.200
 It's really good at saying, okay, look,

31:32.200 --> 31:34.200
 there's some correlation between what I can touch

31:34.200 --> 31:35.840
 and feel and hear and so on,

31:35.840 --> 31:37.040
 and the data that's coming in,

31:37.040 --> 31:41.520
 or between I clap my hands and I have signals coming in there

31:41.520 --> 31:44.240
 and it figures out how to speak any language.

31:44.240 --> 31:45.080
 Oh, that's fascinating.

31:45.080 --> 31:50.000
 So like no matter if it's Neuralink,

31:50.000 --> 31:51.760
 so directly communicating with the brain,

31:51.760 --> 31:54.720
 or it's a smartphone or Google Glass,

31:54.720 --> 31:58.800
 or the brain figures out the efficient way of communication.

31:58.800 --> 32:00.200
 Well, exactly, exactly.

32:00.200 --> 32:03.680
 And what I propose is the potato head theory of evolution,

32:03.680 --> 32:08.320
 which is that all our eyes and nose and mouth and ears

32:08.320 --> 32:10.760
 and fingertips, all this stuff is just plug and play.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.760
 And the brain can figure out

32:12.760 --> 32:14.160
 what to do with the data that comes in.

32:14.160 --> 32:17.600
 And part of the reason that I think this is right,

32:17.600 --> 32:18.960
 and I care so deeply about this,

32:18.960 --> 32:20.360
 is when you look across the animal kingdom,

32:20.360 --> 32:23.520
 you find all kinds of weird peripheral devices plugged in,

32:23.520 --> 32:25.760
 and the brain figures out what to do with the data.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.360
 And I don't believe that Mother Nature

32:27.360 --> 32:32.360
 has to reinvent the principles of brain operation each time

32:32.360 --> 32:33.800
 to say, oh, now I'm gonna have heat pits

32:33.800 --> 32:34.640
 to detect infrared.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.280
 Now I'm gonna have something

32:36.280 --> 32:39.200
 to detect electroreceptors on the body.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.040
 Now I'm gonna detect something

32:40.040 --> 32:42.520
 to pick up the magnetic field of the earth

32:42.520 --> 32:43.960
 with cryptochromes in the eye.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.800
 And so instead the brain says, oh, I got it.

32:45.800 --> 32:47.240
 There's data coming in.

32:47.240 --> 32:48.080
 Is that useful?

32:48.080 --> 32:48.920
 Can I do something with it?

32:48.920 --> 32:50.440
 Oh, great, I'm gonna mold myself

32:50.440 --> 32:52.640
 around the data that's coming in.

32:52.640 --> 32:55.440
 It's kind of fascinating to think that,

32:55.440 --> 32:56.560
 we think of smartphones

32:56.560 --> 32:58.760
 and all this new technology as novel.

32:58.760 --> 33:02.680
 It's totally novel as outside of what evolution

33:02.680 --> 33:05.600
 ever intended or like what nature ever intended.

33:05.600 --> 33:08.400
 It's fascinating to think that like the entirety

33:08.400 --> 33:10.960
 of the process of evolution is perfectly fine

33:10.960 --> 33:14.200
 and ready for the smartphone and the internet.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.240
 Like it's ready.

33:15.240 --> 33:17.120
 It's ready to be valuable to that.

33:17.120 --> 33:21.440
 And whatever comes to cyborgs, to virtual reality,

33:21.440 --> 33:23.480
 we kind of think like, this is, you know,

33:23.480 --> 33:27.000
 there's all these like books written about what's natural

33:27.000 --> 33:29.600
 and we're like destroying our natural cells

33:29.600 --> 33:32.560
 by like embracing all this technology.

33:32.560 --> 33:34.520
 It's kind of, you know,

33:34.520 --> 33:36.480
 probably not giving the brain enough credit.

33:36.480 --> 33:40.240
 Like this thing is just fine with new tech.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.840
 Oh, exactly, it wraps itself around.

33:41.840 --> 33:43.120
 And by the way, wait till you have kids.

33:43.120 --> 33:46.320
 You'll see the ease with which they pick up on stuff.

33:46.320 --> 33:50.280
 And as Kevin Kelly said,

33:50.280 --> 33:54.480
 technology is what gets invented after you're born.

33:54.480 --> 33:56.280
 But the stuff that already exists when you're born,

33:56.280 --> 33:58.120
 that's not even tech, that's just background furniture.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.840
 Like the fact that the iPad exists for my son and daughter,

34:00.840 --> 34:02.320
 like that's just background furniture.

34:02.320 --> 34:06.240
 So, yeah, it's because we have

34:06.240 --> 34:08.200
 this incredibly malleable system,

34:08.200 --> 34:10.680
 that just absorbs whatever is going on in the world

34:10.680 --> 34:11.840
 and learns what to do with it.

34:11.840 --> 34:15.400
 So do you think, just to linger for a little bit more,

34:15.400 --> 34:20.400
 do you think it's possible to co adjust?

34:22.160 --> 34:25.400
 Like we're kind of, you know,

34:25.400 --> 34:27.880
 for the machine to adjust to the brain,

34:27.880 --> 34:29.240
 for the brain to adjust to the machine.

34:29.240 --> 34:31.040
 I guess that's what's already happening.

34:31.040 --> 34:32.360
 Sure, that is what's happening.

34:32.360 --> 34:34.640
 So for example, when you put electrodes

34:34.640 --> 34:37.200
 in the motor cortex to control a robotic arm

34:37.200 --> 34:39.240
 for somebody who's paralyzed,

34:39.240 --> 34:41.080
 the engineers do a lot of work to figure out,

34:41.080 --> 34:42.840
 okay, what can we do with the algorithm here

34:42.840 --> 34:45.640
 so that we can detect what's going on from these cells

34:45.640 --> 34:49.760
 and figure out how to best program the robotic arm to move

34:49.760 --> 34:51.920
 given the data that we're measuring from these cells.

34:51.920 --> 34:54.560
 But also the brain is learning too.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.040
 So, you know, the paralyzed woman says,

34:57.040 --> 34:58.840
 wait, I'm trying to grab this thing.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.880
 And by the way, it's all about relevance.

35:00.880 --> 35:04.040
 So if there's a piece of food there and she's hungry,

35:04.040 --> 35:08.240
 she'll figure out how to get this food into her mouth

35:08.240 --> 35:11.320
 with the robotic arm because that is what matters.

35:13.240 --> 35:15.520
 Well, that's, okay, first of all,

35:15.520 --> 35:17.640
 that paints a really promising and beautiful,

35:17.640 --> 35:20.160
 for some reason, really optimistic picture

35:20.160 --> 35:25.160
 that, you know, our brain is able to adjust to so much.

35:26.320 --> 35:29.640
 You know, so many things happened this year, 2020,

35:29.640 --> 35:32.960
 that you think like, how are we ever going to deal with it?

35:32.960 --> 35:35.680
 And it's somehow encouraging

35:35.680 --> 35:40.680
 and inspiring that like we're going to be okay.

35:41.120 --> 35:41.960
 Well, that's right.

35:41.960 --> 35:45.080
 I actually think, so 2020 has been an awful year

35:45.080 --> 35:46.960
 for almost everybody in many ways,

35:46.960 --> 35:50.440
 but the one silver lining has to do with brain plasticity,

35:50.440 --> 35:54.080
 which is to say we've all been on our, you know,

35:54.080 --> 35:56.480
 on our gerbil wheels, we've all been in our routines.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.600
 And, you know, as I mentioned,

35:58.600 --> 36:00.760
 our internal models are all about

36:00.760 --> 36:02.320
 how do you maximally succeed?

36:02.320 --> 36:04.560
 How do you optimize your operation

36:04.560 --> 36:07.240
 in this circumstance where you are, right?

36:07.240 --> 36:09.080
 And then all of a sudden, bang, 2020 comes,

36:09.080 --> 36:10.920
 we're completely off our wheels.

36:10.920 --> 36:14.880
 We're having to create new things all the time

36:14.880 --> 36:15.960
 and figure out how to do it.

36:15.960 --> 36:18.720
 And that is terrific for brain plasticity because,

36:18.720 --> 36:23.480
 and we know this because there are very large studies

36:23.480 --> 36:26.480
 on older people who stay cognitively active

36:26.480 --> 36:28.000
 their whole lives.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.760
 Some fraction of them have Alzheimer's disease

36:31.760 --> 36:34.640
 physically, but nobody knows that when they're alive.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.000
 Even though their brain is getting chewed up

36:36.000 --> 36:38.600
 with the ravages of Alzheimer's,

36:38.600 --> 36:40.000
 cognitively they're doing just fine.

36:40.000 --> 36:40.840
 Why?

36:40.840 --> 36:44.080
 It's because they're challenged all the time.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.520
 They've got all these new things going on,

36:45.520 --> 36:47.200
 all this novelty, all these responsibilities,

36:47.200 --> 36:49.640
 chores, social life, all these things happening.

36:49.640 --> 36:52.760
 And as a result, they're constantly building new roadways,

36:52.760 --> 36:54.680
 even as parts degrade.

36:54.680 --> 36:57.720
 And that's the only good news is that

36:57.720 --> 36:59.480
 we are in a situation where suddenly

36:59.480 --> 37:02.000
 we can't just operate like automata anymore.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.520
 We have to think of completely new ways to do things.

37:05.520 --> 37:06.720
 And that's wonderful.

37:07.880 --> 37:11.200
 I don't know why this question popped into my head.

37:11.200 --> 37:16.080
 It's quite absurd, but are we gonna be okay?

37:16.080 --> 37:17.200
 Yeah.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.640
 You said this is the promising silver lining

37:19.640 --> 37:20.480
 just from your own,

37:20.480 --> 37:22.840
 cause you've written about this and thought about this

37:22.840 --> 37:25.240
 outside of maybe even the plasticity of the brain,

37:25.240 --> 37:29.920
 but just this whole pandemic kind of changed the way

37:29.920 --> 37:34.920
 it knocked us out of this hamster wheel like that of habit.

37:35.560 --> 37:39.400
 A lot of people had to reinvent themselves.

37:39.400 --> 37:42.240
 Unfortunately, and I have a lot of friends

37:42.240 --> 37:47.240
 who either already or are going to lose their business,

37:48.160 --> 37:52.720
 is basically it's taking the dreams that people have had

37:52.720 --> 37:57.720
 and said this dream, this particular dream you've had

37:58.160 --> 38:00.080
 will no longer be possible.

38:00.080 --> 38:02.040
 So you have to find something new.

38:02.040 --> 38:06.000
 What are your, are we gonna be okay?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.080
 Yeah, we'll be okay in the sense that,

38:08.080 --> 38:09.560
 I mean, it's gonna be a rough time

38:09.560 --> 38:11.800
 for many or most people,

38:11.800 --> 38:16.120
 but in the sense that it is sometimes useful

38:18.000 --> 38:20.760
 to find that what you thought was your dream

38:20.760 --> 38:24.520
 was not the thing that you're going to do.

38:24.520 --> 38:26.760
 This is obviously the plot in lots of Hollywood movies

38:26.760 --> 38:27.920
 that someone says, I'm gonna do this,

38:27.920 --> 38:29.280
 and then that gets foiled

38:29.280 --> 38:31.080
 and they end up doing something better.

38:31.080 --> 38:32.320
 But this is true in life.

38:32.320 --> 38:37.320
 I mean, in general, even though we plan our lives

38:38.440 --> 38:42.080
 as best we can, it's predicated on our notion of,

38:42.080 --> 38:43.600
 okay, given everything that's around me,

38:43.600 --> 38:45.800
 this is what's possible for me next.

38:47.040 --> 38:49.400
 But it takes 2020 to knock you off that

38:49.400 --> 38:50.840
 where you think, oh, well, actually,

38:50.840 --> 38:52.680
 maybe there's something I can be doing

38:52.680 --> 38:54.320
 that's bigger, that's better.

38:54.320 --> 38:56.560
 Yeah, you know, for me, one exciting thing,

38:56.560 --> 38:59.600
 and I just talked to Grant Sanderson.

38:59.600 --> 39:00.680
 I don't know if you know who he is.

39:00.680 --> 39:03.600
 He's a 3Blue1Brown, it's a YouTube channel.

39:03.600 --> 39:08.200
 He does, he's a, if you see it, you would recognize it.

39:08.200 --> 39:11.120
 He's like a really famous math guy,

39:11.120 --> 39:12.400
 and he's a math educator,

39:12.400 --> 39:15.040
 and he does these incredible, beautiful videos.

39:15.040 --> 39:17.000
 And now I see sort of at MIT,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.680
 folks are struggling to try to figure out,

39:19.680 --> 39:21.800
 you know, if we do teach remotely,

39:21.800 --> 39:23.560
 how do we do it effectively?

39:23.560 --> 39:27.960
 So you have these world class researchers

39:27.960 --> 39:30.240
 and professors trying to figure out

39:30.240 --> 39:33.760
 how to put content online that teaches people.

39:33.760 --> 39:37.720
 And to me, a possible future of that is,

39:37.720 --> 39:42.720
 you know, Nobel Prize winning faculty become YouTubers.

39:42.720 --> 39:47.720
 Like that to me is so exciting, like what Grant said,

39:47.720 --> 39:52.480
 which is like the possibility of creating canonical videos

39:52.480 --> 39:55.000
 on the thing you're a world expert in.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.880
 You know, there's so many topics.

39:56.880 --> 40:00.880
 It just, the world doesn't, you know, there's faculty.

40:00.880 --> 40:02.120
 I mentioned Russ Tedrick.

40:02.120 --> 40:04.240
 There's all these people in robotics

40:04.240 --> 40:07.880
 that are experts in a particular beautiful field

40:07.880 --> 40:09.840
 on which there's only just papers.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.680
 There's no popular book.

40:12.680 --> 40:16.400
 There's no clean canonical video

40:16.400 --> 40:18.120
 showing the beauty of a subject.

40:18.120 --> 40:22.360
 And one possibility is they try to create that

40:22.360 --> 40:25.400
 and share it with the world.

40:25.400 --> 40:26.400
 This is the beautiful thing.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.880
 This of course has been happening for a while already.

40:28.880 --> 40:31.720
 I mean, for example, when I go and I give book talks,

40:31.720 --> 40:33.760
 often what'll happen is some 13 year old

40:33.760 --> 40:35.360
 will come up to me afterwards and say something,

40:35.360 --> 40:37.160
 and I'll say, my God, that was so smart.

40:37.160 --> 40:38.840
 Like, how did you know that?

40:38.840 --> 40:40.320
 And they'll say, oh, I saw it on a Ted talk.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.880
 Well, what an amazing opportunity.

40:42.880 --> 40:46.440
 Here you got the best person in the world on subject X

40:46.440 --> 40:51.440
 giving a 15 minute talk as beautifully as he or she can.

40:51.880 --> 40:53.440
 And the 13 year old just grows up with that.

40:53.440 --> 40:55.160
 That's just the mother's milk, right?

40:55.160 --> 40:57.720
 As opposed to when we grew up,

40:57.720 --> 41:00.320
 you know, I had whatever homeroom teacher I had

41:00.320 --> 41:03.200
 and, you know, whatever classmates I had.

41:03.200 --> 41:06.440
 And hopefully that person knew what he or she was teaching

41:06.440 --> 41:08.760
 and often didn't and, you know, just made things up.

41:08.760 --> 41:12.960
 So the opportunity that has become extraordinary

41:12.960 --> 41:14.480
 to get the best of the world.

41:14.480 --> 41:15.720
 And the reason this matters, of course,

41:15.720 --> 41:18.560
 is because obviously, back to plasticity,

41:18.560 --> 41:22.000
 the way that we, the way our brain gets molded

41:22.000 --> 41:24.320
 is by absorbing everything from the world,

41:24.320 --> 41:28.520
 all of the knowledge and the data and so on that it can get,

41:28.520 --> 41:33.040
 and then springboarding off of that.

41:33.040 --> 41:34.340
 And we're in a very lucky time now

41:34.340 --> 41:39.340
 because we grew up with a lot of just in case learning.

41:40.340 --> 41:42.000
 So, you know, just in case you ever need to know

41:42.000 --> 41:44.720
 these dates in Mongolian history, here they are.

41:44.720 --> 41:47.280
 But what kids are grown up with now, like my kids,

41:47.280 --> 41:48.800
 is tons of just in time learning.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.120
 So as soon as they're curious about something,

41:50.120 --> 41:51.800
 they ask Alexa, they ask Google Home,

41:51.800 --> 41:53.080
 they get the answer right there

41:53.080 --> 41:54.600
 in the context of their curiosity.

41:54.600 --> 41:59.600
 The reason this matters is because for plasticity to happen,

41:59.720 --> 42:02.480
 you need to care, you need to be curious about something.

42:02.480 --> 42:03.760
 And this is something, by the way,

42:03.760 --> 42:06.320
 that the ancient Romans had noted.

42:06.320 --> 42:08.360
 They had outlined seven different levels of learning

42:08.360 --> 42:10.600
 and the highest level is when you're curious about a topic.

42:10.600 --> 42:13.200
 But anyway, so kids now are getting tons

42:13.200 --> 42:15.800
 of just in time learning, and as a result,

42:15.800 --> 42:18.440
 they're gonna be so much smarter than we are.

42:18.440 --> 42:19.760
 They're just, and we can already see that.

42:19.760 --> 42:22.200
 I mean, my boy is eight years old, my girl is five.

42:22.200 --> 42:25.740
 But I mean, the things that he knows are amazing

42:25.740 --> 42:27.800
 because it's not just him having to do

42:27.800 --> 42:29.960
 the rote memorization stuff that we did.

42:29.960 --> 42:32.280
 Yeah, it's just fascinating what the brain,

42:32.280 --> 42:33.640
 what young brains look like now

42:33.640 --> 42:36.880
 because of all those TED Talks just loaded in there.

42:36.880 --> 42:39.920
 And there's also, I mean, a lot of people, right,

42:39.920 --> 42:42.960
 kind of, there's a sense that our attention span

42:42.960 --> 42:46.320
 is growing shorter, but it's complicated

42:46.320 --> 42:50.760
 because for example, most people, majority of people,

42:50.760 --> 42:53.000
 it's the 80 plus percent of people listen

42:53.000 --> 42:54.600
 to the entirety of these things,

42:54.600 --> 42:56.800
 two, three hours for the podcast,

42:56.800 --> 43:00.920
 long form podcasts are becoming more and more popular.

43:00.920 --> 43:04.240
 So like that's, it's all really giant complicated mess.

43:04.240 --> 43:07.440
 And the point is that the brain is able to adjust to it

43:07.440 --> 43:11.840
 and somehow like form a worldview

43:11.840 --> 43:16.840
 within this new medium of like information that we have.

43:17.040 --> 43:19.920
 You have like these short tweets

43:19.920 --> 43:22.840
 and you have these three, four hour podcasts

43:22.840 --> 43:24.940
 and you have Netflix movie.

43:24.940 --> 43:27.200
 I mean, it's just, it's adjusting to the entirety

43:27.200 --> 43:30.080
 and just absorbing it and taking it all in

43:30.080 --> 43:34.600
 and then pops up COVID that forces us all to be home

43:34.600 --> 43:39.200
 and it all just adjusts and figures it out.

43:39.200 --> 43:40.200
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.880
 It's fascinating.

43:41.880 --> 43:43.880
 Been talking about the brain

43:43.880 --> 43:48.400
 as if it's something separate from the human

43:48.400 --> 43:50.280
 that carries it a little bit.

43:50.280 --> 43:52.180
 Like whenever you talk about the brain,

43:52.180 --> 43:55.340
 it's easy to forget that that's like, that's us.

43:55.340 --> 43:58.700
 Like how much do you,

43:59.620 --> 44:03.420
 how much is the whole thing like predetermined?

44:04.860 --> 44:07.720
 Like how much is it already encoded in there?

44:08.580 --> 44:12.380
 And how much is it the, what's the hit?

44:17.020 --> 44:22.020
 The actions, the decisions, the judgments, the...

44:22.220 --> 44:23.300
 You mean like who you are?

44:23.300 --> 44:24.140
 Who you are.

44:24.140 --> 44:25.760
 Oh, yeah, yeah, okay, great question.

44:25.760 --> 44:27.400
 Right, so there used to be a big debate

44:27.400 --> 44:28.900
 about nature versus nurture.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.380
 And we now know that it's always both.

44:31.380 --> 44:32.720
 You can't even separate them

44:32.720 --> 44:35.500
 because you come to the table with a certain amount of nature

44:35.500 --> 44:37.740
 for example, your whole genome and so on.

44:37.740 --> 44:39.680
 The experiences you have in the womb,

44:39.680 --> 44:41.820
 like whether your mother is smoking or drinking,

44:41.820 --> 44:43.740
 things like that, whether she's stressed, so on.

44:43.740 --> 44:47.260
 Those all influence how you're gonna pop out of the womb.

44:47.260 --> 44:50.180
 From there, everything is an interaction

44:50.180 --> 44:55.180
 between all of your experiences and the nature.

44:55.500 --> 44:59.900
 What I mean is, I think of it like a space time cone

44:59.900 --> 45:01.820
 where you have, you drop into the world

45:01.820 --> 45:03.160
 and depending on the experience that you have,

45:03.160 --> 45:04.220
 you might go off in this direction

45:04.220 --> 45:05.980
 or that direction or in that direction

45:05.980 --> 45:08.460
 because there's interaction on the way.

45:08.460 --> 45:11.080
 Your experiences determine what happens

45:11.080 --> 45:12.380
 with the expression of your genes.

45:12.380 --> 45:15.980
 So some genes get repressed, some get expressed and so on.

45:15.980 --> 45:17.620
 And you actually become a different person

45:17.620 --> 45:18.940
 based on your experiences.

45:18.940 --> 45:21.140
 There's a whole field called epigenomics,

45:21.140 --> 45:24.020
 which is, or epigenetics I should say,

45:24.020 --> 45:26.400
 which is about the epigenome.

45:26.400 --> 45:30.380
 And that is the layer that sits on top of the DNA

45:30.380 --> 45:32.560
 and causes the genes to express differently.

45:32.560 --> 45:35.140
 That is directly related to the experiences that you have.

45:35.140 --> 45:38.700
 So if, just as an example, they take rat pups

45:38.700 --> 45:41.560
 and one group is placed away from their parents

45:41.560 --> 45:43.580
 and the other group is groomed and licked

45:43.580 --> 45:44.620
 and taken good care of,

45:44.620 --> 45:46.100
 that changes their gene expression

45:46.100 --> 45:46.940
 for the rest of their life.

45:46.940 --> 45:48.140
 They go off in different directions

45:48.140 --> 45:49.580
 in this space time cone.

45:50.940 --> 45:55.820
 So yeah, this is of course why it matters

45:55.820 --> 45:58.380
 that we take care of children and pour money

45:58.380 --> 46:00.780
 into things like education and good childcare

46:00.780 --> 46:03.480
 and so on for children broadly,

46:04.460 --> 46:08.340
 because these formative years matter so much.

46:08.340 --> 46:10.160
 So is there a free will?

46:11.620 --> 46:13.940
 This is a great question.

46:13.940 --> 46:16.500
 I apologize for the absurd high level

46:16.500 --> 46:17.340
 philosophical questions.

46:17.340 --> 46:19.060
 No, no, these are my favorite kind of questions.

46:19.060 --> 46:20.900
 Here's the thing, here's the thing.

46:20.900 --> 46:21.780
 We don't know.

46:21.780 --> 46:23.300
 If you ask most neuroscientists,

46:23.300 --> 46:26.780
 they'll say that we can't really think

46:26.780 --> 46:28.660
 of how you would get free will in there

46:28.660 --> 46:30.280
 because as far as we can tell, it's a machine.

46:30.280 --> 46:32.200
 It's a very complicated machine.

46:33.420 --> 46:36.140
 Enormously sophisticated, 86 billion neurons,

46:36.140 --> 46:38.140
 about the same number of glial cells.

46:38.140 --> 46:40.140
 Each of these things is as complicated

46:40.140 --> 46:41.280
 as the city of San Francisco.

46:41.280 --> 46:43.500
 Each neuron in your head has the entire human genome in it.

46:43.500 --> 46:47.580
 It's expressing millions of gene products.

46:47.580 --> 46:50.000
 These are incredibly complicated biochemical cascades.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.860
 Each one is connected to 10,000 of its neighbors,

46:51.860 --> 46:54.960
 which means you have like half a quadrillion connections

46:54.960 --> 46:55.800
 in the brain.

46:55.800 --> 46:58.180
 So it's incredibly complicated thing,

46:58.180 --> 47:01.560
 but it is fundamentally appears to just be a machine.

47:02.540 --> 47:04.980
 And therefore, if there's nothing in it

47:04.980 --> 47:07.420
 that's not being driven by something else,

47:07.420 --> 47:10.160
 then it seems it's hard to understand

47:10.160 --> 47:12.600
 where free will would come from.

47:12.600 --> 47:14.860
 So that's the camp that pretty much all of us fall into,

47:14.860 --> 47:18.120
 but I will say, our science is still quite young.

47:18.120 --> 47:20.860
 And I'm a fan of the history of science,

47:20.860 --> 47:22.780
 and the thing that always strikes me as interesting

47:22.780 --> 47:26.100
 is when you look back at any moment in science,

47:26.100 --> 47:28.500
 everybody believes something is true,

47:28.500 --> 47:31.340
 and they simply didn't know about

47:31.340 --> 47:33.180
 what Einstein revealed or whatever.

47:33.180 --> 47:35.140
 And so who knows?

47:35.140 --> 47:37.080
 And they all feel like that we've,

47:37.080 --> 47:38.620
 at any moment in history,

47:38.620 --> 47:40.700
 they all feel like we've converged to the final answer.

47:40.700 --> 47:41.800
 Exactly, exactly.

47:41.800 --> 47:43.780
 Like all the pieces of the puzzle are there.

47:43.780 --> 47:45.620
 And I think that's a funny illusion

47:45.620 --> 47:47.180
 that's worth getting rid of.

47:47.180 --> 47:49.540
 And in fact, this is what drives good science

47:49.540 --> 47:52.660
 is recognizing that we don't have most of the puzzle pieces.

47:52.660 --> 47:55.620
 So as far as the free will question goes, I don't know.

47:55.620 --> 47:57.060
 At the moment, it seems, wow,

47:57.060 --> 47:58.540
 it'd be really impossible to figure out

47:58.540 --> 48:00.020
 how something else could fit in there,

48:00.020 --> 48:02.720
 but 100 years from now,

48:02.720 --> 48:05.620
 our textbooks might be very different than they are now.

48:05.620 --> 48:07.620
 I mean, could I ask you to speculate

48:07.620 --> 48:11.060
 where do you think free will could be squeezed into there?

48:11.060 --> 48:12.900
 Like, what's that even,

48:14.580 --> 48:16.300
 is it possible that our brain just creates

48:16.300 --> 48:19.880
 kinds of illusions that are useful for us?

48:19.880 --> 48:24.200
 Or like what, where could it possibly be squeezed in?

48:24.200 --> 48:27.140
 Well, let me give a speculation answer

48:27.140 --> 48:28.740
 to your very nice question,

48:28.740 --> 48:32.180
 but don't, and the listeners of this podcast,

48:32.180 --> 48:33.140
 don't quote me on this.

48:33.140 --> 48:33.980
 Yeah, exactly.

48:33.980 --> 48:35.620
 I'm not saying this is what I believe to be true,

48:35.620 --> 48:36.740
 but let me just give an example.

48:36.740 --> 48:38.940
 I give this at the end of my book, Incognito.

48:38.940 --> 48:41.340
 So the whole book of Incognito is about,

48:41.340 --> 48:42.900
 all the what's happening in the brain.

48:42.900 --> 48:44.060
 And essentially I'm saying, look,

48:44.060 --> 48:45.460
 here's all the reasons to think

48:45.460 --> 48:47.020
 that free will probably does not exist.

48:47.020 --> 48:50.580
 But at the very end, I say, look,

48:50.580 --> 48:52.560
 imagine that you are,

48:53.860 --> 48:56.140
 imagine that you're a Kalahari Bushman

48:56.140 --> 48:58.900
 and you find a radio in the sand

48:58.900 --> 49:01.100
 and you've never seen anything like this.

49:01.100 --> 49:04.420
 And you look at this radio and you realize

49:04.420 --> 49:07.180
 that when you turn this knob, you hear voices coming from,

49:07.180 --> 49:08.700
 there are voices coming from it.

49:08.700 --> 49:11.700
 So being a radio materialist,

49:11.700 --> 49:14.020
 you try to figure out like, how does this thing operate?

49:14.020 --> 49:15.420
 So you take off the back cover

49:15.420 --> 49:16.780
 and you realize there's all these wires.

49:16.780 --> 49:19.740
 And when you take out some wires,

49:19.740 --> 49:22.140
 the voices get garbled or stop or whatever.

49:22.140 --> 49:24.300
 And so what you end up developing is a whole theory

49:24.300 --> 49:26.820
 about how this connection, this pattern of wires

49:26.820 --> 49:29.020
 gives rise to voices.

49:29.020 --> 49:31.780
 But it would never strike you that in distant cities,

49:31.780 --> 49:34.460
 there's a radio tower and there's invisible stuff beaming.

49:34.460 --> 49:36.780
 And that's actually the origin of the voices.

49:36.780 --> 49:38.700
 And this is just necessary for it.

49:38.700 --> 49:42.580
 So I mentioned this just as a speculation,

49:42.580 --> 49:44.100
 say, look, how would we know,

49:44.100 --> 49:46.060
 what we know about the brain for absolutely certain

49:46.060 --> 49:48.580
 is that when you damage pieces and parts of it,

49:48.580 --> 49:50.580
 things get jumbled up.

49:50.580 --> 49:52.680
 But how would you know if there's something else going on

49:52.680 --> 49:55.140
 that we can't see like electromagnetic radiation

49:55.140 --> 49:58.180
 that is what's actually generating this?

49:58.180 --> 50:01.420
 Yeah, you paint a beautiful example

50:01.420 --> 50:06.260
 of how totally,

50:06.260 --> 50:10.300
 because we don't know most of how our universe works,

50:10.300 --> 50:14.460
 how totally off base we might be with our science until,

50:14.460 --> 50:19.100
 I mean, yeah, I mean, that's inspiring, that's beautiful.

50:19.100 --> 50:21.780
 It's kind of terrifying, it's humbling.

50:21.780 --> 50:23.980
 It's all of the above.

50:23.980 --> 50:26.820
 And the important part just to recognize

50:26.820 --> 50:28.660
 is that of course we're in the position

50:28.660 --> 50:31.780
 of having massive unknowns.

50:31.780 --> 50:36.340
 And we have of course the known unknowns

50:36.340 --> 50:38.420
 and that's all the things we're pursuing in our labs

50:38.420 --> 50:39.260
 and trying to figure out that,

50:39.260 --> 50:41.620
 but there's this whole space of unknown unknowns.

50:41.620 --> 50:44.020
 Things we haven't even realized we haven't asked yet.

50:44.020 --> 50:47.660
 Let me kind of ask a weird, maybe a difficult question,

50:47.660 --> 50:50.580
 part that has to do with,

50:50.580 --> 50:54.340
 I've been recently reading a lot about World War II.

50:54.340 --> 50:56.620
 I'm currently reading a book I recommend for people,

50:56.620 --> 51:00.940
 which as a Jew has been difficult to read,

51:00.940 --> 51:04.020
 but the rise and fall of the Third Reich.

51:04.940 --> 51:08.900
 So let me just ask about like the nature of genius,

51:08.900 --> 51:10.460
 the nature of evil.

51:10.460 --> 51:14.220
 If we look at somebody like Einstein,

51:14.220 --> 51:19.220
 we look at Hitler, Stalin, modern day Jeffrey Epstein,

51:19.500 --> 51:24.500
 just folks who through their life have done with Einstein

51:24.500 --> 51:27.540
 and works of genius and with the others I mentioned

51:27.540 --> 51:29.420
 have done evil on this world.

51:30.580 --> 51:34.940
 What do we think about that in a livewired brain?

51:34.940 --> 51:39.580
 Like how do we think about these extreme people?

51:39.580 --> 51:41.700
 Here's what I'd say.

51:41.700 --> 51:43.540
 This is a very big and difficult question,

51:43.540 --> 51:45.380
 but what I would say briefly on it is,

51:47.620 --> 51:51.500
 first of all, I saw a cover of Time Magazine some years ago

51:51.500 --> 51:55.500
 and it was a big sagittal slice of the brain

51:55.500 --> 51:59.020
 and it said something like, what makes us good and evil?

51:59.020 --> 52:00.460
 And there was a little spot pointing to it

52:00.460 --> 52:01.300
 and there was a picture of Gandhi

52:01.300 --> 52:03.380
 and there was a little spot that was pointing to Hitler.

52:03.380 --> 52:05.780
 And these Time Magazine covers always make me mad

52:05.780 --> 52:08.660
 because it's so goofy to think that we're gonna find

52:08.660 --> 52:10.940
 some spot in the brain or something.

52:10.940 --> 52:15.940
 Instead, the interesting part is because we're livewired,

52:16.860 --> 52:20.580
 we are all about the world and the culture around us.

52:20.580 --> 52:25.580
 So somebody like Adolf Hitler got all this positive feedback

52:25.740 --> 52:28.780
 about what was going on and the crazier and crazier

52:28.780 --> 52:31.980
 the ideas he had and he's like, let's set up death camps

52:31.980 --> 52:34.140
 and murder a bunch of people and so on.

52:34.140 --> 52:37.340
 Somehow he was getting positive feedback from that

52:37.340 --> 52:40.300
 and all these other people, they're all spun each other up.

52:40.300 --> 52:45.300
 And you look at anything like, I mean, look at the cultural

52:45.300 --> 52:50.300
 revolution in China or the Russian revolution

52:51.180 --> 52:52.620
 or things like this where you look at these things,

52:52.620 --> 52:55.300
 my God, how do people all behave like this?

52:55.300 --> 52:58.860
 But it's easy to see groups of people spinning themselves up

52:58.860 --> 53:00.300
 in particular ways where they all say,

53:00.300 --> 53:03.820
 well, would I have thought this was right

53:03.820 --> 53:04.740
 in a different circumstance?

53:04.740 --> 53:05.940
 I don't know, but Fred thinks it's right

53:05.940 --> 53:06.780
 and Steve thinks it's right,

53:06.780 --> 53:08.180
 everyone around me seems to think it's right.

53:08.180 --> 53:13.060
 And so part of the maybe downside of having a livewired brain

53:13.060 --> 53:17.500
 is that you can get crowds of people doing things as a group.

53:17.500 --> 53:20.420
 So it's interesting to, we would pinpoint Hitler

53:20.420 --> 53:21.660
 as saying that's the evil guy.

53:21.660 --> 53:24.740
 But in a sense, I think it was Tolstoy who said

53:24.740 --> 53:29.740
 the king becomes slave to the people.

53:30.860 --> 53:34.740
 In other words, Hitler was just a representation

53:34.740 --> 53:37.420
 of whatever was going on with that huge crowd

53:37.420 --> 53:39.420
 that he was surrounded with.

53:39.420 --> 53:44.420
 So I only bring that up to say that it's very difficult

53:45.260 --> 53:48.340
 to say what it is about this person's brain

53:48.340 --> 53:49.180
 or that person's brain.

53:49.180 --> 53:51.660
 He obviously got feedback for what he was doing.

53:51.660 --> 53:52.820
 The other thing, by the way,

53:52.820 --> 53:57.300
 about what we often think of as being evil in society

53:57.300 --> 54:01.820
 is my lab recently published some work

54:01.820 --> 54:04.620
 on in groups and out groups,

54:04.620 --> 54:08.260
 which is a very important part of this puzzle.

54:08.260 --> 54:13.260
 So it turns out that we are very engineered

54:13.860 --> 54:16.060
 to care about in groups versus out groups.

54:16.060 --> 54:18.700
 And this seems to be like a really fundamental thing.

54:18.700 --> 54:20.140
 So we did this experiment in my lab

54:20.140 --> 54:23.420
 where we brought people and we stick them in the scanner.

54:23.420 --> 54:25.020
 And we, I don't know if you noticed,

54:25.020 --> 54:30.020
 but we show them on the screen six hands

54:30.700 --> 54:33.460
 and the computer goes around randomly picks a hand.

54:33.460 --> 54:34.980
 And then you see that hand gets stabbed

54:34.980 --> 54:36.060
 with a syringe needle.

54:36.060 --> 54:38.260
 So you actually see a syringe needle enter the hand

54:38.260 --> 54:39.100
 and come out.

54:39.100 --> 54:41.940
 And it's really, what that does is that triggers

54:42.940 --> 54:44.540
 parts of the pain matrix,

54:44.540 --> 54:46.140
 this areas in your brain that are involved

54:46.140 --> 54:47.260
 in feeling physical pain.

54:47.260 --> 54:48.860
 Now, the interesting thing is it's not your hand

54:48.860 --> 54:49.940
 that was stabbed.

54:49.940 --> 54:51.620
 So what you're seeing is empathy.

54:51.620 --> 54:54.140
 This is you seeing someone else's hand gets stabbed.

54:54.140 --> 54:56.220
 You feel like, oh God, this is awful, right?

54:56.220 --> 54:57.420
 Okay.

54:57.420 --> 54:58.580
 We contrast that by the way,

54:58.580 --> 55:00.820
 with somebody's hand getting poked as a Q tip,

55:00.820 --> 55:02.540
 which is, you know, looks visually the same,

55:02.540 --> 55:06.100
 but you don't have that same level of response.

55:06.100 --> 55:10.100
 Now what we do is we label each hand with a one word label,

55:10.980 --> 55:14.340
 Christian, Jewish, Muslim, atheist, Scientologist, Hindu.

55:14.340 --> 55:16.940
 And now the computer goes around, picks a hand,

55:16.940 --> 55:17.900
 stabs the hand.

55:17.900 --> 55:21.420
 And the question is, how much does your brain care

55:21.420 --> 55:23.220
 about all the people in your out group

55:23.220 --> 55:25.700
 versus the one label that happens to match you?

55:26.660 --> 55:29.140
 And it turns out for everybody across all religions,

55:29.140 --> 55:31.020
 they care much more about their in group

55:31.020 --> 55:31.860
 than their out group.

55:31.860 --> 55:33.420
 And when I say they care, what I mean is

55:33.420 --> 55:35.580
 you get a bigger response from their brain.

55:35.580 --> 55:36.420
 Everything's the same.

55:36.420 --> 55:38.820
 It's the same hands.

55:38.820 --> 55:40.620
 It's just a one word label.

55:40.620 --> 55:42.900
 You care much more about your in group than your out group.

55:42.900 --> 55:45.700
 And I wish this weren't true, but this is how humans are.

55:45.700 --> 55:47.820
 I wonder how fundamental that is,

55:47.820 --> 55:52.820
 or if it's the emergent thing about culture.

55:53.220 --> 55:55.540
 Like if we lived alone with like,

55:55.540 --> 55:57.500
 if it's genetically built into the brain,

55:57.500 --> 56:00.300
 like this longing for tribe.

56:00.300 --> 56:02.300
 So I'll tell you, we addressed that.

56:02.300 --> 56:03.260
 So here's what we did.

56:03.260 --> 56:06.820
 There are two, actually there are two other things

56:06.820 --> 56:07.860
 we did as part of this study

56:07.860 --> 56:09.580
 that I think matter for this point.

56:09.580 --> 56:11.740
 One is, so okay, so we show that you have

56:11.740 --> 56:13.020
 a much bigger response.

56:13.020 --> 56:14.460
 And by the way, this is not a cognitive thing.

56:14.460 --> 56:17.460
 This is a very low level basic response

56:17.460 --> 56:19.060
 to seeing pain in somebody, okay.

56:19.060 --> 56:20.060
 Great study by the way.

56:20.060 --> 56:21.940
 Thanks, thanks, thanks.

56:21.940 --> 56:24.820
 What we did next is we next have it where we say,

56:24.820 --> 56:28.700
 okay, the year is 2025 and these three religions

56:28.700 --> 56:30.780
 are now in a war against these three religions.

56:30.780 --> 56:31.820
 And it's all randomized, right?

56:31.820 --> 56:34.980
 But what you see is your thing and you have two allies now

56:34.980 --> 56:36.020
 against these others.

56:37.100 --> 56:38.700
 And now it happens over the course of many trials,

56:38.700 --> 56:41.620
 you see everybody gets stabbed at different times.

56:41.620 --> 56:43.500
 And the question is, do you care more about your allies?

56:43.500 --> 56:44.340
 And the answer is yes.

56:44.340 --> 56:45.940
 Suddenly people who a moment ago,

56:45.940 --> 56:47.300
 you didn't really care when they got stabbed.

56:47.300 --> 56:49.740
 Now, simply with this one word thing

56:49.740 --> 56:52.700
 that they're now your allies, you care more about them.

56:52.700 --> 56:55.340
 But then what I wanted to do was look at

56:55.340 --> 56:57.660
 how ingrained is this or how arbitrary is it?

56:57.660 --> 57:01.460
 So we brought new participants in and we said,

57:01.460 --> 57:02.700
 here's a coin, toss the coin.

57:02.700 --> 57:04.140
 If it's heads, you're an Augustinian.

57:04.140 --> 57:06.140
 If it's a tails, you're a Justinian.

57:06.140 --> 57:08.020
 These are totally made up.

57:08.020 --> 57:10.100
 Okay, so they toss it, they get whatever.

57:10.100 --> 57:13.380
 We give them a band that says Augustinian on it,

57:13.380 --> 57:16.740
 whatever tribe they're in now, and they get in the scanner

57:16.740 --> 57:18.500
 and they see a thing on the screen that says

57:18.500 --> 57:21.100
 the Augustinians and Justinians are two warring tribes.

57:21.100 --> 57:22.180
 Then you see a bunch of hands,

57:22.180 --> 57:24.620
 some are labeled Augustinians, some are Justinian.

57:24.620 --> 57:27.820
 And now you care more about whichever team you're on

57:27.820 --> 57:29.740
 than the other team, even though it's totally arbitrary

57:29.740 --> 57:30.580
 and you know it's arbitrary

57:30.580 --> 57:32.900
 because you're the one who tossed the coin.

57:32.900 --> 57:36.980
 So it's a state that's very easy to find ourselves in.

57:36.980 --> 57:39.500
 In other words, just before walking in the door,

57:39.500 --> 57:41.700
 they'd never even heard of Augustinian versus Justinian

57:41.700 --> 57:43.940
 and now their brain is representing it

57:43.940 --> 57:46.380
 simply because they're told they're on this team.

57:46.380 --> 57:49.620
 You know, now I did my own personal study of this.

57:49.620 --> 57:54.620
 So once you're an Augustinian, that tends to be sticky

57:55.500 --> 57:57.460
 because I've been a Packers fan,

57:57.460 --> 57:59.100
 grew to be a Packers fan my whole life.

57:59.100 --> 58:03.020
 Now when I'm in Boston with like the Patriots,

58:03.020 --> 58:05.420
 it's been tough going for my livewired brain

58:05.420 --> 58:07.980
 to switch to the Patriots.

58:07.980 --> 58:10.020
 So once you become, it's as interesting,

58:10.020 --> 58:12.140
 once the tribe is sticky.

58:12.140 --> 58:14.180
 Yeah, I'll admit that's true.

58:14.180 --> 58:15.020
 That's it, you know.

58:15.020 --> 58:16.620
 You know, we never tried that about saying,

58:16.620 --> 58:19.140
 okay, now you're a Justinian and you were an Augustinian.

58:19.140 --> 58:21.820
 We never saw how sticky it is.

58:21.820 --> 58:24.380
 But there are studies of this,

58:24.380 --> 58:28.500
 of monkey troops on some island.

58:30.060 --> 58:33.580
 And what happens is they look at the way monkeys behave

58:33.580 --> 58:34.460
 when they're part of this tribe

58:34.460 --> 58:37.580
 and how they treat members of the other tribe of monkeys.

58:37.580 --> 58:39.500
 And then what they do, I've forgotten how they do that,

58:39.500 --> 58:42.060
 exactly, but they end up switching a monkey

58:42.060 --> 58:43.100
 so he ends up in the other troop.

58:43.100 --> 58:45.220
 And very quickly they end up becoming a part

58:45.220 --> 58:48.180
 of that other troop and hating and behaving badly

58:48.180 --> 58:50.380
 towards the original troop.

58:50.380 --> 58:52.500
 These are fascinating studies, by the way.

58:52.500 --> 58:55.020
 This is beautiful.

58:55.020 --> 59:00.020
 In your book, you have a good light bulb joke.

59:01.220 --> 59:04.460
 How many psychiatrists does it take to change a light bulb?

59:04.460 --> 59:07.900
 Only one, but the light bulb has to want to change.

59:07.900 --> 59:08.740
 Sorry.

59:09.700 --> 59:11.780
 I'm a sucker for a good light bulb joke.

59:11.780 --> 59:15.100
 Okay, so given, you know, I've been interested

59:15.100 --> 59:19.140
 in psychiatry my whole life, just maybe tangentially.

59:19.140 --> 59:22.500
 I've kind of early on dreamed to be a psychiatrist

59:22.500 --> 59:24.420
 until I understood what it entails.

59:25.660 --> 59:30.660
 But, you know, is there hope for psychiatry

59:31.940 --> 59:36.940
 for somebody else to help this live, wired brain to adjust?

59:37.260 --> 59:40.180
 Oh yeah, I mean, in the sense that,

59:40.180 --> 59:41.180
 and this has to do with this issue

59:41.180 --> 59:43.220
 about us being trapped on our own planet.

59:43.220 --> 59:45.900
 Forget psychiatrists, just think of like

59:45.900 --> 59:47.020
 when you're talking with a friend

59:47.020 --> 59:48.900
 and you say, oh, I'm so upset about this.

59:48.900 --> 59:51.500
 And your friend says, hey, just look at it this way.

59:53.300 --> 59:55.780
 You know, all we have access to under normal circumstances

59:55.780 --> 59:57.420
 is just the way we're seeing something.

59:57.420 --> 1:00:02.180
 And so it's super helpful to have friends and communities

1:00:02.180 --> 1:00:05.740
 and psychiatrists and so on to help things change that way.

1:00:05.740 --> 1:00:07.220
 So that's how psychiatrists sort of helped us.

1:00:07.220 --> 1:00:10.500
 But more importantly, the role that psychiatrists have played

1:00:10.500 --> 1:00:13.940
 is that there's this sort of naive assumption

1:00:13.940 --> 1:00:15.140
 that we all come to the table with,

1:00:15.140 --> 1:00:18.340
 which is that everyone is fundamentally just like us.

1:00:18.340 --> 1:00:21.140
 And when you're a kid, you believe this entirely,

1:00:21.140 --> 1:00:22.780
 but as you get older and you start realizing,

1:00:22.780 --> 1:00:25.260
 okay, there's something called schizophrenia

1:00:25.260 --> 1:00:26.300
 and that's a real thing.

1:00:26.300 --> 1:00:29.100
 And to be inside that person's head is totally different

1:00:29.100 --> 1:00:32.140
 than what it is to be inside my head or their psychopathy.

1:00:32.140 --> 1:00:34.900
 And to be inside the psychopath's head,

1:00:34.900 --> 1:00:36.300
 he doesn't care about other people.

1:00:36.300 --> 1:00:37.460
 He doesn't care about hurting other people.

1:00:37.460 --> 1:00:40.900
 He's just doing what he needs to do to get what he needs.

1:00:40.900 --> 1:00:42.100
 That's a different head.

1:00:42.100 --> 1:00:45.540
 There's a million different things going on

1:00:45.540 --> 1:00:47.740
 and it is different to be inside those heads.

1:00:48.860 --> 1:00:51.300
 This is where the field of psychiatry comes in.

1:00:51.300 --> 1:00:53.380
 Now, I think it's an interesting question

1:00:53.380 --> 1:00:57.020
 about the degree to which neuroscience is leaking into

1:00:57.020 --> 1:00:58.540
 and taking over psychiatry

1:00:58.540 --> 1:01:00.860
 and what the landscape will look like 50 years from now.

1:01:00.860 --> 1:01:05.860
 It may be that psychiatry as a profession changes a lot

1:01:05.860 --> 1:01:07.220
 or maybe goes away entirely,

1:01:07.220 --> 1:01:09.220
 and neuroscience will essentially be able

1:01:09.220 --> 1:01:10.420
 to take over some of these functions,

1:01:10.420 --> 1:01:14.220
 but it has been extremely useful to understand

1:01:14.220 --> 1:01:18.220
 the differences between how people behave and why

1:01:18.220 --> 1:01:19.580
 and what you can tell about what's going on

1:01:19.580 --> 1:01:22.380
 inside their brain just based on observation

1:01:22.380 --> 1:01:23.420
 of their behavior.

1:01:25.220 --> 1:01:28.340
 This might be years ago, but I'm not sure.

1:01:28.340 --> 1:01:30.300
 There's an Atlantic article you've written

1:01:32.300 --> 1:01:34.460
 about moving away from a distinction

1:01:34.460 --> 1:01:36.900
 between neurological disorders,

1:01:36.900 --> 1:01:39.100
 quote unquote, brain problems,

1:01:39.100 --> 1:01:43.820
 and psychiatric disorders or quote unquote, mind problems.

1:01:43.820 --> 1:01:47.220
 So on that topic, how do you think about this gray area?

1:01:47.220 --> 1:01:50.580
 Yeah, this is exactly the evolution that things are going

1:01:50.580 --> 1:01:54.140
 is there was psychiatry and then there were guys and gals

1:01:54.140 --> 1:01:55.940
 in labs poking cells and so on.

1:01:55.940 --> 1:01:57.020
 Those were the neuroscientists.

1:01:57.020 --> 1:01:58.860
 But yeah, I think these are moving together

1:01:58.860 --> 1:02:00.580
 for exactly the reason you just cited.

1:02:00.580 --> 1:02:02.540
 And where this matters a lot,

1:02:02.540 --> 1:02:04.660
 the Atlantic article that I wrote

1:02:04.660 --> 1:02:06.780
 was called The Brain on Trial,

1:02:06.780 --> 1:02:09.580
 where this matters a lot is the legal system

1:02:09.580 --> 1:02:12.740
 because the way we run our legal system now,

1:02:12.740 --> 1:02:13.900
 and this is true everywhere in the world,

1:02:13.900 --> 1:02:17.420
 is someone shows up in front of the judge's bench,

1:02:17.420 --> 1:02:18.540
 or let's say there's five people

1:02:18.540 --> 1:02:20.100
 in front of the judge's bench,

1:02:20.100 --> 1:02:21.380
 and they've all committed the same crime.

1:02:21.380 --> 1:02:23.820
 What we do, because we feel like, hey, this is fair,

1:02:23.820 --> 1:02:25.580
 is we say, all right, you're gonna get the same sentence.

1:02:25.580 --> 1:02:27.780
 You'll all get three years in prison or whatever it is.

1:02:27.780 --> 1:02:29.780
 But in fact, brains can be so different.

1:02:29.780 --> 1:02:31.580
 This guy's got schizophrenia, this guy's a psychopath,

1:02:31.580 --> 1:02:33.620
 this guy's tweaked down on drugs, and so on and so on,

1:02:33.620 --> 1:02:37.620
 that it actually doesn't make sense to keep doing that.

1:02:37.620 --> 1:02:41.220
 And what we do in this country more than anywhere

1:02:41.220 --> 1:02:44.100
 in the world is we imagine that incarceration

1:02:44.100 --> 1:02:45.500
 is a one size fits all solution.

1:02:45.500 --> 1:02:47.300
 And you may know we have the,

1:02:47.300 --> 1:02:49.140
 America has the highest incarceration rate

1:02:49.140 --> 1:02:50.860
 in the whole world in terms of the percentage

1:02:50.860 --> 1:02:52.860
 of our population we put behind bars.

1:02:52.860 --> 1:02:56.580
 So there's a much more refined thing we can do

1:02:56.580 --> 1:02:59.180
 as neuroscience comes in and changes,

1:02:59.180 --> 1:03:01.900
 and has the opportunity to change the legal system.

1:03:01.900 --> 1:03:03.980
 Which is to say, this doesn't let anybody off the hook.

1:03:03.980 --> 1:03:06.100
 It doesn't say, oh, it's not your fault, and so on.

1:03:06.100 --> 1:03:09.380
 But what it does is it changes the equation

1:03:09.380 --> 1:03:12.940
 so it's not about, hey, how blameworthy are you?

1:03:12.940 --> 1:03:15.220
 But instead is about, hey, what do we do from here?

1:03:15.220 --> 1:03:16.260
 What's the best thing to do from here?

1:03:16.260 --> 1:03:17.740
 So if you take somebody with schizophrenia

1:03:17.740 --> 1:03:21.100
 and you have them break rocks in the hot summer sun

1:03:21.100 --> 1:03:24.500
 in a chain gang, that doesn't help their schizophrenia.

1:03:24.500 --> 1:03:25.900
 That doesn't fix the problem.

1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:28.020
 If you take somebody with a drug addiction

1:03:28.020 --> 1:03:30.660
 who's in jail for being caught with two ounces

1:03:30.660 --> 1:03:34.500
 of some illegal substance, and you put them in prison,

1:03:34.500 --> 1:03:36.020
 it doesn't actually fix the addiction.

1:03:36.020 --> 1:03:37.260
 It doesn't help anything.

1:03:38.580 --> 1:03:40.580
 Happily, what neuroscience and psychiatry

1:03:40.580 --> 1:03:43.260
 bring to the table is lots of really useful things

1:03:43.260 --> 1:03:45.620
 you can do with schizophrenia, with drug addiction,

1:03:45.620 --> 1:03:46.940
 things like this.

1:03:46.940 --> 1:03:49.140
 And that's why, so I don't know if you guys

1:03:49.140 --> 1:03:50.540
 better run a national law and profit

1:03:50.540 --> 1:03:52.140
 called the Center for Science and Law.

1:03:52.140 --> 1:03:53.660
 And it's all about this intersection

1:03:53.660 --> 1:03:55.140
 of neuroscience and psychiatry.

1:03:55.140 --> 1:03:57.340
 It's the intersection of neuroscience and legal system.

1:03:57.340 --> 1:03:59.060
 And we're trying to implement changes

1:03:59.060 --> 1:04:01.660
 in every county, in every state.

1:04:02.540 --> 1:04:04.700
 I'll just, without going down that rabbit hole,

1:04:04.700 --> 1:04:07.540
 I'll just say one of the very simplest things to do

1:04:07.540 --> 1:04:09.140
 is to set up specialized court systems

1:04:09.140 --> 1:04:12.660
 where you have a mental health court

1:04:12.660 --> 1:04:14.980
 that has judges and juries with expertise

1:04:14.980 --> 1:04:15.820
 in mental illness.

1:04:15.820 --> 1:04:17.780
 Because if you go, by the way, to a regular court

1:04:17.780 --> 1:04:21.220
 and the person says, or the defense lawyer says,

1:04:21.220 --> 1:04:24.300
 this person has schizophrenia, most of the jury will say,

1:04:24.300 --> 1:04:25.780
 man, I call bullshit on that.

1:04:25.780 --> 1:04:26.620
 Why?

1:04:26.620 --> 1:04:28.660
 Because they don't know about schizophrenia.

1:04:28.660 --> 1:04:30.780
 They don't know what it's about.

1:04:30.780 --> 1:04:34.500
 And it turns out people who know about schizophrenia

1:04:34.500 --> 1:04:35.900
 feel very differently as a juror

1:04:35.900 --> 1:04:37.740
 than someone who happens not to know anybody with

1:04:37.740 --> 1:04:39.540
 schizophrenia, they think it's an excuse.

1:04:39.540 --> 1:04:42.380
 So you have judges and juries with expertise

1:04:42.380 --> 1:04:44.180
 in mental illness and they know the rehabilitative

1:04:44.180 --> 1:04:45.780
 strategies that are available.

1:04:45.780 --> 1:04:46.620
 That's one thing.

1:04:46.620 --> 1:04:48.500
 Having a drug court where you have judges and juries

1:04:48.500 --> 1:04:50.540
 with expertise in rehabilitative strategies

1:04:50.540 --> 1:04:51.860
 and what can be done and so on.

1:04:51.860 --> 1:04:54.140
 A specialized prostitution court and so on.

1:04:54.140 --> 1:04:55.700
 All these different things.

1:04:55.700 --> 1:04:57.620
 By the way, this is very easy for counties

1:04:57.620 --> 1:04:59.260
 to implement this sort of thing.

1:04:59.260 --> 1:05:01.820
 And this is, I think, where this matters

1:05:01.820 --> 1:05:05.020
 to get neuroscience into public policy.

1:05:05.020 --> 1:05:08.620
 What's the process of injecting expertise into this?

1:05:08.620 --> 1:05:10.540
 Yeah, I'll tell you exactly what it is.

1:05:10.540 --> 1:05:12.420
 A county needs to run out of money first.

1:05:12.420 --> 1:05:14.460
 I've seen this happen over and over.

1:05:14.460 --> 1:05:17.220
 So what happens is a county has a completely full jail

1:05:17.220 --> 1:05:18.540
 and they say, you know what?

1:05:18.540 --> 1:05:19.780
 We need to build another jail.

1:05:19.780 --> 1:05:21.220
 And then they realize, God, we don't have any money.

1:05:21.220 --> 1:05:22.260
 We can't afford this.

1:05:22.260 --> 1:05:23.260
 We've got too many people in jail.

1:05:23.260 --> 1:05:25.500
 And that's when they turn to,

1:05:25.500 --> 1:05:26.700
 God, we need something smarter.

1:05:26.700 --> 1:05:28.700
 And that's when they set up specialized court systems.

1:05:28.700 --> 1:05:29.540
 Yeah.

1:05:30.940 --> 1:05:34.300
 We're all function best when our back is against the wall.

1:05:34.300 --> 1:05:36.180
 And that's what COVID is good for.

1:05:36.180 --> 1:05:38.380
 It's because we've all had our routines

1:05:38.380 --> 1:05:40.820
 and we are optimized for the things we do.

1:05:40.820 --> 1:05:43.020
 And suddenly our backs are against the wall, all of us.

1:05:43.020 --> 1:05:44.620
 Yeah, it's really, I mean,

1:05:44.620 --> 1:05:47.580
 one of the exciting things about COVID.

1:05:47.580 --> 1:05:51.940
 I mean, I'm a big believer in the possibility

1:05:51.940 --> 1:05:56.140
 of what government can do for the people.

1:05:56.140 --> 1:05:59.180
 And when it becomes too big of a bureaucracy,

1:05:59.180 --> 1:06:02.580
 it starts functioning poorly, it starts wasting money.

1:06:02.580 --> 1:06:07.140
 It's nice to, I mean, COVID reveals that nicely.

1:06:07.140 --> 1:06:11.700
 And lessons to be learned about who gets elected

1:06:11.700 --> 1:06:14.180
 and who goes into government.

1:06:14.180 --> 1:06:18.860
 Hopefully this, hopefully this inspires talented

1:06:18.860 --> 1:06:20.780
 and young people to go into government

1:06:20.780 --> 1:06:23.580
 to revolutionize different aspects of it.

1:06:23.580 --> 1:06:28.580
 Yeah, so that's the positive silver lining of COVID.

1:06:28.660 --> 1:06:30.740
 I mean, I thought it'd be fun to ask you,

1:06:30.740 --> 1:06:31.900
 I don't know if you're paying attention

1:06:31.900 --> 1:06:34.620
 to the machine learning world and GPT3.

1:06:37.100 --> 1:06:39.260
 So the GPT3 is this language model,

1:06:39.260 --> 1:06:41.180
 this neural network that's able to,

1:06:41.180 --> 1:06:44.860
 it has 175 billion parameters.

1:06:44.860 --> 1:06:47.820
 So it's very large and it's trained

1:06:47.820 --> 1:06:51.540
 in an unsupervised way on the internet.

1:06:51.540 --> 1:06:55.780
 It just reads a lot of unstructured texts

1:06:55.780 --> 1:06:59.420
 and it's able to generate some pretty impressive things.

1:06:59.420 --> 1:07:02.020
 The human brain compared to that has about,

1:07:02.020 --> 1:07:05.980
 you know, a thousand times more synapses.

1:07:05.980 --> 1:07:10.060
 People get so upset when machine learning people

1:07:10.060 --> 1:07:14.380
 compare the brain and we know synapses are different.

1:07:14.380 --> 1:07:16.860
 It was very different, very different.

1:07:16.860 --> 1:07:20.580
 But like, do you, what do you think about GPT3?

1:07:20.580 --> 1:07:22.660
 Here's what I think, here's what I think, a few things.

1:07:22.660 --> 1:07:25.580
 What GPT3 is doing is extremely impressive,

1:07:25.580 --> 1:07:27.620
 but it's very different from what the brain does.

1:07:27.620 --> 1:07:32.620
 So it's a good impersonator, but just as one example,

1:07:33.060 --> 1:07:37.500
 everybody takes a passage that GPT3 has written

1:07:37.500 --> 1:07:40.420
 and they say, wow, look at this, and it's pretty good, right?

1:07:40.420 --> 1:07:42.420
 But it's already gone through a filtering process

1:07:42.420 --> 1:07:43.740
 of humans looking at it and saying,

1:07:43.740 --> 1:07:45.340
 okay, well that's crap, that's crap, okay.

1:07:45.340 --> 1:07:47.500
 Oh, here's a sentence that's pretty cool.

1:07:47.500 --> 1:07:49.940
 Now here's the thing, human creativity

1:07:49.940 --> 1:07:51.740
 is about absorbing everything around it

1:07:51.740 --> 1:07:53.420
 and remixing that and coming up with stuff.

1:07:53.420 --> 1:07:55.420
 So in that sense, we're sort of like GPT3,

1:07:55.420 --> 1:07:58.820
 you know, we're remixing what we've gotten in before.

1:07:59.700 --> 1:08:03.140
 But we also know, we also have very good models

1:08:03.140 --> 1:08:04.780
 of what it is to be another human.

1:08:04.780 --> 1:08:08.220
 And so, you know, I don't know if you speak French

1:08:08.220 --> 1:08:09.820
 or something, but I'm not gonna start speaking in French

1:08:09.820 --> 1:08:11.500
 because then you'll say, wait, what are you doing?

1:08:11.500 --> 1:08:12.420
 I don't understand it.

1:08:12.420 --> 1:08:14.700
 Instead, everything coming out of my mouth

1:08:14.700 --> 1:08:16.260
 is meant for your ears.

1:08:16.260 --> 1:08:18.140
 I know what you'll understand.

1:08:18.140 --> 1:08:20.140
 I know the vocabulary that you know and don't know.

1:08:20.140 --> 1:08:21.860
 I know what parts you care about.

1:08:23.740 --> 1:08:25.140
 That's a huge part of it.

1:08:25.140 --> 1:08:28.580
 And so of all the possible sentences I could say,

1:08:29.420 --> 1:08:31.700
 I'm navigating this thin bandwidth

1:08:31.700 --> 1:08:34.540
 so that it's something useful for our conversation.

1:08:34.540 --> 1:08:36.740
 Yeah, in real time, but also throughout your life.

1:08:36.740 --> 1:08:39.740
 I mean, we're co evolving together.

1:08:39.740 --> 1:08:42.980
 We're learning how to communicate together.

1:08:42.980 --> 1:08:46.220
 Exactly, but this is what GPT3 does not do.

1:08:46.220 --> 1:08:47.300
 All it's doing is saying, okay,

1:08:47.300 --> 1:08:49.500
 I'm gonna take all these senses and remix stuff

1:08:49.500 --> 1:08:51.100
 and pop some stuff out.

1:08:51.100 --> 1:08:52.540
 But it doesn't know how to make it

1:08:52.540 --> 1:08:54.340
 so that you, Lex, will feel like,

1:08:54.340 --> 1:08:56.820
 oh yeah, that's exactly what I needed to hear.

1:08:56.820 --> 1:08:59.700
 That's the next sentence that I needed to know about

1:08:59.700 --> 1:09:00.540
 for something.

1:09:00.540 --> 1:09:02.860
 Well, of course, it could be,

1:09:02.860 --> 1:09:04.220
 all the impressive results we see.

1:09:04.220 --> 1:09:07.700
 The question is, if you raise the number of parameters,

1:09:07.700 --> 1:09:09.980
 whether it's going to be after some...

1:09:09.980 --> 1:09:11.020
 It will not be.

1:09:11.020 --> 1:09:11.860
 It will not be.

1:09:11.860 --> 1:09:14.060
 Raising more parameters won't...

1:09:14.060 --> 1:09:15.180
 Here's the thing.

1:09:15.180 --> 1:09:16.740
 It's not that I don't think neural networks

1:09:16.740 --> 1:09:18.100
 can't be like the human brain,

1:09:18.100 --> 1:09:20.420
 because I suspect they will be at some point, 50 years.

1:09:20.420 --> 1:09:21.260
 Who knows?

1:09:21.260 --> 1:09:26.020
 But what we are missing in artificial neural networks

1:09:26.020 --> 1:09:29.300
 is we've got this basic structure where you've got units

1:09:29.300 --> 1:09:32.420
 and you've got synapses that are connected.

1:09:32.420 --> 1:09:33.380
 And that's great.

1:09:33.380 --> 1:09:35.820
 And it's done incredibly mind blowing, impressive things,

1:09:35.820 --> 1:09:40.260
 but it's not doing the same algorithms as the human brain.

1:09:40.260 --> 1:09:43.620
 So when I look at my children, as little kids,

1:09:43.620 --> 1:09:47.660
 as infants, they can do things that no GPT3 can do.

1:09:47.660 --> 1:09:50.620
 They can navigate a complex room.

1:09:50.620 --> 1:09:54.900
 They can navigate social conversation with an adult.

1:09:54.900 --> 1:09:55.740
 They can lie.

1:09:55.740 --> 1:09:58.180
 They can do a million things.

1:09:58.180 --> 1:10:03.180
 They are active thinkers in our world and doing things.

1:10:03.180 --> 1:10:04.580
 And this, of course, I mean, look,

1:10:04.580 --> 1:10:07.820
 we totally agree on how incredibly awesome

1:10:07.820 --> 1:10:09.060
 artificial neural networks are right now,

1:10:09.060 --> 1:10:12.780
 but we also know the things that they can't do well,

1:10:12.780 --> 1:10:14.900
 like be generally intelligent,

1:10:14.900 --> 1:10:16.380
 do all these different things.

1:10:16.380 --> 1:10:17.620
 The reason about the world,

1:10:17.620 --> 1:10:19.900
 efficiently learn, efficiently adapt.

1:10:19.900 --> 1:10:20.740
 Exactly.

1:10:20.740 --> 1:10:23.540
 But it's still the rate of improvement.

1:10:23.540 --> 1:10:28.100
 It's, to me, it's possible that we'll be surprised.

1:10:28.100 --> 1:10:30.020
 I agree, possible we'll be surprised.

1:10:30.020 --> 1:10:33.060
 But what I would assert,

1:10:33.060 --> 1:10:36.180
 and I'm glad I'm getting to say this on your podcast,

1:10:36.180 --> 1:10:38.340
 we can look back at this in two years and 10 years,

1:10:38.340 --> 1:10:41.580
 is that we've got to be much more sophisticated

1:10:41.580 --> 1:10:44.740
 than units and synapses between them.

1:10:44.740 --> 1:10:45.660
 Let me give you an example,

1:10:45.660 --> 1:10:47.220
 and this is something I talk about in LiveWired,

1:10:47.220 --> 1:10:50.540
 is despite the amazing impressiveness,

1:10:50.540 --> 1:10:52.340
 mind blowing impressiveness,

1:10:52.340 --> 1:10:54.580
 computers don't have some basic things,

1:10:54.580 --> 1:10:56.580
 artificial neural networks don't have some basic things

1:10:56.580 --> 1:10:59.460
 that we like caring about relevance, for example.

1:10:59.460 --> 1:11:02.380
 So as humans, we are confronted

1:11:02.380 --> 1:11:03.900
 with tons of data all the time,

1:11:03.900 --> 1:11:05.620
 and we only encode particular things

1:11:05.620 --> 1:11:07.740
 that are relevant to us.

1:11:07.740 --> 1:11:10.060
 We have this very deep sense of relevance

1:11:10.060 --> 1:11:11.900
 that I mentioned earlier is based on survival

1:11:11.900 --> 1:11:12.740
 at the most basic level,

1:11:12.740 --> 1:11:16.420
 but then all the things about my life and your life,

1:11:16.420 --> 1:11:18.740
 what's relevant to you, that we encode.

1:11:19.660 --> 1:11:20.500
 This is very useful.

1:11:20.500 --> 1:11:21.980
 Computers at the moment don't have that.

1:11:21.980 --> 1:11:24.020
 They don't even have a yen to survive

1:11:24.020 --> 1:11:24.860
 and things like that.

1:11:24.860 --> 1:11:27.500
 So we filled out a bunch of the junk we don't need.

1:11:27.500 --> 1:11:29.900
 We're really good at efficiently

1:11:29.900 --> 1:11:31.460
 zooming in on things we need.

1:11:32.580 --> 1:11:34.500
 Again, could be argued, you know,

1:11:34.500 --> 1:11:35.940
 let me put on my Freud hat.

1:11:35.940 --> 1:11:39.660
 Maybe it's, I mean, that's our conscious mind.

1:11:42.540 --> 1:11:44.060
 There's no reason that neural networks

1:11:44.060 --> 1:11:46.140
 aren't doing the same kind of filtration.

1:11:46.140 --> 1:11:48.500
 I mean, in the sense with GPT3 is doing,

1:11:48.500 --> 1:11:50.820
 so there's a priming step.

1:11:50.820 --> 1:11:53.420
 It's doing an essential kind of filtration

1:11:53.420 --> 1:11:58.100
 when you ask it to generate tweets from,

1:11:58.100 --> 1:12:00.780
 I don't know, from an Elon Musk or something like that.

1:12:00.780 --> 1:12:04.060
 It's doing a filtration of it's throwing away

1:12:04.060 --> 1:12:06.900
 all the parameters it doesn't need for this task.

1:12:06.900 --> 1:12:09.700
 And it's figuring out how to do that successfully.

1:12:09.700 --> 1:12:12.100
 And then ultimately it's not doing a very good job

1:12:12.100 --> 1:12:14.340
 right now, but it's doing a lot better job

1:12:14.340 --> 1:12:15.460
 than we expected.

1:12:15.460 --> 1:12:17.500
 But it won't ever do a really good job.

1:12:17.500 --> 1:12:18.340
 And I'll tell you why.

1:12:18.340 --> 1:12:20.100
 I mean, so let's say we say,

1:12:20.100 --> 1:12:21.660
 hey, produce an Elon Musk tweet.

1:12:21.660 --> 1:12:23.980
 And we see like, oh, wow, it produced these three.

1:12:23.980 --> 1:12:24.820
 That's great.

1:12:24.820 --> 1:12:27.500
 But again, we're not seeing the 3000 produced

1:12:27.500 --> 1:12:28.900
 that didn't really make any sense.

1:12:28.900 --> 1:12:32.700
 It's because it has no idea what it is like to be a human.

1:12:32.700 --> 1:12:34.540
 And all the things that you might want to say

1:12:34.540 --> 1:12:35.380
 and all the reasons you wouldn't,

1:12:35.380 --> 1:12:37.100
 like when you go to write a tweet,

1:12:37.100 --> 1:12:38.140
 you might write something you think,

1:12:38.140 --> 1:12:39.860
 ah, it's not gonna come off quite right

1:12:39.860 --> 1:12:41.580
 in this modern political climate or whatever.

1:12:41.580 --> 1:12:43.340
 Like, you know, you can change things.

1:12:43.340 --> 1:12:44.180
 So.

1:12:44.180 --> 1:12:46.700
 And it somehow boils down to fear of mortality

1:12:46.700 --> 1:12:49.940
 and all of these human things at the end of the day,

1:12:49.940 --> 1:12:52.500
 all contained with that tweeting experience.

1:12:52.500 --> 1:12:55.540
 Well, interestingly, the fear of mortality

1:12:55.540 --> 1:12:56.860
 is at the bottom of this,

1:12:56.860 --> 1:12:58.700
 but you've got all these more things like,

1:12:58.700 --> 1:13:01.220
 you know, oh, I want to,

1:13:01.220 --> 1:13:03.180
 just in case the chairman of my department reads this,

1:13:03.180 --> 1:13:04.260
 I want it to come off well there.

1:13:04.260 --> 1:13:05.740
 Just in case my mom looks at this tweet,

1:13:05.740 --> 1:13:08.220
 I want to make sure she, you know, and so on.

1:13:08.220 --> 1:13:10.260
 So those are all the things that humans are able

1:13:10.260 --> 1:13:12.340
 to sort of throw into the calculation.

1:13:13.260 --> 1:13:14.820
 I mean.

1:13:14.820 --> 1:13:16.540
 What it required, what it requires though,

1:13:16.540 --> 1:13:18.740
 is having a model of your chairman,

1:13:18.740 --> 1:13:19.820
 having a model of your mother,

1:13:19.820 --> 1:13:22.060
 having a model of, you know,

1:13:22.060 --> 1:13:24.500
 the person you want to go on a date with

1:13:24.500 --> 1:13:26.020
 who might look at your tweet and so on.

1:13:26.020 --> 1:13:27.820
 All these things are,

1:13:27.820 --> 1:13:30.980
 you're running models of what it is like to be them.

1:13:30.980 --> 1:13:34.540
 So in terms of the structure of the brain,

1:13:34.540 --> 1:13:37.140
 again, this may be going into speculation land.

1:13:37.140 --> 1:13:39.060
 I hope you go along with me.

1:13:39.060 --> 1:13:39.900
 Yeah, of course.

1:13:39.900 --> 1:13:40.740
 Yep.

1:13:40.740 --> 1:13:45.220
 Is, okay, so the brain seems to be intelligent

1:13:45.220 --> 1:13:48.380
 and our AI systems aren't very currently.

1:13:48.380 --> 1:13:52.860
 So where do you think intelligence arises in the brain?

1:13:52.860 --> 1:13:55.660
 Like what is it about the brain?

1:13:55.660 --> 1:13:58.780
 So if you mean where location wise,

1:13:58.780 --> 1:13:59.900
 it's no single spot.

1:13:59.900 --> 1:14:01.980
 It would be equivalent to asking,

1:14:01.980 --> 1:14:03.500
 I'm looking at New York city,

1:14:04.820 --> 1:14:06.500
 where is the economy?

1:14:06.500 --> 1:14:08.180
 The answer is you can't point to anywhere.

1:14:08.180 --> 1:14:09.980
 The economy is all about the interaction

1:14:09.980 --> 1:14:12.180
 of all of the pieces and parts of the city.

1:14:12.180 --> 1:14:14.140
 And that's what, you know, intelligence,

1:14:14.140 --> 1:14:15.540
 whatever we mean by that in the brain

1:14:15.540 --> 1:14:18.220
 is interacting from everything going on at once.

1:14:18.220 --> 1:14:19.500
 In terms of a structure.

1:14:19.500 --> 1:14:23.620
 So we look humans are much smarter than fish,

1:14:23.620 --> 1:14:26.700
 maybe not dolphins, but dolphins are mammals, right?

1:14:26.700 --> 1:14:28.580
 I assert that what we mean by smarter

1:14:28.580 --> 1:14:30.020
 has to do with live wiring.

1:14:30.020 --> 1:14:32.220
 So what we mean when we say, oh, we're smart

1:14:32.220 --> 1:14:33.700
 is, oh, we can figure out a new thing

1:14:33.700 --> 1:14:36.740
 and figure out a new pathway to get where we need to go.

1:14:36.740 --> 1:14:39.700
 And that's because fish are essentially coming to the table

1:14:39.700 --> 1:14:43.740
 with, you know, okay, here's the hardware, go swim, mate.

1:14:43.740 --> 1:14:46.100
 But we have the capacity to say,

1:14:46.100 --> 1:14:47.580
 okay, look, I'm gonna absorb, oh, oh,

1:14:47.580 --> 1:14:49.260
 but you know, I saw someone else do this thing

1:14:49.260 --> 1:14:51.980
 and I read once that you could do this other thing

1:14:51.980 --> 1:14:52.820
 and so on.

1:14:52.820 --> 1:14:54.620
 So do you think there's, is there something,

1:14:54.620 --> 1:14:56.700
 I know these are mysteries,

1:14:56.700 --> 1:15:00.140
 but like architecturally speaking,

1:15:00.140 --> 1:15:05.140
 what feature of the brain of the live wire aspect of it

1:15:06.100 --> 1:15:08.140
 that is really useful for intelligence?

1:15:08.140 --> 1:15:13.140
 So like, is it the ability of neurons to reconnect?

1:15:15.180 --> 1:15:16.220
 Like, is there something,

1:15:16.220 --> 1:15:18.180
 is there any lessons about the human brain

1:15:18.180 --> 1:15:21.020
 you think might be inspiring for us

1:15:21.020 --> 1:15:26.020
 to take into the artificial, into the machine learning world?

1:15:26.860 --> 1:15:29.620
 Yeah, I'm actually just trying to write some up on this now

1:15:29.620 --> 1:15:31.300
 called, you know, if you wanna build a robot,

1:15:31.300 --> 1:15:32.460
 start with the stomach.

1:15:32.460 --> 1:15:35.380
 And what I mean by that, what I mean by that is

1:15:35.380 --> 1:15:37.220
 a robot has to care, it has to have hunger,

1:15:37.220 --> 1:15:40.340
 it has to care about surviving, that kind of thing.

1:15:40.340 --> 1:15:41.260
 Here's an example.

1:15:41.260 --> 1:15:44.180
 So the penultimate chapter of my book,

1:15:44.180 --> 1:15:46.620
 I titled The Wolf and the Mars Rover.

1:15:46.620 --> 1:15:48.860
 And I just look at this simple comparison

1:15:48.860 --> 1:15:52.580
 of you look at a wolf, it gets its leg caught in a trap.

1:15:52.580 --> 1:15:53.420
 What does it do?

1:15:53.420 --> 1:15:55.460
 It gnaws its leg off,

1:15:55.460 --> 1:15:58.220
 and then it figures out how to walk on three legs.

1:15:58.220 --> 1:15:59.060
 No problem.

1:15:59.060 --> 1:16:02.180
 Now, the Mars Rover Curiosity got its front wheel stuck

1:16:02.180 --> 1:16:05.220
 in some Martian soil, and it died.

1:16:05.220 --> 1:16:09.100
 This project that cost billions of dollars died

1:16:09.100 --> 1:16:09.980
 because it got its wheels.

1:16:09.980 --> 1:16:12.740
 Wouldn't it be terrific if we could build a robot

1:16:12.740 --> 1:16:15.260
 that chewed off its front wheel and figured out

1:16:15.260 --> 1:16:17.780
 how to operate with a slightly different body plan?

1:16:17.780 --> 1:16:21.020
 That's the kind of thing that we wanna be able to build.

1:16:21.020 --> 1:16:23.300
 And to get there, what we need,

1:16:23.300 --> 1:16:25.140
 the whole reason the wolf is able to do that

1:16:25.140 --> 1:16:27.940
 is because its motor and somatosensory systems

1:16:27.940 --> 1:16:28.780
 are live wired.

1:16:28.780 --> 1:16:29.980
 So it says, oh, you know what?

1:16:29.980 --> 1:16:31.620
 Turns out we've got a body plan that's different

1:16:31.620 --> 1:16:34.140
 than what I thought a few minutes ago,

1:16:34.140 --> 1:16:38.820
 but I have a yen to survive and I care about relevance,

1:16:38.820 --> 1:16:40.660
 which in this case is getting to food,

1:16:40.660 --> 1:16:42.580
 getting back to my pack and so on.

1:16:42.580 --> 1:16:44.660
 So I'm just gonna figure out how to operate with this.

1:16:44.660 --> 1:16:46.020
 Oh, whoops, that didn't work.

1:16:46.020 --> 1:16:48.500
 Oh, okay, I'm kind of getting it to work.

1:16:48.500 --> 1:16:49.900
 But the Mars Rover doesn't do that.

1:16:49.900 --> 1:16:51.860
 It just says, oh geez, I was pre programmed.

1:16:51.860 --> 1:16:53.980
 Four wheels, now I have three, I'm screwed.

1:16:53.980 --> 1:16:55.900
 Yeah, you know, I don't know if you're familiar

1:16:55.900 --> 1:16:58.180
 with a philosopher named Ernest Becker.

1:16:58.180 --> 1:17:00.780
 He wrote a book called Denial of Death.

1:17:00.780 --> 1:17:03.500
 And there's a few psychologists, Sheldon Solomon,

1:17:03.500 --> 1:17:06.220
 I think I just spoke with him on his podcast

1:17:07.260 --> 1:17:09.900
 who developed terror management theory,

1:17:09.900 --> 1:17:12.940
 which is like Ernest Becker is a philosopher

1:17:12.940 --> 1:17:17.220
 that basically said that fear of mortality

1:17:17.220 --> 1:17:18.220
 is at the core of it.

1:17:18.220 --> 1:17:19.060
 Yeah.

1:17:19.060 --> 1:17:23.140
 And so I don't know if it sounds compelling as an idea

1:17:23.140 --> 1:17:26.980
 that all of the civilization we've constructed

1:17:26.980 --> 1:17:29.100
 is based on this, but it's.

1:17:29.100 --> 1:17:30.300
 I'm familiar with his work.

1:17:30.300 --> 1:17:31.220
 Here's what I think.

1:17:31.220 --> 1:17:35.180
 I think that yes, fundamentally this desire to survive

1:17:35.180 --> 1:17:37.420
 is at the core of it, I would agree with that.

1:17:37.420 --> 1:17:40.660
 But how that expresses itself in your life

1:17:40.660 --> 1:17:41.700
 ends up being very different.

1:17:41.700 --> 1:17:45.340
 The reason you do what you do is, I mean,

1:17:45.340 --> 1:17:47.900
 you could list the 100 reasons why you chose

1:17:47.900 --> 1:17:49.300
 to write your tweet this way and that way.

1:17:49.300 --> 1:17:51.340
 And it really has nothing to do with the survival part.

1:17:51.340 --> 1:17:53.540
 It has to do with, you know, trying to impress fellow humans

1:17:53.540 --> 1:17:55.260
 and surprise them and say something.

1:17:55.260 --> 1:17:56.940
 Yeah, so many things built on top of each other,

1:17:56.940 --> 1:17:58.820
 but it's fascinating to think

1:17:58.820 --> 1:18:00.900
 that in artificial intelligence systems,

1:18:00.900 --> 1:18:05.420
 we wanna be able to somehow engineer this drive

1:18:05.420 --> 1:18:08.300
 for survival, for immortality.

1:18:08.300 --> 1:18:11.460
 I mean, because as humans, we're not just about survival,

1:18:11.460 --> 1:18:14.740
 we're aware of the fact that we're going to die,

1:18:14.740 --> 1:18:17.420
 which is a very kind of, we're aware of like space time.

1:18:17.420 --> 1:18:18.500
 Most people aren't, by the way.

1:18:18.500 --> 1:18:19.340
 Aren't?

1:18:19.340 --> 1:18:20.340
 Aren't.

1:18:20.340 --> 1:18:25.340
 Confucius said, he said, each person has two lives.

1:18:25.980 --> 1:18:28.060
 The second one begins when you realize

1:18:28.060 --> 1:18:29.500
 that you have just one.

1:18:29.500 --> 1:18:30.340
 Yeah.

1:18:30.340 --> 1:18:31.340
 But most people, it takes a long time

1:18:31.340 --> 1:18:32.700
 for most people to get there.

1:18:32.700 --> 1:18:34.660
 I mean, you could argue this kind of Freudian thing,

1:18:34.660 --> 1:18:41.660
 which Erzbecker argues is they actually figured it out

1:18:41.660 --> 1:18:44.860
 early on and the terror they felt

1:18:44.860 --> 1:18:47.580
 was like the reason it's been suppressed.

1:18:47.580 --> 1:18:49.300
 And the reason most people, when I ask them

1:18:49.300 --> 1:18:50.700
 about whether they're afraid of death,

1:18:50.700 --> 1:18:52.180
 they basically say no.

1:18:53.180 --> 1:18:56.980
 They basically say like, I'm afraid I won't get,

1:18:56.980 --> 1:18:59.820
 like submit the paper before I die.

1:18:59.820 --> 1:19:01.900
 Like they kind of see, they see death

1:19:01.900 --> 1:19:04.780
 as a kind of a inconvenient deadline

1:19:04.780 --> 1:19:08.180
 for a particular set of, like a book you're writing.

1:19:08.180 --> 1:19:10.700
 As opposed to like, what the hell?

1:19:10.700 --> 1:19:14.780
 This thing ends at any moment.

1:19:14.780 --> 1:19:17.260
 Like most people, as I've encountered,

1:19:17.260 --> 1:19:20.700
 do not meditate on the idea that like right now

1:19:20.700 --> 1:19:21.740
 you could die.

1:19:21.740 --> 1:19:26.380
 Like right now, like in the next five minutes,

1:19:26.380 --> 1:19:29.940
 it could be all over and, you know, meditate on that idea.

1:19:29.940 --> 1:19:32.580
 I think that somehow brings you closer

1:19:32.580 --> 1:19:36.500
 to like the core of the motivations

1:19:36.500 --> 1:19:40.140
 and the core of the human cognition condition.

1:19:40.140 --> 1:19:41.300
 I think it might be the core, but like I said,

1:19:41.300 --> 1:19:43.820
 it is not what drives us day to day.

1:19:43.820 --> 1:19:45.540
 Yeah, there's so many things on top of it,

1:19:45.540 --> 1:19:46.380
 but it is interesting.

1:19:46.380 --> 1:19:48.780
 I mean, as the ancient poet said,

1:19:49.660 --> 1:19:53.340
 death whispers at my ear, live for I come.

1:19:53.340 --> 1:19:56.100
 So it's, it is certainly motivating

1:19:56.100 --> 1:19:58.060
 when we think about that.

1:19:58.060 --> 1:19:59.220
 Okay, I've got some deadline.

1:19:59.220 --> 1:20:00.340
 I don't know exactly when it is,

1:20:00.340 --> 1:20:02.180
 but I better make stuff happen.

1:20:02.180 --> 1:20:04.300
 It is motivating, but I don't think,

1:20:04.300 --> 1:20:06.780
 I mean, I know for just speaking for me personally,

1:20:06.780 --> 1:20:08.900
 that's not what motivates me day to day.

1:20:08.900 --> 1:20:13.380
 It's instead, oh, I want to get this, you know,

1:20:13.380 --> 1:20:14.780
 program up and running before this,

1:20:14.780 --> 1:20:17.300
 or I want to make sure my coauthor isn't mad at me

1:20:17.300 --> 1:20:18.220
 because I haven't gotten this in,

1:20:18.220 --> 1:20:19.580
 or I don't want to miss this grant deadline,

1:20:19.580 --> 1:20:21.180
 or, you know, whatever the thing is.

1:20:21.180 --> 1:20:24.060
 Yeah, it's too distant in a sense.

1:20:24.060 --> 1:20:26.540
 Nevertheless, it is good to reconnect.

1:20:26.540 --> 1:20:30.220
 But for the AI systems, none of that is there.

1:20:31.220 --> 1:20:33.860
 Like a neural network does not fear its mortality.

1:20:34.940 --> 1:20:37.180
 And that seems to be somehow

1:20:37.180 --> 1:20:39.660
 fundamentally missing the point.

1:20:39.660 --> 1:20:40.700
 I think that's missing the point,

1:20:40.700 --> 1:20:42.420
 but I wonder, it's an interesting speculation

1:20:42.420 --> 1:20:43.700
 about whether you can build an AI system

1:20:43.700 --> 1:20:45.780
 that is much closer to being a human

1:20:45.780 --> 1:20:48.380
 without the mortality and survival piece,

1:20:48.380 --> 1:20:51.140
 but just the thing of relevance,

1:20:51.140 --> 1:20:52.740
 just I care about this versus that.

1:20:52.740 --> 1:20:54.780
 Right now, if you have a robot roll into the room,

1:20:54.780 --> 1:20:55.660
 it's going to be frozen

1:20:55.660 --> 1:20:57.700
 because it doesn't have any reason to go there versus there.

1:20:57.700 --> 1:21:02.580
 It doesn't have any particular set of things

1:21:02.580 --> 1:21:05.620
 about this is how I should navigate my next move

1:21:05.620 --> 1:21:07.700
 because I want something.

1:21:07.700 --> 1:21:10.900
 Yeah, the thing about humans

1:21:10.900 --> 1:21:13.740
 is they seem to generate goals.

1:21:13.740 --> 1:21:15.740
 They're like, you said livewired.

1:21:15.740 --> 1:21:19.980
 I mean, it's very flexible in terms of the goals

1:21:19.980 --> 1:21:21.780
 and creative in terms of the goals we generate

1:21:21.780 --> 1:21:23.700
 when we enter a room.

1:21:23.700 --> 1:21:25.540
 You show up to a party without a goal,

1:21:25.540 --> 1:21:27.900
 usually, and then you figure it out along the way.

1:21:27.900 --> 1:21:29.980
 Yes, but this goes back to the question about free will,

1:21:29.980 --> 1:21:31.940
 which is when I walk into the party,

1:21:33.340 --> 1:21:35.620
 if you rewound it 10,000 times,

1:21:35.620 --> 1:21:37.980
 would I go and talk to that couple over there

1:21:37.980 --> 1:21:38.980
 versus that person?

1:21:38.980 --> 1:21:41.700
 Like, I might do this exact same thing every time

1:21:41.700 --> 1:21:44.380
 because I've got some goal stack and I think,

1:21:44.380 --> 1:21:45.820
 okay, well, at this party,

1:21:45.820 --> 1:21:47.700
 I really want to meet these kind of people

1:21:47.700 --> 1:21:51.340
 or I feel awkward or whatever my goals are.

1:21:51.340 --> 1:21:52.620
 By the way, so there was something

1:21:52.620 --> 1:21:54.580
 that I meant to mention earlier.

1:21:54.580 --> 1:21:56.140
 If you don't mind going back,

1:21:56.140 --> 1:21:58.340
 which is this, when we were talking about BCI.

1:21:59.380 --> 1:22:00.260
 So I don't know if you know this,

1:22:00.260 --> 1:22:02.620
 but what I'm spending 90% of my time doing now

1:22:02.620 --> 1:22:03.820
 is running a company.

1:22:03.820 --> 1:22:04.660
 Do you know about this?

1:22:04.660 --> 1:22:08.100
 Yes, I wasn't sure what the company is involved in.

1:22:08.100 --> 1:22:09.420
 Right, so. Can you talk about it?

1:22:09.420 --> 1:22:10.820
 Yeah, yeah.

1:22:10.820 --> 1:22:13.020
 So when it comes to the future of BCI,

1:22:15.020 --> 1:22:18.860
 you can put stuff into the brain invasively,

1:22:18.860 --> 1:22:22.060
 but my interest has been how you can get data streams

1:22:22.060 --> 1:22:24.180
 into the brain noninvasively.

1:22:24.180 --> 1:22:26.340
 So I run a company called Neosensory

1:22:26.340 --> 1:22:29.620
 and what we build is this little wristband.

1:22:29.620 --> 1:22:30.580
 We've built this in many different form factors.

1:22:30.580 --> 1:22:31.940
 Oh, wow, that's it?

1:22:31.940 --> 1:22:32.780
 Yeah, this is it.

1:22:32.780 --> 1:22:35.420
 And it's got these vibratory motors in it.

1:22:35.420 --> 1:22:38.220
 So these things, as I'm speaking, for example,

1:22:38.220 --> 1:22:41.060
 it's capturing my voice and running algorithms

1:22:41.060 --> 1:22:44.460
 and then turning that into patterns of vibration here.

1:22:44.460 --> 1:22:48.740
 So people who are deaf, for example,

1:22:48.740 --> 1:22:50.780
 learn to hear through their skin.

1:22:50.780 --> 1:22:54.260
 So the information is getting up to their brain this way

1:22:54.260 --> 1:22:55.820
 and they learn how to hear.

1:22:55.820 --> 1:22:58.020
 So it turns out on day one, people are pretty good,

1:22:58.020 --> 1:23:00.580
 like better than you'd expect at being able to say,

1:23:00.580 --> 1:23:02.540
 oh, that's weird, was that a dog barking?

1:23:02.540 --> 1:23:03.380
 Was that a baby crying?

1:23:03.380 --> 1:23:04.740
 Was that a door knock, a doorbell?

1:23:04.740 --> 1:23:06.500
 Like people are pretty good at it,

1:23:06.500 --> 1:23:09.260
 but with time they get better and better

1:23:09.260 --> 1:23:12.380
 and what it becomes is a new qualia.

1:23:12.380 --> 1:23:15.380
 In other words, a new subjective internal experience.

1:23:15.380 --> 1:23:18.380
 So on day one, they say, whoa, what was that?

1:23:18.380 --> 1:23:20.620
 Oh, oh, that was the dog barking.

1:23:20.620 --> 1:23:23.420
 But by three months later, they say,

1:23:23.420 --> 1:23:24.540
 oh, there's a dog barking somewhere.

1:23:24.540 --> 1:23:25.540
 Oh, there's the dog.

1:23:25.540 --> 1:23:26.380
 That's fascinating.

1:23:26.380 --> 1:23:27.700
 And by the way, that's exactly how you learn

1:23:27.700 --> 1:23:29.380
 how to use your ears.

1:23:29.380 --> 1:23:30.540
 So of course you don't remember this,

1:23:30.540 --> 1:23:33.100
 but when you were an infant, all you have are

1:23:33.100 --> 1:23:36.540
 your eardrum vibrating causes spikes to go down,

1:23:36.540 --> 1:23:39.940
 your auditory nerves and impinging your auditory cortex.

1:23:40.940 --> 1:23:43.060
 Your brain doesn't know what those mean automatically,

1:23:43.060 --> 1:23:44.820
 but what happens is you learn how to hear

1:23:44.820 --> 1:23:46.420
 by looking for correlations.

1:23:46.420 --> 1:23:48.900
 You clap your hands as a baby,

1:23:48.900 --> 1:23:50.860
 you look at your mother's mouth moving

1:23:50.860 --> 1:23:53.180
 and that correlates with what's going on there.

1:23:53.180 --> 1:23:54.860
 And eventually your brain says, all right,

1:23:54.860 --> 1:23:57.940
 I'm just gonna summarize this as an internal experience,

1:23:57.940 --> 1:23:59.300
 as a conscious experience.

1:23:59.300 --> 1:24:01.260
 And that's exactly what happens here.

1:24:01.260 --> 1:24:04.140
 The weird part is that you can feed data into the brain,

1:24:04.140 --> 1:24:06.260
 not through the ears, but through any channel

1:24:06.260 --> 1:24:07.180
 that gets there.

1:24:07.180 --> 1:24:08.500
 As long as the information gets there,

1:24:08.500 --> 1:24:10.260
 your brain figures out what to do with it.

1:24:10.260 --> 1:24:11.340
 That's fascinating.

1:24:11.340 --> 1:24:14.740
 Like expanding the set of sensors,

1:24:14.740 --> 1:24:19.060
 it could be arbitrarily, yeah,

1:24:19.060 --> 1:24:21.220
 it could expand arbitrarily, which is fascinating.

1:24:21.220 --> 1:24:22.060
 Well, exactly.

1:24:22.060 --> 1:24:24.500
 And by the way, the reason I use this skin,

1:24:24.500 --> 1:24:26.300
 there's all kinds of cool stuff going on

1:24:26.300 --> 1:24:28.140
 in the AR world with glasses.

1:24:28.140 --> 1:24:29.940
 But the fact is your eyes are overtaxed

1:24:29.940 --> 1:24:30.900
 and your ears are overtaxed

1:24:30.900 --> 1:24:33.420
 and you need to be able to see and hear other stuff.

1:24:33.420 --> 1:24:34.660
 But you're covered with the skin,

1:24:34.660 --> 1:24:38.140
 which is this incredible computational material

1:24:38.140 --> 1:24:39.700
 with which you can feed information.

1:24:39.700 --> 1:24:42.540
 And we don't use our skin for much of anything nowadays.

1:24:42.540 --> 1:24:44.260
 My joke in the lab is that I say,

1:24:44.260 --> 1:24:45.820
 we don't call this the waste for nothing.

1:24:45.820 --> 1:24:47.380
 Because originally we built this as the vest

1:24:47.380 --> 1:24:51.020
 and you're passing in all this information that way.

1:24:51.020 --> 1:24:56.020
 And what I'm doing here with the deaf community

1:24:56.380 --> 1:24:59.020
 is what's called sensory substitution,

1:24:59.020 --> 1:25:02.420
 where I'm capturing sound and I'm just replacing the ears

1:25:02.420 --> 1:25:04.340
 with the skin and that works.

1:25:05.900 --> 1:25:07.140
 One of the things I talk about LiveWire

1:25:07.140 --> 1:25:09.500
 is sensory expansion.

1:25:09.500 --> 1:25:11.980
 So what if you took something like your visual system,

1:25:11.980 --> 1:25:13.500
 which picks up on a very thin slice

1:25:13.500 --> 1:25:15.300
 of the electromagnetic spectrum,

1:25:15.300 --> 1:25:18.460
 and you could see infrared or ultraviolet.

1:25:18.460 --> 1:25:21.100
 So we've hooked that up, infrared and ultraviolet detectors,

1:25:21.100 --> 1:25:22.780
 and I can feel what's going on.

1:25:22.780 --> 1:25:25.220
 So just as an example, the first night I built the infrared,

1:25:25.220 --> 1:25:27.460
 one of my engineers built it, the infrared detector,

1:25:27.460 --> 1:25:29.420
 I was walking in the dark between two houses

1:25:29.420 --> 1:25:31.780
 and suddenly I felt all this infrared radiation.

1:25:31.780 --> 1:25:32.860
 I was like, where's that come from?

1:25:32.860 --> 1:25:35.900
 And I just followed my wrist and I found an infrared camera,

1:25:35.900 --> 1:25:37.780
 a night vision camera that was,

1:25:37.780 --> 1:25:40.420
 but I immediately, oh, there's that thing there.

1:25:40.420 --> 1:25:42.060
 Of course, I would have never seen it,

1:25:42.060 --> 1:25:45.260
 but now it's just part of my reality.

1:25:45.260 --> 1:25:46.100
 That's fascinating.

1:25:46.100 --> 1:25:46.940
 Yeah, and then of course,

1:25:46.940 --> 1:25:49.860
 what I'm really interested in is sensory addition.

1:25:49.860 --> 1:25:51.620
 What if you could pick up on stuff

1:25:51.620 --> 1:25:55.060
 that isn't even part of what we normally pick up on,

1:25:55.060 --> 1:25:57.620
 like the magnetic field of the earth

1:25:57.620 --> 1:26:00.660
 or Twitter or stock market or things like that.

1:26:00.660 --> 1:26:02.300
 Or the, I don't know, some weird stuff

1:26:02.300 --> 1:26:04.260
 like the moods of other people or something like that.

1:26:04.260 --> 1:26:06.540
 Sure, now what you need is a way to measure this.

1:26:06.540 --> 1:26:08.180
 So as long as there's a machine that can measure it,

1:26:08.180 --> 1:26:09.980
 it's easy, it's trivial to feed this in here

1:26:09.980 --> 1:26:14.300
 and you come to be, it comes to be part of your reality.

1:26:14.300 --> 1:26:16.220
 It's like you have another sensor.

1:26:16.220 --> 1:26:19.140
 And that kind of thing is without doing like,

1:26:19.140 --> 1:26:20.860
 if you look in Neuralink,

1:26:20.860 --> 1:26:23.700
 I forgot how you put it, but it was eloquent,

1:26:23.700 --> 1:26:26.140
 without getting, cutting into the brain, basically.

1:26:26.140 --> 1:26:27.300
 Yeah, exactly, exactly.

1:26:27.300 --> 1:26:30.660
 So this costs, at the moment, $399.

1:26:30.660 --> 1:26:32.060
 That's not gonna kill you.

1:26:32.060 --> 1:26:33.380
 Yeah, it's not gonna kill you.

1:26:33.380 --> 1:26:36.540
 You just put it on and when you're done, you take it off.

1:26:36.540 --> 1:26:39.180
 Yeah, and so, and the name of the company, by the way,

1:26:39.180 --> 1:26:42.700
 is Neosensory for new senses, because the whole idea is.

1:26:42.700 --> 1:26:43.540
 Beautiful, that's.

1:26:43.540 --> 1:26:45.940
 You can, as I said, you come to the table

1:26:45.940 --> 1:26:48.060
 with certain plug and play devices and then that's it.

1:26:48.060 --> 1:26:49.140
 Like I can pick up on this little bit

1:26:49.140 --> 1:26:50.180
 of the electromagnetic radiation,

1:26:50.180 --> 1:26:53.420
 you can pick up on this little frequency band

1:26:53.420 --> 1:26:56.220
 for hearing and so on, but I'm stuck there

1:26:56.220 --> 1:26:57.820
 and there's no reason we have to be stuck there.

1:26:57.820 --> 1:27:01.740
 We can expand our umwelt by adding new senses, yeah.

1:27:01.740 --> 1:27:02.660
 What's umwelt?

1:27:02.660 --> 1:27:05.740
 Oh, I'm sorry, the umwelt is the slice of reality

1:27:05.740 --> 1:27:06.580
 that you pick up on.

1:27:06.580 --> 1:27:09.420
 So each animal has its own umwelt.

1:27:09.420 --> 1:27:10.780
 Yeah, exactly.

1:27:10.780 --> 1:27:11.620
 Nice.

1:27:11.620 --> 1:27:12.460
 I'm sorry, I forgot to define it before.

1:27:12.460 --> 1:27:15.660
 It's such an important concept, which is to say,

1:27:17.340 --> 1:27:19.780
 for example, if you are a tick,

1:27:19.780 --> 1:27:22.820
 you pick up on butyric gas, you pick up on odor

1:27:22.820 --> 1:27:24.100
 and you pick up on temperature, that's it.

1:27:24.100 --> 1:27:25.740
 That's how you construct your reality

1:27:25.740 --> 1:27:26.860
 is with those two sensors.

1:27:26.860 --> 1:27:28.820
 If you are a blind echolocating bat,

1:27:28.820 --> 1:27:31.500
 you're picking up on air compression waves coming back,

1:27:31.500 --> 1:27:32.540
 you know, echolocation.

1:27:32.540 --> 1:27:34.820
 If you are the black ghost knife fish,

1:27:34.820 --> 1:27:37.980
 you're picking up on changes in the electrical field

1:27:37.980 --> 1:27:40.420
 around you with electroreception.

1:27:40.420 --> 1:27:41.380
 That's how they swim around

1:27:41.380 --> 1:27:43.020
 and tell there's a rock there and so on.

1:27:43.020 --> 1:27:45.060
 But that's all they pick up on.

1:27:45.060 --> 1:27:47.020
 That's their umwelt.

1:27:47.020 --> 1:27:49.820
 That's the signals they get from the world

1:27:49.820 --> 1:27:51.300
 from which to construct their reality.

1:27:51.300 --> 1:27:53.540
 And they can be totally different umwelts.

1:27:53.540 --> 1:27:54.380
 That's fantastic.

1:27:54.380 --> 1:27:57.460
 And so our human umwelt is, you know,

1:27:57.460 --> 1:27:59.380
 we've got little bits that we can pick up on.

1:27:59.380 --> 1:28:01.100
 One of the things I like to do with my students

1:28:01.100 --> 1:28:05.780
 is talk about, imagine that you are a bloodhound dog, right?

1:28:05.780 --> 1:28:07.500
 You are a bloodhound dog with a huge snout

1:28:07.500 --> 1:28:09.380
 with 200 million scent receptors in it.

1:28:09.380 --> 1:28:11.260
 And your whole world is about smelling.

1:28:11.260 --> 1:28:13.740
 You know, you've got slits in your nostrils,

1:28:13.740 --> 1:28:15.300
 like big nose fulls of air and so on.

1:28:15.300 --> 1:28:16.460
 Do you have a dog?

1:28:16.460 --> 1:28:17.300
 Nope, used to.

1:28:17.300 --> 1:28:18.140
 Used to, okay, right.

1:28:18.140 --> 1:28:19.340
 So you know, you walk your dog around

1:28:19.340 --> 1:28:21.020
 and your dog is smelling everything.

1:28:21.020 --> 1:28:22.260
 The whole world is full of signals

1:28:22.260 --> 1:28:23.820
 that you do not pick up on.

1:28:23.820 --> 1:28:25.380
 And so imagine if you were that dog

1:28:25.380 --> 1:28:26.940
 and you looked at your human master and thought,

1:28:26.940 --> 1:28:28.100
 my God, what is it like to have

1:28:28.100 --> 1:28:30.420
 the pitiful little nose of a human?

1:28:30.420 --> 1:28:32.740
 How could you not know that there's a cat 100 yards away

1:28:32.740 --> 1:28:34.500
 or that your friend was here six hours ago?

1:28:34.500 --> 1:28:37.980
 And so the idea is because we're stuck in our own belt,

1:28:37.980 --> 1:28:39.180
 because we have this little pitiful noses,

1:28:39.180 --> 1:28:41.500
 we think, okay, well, yeah, we're seeing reality,

1:28:41.500 --> 1:28:44.540
 but you can have very different sorts of realities

1:28:44.540 --> 1:28:46.940
 depending on the peripheral plug and play devices

1:28:46.940 --> 1:28:47.780
 you're equipped with.

1:28:47.780 --> 1:28:49.660
 It's fascinating to think that like,

1:28:49.660 --> 1:28:52.100
 if we're being honest, probably our own belt

1:28:52.100 --> 1:28:57.340
 is, you know, some infinitely tiny percent

1:28:57.340 --> 1:29:01.420
 of the possibilities of how you can sense,

1:29:01.420 --> 1:29:04.380
 quote unquote, reality, even if you could,

1:29:04.380 --> 1:29:08.780
 I mean, there's a guy named Donald Hoffman, yeah,

1:29:08.780 --> 1:29:13.780
 who basically says we're really far away from reality

1:29:13.860 --> 1:29:15.980
 in terms of our ability to sense anything.

1:29:15.980 --> 1:29:20.700
 Like we're very, we're almost like we're floating out there

1:29:20.700 --> 1:29:22.420
 that's almost like completely attached

1:29:22.420 --> 1:29:24.220
 to the actual physical reality.

1:29:24.220 --> 1:29:27.060
 It's fascinating that we can have extra senses

1:29:27.060 --> 1:29:29.660
 that could help us get a little bit closer.

1:29:29.660 --> 1:29:33.340
 Exactly, and by the way, this has been the fruits

1:29:33.340 --> 1:29:36.100
 of science is realizing, like, for example,

1:29:36.100 --> 1:29:36.940
 you know, you open your eyes

1:29:36.940 --> 1:29:38.220
 and there's the world around you, right?

1:29:38.220 --> 1:29:40.100
 But of course, depending on how you calculate it,

1:29:40.100 --> 1:29:42.900
 it's less than a 10 trillionth of the electromagnetic

1:29:42.900 --> 1:29:45.780
 spectrum that we call visible light.

1:29:45.780 --> 1:29:46.620
 The reason I say it depends,

1:29:46.620 --> 1:29:47.820
 because, you know, it's actually infinite

1:29:47.820 --> 1:29:49.220
 in all directions presumably.

1:29:49.220 --> 1:29:51.260
 Yeah, and so that's exactly that.

1:29:51.260 --> 1:29:53.620
 And then science allows you to actually look

1:29:53.620 --> 1:29:54.980
 into the rest of it.

1:29:54.980 --> 1:29:57.140
 Exactly, so understanding how big the world is out there.

1:29:57.140 --> 1:29:59.060
 And the same with the world of really small

1:29:59.060 --> 1:30:00.460
 and the world of really large.

1:30:00.460 --> 1:30:01.300
 Exactly.

1:30:01.300 --> 1:30:03.100
 That's beyond our ability to sense.

1:30:03.100 --> 1:30:04.980
 Exactly, and so the reason I think this kind of thing

1:30:04.980 --> 1:30:07.740
 matters is because we now have an opportunity

1:30:07.740 --> 1:30:10.900
 for the first time in human history to say,

1:30:10.900 --> 1:30:13.060
 okay, well, I'm just gonna include other things

1:30:13.060 --> 1:30:13.900
 in my own belt.

1:30:13.900 --> 1:30:15.700
 So I'm gonna include infrared radiation

1:30:15.700 --> 1:30:19.020
 and have a direct perceptual experience of that.

1:30:19.020 --> 1:30:21.340
 And so I'm very, you know, I mean,

1:30:21.340 --> 1:30:22.660
 so, you know, I've given up my lab

1:30:22.660 --> 1:30:25.340
 and I run this company 90% of my time now.

1:30:25.340 --> 1:30:26.180
 That's what I'm doing.

1:30:26.180 --> 1:30:27.740
 I still teach at Stanford and I'm, you know,

1:30:27.740 --> 1:30:29.660
 teaching courses and stuff like that.

1:30:29.660 --> 1:30:32.980
 But this is like, this is your passion.

1:30:32.980 --> 1:30:35.020
 The fire is on this.

1:30:35.020 --> 1:30:37.420
 Yeah, I feel like this is the most important thing

1:30:37.420 --> 1:30:38.820
 that's happening right now.

1:30:38.820 --> 1:30:40.100
 I mean, obviously I think that,

1:30:40.100 --> 1:30:42.300
 because that's what I'm devoting my time in my life to.

1:30:42.300 --> 1:30:45.100
 But I mean, it's a brilliant set of ideas.

1:30:45.100 --> 1:30:50.100
 It certainly is like, it's a step in a very vibrant future,

1:30:50.100 --> 1:30:50.940
 I would say.

1:30:50.940 --> 1:30:54.180
 Like the possibilities there are endless.

1:30:54.180 --> 1:30:55.020
 Exactly.

1:30:55.020 --> 1:30:57.220
 So if you ask what I think about Neuralink,

1:30:57.220 --> 1:30:59.260
 I think it's amazing what those guys are doing

1:30:59.260 --> 1:31:00.100
 and working on,

1:31:00.100 --> 1:31:02.820
 but I think it's not practical for almost everybody.

1:31:02.820 --> 1:31:05.700
 For example, for people who are deaf, they buy this

1:31:05.700 --> 1:31:08.420
 and, you know, every day we're getting tons of emails

1:31:08.420 --> 1:31:09.980
 and tweets and whatever from people saying, wow,

1:31:09.980 --> 1:31:12.500
 I picked up on this and then I had no idea that was a,

1:31:12.500 --> 1:31:14.700
 I didn't even know that was happening out there.

1:31:14.700 --> 1:31:16.820
 And they're coming to hear, by the way,

1:31:16.820 --> 1:31:18.700
 this is, you know, less than a 10 year old,

1:31:18.700 --> 1:31:20.860
 by the way, this is less than a 10th of the price

1:31:20.860 --> 1:31:23.340
 of a hearing aid and like 250 times less

1:31:23.340 --> 1:31:25.220
 than a cochlear implant.

1:31:25.220 --> 1:31:26.060
 That's amazing.

1:31:27.100 --> 1:31:30.660
 People love hearing about what, you know,

1:31:30.660 --> 1:31:33.900
 brilliant folks like yourself could recommend

1:31:33.900 --> 1:31:35.020
 in terms of books.

1:31:35.020 --> 1:31:36.980
 Of course, you're an author of many books.

1:31:36.980 --> 1:31:38.780
 So I'll, in the introduction,

1:31:38.780 --> 1:31:40.300
 mention all the books you've written.

1:31:40.300 --> 1:31:42.500
 People should definitely read LiveWired.

1:31:42.500 --> 1:31:44.820
 I've gotten a chance to read some of it and it's amazing.

1:31:44.820 --> 1:31:48.300
 But is there three books, technical, fiction,

1:31:48.300 --> 1:31:52.100
 philosophical that had an impact on you

1:31:52.100 --> 1:31:56.380
 when you were younger or today and books,

1:31:56.380 --> 1:31:59.580
 perhaps some of which you would want to recommend

1:31:59.580 --> 1:32:00.500
 that others read?

1:32:01.380 --> 1:32:02.460
 You know, as an undergraduate,

1:32:02.460 --> 1:32:04.140
 I majored in British and American literature.

1:32:04.140 --> 1:32:06.780
 That was my major because I love literature.

1:32:06.780 --> 1:32:08.660
 I grew up with literature.

1:32:08.660 --> 1:32:10.500
 My father had these extensive bookshelves.

1:32:10.500 --> 1:32:13.860
 And so I grew up in the mountains in New Mexico.

1:32:13.860 --> 1:32:16.100
 And so that was mostly why I spent my time was reading books.

1:32:16.100 --> 1:32:21.100
 But, you know, I love, you know, Faulkner, Hemingway.

1:32:23.660 --> 1:32:26.100
 I love many South American authors,

1:32:26.100 --> 1:32:28.220
 Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Italo Calvino.

1:32:28.220 --> 1:32:29.860
 I would actually recommend Invisible Cities.

1:32:29.860 --> 1:32:33.140
 I just, I loved that book by Italo Calvino.

1:32:33.140 --> 1:32:34.660
 Sorry, it's a book of fiction.

1:32:37.020 --> 1:32:39.100
 Anthony Dorr wrote a book called

1:32:39.100 --> 1:32:41.020
 All the Light We Cannot See,

1:32:41.020 --> 1:32:44.140
 which actually was inspired by incognito,

1:32:44.140 --> 1:32:45.940
 by exactly what we were talking about earlier

1:32:45.940 --> 1:32:48.740
 about how you can only see a little bit of the,

1:32:48.740 --> 1:32:51.460
 what we call visible light in the electromagnetic radiation.

1:32:51.460 --> 1:32:52.780
 I wrote about this in incognito,

1:32:52.780 --> 1:32:54.780
 and then he reviewed incognito for the Washington Post.

1:32:54.780 --> 1:32:56.020
 Oh no, that's awesome.

1:32:56.020 --> 1:32:57.580
 And then he wrote this book called,

1:32:57.580 --> 1:32:58.700
 the book has nothing to do with that,

1:32:58.700 --> 1:33:00.860
 but that's where the title comes from.

1:33:00.860 --> 1:33:01.700
 All the Light We Cannot See

1:33:01.700 --> 1:33:02.940
 is about the rest of the spectrum.

1:33:02.940 --> 1:33:07.940
 But the, that's an absolutely gorgeous book.

1:33:08.340 --> 1:33:09.420
 That's a book of fiction.

1:33:09.420 --> 1:33:10.500
 Yeah, it's a book of fiction.

1:33:10.500 --> 1:33:12.620
 What's it about?

1:33:12.620 --> 1:33:14.340
 It takes place during World War II

1:33:14.340 --> 1:33:15.420
 about these two young people,

1:33:15.420 --> 1:33:18.260
 one of whom is blind and yeah.

1:33:18.260 --> 1:33:19.820
 Anything else?

1:33:19.820 --> 1:33:21.940
 So what, any, so you mentioned Hemingway?

1:33:21.940 --> 1:33:22.780
 I mean.

1:33:22.780 --> 1:33:26.500
 Old Man and the Sea, what's your favorite?

1:33:27.860 --> 1:33:29.380
 Snow's a Kilimanjaro.

1:33:29.380 --> 1:33:30.220
 Oh wow, okay.

1:33:30.220 --> 1:33:31.660
 It's a collection of short stories that I love.

1:33:31.660 --> 1:33:33.300
 As far as nonfiction goes,

1:33:33.300 --> 1:33:35.780
 I grew up with Cosmos,

1:33:35.780 --> 1:33:38.180
 both watching the PBS series and then reading the book,

1:33:38.180 --> 1:33:41.260
 and that influenced me a huge amount in terms of what I do.

1:33:41.260 --> 1:33:42.980
 I, from the time I was a kid,

1:33:42.980 --> 1:33:44.940
 I felt like I want to be Carl Sagan.

1:33:44.940 --> 1:33:46.140
 Like, I just, that's what I loved.

1:33:46.140 --> 1:33:47.940
 And in the end, I just, you know,

1:33:47.940 --> 1:33:50.980
 I studied space physics for a while as an undergrad,

1:33:50.980 --> 1:33:53.560
 but then I, in my last semester,

1:33:53.560 --> 1:33:55.460
 discovered neuroscience last semester,

1:33:55.460 --> 1:33:57.540
 and I just thought, wow, I'm hooked on that.

1:33:57.540 --> 1:33:59.580
 So the Carl Sagan of the brain.

1:34:01.420 --> 1:34:02.260
 That was my aspiration.

1:34:02.260 --> 1:34:03.700
 Is the aspiration.

1:34:03.700 --> 1:34:07.900
 I mean, you're doing an incredible job of it.

1:34:07.900 --> 1:34:11.900
 So you open the book live wide with a quote by Heidegger.

1:34:11.900 --> 1:34:15.540
 Every man is born as many men and dies as a single one.

1:34:17.700 --> 1:34:20.020
 Well, what do you mean, or what?

1:34:20.020 --> 1:34:21.620
 I'll tell you what I meant by it.

1:34:21.620 --> 1:34:23.740
 So he had his own reason why he was writing that,

1:34:23.740 --> 1:34:25.740
 but I meant this in terms of brain plasticity,

1:34:25.740 --> 1:34:26.860
 in terms of the library,

1:34:26.860 --> 1:34:28.500
 which is this issue that I mentioned before

1:34:28.500 --> 1:34:29.900
 about this, you know, this cone,

1:34:29.900 --> 1:34:31.780
 the space time cone that we are in,

1:34:31.780 --> 1:34:35.740
 which is that when you dropped into the world,

1:34:35.740 --> 1:34:37.900
 you, Lex, had all this different potential.

1:34:37.900 --> 1:34:40.400
 You could have been a great surfer

1:34:40.400 --> 1:34:42.260
 or a great chess player or a,

1:34:42.260 --> 1:34:45.460
 you could have been thousands of different men

1:34:45.460 --> 1:34:46.460
 when you grew up,

1:34:46.460 --> 1:34:49.300
 but what you did is things that were not your choice

1:34:49.300 --> 1:34:50.620
 and your choice along the way.

1:34:50.620 --> 1:34:52.760
 You know, you ended up navigating a particular path

1:34:52.760 --> 1:34:54.140
 and now you're exactly who you are.

1:34:54.140 --> 1:34:55.300
 You used to have lots of potential,

1:34:55.300 --> 1:34:59.100
 but the day you die, you will be exactly Lex.

1:34:59.100 --> 1:35:01.580
 You will be that one person, yeah.

1:35:01.580 --> 1:35:03.580
 So on that, in that context,

1:35:03.580 --> 1:35:06.580
 I mean, first of all, it's just a beautiful,

1:35:06.580 --> 1:35:09.940
 it's a humbling picture, but it's a beautiful one

1:35:09.940 --> 1:35:12.700
 because it's all the possible trajectories

1:35:12.700 --> 1:35:14.540
 and you pick one and you walk down that road

1:35:14.540 --> 1:35:16.260
 and it's the Robert Frost poem.

1:35:16.260 --> 1:35:18.860
 But on that topic, let me ask the biggest

1:35:18.860 --> 1:35:20.500
 and the most ridiculous question.

1:35:21.380 --> 1:35:23.300
 So in this live, wide brain,

1:35:23.300 --> 1:35:25.100
 when we choose all these different trajectories

1:35:25.100 --> 1:35:27.940
 and end up with one, what's the meaning of it all?

1:35:27.940 --> 1:35:32.180
 What's, is there a why here?

1:35:32.180 --> 1:35:34.100
 What's the meaning of life?

1:35:34.100 --> 1:35:34.940
 Yeah.

1:35:34.940 --> 1:35:36.380
 David Engelman.

1:35:36.380 --> 1:35:37.220
 That's it.

1:35:37.220 --> 1:35:42.220
 I mean, this is the question that everyone has attacked

1:35:42.940 --> 1:35:45.300
 from their own life or point of view,

1:35:45.300 --> 1:35:47.300
 by which I mean, culturally,

1:35:47.300 --> 1:35:49.180
 if you grew up in a religious society,

1:35:49.180 --> 1:35:51.100
 you have one way of attacking that question.

1:35:51.100 --> 1:35:53.300
 So if you grew up in a secular or scientific society,

1:35:53.300 --> 1:35:55.460
 you have a different way of attacking that question.

1:35:55.460 --> 1:35:59.660
 Obviously, I don't know, I abstain on that question.

1:35:59.660 --> 1:36:00.860
 Yeah.

1:36:00.860 --> 1:36:03.340
 I mean, I think one of the fundamental things,

1:36:03.340 --> 1:36:06.260
 I guess, in that, in all those possible trajectories

1:36:06.260 --> 1:36:09.260
 is you're always asking.

1:36:09.260 --> 1:36:11.540
 I mean, that's the act of asking

1:36:11.540 --> 1:36:14.220
 what the heck is this thing for,

1:36:14.220 --> 1:36:18.460
 is equivalent to, or at least runs in parallel

1:36:18.460 --> 1:36:20.860
 to all the choices that you're making.

1:36:20.860 --> 1:36:23.700
 Cause it's kind of, that's the underlying question.

1:36:23.700 --> 1:36:24.540
 Well, that's right.

1:36:24.540 --> 1:36:25.500
 And by the way, you know,

1:36:25.500 --> 1:36:27.820
 this is the interesting thing about human psychology.

1:36:27.820 --> 1:36:29.460
 You know, we've got all these layers of things

1:36:29.460 --> 1:36:30.900
 at which we can ask questions.

1:36:30.900 --> 1:36:33.740
 And so if you keep asking yourself the question about,

1:36:33.740 --> 1:36:36.500
 what is the optimal way for me to be spending my time?

1:36:36.500 --> 1:36:37.340
 What should I be doing?

1:36:37.340 --> 1:36:39.060
 What charity should I get involved with and so on?

1:36:39.060 --> 1:36:41.340
 If you're asking those big questions

1:36:42.500 --> 1:36:44.740
 that steers you appropriately,

1:36:44.740 --> 1:36:46.540
 if you're the type of person who never asks,

1:36:46.540 --> 1:36:48.900
 hey, is there something better I can be doing with my time,

1:36:48.900 --> 1:36:51.060
 then presumably you won't optimize

1:36:51.060 --> 1:36:53.740
 whatever it is that is important to you.

1:36:53.740 --> 1:36:58.060
 So you've, I think just in your eyes, in your work,

1:36:58.060 --> 1:37:03.060
 there's a passion that just is obvious and it's inspiring.

1:37:03.060 --> 1:37:04.380
 It's contagious.

1:37:04.380 --> 1:37:09.180
 What, if you were to give advice to us,

1:37:09.180 --> 1:37:10.700
 a young person today,

1:37:10.700 --> 1:37:14.660
 in the crazy chaos that we live today about life,

1:37:14.660 --> 1:37:19.660
 about how to discover their passion,

1:37:20.820 --> 1:37:23.220
 is there some words that you could give?

1:37:24.620 --> 1:37:26.220
 First of all, I would say the main thing

1:37:26.220 --> 1:37:29.500
 for a young person is stay adaptable.

1:37:29.500 --> 1:37:31.980
 And this is back to this issue of why COVID

1:37:31.980 --> 1:37:35.420
 is useful for us because it forces us off our tracks.

1:37:35.420 --> 1:37:39.020
 The fact is the jobs that will exist 20 years from now,

1:37:39.020 --> 1:37:40.100
 we don't even have names for it.

1:37:40.100 --> 1:37:42.540
 We can't even imagine the jobs that are gonna exist.

1:37:42.540 --> 1:37:44.980
 And so when young people that I know go into college

1:37:44.980 --> 1:37:47.460
 and they say, hey, what should I major in and so on,

1:37:47.460 --> 1:37:50.660
 college is and should be less and less vocational,

1:37:50.660 --> 1:37:52.300
 as in, oh, I'm gonna learn how to do this

1:37:52.300 --> 1:37:54.100
 and then I'm gonna do that the rest of my career.

1:37:54.100 --> 1:37:55.620
 The world just isn't that way anymore

1:37:55.620 --> 1:37:57.820
 with the exponential speed of things.

1:37:57.820 --> 1:38:00.460
 So the important thing is learning how to learn,

1:38:00.460 --> 1:38:03.540
 learning how to be livewired and adaptable.

1:38:03.540 --> 1:38:04.580
 That's really key.

1:38:04.580 --> 1:38:07.740
 And what I advise young people when I talk to them is,

1:38:09.540 --> 1:38:13.660
 what you digest, that's what gives you the raw storehouse

1:38:13.660 --> 1:38:17.380
 of things that you can remix and be creative with.

1:38:17.380 --> 1:38:21.220
 And so eat broadly and widely.

1:38:21.220 --> 1:38:23.020
 And obviously this is the wonderful thing

1:38:23.020 --> 1:38:24.620
 about the internet world we live in now

1:38:24.620 --> 1:38:25.580
 is you kind of can't help it.

1:38:25.580 --> 1:38:27.140
 You're constantly, whoa.

1:38:27.140 --> 1:38:28.900
 You go down some mole hole of Wikipedia

1:38:28.900 --> 1:38:31.140
 and you think, oh, I didn't even realize that was a thing.

1:38:31.140 --> 1:38:32.540
 I didn't know that existed.

1:38:32.540 --> 1:38:33.740
 And so.

1:38:33.740 --> 1:38:34.580
 Embrace that.

1:38:34.580 --> 1:38:36.220
 Embrace that, yeah, exactly.

1:38:36.220 --> 1:38:39.900
 And what I tell people is just always do a gut check

1:38:39.900 --> 1:38:41.500
 about, okay, I'm reading this paper

1:38:41.500 --> 1:38:44.260
 and yeah, I think that, but this paper, wow,

1:38:44.260 --> 1:38:47.700
 that really, I really cared about that in some way.

1:38:47.700 --> 1:38:50.500
 I tell them just to keep a real sniff out for that.

1:38:50.500 --> 1:38:54.020
 And when you find those things, keep going down those paths.

1:38:54.020 --> 1:38:55.020
 Yeah, don't be afraid.

1:38:55.020 --> 1:38:58.260
 I mean, that's one of the challenges and the downsides

1:38:58.260 --> 1:39:00.060
 of having so many beautiful options

1:39:00.060 --> 1:39:02.860
 is that sometimes people are a little bit afraid

1:39:02.860 --> 1:39:05.620
 to really commit, but that's very true.

1:39:05.620 --> 1:39:09.140
 If there's something that just sparks your interest

1:39:09.140 --> 1:39:10.860
 and passion, just run with it.

1:39:10.860 --> 1:39:13.420
 I mean, that's, it goes back to the Haider quote.

1:39:14.500 --> 1:39:16.220
 I mean, we only get this one life

1:39:16.220 --> 1:39:20.140
 and that trajectory, it doesn't last forever.

1:39:20.140 --> 1:39:23.540
 So just if something sparks your imagination,

1:39:23.540 --> 1:39:24.940
 your passion is run with it.

1:39:24.940 --> 1:39:26.380
 Yeah, exactly.

1:39:26.380 --> 1:39:29.940
 I don't think there's a more beautiful way to end it.

1:39:29.940 --> 1:39:32.620
 David, it's a huge honor to finally meet you.

1:39:32.620 --> 1:39:34.860
 Your work is inspiring so many people.

1:39:34.860 --> 1:39:36.340
 I've talked to so many people who are passionate

1:39:36.340 --> 1:39:39.220
 about neuroscience, about the brain, even outside

1:39:39.220 --> 1:39:40.900
 that read your book.

1:39:40.900 --> 1:39:43.700
 So I hope you keep doing so.

1:39:43.700 --> 1:39:46.100
 I think you're already there with Carl Sagan.

1:39:46.100 --> 1:39:47.460
 I hope you continue growing.

1:39:48.340 --> 1:39:50.060
 Yeah, it was an honor talking with you today.

1:39:50.060 --> 1:39:50.900
 Thanks so much.

1:39:50.900 --> 1:39:52.220
 Great, you too, Lex, wonderful.

 And now let me leave you with some words

1:40:20.100 --> 1:40:21.620
 from David Eagleman in his book,

1:40:21.620 --> 1:40:25.020
 Some Forty Tales from the Afterlives.

1:40:25.020 --> 1:40:28.020
 Imagine for a moment there were nothing but

1:40:28.020 --> 1:40:30.380
 the product of billions of years of molecules

1:40:30.380 --> 1:40:35.020
 coming together and ratcheting up through natural selection.

1:40:35.020 --> 1:40:37.380
 There were composed only of highways of fluids

1:40:37.380 --> 1:40:39.940
 and chemicals sliding along roadways

1:40:39.940 --> 1:40:42.540
 within billions of dancing cells.

1:40:42.540 --> 1:40:46.140
 The trillions of synaptic connections hum in parallel

1:40:46.140 --> 1:40:50.220
 that this vast egg like fabric of micro thin circuitry

1:40:50.220 --> 1:40:54.300
 runs algorithms undreamt of in modern science,

1:40:54.300 --> 1:40:56.660
 and that these neural programs give rise to

1:40:56.660 --> 1:41:01.660
 our decision making, loves, desires, fears, and aspirations.

1:41:02.900 --> 1:41:07.540
 To me, understanding this would be a numinous experience,

1:41:07.540 --> 1:41:11.940
 better than anything ever proposed in any holy text.

1:41:11.940 --> 1:41:23.940
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
