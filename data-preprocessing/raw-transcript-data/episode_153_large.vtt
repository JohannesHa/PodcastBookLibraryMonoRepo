00:00.000 --> 00:02.860
 The following is a conversation with Dmitry Korkin,

00:02.860 --> 00:04.820
 his second time in the podcast.

00:04.820 --> 00:06.980
 He's a professor of bioinformatics

00:06.980 --> 00:09.740
 and computational biology at WPI,

00:09.740 --> 00:13.540
 where he specializes in bioinformatics of complex disease,

00:13.540 --> 00:16.300
 computational genomics, systems biology,

00:16.300 --> 00:18.540
 and biomedical data analytics.

00:18.540 --> 00:22.080
 He loves biology, he loves computing,

00:22.080 --> 00:26.140
 plus he is Russian and recites a poem in Russian

00:26.140 --> 00:27.760
 at the end of the podcast.

00:27.760 --> 00:31.080
 What else could you possibly ask for in this world?

00:31.080 --> 00:32.960
 Quick mention of our sponsors.

00:32.960 --> 00:37.760

00:40.280 --> 00:42.920
 and 8sleep Self Cooling Mattress.

00:42.920 --> 00:46.360
 So the choice is browsing privacy, business success,

00:46.360 --> 00:49.180
 healthy diet, or comfortable sleep.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.600
 As a side note, let me say that to me,

00:58.600 --> 01:01.520
 the scientists that did the best apolitical,

01:01.520 --> 01:04.000
 impactful, brilliant work of 2020

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
 are the biologists who study viruses without an agenda,

01:09.160 --> 01:11.800
 without much sleep, to be honest,

01:11.800 --> 01:14.460
 just a pure passion for scientific discovery

01:14.460 --> 01:18.400
 and exploration of the mysteries within viruses.

01:18.400 --> 01:21.340
 Viruses are both terrifying and beautiful.

01:21.340 --> 01:22.960
 Terrifying because they can threaten

01:22.960 --> 01:25.120
 the fabric of human civilization,

01:25.120 --> 01:27.840
 both biological and psychological.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.480
 Beautiful because they give us insights

01:30.480 --> 01:32.920
 into the nature of life on Earth

01:32.920 --> 01:35.900
 and perhaps even extraterrestrial life

01:35.900 --> 01:37.960
 of the not so intelligent variety

01:37.960 --> 01:39.560
 that might meet us one day

01:39.560 --> 01:41.520
 as we explore the habitable planets

01:41.520 --> 01:43.760
 and moons in our universe.

01:53.160 --> 01:56.920
 And now here's my conversation with Dmitry Korkin.

01:57.920 --> 02:00.680
 It's often said that proteins

02:00.680 --> 02:04.200
 and the amino acid residues that make them up

02:04.200 --> 02:06.400
 are the building blocks of life.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.000
 Do you think of proteins in this way

02:08.000 --> 02:11.160
 as the basic building blocks of life?

02:11.160 --> 02:12.200
 Yes and no.

02:12.200 --> 02:16.300
 So the proteins indeed is the basic unit,

02:16.300 --> 02:20.480
 biological unit that carries out

02:20.480 --> 02:22.800
 important function of the cell.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.800
 However, through studying the proteins

02:25.800 --> 02:29.360
 and comparing the proteins across different species,

02:29.360 --> 02:31.440
 across different kingdoms,

02:31.440 --> 02:34.640
 you realize that proteins are actually

02:34.640 --> 02:36.760
 much more complicated.

02:36.760 --> 02:41.760
 So they have so called modular complexity.

02:42.280 --> 02:47.280
 And so what I mean by that is an average protein

02:47.280 --> 02:52.280
 consists of several structural units.

02:54.760 --> 02:57.440
 So we call them protein domains.

02:57.440 --> 03:02.440
 And so you can imagine a protein as a string of beads

03:02.580 --> 03:04.860
 where each bead is a protein domain.

03:05.760 --> 03:10.240
 And in the past 20 years,

03:10.240 --> 03:13.040
 scientists have been studying

03:13.040 --> 03:15.040
 the nature of the protein domains

03:15.040 --> 03:19.480
 because we realize that it's the unit.

03:19.480 --> 03:22.120
 Because if you look at the functions, right?

03:22.120 --> 03:25.880
 So many proteins have more than one function

03:25.880 --> 03:29.440
 and those protein functions are often carried out

03:29.440 --> 03:31.560
 by those protein domains.

03:31.560 --> 03:36.560
 So we also see that in the evolution,

03:37.320 --> 03:40.160
 those proteins domains get shuffled.

03:40.160 --> 03:43.460
 So they act actually as a unit.

03:43.460 --> 03:45.280
 Also from the structural perspective, right?

03:45.280 --> 03:50.280
 So some people think of a protein

03:50.960 --> 03:55.320
 as a sort of a globular molecule,

03:55.320 --> 03:56.800
 but as a matter of fact,

03:56.800 --> 04:01.800
 is the globular part of this protein is a protein domain.

04:02.500 --> 04:06.000
 So we often have this, again,

04:06.000 --> 04:09.600
 the collection of this protein domains

04:09.600 --> 04:14.600
 align on a string as beads.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.880
 And the protein domains are made up of amino acid residue.

04:17.880 --> 04:18.720
 So we're talking about.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.640
 So this is the basic,

04:20.640 --> 04:22.600
 so you're saying the protein domain

04:22.600 --> 04:25.640
 is the basic building block of the function

04:25.640 --> 04:28.320
 that we think about proteins doing.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.200
 So of course you can always talk

04:30.200 --> 04:31.520
 about different building blocks.

04:31.520 --> 04:32.880
 It's turtles all the way down.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.400
 But there's a point where there is,

04:36.280 --> 04:37.680
 at the point of the hierarchy

04:37.680 --> 04:42.680
 where it's the most, the cleanest element block

04:43.640 --> 04:46.240
 based on which you can put them together

04:46.240 --> 04:49.200
 in different kinds of ways to form complex function.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.880
 And you're saying protein domains,

04:50.880 --> 04:55.160
 why is that not talked about as often in popular culture?

04:55.160 --> 04:58.240
 Well, there are several perspectives on this.

04:59.280 --> 05:03.200
 And one of course is the historical perspective, right?

05:03.200 --> 05:07.800
 So historically scientists have been able

05:07.800 --> 05:10.120
 to structurally resolved

05:10.120 --> 05:14.240
 to obtain the 3D coordinates of a protein

05:14.240 --> 05:17.520
 for smaller proteins.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.000
 And smaller proteins tend to be a single domain protein.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
 So we have a protein equal to a protein domain.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.040
 And so because of that,

05:26.040 --> 05:29.640
 the initial suspicion was that the proteins are,

05:29.640 --> 05:31.680
 they have globular shapes

05:31.680 --> 05:36.680
 and the more of smaller proteins you obtain structurally,

05:36.840 --> 05:41.720
 the more you became convinced that that's the case.

05:41.720 --> 05:45.720
 And only later when we started having

05:47.920 --> 05:49.640
 alternative approaches.

05:49.640 --> 05:54.640
 So the traditional ones are X ray crystallography

05:55.920 --> 05:57.320
 and NMR spectroscopy.

05:57.320 --> 06:02.000
 So this is sort of the two main techniques

06:02.000 --> 06:04.440
 that give us the 3D coordinates.

06:04.440 --> 06:07.760
 But nowadays there's huge breakthrough

06:07.760 --> 06:10.480
 in cryo electron microscopy.

06:10.480 --> 06:13.840
 So the more advanced methods that allow us

06:13.840 --> 06:18.840
 to get into the 3D shapes of much larger molecules,

06:21.560 --> 06:23.480
 molecular complexes,

06:23.480 --> 06:28.120
 just to give you one of the common examples

06:28.120 --> 06:29.440
 for this year, right?

06:29.440 --> 06:32.760
 So the first experimental structure

06:32.760 --> 06:35.920
 of a SARS COVID 2 protein

06:35.920 --> 06:40.160
 was the cryo EM structure of the S protein.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.960
 So the spike protein.

06:41.960 --> 06:46.320
 And so it was solved very quickly.

06:46.320 --> 06:49.480
 And the reason for that is the advancement

06:49.480 --> 06:53.920
 of this technology is pretty spectacular.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.480
 How many domains does the, is it more than one domain?

06:57.480 --> 06:58.320
 Oh yes.

06:58.320 --> 07:01.320
 Oh yes, I mean, so it's a very complex structure.

07:01.320 --> 07:06.320
 And we, you know, on top of the complexity

07:06.480 --> 07:08.520
 of a single protein, right?

07:08.520 --> 07:13.520
 So this structure is actually is a complex, is a trimer.

07:13.720 --> 07:17.640
 So it needs to form a trimer in order to function properly.

07:17.640 --> 07:18.720
 What's a complex?

07:18.720 --> 07:22.880
 So a complex is a glomeration of multiple proteins.

07:22.880 --> 07:27.880
 And so we can have the same protein copied in multiple,

07:29.280 --> 07:32.080
 you know, made up in multiple copies

07:32.080 --> 07:36.160
 and forming something that we called a homo oligomer.

07:36.160 --> 07:38.120
 Homo means the same, right?

07:38.120 --> 07:42.800
 So in this case, so the spike protein is the,

07:42.800 --> 07:46.720
 is an example of a homo tetram, homo trimer, sorry.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.120
 So you need three copies of it?

07:48.120 --> 07:48.960
 Three copies.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.040
 In order to.

07:50.040 --> 07:50.880
 Exactly.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.760
 We have these three chains,

07:52.760 --> 07:56.800
 the three molecular chains coupled together

07:56.800 --> 07:58.480
 and performing the function.

07:58.480 --> 08:02.380
 That's what, when you look at this protein from the top,

08:02.380 --> 08:03.920
 you see a perfect triangle.

08:03.920 --> 08:04.760
 Yeah.

08:04.760 --> 08:07.120
 So, but other, you know,

08:07.120 --> 08:10.640
 so other complexes are made up of, you know,

08:10.640 --> 08:12.840
 different proteins.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.400
 Some of them are completely different.

08:15.400 --> 08:16.920
 Some of them are similar.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.880
 The hemoglobin molecule, right?

08:18.880 --> 08:21.880
 So it's actually, it's a protein complex.

08:21.880 --> 08:25.760
 It's made of four basic subunits.

08:25.760 --> 08:29.040
 Two of them are identical to each other.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.800
 Two other identical to each other,

08:30.800 --> 08:32.820
 but they are also similar to each other,

08:32.820 --> 08:36.960
 which sort of gives us some ideas about the evolution

08:36.960 --> 08:40.640
 of this, you know, of this molecule.

08:40.640 --> 08:44.000
 And perhaps, so one of the hypothesis is that, you know,

08:44.000 --> 08:48.280
 in the past, it was just a homo tetramer, right?

08:48.280 --> 08:50.840
 So four identical copies,

08:50.840 --> 08:55.520
 and then it became, you know, sort of modified,

08:55.520 --> 08:58.520
 it became mutated over the time

08:58.520 --> 09:00.160
 and became more specialized.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.560
 Can we linger on the spike protein for a little bit?

09:02.560 --> 09:04.940
 Is there something interesting

09:04.940 --> 09:06.960
 or like beautiful you find about it?

09:06.960 --> 09:07.880
 I mean, first of all,

09:07.880 --> 09:10.960
 it's an incredibly challenging protein.

09:10.960 --> 09:15.960
 And so we, as a part of our sort of research

09:16.120 --> 09:20.200
 to understand the structural basis of this virus,

09:20.200 --> 09:22.760
 to sort of decode, structurally decode,

09:22.760 --> 09:27.560
 every single protein in its proteome,

09:27.560 --> 09:31.800
 which, you know, we've been working on this spike protein.

09:31.800 --> 09:36.800
 And one of the main challenges was that the cryoEM data

09:36.800 --> 09:41.800
 allows us to reconstruct or to obtain the 3D coordinates

09:44.640 --> 09:48.040
 of roughly two thirds of the protein.

09:48.040 --> 09:51.960
 The rest of the one third of this protein,

09:51.960 --> 09:56.960
 it's a part that is buried into the membrane of the virus

09:58.400 --> 10:01.560
 and of the viral envelope.

10:01.560 --> 10:06.560
 And it also has a lot of unstable structures around it.

10:06.920 --> 10:08.640
 So it's chemically interacting somehow

10:08.640 --> 10:10.160
 with whatever the hex is connecting to.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.800
 Yeah, so people are still trying to understand.

10:12.800 --> 10:17.800
 So the nature of, and the role of this one third,

10:18.600 --> 10:23.120
 because the top part, you know, the primary function

10:23.120 --> 10:28.120
 is to get attached to the ACE2 receptor, human receptor.

10:28.120 --> 10:32.600
 There is also beautiful mechanics

10:32.600 --> 10:34.720
 of how this thing happens, right?

10:34.720 --> 10:39.720
 So because there are three different copies of this chains,

10:39.800 --> 10:43.480
 you know, there are three different domains, right?

10:43.480 --> 10:44.800
 So we're talking about domains.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.840
 So this is the receptor binding domains, RBDs,

10:47.840 --> 10:52.840
 that gets untangled and get ready to get attached

10:53.840 --> 10:55.400
 to the receptor.

10:55.400 --> 11:00.400
 And now they are not necessarily going in a sync mode.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.080
 As a matter of fact.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.240
 It's asynchronous.

11:05.240 --> 11:10.240
 So yes, and this is where another level of complexity

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
 comes into play because right now what we see is,

11:16.000 --> 11:20.520
 we typically see just one of the arms going out

11:20.520 --> 11:25.520
 and getting ready to be attached to the ACE2 receptors.

11:27.560 --> 11:30.360
 However, there was a recent mutation

11:30.360 --> 11:35.080
 that people studied in that spike protein.

11:35.080 --> 11:40.080
 And very recently, a group from UMass Medical School

11:43.560 --> 11:45.280
 will happen to collaborate with groups.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.240
 So this is a group of Jeremy Lubin

11:47.240 --> 11:50.640
 and a number of other faculty.

11:51.560 --> 11:56.560
 They actually solve the mutated structure of the spike.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
 And they showed that actually, because of these mutations,

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
 you have more than one arms opening up.

12:08.880 --> 12:13.880
 And so now, so the frequency of two arms going up

12:13.880 --> 12:17.200
 increase quite drastically.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.040
 Interesting.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.120
 Does that change the dynamics somehow?

12:20.120 --> 12:22.920
 It potentially can change the dynamics

12:22.920 --> 12:27.280
 because now you have two possible opportunities

12:27.280 --> 12:30.000
 to get attached to the ACE2 receptor.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.120
 It's a very complex molecular process, mechanistic process.

12:34.120 --> 12:38.280
 But the first step of this process is the attachment

12:38.280 --> 12:42.560
 of this spike protein, of the spike trimer

12:42.560 --> 12:46.600
 to the human ACE2 receptor.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.880
 So this is a molecule that sits

12:48.880 --> 12:51.920
 on the surface of the human cell.

12:51.920 --> 12:54.720
 And that's essentially what initiates,

12:54.720 --> 12:58.880
 what triggers the whole process of encapsulation.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.440
 If this was dating, this would be the first date.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.160
 So this is the...

13:03.160 --> 13:04.200
 In a way.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.640
 Yes.

13:05.640 --> 13:07.920
 So is it possible to have the spike protein

13:07.920 --> 13:10.640
 just like floating about on its own?

13:10.640 --> 13:14.680
 Or does it need that interactability with the membrane?

13:14.680 --> 13:16.920
 Yeah, so it needs to be attached,

13:16.920 --> 13:19.040
 at least as far as I know.

13:19.040 --> 13:23.320
 But when you get this thing attached on the surface,

13:23.320 --> 13:25.120
 there is also a lot of dynamics

13:25.120 --> 13:28.200
 on how it sits on the surface.

13:28.200 --> 13:32.200
 So for example, there was a recent work in,

13:32.200 --> 13:35.800
 again, where people use the cryolectron microscopy

13:35.800 --> 13:38.960
 to get the first glimpse of the overall structure.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.600
 It's a very low res, but you still get

13:41.600 --> 13:45.160
 some interesting details about the surface,

13:45.160 --> 13:47.040
 about what is happening inside,

13:47.040 --> 13:50.760
 because we have literally no clue until recent work

13:50.760 --> 13:54.520
 about how the capsid is organized.

13:54.520 --> 13:55.360
 What's a capsid?

13:55.360 --> 13:56.720
 So a capsid is essentially,

13:56.720 --> 14:01.040
 it's the inner core of the viral particle

14:01.040 --> 14:05.000
 where there is the RNA of the virus,

14:05.000 --> 14:09.200
 and it's protected by another protein, N protein,

14:10.280 --> 14:13.440
 that essentially acts as a shield.

14:13.440 --> 14:16.520
 But now we are learning more and more,

14:16.520 --> 14:18.600
 so it's actually, it's not just this shield,

14:18.600 --> 14:21.800
 it potentially is used for the stability

14:21.800 --> 14:25.040
 of the outer shell of the virus.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.840
 So it's pretty complicated.

14:27.840 --> 14:30.480
 And I mean, understanding all of this is really useful

14:30.480 --> 14:33.000
 for trying to figure out like developing a vaccine

14:33.000 --> 14:34.680
 or some kind of drug to attack,

14:34.680 --> 14:36.040
 any aspects of this, right?

14:36.040 --> 14:39.640
 So, I mean, there are many different implications to that.

14:39.640 --> 14:43.040
 First of all, it's important to understand

14:43.040 --> 14:44.560
 the virus itself, right?

14:44.560 --> 14:49.560
 So in order to understand how it acts,

14:51.560 --> 14:55.320
 what is the overall mechanistic process

14:55.320 --> 14:57.320
 of this virus replication,

14:57.320 --> 15:00.560
 of this virus proliferation to the cell, right?

15:00.560 --> 15:03.000
 So that's one aspect.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.480
 The other aspect is designing new treatments.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.040
 So one of the possible treatments

15:09.040 --> 15:12.480
 is designing nanoparticles.

15:12.480 --> 15:17.200
 And so some nanoparticles that will resemble the viral shape

15:17.200 --> 15:19.520
 that would have the spike integrated,

15:19.520 --> 15:23.680
 and essentially would act as a competitor to the real virus

15:23.680 --> 15:26.680
 by blocking the ACE2 receptors,

15:26.680 --> 15:30.400
 and thus preventing the real virus entering the cell.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.920
 Now, there are also, you know,

15:32.920 --> 15:35.600
 there is a very interesting direction

15:35.600 --> 15:38.320
 in looking at the membrane,

15:38.320 --> 15:40.960
 at the envelope portion of the protein

15:40.960 --> 15:44.880
 and attacking its M protein.

15:44.880 --> 15:48.320
 So there are, you know, to give you a, you know,

15:48.320 --> 15:50.120
 sort of a brief overview,

15:50.120 --> 15:52.320
 there are four structural proteins.

15:52.320 --> 15:54.560
 These are the proteins that made up

15:54.560 --> 15:58.160
 a structure of the virus.

15:58.160 --> 16:02.920
 So SPIKE, S protein that acts as a trimer,

16:02.920 --> 16:04.880
 so it needs three copies.

16:06.080 --> 16:09.720
 E, envelope protein that acts as a pantomime,

16:09.720 --> 16:13.400
 so it needs five copies to act properly.

16:13.400 --> 16:18.400
 M is a membrane protein, it forms dimers,

16:18.600 --> 16:20.560
 and actually it forms beautiful lattice.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.480
 And this is something that we've been studying

16:22.480 --> 16:24.520
 and we are seeing it in simulations.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.920
 It actually forms a very nice grid

16:26.920 --> 16:30.600
 or, you know, threads, you know,

16:30.600 --> 16:33.600
 of different dimers attached next to each other.

16:33.600 --> 16:34.960
 Just a bunch of copies of each other,

16:34.960 --> 16:36.960
 and they naturally, when you have a bunch of copies

16:36.960 --> 16:38.960
 of each other, they form an interesting lattice.

16:38.960 --> 16:39.800
 Exactly.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.280
 And, you know, if you think about this, right?

16:42.280 --> 16:47.280
 So this complex, you know, the viral shape

16:48.160 --> 16:52.160
 needs to be organized somehow, self organized somehow, right?

16:52.160 --> 16:56.160
 So it, you know, if it was a completely random process,

16:56.160 --> 17:01.160
 you know, you probably wouldn't have the envelope shell

17:02.080 --> 17:03.920
 of the ellipsoid shape, you know,

17:03.920 --> 17:05.880
 you would have something, you know,

17:05.880 --> 17:07.600
 pretty random, right, shape.

17:07.600 --> 17:10.560
 So there is some, you know, regularity

17:10.560 --> 17:15.560
 in how this, you know, how this M dimers

17:16.720 --> 17:18.480
 get to attach to each other

17:18.480 --> 17:20.520
 in a very specific directed way.

17:20.520 --> 17:21.920
 Is that understood at all?

17:23.080 --> 17:24.280
 It's not understood.

17:24.280 --> 17:28.400
 We are now, we've been working in the past six months

17:28.400 --> 17:30.160
 since, you know, we met, actually,

17:30.160 --> 17:33.400
 this is where we started working on trying to understand

17:33.400 --> 17:36.280
 the overall structure of the envelope

17:36.280 --> 17:40.640
 and the key components that made up this, you know,

17:40.640 --> 17:41.480
 structure.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.240
 Wait, does the envelope also have the lattice structure

17:43.240 --> 17:44.080
 or no?

17:44.080 --> 17:47.360
 So the envelope is essentially is the outer shell

17:47.360 --> 17:48.800
 of the viral particle.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.600
 The N, the nucleocapsid protein,

17:51.600 --> 17:53.960
 is something that is inside.

17:53.960 --> 17:54.800
 Got it.

17:54.800 --> 17:59.520
 But get that, the N is likely to interact with M.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.480
 Does it go M and E?

18:01.480 --> 18:02.880
 Like, where's the E and the M?

18:02.880 --> 18:05.640
 So E, those different proteins,

18:05.640 --> 18:10.640
 they occur in different copies on the viral particle.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.960
 So E, this pentamer complex,

18:13.960 --> 18:18.960
 we only have two or three, maybe, per each particle, okay?

18:18.960 --> 18:23.960
 We have thousand or so of M dimers

18:24.520 --> 18:26.600
 that essentially made up,

18:26.600 --> 18:30.920
 that makes up the entire, you know, outer shell.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.680
 So most of the outer shell is the M.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.520
 M dimer.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.640
 And the M protein.

18:35.640 --> 18:38.160
 When you say particle, that's the virion,

18:38.160 --> 18:40.120
 the virus, the individual virus.

18:40.120 --> 18:40.960
 It's a single, yes.

18:40.960 --> 18:43.640
 Single element of the virus, it's a single virus.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.080
 Single virus, right.

18:45.080 --> 18:50.080
 And we have about, you know, roughly 50 to 90 spike trimmers.

18:50.840 --> 18:51.680
 Right?

18:51.680 --> 18:54.000
 So when you, you know, when you show a...

18:54.000 --> 18:55.040
 Per virus particle.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.560
 Per virus particle.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.680
 Sorry, what did you say, 50 to 90?

18:58.680 --> 19:00.680
 50 to 90, right?

19:00.680 --> 19:04.000
 So this is how this thing is organized.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.400
 And so now, typically, right,

19:06.400 --> 19:11.400
 so you see these, the antibodies that target,

19:11.480 --> 19:13.240
 you know, spike protein,

19:13.240 --> 19:15.200
 certain parts of the spike protein,

19:15.200 --> 19:17.960
 but there could be some, also some treatments, right?

19:17.960 --> 19:22.000
 So these are, you know, these are small molecules

19:22.000 --> 19:27.000
 that bind strategic parts of these proteins,

19:27.520 --> 19:29.680
 disrupting its function.

19:29.680 --> 19:34.040
 So one of the promising directions,

19:34.040 --> 19:35.600
 it's one of the newest directions,

19:35.600 --> 19:40.600
 is actually targeting the M dimer of the protein.

19:40.600 --> 19:44.120
 Targeting the proteins that make up this outer shell.

19:44.120 --> 19:47.640
 Because if you're able to destroy the outer shell,

19:47.640 --> 19:52.160
 you're essentially destroying the viral particle itself.

19:52.160 --> 19:56.720
 So preventing it from, you know, functioning at all.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.160
 So that's, you think is,

19:59.160 --> 20:01.440
 from a sort of cyber security perspective,

20:01.440 --> 20:02.960
 virus security perspective,

20:02.960 --> 20:05.160
 that's the best attack vector?

20:05.160 --> 20:08.440
 Is, or like, that's a promising attack vector?

20:08.440 --> 20:09.280
 I would say, yeah.

20:09.280 --> 20:12.680
 So, I mean, there's still tons of research needs to be,

20:12.680 --> 20:14.000
 you know, to be done.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.560
 But yes, I think, you know, so.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.880
 There's more attack surface, I guess.

20:18.880 --> 20:19.880
 More attack surface.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.280
 But, you know, from our analysis,

20:22.280 --> 20:24.200
 from other evolutionary analysis,

20:24.200 --> 20:28.000
 this protein is evolutionarily more stable

20:28.000 --> 20:31.200
 compared to the, say, to the spike protein.

20:31.200 --> 20:35.520
 Oh, and stable means a more static target?

20:35.520 --> 20:38.400
 Well, yeah, so it doesn't change.

20:38.400 --> 20:42.120
 It doesn't evolve from the evolutionary perspective

20:42.120 --> 20:46.000
 so drastically as, for example, the spike protein.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.960
 There's a bunch of stuff in the news

20:47.960 --> 20:51.400
 about mutations of the virus in the United Kingdom.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.160
 I also saw in South Africa something.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.440
 Maybe that was yesterday.

20:56.360 --> 21:00.200
 You just kind of mentioned about stability and so on.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.800
 Which aspects of this are mutatable

21:02.800 --> 21:07.600
 and which aspects, if mutated, become more dangerous?

21:07.600 --> 21:09.280
 And maybe even zooming out,

21:09.280 --> 21:12.080
 what are your thoughts and knowledge and ideas

21:12.080 --> 21:13.680
 about the way it's mutated,

21:13.680 --> 21:15.360
 all the news that we've been hearing?

21:15.360 --> 21:18.520
 Are you worried about it from a biological perspective?

21:18.520 --> 21:21.280
 Are you worried about it from a human perspective?

21:21.280 --> 21:26.280
 So, I mean, you know, mutations are sort of a general way

21:26.320 --> 21:28.640
 for these viruses to evolve, right?

21:28.640 --> 21:32.680
 So, it's, you know, it's essentially,

21:32.680 --> 21:34.760
 this is the way they evolve.

21:34.760 --> 21:38.680
 This is the way they were able to jump

21:38.680 --> 21:42.080
 from one species to another.

21:42.080 --> 21:46.800
 We also see some recent jumps.

21:46.800 --> 21:50.000
 There were some incidents of this virus jumping

21:50.000 --> 21:51.880
 from human to dogs.

21:51.880 --> 21:55.880
 So, you know, there is some danger in those jumps

21:55.880 --> 21:59.520
 because every time it jumps, it also mutates, right?

21:59.520 --> 22:04.400
 So, when it jumps to the species

22:04.400 --> 22:06.160
 and jumps back, right?

22:06.160 --> 22:08.320
 So, it acquires some mutations

22:08.320 --> 22:13.320
 that are sort of driven by the environment

22:14.360 --> 22:16.360
 of a new host, right?

22:16.360 --> 22:19.280
 And it's different from the human environment.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.480
 And so, we don't know whether the mutations

22:21.480 --> 22:24.920
 that are acquired in the new species

22:24.920 --> 22:28.160
 are neutral with respect to the human host

22:28.160 --> 22:32.080
 or maybe, you know, maybe damaging.

22:32.080 --> 22:36.560
 Yeah, change is always scary, but so are you worried about,

22:36.560 --> 22:38.960
 I mean, it seems like because the spread is,

22:38.960 --> 22:42.200
 during winter now, seems to be exceptionally high

22:43.560 --> 22:46.760
 and especially with a vaccine just around the corner

22:46.760 --> 22:49.160
 already being actually deployed,

22:49.160 --> 22:53.000
 is there some worry that this puts evolutionary pressure,

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
 selective pressure on the virus for it to mutate?

22:59.000 --> 23:00.440
 Is that a source of worry?

23:00.440 --> 23:03.440
 Well, I mean, there is always this thought

23:03.440 --> 23:08.440
 in the scientist's mind, you know, what will happen, right?

23:08.720 --> 23:12.520
 So, I know there've been discussions

23:12.520 --> 23:17.520
 about sort of the arms race between the ability

23:17.600 --> 23:22.600
 of the humanity to get vaccinated faster

23:22.600 --> 23:27.600
 than the virus, you know, essentially, you know,

23:27.600 --> 23:31.600
 it becomes, you know, resistant to the vaccine.

23:34.200 --> 23:39.200
 I mean, I don't worry that much simply because,

23:40.920 --> 23:44.920
 you know, there is not that much evidence to that.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.440
 To aggressive mutation around the vaccine.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.960
 Exactly, you know, obviously there are mutations

23:49.960 --> 23:54.960
 around the vaccine, so the reason we get vaccinated

23:56.080 --> 24:00.080
 every year against the seasonal mutations, right?

24:01.280 --> 24:05.280
 But, you know, I think it's important to study it.

24:06.120 --> 24:07.120
 No doubts, right?

24:07.120 --> 24:10.120
 So, I think one of the, you know, to me,

24:10.120 --> 24:14.120
 and again, I might be biased because, you know,

24:14.120 --> 24:17.120
 we've been trying to do that as well,

24:17.120 --> 24:20.120
 so, but one of the critical directions

24:20.120 --> 24:23.920
 in understanding the virus is to understand its evolution

24:23.920 --> 24:27.480
 in order to sort of understand the mechanisms,

24:27.480 --> 24:30.960
 the key mechanisms that lead the virus to jump,

24:30.960 --> 24:34.240
 you know, the Nordic viruses to jump from species,

24:34.240 --> 24:37.440
 from species to another, that the mechanisms

24:37.440 --> 24:42.440
 that lead the virus to become resistant to vaccines,

24:42.480 --> 24:44.680
 also to treatments, right?

24:44.680 --> 24:48.520
 And hopefully that knowledge will enable us

24:48.520 --> 24:52.520
 to sort of forecast the evolutionary traces,

24:52.520 --> 24:55.160
 the future evolutionary traces of this virus.

24:55.160 --> 24:58.080
 I mean, what, from a biological perspective,

24:58.080 --> 24:59.320
 this might be a dumb question,

24:59.320 --> 25:04.320
 but is there parts of the virus that if souped up,

25:05.080 --> 25:09.080
 like through mutation, could make it more effective

25:09.080 --> 25:09.920
 at doing its job?

25:09.920 --> 25:12.520
 We're talking about this specific coronavirus

25:12.520 --> 25:14.880
 because we were talking about the different, like,

25:14.880 --> 25:18.440
 the membrane, the M protein, the E protein,

25:18.440 --> 25:23.440
 the N and the S, the spike, is there some?

25:24.080 --> 25:27.880
 And there are 20 or so more in addition to that.

25:27.880 --> 25:29.840
 But is that a dumb way to look at it?

25:29.840 --> 25:34.520
 Like, which of these, if mutated,

25:34.520 --> 25:39.520
 could have the greatest impact, potentially damaging impact,

25:39.640 --> 25:41.520
 on the effectiveness of the virus?

25:41.520 --> 25:44.520
 So it's actually, it's a very good question

25:44.520 --> 25:48.120
 because, and the short answer is, we don't know yet.

25:48.120 --> 25:51.560
 But of course there is capacity of this virus

25:51.560 --> 25:53.560
 to become more efficient.

25:53.560 --> 25:56.680
 The reason for that is, you know,

25:56.680 --> 25:59.760
 so if you look at the virus, I mean, it's a machine, right?

25:59.760 --> 26:03.520
 So it's a machine that does a lot of different functions,

26:03.520 --> 26:06.520
 and many of these functions are sort of nearly perfect,

26:06.520 --> 26:07.840
 but they're not perfect.

26:07.840 --> 26:11.360
 And those mutations can have the greatest impact

26:11.360 --> 26:14.120
 and make those functions more perfect.

26:14.120 --> 26:18.240
 For example, the attachment to ACE2 receptor, right,

26:18.240 --> 26:19.400
 of the spike, right?

26:19.400 --> 26:24.400
 So, you know, has this virus reached the efficiency

26:28.360 --> 26:31.560
 in which the attachment is carried out?

26:31.560 --> 26:36.080
 Or there are some mutations that still to be discovered,

26:36.080 --> 26:41.080
 right, that will make this attachment sort of stronger,

26:41.920 --> 26:46.920
 or, you know, something more, in a way more efficient

26:48.560 --> 26:51.880
 from the point of view of this virus functioning.

26:51.880 --> 26:54.640
 That's sort of the obvious example.

26:54.640 --> 26:57.480
 But if you look at each of these proteins,

26:57.480 --> 26:58.840
 I mean, it's there for a reason,

26:58.840 --> 27:00.760
 it performs certain function.

27:00.760 --> 27:05.760
 And it could be that certain mutations will, you know,

27:07.120 --> 27:08.480
 enhance this function.

27:08.480 --> 27:11.560
 It could be that some mutations will make this function

27:11.560 --> 27:13.720
 much less efficient, right?

27:13.720 --> 27:15.360
 So that's also the case.

27:16.200 --> 27:18.880
 Let's, since we're talking about the evolutionary history

27:18.880 --> 27:22.720
 of a virus, let's zoom back out

27:22.720 --> 27:25.240
 and look at the evolution of proteins.

27:25.240 --> 27:29.960
 I glanced at this 2010 Nature paper

27:29.960 --> 27:34.320
 on the quote, ongoing expansion of the protein universe.

27:34.320 --> 27:39.320
 And then, you know, it kind of implies and talks about

27:39.480 --> 27:42.520
 that proteins started with a common ancestor,

27:42.520 --> 27:44.720
 which is, you know, kind of interesting.

27:44.720 --> 27:45.960
 It's interesting to think about like,

27:45.960 --> 27:49.840
 even just like the first organic thing

27:49.840 --> 27:51.840
 that started life on Earth.

27:51.840 --> 27:56.000
 And from that, there's now, you know, what is it?

27:56.000 --> 27:59.880
 3.5 billion years later, there's now millions of proteins.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.320
 And they're still evolving.

28:01.320 --> 28:02.960
 And that's, you know, in part,

28:02.960 --> 28:05.000
 one of the things that you're researching.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.200
 Is there something interesting to you about the evolution

28:09.200 --> 28:14.200
 of proteins from this initial ancestor to today?

28:14.600 --> 28:16.280
 Is there something beautiful and insightful

28:16.280 --> 28:18.120
 about this long story?

28:18.120 --> 28:23.120
 So I think, you know, if I were to pick a single keyword

28:24.120 --> 28:29.120
 about protein evolution, I would pick modularity,

28:29.120 --> 28:32.720
 something that we talked about in the beginning.

28:32.720 --> 28:36.960
 And that's the fact that the proteins are no longer

28:36.960 --> 28:41.280
 considered as, you know, as a sequence of letters.

28:41.280 --> 28:45.880
 There are hierarchical complexities

28:45.880 --> 28:48.240
 in the way these proteins are organized.

28:48.240 --> 28:51.720
 And these complexities are actually going

28:51.720 --> 28:53.920
 beyond the protein sequence.

28:53.920 --> 28:57.720
 It's actually going all the way back to the gene,

28:57.720 --> 29:00.000
 to the nucleotide sequence.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.840
 And so, you know, again, these protein domains,

29:04.840 --> 29:07.840
 they are not only functional building blocks,

29:07.840 --> 29:09.920
 they are also evolutionary building blocks.

29:09.920 --> 29:12.560
 And so what we see in the sort of,

29:12.560 --> 29:15.120
 in the later stages of evolution,

29:15.120 --> 29:18.720
 I mean, once this stable structurally

29:18.720 --> 29:22.040
 and functionally building blocks were discovered,

29:22.040 --> 29:28.040
 they essentially, they stay, those domains stay as such.

29:28.040 --> 29:31.560
 So that's why if you start comparing different proteins,

29:31.560 --> 29:36.560
 you will see that many of them will have similar fragments.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.640
 And those fragments will correspond to something

29:39.640 --> 29:42.280
 that we call protein domain families.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.040
 And so they are still different

29:44.040 --> 29:48.520
 because you still have mutations and, you know,

29:48.520 --> 29:53.200
 the, you know, different mutations are attributed to,

29:53.200 --> 29:56.200
 to, you know, diversification of the function

29:56.200 --> 29:58.840
 of this, you know, protein domains.

29:58.840 --> 30:03.520
 However, you don't, you very rarely see, you know,

30:03.520 --> 30:07.840
 the evolutionary events that would split

30:07.840 --> 30:10.520
 this domain into fragments because,

30:10.520 --> 30:17.240
 and it's, you know, once you have the domain split,

30:17.240 --> 30:20.240
 you actually, you, you know,

30:20.240 --> 30:24.000
 you can completely cancel out its function

30:24.000 --> 30:26.600
 or at the very least you can reduce it.

30:26.600 --> 30:29.640
 And that's not, you know, efficient from the point of view

30:29.640 --> 30:32.880
 of the, you know, of the cell functioning.

30:32.880 --> 30:37.240
 So, so the, the, the protein domain level

30:37.240 --> 30:39.160
 is a very important one.

30:39.160 --> 30:42.040
 Now, on top of that, right?

30:42.040 --> 30:44.120
 So if you look at the proteins, right,

30:44.120 --> 30:46.360
 so you have this structural units

30:46.360 --> 30:48.200
 and they carry out the function,

30:48.200 --> 30:51.880
 but then much less is known about things

30:51.880 --> 30:54.400
 that connect this protein domains,

30:54.400 --> 30:56.400
 something that we call linkers.

30:56.400 --> 31:00.760
 And those linkers are completely flexible, you know,

31:00.760 --> 31:03.520
 parts of the protein that nevertheless

31:03.520 --> 31:06.360
 carry out a lot of function.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.040
 So it's like little tails, little heads.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.840
 So, so, so we do have tails.

31:09.840 --> 31:12.320
 So they're called termini, C and N termini.

31:12.320 --> 31:17.160
 So these are things right on the, on, on, on one

31:17.160 --> 31:20.040
 and another ends of the protein sequence.

31:20.040 --> 31:22.560
 So they are also very important.

31:22.560 --> 31:26.320
 So they, they attributed to very specific interactions

31:26.320 --> 31:27.720
 between the proteins.

31:27.720 --> 31:28.560
 So.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.800
 But you're referring to the links between domains.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.600
 That connect the domains.

31:32.600 --> 31:36.160
 And, you know, apart from the, just the,

31:36.160 --> 31:39.840
 the simple perspective, if you have, you know,

31:39.840 --> 31:43.720
 a very short domain, you have, sorry, a very short linker,

31:43.720 --> 31:45.880
 you have two domains next to each other.

31:45.880 --> 31:47.560
 They are forced to be next to each other.

31:47.560 --> 31:49.080
 If you have a very long one,

31:49.080 --> 31:52.040
 you have the domains that are extremely flexible

31:52.040 --> 31:54.320
 and they carry out a lot of sort of

31:54.320 --> 31:56.880
 spatial reorganization, right?

31:56.880 --> 31:58.120
 That's awesome.

31:58.120 --> 32:01.960
 But on top of that, right, just this linker itself,

32:01.960 --> 32:05.760
 because it's so flexible, it actually can adapt

32:05.760 --> 32:07.480
 to a lot of different shapes.

32:07.480 --> 32:11.080
 And therefore it's a, it's a very good interactor

32:11.080 --> 32:14.000
 when it comes to interaction between this protein

32:14.000 --> 32:15.720
 and other protein, right?

32:15.720 --> 32:18.920
 So these things also evolve, you know,

32:18.920 --> 32:23.920
 and they in a way have different sort of laws of

32:25.480 --> 32:30.480
 the driving laws that underlie the evolution

32:30.600 --> 32:33.400
 because they no longer need to,

32:33.400 --> 32:37.120
 to preserve certain structure, right?

32:37.120 --> 32:38.880
 Unlike protein domains.

32:38.880 --> 32:41.480
 And so on top of that,

32:41.480 --> 32:45.840
 you have something that is even less studied.

32:45.840 --> 32:49.640
 And this is something that attribute to,

32:49.640 --> 32:53.240
 to the concept of alternative splicing.

32:53.240 --> 32:54.480
 So alternative splicing.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.920
 So it's a, it's a very cool concept.

32:56.920 --> 33:00.840
 It's something that we've been fascinated about for,

33:00.840 --> 33:03.520
 you know, over a decade in my lab

33:03.520 --> 33:05.520
 and trying to do research with that.

33:05.520 --> 33:08.080
 But so, you know, so typically, you know,

33:08.080 --> 33:12.480
 a simplistic perspective is that one gene

33:12.480 --> 33:16.040
 is equal one protein product, right?

33:16.040 --> 33:18.320
 So you have a gene, you know,

33:18.320 --> 33:21.120
 you transcribe it and translate it

33:21.120 --> 33:22.880
 and it becomes a protein.

33:24.600 --> 33:28.360
 In reality, when we talk about eukaryotes,

33:28.360 --> 33:32.320
 especially sort of more recent eukaryotes

33:32.320 --> 33:33.800
 that are very complex,

33:33.800 --> 33:38.800
 the gene is no longer equal to one protein.

33:40.200 --> 33:45.200
 It actually can produce multiple functionally,

33:47.040 --> 33:50.280
 you know, active protein products.

33:50.280 --> 33:52.720
 And each of them is, you know,

33:52.720 --> 33:57.040
 is called an alternatively spliced product.

33:57.040 --> 34:00.960
 The reason it happens is that if you look at the gene,

34:00.960 --> 34:05.560
 it actually has, it has also blocks.

34:05.560 --> 34:08.320
 And the blocks, some of which,

34:08.320 --> 34:10.680
 and it's essentially, it goes like this.

34:10.680 --> 34:13.880
 So we have a block that will later be translated.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.040
 We call it exon.

34:15.040 --> 34:19.240
 Then we'll have a block that is not translated, cut out.

34:19.240 --> 34:20.400
 We call it intron.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.840
 So we have exon, intron, exon, intron,

34:22.840 --> 34:24.120
 et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, right?

34:24.120 --> 34:26.920
 So sometimes you can have, you know,

34:26.920 --> 34:29.880
 dozens of these exons and introns.

34:29.880 --> 34:32.680
 So what happens is during the process

34:32.680 --> 34:35.800
 when the gene is converted to RNA,

34:37.320 --> 34:41.280
 we have things that are cut out,

34:41.280 --> 34:43.240
 the introns that are cut out,

34:43.240 --> 34:47.160
 and exons that now get assembled together.

34:47.160 --> 34:51.320
 And sometimes we will throw out some of the exons

34:52.320 --> 34:54.600
 and the remaining protein product will become

34:54.600 --> 34:55.440
 still be the same.

34:55.440 --> 34:56.280
 Different.

34:56.280 --> 34:57.120
 Oh, different.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.960
 So now you have fragments of the protein

34:59.960 --> 35:01.360
 that no longer there.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.800
 They were cut out with the introns.

35:03.800 --> 35:07.520
 Sometimes you will essentially take one exon

35:07.520 --> 35:09.840
 and replace it with another one, right?

35:09.840 --> 35:12.600
 So there's some flexibility in this process.

35:12.600 --> 35:17.200
 So that creates a whole new level of complexity.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.040
 Cause now.

35:18.040 --> 35:18.880
 Is this random though?

35:18.880 --> 35:19.720
 Is it random?

35:19.720 --> 35:20.840
 It's not random.

35:20.840 --> 35:24.480
 We, and this is where I think now the appearance

35:24.480 --> 35:27.360
 of this modern single cell

35:27.360 --> 35:31.240
 and before that tissue level sequencing,

35:31.240 --> 35:34.280
 next generation sequencing techniques such as RNA seed

35:34.280 --> 35:38.200
 allows us to see that these are the events

35:38.200 --> 35:41.040
 that often happen in response.

35:41.040 --> 35:44.560
 It's a dynamic event that happens in response

35:44.560 --> 35:48.320
 to disease or in response

35:48.320 --> 35:51.800
 to certain developmental stage of a cell.

35:51.800 --> 35:56.800
 And this is an incredibly complex layer

35:56.840 --> 35:59.800
 that also undergoes, I mean,

35:59.800 --> 36:01.560
 because it's at the gene level, right?

36:01.560 --> 36:05.440
 So it undergoes certain evolution, right?

36:05.440 --> 36:08.680
 And now we have this interplay

36:08.680 --> 36:12.720
 between what is happening in the protein world

36:12.720 --> 36:17.720
 and what is happening in the gene and RNA world.

36:17.720 --> 36:22.720
 And for example, it's often that we see

36:22.720 --> 36:27.720
 that the boundaries of this exons coincide

36:28.200 --> 36:32.160
 with the boundaries of the protein domains, right?

36:32.160 --> 36:36.520
 So there is this close interplay to that.

36:36.520 --> 36:39.280
 It's not always, I mean, otherwise it would be too simple,

36:39.280 --> 36:40.120
 right?

36:40.120 --> 36:41.880
 But we do see the connection

36:41.880 --> 36:45.000
 between those sort of machineries.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.760
 And obviously the evolution will pick up this complexity

36:49.760 --> 36:51.800
 and, you know.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.480
 Select for whatever is successful,

36:53.480 --> 36:55.040
 whatever is interesting function.

36:55.040 --> 36:57.560
 We see that complexity in play

36:57.560 --> 37:02.560
 and makes this question more complex, but more exciting.

37:02.560 --> 37:05.440
 Small detour, I don't know if you think about this

37:05.440 --> 37:07.540
 into the world of computer science.

37:07.540 --> 37:11.240
 There's a Douglas Hostetter, I think,

37:11.240 --> 37:14.360
 came up with the name of Quine,

37:14.360 --> 37:16.180
 which are, I don't know if you're familiar

37:16.180 --> 37:18.880
 with these things, but it's computer programs

37:18.880 --> 37:22.160
 that have, I guess, exon and intron,

37:22.160 --> 37:24.800
 and they copy, the whole purpose of the program

37:24.800 --> 37:26.240
 is to copy itself.

37:26.240 --> 37:28.480
 So it prints copies of itself,

37:28.480 --> 37:30.980
 but can also carry information inside of it.

37:30.980 --> 37:35.440
 So it's a very kind of crude, fun exercise of,

37:36.420 --> 37:40.000
 can we sort of replicate these ideas from cells?

37:40.000 --> 37:42.940
 Can we have a computer program that when you run it,

37:42.940 --> 37:47.080
 just print itself, the entirety of itself,

37:47.080 --> 37:50.040
 and does it in different programming languages and so on.

37:50.040 --> 37:51.960
 I've been playing around and writing them.

37:51.960 --> 37:53.720
 It's a kind of fun little exercise.

37:53.720 --> 37:55.720
 You know, when I was a kid, so you know,

37:55.720 --> 38:00.720
 it was essentially one of the sort of main stages

38:02.860 --> 38:07.860
 in informatics Olympiads that you have to reach

38:08.280 --> 38:10.880
 in order to be any so good,

38:10.880 --> 38:14.400
 is you should be able to write a program

38:14.400 --> 38:16.680
 that replicates itself.

38:16.680 --> 38:20.920
 And so the task then becomes even sort of more complicated.

38:20.920 --> 38:24.040
 So what is the shortest program?

38:24.040 --> 38:27.480
 And of course, it's a function of a programming language,

38:27.480 --> 38:30.940
 but yeah, I remember a long, long, long time ago

38:30.940 --> 38:34.840
 when we tried to make it short and short

38:34.840 --> 38:36.520
 and find the shortcut.

38:36.520 --> 38:41.520
 There's actually on a stack exchange, there's a entire site

38:41.720 --> 38:44.160
 called CodeGolf, I think,

38:44.160 --> 38:46.560
 where the entirety is just the competition.

38:46.560 --> 38:50.380
 People just come up with whatever task, I don't know,

38:50.380 --> 38:54.680
 like write code that reports the weather today.

38:54.680 --> 38:58.680
 And the competition is about whatever programming language,

38:58.680 --> 39:00.440
 what is the shortest program?

39:00.440 --> 39:02.280
 And it makes you actually, people should check it out

39:02.280 --> 39:03.640
 because it makes you realize

39:03.640 --> 39:07.160
 there's some weird programming languages out there.

39:07.160 --> 39:11.740
 But just to dig on that a little deeper,

39:12.640 --> 39:16.100
 do you think, in computer science,

39:16.100 --> 39:19.280
 we don't often think about programs,

39:19.280 --> 39:21.280
 just like the machine learning world now,

39:22.280 --> 39:26.280
 that's still kind of basic programs.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.600
 And then there's humans that replicate themselves, right?

39:29.600 --> 39:31.440
 And there's these mutations and so on.

39:31.440 --> 39:34.520
 Do you think we'll ever have a world

39:34.520 --> 39:36.320
 where there's programs that kind of

39:37.760 --> 39:40.640
 have an evolutionary process?

39:40.640 --> 39:42.640
 So I'm not talking about evolutionary algorithms,

39:42.640 --> 39:44.640
 but I'm talking about programs that kind of

39:44.640 --> 39:46.480
 mate with each other and evolve

39:46.480 --> 39:49.600
 and like on their own replicate themselves.

39:49.600 --> 39:54.600
 So this is kind of the idea here is,

39:54.640 --> 39:57.140
 that's how you can have a runaway thing.

39:57.140 --> 39:59.240
 So we think about machine learning as a system

39:59.240 --> 40:01.320
 that gets smarter and smarter and smarter and smarter.

40:01.320 --> 40:05.240
 At least the machine learning systems of today are like,

40:05.240 --> 40:09.000
 it's a program that you can like turn off,

40:09.000 --> 40:12.680
 as opposed to throwing a bunch of little programs out there

40:12.680 --> 40:15.560
 and letting them like multiply and mate

40:15.560 --> 40:17.320
 and evolve and replicate.

40:17.320 --> 40:20.400
 Do you ever think about that kind of world,

40:20.400 --> 40:23.360
 when we jump from the biological systems

40:23.360 --> 40:27.160
 that you're looking at to artificial ones?

40:27.160 --> 40:32.160
 I mean, it's almost like you take the sort of the area

40:32.440 --> 40:34.360
 of intelligent agents, right?

40:34.360 --> 40:38.640
 Which are essentially the independent sort of codes

40:38.640 --> 40:42.480
 that run and interact and exchange the information, right?

40:42.480 --> 40:45.120
 So I don't see why not.

40:45.120 --> 40:48.760
 I mean, it could be sort of a natural evolution

40:48.760 --> 40:52.880
 in this area of computer science.

40:52.880 --> 40:54.640
 I think it's kind of an interesting possibility.

40:54.640 --> 40:55.880
 It's terrifying too,

40:55.880 --> 40:58.360
 but I think it's a really powerful tool.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.680
 Like to have like agents that, you know,

41:00.680 --> 41:02.800
 we have social networks with millions of people

41:02.800 --> 41:03.840
 and they interact.

41:03.840 --> 41:05.720
 I think it's interesting to inject into that,

41:05.720 --> 41:08.380
 was already injected into that bots, right?

41:08.380 --> 41:10.040
 But those bots are pretty dumb.

41:11.240 --> 41:14.720
 You know, they're probably pretty dumb algorithms.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.480
 You know, it's interesting to think

41:17.480 --> 41:20.440
 that there might be bots that evolve together with humans.

41:20.440 --> 41:23.960
 And there's the sea of humans and robots

41:23.960 --> 41:26.520
 that are operating first in the digital space.

41:26.520 --> 41:29.080
 And then you can also think, I love the idea.

41:29.080 --> 41:32.600
 Some people worked, I think at Harvard, at Penn,

41:32.600 --> 41:36.680
 there's robotics labs that, you know,

41:37.560 --> 41:40.600
 take as a fundamental task to build a robot

41:40.600 --> 41:44.920
 that given extra resources can build another copy of itself,

41:44.920 --> 41:46.560
 like in the physical space,

41:46.560 --> 41:50.900
 which is super difficult to do, but super interesting.

41:50.900 --> 41:54.020
 I remember there's like research on robots

41:54.020 --> 41:55.240
 that can build a bridge.

41:55.240 --> 41:56.880
 So they make a copy of themselves

41:56.880 --> 41:57.960
 and they connect themselves

41:57.960 --> 42:00.560
 and the sort of like self building bridge

42:00.560 --> 42:02.380
 based on building blocks.

42:02.380 --> 42:05.640
 You can imagine like a building that self assembles.

42:05.640 --> 42:07.560
 So it's basically self assembling structures

42:07.560 --> 42:10.620
 from robotic parts.

42:10.620 --> 42:13.880
 But it's interesting to, within that robot,

42:13.880 --> 42:15.920
 add the ability to mutate

42:15.920 --> 42:20.920
 and do all the interesting like little things

42:21.320 --> 42:23.200
 that you're referring to in evolution

42:23.200 --> 42:26.320
 to go from a single origin protein building block

42:26.320 --> 42:28.920
 to like this weird complex.

42:28.920 --> 42:30.960
 And if you think about this, I mean, you know,

42:30.960 --> 42:34.600
 the bits and pieces are there, you know.

42:34.600 --> 42:37.040
 So you mentioned the evolution algorithm, right?

42:37.040 --> 42:38.520
 You know, so this is sort of,

42:38.520 --> 42:43.520
 and maybe sort of the goal is in a way different, right?

42:43.520 --> 42:46.720
 So the goal is to, you know, to essentially,

42:46.720 --> 42:50.080
 to optimize your search, right?

42:50.080 --> 42:53.060
 So, but sort of the ideas are there.

42:53.060 --> 42:55.080
 So people recognize that, you know,

42:55.080 --> 43:00.080
 that the recombination events lead to global changes

43:01.160 --> 43:04.440
 in the search trajectories, the mutations event

43:04.440 --> 43:09.080
 is a more refined, you know, step in the search.

43:09.080 --> 43:13.340
 Then you have, you know, other sort of

43:14.220 --> 43:16.480
 nature inspired algorithm, right?

43:16.480 --> 43:19.580
 So one of the reasons that, you know,

43:19.580 --> 43:21.940
 I think it's one of the funnest one

43:21.940 --> 43:24.820
 is the slime based algorithm, right?

43:24.820 --> 43:28.220
 So it's, I think the first was introduced

43:28.220 --> 43:30.220
 by the Japanese group,

43:30.220 --> 43:35.220
 where it was able to solve some pre complex problems.

43:35.220 --> 43:40.220
 So that's, and then I think there are still a lot of things

43:43.340 --> 43:48.340
 we've yet to, you know, borrow from the nature, right?

43:48.960 --> 43:52.020
 So there are a lot of sort of ideas

43:52.020 --> 43:56.740
 that nature, you know, gets to offer us that, you know,

43:56.740 --> 44:01.020
 it's up to us to grab it and to, you know,

44:01.020 --> 44:02.140
 get the best use of it.

44:02.140 --> 44:06.380
 Including neural networks, you know, we have a very crude

44:06.380 --> 44:08.300
 inspiration from nature on neural networks.

44:08.300 --> 44:10.920
 Maybe there's other inspirations to be discovered

44:10.920 --> 44:15.920
 in the brain or other aspects of the various systems,

44:16.280 --> 44:20.140
 even like the immune system, the way it interplays.

44:20.140 --> 44:22.580
 I recently started to understand that the,

44:22.580 --> 44:24.360
 like the immune system has something to do

44:24.360 --> 44:26.020
 with the way the brain operates.

44:26.020 --> 44:28.360
 Like there's multiple things going on in there,

44:28.360 --> 44:30.500
 which all of which are not modeled

44:30.500 --> 44:32.140
 in artificial neural networks.

44:32.140 --> 44:35.380
 And maybe if you throw a little bit of that biological spice

44:35.380 --> 44:39.020
 in there, you'll come up with something, something cool.

44:39.020 --> 44:42.540
 I'm not sure if you're familiar with the Drake equation

44:43.740 --> 44:46.740
 that estimate, I just did a video on it yesterday

44:46.740 --> 44:49.280
 because I wanted to give my own estimate of it.

44:49.280 --> 44:52.340
 It's an equation that combines a bunch of factors

44:52.340 --> 44:56.980
 to estimate how many alien civilizations are in the galaxy.

44:56.980 --> 44:58.500
 I've heard about it, yes.

44:58.500 --> 45:01.340
 So one of the interesting parameters, you know,

45:01.340 --> 45:05.980
 it's like how many stars are born every year,

45:05.980 --> 45:10.980
 how many planets are on average per star for this,

45:11.700 --> 45:14.260
 how many habitable planets are there.

45:14.260 --> 45:17.580
 And then the one that starts being really interesting

45:18.660 --> 45:23.660
 is the probability that life emerges on a habitable planet.

45:24.740 --> 45:27.900
 So like, I don't know if you think about,

45:27.900 --> 45:29.720
 you certainly think a lot about evolution,

45:29.720 --> 45:31.060
 but do you think about the thing

45:31.060 --> 45:32.520
 which evolution doesn't describe,

45:32.520 --> 45:36.620
 which is like the beginning of evolution, the origin of life.

45:36.620 --> 45:39.320
 I think I put the probability of life developing

45:39.320 --> 45:41.800
 in a habitable planet at 1%.

45:41.800 --> 45:44.440
 This is very scientifically rigorous.

45:44.440 --> 45:48.740
 Okay, well, first at a high level for the Drake equation,

45:48.740 --> 45:51.660
 what would you put that percent at on earth?

45:51.660 --> 45:55.100
 And in general, do you have something,

45:55.100 --> 45:58.220
 do you have thoughts about how life might've started,

45:58.220 --> 46:01.100
 you know, like the proteins being the first kind of,

46:01.100 --> 46:02.940
 one of the early jumping points?

46:02.940 --> 46:07.500
 Yeah, so I think back in 2018,

46:07.500 --> 46:10.460
 there was a very exciting paper published in Nature

46:10.460 --> 46:15.460
 where they found one of the simplest amino acids,

46:18.320 --> 46:23.320
 glycine, in a comet dust.

46:23.320 --> 46:28.320
 So this is, and I apologize if I don't pronounce,

46:29.440 --> 46:31.840
 it's a Russian named comet,

46:31.840 --> 46:34.760
 it's I think Chugryumov Gerasimenko.

46:34.760 --> 46:38.760
 This is the comet where, and there was this mission

46:40.000 --> 46:45.000
 to get close to this comet and get the stardust

46:46.320 --> 46:48.160
 from its tail.

46:48.160 --> 46:50.620
 And when scientists analyzed it,

46:50.620 --> 46:55.620
 they actually found traces of, you know, of glycine,

46:56.640 --> 46:59.400
 which, you know, makes up, you know,

46:59.400 --> 47:04.180
 it's one of the basic, one of the 20 basic amino acids

47:04.180 --> 47:06.400
 that makes up proteins, right?

47:06.400 --> 47:10.960
 So that was kind of very exciting, right?

47:10.960 --> 47:14.220
 But, you know, the question is very interesting, right?

47:14.220 --> 47:18.540
 So what, you know, if there is some alien life,

47:18.540 --> 47:22.940
 is it gonna be made of proteins, right?

47:22.940 --> 47:24.340
 Or maybe RNAs, right?

47:24.340 --> 47:29.120
 So we see that, you know, the RNA viruses are certainly,

47:29.120 --> 47:34.120
 you know, very well established sort of, you know,

47:35.020 --> 47:37.820
 group of molecular machines, right?

47:37.820 --> 47:42.140
 So, yeah, it's a very interesting question.

47:42.140 --> 47:43.580
 What probability would you put?

47:43.580 --> 47:45.260
 Like, how hard is this job?

47:45.260 --> 47:48.740
 Like, how unlikely just on Earth do you think

47:48.740 --> 47:51.600
 this whole thing is that we got going?

47:51.600 --> 47:54.620
 Like, are we really lucky or is it inevitable?

47:54.620 --> 47:56.240
 Like, what's your sense when you sit back

47:56.240 --> 47:58.820
 and think about life on Earth?

47:58.820 --> 48:00.980
 Is it higher or lower than 1%?

48:00.980 --> 48:03.420
 Well, because 1% is pretty low, but it still is like,

48:03.420 --> 48:05.060
 damn, that's a pretty good chance.

48:05.060 --> 48:06.600
 Yes, it's a pretty good chance.

48:06.600 --> 48:10.580
 I mean, I would, personally, but again, you know,

48:10.580 --> 48:14.140
 I'm, you know, probably not the best person

48:14.140 --> 48:19.140
 to do such estimations, but I would, you know,

48:19.340 --> 48:23.100
 intuitively, I would probably put it lower.

48:23.100 --> 48:24.820
 But still, I mean, you know, given.

48:24.820 --> 48:26.620
 So we're really lucky here on Earth.

48:27.980 --> 48:28.820
 I mean.

48:28.820 --> 48:30.500
 Or the conditions are really good.

48:30.500 --> 48:32.340
 It's, you know, I think that there was,

48:32.340 --> 48:35.460
 everything was right in a way, right?

48:35.460 --> 48:39.720
 So we still, it's not, the conditions were not like ideal

48:39.720 --> 48:44.060
 if you try to look at, you know, what was, you know,

48:44.060 --> 48:48.340
 several billions years ago when the life emerged.

48:48.340 --> 48:52.020
 So there is something called the Rare Earth Hypothesis

48:52.020 --> 48:55.740
 that, you know, in counter to the Drake Equation says

48:55.740 --> 49:00.240
 that the, you know, the conditions of Earth,

49:00.240 --> 49:03.260
 if you actually were to describe Earth,

49:03.260 --> 49:05.700
 it's quite a special place.

49:05.700 --> 49:09.120
 So special it might be unique in our galaxy

49:09.120 --> 49:11.780
 and potentially, you know, close to unique

49:11.780 --> 49:12.860
 in the entire universe.

49:12.860 --> 49:14.740
 Like it's very difficult to reconstruct

49:14.740 --> 49:16.380
 those same conditions.

49:16.380 --> 49:19.580
 And what the Rare Earth Hypothesis argues

49:19.580 --> 49:23.100
 is all those different conditions are essential for life.

49:23.100 --> 49:26.180
 And so that's sort of the counter, you know,

49:26.180 --> 49:29.220
 like all the things we, you know,

49:29.220 --> 49:31.740
 thinking that Earth is pretty average.

49:31.740 --> 49:34.340
 I mean, I can't really, I'm trying to remember

49:34.340 --> 49:36.140
 to go through all of them, but just the fact

49:36.140 --> 49:41.140
 that it is shielded from a lot of asteroids,

49:41.140 --> 49:43.820
 the, obviously the distance to the sun,

49:43.820 --> 49:48.220
 but also the fact that it's like a perfect balance

49:48.220 --> 49:52.180
 between the amount of water and land

49:52.180 --> 49:53.660
 and all those kinds of things.

49:53.660 --> 49:55.180
 I don't know, there's a bunch of different factors

49:55.180 --> 49:57.520
 that I don't remember, there's a long list.

49:57.520 --> 50:01.260
 But it's fascinating to think about if in order

50:01.260 --> 50:05.020
 for something like proteins and then DNA and RNA

50:05.020 --> 50:10.020
 to emerge, you need, and basic living organisms,

50:10.020 --> 50:14.960
 you need to be very close to an Earth like planet,

50:14.960 --> 50:19.740
 which will be sad or exciting, I don't know which.

50:19.740 --> 50:23.220
 If you ask me, I, you know, in a way I put a parallel

50:23.220 --> 50:28.220
 between, you know, between our own research.

50:28.380 --> 50:33.380
 And I mean, from the intuitive perspective,

50:33.820 --> 50:36.700
 you know, you have those two extremes

50:36.700 --> 50:40.820
 and the reality is never very rarely falls

50:40.820 --> 50:41.900
 into the extremes.

50:41.900 --> 50:46.500
 It's always the optimus always reached somewhere in between.

50:46.500 --> 50:50.060
 So, and that's what I tend to think.

50:50.060 --> 50:54.020
 I think that, you know, we're probably somewhere in between.

50:54.020 --> 50:58.220
 So they were not unique, unique, but again,

50:58.220 --> 51:01.940
 the chances are, you know, reasonably small.

51:01.940 --> 51:04.180
 The problem is we don't know the other extreme

51:04.180 --> 51:08.060
 is like, I tend to think that we don't actually understand

51:08.060 --> 51:11.900
 the basic mechanisms of like what this is all originated

51:11.900 --> 51:15.060
 from, like, it seems like we think of life

51:15.060 --> 51:17.100
 as this distinct thing, maybe intelligence

51:17.100 --> 51:20.380
 is a distinct thing, maybe the physics that,

51:20.380 --> 51:24.380
 from which planets and suns are born is a distinct thing.

51:24.380 --> 51:27.140
 But that could be a very, it's like the Stephen Wolfram

51:27.140 --> 51:29.420
 thing, it's like the, from simple rules emerges

51:29.420 --> 51:31.020
 greater and greater complexity.

51:31.020 --> 51:34.940
 So, you know, I tend to believe that just life finds a way.

51:36.100 --> 51:39.540
 Like, we don't know the extreme of how common life is

51:39.540 --> 51:43.660
 because it could be life is like everywhere.

51:44.980 --> 51:49.420
 Like, so everywhere that it's almost like laughable,

51:49.420 --> 51:52.140
 like that we're such idiots to think who are you?

51:52.140 --> 51:56.260
 Like, it's like ridiculous to even like think,

51:56.260 --> 51:59.460
 it's like ants thinking that their little colony

51:59.460 --> 52:03.220
 is the unique thing and everything else doesn't exist.

52:03.220 --> 52:07.540
 I mean, it's also very possible that that's the extreme

52:07.540 --> 52:09.900
 and we're just not able to maybe comprehend

52:09.900 --> 52:12.860
 the nature of that life.

52:12.860 --> 52:16.580
 Just to stick on alien life for just a brief moment more,

52:16.580 --> 52:21.580
 there is some signs of life on Venus in gaseous form.

52:22.260 --> 52:27.260
 There's hope for life on Mars, probably extinct.

52:27.260 --> 52:29.220
 We're not talking about intelligent life.

52:29.220 --> 52:32.340
 Although that has been in the news recently.

52:32.340 --> 52:36.300
 We're talking about basic like, you know, bacteria.

52:36.300 --> 52:40.820
 Yeah, and then also, I guess, there's a couple moons.

52:40.820 --> 52:41.660
 Europe.

52:41.660 --> 52:45.100
 Yeah, Europa, which is Jupiter's moon.

52:45.100 --> 52:46.580
 I think there's another one.

52:46.580 --> 52:50.380
 Are you, is that exciting or is it terrifying to you

52:50.380 --> 52:52.140
 that we might find life?

52:52.140 --> 52:53.580
 Do you hope we find life?

52:53.580 --> 52:56.020
 I certainly do hope that we find life.

52:56.020 --> 53:01.020
 I mean, it was very exciting to hear about this news

53:05.380 --> 53:09.260
 about the possible life on Venus.

53:09.260 --> 53:12.540
 It'd be nice to have hard evidence of something with,

53:12.540 --> 53:17.140
 which is what the hope is for Mars and Europa.

53:17.140 --> 53:18.420
 But do you think those organisms

53:18.420 --> 53:20.780
 will be similar biologically

53:20.780 --> 53:23.940
 or would they even be sort of carbon based

53:23.940 --> 53:25.740
 if we do find them?

53:25.740 --> 53:28.940
 I would say they would be carbon based.

53:28.940 --> 53:31.820
 How similar, it's a big question, right?

53:31.820 --> 53:36.820
 So it's the moment we discover things outside Earth, right?

53:39.540 --> 53:43.260
 Even if it's a tiny little single cell.

53:43.260 --> 53:45.380
 I mean, there is so much.

53:45.380 --> 53:47.660
 Just imagine that, that would be so.

53:47.660 --> 53:50.700
 I think that that would be another turning point

53:50.700 --> 53:52.540
 for the science, you know?

53:52.540 --> 53:56.220
 Especially if it's different in some very new way.

53:56.220 --> 53:57.060
 That's exciting.

53:57.060 --> 53:59.700
 Because that says, that's a definitive statement,

53:59.700 --> 54:01.780
 not a definitive, but a pretty strong statement

54:01.780 --> 54:05.420
 that life is everywhere in the universe.

54:05.420 --> 54:07.700
 To me at least, that's really exciting.

54:08.940 --> 54:13.460
 You brought up Joshua Lederberg in an offline conversation.

54:13.460 --> 54:15.780
 I think I'd love to talk to you about Alpha Fold

54:15.780 --> 54:17.220
 and this might be an interesting way

54:17.220 --> 54:19.580
 to enter that conversation because,

54:19.580 --> 54:24.500
 so he won the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine

54:24.500 --> 54:29.020
 for discovering that bacteria can mate and exchange genes.

54:29.020 --> 54:32.220
 But he also did a ton of other stuff,

54:32.220 --> 54:37.220
 like we mentioned, helping NASA find life on Mars

54:37.740 --> 54:40.980
 and the...

54:40.980 --> 54:42.580
 Dendro. Dendro.

54:42.580 --> 54:45.260
 The chemical expert system.

54:45.260 --> 54:46.860
 Expert systems, remember those?

54:46.860 --> 54:51.380
 What do you find interesting about this guy

54:51.380 --> 54:54.980
 and his ideas about artificial intelligence in general?

54:54.980 --> 54:59.980
 So I have a kind of personal story to share.

55:00.180 --> 55:05.140
 So I started my PhD in Canada back in 2000.

55:05.140 --> 55:07.740
 And so essentially my PhD was,

55:07.740 --> 55:10.100
 so we were developing sort of a new language

55:10.100 --> 55:12.540
 for symbolic machine learning.

55:12.540 --> 55:15.100
 So it's different from the feature based machine learning.

55:15.100 --> 55:19.820
 And one of the sort of cleanest applications

55:19.820 --> 55:23.980
 of this approach, of this formalism

55:23.980 --> 55:28.820
 was to cheminformatics and computer aided drug design.

55:28.820 --> 55:32.700
 So essentially we were, as a part of my research,

55:33.820 --> 55:37.380
 I developed a system that essentially looked

55:37.380 --> 55:42.380
 at chemical compounds of say the same therapeutic category,

55:42.380 --> 55:45.540
 you know, male hormones, right?

55:45.540 --> 55:50.540
 And try to figure out the structural fragments

55:51.740 --> 55:54.420
 that are the structural building blocks

55:54.420 --> 55:58.140
 that are important that define this class

55:58.140 --> 55:59.780
 versus structural building blocks

55:59.780 --> 56:02.700
 that are there just because, you know,

56:02.700 --> 56:04.260
 to complete the structure.

56:04.260 --> 56:06.060
 But they are not essentially the ones

56:06.060 --> 56:10.020
 that make up the chemical, the key chemical properties

56:10.020 --> 56:12.780
 of this therapeutic category.

56:12.780 --> 56:16.900
 And, you know, for me, it was something new.

56:16.900 --> 56:20.580
 I was trained as an applied mathematicians, you know,

56:20.580 --> 56:22.980
 as with some machine learning background,

56:22.980 --> 56:25.060
 but, you know, computer aided drug design

56:25.060 --> 56:27.660
 was a completely new territory.

56:27.660 --> 56:31.500
 So because of that, I often find myself

56:31.500 --> 56:34.340
 asking lots of questions on one of these

56:34.340 --> 56:36.940
 sort of central forums.

56:36.940 --> 56:40.420
 Back then, there were no Facebooks or stuff like that.

56:40.420 --> 56:43.620
 There was a forum, you know, it's a forum.

56:43.620 --> 56:45.780
 It's essentially, it's like a bulletin board.

56:45.780 --> 56:46.620
 Yeah.

56:46.620 --> 56:47.460
 On the internet.

56:47.460 --> 56:50.300
 Yeah, so you essentially, you have a bunch of people

56:50.300 --> 56:52.900
 and you post a question and you get, you know,

56:52.900 --> 56:55.300
 an answer from, you know, different people.

56:55.300 --> 56:59.300
 And back then, just like one of the most popular forums

56:59.300 --> 57:04.300
 was CCL, I think Computational Chemistry Library,

57:04.300 --> 57:07.100
 not library, but something like that,

57:07.100 --> 57:09.820
 but CCL, that was the forum.

57:09.820 --> 57:12.780
 And there, I, you know, I...

57:12.780 --> 57:14.060
 Asked a lot of dumb questions.

57:14.060 --> 57:15.500
 Yes, I asked questions.

57:15.500 --> 57:19.340
 Also shared some, you know, some information

57:19.340 --> 57:21.460
 about how formal it is and how we do

57:21.460 --> 57:25.100
 and whether whatever we do makes sense.

57:25.100 --> 57:29.180
 And so, you know, and I remember that one of these posts,

57:29.180 --> 57:31.420
 I mean, I still remember, you know,

57:31.420 --> 57:35.340
 I would call it desperately looking

57:35.340 --> 57:40.340
 for a chemist advice, something like that, right?

57:40.740 --> 57:43.980
 And so I post my question, I explained, you know,

57:43.980 --> 57:48.980
 how formalism is, what it does

57:49.220 --> 57:53.180
 and what kind of applications I'm planning to do.

57:53.180 --> 57:55.020
 And, you know, and it was, you know,

57:55.020 --> 57:59.660
 in the middle of the night and I went back to bed.

57:59.660 --> 58:04.660
 And next morning, have a phone call from my advisor

58:04.780 --> 58:06.900
 who also looked at this forum.

58:06.900 --> 58:11.020
 It's like, you won't believe who replied to you.

58:11.020 --> 58:13.900
 And it's like, who?

58:13.900 --> 58:16.300
 And he said, well, you know, there is a message

58:16.300 --> 58:17.900
 to you from Joshua Lederberg.

58:19.140 --> 58:22.660
 And my reaction was like, who is Joshua Lederberg?

58:22.660 --> 58:29.660
 Your advisor hung up. So, and essentially, you know,

58:29.660 --> 58:34.060
 Joshua wrote me that we had conceptually similar ideas

58:34.060 --> 58:36.660
 in the dendrial project.

58:36.660 --> 58:38.220
 You may wanna look it up.

58:39.300 --> 58:42.620
 And we should also, sorry, and it's a side comment,

58:42.620 --> 58:45.940
 say that even though he won the Nobel Prize

58:45.940 --> 58:49.820
 at a really young age, in 58, but so he was,

58:49.820 --> 58:52.860
 I think he was what, 33.

58:52.860 --> 58:53.980
 It's just crazy.

58:53.980 --> 58:57.660
 So anyway, so that's, so hence in the 90s,

58:57.660 --> 59:02.100
 responding to young whippersnappers on the CCL forum.

59:02.100 --> 59:02.940
 Okay.

59:02.940 --> 59:05.820
 And so back then he was already very senior.

59:05.820 --> 59:09.580
 I mean, he unfortunately passed away back in 2008,

59:09.580 --> 59:12.580
 but, you know, back in 2001, he was, I mean,

59:12.580 --> 59:15.980
 he was a professor emeritus at Rockefeller University.

59:15.980 --> 59:18.460
 And, you know, that was actually, believe it or not,

59:18.460 --> 59:23.460
 one of the reasons I decided to join, you know,

59:25.460 --> 59:28.140
 as a postdoc, the group of Andre Salle,

59:28.140 --> 59:30.820
 who was at Rockefeller University,

59:30.820 --> 59:33.460
 with the hope that, you know, that I could actually,

59:33.460 --> 59:38.060
 you know, have a chance to meet Joshua in person.

59:38.060 --> 59:40.860
 And I met him very briefly, right?

59:42.140 --> 59:45.380
 Just because he was walking, you know,

59:45.380 --> 59:47.860
 there's a little bridge that connects the,

59:47.860 --> 59:50.860
 sort of the research campus with the,

59:51.940 --> 59:55.500
 with the sort of skyscraper that Rockefeller owns,

59:55.500 --> 59:58.780
 the where, you know, postdocs and faculty

59:58.780 --> 1:00:00.260
 and graduate students live.

1:00:00.260 --> 1:00:02.460
 And so I met him, you know,

1:00:02.460 --> 1:00:06.340
 and had a very short conversation, you know.

1:00:06.340 --> 1:00:10.380
 But so I started, you know, reading about Dendral

1:00:10.380 --> 1:00:12.660
 and I was amazed, you know, it's,

1:00:12.660 --> 1:00:16.100
 we're talking about 1960, right?

1:00:16.100 --> 1:00:19.300
 The ideas were so profound.

1:00:19.300 --> 1:00:21.140
 Well, what's the fun about the ideas of it?

1:00:21.140 --> 1:00:25.020
 The reason to make this is even crazier.

1:00:25.020 --> 1:00:29.860
 So, Lederberg wanted to make a system

1:00:29.860 --> 1:00:34.860
 that would help him study the extraterrestrial molecules,

1:00:38.220 --> 1:00:39.060
 right?

1:00:39.060 --> 1:00:40.980
 So, the idea was that, you know,

1:00:40.980 --> 1:00:43.420
 the way you study the extraterrestrial molecules

1:00:43.420 --> 1:00:46.780
 is you do the mass spec analysis, right?

1:00:46.780 --> 1:00:49.700
 And so the mass spec gives you sort of bits,

1:00:49.700 --> 1:00:52.620
 numbers about essentially gives you the ideas

1:00:52.620 --> 1:00:55.900
 about the possible fragments or, you know,

1:00:55.900 --> 1:00:59.820
 atoms, you know, and maybe a little fragments,

1:00:59.820 --> 1:01:03.620
 pieces of this molecule that make up the molecule, right?

1:01:03.620 --> 1:01:06.060
 So now you need to sort of,

1:01:06.060 --> 1:01:09.180
 to decompose this information

1:01:09.180 --> 1:01:12.460
 and to figure out what was the hole

1:01:12.460 --> 1:01:17.460
 before it became fragments, bits and pieces, right?

1:01:17.660 --> 1:01:20.860
 So, in order to make this, you know,

1:01:20.860 --> 1:01:25.660
 to have this tool, the idea of Lederberg

1:01:25.660 --> 1:01:30.660
 was to connect chemistry, computer science,

1:01:32.060 --> 1:01:36.100
 and to design this so called expert system

1:01:36.100 --> 1:01:38.180
 that looks, that takes into account,

1:01:38.180 --> 1:01:42.180
 that takes as an input the mass spec data,

1:01:42.180 --> 1:01:47.180
 the possible database of possible molecules

1:01:47.980 --> 1:01:52.660
 and essentially try to sort of induce the molecule

1:01:52.660 --> 1:01:55.580
 that would correspond to this spectra

1:01:55.580 --> 1:02:00.580
 or, you know, essentially what this project ended up being

1:02:03.060 --> 1:02:07.100
 was that, you know, it would provide a list of candidates

1:02:07.100 --> 1:02:11.940
 that then a chemist would look at and make final decision.

1:02:11.940 --> 1:02:12.780
 So.

1:02:12.780 --> 1:02:13.980
 But the original idea, I suppose,

1:02:13.980 --> 1:02:16.820
 is to solve the entirety of this problem automatically.

1:02:16.820 --> 1:02:17.660
 Yes, yes.

1:02:17.660 --> 1:02:21.940
 So he, you know, so he,

1:02:21.940 --> 1:02:25.180
 back then he approached. 60s.

1:02:25.180 --> 1:02:28.940
 Yes, believe that, it's amazing.

1:02:28.940 --> 1:02:32.220
 I mean, it still blows my mind, you know, that it's,

1:02:32.220 --> 1:02:37.220
 that's, and this was essentially the origin

1:02:37.420 --> 1:02:41.100
 of the modern bioinformatics, cheminformatics,

1:02:41.100 --> 1:02:42.780
 you know, back in 60s.

1:02:42.780 --> 1:02:47.780
 So that's, you know, every time you deal with projects

1:02:48.540 --> 1:02:51.340
 like this, with the, you know, research like this,

1:02:51.340 --> 1:02:56.340
 you just, you know, so the power of the, you know,

1:02:56.340 --> 1:03:01.340
 intelligence of this people is just, you know, overwhelming.

1:03:01.740 --> 1:03:05.420
 Do you think about expert systems, is there,

1:03:05.420 --> 1:03:10.380
 and why they kind of didn't become successful,

1:03:10.380 --> 1:03:12.500
 especially in the space of bioinformatics,

1:03:12.500 --> 1:03:15.380
 where it does seem like there is a lot of expertise

1:03:15.380 --> 1:03:20.060
 in humans, and, you know, it's possible to see

1:03:20.060 --> 1:03:23.580
 that a system like this could be made very useful.

1:03:23.580 --> 1:03:24.420
 Right.

1:03:24.420 --> 1:03:25.260
 And be built up.

1:03:25.260 --> 1:03:26.900
 So it's actually, it's a great question,

1:03:26.900 --> 1:03:30.460
 and this is something, so, you know, so, you know,

1:03:30.460 --> 1:03:33.900
 at my university, I teach artificial intelligence,

1:03:33.900 --> 1:03:37.940
 and, you know, we start, my first two lectures

1:03:37.940 --> 1:03:40.140
 are on the history of AI.

1:03:40.140 --> 1:03:44.380
 And there we, you know, we try to, you know,

1:03:45.300 --> 1:03:48.180
 go through the main stages of AI.

1:03:48.180 --> 1:03:53.180
 And so, you know, the question of why expert systems failed

1:03:54.260 --> 1:03:58.540
 or became obsolete, it's actually a very interesting one.

1:03:58.540 --> 1:04:01.980
 And there are, you know, if you try to read the, you know,

1:04:01.980 --> 1:04:03.340
 the historical perspectives,

1:04:03.340 --> 1:04:05.540
 there are actually two lines of thoughts.

1:04:05.540 --> 1:04:10.540
 One is that they were essentially

1:04:11.940 --> 1:04:14.820
 not up to the expectations.

1:04:14.820 --> 1:04:18.020
 And so therefore they were replaced, you know,

1:04:18.020 --> 1:04:21.180
 by other things, right?

1:04:21.180 --> 1:04:25.340
 The other one was that completely opposite one,

1:04:25.340 --> 1:04:28.140
 that they were too good.

1:04:28.140 --> 1:04:31.900
 And as a result, they essentially became

1:04:31.900 --> 1:04:33.180
 sort of a household name,

1:04:33.180 --> 1:04:37.100
 and then essentially they got transformed.

1:04:37.100 --> 1:04:40.700
 I mean, in both cases, sort of the outcome was the same.

1:04:40.700 --> 1:04:43.740
 They evolved into something, right?

1:04:43.740 --> 1:04:47.700
 And that's what I, you know, if I look at this, right?

1:04:47.700 --> 1:04:50.180
 So the modern machine learning, right?

1:04:50.180 --> 1:04:51.020
 So.

1:04:51.020 --> 1:04:53.260
 So there's echoes in the modern machine learning.

1:04:53.260 --> 1:04:55.340
 I think so, I think so, because, you know,

1:04:55.340 --> 1:04:59.140
 if you think about this, you know, and how we design,

1:04:59.140 --> 1:05:02.500
 you know, the most successful algorithms,

1:05:02.500 --> 1:05:04.140
 including AlphaFold, right?

1:05:04.140 --> 1:05:08.100
 You built in the knowledge about the domain

1:05:08.100 --> 1:05:09.940
 that you study, right?

1:05:09.940 --> 1:05:12.900
 So you built in your expertise.

1:05:12.900 --> 1:05:14.460
 So speaking of AlphaFold,

1:05:14.460 --> 1:05:18.260
 so DeepMind's AlphaFold 2 recently was announced

1:05:18.260 --> 1:05:21.980
 to have, quote unquote, solved protein folding.

1:05:21.980 --> 1:05:24.220
 But how exciting is this to you?

1:05:24.220 --> 1:05:27.060
 It seems to be one of the,

1:05:27.060 --> 1:05:29.660
 one of the exciting things that have happened in 2020.

1:05:29.660 --> 1:05:32.340
 It's an incredible accomplishment from the looks of it.

1:05:32.340 --> 1:05:33.860
 What part of it is amazing to you?

1:05:33.860 --> 1:05:36.300
 What part would you say is over hype

1:05:36.300 --> 1:05:39.020
 or maybe misunderstood?

1:05:39.020 --> 1:05:41.940
 It's definitely a very exciting achievement.

1:05:41.940 --> 1:05:43.820
 To give you a little bit of perspective, right?

1:05:43.820 --> 1:05:48.820
 So in bioinformatics, we have several competitions.

1:05:50.020 --> 1:05:53.060
 And so the way, you know, you often hear

1:05:53.940 --> 1:05:56.220
 how those competitions have been explained

1:05:56.220 --> 1:05:59.820
 to sort of to non bioinformaticians is that, you know,

1:05:59.820 --> 1:06:01.900
 they call it bioinformatics Olympic games.

1:06:01.900 --> 1:06:03.620
 And there are several disciplines, right?

1:06:03.620 --> 1:06:07.020
 So the historically one of the first one

1:06:07.020 --> 1:06:10.300
 was the discipline in predicting the protein structure,

1:06:10.300 --> 1:06:12.580
 predicting the 3D coordinates of the protein.

1:06:12.580 --> 1:06:13.580
 But there are some others.

1:06:13.580 --> 1:06:16.740
 So the predicting protein functions,

1:06:16.740 --> 1:06:21.460
 predicting effects of mutations on protein functions,

1:06:21.460 --> 1:06:24.900
 then predicting protein, protein interactions.

1:06:24.900 --> 1:06:28.100
 So the original one was CASP

1:06:28.100 --> 1:06:32.020
 or a critical assessment of a protein structure.

1:06:32.020 --> 1:06:37.020
 And the, you know, typically what happens

1:06:40.020 --> 1:06:43.980
 during this competitions is, you know, scientists,

1:06:43.980 --> 1:06:48.380
 experimental scientists solve the structures,

1:06:48.380 --> 1:06:51.700
 but don't put them into the protein data bank,

1:06:51.700 --> 1:06:53.740
 which is the centralized database

1:06:54.700 --> 1:06:57.260
 that contains all the 3D coordinates.

1:06:57.260 --> 1:07:02.260
 Instead, they hold it and release protein sequences.

1:07:02.340 --> 1:07:05.420
 And now the challenge of the community

1:07:05.420 --> 1:07:10.180
 is to predict the 3D structures of this proteins

1:07:10.180 --> 1:07:12.940
 and then use the experimental results structures

1:07:12.940 --> 1:07:16.620
 to assess which one is the closest one, right?

1:07:16.620 --> 1:07:17.740
 And this competition, by the way,

1:07:17.740 --> 1:07:19.540
 just a bunch of different tangents.

1:07:19.540 --> 1:07:22.860
 And maybe you can also say, what is protein folding?

1:07:22.860 --> 1:07:25.020
 Then this competition, CASP competition

1:07:25.020 --> 1:07:27.420
 has become the gold standard.

1:07:27.420 --> 1:07:29.500
 And that's what was used to say

1:07:29.500 --> 1:07:32.420
 that protein folding was solved.

1:07:32.420 --> 1:07:35.300
 So just to add a little, just a bunch.

1:07:35.300 --> 1:07:37.700
 So if you could, whenever you say stuff,

1:07:37.700 --> 1:07:39.380
 maybe throw in some of the basics

1:07:39.380 --> 1:07:41.580
 for the folks that might be outside of the field.

1:07:41.580 --> 1:07:42.740
 Anyway, sorry.

1:07:42.740 --> 1:07:45.900
 So, yeah, so, you know, so the reason it's, you know,

1:07:45.900 --> 1:07:50.260
 it's relevant to our understanding of protein folding

1:07:50.260 --> 1:07:54.180
 is because, you know, we've yet to learn

1:07:54.180 --> 1:07:58.140
 how the folding mechanistically works, right?

1:07:58.140 --> 1:08:00.740
 So there are different hypothesis,

1:08:00.740 --> 1:08:02.780
 what happens to this fold?

1:08:02.780 --> 1:08:07.620
 For example, there is a hypothesis that the folding happens

1:08:07.620 --> 1:08:12.620
 by, you know, also in the modular fashion, right?

1:08:12.660 --> 1:08:16.220
 So that, you know, we have protein domains

1:08:16.220 --> 1:08:17.940
 that get folded independently

1:08:17.940 --> 1:08:19.700
 because their structure is stable.

1:08:19.700 --> 1:08:23.380
 And then the whole protein structure gets formed.

1:08:23.380 --> 1:08:25.380
 But, you know, within those domains,

1:08:25.380 --> 1:08:27.460
 we also have a so called secondary structure,

1:08:27.460 --> 1:08:29.820
 the small alpha helices, beta schists.

1:08:29.820 --> 1:08:34.340
 So these are, you know, elements that are structurally stable.

1:08:34.340 --> 1:08:37.820
 And so, and the question is, you know,

1:08:37.820 --> 1:08:40.340
 when do they get formed?

1:08:40.340 --> 1:08:42.580
 Because some of the secondary structure elements,

1:08:42.580 --> 1:08:46.500
 you have to have, you know, a fragment in the beginning

1:08:46.500 --> 1:08:49.420
 and say the fragment in the middle, right?

1:08:49.420 --> 1:08:54.420
 So you cannot potentially start having the full fold

1:08:54.780 --> 1:08:57.100
 from the get go, right?

1:08:57.100 --> 1:09:00.340
 So it's still, you know, it's still a big enigma,

1:09:00.340 --> 1:09:01.420
 what happens.

1:09:01.420 --> 1:09:04.260
 We know that it's an extremely efficient

1:09:04.260 --> 1:09:05.660
 and stable process, right?

1:09:05.660 --> 1:09:07.660
 So there's this long sequence

1:09:07.660 --> 1:09:09.500
 and the fold happens really quickly.

1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:10.340
 Exactly.

1:09:10.340 --> 1:09:11.180
 So that's really weird, right?

1:09:11.180 --> 1:09:15.340
 And it happens like the same way almost every time.

1:09:15.340 --> 1:09:16.380
 Exactly, exactly.

1:09:16.380 --> 1:09:17.860
 That's really weird.

1:09:17.860 --> 1:09:19.060
 That's freaking weird.

1:09:19.060 --> 1:09:22.900
 It's, yeah, that's why it's such an amazing thing.

1:09:22.900 --> 1:09:24.300
 But most importantly, right?

1:09:24.300 --> 1:09:27.460
 So it's, you know, so when you see the, you know,

1:09:27.460 --> 1:09:29.260
 the translation process, right?

1:09:29.260 --> 1:09:34.260
 So when you don't have the whole protein translated,

1:09:36.100 --> 1:09:37.860
 right, it's still being translated,

1:09:37.860 --> 1:09:41.180
 you know, getting out from the ribosome,

1:09:41.180 --> 1:09:45.780
 you already see some structural, you know, fragmentation.

1:09:45.780 --> 1:09:49.300
 So folding starts happening

1:09:49.300 --> 1:09:52.780
 before the whole protein gets produced, right?

1:09:52.780 --> 1:09:55.060
 And so this is obviously, you know,

1:09:55.060 --> 1:09:59.220
 one of the biggest questions in, you know,

1:09:59.220 --> 1:10:00.980
 in modern molecular biologists.

1:10:00.980 --> 1:10:04.180
 Not like maybe what happens,

1:10:04.180 --> 1:10:07.860
 like that's not as bigger than the question of folding.

1:10:07.860 --> 1:10:09.540
 That's the question of like,

1:10:09.540 --> 1:10:12.460
 something like deeper fundamental idea of folding.

1:10:12.460 --> 1:10:13.380
 Yes. Behind folding.

1:10:13.380 --> 1:10:14.620
 Exactly, exactly.

1:10:14.620 --> 1:10:19.620
 So, you know, so obviously if we are able to predict

1:10:21.340 --> 1:10:24.060
 the end product of protein folding,

1:10:24.060 --> 1:10:27.660
 we are one step closer to understanding

1:10:27.660 --> 1:10:30.220
 sort of the mechanisms of the protein folding.

1:10:30.220 --> 1:10:34.700
 Because we can then potentially look and start probing

1:10:34.700 --> 1:10:38.260
 what are the critical parts of this process

1:10:38.260 --> 1:10:41.260
 and what are not so critical parts of this process.

1:10:41.260 --> 1:10:44.420
 So we can start decomposing this, you know,

1:10:44.420 --> 1:10:49.420
 so in a way this protein structure prediction algorithm

1:10:50.100 --> 1:10:53.700
 can be used as a tool, right?

1:10:53.700 --> 1:10:58.700
 So you change the, you know, you modify the protein,

1:10:59.220 --> 1:11:02.380
 you get back to this tool, it predicts,

1:11:02.380 --> 1:11:04.940
 okay, it's completely unstable.

1:11:04.940 --> 1:11:07.820
 Yeah, which aspects of the input

1:11:07.820 --> 1:11:09.860
 will have a big impact on the output?

1:11:09.860 --> 1:11:11.140
 Exactly, exactly.

1:11:11.140 --> 1:11:13.340
 So what happens is, you know,

1:11:13.340 --> 1:11:18.340
 we typically have some sort of incremental advancement,

1:11:18.700 --> 1:11:22.580
 you know, each stage of this CASP competition,

1:11:22.580 --> 1:11:25.340
 you have groups with incremental advancement

1:11:25.340 --> 1:11:29.860
 and, you know, historically the top performing groups

1:11:29.860 --> 1:11:34.420
 were, you know, they were not using machine learning.

1:11:34.420 --> 1:11:37.700
 They were using a very advanced biophysics

1:11:37.700 --> 1:11:39.620
 combined with bioinformatics,

1:11:39.620 --> 1:11:43.220
 combined with, you know, the data mining

1:11:43.220 --> 1:11:47.380
 and that was, you know, that would enable them

1:11:47.380 --> 1:11:52.380
 to obtain protein structures of those proteins

1:11:52.660 --> 1:11:57.540
 that don't have any structurally solved relatives

1:11:57.540 --> 1:12:01.860
 because, you know, if we have another protein,

1:12:01.860 --> 1:12:05.640
 say the same protein, but coming from a different species,

1:12:07.500 --> 1:12:10.460
 we could potentially derive some ideas

1:12:10.460 --> 1:12:13.220
 and that's so called homology or comparative modeling,

1:12:13.220 --> 1:12:15.300
 where we'll derive some ideas

1:12:15.300 --> 1:12:17.540
 from the previously known structures

1:12:17.540 --> 1:12:19.860
 and that would help us tremendously

1:12:19.860 --> 1:12:24.860
 in, you know, in reconstructing the 3D structure overall.

1:12:25.380 --> 1:12:27.900
 But what happens when we don't have these relatives?

1:12:27.900 --> 1:12:31.220
 This is when it becomes really, really hard, right?

1:12:31.220 --> 1:12:35.260
 So that's so called de novo, you know,

1:12:35.260 --> 1:12:37.500
 de novo protein structure prediction.

1:12:37.500 --> 1:12:42.500
 And in this case, those methods were traditionally very good.

1:12:43.060 --> 1:12:46.300
 But what happened in the last year,

1:12:46.300 --> 1:12:49.460
 the original alpha fold came into

1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:55.640
 and all of a sudden it's much better than everyone else.

1:12:56.420 --> 1:12:57.900
 This is 2018.

1:12:57.900 --> 1:12:58.740
 Yeah.

1:12:58.740 --> 1:13:02.140
 Oh, and the competition is only every two years, I think.

1:13:02.140 --> 1:13:07.140
 And then, so, you know, it was sort of kind of over shockwave

1:13:08.060 --> 1:13:10.740
 to the bioinformatics community that, you know,

1:13:10.740 --> 1:13:15.440
 we have like a state of the art machine learning system

1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:18.460
 that does, you know, structure prediction.

1:13:18.460 --> 1:13:20.780
 And essentially what it does, you know,

1:13:20.780 --> 1:13:25.780
 so if you look at this, it actually predicts the context.

1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:29.460
 So, you know, so the process of reconstructing

1:13:29.460 --> 1:13:34.460
 the 3D structure starts by predicting the context

1:13:34.700 --> 1:13:38.860
 between the different parts of the protein.

1:13:38.860 --> 1:13:40.980
 And the context essentially is the parts of the proteins

1:13:40.980 --> 1:13:43.240
 that are in a close proximity to each other.

1:13:43.240 --> 1:13:45.820
 Right, so actually the machine learning part

1:13:45.820 --> 1:13:50.820
 seems to be estimating, you can correct me if I'm wrong here,

1:13:51.080 --> 1:13:53.180
 but it seems to be estimating the distance matrix,

1:13:53.180 --> 1:13:55.900
 which is like the distance between the different parts.

1:13:55.900 --> 1:13:58.080
 Yeah, so we call the contact map.

1:13:58.080 --> 1:13:58.920
 Contact map.

1:13:58.920 --> 1:14:00.580
 So once you have the contact map,

1:14:00.580 --> 1:14:04.860
 the reconstruction is becoming more straightforward, right?

1:14:04.860 --> 1:14:06.780
 But so the contact map is the key.

1:14:06.780 --> 1:14:11.260
 And so, you know, so that what happened.

1:14:11.260 --> 1:14:15.980
 And now we started seeing in this current stage, right?

1:14:15.980 --> 1:14:18.500
 Well, in the most recent one,

1:14:18.500 --> 1:14:22.020
 we started seeing the emergence of these ideas

1:14:22.020 --> 1:14:25.080
 in other people works, right?

1:14:25.080 --> 1:14:29.500
 But yet here's, you know, AlphaFold2

1:14:29.500 --> 1:14:33.380
 that again outperforms everyone else.

1:14:33.380 --> 1:14:35.780
 And also by introducing yet another wave

1:14:35.780 --> 1:14:38.620
 of the machine learning ideas.

1:14:38.620 --> 1:14:41.260
 Yeah, there don't seem to be also an incorporation.

1:14:41.260 --> 1:14:43.040
 First of all, the paper is not out yet,

1:14:43.040 --> 1:14:44.860
 but there's a bunch of ideas already out.

1:14:44.860 --> 1:14:48.100
 There does seem to be an incorporation of this other thing.

1:14:48.100 --> 1:14:50.160
 I don't know if it's something that you could speak to,

1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:55.160
 which is like the incorporation of like other structures,

1:14:58.200 --> 1:15:01.720
 like evolutionary similar structures

1:15:01.720 --> 1:15:03.820
 that are used to kind of give you hints.

1:15:03.820 --> 1:15:08.360
 Yes, so evolutionary similarity is something

1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:10.740
 that we can detect at different levels, right?

1:15:10.740 --> 1:15:12.860
 So we know, for example,

1:15:12.860 --> 1:15:17.140
 that the structure of proteins

1:15:17.140 --> 1:15:20.520
 is more conserved than the sequence.

1:15:20.520 --> 1:15:22.340
 The sequence could be very different,

1:15:22.340 --> 1:15:26.300
 but the structural shape is actually still very conserved.

1:15:26.300 --> 1:15:28.880
 So that's sort of the intrinsic property that, you know,

1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:31.140
 in a way related to protein folds,

1:15:31.140 --> 1:15:34.140
 you know, to the evolution of the, you know,

1:15:34.140 --> 1:15:37.820
 of the proteins and protein domains, et cetera.

1:15:37.820 --> 1:15:41.060
 But we know that, I mean, there've been multiple studies.

1:15:41.060 --> 1:15:45.340
 And, you know, ideally, if you have structures,

1:15:45.340 --> 1:15:48.580
 you know, you should use that information.

1:15:48.580 --> 1:15:51.220
 However, sometimes we don't have this information.

1:15:51.220 --> 1:15:53.220
 Instead, we have a bunch of sequences.

1:15:53.220 --> 1:15:54.860
 Sequences, we have a lot, right?

1:15:54.860 --> 1:15:59.860
 So we have, you know, hundreds, thousands

1:16:00.340 --> 1:16:04.300
 of, you know, different organisms sequenced, right?

1:16:04.300 --> 1:16:06.980
 And by taking the same protein,

1:16:07.840 --> 1:16:11.620
 but in different organisms and aligning it,

1:16:11.620 --> 1:16:15.980
 so making it, you know, making the corresponding positions

1:16:15.980 --> 1:16:20.500
 aligned, we can actually say a lot

1:16:20.500 --> 1:16:24.220
 about sort of what is conserved in this protein

1:16:24.220 --> 1:16:26.920
 and therefore, you know, structurally more stable,

1:16:26.920 --> 1:16:28.920
 what is diverse in this protein.

1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:32.380
 So on top of that, we could provide sort of the information

1:16:32.380 --> 1:16:35.100
 about the sort of the secondary structure

1:16:35.100 --> 1:16:36.420
 of this protein, et cetera, et cetera.

1:16:36.420 --> 1:16:38.980
 So this information is extremely useful

1:16:39.940 --> 1:16:41.300
 and it's already there.

1:16:41.300 --> 1:16:44.140
 So while it's tempting to, you know,

1:16:44.140 --> 1:16:46.060
 to do a complete ab initio,

1:16:46.060 --> 1:16:49.540
 so you just have a protein sequence and nothing else,

1:16:49.540 --> 1:16:54.220
 the reality is such that we are overwhelmed with this data.

1:16:54.220 --> 1:16:55.520
 So why not use it?

1:16:56.500 --> 1:16:59.220
 And so, yeah, so I'm looking forward

1:16:59.220 --> 1:17:01.500
 to reading this paper.

1:17:01.500 --> 1:17:03.420
 It does seem to, like they've,

1:17:03.420 --> 1:17:05.100
 in the previous version of Alpha Fold,

1:17:05.100 --> 1:17:09.780
 they didn't, for this evolutionary similarity thing,

1:17:09.780 --> 1:17:12.040
 they didn't use machine learning for that.

1:17:12.960 --> 1:17:15.600
 Or rather, they used it as like the input

1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:17.880
 to the entirety of the neural net,

1:17:17.880 --> 1:17:22.020
 like the features derived from the similarity.

1:17:22.020 --> 1:17:24.660
 It seems like there's some kind of quote, unquote,

1:17:24.660 --> 1:17:29.660
 iterative thing where it seems to be part of the learning

1:17:30.500 --> 1:17:34.260
 process is the incorporation of this evolutionary similarity.

1:17:34.260 --> 1:17:36.940
 Yeah, I don't think there is a bioarchive paper, right?

1:17:36.940 --> 1:17:37.780
 There's nothing.

1:17:37.780 --> 1:17:38.620
 No, there's nothing.

1:17:38.620 --> 1:17:40.680
 There's a blog post that's written

1:17:40.680 --> 1:17:42.600
 by a marketing team, essentially,

1:17:42.600 --> 1:17:46.600
 which, you know, it has some scientific similarity,

1:17:48.420 --> 1:17:51.780
 probably, to the actual methodology used,

1:17:51.780 --> 1:17:55.220
 but it could be, it's like interpreting scripture.

1:17:55.220 --> 1:17:59.660
 It could be just poetic interpretations of the actual work

1:17:59.660 --> 1:18:01.900
 as opposed to direct connection to the work.

1:18:01.900 --> 1:18:04.260
 So now, speaking about protein folding, right?

1:18:04.260 --> 1:18:06.820
 So, you know, in order to answer the question

1:18:06.820 --> 1:18:09.460
 whether or not we have solved this, right?

1:18:09.460 --> 1:18:13.580
 So we need to go back to the beginning of our conversation

1:18:13.580 --> 1:18:16.100
 with the realization that an average protein

1:18:16.100 --> 1:18:21.100
 is that typically what the CASP has been focusing on

1:18:22.180 --> 1:18:25.820
 is this competition has been focusing

1:18:25.820 --> 1:18:29.220
 on the single, maybe two domain proteins

1:18:29.220 --> 1:18:31.060
 that are still very compact.

1:18:31.060 --> 1:18:35.400
 And even those ones are extremely challenging to solve.

1:18:35.400 --> 1:18:37.660
 But now we talk about, you know,

1:18:37.660 --> 1:18:42.420
 an average protein that has two, three protein domains.

1:18:42.420 --> 1:18:46.920
 If you look at the proteins that are in charge

1:18:46.920 --> 1:18:51.120
 of the, you know, of the process with the neural system,

1:18:51.120 --> 1:18:56.120
 right, perhaps one of the most recently evolved

1:18:58.500 --> 1:19:03.500
 sort of systems in an organism, right?

1:19:03.500 --> 1:19:06.360
 All of them, well, the majority of them

1:19:06.360 --> 1:19:09.000
 are highly multi domain proteins.

1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:13.520
 So they are, you know, some of them have five, six, seven,

1:19:13.520 --> 1:19:16.840
 you know, and more domains, right?

1:19:16.840 --> 1:19:20.000
 And, you know, we are very far away

1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:22.400
 from understanding how these proteins are folded.

1:19:22.400 --> 1:19:24.440
 So the complexity of the protein matters here.

1:19:24.440 --> 1:19:27.920
 The complexity of the protein modules

1:19:27.920 --> 1:19:30.220
 or the protein domains.

1:19:30.220 --> 1:19:35.220
 So you're saying solved, so the definition

1:19:35.220 --> 1:19:38.620
 of solved here is particularly the CASP competition

1:19:38.620 --> 1:19:41.760
 achieving human level, not human level,

1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:45.620
 achieving experimental level performance

1:19:45.620 --> 1:19:48.520
 on these particular sets of proteins

1:19:48.520 --> 1:19:50.300
 that have been used in these competitions.

1:19:50.300 --> 1:19:54.740
 Well, I mean, you know, I do think that, you know,

1:19:54.740 --> 1:19:57.500
 especially with regards to the alpha fold,

1:19:57.500 --> 1:20:02.500
 you know, it is able to, you know, to solve,

1:20:03.020 --> 1:20:07.360
 you know, at the near experimental level,

1:20:08.980 --> 1:20:13.980
 pre big majority of the more compact proteins

1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:16.360
 like, or protein domains.

1:20:16.360 --> 1:20:18.740
 Because again, in order to understand

1:20:18.740 --> 1:20:22.800
 how the overall protein, you know,

1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:26.220
 multi domain protein fold, we do need to understand

1:20:26.220 --> 1:20:28.760
 the structure of its individual domains.

1:20:28.760 --> 1:20:31.140
 I mean, unlike if you look at alpha zero

1:20:31.140 --> 1:20:36.140
 or like even mu zero, if you look at that work,

1:20:36.500 --> 1:20:39.540
 you know, it's nice reinforcement learning

1:20:39.540 --> 1:20:41.100
 self playing mechanisms are nice

1:20:41.100 --> 1:20:42.380
 cause it's all in simulation.

1:20:42.380 --> 1:20:45.920
 So you can learn from just huge amounts.

1:20:45.920 --> 1:20:47.340
 Like you don't need data.

1:20:47.340 --> 1:20:49.740
 It was like the problem with proteins,

1:20:49.740 --> 1:20:54.540
 like the size, I forget how many 3D structures

1:20:54.540 --> 1:20:56.980
 have been mapped, but the training data is very small.

1:20:56.980 --> 1:20:59.060
 No matter what, it's like millions,

1:20:59.060 --> 1:21:01.400
 maybe a one or two million or something like that,

1:21:01.400 --> 1:21:02.940
 but it's some very small number,

1:21:02.940 --> 1:21:06.820
 but like, it doesn't seem like that's scalable.

1:21:06.820 --> 1:21:09.380
 There has to be, I don't know,

1:21:09.380 --> 1:21:13.100
 it feels like you want to somehow 10 X the data

1:21:13.100 --> 1:21:15.700
 or a hundred X the data somehow.

1:21:15.700 --> 1:21:20.700
 Yes, but we also can take advantage of homology models,

1:21:20.700 --> 1:21:25.700
 right, so the models that are of very good quality

1:21:26.740 --> 1:21:30.660
 because they are essentially obtained

1:21:30.660 --> 1:21:33.720
 based on the evolutionary information, right?

1:21:33.720 --> 1:21:38.540
 So you can, there is a potential to enhance this information

1:21:38.540 --> 1:21:43.540
 and, you know, use it again to empower the training set.

1:21:43.540 --> 1:21:48.540
 And it's, I think, I am actually very optimistic.

1:21:49.780 --> 1:21:54.780
 I think it's been one of this sort of, you know,

1:21:58.100 --> 1:22:03.100
 churning events where you have a system that is,

1:22:05.220 --> 1:22:07.300
 you know, a machine learning system

1:22:07.300 --> 1:22:12.300
 that is truly better than the machine learning system.

1:22:12.300 --> 1:22:15.740
 Better than the sort of the more conventional

1:22:15.740 --> 1:22:17.940
 biophysics based methods.

1:22:17.940 --> 1:22:19.380
 That's a huge leap.

1:22:19.380 --> 1:22:21.280
 This is one of those fun questions,

1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:26.280
 but where would you put it in the ranking

1:22:26.720 --> 1:22:28.540
 of the greatest breakthroughs

1:22:28.540 --> 1:22:30.480
 in artificial intelligence history?

1:22:31.740 --> 1:22:34.940
 So like, okay, so let's see who's in the running.

1:22:34.940 --> 1:22:35.860
 Maybe you can correct me.

1:22:35.860 --> 1:22:39.900
 So you got like AlphaZero and AlphaGo

1:22:39.900 --> 1:22:44.500
 beating the world champion at the game of Go.

1:22:44.500 --> 1:22:48.220
 Thought to be impossible like 20 years ago.

1:22:48.220 --> 1:22:51.340
 Or at least the AI community was highly skeptical.

1:22:51.340 --> 1:22:55.060
 Then you got like also Deep Blue original Kasparov.

1:22:55.060 --> 1:22:56.260
 You have deep learning itself,

1:22:56.260 --> 1:22:58.280
 like the maybe, what would you say,

1:22:58.280 --> 1:23:00.940
 the AlexNet, ImageNet moment.

1:23:00.940 --> 1:23:02.780
 So the first neural network

1:23:02.780 --> 1:23:04.780
 achieving human level performance.

1:23:04.780 --> 1:23:07.860
 Super, that's not true.

1:23:07.860 --> 1:23:10.980
 Achieving like a big leap in performance

1:23:10.980 --> 1:23:12.720
 on the computer vision problem.

1:23:14.420 --> 1:23:18.980
 There is OpenAI, the whole like GPT3,

1:23:18.980 --> 1:23:23.020
 that whole space of transformers and language models

1:23:23.020 --> 1:23:27.120
 just achieving this incredible performance

1:23:27.120 --> 1:23:30.200
 of application of neural networks to language models.

1:23:31.780 --> 1:23:33.540
 Boston Dynamics, pretty cool.

1:23:33.540 --> 1:23:35.220
 Like robotics.

1:23:35.220 --> 1:23:38.200
 People are like, there's no AI.

1:23:38.200 --> 1:23:41.520
 No, no, there's no machine learning currently.

1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:44.520
 But AI is much bigger than machine learning.

1:23:44.520 --> 1:23:48.860
 So that just the engineering aspect,

1:23:48.860 --> 1:23:50.780
 I would say it's one of the greatest accomplishments

1:23:50.780 --> 1:23:52.860
 in engineering side.

1:23:52.860 --> 1:23:56.140
 Engineering meaning like mechanical engineering

1:23:56.140 --> 1:23:57.980
 of robotics ever.

1:23:57.980 --> 1:23:59.500
 Then of course, autonomous vehicles.

1:23:59.500 --> 1:24:01.300
 You can argue for Waymo,

1:24:01.300 --> 1:24:03.580
 which is like the Google self driving car.

1:24:03.580 --> 1:24:05.460
 Or you can argue for Tesla,

1:24:05.460 --> 1:24:07.860
 which is like actually being used

1:24:07.860 --> 1:24:10.740
 by hundreds of thousands of people on the road today,

1:24:10.740 --> 1:24:12.000
 machine learning system.

1:24:13.700 --> 1:24:17.560
 And I don't know if you can, what else is there?

1:24:17.560 --> 1:24:18.700
 But I think that's it.

1:24:18.700 --> 1:24:20.900
 And then AlphaFold, many people are saying

1:24:20.900 --> 1:24:23.300
 is up there, potentially number one.

1:24:23.300 --> 1:24:24.820
 Would you put them at number one?

1:24:24.820 --> 1:24:29.820
 Well, in terms of the impact on the science

1:24:29.820 --> 1:24:34.060
 and on the society beyond, it's definitely,

1:24:34.060 --> 1:24:35.820
 to me would be one of the...

1:24:37.460 --> 1:24:39.060
 Top three?

1:24:39.060 --> 1:24:39.900
 What you want?

1:24:39.900 --> 1:24:43.020
 Maybe, I mean, I'm probably not the best person

1:24:43.020 --> 1:24:45.460
 to answer that.

1:24:45.460 --> 1:24:50.460
 But I do have, I remember my,

1:24:51.540 --> 1:24:56.380
 back in, I think 1997, when Deep Blue,

1:24:56.380 --> 1:25:01.380
 that Kasparov, it was, I mean, it was a shock.

1:25:01.860 --> 1:25:04.180
 I mean, it was, and I think for the,

1:25:04.180 --> 1:25:09.180
 for the pre substantial part of the world,

1:25:14.220 --> 1:25:19.220
 that especially people who have some experience with chess,

1:25:21.740 --> 1:25:25.660
 and realizing how incredibly human this game,

1:25:25.660 --> 1:25:30.220
 how much of a brain power you need

1:25:30.220 --> 1:25:35.220
 to reach those levels of grandmasters, right, level.

1:25:36.020 --> 1:25:37.920
 And it's probably one of the first time,

1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:39.780
 and how good Kasparov was.

1:25:39.780 --> 1:25:42.300
 And again, yeah, so Kasparov's arguably

1:25:42.300 --> 1:25:45.580
 one of the best ever, right?

1:25:45.580 --> 1:25:47.860
 And you get a machine that beats him.

1:25:47.860 --> 1:25:48.820
 All right, so it's...

1:25:48.820 --> 1:25:50.740
 First time a machine probably beat a human

1:25:50.740 --> 1:25:53.720
 at that scale of a thing, of anything.

1:25:53.720 --> 1:25:54.740
 Yes, yes.

1:25:54.740 --> 1:25:57.220
 So that was, to me, that was like, you know,

1:25:57.220 --> 1:26:00.620
 one of the groundbreaking events in the history of AI.

1:26:00.620 --> 1:26:02.340
 Yeah, that's probably number one.

1:26:02.340 --> 1:26:05.460
 Probably, like we don't, it's hard to remember.

1:26:05.460 --> 1:26:08.100
 It's like Muhammad Ali versus, I don't know,

1:26:08.100 --> 1:26:09.900
 any of the Mike Tyson, something like that.

1:26:09.900 --> 1:26:12.740
 It's like, nah, you gotta put Muhammad Ali at number one.

1:26:13.660 --> 1:26:15.300
 Same with Deep Blue,

1:26:15.300 --> 1:26:17.980
 even though it's not machine learning based.

1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:21.540
 Still, it uses advanced search,

1:26:21.540 --> 1:26:24.420
 and search is the integral part of AI, right?

1:26:24.420 --> 1:26:27.660
 It's not, people don't think of it that way at this moment.

1:26:27.660 --> 1:26:30.900
 In vogue currently, search is not seen

1:26:30.900 --> 1:26:34.220
 as a fundamental aspect of intelligence,

1:26:34.220 --> 1:26:37.700
 but it very well, I mean, it very likely is.

1:26:37.700 --> 1:26:39.660
 In fact, I mean, that's what neural networks are,

1:26:39.660 --> 1:26:41.260
 is they're just performing search

1:26:41.260 --> 1:26:43.980
 on the space of parameters, and it's all search.

1:26:45.540 --> 1:26:47.740
 All of intelligence is some form of search,

1:26:47.740 --> 1:26:49.660
 and you just have to become cleverer and clever

1:26:49.660 --> 1:26:50.900
 at that search problem.

1:26:50.900 --> 1:26:53.980
 And I also have another one that you didn't mention

1:26:53.980 --> 1:26:58.260
 that's one of my favorite ones is,

1:26:58.260 --> 1:26:59.860
 so you've probably heard of this,

1:26:59.860 --> 1:27:03.420
 it's, I think it's called Deep Rembrandt.

1:27:03.420 --> 1:27:06.820
 It's the project where they trained,

1:27:06.820 --> 1:27:08.220
 I think there was a collaboration

1:27:08.220 --> 1:27:11.580
 between the sort of the experts

1:27:11.580 --> 1:27:15.500
 in Rembrandt painting in Netherlands,

1:27:15.500 --> 1:27:18.300
 and a group, an artificial intelligence group,

1:27:18.300 --> 1:27:20.220
 where they train an algorithm

1:27:20.220 --> 1:27:22.980
 to replicate the style of the Rembrandt,

1:27:22.980 --> 1:27:26.980
 and they actually printed a portrait

1:27:26.980 --> 1:27:31.180
 that never existed before in the style of Rembrandt.

1:27:32.620 --> 1:27:36.740
 I think they printed it on a sort of,

1:27:36.740 --> 1:27:38.500
 on the canvas that, you know,

1:27:38.500 --> 1:27:42.580
 using pretty much same types of paints and stuff.

1:27:42.580 --> 1:27:44.060
 To me, it was mind blowing.

1:27:44.060 --> 1:27:46.900
 Yeah, and the space of art, that's interesting.

1:27:46.900 --> 1:27:50.100
 There hasn't been, maybe that's it,

1:27:50.100 --> 1:27:54.580
 but I think there hasn't been an image in that moment yet

1:27:54.580 --> 1:27:55.840
 in the space of art.

1:27:56.780 --> 1:27:58.620
 You haven't been able to achieve

1:27:58.620 --> 1:28:01.420
 superhuman level performance in the space of art,

1:28:01.420 --> 1:28:04.660
 even though there's this big famous thing

1:28:04.660 --> 1:28:07.660
 where a piece of art was purchased,

1:28:07.660 --> 1:28:08.700
 I guess for a lot of money.

1:28:08.700 --> 1:28:09.540
 Yes.

1:28:09.540 --> 1:28:11.660
 Yeah, but it's still, you know,

1:28:11.660 --> 1:28:14.060
 people are like in the space of music at least,

1:28:15.620 --> 1:28:19.740
 that's, you know, it's clear that human created pieces

1:28:19.740 --> 1:28:21.700
 are much more popular.

1:28:21.700 --> 1:28:24.420
 So there hasn't been a moment where it's like,

1:28:24.420 --> 1:28:26.700
 oh, this is, we're now,

1:28:26.700 --> 1:28:28.780
 I would say in the space of music,

1:28:28.780 --> 1:28:30.140
 what makes a lot of money,

1:28:30.140 --> 1:28:32.100
 we're talking about serious money,

1:28:32.100 --> 1:28:35.300
 it's music and movies, or like shows and so on,

1:28:35.300 --> 1:28:36.640
 and entertainment.

1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:40.020
 There hasn't been a moment where AI created,

1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:44.460
 AI was able to create a piece of music

1:28:44.460 --> 1:28:49.460
 or a piece of cinema, like Netflix show,

1:28:49.820 --> 1:28:53.540
 that is, you know, that's sufficiently popular

1:28:53.540 --> 1:28:55.260
 to make a ton of money.

1:28:55.260 --> 1:28:56.100
 Yeah.

1:28:56.100 --> 1:28:58.940
 And that moment would be very, very powerful,

1:28:58.940 --> 1:29:01.560
 because that's like, that's an AI system

1:29:01.560 --> 1:29:03.060
 being used to make a lot of money.

1:29:03.060 --> 1:29:05.480
 And like direct, of course, AI tools,

1:29:05.480 --> 1:29:07.140
 like even Premiere, audio editing,

1:29:07.140 --> 1:29:08.780
 all the editing, everything I do,

1:29:08.780 --> 1:29:11.660
 to edit this podcast, there's a lot of AI involved.

1:29:11.660 --> 1:29:13.260
 Actually, this is a program,

1:29:13.260 --> 1:29:15.540
 I wanna talk to those folks, just cause I wanna nerd out,

1:29:15.540 --> 1:29:18.060
 it's called iZotope, I don't know if you're familiar with it.

1:29:18.060 --> 1:29:20.140
 They have a bunch of tools of audio processing,

1:29:20.140 --> 1:29:23.080
 and they have, I think they're Boston based,

1:29:23.080 --> 1:29:26.380
 just, it's so exciting to me to use it,

1:29:26.380 --> 1:29:28.200
 like on the audio here,

1:29:28.200 --> 1:29:30.380
 cause it's all machine learning.

1:29:30.380 --> 1:29:35.380
 It's not, cause most audio production stuff

1:29:35.780 --> 1:29:37.540
 is like any kind of processing you do,

1:29:37.540 --> 1:29:39.500
 it's very basic signal processing,

1:29:39.500 --> 1:29:41.980
 and you're tuning knobs and so on.

1:29:41.980 --> 1:29:43.580
 They have all of that, of course,

1:29:43.580 --> 1:29:46.020
 but they also have all of this machine learning stuff,

1:29:46.020 --> 1:29:48.520
 like where you actually give it training data,

1:29:48.520 --> 1:29:51.740
 you select parts of the audio you train on,

1:29:51.740 --> 1:29:56.380
 you train on it, and it figures stuff out.

1:29:56.380 --> 1:29:58.060
 It's great, it's able to detect,

1:29:59.020 --> 1:30:01.380
 like the ability of it to be able

1:30:01.380 --> 1:30:04.820
 to separate voice and music, for example,

1:30:04.820 --> 1:30:07.260
 or voice and anything, is incredible.

1:30:07.260 --> 1:30:11.140
 Like it just, it's clearly exceptionally good

1:30:11.140 --> 1:30:14.940
 at applying these different neural networks models

1:30:14.940 --> 1:30:17.740
 to just separate the different kinds

1:30:17.740 --> 1:30:19.180
 of signals from the audio.

1:30:19.180 --> 1:30:22.260
 That, okay, so that's really exciting.

1:30:22.260 --> 1:30:24.580
 Photoshop, Adobe people also use it,

1:30:24.580 --> 1:30:28.260
 but to generate a piece of music

1:30:28.260 --> 1:30:31.980
 that will sell millions, a piece of art, yeah.

1:30:31.980 --> 1:30:34.420
 No, I agree, and you know, it's,

1:30:34.420 --> 1:30:39.220
 that's, you know, as I mentioned,

1:30:39.220 --> 1:30:41.700
 I offer my AI class, and you know,

1:30:41.700 --> 1:30:44.660
 an integral part of this is the project, right?

1:30:44.660 --> 1:30:47.340
 So it's my favorite, ultimate favorite part,

1:30:47.340 --> 1:30:51.380
 because it typically, we have these project presentations

1:30:51.380 --> 1:30:53.720
 the last two weeks of the classes,

1:30:53.720 --> 1:30:56.220
 right before, you know, the Christmas break,

1:30:56.220 --> 1:31:00.300
 and it's sort of, it adds this cool excitement,

1:31:00.300 --> 1:31:02.660
 and every time, I mean, I'm amazed, you know,

1:31:02.660 --> 1:31:07.660
 with some projects that people, you know, come up with.

1:31:07.660 --> 1:31:12.060
 And so, and quite a few of them are actually, you know,

1:31:12.060 --> 1:31:17.060
 they have some link to arts.

1:31:17.060 --> 1:31:21.260
 I mean, you know, I think last year we had a group

1:31:21.260 --> 1:31:26.260
 who designed an AI producing hokus, Japanese poems.

1:31:27.660 --> 1:31:28.500
 Oh, wow.

1:31:29.380 --> 1:31:31.820
 So, and some of them, so, you know,

1:31:31.820 --> 1:31:34.780
 it got trained on the English based,

1:31:34.780 --> 1:31:36.460
 haikus, haikus, right?

1:31:36.460 --> 1:31:40.260
 So, and some of them, you know,

1:31:40.260 --> 1:31:43.460
 they get to present, like, the top selection.

1:31:43.460 --> 1:31:44.300
 They were pretty good.

1:31:44.300 --> 1:31:47.020
 I mean, you know, I mean, of course, I'm not a specialist,

1:31:47.020 --> 1:31:49.700
 but you read them, and you see this is real.

1:31:49.700 --> 1:31:50.660
 It seems profound.

1:31:50.660 --> 1:31:52.780
 Yes, yeah, it seems real.

1:31:52.780 --> 1:31:54.060
 So it's kind of cool.

1:31:55.060 --> 1:31:57.940
 We also had a couple of projects where people tried

1:31:57.940 --> 1:32:02.940
 to teach AI how to play, like, rock music, classical music.

1:32:02.940 --> 1:32:05.940
 I think, and popular music.

1:32:05.940 --> 1:32:06.780
 Yeah.

1:32:07.820 --> 1:32:10.620
 Interestingly enough, you know,

1:32:10.620 --> 1:32:14.580
 classical music was among the most difficult ones.

1:32:14.580 --> 1:32:15.420
 Oh, sure.

1:32:15.420 --> 1:32:20.420
 And, you know, of course, if you, if, you know,

1:32:21.780 --> 1:32:23.780
 you know, if you look at the, you know,

1:32:23.780 --> 1:32:28.780
 the, like, grandmasters of music, like Bach, right?

1:32:28.780 --> 1:32:31.940
 So there is a lot of, there is a lot of,

1:32:31.940 --> 1:32:34.820
 there is a lot of almost math.

1:32:34.820 --> 1:32:36.580
 Yeah, well, he's very mathematical.

1:32:36.580 --> 1:32:37.420
 Yeah, exactly.

1:32:37.420 --> 1:32:41.500
 So this is, I would imagine that at least some style

1:32:41.500 --> 1:32:43.820
 of this music could be picked up,

1:32:43.820 --> 1:32:46.980
 but then you have this completely different spectrum

1:32:46.980 --> 1:32:49.260
 of classical composers.

1:32:49.260 --> 1:32:54.140
 And so, you know, it's almost like, you know,

1:32:54.140 --> 1:32:56.780
 you don't have to sort of look at the data.

1:32:56.780 --> 1:33:01.140
 You just listen to it and say, nah, that's not it, not yet.

1:33:01.140 --> 1:33:02.380
 That's not it, yeah.

1:33:02.380 --> 1:33:03.340
 That's how I feel too.

1:33:03.340 --> 1:33:05.820
 There's OpenAI has, I think, OpenMuse

1:33:05.820 --> 1:33:07.540
 or something like that, the system.

1:33:07.540 --> 1:33:09.740
 It's cool, but it's like, eh,

1:33:09.740 --> 1:33:12.060
 it's not compelling for some reason.

1:33:12.060 --> 1:33:14.180
 It could be a psychological reason too.

1:33:14.180 --> 1:33:17.580
 Maybe we need to have a human being,

1:33:17.580 --> 1:33:19.660
 a tortured soul behind the music.

1:33:19.660 --> 1:33:20.700
 I don't know.

1:33:20.700 --> 1:33:22.220
 Yeah, no, absolutely.

1:33:22.220 --> 1:33:23.940
 I completely agree.

1:33:23.940 --> 1:33:26.580
 But yeah, whether or not we'll have,

1:33:26.580 --> 1:33:29.140
 one day we'll have, you know,

1:33:29.140 --> 1:33:33.340
 a song written by an AI engine

1:33:33.340 --> 1:33:37.980
 to be like in top charts, musical charts,

1:33:37.980 --> 1:33:39.300
 I wouldn't be surprised.

1:33:40.540 --> 1:33:41.740
 I wouldn't be surprised.

1:33:43.380 --> 1:33:44.700
 I wonder if we already have one

1:33:44.700 --> 1:33:46.380
 and it just hasn't been announced.

1:33:48.020 --> 1:33:49.980
 We wouldn't know.

1:33:49.980 --> 1:33:53.940
 How hard is the multi protein folding problem?

1:33:53.940 --> 1:33:57.100
 Is that kind of something you've already mentioned

1:33:57.100 --> 1:33:59.180
 which is baked into this idea of greater

1:33:59.180 --> 1:34:01.180
 and greater complexity of proteins?

1:34:01.180 --> 1:34:03.300
 Like multi domain proteins,

1:34:03.300 --> 1:34:08.300
 is that basically become multi protein complexes?

1:34:08.940 --> 1:34:10.620
 Yes, you got it right.

1:34:10.620 --> 1:34:15.620
 So it's sort of, it has the components

1:34:15.980 --> 1:34:18.460
 of both of protein folding

1:34:18.460 --> 1:34:21.900
 and protein, protein interactions.

1:34:21.900 --> 1:34:24.460
 Because in order for these domains,

1:34:24.460 --> 1:34:27.260
 many of these proteins actually,

1:34:27.260 --> 1:34:30.060
 they never form a stable structure.

1:34:31.140 --> 1:34:33.020
 One of my favorite proteins,

1:34:33.020 --> 1:34:37.700
 and pretty much everyone who works in the,

1:34:37.700 --> 1:34:41.740
 I know, whom I know, who works with proteins,

1:34:41.740 --> 1:34:44.660
 they always have their favorite proteins.

1:34:44.660 --> 1:34:47.660
 Right, so one of my favorite proteins,

1:34:47.660 --> 1:34:49.140
 probably my favorite protein,

1:34:49.140 --> 1:34:51.420
 the one that I worked when I was a postdoc

1:34:51.420 --> 1:34:56.180
 is so called post synaptic density 95, PSD 95 protein.

1:34:56.180 --> 1:35:00.500
 So it's one of the key actors

1:35:00.500 --> 1:35:03.780
 in the majority of neurological processes

1:35:03.780 --> 1:35:04.700
 at the molecular level.

1:35:04.700 --> 1:35:09.700
 So it's a, and essentially it's a key player

1:35:11.060 --> 1:35:13.460
 in the post synaptic density.

1:35:13.460 --> 1:35:17.180
 So this is the crucial part of this synapse

1:35:17.180 --> 1:35:22.180
 where a lot of these chemical processes are happening.

1:35:22.420 --> 1:35:26.220
 So it has five domains, right?

1:35:26.220 --> 1:35:27.460
 So five protein domains.

1:35:27.460 --> 1:35:32.460
 So pretty large proteins, I think 600 something assets.

1:35:35.700 --> 1:35:40.700
 But the way it's organized itself, it's flexible, right?

1:35:41.260 --> 1:35:43.820
 So it acts as a scaffold.

1:35:43.820 --> 1:35:48.820
 So it is used to bring in other proteins.

1:35:49.260 --> 1:35:54.260
 So they start acting in the orchestrated manner, right?

1:35:54.260 --> 1:35:58.780
 So, and the type of the shape of this protein,

1:35:58.780 --> 1:36:02.500
 it's in a way, there are some stable parts of this protein,

1:36:02.500 --> 1:36:04.420
 but there are some flexible.

1:36:04.420 --> 1:36:08.580
 And this flexibility is built in into the protein

1:36:08.580 --> 1:36:13.100
 in order to become sort of this multifunctional machine.

1:36:13.100 --> 1:36:16.460
 So do you think that kind of thing is also learnable

1:36:16.460 --> 1:36:19.340
 through the alpha fold two kind of approach?

1:36:19.340 --> 1:36:22.380
 I mean, the time will tell.

1:36:22.380 --> 1:36:24.460
 Is it another level of complexity?

1:36:24.460 --> 1:36:27.300
 Is it like how big of a jump in complexity

1:36:27.300 --> 1:36:28.140
 is that whole thing?

1:36:28.140 --> 1:36:31.340
 To me, it's yet another level of complexity

1:36:31.340 --> 1:36:35.140
 because when we talk about protein, protein interactions,

1:36:35.140 --> 1:36:38.820
 and there is actually a different challenge for this

1:36:38.820 --> 1:36:43.420
 called Capri, and so this, that is focused specifically

1:36:43.420 --> 1:36:47.060
 on macromolecular interactions, protein, protein, protein,

1:36:47.060 --> 1:36:48.540
 DNA, et cetera.

1:36:48.540 --> 1:36:53.540
 So, but it's, there are different mechanisms

1:36:56.020 --> 1:36:58.740
 that govern molecular interactions

1:36:58.740 --> 1:37:00.740
 and that need to be picked up,

1:37:00.740 --> 1:37:03.660
 say by a machine learning algorithm.

1:37:03.660 --> 1:37:06.500
 Interestingly enough, we actually,

1:37:06.500 --> 1:37:11.500
 we participated for a few years in this competition.

1:37:11.740 --> 1:37:14.900
 We typically don't participate in competitions,

1:37:14.900 --> 1:37:19.820
 I don't know, don't have enough time,

1:37:19.820 --> 1:37:23.700
 because it's very intensive, it's a very intensive process.

1:37:23.700 --> 1:37:28.700
 But we participated back in about 10 years ago or so.

1:37:30.580 --> 1:37:32.660
 And the way we entered this competition,

1:37:32.660 --> 1:37:35.420
 so we design a scoring function, right?

1:37:35.420 --> 1:37:37.580
 So the function that evaluates

1:37:37.580 --> 1:37:40.540
 whether or not your protein, protein interaction

1:37:40.540 --> 1:37:43.380
 is supposed to look like experimentally solved, right?

1:37:43.380 --> 1:37:45.900
 So the scoring function is very critical part

1:37:45.900 --> 1:37:49.820
 of the model prediction.

1:37:49.820 --> 1:37:52.740
 So we designed it to be a machine learning one.

1:37:52.740 --> 1:37:56.620
 And so it was one of the first machine learning

1:37:56.620 --> 1:38:00.020
 based scoring function used in Capri.

1:38:00.020 --> 1:38:05.020
 And we essentially learned what should contribute,

1:38:06.580 --> 1:38:08.860
 what are the critical components contributing

1:38:08.860 --> 1:38:10.540
 into the protein, protein interaction.

1:38:10.540 --> 1:38:13.340
 So this could be converted into a learning problem

1:38:13.340 --> 1:38:15.620
 and thereby it could be learned?

1:38:15.620 --> 1:38:17.020
 I believe so, yes.

1:38:17.020 --> 1:38:20.460
 Do you think AlphaFold2 or something similar to it

1:38:20.460 --> 1:38:24.300
 from DeepMind or somebody else will be,

1:38:24.300 --> 1:38:28.660
 will result in a Nobel Prize or multiple Nobel Prizes?

1:38:28.660 --> 1:38:33.300
 So like, you know, obviously, maybe not so obviously,

1:38:33.300 --> 1:38:37.420
 you can't give a Nobel Prize to a computer program.

1:38:38.660 --> 1:38:42.140
 At least for now, give it to the designers of that program.

1:38:42.140 --> 1:38:46.060
 But do you see one or multiple Nobel Prizes

1:38:46.060 --> 1:38:51.060
 where AlphaFold2 is like a large percentage

1:38:51.700 --> 1:38:54.860
 of what that prize is given for?

1:38:54.860 --> 1:38:58.980
 Would it lead to discoveries at the level of Nobel Prizes?

1:39:00.540 --> 1:39:05.420
 I mean, I think we are definitely destined

1:39:05.420 --> 1:39:08.740
 to see the Nobel Prize becoming sort of,

1:39:08.740 --> 1:39:12.340
 to be evolving with the evolution of science

1:39:12.340 --> 1:39:14.540
 and the evolution of science as such

1:39:14.540 --> 1:39:17.860
 that it now becomes like really multi facets, right?

1:39:17.860 --> 1:39:21.340
 So where you don't really have like a unique discipline,

1:39:21.340 --> 1:39:25.660
 you have sort of the, a lot of cross disciplinary talks

1:39:25.660 --> 1:39:28.740
 in order to achieve sort of, you know,

1:39:28.740 --> 1:39:32.380
 really big advancements, you know.

1:39:32.380 --> 1:39:37.380
 So I think, you know, the computational methods

1:39:39.180 --> 1:39:42.500
 will be acknowledged in one way or another.

1:39:42.500 --> 1:39:46.860
 And as a matter of fact, you know,

1:39:46.860 --> 1:39:50.580
 they were first acknowledged back in 2013, right?

1:39:50.580 --> 1:39:55.580
 Where, you know, the first three people were, you know,

1:39:56.500 --> 1:40:00.540
 awarded the Nobel Prize for study the protein folding,

1:40:00.540 --> 1:40:01.500
 right, the principle.

1:40:01.500 --> 1:40:03.820
 And, you know, I think all three of them

1:40:03.820 --> 1:40:06.940
 are computational biophysicists, right?

1:40:06.940 --> 1:40:11.940
 So, you know, that I think is unavoidable.

1:40:13.260 --> 1:40:16.580
 You know, it will come with the time.

1:40:16.580 --> 1:40:21.580
 The fact that, you know, alpha fold and, you know,

1:40:23.540 --> 1:40:26.340
 similar approaches, because again, it's a matter of time

1:40:26.340 --> 1:40:31.340
 that people will embrace this, you know, principle

1:40:31.700 --> 1:40:34.940
 and we'll see more and more such, you know,

1:40:34.940 --> 1:40:36.940
 such tools coming into play.

1:40:36.940 --> 1:40:41.940
 But, you know, these methods will be critical

1:40:41.940 --> 1:40:46.940
 in a scientific discovery, no doubts about it.

1:40:47.700 --> 1:40:51.500
 On the engineering side, maybe a dark question,

1:40:51.500 --> 1:40:53.860
 but do you think it's possible to use

1:40:53.860 --> 1:40:55.140
 these machine learning methods

1:40:55.140 --> 1:40:59.020
 to start to engineer proteins?

1:40:59.020 --> 1:41:04.020
 And the next question is something quite a few biologists

1:41:04.660 --> 1:41:07.300
 are against, some are for, for study purposes,

1:41:07.300 --> 1:41:09.620
 is to engineer viruses.

1:41:09.620 --> 1:41:12.620
 Do you think machine learning, like something like alpha fold

1:41:12.620 --> 1:41:14.780
 could be used to engineer viruses?

1:41:14.780 --> 1:41:16.980
 So to answer the first question, you know,

1:41:16.980 --> 1:41:21.660
 it has been, you know, a part of the research

1:41:21.660 --> 1:41:25.500
 in the protein science, the protein design is, you know,

1:41:25.500 --> 1:41:29.180
 is a very prominent areas of research.

1:41:29.180 --> 1:41:32.020
 Of course, you know, one of the pioneers is David Baker

1:41:32.020 --> 1:41:34.900
 and Rosetta algorithm that, you know,

1:41:34.900 --> 1:41:39.740
 essentially was doing the de novo design and was used

1:41:39.740 --> 1:41:41.580
 to design new proteins, you know.

1:41:41.580 --> 1:41:44.220
 And design of proteins means design of function.

1:41:44.220 --> 1:41:47.300
 So like when you design a protein, you can control,

1:41:47.300 --> 1:41:49.100
 I mean, the whole point of a protein

1:41:49.100 --> 1:41:52.180
 with the protein structure comes a function,

1:41:52.180 --> 1:41:53.700
 like it's doing something.

1:41:53.700 --> 1:41:54.540
 Correct.

1:41:54.540 --> 1:41:56.060
 So you can design different things.

1:41:56.060 --> 1:41:58.140
 So you can, yeah, so you can, well,

1:41:58.140 --> 1:42:00.700
 you can look at the proteins from the functional perspective.

1:42:00.700 --> 1:42:02.700
 You can also look at the proteins

1:42:02.700 --> 1:42:04.180
 from the structural perspective, right?

1:42:04.180 --> 1:42:05.700
 So the structural building blocks.

1:42:05.700 --> 1:42:07.660
 So if you want to have a building block

1:42:07.660 --> 1:42:10.540
 of a certain shape, you can try to achieve it

1:42:10.540 --> 1:42:13.140
 by, you know, introducing a new protein sequence

1:42:13.140 --> 1:42:17.260
 and predicting, you know, how it will fold.

1:42:17.260 --> 1:42:22.060
 So with that, I mean, it's a natural,

1:42:22.060 --> 1:42:25.820
 one of the, you know, natural applications

1:42:25.820 --> 1:42:28.220
 of these algorithms.

1:42:28.220 --> 1:42:34.140
 Now, talking about engineering a virus.

1:42:34.140 --> 1:42:35.140
 With machine learning.

1:42:35.140 --> 1:42:36.380
 With machine learning, right?

1:42:36.380 --> 1:42:41.740
 So, well, you know, so luckily for us,

1:42:41.740 --> 1:42:46.780
 I mean, we don't have that much data, right?

1:42:46.780 --> 1:42:47.580
 Yeah.

1:42:47.580 --> 1:42:50.100
 We actually, right now, one of the projects

1:42:50.100 --> 1:42:53.700
 that we are carrying on in the lab

1:42:53.700 --> 1:42:56.940
 is we're trying to develop a machine learning algorithm

1:42:56.940 --> 1:42:59.300
 that determines the,

1:42:59.300 --> 1:43:02.700
 whether or not the current strain is pathogenic.

1:43:02.700 --> 1:43:04.620
 And the current strain of the coronavirus.

1:43:04.620 --> 1:43:06.100
 Of the virus.

1:43:06.100 --> 1:43:08.980
 I mean, so there are applications to coronaviruses

1:43:08.980 --> 1:43:11.460
 because we have strains of SARS COVID 2,

1:43:11.460 --> 1:43:14.580
 also SARS COVID, MERS that are pathogenic,

1:43:14.580 --> 1:43:17.620
 but we also have strains of other coronaviruses

1:43:17.620 --> 1:43:20.140
 that are, you know, not pathogenic.

1:43:20.140 --> 1:43:24.060
 I mean, the common cold viruses and, you know,

1:43:24.060 --> 1:43:25.580
 some other ones, right?

1:43:25.580 --> 1:43:28.980
 So, so pathogenic meaning spreading.

1:43:28.980 --> 1:43:33.780
 Pathogenic means actually inflicting damage.

1:43:33.780 --> 1:43:35.340
 Correct.

1:43:35.340 --> 1:43:37.020
 There are also some, you know,

1:43:37.020 --> 1:43:41.780
 seasonal versus pandemic strains of influenza, right?

1:43:41.780 --> 1:43:45.220
 And determining the, what are the molecular determinant,

1:43:45.220 --> 1:43:46.060
 right?

1:43:46.060 --> 1:43:48.300
 So that are built in, into the protein sequence,

1:43:48.300 --> 1:43:50.700
 into the gene sequence, right?

1:43:50.700 --> 1:43:52.980
 So, and whether or not the machine learning

1:43:52.980 --> 1:43:57.980
 can determine those, those components, right?

1:43:58.420 --> 1:43:59.260
 Oh, interesting.

1:43:59.260 --> 1:44:00.660
 So like using machine learning to do,

1:44:00.660 --> 1:44:03.940
 that's really interesting to, to, to given,

1:44:03.940 --> 1:44:07.380
 give the input is like what the entire,

1:44:07.380 --> 1:44:09.740
 the protein sequence and then determine

1:44:09.740 --> 1:44:12.340
 if this thing is going to be able to do damage

1:44:12.340 --> 1:44:14.620
 to a biological system.

1:44:14.620 --> 1:44:15.900
 Yeah.

1:44:15.900 --> 1:44:16.740
 So, so I mean,

1:44:16.740 --> 1:44:17.580
 It's a good machine learning,

1:44:17.580 --> 1:44:19.380
 you're saying we don't have enough data for that?

1:44:19.380 --> 1:44:22.620
 We, I mean, for, for this specific one, we do.

1:44:22.620 --> 1:44:24.460
 We might actually, I have, you know,

1:44:24.460 --> 1:44:27.260
 have to back up on this because we're still in the process.

1:44:27.260 --> 1:44:31.660
 There was one work that appeared in bioarchive

1:44:31.660 --> 1:44:34.900
 by Eugene Kunin, who is one of these, you know,

1:44:34.900 --> 1:44:38.140
 pioneers in, in, in evolutionary genomics.

1:44:39.020 --> 1:44:42.820
 And they tried to look at this, but, you know,

1:44:42.820 --> 1:44:46.060
 the methods were sort of standard, you know,

1:44:46.060 --> 1:44:48.620
 supervised learning methods.

1:44:48.620 --> 1:44:51.340
 And now the question is, you know,

1:44:51.340 --> 1:44:56.340
 can you advance it further by, by using, you know,

1:44:56.660 --> 1:44:58.620
 not so standard methods, you know?

1:44:58.620 --> 1:45:01.140
 So there's obviously a lot of hope in,

1:45:01.140 --> 1:45:05.580
 in transfer learning where you can actually try to transfer

1:45:05.580 --> 1:45:08.060
 the information that the machine learning learns about

1:45:08.060 --> 1:45:11.340
 the proper protein sequences, right?

1:45:11.340 --> 1:45:16.140
 And, you know, so, so there is some promise

1:45:16.140 --> 1:45:18.740
 in going this direction, but if we have this,

1:45:18.740 --> 1:45:21.060
 it would be extremely useful because then

1:45:21.060 --> 1:45:24.100
 we could essentially forecast the potential mutations

1:45:24.100 --> 1:45:26.300
 that would make the current strain

1:45:26.300 --> 1:45:27.900
 more or less pathogenic.

1:45:27.900 --> 1:45:31.140
 Anticipate, anticipate them from a vaccine development,

1:45:31.140 --> 1:45:34.580
 for the treatment, antiviral drug development.

1:45:34.580 --> 1:45:36.860
 That, that would be a very crucial task.

1:45:36.860 --> 1:45:41.860
 But you could also use that system to then say,

1:45:42.180 --> 1:45:45.260
 how would we potentially modify this virus

1:45:45.260 --> 1:45:47.940
 to make it more pathogenic?

1:45:47.940 --> 1:45:49.660
 This, that's true.

1:45:49.660 --> 1:45:50.500
 That's true.

1:45:50.500 --> 1:45:55.500
 And then, you know, the, again,

1:45:55.980 --> 1:45:59.700
 the hope is, well, several things, right?

1:45:59.700 --> 1:46:02.140
 So one is that, you know, it's,

1:46:02.140 --> 1:46:06.780
 even if you design a, you know, a sequence, right?

1:46:06.780 --> 1:46:11.780
 So to carry out the actual experimental biology,

1:46:12.540 --> 1:46:16.820
 to ensure that all the components working, you know,

1:46:16.820 --> 1:46:19.060
 is a completely different matter.

1:46:19.060 --> 1:46:19.900
 Difficult process.

1:46:19.900 --> 1:46:20.860
 Yes.

1:46:20.860 --> 1:46:24.420
 Then the, you know, we've seen in the past,

1:46:24.420 --> 1:46:27.660
 there could be some regulation of the moment

1:46:27.660 --> 1:46:30.420
 the scientific community recognizes

1:46:30.420 --> 1:46:34.620
 that it's now becoming no longer a sort of a fun puzzle

1:46:34.620 --> 1:46:36.660
 to, you know, for machine learning.

1:46:36.660 --> 1:46:37.860
 Could be open.

1:46:37.860 --> 1:46:40.420
 Yeah, so then there might be some regulation.

1:46:40.420 --> 1:46:45.420
 So I think back in, what, 2015, there was, you know,

1:46:45.780 --> 1:46:49.500
 there was an issue on regulating the research

1:46:49.500 --> 1:46:52.700
 on influenza strains, right?

1:46:52.700 --> 1:46:55.580
 There were several groups, you know,

1:46:55.580 --> 1:46:58.060
 used sort of the mutation analysis

1:46:58.060 --> 1:47:01.820
 to determine whether or not this strain will jump

1:47:01.820 --> 1:47:03.300
 from one species to another.

1:47:03.300 --> 1:47:06.540
 And I think there was like a half a year moratorium

1:47:06.540 --> 1:47:09.780
 on the research on the paper published

1:47:09.780 --> 1:47:13.580
 until, you know, scientists, you know, analyzed it

1:47:13.580 --> 1:47:16.440
 and decided that it's actually safe.

1:47:16.440 --> 1:47:17.620
 I forgot what that's called.

1:47:17.620 --> 1:47:20.020
 Something of function, test of function.

1:47:20.020 --> 1:47:20.860
 Gain of function.

1:47:20.860 --> 1:47:22.380
 Gain of function, yeah.

1:47:22.380 --> 1:47:24.020
 Gain of function, loss of function, that's right.

1:47:24.020 --> 1:47:24.860
 Sorry.

1:47:26.420 --> 1:47:29.620
 It's like, let's watch this thing mutate for a while

1:47:29.620 --> 1:47:33.780
 to see like, to see what kind of things we can observe.

1:47:33.780 --> 1:47:36.320
 I guess I'm not so much worried

1:47:36.320 --> 1:47:38.620
 about that kind of research if there's a lot of regulation

1:47:38.620 --> 1:47:42.780
 and if it's done very well and with competence and seriously.

1:47:42.780 --> 1:47:46.980
 I am more worried about kind of this, you know,

1:47:46.980 --> 1:47:49.580
 the underlying aspect of this question

1:47:49.580 --> 1:47:51.280
 is more like 50 years from now.

1:47:52.920 --> 1:47:54.940
 Speaking to the Drake equation,

1:47:54.940 --> 1:47:57.300
 one of the parameters in the Drake equation

1:47:57.300 --> 1:47:59.820
 is how long civilizations last.

1:47:59.820 --> 1:48:03.860
 And that seems to be the most important value actually

1:48:03.860 --> 1:48:06.100
 for calculating if there's other alien

1:48:06.100 --> 1:48:08.040
 intelligent civilizations out there.

1:48:08.040 --> 1:48:10.960
 That's where there's most variability.

1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:15.060
 Assuming like if life, if that percentage

1:48:15.060 --> 1:48:19.380
 that life can emerge is like not zero,

1:48:19.380 --> 1:48:21.260
 like if we're a super unique,

1:48:21.260 --> 1:48:23.940
 then it's the how long we last

1:48:23.940 --> 1:48:26.180
 is basically the most important thing.

1:48:26.180 --> 1:48:29.020
 So from a selfish perspective,

1:48:29.020 --> 1:48:32.020
 but also from a Drake equation perspective,

1:48:32.020 --> 1:48:35.020
 I'm worried about our civilization lasting.

1:48:35.020 --> 1:48:37.620
 And you kind of think about all the ways

1:48:37.620 --> 1:48:39.140
 in which machine learning can be used

1:48:39.140 --> 1:48:44.140
 to design greater weapons of destruction, right?

1:48:45.700 --> 1:48:48.620
 And I mean, one way to ask that

1:48:48.620 --> 1:48:50.580
 if you look sort of 50 years from now,

1:48:50.580 --> 1:48:52.620
 a hundred years from now,

1:48:52.620 --> 1:48:55.780
 would you be more worried about natural pandemics

1:48:55.780 --> 1:48:57.560
 or engineered pandemics?

1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:02.640
 Like who's the better designer of viruses,

1:49:02.640 --> 1:49:05.980
 nature or humans if we look down the line?

1:49:05.980 --> 1:49:10.140
 I think in my view, I would still be worried

1:49:10.140 --> 1:49:14.300
 about the natural pandemics simply because I mean,

1:49:14.300 --> 1:49:19.300
 the capacity of the nature producing this.

1:49:20.740 --> 1:49:22.700
 It does pretty good job, right?

1:49:22.700 --> 1:49:23.540
 Yes.

1:49:23.540 --> 1:49:25.280
 And the motivation for using virus,

1:49:25.280 --> 1:49:29.020
 engineering viruses as a weapon is a weird one

1:49:29.020 --> 1:49:31.480
 because maybe you can correct me on this,

1:49:31.480 --> 1:49:35.620
 but it seems very difficult to target a virus, right?

1:49:35.620 --> 1:49:38.400
 The whole point of a weapon, the way a rocket works,

1:49:38.400 --> 1:49:40.100
 if a starting point, you have an end point

1:49:40.100 --> 1:49:42.340
 and you're trying to hit a target,

1:49:42.340 --> 1:49:44.660
 to hit a target with a virus is very difficult.

1:49:44.660 --> 1:49:46.820
 It's basically just, right?

1:49:47.980 --> 1:49:50.060
 The target would be the human species.

1:49:51.940 --> 1:49:52.860
 Oh man.

1:49:52.860 --> 1:49:54.780
 Yeah, I have a hope in us.

1:49:54.780 --> 1:49:58.260
 I'm forever optimistic that we will not,

1:49:58.260 --> 1:50:01.620
 there's insufficient evil in the world

1:50:01.620 --> 1:50:04.560
 to lead to that kind of destruction.

1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:07.780
 Well, I also hope that, I mean, that's what we see.

1:50:07.780 --> 1:50:11.780
 I mean, with the way we are getting connected,

1:50:11.780 --> 1:50:14.460
 the world is getting connected.

1:50:14.460 --> 1:50:19.460
 I think it helps for the world to become more transparent.

1:50:21.660 --> 1:50:22.560
 Yeah.

1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:27.100
 So the information spread is,

1:50:27.100 --> 1:50:31.660
 I think it's one of the key things for the society

1:50:31.660 --> 1:50:36.460
 to become more balanced one way or another.

1:50:36.460 --> 1:50:38.340
 This is something that people disagree with me on,

1:50:38.340 --> 1:50:41.900
 but I do think that the kind of secrecy

1:50:41.900 --> 1:50:43.460
 that governments have.

1:50:43.460 --> 1:50:47.060
 So you're kind of speaking more to the other aspects,

1:50:47.060 --> 1:50:49.700
 like a research community being more open,

1:50:49.700 --> 1:50:52.160
 companies are being more open.

1:50:52.160 --> 1:50:53.880
 Government is still like,

1:50:55.900 --> 1:50:57.860
 we're talking about like military secrets.

1:50:57.860 --> 1:51:01.380
 I think military secrets of the kind

1:51:01.380 --> 1:51:03.700
 that could destroy the world

1:51:03.700 --> 1:51:07.300
 will become also a thing of the 20th century.

1:51:07.300 --> 1:51:09.320
 It'll become more and more open.

1:51:09.320 --> 1:51:10.160
 Yeah.

1:51:10.160 --> 1:51:13.220
 I think nations will lose power in the 21st century,

1:51:13.220 --> 1:51:15.960
 like lose sufficient power towards secrecies.

1:51:15.960 --> 1:51:18.860
 Transparency is more beneficial than secrecy,

1:51:18.860 --> 1:51:21.140
 but of course it's not obvious.

1:51:21.140 --> 1:51:22.180
 Let's hope so.

1:51:22.180 --> 1:51:27.180
 Let's hope so that the governments

1:51:27.180 --> 1:51:31.300
 will become more transparent.

1:51:31.300 --> 1:51:35.260
 What, so we last talked, I think in March or April,

1:51:35.260 --> 1:51:36.740
 what have you learned?

1:51:36.740 --> 1:51:40.460
 How has your philosophical, psychological,

1:51:40.460 --> 1:51:43.820
 biological worldview changed since then?

1:51:43.820 --> 1:51:46.100
 Or you've been studying it nonstop

1:51:46.100 --> 1:51:48.900
 from a computational biology perspective.

1:51:48.900 --> 1:51:51.140
 How has your understanding and thoughts about this virus

1:51:51.140 --> 1:51:54.460
 changed over those months from the beginning to today?

1:51:54.460 --> 1:51:58.660
 One thing that I was really amazed at

1:51:58.660 --> 1:52:03.140
 how efficient the scientific community was.

1:52:03.140 --> 1:52:08.140
 I mean, and even just judging on this very narrow domain

1:52:10.100 --> 1:52:13.060
 of protein structure and understanding

1:52:13.060 --> 1:52:17.600
 the structural characterization of this virus

1:52:17.600 --> 1:52:19.860
 from the components point of view,

1:52:19.860 --> 1:52:21.460
 whole virus point of view.

1:52:21.460 --> 1:52:26.460
 If you look at SARS, something that happened less than 20,

1:52:31.020 --> 1:52:34.060
 but close enough, 20 years ago,

1:52:34.980 --> 1:52:38.500
 and you see what, when it happened,

1:52:38.500 --> 1:52:42.460
 what was sort of the response by the scientific community,

1:52:42.460 --> 1:52:47.100
 you see that the structure characterizations did a cure,

1:52:47.100 --> 1:52:51.660
 but it took several years, right?

1:52:51.660 --> 1:52:54.940
 Now the things that took several years,

1:52:54.940 --> 1:52:56.900
 it's a matter of months, right?

1:52:56.900 --> 1:53:01.620
 So we see that the research pop up.

1:53:01.620 --> 1:53:03.940
 We are at the unprecedented level

1:53:03.940 --> 1:53:05.980
 in terms of the sequencing, right?

1:53:05.980 --> 1:53:10.980
 Never before we had a single virus sequence so many times,

1:53:10.980 --> 1:53:15.980
 so which allows us to actually to trace very precisely

1:53:16.380 --> 1:53:21.380
 the sort of the evolutionary nature of this virus,

1:53:21.380 --> 1:53:26.380
 what happens, and it's not just this virus independently

1:53:27.420 --> 1:53:32.420
 of everything, it's the sequence of this virus

1:53:32.420 --> 1:53:36.420
 linked, anchored to the specific geographic place

1:53:36.420 --> 1:53:24.540
 to specific

1:53:24.540 --> 1:53:29.540
 people, because our genotype influences also

1:53:31.540 --> 1:53:35.540
 the evolution of this, it's always a host pathogen,

1:53:35.540 --> 1:53:38.540
 core evolution that, you know,

1:53:38.540 --> 1:53:41.540
 it's not just the virus, it's the sequence of this virus,

1:53:41.540 --> 1:53:44.540
 it's the sequence of this virus linked to the specific

1:53:44.540 --> 1:53:48.540
 geographic place, it's the sequence of this virus

1:53:48.540 --> 1:53:52.540
 linked to the specific geographic place to specific people,

1:53:52.540 --> 1:53:55.540
 that, you know, occurs.

1:53:55.540 --> 1:53:58.540
 It'd be cool if we also had a lot more data about,

1:53:58.540 --> 1:54:02.540
 so that the spread of this virus, not maybe,

1:54:02.540 --> 1:54:06.540
 well, it'd be nice if we had it for like contact tracing

1:54:06.540 --> 1:54:09.540
 purposes for this virus, but it'd be also nice if we had it

1:54:09.540 --> 1:54:12.540
 for the study for future viruses to be able to respond

1:54:12.540 --> 1:54:15.540
 and so on, but it's already nice that we have geographical

1:54:15.540 --> 1:54:18.540
 data and the basic data from individual humans, yeah.

1:54:18.540 --> 1:54:22.540
 Exactly, no, I think contact tracing is obviously

1:54:22.540 --> 1:54:26.540
 a key component in understanding

1:54:26.540 --> 1:54:29.540
 the spread of this virus.

1:54:29.540 --> 1:54:31.540
 There is also, there is a number of challenges, right?

1:54:31.540 --> 1:54:35.540
 So XPRIZE is one of them, we

1:54:35.540 --> 1:54:39.540
 just recently took a part of

1:54:39.540 --> 1:54:43.540
 this competition, it's the prediction of the

1:54:43.540 --> 1:54:47.540
 number of infections in different regions.

1:54:47.540 --> 1:54:48.540
 Oh, sure.

1:54:48.540 --> 1:54:52.540
 So, you know, obviously the AI

1:54:52.540 --> 1:54:55.540
 is the main topic in those predictions.

1:54:55.540 --> 1:54:59.540
 Yeah, but it's still, the data, I mean, that's a competition,

1:54:59.540 --> 1:55:03.540
 but the data is weak

1:55:03.540 --> 1:55:07.540
 on the training. Like, it's great,

1:55:07.540 --> 1:55:11.540
 it's much more than probably before, but like, it'd be nice if it was like

1:55:11.540 --> 1:55:15.540
 really rich. I talked to Michael Mina from

1:55:15.540 --> 1:55:19.540
 Harvard, I mean, he dreams that the community comes together with like a

1:55:19.540 --> 1:55:23.540
 weather map to where viruses, right, like

1:55:23.540 --> 1:55:27.540
 really high resolution sensors on like how

1:55:27.540 --> 1:55:31.540
 from person to person the viruses that travel, all the different kinds of viruses, right?

1:55:31.540 --> 1:55:35.540
 Because there's a ton of them, and then you'd be able to tell

1:55:35.540 --> 1:55:39.540
 the story that you've spoken about

1:55:39.540 --> 1:55:43.540
 of the evolution of these viruses, like day to day mutations that

1:55:43.540 --> 1:55:47.540
 are occurring. I mean, that'd be fascinating just from a perspective of

1:55:47.540 --> 1:55:51.540
 study and from the perspective of being able to respond to future pandemics.

1:55:51.540 --> 1:55:55.540
 That's ultimately what I'm worried about. People love

1:55:55.540 --> 1:55:59.540
 books. Is there some three

1:55:59.540 --> 1:56:03.540
 or whatever number of books, technical, fiction, philosophical, that

1:56:03.540 --> 1:56:07.540
 brought you joy in life, had an impact on your life,

1:56:07.540 --> 1:56:11.540
 and maybe some that you would recommend others?

1:56:11.540 --> 1:56:15.540
 I'll give you three very different books, and I also have a special runner up.

1:56:15.540 --> 1:56:19.540
 Honorable mention.

1:56:19.540 --> 1:56:23.540
 I mean, it's an audiobook, and that's

1:56:23.540 --> 1:56:27.540
 some specific reason behind it. So the first book is

1:56:27.540 --> 1:56:31.540
 something that sort of impacted my earlier

1:56:31.540 --> 1:56:35.540
 stage of life, and I'm probably not going to be very original here.

1:56:35.540 --> 1:56:39.540
 It's Bulgakov's Master and Margarita.

1:56:39.540 --> 1:56:43.540
 For a Russian, maybe it's not super original,

1:56:43.540 --> 1:56:47.540
 but it's a really powerful book, even in English.

1:56:47.540 --> 1:56:51.540
 It is incredibly powerful, and

1:56:51.540 --> 1:56:55.540
 I mean, the way it ends.

1:56:55.540 --> 1:56:59.540
 I still have goosebumps when I read

1:56:59.540 --> 1:57:03.540
 the very last sort of, it's called prologue, where

1:57:03.540 --> 1:57:07.540
 it's just so powerful. What impact did it have on you? What ideas?

1:57:07.540 --> 1:57:11.540
 What insights did you get from it? I was just taken by

1:57:11.540 --> 1:57:15.540
 the fact that

1:57:15.540 --> 1:57:19.540
 you have those parallel lives

1:57:19.540 --> 1:57:23.540
 apart from many centuries, and

1:57:23.540 --> 1:57:27.540
 somehow they got sort of intertwined into

1:57:27.540 --> 1:57:31.540
 one story, and that

1:57:31.540 --> 1:57:35.540
 to me was fascinating. And of course

1:57:35.540 --> 1:57:39.540
 the romantic part of this book is like

1:57:39.540 --> 1:57:43.540
 it's not just romance, it's like the romance

1:57:43.540 --> 1:57:47.540
 empowered by sort of magic, right?

1:57:47.540 --> 1:57:51.540
 And maybe on top of that, you have some irony,

1:57:51.540 --> 1:57:55.540
 which is unavoidable, right? Because it was that

1:57:55.540 --> 1:57:59.540
 Soviet time. But it's very deeply Russian, so that's

1:57:59.540 --> 1:58:03.540
 the wit, the humor, the pain, the love,

1:58:03.540 --> 1:58:07.540
 all of that is one of the books that kind of captures

1:58:07.540 --> 1:58:11.540
 something about Russian culture that people outside of Russia

1:58:11.540 --> 1:58:15.540
 should probably read. I agree. What's the second one? So the second one

1:58:15.540 --> 1:58:19.540
 is again another one that it happened

1:58:19.540 --> 1:58:23.540
 I read it later in my life. I think I read it

1:58:23.540 --> 1:58:27.540
 first time when I was a graduate student.

1:58:27.540 --> 1:58:31.540
 And that's the Solzhenitsyn's Cancer Word.

1:58:31.540 --> 1:58:35.540
 That is amazingly powerful book.

1:58:35.540 --> 1:58:39.540
 What is it about? It's about, I mean, essentially

1:58:39.540 --> 1:58:43.540
 based on Solzhenitsyn was

1:58:43.540 --> 1:58:47.540
 diagnosed with cancer when he was reasonably young, and he

1:58:47.540 --> 1:58:51.540
 made a full recovery. So this is

1:58:51.540 --> 1:58:55.540
 about a person who was sentenced

1:58:55.540 --> 1:58:59.540
 for life in one of these camps.

1:58:59.540 --> 1:59:03.540
 And he had some cancer,

1:59:03.540 --> 1:59:07.540
 so he was transported back to one of these

1:59:07.540 --> 1:59:11.540
 Soviet republics, I think it was

1:59:11.540 --> 1:59:15.540
 South Asian republics. And the

1:59:15.540 --> 1:59:19.540
 book is about

1:59:19.540 --> 1:59:23.540
 his experience being a

1:59:23.540 --> 1:59:27.540
 prisoner, being a patient in the

1:59:27.540 --> 1:59:31.540
 cancer clinic, in the cancer ward, surrounded

1:59:31.540 --> 1:59:35.540
 by people, many of which die.

1:59:35.540 --> 1:59:39.540
 But in the way

1:59:39.540 --> 1:59:43.540
 it reads, first of all, later on I

1:59:43.540 --> 1:59:47.540
 read the accounts of the doctors

1:59:47.540 --> 1:59:51.540
 who describe the experiences

1:59:51.540 --> 1:59:55.540
 in the book by the

1:59:55.540 --> 1:59:59.540
 patient as incredibly accurate.

1:59:59.540 --> 2:00:03.540
 So I read that there was some doctor saying that

2:00:03.540 --> 2:00:07.540
 every single doctor should read this book to understand

2:00:07.540 --> 2:00:11.540
 what the patient feels. But

2:00:11.540 --> 2:00:15.540
 again, as many of the Solzhenitsyn's

2:00:15.540 --> 2:00:19.540
 books, it has multiple levels of complexity.

2:00:19.540 --> 2:00:23.540
 And obviously if you look above

2:00:23.540 --> 2:00:27.540
 the cancer and the patient, the

2:00:27.540 --> 2:00:31.540
 tumor that was growing and then disappeared

2:00:31.540 --> 2:00:35.540
 in his

2:00:35.540 --> 2:00:39.540
 body with some consequences, this is

2:00:39.540 --> 2:00:43.540
 allegorically the

2:00:43.540 --> 2:00:47.540
 Soviet, and he actually

2:00:47.540 --> 2:00:51.540
 when he was asked, he said that this is what made him

2:00:51.540 --> 2:00:55.540
 think about this, how to combine these experiences.

2:00:55.540 --> 2:00:59.540
 Him being a part of the Soviet regime,

2:00:59.540 --> 2:01:03.540
 also being a part of the

2:01:03.540 --> 2:01:07.540
 someone sent to Gulag camp,

2:01:07.540 --> 2:01:11.540
 and also someone who experienced cancer

2:01:11.540 --> 2:01:15.540
 in his life. The Gulag Archipelago

2:01:15.540 --> 2:01:19.540
 and this book, these are the works that actually made him

2:01:19.540 --> 2:01:23.540
 receive a Nobel Prize. But to me

2:01:23.540 --> 2:01:27.540
 I've read

2:01:27.540 --> 2:01:31.540
 other books by Solzhenitsyn.

2:01:31.540 --> 2:01:35.540
 This one to me is the most powerful one.

2:01:35.540 --> 2:01:39.540
 And by the way, both this one and the previous one you read in Russian?

2:01:39.540 --> 2:01:43.540
 Yes. So now there is the third book is an English book

2:01:43.540 --> 2:01:47.540
 and it's completely different. So we're switching the gears

2:01:47.540 --> 2:01:51.540
 completely. So this is the book which, it's not even

2:01:51.540 --> 2:01:55.540
 a book, it's an essay by

2:01:55.540 --> 2:01:59.540
 Jonathan Neumann called The Computer and the Brain.

2:01:59.540 --> 2:02:03.540
 And that was the book he was writing

2:02:03.540 --> 2:02:07.540
 knowing that he was dying of cancer.

2:02:07.540 --> 2:02:11.540
 So the book was released back, it's a very thin book.

2:02:11.540 --> 2:02:15.540
 But the power,

2:02:15.540 --> 2:02:19.540
 the intellectual power in this book, in this essay

2:02:19.540 --> 2:02:23.540
 is incredible. I mean you probably know that von Neumann

2:02:23.540 --> 2:02:27.540
 is considered to be one of the biggest

2:02:27.540 --> 2:02:31.540
 thinkers. So his intellectual power was incredible.

2:02:31.540 --> 2:02:35.540
 And you can actually feel this power

2:02:35.540 --> 2:02:39.540
 in this book where the person is writing knowing that he will be,

2:02:39.540 --> 2:02:43.540
 he will die. The book actually got published only after his

2:02:43.540 --> 2:02:47.540
 death back in 1958. He died in 1957.

2:02:47.540 --> 2:02:51.540
 So he tried to put as many

2:02:51.540 --> 2:02:55.540
 ideas that he still

2:02:55.540 --> 2:02:59.540
 hadn't realized.

2:02:59.540 --> 2:03:03.540
 So this book is very difficult

2:03:03.540 --> 2:03:07.540
 to read because every single paragraph

2:03:07.540 --> 2:03:11.540
 is just compact, is

2:03:11.540 --> 2:03:15.540
 filled with these ideas. And the ideas are incredible.

2:03:15.540 --> 2:03:19.540
 Even nowadays, so he tried

2:03:19.540 --> 2:03:23.540
 to put the parallels between the brain

2:03:23.540 --> 2:03:27.540
 computing power, the neural system, and the computers

2:03:27.540 --> 2:03:31.540
 as they were understood. Do you remember what year he was working on this?

2:03:31.540 --> 2:03:35.540
 57. 57. So that was right during his,

2:03:35.540 --> 2:03:39.540
 when he was diagnosed with cancer and he was essentially...

2:03:39.540 --> 2:03:43.540
 Yeah, he's one of those, there's a few folks people mention,

2:03:43.540 --> 2:03:47.540
 I think Ed Witten is another that like

2:03:47.540 --> 2:03:51.540
 everyone that meets them, they say he's just an intellectual powerhouse.

2:03:51.540 --> 2:03:55.540
 Yes. Okay, so who's the honorable mention?

2:03:55.540 --> 2:03:59.540
 And this is, I mean, the reason I put it sort of in a separate section

2:03:59.540 --> 2:04:03.540
 because this is a book that I recently

2:04:03.540 --> 2:04:07.540
 listened to. So it's an audio book.

2:04:07.540 --> 2:04:11.540
 And this is a book called Lab Girl by Hope Jarron.

2:04:11.540 --> 2:04:15.540
 So Hope Jarron, she is a

2:04:15.540 --> 2:04:19.540
 scientist, she's a geochemist that essentially

2:04:19.540 --> 2:04:23.540
 studies the

2:04:23.540 --> 2:04:27.540
 fossil plants. And so she uses

2:04:27.540 --> 2:04:31.540
 this fossil plant, the chemical analysis to understand

2:04:31.540 --> 2:04:35.540
 what was the climate back in

2:04:35.540 --> 2:04:39.540
 a thousand years, hundreds of thousands of years ago.

2:04:39.540 --> 2:04:43.540
 And so something that incredibly

2:04:43.540 --> 2:04:47.540
 touched me by this book, it was narrated by the author.

2:04:47.540 --> 2:04:51.540
 Nice. And it's an incredibly

2:04:51.540 --> 2:04:55.540
 personal story, incredibly. So

2:04:55.540 --> 2:04:59.540
 certain parts of the book, you could actually hear the author crying.

2:04:59.540 --> 2:05:03.540
 And that to me, I mean, I never experienced

2:05:03.540 --> 2:05:07.540
 anything like this, reading the book, but it was like

2:05:07.540 --> 2:05:11.540
 the connection between you and the author.

2:05:11.540 --> 2:05:15.540
 And I think this is really

2:05:15.540 --> 2:05:19.540
 a must read, but even better, a must listen

2:05:19.540 --> 2:05:23.540
 to audio book for anyone who

2:05:23.540 --> 2:05:27.540
 wants to learn about sort of

2:05:27.540 --> 2:05:31.540
 academia, science, research in general, because it's

2:05:31.540 --> 2:05:35.540
 a very personal account about her becoming

2:05:35.540 --> 2:05:39.540
 a scientist. So

2:05:39.540 --> 2:05:43.540
 we're just before New Year's.

2:05:43.540 --> 2:05:47.540
 We talked a lot about some difficult topics of viruses and so on.

2:05:47.540 --> 2:05:51.540
 Do you have some exciting things you're looking forward

2:05:51.540 --> 2:05:55.540
 to in 2021? Some New Year's resolutions,

2:05:55.540 --> 2:05:59.540
 maybe silly or fun, or

2:05:59.540 --> 2:06:03.540
 something very important and fundamental to

2:06:03.540 --> 2:06:07.540
 the world of science or something completely unimportant?

2:06:07.540 --> 2:06:11.540
 Well, I'm definitely looking forward to

2:06:11.540 --> 2:06:15.540
 towards things becoming normal.

2:06:15.540 --> 2:06:19.540
 So yes, I really miss traveling.

2:06:19.540 --> 2:06:23.540
 Every summer I go

2:06:23.540 --> 2:06:27.540
 to an international summer school. It's called

2:06:27.540 --> 2:06:31.540
 the School for Molecular and Theoretical Biology. It's held in Europe.

2:06:31.540 --> 2:06:35.540
 It's organized by very good friends of mine. And this is

2:06:35.540 --> 2:06:39.540
 the school for gifted kids from all over the world, and

2:06:39.540 --> 2:06:43.540
 they're incredibly bright. It's like every time I go there, it's like, you know,

2:06:43.540 --> 2:06:47.540
 it's a highlight of the year. And

2:06:47.540 --> 2:06:51.540
 we couldn't make it this August, so we

2:06:51.540 --> 2:06:55.540
 did this school remotely, but it's different.

2:06:55.540 --> 2:06:59.540
 So I am definitely looking forward to next August

2:06:59.540 --> 2:07:03.540
 coming there. One of

2:07:03.540 --> 2:07:07.540
 my personal resolutions, I realized that

2:07:07.540 --> 2:07:11.540
 being in the house and working from home,

2:07:11.540 --> 2:07:15.540
 I realized that actually

2:07:15.540 --> 2:07:19.540
 I apparently missed a lot

2:07:19.540 --> 2:07:23.540
 spending time with my family,

2:07:23.540 --> 2:07:27.540
 believe it or not. So you typically, with all the

2:07:27.540 --> 2:07:31.540
 research and teaching and

2:07:31.540 --> 2:07:35.540
 everything related to the academic life,

2:07:35.540 --> 2:07:39.540
 I mean, you get distracted. And so

2:07:39.540 --> 2:07:43.540
 you don't feel that

2:07:43.540 --> 2:07:47.540
 the fact that you are away from your family doesn't affect you

2:07:47.540 --> 2:07:51.540
 because you are naturally distracted by other things.

2:07:51.540 --> 2:07:55.540
 So this time I realized that

2:07:55.540 --> 2:07:59.540
 that's so important, right? Spending your time with

2:07:59.540 --> 2:08:03.540
 the family, with your kids. And so that

2:08:03.540 --> 2:08:07.540
 would be my new year resolution and actually trying to

2:08:07.540 --> 2:08:11.540
 spend as much time as possible. Even when the world opens up.

2:08:11.540 --> 2:08:15.540
 Yeah, that's a beautiful message. That's a beautiful reminder.

2:08:15.540 --> 2:08:19.540
 I asked you if there's a Russian poem

2:08:19.540 --> 2:08:23.540
 that I could read, that I could force you to read, and you said, okay, fine, sure.

2:08:23.540 --> 2:08:27.540
 Do you mind reading?

2:08:27.540 --> 2:08:31.540
 And you said that no paper needed.

2:08:31.540 --> 2:08:35.540
 So this poem was written by my namesake,

2:08:35.540 --> 2:08:39.540
 another Dmitry, Dmitry Kemerefeld.

2:08:39.540 --> 2:08:43.540
 It's a recent poem and it's

2:08:43.540 --> 2:08:47.540
 called Sorceress, Vyadma,

2:08:47.540 --> 2:08:51.540
 in Russian, or actually

2:08:51.540 --> 2:08:55.540
 Koldunya. So that's sort of another sort of connotation of

2:08:55.540 --> 2:08:59.540
 sorceress or witch. And I really like it

2:08:59.540 --> 2:09:03.540
 and it's one of just a handful poems I actually

2:09:03.540 --> 2:09:07.540
 can recall by heart. I also have a very strong

2:09:07.540 --> 2:09:11.540
 association when I read this poem with Master and

2:09:11.540 --> 2:09:15.540
 Margarita, the main female character,

2:09:15.540 --> 2:09:19.540
 Margarita. And also it's

2:09:19.540 --> 2:09:23.540
 about, it's happening about the same time we're talking

2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:27.540
 now, so around New Year,

2:09:27.540 --> 2:09:31.540
 around Christmas. Do you mind reading it in Russian?

2:09:31.540 --> 2:09:49.540
 I'll give it a try.

2:10:01.540 --> 2:10:05.540
 So you narrowed your eyes,

2:10:05.540 --> 2:10:09.540
 that anyone who was blessed

2:10:09.540 --> 2:10:13.540
 was ready to give their soul to the devil

2:10:13.540 --> 2:10:17.540
 for this witch's connection.

2:10:17.540 --> 2:10:21.540
 And I, without prejudice,

2:10:21.540 --> 2:10:25.540
 ran out to feel your

2:10:25.540 --> 2:10:29.540
 amazing breath on your lips,

2:10:29.540 --> 2:10:33.540
 to remember how you flew above the earth

2:10:33.540 --> 2:10:37.540
 in a white view,

2:10:37.540 --> 2:10:41.540
 in a white haze, in a white mist.

2:10:41.540 --> 2:10:45.540
 That's beautiful. I love how it captures a moment of longing

2:10:45.540 --> 2:10:49.540
 and maybe love even.

2:10:49.540 --> 2:10:53.540
 Yes. To me it has a lot of meaning about

2:10:53.540 --> 2:10:57.540
 this something that is happening,

2:10:57.540 --> 2:11:01.540
 something that is far away, but still very close to you.

2:11:01.540 --> 2:11:05.540
 And yes, it's the winter.

2:11:05.540 --> 2:11:09.540
 There's something magical about winter, isn't there?

2:11:09.540 --> 2:11:13.540
 I don't know how to translate it, but a kiss in winter

2:11:13.540 --> 2:11:17.540
 is interesting. Lips in winter and all that kind of stuff.

2:11:17.540 --> 2:11:21.540
 It's beautiful. Russian has a way. It has a reason, Russian poetry

2:11:21.540 --> 2:11:25.540
 is just, I'm a fan of poetry in both languages, but English

2:11:25.540 --> 2:11:29.540
 doesn't capture some of the magic that Russian seems to, so

2:11:29.540 --> 2:11:33.540
 thank you for doing that. That was awesome. Dmitry,

2:11:33.540 --> 2:11:37.540
 it's great to talk to you again. It's contagious

2:11:37.540 --> 2:11:41.540
