00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
 The following is a conversation with Magnus Carlsen,

00:03.200 --> 00:05.360
 the number one ranked chess player in the world

00:05.360 --> 00:07.720
 and widely considered to be one of,

00:07.720 --> 00:10.320
 if not the greatest chess player of all time.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.480
 The camera on Magnus died 20 minutes into the conversation.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.920
 Most folks still just listen to the audio

00:16.920 --> 00:18.760
 through a podcast player anyway,

00:18.760 --> 00:23.120
 but if you're watching this on YouTube or Spotify,

00:23.120 --> 00:25.040
 we did our best to still make it interesting

00:25.040 --> 00:27.040
 by adding relevant image overlays.

00:27.040 --> 00:32.040
 I mess things up sometimes, like in this case,

00:32.160 --> 00:34.520
 but I'm always working hard to improve.

00:34.520 --> 00:35.880
 I hope you understand.

00:36.720 --> 00:39.880
 Thank you for your patience and support along the way.

00:39.880 --> 00:40.800
 I love you all.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.040
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

00:46.120 --> 00:47.400
 in the description.

00:47.400 --> 00:50.900
 And now, dear friends, here's Magnus Carlsen.

00:51.920 --> 00:54.680
 You're considered by many to be one of the greatest,

00:54.680 --> 00:57.160
 if not the greatest chess players of all time,

00:57.160 --> 00:59.320
 but you're also one of the best fantasy football,

00:59.320 --> 01:02.200
 AKA soccer, competitors in the world,

01:02.200 --> 01:03.580
 plus recently picking up poker

01:03.580 --> 01:06.280
 and competing at a world class level.

01:06.280 --> 01:09.820
 So before chess, let's talk football and greatness.

01:10.740 --> 01:12.880
 You're a Real Madrid fan,

01:12.880 --> 01:15.000
 so let me ask you the ridiculous big question.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.480
 Who do you think is the greatest football,

01:17.480 --> 01:19.720
 AKA soccer player of all time?

01:19.720 --> 01:22.240
 Can you make the case for Messi?

01:22.240 --> 01:25.920
 Can you make the case for Cristiano Ronaldo, Pele,

01:25.920 --> 01:28.840
 Maradona, does anybody jump to mind?

01:28.840 --> 01:30.800
 I think it's pretty hard to make a case

01:30.800 --> 01:35.800
 for anybody else than Messi for his all around game.

01:37.460 --> 01:42.220
 And frankly, my Real Madrid fandom

01:42.220 --> 01:47.220
 sort of predates the Ronaldo era,

01:47.840 --> 01:50.380
 the second Ronaldo, not the first one.

01:50.380 --> 01:51.880
 So I always liked Ronaldo,

01:51.880 --> 01:56.640
 but I always kind of thought that Messi was better.

01:56.640 --> 02:00.200
 And I went to quite a number of Madrid games

02:00.200 --> 02:03.760
 and they've always been super helpful to me down there.

02:03.760 --> 02:06.820
 The only thing is that, like they asked me,

02:06.820 --> 02:08.600
 they were gonna do an interview

02:08.600 --> 02:10.980
 and they were gonna ask me who my favorite player was.

02:10.980 --> 02:14.320
 And I said somebody else,

02:14.320 --> 02:15.920
 I think I said Isco at that point,

02:15.920 --> 02:19.480
 and I was like, okay, take two now you say Ronaldo.

02:19.480 --> 02:22.600
 So for them it was very important,

02:22.600 --> 02:26.520
 but it wasn't that huge to me.

02:26.520 --> 02:29.080
 So Messi over Maradona.

02:29.080 --> 02:32.480
 Yeah, but I think just like with chess,

02:32.480 --> 02:34.640
 it's hard to compare eras.

02:34.640 --> 02:36.480
 Obviously the improvements in football

02:36.480 --> 02:39.600
 have been like in technique and such

02:39.600 --> 02:43.240
 have been even greater than they have been in chess,

02:43.240 --> 02:48.240
 but it's always a weird discussion to have.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.320
 But just as a fan,

02:50.320 --> 02:54.400
 what do you think is beautiful about the game?

02:54.400 --> 02:55.760
 What defines greatness?

02:55.760 --> 02:58.160
 Is it, you know, with Messi,

02:58.160 --> 03:00.080
 one, he's really good at finishing,

03:00.080 --> 03:02.280
 two, very good at assist,

03:02.280 --> 03:03.640
 like three, there's just magic.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.480
 It's just beautiful to see the play.

03:05.480 --> 03:06.960
 So it's not just about the finishing.

03:06.960 --> 03:09.800
 There's some, it's like Maradona's hand of God.

03:09.800 --> 03:13.240
 There's some creativity on the pitch.

03:13.240 --> 03:15.840
 Is that important or is it very important

03:15.840 --> 03:18.200
 to get the World Cups and the big championships

03:18.200 --> 03:19.240
 and that kind of stuff?

03:19.240 --> 03:22.080
 I think the World Cup is pretty overrated,

03:22.080 --> 03:26.600
 seeing as it's such a small sample size.

03:26.600 --> 03:31.400
 So it sort of annoys me always when, you know,

03:31.400 --> 03:35.960
 titles are always appreciated so much,

03:35.960 --> 03:40.960
 even though that particular title can be a lot of luck

03:42.000 --> 03:45.160
 or at least some luck.

03:45.160 --> 03:50.160
 So I do appreciate the statistics a bit

03:50.840 --> 03:54.000
 and all the statistics say that Messi's

03:54.000 --> 03:55.840
 the best finisher of all time,

03:55.840 --> 03:58.440
 which I think helps a lot.

03:58.440 --> 04:01.400
 And then there's the intangibles as well.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.120
 The flip side of that is the small sample size

04:05.080 --> 04:10.080
 is what really creates the magic.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.680
 It's so, it's just like the Olympics.

04:12.680 --> 04:15.240
 You basically train your whole life for this.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.520
 You live your whole life for this and it's a rare moment.

04:17.520 --> 04:20.600
 One mistake and it's all over.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.920
 That's, for some reason, a lot of people

04:23.920 --> 04:25.440
 either break under that pressure

04:25.440 --> 04:26.920
 or rise up under that pressure.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.800
 You don't admire the magic of that?

04:28.800 --> 04:29.920
 No, I do.

04:29.920 --> 04:34.000
 I just think that rising under pressure

04:34.000 --> 04:36.200
 and breaking under the pressure

04:36.200 --> 04:41.200
 is often a really oversimplified take

04:41.200 --> 04:44.440
 on what's happening.

04:44.440 --> 04:46.800
 Yeah, we do romanticize the game.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.880
 Well, let me ask you another ridiculous question.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.840
 You're also a fan of basketball.

04:50.840 --> 04:51.680
 Yes.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.680
 Let me ask the goat question.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.960
 I'm biased because I went to high school in Chicago,

05:00.040 --> 05:02.400
 Chicago Bulls during the Michael Jordan era.

05:03.400 --> 05:07.360
 Let me ask the Jordan versus LeBron James question.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.240
 Let's continue on this thread of greatness.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.400
 Which one do you pick or somebody else?

05:13.240 --> 05:14.080
 Magic Johnson.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.760
 So I'll give you a completely different answer.

05:15.760 --> 05:16.600
 Uh oh.

05:17.640 --> 05:21.400
 Depending on my mood and depending on whom I talk to,

05:21.400 --> 05:24.600
 I pick one of the two and then I try to argue for that.

05:24.600 --> 05:25.680
 With the quantum mechanical thing.

05:25.680 --> 05:30.560
 Well, can you, what, again, what would,

05:30.560 --> 05:32.640
 if you were to argue for either one,

05:35.240 --> 05:36.920
 statistically, I think LeBron James

05:36.920 --> 05:38.680
 is going to surpass Jordan.

05:38.680 --> 05:39.840
 Yeah, no doubt.

05:39.840 --> 05:44.840
 And so again, there's a debate between.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.840
 Unquantifiable greatness, no?

05:46.840 --> 05:50.160
 I mean, that's the whole, that's the whole debate.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.000
 Yes.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
 So it's, well, it's quantifiable versus unquantifiable.

05:54.000 --> 05:54.840
 Yeah.

05:54.840 --> 05:55.680
 What's more important?

05:55.680 --> 05:58.240
 And you're depending on mood all over the place.

05:58.240 --> 05:59.560
 Yeah.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.520
 But what do you lean in general with these folks,

06:02.520 --> 06:04.800
 with soccer, with anything in life,

06:05.720 --> 06:07.800
 towards the unquantifiable more?

06:07.800 --> 06:10.640
 No, definitely towards the quantifiable.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.600
 So when you're unsure, lean towards the numbers.

06:12.600 --> 06:13.440
 Yeah.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.800
 But see, like, it's later generations.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.000
 There's something, that's what people say about Maradona

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
 is, you know, he took a arguably somewhat mediocre team

06:23.600 --> 06:25.320
 to a World Cup.

06:25.320 --> 06:28.760
 So there's that also uplifting nature of the player

06:28.760 --> 06:31.200
 to be able to rise up, it is a team sport.

06:31.200 --> 06:36.080
 So are you gonna, like, are you gonna punish Messi

06:36.080 --> 06:40.000
 for taking a mediocre Argentine squad

06:40.000 --> 06:43.480
 to the final in 2014 and punish him

06:43.480 --> 06:47.560
 because they lost to a great team very narrowly

06:47.560 --> 06:49.280
 after they missed?

06:49.280 --> 06:50.600
 The internet does.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.320
 He set up, like, a great chance for Higuain

06:53.320 --> 06:57.560
 in the first half, which he, which he fluffed.

06:57.560 --> 07:00.160
 And then, yeah, eventually they lost the game.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.520
 Yeah, they do criticize Cristiano Ronaldo,

07:02.520 --> 07:04.920
 Messi for being on really strong squads

07:04.920 --> 07:07.880
 in terms of the club teams and saying,

07:07.880 --> 07:10.880
 yeah, okay, it's easy when you have like Ronaldinho

07:10.880 --> 07:13.400
 or whoever on your team.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.880
 It would be very interesting

07:14.880 --> 07:18.680
 just if the league could make a decision.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.760
 Yeah, just random, random allocation.

07:21.760 --> 07:22.600
 Yeah.

07:25.720 --> 07:28.360
 And just every single game, just keep reallocating

07:28.360 --> 07:32.360
 or maybe once a season or every season you get random.

07:32.360 --> 07:36.160
 But let's say every, every player,

07:37.880 --> 07:41.640
 if let's say they sign a five year contract for a team,

07:41.640 --> 07:43.920
 like one of them, you're gonna get randomly allocated

07:43.920 --> 07:46.920
 to, to let's say a bottom half team.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.760
 I bet you there's gonna be so much corruption around that.

07:50.760 --> 07:51.600
 It could be random.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.960
 Obviously it wouldn't, wouldn't ever happen or work,

07:54.960 --> 07:57.680
 but I think it's interesting to think about.

07:57.680 --> 08:01.520
 So on chess, let's zoom out.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.480
 If you break down your approach to chess

08:04.480 --> 08:06.920
 when you're at your best,

08:06.920 --> 08:09.080
 what do you think,

08:10.920 --> 08:12.480
 what do you think contributes to that approach?

08:12.480 --> 08:15.280
 Is it memory recall, specific lines and positions?

08:15.280 --> 08:16.560
 Is it intuition?

08:16.560 --> 08:18.160
 How much of it is intuition?

08:18.160 --> 08:20.280
 How much of it is pure calculation?

08:20.280 --> 08:23.360
 How much of it is messing with the strategy of the opponent?

08:23.360 --> 08:27.000
 So the game theory aspect in terms of what contributes

08:27.000 --> 08:30.800
 to the highest level of play that you do.

08:30.800 --> 08:35.680
 I think the answer differs a little bit now

08:35.680 --> 08:39.200
 from what it did eight years ago.

08:39.200 --> 08:42.400
 For instance, like I've, I feel like I've had like two peaks

08:42.400 --> 08:45.520
 and in my career in 2014,

08:46.520 --> 08:50.600
 well, 2013, 2014, and also in 2019.

08:50.600 --> 08:54.560
 And in those years, I was very different

08:56.400 --> 09:00.160
 in terms of, of my strength,

09:00.160 --> 09:03.040
 strength as specifically in 2019,

09:03.040 --> 09:06.480
 I benefited a lot from opening preparation

09:07.680 --> 09:09.880
 while in 2013, 2014,

09:09.880 --> 09:14.880
 I mostly tried to avoid my opponent's preparation

09:15.040 --> 09:19.120
 rather than that being a, being a strength.

09:19.120 --> 09:22.600
 So I'm mentioning that also because it's something,

09:22.600 --> 09:26.360
 something you didn't, didn't mention.

09:26.360 --> 09:31.080
 I think like my intuitive understanding of chess has

09:31.080 --> 09:35.720
 over those years always been a little bit better

09:35.720 --> 09:40.040
 than the others, even though it has evolved as well.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.400
 Certainly there are, there are things that I understand now

09:44.400 --> 09:46.840
 that I didn't understand back then,

09:46.840 --> 09:51.080
 but that's not only for me, that's for, for others as well.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.160
 I was younger back then.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.040
 So I played with more energy,

09:55.040 --> 09:56.600
 which meant that I could play better

09:56.600 --> 10:00.200
 in long drawn out games,

10:01.760 --> 10:03.800
 which was also a necessity for me

10:03.800 --> 10:05.400
 because I didn't, I couldn't,

10:05.400 --> 10:09.240
 couldn't beat people in the, in the openings.

10:09.240 --> 10:12.480
 But in terms of calculation,

10:12.480 --> 10:16.200
 that's always been a weird issue for me.

10:16.200 --> 10:20.120
 Like I've always been really, really bad

10:20.120 --> 10:22.360
 at solving exercises in chess.

10:22.360 --> 10:27.360
 Like that's been like a blind spot for me.

10:28.680 --> 10:33.000
 First of all, I found it hard to concentrate on them

10:34.440 --> 10:38.840
 and to look, to look deep enough.

10:38.840 --> 10:42.480
 So this is like a puzzle, a position, mate in X.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.520
 I mean, one thing is mate, but find the best move.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.920
 That's generally the exercise,

10:46.920 --> 10:49.800
 like find the best move, find the best line.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.000
 You, you just don't connect with it.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.920
 Usually like you have to, to look, look deep.

10:54.920 --> 10:58.480
 And then when I get these lines during the game,

10:58.480 --> 11:03.480
 I very often find the, the, the right solution,

11:04.160 --> 11:09.160
 even though, even though it's not still

11:11.880 --> 11:16.880
 the best part of my game to, to calculate very, very deeply.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.920
 But it doesn't feel like calculation you're saying

11:19.920 --> 11:20.760
 in terms of.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.840
 And it does sometimes, but for me,

11:23.840 --> 11:26.240
 it's more like I'm at the board trying to find,

11:26.240 --> 11:27.480
 trying to find the solution.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.200
 And I understand like the training at home

11:30.200 --> 11:33.240
 is like trying a little bit to, to replicate that.

11:33.240 --> 11:37.280
 Like you give somebody half an hour in a position,

11:37.280 --> 11:40.320
 like in this instance, you might've thought

11:40.320 --> 11:42.400
 for half an hour if you play the game,

11:42.400 --> 11:44.960
 but I just, I just cannot do it.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.800
 One thing I know that I am good at though,

11:47.800 --> 11:52.800
 is calculating short lines because I calculate them,

11:54.560 --> 11:58.640
 them well, I'm good at seeing little details

11:58.640 --> 12:03.640
 and I'm also much better than, than most at evaluating,

12:05.320 --> 12:08.640
 which I think is something that sets me,

12:08.640 --> 12:11.800
 sets me apart from, from others.

12:11.800 --> 12:15.160
 So evaluating specific position, if I,

12:15.160 --> 12:20.160
 if I make this move and the position changes in this way,

12:20.200 --> 12:22.600
 is this a step in the right direction?

12:22.600 --> 12:24.120
 Like in a big picture way?

12:24.120 --> 12:24.960
 Yeah.

12:24.960 --> 12:27.680
 Like you calculate a few moves ahead and then you evaluate

12:27.680 --> 12:31.000
 because a lot of, a lot of time, a lot of the times

12:31.000 --> 12:34.320
 you cannot, the branches become so big

12:34.320 --> 12:35.960
 that you cannot calculate everything.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.640
 So you have to, yeah.

12:37.640 --> 12:41.200
 So you have to, you have to make evaluations based on,

12:41.200 --> 12:44.880
 you know, based mostly on knowledge

12:44.880 --> 12:49.720
 and intuition and somehow I seem to do that pretty well.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.560
 When you say you're good at short lines,

12:51.560 --> 12:53.840
 what's that, what's, what's short?

12:53.840 --> 12:58.840
 That's usually like lines of two to four moves each.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.160
 Okay, so that, that's directly applicable

13:01.160 --> 13:04.040
 to even faster games like blitz, chess and so on.

13:04.040 --> 13:09.040
 Yeah, blitz is a lot about calculating forest lines.

13:09.280 --> 13:14.280
 So those, you can see pretty clearly that the players

13:14.280 --> 13:17.240
 who struggle at blitz who are great at classical

13:17.240 --> 13:21.600
 are those who rely on a deep calculating ability

13:21.600 --> 13:24.400
 because you simply don't have time for that in blitz.

13:24.400 --> 13:29.080
 You have to calculate quickly and rely a lot on intuition.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.760
 Can you try to, I know it's really difficult.

13:30.760 --> 13:34.240
 Can you try to talk through what's actually

13:34.240 --> 13:36.280
 being visualized in your head?

13:36.280 --> 13:39.200
 Is there, is there a visual component?

13:39.200 --> 13:41.280
 Yeah, no, I just visualized the board.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.800
 I mean, the board is in my head.

13:44.800 --> 13:45.840
 Two dimensional?

13:45.840 --> 13:49.920
 My interpretation is that it is two dimensional.

13:49.920 --> 13:52.680
 Like what color is, is it brown tinted?

13:52.680 --> 13:53.560
 Is it black?

13:53.560 --> 13:56.120
 Is it, like what's the theme?

13:56.120 --> 13:58.200
 Is it a big board, small board?

13:58.200 --> 14:00.800
 Are the, what do the pawns look like?

14:01.920 --> 14:04.080
 Or is it more in the space of concepts?

14:04.080 --> 14:05.320
 Like.

14:05.320 --> 14:07.640
 Yeah, there aren't a lot of colors.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.080
 It's mostly, yeah.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.200
 So what is it?

14:11.200 --> 14:13.040
 Queen's gambit on the ceiling, whatever.

14:13.040 --> 14:16.080
 I'm trying now to imagine it.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.640
 What about when you do the branching,

14:17.640 --> 14:19.040
 when you have multiple boards and so on?

14:19.040 --> 14:20.080
 What, how does that look?

14:20.080 --> 14:20.920
 Are you?

14:20.920 --> 14:21.960
 No, but it's only one at a time.

14:21.960 --> 14:22.800
 So like.

14:22.800 --> 14:23.640
 One position at a time.

14:23.640 --> 14:24.480
 One position at a time.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.400
 So then I go back and that's what, when,

14:27.400 --> 14:30.640
 when people play, or at least that's what I do.

14:30.640 --> 14:33.400
 When I play blindfold chess against several people,

14:33.400 --> 14:35.840
 then it's just always one board at a time.

14:35.840 --> 14:39.120
 And the rest are stored away somewhere.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.440
 But how do you store them away?

14:40.440 --> 14:42.520
 So like, you went down one branch.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.480
 You're like, all right, that's, I got that.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.440
 I understand that there's some good there,

14:47.440 --> 14:48.720
 there's some bad there.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.360
 Now let me go down another branch.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.600
 Like, how do you store away the information?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.440
 You just put it on a shelf, kind of?

14:54.440 --> 14:55.960
 I try and store it away.

14:55.960 --> 14:59.400
 Sometimes I have to sort of repeat it because I forget.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.520
 And it does happen frequently in games

15:02.520 --> 15:06.920
 that you're thinking for,

15:06.920 --> 15:08.520
 especially if you're thinking for a long,

15:08.520 --> 15:09.960
 let's say a half an hour,

15:09.960 --> 15:12.920
 or even more than that, that you play a move

15:12.920 --> 15:14.720
 and then your opponent plays a move,

15:14.720 --> 15:17.160
 then you play a move and they play a move again.

15:17.160 --> 15:20.120
 And you realize, oh, I actually calculated that.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.280
 I just forgot about it.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.280
 So that's obviously what happens

15:24.280 --> 15:26.600
 when you store the information and you cannot retrieve it.

15:26.600 --> 15:30.120
 When you think about a move for 20, 30 minutes,

15:30.120 --> 15:32.360
 like how do you break that down?

15:32.360 --> 15:33.520
 Can you describe what,

15:35.360 --> 15:36.720
 like what's the algorithm here

15:36.720 --> 15:38.680
 that takes 30 minutes to run?

15:38.680 --> 15:43.120
 30 minutes is, at least for me, it's usually a waste.

15:44.200 --> 15:47.000
 30 minutes usually means that I don't know what to do.

15:47.920 --> 15:48.760
 And I'm trying.

15:48.760 --> 15:49.840
 You're just running into the wall over and over.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.120
 Yeah, I'm trying to find something that isn't there.

15:52.120 --> 15:55.640
 I think 10 to 15 minutes things

15:55.640 --> 16:00.000
 in complicated positions can be really, really helpful.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
 Then you can spend your time pretty efficiently.

16:05.360 --> 16:10.360
 Just means that the branches are getting wide.

16:10.360 --> 16:15.360
 There's a lot to run through,

16:15.560 --> 16:17.280
 both in terms of calculation

16:17.280 --> 16:20.000
 and lots you have to evaluate as well.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.960
 And then based on that 10 to 15 minute thing,

16:24.960 --> 16:29.280
 you have a pretty good idea what to do.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.520
 I mean, it's very rare that I would think for half an hour

16:32.520 --> 16:35.600
 and I would have a eureka moment during the game.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.560
 Like if I haven't seen it in 10 minutes,

16:37.560 --> 16:39.800
 I'm probably not gonna see it at all.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.280
 You're going to different branches.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.120
 Yeah.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.840
 And like after 15 minutes, it's like.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.280
 But it mainly to the middle game,

16:45.280 --> 16:47.120
 because when you get to the end game,

16:47.120 --> 16:50.320
 it's usually brute force calculation

16:50.320 --> 16:52.920
 that makes you spend so much time.

16:52.920 --> 16:55.600
 So middle game is normally,

16:55.600 --> 16:59.520
 it's a complicated mix of brute force calculation

16:59.520 --> 17:04.520
 and like creativity and evaluation.

17:05.800 --> 17:10.000
 So end game, it's easier in that sense.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.280
 Well, you're good at every aspect of chess,

17:14.280 --> 17:16.600
 but you're also your end game is legendary.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.320
 It baffles experts.

17:18.320 --> 17:21.040
 So can you linger on that then try to explain

17:21.040 --> 17:22.240
 what the heck is going on there?

17:22.240 --> 17:23.480
 Like if you look at game six

17:23.480 --> 17:26.560
 of the previous world championship,

17:26.560 --> 17:31.360
 the longest game ever played in chess,

17:31.360 --> 17:36.360
 it was I think his queen versus your rook knight in two pawns.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.360
 There's so many options there.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.560
 It's such an interesting little dance

17:42.560 --> 17:45.280
 and it's kind of not obvious that it wouldn't be a draw.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.960
 So how do you escape it not being a draw

17:47.960 --> 17:49.720
 and you win that match?

17:49.720 --> 17:53.360
 No, I knew that for most of the time,

17:53.360 --> 17:55.800
 it was a theoretical draw

17:55.800 --> 18:00.800
 since chess with seven or less pieces on the board is solved.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.360
 So you can, like people watching online,

18:04.360 --> 18:05.320
 they can just check it.

18:05.320 --> 18:09.480
 They can check and they can check a so called table base

18:09.480 --> 18:13.600
 and they, it just gonna spit out win for white,

18:13.600 --> 18:15.040
 win for black or draw.

18:15.040 --> 18:18.120
 So, and also I knew that,

18:18.120 --> 18:21.360
 I knew that didn't know that position specifically,

18:21.360 --> 18:23.760
 but I knew that it had to be a draw.

18:23.760 --> 18:28.760
 So for me, it was about staying alert.

18:29.640 --> 18:33.920
 First of all, trying to look for the best way

18:33.920 --> 18:37.720
 to put my pieces, but yeah,

18:37.720 --> 18:40.480
 those end games are a bit, they're a bit unusual.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.120
 They don't happen too often.

18:43.120 --> 18:47.440
 So what I'm usually good at is I'm using my strength

18:47.440 --> 18:50.120
 that I also use in middle games

18:50.120 --> 18:53.160
 is that I evaluate well

18:53.160 --> 18:56.520
 and I calculate short variations quite.

18:56.520 --> 18:58.440
 Even for the end game, short variations matter?

18:58.440 --> 19:01.840
 Yes, it does matter in some simpler end games.

19:01.840 --> 19:06.840
 Yeah, but also like there are these theoretical end games

19:07.000 --> 19:10.320
 with very few pieces like rook knights

19:10.320 --> 19:12.160
 and two pawns versus Queens,

19:12.160 --> 19:14.640
 but a lot of end games are simply defined

19:14.640 --> 19:16.800
 by the Queens being exchanged

19:16.800 --> 19:18.680
 and there are a lot of other pieces left

19:18.680 --> 19:21.680
 and then it's usually not brute force.

19:21.680 --> 19:26.120
 It's usually more of understanding and evaluation

19:26.120 --> 19:30.800
 and then I can use my strengths very well.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.560
 Why are you so damn good at the end game?

19:32.560 --> 19:36.480
 Isn't there a lot of moves from when the end game starts

19:36.480 --> 19:38.640
 to when the end game finishes and you have a few pieces

19:38.640 --> 19:39.880
 and you have to figure out,

19:39.880 --> 19:43.520
 it's like a sequence of little games that happens, right?

19:43.520 --> 19:44.840
 Like little pattern.

19:44.840 --> 19:47.880
 Like how does it being able to evaluate a single position

19:47.880 --> 19:51.880
 lead you to evaluate a long sequence of positions

19:51.880 --> 19:53.840
 that eventually lead to a checkmate?

19:53.840 --> 19:57.680
 Well, I think if you evaluate well at the start,

19:57.680 --> 19:59.640
 you know what plans to go for

19:59.640 --> 20:02.000
 and then usually the play from there

20:02.000 --> 20:04.760
 is often pretty simple.

20:04.760 --> 20:09.760
 Let's say you understand how to arrange your pieces

20:11.320 --> 20:14.880
 and often also how to arrange your pawns

20:14.880 --> 20:19.880
 early in the end game then that makes all the difference

20:21.480 --> 20:26.480
 and after that is like what we call technique very often

20:28.320 --> 20:31.640
 that it's technique basically just means

20:31.640 --> 20:36.160
 that the moves are simple and these are moves

20:36.160 --> 20:39.440
 that a lot of players could make

20:39.440 --> 20:42.080
 not only the very strongest ones.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.560
 These are moves that are kind of understood

20:44.560 --> 20:45.840
 and known.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.120
 So with the evaluation,

20:47.120 --> 20:49.280
 you're just constantly improving a little bit

20:49.280 --> 20:51.880
 and that just leads to suffocating the position

20:51.880 --> 20:53.080
 and then eventually to the win

20:53.080 --> 20:55.560
 as long as you're doing the evaluation well,

20:55.560 --> 20:56.680
 one step at a time.

20:56.680 --> 20:57.920
 To some extent.

20:57.920 --> 21:01.160
 Also, yeah, I said like if you evaluate it better

21:01.160 --> 21:05.440
 and thus accumulated some small advantages

21:05.440 --> 21:10.440
 then you can often make your life pretty easy

21:10.600 --> 21:12.160
 towards the end of the end game.

21:12.160 --> 21:16.360
 So you said in 2019 sort of the second phase

21:16.360 --> 21:18.160
 of why you're so damn good.

21:18.160 --> 21:21.040
 You did a lot of opening preparation.

21:21.040 --> 21:26.040
 What's the goal for you of the opening game of chess?

21:26.760 --> 21:31.040
 Is it to throw the opponent off from any prepared lines?

21:31.040 --> 21:33.080
 Is there something you could put into words

21:33.080 --> 21:35.960
 about why you're so damn good at the openings?

21:35.960 --> 21:40.000
 Again, these things have changed a lot over time.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.200
 Back in Kasparov's days, for instance,

21:43.200 --> 21:46.840
 he very often got huge advantages

21:46.840 --> 21:49.440
 from the opening as white.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.120
 Can you explain why?

21:51.120 --> 21:54.400
 There were several reasons for that.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.520
 First of all, he worked harder.

21:56.520 --> 21:59.320
 He was more creative in finding ideas.

21:59.320 --> 22:03.120
 He was able to look places others didn't.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.600
 Also, he had a very strong team of people

22:05.600 --> 22:10.600
 who had specific strengths in openings that he could use.

22:11.680 --> 22:13.000
 So they would come up with ideas

22:13.000 --> 22:15.800
 and he would integrate those ideas into...

22:15.800 --> 22:17.280
 Yeah, and he would also very often

22:17.280 --> 22:19.840
 come up with them himself.

22:19.840 --> 22:24.840
 Also, at the start, he had some of the first computer engines

22:26.920 --> 22:31.480
 to work for him to find his ideas,

22:31.480 --> 22:34.360
 to look deeper, to verify his ideas.

22:34.360 --> 22:39.160
 He was better at using them than a lot of others.

22:39.160 --> 22:44.160
 Now, I feel like the playing field is a lot more level.

22:44.240 --> 22:48.960
 There are both computer engines, neural networks,

22:48.960 --> 22:53.840
 and hybrid engines available to practically anybody.

22:53.840 --> 22:58.840
 So it's much harder to find ideas now

22:59.000 --> 23:03.320
 that actually give you an advantage

23:03.320 --> 23:05.240
 with the white pieces.

23:05.240 --> 23:08.360
 I mean, people don't expect to find those ideas anymore.

23:08.360 --> 23:11.720
 Now it's all about finding ideas

23:11.720 --> 23:15.840
 that are missed by the engines.

23:15.840 --> 23:18.960
 Either they're missed entirely

23:18.960 --> 23:20.960
 or they're missed at low depth

23:22.280 --> 23:26.040
 and using them to gain some advantage

23:26.040 --> 23:28.440
 in the sense that you have more knowledge.

23:28.440 --> 23:33.440
 And it's also good to know that usually

23:34.240 --> 23:37.360
 these are not complete bluffs, these are like semi bluffs

23:37.360 --> 23:39.520
 so that you know that even if your opponent

23:39.520 --> 23:43.320
 makes all the right moves, you can still make a draw.

23:43.320 --> 23:46.960
 And also at the start of 2019,

23:46.960 --> 23:50.680
 neural networks had just started to be a thing in chess.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.960
 And I'm not entirely sure,

23:52.960 --> 23:55.120
 but there were at least some players

23:55.120 --> 24:00.120
 even in the top events who you could see did not use them

24:00.320 --> 24:02.320
 or did not use them in the right way.

24:02.320 --> 24:04.920
 And then you could gain a huge advantage

24:04.920 --> 24:06.720
 because a lot of positions,

24:06.720 --> 24:09.520
 they were being evaluated differently

24:09.520 --> 24:13.000
 by the neural networks than traditional chess engines

24:13.000 --> 24:15.920
 because they simply think about chess

24:15.920 --> 24:18.760
 in a very, very different way.

24:18.760 --> 24:21.760
 So short answer is these days,

24:21.760 --> 24:25.240
 it's all about surprising your opponent

24:25.240 --> 24:29.360
 and taking it into positions where you have more knowledge.

24:29.360 --> 24:31.960
 So is there some sense in which it's okay

24:31.960 --> 24:34.840
 to make suboptimal quote unquote moves?

24:34.840 --> 24:36.240
 No, you have to.

24:36.240 --> 24:39.560
 I mean, you have to because the best moves

24:39.560 --> 24:42.600
 have been analyzed to death mostly.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.640
 So that's a kind of, when you say semi bluff,

24:44.640 --> 24:46.600
 that's a kind of sacrifice.

24:46.600 --> 24:50.000
 You're sacrificing the optimal move,

24:50.000 --> 24:53.960
 the optimal position so that you can take the opponent.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.880
 I mean, that's a game theoretic sense.

24:55.880 --> 24:59.080
 You take the opponent to something they didn't prepare well.

24:59.080 --> 25:02.400
 Yeah, but you could also look at it another way

25:02.400 --> 25:07.320
 that regardless, like if you turn on whatever engine

25:07.320 --> 25:09.520
 you turn on, like if you try to analyze

25:09.520 --> 25:11.480
 either from the starting position

25:11.480 --> 25:15.000
 or the starting position of some popular opening,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.480
 like if you analyze long enough,

25:17.480 --> 25:19.400
 it's always gonna end up in a draw.

25:19.400 --> 25:23.200
 So in that sense, you may not be going

25:23.200 --> 25:26.040
 for like the objective, the tries

25:26.040 --> 25:29.800
 that are objectively the most difficult to draw against,

25:29.800 --> 25:32.640
 but you are trying to look at least

25:32.640 --> 25:35.400
 at the less obvious paths.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.680
 How much do you use engines?

25:37.680 --> 25:41.920
 Do you use Leela, Stockfish in your preparations?

25:41.920 --> 25:43.600
 My team does.

25:43.600 --> 25:47.880
 Personally, I try not to use them too much

25:47.880 --> 25:51.920
 on my own because I know that when I play,

25:51.920 --> 25:54.960
 you obviously cannot have help from engines.

25:54.960 --> 25:59.480
 And often I feel like often having imperfect

26:01.000 --> 26:05.080
 or knowledge about a position or some engine knowledge

26:05.080 --> 26:09.520
 can be a lot worse than having no knowledge.

26:09.520 --> 26:13.400
 So I try to look at engines as little as possible.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.840
 So yeah, so your team uses them for research

26:15.840 --> 26:17.320
 for a generation of ideas.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.160
 Yeah.

26:18.160 --> 26:23.160
 But you are relying primarily on your human resources.

26:23.600 --> 26:24.440
 Yeah, for sure.

26:24.440 --> 26:26.000
 You can evaluate well.

26:26.000 --> 26:26.840
 You don't lean.

26:26.840 --> 26:29.000
 Yeah, I can evaluate as a human.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.320
 I can know what they find unpleasant and so on.

26:33.320 --> 26:38.320
 And it's very often the case for me to some extent,

26:38.480 --> 26:42.200
 but a lot for others that you arrive in a position

26:43.320 --> 26:46.240
 and your opponent plays a move that you didn't expect

26:46.240 --> 26:49.520
 and if you didn't expect it,

26:49.520 --> 26:51.840
 you know that it's probably not a great move

26:51.840 --> 26:54.520
 since it hasn't been expected by the engine.

26:54.520 --> 26:59.520
 But if it's not obvious why it's not a good move,

27:00.480 --> 27:03.840
 it's usually very, very hard to figure it out.

27:03.840 --> 27:08.360
 And so then looking at the engines doesn't necessarily help

27:08.360 --> 27:10.920
 because at that point, like you're facing a human,

27:10.920 --> 27:14.040
 you have to sort of think as a human.

27:14.040 --> 27:16.720
 I was chatting with Demis Ashabis, CEO of DeepMind

27:16.720 --> 27:19.080
 a couple of days ago and he asked me to ask you

27:19.080 --> 27:24.080
 about what you first felt when you saw the play of AlphaZero.

27:24.920 --> 27:28.720
 Like interesting ideas in your creativity.

27:28.720 --> 27:31.480
 Did you feel fear that the machine is taking over?

27:31.480 --> 27:32.880
 Were you inspired?

27:34.000 --> 27:37.240
 And what was going on in your mind and heart?

27:37.240 --> 27:42.240
 Funny thing about Demis is he doesn't play chess at all

27:42.240 --> 27:47.240
 like an AI, he plays in a very, very human way.

27:48.560 --> 27:53.320
 No, I was hugely inspired when I saw the games at first.

27:54.360 --> 27:58.200
 And in terms of man versus machine,

27:58.200 --> 28:02.080
 I mean that battle was kind of lost for humans

28:02.080 --> 28:07.080
 even before I entered top level chess.

28:07.960 --> 28:10.440
 So that's never been an issue for me.

28:10.440 --> 28:14.200
 I never liked playing against computers much anyway.

28:14.200 --> 28:16.080
 So that's completely fine.

28:16.080 --> 28:20.400
 But it was amazing to see how they quote unquote

28:20.400 --> 28:23.480
 thought about chess in such a different way

28:23.480 --> 28:27.640
 and in a way that you could mistake for creativity.

28:27.640 --> 28:30.480
 Mistake for creativity, strong words.

28:30.480 --> 28:33.400
 Is it wild to you how many sacrifices it's willing to make

28:33.400 --> 28:36.000
 that like sacrifice pieces and then wait

28:36.000 --> 28:37.320
 for prolonged periods of time

28:37.320 --> 28:38.960
 before doing anything with that?

28:38.960 --> 28:42.440
 Is that weird to you that that's part of chess?

28:42.440 --> 28:46.520
 No, it's one of the things that's hardest to replicate

28:46.520 --> 28:50.640
 as a human as well, or at least for my playing style

28:50.640 --> 28:54.840
 that usually when I sacrifice, I feel like I'm,

28:56.360 --> 28:58.880
 I don't do it unless I feel like I'm getting something

28:58.880 --> 29:03.360
 like tangible in return and.

29:03.360 --> 29:05.000
 Like a few moves down the line.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.200
 A few moves down the line,

29:06.200 --> 29:08.760
 you can see that you can either retrieve the material

29:08.760 --> 29:12.240
 or you can put your opponent's king under pressure

29:12.240 --> 29:16.680
 or have some very like very concrete positional advantage

29:16.680 --> 29:20.520
 that sort of compensates for it.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.840
 For instance, in chess,

29:22.840 --> 29:25.640
 so bishops and knights are fairly equivalent.

29:26.720 --> 29:28.600
 We both give them three points,

29:28.600 --> 29:30.320
 but bishops are a little bit better.

29:30.320 --> 29:33.360
 And especially a bishop pair is a lot better

29:33.360 --> 29:36.080
 than a bishop and a knight.

29:36.080 --> 29:40.440
 So, or especially two knights depends on the position,

29:40.440 --> 29:44.120
 but like on average they are.

29:44.120 --> 29:49.120
 So like sacrificing a pawn in order to get a bishop pair,

29:49.720 --> 29:52.360
 that's one of the most common sacrifices in chess.

29:52.360 --> 29:53.560
 Oh, you're okay making that sacrifice?

29:53.560 --> 29:55.720
 Yeah, I mean, it depends on the situation,

29:55.720 --> 29:57.600
 but generally that's fine.

29:57.600 --> 30:00.040
 And there are a lot of openings that are based on that,

30:00.040 --> 30:03.360
 that you sacrifice a pawn for the bishop pair,

30:03.360 --> 30:07.360
 and then eventually it's some sort of positional equality.

30:07.360 --> 30:08.440
 So that's fine.

30:08.440 --> 30:13.440
 But the way AlphaZero would sacrifice a knight

30:14.640 --> 30:18.440
 or sometimes two pawns, three pawns,

30:18.440 --> 30:20.000
 and you could see that it's looking

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
 for some sort of positional domination,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.320
 but it's hard to understand.

30:24.320 --> 30:27.800
 And it was really fascinating to see.

30:27.800 --> 30:32.800
 Yeah, in 2019, I was sacrificing a lot of pawns,

30:33.520 --> 30:36.560
 especially, and it was a great joy.

30:36.560 --> 30:40.000
 Unfortunately, it's not so easy to continue to do that.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
 People have found more solid opening lines since

30:45.400 --> 30:48.760
 that don't allow me to do that as often.

30:48.760 --> 30:51.200
 I'm still trying both to get those positions

30:51.200 --> 30:56.200
 and still trying to learn the art of sacrificing pieces.

30:56.200 --> 31:01.200
 So Demis also made a comment that was interesting

31:01.200 --> 31:04.440
 to my new chess brain, which is one of the reasons

31:04.440 --> 31:06.600
 that chess is fun is because of the, quote,

31:06.600 --> 31:09.440
 creative tension between the bishop and the knight.

31:09.440 --> 31:13.360
 So you're talking about this interesting difference

31:13.360 --> 31:16.520
 between the two pieces, that there's some kind of,

31:16.520 --> 31:17.680
 how would you convert that?

31:17.680 --> 31:20.420
 I mean, that's like a poetic statement about chess.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.820
 I think he said that, why has chess been played

31:22.820 --> 31:24.020
 for such a long time?

31:24.020 --> 31:26.800
 Why is it so fun to play at every level?

31:26.800 --> 31:28.640
 That if you can reduce it to one thing,

31:28.640 --> 31:31.280
 is it the bishop and the knight,

31:31.280 --> 31:34.400
 some kind of weird dynamics that they create in chess.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.460
 Is there any truth to that?

31:36.460 --> 31:38.320
 It sounds very good.

31:38.320 --> 31:41.000
 I haven't tried a lot of other games,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.460
 but I tried to play a little bit of shogi.

31:43.460 --> 31:48.200
 And for my new shogi brain, comparing it to chess,

31:48.200 --> 31:53.000
 what annoyed me about that game is how much the pieces suck.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.480
 Basically, you have one rook and you have one bishop

31:55.480 --> 31:56.800
 that move like in chess.

31:56.800 --> 32:01.720
 And the rest of the pieces are really not very powerful.

32:01.720 --> 32:05.560
 So I think that's one of the attractions of chess,

32:05.560 --> 32:10.400
 like how powerful, especially the queen is, which.

32:10.400 --> 32:11.280
 Interesting.

32:11.280 --> 32:14.480
 I kind of think makes it a lot of fun.

32:14.480 --> 32:19.480
 So you think power is more fun than like variety?

32:19.480 --> 32:23.520
 No, there is a variety in chess as well, though.

32:23.520 --> 32:27.720
 But not much more so than like go or something.

32:27.720 --> 32:29.680
 No, no, no, no, that's for.

32:29.680 --> 32:32.560
 So like knight, I mean, they all move in different ways.

32:32.560 --> 32:33.920
 They're all like weird.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.300
 There's just all these weird patterns and positions

32:36.300 --> 32:37.440
 that can emerge.

32:37.440 --> 32:39.160
 The difference in the pieces create

32:39.160 --> 32:40.440
 all kinds of interesting dynamics,

32:40.440 --> 32:41.480
 I guess is what I'm trying to say.

32:41.480 --> 32:44.880
 Yeah, and I guess it is quite fascinating

32:44.880 --> 32:47.080
 that all those years ago,

32:47.080 --> 32:50.280
 they created the knight and the bishop

32:50.280 --> 32:53.720
 without probably realizing that they would be

32:53.720 --> 32:57.680
 almost equally strong with such different qualities.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.600
 That's crazy that this, you know,

32:59.600 --> 33:02.040
 like when you design computer games,

33:02.040 --> 33:03.400
 it's like an art form.

33:03.400 --> 33:06.120
 It's science and an art to balance it.

33:06.120 --> 33:09.440
 You know, you talk about Starcraft and all those games,

33:09.440 --> 33:12.080
 like so that you can have competitive play

33:12.080 --> 33:16.080
 at the highest level with all those different units.

33:16.080 --> 33:19.240
 In the case of chess, it's different pieces.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.440
 And they somehow designed a game

33:21.440 --> 33:22.800
 that was super competitive.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.540
 But there's probably some kind of natural selection

33:24.540 --> 33:27.560
 that the chess just wouldn't last if it was designed poorly.

33:27.560 --> 33:32.380
 Yeah, and I think the rules have changed over time

33:32.380 --> 33:35.120
 a little bit, but I would be,

33:35.120 --> 33:37.680
 I mean, speaking of games and all that,

33:37.680 --> 33:42.680
 I'm also interested to play other games like chess 960

33:42.680 --> 33:46.040
 or Fisher random, as they call it,

33:46.040 --> 33:50.560
 like that you have 960 maps instead of one.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.360
 Yeah, so for people who don't know,

33:52.360 --> 33:54.680
 a Fisher random chess, chess 960s.

33:54.680 --> 33:56.160
 Yeah, that basically just means

33:56.160 --> 33:57.720
 that the pawns are in the same way

33:57.720 --> 34:02.720
 and the major pieces are distributed randomly

34:03.100 --> 34:04.520
 on the last rank.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.400
 Only that there have to be obviously

34:06.400 --> 34:07.800
 bishops of opposite color

34:07.800 --> 34:10.400
 and the king has to be in between the rooks

34:10.400 --> 34:12.460
 so that you can castle both ways.

34:12.460 --> 34:13.800
 Oh, you can still castle in chess 960.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.440
 You can still castle, but it makes it interesting.

34:16.440 --> 34:20.600
 So you still have, it still castles in the same way.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.960
 So let's say the king is like here.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.120
 Yeah, what happens in that case?

34:24.120 --> 34:26.600
 Yeah, let's say the king is in the corner.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.800
 So to castle this side,

34:29.800 --> 34:32.300
 you have to clear a whole lot of pieces.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.320
 Well, what would castling look like though?

34:35.320 --> 34:38.080
 No, the king would go here and the rook would go there.

34:38.080 --> 34:39.400
 Oh, okay.

34:39.400 --> 34:41.680
 And that's happened in my games as well.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.720
 Like I forgot about castling

34:43.720 --> 34:46.800
 and I've been like attacking a king over here

34:46.800 --> 34:50.560
 and then all of a sudden it escapes to the other side.

34:50.560 --> 34:55.560
 I think Fischer chess is good that it's,

34:57.000 --> 35:02.000
 the maps will generally be worse than regular chess.

35:03.320 --> 35:08.320
 Like I think the starting position is as close to ideal

35:08.480 --> 35:11.600
 for creating a competitive game as possible,

35:11.600 --> 35:14.760
 but they will still be like interesting and diverse enough

35:14.760 --> 35:18.440
 that you can play very interesting games.

35:18.440 --> 35:21.060
 So when you say maps, there's 960 different options

35:21.060 --> 35:24.840
 and like what fraction of that creates interesting games

35:24.840 --> 35:26.080
 at the highest level?

35:26.080 --> 35:28.600
 This is something that a lot of people are curious about

35:28.600 --> 35:32.120
 because when you challenge a great chess player

35:32.120 --> 35:37.120
 like yourself to look at a random starting position

35:38.160 --> 35:41.200
 that feels like it pushes you to play pure chess

35:41.200 --> 35:42.400
 versus memorizing lines.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.800
 Oh yeah, for sure, for sure.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.680
 But that's the whole idea.

35:45.680 --> 35:47.280
 That's what you want.

35:47.280 --> 35:48.120
 How hard is it to play?

35:48.120 --> 35:50.560
 I mean, can you talk about what it feels like to you

35:50.560 --> 35:53.020
 to play with a random starting position?

35:53.020 --> 35:55.480
 Is there some intuition you've been building up?

35:55.480 --> 35:57.220
 It's very, very different.

35:57.220 --> 36:02.040
 And I mean, understandably engines have

36:02.040 --> 36:05.080
 an even greater advantage in 960

36:05.080 --> 36:08.440
 than they have in classical chess.

36:08.440 --> 36:10.160
 No, it's super interesting.

36:10.160 --> 36:13.880
 And that's why also I really wish

36:13.880 --> 36:17.800
 that we played more classical chess,

36:17.800 --> 36:21.640
 like long games, four to seven hours

36:21.640 --> 36:25.840
 and in fish random chess, chess 960,

36:25.840 --> 36:29.720
 because then you really need that time,

36:29.720 --> 36:31.400
 even on the first moves.

36:31.400 --> 36:34.040
 What usually happens is that you get 15 minutes

36:34.040 --> 36:36.280
 before the game, you're getting told the position

36:36.280 --> 36:37.780
 15 minutes before the game,

36:37.780 --> 36:40.520
 and then you can think about it a little bit,

36:40.520 --> 36:42.760
 even, you know, check the computer,

36:42.760 --> 36:45.200
 but that's all the time you have,

36:45.200 --> 36:46.840
 but then you really need to figure it out.

36:46.840 --> 36:50.880
 And like some of the positions obviously

36:50.880 --> 36:53.360
 are a lot more interesting than the others.

36:53.360 --> 36:55.320
 In some of them, it appears that like,

36:55.320 --> 37:00.280
 if you don't play symmetrically at the start,

37:00.280 --> 37:03.840
 then you're probably gonna be in a pretty bad position.

37:03.840 --> 37:04.960
 What do you mean with the pawns?

37:04.960 --> 37:06.480
 With the pawns, yeah.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.320
 Why does that make sense?

37:08.320 --> 37:09.980
 That's the thing about chess though.

37:09.980 --> 37:13.160
 So let's say white opens with E4,

37:13.160 --> 37:17.360
 which is, which has always been the most played move.

37:17.360 --> 37:18.880
 There are many ways to meet that,

37:18.880 --> 37:21.400
 but the most solid ways of playing

37:21.400 --> 37:23.240
 has always been the symmetrical response.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.080
 Yeah.

37:24.080 --> 37:26.320
 With E5, and then there's the,

37:26.320 --> 37:30.640
 through Lopez, there's the Petrov opening and so on.

37:30.640 --> 37:35.640
 And if you just banned symmetry on the first move in chess,

37:35.640 --> 37:37.720
 you would get more interesting games.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.040
 Oh, interesting.

37:39.040 --> 37:43.500
 Or you'd get more decisive, decisive games.

37:43.500 --> 37:45.280
 So that's the good thing about chess

37:45.280 --> 37:46.720
 is that we've played it so long

37:46.720 --> 37:50.140
 that we've actually devised non symmetrical openings

37:50.140 --> 37:53.640
 that are also fairly equal and.

37:53.640 --> 37:55.320
 But symmetry is a good default.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.020
 But yeah, symmetry is a good default.

37:57.020 --> 38:00.880
 And it's a problem that by playing symmetrical

38:00.880 --> 38:03.640
 armed with good preparation in regular chess,

38:03.640 --> 38:06.840
 it's just a little bit too easy to,

38:06.840 --> 38:08.400
 it's a little bit too dryish.

38:08.400 --> 38:11.960
 And I guess if you analyzed,

38:11.960 --> 38:14.800
 if you analyzed a lot in chess 960,

38:14.800 --> 38:19.480
 then the, a lot of the positions

38:19.480 --> 38:24.200
 would end up being pretty dryish as well.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.960
 Because the random starting points are so shitty,

38:26.960 --> 38:28.160
 you're forced to.

38:28.160 --> 38:30.480
 You're actually forced to play symmetrically.

38:30.480 --> 38:33.280
 Like you cannot actually try and play

38:33.280 --> 38:36.540
 in a more sort of interesting, interesting manner.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.280
 Is there any other kind of variations

38:39.280 --> 38:41.360
 that are interesting to you?

38:41.360 --> 38:43.640
 Oh yeah, there are, there are several.

38:43.640 --> 38:46.300
 So no castling chess has been,

38:47.440 --> 38:50.560
 has been promoted by former world champion,

38:50.560 --> 38:52.200
 Vladimir Kramnik.

38:52.200 --> 38:55.040
 There have been a few tournaments with that,

38:55.040 --> 38:59.280
 not any that I've participated in though.

38:59.280 --> 39:00.740
 I kind of like it.

39:00.740 --> 39:05.680
 Also, my coach uses like non castling engines quite a bit

39:05.680 --> 39:08.520
 to analyze regular positions

39:08.520 --> 39:13.280
 to just to get a different, different perspective.

39:13.280 --> 39:15.160
 So castling is like a defensive thing.

39:15.160 --> 39:16.800
 So if you remove castling,

39:16.800 --> 39:19.240
 it forces you to be more offensive, is that why?

39:19.240 --> 39:23.240
 Yeah, it just, yeah, for sure.

39:23.240 --> 39:26.240
 It seems like a tiny little difference.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.420
 No castling probably forces you

39:28.420 --> 39:31.880
 to be a little bit more defensive at the start,

39:31.880 --> 39:33.760
 or I would guess so,

39:33.760 --> 39:37.560
 because you cannot suddenly escape with the kings.

39:37.560 --> 39:40.040
 It's going to make the game a bit slower at the start,

39:40.040 --> 39:43.360
 but I feel like eventually it's going to,

39:45.680 --> 39:47.680
 it's going to make the more games more,

39:48.960 --> 39:51.360
 well, less droish for sure.

39:51.360 --> 39:53.760
 Then you have some weirder variants,

39:53.760 --> 39:58.760
 like where the pawns can move both diagonally and forward.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.700
 And also you have self capture chess,

40:04.700 --> 40:06.440
 which is quite interesting.

40:06.440 --> 40:08.000
 So that pawns can,

40:08.000 --> 40:10.440
 or pieces could commit suicide or what?

40:10.440 --> 40:11.480
 Yeah, people can.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.920
 Why would that be a good move?

40:13.920 --> 40:17.640
 No, sometimes one of your pieces occupy a square.

40:17.640 --> 40:20.880
 I mean, let me just set up a position.

40:20.880 --> 40:25.880
 Let's put it like this, for instance, like here.

40:26.560 --> 40:29.520
 I mean, there are a lot of ways to checkmate for white,

40:29.520 --> 40:32.640
 like this for instance, or there are several ways,

40:32.640 --> 40:36.620
 but like this would be a checkmate.

40:36.620 --> 40:38.160
 Oh, cool.

40:38.160 --> 40:39.400
 For people who are just listening,

40:39.400 --> 40:42.040
 yeah, basically you're bringing in a knight close

40:42.040 --> 40:45.080
 to the whole, the king, the queen and so on,

40:45.080 --> 40:46.880
 and you replace the knight with a queen.

40:46.880 --> 40:47.800
 Yeah, that's interesting.

40:47.800 --> 40:51.840
 So you can have like a front of pieces,

40:51.840 --> 40:54.280
 and then you just replace them with the second piece.

40:54.280 --> 40:56.600
 Yeah, I mean, that could be interesting.

40:56.600 --> 41:00.480
 I think also maybe sometimes it's just clearance,

41:00.480 --> 41:04.880
 basically it adds an extra element of clearance.

41:04.880 --> 41:09.680
 So I think there are many, many different variants.

41:09.680 --> 41:13.800
 I don't think any of them are better than the one

41:13.800 --> 41:17.120
 that has been played for at least a thousand years,

41:17.120 --> 41:22.120
 but it's certainly interesting to see.

41:22.360 --> 41:24.000
 So one of your goals is to reach

41:24.000 --> 41:27.880
 the FIDEELO chess rating of 2900.

41:27.880 --> 41:30.360
 Maybe you can comment on how is this rating calculated

41:30.360 --> 41:33.560
 and what does it take to get there?

41:33.560 --> 41:36.160
 Is it possible for a human being to get there?

41:36.160 --> 41:39.800
 Basically you play with a factor of 10,

41:39.800 --> 41:44.120
 which means that if I were to play against an opponent

41:44.120 --> 41:48.040
 who's rated the same as me, I would be expected

41:49.120 --> 41:51.240
 to score 50%, obviously, and that means

41:51.240 --> 41:54.360
 that I would win five points with a win,

41:54.360 --> 41:57.760
 lose five points with a draw, and then equal if I draw.

41:57.760 --> 42:00.800
 If your opponent is 200 points lower rated,

42:00.800 --> 42:05.720
 you're expected to score 75% and so on.

42:05.720 --> 42:08.080
 And you establish that rating by playing a lot of people,

42:08.080 --> 42:11.040
 and then it slowly converges towards an estimate

42:11.040 --> 42:13.240
 of how likely you are to win or lose against different people.

42:13.240 --> 42:16.680
 Yeah, and my rating is obviously carried

42:16.680 --> 42:19.700
 through thousands of games.

42:20.720 --> 42:25.720
 Right now, my rating is 2861, which is decent.

42:26.080 --> 42:28.920
 I think that pretty much corresponds

42:28.920 --> 42:32.680
 to the level I have at the moment,

42:32.680 --> 42:36.320
 which means in order to reach 2900,

42:36.320 --> 42:40.040
 I would have to either get better at chess,

42:40.040 --> 42:45.040
 which I think is fairly hard to do,

42:45.520 --> 42:47.200
 at least considerably better.

42:47.200 --> 42:51.440
 So what I would need to do is try and optimize

42:51.440 --> 42:56.440
 even more in terms of preparations, everything.

42:56.440 --> 42:59.680
 Not necessarily like selecting tournaments and so on,

42:59.680 --> 43:04.640
 but just optimizing in terms of preparation,

43:04.640 --> 43:08.960
 making sure I never have any bad days.

43:08.960 --> 43:10.600
 So you basically can't lose.

43:10.600 --> 43:13.440
 Yeah, I basically can't fuck up ever

43:13.440 --> 43:17.560
 if I wanna reach that goal.

43:17.560 --> 43:22.560
 And so I think reaching 2900 is pretty unlikely.

43:22.800 --> 43:26.360
 The reason I've set the goal is to have something

43:26.360 --> 43:31.120
 to play for, to have a motivation

43:31.120 --> 43:36.000
 to actually try and be at my best when I play.

43:36.000 --> 43:40.560
 Because otherwise, I'm playing to some extent,

43:40.560 --> 43:45.480
 mostly for fun these days in that I love to play,

43:45.480 --> 43:50.480
 I love to try and win, but I don't have a lot to prove

43:51.520 --> 43:55.080
 or anything, but that gives me at least the motivation

43:55.080 --> 43:59.000
 to try and be at my best all the time,

43:59.000 --> 44:02.240
 which I think is something to aim for.

44:02.240 --> 44:05.760
 So at the moment, I'm quite enjoying that process

44:05.760 --> 44:10.760
 of trying to, yeah, trying to optimize.

44:12.080 --> 44:15.600
 What would you say motivates you in this now

44:15.600 --> 44:17.960
 and in the years leading up to now?

44:17.960 --> 44:21.100
 The love of winning or the fear of losing?

44:22.880 --> 44:25.880
 So for the World Championship,

44:25.880 --> 44:29.360
 it's been fear of losing for sure.

44:29.360 --> 44:34.360
 Other tournaments, love of winning is a great, great factor

44:34.360 --> 44:36.800
 and that's why I also get more joy

44:36.800 --> 44:39.320
 from winning most tournaments than I do

44:39.320 --> 44:41.200
 for winning the World Championship

44:41.200 --> 44:44.560
 because then it's mostly been a relief.

44:44.560 --> 44:48.520
 I also think I enjoy winning more now than I did before

44:48.520 --> 44:52.800
 because I feel like I'm a little bit more relaxed now.

44:52.800 --> 44:57.080
 And I also know that it's not gonna last forever.

44:57.080 --> 45:02.080
 So every little win, I appreciate a lot more now.

45:02.080 --> 45:05.680
 And yeah, in terms of fear of losing,

45:05.680 --> 45:08.720
 that's a huge reason why I'm not gonna play

45:08.720 --> 45:09.640
 the World Championship

45:09.640 --> 45:14.640
 because it really didn't give me a lot of joy.

45:14.640 --> 45:17.320
 It really was all about avoiding losing.

45:17.320 --> 45:19.320
 Why is it that the World Championship

45:19.320 --> 45:22.280
 really makes you feel this way, the anxiety?

45:22.280 --> 45:26.240
 So when you say losing, do you mean not just the match

45:26.240 --> 45:31.240
 but every single position, like the fear of a blunder?

45:31.240 --> 45:32.960
 No, I mean, the blunder is okay.

45:32.960 --> 45:34.960
 Like when I sit down at the board,

45:34.960 --> 45:38.560
 then it's mostly been fine because then I'm focused on.

45:38.560 --> 45:39.400
 Got it.

45:39.400 --> 45:40.560
 Then I'm focused on the game

45:40.560 --> 45:42.520
 and then I know that I can play the game.

45:42.520 --> 45:45.680
 It's a time like in between, like knowing that,

45:45.680 --> 45:49.120
 you know, I feel like losing is not an option

45:49.120 --> 45:50.640
 because it's the World Championship

45:50.640 --> 45:53.320
 and because in a World Championship, there are two players.

45:53.320 --> 45:56.120
 There's a winner and a loser.

45:56.120 --> 45:59.760
 If I don't win a random tournament that I play,

45:59.760 --> 46:03.680
 then, you know, I'm usually, it depends on the tournament.

46:03.680 --> 46:06.320
 I might be disappointed for sure.

46:06.320 --> 46:07.760
 Might even be pretty pissed,

46:07.760 --> 46:11.920
 but ultimately, you know, you go on to the next one.

46:11.920 --> 46:12.800
 With the World Championship,

46:12.800 --> 46:14.920
 you don't go on to the next one.

46:14.920 --> 46:17.400
 It's like, it's years.

46:17.400 --> 46:18.240
 Yeah.

46:18.240 --> 46:20.880
 And it also has been like,

46:20.880 --> 46:24.280
 it's been a core part of my identity for a while now

46:24.280 --> 46:26.440
 that I am World Champion.

46:26.440 --> 46:31.440
 And so there's not an option of losing that.

46:31.640 --> 46:32.480
 Yeah.

46:32.480 --> 46:34.360
 Yeah, there's, you're gonna have to,

46:34.360 --> 46:36.000
 at least for a couple of years,

46:36.000 --> 46:39.440
 carry the weight of having lost.

46:39.440 --> 46:42.360
 You're the former World Champion now,

46:42.360 --> 46:46.040
 if you lose versus the current World Champion.

46:46.040 --> 46:51.040
 There are certain sports that create that anxiety

46:51.080 --> 46:52.360
 and others that don't.

46:52.360 --> 46:55.640
 For example, I think UFC, like mixed martial arts

46:55.640 --> 46:57.560
 are a little better with losing.

46:57.560 --> 47:00.360
 It's understood, like everybody loses.

47:00.360 --> 47:01.200
 But then.

47:01.200 --> 47:02.040
 Not everybody though.

47:02.040 --> 47:02.880
 Not everybody.

47:02.880 --> 47:03.720
 Not everybody.

47:03.720 --> 47:04.560
 Not everybody.

47:04.560 --> 47:05.680
 Yes.

47:05.680 --> 47:07.040
 Khabib entered the chat.

47:08.880 --> 47:11.400
 But in boxing, there is like that extra pressure

47:11.400 --> 47:13.520
 of like maintaining the championship.

47:13.520 --> 47:14.920
 I mean, maybe you could say the same thing

47:14.920 --> 47:17.200
 about the UFC as well.

47:17.200 --> 47:22.040
 So for you personally, for a person who loves chess,

47:22.040 --> 47:23.760
 the first time you won the World Championship,

47:23.760 --> 47:28.160
 that was the big, that was the thing that was fun.

47:28.160 --> 47:29.000
 Yeah.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.160
 And then everything after is like stressful.

47:32.160 --> 47:33.760
 Yeah.

47:33.760 --> 47:34.800
 Essentially.

47:34.800 --> 47:38.320
 There was certainly stress involved the first time as well.

47:39.480 --> 47:44.480
 But it was nothing compared to the others.

47:44.760 --> 47:46.920
 So the only World Championship after that

47:46.920 --> 47:49.640
 that I really enjoyed was the one in 2018

47:49.640 --> 47:51.800
 against the American Fabiano Caruana.

47:51.800 --> 47:53.600
 And what that made that different

47:53.600 --> 47:57.160
 is that I'd been kind of slumping for a bit

47:57.160 --> 47:58.760
 and he'd been on the rise.

47:58.760 --> 48:01.720
 So our ratings were very, very similar.

48:01.720 --> 48:06.560
 They were so close that if at any point during the match

48:06.560 --> 48:07.680
 I'd lost the game,

48:09.920 --> 48:12.400
 he would have been ranked as number one in the world.

48:12.400 --> 48:15.120
 Like our ratings were so close that for each draw,

48:15.120 --> 48:16.680
 they didn't move.

48:16.680 --> 48:17.520
 And.

48:17.520 --> 48:18.800
 And the game itself was close.

48:18.800 --> 48:21.720
 Yeah, the games themselves were very close.

48:21.720 --> 48:26.600
 I had a winning position in the first game

48:26.600 --> 48:28.880
 that I couldn't really get anywhere for a lot of games.

48:28.880 --> 48:31.200
 Then he had a couple of games

48:31.200 --> 48:34.080
 where he could potentially have won.

48:34.080 --> 48:37.040
 Then in the last game I was a little bit better.

48:37.040 --> 48:40.520
 And eventually they were all drawn.

48:40.520 --> 48:41.960
 But I felt like all the way

48:41.960 --> 48:45.000
 that this is an interesting match against an opponent

48:45.000 --> 48:49.720
 who is at this position at this point equal to me.

48:49.720 --> 48:53.640
 And so losing that would not have been this disaster.

48:53.640 --> 48:55.440
 Because in all the other matches,

48:55.440 --> 48:59.240
 I would know that I would have lost against somebody

48:59.240 --> 49:02.280
 who I know I'm much better than.

49:02.280 --> 49:07.280
 And that would be a lot harder for me to take.

49:07.400 --> 49:09.040
 Well, that's fascinating and beautiful

49:09.040 --> 49:11.320
 that the stress isn't from losing.

49:12.440 --> 49:14.440
 Because you have fun.

49:14.440 --> 49:17.280
 You enjoy playing against somebody who's as good as you,

49:17.280 --> 49:18.760
 maybe better than you.

49:18.760 --> 49:20.200
 That's exciting to you.

49:20.200 --> 49:21.040
 Yeah.

49:21.040 --> 49:24.400
 It's losing at this high stakes thing

49:24.400 --> 49:27.400
 that only happens rarely to a person

49:27.400 --> 49:28.640
 who's not as good as you.

49:28.640 --> 49:31.760
 Yeah, and that's why it's also been incredibly frustrating

49:31.760 --> 49:34.480
 in other matches, like when I know,

49:34.480 --> 49:36.840
 when we play draw after draw.

49:36.840 --> 49:39.560
 And I can just, I know that I'm better.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.520
 I can sense during the game

49:41.520 --> 49:43.320
 that I understand it better than them.

49:43.320 --> 49:46.200
 But I cannot get over the hump.

49:46.200 --> 49:51.120
 So you are the best chess player in the world.

49:51.120 --> 49:53.600
 And you not playing the World Championship

49:53.600 --> 49:58.120
 really makes the World Championship not seem important.

49:58.120 --> 50:01.400
 Or I mean, there's an argument to be made for that.

50:01.400 --> 50:03.720
 Is there anything you would like to see

50:03.720 --> 50:05.480
 if you had a change about the World Championship

50:05.480 --> 50:07.080
 that would make it more fun for you?

50:07.080 --> 50:09.200
 And better for the game of chess period

50:09.200 --> 50:10.640
 for everybody involved?

50:10.640 --> 50:14.400
 So I think 12 games or now 14 games

50:14.400 --> 50:16.120
 that there is for the World Championship

50:16.120 --> 50:20.160
 is a fairly, fairly low sample size.

50:20.160 --> 50:23.120
 If you want to determine who the best player is,

50:23.120 --> 50:26.480
 or at least the best player in that particular matchup,

50:26.480 --> 50:27.760
 you need more games.

50:27.760 --> 50:30.040
 And I think to some extent,

50:31.800 --> 50:34.080
 if you're gonna have a World Champion

50:34.080 --> 50:36.000
 and call them the best players,

50:36.000 --> 50:37.280
 best player, you gotta make sure

50:37.280 --> 50:39.720
 that the format increases the chance

50:39.720 --> 50:41.920
 of finding the best player.

50:41.920 --> 50:43.960
 So I think having more games,

50:43.960 --> 50:45.880
 and if you're gonna have a lot more games,

50:45.880 --> 50:50.240
 then you need to decrease the time control a bit,

50:50.240 --> 50:54.120
 which in turn, I think is also a good thing

50:54.120 --> 50:59.120
 because in very long time controls with deep preparation,

50:59.840 --> 51:03.000
 you can sort of mask a lot of your deficiencies

51:03.000 --> 51:05.640
 as a chess player

51:07.000 --> 51:10.680
 because you have a lot of time to think and to defend.

51:10.680 --> 51:14.440
 And also, yeah, you have deep preparation.

51:14.440 --> 51:17.960
 So I think those would be, for me to play,

51:17.960 --> 51:22.000
 those would be the main things,

51:22.000 --> 51:24.760
 more games and less time.

51:24.760 --> 51:26.720
 So you want to see more games

51:26.720 --> 51:30.200
 and rules that emphasize pure chess?

51:30.200 --> 51:35.200
 Yeah, but already less time emphasizes pure chess

51:35.680 --> 51:40.480
 because defensive techniques are much harder

51:40.480 --> 51:42.360
 to execute with a little time.

51:42.360 --> 51:45.040
 What do you think, is there a sweet spot in terms of,

51:45.040 --> 51:46.240
 are we talking about Blitz?

51:46.240 --> 51:47.080
 Is it, how many minutes?

51:47.080 --> 51:48.600
 I think Blitz is a bit too fast.

51:49.560 --> 51:53.960
 To their credit, this was suggested by Fieda as well.

51:53.960 --> 51:57.240
 For a start to have two games per day,

51:57.240 --> 52:01.240
 and let's say you have 45 minutes a game

52:01.240 --> 52:04.320
 plus 15 or 30 seconds per move,

52:04.320 --> 52:07.440
 that means that each sessions will probably be about,

52:07.440 --> 52:10.120
 or a little less than two hours.

52:10.120 --> 52:11.880
 That would be a start.

52:11.880 --> 52:14.880
 Also what we're playing in the tournament

52:14.880 --> 52:17.520
 that I'm playing here in Miami,

52:17.520 --> 52:20.400
 which is four games a day

52:20.400 --> 52:24.360
 with 15 minutes plus 10 seconds per move,

52:24.360 --> 52:27.280
 those four would be more interesting

52:27.280 --> 52:29.720
 than the one there is now.

52:29.720 --> 52:32.720
 And I understand that there are a lot of traditions.

52:32.720 --> 52:35.040
 People don't want to change the World Championship.

52:35.040 --> 52:36.240
 That's all fine.

52:36.240 --> 52:40.320
 I just think that the World Championship

52:40.320 --> 52:42.760
 should do a better job of trying to reflect

52:42.760 --> 52:44.920
 who's the best overall chess player.

52:46.280 --> 52:50.200
 So would you say like, if it's faster games,

52:50.200 --> 52:52.040
 you'd probably be able to get a sample size

52:52.040 --> 52:55.320
 of like over 20 games, 20, 30, 40.

52:55.320 --> 52:56.800
 You think there's a number that's good

52:56.800 --> 52:58.400
 over a long period of time?

52:58.400 --> 53:00.280
 Well, I would prefer as many as possible.

53:00.280 --> 53:01.200
 So like a hundred?

53:02.520 --> 53:07.400
 Yeah, but let's say you play 12 days, two games a day.

53:07.400 --> 53:09.120
 You know, that's 24.

53:09.120 --> 53:11.480
 I feel like that's already quite a bit better.

53:11.480 --> 53:15.920
 You play like one black game, one white game each day.

53:15.920 --> 53:17.360
 Endurance wise, that's okay?

53:17.360 --> 53:18.240
 Yeah, I think that's fine.

53:18.240 --> 53:19.680
 Like you will have free days as well.

53:19.680 --> 53:22.320
 So I don't think that will be a problem.

53:23.480 --> 53:26.320
 And also you have to prepare two sets of openings

53:26.320 --> 53:29.120
 for each day, which makes it more difficult

53:29.120 --> 53:32.560
 for the teams preparing, which I think is also good.

53:32.560 --> 53:34.480
 Let me ask you a fun question.

53:34.480 --> 53:39.480
 If Hikaru Nakamura was one of the two people,

53:39.840 --> 53:41.480
 I guess, I apologize.

53:41.480 --> 53:43.760
 Yeah, he could have finished second.

53:43.760 --> 53:45.760
 So he lost the last round of the candidates.

53:45.760 --> 53:48.440
 Yeah, and maybe you can explain to me,

53:48.440 --> 53:51.920
 internet speed copium is something you tweeted.

53:51.920 --> 53:53.000
 Yeah.

53:53.000 --> 53:58.000
 But if he got second, would you just despite him

53:59.040 --> 54:01.200
 still play the world championship?

54:01.200 --> 54:02.680
 That's internet question.

54:02.680 --> 54:04.960
 And when the internet asks, I must abide.

54:04.960 --> 54:06.440
 The dude abides.

54:06.440 --> 54:07.600
 Yeah, sure.

54:07.600 --> 54:08.600
 Thank you, internet.

54:10.920 --> 54:15.040
 So after the last match, I did an interview

54:17.160 --> 54:20.120
 right after where I talked about the fact

54:20.120 --> 54:22.360
 that I was unlikely to play the next one.

54:22.360 --> 54:26.680
 I'd spoken privately to both family, friends,

54:26.680 --> 54:29.080
 and of course also my chess team

54:29.080 --> 54:33.840
 that this was likely going to be the last match.

54:34.960 --> 54:38.160
 What happened was that right before

54:38.160 --> 54:39.320
 the world championship match,

54:39.320 --> 54:42.240
 there was this young player, Alireza Firouzsa.

54:42.240 --> 54:43.560
 He had a dramatic rise.

54:43.560 --> 54:46.120
 He rose to second in the world rankings.

54:46.120 --> 54:48.920
 He was 18 then, he's 19 now.

54:48.920 --> 54:50.920
 He qualified for the candidates.

54:50.920 --> 54:53.040
 And it felt like there was like at least

54:53.040 --> 54:59.360
 a half realistic possibility that he could be the challenger

54:59.360 --> 55:01.520
 for the next world championship.

55:01.520 --> 55:04.520
 And that sort of lit a fire under me.

55:04.520 --> 55:05.360
 Do you like that idea?

55:05.360 --> 55:07.440
 Yeah, I like that a lot.

55:07.440 --> 55:11.800
 I love the idea of playing him in the next world championship.

55:11.800 --> 55:16.640
 And originally, I was sure that I wanted to announce

55:16.640 --> 55:19.080
 right after the tournament, the match,

55:19.080 --> 55:20.720
 that this was it, I'm done.

55:20.720 --> 55:22.600
 I'm not playing the next one.

55:22.600 --> 55:24.120
 But this lit a fire under me.

55:24.120 --> 55:29.720
 So that made me think, this actually motivates me.

55:29.720 --> 55:33.120
 And I just wanted to get it out there for several reasons

55:33.120 --> 55:36.680
 to create more hype about the candidates,

55:36.680 --> 55:40.240
 to sort of motivate myself a little bit,

55:40.240 --> 55:42.320
 maybe motivate him.

55:42.320 --> 55:45.840
 Also, obviously I wanted to give people a heads up

55:45.840 --> 55:49.600
 for the candidates that you might be playing

55:49.600 --> 55:53.360
 for more than first place.

55:53.360 --> 55:56.280
 Normally, the candidates is first place or best.

55:56.280 --> 55:59.160
 It's like the world championship.

55:59.160 --> 56:02.360
 And then, so Nakamura was one of many people

56:02.360 --> 56:05.520
 who just didn't believe me, which is fair.

56:05.520 --> 56:10.120
 Because I've talked before about not necessarily wanting

56:10.120 --> 56:11.960
 to defend again.

56:11.960 --> 56:16.880
 But I never talked as concretely or was as serious as this time.

56:16.880 --> 56:19.000
 So he simply didn't believe me.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.200
 And he was very vocal about that.

56:21.200 --> 56:24.400
 And he said, nobody believed me, no other players,

56:24.400 --> 56:27.120
 which may or may not have been true.

56:27.120 --> 56:29.240
 And then, yeah, he lost the last game.

56:29.240 --> 56:31.720
 And he didn't qualify.

56:31.720 --> 56:35.520
 But to answer the question, no, I'd already at that point

56:35.520 --> 56:38.160
 decided that I wouldn't play.

56:38.160 --> 56:44.400
 I would have liked it less if he had not lost the last round.

56:44.400 --> 56:48.680
 But the decision was already made.

56:48.680 --> 56:51.200
 Does it break your heart a little bit

56:51.200 --> 56:54.440
 that you're walking away from it?

56:54.440 --> 56:55.920
 In all the ways that you mentioned

56:55.920 --> 56:59.000
 that it's just not fun, there's a bunch of ways

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
 that it doesn't seem to bring out the best kind of chess.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.920
 It doesn't bring out the best out of you

57:03.920 --> 57:05.720
 in the particular opponents involved.

57:05.720 --> 57:07.440
 Does it just break your heart a little bit?

57:07.440 --> 57:10.880
 Like you're walking away from something,

57:10.880 --> 57:12.440
 or maybe the entire chess community

57:12.440 --> 57:17.320
 is walking away from a kind of a historic event that

57:17.320 --> 57:20.960
 was so important in the 20th century at least?

57:20.960 --> 57:23.840
 So I won the championship in 2013.

57:23.840 --> 57:28.520
 I said no to the candidates in 2011.

57:28.520 --> 57:30.720
 I didn't particularly like the format.

57:30.720 --> 57:34.040
 I also wasn't, I was just not in the mood.

57:34.040 --> 57:39.520
 I didn't want the pressure that was connected with the World

57:39.520 --> 57:40.120
 Championship.

57:40.120 --> 57:42.960
 And I was perfectly content at the time

57:42.960 --> 57:46.320
 to play the tournaments that I did play,

57:46.320 --> 57:48.840
 also to be ranked number one in the world.

57:48.840 --> 57:52.880
 I was comfortable with the fact that I knew that I was the best

57:52.880 --> 57:56.960
 and I didn't need a title to show others.

57:56.960 --> 58:02.080
 And what happened later is I suddenly decided to play.

58:02.080 --> 58:05.240
 In 2013, they changed the format.

58:05.240 --> 58:08.280
 I liked it better.

58:08.280 --> 58:11.080
 I just decided, it could be interesting.

58:11.080 --> 58:13.680
 Let's try and get this.

58:13.680 --> 58:17.280
 There really wasn't more than that to it.

58:17.280 --> 58:21.840
 It wasn't like fulfilling lifelong dream or anything.

58:21.840 --> 58:25.160
 I just thought, let's play.

58:25.160 --> 58:27.160
 So it's just a cool tournament, a good challenge.

58:27.160 --> 58:30.400
 Yeah, it's a cool tournament, it's a good challenge.

58:30.400 --> 58:31.160
 Why not?

58:31.160 --> 58:35.040
 It's something that could be a motivation.

58:35.040 --> 58:39.120
 It motivated me to get in the best shape of my life

58:39.120 --> 58:40.520
 that I had been until then.

58:40.520 --> 58:42.280
 So it was a good thing.

58:42.280 --> 58:46.640
 And 2013 match brought me a lot of joy as well.

58:46.640 --> 58:49.400
 So I'm very, very happy that I did that.

58:49.400 --> 58:50.960
 But I never had any thoughts that I'm

58:50.960 --> 58:54.280
 going to keep the title for a long time.

58:54.280 --> 58:58.800
 Immediately after the match in 2013,

58:58.800 --> 59:01.920
 also before the match, I'd spoken against the fact

59:01.920 --> 59:04.440
 that the champion is seeded into the final, which

59:04.440 --> 59:07.320
 I thought was unfair.

59:07.320 --> 59:10.600
 After the match, I made a proposal

59:10.600 --> 59:13.800
 that we have a different system where the champion doesn't

59:13.800 --> 59:14.880
 have these privileges.

59:14.880 --> 59:19.080
 And people's reaction, both players and chess community,

59:19.080 --> 59:22.120
 was generally like, OK, we're good.

59:22.120 --> 59:23.960
 We don't want that.

59:23.960 --> 59:26.080
 You keep your privileges.

59:26.080 --> 59:27.920
 And I was like, OK, whatever.

59:27.920 --> 59:30.080
 So you want to fight for it every time?

59:30.080 --> 59:34.480
 Yeah, I want that.

59:34.480 --> 59:37.360
 I have to ask, just in case you have an opinion,

59:37.360 --> 59:41.000
 if you can maybe from a fantasy chess perspective

59:41.000 --> 59:45.520
 analyze Ding versus Nepo, who wins?

59:45.520 --> 59:48.080
 The current, the two people that would

59:48.080 --> 59:50.520
 play if you're not playing.

59:50.520 --> 59:54.600
 Generally, I would consider that Ding has a slightly better

59:54.600 --> 59:57.160
 overall chess strength.

59:57.160 --> 59:59.360
 What are the strengths and weaknesses of each,

59:59.360 --> 1:00:02.440
 if you can summarize it?

1:00:02.440 --> 1:00:08.720
 So Nepo, he's even better at calculating short lines

1:00:08.720 --> 1:00:11.080
 than I am.

1:00:11.080 --> 1:00:16.520
 But he can sometimes lack a little bit of depth.

1:00:16.520 --> 1:00:19.920
 In short lines, he's an absolute calculation monster.

1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:22.880
 He's extremely quick.

1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:25.080
 But he can sometimes lack a bit of depth.

1:00:25.080 --> 1:00:28.800
 Also recently, he's improved his openings quite a bit.

1:00:28.800 --> 1:00:33.520
 So now he has a lot of good ideas.

1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:36.880
 And he's very, very solid.

1:00:36.880 --> 1:00:39.720
 Ding is not quite as well prepared.

1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:42.560
 But he has an excellent understanding

1:00:42.560 --> 1:00:48.920
 of dynamics and imbalances in chess, I would say.

1:00:48.920 --> 1:00:51.440
 What do you mean by imbalances?

1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:54.360
 Imbalances like bishops against knights

1:00:54.360 --> 1:00:55.800
 and material imbalances.

1:00:55.800 --> 1:00:57.600
 He can take advantage of those.

1:00:57.600 --> 1:01:00.440
 Yes, I would say he's very, very good at that

1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:04.360
 and understanding the dynamic factors,

1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:10.440
 as we call them, like material versus time, especially.

1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:12.920
 I think Nepo got the better of him and the candidates.

1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:14.800
 So what's your sense why Ding has

1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:17.080
 an edge in the championship?

1:01:17.080 --> 1:01:21.320
 I feel like individual past results hasn't necessarily

1:01:21.320 --> 1:01:25.960
 been a great indicator of world championship results.

1:01:25.960 --> 1:01:32.000
 I feel like overall chess strength is more important.

1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.840
 To be fair, I only think Ding has a very small edge.

1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:36.680
 Difference is not big at all.

1:01:36.680 --> 1:01:39.960
 But our individual head to head record

1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:42.720
 was probably the main reason that a lot of people

1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:45.680
 thought Nepo had a good chance against me as well.

1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:51.560
 It was like 4 to 1 in his favor before the match.

1:01:51.560 --> 1:01:53.320
 But that was just another example

1:01:53.320 --> 1:01:56.640
 of why that may not necessarily mean anything.

1:01:56.640 --> 1:02:00.360
 Also in our case, it was a very, very low sample size,

1:02:00.360 --> 1:02:05.600
 I think, about the size of the match in total, 14 games.

1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:09.200
 And that generally doesn't mean much.

1:02:09.200 --> 1:02:11.920
 How close were those games, would you say, in your mind

1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:14.040
 for the previous championship?

1:02:14.040 --> 1:02:18.440
 So that game six was a turning point where you won.

1:02:18.440 --> 1:02:21.480
 Was there any doubt in your mind that if you

1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:24.000
 do a much larger sample size that you'll

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:25.360
 get the better of Nepo?

1:02:25.360 --> 1:02:28.520
 No, no, larger sample size is always good for me.

1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:33.600
 So world championship, it's a great parallel to football

1:02:33.600 --> 1:02:36.440
 because it's a low scoring game.

1:02:36.440 --> 1:02:41.320
 And if the better player or the better team scores,

1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:44.160
 they win most of the time.

1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:47.280
 Oh, that's generally for championships or in general?

1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:48.960
 Yeah, for championships.

1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:54.040
 They generally, generally win because the other slightly

1:02:54.040 --> 1:02:57.120
 weaker team, they're good enough to defend

1:02:57.120 --> 1:03:00.000
 to make it very, very difficult for the others.

1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.760
 But when they actually have to create the chances,

1:03:02.760 --> 1:03:04.040
 then they have no chance.

1:03:04.040 --> 1:03:06.640
 And then it very often ends with a blowout

1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:08.920
 as it did in our match.

1:03:08.920 --> 1:03:11.280
 If I hadn't won game six, it probably

1:03:11.280 --> 1:03:13.160
 would have been very, very close.

1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:14.760
 He might have edged it.

1:03:14.760 --> 1:03:16.200
 There's obviously a bigger chance

1:03:16.200 --> 1:03:18.280
 that I would have edged it.

1:03:18.280 --> 1:03:21.240
 But this is just what happens a lot in chess,

1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:24.080
 but also in football that matches are close

1:03:24.080 --> 1:03:27.800
 and then they somebody scores, somebody scores

1:03:27.800 --> 1:03:30.000
 and then things change.

1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:32.640
 And this gives people the illusion

1:03:32.640 --> 1:03:35.960
 that the matchup was very close.

1:03:35.960 --> 1:03:40.240
 Well, actually, it just means that the nature of the game

1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:43.760
 makes the matches close very often.

1:03:43.760 --> 1:03:47.560
 But it's always much more likely that one of the teams

1:03:47.560 --> 1:03:49.120
 is going to or one of the players

1:03:49.120 --> 1:03:51.480
 is going to break away than the others.

1:03:51.480 --> 1:03:56.080
 And in other matches as well, even though a lot of people

1:03:56.080 --> 1:04:01.440
 before the match in 2016 against Karjakin,

1:04:01.440 --> 1:04:04.320
 there were people who thought before the match

1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:07.600
 that I was massively overrated as a favorite

1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:12.920
 and that essentially the match was pretty, pretty close,

1:04:12.920 --> 1:04:18.920
 like whatever, 60, 40, or some people even said like 55, 45.

1:04:18.920 --> 1:04:23.120
 And what I felt was that the match went very, very wrong

1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:25.880
 for me and I still won.

1:04:25.880 --> 1:04:28.200
 And some people saw that as an indication

1:04:28.200 --> 1:04:30.240
 that the pre match probabilities were probably

1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:31.640
 a bit closer than people thought.

1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:35.760
 Well, I would look at it in the way that everything went wrong

1:04:35.760 --> 1:04:38.600
 and I still won, which probably means

1:04:38.600 --> 1:04:41.000
 that I was a pretty big favorite to begin with.

1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.800
 I do have a question to you about that match, but first,

1:04:43.800 --> 1:04:46.880
 so Sergei Karjakin was originally a qualifier

1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:50.160
 for the candidate tournament, but was disqualified

1:04:50.160 --> 1:04:52.400
 for breaching the FIDE code of ethics

1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:54.120
 after publicly expressing approval

1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:57.880
 for the 2022 Russian invasion in Ukraine.

1:04:57.880 --> 1:05:00.400
 You look at the Cold War and some of the US

1:05:00.400 --> 1:05:02.480
 versus Russian games of the past,

1:05:02.480 --> 1:05:05.880
 does politics, does some of this geopolitics,

1:05:05.880 --> 1:05:09.360
 politics ever creep its way into the game?

1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:11.520
 Do you feel the pressure, the immensity of that

1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:13.600
 as it does sometimes for the Olympics,

1:05:13.600 --> 1:05:15.640
 these big nations playing each other,

1:05:15.640 --> 1:05:17.120
 competing against each other,

1:05:17.120 --> 1:05:22.120
 almost like fighting out in a friendly way,

1:05:22.200 --> 1:05:23.880
 the battles, the tensions that they have

1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:26.080
 in the space of geopolitics?

1:05:26.080 --> 1:05:27.640
 Yeah, I think it still does.

1:05:27.640 --> 1:05:30.920
 So the president of the World Chess Federation

1:05:30.920 --> 1:05:33.920
 who was just reelected is a Russian.

1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:36.840
 Like I like him personally, for sure,

1:05:36.840 --> 1:05:39.640
 but he is quite connected to the Kremlin.

1:05:39.640 --> 1:05:42.920
 And it's quite clear that the Kremlin

1:05:42.920 --> 1:05:45.640
 considers it at least a semi important goal

1:05:45.640 --> 1:05:49.360
 to bring the chess crown home to Russia.

1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:52.960
 So it's still definitely a factor.

1:05:52.960 --> 1:05:56.720
 And I mean, I can answer for in the Karjakin case,

1:05:56.720 --> 1:06:00.120
 like I don't have a strong opinion

1:06:00.120 --> 1:06:03.920
 on whether he should have been banned or not.

1:06:03.920 --> 1:06:05.800
 Obviously, I don't agree with anything

1:06:05.800 --> 1:06:08.480
 that he says.

1:06:08.480 --> 1:06:13.480
 But in principle, I think that you should ban

1:06:14.400 --> 1:06:17.000
 either no Russians or all Russians.

1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:22.000
 I'm generally not particularly against either,

1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:27.480
 but I don't love banning wrong opinions,

1:06:27.480 --> 1:06:32.480
 even if they are as reprehensible as his have been.

1:06:32.480 --> 1:06:36.440
 Yeah, there's something about the World Chess Championships

1:06:36.440 --> 1:06:39.440
 or the Olympics where it feels like banning

1:06:39.440 --> 1:06:41.520
 is counterproductive to the alleviating

1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:43.040
 some of the conflicts.

1:06:43.040 --> 1:06:43.880
 We don't know.

1:06:43.880 --> 1:06:45.200
 This is the thing though.

1:06:45.200 --> 1:06:48.920
 We really don't know about the long term conflicts.

1:06:48.920 --> 1:06:53.280
 And a lot of people try to do the right thing in this sense,

1:06:53.280 --> 1:06:54.800
 which I don't really blame at all.

1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:57.760
 It's just that we don't know.

1:06:57.760 --> 1:07:00.880
 And I guess sometimes there are other ways

1:07:00.880 --> 1:07:04.120
 you wanna try and help as well.

1:07:04.120 --> 1:07:05.920
 See, like within the competition,

1:07:05.920 --> 1:07:08.440
 within some of those battles of US versus Russia

1:07:08.440 --> 1:07:10.120
 or so on of the past,

1:07:10.120 --> 1:07:12.760
 there's also between the individuals,

1:07:14.160 --> 1:07:15.360
 maybe you'll disagree with this,

1:07:15.360 --> 1:07:16.920
 but from a spectator perspective,

1:07:16.920 --> 1:07:18.840
 there's still a camaraderie.

1:07:18.840 --> 1:07:20.800
 Like at the end of the day,

1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:22.360
 there's a thing that unites you,

1:07:22.360 --> 1:07:25.320
 which is this like appreciation

1:07:25.320 --> 1:07:27.320
 of the fight over the chessboard.

1:07:29.280 --> 1:07:30.520
 Even if you hate each other.

1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:31.560
 Yeah, for sure.

1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:35.840
 I think for every match that's been,

1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:37.680
 you would briefly discuss the game

1:07:37.680 --> 1:07:40.200
 with your opponent after the game,

1:07:40.200 --> 1:07:41.800
 no matter how much you hate each other.

1:07:41.800 --> 1:07:43.960
 And I think that's lovely.

1:07:43.960 --> 1:07:46.800
 And Kasparov, I mean, he was quoted,

1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:48.880
 like when somebody in his team asked him like,

1:07:48.880 --> 1:07:52.280
 why are you talking to Karpov after the game?

1:07:52.280 --> 1:07:54.320
 Like you hate that guy.

1:07:54.320 --> 1:07:55.280
 And he's like, yeah, sure.

1:07:55.280 --> 1:07:57.560
 But he's the only one who understands me.

1:07:57.560 --> 1:07:59.280
 Yeah, the only one who understands.

1:07:59.280 --> 1:08:01.680
 So that's, no, I think that's really lovely.

1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:06.280
 And I would love to see that in other areas as well,

1:08:06.280 --> 1:08:09.320
 that you can, regardless of what happens,

1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:12.120
 you can have a good chat about the game.

1:08:12.120 --> 1:08:15.080
 You can just talk about the ideas

1:08:15.080 --> 1:08:18.800
 with people who understand what you understand.

1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:21.760
 So if you're not playing the world championships,

1:08:21.760 --> 1:08:24.400
 there's a lot of people who are saying

1:08:24.400 --> 1:08:27.720
 that perhaps the world championships don't matter anymore.

1:08:27.720 --> 1:08:30.160
 Do you think there's some truth to that?

1:08:30.160 --> 1:08:32.560
 I said that back a long time ago as well,

1:08:32.560 --> 1:08:37.560
 that for me, I don't know if it never happened.

1:08:37.840 --> 1:08:39.400
 So I don't know what would have happened,

1:08:39.400 --> 1:08:43.000
 but I was thinking like the moment that I realized

1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:44.480
 that I'm not the best player in the world,

1:08:44.480 --> 1:08:47.440
 like I felt like morally I have to renounce

1:08:47.440 --> 1:08:49.680
 the world championship title, you know,

1:08:49.680 --> 1:08:51.440
 because it doesn't mean anything

1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:53.560
 as long as you're not the best player.

1:08:53.560 --> 1:08:58.560
 So the ratings really tell a bigger, a clearer story.

1:08:58.920 --> 1:09:01.360
 I think so, at least over time.

1:09:01.360 --> 1:09:05.080
 Like I'm a lot more proud of my streak

1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:06.800
 of being rated number one in the world,

1:09:06.800 --> 1:09:11.800
 which is now since I think the summer of 2011.

1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:17.720
 I'm a lot more proud of that than the world championships.

1:09:17.720 --> 1:09:21.520
 How much anxiety or even fear do you have

1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:24.440
 before making a difficult decision on the chessboard?

1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:26.680
 So it's a high stakes game.

1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:28.840
 How nervous do you get?

1:09:28.840 --> 1:09:31.000
 How much anxiety do you have in all that calculations?

1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.640
 You're sitting there for 10, 15 minutes

1:09:33.640 --> 1:09:35.080
 because you're in a fog.

1:09:35.080 --> 1:09:38.080
 There's always a possibility of a blunder, of a mistake.

1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:39.320
 Are you anxious about it?

1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:40.880
 Are you afraid of it?

1:09:40.880 --> 1:09:41.920
 Really depends.

1:09:42.880 --> 1:09:45.880
 I have been at times.

1:09:45.880 --> 1:09:50.520
 I think the most nervous I ever been was game 10

1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:54.480
 of the world championships in 2018.

1:09:54.480 --> 1:09:58.480
 I know that was just a thrilling game.

1:09:58.480 --> 1:10:00.080
 I was black.

1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:02.840
 I basically abandoned the queen side at some point

1:10:02.840 --> 1:10:04.480
 to attack him on the king side.

1:10:04.480 --> 1:10:08.920
 And I knew that my attack, if it doesn't work,

1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:12.080
 I'm going to lose, but I had so much adrenaline.

1:10:12.080 --> 1:10:13.360
 So that was fine.

1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:14.920
 I thought I was going to win.

1:10:14.920 --> 1:10:18.160
 Then at some point I realized that it's not so clear

1:10:18.160 --> 1:10:20.840
 and that my time was ticking and I was just getting

1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:21.960
 so nervous.

1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:25.360
 I still remember what happened.

1:10:25.360 --> 1:10:28.120
 Like we played this time trouble phase

1:10:28.120 --> 1:10:31.520
 where he had very little time, but I had even less.

1:10:31.520 --> 1:10:35.120
 And I just remember, I kind of remember much of it,

1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:38.400
 just that when it was over, I was just so relieved

1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:40.160
 because then it was clear that the position

1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:43.520
 was probably gonna be routed in a draw.

1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:47.360
 Otherwise I'm often nervous before games,

1:10:47.360 --> 1:10:50.720
 but when I get there, it's all business.

1:10:50.720 --> 1:10:53.760
 And especially when I'm playing well,

1:10:53.760 --> 1:10:57.920
 I'm never afraid of losing when I play

1:10:57.920 --> 1:11:01.120
 because I trust my instincts.

1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:03.480
 I trust my skills.

1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:06.120
 How much psychological intimidation is there

1:11:06.120 --> 1:11:09.840
 from you to the other person, from the other person to you?

1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:11.880
 I think people would play a lot better

1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:15.080
 if they played against an anonymous me.

1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:20.080
 I would love to have a tournament online

1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:25.440
 where let's say you play 10 of the best players in the world

1:11:25.440 --> 1:11:28.680
 and for each round you don't know who you're playing.

1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:31.840
 That's an interesting question.

1:11:31.840 --> 1:11:35.000
 There's these videos where people eat McDonald's

1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:38.560
 or Burger King or Diet Coke versus Diet Pepsi.

1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:41.120
 Would people be able to tell they're playing you

1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:45.040
 from the style of play, do you think?

1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:46.600
 Or from the strength of play?

1:11:48.360 --> 1:11:51.240
 If there was a decent sample size, sure.

1:11:51.240 --> 1:11:52.080
 And what about you?

1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:55.200
 Would you be able to tell others?

1:11:55.200 --> 1:11:58.160
 In just one game?

1:11:58.160 --> 1:11:59.240
 Very unlikely.

1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:02.200
 What sample size would you need to tell accurately?

1:12:02.200 --> 1:12:03.600
 I feel like this is science.

1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:06.720
 Yeah, I think 20 games would help a lot.

1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:07.560
 Per person?

1:12:07.560 --> 1:12:09.120
 Yeah.

1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:13.600
 But I know that they've already developed AI bots

1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:16.960
 that are pretty good at recognizing somebody's style.

1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:17.800
 Okay.

1:12:17.800 --> 1:12:20.280
 Which is quite fascinating.

1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:23.720
 And it'd be fascinating if those bots

1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:26.000
 were able to summarize the style somehow.

1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.440
 Maybe great attacking chess,

1:12:28.440 --> 1:12:29.760
 like some of the same characteristics

1:12:29.760 --> 1:12:33.600
 you've been describing like great at short line calculations

1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:34.440
 all that kind of stuff.

1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:35.760
 Yeah.

1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:37.760
 Or did you just talk shit?

1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:40.600
 No, but really all the best chess players,

1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:42.200
 there are basically just two camps.

1:12:42.200 --> 1:12:46.240
 People who are good at longer lines or shorter lines.

1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:49.280
 It's the hare and the tortoise, basically.

1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:51.800
 And sometimes, you know,

1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:55.040
 I feel like I'm the closest you can get

1:12:55.040 --> 1:12:57.800
 to a high bridge of those.

1:12:58.680 --> 1:13:00.040
 Because you got both,

1:13:00.040 --> 1:13:02.080
 you're good in every position.

1:13:02.080 --> 1:13:03.600
 So the middle game and end game.

1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:06.600
 Yeah, and also I can think to some extent

1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:08.960
 both rapidly and deeply,

1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:11.920
 which a lot of people, they can't do both.

1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:14.320
 But I mean, to answer your question from before,

1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:15.640
 I think, yeah,

1:13:15.640 --> 1:13:18.120
 I sometimes can get a little bit intimidated

1:13:18.120 --> 1:13:18.960
 by my opponent,

1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:23.880
 but it's mostly if there's something unknown.

1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:25.840
 It's mostly if it's something

1:13:25.840 --> 1:13:28.400
 that I don't understand fully.

1:13:28.400 --> 1:13:30.880
 And I do think, especially when I'm playing,

1:13:30.880 --> 1:13:34.640
 well, people, they just play more timidly against me

1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:36.040
 than they do against each other.

1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:39.600
 Sometimes without even realizing it.

1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:42.880
 And I certainly use that to my advantage.

1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:46.360
 If I sense that my opponent is apprehensive,

1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:49.720
 if I sense that they are not gonna necessarily

1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:51.360
 take all their chances,

1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:53.360
 it just means that I can take more risk.

1:13:53.360 --> 1:13:58.360
 And I always try and find that balance.

1:13:58.400 --> 1:13:59.680
 To shake them up a little bit.

1:13:59.680 --> 1:14:00.520
 Yeah.

1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:03.200
 What's been the toughest loss of your career

1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:04.320
 that you remember?

1:14:04.320 --> 1:14:08.200
 Would that be the World Championship match?

1:14:08.200 --> 1:14:09.880
 Oh yeah, for sure.

1:14:09.880 --> 1:14:12.360
 Game eight in 2016.

1:14:12.360 --> 1:14:13.400
 And who was it against?

1:14:13.400 --> 1:14:16.440
 Against Karjakin in New York.

1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:19.320
 Can you take it through the story of that game?

1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:22.280
 Where were you before that game

1:14:22.280 --> 1:14:24.480
 in terms of game one through seven?

1:14:26.160 --> 1:14:29.160
 Yeah, so game one and two, not much happened.

1:14:29.160 --> 1:14:32.720
 Game three and four, I was winning in both of them.

1:14:32.720 --> 1:14:37.720
 And normally, I should definitely have converted both.

1:14:37.720 --> 1:14:42.720
 I couldn't, partly due to good defense on his part,

1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:47.480
 but mostly because I just, I messed up.

1:14:48.280 --> 1:14:53.280
 And then after that, games five, six, and seven,

1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:56.200
 not much happened.

1:14:56.200 --> 1:15:00.080
 I was getting impatient at that point.

1:15:00.080 --> 1:15:04.360
 So for game eight, I was probably ready

1:15:04.360 --> 1:15:07.400
 to take a little bit more risks than I had

1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:11.360
 before, which I guess was insane

1:15:11.360 --> 1:15:14.480
 because I knew that he couldn't beat me

1:15:14.480 --> 1:15:15.800
 unless I beat myself.

1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:20.320
 Like he wasn't strong enough to outplay me.

1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:22.400
 And that was leading to impatience somehow?

1:15:22.400 --> 1:15:23.560
 And impatience.

1:15:23.560 --> 1:15:25.960
 No, because I knew that I was better.

1:15:25.960 --> 1:15:27.000
 I knew that I was better.

1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:28.880
 I knew that I just needed to win one game

1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:30.320
 and then the match is over.

1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:32.680
 That's what happened in 2021 as well.

1:15:32.680 --> 1:15:34.680
 Like when I won the first game against Nebo,

1:15:34.680 --> 1:15:35.840
 I knew that the match was over

1:15:35.840 --> 1:15:38.160
 unless I like fuck up royally,

1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:42.240
 then he's not gonna be able to beat me.

1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:44.920
 So what happened was that I played

1:15:44.920 --> 1:15:47.160
 a kind of an innocuous opening as White,

1:15:48.160 --> 1:15:49.400
 just trying to get a game,

1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:51.920
 trying to get him out of book as soon as possible.

1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:52.760
 Then...

1:15:52.760 --> 1:15:53.600
 Okay, can you elaborate?

1:15:53.600 --> 1:15:55.640
 Innocuous, get him out of the book.

1:15:56.960 --> 1:16:00.040
 No, basically I set up pretty defensively as White.

1:16:00.040 --> 1:16:04.360
 I wasn't really crossing into his half at the start at all.

1:16:04.360 --> 1:16:07.200
 I was just, I played more like a system

1:16:07.200 --> 1:16:09.920
 more than like a concrete opening.

1:16:09.920 --> 1:16:12.480
 It was like, I'm gonna set up my pieces this way.

1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:14.840
 You can set them up however you want.

1:16:14.840 --> 1:16:18.240
 And then later where sort of the armies are gonna meet.

1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:20.560
 I'm not gonna try and bother you at the start.

1:16:20.560 --> 1:16:22.520
 And that means you're gonna have

1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:24.000
 with as many pieces as possible

1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:26.040
 kind of pure chess in the middle game

1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:28.960
 without any of the lines,

1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:31.080
 the standard lines in the opening.

1:16:31.080 --> 1:16:32.160
 Exactly.

1:16:32.160 --> 1:16:33.680
 And so there was at some point

1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:34.720
 a couple of exchanges,

1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:38.120
 then some maneuvering, a little bit better.

1:16:38.120 --> 1:16:40.000
 Then he was sort of equalizing

1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:42.280
 and then I started to take too many risks.

1:16:42.280 --> 1:16:44.480
 And I was still sort of fine,

1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:48.480
 but then at some point I realized

1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:50.640
 that I'd gone a bit too far

1:16:50.640 --> 1:16:52.280
 and I had to be really careful.

1:16:52.280 --> 1:16:53.920
 Then I just froze.

1:16:53.920 --> 1:16:56.120
 I just completely froze.

1:16:57.120 --> 1:16:57.960
 Mentally?

1:16:57.960 --> 1:16:58.800
 Yeah, mentally.

1:16:58.800 --> 1:16:59.720
 What happened?

1:16:59.720 --> 1:17:04.720
 I realized that all the thoughts of I might lose this.

1:17:05.480 --> 1:17:07.360
 What have I done?

1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:08.840
 Why did I take so many risks?

1:17:08.840 --> 1:17:11.040
 I knew that I could have drawn at any moment.

1:17:11.040 --> 1:17:12.560
 Just be patient.

1:17:12.560 --> 1:17:15.600
 Don't give him these opportunities.

1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:18.840
 What triggered that phase transition in your mind?

1:17:18.840 --> 1:17:22.640
 No, it was just a position on the board.

1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:25.200
 Realizing there was one particular move he played

1:17:25.200 --> 1:17:26.040
 that I missed.

1:17:26.040 --> 1:17:30.960
 And then I realized that this could potentially

1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:32.400
 not go my way.

1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:35.440
 So then I made another couple of mistakes

1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:37.600
 and he, to his credit,

1:17:37.600 --> 1:17:39.600
 once he realized he had the chance,

1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:43.200
 he knew that this was his one chance.

1:17:43.200 --> 1:17:44.960
 He had to take it.

1:17:44.960 --> 1:17:46.720
 And so he did.

1:17:46.720 --> 1:17:51.240
 And yeah, that's the worst I've ever felt

1:17:51.240 --> 1:17:54.000
 after a chess game.

1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:57.640
 I realized that I'm probably gonna lose my title

1:17:57.640 --> 1:18:00.840
 against somebody who's not even close to my level.

1:18:02.040 --> 1:18:07.040
 And I've done it because of my own stupidity, most of all.

1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:12.720
 And that was really, really...

1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:16.160
 At the time, I was all in my own head.

1:18:16.160 --> 1:18:18.480
 That was hard to deal with.

1:18:18.480 --> 1:18:22.440
 And I felt like I didn't really recover too much

1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:24.400
 for the next game.

1:18:24.400 --> 1:18:27.120
 So what I did, there was a free day after the eighth game.

1:18:27.120 --> 1:18:30.040
 So I did something that I never did

1:18:30.040 --> 1:18:31.480
 at any other world championship.

1:18:31.480 --> 1:18:34.560
 Like after game eight, I just,

1:18:35.720 --> 1:18:37.360
 I got drunk with my team.

1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:39.720
 And...

1:18:39.720 --> 1:18:40.720
 That's not a standard procedure.

1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:41.920
 No, no.

1:18:41.920 --> 1:18:43.840
 That's the only time that's happened

1:18:43.840 --> 1:18:46.400
 in the world championship during the match.

1:18:46.400 --> 1:18:50.000
 So yeah, I just tried to forget.

1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.200
 But still before game nine...

1:18:52.200 --> 1:18:54.400
 Game nine, I was a little bit more relaxed,

1:18:55.480 --> 1:18:56.680
 but I was still a bit nervous.

1:18:56.680 --> 1:18:59.760
 Then game nine, I almost lost as well.

1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:02.080
 Then only game 10.

1:19:02.080 --> 1:19:04.520
 Game 10, I was still, I wasn't in a great mood.

1:19:04.520 --> 1:19:06.080
 I was really, really tense.

1:19:07.240 --> 1:19:09.080
 The opening was good.

1:19:09.080 --> 1:19:10.760
 I had some advantage.

1:19:10.760 --> 1:19:11.920
 I was getting optimistic.

1:19:11.920 --> 1:19:13.840
 Then I made one mistake.

1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:15.280
 He could have forced a draw.

1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:18.000
 And then all the negativity came back.

1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.240
 Like, I was thinking during the game,

1:19:20.240 --> 1:19:22.440
 like how am I going to play for a win with Black

1:19:22.440 --> 1:19:23.280
 in the next game?

1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:26.400
 Like, what am I doing?

1:19:26.400 --> 1:19:29.720
 And then, you know, eventually it ended well.

1:19:29.720 --> 1:19:32.880
 It didn't find the right line.

1:19:32.880 --> 1:19:33.880
 I ground him down.

1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:36.320
 Actually, I played at some point pretty well

1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:37.200
 in the end game.

1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:43.080
 And after that game, like there was such a weight.

1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:44.120
 Lifted? Lifted.

1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:47.640
 No, after that, there was like no thought

1:19:47.640 --> 1:19:49.280
 of losing the match whatsoever.

1:19:49.280 --> 1:19:53.920
 I knew that, okay, I'd basically gotten away with,

1:19:54.840 --> 1:19:59.120
 not with murder, but gotten away with something.

1:19:59.120 --> 1:20:02.920
 What can you say about the after game eight?

1:20:02.920 --> 1:20:05.720
 Where are the places you've gone in your mind?

1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:07.440
 Do you go to some dark places?

1:20:07.440 --> 1:20:09.160
 We're talking about like depression.

1:20:09.160 --> 1:20:11.360
 Do you think about quitting at that point?

1:20:12.440 --> 1:20:14.720
 No, I mean, I think about quitting

1:20:14.720 --> 1:20:17.080
 every time I lose a classical game.

1:20:17.080 --> 1:20:18.680
 Or at least I used to.

1:20:18.680 --> 1:20:21.320
 Like, especially if it's in a stupid way,

1:20:21.320 --> 1:20:25.200
 I'm thinking like, okay, if I'm gonna play like this,

1:20:25.200 --> 1:20:27.880
 if I'm gonna do things that I know are wrong,

1:20:27.880 --> 1:20:30.160
 then, you know, I might as well quit.

1:20:30.160 --> 1:20:34.040
 No, that's happened a bunch of times.

1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:37.400
 And I've definitely gotten a bit more carefree

1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:38.840
 about losing these days,

1:20:38.840 --> 1:20:41.000
 which it's not necessarily a good thing.

1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:46.000
 Like my hatred of losing led to me not losing a lot.

1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:49.400
 Losing a lot and it also lit the fire under me

1:20:49.400 --> 1:20:52.560
 that I think my performance after losses

1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:56.040
 in classical chess over the last 10 years

1:20:56.040 --> 1:20:58.040
 is like over 2,900.

1:20:58.040 --> 1:21:01.440
 Like I really play well after a loss,

1:21:01.440 --> 1:21:03.320
 even though it's really, really unpleasant.

1:21:03.320 --> 1:21:07.960
 So apparently like I don't think the way

1:21:07.960 --> 1:21:09.920
 that I dealt with them is particularly healthy,

1:21:09.920 --> 1:21:11.600
 but it's worked.

1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:12.800
 It's worked so far.

1:21:12.800 --> 1:21:15.760
 But then you've discovered now a love for winning

1:21:15.760 --> 1:21:20.360
 to where ultimately longevity wise creates more fun.

1:21:20.360 --> 1:21:21.200
 Yeah, for sure.

1:21:22.600 --> 1:21:26.200
 What's the perfect day in the life of Magnus Carlsen

1:21:26.200 --> 1:21:28.680
 on a day of a big chess match?

1:21:28.680 --> 1:21:30.360
 It doesn't have to be world championship,

1:21:30.360 --> 1:21:33.720
 but if it's a chess match you care about,

1:21:33.720 --> 1:21:35.840
 what time do you wake up?

1:21:35.840 --> 1:21:37.240
 What do you eat?

1:21:37.240 --> 1:21:38.920
 Oh, it depends on when the game is,

1:21:38.920 --> 1:21:42.600
 but let's say the game is at three,

1:21:42.600 --> 1:21:47.600
 I'll probably wake up pretty late at about 11.

1:21:49.440 --> 1:21:54.440
 Then I'll go for a walk,

1:21:55.120 --> 1:21:57.560
 might listen to some podcasts.

1:21:57.560 --> 1:22:00.160
 Maybe I'll spend a little bit of time

1:22:00.160 --> 1:22:04.160
 looking at some NBA game from last night or whatever.

1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:05.480
 So not chess related stuff?

1:22:05.480 --> 1:22:06.920
 No, no, no, no.

1:22:06.920 --> 1:22:11.240
 Then I'll get back, I'll have a big lunch,

1:22:11.240 --> 1:22:13.040
 like usually like a big omelet

1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:15.440
 with a bunch of salad and stuff.

1:22:15.440 --> 1:22:20.440
 Then go to the game, win like a very nice clean game.

1:22:21.440 --> 1:22:22.280
 Perfect day.

1:22:22.280 --> 1:22:24.920
 Just go back after, relax.

1:22:24.920 --> 1:22:28.800
 Like the things that make me the happiest at tournaments

1:22:28.800 --> 1:22:33.560
 is just having a good routine and feeling well.

1:22:33.560 --> 1:22:36.840
 I don't like it when too much is happening around me.

1:22:36.840 --> 1:22:41.480
 So the tournament that I came from now was

1:22:41.480 --> 1:22:44.040
 the Chess Olympiad, which is the team event.

1:22:44.040 --> 1:22:46.280
 So we were a team Norway.

1:22:46.280 --> 1:22:47.600
 We did horribly.

1:22:49.040 --> 1:22:52.200
 I did okay, but the team in general did horribly.

1:22:52.200 --> 1:22:54.320
 You won that Italy?

1:22:54.320 --> 1:22:58.320
 No, no, Italy beat us, but Uzbekistan won in the end.

1:22:58.320 --> 1:23:01.000
 They were this amazing team of young players.

1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:02.920
 It was really impressive.

1:23:02.920 --> 1:23:05.560
 But the thing is like we had a good comradery in the team.

1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:07.320
 We had our meals together.

1:23:07.320 --> 1:23:10.200
 We played a bit of football, went swimming,

1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:13.320
 and I couldn't understand why things went wrong.

1:23:13.320 --> 1:23:14.360
 And I still don't understand.

1:23:14.360 --> 1:23:17.160
 But the thing is for me, it was all very nice,

1:23:17.160 --> 1:23:19.840
 but now I'm so happy to be on my own at a tournament

1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:24.080
 just to have my own routines, not see too many people.

1:23:24.080 --> 1:23:27.520
 Otherwise just have like a very small team of people

1:23:27.520 --> 1:23:28.400
 that I see.

1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:31.000
 You are a kind of celebrity now.

1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:35.600
 So people within the chess tournament and outside

1:23:35.600 --> 1:23:37.640
 would recognize you, want to socialize,

1:23:37.640 --> 1:23:39.600
 want to tell you about how much you mean to them,

1:23:39.600 --> 1:23:41.800
 how much you inspire them, all that kind of stuff.

1:23:41.800 --> 1:23:43.920
 Does that get in the way for you

1:23:43.920 --> 1:23:46.840
 when you're like trying to really focus on the match?

1:23:46.840 --> 1:23:49.120
 Are you able to block that?

1:23:49.120 --> 1:23:51.920
 Like are you able to enjoy those little interactions

1:23:51.920 --> 1:23:53.400
 and still keep your focus?

1:23:53.400 --> 1:23:56.120
 Yeah, most of the time that's fine

1:23:56.120 --> 1:23:57.680
 as long as it's not too much.

1:23:57.680 --> 1:24:01.080
 But I have to admit, when I'm at home in Norway,

1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:07.000
 I rarely go out without big headphones and something.

1:24:10.320 --> 1:24:11.960
 Oh, like a disguise?

1:24:11.960 --> 1:24:15.240
 No, not a disguise, just to block out the world.

1:24:15.240 --> 1:24:16.080
 Yeah.

1:24:16.080 --> 1:24:17.560
 Otherwise...

1:24:17.560 --> 1:24:18.720
 Don't make eye contact?

1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:23.360
 Yeah, no, so the thing is people in general are nice.

1:24:23.360 --> 1:24:25.960
 I mean, people, they wish me well,

1:24:25.960 --> 1:24:29.440
 and they don't bother me.

1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:31.680
 Also, when I have the headphones on,

1:24:31.680 --> 1:24:35.440
 I don't notice as much people turning around and all of that

1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:38.680
 so I can be more of in my own world.

1:24:39.920 --> 1:24:40.840
 So I like that.

1:24:40.840 --> 1:24:45.800
 Yeah, what about in this perfect day after the game?

1:24:45.800 --> 1:24:47.520
 Do you try to analyze what happened?

1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:49.800
 Do you try to think through systematically

1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:52.200
 or do you just kind of loosely think about like...

1:24:52.200 --> 1:24:53.680
 No, I just loosely think about it.

1:24:53.680 --> 1:24:56.840
 I've never been very structured in that sense.

1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:00.240
 I know that it was always recommended

1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:03.040
 that you analyze your own games,

1:25:03.040 --> 1:25:06.880
 but I generally felt that I mostly had a good idea

1:25:06.880 --> 1:25:07.720
 about that.

1:25:07.720 --> 1:25:12.720
 Like nowadays, I will loosely see what the engine says

1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:15.400
 at a certain point if I'm curious about that.

1:25:15.400 --> 1:25:18.640
 Otherwise, I usually move on to the next.

1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:21.320
 What about diet?

1:25:21.320 --> 1:25:23.160
 You said omelet and salad and so on.

1:25:23.160 --> 1:25:26.920
 I heard in your conversation with the other Magnus,

1:25:26.920 --> 1:25:31.920
 Magnus number two, about you had like this bet about meat.

1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:34.000
 One of you are gonna go vegan if you lose,

1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:34.840
 I forget which bet.

1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:36.160
 Vegetarian though.

1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:37.480
 Vegetarian, sorry.

1:25:37.480 --> 1:25:40.280
 And you both have an admiration for meat.

1:25:42.880 --> 1:25:45.720
 Is there some aspect about optimal performance

1:25:45.720 --> 1:25:46.840
 that you look for in food?

1:25:46.840 --> 1:25:50.760
 Like maybe eating only like once or twice a day

1:25:50.760 --> 1:25:52.360
 or a particular kind of food,

1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:54.080
 like meat heavy diet.

1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:55.120
 Is there anything like that?

1:25:55.120 --> 1:25:57.480
 Or are you just trying to have fun with the food?

1:25:57.480 --> 1:26:01.080
 I think whenever I'm at tournaments,

1:26:01.080 --> 1:26:03.760
 like it's very natural to eat,

1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:06.120
 at least for me to eat only twice a day.

1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:08.800
 So usually I do that when I'm at home as well.

1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:11.000
 So you do eat before the tournament though.

1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:12.920
 You don't play fasted.

1:26:12.920 --> 1:26:13.840
 No, no, no, no.

1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:18.840
 But I try not to eat too heavy before the game

1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:22.520
 or in general to avoid sugary stuff

1:26:22.520 --> 1:26:26.760
 to have a pretty stable blood sugar level.

1:26:26.760 --> 1:26:29.040
 Cause that's the easiest way to make mistake

1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:33.560
 that your energy levels just suddenly drop

1:26:33.560 --> 1:26:37.080
 and they don't necessarily need to be too high

1:26:37.080 --> 1:26:39.320
 as long as they're pretty stable, yeah.

1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:41.360
 Have you ever tried playing fasted,

1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:44.600
 like intermittent fasting?

1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:46.960
 So playing without having eaten.

1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:49.000
 I mean, the reason I ask, you know,

1:26:50.640 --> 1:26:52.160
 especially when you do a low carb diet,

1:26:52.160 --> 1:26:54.400
 when I've done a person at low carb diet,

1:26:54.400 --> 1:26:55.880
 I'm able to fast for a long time,

1:26:55.880 --> 1:26:58.520
 like eat once a day, maybe twice a day.

1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:00.680
 But I just, the mind is most focused

1:27:00.680 --> 1:27:05.680
 on like really difficult thinking tasks when it's fasted.

1:27:05.880 --> 1:27:06.720
 It's an interesting,

1:27:06.720 --> 1:27:09.280
 and a lot of people kind of talk about that.

1:27:09.280 --> 1:27:11.480
 Yeah, but you're able to kind of like zoom in

1:27:11.480 --> 1:27:13.120
 and if you're doing a low carb diet,

1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:15.400
 you don't have the energy stable.

1:27:15.400 --> 1:27:17.000
 You know, that is true.

1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:18.840
 Maybe that will be interesting to try.

1:27:18.840 --> 1:27:21.120
 So what's happened for me,

1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:24.520
 I played a few tournaments where I've had food poisoning

1:27:24.520 --> 1:27:26.320
 and then that generally means

1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:31.080
 that you're both sleep deprived and you have no energy.

1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:36.080
 And what I've found is that it makes me,

1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:38.040
 it makes me very calm, of course,

1:27:38.040 --> 1:27:40.600
 because I don't have the energy

1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:42.880
 and it makes me super creative.

1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:43.720
 Interesting.

1:27:43.720 --> 1:27:45.480
 Sleep deprived probably I think in general

1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:47.120
 makes you creative.

1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:48.760
 Just the first thing that goes away

1:27:48.760 --> 1:27:51.800
 is the ability to do the simple things.

1:27:51.800 --> 1:27:54.760
 That's what it affects you the most.

1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:56.560
 Like you cannot be precise.

1:27:56.560 --> 1:27:58.600
 So that's the only thing I'm worried about.

1:27:58.600 --> 1:28:03.600
 Like if I'm fasted that I won't be precise when I play.

1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:08.320
 But you might be more creative.

1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:09.160
 It's an interesting trial.

1:28:09.160 --> 1:28:12.000
 Fasted, yeah, potentially.

1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:14.000
 What about you have been known to

1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.600
 on a rare occasion play drunk.

1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:18.360
 Is there a mathematical formula

1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:22.240
 for sort of on the X axis how many drinks you had

1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:26.760
 and on the Y axis your performance slash creativity?

1:28:26.760 --> 1:28:28.360
 Is there like an optimal for,

1:28:28.360 --> 1:28:29.600
 like one of the,

1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:31.800
 would you suggest for the FIDE World Championship

1:28:31.800 --> 1:28:34.120
 that people would be required to drink?

1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:36.440
 Would that change things in interesting ways?

1:28:36.440 --> 1:28:38.200
 Yeah, not at all.

1:28:38.200 --> 1:28:40.880
 Maybe for rapid, but for Blitz,

1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:41.880
 think if you're playing Blitz,

1:28:41.880 --> 1:28:46.880
 you're mostly playing on short calculation and intuition.

1:28:47.400 --> 1:28:50.480
 And I think those are probably enhanced

1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:54.200
 if you've had a little bit of, a little bit to drink.

1:28:54.200 --> 1:28:58.840
 Can you explain the physiology of why that's,

1:28:58.840 --> 1:29:01.080
 why it's enhanced or the?

1:29:01.080 --> 1:29:03.240
 You're just, you're thinking less.

1:29:03.240 --> 1:29:04.840
 You're more confident.

1:29:04.840 --> 1:29:06.160
 Oh yeah, it's confidence.

1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:07.840
 I think it's just confidence.

1:29:07.840 --> 1:29:11.760
 I think also like a lot of people feel like they're better

1:29:11.760 --> 1:29:15.240
 at speaking languages, for instance,

1:29:15.240 --> 1:29:17.000
 if they've drunk a little bit,

1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:19.960
 it's just like removing these barriers.

1:29:19.960 --> 1:29:24.960
 I think that it's a little bit of the same in chess.

1:29:25.240 --> 1:29:27.600
 In 2012, I played the World Blitz Championship.

1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:32.600
 And then I was doing horribly for a long time.

1:29:33.080 --> 1:29:34.920
 I also had food poisoning there.

1:29:34.920 --> 1:29:37.560
 I couldn't play at all for three days.

1:29:37.560 --> 1:29:39.160
 So before the last break,

1:29:39.160 --> 1:29:43.520
 I was like in the middle of the pack, like in,

1:29:43.520 --> 1:29:46.960
 I don't know, 20th place or something.

1:29:46.960 --> 1:29:51.200
 And so I decided like, as the last, last gasp,

1:29:51.200 --> 1:29:54.880
 I'm going to go to the mini bar and just have a few drinks.

1:29:54.880 --> 1:29:58.080
 And what happened is that I came back

1:29:58.080 --> 1:30:02.280
 and I was suddenly relaxed and I was playing fast

1:30:02.280 --> 1:30:03.520
 and I was playing confidence.

1:30:03.520 --> 1:30:05.640
 And I thought I was playing so well.

1:30:05.640 --> 1:30:08.600
 I wasn't playing nearly as well as I thought,

1:30:08.600 --> 1:30:10.080
 but it still helped me.

1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:11.880
 Like I won my remaining eight games.

1:30:11.880 --> 1:30:14.560
 And if there had been one more round,

1:30:14.560 --> 1:30:16.040
 I probably would have won the whole thing.

1:30:16.040 --> 1:30:18.200
 But finally I was second.

1:30:18.200 --> 1:30:20.960
 So generally I wouldn't recommend that,

1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:23.120
 but maybe as the last resort sometimes,

1:30:23.120 --> 1:30:25.920
 like if you feel that you have the ability,

1:30:25.920 --> 1:30:29.480
 like obviously none of this is remotely relevant

1:30:29.480 --> 1:30:31.800
 if you don't feel like you have the ability to begin with.

1:30:31.800 --> 1:30:34.080
 But if you feel like you have the ability,

1:30:34.080 --> 1:30:39.080
 there are just factors that make it impossible

1:30:39.320 --> 1:30:42.040
 for you to show it.

1:30:42.040 --> 1:30:45.200
 Like numbing your mind a bit can probably be a good thing.

1:30:45.200 --> 1:30:47.920
 Yeah, well, it's interesting, especially during training,

1:30:47.920 --> 1:30:51.040
 you have all kinds of sports that have interacted

1:30:51.040 --> 1:30:54.640
 with a lot of athletes and grappling sports.

1:30:54.640 --> 1:30:57.080
 It's different when you train under extreme exhaustion.

1:30:57.080 --> 1:30:59.320
 For example, you start becoming,

1:30:59.320 --> 1:31:01.480
 you start to discover interesting things.

1:31:01.480 --> 1:31:02.920
 You start being more creative.

1:31:02.920 --> 1:31:07.840
 A lot of people, at least in Brazilian jiu jitsu,

1:31:07.840 --> 1:31:09.480
 they'll smoke weed.

1:31:09.480 --> 1:31:12.580
 It creates this kind of anxiety and relaxation

1:31:12.580 --> 1:31:16.040
 that kind of enables that creative aspect.

1:31:16.040 --> 1:31:17.440
 It's interesting for training.

1:31:17.440 --> 1:31:20.420
 Of course you can't rely on any one of those things too much,

1:31:20.420 --> 1:31:22.520
 but it's cool to throw in like a few drinks

1:31:22.520 --> 1:31:25.080
 every once in a while to, yeah.

1:31:25.080 --> 1:31:28.320
 One, first of all, to relax and have fun.

1:31:28.320 --> 1:31:30.580
 And two, to kind of try things differently,

1:31:30.580 --> 1:31:32.480
 to unlock a different part of your brain.

1:31:32.480 --> 1:31:33.720
 Yeah, for sure.

1:31:33.720 --> 1:31:35.880
 What about supplements?

1:31:35.880 --> 1:31:38.440
 Do you, are you a coffee guy?

1:31:38.440 --> 1:31:39.320
 Oh no.

1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:42.600
 I quite like the taste of coffee.

1:31:44.280 --> 1:31:46.320
 But the thing is I've never had a job.

1:31:48.040 --> 1:31:50.720
 So I've never needed to wake up early.

1:31:50.720 --> 1:31:55.720
 So my thought is basically that if I'm tired, I'm tired.

1:31:55.760 --> 1:31:56.920
 That's fine.

1:31:56.920 --> 1:32:01.560
 Then I'll, you know, then I'll work it out.

1:32:01.560 --> 1:32:06.560
 So I don't wanna ever make my brain get used to coffee.

1:32:08.920 --> 1:32:10.440
 Like if you see me drinking coffee,

1:32:10.440 --> 1:32:15.440
 that's, that probably means that I'm massively,

1:32:16.160 --> 1:32:19.080
 massively hungover and I don't,

1:32:19.080 --> 1:32:24.080
 I just want to try anything to make my brain work.

1:32:24.420 --> 1:32:25.260
 Yeah, that's interesting.

1:32:25.260 --> 1:32:27.280
 But for a lot of people, like you said, taste of coffee,

1:32:27.280 --> 1:32:29.560
 for a lot of people coffee is part

1:32:29.560 --> 1:32:31.240
 of a certain kind of ritual.

1:32:31.240 --> 1:32:32.080
 Yeah, for sure.

1:32:32.080 --> 1:32:32.920
 That they enjoy, you know.

1:32:32.920 --> 1:32:34.920
 So, but you can have rituals without that.

1:32:34.920 --> 1:32:36.320
 I know that I would enjoy it a lot.

1:32:36.320 --> 1:32:39.040
 Yeah, just you don't wanna rely on it.

1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:39.880
 Yeah.

1:32:40.840 --> 1:32:44.240
 I also like the taste, so there's no problem there.

1:32:44.240 --> 1:32:46.820
 What about exercise?

1:32:47.680 --> 1:32:51.860
 So how does that, what like, what, you know,

1:32:51.860 --> 1:32:54.120
 a lot of people talk about the extreme

1:32:56.880 --> 1:32:59.000
 stress that chest puts in your body,

1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:00.380
 physically and mentally.

1:33:00.380 --> 1:33:02.880
 How do you prepare for that, to be physically and mentally?

1:33:02.880 --> 1:33:04.160
 Is it just through playing chess,

1:33:04.160 --> 1:33:07.240
 or do you do cardio and any of that kind of stuff?

1:33:07.240 --> 1:33:08.980
 This is kind of it up and down.

1:33:08.980 --> 1:33:13.980
 Like, as I said in 2013, I was in, I was in great shape.

1:33:15.540 --> 1:33:18.880
 Like, I mean, generally I was exercising,

1:33:18.880 --> 1:33:22.400
 doing sports every day, either playing football

1:33:22.400 --> 1:33:26.840
 or tennis or even other, other sports.

1:33:26.840 --> 1:33:28.360
 Otherwise, if I couldn't do that,

1:33:28.360 --> 1:33:33.360
 I would try and take my bike for a ride.

1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:36.680
 I had a few training camps and I played tennis

1:33:36.680 --> 1:33:38.660
 against one of my seconds.

1:33:38.660 --> 1:33:42.000
 Like, he's not a super fit guy,

1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:43.680
 but he's always been very good at tennis.

1:33:43.680 --> 1:33:47.320
 And I never like played in any organized way.

1:33:47.320 --> 1:33:50.280
 And that was like, that was the perfect exercise

1:33:50.280 --> 1:33:54.400
 because I was running around enough

1:33:54.400 --> 1:33:58.600
 to make the games pretty competitive.

1:33:58.600 --> 1:34:01.880
 And it meant that he had to run a bit less as well.

1:34:01.880 --> 1:34:03.880
 But he was just, he said like,

1:34:05.480 --> 1:34:10.480
 he was shocked that if we played like for two hours,

1:34:10.480 --> 1:34:13.480
 I wouldn't flinch at all.

1:34:13.480 --> 1:34:14.320
 Interesting.

1:34:14.320 --> 1:34:15.520
 So like a combination of fun

1:34:16.960 --> 1:34:20.300
 and the differential between skill

1:34:20.300 --> 1:34:21.720
 result in good cardio.

1:34:21.720 --> 1:34:26.720
 Yeah, but it's just that, so in those days I was pretty,

1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:29.200
 I was pretty fit in that sense.

1:34:29.200 --> 1:34:32.880
 I've always liked doing sports, but at times, you know,

1:34:32.880 --> 1:34:34.960
 I think in winter, especially,

1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:37.740
 like I never had like a schedule.

1:34:37.740 --> 1:34:42.200
 So at times I'll let myself go a little bit.

1:34:42.200 --> 1:34:45.640
 And I've always kind of done it more for fun

1:34:45.640 --> 1:34:48.520
 than like for a concrete benefit.

1:34:48.520 --> 1:34:51.920
 But now I'm at least after the pandemic,

1:34:51.920 --> 1:34:52.960
 I was not in great shape.

1:34:52.960 --> 1:34:55.960
 So now I'm trying to get back, get better,

1:34:56.820 --> 1:35:00.080
 get better habits and so on.

1:35:00.080 --> 1:35:05.080
 But I feel like I've always been the poster boy

1:35:06.080 --> 1:35:11.080
 for making being fit a big thing in chess.

1:35:11.760 --> 1:35:14.760
 And I always felt that it was not really a deserve

1:35:14.760 --> 1:35:18.360
 because I never liked doing weights much at all.

1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:23.960
 I run a bit at times, but I never liked it too much.

1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:24.800
 You just love playing sports.

1:35:24.800 --> 1:35:26.520
 I just love playing sports.

1:35:26.520 --> 1:35:28.680
 So that I think people confuse that

1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:31.240
 because I'm not like massively athletic,

1:35:31.240 --> 1:35:35.520
 but I do, I am decent at sports

1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:39.440
 and that sort of helped build that perception.

1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:42.760
 Even though others who are top level chess players,

1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:46.480
 they're more fit like Karana, for instance,

1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:51.480
 he's really, really, his body is really, really strong.

1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:52.480
 It's just that he doesn't.

1:35:52.480 --> 1:35:53.800
 He like goes to the gym and.

1:35:53.800 --> 1:35:57.440
 Yeah, if he doesn't play sports, that's the difference.

1:35:57.440 --> 1:35:59.600
 And the thing about sports is also is just,

1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:02.440
 it's an escape.

1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:05.400
 It helps you forget for a brief moment

1:36:05.400 --> 1:36:09.260
 about like the obsessions, the pursuits of the main thing,

1:36:09.260 --> 1:36:10.100
 which is chess.

1:36:10.100 --> 1:36:12.360
 Yeah, for sure.

1:36:12.360 --> 1:36:16.440
 And I think it's, it also helps your main pursuit

1:36:16.440 --> 1:36:20.200
 to feel that you're even if not mastering,

1:36:20.200 --> 1:36:24.200
 but like doing well in something, in something else.

1:36:24.200 --> 1:36:28.480
 Like I found that if I just juggle a ball,

1:36:28.480 --> 1:36:30.480
 that makes me feel better before a game.

1:36:32.280 --> 1:36:34.680
 So a skilled activity.

1:36:34.680 --> 1:36:35.720
 Juggle of football, yeah.

1:36:35.720 --> 1:36:39.920
 Yeah, skilled activity that you can improve on over time.

1:36:39.920 --> 1:36:42.360
 It like flexes the same kind of muscle,

1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:44.320
 but on the thing that you're much worse at.

1:36:44.320 --> 1:36:45.320
 Yeah.

1:36:45.320 --> 1:36:47.920
 It focuses you, relaxes you, that's really interesting.

1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:52.200
 What's the perfect day in the life of Magnus Carlsen

1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:53.920
 when he's training?

1:36:53.920 --> 1:36:55.960
 So like, what's a good training regimen

1:36:55.960 --> 1:36:59.480
 in terms of, you know, daily kind of training

1:36:59.480 --> 1:37:04.040
 that you have to put in across many days, months, and years

1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:07.080
 to just keep yourself sharp in terms of chess?

1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:10.480
 I would say when I'm at home, I do very little

1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:12.220
 deliberate practice.

1:37:12.220 --> 1:37:14.020
 I've never been that guy at all.

1:37:14.020 --> 1:37:18.880
 Like I could never force myself to just sit down and work.

1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:22.400
 So deliberate practice, just so maybe you can educate me,

1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:25.560
 for some grandmasters, what would that look like?

1:37:25.560 --> 1:37:27.660
 Just doing puzzles kind of thing?

1:37:27.660 --> 1:37:28.500
 Or like?

1:37:28.500 --> 1:37:30.560
 Yeah, doing puzzles and opening analysis.

1:37:30.560 --> 1:37:32.120
 That would be the main things.

1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:34.700
 Studying games?

1:37:34.700 --> 1:37:38.820
 Just studying games, yeah, a little bit.

1:37:38.820 --> 1:37:42.060
 But I feel like that's something that I do.

1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:47.040
 But it's not deliberate, it's like reading an article

1:37:47.040 --> 1:37:48.120
 or reading a book.

1:37:48.120 --> 1:37:48.960
 Got it.

1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:52.680
 Like I love chess books, I'll read just anything

1:37:52.680 --> 1:37:54.520
 and I'll find something interesting.

1:37:54.520 --> 1:37:57.200
 So chess books that are like on openings

1:37:57.200 --> 1:37:58.640
 and stuff like that, or chess books

1:37:58.640 --> 1:38:00.520
 that go over different games?

1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:05.520
 Yeah, books on, so there are three main categories.

1:38:05.520 --> 1:38:07.440
 There are books on openings and there are books

1:38:07.440 --> 1:38:09.520
 on strategy and there are books on chess history

1:38:09.520 --> 1:38:12.740
 and I find all of them very, very interesting.

1:38:12.740 --> 1:38:14.440
 Like what fraction of the day would you say

1:38:14.440 --> 1:38:18.280
 you have a chess board floating somewhere in your head?

1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:20.520
 Meaning like you're thinking about it.

1:38:21.380 --> 1:38:23.580
 Probably be a better question to ask,

1:38:23.580 --> 1:38:26.640
 how many hours a day I don't have a chess board floating.

1:38:26.640 --> 1:38:27.480
 Yeah.

1:38:27.480 --> 1:38:30.640
 I mean it could be just floating there and nothing's

1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:32.520
 happening, but like.

1:38:32.520 --> 1:38:35.860
 I often do it parallel to some other activity though.

1:38:35.860 --> 1:38:37.080
 And what does that look like?

1:38:37.080 --> 1:38:39.900
 Like are you daydreaming like different,

1:38:39.900 --> 1:38:42.240
 is it actual positions you're just fucking around with?

1:38:42.240 --> 1:38:45.560
 Like fumbling with different pieces in your head?

1:38:45.560 --> 1:38:50.120
 Often I've looked at a random game on my phone for instance

1:38:50.120 --> 1:38:53.920
 or in a book and then my brain just keeps going

1:38:53.920 --> 1:38:56.840
 at the same position analyzing it and often it goes

1:38:56.840 --> 1:38:58.560
 all the way to the end game.

1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:02.280
 And those are actual games or you conjure up like fake games?

1:39:02.280 --> 1:39:05.040
 No, they were often based on real games

1:39:05.040 --> 1:39:07.800
 and then I'm thinking like oh, but it wouldn't be

1:39:07.800 --> 1:39:10.600
 more interesting if the pieces were a little bit different

1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:12.920
 and then often I play it out from there.

1:39:12.920 --> 1:39:17.460
 So you don't have, like you don't sit behind a computer

1:39:17.460 --> 1:39:20.960
 or a chess board and you lay out the pieces and then you're.

1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:25.000
 No, I'm not at all a poster boy for deliberate practice.

1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:27.640
 I could never, I could never work that way.

1:39:27.640 --> 1:39:32.640
 My first coach, he gave me some exercises

1:39:33.120 --> 1:39:37.000
 that are at home sometimes, but he realized at some point

1:39:38.120 --> 1:39:39.320
 that wasn't gonna work.

1:39:39.320 --> 1:39:40.380
 Yeah.

1:39:40.380 --> 1:39:44.200
 Because I wouldn't do it really or enjoy it.

1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:48.640
 So what he would do instead is that at the school

1:39:48.640 --> 1:39:50.100
 where I had the trainings with him,

1:39:50.100 --> 1:39:54.200
 there was this massive chess library.

1:39:54.200 --> 1:39:56.800
 So he was just like yeah, pick out books.

1:39:56.800 --> 1:40:00.360
 You can have anything, you can have anything you want.

1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:01.680
 Just pick out books you like

1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:03.360
 and then you give it back the next time.

1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:05.240
 So that's what I did instead.

1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:08.160
 Yeah, I just absolutely raided the,

1:40:08.160 --> 1:40:11.880
 then my next tournament I will try out one of the openings

1:40:11.880 --> 1:40:14.480
 from that book if it was an opening book and so on.

1:40:14.480 --> 1:40:17.560
 Does it feel like a struggle, like challenging?

1:40:17.560 --> 1:40:19.520
 Like to be thinking those positions

1:40:19.520 --> 1:40:20.940
 or is it fun and relaxing?

1:40:20.940 --> 1:40:22.360
 No, it's completely fine.

1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:24.320
 I don't.

1:40:24.320 --> 1:40:26.240
 Like if it's a difficult position to figure out,

1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:27.760
 you know, like to calculate.

1:40:27.760 --> 1:40:29.240
 Then I go on to something else.

1:40:29.240 --> 1:40:30.360
 Okay.

1:40:30.360 --> 1:40:33.920
 Like if I can't figure it out, then you know, I go on.

1:40:35.280 --> 1:40:37.680
 Change it so that it's easier to figure out.

1:40:37.680 --> 1:40:38.920
 There was a point in your life

1:40:38.920 --> 1:40:42.280
 where Kasparov was interested in being your coach

1:40:42.280 --> 1:40:43.520
 or at least training with you.

1:40:43.520 --> 1:40:45.540
 Why did you choose not to go with him?

1:40:45.540 --> 1:40:46.880
 That's a pretty bold move.

1:40:47.840 --> 1:40:49.120
 Was there a good reason for this?

1:40:49.120 --> 1:40:54.120
 No, the first like homework exercise he gave me

1:40:54.580 --> 1:40:58.440
 was to analyze, like he picked out, I think,

1:40:58.440 --> 1:41:00.200
 three or four of my worst losses

1:41:00.200 --> 1:41:05.200
 and he wanted me to analyze them and give him my thoughts.

1:41:05.440 --> 1:41:08.340
 And it wasn't that there were painful losses or anything

1:41:08.340 --> 1:41:10.540
 that that was a problem.

1:41:10.540 --> 1:41:14.200
 I just didn't really enjoy that.

1:41:14.200 --> 1:41:19.200
 Also, I felt that this whole structured approach

1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:20.280
 and everything.

1:41:20.280 --> 1:41:21.120
 Yeah.

1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:23.560
 I just felt like from the start, it was a hassle.

1:41:23.560 --> 1:41:28.160
 So I loved the idea of being able to pick his brain

1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:32.160
 but everything else, I just, you know,

1:41:32.160 --> 1:41:35.800
 couldn't see myself, couldn't see myself enjoying.

1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:38.480
 And at the end of the day,

1:41:38.480 --> 1:41:42.200
 I did then and always have played for fun.

1:41:42.200 --> 1:41:45.200
 That's always been the main reason, so.

1:41:45.200 --> 1:41:46.560
 It's great that you had the confidence

1:41:46.560 --> 1:41:50.460
 to sort of basically turn down the approach

1:41:50.460 --> 1:41:52.760
 of one of the greatest chess players of all time.

1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:54.640
 At that time, probably the greatest chess player

1:41:54.640 --> 1:41:55.780
 of all time.

1:41:55.780 --> 1:41:58.200
 I don't think I thought of it that way.

1:41:58.200 --> 1:42:00.120
 I just thought this is not for me.

1:42:00.120 --> 1:42:01.680
 I wouldn't try another way.

1:42:01.680 --> 1:42:03.260
 I don't think I was particularly thinking

1:42:03.260 --> 1:42:06.240
 that this is my one opportunity or anything.

1:42:06.240 --> 1:42:08.320
 It was just, yeah, I don't enjoy this.

1:42:08.320 --> 1:42:09.600
 Let's try something else.

1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:12.520
 When you were 13, you faced Kasparov

1:42:12.520 --> 1:42:14.400
 and he wasn't able to beat you.

1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:16.960
 Can you go through that match?

1:42:16.960 --> 1:42:17.880
 What did that feel like?

1:42:17.880 --> 1:42:19.040
 How important was that?

1:42:19.040 --> 1:42:20.980
 Was that, how epic was that?

1:42:20.980 --> 1:42:22.740
 We played three games.

1:42:22.740 --> 1:42:25.660
 I lost two and I drew one.

1:42:25.660 --> 1:42:27.040
 Right, but one draw.

1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:28.420
 No, the one draw.

1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:30.400
 And but didn't you say

1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:32.800
 that you kind of had a better position in that?

1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:35.000
 Yeah, I remember that day very well.

1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:36.440
 There was a Blitz game.

1:42:36.440 --> 1:42:38.400
 This was a rapid tournament

1:42:38.400 --> 1:42:41.240
 and there was a Blitz tournament the day before

1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:46.000
 which determined the pairings for the rapid.

1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:47.400
 For people who don't know,

1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:49.320
 super short games are called bullet.

1:42:49.320 --> 1:42:51.880
 Kind of short games are called Blitz.

1:42:51.880 --> 1:42:54.440
 Semi short games are called rapid.

1:42:54.440 --> 1:42:56.080
 Yeah.

1:42:56.080 --> 1:42:59.000
 And classic chess, I guess, is like very super long.

1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:00.120
 Yeah.

1:43:00.120 --> 1:43:02.420
 Yeah, basically, bullet is just never played

1:43:02.420 --> 1:43:03.260
 over the board.

1:43:03.260 --> 1:43:05.200
 So in terms of over the board chess,

1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:06.600
 Blitz is the shortest.

1:43:06.600 --> 1:43:11.300
 Rapid is like a hybrid between classical and Blitz.

1:43:11.300 --> 1:43:12.800
 You need to have the skills to both

1:43:12.800 --> 1:43:15.040
 and then classical is long.

1:43:15.040 --> 1:43:18.480
 The Blitz tournament, which didn't go so well.

1:43:18.480 --> 1:43:19.640
 Like I got a couple of wins,

1:43:19.640 --> 1:43:22.200
 but I was beaten badly in a lot of games,

1:43:22.200 --> 1:43:24.040
 including by Gary.

1:43:24.040 --> 1:43:27.280
 And so there was the pairing that I had to play him

1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:28.720
 which was pretty exciting.

1:43:28.720 --> 1:43:31.640
 So I remember I was so tired after the Blitz tournament.

1:43:31.640 --> 1:43:34.440
 Like I slept for 12 hours or something.

1:43:34.440 --> 1:43:35.840
 Then I woke up like,

1:43:35.840 --> 1:43:37.480
 okay, I'll turn on my computer.

1:43:37.480 --> 1:43:41.240
 I'll search chess space for Kasparov

1:43:41.240 --> 1:43:42.760
 and we'll go from there.

1:43:44.280 --> 1:43:47.160
 So before that, I hadn't spent like a lot of time

1:43:47.160 --> 1:43:49.080
 specifically studying his games.

1:43:49.080 --> 1:43:51.040
 It was super intimidating

1:43:51.040 --> 1:43:54.360
 because a lot of these openings I knew.

1:43:54.360 --> 1:43:56.840
 I was like, oh, he was the first one to play that.

1:43:56.840 --> 1:43:57.920
 Oh, that was his idea.

1:43:57.920 --> 1:43:59.640
 I actually didn't know that.

1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:02.560
 So I was a bit intimidated before we played.

1:44:02.560 --> 1:44:04.600
 Then of course the first game,

1:44:04.600 --> 1:44:08.680
 he arrived a bit late because they changed the time

1:44:08.680 --> 1:44:11.640
 from the first day to the other, which was a bit strange.

1:44:11.640 --> 1:44:13.840
 But everybody else had noticed it but him.

1:44:15.280 --> 1:44:17.720
 Then he tried to surprise me in the opening.

1:44:17.720 --> 1:44:19.880
 I think like psychologically,

1:44:19.880 --> 1:44:21.520
 the situation was not so easy for him.

1:44:21.520 --> 1:44:23.440
 Like clearly it would be embarrassing for him

1:44:23.440 --> 1:44:26.840
 if he didn't win both games against me.

1:44:26.840 --> 1:44:30.800
 Then like I was spending way too much time on my moves

1:44:30.800 --> 1:44:32.200
 because I was playing Kasparov.

1:44:32.200 --> 1:44:33.800
 I was double checking everything too much.

1:44:33.800 --> 1:44:37.520
 Like normally I would be playing pretty fast in those days.

1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:42.240
 And then at some point I calculated better than him.

1:44:42.240 --> 1:44:46.640
 He missed a crucial detail and had a much better position.

1:44:46.640 --> 1:44:48.000
 I couldn't convert it though.

1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:49.680
 I knew what line I had to go for

1:44:50.880 --> 1:44:52.960
 in order to have a chance to win.

1:44:52.960 --> 1:44:55.720
 But I thought like, I'll play a bit more carefully.

1:44:55.720 --> 1:44:56.800
 Maybe I can win still.

1:44:56.800 --> 1:44:58.280
 I couldn't.

1:44:58.280 --> 1:45:01.760
 And then I lost the second game pretty badly,

1:45:01.760 --> 1:45:04.440
 which it wasn't majorly upsetting,

1:45:04.440 --> 1:45:07.320
 but I felt that I had two black games

1:45:07.320 --> 1:45:09.680
 against Kasparov both in the blitz and the rapid

1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:12.800
 and I lost both of them without any fight whatsoever.

1:45:12.800 --> 1:45:14.600
 I wasn't happy about that at all.

1:45:14.600 --> 1:45:19.080
 That was like less than I thought I could be able to do.

1:45:19.080 --> 1:45:24.080
 So to me, yeah, I was proud of that, but it was a gimmick.

1:45:25.840 --> 1:45:30.400
 That was like a very strong IAM that had GM strength.

1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:35.240
 I was like, it can happen that a player of that strength

1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:37.640
 makes a draw against Gary once in a while.

1:45:37.640 --> 1:45:40.520
 But I mean, I understand that I'm 13,

1:45:40.520 --> 1:45:44.680
 but like still I felt a bit more gimmicky than anything.

1:45:44.680 --> 1:45:48.880
 I mean, I guess it's a good thing that made me noticed,

1:45:48.880 --> 1:45:51.640
 but apart from that, it wasn't.

1:45:51.640 --> 1:45:52.960
 And for people who don't know,

1:45:52.960 --> 1:45:56.160
 IAM is international master and GM is grand master.

1:45:56.160 --> 1:45:58.000
 And you were just on the, I guess,

1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:01.280
 on the verge of becoming a youngest grand master ever.

1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:04.200
 I was the second youngest ever.

1:46:04.200 --> 1:46:06.160
 I think I'm like the seventh youngest now.

1:46:06.160 --> 1:46:08.040
 I mean, these kids these days.

1:46:08.040 --> 1:46:08.960
 Kids these days.

1:46:08.960 --> 1:46:10.480
 Yeah.

1:46:10.480 --> 1:46:14.320
 Yeah, but I was the youngest grand master at the time

1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:16.320
 in the world.

1:46:16.320 --> 1:46:17.160
 Yeah.

1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:20.080
 So there is a, you say it's gimmicky,

1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:21.760
 but there's a romantic notions,

1:46:22.880 --> 1:46:26.520
 especially as things have turned out, right?

1:46:26.520 --> 1:46:27.440
 No, for sure.

1:46:27.440 --> 1:46:30.480
 And have you talked to Gary since then about that?

1:46:30.480 --> 1:46:31.560
 No, not really.

1:46:31.560 --> 1:46:33.960
 I think he's immersed.

1:46:33.960 --> 1:46:35.200
 He's still bitter, you think?

1:46:35.200 --> 1:46:36.960
 No, I don't think he's bitter,

1:46:36.960 --> 1:46:41.760
 but I think the game in itself was a bit embarrassing for him.

1:46:41.760 --> 1:46:45.480
 Even he can't see past like...

1:46:45.480 --> 1:46:46.320
 No, no, no.

1:46:46.320 --> 1:46:47.680
 I think he's completely fine with that.

1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:51.000
 I think like in retrospect, it's a good story.

1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:53.280
 He appreciates that.

1:46:53.280 --> 1:46:54.440
 I don't think that's the problem,

1:46:54.440 --> 1:46:58.360
 but it never made sense for me to broach the subject with him.

1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:03.040
 Yeah, it's funny just having interacted with Gary,

1:47:03.040 --> 1:47:04.920
 now having talked to you,

1:47:04.920 --> 1:47:08.560
 there is a little thing you still hate losing.

1:47:08.560 --> 1:47:11.200
 No matter how beautiful like that moment is,

1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:14.480
 because it's like, in a way it's a passing of the baton

1:47:14.480 --> 1:47:17.840
 from like one great champion to another, right?

1:47:17.840 --> 1:47:19.880
 But you still just don't like the fact

1:47:19.880 --> 1:47:22.960
 that you didn't play a good game from Gary's perspective.

1:47:22.960 --> 1:47:24.800
 Like he still is just annoyed probably

1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:27.280
 that he could have played better.

1:47:27.280 --> 1:47:32.280
 And we did, so we did work together in 2009, quite a lot.

1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:38.240
 And that corporation ended early 2010,

1:47:38.720 --> 1:47:42.240
 but we did play a lot of training games in 2009,

1:47:42.240 --> 1:47:47.120
 which was interesting because he was still very, very strong.

1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:49.920
 And at that time it was fairly equal.

1:47:49.920 --> 1:47:51.400
 Like he was out playing me quite a bit,

1:47:51.400 --> 1:47:56.400
 but I was fighting well, so it was pretty even then.

1:47:57.200 --> 1:47:59.720
 So I mean, I appreciate those games a lot more

1:47:59.720 --> 1:48:03.440
 than some random game from when I was 13.

1:48:03.440 --> 1:48:07.160
 And maybe I just don't know what I'm talking about,

1:48:07.160 --> 1:48:12.160
 but I've always found it, at least based on that game,

1:48:12.480 --> 1:48:15.280
 you couldn't tell that I was gonna take his,

1:48:15.280 --> 1:48:17.040
 that I was gonna take his spot.

1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:22.040
 Like I made a horrible blunder and lost to an Uzbek kid

1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:25.360
 in the World Rapid Championship in 2018.

1:48:28.800 --> 1:48:30.680
 And I mean, granted he was part of the team

1:48:30.680 --> 1:48:32.880
 that now won gold in the Chess Olympia,

1:48:32.880 --> 1:48:34.120
 but he wasn't the crucial part.

1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:35.640
 He barely played any games.

1:48:35.640 --> 1:48:37.240
 Like it wasn't like I would think

1:48:37.240 --> 1:48:39.800
 that he would become world champion because he beat me.

1:48:39.800 --> 1:48:42.200
 I'm always skeptical of those who said

1:48:42.200 --> 1:48:44.520
 that they knew that I was gonna be world champion

1:48:44.520 --> 1:48:48.320
 after that game or at all at that time.

1:48:48.320 --> 1:48:50.080
 I mean, it was easy to see

1:48:50.080 --> 1:48:52.720
 that I would become a very, very strong player.

1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:53.760
 Everybody could see that,

1:48:53.760 --> 1:48:57.400
 but to be the best in the world or one of the best ever,

1:48:57.400 --> 1:48:59.440
 that's hard to say.

1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:01.600
 It is hard to say, but I do remember seeing Messi

1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:03.440
 when he was 16 and 17.

1:49:05.320 --> 1:49:07.600
 But hasn't that happened with other players though?

1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:10.840
 Yeah, but I just had a personal experience.

1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:14.400
 He did look different than, there's like magic there.

1:49:14.400 --> 1:49:18.360
 Maybe you can't tell he would be one of the greatest ever,

1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:19.920
 but there's still magic.

1:49:19.920 --> 1:49:20.760
 But you're right.

1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:22.800
 Most of the time we try to project,

1:49:22.800 --> 1:49:25.320
 we see a young kid being an older person

1:49:25.320 --> 1:49:26.520
 and you start to think,

1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:28.280
 okay, this could be the next great person.

1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:30.200
 Then we forget when they don't become that.

1:49:30.200 --> 1:49:31.040
 Yeah, exactly.

1:49:31.040 --> 1:49:33.320
 That's I think what happens.

1:49:33.320 --> 1:49:34.800
 But when it does become.

1:49:34.800 --> 1:49:38.240
 Or maybe some people are just so good

1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:40.040
 at seeing these patterns that they can actually see.

1:49:40.040 --> 1:49:41.440
 Aren't you supposed to do that kind of thing

1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:44.040
 with fantasy football, like see the long shot

1:49:44.040 --> 1:49:46.480
 and bet on them and then they turn out to be good?

1:49:46.480 --> 1:49:47.320
 That's the whole point.

1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:49.600
 No, you make a lot of long shot bets

1:49:49.600 --> 1:49:52.000
 and then some of them come good.

1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:54.440
 And then people call you a genius for making the bet.

1:49:54.440 --> 1:49:56.760
 Well, let me ask you the goat question again,

1:49:56.760 --> 1:49:59.200
 from fantasy perspective.

1:49:59.200 --> 1:50:02.720
 Can you make the case for the greatest chess player

1:50:02.720 --> 1:50:07.080
 of all time for each yourself, Magnus Carlsen,

1:50:07.080 --> 1:50:09.240
 for Garry Kasparov, I don't know who else,

1:50:09.240 --> 1:50:12.400
 Bobby Fischer, Mikhail Atal, anyone else,

1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:16.400
 for Hikaru Nakamura?

1:50:16.400 --> 1:50:17.240
 Just kidding.

1:50:17.240 --> 1:50:22.040
 Yeah, I think I can make a case for myself,

1:50:22.040 --> 1:50:23.640
 for Garry and for Fischer.

1:50:23.640 --> 1:50:25.600
 So I'll start with Fischer.

1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:28.880
 For him, it's very, very simple.

1:50:30.240 --> 1:50:33.560
 He was ahead of his time, but that's like intangible.

1:50:33.560 --> 1:50:35.840
 You can say that about a lot of people.

1:50:35.840 --> 1:50:40.840
 But he had a peak from 1970 to 72

1:50:40.840 --> 1:50:43.680
 when he was so much better than the others.

1:50:43.680 --> 1:50:46.040
 He won 20 games in a row.

1:50:46.040 --> 1:50:49.720
 Also the way that he played was so powerful

1:50:49.720 --> 1:50:51.520
 and with so few mistakes

1:50:51.520 --> 1:50:54.200
 that he just had no opposition there.

1:50:54.200 --> 1:50:59.200
 So he had just a peak that's been better than anybody.

1:51:00.200 --> 1:51:02.000
 The gap between first and second was the highest.

1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:04.760
 The gap between him and others was greater

1:51:04.760 --> 1:51:08.760
 than it's ever been in history at any other time.

1:51:08.760 --> 1:51:12.840
 And that would be the argument for him.

1:51:12.840 --> 1:51:17.840
 For Garry, he's played in a very competitive era

1:51:18.400 --> 1:51:21.440
 and he's beaten several generations.

1:51:21.440 --> 1:51:26.440
 He was the best, well, he was the consensus best player,

1:51:26.480 --> 1:51:29.520
 I would say for almost 20 years,

1:51:29.520 --> 1:51:34.520
 which nobody else has done at least in recent time.

1:51:36.520 --> 1:51:38.040
 So the longevity.

1:51:38.040 --> 1:51:39.680
 The longevity for sure.

1:51:39.680 --> 1:51:44.680
 Also at his peak, he was not quite the level of Fisher

1:51:46.160 --> 1:51:49.520
 in terms of the gap, but it was similar to,

1:51:49.520 --> 1:51:52.880
 or I think even a little bit better than mine.

1:51:52.880 --> 1:51:57.400
 As for me, I'm of course unbeaten

1:51:57.400 --> 1:52:00.200
 as a world champion in five tries.

1:52:00.200 --> 1:52:04.440
 I've been world number one for 11 years straight

1:52:04.440 --> 1:52:07.680
 in an even more competitive era than Garry.

1:52:07.680 --> 1:52:10.040
 I have the highest chest rating of all time.

1:52:10.040 --> 1:52:15.040
 I have the longest streak ever without losing a game.

1:52:15.320 --> 1:52:19.120
 I think for me, the main argument would be about the era

1:52:19.120 --> 1:52:24.120
 where the engines have leveled the playing field so much

1:52:26.800 --> 1:52:28.680
 that it's harder to dominate.

1:52:28.680 --> 1:52:32.640
 And still, I haven't always been a clear number one,

1:52:32.640 --> 1:52:35.000
 but I've been number one for 11 years.

1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:39.440
 And for a lot of the time, the gap has been pretty big.

1:52:39.440 --> 1:52:43.360
 So I think there are decent arguments for all of them.

1:52:43.360 --> 1:52:45.680
 I've said before, and I haven't changed my mind

1:52:45.680 --> 1:52:48.040
 that Garry generally edges it

1:52:48.040 --> 1:52:51.680
 because of the longevity in the competitive era,

1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:55.000
 but there are arguments.

1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:56.760
 But people also talk about you

1:52:56.760 --> 1:52:58.280
 in terms of the style of play.

1:52:58.280 --> 1:53:01.440
 So it's not just about dominance or the height or the,

1:53:01.440 --> 1:53:05.360
 it's like just the creative genius of it.

1:53:05.360 --> 1:53:07.200
 Yeah, but I'm not interested in that.

1:53:07.200 --> 1:53:11.600
 In terms of greatest of all time,

1:53:11.600 --> 1:53:16.240
 I'm not interested in questions of style.

1:53:16.240 --> 1:53:20.280
 So for Messi, you don't give credit for the style,

1:53:20.280 --> 1:53:21.160
 for the stylistic.

1:53:21.160 --> 1:53:24.320
 I like, no, I like watching it, I just.

1:53:24.320 --> 1:53:27.280
 But you're not gonna give points for the,

1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:30.400
 so Messi gets the best ever because of the finishing.

1:53:30.400 --> 1:53:34.360
 Yeah, it's the, no, it's not because of the finishing,

1:53:34.360 --> 1:53:37.520
 it's because of his overall impact on the game.

1:53:37.520 --> 1:53:39.360
 It's higher than anybody else's.

1:53:39.360 --> 1:53:40.200
 Okay.

1:53:41.440 --> 1:53:45.280
 He contributes, he just contributes more to winning

1:53:45.280 --> 1:53:46.960
 than anybody else does.

1:53:46.960 --> 1:53:51.000
 What's, so you're somebody who was advocated for

1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:53.760
 and has done quite a bit of study of classic games.

1:53:53.760 --> 1:53:58.760
 What would you say is, I mean, maybe the number one

1:53:58.760 --> 1:54:01.960
 or maybe top three games of chess ever played?

1:54:01.960 --> 1:54:04.440
 That doesn't interest me at all.

1:54:04.440 --> 1:54:05.760
 You don't think of them, that was very curious.

1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:06.600
 No, I don't think of it.

1:54:06.600 --> 1:54:09.000
 I mean, I try to, I find the games interesting.

1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:12.200
 I try to learn from them, but like trying to rank them

1:54:12.200 --> 1:54:13.200
 has never interested me.

1:54:13.200 --> 1:54:16.600
 What games pop out to you as like super interesting then?

1:54:16.600 --> 1:54:20.640
 Is there things like where idea, like old school games

1:54:20.640 --> 1:54:25.640
 where there was like interesting ideas that you go back,

1:54:25.640 --> 1:54:29.240
 that you go back or like you find surprising

1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:32.160
 and pretty cool that those ideas are developed like that?

1:54:34.280 --> 1:54:35.440
 Is there something that jumps to mind?

1:54:35.440 --> 1:54:40.360
 Yeah, there are several games of young Kasparov,

1:54:40.360 --> 1:54:43.200
 like before he became world champion.

1:54:43.200 --> 1:54:45.880
 If you're gonna ask for like my favorite player

1:54:45.880 --> 1:54:47.760
 or favorite style, that's probably.

1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:48.760
 Young Kasparov.

1:54:48.760 --> 1:54:49.600
 Young Kasparov.

1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:52.720
 Can you describe stylistically or in any other way

1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:57.080
 what young Kasparov was like that you like?

1:54:57.080 --> 1:54:59.880
 It was just an overflow energy in his play.

1:54:59.880 --> 1:55:00.920
 So aggressive.

1:55:00.920 --> 1:55:04.240
 Yeah, extremely aggressive, dynamic chess.

1:55:04.240 --> 1:55:09.240
 It probably appeals to me a lot because these are the things

1:55:09.800 --> 1:55:11.400
 that I cannot do as well,

1:55:13.280 --> 1:55:15.720
 that it just feels very special to me.

1:55:15.720 --> 1:55:17.760
 But yeah, in terms of games,

1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:21.840
 I never thought about that too much.

1:55:23.120 --> 1:55:28.120
 Is there memories, big or small, weird, surprising,

1:55:29.360 --> 1:55:33.880
 just any kind of beautiful anecdote from your chess career?

1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:37.040
 Like stuff that pops out that people might not know about?

1:55:37.040 --> 1:55:39.960
 Just stuff when you look back, it just makes you smile.

1:55:39.960 --> 1:55:44.960
 No, so I'll tell you about the most satisfying

1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:46.640
 tournament victory of my career.

1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:51.640
 So that was the Norwegian championship under 11 in 2000.

1:55:52.280 --> 1:55:55.840
 Before that tournament, I was super anxious

1:55:56.800 --> 1:56:00.000
 because I started like kind of late at chess.

1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.720
 I played my first tournament when I was eight and a half.

1:56:02.720 --> 1:56:05.080
 And a lot of my competitors had already played

1:56:05.080 --> 1:56:09.040
 for a couple of years or even three, four years

1:56:09.040 --> 1:56:10.440
 at that point.

1:56:10.440 --> 1:56:12.040
 And the first time I,

1:56:12.040 --> 1:56:15.360
 so I played the under 11 championship in 99.

1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:18.040
 I was like a little over the middle of the pack.

1:56:18.040 --> 1:56:20.000
 I'd never played against any of them before.

1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:22.120
 So I didn't know what to expect at all.

1:56:22.120 --> 1:56:23.720
 And then over the next year,

1:56:24.680 --> 1:56:26.680
 I was just like edging a little bit closer.

1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:28.720
 In each tournament, I felt like I was getting

1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:29.960
 a little bit better.

1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:32.520
 And when we had the championship,

1:56:32.520 --> 1:56:34.520
 I knew that I was ready,

1:56:34.520 --> 1:56:38.800
 that I was now at the same level of the best players.

1:56:38.800 --> 1:56:41.240
 I was so anxious to show it.

1:56:41.240 --> 1:56:42.840
 I remember I was just,

1:56:42.840 --> 1:56:45.560
 the feeling of excitement and nervousness

1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:47.840
 before the tournament was incredible.

1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:51.520
 The tournament was weird because I started out,

1:56:51.520 --> 1:56:54.080
 I gave away a draw to a weaker player,

1:56:56.280 --> 1:56:57.920
 whom I shouldn't have drawn to.

1:56:57.920 --> 1:57:00.200
 And then I drew against the other guy

1:57:01.640 --> 1:57:05.560
 who was clearly like the best or second best.

1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:08.400
 And at that point, I thought it was over

1:57:08.400 --> 1:57:12.840
 because I thought he wouldn't give away points to others.

1:57:12.840 --> 1:57:16.120
 And then the very next day he lost to somebody.

1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:18.280
 So then the rest of the tournament,

1:57:18.280 --> 1:57:19.200
 it was just like,

1:57:19.200 --> 1:57:21.960
 I was always like playing my game and watching his.

1:57:21.960 --> 1:57:24.680
 And we both won the rest of our games,

1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:27.080
 but it meant that I was half a point ahead.

1:57:27.080 --> 1:57:30.600
 Like the feeling when I realized that I was gonna win,

1:57:32.320 --> 1:57:34.280
 that was just so amazing.

1:57:34.280 --> 1:57:39.280
 It was like the first time that I was the best at my age.

1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:43.720
 And at that point.

1:57:43.720 --> 1:57:44.560
 You were hooked.

1:57:44.560 --> 1:57:46.200
 Yeah, at that point I realized,

1:57:48.240 --> 1:57:49.840
 I could actually be very good at this.

1:57:49.840 --> 1:57:51.800
 So you kind of saw,

1:57:51.800 --> 1:57:53.680
 what did you think your ceiling would be?

1:57:53.680 --> 1:57:57.320
 Did you see that one day you could be the number one?

1:57:57.320 --> 1:57:59.760
 No, I didn't think that was possible at all.

1:58:01.160 --> 1:58:02.000
 But.

1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:02.840
 When did you first?

1:58:02.840 --> 1:58:05.160
 I could be the best in Norway.

1:58:05.160 --> 1:58:06.120
 The best in Norway?

1:58:06.120 --> 1:58:07.040
 At that point.

1:58:07.040 --> 1:58:07.880
 When did you first?

1:58:07.880 --> 1:58:09.960
 Because like I started relatively late.

1:58:09.960 --> 1:58:10.800
 Right, so yeah.

1:58:10.800 --> 1:58:12.200
 And also like,

1:58:14.240 --> 1:58:17.000
 I knew that I studied a lot more than the others.

1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:19.720
 I knew that I had a passion that they didn't have.

1:58:19.720 --> 1:58:23.720
 They saw chess as something like,

1:58:24.800 --> 1:58:26.600
 it was a hobby.

1:58:26.600 --> 1:58:27.920
 It was like an activity.

1:58:27.920 --> 1:58:32.080
 It was like going to football practice

1:58:32.080 --> 1:58:34.040
 or any other sports.

1:58:34.040 --> 1:58:35.040
 Like you go,

1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:37.480
 you practice like once or twice a week,

1:58:37.480 --> 1:58:39.480
 and then you play a tournament at the weekend.

1:58:39.480 --> 1:58:41.120
 That's what you did.

1:58:41.120 --> 1:58:42.480
 For me, it wasn't like that.

1:58:42.480 --> 1:58:46.000
 Like I would go with my books and my board

1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:47.800
 every day after school.

1:58:49.240 --> 1:58:52.360
 And I would just constantly

1:58:53.320 --> 1:58:55.640
 be trying to learn new things.

1:58:55.640 --> 1:58:59.400
 I had like two hours of internet time

1:58:59.400 --> 1:59:01.040
 on the computer each week.

1:59:01.040 --> 1:59:03.680
 And I would always spend them on chess.

1:59:04.880 --> 1:59:09.880
 Like I think before I was 13 or 14,

1:59:10.520 --> 1:59:15.280
 I'd never opened a browser

1:59:15.280 --> 1:59:17.680
 for any other reason than to play chess.

1:59:19.160 --> 1:59:22.000
 Would you describe that as love or as obsession

1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:23.880
 or something in between?

1:59:23.880 --> 1:59:24.960
 It's everything?

1:59:24.960 --> 1:59:25.800
 Yeah, everything.

1:59:25.800 --> 1:59:30.360
 Yeah, everything, so I mean,

1:59:30.360 --> 1:59:32.560
 it wasn't hard for me to tell at that point

1:59:32.560 --> 1:59:36.480
 that I had something that the other kids didn't

1:59:36.480 --> 1:59:41.040
 because I was never the one to grasp something

1:59:41.040 --> 1:59:41.960
 very, very quickly.

1:59:41.960 --> 1:59:44.160
 But once I started, I always got hooked

1:59:44.160 --> 1:59:46.240
 and then I never stopped learning.

1:59:46.240 --> 1:59:47.320
 What would you say,

1:59:47.320 --> 1:59:49.280
 you've talked about the middle game

1:59:49.280 --> 1:59:52.640
 as a place where you can play pure chess.

1:59:52.640 --> 1:59:56.320
 What do you think is beautiful to you about chess?

1:59:56.320 --> 1:59:58.560
 Like the thing when you were 11.

1:59:58.560 --> 2:00:01.880
 What is beautiful to me is when your opponent

2:00:01.880 --> 2:00:04.320
 can predict every single one of your moves

2:00:04.320 --> 2:00:05.320
 and they still lose.

2:00:06.200 --> 2:00:07.120
 How does that happen?

2:00:07.120 --> 2:00:10.680
 No, like it means that at some point early,

2:00:10.680 --> 2:00:14.160
 your planning, your evaluation has been better.

2:00:14.160 --> 2:00:17.200
 So that you play just very simply, very clearly.

2:00:17.200 --> 2:00:19.960
 It looks like you did nothing special

2:00:19.960 --> 2:00:22.320
 and your opponent lost without a chance.

2:00:22.320 --> 2:00:24.720
 So you're, how do you think about that?

2:00:24.720 --> 2:00:26.680
 By the way, are you basically narrowed down

2:00:26.680 --> 2:00:29.200
 this gigantic tree of options

2:00:29.200 --> 2:00:32.880
 to where your opponent has less and less and less options

2:00:32.880 --> 2:00:35.400
 to win, to escape, and then they're trapped.

2:00:35.400 --> 2:00:36.240
 That's it.

2:00:36.240 --> 2:00:37.640
 Essentially.

2:00:37.640 --> 2:00:40.080
 Is there some aspect to the patterns themselves,

2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:44.080
 to the positions, to the elegance of like

2:00:45.600 --> 2:00:48.800
 the dynamics of the game that you just find beautiful

2:00:48.800 --> 2:00:52.840
 that doesn't, that where you forget about the opponent?

2:00:53.960 --> 2:00:58.280
 General, I try and create harmony on the board.

2:00:58.280 --> 2:01:01.680
 Like what I would usually find harmonious is that

2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:07.560
 the pieces work together, that they protect each other

2:01:08.720 --> 2:01:13.640
 and that there are no pieces that are suboptimally placed.

2:01:13.640 --> 2:01:17.000
 Or if they are suboptimally placed,

2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:19.080
 they can be improved pretty easily.

2:01:19.080 --> 2:01:23.320
 Like I hate when I have one piece that I know

2:01:23.320 --> 2:01:26.000
 is badly placed and I can't improve it.

2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:28.840
 When, yeah, when you're thinking about the harmony

2:01:28.840 --> 2:01:30.560
 of the pieces, when you're looking at the position,

2:01:30.560 --> 2:01:35.560
 you're evaluating it, are you looking at the whole board

2:01:36.760 --> 2:01:41.760
 or is it like a bunch of groupings of pieces overlapping?

2:01:42.280 --> 2:01:44.480
 I would like dancing together kind of thing.

2:01:44.480 --> 2:01:47.320
 I would say it's more of the latter

2:01:47.320 --> 2:01:50.600
 that would be more precise that you look.

2:01:50.600 --> 2:01:55.000
 I mean, I look mostly closer to the middle,

2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:57.640
 but then I would focus on one,

2:01:57.640 --> 2:02:00.080
 like there are usually like one grouping of pieces

2:02:00.080 --> 2:02:04.520
 on one side and then some more closer to the other side.

2:02:04.520 --> 2:02:08.280
 So I would think of it a little bit that way.

2:02:08.280 --> 2:02:11.920
 So, and everything's kind of gravitating to the middle.

2:02:11.920 --> 2:02:13.920
 If it's going well, then yes.

2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:15.160
 And in harmony.

2:02:15.160 --> 2:02:16.640
 Yeah, in harmony.

2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:20.200
 Or like if you can control the middle,

2:02:20.200 --> 2:02:23.000
 you can more easily attack on both sides.

2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:26.720
 That applies to pretty much any game.

2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:27.640
 It's as simple as that.

2:02:27.640 --> 2:02:32.640
 And like attacking on one side without control of the middle

2:02:32.760 --> 2:02:37.560
 would feel very nonharmonious for me.

2:02:37.560 --> 2:02:40.040
 Like I talked about the 10th game

2:02:40.040 --> 2:02:43.640
 in the World Championship.

2:02:43.640 --> 2:02:45.920
 Like that's the time I was the most nervous.

2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:50.040
 And it was because it was the kind of attack that I hate

2:02:50.040 --> 2:02:53.480
 where you just have to, you're abandoned one side

2:02:53.480 --> 2:02:56.800
 and the attack has to work.

2:02:57.640 --> 2:03:00.080
 There was one side and part of the middle as well,

2:03:00.080 --> 2:03:01.880
 which I didn't control at all.

2:03:01.880 --> 2:03:05.640
 And that's like the opposite of harmony for me.

2:03:05.640 --> 2:03:10.520
 What advice would you give to chess players

2:03:10.520 --> 2:03:14.560
 of different levels, how to improve in chess?

2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:16.920
 Very beginner, complete beginner.

2:03:16.920 --> 2:03:19.800
 I mean, at every level, is there something you can say?

2:03:19.800 --> 2:03:21.760
 It's very hard for me to say.

2:03:21.760 --> 2:03:26.540
 Because I mean, the easiest way is like love chess,

2:03:26.540 --> 2:03:28.080
 be obsessed.

2:03:28.080 --> 2:03:29.320
 Well, that's a really important statement.

2:03:29.320 --> 2:03:31.920
 But that doesn't work for everybody.

2:03:31.920 --> 2:03:34.600
 So I feel like it can feel like a grind.

2:03:34.600 --> 2:03:37.560
 So you're saying the less it can feel like a grind,

2:03:37.560 --> 2:03:40.800
 the better, at least for you.

2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:41.640
 That's for sure.

2:03:41.640 --> 2:03:46.600
 But I'm also very, very skeptical about giving advice

2:03:46.600 --> 2:03:50.920
 because I think, again, my way only works

2:03:50.920 --> 2:03:55.920
 if you have some combination of talent and obsession.

2:03:56.280 --> 2:03:59.600
 So I'm not sure that I'd generally recommend it.

2:03:59.600 --> 2:04:02.920
 Like what I've done doesn't go with

2:04:02.920 --> 2:04:06.520
 what most coaches suggest for their kids.

2:04:06.520 --> 2:04:09.720
 I've been lucky that I've had coaches from early on

2:04:09.720 --> 2:04:11.840
 that have been very, very hands off

2:04:11.840 --> 2:04:14.660
 and just allowed me to do my thing, basically.

2:04:16.040 --> 2:04:17.120
 Well, there's a lot to be said

2:04:17.120 --> 2:04:20.520
 about cultivating the obsession.

2:04:21.440 --> 2:04:24.700
 Like really letting that flourish

2:04:24.700 --> 2:04:26.920
 to where you spend a lot of hours

2:04:28.080 --> 2:04:29.760
 like with the chessboard in your head

2:04:29.760 --> 2:04:31.760
 and it doesn't feel like a struggle.

2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:35.920
 No, so like just letting me do my thing.

2:04:35.920 --> 2:04:37.280
 Like if you give me a bunch of work,

2:04:37.280 --> 2:04:38.520
 it will probably feel like a chore.

2:04:38.520 --> 2:04:39.620
 And if you don't give me,

2:04:39.620 --> 2:04:42.920
 I will spend all of that time on my own

2:04:42.920 --> 2:04:45.160
 without thinking that it's work

2:04:45.160 --> 2:04:49.760
 or without thought that I'm doing this to improve my chess.

2:04:49.760 --> 2:04:52.200
 Well, in terms of learning stuff, like books,

2:04:52.200 --> 2:04:56.280
 there's one thing that's relatively novel

2:04:56.280 --> 2:04:58.120
 from your perspective that people are starting now

2:04:58.120 --> 2:04:59.040
 is there's YouTube.

2:04:59.040 --> 2:05:00.920
 There's a lot of good YouTubers.

2:05:00.920 --> 2:05:02.840
 You're a part time YouTuber.

2:05:02.840 --> 2:05:04.360
 You have stuff on YouTube, I guess.

2:05:04.360 --> 2:05:06.900
 Yeah, I have, but if you've seen my YouTube,

2:05:06.900 --> 2:05:10.560
 it's mostly like, it's carefree.

2:05:10.560 --> 2:05:13.040
 It's generally not high effort content.

2:05:13.040 --> 2:05:16.540
 Yeah, but do you like any particular YouTubers?

2:05:17.580 --> 2:05:19.480
 I could just recommend like stuff I've seen.

2:05:19.480 --> 2:05:23.740
 So Aged Madar, Gotham Chess, Botez Live.

2:05:25.060 --> 2:05:27.680
 I really like St. Louis Chess Club,

2:05:27.680 --> 2:05:32.200
 Daniel Narodetsky, and John Bartholomew.

2:05:32.200 --> 2:05:33.040
 Those are good channels,

2:05:33.040 --> 2:05:34.720
 but is there something you can recommend?

2:05:34.720 --> 2:05:36.280
 No, all of them are good.

2:05:37.400 --> 2:05:41.880
 You know, the best recommendation I could give

2:05:41.880 --> 2:05:45.560
 is Aged Madar, purely.

2:05:45.560 --> 2:05:47.120
 How much did he pay you to say that?

2:05:47.120 --> 2:05:51.200
 No, so the thing about that is that I haven't really,

2:05:51.200 --> 2:05:53.560
 I have, so I can tell you I've never watched

2:05:53.560 --> 2:05:56.800
 any of his videos from start to finish.

2:05:56.800 --> 2:05:59.960
 I'm not like, I'm not the target audience, obviously.

2:05:59.960 --> 2:06:03.840
 But I think the only chess YouTube video

2:06:03.840 --> 2:06:07.080
 that my dad has ever watched from start to finish

2:06:07.080 --> 2:06:11.080
 is Aged Madar, and he said, like,

2:06:11.080 --> 2:06:12.300
 I watched one of his videos,

2:06:12.300 --> 2:06:14.600
 I wanted to know what it was all about,

2:06:14.600 --> 2:06:19.040
 because I think Aged Madar is like the same strength

2:06:19.040 --> 2:06:21.200
 as my father, or maybe just a little bit weaker,

2:06:21.200 --> 2:06:23.280
 like 1900 or something.

2:06:23.280 --> 2:06:25.720
 My father is probably about 2000.

2:06:25.720 --> 2:06:28.120
 And my father has played chess his whole life.

2:06:28.120 --> 2:06:30.200
 He loves, he absolutely loves the game.

2:06:30.200 --> 2:06:32.960
 It was like, that's the only time he's actually sat through

2:06:32.960 --> 2:06:34.880
 one of those videos, and he said, like,

2:06:34.880 --> 2:06:36.560
 yeah, I get it, I enjoy it.

2:06:36.560 --> 2:06:39.360
 So that's the best recommendation I could give.

2:06:39.360 --> 2:06:43.440
 That's the only channel that my father actually enjoys.

2:06:44.280 --> 2:06:45.120
 This is hilarious.

2:06:45.120 --> 2:06:47.360
 I talked to him before this to ask him

2:06:47.360 --> 2:06:48.960
 if he has any questions for you.

2:06:48.960 --> 2:06:52.040
 And he said, no, just do your thing, you know.

2:06:52.040 --> 2:06:54.800
 No, he's so careful, he wouldn't do that.

2:06:54.800 --> 2:06:59.600
 He did mention jokingly about Evan's Gambit, I think.

2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:00.440
 Is that a thing?

2:07:00.440 --> 2:07:01.420
 Evan's Gambit?

2:07:01.420 --> 2:07:03.080
 It's some weird thing he made up.

2:07:03.080 --> 2:07:04.640
 It might be an inside joke.

2:07:04.640 --> 2:07:06.720
 I don't know, but he asked me to.

2:07:06.720 --> 2:07:07.640
 Well, anyway.

2:07:07.640 --> 2:07:10.200
 Yeah, I didn't even get the...

2:07:10.200 --> 2:07:11.860
 It's something he made up.

2:07:11.860 --> 2:07:15.120
 I didn't even realize that he plays the Evan's Gambit.

2:07:15.120 --> 2:07:17.040
 Like, he plays a lot of Gambits that are...

2:07:17.040 --> 2:07:18.380
 Wait, Evan's Gambit is a thing?

2:07:18.380 --> 2:07:19.400
 Yeah, yeah, that's a thing.

2:07:19.400 --> 2:07:22.600
 Like, that's an old opening from the 1800s.

2:07:22.600 --> 2:07:25.160
 Captain Evans apparently invented it.

2:07:25.160 --> 2:07:26.640
 Why would he mention that particular one?

2:07:26.640 --> 2:07:27.480
 Yeah, I don't know.

2:07:27.480 --> 2:07:28.940
 Is there something hilarious about that one?

2:07:28.940 --> 2:07:29.780
 I don't know.

2:07:29.780 --> 2:07:34.360
 I don't think I've ever faced the Evan's Gambit in a game.

2:07:34.360 --> 2:07:37.000
 I feel like both of you are trolling me right now.

2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:42.000
 But I mean, he's played a lot of other Gambits.

2:07:42.800 --> 2:07:45.440
 Maybe this is the one he wanted to mention.

2:07:45.440 --> 2:07:48.880
 So this, maybe this is called the Evan's Gambit as well.

2:07:48.880 --> 2:07:52.480
 But I just know it as like the 2G4 Gambit.

2:07:52.480 --> 2:07:53.760
 Maybe this is the one.

2:07:53.760 --> 2:07:57.880
 Like this one, he has played a bunch.

2:08:00.520 --> 2:08:03.640
 And he's been telling me a lot about his games

2:08:03.640 --> 2:08:04.480
 in this line.

2:08:04.480 --> 2:08:06.480
 It's like, oh, it's not so bad.

2:08:06.480 --> 2:08:08.960
 And I'm like, yeah, but you're a pawn down.

2:08:08.960 --> 2:08:10.760
 Yeah, but I can sort of see it.

2:08:10.760 --> 2:08:12.840
 I can sort of understand it.

2:08:12.840 --> 2:08:15.560
 And he's like, he's proud of the fact

2:08:15.560 --> 2:08:17.760
 that nobody like told him to play this line or anything.

2:08:17.760 --> 2:08:19.920
 He came up with it himself.

2:08:19.920 --> 2:08:23.080
 And there's this, I'll tell you another story

2:08:23.080 --> 2:08:23.920
 about my father.

2:08:23.920 --> 2:08:26.840
 So there's this line that I call,

2:08:26.840 --> 2:08:28.760
 that I called the Henry Carlson line.

2:08:31.760 --> 2:08:34.120
 So at some point, you know,

2:08:34.120 --> 2:08:36.280
 he never knew a lot of openings in chess,

2:08:36.280 --> 2:08:40.960
 but I taught him a couple of openings as black.

2:08:40.960 --> 2:08:45.460
 It's the, it's the Sveshnikov's Sicilian

2:08:45.460 --> 2:08:48.200
 that I played a lot myself also

2:08:48.200 --> 2:08:52.280
 during the world championship in 2018.

2:08:52.280 --> 2:08:55.040
 I won a bunch of games in 2019 as well.

2:08:55.040 --> 2:08:55.880
 So that's one opening.

2:08:55.880 --> 2:08:57.040
 And I also taught him as black

2:08:57.040 --> 2:08:58.680
 to play the Rogozin defense.

2:08:59.960 --> 2:09:02.920
 And then, so the Rogozin defense goes like,

2:09:02.920 --> 2:09:04.160
 goes like this.

2:09:05.160 --> 2:09:08.880
 It's characterized by this bishop move.

2:09:10.680 --> 2:09:14.200
 And so he would play those openings pretty,

2:09:14.200 --> 2:09:16.120
 pretty exclusively as black

2:09:16.120 --> 2:09:17.720
 in the tournaments that he did play.

2:09:17.720 --> 2:09:20.720
 And also the Sveshnikov Sicilian is like,

2:09:20.720 --> 2:09:23.760
 that's the only, two of my sisters play,

2:09:23.760 --> 2:09:26.040
 have played a bunch of chess tournaments as well.

2:09:26.040 --> 2:09:28.960
 And that's the only opening they know as well.

2:09:28.960 --> 2:09:32.240
 So my family's portrait is very narrow.

2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:35.560
 So, so this is the, this is the system.

2:09:35.560 --> 2:09:37.960
 Black goes here and then we all from white takes the pawn

2:09:37.960 --> 2:09:39.200
 and black takes the pawn.

2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:43.720
 So at some point I was watching one of my,

2:09:43.720 --> 2:09:47.440
 my father's online blitz game, blitz game.

2:09:47.440 --> 2:09:52.440
 And as white, he played this, this.

2:09:52.440 --> 2:09:54.320
 So this is called the Karkhan defense.

2:09:54.320 --> 2:09:55.520
 He took the pawn.

2:09:58.160 --> 2:10:00.560
 It was taken back, then he went with the knight.

2:10:02.040 --> 2:10:05.280
 His opponent went here and then he played a bishop here.

2:10:05.280 --> 2:10:08.240
 So I, I'd never seen this opening before.

2:10:08.240 --> 2:10:13.240
 And I was like, wow, how on earth did he come up with that?

2:10:13.360 --> 2:10:15.360
 And he said, no, I just played the Rogozin

2:10:15.360 --> 2:10:16.520
 with the different colors

2:10:16.520 --> 2:10:18.000
 because if the knight was here,

2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:19.640
 it would be the same position.

2:10:19.640 --> 2:10:22.080
 I was like, I never, I was like,

2:10:22.080 --> 2:10:27.080
 how, how am I like one of the best players in the world?

2:10:27.200 --> 2:10:28.960
 And I've never thought about that.

2:10:28.960 --> 2:10:30.800
 So I actually started playing,

2:10:30.800 --> 2:10:34.080
 I started playing this line as white

2:10:34.080 --> 2:10:36.560
 with pretty decent result and then results.

2:10:36.560 --> 2:10:39.400
 And it actually became kind of popular

2:10:39.400 --> 2:10:42.680
 and everybody who asked about the line,

2:10:42.680 --> 2:10:43.680
 it's like, I would always tell them,

2:10:43.680 --> 2:10:45.960
 yeah, that's the Henry Carlson.

2:10:45.960 --> 2:10:48.280
 I wouldn't necessarily explain why it was called that.

2:10:48.280 --> 2:10:50.080
 I would just always call it that.

2:10:50.080 --> 2:10:52.960
 So I really hope at this point, at some point,

2:10:52.960 --> 2:10:56.680
 this line will be, will find its rightful name.

2:10:56.680 --> 2:10:59.920
 In the, yeah, finds its way into the history books.

2:10:59.920 --> 2:11:02.760
 Can you, what, what, what'd you learn about life

2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:03.880
 from your dad?

2:11:03.880 --> 2:11:06.080
 What role has your dad played in your life?

2:11:08.360 --> 2:11:11.640
 He's taught me a lot of things, but most of all,

2:11:11.640 --> 2:11:15.080
 as long as you win a chess, then everything else is fine.

2:11:15.080 --> 2:11:20.080
 I think my, especially my father,

2:11:21.560 --> 2:11:23.400
 but my parents in general, they,

2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:28.120
 they always wanted me to get a good education

2:11:28.120 --> 2:11:31.920
 and find a job and so on.

2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:33.240
 Even though my father loves chess

2:11:33.240 --> 2:11:35.080
 and he wanted me to play chess,

2:11:35.080 --> 2:11:40.080
 I don't think he had any plans for me to be professional.

2:11:40.080 --> 2:11:42.680
 I think things changed at some point.

2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:46.440
 Like I was less and less interested in school

2:11:46.440 --> 2:11:51.440
 and for a long time, we were kind of going back and forth,

2:11:51.440 --> 2:11:54.280
 fighting about that, especially my father,

2:11:54.280 --> 2:11:56.200
 but also my mother a little bit.

2:11:56.200 --> 2:11:58.440
 It was at times a little bit difficult.

2:11:58.440 --> 2:11:59.760
 They wanted you to go to school.

2:11:59.760 --> 2:12:02.840
 Yeah, they sort of wanted me to do more school

2:12:02.840 --> 2:12:04.160
 to have more options.

2:12:04.160 --> 2:12:07.200
 And then I think at some point,

2:12:07.200 --> 2:12:11.720
 they just gave up, but I think that sort of coincided

2:12:11.720 --> 2:12:13.560
 when I was actually starting to make real money

2:12:13.560 --> 2:12:14.400
 off tournaments.

2:12:14.400 --> 2:12:18.840
 And after that, you know, everything's been sort of easy

2:12:18.840 --> 2:12:21.040
 and like terms of the family,

2:12:21.040 --> 2:12:26.040
 like they've never put any pressure on me

2:12:26.040 --> 2:12:29.080
 or they've never put any demands on me.

2:12:29.080 --> 2:12:31.240
 There's just, yeah, my ass has to focus on chess.

2:12:31.240 --> 2:12:34.960
 That's that, that's the thing.

2:12:34.960 --> 2:12:38.800
 That's, that's, that's it.

2:12:38.800 --> 2:12:41.400
 Like, I think they taught me in general

2:12:41.400 --> 2:12:43.920
 to be curious about the world

2:12:43.920 --> 2:12:48.920
 and to get a decent general education,

2:12:49.240 --> 2:12:51.240
 not necessarily from school,

2:12:51.240 --> 2:12:55.720
 but like just knowing about the world around you

2:12:55.720 --> 2:12:58.240
 and knowing history and being, you know,

2:12:58.240 --> 2:13:01.200
 just being interested in society.

2:13:01.200 --> 2:13:04.960
 I think in that sense, they've done well.

2:13:04.960 --> 2:13:07.880
 And he's been with you throughout your chess career.

2:13:07.880 --> 2:13:12.880
 I mean, there's something to be said about just family,

2:13:12.920 --> 2:13:16.000
 support and love that you have that, you know,

2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:18.920
 this world is a lonely place.

2:13:18.920 --> 2:13:21.440
 It's good to have people around you that are like,

2:13:21.440 --> 2:13:24.200
 yeah, they got your back kind of, you know?

2:13:24.200 --> 2:13:25.040
 Yeah.

2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:29.040
 It's a cliche, but I think to some extent,

2:13:29.040 --> 2:13:32.240
 all the people you surround yourself with,

2:13:34.680 --> 2:13:36.760
 they can help you a lot.

2:13:36.760 --> 2:13:41.080
 It's only family that only has their own interests at heart.

2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:45.440
 And so for that reason, like my father's like the only one

2:13:45.440 --> 2:13:49.040
 that's been like constantly in the team

2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:51.360
 that he's always been around.

2:13:51.360 --> 2:13:54.160
 And it's for that reason that I know he has my back,

2:13:54.160 --> 2:13:55.000
 no matter what.

2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:58.920
 Now there's a cliche question here,

2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:03.800
 but let's try to actually get to some deep truth perhaps.

2:14:03.800 --> 2:14:06.280
 But people who don't know much about chess

2:14:06.280 --> 2:14:08.840
 seem to like to use chess as a metaphor

2:14:08.840 --> 2:14:10.720
 for everything in life.

2:14:10.720 --> 2:14:14.520
 But there is some aspect to the decision making

2:14:14.520 --> 2:14:16.440
 to the kind of reasoning involved in chess

2:14:16.440 --> 2:14:19.160
 that's transferable to other things.

2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:23.620
 Can you speak to that in your own life and in general?

2:14:23.620 --> 2:14:27.940
 Like the kind of reasoning involved with chess,

2:14:27.940 --> 2:14:32.460
 how much does that transfer to life out there?

2:14:32.460 --> 2:14:34.940
 It just helps you make decisions.

2:14:34.940 --> 2:14:36.100
 Of all kinds.

2:14:36.100 --> 2:14:38.260
 Yeah, that would be my main takeaway.

2:14:38.260 --> 2:14:40.940
 That you learn to make informed guesses

2:14:40.940 --> 2:14:42.640
 in a limited amount of time.

2:14:43.820 --> 2:14:47.300
 I mean, does it frustrate you when you have

2:14:47.300 --> 2:14:49.340
 geopolitical thinkers and leaders?

2:14:49.340 --> 2:14:51.980
 You know, Henry Kissinger will often talk about

2:14:51.980 --> 2:14:55.780
 geopolitics as a game of chess or 3D chess.

2:14:55.780 --> 2:14:58.300
 Is that too oversimplified of a projection?

2:14:58.300 --> 2:15:02.260
 Or do you think that the kind of deliberations

2:15:02.260 --> 2:15:04.860
 you have on the world stage is similar

2:15:04.860 --> 2:15:08.660
 to the kind of decision making you have on the chessboard?

2:15:08.660 --> 2:15:11.580
 Well, I'm never trying to get reelected

2:15:11.580 --> 2:15:13.060
 when I play a game of chess.

2:15:14.780 --> 2:15:16.820
 There's no special interest, you have to get happy.

2:15:16.820 --> 2:15:18.940
 Yeah, that kind of helps.

2:15:18.940 --> 2:15:23.060
 No, I can understand that.

2:15:23.060 --> 2:15:25.580
 Obviously, for every action, there's a reaction

2:15:25.580 --> 2:15:29.740
 and you have to calculate far ahead.

2:15:29.740 --> 2:15:31.620
 It probably would be a good thing

2:15:31.620 --> 2:15:35.860
 if more big players on the international scene

2:15:35.860 --> 2:15:40.140
 thought a little bit more like a chess player in that sense,

2:15:40.140 --> 2:15:42.460
 like trying to make good decision

2:15:42.460 --> 2:15:46.420
 based on limited amount of data,

2:15:46.420 --> 2:15:49.660
 rather than thinking about other factors,

2:15:49.660 --> 2:15:51.140
 but it's so tough.

2:15:51.140 --> 2:15:55.300
 But it does annoy me when people make moves

2:15:55.300 --> 2:15:58.260
 that they know are wrong for different reasons.

2:15:58.260 --> 2:16:00.460
 And they should know, if they did some calculation,

2:16:00.460 --> 2:16:01.300
 they should know they're wrong.

2:16:01.300 --> 2:16:04.620
 Yeah, exactly, that they should know that are wrong.

2:16:04.620 --> 2:16:08.940
 And so much politics is like,

2:16:08.940 --> 2:16:13.300
 it's, you're often asked to do something

2:16:13.300 --> 2:16:17.340
 when it would be much better to do nothing.

2:16:18.940 --> 2:16:21.900
 Like, no, but that happens in chess all the time,

2:16:21.900 --> 2:16:24.060
 like you have a choice.

2:16:24.060 --> 2:16:28.540
 Like I often tell people that in certain situations,

2:16:28.540 --> 2:16:29.820
 you should not try and win,

2:16:29.820 --> 2:16:32.660
 you should just let your opponent lose.

2:16:32.660 --> 2:16:36.020
 And that happens in politics all the time.

2:16:37.540 --> 2:16:40.540
 But yeah, just let your opponents

2:16:40.540 --> 2:16:42.500
 continue whatever they're doing,

2:16:42.500 --> 2:16:43.340
 and then you'll win.

2:16:43.340 --> 2:16:45.740
 Don't try to do something just to do something.

2:16:45.740 --> 2:16:50.380
 Often, they say in chess that having a bad plan

2:16:50.380 --> 2:16:52.380
 is better than having no plan.

2:16:52.380 --> 2:16:53.860
 It's absolute nonsense.

2:16:55.100 --> 2:16:56.460
 I forget what General said it,

2:16:56.460 --> 2:16:59.980
 but it was like, don't interrupt your enemy

2:16:59.980 --> 2:17:02.020
 when they're making a mistake.

2:17:02.020 --> 2:17:02.860
 I think they're...

2:17:02.860 --> 2:17:07.860
 Also, Petrosian, the former world champion said,

2:17:09.460 --> 2:17:11.940
 when your opponent wants to play Dutch defense,

2:17:11.940 --> 2:17:13.420
 don't stop them.

2:17:13.420 --> 2:17:16.220
 I mean, chess players will know that it's the same thing.

2:17:16.220 --> 2:17:19.780
 I mean, chess players will know that it's the same thing.

2:17:19.780 --> 2:17:21.180
 Actually, this reminds me,

2:17:22.580 --> 2:17:24.060
 is there something you found really impressive

2:17:24.060 --> 2:17:26.180
 about Queen's Gambit, the TV show?

2:17:26.180 --> 2:17:28.140
 You know, that's one of the things that really captivated

2:17:28.140 --> 2:17:30.220
 the public imagination about chess.

2:17:30.220 --> 2:17:32.500
 People who don't play chess became very curious

2:17:32.500 --> 2:17:35.100
 about the game, about the beauty of the game,

2:17:35.100 --> 2:17:37.100
 the drama of the game, all that kind of stuff.

2:17:37.100 --> 2:17:38.900
 Is there, in terms of accuracy,

2:17:38.900 --> 2:17:41.260
 in terms of the actual games played,

2:17:41.260 --> 2:17:44.300
 that you found impressive?

2:17:44.300 --> 2:17:46.980
 First of all, they did the chess well,

2:17:46.980 --> 2:17:48.260
 they did it accurately.

2:17:48.260 --> 2:17:51.740
 And also, they found actual games and positions

2:17:51.740 --> 2:17:53.940
 that I'd never seen before.

2:17:53.940 --> 2:17:55.140
 And it really captivated me.

2:17:55.140 --> 2:17:59.500
 Like, I would not follow the story at times.

2:17:59.500 --> 2:18:01.340
 I was just trying to, wow,

2:18:01.340 --> 2:18:03.900
 where the hell did I find that game?

2:18:03.900 --> 2:18:06.020
 Just trying to solve the positions.

2:18:06.020 --> 2:18:09.380
 So, Beth Harmon, the main character,

2:18:09.380 --> 2:18:13.340
 were you impressed by the play she was doing in the,

2:18:13.340 --> 2:18:15.340
 like, was there a particular style

2:18:15.340 --> 2:18:17.260
 that they developed consistently?

2:18:17.260 --> 2:18:20.700
 She was just, at the end, she was just totally universal.

2:18:20.700 --> 2:18:25.020
 Like, at the start, she was probably a bit too aggressive,

2:18:25.020 --> 2:18:28.060
 but no, she was absolutely universal.

2:18:28.060 --> 2:18:30.980
 Wait, what adjective are you using?

2:18:30.980 --> 2:18:34.900
 Universal in the sense that she could play in any style.

2:18:35.940 --> 2:18:37.020
 Oh, interesting.

2:18:37.020 --> 2:18:38.820
 And was dominant in that way.

2:18:38.820 --> 2:18:41.380
 So, wow, there was a development in style too

2:18:41.380 --> 2:18:42.300
 throughout the show.

2:18:42.300 --> 2:18:43.140
 Yeah, for sure.

2:18:43.140 --> 2:18:44.620
 It's really interesting they did that.

2:18:44.620 --> 2:18:45.860
 Yeah.

2:18:45.860 --> 2:18:49.020
 And it actually happened with me a bit as well.

2:18:49.020 --> 2:18:51.660
 Like, I started out really aggressive.

2:18:51.660 --> 2:18:56.420
 Then I became probably too technical at some point,

2:18:56.420 --> 2:18:58.180
 taking a little bit too few risks

2:18:58.180 --> 2:19:00.020
 and not playing dynamic enough.

2:19:00.020 --> 2:19:03.300
 And then I started to get a little bit better at dynamics

2:19:03.300 --> 2:19:05.260
 so that now I'm,

2:19:05.260 --> 2:19:07.820
 I would say definitely the most universal player

2:19:07.820 --> 2:19:09.860
 in terms of style.

2:19:11.060 --> 2:19:12.260
 Are there any skills in chess

2:19:12.260 --> 2:19:14.340
 that are transferable to poker?

2:19:14.340 --> 2:19:17.700
 So as you're playing around with poker a little bit now,

2:19:17.700 --> 2:19:19.900
 how fundamentally different of a game is it?

2:19:20.940 --> 2:19:24.300
 What I find the most transferable probably is

2:19:24.300 --> 2:19:29.300
 not letting past decisions dictate future thinking.

2:19:30.740 --> 2:19:32.380
 Yeah.

2:19:32.380 --> 2:19:34.740
 But in terms of the patterns in the betting strategies

2:19:34.740 --> 2:19:37.620
 and all that kind of stuff, what about bluffing?

2:19:37.620 --> 2:19:39.660
 I bluff way too much.

2:19:40.860 --> 2:19:42.420
 It does seem you enjoy bluffing

2:19:42.420 --> 2:19:45.900
 and Daniel Negrano was saying that you're quite good at it.

2:19:46.780 --> 2:19:49.580
 But yeah, it has very little material to go by.

2:19:49.580 --> 2:19:50.660
 Sample size is small.

2:19:50.660 --> 2:19:51.580
 Yeah.

2:19:51.580 --> 2:19:53.300
 No, I mean, I enjoy bluffing

2:19:53.300 --> 2:19:57.540
 for more of the gambling aspects, the thrill of.

2:19:57.540 --> 2:19:59.700
 So not the technical aspect of the bluffing

2:19:59.700 --> 2:20:01.940
 like you would on the chessboard?

2:20:01.940 --> 2:20:05.460
 Not bluffing in the same sense, but there is some element.

2:20:05.460 --> 2:20:09.100
 But I do enjoy it on the chessboard.

2:20:09.100 --> 2:20:11.740
 Like if I know that like,

2:20:11.740 --> 2:20:13.900
 oh, I successfully scared away my opponent

2:20:13.900 --> 2:20:16.620
 from making the best move, that's of course satisfying.

2:20:16.620 --> 2:20:20.820
 In that same way, it might be satisfying in poker, right?

2:20:20.820 --> 2:20:22.460
 That you represent something,

2:20:22.460 --> 2:20:25.180
 you scare away your opponent in the same kind of way.

2:20:25.180 --> 2:20:27.540
 And also like you tell a story,

2:20:27.540 --> 2:20:30.460
 you try and tell a story and then they believe it.

2:20:30.460 --> 2:20:32.700
 Yeah, tell a story with your betting,

2:20:32.700 --> 2:20:36.860
 with all the different other cues.

2:20:36.860 --> 2:20:40.260
 Do you like the money aspect, the betting strategies?

2:20:40.260 --> 2:20:43.300
 So it's almost like another layer on top of it, right?

2:20:43.300 --> 2:20:48.300
 Like it's the uncertainty in the cards,

2:20:49.820 --> 2:20:52.620
 but the betting, there's so much freedom to the betting.

2:20:53.620 --> 2:20:54.580
 I'm not very good at that.

2:20:54.580 --> 2:20:58.820
 So I cannot say that I understand it completely.

2:20:58.820 --> 2:21:03.820
 You know, when it comes to different sizing and all that,

2:21:04.020 --> 2:21:05.660
 I just haven't studied it enough.

2:21:05.660 --> 2:21:08.340
 How much of luck is part of poker would you say

2:21:08.340 --> 2:21:12.020
 from what you've seen versus skill?

2:21:12.020 --> 2:21:15.340
 I mean, it's so different in the sense that you can be

2:21:15.340 --> 2:21:16.620
 one of the best players in the world

2:21:16.620 --> 2:21:18.620
 and lose two, three years in a row

2:21:18.620 --> 2:21:23.820
 without that being like a massive outlier.

2:21:23.820 --> 2:21:27.700
 Okay, the thing that more than one person told me

2:21:27.700 --> 2:21:29.780
 that you're very good at is trash talking.

2:21:31.260 --> 2:21:32.860
 I don't think I am.

2:21:32.860 --> 2:21:37.860
 A lot of people who make those observations about me,

2:21:38.460 --> 2:21:40.740
 I think they just expect very, very little.

2:21:40.740 --> 2:21:44.940
 So they expect from the best chess player in the world,

2:21:44.940 --> 2:21:49.500
 that just anything that's non robotic is interesting.

2:21:50.620 --> 2:21:52.580
 Also, when it comes to trash talking,

2:21:52.580 --> 2:21:54.540
 like I have the biggest advantage in the world

2:21:54.540 --> 2:21:56.260
 that I'm the best at what I'm doing.

2:21:56.260 --> 2:21:58.540
 So trash talking becomes very, very, very easy

2:21:58.540 --> 2:21:59.980
 because I can back it up.

2:21:59.980 --> 2:22:01.100
 Yeah.

2:22:01.100 --> 2:22:04.020
 Yeah, but a lot of people that are extremely good at stuff

2:22:04.020 --> 2:22:06.140
 don't trash talk and they're not good at it.

2:22:06.140 --> 2:22:07.580
 I don't think I'm very good at it.

2:22:07.580 --> 2:22:09.980
 It's just that I can back it up,

2:22:09.980 --> 2:22:12.140
 which makes it seem that I'm better.

2:22:12.140 --> 2:22:12.980
 And also.

2:22:12.980 --> 2:22:14.780
 You're even doing it now.

2:22:14.780 --> 2:22:19.020
 Also being non robotic or not completely robotic helps.

2:22:19.020 --> 2:22:20.580
 Yeah, yeah.

2:22:20.580 --> 2:22:22.460
 You're not trash talking, you're just stating facts.

2:22:22.460 --> 2:22:23.420
 That's right.

2:22:23.420 --> 2:22:28.340
 Have you ever considered that there will be trash talking

2:22:28.340 --> 2:22:31.540
 and over the chess board and some of the big tournaments,

2:22:31.540 --> 2:22:34.780
 like adding that kind of component or even talking,

2:22:34.780 --> 2:22:37.700
 you know, would that completely distract

2:22:37.700 --> 2:22:38.860
 from the game of chess?

2:22:38.860 --> 2:22:41.180
 No, I think it could be fun in,

2:22:42.740 --> 2:22:44.500
 when people play off fan games,

2:22:44.500 --> 2:22:46.300
 when they play Blitz games,

2:22:46.300 --> 2:22:48.020
 like people trash talk all the time.

2:22:48.020 --> 2:22:49.620
 It's a normal part of the game.

2:22:49.620 --> 2:22:53.500
 So you emphasize fun a lot.

2:22:53.500 --> 2:22:57.940
 Do you think we're living inside of a simulation

2:22:57.940 --> 2:23:01.020
 that is trying to maximize fun?

2:23:03.940 --> 2:23:08.820
 But that's only happened for the last 100 years or so.

2:23:08.820 --> 2:23:10.420
 No, that's like the.

2:23:10.420 --> 2:23:12.620
 Fun has always been increasing, I think.

2:23:12.620 --> 2:23:13.460
 Yeah, okay.

2:23:13.460 --> 2:23:14.300
 It's always been increasing,

2:23:14.300 --> 2:23:16.860
 but I feel like it's been increasing exponentially.

2:23:18.340 --> 2:23:19.180
 Yeah.

2:23:19.180 --> 2:23:22.540
 I mean, or at least the importance of fun.

2:23:22.540 --> 2:23:24.940
 But I guess it depends on the society as well.

2:23:24.940 --> 2:23:29.740
 Like in the West, we've had such a Christian influence.

2:23:29.740 --> 2:23:33.860
 And I mean, Christianity hasn't exactly embraced

2:23:33.860 --> 2:23:37.260
 the concept of fun over time.

2:23:37.260 --> 2:23:38.380
 Well, actually to push back,

2:23:38.380 --> 2:23:40.540
 I think forbidding certain things

2:23:40.540 --> 2:23:42.260
 kind of makes them more fun.

2:23:42.260 --> 2:23:44.740
 So sometimes I think you need to say,

2:23:44.740 --> 2:23:46.500
 you're not allowed to do this.

2:23:46.500 --> 2:23:48.340
 And then a lot of people start doing it

2:23:48.340 --> 2:23:49.700
 and then they have fun doing that

2:23:49.700 --> 2:23:53.580
 because it's like it's doing a thing

2:23:53.580 --> 2:23:55.500
 in the face of the resistance of the thing.

2:23:55.500 --> 2:23:57.060
 So whenever there's resistance,

2:23:57.060 --> 2:23:59.140
 that does somehow make it more fun.

2:23:59.140 --> 2:24:02.420
 Oppressive regimes has always kind of been

2:24:02.420 --> 2:24:04.140
 kind of good for comedy, no?

2:24:04.140 --> 2:24:06.140
 Like, no, but I heard.

2:24:06.140 --> 2:24:06.980
 Yes.

2:24:06.980 --> 2:24:08.740
 Supposedly like in the Soviet Union,

2:24:08.740 --> 2:24:09.860
 I don't know about fun,

2:24:09.860 --> 2:24:13.660
 but supposedly comedy, like at least underground,

2:24:13.660 --> 2:24:14.500
 it thrived.

2:24:14.500 --> 2:24:16.860
 Yeah, there's a, well, no, it permeates the entire culture.

2:24:16.860 --> 2:24:18.300
 There's a dark humor.

2:24:18.300 --> 2:24:19.140
 Yeah.

2:24:19.140 --> 2:24:21.420
 That sort of the cruelty, the absurdity of life

2:24:21.420 --> 2:24:24.860
 really brings out the humor amongst the populace

2:24:24.860 --> 2:24:26.780
 plus vodka on top of that.

2:24:26.780 --> 2:24:30.060
 But this idea that, for example, Elon Musk has that

2:24:31.860 --> 2:24:34.940
 the most entertaining outcome is the most likely.

2:24:36.220 --> 2:24:39.980
 That it seems like the most absurd, silly, funny thing

2:24:39.980 --> 2:24:41.340
 seems to be the thing that.

2:24:41.340 --> 2:24:44.700
 So it happens more often than it should.

2:24:44.700 --> 2:24:49.140
 And it somehow becomes viral in our modern connected world.

2:24:49.140 --> 2:24:53.340
 And so the fun stuff, the memes spread,

2:24:53.340 --> 2:24:56.780
 and then we start to optimize for the fun meme

2:24:56.780 --> 2:24:58.820
 that seems to be a fundamental property

2:24:58.820 --> 2:25:00.300
 of the reality we live in.

2:25:01.700 --> 2:25:06.460
 And so emerges the fun maximizer in all walks of life,

2:25:06.460 --> 2:25:11.460
 like in chess, in poker, in everything.

2:25:13.340 --> 2:25:14.180
 I think.

2:25:14.180 --> 2:25:15.020
 You're not skeptical.

2:25:15.020 --> 2:25:15.900
 No, I'm not skeptical.

2:25:15.900 --> 2:25:20.260
 I'm just, I'm just taking it all in.

2:25:20.260 --> 2:25:24.020
 But I find it interesting and not at all impossible.

2:25:25.020 --> 2:25:26.700
 Do you ever get lonely?

2:25:26.700 --> 2:25:27.780
 Oh yeah, for sure.

2:25:28.660 --> 2:25:32.540
 Like a chess player's life is by definition pretty lonely

2:25:34.140 --> 2:25:36.620
 because you have nobody else to blame but yourself

2:25:36.620 --> 2:25:39.700
 when you lose or you don't achieve the results

2:25:39.700 --> 2:25:41.180
 that you want to achieve.

2:25:41.180 --> 2:25:44.460
 It's difficult for you to find comfort elsewhere.

2:25:44.460 --> 2:25:46.220
 It's in your own mind.

2:25:46.220 --> 2:25:47.060
 Yeah.

2:25:47.060 --> 2:25:48.460
 It's you versus yourself, really.

2:25:48.460 --> 2:25:49.300
 Yeah, really.

2:25:50.740 --> 2:25:55.140
 But it's, you know, it's part of the profession.

2:25:55.140 --> 2:25:58.460
 But I think any like sport or activity

2:25:58.460 --> 2:26:02.460
 where it's just you and your own mind

2:26:02.460 --> 2:26:04.660
 is just by definition lonely.

2:26:04.660 --> 2:26:06.900
 Are you worried that it destroys you?

2:26:06.900 --> 2:26:08.020
 Oh, not at all.

2:26:08.020 --> 2:26:10.540
 As long as I'm aware of it, then it's fine.

2:26:10.540 --> 2:26:15.540
 And I don't think the inherent loneliness

2:26:15.900 --> 2:26:20.420
 of my profession really affects the rest of my life

2:26:20.420 --> 2:26:21.620
 in a major way.

2:26:23.340 --> 2:26:26.660
 What role does love play in the human condition

2:26:26.660 --> 2:26:30.660
 and in your lonely life of calculation?

2:26:30.660 --> 2:26:40.660
 Well, you know, I'm like everybody else trying, you know...

2:26:40.660 --> 2:26:41.500
 Trying to find love?

2:26:41.500 --> 2:26:43.860
 No, not necessarily like trying to find love.

2:26:43.860 --> 2:26:46.660
 Sometimes I am, sometimes I'm not.

2:26:46.660 --> 2:26:48.460
 I'm just trying to find my way.

2:26:48.460 --> 2:26:49.300
 Yeah.

2:26:49.300 --> 2:26:54.300
 And my love for the game,

2:26:54.540 --> 2:26:55.980
 obviously it comes and goes a little bit,

2:26:55.980 --> 2:26:59.340
 but there's like, there's always at least some level of love.

2:26:59.340 --> 2:27:01.980
 So that doesn't go away.

2:27:01.980 --> 2:27:05.660
 But I think in other parts of life,

2:27:05.660 --> 2:27:10.660
 I think it's just about doing things that make you happy,

2:27:11.220 --> 2:27:12.060
 that give you joy,

2:27:12.060 --> 2:27:16.300
 that also makes you more receptive to love in general.

2:27:16.300 --> 2:27:20.700
 So that has been my approach to love now

2:27:20.700 --> 2:27:25.260
 for quite a while that I'm just trying to live my best life

2:27:25.260 --> 2:27:30.260
 and then the love will come when it comes

2:27:30.540 --> 2:27:33.500
 and in terms of romantic love,

2:27:33.500 --> 2:27:35.820
 it has come and gone in my life.

2:27:35.820 --> 2:27:40.820
 It's not there now, but I'm not worried about that.

2:27:42.740 --> 2:27:45.540
 I'm more worried about, you know, not worried,

2:27:45.540 --> 2:27:50.540
 but more like trying to just be a good version of myself.

2:27:50.900 --> 2:27:53.060
 I cannot always be the best version of myself,

2:27:53.060 --> 2:27:55.060
 but at least try to be good.

2:27:55.060 --> 2:27:56.460
 Yeah, and keep your heart open.

2:27:56.460 --> 2:27:59.380
 What is this Daniel Johnson song?

2:27:59.380 --> 2:28:01.660
 True love will find you in the end.

2:28:01.660 --> 2:28:03.100
 No, it may or may not.

2:28:03.100 --> 2:28:06.180
 But it will only find you if,

2:28:07.300 --> 2:28:08.340
 oh fuck, how does it go?

2:28:08.340 --> 2:28:10.820
 If you're looking, so like you have to be open to it.

2:28:10.820 --> 2:28:11.660
 Yeah.

2:28:11.660 --> 2:28:12.820
 It may or may not.

2:28:12.820 --> 2:28:13.660
 Yeah, yeah.

2:28:13.660 --> 2:28:15.700
 And no matter what, you're gonna lose it in the end

2:28:15.700 --> 2:28:17.980
 because it all ends, the whole thing ends.

2:28:17.980 --> 2:28:19.420
 Yeah, yeah.

2:28:19.420 --> 2:28:22.340
 I don't think stressing over that,

2:28:22.340 --> 2:28:26.380
 like obviously it's so human

2:28:26.380 --> 2:28:28.620
 that you can't help it to some degree,

2:28:28.620 --> 2:28:30.940
 but I feel like stressing over love,

2:28:30.940 --> 2:28:34.940
 that's the blueprint for whether you're looking

2:28:34.940 --> 2:28:39.540
 or you're not looking or you're in a relationship

2:28:39.540 --> 2:28:41.540
 or married or anything,

2:28:41.540 --> 2:28:44.500
 like stressing over it is like the blueprint

2:28:44.500 --> 2:28:46.300
 for being unhappy.

2:28:46.300 --> 2:28:49.260
 Just to clarify confusion I have,

2:28:49.260 --> 2:28:50.260
 just a quick question.

2:28:50.260 --> 2:28:52.460
 How does the knight move?

2:28:52.460 --> 2:28:55.780
 Ha, so the knight moves in an L

2:28:57.020 --> 2:29:01.300
 and unlike in shogi it can move both forwards and backwards.

2:29:02.300 --> 2:29:05.780
 It is quite a nimble piece.

2:29:05.780 --> 2:29:08.140
 It can jump over everything,

2:29:08.140 --> 2:29:10.140
 but it's less happy in open position

2:29:10.140 --> 2:29:14.820
 where it has to move from side to side quickly.

2:29:14.820 --> 2:29:18.180
 I am generally more of a bishops guy myself

2:29:18.180 --> 2:29:19.540
 for the old debate.

2:29:19.540 --> 2:29:24.420
 I just prefer quality over the intangibles,

2:29:24.420 --> 2:29:28.420
 but I can appreciate a good knight once in a while.

2:29:28.420 --> 2:29:30.660
 Last simple question.

2:29:30.660 --> 2:29:33.660
 What's the meaning of life, Magnus Carlsen?

2:29:33.660 --> 2:29:36.180
 There's obviously no meaning to life.

2:29:36.180 --> 2:29:37.500
 Is that obvious?

2:29:37.500 --> 2:29:39.420
 I think we're here by accident.

2:29:39.420 --> 2:29:42.220
 There's no meaning, it ends at some point,

2:29:42.220 --> 2:29:43.580
 but it's still a great thing.

2:29:43.580 --> 2:29:44.420
 So.

2:29:44.420 --> 2:29:47.180
 Yeah, you can still have fun even if there's no meaning.

2:29:47.180 --> 2:29:48.260
 Yeah, you can still have fun.

2:29:48.260 --> 2:29:52.740
 You can try and pursue your goals, whatever they may be,

2:29:52.740 --> 2:29:55.660
 but I'm pretty sure there's no special meaning

2:29:55.660 --> 2:29:59.620
 and trying to find it also doesn't make

2:29:59.620 --> 2:30:01.340
 a whole lot of sense to me.

2:30:01.340 --> 2:30:05.700
 For me, life is both meaningless and meaningful

2:30:05.700 --> 2:30:09.020
 for just being here, trying to make,

2:30:09.020 --> 2:30:10.460
 not necessarily the most of it,

2:30:10.460 --> 2:30:13.140
 but the things that make you happy

2:30:13.140 --> 2:30:15.660
 both short term and also long term.

2:30:15.660 --> 2:30:18.540
 Yeah, it seems to be full of cool stuff to enjoy.

2:30:18.540 --> 2:30:20.300
 It certainly does.

2:30:20.300 --> 2:30:23.460
 And one of those is having a conversation with you.

2:30:23.460 --> 2:30:25.700
 Magnus, it's a huge honor to talk to you.

2:30:25.700 --> 2:30:28.100
 Thank you so much for spending this time with me.

2:30:28.100 --> 2:30:29.900
 I can't wait to see what you do in this world

2:30:29.900 --> 2:30:32.780
 and thank you for creating so much elegance and beauty

2:30:32.780 --> 2:30:34.180
 on the chessboard and beyond.

2:30:34.180 --> 2:30:36.100
 So thanks for talking today, brother.

2:30:36.100 --> 2:30:36.940
 Thank you so much.

2:30:36.940 --> 2:30:38.540
 Thanks for having me.

2:30:38.540 --> 2:30:42.660
 And I wanted to say this at the start,

2:30:42.660 --> 2:30:44.180
 but I never really got the chance.

2:30:44.180 --> 2:30:49.180
 I was always a bit apprehensive about doing this podcast

2:30:49.300 --> 2:30:50.900
 because you are a very smart guy

2:30:50.900 --> 2:30:54.380
 and your audience is very smart

2:30:54.380 --> 2:30:58.980
 and I always had a bit of imposter syndrome.

2:30:58.980 --> 2:31:03.500
 So I'll tell you this now after the podcast.

2:31:03.500 --> 2:31:07.660
 So please do judge me, but I hope you've enjoyed it.

2:31:07.660 --> 2:31:08.500
 I loved it.

2:31:08.500 --> 2:31:09.780
 You're a brilliant man.

2:31:09.780 --> 2:31:12.700
 And I love the fact that you have imposter syndrome

2:31:12.700 --> 2:31:14.500
 because a lot of us do.

2:31:14.500 --> 2:31:17.540
 And so that's beautiful to see even at the very top,

2:31:17.540 --> 2:31:19.340
 but you still feel like an imposter.

2:31:20.460 --> 2:31:21.300
 Thank you, brother.

2:31:21.300 --> 2:31:22.900
 Thanks for talking today.

2:31:22.900 --> 2:31:24.420
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:31:24.420 --> 2:31:25.660
 with Magnus Carlsen.

2:31:25.660 --> 2:31:26.940

 And now let me leave you with some words from Bobby Fischer.

2:31:33.420 --> 2:31:36.900
 Chess is a war over the board.

2:31:36.900 --> 2:31:39.500
 The object is to crush the opponent's mind.

2:31:39.500 --> 2:31:43.460
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
