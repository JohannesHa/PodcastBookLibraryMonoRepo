00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
 The following is a conversation with Carl Friston,

00:03.080 --> 00:06.960
 one of the greatest neuroscientists in history.

00:06.960 --> 00:10.320
 Cited over 245,000 times,

00:10.320 --> 00:13.580
 known for many influential ideas in brain imaging,

00:13.580 --> 00:16.520
 neuroscience, and theoretical neurobiology,

00:16.520 --> 00:19.820
 including especially the fascinating idea

00:19.820 --> 00:23.280
 of the free energy principle for action and perception.

00:24.200 --> 00:28.040
 Carl's mix of humor, brilliance, and kindness,

00:28.040 --> 00:31.160
 to me, are inspiring and captivating.

00:31.160 --> 00:34.120
 This was a huge honor and a pleasure.

00:34.120 --> 00:36.800
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.920

00:41.280 --> 00:42.560
 support it on Patreon,

00:42.560 --> 00:44.560
 or simply connect with me on Twitter,

00:44.560 --> 00:48.100
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

00:48.100 --> 00:50.480
 As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now,

00:50.480 --> 00:52.040
 and never any ads in the middle

00:52.040 --> 00:54.220
 that can break the flow of the conversation.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.540
 I hope that works for you,

00:55.540 --> 00:58.280
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

00:58.280 --> 01:00.880
 This show is presented by Cash App,

01:00.880 --> 01:03.200
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

01:03.200 --> 01:06.280
 When you get it, use code LEXPODCAST.

01:06.280 --> 01:09.400
 Cash App lets you send money to friends by Bitcoin,

01:09.400 --> 01:12.860
 and invest in the stock market with as little as $1.

01:12.860 --> 01:14.480
 Since Cash App allows you to send

01:14.480 --> 01:16.200
 and receive money digitally,

01:16.200 --> 01:20.200
 let me mention a surprising fact related to physical money.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.000
 Of all the currency in the world,

01:22.000 --> 01:25.640
 roughly 8% of it is actual physical money.

01:25.640 --> 01:29.920
 The other 92% of money only exists digitally.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.260
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store,

01:32.260 --> 01:37.040
 Google Play, and use the code LEXPODCAST, you get $10,

01:37.040 --> 01:39.880
 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,

01:39.880 --> 01:42.640
 an organization that is helping to advance robotics

01:42.640 --> 01:45.780
 and STEM education for young people around the world.

01:45.780 --> 01:50.020
 And now, here's my conversation with Carl Friston.

01:50.020 --> 01:53.380
 How much of the human brain do we understand

01:53.380 --> 01:56.580
 from the low level of neuronal communication

01:56.580 --> 02:01.580
 to the functional level to the highest level,

02:01.660 --> 02:04.940
 maybe the psychiatric disorder level?

02:04.940 --> 02:06.420
 Well, we're certainly in a better position

02:06.420 --> 02:08.080
 than we were last century.

02:08.980 --> 02:10.440
 How far we've got to go, I think,

02:10.440 --> 02:12.640
 is almost an unanswerable question.

02:13.520 --> 02:16.040
 So you'd have to set the parameters,

02:16.040 --> 02:20.140
 you know, what constitutes understanding, what level

02:20.140 --> 02:21.740
 of understanding do you want?

02:21.740 --> 02:25.380
 I think we've made enormous progress

02:25.380 --> 02:27.820
 in terms of broad brush principles.

02:29.140 --> 02:32.460
 Whether that affords a detailed cartography

02:32.460 --> 02:35.380
 of the functional anatomy of the brain and what it does,

02:35.380 --> 02:38.140
 right down to the microcircuitry and the neurons,

02:38.140 --> 02:42.220
 that's probably out of reach at the present time.

02:42.220 --> 02:44.900
 So the cartography, so mapping the brain,

02:44.900 --> 02:47.440
 do you think mapping of the brain,

02:47.440 --> 02:50.380
 the detailed, perfect imaging of it,

02:50.380 --> 02:54.100
 does that get us closer to understanding

02:54.100 --> 02:56.060
 of the mind, of the brain?

02:56.060 --> 02:59.100
 So how far does it get us if we have

02:59.100 --> 03:01.580
 that perfect cartography of the brain?

03:01.580 --> 03:03.060
 I think there are lower bounds on that.

03:03.060 --> 03:04.860
 It's a really interesting question.

03:06.340 --> 03:09.220
 And it would determine the sort of scientific career

03:09.220 --> 03:11.640
 you'd pursue if you believe that knowing

03:11.640 --> 03:16.020
 every dendritic connection, every sort of microscopic,

03:16.020 --> 03:18.740
 synaptic structure right down to the molecular level

03:18.740 --> 03:22.260
 was gonna give you the right kind of information

03:22.260 --> 03:25.340
 to understand the computational anatomy,

03:25.340 --> 03:27.180
 then you'd choose to be a microscopist

03:27.180 --> 03:32.180
 and you would study little cubic millimeters of brain

03:32.340 --> 03:33.500
 for the rest of your life.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.300
 If on the other hand you were interested

03:35.300 --> 03:40.300
 in holistic functions and a sort of functional anatomy

03:40.300 --> 03:44.100
 of the sort that a neuropsychologist would understand,

03:44.100 --> 03:46.380
 you'd study brain lesions and strokes,

03:46.380 --> 03:48.460
 just looking at the whole person.

03:48.460 --> 03:50.900
 So again, it comes back to at what level

03:50.900 --> 03:52.980
 do you want understanding?

03:52.980 --> 03:56.140
 I think there are principled reasons not to go too far.

03:57.900 --> 04:01.660
 If you commit to a view of the brain

04:01.660 --> 04:06.660
 as a machine that's performing a form of inference

04:06.660 --> 04:11.660
 and representing things, that level of understanding

04:15.980 --> 04:20.540
 is necessarily cast in terms of probability densities

04:20.540 --> 04:24.180
 and ensemble densities, distributions.

04:24.180 --> 04:27.120
 And what that tells you is that you don't really want

04:27.120 --> 04:30.500
 to look at the atoms to understand the thermodynamics

04:30.500 --> 04:34.420
 of probabilistic descriptions of how the brain works.

04:34.420 --> 04:38.620
 So I personally wouldn't look at the molecules

04:38.620 --> 04:41.700
 or indeed the single neurons in the same way

04:41.700 --> 04:44.060
 if I wanted to understand the thermodynamics

04:44.060 --> 04:47.220
 of some non equilibrium steady state of a gas

04:47.220 --> 04:49.980
 or an active material, I wouldn't spend my life

04:49.980 --> 04:54.200
 looking at the individual molecules

04:54.200 --> 04:55.420
 that constitute that ensemble.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.500
 I'd look at their collective behavior.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.140
 On the other hand, if you go too coarse grain,

05:00.140 --> 05:03.900
 you're gonna miss some basic canonical principles

05:03.900 --> 05:06.300
 of connectivity and architectures.

05:06.300 --> 05:10.020
 I'm thinking here this bit colloquial,

05:10.020 --> 05:13.540
 but this current excitement about high field

05:13.540 --> 05:17.240
 magnetic resonance imaging at seven Tesla, why?

05:17.240 --> 05:19.460
 Well, it gives us for the first time the opportunity

05:19.460 --> 05:22.740
 to look at the brain in action at the level

05:22.740 --> 05:24.700
 of a few millimeters that distinguish

05:24.700 --> 05:27.260
 between different layers of the cortex

05:27.260 --> 05:32.260
 that may be very important in terms of evincing

05:32.260 --> 05:35.260
 generic principles of conical microcircuitry

05:35.260 --> 05:37.620
 that are replicated throughout the brain

05:37.620 --> 05:39.120
 that may tell us something fundamental

05:39.120 --> 05:41.140
 about message passing in the brain

05:41.140 --> 05:44.260
 and these density dynamics or neuronal

05:44.260 --> 05:46.820
 or some more population dynamics

05:46.820 --> 05:49.420
 that underwrite our brain function.

05:49.420 --> 05:52.960
 So somewhere between a millimeter and a meter.

05:53.920 --> 05:57.440
 Lingering for a bit on the big questions if you allow me,

05:58.340 --> 06:01.940
 what to use the most beautiful or surprising characteristic

06:01.940 --> 06:03.420
 of the human brain?

06:03.420 --> 06:06.780
 I think it's hierarchical and recursive aspect.

06:06.780 --> 06:08.680
 It's recurrent aspect.

06:08.680 --> 06:10.820
 Of the structure or of the actual

06:10.820 --> 06:12.920
 representation of power of the brain?

06:12.920 --> 06:15.380
 Well, I think one speaks to the other.

06:15.380 --> 06:18.420
 I was actually answering in a dull minded way

06:18.420 --> 06:20.380
 from the point of view of purely its anatomy

06:20.380 --> 06:22.980
 and its structural aspects.

06:22.980 --> 06:26.740
 I mean, there are many marvelous organs in the body.

06:26.740 --> 06:28.460
 Let's take your liver for example.

06:28.460 --> 06:32.660
 Without it, you wouldn't be around for very long

06:32.660 --> 06:35.980
 and it does some beautiful and delicate biochemistry

06:35.980 --> 06:40.980
 and homeostasis and evolved with a finesse

06:41.140 --> 06:43.020
 that would easily parallel the brain

06:43.020 --> 06:45.140
 but it doesn't have a beautiful anatomy.

06:45.140 --> 06:47.020
 It has a simple anatomy which is attractive

06:47.020 --> 06:48.940
 in a minimalist sense but it doesn't have

06:48.940 --> 06:52.820
 that crafted structure of sparse connectivity

06:52.820 --> 06:55.380
 and that recurrence and that specialization

06:55.380 --> 06:56.380
 that the brain has.

06:56.380 --> 06:58.300
 So you said a lot of interesting terms here.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.700
 So the recurrence, the sparsity,

07:00.700 --> 07:03.540
 but you also started by saying hierarchical.

07:03.540 --> 07:08.540
 So I've never thought of our brain as hierarchical.

07:11.260 --> 07:14.300
 Sort of I always thought it's just like a giant mess,

07:14.300 --> 07:16.740
 interconnected mess where it's very difficult

07:16.740 --> 07:18.180
 to figure anything out.

07:18.180 --> 07:21.860
 But in what sense do you see the brain as hierarchical?

07:21.860 --> 07:24.220
 Well, I see it, it's not a magic soup.

07:24.220 --> 07:28.700
 Which of course is what I used to think

07:28.700 --> 07:33.380
 before I studied medicine and the like.

07:34.460 --> 07:38.740
 So a lot of those terms imply each other.

07:38.740 --> 07:41.700
 So hierarchies, if you just think about

07:41.700 --> 07:43.540
 the nature of a hierarchy,

07:43.540 --> 07:46.020
 how would you actually build one?

07:46.020 --> 07:48.300
 And what you would have to do is basically

07:48.300 --> 07:51.140
 carefully remove the right connections

07:51.140 --> 07:54.740
 that destroy the completely connected soups

07:54.740 --> 07:56.100
 that you might have in mind.

07:56.100 --> 08:00.140
 So a hierarchy is in and of itself defined

08:00.140 --> 08:03.180
 by a sparse and particular connectivity structure.

08:04.420 --> 08:07.500
 I'm not committing to any particular form of hierarchy.

08:08.380 --> 08:10.140
 But your sense is there is some.

08:10.140 --> 08:11.420
 Oh, absolutely, yeah.

08:11.420 --> 08:14.220
 In virtue of the fact that there is a sparsity

08:14.220 --> 08:19.220
 of connectivity, not necessarily of a qualitative sort,

08:19.220 --> 08:20.460
 but certainly of a quantitative sort.

08:20.460 --> 08:25.460
 So it is demonstrably so that the further apart

08:27.460 --> 08:29.220
 two parts of the brain are,

08:29.220 --> 08:32.260
 the less likely they are to be wired,

08:32.260 --> 08:35.820
 to possess axonal processes, neuronal processes

08:35.820 --> 08:39.100
 that directly communicate one message

08:39.100 --> 08:41.140
 or messages from one part of that brain

08:41.140 --> 08:42.660
 to the other part of the brain.

08:42.660 --> 08:44.780
 So we know there's a sparse connectivity.

08:45.820 --> 08:50.300
 And furthermore, on the basis of anatomical connectivity

08:50.300 --> 08:55.300
 in traces studies, we know that that sparsity

08:57.580 --> 09:00.980
 underwrites a hierarchical and very structured

09:00.980 --> 09:05.980
 sort of connectivity that might be best understood

09:07.140 --> 09:09.380
 like a little bit like an onion.

09:09.380 --> 09:14.380
 There is a concentric, sometimes referred to as centripetal

09:15.540 --> 09:17.500
 by people like Marcel Masulam,

09:17.500 --> 09:19.340
 hierarchical organization to the brain.

09:19.340 --> 09:23.860
 So you can think of the brain as in a rough sense,

09:23.860 --> 09:28.060
 like an onion, and all the sensory information

09:28.060 --> 09:31.260
 and all the afferent outgoing messages

09:31.260 --> 09:33.500
 that supply commands to your muscles

09:33.500 --> 09:37.100
 or to your secretory organs come from the surface.

09:37.100 --> 09:40.140
 So there's a massive exchange interface

09:40.140 --> 09:43.020
 with the world out there on the surface.

09:43.020 --> 09:45.140
 And then underneath, there's a little layer

09:45.140 --> 09:49.380
 that sits and looks at the exchange on the surface.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.380
 And then underneath that, there's a layer

09:51.380 --> 09:53.380
 right the way down to the very center,

09:53.380 --> 09:55.740
 to the deepest part of the onion.

09:55.740 --> 09:58.700
 That's what I mean by a hierarchical organization.

09:58.700 --> 10:02.020
 There's a discernible structure defined

10:02.020 --> 10:04.860
 by the sparsity of connections

10:04.860 --> 10:08.620
 that lends the architecture a hierarchical structure

10:08.620 --> 10:12.780
 that tells one a lot about the kinds of representations

10:12.780 --> 10:13.620
 and messages.

10:13.620 --> 10:15.620
 Coming back to your earlier question,

10:15.620 --> 10:18.260
 is this about the representational capacity

10:19.140 --> 10:20.420
 or is it about the anatomy?

10:20.420 --> 10:23.460
 Well, one underwrites the other.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.380
 If one simply thinks of the brain

10:26.380 --> 10:29.100
 as a message passing machine,

10:29.100 --> 10:32.580
 a process that is in the service of doing something,

10:33.460 --> 10:37.500
 then the circuitry and the connectivity

10:37.500 --> 10:42.500
 that shape that message passing also dictate its function.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.980
 So you've done a lot of amazing work

10:44.980 --> 10:46.660
 in a lot of directions.

10:46.660 --> 10:49.260
 So let's look at one aspect of that,

10:49.260 --> 10:51.060
 of looking into the brain

10:51.060 --> 10:53.300
 and trying to study this onion structure.

10:54.980 --> 10:57.660
 What can we learn about the brain by imaging it?

10:57.660 --> 11:00.860
 Which is one way to sort of look at the anatomy of it.

11:00.860 --> 11:04.700
 Broadly speaking, what are the methods of imaging,

11:04.700 --> 11:07.620
 but even bigger, what can we learn about it?

11:07.620 --> 11:12.620
 Right, so well, most human neuroimaging

11:13.820 --> 11:17.540
 that you might see in science journals

11:18.980 --> 11:22.540
 that speaks to the way the brain works,

11:22.540 --> 11:24.340
 measures brain activity over time.

11:24.340 --> 11:26.020
 So that's the first thing to say,

11:26.020 --> 11:30.020
 that we're effectively looking at fluctuations

11:30.020 --> 11:32.580
 in neuronal responses,

11:32.580 --> 11:36.140
 usually in response to some sensory input

11:36.140 --> 11:40.660
 or some instruction, some task.

11:40.660 --> 11:42.260
 Not necessarily, there's a lot of interest

11:42.260 --> 11:43.620
 in just looking at the brain

11:44.740 --> 11:46.860
 in terms of resting state, endogenous,

11:46.860 --> 11:48.940
 or intrinsic activity.

11:48.940 --> 11:50.780
 But crucially, at every point,

11:50.780 --> 11:52.460
 looking at these fluctuations,

11:52.460 --> 11:56.380
 either induced or intrinsic in the neural activity,

11:57.340 --> 11:59.020
 and understanding them at two levels.

11:59.020 --> 12:03.540
 So normally, people would recourse

12:03.540 --> 12:06.260
 to two principles of brain organization

12:06.260 --> 12:07.420
 that are complementary.

12:07.420 --> 12:10.460
 One, functional specialization or segregation.

12:10.460 --> 12:11.860
 So what does that mean?

12:11.860 --> 12:16.300
 It simply means that there are certain parts of the brain

12:16.300 --> 12:19.580
 that may be specialized for certain kinds of processing.

12:19.580 --> 12:21.900
 For example, visual motion,

12:21.900 --> 12:26.060
 our ability to recognize or to perceive movement

12:26.060 --> 12:27.780
 in the visual world.

12:27.780 --> 12:31.100
 And furthermore, that specialized processing

12:31.100 --> 12:34.540
 may be spatially or anatomically segregated,

12:34.540 --> 12:37.060
 leading to functional segregation.

12:37.060 --> 12:40.900
 Which means that if I were to compare your brain activity

12:40.900 --> 12:45.220
 during a period of viewing a static image,

12:45.220 --> 12:49.260
 and then compare that to the responses of fluctuations

12:49.260 --> 12:52.660
 in the brain when you were exposed to a moving image,

12:52.660 --> 12:54.900
 say a flying bird,

12:54.900 --> 12:56.300
 we'd expect to see

12:56.300 --> 13:01.620
 restricted, segregated differences in activity.

13:01.620 --> 13:03.780
 And those are basically the hotspots

13:03.780 --> 13:06.780
 that you see in the statistical parametric maps

13:06.780 --> 13:08.900
 that test for the significance of the responses

13:08.900 --> 13:11.060
 that are circumscribed.

13:11.060 --> 13:13.740
 So now, basically, we're talking about

13:13.740 --> 13:19.300
 some people have perhaps unkindly called a neocartography.

13:19.300 --> 13:24.420
 This is a phrenology augmented by modern day neuroimaging,

13:24.420 --> 13:28.980
 basically finding blobs or bumps on the brain

13:28.980 --> 13:30.860
 that do this or do that,

13:30.860 --> 13:33.100
 and trying to understand the cartography

13:33.100 --> 13:35.700
 of that functional specialization.

13:35.700 --> 13:38.860
 So how much is there such,

13:38.860 --> 13:43.220
 this is such a beautiful sort of ideal to strive for.

13:43.220 --> 13:46.860
 We humans, scientists, would like this,

13:46.860 --> 13:48.980
 to hope that there's a beautiful structure to this

13:48.980 --> 13:51.420
 where it's, like you said, there's segregated regions

13:51.420 --> 13:54.100
 that are responsible for the different function.

13:54.100 --> 13:57.100
 How much hope is there to find such regions

13:57.100 --> 14:00.420
 in terms of looking at the progress of studying the brain?

14:00.420 --> 14:02.740
 Oh, I think enormous progress has been made

14:02.740 --> 14:04.860
 in the past 20 or 30 years.

14:06.860 --> 14:08.940
 So this is beyond incremental.

14:08.940 --> 14:11.940
 At the advent of brain imaging,

14:11.940 --> 14:14.820
 the very notion of functional segregation

14:14.820 --> 14:18.900
 was just a hypothesis based upon a century,

14:18.900 --> 14:21.420
 if not more, of careful neuropsychology,

14:21.420 --> 14:24.660
 looking at people who had lost via insult

14:24.660 --> 14:29.300
 or traumatic brain injury particular parts of the brain,

14:29.300 --> 14:30.780
 and then saying, well, they can't do this

14:30.780 --> 14:32.060
 or they can't do that.

14:32.060 --> 14:34.100
 For example, losing the visual cortex

14:34.100 --> 14:35.620
 and not being able to see,

14:35.620 --> 14:39.580
 or losing particular parts of the visual cortex

14:39.580 --> 14:44.060
 or regions known as V5

14:44.060 --> 14:47.980
 or the middle temporal region, MT,

14:47.980 --> 14:49.580
 and noticing that they selectively

14:49.580 --> 14:51.460
 could not see moving things.

14:51.460 --> 14:55.140
 And so that created the hypothesis

14:55.140 --> 14:59.700
 that perhaps visual movement processing

14:59.700 --> 15:02.740
 was located in this functionally segregated area.

15:02.740 --> 15:05.700
 And you could then go and put invasive electrodes

15:05.700 --> 15:08.260
 in animal models and say, yes, indeed,

15:08.260 --> 15:10.500
 we can excite activity here.

15:10.500 --> 15:13.980
 We can form receptive fields that are sensitive to

15:13.980 --> 15:16.220
 or defined in terms of visual motion.

15:16.220 --> 15:18.340
 But at no point could you exclude the possibility

15:18.340 --> 15:20.020
 that everywhere else in the brain

15:20.020 --> 15:23.140
 was also very interested in visual motion.

15:23.140 --> 15:24.900
 By the way, I apologize to interrupt,

15:24.900 --> 15:26.980
 but a tiny little tangent.

15:26.980 --> 15:31.180
 You said animal models, just out of curiosity,

15:31.180 --> 15:34.460
 from your perspective, how different is the human brain

15:34.460 --> 15:35.460
 versus the other animals

15:35.460 --> 15:38.980
 in terms of our ability to study the brain?

15:38.980 --> 15:43.620
 Well, clearly, the further away you go from a human brain,

15:43.620 --> 15:45.740
 the greater the differences,

15:45.740 --> 15:48.940
 but not as remarkable as you might think.

15:48.940 --> 15:53.180
 So people will choose their level of approximation

15:53.180 --> 15:54.300
 to the human brain,

15:54.300 --> 15:56.540
 depending upon the kinds of questions

15:56.540 --> 15:57.380
 that they want to answer.

15:57.380 --> 16:00.620
 So if you're talking about sort of canonical principles

16:00.620 --> 16:02.780
 of microcircuitry, it might be perfectly okay

16:02.780 --> 16:04.540
 to look at a mouse, indeed.

16:04.540 --> 16:07.220
 You could even look at flies, worms.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.740
 If, on the other hand, you wanted to look at

16:09.740 --> 16:13.100
 the finer details of organization of visual cortex

16:13.100 --> 16:17.420
 and V1, V2, these are designated patches of cortex

16:17.420 --> 16:20.660
 that may do different things, indeed, do.

16:20.660 --> 16:23.340
 You'd probably want to use a primate

16:23.340 --> 16:25.980
 that looked a little bit more like a human,

16:26.940 --> 16:28.260
 because there are lots of ethical issues

16:28.260 --> 16:32.780
 in terms of the use of nonhuman primates

16:32.780 --> 16:37.500
 to answer questions about human anatomy.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.060
 But I think most people assume

16:39.060 --> 16:43.300
 that most of the important principles are conserved

16:43.300 --> 16:48.020
 in a continuous way, right from, well, yes,

16:48.020 --> 16:53.020
 worms right through to you and me.

16:53.260 --> 16:56.900
 So now returning to, so that was the early sort of ideas

16:56.900 --> 17:00.820
 of studying the functional regions of the brain

17:00.820 --> 17:02.860
 by if there's some damage to it,

17:02.860 --> 17:06.140
 to try to infer that that part of the brain

17:06.140 --> 17:09.100
 might be somewhat responsible for this type of function.

17:09.100 --> 17:11.140
 So where does that lead us?

17:11.140 --> 17:12.980
 What are the next steps beyond that?

17:12.980 --> 17:16.140
 Right, well, I'll just actually just reverse a bit,

17:16.140 --> 17:17.860
 come back to your sort of notion

17:17.860 --> 17:19.580
 that the brain is a magic soup.

17:19.580 --> 17:22.580
 That was actually a very prominent idea at one point,

17:23.780 --> 17:27.140
 notions such as Lashley's law of mass action

17:28.140 --> 17:33.140
 inherited from the observation that for certain animals,

17:33.140 --> 17:36.020
 if you just took out spoonfuls of the brain,

17:36.020 --> 17:38.220
 it didn't matter where you took these spoonfuls out,

17:38.220 --> 17:40.420
 they always showed the same kinds of deficits.

17:40.420 --> 17:44.540
 So it was very difficult to infer functional specialization

17:44.540 --> 17:48.300
 purely on the basis of lesion deficit studies.

17:49.260 --> 17:50.820
 But once we had the opportunity

17:50.820 --> 17:52.380
 to look at the brain lighting up

17:52.380 --> 17:57.740
 and it's literally it's sort of excitement, neuronal excitement

17:57.740 --> 18:01.100
 when looking at this versus that,

18:01.100 --> 18:03.260
 one was able to say, yes, indeed,

18:03.260 --> 18:05.020
 these functionally specialized responses

18:05.020 --> 18:08.780
 are very restricted and they're here or they're over there.

18:08.780 --> 18:11.340
 If I do this, then this part of the brain lights up.

18:11.340 --> 18:16.340
 And that became doable in the early 90s.

18:16.900 --> 18:19.100
 In fact, shortly before with the advent

18:19.100 --> 18:21.060
 of positron emission tomography.

18:21.060 --> 18:23.420
 And then functional magnetic resonance imaging

18:23.420 --> 18:26.700
 came along in the early 90s.

18:26.700 --> 18:29.780
 And since that time, there has been an explosion

18:29.780 --> 18:34.780
 of discovery, refinement, confirmation.

18:36.300 --> 18:38.940
 There are people who believe that it's all in the anatomy.

18:38.940 --> 18:40.260
 If you understand the anatomy,

18:40.260 --> 18:43.260
 then you understand the function at some level.

18:43.260 --> 18:45.780
 And many, many hypotheses were predicated

18:45.780 --> 18:49.980
 on a deep understanding of the anatomy and the connectivity,

18:49.980 --> 18:51.260
 but they were all confirmed

18:51.260 --> 18:55.140
 and taken much further with neuroimaging.

18:55.140 --> 18:57.580
 So that's what I meant by we've made an enormous amount

18:57.580 --> 19:01.180
 of progress in this century indeed,

19:01.180 --> 19:03.940
 and in relation to the previous century,

19:03.940 --> 19:08.940
 by looking at these functionally selective responses.

19:09.620 --> 19:11.100
 But that wasn't the whole story.

19:11.100 --> 19:13.580
 So there's this sort of near phrenology,

19:13.580 --> 19:15.620
 but finding bumps and hot spots in the brain

19:15.620 --> 19:16.700
 that did this or that.

19:17.620 --> 19:20.020
 The bigger question was, of course,

19:20.020 --> 19:22.140
 the functional integration.

19:22.140 --> 19:26.980
 How all of these regionally specific responses

19:26.980 --> 19:29.860
 were orchestrated, how they were distributed,

19:29.860 --> 19:32.700
 how did they relate to distributed processing

19:32.700 --> 19:35.580
 and indeed representations in the brain.

19:35.580 --> 19:39.540
 So then you turn to the more challenging issue

19:39.540 --> 19:42.660
 of the integration, the connectivity.

19:42.660 --> 19:44.980
 And then we come back to this beautiful,

19:44.980 --> 19:49.060
 sparse, recurrent, hierarchical connectivity

19:49.060 --> 19:51.140
 that seems characteristic of the brain

19:51.140 --> 19:53.620
 and probably not many other organs.

19:53.620 --> 19:58.260
 But nevertheless, we come back to this challenge

19:58.260 --> 20:01.100
 of trying to figure out how everything is integrated.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.820
 But what's your feeling?

20:02.820 --> 20:04.220
 What's the general consensus?

20:04.220 --> 20:07.820
 Have we moved away from the magic soup view of the brain?

20:07.820 --> 20:10.620
 So there is a deep structure to it.

20:11.940 --> 20:14.460
 And then maybe a further question.

20:14.460 --> 20:16.820
 You said some people believe that the structure

20:16.820 --> 20:19.180
 is most of it, that you can really get

20:19.180 --> 20:20.220
 at the core of the function

20:20.220 --> 20:22.540
 by just deeply understanding the structure.

20:22.540 --> 20:25.180
 Where do you sit on that, do you?

20:25.180 --> 20:28.260
 I think it's got some mileage to it, yes, yeah.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.300
 So it's a worthy pursuit of going,

20:31.180 --> 20:34.780
 of studying through imaging and all the different methods

20:34.780 --> 20:36.260
 to actually study the structure.

20:36.260 --> 20:38.340
 No, absolutely, yeah, yeah.

20:38.340 --> 20:41.180
 Sorry, I'm just noting, you were accusing me

20:41.180 --> 20:42.460
 of using lots of long words

20:42.460 --> 20:44.300
 and then you introduced one there, which is deep,

20:44.300 --> 20:45.380
 which is interesting.

20:46.340 --> 20:50.420
 Because deep is the sort of millennial equivalent

20:50.420 --> 20:51.660
 of hierarchical.

20:51.660 --> 20:53.860
 So if you've put deep in front of anything,

20:53.860 --> 20:57.620
 not only are you very millennial and very trending,

20:57.620 --> 21:01.540
 but you're also implying a hierarchical architecture.

21:01.540 --> 21:05.260
 So it is a depth, which is, for me, the beautiful thing.

21:05.260 --> 21:07.380
 That's right, the word deep kind of,

21:07.380 --> 21:10.260
 yeah, exactly, it implies hierarchy.

21:10.260 --> 21:11.500
 I didn't even think about that.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.620
 That indeed, the implicit meaning

21:14.620 --> 21:16.820
 of the word deep is hierarchy.

21:16.820 --> 21:18.340
 Yep. Yeah.

21:18.340 --> 21:22.380
 So deep inside the onion is the center of your soul.

21:22.380 --> 21:23.500
 Beautifully put.

21:23.500 --> 21:26.780
 Maybe briefly, if you could paint a picture

21:26.780 --> 21:30.980
 of the kind of methods of neuroimaging,

21:30.980 --> 21:33.420
 maybe the history which you were a part of,

21:33.420 --> 21:35.180
 from statistical parametric mapping.

21:35.180 --> 21:37.940
 I mean, just what's out there that's interesting

21:37.940 --> 21:40.540
 for people maybe outside the field

21:40.540 --> 21:43.460
 to understand of what are the actual methodologies

21:43.460 --> 21:45.340
 of looking inside the human brain?

21:45.340 --> 21:47.420
 Right, well, you can answer that question

21:47.420 --> 21:48.300
 from two perspectives.

21:48.300 --> 21:49.900
 Basically, it's the modality.

21:49.900 --> 21:52.580
 What kind of signal are you measuring?

21:52.580 --> 21:55.460
 And they can range from,

21:55.460 --> 21:56.860
 and let's limit ourselves

21:56.860 --> 22:01.060
 to sort of imaging based noninvasive techniques.

22:01.060 --> 22:03.020
 So you've essentially got brain scanners,

22:03.020 --> 22:05.340
 and brain scanners can either measure

22:05.340 --> 22:07.660
 the structural attributes, the amount of water,

22:07.660 --> 22:09.300
 the amount of fat, or the amount of iron

22:09.300 --> 22:10.380
 in different parts of the brain,

22:10.380 --> 22:11.620
 and you can make lots of inferences

22:11.620 --> 22:15.460
 about the structure of the organ of the sort

22:15.460 --> 22:17.780
 that you might have produced from an X ray,

22:17.780 --> 22:21.340
 but a very nuanced X ray that is looking

22:21.340 --> 22:24.380
 at this kind of property or that kind of property.

22:24.380 --> 22:27.860
 So looking at the anatomy noninvasively

22:27.860 --> 22:30.140
 would be the first sort of neuroimaging

22:30.140 --> 22:32.180
 that people might want to employ.

22:32.180 --> 22:34.940
 Then you move on to the kinds of measurements

22:34.940 --> 22:38.100
 that reflect dynamic function,

22:38.100 --> 22:42.020
 and the most prevalent of those fall into two camps.

22:42.020 --> 22:46.460
 You've got these metabolic, sometimes hemodynamic,

22:46.460 --> 22:48.940
 blood related signals.

22:48.940 --> 22:53.460
 So these metabolic and or hemodynamic signals

22:53.460 --> 22:58.380
 are basically proxies for elevated activity

22:58.380 --> 23:03.380
 and message passing and neuronal dynamics

23:03.460 --> 23:05.340
 in particular parts of the brain.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.660
 Characteristically though, the time constants

23:07.660 --> 23:11.420
 of these hemodynamic or metabolic responses

23:11.420 --> 23:14.300
 to neural activity are much longer

23:14.300 --> 23:15.820
 than the neural activity itself.

23:15.820 --> 23:18.020
 And this is referring,

23:19.020 --> 23:20.580
 forgive me for the dumb questions,

23:20.580 --> 23:22.940
 but this would be referring to blood,

23:22.940 --> 23:24.260
 like the flow of blood.

23:24.260 --> 23:25.100
 Absolutely, absolutely.

23:25.100 --> 23:26.500
 So there's a ton of,

23:26.500 --> 23:29.420
 it seems like there's a ton of blood vessels in the brain.

23:29.420 --> 23:30.260
 Yeah.

23:30.260 --> 23:33.700
 So what's the interaction between the flow of blood

23:33.700 --> 23:35.980
 and the function of the neurons?

23:35.980 --> 23:37.420
 Is there an interplay there or?

23:37.420 --> 23:42.420
 Yup, yup, and that interplay accounts for several careers

23:42.780 --> 23:46.180
 of world renowned scientists, yes, absolutely.

23:47.220 --> 23:49.140
 So this is known as neurovascular coupling,

23:49.140 --> 23:50.180
 is exactly what you said.

23:50.180 --> 23:52.300
 It's how does the neural activity,

23:52.300 --> 23:54.620
 the neuronal infrastructure, the actual message passing

23:54.620 --> 23:59.620
 that we think underlies our capacity to perceive and act,

24:01.060 --> 24:06.060
 how is that coupled to the vascular responses

24:06.060 --> 24:09.900
 that supply the energy for that neural processing?

24:09.900 --> 24:13.380
 So there's a delicate web of large vessels,

24:13.380 --> 24:16.420
 arteries and veins, that gets progressively finer

24:16.420 --> 24:18.860
 and finer in detail until it perfuses

24:18.860 --> 24:20.420
 at a microscopic level,

24:20.420 --> 24:23.780
 the machinery where little neurons lie.

24:23.780 --> 24:26.520
 So coming back to this sort of onion perspective,

24:27.420 --> 24:30.500
 we were talking before using the onion as a metaphor

24:30.500 --> 24:32.460
 for a deep hierarchical structure,

24:32.460 --> 24:36.220
 but also I think it's just anatomically quite

24:36.220 --> 24:37.780
 a useful metaphor.

24:37.780 --> 24:40.140
 All the action, all the heavy lifting

24:40.140 --> 24:41.660
 in terms of neural computation is done

24:41.660 --> 24:43.940
 on the surface of the brain,

24:43.940 --> 24:47.380
 and then the interior of the brain is constituted

24:47.380 --> 24:52.380
 by fatty wires, essentially, axonal processes

24:52.980 --> 24:55.940
 that are enshrouded by myelin sheaths.

24:55.940 --> 24:59.620
 And these, when you dissect them, they look fatty and white,

24:59.620 --> 25:01.240
 and so it's called white matter,

25:01.240 --> 25:04.100
 as opposed to the actual neuro pill,

25:04.100 --> 25:07.220
 which does the computation constituted largely by neurons,

25:07.220 --> 25:08.700
 and that's known as gray matter.

25:08.700 --> 25:13.260
 So the gray matter is a surface or a skin

25:13.260 --> 25:16.260
 that sits on top of this big ball,

25:16.260 --> 25:17.780
 now we are talking magic soup,

25:17.780 --> 25:20.860
 but a big ball of connections like spaghetti,

25:20.860 --> 25:23.100
 very carefully structured with sparse connectivity

25:23.100 --> 25:25.760
 that preserves this deep hierarchical structure,

25:25.760 --> 25:28.300
 but all the action takes place on the surface,

25:28.300 --> 25:33.300
 on the cortex of the onion, and that means

25:34.180 --> 25:38.560
 that you have to supply the right amount of blood flow,

25:38.560 --> 25:41.100
 the right amount of nutrient,

25:41.100 --> 25:45.240
 which is rapidly absorbed and used by neural cells

25:45.240 --> 25:46.820
 that don't have the same capacity

25:46.820 --> 25:48.780
 that your leg muscles would have

25:48.780 --> 25:52.500
 to basically spend their energy budget

25:52.500 --> 25:55.000
 and then claim it back later.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.420
 So one peculiar thing about cerebral metabolism,

25:58.420 --> 26:01.440
 brain metabolism, is it really needs to be driven

26:01.440 --> 26:03.060
 in the moment, which means you basically

26:03.060 --> 26:04.860
 have to turn on the taps.

26:04.860 --> 26:08.700
 So if there's lots of neural activity

26:08.700 --> 26:10.780
 in one part of the brain, a little patch

26:10.780 --> 26:14.100
 of a few millimeters, even less possibly,

26:14.100 --> 26:16.060
 you really do have to water that piece

26:16.060 --> 26:18.420
 of the garden now and quickly,

26:18.420 --> 26:21.540
 and by quickly I mean within a couple of seconds.

26:21.540 --> 26:26.060
 So that contains a lot of, hence the imaging

26:26.060 --> 26:28.260
 could tell you a story of what's happening.

26:28.260 --> 26:32.240
 Absolutely, but it is slightly compromised

26:32.240 --> 26:33.460
 in terms of the resolution.

26:33.460 --> 26:37.580
 So the deployment of these little microvessels

26:37.580 --> 26:42.380
 that water the garden to enable the neural activity

26:42.380 --> 26:45.320
 to play out, the spatial resolution

26:45.320 --> 26:48.020
 is in order of a few millimeters,

26:48.020 --> 26:50.380
 and crucially, the temporal resolution

26:50.380 --> 26:52.220
 is the order of a few seconds.

26:52.220 --> 26:54.420
 So you can't get right down and dirty

26:54.420 --> 26:57.400
 into the actual spatial and temporal scale

26:57.400 --> 26:59.920
 of neural activity in and of itself.

26:59.920 --> 27:00.860
 To do that, you'd have to turn

27:00.860 --> 27:02.580
 to the other big imaging modality,

27:02.580 --> 27:05.580
 which is the recording of electromagnetic signals

27:05.580 --> 27:07.740
 as they're generated in real time.

27:07.740 --> 27:10.320
 So here, the temporal bandwidth, if you like,

27:10.320 --> 27:12.960
 or the low limit on the temporal resolution

27:12.960 --> 27:17.960
 is incredibly small, talking about milliseconds.

27:17.960 --> 27:22.960
 And then you can get into the phasic fast responses

27:23.520 --> 27:27.440
 that is in and of itself the neural activity,

27:27.440 --> 27:32.440
 and start to see the succession or cascade

27:32.780 --> 27:35.220
 of hierarchical recurrent message passing

27:35.220 --> 27:37.140
 evoked by a particular stimulus.

27:37.140 --> 27:39.400
 But the problem is you're looking

27:39.400 --> 27:42.440
 at electromagnetic signals that have passed

27:42.440 --> 27:45.640
 through an enormous amount of magic soup

27:45.640 --> 27:49.480
 or spaghetti of collectivity, and through the scalp

27:49.480 --> 27:52.920
 and the skull, and it's become spatially very diffuse.

27:52.920 --> 27:54.940
 So it's very difficult to know where you are.

27:54.940 --> 27:58.600
 So you've got this sort of catch 22.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.280
 You can either use an imaging modality

28:00.280 --> 28:02.840
 that tells you within millimeters

28:02.840 --> 28:04.440
 which part of the brain is activated,

28:04.440 --> 28:05.800
 but you don't know when,

28:05.800 --> 28:10.800
 or you've got these electromagnetic EEG, MEG setups

28:10.800 --> 28:15.800
 that tell you to within a few milliseconds

28:15.840 --> 28:19.240
 when something has responded, but you're not aware.

28:19.240 --> 28:22.520
 So you've got these two complementary measures,

28:22.520 --> 28:25.840
 either indirect via the blood flow,

28:25.840 --> 28:28.780
 or direct via the electromagnetic signals

28:28.780 --> 28:31.080
 caused by neural activity.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.360
 These are the two big imaging devices.

28:33.360 --> 28:36.960
 And then the second level of responding to your question,

28:36.960 --> 28:39.440
 what are the, from the outside,

28:39.440 --> 28:44.240
 what are the big ways of using this technology?

28:44.240 --> 28:47.160
 So once you've chosen the kind of neural imaging

28:47.160 --> 28:50.240
 that you want to use to answer your set questions,

28:50.240 --> 28:52.200
 and sometimes it would have to be both,

28:53.360 --> 28:57.540
 then you've got a whole raft of analyses,

28:57.540 --> 29:01.920
 time series analyses usually, that you can bring to bear

29:01.920 --> 29:04.360
 in order to answer your questions

29:04.360 --> 29:07.000
 or address your hypothesis about those data.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.920
 And interestingly, they both fall

29:08.920 --> 29:11.320
 into the same two camps we were talking about before,

29:11.320 --> 29:14.800
 this dialectic between specialization and integration,

29:14.800 --> 29:17.120
 differentiation and integration.

29:17.120 --> 29:20.880
 So it's the cartography, the blobology analyses.

29:20.880 --> 29:23.220
 I apologize, I probably shouldn't interrupt so much,

29:23.220 --> 29:27.080
 but just heard a fun word, the blah.

29:27.080 --> 29:27.920
 Blobology.

29:27.920 --> 29:29.160
 Blobology.

29:29.160 --> 29:33.000
 It's a neologism, which means the study of blobs.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.720
 So nothing bob.

29:34.720 --> 29:36.640
 Are you being witty and humorous,

29:36.640 --> 29:39.640
 or does the word blobology ever appear

29:39.640 --> 29:40.760
 in a textbook somewhere?

29:40.760 --> 29:43.320
 It would appear in a popular book.

29:43.320 --> 29:47.960
 It would not appear in a worthy specialist journal.

29:47.960 --> 29:48.960
 Yeah, I thought so.

29:48.960 --> 29:53.560
 It's the fond word for the study of literally little blobs

29:53.560 --> 29:56.160
 on brain maps showing activations.

29:56.160 --> 29:59.500
 So the kind of thing that you'd see in the newspapers

29:59.500 --> 30:04.080
 on ABC or BBC reporting the latest finding

30:04.080 --> 30:05.320
 from brain imaging.

30:05.320 --> 30:10.080
 Interestingly though, the maths involved

30:10.080 --> 30:15.080
 in that stream of analysis does actually call upon

30:15.340 --> 30:17.640
 the mathematics of blobs.

30:17.640 --> 30:21.800
 So seriously, they're actually called Euler characteristics

30:21.800 --> 30:26.800
 and they have a lot of fancy names in mathematics.

30:27.500 --> 30:28.920
 We'll talk about it, about your ideas

30:28.920 --> 30:30.400
 in free energy principle.

30:30.400 --> 30:33.320
 I mean, there's echoes of blobs there

30:33.320 --> 30:36.720
 when you consider sort of entities,

30:36.720 --> 30:38.000
 mathematically speaking.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.400
 Yes, absolutely.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.080
 Well, circumscribed, well defined,

30:43.080 --> 30:48.080
 you entities of, well, from the free energy point of view,

30:48.120 --> 30:50.280
 entities of anything, but from the point of view

30:50.280 --> 30:55.280
 of the analysis, the cartography of the brain,

30:55.800 --> 30:59.200
 these are the entities that constitute the evidence

30:59.200 --> 31:01.680
 for this functional segregation.

31:01.680 --> 31:04.500
 You have segregated this function in this blob

31:04.500 --> 31:06.760
 and it is not outside of the blob.

31:06.760 --> 31:10.200
 And that's basically the, if you were a map maker

31:10.200 --> 31:14.080
 of America and you did not know its structure,

31:14.080 --> 31:16.400
 the first thing were you doing constituting

31:16.400 --> 31:19.140
 or creating a map would be to identify the cities,

31:19.140 --> 31:22.000
 for example, or the mountains or the rivers.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.920
 All of these uniquely spatially localizable features,

31:26.920 --> 31:30.680
 possibly topological features have to be placed somewhere

31:30.680 --> 31:33.520
 because that requires a mathematics of identifying

31:33.520 --> 31:36.080
 what does a city look like on a satellite image

31:36.080 --> 31:37.400
 or what does a river look like

31:37.400 --> 31:39.120
 or what does a mountain look like?

31:39.120 --> 31:42.240
 What would it, you know, what data features

31:42.240 --> 31:46.520
 would evidence that particular top,

31:46.520 --> 31:48.560
 you know, that particular thing

31:48.560 --> 31:50.400
 that you wanted to put on the map?

31:50.400 --> 31:52.760
 And they normally are characterized

31:52.760 --> 31:54.320
 in terms of literally these blobs

31:54.320 --> 31:57.000
 or these sort of, another way of looking at this

31:57.000 --> 32:01.560
 is that a certain statistical measure

32:01.560 --> 32:04.000
 of the degree of activation crosses a threshold

32:04.000 --> 32:06.520
 and in crossing that threshold

32:06.520 --> 32:09.600
 in the spatially restricted part of the brain,

32:09.600 --> 32:11.040
 it creates a blob.

32:11.040 --> 32:14.000
 And that's basically what statistical parametric mapping does.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.580
 It's basically mathematically finessed blobology.

32:19.840 --> 32:20.920
 Okay, so those are the,

32:20.920 --> 32:24.000
 you kind of described these two methodologies for,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.920
 one is temporally noisy, one is spatially noisy

32:26.920 --> 32:28.360
 and you kind of have to play and figure out

32:28.360 --> 32:30.060
 what can be useful.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.000
 It'd be great if you can sort of comment.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.920
 I got a chance recently to spend a day

32:34.920 --> 32:37.200
 at a company called Neuralink

32:37.200 --> 32:39.420
 that uses brain computer interfaces

32:39.420 --> 32:42.720
 and their dream is to, well,

32:42.720 --> 32:45.200
 there's a bunch of sort of dreams,

32:45.200 --> 32:47.380
 but one of them is to understand the brain

32:47.380 --> 32:51.520
 by sort of, you know, getting in there

32:51.520 --> 32:53.800
 past the so called sort of factory wall,

32:53.800 --> 32:55.200
 getting in there and be able to listen,

32:55.200 --> 32:57.160
 communicate both directions.

32:57.160 --> 32:59.360
 What are your thoughts about this,

32:59.360 --> 33:01.040
 the future of this kind of technology

33:01.040 --> 33:02.360
 of brain computer interfaces

33:02.360 --> 33:06.920
 to be able to now have a window

33:06.920 --> 33:08.500
 or direct contact within the brain

33:08.500 --> 33:10.040
 to be able to measure some of the signals,

33:10.040 --> 33:11.320
 to be able to sense signals,

33:11.320 --> 33:15.040
 to understand some of the functionality of the brain?

33:15.040 --> 33:17.760
 Ambivalent, my sense is ambivalent.

33:17.760 --> 33:19.920
 So it's a mixture of good and bad

33:19.920 --> 33:21.420
 and I acknowledge that freely.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.760
 So the good bits, if you just look at the legacy

33:24.760 --> 33:29.240
 of that kind of reciprocal but invasive

33:29.240 --> 33:31.160
 your brain stimulation,

33:31.160 --> 33:33.160
 I didn't paint a complete picture

33:33.160 --> 33:34.680
 when I was talking about sort of the ways

33:34.680 --> 33:37.080
 we understand the brain prior to neuroimaging.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.680
 It wasn't just lesion deficit studies.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.380
 Some of the early work, in fact,

33:41.380 --> 33:43.500
 literally 100 years from where we're sitting

33:43.500 --> 33:45.240
 at the institution of neurology,

33:45.240 --> 33:50.000
 was done by stimulating the brain of say dogs

33:50.000 --> 33:51.880
 and looking at how they responded

33:51.880 --> 33:56.400
 with their muscles or with their salivation

33:56.400 --> 34:00.920
 and imputing what that part of the brain must be doing.

34:00.920 --> 34:05.920
 If I stimulate it and I vote this kind of response,

34:06.000 --> 34:07.240
 then that tells me quite a lot

34:07.240 --> 34:09.080
 about the functional specialization.

34:09.080 --> 34:12.280
 So there's a long history of brain stimulation

34:12.280 --> 34:16.840
 which continues to enjoy a lot of attention nowadays.

34:16.840 --> 34:17.720
 Positive attention.

34:17.720 --> 34:19.600
 Oh yes, absolutely.

34:19.600 --> 34:22.160
 You know, deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease

34:22.160 --> 34:23.600
 is now a standard treatment

34:23.600 --> 34:25.560
 and also a wonderful vehicle

34:25.560 --> 34:29.000
 to try and understand the neuronal dynamics

34:29.000 --> 34:31.960
 underlying movement disorders like Parkinson's disease.

34:33.120 --> 34:37.920
 Even interest in magnetic stimulation,

34:37.920 --> 34:39.240
 stimulating the magnetic fields

34:39.240 --> 34:43.320
 and will it work in people who are depressed, for example.

34:43.320 --> 34:45.700
 Quite a crude level of understanding what you're doing,

34:45.700 --> 34:49.080
 but there is historical evidence

34:49.080 --> 34:51.800
 that these kinds of brute force interventions

34:51.800 --> 34:53.380
 do change things.

34:53.380 --> 34:56.000
 They, you know, it's a little bit like banging the TV

34:56.000 --> 34:58.240
 when the valves aren't working properly,

34:58.240 --> 35:00.720
 but it's still, it works.

35:00.720 --> 35:04.480
 So, you know, there is a long history.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.820
 Brain computer interfacing or BCI,

35:08.700 --> 35:11.000
 I think is a beautiful example of that.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.720
 It's sort of carved out its own niche

35:12.720 --> 35:14.420
 and its own aspirations

35:14.420 --> 35:19.420
 and there've been enormous advances within limits.

35:20.800 --> 35:23.960
 Advances in terms of our ability to understand

35:25.480 --> 35:28.740
 how the brain, the embodied brain,

35:29.720 --> 35:31.520
 engages with the world.

35:32.480 --> 35:34.760
 I'm thinking here of sensory substitution,

35:34.760 --> 35:37.240
 the augmenting our sensory capacities

35:37.240 --> 35:40.820
 by giving ourselves extra ways of sensing

35:40.820 --> 35:42.260
 and sampling the world,

35:42.260 --> 35:47.260
 ranging from sort of trying to replace lost visual signals

35:48.300 --> 35:50.380
 through to giving people completely new signals.

35:50.380 --> 35:55.380
 So, one of the, I think, most engaging examples of this

35:57.100 --> 36:00.660
 is equipping people with a sense of magnetic fields.

36:00.660 --> 36:03.620
 So you can actually give them magnetic sensors

36:03.620 --> 36:05.460
 that enable them to feel,

36:05.460 --> 36:08.980
 should we say, tactile pressure around their tummy,

36:08.980 --> 36:13.100
 where they are in relation to the magnetic field of the Earth.

36:13.100 --> 36:17.660
 And after a few weeks, they take it for granted.

36:17.660 --> 36:19.340
 They integrate it, they embody this,

36:19.340 --> 36:22.340
 simulate this new sensory information

36:22.340 --> 36:25.420
 into the way that they literally feel their world,

36:25.420 --> 36:29.300
 but now equipped with this sense of magnetic direction.

36:29.300 --> 36:31.020
 So that tells you something

36:31.020 --> 36:32.980
 about the brain's plastic potential

36:32.980 --> 36:37.980
 to remodel and its plastic capacity

36:37.980 --> 36:42.980
 to suddenly try to explain the sensory data at hand

36:43.640 --> 36:48.440
 by augmenting the sensory sphere

36:48.440 --> 36:50.680
 and the kinds of things that you can measure.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.720
 Clearly, that's purely for entertainment

36:54.720 --> 36:58.800
 and understanding the nature and the power of our brains.

37:00.120 --> 37:03.400
 I would imagine that most BCI is pitched

37:03.400 --> 37:08.400
 at solving clinical and human problems

37:08.600 --> 37:12.240
 such as locked in syndrome, such as paraplegia,

37:12.240 --> 37:16.120
 or replacing lost sensory capacities

37:16.120 --> 37:18.960
 like blindness and deafness.

37:18.960 --> 37:23.960
 So then we come to the negative part of my ambivalence,

37:24.240 --> 37:25.480
 the other side of it.

37:26.960 --> 37:30.960
 So I don't want to be deflationary

37:30.960 --> 37:33.400
 because much of my deflationary comments

37:33.400 --> 37:37.120
 is probably large out of ignorance than anything else.

37:37.120 --> 37:42.120
 But generally speaking, the bandwidth

37:42.480 --> 37:44.360
 and the bit rates that you get

37:44.360 --> 37:49.160
 from brain computer interfaces as we currently know them,

37:49.160 --> 37:51.460
 we're talking about bits per second.

37:51.460 --> 37:55.600
 So that would be like me only being able to communicate

37:55.600 --> 38:00.600
 with any world or with you using very, very, very slow Morse code.

38:06.560 --> 38:11.560
 And it is not even within an order of magnitude

38:13.440 --> 38:18.440
 near what we actually need for an inactive realization

38:18.600 --> 38:21.280
 of what people aspire to when they think about

38:21.280 --> 38:26.280
 sort of curing people with paraplegia or replacing sight

38:28.760 --> 38:30.280
 despite heroic efforts.

38:30.280 --> 38:33.760
 So one has to ask, is there a lower bound

38:33.760 --> 38:38.760
 on the kinds of recurrent information exchange

38:41.040 --> 38:46.040
 between a brain and some augmented or artificial interface?

38:46.040 --> 38:51.040
 And then we come back to, interestingly,

38:51.620 --> 38:52.820
 what I was talking about before,

38:52.820 --> 38:56.460
 which is if you're talking about function

38:56.460 --> 39:00.220
 in terms of inference, and I presume we'll get to that

39:00.220 --> 39:01.900
 later on in terms of the free energy principle,

39:01.900 --> 39:05.140
 then at the moment, there may be fundamental reasons

39:05.140 --> 39:06.400
 to assume that is the case.

39:06.400 --> 39:08.540
 We're talking about ensemble activity.

39:08.540 --> 39:13.540
 We're talking about basically, for example,

39:13.540 --> 39:18.540
 let's paint the challenge facing brain computer interfacing

39:20.800 --> 39:24.520
 in terms of controlling another system

39:24.520 --> 39:27.080
 that is highly and deeply structured,

39:27.080 --> 39:30.560
 very relevant to our lives, very nonlinear,

39:30.560 --> 39:34.360
 that rests upon the kind of nonequilibrium

39:34.360 --> 39:37.400
 steady states and dynamics that the brain does,

39:37.400 --> 39:39.540
 the weather, all right?

39:39.540 --> 39:44.540
 So imagine you had some very aggressive satellites

39:45.840 --> 39:48.280
 that could produce signals that could perturb

39:48.280 --> 39:53.000
 some little parts of the weather system.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.140
 And then what you're asking now is,

39:55.140 --> 39:58.320
 can I meaningfully get into the weather

39:58.320 --> 40:01.300
 and change it meaningfully and make the weather respond

40:01.300 --> 40:03.360
 in a way that I want it to?

40:03.360 --> 40:06.600
 You're talking about chaos control on a scale

40:06.600 --> 40:08.860
 which is almost unimaginable.

40:08.860 --> 40:11.120
 So there may be fundamental reasons

40:11.120 --> 40:16.120
 why BCI, as you might read about it in a science fiction novel,

40:18.480 --> 40:22.920
 aspirational BCI may never actually work

40:22.920 --> 40:26.920
 in the sense that to really be integrated

40:26.920 --> 40:31.920
 and be part of the system is a requirement

40:32.160 --> 40:35.240
 that requires you to have evolved with that system,

40:35.240 --> 40:40.240
 that you have to be part of a very delicately structured,

40:43.320 --> 40:48.000
 deeply structured, dynamic, ensemble activity

40:48.000 --> 40:51.600
 that is not like rewiring a broken computer

40:51.600 --> 40:54.660
 or plugging in a peripheral interface adapter.

40:54.660 --> 40:58.140
 It is much more like getting into the weather patterns

40:58.140 --> 41:00.680
 or, come back to your magic soup,

41:00.680 --> 41:02.420
 getting into the active matter

41:02.420 --> 41:07.140
 and meaningfully relate that to the outside world.

41:07.140 --> 41:09.920
 So I think there are enormous challenges there.

41:09.920 --> 41:13.260
 So I think the example of the weather is a brilliant one.

41:13.260 --> 41:15.300
 And I think you paint a really interesting picture

41:15.300 --> 41:17.420
 and it wasn't as negative as I thought.

41:17.420 --> 41:19.920
 It's essentially saying that it might be

41:19.920 --> 41:22.140
 incredibly challenging, including the low bound

41:22.140 --> 41:23.640
 of the bandwidth and so on.

41:23.640 --> 41:26.900
 I kind of, so just to full disclosure,

41:26.900 --> 41:28.680
 I come from the machine learning world.

41:28.680 --> 41:32.760
 So my natural thought is the hardest part

41:32.760 --> 41:34.820
 is the engineering challenge of controlling the weather,

41:34.820 --> 41:37.560
 of getting those satellites up and running and so on.

41:37.560 --> 41:42.220
 And once they are, then the rest is fundamentally

41:42.220 --> 41:46.860
 the same approaches that allow you to win in the game of Go

41:46.860 --> 41:49.580
 will allow you to potentially play in this soup,

41:49.580 --> 41:51.000
 in this chaos.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.500
 So I have a hope that sort of machine learning methods

41:54.500 --> 41:58.820
 will help us play in this soup.

41:58.820 --> 42:03.820
 But perhaps you're right that it is a biology

42:04.220 --> 42:08.660
 and the brain is just an incredible system

42:08.660 --> 42:12.220
 that may be almost impossible to get in.

42:12.220 --> 42:15.780
 But for me, what seems impossible

42:15.780 --> 42:19.780
 is the incredible mess of blood vessels

42:19.780 --> 42:22.300
 that you also described without,

42:22.300 --> 42:24.620
 we also value the brain.

42:24.620 --> 42:27.100
 You can't make any mistakes, you can't damage things.

42:27.100 --> 42:31.340
 So to me, that engineering challenge seems nearly impossible.

42:31.340 --> 42:35.900
 One of the things I was really impressed by at Neuralink

42:35.900 --> 42:39.660
 is just talking to brilliant neurosurgeons

42:39.660 --> 42:43.340
 and the roboticists that made me realize

42:43.340 --> 42:45.860
 that even though it seems impossible,

42:45.860 --> 42:48.620
 if anyone can do it, it's some of these world class

42:48.620 --> 42:50.800
 engineers that are trying to take it on.

42:50.800 --> 42:55.800
 So I think the conclusion of our discussion here

42:55.860 --> 43:00.860
 of this part is basically that the problem is really hard

43:00.980 --> 43:02.580
 but hopefully not impossible.

43:02.580 --> 43:03.800
 Absolutely.

43:03.800 --> 43:07.260
 So if it's okay, let's start with the basics.

43:07.260 --> 43:12.180
 So you've also formulated a fascinating principle,

43:12.180 --> 43:13.500
 the free energy principle.

43:13.500 --> 43:15.340
 Could we maybe start at the basics

43:15.340 --> 43:19.660
 and what is the free energy principle?

43:19.660 --> 43:22.260
 Well, in fact, the free energy principle

43:23.700 --> 43:28.700
 inherits a lot from the building

43:29.220 --> 43:31.240
 of these data analytic approaches

43:31.240 --> 43:34.180
 to these very high dimensional time series

43:34.180 --> 43:35.960
 you get from the brain.

43:35.960 --> 43:37.940
 So I think it's interesting to acknowledge that.

43:37.940 --> 43:39.980
 And in particular, the analysis tools

43:39.980 --> 43:43.100
 that try to address the other side,

43:43.100 --> 43:44.360
 which is a functional integration,

43:44.360 --> 43:46.060
 so the connectivity analyses.

43:46.060 --> 43:51.060
 So on the one hand, but I should also acknowledge

43:51.920 --> 43:55.360
 it inherits an awful lot from machine learning as well.

43:55.360 --> 44:00.360
 So the free energy principle is just a formal statement

44:02.600 --> 44:07.600
 that the existential imperatives for any system

44:08.500 --> 44:11.380
 that manages to survive in a changing world

44:11.380 --> 44:16.380
 can be cast as an inference problem

44:18.900 --> 44:21.240
 in the sense that you can interpret

44:21.240 --> 44:25.720
 the probability of existing as the evidence that you exist.

44:25.720 --> 44:29.460
 And if you can write down that problem of existence

44:29.460 --> 44:30.900
 as a statistical problem,

44:30.900 --> 44:33.940
 then you can use all the maths that has been developed

44:33.940 --> 44:38.940
 for inference to understand and characterize

44:38.940 --> 44:42.960
 the ensemble dynamics that must be in play

44:42.960 --> 44:45.560
 in the service of that inference.

44:45.560 --> 44:48.240
 So technically, what that means is

44:48.240 --> 44:51.160
 you can always interpret anything that exists

44:52.160 --> 44:55.660
 in virtue of being separate from the environment

44:55.660 --> 45:00.660
 in which it exists as trying to minimize

45:02.100 --> 45:03.600
 variational free energy.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.560
 And if you're from the machine learning community,

45:05.560 --> 45:09.200
 you will know that as a negative evidence lower bound

45:09.200 --> 45:13.120
 or a negative elbow, which is the same as saying

45:13.120 --> 45:16.400
 you're trying to maximize or it will look as if

45:16.400 --> 45:19.720
 all your dynamics are trying to maximize

45:19.720 --> 45:24.000
 the complement of that which is the marginal likelihood

45:24.000 --> 45:26.480
 or the evidence for your own existence.

45:26.480 --> 45:30.120
 So that's basically the free energy principle.

45:30.120 --> 45:34.120
 But to even take a sort of a small step backwards,

45:34.120 --> 45:37.120
 you said the existential imperative.

45:38.360 --> 45:40.120
 There's a lot of beautiful poetic words here,

45:40.120 --> 45:45.120
 but to put it crudely, it's a fascinating idea

45:46.840 --> 45:49.520
 of basically just of trying to describe

45:49.520 --> 45:51.800
 if you're looking at a blob,

45:51.800 --> 45:54.320
 how do you know this thing is alive?

45:54.320 --> 45:55.680
 What does it mean to be alive?

45:55.680 --> 45:57.520
 What does it mean to exist?

45:57.520 --> 45:59.440
 And so you can look at the brain,

45:59.440 --> 46:00.720
 you can look at parts of the brain,

46:00.720 --> 46:02.840
 or this is just a general principle

46:02.840 --> 46:07.240
 that applies to almost any system.

46:07.240 --> 46:10.160
 That's just a fascinating sort of philosophically

46:10.160 --> 46:13.120
 at every level question and a methodology

46:13.120 --> 46:14.360
 to try to answer that question.

46:14.360 --> 46:16.040
 What does it mean to be alive?

46:16.040 --> 46:21.040
 So that's a huge endeavor and it's nice

46:21.480 --> 46:23.200
 that there's at least some,

46:23.200 --> 46:25.480
 from some perspective, a clean answer.

46:25.480 --> 46:30.280
 So maybe can you talk about that optimization view of it?

46:30.280 --> 46:33.520
 So what's trying to be minimized, maximized?

46:33.520 --> 46:36.840
 A system that's alive, what is it trying to minimize?

46:36.840 --> 46:39.360
 Right, you've made a big move there.

46:40.600 --> 46:44.000
 First of all, it's good to make big moves.

46:45.960 --> 46:50.960
 But you've assumed that the thing exists

46:52.000 --> 46:54.680
 in a state that could be living or nonliving.

46:54.680 --> 46:57.960
 So I may ask you, what licenses you

46:57.960 --> 47:00.120
 to say that something exists?

47:00.120 --> 47:02.280
 That's why I use the word existential.

47:02.280 --> 47:05.440
 It's beyond living, it's just existence.

47:05.440 --> 47:08.000
 So if you drill down onto the definition

47:08.000 --> 47:13.000
 of things that exist, then they have certain properties

47:13.520 --> 47:16.400
 if you borrow the maths

47:16.400 --> 47:19.360
 from nonequilibrium steady state physics

47:19.360 --> 47:24.360
 that enable you to interpret their existence

47:26.240 --> 47:29.280
 in terms of this optimization procedure.

47:29.280 --> 47:32.160
 So it's good you introduced the word optimization.

47:32.160 --> 47:36.000
 So what the free energy principle

47:36.000 --> 47:39.800
 in its sort of most ambitious,

47:39.800 --> 47:44.720
 but also most deflationary and simplest, says

47:44.720 --> 47:47.200
 is that if something exists,

47:47.200 --> 47:51.440
 then it must, by the mathematics

47:51.440 --> 47:55.120
 of nonequilibrium steady state,

47:55.120 --> 47:59.600
 exhibit properties that make it look

47:59.600 --> 48:03.680
 as if it is optimizing a particular quantity.

48:03.680 --> 48:06.120
 And it turns out that particular quantity

48:06.120 --> 48:08.520
 happens to be exactly the same

48:08.520 --> 48:11.360
 as the evidence lower bound in machine learning

48:11.360 --> 48:15.280
 or Bayesian model evidence in Bayesian statistics.

48:15.280 --> 48:18.800
 Or, and then I can list a whole other list

48:18.800 --> 48:23.480
 of ways of understanding this key quantity,

48:23.480 --> 48:28.480
 which is a bound on surprise or self information

48:29.120 --> 48:31.000
 if you have information theory.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.080
 There are a number of different perspectives

48:34.080 --> 48:34.920
 on this quantity.

48:34.920 --> 48:36.920
 It's just basically the log probability

48:36.920 --> 48:40.120
 of being in a particular state.

48:40.120 --> 48:42.840
 I'm telling this story as an honest,

48:42.840 --> 48:44.560
 an attempt to answer your question.

48:45.640 --> 48:49.280
 And I'm answering it as if I was pretending

48:49.280 --> 48:52.400
 to be a physicist who was trying to understand

48:52.400 --> 48:57.120
 the fundaments of nonequilibrium steady state.

48:58.040 --> 48:59.640
 And I shouldn't really be doing that

48:59.640 --> 49:02.240
 because the last time I was taught physics,

49:02.240 --> 49:03.760
 I was in my 20s.

49:03.760 --> 49:04.720
 What kind of systems,

49:04.720 --> 49:06.400
 when you think about the free energy principle,

49:06.400 --> 49:08.640
 what kind of systems are you imagining

49:08.640 --> 49:11.640
 as a sort of more specific kind of case study?

49:11.640 --> 49:15.720
 Yeah, I'm imagining a range of systems,

49:15.720 --> 49:22.720
 but at its simplest, a single celled organism

49:23.400 --> 49:26.120
 that can be identified from its eco niche

49:26.120 --> 49:27.680
 or its environment.

49:27.680 --> 49:31.480
 So at its simplest, that's basically

49:31.480 --> 49:33.840
 what I always imagined in my head.

49:33.840 --> 49:36.680
 And you may ask, well, is there any,

49:36.680 --> 49:41.680
 how on earth can you even elaborate questions

49:41.680 --> 49:46.680
 about the existence of a single drop of oil, for example?

49:48.000 --> 49:49.440
 But there are deep questions there.

49:49.440 --> 49:52.560
 Why doesn't the oil, why doesn't the thing,

49:52.560 --> 49:55.160
 the interface between the drop of oil

49:55.160 --> 49:57.480
 that contains an interior

49:57.480 --> 50:00.320
 and the thing that is not the drop of oil,

50:00.320 --> 50:03.880
 which is the solvent in which it is immersed,

50:03.880 --> 50:07.080
 how does that interface persist over time?

50:07.080 --> 50:10.400
 Why doesn't the oil just dissolve into solvent?

50:10.400 --> 50:16.160
 So what special properties of the exchange

50:16.160 --> 50:18.200
 between the surface of the oil drop

50:18.200 --> 50:22.000
 and the external states in which it's immersed,

50:22.000 --> 50:24.040
 if you're a physicist, say it would be the heat bath.

50:24.040 --> 50:28.280
 You've got a physical system, an ensemble again,

50:28.280 --> 50:30.320
 we're talking about density dynamics, ensemble dynamics,

50:30.320 --> 50:35.840
 an ensemble of atoms or molecules immersed in the heat bath.

50:35.840 --> 50:38.760
 But the question is, how did the heat bath get there?

50:38.760 --> 50:41.360
 And why does it not dissolve?

50:41.360 --> 50:42.800
 How is it maintaining itself?

50:42.800 --> 50:43.640
 Exactly.

50:43.640 --> 50:44.480
 What actions is it?

50:44.480 --> 50:47.520
 I mean, it's such a fascinating idea of a drop of oil

50:47.520 --> 50:50.000
 and I guess it would dissolve in water,

50:50.000 --> 50:51.680
 it wouldn't dissolve in water.

50:51.680 --> 50:52.520
 So what?

50:52.520 --> 50:53.840
 Precisely, so why not?

50:53.840 --> 50:54.680
 So why not?

50:54.680 --> 50:55.520
 Why not?

50:55.520 --> 50:57.000
 And how do you mathematically describe,

50:57.000 --> 50:58.680
 I mean, it's such a beautiful idea.

50:58.680 --> 51:02.120
 And also the idea of like, where does the thing,

51:02.120 --> 51:07.120
 where does the drop of oil end and where does it begin?

51:07.120 --> 51:10.400
 Right, so I mean, you're asking deep questions,

51:10.400 --> 51:12.520
 deep in a nonmillennial sense here.

51:12.520 --> 51:16.280
 In a hierarchical sense.

51:16.280 --> 51:21.280
 But what you can do, so this is the deflationary part of it.

51:21.720 --> 51:23.920
 Can I just qualify my answer by saying that normally

51:23.920 --> 51:24.760
 when I'm asked this question,

51:24.760 --> 51:26.640
 I answer from the point of view of a psychologist,

51:26.640 --> 51:29.080
 we talk about predictive processing and predictive coding

51:29.080 --> 51:31.640
 and the brain as an inference machine,

51:31.640 --> 51:33.920
 but you haven't asked me from that perspective,

51:33.920 --> 51:36.240
 I'm answering from the point of view of a physicist.

51:36.240 --> 51:41.000
 So the question is not so much why,

51:41.000 --> 51:44.440
 but if it exists, what properties must it display?

51:44.440 --> 51:46.880
 So that's the deflationary part of the free energy principle.

51:46.880 --> 51:50.800
 The free energy principle does not supply an answer

51:50.800 --> 51:54.520
 as to why, it's saying if something exists,

51:54.520 --> 51:57.720
 then it must display these properties.

51:57.720 --> 52:01.560
 That's the sort of thing that's on offer.

52:01.560 --> 52:05.240
 And it so happens that these properties it must display

52:05.240 --> 52:10.240
 are actually intriguing and have this inferential gloss,

52:10.880 --> 52:14.920
 this sort of self evidencing gloss that inherits on the fact

52:14.920 --> 52:19.720
 that the very preservation of the boundary

52:19.720 --> 52:22.640
 between the oil drop and the not oil drop

52:22.640 --> 52:26.160
 requires an optimization of a particular function

52:26.160 --> 52:30.600
 or a functional that defines the presence

52:30.600 --> 52:33.040
 or the existence of this oil drop,

52:33.040 --> 52:36.160
 which is why I started with existential imperatives.

52:36.160 --> 52:39.520
 It is a necessary condition for existence

52:39.520 --> 52:42.880
 that this must occur because the boundary

52:42.880 --> 52:46.040
 basically defines the thing that's existing.

52:46.040 --> 52:47.960
 So it is that self assembly aspect

52:47.960 --> 52:53.080
 it's that you were hinting at in biology,

52:53.080 --> 52:55.720
 sometimes known as autopoiesis

52:56.880 --> 53:00.160
 in computational chemistry with self assembly.

53:00.160 --> 53:03.600
 It's the, what does it look like?

53:03.600 --> 53:06.040
 Sorry, how would you describe things

53:06.040 --> 53:08.640
 that configure themselves out of nothing?

53:08.640 --> 53:12.000
 The way they clearly demarcate themselves

53:12.000 --> 53:16.680
 from the states or the soup in which they are immersed.

53:18.240 --> 53:20.920
 So from the point of view of computational chemistry,

53:20.920 --> 53:23.440
 for example, you would just understand that

53:23.440 --> 53:25.440
 as a configuration of a macro molecule

53:25.440 --> 53:28.920
 to minimize its free energy, its thermodynamic free energy.

53:28.920 --> 53:31.480
 It's exactly the same principle that we've been talking about

53:31.480 --> 53:35.040
 that thermodynamic free energy is just the negative elbow.

53:35.040 --> 53:38.200
 It's the same mathematical construct.

53:38.200 --> 53:42.520
 So the very emergence of existence, of structure, of form

53:42.520 --> 53:45.040
 that can be distinguished from the environment

53:45.040 --> 53:47.280
 or the thing that is not the thing

53:49.240 --> 53:54.240
 necessitates the existence of an objective function

53:56.120 --> 53:58.160
 that it looks as if it is minimizing.

53:58.160 --> 54:00.280
 It's finding a free energy minima.

54:00.280 --> 54:04.880
 And so just to clarify, I'm trying to wrap my head around.

54:04.880 --> 54:09.560
 So the free energy principle says that if something exists,

54:09.560 --> 54:11.520
 these are the properties it should display.

54:11.520 --> 54:12.520
 Yeah.

54:12.520 --> 54:17.520
 So what that means is we can't just look,

54:17.520 --> 54:21.320
 we can't just go into a soup and there's no mechanism.

54:21.320 --> 54:23.480
 Free energy principle doesn't give us a mechanism

54:23.480 --> 54:25.680
 to find the things that exist.

54:25.680 --> 54:28.680
 Is that what's implying, is being implied

54:28.680 --> 54:33.200
 that you can kind of use it to reason,

54:33.200 --> 54:36.040
 to think about like, study a particular system

54:36.040 --> 54:39.120
 and say, does this exhibit these qualities?

54:40.600 --> 54:42.400
 That's an excellent question.

54:42.400 --> 54:44.680
 But to answer that, I'd have to return

54:44.680 --> 54:46.240
 to your previous question about what's the difference

54:46.240 --> 54:48.520
 between living and nonliving things.

54:48.520 --> 54:51.880
 Yes, well, actually, sorry.

54:51.880 --> 54:54.080
 So yeah, maybe we can go there.

54:54.080 --> 54:57.160
 Maybe we can go there, you kind of drew a line

54:57.160 --> 54:58.960
 and forgive me for the stupid questions,

54:58.960 --> 55:02.560
 but you kind of drew a line between living and existing.

55:02.560 --> 55:07.200
 Is there an interesting sort of distinction?

55:07.200 --> 55:08.760
 Yeah, I think there is.

55:09.600 --> 55:14.600
 So things do exist, grains of sand,

55:15.240 --> 55:19.480
 rocks on the moon, trees, you.

55:19.480 --> 55:24.480
 So all of these things can be separated from the environment

55:24.960 --> 55:26.320
 in which they are immersed.

55:26.320 --> 55:28.200
 And therefore, they must at some level

55:28.200 --> 55:31.320
 be optimizing their free energy,

55:32.320 --> 55:36.200
 taking this sort of model evidence interpretation

55:36.200 --> 55:38.160
 of this quantity that basically means

55:38.160 --> 55:39.640
 they're self evidencing.

55:39.640 --> 55:42.840
 Another nice little twist of phrase here

55:42.840 --> 55:45.520
 is that you are your own existence proof,

55:45.520 --> 55:48.880
 statistically speaking, which I don't think

55:48.880 --> 55:51.800
 I said that, somebody did, but I love that phrase.

55:53.480 --> 55:55.600
 You are your own existence proof.

55:55.600 --> 55:58.040
 Yeah, so it's so existential, isn't it?

55:59.280 --> 56:01.440
 I'm gonna have to think about that for a few days.

56:01.440 --> 56:06.080
 That's a beautiful line.

56:06.080 --> 56:09.760
 So the step through to answer your question

56:09.760 --> 56:11.560
 about what's it good for,

56:13.840 --> 56:15.760
 we'll go along the following lines.

56:15.760 --> 56:18.720
 First of all, you have to define what it means

56:18.720 --> 56:22.040
 to exist, which now, as you've rightly pointed out,

56:22.040 --> 56:25.000
 you have to define what probabilistic properties

56:25.000 --> 56:27.440
 must the states of something possess

56:27.440 --> 56:30.600
 so it knows where it finishes.

56:30.600 --> 56:32.720
 And then you write that down in terms

56:32.720 --> 56:36.000
 of statistical dependencies, again, sparsity.

56:36.000 --> 56:39.680
 Again, it's not what's connected or what's correlated

56:39.680 --> 56:43.720
 or what depends upon, it's what's not correlated

56:43.720 --> 56:45.960
 and what doesn't depend upon something.

56:45.960 --> 56:49.680
 Again, it comes down to the deep structures,

56:49.680 --> 56:50.920
 not in this instance, hierarchical,

56:50.920 --> 56:54.040
 but the structures that emerge

56:54.040 --> 56:56.920
 from removing connectivity and dependency.

56:56.920 --> 57:00.160
 And in this instance, basically being able

57:00.160 --> 57:02.720
 to identify the surface of the oil drop

57:02.720 --> 57:06.480
 from the water in which it is immersed.

57:06.480 --> 57:09.120
 And when you do that, you start to realize,

57:09.120 --> 57:12.720
 well, there are actually four kinds of states

57:12.720 --> 57:15.680
 in any given universe that contains anything.

57:15.680 --> 57:18.840
 The things that are internal to the surface,

57:18.840 --> 57:20.680
 the things that are external to the surface

57:20.680 --> 57:22.560
 and the surface in and of itself,

57:22.560 --> 57:24.040
 which is why I use a metaphor,

57:24.040 --> 57:25.440
 a little single celled organism

57:25.440 --> 57:27.080
 that has an interior and exterior

57:27.080 --> 57:29.520
 and then the surface of the cell.

57:29.520 --> 57:32.720
 And that's mathematically a Markov blanket.

57:32.720 --> 57:34.960
 Just to pause, I'm in awe of this concept

57:34.960 --> 57:36.560
 that there's the stuff outside the surface,

57:36.560 --> 57:38.960
 stuff inside the surface and the surface itself,

57:38.960 --> 57:40.240
 the Markov blanket.

57:40.240 --> 57:43.680
 It's just the most beautiful kind of notion

57:43.680 --> 57:46.160
 about trying to explore what it means

57:46.160 --> 57:48.240
 to exist mathematically.

57:48.240 --> 57:50.720
 I apologize, it's just a beautiful idea.

57:50.720 --> 57:53.080
 But it came out of California, so that's.

57:53.080 --> 57:54.000
 I changed my mind.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.080
 I take it all back.

57:55.080 --> 57:59.440
 So anyway, so you were just talking

57:59.440 --> 58:01.280
 about the surface, about the Markov blanket.

58:01.280 --> 58:04.680
 So this surface or these blanket states

58:04.680 --> 58:09.680
 that are the, because they are now defined

58:09.680 --> 58:14.680
 in relation to these independencies

58:17.560 --> 58:21.560
 and what different states internal blanket

58:21.560 --> 58:23.840
 or external states can,

58:23.840 --> 58:25.280
 which ones can influence each other

58:25.280 --> 58:27.760
 and which cannot influence each other.

58:27.760 --> 58:30.960
 You can now apply standard results

58:30.960 --> 58:33.600
 that you would find in non equilibrium physics

58:33.600 --> 58:37.880
 or steady state or thermodynamics or hydrodynamics,

58:37.880 --> 58:41.640
 usually out of equilibrium solutions

58:41.640 --> 58:43.200
 and apply them to this partition.

58:43.200 --> 58:48.120
 And what it looks like is if all the normal gradient flows

58:48.120 --> 58:52.080
 that you would associate with any non equilibrium system

58:52.080 --> 58:57.080
 apply in such a way that part of the Markov blanket

58:57.600 --> 59:01.560
 and the internal states seem to be hill climbing

59:01.560 --> 59:05.840
 or doing a gradient descent on the same quantity.

59:05.840 --> 59:09.360
 And that means that you can now describe

59:09.360 --> 59:13.120
 the very existence of this oil drop.

59:13.120 --> 59:16.000
 You can write down the existence of this oil drop

59:16.000 --> 59:20.600
 in terms of flows, dynamics, equations of motion,

59:20.600 --> 59:24.160
 where the blanket states or part of them,

59:24.160 --> 59:28.040
 we call them active states and the internal states

59:28.040 --> 59:32.680
 now seem to be and must be trying to look

59:32.680 --> 59:35.480
 as if they're minimizing the same function,

59:35.480 --> 59:39.280
 which is a low probability of occupying these states.

59:39.280 --> 59:44.040
 Interesting thing is that what would they be called

59:44.040 --> 59:45.680
 if you were trying to describe these things?

59:45.680 --> 59:50.080
 So what we're talking about are internal states,

59:50.080 --> 59:52.040
 external states and blanket states.

59:52.040 --> 59:54.080
 Now let's carve the blanket states

59:54.080 --> 59:57.200
 into two sensory states and active states.

59:57.200 --> 59:59.520
 Operationally, it has to be the case

59:59.520 --> 1:00:01.720
 that in order for this carving up

1:00:01.720 --> 1:00:04.440
 into different sets of states to exist,

1:00:04.440 --> 1:00:06.800
 the active states, the Markov blanket

1:00:06.800 --> 1:00:09.800
 cannot be influenced by the external states.

1:00:09.800 --> 1:00:11.560
 And we already know that the internal states

1:00:11.560 --> 1:00:13.640
 can't be influenced by the external states

1:00:13.640 --> 1:00:15.720
 because the blanket separates them.

1:00:15.720 --> 1:00:16.560
 So what does that mean?

1:00:16.560 --> 1:00:19.280
 Well, it means the active states, the internal states

1:00:19.280 --> 1:00:23.440
 are now jointly not influenced by external states.

1:00:23.440 --> 1:00:26.120
 They only have autonomous dynamics.

1:00:26.120 --> 1:00:30.000
 So now you've got a picture of an oil drop

1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:34.040
 that has autonomy, it has autonomous states,

1:00:34.040 --> 1:00:35.440
 it has autonomous states in the sense

1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:38.320
 that there must be some parts of the surface of the oil drop

1:00:38.320 --> 1:00:40.400
 that are not influenced by the external states

1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:41.880
 and all the interior.

1:00:41.880 --> 1:00:44.520
 And together, those two states endow

1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:47.640
 even a little oil drop with autonomous states

1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:51.360
 that look as if they are optimizing

1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:55.200
 their variational free energy or their negative elbow,

1:00:56.200 --> 1:00:57.840
 their moral evidence.

1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:03.240
 And that would be an interesting intellectual exercise.

1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:05.600
 And you could say, you could even go into the realms

1:01:05.600 --> 1:01:08.160
 of panpsychism, that everything that exists

1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:12.080
 is implicitly making inferences on self evidencing.

1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:17.040
 Now we make the next move, but what about living things?

1:01:17.040 --> 1:01:19.200
 I mean, so let me ask you,

1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:21.600
 what's the difference between an oil drop

1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:26.600
 and a little tadpole or a little lava or a plankton?

1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:29.640
 The picture was just painted of an oil drop.

1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:32.840
 Just immediately in a matter of minutes

1:01:32.840 --> 1:01:35.200
 took me into the world of panpsychism,

1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:38.040
 where you've just convinced me,

1:01:38.040 --> 1:01:41.240
 made me feel like an oil drop is a living,

1:01:41.240 --> 1:01:43.400
 it's certainly an autonomous system,

1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:44.720
 but almost a living system.

1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:48.960
 So it has sensory capabilities and acting capabilities

1:01:48.960 --> 1:01:50.600
 and it maintains something.

1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:53.920
 So what is the difference between that

1:01:53.920 --> 1:01:56.120
 and something that we traditionally

1:01:56.120 --> 1:01:57.680
 think of as a living system?

1:01:59.880 --> 1:02:02.200
 That it could die or it can't,

1:02:02.200 --> 1:02:05.240
 I mean, yeah, mortality, I'm not exactly sure.

1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:07.400
 I'm not sure what the right answer there is

1:02:08.640 --> 1:02:09.640
 because they can move,

1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:11.840
 like movement seems like an essential element

1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:13.520
 to being able to act in the environment,

1:02:13.520 --> 1:02:15.800
 but the oil drop is doing that.

1:02:15.800 --> 1:02:16.640
 So I don't know.

1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:18.120
 Is it?

1:02:18.120 --> 1:02:19.720
 The oil drop will be moved,

1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:22.640
 but does it in and of itself move autonomously?

1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:26.880
 Well, the surface is performing actions

1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:29.680
 that maintain its structure.

1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:30.800
 Yeah, you're being too clever.

1:02:30.800 --> 1:02:34.560
 I was, I had in mind a passive little oil drop

1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:37.680
 that's sitting there at the bottom

1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:39.240
 on the top of a glass of water.

1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:40.600
 Sure, I guess.

1:02:40.600 --> 1:02:42.200
 What I'm trying to say is you're absolutely right.

1:02:42.200 --> 1:02:44.400
 You've nailed it.

1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:45.880
 It's movement.

1:02:45.880 --> 1:02:47.200
 So where does that movement come from?

1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:49.400
 If it comes from the inside,

1:02:49.400 --> 1:02:52.000
 then you've got, I think, something that's living.

1:02:53.320 --> 1:02:54.680
 What do you mean from the inside?

1:02:54.680 --> 1:02:58.840
 What I mean is that the internal states

1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:01.040
 that can influence the active states,

1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:02.600
 where the active states can influence,

1:03:02.600 --> 1:03:05.120
 but they're not influenced by the external states,

1:03:05.120 --> 1:03:07.160
 can cause movement.

1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:10.440
 So there are two types of oil drops, if you like.

1:03:10.440 --> 1:03:12.800
 There are oil drops where the internal states

1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:17.800
 are so random that they average themselves away,

1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:23.800
 and the thing cannot, on average,

1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:25.960
 when you do the averaging, move.

1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:29.400
 So a nice example of that would be the Sun.

1:03:29.400 --> 1:03:31.160
 The Sun certainly has internal states.

1:03:31.160 --> 1:03:34.360
 There's lots of intrinsic autonomous activity going on,

1:03:34.360 --> 1:03:35.840
 but because it's not coordinated,

1:03:35.840 --> 1:03:38.080
 because it doesn't have the deep, in the millennial sense,

1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:40.960
 the hierarchical structure that the brain does,

1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:45.800
 there is no overall mode or pattern or organization

1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:48.160
 that expresses itself on the surface

1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:50.080
 that allows it to actually swim.

1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:54.080
 It can certainly have a very active surface,

1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:58.280
 but en masse, at the scale of the actual surface of the Sun,

1:03:58.280 --> 1:04:02.920
 the average position of that surface cannot, in itself, move,

1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:06.680
 because the internal dynamics are more like a hot gas.

1:04:06.680 --> 1:04:08.480
 They are literally like a hot gas,

1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:11.440
 whereas your internal dynamics are much more structured

1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:12.880
 and deeply structured,

1:04:12.880 --> 1:04:16.440
 and now you can express on your active states

1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:19.720
 with your muscles and your secretory organs,

1:04:19.720 --> 1:04:22.920
 your autonomic nervous system and its effectors,

1:04:22.920 --> 1:04:26.760
 you can actually move, and that's all you can do.

1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:28.240
 And that's something which,

1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:30.440
 if you haven't thought of it like this before,

1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:32.440
 I think it's nice to just realize

1:04:32.440 --> 1:04:37.040
 there is no other way that you can change the universe

1:04:37.040 --> 1:04:39.240
 other than simply moving.

1:04:39.240 --> 1:04:43.840
 Whether that moving is articulating with my voice box

1:04:43.840 --> 1:04:46.600
 or walking around or squeezing juices

1:04:46.600 --> 1:04:48.720
 out of my secretory organs,

1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:51.960
 there's only one way you can change the universe.

1:04:51.960 --> 1:04:53.240
 It's moving.

1:04:53.240 --> 1:04:58.600
 And the fact that you do so nonrandomly makes you alive.

1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:00.600
 Yeah, so it's that nonrandomness.

1:05:00.600 --> 1:05:04.840
 And that would be manifested,

1:05:04.840 --> 1:05:07.800
 we realize, in terms of essentially swimming,

1:05:07.800 --> 1:05:10.480
 essentially moving, changing one's shape,

1:05:10.480 --> 1:05:15.760
 a morphogenesis that is dynamic and possibly adaptive.

1:05:15.760 --> 1:05:17.920
 So that's what I was trying to get at

1:05:17.920 --> 1:05:19.160
 between the difference between the oil drop

1:05:19.160 --> 1:05:21.000
 and the little tadpole.

1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:23.000
 The tadpole is moving around.

1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:26.920
 Its active states are actually changing the external states.

1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:28.480
 And there's now a cycle,

1:05:28.480 --> 1:05:30.400
 an action perception cycle, if you like,

1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:34.040
 a recurrent dynamic that's going on

1:05:34.040 --> 1:05:39.360
 that depends upon this deeply structured autonomous behavior

1:05:39.360 --> 1:05:44.600
 that rests upon internal dynamics

1:05:44.600 --> 1:05:48.880
 that are not only modeling

1:05:48.880 --> 1:05:53.800
 the data impressed upon their surface or the blanket states,

1:05:53.800 --> 1:05:58.800
 but they are actively resampling those data by moving.

1:05:58.800 --> 1:06:03.920
 They're moving towards chemical gradients and chemotaxis.

1:06:03.920 --> 1:06:08.280
 So they've gone beyond just being good little models

1:06:08.280 --> 1:06:11.120
 of the kind of world they live in.

1:06:11.120 --> 1:06:15.960
 For example, an oil droplet could, in a panpsychic sense,

1:06:15.960 --> 1:06:18.440
 be construed as a little being

1:06:18.440 --> 1:06:20.720
 that has now perfectly inferred.

1:06:20.720 --> 1:06:23.800
 It's a passive, nonliving oil drop

1:06:23.800 --> 1:06:25.600
 living in a bowl of water.

1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:27.960
 No problem.

1:06:27.960 --> 1:06:31.040
 But to now equip that oil drop with the ability to go out

1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:34.040
 and test that hypothesis about different states of beings.

1:06:34.040 --> 1:06:36.920
 So it can actually push its surface over there, over there,

1:06:36.920 --> 1:06:38.680
 and test for chemical gradients,

1:06:38.680 --> 1:06:42.880
 or then you start to move to a much more lifelike form.

1:06:42.880 --> 1:06:44.920
 This is all fun, theoretically interesting,

1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:47.000
 but it actually is quite important

1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.800
 in terms of reflecting what I have seen

1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:53.120
 since the turn of the millennium,

1:06:53.120 --> 1:06:56.600
 which is this move towards an inactive

1:06:56.600 --> 1:07:00.760
 and embodied understanding of intelligence.

1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:03.760
 And you say you're from machine learning.

1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:05.720
 So what that means,

1:07:05.720 --> 1:07:10.680
 the central importance of movement,

1:07:10.680 --> 1:07:14.000
 I think has yet to really hit machine learning.

1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:20.400
 It certainly has now diffused itself throughout robotics.

1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:23.200
 And perhaps you could say certain problems in active vision

1:07:23.200 --> 1:07:25.360
 where you actually have to move the camera

1:07:25.360 --> 1:07:27.240
 to sample this and that.

1:07:27.240 --> 1:07:31.600
 But machine learning of the data mining deep learning sort

1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:34.000
 simply hasn't contended with this issue.

1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:37.240
 What it's done, instead of dealing with the movement problem

1:07:37.240 --> 1:07:39.160
 and the active sampling of data,

1:07:39.160 --> 1:07:40.720
 it's just said, we don't need to worry about,

1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:43.120
 we can see all the data because we've got big data.

1:07:43.120 --> 1:07:45.120
 So we can ignore movement.

1:07:45.120 --> 1:07:50.920
 So that for me is an important omission

1:07:50.920 --> 1:07:52.200
 in current machine learning.

1:07:52.200 --> 1:07:54.800
 The current machine learning is much more like the oil drop.

1:07:54.800 --> 1:07:55.960
 Yes.

1:07:55.960 --> 1:07:59.480
 But an oil drop that enjoys exposure

1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:03.600
 to nearly all the data that it will ever need to be exposed to,

1:08:03.600 --> 1:08:05.760
 as opposed to the tadpoles swimming out

1:08:05.760 --> 1:08:07.360
 to find the right data.

1:08:07.360 --> 1:08:10.320
 For example, it likes food.

1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:11.240
 That's a good hypothesis.

1:08:11.240 --> 1:08:12.080
 Let's test it out.

1:08:12.080 --> 1:08:15.720
 Let's go and move and ingest food, for example,

1:08:15.720 --> 1:08:18.680
 and see is that evidence that I'm the kind of thing

1:08:18.680 --> 1:08:20.400
 that likes this kind of food.

1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:24.000
 So the next natural question, and forgive this question,

1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:27.120
 but if we think of sort of even artificial intelligence

1:08:27.120 --> 1:08:29.440
 systems, which I just painted a beautiful picture

1:08:29.440 --> 1:08:32.840
 of existence and life.

1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:39.920
 So do you ascribe, do you find within this framework

1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:45.240
 a possibility of defining consciousness

1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:47.360
 or exploring the idea of consciousness?

1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:52.760
 Like what, you know, self awareness

1:08:52.760 --> 1:08:55.160
 and expand it to consciousness?

1:08:55.160 --> 1:08:56.160
 Yeah.

1:08:56.160 --> 1:08:58.840
 How can we start to think about consciousness

1:08:58.840 --> 1:08:59.720
 within this framework?

1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:00.920
 Is it possible?

1:09:00.920 --> 1:09:03.160
 Well, yeah, I think it's possible to think about it,

1:09:03.160 --> 1:09:04.320
 whether you'll get it.

1:09:04.320 --> 1:09:06.400
 Get anywhere is another question.

1:09:06.400 --> 1:09:10.320
 And again, I'm not sure that I'm licensed

1:09:10.320 --> 1:09:12.760
 to answer that question.

1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:15.120
 I think you'd have to speak to a qualified philosopher

1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:17.320
 to get a definitive answer to that.

1:09:17.320 --> 1:09:19.680
 But certainly, there's a lot of interest

1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:23.400
 in using not just these ideas, but related ideas

1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:27.960
 from information theory to try and tie down

1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:34.080
 the maths and the calculus and the geometry of consciousness,

1:09:34.080 --> 1:09:39.720
 either in terms of sort of a minimal consciousness,

1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:42.440
 even less than a minimal selfhood.

1:09:42.440 --> 1:09:48.320
 And what I'm talking about is the ability, effectively,

1:09:48.320 --> 1:09:52.440
 to plan, to have agency.

1:09:52.440 --> 1:09:57.760
 So you could argue that a virus does have a form of agency

1:09:57.760 --> 1:10:00.360
 in virtue of the way that it selectively

1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:05.880
 finds hosts and cells to live in and moves around.

1:10:05.880 --> 1:10:09.280
 But you wouldn't endow it with the capacity

1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:14.880
 to think about planning and moving in a purposeful way

1:10:14.880 --> 1:10:17.280
 where it countenances the future.

1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:18.680
 Whereas you might an ant.

1:10:18.680 --> 1:10:22.040
 You might think an ant's not quite as unconscious

1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:24.280
 as a virus.

1:10:24.280 --> 1:10:26.160
 It certainly seems to have a purpose.

1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:29.680
 It talks to its friends en route during its foraging.

1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:37.160
 It has a different kind of autonomy, which is biotic,

1:10:37.160 --> 1:10:38.720
 but beyond a virus.

1:10:38.720 --> 1:10:41.400
 So there's something about, so there's

1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:45.680
 some line that has to do with the complexity of planning

1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:48.000
 that may contain an answer.

1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:49.960
 I mean, it would be beautiful if we

1:10:49.960 --> 1:10:55.480
 can find a line beyond which we could say a being is conscious.

1:10:55.480 --> 1:10:56.560
 Yes, it will be.

1:10:56.560 --> 1:11:00.800
 These are wonderful lines that we've drawn with existence,

1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:02.680
 life, and consciousness.

1:11:02.680 --> 1:11:05.320
 Yes, it will be very nice.

1:11:05.320 --> 1:11:07.280
 One little wrinkle there, and this

1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:09.400
 is something I've only learned in the past few months,

1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:12.400
 is the philosophical notion of vagueness.

1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:14.840
 So you're saying it would be wonderful to draw a line.

1:11:14.840 --> 1:11:18.080
 I had always assumed that that line at some point

1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:22.720
 would be drawn until about four months ago,

1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:24.880
 and the philosopher taught me about vagueness.

1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:26.720
 So I don't know if you've come across this,

1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:28.440
 but it's a technical concept.

1:11:28.440 --> 1:11:33.480
 And I think most revealingly illustrated with,

1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:37.120
 at what point does a pile of sand become a pile?

1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:41.620
 Is it one grain, two grains, three grains, or four grains?

1:11:41.620 --> 1:11:44.200
 So at what point would you draw the line

1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:51.320
 between being a pile of sand and a collection of grains of sand?

1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:53.520
 In the same way, is it right to ask,

1:11:53.520 --> 1:11:55.560
 where would I draw the line between conscious

1:11:55.560 --> 1:11:56.740
 and unconscious?

1:11:56.740 --> 1:11:59.680
 And it might be a vague concept.

1:11:59.680 --> 1:12:02.920
 Having said that, I agree with you entirely.

1:12:02.920 --> 1:12:06.480
 Systems that have the ability to plan.

1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:08.440
 So just technically, what that means

1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:13.880
 is your inferential self evidencing,

1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:19.880
 by which I simply mean the thermodynamics and gradient

1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:22.960
 flows that underwrite the preservation of your oil

1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:29.080
 droplet like form, can be described

1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:32.560
 as an optimization of log Bayesian model

1:12:32.560 --> 1:12:36.680
 evidence, your elbow.

1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:39.760
 That self evidencing must be evidence

1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:44.000
 for a model of what's causing the sensory impressions

1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:47.040
 on the sensory part of your surface or your Markov

1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:48.520
 blanket.

1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:51.160
 If that model is capable of planning,

1:12:51.160 --> 1:12:53.800
 it must include a model of the future consequences

1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:56.800
 of your active states or your action, just planning.

1:12:56.800 --> 1:12:59.200
 So we're now in the game of planning as inference.

1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:00.620
 Now notice what we've made, though.

1:13:00.620 --> 1:13:04.400
 We've made quite a big move away from big data and machine

1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:08.520
 learning, because again, it's the consequences of moving.

1:13:08.520 --> 1:13:11.600
 It's the consequences of selecting those data or those

1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:14.240
 data or looking over there.

1:13:14.240 --> 1:13:17.420
 And that tells you immediately that even

1:13:17.420 --> 1:13:22.760
 to be a contender for a conscious artifact or a strong

1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:26.760
 AI or generalized, I don't know what that's called nowadays,

1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:29.280
 then you've got to have movement in the game.

1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:32.560
 And furthermore, you've got to have a generative model

1:13:32.560 --> 1:13:34.920
 of the sort you might find in, say, a variational auto

1:13:34.920 --> 1:13:39.840
 encoder that is thinking about the future conditioned

1:13:39.840 --> 1:13:41.900
 upon different courses of action.

1:13:41.900 --> 1:13:44.400
 Now that brings a number of things to the table, which

1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:46.280
 now you start to think, well, those

1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:47.400
 have got all the right ingredients

1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:48.640
 to talk about consciousness.

1:13:48.640 --> 1:13:51.600
 I've now got to select among a number of different courses

1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:54.920
 of action into the future as part of planning.

1:13:54.920 --> 1:13:56.440
 I've now got free will.

1:13:56.440 --> 1:13:59.440
 The act of selecting this course of action or that policy

1:13:59.440 --> 1:14:02.480
 or that policy or that action suddenly

1:14:02.480 --> 1:14:04.720
 makes me into an inference machine,

1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:09.480
 a self evidencing artifact that now

1:14:09.480 --> 1:14:12.480
 looks as if it's selecting amongst different alternative

1:14:12.480 --> 1:14:15.480
 ways forward, as I actively swim here or swim there

1:14:15.480 --> 1:14:17.920
 or look over here, look over there.

1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:19.920
 So I think you've now got to a situation

1:14:19.920 --> 1:14:22.240
 if there is planning in the mix.

1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:25.200
 You're now getting much closer to that line

1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:27.360
 if that line were ever to exist.

1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:32.400
 I don't think it gets you quite as far as self aware, though.

1:14:32.400 --> 1:14:39.680
 And then you have to, I think, grapple with the question,

1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:43.160
 how would formally write down a calculus or a maths

1:14:43.160 --> 1:14:44.620
 of self awareness?

1:14:44.620 --> 1:14:47.840
 I don't think it's impossible to do.

1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:51.400
 But I think there would be pressure on you

1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:53.360
 to actually commit to a formal definition of what

1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:55.920
 you mean by self awareness.

1:14:55.920 --> 1:15:00.480
 I think most people that I know would probably

1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:07.000
 say that a goldfish, a pet fish, was not self aware.

1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:10.600
 They would probably argue about their favorite cat,

1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:14.000
 but would be quite happy to say that their mom was self aware.

1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:15.480
 So.

1:15:15.480 --> 1:15:17.400
 I mean, but that might very well connect

1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:20.960
 to some level of complexity with planning.

1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:26.520
 It seems like self awareness is essential for complex planning.

1:15:26.520 --> 1:15:27.240
 Yeah.

1:15:27.240 --> 1:15:28.080
 Do you want to take that further?

1:15:28.080 --> 1:15:29.880
 Because I think you're absolutely right.

1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:31.400
 Again, the line is unclear, but it

1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:36.400
 seems like integrating yourself into the world,

1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:42.320
 into your planning, is essential for constructing complex plans.

1:15:42.320 --> 1:15:43.080
 Yes.

1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:43.720
 Yeah.

1:15:43.720 --> 1:15:47.440
 So mathematically describing that in the same elegant way

1:15:47.440 --> 1:15:51.120
 as you have with the free energy principle might be difficult.

1:15:51.120 --> 1:15:53.360
 Well, yes and no.

1:15:53.360 --> 1:15:55.360
 I don't think that, well, perhaps we should just,

1:15:55.360 --> 1:15:57.000
 can we just go back?

1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:58.720
 That's a very important answer you gave.

1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:01.880
 And I think if I just unpacked it,

1:16:01.880 --> 1:16:06.480
 you'd see the truisms that you've just exposed for us.

1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:10.400
 But let me, sorry, I'm mindful that I didn't answer

1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:11.360
 your question before.

1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:13.880
 Well, what's the free energy principle good for?

1:16:13.880 --> 1:16:15.680
 Is it just a pretty theoretical exercise

1:16:15.680 --> 1:16:17.880
 to explain nonequilibrium steady states?

1:16:17.880 --> 1:16:19.400
 Yes, it is.

1:16:19.400 --> 1:16:21.360
 It does nothing more for you than that.

1:16:21.360 --> 1:16:24.040
 It can be regarded, it's going to sound very arrogant,

1:16:24.040 --> 1:16:27.880
 but it is of the sort of theory of natural selection,

1:16:27.880 --> 1:16:32.800
 or a hypothesis of natural selection.

1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:37.200
 Beautiful, undeniably true, but tells you

1:16:37.200 --> 1:16:42.040
 absolutely nothing about why you have legs and eyes.

1:16:42.040 --> 1:16:44.720
 It tells you nothing about the actual phenotype,

1:16:44.720 --> 1:16:48.080
 and it wouldn't allow you to build something.

1:16:48.080 --> 1:16:51.120
 So the free energy principle by itself

1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:54.880
 is as vacuous as most tautological theories.

1:16:54.880 --> 1:16:56.200
 And by tautological, of course,

1:16:56.200 --> 1:16:58.800
 I'm talking to the theory of natural,

1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:00.080
 the survival of the fittest.

1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:01.760
 What's the fittest of those that survive?

1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:02.600
 Why do they cycle?

1:17:02.600 --> 1:17:03.440
 It's the fitter.

1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:05.640
 It just goes around in circles.

1:17:05.640 --> 1:17:08.560
 In a sense, the free energy principle has that same

1:17:08.560 --> 1:17:11.480
 deflationary tautology under the hood.

1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:17.680
 It's a characteristic of things that exist.

1:17:17.680 --> 1:17:18.520
 Why do they exist?

1:17:18.520 --> 1:17:19.720
 Because they minimize their free energy.

1:17:19.720 --> 1:17:21.400
 Why do they minimize their free energy?

1:17:21.400 --> 1:17:22.440
 Because they exist.

1:17:22.440 --> 1:17:24.720
 And you just keep on going round and round and round.

1:17:24.720 --> 1:17:28.080
 But the practical thing,

1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:32.680
 which you don't get from natural selection,

1:17:32.680 --> 1:17:35.680
 but you could say has now manifest in things

1:17:35.680 --> 1:17:38.160
 like differential evolution or genetic algorithms

1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:41.320
 and MCMC, for example, in machine learning.

1:17:41.320 --> 1:17:43.240
 The practical thing you can get is,

1:17:43.240 --> 1:17:45.440
 if it looks as if things that exist

1:17:45.440 --> 1:17:49.400
 are trying to have density dynamics

1:17:49.400 --> 1:17:51.560
 and look as though they're optimizing

1:17:51.560 --> 1:17:53.320
 a variational free energy,

1:17:53.320 --> 1:17:55.200
 and a variational free energy has to be

1:17:55.200 --> 1:17:57.280
 a functional of a generative model,

1:17:57.280 --> 1:18:01.720
 a probabilistic description of causes and consequences,

1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:04.560
 causes out there, consequences in the sensorium

1:18:04.560 --> 1:18:07.080
 on the sensory parts of the Markov blanket,

1:18:07.080 --> 1:18:08.680
 then it should, in theory, be possible

1:18:08.680 --> 1:18:10.400
 to write down the generative model,

1:18:10.400 --> 1:18:11.840
 work out the gradients,

1:18:11.840 --> 1:18:15.920
 and then cause it to autonomously self evidence.

1:18:15.920 --> 1:18:18.160
 So you should be able to write down oil droplets.

1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:20.080
 You should be able to create artifacts

1:18:20.080 --> 1:18:24.240
 where you have supplied the objective function

1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:25.560
 that supplies the gradients,

1:18:25.560 --> 1:18:28.320
 that supplies the self organizing dynamics

1:18:28.320 --> 1:18:30.280
 to non equilibrium steady state.

1:18:30.280 --> 1:18:32.680
 So there is actually a practical application

1:18:32.680 --> 1:18:34.120
 of the free energy principle

1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:37.800
 when you can write down your required evidence

1:18:37.800 --> 1:18:40.400
 in terms of, well, when you can write down

1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:43.720
 the generative model that is the thing

1:18:43.720 --> 1:18:44.800
 that has the evidence.

1:18:44.800 --> 1:18:46.760
 The probability of these sensory data

1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:50.880
 or this data, given that model,

1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:54.200
 is effectively the thing that the elbow

1:18:54.200 --> 1:18:57.400
 or the variational free energy bounds or approximates.

1:18:57.400 --> 1:19:00.800
 That means that you can actually write down the model

1:19:01.720 --> 1:19:04.640
 and the kind of thing that you want to engineer,

1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:07.840
 the kind of AGI or artificial general intelligence

1:19:10.440 --> 1:19:14.480
 that you want to manifest probabilistically,

1:19:14.480 --> 1:19:16.720
 and then you engineer, a lot of hard work,

1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:19.760
 but you would engineer a robot and a computer

1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:23.400
 to perform a gradient descent on that objective function.

1:19:23.400 --> 1:19:26.160
 So it does have a practical implication.

1:19:26.160 --> 1:19:27.440
 Now, why am I wittering on about that?

1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:28.880
 It did seem relevant to, yes.

1:19:28.880 --> 1:19:32.920
 So what kinds of, so the answer to,

1:19:32.920 --> 1:19:34.240
 would it be easier or would it be hard?

1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:36.200
 Well, mathematically, it's easy.

1:19:36.200 --> 1:19:38.000
 I've just told you all you need to do

1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:43.000
 is write down your perfect artifact,

1:19:43.880 --> 1:19:45.280
 probabilistically, in the form

1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:46.480
 of a probabilistic generative model,

1:19:46.480 --> 1:19:48.800
 a probability distribution over the causes

1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:52.520
 and consequences of the world

1:19:52.520 --> 1:19:54.680
 in which this thing is immersed.

1:19:54.680 --> 1:19:58.040
 And then you just engineer a computer and a robot

1:19:58.040 --> 1:20:00.800
 to perform a gradient descent on that objective function.

1:20:00.800 --> 1:20:01.640
 No problem.

1:20:02.720 --> 1:20:04.160
 But of course, the big problem

1:20:04.160 --> 1:20:05.960
 is writing down the generative model.

1:20:05.960 --> 1:20:08.040
 So that's where the heavy lifting comes in.

1:20:08.040 --> 1:20:12.160
 So it's the form and the structure of that generative model

1:20:12.160 --> 1:20:15.640
 which basically defines the artifact that you will create

1:20:15.640 --> 1:20:19.600
 or, indeed, the kind of artifact that has self awareness.

1:20:19.600 --> 1:20:22.080
 So that's where all the hard work comes,

1:20:22.080 --> 1:20:24.640
 very much like natural selection doesn't tell you

1:20:24.640 --> 1:20:27.000
 in the slightest why you have eyes.

1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:29.480
 So you have to drill down on the actual phenotype,

1:20:29.480 --> 1:20:31.480
 the actual generative model.

1:20:31.480 --> 1:20:36.360
 So with that in mind, what did you tell me

1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:40.720
 that tells me immediately the kinds of generative models

1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:43.480
 I would have to write down in order to have self awareness?

1:20:43.480 --> 1:20:48.200
 What you said to me was I have to have a model

1:20:48.200 --> 1:20:50.440
 that is effectively fit for purpose

1:20:50.440 --> 1:20:53.680
 for this kind of world in which I operate.

1:20:53.680 --> 1:20:55.880
 And if I now make the observation

1:20:55.880 --> 1:20:59.120
 that this kind of world is effectively largely populated

1:20:59.120 --> 1:21:01.360
 by other things like me, i.e. you,

1:21:02.360 --> 1:21:04.200
 then it makes enormous sense

1:21:04.200 --> 1:21:07.280
 that if I can develop a hypothesis

1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:11.520
 that we are similar kinds of creatures,

1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:13.640
 in fact, the same kind of creature,

1:21:13.640 --> 1:21:16.320
 but I am me and you are you,

1:21:16.320 --> 1:21:21.320
 then it becomes, again, mandated to have a sense of self.

1:21:21.440 --> 1:21:23.640
 So if I live in a world

1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:26.560
 that is constituted by things like me,

1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:29.520
 basically a social world, a community,

1:21:29.520 --> 1:21:32.320
 then it becomes necessary now for me to infer

1:21:32.320 --> 1:21:34.400
 that it's me talking and not you talking.

1:21:34.400 --> 1:21:37.280
 I wouldn't need that if I was on Mars by myself

1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:40.040
 or if I was in the jungle as a feral child.

1:21:40.040 --> 1:21:43.120
 If there was nothing like me around,

1:21:43.120 --> 1:21:46.200
 there would be no need to have an inference

1:21:46.200 --> 1:21:49.160
 at a hypothesis, oh yes, it is me

1:21:49.160 --> 1:21:51.240
 that is experiencing or causing these sounds

1:21:51.240 --> 1:21:52.360
 and it is not you.

1:21:52.360 --> 1:21:54.680
 It's only when there's ambiguity in play

1:21:54.680 --> 1:21:58.240
 induced by the fact that there are others in that world.

1:21:58.240 --> 1:22:03.240
 So I think that the special thing about self aware artifacts

1:22:03.520 --> 1:22:08.280
 is that they have learned to, or they have acquired,

1:22:08.280 --> 1:22:11.680
 or at least are equipped with, possibly by evolution,

1:22:11.680 --> 1:22:14.560
 generative models that allow for the fact

1:22:14.560 --> 1:22:17.360
 there are lots of copies of things like them around,

1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:20.600
 and therefore they have to work out it's you and not me.

1:22:20.600 --> 1:22:23.280
 That's brilliant.

1:22:23.280 --> 1:22:24.560
 I've never thought of that.

1:22:24.560 --> 1:22:28.160
 I never thought of that, that the purpose

1:22:28.160 --> 1:22:31.360
 of the really usefulness of consciousness

1:22:31.360 --> 1:22:34.200
 or self awareness in the context of planning

1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:36.920
 existing in the world is so you can operate

1:22:36.920 --> 1:22:39.240
 with other things like you, and like you could,

1:22:39.240 --> 1:22:40.800
 it doesn't have to necessarily be human.

1:22:40.800 --> 1:22:43.480
 It could be other kind of similar creatures.

1:22:43.480 --> 1:22:46.080
 Absolutely, well, we view a lot of our attributes

1:22:46.080 --> 1:22:47.880
 into our pets, don't we?

1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:49.920
 Or we try to make our robots humanoid.

1:22:49.920 --> 1:22:51.840
 And I think there's a deep reason for that,

1:22:51.840 --> 1:22:54.680
 that it's just much easier to read the world

1:22:54.680 --> 1:22:56.240
 if you can make the simplifying assumption

1:22:56.240 --> 1:23:00.040
 that basically you're me, and it's just your turn to talk.

1:23:00.040 --> 1:23:01.520
 I mean, when we talk about planning,

1:23:01.520 --> 1:23:04.200
 when you talk specifically about planning,

1:23:04.200 --> 1:23:07.800
 the highest, if you like, manifestation or realization

1:23:07.800 --> 1:23:09.600
 of that planning is what we're doing now.

1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:12.560
 I mean, the human condition doesn't get any higher

1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:16.800
 than this talking about the philosophy of existence

1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:17.920
 and the conversation.

1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:22.920
 But in that conversation, there is a beautiful art

1:23:23.760 --> 1:23:28.120
 of turn taking and mutual inference, theory of mind.

1:23:28.120 --> 1:23:29.680
 I have to know when you wanna listen.

1:23:29.680 --> 1:23:31.120
 I have to know when you want to interrupt.

1:23:31.120 --> 1:23:32.520
 I have to make sure that you're online.

1:23:32.520 --> 1:23:34.360
 I have to have a model in my head

1:23:34.360 --> 1:23:35.800
 of your model in your head.

1:23:35.800 --> 1:23:38.320
 That's the highest, the most sophisticated form

1:23:38.320 --> 1:23:40.160
 of generative model, where the generative model

1:23:40.160 --> 1:23:41.360
 actually has a generative model

1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:42.800
 of somebody else's generative model.

1:23:42.800 --> 1:23:47.080
 And I think that, and what we are doing now evinces

1:23:47.080 --> 1:23:49.160
 the kinds of generative models

1:23:49.160 --> 1:23:51.280
 that would support self awareness,

1:23:51.280 --> 1:23:54.640
 because without that, we'd both be talking over each other,

1:23:54.640 --> 1:23:57.440
 or we'd be singing together in a choir.

1:23:58.320 --> 1:24:01.280
 That's not a brilliant analogy for what I'm trying to say,

1:24:01.280 --> 1:24:05.160
 but yeah, we wouldn't have this discourse.

1:24:05.160 --> 1:24:06.000
 We wouldn't have this.

1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:06.840
 Yeah, the dance of it.

1:24:06.840 --> 1:24:07.680
 Yeah, that's right.

1:24:07.680 --> 1:24:12.680
 As I interrupt, I mean, that's beautifully put.

1:24:12.680 --> 1:24:17.360
 I'll re listen to this conversation many times.

1:24:17.360 --> 1:24:21.600
 There's so much poetry in this, and mathematics.

1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:26.240
 Let me ask the silliest, or perhaps the biggest question

1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:28.880
 as a last kind of question.

1:24:29.840 --> 1:24:33.360
 We've talked about living in existence

1:24:33.360 --> 1:24:35.120
 and the objective function under which

1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:37.480
 these objects would operate.

1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:39.720
 What do you think is the objective function

1:24:39.720 --> 1:24:41.560
 of our existence?

1:24:41.560 --> 1:24:44.160
 What's the meaning of life?

1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:47.160
 What do you think is the, for you, perhaps,

1:24:47.160 --> 1:24:50.200
 the purpose, the source of fulfillment,

1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:53.080
 the source of meaning for your existence,

1:24:53.080 --> 1:24:57.640
 as one blob in this soup?

1:24:57.640 --> 1:25:00.480
 I'm tempted to answer that, again, as a physicist,

1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:03.040
 until it's the free energy I expect

1:25:03.040 --> 1:25:05.480
 consequent upon my behavior.

1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:08.400
 So technically, we could get a really interesting

1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:10.720
 conversation about what that comprises

1:25:10.720 --> 1:25:13.160
 in terms of searching for information,

1:25:13.160 --> 1:25:16.560
 resolving uncertainty about the kind of thing that I am.

1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:20.240
 But I suspect that you want a slightly more personal

1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:25.120
 and fun answer, but which can be consistent with that.

1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:30.120
 And I think it's reassuringly simple

1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:35.320
 and hops back to what you were taught as a child,

1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:39.520
 that you have certain beliefs about the kind of creature

1:25:39.520 --> 1:25:41.840
 and the kind of person you are.

1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:44.840
 And all that self evidencing means,

1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:46.840
 all that minimizing variational free energy

1:25:46.840 --> 1:25:50.000
 in an inactive and embodied way,

1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:53.640
 means is fulfilling the beliefs about

1:25:53.640 --> 1:25:55.720
 what kind of thing you are.

1:25:55.720 --> 1:25:58.040
 And of course, we're all given those scripts,

1:25:58.040 --> 1:26:01.240
 those narratives, at a very early age,

1:26:01.240 --> 1:26:04.280
 usually in the form of bedtime stories or fairy stories

1:26:04.280 --> 1:26:07.160
 that I'm a princess and I'm gonna meet a beast

1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:09.360
 who's gonna transform and he's gonna be a prince.

1:26:09.360 --> 1:26:11.880
 And so the narratives are all around you

1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:14.560
 from your parents to the friends

1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:17.680
 to the society feeds these stories.

1:26:17.680 --> 1:26:21.000
 And then your objective function is to fulfill.

1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:24.240
 Exactly, that narrative that has been encultured

1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:27.160
 by your immediate family, but as you say,

1:26:27.160 --> 1:26:29.600
 also the sort of the culture in which you grew up

1:26:29.600 --> 1:26:30.880
 and you create for yourself.

1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:33.440
 I mean, again, because of this active inference,

1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:36.680
 this inactive aspect of self evidencing,

1:26:36.680 --> 1:26:40.960
 not only am I modeling my environment,

1:26:40.960 --> 1:26:44.040
 my eco niche, my external states out there,

1:26:44.040 --> 1:26:46.520
 but I'm actively changing them all the time

1:26:46.520 --> 1:26:49.840
 and doing the same back, we're doing it together.

1:26:49.840 --> 1:26:53.680
 So there's a synchrony that means that I'm creating

1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:56.800
 my own culture over different timescales.

1:26:56.800 --> 1:27:00.800
 So the question now is for me being very selfish,

1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:02.240
 what scripts were I given?

1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:06.160
 It basically was a mixture between Einstein and shark homes.

1:27:06.160 --> 1:27:08.840
 So I smoke as heavily as possible,

1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:12.560
 try to avoid too much interpersonal contact,

1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:20.280
 enjoy the fantasy that you're a popular scientist

1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:23.400
 who's gonna make a difference in a slightly quirky way.

1:27:23.400 --> 1:27:25.200
 So that's what I grew up on.

1:27:25.200 --> 1:27:28.320
 My father was an engineer and loved science

1:27:28.320 --> 1:27:33.320
 and he loved sort of things like Sir Arthur Edmonds,

1:27:33.320 --> 1:27:37.440
 Spacetime and Gravitation, which was the first

1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:40.800
 understandable version of general relativity.

1:27:41.800 --> 1:27:45.840
 So all the fairy stories I was told as I was growing up

1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:47.680
 were all about these characters.

1:27:48.640 --> 1:27:50.600
 I'm keeping the Hobbit out of this

1:27:50.600 --> 1:27:53.280
 because that doesn't quite fit my narrative.

1:27:53.280 --> 1:27:56.240
 There's a journey of exploration, I suppose, of sorts.

1:27:56.240 --> 1:28:01.240
 So yeah, I've just grown up to be what I imagine

1:28:01.240 --> 1:28:05.720
 a mild mannered Sherlock Holmes slash Albert Einstein

1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:07.960
 would do in my shoes.

1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:10.080
 And you did it elegantly and beautifully.

1:28:10.080 --> 1:28:12.440
 Carl was a huge honor talking today, it was fun.

1:28:12.440 --> 1:28:13.560
 Thank you so much for your time.

1:28:13.560 --> 1:28:15.560
 No, thank you. Appreciate it.

1:28:15.560 --> 1:28:17.240

 And now let me leave you with some words from Carl Friston.

1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:44.600
 Your arm moves because you predict it will

1:28:44.600 --> 1:28:48.040
 and your motor system seeks to minimize prediction error.

1:28:48.040 --> 1:29:01.040
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
