00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
 The following is a conversation with Norman Namark,

00:03.360 --> 00:05.920
 a historian at Stanford specializing in

00:05.920 --> 00:09.400
 genocide, war, and empire.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.600
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.860
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:13.860 --> 00:15.080
 in the description.

00:15.080 --> 00:18.960
 And now, here's my conversation with Norman Namark.

00:20.160 --> 00:22.500
 Did Stalin believe that communism was good

00:22.500 --> 00:25.400
 not just for him, but for the people of the Soviet Union

00:25.400 --> 00:26.960
 and the people of the world?

00:26.960 --> 00:31.040
 Oh, absolutely, I mean, Stalin believed that, you know,

00:31.040 --> 00:34.600
 socialism was the be all and end all of,

00:34.600 --> 00:36.800
 you know, human existence.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.440
 I mean, he was a true Leninist,

00:38.440 --> 00:42.200
 and in Lenin's tradition, this was, you know,

00:42.200 --> 00:43.180
 what he believed.

00:43.180 --> 00:46.360
 I mean, that set of beliefs didn't exclude

00:46.360 --> 00:49.900
 other kinds of things he believed or thought or did.

00:49.900 --> 00:53.960
 But, no, the way he defined socialism,

00:53.960 --> 00:55.920
 the way he thought about socialism,

00:55.920 --> 00:57.760
 you know, he absolutely thought it was in the interest

00:57.760 --> 00:59.520
 of the Soviet Union and of the world.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.600
 And, in fact, that the world was one day going to go

01:02.600 --> 01:03.840
 socialist, in other words.

01:03.840 --> 01:06.620
 I think he believed in, eventually,

01:06.620 --> 01:08.320
 in the international revolution.

01:09.280 --> 01:13.880
 So, given the genocide in the 1930s that you describe,

01:13.880 --> 01:17.440
 was Stalin evil, delusional, or incompetent?

01:20.060 --> 01:22.520
 Evil, delusional, or incompetent.

01:22.520 --> 01:25.540
 Well, you know, evil is one of those words,

01:25.540 --> 01:27.940
 you know, which has a lot of kind of religious

01:27.940 --> 01:30.700
 and moral connotations.

01:30.700 --> 01:33.320
 And, in that sense, yes, I think he was an evil man.

01:33.320 --> 01:36.920
 I mean, he, you know, eliminated people

01:36.920 --> 01:38.760
 absolutely unnecessarily.

01:38.760 --> 01:42.140
 He tortured people, had people tortured.

01:43.040 --> 01:48.040
 He was completely indifferent to the suffering of others.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.080
 He couldn't have carried a wit, you know,

01:51.080 --> 01:54.880
 that millions were suffering.

01:54.880 --> 01:58.600
 And so, yes, I consider him an evil man.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.160
 I mean, you know, historians don't like to.

02:01.160 --> 02:02.000
 Use the word evil.

02:02.000 --> 02:02.840
 Use the word evil.

02:02.840 --> 02:05.380
 It's, you know, it's a word for moral philosophers,

02:05.380 --> 02:10.380
 but I think it certainly fits who he is.

02:11.640 --> 02:14.080
 I think he was delusional.

02:14.080 --> 02:18.000
 And there is a wonderful historian at Princeton,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.680
 a political scientist, actually, named Robert Tucker,

02:20.680 --> 02:25.680
 who said he suffered from a paranoid delusional system.

02:26.480 --> 02:30.360
 And I always remember that of Tucker's writing

02:30.360 --> 02:35.280
 because what Tucker meant is that he was not just paranoid,

02:35.280 --> 02:37.640
 meaning, you know, I'm paranoid.

02:37.640 --> 02:39.960
 I'm worried you're out to get me, right?

02:39.960 --> 02:44.960
 But that he constructed whole plots of people,

02:44.960 --> 02:48.880
 whole systems of people who were out to get him.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.760
 So, in other words, his delusions were that there were

02:51.760 --> 02:54.000
 all of these groups of people out there

02:55.320 --> 02:58.080
 who were out to diminish his power

02:58.080 --> 03:01.840
 and remove him from his position

03:01.840 --> 03:04.840
 and undermine the Soviet Union, in his view.

03:04.840 --> 03:09.840
 So, yes, I think he did suffer from delusions.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.240
 And this had a huge effect,

03:12.240 --> 03:17.240
 because whole groups then were destroyed by his activities,

03:18.160 --> 03:23.160
 which he would construct based on these delusions.

03:23.480 --> 03:24.800
 He was not incompetent.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.760
 He was an extremely competent man.

03:26.760 --> 03:30.040
 I mean, I think most of the research that's gone on,

03:30.040 --> 03:34.080
 especially since the Stalin archive was opened

03:34.080 --> 03:36.040
 at the beginning of the century,

03:36.040 --> 03:38.960
 and I think almost every historian who goes in that archive

03:38.960 --> 03:40.800
 comes away from that archive

03:40.800 --> 03:45.800
 with the feeling of a man who is enormously hardworking,

03:45.800 --> 03:49.880
 intelligent, you know, with an acute sense of politics,

03:49.880 --> 03:54.880
 a really excellent sense of political rhetoric,

03:56.160 --> 04:00.200
 a fantastic editor, you know, in a kind of agitational sense.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.400
 I mean, he's a real agitator, right?

04:02.400 --> 04:07.400
 And of a, you know, a really hard worker.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.560
 I mean, somebody who works from morning till night

04:09.560 --> 04:12.400
 a micromanager in some ways.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.680
 So his competence, I think, was really extreme.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.240
 Now, there were times when that fell down,

04:18.240 --> 04:21.400
 you know, times in the 30s, times in the 20s,

04:21.400 --> 04:24.040
 times during the war where he made mistakes.

04:24.040 --> 04:26.720
 It's not as if he didn't make any mistakes.

04:26.720 --> 04:29.080
 But I think, you know, you look at his stuff,

04:29.080 --> 04:31.920
 you know, you look at his archives, you look what he did.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.560
 I mean, this is an enormously competent man

04:34.560 --> 04:38.560
 who in many, many different areas of his life,

04:38.560 --> 04:42.440
 areas of enterprise, because he, you know,

04:42.440 --> 04:44.840
 he had this notion that he should know everything

04:44.840 --> 04:46.640
 and did know everything.

04:46.640 --> 04:50.880
 I remember one archive, it's called, you know,

04:50.880 --> 04:52.360
 a kind of folder that I looked at

04:52.360 --> 04:56.280
 where he actually went through the wines

04:56.280 --> 04:59.480
 that were produced in his native Georgia

04:59.480 --> 05:03.360
 and wrote down how much they should make

05:03.360 --> 05:05.080
 of each of these wines, you know,

05:05.080 --> 05:10.000
 how many barrels they should produce of these wines,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.160
 which grapes were better than the other grapes,

05:12.160 --> 05:14.280
 sort of correcting, in other words,

05:14.280 --> 05:16.640
 what people were putting down there.

05:16.640 --> 05:20.800
 So he was, you know, his competence ranged very wide,

05:20.800 --> 05:23.440
 or at least he thought his competence ranged very wide.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.680
 I mean, both things, I think, are the case.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.800
 If we look at this paranoid delusional system,

05:27.800 --> 05:29.840
 Stalin was in power for 30 years.

05:29.840 --> 05:34.840
 He is, many argue, one of the most powerful men in history.

05:35.760 --> 05:38.560
 Did, in his case, absolute power corrupt him

05:38.560 --> 05:40.960
 or did it reveal the true nature of the man?

05:40.960 --> 05:43.440
 And maybe just in your sense,

05:43.440 --> 05:45.520
 as we kind of build around this genocide

05:45.520 --> 05:50.280
 of the early 1930s, this paranoid delusional system,

05:50.280 --> 05:52.760
 did it get built up over time?

05:52.760 --> 05:54.560
 Was it always there?

05:54.560 --> 05:59.560
 It's kind of a question of did the genocide,

06:00.240 --> 06:03.200
 was that always inevitable, essentially, in this man,

06:03.200 --> 06:05.880
 or did power create that?

06:05.880 --> 06:08.440
 I mean, it's a great question, and I don't think you can,

06:08.440 --> 06:11.040
 I don't think you can say that it was always

06:12.200 --> 06:14.440
 kind of inherent in the man.

06:14.440 --> 06:18.680
 I mean, the man without his position and without his power,

06:18.680 --> 06:21.000
 you know, wouldn't have been able to accomplish

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
 what he eventually did in the way of murdering people,

06:25.000 --> 06:26.520
 you know, and murdering groups of people,

06:26.520 --> 06:28.800
 which is what genocide is.

06:28.800 --> 06:32.720
 So, you know, I don't, it wasn't sort of in him.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.120
 I mean, there were, and again, you know,

06:34.120 --> 06:36.960
 the new research has shown that, you know,

06:36.960 --> 06:39.520
 he had his childhood was, you know,

06:39.520 --> 06:42.320
 not a particularly nasty one.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.720
 People used to say, you know, the father beat him up,

06:45.720 --> 06:47.480
 and it turns out, actually, it wasn't the father,

06:47.480 --> 06:49.320
 it was the mother once in a while.

06:49.320 --> 06:51.920
 But basically, you know, he was not

06:51.920 --> 06:56.920
 an unusual young Georgian kid or student even.

06:56.960 --> 07:01.040
 And, you know, it was the growth of the Soviet system

07:01.040 --> 07:04.720
 and him within the Soviet system,

07:04.720 --> 07:07.800
 I mean, his own development within the Soviet system,

07:07.800 --> 07:12.800
 I think that led, you know, to the kind of mass killing

07:13.040 --> 07:15.360
 that occurred in the 1930s.

07:15.360 --> 07:19.720
 You know, he essentially achieved complete power

07:19.720 --> 07:22.440
 by the early 1930s.

07:22.440 --> 07:25.640
 And then as he, as he rolled with it,

07:25.640 --> 07:28.200
 as you would say, you know, or people would say,

07:29.200 --> 07:32.800
 you know, it increasingly became murderous.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.680
 And there was no, you know, there were no checks

07:36.680 --> 07:39.800
 and balances, obviously, on that murderous system.

07:39.800 --> 07:43.160
 And not only that, you know, people supported it

07:43.160 --> 07:45.600
 in the NKVD and elsewhere, he learned

07:45.600 --> 07:46.880
 how to manipulate people.

07:46.880 --> 07:51.480
 I mean, he was a superb, you know, political manipulator

07:51.480 --> 07:54.720
 of those people around him.

07:54.720 --> 07:59.720
 And, you know, we have, we've got new transcripts,

08:00.960 --> 08:03.960
 for example, of, you know, police bureau meetings

08:03.960 --> 08:05.920
 in the early 1930s.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.640
 And you read those things and you read, you know,

08:07.640 --> 08:12.640
 he uses humor and he uses sarcasm, especially,

08:12.640 --> 08:17.000
 he uses verbal ways to undermine people, you know,

08:17.000 --> 08:20.600
 to control their behavior and what they do.

08:20.600 --> 08:25.280
 And he's a really, you know, he's a real,

08:25.280 --> 08:27.200
 I guess, manipulator is the right word.

08:27.200 --> 08:31.400
 And he does it, he does it with, you know,

08:31.400 --> 08:35.920
 a kind of skill that on the one hand is admirable.

08:35.920 --> 08:39.760
 And on the other hand, of course, is terrible

08:39.760 --> 08:43.560
 because it ends up, you know, creating the system

08:43.560 --> 08:46.400
 of terror that he creates.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.680
 I mean, I guess just to linger on it,

08:50.680 --> 08:53.120
 I just wonder how much of it is a slippery slope

08:54.160 --> 08:58.600
 in the early 20s, 1920s, did he think he was going

08:58.600 --> 09:00.520
 to be murdering even a single person,

09:00.520 --> 09:04.920
 but thousands and millions?

09:04.920 --> 09:09.920
 I just wonder maybe the murder of a single human being

09:14.080 --> 09:17.760
 just to get them, you know, because you're paranoid

09:17.760 --> 09:19.920
 about them potentially threatening your power,

09:19.920 --> 09:22.240
 does that murder then open a door?

09:22.240 --> 09:23.960
 And once you open the door,

09:23.960 --> 09:25.960
 you become a different human being.

09:25.960 --> 09:29.040
 A deeper question here is the soldier Knitsen,

09:29.040 --> 09:31.040
 you know, the line between good and evil runs

09:31.040 --> 09:34.600
 in every man, are all of us once we commit one murder

09:34.600 --> 09:37.960
 in the situation, does that open a door for all of us?

09:37.960 --> 09:41.760
 And I guess even the further deeper questions,

09:41.760 --> 09:45.400
 how easy it is for human nature to go

09:45.400 --> 09:49.040
 on the slippery slope that ends in genocide?

09:49.040 --> 09:52.400
 There are a lot of questions in those questions.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.920
 And, you know, the slippery slope question

09:55.920 --> 10:00.400
 I would answer, I suppose by saying, you know,

10:00.400 --> 10:04.120
 Stalin wasn't the most likely successor of Lenin,

10:04.120 --> 10:07.880
 there were plenty of others, there were a lot

10:07.880 --> 10:12.680
 of political contingencies that emerged in the 1920s

10:12.680 --> 10:16.680
 that made it possible for Stalin to seize power.

10:16.680 --> 10:19.880
 I don't think of him as, you know,

10:19.880 --> 10:22.880
 if you would just know him in 1925,

10:22.880 --> 10:25.960
 I don't think anybody would say much less himself

10:25.960 --> 10:28.840
 that this was a future mass murderer.

10:28.840 --> 10:32.040
 I mean, Trotsky mistrusted him and thought he was,

10:32.040 --> 10:36.360
 you know, a mindless bureaucrat.

10:36.360 --> 10:39.520
 You know, others were less mistrustful of him,

10:39.520 --> 10:41.760
 but, you know, he managed to gain power

10:41.760 --> 10:43.600
 in the way he did through this bureaucratic

10:43.600 --> 10:47.960
 and political maneuvering that was very successful.

10:49.040 --> 10:52.000
 You know, the slippery slope, as it were,

10:52.000 --> 10:55.600
 doesn't really begin until the 1930s, in my view.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.840
 In other words, once he gains complete power

10:58.840 --> 11:01.360
 and control of the Politburo,

11:01.360 --> 11:05.880
 once the programs that he institutes

11:05.880 --> 11:10.120
 of the Five Year Plan and collectivization go through,

11:10.120 --> 11:14.040
 once he reverses himself and is able to reverse himself

11:14.040 --> 11:17.160
 or reverse the Soviet path, you know,

11:17.160 --> 11:20.560
 to give various nationalities their, you know,

11:20.560 --> 11:22.960
 their ability to develop their own cultures

11:22.960 --> 11:27.960
 and sort of internal politics, once he reverses all that,

11:27.960 --> 11:32.160
 you know, you have the Ukrainian famine in 32, 33,

11:32.160 --> 11:34.400
 you have the murder of Kirov,

11:34.400 --> 11:38.040
 who is one of the leading figures, you know,

11:38.040 --> 11:41.080
 in the political system, you have the suicide of his wife,

11:41.080 --> 11:45.480
 you have all these things come together in 32, 33

11:45.480 --> 11:50.480
 that then, you know, make it more likely,

11:50.600 --> 11:53.920
 in other words, that bad things are gonna happen.

11:53.920 --> 11:57.760
 And people start seeing that, too, around him.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.880
 They start seeing that it's not a slippery slope,

12:00.880 --> 12:05.880
 it's a dangerous, it's a dangerous situation

12:06.160 --> 12:10.000
 which is emerging, and some people really understand that.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.160
 So I don't, I really do see a differentiation

12:13.160 --> 12:14.640
 then between the 20s.

12:14.640 --> 12:17.360
 I mean, it's true that Stalin, during the Civil War,

12:17.360 --> 12:20.120
 there's a lot of, you know, good research on that,

12:21.240 --> 12:24.080
 you know, shows that he already had some of these

12:24.080 --> 12:27.520
 characteristics of being, as it were, murderous

12:27.520 --> 12:32.520
 and being, you know, being dictatorial

12:32.720 --> 12:34.680
 and pushing people around and that sort of thing.

12:34.680 --> 12:38.560
 That was all there, but I don't really see that

12:38.560 --> 12:40.800
 as kind of the necessary stage

12:40.800 --> 12:43.520
 for the next thing that came, which was the 30s,

12:43.520 --> 12:46.800
 which was really terror of the worst sort,

12:46.800 --> 12:49.360
 you know, where everybody's afraid for their lives

12:49.360 --> 12:51.600
 and most people are afraid for their lives

12:51.600 --> 12:54.440
 and their family's lives and where torture

12:54.440 --> 12:57.120
 and that sort of thing becomes a common part,

12:57.120 --> 13:00.360
 you know, of who, what people had to face.

13:00.360 --> 13:03.160
 So it's a different, it's a different world.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.840
 And you know, people will argue,

13:04.840 --> 13:09.840
 they'll argue this kind of Lenin, Stalin continuity debate,

13:10.240 --> 13:11.280
 you know, that's been going on

13:11.280 --> 13:13.120
 since I was an undergraduate, right?

13:13.120 --> 13:16.160
 That argument, you know, was Stalin the natural

13:16.160 --> 13:19.120
 sort of next step from Lenin

13:19.120 --> 13:21.200
 or was he something completely different?

13:23.040 --> 13:24.400
 Many people will argue, you know,

13:24.400 --> 13:27.760
 because of Marxism, Leninism, because of the ideology

13:27.760 --> 13:30.840
 that, you know, it was the natural,

13:30.840 --> 13:32.680
 it was a kind of natural next step.

13:32.680 --> 13:33.960
 I don't think so.

13:33.960 --> 13:36.280
 You know, I would tend to lean the other way.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.240
 Not absolutely.

13:37.240 --> 13:40.120
 I mean, I won't make an absolute argument

13:40.120 --> 13:43.520
 that what Stalin became had nothing to do with Lenin

13:43.520 --> 13:45.560
 and nothing to do with Marxism, Leninism.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.360
 It had a lot to do with it.

13:47.360 --> 13:51.560
 But you know, he takes it one major step further.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.800
 And again, that's why I don't like the slippery slope,

13:53.800 --> 13:54.680
 you know, metaphor,

13:54.680 --> 13:57.240
 because that means it's kind of slow and easy.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.320
 It's a leap.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.480
 And we call, you know, I mean,

14:00.480 --> 14:03.400
 historians talk about the Stalin revolution,

14:03.400 --> 14:05.960
 you know, in 28 and 29, you know,

14:05.960 --> 14:10.960
 that he, in some senses, creates a whole new system,

14:11.200 --> 14:13.400
 you know, through the five year plan,

14:13.400 --> 14:15.760
 collectivization and seizing political power

14:15.760 --> 14:16.720
 the way he does.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.440
 Can you talk about the 1930s?

14:19.440 --> 14:21.680
 Can you describe what happened in Holodomor,

14:21.680 --> 14:23.560
 the Soviet terror famine in Ukraine

14:23.560 --> 14:25.200
 in the 32 and 33?

14:25.200 --> 14:26.040
 Yes.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.200
 That killed millions of Ukrainians.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.040
 Right.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.720
 It's a long story, you know,

14:29.720 --> 14:34.120
 but let me try to be as succinct as I can be.

14:34.120 --> 14:39.120
 I mean, the Holodomor, the terror famine of 32, 33

14:40.160 --> 14:45.160
 comes out of, in part, an all union famine

14:46.120 --> 14:49.800
 that is the result of collectivization.

14:49.800 --> 14:52.200
 You know, collectivization was a catastrophe.

14:52.200 --> 14:56.000
 You know, the more or less, the so called kulaks,

14:56.000 --> 14:57.960
 the more or less richer farmers,

14:57.960 --> 15:00.160
 I mean, they weren't really rich, right?

15:00.160 --> 15:03.160
 Anybody with a tin roof and a cow was considered a kulak,

15:03.160 --> 15:05.040
 you know, and other people who had nothing

15:05.040 --> 15:09.160
 were also considered kulaks if they opposed collectivization.

15:09.160 --> 15:12.360
 So these kulaks, we're talking millions of them, right?

15:12.360 --> 15:15.040
 And Ukraine, it's worth recalling,

15:15.040 --> 15:16.480
 and I'm sure you know this,

15:16.480 --> 15:19.280
 was a, you know, heavily agricultural area,

15:19.280 --> 15:22.520
 and Ukrainian peasants, you know,

15:22.520 --> 15:27.120
 were in the countryside and resisted collectivization

15:27.120 --> 15:32.080
 more than even Russian peasants resisted collectivization,

15:33.120 --> 15:35.480
 suffered during this collectivization program.

15:35.480 --> 15:38.600
 And they, you know, burned sometimes their own houses,

15:38.600 --> 15:40.520
 they killed their own animals,

15:41.480 --> 15:45.120
 they were shot, you know, sometimes on the spot,

15:45.120 --> 15:50.000
 and tens of thousands and others were sent into exile.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.280
 So there was a conflagration in the countryside.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.640
 And the result of that conflagration

15:55.640 --> 15:58.080
 in Ukraine was terrible famine.

15:58.080 --> 16:01.000
 And again, there was famine all over the Soviet Union,

16:01.000 --> 16:04.800
 but it was especially bad in Ukraine,

16:04.800 --> 16:07.880
 in part because Ukrainian peasants resisted.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.680
 Now in 3233, a couple of things happen.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.480
 I mean, I've argued this in my writing,

16:14.480 --> 16:18.160
 and, you know, I've also worked on this,

16:18.160 --> 16:19.960
 I continue to work on it, by the way,

16:19.960 --> 16:24.160
 with a museum in Kiev that's going to be

16:24.160 --> 16:25.840
 about the Holodomor.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.480
 They're building the museum now,

16:27.480 --> 16:32.000
 and it's going to be a very impressive set of exhibits,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.280
 and talk with historians all the time about it.

16:34.280 --> 16:37.360
 So what happens in 3233, a couple of things.

16:37.360 --> 16:41.360
 First of all, the Stalin develops,

16:41.360 --> 16:46.240
 develops an even stronger, I say even stronger,

16:46.240 --> 16:49.240
 because they already had an antipathy for the Ukrainians,

16:49.240 --> 16:53.120
 an even stronger antipathy for the Ukrainians in general.

16:53.120 --> 16:55.920
 First of all, they resist collectivization.

16:55.920 --> 16:59.120
 Second of all, he's not getting all the grain he wants

16:59.120 --> 17:02.000
 out of them, and which he needs.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
 And so he sends in, then, people to expropriate the grain,

17:07.080 --> 17:09.480
 and take the grain away from the peasants.

17:09.480 --> 17:12.840
 These teams of people, you know, some policemen,

17:12.840 --> 17:16.560
 some urban thugs, some party people,

17:16.560 --> 17:19.320
 some poor peasants, you know, take part too,

17:19.320 --> 17:23.880
 go into the villages, and forcibly seize grain

17:23.880 --> 17:28.480
 and animals from the Ukrainian peasantry.

17:28.480 --> 17:29.920
 They're seizing it all over.

17:29.920 --> 17:30.960
 I mean, let's remember again,

17:30.960 --> 17:34.760
 this is all over the Soviet Union, in 32, especially.

17:34.760 --> 17:39.760
 Then, you know, in December of 1932, January of 33,

17:42.360 --> 17:47.360
 February of 33, Stalin has convinced the Ukrainian peasantry

17:49.000 --> 17:51.760
 needs to be shown who's boss,

17:52.960 --> 17:55.600
 that they're not turning over their grain,

17:55.600 --> 17:57.880
 that they're resisting the expropriators,

17:57.880 --> 17:59.120
 that they're hiding the grain,

17:59.120 --> 18:01.480
 which they do sometimes, right?

18:01.480 --> 18:05.560
 That they're basically not loyal to the Soviet Union,

18:05.560 --> 18:07.480
 that they're acting like traitors,

18:07.480 --> 18:10.320
 that they're ready, and he says this, you know,

18:10.320 --> 18:12.560
 I think it's Kaganovich he says it too,

18:12.560 --> 18:14.160
 you know, they're ready to kind of pull out

18:14.160 --> 18:15.840
 of the Soviet Union and join Poland.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.440
 I mean, he thinks Poland is, you know,

18:17.440 --> 18:21.880
 out to get Ukraine, and so he's gonna then,

18:21.880 --> 18:23.960
 essentially, break the back of these peasantry.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.640
 And the way he breaks their back

18:26.880 --> 18:30.480
 is by going through another expropriation program,

18:30.480 --> 18:33.320
 which is not done in the rest of the Soviet Union.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.200
 So he's taking away everything they have,

18:36.200 --> 18:38.240
 everything they have.

18:38.240 --> 18:40.080
 There are new laws introduced,

18:40.080 --> 18:42.680
 where they will actually punish people,

18:42.680 --> 18:47.600
 including kids, with death, if they steal any grain,

18:47.600 --> 18:49.600
 you know, if they take anything from the,

18:49.600 --> 18:51.120
 you know, from the fields.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.680
 So, you know, you can shoot anybody,

18:53.680 --> 18:55.640
 you know, who is looking for food.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.720
 And then he introduces measures in Ukraine,

18:58.720 --> 19:02.120
 which are not introduced into the rest of the Soviet Union.

19:02.120 --> 19:05.200
 For example, the Ukrainian peasantry

19:05.200 --> 19:07.880
 are not allowed to leave their villages anymore.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.120
 They can't go to the city to try to find some things.

19:11.120 --> 19:13.000
 I mean, we've got pictures of, you know,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.880
 Ukrainian peasants dying on the sidewalks

19:15.880 --> 19:19.560
 in Kharkiv, and in Kiev, and places like that,

19:19.560 --> 19:21.240
 who've managed to get out of the village

19:21.240 --> 19:24.040
 and get to the cities, but now they can't leave.

19:24.040 --> 19:28.080
 They can't leave Ukraine to go to Belorussia,

19:28.080 --> 19:32.800
 or Belarus today, or to Russia, you know, to get any food.

19:32.800 --> 19:36.760
 There's no, he won't allow any relief to Ukraine.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.600
 Number of people offer relief, including the Poles,

19:39.600 --> 19:42.120
 but also the Vatican offers relief.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.400
 He won't allow any relief to Ukraine.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.280
 He won't admit that there's a famine in Ukraine.

19:47.280 --> 19:52.280
 And instead, what happens is that Ukraine turns into,

19:52.280 --> 19:58.280
 the Ukrainian countryside turns into what my now past

19:58.280 --> 20:01.120
 colleague who died several years ago, Robert Conquest,

20:01.120 --> 20:04.040
 called a vast Belsen.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.320
 And by that, you know, the image is of bodies

20:06.320 --> 20:10.080
 just lying everywhere, you know, people dead.

20:10.080 --> 20:15.080
 And dying, you know, of hunger, which is, by the way,

20:16.200 --> 20:19.520
 I mean, as you know, I've spent a lot of time

20:19.520 --> 20:21.640
 studying genocide, I don't think there's anything worse

20:21.640 --> 20:24.080
 than dying of hunger from what I have read.

20:24.080 --> 20:27.160
 I mean, you see terrible ways that people die, right?

20:27.160 --> 20:31.200
 But dying of hunger is just such a horrible, horrible thing.

20:31.200 --> 20:35.680
 And so, for example, we know there were many cases

20:35.680 --> 20:37.240
 of cannibalism in the countryside

20:37.240 --> 20:38.760
 because there wasn't anything to eat.

20:38.760 --> 20:41.800
 People were eating their own kids, right?

20:41.800 --> 20:43.120
 And Stalin knew about this.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.840
 And again, you know, we started with this question

20:45.840 --> 20:47.920
 a little bit earlier, he doesn't,

20:47.920 --> 20:52.920
 there's not a sign of remorse, not a sign of pity, right?

20:54.360 --> 20:58.960
 Not a sign of any kind of human emotion

20:58.960 --> 21:01.680
 that normal people would have.

21:01.680 --> 21:06.680
 What about the opposite of joy for teaching them a lesson?

21:08.280 --> 21:09.560
 I don't think there's joy.

21:09.560 --> 21:12.880
 I'm not sure Stalin really understood

21:12.880 --> 21:15.120
 emotion, what joy was, you know.

21:15.120 --> 21:20.120
 I think he felt it was necessary to get those SOBs, right?

21:21.920 --> 21:23.680
 That they deserved it.

21:23.680 --> 21:26.720
 He says that several times, this is their own fault, right?

21:26.720 --> 21:27.920
 This is their own fault.

21:29.480 --> 21:32.360
 And as their own fault, you know,

21:32.360 --> 21:36.000
 they get what they deserve, basically.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.400
 How much was the calculation?

21:37.400 --> 21:39.920
 How much was it reason versus emotion?

21:39.920 --> 21:44.920
 In terms of, you said he was competent.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.600
 Was there a long term strategy

21:47.600 --> 21:51.520
 or was this strategy based on emotion and anger?

21:51.520 --> 21:56.400
 No, I think actually the right answer is a little of both.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.200
 I mean, usually the right answer in history

21:58.200 --> 21:59.040
 is something like that.

21:59.040 --> 21:59.880
 A little of both?

21:59.880 --> 22:01.360
 No, you can't, you can't.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.920
 It wasn't just, I mean, first of all,

22:03.920 --> 22:08.600
 you know, the Soviets had it in for Ukraine

22:08.600 --> 22:12.080
 and Ukrainian nationalism, which they really didn't like.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.640
 And by the way, Russians still don't like it, right?

22:15.760 --> 22:18.040
 So they had it in for Ukrainian nationalism.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.880
 They feared Ukrainian nationalism.

22:22.280 --> 22:24.760
 As I said, you know, Stalin writes, you know,

22:24.760 --> 22:29.400
 we'll lose Ukraine, you know, if these guys win.

22:29.400 --> 22:33.240
 You know, so there's a kind of long term determination,

22:34.120 --> 22:37.240
 as I said, you know, to kind of break the back

22:37.240 --> 22:42.240
 of Ukrainian national identity and Ukrainian nationalism

22:43.160 --> 22:46.840
 as any kind of separatist force whatsoever.

22:46.840 --> 22:50.040
 And so there's that rational calculation.

22:50.040 --> 22:52.600
 At the same time, I think Stalin is annoyed

22:53.560 --> 22:58.560
 and peeved and angry on one level

22:59.560 --> 23:02.880
 with the Ukrainians for resisting collectivization

23:02.880 --> 23:07.880
 and for being difficult and for not conforming, you know,

23:08.040 --> 23:13.040
 to the way he thinks peasants should act in this situation.

23:13.240 --> 23:14.480
 So you have both things.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.600
 He's also very angry at the Ukrainian party

23:17.600 --> 23:20.160
 and eventually purges it for not being able

23:20.160 --> 23:23.880
 to control Ukraine and not be able to control the situation.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.440
 You know, Ukraine is in theory the bread basket, right?

23:26.440 --> 23:27.280
 Of Europe.

23:27.280 --> 23:30.280
 Well, how come the bread basket isn't turning over to me

23:30.280 --> 23:32.200
 all this grain so I can sell it abroad

23:32.200 --> 23:35.160
 and, you know, build new factories

23:35.160 --> 23:37.520
 and support the workers in the cities?

23:37.520 --> 23:39.600
 So there's a kind of annoyance.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.720
 You know, when things fail,

23:41.720 --> 23:43.720
 and this is absolutely typical of Stalin,

23:43.720 --> 23:45.920
 when things fail, he blames it on other people

23:45.920 --> 23:47.720
 and usually groups of people, right?

23:47.720 --> 23:49.960
 Not individuals, but groups again.

23:50.920 --> 23:53.660
 So a little bit of both I think is the right answer.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.720
 This blame, it feels like there's a playbook

23:57.720 --> 23:59.560
 that dictators follow.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.360
 I just wonder if it comes naturally

24:01.360 --> 24:03.000
 or just kind of evolves.

24:03.960 --> 24:05.680
 Because, you know, blaming others

24:05.680 --> 24:06.960
 and then telling these narratives

24:06.960 --> 24:08.340
 and then creating the other

24:08.340 --> 24:10.700
 and then somehow that leads to hatred and genocide.

24:10.700 --> 24:14.720
 It feels like there's too many commonalities

24:14.720 --> 24:18.960
 for it not to be a naturally emergent strategy

24:18.960 --> 24:20.680
 that works for dictatorships.

24:20.680 --> 24:23.080
 I mean, it's a very good point.

24:23.080 --> 24:27.680
 And I think it's one, you know, that has its merits.

24:27.680 --> 24:30.400
 In other words, I think you're right

24:30.400 --> 24:32.220
 that there's certain kinds of strategies

24:32.220 --> 24:35.540
 by dictators that, you know, are common to them.

24:35.540 --> 24:37.880
 A lot of them do killing, not all of them

24:37.880 --> 24:40.060
 of that sort that Stalin did.

24:40.060 --> 24:43.840
 I've written about Mao and Pol Pot, you know, and Hitler.

24:43.840 --> 24:46.840
 And, you know, there is a sort of, as you say,

24:46.840 --> 24:51.780
 a kind of playbook for political dictatorship.

24:51.780 --> 24:56.540
 Also for, you know, a kind of communist totalitarian way

24:56.540 --> 24:59.080
 of functioning, you know?

24:59.080 --> 25:01.520
 And that way of functioning was described already

25:01.520 --> 25:02.960
 by Hannah Arendt early on

25:02.960 --> 25:05.440
 when she wrote The Origins of Totalitarianism.

25:06.360 --> 25:10.280
 And she more or less writes the playbook

25:10.280 --> 25:12.760
 and Stalin does follow it.

25:12.760 --> 25:17.200
 The real question, it seems to me, is to what extent,

25:17.200 --> 25:19.780
 you know, and how deep does this go

25:19.780 --> 25:22.220
 and how often does it go in that direction?

25:22.220 --> 25:25.040
 I mean, you can argue, for example,

25:25.040 --> 25:27.520
 I mean, Fidel Castro was not a nice man, right?

25:27.520 --> 25:29.860
 He was a dictator, he was a terrible dictator.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.280
 But he did not engage in mass murder.

25:33.280 --> 25:36.760
 Ho Chi Minh was a dictator, a communist dictator

25:36.760 --> 25:39.800
 who grew up, you know, in the communist movement,

25:39.800 --> 25:43.360
 went to Moscow, you know, spent time in Moscow in the 30s

25:43.360 --> 25:47.720
 and went to find, found the Vietnamese Communist Party.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.240
 You know, he was a horrible dictator.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.460
 I'm sure he was responsible

25:50.460 --> 25:52.580
 for a lot of death and destruction.

25:52.580 --> 25:55.120
 But he wasn't a mass murderer.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.920
 And so you get those, you know.

25:57.920 --> 26:02.000
 I mean, I would even argue, others will disagree,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.120
 that Lenin wasn't a mass murderer.

26:04.120 --> 26:06.660
 You know, that he didn't kill the same way,

26:06.660 --> 26:08.200
 you know, that Stalin killed.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.840
 Or people after him, they're communist dictators too,

26:10.840 --> 26:13.560
 after all, Khrushchev, you know, was a communist dictator.

26:13.560 --> 26:14.960
 But he stopped this killing.

26:16.320 --> 26:19.080
 And, you know, he's still responsible for a gulag

26:19.080 --> 26:22.000
 and people sent off into a gulag and imprisonment

26:22.000 --> 26:23.800
 and torture and that sort of thing.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.400
 But it's not at all the same thing.

26:25.400 --> 26:29.800
 So there are some, you know, like Stalin, like Mao,

26:29.800 --> 26:32.680
 like Pol Pot, you know, who commit these horrible,

26:32.680 --> 26:36.960
 horrible atrocities, extensively engaging,

26:36.960 --> 26:39.800
 in my view, in genocide.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.100
 And there are some who don't.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.680
 And, you know, what's the difference?

26:44.680 --> 26:47.680
 Well, you know, the difference is partly in personality,

26:47.680 --> 26:50.400
 partly in historical circumstance, you know,

26:50.400 --> 26:54.200
 partly in who is it that controls the reins of power.

26:54.200 --> 26:57.040
 How much do you connect the ideas of communism

26:57.040 --> 27:02.040
 or Marxism or socialism to Holodomor, to Stalin's rule?

27:03.080 --> 27:05.640
 So how naturally, as you kind of alluded to,

27:05.640 --> 27:08.480
 does it lead to genocide?

27:09.780 --> 27:13.220
 That's also, I mean, in some ways,

27:13.220 --> 27:14.800
 I've just addressed that question by saying

27:14.800 --> 27:17.100
 it doesn't always lead to genocide.

27:17.100 --> 27:18.980
 You know, in the case, again, you know,

27:18.980 --> 27:23.080
 Cuba is not pretty, but it didn't have,

27:23.080 --> 27:25.040
 there was no genocide in Cuba.

27:25.040 --> 27:26.640
 And same thing in North Vietnam.

27:27.800 --> 27:30.720
 You know, even North Korea, as awful as it is,

27:30.720 --> 27:32.480
 is a terrible dictatorship, right?

27:32.480 --> 27:37.480
 And people's rights are totally destroyed, right?

27:37.560 --> 27:39.880
 They have no freedom whatsoever.

27:39.880 --> 27:43.580
 You know, it's not, as far as we know, genocidal.

27:43.580 --> 27:45.120
 Who knows whether it could be

27:45.120 --> 27:47.000
 or whether if they took over South Korea,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.080
 you know, mass murder wouldn't take place

27:49.080 --> 27:50.200
 and that kind of thing.

27:50.200 --> 27:53.240
 But my point is, is that the ideology

27:53.240 --> 27:57.120
 doesn't necessarily dictate genocide.

27:57.120 --> 27:59.680
 In other words, it's an ideology, I think,

27:59.680 --> 28:04.200
 that makes genocide sometimes too easily possible

28:05.520 --> 28:09.200
 given, you know, the way it thinks through history

28:09.200 --> 28:11.600
 as being, you know, you're on the right side of history

28:11.600 --> 28:13.800
 and some people are on the wrong side of history

28:13.800 --> 28:15.640
 and you have to destroy those people

28:15.640 --> 28:17.080
 who are on the wrong side of history.

28:17.080 --> 28:21.040
 I mean, there is something in, you know, Marxism, Leninism,

28:21.040 --> 28:23.840
 which, you know, has that kind of language

28:23.840 --> 28:25.520
 and that kind of thinking.

28:25.520 --> 28:30.520
 But I don't think it's necessarily that way.

28:31.500 --> 28:34.140
 There's a wonderful historian at Berkeley

28:34.140 --> 28:37.680
 named Martin Malia who has written, you know,

28:37.680 --> 28:39.640
 wrote a number of books on this subject

28:39.640 --> 28:43.840
 and he was very, very, he was convinced

28:43.840 --> 28:48.840
 that the ideology itself, you know,

28:49.680 --> 28:53.080
 played a crucial role in the murderousness

28:53.080 --> 28:54.660
 of the Soviet regime.

28:54.660 --> 28:56.840
 I'm not completely convinced.

28:56.840 --> 28:58.600
 You know, when I say not completely convinced,

28:58.600 --> 29:01.640
 I think you could argue it different ways.

29:01.640 --> 29:05.680
 Equally valid, you know, with equally valid arguments.

29:05.680 --> 29:10.680
 I mean, there's something about the ideology of communism

29:10.680 --> 29:15.200
 that allows you to decrease the value of human life.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.560
 Almost like this philosophy, if it's okay to crack

29:17.560 --> 29:19.680
 a few eggs to make an omelet.

29:19.680 --> 29:23.040
 So maybe that, if you can reason like that,

29:23.040 --> 29:26.240
 then it's easier to take the leap of,

29:26.240 --> 29:28.460
 for the good of the country, for the good of the people,

29:28.460 --> 29:31.620
 for the good of the world, it's okay to kill a few people.

29:31.620 --> 29:36.620
 And then that's where, I wonder about the slippery slope.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.640
 Yeah, no, no, again, you know,

29:38.640 --> 29:40.240
 I don't think it's a slippery slope.

29:40.240 --> 29:44.080
 I think it's, I think it's dangerous.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.700
 In other words, I think it's dangerous,

29:45.700 --> 29:48.660
 but I don't consider, you know,

29:48.660 --> 29:51.680
 I don't like Marxism, Leninism any better than the next guy.

29:51.680 --> 29:53.520
 And I've lived in plenty of those systems

29:53.520 --> 29:56.640
 to know how they can beat people down

29:56.640 --> 29:59.480
 and how they can, you know,

30:01.340 --> 30:03.280
 destroy human aspirations

30:03.280 --> 30:06.500
 and human interaction between people.

30:06.500 --> 30:11.500
 But they're not necessarily murderous systems.

30:11.840 --> 30:15.600
 They are systems that contain people's autonomy,

30:15.600 --> 30:20.000
 that force people into work and labor and lifestyles

30:20.000 --> 30:21.820
 that they don't want to live.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.680
 I spent a lot of time, you know,

30:23.680 --> 30:27.620
 with East Germans and Poles, you know,

30:27.620 --> 30:30.900
 who lived in, and even in the Soviet Union,

30:32.120 --> 30:34.200
 you know, in the post Stalin period,

30:34.200 --> 30:37.120
 where people lived lives they didn't want to live,

30:37.120 --> 30:40.660
 you know, and didn't have the freedom to choose.

30:40.660 --> 30:44.040
 And that was terrifying in and of itself,

30:44.040 --> 30:46.560
 but these were not murderous systems.

30:46.560 --> 30:51.480
 And they, you know, ascribed to Marxism, Leninism.

30:51.480 --> 30:54.200
 So I suppose it's important to draw the line

30:54.200 --> 30:58.480
 between mass murder and genocide and mass murder

30:58.480 --> 31:02.680
 versus just mass violation of human rights.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.920
 Right, right.

31:04.920 --> 31:08.780
 And the leap to mass murder, you're saying,

31:10.700 --> 31:13.240
 maybe easier in some ideologies than others,

31:13.240 --> 31:15.960
 but it's not clear that somehow one ideology

31:15.960 --> 31:17.520
 definitely leads to mass murder and not.

31:17.520 --> 31:18.360
 Exactly.

31:18.360 --> 31:21.080
 I wonder how many factors, what factors,

31:21.080 --> 31:24.000
 how much of it is a single charismatic leader?

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
 How much of it is the conflagration

31:28.000 --> 31:30.640
 of multiple historical events?

31:30.640 --> 31:35.060
 How much of it is just dumb, the opposite of luck?

31:38.240 --> 31:40.680
 Do you have a sense where if you look at a moment

31:40.680 --> 31:45.680
 in history, predict, looking at the factors,

31:46.840 --> 31:49.520
 whether something bad's going to happen here?

31:49.520 --> 31:52.440
 When you look at Iraq at when Saddam Hussein

31:52.440 --> 31:55.840
 first took power, well, you could,

31:55.840 --> 31:58.680
 or you can, you know, go even farther back in history,

31:58.680 --> 32:00.240
 would you be able to predict?

32:00.240 --> 32:02.200
 So you said, you already kind of answered that

32:02.200 --> 32:04.640
 with Stalin saying there's no way you could have predicted

32:04.640 --> 32:07.000
 that in the early 20s.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
 Is that always the case?

32:08.000 --> 32:09.280
 You basically can't predict.

32:09.280 --> 32:11.080
 It's pretty much always the case.

32:11.080 --> 32:14.960
 In other words, I mean, history is a wonderful,

32:14.960 --> 32:17.480
 you know, discipline and way of looking at life

32:17.480 --> 32:21.880
 and the world in retrospect, meaning it happened.

32:21.880 --> 32:23.040
 It happened.

32:23.040 --> 32:24.960
 And we know it happened.

32:24.960 --> 32:28.600
 And it's too easy to say sometimes it happened

32:28.600 --> 32:30.720
 because it had to happen that way.

32:30.720 --> 32:33.840
 It almost never has to happen that way.

32:33.840 --> 32:35.580
 And, you know, things.

32:36.760 --> 32:41.760
 So I very much am of the school that emphasizes,

32:43.560 --> 32:48.020
 you know, contingency and choice and difference

32:48.020 --> 32:50.480
 and different paths and not, you know,

32:50.480 --> 32:54.940
 not necessarily a path that has to be followed.

32:54.940 --> 32:59.900
 And those, you know, and, you know,

32:59.900 --> 33:02.900
 sometimes you can warn about things.

33:02.900 --> 33:06.100
 I mean, you can think, well, something's going to happen.

33:06.100 --> 33:08.420
 And usually the way it works,

33:08.420 --> 33:09.620
 let me just give you one example.

33:09.620 --> 33:11.580
 I mean, I'm thinking about an example right now,

33:11.580 --> 33:13.280
 which was the war in Yugoslavia, you know,

33:13.280 --> 33:16.180
 which came in the 1990s and eventually

33:16.180 --> 33:18.400
 ventuated in genocide in Bosnia.

33:19.780 --> 33:23.180
 And, you know, I remember very clearly, you know,

33:23.180 --> 33:25.780
 the 1970s and 1980s in Yugoslavia,

33:25.780 --> 33:28.260
 and people would say, you know, there's trouble here

33:28.260 --> 33:31.260
 and, you know, something could go wrong.

33:31.260 --> 33:33.900
 But no one in their wildest imagination

33:33.900 --> 33:36.860
 thought that there would be outright war between them all.

33:36.860 --> 33:39.300
 Then the outright war happened, genocide happened,

33:39.300 --> 33:41.940
 and afterwards people would say, I saw it coming.

33:42.860 --> 33:44.580
 You know, so you get a lot of that,

33:45.700 --> 33:48.820
 especially with pundits and journalists,

33:48.820 --> 33:51.040
 and that's, I saw it coming, I knew it was happening.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.620
 You know, well, I mean, what happens in the human mind,

33:53.620 --> 33:54.980
 and it happens in your mind too,

33:54.980 --> 33:58.180
 is, you know, you go through a lot of alternatives.

33:58.180 --> 34:00.460
 I mean, think about January 6th, you know, in this country,

34:00.460 --> 34:02.140
 and all the different alternatives

34:03.300 --> 34:05.020
 which people had in their mind,

34:05.020 --> 34:10.020
 or before January 6th, you know, after the lost election.

34:10.480 --> 34:13.180
 You know, things could have gone in lots of different ways,

34:13.180 --> 34:14.580
 and there were all kinds of people

34:14.580 --> 34:16.300
 choosing different ways it could have gone,

34:16.300 --> 34:20.020
 but nobody really knew how it was going to turn out.

34:20.020 --> 34:22.020
 It wasn't as smart people really understood

34:22.020 --> 34:24.260
 that there'd be this kind of cockamamie uprising

34:24.260 --> 34:26.980
 on January 6th, you know, that almost,

34:26.980 --> 34:28.980
 you know, caused us enormous grief.

34:28.980 --> 34:31.640
 So all of these kinds of things in history,

34:31.640 --> 34:33.620
 you know, are deeply contingent.

34:33.620 --> 34:37.320
 They depend on, you know, factors that we cannot predict,

34:37.320 --> 34:41.380
 and, you know, and it's the joy of history that it's open.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.500
 You know, you think about how people are now,

34:43.500 --> 34:45.020
 I mean, let me give you one more example,

34:45.020 --> 34:47.460
 and then I'll shut up, but, you know,

34:47.460 --> 34:49.700
 there's the environmental example.

34:49.700 --> 34:51.020
 You know, we're all threatened, right?

34:51.020 --> 34:51.940
 We know it's coming.

34:51.940 --> 34:54.440
 We know there's trouble, right?

34:54.440 --> 34:58.260
 We know there's gonna be a catastrophe at some point,

34:58.260 --> 34:59.260
 but when?

34:59.260 --> 35:00.980
 What's the catastrophe?

35:00.980 --> 35:02.380
 Yeah, what's the nature of the catastrophe?

35:02.380 --> 35:03.220
 Everyone says catastrophe.

35:03.220 --> 35:04.060
 And what's the nature of it, right, right, right.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.380
 Is it gonna be wars because resource constraint?

35:06.380 --> 35:07.400
 Is it going to be hunger?

35:07.400 --> 35:10.780
 Is it gonna be, like, mass migration of different kinds

35:10.780 --> 35:13.260
 that leads to some kind of conflict and immigration,

35:13.260 --> 35:16.320
 and maybe it won't be that big of a deal,

35:16.320 --> 35:19.020
 and a total other catastrophic event

35:19.020 --> 35:21.180
 will completely challenge the entirety

35:21.180 --> 35:22.220
 of the human civilization.

35:22.220 --> 35:25.120
 That's my point, that's my point, that's my point.

35:25.980 --> 35:28.100
 You know, we really don't know.

35:28.100 --> 35:29.700
 I mean, there's a lot we do know.

35:29.700 --> 35:32.060
 I mean, the warming business and all this kind of stuff,

35:32.060 --> 35:34.260
 you know, it's scientifically there,

35:34.260 --> 35:36.540
 but how it's going to play out.

35:36.540 --> 35:39.700
 And everybody's saying, you know, different things.

35:39.700 --> 35:42.980
 And then you get somewhere in 50 years or 60 years,

35:42.980 --> 35:45.500
 which I won't see, and people say, aha,

35:45.500 --> 35:47.060
 I told you it was gonna be X,

35:47.060 --> 35:49.420
 or it was gonna be Y, or it was gonna be Z.

35:49.420 --> 35:52.100
 So I just don't think in history you can,

35:54.620 --> 35:56.360
 well, you can't predict.

35:56.360 --> 35:59.020
 You simply cannot predict what's going to happen.

35:59.020 --> 36:02.260
 It's kind of when you just look at Hitler in the 30s,

36:02.260 --> 36:07.140
 for me, oftentimes when I kind of read different accounts,

36:07.140 --> 36:09.100
 it is so often, certainly in the press,

36:09.100 --> 36:11.880
 but in general, me just reading about Hitler,

36:11.880 --> 36:15.020
 I get the sense, like, this is a clown.

36:15.020 --> 36:18.420
 There's no way this person will gain power.

36:18.420 --> 36:20.260
 Which one, Hitler or Stalin?

36:20.260 --> 36:21.420
 Hitler, Hitler.

36:21.420 --> 36:23.260
 No, no, no, with Stalin, you don't get a sense

36:23.260 --> 36:26.060
 he's a clown, he's a really good executive.

36:26.060 --> 36:28.540
 You think, you don't think it'll lead to mass murder,

36:28.540 --> 36:32.460
 but you think he's going to build a giant bureaucracy,

36:32.460 --> 36:37.260
 at least with Hitler, it's like a failed artist

36:37.260 --> 36:39.500
 who keeps screaming about stuff.

36:39.500 --> 36:42.380
 There's no way he's gonna, I mean,

36:42.380 --> 36:44.820
 you certainly don't think about the atrocities,

36:44.820 --> 36:47.580
 but there's no way he's going to gain power,

36:47.580 --> 36:48.860
 especially against communism.

36:48.860 --> 36:50.620
 There's so many other competing forces

36:50.620 --> 36:54.220
 that could have easily beat him.

36:54.220 --> 36:58.900
 But then, you realize, event after event,

36:58.900 --> 37:00.380
 where this clown keeps dancing,

37:00.380 --> 37:02.900
 and all of a sudden, he gains more and more power,

37:02.900 --> 37:04.940
 and just certain moments in time,

37:04.940 --> 37:09.940
 he makes strategic decisions in terms of cooperating

37:11.500 --> 37:13.180
 or gaining power over the military,

37:13.180 --> 37:16.300
 all those kinds of things that eventually

37:16.300 --> 37:17.300
 give him the power.

37:17.300 --> 37:21.500
 I mean, this clown is one of the most impactful

37:21.500 --> 37:25.260
 in the negative sense human beings in history.

37:25.260 --> 37:27.980
 Right, and even the Jews who are there

37:27.980 --> 37:30.580
 and are being screamed at and discriminated against,

37:30.580 --> 37:33.860
 and there's a series of measures taken against them

37:33.860 --> 37:36.460
 incrementally during the course of the 1930s,

37:37.420 --> 37:39.020
 and very few who leave.

37:39.020 --> 37:40.660
 Yeah, I mean, some pick up and go and say,

37:40.660 --> 37:44.580
 I'm getting the hell out of here, and some Zionists

37:44.580 --> 37:46.820
 try to leave, too, and go to the United States and stuff,

37:46.820 --> 37:51.620
 but go to Israel and Palestine at the time,

37:51.620 --> 37:55.540
 but, or to Britain or France.

37:55.540 --> 37:59.020
 But in general, even the Jews who should have been

37:59.020 --> 38:01.460
 very sensitive to what was going on

38:01.460 --> 38:06.100
 didn't really understand the extent of the danger,

38:06.100 --> 38:08.740
 and it's really hard for people to do that.

38:08.740 --> 38:12.060
 It's almost impossible, in fact, I think.

38:12.060 --> 38:15.060
 So most of the time, in that exact situation,

38:16.860 --> 38:18.340
 nothing would have happened,

38:18.340 --> 38:20.220
 or there'd be some drama and so on,

38:20.220 --> 38:22.240
 and it'd be there's some bureaucrat,

38:22.240 --> 38:23.860
 but every once in a while in human history,

38:23.860 --> 38:25.900
 there's a kind of turn,

38:25.900 --> 38:28.740
 and maybe something catalyzes something else,

38:28.740 --> 38:31.060
 and just it accelerates to accelerate,

38:31.060 --> 38:34.060
 escalates, escalates, and then war breaks out,

38:34.060 --> 38:37.820
 or totally, you know, revolutions break out.

38:37.820 --> 38:38.660
 Right.

38:40.180 --> 38:43.580
 Can we go to the big question of genocide?

38:43.580 --> 38:44.860
 What is genocide?

38:44.860 --> 38:47.460
 What are the defining characteristics of genocide?

38:48.380 --> 38:50.580
 Dealing with genocide is a difficult thing

38:50.580 --> 38:52.320
 when it comes to the definition.

38:53.540 --> 38:58.540
 There is a definition, the December 1948 UN Convention

38:58.540 --> 39:02.220
 on the Prep Prevention and Punishment of Genocide

39:02.220 --> 39:07.220
 is considered the sort of major document of definition,

39:07.220 --> 39:09.700
 in the definitional sense of genocide,

39:09.700 --> 39:14.700
 and it emphasizes the intentional destruction

39:16.460 --> 39:21.460
 of an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group,

39:22.100 --> 39:26.660
 those are the four groups, again, comma, as such.

39:26.660 --> 39:27.900
 And what that means, basically,

39:27.900 --> 39:31.900
 is destroying the group as a group.

39:31.900 --> 39:36.700
 In other words, there's a kind of beauty in human diversity,

39:36.700 --> 39:39.580
 and different groups of people, you know,

39:39.580 --> 39:43.500
 Estonians, you know, a tribe of Native Americans,

39:43.500 --> 39:48.500
 South African tribes, you know, the Rohingya in Myanmar,

39:48.880 --> 39:52.180
 there's a kind of beauty humanity recognizes

39:52.180 --> 39:55.360
 in the distinctiveness of those groups.

39:55.360 --> 39:58.060
 You know, this was a notion that emerges really

39:58.060 --> 40:00.920
 with Romanticism after the French Revolution,

40:00.920 --> 40:03.280
 then the beginning of the 19th century,

40:03.280 --> 40:04.500
 with Herder, mostly.

40:04.500 --> 40:07.000
 And this beauty of these groups, then,

40:08.260 --> 40:12.540
 you know, is what is under attack in genocide.

40:13.840 --> 40:16.100
 And it's with intent, you know,

40:16.100 --> 40:19.840
 the idea is that it's intentional destruction.

40:19.840 --> 40:23.180
 So this is a kind of, you know,

40:23.180 --> 40:25.860
 analogy to first degree, second degree,

40:25.860 --> 40:27.100
 and third degree murder, right?

40:27.100 --> 40:28.280
 First degree murder, you know,

40:28.280 --> 40:31.220
 you're out to kill this person, and you plan it,

40:31.220 --> 40:34.180
 and you go out, and you do it, right?

40:34.180 --> 40:36.100
 That's intent, right?

40:36.100 --> 40:37.780
 Manslaughter is not intent.

40:37.780 --> 40:40.980
 You end up doing the same thing, but it's different.

40:40.980 --> 40:45.980
 So, you know, the major person behind the definitions,

40:46.700 --> 40:49.620
 a man named Raphael Lemkin, I don't know if you heard

40:49.620 --> 40:53.540
 his name or not, but he was a Polish Jewish jurist

40:53.540 --> 40:55.980
 who came, you know, from Poland,

40:55.980 --> 40:58.340
 came to the United States during the war,

40:58.340 --> 41:03.340
 and had been a kind of crusader for recognizing genocide.

41:05.780 --> 41:08.620
 It's a word that he created, by the way,

41:08.620 --> 41:11.300
 and he coined the term in 1943,

41:11.300 --> 41:14.940
 and then published it in 1944 for the first time.

41:14.940 --> 41:18.060
 Geno, meaning people, and side, meaning killing, right?

41:18.060 --> 41:20.900
 And so Lemkin then had this term,

41:20.900 --> 41:23.420
 and he pushed hard to have it recognized,

41:23.420 --> 41:24.940
 and it was in the UN Convention.

41:24.940 --> 41:27.340
 So that's the rough definition.

41:27.340 --> 41:30.500
 The problem with it is the definition,

41:30.500 --> 41:33.020
 the problems with the definition are several.

41:33.940 --> 41:38.460
 You know, one of them is, is it just these four groups?

41:38.460 --> 41:42.340
 You know, racial, religious, ethnic, or national?

41:42.340 --> 41:44.620
 See, this comes right out of the war.

41:44.620 --> 41:48.740
 And what's in people's minds in 1948 are Jews,

41:48.740 --> 41:51.740
 Poles, Russians, Yugoslavs sometimes,

41:51.740 --> 41:53.060
 who were killed by the Nazis.

41:53.060 --> 41:54.580
 That's what's in their mind.

41:54.580 --> 41:56.980
 But there are other groups, too, if you think about it,

41:56.980 --> 41:58.900
 you know, who are killed,

41:58.900 --> 42:01.380
 social groups or political groups.

42:01.380 --> 42:05.220
 And that was not allowed in the convention,

42:05.220 --> 42:07.900
 meaning for a lot of different reasons,

42:07.900 --> 42:10.740
 the Soviets were primary among them.

42:10.740 --> 42:12.820
 They didn't want other kinds of groups,

42:12.820 --> 42:16.620
 let's say Kulaks, for example, to be considered.

42:16.620 --> 42:18.620
 That's a social group.

42:18.620 --> 42:21.500
 Or peasants, which is a social group.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.140
 So, or a political group.

42:23.140 --> 42:28.140
 I mean, let's take a group, you know, communists killed

42:28.580 --> 42:31.900
 groups of people, but non communists also killed

42:31.900 --> 42:35.780
 groups of people in Indonesia in 1965, 66, they killed,

42:35.780 --> 42:37.100
 you know, I don't know exactly,

42:37.100 --> 42:40.100
 but roughly 600,000 Indonesian communists.

42:40.100 --> 42:42.500
 Well, is that genocide or not?

42:42.500 --> 42:45.260
 You know, at my point of view, it is genocide,

42:45.260 --> 42:48.460
 although it's Indonesians killing Indonesians.

42:48.460 --> 42:51.060
 And we have the same problem with the Cambodian genocide.

42:51.060 --> 42:53.860
 I mean, we talk about a Cambodian genocide,

42:53.860 --> 42:56.940
 but most of the people killed in the Cambodian genocide

42:56.940 --> 42:58.620
 were other Cambodians.

42:58.620 --> 43:01.140
 They give it the name, they're ready to recognize

43:01.140 --> 43:04.340
 this genocide because they also killed some other peoples,

43:04.340 --> 43:08.060
 meaning the Vietnamese, Aham people who are,

43:08.060 --> 43:13.060
 you know, Muslim, smaller Muslim people in the area,

43:13.300 --> 43:14.700
 and a few others.

43:14.700 --> 43:18.100
 So the question then becomes, well,

43:18.100 --> 43:20.300
 does it have to be a different nationality

43:20.300 --> 43:23.140
 or ethnic group or religious group for it to be genocide?

43:23.140 --> 43:24.780
 And my answer is no.

43:24.780 --> 43:26.460
 You know, you need to expand the definition.

43:26.460 --> 43:28.100
 It's a little bit like with our constitution.

43:28.100 --> 43:30.460
 We got a constitution, but we don't live

43:30.460 --> 43:32.060
 in the end of the 18th century, right?

43:32.060 --> 43:33.660
 We live in the 21st century.

43:33.660 --> 43:36.660
 And so you have to update the constitution

43:36.660 --> 43:38.340
 over the centuries.

43:38.340 --> 43:42.700
 And similarly, the genocide convention needs updating too.

43:42.700 --> 43:45.140
 So that's how I work with the definition.

43:45.140 --> 43:48.060
 So this is this invention.

43:48.060 --> 43:51.060
 Was it an invention, this beautiful idea,

43:51.060 --> 43:53.540
 romantic idea that there's groups of people

43:53.540 --> 43:57.660
 and the group is united by some unique characteristics?

43:57.660 --> 44:01.620
 That was an invention in human history, this idea?

44:01.620 --> 44:03.460
 Not to see as individuals?

44:03.460 --> 44:05.180
 In some senses, it was.

44:05.180 --> 44:06.740
 I mean, it's not, you know,

44:06.740 --> 44:09.380
 there are things that are always constructed

44:09.380 --> 44:12.940
 in one fashion or another and the construction,

44:12.940 --> 44:15.860
 you know, more or less represents the reality.

44:15.860 --> 44:18.540
 And what the reality is always much more complicated

44:18.540 --> 44:21.940
 than the construction or the invention of a term

44:21.940 --> 44:26.420
 or a concept or a way of thinking about a nation, right?

44:26.420 --> 44:29.740
 And this way of thinking of nations, you know,

44:29.740 --> 44:34.740
 as again, you know, groups of religious, linguistic,

44:37.900 --> 44:42.300
 not political necessarily, but cultural entities

44:42.300 --> 44:45.500
 is something that was essentially invented, yes.

44:45.500 --> 44:47.460
 Yeah, so I mean, you know, if you look at...

44:47.460 --> 44:50.380
 There are no Germans in the 17th century.

44:50.380 --> 44:52.740
 There are no Italians in the 17th century, right?

44:52.740 --> 44:54.860
 They're only there after, you know,

44:54.860 --> 44:59.380
 the invention of the nation, which comes again,

44:59.380 --> 45:01.900
 mostly out of the French Revolution

45:01.900 --> 45:03.700
 and in the Romantic movement,

45:03.700 --> 45:08.420
 a man named Johann Gottfried von Herder, right?

45:08.420 --> 45:11.420
 Who was really the first one who sort of went around,

45:11.420 --> 45:14.700
 collected people's languages and collected their sayings

45:14.700 --> 45:16.980
 and their dances and their folkways and stuff

45:16.980 --> 45:19.460
 and said, isn't this cool, you know,

45:19.460 --> 45:21.780
 that they're Estonians and that they're Latvians

45:21.780 --> 45:23.140
 and that they're these other,

45:23.140 --> 45:25.900
 these interesting different peoples

45:25.900 --> 45:28.420
 who don't even know necessarily

45:28.420 --> 45:30.620
 that they're different peoples, right?

45:30.620 --> 45:33.140
 That comes a little bit later, right?

45:33.140 --> 45:36.060
 Once the concept is invented, then people start to say,

45:36.060 --> 45:39.020
 hey, we're nations too, you know?

45:39.020 --> 45:41.820
 And the Germans decide they're a nation and they unify.

45:41.820 --> 45:43.900
 And the Italians discover they're a nation

45:43.900 --> 45:46.260
 and they unify instead of being, you know,

45:46.260 --> 45:51.100
 Florentines and Romans and, you know, Sicilians.

45:52.100 --> 45:55.340
 But then beyond nations, there's political affiliations,

45:55.340 --> 45:56.180
 all those kinds of things.

45:56.180 --> 45:59.500
 It's fascinating that, you know, you start,

45:59.500 --> 46:01.580
 look at the early Homo sapiens

46:01.580 --> 46:04.220
 and then there's obviously tribes, right?

46:04.220 --> 46:06.660
 And then that's very concrete.

46:06.660 --> 46:09.500
 That's a geographic location and it's a small group

46:09.500 --> 46:12.940
 of people and you have warring tribes probably connected

46:12.940 --> 46:16.180
 to just limited resources.

46:16.180 --> 46:18.620
 But it's fascinating to think that that is then taken

46:18.620 --> 46:22.900
 to the space of ideas, to where you can create a group

46:22.900 --> 46:27.020
 at first to appreciate its beauty.

46:27.020 --> 46:30.020
 You create a group based on language,

46:30.020 --> 46:34.340
 based on maybe even political, philosophical ideas,

46:34.340 --> 46:36.380
 religious ideas, all those kinds of things.

46:36.380 --> 46:38.580
 And then that naturally then leads

46:38.580 --> 46:42.860
 to getting angry at groups and making them the other.

46:42.860 --> 46:43.900
 And then hatred.

46:43.900 --> 46:44.740
 Right.

46:44.740 --> 46:47.660
 That comes more towards the end of the 19th century,

46:47.660 --> 46:50.100
 you know, with the influence of Darwin.

46:50.100 --> 46:51.940
 I mean, you can't blame Darwin for it,

46:51.940 --> 46:54.300
 but neo Darwin, Darwinians, you know,

46:54.300 --> 46:55.860
 who start to talk about, you know,

46:55.860 --> 46:59.340
 the competition between nations, the natural competition,

46:59.340 --> 47:03.220
 the weak ones fall away, the strong ones get ahead.

47:03.220 --> 47:05.500
 You know, you get this sort of combination also

47:05.500 --> 47:08.460
 with, you know, modern antisemitism

47:08.460 --> 47:09.980
 and with racial thinking, you know,

47:09.980 --> 47:12.420
 the racial thinking at the end of the 19th century

47:12.420 --> 47:14.060
 is very powerful.

47:14.060 --> 47:16.860
 So now, you know, at the end of the 19th century

47:16.860 --> 47:19.780
 versus the beginning of the, you know,

47:19.780 --> 47:22.580
 the middle of the 19th century, you know,

47:22.580 --> 47:24.020
 you can be a German and be a Jew

47:24.020 --> 47:26.220
 and there's no contradiction.

47:26.220 --> 47:27.060
 Yeah.

47:27.060 --> 47:28.860
 As long as you speak the language and you, you know,

47:28.860 --> 47:32.420
 you dress and think and act and share the culture.

47:32.420 --> 47:35.340
 By the end of the 19th century, people saying, no, no,

47:35.340 --> 47:37.100
 you know, they're not Germans.

47:37.100 --> 47:37.940
 They're Jews, they're different.

47:37.940 --> 47:38.780
 They have different blood.

47:38.780 --> 47:40.580
 They have different, they don't say genes yet,

47:40.580 --> 47:43.740
 but you know, that's sort of a sense of people.

47:43.740 --> 47:45.420
 And that's when, you know,

47:45.420 --> 47:49.220
 there's this sense of superiority too, and inferiority.

47:49.220 --> 47:50.060
 Yeah.

47:50.060 --> 47:51.700
 You know, that they're inferior to us.

47:51.700 --> 47:52.540
 Yeah.

47:52.540 --> 47:55.380
 You know, and that we're the strong ones

47:55.380 --> 47:57.460
 and we have to, you know, and Hitler, by the way,

47:57.460 --> 48:00.260
 just adopts this hook line and sinker.

48:00.260 --> 48:03.020
 I mean, there are a whole series of thinkers

48:03.020 --> 48:05.100
 at the end of the 19th and beginning of 20th century

48:05.100 --> 48:06.900
 who he cites in Mein Kampf, you know,

48:06.900 --> 48:09.300
 which is written in the early 1920s,

48:09.300 --> 48:14.300
 that, you know, basically pervades this racial thinking.

48:15.180 --> 48:16.780
 So nationalism changes.

48:16.780 --> 48:19.860
 So nationalism in and of itself is not bad.

48:19.860 --> 48:21.220
 I mean, it's not bad, you know,

48:21.220 --> 48:25.220
 to share culture and language and, you know,

48:25.220 --> 48:29.980
 folkways and a sense of common belonging.

48:29.980 --> 48:32.780
 There's nothing bad about it inherently.

48:32.780 --> 48:35.540
 But then what happens is it becomes, you know,

48:35.540 --> 48:39.620
 frequently is used and becomes, especially on fascism,

48:39.620 --> 48:42.380
 becomes dangerous.

48:42.380 --> 48:44.580
 And it's especially dangerous

48:44.580 --> 48:48.980
 when the two conflicting groups share geographic location.

48:48.980 --> 48:49.820
 That's right.

48:49.820 --> 48:54.260
 So like with Jews, you know, I come, you know,

48:54.260 --> 48:58.780
 I'm a Russian Jew and it's always interesting.

48:58.780 --> 49:05.780
 I take pride in, you know, I love the tradition

49:05.900 --> 49:07.500
 of the Soviet Union, of Russia.

49:07.500 --> 49:08.540
 I love America.

49:08.540 --> 49:10.100
 So I love these countries.

49:10.100 --> 49:13.340
 They have beautiful tradition in literature and science

49:13.340 --> 49:15.380
 and art and all those kinds of things.

49:15.380 --> 49:19.220
 But it's funny that people, not often,

49:19.220 --> 49:24.060
 but sometimes correct me that I'm not Russian.

49:24.060 --> 49:24.900
 I'm a Jew.

49:24.900 --> 49:29.980
 And it's a, it's a, it's a nice reminder.

49:29.980 --> 49:30.980
 Yes.

49:30.980 --> 49:34.220
 That that is always there,

49:34.220 --> 49:37.260
 that desire to create these groups.

49:37.260 --> 49:39.780
 And then when they're living in the same place

49:39.780 --> 49:42.100
 for that division between groups,

49:42.100 --> 49:45.020
 that hate between groups can explode.

49:45.940 --> 49:49.540
 And I just, I wonder why is that there?

49:49.540 --> 49:53.420
 Why does, why does the human heart tend so easily

49:53.420 --> 49:55.540
 towards this kind of hate?

49:58.420 --> 50:02.580
 You know, that's a big question in and of itself.

50:02.580 --> 50:04.820
 You know, the human heart is full of everything, right?

50:04.820 --> 50:05.740
 It's full of hate.

50:05.740 --> 50:06.660
 It's full of love.

50:06.660 --> 50:07.820
 It's full of indifference.

50:07.820 --> 50:09.700
 It's full of apathy.

50:09.700 --> 50:10.700
 It's full of energy.

50:10.700 --> 50:14.940
 So, I mean, hate is something, you know, that,

50:17.660 --> 50:22.460
 I mean, I think, and, you know,

50:22.460 --> 50:25.300
 along with hate, you know, the ability to really hurt

50:25.300 --> 50:28.260
 and injure people is something that's within all of us.

50:28.260 --> 50:30.340
 You know, it's within all of us.

50:30.340 --> 50:33.420
 And it's just something that's part of who we are

50:35.140 --> 50:37.860
 and part of our society.

50:37.860 --> 50:39.980
 So, you know, we're shaped by our society

50:39.980 --> 50:43.380
 and our society can do with us often what it wishes.

50:44.740 --> 50:47.660
 You know, that's why it's so much nicer to live in a

50:47.660 --> 50:49.780
 more or less beneficent society

50:49.780 --> 50:52.500
 like that of a democracy in the West

50:52.500 --> 50:55.060
 than to live in the Soviet Union, right?

50:55.060 --> 50:59.020
 I mean, because, you know, you have more or less

50:59.020 --> 51:01.740
 the freedom to do what you wish

51:01.740 --> 51:04.380
 and not to be forced into situations

51:04.380 --> 51:08.580
 in which you would have to then do nasty to other people.

51:09.620 --> 51:12.460
 You know, some societies, as we talked about,

51:12.460 --> 51:16.700
 you know, are more have proclivities towards,

51:16.700 --> 51:19.940
 you know, asking of its people to do things

51:19.940 --> 51:24.380
 they don't want to do and forcing them to do so.

51:24.380 --> 51:27.820
 So, you know, freedom is a wonderful thing.

51:27.820 --> 51:30.860
 To be able to choose not to do evil is a great thing,

51:30.860 --> 51:33.900
 you know, whereas in some societies, you know,

51:33.900 --> 51:38.900
 you feel in some ways for not so much for the NKVD bosses,

51:39.060 --> 51:41.900
 but for the guys on the ground, you know, in the 1930s

51:41.900 --> 51:44.820
 or not so much for the Nazi bosses,

51:44.820 --> 51:49.100
 but for the guys, you know, in the police battalion

51:50.340 --> 51:53.740
 that were told, go shoot those Jews, you know?

51:53.740 --> 51:57.540
 And you do it, not necessarily because

51:57.540 --> 52:02.060
 they force you to do it, but because your social,

52:02.060 --> 52:07.060
 you know, your social situation, you know, encourages you to

52:07.580 --> 52:09.940
 and you don't have the courage not to.

52:09.940 --> 52:12.500
 Yeah, I was just, as I often do,

52:12.500 --> 52:15.940
 rereading Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning

52:15.940 --> 52:20.940
 and he said something, I just, I often pull out sort of lines.

52:22.420 --> 52:25.180
 The mere knowledge that a man was either a camp guard

52:25.180 --> 52:28.340
 or a prisoner tells us almost nothing.

52:28.340 --> 52:31.180
 Human kindness can be found in all groups,

52:31.180 --> 52:36.180
 even those which as a whole, it would be easy to condemn.

52:36.220 --> 52:41.220
 So that's speaking to, you feel for those people

52:41.220 --> 52:46.220
 at the lowest level implementing the orders of those above.

52:49.780 --> 52:50.620
 Right.

52:51.740 --> 52:54.700
 And also you worry yourself what will happen

52:54.700 --> 52:56.740
 if you were given those same orders, you know?

52:56.740 --> 52:59.020
 I mean, what would you do?

52:59.020 --> 53:01.700
 You know, what kind of reaction would you have

53:01.700 --> 53:03.380
 in a similar situation?

53:03.380 --> 53:05.860
 And you know, you don't know.

53:07.740 --> 53:10.340
 I could see myself in World War II

53:10.340 --> 53:15.340
 while fighting for almost any country that I was born in.

53:17.140 --> 53:20.260
 There's a love of community, there's a love of country

53:20.260 --> 53:23.180
 that's just, at least to me it comes naturally,

53:23.180 --> 53:27.260
 just love of community and countries wanting such community.

53:27.260 --> 53:29.460
 And I could see fighting for that country,

53:29.460 --> 53:33.660
 especially when you're sold a story that you're fighting evil

53:33.660 --> 53:35.300
 and I'm sure every single country

53:35.300 --> 53:38.540
 was sold that story effectively.

53:38.540 --> 53:41.300
 And then when you're in the military

53:41.300 --> 53:42.420
 and you have a gun in your hand

53:42.420 --> 53:47.420
 or you're in the police force and you're ordered,

53:47.660 --> 53:52.660
 go to this place and commit violence,

53:53.100 --> 53:55.420
 it's hard to know what you would do.

53:55.420 --> 53:57.540
 It's a mix of fear, it's a mix of,

53:59.020 --> 54:01.020
 maybe you convince yourself, you know,

54:01.020 --> 54:03.540
 what can one person really do?

54:03.540 --> 54:05.900
 And over time, it's again, that slippery slope.

54:05.900 --> 54:09.020
 Because you could see all the people who protest,

54:09.020 --> 54:12.620
 who revolt, they're ineffective.

54:13.900 --> 54:17.460
 So like, if you actually want to practically help somehow,

54:17.460 --> 54:19.300
 you're going to convince yourself that you can't,

54:19.300 --> 54:21.060
 one person can't possibly help.

54:22.180 --> 54:24.140
 And then you have a family, so you want to make,

54:24.140 --> 54:25.700
 you know, you want to protect your family.

54:25.700 --> 54:28.660
 You tell all these stories and over time,

54:28.660 --> 54:32.540
 it, you naturally convince yourself to dehumanize the other.

54:32.540 --> 54:35.220
 Yeah, I think about this a lot,

54:38.580 --> 54:41.500
 mostly because I worry that I wouldn't be a good German.

54:42.380 --> 54:44.580
 Yeah, no, no, that's right, that's right.

54:44.580 --> 54:48.460
 And one of the, you know, one of my tasks as a teacher,

54:48.460 --> 54:52.060
 right, our students, and I have, you know,

54:52.060 --> 54:54.420
 classes on genocide, I have one now.

54:55.900 --> 54:57.820
 And another one, by the way, on Stalin.

54:58.900 --> 55:01.100
 But the one on genocide, you know,

55:01.100 --> 55:05.820
 one of my tasks is to try to get the students to understand

55:05.820 --> 55:09.100
 this is not about weird people who live far away

55:09.100 --> 55:12.620
 in time and in place, but it's about them, you know?

55:12.620 --> 55:15.300
 And that, you know, that's a hard lesson,

55:15.300 --> 55:17.100
 but it's an important one, you know,

55:17.100 --> 55:20.540
 that this is in all of us, you know, it's in all of us.

55:20.540 --> 55:22.780
 And there's nothing, you know,

55:22.780 --> 55:25.620
 and you just try to gird yourself up, you know,

55:25.620 --> 55:29.460
 to try to figure out ways that maybe you won't be complicit.

55:29.460 --> 55:33.580
 And that you learn how to stand by your principles,

55:33.580 --> 55:36.140
 but it's very hard, it's extremely difficult.

55:36.140 --> 55:38.700
 And you can't, the other interesting thing about it

55:38.700 --> 55:40.300
 is it's not predictable.

55:40.300 --> 55:42.660
 Now, there's, they've done a lot of studies of Poles,

55:42.660 --> 55:45.860
 for example, who during the war saved Jews, you know?

55:45.860 --> 55:47.780
 Well, who are the Poles who saved Jews

55:47.780 --> 55:50.060
 versus those who turned them in?

55:50.060 --> 55:51.780
 It's completely unpredictable.

55:51.780 --> 55:53.820
 You know, sometimes it's the worst anti Semites

55:53.820 --> 55:55.420
 who protect them because they don't believe

55:55.420 --> 55:57.540
 they should be killed, right?

55:57.540 --> 56:01.180
 And sometimes, you know, it's not predictable.

56:01.180 --> 56:04.300
 It's not as if the humanists among us, you know,

56:04.300 --> 56:08.980
 are the ones who, you know, consistently show up,

56:08.980 --> 56:13.980
 you know, and experience danger, in other words,

56:13.980 --> 56:15.700
 and are ready to take on danger

56:16.740 --> 56:18.900
 to defend, you know, your fellow human beings.

56:18.900 --> 56:19.820
 Not necessarily.

56:19.820 --> 56:21.540
 I mean, sometimes simple people do it,

56:21.540 --> 56:24.780
 and sometimes they do it for really simple reasons.

56:24.780 --> 56:28.540
 And sometimes, people you would expect to do it don't.

56:29.860 --> 56:32.620
 And you've got that mix, and it's just not predictable.

56:33.540 --> 56:37.260
 One thing I've learned in this age of social media

56:37.260 --> 56:39.780
 is it feels like the people with integrity

56:39.780 --> 56:41.900
 and the ones who would do the right thing

56:41.900 --> 56:43.220
 are the quiet ones.

56:44.660 --> 56:46.860
 In terms of humanists, in terms of activists,

56:46.860 --> 56:49.020
 there's so many points to be gained

56:50.300 --> 56:53.460
 of declaring that you would do the right thing.

56:53.460 --> 56:57.460
 It's the simple, quiet folks.

56:58.700 --> 57:01.300
 Because I've seen quite, on a small,

57:01.300 --> 57:03.460
 obviously much smaller scale,

57:03.460 --> 57:05.900
 just shows of integrity and character.

57:05.900 --> 57:09.380
 When there was sacrifice to be made and it was done quietly.

57:09.380 --> 57:13.660
 Now, sort of the small heroes, those are,

57:13.660 --> 57:17.260
 you're right, it's surprising, but they're often quiet.

57:17.260 --> 57:18.900
 That's why I'm distrustful of people

57:18.900 --> 57:21.380
 who kind of proclaim that they would do the right thing.

57:21.380 --> 57:23.580
 Right, right.

57:23.580 --> 57:25.500
 And there are different kinds of integrity, too.

57:25.500 --> 57:30.500
 I mean, I edited a memoir of a Polish underground fighter,

57:34.940 --> 57:37.180
 member of the underground who was in Majdanek

57:37.180 --> 57:38.900
 in the concentration camp at Majdanek.

57:38.900 --> 57:41.180
 You know, and it was just an interesting mix

57:41.180 --> 57:43.540
 of different kinds of integrity.

57:43.540 --> 57:45.140
 You know, on the one hand,

57:45.140 --> 57:50.140
 it really bothered him deeply

57:50.340 --> 57:52.820
 when Jews were killed or sent to camp

57:52.820 --> 57:53.660
 or that sort of thing.

57:53.660 --> 57:56.780
 On the other hand, he was something of an anti Semite.

57:56.780 --> 57:59.660
 You know, he would, you know,

57:59.660 --> 58:02.780
 sometimes if Jews were his friends, he would help them.

58:02.780 --> 58:06.340
 And if they weren't, sometimes he was really mean to them.

58:06.340 --> 58:08.180
 You know, and you could, in their various levels,

58:08.180 --> 58:13.180
 you know, a concentration camp is a terrible social experiment

58:13.180 --> 58:15.460
 in some ways, right?

58:15.460 --> 58:19.940
 But you learn a lot from how people behave.

58:19.940 --> 58:21.300
 And what you see is that, you know,

58:21.300 --> 58:23.980
 people behave sometimes extraordinarily well

58:23.980 --> 58:26.660
 in some situations and extraordinarily poorly in others.

58:26.660 --> 58:28.740
 And it's mixed and you can't predict it.

58:28.740 --> 58:32.380
 And it's hard to find consistency.

58:32.380 --> 58:33.500
 I mean, that's the other thing.

58:33.500 --> 58:37.180
 It's, you know, I think we claim too much consistency

58:37.180 --> 58:38.460
 for the people we study

58:38.460 --> 58:40.380
 and the people we think about in the past.

58:40.380 --> 58:42.660
 You know, they're not consistent any more than we are

58:42.660 --> 58:43.620
 consistent, right?

58:45.140 --> 58:48.060
 Well, let me ask you about human nature here on both sides.

58:48.060 --> 58:53.060
 So first, what have you learned about human nature

58:53.100 --> 58:54.700
 from studying genocide?

58:54.700 --> 58:56.820
 Why do humans commit genocide?

58:56.820 --> 59:01.540
 What lessons, first of all, why is a difficult question,

59:01.540 --> 59:04.860
 but what insights do you have into humans

59:04.860 --> 59:07.820
 that genocide is something that happens in the world?

59:07.820 --> 59:10.380
 That's a really big and difficult question, right?

59:10.380 --> 59:13.900
 And it has to be parsed, I think,

59:13.900 --> 59:16.420
 into different kinds of questions.

59:16.420 --> 59:18.780
 You know, why does genocide happen?

59:19.620 --> 59:24.380
 You know, which the answer there is frequently political,

59:24.380 --> 59:28.940
 meaning, you know, why Hitler ended up killing the Jews.

59:28.940 --> 59:32.020
 Well, it had a lot to do with the political history

59:32.020 --> 59:35.380
 of Germany and wartime history of Germany, right?

59:35.380 --> 59:40.380
 In the 30s, and, you know, it's traceable to then.

59:40.500 --> 59:42.980
 No, like you mentioned it yourself,

59:42.980 --> 59:46.020
 you can't imagine Hitler in the mid 20s

59:46.020 --> 59:49.580
 turning into anything of the kind of dictator

59:49.580 --> 59:53.180
 he ended up being and the kind of murderer,

59:53.180 --> 59:55.540
 mass murderer he ended up being.

59:55.540 --> 59:58.860
 So, and the same thing goes, by the way,

59:58.860 --> 1:00:01.260
 for Stalin and Soviet Union and Pol Pot.

1:00:01.260 --> 1:00:04.820
 I mean, these are all essentially political movements

1:00:04.820 --> 1:00:08.140
 where the polity state is seized, you know,

1:00:08.140 --> 1:00:13.140
 by a ideological or, you know, party, single party movement

1:00:14.180 --> 1:00:15.780
 and then is moved in directions

1:00:15.780 --> 1:00:18.500
 where mass killing takes place.

1:00:18.500 --> 1:00:20.380
 The other question, you know,

1:00:20.380 --> 1:00:22.620
 let's separate that question out.

1:00:22.620 --> 1:00:26.780
 The other question is why do ordinary people participate?

1:00:26.780 --> 1:00:31.060
 Because the fact of the matter is,

1:00:31.060 --> 1:00:33.780
 just ordering genocide is not enough.

1:00:33.780 --> 1:00:36.620
 Just saying, you know, go get them is not enough.

1:00:36.620 --> 1:00:39.140
 There have to be people who will cooperate

1:00:39.140 --> 1:00:41.420
 and who will do their jobs, you know,

1:00:41.420 --> 1:00:43.060
 both at the kind of mezzo level,

1:00:43.060 --> 1:00:45.340
 the middle level of a bureaucracy,

1:00:45.340 --> 1:00:47.060
 but also at the everyday level.

1:00:47.060 --> 1:00:48.700
 You know, people who have to pull the triggers

1:00:48.700 --> 1:00:50.380
 and that kind of thing and, you know,

1:00:50.380 --> 1:00:52.220
 force people into the gas chamber

1:00:52.220 --> 1:00:56.740
 and grab people, you know, in Kiev in September 1941

1:00:56.740 --> 1:01:00.540
 at Babin Yar and push them, you know, towards the ravine

1:01:00.540 --> 1:01:03.900
 where the machine gunners are gonna shoot them down.

1:01:03.900 --> 1:01:06.740
 You know, and those are all different questions.

1:01:06.740 --> 1:01:11.740
 The question of, you know, especially the lower level people

1:01:11.940 --> 1:01:14.460
 who actually do the killing is a question

1:01:14.460 --> 1:01:15.980
 which I think we've been talking about,

1:01:15.980 --> 1:01:18.460
 which is that within all of us,

1:01:19.420 --> 1:01:21.980
 you know, is the capability of being murderers

1:01:21.980 --> 1:01:22.940
 and mass murderers.

1:01:22.940 --> 1:01:25.460
 I mean, to participate in mass murder.

1:01:25.460 --> 1:01:27.860
 I won't call them laws of social psychology,

1:01:27.860 --> 1:01:31.220
 but the character of social psychology.

1:01:31.220 --> 1:01:33.380
 You know, we will do it in most cases.

1:01:33.380 --> 1:01:35.700
 I mean, one of the shocking things that I learned

1:01:35.700 --> 1:01:39.020
 just a few years ago studying the Holocaust

1:01:39.020 --> 1:01:41.860
 is that you could pull out.

1:01:41.860 --> 1:01:44.340
 In other words, if they order a police battalion

1:01:44.340 --> 1:01:47.660
 to go shoot Jews, you didn't have to do it.

1:01:48.780 --> 1:01:49.620
 You could pull out.

1:01:49.620 --> 1:01:51.500
 They weren't gonna, they never killed anybody.

1:01:51.500 --> 1:01:53.260
 They never executed anybody.

1:01:53.260 --> 1:01:54.820
 They never even punished people for saying,

1:01:54.820 --> 1:01:56.420
 no, I'm not gonna do that.

1:01:56.420 --> 1:01:58.540
 So people are doing it voluntarily.

1:01:58.540 --> 1:02:01.100
 They may not want to do it.

1:02:01.100 --> 1:02:03.780
 You know, they give them booze to try to, you know,

1:02:03.780 --> 1:02:06.460
 numb the pain of murder,

1:02:06.460 --> 1:02:08.300
 because they know there is pain.

1:02:08.300 --> 1:02:11.660
 I mean, people experience pain when they murder people,

1:02:11.660 --> 1:02:13.860
 but they don't pull out.

1:02:13.860 --> 1:02:16.700
 And so it's the character of who we are in the society,

1:02:16.700 --> 1:02:20.220
 in groups, and we're very, very influenced.

1:02:20.220 --> 1:02:22.660
 I mean, we're highly influenced by the groups

1:02:22.660 --> 1:02:24.780
 in which we operate.

1:02:24.780 --> 1:02:28.020
 And, you know, who we talk to,

1:02:28.020 --> 1:02:30.900
 and who our friends are within that group,

1:02:30.900 --> 1:02:32.820
 and who is the head of the group.

1:02:32.820 --> 1:02:34.740
 And I mean, you see this even,

1:02:34.740 --> 1:02:36.420
 I mean, you see it in any group, you know,

1:02:36.420 --> 1:02:39.620
 whether it's in the academy, right, at Stanford,

1:02:39.620 --> 1:02:42.300
 or whether it's, you know, in a labor union,

1:02:42.300 --> 1:02:44.980
 or whether it's in a church group in Tennessee,

1:02:44.980 --> 1:02:49.180
 or wherever, you know, people pay attention to each other,

1:02:49.180 --> 1:02:54.180
 and they are unwilling, frequently, to say no.

1:02:54.180 --> 1:02:56.220
 This is wrong.

1:02:56.220 --> 1:02:58.260
 Even though all of you think it's right, it's wrong.

1:02:58.260 --> 1:03:00.900
 I mean, you just don't do that, usually,

1:03:00.900 --> 1:03:05.900
 especially in societies that are authoritarian,

1:03:06.260 --> 1:03:08.100
 or totalitarian, right?

1:03:08.100 --> 1:03:10.940
 Because it's harder, because there's a backup to it, right?

1:03:10.940 --> 1:03:13.380
 There's the NKVD there, or there's the Gestapo there,

1:03:13.380 --> 1:03:14.780
 and there are other people there.

1:03:14.780 --> 1:03:18.900
 So you just, you know, they may not be forcing you to do it,

1:03:18.900 --> 1:03:23.900
 but your social being, plus this danger in the distance,

1:03:26.900 --> 1:03:28.460
 you know, you do it.

1:03:28.460 --> 1:03:31.260
 But then, if you go up the hierarchy,

1:03:31.260 --> 1:03:33.460
 at the very top, there's a dictator.

1:03:33.460 --> 1:03:36.340
 Presumably, you know, you go to, like, middle management

1:03:36.340 --> 1:03:37.520
 to the bureaucracy.

1:03:39.860 --> 1:03:41.140
 The higher you get up there,

1:03:41.140 --> 1:03:44.340
 the more power you have to change the direction

1:03:44.340 --> 1:03:45.540
 of the Titanic.

1:03:45.540 --> 1:03:46.940
 Right, right, right.

1:03:46.940 --> 1:03:49.180
 But nobody seems to do it.

1:03:49.180 --> 1:03:52.580
 Right, or what happens, and it does happen.

1:03:52.580 --> 1:03:54.620
 It happens in the German army.

1:03:54.620 --> 1:03:57.660
 I mean, it happens in the case of the Armenian genocide,

1:03:57.660 --> 1:03:59.140
 where we know there are governors who said,

1:03:59.140 --> 1:04:01.460
 no, I'm not gonna kill Armenians.

1:04:01.460 --> 1:04:02.460
 What kind of business is this?

1:04:02.460 --> 1:04:03.640
 They're just removed.

1:04:04.540 --> 1:04:07.880
 They're removed, and you find a replacement very easily.

1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:10.580
 So, you know, you do see people who stand up.

1:04:10.580 --> 1:04:13.680
 And again, it's not really predictable who it will be.

1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:14.540
 I would maintain.

1:04:14.540 --> 1:04:18.120
 I mean, I haven't done the study of the Armenian governors

1:04:18.120 --> 1:04:19.220
 who said no.

1:04:19.220 --> 1:04:21.120
 I mean, the Turkish governors who said no

1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:23.420
 to the Armenian genocide.

1:04:23.420 --> 1:04:28.420
 But, you know, there are people who do step aside

1:04:28.980 --> 1:04:31.060
 every once in a while in the middle level.

1:04:31.060 --> 1:04:32.600
 And again, they're German generals who say,

1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:34.420
 wait a minute, what is this business in Poland

1:04:34.420 --> 1:04:37.920
 when they start to kill Jews or in Belorussia?

1:04:37.920 --> 1:04:40.420
 And, you know, they're just pushed aside.

1:04:40.420 --> 1:04:42.980
 You know, if they don't do their job, they're pushed aside.

1:04:42.980 --> 1:04:44.060
 Or they end up doing it.

1:04:44.060 --> 1:04:45.860
 And they usually do end up doing it.

1:04:47.540 --> 1:04:49.700
 What about on the victim side?

1:04:49.700 --> 1:04:51.740
 So, I mentioned man's search for meaning.

1:04:52.740 --> 1:04:55.340
 What can we learn about human nature,

1:04:55.340 --> 1:04:59.620
 the human mind from the victims of genocide?

1:04:59.620 --> 1:05:02.340
 So, Viktor Frankl talked about the ability

1:05:02.340 --> 1:05:06.000
 to discover meaning and beauty, even in suffering.

1:05:07.360 --> 1:05:10.140
 Is there something to be said about, you know,

1:05:10.140 --> 1:05:11.720
 in your studying of genocide

1:05:11.720 --> 1:05:14.180
 that you've learned about human nature?

1:05:15.740 --> 1:05:19.420
 Well, again, I don't, I have to say,

1:05:19.420 --> 1:05:21.140
 I come out of the study of genocide

1:05:21.140 --> 1:05:24.340
 with a very pessimistic view of human nature.

1:05:24.340 --> 1:05:25.740
 A very pessimistic view.

1:05:25.740 --> 1:05:26.900
 Even on the victim side?

1:05:26.900 --> 1:05:28.960
 Even on the victim side.

1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:33.640
 I mean, the victims will eat their children, right?

1:05:33.640 --> 1:05:36.080
 Ukrainian case, they have no choice.

1:05:36.080 --> 1:05:38.720
 You know, the victims will rob each other.

1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:43.720
 The victims will form hierarchies within victimhood.

1:05:44.020 --> 1:05:46.740
 So, you see, let me give you an example.

1:05:46.740 --> 1:05:49.960
 Again, I told you I was working on Majdanek.

1:05:50.860 --> 1:05:55.860
 And there's, in Majdanek, at a certain point in 42,

1:05:57.340 --> 1:06:01.460
 a group of Slovak Jews were arrested

1:06:02.500 --> 1:06:04.940
 and sent to Majdanek.

1:06:04.940 --> 1:06:08.460
 Those Slovak Jews were a group,

1:06:08.460 --> 1:06:11.340
 somehow they stuck together, they were very competent,

1:06:11.340 --> 1:06:14.900
 they were, you know, many of them were businessmen,

1:06:14.900 --> 1:06:16.460
 they knew each other,

1:06:16.460 --> 1:06:19.900
 and for a variety of different reasons within the camp.

1:06:19.900 --> 1:06:22.340
 And again, this shows you the diversity of the camps

1:06:22.340 --> 1:06:24.560
 and also, you know, these images of black and white

1:06:24.560 --> 1:06:26.780
 in the camps are not very useful.

1:06:26.780 --> 1:06:29.060
 They ruled the camp.

1:06:29.060 --> 1:06:31.160
 I mean, they basically had all the important jobs

1:06:31.160 --> 1:06:35.780
 in the camp, including jobs like beating other Jews,

1:06:35.780 --> 1:06:40.660
 and persecuting other Jews, and persecuting other peoples,

1:06:41.780 --> 1:06:43.540
 which they did.

1:06:43.540 --> 1:06:46.340
 And this Polish guy who I mentioned to you,

1:06:46.340 --> 1:06:48.740
 who wrote this memoir, hated them

1:06:48.740 --> 1:06:53.540
 because of what they were doing to the Poles, right?

1:06:53.540 --> 1:06:57.460
 And he, you know, he's incensed

1:06:57.460 --> 1:07:01.180
 because aren't these supposed to be the Untermenschen?

1:07:01.180 --> 1:07:02.680
 He says, and look what they're doing,

1:07:02.680 --> 1:07:06.220
 they're treating us, you know, like dirt.

1:07:06.220 --> 1:07:08.780
 And they do, they treat them like dirt.

1:07:08.780 --> 1:07:11.460
 So, you know, in this kind of work on Majdanek,

1:07:11.460 --> 1:07:16.020
 there's certainly parts of it that, you know,

1:07:16.020 --> 1:07:20.860
 were inspiring, you know, people helping each other,

1:07:20.860 --> 1:07:23.100
 people trying to feed each other,

1:07:23.100 --> 1:07:24.920
 people giving warmth to each other.

1:07:24.920 --> 1:07:29.920
 You know, there's some very heroic Polish women

1:07:30.420 --> 1:07:33.780
 who end up having a radio show called Radio Majdanek,

1:07:33.780 --> 1:07:36.480
 which they put on every night in the women's camp,

1:07:36.480 --> 1:07:39.420
 which is, you know, to raise people's spirits.

1:07:39.420 --> 1:07:41.420
 And they, you know, sing songs

1:07:41.420 --> 1:07:43.100
 and do all this kind of stuff, you know,

1:07:43.100 --> 1:07:47.980
 to try to keep themselves from, you know,

1:07:47.980 --> 1:07:51.100
 the horrors that they're experiencing around them.

1:07:51.100 --> 1:07:54.220
 And so you do see that, and you do see,

1:07:54.220 --> 1:07:59.220
 you know, human beings acting in support of each other.

1:08:00.420 --> 1:08:05.420
 But, you know, I mean, Primo Levi is one of my favorite

1:08:06.560 --> 1:08:10.340
 writers about the Holocaust and about the camps.

1:08:10.340 --> 1:08:15.100
 And, you know, I don't think Primo Levi saw anything.

1:08:15.100 --> 1:08:17.420
 You know, I mean, he had pals, you know,

1:08:17.420 --> 1:08:20.060
 who he helped and who helped him.

1:08:20.060 --> 1:08:25.060
 I mean, but he describes this kind of, you know,

1:08:25.700 --> 1:08:27.520
 terrible inhuman environment,

1:08:27.520 --> 1:08:30.460
 which no one can escape, really, no one can escape.

1:08:30.460 --> 1:08:32.260
 He ends up committing suicide too, I think,

1:08:32.260 --> 1:08:37.260
 because of his sense of, we don't know exactly why,

1:08:37.500 --> 1:08:39.460
 but probably because of his sense

1:08:39.460 --> 1:08:41.460
 of what happened in the camp.

1:08:41.460 --> 1:08:42.900
 I mean, later he goes back to Italy,

1:08:42.900 --> 1:08:44.580
 becomes a writer and that sort of thing.

1:08:44.580 --> 1:08:49.340
 So I don't, I don't, especially in the concentration camps,

1:08:49.340 --> 1:08:52.940
 it's really hard to find places like Wickel Frankel

1:08:52.940 --> 1:08:54.420
 where you can say, you know,

1:08:54.420 --> 1:08:59.420
 I am moved in a positive way, you know, by what happened.

1:09:02.620 --> 1:09:04.300
 There were cases, there's no question.

1:09:04.300 --> 1:09:06.360
 People hung together, they tried to help each other,

1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:11.360
 but, you know, they were totally, totally caught

1:09:11.460 --> 1:09:15.740
 in this web of genocide.

1:09:15.740 --> 1:09:19.420
 See, so there are stories, but the thing is, I have this

1:09:19.420 --> 1:09:22.900
 sense, maybe it's a hope, that within most,

1:09:22.900 --> 1:09:26.620
 if not every human heart, there's a kind of, like,

1:09:26.620 --> 1:09:31.620
 flame of compassion and kindness and love that waits,

1:09:34.820 --> 1:09:37.240
 that longs to connect with others,

1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:41.020
 that ultimately en masse overpowers everything else.

1:09:41.020 --> 1:09:43.380
 If you just look at the story of human history,

1:09:43.380 --> 1:09:48.380
 the resistance to violence and mass murder and genocide

1:09:50.500 --> 1:09:52.900
 feels like a force that's there.

1:09:54.140 --> 1:09:57.220
 And it feels like a force that's more powerful

1:09:57.220 --> 1:10:02.220
 than whatever the dark momentum that leads to genocide is.

1:10:04.700 --> 1:10:08.740
 It feels like that's more powerful, it's just quiet.

1:10:08.740 --> 1:10:10.740
 It's hard to tell the story of that little flame

1:10:10.740 --> 1:10:14.060
 that burns within all of our hearts,

1:10:14.060 --> 1:10:16.580
 that longing to connect to other human beings.

1:10:16.580 --> 1:10:18.940
 And there's something also about human nature

1:10:18.940 --> 1:10:21.580
 and us as storytellers, that we're not very good

1:10:21.580 --> 1:10:24.060
 at telling the stories of that little flame.

1:10:24.060 --> 1:10:27.020
 We're much better at telling the stories of atrocities.

1:10:27.020 --> 1:10:30.220
 No, you know, I think maybe I fundamentally

1:10:30.220 --> 1:10:32.580
 disagree with you, I think maybe I fundamentally,

1:10:32.580 --> 1:10:35.260
 I don't disagree that there is that flame.

1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:38.920
 I just think it's just too easily doused.

1:10:38.920 --> 1:10:43.340
 And I think it's too easily goes out in a lot of people.

1:10:43.340 --> 1:10:48.340
 And I mean, like I say, I come away from this work,

1:10:49.060 --> 1:10:50.820
 a pessimist.

1:10:50.820 --> 1:10:54.640
 You know, there is this work by a Harvard psychologist,

1:10:54.640 --> 1:10:55.480
 now I'm forgetting his name.

1:10:55.480 --> 1:10:56.540
 Stephen Pinker.

1:10:56.540 --> 1:11:01.260
 Yes, yes, Stephen Pinker, that shows over time, you know,

1:11:01.260 --> 1:11:03.420
 and you know, initially I was quite skeptical of the work,

1:11:03.420 --> 1:11:05.820
 but in the end, I thought he was quite convincing

1:11:05.820 --> 1:11:10.820
 that over time, the incidence of homicide, you know,

1:11:12.420 --> 1:11:14.900
 goes down, the incidence of rape goes down,

1:11:14.900 --> 1:11:18.900
 the incidence of genocide, except for the big blip,

1:11:18.900 --> 1:11:22.300
 you know, in the middle of the 20th century goes down.

1:11:22.300 --> 1:11:24.820
 Not markedly, but it goes down generally,

1:11:24.820 --> 1:11:27.860
 that you know, more than norms, international norms

1:11:27.860 --> 1:11:30.100
 are changing how we think about this and stuff like that.

1:11:30.100 --> 1:11:33.060
 I thought he was pretty convincing about that.

1:11:33.060 --> 1:11:37.220
 But think about, you know, we're modern people.

1:11:37.220 --> 1:11:41.980
 I mean, we've advanced so fast in so many different areas.

1:11:41.980 --> 1:11:45.180
 I mean, we should have eliminated this a long time ago,

1:11:45.180 --> 1:11:46.420
 a long time ago.

1:11:47.420 --> 1:11:50.860
 You know, how is it that, you know,

1:11:50.860 --> 1:11:54.380
 we're still facing this business of genocide in Myanmar,

1:11:54.380 --> 1:11:59.380
 in Xinjiang, in, you know, Tigray, in Ethiopia,

1:11:59.860 --> 1:12:02.380
 you know, the potentials of genocide there.

1:12:02.380 --> 1:12:06.900
 And all over the world, you know, we still have this thing

1:12:06.900 --> 1:12:10.220
 that we cannot handle, that we can't deal with.

1:12:10.220 --> 1:12:14.340
 And, you know, again, you know, electric cars and planes

1:12:14.340 --> 1:12:16.800
 that fly from here to, you know, Beijing.

1:12:18.700 --> 1:12:21.260
 Think about the differences between 250 years ago

1:12:21.260 --> 1:12:25.500
 or 300 years ago and today, but the differences in genocide

1:12:25.500 --> 1:12:26.760
 are not all that great.

1:12:26.760 --> 1:12:28.680
 I mean, the incidence has gone down.

1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:31.360
 I think Pinker has demonstrated, I mean,

1:12:31.360 --> 1:12:32.820
 there are problems with his methodology,

1:12:32.820 --> 1:12:35.420
 but on the whole, I'm with him on that book.

1:12:35.420 --> 1:12:38.940
 I thought in the end, it was quite well done.

1:12:38.940 --> 1:12:43.940
 So, you know, I do not, I have to say,

1:12:44.500 --> 1:12:48.960
 I'm not an optimist about what this human flame can do.

1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:53.020
 And, you know, I once, someone once said to me,

1:12:53.020 --> 1:12:56.300
 when I posed a similar kind of question to a seminar,

1:12:56.300 --> 1:12:57.900
 a friend of mine at Berkeley once said,

1:12:57.900 --> 1:13:01.620
 remember original sin, Norman, well, I don't, you know,

1:13:01.620 --> 1:13:05.320
 that's very Catholic and I don't really think

1:13:05.320 --> 1:13:09.080
 in terms of original sin, but in some ways, you know,

1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:11.800
 her point is we carry this with us, you know,

1:13:11.800 --> 1:13:16.800
 we carry with us a really potentially nasty mean streak

1:13:20.220 --> 1:13:22.380
 that can do harm to other people.

1:13:22.380 --> 1:13:24.620
 Well, we carry the capacity to love too.

1:13:24.620 --> 1:13:26.240
 Yes, we do, yes, we do.

1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:28.520
 That's part of the deal.

1:13:28.520 --> 1:13:32.100
 You have a bias in that you have studied

1:13:32.100 --> 1:13:34.880
 some of the darker aspects of human nature

1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:36.580
 and human history.

1:13:36.580 --> 1:13:41.580
 So it is difficult from the trenches, from the muck,

1:13:42.540 --> 1:13:46.860
 to see a possible sort of way out through love.

1:13:46.860 --> 1:13:50.500
 But it's not obvious that that's not the case.

1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:54.800
 You mentioned electric cars and rockets and airplanes.

1:13:54.800 --> 1:13:58.820
 To me, the more powerful thing is Wikipedia, the internet.

1:13:58.820 --> 1:14:02.400
 Only 50% of the world currently has access to the internet,

1:14:02.400 --> 1:14:05.900
 but that's growing in information and knowledge and wisdom,

1:14:05.900 --> 1:14:08.180
 especially among women in the world.

1:14:08.180 --> 1:14:12.680
 As that grows, I think it becomes a lot more difficult

1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:15.200
 if love wins, it becomes a lot more difficult

1:14:15.200 --> 1:14:16.820
 for somebody like Hitler to take power,

1:14:16.820 --> 1:14:19.680
 for genocide to occur, because people think,

1:14:20.940 --> 1:14:23.680
 and the masses, I think, the people have power

1:14:23.680 --> 1:14:26.180
 when they're able to think,

1:14:26.180 --> 1:14:28.180
 when they can see the full kind of...

1:14:30.140 --> 1:14:34.040
 First of all, when they can study your work,

1:14:34.040 --> 1:14:36.340
 they can know about the fact that genocide happens,

1:14:36.340 --> 1:14:40.500
 how it occurs, how the promises of great charismatic leaders

1:14:40.500 --> 1:14:44.700
 lead to great, destructive mass genocide.

1:14:44.700 --> 1:14:48.940
 And just even studying the fact that the Holocaust happened

1:14:48.940 --> 1:14:53.260
 for a large number of people is a powerful preventer

1:14:53.260 --> 1:14:55.340
 of future genocide.

1:14:55.340 --> 1:14:58.500
 One of the lessons of history is just knowing

1:14:58.500 --> 1:15:01.580
 that this can happen, learning how it happens,

1:15:01.580 --> 1:15:06.580
 that normal human beings, leaders that give big promises,

1:15:07.180 --> 1:15:09.580
 can also become evil and destructive.

1:15:09.580 --> 1:15:12.020
 The fact, knowing that that can happen

1:15:12.020 --> 1:15:13.900
 is a powerful preventer of that,

1:15:13.900 --> 1:15:16.860
 and then you kind of wake up from this haze

1:15:16.860 --> 1:15:19.800
 of believing everything you hear,

1:15:19.800 --> 1:15:24.800
 and you learn to just, in your small, local way,

1:15:25.700 --> 1:15:28.940
 to put more love out there in the world.

1:15:28.940 --> 1:15:31.460
 I believe it's possible, it's not too good,

1:15:31.460 --> 1:15:35.300
 sort of to push back, it's not so obvious to me

1:15:35.300 --> 1:15:40.040
 that in the end, I think in the end, love wins.

1:15:40.040 --> 1:15:43.020
 That's my intuition, I've had to put money on it.

1:15:43.020 --> 1:15:46.620
 I have a sense that this genocide thing

1:15:46.620 --> 1:15:51.260
 is more and more going to be an artifact of the past.

1:15:51.260 --> 1:15:53.100
 Well, I certainly hope you're right.

1:15:53.100 --> 1:15:54.500
 I mean, I certainly hope you're right.

1:15:54.500 --> 1:15:59.220
 And it could be you are, we don't know.

1:16:00.160 --> 1:16:04.020
 But the evidence is different.

1:16:04.020 --> 1:16:05.260
 The evidence is different.

1:16:05.260 --> 1:16:10.260
 And the capacity of human beings to do evil

1:16:10.260 --> 1:16:16.260
 to other human beings is repeatedly demonstrated.

1:16:17.820 --> 1:16:20.140
 Whether it's in massacres in Mexico,

1:16:20.140 --> 1:16:25.060
 or ISIS and the Yazidi Kurds,

1:16:25.060 --> 1:16:27.640
 or you can just go on and on.

1:16:27.640 --> 1:16:29.700
 Syria, I mean, look what, I mean,

1:16:29.700 --> 1:16:34.700
 Syria used to be a country, and now it's been a mass grave,

1:16:35.700 --> 1:16:39.300
 and people then have left in the millions

1:16:39.300 --> 1:16:41.100
 for other places.

1:16:41.100 --> 1:16:46.100
 And you know, I'm not saying, you know, I'm not saying,

1:16:46.580 --> 1:16:48.980
 I mean, the Turks have done nice things for the Syrians,

1:16:48.980 --> 1:16:51.120
 and the Germans welcomed in a million or so,

1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:53.360
 and actually reasonably absorbed them.

1:16:53.360 --> 1:16:57.660
 I mean, I'm not saying bad things only happen in the world.

1:16:57.660 --> 1:16:59.100
 They're good and bad things that happen,

1:16:59.100 --> 1:17:00.300
 you're absolutely right.

1:17:02.220 --> 1:17:04.860
 But I don't think we're on the path

1:17:04.860 --> 1:17:08.380
 to eliminating these bad things,

1:17:08.380 --> 1:17:10.160
 really bad things from happening.

1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:11.180
 I just don't think we are.

1:17:11.180 --> 1:17:12.980
 And I don't think there's any,

1:17:12.980 --> 1:17:15.500
 I don't think the facts demonstrate it.

1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:17.300
 I mean, I hope, I hope you're right.

1:17:17.300 --> 1:17:20.960
 But I think otherwise, it's just an article of faith.

1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:23.580
 Well.

1:17:23.580 --> 1:17:25.500
 You know, which is perfectly fine.

1:17:25.500 --> 1:17:27.260
 It's better to have that article of faith

1:17:27.260 --> 1:17:29.940
 than to have an article of faith which says,

1:17:29.940 --> 1:17:32.180
 you know, things should get bad, or things like that.

1:17:32.180 --> 1:17:33.900
 Well, it's not just fine.

1:17:33.900 --> 1:17:36.860
 It's the only way if you want to build a better future.

1:17:36.860 --> 1:17:38.760
 So optimism is a prerequisite

1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:40.540
 for engineering a better future.

1:17:40.540 --> 1:17:43.400
 So like, okay, so a historian

1:17:43.400 --> 1:17:46.100
 has to see clearly into the past.

1:17:46.100 --> 1:17:51.100
 An engineer has to imagine a future

1:17:51.700 --> 1:17:54.220
 that's different from the past,

1:17:54.220 --> 1:17:55.980
 that's better than the past.

1:17:55.980 --> 1:17:57.420
 Because without that,

1:17:57.420 --> 1:17:59.500
 they're not going to be able to build a better future.

1:17:59.500 --> 1:18:01.240
 So there's a kind of saying,

1:18:01.240 --> 1:18:02.620
 like you have to consider the facts.

1:18:02.620 --> 1:18:05.540
 Well, at every single moment in history,

1:18:05.540 --> 1:18:10.120
 if you allow yourself to be too grounded

1:18:10.120 --> 1:18:11.300
 by the facts of the past,

1:18:11.300 --> 1:18:12.800
 you're not going to create the future.

1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:15.140
 So that's kind of the tension that we're living with.

1:18:15.140 --> 1:18:16.820
 To have a chance, we have to imagine

1:18:16.820 --> 1:18:18.640
 that the better future is possible.

1:18:19.500 --> 1:18:23.980
 But one of the ways to do that is to study history.

1:18:23.980 --> 1:18:25.940
 Which engineers don't do enough of.

1:18:25.940 --> 1:18:26.780
 They do not.

1:18:26.780 --> 1:18:29.260
 Which is a real problem.

1:18:29.260 --> 1:18:30.980
 It's a real problem.

1:18:30.980 --> 1:18:33.180
 Or basically a lot of disciplines in science

1:18:33.180 --> 1:18:35.240
 and so on don't do enough of.

1:18:36.620 --> 1:18:41.360
 Can you tell the story of China from 1958 to 1962,

1:18:41.360 --> 1:18:44.980
 what was called the Great Leap Forward,

1:18:44.980 --> 1:18:47.420
 orchestrated by Chairman Mao Zedong

1:18:47.420 --> 1:18:49.780
 that led to the deaths of tens of millions of people

1:18:49.780 --> 1:18:53.560
 making it arguably the largest famine in human history?

1:18:55.020 --> 1:18:55.840
 Yes.

1:18:55.840 --> 1:18:59.860
 I mean, it was a terrible set of events

1:18:59.860 --> 1:19:02.220
 that led to the death.

1:19:02.220 --> 1:19:04.060
 People will dispute the numbers.

1:19:07.060 --> 1:19:11.300
 15 million, 17 million, 14 million,

1:19:11.300 --> 1:19:15.540
 20 million people died in the Great Leap.

1:19:15.540 --> 1:19:17.420
 Many people say 30, 40, 50 million.

1:19:17.420 --> 1:19:18.980
 Some people will go that high too.

1:19:18.980 --> 1:19:21.060
 That's right, that's right.

1:19:21.060 --> 1:19:25.260
 Essentially, Mao and the Communist Party leadership,

1:19:25.260 --> 1:19:28.500
 but it was mostly Mao's doing,

1:19:28.500 --> 1:19:33.220
 decided he wanted to move the country into communism.

1:19:33.220 --> 1:19:35.980
 And part of the idea of that

1:19:35.980 --> 1:19:37.940
 was rivalry with the Soviet Union.

1:19:39.660 --> 1:19:41.220
 Mao was a good Stalinist,

1:19:41.220 --> 1:19:43.300
 or at least felt like Stalin

1:19:43.300 --> 1:19:46.380
 was the right kind of communist leader to have,

1:19:46.380 --> 1:19:48.100
 and he didn't like Khrushchev at all,

1:19:48.100 --> 1:19:51.220
 and he didn't like what he thought were Khrushchev's reforms

1:19:51.220 --> 1:19:54.180
 and also Khrushchev's pretensions

1:19:54.180 --> 1:19:57.180
 to moving the Soviet Union into communism.

1:19:57.180 --> 1:19:59.700
 So Khrushchev started talking about giving more power

1:19:59.700 --> 1:20:01.740
 to the party, less power to the state,

1:20:01.740 --> 1:20:04.480
 and if you have more power to the party versus the state,

1:20:04.480 --> 1:20:07.220
 then you're moving into communism quicker.

1:20:07.220 --> 1:20:11.380
 So what Mao decided to do was to engage in this vast program

1:20:12.340 --> 1:20:16.980
 of building what were called people's communes.

1:20:16.980 --> 1:20:21.980
 And these communes were enormous conglomerations

1:20:22.300 --> 1:20:25.500
 of essentially collective farms,

1:20:25.500 --> 1:20:28.380
 and what would happen on those communes

1:20:28.380 --> 1:20:31.540
 is there would be places for people to eat,

1:20:31.540 --> 1:20:34.920
 and there would be places for the kids to be raised

1:20:34.920 --> 1:20:38.020
 in essentially kind of separate homes,

1:20:38.020 --> 1:20:39.980
 and they would be schooled.

1:20:39.980 --> 1:20:42.700
 Everybody would turn over their metal,

1:20:42.700 --> 1:20:43.540
 which was one of the,

1:20:43.540 --> 1:20:46.780
 actually it turned out to be a terribly negative phenomenon,

1:20:46.780 --> 1:20:51.700
 their metal pots and pans to be melted to then make steel.

1:20:51.700 --> 1:20:55.700
 Every of these big communes would all have little steel plants

1:20:55.700 --> 1:20:57.300
 and they would build steel

1:20:57.300 --> 1:21:01.340
 and the whole countryside would be transformed.

1:21:01.340 --> 1:21:03.420
 Well, like many of these sort of,

1:21:03.420 --> 1:21:07.660
 I mean a true megalomaniac project,

1:21:07.660 --> 1:21:10.220
 like some of Stalin's projects too.

1:21:10.220 --> 1:21:12.980
 And this particular project then,

1:21:12.980 --> 1:21:15.260
 the people had no choice.

1:21:15.260 --> 1:21:18.740
 They were forced to do this.

1:21:18.740 --> 1:21:23.740
 It was incredibly dysfunctional for Chinese agriculture

1:21:25.820 --> 1:21:30.820
 and ended up creating, as you mentioned, a terrible famine

1:21:32.500 --> 1:21:36.460
 that everybody understood was a famine as a result of this.

1:21:36.460 --> 1:21:40.380
 I mean, there were also some problems of nature

1:21:40.380 --> 1:21:42.740
 at the same time and some flooding and bad weather

1:21:42.740 --> 1:21:46.140
 and that sort of thing, but it was really a manmade famine.

1:21:46.140 --> 1:21:51.140
 And Mao said at one point, who cares if millions die?

1:21:52.820 --> 1:21:53.940
 It just doesn't matter.

1:21:53.940 --> 1:21:55.340
 We've got millions more left.

1:21:55.340 --> 1:21:57.820
 I mean, he would periodically say things like this

1:21:57.820 --> 1:22:02.820
 that showed that like Stalin, he had total indifference

1:22:03.140 --> 1:22:06.340
 to the fact that people were dying in large numbers.

1:22:06.340 --> 1:22:08.140
 It led again to cannibalism

1:22:08.140 --> 1:22:13.140
 and to terrible wastage all over the country

1:22:13.780 --> 1:22:15.060
 and millions of people died

1:22:15.060 --> 1:22:17.180
 and there was just no stopping it.

1:22:18.180 --> 1:22:19.260
 There were people in the party

1:22:19.260 --> 1:22:22.620
 who began to kind of edge towards telling Mao

1:22:22.620 --> 1:22:26.260
 this wasn't a great idea and that he should back off,

1:22:26.260 --> 1:22:28.460
 but he wouldn't back off.

1:22:28.460 --> 1:22:32.060
 And the result was catastrophe in the countryside

1:22:32.060 --> 1:22:33.220
 and all these people dying.

1:22:33.220 --> 1:22:38.180
 And then compounding the problem was the political elite,

1:22:38.180 --> 1:22:41.140
 which then if peasants would object

1:22:41.140 --> 1:22:43.340
 or if certain people would say,

1:22:43.340 --> 1:22:45.020
 no, they'd beat the hell out of them.

1:22:45.020 --> 1:22:47.860
 They would beat people who didn't do

1:22:47.860 --> 1:22:49.140
 what they wanted them to do.

1:22:49.140 --> 1:22:54.140
 So it was really, really a horrific set of events

1:22:54.980 --> 1:22:59.220
 on the Chinese countryside.

1:22:59.220 --> 1:23:02.540
 I mean, and people wrote about it.

1:23:02.540 --> 1:23:04.460
 I mean, we learned about it.

1:23:04.460 --> 1:23:05.940
 There were people who were keeping track

1:23:05.940 --> 1:23:09.100
 of what was going on and eventually wrote books about it.

1:23:09.100 --> 1:23:13.020
 So we have, I mean, we have pretty good documentation,

1:23:13.020 --> 1:23:14.140
 not so much on the numbers.

1:23:14.140 --> 1:23:17.700
 Numbers are always a difficult problem.

1:23:17.700 --> 1:23:19.100
 I'm facing this problem, by the way,

1:23:19.100 --> 1:23:23.100
 this is a little bit separate with the Holodomor,

1:23:23.100 --> 1:23:25.060
 where Ukrainians are now claiming

1:23:25.060 --> 1:23:27.980
 11.5 million people died in Holodomor.

1:23:27.980 --> 1:23:29.740
 And most people assume it's somewhere

1:23:29.740 --> 1:23:33.180
 in the neighborhood of four million, 4.5 million maybe.

1:23:33.180 --> 1:23:36.380
 So you have wildly different numbers that come out.

1:23:36.380 --> 1:23:37.900
 Then we have different kinds of numbers,

1:23:37.900 --> 1:23:41.540
 as you mentioned too, with the Great Leap Forward.

1:23:41.540 --> 1:23:45.220
 So it was a huge catastrophe for China

1:23:45.220 --> 1:23:47.820
 and now only backed off when he had to.

1:23:47.820 --> 1:23:50.620
 And then revived a little bit

1:23:50.620 --> 1:23:53.860
 with the Red Guards Movement later on

1:23:53.860 --> 1:23:57.980
 when he was upset that the bureaucracy

1:23:57.980 --> 1:24:00.260
 was resisting him a little bit

1:24:00.260 --> 1:24:01.620
 when it came to the Great Leap.

1:24:01.620 --> 1:24:03.260
 But he had to back off.

1:24:03.260 --> 1:24:05.940
 It was such a terrible catastrophe.

1:24:05.940 --> 1:24:07.620
 So one of the things about numbers

1:24:07.620 --> 1:24:10.380
 is that you usually talk about deaths,

1:24:10.380 --> 1:24:13.300
 but with the famine, with starvation,

1:24:14.780 --> 1:24:16.820
 the thing I often think about

1:24:16.820 --> 1:24:18.580
 that's impossible to put into numbers

1:24:18.580 --> 1:24:20.100
 is the number of people

1:24:21.180 --> 1:24:24.020
 and the degree to which they were suffering.

1:24:24.020 --> 1:24:28.780
 You know, the number of days spent in suffering.

1:24:28.780 --> 1:24:30.020
 Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1:24:30.020 --> 1:24:31.700
 And so, I mean, death is,

1:24:36.300 --> 1:24:39.700
 death is just one of the consequences of suffering.

1:24:39.700 --> 1:24:43.740
 To me, it feels like one, two, three years or months

1:24:43.740 --> 1:24:48.740
 and then years of not having anything to eat is worse.

1:24:51.780 --> 1:24:55.260
 And those aren't put into numbers often.

1:24:55.260 --> 1:24:56.100
 That's right.

1:24:56.100 --> 1:24:57.940
 And the effect on people long term,

1:24:57.940 --> 1:24:59.540
 you know, in terms of their mental health,

1:24:59.540 --> 1:25:02.540
 in terms of their physical health,

1:25:02.540 --> 1:25:05.180
 their ability to work, all those kinds of things.

1:25:05.180 --> 1:25:07.180
 I mean, Ukrainians are working on,

1:25:07.180 --> 1:25:09.260
 there are people working on this subject now.

1:25:09.260 --> 1:25:13.020
 You know, the longterm effect of the hunger famine on them.

1:25:13.020 --> 1:25:16.220
 And I'm sure there's a similar kind of longterm effect

1:25:16.220 --> 1:25:18.100
 on Chinese peasantry of what happened.

1:25:18.100 --> 1:25:20.060
 You know, I mean, you're destroying.

1:25:20.060 --> 1:25:21.020
 Multigenerational.

1:25:21.020 --> 1:25:22.300
 Yes, multigenerational.

1:25:22.300 --> 1:25:23.620
 That's right, that's right.

1:25:23.620 --> 1:25:26.580
 And you know, it's a really, you're absolutely right.

1:25:26.580 --> 1:25:29.140
 This is a terrible, terrible way to die.

1:25:29.140 --> 1:25:31.500
 And it lasts a long time.

1:25:31.500 --> 1:25:34.340
 And sometimes you don't die, you survive,

1:25:34.340 --> 1:25:37.220
 but you know, in the kind of shape

1:25:37.220 --> 1:25:39.780
 where you can't do anything.

1:25:39.780 --> 1:25:42.060
 I mean, you can't function.

1:25:42.060 --> 1:25:44.900
 Now your brain's been injured, you know.

1:25:44.900 --> 1:25:49.180
 I know it's a really, these famines are really horrible.

1:25:49.180 --> 1:25:50.020
 You're right.

1:25:50.020 --> 1:25:50.980
 So when you talk about genocide,

1:25:50.980 --> 1:25:52.620
 it's often talking about murder.

1:25:52.620 --> 1:25:55.180
 Where do you place North Korea in this discussion?

1:25:55.180 --> 1:25:56.940
 We kind of mentioned it.

1:25:56.940 --> 1:25:58.860
 So in the, what is it?

1:25:58.860 --> 1:26:03.860
 The Arduous March of the 1990s,

1:26:03.860 --> 1:26:08.340
 where it was mass starvation.

1:26:08.340 --> 1:26:10.860
 Many people describe mass starvation

1:26:10.860 --> 1:26:13.140
 going on now in North Korea.

1:26:13.140 --> 1:26:14.340
 When you think about genocide,

1:26:14.340 --> 1:26:18.740
 when you think about atrocities going on in the world today,

1:26:18.740 --> 1:26:20.740
 where do you place North Korea?

1:26:20.740 --> 1:26:22.300
 So take a step back.

1:26:22.300 --> 1:26:24.780
 When the, there were all these courts

1:26:24.780 --> 1:26:28.180
 that were set up for Bosnia and for Rwanda

1:26:28.180 --> 1:26:34.060
 and for other genocides in the 1990s.

1:26:34.060 --> 1:26:37.340
 And then the decision was made

1:26:37.340 --> 1:26:39.860
 by the international community, UN basically,

1:26:39.860 --> 1:26:43.100
 to set up the International Criminal Court,

1:26:43.100 --> 1:26:47.500
 which would then try genocide in the more modern period

1:26:47.500 --> 1:26:49.540
 and the more contemporary period.

1:26:49.540 --> 1:26:54.540
 And the ICC lists three crimes basically.

1:26:54.540 --> 1:26:59.540
 The genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes.

1:27:03.100 --> 1:27:07.180
 And subsumed to crimes against humanity

1:27:07.180 --> 1:27:08.660
 are a lot of the kinds of things

1:27:08.660 --> 1:27:10.780
 you're talking about with North Korea.

1:27:10.780 --> 1:27:13.700
 I mean, it's torture, it's artificial,

1:27:13.700 --> 1:27:16.900
 sometimes artificial famine or famine,

1:27:16.900 --> 1:27:21.060
 that is not necessary, right?

1:27:21.060 --> 1:27:22.980
 Not necessary to have it.

1:27:22.980 --> 1:27:26.020
 And there are other kinds of, you know,

1:27:26.020 --> 1:27:28.340
 mass rape and stuff like that.

1:27:28.340 --> 1:27:31.140
 There are other kinds of things that fit

1:27:31.140 --> 1:27:33.460
 into the crimes against humanity.

1:27:33.460 --> 1:27:36.380
 And that's sort of where I think about North Korea

1:27:36.380 --> 1:27:39.180
 as committing crimes against humanity, not genocide.

1:27:39.180 --> 1:27:43.180
 And again, remember, genocide is meant to be,

1:27:44.660 --> 1:27:46.860
 I mean, some people, there's a disagreement

1:27:46.860 --> 1:27:48.820
 among scholars and jurists about this.

1:27:48.820 --> 1:27:51.900
 Some people think of genocide as the crime of crimes,

1:27:51.900 --> 1:27:55.140
 the worst of the three that I just mentioned.

1:27:55.140 --> 1:27:56.980
 But some think of them as co equal.

1:27:56.980 --> 1:28:00.460
 And the ICC, the International Criminal Court,

1:28:00.460 --> 1:28:03.300
 is dealing with them more or less as co equal,

1:28:03.300 --> 1:28:06.500
 even though we tend to think of genocide as the worst.

1:28:06.500 --> 1:28:08.940
 So I mean, what I'm trying to say is that,

1:28:08.940 --> 1:28:11.660
 you know, I don't wanna split hairs.

1:28:11.660 --> 1:28:15.460
 I think it's sort of morally and ethically unseemly,

1:28:15.460 --> 1:28:18.020
 you know, the split hairs about what is genocide,

1:28:18.020 --> 1:28:20.700
 what is the crime against humanity.

1:28:20.700 --> 1:28:22.980
 You know, this is for lawyers, not for historians.

1:28:22.980 --> 1:28:24.100
 But terminology wise.

1:28:24.100 --> 1:28:28.340
 Yeah, yeah, you know, you don't wanna get into that.

1:28:28.340 --> 1:28:32.180
 Because it, I mean, it happened with Darfur a little bit,

1:28:32.180 --> 1:28:35.660
 where the Bush administration had declared

1:28:35.660 --> 1:28:37.820
 that Darfur was a genocide.

1:28:37.820 --> 1:28:41.700
 And the UN said, no, no, it wasn't genocide,

1:28:41.700 --> 1:28:43.380
 it was a crime against humanity.

1:28:43.380 --> 1:28:45.260
 And then, you know, that confused things

1:28:45.260 --> 1:28:47.260
 versus clarified them.

1:28:47.260 --> 1:28:49.300
 I mean, we damn well knew what was happening.

1:28:49.300 --> 1:28:51.500
 People were being killed and being attacked.

1:28:52.500 --> 1:28:55.220
 And so, you know, on the one hand,

1:28:55.220 --> 1:28:58.340
 I think the whole concept and the way of thinking

1:28:59.820 --> 1:29:04.060
 about history using genocide as an important part

1:29:04.060 --> 1:29:08.020
 of human history is crucial.

1:29:08.020 --> 1:29:12.700
 On the other hand, I don't like to, you know,

1:29:12.700 --> 1:29:13.900
 get involved in the hair splitting,

1:29:13.900 --> 1:29:15.340
 what's genocide and what's not.

1:29:15.340 --> 1:29:18.580
 So that, you know, North Korea, I tend to think of,

1:29:18.580 --> 1:29:22.620
 like I said, as committing crimes against humanity

1:29:22.620 --> 1:29:25.540
 and, you know, forcibly incarcerating people,

1:29:25.540 --> 1:29:28.100
 torturing them, that kind of thing.

1:29:28.100 --> 1:29:30.940
 You know, routinely incarcerating, depriving them

1:29:30.940 --> 1:29:33.620
 of certain kinds of human rights

1:29:33.620 --> 1:29:35.700
 can be considered a crime against humanity.

1:29:35.700 --> 1:29:37.980
 But I don't think of it in the same way

1:29:37.980 --> 1:29:39.940
 I think about genocide, which is an attack

1:29:39.940 --> 1:29:40.780
 on a group of people.

1:29:40.780 --> 1:29:42.780
 Let me just leave it at that.

1:29:42.780 --> 1:29:45.820
 What in this, if we think about, if it's okay,

1:29:45.820 --> 1:29:48.140
 can we loosely use the term genocide here,

1:29:48.140 --> 1:29:50.860
 just let's not play games with terminology.

1:29:50.860 --> 1:29:54.700
 Just bad crimes against humanity.

1:29:56.900 --> 1:29:58.620
 Of particular interest are the ones

1:29:58.620 --> 1:30:01.620
 that are going on today still,

1:30:01.620 --> 1:30:04.460
 because it raises the question to us,

1:30:04.460 --> 1:30:07.940
 what do people outside of this,

1:30:07.940 --> 1:30:09.300
 what role do they have to play?

1:30:09.300 --> 1:30:12.380
 So what role does the United States,

1:30:12.380 --> 1:30:18.700
 or what role do I, as a human being who has food today,

1:30:18.700 --> 1:30:21.420
 who has shelter, who has a comfortable life,

1:30:21.420 --> 1:30:26.100
 what role do I have when I think about North Korea,

1:30:26.100 --> 1:30:27.340
 when I think about Syria,

1:30:27.340 --> 1:30:31.420
 when I think about maybe the Uighur population in China?

1:30:33.140 --> 1:30:36.060
 Well, I mean, the role is the same role I have,

1:30:36.060 --> 1:30:38.380
 which is to teach and to learn

1:30:38.380 --> 1:30:43.380
 and to get the message out that this is happening,

1:30:43.620 --> 1:30:45.740
 because the more people who understand it,

1:30:45.740 --> 1:30:48.580
 the more likely it is that the United States government

1:30:48.580 --> 1:30:50.620
 will try to do something about it,

1:30:53.460 --> 1:30:56.660
 within the context of who we are and where we live, right?

1:30:56.660 --> 1:31:00.860
 And so, I write books, you do shows,

1:31:02.020 --> 1:31:04.620
 or maybe you write books too, I don't know.

1:31:04.620 --> 1:31:08.500
 I do not write books, but I tweet.

1:31:08.500 --> 1:31:09.700
 Okay, that's good too.

1:31:09.700 --> 1:31:11.380
 Ineloquently, but that's not the,

1:31:11.380 --> 1:31:14.300
 I guess that's not the, yes, so certainly this is true.

1:31:14.300 --> 1:31:17.020
 And in terms of a voice, in terms of words,

1:31:17.020 --> 1:31:19.420
 in terms of books, you are, I would say,

1:31:19.420 --> 1:31:21.220
 a rare example of somebody

1:31:21.220 --> 1:31:25.060
 that has powerful reach with words.

1:31:25.060 --> 1:31:27.180
 But I was also referring to actions.

1:31:28.300 --> 1:31:31.780
 In the United States government, what are the options here?

1:31:31.780 --> 1:31:35.140
 So, war has costs,

1:31:35.140 --> 1:31:39.100
 and war seems to be, as you have described,

1:31:39.100 --> 1:31:43.260
 sort of potentially increase the atrocity, not decrease it.

1:31:44.380 --> 1:31:48.460
 If there's anything that challenges my hope for the future

1:31:48.460 --> 1:31:52.940
 is the fact that sometimes we're not powerless to help,

1:31:52.940 --> 1:31:55.980
 but very close to powerless to help,

1:31:55.980 --> 1:32:00.260
 because trying to help can often lead to,

1:32:00.260 --> 1:32:04.660
 in the near term, more negative effects than positive effects.

1:32:04.660 --> 1:32:05.620
 That's exactly right.

1:32:05.620 --> 1:32:10.180
 I mean, the unintended consequences of what we do

1:32:10.180 --> 1:32:13.540
 can frequently be as bad, if not worse,

1:32:13.540 --> 1:32:17.060
 than trying to relieve the difficulties

1:32:17.060 --> 1:32:17.900
 that people are having.

1:32:17.900 --> 1:32:21.500
 So I think you're caught a little bit,

1:32:21.500 --> 1:32:25.220
 but it's also true, I think, that we can be more forceful.

1:32:25.220 --> 1:32:29.620
 I think we can be more forceful without necessarily war.

1:32:29.620 --> 1:32:33.700
 There is this idea of the so called responsibility

1:32:33.700 --> 1:32:37.820
 to protect, and this was an idea that came up

1:32:37.820 --> 1:32:42.820
 after Kosovo, which was what, 1999,

1:32:42.820 --> 1:32:47.820
 and when the Serbs looked like they were going to engage

1:32:48.500 --> 1:32:50.540
 in a genocidal program in Kosovo,

1:32:50.540 --> 1:32:53.180
 and it was basically a program of ethnic cleansing,

1:32:53.180 --> 1:32:56.220
 but it could have gone bad and gotten worse,

1:32:56.220 --> 1:32:59.540
 not just driving people out, but beginning to kill them.

1:32:59.540 --> 1:33:04.540
 And the United States and Britain and others intervened.

1:33:05.260 --> 1:33:08.860
 And Russians were there too, as you probably recall.

1:33:08.860 --> 1:33:13.860
 And I think correctly, people have analyzed this

1:33:13.940 --> 1:33:18.940
 as a case in which genocide was prevented or stopped.

1:33:19.940 --> 1:33:22.020
 In other words, the Serbs were stopped in their tracks.

1:33:22.020 --> 1:33:23.460
 I mean, some bad things did happen.

1:33:23.460 --> 1:33:25.660
 We bombed Belgrade and the Chinese embassy

1:33:25.660 --> 1:33:27.100
 and things like that.

1:33:27.100 --> 1:33:32.100
 But it was stopped, and following upon that,

1:33:32.340 --> 1:33:35.620
 then there was a kind of international consensus

1:33:35.620 --> 1:33:36.900
 that we needed to do something.

1:33:36.900 --> 1:33:39.500
 I mean, because of Rwanda, Bosnia,

1:33:39.500 --> 1:33:42.580
 and the positive example of Kosovo, right?

1:33:42.580 --> 1:33:46.580
 That genocide did not happen in Kosovo.

1:33:46.580 --> 1:33:50.740
 I think that argument has been substantiated.

1:33:50.740 --> 1:33:55.460
 Anyway, and this notion of the,

1:33:55.460 --> 1:33:58.460
 or this doctrine or whatever,

1:33:58.460 --> 1:34:00.860
 of the responsibility to protect them

1:34:00.860 --> 1:34:05.860
 was adopted by the UN in 2005, unanimously.

1:34:06.500 --> 1:34:11.500
 And what it says is there's a hierarchy of measures

1:34:11.820 --> 1:34:14.980
 that should be, well, let me take a step back.

1:34:14.980 --> 1:34:19.980
 It starts with the principle that sovereignty of a country

1:34:21.060 --> 1:34:24.820
 is not, you don't earn it just by being there

1:34:24.820 --> 1:34:27.300
 and being your own country.

1:34:27.300 --> 1:34:29.900
 You have to earn it by protecting your people.

1:34:30.980 --> 1:34:32.820
 So every, this was all agreed

1:34:32.820 --> 1:34:35.140
 with all the nations of the UN agreed,

1:34:35.140 --> 1:34:37.820
 Chinese and Russians too,

1:34:37.820 --> 1:34:42.820
 that sovereignty is there because you protect your people

1:34:43.340 --> 1:34:46.380
 against various depredations, right?

1:34:46.380 --> 1:34:49.740
 Including genocide, crimes against humanity,

1:34:49.740 --> 1:34:52.820
 forced imprisonment, torture, and that sort of thing.

1:34:52.820 --> 1:34:57.820
 If you violate that justification for your sovereignty,

1:34:59.980 --> 1:35:01.460
 that you're protecting your people,

1:35:01.460 --> 1:35:03.260
 that you're not protecting them,

1:35:03.260 --> 1:35:06.860
 the international community has the obligation

1:35:06.860 --> 1:35:09.020
 to do something about it, all right?

1:35:09.900 --> 1:35:11.860
 Now, then they have a kind of hierarchy

1:35:11.860 --> 1:35:14.180
 of things you can do, you know, starting with,

1:35:15.220 --> 1:35:17.020
 I mean, I'm not quoting exactly,

1:35:17.020 --> 1:35:19.380
 but, you know, starting with kind of push and pull,

1:35:19.380 --> 1:35:20.860
 you know, trying to convince people,

1:35:20.860 --> 1:35:23.380
 don't do that, you know, to Myanmar,

1:35:23.380 --> 1:35:26.020
 don't do that to the Rohingya people, right?

1:35:27.780 --> 1:35:29.500
 Then it goes down the list, you know,

1:35:29.500 --> 1:35:32.300
 and you get to sanctions or threatening sanctions

1:35:32.300 --> 1:35:36.700
 and then sanctions, you know, like we have against Russia,

1:35:36.700 --> 1:35:38.540
 but you go down the list, right?

1:35:38.540 --> 1:35:41.220
 You go down the list and eventually

1:35:42.260 --> 1:35:44.380
 you get to military intervention at the bottom,

1:35:44.380 --> 1:35:46.860
 which they say is the last thing, you know,

1:35:46.860 --> 1:35:50.100
 and you really don't wanna do that.

1:35:50.100 --> 1:35:52.020
 And not only do you not wanna do it,

1:35:52.020 --> 1:35:54.740
 but it, just as you said, just as you pointed out,

1:35:54.740 --> 1:35:58.180
 it can have unintended consequences, right?

1:35:58.180 --> 1:36:01.460
 And we'll do everything we can short,

1:36:01.460 --> 1:36:03.420
 you know, of military intervention,

1:36:03.420 --> 1:36:06.300
 but, you know, if necessary,

1:36:06.300 --> 1:36:09.140
 that can be undertaken as well.

1:36:09.140 --> 1:36:11.140
 And so the responsibility to predict, I think,

1:36:11.140 --> 1:36:16.060
 is, you know, it was not implementable.

1:36:16.060 --> 1:36:20.620
 Oh, one of the things it says in this last category, right?

1:36:20.620 --> 1:36:23.500
 The military intervention is that the intervention

1:36:23.500 --> 1:36:28.500
 cannot create more damage than it relieves, right?

1:36:29.020 --> 1:36:34.020
 And so for Syria, we came to the conclusion,

1:36:34.500 --> 1:36:36.740
 you know, that, I mean, the international community

1:36:36.740 --> 1:36:39.620
 in some ways said this in so many words,

1:36:39.620 --> 1:36:41.460
 even though the Russians were there, obviously,

1:36:41.460 --> 1:36:43.220
 we ended up being there and that sort of thing,

1:36:43.220 --> 1:36:45.420
 but the international community basically said,

1:36:45.420 --> 1:36:48.220
 you know, there's no way you can intervene in Syria.

1:36:48.220 --> 1:36:52.100
 You know, there's just no way without causing more damage,

1:36:52.100 --> 1:36:54.220
 you know, than you would relieve.

1:36:54.220 --> 1:36:56.820
 So, you know, in some senses,

1:36:56.820 --> 1:36:58.460
 that's what the international community is saying

1:36:58.460 --> 1:37:02.060
 about, you know, Xinjiang and the Uighurs too.

1:37:02.060 --> 1:37:04.740
 You know, I mean, you can't even imagine

1:37:05.660 --> 1:37:07.100
 what hell would break loose

1:37:07.100 --> 1:37:10.300
 if there was some kind of military trouble, you know,

1:37:10.300 --> 1:37:12.740
 to threaten the Chinese with.

1:37:12.740 --> 1:37:16.340
 But you can go down that list

1:37:16.340 --> 1:37:19.740
 with the, you know, the military leadership of Myanmar,

1:37:19.740 --> 1:37:21.140
 and you can go down that list

1:37:21.140 --> 1:37:23.460
 with the Chinese Communist Party,

1:37:23.460 --> 1:37:25.460
 and you can go down the list, you know,

1:37:25.460 --> 1:37:30.460
 with others who are threatening, you know, with Ethiopia

1:37:31.300 --> 1:37:33.860
 and what it's doing in Tigray.

1:37:33.860 --> 1:37:37.900
 And, you know, you can go down that list and start pushing.

1:37:37.900 --> 1:37:39.220
 I think what happened,

1:37:39.220 --> 1:37:44.220
 you know, there was more of a willingness in the 90s,

1:37:44.380 --> 1:37:47.660
 and in, you know, right at the turn of the century,

1:37:48.860 --> 1:37:50.780
 you know, to do these kinds of things.

1:37:50.780 --> 1:37:53.260
 And then, you know, when Trump got elected and, you know,

1:37:53.260 --> 1:37:55.380
 he basically said, you know, America first

1:37:55.380 --> 1:37:56.260
 and out of the world,

1:37:56.260 --> 1:37:58.620
 we're not gonna do any of this kind of stuff.

1:37:58.620 --> 1:38:00.780
 And now Biden has the problem

1:38:00.780 --> 1:38:02.460
 of trying to rebuild consensus

1:38:02.460 --> 1:38:06.740
 on how you deal with these kinds of things.

1:38:06.740 --> 1:38:08.660
 I think it's not impossible.

1:38:08.660 --> 1:38:12.500
 I mean, here I tend to be maybe more of an optimist than you.

1:38:12.500 --> 1:38:14.540
 You know, I think it's not impossible

1:38:14.540 --> 1:38:16.700
 that the international community can, you know,

1:38:16.700 --> 1:38:20.620
 muster some internal fortitude

1:38:20.620 --> 1:38:25.620
 and push harder, short of war, you know,

1:38:25.660 --> 1:38:30.660
 to get the Chinese and to get the, again, Myanmar,

1:38:30.860 --> 1:38:34.100
 and to get others to kind of back off

1:38:34.100 --> 1:38:36.020
 of violations of people's rights

1:38:36.020 --> 1:38:38.300
 the way they are routinely doing it.

1:38:38.300 --> 1:38:39.980
 So that's in the space of geopolitics.

1:38:39.980 --> 1:38:42.820
 That's the space of politicians and UN and so on.

1:38:42.820 --> 1:38:44.420
 The interesting thing about China,

1:38:44.420 --> 1:38:47.020
 and this is a difficult topic,

1:38:47.020 --> 1:38:52.020
 but there's so many financial interests

1:38:53.540 --> 1:38:58.540
 that not many voices with power and with money

1:38:59.380 --> 1:39:02.340
 speak up, speak out against China

1:39:03.460 --> 1:39:06.700
 because it's a very interesting effect

1:39:06.700 --> 1:39:11.140
 because it costs a lot for an individual to speak up

1:39:12.260 --> 1:39:13.820
 because you're going to suffer.

1:39:13.820 --> 1:39:16.980
 I mean, China just cuts off the market.

1:39:16.980 --> 1:39:19.980
 Like if you have a product, if you have a company

1:39:19.980 --> 1:39:22.780
 and you say something negative, China just says, okay,

1:39:22.780 --> 1:39:25.100
 well then they knock you out of the market.

1:39:25.100 --> 1:39:27.420
 And so any person that speaks up,

1:39:27.420 --> 1:39:29.780
 they get shut down immediately financially.

1:39:29.780 --> 1:39:33.180
 It's a huge cost, sometimes millions or billions of dollars.

1:39:33.180 --> 1:39:36.540
 And so what happens is everybody of consequences,

1:39:36.540 --> 1:39:39.540
 sort of financially, everybody with a giant platform

1:39:39.540 --> 1:39:41.260
 is extremely hesitant to speak out.

1:39:41.260 --> 1:39:45.260
 It's a very, it's a different kind of hesitation

1:39:45.260 --> 1:39:46.820
 that's financial in nature.

1:39:46.820 --> 1:39:48.700
 I don't know if that was always the case.

1:39:48.700 --> 1:39:52.380
 It seems like in history, people were quiet

1:39:52.380 --> 1:39:55.860
 because of fear, because of a threat of violence.

1:39:55.860 --> 1:39:58.380
 Here, there's almost like a self interested

1:39:59.940 --> 1:40:04.300
 preservation of financial, of wealth.

1:40:04.300 --> 1:40:06.220
 And I don't know what to do that.

1:40:06.220 --> 1:40:09.380
 I mean, I don't know if you can say something there,

1:40:09.380 --> 1:40:14.380
 like the genocide going on

1:40:14.380 --> 1:40:17.340
 because people are financially self interested.

1:40:18.340 --> 1:40:21.980
 Yeah, no, I think, I mean, I think the analysis is correct.

1:40:21.980 --> 1:40:26.100
 And it's not only, but it's not only corporations,

1:40:26.100 --> 1:40:28.180
 but it's the American government

1:40:28.180 --> 1:40:30.300
 that represents the American people

1:40:30.300 --> 1:40:35.300
 that also feels compelled not to challenge the Chinese

1:40:37.940 --> 1:40:39.300
 on human rights issues.

1:40:39.300 --> 1:40:41.900
 But the interesting thing is it's not just,

1:40:41.900 --> 1:40:44.340
 you know, I know a lot of people from China

1:40:44.340 --> 1:40:47.060
 and first of all, amazing human beings

1:40:47.060 --> 1:40:49.020
 and a lot of brilliant people in China,

1:40:49.020 --> 1:40:50.860
 they also don't want to speak out

1:40:50.860 --> 1:40:52.980
 and not because they're sort of quote unquote,

1:40:52.980 --> 1:40:56.140
 like silenced, but more because they're going

1:40:56.140 --> 1:40:58.500
 to also lose financially.

1:40:58.500 --> 1:41:00.580
 They have a lot of businesses in China.

1:41:00.580 --> 1:41:02.500
 They, you know, they're running,

1:41:02.500 --> 1:41:06.700
 in fact, the Chinese government and the country

1:41:06.700 --> 1:41:08.460
 has a very interesting structure

1:41:08.460 --> 1:41:11.340
 because it has a lot of elements that enable capitalism

1:41:11.340 --> 1:41:13.820
 within a certain framework.

1:41:13.820 --> 1:41:16.540
 So you have a lot of very successful companies

1:41:16.540 --> 1:41:18.180
 and they operate successfully.

1:41:18.180 --> 1:41:19.900
 And then the leaders of those companies,

1:41:19.900 --> 1:41:24.620
 many of whom have either been on this podcast,

1:41:24.620 --> 1:41:25.900
 or want to be on this podcast,

1:41:25.900 --> 1:41:28.180
 they really don't want to say anything negative

1:41:28.180 --> 1:41:29.380
 about the government.

1:41:29.380 --> 1:41:32.740
 And the nature of the fear I sense

1:41:32.740 --> 1:41:37.300
 is not the kind of fear you would have in Nazi Germany.

1:41:37.300 --> 1:41:40.180
 It's a very kind of, it's a mellow,

1:41:40.180 --> 1:41:44.940
 like why would I speak out when it has a negative effect

1:41:44.940 --> 1:41:47.460
 on my company, on my family, in terms of finance,

1:41:47.460 --> 1:41:48.660
 strictly financially.

1:41:50.060 --> 1:41:53.860
 And that's difficult.

1:41:53.860 --> 1:41:56.020
 That's a different problem to solve.

1:41:56.020 --> 1:41:57.620
 That feels solvable.

1:41:57.620 --> 1:42:00.060
 It feels like it's a money problem.

1:42:00.060 --> 1:42:02.300
 If you can control the flow of money

1:42:03.940 --> 1:42:05.580
 where the government has less power

1:42:05.580 --> 1:42:06.780
 to control the flow of money,

1:42:06.780 --> 1:42:08.740
 it feels like that's solvable.

1:42:08.740 --> 1:42:10.300
 And that's where capitalism is good.

1:42:10.300 --> 1:42:11.540
 That's where a free market is good.

1:42:11.540 --> 1:42:13.180
 So it's like, that's where a lot of people

1:42:13.180 --> 1:42:14.380
 in the cryptocurrency space,

1:42:14.380 --> 1:42:15.980
 I don't know if you follow them,

1:42:15.980 --> 1:42:19.660
 they kind of say, okay, take the monetary system,

1:42:19.660 --> 1:42:22.500
 the power to control money away from governments.

1:42:22.500 --> 1:42:23.420
 Make it a distributed,

1:42:23.420 --> 1:42:26.300
 like allow technology to help you with that.

1:42:26.300 --> 1:42:28.700
 That's a hopeful message there.

1:42:28.700 --> 1:42:29.980
 In fact, a lot of people argue

1:42:29.980 --> 1:42:31.940
 that kind of Bitcoin and these cryptocurrencies

1:42:31.940 --> 1:42:36.940
 can help deal with some of these authoritarian regimes

1:42:38.460 --> 1:42:41.860
 that lead to violations of basic human rights.

1:42:41.860 --> 1:42:44.300
 If you can control, if you can give the power

1:42:44.300 --> 1:42:46.060
 to control the money to the people,

1:42:46.060 --> 1:42:47.940
 you can take that away from governments.

1:42:47.940 --> 1:42:49.700
 That's another source of hope

1:42:49.700 --> 1:42:52.740
 where technology might be able to do something good.

1:42:52.740 --> 1:42:54.820
 That's something different about the 21st century

1:42:54.820 --> 1:42:57.100
 than the 20th is there's technology

1:42:57.100 --> 1:42:59.700
 in the hands of billions of people.

1:42:59.700 --> 1:43:01.700
 I mean, I have to say,

1:43:01.700 --> 1:43:04.660
 I think you're a naive when it comes to technology.

1:43:04.660 --> 1:43:07.900
 I mean, I don't, I'm not someone who understands technology.

1:43:07.900 --> 1:43:11.620
 So it's wrong of me to argue with you

1:43:11.620 --> 1:43:13.820
 because I don't really spend much time with it.

1:43:13.820 --> 1:43:15.940
 I don't really like it very much.

1:43:15.940 --> 1:43:20.940
 And I'm not, I'm neither a fan nor a connoisseur.

1:43:21.060 --> 1:43:23.860
 So I just don't really know.

1:43:23.860 --> 1:43:27.700
 But what human history has shown basically,

1:43:27.700 --> 1:43:28.980
 and that's a big statement.

1:43:28.980 --> 1:43:31.020
 I don't wanna pretend I can tell you

1:43:31.020 --> 1:43:32.860
 what human history has shown.

1:43:32.860 --> 1:43:37.180
 But technology, atom bomb,

1:43:37.180 --> 1:43:39.780
 I mean, that's a perfect example of technology.

1:43:39.780 --> 1:43:42.100
 What happens when you discover new things?

1:43:42.100 --> 1:43:43.300
 It's a perfect example.

1:43:43.300 --> 1:43:45.020
 What's going on with Facebook now?

1:43:45.020 --> 1:43:47.980
 It's an absolutely perfect example.

1:43:47.980 --> 1:43:52.260
 And I once went to a lecture by Eric Schmidt

1:43:52.260 --> 1:43:54.700
 about the future and about all the things

1:43:54.700 --> 1:43:57.060
 that were gonna happen and all these wonderful things

1:43:57.060 --> 1:43:59.860
 like you wouldn't have to translate yourself anything,

1:43:59.860 --> 1:44:02.780
 you wouldn't have to read a book,

1:44:02.780 --> 1:44:04.140
 you wouldn't have to drive a car,

1:44:04.140 --> 1:44:05.660
 you don't have to do this, you don't have to do that.

1:44:05.660 --> 1:44:07.340
 What kind of life is that?

1:44:07.340 --> 1:44:12.020
 So my view of technology is it's subsumed

1:44:13.220 --> 1:44:18.140
 to the political, social and moral needs of our day

1:44:18.140 --> 1:44:20.340
 and should be subsumed to that day.

1:44:20.340 --> 1:44:22.340
 It's not gonna solve anything by itself.

1:44:22.340 --> 1:44:25.460
 It's gonna be you and me that solve things.

1:44:25.460 --> 1:44:27.420
 If they're solved, there are political system

1:44:27.420 --> 1:44:28.380
 that solve things.

1:44:28.380 --> 1:44:31.420
 Technology is neutral on one level.

1:44:31.420 --> 1:44:35.060
 It is simply a human, I mean, they're talking now

1:44:35.060 --> 1:44:38.180
 about how artificial intelligence is gonna do this

1:44:38.180 --> 1:44:39.780
 and is gonna do that.

1:44:39.780 --> 1:44:43.620
 I'm not so sure there's anything necessarily positive

1:44:43.620 --> 1:44:46.220
 or negative about it except it does obviously

1:44:46.220 --> 1:44:48.660
 make work easier and things like that.

1:44:48.660 --> 1:44:53.660
 I mean, I like email and I like word processing

1:44:53.940 --> 1:44:56.180
 and all that stuff is great,

1:44:56.180 --> 1:45:01.180
 but actually solving human relations in and of itself

1:45:04.420 --> 1:45:09.420
 or international relations or conflict among human beings.

1:45:11.580 --> 1:45:14.860
 I mean, I see technology as causing as many problems

1:45:14.860 --> 1:45:18.460
 as it solves and maybe even more.

1:45:18.460 --> 1:45:19.300
 You know, the kind.

1:45:19.300 --> 1:45:20.140
 Maybe.

1:45:20.140 --> 1:45:20.980
 Maybe even more. Maybe.

1:45:20.980 --> 1:45:21.820
 Yeah.

1:45:21.820 --> 1:45:25.220
 The question is, so like you said, technology is neutral.

1:45:25.220 --> 1:45:26.900
 I agree with this.

1:45:26.900 --> 1:45:31.900
 Technology is a toolkit, is a tool set that enables humans

1:45:32.460 --> 1:45:36.700
 to have wider reach and more power, the printing press.

1:45:36.700 --> 1:45:41.380
 The rare reason I can read your books is I would argue,

1:45:41.380 --> 1:45:45.540
 so first of all, the printing press and then the internet.

1:45:45.540 --> 1:45:50.540
 Wikipedia, I think, has immeasurable effect on humanity.

1:45:52.020 --> 1:45:53.900
 Technology is a double edged sword.

1:45:53.900 --> 1:45:57.260
 It allows bad people to do bad things

1:45:57.260 --> 1:45:58.780
 and good people to do good things.

1:45:58.780 --> 1:46:02.780
 It ultimately boils down to the people

1:46:02.780 --> 1:46:05.700
 and whether you believe the capacity for good

1:46:05.700 --> 1:46:07.460
 outweighs the capacity of bad.

1:46:07.460 --> 1:46:09.820
 And so you said that I'm naive.

1:46:09.820 --> 1:46:10.660
 It is true.

1:46:10.660 --> 1:46:12.340
 I'm naively optimistic.

1:46:12.340 --> 1:46:16.020
 I would say you're naively cynical about technology.

1:46:16.020 --> 1:46:20.460
 Here we have one overdressed naive optimist

1:46:20.460 --> 1:46:23.780
 and one brilliant, but nevertheless,

1:46:23.780 --> 1:46:27.060
 technologically naive cynic and we don't know.

1:46:27.060 --> 1:46:30.340
 We don't know whether the capacity for good

1:46:30.340 --> 1:46:34.860
 or the capacity for evil wins out in the end.

1:46:34.860 --> 1:46:37.060
 And like we've been talking about,

1:46:37.060 --> 1:46:39.940
 the trajectory of human history seems to pivot

1:46:39.940 --> 1:46:43.060
 in a lot of random seeming moments.

1:46:43.060 --> 1:46:45.020
 So we don't know.

1:46:45.020 --> 1:46:50.020
 But as a builder of technology, I remain optimistic.

1:46:51.020 --> 1:46:56.020
 And I should say kind of when you are optimistic,

1:46:56.220 --> 1:47:01.060
 it is often easy to sound naive.

1:47:02.780 --> 1:47:06.300
 And I'm not sure what to make of that small effect.

1:47:06.300 --> 1:47:07.780
 Not to linger on specific words,

1:47:07.780 --> 1:47:12.780
 but I've noticed that people who kind of are cynical

1:47:13.540 --> 1:47:18.180
 about the world somehow sound more intelligent.

1:47:18.180 --> 1:47:19.020
 No, no.

1:47:19.020 --> 1:47:23.820
 The issue is how can you be realistic about the world?

1:47:23.820 --> 1:47:25.780
 It's not optimistic or pessimistic.

1:47:25.780 --> 1:47:27.260
 It's not cynical.

1:47:27.260 --> 1:47:29.500
 The question is how can you be a realist, right?

1:47:29.500 --> 1:47:31.140
 Yes, that's a good question.

1:47:31.140 --> 1:47:38.140
 Realism depends on a combination of knowledge and wisdom

1:47:39.340 --> 1:47:42.700
 and good instincts and that sort of thing.

1:47:42.700 --> 1:47:47.340
 And that's what we strive for, is a kind of realism.

1:47:47.340 --> 1:47:49.140
 We both strive for that kind of realism.

1:47:49.140 --> 1:47:53.420
 But I mean, here's an example I would give you.

1:47:53.420 --> 1:47:56.580
 What about, again, we've got this environmental issue,

1:47:56.580 --> 1:47:59.300
 and technology has created it.

1:47:59.300 --> 1:48:01.780
 It's created it.

1:48:01.780 --> 1:48:04.140
 I mean, the growth of technology,

1:48:04.140 --> 1:48:06.980
 I mean, we all like to be heated well in our homes,

1:48:06.980 --> 1:48:11.980
 and we wanna have cars that run quickly and fast on gas.

1:48:11.980 --> 1:48:16.980
 I mean, we're all consumers and we all profit from this.

1:48:16.980 --> 1:48:20.060
 I don't, not everybody profits from it,

1:48:20.060 --> 1:48:23.100
 but we wanna be comfortable.

1:48:23.100 --> 1:48:25.580
 And technology has provided us with a comfortable life.

1:48:25.580 --> 1:48:29.620
 And it's also provided us with this incredible danger,

1:48:29.620 --> 1:48:32.180
 which it's not solving, at least not now.

1:48:32.180 --> 1:48:34.820
 And it may solve, but it may, it's only,

1:48:34.820 --> 1:48:37.700
 my view is, you know what's gonna happen?

1:48:37.700 --> 1:48:39.340
 A horrible catastrophe.

1:48:39.340 --> 1:48:42.260
 It's the only way, it's the only way

1:48:42.260 --> 1:48:44.140
 we will direct ourselves

1:48:44.140 --> 1:48:46.460
 to actually trying to do something about it.

1:48:48.100 --> 1:48:53.100
 We don't have the wisdom and the realism

1:48:53.100 --> 1:48:58.100
 and the sense of purpose, you know, what's her name?

1:48:59.020 --> 1:49:01.580
 Greta goes blah, blah, blah, something like that

1:49:01.580 --> 1:49:04.580
 in her last talk about the environmental summit

1:49:08.020 --> 1:49:09.740
 in Glasgow or whatever it was.

1:49:11.340 --> 1:49:15.900
 And, you know, we just don't have it

1:49:15.900 --> 1:49:19.420
 unless we're hit upside the head really, really hard.

1:49:19.420 --> 1:49:24.420
 And then maybe, you know, the business with nuclear weapons,

1:49:25.460 --> 1:49:27.860
 you know, I think somehow we got hit upside the head

1:49:27.860 --> 1:49:30.380
 and we realized, oh man, you know,

1:49:30.380 --> 1:49:32.940
 this could really do it to the whole world.

1:49:32.940 --> 1:49:36.660
 And so we started, you know, serious arms control stuff.

1:49:36.660 --> 1:49:41.460
 And, you know, but up to that point, you know,

1:49:41.460 --> 1:49:43.500
 I mean, there was just something about, you know,

1:49:43.500 --> 1:49:46.060
 Khrushchev's big bomb, his big hydrogen bomb,

1:49:46.060 --> 1:49:48.340
 which he exploded in the times,

1:49:48.340 --> 1:49:50.420
 I think it was the anniversary or something like that.

1:49:50.420 --> 1:49:52.460
 You know, I mean, just think what we could have done

1:49:52.460 --> 1:49:53.580
 to each other.

1:49:53.580 --> 1:49:55.620
 Well, that's the double edged sword of technology.

1:49:55.620 --> 1:49:57.300
 Yeah, I agree, it's a double edged sword.

1:49:57.300 --> 1:49:59.260
 There's a lot of people, there's a lot of people

1:49:59.260 --> 1:50:01.980
 that argue that nuclear weapons is the reason

1:50:01.980 --> 1:50:03.780
 we haven't had a World War III.

1:50:03.780 --> 1:50:06.860
 So nuclear weapons, the mutually assured destruction

1:50:06.860 --> 1:50:08.540
 leads to a kind of like,

1:50:08.540 --> 1:50:11.220
 we've reached a certain level of destructiveness

1:50:11.220 --> 1:50:15.660
 with our weapons where we were able to catch ourselves,

1:50:15.660 --> 1:50:20.300
 not to create, like you said, hit really hard.

1:50:20.300 --> 1:50:25.300
 This is the interesting question about kind of hard,

1:50:25.580 --> 1:50:28.620
 hard and really hard upside the head.

1:50:28.620 --> 1:50:31.620
 With the environment, I would argue,

1:50:31.620 --> 1:50:33.860
 see, we can't know the future,

1:50:33.860 --> 1:50:36.180
 but I would argue as the pressure builds,

1:50:36.180 --> 1:50:41.180
 there's already, because of this created urgency,

1:50:41.700 --> 1:50:44.580
 the amount of innovation that I've seen

1:50:44.580 --> 1:50:47.180
 that sometimes is unrelated to the environment,

1:50:47.180 --> 1:50:49.940
 but kind of sparked by this urgency,

1:50:49.940 --> 1:50:52.940
 it's been humongous, including the work of Elon Musk,

1:50:52.940 --> 1:50:54.980
 including the work of just,

1:50:54.980 --> 1:50:59.980
 you could argue that the SpaceX

1:51:00.580 --> 1:51:03.580
 and the new exploration of space is kind of sparked

1:51:03.580 --> 1:51:06.020
 by this environmental like urgency.

1:51:06.020 --> 1:51:07.940
 I mean, connected to Tesla and everything they're doing

1:51:07.940 --> 1:51:09.740
 with electric vehicles and so on.

1:51:09.740 --> 1:51:11.260
 There's a huge amount of innovation

1:51:11.260 --> 1:51:12.660
 in the space that's happening.

1:51:12.660 --> 1:51:16.660
 I could see the effect of climate change

1:51:16.660 --> 1:51:19.780
 resulting in more positive innovation

1:51:19.780 --> 1:51:22.700
 that improves the quality of life across the world

1:51:22.700 --> 1:51:26.340
 than the actual catastrophic events that we're describing,

1:51:26.340 --> 1:51:28.420
 which we cannot even currently predict.

1:51:28.420 --> 1:51:29.620
 It's not like there's going to be,

1:51:29.620 --> 1:51:31.540
 there's going to be more extreme weather events.

1:51:31.540 --> 1:51:32.780
 What does that even mean?

1:51:32.780 --> 1:51:35.260
 There's going to be a gradual increase

1:51:35.260 --> 1:51:38.420
 of the level of water.

1:51:38.420 --> 1:51:40.740
 What does that even mean in terms of catastrophic events?

1:51:40.740 --> 1:51:42.260
 It's going to be pretty gradual.

1:51:42.260 --> 1:51:43.460
 There's going to be migration.

1:51:43.460 --> 1:51:45.100
 We can't predict what that means.

1:51:45.100 --> 1:51:47.500
 And in response to that,

1:51:47.500 --> 1:51:52.420
 there's going to be a huge amount of innovators born today

1:51:52.420 --> 1:51:56.820
 that have dreams and that will build devices and inventions

1:51:56.820 --> 1:52:01.700
 and from space to vehicles to in the software world

1:52:01.700 --> 1:52:03.700
 that enable education across the world,

1:52:03.700 --> 1:52:07.740
 all those kinds of things that will on mass, on average,

1:52:07.740 --> 1:52:11.020
 increase the quality of life on average across the world.

1:52:11.020 --> 1:52:14.500
 So it's not at all obvious that these,

1:52:14.500 --> 1:52:16.220
 the things that the technologies

1:52:16.220 --> 1:52:19.940
 that are creating climate change, global warming,

1:52:19.940 --> 1:52:23.500
 are going to have a negative, net negative effect.

1:52:23.500 --> 1:52:24.740
 We don't know this.

1:52:24.740 --> 1:52:28.860
 And I'm kind of inspired by the dreamers,

1:52:28.860 --> 1:52:32.780
 the engineers, the innovators and the entrepreneurs

1:52:32.780 --> 1:52:36.380
 that build, that wake up in the morning,

1:52:36.380 --> 1:52:38.340
 see problems in the world and dream

1:52:38.340 --> 1:52:40.740
 that they're going to be the ones who solve those problems.

1:52:40.740 --> 1:52:42.980
 That's the human spirit.

1:52:42.980 --> 1:52:44.460
 And that I'm not exactly,

1:52:44.460 --> 1:52:46.700
 it is true that we need those deadlines.

1:52:46.700 --> 1:52:48.900
 We need to be freaking out about stuff.

1:52:48.900 --> 1:52:52.060
 And the reason we need to study history

1:52:52.060 --> 1:52:55.060
 and the worst of human history is then we can say,

1:52:55.060 --> 1:52:56.980
 oh shit, this too can happen.

1:52:57.900 --> 1:52:59.340
 It's a slap in the face.

1:52:59.340 --> 1:53:01.380
 It's a wake up call that if you're,

1:53:01.380 --> 1:53:03.580
 if you get complacent, if you get lazy,

1:53:03.580 --> 1:53:04.820
 this is going to happen.

1:53:04.820 --> 1:53:08.340
 And that, listen, there's a lot of really intelligent people,

1:53:08.340 --> 1:53:10.660
 ambitious people, dreamers.

1:53:10.660 --> 1:53:14.740
 Skilled dreamers that build solutions

1:53:14.740 --> 1:53:17.180
 that make sure this stuff doesn't happen anymore.

1:53:17.180 --> 1:53:19.740
 So there's, I think there's reason to be optimistic

1:53:19.740 --> 1:53:21.780
 about technology, not in a naive way.

1:53:21.780 --> 1:53:25.380
 There's an argument to be made in a realistic way

1:53:25.380 --> 1:53:29.220
 that like with technology, we can build a better future.

1:53:29.220 --> 1:53:33.300
 And then Facebook is a lesson in the way Facebook

1:53:33.300 --> 1:53:37.220
 has been done is a lesson how not to do it.

1:53:37.220 --> 1:53:42.220
 And that lesson serves as a guide

1:53:42.420 --> 1:53:44.380
 of how to do it better, how to do it right,

1:53:44.380 --> 1:53:46.540
 how to do it in a positive way.

1:53:46.540 --> 1:53:49.980
 And the same, every single sort of failed technology

1:53:49.980 --> 1:53:53.260
 contains within it the lessons of how to do it better.

1:53:53.260 --> 1:53:55.380
 And I mean, without that,

1:53:56.660 --> 1:54:00.620
 what's the source of hope for human civilization?

1:54:00.620 --> 1:54:05.620
 You know, that, I mean, by way of question,

1:54:05.620 --> 1:54:09.300
 you have truly studied some of the darkest moments

1:54:09.300 --> 1:54:10.300
 in human history.

1:54:11.620 --> 1:54:13.220
 Put on your optimist hat.

1:54:14.380 --> 1:54:15.220
 Where?

1:54:15.220 --> 1:54:16.060
 That one.

1:54:16.060 --> 1:54:16.900
 Yes.

1:54:16.900 --> 1:54:19.660
 There are glimmers of it.

1:54:19.660 --> 1:54:22.300
 Yes, what is your source of hope

1:54:22.300 --> 1:54:24.620
 for the future of human civilization?

1:54:26.020 --> 1:54:31.020
 Well, I think it resides in, you know,

1:54:31.100 --> 1:54:32.460
 some of what you've been saying,

1:54:32.460 --> 1:54:37.460
 which is the, in the persistence of this civilization

1:54:37.700 --> 1:54:42.700
 over time, despite, you know, the incredible setbacks,

1:54:43.180 --> 1:54:45.820
 you know, two enormous world wars, you know,

1:54:45.820 --> 1:54:50.500
 the nuclear standoff, the, you know,

1:54:50.500 --> 1:54:52.740
 the horrible things we're experiencing now

1:54:52.740 --> 1:54:56.060
 with climate change and migration and stuff like that,

1:54:56.060 --> 1:54:58.820
 that despite these things, you know,

1:54:58.820 --> 1:55:02.420
 we are persisting and we are continuing.

1:55:02.420 --> 1:55:04.580
 And like you say, we're continuing to invent

1:55:04.580 --> 1:55:07.700
 and we're continuing to try to solve these problems.

1:55:07.700 --> 1:55:11.300
 And, you know, we're continuing to love as well as hate.

1:55:11.300 --> 1:55:16.300
 And, you know, that, you know, I'm basically,

1:55:17.740 --> 1:55:20.380
 I mean, I have children and grandchildren

1:55:20.380 --> 1:55:23.780
 and I think they're gonna be just fine.

1:55:23.780 --> 1:55:27.700
 You know, I'm not a doom and gloomer, you know,

1:55:27.700 --> 1:55:30.300
 I'm not a Cassandra saying the world is coming to an end.

1:55:30.300 --> 1:55:33.500
 I'm not like that at all, you know,

1:55:33.500 --> 1:55:38.260
 I think that, you know, things will persist.

1:55:38.260 --> 1:55:41.380
 Another, by the way, source of tremendous optimism

1:55:41.380 --> 1:55:45.580
 on my part, the kids I teach, you know,

1:55:45.580 --> 1:55:49.140
 I teach some unbelievably fantastic young people,

1:55:49.140 --> 1:55:51.580
 you know, who are sort of like you say,

1:55:51.580 --> 1:55:54.260
 they're dreamers and they're problem solvers

1:55:54.260 --> 1:56:01.260
 and they're, I mean, they have enormously humane values

1:56:01.420 --> 1:56:02.980
 and ways of thinking about the world

1:56:02.980 --> 1:56:05.740
 and they wanna do good.

1:56:05.740 --> 1:56:07.460
 You know, if you take the kind of,

1:56:08.460 --> 1:56:11.900
 I mean, this has probably been true all the way along,

1:56:11.900 --> 1:56:14.820
 but I mean, the percentage of do gooders,

1:56:14.820 --> 1:56:16.740
 you know, is really enormously large.

1:56:16.740 --> 1:56:18.100
 Now, whether they end up working

1:56:18.100 --> 1:56:20.740
 for some kind of shark law firm or something,

1:56:20.740 --> 1:56:24.900
 you know, or, you know, that kind of thing,

1:56:24.900 --> 1:56:26.780
 or whether they end up human rights lawyers

1:56:26.780 --> 1:56:28.380
 is they all wanna be, right?

1:56:28.380 --> 1:56:33.380
 You know, is a different kind of question,

1:56:33.700 --> 1:56:38.180
 but certainly, you know, these young people are talented,

1:56:38.180 --> 1:56:41.100
 they're smart, they have wonderful values,

1:56:41.100 --> 1:56:44.100
 they're energetic, they work hard, you know,

1:56:44.100 --> 1:56:48.860
 they're focused and of course, it's not just Stanford.

1:56:48.860 --> 1:56:50.300
 I mean, it's all over the country,

1:56:50.300 --> 1:56:52.540
 you know, you have young people

1:56:52.540 --> 1:56:55.940
 who really wanna contribute and they wanna contribute.

1:56:55.940 --> 1:56:58.900
 I mean, it's true some of them end up,

1:56:58.900 --> 1:57:02.100
 you know, working to get rich.

1:57:02.100 --> 1:57:03.700
 I mean, that's inevitable, right?

1:57:03.700 --> 1:57:07.460
 But the percentages are actually rather small,

1:57:07.460 --> 1:57:08.780
 at least at this age, you know,

1:57:08.780 --> 1:57:10.660
 maybe when they get a mortgage and a family

1:57:10.660 --> 1:57:12.780
 and that sort of thing, you know,

1:57:13.820 --> 1:57:16.260
 financial wellbeing will be more important to them.

1:57:16.260 --> 1:57:19.980
 But right now, you know, you catch this young generation

1:57:19.980 --> 1:57:22.060
 and they're fantastic, they're fantastic.

1:57:22.060 --> 1:57:26.220
 And they're not what they're often portrayed as being,

1:57:26.220 --> 1:57:30.980
 you know, kind of silly and naive and knee jerk leftists

1:57:30.980 --> 1:57:33.620
 and that, they're not at all like that.

1:57:33.620 --> 1:57:36.700
 You know, they're really fine young people.

1:57:36.700 --> 1:57:40.380
 So that's a source of optimism to me too.

1:57:40.380 --> 1:57:43.980
 What advice would you give to those young people today,

1:57:43.980 --> 1:57:47.100
 maybe in high school, in college, at Stanford,

1:57:47.100 --> 1:57:52.100
 maybe to your grandchildren about how to have a career

1:57:52.380 --> 1:57:55.500
 they can be proud of, have a life they can be proud of?

1:57:55.500 --> 1:57:58.540
 Pursue careers that are in the public interest,

1:57:58.540 --> 1:58:00.020
 you know, in one fashion or another

1:58:00.020 --> 1:58:02.340
 and not just in their interests.

1:58:03.900 --> 1:58:07.100
 And that would be, I mean, it's not bad to pursue a career

1:58:07.100 --> 1:58:08.020
 in your own interests.

1:58:08.020 --> 1:58:11.060
 I mean, as long as it's something that's useful

1:58:11.060 --> 1:58:16.060
 and positive for their families or whatever.

1:58:16.060 --> 1:58:19.860
 But yeah, so I mean, I try to advise kids

1:58:19.860 --> 1:58:24.380
 to find themselves somehow, you know, find who they wanna be

1:58:24.380 --> 1:58:27.100
 and what they wanna be and try to pursue it.

1:58:27.100 --> 1:58:30.140
 And the NGO world is growing, as you know,

1:58:30.140 --> 1:58:34.420
 and a lot of young people are kind of throwing themselves

1:58:34.420 --> 1:58:39.420
 into it and, you know, human rights watch

1:58:39.820 --> 1:58:41.020
 and that kind of stuff.

1:58:41.020 --> 1:58:43.340
 And, you know, they wanna do that kind of work

1:58:43.340 --> 1:58:46.940
 and it's very admirable.

1:58:46.940 --> 1:58:50.700
 I tend to think that even if you're not working

1:58:50.700 --> 1:58:53.580
 in human rights, there's a certain way in which

1:58:53.580 --> 1:58:58.580
 if you live with integrity, I believe that all of us

1:59:01.300 --> 1:59:05.860
 or many of us have a bunch of moments in our lives

1:59:05.860 --> 1:59:07.980
 when we're posed with a decision.

1:59:07.980 --> 1:59:09.300
 It's a quiet one.

1:59:09.300 --> 1:59:12.340
 Maybe it'll never be written about or talked about.

1:59:12.340 --> 1:59:17.340
 But you get to choose whether you, there's a choice

1:59:17.340 --> 1:59:22.340
 that is difficult to make, it may require sacrifice,

1:59:22.580 --> 1:59:27.140
 but it's the choice that the best version

1:59:27.140 --> 1:59:28.780
 of that person would make.

1:59:29.860 --> 1:59:31.420
 That's the best way I can sort of say

1:59:31.420 --> 1:59:32.540
 how to act with integrity.

1:59:32.540 --> 1:59:35.260
 It's the very thing that would resist the early days

1:59:35.260 --> 1:59:36.180
 in Nazi Germany.

1:59:36.180 --> 1:59:40.260
 It sounds dramatic to say, but those little actions.

1:59:40.260 --> 1:59:43.940
 And I feel like the best you can do

1:59:43.940 --> 1:59:47.940
 to avoid genocide on scale is for all of us

1:59:47.940 --> 1:59:51.860
 to live in that way, within those moments,

1:59:51.860 --> 1:59:55.460
 unrelated potentially to human rights, to anything else,

1:59:55.460 --> 1:59:57.420
 is to take those actions.

1:59:57.420 --> 2:00:00.420
 Like I believe that all of us know the right thing to do.

2:00:00.420 --> 2:00:01.500
 I know that's right.

2:00:01.500 --> 2:00:02.700
 I think that's right.

2:00:02.700 --> 2:00:04.020
 You put it very well.

2:00:04.020 --> 2:00:06.660
 I couldn't have done it better myself.

2:00:06.660 --> 2:00:07.940
 No, no, I agree.

2:00:07.940 --> 2:00:12.940
 I agree completely that there are, to live with truth,

2:00:13.980 --> 2:00:17.300
 which is what Václav Havel used to say,

2:00:17.300 --> 2:00:21.100
 this famous Czech dissident talked about living in truth,

2:00:21.100 --> 2:00:23.100
 but also to live with integrity.

2:00:24.980 --> 2:00:26.860
 And that's really super important.

2:00:27.780 --> 2:00:29.140
 Well, let me ask you about love.

2:00:29.140 --> 2:00:31.300
 What role does love play in this whole thing

2:00:31.300 --> 2:00:33.260
 in the human condition?

2:00:33.260 --> 2:00:35.340
 In all of the study of genocide,

2:00:35.340 --> 2:00:39.220
 it does seem that hardship in moments

2:00:39.220 --> 2:00:41.260
 brings out the best in human nature

2:00:41.260 --> 2:00:44.340
 and the best in human nature is expressed through love.

2:00:44.340 --> 2:00:46.180
 Well, as I already mentioned to you,

2:00:46.180 --> 2:00:51.180
 I think hardship is not a good thing for,

2:00:52.380 --> 2:00:53.980
 you know, it's not the best thing for love.

2:00:53.980 --> 2:00:57.700
 I mean, it's better to not have to suffer

2:00:57.700 --> 2:01:00.940
 and not have to, yes, I think it is.

2:01:00.940 --> 2:01:05.700
 I think it's, you know, as I mentioned to you,

2:01:05.700 --> 2:01:08.340
 you know, studying concentration camps,

2:01:08.340 --> 2:01:10.460
 you know, this is not a place for love.

2:01:10.460 --> 2:01:13.780
 It happens, it happens,

2:01:13.780 --> 2:01:15.260
 but it's not really a place for love.

2:01:15.260 --> 2:01:16.660
 It's a place for rape.

2:01:16.660 --> 2:01:19.380
 It's a place for torture.

2:01:19.380 --> 2:01:20.460
 It's a place for killing.

2:01:20.460 --> 2:01:25.460
 And it's a place for inhuman action one to another,

2:01:25.500 --> 2:01:27.860
 you know, and also, as I said,

2:01:27.860 --> 2:01:30.500
 among those who are suffering,

2:01:30.500 --> 2:01:33.140
 not just between those who are,

2:01:33.140 --> 2:01:34.820
 and then there are whole gradations,

2:01:34.820 --> 2:01:36.340
 you know, the same thing in the gulag.

2:01:36.340 --> 2:01:38.260
 You know, there are gradations all the way

2:01:38.260 --> 2:01:41.020
 from the criminal prisoners

2:01:41.020 --> 2:01:42.940
 who beat the hell out of the political prisoners,

2:01:42.940 --> 2:01:44.900
 you know, who then have others below them

2:01:44.900 --> 2:01:46.020
 who they beat down, you know,

2:01:46.020 --> 2:01:48.460
 so everybody's being the hell out of everybody else.

2:01:48.460 --> 2:01:53.380
 So I would not idealize in any way suffering as,

2:01:53.380 --> 2:01:57.260
 you know, a source of beauty and love.

2:01:57.260 --> 2:01:58.100
 I wouldn't do that at all.

2:01:58.100 --> 2:02:00.700
 I think it's a whole lot better

2:02:00.700 --> 2:02:03.220
 for people to be relatively prosperous.

2:02:03.220 --> 2:02:04.820
 I'm not saying super prosperous,

2:02:04.820 --> 2:02:06.380
 but to be able to feed themselves

2:02:06.380 --> 2:02:08.260
 and to be able to feed their families

2:02:08.260 --> 2:02:13.140
 and house their families and take care of themselves,

2:02:14.820 --> 2:02:19.820
 you know, to foster loving relations between people.

2:02:21.140 --> 2:02:24.980
 And, you know, I think it's no accident

2:02:24.980 --> 2:02:29.980
 that, you know, poor families have much worse records

2:02:31.940 --> 2:02:34.580
 when it comes to crime and things like that, you know,

2:02:34.580 --> 2:02:39.580
 and also to wife beating and to child abuse

2:02:39.820 --> 2:02:40.820
 and stuff like that.

2:02:40.820 --> 2:02:45.820
 I mean, you just, you don't want to be poor and indigent

2:02:46.580 --> 2:02:49.420
 and not have a roof over your head, be homeless.

2:02:49.420 --> 2:02:51.420
 I mean, it doesn't mean, again, you know,

2:02:51.420 --> 2:02:53.300
 homeless people are mean people.

2:02:53.300 --> 2:02:54.580
 That's not what I'm trying to say.

2:02:54.580 --> 2:02:56.940
 What I'm trying to say is that, you know,

2:02:56.940 --> 2:02:59.060
 what we want to try to foster in this country

2:02:59.060 --> 2:03:02.380
 and around the world, and one of the reasons, you know,

2:03:03.660 --> 2:03:07.180
 I mean, I'm very critical of the Chinese in a lot of ways,

2:03:07.180 --> 2:03:09.260
 but I mean, we have to remember they pulled that country

2:03:09.260 --> 2:03:11.100
 out of horrible poverty, right?

2:03:11.100 --> 2:03:14.540
 And I mean, there's still poor people in the countryside.

2:03:14.540 --> 2:03:16.620
 There's still problems, you know,

2:03:16.620 --> 2:03:21.620
 with want and need among the Chinese people.

2:03:21.620 --> 2:03:24.380
 But, you know, there were millions and millions of Chinese

2:03:24.380 --> 2:03:26.540
 who were living at the bare minimum of life,

2:03:26.540 --> 2:03:28.260
 which is no way to live, you know,

2:03:28.260 --> 2:03:31.300
 and no way, again, to foster love and compassion

2:03:31.300 --> 2:03:33.820
 and getting along.

2:03:33.820 --> 2:03:37.740
 So I want to be clear, I don't speak for history, right?

2:03:37.740 --> 2:03:41.140
 I'm giving you, there used to be historians,

2:03:41.140 --> 2:03:43.000
 you know, in the 19th century who really thought

2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:45.500
 they were speaking for history, you know?

2:03:45.500 --> 2:03:47.020
 I don't think that way at all.

2:03:47.020 --> 2:03:49.540
 I mean, I understand I'm a subjective human being

2:03:49.540 --> 2:03:54.020
 with my own points of view and my own opinions, but.

2:03:54.020 --> 2:03:56.120
 I'm trying to remember this in this conversation

2:03:56.120 --> 2:03:58.900
 that you're, despite the fact that you're brilliant

2:03:58.900 --> 2:04:00.640
 and you've written brilliant books,

2:04:00.640 --> 2:04:04.300
 that you're just human with an opinion.

2:04:04.300 --> 2:04:07.060
 That's it, yeah, no, no, that's absolutely true.

2:04:07.060 --> 2:04:09.660
 And I tell my students that too.

2:04:09.660 --> 2:04:11.240
 I mean, I make sure they understand

2:04:11.240 --> 2:04:12.940
 this is not history speaking, you know,

2:04:12.940 --> 2:04:15.780
 this is me and Norman and I'm, you know,

2:04:15.780 --> 2:04:18.420
 and this is what it's about.

2:04:18.420 --> 2:04:21.100
 I mean, I spent a long time studying history

2:04:21.100 --> 2:04:24.940
 and have enjoyed it enormously.

2:04:24.940 --> 2:04:29.460
 But, you know, I'm an individual with my points of view.

2:04:29.460 --> 2:04:33.140
 And one of them is that I've developed over time,

2:04:34.100 --> 2:04:39.100
 is that, you know, human want is a real tragedy for people

2:04:40.180 --> 2:04:44.260
 and it hurts people and it also causes upheavals

2:04:44.260 --> 2:04:45.720
 and difficulties and stuff.

2:04:46.720 --> 2:04:49.500
 So I feel for people, you know, I feel for people in Syria,

2:04:49.500 --> 2:04:54.500
 I feel for people in, you know, in Ethiopia, in Tigray,

2:04:54.580 --> 2:04:56.260
 you know, when they don't have enough to eat.

2:04:56.260 --> 2:04:58.500
 And, you know, what that does, I mean,

2:04:58.500 --> 2:05:00.540
 it doesn't mean they don't love each other, right?

2:05:00.540 --> 2:05:03.020
 And it doesn't mean they don't love their kids.

2:05:03.020 --> 2:05:06.620
 But it does mean that it's harder, you know, to do that.

2:05:06.620 --> 2:05:08.420
 And to, and...

2:05:08.420 --> 2:05:11.220
 I'm not so sure, it's obvious to me that it's harder.

2:05:11.220 --> 2:05:13.260
 It's, there's suffering, there is suffering.

2:05:13.260 --> 2:05:16.580
 But the numbers, we've been talking about deaths,

2:05:16.580 --> 2:05:17.820
 we've been talking about suffering,

2:05:17.820 --> 2:05:19.980
 but the numbers we're not quantifying.

2:05:19.980 --> 2:05:22.740
 The history that you haven't perhaps been looking at

2:05:22.740 --> 2:05:24.660
 is all the times that people have fallen in love,

2:05:24.660 --> 2:05:27.940
 deeply with friends, with romantic love,

2:05:27.940 --> 2:05:31.460
 the positive emotion that people have felt.

2:05:31.460 --> 2:05:34.320
 And I'm not so sure that amidst the suffering,

2:05:34.320 --> 2:05:36.700
 those moments of beauty and love can be discovered.

2:05:36.700 --> 2:05:38.340
 And if we look at the numbers,

2:05:38.340 --> 2:05:41.020
 I'm not so sure the story is obvious.

2:05:41.020 --> 2:05:43.700
 That, you know, I mean, again,

2:05:43.700 --> 2:05:46.860
 I suppose you may disagree with Viktor Frankl.

2:05:46.860 --> 2:05:49.540
 I may too, maybe depending on the day.

2:05:49.540 --> 2:05:52.540
 I mean, he says that if there's meaning to this life at all,

2:05:52.540 --> 2:05:53.940
 there's meaning to the suffering too,

2:05:53.940 --> 2:05:56.220
 because suffering is part of life.

2:05:56.220 --> 2:06:01.220
 There's something about accepting the ups and downs,

2:06:01.660 --> 2:06:03.820
 even when the downs go very low.

2:06:03.820 --> 2:06:07.780
 And within all of it, finding a source of meaning.

2:06:07.780 --> 2:06:09.880
 I mean, he's arguing from the perspective of psychology,

2:06:09.880 --> 2:06:13.420
 but just this life is an incredible gift,

2:06:13.420 --> 2:06:15.420
 almost no matter what.

2:06:15.420 --> 2:06:20.420
 And I'm not, it's easy to look at suffering

2:06:20.660 --> 2:06:22.780
 and think if we just escape the suffering,

2:06:22.780 --> 2:06:27.400
 it will all be better, but we all die.

2:06:28.620 --> 2:06:30.380
 There's beauty in the whole thing.

2:06:30.380 --> 2:06:34.020
 And it is true that it's just,

2:06:34.020 --> 2:06:35.340
 from all the stories I've read,

2:06:35.340 --> 2:06:39.360
 especially in famine and starvation, it's just horrible.

2:06:39.360 --> 2:06:41.280
 It is horrible suffering.

2:06:41.280 --> 2:06:45.940
 But I also just want to say that there's love amidst it,

2:06:45.940 --> 2:06:47.300
 and we can't forget that.

2:06:47.300 --> 2:06:50.300
 No, no, I don't forget it, I don't forget it.

2:06:50.300 --> 2:06:52.860
 And I think it's from the stories.

2:06:52.860 --> 2:06:56.760
 Now, I don't want to make that compromise or that trade,

2:06:56.760 --> 2:06:59.580
 but the intensity of friendship in war,

2:06:59.580 --> 2:07:04.520
 the intensity of love in war is very high.

2:07:04.520 --> 2:07:07.220
 So I'm not sure what to make of these calculations,

2:07:07.220 --> 2:07:08.820
 but if you look at the stories,

2:07:08.820 --> 2:07:10.580
 some of the people I'm closest with,

2:07:10.580 --> 2:07:12.300
 and I've never experienced anything

2:07:12.300 --> 2:07:14.260
 even close to any of this,

2:07:14.260 --> 2:07:15.740
 but some of the people I'm closest with

2:07:15.740 --> 2:07:18.280
 is people I've gone through difficult times with.

2:07:18.280 --> 2:07:20.020
 There's something about that.

2:07:20.020 --> 2:07:24.860
 They're a society or a group where things are easy.

2:07:24.860 --> 2:07:27.580
 The intensity of the connection between human beings

2:07:27.580 --> 2:07:29.020
 is not as strong.

2:07:29.020 --> 2:07:31.420
 I don't know what to do with that calculus

2:07:31.420 --> 2:07:32.740
 because I too agree with you.

2:07:32.740 --> 2:07:37.540
 I want to have as little suffering in the world as possible,

2:07:37.540 --> 2:07:39.360
 but we have to remember about the love

2:07:39.360 --> 2:07:40.980
 and the depth of human connection

2:07:40.980 --> 2:07:42.900
 and find the right balance there.

2:07:44.800 --> 2:07:46.800
 No, there's something to what you're saying.

2:07:46.800 --> 2:07:48.460
 There's clearly something to what you're saying.

2:07:48.460 --> 2:07:50.700
 I was just thinking about the Soviet Union

2:07:50.700 --> 2:07:53.440
 when I lived there and people on the streets

2:07:53.440 --> 2:07:56.740
 were so mean to one another and they never smiled.

2:07:56.740 --> 2:07:57.580
 You grew up there?

2:07:57.580 --> 2:07:58.900
 No, but you were, you're too young to.

2:07:58.900 --> 2:08:00.500
 No, no, I remember well.

2:08:00.500 --> 2:08:01.820
 I came here when I was 13, yeah.

2:08:01.820 --> 2:08:04.660
 Okay, so anyway, I remember living there

2:08:04.660 --> 2:08:07.100
 and just how hard people were on each other on the streets.

2:08:07.100 --> 2:08:09.020
 And when you got inside people's apartments,

2:08:09.020 --> 2:08:11.260
 when they started to trust you,

2:08:11.260 --> 2:08:14.120
 the friendships were so intense and so wonderful.

2:08:15.080 --> 2:08:19.700
 So in that sense, I mean, they did live a hard life,

2:08:19.700 --> 2:08:21.460
 but there wasn't a food on the table

2:08:21.460 --> 2:08:23.060
 and there was a roof over their heads.

2:08:23.060 --> 2:08:24.040
 There's a certain line.

2:08:24.040 --> 2:08:25.980
 There's a certain, there are lines.

2:08:25.980 --> 2:08:27.200
 I don't think there's one line,

2:08:27.200 --> 2:08:29.940
 but it's kind of a shading.

2:08:29.940 --> 2:08:32.100
 And the other story I was thinking of as you were talking

2:08:32.100 --> 2:08:36.460
 was not a story, it's a history,

2:08:36.460 --> 2:08:38.460
 a book by a friend of mine

2:08:38.460 --> 2:08:43.460
 who wrote about love in the camps,

2:08:43.940 --> 2:08:48.260
 in the refugee camps for Jews in Germany after the war.

2:08:48.260 --> 2:08:51.300
 So these were Jews who had come mostly from Poland

2:08:51.300 --> 2:08:54.100
 and some survived the camps,

2:08:54.100 --> 2:08:56.180
 came from awful circumstances.

2:08:56.180 --> 2:08:58.820
 And then they were put in these camps,

2:08:58.820 --> 2:09:00.840
 which were not joyful places.

2:09:00.840 --> 2:09:03.100
 I mean, they were guarded sometimes by Germans even,

2:09:03.100 --> 2:09:06.260
 but they're basically under the British control

2:09:06.260 --> 2:09:08.100
 and they were trying to get to Israel,

2:09:08.100 --> 2:09:11.940
 trying to get to Palestine right after the war.

2:09:11.940 --> 2:09:16.060
 And how many pairs there were, how many people coupled up.

2:09:16.060 --> 2:09:18.660
 But remember, this is after being in the concentration camp.

2:09:18.660 --> 2:09:20.580
 It's not being in the concentration camp.

2:09:20.580 --> 2:09:25.580
 And it's also being free to, more or less free,

2:09:26.780 --> 2:09:30.860
 to express their emotions and to be human beings

2:09:30.860 --> 2:09:34.360
 after this horrible thing which they suffered.

2:09:34.360 --> 2:09:36.880
 So I wonder whether there's, as you say,

2:09:36.880 --> 2:09:41.560
 some kind of calculus there where the level of suffering

2:09:41.560 --> 2:09:46.560
 is such that it's just too much for humans to bear.

2:09:47.180 --> 2:09:51.100
 And which I would suggest,

2:09:51.100 --> 2:09:52.620
 I mean, I haven't studied this myself.

2:09:52.620 --> 2:09:54.700
 I'm just giving you my point of view,

2:09:54.700 --> 2:09:57.480
 my off the cuff remarks here.

2:09:57.480 --> 2:10:00.020
 But it was very inspiring to read about these couples

2:10:00.020 --> 2:10:01.840
 who had met right in these camps

2:10:01.840 --> 2:10:06.020
 and started to couple up and get married.

2:10:06.020 --> 2:10:09.420
 And tried to find their way to Palestine,

2:10:09.420 --> 2:10:11.540
 which was a difficult thing to do then.

2:10:11.540 --> 2:10:14.460
 When did you live in Russia and the Soviet Union?

2:10:14.460 --> 2:10:16.100
 What's your memory of the time?

2:10:16.100 --> 2:10:18.460
 Well, so a number of different times.

2:10:18.460 --> 2:10:22.220
 So I went there, I first went there in 69, 70.

2:10:22.220 --> 2:10:23.740
 Wow. A long time ago.

2:10:23.740 --> 2:10:28.740
 And then I lived in Leningrad mostly,

2:10:28.740 --> 2:10:31.620
 but also in Moscow in 1975.

2:10:31.620 --> 2:10:33.700
 So it was detente time.

2:10:33.700 --> 2:10:38.700
 But it was also a time of political uncertainty

2:10:39.500 --> 2:10:44.500
 and also hardship for Russians themselves,

2:10:44.780 --> 2:10:46.060
 standing in long lines.

2:10:46.060 --> 2:10:47.980
 I mean, you must remember this for food

2:10:47.980 --> 2:10:51.780
 and for getting anything was almost impossible.

2:10:51.780 --> 2:10:55.420
 It was a time when Jews were trying to get out.

2:10:56.820 --> 2:10:59.880
 In fact, I just talked to a friend of mine from those days

2:10:59.880 --> 2:11:01.740
 who I helped get out and get to Boston

2:11:01.740 --> 2:11:05.380
 and the lovely people who had managed to have a good life

2:11:06.260 --> 2:11:08.780
 in the United States after they left.

2:11:08.780 --> 2:11:10.020
 But it wasn't an easy time.

2:11:10.020 --> 2:11:11.740
 It wasn't an easy time at all.

2:11:11.740 --> 2:11:13.940
 I remember people set fire to their doors

2:11:13.940 --> 2:11:18.340
 and their daughter was persecuted in school

2:11:18.340 --> 2:11:21.460
 once they declared that they wanted to immigrate

2:11:21.460 --> 2:11:22.380
 and that sort of thing.

2:11:22.380 --> 2:11:25.280
 So it was a very, it was a lot of antisemitism.

2:11:27.420 --> 2:11:28.580
 So it was a tough time.

2:11:28.580 --> 2:11:32.340
 Dissidents hung out with some dissidents

2:11:32.340 --> 2:11:34.220
 and one guy was actually killed.

2:11:35.620 --> 2:11:38.560
 We think by the, nobody knows exactly by the KGB,

2:11:38.560 --> 2:11:40.900
 but his art studio was,

2:11:40.900 --> 2:11:43.500
 he had a separate studio in Leningrad,

2:11:43.500 --> 2:11:48.500
 St. Petersburg today, just a small studio

2:11:48.620 --> 2:11:51.380
 where he did his art and somebody set it on fire.

2:11:51.380 --> 2:11:54.380
 And we think it was KGB, but you never really know.

2:11:56.380 --> 2:11:57.900
 And he died in that fire.

2:11:57.900 --> 2:12:01.460
 So it was not, it was a tough time.

2:12:01.460 --> 2:12:04.660
 And you knew you were followed,

2:12:04.660 --> 2:12:06.540
 you knew you were being reported on

2:12:06.540 --> 2:12:08.860
 as a foreign scholar as I was.

2:12:08.860 --> 2:12:12.360
 There was a formal exchange between the United States

2:12:12.360 --> 2:12:16.620
 and the Soviet Union and they let me work in the archives,

2:12:16.620 --> 2:12:21.620
 but then Ivanov got to work in the physics lab

2:12:22.300 --> 2:12:24.460
 at Rochester or something like that.

2:12:24.460 --> 2:12:29.220
 So it was an exchange which sent historians

2:12:29.220 --> 2:12:33.620
 and literary people and some social scientists to Russia

2:12:33.620 --> 2:12:36.660
 and they sent all scientists here to grab what they could

2:12:36.660 --> 2:12:38.420
 from MIT and those places.

2:12:39.380 --> 2:12:40.620
 How's your Russian?

2:12:41.860 --> 2:12:44.560
 Do you have any knowledge of Russian language

2:12:44.560 --> 2:12:46.300
 that has helped you to understand?

2:12:46.300 --> 2:12:47.500
 Oh yeah, yeah.

2:12:47.500 --> 2:12:50.180
 I mean, I can read it fine.

2:12:50.180 --> 2:12:52.940
 And the speaking comes and goes,

2:12:52.940 --> 2:12:55.900
 depending on whether I'm there or I've been there recently

2:12:55.900 --> 2:12:57.500
 or if I spend some time there,

2:12:57.500 --> 2:12:58.660
 because I really need, you know,

2:12:58.660 --> 2:13:00.460
 I have Russian friends who speak just Russian.

2:13:00.460 --> 2:13:04.340
 So, you know, when I'm there, I then, you know,

2:13:04.340 --> 2:13:05.780
 I can communicate pretty well.

2:13:05.780 --> 2:13:08.120
 Well, I can't really write it unfortunately.

2:13:08.120 --> 2:13:11.900
 I mean, I can, but it's not very good,

2:13:11.900 --> 2:13:13.980
 but I get along fine in Russia.

2:13:13.980 --> 2:13:17.980
 What's your fondest memory of the Soviet Union, of Russia?

2:13:17.980 --> 2:13:18.820
 It's friends.

2:13:18.820 --> 2:13:19.660
 Friends?

2:13:19.660 --> 2:13:20.940
 It's friends, it's friends.

2:13:20.940 --> 2:13:25.180
 Was it vodka involved or is it just vodka involved?

2:13:25.180 --> 2:13:27.420
 Little bit, you know, I'm not much of a drinker.

2:13:27.420 --> 2:13:29.580
 So I would, you know, they'd just make fun of me

2:13:29.580 --> 2:13:32.980
 and I'd make fun of myself and that was easy enough.

2:13:32.980 --> 2:13:35.720
 I don't really like, you know, a heavy drink.

2:13:35.720 --> 2:13:37.860
 I've done a lot of that, not a lot.

2:13:37.860 --> 2:13:40.180
 I'd done some of that, but I never really enjoyed it

2:13:40.180 --> 2:13:42.580
 and would get sick and stuff.

2:13:42.580 --> 2:13:45.340
 But no, it's friends.

2:13:45.340 --> 2:13:49.540
 You know, one friend I made in the dormitory, you know,

2:13:49.540 --> 2:13:51.460
 it was a dormitory for foreigners,

2:13:51.460 --> 2:13:56.220
 but also Siberians who had come, you know,

2:13:56.220 --> 2:13:58.740
 to Leningrad to study.

2:13:58.740 --> 2:14:00.380
 And so I met a couple of guys

2:14:00.380 --> 2:14:04.580
 and one in particular from Omsk became a wonderful friend.

2:14:04.580 --> 2:14:06.940
 And we talked and talked and talked outside.

2:14:06.940 --> 2:14:08.300
 You know, we would go walk outside

2:14:08.300 --> 2:14:10.500
 because we both knew they were, you know,

2:14:10.500 --> 2:14:12.060
 people were listening and stuff.

2:14:12.060 --> 2:14:15.020
 And he would say, well, this is, he was an historian,

2:14:15.020 --> 2:14:16.700
 you know, and so we would talk history.

2:14:16.700 --> 2:14:18.580
 And he'd say, well, this was the case, wasn't it?

2:14:18.580 --> 2:14:21.100
 I said, no, I'm sorry, Sasha, it wasn't the case.

2:14:21.100 --> 2:14:23.180
 It was, you know,

2:14:23.180 --> 2:14:26.460
 we think Stalin actually had a role in killing Kirov.

2:14:26.460 --> 2:14:28.980
 I mean, we're not sure, but he said, no.

2:14:28.980 --> 2:14:29.900
 I said, yeah.

2:14:29.900 --> 2:14:32.100
 You know, so, you know, we had these conversations

2:14:32.100 --> 2:14:36.580
 and he was, what I would,

2:14:36.580 --> 2:14:38.260
 I don't know if he would agree with me or not.

2:14:38.260 --> 2:14:39.220
 I mean, we're still friends.

2:14:39.220 --> 2:14:43.980
 So he was a naive, maybe he'll listen to the blog

2:14:43.980 --> 2:14:45.260
 or I'll send it to him or something.

2:14:45.260 --> 2:14:48.180
 He was a kind of naive Marxist, Leninist.

2:14:48.180 --> 2:14:51.260
 And he thought I was, you know, I was, you know,

2:14:51.260 --> 2:14:52.780
 I had this capitalist ideology.

2:14:52.780 --> 2:14:54.260
 He'd say, what ideology you have?

2:14:54.260 --> 2:14:56.380
 And I said, I don't have an ideology.

2:14:56.380 --> 2:14:59.980
 You know, I try to just put together kind of reason

2:14:59.980 --> 2:15:02.620
 and facts and accurate stories

2:15:02.620 --> 2:15:03.860
 and try to tell them in that way.

2:15:03.860 --> 2:15:06.700
 No, no, no, no, you must, you know, you're a bourgeois,

2:15:06.700 --> 2:15:07.540
 you know, this or that.

2:15:07.540 --> 2:15:09.140
 I said, no, I'm really not.

2:15:09.140 --> 2:15:11.940
 And so we would have these talks

2:15:11.940 --> 2:15:13.140
 and these kinds of arguments.

2:15:13.140 --> 2:15:16.740
 And then, I mean, sure enough, you know,

2:15:16.740 --> 2:15:19.220
 we corresponded for a while

2:15:19.220 --> 2:15:20.940
 and then he had to stop corresponding

2:15:20.940 --> 2:15:25.620
 because he became a kind of local official in Omsk.

2:15:25.620 --> 2:15:29.540
 And he sort of migrated more and more to being a Democrat.

2:15:29.540 --> 2:15:31.620
 And he was then in the, you know,

2:15:31.620 --> 2:15:34.900
 democratic movement under Gorbachev

2:15:34.900 --> 2:15:38.500
 and, you know, in the council of people's deputies,

2:15:38.500 --> 2:15:40.580
 which they set up, which was, you know,

2:15:41.660 --> 2:15:45.180
 elected as a Democrat from Omsk

2:15:45.180 --> 2:15:49.460
 and had a political career through the Yeltsin period.

2:15:49.460 --> 2:15:52.780
 And once Putin came along, you know, it was over.

2:15:53.980 --> 2:15:56.180
 He didn't like Putin and, you know,

2:15:56.180 --> 2:15:59.140
 and Putin didn't like the Yeltsin people, right?

2:15:59.140 --> 2:16:02.620
 Who were, tried to be, some of them tried to be Democrats.

2:16:02.620 --> 2:16:04.180
 And Sasha was one who really did.

2:16:04.180 --> 2:16:06.580
 He just published his memoirs in Russian, by the way,

2:16:06.580 --> 2:16:08.020
 which are very good, I think.

2:16:08.020 --> 2:16:11.220
 I think I've been hearing it.

2:16:11.220 --> 2:16:15.660
 Komanderovkifovlast, that's what it's called.

2:16:15.660 --> 2:16:19.460
 It's hard to translate in English, Komanderovkifovlast.

2:16:19.460 --> 2:16:22.020
 But I mean, I translated it full points once for him.

2:16:22.020 --> 2:16:23.060
 This is so beautiful.

2:16:23.060 --> 2:16:26.540
 Like the, do you find that the translation is a problem

2:16:26.540 --> 2:16:27.380
 or no?

2:16:27.380 --> 2:16:28.380
 It's such a different language.

2:16:28.380 --> 2:16:30.140
 Yes, translation is very difficult.

2:16:30.140 --> 2:16:31.300
 With the Russian language, I mean,

2:16:31.300 --> 2:16:35.660
 it's the only language I know deeply except English.

2:16:35.660 --> 2:16:38.780
 And it seems like so much is lost of the pain,

2:16:38.780 --> 2:16:40.700
 the poetry, the beauty of the people.

2:16:40.700 --> 2:16:44.380
 And translators are to be treasured and good ones,

2:16:44.380 --> 2:16:47.780
 to be, I mean, those who do the translations,

2:16:47.780 --> 2:16:50.620
 when you read things in translation,

2:16:50.620 --> 2:16:52.100
 sometimes they're quite beautiful,

2:16:52.100 --> 2:16:55.380
 whether it's Russian or Polish or German or anything French.

2:16:55.380 --> 2:16:57.500
 Yeah, I'm actually traveling to Paris

2:16:57.500 --> 2:17:01.260
 to talk to the famous translators that Dostoevsky told story.

2:17:02.620 --> 2:17:04.580
 And I'm just gonna do a several conversations with them

2:17:04.580 --> 2:17:06.860
 about like, you could just sometimes just grab

2:17:06.860 --> 2:17:09.380
 a single sentence and just talk about the translation

2:17:09.380 --> 2:17:14.380
 in that sense, that's, and also, as you said,

2:17:14.820 --> 2:17:16.180
 I would love to be a fly on the wall

2:17:16.180 --> 2:17:17.580
 with some of those friends that you had

2:17:17.580 --> 2:17:21.700
 because the perspective on history, nonacademic,

2:17:21.700 --> 2:17:26.060
 sort of without just as human beings is so different

2:17:26.060 --> 2:17:28.380
 from the United States versus Russia.

2:17:28.380 --> 2:17:30.660
 When you talk about the way the World War II is perceived

2:17:30.660 --> 2:17:35.260
 and all those kinds of things, it's fascinating.

2:17:35.260 --> 2:17:39.500
 History also has, in it, opinion and perspective.

2:17:39.500 --> 2:17:41.820
 And so sometimes stripping that away is really difficult.

2:17:41.820 --> 2:17:44.980
 And then I guess that is your job and at its highest form,

2:17:44.980 --> 2:17:47.500
 that is what you do as a historian.

2:17:47.500 --> 2:17:48.860
 Well, Norman,

2:17:48.860 --> 2:17:52.700
 Spasibo bashoi shto sivonya samaya katorini.

2:17:52.700 --> 2:17:54.500
 I really appreciate your valuable time.

2:17:54.500 --> 2:17:55.980
 It's truly an honor to talk to you

2:17:55.980 --> 2:18:00.260
 and thank you for taking us through a trip,

2:18:00.260 --> 2:18:02.740
 through some of the worst parts of human history

2:18:02.740 --> 2:18:06.340
 and talking about hope and love at the end.

2:18:06.340 --> 2:18:08.020
 So I really appreciate your time today.

2:18:08.020 --> 2:18:08.860
 Okay, thank you.

2:18:08.860 --> 2:18:09.700
 Thank you.

2:18:09.700 --> 2:18:11.300
 Thank you for having me.

2:18:11.300 --> 2:18:12.820
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:18:12.820 --> 2:18:14.220
 with Norman Namark.

2:18:14.220 --> 2:18:15.460

2:18:17.900 --> 2:18:21.180
 And now let me leave you with some words from Stalin.

2:18:21.180 --> 2:18:23.700
 A single death is a tragedy.

2:18:23.700 --> 2:18:26.220
 A million deaths is a statistic.

2:18:26.220 --> 2:18:32.220
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
