00:00.000 --> 00:02.700
 The following is a conversation with Mark Normand,

00:02.700 --> 00:05.320
 a New York comedian who has a way with words

00:05.320 --> 00:08.400
 that is often both dark and hilarious.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.400
 Let there be a warning, dear friends,

00:10.400 --> 00:13.540
 to proceed with caution and to wear protection.

00:13.540 --> 00:16.160
 You may, in fact, need it.

00:16.160 --> 00:19.360
 He has a special on his YouTube called Out to Lunch

00:19.360 --> 00:21.160
 and a new special on Netflix

00:21.160 --> 00:23.880
 as part of the standup season three series

00:23.880 --> 00:26.040
 I recommend you watch.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.160
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.320
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:30.320 --> 00:31.480
 in the description.

00:31.480 --> 00:35.400
 And now, here's my conversation with Mark Normand.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.480
 I asked Tim Dillon about Bukowski first,

00:38.480 --> 00:40.320
 so let me continue on that tradition

00:40.320 --> 00:42.160
 and ask you about something

00:42.160 --> 00:44.600
 that Charles Bukowski said about love.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.080
 Wait, are we rolling?

00:46.080 --> 00:47.160
 Yes. Oh, geez.

00:47.160 --> 00:48.440
 No hello, no nothing.

00:48.440 --> 00:50.040
 Nope. I thought I was robotic.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.840
 Bukowski said, love is a fog that burns away

00:54.840 --> 00:57.160
 with the first daylight of reality.

00:57.160 --> 01:00.520
 So Mark Normand, let me first ask you about love.

01:01.680 --> 01:02.860
 What are your thoughts about love?

01:02.860 --> 01:05.300
 You talk about your relationships quite a bit.

01:05.300 --> 01:07.640
 Do you think love can last?

01:07.640 --> 01:10.760
 I do, but I think it's work.

01:10.760 --> 01:13.520
 Everybody wants love to be this prepackaged,

01:13.520 --> 01:16.920
 perfect euphoric thing, but you gotta,

01:18.040 --> 01:20.160
 it's like a good body, you know?

01:20.160 --> 01:21.620
 We're all born with a good body,

01:21.620 --> 01:22.960
 but you gotta keep it in shape.

01:22.960 --> 01:25.840
 And it's the same with a loving relationship.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.360
 I think you.

01:27.360 --> 01:30.200
 Nobody wants to do the work, that's the problem.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.440
 You talked about, I think you told a story

01:32.440 --> 01:35.280
 about being unfaithful to a previous girlfriend

01:35.280 --> 01:36.680
 or something like that.

01:36.680 --> 01:41.360
 I think the story goes that you were like drifting apart.

01:41.360 --> 01:42.240
 Who were you talking to?

01:42.240 --> 01:44.120
 Burt Kreischer maybe or something like that?

01:44.120 --> 01:46.040
 Oh yeah, we were high school sweethearts,

01:46.040 --> 01:48.720
 dated for like 12 years and then.

01:48.720 --> 01:50.040
 So that wasn't love anymore.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.600
 That was more like relationship, that was like.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.320
 It was comfort, it was routine.

01:53.320 --> 01:57.960
 And we just slipped into that married life autopilot world.

01:57.960 --> 02:02.960
 And I tried to break up, I think, and it didn't take.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.400
 It was one of those things.

02:04.400 --> 02:07.480
 Our lives are just so baked in.

02:07.480 --> 02:10.680
 And then I think I cheated and she caught me

02:10.680 --> 02:11.640
 and it was ugly.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.620
 And then we went to therapy to try to work it out,

02:13.620 --> 02:16.440
 but it's much like a car that gets into a wreck.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.760
 The door just never closed the same.

02:18.760 --> 02:19.680
 You know what I mean?

02:19.680 --> 02:23.480
 Yeah, so what are your thoughts about then commitment

02:23.480 --> 02:25.720
 like outside of love marriage?

02:25.720 --> 02:27.480
 I think it's an antiquated idea.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.680
 I think it's kind of silly and unrealistic.

02:30.680 --> 02:31.880
 And I think we're coming out of that

02:31.880 --> 02:34.600
 as we get all polyamorous and non binary

02:34.600 --> 02:36.040
 and queefy and all this stuff.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.660
 I think we're slowly moving away from that.

02:38.660 --> 02:41.240
 But I think a lot of the ladies,

02:41.240 --> 02:45.400
 more majority women like marriage, like the idea of it.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.640
 Like I'm a fiance now or whatever you call it.

02:48.640 --> 02:49.840
 I'm engaged.

02:49.840 --> 02:54.600
 And I mean, she is just woo wee going hog wild.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.440
 She's loving it.

02:55.440 --> 02:57.720
 She's got the dress thing, pick a venue flower

02:57.720 --> 03:00.600
 and she's deep in whereas I feel guilty

03:00.600 --> 03:03.200
 because I'm just like, ah, geez.

03:04.600 --> 03:05.440
 Is it planned already?

03:05.440 --> 03:06.280
 When's the wedding?

03:06.280 --> 03:08.920
 You see Squid Game, I'm just living life.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.580
 Yeah, it's planned.

03:11.580 --> 03:12.420
 It's in New Orleans.

03:12.420 --> 03:14.980
 I'm from there and it's next year.

03:15.960 --> 03:16.880
 Are you married?

03:16.880 --> 03:17.760
 No, single.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.320
 Virgin?

03:19.320 --> 03:20.160
 Of course, yeah.

03:20.160 --> 03:20.980
 I can't imagine.

03:20.980 --> 03:21.880
 I bet you'd be great in bed.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.080
 You're ripped.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.560
 Best hairline in podcasting.

03:25.520 --> 03:26.360
 Yeah, I don't know.

03:26.360 --> 03:27.180
 I haven't tried yet.

03:27.180 --> 03:28.020
 So we'll have to see.

03:28.020 --> 03:28.860
 All right, well, let me know.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.840
 Pretty big hog on you?

03:30.840 --> 03:35.840
 Yeah, I could see you packing a crazy, crazy tool downtown.

03:36.760 --> 03:38.280
 That matters to girls?

03:38.280 --> 03:41.320
 Apparently, yeah, that's all I hear about.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.700
 Okay, New Orleans.

03:42.700 --> 03:43.780
 You grew up in New Orleans?

03:43.780 --> 03:45.280
 Yeah, born and raised.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.640
 Treme outside the French Quarter.

03:47.640 --> 03:48.480
 Have you ever been?

03:48.480 --> 03:50.560
 Yeah, don't remember it.

03:50.560 --> 03:51.680
 Oh, you drink?

03:51.680 --> 03:52.500
 Yeah, I drink.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.340
 Of course I drink.

03:53.340 --> 03:54.960
 I don't know, I can't tell if you have fun.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.000
 No, not really.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.480
 But in Russia, of course I drink vodka,

03:58.480 --> 03:59.320
 all that kind of stuff.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.140
 Oh, right, in Russia.

04:00.140 --> 04:00.980
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:00.980 --> 04:01.800
 Yes.

04:01.800 --> 04:02.640
 Gotta know.

04:02.640 --> 04:03.480
 Vodka.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.480
 Beer was just labeled an alcoholic beverage in 2011.

04:05.480 --> 04:06.440
 Fun fact.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.280
 What do you mean?

04:07.280 --> 04:08.440
 In Russia.

04:08.440 --> 04:09.320
 It was just drinks.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.880
 It was just like apple juice before.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.140
 It finally got declared legally as an alcoholic beverage.

04:14.140 --> 04:18.420
 Which means you can regulate it, that kind of thing.

04:18.420 --> 04:19.520
 I guess so.

04:19.520 --> 04:20.360
 Yeah.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.200
 See, that's where your brain goes.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.020
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:22.020 --> 04:22.860
 I just go, oh, these fucking Ruskies are.

04:22.860 --> 04:25.540
 I didn't even know there was rules about drinking.

04:25.540 --> 04:27.620
 This is good, I'm learning about Russia from you.

04:27.620 --> 04:31.940
 So what's the difficult memory, experience from childhood

04:31.940 --> 04:36.940
 in New Orleans that made you the man you are today?

04:38.580 --> 04:39.820
 I don't know if it made me the man,

04:39.820 --> 04:44.820
 but jeez, I had a lot of scuffles in the neighborhood.

04:45.900 --> 04:47.440
 I was the white kid in the neighborhood.

04:47.440 --> 04:51.660
 So I was automatically the odd man out, the minority,

04:51.660 --> 04:54.860
 the weirdo, the dork, the dweeb, the honky.

04:54.860 --> 04:58.860
 So just a lot of memories of like getting slapped

04:58.860 --> 05:01.340
 in the face by guys and just having to take it

05:01.340 --> 05:02.860
 because there's like five guys there.

05:02.860 --> 05:04.900
 And they'd be like, oh, look, you didn't even fight back.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.260
 And you're like, what am I going to do?

05:06.260 --> 05:07.920
 Hit you and then get beat up by these guys?

05:07.920 --> 05:12.220
 So a lot of that stuff was a big bummer growing up.

05:12.220 --> 05:16.100
 Got robbed all the time, lost a lot of bicycles,

05:16.100 --> 05:19.440
 had a bicycle taken from under me, that was pretty brutal.

05:19.440 --> 05:22.380
 These kids pulled up, you know, they're like 17

05:22.380 --> 05:27.120
 and I was 13 and I had a face paint on.

05:27.120 --> 05:30.220
 Like I had a, not black face, but I was at a summer camp

05:30.220 --> 05:32.480
 and I had a rainbow face painted on me.

05:32.480 --> 05:34.080
 We were helping kids that day.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.480
 So I let them put paint on me.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.040
 And so now I'm riding home.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.980
 What a mark, what a goober I am.

05:40.980 --> 05:43.020
 I'm riding home and these guys see me a mile away.

05:43.020 --> 05:44.900
 I'm a sitting duck and they go, we can take his bike.

05:44.900 --> 05:47.000
 He's got a fucking rainbow on his cheek.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.700
 So they just go, hey, you know, like cut in front of you.

05:50.700 --> 05:51.780
 They go, let me try your bike.

05:51.780 --> 05:53.140
 I go, I'm good, I'm good.

05:53.140 --> 05:54.480
 I knew what they wanted.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.260
 And they go, let me try the bike.

05:56.260 --> 05:58.420
 And then they just pushed me and took the bike.

05:58.420 --> 06:02.180
 So stuff like that was really shaping the insecurity,

06:02.180 --> 06:04.000
 the self worth.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
 Did it, cause I've been mugged when I was younger too.

06:09.380 --> 06:10.400
 Really?

06:10.400 --> 06:13.660
 Yeah, it changes your view of human nature a little bit.

06:13.660 --> 06:14.500
 For sure.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.820
 You go, wow, I didn't know people could be this mean.

06:16.820 --> 06:17.880
 This cool.

06:17.880 --> 06:18.720
 Yeah.

06:18.720 --> 06:19.540
 Inconsiderate.

06:19.540 --> 06:20.380
 I'm always worried about it.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.380
 Did I fart too much?

06:21.380 --> 06:22.560
 Am I annoying?

06:22.560 --> 06:23.820
 Am I pissing this guy off?

06:23.820 --> 06:25.540
 But what a way to live.

06:25.540 --> 06:28.340
 Just, I want the bike, I'm taking it.

06:28.340 --> 06:30.040
 Fuck his feelings.

06:30.040 --> 06:33.580
 For me, that quickly turned into realizing

06:33.580 --> 06:36.660
 that that's just a temporary phase that those folks are in.

06:36.660 --> 06:39.980
 Like they have a capacity to be good.

06:39.980 --> 06:40.820
 Sure.

06:40.820 --> 06:43.860
 For some reason, for me, that was a motivation to see,

06:43.860 --> 06:47.540
 can we discover, can we incentivize them

06:47.540 --> 06:49.500
 to find like a better path in life?

06:49.500 --> 06:53.380
 Like I wasn't like all like, I don't know, Gandhi about it.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.540
 Of course I was pissed and all those kinds of things,

06:55.540 --> 07:00.540
 but I don't know, it seemed like just the kind of thing

07:01.640 --> 07:03.420
 you might do when you're younger.

07:03.420 --> 07:04.260
 You hope.

07:04.260 --> 07:07.780
 But this is adult crime, obviously.

07:07.780 --> 07:09.340
 Yeah, I know, but yeah, exactly.

07:09.340 --> 07:12.080
 And then it solidifies and then you're beyond saving

07:12.080 --> 07:14.820
 at some point, but it's like, there's always,

07:14.820 --> 07:19.820
 there's always an opportunity to make a better life

07:19.980 --> 07:22.940
 for yourself, to become a better version of yourself.

07:22.940 --> 07:25.620
 Yeah, and I remember coming home crying with no bike

07:25.620 --> 07:29.780
 and my mom, my parents are like liberal to a fault.

07:29.780 --> 07:31.820
 You know, where they were like, oh, well they need it.

07:31.820 --> 07:33.620
 They're poor kids in the neighborhood.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.620
 And you're like, all right, but I also like have a bicycle

07:36.620 --> 07:39.100
 that I ride around, you know, and I also like to live

07:39.100 --> 07:42.900
 in an area that's not just, you know, riddled with theft

07:42.900 --> 07:45.780
 and vandalism, but they were just like, oh, they need it.

07:45.780 --> 07:48.120
 And then it was a moot point, we just moved on.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.880
 So I remember very young being like, all right,

07:49.880 --> 07:51.700
 I gotta figure my shit out.

07:53.380 --> 07:56.500
 Okay, so you said you were beat up quite a bit,

07:56.500 --> 07:57.580
 like bullying and stuff.

07:57.580 --> 07:59.980
 Pushed around, I was never hospitalized or anything,

07:59.980 --> 08:02.380
 but you know, you get a black guy here and there

08:02.380 --> 08:04.180
 and a bloody nose, stuff like that.

08:04.180 --> 08:05.900
 And it was just the outnumbered thing.

08:05.900 --> 08:08.180
 The violence didn't really bother me

08:08.180 --> 08:10.300
 because you're just kids, you're boys.

08:10.300 --> 08:14.140
 But it was the predatory, let's get him.

08:14.140 --> 08:15.980
 You know, we can take him down.

08:15.980 --> 08:17.860
 He's, you know, he's an easy target.

08:17.860 --> 08:20.320
 That's what kills you, the mental part.

08:22.340 --> 08:25.260
 Yeah, you know, until you actually said I didn't realize,

08:25.260 --> 08:28.380
 I've been in, what do you call them, scuffles.

08:28.380 --> 08:32.220
 And there was just one that stands out to me where, yeah.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.660
 Let's hear it, Faddy, bring it on.

08:34.660 --> 08:36.980
 And you do jujitsu and all that stuff, right?

08:36.980 --> 08:38.980
 Yeah, I can see the guns through the suit,

08:38.980 --> 08:40.100
 you're like John Wick.

08:40.100 --> 08:42.680
 All right, well, I used to have,

08:42.680 --> 08:43.940
 now you're gonna start making fun of me,

08:43.940 --> 08:46.340
 I used to have long hair for like a couple of years.

08:46.340 --> 08:48.620
 I was in a band playing music and stuff like that.

08:48.620 --> 08:51.860
 And there was, like most of the fights I've been in

08:51.860 --> 08:54.980
 were basically one on one, maybe a little bit like,

08:54.980 --> 08:58.780
 a little extra stuff, but not outnumbered.

08:58.780 --> 09:00.700
 And this one particular time,

09:01.660 --> 09:02.940
 I've learned a lot of lessons,

09:02.940 --> 09:06.020
 but one of them was, there was a fight started

09:06.020 --> 09:08.180
 between me and this other person.

09:08.180 --> 09:12.340
 And then his buddies, I guess, were there.

09:12.340 --> 09:13.980
 And they, as opposed to like breaking it up

09:13.980 --> 09:18.980
 or letting it happen, one of them grabbed my hair.

09:19.340 --> 09:20.940
 It's the first time anybody grabbed,

09:20.940 --> 09:22.940
 like used my hair in a fight,

09:22.940 --> 09:25.340
 which I haven't since then realized that that's actually

09:25.340 --> 09:27.660
 a really powerful grip and a powerful weapon.

09:27.660 --> 09:29.140
 Oh, very vulnerable of you.

09:29.140 --> 09:31.560
 And then my head got pulled back

09:31.560 --> 09:32.640
 and they pulled me down to the ground.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.420
 Like I couldn't do anything, it was so,

09:34.420 --> 09:36.940
 I remember being exceptionally frustrated.

09:36.940 --> 09:37.780
 Yes.

09:37.780 --> 09:40.460
 That was the feeling like, I can't do anything here.

09:40.460 --> 09:42.340
 I'm like trapped.

09:42.340 --> 09:44.780
 And then they were just like kicking me and hitting me

09:44.780 --> 09:45.620
 and stuff like that.

09:45.620 --> 09:47.460
 And the outnumbered part of it,

09:49.060 --> 09:51.440
 because I always kind of remember the trapped part

09:51.440 --> 09:55.100
 because I just hated from a fighting grappling perspective,

09:55.980 --> 09:58.700
 how like, the feeling was this isn't fair.

09:58.700 --> 09:59.940
 Yes, that's what it is.

09:59.940 --> 10:04.160
 It's a deep, deep unfairness that you just can't win.

10:04.160 --> 10:05.460
 The mob wins.

10:05.460 --> 10:06.780
 Yeah, the mob wins.

10:06.780 --> 10:07.860
 Scary stuff.

10:07.860 --> 10:09.980
 But it makes a man out of you in a weird way

10:09.980 --> 10:12.340
 that builds character, you realize life isn't fair early

10:12.340 --> 10:14.700
 and you go on from there.

10:14.700 --> 10:15.940
 So there's something there.

10:15.940 --> 10:16.980
 And look at you today.

10:16.980 --> 10:19.220
 They're probably eating out of a dumpster

10:19.220 --> 10:21.100
 at a Krispy Kreme and you're here,

10:21.100 --> 10:23.560
 got eight podcasts, you're doing great,

10:23.560 --> 10:26.680
 talking to giant titans of the industry.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.520
 No, I do remember returning home that night.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.580
 I mean that you said you were crying.

10:31.580 --> 10:33.140
 That's really formative.

10:33.140 --> 10:35.440
 Like that's the point in which you get to decide

10:35.440 --> 10:37.100
 what do I make of this moment?

10:37.100 --> 10:38.520
 I mean, especially when you're younger,

10:38.520 --> 10:40.780
 maybe it's not presented to you that way,

10:40.780 --> 10:43.540
 but like some of the greatest people in history

10:44.460 --> 10:47.220
 were bullied in these kinds of ways.

10:47.220 --> 10:48.980
 And they made something of themselves in this moment,

10:48.980 --> 10:51.580
 like bullied by life in some kind of way.

10:51.580 --> 10:53.300
 It's like an opportunity for growth.

10:53.300 --> 10:58.180
 It's weird, but like hardship even in small doses

10:58.180 --> 11:00.120
 is like an opportunity for growth.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.560
 Totally, I mean, look at Richard Pryor.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.620
 They say he's labeled as the best comedian of all time.

11:03.620 --> 11:04.760
 Grew up in a whorehouse,

11:04.760 --> 11:07.220
 watch his mom get plowed by these guys

11:07.220 --> 11:10.920
 in the middle of Indiana, I wanna say.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.740
 And just who had a harder life?

11:12.740 --> 11:14.060
 He would suck dick for drugs,

11:14.060 --> 11:17.380
 all this stuff growing up, beat up.

11:17.380 --> 11:20.340
 And then the weird thing is, oops, sorry,

11:20.340 --> 11:22.380
 that's my birth control alarm.

11:22.380 --> 11:24.460
 And then the whole world is like trying

11:24.460 --> 11:27.080
 to get rid of bullying, but we still do bullying,

11:27.080 --> 11:28.700
 but now it's accepted bullying.

11:28.700 --> 11:29.940
 It's very strange.

11:29.940 --> 11:33.140
 So you're a proponent of beating kids up,

11:33.140 --> 11:33.980
 is that what you're saying?

11:33.980 --> 11:35.540
 Yes, and sex with them.

11:35.540 --> 11:36.820
 All right.

11:36.820 --> 11:40.600
 But no, I just think it's part of life

11:40.600 --> 11:43.100
 and it's horrible, it's like rain, you gotta have it.

11:43.100 --> 11:45.420
 Look, a rainy day is a bummer, but you need it.

11:45.420 --> 11:47.820
 And I think it's similar to that.

11:49.100 --> 11:53.020
 What was your relationship like with your mom, your dad?

11:53.020 --> 11:54.900
 What are some memorable moments with them?

11:54.900 --> 11:56.020
 What did you learn from them?

11:56.020 --> 11:59.400
 Good parents, they're giving, thoughtful.

12:01.740 --> 12:05.140
 A little out to lunch, they were workaholics,

12:05.140 --> 12:08.600
 so it was hard to get a lot out of them.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.540
 And my dad was kind of an angry dad.

12:10.540 --> 12:13.340
 I think he just had like a weird childhood

12:13.340 --> 12:14.460
 and he's just trying to make it

12:14.460 --> 12:16.780
 and he's trying to provide, but it's hard.

12:16.780 --> 12:18.780
 And we live in this horrible neighborhood

12:18.780 --> 12:20.620
 and we're getting robbed all the time.

12:22.260 --> 12:24.420
 So life was kind of coming down on him all the time.

12:24.420 --> 12:27.900
 So then he'll take it out on you or whoever, he would snap.

12:27.900 --> 12:31.180
 But great parents, they cared, they put us first,

12:32.060 --> 12:36.940
 but there wasn't a lot of, you ever go to a friend's house

12:36.940 --> 12:39.220
 as a kid and there's like a picture of a ski trip

12:39.220 --> 12:40.780
 and you're like, ski trip?

12:40.780 --> 12:42.620
 What the hell is that about?

12:42.620 --> 12:46.460
 It wasn't a lot of that and smart, very smart people,

12:46.460 --> 12:49.620
 but I don't know how well they were at socializing.

12:49.620 --> 12:51.220
 So you never like bonded with them

12:51.220 --> 12:53.020
 like on a deep human level?

12:53.020 --> 12:54.580
 Some bonding, but rarely deep.

12:54.580 --> 12:57.300
 Yeah, it was just almost coworker.

12:57.300 --> 12:59.300
 Hey, cold out, huh?

12:59.300 --> 13:00.140
 What?

13:00.140 --> 13:01.300
 It's cold out, huh?

13:01.300 --> 13:02.260
 Oh yeah, like that kind of stuff.

13:02.260 --> 13:03.100
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:03.100 --> 13:03.920
 Yeah, yeah, I got you.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.340
 Get there a little bit, but my parents are done.

13:06.340 --> 13:08.780
 I hope they never saw this, but they would do a thing

13:08.780 --> 13:10.740
 where my dad especially would do a thing

13:10.740 --> 13:13.340
 where he would, he knew how to cut you down

13:13.340 --> 13:15.940
 right to the bone and so after a while you're like,

13:15.940 --> 13:17.180
 I'm not even gonna interact with this guy

13:17.180 --> 13:19.980
 because he can get you so well.

13:19.980 --> 13:22.300
 One time we were at like a Thanksgiving,

13:22.300 --> 13:25.480
 some kind of family event and all the cousins are there

13:25.480 --> 13:26.820
 and I remember I was holding court.

13:26.820 --> 13:30.240
 I was a young boy finding my comedic legs

13:30.240 --> 13:33.660
 in this weird tumultuous sea we call a family

13:33.660 --> 13:38.040
 and I was killing and my dad comes out and he goes,

13:38.040 --> 13:39.620
 what are you holding court?

13:39.620 --> 13:42.540
 And I was like, ah, and I felt like I was this big.

13:42.540 --> 13:44.140
 I just whoo, shrunk down.

13:44.140 --> 13:45.700
 He just nailed it because in my head I'm like,

13:45.700 --> 13:47.680
 I'm holding court, look at me, I got the whole room

13:47.680 --> 13:49.980
 and he goes, what are you, what are you holding court here?

13:49.980 --> 13:51.500
 And I'm like, who the hell do you think you are?

13:51.500 --> 13:53.980
 And I was like, he's right, I shouldn't be holding court,

13:53.980 --> 13:55.380
 who the fuck am I, I'm nobody.

13:55.380 --> 13:57.560
 So stuff like that.

13:57.560 --> 13:58.700
 Was he aware of that you think?

13:58.700 --> 14:01.300
 He wasn't, he wasn't, I don't think he was, but.

14:01.300 --> 14:06.340
 Do you give parents a pass when they're unaware

14:06.340 --> 14:09.540
 of the destructive, like is it better when they're unaware?

14:09.540 --> 14:11.160
 Because it seems like that's the way.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.000
 That's true.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.900
 That's the way parents often fail

14:13.900 --> 14:18.260
 is they're not intentionally malevolent,

14:18.260 --> 14:20.140
 they're just like clueless.

14:20.140 --> 14:22.780
 Yeah, it's a bittersweet thing

14:22.780 --> 14:24.360
 because you're like, well, okay, he's not malicious,

14:24.360 --> 14:26.060
 he's not trying to hurt me,

14:26.060 --> 14:29.940
 but also he doesn't know he hurt me.

14:29.940 --> 14:31.260
 I don't know, it's tough

14:31.260 --> 14:33.660
 because if he was trying to hurt you,

14:33.660 --> 14:35.460
 I guess that would be worse.

14:35.460 --> 14:39.500
 So you're the fully baked Mark Norman cake at this point

14:39.500 --> 14:41.880
 Yeah, it's a shitty cake.

14:43.820 --> 14:45.360
 Fruit salad.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.860
 You know, the sense of self worth you mentioned.

14:49.740 --> 14:50.980
 I think in your comedy,

14:50.980 --> 14:52.900
 there's a sense like you hate yourself.

14:52.900 --> 14:54.140
 You think?

14:54.140 --> 14:55.340
 I didn't know if that came through.

14:55.340 --> 14:57.380
 Shit, I was trying to hide that part.

14:57.380 --> 14:58.280
 God damn it.

14:58.280 --> 15:01.540
 I mean, when you like in the privacy of your own mind,

15:02.480 --> 15:07.300
 are you able to love yourself or is it mostly self hate?

15:07.300 --> 15:09.020
 Jeez, what happened to this podcast?

15:09.020 --> 15:11.100
 I didn't know I was on Dr. Phil.

15:11.100 --> 15:11.940
 Dr. Phil.

15:11.940 --> 15:13.580
 I thought we were gonna talk about engineering

15:13.580 --> 15:17.140
 and climate change and rockets.

15:17.140 --> 15:17.980
 We'll get there.

15:17.980 --> 15:18.800
 Okay.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.020
 Starts with love, goes to rockets.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.220
 All right, I like that.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.420
 I like that's a t shirt.

15:24.940 --> 15:25.780
 I mean, like.

15:25.780 --> 15:26.600
 What's the question?

15:26.600 --> 15:27.900
 Sorry.

15:27.900 --> 15:29.100
 Do I feel love?

15:29.100 --> 15:29.940
 No, no, like.

15:29.940 --> 15:31.180
 Do I love myself?

15:31.180 --> 15:36.060
 Yeah, yeah, so are you like this engine

15:36.060 --> 15:37.780
 of being self critical

15:37.780 --> 15:40.700
 of just being constantly anxious

15:40.700 --> 15:43.940
 about how the world perceives you, these kinds of things?

15:43.940 --> 15:47.260
 Is this something that you just go to for comedy

15:47.260 --> 15:50.180
 or is this who you are as a human being?

15:50.180 --> 15:52.100
 I think I don't wanna explore it.

15:52.100 --> 15:54.140
 I think I get around it.

15:54.140 --> 15:55.360
 You know, I tap dance around it,

15:55.360 --> 15:57.940
 but I get it out a little with my act maybe,

15:57.940 --> 15:59.380
 because I can't do it.

15:59.380 --> 16:00.580
 I'm not doing it in real life.

16:00.580 --> 16:04.780
 So I'll get out this no love, not loving myself.

16:04.780 --> 16:06.140
 I don't know who wants to love themself.

16:06.140 --> 16:07.500
 Everybody always like you gotta love yourself.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.060
 And then when you meet somebody who does love yourself,

16:09.060 --> 16:11.300
 you're like, I fucking hate this guy.

16:11.300 --> 16:12.660
 Don't you hate the guy who's upset?

16:12.660 --> 16:14.420
 I'm great, I'm awesome.

16:14.420 --> 16:15.260
 Life is good.

16:15.260 --> 16:17.100
 You're like, ah, this guy sucks.

16:17.100 --> 16:18.940
 I'd rather an insecure guy.

16:18.940 --> 16:20.180
 So maybe I wanna stay insecure.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.740
 Maybe I don't wanna find this love for myself.

16:22.740 --> 16:23.780
 Well, okay.

16:23.780 --> 16:27.820
 So self love, like just appreciating who you are,

16:27.820 --> 16:30.060
 or like appreciating the moment of being grateful

16:30.060 --> 16:32.100
 doesn't have to express itself

16:32.100 --> 16:34.720
 by the guy saying I'm awesome.

16:34.720 --> 16:35.560
 True.

16:35.560 --> 16:36.580
 It's more just like humility.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.420
 It's just like walking calmly through the world

16:38.420 --> 16:39.860
 and just being grateful to be alive,

16:39.860 --> 16:40.700
 that kind of thing.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.220
 That's good.

16:42.220 --> 16:43.700
 And like, oh, being appreciative

16:43.700 --> 16:45.140
 of all the accomplishments you've made so far.

16:45.140 --> 16:49.180
 I say all this because mostly I'm extremely self critical

16:49.180 --> 16:50.420
 in everything I do.

16:50.420 --> 16:54.180
 And so, and I kind of enjoy it.

16:54.180 --> 16:57.140
 I think it's a nice little engine that it makes it fun.

16:57.140 --> 16:57.980
 It makes life fun,

16:57.980 --> 17:01.980
 because it's like if you hate everything you do,

17:01.980 --> 17:04.180
 like you've done in the past,

17:04.180 --> 17:06.500
 that gives you like, all right, we can do better.

17:06.500 --> 17:09.500
 Yes, but that's the key is making yourself critical.

17:09.500 --> 17:10.620
 Always trying to get better.

17:10.620 --> 17:11.940
 I could change this, I could tweak this,

17:11.940 --> 17:13.280
 I could improve this.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.500
 When you just go, I hate that I do this, I suck,

17:15.500 --> 17:16.340
 you just shut down.

17:16.340 --> 17:19.540
 So that's the key is always being productive

17:19.540 --> 17:21.380
 with the criticism.

17:21.380 --> 17:22.700
 Yeah, and the basics of life,

17:22.700 --> 17:24.740
 I'm just like grateful for it, to be alive.

17:24.740 --> 17:27.660
 That's nice to be coupled that with self criticism.

17:27.660 --> 17:30.460
 Two legs, again, the hairline, the hog,

17:30.460 --> 17:32.980
 the muscles, the world.

17:32.980 --> 17:34.220
 You got a good brain on you.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.740
 I mean, you're lucky.

17:35.740 --> 17:37.340
 You're in the top,

17:37.340 --> 17:39.640
 most people are fat as shit at Burger King right now,

17:39.640 --> 17:40.980
 hitting their kids.

17:40.980 --> 17:41.820
 Yeah.

17:41.820 --> 17:43.860
 You're in a Ramada hotel,

17:43.860 --> 17:47.660
 sitting with a low level comedian.

17:47.660 --> 17:49.620
 For the record, I ate McDonald's last night.

17:49.620 --> 17:52.180
 Oh, all right, well, you're human.

17:52.180 --> 17:54.580
 Well, just so you know, this is not me defending,

17:54.580 --> 17:56.020
 I'm not sponsored by McDonald's,

17:56.020 --> 17:57.620
 but I mostly eat meat,

17:57.620 --> 18:01.340
 and there's nothing wrong with the beef they have.

18:01.340 --> 18:04.020
 It's actually one of the easiest ways late at night.

18:04.020 --> 18:05.420
 I think it's worse.

18:05.420 --> 18:07.020
 I don't know if it's actually cow.

18:07.020 --> 18:07.980
 It's actually rats.

18:07.980 --> 18:09.140
 Yeah, you're right.

18:09.140 --> 18:10.500
 But hey, it's just meat.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.920
 I'm a meat guy myself.

18:12.940 --> 18:14.820
 They say in 20 years, we're gonna look back

18:14.820 --> 18:16.540
 and go, can you believe people ate meat?

18:16.540 --> 18:18.540
 It's gonna look like somebody like slavery.

18:18.540 --> 18:20.340
 Yeah, there's some ethical,

18:20.340 --> 18:22.640
 difficult things with factory farming.

18:22.640 --> 18:26.140
 Yeah, so let's ride it out now while we still got it.

18:26.140 --> 18:27.560
 And now it's on record.

18:28.820 --> 18:31.420
 Tom Waits says something about New York.

18:31.420 --> 18:32.300
 You like Tom Waits?

18:32.300 --> 18:33.460
 I think he's underrated.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.860
 I think he's got great,

18:34.860 --> 18:38.020
 he's got a great, he's great at quips and quotes.

18:38.020 --> 18:39.300
 Check him out on YouTube.

18:39.300 --> 18:41.820
 He's got some montages and super cuts

18:41.820 --> 18:43.460
 of him being hilarious.

18:43.460 --> 18:44.620
 What does he say about,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.100
 I'd rather have a bottle in front of me

18:49.100 --> 18:50.420
 than a frontal lobotomy.

18:50.420 --> 18:51.420
 That was the one.

18:51.420 --> 18:52.240
 That was the one that sold me.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.540
 I was like, this guy's awesome.

18:53.540 --> 18:54.860
 Yeah, but his music,

18:54.860 --> 18:56.900
 cause he's just a genius musician.

18:56.900 --> 18:57.740
 Yeah.

18:57.740 --> 18:59.740
 Anyway, he was talking about New York.

18:59.740 --> 19:01.940
 I was walking around, I'm in New York right now.

19:01.940 --> 19:03.380
 We're in New York right now.

19:03.380 --> 19:04.860
 It's still a magical city to me.

19:04.860 --> 19:06.860
 A lot of people are quite cynical about it,

19:06.860 --> 19:08.220
 about the state of things, but.

19:08.220 --> 19:09.060
 Go again.

19:09.060 --> 19:13.220
 Not like Michael Malice, like a lot of friends of mine,

19:13.220 --> 19:15.880
 they're just a lot of folks in San Francisco and New York,

19:15.880 --> 19:17.180
 there's something about the pandemic

19:17.180 --> 19:19.540
 where people have become quite cynical

19:19.540 --> 19:22.100
 about the place they are and they try to escape.

19:22.100 --> 19:22.940
 It's interesting.

19:22.940 --> 19:24.580
 I mean, they're asking some difficult questions

19:24.580 --> 19:26.020
 about what they are in life.

19:26.020 --> 19:29.100
 They're having like a self imposed midlife crisis.

19:29.100 --> 19:32.260
 It's good, I think, for everybody to go through this process.

19:32.260 --> 19:35.540
 But I think, I hope New York reemerges.

19:35.540 --> 19:36.380
 It will.

19:36.380 --> 19:37.900
 As the flourishing place for the weirdos.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.700
 Anyway, Tom Waits said,

19:39.700 --> 19:44.700
 New York, of course, is to be in endless surreal situations

19:45.420 --> 19:48.460
 where a $50,000 gun metal Mercedes

19:48.460 --> 19:50.500
 pulls up in a puddle of blood

19:50.500 --> 19:54.540
 and out steps a 25 carat blonde with a $2 wristwatch.

19:54.540 --> 19:55.380
 Woo!

19:55.380 --> 19:56.780
 And he goes, he keeps going on.

19:56.780 --> 19:58.700
 So like, it's like a.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.340
 That's like bars, he's like a rapper.

20:00.340 --> 20:02.660
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's good.

20:02.660 --> 20:06.260
 But basically, just the absurdity of it all.

20:06.260 --> 20:10.740
 Lots of money, lots of weirdos, degenerates,

20:10.740 --> 20:14.160
 and dreamers, and the whole mix of it.

20:14.160 --> 20:18.020
 Do you think that's an accurate description

20:18.020 --> 20:19.620
 of what New York is today?

20:19.620 --> 20:22.220
 Like, is there still place for the weirdos

20:22.220 --> 20:24.940
 and just the interesting artists,

20:24.940 --> 20:29.760
 the edgy, the comedians, the creators,

20:29.760 --> 20:34.760
 the entrepreneurs, as opposed to like Wall Street,

20:35.180 --> 20:38.500
 as opposed to like rich folk,

20:38.500 --> 20:40.900
 and then like hopeless folk?

20:40.900 --> 20:42.660
 Yeah, I think it's definitely changed a lot.

20:42.660 --> 20:46.140
 There's a tiny corner for us weirdo artists.

20:46.140 --> 20:48.260
 New York used to be where you went to make it

20:48.260 --> 20:51.060
 as a painter or whatever, a comedian or a singer.

20:51.060 --> 20:53.180
 And there were all these dives and shit boxes

20:53.180 --> 20:54.680
 and all these places you could go.

20:54.680 --> 20:57.020
 And now it's more Pink Berries

20:57.020 --> 20:59.500
 and Subway Sandwiches and Chase Banks.

20:59.500 --> 21:03.900
 So it's definitely lost a lot of its creative edge.

21:03.900 --> 21:05.540
 It's just money, money keeps coming in.

21:05.540 --> 21:07.780
 And now you see all these comedians move to Nashville,

21:07.780 --> 21:09.720
 Austin, Denver, whatever.

21:09.720 --> 21:13.660
 So it doesn't have the power it used to have

21:13.660 --> 21:16.000
 of like, you gotta be here if you wanna make it.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.940
 That's definitely gone.

21:17.940 --> 21:20.100
 So that hurt the city a lot.

21:20.100 --> 21:22.900
 The city is way more soulless.

21:22.900 --> 21:24.620
 When I moved here in 07,

21:24.620 --> 21:26.180
 I mean, not only did I get mugged three times

21:26.180 --> 21:31.140
 in the first year, but it was a hub of like,

21:31.140 --> 21:33.140
 it felt like things were happening here.

21:33.140 --> 21:34.900
 It was an energy, it was electricity.

21:34.900 --> 21:35.940
 And we still have the electricity,

21:35.940 --> 21:38.120
 but it's also maybe just cause there's Times Square,

21:38.120 --> 21:41.120
 there's Soho, there's Wall Street.

21:41.120 --> 21:44.120
 So we got the staples, but there is a little bit of that.

21:44.120 --> 21:45.300
 It's almost like a marriage.

21:45.300 --> 21:46.420
 Like, yeah, we're in love,

21:46.420 --> 21:49.500
 but it's not as passionate as it once was.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.700
 That's how I would equate New York.

21:51.700 --> 21:52.600
 What gives you hope?

21:52.600 --> 21:54.660
 You're pretty hopeful about it though.

21:54.660 --> 21:57.100
 I'm hopeful just cause I know it's magical

21:57.100 --> 21:59.500
 and I think it has to be.

21:59.500 --> 22:01.060
 I mean, it's the epicenter of America.

22:01.060 --> 22:02.980
 Like this is where the immigrants came

22:02.980 --> 22:05.380
 and this is where the stock market is

22:05.380 --> 22:08.260
 and the entertainment industry, a lot of it is here.

22:08.260 --> 22:12.100
 So I think it's gonna happen,

22:12.100 --> 22:14.620
 but something like the bottom has to fall out

22:14.620 --> 22:16.640
 and then people have to move back here and all that.

22:16.640 --> 22:19.580
 So something, the corporations are kind of fucking us.

22:19.580 --> 22:20.820
 They're just buying everything.

22:20.820 --> 22:22.060
 Well, that's true for everything.

22:22.060 --> 22:23.220
 That's true for everything.

22:23.220 --> 22:24.980
 This is true for Austin probably as well.

22:24.980 --> 22:27.140
 People are just buying out land and all that kind of stuff.

22:27.140 --> 22:28.860
 You always hear a Hemingway and Dali

22:28.860 --> 22:32.340
 and all these guys went to Paris in the 20s

22:32.340 --> 22:34.020
 or whatever that was.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.100
 I get it now.

22:35.100 --> 22:36.780
 I used to be like, why do these guys go to Paris?

22:36.780 --> 22:38.200
 Why do these artists?

22:38.200 --> 22:39.040
 And now I get it.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.180
 Cause it's like, it's freer there.

22:41.180 --> 22:43.580
 That's why Austin became like that Paris

22:43.580 --> 22:44.980
 where everybody's like, I gotta get out of LA.

22:44.980 --> 22:46.540
 I'm going there.

22:46.540 --> 22:50.620
 And maybe, but we came back from that.

22:50.620 --> 22:53.520
 70s were wild and 90s were cool.

22:53.520 --> 22:54.740
 So maybe it'll come back.

22:54.740 --> 22:55.860
 Might just take a decade.

22:55.860 --> 22:57.700
 Well, there's always, that's how stories are told.

22:57.700 --> 23:02.700
 There's always pockets of like Paris within New York.

23:02.820 --> 23:03.840
 True, true.

23:03.840 --> 23:07.980
 There's just an opportunity to let your weird flourish

23:07.980 --> 23:09.620
 is there in New York, I'm sure.

23:09.620 --> 23:10.700
 There, I mean.

23:12.700 --> 23:13.520
 It's there.

23:13.520 --> 23:14.360
 You gotta find it.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.060
 Before it was front and center.

23:16.060 --> 23:18.160
 What's your favorite thing about New York?

23:18.160 --> 23:22.060
 Like what kind of things just like.

23:22.060 --> 23:23.220
 I mean, how long is this pod?

23:23.220 --> 23:24.040
 I could go on.

23:24.040 --> 23:27.460
 It's just, it's too much to put into one hour.

23:27.460 --> 23:31.300
 We've got other questions, but I love that one neighborhood

23:31.300 --> 23:33.220
 is wildly different than the next.

23:33.220 --> 23:35.400
 I'm in Little Italy and then you take four steps.

23:35.400 --> 23:36.500
 Now I'm in Chinatown.

23:36.500 --> 23:39.560
 I mean, and then the history there and then the stories

23:39.560 --> 23:42.420
 and the food and the culture and all that.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.140
 And then you go 10 feet over here.

23:44.140 --> 23:45.160
 Now you're in Brooklyn.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.080
 And this is insane as a whole nother world.

23:47.080 --> 23:49.940
 And it's almost like a little America in one,

23:51.740 --> 23:54.100
 you know, city and it's great.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.700
 And just the fact that they pulled it off

23:56.700 --> 23:59.380
 like Fifth Avenue goes way up.

23:59.380 --> 24:00.740
 And you're like, there's a billionaire's house

24:00.740 --> 24:01.780
 next to a hobo.

24:01.780 --> 24:04.580
 And then this is a black guy who's fighting with a Cuban guy

24:04.580 --> 24:07.340
 and an Asian guy is trying to get in the middle of them.

24:07.340 --> 24:09.380
 And the cabbie's from the Middle East.

24:09.380 --> 24:12.000
 And there's so many beautiful women here.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.620
 And there's so many brilliant minds here.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.020
 And the pace is great.

24:15.020 --> 24:16.140
 It keeps people moving.

24:16.140 --> 24:18.720
 I mean, it just, you can't beat it.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.580
 And the city will fuck you in the ass too.

24:20.580 --> 24:21.420
 Don't get me wrong.

24:21.420 --> 24:23.900
 You landed JFK and you're like, oh God, I got mugged.

24:23.900 --> 24:27.460
 My Uber driver called me a homo.

24:27.460 --> 24:29.380
 I stepped in human shit.

24:29.380 --> 24:30.600
 Where the fuck am I?

24:31.800 --> 24:33.460
 So yeah, it's bad news.

24:33.460 --> 24:35.900
 But that bad news, it's almost like the bullying.

24:35.900 --> 24:38.380
 It kills you in a weird way, but it makes you stronger.

24:38.380 --> 24:40.540
 And you build more layers and layers and layers.

24:40.540 --> 24:41.740
 That's why some new guys,

24:41.740 --> 24:44.140
 some hayseed from Milwaukee shows up.

24:44.140 --> 24:46.020
 You've been here 10 years and you go,

24:46.020 --> 24:47.420
 let me help you out.

24:47.420 --> 24:50.220
 Cause you gotta adjust.

24:50.220 --> 24:52.820
 You're gonna get your ass kicked for like six months.

24:52.820 --> 24:54.100
 But I know the ropes a little,

24:54.100 --> 24:55.940
 and I think you need a little of that.

24:55.940 --> 25:00.020
 If the treadmill's not on, you're not gonna run.

25:00.020 --> 25:01.320
 New York, the treadmill's on.

25:01.320 --> 25:03.980
 So it just makes you run and it makes you better.

25:03.980 --> 25:04.820
 And look, it wears on you.

25:04.820 --> 25:06.260
 You probably lose 10 years of your life

25:06.260 --> 25:09.740
 living in New York versus Indianapolis,

25:09.740 --> 25:12.580
 but it's a better life.

25:12.580 --> 25:13.980
 Have you seen 25th Hour?

25:13.980 --> 25:15.940
 Yeah, it's been a while.

25:15.940 --> 25:17.460
 Spike Lee joint.

25:17.460 --> 25:18.700
 Yeah, Spike Lee joint.

25:18.700 --> 25:23.340
 I mean, at Norton, there's a whole monologue there

25:23.340 --> 25:24.180
 about New York.

25:24.180 --> 25:25.180
 Oh, that's right.

25:25.180 --> 25:30.100
 They're talking about just, he has like a mix.

25:30.100 --> 25:31.940
 There's like melancholy music, I think,

25:31.940 --> 25:34.100
 or just a melancholy feel to the whole thing.

25:34.100 --> 25:37.100
 But there's an anger and a disgust with the city.

25:37.100 --> 25:38.780
 But through the anger and the disgust

25:38.780 --> 25:40.940
 comes out like a love for the city.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.020
 Same with, was Taxi Driver in New York?

25:43.020 --> 25:45.260
 Oh yeah, it's going crazy.

25:45.260 --> 25:48.620
 Yeah, so like that, there's something about, what is that?

25:48.620 --> 25:53.620
 What is that grit of the city that like pushes you down?

25:56.180 --> 25:57.280
 Well, that's the beauty of this city

25:57.280 --> 25:59.780
 is it's this tribal human nature,

25:59.780 --> 26:04.180
 like the sex shops and fistfights and racism

26:04.180 --> 26:05.500
 and all this tension,

26:05.500 --> 26:08.660
 but yet it's the epicenter of technology and finance

26:08.660 --> 26:10.540
 and sophistication on Fifth Avenue.

26:10.540 --> 26:13.820
 So you get that juxtaposition.

26:13.820 --> 26:14.700
 It's kind of like in Boston.

26:14.700 --> 26:16.900
 You go to Boston, they got MIT, they got Harvard,

26:16.900 --> 26:18.300
 they got all this shit.

26:18.300 --> 26:21.780
 And then they got the fishermen, the blue collar douchebags,

26:21.780 --> 26:23.860
 the Irish guys, the immigrants,

26:23.860 --> 26:26.780
 and you get that mix of like insanely smart

26:26.780 --> 26:30.180
 with wicked pisser and these two worlds.

26:30.180 --> 26:31.420
 And that's a good thing.

26:31.420 --> 26:33.760
 It's like when a black guy fucks an Asian lady,

26:33.760 --> 26:35.420
 that's a good looking kid.

26:35.420 --> 26:36.860
 You get a mix.

26:36.860 --> 26:39.460
 We're mixing two totally different things

26:39.460 --> 26:40.780
 are coming together and it makes it,

26:40.780 --> 26:43.140
 it's like peanut butter and chocolate.

26:43.140 --> 26:45.540
 Peanut butter and chocolate, I've never tried that.

26:45.540 --> 26:46.380
 What?

26:46.380 --> 26:47.220
 Peanut butter, maybe I have.

26:47.220 --> 26:48.780
 You're talking about Reese's, man.

26:48.780 --> 26:50.740
 Like Reese's, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:50.740 --> 26:52.180
 Oh, it's the best candy.

26:52.180 --> 26:55.660
 Yeah, without the fakeness of LA,

26:55.660 --> 27:00.460
 without the kind of, with the facade.

27:00.460 --> 27:01.760
 Yeah, LA's tough.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.720
 What's the difference between LA comedy

27:05.720 --> 27:07.060
 and New York comedy to you?

27:08.260 --> 27:10.580
 I think one place you kind of go to make it

27:10.580 --> 27:13.460
 and be discovered and be loved,

27:13.460 --> 27:16.180
 and one place you go, you can get all that in New York too,

27:16.180 --> 27:19.060
 but I think in New York, it's more of a school,

27:19.060 --> 27:21.060
 a bootcamp of comedy.

27:21.060 --> 27:22.740
 Let's make great comedy.

27:22.740 --> 27:23.980
 Let's make original comedy.

27:23.980 --> 27:26.260
 Let's watch the other guys and gals

27:26.260 --> 27:29.380
 who are at the show at the clubs and learn from them

27:29.380 --> 27:33.200
 and try to hang out with them and absorb some of them.

27:33.200 --> 27:36.060
 And in LA, it's like, when am I on?

27:36.060 --> 27:38.080
 I'm next, get out of my way.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.900
 I'm the star here.

27:39.900 --> 27:41.320
 I'm a bigger star than you.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.620
 Oh, this guy's actually a big star.

27:42.620 --> 27:44.680
 I got to outwork, you know, it's just a lot of that

27:44.680 --> 27:46.460
 instead of like, damn, that was funny.

27:46.460 --> 27:47.860
 I got to be that funny.

27:47.860 --> 27:48.980
 Damn, I wish I had a joke.

27:48.980 --> 27:51.020
 And look, I don't want to speak for LA comics

27:51.020 --> 27:54.340
 because there's, you know, Bill Burr, Anthony Jeslenek,

27:54.340 --> 27:56.840
 brilliant LA comic, but they all cut their teeth

27:56.840 --> 27:58.520
 in New York, just saying.

27:58.520 --> 28:00.220
 Then they moved to LA.

28:00.220 --> 28:01.060
 That's a good point.

28:01.060 --> 28:03.360
 You know, Ali Wong, all these people, killer comics,

28:03.360 --> 28:07.220
 but New York, started in New York, moved to New York.

28:07.220 --> 28:09.300
 There is something about comics that stay in New York

28:09.300 --> 28:11.060
 for a long time though, like Dave Attell.

28:11.060 --> 28:12.580
 Ah, you know about Dave?

28:12.580 --> 28:14.340
 Yeah, yeah, he wants to do this podcast.

28:14.340 --> 28:15.180
 He does?

28:15.180 --> 28:16.860
 Yeah, I'm a huge fan of Dave Attell.

28:16.860 --> 28:21.100
 But it's like, he almost like he doesn't want to make it.

28:21.100 --> 28:21.940
 I don't know.

28:21.940 --> 28:23.780
 I mean, you probably know him, but like,

28:23.780 --> 28:27.900
 it feels like you just, maybe it's romanticizing it,

28:27.900 --> 28:31.180
 but you're like, you almost just love the art of comedy,

28:31.180 --> 28:34.060
 like becoming funnier, crafting the jokes,

28:34.060 --> 28:35.700
 becoming funnier than the other comics,

28:35.700 --> 28:37.580
 like competing with each other kind of thing,

28:37.580 --> 28:41.180
 not over like money or fame or any of that,

28:41.180 --> 28:43.180
 just purely the comedy of it.

28:43.180 --> 28:44.260
 Totally, that's Dave.

28:44.260 --> 28:45.100
 That's him in a nutshell.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.780
 He's like that guy in the movies in the 80s,

28:46.780 --> 28:48.100
 action movies, where they're like,

28:48.100 --> 28:50.620
 they go up to a creek in Montana,

28:50.620 --> 28:51.820
 and some guy's living in a cabin,

28:51.820 --> 28:54.320
 and he's sharpening a stick, and they go,

28:54.320 --> 28:56.160
 the Russians are coming, they're invading.

28:56.160 --> 28:57.860
 We need you, you're the best commando.

28:57.860 --> 28:59.580
 And he's like, I gave that up, man.

28:59.580 --> 29:00.820
 I'm done with that lifestyle.

29:00.820 --> 29:02.620
 They're like, but you're the best, we need you.

29:02.620 --> 29:04.620
 And he has to suit up eventually.

29:04.620 --> 29:06.180
 You know, he looks at a picture of his dead wife,

29:06.180 --> 29:07.460
 and he goes, fuck it, I'm going.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.420
 And then they, you know, fight the Ruskies.

29:09.420 --> 29:11.220
 But he's that guy.

29:11.220 --> 29:12.740
 He just is gifted.

29:12.740 --> 29:16.820
 He's like got a gift from Allah, and he's the best.

29:16.820 --> 29:18.660
 Yeah, a lot of comics give him props.

29:18.660 --> 29:20.140
 That's always surprising to me.

29:20.140 --> 29:21.660
 Because it's surprising to me

29:21.660 --> 29:25.380
 because he hasn't really made it, like big.

29:25.380 --> 29:26.300
 Well, he did.

29:26.300 --> 29:27.380
 In the 90s, he was huge.

29:27.380 --> 29:28.580
 He had his own TV show.

29:28.580 --> 29:30.980
 Yeah, yeah, that show was awesome.

29:30.980 --> 29:34.260
 But I mean, like as big as I think he deserves to be.

29:34.260 --> 29:35.100
 Well, that's art.

29:35.100 --> 29:37.900
 The mainstream shit is always the worst.

29:37.900 --> 29:40.500
 It's like McDonald's versus some hole in the wall.

29:40.500 --> 29:43.860
 I know I'm shitting on McDonald's again, but it's good.

29:43.860 --> 29:46.140
 And you know, certain comics we could name are good,

29:46.140 --> 29:51.140
 but the delicacy is going to be less talked about

29:51.980 --> 29:56.980
 and less household namey than the mainstream hacky shit.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.740
 Yeah, it's funny because he hasn't,

29:59.740 --> 30:04.100
 I think it was on Joe Rogan's show once, maybe.

30:04.100 --> 30:04.940
 Yeah, once or twice.

30:04.940 --> 30:07.700
 And he was with somebody else.

30:07.700 --> 30:08.540
 Jeff Ross?

30:08.540 --> 30:10.380
 Yeah, he might have known Jeff Ross.

30:10.380 --> 30:12.260
 Oh yeah, because they did that like two mics thing,

30:12.260 --> 30:13.100
 whatever.

30:13.100 --> 30:13.920
 Oh, big mics, yeah.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.440
 Yeah.

30:15.440 --> 30:16.700
 But he's the quickest guy.

30:16.700 --> 30:17.820
 There's no one funnier.

30:17.820 --> 30:18.940
 Yeah.

30:18.940 --> 30:22.300
 Yeah, him and you, you're super quick.

30:22.300 --> 30:24.740
 Your appearance on, recent appearance on Rogan's hilarious.

30:24.740 --> 30:25.580
 Oh, thanks.

30:25.580 --> 30:27.060
 Just so fast.

30:27.060 --> 30:29.560
 You're on with Ari and...

30:29.560 --> 30:30.400
 Shane Gillis.

30:30.400 --> 30:31.220
 Shane Gillis.

30:31.220 --> 30:32.060
 Yeah, that was fun.

30:32.060 --> 30:33.580
 We're going back in January.

30:33.580 --> 30:35.620
 I don't know when this comes out.

30:35.620 --> 30:36.920
 This has never come out.

30:38.060 --> 30:38.980
 Neither will you.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.340
 We're having fun.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.180
 Yep.

30:42.180 --> 30:46.320
 All right, so what does it feel like to bomb

30:46.320 --> 30:49.140
 in standup comedy, like to fail?

30:49.140 --> 30:51.020
 Maybe the psychology of it first,

30:51.020 --> 30:53.340
 like just take me through it.

30:53.340 --> 30:57.220
 Cause we're talking about being outnumbered in a fight,

30:57.220 --> 30:58.180
 just being beat up.

30:58.180 --> 30:59.020
 Very similar.

31:00.260 --> 31:02.740
 By the way, this is like a no eye contact off.

31:02.740 --> 31:05.540
 Yeah, we're both uncomfortable with it.

31:05.540 --> 31:06.740
 Yeah, it's great.

31:06.740 --> 31:10.180
 It's kind of nice to be with my people, but yeah.

31:10.180 --> 31:12.420
 Do you need a sheet of paper to look at it?

31:12.420 --> 31:15.980
 I'm going, I got a good sweet spot right there.

31:15.980 --> 31:18.860
 Yeah, it's a nightmare, but it's part of it.

31:21.740 --> 31:24.280
 It's the validation too is the worst part.

31:24.280 --> 31:27.200
 Cause you know, whenever you do comedy and kill,

31:27.200 --> 31:28.200
 you can be a great comic,

31:28.200 --> 31:29.940
 but even David Tell, these brilliant guys,

31:29.940 --> 31:30.780
 they feel like they're getting,

31:30.780 --> 31:32.180
 you feel like you're getting away with something.

31:32.180 --> 31:33.140
 I don't have a day job.

31:33.140 --> 31:34.300
 I'm telling jokes for a living.

31:34.300 --> 31:35.540
 I'm talking about my dick up here

31:35.540 --> 31:36.580
 and they're fucking loving me.

31:36.580 --> 31:38.460
 And they call me a genius and all this.

31:38.460 --> 31:40.640
 I'm talking about my sack, you know?

31:40.640 --> 31:42.020
 And it's great.

31:42.020 --> 31:43.340
 It makes people happy and it's funny,

31:43.340 --> 31:46.780
 but that bombing, when you bomb,

31:46.780 --> 31:48.820
 your first thought is like, yeah, you're right.

31:48.820 --> 31:50.820
 At first you're like, fuck you guys.

31:50.820 --> 31:51.780
 What, you don't like this shit?

31:51.780 --> 31:53.020
 And then you just start going in.

31:53.020 --> 31:54.940
 You're like, man, maybe it isn't that good.

31:54.940 --> 31:55.780
 Maybe they're right.

31:55.780 --> 31:56.700
 I do suck.

31:56.700 --> 31:57.860
 I knew I sucked.

31:57.860 --> 32:00.100
 I should become a mailman, you know?

32:00.100 --> 32:03.580
 And it stinks and you feel alone.

32:03.580 --> 32:06.180
 And you feel like you wasted their time.

32:06.180 --> 32:07.460
 And then you're like, what was I thinking?

32:07.460 --> 32:08.380
 I could be a comedian.

32:08.380 --> 32:09.460
 What the fuck, who am I?

32:09.460 --> 32:11.740
 You know, Eddie Murphy, what am I doing here?

32:11.740 --> 32:16.340
 So it's a lot of just spiraling out of horrible thoughts.

32:16.340 --> 32:18.580
 But I also love that it hurts so bad.

32:18.580 --> 32:23.260
 Bombing fucking hurts because now everybody doesn't do it.

32:23.260 --> 32:25.220
 I think a lot more people could do comedy probably

32:25.220 --> 32:26.460
 and figure it out.

32:26.460 --> 32:28.600
 But the bombing is so brutal

32:28.600 --> 32:31.460
 that it keeps, one time I went to Minneapolis.

32:31.460 --> 32:32.580
 I was like, this is a great city.

32:32.580 --> 32:33.820
 I mean, it's a sun is shining.

32:33.820 --> 32:35.460
 Why isn't this city like packed?

32:35.460 --> 32:36.920
 And they're like, cause the winters are so bad

32:36.920 --> 32:38.680
 and we love it because it keeps everybody out.

32:38.680 --> 32:39.820
 And I feel like the same about comedy.

32:39.820 --> 32:41.820
 The bombs are so brutal.

32:41.820 --> 32:43.320
 I've had bombs where I'm in bed.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.760
 I'm just staring at the ceiling like, what the fuck was that?

32:45.760 --> 32:47.400
 Like you have PTSD.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.960
 I bombed at an arena once, 20,000 people.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.460
 I did 30 minutes to silence.

32:52.460 --> 32:53.300
 I guess.

32:53.300 --> 32:54.780
 So it's not just like one joke fails.

32:54.780 --> 32:58.580
 It's like they start piling on like it's irrecoverable.

32:58.580 --> 32:59.420
 Yes.

32:59.420 --> 33:00.980
 And one joke failing is very common.

33:00.980 --> 33:03.860
 Like a lot of audience don't even notice like that bomb.

33:03.860 --> 33:05.540
 Cause you get, you know, you've got so many jokes in a row.

33:05.540 --> 33:07.140
 You can sandwich a good one, then a bad one,

33:07.140 --> 33:08.140
 then a good one.

33:08.140 --> 33:10.460
 But when you bomb, it's almost like they chose,

33:10.460 --> 33:12.160
 we don't like you.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.500
 Nothing you say will redeem yourself.

33:14.500 --> 33:16.780
 And it's hard to get out of.

33:16.780 --> 33:18.300
 It's like being pulled down by your hair.

33:18.300 --> 33:19.420
 You can't get back.

33:19.420 --> 33:21.940
 I can't win this fight no matter what.

33:21.940 --> 33:24.620
 Can you like get them back by acknowledging

33:24.620 --> 33:27.060
 like the elephant in the room that like.

33:27.060 --> 33:28.540
 That helps, but they're still gonna go,

33:28.540 --> 33:31.380
 that was funny when he made fun of it, but he sucks.

33:31.380 --> 33:32.220
 He still sucks.

33:32.220 --> 33:33.420
 He still sucks.

33:33.420 --> 33:34.360
 That's the worst part.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.140
 You're going, no, this is good.

33:36.140 --> 33:37.220
 You guys just don't like me.

33:37.220 --> 33:39.540
 Just cause you don't like me doesn't mean I'm bad.

33:39.540 --> 33:41.740
 Yeah, I like going to open mics a lot.

33:41.740 --> 33:45.540
 Just listening because first of all,

33:45.540 --> 33:47.180
 I think the audience in open mic,

33:47.180 --> 33:49.460
 at least the ones I've been to,

33:49.460 --> 33:51.900
 is mostly I guess other comedians

33:51.900 --> 33:53.540
 or like at least people who don't seem

33:53.540 --> 33:55.300
 to want to laugh at anything.

33:55.300 --> 33:58.700
 And so I just love it because it's human nature

33:58.700 --> 34:00.540
 and perseverance that is best.

34:00.540 --> 34:02.820
 That here's comedians, like clearly,

34:03.660 --> 34:04.860
 this is mostly in Austin.

34:04.860 --> 34:06.140
 They have a dream.

34:06.140 --> 34:07.820
 Like why would you get up there?

34:07.820 --> 34:12.020
 Right, maybe some weird, you know,

34:12.020 --> 34:13.900
 New Year's resolution bullshit,

34:13.900 --> 34:16.300
 but for the most part, it's people who want to be comedians.

34:16.300 --> 34:18.580
 Like a lot of the open micers are people

34:18.580 --> 34:21.180
 who clearly have done this for quite a long time already.

34:21.180 --> 34:24.500
 Like at least a year or two, maybe five years.

34:24.500 --> 34:28.080
 And they're often not very funny.

34:29.160 --> 34:34.160
 And just bombing in front of an audience of like 20

34:36.700 --> 34:39.120
 where they're just sitting there,

34:39.120 --> 34:42.460
 like almost like mocking them with their eyes

34:42.460 --> 34:45.960
 or maybe, and I don't know, and they still push through.

34:45.960 --> 34:49.380
 They still like, as if they're doing an arena

34:49.380 --> 34:50.700
 and everybody's laughing.

34:52.020 --> 34:54.260
 They still got that energy trying.

34:54.260 --> 34:58.160
 Almost like to an audience that doesn't exist.

34:58.160 --> 35:00.000
 Like an audience of their dreams.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.900
 Cause I guess that you have to do that

35:01.900 --> 35:03.740
 to keep the energy of the act going.

35:03.740 --> 35:07.040
 And it's just so beautiful to watch them try it.

35:08.300 --> 35:11.380
 And also what happens, open mic,

35:11.380 --> 35:13.840
 I don't know, five minutes, whatever they do,

35:13.840 --> 35:18.840
 they walk off and then walk back off stage.

35:19.180 --> 35:21.860
 And like, you can't, who do they look at?

35:21.860 --> 35:24.380
 Like what do you look at, do you make eye contact

35:24.380 --> 35:25.700
 with people, do you?

35:25.700 --> 35:27.340
 You look at your phone, you look at your feet,

35:27.340 --> 35:28.660
 you just zone out.

35:28.660 --> 35:32.380
 You kind of kind of go white, you know,

35:32.380 --> 35:34.440
 you just hear white noise and go out.

35:34.440 --> 35:37.260
 It's tough, but you got it.

35:37.260 --> 35:40.400
 You need a little delusion to be a comedian.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.340
 To get into it, it takes a little bit of delusion.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.560
 Like you think you can do this, you know,

35:44.560 --> 35:46.980
 you got 10 years ahead of you of hell

35:46.980 --> 35:48.660
 and you're up for this.

35:48.660 --> 35:50.980
 And you know, most comics, we see a horrible crowd

35:50.980 --> 35:53.280
 and we see our friend bomb and we go,

35:53.280 --> 35:55.040
 yeah, he's bombing, but I'll get him.

35:55.040 --> 35:56.460
 I'll get him.

35:56.460 --> 36:01.460
 And then you don't get him, but that's human nature too.

36:02.100 --> 36:04.420
 It's like, they don't like him, but they'll like me.

36:04.420 --> 36:07.180
 And you need a little of that to keep going as a comedian.

36:07.180 --> 36:08.340
 But you don't want too much delusion

36:08.340 --> 36:11.980
 because then you're a psycho, but you need a little.

36:11.980 --> 36:13.980
 Well, the psycho could be good for a comedy.

36:13.980 --> 36:15.740
 That's true too, love psychos.

36:15.740 --> 36:18.740
 I mentioned to you offline that I talked to Elon

36:18.740 --> 36:20.380
 and we talked about doing standup,

36:20.380 --> 36:22.940
 but he's thinking maybe do a few minutes of standup.

36:22.940 --> 36:25.640
 I was gonna say, if you need a coach, Elon, I gotcha.

36:27.300 --> 36:28.660
 Well, maybe you should move to Austin

36:28.660 --> 36:30.140
 to coach him full time.

36:30.140 --> 36:32.140
 Ah, hopefully he can fly me in.

36:32.140 --> 36:36.220
 So what advice would you give to somebody

36:36.220 --> 36:39.200
 who wants to try to do five minutes,

36:39.200 --> 36:44.200
 like the early steps of trying to go to an open mic

36:44.980 --> 36:46.500
 and say something funny?

36:46.500 --> 36:48.480
 Well, that's the irony of comedy is,

36:48.480 --> 36:49.320
 I don't know if it's irony,

36:49.320 --> 36:51.740
 but it's like the beginning is the hardest part.

36:51.740 --> 36:53.380
 Usually the beginning is easy part.

36:53.380 --> 36:55.300
 Hey, I'm playing this level of Mario.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.820
 I start, I jump over one Koopa Troopa, whatever.

36:57.820 --> 36:59.620
 And then the end is like, Jesus Christ,

36:59.620 --> 37:01.180
 I got 30 guys coming at me.

37:01.180 --> 37:02.140
 Comedy is the opposite.

37:02.140 --> 37:04.980
 The beginning is like, it's a gauntlet.

37:04.980 --> 37:06.220
 It's just obstacles.

37:06.220 --> 37:07.940
 And it's like you said, open mics.

37:07.940 --> 37:10.740
 I watched these famous comedians on Netflix and you go,

37:10.740 --> 37:12.100
 this would all bomb at an open mic.

37:12.100 --> 37:14.220
 They're killing in Radio City.

37:14.220 --> 37:15.340
 This would bomb at an open mic.

37:15.340 --> 37:16.300
 That's the weird part.

37:16.300 --> 37:18.020
 So it's almost like you have to go through hell

37:18.020 --> 37:21.340
 just to get to the promised land.

37:21.340 --> 37:25.260
 And I would say, rehearse the shit out of it

37:25.260 --> 37:26.820
 because you're gonna get frazzled up there.

37:26.820 --> 37:28.540
 Everybody thinks, oh, this is good material.

37:28.540 --> 37:31.260
 But you also forget about the other part of delivering it,

37:31.260 --> 37:33.900
 having confidence, being likable,

37:33.900 --> 37:35.980
 having timing, having a cadence,

37:35.980 --> 37:37.100
 figuring out who you are,

37:37.100 --> 37:39.300
 figuring out what the audience thinks you are

37:39.300 --> 37:40.820
 or how they perceive you.

37:40.820 --> 37:42.160
 Cause you can go up there and say all this,

37:42.160 --> 37:44.380
 but they go, why is the guy, he's clearly gay.

37:44.380 --> 37:46.100
 Why is he acting like he's not gay?

37:46.100 --> 37:47.820
 That's all, now they're not listening to the joke.

37:47.820 --> 37:50.380
 So like, you gotta know how you look.

37:50.380 --> 37:53.200
 And it's just repetition, repetition.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.980
 And bombing is not failure.

37:54.980 --> 37:56.140
 That's what you gotta remember.

37:56.140 --> 37:58.620
 I mean, look, if you do a killer hour

37:58.620 --> 38:01.180
 and then you take it to Netflix and bomb, you fucked up.

38:01.180 --> 38:03.080
 But bombing is not failure.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.840
 It's just data.

38:04.840 --> 38:07.700
 It's going, oh, okay, I gotta retool that.

38:07.700 --> 38:08.540
 That didn't work.

38:08.540 --> 38:09.820
 Something's wrong there.

38:09.820 --> 38:11.180
 I missed a word there.

38:11.180 --> 38:13.180
 So you gotta treat the act

38:13.180 --> 38:18.180
 almost like ingredients in a cooking, in a dish.

38:20.100 --> 38:22.100
 You know, like, oh, I put too many eggs in.

38:22.100 --> 38:22.940
 Take an egg out.

38:22.940 --> 38:24.360
 You gotta treat it like that.

38:24.360 --> 38:26.540
 And look, when you pull a bad cake out of an oven,

38:26.540 --> 38:27.860
 you go, I fucked up.

38:27.860 --> 38:29.540
 But it doesn't hurt your feelings.

38:29.540 --> 38:32.420
 But when you bomb and fuck up, it hurts your feelings.

38:32.420 --> 38:33.620
 So you gotta factor that in too.

38:33.620 --> 38:35.060
 Your feelings gonna be hurt

38:35.060 --> 38:36.880
 and just almost be a robot

38:36.880 --> 38:39.260
 and just keep going towards that open mic.

38:39.260 --> 38:40.860
 You know how scary an open mic is?

38:40.860 --> 38:43.500
 Bombing sucks, but bombing in front of other comedians

38:43.500 --> 38:44.660
 is way worse.

38:44.660 --> 38:47.100
 Cause they know what just happened

38:47.100 --> 38:49.460
 and they could have saved you and they didn't.

38:49.460 --> 38:51.180
 So it's way worse.

38:51.180 --> 38:53.980
 And they're gonna be your quote unquote friends

38:55.260 --> 38:56.140
 for this journey.

38:56.140 --> 38:57.820
 Yeah, no, these are evil people.

38:59.020 --> 39:02.820
 Twisted, fucked up, hurt people.

39:02.820 --> 39:05.260
 Can you tell, like in those early days,

39:05.260 --> 39:06.420
 let's just talk about that,

39:06.420 --> 39:08.060
 like at the open mic level

39:08.060 --> 39:11.180
 that a joke is gonna be good on paper.

39:11.180 --> 39:12.660
 Like I'll give you my experience

39:12.660 --> 39:16.560
 cause maybe you could be my coach

39:16.560 --> 39:18.140
 in this particular moment.

39:18.140 --> 39:18.980
 So.

39:18.980 --> 39:19.980
 Like Larry Nassar.

39:22.980 --> 39:24.380
 That's fun, huh?

39:24.380 --> 39:25.220
 Joking, everybody.

39:25.220 --> 39:26.840
 I hope nobody takes it seriously.

39:28.180 --> 39:30.940
 I now have an amazing team of folks

39:30.940 --> 39:31.940
 who help me with editing

39:31.940 --> 39:33.700
 and they're now currently sweating.

39:33.700 --> 39:34.540
 Watch this.

39:34.540 --> 39:35.360
 We gotta leave that one in.

39:35.360 --> 39:36.200
 That was quick.

39:36.200 --> 39:37.020
 Yeah, that was pretty good.

39:37.020 --> 39:37.860
 I'll leave that one.

39:37.860 --> 39:38.700
 That was good.

39:38.700 --> 39:40.860
 All right.

39:40.860 --> 39:45.100
 So going in front of an audience,

39:45.100 --> 39:48.180
 just even to give a lecture terrifies me,

39:48.180 --> 39:49.940
 which I've done.

39:49.940 --> 39:53.260
 But open mic, I mean, that to me,

39:53.260 --> 39:55.600
 perhaps that's why I like going to open mics and listening

39:55.600 --> 39:58.940
 is cause I just, it terrifies me so much,

39:58.940 --> 40:02.620
 that idea of going up there and bombing.

40:02.620 --> 40:03.720
 I mean, it's scary.

40:03.720 --> 40:07.220
 And to do even like one minute, to be honest, is scary.

40:07.220 --> 40:11.180
 And five minutes, I'm also watched enough open mics

40:11.180 --> 40:13.060
 to realize that five minutes is a long time.

40:13.060 --> 40:15.300
 I mean, it depends on your comedy,

40:15.300 --> 40:18.800
 but if you're doing fast stuff,

40:18.800 --> 40:20.500
 five minutes is a really long time.

40:20.500 --> 40:22.420
 Oh, it's eternity.

40:22.420 --> 40:26.300
 I guess with a long story, too, is a long time

40:26.300 --> 40:27.840
 because if the story's not working,

40:27.840 --> 40:29.020
 you're building up to something.

40:29.020 --> 40:30.980
 If the story's gonna fail,

40:30.980 --> 40:33.420
 you just spent all that time telling the story

40:33.420 --> 40:35.500
 that completely went flat.

40:35.500 --> 40:36.560
 Completely. Got nothing.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.160
 I guess if you have a series of jokes,

40:38.160 --> 40:39.700
 you can at least try to recover

40:39.700 --> 40:41.340
 and like do the Mitch Hedberg thing

40:41.340 --> 40:43.020
 where like, all right, I'll cross that off.

40:43.020 --> 40:43.980
 Yeah, yeah.

40:45.260 --> 40:48.780
 Well, I'm able to, like I've tried to write a few things

40:48.780 --> 40:51.700
 and I'm able to tell that it's really bad.

40:51.700 --> 40:54.380
 Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, well, that's better than most.

40:54.380 --> 40:56.860
 Most people's egos kick in, they go, no, this is good.

40:56.860 --> 40:59.180
 No, see, I'm able to introspect that.

40:59.180 --> 41:00.620
 Like it seems funny.

41:00.620 --> 41:03.460
 I mean, I guess the thing I'm looking for is original.

41:03.460 --> 41:08.340
 Like there's easy stuff that you think is funny,

41:08.340 --> 41:10.860
 but to me, originality is the thing

41:10.860 --> 41:12.860
 you should be looking for because then,

41:12.860 --> 41:17.180
 because then that's what's actually becomes funny.

41:17.180 --> 41:21.740
 Like, or rather, if it's original,

41:21.740 --> 41:25.320
 even if it bombs, that feels like more

41:25.320 --> 41:27.820
 a beautiful art creation that you did.

41:27.820 --> 41:29.720
 Like at least you swung for it.

41:29.720 --> 41:30.980
 Like you did something unique.

41:30.980 --> 41:33.860
 Cause like even with open mic, your first five minutes,

41:33.860 --> 41:36.380
 there's so many, just go to enough open mics,

41:36.380 --> 41:39.420
 you'll hear like all the, there's like a list of jokes

41:39.420 --> 41:40.580
 that you can just go to.

41:40.580 --> 41:42.240
 First of all, you can make fun of the fact

41:42.240 --> 41:45.140
 that you're at open mic, that you're like doing this

41:45.140 --> 41:46.840
 for the first time and so on.

41:46.840 --> 41:49.100
 You could do a lot of stuff where you make fun

41:49.100 --> 41:51.580
 of your appearance in some way and so on.

41:51.580 --> 41:53.520
 But like, yeah, you could do that.

41:53.520 --> 41:56.620
 You know, that takes actually, that's way harder

41:56.620 --> 41:59.420
 than people realize to do it in an original way.

41:59.420 --> 42:00.260
 Yes.

42:00.260 --> 42:05.180
 You have to present who you are as a person very quickly,

42:05.180 --> 42:07.900
 enough to then put that person down

42:07.900 --> 42:09.620
 in front of everybody else.

42:09.620 --> 42:11.540
 So you have to reveal the.

42:11.540 --> 42:12.380
 The audience is like that,

42:12.380 --> 42:13.840
 cause they go, he knows what we're thinking.

42:13.840 --> 42:15.660
 Yeah, exactly.

42:15.660 --> 42:17.340
 But do it again in an original way.

42:17.340 --> 42:19.940
 And so like when I'm trying to write stuff,

42:19.940 --> 42:23.820
 when I, not that I've tried long, it's like 30 minutes,

42:23.820 --> 42:27.460
 but as enough to see like, oh shit,

42:27.460 --> 42:29.980
 to write something original is really difficult.

42:29.980 --> 42:32.300
 It is, but do you got a bit, anything?

42:32.300 --> 42:33.140
 No.

42:33.140 --> 42:34.580
 You didn't write any one line or anything?

42:34.580 --> 42:35.400
 For this?

42:35.400 --> 42:36.240
 No.

42:36.240 --> 42:37.360
 Well, just in general, ever in your life,

42:37.360 --> 42:38.200
 ever written a joke?

42:38.200 --> 42:39.300
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:39.300 --> 42:40.140
 Oh, okay.

42:40.140 --> 42:42.300
 No, but I don't have anything in my mind popped up.

42:42.300 --> 42:47.300
 So the jokes that I've written have more,

42:47.460 --> 42:50.860
 like for some reason my mind goes to like dark places.

42:50.860 --> 42:55.600
 So, you know, like, and not actually dark

42:55.600 --> 42:59.980
 in the Mark Norman dark, because you go really dark

42:59.980 --> 43:01.740
 to where it's like almost absurd.

43:01.740 --> 43:02.580
 Yes.

43:02.580 --> 43:05.900
 My natural inclination is to go to like

43:05.900 --> 43:10.900
 a dark historical like place, like Hitler and Stalin.

43:11.020 --> 43:12.300
 Yeah.

43:12.300 --> 43:15.840
 And almost, so go to that place

43:15.840 --> 43:20.840
 and then talk about something absurd there.

43:20.840 --> 43:25.840
 So like, don't go like all the way, I don't know.

43:27.100 --> 43:29.860
 I don't want to give examples because it'd be clipped,

43:29.860 --> 43:33.300
 but the Mark Norman style, look it up.

43:33.300 --> 43:37.020
 He has a special on his YouTube, that kind.

43:37.020 --> 43:39.340
 I want to almost explore the dark aspects

43:39.340 --> 43:42.700
 of human nature more kind of connected

43:42.700 --> 43:44.220
 to actual historical figures.

43:44.220 --> 43:47.180
 That's the inclination.

43:47.180 --> 43:48.900
 Like, I don't know, Nature's Metal,

43:48.900 --> 43:51.500
 the Instagram channel that explores

43:51.500 --> 43:55.420
 like the darkness of nature, like something there.

43:55.420 --> 43:57.140
 See, that's good that you already know

43:57.140 --> 43:59.180
 that you've kind of gotten to the core

43:59.180 --> 44:00.420
 of your comedy already.

44:00.420 --> 44:03.480
 And that's interesting, that's a step ahead.

44:03.480 --> 44:05.860
 Yeah, I can hear, with most things that I do in life,

44:05.860 --> 44:08.160
 I can like hear the music from a distance,

44:08.160 --> 44:12.060
 like in myself, like, okay, if you have anything,

44:12.060 --> 44:13.900
 this is the direction it'll be

44:13.900 --> 44:16.220
 without actually knowing exactly all the steps.

44:16.220 --> 44:18.140
 And that's a nice motivation to be like, all right,

44:18.140 --> 44:19.860
 well, if you do this for a long time,

44:19.860 --> 44:21.660
 maybe you'll have a chance to get there.

44:21.660 --> 44:22.500
 Right.

44:22.500 --> 44:25.220
 But you have to, that's where it's a feature

44:25.220 --> 44:27.180
 to be super self critical, I think.

44:27.180 --> 44:28.020
 Yes.

44:28.020 --> 44:30.220
 But then that's why it's fucking terrifying

44:30.220 --> 44:33.180
 to walk up to a stage, stand there,

44:33.180 --> 44:34.700
 and probably forget everything.

44:34.700 --> 44:36.480
 Yeah, that's the other part nobody thinks about.

44:36.480 --> 44:37.900
 Just goes right out of your head.

44:37.900 --> 44:39.820
 You go fight or flight, it's ugly.

44:39.820 --> 44:43.740
 My first years were horrific bombing, horrific stammering,

44:43.740 --> 44:45.500
 horrific not remembering the punchline.

44:45.500 --> 44:48.040
 Like, you got to, maybe you got a set up going

44:48.040 --> 44:49.260
 and they're kind of on board and you're like,

44:49.260 --> 44:51.980
 ah, how's that, ah, camera, camera out it goes.

44:51.980 --> 44:55.500
 And you just hate yourself, it's a nightmare.

44:55.500 --> 44:57.020
 But you've already kind of,

44:57.020 --> 44:58.620
 maybe if you haven't done standup or whatever,

44:58.620 --> 45:02.780
 but you kind of know your voice and that's pretty advanced.

45:02.780 --> 45:05.020
 So you're not trying to be somebody else, I guess.

45:05.020 --> 45:07.600
 Yeah, just for having done like podcasts

45:07.600 --> 45:09.140
 and lecture and so on.

45:09.140 --> 45:09.980
 That helps.

45:09.980 --> 45:12.700
 I've embarrassed, I've already done some of the work

45:12.700 --> 45:15.140
 of the standups do, which is embarrass yourself

45:15.140 --> 45:17.420
 in front of others for prolonged periods of time.

45:17.420 --> 45:18.260
 Yes.

45:18.260 --> 45:21.660
 Yeah, so I've done that without actually developing

45:21.660 --> 45:22.500
 the funny.

45:22.500 --> 45:23.580
 Right, right, right.

45:23.580 --> 45:27.860
 But maybe the funny just is not that difficult to develop.

45:28.820 --> 45:30.180
 No, it's super difficult, of course,

45:30.180 --> 45:32.060
 but I mean, maybe the essential work

45:32.060 --> 45:34.420
 of a standup comedian is just the embarrassment

45:34.420 --> 45:36.120
 of like finding who you are.

45:36.120 --> 45:37.780
 Yeah, that's a part of it for sure.

45:37.780 --> 45:39.220
 You know, in the beginning you're like,

45:39.220 --> 45:41.140
 water bottle, what's funny about water bottle?

45:41.140 --> 45:42.580
 Hmm, I'm a funny guy, I can make this funny,

45:42.580 --> 45:44.380
 but that ain't, that's not it, you know?

45:44.380 --> 45:47.100
 It's your shit, your shit, like your dark stuff.

45:47.100 --> 45:50.180
 For me, I tend to gravitate towards dark,

45:50.180 --> 45:52.300
 but in a weird way where, you know,

45:52.300 --> 45:54.660
 people will say like, hey, don't objectify women.

45:54.660 --> 45:57.540
 But then they go, Caitlyn Jenner's beautiful.

45:57.540 --> 46:00.900
 And you're like, well, wait, I know something's off here.

46:00.900 --> 46:05.560
 Why can you objectify her, but not the supermodel?

46:05.560 --> 46:06.760
 So what's going on there?

46:06.760 --> 46:08.540
 And I like to play with that.

46:08.540 --> 46:12.660
 So I have this joke where I say, Caitlyn Jenner,

46:12.660 --> 46:15.220
 oh, women go, Caitlyn Jenner's beautiful, beautiful woman.

46:15.220 --> 46:17.900
 I go, well, you look like her, and they go, fuck you.

46:17.900 --> 46:20.200
 And you're like, there's a lot of truth there.

46:20.200 --> 46:23.060
 But I like exploring that kind of,

46:23.060 --> 46:24.620
 oh, you're trying to get one over on me,

46:24.620 --> 46:27.180
 or you're lying to yourself, or what are we doing here?

46:27.180 --> 46:29.020
 And I like that kind of comedy.

46:30.260 --> 46:31.660
 I don't see color, well, I'm black.

46:31.660 --> 46:32.500
 No, you're not.

46:32.500 --> 46:36.060
 Ah, you know, that's fun, because you're lying.

46:37.820 --> 46:42.320
 Yeah, okay, so like big time comedians such as yourself

46:42.320 --> 46:45.100
 don't like to think of yourself in this way, but.

46:45.100 --> 46:45.940
 There we go.

46:45.940 --> 46:50.700
 Yeah, this is like where you over philosophize comedy, but.

46:50.700 --> 46:51.700
 Yeah, definitely.

46:51.700 --> 46:55.300
 It seems like comedians.

46:55.300 --> 46:56.140
 Don't say important.

46:56.140 --> 46:58.060
 Nothing worse than a comedian who thinks they're important.

46:58.060 --> 47:00.220
 Yeah, so I was going, I was trying to find,

47:00.220 --> 47:01.980
 as I was trying to say these words,

47:01.980 --> 47:06.420
 I realized how cliche it is and how uninteresting it is.

47:06.420 --> 47:09.620
 So I'm going to just, but there is something.

47:09.620 --> 47:10.940
 I'm worried this whole thing is uninteresting.

47:10.940 --> 47:12.260
 I'm like, who cares about comedy?

47:12.260 --> 47:13.900
 There's like six comics on the planet.

47:13.900 --> 47:15.020
 That nobody cares.

47:15.020 --> 47:17.900
 Okay, I trust you in the pilot seat.

47:17.900 --> 47:18.740
 You know what you're doing.

47:18.740 --> 47:20.820
 You got listeners.

47:20.820 --> 47:22.300
 They've tuned out long ago.

47:22.300 --> 47:24.660
 Oh, you got Dan Carlin on here, huh?

47:24.660 --> 47:25.620
 Is he around?

47:25.620 --> 47:28.500
 Yeah, we're just going back and forth on Twitter just now.

47:28.500 --> 47:29.500
 He's a huge fan.

47:29.500 --> 47:30.540
 He was on here before.

47:30.540 --> 47:31.740
 He'll be back.

47:31.740 --> 47:35.860
 I've been actually really trying to volunteer myself

47:35.860 --> 47:40.340
 aggressively with Dan Carlin for like a Russian episode

47:40.340 --> 47:42.060
 where I can speak Russian.

47:42.060 --> 47:44.140
 There's certain documents.

47:44.140 --> 47:46.020
 I talked with Jaco about this too.

47:46.020 --> 47:49.820
 Certain things, I mean, I just love the challenge

47:49.820 --> 47:52.780
 of bringing Russian documents that I can read in Russian

47:52.780 --> 47:55.740
 and then can translate and can try to capture

47:55.740 --> 48:00.740
 the depth of the writing in the Russian language

48:01.820 --> 48:03.620
 and communicate to the American audience.

48:03.620 --> 48:05.020
 So much is lost in translation.

48:05.020 --> 48:09.260
 Like there's so much pain and poetry in the Russian language.

48:09.260 --> 48:10.860
 It's just connected to the culture.

48:10.860 --> 48:13.020
 Every language, not every language,

48:13.020 --> 48:18.020
 but many languages are uniquely able to capture

48:18.260 --> 48:19.580
 the culture of the people.

48:19.580 --> 48:21.460
 I mean, in some way they're the representation

48:21.460 --> 48:23.140
 of the culture of the people.

48:23.140 --> 48:24.780
 And so Russian is definitely that,

48:24.780 --> 48:26.940
 like represents the full history and culture

48:26.940 --> 48:28.860
 of the 20th century with all the atrocities,

48:28.860 --> 48:32.140
 all the broken promises, all those kinds of things.

48:32.140 --> 48:35.300
 Norm says Russian literature is,

48:35.300 --> 48:38.340
 it's the most tapped into human existence than anything else.

48:39.420 --> 48:40.260
 Norm.

48:40.260 --> 48:41.100
 McDonald.

48:41.100 --> 48:41.940
 Yeah.

48:41.940 --> 48:43.100
 The Russian literature guy.

48:43.100 --> 48:44.600
 Dostoevsky, all that shit.

48:46.140 --> 48:48.220
 It's funny that there is a gap with comedians too.

48:48.220 --> 48:50.260
 There's a culture of Russian comedy,

48:50.260 --> 48:52.180
 like standup comedians that are totally.

48:52.180 --> 48:53.180
 Is that right?

48:53.180 --> 48:54.020
 Yeah, yeah.

48:54.020 --> 48:55.540
 I don't know these Russians.

48:55.540 --> 48:57.260
 I mean, I don't know today.

48:57.260 --> 49:00.940
 I mean, more from the 80s and 90s and there's a.

49:00.940 --> 49:01.780
 Yakov.

49:02.700 --> 49:03.940
 That's all I know.

49:03.940 --> 49:06.980
 That's not, so there's like a force, that's.

49:06.980 --> 49:08.620
 I've never seen you that offended.

49:08.620 --> 49:09.940
 No, no, no, it's not offended.

49:09.940 --> 49:14.940
 There's a different, there's like the kinesins

49:16.020 --> 49:18.460
 and there's the edgy.

49:18.460 --> 49:19.480
 Is that Russian?

49:20.400 --> 49:21.240
 What do you mean?

49:21.240 --> 49:23.100
 Wait, I thought you said there was Russian comics.

49:23.100 --> 49:25.260
 Yeah, Russian, I mean, I'm comparing them.

49:25.260 --> 49:29.020
 I'm giving you like a style of darkness,

49:29.020 --> 49:32.320
 like that's the kind of people that kind of challenge.

49:33.860 --> 49:37.820
 They give, again, this is to how important comedians are,

49:37.820 --> 49:42.220
 is they give a voice to people where in the Soviet Union,

49:42.220 --> 49:46.440
 you really can't like express your opposition

49:46.440 --> 49:47.540
 to the government.

49:47.540 --> 49:52.100
 And so comedians are exceptionally important there

49:52.100 --> 49:55.180
 for just, I don't know, channeling the anger,

49:55.180 --> 49:57.260
 even when sometimes it's not the actual opposition

49:57.260 --> 50:00.780
 to the government, they're just channeling the anger,

50:00.780 --> 50:02.940
 the frustration with the absurdity of life.

50:02.940 --> 50:05.800
 Like, you know, when there's a shortage of food,

50:05.800 --> 50:10.460
 shortage of jobs, the absurdity of the bureaucracy,

50:10.460 --> 50:13.560
 like the top heavy government,

50:13.560 --> 50:17.860
 just all of that can only sometimes be expressed

50:17.860 --> 50:20.580
 with like dark, absurd humor.

50:20.580 --> 50:22.900
 And that actually, why there's a culture

50:22.900 --> 50:24.780
 of that kind of humor, you know,

50:24.780 --> 50:27.580
 you gather around the table with vodka

50:27.580 --> 50:31.940
 and all you can do is just talk shit and just.

50:31.940 --> 50:35.100
 Be offensive, say horrible shit, ball bust.

50:35.100 --> 50:36.900
 I mean, I make school shooting jokes

50:36.900 --> 50:37.900
 and people go, how do you do that?

50:37.900 --> 50:39.880
 I'm like, well, maybe that's how I deal with it.

50:39.880 --> 50:40.720
 Yeah.

50:40.720 --> 50:45.580
 You know, like how come I gotta empathize the way you do?

50:45.580 --> 50:46.680
 Maybe we're different.

50:47.860 --> 50:50.860
 All right, so now let's skip the whole open mic thing

50:50.860 --> 50:53.780
 and crafting jokes.

50:53.780 --> 50:55.420
 Oh yeah, that's tough.

50:55.420 --> 50:59.440
 Kerouac said, one day I will find the right words

50:59.440 --> 51:00.820
 and they will be simple.

51:02.140 --> 51:05.020
 When do you know the joke is done, it's perfect.

51:05.020 --> 51:08.580
 You're somebody that does like really sharp,

51:08.580 --> 51:11.820
 like fast jokes.

51:11.820 --> 51:13.300
 Wow. Oh, thanks.

51:13.300 --> 51:15.780
 So like there's somebody, I don't know,

51:15.780 --> 51:18.660
 I don't know who you see yourself in the same school as,

51:18.660 --> 51:23.660
 like you're darker and faster than Hedberg, I think,

51:24.020 --> 51:26.820
 in terms of like, just, I don't know,

51:26.820 --> 51:29.220
 the turns you take are very fast.

51:29.220 --> 51:30.460
 Thanks, I appreciate it.

51:30.460 --> 51:32.300
 I think I got some Norm Macdonald and maybe.

51:32.300 --> 51:33.140
 Oh, Norm, that's right.

51:33.140 --> 51:34.940
 You know, obviously Norm,

51:34.940 --> 51:36.980
 but Chris Rock was huge for me.

51:36.980 --> 51:40.420
 Chris Rock, old like 90s Chris Rock was like,

51:40.420 --> 51:41.860
 I didn't know you could do jokes like that.

51:41.860 --> 51:44.040
 I always loved George Carlin and Groucho Marx

51:44.040 --> 51:47.260
 and Bill Murray, there's so many different types of comedy.

51:47.260 --> 51:50.440
 But when I saw the bigger and blacker bring the pain,

51:50.440 --> 51:54.020
 I was like, oh my God, this is like, it hit me.

51:54.020 --> 51:54.860
 So that was big.

51:54.860 --> 51:57.220
 And then Norm's just like the funniest guy on the planet.

51:57.220 --> 51:59.460
 So him being the smartest guy in the room,

51:59.460 --> 52:01.420
 but acting dumb was great.

52:01.420 --> 52:06.420
 So yeah, Chris Rock has that way of cutting to the bullshit,

52:06.980 --> 52:08.420
 which I mentioned earlier.

52:08.420 --> 52:09.980
 I liked that cutting through the bullshit

52:09.980 --> 52:12.860
 kind of style of comedy, because you kind of go,

52:12.860 --> 52:13.780
 oh, I'm not crazy.

52:13.780 --> 52:15.060
 That's what I thought too.

52:15.060 --> 52:16.740
 I was too scared to say it, but I thought that.

52:16.740 --> 52:19.500
 And he's saying it in a room of people are laughing.

52:19.500 --> 52:21.300
 Maybe I'm not an idiot.

52:21.300 --> 52:22.900
 So that helped me.

52:22.900 --> 52:27.260
 So it's observational, but not Jerry Seinfeld

52:27.260 --> 52:30.500
 observational, it's like going to the darker thing.

52:30.500 --> 52:32.420
 To like within society.

52:32.420 --> 52:34.980
 But I like him too, but seeing it,

52:34.980 --> 52:38.900
 doing it about stuff like in your life, society.

52:38.900 --> 52:42.680
 Yeah, race, gender, government, politics,

52:42.680 --> 52:43.520
 all that kind of stuff.

52:43.520 --> 52:46.300
 Exactly, exactly, sex, human emotions,

52:46.300 --> 52:48.800
 jealousy, whatever it is, that's the good stuff.

52:50.300 --> 52:52.260
 How'd you feel when Norm passed away?

52:52.260 --> 52:57.140
 Ah, that was a bummer because he was, you know what, 61.

52:57.140 --> 53:00.500
 And I just didn't see it coming.

53:00.500 --> 53:04.220
 And I just, I've watched so many hours of his stuff

53:04.220 --> 53:07.020
 and I've met him and he's like,

53:07.020 --> 53:09.300
 he was like this comedic bar, like, hey, we got Norm.

53:09.300 --> 53:10.960
 You know, there's so much shit comedy.

53:10.960 --> 53:13.380
 Then you see Norm and you're like, this is next level.

53:13.380 --> 53:15.500
 This is savant type shit.

53:15.500 --> 53:19.900
 And then to lose him is like, ah, Norm had 20 more years

53:19.900 --> 53:23.160
 at least of just content and content and thoughts

53:23.160 --> 53:24.700
 and his point of view.

53:24.700 --> 53:27.540
 And that's, we'll never get that and that sucks.

53:27.540 --> 53:29.340
 Yeah, there is something about artists

53:29.340 --> 53:32.020
 like Jimi Hendrix dying too early.

53:32.020 --> 53:34.060
 It's like, you wonder.

53:34.060 --> 53:35.020
 What was next?

53:35.020 --> 53:36.180
 Yeah, what was next?

53:36.180 --> 53:39.880
 But then part of it is like, you know,

53:39.880 --> 53:43.260
 it all ends for all of us and it's like walking away early

53:44.220 --> 53:47.860
 is kind of admirable.

53:47.860 --> 53:50.780
 It's almost like I did a pretty good job.

53:50.780 --> 53:51.620
 Yeah.

53:51.620 --> 53:53.780
 I'm good with that.

53:53.780 --> 53:56.580
 And especially the way he did, which is not telling anybody.

53:56.580 --> 53:59.580
 I know, nine years, his best friends didn't even know.

53:59.580 --> 54:01.540
 And in this world of like victimhood

54:01.540 --> 54:03.820
 and I need clicks and I need people to love me,

54:03.820 --> 54:05.660
 he could have, he got, you know, canceled

54:05.660 --> 54:06.700
 and yelled at and in trouble

54:06.700 --> 54:09.060
 and he could have pulled that cancer card and he never did.

54:09.060 --> 54:11.780
 I mean, the integrity on this motherfucker.

54:11.780 --> 54:13.180
 Did you get a chance to interact with him?

54:13.180 --> 54:15.180
 Like what, how often did you meet him?

54:15.180 --> 54:17.600
 I met him once at the Comedy Cellar

54:17.600 --> 54:19.460
 and we chatted for five minutes

54:19.460 --> 54:21.900
 and then he went on and did the Letterman set that he did.

54:21.900 --> 54:23.460
 He was running the Letterman set.

54:23.460 --> 54:26.880
 And sweet guy, nice guy, didn't know him that well,

54:26.880 --> 54:29.000
 but I mean, he's just brilliant.

54:29.000 --> 54:33.140
 And I also love a brilliant guy who does stupid stuff.

54:33.140 --> 54:36.460
 That's a fun, fun little combo there.

54:36.460 --> 54:40.380
 Like silly guys who are actually brilliant also.

54:40.380 --> 54:42.440
 You know, like Louis CK is a brilliant comic

54:42.440 --> 54:45.960
 and he'll do a joke about farting on a kid.

54:45.960 --> 54:46.940
 And you're like, that's great

54:46.940 --> 54:49.560
 that he still finds farts funny

54:49.560 --> 54:52.100
 and he's also this comedic genius guy.

54:52.100 --> 54:53.460
 I like that.

54:53.460 --> 54:55.420
 And doesn't really acknowledge the genius.

54:55.420 --> 54:57.260
 Yeah, yeah.

54:57.260 --> 55:00.740
 Yeah, I like smart people, they're silly.

55:00.740 --> 55:02.860
 Yes, that's a good combo.

55:02.860 --> 55:04.180
 Like you said, Elon is silly.

55:04.180 --> 55:06.100
 Yeah, yeah, super silly. Yeah, that's great.

55:06.100 --> 55:08.380
 Cause we taught, we teach kids like,

55:08.380 --> 55:10.140
 hey, put that down, stop that,

55:10.140 --> 55:12.340
 quit cutting up, quit horsing around.

55:12.340 --> 55:14.980
 But maybe that's some kind of sign of brilliance there.

55:14.980 --> 55:19.760
 Yeah, being like childlike and silly is a kind of wisdom.

55:19.760 --> 55:21.620
 I feel like those people are way wiser

55:21.620 --> 55:23.980
 than the people that, no offense to me,

55:23.980 --> 55:26.940
 wear a suit and take themselves way too seriously.

55:26.940 --> 55:28.540
 No, but you got a spark in you.

55:28.540 --> 55:29.380
 A little bit.

55:29.380 --> 55:31.180
 You got a little, what's the word?

55:31.180 --> 55:34.580
 Not elf, imp.

55:34.580 --> 55:35.680
 Little imp in you.

55:35.680 --> 55:36.520
 Give that a go.

55:36.520 --> 55:38.060
 You know what imp?

55:38.060 --> 55:40.580
 Little mischievous, it's like a little.

55:40.580 --> 55:43.220
 Is that a Tolkien character, imp?

55:43.220 --> 55:44.040
 Yeah, might be.

55:44.040 --> 55:45.940
 An imp is a European mythological being

55:45.940 --> 55:47.580
 similar to a fairy or a demon.

55:47.580 --> 55:49.180
 Are you calling me a fairy?

55:49.180 --> 55:50.820
 Frequently, no, okay.

55:50.820 --> 55:53.780
 Similar to a fairy or a demon.

55:53.780 --> 55:55.220
 I feel like that's a big leap.

55:55.220 --> 55:58.620
 Big leap, yeah, that's not a great info bio there.

55:58.620 --> 56:01.280
 Frequently described in folklore and superstition,

56:01.280 --> 56:04.620
 the word may perhaps derive from the term imps,

56:04.620 --> 56:08.580
 but with a Y, used to denote a young grafted tree.

56:09.860 --> 56:11.100
 It's a little mischievous.

56:11.100 --> 56:12.060
 You got a twinkle.

56:12.060 --> 56:13.820
 You're the serious buttoned up guy,

56:13.820 --> 56:14.940
 but there's a twinkle.

56:14.940 --> 56:16.500
 There's a twinkle.

56:16.500 --> 56:17.900
 And the audience can see the twinkle,

56:17.900 --> 56:21.420
 and that's why you resonate, I think.

56:21.420 --> 56:22.540
 I'm sorry.

56:22.540 --> 56:25.880
 Deep Analysis by Mark Norman, Psychological Analysis.

56:25.880 --> 56:28.860
 Okay, but then back to the crafting of the joke.

56:28.860 --> 56:30.660
 You said Chris Rock and Norm Macdonald.

56:30.660 --> 56:35.380
 What for you, how do you know when the joke is done?

56:35.380 --> 56:37.780
 Are there some jokes that you're proud of?

56:37.780 --> 56:40.960
 Wow, that's well done.

56:40.960 --> 56:43.340
 Yeah, the joke is done.

56:43.340 --> 56:44.300
 It's a tough question

56:44.300 --> 56:45.500
 because there's so many different kinds of jokes.

56:45.500 --> 56:48.340
 There's what we call a chunk, which is a big idea

56:48.340 --> 56:50.140
 with a bunch of jokes in the middle of it,

56:50.140 --> 56:53.180
 and then a big crescendo at the end.

56:53.180 --> 56:54.640
 Or there's a one liner,

56:54.640 --> 56:57.660
 or there's a tag of a joke that's also a joke.

56:57.660 --> 57:01.620
 So the jokes come in different,

57:01.620 --> 57:02.620
 like I have a joke where I say,

57:02.620 --> 57:04.500
 I met my girl in that Jewish app.

57:04.500 --> 57:06.660
 What's that Jewish app called?

57:06.660 --> 57:08.020
 PayPal.

57:08.020 --> 57:08.860
 Nice.

57:08.860 --> 57:11.340
 That's the hell, that's what they're asking you

57:11.340 --> 57:15.540
 to want from the crowd, but it's a fun turn

57:15.540 --> 57:17.100
 because you say your thing

57:17.100 --> 57:18.420
 and then I hit you with a misdirect

57:18.420 --> 57:19.420
 and that's what a joke is.

57:19.420 --> 57:22.820
 A joke is basically me saying something that makes sense,

57:22.820 --> 57:24.500
 but you didn't see it coming.

57:24.500 --> 57:26.200
 And that's a perfect example of that.

57:26.200 --> 57:29.140
 So that joke took forever to figure out, by the way.

57:29.140 --> 57:32.700
 You have to go to different services like PayPal.

57:32.700 --> 57:33.580
 What's funniest?

57:33.580 --> 57:35.820
 Exactly, and I figured PayPal is funny

57:35.820 --> 57:38.060
 because it has the word pay in it.

57:38.060 --> 57:42.060
 Venmo, it's also not really a good word, Venmo, PayPal.

57:42.060 --> 57:43.140
 It just hits better.

57:43.140 --> 57:44.780
 Yeah, PayPal is funnier somehow.

57:44.780 --> 57:45.620
 It's funnier somehow,

57:45.620 --> 57:46.460
 and that's the beauty of comedy.

57:46.460 --> 57:47.920
 There's a weird little magic into it.

57:47.920 --> 57:50.120
 You can get technical all day and formulaic,

57:50.120 --> 57:53.620
 but there's still that little bit of fairy dust

57:53.620 --> 57:55.820
 that you don't know why this is funnier.

57:55.820 --> 57:56.700
 Or imp dust.

57:56.700 --> 57:58.900
 Imp dust, yes.

57:58.900 --> 58:00.880
 With a Y, okay.

58:00.880 --> 58:02.600
 So you know what joke is done when it kills,

58:02.600 --> 58:04.620
 and this is a roundness to a joke

58:04.620 --> 58:06.380
 when you feel like this is buttoned up.

58:06.380 --> 58:07.840
 This is done here.

58:07.840 --> 58:09.960
 Is simplicity the right word there?

58:09.960 --> 58:10.820
 Yeah.

58:10.820 --> 58:12.700
 Is it like you're chopping stuff away

58:12.700 --> 58:13.600
 or are you adding stuff?

58:13.600 --> 58:14.560
 Like what does it feel like?

58:14.560 --> 58:17.220
 Simplicity is always the best angle.

58:17.220 --> 58:19.360
 I mean, you can get real high concept with a joke

58:19.360 --> 58:22.100
 and still make it work, but the simpler the better.

58:22.100 --> 58:24.900
 I saw Dave Chappelle on stage once,

58:24.900 --> 58:28.100
 and Chris Rock and Demetri Martin were in the back

58:28.100 --> 58:30.500
 watching in awe, and Dave Chappelle,

58:30.500 --> 58:31.340
 I can't remember the joke,

58:31.340 --> 58:33.940
 but he said something about sex or women,

58:33.940 --> 58:36.980
 and Demetri Martin goes, eh, it's a little easy.

58:36.980 --> 58:39.360
 And Chris Rock goes, that's why it's good.

58:39.360 --> 58:41.140
 And I remember hearing that as some young comic,

58:41.140 --> 58:44.540
 like ah, I'm getting this comedy lesson right here

58:44.540 --> 58:46.260
 for these two titans.

58:46.260 --> 58:47.700
 And so that was fun.

58:47.700 --> 58:48.980
 Simple is key.

58:48.980 --> 58:50.140
 So the easy is okay.

58:50.140 --> 58:55.060
 That's such a weird, I think I remember reading

58:55.060 --> 58:57.540
 or hearing Eminem say something about

58:57.540 --> 58:58.860
 maybe the song Slim Shade.

58:58.860 --> 59:02.020
 One of the songs, he's like, I knew it was gonna be good

59:02.020 --> 59:05.580
 because it got really repetitive

59:05.580 --> 59:08.060
 and annoying very quickly or something like that.

59:08.060 --> 59:10.500
 I mean, that's the sort of the music equivalent

59:10.500 --> 59:12.900
 of it's too easy.

59:12.900 --> 59:16.100
 Like if it's like super catchy, as a musician,

59:16.100 --> 59:19.740
 you might get very quickly bored of it.

59:19.740 --> 59:23.340
 Or like as you're creating it, no, it's too easy.

59:23.340 --> 59:26.860
 It's like there needs to be some more complexity to it.

59:26.860 --> 59:28.960
 I like complexity, but the best guys

59:28.960 --> 59:33.580
 who are the ones who make complex shit look simple.

59:33.580 --> 59:36.940
 Like you ever heard that Ben Franklin story

59:36.940 --> 59:37.780
 where he's talking to his friend,

59:37.780 --> 59:39.600
 his friend's like, I'm gonna start a hat store.

59:39.600 --> 59:43.660
 So he puts a sign out, says, hats for sale, $12.

59:43.660 --> 59:46.300
 And Ben Franklin looks at it, he goes,

59:46.300 --> 59:47.580
 well, you don't need the $12

59:47.580 --> 59:50.060
 because all they need to know is that you got hats for sale.

59:50.060 --> 59:50.900
 He's like, all right.

59:50.900 --> 59:53.140
 So he loses the $12, makes a new sign, hats for sale.

59:53.140 --> 59:55.740
 And he goes, you don't really need for sale

59:55.740 --> 59:57.060
 because it's a business.

59:57.060 --> 59:58.600
 People can put that together.

59:58.600 --> 59:59.500
 So he just goes, all right.

59:59.500 --> 1:00:01.260
 He makes a new sign, it says hats.

1:00:01.260 --> 1:00:03.740
 And then Ben Franklin's like, you know,

1:00:03.740 --> 1:00:05.360
 you don't really need the word hat.

1:00:05.360 --> 1:00:07.080
 You can just put a picture of a hat.

1:00:07.080 --> 1:00:08.820
 And he made a new sign, which is a picture of a hat

1:00:08.820 --> 1:00:10.420
 and it like helped the business or something.

1:00:10.420 --> 1:00:12.420
 That's like some old wives tale or whatever.

1:00:12.420 --> 1:00:14.940
 But I think about that all the time when I'm writing.

1:00:14.940 --> 1:00:17.280
 I thought this was going to like, there was no sign.

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:19.140
 It went like super like nihilistic.

1:00:19.140 --> 1:00:21.200
 Oh, maybe, maybe, that could work too.

1:00:23.060 --> 1:00:26.620
 What, like as a comedian, so I'm a fan of yours.

1:00:26.620 --> 1:00:29.300
 I enjoy, I really enjoy you in conversations.

1:00:29.300 --> 1:00:30.140
 Wow.

1:00:30.140 --> 1:00:31.940
 Now I'm getting nothing out of it.

1:00:31.940 --> 1:00:35.020
 This is like emotion.

1:00:35.020 --> 1:00:36.540
 You're tough not to read.

1:00:36.540 --> 1:00:37.680
 Cold inside.

1:00:38.820 --> 1:00:40.820
 I mean, just the quickness you have,

1:00:40.820 --> 1:00:43.220
 obviously you're also a great stand up comedian.

1:00:43.220 --> 1:00:46.420
 What's your favorite medium to shine in?

1:00:46.420 --> 1:00:50.100
 So you have a podcast yourself, an excellent podcast.

1:00:51.660 --> 1:00:53.500
 You're often a podcast guest.

1:00:53.500 --> 1:00:55.060
 Yeah.

1:00:55.060 --> 1:00:56.780
 Which is always fun to listen to,

1:00:56.780 --> 1:00:58.540
 how you're going to deal with the different people.

1:00:58.540 --> 1:01:00.260
 You're great on Rogan.

1:01:00.260 --> 1:01:01.100
 Oh, thanks.

1:01:02.300 --> 1:01:04.120
 What do you enjoy most?

1:01:04.120 --> 1:01:07.300
 Podcasts are great because you can stretch out a little more.

1:01:07.300 --> 1:01:08.620
 You can breathe a little.

1:01:08.620 --> 1:01:09.540
 You know, with a stand up set,

1:01:09.540 --> 1:01:11.860
 I like to be like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1:01:11.860 --> 1:01:14.940
 But podcasts are great because it's conversational.

1:01:14.940 --> 1:01:16.820
 So you can be, it's almost like you're being funny

1:01:16.820 --> 1:01:18.140
 with your friends.

1:01:18.140 --> 1:01:20.400
 Whereas a stage is like a, this is a piece.

1:01:20.400 --> 1:01:21.760
 This is a presentation.

1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:25.220
 But I think the podcast is great,

1:01:25.220 --> 1:01:26.980
 but you don't get the reaction.

1:01:26.980 --> 1:01:29.180
 Unless the host is laughing, you can't hear the guy

1:01:29.180 --> 1:01:32.380
 in his car in New Jersey driving to work going, ah!

1:01:32.380 --> 1:01:33.580
 Every now and then I'll read a comment like,

1:01:33.580 --> 1:01:35.140
 I spit out my coffee when you said this.

1:01:35.140 --> 1:01:37.580
 And I'm like, but it's not immediate.

1:01:37.580 --> 1:01:38.400
 You want the immediate.

1:01:38.400 --> 1:01:40.500
 So stand up will always be number one,

1:01:40.500 --> 1:01:44.420
 but there's no better feeling than killing in a room

1:01:44.420 --> 1:01:46.060
 of people who don't know who you are.

1:01:46.060 --> 1:01:48.220
 Strangers, you're in the middle of nowhere.

1:01:48.220 --> 1:01:49.420
 You left your wife at home.

1:01:49.420 --> 1:01:50.540
 You left your kids.

1:01:50.540 --> 1:01:51.740
 You left your house.

1:01:51.740 --> 1:01:54.220
 You're in the middle of bumfucked Dickville

1:01:54.220 --> 1:01:58.740
 and murdering for these hillbilly nobody, whatever it is.

1:01:58.740 --> 1:02:02.060
 And they're slinging their beers and cheering you on.

1:02:02.060 --> 1:02:05.220
 And they carry out and you fuck some fat lady

1:02:05.220 --> 1:02:07.220
 and you leave and you get back to your hotel

1:02:07.220 --> 1:02:09.360
 and you go, holy shit, what was that?

1:02:09.360 --> 1:02:10.580
 No one will ever know about it.

1:02:10.580 --> 1:02:12.620
 Just lost in the ether.

1:02:12.620 --> 1:02:14.420
 That's the best feeling.

1:02:14.420 --> 1:02:15.460
 Yeah.

1:02:15.460 --> 1:02:17.660
 Killing an obscurity as Bill Burr would say.

1:02:19.340 --> 1:02:20.700
 Yeah, this is one of the things that sucks

1:02:20.700 --> 1:02:22.260
 about giving lectures.

1:02:22.260 --> 1:02:27.260
 Like at universities or giving lectures in general

1:02:27.780 --> 1:02:31.980
 is when you look at the audience, you know,

1:02:31.980 --> 1:02:33.860
 several hundred students,

1:02:33.860 --> 1:02:36.140
 they all have a bored look on their face.

1:02:36.140 --> 1:02:36.980
 Yeah, of course.

1:02:36.980 --> 1:02:40.100
 Like my face now probably looks bored,

1:02:40.100 --> 1:02:42.420
 but I'm actually excited to be talking to you.

1:02:42.420 --> 1:02:44.380
 But there's something about just,

1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:46.860
 there's something about a comedy called,

1:02:46.860 --> 1:02:49.000
 maybe this is the contingent of laughter,

1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:51.740
 but like it gives people the freedom to just laugh,

1:02:51.740 --> 1:02:54.140
 to like, to remove that facade of like,

1:02:54.140 --> 1:02:58.100
 you don't have to pretend like you don't care.

1:02:58.100 --> 1:02:59.660
 Like if you care, you can show it

1:02:59.660 --> 1:03:01.580
 and you can have fun with it a lot.

1:03:01.580 --> 1:03:03.780
 Probably liquor helps out too.

1:03:03.780 --> 1:03:05.280
 Yeah, it helps for sure.

1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:06.900
 But there is a, especially,

1:03:06.900 --> 1:03:09.420
 and that's why comedy I think is so popular right now

1:03:09.420 --> 1:03:12.500
 because HR is up our ass.

1:03:12.500 --> 1:03:15.400
 We're scared of old tweets that might come back to haunt us.

1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:17.220
 What did I say on that interview?

1:03:17.220 --> 1:03:18.740
 Even people at offices are like,

1:03:18.740 --> 1:03:22.100
 I put something on Facebook in 1999

1:03:22.100 --> 1:03:24.360
 that was about fat tits that I liked.

1:03:24.360 --> 1:03:25.860
 Should I get rid of that?

1:03:25.860 --> 1:03:28.820
 Even people say like, there's no cancel, whatever.

1:03:28.820 --> 1:03:30.980
 There is something in the air right now

1:03:30.980 --> 1:03:32.420
 that wasn't there before.

1:03:32.420 --> 1:03:34.580
 It's the video, I'm a Karen,

1:03:34.580 --> 1:03:36.620
 I got caught at Trader Joe, whatever it is.

1:03:36.620 --> 1:03:37.860
 People rat on each other now,

1:03:37.860 --> 1:03:40.040
 everybody's tattletaling because they want the clicks.

1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:42.580
 It's a horrible society we've crafted.

1:03:42.580 --> 1:03:46.860
 But standup comedy gets you to come out,

1:03:46.860 --> 1:03:48.700
 and now people do it at standup shows too.

1:03:48.700 --> 1:03:50.300
 Sadly, but it gets you to come out

1:03:50.300 --> 1:03:52.360
 and let that inhibition down.

1:03:52.360 --> 1:03:53.200
 Because we're all human,

1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:55.340
 we've all had the fucked up thoughts like,

1:03:55.340 --> 1:03:56.980
 man, that guy's fat as shit.

1:03:56.980 --> 1:03:57.940
 It doesn't mean you hate the guy,

1:03:57.940 --> 1:03:58.820
 it doesn't mean you hate fat people,

1:03:58.820 --> 1:04:00.220
 it doesn't mean you're fat shaming.

1:04:00.220 --> 1:04:01.520
 But you can't say that at the office.

1:04:01.520 --> 1:04:03.000
 You can't go, Bob, you're fat as shit.

1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:04.920
 You'll get fired for body shaming.

1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:08.180
 But at the club, you go, that guy's fat as shit.

1:04:08.180 --> 1:04:10.940
 The crowd goes, he is fat as shit.

1:04:10.940 --> 1:04:12.140
 And it's this weird cathartic thing

1:04:12.140 --> 1:04:14.140
 because all we do is tamp shit down.

1:04:14.140 --> 1:04:15.340
 It's kind of like you ever meet a girl

1:04:15.340 --> 1:04:17.280
 who's like all prim and proper in the bedroom.

1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:18.780
 She's like, put a lamp up my ass.

1:04:18.780 --> 1:04:20.700
 Ah, you know, whatever it is.

1:04:20.700 --> 1:04:22.900
 It's because we gotta get it out.

1:04:22.900 --> 1:04:24.900
 We're all repressed in some way.

1:04:24.900 --> 1:04:27.660
 So I guess what you're saying is comedy's important.

1:04:27.660 --> 1:04:31.800
 Yes, callback.

1:04:31.800 --> 1:04:32.640
 All right.

1:04:32.640 --> 1:04:33.460
 Well played, sir.

1:04:33.460 --> 1:04:34.300
 Yeah.

1:04:34.300 --> 1:04:35.940
 What do you think about Austin?

1:04:35.940 --> 1:04:37.420
 What do you think about the comedy scene in Austin?

1:04:37.420 --> 1:04:39.780
 We talk about LA and New York.

1:04:39.780 --> 1:04:42.300
 What do you think about what Joe's trying to create there?

1:04:42.300 --> 1:04:46.620
 So I should say that the reason I moved to Austin,

1:04:46.620 --> 1:04:48.980
 I have this dream of, it wouldn't be funny

1:04:48.980 --> 1:04:50.900
 if I said this dream of becoming a comedian.

1:04:50.900 --> 1:04:51.740
 Oh, yeah.

1:04:51.740 --> 1:04:53.940
 It's an audience, at least.

1:04:53.940 --> 1:04:55.220
 Yeah, that's true.

1:04:55.220 --> 1:04:56.380
 You know, I always said you can hear

1:04:56.380 --> 1:04:57.460
 the music in the distance.

1:04:57.460 --> 1:04:59.980
 I have this dream around robotics

1:04:59.980 --> 1:05:01.900
 and artificial intelligence, whether it's a company,

1:05:01.900 --> 1:05:05.220
 whether it's something else that I was just pulling me to.

1:05:05.220 --> 1:05:06.700
 I actually wanted to move to San Francisco,

1:05:06.700 --> 1:05:08.960
 and then all my friends in San Francisco said,

1:05:08.960 --> 1:05:09.900
 no, it's the wrong place.

1:05:09.900 --> 1:05:10.740
 Yeah.

1:05:12.020 --> 1:05:16.180
 At this time, the cynicism there

1:05:16.180 --> 1:05:20.380
 is just not conducive to taking big leaps

1:05:20.380 --> 1:05:23.540
 into the unknown, excited about the future kind of thing.

1:05:23.540 --> 1:05:28.100
 And Austin was that, for me in particular with Elon Musk,

1:05:28.100 --> 1:05:30.500
 but also just the energy that everybody had,

1:05:30.500 --> 1:05:34.540
 including Joe, the excitement about the future.

1:05:34.540 --> 1:05:37.100
 I don't care if Austin burns to the ground

1:05:37.100 --> 1:05:39.000
 and it actually is a complete failure.

1:05:39.880 --> 1:05:42.980
 Being excited about the future seems to be,

1:05:42.980 --> 1:05:44.380
 like optimism about the future,

1:05:44.380 --> 1:05:47.140
 seems to be the thing that actually

1:05:47.140 --> 1:05:49.580
 makes that future happen, makes a great future happen.

1:05:49.580 --> 1:05:53.560
 So it's always cool for me to see Joe

1:05:53.560 --> 1:05:57.860
 super excited about creating a culture in Austin,

1:05:57.860 --> 1:06:01.420
 like making it a comedy hub.

1:06:01.420 --> 1:06:02.700
 I don't want to overstate it,

1:06:02.700 --> 1:06:05.380
 but I think he really believes it'll be

1:06:05.380 --> 1:06:09.260
 a very big place for comedy in the United States

1:06:09.260 --> 1:06:10.500
 and generally in the world.

1:06:10.500 --> 1:06:13.500
 And so just even believing that, that's powerful.

1:06:13.500 --> 1:06:14.340
 I agree.

1:06:14.340 --> 1:06:18.700
 You start to make it happen, that energy is there.

1:06:18.700 --> 1:06:21.220
 Anyway, so, but that's for me from just an outsider

1:06:21.220 --> 1:06:23.000
 watching the fun of it.

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:26.060
 I should also mention for less of an outsider,

1:06:26.060 --> 1:06:29.120
 more insider in the martial arts world,

1:06:29.120 --> 1:06:32.100
 partially probably because of Joe, I'm not sure,

1:06:32.100 --> 1:06:36.220
 like John Donahar, Gordon Ryan, the B Team,

1:06:36.220 --> 1:06:38.700
 all of those folks, those are, that might be gibberish

1:06:38.700 --> 1:06:42.580
 to you, but those are like some of the greatest grapplers

1:06:42.580 --> 1:06:43.820
 in martial artists of all time.

1:06:43.820 --> 1:06:46.900
 So it's also becoming this hub of martial arts.

1:06:46.900 --> 1:06:49.860
 So the whole thing is just beautiful.

1:06:49.860 --> 1:06:52.880
 Anyway, what are your thoughts about that scene?

1:06:52.880 --> 1:06:55.940
 Well, there's a lot here, a lot of things to mention.

1:06:55.940 --> 1:07:00.820
 One, I think Joe did do that to a degree,

1:07:00.820 --> 1:07:03.140
 like all these people, Segura lives there now,

1:07:03.140 --> 1:07:04.500
 a lot of comics live there.

1:07:04.500 --> 1:07:07.580
 He's opening clubs, other clubs are opening.

1:07:07.580 --> 1:07:08.860
 I think it's happening.

1:07:08.860 --> 1:07:10.300
 That's the other thing is people go,

1:07:10.300 --> 1:07:12.420
 everybody's moving to Austin, Austin's the new hub.

1:07:12.420 --> 1:07:13.820
 And then they look at their watch and they go,

1:07:13.820 --> 1:07:15.340
 five minutes went by, nothing changed.

1:07:15.340 --> 1:07:19.900
 It's gonna take years, but everybody wants it now, now, now.

1:07:20.820 --> 1:07:23.860
 What, Austin, there's no industry there.

1:07:23.860 --> 1:07:25.340
 There's no Netflix, whatever.

1:07:25.340 --> 1:07:27.300
 And you're like, yeah, I know, but it needs a minute.

1:07:27.300 --> 1:07:28.580
 You can't just do this overnight.

1:07:28.580 --> 1:07:30.040
 So people forget that.

1:07:30.040 --> 1:07:33.220
 So it could happen huge, just give it some time.

1:07:33.220 --> 1:07:35.060
 I mean, he's opening a club, I went and saw it.

1:07:35.060 --> 1:07:37.980
 It's incredible, like it's so perfect for comedy.

1:07:37.980 --> 1:07:39.900
 It's every detail, it's incredible.

1:07:39.900 --> 1:07:44.020
 But so it could happen still.

1:07:44.020 --> 1:07:47.200
 I do think there's a little biting off more

1:07:47.200 --> 1:07:50.860
 than they can chew with Austin because it's not that big.

1:07:50.860 --> 1:07:51.700
 So like.

1:07:51.700 --> 1:07:52.520
 And it's spread out.

1:07:52.520 --> 1:07:53.360
 I mean, yeah, it's not big.

1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:57.420
 And the infrastructure is not quite there to support it.

1:07:57.420 --> 1:08:01.860
 But it has a lot of, comparing from the tech side,

1:08:03.100 --> 1:08:04.960
 it has a lot of land to expand into.

1:08:04.960 --> 1:08:07.260
 So it might become this. That helps.

1:08:07.260 --> 1:08:08.800
 Like you're basically establishing,

1:08:08.800 --> 1:08:10.020
 it's kind of like when you're in New York,

1:08:10.020 --> 1:08:12.780
 you're establishing these whole neighborhoods.

1:08:12.780 --> 1:08:14.220
 And you have the freedom to do that

1:08:14.220 --> 1:08:17.380
 because there's a lot of space on all sides.

1:08:17.380 --> 1:08:18.700
 Yes, okay, so that helps.

1:08:18.700 --> 1:08:20.620
 So again, maybe some time.

1:08:22.360 --> 1:08:24.620
 I do agree with that new hope

1:08:24.620 --> 1:08:27.140
 that's kind of built into human beings of like,

1:08:27.140 --> 1:08:29.540
 let's go to America, let's go to the utopia.

1:08:29.540 --> 1:08:30.660
 We even have it with space.

1:08:30.660 --> 1:08:32.100
 Let's go to Mars.

1:08:32.100 --> 1:08:33.240
 We gotta see what's over there.

1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:37.260
 And it's just red, dusty bullshit, but you still gotta go.

1:08:37.260 --> 1:08:40.380
 So I'm with you on that about this new hope, this new land.

1:08:41.260 --> 1:08:42.740
 And I think that is beautiful.

1:08:42.740 --> 1:08:43.940
 And I think there's a lot of haters.

1:08:43.940 --> 1:08:46.940
 I think there's a lot of naysayers who hate change,

1:08:46.940 --> 1:08:48.260
 who hate anything new.

1:08:48.260 --> 1:08:50.940
 And then I think you gotta go, hey, that hurts, that sucks,

1:08:50.940 --> 1:08:53.000
 but blow me dickless.

1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:54.020
 I'm trying something.

1:08:54.020 --> 1:08:55.340
 You're a loser.

1:08:55.340 --> 1:08:57.060
 Stop hating on me.

1:08:57.060 --> 1:08:59.280
 I mean, how many people hate Elon Musk?

1:08:59.280 --> 1:09:00.580
 Yeah, it's hilarious.

1:09:00.580 --> 1:09:03.620
 I mean, there's some of the criticism on Austin.

1:09:03.620 --> 1:09:04.860
 It's like a fad.

1:09:04.860 --> 1:09:07.820
 Like a lot of people are really, people are excited

1:09:07.820 --> 1:09:10.740
 about Austin and somehow that's like,

1:09:10.740 --> 1:09:12.560
 it's like when Green Day became famous,

1:09:12.560 --> 1:09:15.280
 you no longer want to be a fan of Green Day.

1:09:15.280 --> 1:09:17.340
 But to me, like that's...

1:09:17.340 --> 1:09:18.940
 Well, Austin was already a cool town.

1:09:18.940 --> 1:09:21.340
 Like every comic five years ago, it's like,

1:09:21.340 --> 1:09:23.920
 oh, I got Austin this weekend, I can't wait.

1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:25.340
 So it already had a buzz,

1:09:25.340 --> 1:09:29.380
 but some people think maybe the buzz was the cool part.

1:09:29.380 --> 1:09:33.100
 The fact that it was like this off the beaten path city

1:09:33.100 --> 1:09:35.580
 and now I get to visit it and then leave.

1:09:35.580 --> 1:09:37.380
 But I think it could still be

1:09:37.380 --> 1:09:40.340
 this comedy tech booming place.

1:09:40.340 --> 1:09:43.240
 It just will take some time and people want it right now.

1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:46.980
 Well, on the tech side, it's...

1:09:46.980 --> 1:09:47.820
 It's already there?

1:09:47.820 --> 1:09:50.160
 It's getting there very fast.

1:09:50.160 --> 1:09:53.780
 So, I mean, Elon's really pushing that with the factory.

1:09:53.780 --> 1:09:58.520
 It's just a huge number of people are moving there with jobs.

1:09:58.520 --> 1:10:00.300
 Like you're already starting.

1:10:00.300 --> 1:10:03.000
 And then the opportunities to launch new companies

1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:04.060
 is just incredible.

1:10:04.060 --> 1:10:05.820
 I guess it's not right now.

1:10:05.820 --> 1:10:09.160
 It's like within months, within a year, that kind of thing.

1:10:09.160 --> 1:10:11.620
 But like, it's an opportunity to just

1:10:11.620 --> 1:10:14.440
 start to build shit in a new place.

1:10:14.440 --> 1:10:15.280
 And it's cool.

1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:17.180
 It's kind of like going to Mars.

1:10:17.180 --> 1:10:18.580
 It's like you get to start over.

1:10:18.580 --> 1:10:20.780
 Yeah, and I like the hope aspect.

1:10:20.780 --> 1:10:22.720
 I think that's huge for people.

1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:25.380
 And I'm all for it.

1:10:25.380 --> 1:10:26.340
 I hope it works out.

1:10:26.340 --> 1:10:27.460
 I don't know if it will,

1:10:27.460 --> 1:10:29.620
 but I don't know anything about economies

1:10:29.620 --> 1:10:32.100
 and city planning and all that shit.

1:10:32.100 --> 1:10:35.980
 So it might be too early to say, but I hope it works.

1:10:35.980 --> 1:10:37.860
 Are you still talking about Austin or Mars?

1:10:37.860 --> 1:10:38.700
 Austin.

1:10:38.700 --> 1:10:41.620
 Mars is, eh, there's nothing there.

1:10:41.620 --> 1:10:42.900
 There's no vagina there.

1:10:42.900 --> 1:10:44.140
 There's no food there.

1:10:44.140 --> 1:10:45.040
 There's no water there.

1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:45.880
 I don't know.

1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:48.180
 It seems, I get space travel.

1:10:48.180 --> 1:10:49.100
 I think it's important.

1:10:49.100 --> 1:10:53.560
 But I don't know Mars is really gonna move the needle.

1:10:55.860 --> 1:10:59.700
 So what are your thoughts about Elon Musk and SpaceX

1:10:59.700 --> 1:11:01.580
 and launching rockets into space?

1:11:01.580 --> 1:11:04.260
 I think it's all good because you could say,

1:11:04.260 --> 1:11:05.660
 hey, we could just feed everybody.

1:11:05.660 --> 1:11:07.260
 And I was like, yeah, that's true.

1:11:07.260 --> 1:11:08.660
 By the way, these guys give a ton of money

1:11:08.660 --> 1:11:11.820
 to philanthropy shit that nobody cares about.

1:11:11.820 --> 1:11:13.100
 By the way, it's weird.

1:11:13.100 --> 1:11:17.780
 He could feed Nigeria with pocket change of his.

1:11:17.780 --> 1:11:20.180
 And you're like, well, maybe he has.

1:11:20.180 --> 1:11:21.820
 I heard Bill Gates gave back so much money

1:11:21.820 --> 1:11:23.420
 he saved 6 million lives.

1:11:23.420 --> 1:11:26.220
 But that's a reverse Holocaust, by the way.

1:11:26.220 --> 1:11:27.320
 That's pretty good.

1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:28.160
 What have you done?

1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:29.260
 You're a barista.

1:11:29.260 --> 1:11:34.260
 So I just think space travel is good

1:11:34.620 --> 1:11:37.820
 because you learn about the place you're living in

1:11:37.820 --> 1:11:39.780
 from going to space.

1:11:39.780 --> 1:11:42.740
 It kind of helps you learn about this more.

1:11:42.740 --> 1:11:44.420
 You could say, what's the point of going to this other there?

1:11:44.420 --> 1:11:46.660
 But it does help, I think.

1:11:46.660 --> 1:11:49.900
 Yeah, doing difficult things in the engineering space

1:11:49.900 --> 1:11:54.700
 seems to be a way to develop as almost like an accident,

1:11:54.700 --> 1:11:57.140
 as a side effect of doing a really difficult thing

1:11:57.140 --> 1:11:58.720
 in a team of brilliant people.

1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:01.060
 You develop things like the internet.

1:12:01.060 --> 1:12:02.620
 And you could argue that the internet

1:12:02.620 --> 1:12:04.180
 maybe is not so good for society.

1:12:04.180 --> 1:12:05.060
 No, I'm just kidding.

1:12:05.060 --> 1:12:06.060
 It's good and bad.

1:12:06.060 --> 1:12:06.900
 Yeah.

1:12:06.900 --> 1:12:07.980
 But it's like a pull up.

1:12:07.980 --> 1:12:09.240
 You're trying to get your bicep going,

1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:12.140
 but hey, before you know it, you got decent forearms.

1:12:12.140 --> 1:12:13.460
 But you weren't working on the forearms,

1:12:13.460 --> 1:12:15.820
 you wanted to buy, but you got the fore.

1:12:15.820 --> 1:12:18.600
 And I think that's kind of what space travel is.

1:12:18.600 --> 1:12:22.420
 I like how this pivoted into a workout routine advice.

1:12:22.420 --> 1:12:25.060
 I'm trying to get an analogy going here.

1:12:25.060 --> 1:12:26.500
 All right, they work pretty well.

1:12:26.500 --> 1:12:27.340
 I'll take it.

1:12:27.340 --> 1:12:28.180
 All right.

1:12:28.180 --> 1:12:32.300
 What are your thoughts about, since I'm a robotics person,

1:12:32.300 --> 1:12:37.300
 I'd be curious to see, do you think about the space at all?

1:12:37.900 --> 1:12:39.780
 About, first of all, autonomous vehicles

1:12:39.780 --> 1:12:44.780
 with Tesla Autopilot and Waymo self driving car.

1:12:45.260 --> 1:12:46.300
 I'm not sure if you're familiar

1:12:46.300 --> 1:12:48.700
 with all the autonomous vehicles and so on.

1:12:48.700 --> 1:12:51.020
 So those are robots on wheels.

1:12:51.020 --> 1:12:52.920
 And then there's also legged robots.

1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:54.860
 So next time you're in Austin,

1:12:54.860 --> 1:12:56.500
 you get to meet some of the legged robots.

1:12:56.500 --> 1:13:00.300
 That's what I've been working on.

1:13:00.300 --> 1:13:04.700
 And I find those kind of a fascinating way

1:13:04.700 --> 1:13:09.700
 to explore the nature of intelligence in our computers,

1:13:10.040 --> 1:13:13.580
 but also explore our own intelligence

1:13:13.580 --> 1:13:15.300
 and also explore our own,

1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:20.860
 like what makes us connect to other living beings,

1:13:20.860 --> 1:13:24.020
 whether it's dogs, cats, or other humans.

1:13:24.020 --> 1:13:26.100
 Like there's some magic there

1:13:26.100 --> 1:13:27.980
 that's beyond just intelligence.

1:13:27.980 --> 1:13:30.460
 And I, like when I have the robot dog,

1:13:30.460 --> 1:13:34.500
 there's some aspect to it that, I don't know,

1:13:34.500 --> 1:13:37.100
 brings me joy in a way that a dog does,

1:13:37.100 --> 1:13:38.400
 in a way that a good friend does.

1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:39.740
 Yeah, that's interesting.

1:13:39.740 --> 1:13:43.420
 And I'm not sure if that's some kind of anthropomorphism,

1:13:43.420 --> 1:13:47.400
 like where I'm projecting my hopes for this,

1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:50.940
 what this thing is, but it's kind of built in.

1:13:50.940 --> 1:13:52.620
 I mean, it's just a source of joy.

1:13:52.620 --> 1:13:54.460
 Maybe it's connected to the fact

1:13:54.460 --> 1:13:56.460
 that there's just like a loneliness

1:13:56.460 --> 1:13:58.660
 within all of us, within me.

1:13:58.660 --> 1:14:03.340
 And it's just nice to have other things in your life

1:14:03.340 --> 1:14:05.860
 that move, that recognize you, that kind of thing.

1:14:05.860 --> 1:14:09.140
 I mean, I suppose it's nice to even just have a plant.

1:14:09.140 --> 1:14:10.140
 Yeah, it is.

1:14:10.140 --> 1:14:10.980
 Plant goes a long way.

1:14:10.980 --> 1:14:12.460
 You see a guy with plants in his apartment,

1:14:12.460 --> 1:14:14.260
 it changes the apartment because they're alive.

1:14:14.260 --> 1:14:15.100
 You gotta water them.

1:14:15.100 --> 1:14:15.980
 You gotta put sun on them.

1:14:15.980 --> 1:14:17.580
 So yeah, I think there's something there.

1:14:17.580 --> 1:14:19.720
 And I think you can see people's reactions

1:14:19.720 --> 1:14:22.580
 when you show them advanced technology,

1:14:22.580 --> 1:14:25.740
 like these dog robots or these robots that dance and shit.

1:14:25.740 --> 1:14:27.700
 People are like, what the fuck?

1:14:27.700 --> 1:14:30.220
 Like it hits home in some way, whether it's fear

1:14:30.220 --> 1:14:33.800
 or you wanna fuck them clearly, whatever it is,

1:14:33.800 --> 1:14:36.460
 but it does connect with you in some way.

1:14:36.460 --> 1:14:38.480
 So I'm with you.

1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:41.000
 And I think this is why I don't think robots will take over.

1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:42.820
 You always hear that robot, they're making them too advanced.

1:14:42.820 --> 1:14:45.900
 They're gonna wipe us out, blah, blah, blah.

1:14:45.900 --> 1:14:50.260
 If robots get at human emotions, that is scary

1:14:50.260 --> 1:14:52.140
 because they could get mad at us and kill us

1:14:52.140 --> 1:14:53.520
 and they're stronger and they don't need sleep.

1:14:53.520 --> 1:14:54.360
 They don't need food.

1:14:54.360 --> 1:14:55.680
 They don't need water.

1:14:55.680 --> 1:14:56.940
 They don't get jealous.

1:14:56.940 --> 1:14:59.360
 But if they have emotions,

1:14:59.360 --> 1:15:01.360
 then I think we can dominate them

1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:04.220
 because who knows emotions better than us?

1:15:04.220 --> 1:15:05.780
 We've got thousands of years

1:15:05.780 --> 1:15:08.260
 of evolutionary emotional bullshit.

1:15:08.260 --> 1:15:10.260
 We can go, hey robot, I heard your wife

1:15:10.260 --> 1:15:12.260
 fucked that black and Decker, huh?

1:15:12.260 --> 1:15:13.800
 They're gonna crumble.

1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:15.260
 We can bully them.

1:15:15.260 --> 1:15:16.820
 Emotionally manipulate robots.

1:15:16.820 --> 1:15:18.600
 Yes, that's when we'll win.

1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:21.220
 Right now, they could kill us.

1:15:21.220 --> 1:15:23.060
 They could just, we'd all die.

1:15:23.060 --> 1:15:24.860
 Then we shoot them back, bing, bing, bing, bing.

1:15:24.860 --> 1:15:25.820
 That's no good.

1:15:25.820 --> 1:15:28.220
 But if they do get emotions, then we can go,

1:15:28.220 --> 1:15:29.520
 hey, you look like hell.

1:15:29.520 --> 1:15:30.600
 What is that, a rusty bolt?

1:15:30.600 --> 1:15:32.800
 Hey, you're dropping some oil there, you loser.

1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:35.300
 I think we can win if they do get emotions.

1:15:35.300 --> 1:15:37.300
 This goes back to your father being able

1:15:37.300 --> 1:15:39.620
 to undercut you with a single word.

1:15:39.620 --> 1:15:40.460
 You're right.

1:15:40.460 --> 1:15:42.260
 Yeah, so we're the creators of the robots

1:15:42.260 --> 1:15:43.580
 and then the robots will just,

1:15:43.580 --> 1:15:46.620
 you would say the exact thing

1:15:46.620 --> 1:15:49.300
 where the robot would be like, that son of a bitch.

1:15:49.300 --> 1:15:51.340
 And then it goes back to his hole

1:15:51.340 --> 1:15:52.980
 and just sits there miserable.

1:15:52.980 --> 1:15:55.900
 Right, yeah, hardware looks more like software to me.

1:15:55.900 --> 1:15:59.080
 You can't get it up, yada, yada, yada.

1:15:59.080 --> 1:16:00.300
 But I'm not worried about robots

1:16:00.300 --> 1:16:01.900
 and I think self, what do you think

1:16:01.900 --> 1:16:03.260
 about the self driving cars?

1:16:03.260 --> 1:16:06.500
 Is that just wiping out the horse and buggy?

1:16:06.500 --> 1:16:09.340
 Isn't that just progression of technology?

1:16:09.340 --> 1:16:11.780
 Yeah, so I don't know if you've driven in a Tesla,

1:16:11.780 --> 1:16:12.620
 for example.

1:16:12.620 --> 1:16:16.140
 I have, I rode in the passenger, I just drive it.

1:16:16.140 --> 1:16:18.180
 Yeah, there's several stages in that.

1:16:18.180 --> 1:16:20.860
 I think it's the problem is way harder than people realize.

1:16:20.860 --> 1:16:22.380
 And for quite a while,

1:16:22.380 --> 1:16:24.300
 it'll just make driving more pleasant.

1:16:24.300 --> 1:16:26.720
 It'll make it less stressful.

1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:29.660
 It'll take over some of the boring bits for you

1:16:29.660 --> 1:16:30.500
 and make it easier.

1:16:30.500 --> 1:16:31.920
 Like there's something that happens actually

1:16:31.920 --> 1:16:36.500
 when the car is driving for you in the following way.

1:16:36.500 --> 1:16:38.800
 Like it's staying in the lane,

1:16:38.800 --> 1:16:40.380
 it's keeping distance to the car in front of you.

1:16:40.380 --> 1:16:42.420
 Maybe it's changing lanes.

1:16:42.420 --> 1:16:44.460
 It allows you to relax a little bit.

1:16:44.460 --> 1:16:48.080
 Like you become, you still have to be alert,

1:16:48.080 --> 1:16:49.540
 but you become like a passenger

1:16:49.540 --> 1:16:51.300
 and you get to like take in the world.

1:16:51.300 --> 1:16:53.620
 I mean, somehow that's more relaxing

1:16:53.620 --> 1:16:58.460
 without making you necessarily like bored more.

1:16:58.460 --> 1:16:59.860
 It's energizing more.

1:16:59.860 --> 1:17:01.620
 So I just think it makes the driving experience

1:17:01.620 --> 1:17:02.560
 more pleasant.

1:17:02.560 --> 1:17:05.220
 But when you actually fully automate cars,

1:17:05.220 --> 1:17:06.660
 when you can just completely tune out

1:17:06.660 --> 1:17:09.040
 and start reading a book or go to sleep,

1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:13.940
 that might change society like in ways

1:17:13.940 --> 1:17:15.600
 we don't even understand.

1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:20.180
 Because you'll have, I mean the,

1:17:20.180 --> 1:17:22.060
 it'll probably change the nature of roads

1:17:22.060 --> 1:17:25.700
 because the cars, because now you can be super productive.

1:17:25.700 --> 1:17:28.500
 And so no longer quite matters to you

1:17:28.500 --> 1:17:31.980
 as much how long it takes to get from point A to point B

1:17:31.980 --> 1:17:34.340
 because you're not wasting that time.

1:17:34.340 --> 1:17:37.100
 You just continue working.

1:17:37.100 --> 1:17:40.060
 It's like public transit that comes to you.

1:17:40.060 --> 1:17:43.940
 And so there will be maybe less roads and bigger roads

1:17:43.940 --> 1:17:46.380
 and it will just change the nature of how we get

1:17:46.380 --> 1:17:47.300
 from point A to point B.

1:17:47.300 --> 1:17:48.140
 I think you're right.

1:17:48.140 --> 1:17:50.380
 But then couple that also with the fact

1:17:50.380 --> 1:17:53.460
 that we seem to be more and more comfortable

1:17:53.460 --> 1:17:55.180
 existing in the digital world.

1:17:55.180 --> 1:17:56.020
 Yeah.

1:17:56.020 --> 1:17:59.100
 So like maybe we won't want to go outside more and more.

1:17:59.100 --> 1:18:01.220
 We will just interact with each other virtually.

1:18:01.220 --> 1:18:02.380
 And I don't mean Zoom meetings.

1:18:02.380 --> 1:18:07.380
 I mean, just in other ways that's more fulfilling

1:18:09.100 --> 1:18:11.780
 than a Zoom meeting, but then maybe not

1:18:11.780 --> 1:18:14.380
 because like there's something deeply uncompelling

1:18:15.540 --> 1:18:16.540
 about Zoom meetings.

1:18:16.540 --> 1:18:18.760
 Like podcasts that are remote,

1:18:19.660 --> 1:18:21.600
 unless they're super information dense,

1:18:21.600 --> 1:18:24.020
 at least to me as a podcast fan, kind of suck.

1:18:24.020 --> 1:18:24.860
 They suck.

1:18:24.860 --> 1:18:25.680
 There's no connection.

1:18:25.680 --> 1:18:26.980
 It goes back to the dog thing.

1:18:26.980 --> 1:18:28.900
 With the Zoom, there's no connection.

1:18:28.900 --> 1:18:29.740
 Yeah.

1:18:29.740 --> 1:18:31.460
 And we're not, you know, I don't understand why

1:18:31.460 --> 1:18:32.780
 we're not even making eye contact.

1:18:32.780 --> 1:18:33.760
 I know.

1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:34.740
 But it's something there.

1:18:34.740 --> 1:18:35.580
 It's in the room.

1:18:35.580 --> 1:18:36.420
 There's pheromones.

1:18:36.420 --> 1:18:39.100
 And that's like out of our understanding probably.

1:18:39.100 --> 1:18:41.480
 It's just some kind of weird biological,

1:18:41.480 --> 1:18:43.540
 you know, you ever have Cheerios in a bowl?

1:18:43.540 --> 1:18:47.140
 The Cheerios tend to, they tend to go together.

1:18:47.140 --> 1:18:48.640
 You see a cluster of Cheerios.

1:18:48.640 --> 1:18:50.280
 They're never really hanging out on the other side.

1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:53.580
 And that's kind of how people are in real life.

1:18:53.580 --> 1:18:55.080
 I wonder what the physics of that is.

1:18:55.080 --> 1:18:57.380
 So they come together and they stick.

1:18:57.380 --> 1:18:59.260
 There's so many with molecules.

1:18:59.260 --> 1:19:00.340
 I don't know, I can't remember what it was,

1:19:00.340 --> 1:19:01.180
 but it was fascinating.

1:19:01.180 --> 1:19:02.300
 And I think that's how people are.

1:19:02.300 --> 1:19:04.900
 And I think you try to write a TV show

1:19:04.900 --> 1:19:09.900
 or craft a movie with your team, Zoom, nothing there.

1:19:09.900 --> 1:19:10.740
 Nothing there.

1:19:10.740 --> 1:19:13.880
 It's like phone sex versus penetration.

1:19:14.980 --> 1:19:16.220
 One day you'll learn that.

1:19:16.220 --> 1:19:18.260
 I know nothing of either of the,

1:19:18.260 --> 1:19:19.100
 I look forward,

1:19:19.100 --> 1:19:21.600
 because I think there's a phone sex Netflix documentary

1:19:21.600 --> 1:19:23.940
 that there's a show or something like that

1:19:23.940 --> 1:19:27.020
 that is really popular that I want to go watch.

1:19:27.020 --> 1:19:28.980
 So at least I can learn about that.

1:19:28.980 --> 1:19:29.820
 Okay.

1:19:29.820 --> 1:19:31.140
 I could send you some links.

1:19:31.140 --> 1:19:31.980
 Like really.

1:19:31.980 --> 1:19:32.800
 Oh, on the internet?

1:19:32.800 --> 1:19:33.980
 Yeah, yeah.

1:19:33.980 --> 1:19:34.820
 Yeah.

1:19:34.820 --> 1:19:36.040
 But yeah, self driving car.

1:19:36.040 --> 1:19:37.660
 I think it's just inevitable.

1:19:37.660 --> 1:19:39.300
 It's coming and these truckers

1:19:39.300 --> 1:19:42.100
 are going to have to figure something out.

1:19:42.100 --> 1:19:42.940
 Yeah.

1:19:42.940 --> 1:19:45.260
 I mean, that's an under understood industry actually,

1:19:45.260 --> 1:19:46.280
 because there's not,

1:19:47.460 --> 1:19:50.380
 there's a lot of trucking jobs and people don't want to,

1:19:50.380 --> 1:19:52.460
 well, people don't want to actually take them anymore

1:19:52.460 --> 1:19:53.780
 because it's such a difficult job.

1:19:53.780 --> 1:19:56.160
 So it won't have,

1:19:56.160 --> 1:19:58.300
 or a lot of people believe it won't have

1:19:58.300 --> 1:20:01.640
 as big of a negative impact as folks anticipate.

1:20:01.640 --> 1:20:02.840
 There'll be other automation.

1:20:02.840 --> 1:20:04.660
 I think they'll have a huge impact.

1:20:04.660 --> 1:20:06.100
 Yeah, for sure.

1:20:06.100 --> 1:20:07.300
 I mean, you already see it in McDonald's.

1:20:07.300 --> 1:20:08.540
 You go to the beep, beep, beep.

1:20:08.540 --> 1:20:09.460
 Why do you want to get yelled at

1:20:09.460 --> 1:20:11.460
 by the heavyset woman of color,

1:20:11.460 --> 1:20:13.480
 you know, for making a bad order

1:20:13.480 --> 1:20:16.460
 when you can just, you know, hit the screen?

1:20:16.460 --> 1:20:19.100
 But those interactions I think are human.

1:20:19.100 --> 1:20:20.060
 I mean, that's part of life.

1:20:20.060 --> 1:20:22.260
 So it is scary taking away everything.

1:20:22.260 --> 1:20:24.060
 How long till we're not fucking?

1:20:24.060 --> 1:20:25.260
 That's coming too.

1:20:25.260 --> 1:20:26.100
 Yeah.

1:20:26.100 --> 1:20:27.860
 Then there's going to have two types of people.

1:20:27.860 --> 1:20:29.940
 Are you a fuck in real life?

1:20:29.940 --> 1:20:31.380
 Are you a digital fuck person?

1:20:31.380 --> 1:20:32.220
 Oh, I'm a digital.

1:20:32.220 --> 1:20:33.140
 Oh, I like real fucking.

1:20:33.140 --> 1:20:34.460
 Sorry, we can't date.

1:20:34.460 --> 1:20:35.540
 That's coming.

1:20:35.540 --> 1:20:39.940
 Well, there's also the reproduction side of sex,

1:20:39.940 --> 1:20:42.100
 which is like with genetic engineering,

1:20:42.100 --> 1:20:45.980
 you'll be able to specify a little bit of details.

1:20:45.980 --> 1:20:47.780
 I talked to Jamie Mertzel about that.

1:20:47.780 --> 1:20:52.580
 Like where you can specify like,

1:20:55.160 --> 1:20:56.380
 it'll start with like,

1:20:56.380 --> 1:21:00.380
 I want my child not to have like a high likelihood

1:21:00.380 --> 1:21:02.060
 of diabetes or something like that.

1:21:02.060 --> 1:21:04.740
 And then you just get to specify like intelligence.

1:21:04.740 --> 1:21:07.100
 You just get to specify those kinds of parameters

1:21:07.100 --> 1:21:10.940
 until you're like basically trying to create a perfect human

1:21:10.940 --> 1:21:12.580
 and you lose some of the magic of the flaws

1:21:12.580 --> 1:21:13.740
 that make us who we are.

1:21:13.740 --> 1:21:14.660
 Yes.

1:21:14.660 --> 1:21:19.660
 And you know, I'm pretty sure in the full lineup of humans,

1:21:19.860 --> 1:21:23.620
 like, so let me give you some information.

1:21:23.620 --> 1:21:24.460
 Lay it off me, buddy.

1:21:24.460 --> 1:21:26.020
 Break it down.

1:21:26.020 --> 1:21:29.460
 I'm sure you researched this thoroughly,

1:21:29.460 --> 1:21:33.860
 but a male of the human species,

1:21:33.860 --> 1:21:38.860
 the homo sapien produces 500 billion sperm cells

1:21:40.100 --> 1:21:41.620
 in a lifetime.

1:21:41.620 --> 1:21:45.420
 So that's all, some more than others.

1:21:46.500 --> 1:21:50.920
 That's all uniquely, genetically unique humans

1:21:50.920 --> 1:21:51.760
 that you could produce.

1:21:51.760 --> 1:21:54.640
 So even across those 500 billion, you can select.

1:21:55.580 --> 1:21:56.420
 And so.

1:21:56.420 --> 1:21:58.140
 What do you mean, like abort some or?

1:21:58.140 --> 1:22:00.380
 No, you can choose which of them you want.

1:22:00.380 --> 1:22:03.020
 I mean, just imagine all the genetic possibilities

1:22:03.020 --> 1:22:05.020
 that are there, like all of the possible,

1:22:05.020 --> 1:22:07.940
 like you won the race.

1:22:07.940 --> 1:22:08.780
 Yes.

1:22:09.780 --> 1:22:10.620
 Shocking.

1:22:10.620 --> 1:22:11.440
 Yeah, this is the winner.

1:22:11.440 --> 1:22:13.020
 Which one out of all the 500 billion?

1:22:13.020 --> 1:22:15.620
 You have to imagine what the competition was.

1:22:15.620 --> 1:22:18.540
 Oh, just tarts all day long.

1:22:18.540 --> 1:22:19.940
 Handicap.

1:22:19.940 --> 1:22:23.100
 Well, so it's not actually the fastest sperm

1:22:23.100 --> 1:22:26.780
 or like it's, I think a lot of it is timing and luck.

1:22:26.780 --> 1:22:27.620
 Ah.

1:22:27.620 --> 1:22:28.440
 That's what it seems like.

1:22:28.440 --> 1:22:29.280
 There's actual papers on this

1:22:29.280 --> 1:22:30.980
 and I've actually been reading them.

1:22:30.980 --> 1:22:31.940
 I hope so.

1:22:31.940 --> 1:22:34.100
 So it's not just like the fastest sperm to the egg.

1:22:34.100 --> 1:22:34.940
 Okay.

1:22:34.940 --> 1:22:36.280
 There's a timing thing.

1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:37.980
 So you were just lucky.

1:22:37.980 --> 1:22:39.320
 All right.

1:22:39.320 --> 1:22:40.540
 I believe that.

1:22:40.540 --> 1:22:42.060
 So it's interesting to think about like,

1:22:42.060 --> 1:22:46.980
 once you're able to specify some parameters

1:22:46.980 --> 1:22:49.220
 of what your child is like,

1:22:49.220 --> 1:22:51.460
 how that changes the nature of

1:22:53.660 --> 1:22:57.780
 even just like the intimacy of two humans getting together

1:22:57.780 --> 1:23:02.320
 and making, creating together a child.

1:23:02.320 --> 1:23:03.160
 Yeah.

1:23:03.160 --> 1:23:04.640
 I mean, it changes it.

1:23:04.640 --> 1:23:06.040
 It's almost like, I don't know,

1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:10.740
 it becomes like a factory line of some kind.

1:23:10.740 --> 1:23:12.920
 If you don't meet naturally.

1:23:12.920 --> 1:23:15.320
 Yeah, if you don't meet naturally and then you don't

1:23:15.320 --> 1:23:18.640
 and you get to optimize your child,

1:23:18.640 --> 1:23:21.880
 then it's some like you have to consider

1:23:21.880 --> 1:23:23.360
 utilitarian type of things,

1:23:23.360 --> 1:23:25.480
 like what's good for society

1:23:25.480 --> 1:23:28.320
 and it'll probably be regulation about what kind of children

1:23:28.320 --> 1:23:29.520
 you can have or not.

1:23:29.520 --> 1:23:32.200
 Like your child can not have an IQ below this

1:23:32.200 --> 1:23:34.120
 or above this or something like that.

1:23:34.120 --> 1:23:35.720
 Or your child can not.

1:23:35.720 --> 1:23:39.200
 We already kind of do that with VIP clubs.

1:23:39.200 --> 1:23:40.920
 Like, ah, you're kind of ugly

1:23:40.920 --> 1:23:43.260
 or women go, hey, he's not tall enough.

1:23:43.260 --> 1:23:44.480
 We kind of do it a little.

1:23:44.480 --> 1:23:45.320
 Yeah.

1:23:45.320 --> 1:23:46.560
 Especially sexually.

1:23:46.560 --> 1:23:47.380
 Yeah, we do.

1:23:47.380 --> 1:23:48.680
 Can't get on the roller coaster

1:23:48.680 --> 1:23:50.120
 if you're this short, whatever it is.

1:23:50.120 --> 1:23:52.720
 You know, we do it in some capacity.

1:23:52.720 --> 1:23:57.080
 But here, this would be like fully transparent

1:23:57.080 --> 1:24:00.080
 and to a degree that it's hard to imagine.

1:24:00.080 --> 1:24:02.000
 Like the way we currently do it,

1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:03.760
 you can at least get around it.

1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:04.600
 Yes.

1:24:04.600 --> 1:24:07.000
 You can at least trick your way onto the roller coaster

1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:08.180
 even if you're short.

1:24:08.180 --> 1:24:09.020
 Right.

1:24:09.020 --> 1:24:11.280
 Or the fat guy can get rich so he can get laid.

1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:12.720
 You know, there's other ways.

1:24:14.500 --> 1:24:16.640
 At the risk of asking the totally wrong person

1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:19.600
 this question, what advice would you give

1:24:19.600 --> 1:24:23.080
 to young people today in high school and college

1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:26.820
 about how to have a successful career

1:24:26.820 --> 1:24:28.640
 or career they're proud of

1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:30.920
 or maybe have a life that they're proud of?

1:24:30.920 --> 1:24:32.360
 Ooh.

1:24:32.360 --> 1:24:34.280
 Well, first of all, you gotta be,

1:24:34.280 --> 1:24:35.800
 you gotta want a life you're proud of.

1:24:35.800 --> 1:24:38.400
 Not everybody has any integrity.

1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:40.540
 A lot of people just want short money.

1:24:40.540 --> 1:24:44.680
 I wanna feel good, look good right now.

1:24:44.680 --> 1:24:47.360
 I wanna do Molly, boom, I'll feel good, you know?

1:24:47.360 --> 1:24:50.120
 But you should space it out.

1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:51.900
 You should, it's almost like saving money

1:24:51.900 --> 1:24:53.200
 so you can use it later.

1:24:53.200 --> 1:24:54.360
 Nobody wants to save money.

1:24:54.360 --> 1:24:56.000
 What do they say, like 11% of America

1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:59.320
 actually has money saved, $1,000 or some shit?

1:24:59.320 --> 1:25:01.480
 It's wildly low.

1:25:01.480 --> 1:25:04.280
 Everybody wants it now, now, what do you call it?

1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:06.160
 Immediate gratification.

1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:10.280
 I think the key to happiness and satisfaction

1:25:10.280 --> 1:25:12.480
 is working for something.

1:25:12.480 --> 1:25:14.920
 Even if it's, it's like a baby.

1:25:14.920 --> 1:25:16.600
 If you could have a baby in five minutes,

1:25:16.600 --> 1:25:18.720
 if a woman, you got a, you jizzed in her

1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:21.320
 and she had a baby, oop, five minutes, boom.

1:25:21.320 --> 1:25:23.120
 Newborn, healthy.

1:25:23.120 --> 1:25:25.800
 I think you'd be more likely to throw it away

1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:27.200
 if you could make it that quick.

1:25:27.200 --> 1:25:30.400
 It's the fact that you spent nine months backbreaking

1:25:30.400 --> 1:25:33.920
 the labor, the lactating, the ripped placenta

1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:36.040
 and the hymen or whatever the fuck.

1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:37.600
 That's what makes you love it.

1:25:37.600 --> 1:25:38.840
 And I think it's the same with comedy

1:25:38.840 --> 1:25:41.460
 or making money or whatever.

1:25:41.460 --> 1:25:43.720
 Look at these kids who like child stars.

1:25:43.720 --> 1:25:46.080
 They all become heroin addicts at like 22

1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:48.400
 because they've just, their sensors are burned out.

1:25:48.400 --> 1:25:49.480
 Their pleasure sensors.

1:25:49.480 --> 1:25:51.360
 You didn't have to earn it.

1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:53.720
 I think earning it is a big part of life

1:25:53.720 --> 1:25:56.600
 and always try to do better, try to do more,

1:25:56.600 --> 1:25:58.160
 try to learn new things.

1:25:58.160 --> 1:25:59.560
 Hey, I'm bored.

1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:00.720
 Life sucks.

1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:02.600
 Play the piano then you chooch.

1:26:02.600 --> 1:26:05.060
 But you won't do it because it takes effort

1:26:05.060 --> 1:26:06.680
 and failure and all that.

1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:08.400
 But that's the good part.

1:26:08.400 --> 1:26:10.260
 And I know it's hard to see.

1:26:10.260 --> 1:26:13.820
 So I think that's a good key to life

1:26:13.820 --> 1:26:16.020
 is work hard at something you care about

1:26:16.020 --> 1:26:18.640
 and then love the result.

1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:22.760
 The hard work, the journey is actually way more important

1:26:22.760 --> 1:26:23.960
 than just getting something.

1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:25.400
 Everybody wants to go on Amazon.

1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:26.320
 I got a package.

1:26:26.320 --> 1:26:27.800
 Then you feel good for 10 seconds

1:26:27.800 --> 1:26:29.800
 and all right, let's go on Amazon again.

1:26:29.800 --> 1:26:31.760
 And then it's just a dumb cycle

1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:35.500
 of you being disgusting and gluttonous.

1:26:35.500 --> 1:26:36.960
 So work for it.

1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:39.900
 Everybody wants to take steroids and just boop, I'm buff.

1:26:39.900 --> 1:26:40.840
 Why'd you point at me?

1:26:40.840 --> 1:26:41.660
 Well, I'm just saying.

1:26:41.660 --> 1:26:42.500
 Because I'm Russian or what?

1:26:42.500 --> 1:26:45.560
 Well, I saw the Icarus.

1:26:45.560 --> 1:26:47.360
 But no, I'm not saying you're on roids.

1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:48.840
 I'm just, you'd be way bigger.

1:26:48.840 --> 1:26:52.560
 But I'm just saying, you know, work for something.

1:26:52.560 --> 1:26:56.560
 And then I would also, young people eat shit early.

1:26:56.560 --> 1:26:57.820
 Eat shit early.

1:26:57.820 --> 1:27:00.780
 I know a guy who kind of got canceled or whatever

1:27:00.780 --> 1:27:03.360
 and he had an out early, but he tried to get by

1:27:03.360 --> 1:27:07.240
 and he tried to ride it and it all came crumbling down.

1:27:07.240 --> 1:27:09.440
 But if he had eaten it early, like, yeah, I fucked up.

1:27:09.440 --> 1:27:10.640
 I did that.

1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:14.600
 Whatever it was, he would've just kind of been shit on

1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:17.560
 for a month and then it would've gone away.

1:27:17.560 --> 1:27:19.960
 But now it's his whole identity and that sucks.

1:27:19.960 --> 1:27:21.080
 So eat shit early.

1:27:21.080 --> 1:27:23.280
 And I know it's hard to see, what do you mean early?

1:27:23.280 --> 1:27:24.560
 I'm in the present.

1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:28.280
 But look ahead, look back, this time will pass.

1:27:28.280 --> 1:27:29.640
 I mean, look at high school.

1:27:29.640 --> 1:27:31.320
 High school was the biggest thing in our lives.

1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:33.940
 Oh my God, this exam, Susie Q hates me.

1:27:33.940 --> 1:27:35.360
 The football player beat me up.

1:27:35.360 --> 1:27:36.640
 Oh, I'll never recover.

1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:37.700
 Now you don't even think about high school.

1:27:37.700 --> 1:27:40.320
 It's just a blip in your dumb life, you know?

1:27:40.320 --> 1:27:41.400
 And that's what this is now.

1:27:41.400 --> 1:27:42.560
 This will just be a blip.

1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:46.180
 So remember that and work towards something

1:27:46.180 --> 1:27:50.520
 and work hard and care about the result.

1:27:50.520 --> 1:27:52.160
 If the result isn't good, try it again.

1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:53.840
 And failure is not always bad.

1:27:53.840 --> 1:27:56.720
 Failure, we look at failure as this end all, be all.

1:27:56.720 --> 1:27:58.880
 My life's over, I failed.

1:27:58.880 --> 1:28:01.120
 But failure is really just learning.

1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:01.960
 So that's something.

1:28:01.960 --> 1:28:06.720
 So in summary, eat shit early and eat shit often.

1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:07.800
 Yes.

1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:09.840
 All right, Mark Norman.

1:28:09.840 --> 1:28:11.040
 Eat ass.

1:28:11.040 --> 1:28:13.080
 That's escalated quickly.

1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:16.020
 All right, I have a list of random questions for you.

1:28:16.960 --> 1:28:19.500
 What activities make you lose track of time?

1:28:19.500 --> 1:28:20.340
 Oh.

1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:24.280
 Have that go into that zone.

1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:26.960
 You have this happiness, contentment about you

1:28:26.960 --> 1:28:28.820
 that you just truly enjoy.

1:28:28.820 --> 1:28:31.240
 Yeah, I think a good conversation.

1:28:31.240 --> 1:28:34.360
 Like I'll sit at the comedy cellar with friends,

1:28:34.360 --> 1:28:36.700
 maybe a little whiskey's flowing.

1:28:36.700 --> 1:28:38.520
 And when you're really just vibing

1:28:38.520 --> 1:28:41.680
 and inhibiting.

1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:42.520
 You can do it.

1:28:42.520 --> 1:28:43.360
 What is it?

1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:44.680
 Inhibited. Inhibited.

1:28:44.680 --> 1:28:45.840
 Uninhibited. Uninhibited.

1:28:45.840 --> 1:28:47.560
 When you're just vibing and you're uninhibited

1:28:47.560 --> 1:28:49.520
 and you're saying crazy shit and you're laughing

1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:51.480
 and you're not worried, am I seeming cool right now?

1:28:51.480 --> 1:28:52.820
 Am I seeming likable?

1:28:52.820 --> 1:28:56.000
 When you're just you 100% and it's all coming out of you

1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:58.040
 and then they're saying stuff and you go back and forth

1:28:58.040 --> 1:28:59.240
 and you feel that excitement.

1:28:59.240 --> 1:29:00.800
 Oh, they're talking, but I wanna say my thing.

1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:02.560
 And you get all peed up.

1:29:02.560 --> 1:29:03.400
 I love that.

1:29:03.400 --> 1:29:04.720
 And I look at my watch, I'm like, fuck,

1:29:04.720 --> 1:29:05.960
 it's three in the morning.

1:29:05.960 --> 1:29:07.720
 We've been talking for five hours.

1:29:07.720 --> 1:29:09.040
 So I love that.

1:29:09.040 --> 1:29:10.840
 That makes the time fly by.

1:29:10.840 --> 1:29:13.320
 Also, I bought a, speaking of self driving cars,

1:29:13.320 --> 1:29:18.320
 I bought a 1973 BMW car and it's classic

1:29:18.920 --> 1:29:23.920
 and it's stick shift and it's grizzly and gritty and rusty

1:29:24.120 --> 1:29:26.480
 and it's a bucket of bolts, but I love driving it.

1:29:26.480 --> 1:29:27.760
 Bucket of bolts.

1:29:27.760 --> 1:29:28.600
 Yeah.

1:29:28.600 --> 1:29:29.800
 You and Tom Waits are poets.

1:29:29.800 --> 1:29:32.360
 Have you taken like a long trip anywhere,

1:29:32.360 --> 1:29:35.920
 like road trip in your life or with this BMW?

1:29:35.920 --> 1:29:37.600
 Not with it, it's pretty new,

1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:38.440
 but I will.

1:29:38.440 --> 1:29:39.760
 It's a new 97.

1:29:39.760 --> 1:29:42.000
 Yeah, it's new to me.

1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:45.480
 And it goes in the phase of everything we're doing now.

1:29:45.480 --> 1:29:47.120
 Everything is digital, everything is automated,

1:29:47.120 --> 1:29:49.960
 everything is hands off, everything is delivered.

1:29:49.960 --> 1:29:52.720
 And this is the most hands on thing in the world.

1:29:52.720 --> 1:29:54.160
 And I am dialed in, man.

1:29:54.160 --> 1:29:56.280
 I got the tachometer, I keep an eye on that.

1:29:56.280 --> 1:29:58.440
 Oh, I put the wrong gear in, shit.

1:29:58.440 --> 1:30:00.920
 Oh, it's about to stall, put some gas, put some clutch.

1:30:00.920 --> 1:30:05.920
 And it's all just brain power and staying in focus

1:30:05.920 --> 1:30:08.680
 and all that, and it's the opposite of tweeting

1:30:08.680 --> 1:30:11.800
 and texting and watching porn or whatever.

1:30:11.800 --> 1:30:14.120
 So I almost needed that in my life,

1:30:14.120 --> 1:30:17.840
 so I bought this car just to have this little exercise.

1:30:19.280 --> 1:30:21.080
 I hope you don't mind that I'm just trying out

1:30:21.080 --> 1:30:25.800
 random questions I wrote on you that are completely insane.

1:30:25.800 --> 1:30:27.720
 I'm a guinea pig, jizz in my face.

1:30:27.720 --> 1:30:29.080
 Bring it on, baby.

1:30:30.080 --> 1:30:32.520
 This would be edited down to five minutes.

1:30:32.520 --> 1:30:34.520
 If everyone on earth disappeared

1:30:34.520 --> 1:30:39.520
 and it was just you left, what would your days look like?

1:30:39.640 --> 1:30:40.760
 What would you do?

1:30:40.760 --> 1:30:43.480
 That's tough, because I'm already an introvert

1:30:43.480 --> 1:30:45.520
 and I try to avoid people mostly.

1:30:45.520 --> 1:30:50.520
 Like I like a one on one, but crowds and all that is tough.

1:30:50.520 --> 1:30:51.360
 So.

1:30:51.360 --> 1:30:52.600
 So basically unchanged?

1:30:52.600 --> 1:30:53.920
 Yeah, that's what I was gonna say,

1:30:53.920 --> 1:30:56.280
 but then that's the irony is I would be so sad

1:30:56.280 --> 1:30:57.200
 to not talk to anybody.

1:30:57.200 --> 1:30:59.720
 So it's this weird, bittersweet thing,

1:30:59.720 --> 1:31:01.960
 but I don't know what I would do, man.

1:31:01.960 --> 1:31:03.960
 I guess it's kind of like when you're hung over,

1:31:03.960 --> 1:31:06.920
 you just go into the primal survival mode.

1:31:06.920 --> 1:31:11.920
 I gotta get food, I need water, I'm horny, jerk off.

1:31:12.480 --> 1:31:15.000
 You just go, you're not like playing the piano

1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:17.800
 or painting or at the gym.

1:31:17.800 --> 1:31:21.320
 So I think I would just go into urges, man, primal urges.

1:31:21.320 --> 1:31:24.800
 Find food, store food, am I safe?

1:31:24.800 --> 1:31:28.800
 Make weapons, build a shelter that I can't get attacked in.

1:31:28.800 --> 1:31:30.320
 I would go all survival mode.

1:31:30.320 --> 1:31:33.200
 And then once I maybe realized if I was safe or not,

1:31:33.200 --> 1:31:37.040
 there's no wild roaming dogs, I would start exploring.

1:31:37.040 --> 1:31:42.040
 And maybe somehow get a vehicle and I would try to expand

1:31:42.080 --> 1:31:43.880
 and that would be it.

1:31:43.880 --> 1:31:45.200
 And maybe I'd journal.

1:31:45.200 --> 1:31:49.280
 Exploring to what, to try to find new experiences?

1:31:49.280 --> 1:31:51.320
 New life, if there's other,

1:31:51.320 --> 1:31:53.160
 maybe there is another guy out there.

1:31:53.160 --> 1:31:55.720
 Oh, so always there's a possibility.

1:31:55.720 --> 1:31:56.840
 Yeah, hope.

1:31:56.840 --> 1:31:57.680
 Hope.

1:31:57.680 --> 1:31:58.920
 And then maybe there's a better place I could live.

1:31:58.920 --> 1:32:01.080
 Let's find that and then moving on.

1:32:01.080 --> 1:32:02.160
 Maybe there's more food over here.

1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:04.480
 So yeah, the hope would drive me.

1:32:04.480 --> 1:32:07.220
 But it would be bleak and sad and horrible also.

1:32:07.220 --> 1:32:09.820
 So what you're saying is you really want other people

1:32:09.820 --> 1:32:11.800
 to be there so you can hide from them, isn't it?

1:32:11.800 --> 1:32:15.000
 Yes, yes, well said.

1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:17.840
 All right, what's an item on your bucket list

1:32:17.840 --> 1:32:19.200
 that you haven't done yet?

1:32:20.120 --> 1:32:23.600
 Think about something you'd be very upset if you died

1:32:23.600 --> 1:32:24.700
 and you haven't done.

1:32:24.700 --> 1:32:27.240
 Well, I'm terrified of having kids,

1:32:27.240 --> 1:32:28.760
 just because I'm a child myself

1:32:28.760 --> 1:32:31.900
 and I'm selfish and lazy in a way.

1:32:31.900 --> 1:32:34.560
 So kids are like, this is your whole life now, this is it.

1:32:34.560 --> 1:32:35.880
 You gotta not let this thing die.

1:32:35.880 --> 1:32:37.940
 You gotta love it, you gotta raise it.

1:32:37.940 --> 1:32:39.500
 So kids scare the shit out of me,

1:32:39.500 --> 1:32:43.840
 but I also feel like if I don't have them, I'll regret it.

1:32:43.840 --> 1:32:46.800
 Well, you've seen so many people like you

1:32:46.800 --> 1:32:48.940
 who are fundamentally changed by kids.

1:32:48.940 --> 1:32:52.600
 Like it's a source, it's a source of,

1:32:52.600 --> 1:32:54.160
 like a deep source of happiness,

1:32:54.160 --> 1:32:55.860
 even though you didn't anticipate it.

1:32:55.860 --> 1:32:57.280
 Yeah.

1:32:57.280 --> 1:32:59.800
 So you like, you penciled it into your bucket list.

1:32:59.800 --> 1:33:01.080
 Yes, yes.

1:33:01.080 --> 1:33:02.680
 You're, it might be on there.

1:33:02.680 --> 1:33:03.640
 Okay.

1:33:03.640 --> 1:33:04.520
 You want kids?

1:33:04.520 --> 1:33:06.960
 Yeah, well, I want kids.

1:33:06.960 --> 1:33:10.080
 I wanna get married, I wanna have kids.

1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:13.920
 I kind of, I don't like choice.

1:33:13.920 --> 1:33:15.640
 So in the following way,

1:33:15.640 --> 1:33:18.520
 like I appreciate the value of scarcity

1:33:18.520 --> 1:33:19.560
 and the power of scarcity.

1:33:19.560 --> 1:33:22.160
 Like I don't like the modern dating culture.

1:33:22.160 --> 1:33:23.640
 It's not some religious thing or whatever.

1:33:23.640 --> 1:33:27.240
 I just like one girl for a long time

1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:28.680
 or at least swinging for that always,

1:33:28.680 --> 1:33:30.240
 like swinging for the fences.

1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:31.720
 You could be swinging right now.

1:33:31.720 --> 1:33:32.560
 I mean, you're.

1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:34.000
 There's a different use of the word swinging.

1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:34.840
 Sure, sure.

1:33:34.840 --> 1:33:35.960
 What I'm saying, you could be clear.

1:33:35.960 --> 1:33:37.620
 You look great, you're handsome.

1:33:37.620 --> 1:33:38.460
 Yeah, thank you.

1:33:38.460 --> 1:33:39.280
 Muscular.

1:33:39.280 --> 1:33:40.120
 Thank you.

1:33:40.120 --> 1:33:40.960
 You get the job done.

1:33:40.960 --> 1:33:42.620
 So I feel like you wouldn't leave without an orgasm on her.

1:33:42.620 --> 1:33:45.440
 Yeah, but I just like to, you know, about furries.

1:33:45.440 --> 1:33:46.800
 I like to dress up as animals

1:33:46.800 --> 1:33:50.040
 and I just have trouble finding others who like the same.

1:33:50.040 --> 1:33:50.880
 They're up there.

1:33:50.880 --> 1:33:52.320
 I could show you some chat rooms.

1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:54.080
 You're also my coach for the internet.

1:33:54.080 --> 1:33:54.920
 Okay.

1:33:54.920 --> 1:33:59.920
 What are you most afraid of?

1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:01.920
 I guess on Unlived Life.

1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:07.860
 I was a big fan growing up of like wild guys, you know,

1:34:07.860 --> 1:34:10.160
 like these Teddy Roosevelt's who would go out

1:34:10.160 --> 1:34:14.520
 and hunt lions and like bar fighting guys.

1:34:14.520 --> 1:34:17.520
 I was obsessed with the Hunter S. Thompson types.

1:34:17.520 --> 1:34:21.920
 And look, this is what I love about guys like,

1:34:21.920 --> 1:34:23.540
 who's a good example?

1:34:23.540 --> 1:34:24.720
 Like Hemingway.

1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:26.400
 Hemingway was the manliest guy.

1:34:26.400 --> 1:34:28.840
 He had the rifle and the elephant gun and the whiskey

1:34:28.840 --> 1:34:31.680
 and the writing and the women and the fist fights.

1:34:31.680 --> 1:34:33.920
 But people forget that the other side of that coin

1:34:33.920 --> 1:34:36.220
 is I'm sure he was in a lot of hotel rooms weeping.

1:34:36.220 --> 1:34:37.760
 I'm sure he was lonely as fuck.

1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:39.320
 I'm sure he had some wicked hangovers.

1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:40.680
 I mean, he killed himself for Christ's sake.

1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:42.920
 So obviously he was dealing with something.

1:34:42.920 --> 1:34:46.740
 So the key to me is having this adventurous life,

1:34:46.740 --> 1:34:50.240
 living to the fullest, doing crazy shit, scaring yourself,

1:34:50.240 --> 1:34:52.520
 but also not killing yourself.

1:34:52.520 --> 1:34:54.040
 Like also not hating,

1:34:54.040 --> 1:34:56.160
 because I used to party a lot hard.

1:34:56.160 --> 1:34:58.860
 I used to bang a lot of gals.

1:34:58.860 --> 1:35:02.320
 And the flip side is like, this girl hates you now,

1:35:02.320 --> 1:35:04.880
 or you got herpes or you're hungover,

1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:06.520
 or your mom is like, where are you?

1:35:06.520 --> 1:35:07.520
 You never call me anymore.

1:35:07.520 --> 1:35:10.880
 You're like, oh, my mom, let ties go with my mom.

1:35:10.880 --> 1:35:11.840
 I gotta connect.

1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:14.720
 So there's a horrible side to the party animal.

1:35:14.720 --> 1:35:18.440
 The Keith Richards we don't see is not pretty.

1:35:18.440 --> 1:35:20.160
 I mean, he's already weird looking,

1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:23.140
 but he's partying, he's smoking, he's living.

1:35:23.140 --> 1:35:25.340
 But there's another side of that coin.

1:35:25.340 --> 1:35:26.560
 And I think the key to life

1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:30.000
 is living that fucking crazy, awesome, badass life,

1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:34.840
 and also having some meaning

1:35:34.840 --> 1:35:38.360
 and a little bit of, what's the word?

1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:39.880
 Not just not killing yourself,

1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:42.120
 not going sad, not being depressed.

1:35:42.120 --> 1:35:45.000
 There's a medium there, a sweet spot.

1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:45.940
 Does that make sense?

1:35:45.940 --> 1:35:46.780
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:35:46.780 --> 1:35:51.780
 So taking big leaps and Hemingway,

1:35:51.780 --> 1:35:53.080
 grabbing life by the balls,

1:35:53.080 --> 1:35:54.720
 but at the same time, not crushing the balls,

1:35:54.720 --> 1:35:56.520
 does that metaphor work at all?

1:35:56.520 --> 1:35:59.160
 Perfect, like Evel Knievel, we all know him.

1:35:59.160 --> 1:36:02.240
 What a badass, fearless, oh, man, what a cool dude.

1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:03.760
 He's got balls of steel.

1:36:03.760 --> 1:36:05.880
 But he also lived the back half of his life

1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:08.720
 in a fucking barka lounger

1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:10.160
 where his legs were made of steel

1:36:10.160 --> 1:36:13.120
 and he couldn't see straight and his dick didn't work.

1:36:13.120 --> 1:36:15.520
 So you know what I mean?

1:36:15.520 --> 1:36:18.120
 You gotta have a balance, but you still want the balance.

1:36:18.120 --> 1:36:20.840
 I'm willing to take a little bit of shit

1:36:20.840 --> 1:36:23.480
 for a little bit of fun,

1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:25.920
 but you don't want to go too hard.

1:36:25.920 --> 1:36:27.120
 Well, you gotta still risk it.

1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:30.400
 I mean, Hunter S. Thompson, it didn't end well.

1:36:30.400 --> 1:36:31.240
 Yeah.

1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:32.160
 But it was quite a ride.

1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:33.240
 Quite a ride.

1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:36.840
 What small act of kindness were you once shown

1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:38.160
 that you will never forget?

1:36:39.960 --> 1:36:41.440
 Wow, that's a great question.

1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:44.960
 I just wrote these for the guinea pig.

1:36:44.960 --> 1:36:45.800
 You're the guinea pig.

1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:46.960
 That's great, that's a keeper.

1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:48.080
 Keep that question. Okay, that's a keeper?

1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:48.920
 Yeah.

1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:50.200
 This is where we're like workshopping questions here.

1:36:50.200 --> 1:36:51.360
 All right, I'll take it.

1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:52.480
 Now you're open biking.

1:36:52.480 --> 1:36:53.320
 Yeah.

1:36:53.320 --> 1:36:54.240
 This is your version.

1:36:55.240 --> 1:36:57.560
 Let's see, there's a couple ladies in high school

1:36:57.560 --> 1:36:59.920
 who were kind enough to hand job me.

1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:01.720
 That was nice, which I really appreciate.

1:37:01.720 --> 1:37:04.560
 I don't think women know how much that means to us.

1:37:04.560 --> 1:37:05.400
 You know, women are like,

1:37:05.400 --> 1:37:06.720
 oh, I'm not a piece of meat or whatever.

1:37:06.720 --> 1:37:10.000
 And you're like, I know, but if you just gave me a hand job,

1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:10.840
 it would make my world.

1:37:10.840 --> 1:37:13.520
 It's like telling a kid he's smart or loved.

1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:15.720
 See, most people mention like a math teacher,

1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:19.080
 middle school, that would inspire them to get into science.

1:37:19.080 --> 1:37:21.200
 You give a shout out to the thing.

1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:23.320
 Well, that's part of it, that's not the nicest,

1:37:23.320 --> 1:37:25.160
 but I'm just saying that goes a long way.

1:37:25.160 --> 1:37:26.120
 All right.

1:37:26.120 --> 1:37:27.680
 Let's see, kindness.

1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:29.200
 That's a great question.

1:37:31.160 --> 1:37:32.880
 I wanna give you a good answer.

1:37:32.880 --> 1:37:35.080
 I got lost when I was like six.

1:37:35.080 --> 1:37:38.720
 I was walking around my dad and I zoned out and went away.

1:37:38.720 --> 1:37:41.520
 And next thing you know, I don't know where I am.

1:37:41.520 --> 1:37:42.400
 I'm in a neighborhood.

1:37:42.400 --> 1:37:45.920
 This old guy finds me crying on a lawn somewhere

1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:47.880
 and he goes, come inside.

1:37:47.880 --> 1:37:50.880
 And he tried to call my parents and nothing came of it.

1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:53.680
 Eventually they found me after like nine hours,

1:37:53.680 --> 1:37:57.960
 cops were there, the FBI is out there, fucking helicopters.

1:37:57.960 --> 1:37:59.200
 And I guess, you know, that's nice.

1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:01.320
 This old guy took me in for a couple of hours

1:38:01.320 --> 1:38:05.280
 and just sat me down and kept me safe.

1:38:05.280 --> 1:38:06.160
 That's something.

1:38:06.160 --> 1:38:07.000
 Yeah.

1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:08.280
 Oh, how about Enis?

1:38:08.280 --> 1:38:12.360
 My transvestite nanny, very kind.

1:38:13.800 --> 1:38:15.400
 He, did you hear about this?

1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:16.240
 No.

1:38:16.240 --> 1:38:19.240
 We had this transvestite nanny who was like a drag queen,

1:38:19.240 --> 1:38:20.080
 but it was in the 90s.

1:38:20.080 --> 1:38:20.920
 So it was weird.

1:38:20.920 --> 1:38:21.880
 It was new.

1:38:21.880 --> 1:38:25.680
 And my bike got stolen and he, you know,

1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:27.000
 my parents were like, eh, what are you gonna do?

1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:28.760
 They're poor kids, you know?

1:38:28.760 --> 1:38:31.160
 And he was like, fuck it, we're gonna go get that bike.

1:38:31.160 --> 1:38:33.840
 And I was like, this guy's in a wig and high heels,

1:38:33.840 --> 1:38:35.000
 big black guy.

1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:38.200
 And I'm like, ah, what are you gonna do?

1:38:38.200 --> 1:38:39.040
 You know, it's gone.

1:38:39.040 --> 1:38:40.360
 And he's like, nah, we're gonna go get it.

1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:44.040
 So we got in the van and drove around my neighborhood,

1:38:44.040 --> 1:38:46.240
 saw the kids, fuck with the bike, you know,

1:38:46.240 --> 1:38:48.120
 five street tufts.

1:38:48.120 --> 1:38:51.040
 And he goes, all right, you want to come out

1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:52.040
 or should I just do this?

1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:53.120
 And I was like, you do it.

1:38:53.120 --> 1:38:53.960
 I'm terrified.

1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:55.000
 What are you, crazy?

1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:58.760
 And he got out of the van in full, you know,

1:38:58.760 --> 1:38:59.960
 heels and wig.

1:38:59.960 --> 1:39:01.920
 And he went up to these guys and they went off.

1:39:01.920 --> 1:39:03.600
 Oh my God, look at this fucking guy,

1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:05.160
 homo faggot, all this shit.

1:39:05.160 --> 1:39:06.560
 You know, it's the 90s.

1:39:06.560 --> 1:39:09.600
 And he just stared at them long enough

1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:10.960
 to where they were kind of like, all right,

1:39:10.960 --> 1:39:12.680
 well, I guess we're gonna fight you now.

1:39:12.680 --> 1:39:14.920
 And he goes, that's not your bike.

1:39:14.920 --> 1:39:16.560
 And they go, what are you gonna do about it?

1:39:16.560 --> 1:39:18.800
 And he puts his hand on the middle of the bike

1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:19.840
 and they didn't do anything.

1:39:19.840 --> 1:39:22.480
 And he just picked it up and said, that's what I thought.

1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:25.320
 Put the bike over his shoulder, slid the van door open,

1:39:25.320 --> 1:39:27.160
 threw the bike in and we drove off.

1:39:28.200 --> 1:39:29.600
 Somebody stuck up for you.

1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:31.600
 Yeah, and you know, I mean, he could have got,

1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:33.080
 I mean, they had tools.

1:39:33.080 --> 1:39:35.880
 They could have fucking tuned him up, two seconds.

1:39:36.960 --> 1:39:39.000
 That actually like takes courage.

1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:41.240
 Oh yeah, real courage.

1:39:41.240 --> 1:39:45.040
 And then that, the reason you do an act like that

1:39:45.040 --> 1:39:48.760
 is that makes a kid like you feel like

1:39:48.760 --> 1:39:51.200
 there's somebody on your side, that's powerful.

1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:52.760
 Someone on your side is big.

1:39:52.760 --> 1:39:53.600
 Is big.

1:39:53.600 --> 1:39:54.860
 That goes a long way.

1:39:56.400 --> 1:39:57.840
 Especially when they have the risk

1:39:57.840 --> 1:40:00.080
 of getting their ass kicked or their job taken away

1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:01.040
 or whatever it is.

1:40:01.960 --> 1:40:05.400
 Now we're gonna get philosophical,

1:40:05.400 --> 1:40:07.560
 maybe a little bit emotional.

1:40:07.560 --> 1:40:12.560
 Oh, would you rather lose all your old memories

1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:15.100
 or never be able to make new ones?

1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:22.840
 It's a tough one, but I'd go easy answer, make new ones.

1:40:22.840 --> 1:40:24.600
 But don't you think all the shitty things

1:40:24.600 --> 1:40:25.960
 that happen to you?

1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:27.720
 Oh, so my hard drive is wiped clean.

1:40:27.720 --> 1:40:30.280
 It's not, is it memories

1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:34.200
 or is it how every memory affected me too?

1:40:34.200 --> 1:40:35.720
 I mean, this is a very.

1:40:35.720 --> 1:40:36.840
 Or do they go hand in hand?

1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:39.400
 I think the reality about memories

1:40:39.400 --> 1:40:40.740
 is you replay them often.

1:40:40.740 --> 1:40:43.560
 You go back to them even when you're not aware of it.

1:40:43.560 --> 1:40:45.880
 You really go, you go back often like that.

1:40:46.760 --> 1:40:47.600
 And they change.

1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:48.420
 You change them too.

1:40:48.420 --> 1:40:51.480
 Yeah, you change them to suit your understanding

1:40:51.480 --> 1:40:52.320
 of the world.

1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:53.140
 Yes.

1:40:53.140 --> 1:40:57.420
 And so the dark view you have,

1:40:57.420 --> 1:40:59.840
 both the hope and the cynicism you have about the world

1:40:59.840 --> 1:41:04.300
 is so deeply grounded in the memories

1:41:04.300 --> 1:41:05.800
 that you're basically, I would say,

1:41:05.800 --> 1:41:07.400
 if you erase all memories,

1:41:08.600 --> 1:41:10.840
 I think you're really starting over

1:41:11.840 --> 1:41:14.800
 with maybe the wisdom of how the world works,

1:41:14.800 --> 1:41:18.460
 but not so much of your personality is gone.

1:41:18.460 --> 1:41:19.680
 You would really,

1:41:21.860 --> 1:41:23.840
 it'd be interesting how your comedy would change.

1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:25.540
 Maybe you would have a good sense of timing.

1:41:25.540 --> 1:41:30.540
 You have a good sense of the writing process maybe.

1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:33.240
 But like.

1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:34.440
 Now you're making some good points,

1:41:34.440 --> 1:41:35.280
 but let me ask you this.

1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:37.780
 Let's say I go to Lake Cuomo with my girlfriend.

1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:43.000
 Now, like I wipe the memory or I keep my old memories.

1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.620
 Let's say I go to the Tuscany with the lady.

1:41:46.920 --> 1:41:48.040
 I just won't remember that?

1:41:48.040 --> 1:41:50.000
 Yeah, but you get to experience it in the moment.

1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:50.840
 Okay.

1:41:50.840 --> 1:41:51.660
 You'll get to enjoy it.

1:41:51.660 --> 1:41:53.000
 Can I look at a photo of it?

1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:55.840
 Yes.

1:41:55.840 --> 1:41:56.880
 But I would, what the hell is this?

1:41:56.880 --> 1:41:57.720
 Yeah, exactly.

1:41:57.720 --> 1:41:59.960
 Oh, fascinating.

1:41:59.960 --> 1:42:00.800
 It's exact.

1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:01.960
 The rules are pretty simple.

1:42:01.960 --> 1:42:02.800
 Yeah.

1:42:02.800 --> 1:42:04.300
 I think everyone knows how the rules go.

1:42:04.300 --> 1:42:06.640
 So you would, yeah, so what?

1:42:06.640 --> 1:42:08.540
 Well, I was gonna say start new ones,

1:42:08.540 --> 1:42:11.360
 but then I realized I wouldn't be who I was without them.

1:42:11.360 --> 1:42:12.200
 That's what you're saying.

1:42:12.200 --> 1:42:14.040
 So I guess I'd keep them.

1:42:14.040 --> 1:42:17.800
 Cause I am 38, so I've gotten a good chunk out of life.

1:42:17.800 --> 1:42:18.640
 Yeah.

1:42:18.640 --> 1:42:20.940
 And let's be honest, how many years do you have left?

1:42:20.940 --> 1:42:21.780
 I know, right?

1:42:21.780 --> 1:42:22.620
 I got AIDS.

1:42:23.780 --> 1:42:25.420
 Is it better to have loved,

1:42:25.420 --> 1:42:26.960
 okay, this question is ridiculous.

1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:29.120
 Is it better to have loved than lost

1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:31.320
 or to have never loved at all?

1:42:31.320 --> 1:42:34.560
 It sounds cliche, but there's a question.

1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:35.860
 Definitely better to loss.

1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:38.440
 So you enjoy the ups and downs.

1:42:38.440 --> 1:42:40.760
 Yeah, that's life.

1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:42.300
 We're sun and rain, baby.

1:42:44.020 --> 1:42:45.720
 I kind of like both, the whole thing.

1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:49.140
 The loss, every time you lose something,

1:42:49.140 --> 1:42:52.800
 it really makes you distinctly realize

1:42:52.800 --> 1:42:54.240
 how much you valued it.

1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:55.080
 Yes.

1:42:55.080 --> 1:43:02.080
 Like when I'm feeling alone and I'm sitting there alone

1:43:02.600 --> 1:43:06.720
 at home and I wish I could hang out with somebody,

1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:10.560
 that's like a realization how awesome people are.

1:43:10.560 --> 1:43:11.680
 Yeah.

1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:15.560
 So it's like the missing, yeah.

1:43:15.560 --> 1:43:17.320
 We don't have a lot of that in life anymore

1:43:17.320 --> 1:43:19.360
 because we can have anything we want immediately.

1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:20.720
 So the missing has gone away,

1:43:20.720 --> 1:43:25.280
 which again drives down the joy of having it.

1:43:25.280 --> 1:43:28.480
 So I think you're right, you need both.

1:43:29.280 --> 1:43:32.800
 So like you said, you have a terminal condition,

1:43:32.800 --> 1:43:34.340
 not many years left.

1:43:34.340 --> 1:43:35.680
 Do you think about your mortality?

1:43:35.680 --> 1:43:37.760
 You think about that?

1:43:37.760 --> 1:43:38.720
 All day, every day.

1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:39.560
 Are you afraid?

1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:42.400
 Not afraid, because it's inevitable.

1:43:42.400 --> 1:43:45.480
 So it's more like, how are we gonna handle this?

1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:47.720
 It's like the winter is coming,

1:43:47.720 --> 1:43:50.240
 let's stock up on some fucking nuts.

1:43:50.240 --> 1:43:51.640
 But the existential nature of it,

1:43:51.640 --> 1:43:53.480
 like the fact that this ride ends,

1:43:53.480 --> 1:43:55.440
 like what the hell are you doing any of this for?

1:43:55.440 --> 1:43:56.520
 Like, is it your?

1:43:56.520 --> 1:43:58.560
 Satisfaction, happiness.

1:43:58.560 --> 1:44:02.480
 Short term, but like there is a presumption there

1:44:02.480 --> 1:44:04.360
 that it kind of goes on forever.

1:44:04.360 --> 1:44:07.300
 I think if you truly think about the fact that it ends.

1:44:08.800 --> 1:44:10.800
 Your brain almost shuts it down.

1:44:10.800 --> 1:44:14.280
 Yeah, there's some kind of like protective like switch

1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:15.380
 that just goes off.

1:44:15.380 --> 1:44:19.320
 I mean, that's why the Stoics encourage people

1:44:19.320 --> 1:44:20.640
 to meditate on death,

1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:24.080
 because it somehow reorganizes your priorities.

1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:26.200
 It helps you like, holy shit,

1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:28.840
 this ends, make the most of the day.

1:44:28.840 --> 1:44:29.960
 It's just a nice thing,

1:44:29.960 --> 1:44:33.200
 but still you can't quite comprehend that the thing ends.

1:44:34.320 --> 1:44:35.240
 Little things too.

1:44:35.240 --> 1:44:38.660
 People go like, oh, we got a layover between our flights.

1:44:38.660 --> 1:44:40.400
 It's an hour, what are we gonna do for an hour?

1:44:40.400 --> 1:44:41.360
 It's like, what do you mean,

1:44:41.360 --> 1:44:42.520
 what are you gonna do for an hour?

1:44:42.520 --> 1:44:44.240
 You're gonna kill an hour.

1:44:44.240 --> 1:44:46.320
 How are we gonna kill this hour?

1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:47.360
 This is part of your life.

1:44:47.360 --> 1:44:48.200
 You're just trying to get rid of it,

1:44:48.200 --> 1:44:49.160
 you're just trying to kill it.

1:44:49.160 --> 1:44:50.200
 That always blew my mind.

1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:52.840
 Like, hey, fuck it, let's go hit the airport bar.

1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:57.140
 Let's get a candy bar or something, anything with bar.

1:44:57.140 --> 1:45:00.480
 But it's just, you've gotta live.

1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:01.960
 I hate this like, how are we gonna burn?

1:45:01.960 --> 1:45:04.160
 Oh, the bar didn't open for 15 minutes.

1:45:04.160 --> 1:45:05.000
 What are we gonna do?

1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:06.320
 Well, we got 15 minutes.

1:45:06.320 --> 1:45:07.600
 The world is our oyster.

1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:09.160
 Yeah, make the most of it.

1:45:09.160 --> 1:45:11.880
 And like you said, in modern day,

1:45:11.880 --> 1:45:13.740
 actually the boredom is a gift.

1:45:13.740 --> 1:45:18.460
 Like when you're waiting for something, that's a gift.

1:45:18.460 --> 1:45:20.400
 You get to be with your thoughts.

1:45:20.400 --> 1:45:21.360
 Yeah.

1:45:21.360 --> 1:45:22.760
 Those are the same thoughts you'll have

1:45:22.760 --> 1:45:24.400
 when you're on your deathbed.

1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:28.680
 There won't be a, you won't be scrolling TikTok

1:45:28.680 --> 1:45:29.700
 on your deathbed.

1:45:29.700 --> 1:45:30.760
 I hope not, Jesus.

1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:33.200
 You'd be a lot more, actually maybe you would be.

1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:34.160
 What a sad existence.

1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:35.920
 Because it would be a good,

1:45:35.920 --> 1:45:37.440
 like content creators would be like,

1:45:37.440 --> 1:45:39.360
 ooh, I'm dying, this would be good content.

1:45:39.360 --> 1:45:42.080
 Yeah, I wanna be able to sure,

1:45:42.080 --> 1:45:44.440
 film the exact moment it goes, beep.

1:45:44.440 --> 1:45:47.440
 Like last words, I wonder what my last words will be.

1:45:47.440 --> 1:45:50.920
 It'd be a good way to like end the account with a bang.

1:45:50.920 --> 1:45:52.360
 Yep, I like that.

1:45:52.360 --> 1:45:53.620
 Well, you know that you ever seen that meme

1:45:53.620 --> 1:45:54.700
 where the old guy in bed, he goes,

1:45:54.700 --> 1:45:58.520
 I wish I had tweeted more, you know, and then he dies.

1:45:58.520 --> 1:45:59.480
 It's so true.

1:45:59.480 --> 1:46:00.700
 Could be the future.

1:46:00.700 --> 1:46:02.800
 What do you think is the meaning of life?

1:46:04.540 --> 1:46:06.100
 I don't think there is one.

1:46:06.100 --> 1:46:07.840
 Everybody always throws that out there.

1:46:07.840 --> 1:46:08.680
 There isn't a meaning.

1:46:08.680 --> 1:46:11.120
 I think we're here, we're lucky to be here.

1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:13.040
 I think there's no afterlife, there's no heaven.

1:46:13.040 --> 1:46:16.080
 That's all shit we tell ourselves to feel better.

1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:18.520
 And I think you gotta just, it's like saying,

1:46:18.520 --> 1:46:23.280
 what is the meaning of this food I made?

1:46:23.280 --> 1:46:25.100
 Well, it's just you enjoy the food,

1:46:25.100 --> 1:46:26.520
 you try to get the most out of it.

1:46:26.520 --> 1:46:30.080
 You built the food, you prepared it.

1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:33.440
 So just get what you can out of it.

1:46:33.440 --> 1:46:38.440
 Don't die and try to make it last as long as possible.

1:46:38.560 --> 1:46:39.840
 Yeah, but you look at Earth,

1:46:39.840 --> 1:46:42.520
 it's like 4 billion years old.

1:46:42.520 --> 1:46:47.520
 And life started early on, like simple cell bacteria life,

1:46:47.520 --> 1:46:49.800
 like 1 billion years in.

1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:51.820
 And then it started like having lots

1:46:51.820 --> 1:46:54.800
 of aggressive interaction.

1:46:54.800 --> 1:46:57.280
 Eventually there's predator and prey and there's sex,

1:46:57.280 --> 1:47:00.200
 lots of sex, lots of sex, lots of violence.

1:47:00.200 --> 1:47:01.440
 Oh yeah.

1:47:01.440 --> 1:47:03.760
 And then, you know, through natural selection,

1:47:03.760 --> 1:47:07.480
 there's just the whole evolutionary process of animals

1:47:07.480 --> 1:47:11.240
 that have loved and lost and murdered and gotten murdered

1:47:11.240 --> 1:47:12.080
 and all that kind of stuff.

1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:14.400
 And it's somehow led to human civilization.

1:47:14.400 --> 1:47:17.120
 We're super busy trying to create things

1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:19.840
 and creating beautiful art, creating beautiful comedy.

1:47:21.460 --> 1:47:23.640
 Just always creating something new.

1:47:23.640 --> 1:47:26.440
 It feels like it's tending towards something, like.

1:47:26.440 --> 1:47:28.560
 It's not dying.

1:47:28.560 --> 1:47:31.800
 If you die tomorrow, you still have all these hours of pods.

1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:33.680
 So it's kind of, you think you're cheating death

1:47:33.680 --> 1:47:35.680
 in a subconscious way, I think.

1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:38.560
 Right, you know who Ernest Becker is and?

1:47:38.560 --> 1:47:39.560
 I've heard the name.

1:47:39.560 --> 1:47:42.080
 It's a book called Denial of Death,

1:47:42.080 --> 1:47:46.320
 this idea that if you don't acknowledge.

1:47:46.320 --> 1:47:47.320
 Books on my shelf.

1:47:48.640 --> 1:47:49.480
 Girls love it.

1:47:49.480 --> 1:47:51.160
 Like Dostoevsky.

1:47:51.160 --> 1:47:53.400
 No, I'm just, I'm saying.

1:47:53.400 --> 1:47:54.960
 You want to bring Tolstoy, Dostoevsky?

1:47:54.960 --> 1:47:57.120
 Russian literature, it's back to norm.

1:47:57.120 --> 1:47:58.760
 It's good to bring to,

1:47:58.760 --> 1:48:02.400
 because no American has read any Russian literature,

1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:04.560
 but they all appreciate it if you bring it.

1:48:04.560 --> 1:48:05.840
 And it's not like they're going to ask you

1:48:05.840 --> 1:48:08.000
 any legitimate questions because they haven't read it.

1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:10.360
 So you can always pretend like you've read it, so.

1:48:10.360 --> 1:48:12.280
 It's a little dense.

1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:14.320
 Can we get a shortened version?

1:48:14.320 --> 1:48:15.160
 Cliff notes.

1:48:15.160 --> 1:48:18.360
 Yes, or make a movie with, you know, Ben Stiller

1:48:18.360 --> 1:48:21.320
 that I can just go, oh, this is based on,

1:48:21.320 --> 1:48:23.280
 what is it, life and death?

1:48:23.280 --> 1:48:24.120
 No, what's the one?

1:48:24.120 --> 1:48:24.960
 War and peace.

1:48:24.960 --> 1:48:26.560
 War and peace, yeah.

1:48:26.560 --> 1:48:28.760
 Yeah, so Ernest Becker's theory,

1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:31.200
 and there's this whole terror management theory

1:48:31.200 --> 1:48:34.480
 that basically says that like our terror of death,

1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:39.040
 our fear of death is one of the central creative forces

1:48:39.040 --> 1:48:40.280
 of the human condition.

1:48:40.280 --> 1:48:43.240
 It's the reason we're trying to, yeah, cheat death.

1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:44.880
 We're trying to dilute ourself

1:48:44.880 --> 1:48:47.520
 that somehow we can become immortal through our art.

1:48:47.520 --> 1:48:49.680
 That's why you've uploaded your special to YouTube

1:48:49.680 --> 1:48:52.320
 because you think your special

1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:54.560
 will outlive all of human civilization.

1:48:54.560 --> 1:48:57.320
 You think YouTube will outlive all of human civilization.

1:48:57.320 --> 1:48:58.560
 That could go away tomorrow.

1:48:58.560 --> 1:49:00.240
 That can go away tomorrow.

1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:01.520
 All of this can go away.

1:49:01.520 --> 1:49:04.320
 So I'm truly grateful.

1:49:04.320 --> 1:49:06.840
 Mr. Mark Norman, that you would spend

1:49:06.840 --> 1:49:09.040
 your very valuable time with me today

1:49:09.040 --> 1:49:10.480
 even though it could all go away.

1:49:10.480 --> 1:49:12.520
 This could be the last day of our lives,

1:49:12.520 --> 1:49:16.280
 and won't you be quite upset that this is how you spent it?

1:49:16.280 --> 1:49:18.880
 Ah, yeah, in your hotel room, what am I?

1:49:18.880 --> 1:49:20.160
 You're like Harvey Weinstein here.

1:49:20.160 --> 1:49:22.280
 You poured me up, and now I feel fucked.

1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:26.040
 Just wait, what we have ready for you

1:49:26.040 --> 1:49:27.400
 after the podcast is over.

1:49:28.400 --> 1:49:29.800
 All right, brother, thanks so much for talking today.

1:49:29.800 --> 1:49:31.480
 Thank you, it was great.

1:49:31.480 --> 1:49:32.320
 Comedy.

1:49:32.320 --> 1:49:36.120
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Mark Norman.

 And now let me leave you with some words

1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:44.640
 from Mark Norman himself on his Twitter,

1:49:44.640 --> 1:49:47.840
 which you should definitely follow because it's hilarious.

1:49:47.840 --> 1:49:51.360
 The worst thing about getting Omicron for Christmas

1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:53.360
 is you know it was regifted.

1:49:53.360 --> 1:50:01.360
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
