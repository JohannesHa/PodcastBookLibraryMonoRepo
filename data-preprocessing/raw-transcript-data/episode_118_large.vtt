00:00.000 --> 00:05.080
 The following is a conversation with Grant Sanderson, his second time on the podcast.

00:05.080 --> 00:10.680
 He's known to millions of people as the mind behind 3Blue1Brown, a YouTube channel where

00:10.680 --> 00:15.940
 he educates and inspires the world with the beauty and power of mathematics.

00:15.940 --> 00:20.140

00:24.560 --> 00:29.120
 especially for the two new sponsors, Dollar Shave Club and DoorDash.

00:29.120 --> 00:33.860
 Let me say, as a side note, I think that this pandemic challenged millions of educators

00:33.860 --> 00:38.640
 to rethink how they teach, to rethink the nature of education.

00:38.640 --> 00:43.820
 As people know, Grant is a master elucidator of mathematical concepts that may otherwise

00:43.820 --> 00:49.160
 seem difficult or out of reach for students and curious minds, but he's also an inspiration

00:49.160 --> 00:53.680
 to teachers, researchers, and people who just enjoy sharing knowledge.

00:53.680 --> 00:56.300
 Like me, for what it's worth.

00:56.300 --> 01:00.520
 It's one thing to give a semester's worth of multi hour lectures, it's another to extract

01:00.520 --> 01:06.000
 from those lectures the most important, interesting, beautiful, and difficult concepts and present

01:06.000 --> 01:09.040
 them in a way that makes everything fall into place.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.480
 That is the challenge that is worth taking on.

01:11.480 --> 01:16.640
 My dream is to see more and more of my colleagues at MIT and world experts across the world

01:16.640 --> 01:22.360
 summon their inner 3Blue1Brown and create the canonical explainer videos on a topic

01:22.360 --> 01:25.960
 that they know more than almost anyone else in the world.

01:25.960 --> 01:30.600
 Amidst the political division, the economic pain, the psychological and medical toll of

01:30.600 --> 01:36.560
 the virus, masterfully crafted educational content feels like one of the beacons of hope

01:36.560 --> 01:37.800
 that we can hold onto.

01:37.800 --> 01:43.440
 If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review it with 5 Stars and Apple Podcasts,

01:43.440 --> 01:48.600

01:48.600 --> 01:52.880
 Of course, after you go immediately, which you already probably have done a long time

01:52.880 --> 01:59.120
 ago, and subscribe to 3Blue1Brown's YouTube channel, you will not regret it.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.000
 As usual, I'll do a few minutes of as now and no ads in the middle.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.980
 I try to make these interesting, but I give you timestamps so you can skip.

02:06.980 --> 02:10.600
 But still, please do check out the sponsors by clicking the links in the description.

02:10.600 --> 02:15.880
 Especially the two new ones, DoorDash and Dollar Shave Club, they're evaluating us,

02:15.880 --> 02:19.320
 looking at how many people go to their site and get their stuff in order to determine

02:19.320 --> 02:22.960
 if they want to support us for the long term, so you know what to do.

02:22.960 --> 02:26.680
 It's the best way to support this podcast, as always.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.960
 This show is sponsored by Dollar Shave Club.

02:36.600 --> 02:41.200
 The starter kit comes with a six blade razor, refills, and all kinds of other stuff that

02:41.200 --> 02:43.160
 makes shaving feel great.

02:43.160 --> 02:47.040
 I've been a member of Dollar Shave Club for over five years now, and actually signed up

02:47.040 --> 02:53.080
 when I first heard about them on the Joe Rogan podcast, and now we have come full circle.

02:53.080 --> 02:57.720
 I feel like I've made it, now that I can do a read for them just like Joe did all those

02:57.720 --> 02:58.720
 years ago.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.360
 For the most part, I've just used the razor and the refills, but they encouraged me to

03:02.360 --> 03:07.880
 try the shave butter, which I've never used before, so I did, and I love it.

03:07.880 --> 03:11.920
 Not sure how the chemistry of it works out, but it's translucent somehow, which is a

03:11.920 --> 03:13.400
 cool new experience.

03:13.400 --> 03:19.520

03:21.440 --> 03:24.480
 This show is also sponsored by DoorDash.

03:24.480 --> 03:29.520
 Get $5 off and zero delivery fees on your first order of $15 or more when you download

03:29.520 --> 03:32.440
 the DoorDash app and enter code LEX.

03:32.440 --> 03:37.640
 I have so many memories of working late nights for a deadline with a team of engineers and

03:37.640 --> 03:42.160
 eventually taking a break to argue about which DoorDash restaurant to order from, and when

03:42.160 --> 03:48.280
 the food came, those moments of bonding, of exchanging ideas, of pausing to shift attention

03:48.280 --> 03:53.180
 from the programs to the humans were special.

03:53.180 --> 03:58.360
 These days, for a bit of time, I'm on my own, sadly, so I miss that camaraderie.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.640
 But actually DoorDash is still there for me.

04:00.640 --> 04:04.320
 There's a million options that fit into my keto diet ways.

04:04.320 --> 04:07.800
 Also it's a great way to support restaurants in these challenging times.

04:07.800 --> 04:13.020
 Once again, download the DoorDash app and enter code LEX to get $5 off and zero delivery

04:13.020 --> 04:16.520
 fees on your first order of $15 or more.

04:16.520 --> 04:21.760
 Finally, this show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.

04:21.760 --> 04:24.760
 When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST.

04:24.760 --> 04:28.940
 Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with

04:28.940 --> 04:31.040
 as little as $1.

04:31.040 --> 04:34.760
 It's one of the best design interfaces of an app that I've ever used.

04:34.760 --> 04:38.280
 To me, good design is when everything is easy and natural.

04:38.280 --> 04:42.640
 Bad design is when the app gets in the way either because it's buggy or because it tries

04:42.640 --> 04:44.880
 too hard to be helpful.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.360
 I'm looking at you, Clippy.

04:46.360 --> 04:50.400
 Anyway, there's a big part of my brain and heart that love to design things and also

04:50.400 --> 04:52.800
 to appreciate great design by others.

04:52.800 --> 04:57.920
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use code LEX PODCAST,

04:57.920 --> 05:03.200
 you get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, an organization that is helping

05:03.200 --> 05:08.560
 to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world.

05:08.560 --> 05:13.880
 And now here's my conversation with Grant Sanderson.

05:13.880 --> 05:17.360
 You've spoken about Richard Feynman as someone you admire.

05:17.360 --> 05:21.420
 I think last time we spoke, we ran out of time.

05:21.420 --> 05:24.760
 So I wanted to talk to you about him.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.280
 Who is Richard Feynman to you in your eyes?

05:27.280 --> 05:29.400
 What impact did he have on you?

05:29.400 --> 05:31.800
 I mean, I think a ton of people like Feynman.

05:31.800 --> 05:34.280
 It's a little bit cliche to say that you like Feynman, right?

05:34.280 --> 05:38.720
 That's almost like when you don't know what to say about sports and you just point to

05:38.720 --> 05:41.320
 the Super Bowl or something or something you enjoy watching.

05:41.320 --> 05:45.600
 But I do actually think there's a layer to Feynman that sits behind the iconography.

05:45.600 --> 05:50.540
 One thing that just really struck me was this letter that he wrote to his wife two years

05:50.540 --> 05:51.780
 after she died.

05:51.780 --> 05:54.320
 So during the Manhattan Project, she had polio.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.500
 Tragically she died.

05:55.500 --> 05:58.080
 They were just young, madly in love.

05:58.080 --> 06:06.000
 And the icon of Feynman is almost this mildly sexist, womanizing philanderer, at least on

06:06.000 --> 06:08.160
 the personal side.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.840
 But you read this letter, and I can try to pull it up for you if I want.

06:10.840 --> 06:15.840
 And it's just this absolutely heartfelt letter to his wife saying how much he loves her even

06:15.840 --> 06:21.760
 though she's dead and what she means to him, how no woman can ever measure up to her.

06:21.760 --> 06:26.820
 And it shows you that the Feynman that we've all seen in Surely You're Joking is different

06:26.820 --> 06:28.860
 from the Feynman in reality.

06:28.860 --> 06:35.340
 And I think the same kind of goes in his science, where he sometimes has this output of being

06:35.340 --> 06:39.960
 this aw shucks character, like everyone else is coming in with these fancyfalutin formulas,

06:39.960 --> 06:43.240
 but I'm just going to try to whittle it down to its essentials, which is so appealing because

06:43.240 --> 06:45.120
 we love to see that kind of thing.

06:45.120 --> 06:52.060
 But when you get into it, what he was doing was actually quite deep, very much mathematical.

06:52.060 --> 06:55.160
 That should go without saying, but I remember reading a book about Feynman in a cafe once,

06:55.160 --> 06:58.720
 and this woman looked at me and saw that it was about Feynman.

06:58.720 --> 06:59.720
 She was like, oh, I love him.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.220
 I read Surely You're Joking.

07:01.220 --> 07:04.880
 And she started explaining to me how he was never really a math person.

07:04.880 --> 07:10.040
 And I don't understand how that can possibly be a public perception about any physicist,

07:10.040 --> 07:14.660
 but for whatever reason, that worked into his art that he shooed off math in place of

07:14.660 --> 07:15.660
 true science.

07:15.660 --> 07:18.880
 The reality of it is he was deeply in love with math and was much more going in that

07:18.880 --> 07:22.880
 direction and had a clicking point into seeing that physics was a way to realize that and

07:22.880 --> 07:27.560
 all the creativity that he could output in that direction was instead poured towards

07:27.560 --> 07:31.680
 things like fundamental, not even fundamental theories, just emergent phenomena and everything

07:31.680 --> 07:32.760
 like that.

07:32.760 --> 07:37.880
 So to answer your actual question, like what, what, what I like about, uh, his way of going

07:37.880 --> 07:42.320
 at things is this constant desire to reinvent it for himself.

07:42.320 --> 07:45.320
 Like when he would consume papers, the way he'd describe it, he's, he would start to

07:45.320 --> 07:48.340
 see what problem he was trying to solve and then just try to solve it himself to get a

07:48.340 --> 07:50.040
 sense of personal ownership.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.560
 And then from there, see what others had done.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.120
 Is that how you see problems yourself?

07:54.120 --> 08:00.360
 Like that's actually an interesting point when you first are inspired by a certain idea

08:00.360 --> 08:05.040
 that you maybe want to teach or visualize or just explore on your own.

08:05.040 --> 08:08.420
 I'm sure you're captured by some possibility and magic of it.

08:08.420 --> 08:10.600
 Do you read the work of others?

08:10.600 --> 08:15.000
 Like do you go through the proofs or do you try to rediscover everything yourself?

08:15.000 --> 08:19.120
 So I think the things that I've learned best and have the deepest ownership of are the

08:19.120 --> 08:21.200
 ones that have some element of rediscovery.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.260
 The problem is that really slows you down.

08:23.260 --> 08:25.400
 And this is for my, for my part, it's actually a big fault.

08:25.400 --> 08:28.240
 Like this is part of why I'm, I'm not an active researcher.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.880
 I'm not like at the depth of the field.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.160
 A lot of other people are the stuff that I do learn.

08:32.160 --> 08:33.880
 I try to learn it really well.

08:33.880 --> 08:37.480
 Um, but other times you do need to get through it at a certain pace.

08:37.480 --> 08:39.680
 You do need to get to a point of a problem you're trying to solve.

08:39.680 --> 08:43.940
 So obviously you need to be well equipped to read things, uh, without that reinvention

08:43.940 --> 08:45.960
 component and see how others have done it.

08:45.960 --> 08:49.080
 But I think if you choose a few core building blocks along the way and you say, I'm really

08:49.080 --> 08:54.920
 going to try to approach this, um, before I see how this person went at it, I'm really

08:54.920 --> 08:56.880
 going to try to approach it for myself.

08:56.880 --> 09:02.020
 No matter what you gain, all sorts of inarticulatable intuitions about that topic, which aren't

09:02.020 --> 09:03.020
 going to be there.

09:03.020 --> 09:06.600
 If you simply go through the proof, for example, you're going to be, um, trying to come up

09:06.600 --> 09:07.880
 with counter examples.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.920
 You're going to try to come up with, um, intuitive examples, all sorts of things where you're

09:11.920 --> 09:13.560
 populating your brain with data.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.120
 And the ones that you come up with are likely to be different than the one that the text

09:16.120 --> 09:19.240
 comes up with and that like lends at a different angle.

09:19.240 --> 09:22.640
 So that aspect also slowed Feynman down in a lot of respects.

09:22.640 --> 09:26.480
 I think there was a period when like the rest of physics was running away from him.

09:26.480 --> 09:32.240
 Um, but in so far as got, it got him to where he was, uh, I, I kind of resonate with that.

09:32.240 --> 09:37.240
 I just, I would, I would be nowhere near it cause I not like him at all, but it's like

09:37.240 --> 09:41.360
 a, uh, state to aspire to.

09:41.360 --> 09:46.800
 You know, just to link in a small point you made that you're not a quote unquote active

09:46.800 --> 09:55.400
 researcher, do you, you're swimming often in reasonably good depth about a lot of topics.

09:55.400 --> 10:01.280
 Do you sometimes want to like dive deep at a certain moment and say, like, cause you

10:01.280 --> 10:07.080
 probably built up a hell of an amazing intuition about what is and isn't true within these

10:07.080 --> 10:08.080
 worlds.

10:08.080 --> 10:14.000
 Do you ever want to just dive in and see if you can discover something new?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
 Yeah.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.440
 I, I think one of my biggest regrets from undergrad is not having built better relationships

10:20.440 --> 10:21.800
 with the professors I had there.

10:21.800 --> 10:26.400
 And I think a big part of success and research is that element of like mentorship and like

10:26.400 --> 10:30.760
 people giving you the kind of scaffolded problems to carry along for my own like goals right

10:30.760 --> 10:31.760
 now.

10:31.760 --> 10:37.320
 I feel like, um, I'm pretty good at exposing math to others and like want to continue doing

10:37.320 --> 10:39.800
 that for my personal learning.

10:39.800 --> 10:44.720
 I, are you familiar with like the hedgehog Fox dynamic?

10:44.720 --> 10:50.280
 I think this was, um, either the ancient Greeks came up with it or it was pretended to be

10:50.280 --> 10:53.560
 something drawn from the ancient Greeks that I don't know who to point it to, but the probably

10:53.560 --> 10:54.560
 Mark Twain.

10:54.560 --> 10:59.400
 It is that you've got two types of people or especially two types of researchers.

10:59.400 --> 11:03.140
 There's the Fox that knows many different things and then the hedgehog that knows one

11:03.140 --> 11:04.700
 thing very deeply.

11:04.700 --> 11:06.840
 So like von Neumann would have been the Fox.

11:06.840 --> 11:10.040
 Obviously someone who knows many different things, just very foundational, a lot of different

11:10.040 --> 11:11.040
 fields.

11:11.040 --> 11:14.240
 Um, Einstein would have been more of a hedge thinking really deeply about one particular

11:14.240 --> 11:17.520
 thing and both are very necessary for making progress.

11:17.520 --> 11:22.600
 Um, so between those two, I would definitely see myself as like the Fox where, uh, I'll

11:22.600 --> 11:24.720
 try to get my pause in like a whole bunch of different things.

11:24.720 --> 11:28.660
 And at the moment I just think I don't know enough of anything to make like a significant

11:28.660 --> 11:30.080
 contribution to any of them.

11:30.080 --> 11:36.760
 But I do see value in, um, like having a decently deep understanding of a wide variety of things.

11:36.760 --> 11:42.200
 Like most people who, uh, know computer science really deeply don't necessarily know physics

11:42.200 --> 11:47.120
 very deeply or, uh, many of the aspects, like different fields in math, even let's say you

11:47.120 --> 11:49.760
 have like an analytic number theory versus an algebraic number theory.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.440
 Like these two things end up being related to very different fields.

11:52.440 --> 11:56.240
 Like some of them more complex analysis, some of them more like algebraic geometry.

11:56.240 --> 12:00.000
 And then when you just go out so far as to take those adjacent fields, place one, you

12:00.000 --> 12:03.040
 know, PhD student into a seminar of another ones, they don't understand what the other

12:03.040 --> 12:04.040
 one's saying at all.

12:04.040 --> 12:08.480
 Like you take the complex analysis specialist inside the algebraic geometry seminar, they're

12:08.480 --> 12:10.320
 as lost as you or I would be.

12:10.320 --> 12:14.320
 But I think, uh, going around and like trying to have some sense of what this big picture

12:14.320 --> 12:16.560
 is certainly has personal value for me.

12:16.560 --> 12:20.880
 I don't know if I would ever make like new contributions in those fields, but I do think

12:20.880 --> 12:26.600
 I could make new like expositional contributions where there's kind of a notion of, uh, things

12:26.600 --> 12:29.400
 that are known, but like haven't been explained very well.

12:29.400 --> 12:34.600
 Well, first of all, I think most people would agree your videos, your teaching the way you

12:34.600 --> 12:42.040
 see the world is fundamentally often new, like you're creating something new and it

12:42.040 --> 12:47.280
 almost feels like research, even just like the visualizations, uh, the multidimensional

12:47.280 --> 12:48.480
 visualization we'll talk about.

12:48.480 --> 12:54.840
 I mean, you're revealing something very interesting that, uh, yeah, just feels like research feels

12:54.840 --> 13:01.440
 like science feels like the cutting edge of the very thing of which like new ideas and

13:01.440 --> 13:03.160
 new discoveries are made of.

13:03.160 --> 13:06.800
 I do think you're being a little bit more generous than is necessarily.

13:06.800 --> 13:10.960
 And I promise that's not even false humility because I sometimes think when I research

13:10.960 --> 13:14.320
 a video, I'll learn like 10 times as much as I need for the video itself and it ends

13:14.320 --> 13:15.960
 up feeling kind of elementary.

13:15.960 --> 13:20.960
 Um, so I have a sense of just how far away like the stuff that I cover is from the actual

13:20.960 --> 13:22.440
 depth.

13:22.440 --> 13:26.320
 I think that's natural, but I think that could also be a mathematics thing.

13:26.320 --> 13:30.680
 I feel like in the machine learning world, you like two weeks in, you feel like you've

13:30.680 --> 13:34.040
 basically mastered in mathematics.

13:34.040 --> 13:37.520
 It's like, well, everything is either trivial or impossible.

13:37.520 --> 13:41.200
 And it's like a shockingly thin line between the two where you can find something that's

13:41.200 --> 13:42.200
 totally impenetrable.

13:42.200 --> 13:45.880
 And then after you get a feel for it, it's like, Oh yeah, that whole, that whole subject

13:45.880 --> 13:48.180
 is actually trivial in some way.

13:48.180 --> 13:50.360
 So maybe that's what goes on.

13:50.360 --> 13:53.240
 Every researcher is just on the other end of that hump and it feels like it's so far

13:53.240 --> 13:56.120
 away, but one step actually gets them there.

13:56.120 --> 14:02.720
 What do you think about, uh, sort of Feynman's teaching style or another perspective of use

14:02.720 --> 14:05.720
 of visualization?

14:05.720 --> 14:09.640
 Well his teaching style is interesting because people have described like the Feynman effect

14:09.640 --> 14:13.520
 where while you're watching his lectures or while he reading his lectures, everything

14:13.520 --> 14:15.420
 makes such perfect sense.

14:15.420 --> 14:21.920
 So as an entertainment session, it's wonderful because it gives you this, um, this intellectual

14:21.920 --> 14:26.440
 satisfaction that you don't get from anywhere else that you like finally understand it.

14:26.440 --> 14:31.080
 But the Feynman effect is that you can't really recall what it is that gave you that insight,

14:31.080 --> 14:32.680
 you know, even a week later.

14:32.680 --> 14:36.640
 And this is, um, this is true of a lot of books and a lot of lectures where the retention

14:36.640 --> 14:38.760
 is never quite what we hope it is.

14:38.760 --> 14:46.680
 Um, so there is a risk that, uh, the stuff that I do also fits that same bill where at

14:46.680 --> 14:50.320
 best it's giving this kind of intellectual candy on giving a glimpse of feeling like

14:50.320 --> 14:55.040
 you understand something, but unless you do something active, like reinventing it yourself,

14:55.040 --> 15:00.280
 like doing problems, um, to solidify it, um, even things like space repetition memory to

15:00.280 --> 15:04.420
 just make sure that you have like the building blocks of what do all the terms mean.

15:04.420 --> 15:07.080
 Unless you're doing something like that, it's not actually going to stick.

15:07.080 --> 15:12.720
 So the very same thing that's so admirable about Feynman's lectures, which is how damn

15:12.720 --> 15:18.680
 satisfying they are to consume might actually also reveal a little bit of the flaw that

15:18.680 --> 15:22.840
 we should as educators all look out for, which is that that does not correlate with long

15:22.840 --> 15:23.840
 term learning.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.600
 We'll talk about it a little bit.

15:25.600 --> 15:28.280
 I think you've done some interactive stuff.

15:28.280 --> 15:34.960
 I mean, even in your videos, the awesome thing that Feynman couldn't do at the time is you

15:34.960 --> 15:40.840
 could, since it's programmed, you can like tinker, like play with stuff.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.760
 You could take this value and change it.

15:42.760 --> 15:47.720
 You can like heroes, take the value of this variable and change it to build up an intuition,

15:47.720 --> 15:51.960
 to move along the surface or to, to change the shape of something.

15:51.960 --> 15:57.120
 I think that's almost an equivalent of you doing it yourself.

15:57.120 --> 16:02.040
 It's not quite there, but you as a viewer, um, yeah, do you think there's some value

16:02.040 --> 16:04.000
 in that interactive element?

16:04.000 --> 16:08.280
 Yeah, well, so what's interesting is you're saying that, and the videos are non interactive

16:08.280 --> 16:10.520
 in the sense that there's a play button and a pause button.

16:10.520 --> 16:13.940
 Um, and you could ask like, Hey, while you're programming these things, why don't you program

16:13.940 --> 16:15.880
 it into an interactable version?

16:15.880 --> 16:19.320
 You know, make it a Jupiter notebook that people can play with, which I should do.

16:19.320 --> 16:20.760
 And that like would be better.

16:20.760 --> 16:25.440
 I think the thing about interactives though is most people consuming them, um, just sort

16:25.440 --> 16:27.520
 of consume what the author had in mind.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.680
 Uh, and that's kind of what they want.

16:29.680 --> 16:33.360
 Like I have a ton of friends who make interactive explanations.

16:33.360 --> 16:37.800
 And when you look into the analytics of how people use them, there's a small sliver that

16:37.800 --> 16:40.360
 genuinely use it as a playground to have experiments.

16:40.360 --> 16:43.520
 And maybe that small sliver is actually who you're targeting and the rest don't matter.

16:43.520 --> 16:48.580
 Um, but most people consume it just as a piece of, um, like well constructed literature that

16:48.580 --> 16:51.960
 maybe you tweak with the example a little bit to see what it's getting at.

16:51.960 --> 16:56.760
 But in that way, I do think like a video can get most of the benefits of the interactive,

16:56.760 --> 17:01.160
 like the interactive app, as long as you make the interactive for yourself and you decide

17:01.160 --> 17:03.480
 what the best narrative to spin is.

17:03.480 --> 17:08.600
 Um, as a more concrete example, like my process with, I made this video about, um, SIR models

17:08.600 --> 17:13.660
 for epidemics and it's like this agent based bottling thing where you tweak some things

17:13.660 --> 17:17.360
 about how the epidemic spreads and you want to see how that affects its evolution.

17:17.360 --> 17:21.720
 Um, my, my, uh, format for making that was very different than others where rather than

17:21.720 --> 17:26.800
 scripting it ahead of time, I just made the playground and then I played a bunch, uh,

17:26.800 --> 17:29.480
 and then I saw what stories there were to tell within that.

17:29.480 --> 17:30.480
 Um,

17:30.480 --> 17:31.480
 that's cool.

17:31.480 --> 17:36.040
 So your, your video had that kind of structure, it had, uh, like five or six stories or whatever

17:36.040 --> 17:37.160
 it was.

17:37.160 --> 17:42.040
 And like, it was basically, okay, here's a simulation, here's a model.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.440
 What can we discover with this model?

17:44.440 --> 17:46.960
 And here's five things I found after playing with it.

17:46.960 --> 17:51.080
 Well, cause here, the thing is a way that you could do that project is you make the

17:51.080 --> 17:54.640
 model and then you put it out and you say, here's a thing for the world to play with,

17:54.640 --> 17:57.160
 like come to my website where you interact with this thing.

17:57.160 --> 18:01.560
 Um, and, and people did like sort of remake it in a, um, JavaScript way so that you can

18:01.560 --> 18:04.720
 go to that website and you can test your own hypotheses.

18:04.720 --> 18:08.640
 But I think a meaningful part of the value to add is not just the technology, but to

18:08.640 --> 18:11.000
 give the story around it as well.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.960
 And like, that's kind of my job.

18:12.960 --> 18:17.680
 It's not just to like make the, uh, the visuals that someone will look at it's to be the one

18:17.680 --> 18:20.320
 to decide what's the interesting thing to walk through here.

18:20.320 --> 18:24.280
 Um, and even though there's lots of other interesting paths that one could take, that

18:24.280 --> 18:27.120
 can be kind of daunting when you're just sitting there in a sandbox and you're given this

18:27.120 --> 18:32.240
 tool with like five different sliders and you're told to like play and discover things.

18:32.240 --> 18:33.240
 Where do you do?

18:33.240 --> 18:34.240
 What do you start?

18:34.240 --> 18:35.240
 What are my hypotheses?

18:35.240 --> 18:36.240
 What should I be asking?

18:36.240 --> 18:40.040
 Like a little bit of guidance in that direction can be what actually sparks curiosity to make

18:40.040 --> 18:43.120
 someone want to, um, imagine more about it.

18:43.120 --> 18:47.720
 A few videos I've seen you do, I don't know how often you do it, but there's almost a

18:47.720 --> 18:54.280
 tangential like pause where you, here's a cool thing you say like, here's a cool thing,

18:54.280 --> 18:59.560
 but it's outside the scope of this video essentially, but I'll leave it to you as homework essentially

18:59.560 --> 19:02.760
 to like figure out it's a cool thing to explore.

19:02.760 --> 19:06.960
 I wish I could say that wasn't a function of laziness and that's like, you've worked

19:06.960 --> 19:11.320
 so hard on making the 20 minutes already that to extend it out even further, it would take

19:11.320 --> 19:12.320
 more time.

19:12.320 --> 19:19.640
 And one of your cooler videos, the homomorphic, like from the Mobius strip to this, yeah,

19:19.640 --> 19:26.160
 that's the super and you're like, yeah, you can't, uh, you can't transform the Mobius

19:26.160 --> 19:35.800
 strip into a, into a surface without it intersecting itself, but I'll leave it to you to see why

19:35.800 --> 19:36.800
 that is.

19:36.800 --> 19:41.240
 Well, I hope that's not exactly how I phrase it because I think what my hope would be is

19:41.240 --> 19:45.280
 that I leave it to you to think about why you would expect that to be true and then

19:45.280 --> 19:50.040
 to want to know what aspects of a Mobius strip do you want to formalize such that you can

19:50.040 --> 19:55.160
 prove that intuition that you have because at some point now you're starting to invent

19:55.160 --> 19:56.840
 algebraic topology.

19:56.840 --> 20:02.160
 If you have these vague instincts like I want to get this Mobius strip, I want to, um, fit

20:02.160 --> 20:08.120
 it such that it's all above the plane, but it's boundary sits exactly on the plane.

20:08.120 --> 20:11.320
 I don't think I can do that without crossing itself, but that feels really vague.

20:11.320 --> 20:12.320
 How do I formalize it?

20:12.320 --> 20:16.480
 And as you're starting to formalize that, that's what's going to get you to try to come

20:16.480 --> 20:19.760
 up with a definition for what it means to be orientable or non orientable.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.920
 And like once you have that motivation, a lot of the otherwise arbitrary things that

20:22.920 --> 20:26.560
 are sitting at the very beginning of a topology stack textbook start to make a little more

20:26.560 --> 20:27.560
 sense.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.560
 Yeah.

20:28.560 --> 20:32.400
 And I mean that, that whole video beautifully was a motivation for topology school.

20:32.400 --> 20:36.400
 That was my, well, my hope with that is I feel like topology is, um, I don't want to

20:36.400 --> 20:41.920
 say it's taught wrong, but I do think sometimes it's popularized in the wrong way where, uh,

20:41.920 --> 20:44.920
 you know, you'll hear these things that people saying, Oh, topologists, they're very interested

20:44.920 --> 20:50.180
 in surfaces that you can bend and stretch, but you can't cut or glue.

20:50.180 --> 20:51.180
 Are they?

20:51.180 --> 20:52.180
 Why?

20:52.180 --> 20:53.180
 Yeah.

20:53.180 --> 20:56.780
 There's all sorts of things you can be interested in with random, like imaginative manipulations

20:56.780 --> 20:57.780
 of things.

20:57.780 --> 21:00.200
 Is that really what like mathematicians are into?

21:00.200 --> 21:03.120
 And the short answer is not, not really.

21:03.120 --> 21:07.580
 That's uh, it's not as if someone was sitting there thinking like, I wonder what the properties

21:07.580 --> 21:12.120
 of clay are by add some arbitrary rules about what, when I can't cut it and when I can't

21:12.120 --> 21:18.680
 glue it instead, it's, there's a ton of pieces of math that, um, can actually be equivalent

21:18.680 --> 21:23.200
 to, uh, like these very general structures that's like geometry, except you don't have

21:23.200 --> 21:24.200
 exact distances.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.400
 You just want to maintain a notion of closeness.

21:26.400 --> 21:31.400
 And once you get it to those general structures, constructing mappings between them translate

21:31.400 --> 21:36.360
 into non trivial facts about other parts of math and that I just, I don't think that's

21:36.360 --> 21:38.040
 actually like popularized.

21:38.040 --> 21:41.640
 Um, I don't even think it's emphasized well enough when you're starting to take a topology

21:41.640 --> 21:43.560
 class because you kind of have these two problems.

21:43.560 --> 21:45.320
 It's like either it's too squishy.

21:45.320 --> 21:49.720
 You're just talking about coffee mugs and donuts, or it's a little bit too rigor first.

21:49.720 --> 21:55.280
 And you're talking about, um, the axiom systems with open sets and an open set is not the

21:55.280 --> 21:56.600
 opposite of closed set.

21:56.600 --> 21:57.600
 So sorry about that.

21:57.600 --> 22:01.800
 Everyone, we have a notion of clopin sets for ones that are both at the same time.

22:01.800 --> 22:02.800
 Yeah.

22:02.800 --> 22:06.860
 It's just, it's not, it's not an intuitive axiom system in comparison to other fields

22:06.860 --> 22:07.860
 of math.

22:07.860 --> 22:11.140
 So you as the student like really have to walk through mud to get there and you're constantly

22:11.140 --> 22:15.240
 confused about how this relates to the beautiful things about coffee mugs and Mobius strips

22:15.240 --> 22:16.240
 and such.

22:16.240 --> 22:21.140
 And it takes a really long time to actually see like see topology in the way that mathematicians

22:21.140 --> 22:22.400
 see topology.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.840
 But I don't think it needs to take that time.

22:23.840 --> 22:27.800
 I think there's, um, this is making me feel like I need to make more videos on the topic

22:27.800 --> 22:32.760
 because I think you do, but you know, I've also seen it in my narrow view.

22:32.760 --> 22:39.840
 Uh, like, um, I find game theory very beautiful and I know topology has been used, uh, elegantly

22:39.840 --> 22:41.320
 to prove things in game theory.

22:41.320 --> 22:42.320
 Yeah.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.760
 You have like facts that seem very strange.

22:43.760 --> 22:47.920
 Like I could tell you, you stir your coffee and um, after you stir it and like, let's

22:47.920 --> 22:51.040
 say all the molecules settled to like not moving again, one of the molecules will be

22:51.040 --> 22:53.360
 basically in the same position it was before.

22:53.360 --> 22:57.200
 Um, you have all sorts of fixed point theorems like this, right?

22:57.200 --> 23:01.320
 That kind of fixed point theorem directly relevant to Nash equilibriums, right?

23:01.320 --> 23:05.680
 Um, so you can imagine popularizing it by describing the coffee fact, but then you're

23:05.680 --> 23:09.160
 left to wonder like who cares about if a molecule of coffee like stays in the same spot?

23:09.160 --> 23:11.160
 Is this what we're paying our mathematicians for?

23:11.160 --> 23:15.640
 Um, you have this very elegant mapping onto economics in a way that's very concrete or

23:15.640 --> 23:20.240
 very, I shouldn't say concrete, very, uh, tangible, like actually adds value to people's

23:20.240 --> 23:22.320
 lives through the predictions that it makes.

23:22.320 --> 23:26.780
 Uh, but that line isn't always drawn because like you have to get a little bit technical

23:26.780 --> 23:34.160
 in order to properly draw that line out, um, and often I think popularized forms of media

23:34.160 --> 23:37.760
 just shy away from being a little too technical for sure.

23:37.760 --> 23:41.840
 Uh, by the way, for people who are watching the video, I do not condone the message in

23:41.840 --> 23:42.840
 this mug.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.760
 It's the only one I have, which is this.

23:44.760 --> 23:47.360
 The snuggle is real.

23:47.360 --> 23:50.240
 By the way, for anyone watching, I do condone the message of that mug.

23:50.240 --> 23:51.240
 The snuggle is real.

23:51.240 --> 23:52.240
 The snuggle is real.

23:52.240 --> 23:57.160
 Okay, so you mentioned the SIR model.

23:57.160 --> 24:03.220
 I think, uh, there are certain ideas there of growth of exponential growth.

24:03.220 --> 24:11.680
 What maybe have you learned about, um, pandemics from, from making that video?

24:11.680 --> 24:12.680
 Because it was kind of exploratory.

24:12.680 --> 24:17.680
 You were kind of building up an intuition and it's, again, people should watch the video.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.160
 It's kind of an abstract view.

24:19.160 --> 24:23.480
 It's not really modeling in detail.

24:23.480 --> 24:31.440
 The whole field of epidemiology, those, those people, they go really far in terms of modeling,

24:31.440 --> 24:32.440
 like how people move about.

24:32.440 --> 24:37.600
 I don't know if you've seen it, but like there is the mobility patterns, like how, like the

24:37.600 --> 24:42.560
 track, like how many people you encounter in a certain situations when you go to a school,

24:42.560 --> 24:46.400
 when you go to a mall, they like model every aspect of that for a particular city.

24:46.400 --> 24:49.880
 Like they have maps of actual city streets.

24:49.880 --> 24:54.280
 They model it really well and natural patterns of the people have it's crazy.

24:54.280 --> 24:55.280
 So you don't do any of that.

24:55.280 --> 24:59.400
 You're just doing an abstract model to explore different ideas of simple pedigree.

24:59.400 --> 25:02.680
 Well, because I don't want to pretend like an epidemiologist, I'm an epidemiologist.

25:02.680 --> 25:08.440
 Like we have a ton of armchair epidemiologists and the spirit of that was more like, uh,

25:08.440 --> 25:12.680
 can we through a little bit of play, uh, draw like reasonable ish conclusions.

25:12.680 --> 25:17.680
 Um, and also just like, uh, get ourselves in a position where we can judge the validity

25:17.680 --> 25:18.680
 of a model.

25:18.680 --> 25:21.160
 Like, I think people should look at that and they should criticize it.

25:21.160 --> 25:24.640
 They should point to all the ways that it's wrong because it's definitely naive, right?

25:24.640 --> 25:25.920
 And the way that it's set up.

25:25.920 --> 25:30.480
 Um, but to say like what, what lessons from that hold, like thinking about the are not

25:30.480 --> 25:33.720
 value and what that represents and what it can imply.

25:33.720 --> 25:40.440
 Um, so are not is if you are infectious and you're in a population which is completely

25:40.440 --> 25:44.760
 susceptible, uh, what's the average number of people that you're going to infect during

25:44.760 --> 25:46.080
 your infectiousness?

25:46.080 --> 25:51.280
 Um, so certainly during the beginning of an epidemic, this basically gives you kind of

25:51.280 --> 25:53.280
 the, um, the exponential growth rate.

25:53.280 --> 25:57.280
 Like if every person infects two others, you've got that one, two, four, eight, uh, exponential

25:57.280 --> 25:58.280
 growth pattern.

25:58.280 --> 26:04.280
 Um, as it goes on and, uh, let's say it's something, um, uh, endemic where you've got

26:04.280 --> 26:10.040
 like a ton of people who have had it, uh, and are recovered, then, uh, you, you would,

26:10.040 --> 26:13.960
 the are not value doesn't tell you that as directly because a lot of the people you interact

26:13.960 --> 26:16.880
 with aren't susceptible, but in the early phases it does.

26:16.880 --> 26:21.360
 Um, and this is like the fundamental constant that it seems like epidemiologists look at

26:21.360 --> 26:23.460
 and you know, the whole goal is to get that down.

26:23.460 --> 26:26.560
 If you can get it below one, then it's no longer epidemic.

26:26.560 --> 26:30.960
 If it's equal to one, then it's endemic, um, and it's above one, then your epidemic.

26:30.960 --> 26:36.120
 So, uh, like just teaching what that value is and giving some intuitions on how do certain

26:36.120 --> 26:40.160
 changes in behavior change that value and then what does that imply for exponential

26:40.160 --> 26:41.160
 growth?

26:41.160 --> 26:47.140
 I think those are, um, general enough lessons and they're like resilient to all of the

26:47.140 --> 26:52.400
 chaoses of the world, um, that it's still like valid to take from the video.

26:52.400 --> 26:56.040
 I mean, one of the interesting aspects of that is just exponential growth and we think

26:56.040 --> 26:57.040
 about growth.

26:57.040 --> 27:03.480
 Is that the one of the first times you've done a video on, on, uh, no, of course not

27:03.480 --> 27:07.360
 the whole, uh, well there's identity.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.360
 Okay.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.360
 So

27:09.360 --> 27:10.360
 sure.

27:10.360 --> 27:13.360
 I guess I've done a lot of videos about exponential growth in the circular direction, uh, only

27:13.360 --> 27:14.880
 minimal in the normal direction.

27:14.880 --> 27:22.280
 I mean, another way to ask, like, do you think we're able to reason intuitively about exponential

27:22.280 --> 27:23.280
 growth?

27:23.280 --> 27:25.360
 It's, it's funny.

27:25.360 --> 27:30.360
 I think it's, um, I think it's extremely intuitive to humans and then we train it out of ourselves

27:30.360 --> 27:33.720
 such that it's then really not intuitive and then I think it can become intuitive again

27:33.720 --> 27:35.200
 when you study a technical field.

27:35.200 --> 27:41.240
 Uh, so what I mean by that is, um, have you ever heard of these studies where in a, uh,

27:41.240 --> 27:46.000
 like anthropological setting where you're studying a group that has been disassociated

27:46.000 --> 27:51.760
 from a lot of like modern society and you ask what number is between one and nine and

27:51.760 --> 27:54.600
 maybe you would ask you, you've got like one rock and you've got nine rocks, you're like

27:54.600 --> 27:59.960
 what pile is halfway in between these and our instinct is usually to say five.

27:59.960 --> 28:02.000
 That's the number that sits right between one and nine.

28:02.000 --> 28:07.360
 Um, but sometimes when a numeracy and, uh, the kind of just basic arithmetic that we

28:07.360 --> 28:12.840
 have isn't in a society, the natural instinct is three because it's, uh, in between in an

28:12.840 --> 28:16.920
 exponential sense and a geometric sense that, uh, one is three times bigger and then the

28:16.920 --> 28:18.520
 next one is three times bigger than that.

28:18.520 --> 28:22.240
 So it's like, what's, you know, if you have one friend versus a hundred friends, what's

28:22.240 --> 28:23.240
 in between that?

28:23.240 --> 28:26.840
 Ten friends seems like the social status in between those two states.

28:26.840 --> 28:30.200
 So that's like deeply intuitive to us to think logarithmically like that.

28:30.200 --> 28:35.120
 Um, and for some reason we kind of train it out of ourselves to start thinking linearly

28:35.120 --> 28:36.120
 about things.

28:36.120 --> 28:42.240
 So in the sense, yeah, the early, early basic math is, uh, yeah, forces us to take a step

28:42.240 --> 28:43.240
 back.

28:43.240 --> 28:51.160
 It's, it's the same criticism if there's any of science is the lessons of science make

28:51.160 --> 28:57.760
 us like see the world in a slightly narrow sense to where we, we have an over exaggerated

28:57.760 --> 29:02.480
 confidence that we understand everything as opposed to just understanding a small slice

29:02.480 --> 29:03.560
 of it.

29:03.560 --> 29:07.280
 But I think that probably only really goes for small numbers cause the real counterintuitive

29:07.280 --> 29:10.340
 thing about exponential growth is like as the numbers start to get big.

29:10.340 --> 29:14.660
 So I bet if you took that same setup and you asked them, oh, if I keep tripling the size

29:14.660 --> 29:18.320
 of this rock pile, you know, um, seven times, how big will it be?

29:18.320 --> 29:23.680
 I bet it would be surprisingly big even to like an a society without numeracy.

29:23.680 --> 29:28.360
 And that's the side of it that, um, I think is pretty counterintuitive to us, uh, but

29:28.360 --> 29:33.320
 that you can basically train into people like I think computer scientists and physicists

29:33.320 --> 29:38.520
 when they're looking at the early numbers of, um, like COVID were, they were the ones

29:38.520 --> 29:42.080
 thinking like, oh God, this is following an exact exponential curve.

29:42.080 --> 29:47.240
 Um, and I heard that from a number of people, uh, so it's, and, and almost all of them are

29:47.240 --> 29:51.800
 like techies in some capacity, probably just cause I like live in the Bay area, but, but

29:51.800 --> 29:56.320
 for sure they, they're cognizant of this kind of, this kind of growth is present in a lot

29:56.320 --> 30:01.240
 of natural systems and a lot of, in a lot of, in a lot of systems.

30:01.240 --> 30:04.920
 Uh, I don't know if you've seen like, I mean, there's a lot of ways to visualize this obviously,

30:04.920 --> 30:12.000
 but Raker as well, I think was the one that had this like chess board where, um, every,

30:12.000 --> 30:15.720
 every square on the chess board, you double the number of stones or something in that

30:15.720 --> 30:16.720
 chess board.

30:16.720 --> 30:20.800
 I've heard, this is like an old proverb where it's like, you know, someone, the King offered

30:20.800 --> 30:24.560
 him a gift and he said, ah, the only gift I would like very modest, give me a single

30:24.560 --> 30:29.800
 grain of rice for the first chess board and then two grains of rice for the next square.

30:29.800 --> 30:32.600
 Then twice that for the next square and just continue on.

30:32.600 --> 30:37.120
 That's my only modest ask your sire and like, it's all, you know, more grains of rice than

30:37.120 --> 30:41.680
 there are, uh, anything in the world, um, by the time you get to the end.

30:41.680 --> 30:47.960
 And I, I, my intuition falls apart there, like, I would have never predicted that, like

30:47.960 --> 30:54.080
 for some reason, that's a really compelling, uh, illustration, how poorly breaks down.

30:54.080 --> 30:58.280
 Just like you said, maybe we're okay for the first few piles, but after, uh, of rocks,

30:58.280 --> 31:00.860
 but after a while it's game over.

31:00.860 --> 31:04.820
 You know, the other classic example for, um, gauging someone's intuitive understanding

31:04.820 --> 31:10.200
 of exponential growth is, uh, I've got like a Lily pad on a, on like really big lake,

31:10.200 --> 31:16.320
 um, like lake Michigan and that Lily pad replicates, it doubles, um, one day and then it doubles

31:16.320 --> 31:17.960
 the next day and it doubles the next day.

31:17.960 --> 31:22.320
 Um, and after 50 days, um, it actually is going to cover the entire lake.

31:22.320 --> 31:23.320
 Okay.

31:23.320 --> 31:25.840
 So after how many days does it cover half the lake?

31:25.840 --> 31:26.840
 49.

31:26.840 --> 31:30.600
 So you, you have a good instinct for exponential growth.

31:30.600 --> 31:31.600
 Right.

31:31.600 --> 31:35.560
 So I think a lot of, uh, like the knee jerk reaction is sometimes to think that it's like

31:35.560 --> 31:41.160
 half the amount of time or to at least be like surprised that like after 49 days, you've

31:41.160 --> 31:42.400
 only covered half of it.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.400
 Um, yeah.

31:43.400 --> 31:46.080
 I mean, that's the reason you heard a pause for me.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.440
 Um, I literally thought that can't be right.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.440
 Right.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.440
 Yeah, exactly.

31:50.440 --> 31:53.480
 So even when you know the fact and you do the division, it's like, wow.

31:53.480 --> 31:57.000
 So you've gotten like that whole time and then day 49, it's only covering half.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.940
 And then after that it gets the whole thing.

31:58.940 --> 32:02.080
 But I think you can make that even more visceral if rather than going one day before you say

32:02.080 --> 32:06.280
 how long until, um, it's covered 1% of the lake, right.

32:06.280 --> 32:08.080
 And it's, uh, so what would that be?

32:08.080 --> 32:12.240
 Um, how many times you have to double to get over a hundred, like seven, six and a half

32:12.240 --> 32:13.240
 times, something like that.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.240
 Right.

32:14.240 --> 32:17.920
 So at that point you're looking at 43, 44 days into it.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.880
 You're not even at 1% of the lake.

32:19.880 --> 32:23.360
 So you've, you've experienced, you know, 44 out of 50 days and you're like, ah, that's

32:23.360 --> 32:24.360
 really bad.

32:24.360 --> 32:25.580
 It's just 1% of the lake.

32:25.580 --> 32:28.760
 But then next thing you know, it's the entire lake.

32:28.760 --> 32:30.040
 You're wearing a space X shirt.

32:30.040 --> 32:38.000
 So let me ask you, let me ask you one, one person who talks about exponential, you know,

32:38.000 --> 32:42.700
 just the miracle of the exponential function in general is Elon Musk.

32:42.700 --> 32:51.720
 So he kind of advocates the idea of exponential thinking, you know, realizing that technological

32:51.720 --> 32:58.080
 development can, at least in the short term, follow exponential improvement, which breaks

32:58.080 --> 33:03.120
 apart our intuition, our ability to reason about what is and isn't impossible.

33:03.120 --> 33:04.760
 So he's a big one.

33:04.760 --> 33:09.080
 It's a good leadership kind of style of saying like, look, the thing that everyone thinks

33:09.080 --> 33:13.800
 is impossible is actually possible because exponentials.

33:13.800 --> 33:19.240
 But what's your sense about, um, about that kind of way to see the world?

33:19.240 --> 33:25.140
 Well, so I think it's, um, it can be very inspiring to note when something like Moore's

33:25.140 --> 33:29.160
 law is another great example where you have this exponential pattern that holds shockingly

33:29.160 --> 33:30.160
 well.

33:30.160 --> 33:33.480
 Um, and it enables, um, just better lives to be led.

33:33.480 --> 33:37.980
 I think the people who took Moore's law seriously in the sixties, we're seeing that, wow, it's

33:37.980 --> 33:41.580
 not going to be too long before like these giant computers that are either batch processing

33:41.580 --> 33:45.180
 or time shared, you could actually have one small enough to put on your desk on top of

33:45.180 --> 33:46.780
 your desk and you could do things.

33:46.780 --> 33:49.740
 And if they took it seriously, like you have people predicting smartphones like a long

33:49.740 --> 33:50.740
 time ago.

33:50.740 --> 33:55.120
 Um, and it's only out of like kind of this, I don't want to say faith in exponentials,

33:55.120 --> 33:58.120
 but an understanding that that's what's happening.

33:58.120 --> 34:03.400
 What's more interesting I think is to, um, really understand why exponential growth happens

34:03.400 --> 34:07.400
 and that the mechanism behind it is when the rate of change is proportional to the thing

34:07.400 --> 34:08.880
 in and of itself.

34:08.880 --> 34:14.240
 So the reason that technology would grow exponentially is only going to be if, um, the rate of progress

34:14.240 --> 34:16.360
 is proportional to the amount that you have.

34:16.360 --> 34:19.960
 So that the software you write enables you to write more software.

34:19.960 --> 34:25.080
 Um, and I think we see this with the internet, like the advent of the internet makes it faster

34:25.080 --> 34:29.200
 to learn things, which makes it faster to, uh, create new things.

34:29.200 --> 34:35.600
 Um, I think this is, uh, oftentimes why like investment will grow exponentially that the

34:35.600 --> 34:40.680
 more resources a company has, if it knows how to use them, well, the more, uh, the more

34:40.680 --> 34:41.680
 it can actually grow.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.520
 So, I mean, you know, you referenced Elon Musk.

34:43.520 --> 34:47.320
 I think he seems to really be into vertically integrating his companies.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.920
 I think a big part of that is because you have the sense, what you want is to make sure

34:49.920 --> 34:54.060
 that the things that you develop, you have ownership of in the, they enable further development

34:54.060 --> 34:55.800
 of the adjacent parts, right?

34:55.800 --> 35:00.320
 So it's not just this, you, you see a curve and you're blindly drawing a line through

35:00.320 --> 35:01.320
 it.

35:01.320 --> 35:04.960
 What's much more interesting is to ask, when do you have this proportional growth property?

35:04.960 --> 35:09.520
 Um, because then you can also recognize when it breaks down, like in an epidemic, as you

35:09.520 --> 35:11.640
 approach saturation, that would break down.

35:11.640 --> 35:16.520
 Um, as you do anything that, uh, skews what that proportionality constant is, um, you

35:16.520 --> 35:20.020
 can make it maybe not break down as being an exponential, but it can seriously slow

35:20.020 --> 35:21.480
 what that exponential rate is.

35:21.480 --> 35:28.960
 This is the opposite of a pandemic is you want, in terms of ideas, you want to minimize

35:28.960 --> 35:31.680
 barriers that, um, prevent the spread.

35:31.680 --> 35:33.620
 You want to maximize the spread of impact.

35:33.620 --> 35:38.720
 So like you want it to, to grow when you're doing technological development is so that

35:38.720 --> 35:42.240
 you do hold up that rate holds up.

35:42.240 --> 35:47.400
 And that's, that's almost like, uh, like an operational challenge of like how you run

35:47.400 --> 35:52.640
 a company, how you run a group of people is that any one invention has a ripple that's

35:52.640 --> 35:54.440
 unstopped.

35:54.440 --> 35:58.000
 And that ripple effect then has its own ripple effects and so on.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
 And that continues.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
 Yeah.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
 Like Moore's law is fascinating.

36:01.000 --> 36:06.760
 And the, like on a psychological level and a human level, cause it's not exponential.

36:06.760 --> 36:13.400
 It's, it's just a consistent set of like what you would call like S curves, which is like,

36:13.400 --> 36:18.120
 it's constantly like breakthrough innovations nonstop.

36:18.120 --> 36:19.120
 That's a good point.

36:19.120 --> 36:22.680
 Like it might not actually be an example of exponentials because of something which grows

36:22.680 --> 36:23.920
 in proportion to itself.

36:23.920 --> 36:27.880
 But instead it's almost like a benchmark that was set out that everyone's been pressured

36:27.880 --> 36:29.000
 to meet.

36:29.000 --> 36:33.840
 And it's like all these innovations and micro inventions along the way, rather than some

36:33.840 --> 36:38.480
 consistent sit back and just let the lily pad grow across the lake phenomenon.

36:38.480 --> 36:42.600
 And it's also that there's a human psychological level for sure of like the four minute mile,

36:42.600 --> 36:45.080
 like it's something about it.

36:45.080 --> 36:51.800
 Like saying that, look, there is, you know, Moore's law, it's a law.

36:51.800 --> 36:56.720
 So like it's a, it's certainly an achievable thing.

36:56.720 --> 36:59.920
 You know, we achieved it for the last decade, for the last two decades, for the last three

36:59.920 --> 37:04.320
 decades, you just keep going and it somehow makes it happen.

37:04.320 --> 37:10.520
 I mean, it makes people, I'm continuously surprised in this world how few people do

37:10.520 --> 37:18.200
 the best work in the world, like in that particular, whatever that field is, like it's very often

37:18.200 --> 37:25.480
 that like the genius, I mean, you couldn't argue that community matters, but it's certain

37:25.480 --> 37:32.080
 like I've been in groups of engineers where like one person is clearly like doing an incredible

37:32.080 --> 37:38.880
 amount of work and just is the genius and it's fascinating to see basically it's kind

37:38.880 --> 37:46.840
 of the Steve Jobs idea is maybe the whole point is to create an atmosphere where the

37:46.840 --> 37:52.080
 genius can discover themselves, like have the opportunity to do the best work of their

37:52.080 --> 37:57.920
 life and yeah, and that the exponential is just milking that.

37:57.920 --> 38:03.120
 It's like rippling the idea that it's possible and that idea that it's possible finds the

38:03.120 --> 38:07.200
 right people for the four minute mile and the idea that it's possible finds the right

38:07.200 --> 38:12.520
 runners to run it and then expose the number of people who can run faster than four minutes.

38:12.520 --> 38:17.140
 It's kind of interesting to, I don't know, basically the positive way to see that is

38:17.140 --> 38:22.320
 most of us are way more intelligent, have way more potential than we ever realized.

38:22.320 --> 38:26.520
 I guess that's kind of depressing, but I mean like the ceiling for most of us is much higher

38:26.520 --> 38:28.640
 than we ever realized.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.640
 That is true.

38:29.640 --> 38:34.740
 A good book to read if you want that sense is Peak, which essentially talks about peak

38:34.740 --> 38:39.200
 performance in a lot of different ways, like chess, London cab drivers, how many pushups

38:39.200 --> 38:45.600
 people can do, short term memory tasks, and it's meant to be like a concrete manifesto

38:45.600 --> 38:50.480
 about deliberate practice and such, but the one sensation you come out with is wow, no

38:50.480 --> 38:54.560
 matter how good people are at something, they can get better and like way better than we

38:54.560 --> 38:55.680
 think they could.

38:55.680 --> 38:59.480
 I don't know if that's actually related to exponential growth, but I do think it's a

38:59.480 --> 39:01.440
 true phenomenon that's interesting.

39:01.440 --> 39:06.720
 Yeah, I mean, there's certainly no law of exponential growth in human innovation.

39:06.720 --> 39:09.920
 Well, I don't know.

39:09.920 --> 39:11.480
 Well kind of, there is.

39:11.480 --> 39:15.200
 I think it's very interesting to see when innovations in one field allow for innovations

39:15.200 --> 39:16.200
 in another.

39:16.200 --> 39:20.440
 Like the advent of computing seems like a prerequisite for the advent of chaos theory.

39:20.440 --> 39:25.120
 You have this truth about physics and the world that in theory could be known.

39:25.120 --> 39:29.960
 You could find Lorenz's equations without computers, but in practice, it was just never

39:29.960 --> 39:34.200
 going to be analyzed that way unless you were doing like a bunch of simulations and that

39:34.200 --> 39:36.520
 you could computationally see these models.

39:36.520 --> 39:40.360
 So it's like physics allowed for computers, computers allowed for better physics, and

39:40.360 --> 39:42.500
 you know, wash, rinse and repeat.

39:42.500 --> 39:45.720
 That self proportionality, that's exponential.

39:45.720 --> 39:50.920
 So I think I wouldn't think it's too far to say that that's a law of some kind.

39:50.920 --> 39:59.760
 Yeah, a fundamental law of the universe is that these descendants of apes will exponentially

39:59.760 --> 40:05.280
 improve their technology and one day be taken over by the AGI.

40:05.280 --> 40:06.280
 That's built in.

40:06.280 --> 40:09.640
 That'll make the video game fun, whoever created this thing.

40:09.640 --> 40:12.960
 So I mean, since you're wearing a space X shirt, let me ask.

40:12.960 --> 40:15.960
 I didn't realize I was wearing a space X shirt.

40:15.960 --> 40:16.960
 I apologize.

40:16.960 --> 40:17.960
 It's on point.

40:17.960 --> 40:18.960
 So it's on topic.

40:18.960 --> 40:19.960
 I'll take it.

40:19.960 --> 40:32.600
 It's the first crewed mission out into space since the space shuttle and just by first

40:32.600 --> 40:37.880
 time ever by a commercial company, I mean, it's an incredible accomplishment, I think,

40:37.880 --> 40:44.560
 but it's also just an incredible, it inspires imagination amongst people that this is the

40:44.560 --> 40:50.960
 first step in a long, vibrant journey of humans into space.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.800
 So how do you feel?

40:52.800 --> 40:55.000
 Is this exciting to you?

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
 Yeah, it is.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
 I think it's great.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.360
 The idea of seeing it basically done by smaller entities instead of by governments.

41:00.360 --> 41:04.720
 I mean, it's a heavy collaboration between space X and NASA in this case, but moving

41:04.720 --> 41:09.340
 in the direction of not necessarily requiring an entire country and its government to make

41:09.340 --> 41:14.840
 it happen, but that you can have something closer to a single company doing it.

41:14.840 --> 41:18.320
 We're not there yet because it's not like they're unilaterally saying like we're just

41:18.320 --> 41:20.960
 shooting people up into space.

41:20.960 --> 41:25.680
 It's just a sign that we're able to do more powerful things with smaller groups of people.

41:25.680 --> 41:26.680
 I find that inspiring.

41:26.680 --> 41:27.680
 Innovate quickly.

41:27.680 --> 41:30.800
 I hope we see people land on Mars in my lifetime.

41:30.800 --> 41:32.360
 Do you think we will?

41:32.360 --> 41:33.360
 I think so.

41:33.360 --> 41:35.600
 I mean, I think there's a ton of challenges there, right?

41:35.600 --> 41:37.720
 Like radiation being kind of the biggest one.

41:37.720 --> 41:42.160
 And I think there's a ton of people who look at that and say, why?

41:42.160 --> 41:43.880
 Why would you want to do that?

41:43.880 --> 41:46.100
 Let's let the robots do the science for us.

41:46.100 --> 41:50.520
 But I think there's enough people who are genuinely inspired about broadening the worlds

41:50.520 --> 41:55.800
 that we've touched or people who think about things like backing up the light of consciousness

41:55.800 --> 41:59.800
 with super long term visions of terraforming, like as long as there's a backing up the

41:59.800 --> 42:00.800
 light of consciousness.

42:00.800 --> 42:01.800
 Yeah.

42:01.800 --> 42:07.800
 I thought that if Earth goes to hell, we've got to have a backup somewhere.

42:07.800 --> 42:10.800
 A lot of people see that as pretty out there and it's like not in the short term future,

42:10.800 --> 42:12.680
 but I think that's an inspiring thought.

42:12.680 --> 42:17.160
 I think that's a reason to get up in the morning and I feel like most employees at SpaceX feel

42:17.160 --> 42:18.160
 that way too.

42:18.160 --> 42:21.360
 Do you think we'll colonize Mars one day?

42:21.360 --> 42:22.360
 No idea.

42:22.360 --> 42:26.080
 Like either AGI kills us first or if we're like allowed, I don't know if it'll take us

42:26.080 --> 42:27.080
 for allowed.

42:27.080 --> 42:29.960
 Well, like honestly, it would take such a long time.

42:29.960 --> 42:32.760
 Like, okay, you might have a small colony, right?

42:32.760 --> 42:39.840
 Something like what you see in the Martian, but not like people living comfortably there.

42:39.840 --> 42:46.200
 But if you want to talk about actual like second Earth kind of stuff, that's just like

42:46.200 --> 42:50.680
 way far out there and the future moves so fast that it's hard to predict.

42:50.680 --> 42:53.520
 We might just kill ourselves before that even becomes viable.

42:53.520 --> 42:54.520
 Yeah.

42:54.520 --> 42:58.040
 I mean, there's a lot of possibilities where it could be just, it doesn't have to be on

42:58.040 --> 43:07.360
 a planet, we could be floating out in space, have a space faring backup solution that doesn't

43:07.360 --> 43:11.440
 have to deal with the constraints that a planet, I mean, a planet provides a lot of possibilities

43:11.440 --> 43:13.800
 and resources, but also has some constraints.

43:13.800 --> 43:14.800
 Yeah.

43:14.800 --> 43:19.560
 I mean, for me, for some reason, it's a deeply exciting possibility.

43:19.560 --> 43:20.560
 Oh yeah.

43:20.560 --> 43:21.560
 Yeah.

43:21.560 --> 43:24.720
 All of the people who were like skeptical about it are like, why do we care about going

43:24.720 --> 43:25.720
 to Mars?

43:25.720 --> 43:28.640
 Like, what makes you care about anything that's inspiring?

43:28.640 --> 43:29.640
 It's hard.

43:29.640 --> 43:34.760
 It actually is hard to hear that because exactly as you put it on a philosophical level, it's

43:34.760 --> 43:37.600
 hard to say, why do anything?

43:37.600 --> 43:38.740
 I don't know.

43:38.740 --> 43:45.560
 It's like the people say like, I've been doing like an insane challenge last 30 something

43:45.560 --> 43:46.560
 days.

43:46.560 --> 43:47.560
 Your pull ups?

43:47.560 --> 43:55.080
 The pull ups and push ups and like, a bunch of people are like, awesome.

43:55.080 --> 43:57.040
 They're insane, but awesome.

43:57.040 --> 43:59.520
 And then some people are like, why?

43:59.520 --> 44:00.720
 Why do anything?

44:00.720 --> 44:02.720
 I don't know.

44:02.720 --> 44:03.720
 There's a calling.

44:03.720 --> 44:09.720
 It's, I'm with JFK a little bit is because we do these things because they're hard.

44:09.720 --> 44:14.120
 There's something in the human spirit that says like, same with like a math problem.

44:14.120 --> 44:20.240
 There's something you fail once and it's like this feeling that, you know what, I'm not

44:20.240 --> 44:21.800
 going to back down from this.

44:21.800 --> 44:25.320
 There's something to be discovered in overcoming this thing.

44:25.320 --> 44:29.560
 So what I like about it is, and I also like this about the moon missions, sure, it's kind

44:29.560 --> 44:32.020
 of arbitrary, but you can't move the target.

44:32.020 --> 44:36.120
 So you can't make it easier and say that you've accomplished the goal.

44:36.120 --> 44:39.640
 And when that happens, it just demands actual innovation, right?

44:39.640 --> 44:44.720
 Like protecting humans from the radiation in space on the flight there while they're

44:44.720 --> 44:46.820
 hard problem demands innovation.

44:46.820 --> 44:49.500
 You can't move the goalpost to make that easier.

44:49.500 --> 44:52.560
 But certainly the innovations required for things like that will be relevant in a bunch

44:52.560 --> 44:54.820
 of other domains too.

44:54.820 --> 44:59.280
 So like the idea of doing something merely because it's hard, it's like loosely productive.

44:59.280 --> 45:00.280
 Great.

45:00.280 --> 45:03.240
 But as long as you can't move the goalposts, there's probably going to be these secondary

45:03.240 --> 45:07.000
 benefits that like we should all strive for.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
 Yeah.

45:08.000 --> 45:13.280
 I mean, it's hard to formulate the Mars colonization problem as something that has a deadline,

45:13.280 --> 45:15.360
 which is the problem.

45:15.360 --> 45:23.360
 But if there was a deadline, then the amount of things we would come up with by forcing

45:23.360 --> 45:29.100
 ourselves to figure out how to colonize that place would be just incredible.

45:29.100 --> 45:34.280
 This is what people, like the internet didn't get created because people sat down and try

45:34.280 --> 45:41.480
 to figure out how do I, you know, send TikTok videos of myself dancing to people.

45:41.480 --> 45:44.880
 They, you know, it was, there's an application.

45:44.880 --> 45:48.120
 I mean, actually I don't even know what do you think the application for the internet

45:48.120 --> 45:53.360
 was when it was, it must've been very low level basic network communication within DARPA,

45:53.360 --> 46:00.600
 like military based, like how do I send like a networking, how do I send information securely

46:00.600 --> 46:03.040
 between two places?

46:03.040 --> 46:04.040
 Maybe it was an encryption.

46:04.040 --> 46:08.160
 I'm totally speaking totally outside of my knowledge, but like it was probably intended

46:08.160 --> 46:10.200
 for a very narrow, small group of people.

46:10.200 --> 46:13.880
 Well, so I mean, it was, there was like this small community of people who are really interested

46:13.880 --> 46:20.000
 in timesharing computing and like interactive computing in contrast with a batch processing.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.600
 And then the idea that as you set up like a timesharing center, basically meaning kind

46:24.600 --> 46:28.820
 of multiple people like logged in and using that like central computer, why not make it

46:28.820 --> 46:30.360
 accessible to others?

46:30.360 --> 46:33.880
 And this was kind of what I had always thought like, Oh, is this like fringe group that was

46:33.880 --> 46:37.820
 interested in this new kind of computing and they all like got themselves together.

46:37.820 --> 46:41.360
 But the thing is like DARPA wouldn't act, you wouldn't have the U S government funding

46:41.360 --> 46:44.020
 that just for the funds of it, right?

46:44.020 --> 46:48.880
 In some sense, that's what ARPA was all about was like just really advanced research for

46:48.880 --> 46:53.400
 the sake of having advanced research and it doesn't have to pay out with utility soon.

46:53.400 --> 46:57.480
 But the core parts of its development were happening like in the middle of the Vietnam

46:57.480 --> 47:01.360
 war when there was budgetary constraints all over the place.

47:01.360 --> 47:06.400
 I only learned this recently, actually, like if you look at the documents, basically justifying

47:06.400 --> 47:12.840
 the budget for the ARPANET as they were developing it, and not just keeping it where it was,

47:12.840 --> 47:15.880
 but actively growing it while all sorts of other departments were having their funding

47:15.880 --> 47:21.440
 cut because of the war, a big part of it was national defense in terms of having like a

47:21.440 --> 47:26.500
 more robust communication system, like the idea of packet switching versus circuit switching.

47:26.500 --> 47:31.000
 You could kind of make this case that in some calamitous circumstance where a central location

47:31.000 --> 47:36.360
 gets nuked, this is a much more resilient way to still have your communication lines

47:36.360 --> 47:45.560
 that like traditional telephone lines weren't as resilient to, which I just found very interesting.

47:45.560 --> 47:48.760
 Even something that we see as so happy go lucky is just a bunch of computer nerds trying

47:48.760 --> 47:51.060
 to get like interactive computing out there.

47:51.060 --> 47:57.480
 The actual thing that made it funded and thing that made it advance when it did was because

47:57.480 --> 48:00.880
 of this direct national security question and concern.

48:00.880 --> 48:02.360
 I don't know if you've read it.

48:02.360 --> 48:03.360
 I haven't read it.

48:03.360 --> 48:06.320
 I don't know if I've been meaning to read it, but Neil deGrasse Tyson actually came out

48:06.320 --> 48:11.640
 with a book that talks about like science in the context of the military, like basically

48:11.640 --> 48:18.640
 saying all the great science we've done in the 20th century was like because of the military.

48:18.640 --> 48:23.880
 He paints a positive, it's not like a critical, a lot of people say like military industrial

48:23.880 --> 48:25.880
 complex and so on.

48:25.880 --> 48:30.400
 Another way to see the military and national security is like a source of, like you said,

48:30.400 --> 48:37.200
 headlines and like hard things you can't move, like almost like scaring yourself into being

48:37.200 --> 48:38.200
 productive.

48:38.200 --> 48:39.200
 It is that.

48:39.200 --> 48:43.240
 I mean, Manhattan Project is a perfect example, probably the quintessential example.

48:43.240 --> 48:48.440
 That one is a little bit more macabre than others because of like what they were building,

48:48.440 --> 48:54.800
 but in terms of how many focused, smart hours of human intelligence get pointed towards

48:54.800 --> 48:58.580
 a topic per day, you're just maxing it out with that sense of worry.

48:58.580 --> 49:01.600
 In that context, everyone there was saying like, we've got to get the bomb before Hitler

49:01.600 --> 49:08.340
 does and that just lights a fire under you that I, again, like the circumstances macabre,

49:08.340 --> 49:11.540
 but I think that's actually pretty healthy, especially for researchers that are otherwise

49:11.540 --> 49:17.040
 going to be really theoretical to take these like theorizers and say, make this real physical

49:17.040 --> 49:18.640
 thing happen.

49:18.640 --> 49:22.380
 Meaning a lot of it is going to be unsexy, a lot of it's going to be like young Feynman

49:22.380 --> 49:28.120
 sitting there kind of inventing a notion of computation in order to like compute what

49:28.120 --> 49:31.940
 they needed to compute more quickly with like the rudimentary automated tools that they

49:31.940 --> 49:34.280
 had available.

49:34.280 --> 49:39.460
 I think you see this with Bell Labs also where you've got otherwise very theorizing minds

49:39.460 --> 49:43.600
 in very pragmatic contexts that I think is like really helpful for the theory as well

49:43.600 --> 49:46.280
 as for the applications.

49:46.280 --> 49:50.280
 I think that stuff can be positive for progress.

49:50.280 --> 49:52.760
 You mentioned Bell Labs and Manhattan Project.

49:52.760 --> 49:58.240
 This kind of makes me curious for the things you've create, which are quite singular.

49:58.240 --> 50:04.040
 Like if you look at all YouTube or just not YouTube, it doesn't matter what it is.

50:04.040 --> 50:06.920
 It's just teaching content, art, it doesn't matter.

50:06.920 --> 50:11.620
 It's like, yep, that's, that's grant, right?

50:11.620 --> 50:12.620
 That's unique.

50:12.620 --> 50:15.700
 I know you're teaching style and everything.

50:15.700 --> 50:22.000
 Does it, Manhattan Project and Bell Labs was like famously a lot of brilliant people, but

50:22.000 --> 50:23.480
 there's a lot of them.

50:23.480 --> 50:25.200
 They play off of each other.

50:25.200 --> 50:28.880
 So like my question for you is that, does it get lonely?

50:28.880 --> 50:32.640
 Honestly, that right there, I think is the biggest part of my life that I would like

50:32.640 --> 50:39.640
 to change in some way that I look at a Bell Labs type situation and I'm like, God damn,

50:39.640 --> 50:44.160
 I love that whole situation and I'm so jealous of it and you're like reading about Hamming

50:44.160 --> 50:47.480
 and then you see that he also shared an office with Shannon and you're like, of course he

50:47.480 --> 50:48.480
 did.

50:48.480 --> 50:49.480
 Of course they shared an office.

50:49.480 --> 50:50.480
 That's how these ideas get.

50:50.480 --> 50:53.320
 And they actually probably very likely worked separately.

50:53.320 --> 50:55.360
 Yeah, totally, totally separate.

50:55.360 --> 50:59.720
 But there's a literally, and sorry to interrupt, there's a literally magic that happens when

50:59.720 --> 51:06.480
 you run into each other, like on the way to like getting a snack or something.

51:06.480 --> 51:09.320
 Conversations you overhear, it's other projects you're pulled into, it's like puzzles that

51:09.320 --> 51:12.240
 colleagues are sharing, like all of that.

51:12.240 --> 51:17.960
 I have some extent of it just because I try to stay well connected in communities of people

51:17.960 --> 51:19.720
 who think in similar ways.

51:19.720 --> 51:25.120
 But it's not in the day to day in the same way, which I would like to fix somehow.

51:25.120 --> 51:35.040
 That's one of the, I would say one of the biggest, well, one of the many drawbacks,

51:35.040 --> 51:40.920
 negative things about this current pandemic is that whatever the term is, but like chance

51:40.920 --> 51:44.160
 collisions are significantly reduced.

51:44.160 --> 51:50.440
 I saw, I don't know why I saw this, but on my brother's work calendar, he had a scheduled

51:50.440 --> 51:57.240
 slot with someone that he scheduled a meeting and the title of the whole meeting was no

51:57.240 --> 51:58.240
 specific agenda.

51:58.240 --> 52:02.200
 I just missed the happenstance serendipitous conversations that we used to have, which

52:02.200 --> 52:05.080
 the pandemic and remote work has so cruelly taken away from us.

52:05.080 --> 52:06.080
 Brilliant.

52:06.080 --> 52:07.080
 That's brilliant.

52:07.080 --> 52:09.720
 I'm like, that's the way to do it.

52:09.720 --> 52:13.680
 You just schedule those things, schedule the serendipitous interaction.

52:13.680 --> 52:16.400
 That's like, I mean, you can't do it in an academic setting, but it's basically like

52:16.400 --> 52:22.080
 going to a bar and sitting there just for the strangers you might meet, just the strangers

52:22.080 --> 52:26.280
 or striking up a conversation with strangers on the train.

52:26.280 --> 52:33.820
 Harder to do when you're deeply like maybe myself or maybe a lot of academic types who

52:33.820 --> 52:38.440
 are like introverted and avoid human contact as much as possible.

52:38.440 --> 52:43.600
 So it's nice when it's forced, those chance collisions, but maybe scheduling is a possibility

52:43.600 --> 52:48.000
 but for the most part, do you work alone?

52:48.000 --> 52:53.660
 I'm sure you struggle a lot.

52:53.660 --> 53:00.200
 You probably hit moments when you look at this and you say like, this is the wrong way

53:00.200 --> 53:01.200
 to show it.

53:01.200 --> 53:02.440
 It's a long way to visualize it.

53:02.440 --> 53:04.160
 I'm making it too hard for myself.

53:04.160 --> 53:05.740
 I'm going down the wrong direction.

53:05.740 --> 53:06.740
 This is too long.

53:06.740 --> 53:07.740
 This is too short.

53:07.740 --> 53:11.360
 All those self doubt that could be paralyzing.

53:11.360 --> 53:13.160
 What do you do in those moments?

53:13.160 --> 53:18.720
 I actually much prefer like work to be a solitary affair for me.

53:18.720 --> 53:19.880
 That's like a personality quirk.

53:19.880 --> 53:23.280
 I would like it to be in an environment with others and like collaborative in the sense

53:23.280 --> 53:24.700
 of ideas exchanged.

53:24.700 --> 53:27.980
 But those phenomena you're describing when you say this is too long, this is too short,

53:27.980 --> 53:31.920
 this visualization sucks, it's way easier to say that to yourself than it is to say

53:31.920 --> 53:34.300
 to a collaborator.

53:34.300 --> 53:36.440
 And I know that's just a thing that I'm not good at.

53:36.440 --> 53:41.200
 So in that way, it's very easy to just throw away a script because the script isn't working.

53:41.200 --> 53:43.400
 It's hard to tell someone else they should do the same.

53:43.400 --> 53:47.560
 Actually last time we talked, I think it was like very close to me talking Don Knuth was

53:47.560 --> 53:48.560
 kind of cool.

53:48.560 --> 53:49.560
 Like two people that...

53:49.560 --> 53:51.560
 I can't believe you got that interview.

53:51.560 --> 53:52.560
 It's the hard...

53:52.560 --> 53:54.960
 No, can I brag about something?

53:54.960 --> 53:55.960
 Please.

53:55.960 --> 54:01.520
 My favorite thing is Don Knuth, after did the interview, he offered to go out to hot

54:01.520 --> 54:02.520
 dogs with me.

54:02.520 --> 54:03.520
 To get hot dogs.

54:03.520 --> 54:04.520
 That was never...

54:04.520 --> 54:09.480
 Like people ask me what's the favorite interview you've ever done and that has to be...

54:09.480 --> 54:12.760
 But unfortunately I couldn't, I had a thing after.

54:12.760 --> 54:14.440
 So I had to turn down Don Knuth.

54:14.440 --> 54:15.440
 You missed Knuth dogs?

54:15.440 --> 54:16.440
 Knuth dogs.

54:16.440 --> 54:17.440
 Sorry.

54:17.440 --> 54:22.200
 So that was a little bragging, but the hot dogs, he's such a sweet.

54:22.200 --> 54:28.000
 But the reason I bring that up is he works through problems alone as well.

54:28.000 --> 54:33.360
 He prefers that struggle, the struggle of it.

54:33.360 --> 54:40.720
 Writers like Stephen King often talk about their process of what they do, what they eat

54:40.720 --> 54:49.280
 when they wake up, when they sit down, how they like their desk on a perfectly productive

54:49.280 --> 54:51.680
 day.

54:51.680 --> 54:56.600
 What they like to do, how long they like to work for, what enables them to think deeply,

54:56.600 --> 54:57.600
 all that kind of stuff.

54:57.600 --> 55:00.520
 Hunter S. Thompson did a lot of drugs.

55:00.520 --> 55:03.000
 Everybody has their own thing.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.880
 Do you have a thing?

55:05.880 --> 55:10.720
 If you were to lay out a perfect productive day, what would that schedule look like do

55:10.720 --> 55:11.720
 you think?

55:11.720 --> 55:19.360
 Part of that's hard to answer because like the mode of work I do changes a lot from day

55:19.360 --> 55:20.360
 to day.

55:20.360 --> 55:21.400
 Like some days I'm writing.

55:21.400 --> 55:22.900
 The thing I have to do is write a script.

55:22.900 --> 55:23.900
 Some days I'm animating.

55:23.900 --> 55:24.900
 The thing I have to do is animate.

55:24.900 --> 55:27.160
 Sometimes I'm like working on the animation library.

55:27.160 --> 55:30.720
 The thing I have to do is like a little, I'm not a software engineer, but something in

55:30.720 --> 55:32.560
 the direction of software engineering.

55:32.560 --> 55:34.520
 Some days it's like a variant of research.

55:34.520 --> 55:37.620
 It's like learn this topic well and try to learn it differently.

55:37.620 --> 55:41.520
 So those are like four very different modes.

55:41.520 --> 55:45.360
 Some days it's like get through the email backlog of people I've been, tasks I've been

55:45.360 --> 55:46.360
 putting off.

55:46.360 --> 55:51.960
 It goes research, scripting, like the idea starts with research and then there's scripting

55:51.960 --> 55:56.800
 and then there's programming and then there's the showtime.

55:56.800 --> 56:01.440
 And the research side, by the way, I think a problematic way to do it is to say I'm starting

56:01.440 --> 56:03.960
 this project and therefore I'm starting the research.

56:03.960 --> 56:08.020
 Instead it should be that you're like ambiently learning a ton of things just in the background

56:08.020 --> 56:11.660
 and then once you feel like you have the understanding for one, you put it on the list of things

56:11.660 --> 56:14.040
 that there can be a video for.

56:14.040 --> 56:18.660
 Otherwise either you're going to end up roadblocked forever or you're just not going to like have

56:18.660 --> 56:21.920
 a good way of talking about it.

56:21.920 --> 56:25.120
 But still some of the days it's like the thing to do is learn new things.

56:25.120 --> 56:26.360
 So what's the most painful one?

56:26.360 --> 56:29.120
 I think you mentioned scripting.

56:29.120 --> 56:30.520
 Scripting is yeah, that's the worst.

56:30.520 --> 56:31.880
 Yeah, writing is the worst.

56:31.880 --> 56:35.520
 So what's your, on a perfectly, so let's take the hardest one.

56:35.520 --> 56:37.320
 What's a perfectly productive day?

56:37.320 --> 56:41.800
 You wake up and it's like, damn it, this is the day I need to do some scripting.

56:41.800 --> 56:45.600
 And like you didn't do anything the last two days so you came up with excuses to procrastinate

56:45.600 --> 56:47.480
 so today must be the day.

56:47.480 --> 56:57.100
 Yeah, I wake up early, I guess I exercise and then I turn the internet off.

56:57.100 --> 57:01.520
 If we're writing, yeah, that's what's required is having the internet off and then maybe

57:01.520 --> 57:04.200
 you keep notes on the things that you want to Google when you're allowed to have the

57:04.200 --> 57:05.200
 internet again.

57:05.200 --> 57:08.820
 I'm not great about doing that, but when I do, that makes it happen.

57:08.820 --> 57:13.200
 And then when I hit writer's block, like the solution to writer's block is to read.

57:13.200 --> 57:14.360
 Doesn't even have to be related.

57:14.360 --> 57:18.340
 Just read something different just for like 15 minutes, half an hour and then go back

57:18.340 --> 57:20.160
 to writing.

57:20.160 --> 57:22.520
 That when it's a nice cycle, I think can work very well.

57:22.520 --> 57:26.200
 And when you're writing the script, you don't know where it ends, right?

57:26.200 --> 57:28.820
 Like you have a problem solving videos.

57:28.820 --> 57:30.840
 I know where it ends, expositional videos.

57:30.840 --> 57:36.760
 I don't know where it ends coming up with a, with the magical thing that makes this

57:36.760 --> 57:41.980
 whole story, like ties this whole story together that when does that happen?

57:41.980 --> 57:45.120
 That's that's the thing that makes it such that a topic gets put on the list of like

57:45.120 --> 57:46.120
 videos.

57:46.120 --> 57:47.120
 Oh, that's an issue.

57:47.120 --> 57:50.760
 You shouldn't start the project unless there's one of those and you have, you have so many

57:50.760 --> 57:55.040
 nice bags that you haven't such a big bag of aha moments already that you could just

57:55.040 --> 57:56.880
 pull at it.

57:56.880 --> 57:57.960
 That's one of the things.

57:57.960 --> 58:05.400
 And one of the sad things about time and that nothing lasts forever and that we're all mortal.

58:05.400 --> 58:14.660
 Let's not get into that discussion is, you know, if I see like, even when I ask for people

58:14.660 --> 58:19.600
 to ask, like ask, I did a call for questions and people want to ask you questions and so

58:19.600 --> 58:23.520
 many requests from people about like certain videos they would love you to do.

58:23.520 --> 58:30.480
 It's such a pile and I think that's a, that's a sign of like admiration from people for

58:30.480 --> 58:31.480
 sure.

58:31.480 --> 58:35.200
 But it's like, it makes me sad cause like whenever I see them, people give ideas, they're

58:35.200 --> 58:38.640
 all like very often really good ideas.

58:38.640 --> 58:44.960
 And it's like, it's such a, it makes me sad in the same kind of way when I go through

58:44.960 --> 58:49.160
 a library or through a bookstore, you see all these amazing books that you'll never

58:49.160 --> 58:52.720
 get to open.

58:52.720 --> 58:53.720
 So yeah.

58:53.720 --> 58:59.200
 So you gotta enjoy the ones that you have, enjoy the books that are open and don't let

58:59.200 --> 59:02.960
 yourself lament the ones that stay closed.

59:02.960 --> 59:03.960
 What else?

59:03.960 --> 59:05.120
 Is there any other magic to that day?

59:05.120 --> 59:08.720
 So do you try to dedicate like a certain number of hours?

59:08.720 --> 59:13.160
 Do you, Cal Newport has this deep work kind of idea.

59:13.160 --> 59:17.640
 There's systematic people who like get really on top of, you know, they checklist of what

59:17.640 --> 59:20.280
 they're going to do in the day and they like count their hours.

59:20.280 --> 59:23.280
 And I am not a systematic person in that way.

59:23.280 --> 59:24.560
 Which is probably a problem.

59:24.560 --> 59:30.800
 I very likely would get more done if I was systematic in that way, but that doesn't happen.

59:30.800 --> 59:35.920
 So you talk to me later in life and maybe I'll have like changed my ways and give you

59:35.920 --> 59:37.360
 a very different answer.

59:37.360 --> 59:42.760
 I think Benjamin Franklin like later in life figured out the rigor is these like very rigorous

59:42.760 --> 59:45.000
 schedules and how to be productive.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.640
 I think those schedules are much more fun to write.

59:47.640 --> 59:50.840
 Like it's very fun to like write a schedule and make a blog post about like the perfect

59:50.840 --> 59:54.360
 productive day that like might work for one person.

59:54.360 --> 59:57.820
 But I don't know how much people get out of like reading them or trying to adopt someone

59:57.820 --> 59:59.160
 else's style.

59:59.160 --> 1:00:01.360
 And I'm not even sure that they've ever followed.

1:00:01.360 --> 1:00:02.360
 Exactly.

1:00:02.360 --> 1:00:05.640
 You're always going to write it as the best version of yourself.

1:00:05.640 --> 1:00:10.240
 You're not going to explain the phenomenon of like wanting to get out of the bed, but

1:00:10.240 --> 1:00:13.520
 not really wanting to get out of the bed and all of that.

1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:18.720
 And just like zoning out for random reasons or the one that people probably don't touch

1:00:18.720 --> 1:00:24.160
 at all is I try to check social media once a day, but I'm like only.

1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:26.440
 So I post and that's it.

1:00:26.440 --> 1:00:28.840
 When I post, I check the previous days.

1:00:28.840 --> 1:00:31.880
 That's like my, what I try to do.

1:00:31.880 --> 1:00:34.080
 That's what I do like 90% of the days.

1:00:34.080 --> 1:00:38.680
 But then I'll go, I'll have like a two week period where it's just like, I'm checking

1:00:38.680 --> 1:00:44.320
 the internet like, I mean, it's some, probably some scary number of times and a lot of people

1:00:44.320 --> 1:00:45.320
 can resonate with that.

1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:47.480
 I think it's a legitimate addiction.

1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:52.740
 It's like, it's a dopamine addiction and it's, I don't know if it's a problem because as

1:00:52.740 --> 1:00:55.920
 long as it's the kind of socializing, like if you're actually engaging with friends and

1:00:55.920 --> 1:01:00.080
 engaging with other people's ideas, uh, I think it can be really useful.

1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:01.480
 Well, I don't know.

1:01:01.480 --> 1:01:07.080
 So like for sure I agree with you, but I'm, it's a, it's definitely an addiction because

1:01:07.080 --> 1:01:09.640
 for me, I think it's true for a lot of people.

1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:14.560
 I am very cognizant of the fact I just don't feel that happy.

1:01:14.560 --> 1:01:20.280
 If I look at a day where I've checked social media a lot, like if I just aggregate, I did

1:01:20.280 --> 1:01:26.160
 a self report, I'm sure I would find that I'm just like literally on like less happy

1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:29.880
 with my life and myself after I've done that check.

1:01:29.880 --> 1:01:36.000
 When I check it once a day, I'm very like, I'm happy I even like, cause I've seen it.

1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:37.000
 Okay.

1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:42.360
 One way to measure that is when somebody says something not nice to you on the internet

1:01:42.360 --> 1:01:48.600
 is like when I check it once a day, I'm able to just like, like I smile, like, like I virtually,

1:01:48.600 --> 1:01:51.520
 I think about them positively, empathetically, I send them love.

1:01:51.520 --> 1:01:56.080
 I don't, I don't ever respond, but I just feel positively about the whole thing.

1:01:56.080 --> 1:02:01.520
 If I check it, if I check like more than that, it starts eating at me.

1:02:01.520 --> 1:02:07.600
 Like it start, there, there's an eating thing that, that happens like anxiety.

1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:11.160
 It occupies a part of your mind that's not, doesn't seem to be healthy.

1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:15.760
 Same with, I mean, you, you, you put stuff out on YouTube.

1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:17.520
 I think it's important.

1:02:17.520 --> 1:02:21.260
 I think you have a million dimensions that are interesting to you, but yeah, one of,

1:02:21.260 --> 1:02:26.800
 one of the interesting ones is the study of education and the psychological aspect of

1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:28.880
 putting stuff up on YouTube.

1:02:28.880 --> 1:02:34.560
 I like now have completely stopped checking statistics of any kind.

1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:39.920
 I've released an episode a 100 with my dad, conversation with my dad.

1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:44.920
 He checks, he's probably listening to this stop.

1:02:44.920 --> 1:02:49.560
 He checks the number of views on his, on his video, on his conversation.

1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:54.480
 So he discovered like a reason he's new to this whole addiction and he just checks and

1:02:54.480 --> 1:03:04.160
 he like, he'll text me or write to me, I just passed Dawkins and I love that so much.

1:03:04.160 --> 1:03:05.160
 Yeah.

1:03:05.160 --> 1:03:09.800
 So he's, uh, can I tell you a funny story in that effect of like parental use of YouTube?

1:03:09.800 --> 1:03:14.480
 Uh, early on in the channel, uh, my mom would like text me.

1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:19.200
 She's like, uh, the channel, the channel has had 990,000 views.

1:03:19.200 --> 1:03:20.720
 The channel has had 991,000 views.

1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:22.040
 I'm like, oh, that's cute.

1:03:22.040 --> 1:03:24.880
 She's going to the little part on the about page where you see the total number of channel

1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:25.880
 views.

1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:27.880
 No, she didn't know about that.

1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:33.200
 She had been going every day through all the videos and then adding them up and she thought

1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:38.000
 she was like doing me this favor of providing me this like global analytic that, uh, otherwise

1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:39.000
 wouldn't be visible.

1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:40.000
 That's awesome.

1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:43.680
 It's just like this addiction where you have some number you want to follow and like, yeah,

1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:44.960
 it's funny that your dad had this.

1:03:44.960 --> 1:03:46.960
 I think a lot of people have it.

1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:52.080
 I think that's probably a beautiful thing for like parents cause they're legitimately,

1:03:52.080 --> 1:03:53.080
 they're proud.

1:03:53.080 --> 1:03:54.080
 Yeah.

1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:55.080
 It's, it's born of love.

1:03:55.080 --> 1:03:56.620
 It's great.

1:03:56.620 --> 1:04:03.800
 The downside, I feel one, one of them is this is one interesting experience that you probably

1:04:03.800 --> 1:04:07.560
 don't know much about cause comments on your videos are super positive.

1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:12.320
 Uh, but people judge the quality of how something went.

1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:16.200
 Like I see that with these conversations by the comments.

1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:17.200
 Yeah.

1:04:17.200 --> 1:04:22.440
 Like, I'm not talking about like, you know, people in their twenties and their thirties.

1:04:22.440 --> 1:04:27.120
 I'm talking about like CEOs of major companies who don't have time.

1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:31.620
 They basically, they literally, this is their evaluation metric.

1:04:31.620 --> 1:04:35.820
 They're like, Ooh, the comments seem to be positive and that's really concerning to me.

1:04:35.820 --> 1:04:40.320
 Most important lesson for any content creator to learn is that the commenting public is

1:04:40.320 --> 1:04:42.800
 not representative of the actual public.

1:04:42.800 --> 1:04:44.100
 And this is easy to see.

1:04:44.100 --> 1:04:47.400
 Ask yourself, how often do you write comments on YouTube videos?

1:04:47.400 --> 1:04:49.680
 Most people will realize I never do it.

1:04:49.680 --> 1:04:53.760
 Some people realize they do, but the people who realize they never do it should understand

1:04:53.760 --> 1:04:54.760
 that that's a sign.

1:04:54.760 --> 1:04:58.120
 The kind of people who are like you aren't the ones leaving comments.

1:04:58.120 --> 1:04:59.120
 And I think this is important.

1:04:59.120 --> 1:05:03.000
 A number of respects, like, uh, in my case, I think I would think my content was better

1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:06.360
 than it was if I just read comments cause people are super nice.

1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:10.920
 The thing is the people who are bored by it are, are put off by it in some way or frustrated

1:05:10.920 --> 1:05:11.960
 by it.

1:05:11.960 --> 1:05:13.420
 Usually they just go away.

1:05:13.420 --> 1:05:16.680
 You're certainly not going to watch the whole video, much less leave a comment on it.

1:05:16.680 --> 1:05:20.720
 So there's a huge under representation of like negative feedback, like well intentioned

1:05:20.720 --> 1:05:23.400
 negative feedback because very few people actively do that.

1:05:23.400 --> 1:05:26.820
 Like watch the whole thing that they dislike, figure out what they disliked, articulate

1:05:26.820 --> 1:05:27.820
 what they dislike.

1:05:27.820 --> 1:05:32.280
 Um, there's plenty of negative feedback that's not well intentioned, but um, for like that

1:05:32.280 --> 1:05:38.240
 golden kind, uh, I think a lot of YouTuber friends I have, uh, at least have gone through

1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:44.520
 phases of like anxiety about the nature of comments, um, that stem from basically just

1:05:44.520 --> 1:05:48.600
 this that it's like people who aren't necessarily representative of who they were going for

1:05:48.600 --> 1:05:52.640
 or misinterpreted what they're trying to say or whatever have you, or we're focusing on

1:05:52.640 --> 1:05:55.880
 things like personal appearances as opposed to like substance.

1:05:55.880 --> 1:05:59.480
 Um, and they come away thinking like, oh, that's what everyone thinks, right?

1:05:59.480 --> 1:06:01.720
 That's what everyone's response to this video was.

1:06:01.720 --> 1:06:05.680
 Um, but a lot of the people who had the reaction you wanted them to have, like they probably

1:06:05.680 --> 1:06:07.120
 didn't write it down.

1:06:07.120 --> 1:06:09.640
 So very important to learn.

1:06:09.640 --> 1:06:14.440
 It also translates to, um, realizing that you're not as important as you might think

1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:15.440
 you are, right?

1:06:15.440 --> 1:06:19.020
 Because all of the people commenting are the ones who love you the most and are like really

1:06:19.020 --> 1:06:22.280
 asking you to like create certain things or like mad that you didn't create like a past

1:06:22.280 --> 1:06:23.280
 thing.

1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:26.560
 Um, I don't, I have such a problem.

1:06:26.560 --> 1:06:30.060
 Like I have a very real problem with making promises about a type of content that I'll

1:06:30.060 --> 1:06:34.680
 make and then either not following up on it soon or just like never following up on it.

1:06:34.680 --> 1:06:35.680
 Yeah.

1:06:35.680 --> 1:06:38.840
 Like the last time we talked, I think prom, I'm not sure a promise to me that you'll have

1:06:38.840 --> 1:06:44.040
 music incorporated into your, like, uh, I'll share it with you a private link, but there's

1:06:44.040 --> 1:06:45.720
 an example of like what I had in mind.

1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:50.120
 I like did a version of it, um, and I'm like, Oh, I think there's a better version of this

1:06:50.120 --> 1:06:52.100
 that might exist one day.

1:06:52.100 --> 1:06:55.800
 So it's now on the, like the back burner, it's like, it's sitting there.

1:06:55.800 --> 1:06:59.400
 It was like a live performance at this one thing, I think next, next circumstance that

1:06:59.400 --> 1:07:03.740
 I'm like doing another recorded live performance that like fits having that then in a better

1:07:03.740 --> 1:07:06.040
 recording context, maybe I'll make it nice in public.

1:07:06.040 --> 1:07:08.040
 Maybe a while, but exactly.

1:07:08.040 --> 1:07:09.040
 Right.

1:07:09.040 --> 1:07:12.400
 Um, the point I was going to make those, like, I know I'm bad about following up on stuff,

1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:14.800
 uh, which is an actual problem.

1:07:14.800 --> 1:07:18.440
 It's born of the fact that I have a sense of what will be like good content when it

1:07:18.440 --> 1:07:19.440
 won't be.

1:07:19.440 --> 1:07:24.600
 Um, but this can actually be credibly disheartening because a ton of comments that I see are people

1:07:24.600 --> 1:07:29.160
 who are like, uh, frustrated, usually in a benevolent way that like I haven't followed

1:07:29.160 --> 1:07:32.680
 through on like X and X, which I get and I should do that.

1:07:32.680 --> 1:07:36.400
 But what's comforting thought for me is that when there's a topic I haven't promised, but

1:07:36.400 --> 1:07:40.600
 I am working on and I'm excited about, it's like the people who would really like this

1:07:40.600 --> 1:07:44.240
 don't know that it's coming and don't know to like comment to that effect and like the

1:07:44.240 --> 1:07:49.380
 commenting public that I'm seeing is not representative of like who I think this other project will

1:07:49.380 --> 1:07:50.380
 touch meaningfully.

1:07:50.380 --> 1:07:51.380
 Yeah.

1:07:51.380 --> 1:07:54.240
 So focus on the future on the thing you're creating now, just like the, uh, yeah, the

1:07:54.240 --> 1:07:55.240
 art of it.

1:07:55.240 --> 1:08:00.760
 One of the people is really inspiring to me in that regard because I've really seen it

1:08:00.760 --> 1:08:08.720
 in persons, um, Joe Rogan, he doesn't read comments, but not just that he doesn't give

1:08:08.720 --> 1:08:09.720
 a damn.

1:08:09.720 --> 1:08:10.720
 Hmm.

1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:13.960
 He like legitimate, he's not like clueless about it.

1:08:13.960 --> 1:08:19.800
 He's like, just like the richness and the depth of a smile he has when he just experiences

1:08:19.800 --> 1:08:28.420
 the moment with you like offline, you can tell he doesn't give a damn about like, like

1:08:28.420 --> 1:08:31.760
 about anything, about what people think about whether if it's on a podcast, you talk to

1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:36.480
 them or whether offline about just, it's not there.

1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:41.420
 Like what other people think, how, how, um, even like what the rest of the day looks like

1:08:41.420 --> 1:08:48.040
 is just deeply in the moment, uh, or like, especially like is, is what we're doing going

1:08:48.040 --> 1:08:50.720
 to make for a good Instagram photo or something like that?

1:08:50.720 --> 1:08:52.880
 It doesn't think like that at all.

1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:58.360
 It's I think for actually quite a lot of people, he's an inspiration in that way, but it was

1:08:58.360 --> 1:09:06.760
 and in real life, I show that you can be very successful, not giving a damn about, um, about

1:09:06.760 --> 1:09:07.760
 comments.

1:09:07.760 --> 1:09:12.940
 And it sounds, it sounds bad not to read comments cause it's like, well, there's a huge number

1:09:12.940 --> 1:09:15.120
 of people who are deeply passionate about what you do.

1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:20.760
 So you're what ignoring them, but at the same time, the nature of our platforms is such

1:09:20.760 --> 1:09:27.200
 that the cost of listening to all the positive people who are really close to you, who are

1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:32.240
 incredible people have been, you know, I've made a great community that you can learn

1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:40.840
 a lot from the cost of listening to those folks is also the cost of your psychology

1:09:40.840 --> 1:09:47.560
 slowly being degraded by the natural underlying toxicity of the internet.

1:09:47.560 --> 1:09:51.720
 Engage with a handful of people deeply rather than like as many people as you can in a shallow

1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:52.720
 way.

1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:55.000
 I think that's a good lesson for social media usage.

1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:00.160
 Um, like platforms in general, like choose, choose just a handful of things to engage

1:10:00.160 --> 1:10:03.720
 with and engage with it very well in a way that you feel proud of and don't worry about

1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:04.720
 the rest.

1:10:04.720 --> 1:10:09.400
 Honestly, I think the best social media platform is texting.

1:10:09.400 --> 1:10:10.400
 That's my favorite.

1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:12.080
 That's my go to social media platform.

1:10:12.080 --> 1:10:17.560
 Well, yeah, the best social media interactions like real life, not social media, but social

1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:18.560
 interaction.

1:10:18.560 --> 1:10:19.560
 Oh yeah.

1:10:19.560 --> 1:10:20.560
 No, no, no question there.

1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:21.560
 I think everyone should agree with that.

1:10:21.560 --> 1:10:26.440
 Which sucks because, uh, it's been challenged now with the current situation and we're trying

1:10:26.440 --> 1:10:31.560
 to figure out what kind of platform can be created that we can do remote communication

1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:32.560
 that still is effective.

1:10:32.560 --> 1:10:34.480
 It's important for education.

1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:38.040
 It's important for just the question of education right now.

1:10:38.040 --> 1:10:39.120
 Yeah.

1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:44.560
 So on that topic, uh, you've done a series of live streams called lockdown math and you

1:10:44.560 --> 1:10:48.920
 know, you want live, which is different than you usually do.

1:10:48.920 --> 1:10:53.160
 Maybe one, can you talk about how that feel?

1:10:53.160 --> 1:10:58.080
 What's that experience like like in your own, when you look back, like, is that an effective

1:10:58.080 --> 1:10:59.080
 way?

1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:01.040
 Did you find a being able to teach?

1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:07.720
 And if so, is there a lessons for this world where all of these educators are now trying

1:11:07.720 --> 1:11:11.120
 to figure out how the heck do I teach remotely?

1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:13.280
 For me, it was very different, as different as you can get.

1:11:13.280 --> 1:11:15.080
 I'm on camera, which I'm usually not.

1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:17.240
 I'm doing it live, which is nerve wracking.

1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:21.920
 Um, it was a slightly different like level of topics, although realistically I'm just

1:11:21.920 --> 1:11:24.360
 talking about things I'm interested in no matter what.

1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:28.520
 I think the reason I did that was this thought that a ton of people are looking to learn

1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:33.160
 remotely the rate at which I usually put out content is too slow to be actively helpful.

1:11:33.160 --> 1:11:36.880
 Let me just do some biweekly lectures that if you're looking for a place to point your

1:11:36.880 --> 1:11:39.920
 students, if you're a student looking for a place to be edified about math, just tune

1:11:39.920 --> 1:11:40.920
 in at these times.

1:11:40.920 --> 1:11:45.000
 Um, and in that sense, I think it was, you know, a success for those who followed with

1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:46.000
 it.

1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:50.240
 It was a really rewarding experience for me to see how people engaged with it.

1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:54.800
 Um, part of the fun of the live interaction was to actually like I do these live quizzes

1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:57.820
 and see how people would answer and try to shape the lesson based on that or see what

1:11:57.820 --> 1:11:59.960
 questions people were asking in the audience.

1:11:59.960 --> 1:12:03.880
 I would love to, if I did more things like that in the future, kind of tighten that feedback

1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:05.440
 loop even more.

1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:10.960
 Um, I think for, you know, you asked about like if this can be relevant to educators,

1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:15.040
 like 100% online teaching is basically a form of live streaming now.

1:12:15.040 --> 1:12:17.280
 Um, and usually it happens through zoom.

1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:22.440
 I think if teachers view what they're doing as a kind of performance and a kind of live

1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:27.660
 stream performance, um, that would probably be pretty healthy because zoom can be kind

1:12:27.660 --> 1:12:28.660
 of awkward.

1:12:28.660 --> 1:12:32.820
 Um, and I brought up this little blog post actually just on like just what our setup

1:12:32.820 --> 1:12:37.040
 looked like if you want to adopt it yourself and how to integrate, um, like the broadcasting

1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:39.400
 software OBS with zoom or things like that.

1:12:39.400 --> 1:12:40.880
 It was really sorry to pause on that.

1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:45.560
 I mean, yeah, maybe we could look at the blog post, but it looked really nice.

1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:48.440
 The thing is, I knew nothing about any of that stuff before I started.

1:12:48.440 --> 1:12:50.320
 I had a friend who knew a fair bit.

1:12:50.320 --> 1:12:52.640
 Um, and so he kind of helped show me the routes.

1:12:52.640 --> 1:12:57.080
 One of the things that I realized is that you could, as a teacher, like it doesn't take

1:12:57.080 --> 1:12:59.680
 that much to make things look and feel pretty professional.

1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:04.160
 Um, like one component of it is as soon as you hook things up with the broadcasting software,

1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:07.840
 rather than just doing like screen sharing, you can set up different scenes and then you

1:13:07.840 --> 1:13:11.320
 can like have keyboard shortcuts to transition between those scenes.

1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:14.560
 So you don't need a production studio with a director calling like, go to camera three,

1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:17.040
 go to camera two, like onto the screen capture.

1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:18.820
 Instead you can have control of that.

1:13:18.820 --> 1:13:21.800
 And it took a little bit of practice and I would mess it up now and then, but I think

1:13:21.800 --> 1:13:25.800
 I had it decently smooth such that, you know, I'm talking to the camera and then we're doing

1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:26.800
 something on the paper.

1:13:26.800 --> 1:13:31.080
 Then we're doing like a, um, playing with a Desmos graph or something.

1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:34.240
 And something that I think in the past would have required a production team, you can actually

1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:38.000
 do as a solo operation, um, and in particular as a teacher.

1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:42.760
 And I think it's worth it to try to do that because, uh, two reasons, one, you might get

1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:46.400
 more engagement from the students, but the biggest reason I think one of the like best

1:13:46.400 --> 1:13:50.440
 things that can come out of this pandemic education wise is if we turn a bunch of teachers

1:13:50.440 --> 1:13:51.920
 into content creators.

1:13:51.920 --> 1:13:55.920
 And if we take lessons that are usually done in these one off settings and like start to

1:13:55.920 --> 1:14:01.300
 get in the habit of, um, sometimes I'll use the phrase commoditizing explanation where

1:14:01.300 --> 1:14:06.680
 what you want is whatever a thing a student wants to learn.

1:14:06.680 --> 1:14:11.020
 It just seems inefficient to me that that lesson is taught millions of times over in

1:14:11.020 --> 1:14:14.160
 parallel across many different classrooms in the world.

1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:18.120
 Like year to year, you've got a given algebra one lesson that's just taught like literally

1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:21.640
 millions of times, um, by different people.

1:14:21.640 --> 1:14:27.080
 What should happen is that there's the small handful of explanations online, uh, that exists

1:14:27.080 --> 1:14:30.640
 so that when someone needs that explanation, they can go to it, that the time in classroom

1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:34.040
 is spent on all of the parts of teaching and education that aren't explanation, which is

1:14:34.040 --> 1:14:35.400
 most of it.

1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:36.400
 Right.

1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:40.720
 Um, and the way to get there is to basically have more people who are already explaining,

1:14:40.720 --> 1:14:43.960
 publish their explanations and have it in a publicized forum.

1:14:43.960 --> 1:14:49.340
 So if during a pandemic you can have people automatically creating online content cause

1:14:49.340 --> 1:14:53.400
 it has to be online, but getting into the habit of doing it in a, um, in a way that

1:14:53.400 --> 1:14:57.800
 doesn't just feel like a zoom call that happened to be recorded, but it actually feels like

1:14:57.800 --> 1:15:03.680
 a, a piece that was always going to be publicized to more people than just your students that

1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:05.480
 can be really powerful.

1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:11.160
 And there's an improvement process there, like so being self critical and growing, like,

1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:17.680
 you know, like I guess YouTubers go through this process of like putting out some content

1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:24.000
 and like nobody caring about it and then trying to figure out like, and basically improving

1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:28.000
 figure out like, why did nobody care?

1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:31.280
 What can I, you know, and they come up with all kinds of answers, which may or may not

1:15:31.280 --> 1:15:35.600
 be correct, but doesn't matter because the answer leads to improvement.

1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:40.520
 So you're being constantly self critical, self analytical, it should be better to say.

1:15:40.520 --> 1:15:43.060
 So you think of like, how can I make the audio better?

1:15:43.060 --> 1:15:45.680
 Like all the basic things.

1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:52.240
 Maybe one, one question to ask, cause, uh, well, by way of, uh, Russ Tedrick is a robotics

1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:55.920
 professor at MIT, one of my favorite people, a big fan of yours.

1:15:55.920 --> 1:15:57.720
 Uh, he watched our first conversation.

1:15:57.720 --> 1:16:01.320
 I just interviewed him a couple of weeks ago.

1:16:01.320 --> 1:16:08.320
 He, uh, he teaches this course in the under actuated robotics, which is, um, like robotic

1:16:08.320 --> 1:16:13.560
 systems when you can't control everything, like when you're like, we as humans, when

1:16:13.560 --> 1:16:17.680
 we walk, we're always falling forward, which means like it's gravity.

1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:18.680
 You can't control it.

1:16:18.680 --> 1:16:21.800
 You just hope you can catch yourself, but that's not all guaranteed.

1:16:21.800 --> 1:16:23.000
 It depends on the surface.

1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:24.480
 So like that's under actuated.

1:16:24.480 --> 1:16:26.360
 You can't control everything.

1:16:26.360 --> 1:16:31.760
 The number of actuators, uh, the degrees of freedoms you have is not enough to fully control

1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:32.760
 the system.

1:16:32.760 --> 1:16:33.760
 So I don't know.

1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:35.680
 It's a really, I think, beautiful, fascinating class.

1:16:35.680 --> 1:16:37.240
 He puts it online.

1:16:37.240 --> 1:16:39.040
 Um, it's quite popular.

1:16:39.040 --> 1:16:40.440
 He does an incredible job teaching.

1:16:40.440 --> 1:16:45.240
 He puts it online every time, but he's kind of been interested in like crisping it up,

1:16:45.240 --> 1:16:50.480
 like, you know, making it, uh, you know, innovating in different kinds of ways.

1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:56.280
 And he was inspired by the work you do, because I think in his work, he can do similar kinds

1:16:56.280 --> 1:17:01.240
 of explanations as you're doing, like revealing the beauty of it and spending like months

1:17:01.240 --> 1:17:03.360
 in preparing a single video.

1:17:03.360 --> 1:17:06.360
 Uh, and he's interested in how to do that.

1:17:06.360 --> 1:17:07.840
 That's why he listened to the conversation.

1:17:07.840 --> 1:17:16.000
 He's playing with manum, but he had this question of, you know, um, of, uh, you know, like in

1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:21.520
 my apartment where we did the interview, I have like curtains, like the, for like a black

1:17:21.520 --> 1:17:28.800
 curtain, not this, uh, this is, this is a adjacent mansion that we're in that I also,

1:17:28.800 --> 1:17:33.600
 uh, but you basically just have, I have like a black curtain, whatever that, you know,

1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:38.080
 makes it really easy to set up a filming situation with cameras that we have here, these microphones.

1:17:38.080 --> 1:17:41.560
 He was asking, you know, what kind of equipment do you recommend?

1:17:41.560 --> 1:17:43.640
 I guess like your blog post is a good one.

1:17:43.640 --> 1:17:49.000
 I said, I don't recommend this is excessive and actually really hard to work with.

1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:55.160
 So I wonder, I mean, uh, is there something you would recommend in terms of equipment?

1:17:55.160 --> 1:18:00.880
 Like is, is it, do you re do you think like lapel mics, like USB mics, what do you, for

1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:06.280
 my narration, I use a USB mic for the streams that used to lapel mic, uh, the narration,

1:18:06.280 --> 1:18:07.280
 it's a blue Yeti.

1:18:07.280 --> 1:18:12.120
 Um, I'm forgetting actually the name of the lapel mic, but it was probably like a road

1:18:12.120 --> 1:18:13.680
 of some kind.

1:18:13.680 --> 1:18:17.120
 Um, but is it hard to figure out how to make the audio sound good?

1:18:17.120 --> 1:18:21.600
 Oh, I mean, listen to all the early videos on my channel and clearly like I'm terrible

1:18:21.600 --> 1:18:23.640
 at this for, for some reason.

1:18:23.640 --> 1:18:25.760
 Um, I just couldn't get audio for awhile.

1:18:25.760 --> 1:18:28.120
 I think I, it's weird when you hear your own voice.

1:18:28.120 --> 1:18:31.820
 So you hear it, you're like, this sounds weird and it's hard to notice it sound weird because

1:18:31.820 --> 1:18:36.160
 you're not used to your own voice or they're like actual audio artifacts at play.

1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:43.120
 Um, so, uh, and then video is just for the lockdown, just the camera, like you said,

1:18:43.120 --> 1:18:47.260
 it was probably streaming somehow through the, yeah, there were two GH five cameras.

1:18:47.260 --> 1:18:49.520
 One that was mounted overhead over a piece of paper.

1:18:49.520 --> 1:18:53.640
 You could also use like an iPad or a Wacom tablet to do your writing electronically,

1:18:53.640 --> 1:18:57.840
 but I just wanted the paper feel, um, one on the face.

1:18:57.840 --> 1:18:58.840
 There's two.

1:18:58.840 --> 1:19:02.400
 Um, again, I don't know, I'm like just not actually the one to ask this cause I like

1:19:02.400 --> 1:19:08.400
 animate stuff usually, but, uh, each of them like has a compressor object that makes it

1:19:08.400 --> 1:19:12.880
 such that the camera output goes into the computer USB, but like gets compressed before

1:19:12.880 --> 1:19:13.880
 it does that.

1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:20.120
 The, the live aspect of it, do you, do you regret doing it live?

1:19:20.120 --> 1:19:21.120
 Not at all.

1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:26.360
 Um, I think I do think the content might be like much less sharp and tight than if it

1:19:26.360 --> 1:19:30.360
 were something, even that I just recorded like that and then edited later.

1:19:30.360 --> 1:19:34.080
 But I do like something that I do to be out there to show like, Hey, this is what it's

1:19:34.080 --> 1:19:35.080
 like.

1:19:35.080 --> 1:19:36.080
 Raw.

1:19:36.080 --> 1:19:37.080
 This is what it's like when I make mistakes.

1:19:37.080 --> 1:19:41.240
 Um, this is like the pace of thinking, um, I like the live interaction of it.

1:19:41.240 --> 1:19:42.760
 I think that made it better.

1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:45.480
 Uh, I probably would do it on a different channel.

1:19:45.480 --> 1:19:49.120
 I think, um, if I did series like that in the future, just because it's, it's a different

1:19:49.120 --> 1:19:50.120
 style.

1:19:50.120 --> 1:19:53.240
 It's probably a different target audience and, um, kind of keep clean what three blue

1:19:53.240 --> 1:19:58.080
 and brown is about versus, uh, the benefits of like live lectures.

1:19:58.080 --> 1:20:04.280
 Do you, uh, suggest like in this time of COVID that people like Russ or other educators tried

1:20:04.280 --> 1:20:12.080
 to go like the, the shorter, like 20 minute videos that are like really well planned out

1:20:12.080 --> 1:20:13.080
 or scripted.

1:20:13.080 --> 1:20:15.680
 You really think through, you slowly design.

1:20:15.680 --> 1:20:16.680
 So it's not live.

1:20:16.680 --> 1:20:20.360
 Do you see like that being an important part of, um, what they do?

1:20:20.360 --> 1:20:21.360
 Yeah.

1:20:21.360 --> 1:20:25.880
 Well, what I think teachers like Russ should do is, um, choose the small handful of topics

1:20:25.880 --> 1:20:27.400
 that they're going to do just really well.

1:20:27.400 --> 1:20:31.320
 They want to create the best short explanation of it in the world that will be one of those

1:20:31.320 --> 1:20:35.160
 handfuls in a world where you have commoditized explanation, right?

1:20:35.160 --> 1:20:37.440
 Most of the lectures should be done just normally.

1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:39.040
 Um, so put thought and planning into it.

1:20:39.040 --> 1:20:42.920
 I'm sure he's a wonderful teacher and like knows all about that, but maybe choose those

1:20:42.920 --> 1:20:44.440
 small handful of topics.

1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:49.560
 Um, do what beneficial for me sometimes is I do sample lessons with people on that topic

1:20:49.560 --> 1:20:52.560
 to get some sense of how other people think about it.

1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:56.840
 Let that inform how you want to, um, edit it or script it or whatever format you want

1:20:56.840 --> 1:20:57.840
 to do.

1:20:57.840 --> 1:20:59.960
 Some people are comfortable just explaining it and editing later.

1:20:59.960 --> 1:21:02.640
 I'm more comfortable like writing it out and thinking in that setting.

1:21:02.640 --> 1:21:03.640
 Yeah.

1:21:03.640 --> 1:21:04.640
 It's kind of sad.

1:21:04.640 --> 1:21:05.640
 Sorry to interrupt.

1:21:05.640 --> 1:21:10.960
 Uh, it's, it's a little bit sad to me to see how much knowledge is lost.

1:21:10.960 --> 1:21:16.200
 Like just, just like you mentioned, there's professors, like we can take my dad, for example,

1:21:16.200 --> 1:21:21.800
 to blow up his ego a little bit, but he's a, he's a great teacher and he knows plasma,

1:21:21.800 --> 1:21:23.900
 plasma chemistry, plasma physics really well.

1:21:23.900 --> 1:21:31.520
 So he can very simply explain some beautiful, but otherwise, uh, complicated concepts.

1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:37.520
 And it's sad that like, if you Google plasma or like for plasma physics, like there's no

1:21:37.520 --> 1:21:38.520
 videos.

1:21:38.520 --> 1:21:43.120
 And just imagine if every one of those excellent teachers like your father or like Russ, um,

1:21:43.120 --> 1:21:46.940
 even if they just chose one topic this year, they're like, I'm going to make the best video

1:21:46.940 --> 1:21:48.160
 that I can on this topic.

1:21:48.160 --> 1:21:52.360
 If every one of the great teachers did that, the internet would be replete and it's already

1:21:52.360 --> 1:21:53.800
 replete with great explanations.

1:21:53.800 --> 1:21:56.840
 But it would be even more so with all the niche, great explanations and like anything

1:21:56.840 --> 1:21:57.840
 you want to learn.

1:21:57.840 --> 1:22:02.480
 Um, and there's a self interest to it for, in terms of teachers, in terms of even, so

1:22:02.480 --> 1:22:08.160
 if you take Russ, for example, it's not that he's teaching something like he teaches his

1:22:08.160 --> 1:22:11.600
 main thing, his thing he's deeply passionate about.

1:22:11.600 --> 1:22:20.360
 And from a selfish perspective, it's also just like, I mean, it's a, it's a, it's like

1:22:20.360 --> 1:22:27.680
 publishing a paper in a really, uh, like nature has like letters, like accessible publication.

1:22:27.680 --> 1:22:35.500
 It's just going to guarantee that your work, that your passion is seen by a huge number

1:22:35.500 --> 1:22:39.080
 of people, whatever the definition of huge is, doesn't matter.

1:22:39.080 --> 1:22:42.400
 It's much more than it otherwise, uh, would be.

1:22:42.400 --> 1:22:47.960
 And it's those lectures that tell early students what to be interested in at the moment.

1:22:47.960 --> 1:22:51.360
 I think students are disproportionately interested in the things that are well represented on

1:22:51.360 --> 1:22:52.440
 YouTube.

1:22:52.440 --> 1:22:56.000
 So to any educator out there, if you're wondering, Hey, I want more like grad students in my

1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:59.000
 department, like what's the best way to recruit grad students?

1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:02.040
 It's like, make the best video you can and then wait eight years.

1:23:02.040 --> 1:23:05.560
 And then you're going to have a pile of like excellent grad students for that department.

1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:12.920
 And one of the lessons I think your channel teaches is there's appeal of explaining just

1:23:12.920 --> 1:23:19.680
 something beautiful, explaining it cleanly, technically not doing a marketing video about

1:23:19.680 --> 1:23:21.120
 why topology is great.

1:23:21.120 --> 1:23:24.000
 There's yeah, that's the, there's people interested in this stuff.

1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:29.280
 I mean, uh, one of the greatest channels like Matt, it's not even a math channel, but the

1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:33.200
 channel with greatest math content is Vsauce, like interviewed.

1:23:33.200 --> 1:23:38.800
 If imagine you were to propose making a video that explains the Banach Tarski paradox substantively,

1:23:38.800 --> 1:23:39.800
 right?

1:23:39.800 --> 1:23:45.440
 Like not shying around it, maybe not describing things in terms of, um, like the group theoretic

1:23:45.440 --> 1:23:51.920
 terminology that you'd usually see in a paper, but the actual results, um, that went into

1:23:51.920 --> 1:23:56.160
 this idea of like breaking apart a sphere, proposing that to like a network TV station

1:23:56.160 --> 1:23:59.880
 saying, yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to do this in depth talk of the Banach Tarski paradox.

1:23:59.880 --> 1:24:02.120
 I'm pretty sure it's going to reach 20 million people.

1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:04.000
 It's like, get out of here.

1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:05.760
 Like no, no one cares about that.

1:24:05.760 --> 1:24:08.720
 No one's interested in anything even anywhere near that.

1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:11.060
 But then you have Michael's quirky personality around it.

1:24:11.060 --> 1:24:16.200
 And just people that are actually hungry for that kind of depth, um, then you don't need

1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:19.280
 like the approval of some higher network.

1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:22.080
 You can just do it and let the people speak for themselves.

1:24:22.080 --> 1:24:26.720
 So I think, you know, if your father was to make something on plasma physics or, um, if

1:24:26.720 --> 1:24:32.680
 we were to have like, uh, underactualized robotics, underactuated, underactuated, yes,

1:24:32.680 --> 1:24:37.360
 not underactualized, plenty actualized underactuated robotics.

1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:41.520
 Robotics is under actualized currently.

1:24:41.520 --> 1:24:46.100
 So even if it's things that you might think are niche, I bet you'll be surprised by how

1:24:46.100 --> 1:24:49.360
 many people, um, actually engage with it really deeply.

1:24:49.360 --> 1:24:52.720
 Although I just psychologically watching him, I can't speak for a lot of people.

1:24:52.720 --> 1:24:53.880
 I can speak for my dad.

1:24:53.880 --> 1:25:00.200
 I think there's a, there's a little bit of a skill gap, but I think that could be overcome.

1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:01.200
 That's pretty basic.

1:25:01.200 --> 1:25:04.160
 None of us know how to make videos when we start the first stuff I made was terrible

1:25:04.160 --> 1:25:05.160
 in a number of respects.

1:25:05.160 --> 1:25:09.280
 Like look at the earliest videos I need in the YouTube channel, except for captain disillusion.

1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:13.480
 And they're all like terrible versions of whatever they are now.

1:25:13.480 --> 1:25:19.480
 But the thing I've noticed, especially like with world experts is it's the same thing

1:25:19.480 --> 1:25:25.320
 that I'm sure you went through, which is like, um, fear of like embarrassment.

1:25:25.320 --> 1:25:29.720
 Like they, they definitely, it's, it's the same reason.

1:25:29.720 --> 1:25:35.120
 Like I feel that anytime I put out a video, I don't know if you still feel that.

1:25:35.120 --> 1:25:39.360
 But like, I don't know, it's this imposter syndrome.

1:25:39.360 --> 1:25:41.040
 Like who am I to talk about this?

1:25:41.040 --> 1:25:46.320
 And that that's true for like even things that you've studied for like your whole life.

1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:47.400
 Uh, I don't know.

1:25:47.400 --> 1:25:50.160
 It's scary to post stuff on YouTube.

1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:51.160
 It is scary.

1:25:51.160 --> 1:25:57.700
 Uh, I honestly wish that more of the people who had that modesty to say, who am I to

1:25:57.700 --> 1:25:58.700
 post this?

1:25:58.700 --> 1:26:00.200
 We're the ones actually posting it.

1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:01.200
 That's right.

1:26:01.200 --> 1:26:04.680
 I mean, the honest problem is like a lot of the educational content is posted by people

1:26:04.680 --> 1:26:09.680
 who like, we're just starting to research it two weeks ago and are on a certain schedule

1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:15.960
 and who maybe should think like, who am I to explain and choose your favorite topic,

1:26:15.960 --> 1:26:17.720
 quantum mechanics or something.

1:26:17.720 --> 1:26:23.760
 Um, and the people who have the self awareness, uh, to not post are probably the people also

1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:27.400
 best positioned to give a good, honest explanation of it.

1:26:27.400 --> 1:26:32.480
 That's why there's a lot of value in a channel like numberphile where they basically trap

1:26:32.480 --> 1:26:38.240
 a really smart person and force them to explain stuff on a bronze sheet of paper.

1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:41.760
 So, but of course that's not scalable as a single channel.

1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:45.640
 If they, if there's anything beautiful that it could be done as people take it in their

1:26:45.640 --> 1:26:51.220
 own hands, uh, educators, which is again, circling back, I do think the pandemic will

1:26:51.220 --> 1:26:54.560
 serve to force a lot of people's hands.

1:26:54.560 --> 1:26:56.940
 You're going to be making online content anyway.

1:26:56.940 --> 1:26:58.940
 It's happening, right?

1:26:58.940 --> 1:27:01.520
 Just hit that publish button and see how it goes.

1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:02.720
 Yeah.

1:27:02.720 --> 1:27:03.720
 See how it goes.

1:27:03.720 --> 1:27:10.040
 The cool thing about YouTube is it might not go for a while, but like 10 years later, right?

1:27:10.040 --> 1:27:11.040
 Yeah.

1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:14.440
 It'll be like, this, the thing this, what people don't understand with YouTube, at least

1:27:14.440 --> 1:27:20.000
 for now, at least that's my hope with it is, uh, it's a leg.

1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:24.800
 It's a, it's literally better than publishing a book in terms of the legacy.

1:27:24.800 --> 1:27:27.800
 It's it will live for a long, long time.

1:27:27.800 --> 1:27:34.480
 Of course it's, um, one of the things I mentioned Joe Rogan before, it's kinda, there's a sad

1:27:34.480 --> 1:27:36.640
 thing cause I'm a fan.

1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:38.240
 He's moving to Spotify.

1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:39.240
 Yeah.

1:27:39.240 --> 1:27:40.240
 Yeah.

1:27:40.240 --> 1:27:41.800
 Nine digit numbers will do that to you.

1:27:41.800 --> 1:27:42.800
 Yeah.

1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:46.040
 But he doesn't really that he was one of the person that doesn't actually care that much

1:27:46.040 --> 1:27:47.040
 about money.

1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:50.900
 Like having talked to him here, it wasn't because of money.

1:27:50.900 --> 1:27:58.880
 It's because he legitimately thinks that they're going to do like a better job.

1:27:58.880 --> 1:28:03.040
 Like, so they're, so from his perspective, YouTube, you have to understand where they're

1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:04.040
 coming from.

1:28:04.040 --> 1:28:10.880
 YouTube has been cracking down on people who they, you know, Joe Rogan talks to Alex Jones

1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:13.120
 and conspiracy theories and stuff.

1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:16.480
 And YouTube is really like careful that kind of stuff.

1:28:16.480 --> 1:28:18.400
 And that's not a good feeling.

1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:22.760
 Like, and Joe didn't, doesn't feel like YouTube was on his side.

1:28:22.760 --> 1:28:28.680
 You know, he's often has videos that they don't put in trending that like are obviously

1:28:28.680 --> 1:28:34.720
 should be in trending because they're nervous about like, you know, if this concert is this,

1:28:34.720 --> 1:28:41.520
 is this content going to, you know, upset people that all that kind of stuff have misinformation.

1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:44.320
 And that's not a good place for a person to be in.

1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:48.480
 And Spotify is giving them a, we're never going to censor you.

1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:50.360
 We're never going to do that.

1:28:50.360 --> 1:28:55.120
 But the reason I bring that up, whatever you think about that, I personally think as bullshit

1:28:55.120 --> 1:28:59.640
 because podcasting should be free and not constrained to a platform.

1:28:59.640 --> 1:29:00.640
 It's pirate radio.

1:29:00.640 --> 1:29:01.640
 What the hell?

1:29:01.640 --> 1:29:08.360
 You can't, as much as I love Spotify, you can't just, you can't put fences around it.

1:29:08.360 --> 1:29:13.480
 But anyway, the reason I bring that up is Joe's going to remove his entire library from

1:29:13.480 --> 1:29:14.480
 YouTube.

1:29:14.480 --> 1:29:15.480
 Whoa, really?

1:29:15.480 --> 1:29:16.480
 I didn't know that.

1:29:16.480 --> 1:29:20.640
 His full length, the clips are going to stay, but the full length videos are all, I mean,

1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:22.320
 made private or deleted.

1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:23.660
 That's part of the deal.

1:29:23.660 --> 1:29:29.200
 And like, that's the first time where I was like, Oh, YouTube videos might not live forever.

1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:32.640
 Like things you find like, okay, I'm sorry.

1:29:32.640 --> 1:29:36.960
 This is why you need an IPFS or something where it's like, if there's a content link,

1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:39.300
 are you familiar with this system at all?

1:29:39.300 --> 1:29:41.920
 Like right now, if you have a URL, it points to a server.

1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:46.240
 There's like a system where the address points to content and then it's like distributed.

1:29:46.240 --> 1:29:50.920
 So you, you can't actually delete what's at an address because it's, it's content addressed.

1:29:50.920 --> 1:29:54.500
 And as long as there's someone on the network who hosts it, it's always accessible at the

1:29:54.500 --> 1:29:56.860
 address that it once was.

1:29:56.860 --> 1:29:58.600
 But I mean, that raises a question.

1:29:58.600 --> 1:30:03.420
 I'm not going to put you on the spot, but like somebody like Vsauce, right?

1:30:03.420 --> 1:30:07.800
 Spotify comes along and gives him, let's say $100 billion.

1:30:07.800 --> 1:30:08.800
 Okay.

1:30:08.800 --> 1:30:13.160
 Let's say some crazy number and then removes it from YouTube, right?

1:30:13.160 --> 1:30:19.840
 It's made me, I don't know, for some reason I thought YouTube is forever.

1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:20.840
 I don't think it will be.

1:30:20.840 --> 1:30:25.560
 I mean, you know, another variant that this might take is like, uh, that, you know, um,

1:30:25.560 --> 1:30:30.360
 you fast forward 50 years and, uh, you know, Google or Alphabet isn't the company that

1:30:30.360 --> 1:30:31.360
 it once was.

1:30:31.360 --> 1:30:33.240
 And it's kind of struggling to make ends meet.

1:30:33.240 --> 1:30:38.360
 And you know, it's been supplanted by the whoever wins on the AR game or whatever it

1:30:38.360 --> 1:30:39.640
 might be.

1:30:39.640 --> 1:30:43.880
 And then they're like, you know, all of these videos that we're hosting are pretty costly.

1:30:43.880 --> 1:30:47.680
 So we're just, we're going to start deleting the ones that aren't watched that much and

1:30:47.680 --> 1:30:51.560
 tell people to like try to back them up on their own or whatever it is.

1:30:51.560 --> 1:30:56.520
 Um, or even if it does exist in some form forever, it's like if people are, um, not

1:30:56.520 --> 1:30:59.600
 habituated to watching YouTube in 50 years, they're watching something else, which seems

1:30:59.600 --> 1:31:00.600
 pretty likely.

1:31:00.600 --> 1:31:06.040
 Like it would be shocking if YouTube remained as popular as it is now indefinitely into

1:31:06.040 --> 1:31:07.520
 the future.

1:31:07.520 --> 1:31:10.160
 So, uh, it won't be forever.

1:31:10.160 --> 1:31:16.160
 Makes me sad still, but cause it's such a nice, it's just like you said of the canonical

1:31:16.160 --> 1:31:17.160
 videos.

1:31:17.160 --> 1:31:18.160
 Sorry.

1:31:18.160 --> 1:31:19.160
 I didn't mean to interrupt.

1:31:19.160 --> 1:31:21.800
 You know, you should get Juan Bennett on the, uh, on the thing and then talk to him about

1:31:21.800 --> 1:31:22.800
 permanence.

1:31:22.800 --> 1:31:24.400
 I think you would have a good conversation.

1:31:24.400 --> 1:31:25.400
 Who's that?

1:31:25.400 --> 1:31:28.880
 So he's the one that founded this thing called IPFS that I'm talking about.

1:31:28.880 --> 1:31:32.560
 And if you have him talk about basically what you're describing, like, Oh, it's sad that

1:31:32.560 --> 1:31:33.560
 this isn't forever.

1:31:33.560 --> 1:31:38.160
 Then you'll get some articulate pontification around it that's like been pretty well thought

1:31:38.160 --> 1:31:39.160
 through.

1:31:39.160 --> 1:31:44.040
 Uh, but yeah, I do see YouTube, just like you said, as a, as a place, like what your

1:31:44.040 --> 1:31:47.880
 channel creates, which is like a set of canonical videos on a topic.

1:31:47.880 --> 1:31:54.560
 Now others could create videos on that topic as well, but as a collection, it creates a

1:31:54.560 --> 1:31:56.480
 nice set of places to go.

1:31:56.480 --> 1:32:02.320
 Uh, if you're curious about a particular topic and it seems like coronavirus is a nice opportunity

1:32:02.320 --> 1:32:10.680
 to, uh, put that knowledge out there in the world at, uh, MIT and beyond, I have to talk

1:32:10.680 --> 1:32:13.440
 to you a little bit about machine learning, deep learning and so on.

1:32:13.440 --> 1:32:19.560
 Again, we talked about last time you have a set of beautiful videos on neural networks.

1:32:19.560 --> 1:32:28.160
 Uh, let me ask you first, what is the most beautiful aspect of neural networks and machine

1:32:28.160 --> 1:32:35.320
 learning to you, like for making those videos from watching how the field is evolving?

1:32:35.320 --> 1:32:42.560
 Is there something mathematically or in applied sense, just beautiful to you about them?

1:32:42.560 --> 1:32:48.320
 Well, I think what I would go to is the layered structure and how, um, you can have what feel

1:32:48.320 --> 1:32:52.960
 like qualitatively distinct things happening, going from one layer to another, but that

1:32:52.960 --> 1:32:56.960
 are, um, following the same mathematical rule because you look at it as a piece of math.

1:32:56.960 --> 1:33:00.720
 It's like you got a non linearity and then you've got a matrix multiplication.

1:33:00.720 --> 1:33:02.400
 That's what's happening on all the layers.

1:33:02.400 --> 1:33:06.880
 Um, but especially if you look at like some of the visualizations that, uh, like Chris

1:33:06.880 --> 1:33:12.640
 Ola has done with respect to, um, like convolutional nets that have been trained on image net trying

1:33:12.640 --> 1:33:14.120
 to say, what does this neuron do?

1:33:14.120 --> 1:33:17.440
 What do this, uh, does this family of neurons do?

1:33:17.440 --> 1:33:22.260
 What you can see is that, um, the ones closer to the input side are picking up on very low

1:33:22.260 --> 1:33:24.720
 level ideas like the texture, right?

1:33:24.720 --> 1:33:26.920
 And then as you get further back, you have higher level ideas.

1:33:26.920 --> 1:33:29.200
 Like what is the, where are the eyes in this picture?

1:33:29.200 --> 1:33:33.760
 And then how do the eyes form like an animal is this animal, a cat or a dog or a deer.

1:33:33.760 --> 1:33:37.800
 You have this series of qualitatively different things happening, even though it's the same

1:33:37.800 --> 1:33:39.680
 piece of math on each one.

1:33:39.680 --> 1:33:44.760
 So that's a pretty beautiful idea that you can have like a generalizable object that,

1:33:44.760 --> 1:33:50.220
 um, runs through the layers of abstraction, which in some sense constitute intelligence

1:33:50.220 --> 1:33:55.720
 is having, um, those many different layers of an understanding to something form abstractions

1:33:55.720 --> 1:33:57.640
 in a automated way.

1:33:57.640 --> 1:33:58.640
 Exactly.

1:33:58.640 --> 1:34:02.160
 It's automated abstracting, which, I mean, that just feels very powerful.

1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:06.200
 Um, and the idea that it can be so simply mathematically represented.

1:34:06.200 --> 1:34:10.360
 I mean, a ton of like modern ML research seems a little bit like you do a bunch of ad hoc

1:34:10.360 --> 1:34:14.000
 things, then you decide which one worked and then you retrospectively come up with the

1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:16.240
 mathematical reason that it always had to work.

1:34:16.240 --> 1:34:19.820
 Um, but you know, who cares how you came to it when you have like that elegant piece of

1:34:19.820 --> 1:34:20.820
 math?

1:34:20.820 --> 1:34:24.440
 Uh, it's hard not to just smile seeing it work in action.

1:34:24.440 --> 1:34:30.880
 Well, and when you talked about topology before, one of the really interesting things is, is

1:34:30.880 --> 1:34:34.560
 beginning to be investigated under kind of the field of like science and deep learning,

1:34:34.560 --> 1:34:42.920
 which is like the craziness of the surface that, uh, is trying to be optimized, uh, in

1:34:42.920 --> 1:34:43.920
 neural networks.

1:34:43.920 --> 1:34:51.520
 I mean, the, the amount of local minima, local optima there is in these surfaces and somehow

1:34:51.520 --> 1:34:55.640
 a dumb gradient descent algorithm was able to find really good solutions.

1:34:55.640 --> 1:34:58.280
 That's like, that's really surprising.

1:34:58.280 --> 1:35:04.200
 Well, so on the one hand it is, but also it's like not, it's not terribly surprising that

1:35:04.200 --> 1:35:08.880
 you have these interesting points that exist when you make your space so high dimensional,

1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:10.880
 like GPT three, what did it have?

1:35:10.880 --> 1:35:12.640
 175 billion parameters.

1:35:12.640 --> 1:35:19.900
 So it doesn't feel as mesmerizing to think about, Oh, there's some surface of intelligent

1:35:19.900 --> 1:35:21.760
 behavior in this crazy high dimensional space.

1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:24.840
 It's like, there's so many parameters that of course, but what's more interesting is

1:35:24.840 --> 1:35:28.940
 like, how, how is it that you're able to efficiently get there, which is maybe what you're describing

1:35:28.940 --> 1:35:35.120
 that something as dumb as gradient descent does it, but like the re the reason that gradient

1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:38.920
 descent works well with neural networks and not just, you know, choose however you want

1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:42.640
 to parameterize this space and then like apply gradient descent to it is that that layered

1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:47.160
 structure lets you decompose the derivative in a way that makes it computationally feasible.

1:35:47.160 --> 1:35:54.160
 Um, yeah, it's just that, that there's so many good solutions, probably infinitely infinitely

1:35:54.160 --> 1:35:58.780
 many good solutions, not best solutions, but good solutions.

1:35:58.780 --> 1:36:00.840
 That's that's what's interesting.

1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:07.120
 It's similar to, uh, Steven Wolfram has this idea of like the, if you just look at all

1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:13.040
 space of computations of all space of basically algorithms that you'd be surprised how many

1:36:13.040 --> 1:36:15.760
 of them are actually intelligent.

1:36:15.760 --> 1:36:19.600
 Like if you just randomly pick from the bucket, uh, that's surprising.

1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:26.400
 We tend to think like a tiny, tiny minority of them would be intelligent, but his sense

1:36:26.400 --> 1:36:32.760
 is like, it seems weirdly easy to find computations that do something interesting.

1:36:32.760 --> 1:36:38.680
 Well, okay, so that from like a calm agor, calm agor of complexity standpoint, almost

1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:40.080
 everything will be interesting.

1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:44.160
 What's fascinating is to find the stuff that's describable with low information, but still

1:36:44.160 --> 1:36:45.640
 does interesting things.

1:36:45.640 --> 1:36:51.080
 Uh, like one fun example of this, you know, um, Shannon's noisy coding and theorem, uh,

1:36:51.080 --> 1:36:55.400
 noisy coding theorem and, uh, information theory that basically says if, you know, I

1:36:55.400 --> 1:36:59.560
 want to send some bits to you, um, maybe, uh, some of them are going to get flipped.

1:36:59.560 --> 1:37:01.720
 Uh, there's some noise along the channel.

1:37:01.720 --> 1:37:04.320
 I can come up with some way of coding it.

1:37:04.320 --> 1:37:06.040
 That's resilient to that noise.

1:37:06.040 --> 1:37:07.280
 That's very good.

1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:10.400
 Um, and then he quantitatively describes what very good is.

1:37:10.400 --> 1:37:15.400
 What's funny about how he proves the existence of good error correction codes is rather than

1:37:15.400 --> 1:37:20.040
 saying like, here's how to construct it or even like a sensible nonconstructive proof.

1:37:20.040 --> 1:37:25.260
 The nature of his nonconstructive proof is to say, um, if we chose a random encoding,

1:37:25.260 --> 1:37:30.040
 it would be almost at the limit, which is weird because then it took decades for people

1:37:30.040 --> 1:37:33.000
 to actually find any that were anywhere close to the limit.

1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:35.880
 And what his proof was saying is choose a random one.

1:37:35.880 --> 1:37:39.160
 And it's like the best kind of encoding you'll ever find.

1:37:39.160 --> 1:37:44.600
 But what's what that tells us is that sometimes when you choose a random element from this

1:37:44.600 --> 1:37:49.120
 ungodly huge set, that's a very different task from finding an efficient way to actively

1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:50.120
 describe it.

1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:52.920
 Cause in that case, the random element to actually implement it as a bit of code, you

1:37:52.920 --> 1:37:58.200
 would just have this huge table of like, um, telling you how to encode one thing into another.

1:37:58.200 --> 1:38:00.520
 That's totally computationally infeasible.

1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:06.200
 So on the side of like how many possible programs are interesting in some way, it's like, yeah,

1:38:06.200 --> 1:38:07.200
 tons of them.

1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:11.920
 But the much, much more delicate question is when you can have a low information description

1:38:11.920 --> 1:38:14.720
 of something that still becomes interesting.

1:38:14.720 --> 1:38:18.400
 And thereby this kind of gives you a blueprint for how to engineer that kind of thing.

1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:19.400
 Right.

1:38:19.400 --> 1:38:20.400
 Yeah.

1:38:20.400 --> 1:38:22.800
 Chaos theory is another good instance there where it's like, yeah, a ton of things are

1:38:22.800 --> 1:38:27.040
 hard to describe, but how do you have ones that have a simple set of governing equations

1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:30.160
 that remain like arbitrarily hard to describe?

1:38:30.160 --> 1:38:33.680
 Well, let me ask you, uh, you mentioned GPT three.

1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:40.000
 It's interesting to ask, uh, what are your thoughts about the recently released open

1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:46.640
 AI GPT three model that I believe is already trying to learn how to communicate like Grant

1:38:46.640 --> 1:38:47.640
 Sanderson?

1:38:47.640 --> 1:38:51.480
 You know, I think I got an email a day or two ago about someone who wanted to, um, try

1:38:51.480 --> 1:38:57.280
 to use GPT three with manum where you would like give it a high level description of something

1:38:57.280 --> 1:39:01.120
 and then it'll like automatically create the mathematical animation, like trying to put

1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:03.120
 me out of a job here.

1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:08.920
 I mean, it probably won't put you out of a job, but it'll create something visually beautiful

1:39:08.920 --> 1:39:09.920
 for sure.

1:39:09.920 --> 1:39:15.040
 I would be surprised if that worked as stated, but maybe there's like variants of it like

1:39:15.040 --> 1:39:16.040
 that you can get to.

1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:18.600
 Um, I mean like a lot of those demos, it's interesting.

1:39:18.600 --> 1:39:26.360
 I think, uh, there's a lot of failed experiments, like depending on how you prime the thing,

1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:30.280
 you're going to have a lot of failed, I'm certainly with code and program synthesis.

1:39:30.280 --> 1:39:35.480
 Most of it won't even run, but eventually I think if you, if you're, if you pick the

1:39:35.480 --> 1:39:38.840
 right examples, you'll be able to generate something cool.

1:39:38.840 --> 1:39:42.280
 And I think that even that's good enough, even though if it's, if it's, if you're being

1:39:42.280 --> 1:39:46.240
 very selective, it's still cool that something can be generated.

1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:47.240
 Yeah.

1:39:47.240 --> 1:39:48.720
 That's a huge value.

1:39:48.720 --> 1:39:50.360
 Um, I mean, think of the writing process.

1:39:50.360 --> 1:39:52.960
 Sometimes a big part of it is just getting a bunch of stuff on the page and then you

1:39:52.960 --> 1:39:54.920
 can decide what to whittle down to.

1:39:54.920 --> 1:39:59.640
 So if it can be used in like a man machine symbiosis where it's just giving you a spew

1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:05.080
 of potential ideas that then you can refine down, um, like it's serving as the generator

1:40:05.080 --> 1:40:07.320
 and then the human serves as the refiner.

1:40:07.320 --> 1:40:09.280
 That seems like a pretty powerful dynamic.

1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:10.280
 Yeah.

1:40:10.280 --> 1:40:14.120
 Have you, uh, have you gotten a chance to see any of the demos like on Twitter?

1:40:14.120 --> 1:40:15.800
 Is there a favorite you've seen or?

1:40:15.800 --> 1:40:17.440
 Oh, my absolute favorite.

1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:18.440
 Yeah.

1:40:18.440 --> 1:40:23.000
 Uh, so Tim Blay who runs a channel called acapella science, he was like tweeting a bunch

1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:24.760
 about playing with it.

1:40:24.760 --> 1:40:30.680
 Um, and so he, so GPT three was trained on the internet from before COVID.

1:40:30.680 --> 1:40:33.660
 So in a sense it doesn't know about the Corona virus.

1:40:33.660 --> 1:40:37.800
 So what he seeded it with was just a short description about like, um, a novel virus,

1:40:37.800 --> 1:40:41.580
 uh, emerges in Wuhan, China and starts to spread around the globe.

1:40:41.580 --> 1:40:46.500
 What follows is a month by month description of what happens, January, colon, right?

1:40:46.500 --> 1:40:47.500
 That's what he sees it with.

1:40:47.500 --> 1:40:51.440
 So then what GPT three generates is like January, then a paragraph of description, February

1:40:51.440 --> 1:40:52.640
 and such.

1:40:52.640 --> 1:40:58.240
 And it's the funniest thing you'll ever read because, um, it predicts a zombie apocalypse,

1:40:58.240 --> 1:41:02.960
 which of course it would because it's trained on like the internet, the stories, but what

1:41:02.960 --> 1:41:08.240
 you see unfolding is a description of COVID 19 if it were a zombie apocalypse.

1:41:08.240 --> 1:41:12.680
 And like the early aspects of it are kind of shockingly in line with what's reasonable

1:41:12.680 --> 1:41:14.880
 and then it gets out of hand so quickly.

1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:19.600
 And the other flip side of that is, uh, I wouldn't be surprised if it's onto something

1:41:19.600 --> 1:41:25.360
 at some point here when, you know, 2020 has been full of surprises, who knows, like we

1:41:25.360 --> 1:41:30.880
 might all be in like this crazy militarized zone as it predicts just a couple of months

1:41:30.880 --> 1:41:31.880
 off.

1:41:31.880 --> 1:41:32.880
 Yeah.

1:41:32.880 --> 1:41:36.220
 I think there's definitely an interesting tool of storytelling.

1:41:36.220 --> 1:41:40.800
 It has struggled with mathematics, which is interesting, or in just even numbers, it's

1:41:40.800 --> 1:41:49.280
 able to, it's not able to generate like patterns, you know, like you give it, um, in like five

1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:55.560
 digit numbers and it's not able to figure out the sequence, you know, or like, um, I

1:41:55.560 --> 1:42:00.000
 didn't look in too much, but I'm talking about like sequences, like the Fibonacci numbers

1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:04.480
 and to see how far it can go because obviously it's leveraging stuff from the internet and

1:42:04.480 --> 1:42:09.400
 it starts to lose it, but it is also cool that I've seen it able to generate some interesting

1:42:09.400 --> 1:42:12.120
 patterns, um, that are mathematically correct.

1:42:12.120 --> 1:42:13.120
 Yeah.

1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:18.440
 I honestly haven't dug into like what's going on within it, uh, in a way that I can speak

1:42:18.440 --> 1:42:24.040
 intelligently to, I guess it doesn't surprise me that it's bad at numerical patterns because

1:42:24.040 --> 1:42:30.960
 I mean, maybe I should be more impressed with it, but like that requires having, um, a weird

1:42:30.960 --> 1:42:35.560
 combination of intuitive and, uh, and formulaic worldview.

1:42:35.560 --> 1:42:37.320
 So you're not just going off of intuition.

1:42:37.320 --> 1:42:39.940
 When you see Fibonacci numbers, you're not saying like intuitively, what do I think will

1:42:39.940 --> 1:42:40.940
 follow the 13?

1:42:40.940 --> 1:42:45.640
 Like I've seen patterns a lot where like 13s are followed by 21s instead.

1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:50.480
 It's the, like the way you're starting to see a shape of things is by knowing what hypotheses

1:42:50.480 --> 1:42:54.480
 to test where you're saying, oh, maybe it's generated based on the previous terms or maybe

1:42:54.480 --> 1:42:58.000
 it's generated based on like multiplying by a constant or whatever it is you like have

1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:01.760
 a bunch of different hypotheses and your intuitions are around those hypotheses, but you still

1:43:01.760 --> 1:43:04.240
 need to actively test it.

1:43:04.240 --> 1:43:10.100
 Um, and it seems like GPT three is extremely good at, um, like that sort of pattern matching

1:43:10.100 --> 1:43:13.360
 recognition that usually is very hard for computers.

1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:17.520
 That is what humans get good at through expertise and exposure to lots of things.

1:43:17.520 --> 1:43:21.920
 It's why it's good to learn from as many examples as you can rather than just from the definitions

1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:27.640
 it's to get that level of intuition, but to actually concretize it into a piece of math,

1:43:27.640 --> 1:43:33.600
 you do need to, um, like test your hypotheses and if not prove it, um, like have an actual

1:43:33.600 --> 1:43:37.800
 explanation for what's going on, not just a, uh, a pattern that you've seen.

1:43:37.800 --> 1:43:38.800
 Yeah.

1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:43.920
 And, but then the flip side to play devil's advocate, that's a very kind of probably correct

1:43:43.920 --> 1:43:49.400
 intuitive understanding of just like we said, a few, a few layers creating abstractions,

1:43:49.400 --> 1:43:58.080
 but it's been able to form something that looks like, uh, a compression of the data

1:43:58.080 --> 1:44:02.240
 that it's seen that looks awfully a lot like it understands what the heck it's talking

1:44:02.240 --> 1:44:03.240
 about.

1:44:03.240 --> 1:44:08.080
 Well, I think a lot of understanding is like, I don't mean to denigrate pattern recognition.

1:44:08.080 --> 1:44:12.320
 Pattern recognition is most of understanding and it's super important and it's super hard.

1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:16.640
 Um, and so like when it's demonstrating this kind of real understanding, compressing down

1:44:16.640 --> 1:44:20.720
 some data, like that, that might be pattern recognition at its finest.

1:44:20.720 --> 1:44:27.480
 My only point would be that like what differentiates math, I think to a large extent is that, um,

1:44:27.480 --> 1:44:32.040
 the pattern recognition isn't sufficient and that the kind of patterns that you're recognizing

1:44:32.040 --> 1:44:37.400
 are not like the end goals, but instead they're, they are the little bits and paths that get

1:44:37.400 --> 1:44:39.520
 you to the end goal.

1:44:39.520 --> 1:44:41.560
 That's certainly true for mathematics in general.

1:44:41.560 --> 1:44:47.240
 It's an interesting question if that might, uh, for certain kinds of series of numbers,

1:44:47.240 --> 1:44:48.360
 it might not be true.

1:44:48.360 --> 1:44:53.780
 Like you might, um, because that's a basic, you know, like Taylor's like certain kinds

1:44:53.780 --> 1:45:01.920
 of series, it feels like compressing the internet, uh, is, is enough to figure out because those

1:45:01.920 --> 1:45:05.360
 patterns in some form appear in the text somewhere.

1:45:05.360 --> 1:45:06.360
 Yeah.

1:45:06.360 --> 1:45:09.120
 Well, I mean, there's, uh, there's all sorts of wonderful examples of false patterns in

1:45:09.120 --> 1:45:13.320
 math where, um, one of the earliest videos I put on the channel was talking about the

1:45:13.320 --> 1:45:15.640
 extent of dividing a circle up using these chords.

1:45:15.640 --> 1:45:20.180
 And you see this pattern of one, two, four, eight, 16, I was like, okay, pretty easy to

1:45:20.180 --> 1:45:21.180
 see what that pattern is.

1:45:21.180 --> 1:45:22.180
 It's powers of two.

1:45:22.180 --> 1:45:23.680
 You've seen it a million times.

1:45:23.680 --> 1:45:25.800
 Um, but it's not powers of two.

1:45:25.800 --> 1:45:27.760
 The next term is 31.

1:45:27.760 --> 1:45:30.840
 And so it's like almost a power of two, but it's a little bit shy.

1:45:30.840 --> 1:45:33.640
 And there's, there's actually a very good explanation for what's going on.

1:45:33.640 --> 1:45:40.400
 Um, but I think it's a good test of whether you're thinking clearly about mechanistic

1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:44.520
 explanations of things, how quickly you jump to thinking it must be powers of two because

1:45:44.520 --> 1:45:49.560
 the problem itself, there's really no, no good way to, I mean, there can't be a good

1:45:49.560 --> 1:45:53.920
 way to think about it as like doubling a set because ultimately it doesn't, but even before

1:45:53.920 --> 1:45:58.520
 it starts to, it's not something that screams out as being a doubling phenomenon.

1:45:58.520 --> 1:46:03.000
 So at best, if it did turn out to be powers of two, it would have only been so very subtly.

1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:06.240
 And I think the difference between like, you know, a math student making the mistake and

1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:10.280
 a mathematician who's experienced seeing that kind of pattern is that they, they'll have

1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:15.440
 a sense from what the problem itself is, whether the pattern that they're observing is reasonable

1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:16.940
 and how to test it.

1:46:16.940 --> 1:46:23.440
 And like, uh, I w I would just be very impressed if there was any algorithm that, um, was actively

1:46:23.440 --> 1:46:24.920
 accomplishing that goal.

1:46:24.920 --> 1:46:25.920
 Yeah.

1:46:25.920 --> 1:46:26.920
 Like a learning base algorithm.

1:46:26.920 --> 1:46:27.920
 Yeah.

1:46:27.920 --> 1:46:29.920
 Like a little scientist, I guess.

1:46:29.920 --> 1:46:30.920
 Basically.

1:46:30.920 --> 1:46:31.920
 Yeah.

1:46:31.920 --> 1:46:36.840
 That's a fascinating thought because GPT three, these language models are already accomplishing

1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:38.600
 way more than I've expected.

1:46:38.600 --> 1:46:42.840
 So I'm learning not to doubt, but we'll get there.

1:46:42.840 --> 1:46:43.840
 Yeah.

1:46:43.840 --> 1:46:46.840
 I, I, I'm not saying I'd be impressed, but like surprised, like I'll be impressed, but

1:46:46.840 --> 1:46:52.680
 I think we'll get there on, um, algorithms doing math like that.

1:46:52.680 --> 1:47:00.520
 So one of the amazing things you've done for the world is to some degree, open sourcing

1:47:00.520 --> 1:47:08.000
 the tooling that you use to make your videos with Madam, uh, this Python library.

1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:11.480
 Now it's quickly evolving because I think you're inventing new things every time you

1:47:11.480 --> 1:47:12.480
 make a video.

1:47:12.480 --> 1:47:17.600
 In fact, I wanted, um, I've been working on playing around with something.

1:47:17.600 --> 1:47:20.160
 I wanted to do like an ode to three blue on Brown.

1:47:20.160 --> 1:47:22.200
 Like I love playing Hendrix.

1:47:22.200 --> 1:47:27.440
 I wanted to do like a cover, you know, of a concept I wanted to visualize and use Madam.

1:47:27.440 --> 1:47:31.920
 And I saw that you had like a little piece of code on like Mobia strip and I tried to

1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:39.240
 do some cool things with spinning a Mobia strip, like continue, um, twisting it, I guess

1:47:39.240 --> 1:47:44.640
 is the term, uh, and it was easier to, uh, it was tough.

1:47:44.640 --> 1:47:45.640
 So I haven't figured it out yet.

1:47:45.640 --> 1:47:50.760
 Well, so I guess the question I want to ask is so many people love it, uh, that you've

1:47:50.760 --> 1:47:51.760
 put that out there.

1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:54.920
 They want to, uh, do the same thing as I do with Hendrix and want to cover it.

1:47:54.920 --> 1:47:58.360
 They want to explain an idea using the tool, including Russ.

1:47:58.360 --> 1:48:02.420
 How would you recommend they try to, I'm very sorry.

1:48:02.420 --> 1:48:11.280
 They try to go, they try to go by, uh, about it and what kind of choices should they choose

1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:13.360
 to be most effective?

1:48:13.360 --> 1:48:14.360
 That I can answer.

1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:19.540
 So I always feel guilty if this comes up because, um, I think of it like this scrappy tool.

1:48:19.540 --> 1:48:22.320
 It's like a math teacher who put together some code.

1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:26.240
 People asked what it was, so they made it open source and they kept scrapping it together.

1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:29.400
 And there's a lot, like a lot of things about it that make it harder to work with than it

1:48:29.400 --> 1:48:33.040
 needs to be that are a function of like me not being a software engineer.

1:48:33.040 --> 1:48:39.160
 Um, I, I've, I've put some work this year trying to like make it better and more flexible.

1:48:39.160 --> 1:48:43.360
 Um, that is still just kind of like a work in process.

1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:48.280
 Um, one thing I would love to do is just get my act together about properly integrating

1:48:48.280 --> 1:48:53.420
 with what like the community wants to work with and like what stuff I work on and making

1:48:53.420 --> 1:48:58.520
 that, um, not like deviate, uh, and just like actually fostering that community in a way

1:48:58.520 --> 1:49:01.160
 that I've, I've been like shamefully neglectful of.

1:49:01.160 --> 1:49:03.220
 So I'm just always guilty if it comes up.

1:49:03.220 --> 1:49:08.080
 So let's put that guilt aside, just kind of Zen, like I'll pretend like it isn't terrible

1:49:08.080 --> 1:49:09.400
 for someone like Russ.

1:49:09.400 --> 1:49:14.240
 Um, I think step one is like, make sure that what you're animating should be done so programmatically

1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:16.320
 because a lot of things maybe shouldn't.

1:49:16.320 --> 1:49:20.960
 Um, like if you're just making a quick graph of something, uh, if it's a graphical intuition

1:49:20.960 --> 1:49:26.840
 that maybe has a little motion to it, use Desmos, use grapher, use GeoGebra, use Mathematica,

1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:28.640
 certain things that are like really oriented around graph.

1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:29.640
 GeoGebra is kind of cool.

1:49:29.640 --> 1:49:31.240
 I did super amazing.

1:49:31.240 --> 1:49:33.280
 You can get very, very far with it.

1:49:33.280 --> 1:49:37.680
 Um, and in a lot of ways, like it would make more sense for STEM stuff that I do to just

1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:42.080
 do in GeoGebra, but I kind of have this cycle of liking to try to improve man and by doing

1:49:42.080 --> 1:49:43.080
 videos and such.

1:49:43.080 --> 1:49:45.760
 So, uh, do as I say, not as I do.

1:49:45.760 --> 1:49:49.640
 The original like thought I had in making manum was that there's so many different ways

1:49:49.640 --> 1:49:55.000
 of representing functions other than graphs, um, in particular things like transformations,

1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:59.680
 like use movement over time to communicate relationships between inputs and outputs instead

1:49:59.680 --> 1:50:04.520
 of like estimate direction and Y direction, um, or like vector fields or things like that.

1:50:04.520 --> 1:50:08.280
 So I wanted something that was flexible enough that you didn't feel constrained into a graphical

1:50:08.280 --> 1:50:09.280
 environment.

1:50:09.280 --> 1:50:15.520
 Um, by graphical, I mean like graphs with like X coordinate, Y coordinate kind of stuff,

1:50:15.520 --> 1:50:20.720
 but also make sure that, um, you're taking advantage of the fact that it's programmatic.

1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:23.600
 You have loops, you have conditionals, you have abstraction.

1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:27.560
 If any of those are like well fit for what you want to teach to, you know, have a scene

1:50:27.560 --> 1:50:31.500
 type that you tweak a little bit based on parameters or to have conditional so that

1:50:31.500 --> 1:50:34.880
 things can go one way or another or loops so that you can create these things of like

1:50:34.880 --> 1:50:37.000
 arbitrarily increasing complexity.

1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.680
 That's the stuff that's like meant to be animated programmatically.

1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:43.720
 If it's just like writing some text on the screen or shifting around objects or something

1:50:43.720 --> 1:50:48.280
 like that, um, things like that, you should probably just use keynote, right?

1:50:48.280 --> 1:50:50.120
 Um, you'd be a lot simpler.

1:50:50.120 --> 1:50:55.100
 So, uh, try to find a workflow that distills down that which should be programmatic into

1:50:55.100 --> 1:50:58.280
 manum and that which doesn't need to be into like other domains.

1:50:58.280 --> 1:51:01.240
 Again, do as I say, not as I do.

1:51:01.240 --> 1:51:03.840
 I mean, Python is an integral part of it.

1:51:03.840 --> 1:51:09.480
 Just for the fun of it, let me ask, uh, what, uh, what's your most and least favorite aspects

1:51:09.480 --> 1:51:10.480
 of Python?

1:51:10.480 --> 1:51:12.600
 Ooh, most and least.

1:51:12.600 --> 1:51:18.040
 I mean, I love that it's like object oriented and functional, I guess that you can kind

1:51:18.040 --> 1:51:23.960
 of like get both of those, um, uh, benefits for how you structure things.

1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:26.760
 So if you would just want to quickly whip something together, the functional aspects

1:51:26.760 --> 1:51:27.760
 are nice.

1:51:27.760 --> 1:51:31.160
 It's your primary language, like for programmatically generating stuff.

1:51:31.160 --> 1:51:32.160
 Yeah.

1:51:32.160 --> 1:51:33.160
 It's home for me.

1:51:33.160 --> 1:51:34.160
 It's home.

1:51:34.160 --> 1:51:35.160
 Yeah.

1:51:35.160 --> 1:51:36.160
 Sometimes you travel, but it's home.

1:51:36.160 --> 1:51:37.160
 Got it.

1:51:37.160 --> 1:51:38.160
 It's home.

1:51:38.160 --> 1:51:39.360
 Uh, I mean, the biggest disadvantage is that it's slow.

1:51:39.360 --> 1:51:42.840
 So when you're doing computationally intensive things, either you have to like think about

1:51:42.840 --> 1:51:47.400
 it more than you should how to make it efficient or it just like takes long.

1:51:47.400 --> 1:51:48.720
 Do you run into that at all?

1:51:48.720 --> 1:51:49.720
 Like with your work?

1:51:49.720 --> 1:51:54.840
 Well, so, uh, certainly old man is like way slower than it needs to be because of, uh,

1:51:54.840 --> 1:51:58.640
 how it renders things on the backend is like kind of absurd.

1:51:58.640 --> 1:52:02.760
 I've rewritten things such that it's all done with like shaders in such a way that it should

1:52:02.760 --> 1:52:06.680
 be just like live and actually like interactive while you're coding it.

1:52:06.680 --> 1:52:12.200
 If you want to, to have like a 3d scene, you can move around, you can, um, have, um, elements

1:52:12.200 --> 1:52:14.240
 respond to where your mouse is or things.

1:52:14.240 --> 1:52:17.860
 That's not something that user of a video is going to get to experience cause there's

1:52:17.860 --> 1:52:19.360
 just a play button and a pause button.

1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:21.280
 But while you're developing, that can be nice.

1:52:21.280 --> 1:52:25.480
 Um, so it's gotten better in speed in that sense, but that's basically because the hard

1:52:25.480 --> 1:52:29.840
 work is being done in the language that's not Python, but GLSL, right?

1:52:29.840 --> 1:52:35.120
 Um, but yeah, there are some times when it's like a, um, there's just a lot of data that

1:52:35.120 --> 1:52:40.000
 goes into the object that I want to animate that then it just like Python is slow.

1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:44.640
 Well, let me ask, quickly ask, what do you think about the walrus operator, if you're

1:52:44.640 --> 1:52:46.040
 familiar with it at all?

1:52:46.040 --> 1:52:49.680
 The reason it's interesting, there's a new operator in Python 3.8.

1:52:49.680 --> 1:52:54.760
 I find it psychologically interesting cause it, the toxicity over it led Guido to resign

1:52:54.760 --> 1:52:55.760
 the step down from this.

1:52:55.760 --> 1:52:56.760
 Is that actually true?

1:52:56.760 --> 1:53:00.700
 Or was it like, there's a bunch of surrounding things that also, was it actually the walrus

1:53:00.700 --> 1:53:02.200
 operator that, that.

1:53:02.200 --> 1:53:08.320
 Well, it was, it was a text, it was an accumulation of toxicity, but that was the, the most, that

1:53:08.320 --> 1:53:11.640
 was the most toxic one, like the discussion.

1:53:11.640 --> 1:53:16.480
 That's the most number of Python core developers that were opposed to Guido's decision.

1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:20.500
 Um, he didn't particularly, I don't think cared about it either way.

1:53:20.500 --> 1:53:21.680
 He just thought it was a good idea.

1:53:21.680 --> 1:53:23.580
 This is where you approve it.

1:53:23.580 --> 1:53:30.000
 And like the structure of the idea of a BDFL is like you listen to everybody, hear everybody

1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:31.000
 out.

1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:33.400
 You make a decision and you move forward.

1:53:33.400 --> 1:53:37.600
 And he didn't like the negativity that burdened him after that.

1:53:37.600 --> 1:53:41.520
 People like some parts of the benevolent dictator for life mantra, but once the dictator does

1:53:41.520 --> 1:53:44.840
 things different than you want, suddenly dictatorship doesn't seem so great.

1:53:44.840 --> 1:53:45.840
 Yeah.

1:53:45.840 --> 1:53:46.840
 I mean, they still liked it.

1:53:46.840 --> 1:53:50.680
 He just couldn't because he truly is the bee in the benevolent.

1:53:50.680 --> 1:53:52.520
 He's really, he really is a nice guy.

1:53:52.520 --> 1:53:56.880
 He, I mean, and I think he can't, it's a lot of toxicity.

1:53:56.880 --> 1:53:57.880
 It's difficult.

1:53:57.880 --> 1:53:58.880
 It's a difficult job.

1:53:58.880 --> 1:54:01.480
 And that's why Linus Torvalds is perhaps the way he is.

1:54:01.480 --> 1:54:06.920
 You have to have a thick skin to fight off, fight off the warring masses.

1:54:06.920 --> 1:54:11.380
 It's kind of surprising to me how many people can like threatened to murder each other over

1:54:11.380 --> 1:54:15.360
 whether we should have braces or not, or like it's incredible.

1:54:15.360 --> 1:54:16.360
 Yeah.

1:54:16.360 --> 1:54:18.160
 I mean, that's my knee jerk reaction to the walrus operators.

1:54:18.160 --> 1:54:20.080
 Like I don't actually care that much either way.

1:54:20.080 --> 1:54:22.280
 I'm not going to get personally passionate.

1:54:22.280 --> 1:54:26.440
 My initial reaction was like, yeah, this seems to make things more confusing to read.

1:54:26.440 --> 1:54:29.300
 But then again, so does list comprehension until you're used to it.

1:54:29.300 --> 1:54:33.880
 So like if there's a use for it, great, if not great, but like, let's just all calm down

1:54:33.880 --> 1:54:37.840
 about our spaces versus tabs debates here and like, be chill.

1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:38.840
 Yeah.

1:54:38.840 --> 1:54:44.240
 To me, it just represents the value of great leadership, even in open source communities.

1:54:44.240 --> 1:54:46.640
 Does it represent that if he stepped down as a leader?

1:54:46.640 --> 1:54:48.120
 Well, he fought for it.

1:54:48.120 --> 1:54:49.600
 No, he got it passed.

1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:54.000
 I guess, but I guess, I could represent multiple things too.

1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:59.320
 It can represent like failed dictatorships or it can, it can represent a lot of things,

1:54:59.320 --> 1:55:03.120
 but to me, great leaders take risks.

1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:09.140
 Even if it, even if it's a mistake at the end, like you have to make decisions.

1:55:09.140 --> 1:55:11.760
 The thing is this world won't go anywhere.

1:55:11.760 --> 1:55:17.320
 If you constantly, if whenever there's a divisive thing, you wait until the division is no longer

1:55:17.320 --> 1:55:18.320
 there.

1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:22.560
 Like that's the paralysis we experienced with like Congress and political systems.

1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:28.800
 It's good to be slow when there's indecision, when there's people disagree, it's good to

1:55:28.800 --> 1:55:29.880
 take your time.

1:55:29.880 --> 1:55:34.020
 But like at a certain point it results in paralysis and you just have to make a decision.

1:55:34.020 --> 1:55:40.040
 The background of the site, whether it's yellow, blue, or red can cause people to like go to

1:55:40.040 --> 1:55:43.080
 war over each other, which I've seen this with design.

1:55:43.080 --> 1:55:49.520
 People are very touch on color, color choices at the end of the day, just make a decision

1:55:49.520 --> 1:55:50.520
 and go with it.

1:55:50.520 --> 1:55:55.400
 And that, that's what the Walrus operator represents to me is it represents the fighter

1:55:55.400 --> 1:56:01.720
 pilot instinct of like quick action is more important than, than just like hearing everybody

1:56:01.720 --> 1:56:05.600
 out and really think it through it because that's going to lead to paralysis.

1:56:05.600 --> 1:56:06.600
 Yeah.

1:56:06.600 --> 1:56:10.800
 Like if that's the actual case that, you know, it's something where he's consciously hearing

1:56:10.800 --> 1:56:16.280
 people's disagreement, disagreeing with that disagreement and saying he wants to move forward

1:56:16.280 --> 1:56:21.160
 anyway, that's an admirable aspect of leadership.

1:56:21.160 --> 1:56:26.520
 So we don't have much time, but I want to ask just cause it's some beautiful mathematics

1:56:26.520 --> 1:56:27.520
 involved.

1:56:27.520 --> 1:56:35.360
 2020 brought us a couple of in the physics world theories of everything, Eric Weinstein

1:56:35.360 --> 1:56:41.120
 kind of, I mean, it's been working for probably decades, but he put out this idea of geometric

1:56:41.120 --> 1:56:46.720
 unity or started sort of publicly thinking and talking about it more, Steven Wolfram

1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:53.560
 put out his physics project, which is kind of this hypergraph view of a theory of everything.

1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:58.920
 Do you find interesting, beautiful things to these theories of everything?

1:56:58.920 --> 1:57:04.520
 What do you think about the physics world and sort of the beautiful, interesting, insightful

1:57:04.520 --> 1:57:09.600
 mathematics in that world, whether we're talking about quantum mechanics, which you touched

1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:13.840
 on in a bunch of your videos a little bit, quaternions, like just the mathematics involved

1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:19.360
 or the general relativity, which is more about surfaces and topology, all that stuff.

1:57:19.360 --> 1:57:25.160
 Well, I think, um, as far as like popularized science is concerned, people are more interested

1:57:25.160 --> 1:57:29.640
 in theories of everything than they should be like, cause the problem is whether we're

1:57:29.640 --> 1:57:34.520
 talking about trying to make sense of Weinstein's lectures or Wolfram's project, or let's just

1:57:34.520 --> 1:57:40.000
 say like listening to, uh, Witten talk about string theory, whatever proposed path to a

1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:44.120
 theory of everything, um, you're not actually going to understand it.

1:57:44.120 --> 1:57:48.120
 Some physicists will, but like, you're just not actually going to understand the substance

1:57:48.120 --> 1:57:49.240
 of what they're saying.

1:57:49.240 --> 1:57:53.520
 What I think is way, way more productive is, um, to let yourself get really interested

1:57:53.520 --> 1:57:58.320
 in the phenomena that are still deep, but which you have a chance of understanding because

1:57:58.320 --> 1:58:02.300
 the path to getting to like even understanding what questions these theories of everything

1:58:02.300 --> 1:58:06.680
 are trying to answer involves like walking down that, um, I mean, I was watching a video

1:58:06.680 --> 1:58:11.480
 before I came here about from Steve mold talking about, um, why sugar polarizes light in a

1:58:11.480 --> 1:58:12.740
 certain way.

1:58:12.740 --> 1:58:15.400
 So fascinating, like really, really interesting.

1:58:15.400 --> 1:58:19.800
 It's not like this novel theory of everything type thing, but to understand what's going

1:58:19.800 --> 1:58:23.480
 on there really requires digging in in depth to certain ideas.

1:58:23.480 --> 1:58:27.440
 And if you let yourself think past what the video tells you about what does circularly

1:58:27.440 --> 1:58:31.160
 polarized light mean and things like that, it actually would get you to a pretty good

1:58:31.160 --> 1:58:36.280
 appreciation of like two state states and quantum systems, um, in a way that just trying

1:58:36.280 --> 1:58:40.920
 to read about like, Oh, what's the, um, what are the hard parts about resolving quantum

1:58:40.920 --> 1:58:44.400
 field theories with general relativity is never going to get you.

1:58:44.400 --> 1:58:50.340
 So as far as popularizing science is concerned, like the audience should be less interested

1:58:50.340 --> 1:58:52.720
 than they are in theories of everything.

1:58:52.720 --> 1:58:59.360
 Um, the popularizers should be less emphatic than they are about that for like actual practicing

1:58:59.360 --> 1:59:00.360
 physicists.

1:59:00.360 --> 1:59:01.360
 And that might be the case.

1:59:01.360 --> 1:59:06.040
 Maybe more people should think about fundamental questions, but it's difficult to create, uh,

1:59:06.040 --> 1:59:09.600
 like a three blue, one brown video on the theory of everything.

1:59:09.600 --> 1:59:16.040
 So basically we should really try to find the beauty in mathematics or physics by looking

1:59:16.040 --> 1:59:18.440
 at concepts that are like within reach.

1:59:18.440 --> 1:59:20.320
 Yeah, I think that's super important.

1:59:20.320 --> 1:59:25.360
 I mean, so you see this in math too with, um, the big unsolved problems.

1:59:25.360 --> 1:59:29.400
 So like the clay millennium problems, Riemann hypothesis, um, have you ever done a video

1:59:29.400 --> 1:59:30.400
 on Fermat's last theorem?

1:59:30.400 --> 1:59:31.720
 No, I have not yet.

1:59:31.720 --> 1:59:32.720
 No.

1:59:32.720 --> 1:59:34.120
 But if I did, do you know what I would do?

1:59:34.120 --> 1:59:38.720
 I would talk about, um, proving Fermat's last theorem in the specific case of N equals

1:59:38.720 --> 1:59:39.720
 three.

1:59:39.720 --> 1:59:40.720
 Okay.

1:59:40.720 --> 1:59:41.720
 Is that still accessible though?

1:59:41.720 --> 1:59:42.720
 Yes.

1:59:42.720 --> 1:59:43.720
 Actually barely.

1:59:43.720 --> 1:59:46.160
 Um, Mathologer might be able to do like a great job on this.

1:59:46.160 --> 1:59:50.480
 He does a good job of taking stuff that's barely accessible and making it, but the,

1:59:50.480 --> 1:59:55.280
 the core ideas of proving it for N equals three are hard, but they do get you real ideas

1:59:55.280 --> 1:59:56.960
 about algebraic number theory.

1:59:56.960 --> 2:00:00.760
 And it involves looking at a number field that's, uh, it lives in the complex plane.

2:00:00.760 --> 2:00:04.680
 It looks like a hexagonal lattice and you start asking questions about factoring numbers

2:00:04.680 --> 2:00:06.540
 in this hexagonal lattice.

2:00:06.540 --> 2:00:10.280
 So it takes a while, but I've talked about this sort of like lattice arithmetic, um,

2:00:10.280 --> 2:00:15.680
 in other contexts and you can get to a okay understanding of that.

2:00:15.680 --> 2:00:18.720
 And the things that make Fermat's last theorem hard are actually quite deep.

2:00:18.720 --> 2:00:23.040
 Um, and so the cases that we can solve it for, it's like you can get these broad sweeps

2:00:23.040 --> 2:00:28.800
 based on some hard, but like accessible, um, bits of number theory.

2:00:28.800 --> 2:00:32.280
 But before you can even understand why the general case is as hard as it is, you have

2:00:32.280 --> 2:00:33.960
 to walk through those.

2:00:33.960 --> 2:00:38.040
 And so any other attempt to describe it would just end up being like shallow and not really

2:00:38.040 --> 2:00:39.840
 productive for the viewer's time.

2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:45.900
 Um, I think the same goes for, uh, most like unsolved problem type things where I think,

2:00:45.900 --> 2:00:49.860
 you know, as a kid, I was actually very inspired by the twin prime conjecture, um, that like

2:00:49.860 --> 2:00:52.400
 totally sucked me in as this thing that was understandable.

2:00:52.400 --> 2:00:55.960
 I kind of had this dream like, Oh, maybe I'll be the one to prove the twin prime conjecture

2:00:55.960 --> 2:01:00.000
 and new math that I would learn would be like viewed through this lens of like, Oh, maybe

2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:01.920
 I can apply it to that in some way.

2:01:01.920 --> 2:01:08.280
 But, uh, you sort of mature to a point where you realize that, uh, you should spend your

2:01:08.280 --> 2:01:12.920
 brain cycles on problems that you will see resolved because then you're going to grow

2:01:12.920 --> 2:01:16.420
 to see what it feels like for these things to be resolved rather than spending your brain

2:01:16.420 --> 2:01:19.920
 cycles on something where it's not, it's not going to pan out.

2:01:19.920 --> 2:01:24.280
 Um, and the people who do make progress towards these things like James Maynard, uh, is a

2:01:24.280 --> 2:01:28.960
 great example here of like young creative mathematician who like pushes in the direction

2:01:28.960 --> 2:01:33.040
 of things like the twin prime conjecture rather than hitting that head on, just see all the

2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:36.520
 interesting questions that are hard for similar reasons, but become more tractable and let

2:01:36.520 --> 2:01:38.480
 themselves really engage with those.

2:01:38.480 --> 2:01:41.280
 Um, so I think people should get in that habit.

2:01:41.280 --> 2:01:46.160
 I think the popularization of physics should encourage that habit through things like the

2:01:46.160 --> 2:01:50.000
 physics of simple everyday phenomena, because it can get quite deep.

2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:54.680
 And um, yeah, I think I, you know, I've, I've heard a lot of the interest that, you know,

2:01:54.680 --> 2:01:58.880
 people send me messages asking to explain Weinstein's thing or asking to explain Wolfram's

2:01:58.880 --> 2:01:59.880
 thing.

2:01:59.880 --> 2:02:06.400
 One, I don't understand them, but more importantly, um, it's too big a bite to, you shouldn't

2:02:06.400 --> 2:02:08.960
 be interested in those, right?

2:02:08.960 --> 2:02:12.480
 The giant sort of a ball of interesting ideas.

2:02:12.480 --> 2:02:16.600
 There's probably a million of interesting ideas in there that individually could be

2:02:16.600 --> 2:02:17.600
 explored effectively.

2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:20.080
 And to be clear, you should be interested in fundamental questions.

2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:25.160
 I think that's a good habit to ask what the fundamentals of things are, but I think it

2:02:25.160 --> 2:02:29.480
 takes a lot of steps to like, certainly you shouldn't be trying to answer that unless

2:02:29.480 --> 2:02:33.520
 you actually understand quantum field theory and you actually understand general relativity.

2:02:33.520 --> 2:02:37.200
 That's the cool thing about like your videos, people who haven't done mathematics, like

2:02:37.200 --> 2:02:42.560
 if you really give it time, watch it a couple of times and like try to try to reason about

2:02:42.560 --> 2:02:45.400
 it, you can actually understand the concept that's being explained.

2:02:45.400 --> 2:02:49.980
 And it's not a coincidence that the things I'm describing aren't like the most, um, up

2:02:49.980 --> 2:02:55.720
 to date, uh, progress on the Riemann hypothesis cousins or, um, like there's context in which

2:02:55.720 --> 2:03:00.200
 the analog of the Riemann hypothesis has been solved in like more, uh, discrete feeling

2:03:00.200 --> 2:03:02.360
 finite settings that are more well behaved.

2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:05.840
 I'm not describing that because it just takes a ton to get there.

2:03:05.840 --> 2:03:10.800
 And instead I think it'll be like productive to have an actual understanding of something

2:03:10.800 --> 2:03:12.940
 that can, you can pack into 20 minutes.

2:03:12.940 --> 2:03:15.160
 I think that's beautifully put ultimately.

2:03:15.160 --> 2:03:20.320
 That's where like the most satisfying thing is when you really understand, um, yeah, really

2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:25.080
 understand, build a habit of feeling what it's like to actually come to resolution.

2:03:25.080 --> 2:03:26.080
 Yeah.

2:03:26.080 --> 2:03:27.080
 Yeah.

2:03:27.080 --> 2:03:32.120
 As opposed to, which it can also be enjoyable, but just being in awe of the fact that you

2:03:32.120 --> 2:03:33.120
 don't understand anything.

2:03:33.120 --> 2:03:34.120
 Yeah.

2:03:34.120 --> 2:03:35.120
 That's not like, I don't know.

2:03:35.120 --> 2:03:40.440
 Maybe we'll get entertainment out of that, but it's not as fulfilling as understanding

2:03:40.440 --> 2:03:41.920
 you won't grow.

2:03:41.920 --> 2:03:42.920
 Yeah.

2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:47.560
 And, but also just the fulfilling, it really does feel good when you first don't understand

2:03:47.560 --> 2:03:51.040
 something and then you do, that's a beautiful feeling.

2:03:51.040 --> 2:03:57.080
 Hey, let me ask you one, uh, last, last time we got awkward and weird about, uh, a fear

2:03:57.080 --> 2:04:01.600
 of mortality, which you made fun of me off, but let me ask you on the, the other absurd

2:04:01.600 --> 2:04:08.000
 question is, um, what do you think is, uh, the meaning of our life of meaning of life?

2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:11.160
 I'm sorry if I made fun of you about, no, you didn't.

2:04:11.160 --> 2:04:12.160
 I'm just joking.

2:04:12.160 --> 2:04:13.160
 It was great.

2:04:13.160 --> 2:04:15.300
 I don't think life has a meaning.

2:04:15.300 --> 2:04:18.560
 I think like meaning, I don't understand the question.

2:04:18.560 --> 2:04:22.600
 I think meaning is something that's described to stuff that's created with purpose.

2:04:22.600 --> 2:04:26.440
 There's a meaning to, uh, like this water bottle label and that someone created it with

2:04:26.440 --> 2:04:27.960
 a purpose of conveying meaning.

2:04:27.960 --> 2:04:31.560
 And there was like one consciousness that wanted to get its ideas into another consciousness.

2:04:31.560 --> 2:04:35.640
 Um, most things don't have that property.

2:04:35.640 --> 2:04:41.160
 It's a little bit like if I asked you, um, like what is the height, all right, so it's

2:04:41.160 --> 2:04:42.160
 all relative.

2:04:42.160 --> 2:04:43.160
 Yeah.

2:04:43.160 --> 2:04:44.840
 You'd be like the height of what you can't ask.

2:04:44.840 --> 2:04:46.600
 What is the height without an object?

2:04:46.600 --> 2:04:50.880
 You can't ask what is the meaning of life without like an intentful consciousness, putting

2:04:50.880 --> 2:04:56.400
 it like, I guess I'm revealing I'm not very religious, but you know, the mathematics of

2:04:56.400 --> 2:04:58.800
 everything seems kind of beautiful.

2:04:58.800 --> 2:05:05.280
 It seems like, it seems like there's some kind of structure relative to which, I mean,

2:05:05.280 --> 2:05:06.880
 you could calculate the height.

2:05:06.880 --> 2:05:09.840
 Well, so, but what I'm saying is I don't understand the question.

2:05:09.840 --> 2:05:10.840
 What is the meaning of life in that?

2:05:10.840 --> 2:05:13.680
 I think people might be asking something very real.

2:05:13.680 --> 2:05:14.680
 I don't understand what they're asking.

2:05:14.680 --> 2:05:16.800
 Are they asking like, why does life exist?

2:05:16.800 --> 2:05:17.840
 Like how did it come about?

2:05:17.840 --> 2:05:19.320
 What are the natural laws?

2:05:19.320 --> 2:05:23.600
 Are they asking, um, as I'm making decisions day by day for what should I do?

2:05:23.600 --> 2:05:26.240
 What is the guiding light that inspires like, what should I do?

2:05:26.240 --> 2:05:27.960
 I think that's what people are kind of asking.

2:05:27.960 --> 2:05:36.160
 But also like why the thing that gives you joy about education, about mathematics, what

2:05:36.160 --> 2:05:37.680
 the hell is that?

2:05:37.680 --> 2:05:41.840
 Like what interactions with other people, interactions with like minded people, I think

2:05:41.840 --> 2:05:46.860
 is the meaning of, in that sense, bringing others joy, essentially, like in something

2:05:46.860 --> 2:05:53.560
 you've created, it connects with others somehow and the same and the vice versa.

2:05:53.560 --> 2:05:57.460
 I think that that is what, um, when we use the word meaning to mean like you're sort

2:05:57.460 --> 2:06:01.600
 of filled with a sense of happiness and energy to create more things, like I have so much

2:06:01.600 --> 2:06:06.640
 meaning taken from this, like that, yeah, that's what fuels, fuels my pump at least.

2:06:06.640 --> 2:06:10.480
 So a life alone on a desert island would be kind of meaningless.

2:06:10.480 --> 2:06:11.480
 Yeah.

2:06:11.480 --> 2:06:13.960
 You want to be alone together with someone.

2:06:13.960 --> 2:06:15.680
 I think we're all alone together.

2:06:15.680 --> 2:06:18.600
 I think there's no better way to end it, Grant.

2:06:18.600 --> 2:06:22.200
 You've been, first time we talked, it was amazing again, it's a huge honor that you

2:06:22.200 --> 2:06:23.200
 make time for me.

2:06:23.200 --> 2:06:24.200
 I appreciate talking with you.

2:06:24.200 --> 2:06:25.200
 Thanks, man.

2:06:25.200 --> 2:06:26.200
 Awesome.

2:06:26.200 --> 2:06:27.200
 Thanks for listening.

2:06:27.200 --> 2:06:29.640

2:06:50.800 --> 2:06:54.240
 And now let me leave you with some words from Richard Feynman.

2:06:54.240 --> 2:06:59.440
 I have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very

2:06:59.440 --> 2:07:00.440
 well.

2:07:00.440 --> 2:07:04.960
 He'll hold up a flower and say, look how beautiful it is, and I'll agree.

2:07:04.960 --> 2:07:10.800
 Then he says, I as an artist can see how beautiful this is, but you as a scientist take this

2:07:10.800 --> 2:07:13.960
 all apart and it becomes a dull thing.

2:07:13.960 --> 2:07:16.240
 And I think he's kind of nutty.

2:07:16.240 --> 2:07:21.560
 First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe.

2:07:21.560 --> 2:07:26.960
 Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is, I can appreciate the beauty of a

2:07:26.960 --> 2:07:27.960
 flower.

2:07:27.960 --> 2:07:31.160
 At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees.

2:07:31.160 --> 2:07:37.040
 I can imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty.

2:07:37.040 --> 2:07:40.900
 I mean, it's not just beauty at this dimension at one centimeter, there's also beauty at

2:07:40.900 --> 2:07:46.280
 smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes.

2:07:46.280 --> 2:07:50.480
 The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it

2:07:50.480 --> 2:07:52.040
 is interesting.

2:07:52.040 --> 2:07:54.880
 It means that insects can see the color.

2:07:54.880 --> 2:07:56.240
 It adds a question.

2:07:56.240 --> 2:07:59.760
 Does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms?

2:07:59.760 --> 2:08:01.320
 Why is it aesthetic?

2:08:01.320 --> 2:08:05.920
 All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement,

2:08:05.920 --> 2:08:08.700
 the mystery and the awe of a flower.

2:08:08.700 --> 2:08:09.700
 It only adds.

2:08:09.700 --> 2:08:13.280
 I don't understand how it subtracts.

2:08:13.280 --> 2:08:25.240
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
