00:00.000 --> 00:02.440
 The following is a conversation with Jamie Metzl,

00:02.440 --> 00:05.900
 author specializing in topics of genetic engineering,

00:05.900 --> 00:09.200
 biotechnology, and geopolitics.

00:09.200 --> 00:12.160
 In the past two years, he has been outspoken

00:12.160 --> 00:15.240
 about the need to investigate and keep an open mind

00:15.240 --> 00:18.200
 about the origins of COVID 19.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.940
 In particular, he has been keeping an extensive

00:20.940 --> 00:23.520
 up to date collection of circumstantial evidence

00:23.520 --> 00:25.760
 in support of what is colloquially known

00:25.760 --> 00:30.580
 as lab leak hypothesis that COVID 19 leaked in 2019

00:30.580 --> 00:33.580
 from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

00:33.580 --> 00:35.560
 In part, I wanted to explore the idea

00:35.560 --> 00:37.920
 in response to the thoughtful criticism

00:37.920 --> 00:40.760
 to parts of the Francis Collins episode.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.780
 I will have more and more difficult conversations like this

00:43.780 --> 00:45.840
 with people from all walks of life

00:45.840 --> 00:47.800
 and with all kinds of ideas.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.200
 I promise to do my best to keep an open mind

00:50.200 --> 00:52.300
 and yet to ask hard questions

00:52.300 --> 00:54.240
 while together searching for the beautiful

00:54.240 --> 00:57.620
 and the inspiring in the mind of the other person.

00:57.620 --> 00:59.920
 It's a hard line to walk gracefully,

00:59.920 --> 01:01.640
 especially for someone like me,

01:01.640 --> 01:03.520
 who's a bit of an awkward introvert

01:03.520 --> 01:06.480
 with barely the grasp of the English language

01:06.480 --> 01:10.200
 or any language, except maybe Python and C++.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.920
 But I hope you stick around, be patient and empathetic

01:13.920 --> 01:17.300
 and maybe learn something new together with me.

01:17.300 --> 01:19.500
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.640
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:21.640 --> 01:22.840
 in the description.

01:22.840 --> 01:26.600
 And now, here's my conversation with Jamie Metzl.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.560
 What is the probability in your mind

01:29.560 --> 01:32.080
 that COVID 19 leaked from a lab?

01:32.080 --> 01:35.960
 In your write up, I believe you said 85%.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.720
 I know it's just a percentage.

01:37.720 --> 01:39.840
 We can't really be exact with these kinds of things,

01:39.840 --> 01:42.360
 but it gives us a sense where your mind is,

01:42.360 --> 01:43.320
 where your intuition is.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.960
 So as it stands today, what would you say is that probability?

01:46.960 --> 01:48.960
 I would stand by what I've been saying

01:48.960 --> 01:51.940
 since really the middle of last year.

01:51.940 --> 01:55.600
 It's more likely and not, in my opinion,

01:55.600 --> 01:56.880
 that the pandemic stems

01:56.880 --> 01:59.400
 from an accidental lab incident in Wuhan.

01:59.400 --> 02:04.200
 Is it 90%, is it 65%, I mean, that's kind of arbitrary.

02:04.200 --> 02:08.120
 But when I stack up all of the available evidence

02:08.120 --> 02:11.000
 and all of it on both sides is circumstantial,

02:11.000 --> 02:14.400
 it weighs very significantly toward a lab incident origin.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.920
 So before we dive into the specifics at a high level,

02:17.920 --> 02:22.120
 what types of evidence, what intuition, what ideas

02:22.120 --> 02:25.800
 are leading you to have that kind of estimate?

02:25.800 --> 02:28.000
 Is it possible to kind of condense,

02:28.000 --> 02:32.160
 when you look at the wall of evidence before you,

02:32.160 --> 02:36.600
 where's your source, the strongest source of your intuition?

02:36.600 --> 02:39.200
 And I would have to say it's just logic

02:39.200 --> 02:40.600
 and deductive reasoning.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.440
 So before I make the case for why I think

02:42.440 --> 02:44.960
 it's most likely a lab incident origin,

02:44.960 --> 02:46.700
 let's just say why it could be,

02:46.700 --> 02:49.400
 and still could be a natural origin.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.840
 All of this is a natural origin in the sense

02:51.840 --> 02:56.840
 that it's a bat virus backbone, horseshoe bat virus backbone.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.340
 Okay, I'm gonna keep pausing you to define stuff.

03:00.340 --> 03:04.080
 So maybe it's useful to say, what do we mean by lab leak?

03:04.080 --> 03:05.880
 What do we mean by natural origin?

03:05.880 --> 03:07.760
 What do we mean by virus backbone?

03:07.760 --> 03:09.760
 Okay, great questions.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.400
 So viruses come from somewhere.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.880
 Viruses have been around for 3.5 billion years,

03:14.880 --> 03:17.800
 and they've been around for such a long time

03:17.800 --> 03:20.680
 because they are adaptive and they're growing

03:20.680 --> 03:23.600
 and they're always changing and they're morphing.

03:23.600 --> 03:26.280
 And that's why viruses are,

03:26.280 --> 03:29.480
 I mean, they've been very successful and we are our victims.

03:29.480 --> 03:30.660
 Sometimes we're beneficiaries.

03:30.660 --> 03:34.760
 We have viral DNA has morphed into our genomes,

03:34.760 --> 03:37.680
 but now it's certainly in the case of COVID 19,

03:37.680 --> 03:42.680
 we are victims of the success of viruses.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.760
 And so when we talk about a backbone,

03:44.760 --> 03:49.760
 so the SARS CoV2 virus, it has a history

03:50.040 --> 03:52.640
 and these viruses don't come out of whole cloth.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.640
 There are viruses that morph.

03:54.640 --> 03:59.080
 And so we know that at some period,

03:59.080 --> 04:02.000
 maybe 20 years ago or whatever,

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
 the virus that is SARS CoV2 existed in horseshoe bats.

04:08.580 --> 04:13.120
 It was a horseshoe bat virus and it evolved somewhere.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.640
 And there are some people who say,

04:15.640 --> 04:16.920
 there's no evidence of this,

04:16.920 --> 04:18.760
 but it's a plausible theory

04:18.760 --> 04:21.040
 based on how things have happened in the past.

04:21.040 --> 04:25.060
 Maybe that virus jumped from the horseshoe bat

04:25.060 --> 04:27.120
 through some intermediate species.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.040
 So it's like, let's say there's a bat

04:29.040 --> 04:31.780
 and that it infects some other animal.

04:31.780 --> 04:36.200
 Let's say it's a pig or a raccoon dog or a civet cat.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.120
 They're all pangolin.

04:37.120 --> 04:40.280
 They're all sorts of animals that have been considered.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.880
 And then that virus adapts into that new host

04:43.880 --> 04:45.960
 and it changes and grows.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.120
 And then according to the quote unquote

04:48.120 --> 04:49.520
 natural origins hypothesis,

04:49.520 --> 04:53.140
 it jumps from that animal into humans.

04:53.140 --> 04:55.120
 And so what you could imagine

04:55.120 --> 04:57.000
 and some of the people who are making the case,

04:57.000 --> 04:57.880
 all of the people actually,

04:57.880 --> 05:00.960
 who are making the case for a natural origin of the virus,

05:00.960 --> 05:03.440
 what they're saying is it went from bat

05:03.440 --> 05:05.760
 to some intermediate species.

05:05.760 --> 05:08.420
 And then from that intermediate species, most likely,

05:08.420 --> 05:10.920
 there's some people who say it went directly bat to human,

05:10.920 --> 05:13.040
 but through some intermediate species.

05:13.040 --> 05:16.600
 And then humans interacted with that species.

05:16.600 --> 05:20.000
 And then it jumped from that, whatever it is to humans.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.740
 And that's a very plausible theory.

05:21.740 --> 05:23.320
 It's just that there's no evidence for it.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.720
 And the nature of the interaction is,

05:25.720 --> 05:29.680
 do most people kind of suggest this at the wet markets?

05:29.680 --> 05:32.540
 So the interaction of the humans with the animal

05:32.540 --> 05:35.300
 is in the form of it's either a live animal

05:35.300 --> 05:39.640
 as being sold to be eaten or a recently live animal,

05:39.640 --> 05:41.920
 but newly dead animal being sold to be eaten.

05:41.920 --> 05:46.100
 That's certainly one very possible possibility,

05:46.100 --> 05:48.900
 a possible possibility, I don't know if that's a word.

05:48.900 --> 05:52.000
 But the people who believe in the wet market origin,

05:52.000 --> 05:52.940
 that's what they're saying.

05:52.940 --> 05:55.400
 So they had one of these animals,

05:55.400 --> 05:57.880
 they were cutting it up, let's say, in a market

05:57.880 --> 06:01.000
 and maybe some of the blood got into somebody's,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.140
 maybe had a cut on their hand or maybe it was aerosolized

06:04.140 --> 06:05.960
 and so somebody breathed it.

06:05.960 --> 06:09.080
 And then that virus found this new host

06:09.080 --> 06:11.600
 and that was the human host.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.920
 But you could also have that happen in, let's say, a farm.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.880
 So it's happened in the past that let's say

06:17.880 --> 06:21.360
 that there are farms and because of human encroachment

06:21.360 --> 06:24.920
 into wild spaces, we're pushing our farms

06:24.920 --> 06:27.380
 and our animal farms further and further

06:27.380 --> 06:30.880
 into what used to be just natural habitats.

06:30.880 --> 06:33.000
 And so it's happened in the past, for example,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.880
 that there were bats roosting over pig pens

06:35.880 --> 06:38.920
 and the bat droppings went into the pig pens.

06:38.920 --> 06:43.320
 The viruses in those droppings infected the pigs

06:43.320 --> 06:45.960
 and then the pigs infected the humans.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.520
 And that's why it's a plausible theory.

06:48.520 --> 06:51.980
 It's just that there's basically no evidence for it.

06:51.980 --> 06:56.660
 If it was the case that SARS CoV2 comes from this type

06:56.660 --> 07:00.740
 of interaction, as in most of the at least recent

07:00.740 --> 07:03.160
 past outbreaks, we'd see evidence of that.

07:03.160 --> 07:05.200
 Viruses are messy.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.960
 They're constantly undergoing Darwinian evolution

07:07.960 --> 07:10.340
 and they're changing and it's not that they're just ready

07:10.340 --> 07:13.800
 for prime time, ready to infect humans on day one.

07:13.800 --> 07:18.400
 Normally you can trace the viral evolution prior

07:18.400 --> 07:20.640
 to the time when it infects humans.

07:20.640 --> 07:24.720
 But for SARS CoV2, it just showed up on the scene

07:24.720 --> 07:26.740
 ready to infect humans.

07:26.740 --> 07:30.600
 And there's no history that anybody has found so far

07:30.600 --> 07:33.040
 of that kind of viral evolution.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.600
 With the first SARS, you could track it

07:35.600 --> 07:39.920
 by the genome sequencing that it was experimenting.

07:39.920 --> 07:44.320
 And SARS CoV2 was very, very stable,

07:44.320 --> 07:47.540
 meaning it had already adapted to humans

07:47.540 --> 07:49.760
 by the time it interacted with us.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.720
 It's fully adapted.

07:50.720 --> 07:55.140
 So with SARS, there's a rapid evolution

07:55.140 --> 07:58.520
 when it first kind of hooks onto a human.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.680
 Yeah, because it's trying.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.440
 Like a virus, its goal is to survive and replicate.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.280
 Yeah, no, it's true.

08:03.280 --> 08:04.400
 It's like, oh, we're gonna try this.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.240
 Oh, that didn't work.

08:05.240 --> 08:08.240
 We'll try it exactly like a startup.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.400
 And so we don't see that.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.960
 And so there are some people who say,

08:11.960 --> 08:16.400
 well, one hypothesis is you have a totally isolated

08:16.400 --> 08:18.880
 group of humans, maybe in Southern China,

08:18.880 --> 08:22.860
 which is more than a thousand miles away from Wuhan.

08:22.860 --> 08:26.840
 And maybe they're doing their animal farming

08:26.840 --> 08:31.840
 right next to these areas where there are these horseshoe bats.

08:31.920 --> 08:34.600
 And maybe in this totally isolated place

08:34.600 --> 08:35.600
 that no one's ever heard of,

08:35.600 --> 08:37.860
 they're not connected to any other place,

08:37.860 --> 08:39.740
 one person gets infected.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.400
 And it doesn't spread to anybody else

08:42.400 --> 08:44.080
 because they're so isolated.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.720
 They're like, I don't know.

08:45.720 --> 08:48.120
 I can't even imagine that this is the case.

08:48.120 --> 08:52.560
 Then somebody gets in a car and drives all night,

08:52.560 --> 08:55.400
 more than a thousand miles through crappy roads

08:55.400 --> 08:57.560
 to get to Wuhan, doesn't stop for anything,

08:57.560 --> 08:59.120
 doesn't infect anybody on the way.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.880
 No one else in that person's village infects anyone.

09:01.880 --> 09:03.560
 And then that person goes straight

09:03.560 --> 09:05.720
 to the Huanan seafood market,

09:05.720 --> 09:09.280
 according to this, in my mind, not very credible theory,

09:09.280 --> 09:12.640
 and then unloads his stuff and everybody gets infected.

09:12.640 --> 09:15.240
 And they're only delivering those animals

09:15.240 --> 09:18.800
 to the Wuhan market, which doesn't even sell very many

09:18.800 --> 09:20.240
 of these kinds of animals

09:20.240 --> 09:23.120
 that are likely intermediate species and not anywhere else.

09:23.120 --> 09:25.900
 So that's, I mean, it's a little bit of a straw man,

09:26.880 --> 09:29.200
 but on top of that, the Chinese have sequenced

09:29.200 --> 09:32.420
 more than 80,000 animal samples,

09:32.420 --> 09:36.280
 and there's no evidence of this type of viral evolution

09:36.280 --> 09:37.400
 that we would otherwise expect.

09:37.400 --> 09:42.400
 Let's try to, at this moment, steel man the argument

09:43.920 --> 09:46.400
 for the natural origin of the virus.

09:46.400 --> 09:50.240
 So just to clarify, so Wuhan is actually,

09:50.240 --> 09:52.200
 despite what it might sound like to people,

09:52.200 --> 09:53.920
 is a pretty big city.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.140
 There's a lot of people that live in it.

09:55.140 --> 09:55.980
 11 million.

09:55.980 --> 09:59.640
 So not only is there, at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

09:59.640 --> 10:03.960
 there's other centers that do work on viruses,

10:03.960 --> 10:06.600
 but there's also a giant number of markets.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.000
 And everything we're talking about here

10:08.000 --> 10:09.560
 is pretty close together.

10:09.560 --> 10:13.640
 So when I kind of look at the geography of this,

10:13.640 --> 10:16.000
 I think when you zoom out, it's all Wuhan,

10:16.000 --> 10:17.280
 but when you zoom in,

10:17.280 --> 10:19.240
 there's just a lot of interesting dynamics

10:19.240 --> 10:21.600
 that could be happening and what the cases are popping up

10:21.600 --> 10:24.040
 and what's being reported, all that kind of stuff.

10:24.040 --> 10:29.040
 So I think the people that argue for the natural origin,

10:29.560 --> 10:31.560
 and there's a few recent papers

10:31.560 --> 10:32.960
 that come out arguing this,

10:33.880 --> 10:35.640
 it's kind of fascinating to watch this whole thing,

10:35.640 --> 10:36.920
 but I think what they're arguing

10:36.920 --> 10:39.060
 is that there's this Hunan market

10:39.060 --> 10:44.060
 that's one of the major markets, the wet markets in Wuhan,

10:45.420 --> 10:49.160
 that there's a bunch of cases

10:49.160 --> 10:51.680
 that were reported from there.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.200
 So if I look at, for example,

10:54.200 --> 10:58.980
 the Michael Warby perspective that he wrote in Science,

10:58.980 --> 11:01.940
 he argues, he wrote this a few days ago,

11:01.940 --> 11:06.600
 the predominance of early COVID cases linked to Hunan market,

11:06.600 --> 11:09.800
 and this can't be dismissed as ascertainment bias,

11:09.800 --> 11:11.120
 which I think is what people argue,

11:11.120 --> 11:13.340
 that you're just kind of focusing on this region

11:13.340 --> 11:14.400
 because a lot of cases came,

11:14.400 --> 11:18.280
 but there could be a huge number of other cases.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.760
 So people who argue against this

11:19.760 --> 11:22.660
 say that this is a later stage already.

11:24.880 --> 11:29.760
 So he says no, he says this is the epicenter,

11:29.760 --> 11:34.760
 and this is a clear evidence, circumstantial evidence,

11:36.500 --> 11:37.920
 but evidence nevertheless

11:37.920 --> 11:42.320
 that this is where the jump happened to humans,

11:42.320 --> 11:44.720
 the big explosion, maybe not case zero,

11:44.720 --> 11:47.400
 I don't know if he argues that, but the early cases.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.160
 So what do you make of this whole idea?

11:49.160 --> 11:52.480
 Can you steel man it before we talk about the alternative?

11:52.480 --> 11:56.160
 And my goal here isn't to attack people on the other side,

11:56.160 --> 12:00.760
 and my feeling is if there is evidence that's presented

12:00.760 --> 12:02.840
 that should change my view,

12:02.840 --> 12:06.520
 I hope that I'll be open minded enough to change my view.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.400
 And certainly Michael Warby is a thoughtful person,

12:09.400 --> 12:11.200
 a respected scientist,

12:11.200 --> 12:14.080
 and I think this work is contributive work,

12:14.080 --> 12:19.080
 but I just don't think that it's as significant

12:19.720 --> 12:22.640
 as has been reported in the press.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.880
 And so what his argument is,

12:24.880 --> 12:29.880
 is that there is an early cluster in December of 2019

12:30.420 --> 12:33.360
 around the Huanan seafood market.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.400
 And even though he himself argues

12:36.400 --> 12:39.560
 that the original breakthrough case,

12:39.560 --> 12:41.520
 the original case, the index case

12:41.520 --> 12:46.160
 where the first person infected happened earlier,

12:46.160 --> 12:49.800
 happened in October or November, so not in December.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.880
 His argument is, well, what are the odds

12:52.880 --> 12:56.480
 that you would have this number, this cluster of cases

12:56.480 --> 12:58.080
 in the Huanan seafood market,

12:58.080 --> 13:00.940
 and if the origin happened someplace else,

13:00.940 --> 13:03.280
 wouldn't you expect other clusters?

13:03.280 --> 13:06.160
 And it's not an entirely implausible argument,

13:06.160 --> 13:08.040
 but there are reasons why I think

13:08.040 --> 13:11.400
 that this is not nearly as determinative

13:11.400 --> 13:12.800
 as has been reported.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.240
 And I certainly had a lot of,

13:14.240 --> 13:17.640
 I and others had tweeted a lot about this.

13:17.640 --> 13:21.600
 And that is first, the people who were infected

13:21.600 --> 13:26.520
 in this cluster, it's not the earliest known virus

13:26.520 --> 13:28.560
 of the SARS CoV2, it began mutating.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.840
 So this is, it's not the original SARS CoV2 there.

13:31.840 --> 13:34.640
 So it had to have happened someplace else.

13:34.640 --> 13:38.560
 Two, the people who were infected in the market

13:38.560 --> 13:41.520
 weren't infected in the part of the market

13:41.520 --> 13:43.700
 where they had these kinds of animals

13:43.700 --> 13:46.240
 that are considered to be candidates

13:46.240 --> 13:49.440
 as an intermediary species.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.760
 And third, there was a bias,

13:51.760 --> 13:53.160
 and actually I'll have four things.

13:53.160 --> 13:58.160
 Third, there was a bias in the early assessment in China

13:58.200 --> 13:59.720
 of what they were looking for.

13:59.720 --> 14:02.320
 They were asked, did you have exposure to the market?

14:02.320 --> 14:03.360
 Because I think in the early days

14:03.360 --> 14:05.120
 when people were figuring things out,

14:05.120 --> 14:08.720
 that was one of the questions that was asked.

14:08.720 --> 14:11.480
 And fourth, and probably most significantly,

14:11.480 --> 14:14.440
 we have so little information

14:14.440 --> 14:16.920
 about those early cases in China,

14:16.920 --> 14:18.520
 and that's really unfortunate.

14:18.520 --> 14:19.760
 I know we'll talk about this later

14:19.760 --> 14:23.000
 because the Chinese government is preventing access

14:23.000 --> 14:26.080
 to all of that information, which they have,

14:26.080 --> 14:28.880
 which could easily help us get to the bottom,

14:28.880 --> 14:31.840
 at least know a ton more about how this pandemic started.

14:31.840 --> 14:36.840
 And so this is, it's like grasping at straws

14:36.960 --> 14:38.440
 in the dark with gloves on.

14:38.440 --> 14:39.660
 That's right.

14:39.660 --> 14:41.720
 But to steel man the argument,

14:41.720 --> 14:45.040
 we have this evidence from this market,

14:45.040 --> 14:47.000
 and yes, the Chinese government

14:47.000 --> 14:48.960
 has turned off the lights essentially,

14:48.960 --> 14:51.320
 so we have very little data to work with,

14:51.320 --> 14:53.440
 but this is the data we have.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.560
 So who's to say that this data

14:55.560 --> 14:58.880
 doesn't represent a much bigger data set

14:58.880 --> 15:01.560
 that a lot of people got infected at this market

15:01.560 --> 15:04.960
 where even at the parts, or especially at the parts

15:04.960 --> 15:09.160
 where the infected meat was being sold?

15:09.160 --> 15:13.640
 So that could be true, and it probably is true.

15:13.640 --> 15:16.840
 The question is, is this the source?

15:16.840 --> 15:18.740
 Is this the place where this began?

15:18.740 --> 15:22.000
 Or was this just a place where it was amplified?

15:22.000 --> 15:26.640
 And I certainly think that it's extremely likely

15:26.640 --> 15:31.240
 that the Huanan seafood market was a point of amplification.

15:31.240 --> 15:33.000
 And it's just answering a different question.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.320
 Basically what you're saying is it's very difficult

15:35.320 --> 15:38.200
 to use the market as evidence for anything

15:38.200 --> 15:42.720
 because it's probably not even the starting point.

15:42.720 --> 15:45.800
 So it's just a good place for it to continue spreading.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.560
 That's certainly my view.

15:47.560 --> 15:51.840
 What Michael Warby's argument is, Marco, is that,

15:51.840 --> 15:53.140
 well, what are the odds of that?

15:53.140 --> 15:57.000
 That we're seeing this amplification in the market.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.240
 And if we, let me put it this way.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.520
 If we had all of the information,

16:02.520 --> 16:06.000
 if the Chinese government hadn't blocked access

16:06.000 --> 16:08.480
 to all of this, because there's blood bank information,

16:08.480 --> 16:10.600
 there's all sorts of information,

16:10.600 --> 16:14.980
 and based on a full and complete understanding,

16:14.980 --> 16:18.360
 we came to believe that all of the early cases

16:18.360 --> 16:19.500
 were at this market.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.280
 I think that would be a stronger argument

16:22.280 --> 16:23.980
 than what this is so far.

16:23.980 --> 16:26.720
 But everything leads to the fact that why is it

16:26.720 --> 16:28.640
 that the Chinese government,

16:28.640 --> 16:31.240
 which was, frankly, after a slow start,

16:31.240 --> 16:36.240
 the gold standard of doing viral tracking for SARS 1,

16:36.720 --> 16:39.840
 why have they apparently done so little

16:39.840 --> 16:41.140
 and shared so little?

16:41.140 --> 16:45.040
 I think it asks, it begs a lot of questions.

16:45.040 --> 16:48.920
 Okay, so let's then talk about the Chinese government.

16:50.220 --> 16:51.960
 There's several governments, right?

16:51.960 --> 16:54.340
 So one is the local government of Wuhan.

16:55.560 --> 16:56.720
 And not just the Chinese government.

16:56.720 --> 16:59.040
 Let's talk about government.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.820
 No, let's talk about human nature.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.480
 Let's just keep zooming out.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.920
 Let's talk about planet Earth.

17:04.920 --> 17:08.440
 No, so there's the Wuhan local government.

17:08.440 --> 17:12.540
 There's the Chinese government led by Xi Jinping.

17:13.840 --> 17:16.480
 And there's governments in general.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.080
 I'm trying to empathize.

17:18.080 --> 17:21.440
 So my father was involved with Chernobyl.

17:21.440 --> 17:25.680
 I'm trying to put myself into the mind of local officials,

17:25.680 --> 17:27.120
 of people who are like,

17:27.120 --> 17:32.120
 oh shit, there's a potential catastrophic event

17:32.280 --> 17:36.320
 happening here and it's my ass

17:36.320 --> 17:39.600
 because there's incompetence all over the place.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.600
 Yeah, human nature is such that there's incompetence

17:41.600 --> 17:44.600
 all over the place and you're always trying to cover it up.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.120
 And so given that context,

17:48.320 --> 17:52.720
 I want to lay out all the possible incompetence,

17:52.720 --> 17:54.980
 all the possible malevolence,

17:54.980 --> 17:58.600
 all the possible geopolitical tensions here.

18:01.280 --> 18:06.280
 All right, where in your sense did the coverup start?

18:06.400 --> 18:10.840
 So there's this suspicious fact,

18:13.280 --> 18:16.720
 it seems like that the Wuhan Institute of Virology

18:16.720 --> 18:19.200
 had a public database of thousands

18:19.200 --> 18:22.640
 of sampled bad coronavirus sequences

18:22.640 --> 18:26.320
 and that went offline in September of 2019.

18:26.320 --> 18:28.220
 What's that about?

18:28.220 --> 18:30.560
 So let me talk about that specific

18:30.560 --> 18:33.600
 and then I'll also follow your path of zooming out

18:33.600 --> 18:34.560
 and it's a really important.

18:34.560 --> 18:35.400
 Is that a good starting point?

18:35.400 --> 18:37.080
 It's a great starting point, yeah, yeah.

18:37.080 --> 18:40.440
 So but there's a bigger story

18:40.440 --> 18:42.560
 but let me talk about that.

18:42.560 --> 18:45.280
 So the Wuhan Institute of Virology

18:46.500 --> 18:48.080
 and we can go into the whole history

18:48.080 --> 18:50.360
 of the Wuhan Institute of Virology either now or later

18:50.360 --> 18:52.220
 because I think it's very relevant to the story

18:52.220 --> 18:55.440
 but let's focus for now on this database.

18:55.440 --> 19:00.400
 They had a database of 22,000 viral samples

19:00.400 --> 19:02.840
 and sequence information about viruses

19:02.840 --> 19:05.080
 that they had collected.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.660
 Some of which, the collection of some of which

19:07.660 --> 19:10.400
 was supported through funding from the NIH,

19:10.400 --> 19:12.800
 not a huge NIH through the EcoHealth Alliance.

19:12.800 --> 19:17.800
 It's a relatively small amount, $600,000 but not nothing.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.880
 The goal of this database

19:20.880 --> 19:24.400
 was so that we could understand viral evolution

19:24.400 --> 19:27.360
 so that exactly for this kind of moment

19:27.360 --> 19:29.680
 where we had an unknown virus,

19:29.680 --> 19:31.960
 we could say, well, is this like anything

19:31.960 --> 19:33.440
 that we've seen before?

19:33.440 --> 19:35.880
 And that would help us both understand what we're facing

19:35.880 --> 19:39.420
 and be better able to respond.

19:39.420 --> 19:44.420
 So this was a password protected public access database.

19:45.060 --> 19:50.060
 In 2019, in September 2019,

19:50.060 --> 19:52.620
 it became inaccessible and then the whole,

19:52.620 --> 19:55.900
 a few months later, the entire database disappeared.

19:55.900 --> 20:00.060
 What the Chinese have said is that because there were

20:00.060 --> 20:03.060
 all kinds of computer attacks on this database

20:03.060 --> 20:07.060
 but why would that happen in September 2019

20:07.060 --> 20:11.500
 before the pandemic, at least as far as we know.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.580
 So just to clarify.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.460
 Yes.

20:14.460 --> 20:17.460
 It went down to September 2019

20:17.460 --> 20:19.700
 just so we get the year straight.

20:19.700 --> 20:22.140
 January 2020 is when the virus

20:22.140 --> 20:25.980
 really started getting the press.

20:25.980 --> 20:29.020
 So we're talking about December 2019,

20:29.020 --> 20:30.980
 a lot of early infections happened.

20:30.980 --> 20:34.900
 September 2019 is when this database goes down.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.260
 Just to clarify because you said it quickly,

20:37.260 --> 20:39.580
 the Chinese government said

20:39.580 --> 20:44.000
 that their database was getting hacked.

20:44.900 --> 20:48.660
 Therefore, Xu Zhengli, the director of this part

20:48.660 --> 20:50.820
 of the Wuhan Institute of Virology said that.

20:50.820 --> 20:53.260
 Oh really, she was the one that said it?

20:53.260 --> 20:54.100
 She was the one who said it.

20:54.100 --> 20:56.420
 Oh boy, I did not even know that part.

20:56.420 --> 20:57.240
 Yeah.

20:57.240 --> 20:58.620
 Well, she's an interesting character.

20:58.620 --> 20:59.460
 We'll talk about her.

20:59.460 --> 21:00.300
 Yeah.

21:00.300 --> 21:05.300
 So the excuse is that it's getting cyber attacked a lot

21:07.700 --> 21:10.820
 so we're gonna take it down without any further explanation

21:10.820 --> 21:12.140
 which seems very suspicious.

21:12.140 --> 21:15.620
 And then this virus starts to emerge

21:15.620 --> 21:17.500
 in October, November, December.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.500
 There's a lot of argument about that, but after.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.420
 Sorry to interrupt, but some people are saying

21:21.420 --> 21:23.220
 that the first outbreak could have happened

21:23.220 --> 21:25.140
 as early as September.

21:25.140 --> 21:27.640
 I think it's more likely it's October, November,

21:27.640 --> 21:31.340
 but for the people who are saying that the first outbreak,

21:31.340 --> 21:34.940
 the first incident of a known outbreak,

21:34.940 --> 21:37.360
 at least to somebody, happened in September,

21:37.360 --> 21:40.440
 they make the argument, well, what if that also happened

21:40.440 --> 21:42.460
 in mid September of 2019?

21:42.460 --> 21:43.800
 I'm not prepared to go there,

21:43.800 --> 21:45.100
 but there are some people who make that argument.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.980
 But I think, again, if I were to put myself

21:47.980 --> 21:50.060
 in the mind of officials,

21:50.060 --> 21:53.740
 whether it's officials within the Wuhan Institute of Virology

21:53.740 --> 21:55.860
 or Wuhan local officials,

21:58.020 --> 22:02.020
 I think if I notice some major problem,

22:02.020 --> 22:03.540
 like somebody got sick,

22:04.460 --> 22:09.220
 some sign of, oh shit, we screwed up,

22:09.220 --> 22:11.940
 that's when you kind of do the slow,

22:11.940 --> 22:13.740
 there's like a Homer Simpson meme

22:13.740 --> 22:15.580
 where you slowly start backing out,

22:15.580 --> 22:20.580
 and I would probably start hiding stuff.

22:20.740 --> 22:21.860
 CYA, yeah.

22:21.860 --> 22:25.980
 Yeah, and then coming up with really shady excuses.

22:25.980 --> 22:27.900
 It's like you're in a relationship

22:27.900 --> 22:30.020
 and your girlfriend wants to see your phone,

22:30.020 --> 22:31.400
 and you're like, I'm sorry,

22:31.400 --> 22:33.540
 I'm just getting attacked by the Russians now.

22:33.540 --> 22:35.340
 The cyber security issue, I can't.

22:35.340 --> 22:36.820
 Yeah, I wish I could.

22:36.820 --> 22:39.780
 I wish I could, it's just unsafe right now.

22:39.780 --> 22:42.820
 So would it be okay if I give you my kind of macro view

22:42.820 --> 22:44.620
 of the whole information space

22:44.620 --> 22:48.300
 and why I believe this has been so contentious?

22:50.660 --> 22:52.460
 If I had to give my best guess,

22:52.460 --> 22:56.020
 and I underline the word guess of what happened,

22:56.020 --> 22:59.540
 and your background, your family background with Chernobyl

22:59.540 --> 23:02.100
 I think is highly relevant here.

23:02.100 --> 23:06.340
 So after the first SARS, there was a recognition

23:06.340 --> 23:09.860
 that we needed to distribute knowledge about virology

23:09.860 --> 23:11.660
 and epidemiology around the world,

23:11.660 --> 23:14.900
 that people in China and Africa and Southeast Asia,

23:14.900 --> 23:16.700
 they were the frontline workers,

23:16.700 --> 23:20.620
 and they needed to be doing a lot of the viral monitoring

23:20.620 --> 23:24.760
 and assessment so that we could have an early alarm system.

23:25.660 --> 23:28.260
 And that was why there was a lot of investment

23:28.260 --> 23:30.980
 in all of those places in building capacity

23:30.980 --> 23:31.980
 and training people

23:31.980 --> 23:34.620
 and helping to build institutional capacity.

23:34.620 --> 23:36.780
 And the Chinese government,

23:36.780 --> 23:40.540
 they recognized that they needed to ramp things up.

23:40.540 --> 23:43.300
 And then the World Health Organization

23:43.300 --> 23:44.660
 and the World Health Assembly,

23:44.660 --> 23:47.620
 they had their international health regulations

23:47.620 --> 23:50.140
 that were designed to create a stronger infrastructure.

23:50.140 --> 23:52.540
 So that was the goal.

23:52.540 --> 23:54.320
 There were a lot of investments,

23:54.320 --> 23:55.420
 and I know we'll talk later

23:55.420 --> 23:56.940
 about the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

23:56.940 --> 23:59.420
 and I won't go into that right now.

23:59.420 --> 24:02.620
 So there was all of this distributed capacity.

24:02.620 --> 24:07.300
 And so in the early days, there's a breakout in Wuhan.

24:07.300 --> 24:10.740
 We don't know, is it September, October, November?

24:10.740 --> 24:14.640
 Maybe December is when the local authorities

24:14.640 --> 24:16.700
 start to recognize that something's happening.

24:16.700 --> 24:19.260
 But at some point in late 2019,

24:19.260 --> 24:23.580
 local officials in Wuhan understand that something is up.

24:23.580 --> 24:26.060
 And exactly like in Chernobyl,

24:26.060 --> 24:29.220
 these guys exist within a hierarchical system,

24:29.220 --> 24:32.340
 and they are going to be rewarded if good things happen,

24:32.340 --> 24:34.000
 and they're going to be in big trouble

24:34.000 --> 24:36.280
 if bad things happen under their watch.

24:36.280 --> 24:39.580
 So their initial instinct is to squash it.

24:39.580 --> 24:42.200
 And my guess is they think,

24:42.200 --> 24:44.340
 well, if we squash this information,

24:44.340 --> 24:47.180
 we can most likely beat back this outbreak,

24:47.180 --> 24:49.380
 because lots of outbreaks happen all the time,

24:49.380 --> 24:51.500
 including of SARS 1,

24:51.500 --> 24:53.980
 where there was multiple lab incidents

24:53.980 --> 24:56.860
 out of a lab in Beijing.

24:56.860 --> 24:59.820
 And so they start their coverup on day one.

24:59.820 --> 25:02.620
 They start screening social media.

25:02.620 --> 25:06.180
 They send nasty letters to different doctors

25:06.180 --> 25:08.660
 and others who are starting to speak up.

25:08.660 --> 25:12.120
 But then it becomes clear that there's a bigger issue.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.820
 And then the national government of China,

25:14.820 --> 25:17.500
 again, this is just a hypothesis,

25:17.500 --> 25:19.700
 the national government gets involved.

25:19.700 --> 25:21.920
 They say, all right, this is getting much bigger.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.100
 They go in and they realize

25:24.100 --> 25:26.200
 that we have a big problem on our hands.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.340
 They relatively quickly know

25:28.340 --> 25:30.680
 that it's spreading human to human.

25:30.680 --> 25:32.900
 And so the right thing for them to do then

25:32.900 --> 25:35.380
 is what the South African government is doing now

25:35.380 --> 25:37.860
 is to say, we have this outbreak.

25:37.860 --> 25:40.820
 We don't know everything, but we know it's serious.

25:40.820 --> 25:41.680
 We need help.

25:41.680 --> 25:44.780
 But that's not the instinct of people in most governments

25:44.780 --> 25:48.340
 and certainly not in authoritarian governments like China.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.980
 And so the national government,

25:50.980 --> 25:52.820
 they have a choice at that point.

25:52.820 --> 25:55.060
 They can do option one,

25:55.060 --> 25:57.540
 which is what we would hear called the right thing,

25:57.540 --> 25:59.620
 which is total transparency.

25:59.620 --> 26:03.460
 They criticize the local officials for having this coverup.

26:03.460 --> 26:05.860
 And they say, now we're going to be totally transparent.

26:05.860 --> 26:07.980
 But what does that do in a system

26:07.980 --> 26:10.740
 like the former Soviet Union, like China now?

26:10.740 --> 26:12.460
 If local officials say, wait a second,

26:12.460 --> 26:15.940
 I thought my job was to cover everything up,

26:15.940 --> 26:18.340
 to support this alternative reality

26:18.340 --> 26:22.280
 that authoritarian systems need in order to survive.

26:22.280 --> 26:23.860
 Well, now I'm gonna be held accountable

26:23.860 --> 26:26.740
 for if I'm not totally transparent,

26:26.740 --> 26:29.420
 like your whole system would collapse.

26:29.420 --> 26:32.580
 So the national government, they have that choice

26:32.580 --> 26:37.260
 and their only choice according to the logic of their system

26:37.260 --> 26:39.020
 is to be all in on a coverup.

26:39.020 --> 26:41.620
 And that's why they block the World Health Organization

26:41.620 --> 26:45.520
 from sending its team to Wuhan for over three weeks.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.580
 They overtly lie to the World Health Organization

26:48.580 --> 26:51.280
 about human to human transmission.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.580
 And then they begin their coverups.

26:53.580 --> 26:56.900
 So they begin very, very quickly destroying samples,

26:56.900 --> 26:59.860
 hiding records, they start imprisoning people

26:59.860 --> 27:02.900
 for asking basic questions.

27:02.900 --> 27:05.780
 Soon after they establish a gag order,

27:05.780 --> 27:08.060
 preventing Chinese scientists from writing

27:08.060 --> 27:10.600
 or saying anything about pandemic origins

27:10.600 --> 27:12.200
 without prior government approval.

27:12.200 --> 27:16.180
 And what that does means that there isn't a lot of data,

27:16.180 --> 27:19.300
 there's not nearly enough data coming out of China.

27:19.300 --> 27:22.860
 And so lots of responsible scientists outside of China

27:22.860 --> 27:25.040
 who are data driven say, well,

27:25.040 --> 27:29.300
 I don't have enough information to draw conclusions.

27:29.300 --> 27:34.300
 And then into that vacuum step a relatively small number

27:35.180 --> 27:39.220
 of largely virologists, but also others,

27:39.220 --> 27:40.820
 respected scientists.

27:40.820 --> 27:43.220
 And I know we'll talk about the, I think,

27:43.220 --> 27:47.060
 infamous Peter Daszak who say,

27:47.060 --> 27:52.060
 well, without any real foundation in the evidence,

27:52.780 --> 27:56.780
 they say, we know pretty much this comes from nature

27:56.780 --> 28:00.300
 and anyone who's raising the possibility

28:00.300 --> 28:03.420
 of a lab incident origin is a conspiracy theorist.

28:03.420 --> 28:07.940
 So that message starts to percolate.

28:07.940 --> 28:11.620
 And then in the United States, we have Donald Trump

28:11.620 --> 28:15.440
 and he's starting to get criticized for America's failure

28:15.440 --> 28:17.680
 to respond, prepare for and respond adequately

28:17.680 --> 28:19.060
 to the outbreak.

28:19.060 --> 28:22.900
 And so he starts saying, well, I know first

28:22.900 --> 28:25.160
 after praising Xi Jinping, he starts saying,

28:25.160 --> 28:28.620
 well, I know that China did it and the WHO did it

28:28.620 --> 28:33.020
 and he's kind of pointing fingers at everybody but himself.

28:33.020 --> 28:36.140
 And then we have a media here that had shifted

28:36.140 --> 28:40.760
 from the traditional model of he said, she said journalism,

28:40.760 --> 28:43.220
 so and so said X and so and so said Y

28:43.220 --> 28:45.860
 and then we'll present both of those views.

28:45.860 --> 28:47.460
 With Donald Trump,

28:47.460 --> 28:50.600
 he would make outlandish starting positions.

28:50.600 --> 28:53.460
 So he would say, Lex is an ax murderer.

28:53.460 --> 28:55.380
 And then in the early days, they would say,

28:55.380 --> 28:59.180
 Lex is an ax murderer, Lex's friend says

28:59.180 --> 29:01.340
 he's not an ax murderer and we have a four day debate,

29:01.340 --> 29:02.580
 is he or isn't he?

29:02.580 --> 29:04.660
 And then at day four, someone would say,

29:04.660 --> 29:06.820
 why are we having this debate at all?

29:06.820 --> 29:11.780
 Because the original point is just is baseless.

29:11.780 --> 29:13.860
 And so the media just got in the habit,

29:13.860 --> 29:16.660
 here's what Trump said and here's why it's wrong.

29:16.660 --> 29:20.020
 It's very complicated to figure out

29:20.020 --> 29:21.620
 what is the role of a politician?

29:21.620 --> 29:23.900
 What is the role of a leader in this kind of game

29:23.900 --> 29:25.580
 of politics?

29:25.580 --> 29:29.620
 But certainly in when there's a tragedy,

29:29.620 --> 29:32.060
 when there's a catastrophic event,

29:32.060 --> 29:35.300
 what it takes to be a leader is to see clearly

29:35.300 --> 29:38.760
 through the fog and to make big bold decisions

29:38.760 --> 29:41.180
 that does speak to the truth of things.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.140
 And even if it's unpopular truth,

29:44.300 --> 29:48.100
 to listen to the people, to listen to all sides,

29:48.100 --> 29:51.780
 to the opinions, to the controversial ideas

29:51.780 --> 29:54.660
 and to see past all the bullshit,

29:54.660 --> 29:59.220
 all the political bullshit and just speak to the people,

29:59.220 --> 30:02.700
 speak to the world and make bold, big decisions.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.860
 That's probably what was needed in terms of leadership.

30:04.860 --> 30:09.140
 And I'm not so willing to criticize whether it's Joe Biden

30:09.140 --> 30:11.300
 or Donald Trump on this.

30:11.300 --> 30:15.780
 I think most people cannot be great leaders,

30:15.780 --> 30:18.620
 but that's why when great leaders step up,

30:18.620 --> 30:20.260
 we write books about them.

30:20.260 --> 30:21.220
 And I agree.

30:21.220 --> 30:24.740
 And even though, I mean, I think of myself

30:24.740 --> 30:27.940
 as a progressive person, I certainly was a critic

30:27.940 --> 30:32.940
 of a lot of what President Trump did.

30:33.420 --> 30:36.160
 But on this particular case,

30:36.160 --> 30:39.420
 even though he may have said it in an uncouth way,

30:39.420 --> 30:43.620
 Donald Trump was actually, in my view, right.

30:43.620 --> 30:46.660
 I mean, when he said, hey, let's look at this lab.

30:46.660 --> 30:48.640
 I mean, he said, I have evidence, I can't tell you.

30:48.640 --> 30:51.300
 I don't think he even had the evidence.

30:51.300 --> 30:55.440
 But his intuition that this probably comes from a lab,

30:55.440 --> 30:58.140
 in my view was a correct intuition.

30:58.140 --> 31:00.000
 And certainly I started speaking up

31:00.000 --> 31:04.420
 about pandemic origins early in 2019.

31:04.420 --> 31:08.740
 And my friends, my democratic friends were brutal with me

31:08.740 --> 31:09.740
 saying, what are you doing?

31:09.740 --> 31:11.780
 You're supporting Trump in an election year.

31:11.780 --> 31:15.460
 And I said, just because Donald Trump is saying something

31:15.460 --> 31:17.980
 doesn't mean that I need to oppose it.

31:17.980 --> 31:21.820
 If Donald Trump says something that I think is correct,

31:21.820 --> 31:22.940
 well, I wanna say it's correct,

31:22.940 --> 31:25.260
 just as if he says something that I don't like,

31:25.260 --> 31:26.880
 I'm gonna speak up about that.

31:26.880 --> 31:28.540
 Good, you walked through the fire.

31:28.540 --> 31:31.920
 So that's, you laid out the story here.

31:31.920 --> 31:36.520
 And I think in many ways it's a human story.

31:36.520 --> 31:40.380
 It's a story of politics, it's a story of human nature.

31:40.380 --> 31:45.380
 But let's talk about the story of the virus.

31:45.740 --> 31:48.340
 And let's talk about the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

31:48.340 --> 31:51.940
 So maybe this is a good time to try to talk about

31:51.940 --> 31:53.540
 its history, about its origins,

31:53.540 --> 31:55.920
 about what kind of stuff it works on,

31:55.920 --> 32:00.780
 about biosafety levels, and about Batwoman.

32:00.780 --> 32:02.820
 Yeah, Xu Zhengli, yes.

32:02.820 --> 32:03.780
 Xu Zhengli.

32:03.780 --> 32:06.540
 So what is the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

32:06.540 --> 32:07.540
 when did it start?

32:07.540 --> 32:09.060
 Yeah, so it's a great question.

32:09.060 --> 32:14.060
 So after SARS 1, which was in the early 2000, 2003, 2004,

32:15.820 --> 32:20.100
 there was this effort to enhance,

32:20.100 --> 32:23.820
 as I mentioned before, global capacity, including in China.

32:23.820 --> 32:25.520
 So the Wuhan Institute of Virology

32:25.520 --> 32:29.220
 had been around for decades before then.

32:29.220 --> 32:32.100
 But there was an agreement between the French

32:32.100 --> 32:37.100
 and the Chinese governments to build the largest BSL4 lab,

32:37.100 --> 32:39.940
 BSL4 lab, so biosafety level four.

32:39.940 --> 32:42.380
 So in these what are called high containment labs,

32:42.380 --> 32:44.500
 there's level four, which is the highest level.

32:44.500 --> 32:47.340
 And people have seen that on TV and elsewhere,

32:47.340 --> 32:50.780
 where you have the people in the different suits

32:50.780 --> 32:51.900
 and all of these protections.

32:51.900 --> 32:55.520
 And then there's level three, which is still very serious,

32:56.900 --> 32:58.820
 but not as much as level four.

32:58.820 --> 33:03.220
 And then level two is just kind of goggles and some gloves

33:03.220 --> 33:05.700
 and maybe a face mask, much less.

33:05.700 --> 33:10.300
 So the French and the Chinese governments agreed

33:10.300 --> 33:13.500
 that France would help build the first

33:13.500 --> 33:18.500
 and still the largest BSL4 plus some mobile BSL3 labs.

33:20.140 --> 33:22.220
 And they were going to do it in Wuhan.

33:22.220 --> 33:24.980
 And Wuhan is kind of like China's Chicago.

33:24.980 --> 33:26.740
 And I had actually been, it's a different story.

33:26.740 --> 33:30.660
 I'd been in Wuhan relatively not that long

33:30.660 --> 33:32.920
 before the pandemic broke out.

33:32.920 --> 33:34.900
 And that was why I knew that Wuhan,

33:34.900 --> 33:37.380
 it's not some backwater where there are a bunch of yokels

33:37.380 --> 33:40.260
 eating bats for dinner every night.

33:40.260 --> 33:44.260
 This is a really sophisticated, wealthy, highly educated

33:44.260 --> 33:45.840
 and cultured city.

33:45.840 --> 33:48.420
 And so I knew that it wasn't like

33:48.420 --> 33:50.340
 that even the one on seafood market

33:50.340 --> 33:52.820
 wasn't like some of these seafood markets

33:52.820 --> 33:55.060
 that they have in Southern China or in Cambodia,

33:55.060 --> 33:57.140
 where I lived for two years.

33:57.140 --> 33:59.300
 I mean, it was a totally different thing.

33:59.300 --> 34:01.340
 I'm gonna have to talk to you about some of the,

34:01.340 --> 34:02.660
 including the Wuhan market,

34:02.660 --> 34:04.660
 just some of the wild food going on here.

34:04.660 --> 34:06.340
 Because you've traveled that part of the world.

34:06.340 --> 34:07.180
 But let's not get there.

34:07.180 --> 34:08.860
 Let's not get distracted.

34:08.860 --> 34:11.100
 Good, as I was telling you, Lex, before,

34:11.100 --> 34:13.780
 and this is maybe an advertisement,

34:13.780 --> 34:18.020
 is having now listened to a number of your podcasts

34:18.020 --> 34:20.380
 when I'm doing long ultra training runs

34:20.380 --> 34:22.260
 or driving in the mountains.

34:22.260 --> 34:23.660
 Like the really, because in the beginning,

34:23.660 --> 34:26.080
 we have to talk about whatever it is is the topic.

34:26.080 --> 34:28.340
 But the really good stuff happens later.

34:28.340 --> 34:29.180
 So stay tuned. So friends,

34:29.180 --> 34:31.340
 you should listen to the end.

34:31.340 --> 34:34.900
 I have to say, as I was telling you before,

34:34.900 --> 34:37.780
 like when I heard your long podcast with Jérôme Lanier

34:37.780 --> 34:41.140
 and he talked about his mother at the very end,

34:41.140 --> 34:42.740
 I mean, just beautiful stuff.

34:42.740 --> 34:45.500
 So I don't know whether I can match beautiful stuff,

34:45.500 --> 34:47.980
 but I'm gonna do my best.

34:47.980 --> 34:49.140
 You're gonna have to find out.

34:49.140 --> 34:50.820
 Exactly, stay tuned.

34:52.700 --> 34:54.900
 So France had this agreement

34:54.900 --> 34:57.900
 that they were going to help design and help build

34:57.900 --> 35:01.060
 this BSL4 lab in Wuhan.

35:01.060 --> 35:04.900
 And it was going to be with French standards,

35:04.900 --> 35:07.540
 and there were going to be 50 French experts

35:07.540 --> 35:09.420
 who were going to work there

35:09.420 --> 35:12.700
 and supervise the work that happened

35:12.700 --> 35:16.060
 even after the Wuhan Institute of Virology

35:16.060 --> 35:21.060
 in the new location started operating.

35:22.140 --> 35:24.460
 But then when they started building it,

35:24.460 --> 35:28.540
 the French contractors, the French overseers

35:28.540 --> 35:31.500
 were increasingly appalled

35:31.500 --> 35:33.420
 that they had less and less control,

35:33.420 --> 35:37.140
 that the Chinese contractors were swapping out new things,

35:37.140 --> 35:39.620
 it wasn't built up to French standards,

35:39.620 --> 35:44.180
 so much that at the end, when it was finally built,

35:44.180 --> 35:47.860
 the person who was the vice chairman of the project

35:47.860 --> 35:51.380
 and a leading French industrialist named Marieau

35:51.380 --> 35:52.980
 refused to sign off.

35:52.980 --> 35:55.620
 And he said, we can't support,

35:55.620 --> 35:58.220
 we have no idea what this is,

35:58.220 --> 36:00.220
 whether it's safe or not.

36:00.220 --> 36:02.980
 And when this lab opened,

36:02.980 --> 36:05.980
 remember it was supposed to have 50 French experts,

36:05.980 --> 36:07.900
 it had one French expert.

36:07.900 --> 36:11.340
 And so the French were really disgusted.

36:11.340 --> 36:14.740
 And actually when the Wuhan Institute of Virology

36:14.740 --> 36:19.460
 and its new location opened in 2018, two things happened.

36:19.460 --> 36:22.100
 One, French intelligence privately approached

36:22.100 --> 36:25.100
 US intelligence saying, we have a lot of concerns

36:25.100 --> 36:27.260
 about the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

36:27.260 --> 36:29.220
 about its safety, and we don't even know

36:29.220 --> 36:30.380
 who's operating there,

36:30.380 --> 36:34.020
 is it being used as a dual use facility?

36:34.020 --> 36:38.540
 And also in 2018, the US embassy in Beijing

36:38.540 --> 36:42.220
 sent some people down to Wuhan to go and look at,

36:42.220 --> 36:44.500
 well, at this laboratory.

36:44.500 --> 36:48.500
 And they wrote a scathing cable that Josh Rogin

36:48.500 --> 36:52.540
 from the Washington Post later got his hands on saying,

36:52.540 --> 36:54.140
 this is really unsafe,

36:54.140 --> 36:58.740
 they're doing work on dangerous bat coronaviruses

36:58.740 --> 37:02.700
 in conditions where a leak is possible.

37:02.700 --> 37:05.660
 And so then you mentioned Shujing Li,

37:05.660 --> 37:08.620
 and I'll connect that to these virologists

37:08.620 --> 37:11.100
 who I was talking about.

37:11.100 --> 37:14.220
 So there's a very credible thesis

37:14.220 --> 37:17.780
 that because these pathogenic outbreaks happen

37:17.780 --> 37:19.740
 in other parts of the world,

37:19.740 --> 37:24.660
 having partnerships with experts in those parts of the world

37:24.660 --> 37:28.020
 must be a foundation of our efforts.

37:28.020 --> 37:29.980
 We can't just bring everything home

37:29.980 --> 37:32.940
 because we know that viruses don't care about borders

37:32.940 --> 37:34.980
 and boundaries, and so if something happens there,

37:34.980 --> 37:36.180
 it's going to come here.

37:36.180 --> 37:41.180
 So very correctly, we have all kinds of partnerships

37:41.660 --> 37:43.980
 with experts in these labs,

37:43.980 --> 37:47.260
 and Shujing Li was one of those partners.

37:47.260 --> 37:51.380
 And her closest relationship was with Peter Daszak,

37:51.380 --> 37:53.980
 who's a British, I think now American,

37:53.980 --> 37:57.580
 but the president of a thing called EcoHealth Alliance,

37:57.580 --> 37:59.220
 which was getting money from NIH.

37:59.220 --> 38:01.780
 And basically, EcoHealth Alliance

38:01.780 --> 38:03.420
 was a pass through organization.

38:03.420 --> 38:06.580
 And over the years, it was only about $600,000.

38:06.580 --> 38:07.980
 So almost all of her funding

38:07.980 --> 38:09.260
 came from the Chinese government,

38:09.260 --> 38:11.780
 but there's a little bit that came from the United States.

38:11.780 --> 38:15.140
 And so she became their kind of leading expert

38:15.140 --> 38:17.620
 and the point of contact

38:17.620 --> 38:20.220
 between the Wuhan Institute of Virology

38:20.220 --> 38:25.220
 and certainly Peter Daszak, but also with others.

38:25.900 --> 38:28.860
 And that was why in the earliest days of the outbreak,

38:28.860 --> 38:30.340
 I didn't mention that,

38:30.340 --> 38:32.860
 I did mention that there were these virologists

38:32.860 --> 38:34.940
 who had this fake certainty

38:34.940 --> 38:36.620
 that they knew it came from nature

38:36.620 --> 38:38.860
 and it didn't come from a lab

38:38.860 --> 38:41.340
 and they called people like me conspiracy theorists

38:41.340 --> 38:43.860
 just for raising that possibility.

38:43.860 --> 38:46.820
 But when Peter Daszak was organizing that effort

38:46.820 --> 38:50.020
 in February of 2020,

38:50.020 --> 38:52.460
 what he said is we need to rally

38:52.460 --> 38:54.100
 behind our Chinese colleagues.

38:54.100 --> 38:55.940
 And the basic idea was

38:56.820 --> 38:59.660
 these international collaborations are under threat.

38:59.660 --> 39:01.300
 And I think it was because of that,

39:01.300 --> 39:06.300
 because Peter Daszak's basically his major contribution

39:06.340 --> 39:09.180
 as a scientist was just tacking his name

39:09.180 --> 39:12.940
 on work that Shujang Li had largely done.

39:12.940 --> 39:14.420
 He was defending a lot,

39:14.420 --> 39:16.820
 certainly for himself and his organization.

39:16.820 --> 39:20.620
 So you think EcoHealth Alliance and Peter

39:20.620 --> 39:21.980
 is less about money,

39:21.980 --> 39:24.740
 it's more about kind of almost like legacy

39:24.740 --> 39:26.660
 because you're so attached to this work?

39:26.660 --> 39:27.860
 Is it just on a human level?

39:27.860 --> 39:29.060
 I think so.

39:29.060 --> 39:31.860
 I mean, I've been criticized for being actually,

39:31.860 --> 39:34.780
 I'm certainly a big critic of Peter Daszak,

39:34.780 --> 39:38.460
 but I've been criticized by some for being too lenient.

39:38.460 --> 39:39.940
 I mean, it's so easy to say,

39:39.940 --> 39:43.140
 oh, somebody they're like an evil ogre

39:43.140 --> 39:45.460
 and just trying to do evil

39:45.460 --> 39:49.700
 and cackling in their closet or whatever.

39:49.700 --> 39:51.140
 But I think for most of us,

39:51.140 --> 39:55.460
 even those of us who do terrible, horrible things,

39:55.460 --> 39:57.620
 the story that we tell ourselves

39:57.620 --> 40:01.060
 and we really believe is that we're doing the thing

40:01.060 --> 40:02.540
 that we most believe in.

40:02.540 --> 40:04.540
 I mean, I did my PhD dissertation

40:04.540 --> 40:06.780
 on the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.

40:06.780 --> 40:09.940
 They genuinely saw themselves as idealists.

40:09.940 --> 40:13.860
 They thought, well, we need to make radical change

40:13.860 --> 40:15.660
 to build a better future.

40:15.660 --> 40:17.740
 And what they described as,

40:17.740 --> 40:19.100
 that they felt was radical change

40:19.100 --> 40:21.900
 was a monstrous atrocities by us.

40:21.900 --> 40:24.100
 So the criticism here of Peter

40:26.980 --> 40:31.820
 is that he was a part of an organization

40:31.820 --> 40:36.460
 that was kind of, well, funding an effort

40:36.460 --> 40:39.020
 that was an unsafe implementation

40:39.020 --> 40:42.060
 of a biosafety level four laboratory.

40:42.060 --> 40:43.340
 Well, a few things.

40:43.340 --> 40:47.980
 So what he thought he was doing was,

40:47.980 --> 40:49.580
 and then what he thought he was doing

40:49.580 --> 40:51.700
 is itself highly controversial

40:51.700 --> 40:56.340
 because there's one there that in 2011,

40:56.340 --> 40:57.860
 there were, I know you've talked about this

40:57.860 --> 41:00.620
 with other guests, but in 2011,

41:00.620 --> 41:04.020
 there were the first published papers

41:04.020 --> 41:07.500
 on this now infamous gain of function research.

41:07.500 --> 41:10.540
 And basically what they did,

41:10.540 --> 41:14.620
 both in different labs and certainly in the United States,

41:14.620 --> 41:18.660
 in Wisconsin and in the Netherlands,

41:18.660 --> 41:21.980
 was they had a bird flu virus

41:21.980 --> 41:26.980
 that was very dangerous, but not massively transmissive.

41:28.540 --> 41:31.620
 And they had a gain of function process

41:31.620 --> 41:33.660
 through what's called serial passage,

41:33.660 --> 41:35.620
 which means basically passing advice,

41:35.620 --> 41:39.260
 like natural selection, but forcing natural selection

41:39.260 --> 41:42.500
 by just passing a virus through different cell cultures

41:42.500 --> 41:46.340
 and then selecting for what it is that you want.

41:46.340 --> 41:49.500
 So relatively easily, they took this deadly,

41:49.500 --> 41:51.900
 but not massively transmissive virus

41:51.900 --> 41:53.940
 and turned it into, in a lab,

41:53.940 --> 41:57.380
 a deadly and transmissive virus.

41:57.380 --> 41:59.580
 And that showed that this is really dangerous.

41:59.580 --> 42:01.220
 And so there were, at that point,

42:01.220 --> 42:03.060
 there was a huge controversy.

42:03.060 --> 42:07.140
 There were some people, like Richard Ebright

42:07.140 --> 42:09.580
 and Mark Lipsitch at Harvard,

42:09.580 --> 42:12.500
 who were saying that this is really dangerous.

42:12.500 --> 42:16.900
 We're in the idea that we need to create monsters

42:16.900 --> 42:17.900
 to study monsters.

42:17.900 --> 42:21.180
 I think maybe even you have said that in the past.

42:21.180 --> 42:22.340
 It doesn't make sense

42:22.340 --> 42:24.660
 because there's an unlimited number of monsters.

42:24.660 --> 42:25.820
 And so what are we gonna do?

42:25.820 --> 42:27.500
 Create an unlimited number of monsters.

42:27.500 --> 42:28.460
 And if we do that,

42:28.460 --> 42:31.460
 eventually the monsters are going to get out.

42:31.460 --> 42:33.660
 Then there was the Peter Daszak camp,

42:33.660 --> 42:35.460
 and he got a lot of funding,

42:35.460 --> 42:37.260
 particularly from the United States,

42:37.260 --> 42:40.340
 who said, well, and certainly Collins and Fauci

42:40.340 --> 42:42.020
 were supportive of this.

42:42.020 --> 42:44.660
 And they thought, well, there's a safe way

42:44.660 --> 42:46.380
 to go out into the world

42:46.380 --> 42:49.620
 to collect the world's most dangerous viruses

42:49.620 --> 42:52.180
 and to poke and prod them

42:52.180 --> 42:54.260
 to figure out how they might mutate,

42:54.260 --> 42:56.420
 how they might become more dangerous

42:56.420 --> 43:01.420
 with the goal of predicting future pandemics.

43:01.580 --> 43:03.660
 And that certainly never happened

43:03.660 --> 43:07.980
 with the goal of creating vaccines and treatments.

43:07.980 --> 43:11.180
 And that largely never happened,

43:11.180 --> 43:14.380
 but that was, so Peter Daszak kind of epitomized

43:14.380 --> 43:18.180
 that second approach.

43:18.180 --> 43:20.980
 And as you've talked about in the past,

43:20.980 --> 43:24.100
 in 2014, there was a funding moratorium

43:24.100 --> 43:27.940
 in the United States, and then in 2017, that was lifted.

43:27.940 --> 43:29.100
 It didn't affect the funding

43:29.100 --> 43:33.380
 that went to the EcoHealth Alliance.

43:33.380 --> 43:37.020
 So when this happened in the beginning,

43:37.020 --> 43:40.060
 and again, coming back to Peter's motivations,

43:40.060 --> 43:44.020
 I don't think, here's the best case scenario for Peter.

43:44.020 --> 43:47.100
 I'm gonna give you what I imagine he was thinking,

43:47.100 --> 43:49.740
 and then I'll tell you what I actually think.

43:49.740 --> 43:51.740
 So I think here's what he's thinking.

43:51.740 --> 43:56.340
 This is most likely a natural origin outbreak.

43:56.340 --> 44:00.420
 Just like SARS one, again, in Peter's hypothetical mind,

44:00.420 --> 44:04.540
 just like SARS one, this is most likely a natural outbreak.

44:04.540 --> 44:06.980
 We need to have an international coalition

44:06.980 --> 44:08.700
 in order to fight it.

44:08.700 --> 44:11.980
 If we allow these political attacks

44:11.980 --> 44:14.180
 to undermine our Chinese counterparts

44:14.180 --> 44:16.220
 and the trust in these relationships

44:16.220 --> 44:18.500
 that we've built over many years,

44:18.500 --> 44:20.660
 we're really screwed because they have

44:20.660 --> 44:23.780
 the most local knowledge of these outbreaks.

44:23.780 --> 44:27.700
 And even though, and this guy gets a lot more complicated,

44:27.700 --> 44:30.700
 even though there are basic questions

44:30.700 --> 44:34.700
 that anybody would ask and that Shujing Li herself did ask

44:34.700 --> 44:37.700
 about the origins of this pandemic,

44:37.700 --> 44:40.900
 even though Peter Daszak, and I'll describe this

44:40.900 --> 44:44.980
 in a moment, had secret information that we didn't have,

44:44.980 --> 44:48.340
 that in my mind massively increases the possibility

44:48.340 --> 44:52.340
 of a lab incident origin, I, Peter Daszak,

44:52.340 --> 44:55.860
 would like to guide the public conversation

44:55.860 --> 44:58.860
 in the direction where I think it should go

44:58.860 --> 45:03.580
 and in support of the kind of international collaboration

45:03.580 --> 45:04.660
 that I think is necessary.

45:04.660 --> 45:06.260
 That's a strong, positive discussion

45:06.260 --> 45:11.260
 because it's true that there's a lot of political BS

45:11.940 --> 45:16.940
 and a lot of kind of just bickering and lies

45:16.940 --> 45:18.940
 as we've talked about.

45:18.940 --> 45:21.100
 And so it's very convenient to say, you know what?

45:21.100 --> 45:24.080
 Let's just ignore all of these quote unquote lies

45:24.080 --> 45:26.220
 and my favorite word, misinformation.

45:27.140 --> 45:31.780
 And then because the way out from this serious pandemic

45:31.780 --> 45:33.420
 is for us to work together.

45:33.420 --> 45:36.260
 So let's strengthen our partnerships

45:36.260 --> 45:38.460
 and everything else is just like noise.

45:38.460 --> 45:41.020
 Yeah, so let's, and so then now I wanna do

45:41.020 --> 45:43.460
 my personal indictment of Peter Daszak

45:43.460 --> 45:46.380
 because that's my view, but I wanted to fairly.

45:46.380 --> 45:47.220
 That's nice.

45:47.220 --> 45:51.700
 Because I think that we all tell ourselves stories

45:51.700 --> 45:56.380
 and also when you're a science communicator,

45:56.380 --> 45:59.220
 you can't in your public communications

45:59.220 --> 46:03.300
 give every doubt that you have or every nuance,

46:03.300 --> 46:05.820
 you kind of have to summarize things.

46:05.820 --> 46:07.580
 And so I think that he was, again,

46:07.580 --> 46:10.780
 in this benign interpretation trying to summarize

46:10.780 --> 46:14.100
 in the way that he thought the conversations should go.

46:14.100 --> 46:16.700
 Here's my indictment of Peter Daszak.

46:16.700 --> 46:20.940
 And I feel like a Brutus here,

46:20.940 --> 46:25.940
 but I have not come here to praise Peter Daszak

46:26.060 --> 46:29.260
 because while Peter Daszak was doing all of this

46:29.260 --> 46:31.660
 and making all of these statements about,

46:31.660 --> 46:34.380
 well, we pretty much know it's a natural origin.

46:34.380 --> 46:38.140
 Then there was this February, 2020 Lancet letter

46:38.140 --> 46:40.940
 where it turns out, and we only knew this later

46:40.940 --> 46:42.820
 that he was highly manipulative.

46:42.820 --> 46:45.260
 So he was recruiting all of these people.

46:45.260 --> 46:48.940
 He drafted the infamous letter calling people like me,

46:48.940 --> 46:50.620
 conspiracy theorists.

46:50.620 --> 46:54.500
 He then wrote to people like Ralph Barak and Linfa Wang,

46:54.500 --> 46:57.180
 who are also very high profile virologists saying,

46:57.180 --> 46:59.060
 well, let's not put our names on it.

46:59.060 --> 47:01.900
 So it doesn't look like we're doing it,

47:01.900 --> 47:04.500
 even though they were doing it.

47:04.500 --> 47:09.380
 He didn't disclose a lot of information that they had.

47:09.380 --> 47:10.820
 It was a strategic move.

47:10.820 --> 47:13.700
 So just in case people are not familiar,

47:13.700 --> 47:18.700
 February, 2020, Lancet letter was TLDR,

47:20.100 --> 47:24.900
 is a lab leak hypothesis, is a conspiracy theory.

47:24.900 --> 47:26.620
 Essentially, yes.

47:26.620 --> 47:29.580
 So like with the authority of science,

47:29.580 --> 47:32.300
 not saying like it's highly likely,

47:32.300 --> 47:37.300
 saying it's obvious, duh, it's natural origin.

47:37.300 --> 47:40.780
 Everybody else is just,

47:40.780 --> 47:42.780
 everything else is just misinformation.

47:42.780 --> 47:44.900
 And look, there's a bunch of really smart people

47:44.900 --> 47:46.380
 that signed this, therefore it's true.

47:46.380 --> 47:49.540
 Yeah, not only that, so there were the people

47:49.540 --> 47:51.700
 who, 27 people signed that letter.

47:51.700 --> 47:54.380
 And then after President Trump cut funding

47:54.380 --> 47:58.980
 to EcoHealth Alliance, then he organized 77 Nobel laureates

47:58.980 --> 48:01.700
 to have a public letter criticizing that.

48:01.700 --> 48:06.420
 But what Peter knew then that we didn't fully know

48:06.420 --> 48:10.980
 is that in March of 2018, EcoHealth Alliance,

48:10.980 --> 48:13.660
 in partnership with the Wuhan Institute of Virology

48:13.660 --> 48:18.660
 and others, had applied for a $14 million grant to DARPA,

48:19.340 --> 48:23.300
 which is kind of like the VC side of the venture capital

48:23.300 --> 48:25.540
 side of the Defense Department.

48:25.540 --> 48:29.380
 They're kind of, where they do kind of big ideas.

48:29.380 --> 48:31.180
 By the way, as a tiny tangent,

48:31.180 --> 48:33.940
 I've gotten a lot of funding from DARPA.

48:33.940 --> 48:36.340
 They fund a lot of excellent robotics research.

48:36.340 --> 48:37.700
 And DARPA is incredible.

48:37.700 --> 48:39.940
 And among the things that they applied for

48:39.940 --> 48:42.420
 is that we, meaning Wuhan Institute of Virology,

48:42.420 --> 48:44.980
 is gonna go and it's gonna collect

48:44.980 --> 48:49.420
 the most dangerous bat coronaviruses in Southern China.

48:49.420 --> 48:52.340
 And then we, as this group,

48:52.340 --> 48:56.620
 are going to genetically engineer these viruses

48:56.620 --> 48:59.780
 to insert a furin cleavage site.

48:59.780 --> 49:02.620
 So I think when everyone's now seen the image

49:02.620 --> 49:06.320
 of the SARS CoV2 virus, it has these little spike proteins,

49:06.320 --> 49:07.940
 these little things that stick out,

49:07.940 --> 49:09.900
 which is why they call it a coronavirus.

49:09.900 --> 49:12.400
 Within that spike protein are these furin cleavage sites,

49:12.400 --> 49:14.840
 which basically help with the virus

49:14.840 --> 49:18.060
 getting access into our cells.

49:18.060 --> 49:20.140
 And they were going to genetically engineer

49:20.140 --> 49:24.180
 these furin cleavage sites into these bat coronaviruses,

49:24.180 --> 49:26.380
 the serbicoviruses.

49:26.380 --> 49:30.700
 And then, and so then a year and a half later,

49:30.700 --> 49:31.720
 what do we see?

49:31.720 --> 49:36.720
 We see a bat coronavirus with a furin cleavage site

49:36.740 --> 49:39.840
 unlike anything that we've ever seen before

49:39.840 --> 49:44.200
 in that category of SARS like coronaviruses.

49:44.200 --> 49:49.060
 That, well, yes, I mean, the DARPA very correctly

49:49.060 --> 49:50.900
 didn't support that application.

49:50.900 --> 49:53.140
 Well, let's actually, let's like pause on that.

49:53.140 --> 49:56.100
 So for a lot of people, that's like the smoking gun.

49:56.100 --> 50:01.100
 Okay, let's talk about this 2018 proposal to DARPA.

50:02.240 --> 50:04.180
 So I guess who's drafted the proposal?

50:04.180 --> 50:09.180
 Is it EcoHealth, but the proposal is to do research.

50:09.260 --> 50:14.260
 EcoHealth is technically a US funded organization.

50:14.660 --> 50:15.500
 Primarily.

50:15.500 --> 50:18.500
 And then the idea was to do work

50:18.500 --> 50:20.860
 at Wuhan Institute of Virology.

50:20.860 --> 50:22.340
 With, yeah, so it was.

50:22.340 --> 50:23.160
 With EcoHealth.

50:23.160 --> 50:26.980
 Yes, so EcoHealth, basically the Wuhan Institute of Virology

50:26.980 --> 50:29.900
 was gonna go and they were gonna collect these viruses

50:29.900 --> 50:31.860
 and store them at Wuhan Institute of Virology.

50:31.860 --> 50:33.660
 But they're also gonna do the actual task.

50:33.660 --> 50:35.500
 According, it's a really important point.

50:35.500 --> 50:38.580
 According to their proposal, the actual work

50:38.580 --> 50:41.780
 was going to be done at the lab of Ralph Barak

50:41.780 --> 50:43.420
 at the University of North Carolina,

50:43.420 --> 50:47.860
 who's probably the world's leading expert on coronaviruses.

50:47.860 --> 50:52.860
 And so we know that DARPA didn't fund that work.

50:54.080 --> 50:59.080
 We know, I think quite well that Ralph Barak's lab,

50:59.080 --> 51:04.080
 in part because it was not funded by DARPA,

51:04.080 --> 51:06.200
 they didn't do that specific work.

51:06.200 --> 51:10.200
 What we don't know is, well, what work was done

51:10.200 --> 51:12.400
 at the Wuhan Institute of Virology

51:12.400 --> 51:15.600
 because WIV was part of this proposal.

51:15.600 --> 51:18.280
 They had access to all of the plans.

51:18.280 --> 51:21.000
 They had done, they had their own capacity

51:21.000 --> 51:23.520
 and they had already done a lot of work

51:23.520 --> 51:28.520
 in genetically altering this exact category of viruses.

51:28.760 --> 51:33.240
 They had created chimeric mixed viruses.

51:33.240 --> 51:37.680
 They had mastered pretty much all of the steps

51:37.680 --> 51:39.920
 in order to achieve this thing that they applied

51:39.920 --> 51:42.720
 for funding with EcoHealth to do.

51:42.720 --> 51:47.720
 And so the question is, did the Wuhan Institute of Virology

51:47.720 --> 51:50.320
 go through with that research anyway?

51:50.320 --> 51:53.760
 And in my mind, that's a very, very real possibility.

51:53.760 --> 51:54.600
 It would certainly explain

51:54.600 --> 51:57.000
 why they're giving no information.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.920
 And as you know, I've been a member

51:59.920 --> 52:02.520
 of the World Health Organization Expert Advisory Committee

52:02.520 --> 52:06.000
 on Human Genome Editing, which Dr. Tedros created

52:06.000 --> 52:07.720
 in the aftermath of the announcement

52:07.720 --> 52:10.160
 of the world's first CRISPR babies.

52:10.160 --> 52:11.760
 And it was just basically the first time

52:11.760 --> 52:14.320
 and it was just basically the exact same story.

52:14.320 --> 52:16.720
 So Ho Chiang Kui, a Chinese scientist,

52:16.720 --> 52:18.160
 it was not a first tier scientist,

52:18.160 --> 52:21.240
 but a perfectly adequate second tier scientist,

52:21.240 --> 52:23.840
 came to the United States, learned all of these capacities,

52:23.840 --> 52:25.180
 went back to China and said,

52:25.180 --> 52:28.160
 well, there's a much more permissive environment.

52:28.160 --> 52:30.560
 I'm gonna be a world leader.

52:30.560 --> 52:33.280
 I'm gonna establish both myself and China.

52:33.280 --> 52:37.280
 So in every scientific field, we're seeing this same thing

52:37.280 --> 52:41.540
 where you kind of learn a model and then you do it in China.

52:41.540 --> 52:45.640
 So is it possible that the Wuhan Institute of Virology

52:45.640 --> 52:49.920
 with this exact game plan was doing it anyway?

52:49.920 --> 52:51.800
 Do we, possible?

52:51.800 --> 52:55.080
 We have no clue what work was being done

52:55.080 --> 52:56.880
 at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

52:56.880 --> 52:59.840
 It seems extremely likely

52:59.840 --> 53:02.080
 that at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

53:02.080 --> 53:04.520
 and this is certainly the US government position,

53:04.520 --> 53:08.320
 there was the work that was being done in Dr. Hsu's lab,

53:08.320 --> 53:10.320
 but that wasn't the whole WIV.

53:10.320 --> 53:12.600
 We know, at least according to the United States government,

53:12.600 --> 53:14.180
 that there was the Chinese military,

53:14.180 --> 53:17.560
 that PLA was doing work there.

53:17.560 --> 53:22.140
 Were they doing this kind of work, not to create a bioweapon,

53:22.140 --> 53:25.120
 but in order to understand these viruses,

53:25.120 --> 53:28.280
 maybe to develop vaccines and treatments?

53:28.280 --> 53:33.160
 It seems like a very, very logical possibility.

53:33.160 --> 53:36.280
 And then, so we know that the Wuhan Institute of Virology

53:36.280 --> 53:37.600
 had all of the skills.

53:37.600 --> 53:40.640
 We know that they were part of this proposal.

53:40.640 --> 53:43.760
 And then you have Peter Daszak, who knows all of this,

53:43.760 --> 53:47.360
 that at that time, in February of 2020, we didn't know.

53:47.360 --> 53:49.560
 But then he comes swinging out of the gate,

53:49.560 --> 53:52.600
 saying anybody who's raising this possibility

53:52.600 --> 53:57.000
 of a lab incident origin is a conspiracy theorist.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.480
 I mean, it really makes him look, in my mind,

54:00.480 --> 54:01.400
 very, very bad.

54:01.400 --> 54:04.480
 And yet, not to at least be somewhat open minded on this,

54:04.480 --> 54:06.080
 because he knows all the details.

54:06.080 --> 54:08.960
 He knows that it's not 0%.

54:08.960 --> 54:12.040
 I mean, there's no way in his mind could you even argue that.

54:12.040 --> 54:14.160
 So it's potential because of the bias,

54:14.160 --> 54:16.120
 because of your focus.

54:16.120 --> 54:20.240
 I mean, it could be the Anthony Fauci masks thing,

54:20.240 --> 54:23.280
 whereas he knows there's some significant probability

54:23.280 --> 54:24.200
 that this is happening.

54:24.200 --> 54:28.680
 But in order to preserve good relations

54:28.680 --> 54:30.120
 with our Chinese colleagues,

54:30.120 --> 54:33.000
 we want to make sure we tell a certain kind of narrative.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.720
 So it's not really lying.

54:34.720 --> 54:39.200
 It's doing the best possible action at this time

54:39.200 --> 54:40.400
 to help the world.

54:40.400 --> 54:42.160
 Not that this already happened.

54:42.160 --> 54:43.760
 But that's how like...

54:43.760 --> 54:47.480
 I think it's quite likely that that was the story

54:47.480 --> 54:49.440
 that he was telling himself.

54:49.440 --> 54:54.440
 But it's that lack of transparency, in my mind,

54:55.280 --> 54:59.320
 is fraudulent, that we were struggling

54:59.320 --> 55:02.520
 to understand something that we didn't understand.

55:02.520 --> 55:05.280
 And that I just think that people who possess

55:05.280 --> 55:10.040
 that kind of information, especially when the existence,

55:10.040 --> 55:12.280
 like the entire career of Peter Daszak

55:12.280 --> 55:14.320
 is based on US taxpayers,

55:14.320 --> 55:16.760
 there's a debt that comes with that.

55:16.760 --> 55:19.040
 And that debt is honesty and transparency.

55:19.040 --> 55:21.000
 And for all of us, and you talked about

55:21.000 --> 55:22.880
 your girlfriend checking your phone.

55:22.880 --> 55:26.280
 For all of us, being honest and transparent

55:26.280 --> 55:29.240
 in the most difficult times is really difficult.

55:29.240 --> 55:31.360
 If it were easy, everybody would do it.

55:31.360 --> 55:36.360
 And I just feel that Peter was the opposite of transparent

55:37.400 --> 55:39.800
 and then went on the offensive.

55:39.800 --> 55:44.400
 And then had the gall of joining,

55:44.400 --> 55:46.080
 I know we can talk about this,

55:46.080 --> 55:51.080
 this highly compromised joint study process

55:51.560 --> 55:54.360
 with the international experts

55:54.360 --> 55:56.640
 and their Chinese government counterparts.

55:56.640 --> 55:59.960
 And used that as a way of furthering

55:59.960 --> 56:04.960
 this, in my mind, fraudulent narrative

56:05.040 --> 56:09.040
 that it almost certainly came from natural origins

56:09.040 --> 56:12.760
 and a lab origin was extremely unlikely.

56:12.760 --> 56:15.920
 Just to stick briefly on the proposal to wrap that up,

56:15.920 --> 56:20.920
 because I do think, in a kind of John Stewart way,

56:22.000 --> 56:25.440
 if you heard that a bit yet,

56:25.440 --> 56:30.440
 sort of kind of like common sense way,

56:30.480 --> 56:35.400
 the 2018 proposal to DARPA from EcoHealth Alliance

56:35.400 --> 56:38.240
 and Wuhan Institute of Virology,

56:38.240 --> 56:41.800
 just seems like a bit of a smoking gun to me, like that.

56:43.680 --> 56:46.800
 So there's this excellent book that people should read

56:46.800 --> 56:50.280
 called Viral, The Search for the Origin of COVID 19.

56:50.280 --> 56:54.480
 Matt Ridley and Alena Chan, I think Alena is in MIT.

56:54.480 --> 56:55.760
 Probably. At the Broad, yeah.

56:55.760 --> 56:57.800
 At Broad Institute, yeah, yeah.

56:57.800 --> 57:00.840
 So she, I heard her in an interview

57:00.840 --> 57:04.040
 give this analogy of unicorns.

57:04.040 --> 57:09.040
 And where basically somebody writes a proposal

57:09.200 --> 57:14.200
 to add horns to horses, the proposal is rejected.

57:14.520 --> 57:17.800
 And then a couple of years later or a year later,

57:17.800 --> 57:19.040
 a unicorn shows up.

57:19.920 --> 57:23.240
 In the place where they're proposing to do it.

57:23.240 --> 57:24.080
 I mean, that's so, I had.

57:24.080 --> 57:26.800
 And then everyone's like, it's natural origin.

57:26.800 --> 57:29.000
 It's like, it's possible it's natural origin.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
 Like we haven't detected a unicorn yet.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.720
 And this is the first time we've detected a unicorn.

57:33.720 --> 57:36.800
 Or it could be this massive organization

57:36.800 --> 57:39.520
 that was planning, is fully equipped,

57:39.520 --> 57:42.840
 has like a history of being able to do this stuff,

57:42.840 --> 57:45.120
 has the world experts to do it, has the funding,

57:45.120 --> 57:48.600
 has the motivation to add horns to horses.

57:48.600 --> 57:52.160
 And now a unicorn shows up and they're saying, nope.

57:52.160 --> 57:54.360
 Definitely natural.

57:54.360 --> 57:56.800
 That connects to your first question

57:56.800 --> 57:59.160
 of how do I get to my 85%?

57:59.160 --> 58:03.080
 And here's a summary of that answer.

58:03.080 --> 58:06.280
 And so it's what I said in my 60 Minutes interview

58:06.280 --> 58:07.960
 a long time ago, of all the gin joints

58:07.960 --> 58:09.240
 and all the towns and all the world,

58:09.240 --> 58:11.800
 the quote from Casablanca.

58:11.800 --> 58:14.600
 And so of all the places in the world

58:14.600 --> 58:19.600
 where we have an outbreak of a SARS like bat coronavirus,

58:19.600 --> 58:23.320
 it's not in the area of the natural habitat

58:23.320 --> 58:25.400
 of the horseshoe bats.

58:25.400 --> 58:28.920
 It's the one city in China

58:28.920 --> 58:33.080
 with the first and largest level four virology lab,

58:33.080 --> 58:34.680
 which actually wasn't even using it.

58:34.680 --> 58:38.160
 They were doing level three and level two for this work,

58:38.160 --> 58:39.840
 where they had the world's largest collection

58:39.840 --> 58:41.960
 of bat coronaviruses,

58:41.960 --> 58:45.200
 where they were doing aggressive experiments

58:45.200 --> 58:49.760
 designed to make these scary viruses scarier,

58:49.760 --> 58:52.960
 where they had been part of an application

58:52.960 --> 58:56.040
 to insert a furin cleavage site,

58:56.040 --> 58:59.920
 able to infect human cells.

58:59.920 --> 59:02.960
 And when the outbreak happened,

59:02.960 --> 59:07.120
 we had a virus that was ready for action to infect humans.

59:07.120 --> 59:09.800
 And to this day, better able to infect humans

59:09.800 --> 59:13.440
 than any other species, including bats.

59:13.440 --> 59:17.400
 And then from day one, there's this massive coverup.

59:17.400 --> 59:19.080
 And then on top of that,

59:19.080 --> 59:21.880
 in spite of lots of efforts by lots of people,

59:21.880 --> 59:24.680
 there's basically no evidence

59:24.680 --> 59:27.280
 for the natural origin hypothesis.

59:27.280 --> 59:29.920
 Everything that I've described just now is circumstantial,

59:29.920 --> 59:31.760
 but there's a certain point

59:31.760 --> 59:34.240
 where you add up the circumstances

59:34.240 --> 59:37.520
 and you see this seems pretty, pretty likely.

59:37.520 --> 59:39.560
 I mean, if we're getting to 100%,

59:39.560 --> 59:42.160
 we are not at 100% by any means.

59:42.160 --> 59:45.320
 There still is a possibility of a natural origin.

59:45.320 --> 59:46.840
 And if we find that, great.

59:46.840 --> 59:48.920
 But from everything that I know,

59:48.920 --> 59:50.600
 that's how I get to my 85.

59:50.600 --> 59:53.960
 And we'll talk about why this matters

59:53.960 --> 59:56.320
 in the political sense, in the human sense,

59:56.320 --> 59:59.040
 in the science, in the realm of science,

59:59.040 --> 1:00:00.120
 all of those factors.

1:00:00.120 --> 1:00:04.040
 But first, as Nietzsche said, let us look into the abyss

1:00:04.040 --> 1:00:06.040
 and the games we'll play with monsters.

1:00:06.040 --> 1:00:12.240
 That is colloquially called gain of function research.

1:00:12.240 --> 1:00:14.680
 Let me ask the kind of political sounding question,

1:00:14.680 --> 1:00:16.840
 which is how people usually phrase it.

1:00:16.840 --> 1:00:24.120
 Did Anthony Fauci fund gain of function research

1:00:24.120 --> 1:00:26.800
 at the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:27.800
 So it depends.

1:00:27.800 --> 1:00:31.560
 I mean, I've obviously been very closely monitoring this.

1:00:31.560 --> 1:00:32.800
 I've spoken a lot about it.

1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:34.680
 I've written about it.

1:00:34.680 --> 1:00:37.800
 And it depends on, I mean, not to quote Bill Clinton,

1:00:37.800 --> 1:00:39.920
 but to quote Bill Clinton, it depends on what

1:00:39.920 --> 1:00:41.800
 the definition of is is.

1:00:41.800 --> 1:00:46.640
 And so if you use a common sense definition of gain of function,

1:00:46.640 --> 1:00:48.680
 and by gain of function, there are lots of things

1:00:48.680 --> 1:00:50.640
 like gene therapies that are gain of function.

1:00:50.640 --> 1:00:52.680
 But here, what we mean is gain of function

1:00:52.680 --> 1:01:00.280
 for pathogens potentially able to create human pandemics.

1:01:00.280 --> 1:01:04.040
 But if you use the kind of common sense language,

1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:05.640
 well, then he probably did.

1:01:05.640 --> 1:01:10.680
 If you use the technical language from a 2017 NIH

1:01:10.680 --> 1:01:14.880
 document, and you read that language very narrowly,

1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:19.400
 I think you can make a credible argument that he did not.

1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:22.800
 There's a question, though, and Francis Collins

1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:25.640
 talked about that in his interview with you.

1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:28.760
 But then there's a question that we know from now

1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:31.760
 that we have the information of the reports submitted

1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:36.320
 by EcoHealth Alliance to the NIH, and some of which

1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:40.440
 were late or not even delivered, that some of this research

1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:45.920
 was done on MERS, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome virus.

1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:49.160
 And if that was the case, there is, I think,

1:01:49.160 --> 1:01:53.640
 a colorable argument that that would be considered

1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:58.040
 gain of function research even by the narrow language

1:01:58.040 --> 1:01:59.360
 of that 2017 document.

1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:02.960
 But I definitely think, and I've said this repeatedly,

1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:08.080
 that Rand Paul can be right, and Tony Fauci can be right.

1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:12.120
 And the question is, how are we defining gain of function?

1:02:12.120 --> 1:02:14.480
 And that's why I've always said the question in my mind

1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:17.680
 isn't, was it or wasn't it gain of function,

1:02:17.680 --> 1:02:22.280
 as if that's like a binary thing, if not, grade,

1:02:22.280 --> 1:02:23.960
 and if yes, guilty.

1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:27.200
 The question is just, what work was being done at the Wuhan

1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:28.760
 Institute of Virology?

1:02:28.760 --> 1:02:33.480
 What role, if any, did US government funding

1:02:33.480 --> 1:02:36.920
 play in supporting that work?

1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:41.320
 And what rights do we all have as human beings

1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:43.680
 and as American citizens and taxpayers

1:02:43.680 --> 1:02:47.120
 to get all of the relevant information about that?

1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:51.200
 So let's try to kind of dissect this.

1:02:51.200 --> 1:02:55.160
 So who frustrates you more, Rand Paul or Anthony

1:02:55.160 --> 1:02:57.720
 Fauci in his discussion or the discussion itself?

1:02:57.720 --> 1:03:00.760
 So for example, gain of function is

1:03:00.760 --> 1:03:06.600
 a term that's kind of more used just

1:03:06.600 --> 1:03:11.640
 to mean playing with viruses in the lab

1:03:11.640 --> 1:03:16.240
 to try to develop more dangerous viruses.

1:03:16.240 --> 1:03:22.200
 Is this kind of research a good idea?

1:03:22.200 --> 1:03:26.840
 Is it also a good idea for us to talk about it in public,

1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:29.920
 in the political way that it's been talked about?

1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:38.000
 Is it OK that US may have funded gain of function research

1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:39.040
 elsewhere?

1:03:39.040 --> 1:03:43.600
 I mean, it's kind of assumed, just like with Bill Clinton,

1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:46.760
 there was very little discussion of, I think,

1:03:46.760 --> 1:03:49.680
 correct me if I'm wrong, but whether it's

1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:54.120
 OK for a president, male or female,

1:03:54.120 --> 1:03:58.760
 to have extramarital sex or is it

1:03:58.760 --> 1:04:04.000
 OK for a president to have extramarital sex

1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:08.920
 with people on his staff or her staff?

1:04:08.920 --> 1:04:12.320
 It was more the discussion of lying, I think.

1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:16.240
 It was, did you lie about having sex or not?

1:04:16.240 --> 1:04:18.360
 And in this gain of function discussion,

1:04:18.360 --> 1:04:21.240
 what frustrates me personally is there's not

1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:23.720
 a deep philosophical discussion about whether we

1:04:23.720 --> 1:04:25.760
 should be doing this kind of research

1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:32.360
 and what are the ethical lines, research on animals at all.

1:04:32.360 --> 1:04:33.640
 Those are fascinating questions.

1:04:33.640 --> 1:04:36.480
 Instead, it's a gotcha thing.

1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:40.440
 Did you or did you not fund research on gain of function?

1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:43.720
 And did you fund, it's almost like a bioweapon.

1:04:43.720 --> 1:04:47.920
 Did you give money to China to develop this bioweapon that

1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:49.760
 now attacked the rest of the world?

1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:52.800
 So I mean, all those things are pretty frustrating,

1:04:52.800 --> 1:04:56.000
 but is there, I think, the thing you

1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:59.160
 can untangle about Anthony Fauci and gain of function

1:04:59.160 --> 1:05:01.720
 research in the United States and the EcoHealth Alliance

1:05:01.720 --> 1:05:07.440
 and Wuhan Institute of Virology that's clarifying.

1:05:07.440 --> 1:05:08.800
 What were the mistakes made?

1:05:08.800 --> 1:05:09.280
 Sure.

1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:11.600
 So on gain of function, there actually

1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:14.360
 has been a lot of debate.

1:05:14.360 --> 1:05:18.000
 I mentioned before in 2011, these first papers,

1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:20.120
 there was a big debate.

1:05:20.120 --> 1:05:22.640
 Mark Lipsitch, who's formerly at Harvard now

1:05:22.640 --> 1:05:26.960
 with the US government working in the president's office,

1:05:26.960 --> 1:05:29.840
 he led a thing called the Cambridge Group that

1:05:29.840 --> 1:05:32.600
 was highly critical of this work,

1:05:32.600 --> 1:05:35.720
 basically saying we're creating monsters.

1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:39.200
 They had the funding pause in 2014.

1:05:39.200 --> 1:05:42.720
 They spent three years putting together a framework,

1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:45.280
 and then they lifted it in 2017.

1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:47.200
 So we had a thoughtful conversation.

1:05:47.200 --> 1:05:48.760
 Unfortunately, it didn't work.

1:05:48.760 --> 1:05:50.880
 And I think that's where we are now.

1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:54.880
 So I absolutely think that there are real issues

1:05:54.880 --> 1:05:58.600
 with the relationship between the United States government

1:05:58.600 --> 1:06:01.600
 and EcoHealth Alliance, and through that,

1:06:01.600 --> 1:06:05.280
 the EcoHealth Alliance with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

1:06:05.280 --> 1:06:08.240
 And one issue is just essential transparency,

1:06:08.240 --> 1:06:10.960
 because as I see it, it's most likely the case

1:06:10.960 --> 1:06:14.440
 that we transferred a lot of our knowledge and plans and things

1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:16.640
 to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:22.120
 And again, I'm sure that Xiaojiang Li is not herself

1:06:22.120 --> 1:06:23.000
 a monster.

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:26.160
 I'm sure of that, even though I've never met her.

1:06:26.160 --> 1:06:29.080
 But there are just a different set of pressures

1:06:29.080 --> 1:06:31.360
 on people working in an authoritarian system

1:06:31.360 --> 1:06:33.360
 than people who are working in other systems.

1:06:33.360 --> 1:06:36.480
 That doesn't mean it's entirely different.

1:06:36.480 --> 1:06:40.640
 And so I absolutely think that we shouldn't give $1

1:06:40.640 --> 1:06:44.000
 to an organization, and certainly a virology institute,

1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:47.800
 where you don't have full access to their records,

1:06:47.800 --> 1:06:49.000
 to their databases.

1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:52.480
 We don't know what work is happening there.

1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:57.360
 And I think that we need to have that kind of full examination.

1:06:57.360 --> 1:07:01.440
 So I understand what Dr. Fauci is doing is saying,

1:07:01.440 --> 1:07:03.120
 hey, what I hear Dr. Fauci saying,

1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:05.160
 what I hear from you, Rand Paul, is

1:07:05.160 --> 1:07:08.760
 you're accusing me of starting this pandemic.

1:07:08.760 --> 1:07:11.400
 And you're using gain of function as a proxy for that.

1:07:11.400 --> 1:07:13.320
 And we have, when there are Senate hearings,

1:07:13.320 --> 1:07:15.280
 every senator gets five minutes.

1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:18.520
 And the name of the game is to translate your five minutes

1:07:18.520 --> 1:07:22.080
 into a clip that's going to run on the news.

1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:25.920
 And so I get that there is that kind of gotcha.

1:07:25.920 --> 1:07:31.720
 But I also think that Dr. Fauci and the National

1:07:31.720 --> 1:07:35.160
 Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the NIH

1:07:35.160 --> 1:07:37.080
 should have been more transparent.

1:07:37.080 --> 1:07:41.160
 Because I think that in this day and age, where

1:07:41.160 --> 1:07:42.880
 there are a lot of people poking around

1:07:42.880 --> 1:07:45.320
 and this whole story of COVID origins,

1:07:45.320 --> 1:07:47.720
 we would not be where we are if it

1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:51.080
 wasn't for a relatively small number of people.

1:07:51.080 --> 1:07:54.720
 And I'm part of, there are two, as I know, two groups.

1:07:54.720 --> 1:07:57.960
 One is these internet sleuths known as Drastic.

1:07:57.960 --> 1:08:00.520
 And a number of them are part of a group

1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:03.160
 that I'm part of called, it's not our official name,

1:08:03.160 --> 1:08:04.280
 but called the Paris Group.

1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:08.400
 It's about two dozen experts around the world,

1:08:08.400 --> 1:08:13.320
 but centered around some very high level French academics.

1:08:13.320 --> 1:08:16.600
 So we've all been digging and meeting with each other

1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:19.520
 regularly since last year.

1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:22.200
 And our governments across the board, certainly China,

1:08:22.200 --> 1:08:23.880
 but including the United States, haven't

1:08:23.880 --> 1:08:27.320
 been as transparent as they need to be.

1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:31.400
 So definitely mistakes were made on all sides.

1:08:31.400 --> 1:08:33.640
 And that's why for me from day one,

1:08:33.640 --> 1:08:37.040
 I've been calling for a comprehensive investigation

1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:40.760
 into this issue that certainly obviously looks at China,

1:08:40.760 --> 1:08:41.880
 but we have to look at ourselves.

1:08:41.880 --> 1:08:43.440
 We did not get this right.

1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:48.440
 So do you, I'm just gonna put Rand Paul aside here.

1:08:50.400 --> 1:08:53.280
 Politician playing political games, it's very frustrating,

1:08:53.280 --> 1:08:56.400
 but it is what it is on all sides.

1:08:56.400 --> 1:08:59.960
 Anthony Fauci, you think should have been more transparent

1:08:59.960 --> 1:09:04.960
 and maybe more eloquent in expressing the complexity

1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.760
 of all of this, the uncertainty in all of this.

1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:16.520
 Yeah, and I get that it's really hard to do that

1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:21.160
 because let's say you have one, you speak a paragraph

1:09:21.160 --> 1:09:23.120
 and it's got four sentences.

1:09:23.120 --> 1:09:25.720
 And one of those sentences is the thing

1:09:25.720 --> 1:09:27.080
 that's going to be turned into Twitter.

1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:28.280
 All right, let me put it back.

1:09:28.280 --> 1:09:32.480
 I get really, so I'll try not to be emotional about this,

1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:37.480
 but I've heard Anthony Fauci a couple of times now

1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:41.760
 say that he represents science.

1:09:43.680 --> 1:09:45.560
 I know what he means by that.

1:09:45.560 --> 1:09:48.920
 He means in this political bickering,

1:09:48.920 --> 1:09:52.120
 all that kind of stuff that for a lot of people,

1:09:52.120 --> 1:09:56.440
 he represents science, but words matter.

1:09:56.440 --> 1:09:58.600
 And this isn't just clips.

1:09:58.600 --> 1:10:00.400
 I mean, maybe I'm distinctly aware of that

1:10:00.400 --> 1:10:01.880
 doing this podcast.

1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:05.120
 Yeah, I talked for hundreds of hours now,

1:10:05.120 --> 1:10:07.200
 maybe over a thousand hours,

1:10:07.200 --> 1:10:11.520
 but I'm still careful with the words.

1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:13.160
 I'm trying not to be an asshole

1:10:13.160 --> 1:10:14.840
 and I'm aware when I'm an asshole

1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:16.240
 and I'll apologize for it.

1:10:17.640 --> 1:10:21.360
 If the words I represent science left my mouth,

1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:22.720
 which they very well could,

1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:26.040
 I would sure as hell be apologizing for it

1:10:26.040 --> 1:10:29.120
 and not because I got in trouble,

1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:31.480
 I would just feel bad about saying something like that.

1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:34.640
 And even that little phrase, I represent science.

1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:39.120
 No, Dr. Fauci, you do not represent science.

1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:42.480
 I love science, the millions of scientists

1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:45.160
 that inspired me to get into it.

1:10:45.160 --> 1:10:48.080
 To fall in love with the scientific method

1:10:48.080 --> 1:10:53.080
 in the exploration of ideas through the rigor of science,

1:10:53.080 --> 1:10:55.520
 that Anthony Fauci does not represent.

1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:59.880
 He's one, I believe, great scientist of millions.

1:10:59.880 --> 1:11:02.600
 He does not represent anybody.

1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:04.080
 He's just one scientist.

1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:07.160
 And I think the greatness of a scientist

1:11:07.160 --> 1:11:10.320
 is best exemplified in humility

1:11:10.320 --> 1:11:13.960
 because the scientific method basically says,

1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:18.960
 you're standing before the fog, the mystery of it all,

1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:22.640
 and slowly chipping away at the mystery.

1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:27.000
 And it's embarrassing, it's humiliating

1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.360
 how little you know, that's the experience.

1:11:29.360 --> 1:11:33.000
 So the great scientists have to have humility to me.

1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:34.880
 And especially in their communication,

1:11:34.880 --> 1:11:36.200
 they have to have humility.

1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:37.600
 And I mean, I don't know,

1:11:37.600 --> 1:11:39.560
 and some of it is also words matter

1:11:39.560 --> 1:11:44.560
 because great leaders have to have the poetry of action.

1:11:45.640 --> 1:11:49.640
 They have to be bold and inspire action

1:11:49.640 --> 1:11:52.720
 across millions of people.

1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:57.720
 But you also have to, through that poetry of words,

1:11:58.920 --> 1:12:02.800
 express the complexity of the uncertainty

1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:04.280
 you're operating under.

1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:06.680
 Be humble in the face of not being able

1:12:06.680 --> 1:12:09.640
 to predict the future or understand the past,

1:12:09.640 --> 1:12:11.600
 or really know what's the right thing to do,

1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:13.320
 but we have to do something.

1:12:13.320 --> 1:12:16.680
 And through that, you have to be a great leader

1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:17.960
 that inspires action.

1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:20.120
 And some of that is just words.

1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:22.000
 And he chose words poorly.

1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:25.440
 I mean, so I'm all torn about this.

1:12:25.440 --> 1:12:28.200
 And then there's politicians, they're taking those words

1:12:28.200 --> 1:12:31.680
 and magnifying them and playing games with them.

1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:34.360
 And of course, that's a disincentive

1:12:34.360 --> 1:12:37.760
 for the people who do, the scientific leaders

1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:41.640
 that step into the limelight to say any more words.

1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:43.520
 So they kind of become more conservative

1:12:43.520 --> 1:12:45.360
 with the words they use.

1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:47.080
 I mean, it just becomes a giant mess.

1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:52.080
 But I think the solution is to ignore all of that

1:12:52.320 --> 1:12:56.800
 and to be transparent, to be honest, to be vulnerable.

1:12:56.800 --> 1:13:01.600
 And to express the full uncertainty

1:13:01.600 --> 1:13:03.600
 of what you're operating under,

1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:05.880
 to present all the possible actions

1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:08.360
 and to be honest about the mistakes they made in the past.

1:13:08.360 --> 1:13:10.340
 I mean, there's something, even if you're not

1:13:10.340 --> 1:13:13.000
 directly responsible for those mistakes,

1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:18.000
 taking responsibility for them is a way to win people over.

1:13:18.020 --> 1:13:20.360
 I don't think leaders realize this often

1:13:20.360 --> 1:13:23.200
 in the modern age, in the internet age.

1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:24.920
 They can see through your bullshit.

1:13:24.920 --> 1:13:29.160
 And it's really inspiring when you take ownership.

1:13:29.160 --> 1:13:32.680
 So to do the thought experiment in public,

1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:35.320
 do a thought experiment if there was a lab leak

1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:38.960
 and then lay out all the funding, the EcoHealth Alliance,

1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:43.600
 all the incredible science going on at the Wuhan Institute

1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:45.380
 of Virology and the NIH.

1:13:46.380 --> 1:13:48.480
 Lay out all the possible ethical problems.

1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:53.480
 Lay out all the possible mistakes that could have been made

1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:56.160
 and say like, this could have happened.

1:13:56.160 --> 1:13:59.520
 And if this happened, here's the best way to respond to it

1:13:59.520 --> 1:14:00.880
 and to prevent it in the future.

1:14:00.880 --> 1:14:02.880
 And just lay all that complexity out.

1:14:02.880 --> 1:14:06.040
 I wish we would have seen that.

1:14:06.040 --> 1:14:09.400
 And I have hope that this conversation,

1:14:09.400 --> 1:14:11.800
 conversations like it, your work,

1:14:11.800 --> 1:14:15.840
 and books on this topic will inspire young people today

1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:18.600
 when they become in the Anthony Fauci's role

1:14:19.760 --> 1:14:22.200
 to be much more transparent and much more humble

1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:23.620
 and all those kinds of things.

1:14:23.620 --> 1:14:26.120
 That this is just a relic of the past

1:14:26.120 --> 1:14:28.000
 when there's a person, no offense to me,

1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.240
 in a suit that has to stand up and speak

1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:33.000
 with clarity and certainty.

1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:34.720
 I mean, that's just a relic of the past.

1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:39.360
 Is my hope.

1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:40.200
 But...

1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:41.040
 Do you mind if I...

1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:41.880
 Yeah, please.

1:14:41.880 --> 1:14:46.200
 I agree with a great deal of what you said.

1:14:46.200 --> 1:14:49.760
 And it's really unfortunate that our,

1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:51.840
 certainly the Chinese government, as I said before,

1:14:51.840 --> 1:14:55.540
 our government wasn't as transparent

1:14:55.540 --> 1:14:56.920
 as I feel they should have been,

1:14:56.920 --> 1:14:59.600
 particularly in the early days of the pandemic

1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:02.000
 and particularly with regard to the issue

1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:03.400
 of pandemic origins.

1:15:03.400 --> 1:15:06.760
 I mean, we know that Dr. Fauci was on calls

1:15:06.760 --> 1:15:10.680
 with people like Christian Anderson and Scripps and others

1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:13.440
 in those early days, raising questions.

1:15:13.440 --> 1:15:15.680
 Is this an engineered virus?

1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:17.480
 There were a lot of questions.

1:15:17.480 --> 1:15:19.560
 And it's kind of sad.

1:15:19.560 --> 1:15:23.520
 I mean, as I mentioned before, I've been one,

1:15:23.520 --> 1:15:25.640
 I mean, and certainly there were others,

1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:27.740
 but there weren't a lot of us,

1:15:27.740 --> 1:15:30.800
 of the people who from the earliest days of the pandemic

1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:34.960
 were raising questions about, hey, not so fast here.

1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:38.560
 And I launched my website on pandemic origins

1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:41.160
 in April of last year, April, 2020.

1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:42.580
 It got a huge amount of attention.

1:15:42.580 --> 1:15:44.960
 And actually my friend, Matt Pottinger,

1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:46.880
 who is the deputy national security advisor,

1:15:46.880 --> 1:15:50.440
 when he was reaching out to people in the US government

1:15:50.440 --> 1:15:51.840
 and in allied government saying,

1:15:51.840 --> 1:15:54.360
 hey, we should look into this,

1:15:54.360 --> 1:15:56.760
 what he was sending them was my website.

1:15:56.760 --> 1:16:00.240
 It wasn't some US government information.

1:16:00.240 --> 1:16:02.720
 And by the way, people should still go to the website.

1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:07.360
 You keep updating it and it's an incredible resource.

1:16:07.360 --> 1:16:09.360
 Thank you, thank you, jamiemetzel.com.

1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:13.440
 And it's really unfortunate that our governments

1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:18.320
 and international institutions for pretty much all of 2020

1:16:18.320 --> 1:16:22.520
 weren't doing their jobs of really probing this issue.

1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:26.520
 People were hiding behind this kind of false consensus.

1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:28.480
 And I'm critical of many people,

1:16:28.480 --> 1:16:32.440
 even when I heard Francis Collins interview with you,

1:16:32.440 --> 1:16:35.280
 I just felt, well, he wasn't as balanced

1:16:35.280 --> 1:16:37.400
 on the issue of COVID origins.

1:16:37.400 --> 1:16:41.480
 Certainly Dr. Fauci could have in his conversation

1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:43.380
 with Rand Paul, it wasn't even a conversation,

1:16:43.380 --> 1:16:46.600
 but in some process in the aftermath,

1:16:46.600 --> 1:16:48.280
 could have laid things out a bit better.

1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:50.880
 He did say, and Francis Collins did say

1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:53.360
 that we don't know the origins and that was a shift

1:16:54.320 --> 1:16:56.120
 and we need to have an investigation.

1:16:56.120 --> 1:17:00.600
 So now, but having said all of that,

1:17:00.600 --> 1:17:04.940
 I do kind of one, I have tremendous respect for Dr. Fauci

1:17:04.940 --> 1:17:06.880
 for the work that he's done on HIV AIDS.

1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:10.920
 I mean, I have been vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine.

1:17:10.920 --> 1:17:14.000
 Dr. Fauci was a big part of the story

1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:15.640
 of getting us these vaccines

1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:19.440
 that have saved millions and millions of lives.

1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:23.200
 And so I don't think, I mean, there's a lot to this story.

1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:26.480
 And then the second thing is it's really hard

1:17:26.480 --> 1:17:28.440
 to be a public health expert

1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:32.120
 because you have your mission is public health.

1:17:32.120 --> 1:17:35.100
 And so, and you have to, if you are leading

1:17:35.100 --> 1:17:37.800
 with all of your uncertainty,

1:17:37.800 --> 1:17:40.480
 it's a really hard way to do things.

1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:43.680
 And so like, even now, like if I go to CVS

1:17:43.680 --> 1:17:47.960
 and I get a Tylenol, somebody has done a calculation

1:17:47.960 --> 1:17:51.520
 of how many people will die from taking Tylenol

1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:54.040
 and they say, well, all right, we can live with that.

1:17:54.040 --> 1:17:55.960
 And that's why we have regulation.

1:17:55.960 --> 1:17:59.120
 And so all of us are doing kind of summaries.

1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:00.920
 And then we have people in public health who are saying,

1:18:00.920 --> 1:18:04.880
 wow, we've summed it all up and you should do X.

1:18:04.880 --> 1:18:09.480
 You should get your kids vaccinated for measles.

1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:12.920
 You should not drive your car at a hundred miles an hour.

1:18:12.920 --> 1:18:15.240
 You should, don't drink lighter fluid,

1:18:15.240 --> 1:18:17.360
 whatever these things are.

1:18:17.360 --> 1:18:20.960
 And we want them to kind of give us broad guidelines.

1:18:20.960 --> 1:18:25.200
 And yet now our information world is so fragmented

1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:29.760
 that if you're not being honest about something,

1:18:29.760 --> 1:18:33.220
 something material, someone's going to find out

1:18:33.220 --> 1:18:35.000
 and it's going to undermine your credibility.

1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:40.000
 And so I agree with you that there's a greater requirement

1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:43.400
 for transparency now.

1:18:43.400 --> 1:18:44.480
 Maybe there always has been,

1:18:44.480 --> 1:18:48.520
 but there's an even greater requirement for it now

1:18:48.520 --> 1:18:53.520
 because people want to trust that you're speaking honestly

1:18:53.640 --> 1:18:56.040
 and that you're saying, well, here's what I know.

1:18:56.040 --> 1:18:58.080
 And this is based on what I know,

1:18:58.080 --> 1:19:00.520
 here are the conclusions that I draw.

1:19:00.520 --> 1:19:03.440
 But if it's just, and again, I don't think the words,

1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:06.920
 I'm science or whatever it was are the right words.

1:19:06.920 --> 1:19:10.840
 But if it's just, trust me because of who I am,

1:19:10.840 --> 1:19:13.540
 I don't think that flies anywhere anymore.

1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:18.040
 Can I just ask you about the Francis Collins interview

1:19:18.040 --> 1:19:20.000
 that I did, if you got a chance to hear that part.

1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:22.600
 I think in the beginning we talk about the lab leak.

1:19:23.720 --> 1:19:25.880
 What are your thoughts about his response,

1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:28.800
 basically saying it's worthy of an investigation,

1:19:28.800 --> 1:19:33.480
 but I mean, I don't know how you would interpret it.

1:19:33.480 --> 1:19:38.480
 I see, it's funny because I heard it in the moment

1:19:39.640 --> 1:19:44.360
 as it's great for the head of NIH

1:19:44.360 --> 1:19:46.800
 to be open minded on this.

1:19:46.800 --> 1:19:51.040
 But then the internet and Mr. Joe Rogan

1:19:51.040 --> 1:19:55.040
 and a bunch of friends and colleagues told me that,

1:19:55.040 --> 1:19:58.640
 yeah, well, that's too late and too little.

1:19:58.640 --> 1:20:03.240
 Yeah, so first let me say, I've been on Joe's podcast twice

1:20:03.240 --> 1:20:06.380
 and I love the guy, which doesn't mean that I agree

1:20:06.380 --> 1:20:09.300
 with everything he does or says.

1:20:10.200 --> 1:20:13.800
 And on this issue, and I'm normally a pretty calm

1:20:13.800 --> 1:20:17.160
 and measured guy, and when you're just out running

1:20:17.160 --> 1:20:21.120
 with your AirPods on and you start yelling

1:20:21.120 --> 1:20:23.960
 into the wind in Central Park,

1:20:23.960 --> 1:20:27.600
 nobody else knows why you're yelling, but well.

1:20:27.600 --> 1:20:28.960
 So that you had such a moment?

1:20:28.960 --> 1:20:30.600
 I had a moment with Collins.

1:20:30.600 --> 1:20:34.040
 And again, Francis Collins is someone I respect enormously.

1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:38.480
 I mean, I live a big chunk of my life living in the world

1:20:38.480 --> 1:20:42.480
 of genetics and biotech and my book, Hacking Darwin

1:20:42.480 --> 1:20:45.160
 is about the future of human genetic engineering

1:20:45.160 --> 1:20:47.200
 and his work on the Human Genome Project

1:20:47.200 --> 1:20:49.240
 and so many other things have been fantastic.

1:20:49.240 --> 1:20:53.320
 And I'm a huge fan of the work of NIH.

1:20:53.320 --> 1:20:56.080
 And he was right to say that the Chinese government

1:20:56.080 --> 1:20:58.720
 hasn't been forthcoming and we need to look into it.

1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:01.920
 But then you asked him, well, how will we know?

1:21:01.920 --> 1:21:03.700
 And then his answer was,

1:21:03.700 --> 1:21:06.120
 we need to find the intermediate host.

1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:09.240
 Remember I said before, and so that made it clear

1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:13.080
 that he thought, well, we should have an investigation,

1:21:13.080 --> 1:21:16.480
 but it comes from nature and we just need to find

1:21:16.480 --> 1:21:20.240
 that whatever it is, that intermediate animal host

1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:22.480
 in the wild, and that'll tell us the story.

1:21:22.480 --> 1:21:25.640
 So he already had the conclusion in mind

1:21:25.640 --> 1:21:27.320
 and they're just waiting for the evidence

1:21:27.320 --> 1:21:28.400
 to support the conclusion.

1:21:28.400 --> 1:21:29.680
 That was my feeling.

1:21:29.680 --> 1:21:33.200
 I felt like he was open in general, but he was tilting.

1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:36.480
 And again, your first question was where do I fall?

1:21:36.480 --> 1:21:41.480
 He was like, I'm 85% or whatever it is, 80, 75, 90,

1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:45.000
 whatever it is in the direction of a lab incident.

1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:49.720
 It made it feel that he was 90, 10 in the other direction,

1:21:49.720 --> 1:21:52.320
 which is still means that he's open minded

1:21:52.320 --> 1:21:54.000
 about the possibility.

1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:58.000
 And that's why, in my view, every single person

1:21:58.000 --> 1:21:59.520
 who talks about this issue,

1:21:59.520 --> 1:22:02.560
 I think the right answer in my view is,

1:22:02.560 --> 1:22:04.080
 we don't know conclusively.

1:22:04.080 --> 1:22:06.040
 In my, then this is my personal view,

1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:08.760
 the circumstantial evidence is strongly in favor

1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:10.120
 of a lab incident origin,

1:22:10.120 --> 1:22:11.760
 but that could immediately shift

1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:13.920
 with additional information.

1:22:13.920 --> 1:22:18.760
 We need transparency, but we should come together

1:22:18.760 --> 1:22:23.400
 in absolutely condemning the outrageous coverup

1:22:23.400 --> 1:22:25.360
 carried out by the Chinese government,

1:22:25.360 --> 1:22:30.360
 which to this day is preventing any meaningful investigation

1:22:30.640 --> 1:22:31.760
 into pandemic origins.

1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:35.400
 We have, if you use the economist numbers,

1:22:35.400 --> 1:22:39.920
 15 million people who are dead as a result of this pandemic.

1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:43.600
 And I believe that the actions of the Chinese government

1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:49.600
 are disgracing the memory of these 15 million dead.

1:22:50.160 --> 1:22:54.840
 They're insulting the families and the billions of people

1:22:54.840 --> 1:22:56.480
 around the world who have suffered

1:22:56.480 --> 1:23:00.000
 from this totally avoidable pandemic.

1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:03.800
 And whatever the origin, the fact the criminal coverup

1:23:03.800 --> 1:23:06.480
 carried out by the Chinese government,

1:23:06.480 --> 1:23:09.080
 which continues to this day, but most intensely

1:23:09.080 --> 1:23:11.640
 in the first months following the outbreak,

1:23:11.640 --> 1:23:16.320
 that's the reason why we have so many dead.

1:23:16.320 --> 1:23:18.640
 And certainly, as I was saying before,

1:23:18.640 --> 1:23:22.480
 I and a small number of others have been carrying this flame

1:23:22.480 --> 1:23:26.560
 since early last year, but it's kind of crazy

1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:29.320
 that our governments haven't been demanding it.

1:23:29.320 --> 1:23:33.080
 And we can talk about the World Health Organization process,

1:23:33.080 --> 1:23:35.560
 which was deeply compromised in the beginning.

1:23:35.560 --> 1:23:38.440
 Now it's become much, much better.

1:23:38.440 --> 1:23:42.520
 But again, it was the pressure of outsiders

1:23:42.520 --> 1:23:44.960
 that played such an important role in shifting

1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:48.840
 our national and international institutions.

1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:50.400
 And while that's better than nothing,

1:23:50.400 --> 1:23:53.320
 it would have been far better if our governments

1:23:53.320 --> 1:23:55.000
 and international organizations

1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:56.400
 had done the right thing from the start.

1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:01.400
 If I could just make a couple of comments about Joe Rogan.

1:24:04.920 --> 1:24:08.600
 So there's a bunch of people in my life

1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:11.720
 who have inspired me, who have taught me a lot,

1:24:11.720 --> 1:24:16.720
 who I even look up to, many of them are alive,

1:24:17.240 --> 1:24:19.000
 most of them are dead.

1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:22.640
 I wanna say that Joe said a few critical words

1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:24.680
 about the conversation with Francis Collins,

1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:28.720
 most of it offline, with a lot of great conversations

1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:32.680
 about it, some he said publicly.

1:24:32.680 --> 1:24:37.680
 And he was also critical to say that me asking hard questions

1:24:45.200 --> 1:24:47.360
 in an interview is not my strong suit.

1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:53.240
 And I really want to kind of respond to that,

1:24:53.240 --> 1:24:56.720
 which I did privately as well, but publicly,

1:24:56.720 --> 1:25:01.280
 to say that Joe is 100% right on that.

1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:04.560
 But that doesn't mean that always has to be the case.

1:25:04.560 --> 1:25:06.680
 And that is definitely something I wanna work on.

1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:08.760
 Because most of the conversations I have,

1:25:08.760 --> 1:25:12.280
 I wanna see the beautiful ideas in people's minds.

1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:15.920
 But there's some times where you have to ask

1:25:15.920 --> 1:25:19.680
 the hard questions to bring out the beautiful ideas.

1:25:20.640 --> 1:25:23.000
 And it's hard to do.

1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:24.040
 It's a skill.

1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:26.480
 And Joe is very good at this.

1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:29.880
 He says the way he put it in his criticisms,

1:25:29.880 --> 1:25:31.640
 and he does this in his conversations,

1:25:31.640 --> 1:25:34.760
 which is, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1:25:34.760 --> 1:25:36.520
 There's a kind of sense like,

1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:38.640
 did you just say what you said?

1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:42.520
 Let's make sure we get to the bottom,

1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:44.320
 we'll clarify what you mean.

1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:49.320
 Because sometimes really big negative or difficult ideas

1:25:54.840 --> 1:25:59.080
 can be said as a quick aside in a sentence,

1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:02.720
 like it's nothing, but it could be everything.

1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:04.600
 And you wanna make sure you catch that

1:26:04.600 --> 1:26:06.360
 and you talk about it.

1:26:06.360 --> 1:26:10.760
 And not as a gotcha, not as a kinda way

1:26:10.760 --> 1:26:12.400
 to destroy another human being,

1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:14.840
 but to reveal something profound.

1:26:14.840 --> 1:26:16.960
 And that's definitely something I wanna work on.

1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:21.960
 I also want to say that, as you said,

1:26:22.160 --> 1:26:24.480
 you disagree with Joe on quite a lot of things.

1:26:24.480 --> 1:26:26.480
 So for a long time, Joe was somebody

1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:28.080
 that I was just a fan of and listened to.

1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:30.920
 He's now a good friend.

1:26:30.920 --> 1:26:34.560
 And I would say we disagree more than we agree.

1:26:34.560 --> 1:26:36.520
 And I love doing that.

1:26:38.160 --> 1:26:41.680
 But at the same time, I learned from that.

1:26:41.680 --> 1:26:46.560
 So it's like dual, like nobody in this world

1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:48.720
 can tell me what to think.

1:26:48.720 --> 1:26:53.720
 But I think everybody has a lesson to teach me.

1:26:54.240 --> 1:26:57.080
 I think that's a good way to approach it.

1:26:57.080 --> 1:27:00.320
 Whenever somebody has words of criticism,

1:27:00.320 --> 1:27:04.320
 I assume they're right and walk around with that idea

1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:07.360
 to really sort of empathize with that idea

1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:09.120
 because there's a lesson there.

1:27:09.120 --> 1:27:14.120
 And oftentimes, my understanding of a topic

1:27:18.400 --> 1:27:22.480
 is altered completely or it becomes much more nuanced

1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:27.160
 or much richer for that kind of empathetic process.

1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:31.440
 But definitely, I do not allow anybody

1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:35.040
 to tell me what to think, whether it's Joe Rogan

1:27:35.040 --> 1:27:39.120
 or Fyodor Dostoevsky or Nietzsche or my parents

1:27:39.120 --> 1:27:44.120
 or the proverbial girlfriend, which I don't actually have.

1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:49.880
 But she's still busting my balls.

1:27:49.880 --> 1:27:51.280
 Exactly, exactly.

1:27:51.280 --> 1:27:54.120
 In my imagination, I have a girlfriend in Canada

1:27:55.000 --> 1:28:00.000
 that I have imagined, exactly, imagining conversations.

1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:01.440
 So I want to mention that.

1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:04.000
 But also, I don't know if you've gotten a chance

1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:06.360
 to see this, but I'd love to also mention

1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:11.360
 this Twitter feud between two other interesting people,

1:28:12.760 --> 1:28:15.800
 which is Brett Weinstein and Sam Harris

1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:18.480
 or Sam Harris and others in general.

1:28:18.480 --> 1:28:22.120
 And it kind of breaks my heart that these two people

1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:25.560
 I listen to that are very thoughtful about a bunch of issues.

1:28:25.560 --> 1:28:29.160
 Let's put COVID aside because people are very emotional

1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:30.520
 about this topic.

1:28:30.520 --> 1:28:35.520
 I mean, I think they're deeply thoughtful and intelligent,

1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:39.040
 whether you agree with them or not.

1:28:39.040 --> 1:28:42.080
 And I always learn something from their conversations.

1:28:42.080 --> 1:28:44.480
 And they are legitimately or have been

1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:46.560
 for a long time friends.

1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:49.400
 And it's a little bit heartbreaking to me

1:28:49.400 --> 1:28:53.320
 to see that they basically don't talk in private anymore.

1:28:53.320 --> 1:28:57.080
 And there's occasional jabs on Twitter.

1:28:57.080 --> 1:29:00.080
 And I hope that changes.

1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:02.240
 I hope that changes in general for COVID,

1:29:02.240 --> 1:29:06.120
 that COVID brought out the, I would say,

1:29:06.120 --> 1:29:10.080
 the most emotional sides of people, the worst in people.

1:29:10.080 --> 1:29:14.280
 And I think there hasn't been enough love

1:29:14.280 --> 1:29:16.600
 and empathy and compassion.

1:29:16.600 --> 1:29:20.720
 And to see two people from whom I've learned a lot,

1:29:20.720 --> 1:29:23.720
 whether it's Eric Weinstein, Brett Weinstein, Sam Harris,

1:29:23.720 --> 1:29:25.520
 you can criticize them as much as you want,

1:29:25.520 --> 1:29:27.360
 their ideas as much as you want.

1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:30.240
 But if you're not sufficiently open minded

1:29:31.160 --> 1:29:33.080
 to admit that you have a lot to learn

1:29:33.080 --> 1:29:37.720
 from their conversations, I think you're not being honest.

1:29:37.720 --> 1:29:40.520
 And so I do hope they have those conversations.

1:29:40.520 --> 1:29:42.040
 And I hope we can kind of,

1:29:42.040 --> 1:29:44.920
 I think there's a lot of repairing to be done post COVID

1:29:45.840 --> 1:29:49.600
 of relationships, of conversations.

1:29:49.600 --> 1:29:53.880
 And I think empathy and love can help a lot there.

1:29:53.880 --> 1:29:58.480
 This is also just a, I talked to Sam privately,

1:29:58.480 --> 1:30:01.040
 but this is also a public call out

1:30:01.040 --> 1:30:06.040
 to put a little bit more love in the world.

1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:13.000
 And for these difficult conversations to happen.

1:30:14.160 --> 1:30:19.160
 Because Brett Weinstein could be very wrong

1:30:19.160 --> 1:30:24.160
 about a bunch of topics here around COVID,

1:30:25.480 --> 1:30:27.440
 but he could also be right.

1:30:27.440 --> 1:30:29.080
 And the only way to find out

1:30:29.080 --> 1:30:31.200
 is to have those conversations.

1:30:31.200 --> 1:30:32.760
 Because there's a lot of people listening

1:30:32.760 --> 1:30:35.480
 to both Sam Harris and Brett Weinstein.

1:30:35.480 --> 1:30:39.520
 And if you go into these silos

1:30:39.520 --> 1:30:42.120
 where you just keep telling each other

1:30:44.960 --> 1:30:46.680
 that you are the possessors of truth

1:30:46.680 --> 1:30:48.800
 and nobody else is the possessor of truth,

1:30:48.800 --> 1:30:53.520
 what starts happening is you both lose track

1:30:53.520 --> 1:30:56.080
 or the capability of arriving at the truth.

1:30:56.080 --> 1:30:58.440
 Because nobody's in the possession of the truth.

1:30:58.440 --> 1:30:59.920
 So anyway, this is just a call out

1:30:59.920 --> 1:31:01.560
 that we should have a little bit more conversation,

1:31:01.560 --> 1:31:02.400
 a little bit more love.

1:31:02.400 --> 1:31:04.240
 I totally agree.

1:31:04.240 --> 1:31:08.000
 And both of those guys are guys who I respect.

1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:11.560
 And as you know, Brett, and again, as I mentioned,

1:31:11.560 --> 1:31:13.760
 they're just a handful of us,

1:31:13.760 --> 1:31:16.320
 who were the early people raising questions

1:31:16.320 --> 1:31:17.640
 about the origins of this.

1:31:17.640 --> 1:31:19.520
 Of this pandemic, right.

1:31:19.520 --> 1:31:21.160
 He was there also talking.

1:31:21.160 --> 1:31:24.000
 So people have heard him speak quite a bit

1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:26.920
 about any viral drugs and all that kind of stuff.

1:31:26.920 --> 1:31:30.600
 But he was also raising concerns about lab leak early on.

1:31:30.600 --> 1:31:31.440
 Yeah, exactly.

1:31:31.440 --> 1:31:33.680
 And so, but I completely agree with you

1:31:33.680 --> 1:31:37.440
 that we don't have to agree with everybody,

1:31:37.440 --> 1:31:40.720
 but it's great to have healthy conversations.

1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:42.120
 That's how we grow.

1:31:42.120 --> 1:31:46.680
 And absolutely, we live in a world where we're kind of,

1:31:46.680 --> 1:31:47.680
 if we're not careful,

1:31:47.680 --> 1:31:49.840
 pushed into these little information pockets.

1:31:49.840 --> 1:31:51.720
 And certainly on social media,

1:31:51.720 --> 1:31:53.960
 I have different parts of my life.

1:31:53.960 --> 1:31:58.560
 One is focusing on issues of COVID origins.

1:31:58.560 --> 1:32:00.920
 And then I have genetics and biotechnology.

1:32:00.920 --> 1:32:02.960
 And then I have, which maybe we'll talk about later,

1:32:02.960 --> 1:32:04.200
 one shared world, which is about

1:32:04.200 --> 1:32:06.680
 how do we build a safer future?

1:32:06.680 --> 1:32:10.320
 And when I say critical things like the Chinese government,

1:32:10.320 --> 1:32:12.880
 we'd have to demand a full investigation

1:32:12.880 --> 1:32:14.120
 into pandemic origins.

1:32:14.120 --> 1:32:15.080
 This is an outreach.

1:32:15.080 --> 1:32:16.640
 Then it's really popular.

1:32:16.640 --> 1:32:19.000
 When I say, let's build a better future

1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:20.520
 for everyone in peace and love,

1:32:20.520 --> 1:32:22.920
 it's like, wow, three people liked it.

1:32:22.920 --> 1:32:24.960
 And one was my mother.

1:32:24.960 --> 1:32:27.960
 And so I just feel like we need to build,

1:32:27.960 --> 1:32:32.000
 we used to have that connectivity just built in

1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:33.960
 because we had these town squares

1:32:33.960 --> 1:32:35.960
 and you couldn't get away from them.

1:32:35.960 --> 1:32:37.640
 Now we can get away from them.

1:32:37.640 --> 1:32:41.120
 So engaging with people who are of a different background

1:32:41.120 --> 1:32:42.400
 is really essential.

1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:47.400
 I'm on Fox News sometimes three, four times a week.

1:32:47.960 --> 1:32:49.640
 And I wouldn't, in my normal life,

1:32:49.640 --> 1:32:53.440
 I'm not watching that much of Fox News

1:32:53.440 --> 1:32:56.120
 or even television more generally.

1:32:56.120 --> 1:32:58.840
 But I just feel like if I just speak to people

1:32:58.840 --> 1:33:03.000
 who are very similar to me, maybe it'll be comfortable.

1:33:03.840 --> 1:33:05.640
 But what have I contributed?

1:33:05.640 --> 1:33:07.600
 So I think we really have to have

1:33:07.600 --> 1:33:11.640
 those kinds of conversations and recognize

1:33:11.640 --> 1:33:15.800
 that at the end of the day, most people want to be happy.

1:33:15.800 --> 1:33:17.280
 They want to live in a better world.

1:33:17.280 --> 1:33:20.160
 They maybe have different paths to get there.

1:33:20.160 --> 1:33:22.600
 But if we just break into camps

1:33:22.600 --> 1:33:24.680
 that don't even connect with each other,

1:33:24.680 --> 1:33:26.520
 that's a much more dangerous world.

1:33:28.920 --> 1:33:31.440
 Let's dive back into the difficult pool.

1:33:32.680 --> 1:33:36.800
 Just like you said, in the English speaking world,

1:33:36.800 --> 1:33:41.800
 it seems popular, almost easy to demonize China.

1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:45.720
 The Chinese government, I should say.

1:33:46.920 --> 1:33:50.160
 But even China, like there's this kind of gray area

1:33:50.160 --> 1:33:52.320
 that people just fall into.

1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:54.920
 And I'm really uncomfortable with that.

1:33:54.920 --> 1:33:58.480
 Perhaps because in my mind, in my heart, in my blood

1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:01.120
 are echoes of the Cold War and that kind of tension.

1:34:01.120 --> 1:34:06.120
 But it feels like we almost desire conflict.

1:34:09.160 --> 1:34:12.040
 So we see demons when there is none.

1:34:12.040 --> 1:34:15.680
 So I'm a little cautious to demonize.

1:34:15.680 --> 1:34:18.120
 But at the same time, you have to be honest.

1:34:18.120 --> 1:34:22.320
 So it's like honest with the demons that are there

1:34:22.320 --> 1:34:23.760
 and honest when they're not.

1:34:25.360 --> 1:34:29.280
 This is kind of a geopolitical therapy session of sorts.

1:34:29.280 --> 1:34:31.760
 So let's keep talking about China

1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:33.000
 a little bit from different angles.

1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:37.840
 So let's return to the director of the Center

1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:39.240
 of Emerging Infectious Disease

1:34:39.240 --> 1:34:42.400
 at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Xi Zhengli,

1:34:44.120 --> 1:34:46.000
 colloquially referred to as Batwoman.

1:34:47.520 --> 1:34:51.440
 So do you think she's lying?

1:34:51.440 --> 1:34:52.280
 Yes.

1:34:52.280 --> 1:34:54.720
 Do you think she's being forced to lie?

1:34:54.720 --> 1:34:55.560
 Yes.

1:34:55.560 --> 1:34:58.240
 I've known a bunch of virologists

1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:00.200
 in private and public conversation

1:35:00.200 --> 1:35:03.520
 that respect her as a human being, as a scientist.

1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:05.080
 I respect her as a human being.

1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:07.080
 Sorry, as a scientist, not a human being.

1:35:07.080 --> 1:35:08.640
 Because I think they don't know the human.

1:35:08.640 --> 1:35:09.520
 They know the scientists.

1:35:09.520 --> 1:35:11.360
 And they respect her a lot as a scientist.

1:35:11.360 --> 1:35:12.720
 Yeah, I respect her.

1:35:12.720 --> 1:35:13.960
 I've never met her.

1:35:13.960 --> 1:35:16.160
 We had one exchange, which I'll mention in a second

1:35:16.160 --> 1:35:17.640
 in a virtual forum.

1:35:17.640 --> 1:35:18.800
 But I do respect her.

1:35:18.800 --> 1:35:20.560
 I actually think that she is somebody

1:35:20.560 --> 1:35:23.120
 who has tried to do the right thing.

1:35:23.120 --> 1:35:25.240
 She was one of the heroes of tracking down

1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:27.440
 the origins of SARS 1.

1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:29.920
 And that was a major contribution.

1:35:31.160 --> 1:35:34.120
 But as we talked about earlier,

1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:38.520
 it's a different thing living, being a scientist,

1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:40.640
 or really kind of anything.

1:35:40.640 --> 1:35:43.960
 It's different being one of those people

1:35:43.960 --> 1:35:47.240
 in an authoritarian society

1:35:47.240 --> 1:35:50.520
 than it is being in a different type of society.

1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:54.200
 And so when Xi Zhengli said that the reason

1:35:54.200 --> 1:35:59.200
 the WIV database was taken offline in September 19

1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:02.280
 was because of computer hacks,

1:36:02.280 --> 1:36:03.960
 I don't think that's the story.

1:36:03.960 --> 1:36:07.560
 I don't think she thinks that's the story.

1:36:07.560 --> 1:36:12.560
 When I asked her in March of 2021, March of this year,

1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:15.480
 in a Rutgers online forum,

1:36:15.480 --> 1:36:18.280
 when I asked her whether the Chinese military

1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:22.200
 had any engagement with the Wuhan Institute of Virology

1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:26.480
 in any way, and she said, absolutely not, paraphrasing,

1:36:26.480 --> 1:36:27.720
 I think she was lying.

1:36:27.720 --> 1:36:30.720
 Do I think that she had the ability to say,

1:36:30.720 --> 1:36:34.440
 well, either one, yes, but I can't talk about it,

1:36:34.440 --> 1:36:36.560
 or I know there are a lot of things

1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:38.160
 that are happening at this institute

1:36:38.160 --> 1:36:42.080
 that I don't know about, and that could be one.

1:36:42.080 --> 1:36:46.440
 Could she have said that the personnel

1:36:46.440 --> 1:36:48.160
 at the Wuhan Institute of Virology

1:36:48.160 --> 1:36:52.880
 have all had to go through classification training

1:36:52.880 --> 1:36:57.600
 so that they can know about what can and can't be said?

1:36:57.600 --> 1:36:59.520
 Like she could have said all those things,

1:36:59.520 --> 1:37:01.920
 but she couldn't say all of those things.

1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:06.920
 And I think that's why so many, at least in my view,

1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:11.080
 so many people certainly in the Western world

1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:13.600
 got this story wrong from the beginning,

1:37:13.600 --> 1:37:17.640
 because if your only prism was the science,

1:37:17.640 --> 1:37:20.680
 and you just assumed this is a science question

1:37:20.680 --> 1:37:22.680
 to be left to the scientists,

1:37:22.680 --> 1:37:26.000
 should Zhengli is just like any scientist

1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:29.280
 working in Switzerland or Norway,

1:37:29.280 --> 1:37:33.360
 the Chinese government isn't interfering in any way,

1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:37.280
 and we can trust them, that would lead you down one path.

1:37:37.280 --> 1:37:40.680
 In my view, the reason why I progressed as I did

1:37:40.680 --> 1:37:42.280
 is I felt like I had two keys,

1:37:42.280 --> 1:37:45.960
 and I had one key as I live in the science world

1:37:45.960 --> 1:37:50.120
 through my work with WHO and my books and things like that.

1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:52.280
 But I also have another part of my life

1:37:52.280 --> 1:37:57.280
 in the world of geopolitics as an Asia quote unquote expert

1:37:57.680 --> 1:38:00.400
 and former National Security Council official

1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:01.240
 and other things.

1:38:01.240 --> 1:38:06.240
 And I felt for me, I needed both keys to open that door.

1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:08.960
 But if I only had the science key,

1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:11.960
 I wouldn't have had the level of doubt and suspicion

1:38:11.960 --> 1:38:12.920
 that I have.

1:38:12.920 --> 1:38:16.000
 But if my starting point was only doubt and suspicion,

1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:17.520
 well, it's coming from China,

1:38:17.520 --> 1:38:20.600
 it must be that the government is guilty,

1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:22.200
 like that wouldn't help either.

1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:26.600
 I wonder what's in her mind,

1:38:26.600 --> 1:38:29.840
 whether it's fear or habit,

1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:35.760
 because I think a lot of people in the former Soviet Union,

1:38:35.760 --> 1:38:38.720
 it's like Chernobyl, it's not really fear,

1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:40.600
 it's almost like a momentum.

1:38:40.600 --> 1:38:45.200
 It's like the reason I showed up to this interview

1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:48.000
 wearing clothes, as opposed to being naked.

1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:49.360
 It's like, all right.

1:38:51.120 --> 1:38:55.760
 It's like, it's just all of us are doing the clothes thing.

1:38:55.760 --> 1:38:59.600
 Although there was a startup years ago called Naked News.

1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:00.440
 Did you ever hear about that?

1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:02.520
 They just would read the exact news.

1:39:02.520 --> 1:39:03.360
 With naked.

1:39:03.360 --> 1:39:06.160
 No, after each story, they'd take something off

1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:08.120
 until the end, I don't think.

1:39:08.120 --> 1:39:09.600
 It's a good idea for a podcast.

1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:10.640
 They have an IPO.

1:39:10.640 --> 1:39:13.560
 Stay tuned, next time I'm with Michael Miles.

1:39:13.560 --> 1:39:14.400
 Yeah.

1:39:14.400 --> 1:39:15.240
 Okay.

1:39:16.960 --> 1:39:18.480
 So what do you think,

1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:21.080
 I mean, because the reason I asked that question is,

1:39:22.360 --> 1:39:25.680
 how do we kind of take steps to improve

1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:27.960
 without any kind of revolutionary action?

1:39:27.960 --> 1:39:32.760
 You could say, we need to inspire the Chinese people

1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:37.760
 to elect, to sort of revolutionize the system

1:39:37.760 --> 1:39:42.760
 from within, but like, who are we to suggest that?

1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:44.760
 Because we have our flaws too.

1:39:44.760 --> 1:39:47.320
 We should be working on our flaws as well.

1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:51.760
 And so, but at the individual scientist level,

1:39:51.760 --> 1:39:55.720
 what are the small acts of rebellion that could be done?

1:39:55.720 --> 1:39:57.960
 How can we improve this?

1:39:57.960 --> 1:40:01.760
 Well, so I don't know about small acts of rebellion,

1:40:01.760 --> 1:40:03.920
 but I'll try to answer your question

1:40:03.920 --> 1:40:07.800
 from a few different perspectives.

1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:10.920
 So right now, actually, as we speak,

1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:12.840
 there is a special session

1:40:12.840 --> 1:40:14.600
 of the World Health Assembly going on.

1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:17.440
 And the World Health Assembly is the governing authority

1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:19.240
 over the World Health Organization,

1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:22.440
 where it's represented by states and territories,

1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:26.800
 194 of them, tragically not including Taiwan,

1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:29.160
 because of the Chinese government's assistance.

1:40:29.160 --> 1:40:31.360
 But they're now beginning a process

1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:35.320
 of trying to negotiate a global pandemic treaty

1:40:35.320 --> 1:40:37.480
 to try to have a better process

1:40:37.480 --> 1:40:42.040
 for responding to crises exactly like we're in.

1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:45.440
 But unfortunately, for the exact same reasons

1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:48.680
 that we have failed, I mean, we had a similar process

1:40:48.680 --> 1:40:50.880
 after the first SARS, we set up what we thought

1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:52.480
 was the best available system,

1:40:52.480 --> 1:40:55.280
 and it has totally failed here.

1:40:55.280 --> 1:41:00.280
 And it's failed here because of the inherent pathologies

1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:02.760
 of the Chinese government system.

1:41:02.760 --> 1:41:06.600
 We are suffering from a pandemic that exists

1:41:06.600 --> 1:41:11.200
 because of the internal pathologies of the Chinese state.

1:41:11.200 --> 1:41:14.720
 And that's why on one hand, I totally get this impulse.

1:41:14.720 --> 1:41:17.760
 Well, we do it our way, they do it their way.

1:41:17.760 --> 1:41:20.920
 Who's to say that one way is better?

1:41:20.920 --> 1:41:23.320
 And certainly right now in the United States,

1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:25.040
 we're at each other's throats.

1:41:25.040 --> 1:41:28.800
 We have a hard time getting anything meaningful done.

1:41:28.800 --> 1:41:31.280
 And I'm sure there are people who are saying,

1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:33.640
 well, that model looks appealing.

1:41:33.640 --> 1:41:37.440
 But just as people could look to the United States

1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:39.200
 and say, well, because the United States

1:41:39.200 --> 1:41:41.720
 has such a massive reach, what we do domestically

1:41:41.720 --> 1:41:44.720
 has huge implications for the rest of the world,

1:41:44.720 --> 1:41:48.160
 they become stakeholders in our politics.

1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:49.880
 And that's why I think for a lot of years,

1:41:49.880 --> 1:41:52.200
 people have just been looking at US politics,

1:41:52.200 --> 1:41:53.200
 not because it's interesting,

1:41:53.200 --> 1:41:55.320
 but because the decisions that we make

1:41:55.320 --> 1:41:58.080
 have big implications for their lives.

1:41:58.080 --> 1:41:59.760
 The same is true for ours.

1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:04.200
 You could say that the lack of civil and political rights

1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:08.680
 in China is, I mean, it's up to the Chinese,

1:42:08.680 --> 1:42:10.360
 not even people, because they have no say,

1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:12.640
 but to their government.

1:42:12.640 --> 1:42:14.280
 And they weren't democratically elected,

1:42:14.280 --> 1:42:17.680
 that they are recognized as the government.

1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:22.680
 But some significant percentage of the 15 million people

1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:26.000
 now dead from COVID are dead

1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:29.680
 because in the earliest days following the outbreak,

1:42:29.680 --> 1:42:33.040
 whatever the origin, the voices of people

1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:35.280
 sounding the alarm were suppressed,

1:42:35.280 --> 1:42:37.240
 that the Chinese government had an,

1:42:37.240 --> 1:42:39.560
 just like in Chernobyl, the Chinese government

1:42:39.560 --> 1:42:42.560
 had a greater incentive to lie

1:42:42.560 --> 1:42:46.640
 to the international community than to tell the truth.

1:42:46.640 --> 1:42:49.280
 And everybody was incentivized

1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:51.920
 to pretty much do the wrong thing.

1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:55.200
 And so that's why I think one of the big messages

1:42:55.200 --> 1:42:57.600
 of this pandemic is that all of our fates

1:42:57.600 --> 1:43:00.280
 are tied to everybody else's fates.

1:43:00.280 --> 1:43:02.760
 And so while we can say and should say,

1:43:02.760 --> 1:43:06.480
 well, let's focus on our own communities and our countries,

1:43:06.480 --> 1:43:09.960
 we're all stakeholders in what happens elsewhere.

1:43:09.960 --> 1:43:14.960
 Can I ask you a weird question?

1:43:14.960 --> 1:43:19.960
 So I'm gonna do a few podcast interviews

1:43:20.320 --> 1:43:24.360
 with interesting people in Russia, in the Russian language,

1:43:24.360 --> 1:43:25.840
 because I could speak Russian.

1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:29.160
 And a lot of those people have,

1:43:30.800 --> 1:43:34.120
 are not usually speaking in these kinds of formats.

1:43:36.560 --> 1:43:40.480
 Do you think it's possible to interview Xi Jinping?

1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:44.480
 Do you think it's possible to interview somebody like her

1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:47.320
 or anyone in the Chinese government?

1:43:47.320 --> 1:43:48.680
 I think not.

1:43:49.720 --> 1:43:52.520
 And I think the reason is

1:43:52.520 --> 1:43:54.640
 because I think they would, one,

1:43:54.640 --> 1:43:57.640
 be uncomfortable being in any environment

1:43:57.640 --> 1:44:02.080
 where really unknown questions will be asked.

1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:06.080
 And I actually, so as you know, on this topic,

1:44:06.080 --> 1:44:07.360
 the Chinese, as I mentioned earlier,

1:44:07.360 --> 1:44:10.800
 the Chinese government has a gag order on Chinese scientists.

1:44:10.800 --> 1:44:13.000
 They can't speak without prior government approval.

1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:15.600
 Xu Zhengli has been able to speak.

1:44:15.600 --> 1:44:17.160
 And she's spoken at a number of forums.

1:44:17.160 --> 1:44:19.960
 I mentioned this Rutgers event.

1:44:19.960 --> 1:44:23.080
 What was the nature of that forum, the Rutgers event?

1:44:23.080 --> 1:44:26.320
 All of them were kind of science conversations

1:44:26.320 --> 1:44:31.320
 about the pandemic, including the origins issue.

1:44:33.640 --> 1:44:37.080
 But I think that she, in her response to my question,

1:44:37.080 --> 1:44:38.680
 it was kind of this funny thing.

1:44:38.680 --> 1:44:42.680
 So they had this event organized by Rutgers.

1:44:42.680 --> 1:44:45.680
 And I went on, there was an online event on Zoom,

1:44:45.680 --> 1:44:47.920
 but I got on there and I just realized

1:44:47.920 --> 1:44:49.480
 it was very poorly organized.

1:44:49.480 --> 1:44:51.720
 Like normally the controls that you would have

1:44:51.720 --> 1:44:54.320
 about who gets to chat to who, who gets to ask questions,

1:44:54.320 --> 1:44:56.760
 none of them were set.

1:44:56.760 --> 1:44:58.360
 And so I kind of couldn't believe it.

1:44:58.360 --> 1:45:02.200
 I was just sitting at home in my neon green fleece

1:45:02.200 --> 1:45:06.560
 and I just started sending chat messages to Xu Zhengli.

1:45:06.560 --> 1:45:08.360
 So you could, anybody could send any.

1:45:08.360 --> 1:45:09.720
 Anybody could, it was insane.

1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:11.680
 But I thought, wow, this is incredible.

1:45:11.680 --> 1:45:16.040
 And so then it was unclear who got to ask questions.

1:45:16.040 --> 1:45:18.240
 And so I was like posting questions

1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:20.680
 and then I was sending chats to the organizers

1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:23.440
 of the event saying, I really have a question.

1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:27.360
 And first they said, well, you can submit your questions

1:45:27.360 --> 1:45:29.200
 and we'll have submitted questions.

1:45:29.200 --> 1:45:31.160
 And then if we have time, we'll open up.

1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:33.000
 So I just, I mean, I just thought, well, what the hell?

1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:34.680
 I just sent messages to everybody.

1:45:34.680 --> 1:45:37.120
 And then the event was already done.

1:45:37.120 --> 1:45:39.400
 They were 15 minutes over time.

1:45:39.400 --> 1:45:40.440
 And then they said, all right,

1:45:40.440 --> 1:45:42.400
 we have time just for one question.

1:45:42.400 --> 1:45:44.880
 And it's Jamie Metzl.

1:45:44.880 --> 1:45:47.200
 And like, as I'm sitting there in my running clothes,

1:45:47.200 --> 1:45:50.440
 like I wasn't, I was like multitasking and I heard my name.

1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:55.440
 And so I went diving back and I asked this question

1:45:55.920 --> 1:46:00.200
 about, did you know all of the work that was happening

1:46:00.200 --> 1:46:05.200
 at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, not just your work?

1:46:06.280 --> 1:46:10.520
 And can you confirm that US intelligence has said

1:46:10.520 --> 1:46:14.240
 that the military played a role,

1:46:14.240 --> 1:46:16.720
 was engaged with the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

1:46:16.720 --> 1:46:19.120
 Do you deny that the Chinese military was involved

1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:21.680
 in any way with the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

1:46:21.680 --> 1:46:24.760
 And as I said before, she said, this is crazy.

1:46:24.760 --> 1:46:26.240
 Absolutely not.

1:46:26.240 --> 1:46:27.200
 It got, it actually got,

1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:29.000
 that one question got covered in the media

1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:32.240
 because it was like, I think an essential question.

1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:35.200
 But I just think that since then, to my knowledge,

1:46:35.200 --> 1:46:38.280
 she's not been in any public forums,

1:46:38.280 --> 1:46:41.160
 but that's why most people would be shocked

1:46:41.160 --> 1:46:43.640
 that to date there has been no comprehensive

1:46:43.640 --> 1:46:46.600
 international investigation into pandemic origins.

1:46:46.600 --> 1:46:49.000
 There is no whistleblower provision.

1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:52.760
 So if you're, my guess is there are at least tens,

1:46:52.760 --> 1:46:55.200
 maybe hundreds of people in China

1:46:55.200 --> 1:46:56.960
 who have relevant information

1:46:56.960 --> 1:47:00.120
 about the origins of the pandemic who are terrified

1:47:00.120 --> 1:47:01.840
 and don't dare share it.

1:47:01.840 --> 1:47:04.360
 And let's just say somebody wanted

1:47:04.360 --> 1:47:08.480
 to get that information out, to send it somewhere.

1:47:08.480 --> 1:47:10.440
 There's no official address.

1:47:10.440 --> 1:47:13.920
 The WHO doesn't have that, nobody has that.

1:47:13.920 --> 1:47:16.640
 And so I would love, I mean, you may as well ask.

1:47:16.640 --> 1:47:21.080
 I don't think it's likely that there'll be a yes,

1:47:21.080 --> 1:47:23.640
 but it could well be that there are defectors

1:47:23.640 --> 1:47:25.360
 who will want to speak.

1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:29.240
 So let me also push back on this idea.

1:47:29.240 --> 1:47:33.400
 So one, I want to ask if the language barrier is a thing.

1:47:33.400 --> 1:47:34.720
 Because I've talked to,

1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:38.360
 so I understand Russian culture, I think,

1:47:38.360 --> 1:47:40.440
 or not understand, this is the thing.

1:47:40.440 --> 1:47:45.440
 I don't understand basically anything in this world.

1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:50.440
 But I mean, I hear the music that is Russian culture

1:47:50.440 --> 1:47:51.840
 and I enjoy it.

1:47:51.840 --> 1:47:55.360
 I don't hear that music for Chinese culture.

1:47:55.360 --> 1:47:57.000
 It's just not something I've experienced.

1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:00.160
 So it's a beautiful, rich, complex culture.

1:48:00.160 --> 1:48:05.160
 And from my sense, it seems distant to me.

1:48:05.160 --> 1:48:10.160
 Like whenever I look, even like we mentioned offline Japan

1:48:10.760 --> 1:48:13.560
 and so on, I probably don't even understand

1:48:13.560 --> 1:48:14.440
 Japanese culture.

1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:16.760
 I believe I kind of do because I did martial arts

1:48:16.760 --> 1:48:20.200
 my whole life, but even that, it's just so distant.

1:48:20.200 --> 1:48:23.360
 People who've lived in Japan, foreigners for like 20 years

1:48:23.360 --> 1:48:25.240
 say the exact same thing, yeah.

1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:26.200
 This makes me sad.

1:48:26.200 --> 1:48:29.280
 It makes me sad because I will never be able

1:48:29.280 --> 1:48:34.160
 to fully appreciate the literature, the conversations,

1:48:34.160 --> 1:48:38.120
 the people, the little humor and the subtleties.

1:48:38.120 --> 1:48:39.960
 And those are all essential to understand

1:48:39.960 --> 1:48:43.760
 even this cold topics of science.

1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:46.160
 Because all of that is important to understand.

1:48:46.160 --> 1:48:48.240
 So that's a question for me if you think

1:48:48.240 --> 1:48:49.760
 language barriers a thing.

1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:52.120
 But the other thing I just want to kind of comment on

1:48:52.120 --> 1:48:57.120
 is the criticism of journalism that somebody like

1:48:57.120 --> 1:49:02.120
 Shi Zhengli or even Shi Zhengpeng, just anybody in China,

1:49:05.880 --> 1:49:08.760
 very skeptical to have really conversations

1:49:08.760 --> 1:49:11.400
 with anybody in the western media.

1:49:11.400 --> 1:49:16.400
 Because it's like what are the odds that they will try

1:49:16.880 --> 1:49:19.560
 to bring out the beautiful ideas in the person.

1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:23.480
 And honestly, this is a harsh criticism.

1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:28.480
 I apologize, but I kind of mean it, is the journalists

1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:34.040
 that have some of these high profile conversations

1:49:34.040 --> 1:49:36.800
 often don't do the work.

1:49:36.800 --> 1:49:39.480
 They come off as not very intelligent.

1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:41.360
 And I know they're intelligent people.

1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:43.480
 They have not done the research.

1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:46.520
 They have not come up and like read a bunch of books.

1:49:46.520 --> 1:49:48.880
 They have not even read the Wikipedia article.

1:49:48.880 --> 1:49:52.480
 Meaning put in the minimal effort to empathize,

1:49:52.480 --> 1:49:54.760
 to try to understand the culture of the people,

1:49:54.760 --> 1:49:58.720
 all the complexities, all the different ideas in the spaces.

1:49:58.720 --> 1:50:00.920
 Do all the incredible, not all,

1:50:00.920 --> 1:50:04.240
 but some of the incredible work that you've done initially.

1:50:04.240 --> 1:50:07.120
 Like that, you have to do that work to earn the right

1:50:07.120 --> 1:50:11.240
 to have a deep real conversation with some of these folks.

1:50:11.240 --> 1:50:13.360
 And it's just disappointing to me

1:50:13.360 --> 1:50:15.280
 that journalists often don't do that work.

1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:19.640
 Yeah, so on that, just first I completely agree with you.

1:50:19.640 --> 1:50:22.600
 I mean, there is just an incredible beauty

1:50:22.600 --> 1:50:25.240
 in Chinese culture and I think all cultures,

1:50:25.240 --> 1:50:29.160
 but certainly China has such a deep and rich history,

1:50:29.160 --> 1:50:34.160
 amazing literature and art and just human beings.

1:50:34.680 --> 1:50:38.000
 I mean, I'm a massive critic of the Chinese government.

1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:42.720
 I'm very vociferous about the really genocide in Xinjiang,

1:50:42.720 --> 1:50:46.560
 the absolute effort to destroy Tibetan culture,

1:50:46.560 --> 1:50:51.040
 the destruction of democracy in Hong Kong,

1:50:51.040 --> 1:50:54.160
 incredibly illegal efforts to seize

1:50:54.160 --> 1:50:56.520
 basically the entire South China Sea.

1:50:56.520 --> 1:50:59.640
 And I could go on and on and on.

1:50:59.640 --> 1:51:02.680
 But Chinese culture is fantastic.

1:51:02.680 --> 1:51:05.720
 And I mean, I can't speak to every technical field,

1:51:05.720 --> 1:51:09.000
 but just in terms of having journalists,

1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:10.560
 and I'll speak to American journalists,

1:51:10.560 --> 1:51:14.880
 people like Peter Hessler who have really invested the time

1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:19.480
 to live in China, to learn the language, learn the culture.

1:51:19.480 --> 1:51:22.920
 Peter himself, who is maybe one of our best journalists

1:51:22.920 --> 1:51:26.080
 covering China from a soul level,

1:51:26.080 --> 1:51:27.920
 he was kicked out of China.

1:51:27.920 --> 1:51:30.440
 So it's very, very difficult.

1:51:30.440 --> 1:51:31.280
 His stuff.

1:51:31.280 --> 1:51:32.120
 His stuff.

1:51:32.120 --> 1:51:32.960
 Yeah, it's really, and so for me,

1:51:32.960 --> 1:51:36.640
 you talked about my website on pandemic origins.

1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:38.880
 So when I launched it, I had it,

1:51:38.880 --> 1:51:40.520
 I'm not a Chinese speaker,

1:51:40.520 --> 1:51:44.120
 but I had the entire site translated into Chinese

1:51:44.120 --> 1:51:48.040
 and I have it up on my website just because I felt like,

1:51:48.040 --> 1:51:51.400
 well, if somebody, I mean, the great firewall

1:51:51.400 --> 1:51:53.760
 makes it very, very difficult for people in China

1:51:53.760 --> 1:51:56.320
 to access that kind of information.

1:51:56.320 --> 1:51:58.520
 But I figured if somebody gets there

1:51:58.520 --> 1:52:02.000
 and they wanna have it in their own language.

1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:04.320
 But it's hard because the Chinese government

1:52:04.320 --> 1:52:08.560
 is represented by these quote unquote wolf warriors,

1:52:08.560 --> 1:52:11.840
 which is, it's like these basic ruffians.

1:52:11.840 --> 1:52:15.440
 And I personally was condemned by name

1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:17.560
 by the spokesman of the Chinese foreign ministry

1:52:17.560 --> 1:52:20.680
 from the podium in Beijing.

1:52:20.680 --> 1:52:24.160
 And so it's really hard because I absolutely think

1:52:25.160 --> 1:52:27.800
 the American people and the Chinese people,

1:52:27.800 --> 1:52:31.280
 I mean, maybe all people, but we have so much in common.

1:52:31.280 --> 1:52:36.240
 I mean, yes, China is an ancient civilization,

1:52:36.240 --> 1:52:38.880
 but they kind of wiped out their own civilization

1:52:38.880 --> 1:52:41.240
 in the great leap forward and cultural revolution.

1:52:41.240 --> 1:52:44.960
 They burned their scrolls, they smashed their artworks.

1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:47.440
 And so it's a very young society,

1:52:47.440 --> 1:52:50.600
 kind of like America is a young society.

1:52:50.600 --> 1:52:52.760
 So we have a lot in common.

1:52:53.760 --> 1:52:57.040
 And if we just kind of got out of our own ways,

1:52:57.040 --> 1:52:59.640
 we could have a beautiful relationship,

1:52:59.640 --> 1:53:01.960
 but there's a lot of things that are happening.

1:53:01.960 --> 1:53:04.120
 Certainly the United States feels responsible

1:53:04.120 --> 1:53:07.280
 to defend the post war international order

1:53:07.280 --> 1:53:09.760
 that past generations helped build.

1:53:09.760 --> 1:53:11.800
 And I'm a certain believer in that

1:53:11.800 --> 1:53:16.600
 and China is challenging that and the Chinese government

1:53:16.600 --> 1:53:18.600
 and they've shared that with that view

1:53:18.600 --> 1:53:19.680
 with the Chinese people feel

1:53:19.680 --> 1:53:21.760
 that they haven't been adequately respected.

1:53:21.760 --> 1:53:26.000
 And now they're building a massive nuclear arsenal

1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:29.120
 and all these other things to try to position themselves

1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:31.160
 in the world with an articulated goal

1:53:31.160 --> 1:53:33.040
 of being the lead country in the world.

1:53:33.040 --> 1:53:34.880
 And that puts them at odds with the United States.

1:53:34.880 --> 1:53:37.560
 So there are a lot of real reasons

1:53:37.560 --> 1:53:39.960
 that we need to be honest about for division.

1:53:39.960 --> 1:53:42.480
 But if that's all we focus on,

1:53:42.480 --> 1:53:45.680
 if we don't say that there's another side of the story

1:53:45.680 --> 1:53:47.680
 that brings us together,

1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:51.320
 we'll put ourselves on an inevitable glide path

1:53:51.320 --> 1:53:52.440
 to a terrible outcome.

1:53:53.480 --> 1:53:55.840
 What do you make of Xi Jinping?

1:53:57.000 --> 1:53:57.920
 So two questions.

1:53:57.920 --> 1:54:01.280
 So one in general and two more on lab leak

1:54:01.280 --> 1:54:05.600
 and his meeting with our president Biden

1:54:05.600 --> 1:54:07.800
 in discussion of lab leak.

1:54:07.800 --> 1:54:12.800
 So I feel that Xi Jinping has a very narrow goal

1:54:15.200 --> 1:54:17.640
 articulated of establishing China

1:54:17.640 --> 1:54:20.120
 as the lead country in the world

1:54:20.120 --> 1:54:22.880
 by the 100th anniversary of the founding

1:54:22.880 --> 1:54:26.360
 of the modern Chinese state.

1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:29.720
 And it's ruthless and it's strategic.

1:54:29.720 --> 1:54:33.680
 There's a great book called The Long Game by Rush Doshi

1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:36.720
 who's actually now working in the White House

1:54:36.720 --> 1:54:41.360
 about this goal and our pretty clearly articulated goal

1:54:41.360 --> 1:54:45.040
 to subvert the post war international order

1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:47.200
 and in China's interest.

1:54:47.200 --> 1:54:50.560
 And maybe every leader wants to organize the world

1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:51.480
 around their interest.

1:54:51.480 --> 1:54:56.320
 But I feel that his vision of what that entails

1:54:56.320 --> 1:54:59.120
 is not one that I think is shareable

1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:00.040
 for the rest of the world.

1:55:00.040 --> 1:55:01.600
 I mean, the strength of the United States

1:55:01.600 --> 1:55:04.480
 with all of our flaws is particularly

1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:06.840
 in that post war period,

1:55:06.840 --> 1:55:10.280
 we put forward a model that was desirable

1:55:10.280 --> 1:55:11.120
 to a lot of people.

1:55:11.120 --> 1:55:13.640
 Certainly it was desirable to people in Western Europe

1:55:13.640 --> 1:55:17.800
 and then Eastern Europe and Japan and Korea.

1:55:17.800 --> 1:55:18.800
 Doesn't mean it's perfect.

1:55:18.800 --> 1:55:21.520
 The United States is deeply flawed.

1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:23.520
 As articulated to date,

1:55:23.520 --> 1:55:26.760
 I don't think most people and countries

1:55:26.760 --> 1:55:30.280
 would like to live in a Sinocentric world.

1:55:30.280 --> 1:55:32.400
 And so I certainly, as I mentioned before,

1:55:32.400 --> 1:55:34.960
 I'm a huge critic of what Xi Jinping is doing,

1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:39.240
 the incredible brutality in Xinjiang,

1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:42.560
 in Tibet and elsewhere.

1:55:42.560 --> 1:55:47.560
 Yeah, the censorship one gives me a lot of trouble

1:55:47.880 --> 1:55:51.120
 on the science realm and just in journalism

1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:53.440
 and just the world that prevents us

1:55:53.440 --> 1:55:56.200
 from having conversations with each other.

1:55:56.200 --> 1:55:58.640
 Do you know about the Winnie the Pooh thing?

1:55:58.640 --> 1:56:01.040
 Yes, I mean, it's ridiculous.

1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:03.680
 So to me, that's such a good illustration

1:56:03.680 --> 1:56:07.400
 of censorship being petty.

1:56:08.240 --> 1:56:09.720
 But censorship has to be petty

1:56:09.720 --> 1:56:12.160
 because the goal of censorship,

1:56:12.160 --> 1:56:14.720
 maybe you experienced in the Soviet Union,

1:56:14.720 --> 1:56:16.560
 is to get into your head.

1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:17.840
 Like if it's just censorship,

1:56:17.840 --> 1:56:20.720
 like you say down with the state

1:56:20.720 --> 1:56:22.720
 and like you can't say that,

1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:26.200
 but you can say all the other things up to that point,

1:56:26.200 --> 1:56:28.520
 eventually people will feel empowered

1:56:28.520 --> 1:56:29.600
 to say down with the state.

1:56:29.600 --> 1:56:30.960
 And so I think the goal

1:56:30.960 --> 1:56:33.760
 of this kind of authoritarian censorship

1:56:33.760 --> 1:56:36.200
 is to turn you into the censor.

1:56:36.200 --> 1:56:38.280
 And so the...

1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:39.120
 Like self censor.

1:56:39.120 --> 1:56:41.480
 Yeah, because they almost have to have you think,

1:56:41.480 --> 1:56:43.560
 well, if I'm gonna make any criticism,

1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:45.880
 maybe they're gonna come and get me.

1:56:45.880 --> 1:56:48.560
 So it's safer to not do it.

1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:50.280
 I mean, I've traveled through North Korea

1:56:50.280 --> 1:56:53.480
 pretty extensively and I've seen that in its ultimate form,

1:56:53.480 --> 1:56:56.760
 but that's what they're trying to do in China too.

1:56:56.760 --> 1:57:00.080
 Yeah, so for people who are not familiar,

1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:01.680
 it's such a clear illustration

1:57:01.680 --> 1:57:03.880
 of just the pettiness of censorship

1:57:03.880 --> 1:57:07.200
 and leaders, the corrupting nature of power.

1:57:07.200 --> 1:57:10.880
 But there's a meme of Xi Jinping

1:57:10.880 --> 1:57:13.840
 with, I guess, Barack Obama.

1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:18.400
 And the meme is that he looks like Winnie the Pooh

1:57:18.400 --> 1:57:20.800
 in that picture.

1:57:20.800 --> 1:57:25.200
 And that was the President Xi Jinping

1:57:25.200 --> 1:57:26.400
 looks like Winnie the Pooh.

1:57:26.400 --> 1:57:30.040
 And I guess that became, because that got censored,

1:57:30.040 --> 1:57:32.240
 like mentions of Winnie the Pooh got censored

1:57:32.240 --> 1:57:33.760
 all across China.

1:57:33.760 --> 1:57:38.200
 Winnie the Pooh became the unknowing revolutionary hero

1:57:38.200 --> 1:57:41.560
 that represents freedom of speech and so on.

1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:44.800
 But it's just such a absurd...

1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:47.800
 Because we spend so much time in this conversation

1:57:47.800 --> 1:57:49.720
 talking about the censorship

1:57:49.720 --> 1:57:52.400
 that's a little bit more understandable to me,

1:57:52.400 --> 1:57:55.320
 which is like, we messed up.

1:57:55.320 --> 1:57:59.680
 And it wasn't, maybe it's almost understandable errors

1:57:59.680 --> 1:58:02.680
 that happen in the progress of science.

1:58:02.680 --> 1:58:05.520
 I mean, you could always argue

1:58:05.520 --> 1:58:09.160
 that there's a lot of mistakes along the way

1:58:09.160 --> 1:58:11.920
 and the censorship along the way caused the big mistake.

1:58:11.920 --> 1:58:14.320
 You can argue that same way for the Chernobyl.

1:58:14.320 --> 1:58:18.280
 But those are sort of understandable and difficult topics.

1:58:18.280 --> 1:58:19.800
 Like Winnie the Pooh.

1:58:19.800 --> 1:58:22.160
 But in your message, it shows both sides of the story.

1:58:22.160 --> 1:58:26.280
 I mean, one, how petty authoritarian censors have to be.

1:58:26.280 --> 1:58:29.160
 And that's why the messaging from the Chinese government

1:58:29.160 --> 1:58:30.640
 is so consistent.

1:58:30.640 --> 1:58:32.480
 No matter who you are,

1:58:32.480 --> 1:58:33.960
 you have to be careful what you say.

1:58:33.960 --> 1:58:37.200
 And that's why it's the story of Peng Shui,

1:58:37.200 --> 1:58:38.600
 the tennis player.

1:58:38.600 --> 1:58:42.360
 She dared raise her voice in an individual way.

1:58:42.360 --> 1:58:46.840
 Jack Ma, the richest man in China,

1:58:46.840 --> 1:58:50.440
 had a minor criticism of the Chinese government.

1:58:50.440 --> 1:58:54.560
 He had basically disappeared from the public eye.

1:58:54.560 --> 1:58:57.560
 Fan Bingbing, who's like one of the leading

1:58:57.560 --> 1:58:59.320
 Chinese movie stars,

1:58:59.320 --> 1:59:03.320
 she was seen as not loyal enough and she just vanished.

1:59:03.320 --> 1:59:06.240
 And so the message is no matter who you are,

1:59:06.240 --> 1:59:08.080
 no matter what level,

1:59:08.080 --> 1:59:11.520
 if you don't mind everything you say,

1:59:11.520 --> 1:59:12.680
 you could lose everything.

1:59:12.680 --> 1:59:15.160
 I'm pretty hopeful, optimistic about a lot of things.

1:59:15.160 --> 1:59:18.920
 And so for me, if the Chinese government stays

1:59:19.840 --> 1:59:21.160
 with its current structure,

1:59:21.160 --> 1:59:24.600
 I think what I hope they start fixing

1:59:24.600 --> 1:59:26.600
 is the freedom of speech.

1:59:26.600 --> 1:59:27.440
 But they can't.

1:59:27.440 --> 1:59:32.200
 I mean, the thing is if they open up freedom of speech

1:59:32.200 --> 1:59:34.320
 really in a meaningful way,

1:59:34.320 --> 1:59:38.320
 they can't maintain their current form of government.

1:59:38.320 --> 1:59:40.320
 And it's connected, as I was saying before,

1:59:40.320 --> 1:59:42.520
 to the origins of the pandemic.

1:59:42.520 --> 1:59:45.040
 I mean, if my hypothesis was right,

1:59:45.040 --> 1:59:48.840
 that was the big choice that the national government had.

1:59:48.840 --> 1:59:51.760
 Do we really investigate the origins of the pandemic?

1:59:51.760 --> 1:59:55.600
 Do we deliver a message that transparency is required,

1:59:55.600 --> 1:59:58.840
 public transparency is required from local officials?

1:59:58.840 --> 2:00:02.040
 If they do that, the entire system collapsed.

2:00:02.040 --> 2:00:06.600
 Pretty much everybody in China has a relative

2:00:06.600 --> 2:00:09.800
 who has died as a result of the actions

2:00:09.800 --> 2:00:10.760
 of the Communist Party,

2:00:10.760 --> 2:00:12.600
 particularly in the Great Leap Forward.

2:00:12.600 --> 2:00:15.160
 It's nearly 50 million people died

2:00:15.160 --> 2:00:18.560
 as a result of Mao's disastrous policies.

2:00:18.560 --> 2:00:21.800
 And yet why is Mao's picture still on Tiananmen Square

2:00:21.800 --> 2:00:23.520
 and it's on the money?

2:00:23.520 --> 2:00:26.040
 Because maintaining that fiction

2:00:26.040 --> 2:00:29.880
 is the foundation of the legitimacy of the Chinese state.

2:00:29.880 --> 2:00:32.280
 If people were allowed, just say what you want.

2:00:32.280 --> 2:00:35.160
 Do you really think Mao was such a great guy,

2:00:35.160 --> 2:00:39.280
 even though your own relatives are dead as a result?

2:00:39.280 --> 2:00:43.840
 Do you really buy even on this story

2:00:43.840 --> 2:00:45.240
 that China did nothing wrong,

2:00:45.240 --> 2:00:48.240
 even though in the earliest days of the pandemic,

2:00:48.240 --> 2:00:51.120
 these two, at least Chinese scientists themselves,

2:00:51.120 --> 2:00:54.960
 courageously issued a preprint paper

2:00:54.960 --> 2:00:58.600
 that was later almost certainly forcibly retracted,

2:00:58.600 --> 2:01:00.360
 saying, well, this looks like this comes

2:01:00.360 --> 2:01:03.320
 from one of the Wuhan labs that we're studying.

2:01:03.320 --> 2:01:06.880
 Like if you opened up that window,

2:01:06.880 --> 2:01:09.640
 I think that the Chinese government

2:01:09.640 --> 2:01:12.400
 would not be able to continue in its current form.

2:01:12.400 --> 2:01:14.960
 And that's why they cracked down at Tiananmen Square.

2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:17.840
 That's why with Feng Shui, the tennis player,

2:01:17.840 --> 2:01:21.040
 if they had let her accuse somebody

2:01:21.040 --> 2:01:24.680
 from the Communist Party of sexual assault,

2:01:24.680 --> 2:01:26.960
 and they said, okay, now people,

2:01:26.960 --> 2:01:28.560
 you can use social media

2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:30.600
 and you can have your me too moment

2:01:30.600 --> 2:01:34.600
 and let us know who in the Chinese Communist Party

2:01:34.600 --> 2:01:37.480
 or your boss in a business has assaulted you.

2:01:37.480 --> 2:01:38.720
 Just like in every society,

2:01:38.720 --> 2:01:40.040
 I'm sure there's tons of women

2:01:40.040 --> 2:01:45.040
 who've been sexually assaulted, manipulated, abused by men.

2:01:45.480 --> 2:01:48.480
 And so I certainly hope

2:01:48.480 --> 2:01:51.200
 that there can be that kind of opening.

2:01:51.200 --> 2:01:54.300
 But if I were an authoritarian dictator,

2:01:54.300 --> 2:01:56.640
 that's the thing I would be most afraid of.

2:01:56.640 --> 2:01:58.040
 Yeah, dictator perhaps,

2:01:58.040 --> 2:02:01.240
 but I think you can gradually increase the freedom of speech.

2:02:01.240 --> 2:02:04.840
 So I think you can maintain control over the freedom

2:02:04.840 --> 2:02:06.160
 of press first.

2:02:06.160 --> 2:02:08.320
 So control the press more,

2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:13.320
 but let the lower levels sort of open up YouTube, right?

2:02:13.560 --> 2:02:17.000
 Open up like where individual citizens can make content.

2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:19.100
 I mean, there's a lot of benefits to that.

2:02:19.100 --> 2:02:22.760
 And then from an authoritarian perspective,

2:02:22.760 --> 2:02:25.600
 you can just say that's misinformation,

2:02:25.600 --> 2:02:28.420
 that's conspiracy theories, all those kinds of things.

2:02:28.420 --> 2:02:32.560
 But at least I think if you open up that freedom of speech

2:02:32.560 --> 2:02:34.580
 at the level of the individual citizen,

2:02:35.880 --> 2:02:38.000
 that's good for entrepreneurship,

2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:39.600
 for the development of ideas,

2:02:39.600 --> 2:02:41.440
 of exchange of ideas, all that kind of stuff.

2:02:41.440 --> 2:02:44.160
 I just think that increased the GDP of the country.

2:02:44.160 --> 2:02:46.080
 So I think there's a lot of benefits.

2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:48.360
 I feel like you can still play,

2:02:48.360 --> 2:02:50.800
 we're playing some like dark thoughts here,

2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:54.620
 but I feel like you could still play the game of thrones,

2:02:54.620 --> 2:02:59.620
 still maintain power while giving freedom to the citizenry.

2:03:00.120 --> 2:03:04.200
 Like I think just like with North Korea is a good example

2:03:04.200 --> 2:03:07.320
 of where cracking down too much

2:03:07.320 --> 2:03:10.360
 can completely destroy your country.

2:03:10.360 --> 2:03:14.520
 Like there's some balance you can strike in your evil mind

2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:17.400
 and still maintain authoritarian control over the country.

2:03:17.400 --> 2:03:20.960
 Obviously, it's not obvious,

2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:24.080
 but I'm a big supporter of freedom of speech.

2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:26.560
 I mean, it seems to work really well.

2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:28.000
 I don't know what the failure cases

2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:29.280
 for freedom of speech are.

2:03:30.420 --> 2:03:32.800
 Probably we're experiencing them with Twitter

2:03:32.800 --> 2:03:34.320
 and like where the nature of truth

2:03:34.320 --> 2:03:38.960
 is being completely kind of flipped upside down.

2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:41.640
 But it seems like on the whole,

2:03:41.640 --> 2:03:46.640
 ability to defeat lies with more,

2:03:47.280 --> 2:03:50.780
 not through censorship, but through more conversations,

2:03:50.780 --> 2:03:53.120
 more information is the right way to go.

2:03:53.120 --> 2:03:54.720
 Can I tell you a little story, true stories

2:03:54.720 --> 2:03:56.000
 about North Korea?

2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:58.560
 So a number of years ago, I was invited

2:03:58.560 --> 2:04:01.720
 to be part of a small six person delegation

2:04:01.720 --> 2:04:04.800
 advising the government of North Korea

2:04:04.800 --> 2:04:07.360
 on how to establish special economic zones

2:04:07.360 --> 2:04:10.560
 because other countries have used these SEZs

2:04:10.560 --> 2:04:13.000
 as a way of building their economies.

2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:15.640
 And when I was invited, I thought,

2:04:15.640 --> 2:04:17.900
 well, maybe there's an opening.

2:04:17.900 --> 2:04:19.980
 And I certainly believe in that.

2:04:19.980 --> 2:04:24.560
 So we flew to China across the border into North Korea.

2:04:24.560 --> 2:04:27.360
 And then we were met by our partners

2:04:27.360 --> 2:04:30.060
 from the North Korean Development Organization.

2:04:30.060 --> 2:04:33.960
 And then we zigzagged the country for almost two weeks

2:04:33.960 --> 2:04:38.060
 visiting all these sites for where they were intended

2:04:38.060 --> 2:04:39.840
 to create these special economic zones.

2:04:39.840 --> 2:04:42.680
 And in each site, they had their local officials

2:04:42.680 --> 2:04:45.320
 and they had a map and they showed us where everything

2:04:45.320 --> 2:04:47.080
 that was going to be built.

2:04:47.080 --> 2:04:50.320
 And the other people who were like really technical experts

2:04:50.320 --> 2:04:52.120
 on how to set up a special economic zone,

2:04:52.120 --> 2:04:53.800
 they were asking questions, well, like,

2:04:53.800 --> 2:04:55.760
 should you put the entrance over here

2:04:55.760 --> 2:04:56.960
 or shouldn't you put it over there

2:04:56.960 --> 2:04:58.480
 and what if there's flooding?

2:04:58.480 --> 2:05:00.480
 And I kept asking just these basic questions,

2:05:00.480 --> 2:05:02.960
 like, what do you think you're going to do here?

2:05:02.960 --> 2:05:05.280
 Why do you think you can be competitive?

2:05:05.280 --> 2:05:07.880
 Do you know anything about who you're competing against?

2:05:07.880 --> 2:05:10.580
 Are you empowering your workers to innovate

2:05:10.580 --> 2:05:12.600
 because everybody else is innovating?

2:05:12.600 --> 2:05:14.880
 So at the end of the trip, they flew us to Pyongyang

2:05:14.880 --> 2:05:15.840
 and they put us in this,

2:05:15.840 --> 2:05:17.480
 it looked kind of like the United Nations.

2:05:17.480 --> 2:05:20.240
 They probably had 500 people there

2:05:20.240 --> 2:05:22.960
 and I gave a speech to them.

2:05:22.960 --> 2:05:26.560
 I obviously was in English and it was translated

2:05:26.560 --> 2:05:29.920
 and I figured, you know, I've come all this way,

2:05:29.920 --> 2:05:30.940
 I'm just going to be honest.

2:05:30.940 --> 2:05:34.760
 If they arrest me for being honest, that's on them.

2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:38.000
 And I said, I'm here because I believe

2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:39.700
 we can never give up hope,

2:05:39.700 --> 2:05:41.460
 that we always have to try to connect.

2:05:41.460 --> 2:05:45.440
 I'm also here because I think that North Korea

2:05:45.440 --> 2:05:50.240
 connecting to the world economy is an important first step.

2:05:50.240 --> 2:05:52.680
 But having visited all of your special economic zone sites

2:05:52.680 --> 2:05:56.100
 and having met with all of your, or many of your officials,

2:05:56.100 --> 2:05:59.440
 I don't think your plan has any chance of succeeding

2:05:59.440 --> 2:06:03.640
 because you're trying to sell into a global market,

2:06:03.640 --> 2:06:07.520
 but you need to have market information that,

2:06:07.520 --> 2:06:10.920
 and I gave examples of GE and others

2:06:10.920 --> 2:06:14.640
 that the innovation can't only happen at one place.

2:06:14.640 --> 2:06:17.800
 And if you want innovation to happen

2:06:17.800 --> 2:06:19.360
 from the people who are doing this,

2:06:19.360 --> 2:06:22.400
 you have to empower them, they have to have access,

2:06:22.400 --> 2:06:23.520
 they have to have voice.

2:06:23.520 --> 2:06:28.520
 I mean, nobody, I mean, the people after,

2:06:28.600 --> 2:06:30.160
 they kind of had to condemn me

2:06:30.160 --> 2:06:32.600
 because what I was saying was challenging.

2:06:32.600 --> 2:06:33.880
 So I certainly agree with you.

2:06:33.880 --> 2:06:36.800
 And then just one side story of then that night,

2:06:37.800 --> 2:06:39.040
 and it was just kind of bizarre

2:06:39.040 --> 2:06:42.400
 because North Korea is, it's so desperately poor,

2:06:42.400 --> 2:06:44.440
 but they were trying to impress us.

2:06:44.440 --> 2:06:49.300
 And so we had these embarrassingly sumptuous banquets.

2:06:49.300 --> 2:06:51.600
 And so for our final dinner that night,

2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:54.760
 really it looked like something from Beauty and the Beast.

2:06:54.760 --> 2:06:59.520
 I mean, it was like China and waiters and tuxedos,

2:06:59.520 --> 2:07:02.120
 and they had this beautiful dinner.

2:07:02.120 --> 2:07:04.240
 And then afterwards,

2:07:04.240 --> 2:07:05.580
 because we'd now spent two weeks

2:07:05.580 --> 2:07:07.060
 with our North Korean partners,

2:07:07.060 --> 2:07:08.980
 they brought out this karaoke machine

2:07:08.980 --> 2:07:11.060
 and our North Korean counterparts,

2:07:11.060 --> 2:07:15.240
 they sang songs to us in Korean.

2:07:15.240 --> 2:07:18.120
 And so I said, well, we want to reciprocate.

2:07:18.120 --> 2:07:21.240
 Do you have any English songs on your karaoke machine?

2:07:21.240 --> 2:07:23.320
 It's North Korea, obviously they didn't.

2:07:23.320 --> 2:07:25.560
 But there was, I said, well, I have an idea.

2:07:25.560 --> 2:07:27.120
 And so there was one of the women

2:07:27.120 --> 2:07:30.200
 who'd been part of the North Korean delegation.

2:07:30.200 --> 2:07:32.640
 She was able just to play the piano,

2:07:32.640 --> 2:07:34.400
 just like you could hum a tune

2:07:34.400 --> 2:07:36.160
 and she could play it on the piano.

2:07:36.160 --> 2:07:39.480
 And so I said, all right, here's this tune,

2:07:39.480 --> 2:07:41.000
 which I whispered in her ear.

2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:42.420
 When I give you the signal,

2:07:42.420 --> 2:07:45.400
 just play this tune over and over.

2:07:45.400 --> 2:07:48.200
 And so I got these, I mean, there were the six of us

2:07:48.200 --> 2:07:49.640
 and maybe 20 North Koreans,

2:07:49.640 --> 2:07:51.080
 and we were all in a circle,

2:07:51.080 --> 2:07:54.920
 so everybody hold hands and then put your right,

2:07:54.920 --> 2:07:57.600
 just try to put your right foot in front of your left

2:07:57.600 --> 2:08:00.560
 and then left foot in front of the right, going sideways.

2:08:00.560 --> 2:08:02.480
 And I said, all right, hit it.

2:08:02.480 --> 2:08:06.840
 And she played a North Korean version of Hava Nagila.

2:08:06.840 --> 2:08:08.120
 And I think it was the first

2:08:08.120 --> 2:08:11.680
 and only horror that they've ever done in North Korea.

2:08:11.680 --> 2:08:12.500
 That's hilarious.

2:08:12.500 --> 2:08:13.340
 I survived.

2:08:13.340 --> 2:08:14.220
 Was this recorded or no?

2:08:14.220 --> 2:08:15.060
 It was not.

2:08:15.060 --> 2:08:15.880
 Oh, no.

2:08:15.880 --> 2:08:18.160
 Yeah, if they had free YouTube,

2:08:18.160 --> 2:08:19.520
 this would have been a big one.

2:08:19.520 --> 2:08:20.360
 Yeah.

2:08:21.520 --> 2:08:23.080
 Let's return to the beginning

2:08:23.080 --> 2:08:26.980
 and just patient zero.

2:08:28.520 --> 2:08:30.760
 It's kind of always incredible to think

2:08:30.760 --> 2:08:33.840
 that there's one human at which it all started.

2:08:33.840 --> 2:08:36.360
 Yeah.

2:08:36.360 --> 2:08:38.760
 Who do you think was patient zero?

2:08:38.760 --> 2:08:42.640
 Do you think it was somebody that worked

2:08:42.640 --> 2:08:47.400
 at Wuhan Institute of Virology?

2:08:47.400 --> 2:08:52.400
 Do you think there was a leak of some other kind

2:08:52.440 --> 2:08:55.040
 that led to the infection?

2:08:55.040 --> 2:08:55.920
 What do we know?

2:08:55.920 --> 2:08:59.800
 Because there's this December 8th slash December 16th case

2:08:59.800 --> 2:09:04.400
 of maybe you can describe what that is.

2:09:04.400 --> 2:09:09.400
 And then there's like, what's his name?

2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:12.960
 Michael Warobey has a nice timeline.

2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:14.480
 I'm sure you have a timeline.

2:09:14.480 --> 2:09:17.880
 But he has a nice timeline that puts the average

2:09:17.880 --> 2:09:22.280
 at like November something, like 18th and November 16th

2:09:22.280 --> 2:09:27.200
 as the average estimate for when the patient zero

2:09:27.200 --> 2:09:30.360
 got infected, when the first human infection happened.

2:09:30.360 --> 2:09:32.080
 Yeah, so just two points.

2:09:32.080 --> 2:09:36.560
 One is it may be that there's infectee zero

2:09:36.560 --> 2:09:37.880
 and patient zero.

2:09:37.880 --> 2:09:41.280
 It could be that the first person infected was asymptomatic

2:09:41.280 --> 2:09:42.440
 because we know there's a lot of people

2:09:42.440 --> 2:09:44.240
 who are asymptomatic.

2:09:44.240 --> 2:09:47.640
 And then there's the question of, well, who is patient zero?

2:09:47.640 --> 2:09:51.040
 Meaning the first person to present themselves

2:09:51.040 --> 2:09:53.600
 in some kind of health facility

2:09:53.600 --> 2:09:56.400
 where that diagnosis could be made.

2:09:56.400 --> 2:09:58.640
 So can we actually linger on that definition?

2:09:58.640 --> 2:09:59.480
 Yeah.

2:09:59.480 --> 2:10:02.600
 So is that to you a good definition of patient zero?

2:10:02.600 --> 2:10:04.560
 Okay, there's a bunch of stuff here

2:10:04.560 --> 2:10:06.640
 because this virus is weird.

2:10:06.640 --> 2:10:11.120
 So one is who gets infected, one who is infectious

2:10:11.120 --> 2:10:14.400
 or the first person infect others.

2:10:14.400 --> 2:10:15.240
 Yeah.

2:10:15.240 --> 2:10:17.360
 And who shows up to a hospital.

2:10:17.360 --> 2:10:19.480
 Yeah, so I think that's why I'm calling the first person

2:10:19.480 --> 2:10:22.600
 to show up to a hospital who's diagnosed with COVID 19.

2:10:22.600 --> 2:10:24.560
 I'm calling that person patient zero.

2:10:24.560 --> 2:10:28.480
 There's also, there's somewhere the first person

2:10:28.480 --> 2:10:29.760
 to be infected.

2:10:29.760 --> 2:10:32.800
 And that person maybe never showed up in a hospital

2:10:32.800 --> 2:10:36.400
 because maybe they were asymptomatic and never get sick,

2:10:36.400 --> 2:10:37.240
 so got sick.

2:10:37.240 --> 2:10:40.560
 So let me start with what I'm calling infectee zero.

2:10:40.560 --> 2:10:41.720
 Here are some options.

2:10:41.720 --> 2:10:46.320
 I talked before about some person who was a villager

2:10:46.320 --> 2:10:47.720
 and some remote village.

2:10:47.720 --> 2:10:51.680
 It's almost impossible to imagine, but possible to imagine

2:10:51.680 --> 2:10:54.000
 because strange things happen.

2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:57.280
 And that person somehow gets to Wuhan.

2:10:57.280 --> 2:11:00.400
 By the way, just to still make that argument,

2:11:00.400 --> 2:11:01.920
 there's not an argument, it's a statement,

2:11:01.920 --> 2:11:05.440
 but strange things happen all the time.

2:11:05.440 --> 2:11:06.280
 No, I agree.

2:11:06.280 --> 2:11:09.160
 It doesn't mean that logic doesn't apply

2:11:09.160 --> 2:11:11.400
 and probabilities don't apply, but we all,

2:11:11.400 --> 2:11:16.400
 I mean, in general principle, everyone, if we were honest,

2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:19.000
 should be agnostic about everything.

2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:23.520
 Like I think I'm Jamie, but is there a 0.01% chance

2:11:23.520 --> 2:11:27.200
 or 0.001% chance that I'm not?

2:11:27.200 --> 2:11:28.200
 But it could be.

2:11:28.200 --> 2:11:29.040
 I mean, how would I know?

2:11:29.040 --> 2:11:30.360
 But there's a large number of people arguing

2:11:30.360 --> 2:11:31.880
 about the meaning of the word I

2:11:31.880 --> 2:11:33.080
 and that I'm Jamie.

2:11:33.080 --> 2:11:33.920
 So exactly.

2:11:33.920 --> 2:11:34.760
 What is consciousness?

2:11:34.760 --> 2:11:35.600
 Exactly, exactly.

2:11:35.600 --> 2:11:39.160
 So we could spend another three hours going into that one.

2:11:39.160 --> 2:11:42.120
 So one possibility is there's some remote villager.

2:11:42.120 --> 2:11:47.120
 Another possibility is there's somehow bizarrely,

2:11:47.600 --> 2:11:49.040
 there are these infected animals

2:11:49.040 --> 2:11:52.120
 that come from Southern China most likely.

2:11:52.120 --> 2:11:55.800
 They all, maybe there's only one of them that's infected,

2:11:55.800 --> 2:11:58.080
 which how could that possibly be?

2:11:58.080 --> 2:11:59.840
 And it's only sent to Wuhan.

2:11:59.840 --> 2:12:02.840
 It's not sent anywhere else,

2:12:02.840 --> 2:12:04.160
 to any of the markets there or whatever.

2:12:04.160 --> 2:12:06.760
 And then maybe somebody in a market is infected.

2:12:06.760 --> 2:12:10.400
 That's one remote possibility, but a possibility.

2:12:10.400 --> 2:12:13.240
 Another is that researchers

2:12:13.240 --> 2:12:15.640
 from the Wuhan Institute of Virology

2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:17.520
 go down to Southern China.

2:12:17.520 --> 2:12:19.000
 We didn't, we haven't talked about it yet,

2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:22.960
 but in 2012, there were six miners were sent

2:12:22.960 --> 2:12:26.360
 into a copper mine in Southern China and Yunnan province.

2:12:26.360 --> 2:12:28.040
 All of them got very sick

2:12:28.040 --> 2:12:31.800
 with what now appear like COVID 19 like symptoms.

2:12:31.800 --> 2:12:34.280
 Half of them died.

2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:37.560
 Blood samples from them were taken

2:12:37.560 --> 2:12:40.720
 to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and elsewhere.

2:12:40.720 --> 2:12:45.720
 And then after that, there were multiple site visits

2:12:45.720 --> 2:12:49.400
 to that mine, collecting viral samples

2:12:49.400 --> 2:12:52.560
 that were brought to the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

2:12:52.560 --> 2:12:55.960
 included among those samples were,

2:12:55.960 --> 2:12:59.120
 was this now infamous RETG 13 virus,

2:12:59.120 --> 2:13:02.240
 which is among the genetically closest viruses

2:13:02.240 --> 2:13:03.880
 to SARS CoV2.

2:13:03.880 --> 2:13:07.360
 There were other nine other or eight other viruses

2:13:07.360 --> 2:13:08.960
 that were collected from that mine

2:13:08.960 --> 2:13:11.760
 that were presumably very similar to that.

2:13:11.760 --> 2:13:14.720
 And again, we have no access to the information

2:13:14.720 --> 2:13:17.920
 about those and many of the other,

2:13:17.920 --> 2:13:19.760
 most, almost all of the other viruses.

2:13:19.760 --> 2:13:24.120
 So could it be that one of the people

2:13:24.120 --> 2:13:26.280
 who was sent from the Wuhan Institute of Virology

2:13:26.280 --> 2:13:29.680
 or the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control,

2:13:29.680 --> 2:13:31.160
 they went down there to collect

2:13:31.160 --> 2:13:34.520
 and they got infected asymptomatically and brought it back?

2:13:34.520 --> 2:13:37.320
 Could it be that they were working on these viruses

2:13:37.320 --> 2:13:40.320
 in the laboratory and there was an issue

2:13:40.320 --> 2:13:41.800
 with waste disposal?

2:13:41.800 --> 2:13:45.120
 And we know that the Wuhan CDC had a major problem

2:13:45.120 --> 2:13:46.680
 with waste disposal.

2:13:46.680 --> 2:13:48.560
 And just before the pandemic,

2:13:48.560 --> 2:13:53.560
 one, they put out an RFP to fix their waste disposal.

2:13:53.720 --> 2:13:58.720
 And in early 2019, they moved to their new site,

2:13:59.120 --> 2:14:00.800
 which was basically across the street

2:14:00.800 --> 2:14:03.920
 from the Huanan Seafood Market.

2:14:03.920 --> 2:14:06.320
 So could there have been issue of somebody infected

2:14:06.320 --> 2:14:08.600
 in the lab of waste disposal?

2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:10.840
 Could a laboratory animal, their experiences

2:14:10.840 --> 2:14:13.200
 in China, actually China just recently passed a law

2:14:13.200 --> 2:14:17.120
 saying it's illegal to sell laboratory animals

2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:19.760
 in the market because there were scientists,

2:14:19.760 --> 2:14:23.160
 or one scientist who was selling laboratory animals

2:14:23.160 --> 2:14:27.280
 in the market and people would just come and buy.

2:14:27.280 --> 2:14:28.120
 It's insane.

2:14:28.120 --> 2:14:31.160
 So there's so many, there are so many scenarios,

2:14:31.160 --> 2:14:35.000
 but if I, again, connect it to my 85% number,

2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:39.880
 I think in the whole category of laboratory related incidents,

2:14:39.880 --> 2:14:42.120
 whether it's collection, waste,

2:14:42.120 --> 2:14:43.800
 something connected to the lab,

2:14:43.800 --> 2:14:46.720
 I think that's the most likely,

2:14:46.720 --> 2:14:49.200
 but there are other credible people

2:14:49.200 --> 2:14:52.040
 who would say they think it's not the most likely

2:14:52.040 --> 2:14:54.080
 and I welcome their views

2:14:54.080 --> 2:14:55.600
 and we need to have this conversation.

2:14:55.600 --> 2:14:59.560
 So in your write up, but what's the URL?

2:14:59.560 --> 2:15:03.640
 Because I always find it by doing Jamie Metzl lab leak.

2:15:03.640 --> 2:15:05.640
 It's probably the easiest, just Google that.

2:15:05.640 --> 2:15:08.120
 No, no, but if you just go to jamiemetzl.com,

2:15:08.120 --> 2:15:11.960
 J A M I E M E T Z L dot com,

2:15:11.960 --> 2:15:15.120
 then they're just a thing, it's COVID origins.

2:15:15.120 --> 2:15:17.000
 It's COVID origins.

2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:19.580
 Or you could just Google Jamie Metzl lab leak.

2:15:21.080 --> 2:15:23.160
 Google search engine is such a powerful thing.

2:15:23.160 --> 2:15:27.440
 You mentioned in that write up that you don't think,

2:15:27.440 --> 2:15:29.080
 this could be just me misreading it

2:15:29.080 --> 2:15:31.240
 or it's just slightly miswritten,

2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:34.720
 but you don't think that the virus

2:15:34.720 --> 2:15:38.120
 is from that 2012 mind, which is fascinating,

2:15:38.120 --> 2:15:40.800
 could be the backbone for SARS COVID too.

2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:43.800
 So what I mean, just the specific virus,

2:15:43.800 --> 2:15:45.920
 which I mentioned, RATG13,

2:15:45.920 --> 2:15:48.120
 and there's a whole history of that

2:15:48.120 --> 2:15:51.360
 because it had a different name and it looked,

2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:54.920
 and Xiaojiang Li provided wrong information

2:15:54.920 --> 2:15:57.200
 about when it had been sequenced.

2:15:57.200 --> 2:16:00.280
 I mean, there was a whole issue connected to that.

2:16:01.360 --> 2:16:02.880
 But the genetic difference,

2:16:02.880 --> 2:16:07.880
 even though it's 96.2% similar to the SARS COVID2 virus,

2:16:10.100 --> 2:16:12.400
 that's actually a significant difference,

2:16:12.400 --> 2:16:17.400
 even though that and a virus called Banal 52

2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:20.200
 that was collected in Laos are the two most similar,

2:16:20.200 --> 2:16:22.320
 there still are differences.

2:16:22.320 --> 2:16:25.720
 So I'm not saying RATG13 is the backbone,

2:16:25.720 --> 2:16:28.780
 but is there, I believe there is a possibility

2:16:28.780 --> 2:16:32.400
 that other viruses that were collected

2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:36.920
 either in that mine in Yunnan in Southern China

2:16:36.920 --> 2:16:39.360
 or in Laos or Cambodia,

2:16:39.360 --> 2:16:42.600
 because that was with the EcoHealth Alliance

2:16:43.600 --> 2:16:45.080
 proposals and documents.

2:16:45.080 --> 2:16:48.680
 Their plan was to collect viruses

2:16:48.680 --> 2:16:51.180
 in Laos and Cambodia and elsewhere

2:16:51.180 --> 2:16:54.260
 and bring them to the Wuhan Institute of Virology

2:16:54.260 --> 2:16:55.640
 so that there are people.

2:16:55.640 --> 2:16:57.200
 As a matter of fact, just when I was sitting here

2:16:57.200 --> 2:17:01.000
 before this interview,

2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:03.600
 I got a message from somebody who was saying,

2:17:03.600 --> 2:17:06.040
 well, Peter Daszak is telling everybody

2:17:06.040 --> 2:17:10.120
 that the viral sample, the Banal 52 from Laos

2:17:10.120 --> 2:17:13.720
 proves that there's not a lab incident origin

2:17:13.720 --> 2:17:14.560
 of the pandemic.

2:17:14.560 --> 2:17:17.060
 And it actually doesn't prove that at all

2:17:17.060 --> 2:17:20.520
 because these viruses were being collected

2:17:20.520 --> 2:17:24.120
 in places like Laos and Cambodia

2:17:24.120 --> 2:17:28.400
 and being brought to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

2:17:28.400 --> 2:17:32.800
 Those are like early, early, like the prequel.

2:17:32.800 --> 2:17:35.760
 So these are, they're not sufficiently similar

2:17:35.760 --> 2:17:37.400
 to be a, to serve as a backbone,

2:17:37.400 --> 2:17:38.680
 but they kind of tell a story

2:17:38.680 --> 2:17:40.640
 that they could have been brought to the lab

2:17:40.640 --> 2:17:44.980
 through several processes, including genetic modification

2:17:44.980 --> 2:17:47.560
 or through the natural evolution processes,

2:17:47.560 --> 2:17:49.680
 accelerated evolution, they could have arrived

2:17:49.680 --> 2:17:52.880
 to something that has the spike protein

2:17:52.880 --> 2:17:56.120
 and the cleavage, the foreign cleavage site

2:17:56.120 --> 2:17:56.960
 and all that kind of stuff.

2:17:56.960 --> 2:18:00.200
 So what I'm saying is the essential point

2:18:00.200 --> 2:18:03.440
 is if we had access, if we knew everything

2:18:03.440 --> 2:18:05.960
 that was being, every virus that was being held

2:18:05.960 --> 2:18:09.280
 at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Wuhan CDC,

2:18:09.280 --> 2:18:10.640
 we had full access.

2:18:10.640 --> 2:18:13.840
 We had full access to everybody's lab notes.

2:18:13.840 --> 2:18:16.720
 And we did just the kind of forensic investigation

2:18:16.720 --> 2:18:21.360
 that has been so desperately required since day one.

2:18:21.360 --> 2:18:24.340
 We'd be able to say, well, what did you have?

2:18:24.340 --> 2:18:26.940
 Because if we knew, if it should come out,

2:18:26.940 --> 2:18:30.760
 that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had in its repository,

2:18:30.760 --> 2:18:34.040
 prior to the outbreak, either SARS CoV2

2:18:34.040 --> 2:18:36.640
 or a reasonable precursor to it,

2:18:36.640 --> 2:18:39.480
 that would prove the lab incident hypothesis.

2:18:39.480 --> 2:18:42.920
 In my mind, that's almost certainly why they are preventing

2:18:42.920 --> 2:18:46.140
 any kind of meaningful investigation.

2:18:46.140 --> 2:18:51.140
 So my hypothesis is not that what RITG13 says

2:18:51.840 --> 2:18:54.480
 is because as I mentioned earlier,

2:18:54.480 --> 2:18:58.740
 the genetics of virus are constantly recombinating.

2:18:59.640 --> 2:19:01.880
 So that what that means is if you have,

2:19:01.880 --> 2:19:06.080
 you don't have very many total outlier viruses

2:19:06.080 --> 2:19:08.660
 in a bat community because these viruses

2:19:08.660 --> 2:19:11.240
 are always mixing and matching with each other.

2:19:11.240 --> 2:19:16.080
 And so if you have RITG13, which is relatively similar

2:19:16.080 --> 2:19:19.160
 to SARS CoV2, there's a pretty decent likelihood

2:19:19.160 --> 2:19:22.680
 there was other stuff that was collected

2:19:22.680 --> 2:19:27.680
 at this mine called Mojang Mine in Yunnan Province,

2:19:28.320 --> 2:19:30.940
 maybe in Laos and Cambodia.

2:19:30.940 --> 2:19:34.060
 And that's why we need to have that information.

2:19:36.300 --> 2:19:39.120
 Do you think somebody knows who patient zero is

2:19:39.120 --> 2:19:39.960
 within China?

2:19:39.960 --> 2:19:40.880
 So do you think that is?

2:19:40.880 --> 2:19:42.080
 Well, there's two things.

2:19:42.080 --> 2:19:45.600
 One is I think somebody and people probably know.

2:19:45.600 --> 2:19:47.740
 And then two, it's been incredibly curious

2:19:47.740 --> 2:19:52.400
 that the best virus chasers in the world are in China.

2:19:52.400 --> 2:19:54.520
 And they are in Wuhan.

2:19:54.520 --> 2:19:58.680
 And when we can talk about this deeply compromised,

2:19:58.680 --> 2:20:03.180
 now vastly improved World Health Organization process.

2:20:03.180 --> 2:20:05.440
 But when they went there, the Chinese,

2:20:05.440 --> 2:20:07.440
 the local and national Chinese authorities say,

2:20:07.440 --> 2:20:10.640
 oh, we haven't done, we haven't tested the samples

2:20:10.640 --> 2:20:11.920
 in our blood center.

2:20:11.920 --> 2:20:13.600
 We haven't done any of this tracing.

2:20:13.600 --> 2:20:16.880
 And these deeply compromised people

2:20:16.880 --> 2:20:20.880
 who were part of the international part

2:20:20.880 --> 2:20:25.080
 of the joint study tour, when they came out with their,

2:20:25.080 --> 2:20:26.480
 they had their visit earlier this year

2:20:26.480 --> 2:20:28.100
 and came out with their report.

2:20:28.100 --> 2:20:32.200
 They had in my mind, just an absurd letter

2:20:32.200 --> 2:20:34.180
 to the editor in nature saying,

2:20:34.180 --> 2:20:35.760
 well, if we don't hurry back,

2:20:35.760 --> 2:20:37.480
 we're not gonna know what happened.

2:20:37.480 --> 2:20:41.460
 Assuming that the people in China are like bumpkins

2:20:41.460 --> 2:20:44.080
 who on their own don't know how to trace the origin

2:20:44.080 --> 2:20:47.460
 of a virus and the opposite is the case.

2:20:47.460 --> 2:20:50.000
 So I think there are people in China

2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:51.960
 who at least know a lot.

2:20:51.960 --> 2:20:55.160
 They know a lot more than they're saying.

2:20:55.160 --> 2:20:59.000
 And at the best case scenario is the Chinese government

2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:03.240
 wants to prevent any investigation, including by them.

2:21:03.240 --> 2:21:06.520
 The worst case scenario is that there are people

2:21:06.520 --> 2:21:07.340
 who already know.

2:21:07.340 --> 2:21:10.320
 And that's why, again, my point from day one has been,

2:21:10.320 --> 2:21:14.800
 we need a comprehensive international investigation

2:21:14.800 --> 2:21:18.280
 in Wuhan with full access to all relevant records,

2:21:18.280 --> 2:21:19.360
 samples and personnel.

2:21:19.360 --> 2:21:22.160
 When this, again, deeply flawed.

2:21:22.160 --> 2:21:27.160
 Can I give you a little history of this WHO process?

2:21:27.200 --> 2:21:28.280
 Okay.

2:21:28.280 --> 2:21:30.560
 Who are the, that's funny.

2:21:32.360 --> 2:21:33.520
 Who's on first?

2:21:33.520 --> 2:21:34.440
 Who's on first?

2:21:34.440 --> 2:21:36.400
 I'm so funny with the jokes.

2:21:36.400 --> 2:21:37.240
 Look at me go.

2:21:38.200 --> 2:21:39.760
 Who are the WHO?

2:21:39.760 --> 2:21:41.460
 So what is this organization?

2:21:41.460 --> 2:21:43.080
 What is its purpose?

2:21:43.080 --> 2:21:45.920
 What role did it play in the pandemic?

2:21:45.920 --> 2:21:49.520
 It certainly was demonized in the realm of politics.

2:21:49.520 --> 2:21:54.520
 This is an institution that was supposed to save us

2:21:55.080 --> 2:21:57.080
 from this pandemic.

2:21:57.080 --> 2:21:58.960
 A lot of people believe it failed.

2:21:58.960 --> 2:22:00.280
 Has it failed?

2:22:00.280 --> 2:22:01.680
 Why did it fail?

2:22:01.680 --> 2:22:02.960
 And you said it's improving.

2:22:02.960 --> 2:22:04.280
 How is it improving?

2:22:04.280 --> 2:22:05.120
 Great.

2:22:05.120 --> 2:22:05.940
 All right.

2:22:05.940 --> 2:22:06.780
 I hope you don't mind.

2:22:06.780 --> 2:22:08.840
 I'm gonna have to talk for a little bit of extra time.

2:22:08.840 --> 2:22:09.680
 I love this.

2:22:09.680 --> 2:22:10.520
 I love this.

2:22:10.520 --> 2:22:12.080
 Good, good, good, good.

2:22:12.080 --> 2:22:16.200
 So the WHO is an absolutely essential organization

2:22:16.200 --> 2:22:20.580
 created in 1948 in that wonderful period

2:22:20.580 --> 2:22:22.200
 after the Second World War

2:22:22.200 --> 2:22:24.540
 when the United States and allied countries

2:22:24.540 --> 2:22:27.200
 asked the big bold questions,

2:22:27.200 --> 2:22:30.640
 how do we build a safer world for everyone?

2:22:30.640 --> 2:22:33.340
 And so that's the WHO.

2:22:33.340 --> 2:22:36.780
 If we, although there are many critics of the WHO,

2:22:36.780 --> 2:22:39.120
 if we didn't have it, we would need to invent it

2:22:39.120 --> 2:22:44.120
 because the whole nature of these big public health issues

2:22:44.120 --> 2:22:48.280
 and certainly for pandemics, but all sorts of things

2:22:48.280 --> 2:22:50.880
 is that they are transnational in nature.

2:22:50.880 --> 2:22:54.160
 And so we cannot just build moats.

2:22:54.160 --> 2:22:55.700
 We cannot build walls.

2:22:55.700 --> 2:22:56.960
 We're all connected to it.

2:22:56.960 --> 2:22:59.540
 So that's the idea.

2:22:59.540 --> 2:23:02.760
 There's a political process because the United Nations

2:23:02.760 --> 2:23:04.480
 and the WHO is part of it,

2:23:06.480 --> 2:23:08.840
 it exists within a political context.

2:23:08.840 --> 2:23:11.640
 And so the current director general

2:23:11.640 --> 2:23:13.120
 of the World Health Organization

2:23:13.120 --> 2:23:16.880
 who was just reelected for his second five year term

2:23:16.880 --> 2:23:20.220
 is Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus

2:23:20.220 --> 2:23:25.220
 who is from Ethiopia, Tigrayan from Ethiopia.

2:23:25.220 --> 2:23:30.220
 And in full disclosure, I have a lot of respect for Tedros.

2:23:31.100 --> 2:23:33.260
 Tedros got his job.

2:23:33.260 --> 2:23:35.360
 He was not America's candidate.

2:23:35.360 --> 2:23:37.160
 He was not Britain's candidate.

2:23:37.160 --> 2:23:39.920
 Our candidate was a guy named David Nabarro

2:23:39.920 --> 2:23:42.700
 who I also know and have tremendous respect for.

2:23:43.720 --> 2:23:48.720
 China led the process of putting Tedros in this position.

2:23:50.560 --> 2:23:54.520
 And in the earliest days of the pandemic,

2:23:54.520 --> 2:23:55.920
 Tedros, in my view,

2:23:55.920 --> 2:23:57.760
 even though I have tremendous respect for him,

2:23:57.760 --> 2:23:59.280
 I think he made a mistake.

2:23:59.280 --> 2:24:02.240
 The WHO doesn't have its own

2:24:02.240 --> 2:24:04.240
 independent surveillance network.

2:24:04.240 --> 2:24:05.760
 It's not organized to have it

2:24:05.760 --> 2:24:07.200
 and the states have not allowed it.

2:24:07.200 --> 2:24:10.240
 So it's dependent on member states

2:24:10.240 --> 2:24:13.120
 for providing it information.

2:24:13.120 --> 2:24:17.060
 And because it's a poorly funded organization

2:24:17.060 --> 2:24:20.460
 dependent on its bosses who are these governments,

2:24:20.460 --> 2:24:24.680
 it's natural instinct isn't to condemn its bosses.

2:24:24.680 --> 2:24:28.240
 It's to say, well, let's quietly work with everybody.

2:24:28.240 --> 2:24:29.360
 Having said that,

2:24:29.360 --> 2:24:33.280
 the Chinese government knowingly lied to Tedros.

2:24:33.280 --> 2:24:36.360
 And Tedros, in repeating the position

2:24:36.360 --> 2:24:37.200
 of the Chinese government,

2:24:37.200 --> 2:24:39.400
 which incidentally I'll say Donald Trump

2:24:39.400 --> 2:24:41.160
 also did the exact same thing.

2:24:41.160 --> 2:24:43.920
 Donald Trump had a private conversation with Xi Jinping

2:24:43.920 --> 2:24:48.520
 and then repeated what Xi had told him.

2:24:48.520 --> 2:24:50.420
 Both of them were wrong.

2:24:51.400 --> 2:24:55.840
 Dr. Tedros, I think when Chinese government was lying,

2:24:55.840 --> 2:24:56.920
 knowingly lying,

2:24:56.920 --> 2:25:00.000
 saying there's no human to human transmission,

2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:01.100
 Dr. Tedros said that.

2:25:01.100 --> 2:25:04.820
 And even though within the World Health Organization,

2:25:04.820 --> 2:25:07.280
 there were private critiques saying

2:25:07.280 --> 2:25:10.500
 China is now doing exactly what it did in SARS one,

2:25:10.500 --> 2:25:11.920
 it's not providing access,

2:25:11.920 --> 2:25:13.920
 it's not providing information.

2:25:13.920 --> 2:25:16.680
 Tedros's instinct because of his background,

2:25:16.680 --> 2:25:21.000
 because of his role and wrongly,

2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:25.540
 was to have a more collaborative relationship with China,

2:25:25.540 --> 2:25:28.400
 particularly by making assertions

2:25:28.400 --> 2:25:30.360
 based on the information that was wrong.

2:25:30.360 --> 2:25:32.120
 Don't call people liars,

2:25:32.120 --> 2:25:33.840
 they're not gonna be happy with you.

2:25:33.840 --> 2:25:34.680
 They're not gonna be happy.

2:25:34.680 --> 2:25:38.880
 And the job of the WHO isn't to condemn states,

2:25:38.880 --> 2:25:41.920
 it's to do the best possible job of addressing problems.

2:25:41.920 --> 2:25:43.720
 And I think that the culture was,

2:25:43.720 --> 2:25:45.840
 well, let's do the most that we can.

2:25:45.840 --> 2:25:49.260
 If we totally alienate China on day one,

2:25:49.260 --> 2:25:52.600
 we're in even worse shape than if we call them out for.

2:25:52.600 --> 2:25:54.280
 Not exactly sure, by the way,

2:25:54.280 --> 2:25:58.160
 that maybe you can also steel man that argument.

2:25:58.160 --> 2:26:00.520
 Like it's not completely obvious that that's

2:26:00.520 --> 2:26:02.840
 a terrible decision.

2:26:02.840 --> 2:26:05.480
 Like if you and I were in that role,

2:26:05.480 --> 2:26:06.880
 we wouldn't make that decision.

2:26:06.880 --> 2:26:09.240
 It's complicated because like,

2:26:09.240 --> 2:26:11.760
 you want China on your side to help solve this.

2:26:11.760 --> 2:26:14.500
 So I would have made a different decision,

2:26:14.500 --> 2:26:17.560
 which is why I never would have been selected

2:26:17.560 --> 2:26:18.680
 as the director general.

2:26:18.680 --> 2:26:20.640
 There's a selection criteria

2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:24.360
 that everybody kind of needs to support you.

2:26:24.360 --> 2:26:27.120
 And so, but let me just, this is just the beginning.

2:26:27.120 --> 2:26:30.880
 Can you also just elaborate or kind of restate,

2:26:30.880 --> 2:26:34.320
 what were the inaccuracies that you quickly mentioned?

2:26:34.320 --> 2:26:36.720
 So human to human transmission, what were the things?

2:26:36.720 --> 2:26:41.360
 So the most important, there were a few things.

2:26:41.360 --> 2:26:46.360
 One, China didn't report the outbreak.

2:26:46.400 --> 2:26:49.840
 Two, they had the sequenced genome

2:26:49.840 --> 2:26:51.980
 of the SARS CoV2 virus,

2:26:51.980 --> 2:26:55.880
 and they didn't share it for two critical weeks.

2:26:55.880 --> 2:26:59.280
 And when they did share it, it was inadvertent.

2:26:59.280 --> 2:27:01.780
 I mean, there was a very, very courageous scientist

2:27:01.780 --> 2:27:04.800
 who essentially leaked it and was later punished

2:27:04.800 --> 2:27:06.500
 for leaking it, even though the Chinese government

2:27:06.500 --> 2:27:09.640
 is now saying we were so great by releasing the sequenced.

2:27:09.640 --> 2:27:10.840
 Wait, I was really confused.

2:27:10.840 --> 2:27:11.680
 Really?

2:27:11.680 --> 2:27:15.080
 So I'm so clueless about this as most things.

2:27:15.080 --> 2:27:19.340
 Because I thought, because there was a celebration of,

2:27:19.340 --> 2:27:23.480
 isn't this amazing that we got the sequence,

2:27:23.480 --> 2:27:27.200
 that's amazing, and then the scientific community

2:27:27.200 --> 2:27:30.120
 across the world stepped up and were able to do

2:27:30.120 --> 2:27:32.240
 a lot of stuff really quickly with that sharing.

2:27:32.240 --> 2:27:34.500
 Because I thought the Chinese government shared it.

2:27:34.500 --> 2:27:37.000
 No, no, so they sat on it for two weeks.

2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:40.640
 When they shared it against their will, it was incredible.

2:27:40.640 --> 2:27:45.440
 Moderna, 48 hours later after getting the information,

2:27:45.440 --> 2:27:48.200
 getting the sequenced genome, they had the formulation

2:27:48.200 --> 2:27:51.960
 for what's now the Moderna COVID 19 vaccine.

2:27:51.960 --> 2:27:55.240
 But that's two critical weeks.

2:27:55.240 --> 2:27:59.320
 In those early days, they blocked the World Health

2:27:59.320 --> 2:28:03.440
 Organization from sending its experts to Wuhan

2:28:03.440 --> 2:28:04.940
 for more than three weeks.

2:28:04.940 --> 2:28:08.160
 I said they lied about human to human transmission.

2:28:08.160 --> 2:28:11.160
 During that time, they were aggressively enacting

2:28:11.160 --> 2:28:15.880
 their coverup, destroying records, hiding samples,

2:28:15.880 --> 2:28:19.640
 imprisoning people who were asking tough questions.

2:28:19.640 --> 2:28:24.100
 They soon after established their gag order.

2:28:24.100 --> 2:28:27.880
 They fought internally in the World Health Organization

2:28:27.880 --> 2:28:32.080
 to prevent the declaration of a global emergency.

2:28:32.080 --> 2:28:36.120
 So China definitely, I mean, I couldn't be stronger

2:28:36.120 --> 2:28:40.040
 in my critique of China, particularly what it did

2:28:40.040 --> 2:28:42.320
 in those early days, but it really, what it's doing

2:28:42.320 --> 2:28:44.520
 even to today is outrageous.

2:28:44.520 --> 2:28:48.080
 So that was, so then there was the question of,

2:28:48.080 --> 2:28:51.280
 well, how do we examine what actually happened?

2:28:51.280 --> 2:28:54.280
 And the Prime Minister of Australia then and now,

2:28:54.280 --> 2:28:57.000
 Scott Morrison, was incredibly courageous.

2:28:57.000 --> 2:28:59.620
 And he said, we need a full investigation.

2:28:59.620 --> 2:29:02.120
 And because of that, the Chinese government

2:29:02.120 --> 2:29:05.920
 attacked him personally and imposed trade sanctions

2:29:05.920 --> 2:29:09.660
 on Australia to try to, not just to punish Australia,

2:29:09.660 --> 2:29:12.160
 but to deliver a message to every other country.

2:29:12.160 --> 2:29:15.880
 If you ask questions, we're going to punish you ruthlessly.

2:29:15.880 --> 2:29:19.680
 And then that certainly was the message that was delivered.

2:29:21.360 --> 2:29:24.800
 The Australians brought that idea of a full investigation

2:29:24.800 --> 2:29:28.400
 to the World Health Assembly in May of 2020.

2:29:28.400 --> 2:29:32.240
 As I mentioned before, the WHA is the governing authority

2:29:32.240 --> 2:29:36.520
 above, of states above the World Health Organization.

2:29:36.520 --> 2:29:40.600
 And so, but instead of passing a resolution calling

2:29:40.600 --> 2:29:44.560
 for a full investigation, what ended up ironically

2:29:44.560 --> 2:29:48.320
 and tragically passing with Chinese support

2:29:48.320 --> 2:29:50.480
 was a mandate to have essentially

2:29:50.480 --> 2:29:54.040
 a Chinese controlled joint study,

2:29:54.040 --> 2:29:56.640
 where half of the team, a little more than half of the team

2:29:56.640 --> 2:29:59.480
 was Chinese experts, government affiliated Chinese experts,

2:29:59.480 --> 2:30:04.160
 and half were independent international experts

2:30:04.160 --> 2:30:08.360
 but organized by the WHO.

2:30:08.360 --> 2:30:10.080
 And then it took six months

2:30:10.080 --> 2:30:12.400
 to negotiate the terms of reference.

2:30:12.400 --> 2:30:14.960
 And again, while China was doing all this coverup,

2:30:14.960 --> 2:30:16.720
 they delayed and delayed and delayed.

2:30:16.720 --> 2:30:19.480
 And by the terms of reference that were negotiated,

2:30:19.480 --> 2:30:22.960
 China had veto power over who got to be a member

2:30:22.960 --> 2:30:25.840
 of the international group.

2:30:25.840 --> 2:30:30.840
 And that group was not entitled to access to raw data.

2:30:31.160 --> 2:30:34.760
 The Chinese side would give them conclusions

2:30:34.760 --> 2:30:37.640
 based on their own analysis of the raw data,

2:30:37.640 --> 2:30:39.880
 which was totally outrageous.

2:30:39.880 --> 2:30:43.400
 So then, and I was a big, I and others,

2:30:43.400 --> 2:30:46.160
 now friend of mine, although we've never met in person,

2:30:46.160 --> 2:30:48.080
 Gilles de Manouf in New Zealand,

2:30:48.080 --> 2:30:51.560
 he did a great job of chronicling just the letter by letter

2:30:51.560 --> 2:30:53.520
 of the terms of reference.

2:30:54.400 --> 2:30:59.160
 So then it took, now it's the January of this year,

2:30:59.160 --> 2:31:02.480
 January, 2021, this deeply flawed,

2:31:02.480 --> 2:31:07.480
 deeply compromised international group is sent to Wuhan.

2:31:07.480 --> 2:31:09.440
 So what's the connection between this group

2:31:09.440 --> 2:31:10.320
 and the joint study?

2:31:10.320 --> 2:31:12.280
 So the joint study, it had the Chinese side

2:31:12.280 --> 2:31:13.440
 and the international side.

2:31:13.440 --> 2:31:15.480
 So these international experts,

2:31:15.480 --> 2:31:18.200
 then part of their examination was going

2:31:18.200 --> 2:31:19.880
 for one month to Wuhan.

2:31:19.880 --> 2:31:23.240
 And the nature of the flaws of this international group.

2:31:23.240 --> 2:31:24.920
 It's okay, really important point.

2:31:24.920 --> 2:31:26.840
 And I'm sorry, I wasn't clear on that.

2:31:26.840 --> 2:31:31.000
 Rather, the mandate of what they were doing

2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:34.920
 was not to investigate the origins of the pandemic.

2:31:34.920 --> 2:31:37.640
 It was to have a joint study

2:31:37.640 --> 2:31:40.360
 into the zoonotic origins of the virus,

2:31:40.360 --> 2:31:43.680
 which means, which was interpreted to mean

2:31:43.680 --> 2:31:45.600
 the natural origins hypothesis.

2:31:45.600 --> 2:31:48.760
 They weren't empowered for a single hypothesis,

2:31:48.760 --> 2:31:51.240
 not so that they weren't empowered

2:31:51.240 --> 2:31:54.080
 to examine the lab incident origin.

2:31:54.080 --> 2:31:56.960
 They were there to look at the natural origin hypothesis.

2:31:56.960 --> 2:31:58.840
 To shop for some meat at some markets.

2:31:58.840 --> 2:32:03.560
 Yeah, so that was, so then they were there for a month.

2:32:03.560 --> 2:32:04.400
 Yeah.

2:32:04.400 --> 2:32:09.400
 So out of the makeup of the team, guess who was?

2:32:09.680 --> 2:32:12.800
 So the United States government proposed three experts

2:32:12.800 --> 2:32:13.640
 for this team.

2:32:13.640 --> 2:32:15.280
 People who had a lot of background.

2:32:15.280 --> 2:32:17.240
 This was the Trump administration.

2:32:17.240 --> 2:32:19.720
 People who had a lot of background,

2:32:19.720 --> 2:32:23.000
 including in investigating lab incidents.

2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:24.840
 None of those people were accepted.

2:32:24.840 --> 2:32:27.200
 The one American who was accepted.

2:32:27.200 --> 2:32:28.160
 Don't tell me it's Peter Daszak.

2:32:28.160 --> 2:32:29.120
 Peter Daszak.

2:32:29.120 --> 2:32:33.200
 Peter Daszak, who had this funding relationship

2:32:33.200 --> 2:32:35.600
 for many years with the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

2:32:35.600 --> 2:32:39.400
 whose entire basically professional reputation

2:32:39.400 --> 2:32:43.240
 was based on his collaboration with Shujang Li,

2:32:43.240 --> 2:32:47.680
 who had written the February, 2020 Lancet letter

2:32:47.680 --> 2:32:49.520
 saying it comes from natural origin.

2:32:49.520 --> 2:32:51.720
 And anybody who's suggesting otherwise

2:32:51.720 --> 2:32:53.320
 is a conspiracy theorist.

2:32:53.320 --> 2:32:55.280
 And who, at least according to me,

2:32:55.280 --> 2:33:00.200
 had been at very, very least the opposite of transparent

2:33:00.200 --> 2:33:03.400
 and at most engaged in a massive disinformation campaign.

2:33:03.400 --> 2:33:07.800
 He is the one American who's on this.

2:33:07.800 --> 2:33:10.880
 So they go there, they have one month in Wuhan.

2:33:10.880 --> 2:33:14.280
 Two weeks of it are spent in quarantine

2:33:14.280 --> 2:33:15.960
 just in their hotel rooms.

2:33:15.960 --> 2:33:17.560
 So then they have two weeks,

2:33:17.560 --> 2:33:20.120
 but really it's just 10 working days.

2:33:20.120 --> 2:33:22.640
 One of the earliest, and so then they're kind of,

2:33:22.640 --> 2:33:23.640
 we've all seen the pictures.

2:33:23.640 --> 2:33:27.520
 They're traveling around Wuhan in little buses.

2:33:27.520 --> 2:33:30.480
 One of the first visits they have

2:33:30.480 --> 2:33:33.840
 is to this museum exhibition on the,

2:33:33.840 --> 2:33:37.680
 it's basically a propaganda exhibition on the success,

2:33:37.680 --> 2:33:40.320
 Xi Jinping and the success in fighting COVID.

2:33:40.320 --> 2:33:41.960
 And they said, well, we had to show respect

2:33:41.960 --> 2:33:42.800
 to our Chinese hosts.

2:33:42.800 --> 2:33:44.640
 But I think what the Chinese hosts were saying is,

2:33:44.640 --> 2:33:47.200
 let's just, I'm just gonna rub your noses in this.

2:33:47.200 --> 2:33:48.840
 You're gonna go where we tell you.

2:33:48.840 --> 2:33:53.160
 You're gonna hear what we want you to hear.

2:33:53.160 --> 2:33:54.360
 So they have that little short time.

2:33:54.360 --> 2:33:56.240
 They spend a few hours.

2:33:56.240 --> 2:33:59.320
 They weren't in control of where the bus goes.

2:33:59.320 --> 2:34:01.960
 No, I mean, they made recommendations.

2:34:01.960 --> 2:34:05.240
 Many of their recommendations were accepted,

2:34:05.240 --> 2:34:08.800
 but like when they went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology

2:34:08.800 --> 2:34:10.440
 and some of them did,

2:34:10.440 --> 2:34:13.040
 they weren't able to do any kind of audit

2:34:13.040 --> 2:34:15.600
 when they asked for access to raw data.

2:34:15.600 --> 2:34:18.680
 They weren't provided that.

2:34:18.680 --> 2:34:22.600
 They were, it was, as I said in my 60 minutes interview,

2:34:22.600 --> 2:34:24.960
 it was a chaperoned study tour.

2:34:24.960 --> 2:34:27.840
 It was not even remotely close to an investigation.

2:34:27.840 --> 2:34:29.320
 And the thing they were looking at

2:34:29.320 --> 2:34:32.160
 wasn't the origins of the pandemic.

2:34:32.160 --> 2:34:34.680
 It was the single hypothesis

2:34:34.680 --> 2:34:39.000
 of a quote unquote natural origins.

2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:43.200
 Then, I mean, it was really so shocking for me.

2:34:43.200 --> 2:34:46.720
 On February 9 of this year in Wuhan,

2:34:46.720 --> 2:34:51.000
 the Chinese government sets up a joint press event

2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:55.040
 where it's the Chinese side and the international side.

2:34:55.040 --> 2:34:58.000
 And during that press event,

2:34:58.000 --> 2:34:59.880
 a guy named Peter Ben Embarek,

2:34:59.880 --> 2:35:00.800
 and it's a little confusing.

2:35:00.800 --> 2:35:04.160
 He was basically the head of this delegation

2:35:04.160 --> 2:35:06.160
 and he works for the WHO,

2:35:06.160 --> 2:35:09.440
 even though this was an independent committee,

2:35:09.440 --> 2:35:11.720
 it was organized by the WHO.

2:35:11.720 --> 2:35:16.160
 So Peter Ben Embarek gets up there and says,

2:35:16.160 --> 2:35:19.320
 we think it's most likely it comes from nature.

2:35:19.320 --> 2:35:22.080
 Then he says, we think it's possible

2:35:22.080 --> 2:35:23.720
 it comes through frozen food,

2:35:23.720 --> 2:35:25.880
 which is absolutely outrageous.

2:35:25.880 --> 2:35:27.800
 I mean, it's basically preposterous.

2:35:27.800 --> 2:35:32.200
 Alena Chan calls this popsicle origins,

2:35:32.200 --> 2:35:34.360
 but it's really, really unlikely.

2:35:34.360 --> 2:35:36.760
 But then most significantly,

2:35:36.760 --> 2:35:39.960
 he says that we've all agreed

2:35:40.960 --> 2:35:43.360
 that a lab incident origin is quote unquote

2:35:43.360 --> 2:35:47.800
 extremely unlikely and shouldn't be investigated.

2:35:47.800 --> 2:35:50.720
 We later learned that the way they came up

2:35:50.720 --> 2:35:54.480
 with that determination was by a show of hands vote

2:35:54.480 --> 2:35:57.920
 of the international experts and the Chinese experts.

2:35:57.920 --> 2:36:00.600
 And the Chinese experts had to do their vote

2:36:00.600 --> 2:36:03.280
 in front of the Chinese government officials

2:36:03.280 --> 2:36:05.480
 who were constantly there.

2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:07.320
 So even if whatever they thought,

2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:09.800
 there was no possibility that someone raises their hand

2:36:09.800 --> 2:36:12.280
 and say, oh yeah, I think it's a lab origin.

2:36:12.280 --> 2:36:15.200
 So that was outrageous thing number one.

2:36:15.200 --> 2:36:16.480
 Outrageous thing number two,

2:36:16.480 --> 2:36:21.040
 which I mean, I'll come back to my response in February.

2:36:21.040 --> 2:36:24.320
 Outrageous thing number two is months later,

2:36:24.320 --> 2:36:27.960
 Peter Benambarak does an interview on Danish television.

2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:32.560
 And he says, actually I was lying about extremely unlikely

2:36:32.560 --> 2:36:34.320
 because the Chinese side,

2:36:34.320 --> 2:36:38.120
 they didn't want any mention of a lab incident origin

2:36:38.120 --> 2:36:42.480
 anywhere including in the report that later came out.

2:36:42.480 --> 2:36:46.200
 And so the deal we made, even though he himself thought

2:36:46.200 --> 2:36:49.040
 that at least some manifestation of a lab incident origin

2:36:49.040 --> 2:36:53.200
 was likely and that there should be an investigation,

2:36:53.200 --> 2:36:54.800
 particularly he said, well, that's kind of weird

2:36:54.800 --> 2:36:57.280
 that the Wuhan CDC moved just across

2:36:57.280 --> 2:36:59.360
 from the Huanan seafood market

2:36:59.360 --> 2:37:03.920
 just before the beginning of the pandemic.

2:37:03.920 --> 2:37:06.680
 But he said as a horse trading deal

2:37:06.680 --> 2:37:08.480
 with the Chinese authorities,

2:37:08.480 --> 2:37:12.320
 it shouldn't be that he agreed to say

2:37:12.320 --> 2:37:15.280
 it was extremely unlikely and shouldn't be investigated.

2:37:15.280 --> 2:37:18.840
 So I was in actually in Colorado staying with my parents

2:37:18.840 --> 2:37:23.240
 and I stayed up late watching this press event.

2:37:23.240 --> 2:37:25.960
 And I was appalled because I knew after two weeks

2:37:25.960 --> 2:37:29.680
 there was no way they could possibly come to that conclusion.

2:37:29.680 --> 2:37:33.560
 So I immediately sent a private message to Tedros,

2:37:33.560 --> 2:37:37.440
 the WHO director general, essentially saying

2:37:37.440 --> 2:37:40.200
 there's no way they had enough access

2:37:40.200 --> 2:37:42.440
 to come to this conclusion.

2:37:42.440 --> 2:37:47.280
 If the WHO doesn't distance itself from this,

2:37:47.280 --> 2:37:49.880
 the WHO itself is going to be in danger

2:37:49.880 --> 2:37:53.160
 because it's going to be basically institutional capture

2:37:53.160 --> 2:37:54.000
 by the Chinese.

2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:56.400
 This was repeating the Chinese government's

2:37:56.400 --> 2:37:57.640
 propaganda points.

2:37:57.640 --> 2:38:00.760
 And Tedros sent me a really, again,

2:38:00.760 --> 2:38:02.080
 why I have so much respect for Tedros,

2:38:02.080 --> 2:38:04.320
 sent me a private note saying,

2:38:04.320 --> 2:38:08.440
 don't worry, we are determined to do the right thing.

2:38:08.440 --> 2:38:10.000
 And so I got that private message.

2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:11.880
 And again, I really like Tedros,

2:38:11.880 --> 2:38:14.760
 but I thought, well, what are you gonna do?

2:38:14.760 --> 2:38:19.120
 Three days later, Tedros makes a public statement.

2:38:19.120 --> 2:38:23.000
 And he says, I've heard this thing.

2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:25.400
 I don't think that this is a final answer.

2:38:25.400 --> 2:38:29.320
 We need to have a full investigation into this process.

2:38:29.320 --> 2:38:32.800
 He then released two more statements

2:38:32.800 --> 2:38:37.280
 saying we need to have a full investigation

2:38:37.280 --> 2:38:38.520
 with access to raw data.

2:38:38.520 --> 2:38:42.840
 And we need a full audit of the Wuhan labs.

2:38:42.840 --> 2:38:46.360
 So then that part was really, really great.

2:38:46.360 --> 2:38:49.200
 But then this saga continues because,

2:38:49.200 --> 2:38:51.760
 so I was part of a group, as I mentioned before,

2:38:51.760 --> 2:38:53.480
 this Paris group.

2:38:53.480 --> 2:38:55.600
 It was about two dozen or so experts.

2:38:55.600 --> 2:39:00.000
 And we'd been meeting since 2020 and having regular meetings.

2:39:00.000 --> 2:39:02.200
 And we just present papers, present data,

2:39:02.200 --> 2:39:04.440
 debate to try to really get to the bottom of things.

2:39:04.440 --> 2:39:06.320
 And it was all private.

2:39:06.320 --> 2:39:09.160
 So I went to this group and I said, look,

2:39:09.160 --> 2:39:12.880
 this playing field is now skewed.

2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:14.920
 These guys, they've put out this thing,

2:39:14.920 --> 2:39:16.840
 lab incident origin, extremely unlikely.

2:39:16.840 --> 2:39:19.560
 It's in every newspaper in the world.

2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:21.880
 We can't just be our own little private group

2:39:21.880 --> 2:39:23.400
 talking to each other.

2:39:23.400 --> 2:39:26.800
 So I led the political process of drafting

2:39:26.800 --> 2:39:31.360
 what became four open letters that many of us signed,

2:39:31.360 --> 2:39:35.000
 most of us signed, that saying, all right,

2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:41.040
 here's why this study group and the report are not credible.

2:39:41.040 --> 2:39:42.400
 Here's what's wrong.

2:39:42.400 --> 2:39:45.840
 Here's what a full investigation would look like.

2:39:45.840 --> 2:39:48.360
 Here's a treasure map of all the resources

2:39:48.360 --> 2:39:50.480
 where people can look.

2:39:50.480 --> 2:39:52.800
 And we demand a comprehensive investigation.

2:39:52.800 --> 2:39:56.240
 So those four open letters were in pretty much

2:39:56.240 --> 2:39:58.520
 every newspaper in the world.

2:39:58.520 --> 2:40:00.920
 And it played a really significant role

2:40:00.920 --> 2:40:02.640
 along with some other things.

2:40:02.640 --> 2:40:05.920
 There was later, there was a letter, a short letter

2:40:05.920 --> 2:40:10.360
 in Science making basically similar points

2:40:10.360 --> 2:40:11.760
 in a much more condensed way.

2:40:11.760 --> 2:40:14.600
 There were some higher profile articles

2:40:14.600 --> 2:40:19.720
 by Nicholas Wade and Nick Baker and others.

2:40:19.720 --> 2:40:24.440
 And those collectively shifted the conversation.

2:40:24.440 --> 2:40:29.320
 And then really impressively, the WHO,

2:40:29.320 --> 2:40:30.880
 and with Tedros's leadership, did

2:40:30.880 --> 2:40:33.520
 something that was really incredible.

2:40:33.520 --> 2:40:36.680
 And that is earlier this year, they,

2:40:36.680 --> 2:40:39.520
 meaning the leadership of the WHO, not the World Health

2:40:39.520 --> 2:40:43.400
 Assembly, but the leadership of the WHO,

2:40:43.400 --> 2:40:45.600
 announced the establishment of what's

2:40:45.600 --> 2:40:49.480
 called SAGO, the Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins

2:40:49.480 --> 2:40:51.360
 of Novel Pathogens.

2:40:51.360 --> 2:40:55.560
 And basically what they did was overrule their own governing

2:40:55.560 --> 2:40:59.240
 board and say, we're going to create our own entity.

2:40:59.240 --> 2:41:03.120
 So it basically dissolved that international, deeply flawed

2:41:03.120 --> 2:41:04.440
 international joint study group.

2:41:04.440 --> 2:41:07.920
 And a lot of those people, they have become very critical,

2:41:07.920 --> 2:41:11.040
 like the Chinese of Tedros.

2:41:11.040 --> 2:41:15.200
 So then they had an open call for nominations

2:41:15.200 --> 2:41:17.520
 to be part of SAGO.

2:41:17.520 --> 2:41:23.080
 And so a lot of people put in their nominations.

2:41:23.080 --> 2:41:25.440
 They selected 26 people.

2:41:25.440 --> 2:41:27.360
 But our group, we had a meeting, and we

2:41:27.360 --> 2:41:30.800
 were unhappy with that list of 26.

2:41:30.800 --> 2:41:35.200
 It still felt skewed toward the natural origin hypothesis.

2:41:35.200 --> 2:41:38.440
 So again, I drafted, and we worked on together,

2:41:38.440 --> 2:41:42.640
 an open letter which we submitted to the WHO saying,

2:41:42.640 --> 2:41:45.200
 we think this list, it's a step in the right direction,

2:41:45.200 --> 2:41:46.680
 but it's not good enough.

2:41:46.680 --> 2:41:50.600
 And we call on these three people to be removed,

2:41:50.600 --> 2:41:53.920
 and we have these three people who we think should be added.

2:41:53.920 --> 2:41:56.560
 Incredibly, and I was in private touch

2:41:56.560 --> 2:42:00.280
 with the WHO, after announcing the 26 people,

2:42:00.280 --> 2:42:04.840
 the WHO said, we're reopening the process, so send in more.

2:42:04.840 --> 2:42:08.600
 And so then they added two more people, one of whom

2:42:08.600 --> 2:42:13.840
 is an expert in the auditing of lab incidents.

2:42:13.840 --> 2:42:17.040
 And then one of the, so they added those two.

2:42:17.040 --> 2:42:20.280
 And then when they just released the list of people

2:42:20.280 --> 2:42:23.120
 who are part of SAGO, this one woman,

2:42:23.120 --> 2:42:26.760
 a highly respected Dutch virologist named Marion Koopmans,

2:42:26.760 --> 2:42:30.840
 who had been part of that deeply flawed and compromised

2:42:30.840 --> 2:42:33.960
 international study group, who had called,

2:42:33.960 --> 2:42:36.680
 who has consistently called a lab incident origin, quote,

2:42:36.680 --> 2:42:39.320
 unquote, a debunked conspiracy theory.

2:42:39.320 --> 2:42:42.720
 As of now, her name is not on the list.

2:42:42.720 --> 2:42:44.760
 We haven't seen any announcements.

2:42:44.760 --> 2:42:48.040
 So I summary, and I'm sorry to go on for so long

2:42:48.040 --> 2:42:49.520
 and to be so animated about this,

2:42:49.520 --> 2:42:55.640
 I genuinely feel that the WHO is trying to do the right thing.

2:42:55.640 --> 2:42:59.440
 But they exist within a political context.

2:42:59.440 --> 2:43:03.680
 And they're pushing at the edges,

2:43:03.680 --> 2:43:07.520
 but there's only so far that they can go.

2:43:07.520 --> 2:43:10.080
 And that's why we definitely need

2:43:10.080 --> 2:43:12.440
 to have full accountability for the WHO.

2:43:12.440 --> 2:43:14.800
 We need to expand the mandate to WHO.

2:43:14.800 --> 2:43:18.080
 But we need to recognize that states have a big role.

2:43:18.080 --> 2:43:21.440
 And China is an incredibly influential state

2:43:21.440 --> 2:43:24.560
 that's doing everything possible to prevent

2:43:24.560 --> 2:43:27.320
 the kind of full investigation into pandemic origins

2:43:27.320 --> 2:43:28.800
 that's so desperately required.

2:43:28.800 --> 2:43:31.080
 Well, it sounds like the leadership

2:43:31.080 --> 2:43:34.160
 made all the difference in the WHO.

2:43:34.160 --> 2:43:37.120
 So like the way to change the momentum of large institutions

2:43:37.120 --> 2:43:38.840
 is through the leadership.

2:43:38.840 --> 2:43:42.560
 Leadership and empowerment, as I mentioned,

2:43:42.560 --> 2:43:45.040
 the World Health Assembly is meeting now.

2:43:45.040 --> 2:43:50.720
 And I think that it shouldn't be that we require superhumans.

2:43:50.720 --> 2:43:53.720
 And there are some people who are big critics of WHO.

2:43:53.720 --> 2:44:00.440
 The leader of the WHO in SARS 1 was definitely more aggressive.

2:44:00.440 --> 2:44:05.520
 She had a different set of powers at that time.

2:44:05.520 --> 2:44:08.920
 But it can't be entirely, we definitely

2:44:08.920 --> 2:44:12.560
 need strong willed, aggressive, independent people

2:44:12.560 --> 2:44:14.480
 in these kinds of roles.

2:44:14.480 --> 2:44:17.840
 We also need a more empowered WHO.

2:44:17.840 --> 2:44:20.520
 Like when the Chinese government in the earliest days

2:44:20.520 --> 2:44:23.360
 of the pandemic said, we're just not

2:44:23.360 --> 2:44:26.120
 going to allow you to send a team to collect

2:44:26.120 --> 2:44:27.000
 your own information.

2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:30.760
 And we're not going to allow you to have

2:44:30.760 --> 2:44:34.120
 any kind of independent surveillance,

2:44:34.120 --> 2:44:38.280
 there was very little that the WHO could do because

2:44:38.280 --> 2:44:40.600
 of the limitations of its mandate.

2:44:40.600 --> 2:44:44.040
 And we can't just say we're going to have a WHO that only

2:44:44.040 --> 2:44:46.240
 compromises Chinese sovereignty.

2:44:46.240 --> 2:44:48.520
 If we want to have a powerful WHO,

2:44:48.520 --> 2:44:54.440
 we should say we have emergency teams when the director

2:44:54.440 --> 2:44:57.720
 general says an emergency team needs to go somewhere.

2:44:57.720 --> 2:45:00.440
 If they aren't allowed to go there that day,

2:45:00.440 --> 2:45:02.480
 you could say there's an immediate referral

2:45:02.480 --> 2:45:03.640
 to the Security Council.

2:45:03.640 --> 2:45:05.760
 There needs to be something.

2:45:05.760 --> 2:45:09.160
 But we have all these demands, rightfully,

2:45:09.160 --> 2:45:13.240
 so of the WHO, which doesn't have the authorities.

2:45:13.240 --> 2:45:16.240
 The WHO itself only controls 20% of its own budget.

2:45:16.240 --> 2:45:17.680
 So the governments are saying, we're

2:45:17.680 --> 2:45:21.640
 going to give you money to do this or that.

2:45:21.640 --> 2:45:27.160
 So we need a stronger WHO to protect us,

2:45:27.160 --> 2:45:28.920
 but we also have to build that.

2:45:28.920 --> 2:45:33.000
 So looking a little bit into the future,

2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:35.080
 let's first step into the past, sort

2:45:35.080 --> 2:45:39.640
 of the philosophical question about China.

2:45:39.640 --> 2:45:43.520
 If you were to put yourself in the shoes of the Chinese

2:45:43.520 --> 2:45:49.400
 government, if they were to be more transparent,

2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:51.520
 how should they be more transparent?

2:45:51.520 --> 2:45:57.720
 Because it's easier to say, we want to see this.

2:45:57.720 --> 2:45:59.280
 But from a perspective of government,

2:45:59.280 --> 2:46:00.720
 and not just the Chinese government,

2:46:00.720 --> 2:46:07.880
 but a government on WHO's geographic territory,

2:46:07.880 --> 2:46:11.280
 say it's a lab leak, a lab leak occurred

2:46:11.280 --> 2:46:16.200
 that has resulted in trillions of dollars of loss,

2:46:16.200 --> 2:46:20.760
 countless of lives, just all kinds of damage to the world.

2:46:24.120 --> 2:46:27.760
 If they were to admit or show data

2:46:27.760 --> 2:46:31.200
 that could serve as evidence for a lab leak,

2:46:31.200 --> 2:46:35.720
 that's something that people could, in the worst case,

2:46:35.720 --> 2:46:41.200
 start wars over, or in the most likely case,

2:46:41.200 --> 2:46:45.960
 just constantly bring that up at every turn,

2:46:45.960 --> 2:46:50.280
 making you powerless in negotiations.

2:46:50.280 --> 2:46:51.880
 Whenever you want to do something

2:46:51.880 --> 2:46:54.880
 in geopolitical sense, the United States

2:46:54.880 --> 2:46:57.120
 will bring up, oh, remember that time

2:46:57.120 --> 2:47:01.480
 you cost us trillions of dollars because of your fuck up?

2:47:01.480 --> 2:47:05.440
 So what is the incentive for the Chinese government

2:47:05.440 --> 2:47:07.400
 to be transparent?

2:47:07.400 --> 2:47:11.520
 And if it is to be transparent, how should it do it?

2:47:11.520 --> 2:47:14.160
 So there's a bunch of people.

2:47:14.160 --> 2:47:17.040
 The reason I'm talking to you, as opposed

2:47:17.040 --> 2:47:19.960
 to a bunch of other folks, because you

2:47:19.960 --> 2:47:22.800
 are kindhearted and thoughtful and open minded

2:47:22.800 --> 2:47:24.520
 and really respected.

2:47:24.520 --> 2:47:27.520
 There's a bunch of people that are talking about lab leak

2:47:27.520 --> 2:47:31.480
 that are a little bit less interested in building

2:47:31.480 --> 2:47:34.840
 a better world and more interested in pointing out

2:47:34.840 --> 2:47:36.160
 the emperor has no clothes.

2:47:36.160 --> 2:47:40.480
 They want step one, which is saying, basically,

2:47:40.480 --> 2:47:43.560
 tearing down the bullshitters.

2:47:43.560 --> 2:47:48.360
 They don't want to do the further steps of building.

2:47:48.360 --> 2:47:50.520
 And so as the Chinese government,

2:47:50.520 --> 2:47:53.960
 I would be nervous about being transparent with anybody that

2:47:53.960 --> 2:47:58.280
 just wants to tear our power centers, our power

2:47:58.280 --> 2:47:59.120
 structures down.

2:47:59.120 --> 2:48:01.600
 Anyway, that's a long way to ask,

2:48:01.600 --> 2:48:06.320
 how should the Chinese government be transparent now

2:48:06.320 --> 2:48:08.480
 and in the future?

2:48:08.480 --> 2:48:12.200
 So maybe I'll break that down into a few sub questions.

2:48:12.200 --> 2:48:15.760
 The first is, what should, in an ideal world,

2:48:15.760 --> 2:48:17.560
 what should the Chinese government do?

2:48:17.560 --> 2:48:20.120
 And that's pretty straightforward.

2:48:20.120 --> 2:48:22.600
 They should be totally transparent.

2:48:22.600 --> 2:48:24.600
 The South African government now,

2:48:24.600 --> 2:48:27.880
 there is an outbreak of this Omicron variant.

2:48:27.880 --> 2:48:31.120
 And the South African government has done what we would want.

2:48:31.120 --> 2:48:33.240
 A government to do is say, hey, there's an outbreak.

2:48:33.240 --> 2:48:35.600
 We don't have all of the information.

2:48:35.600 --> 2:48:36.520
 We need help.

2:48:36.520 --> 2:48:38.520
 We want to alert the world.

2:48:38.520 --> 2:48:41.000
 And in some ways, they're being punished for it

2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:42.040
 through these travel bans.

2:48:42.040 --> 2:48:43.680
 But it's a separate topic.

2:48:43.680 --> 2:48:46.480
 But I actually think short term travel bans actually

2:48:46.480 --> 2:48:49.040
 are not a terrible idea.

2:48:49.040 --> 2:48:51.960
 They should have, on day one, they

2:48:51.960 --> 2:48:55.000
 should have allowed WHO experts in.

2:48:55.000 --> 2:48:57.200
 They should have shared information.

2:48:57.200 --> 2:49:00.200
 They should have allowed a full and comprehensive

2:49:00.200 --> 2:49:04.240
 investigation with international partnerships

2:49:04.240 --> 2:49:07.920
 to understand what went wrong.

2:49:07.920 --> 2:49:10.560
 They should have shared their raw data.

2:49:10.560 --> 2:49:12.880
 They should have allowed their scientists

2:49:12.880 --> 2:49:14.720
 to speak and write publicly.

2:49:14.720 --> 2:49:17.040
 Because nobody knows more about this stuff,

2:49:17.040 --> 2:49:20.560
 certainly in the early days, than their scientists do.

2:49:20.560 --> 2:49:26.480
 So it's relatively easy to say what they should do.

2:49:26.480 --> 2:49:29.520
 It's a hard question to say, well, what would happen?

2:49:29.520 --> 2:49:35.240
 Let's just say tomorrow, we prove for certain

2:49:35.240 --> 2:49:38.640
 that this pandemic stems both from an accidental lab

2:49:38.640 --> 2:49:40.960
 incident and then from what I've consistently

2:49:40.960 --> 2:49:42.880
 called a criminal cover up.

2:49:42.880 --> 2:49:46.280
 Because the cover up has done, in many ways,

2:49:46.280 --> 2:49:49.880
 as much or more damage than the incident.

2:49:49.880 --> 2:49:50.840
 Well, what happens?

2:49:50.840 --> 2:49:54.120
 You could easily imagine Xi Jinping has had two terms

2:49:54.120 --> 2:49:57.760
 as the leader of China.

2:49:57.760 --> 2:49:59.920
 And he can now have unlimited terms.

2:49:59.920 --> 2:50:01.920
 Well, they've changed the rules for that.

2:50:01.920 --> 2:50:03.600
 But he's got a lot of enemies.

2:50:03.600 --> 2:50:06.040
 I mean, there are a lot of people who are waiting in line

2:50:06.040 --> 2:50:07.680
 to step up.

2:50:07.680 --> 2:50:11.200
 So is there a chance that Xi Jinping could be deposed

2:50:11.200 --> 2:50:13.240
 if it was proven that this comes from a lab?

2:50:13.240 --> 2:50:15.520
 And I think there's a real possibility.

2:50:15.520 --> 2:50:19.400
 Would people in the United States Congress, for example,

2:50:19.400 --> 2:50:21.920
 demand reparations from China?

2:50:21.920 --> 2:50:26.280
 So we've had $4.5 trillion of stimulus,

2:50:26.280 --> 2:50:29.840
 all of the economic losses, and we owe a lot of money

2:50:29.840 --> 2:50:32.960
 to China from our debt.

2:50:32.960 --> 2:50:35.520
 I'm quite certain that members of Congress

2:50:35.520 --> 2:50:37.640
 would say, we're just going to wipe that out.

2:50:37.640 --> 2:50:39.880
 It would destroy the global financial system,

2:50:39.880 --> 2:50:42.320
 but I think they would be extremely likely.

2:50:42.320 --> 2:50:44.400
 Would other countries, like India,

2:50:44.400 --> 2:50:47.760
 that have lost millions of people

2:50:47.760 --> 2:50:50.680
 and had terrible economic damages,

2:50:50.680 --> 2:50:53.360
 would they demand reparations?

2:50:53.360 --> 2:50:55.760
 So I think from a Chinese perspective,

2:50:55.760 --> 2:50:58.120
 starting from now, it would have

2:50:58.120 --> 2:51:00.560
 major geopolitical implications.

2:51:00.560 --> 2:51:03.600
 And go back to Chernobyl, there was

2:51:03.600 --> 2:51:06.800
 a reason why the Soviet Union went to such length

2:51:06.800 --> 2:51:08.280
 to cover things up.

2:51:08.280 --> 2:51:11.520
 And when it came out, I mean, there are different theories,

2:51:11.520 --> 2:51:15.840
 but certainly Chernobyl played some role

2:51:15.840 --> 2:51:21.280
 in the end of communist power in the Soviet Union.

2:51:21.280 --> 2:51:25.320
 So the Chinese are very, very aware of that.

2:51:25.320 --> 2:51:27.360
 But the difference, of course, with Chernobyl,

2:51:27.360 --> 2:51:28.680
 the damage to the rest of the world

2:51:28.680 --> 2:51:32.040
 was not nearly as significant as it was with COVID.

2:51:32.040 --> 2:51:34.520
 So you say that the coverup is a crime,

2:51:34.520 --> 2:51:37.720
 but everything you just described,

2:51:37.720 --> 2:51:40.800
 the response of the rest of the world,

2:51:40.800 --> 2:51:44.040
 is, I could say, unfair.

2:51:45.040 --> 2:51:46.320
 Well, it's not...

2:51:46.320 --> 2:51:50.640
 So, okay, if we say the best possible version of the story,

2:51:50.640 --> 2:51:55.400
 you know, lab leaks happen, they shouldn't happen,

2:51:55.400 --> 2:51:57.760
 but they happen.

2:51:57.760 --> 2:52:01.080
 And how is that on the Chinese government?

2:52:02.280 --> 2:52:04.000
 I mean, what's a good example?

2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:05.040
 Well, the Union Carbide.

2:52:05.040 --> 2:52:07.440
 Union Carbide, there was this American company

2:52:07.440 --> 2:52:10.280
 operating in India, they had this leak,

2:52:10.280 --> 2:52:12.600
 all these people were killed.

2:52:12.600 --> 2:52:15.080
 The company admitted responsibility.

2:52:15.080 --> 2:52:17.480
 I was working in the White House

2:52:17.480 --> 2:52:19.480
 when the United States government, in my view,

2:52:19.480 --> 2:52:20.960
 which I know to be the case,

2:52:20.960 --> 2:52:23.440
 but other people in China think differently,

2:52:23.440 --> 2:52:25.480
 bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.

2:52:25.480 --> 2:52:27.720
 And so the United States government

2:52:27.720 --> 2:52:29.560
 allowed a full investigation,

2:52:29.560 --> 2:52:34.280
 then we paid reparations to the families.

2:52:34.280 --> 2:52:36.880
 And so to your question, if I were,

2:52:36.880 --> 2:52:39.600
 let's just say I were the Chinese government,

2:52:39.600 --> 2:52:42.080
 not, I mean, kind of an idealized version

2:52:42.080 --> 2:52:43.760
 of the Chinese government.

2:52:43.760 --> 2:52:46.960
 And let's just say that they had come to the conclusion

2:52:46.960 --> 2:52:49.000
 that it was a lab incident.

2:52:49.000 --> 2:52:52.800
 And let's just say they knew that even if

2:52:52.800 --> 2:52:55.080
 they continued to cover it up,

2:52:55.080 --> 2:52:58.640
 eventually this information would come out.

2:52:58.640 --> 2:53:00.160
 I mean, maybe there was a whistleblower,

2:53:00.160 --> 2:53:01.960
 maybe they knew of some evidence

2:53:01.960 --> 2:53:05.240
 that we didn't know about or something.

2:53:05.240 --> 2:53:07.660
 What would I do starting right now?

2:53:09.160 --> 2:53:12.560
 What I would do is I would hold a press conference

2:53:12.560 --> 2:53:16.840
 and I would say, we had this terrible accident.

2:53:16.840 --> 2:53:19.520
 The reason why we were doing this research

2:53:19.520 --> 2:53:23.320
 in Wuhan and elsewhere is that we had SARS one

2:53:23.320 --> 2:53:26.400
 and we felt a responsibility to do everything possible

2:53:26.400 --> 2:53:29.400
 to prevent that kind of terrible thing happening again

2:53:29.400 --> 2:53:31.480
 for our country and for the world.

2:53:31.480 --> 2:53:34.480
 That was why we collaborated with France,

2:53:34.480 --> 2:53:38.400
 with the United States in building up those capacities.

2:53:38.400 --> 2:53:40.480
 We know that nothing is perfect,

2:53:40.480 --> 2:53:42.800
 but we're a sovereign country and we have our own system.

2:53:42.800 --> 2:53:45.720
 And so we had to adapt our systems

2:53:45.720 --> 2:53:49.400
 so that they made sense internally.

2:53:49.400 --> 2:53:53.960
 When this outbreak began, we didn't know how it started.

2:53:53.960 --> 2:53:57.680
 And that was why we wanted to look into things.

2:53:57.680 --> 2:54:01.400
 When the process of investigating became so political,

2:54:01.400 --> 2:54:04.680
 it gave us pause and we were worried that our enemies

2:54:04.680 --> 2:54:07.440
 were trying to use this investigation

2:54:07.440 --> 2:54:09.520
 in order to undermine us.

2:54:09.520 --> 2:54:13.680
 Having said that, now that we've dug deeper,

2:54:13.680 --> 2:54:16.640
 we have recognized because we have access

2:54:16.640 --> 2:54:19.480
 to additional information that we didn't have then,

2:54:19.480 --> 2:54:23.520
 that this pandemic started from an accidental lab incident.

2:54:23.520 --> 2:54:25.800
 And we feel really terribly about that.

2:54:25.800 --> 2:54:28.440
 And we know that we were very aggressive

2:54:28.440 --> 2:54:31.040
 in covering up information in the beginning,

2:54:31.040 --> 2:54:34.320
 but the reason we were doing that is because we thoroughly,

2:54:34.320 --> 2:54:37.600
 we fully believe that it came from a natural origin.

2:54:37.600 --> 2:54:41.280
 Now that we see otherwise, we feel terribly.

2:54:41.280 --> 2:54:44.880
 Therefore, we're doing a few different things.

2:54:44.880 --> 2:54:48.160
 One is we are committing ourselves

2:54:48.160 --> 2:54:53.160
 to establishing a stronger WHO, a new pandemic treaty

2:54:54.000 --> 2:54:57.800
 that addresses the major challenges that we face

2:54:57.800 --> 2:55:00.960
 and allows the World Health Organization

2:55:00.960 --> 2:55:03.680
 to pierce the veil of absolute sovereignty

2:55:03.680 --> 2:55:06.840
 because we know that when these pandemics happen,

2:55:06.840 --> 2:55:08.680
 they affect everybody.

2:55:08.680 --> 2:55:11.920
 We are also putting, and you can pick your number,

2:55:11.920 --> 2:55:15.280
 but let's start with five trillion US dollars,

2:55:15.280 --> 2:55:19.560
 some massive amount, into a fund

2:55:19.560 --> 2:55:24.480
 that we will be distributing to the victims of COVID 19

2:55:24.480 --> 2:55:26.040
 and their, and their.

2:55:26.040 --> 2:55:27.560
 China would do that?

2:55:27.560 --> 2:55:29.440
 This is a fantasy speech.

2:55:29.440 --> 2:55:31.840
 But I disagree with your, I mean, okay.

2:55:34.160 --> 2:55:36.880
 So you think China has a responsibility?

2:55:36.880 --> 2:55:40.480
 Well, so it's not the, like just a lab leak.

2:55:40.480 --> 2:55:45.120
 Like if China on day one had said we have this outbreak,

2:55:45.120 --> 2:55:47.080
 we don't know where it came from,

2:55:47.080 --> 2:55:50.120
 we want to have a full investigation,

2:55:50.120 --> 2:55:52.120
 we call on international,

2:55:52.120 --> 2:55:53.840
 responsible international partners

2:55:53.840 --> 2:55:55.640
 to join us in that process,

2:55:55.640 --> 2:55:58.000
 and we're going to do everything in our power

2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:00.360
 to share the relevant information

2:56:00.360 --> 2:56:03.200
 because however this started, we're all victims.

2:56:03.200 --> 2:56:05.120
 That's a totally different story

2:56:05.120 --> 2:56:08.840
 than punishing Australia, preventing the WHO,

2:56:08.840 --> 2:56:10.640
 blocking any investigation,

2:56:10.640 --> 2:56:13.920
 condemning people who are trying to look, and so that's.

2:56:13.920 --> 2:56:16.880
 So cover up for a couple weeks,

2:56:16.880 --> 2:56:18.600
 you can understand maybe,

2:56:18.600 --> 2:56:20.480
 because there's so much uncertainty.

2:56:20.480 --> 2:56:24.600
 You're like, oh, let's hide all the Winnie the Pooh pictures

2:56:24.600 --> 2:56:26.040
 while we figure this out.

2:56:26.040 --> 2:56:28.800
 But the moment you really figure out what happened,

2:56:30.320 --> 2:56:32.320
 you always, as a Jew I can say this,

2:56:32.320 --> 2:56:35.280
 always find like a blame the Jews kind of situation

2:56:35.280 --> 2:56:36.600
 a little bit, just a little bit.

2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:38.440
 Be like, all right, it's not us.

2:56:38.440 --> 2:56:41.000
 I'm just kidding.

2:56:41.000 --> 2:56:44.680
 But be proactive in saying.

2:56:44.680 --> 2:56:47.640
 Just to start here, but the joke about that is

2:56:47.640 --> 2:56:50.120
 there's a big problem because a lot of people

2:56:50.120 --> 2:56:53.080
 have to leave the Jewish socialist conspiracy

2:56:53.080 --> 2:56:56.080
 to make it for the Jewish capitalist conspiracy meeting.

2:56:56.080 --> 2:56:56.920
 I love it.

2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:01.680
 So I would say not five trillion,

2:57:01.680 --> 2:57:03.440
 but some large amount,

2:57:03.440 --> 2:57:05.200
 and I would really focus on the future,

2:57:05.200 --> 2:57:08.000
 which is every time we talk about the lab leak,

2:57:09.280 --> 2:57:11.760
 the unfortunate thing is I feel like people

2:57:11.760 --> 2:57:13.360
 don't focus enough about the future.

2:57:13.360 --> 2:57:15.080
 To me, the lab leak is important

2:57:16.200 --> 2:57:20.200
 because we want to construct a kind of framework

2:57:20.200 --> 2:57:23.720
 of thinking and a global conversation

2:57:23.720 --> 2:57:28.400
 that minimizes the damage done by future lab leaks,

2:57:28.400 --> 2:57:30.800
 which will almost certainly happen.

2:57:30.800 --> 2:57:35.800
 And so to me, any lab leak is about the future.

2:57:35.920 --> 2:57:40.080
 I would launch a giant investment in saying

2:57:40.080 --> 2:57:43.480
 we're going to create a testing infrastructure,

2:57:43.480 --> 2:57:46.800
 like all of this kind of infrastructure investments

2:57:46.800 --> 2:57:49.560
 that help minimize the damage of a lab leak

2:57:49.560 --> 2:57:51.320
 here and the rest of the world.

2:57:51.320 --> 2:57:54.480
 So the challenge with that is one,

2:57:54.480 --> 2:57:58.440
 it's hard to imagine a fully accountable future system

2:57:58.440 --> 2:58:01.960
 to prevent these kinds of terrible pandemics

2:58:01.960 --> 2:58:06.000
 that's built upon obfuscation and coverup

2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:09.600
 regarding the origins of this worst pandemic in a century.

2:58:09.600 --> 2:58:14.360
 So it's just like that foundation isn't strong enough.

2:58:14.360 --> 2:58:17.840
 Second, China across the fields of science

2:58:17.840 --> 2:58:20.760
 is looking to leapfrog the rest of the world.

2:58:20.760 --> 2:58:25.160
 So China now has current plans to build BSL4 labs

2:58:25.160 --> 2:58:27.120
 in every of its province.

2:58:27.120 --> 2:58:28.640
 Yeah, they're scaling up the.

2:58:28.640 --> 2:58:32.400
 Scaling up everything ends up with the plan on leading.

2:58:32.400 --> 2:58:33.720
 And that's why, again, I was saying before,

2:58:33.720 --> 2:58:36.720
 I think there's a lot of similarity between this story,

2:58:36.720 --> 2:58:40.240
 at least as I see it, at least the most probable case,

2:58:40.240 --> 2:58:42.680
 and these other areas where China gets knowledge

2:58:42.680 --> 2:58:44.160
 and then tries to leapfrog.

2:58:44.160 --> 2:58:48.400
 It's the same with AI and autonomous killer robots.

2:58:48.400 --> 2:58:50.320
 It's the same with human genome editing,

2:58:50.320 --> 2:58:52.800
 with animal experimentations, with so many,

2:58:52.800 --> 2:58:57.000
 basically all areas of advanced science.

2:58:58.040 --> 2:59:01.800
 So the question is, would China stop in that process?

2:59:01.800 --> 2:59:05.600
 And then third, it's a little bit

2:59:05.600 --> 2:59:07.040
 of a historical background,

2:59:07.040 --> 2:59:10.640
 but defending national sovereignty

2:59:10.640 --> 2:59:13.480
 is one of the core principles of,

2:59:13.480 --> 2:59:16.080
 certainly of the Chinese state.

2:59:16.080 --> 2:59:18.480
 And the historical issue is,

2:59:18.480 --> 2:59:21.200
 for those of us who come from the West,

2:59:21.200 --> 2:59:24.040
 I mean, one of the lessons of the postwar planners

2:59:24.040 --> 2:59:26.960
 was that absolute national sovereignty

2:59:26.960 --> 2:59:29.720
 was actually a major feeder

2:59:29.720 --> 2:59:31.440
 into the first and second world wars,

2:59:31.440 --> 2:59:34.320
 that we had all these conflicting states.

2:59:34.320 --> 2:59:37.440
 And therefore the logic of the postwar system

2:59:37.440 --> 2:59:39.640
 is we need to in some ways pool sovereignty

2:59:39.640 --> 2:59:44.440
 that's like the EU and have transnational organizations

2:59:44.440 --> 2:59:46.000
 like the UN organizations

2:59:46.000 --> 2:59:47.840
 and the Bretton Woods organizations.

2:59:47.840 --> 2:59:49.560
 For most Asian states,

2:59:49.560 --> 2:59:51.800
 and also even for some African,

2:59:51.800 --> 2:59:52.880
 and the people who were kind of

2:59:52.880 --> 2:59:55.520
 on the colonized side of history,

2:59:55.520 --> 2:59:58.720
 sovereignty was the thing that was denied them.

2:59:58.720 --> 3:00:00.040
 That was the thing that they want,

3:00:00.040 --> 3:00:01.880
 that the European power is denied.

3:00:01.880 --> 3:00:04.720
 And so the idea of giving up sovereignty

3:00:04.720 --> 3:00:07.040
 was the absolute opposite.

3:00:07.040 --> 3:00:10.120
 And so that's why China is,

3:00:10.120 --> 3:00:12.400
 and again, I mentioned this Rush Doshi book.

3:00:12.400 --> 3:00:15.120
 It's not that China is trying to strengthen

3:00:15.120 --> 3:00:17.200
 this rules based international order,

3:00:17.200 --> 3:00:19.040
 which is based on the principle

3:00:19.040 --> 3:00:21.240
 that while there are certain things that we share

3:00:21.240 --> 3:00:23.800
 and how do we build a governance system

3:00:23.800 --> 3:00:25.680
 to protect those things,

3:00:25.680 --> 3:00:27.800
 what it seems to be doing is trying

3:00:27.800 --> 3:00:31.320
 to advance its own sovereignty.

3:00:31.320 --> 3:00:33.040
 And so I think I agree with you,

3:00:33.040 --> 3:00:37.080
 but I don't think that we can just go forward

3:00:37.080 --> 3:00:39.640
 without some accountability for the.

3:00:39.640 --> 3:00:41.480
 So the coverup was a big problem.

3:00:41.480 --> 3:00:44.080
 It's like, I often,

3:00:44.080 --> 3:00:46.560
 I find myself playing devil's advocate

3:00:46.560 --> 3:00:49.520
 because I'm trying to sort of empathize

3:00:49.520 --> 3:00:54.280
 and then I forget that like two or three people

3:00:54.280 --> 3:00:55.900
 listen to this thing and then they're like,

3:00:55.900 --> 3:00:58.880
 look, Lex is defending the Chinese government

3:00:58.880 --> 3:00:59.720
 with their coverup.

3:00:59.720 --> 3:01:04.720
 No, I'm not, I'm just trying to understand.

3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:08.040
 I mean, it's the same reason I'm reading Mein Kampf now

3:01:08.040 --> 3:01:13.040
 is like you have to really understand the minds of people

3:01:13.040 --> 3:01:18.040
 as if I too could have done that.

3:01:18.360 --> 3:01:19.660
 You know, you have to understand

3:01:19.660 --> 3:01:22.800
 that we're all the same to some degree

3:01:22.800 --> 3:01:25.300
 and that kind of empathy is required

3:01:25.300 --> 3:01:29.640
 to figure out solutions for the future.

3:01:29.640 --> 3:01:32.620
 It's just in empathizing with the Chinese government

3:01:32.620 --> 3:01:34.120
 in this whole situation,

3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:38.220
 I'm still not sure I understand

3:01:38.220 --> 3:01:41.840
 how to minimize the chance of a coverup in the future,

3:01:41.840 --> 3:01:44.040
 whether for China or for the United States.

3:01:44.040 --> 3:01:45.700
 If the virus started in the United States,

3:01:45.700 --> 3:01:48.040
 I'm not exactly sure we would be

3:01:49.380 --> 3:01:52.480
 with all the emphasis we put on freedom of speech,

3:01:52.480 --> 3:01:57.480
 with all the emphasis we put on freedom of the press

3:01:57.920 --> 3:02:00.480
 and access to the press,

3:02:00.480 --> 3:02:02.680
 the sort of all aspects of government.

3:02:02.680 --> 3:02:04.080
 I'm not sure the US government

3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:06.040
 wouldn't do the similar kind of coverup.

3:02:06.040 --> 3:02:07.280
 Let me put it this way.

3:02:07.280 --> 3:02:09.900
 So we're in Texas now doing this interview.

3:02:09.900 --> 3:02:13.560
 Imagine there's a kind of horseshoe bat

3:02:13.560 --> 3:02:18.560
 that we'll call the Texas Horseshoe Bat and the Texas.

3:02:18.580 --> 3:02:19.820
 There's a lot of bats in Austin,

3:02:19.820 --> 3:02:21.960
 but it's a whole thing. It's true, it's true.

3:02:21.960 --> 3:02:25.560
 And so let's just say that the Texas Horseshoe Bats

3:02:25.560 --> 3:02:30.400
 only exist in Texas, but in Montana,

3:02:30.400 --> 3:02:32.680
 we have a thing, it's called

3:02:32.680 --> 3:02:36.240
 the Montana Institute of Virology.

3:02:36.240 --> 3:02:38.860
 And at the Montana Institute of Virology,

3:02:38.860 --> 3:02:41.440
 they have the world's largest collection

3:02:41.440 --> 3:02:45.600
 of Texas Horseshoe Bats, including horseshoe bats

3:02:45.600 --> 3:02:50.600
 that are associated with a previous global pandemic

3:02:51.400 --> 3:02:55.000
 called the Texas Horseshoe Bat pandemic.

3:02:55.000 --> 3:02:58.880
 And let's just say that people in Montana,

3:02:58.880 --> 3:03:00.520
 in the same town where this

3:03:00.520 --> 3:03:03.320
 Montana Institute of Virology is,

3:03:03.320 --> 3:03:06.860
 start getting a version of this

3:03:06.860 --> 3:03:09.960
 Texas Horseshoe Bat syndrome

3:03:09.960 --> 3:03:13.600
 that is genetically relatively similar

3:03:13.600 --> 3:03:15.240
 to the outbreak in Texas.

3:03:15.240 --> 3:03:18.040
 There are no horseshoe bats there.

3:03:18.040 --> 3:03:21.360
 And the government says, it's your same point,

3:03:21.360 --> 3:03:23.280
 Alina's point about the unicorns,

3:03:23.280 --> 3:03:26.040
 like nothing to see here, just move along.

3:03:28.280 --> 3:03:33.280
 Would Joe Rogan and Brett Weinstein and Josh Rogan,

3:03:34.320 --> 3:03:36.720
 would they say, oh, I guess, I just think that.

3:03:36.720 --> 3:03:40.560
 No, no, but the point is the government going to say it.

3:03:40.560 --> 3:03:45.040
 So, Joe Rogan is a comedian.

3:03:45.040 --> 3:03:48.880
 Brett Weinstein is a podcaster.

3:03:48.880 --> 3:03:53.480
 The point is, what we want is not just those folks

3:03:53.480 --> 3:03:56.220
 to have the freedom to speak, that's important.

3:03:56.220 --> 3:03:58.400
 But you want the government to have the transparent,

3:03:58.400 --> 3:04:02.360
 like, I don't think Joe Rogan is enough

3:04:02.360 --> 3:04:04.360
 to hold the government accountable.

3:04:04.360 --> 3:04:06.800
 I think they're going to do their thing anyway.

3:04:06.800 --> 3:04:09.080
 But I think that's our system,

3:04:09.080 --> 3:04:12.320
 and that was the genius of the founding fathers.

3:04:12.320 --> 3:04:13.240
 Is that enough?

3:04:13.240 --> 3:04:16.040
 That the government probably is going to have

3:04:16.040 --> 3:04:18.240
 a lot of instincts to do the wrong thing.

3:04:18.240 --> 3:04:22.360
 That was the experience in England before.

3:04:22.360 --> 3:04:25.800
 And so that's why we have free speech,

3:04:25.800 --> 3:04:27.160
 to hold the government accountable.

3:04:27.160 --> 3:04:30.160
 I mean, I'm kind of broadly a gun control person,

3:04:30.160 --> 3:04:31.540
 but the people who say, well,

3:04:31.540 --> 3:04:34.640
 we need to have broad gun rights.

3:04:34.640 --> 3:04:39.040
 As somebody who's now in Texas, I am offended.

3:04:39.040 --> 3:04:40.400
 But their argument is, look,

3:04:40.400 --> 3:04:42.920
 we don't fully trust the government.

3:04:42.920 --> 3:04:47.440
 If the government, just like we fought against the British,

3:04:47.440 --> 3:04:48.520
 if the government's wrong,

3:04:48.520 --> 3:04:51.040
 we want to at least have some authority.

3:04:51.040 --> 3:04:53.640
 So that's our system, is to have that kind of voice.

3:04:53.640 --> 3:04:57.600
 And that is the public voice actually balances.

3:04:57.600 --> 3:05:00.080
 Because every government, as you correctly said,

3:05:00.080 --> 3:05:02.880
 every government has the same instincts.

3:05:02.880 --> 3:05:06.480
 And that's why we have, and it's imperfect here,

3:05:06.480 --> 3:05:08.640
 but kind of these ideas of separation of powers,

3:05:08.640 --> 3:05:11.280
 of inalienable rights, so that we can have,

3:05:11.280 --> 3:05:14.620
 it's almost like a vast market where we can have balance.

3:05:14.620 --> 3:05:17.940
 So you think if a lab leak occurred in the United States,

3:05:18.900 --> 3:05:23.900
 what probability would you put some kind of public report

3:05:24.120 --> 3:05:29.120
 led by Rand Paul would come out saying this was a lab leak?

3:05:29.120 --> 3:05:31.600
 You have good confidence that that would happen?

3:05:31.600 --> 3:05:32.440
 I have pretty decent confidence.

3:05:32.440 --> 3:05:35.160
 And the reason I say, I mentioned that I'm a,

3:05:35.160 --> 3:05:37.240
 I think of myself, I'm sure I'm not anymore,

3:05:37.240 --> 3:05:39.840
 because as I get older, but as a progressive person,

3:05:39.840 --> 3:05:44.280
 I'm a Democrat and I worked in Democratic administrations,

3:05:44.280 --> 3:05:47.760
 worked for President Clinton on the National Security Council.

3:05:47.760 --> 3:05:52.520
 But my kind of best friend in the United States Senate,

3:05:52.520 --> 3:05:55.560
 who I talk to all the time,

3:05:55.560 --> 3:05:59.400
 is a Senator from Kansas named Roger Marshall.

3:05:59.400 --> 3:06:03.320
 And Roger, I mean, if you just lined up our positions

3:06:03.320 --> 3:06:07.340
 on all sorts of things, we're radically different.

3:06:08.480 --> 3:06:11.640
 But we have a great relationship.

3:06:11.640 --> 3:06:16.080
 We talk all the time and we share a commitment to saying,

3:06:16.080 --> 3:06:20.120
 well, let's ask the tough questions about how this started.

3:06:20.120 --> 3:06:22.600
 And again, if we had,

3:06:22.600 --> 3:06:24.280
 like what is the United States government?

3:06:24.280 --> 3:06:27.280
 Yeah, it's the executive branch, but there's also Congress.

3:06:27.280 --> 3:06:29.880
 And Congress, you talk about Rand Paul,

3:06:29.880 --> 3:06:33.480
 and as a former executive branch worker,

3:06:33.480 --> 3:06:35.560
 when I was on the National Security Council,

3:06:35.560 --> 3:06:38.880
 and I guess technically when I was at the State Department,

3:06:38.880 --> 3:06:40.800
 all of this stuff, all of this process,

3:06:40.800 --> 3:06:42.600
 it just seems like a pain in the ass.

3:06:42.600 --> 3:06:46.680
 It's like these Fers, they're just attacking us.

3:06:46.680 --> 3:06:48.360
 We tried to do this thing with,

3:06:48.360 --> 3:06:49.840
 we had all the best intentions

3:06:49.840 --> 3:06:50.960
 and now they're holding hearings

3:06:50.960 --> 3:06:53.680
 and they're trying to box us in and whatever.

3:06:53.680 --> 3:06:55.040
 But that's our process.

3:06:55.040 --> 3:06:58.260
 And there's like a form of accountability as chaotic,

3:06:58.260 --> 3:07:00.640
 as crazy as it is.

3:07:00.640 --> 3:07:03.400
 And so it makes it really difficult.

3:07:03.400 --> 3:07:05.640
 I mean, we have other problems of just chaos

3:07:05.640 --> 3:07:07.580
 and everybody doing their own thing,

3:07:07.580 --> 3:07:09.840
 but it makes it difficult to have

3:07:09.840 --> 3:07:11.620
 the kind of systematic coverup.

3:07:11.620 --> 3:07:15.900
 And again, all of that is predicated on my hypothesis,

3:07:15.900 --> 3:07:18.600
 not fully proven, although I think likely

3:07:18.600 --> 3:07:22.960
 that there is a lab incident origin of this pandemic.

3:07:22.960 --> 3:07:25.800
 Well, I mean, we're having like several layers

3:07:25.800 --> 3:07:30.800
 of conversation, but I think whether lab leak hypothesis

3:07:31.800 --> 3:07:36.640
 is true or not, it does seem that the likelihood

3:07:36.640 --> 3:07:41.640
 of a coverup, if it leaked from a lab is high.

3:07:41.880 --> 3:07:45.360
 That's the more important conversation to be having.

3:07:45.360 --> 3:07:48.000
 Well, you could argue a lot of things,

3:07:48.000 --> 3:07:51.480
 but to me arguably, that's the more important conversation

3:07:51.480 --> 3:07:53.720
 is about what is the likelihood of a coverup.

3:07:53.720 --> 3:07:58.720
 100%, like in my mind, there is a legitimate debate

3:07:59.400 --> 3:08:01.920
 about the origins of the pandemic.

3:08:01.920 --> 3:08:04.080
 There are people who I respect,

3:08:04.080 --> 3:08:06.360
 who I don't necessarily agree with,

3:08:06.360 --> 3:08:10.040
 people like Stuart Neal, who's a virologist in the UK,

3:08:10.040 --> 3:08:14.880
 who's been very open minded, engaged in productive debate

3:08:14.880 --> 3:08:18.200
 about the origin and you know where I stand.

3:08:18.200 --> 3:08:23.200
 There is and can be no debate about whether

3:08:23.200 --> 3:08:25.240
 or not there has been a coverup.

3:08:25.240 --> 3:08:26.400
 There has been a coverup.

3:08:26.400 --> 3:08:29.600
 There is in my mind, no credible argument

3:08:29.600 --> 3:08:31.340
 that there hasn't been a coverup.

3:08:31.340 --> 3:08:35.440
 And I mean, we can just see it in the regulations,

3:08:35.440 --> 3:08:37.120
 in the lack of access.

3:08:37.120 --> 3:08:40.480
 There's an incredible woman named Zhang Zhan,

3:08:40.480 --> 3:08:44.240
 who is a Chinese, we have to call her a citizen journalist

3:08:44.240 --> 3:08:46.060
 because everything is controlled by the state.

3:08:46.060 --> 3:08:47.720
 But in the early days of the pandemic,

3:08:47.720 --> 3:08:52.040
 she went to Wuhan, started taking videos and posting them.

3:08:52.040 --> 3:08:54.920
 She was imprisoned for picking quarrels,

3:08:54.920 --> 3:08:57.440
 which is kind of a catchall.

3:08:57.440 --> 3:09:00.260
 And now she's engaged in a hunger strike

3:09:00.260 --> 3:09:02.000
 and she's near death.

3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:06.680
 And so there's no question that there has been a coverup

3:09:06.680 --> 3:09:08.280
 and there's no question in my mind

3:09:08.280 --> 3:09:10.400
 that that coverup is responsible

3:09:10.400 --> 3:09:13.920
 for a significant percentage of the total deaths

3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:15.040
 due to COVID 19.

3:09:15.040 --> 3:09:20.040
 In a pivot, can I talk to you about sex?

3:09:22.040 --> 3:09:23.400
 Let's roll.

3:09:23.400 --> 3:09:26.520
 Okay, so you're the author of a book, Hacking Darwin.

3:09:29.120 --> 3:09:34.120
 So humans have used sex, allegedly, as I've read about,

3:09:36.200 --> 3:09:41.200
 to mix genetic information to produce offspring

3:09:41.200 --> 3:09:46.200
 and through that kind of process adapted their environment.

3:09:49.920 --> 3:09:51.880
 Lex, you mentioned earlier about

3:09:51.880 --> 3:09:53.680
 you're asking tough questions

3:09:53.680 --> 3:09:56.640
 and people pushing you to ask tough questions.

3:09:56.640 --> 3:09:57.680
 Is it okay if I just?

3:09:57.680 --> 3:10:01.240
 So you said, have done this as I've read about.

3:10:01.240 --> 3:10:03.400
 As I've read about on the internet, yeah.

3:10:03.400 --> 3:10:06.280
 All I'm saying, as a person sitting with you,

3:10:06.280 --> 3:10:11.280
 to people who would be open minded in experimenting

3:10:11.360 --> 3:10:13.680
 of, as I've read about, to reality,

3:10:13.680 --> 3:10:18.680
 what I would say is Lex Friedman is handsome, charming.

3:10:19.880 --> 3:10:23.960
 He's really a great guy.

3:10:23.960 --> 3:10:24.800
 I'm sorry to interrupt.

3:10:24.800 --> 3:10:26.760
 Thank you, I appreciate that.

3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:28.720
 So I was reading about this last night.

3:10:28.720 --> 3:10:30.080
 I was gonna tweet it, but then I'm like,

3:10:30.080 --> 3:10:32.360
 this is going to be misinterpreted.

3:10:32.360 --> 3:10:36.080
 But this is why I like podcasts,

3:10:36.080 --> 3:10:38.160
 because I can say stuff like this.

3:10:40.160 --> 3:10:45.160
 It's kind of incredible to me that the average human male

3:10:45.480 --> 3:10:50.480
 produces 500 billion plus sperm cells in their lifetime.

3:10:52.760 --> 3:10:55.280
 Each one of those are genetically unique.

3:10:57.360 --> 3:10:59.880
 They can produce unique humans.

3:10:59.880 --> 3:11:01.840
 Each one of them, 500 billion,

3:11:01.840 --> 3:11:06.440
 there's 100 billion people who's ever lived.

3:11:06.440 --> 3:11:09.400
 Maybe 110, whatever, whatever the number is.

3:11:09.400 --> 3:11:12.360
 So it's five times the number of people who ever lived

3:11:12.360 --> 3:11:17.360
 is produced by each male of genetic information.

3:11:18.400 --> 3:11:20.760
 So those are all possible trajectories of lives

3:11:20.760 --> 3:11:22.400
 that could have lived.

3:11:22.400 --> 3:11:25.520
 Those are all little people that could have been.

3:11:25.520 --> 3:11:28.160
 And all the possible stories.

3:11:28.160 --> 3:11:31.040
 All the Hitlers and Einsteins

3:11:31.040 --> 3:11:32.240
 that could have been created.

3:11:32.240 --> 3:11:34.160
 And all that, I mean, I don't know,

3:11:34.160 --> 3:11:38.320
 this kind of, you're painting this possible future,

3:11:38.320 --> 3:11:40.720
 and we get to see only one little string of that.

3:11:40.720 --> 3:11:43.400
 I mean, I suppose the magic of that

3:11:43.400 --> 3:11:47.320
 is also captured by the, in the space of physics,

3:11:47.320 --> 3:11:49.720
 having multiple dimensions

3:11:49.720 --> 3:11:53.440
 and the many worlds hypothesis of quantum mechanics,

3:11:53.440 --> 3:11:57.760
 the interpretation that we're basically just,

3:11:57.760 --> 3:12:02.280
 at every point, there's an infinite offspring

3:12:02.280 --> 3:12:04.760
 of universes that are created.

3:12:04.760 --> 3:12:06.720
 But I don't know, that's just like a magic

3:12:06.720 --> 3:12:10.840
 of this game of genetics that we're playing.

3:12:11.800 --> 3:12:15.240
 And the winning sperm is not the fastest.

3:12:16.680 --> 3:12:19.400
 The winning sperm is basically the luckiest,

3:12:19.400 --> 3:12:21.080
 has the right timing.

3:12:21.080 --> 3:12:24.880
 So it's not, I also got into this whole,

3:12:24.880 --> 3:12:29.400
 I started reading papers about like,

3:12:29.400 --> 3:12:30.680
 is there something to be said

3:12:30.680 --> 3:12:34.040
 about who wins the race, right, genetically?

3:12:34.040 --> 3:12:36.040
 So it's fascinating, because there's studies

3:12:36.040 --> 3:12:38.480
 in animals and so on to answer that question,

3:12:38.480 --> 3:12:41.720
 because it's interesting, because I'm a winner, right?

3:12:41.720 --> 3:12:43.720
 I won, I won a race.

3:12:43.720 --> 3:12:46.560
 And so you want to know, what does that say about me

3:12:46.560 --> 3:12:50.760
 in this fascinating genetic race against,

3:12:50.760 --> 3:12:54.320
 I think, what is it, 200 million others, I think.

3:12:54.320 --> 3:12:59.320
 So one pool of sperm cells is about something

3:13:01.080 --> 3:13:04.480
 like 200 million, it could be, yes.

3:13:04.480 --> 3:13:08.040
 But that, millions, I thought it was much lower than that.

3:13:08.040 --> 3:13:13.040
 So like that, those are all brothers and sisters of mine,

3:13:13.360 --> 3:13:16.560
 and I beat them all out, I won.

3:13:16.560 --> 3:13:19.320
 And so it's interesting to know,

3:13:21.280 --> 3:13:24.120
 there's a temptation to say I'm somehow better than them,

3:13:24.120 --> 3:13:28.320
 right, and now that goes into the next stage

3:13:28.320 --> 3:13:31.800
 of something we're deeply thinking about,

3:13:33.160 --> 3:13:38.160
 which is if we have more control now

3:13:38.800 --> 3:13:43.800
 over the winning genetic code that becomes offspring,

3:13:44.800 --> 3:13:46.600
 if we have first not even control,

3:13:46.600 --> 3:13:50.280
 just information and then control,

3:13:50.280 --> 3:13:53.160
 what do you think that world looks like

3:13:53.160 --> 3:13:54.960
 from a biological perspective

3:13:54.960 --> 3:13:56.520
 and from an ethical perspective

3:13:56.520 --> 3:14:00.760
 when we start getting more information and more control?

3:14:00.760 --> 3:14:02.320
 Yeah, great question.

3:14:02.320 --> 3:14:05.880
 So first, on the sperm, there can be up to

3:14:05.880 --> 3:14:10.600
 about 1.2 billion sperm cells in a male ejaculation.

3:14:10.600 --> 3:14:13.200
 So as I mentioned in Hacking Darwin,

3:14:13.200 --> 3:14:15.400
 male sperm, it's kind of a dime a dozen

3:14:15.400 --> 3:14:18.400
 with all the guys in all the world

3:14:18.400 --> 3:14:20.320
 just doing whatever they do with it.

3:14:20.320 --> 3:14:25.320
 And it's an open question how competitive,

3:14:25.640 --> 3:14:27.800
 I mean, there is an element of luck

3:14:27.800 --> 3:14:31.120
 and there is an element of competition,

3:14:31.120 --> 3:14:36.120
 and it's an open question how much that competition

3:14:36.120 --> 3:14:39.600
 impacts the outcome or whether it's just luck,

3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:42.200
 but my guess is there's some combination

3:14:42.200 --> 3:14:44.560
 of fitness and luck.

3:14:44.560 --> 3:14:48.000
 But you're absolutely right that all of those other

3:14:48.000 --> 3:14:51.280
 sperm cells in the ejaculation,

3:14:51.280 --> 3:14:55.800
 if that's how the union of the sperm and egg is happening,

3:14:55.800 --> 3:14:59.360
 all of them represent a different future.

3:14:59.360 --> 3:15:03.800
 And there's a wonderful book called Invisible Cities

3:15:03.800 --> 3:15:08.080
 by Italo Calvino, and he even talks about a city

3:15:08.080 --> 3:15:10.280
 as something like this where everybody,

3:15:10.280 --> 3:15:12.160
 you have your life,

3:15:12.160 --> 3:15:14.240
 but then you have all these alternate lives

3:15:14.240 --> 3:15:16.480
 and every time you make any decision,

3:15:16.480 --> 3:15:19.280
 you're kind of, and so, but in this Invisible Cities,

3:15:19.280 --> 3:15:23.280
 there's a little string that goes toward that alternate life

3:15:23.280 --> 3:15:25.520
 and then the city becomes this weaving

3:15:25.520 --> 3:15:28.960
 of all the strings of people's real lives

3:15:28.960 --> 3:15:31.680
 and the alternate lives that they could have taken

3:15:31.680 --> 3:15:34.000
 had they made any other different steps.

3:15:34.000 --> 3:15:37.600
 So that part, it's like a deep philosophical question.

3:15:37.600 --> 3:15:39.480
 It's not just for us, it's for all of,

3:15:39.480 --> 3:15:43.280
 I mean, it's baked into evolutionary biology.

3:15:43.280 --> 3:15:45.280
 It's just what are the different strategies

3:15:45.280 --> 3:15:48.400
 for different species to achieve fitness?

3:15:48.400 --> 3:15:52.000
 And there's some of the different corals or other fish

3:15:52.000 --> 3:15:55.320
 where they just kind of release the eggs into the water

3:15:55.320 --> 3:15:58.880
 and there's all different kinds of ways.

3:15:58.880 --> 3:16:03.120
 And then you're right in my book, Hacking Darwin,

3:16:03.120 --> 3:16:04.840
 and it's the full title is Hacking Darwin,

3:16:04.840 --> 3:16:07.440
 Genetic Engineering and the Future of Humanity.

3:16:08.600 --> 3:16:12.360
 I kind of go deep into exploring

3:16:12.360 --> 3:16:15.360
 the big picture implications of the future

3:16:15.360 --> 3:16:17.920
 of human reproduction.

3:16:17.920 --> 3:16:20.880
 We are already participating

3:16:20.880 --> 3:16:23.400
 in a revolutionary transformation,

3:16:23.400 --> 3:16:26.320
 not just because of the diagnostics that we have,

3:16:26.320 --> 3:16:29.440
 things like ultrasound, but because now

3:16:29.440 --> 3:16:31.960
 an increasing number of us are being born

3:16:31.960 --> 3:16:33.800
 through in vitro fertilization,

3:16:33.800 --> 3:16:36.520
 which means the eggs are extracted from the mother,

3:16:36.520 --> 3:16:41.160
 they're fertilized by the father's sperm in vitro in a lab,

3:16:41.160 --> 3:16:45.080
 and then reimplanted in the mother.

3:16:45.080 --> 3:16:48.800
 On top of that, there's a somewhat newer,

3:16:48.800 --> 3:16:52.720
 but still now older technology

3:16:52.720 --> 3:16:55.520
 called preimplantation genetic testing.

3:16:55.520 --> 3:16:58.600
 And so as everyone knows from high school biology,

3:16:58.600 --> 3:17:01.320
 you have the fertilized egg,

3:17:01.320 --> 3:17:03.920
 and then it goes one cell to two cells

3:17:03.920 --> 3:17:05.240
 to four to eight and whatever.

3:17:05.240 --> 3:17:09.560
 And after around five days in this PGT process,

3:17:09.560 --> 3:17:12.160
 a few cells are extracted.

3:17:12.160 --> 3:17:15.400
 So let's say you have 10 fertilized eggs,

3:17:15.400 --> 3:17:18.480
 early stage embryos, a few cells are extracted from each,

3:17:18.480 --> 3:17:21.200
 and those cells, if they would,

3:17:21.200 --> 3:17:22.120
 the ones that are extracted

3:17:22.120 --> 3:17:25.000
 would end up becoming the placenta.

3:17:25.000 --> 3:17:28.600
 But every one of our cells has, other than a few,

3:17:28.600 --> 3:17:30.960
 has our full genome.

3:17:30.960 --> 3:17:33.040
 And so then you sequence those cells

3:17:33.040 --> 3:17:36.400
 and with preimplantation genetic testing now,

3:17:36.400 --> 3:17:41.400
 what you can do is you can screen out deadly single gel,

3:17:41.520 --> 3:17:44.280
 a single gene mutation disorders,

3:17:44.280 --> 3:17:47.120
 things that could be deadly or life ruining.

3:17:47.120 --> 3:17:49.400
 And so people use it to determine

3:17:49.400 --> 3:17:53.240
 which of those 10 early stage embryos

3:17:53.240 --> 3:17:55.680
 to implant in a mother.

3:17:55.680 --> 3:17:59.000
 As we shift towards a much greater understanding

3:17:59.000 --> 3:18:01.480
 of genetics, and that is part of our,

3:18:01.480 --> 3:18:04.160
 just the broader genetics revolution,

3:18:04.160 --> 3:18:07.760
 but within that, in our transition from personalized

3:18:07.760 --> 3:18:10.400
 to precision healthcare, more and more of us

3:18:10.400 --> 3:18:12.400
 are going to have our whole genome sequenced

3:18:12.400 --> 3:18:13.920
 because it's gonna be the foundation

3:18:13.920 --> 3:18:16.000
 of getting personalized healthcare.

3:18:16.000 --> 3:18:19.360
 We're going to have already millions, but very soon,

3:18:19.360 --> 3:18:22.840
 billions of people who've had their whole genome sequenced.

3:18:22.840 --> 3:18:24.920
 And then we'll have big databases

3:18:24.920 --> 3:18:27.640
 of people's genetic genotypic information

3:18:27.640 --> 3:18:30.040
 and life or phenotypic information.

3:18:30.040 --> 3:18:32.280
 And using, coming into your area,

3:18:32.280 --> 3:18:35.120
 our tools of machine learning and data analytics,

3:18:35.120 --> 3:18:38.360
 we're going to be able to increasingly understand

3:18:38.360 --> 3:18:41.160
 patterns of genetic expression, even though we're all.

3:18:41.160 --> 3:18:44.320
 So predict how the genetic information will get expressed.

3:18:44.320 --> 3:18:45.920
 Correct. Yeah.

3:18:45.920 --> 3:18:48.880
 Never perfectly perhaps, but more and more,

3:18:48.880 --> 3:18:50.440
 always more and more.

3:18:50.440 --> 3:18:54.480
 And so with that information, we aren't going to just be,

3:18:54.480 --> 3:18:59.480
 even now, we aren't going to just be selecting based on

3:18:59.480 --> 3:19:02.120
 which of these 10 early stage embryos

3:19:02.120 --> 3:19:04.640
 is carrying a deadly genetic disorder,

3:19:04.640 --> 3:19:06.880
 but we can, we'll be able to know everything

3:19:06.880 --> 3:19:11.880
 that can be partly or entirely predicted by genetics.

3:19:12.240 --> 3:19:14.560
 And there's a lot of our humanity

3:19:14.560 --> 3:19:17.200
 that fits into that category.

3:19:17.200 --> 3:19:22.200
 And certainly simple traits like height and eye color

3:19:22.360 --> 3:19:23.760
 and things like that.

3:19:23.760 --> 3:19:25.400
 I mean, height is not at all simple,

3:19:25.400 --> 3:19:28.760
 but it's, if you have good nutrition,

3:19:28.760 --> 3:19:31.320
 it's entirely or mostly genetic.

3:19:31.320 --> 3:19:34.280
 But even personality traits and personality styles,

3:19:34.280 --> 3:19:37.360
 there are a lot of things that we see just as the experience,

3:19:37.360 --> 3:19:42.000
 the beauty of life that are partly have a genetic foundation.

3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:47.000
 And so whatever part of these traits are definable

3:19:47.240 --> 3:19:49.880
 and influenced by genetics,

3:19:49.880 --> 3:19:53.120
 we're going to have greater and greater predictability

3:19:53.120 --> 3:19:54.520
 within a range.

3:19:54.520 --> 3:19:59.520
 And so selecting those embryos will be informed

3:19:59.880 --> 3:20:02.440
 by that kind of knowledge.

3:20:02.440 --> 3:20:04.520
 And that's why in Hacking Darwin,

3:20:04.520 --> 3:20:09.280
 I talk about embryo selection as being a key driver

3:20:09.280 --> 3:20:11.560
 of the future of human evolution.

3:20:11.560 --> 3:20:15.240
 But then on top of that, there is in 2012,

3:20:15.240 --> 3:20:19.760
 Shinya Yamanaka, an amazing Japanese scientist

3:20:19.760 --> 3:20:22.960
 won the Nobel Prize for developing a process

3:20:22.960 --> 3:20:26.400
 for creating what are called induced pluripotent stem cells,

3:20:26.400 --> 3:20:27.640
 IPS cells.

3:20:27.640 --> 3:20:31.760
 And what IPS cells are is you can induce an adult cell

3:20:31.760 --> 3:20:35.200
 to go back in evolutionary time and become a stem cell.

3:20:35.200 --> 3:20:39.600
 And a stem cell is like when we're a fertilized egg,

3:20:39.600 --> 3:20:42.640
 like our entire blueprint is in that one cell

3:20:42.640 --> 3:20:44.160
 and that cell can be anything,

3:20:44.160 --> 3:20:48.120
 but then it starts to, our cells start to specialize.

3:20:48.120 --> 3:20:50.440
 And that's why we have skin cells and blood cells

3:20:50.440 --> 3:20:51.560
 and all the different types of things.

3:20:51.560 --> 3:20:54.640
 So with the Yamanaka process,

3:20:54.640 --> 3:20:59.640
 we can induce an adult cell to become a stem cell.

3:20:59.880 --> 3:21:02.960
 So the relevance to this story is what you can do.

3:21:02.960 --> 3:21:05.080
 And it works now in animal models.

3:21:05.080 --> 3:21:08.240
 And as far as I know, it hasn't yet been done in humans,

3:21:08.240 --> 3:21:11.080
 but it works pretty well in animal models.

3:21:11.080 --> 3:21:12.280
 You take any adult cell,

3:21:12.280 --> 3:21:15.000
 but skin cells are probably the easiest.

3:21:15.960 --> 3:21:19.760
 You induce this skin cell into a stem cell.

3:21:19.760 --> 3:21:21.640
 And if you just take a little skin graft,

3:21:21.640 --> 3:21:23.760
 it would have millions of cells.

3:21:23.760 --> 3:21:26.760
 You induce those skin cells into stem cells.

3:21:26.760 --> 3:21:31.480
 Then you induce those stem cells into egg precursor cells.

3:21:31.480 --> 3:21:35.880
 Then you induce those egg precursor cells into eggs,

3:21:35.880 --> 3:21:37.120
 egg cells.

3:21:37.120 --> 3:21:41.080
 Then because we have this massive overabundance

3:21:41.080 --> 3:21:45.280
 of male sperm, then you could fertilize,

3:21:45.280 --> 3:21:49.600
 let's call it 10,000 of the mother's eggs.

3:21:49.600 --> 3:21:52.680
 So you have 10,000 eggs, which are fertilized.

3:21:52.680 --> 3:21:53.680
 Sounds like a party.

3:21:53.680 --> 3:21:54.520
 Yeah.

3:21:54.520 --> 3:21:58.160
 Then you have an automated process

3:21:58.160 --> 3:22:00.560
 for what I mentioned before

3:22:00.560 --> 3:22:02.280
 in preimplantation genetic testing,

3:22:02.280 --> 3:22:04.080
 you grow them all for five days,

3:22:04.080 --> 3:22:07.080
 you extract a few cells from each, you test them.

3:22:07.080 --> 3:22:09.000
 And that's why I had a piece in the New York Times

3:22:09.000 --> 3:22:09.920
 a couple of years ago,

3:22:09.920 --> 3:22:12.880
 imagining what it would be like to go to a fertility clinic

3:22:12.880 --> 3:22:14.560
 in the year 2050.

3:22:14.560 --> 3:22:15.400
 And the choice is not.

3:22:15.400 --> 3:22:16.400
 No humans involved.

3:22:16.400 --> 3:22:17.240
 Yeah.

3:22:17.240 --> 3:22:19.400
 Well, no, no, there are, but the choice is not,

3:22:19.400 --> 3:22:22.760
 do you want a kid who does or doesn't have,

3:22:22.760 --> 3:22:25.400
 let's call it Tay Sachs.

3:22:25.400 --> 3:22:28.600
 It's a whole range of possibilities,

3:22:28.600 --> 3:22:31.600
 including very intimate traits

3:22:33.360 --> 3:22:35.880
 like height, IQ, personality style.

3:22:35.880 --> 3:22:37.840
 It doesn't mean you can predict everything,

3:22:37.840 --> 3:22:41.320
 but it means there will be increasing predictability.

3:22:41.320 --> 3:22:45.200
 So if you're choosing from 10,000 eggs,

3:22:45.200 --> 3:22:47.520
 fertilized eggs, early stage embryos,

3:22:47.520 --> 3:22:49.520
 that's a lot of choice.

3:22:49.520 --> 3:22:52.040
 And on top of that,

3:22:52.040 --> 3:22:57.040
 then we have the new technology of human genome editing.

3:22:57.840 --> 3:23:00.040
 Many people have heard of CRISPR,

3:23:00.040 --> 3:23:02.600
 but what I say is if you think of human genome editing

3:23:02.600 --> 3:23:07.320
 as a pie, sorry, human genome engineering as a pie,

3:23:07.320 --> 3:23:08.920
 genome editing is a slice

3:23:08.920 --> 3:23:11.360
 and CRISPR is just a sliver of that slice.

3:23:11.360 --> 3:23:13.840
 It's just one of our tools for genome editing

3:23:13.840 --> 3:23:16.440
 and things are getting better and better.

3:23:16.440 --> 3:23:20.320
 Then you can go in and change.

3:23:20.320 --> 3:23:23.000
 Let's say, I mean, again, it starts simple.

3:23:23.000 --> 3:23:24.640
 A small number of genes,

3:23:24.640 --> 3:23:27.680
 let's say you've selected from among the one of 10

3:23:27.680 --> 3:23:29.840
 or the one of 10,000,

3:23:29.840 --> 3:23:31.160
 but there are a number of changes

3:23:31.160 --> 3:23:33.760
 that you would like to make to achieve some kind of outcome.

3:23:33.760 --> 3:23:36.080
 And biology is incredibly complex

3:23:36.080 --> 3:23:38.440
 and it's not that one gene does one thing.

3:23:38.440 --> 3:23:42.400
 One gene does probably a lot of things simultaneously,

3:23:42.400 --> 3:23:45.280
 which is why the decision about changing one gene

3:23:45.280 --> 3:23:48.280
 if it's causing deathly harm is easier

3:23:48.280 --> 3:23:51.880
 than when we think about the complexity of biology.

3:23:51.880 --> 3:23:52.720
 But then the machine learning

3:23:52.720 --> 3:23:54.560
 gets better and better at predicting

3:23:54.560 --> 3:23:55.840
 the full complexity of biology.

3:23:55.840 --> 3:23:58.280
 So as one gets better,

3:23:58.280 --> 3:24:03.000
 then you're editing your ability to reliably edit

3:24:03.000 --> 3:24:04.880
 such that the conclusions are predictable,

3:24:04.880 --> 3:24:05.720
 it gets better and better.

3:24:05.720 --> 3:24:07.240
 So those two are coupled together.

3:24:07.240 --> 3:24:08.840
 You got it, that's exactly it.

3:24:08.840 --> 3:24:11.160
 And then, so that's why, and people would say,

3:24:11.160 --> 3:24:12.960
 well, that, I mean, I wrote about that

3:24:12.960 --> 3:24:15.480
 in my two science fiction novels,

3:24:15.480 --> 3:24:18.200
 Genesis Code and Eternal Sonata years ago,

3:24:18.200 --> 3:24:20.760
 and especially with Genesis Code, I wrote about that.

3:24:20.760 --> 3:24:22.880
 And as a sci fi,

3:24:22.880 --> 3:24:25.760
 and I had actually testified before Congress,

3:24:25.760 --> 3:24:27.320
 but now 15 years ago saying,

3:24:27.320 --> 3:24:30.440
 here's what the future looks like.

3:24:30.440 --> 3:24:35.440
 But even I, and in my first edition of Hacking Darwin,

3:24:35.440 --> 3:24:38.560
 when it was already in production,

3:24:38.560 --> 3:24:41.840
 and then in November 2018,

3:24:41.840 --> 3:24:46.840
 this scientist, Hojong Kui, announced in Hong Kong

3:24:47.240 --> 3:24:50.320
 that the world's first two, and later three,

3:24:50.320 --> 3:24:51.720
 CRISPR babies had been born,

3:24:51.720 --> 3:24:53.760
 which he had genetically altered,

3:24:53.760 --> 3:24:57.920
 and misguided, in my view, and dangerous view,

3:24:57.920 --> 3:25:02.920
 dangerous goal of making it so they would have

3:25:02.920 --> 3:25:07.040
 increased resistance to HIV.

3:25:07.040 --> 3:25:09.200
 And so I called my publisher,

3:25:09.200 --> 3:25:11.720
 and I said, I've got good news and bad news.

3:25:11.720 --> 3:25:13.000
 I'll start with the bad news,

3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:17.080
 is that the world's first CRISPR babies have been born,

3:25:17.080 --> 3:25:21.000
 and so we need to pull my book out of production,

3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:22.800
 because you can't have a book on the future

3:25:22.800 --> 3:25:24.840
 of human genetic engineering,

3:25:24.840 --> 3:25:27.400
 and have it not mention the first CRISPR babies

3:25:27.400 --> 3:25:28.680
 that had been born.

3:25:28.680 --> 3:25:31.480
 But the good news is, in the book,

3:25:31.480 --> 3:25:34.440
 I had predicted that it's going to happen,

3:25:34.440 --> 3:25:37.760
 and it's going to happen in China, and here's why.

3:25:37.760 --> 3:25:42.200
 And all we need to do is add a few more sentences,

3:25:42.200 --> 3:25:43.360
 and that was the hardback,

3:25:43.360 --> 3:25:45.240
 and then I updated it more in the paperback,

3:25:45.240 --> 3:25:48.760
 saying, and it happened, and it was announced on this day.

3:25:48.760 --> 3:25:50.080
 Yeah.

3:25:50.080 --> 3:25:52.960
 Well, then let's fast forward.

3:25:52.960 --> 3:25:57.320
 Given your predictions are slowly becoming reality,

3:25:59.680 --> 3:26:01.240
 let's talk about some philosophy,

3:26:01.240 --> 3:26:02.600
 and ethics, I suppose.

3:26:03.640 --> 3:26:07.800
 So I can, I'm not being too self deprecating here,

3:26:07.800 --> 3:26:12.240
 and saying if my parents had the choice,

3:26:14.360 --> 3:26:18.400
 I would be probably less likely to come out the winner.

3:26:18.400 --> 3:26:23.400
 We're all weird, and I'm certainly a very distinctly

3:26:23.440 --> 3:26:26.920
 weird specimen of the human species.

3:26:26.920 --> 3:26:29.760
 I can give the full long list of flaws,

3:26:29.760 --> 3:26:33.320
 and we can be very poetic of saying those are features,

3:26:33.320 --> 3:26:36.320
 and so on, but they're not.

3:26:37.400 --> 3:26:39.000
 If you look at the menu.

3:26:40.160 --> 3:26:42.640
 Again, for these women who are listening,

3:26:42.640 --> 3:26:43.760
 apropos of your thing,

3:26:43.760 --> 3:26:47.280
 they're all kind of charming individualities.

3:26:47.280 --> 3:26:50.240
 Yes, that's beautiful, that's one, yes, thank you.

3:26:50.240 --> 3:26:52.960
 But anyway, but on the full sort of individual,

3:26:52.960 --> 3:26:55.040
 let's say IQ alone, right?

3:26:55.040 --> 3:27:00.040
 That what do we do about a world

3:27:02.800 --> 3:27:07.800
 where IQ could be selected on a menu

3:27:09.080 --> 3:27:10.480
 when you're having children?

3:27:13.680 --> 3:27:15.680
 What concerns you about that world?

3:27:15.680 --> 3:27:17.920
 What excites you about that world?

3:27:17.920 --> 3:27:22.920
 Are there certain metrics that excite you more than others?

3:27:25.240 --> 3:27:28.480
 IQ has been a source of,

3:27:31.440 --> 3:27:36.120
 I don't know, I'm not sure IQ as a measure,

3:27:36.120 --> 3:27:40.880
 flawed as it is, has been used to celebrate

3:27:40.880 --> 3:27:43.680
 the successes of the human species

3:27:43.680 --> 3:27:47.120
 nearly as much as has been used to divide people,

3:27:47.120 --> 3:27:49.560
 to say negative things about people,

3:27:51.680 --> 3:27:54.120
 to make negative claims about people.

3:27:54.120 --> 3:27:57.040
 And in that same way, it seems like

3:27:57.040 --> 3:28:01.480
 when there's a selection, a genetic selection based on IQ,

3:28:01.480 --> 3:28:05.160
 you can start now having classes of citizenry,

3:28:05.160 --> 3:28:09.920
 like further divide, you know, the rich get richer.

3:28:09.920 --> 3:28:12.120
 You know, it'll be very rich people

3:28:12.120 --> 3:28:16.440
 that'll be able to do kind of fine selection of IQ

3:28:16.440 --> 3:28:21.440
 and they will start forming these classes

3:28:22.040 --> 3:28:23.960
 of super intelligent people.

3:28:23.960 --> 3:28:26.320
 And those super intelligent people in their minds

3:28:26.320 --> 3:28:27.760
 would of course be the right people

3:28:27.760 --> 3:28:30.560
 to be making global authoritarian decisions

3:28:30.560 --> 3:28:33.960
 about everybody else, all the usual aspects of human nature,

3:28:33.960 --> 3:28:38.280
 but now magnified with the new tools of technology.

3:28:38.280 --> 3:28:42.480
 Anyway, all that to say is what's exciting to you?

3:28:42.480 --> 3:28:44.280
 What's concerning to you?

3:28:44.280 --> 3:28:48.880
 It's a great question and just stepping into the IQ,

3:28:48.880 --> 3:28:51.880
 we'll call it a quagmire for now,

3:28:51.880 --> 3:28:56.880
 it raises a lot of big issues which are complicated.

3:28:57.600 --> 3:29:02.200
 Maybe you've listened to Sam Harris's interview

3:29:02.200 --> 3:29:05.000
 with Charles Murray and then that spawned

3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:10.000
 kind of a whole industry of debate.

3:29:10.000 --> 3:29:13.320
 So first, just the background of IQ

3:29:13.320 --> 3:29:16.400
 and it's from the early 20th century

3:29:16.400 --> 3:29:19.080
 and there was the idea that we can measure

3:29:19.080 --> 3:29:21.200
 people's general intelligence

3:29:21.200 --> 3:29:23.700
 and there are so many different kinds of intelligence.

3:29:23.700 --> 3:29:25.640
 This was measuring a specific thing.

3:29:25.640 --> 3:29:30.400
 So my feeling is that IQ is not a perfect measure

3:29:30.400 --> 3:29:33.400
 of intelligence, but it's a perfect measure of IQ.

3:29:33.400 --> 3:29:35.440
 Like it's measuring what it's measuring,

3:29:35.440 --> 3:29:40.000
 but that thing correlates to a lot of things

3:29:40.000 --> 3:29:43.440
 which are rewarded in our society.

3:29:43.440 --> 3:29:47.680
 So every study of IQ has shown that people

3:29:47.680 --> 3:29:51.080
 with higher IQs, they make more money,

3:29:51.080 --> 3:29:53.920
 they live longer, they have more stable relationships.

3:29:53.920 --> 3:29:56.600
 I mean, that could be something in the testing,

3:29:56.600 --> 3:30:00.560
 but as Sam Harris has talked about a lot,

3:30:00.560 --> 3:30:03.840
 you could line up all of these kind of IQ

3:30:03.840 --> 3:30:07.160
 and IQ like tests correlate with each other.

3:30:07.160 --> 3:30:10.280
 So the people who score high on one, score high on all

3:30:10.280 --> 3:30:15.040
 of them and people think that IQ tests are like a thing

3:30:15.040 --> 3:30:18.800
 like the Earl of Dorchester is coming for dinner.

3:30:18.800 --> 3:30:21.320
 Does he have two forks or three forks

3:30:21.320 --> 3:30:22.160
 or something like that?

3:30:22.160 --> 3:30:24.420
 It's not that a lot of them are things

3:30:24.420 --> 3:30:27.820
 that I think a lot of us would recognize are relevant.

3:30:27.820 --> 3:30:30.640
 Just like how much stuff can you memorize?

3:30:30.640 --> 3:30:33.560
 If you see some shapes, how can you position them

3:30:33.560 --> 3:30:36.000
 and things like that.

3:30:36.000 --> 3:30:38.720
 And so IQ, I mean, it really hit its stride

3:30:38.720 --> 3:30:40.720
 and certainly in the second world war

3:30:40.720 --> 3:30:43.560
 when our governments were processing a lot of people

3:30:43.560 --> 3:30:47.080
 and trying to figure out who to put in what jobs.

3:30:47.080 --> 3:30:48.840
 So that's the starting point.

3:30:48.840 --> 3:30:51.940
 Let me start first with the negatives.

3:30:53.000 --> 3:30:56.680
 That our societies, when we talk about diversity

3:30:56.680 --> 3:31:00.440
 in Darwinian terms, it's not like diversity

3:31:00.440 --> 3:31:01.920
 is from Darwinian terms.

3:31:01.920 --> 3:31:05.840
 Oh, wouldn't it be nice if we have some moths

3:31:05.840 --> 3:31:08.300
 of different colors because it'll be really fun

3:31:08.300 --> 3:31:10.120
 to have different colored moths.

3:31:10.120 --> 3:31:14.680
 Diversity is the sole survival strategy of our species

3:31:14.680 --> 3:31:15.920
 and of every species.

3:31:15.920 --> 3:31:20.920
 And it's impossible to predict what diversity

3:31:21.100 --> 3:31:22.880
 is going to be rewarded.

3:31:22.880 --> 3:31:25.380
 And I've said this before, if you went down

3:31:25.380 --> 3:31:29.560
 and you spoke T. rex and you spoke to the dinosaurs

3:31:29.560 --> 3:31:31.840
 and said, hey, you can select your kids,

3:31:31.840 --> 3:31:33.380
 what criteria do you want?

3:31:33.380 --> 3:31:37.560
 And they say, oh, yeah, sharp teeth, cruel fangs,

3:31:37.560 --> 3:31:41.220
 roar, whatever it is that makes you a great T. rex.

3:31:42.380 --> 3:31:46.240
 But the answer from an evolutionary perspective,

3:31:46.240 --> 3:31:48.200
 from an earth perspective was, oh, it's much better

3:31:48.200 --> 3:31:50.800
 to be like a cockroach or an alligator

3:31:50.800 --> 3:31:53.640
 or some little nothing or a little shrew

3:31:54.640 --> 3:31:57.440
 because the dinosaurs are gonna get wiped out

3:31:57.440 --> 3:31:58.840
 when the asteroid hits.

3:31:58.840 --> 3:32:01.900
 And so there's no better or worse in evolution.

3:32:01.900 --> 3:32:05.800
 There's just better or worse suited for a given environment.

3:32:05.800 --> 3:32:07.640
 And when that environment changes,

3:32:07.640 --> 3:32:11.600
 the best suited person from the old system

3:32:11.600 --> 3:32:14.040
 could be the worst suited person for the new one.

3:32:14.040 --> 3:32:17.060
 So if we start selecting for the things

3:32:17.060 --> 3:32:21.720
 that we value the most, including things like IQ,

3:32:21.720 --> 3:32:26.320
 but even disease resistance, I mean, this is well known,

3:32:26.320 --> 3:32:31.320
 but people who are recessive carrier of sickle cell disease

3:32:32.240 --> 3:32:34.160
 have increased resistance to malaria,

3:32:34.160 --> 3:32:37.480
 which is the biggest reason why that trait

3:32:37.480 --> 3:32:41.400
 hasn't just disappeared given how deadly

3:32:41.400 --> 3:32:43.040
 sickle cell disease is.

3:32:43.880 --> 3:32:46.080
 Biology is incredibly complex.

3:32:46.080 --> 3:32:49.360
 We understand such a tiny percentage of it

3:32:49.360 --> 3:32:50.960
 that we need to have, in your words,

3:32:50.960 --> 3:32:53.880
 just a level of humility.

3:32:53.880 --> 3:32:56.520
 There are huge equity issues as you've articulated.

3:32:56.520 --> 3:32:59.720
 Let's just say that it is the case that in our society,

3:32:59.720 --> 3:33:04.720
 IQ and IQ like traits are highly rewarded.

3:33:05.080 --> 3:33:08.120
 There is an equity issue, but it works in both ways.

3:33:08.120 --> 3:33:11.120
 Because my guess is, let's just say that we had a society

3:33:11.120 --> 3:33:13.400
 where we were doing genome sequencing

3:33:13.400 --> 3:33:15.360
 of everybody who was born.

3:33:15.360 --> 3:33:18.740
 And we had some predictive model to predict IQ.

3:33:18.740 --> 3:33:22.360
 And we had decided as a society that IQ

3:33:22.360 --> 3:33:24.320
 was going to be what we were going to select for.

3:33:24.320 --> 3:33:26.240
 We were gonna put the highest IQ people

3:33:26.240 --> 3:33:28.640
 in these different roles.

3:33:28.640 --> 3:33:31.520
 I guarantee you the people in those roles

3:33:31.520 --> 3:33:36.000
 would not be the people who are legacy admissions to Harvard.

3:33:36.000 --> 3:33:40.800
 They would very likely be people who are born in slums,

3:33:40.800 --> 3:33:44.080
 people who are born with no opportunity or in refugee camps

3:33:44.080 --> 3:33:49.080
 who are just wasting away because we've thrown them away.

3:33:49.080 --> 3:33:54.080
 And so it's an easy, like it's the idea of just being able

3:33:54.880 --> 3:33:57.920
 to look under the hood of our humanity

3:33:57.920 --> 3:34:01.520
 is really scary for everybody.

3:34:01.520 --> 3:34:02.360
 And it should be.

3:34:02.360 --> 3:34:05.400
 I mean, I'm also an Ashkenazi Jew.

3:34:05.400 --> 3:34:07.360
 My father was born in Austria.

3:34:07.360 --> 3:34:10.400
 My father and grandparents came here as refugees.

3:34:10.400 --> 3:34:14.120
 After the war, most of that side of the family was killed.

3:34:14.120 --> 3:34:19.120
 So I get what it means to be on the other,

3:34:19.120 --> 3:34:19.960
 I mean, you said you're reading Mein Kampf,

3:34:19.960 --> 3:34:22.120
 on the other side of the story when someone said,

3:34:22.120 --> 3:34:25.240
 well, here's what's good and you're not good.

3:34:25.240 --> 3:34:29.080
 And therefore you're, so I totally get that.

3:34:29.080 --> 3:34:34.080
 Having said that, I do believe that we're moving toward

3:34:35.080 --> 3:34:37.640
 a new way of procreating.

3:34:37.640 --> 3:34:40.680
 And we're going to have to decide what are the values

3:34:40.680 --> 3:34:45.120
 that we would like to realize through that process?

3:34:45.120 --> 3:34:48.240
 Is it randomness, which is what we currently have now,

3:34:48.240 --> 3:34:49.760
 which is not totally random

3:34:49.760 --> 3:34:52.040
 because we have a sort of mating through colleges

3:34:52.040 --> 3:34:54.120
 and other things.

3:34:54.120 --> 3:34:54.960
 But if it's.

3:34:54.960 --> 3:34:55.800
 Wait, mating through what?

3:34:55.800 --> 3:34:56.640
 Colleges?

3:34:56.640 --> 3:35:01.320
 Sort of like if you go, if you go to Harvard or whatever,

3:35:01.320 --> 3:35:05.040
 and your wife also goes to Harvard, it's like, it's.

3:35:05.040 --> 3:35:07.880
 So it's location based mating.

3:35:07.880 --> 3:35:09.800
 Well, it's not location, it's selection.

3:35:09.800 --> 3:35:11.760
 It's like there are selections that are made

3:35:11.760 --> 3:35:14.400
 about who gets to a certain place.

3:35:14.400 --> 3:35:17.360
 And when like, it's like Harvard admissions is a filter.

3:35:17.360 --> 3:35:19.600
 So we're going to have to decide what are the values

3:35:19.600 --> 3:35:21.400
 that we want to realize through this process

3:35:21.400 --> 3:35:24.880
 because diversity has, it's just baked into our biology.

3:35:24.880 --> 3:35:28.360
 We're the first species ever that has the opportunity

3:35:28.360 --> 3:35:32.360
 to make choices about things that were otherwise baked

3:35:32.360 --> 3:35:33.720
 into our biology.

3:35:33.720 --> 3:35:37.520
 And there's a real danger that if we make bad choices,

3:35:37.520 --> 3:35:40.880
 even with good intentions, it could even drive us

3:35:40.880 --> 3:35:45.120
 toward extinction and certainly undermine our humanity.

3:35:45.120 --> 3:35:47.200
 And that's why I always say, and like I said,

3:35:47.200 --> 3:35:50.160
 I'm deeply involved with WHO and other things,

3:35:50.160 --> 3:35:53.040
 that these aren't conversations about science.

3:35:53.040 --> 3:35:54.040
 They're conversations.

3:35:54.040 --> 3:35:56.160
 Science brings us to the conversation,

3:35:56.160 --> 3:35:58.280
 but the conversation is about values and ethics.

3:35:58.280 --> 3:36:00.480
 As you described, that world is wide open.

3:36:00.480 --> 3:36:04.920
 It's not even a subtly different world.

3:36:04.920 --> 3:36:06.640
 That world is fundamentally different

3:36:06.640 --> 3:36:09.720
 from anything we understand about life on Earth

3:36:09.720 --> 3:36:14.720
 because natural selection, this random process,

3:36:15.080 --> 3:36:17.800
 is so fundamental how we think about life.

3:36:18.920 --> 3:36:22.360
 Being able to program, I mean, it has a chance to,

3:36:23.360 --> 3:36:25.840
 I mean, it'll probably make my question

3:36:25.840 --> 3:36:29.880
 about the ethical concerns around IQ based selection

3:36:29.880 --> 3:36:34.880
 just meaningless because it'll change the nature of identity.

3:36:37.960 --> 3:36:40.760
 It's possible it will dissolve identity

3:36:41.760 --> 3:36:45.680
 because we take so much pride in all the different

3:36:45.680 --> 3:36:47.760
 characteristics that make us who we are.

3:36:48.640 --> 3:36:51.960
 Whenever you have some control over those characteristics,

3:36:51.960 --> 3:36:54.160
 those characteristics start losing meaning.

3:36:55.200 --> 3:36:58.600
 And what may start gaining meaning is the ideas

3:36:58.600 --> 3:37:00.600
 inside our heads, for example,

3:37:00.600 --> 3:37:05.600
 versus like the details of like,

3:37:05.760 --> 3:37:10.680
 is it a Commodore 64, is it a PC, is it a Mac?

3:37:10.680 --> 3:37:12.760
 It's gonna be less important than the software

3:37:12.760 --> 3:37:14.280
 that runs on it.

3:37:14.280 --> 3:37:17.080
 So we can more and more be operating in the digital space

3:37:17.080 --> 3:37:18.400
 and the identity could be something

3:37:18.400 --> 3:37:20.360
 that borrows multiple bodies.

3:37:20.360 --> 3:37:24.760
 Like the legacy of our ideas may become more important

3:37:24.760 --> 3:37:28.480
 than the details of our physical embodiment.

3:37:28.480 --> 3:37:30.440
 Like it, I mean, I'm saying perhaps

3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:33.720
 ridiculous sounding things, but the point is

3:37:33.720 --> 3:37:38.040
 it will bring up so many new ethical concerns

3:37:38.040 --> 3:37:40.160
 that our narrow minded thinking about

3:37:40.160 --> 3:37:43.720
 the current ethical concerns would not apply.

3:37:43.720 --> 3:37:46.200
 So it's, but it's important to think about

3:37:46.200 --> 3:37:49.160
 all this kind of stuff, like actively.

3:37:49.160 --> 3:37:51.560
 What are the right conversations to be having now?

3:37:51.560 --> 3:37:56.200
 Because it feels like it's an ongoing conversation

3:37:56.200 --> 3:37:59.680
 that then continually evolves, like with NIH involved.

3:37:59.680 --> 3:38:03.400
 Like do you do experiments with animals?

3:38:03.400 --> 3:38:06.200
 Do you build these brain organoids?

3:38:06.200 --> 3:38:08.320
 Do you, like through that process you described

3:38:08.320 --> 3:38:10.640
 with the stem cells, like do you experiment

3:38:10.640 --> 3:38:15.640
 with a bunch of organisms to see how genetic material,

3:38:16.040 --> 3:38:18.080
 what form that actually takes,

3:38:18.080 --> 3:38:19.520
 how to minimize the chance of cancer

3:38:19.520 --> 3:38:20.480
 and all those kinds of things.

3:38:20.480 --> 3:38:22.640
 What are the negative consequences of that?

3:38:22.640 --> 3:38:24.840
 What are the positive consequences?

3:38:24.840 --> 3:38:26.920
 Yeah, it's a fascinating world.

3:38:26.920 --> 3:38:28.240
 It's a really fascinating world.

3:38:28.240 --> 3:38:29.720
 Yeah, and then, but those conversations

3:38:29.720 --> 3:38:32.200
 are just so essential.

3:38:32.200 --> 3:38:34.280
 Like we have to be talking about ethics.

3:38:34.280 --> 3:38:37.400
 And then that raises the question of who is the we?

3:38:37.400 --> 3:38:39.800
 And coming back to your conversation

3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:41.960
 about science communication,

3:38:41.960 --> 3:38:44.120
 maybe there was a time earlier

3:38:44.120 --> 3:38:46.440
 when these conversations needed to be,

3:38:46.440 --> 3:38:49.360
 were held among a small number of experts

3:38:49.360 --> 3:38:53.120
 who made decisions on behalf of everybody else.

3:38:53.120 --> 3:38:54.800
 But what we're talking about here

3:38:54.800 --> 3:38:57.080
 is really the future of our species.

3:38:57.080 --> 3:39:01.120
 And I think that conversation is too important

3:39:01.120 --> 3:39:04.960
 to be left just to experts and government officials.

3:39:04.960 --> 3:39:06.840
 So I mentioned that I'm a member,

3:39:06.840 --> 3:39:09.040
 we just ended our work after two years

3:39:09.040 --> 3:39:11.560
 of the World Health Organization Expert Advisory Committee

3:39:11.560 --> 3:39:13.200
 on Human Genome Editing.

3:39:13.200 --> 3:39:16.440
 And my big push in that process

3:39:16.440 --> 3:39:21.080
 was to have education, engagement and empowerment

3:39:21.080 --> 3:39:23.040
 of the broad public to bring,

3:39:23.040 --> 3:39:25.920
 not just bring people into the conversation

3:39:25.920 --> 3:39:29.240
 with the tools to be able to engage,

3:39:29.240 --> 3:39:31.880
 but also into the decision making process.

3:39:31.880 --> 3:39:33.680
 And that's, it's a real shift.

3:39:33.680 --> 3:39:35.920
 And there are countries that are doing it

3:39:35.920 --> 3:39:37.120
 better than others.

3:39:37.120 --> 3:39:39.560
 I mean, Denmark is obviously a much smaller country

3:39:39.560 --> 3:39:40.800
 than the United States,

3:39:40.800 --> 3:39:44.320
 but they have a really well developed infrastructure

3:39:44.320 --> 3:39:46.360
 for public engagement

3:39:46.360 --> 3:39:49.040
 around really complicated scientific issues.

3:39:49.040 --> 3:39:50.960
 And I just think that we have to,

3:39:50.960 --> 3:39:53.400
 like it's great that we have Twitter

3:39:53.400 --> 3:39:55.120
 and all these other things,

3:39:55.120 --> 3:39:58.440
 but we need structured conversations

3:39:58.440 --> 3:40:00.480
 where we can really bring people together

3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:02.360
 and listen to each other,

3:40:02.360 --> 3:40:05.200
 which feels like it's harder than ever.

3:40:06.360 --> 3:40:08.360
 But even now in this process

3:40:08.360 --> 3:40:11.320
 where all these people are shouting at each other,

3:40:11.320 --> 3:40:12.800
 at least there are a bunch of people

3:40:12.800 --> 3:40:14.520
 who are in the conversation.

3:40:14.520 --> 3:40:16.520
 So it's, we have a foundation,

3:40:16.520 --> 3:40:20.400
 but we just really need to do more work.

3:40:20.400 --> 3:40:21.760
 And again, and again, and again,

3:40:21.760 --> 3:40:24.880
 it's about ethics and values

3:40:24.880 --> 3:40:27.200
 because we're at an age,

3:40:27.200 --> 3:40:28.760
 and this has become a cliche

3:40:28.760 --> 3:40:31.360
 of exponential technological change.

3:40:31.360 --> 3:40:35.440
 And so the rate of change is faster going forward

3:40:35.440 --> 3:40:36.640
 than it has been in the past.

3:40:36.640 --> 3:40:39.000
 So in our minds, we underappreciate

3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:43.520
 how quickly things are changing and will change.

3:40:43.520 --> 3:40:44.600
 And if we're not careful,

3:40:44.600 --> 3:40:48.640
 if we don't know who we are and what our values are,

3:40:48.640 --> 3:40:49.760
 we're going to get lost.

3:40:49.760 --> 3:40:52.240
 And we don't have to know technology.

3:40:52.240 --> 3:40:53.720
 We have to know who we are.

3:40:53.720 --> 3:40:58.720
 I mean, our values are hard won over thousands of years.

3:40:58.880 --> 3:41:01.040
 No matter how new the technology is,

3:41:01.040 --> 3:41:04.440
 we shouldn't and can't jettison our values

3:41:04.440 --> 3:41:08.360
 because that is our primary navigational tool.

3:41:08.360 --> 3:41:09.760
 Absurd question.

3:41:09.760 --> 3:41:14.760
 Because we were saying that sexual reproduction

3:41:15.440 --> 3:41:17.800
 is not the best way to define the offspring.

3:41:17.800 --> 3:41:21.440
 You think there'll be a day when humans stop having sex?

3:41:21.440 --> 3:41:23.240
 I don't think we'll stop having sex

3:41:23.240 --> 3:41:25.520
 because it's so enjoyable,

3:41:26.400 --> 3:41:30.880
 but we may significantly stop having sex for reproduction.

3:41:30.880 --> 3:41:35.080
 Even today, most human sex is not for making babies.

3:41:35.080 --> 3:41:36.200
 It's for other things,

3:41:36.200 --> 3:41:40.800
 whether it's pleasure or love or pair bonding or whatever.

3:41:40.800 --> 3:41:41.640
 Intimacy.

3:41:41.640 --> 3:41:42.480
 Intimacy.

3:41:42.480 --> 3:41:44.440
 I mean, some people do it for intimacy.

3:41:44.440 --> 3:41:46.960
 Some people do it for pleasure with strangers.

3:41:46.960 --> 3:41:48.880
 I feel like the people that do it for pleasure,

3:41:48.880 --> 3:41:50.920
 I feel like there will be better ways

3:41:50.920 --> 3:41:54.640
 to achieve that same chemical pleasure, right?

3:41:54.640 --> 3:41:57.560
 You know, there's just so many different kinds of people.

3:41:57.560 --> 3:42:00.040
 I just saw this on television,

3:42:00.040 --> 3:42:02.640
 but there are people who put on those big bunny outfits

3:42:02.640 --> 3:42:04.320
 and go and have sex with other people.

3:42:04.320 --> 3:42:06.640
 I mean, there's just like an unlimited number

3:42:06.640 --> 3:42:07.960
 of different kinds of people.

3:42:07.960 --> 3:42:09.480
 I think they're called,

3:42:09.480 --> 3:42:10.960
 so I remember hearing about this,

3:42:10.960 --> 3:42:14.080
 I think Dan Savage is a podcast.

3:42:14.080 --> 3:42:16.680
 I think they're called Furries.

3:42:16.680 --> 3:42:17.520
 Furries.

3:42:17.520 --> 3:42:18.360
 Furries.

3:42:18.360 --> 3:42:19.200
 Furry parties.

3:42:19.200 --> 3:42:20.040
 Yeah, exactly.

3:42:20.040 --> 3:42:20.880
 So they're just...

3:42:20.880 --> 3:42:21.720
 I love people.

3:42:21.720 --> 3:42:24.440
 Yeah, well, that's like the thing.

3:42:24.440 --> 3:42:25.760
 It's like, whenever you hear these words,

3:42:25.760 --> 3:42:27.320
 it's like, humans.

3:42:27.320 --> 3:42:28.160
 Yeah, yeah.

3:42:28.160 --> 3:42:30.000
 What will they think of next?

3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:31.160
 So, but I do think that,

3:42:31.160 --> 3:42:33.760
 and I write about this in Hacking Darwin,

3:42:33.760 --> 3:42:38.760
 that as people come to believe that having,

3:42:39.680 --> 3:42:43.000
 that making children through the application of science

3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:46.080
 is safer and more beneficial

3:42:46.080 --> 3:42:48.760
 than having children through sex,

3:42:48.760 --> 3:42:52.120
 we'll start to see a shift over time

3:42:52.120 --> 3:42:54.400
 toward reproduction through science.

3:42:54.400 --> 3:42:58.760
 We'll still have sex for all the same great reasons

3:42:58.760 --> 3:43:00.400
 that we do it now,

3:43:00.400 --> 3:43:03.360
 it's just reproduction less and less through the act of sex.

3:43:04.720 --> 3:43:07.040
 Man, it's such a fascinating future.

3:43:08.360 --> 3:43:11.160
 Because as somebody, I value flaws.

3:43:11.160 --> 3:43:16.160
 I think it's the good will hunting,

3:43:17.120 --> 3:43:18.520
 that's the good stuff.

3:43:18.520 --> 3:43:21.880
 The flaws, the weird quirks of humans,

3:43:21.880 --> 3:43:25.360
 that's what makes us who we are, the weird.

3:43:25.360 --> 3:43:26.640
 The weird is the beautiful.

3:43:26.640 --> 3:43:31.640
 And I, there's a fear of optimization that I...

3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:33.840
 You should have it.

3:43:33.840 --> 3:43:35.440
 I mean, it's very healthy.

3:43:35.440 --> 3:43:36.800
 And I think that's, I was saying before,

3:43:36.800 --> 3:43:39.880
 that's the danger of all of this selection

3:43:39.880 --> 3:43:44.320
 is that we make selections just based on social norms

3:43:44.320 --> 3:43:47.440
 that are so deeply internal

3:43:47.440 --> 3:43:51.120
 that they feel like they're eternal truths.

3:43:51.120 --> 3:43:54.520
 And so we talked about selecting for IQ.

3:43:54.520 --> 3:43:56.760
 What about selecting for a kind heart?

3:43:56.760 --> 3:43:57.760
 Like there are lots of them.

3:43:57.760 --> 3:43:59.480
 You talked about Hitler and Mein Kampf.

3:43:59.480 --> 3:44:03.040
 Hitler had certainly had a high IQ,

3:44:03.040 --> 3:44:05.040
 I guess is higher than average IQ.

3:44:06.120 --> 3:44:07.920
 If we just select,

3:44:07.920 --> 3:44:11.000
 I mean, that's why I was saying before,

3:44:11.000 --> 3:44:13.440
 diversity is baked into our biology.

3:44:13.440 --> 3:44:16.080
 But the key lesson, and I've said this many times before,

3:44:16.080 --> 3:44:18.960
 the key lesson of this moment in our history

3:44:18.960 --> 3:44:22.680
 is that after nearly 4 billion years of evolution,

3:44:22.680 --> 3:44:26.280
 our one species suddenly has the unique

3:44:26.280 --> 3:44:28.040
 and increasing ability to read, write,

3:44:28.040 --> 3:44:30.200
 and hack the code of life.

3:44:30.200 --> 3:44:34.080
 And so as we apply these godlike powers

3:44:34.080 --> 3:44:37.960
 that we've now assumed for ourselves,

3:44:37.960 --> 3:44:39.840
 we better be pretty careful

3:44:39.840 --> 3:44:44.120
 because it's so easy to make mistakes,

3:44:44.120 --> 3:44:47.080
 particularly mistakes that are guided

3:44:47.080 --> 3:44:48.480
 by our best intentions.

3:44:49.640 --> 3:44:52.160
 To jump briefly back onto lab leak,

3:44:52.160 --> 3:44:54.160
 and I swear there's a reason for that,

3:44:55.680 --> 3:44:58.200
 what did you think about the Jon Stewart,

3:44:59.200 --> 3:45:02.440
 this moment, I forget when it was, maybe a few months ago,

3:45:02.440 --> 3:45:05.200
 in the summer, I think, of 2021,

3:45:05.200 --> 3:45:07.880
 where he went on Colbert Report,

3:45:07.880 --> 3:45:09.320
 or not the Colbert Report, sorry,

3:45:09.320 --> 3:45:13.320
 the Stephen Colbert's, whatever his show is.

3:45:13.320 --> 3:45:15.680
 But again, Jon Stewart reminded us

3:45:15.680 --> 3:45:18.840
 how valuable his wit and brilliance

3:45:18.840 --> 3:45:22.200
 within the humor was for our culture.

3:45:22.200 --> 3:45:24.480
 And so he did this whole bit

3:45:24.480 --> 3:45:27.440
 that highlighted the common sense nature

3:45:27.440 --> 3:45:30.000
 about what was the metaphor he used

3:45:30.000 --> 3:45:33.080
 about the Hershey factory in Pennsylvania.

3:45:33.080 --> 3:45:34.800
 So what'd you think about that whole bit?

3:45:34.800 --> 3:45:36.520
 I loved it.

3:45:36.520 --> 3:45:40.920
 And so not to be overly self referential,

3:45:40.920 --> 3:45:43.160
 but it's hard not to be overly self referential

3:45:43.160 --> 3:45:45.000
 when you're doing a, however long we are,

3:45:45.000 --> 3:45:47.560
 five hour interview about yourself,

3:45:47.560 --> 3:45:50.600
 which it reminds me of when you had Bret Weinstein on,

3:45:50.600 --> 3:45:52.520
 he said, I have no ego,

3:45:52.520 --> 3:45:55.000
 but these 57 people have screwed me over,

3:45:55.000 --> 3:45:56.760
 and I deserve credit.

3:45:56.760 --> 3:45:57.600
 It's hard.

3:45:57.600 --> 3:46:02.600
 So I am a person, I will confess, it's enjoyable.

3:46:02.640 --> 3:46:03.480
 Some people feel different.

3:46:03.480 --> 3:46:06.120
 I kind of like talking about all this stuff

3:46:06.120 --> 3:46:07.880
 and talking, period.

3:46:08.920 --> 3:46:10.480
 So for me, in the earliest,

3:46:10.480 --> 3:46:13.720
 I remember those early days of when the pandemic started,

3:46:13.720 --> 3:46:14.720
 I was just sitting down,

3:46:14.720 --> 3:46:17.120
 it was late January, early February, 2020,

3:46:17.120 --> 3:46:20.040
 and I just was laying out all of the evidence

3:46:20.040 --> 3:46:22.320
 just that I could collect,

3:46:22.320 --> 3:46:26.240
 trying to say, make sense of where does this come from?

3:46:26.240 --> 3:46:28.880
 And it was just logic.

3:46:28.880 --> 3:46:32.920
 I mean, it was all of the things that Jon Stewart said,

3:46:32.920 --> 3:46:36.200
 which in some overly wordy form

3:46:36.200 --> 3:46:38.440
 were all at that time on my website.

3:46:38.440 --> 3:46:42.640
 Like, what are the odds of having this outbreak

3:46:42.640 --> 3:46:45.720
 of a bat coronavirus more than a thousand miles away

3:46:45.720 --> 3:46:48.960
 from where these bats have their natural habitat,

3:46:48.960 --> 3:46:52.320
 where they have this largest collection

3:46:52.320 --> 3:46:54.920
 of these bat coronaviruses in the world,

3:46:54.920 --> 3:46:57.040
 and they're doing all these very aggressive

3:46:58.280 --> 3:47:01.920
 research projects to make them more aggressive.

3:47:01.920 --> 3:47:04.080
 And then you have the outbreak of a virus

3:47:04.080 --> 3:47:07.680
 that's primed for human to human transmission.

3:47:09.400 --> 3:47:12.360
 It was just logic was my first step.

3:47:12.360 --> 3:47:17.320
 And I kept gathering the information.

3:47:17.320 --> 3:47:19.880
 But Jon Stewart distilled that

3:47:19.880 --> 3:47:23.120
 in a way that just everybody got.

3:47:23.120 --> 3:47:26.120
 And I think that, like, I loved it.

3:47:26.120 --> 3:47:28.800
 And I just think that there's a way of reaching people.

3:47:28.800 --> 3:47:31.280
 It's the reason why I write science fiction

3:47:31.280 --> 3:47:34.000
 in addition to thinking and writing about the science

3:47:34.000 --> 3:47:37.440
 is that we kind of have to reach people where they are.

3:47:37.440 --> 3:47:40.160
 And I just thought it was just,

3:47:40.160 --> 3:47:42.480
 there was a lot of depth, I thought,

3:47:42.480 --> 3:47:46.400
 and maybe that's too self serving,

3:47:46.400 --> 3:47:48.560
 but like in the analysis,

3:47:48.560 --> 3:47:53.560
 but he captured that into those things about,

3:47:54.080 --> 3:47:58.760
 it's like the, whatever, the outbreak of chewy goodness

3:47:58.760 --> 3:48:00.240
 near the Hershey factory.

3:48:00.240 --> 3:48:01.720
 I wonder where that came from.

3:48:01.720 --> 3:48:05.000
 Yeah, there's the humor, there's metaphor.

3:48:05.000 --> 3:48:07.760
 Also the, like, sticking with the joke

3:48:07.760 --> 3:48:09.120
 when the audience is,

3:48:12.000 --> 3:48:13.800
 the audience is Stephen Colbert.

3:48:13.800 --> 3:48:16.120
 He was, like, resisting it.

3:48:16.120 --> 3:48:17.600
 He was very uncomfortable with it.

3:48:17.600 --> 3:48:19.960
 Maybe that was part of the bit, I'm not sure,

3:48:19.960 --> 3:48:21.760
 but it didn't look like it.

3:48:21.760 --> 3:48:24.000
 So Stephen in that moment kind of represented

3:48:24.000 --> 3:48:26.560
 the discomfort of the scientific community, I think.

3:48:26.560 --> 3:48:28.640
 It's kind of interesting, that whole dynamic.

3:48:28.640 --> 3:48:31.320
 And I think that was a pivotal moment.

3:48:32.880 --> 3:48:35.560
 That just, like, highlights the value of comedy,

3:48:35.560 --> 3:48:39.920
 the value of, like, when Joe Rogan says,

3:48:39.920 --> 3:48:41.320
 I'm just a comedian.

3:48:42.360 --> 3:48:46.000
 I mean, that's such a funny thing to say.

3:48:46.000 --> 3:48:48.120
 It's like saying I'm just a podcaster

3:48:48.120 --> 3:48:51.760
 or I'm just a writer, I'm just a, you know.

3:48:51.760 --> 3:48:55.920
 That ability in so few words

3:48:55.920 --> 3:48:59.200
 to express what everybody else is thinking,

3:49:00.560 --> 3:49:02.520
 it's so refreshing.

3:49:02.520 --> 3:49:06.320
 And I wish the scientific communicators would do that too.

3:49:06.320 --> 3:49:08.280
 A little humor, a little humor.

3:49:08.280 --> 3:49:10.560
 I mean, that's what I love Elon Musk very much.

3:49:10.560 --> 3:49:13.360
 So, like, the way he communicates is, like,

3:49:13.360 --> 3:49:18.360
 it's so refreshing for a CEO of a major company,

3:49:18.960 --> 3:49:22.520
 several major companies, to just have a sense of humor

3:49:22.520 --> 3:49:24.840
 and say ridiculous shit every once in a while.

3:49:24.840 --> 3:49:26.960
 That's so, there's something to that.

3:49:26.960 --> 3:49:29.560
 Like, it shakes up the whole conversation

3:49:29.560 --> 3:49:33.760
 to where it gives you freedom to, like, think publicly.

3:49:33.760 --> 3:49:36.920
 If you're always trying to say the proper thing,

3:49:36.920 --> 3:49:40.240
 you lose the freedom to think, to reason out,

3:49:40.240 --> 3:49:42.720
 to be authentic and genuine.

3:49:42.720 --> 3:49:44.960
 When you allow yourself the freedom

3:49:44.960 --> 3:49:48.000
 to regularly say stupid shit,

3:49:48.000 --> 3:49:51.680
 have fun, make fun of yourself,

3:49:51.680 --> 3:49:53.120
 I think you give yourself freedom

3:49:53.120 --> 3:49:55.760
 to really be a great scientist.

3:49:55.760 --> 3:49:58.960
 Honestly, I think scientists have a lot to learn

3:49:58.960 --> 3:50:00.080
 from comedians.

3:50:00.080 --> 3:50:00.920
 Well, for sure.

3:50:00.920 --> 3:50:05.360
 I think we all do about just distilling and communicating

3:50:05.360 --> 3:50:07.280
 in ways that people can hear.

3:50:07.280 --> 3:50:10.440
 Like, a lot of us say things and people just can't hear them

3:50:10.440 --> 3:50:12.040
 either because of the way we're saying them

3:50:12.040 --> 3:50:14.440
 or where they are, but.

3:50:14.440 --> 3:50:19.360
 And like I said before, I'm a big fan of Joe Rogan.

3:50:19.360 --> 3:50:20.880
 I've been on his show twice.

3:50:20.880 --> 3:50:25.400
 And when Francis Collins was in his conversation with you,

3:50:25.400 --> 3:50:27.840
 he said, which I think makes sense,

3:50:27.840 --> 3:50:31.000
 is that when somebody has that kind of platform

3:50:31.000 --> 3:50:34.040
 and people rightly or wrongly who follow them

3:50:34.040 --> 3:50:36.960
 and look to them for guidance,

3:50:36.960 --> 3:50:40.760
 I do think that there is some responsibility

3:50:40.760 --> 3:50:45.000
 for people in those roles to make whatever judgment

3:50:45.000 --> 3:50:47.200
 that they make and to share that.

3:50:47.200 --> 3:50:50.640
 And as I mentioned to you when we were off mic,

3:50:50.640 --> 3:50:53.200
 Sanjay Gupta is a very close friend of mine.

3:50:53.200 --> 3:50:54.840
 We've been friends for many years

3:50:54.840 --> 3:50:58.400
 and I fully supported Sanjay's instinct

3:50:58.400 --> 3:51:02.160
 to go on the Joe Rogan show.

3:51:02.160 --> 3:51:05.200
 I thought it was great.

3:51:05.200 --> 3:51:09.280
 At the end of that whole conversation, Joe said,

3:51:09.280 --> 3:51:12.240
 well, I'm just a comedian, what do I know?

3:51:12.240 --> 3:51:16.440
 And I just felt that, yes, Joe Rogan is a comedian.

3:51:16.440 --> 3:51:20.440
 I wouldn't say just a comedian among other things.

3:51:20.440 --> 3:51:23.720
 But I also felt that he had a responsibility

3:51:23.720 --> 3:51:25.280
 for just saying whatever he believed,

3:51:25.280 --> 3:51:30.040
 even if he believed or believes as I think is the case

3:51:30.040 --> 3:51:32.960
 that ivermectin should be studied more,

3:51:32.960 --> 3:51:34.880
 which I certainly agree.

3:51:34.880 --> 3:51:39.880
 And that healthy people shouldn't get vaccinated,

3:51:40.080 --> 3:51:42.560
 healthy young people, which I don't agree.

3:51:42.560 --> 3:51:44.840
 I just felt at the end of that conversation to say,

3:51:44.840 --> 3:51:47.520
 well, I'm just a comedian, what do I know?

3:51:47.520 --> 3:51:51.960
 I feel like it didn't fully integrate the power

3:51:51.960 --> 3:51:55.200
 that a person like Joe Rogan has to set the agenda.

3:51:55.200 --> 3:51:58.360
 So I think the reason he says I'm just a comedian

3:51:58.360 --> 3:52:00.480
 is the same reason I say I'm an idiot,

3:52:00.480 --> 3:52:02.080
 which I truly believe.

3:52:02.080 --> 3:52:03.800
 I can explain exactly what I mean by that,

3:52:03.800 --> 3:52:08.800
 but it's more for him, or in this case for me,

3:52:09.680 --> 3:52:11.080
 to just keep yourself humble.

3:52:11.080 --> 3:52:14.720
 Because I think it's a slippery slope

3:52:14.720 --> 3:52:16.440
 when you think you have a responsibility

3:52:16.440 --> 3:52:19.680
 to then think you actually have an authority,

3:52:21.000 --> 3:52:22.720
 because a lot of people listen to you,

3:52:22.720 --> 3:52:24.000
 you think you have an authority

3:52:24.000 --> 3:52:26.560
 to actually speak to those people

3:52:26.560 --> 3:52:27.840
 and you have enough authority

3:52:27.840 --> 3:52:29.840
 to know what the hell you're talking about.

3:52:29.840 --> 3:52:31.840
 And I think there's just the humility

3:52:31.840 --> 3:52:34.040
 to just kind of make it fun of yourself

3:52:34.040 --> 3:52:35.800
 that's extremely valuable.

3:52:35.800 --> 3:52:40.200
 And saying I'm just a comedian I think is a reminder

3:52:40.200 --> 3:52:45.200
 to himself that he's often full of shit, so are all of us.

3:52:48.000 --> 3:52:51.200
 And so that's a really powerful way for himself

3:52:51.200 --> 3:52:52.400
 to keep himself humble.

3:52:53.560 --> 3:52:55.600
 I mean, I think that's really useful

3:52:55.600 --> 3:52:57.880
 in some kind of way for people in general

3:52:57.880 --> 3:53:00.720
 to make fun of themselves a little bit,

3:53:00.720 --> 3:53:02.120
 in whatever way that means.

3:53:02.120 --> 3:53:04.960
 And saying I'm just a comedian is just one way to do that.

3:53:04.960 --> 3:53:07.360
 Now that coupled that with the responsibility

3:53:07.360 --> 3:53:10.960
 of doing the research and really having an open mind

3:53:10.960 --> 3:53:12.200
 and all those kinds of stuff,

3:53:12.200 --> 3:53:15.360
 I think that's something Joe does really well

3:53:15.360 --> 3:53:18.320
 on a lot of topics, but he can't do that on everything.

3:53:18.320 --> 3:53:22.240
 And so it's up to people to decide

3:53:22.240 --> 3:53:26.400
 how well he does it on certain topics and not others.

3:53:26.400 --> 3:53:29.120
 But how do you think Sanjay did in that conversation?

3:53:29.120 --> 3:53:31.960
 So I know I'm gonna get myself into trouble here

3:53:31.960 --> 3:53:35.240
 because Sanjay is a very close friend.

3:53:35.240 --> 3:53:38.080
 Joe, my personal interaction with him

3:53:38.080 --> 3:53:39.520
 has been our two interviews,

3:53:39.520 --> 3:53:41.000
 but it's like my interview with now,

3:53:41.000 --> 3:53:43.120
 sit down with somebody for four hours,

3:53:43.120 --> 3:53:48.120
 it's a lot and great and then private communication.

3:53:48.800 --> 3:53:53.800
 So I am personally more sympathetic to the arguments

3:53:53.880 --> 3:53:58.080
 that Sanjay was making or trying to make.

3:53:58.080 --> 3:54:01.000
 I believe that the threat of the virus

3:54:01.000 --> 3:54:03.920
 is greater than the threat of the vaccine.

3:54:03.920 --> 3:54:08.560
 That doesn't mean that we can guarantee 100% safety

3:54:08.560 --> 3:54:09.520
 for the vaccine,

3:54:09.520 --> 3:54:13.360
 but these are really well tolerated vaccines.

3:54:13.360 --> 3:54:15.320
 And we know for all the reasons we've been talking about

3:54:15.320 --> 3:54:18.120
 that this is a really scary virus

3:54:18.120 --> 3:54:20.560
 and particularly the mRNA vaccines,

3:54:20.560 --> 3:54:23.040
 what they're basically doing is getting your body

3:54:23.040 --> 3:54:25.800
 to replicate a tiny little piece of the virus,

3:54:25.800 --> 3:54:29.720
 the spike protein and then your body responds to that.

3:54:29.720 --> 3:54:34.560
 And so that's a much less of an insult to your body

3:54:34.560 --> 3:54:37.040
 than being infected by the virus.

3:54:37.040 --> 3:54:41.080
 So I'm more sympathetic to the people who say,

3:54:41.080 --> 3:54:44.720
 well, everybody should get vaccinated,

3:54:44.720 --> 3:54:47.680
 but people who've already been infected,

3:54:47.680 --> 3:54:52.560
 we should study whether they need to be vaccinated or not.

3:54:52.560 --> 3:54:55.920
 Having said all of that, I felt that

3:54:57.320 --> 3:54:59.600
 that Joe Rogan won the debate.

3:54:59.600 --> 3:55:02.240
 I mean, it was, and the reason that I felt

3:55:02.240 --> 3:55:05.760
 that he won the debate was they were kind of,

3:55:05.760 --> 3:55:08.240
 they had two different categories of arguments.

3:55:08.240 --> 3:55:11.520
 So Sanjay, what he was trying to do,

3:55:11.520 --> 3:55:13.240
 which I totally respect was saying,

3:55:13.240 --> 3:55:15.600
 there's so much animosity between the,

3:55:15.600 --> 3:55:17.640
 on these different sides, let's lower the temperature.

3:55:17.640 --> 3:55:22.560
 Let's model that we can have a respectful dialogue

3:55:22.560 --> 3:55:24.640
 with each other where we can actually listen.

3:55:24.640 --> 3:55:27.120
 And Sanjay, again, I've known him for many years.

3:55:27.120 --> 3:55:30.400
 He's a very empathic, humble,

3:55:30.400 --> 3:55:33.680
 just an all around wonderful human being,

3:55:33.680 --> 3:55:35.760
 and I really love him.

3:55:35.760 --> 3:55:38.400
 And so he was making cases that were based on

3:55:38.400 --> 3:55:41.160
 kind of averages, studies and things like that.

3:55:41.160 --> 3:55:45.720
 And Joe was saying, well, I know a guy whose sister's cousin

3:55:45.720 --> 3:55:48.080
 had this experience.

3:55:48.080 --> 3:55:51.000
 And I'm sure that it's all true in the sense

3:55:51.000 --> 3:55:54.280
 that we have millions of people who are getting vaccinated

3:55:54.280 --> 3:55:56.200
 and different things.

3:55:56.200 --> 3:55:59.120
 And what Sanjay should have said was,

3:55:59.120 --> 3:56:01.360
 I know that's anecdote.

3:56:01.360 --> 3:56:04.440
 Here's another anecdote of like when Francis Collins

3:56:04.440 --> 3:56:07.840
 was with you and he talked about the world wrestling guy

3:56:07.840 --> 3:56:10.280
 who was like 6.6 and a big muscly guy,

3:56:10.280 --> 3:56:12.840
 and then he got COVID and he was anti vaccine,

3:56:12.840 --> 3:56:14.400
 and then he got COVID and almost died.

3:56:14.400 --> 3:56:15.240
 And he said, I'm gonna.

3:56:15.240 --> 3:56:17.920
 By the way, I don't know if you know this part.

3:56:17.920 --> 3:56:18.760
 No.

3:56:18.760 --> 3:56:19.580
 Oh, this is funny.

3:56:19.580 --> 3:56:20.680
 Joe's gonna listen to this.

3:56:20.680 --> 3:56:21.960
 He's gonna be laughing.

3:56:21.960 --> 3:56:24.640
 Does Joe listen like to the four hours of this

3:56:24.640 --> 3:56:28.320
 in addition to the three hours of his interviews every day?

3:56:28.320 --> 3:56:30.800
 No, not every day, but he listens to a lot of these.

3:56:30.800 --> 3:56:31.640
 I love it.

3:56:31.640 --> 3:56:32.460
 And we talk about it.

3:56:32.460 --> 3:56:33.300
 I love it.

3:56:33.300 --> 3:56:34.140
 We argue about it.

3:56:34.140 --> 3:56:34.960
 Hi, Joe.

3:56:34.960 --> 3:56:35.800
 Hey, Joe.

3:56:35.800 --> 3:56:36.640
 We love you, Joe.

3:56:37.560 --> 3:56:40.240
 So that particular case,

3:56:40.240 --> 3:56:43.220
 I don't know why Francis said what he said there,

3:56:43.220 --> 3:56:45.100
 but that's not accurate.

3:56:45.100 --> 3:56:45.960
 Oh, really?

3:56:45.960 --> 3:56:50.800
 So the wrestler never, he didn't almost die.

3:56:50.800 --> 3:56:53.120
 He was no big deal at all for him.

3:56:53.120 --> 3:56:54.480
 And he said that to him.

3:56:54.480 --> 3:56:56.880
 I think, I'm not sure.

3:56:56.880 --> 3:57:00.200
 I think something got mixed up in Francis's memory.

3:57:00.200 --> 3:57:02.320
 There was another case he must've been like,

3:57:02.320 --> 3:57:05.360
 cause I don't imagine he would bring that case up

3:57:05.360 --> 3:57:09.400
 and just like make it up, you know, cause like why?

3:57:09.400 --> 3:57:11.540
 But he, that was not at all,

3:57:11.540 --> 3:57:13.160
 like that was a pretty public case.

3:57:13.160 --> 3:57:16.480
 He had an interview with him, that wrestler,

3:57:16.480 --> 3:57:17.480
 he was just fine.

3:57:17.480 --> 3:57:19.760
 So that anecdotal case, I mean,

3:57:19.760 --> 3:57:21.040
 Francis should not have done that.

3:57:21.040 --> 3:57:24.320
 So if I have any, so I have a bunch of criticism

3:57:24.320 --> 3:57:26.200
 of how that went.

3:57:26.200 --> 3:57:28.680
 People who criticize that interview,

3:57:28.680 --> 3:57:32.320
 I feel like don't give enough respect

3:57:32.320 --> 3:57:33.840
 to the full range of things

3:57:33.840 --> 3:57:35.760
 that Francis Collins has done in his career.

3:57:35.760 --> 3:57:37.400
 He's an incredible scientist.

3:57:37.400 --> 3:57:40.120
 And I also think a really good human being.

3:57:40.120 --> 3:57:44.640
 But yes, that conversation was flawed in many ways.

3:57:44.640 --> 3:57:47.840
 And one of them was why,

3:57:47.840 --> 3:57:52.000
 when you're trying to present some kind of critical,

3:57:53.800 --> 3:57:56.480
 like criticize Joe Rogan,

3:57:56.480 --> 3:57:58.720
 why bring up anecdotal evidence at all?

3:57:58.720 --> 3:58:01.200
 And if you do bring up anecdotal evidence,

3:58:02.040 --> 3:58:04.040
 which is not scientific, if you're a scientist,

3:58:04.040 --> 3:58:06.160
 you should not be using anecdotal evidence.

3:58:06.160 --> 3:58:07.980
 If you do bring it up,

3:58:07.980 --> 3:58:12.400
 why bring up one that's first not true

3:58:12.400 --> 3:58:13.760
 and you know it's not true?

3:58:15.400 --> 3:58:18.600
 So I know, pretend, so you don't know it's not true.

3:58:18.600 --> 3:58:23.200
 So yes, that would find another case where, exactly.

3:58:23.200 --> 3:58:24.840
 So the basic thing coming back

3:58:24.840 --> 3:58:28.080
 to Sanjay and Joe's conversation

3:58:28.080 --> 3:58:31.620
 was that Sanjay was trying to use statistical evidence

3:58:31.620 --> 3:58:33.600
 and Joe was using anecdotal evidence.

3:58:33.600 --> 3:58:36.040
 And so I think that for Sanjay,

3:58:36.040 --> 3:58:39.320
 and there are all kinds of things where there are debates

3:58:39.320 --> 3:58:42.800
 where often the person who's better at debating

3:58:42.800 --> 3:58:46.960
 wins the debate regardless of the topic.

3:58:46.960 --> 3:58:49.560
 So I think what Sanjay could have done,

3:58:49.560 --> 3:58:53.000
 and Sanjay is such a smart guy,

3:58:53.000 --> 3:58:55.920
 is to say, well, that's an anecdote,

3:58:55.920 --> 3:58:57.520
 here's another anecdote.

3:58:57.520 --> 3:59:00.040
 And there are lots of different anecdotes.

3:59:00.040 --> 3:59:03.680
 And there certainly are people who have taken the vaccine

3:59:03.680 --> 3:59:07.120
 and have had problems that could reasonably be traced

3:59:07.120 --> 3:59:08.280
 to the vaccines.

3:59:08.280 --> 3:59:11.200
 And there certainly are lots of people, I would argue,

3:59:11.200 --> 3:59:14.180
 more people who've not had the vaccine,

3:59:14.180 --> 3:59:16.400
 but who've gotten COVID and have either died

3:59:16.400 --> 3:59:19.200
 or our hospitals are now full of people

3:59:19.200 --> 3:59:20.440
 who weren't vaccinated.

3:59:20.440 --> 3:59:23.040
 And in many ways, I mean, our emergency rooms

3:59:23.040 --> 3:59:26.220
 are full of unvaccinated people here in the United States.

3:59:26.220 --> 3:59:28.720
 So I think what Sanjay could have done,

3:59:28.720 --> 3:59:32.920
 but there was a conflict between wanting to kind of

3:59:32.920 --> 3:59:36.840
 win the debate and wanting to take the temperature down.

3:59:36.840 --> 3:59:39.500
 And what he could have done is to say,

3:59:39.500 --> 3:59:42.280
 well, here's an anecdote, I have a counter anecdote

3:59:42.280 --> 3:59:43.680
 and we can go on all day,

3:59:43.680 --> 3:59:46.320
 but here's what the statistics show.

3:59:46.320 --> 3:59:48.480
 And I think that was the thing.

3:59:48.480 --> 3:59:50.360
 So I think it's a healthy conversation.

3:59:50.360 --> 3:59:52.640
 We can't, I mean, there are a lot of people

3:59:52.640 --> 3:59:55.240
 who are afraid of the vaccine.

3:59:55.240 --> 3:59:56.680
 There are a lot of people who don't trust

3:59:56.680 --> 3:59:58.280
 the scientific establishment

3:59:58.280 --> 4:00:00.000
 and lots of them have good reason.

4:00:00.000 --> 4:00:04.520
 I mean, it's not just people think of like Trump Republicans.

4:00:04.520 --> 4:00:08.600
 There are lots of people in the African American community

4:00:08.600 --> 4:00:11.920
 who've had a historical terrible experience

4:00:11.920 --> 4:00:14.400
 with the Tuskegee and all sorts of things.

4:00:14.400 --> 4:00:16.920
 So they don't trust the messages

4:00:16.920 --> 4:00:18.120
 that were being delivered.

4:00:18.120 --> 4:00:21.440
 I live in New York City and we had a piece

4:00:21.440 --> 4:00:23.840
 in the New York Times where in the earliest days

4:00:23.840 --> 4:00:25.920
 of the vaccines, there was this big movement,

4:00:25.920 --> 4:00:28.960
 let's make sure that the poorest people in the city

4:00:28.960 --> 4:00:31.920
 have first access to the vaccines

4:00:31.920 --> 4:00:35.200
 because they're the ones, they have higher density

4:00:35.200 --> 4:00:37.920
 in their homes, they're relying on public transport.

4:00:37.920 --> 4:00:39.400
 So there was this whole liberal effort.

4:00:39.400 --> 4:00:42.440
 And then in the black community in New York,

4:00:42.440 --> 4:00:43.520
 according to the New York Times,

4:00:43.520 --> 4:00:46.320
 there was very low acceptance of the vaccines

4:00:46.320 --> 4:00:48.040
 and they interviewed people in that article.

4:00:48.040 --> 4:00:51.480
 And they said, well, if the white people want us

4:00:51.480 --> 4:00:54.640
 to have it first, there must be something wrong with it.

4:00:54.640 --> 4:00:56.720
 They must be doing something.

4:00:56.720 --> 4:00:59.840
 And so we have to listen to each other.

4:00:59.840 --> 4:01:04.720
 Like I would never, I have a disrespect for everybody.

4:01:04.720 --> 4:01:07.880
 And if somebody is cautious about the vaccine

4:01:07.880 --> 4:01:10.320
 for themselves or for their children,

4:01:10.320 --> 4:01:12.320
 we have to listen to them.

4:01:12.320 --> 4:01:15.960
 At the same time, public health

4:01:15.960 --> 4:01:19.160
 is about creating public health.

4:01:19.160 --> 4:01:23.160
 And there's no doubt, I think Joe was absolutely right

4:01:23.160 --> 4:01:28.160
 that older people, obese people are at greater risk

4:01:28.240 --> 4:01:32.840
 for being harmed or killed by COVID 19

4:01:32.840 --> 4:01:34.560
 than young, healthy people.

4:01:34.560 --> 4:01:38.160
 But by everybody getting vaccinated,

4:01:38.160 --> 4:01:41.240
 we reduce the risk to everybody else.

4:01:41.240 --> 4:01:43.720
 And so I feel like, like with everything,

4:01:43.720 --> 4:01:46.680
 there's the individual benefit argument

4:01:46.680 --> 4:01:49.360
 and then there's the community argument.

4:01:49.360 --> 4:01:50.480
 And I absolutely think our community.

4:01:50.480 --> 4:01:53.320
 Expressing that clearly that there's a difference between

4:01:53.320 --> 4:01:56.400
 the individual health and freedoms

4:01:56.400 --> 4:01:59.160
 and the community health and freedoms

4:01:59.160 --> 4:02:01.920
 and steel manning each side of this.

4:02:01.920 --> 4:02:05.160
 One of the problems that people don't do enough of

4:02:05.160 --> 4:02:08.720
 is be able to, so how do you steel man an argument?

4:02:08.720 --> 4:02:11.560
 You describe that argument in the best possible way.

4:02:12.640 --> 4:02:14.520
 You have to first understand that argument.

4:02:14.520 --> 4:02:17.880
 Let's go to the noncontroversial thing like Flat Earth.

4:02:17.880 --> 4:02:22.880
 Like most people, most colleagues of mine at MIT

4:02:23.800 --> 4:02:28.800
 don't even read about like the full argument

4:02:28.880 --> 4:02:31.080
 that the Flat Earthers make.

4:02:31.080 --> 4:02:36.080
 I feel it's disingenuous for people in the physics community

4:02:37.000 --> 4:02:39.640
 to roll their eyes at Flat Earthers

4:02:39.640 --> 4:02:42.200
 if they haven't read their arguments.

4:02:42.200 --> 4:02:46.120
 You should feel bad that you didn't read their arguments.

4:02:46.120 --> 4:02:50.680
 And like it's the rolling of the eyes that's a big problem.

4:02:50.680 --> 4:02:51.960
 You haven't read it.

4:02:51.960 --> 4:02:55.280
 Your intuition says that these are a bunch of crazy people.

4:02:55.280 --> 4:02:59.480
 Okay, but you haven't earned the right to roll your eyes.

4:02:59.480 --> 4:03:03.640
 You've earned your right to maybe not read it,

4:03:03.640 --> 4:03:05.000
 but then don't have an opinion.

4:03:05.000 --> 4:03:07.720
 Don't roll your eyes, don't do any of that dismissive stuff.

4:03:07.720 --> 4:03:11.200
 And the same thing in the scientific community

4:03:11.200 --> 4:03:14.360
 around COVID and so on, there's often this kind of saying,

4:03:14.360 --> 4:03:17.720
 oh God, that's conspiracy theories, that's misinformation

4:03:17.720 --> 4:03:20.320
 without actually looking into what they're saying.

4:03:20.320 --> 4:03:22.400
 If you haven't looked into what they're saying,

4:03:22.400 --> 4:03:23.880
 then don't talk about it.

4:03:23.880 --> 4:03:26.280
 Like if you're a scientific leader and the communicator,

4:03:26.280 --> 4:03:27.560
 you need to look into it.

4:03:27.560 --> 4:03:28.640
 It's not that much effort.

4:03:28.640 --> 4:03:29.720
 I totally agree.

4:03:29.720 --> 4:03:31.040
 And I think that humility,

4:03:31.040 --> 4:03:35.160
 it's a constant theme of your podcasts and I love that.

4:03:35.160 --> 4:03:39.040
 And so after the conversation debate,

4:03:39.040 --> 4:03:42.960
 whatever it was between Sanjay and Joe,

4:03:42.960 --> 4:03:45.840
 I reached out on Twitter to someone I've never met

4:03:45.840 --> 4:03:47.920
 in person, but I'm in touch privately

4:03:47.920 --> 4:03:49.680
 to a guy named Daniel Griffin,

4:03:49.680 --> 4:03:54.680
 who's a professor at Columbia Medical School

4:03:54.720 --> 4:03:56.160
 and just so smart there.

4:03:56.160 --> 4:04:00.880
 He gives regular updates on COVID 19

4:04:00.880 --> 4:04:03.680
 on a thing called TWIV this week in virology.

4:04:03.680 --> 4:04:08.680
 I'm a critic of TWIV for its coverage of origins.

4:04:09.640 --> 4:04:12.200
 But on this issue, I'm just having regular updates.

4:04:12.200 --> 4:04:13.640
 Daniel is great.

4:04:13.640 --> 4:04:15.480
 And so I said to him,

4:04:15.480 --> 4:04:20.480
 I said, why don't we have an honest process

4:04:20.680 --> 4:04:22.920
 to get the people who are raising concerns

4:04:22.920 --> 4:04:25.680
 about the vaccines in their own words

4:04:25.680 --> 4:04:28.400
 to raise what are their concerns?

4:04:28.400 --> 4:04:32.080
 And then let's do our best job of saying,

4:04:32.080 --> 4:04:34.040
 well, here are these concerns.

4:04:34.040 --> 4:04:38.400
 And then here is our evidence making a counterclaim

4:04:38.400 --> 4:04:41.800
 and here are links to if you want to look at the studies

4:04:41.800 --> 4:04:45.200
 upon which these claims are made, here they are.

4:04:45.200 --> 4:04:47.560
 And Daniel, who's incredibly busy,

4:04:47.560 --> 4:04:51.800
 I mean, he reads every, I mean, it seems every paper

4:04:51.800 --> 4:04:54.560
 that comes out every week and it's unbelievable.

4:04:55.640 --> 4:05:00.560
 But he sent me a link to the CDC Q&A page

4:05:00.560 --> 4:05:02.920
 on the CDC website.

4:05:02.920 --> 4:05:05.800
 And it wasn't that, it was people who were,

4:05:05.800 --> 4:05:07.800
 I mean, it was written by people like me

4:05:07.800 --> 4:05:12.800
 who were convinced in the benefit of these vaccines.

4:05:13.400 --> 4:05:16.920
 So the questions were framed, they were kind of like,

4:05:16.920 --> 4:05:19.720
 they weren't really the framing

4:05:19.720 --> 4:05:21.640
 of the people with the concerns.

4:05:21.640 --> 4:05:22.600
 They were framing of people

4:05:22.600 --> 4:05:25.200
 who were just kind of imagining something else.

4:05:25.200 --> 4:05:27.440
 I mean, you always talk about kind of humility

4:05:27.440 --> 4:05:29.280
 and active listening.

4:05:29.280 --> 4:05:31.800
 I know you don't mean, and it doesn't mean

4:05:31.800 --> 4:05:33.400
 that we don't stand for something.

4:05:33.400 --> 4:05:36.640
 Like I certainly am a strong proponent of vaccines

4:05:36.640 --> 4:05:38.720
 and masks and all of those things.

4:05:39.760 --> 4:05:42.160
 But if we don't hear other people,

4:05:42.160 --> 4:05:47.080
 if we don't let them hear their voice in the conversation,

4:05:47.080 --> 4:05:49.040
 if it's just saying, well, you may think this

4:05:49.040 --> 4:05:52.440
 and here's why it's wrong, the argument may be right.

4:05:52.440 --> 4:05:53.800
 It'll just never break through.

4:05:53.800 --> 4:05:56.200
 By the way, my interpretation of Joe and Sanjay,

4:05:56.200 --> 4:05:58.840
 I listened to that conversation without looking at Twitter

4:05:58.840 --> 4:06:01.960
 or the internet and I thought that was a great conversation

4:06:01.960 --> 4:06:04.680
 and I thought Sanjay actually really succeeded

4:06:04.680 --> 4:06:05.800
 in bringing the temperature down.

4:06:05.800 --> 4:06:08.600
 To me, the goal was bringing the temperature down.

4:06:08.600 --> 4:06:10.120
 I didn't even think of it as a debate.

4:06:10.120 --> 4:06:13.000
 I was like, oh, cool, this isn't gonna be some weird,

4:06:13.000 --> 4:06:15.200
 it's like two friendly people talking.

4:06:15.200 --> 4:06:16.840
 And then I look at the internet

4:06:16.840 --> 4:06:20.200
 and then the internet says, Joe Rogan slammed Sanjay

4:06:20.200 --> 4:06:24.520
 like as if it was a heated debate that Joe won.

4:06:24.520 --> 4:06:26.040
 And it's like, all right,

4:06:26.040 --> 4:06:30.080
 it's really the temperature being brought down.

4:06:30.080 --> 4:06:32.080
 Real conversation between two humans.

4:06:32.080 --> 4:06:34.160
 That wasn't really a debate.

4:06:34.160 --> 4:06:38.480
 It was just a conversation and that was a success.

4:06:38.480 --> 4:06:40.960
 I definitely think it was a success,

4:06:40.960 --> 4:06:45.960
 but I also felt that a takeaway,

4:06:47.720 --> 4:06:51.440
 and again, because this is something that I don't agree with,

4:06:51.440 --> 4:06:54.360
 even though I have great, as I've said, respect for Joe,

4:06:54.360 --> 4:06:58.320
 I think a reasonable person listening to that conversation

4:06:58.320 --> 4:07:00.680
 would come away with the conclusion

4:07:00.680 --> 4:07:05.120
 that all in all these vaccines are a good thing,

4:07:05.120 --> 4:07:10.120
 but if you're young and healthy, you probably don't need it.

4:07:11.000 --> 4:07:16.000
 And I just felt that there was a stronger case to be made,

4:07:16.200 --> 4:07:17.440
 even though Sanjay made it.

4:07:17.440 --> 4:07:19.400
 It wasn't that Sanjay didn't make it.

4:07:19.400 --> 4:07:22.160
 It was just that in the flow of that conversation,

4:07:22.160 --> 4:07:26.120
 I felt that the case for the vaccines

4:07:26.120 --> 4:07:28.960
 and the vaccines both as an individual choice

4:07:28.960 --> 4:07:31.000
 and then certainly again, as I said before,

4:07:31.000 --> 4:07:34.960
 I think that while people can be afraid of the vaccines,

4:07:34.960 --> 4:07:37.560
 the virus itself is much scarier

4:07:37.560 --> 4:07:40.760
 and we're seeing it now in real time

4:07:40.760 --> 4:07:43.840
 with these variations and variants.

4:07:43.840 --> 4:07:47.680
 I just felt that that was kind of the rough takeaway

4:07:47.680 --> 4:07:49.440
 from that conversation.

4:07:50.760 --> 4:07:54.120
 And I felt that Sanjay, again, whom I love,

4:07:54.120 --> 4:07:56.760
 I felt it could have made his case a little bit stronger.

4:07:56.760 --> 4:08:00.200
 So the thing he succeeded is he didn't come off

4:08:00.200 --> 4:08:05.200
 as like a science expert looking down at everybody,

4:08:07.120 --> 4:08:09.120
 talking down to everybody.

4:08:09.120 --> 4:08:12.000
 So he succeeded in that, which is very respectful.

4:08:12.000 --> 4:08:15.240
 But I also think sort of making the case

4:08:15.240 --> 4:08:19.240
 for taking the vaccine when you're a young, healthy person,

4:08:19.240 --> 4:08:22.040
 when you're sitting across from Joe Rogan

4:08:22.040 --> 4:08:26.080
 is like a high difficulty on the video game level.

4:08:26.080 --> 4:08:26.920
 For sure.

4:08:26.920 --> 4:08:30.200
 So it's difficult to do.

4:08:30.200 --> 4:08:31.520
 Yeah, for sure. It's difficult to do.

4:08:31.520 --> 4:08:32.840
 And also it's difficult to do

4:08:32.840 --> 4:08:37.840
 because it's not as simple as like, look at the data.

4:08:38.960 --> 4:08:42.840
 There's a lot of data to go through here.

4:08:42.840 --> 4:08:45.720
 And there's also a lot of non data stuff,

4:08:45.720 --> 4:08:48.600
 like the fact that, first of all,

4:08:48.600 --> 4:08:50.120
 questioning the sources of the data,

4:08:50.120 --> 4:08:51.680
 the quality of the data,

4:08:51.680 --> 4:08:54.040
 because it's also disappointing about COVID

4:08:54.040 --> 4:08:56.440
 is that the quality of the data is not great.

4:08:56.440 --> 4:09:00.640
 But also questioning all the motivations

4:09:00.640 --> 4:09:02.520
 of the different parties involved,

4:09:02.520 --> 4:09:04.280
 whether it's major organizations

4:09:04.280 --> 4:09:05.400
 that developed the vaccine,

4:09:05.400 --> 4:09:09.920
 whether it's major institutions like NIH or NIAID

4:09:09.920 --> 4:09:12.520
 that are sort of communicating to us about the vaccine,

4:09:12.520 --> 4:09:15.640
 whether it's the CDC and the WHO,

4:09:15.640 --> 4:09:18.180
 whether it's the Biden or the Trump administration,

4:09:18.180 --> 4:09:20.320
 whether it's China and all those kinds of things,

4:09:20.320 --> 4:09:24.160
 you have to, that's part of the conversation here.

4:09:24.160 --> 4:09:28.760
 I mean, vaccination is not just a public health tool.

4:09:28.760 --> 4:09:30.480
 It's also a tool for a government

4:09:30.480 --> 4:09:33.480
 to gain more control over the populace.

4:09:33.480 --> 4:09:36.320
 Like, there's a lot of truth to that too.

4:09:36.320 --> 4:09:38.220
 Things that have a lot of benefit

4:09:40.040 --> 4:09:44.280
 can also be used as a Trojan horse

4:09:44.280 --> 4:09:47.320
 to increase bureaucracy and control.

4:09:47.320 --> 4:09:49.960
 But that has to be on the table for a conversation.

4:09:49.960 --> 4:09:52.080
 I think it has to be on the conversation.

4:09:52.080 --> 4:09:56.640
 But your parents, when they were in the Soviet Union

4:09:56.640 --> 4:09:57.920
 and here in the United States,

4:09:57.920 --> 4:09:59.600
 and actually it was a big collaboration

4:09:59.600 --> 4:10:02.160
 between US and Soviet Union,

4:10:02.160 --> 4:10:04.200
 when the polio vaccine came out,

4:10:04.200 --> 4:10:06.160
 there were people all around the world

4:10:06.160 --> 4:10:08.400
 who had a different life trajectory,

4:10:08.400 --> 4:10:09.900
 no longer living in fear.

4:10:09.900 --> 4:10:11.880
 And all of these people who were paralyzed

4:10:11.880 --> 4:10:15.960
 or killed from polio, smallpox has been eradicated.

4:10:15.960 --> 4:10:20.280
 It was one of the great successes in human history.

4:10:20.280 --> 4:10:23.320
 And while it for sure is true that you could imagine

4:10:23.320 --> 4:10:27.800
 some kind of fraudulent vaccination effort,

4:10:27.800 --> 4:10:30.040
 but here I genuinely think,

4:10:30.040 --> 4:10:33.200
 I mean, whatever the number, 15 million, 16 million

4:10:33.200 --> 4:10:37.080
 is the economist number of dead from COVID 19,

4:10:37.080 --> 4:10:39.800
 many, many, many more people would be dead

4:10:39.800 --> 4:10:41.780
 but for these vaccines.

4:10:41.780 --> 4:10:44.360
 And so I get that any activity

4:10:44.360 --> 4:10:47.720
 that needs to be coordinated by a central government

4:10:47.720 --> 4:10:50.680
 has the potential to increase bureaucracy

4:10:50.680 --> 4:10:53.640
 and increase control.

4:10:53.640 --> 4:10:57.900
 But there are certain things that central governments do,

4:10:57.900 --> 4:11:00.880
 like the development, particularly these mRNA vaccines,

4:11:00.880 --> 4:11:05.080
 which it's purely a US government victory.

4:11:05.080 --> 4:11:08.020
 I mean, it was huge DARPA funding

4:11:08.020 --> 4:11:11.040
 and then the National Institute for Allergy

4:11:11.040 --> 4:11:13.540
 and Infectious Disease, NIH funding.

4:11:13.540 --> 4:11:17.080
 I mean, this was a public private partnership throughout

4:11:17.080 --> 4:11:21.120
 and that we got a working vaccine 11 months was a miracle.

4:11:21.120 --> 4:11:21.960
 So I, yeah.

4:11:21.960 --> 4:11:23.300
 It's not purely a victory.

4:11:24.320 --> 4:11:26.160
 Again, you have to be open minded.

4:11:26.160 --> 4:11:30.400
 I'm with you here playing a bit of devil's advocate,

4:11:30.400 --> 4:11:32.640
 but the people who discuss any viral drugs

4:11:32.640 --> 4:11:34.840
 like ivermectin and other alternatives

4:11:34.840 --> 4:11:38.120
 would say that the extreme focus on the vaccine

4:11:39.040 --> 4:11:42.120
 distracted us from considering other possibilities.

4:11:42.120 --> 4:11:46.080
 And saying that this is purely a success

4:11:46.080 --> 4:11:48.080
 is distracting from the story

4:11:48.080 --> 4:11:50.660
 that there could have been other solutions.

4:11:50.660 --> 4:11:52.400
 So yes, it's a huge success

4:11:52.400 --> 4:11:55.080
 that the vaccine was developed so quickly

4:11:55.980 --> 4:12:00.660
 and surprisingly way more effective than it was hoped for.

4:12:02.200 --> 4:12:04.520
 But there could have been other solutions

4:12:04.520 --> 4:12:08.040
 and they completely distracted from us from that.

4:12:08.040 --> 4:12:11.640
 In fact, it distracted us from looking into a bunch of things

4:12:11.640 --> 4:12:12.960
 like the lab leak.

4:12:12.960 --> 4:12:15.720
 And so it's not a pure victory.

4:12:15.720 --> 4:12:18.160
 And there's a lot of people that criticize

4:12:18.160 --> 4:12:20.680
 the overreach of government and all of this.

4:12:20.680 --> 4:12:23.480
 That one of the things that makes the United States great

4:12:24.480 --> 4:12:29.480
 is the individualism and the hesitancy to ideas of mandates.

4:12:31.560 --> 4:12:35.180
 Even if the mandates on mass will have a positive,

4:12:35.180 --> 4:12:37.320
 even strongly positive result,

4:12:37.320 --> 4:12:42.320
 many Americans will still say no.

4:12:43.000 --> 4:12:46.840
 Because in the long arc of history,

4:12:46.840 --> 4:12:49.740
 saying no in that moment will actually lead

4:12:49.740 --> 4:12:53.680
 to a better country and a better world.

4:12:53.680 --> 4:12:57.360
 So that's a messed up aspect of America,

4:12:57.360 --> 4:12:59.960
 but it's also a beautiful part.

4:12:59.960 --> 4:13:03.900
 We're skeptical even about good things.

4:13:03.900 --> 4:13:08.280
 I agree and certainly we should all be cautious

4:13:08.280 --> 4:13:11.560
 about government overreach, absolutely.

4:13:11.560 --> 4:13:14.560
 And it happens in all kinds of scenarios

4:13:14.560 --> 4:13:17.400
 with incarceration with a thousand things.

4:13:17.400 --> 4:13:21.000
 And we also should be afraid of government underreach

4:13:21.000 --> 4:13:24.060
 that if there is a problem that could be solved

4:13:24.060 --> 4:13:26.120
 by governments and that's why we have governments

4:13:26.120 --> 4:13:28.200
 in the first place is that there's just certain things

4:13:28.200 --> 4:13:31.100
 that individuals can't do on their own.

4:13:31.100 --> 4:13:34.000
 And that's why we pool our resources

4:13:34.000 --> 4:13:38.200
 and we, in some ways, sacrifice our rights

4:13:38.200 --> 4:13:39.160
 for this common thing.

4:13:39.160 --> 4:13:41.200
 And that's why we don't have, hopefully,

4:13:41.200 --> 4:13:42.960
 people, murderers marauding

4:13:42.960 --> 4:13:45.480
 or people driving 200 miles down the street.

4:13:45.480 --> 4:13:49.880
 We have a process for arriving at a set of common rules.

4:13:49.880 --> 4:13:52.720
 And so, while I fully agree that we need to respect

4:13:52.720 --> 4:13:56.440
 and we need to listen, we need to find that right balance.

4:13:56.440 --> 4:14:00.020
 And you've raised the magic I word, ivermectin.

4:14:00.020 --> 4:14:05.020
 And so, an ivermectin, like my view has always been,

4:14:06.340 --> 4:14:09.620
 ivermectin could be effective, it could not be effective.

4:14:09.620 --> 4:14:12.080
 Let's study it through a full process.

4:14:12.080 --> 4:14:14.420
 And when you had Francis Collins with you,

4:14:14.420 --> 4:14:19.420
 even while he was making up stories about this wrestler,

4:14:19.900 --> 4:14:22.140
 he was saying, yeah, exactly.

4:14:22.140 --> 4:14:25.180
 But he was saying that they're going to do

4:14:25.180 --> 4:14:28.520
 a full randomized highest level trial of ivermectin.

4:14:28.520 --> 4:14:30.140
 And if ivermectin works,

4:14:30.140 --> 4:14:32.780
 then that's another tool in our toolbox.

4:14:32.780 --> 4:14:34.020
 And I think we should.

4:14:34.020 --> 4:14:37.760
 And I think that Sanjay was absolutely correct

4:14:37.760 --> 4:14:40.700
 to concede the point to Joe,

4:14:40.700 --> 4:14:43.180
 that it was disingenuous for people,

4:14:43.180 --> 4:14:45.220
 including people on CNN,

4:14:45.220 --> 4:14:48.980
 to say that ivermectin is for livestock.

4:14:48.980 --> 4:14:52.380
 And so, I definitely think that we have to,

4:14:53.260 --> 4:14:55.500
 like we have to have some kind of process

4:14:55.500 --> 4:14:57.540
 that allows us to come together.

4:14:57.540 --> 4:15:01.860
 And I totally agree that the great strength of America

4:15:01.860 --> 4:15:03.480
 is that we empower individuals.

4:15:03.480 --> 4:15:06.900
 It's the history of our frontier mentality in our country.

4:15:06.900 --> 4:15:11.460
 So we, I 100% agree that we have to allow that,

4:15:11.460 --> 4:15:15.580
 even if sometimes it creates messy processes

4:15:15.580 --> 4:15:18.380
 and uncomfortable feelings and all those sorts of things.

4:15:19.940 --> 4:15:22.660
 You are an ultra marathon runner.

4:15:22.660 --> 4:15:23.500
 Yes.

4:15:23.500 --> 4:15:27.180
 What are you running from?

4:15:27.180 --> 4:15:28.020
 No.

4:15:28.020 --> 4:15:30.660
 It's the right, it's the funny thing is,

4:15:30.660 --> 4:15:34.180
 so I'm an ultra marathoner and I've done 13 Ironmans.

4:15:34.180 --> 4:15:36.300
 And people say, oh my God, that's amazing.

4:15:36.300 --> 4:15:37.140
 13 Ironmans.

4:15:37.140 --> 4:15:41.060
 And what I always say, no, one Ironman is impressive.

4:15:41.060 --> 4:15:44.340
 13 Ironmans, there's something effing wrong with you.

4:15:44.340 --> 4:15:45.740
 We just need to figure out what it is.

4:15:45.740 --> 4:15:48.500
 Yeah, there's some demons you're trying to work through.

4:15:48.500 --> 4:15:49.980
 I mean, well, you're doing the work though.

4:15:49.980 --> 4:15:53.980
 Most people just kind of let the demons sit in the attic.

4:15:53.980 --> 4:15:57.260
 No, what have you learned about yourself,

4:15:57.260 --> 4:16:00.260
 about your mind, about your body, about life,

4:16:00.260 --> 4:16:05.260
 from taking your body limit in that kind of way

4:16:05.380 --> 4:16:07.020
 to running those kinds of distances?

4:16:07.020 --> 4:16:08.220
 Well, it's a great question.

4:16:08.220 --> 4:16:10.140
 And I know that you are also kind of exploring

4:16:10.140 --> 4:16:12.540
 the limits of the physical.

4:16:12.540 --> 4:16:17.260
 And so for me in doing the Ironmans and the ultra marathons,

4:16:17.260 --> 4:16:20.420
 it's always the same kind of lesson,

4:16:20.420 --> 4:16:25.420
 which is just when you think you have nothing left,

4:16:25.540 --> 4:16:27.900
 you actually have a ton left.

4:16:27.900 --> 4:16:31.180
 There are a lot of resources that are there

4:16:31.180 --> 4:16:32.860
 if you call on them.

4:16:32.860 --> 4:16:37.860
 And the ability to call on them has to be cultivated.

4:16:38.580 --> 4:16:42.420
 And so for me, especially in the Ironman,

4:16:42.420 --> 4:16:45.900
 and Ironman in many ways is harder than the ultra marathons

4:16:45.900 --> 4:16:48.180
 because I'll be at, I mean, it's 140 miles.

4:16:48.180 --> 4:16:52.900
 I'll be at a 100 mile, 120, having done the swim

4:16:52.900 --> 4:16:55.180
 and then the bike and I'll be whatever,

4:16:56.100 --> 4:16:58.420
 six miles into the run.

4:16:58.420 --> 4:17:01.420
 And I'll think, I feel like shit.

4:17:01.420 --> 4:17:02.940
 I have nothing left.

4:17:02.940 --> 4:17:07.740
 How am I possibly gonna run 20 miles more?

4:17:07.740 --> 4:17:10.580
 But there's always more.

4:17:10.580 --> 4:17:15.500
 And I think that for me, these extreme sports

4:17:15.500 --> 4:17:20.500
 are my process of exploring what's possible.

4:17:21.100 --> 4:17:25.220
 And I feel like it applies in so many different areas

4:17:25.220 --> 4:17:28.140
 of life where you're kind of pushing

4:17:28.140 --> 4:17:30.540
 and it feels like the limit.

4:17:30.540 --> 4:17:33.140
 And one of my friend of mine,

4:17:33.140 --> 4:17:35.820
 who I just have so much respect for,

4:17:35.820 --> 4:17:37.300
 who actually be a great guest

4:17:37.300 --> 4:17:41.300
 if you haven't already interviewed him is Charlie Angle.

4:17:41.300 --> 4:17:44.180
 And Charlie, he was a drug addict.

4:17:44.180 --> 4:17:47.220
 He was in prison, his life was total shit.

4:17:48.140 --> 4:17:50.940
 And somehow, and I can't remember the full story,

4:17:50.940 --> 4:17:55.660
 he just started running around the prison yard.

4:17:55.660 --> 4:17:56.500
 And it's like Forrest Gump.

4:17:56.500 --> 4:17:59.220
 And he just kept running and running.

4:17:59.220 --> 4:18:02.380
 And then he got out of prison and he kept running

4:18:02.380 --> 4:18:04.820
 and he started doing ultra marathons,

4:18:04.820 --> 4:18:07.660
 started inspiring all these other people.

4:18:07.660 --> 4:18:09.060
 Now he's written all these books.

4:18:09.060 --> 4:18:12.500
 As a matter of fact, we just spoke a few months ago

4:18:12.500 --> 4:18:17.500
 that he's planning on running from the Dead Sea

4:18:18.140 --> 4:18:20.420
 to somehow to the top of Mount Everest,

4:18:20.420 --> 4:18:23.500
 from the lowest point to the highest point on earth.

4:18:23.500 --> 4:18:25.980
 And I said, well, why are you stopping there?

4:18:25.980 --> 4:18:29.420
 Why don't you get whatever camera in

4:18:29.420 --> 4:18:32.220
 and go down to the lowest part of the ocean,

4:18:32.220 --> 4:18:34.020
 go to the lowest part of the ocean

4:18:34.020 --> 4:18:38.260
 and then talk to Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos

4:18:38.260 --> 4:18:40.220
 and go to the kind of the highest place

4:18:40.220 --> 4:18:42.180
 than the stratosphere you can get.

4:18:42.180 --> 4:18:44.700
 But it's this thing of possibility.

4:18:44.700 --> 4:18:49.140
 And I just feel like so many of us and myself included,

4:18:49.140 --> 4:18:54.140
 we get stuck in a sense of what we think is our range.

4:18:54.620 --> 4:18:57.820
 And if we're not careful, that can become our range.

4:18:57.820 --> 4:19:00.900
 And that's why for me in all of life,

4:19:00.900 --> 4:19:02.500
 it's all about like we've been talking about,

4:19:02.500 --> 4:19:06.260
 challenging the limits, challenging assumptions,

4:19:06.260 --> 4:19:09.540
 challenging ourselves and hopefully,

4:19:09.540 --> 4:19:12.940
 we do it in a way that kind of doesn't hurt anybody.

4:19:12.940 --> 4:19:15.900
 When I'm at the Ironman, they have all these little kids

4:19:15.900 --> 4:19:17.060
 and they'll have these little shirts

4:19:17.060 --> 4:19:19.220
 and it'll say like, my dad is a hero

4:19:19.220 --> 4:19:21.060
 and have the little Ironman logo.

4:19:21.060 --> 4:19:22.860
 And I wanna say, it's like, no,

4:19:22.860 --> 4:19:25.300
 your dad is actually a narcissistic dick

4:19:25.300 --> 4:19:29.540
 who goes on eight mile bike rides every Sunday

4:19:29.540 --> 4:19:31.540
 rather than spend time with you.

4:19:31.540 --> 4:19:34.020
 And so we shouldn't hurt anybody.

4:19:34.020 --> 4:19:38.700
 But for me, and also I just find it very enjoyable

4:19:38.700 --> 4:19:41.340
 and I hope I'm not disclosing too much

4:19:41.340 --> 4:19:44.060
 about our conversation before we went live

4:19:44.060 --> 4:19:46.020
 where you're doing so many different things

4:19:46.020 --> 4:19:48.740
 with running and your martial arts.

4:19:48.740 --> 4:19:53.620
 And I encouraged you to do ultra marathons

4:19:53.620 --> 4:19:55.220
 because there's so many great ones in Texas.

4:19:55.220 --> 4:19:58.900
 It's actually surprisingly a very enjoyable way

4:19:58.900 --> 4:19:59.740
 to spend a day.

4:19:59.740 --> 4:20:01.100
 Like how would you recommend?

4:20:01.100 --> 4:20:03.420
 So yeah, for people who might not know,

4:20:03.420 --> 4:20:05.060
 I've never actually even run a marathon.

4:20:05.060 --> 4:20:08.420
 I've run 22 miles in one time at most.

4:20:08.420 --> 4:20:13.420
 I did a four by four by 48 challenge with David Goggins

4:20:13.860 --> 4:20:16.340
 where you run four miles every four hours.

4:20:16.340 --> 4:20:19.380
 Is it different as less to do with the distance

4:20:19.380 --> 4:20:21.620
 and more to do with the sleep deprivation.

4:20:21.620 --> 4:20:24.220
 What advice would you give to a first time ultra marathon

4:20:24.220 --> 4:20:27.180
 or like me trying to run 50 or more miles

4:20:27.180 --> 4:20:30.260
 or for anybody else interested

4:20:30.260 --> 4:20:32.340
 in this kind of exploration of their range?

4:20:32.340 --> 4:20:36.940
 What I always tell is the same advice is register.

4:20:36.940 --> 4:20:39.540
 Pick your timeline of when you think you can be ready.

4:20:39.540 --> 4:20:41.140
 Make it, depending on where you are now,

4:20:41.140 --> 4:20:43.100
 make it six months, make a year,

4:20:43.100 --> 4:20:45.300
 and then register for the race.

4:20:45.300 --> 4:20:47.060
 And then once you're registered,

4:20:47.060 --> 4:20:49.820
 just work back from there, what's it going to take?

4:20:49.820 --> 4:20:52.780
 But one of the things for people who are just getting going,

4:20:52.780 --> 4:20:53.980
 you really do need to make sure

4:20:53.980 --> 4:20:55.940
 that your body is ready for it.

4:20:55.940 --> 4:20:59.100
 And so particularly, and particularly as we get older,

4:20:59.100 --> 4:21:02.660
 strengthening is really important.

4:21:02.660 --> 4:21:06.260
 So I'll do a plug for my brother, Jordan Metzl.

4:21:06.260 --> 4:21:08.380
 He's a doctor at hospital for special surgery,

4:21:08.380 --> 4:21:10.740
 but his whole thing is functional strength.

4:21:10.740 --> 4:21:12.740
 And so, and people know about,

4:21:12.740 --> 4:21:15.140
 and you can actually even go to his website.

4:21:15.140 --> 4:21:17.420
 You can just Google Jordan Metzl Iron Strength,

4:21:17.420 --> 4:21:19.180
 but it's all about like burpees

4:21:19.180 --> 4:21:21.380
 and just building your muscular strength

4:21:21.380 --> 4:21:25.060
 so that you don't get injured as you increase.

4:21:25.060 --> 4:21:27.740
 And then just increase your mileage with,

4:21:27.740 --> 4:21:31.340
 in some steady way, make sure that you take rest days

4:21:31.340 --> 4:21:34.540
 and listen to your body because people like you

4:21:34.540 --> 4:21:37.140
 who are just very kind of mind over matter,

4:21:37.140 --> 4:21:39.460
 like you were telling me before about you have an injury,

4:21:39.460 --> 4:21:41.780
 but you kind of run a little bit differently.

4:21:41.780 --> 4:21:44.420
 And we need to listen to our bodies

4:21:44.420 --> 4:21:47.660
 because our bodies are communicating.

4:21:48.980 --> 4:21:53.460
 But I think it was kind of little by little magic is possible.

4:21:53.460 --> 4:21:54.780
 And what I will say is,

4:21:54.780 --> 4:21:58.300
 and I also have done lots and lots of marathons,

4:21:58.300 --> 4:22:01.620
 and I always tell people that the ultra marathons,

4:22:01.620 --> 4:22:02.540
 at least the ones that I do,

4:22:02.540 --> 4:22:04.100
 and I shouldn't misrepresent myself.

4:22:04.100 --> 4:22:07.540
 I mean, there are people who do 500 mile races.

4:22:07.540 --> 4:22:11.220
 The ones that I do are 50K mountain trail runs,

4:22:11.220 --> 4:22:12.620
 which is 32 miles.

4:22:12.620 --> 4:22:17.620
 So I do the kind of the easier side of ultras,

4:22:17.900 --> 4:22:19.820
 but it's actually much easier than a marathon

4:22:19.820 --> 4:22:21.940
 because some of the mountain ones,

4:22:21.940 --> 4:22:25.540
 sometimes it's so steep that you can't,

4:22:25.540 --> 4:22:26.900
 you have to walk it

4:22:26.900 --> 4:22:29.180
 because walking is faster than running.

4:22:29.180 --> 4:22:32.140
 And every four or five miles in the supported races,

4:22:32.140 --> 4:22:35.500
 you stop and eat blintzes and foiled potatoes.

4:22:35.500 --> 4:22:36.820
 It's actually quite enjoyable.

4:22:36.820 --> 4:22:41.200
 But as I started to tell you before we went live,

4:22:42.100 --> 4:22:43.860
 so I've done for lots of years,

4:22:43.860 --> 4:22:45.540
 these 50K mountain trail runs,

4:22:45.540 --> 4:22:48.220
 and I was going to Taiwan a number of years ago

4:22:48.220 --> 4:22:49.300
 for something else.

4:22:49.300 --> 4:22:50.860
 And I thought, well, wouldn't it be fun

4:22:50.860 --> 4:22:53.020
 to do an ultra marathon in Taiwan?

4:22:53.020 --> 4:22:56.940
 I looked and that the weekend after my visit,

4:22:56.940 --> 4:22:57.940
 there was a marathon.

4:22:57.940 --> 4:22:59.060
 It was called the,

4:22:59.060 --> 4:23:01.820
 every ultra marathon, it was called the Taiwan Beast.

4:23:01.820 --> 4:23:03.980
 And I figured, oh, beasts, what are they talking about?

4:23:03.980 --> 4:23:05.180
 It's 50K mountain trail,

4:23:05.180 --> 4:23:06.580
 and I've done a million of them.

4:23:06.580 --> 4:23:07.840
 And then I went to register.

4:23:07.840 --> 4:23:09.300
 And then as part of registration,

4:23:09.300 --> 4:23:11.500
 they said, you need to have all of this equipment.

4:23:11.500 --> 4:23:14.940
 And it was all this like wilderness survival equipment.

4:23:14.940 --> 4:23:17.460
 And I was thinking, God, these Taiwanese,

4:23:17.460 --> 4:23:18.940
 but what a bunch of wimps.

4:23:18.940 --> 4:23:22.340
 You have to carry, give me a break, 50K mountain trail.

4:23:22.340 --> 4:23:24.500
 So I get there and the race starts

4:23:24.500 --> 4:23:27.540
 at like 4.30 in the morning in the middle of nowhere.

4:23:27.540 --> 4:23:28.620
 And you have to wear headlamps

4:23:28.620 --> 4:23:29.820
 and everyone's carrying all this stuff.

4:23:29.820 --> 4:23:34.820
 And you kind of go running out into the rainforest.

4:23:34.820 --> 4:23:36.740
 It was the hardest thing I've ever done in my,

4:23:36.740 --> 4:23:38.180
 it took 19 hours.

4:23:38.180 --> 4:23:41.540
 There were maybe 15 cliff faces, like a real cliff.

4:23:41.540 --> 4:23:44.500
 And somebody had dangled like a little piece of string.

4:23:44.500 --> 4:23:46.900
 And so you had to hold onto the string with one hand

4:23:46.900 --> 4:23:49.380
 while it was in the pouring rain, climb up these cliffs.

4:23:49.380 --> 4:23:52.740
 There were maybe 20 river crossings,

4:23:52.740 --> 4:23:57.100
 but not just like a little stream, like a torrential river.

4:23:57.100 --> 4:24:00.140
 There were some things where it was so steep

4:24:00.140 --> 4:24:02.060
 that everyone was just climbing up

4:24:02.060 --> 4:24:03.980
 and then you'd slide all the way down and climb up.

4:24:03.980 --> 4:24:07.060
 And there were people who I met on the way out there

4:24:07.060 --> 4:24:07.900
 who were saying, oh yeah,

4:24:07.900 --> 4:24:11.540
 I did the Sahara 500 kilometer race.

4:24:11.540 --> 4:24:15.220
 And those people were just sprawled out.

4:24:15.220 --> 4:24:17.460
 A lot of them didn't finish.

4:24:17.460 --> 4:24:19.780
 So that was the hardest thing I've ever.

4:24:19.780 --> 4:24:22.060
 So how do you get through something like that?

4:24:22.060 --> 4:24:23.600
 You just, one step at a time?

4:24:23.600 --> 4:24:26.380
 Was there, do you remember, is there a?

4:24:26.380 --> 4:24:27.220
 Yeah.

4:24:27.220 --> 4:24:28.500
 Is there a dark moments

4:24:28.500 --> 4:24:31.140
 or is it kind of all spread out thinly?

4:24:31.140 --> 4:24:34.100
 It wasn't really dark moments.

4:24:34.100 --> 4:24:36.620
 I mean, there was one thing where I'd been running so long

4:24:36.620 --> 4:24:39.020
 I thought, well, I must almost be done.

4:24:39.020 --> 4:24:43.060
 And then I found out I had like 15 miles more.

4:24:44.700 --> 4:24:48.420
 But I guess with all of these things,

4:24:48.420 --> 4:24:51.700
 it's the messages that we tell ourselves.

4:24:51.700 --> 4:24:55.500
 And so for me, it's like the message I always tell myself

4:24:55.500 --> 4:24:58.740
 is quitting isn't an option.

4:24:58.740 --> 4:25:00.700
 I mean, once in a while you kind of have to quit

4:25:00.700 --> 4:25:02.420
 if like, listen to the universe,

4:25:02.420 --> 4:25:04.800
 if whatever, you're gonna kill yourself or something.

4:25:04.800 --> 4:25:08.500
 But for me, it was just, whatever it takes,

4:25:08.500 --> 4:25:10.140
 there's no way I'm stopping.

4:25:10.140 --> 4:25:14.220
 And if I have to go up this muddy hill 20 times

4:25:14.220 --> 4:25:17.760
 because I keep sliding, I'm sure there's a way.

4:25:17.760 --> 4:25:19.620
 It's probably a personality flaw.

4:25:21.540 --> 4:25:23.880
 Where does your love for chocolate come from?

4:25:23.880 --> 4:25:24.940
 Oh, it's a great question.

4:25:24.940 --> 4:25:27.420
 And in both of my Joe Rogan interviews,

4:25:27.420 --> 4:25:29.020
 that's the first question that he asked.

4:25:29.020 --> 4:25:30.940
 So I'm glad that we've gotten to that.

4:25:30.940 --> 4:25:33.900
 So one, I've always loved chocolate.

4:25:33.900 --> 4:25:37.900
 And I call it like a secret, but now that I keep telling,

4:25:37.900 --> 4:25:39.540
 if you keep telling the same secret,

4:25:39.540 --> 4:25:42.060
 it's actually no longer a secret,

4:25:42.060 --> 4:25:45.180
 that I have a secret, which is not secret

4:25:45.180 --> 4:25:47.740
 because I'm telling you on a podcast,

4:25:47.740 --> 4:25:50.140
 life as a chocolate shaman.

4:25:50.140 --> 4:25:53.540
 And so when I give keynotes at tech conferences,

4:25:53.540 --> 4:25:55.580
 I always say, I'm happy to give a keynote,

4:25:55.580 --> 4:25:59.040
 but I want to lead a sacred cacao ceremony in the night.

4:25:59.040 --> 4:26:00.580
 I'm actually, believe it or not,

4:26:00.580 --> 4:26:02.580
 the official chocolate shaman

4:26:02.580 --> 4:26:05.180
 of what used to be called exponential medicine,

4:26:05.180 --> 4:26:06.700
 which is part of Singularity University.

4:26:06.700 --> 4:26:09.620
 Now, my friend Daniel Kraft who runs it,

4:26:09.620 --> 4:26:12.620
 it's going to be called NextMed.

4:26:12.620 --> 4:26:14.820
 And so, but I'll have to go back.

4:26:14.820 --> 4:26:19.460
 As I was going to Berlin a lot of years ago,

4:26:19.460 --> 4:26:20.560
 and I've always loved chocolate,

4:26:20.560 --> 4:26:23.780
 I was going to Berlin to give a keynote

4:26:23.780 --> 4:26:28.420
 at a big conference called TOA, Tech Open Air.

4:26:28.420 --> 4:26:31.820
 And so when I got there, the first night,

4:26:31.820 --> 4:26:33.020
 I was supposed to give a talk,

4:26:33.020 --> 4:26:34.540
 but there had been some mix up.

4:26:34.540 --> 4:26:36.700
 They'd forgotten to reserve the room.

4:26:36.700 --> 4:26:38.340
 And so the talk got canceled.

4:26:38.340 --> 4:26:41.300
 And in the brochure, they had all these different events

4:26:41.300 --> 4:26:44.060
 around Berlin that you could go to.

4:26:44.060 --> 4:26:46.260
 And one of them was a cacao ceremony.

4:26:46.260 --> 4:26:49.660
 And so I went there and actually met somebody,

4:26:49.660 --> 4:26:52.100
 Viviana, who is still a friend,

4:26:52.100 --> 4:26:53.460
 but I met, going in there,

4:26:53.460 --> 4:26:54.740
 and there was this cacao ceremony.

4:26:54.740 --> 4:26:56.640
 These kind of hippie dudes.

4:26:56.640 --> 4:26:59.700
 And then everybody got the cacao.

4:26:59.700 --> 4:27:01.060
 And then they said, all right,

4:27:01.060 --> 4:27:03.180
 as they talked a little bit about the process,

4:27:03.180 --> 4:27:04.020
 and then they said, all right,

4:27:04.020 --> 4:27:06.620
 everyone just stand and kind of,

4:27:06.620 --> 4:27:09.580
 we're going to spin around in a circle for 45 minutes.

4:27:09.580 --> 4:27:12.900
 And so I spun around in the circle for like 10 minutes,

4:27:12.900 --> 4:27:14.140
 but then I had to leave

4:27:14.140 --> 4:27:15.880
 because I had to go to something else.

4:27:15.880 --> 4:27:18.500
 And so that, I thought that was that.

4:27:18.500 --> 4:27:21.100
 But then I saw Viviana the next day,

4:27:21.100 --> 4:27:23.260
 and I said, well, how did the cacao ceremony go?

4:27:23.260 --> 4:27:25.340
 And she showed me these pictures

4:27:25.340 --> 4:27:28.420
 of all of these people, mostly naked,

4:27:28.420 --> 4:27:30.620
 like it turned into chaos.

4:27:30.620 --> 4:27:31.460
 Oh, that's awesome.

4:27:31.460 --> 4:27:33.700
 And it was like, oh, and so let me get this straight.

4:27:33.700 --> 4:27:35.620
 People drank chocolate,

4:27:35.620 --> 4:27:37.700
 then they spun around in a circle,

4:27:37.700 --> 4:27:39.200
 and something else happened.

4:27:39.200 --> 4:27:41.420
 And anyway, so then two days later,

4:27:41.420 --> 4:27:43.820
 I was invited to another cacao ceremony,

4:27:43.820 --> 4:27:46.380
 which was also actually part of this Toa.

4:27:46.380 --> 4:27:48.660
 And that was kind of more structured,

4:27:48.660 --> 4:27:51.180
 and it was more sane because it was part of this thing.

4:27:51.180 --> 4:27:53.700
 And at the end of that, I had this,

4:27:53.700 --> 4:27:56.900
 I thought one, the greatest thing ever,

4:27:56.900 --> 4:27:58.540
 a sacred cacao ceremony,

4:27:58.540 --> 4:28:01.500
 like you drink chocolate milk and everybody's free.

4:28:01.500 --> 4:28:05.700
 And I love that idea because I've never done drugs,

4:28:05.700 --> 4:28:07.180
 I don't drink.

4:28:07.180 --> 4:28:09.400
 But just part of it is because I think whatever,

4:28:09.400 --> 4:28:12.020
 like I was saying with the ultra running,

4:28:12.020 --> 4:28:14.100
 all of the possibilities are within us

4:28:14.100 --> 4:28:16.820
 if we can get out of our own way.

4:28:16.820 --> 4:28:17.740
 And then I thought, well, you know,

4:28:17.740 --> 4:28:20.180
 I think I can do a better job

4:28:20.180 --> 4:28:22.300
 than what I experienced in Berlin.

4:28:22.300 --> 4:28:23.520
 So I came back and I thought, all right,

4:28:23.520 --> 4:28:26.140
 I'm gonna get accredited as a cacao shaman.

4:28:26.140 --> 4:28:27.560
 And this will shock you.

4:28:27.560 --> 4:28:30.180
 Because I know if you're gonna be like a rabbi

4:28:30.180 --> 4:28:32.040
 or a priest or something, there's some process.

4:28:32.040 --> 4:28:35.100
 But shockingly, there's no official process

4:28:35.100 --> 4:28:38.140
 to become a chocolate shaman.

4:28:38.140 --> 4:28:40.540
 And so I thought, all right, well, you know,

4:28:40.540 --> 4:28:42.180
 I'm just gonna train myself.

4:28:42.180 --> 4:28:45.180
 And when I'm ready, I'm gonna declare my chocolate shamanism.

4:28:45.180 --> 4:28:47.380
 So I started studying different things.

4:28:47.380 --> 4:28:50.320
 And when I was ready, I just said,

4:28:50.320 --> 4:28:52.780
 now I'm a chocolate shaman, self declared.

4:28:52.780 --> 4:28:53.620
 Self declared.

4:28:53.620 --> 4:28:55.500
 And so, but I do these ceremonies

4:28:55.500 --> 4:28:58.340
 and I've done them at tech conferences.

4:28:58.340 --> 4:29:01.060
 I did one in Soho House in New York.

4:29:01.060 --> 4:29:04.180
 I've done it at a place Rancho La Puerta in Mexico.

4:29:04.180 --> 4:29:05.980
 And every time it's the same thing.

4:29:05.980 --> 4:29:10.220
 Because it just, if people are given a license to be free,

4:29:10.220 --> 4:29:13.420
 just to, it doesn't matter, and what I always say is,

4:29:13.420 --> 4:29:15.260
 you're here for a sacred cacao ceremony,

4:29:15.260 --> 4:29:18.340
 but the truth is there's no such thing as sacred cacao.

4:29:18.340 --> 4:29:19.700
 And there's no sacred mountains

4:29:19.700 --> 4:29:22.420
 and there's no sacred people and there's no sacred plants.

4:29:22.420 --> 4:29:25.780
 Because nothing is sacred if we don't attribute,

4:29:25.780 --> 4:29:28.820
 ascribe sacredness to it.

4:29:28.820 --> 4:29:32.420
 But if we recognize that everything is sacred,

4:29:32.420 --> 4:29:33.700
 then we'll live different lives.

4:29:33.700 --> 4:29:36.180
 And for the purpose of this ceremony,

4:29:36.180 --> 4:29:37.620
 we're just gonna say, all right,

4:29:37.620 --> 4:29:39.940
 we're gonna focus on this cacao,

4:29:39.940 --> 4:29:43.420
 which actually has been used ceremonially for 5,000 years.

4:29:43.420 --> 4:29:46.120
 It has all these wonderful properties.

4:29:47.020 --> 4:29:49.480
 But it's just people who get that license

4:29:49.480 --> 4:29:52.260
 and then they're just free and people are dancing

4:29:52.260 --> 4:29:53.100
 and all sorts of things.

4:29:53.100 --> 4:29:57.140
 Is the goal to celebrate life in general?

4:29:57.140 --> 4:30:00.640
 Is it to celebrate the senses, like taste?

4:30:00.640 --> 4:30:03.020
 Is it to celebrate yourself, each other?

4:30:03.020 --> 4:30:04.100
 What is there?

4:30:04.100 --> 4:30:09.020
 I think the core is gratitude and just appreciation.

4:30:09.020 --> 4:30:10.460
 All the experiences in life?

4:30:10.460 --> 4:30:12.460
 Yeah, just of being alive,

4:30:12.460 --> 4:30:15.100
 of just living in this sacred world

4:30:15.100 --> 4:30:16.340
 where we have all these things

4:30:16.340 --> 4:30:19.540
 that we don't even pay any attention to.

4:30:19.540 --> 4:30:23.080
 My friend, A.J. Jacobs, he had a wonderful book

4:30:23.080 --> 4:30:27.020
 that I use the spirit of it in the ceremonies,

4:30:27.020 --> 4:30:31.060
 not the exactly, but he was in a restaurant in New York,

4:30:31.060 --> 4:30:33.220
 a coffee shop, and his child said,

4:30:33.220 --> 4:30:35.020
 hey, where does the coffee come from?

4:30:35.020 --> 4:30:38.820
 And he's like a wonderful big thinker.

4:30:38.820 --> 4:30:41.060
 And he started really answering that question.

4:30:41.060 --> 4:30:42.700
 Well, here's where the beans come from,

4:30:42.700 --> 4:30:44.300
 but how did the beans get here

4:30:44.300 --> 4:30:46.260
 and who painted the yellow line on the street

4:30:46.260 --> 4:30:50.140
 so the truck didn't crash and who made the cup?

4:30:50.140 --> 4:30:53.120
 And he spent a year making a full spreadsheet

4:30:53.120 --> 4:30:56.460
 of all of the people who in one way or another

4:30:56.460 --> 4:31:00.300
 played some role in that one cup of coffee.

4:31:00.300 --> 4:31:03.500
 And he traveled all around the world thanking them.

4:31:03.500 --> 4:31:05.100
 Like, it's like, thank you for painting

4:31:05.100 --> 4:31:06.900
 the yellow line on the road.

4:31:06.900 --> 4:31:09.700
 And so for me with the cacao, part of when I do

4:31:09.700 --> 4:31:12.060
 these ceremonies is just to say like,

4:31:12.060 --> 4:31:15.220
 you're drinking this cacao, but there's a person

4:31:15.220 --> 4:31:16.860
 who planted the seed, there's a person

4:31:16.860 --> 4:31:19.020
 who watered the plant, there's a person,

4:31:19.020 --> 4:31:22.420
 and I just think that level of awareness,

4:31:22.420 --> 4:31:24.260
 and it's true with anything.

4:31:24.260 --> 4:31:27.980
 Like you have in front of you a stuffed hedgehog, so.

4:31:27.980 --> 4:31:28.860
 Somebody made that.

4:31:28.860 --> 4:31:30.220
 I love it, it's great.

4:31:30.220 --> 4:31:32.140
 But like, if we just said, all right,

4:31:32.140 --> 4:31:35.200
 where does this stuffed hedgehog come from?

4:31:35.200 --> 4:31:38.980
 We would have a full story of globalization,

4:31:38.980 --> 4:31:42.120
 of the interconnection of people all around the world

4:31:42.120 --> 4:31:45.140
 doing all sorts of things of human imagination.

4:31:45.140 --> 4:31:47.380
 It's beyond our capacity and our daily,

4:31:47.380 --> 4:31:49.580
 we'd go insane if every day,

4:31:49.580 --> 4:31:51.260
 like we're speaking into a microphone,

4:31:51.260 --> 4:31:54.540
 well, what are the hundreds of years of technology

4:31:54.540 --> 4:31:56.060
 that make this possible?

4:31:56.060 --> 4:31:59.140
 But if just once in a while, we just focus on one thing

4:31:59.140 --> 4:32:01.940
 and say, this thing is sacred.

4:32:01.940 --> 4:32:04.100
 And because I'm recognizing that

4:32:04.100 --> 4:32:07.020
 and I'm having an appreciation for the world around me,

4:32:07.020 --> 4:32:10.420
 it just kind of makes my life feel more sacred.

4:32:10.420 --> 4:32:12.480
 It makes me recognize my connection to others.

4:32:12.480 --> 4:32:14.700
 So that's the gist of it.

4:32:14.700 --> 4:32:16.920
 Yeah, it's funny, I often look at

4:32:19.660 --> 4:32:23.540
 things in this world and moments and just am in awe

4:32:24.800 --> 4:32:27.700
 of the full

4:32:27.700 --> 4:32:32.700
 universe that brought that to be.

4:32:33.780 --> 4:32:35.620
 In a similar way as you're saying,

4:32:35.620 --> 4:32:38.940
 but I don't as often think about exactly what you're saying,

4:32:38.940 --> 4:32:41.580
 which is the number of people behind every little thing

4:32:41.580 --> 4:32:43.060
 we get to enjoy.

4:32:43.060 --> 4:32:45.620
 I mean, yeah, this hedgehog, this microphone,

4:32:46.540 --> 4:32:49.600
 like directly, like thousands of people involved.

4:32:49.600 --> 4:32:50.440
 Millions.

4:32:50.440 --> 4:32:52.140
 And then indirectly, it's millions.

4:32:52.140 --> 4:32:57.140
 Like, and they're all like this microphone

4:32:59.260 --> 4:33:01.820
 that there's like artists, essentially,

4:33:01.820 --> 4:33:04.100
 like people who made it their life's work,

4:33:04.100 --> 4:33:07.420
 all the costs, like from the factories to the manufacturer,

4:33:07.420 --> 4:33:11.620
 there's families that the production of this microphone

4:33:11.620 --> 4:33:14.860
 and this hedgehog are fed because of the skill

4:33:14.860 --> 4:33:18.780
 of this human that helped contribute to that development.

4:33:18.780 --> 4:33:20.060
 Yeah, it's.

4:33:20.060 --> 4:33:22.420
 And like Isaac Newton and John von Neumann

4:33:22.420 --> 4:33:24.420
 are in this microphone.

4:33:24.420 --> 4:33:26.180
 They're standing on the shoulders of giants

4:33:26.180 --> 4:33:28.600
 and we're standing on their shoulders.

4:33:28.600 --> 4:33:31.380
 And somebody will be standing on ours.

4:33:34.100 --> 4:33:39.100
 You mentioned One Shared World, what is it?

4:33:40.000 --> 4:33:41.060
 Well, thanks for asking.

4:33:41.060 --> 4:33:42.980
 And by the way, what I will say is the people

4:33:42.980 --> 4:33:46.220
 who are listening, this is so incredible

4:33:46.220 --> 4:33:49.540
 and I'm so thrilled to have this kind of long conversation.

4:33:49.540 --> 4:33:54.260
 Hello, person who's listening past the five hour mark.

4:33:54.260 --> 4:33:55.160
 Thanks, mom.

4:33:56.840 --> 4:33:58.200
 I salute you.

4:33:58.200 --> 4:34:00.780
 Somebody was like sleeping for the first four hours

4:34:00.780 --> 4:34:01.740
 and just woke up.

4:34:01.740 --> 4:34:04.700
 Now's the good stuff, I've been saving it.

4:34:04.700 --> 4:34:09.220
 But, and I have to say that so much of our lives

4:34:09.220 --> 4:34:11.220
 is forced into these short bursts

4:34:11.220 --> 4:34:14.180
 that I'm just so appreciative to have the chance

4:34:14.180 --> 4:34:15.740
 to have this conversation.

4:34:15.740 --> 4:34:16.580
 So thank you for that.

4:34:16.580 --> 4:34:18.700
 Some people would say five hours is short, so.

4:34:18.700 --> 4:34:20.740
 You know, let's go.

4:34:20.740 --> 4:34:25.740
 And yeah, that's what my girlfriend says.

4:34:25.780 --> 4:34:29.260
 Like if I was like captured and tortured

4:34:29.260 --> 4:34:30.820
 and they were gonna interrogate me,

4:34:30.820 --> 4:34:32.700
 it's like at the end they'd say, all right.

4:34:32.700 --> 4:34:35.500
 No, we're sick of this guy, we quit.

4:34:35.500 --> 4:34:36.340
 Let him go.

4:34:36.340 --> 4:34:37.300
 I love it.

4:34:37.300 --> 4:34:39.940
 So background on One Shared World.

4:34:39.940 --> 4:34:43.140
 I mentioned I'm on a faculty for Singularity University.

4:34:43.140 --> 4:34:45.300
 In the earliest days of the pandemic,

4:34:45.300 --> 4:34:48.580
 I was invited to give a talk on whether the tools

4:34:48.580 --> 4:34:50.340
 of the genetics and biotech revolutions

4:34:50.340 --> 4:34:52.820
 were a match for the outbreak.

4:34:52.820 --> 4:34:55.100
 And my view was then as now

4:34:55.100 --> 4:34:57.460
 that the answer to that question is yes.

4:34:57.460 --> 4:34:58.940
 But I woke up that morning

4:34:58.940 --> 4:35:02.700
 and I felt that that wasn't the most important talk

4:35:02.700 --> 4:35:03.540
 that I could give.

4:35:03.540 --> 4:35:06.060
 There was something else that was more pressing for me.

4:35:06.060 --> 4:35:08.220
 And that was the realization,

4:35:08.220 --> 4:35:09.100
 they were asking the question,

4:35:09.100 --> 4:35:12.020
 well, why weren't we prepared for this pandemic?

4:35:12.020 --> 4:35:14.420
 Because we could have been, we weren't.

4:35:14.420 --> 4:35:17.020
 And why can't, and because of that,

4:35:17.020 --> 4:35:21.860
 why can't we respond adequately to this outbreak?

4:35:23.020 --> 4:35:24.580
 And then there was the thing, well,

4:35:24.580 --> 4:35:27.740
 if we, even if we respond somehow miraculously

4:35:27.740 --> 4:35:31.460
 overcome this pandemic, it's a pyrrhic victory

4:35:31.460 --> 4:35:35.540
 if we don't prepare ourselves to respond

4:35:35.540 --> 4:35:37.580
 to the broader category of pandemics,

4:35:37.580 --> 4:35:40.700
 particularly as we enter the age of synthetic biology.

4:35:40.700 --> 4:35:44.900
 But if somehow miraculously we solve that problem,

4:35:44.900 --> 4:35:47.380
 but we don't solve the problem of climate change,

4:35:47.380 --> 4:35:48.220
 well, kind of who cares?

4:35:48.220 --> 4:35:49.220
 We didn't have a pandemic,

4:35:49.220 --> 4:35:51.500
 but we wiped everybody out from climate change.

4:35:51.500 --> 4:35:55.020
 And let's just say, you get where this is going,

4:35:55.020 --> 4:35:58.660
 that we organize ourselves and we solve climate change.

4:35:58.660 --> 4:36:00.620
 And then we have a nuclear war

4:36:00.620 --> 4:36:03.060
 because everybody's, particularly China now,

4:36:03.060 --> 4:36:05.180
 but US, the former Soviet Union

4:36:05.180 --> 4:36:07.100
 are building all these nuclear weapons.

4:36:07.100 --> 4:36:09.060
 Who cares that we solved climate change

4:36:09.060 --> 4:36:10.460
 because we're all gone anyway.

4:36:10.460 --> 4:36:14.900
 And the meta category, bringing all of those things together

4:36:14.900 --> 4:36:19.700
 was this mismatch between the increasingly global

4:36:19.700 --> 4:36:24.020
 and shared nature of the biggest challenges that we face

4:36:24.020 --> 4:36:29.020
 and our inability to solve that entire category of problems.

4:36:29.420 --> 4:36:32.220
 And there's a historical issue,

4:36:32.220 --> 4:36:36.500
 which is that prior to the 30 Years War in the 17th century,

4:36:36.500 --> 4:36:38.900
 we had all these different kinds of sovereignty

4:36:38.900 --> 4:36:41.100
 and religious and different kinds

4:36:41.100 --> 4:36:44.100
 of organizational principles and everybody got in this war.

4:36:44.100 --> 4:36:46.780
 And in this series of treaties

4:36:46.780 --> 4:36:50.420
 that together are called the Peace of Westphalia,

4:36:50.420 --> 4:36:52.980
 the framework for the modern,

4:36:52.980 --> 4:36:55.780
 what we now understand as the modern nation state was laid.

4:36:55.780 --> 4:36:58.540
 And then through colonialism and other means

4:36:58.540 --> 4:37:03.180
 that idea of a state is what it is today,

4:37:03.180 --> 4:37:05.980
 spread throughout the world.

4:37:05.980 --> 4:37:09.580
 Then through particularly the late 19th

4:37:09.580 --> 4:37:10.980
 and early 20th century,

4:37:10.980 --> 4:37:14.140
 we realized how unstable that system was

4:37:14.140 --> 4:37:16.420
 because you always had these jockeying

4:37:16.420 --> 4:37:18.300
 between sovereign states and some were rising

4:37:18.300 --> 4:37:21.020
 and some were falling and you ended up in war.

4:37:21.020 --> 4:37:23.380
 And that was the genius of the generations

4:37:23.380 --> 4:37:25.900
 who came together in 1945 in San Francisco

4:37:25.900 --> 4:37:28.220
 and the planning had even started before then,

4:37:28.220 --> 4:37:30.900
 who said, well, we can't just have that world,

4:37:30.900 --> 4:37:32.580
 we need to have an overlay.

4:37:32.580 --> 4:37:34.900
 And we talked about the UN and the WHO

4:37:34.900 --> 4:37:39.780
 of systems which transcend our national sovereignties.

4:37:39.780 --> 4:37:42.220
 They don't get rid of them, but they transcend them

4:37:42.220 --> 4:37:44.660
 so we can solve this category of problems.

4:37:44.660 --> 4:37:47.740
 But we're now reaching a point where our reach as humans,

4:37:47.740 --> 4:37:51.020
 even individually, but collectively is so great

4:37:51.020 --> 4:37:52.540
 that there's a mismatch between, as I said,

4:37:52.540 --> 4:37:53.820
 the nature of the problems

4:37:53.820 --> 4:37:57.980
 and the ability to solve those problems.

4:37:57.980 --> 4:38:00.180
 And unless we can address

4:38:00.180 --> 4:38:03.820
 that broader global collective action problem,

4:38:03.820 --> 4:38:05.340
 we're going to extinct ourselves.

4:38:05.340 --> 4:38:08.180
 And we see these different, what I call verticals,

4:38:08.180 --> 4:38:09.500
 whether it's climate change

4:38:09.500 --> 4:38:13.100
 or trying to prevent a nuclear weapons proliferation

4:38:13.100 --> 4:38:16.260
 or anything else, but none of those can succeed.

4:38:16.260 --> 4:38:18.940
 And frankly, it doesn't even matter if one succeeds

4:38:18.940 --> 4:38:21.660
 because all of them have the potential

4:38:21.660 --> 4:38:24.420
 to lead to extinction level events.

4:38:25.340 --> 4:38:30.020
 So I gave that talk and that talk went viral.

4:38:30.020 --> 4:38:32.940
 I stayed up all night the next night and I drafted,

4:38:32.940 --> 4:38:35.140
 I think it was like an insanity,

4:38:35.140 --> 4:38:36.860
 but I think a lot of us were manic

4:38:36.860 --> 4:38:38.900
 in those early days of the pandemics

4:38:38.900 --> 4:38:40.180
 wanting to do something.

4:38:40.180 --> 4:38:42.220
 And so I stayed up all night and I drafted

4:38:42.220 --> 4:38:45.460
 what I called a declaration of global interdependence.

4:38:45.460 --> 4:38:48.620
 And I posted that on my website, my jamiemuscle.com.

4:38:48.620 --> 4:38:49.620
 It's still there.

4:38:49.620 --> 4:38:51.780
 And that went viral.

4:38:51.780 --> 4:38:54.140
 And so then I called a meeting just on the people

4:38:54.140 --> 4:38:56.300
 on my personal email list.

4:38:56.300 --> 4:38:59.620
 And so we had people from 25 countries.

4:38:59.620 --> 4:39:00.900
 There were all of these people

4:39:00.900 --> 4:39:02.500
 who were having the same thing.

4:39:02.500 --> 4:39:03.940
 There's something wrong in the world.

4:39:03.940 --> 4:39:07.700
 They wanted to be part of a process of fixing it.

4:39:07.700 --> 4:39:10.500
 And so it was a crazy 35 days

4:39:10.500 --> 4:39:12.940
 where we broke into eight different working groups.

4:39:12.940 --> 4:39:16.060
 We had an amazing team that helped redraft

4:39:16.060 --> 4:39:18.740
 what became the declaration of interdependence,

4:39:18.740 --> 4:39:21.460
 which is now in 20 languages.

4:39:21.460 --> 4:39:23.380
 We laid out a work plan.

4:39:23.380 --> 4:39:27.020
 We founded this organization called One Shared World.

4:39:27.020 --> 4:39:28.940
 The URL is oneshared.world.

4:39:28.940 --> 4:39:31.500
 And it's just been this incredible journey.

4:39:31.500 --> 4:39:33.100
 We now have people who are participating

4:39:33.100 --> 4:39:36.940
 in one way or another from 120 different countries.

4:39:36.940 --> 4:39:40.340
 We have our public events exploring these issues,

4:39:40.340 --> 4:39:43.020
 get millions of viewers.

4:39:43.020 --> 4:39:46.660
 We have world leaders who are participating.

4:39:46.660 --> 4:39:51.260
 So the vision is to work on some of these big problems,

4:39:51.260 --> 4:39:53.500
 arbitrary number of problems that present themselves

4:39:53.500 --> 4:39:56.420
 in the world that face all of human civilization

4:39:56.420 --> 4:39:58.100
 and to be able to work together.

4:39:58.100 --> 4:40:02.180
 Well, that is, but there's a macro, a meta problem,

4:40:02.180 --> 4:40:04.580
 which is the global collective action problem.

4:40:04.580 --> 4:40:09.580
 And so the idea is even if we just focus on the verticals,

4:40:10.020 --> 4:40:12.500
 on the manifestations of the global collective action

4:40:12.500 --> 4:40:16.460
 problem, there'll be an infinite number of those things.

4:40:16.460 --> 4:40:18.860
 So while we work on those things,

4:40:18.860 --> 4:40:22.700
 like climate change, pandemics, WMD and other things,

4:40:22.700 --> 4:40:25.220
 we also have to ask the bigger questions

4:40:25.220 --> 4:40:27.380
 of why can't we solve this category of problems.

4:40:27.380 --> 4:40:30.100
 And the idea is, at least from my observation,

4:40:30.100 --> 4:40:34.980
 is that whenever big decisions are being made,

4:40:34.980 --> 4:40:37.620
 our national leaders and corporate leaders

4:40:37.620 --> 4:40:40.460
 are doing exactly what we've hired them to do.

4:40:40.460 --> 4:40:43.620
 They're maximizing for national interest,

4:40:43.620 --> 4:40:45.020
 even, or corporate interests,

4:40:45.020 --> 4:40:48.460
 even at the expense of everybody.

4:40:48.460 --> 4:40:50.420
 And so it's not that we wanna get rid of states.

4:40:50.420 --> 4:40:52.660
 States are essential in our world system.

4:40:52.660 --> 4:40:54.300
 It's not we wanna undermine the UN,

4:40:54.300 --> 4:40:57.860
 which is also essential, but massively underperforming.

4:40:57.860 --> 4:40:59.260
 What we wanna do is to create

4:40:59.260 --> 4:41:02.300
 an empowered global constituency of people

4:41:02.300 --> 4:41:06.180
 who are demanding that their leaders at all levels

4:41:06.180 --> 4:41:09.060
 just do a better job of balancing

4:41:09.060 --> 4:41:10.540
 broader and narrower interests.

4:41:10.540 --> 4:41:11.380
 I see.

4:41:11.380 --> 4:41:13.500
 So this is more like a,

4:41:14.740 --> 4:41:17.780
 make it more symmetric in terms of power.

4:41:17.780 --> 4:41:22.780
 It's holding accountable the nations, the leaders.

4:41:22.780 --> 4:41:23.940
 The leaders.

4:41:23.940 --> 4:41:26.900
 The problem is nations are powerful.

4:41:26.900 --> 4:41:29.260
 We talked about China quite a bit.

4:41:29.260 --> 4:41:33.940
 How do you have an organizations of citizens of Earth

4:41:33.940 --> 4:41:36.860
 that can solve this collective problem

4:41:36.860 --> 4:41:39.180
 that holds China accountable?

4:41:39.180 --> 4:41:41.540
 It's difficult, because UN,

4:41:41.540 --> 4:41:42.740
 you could say a lot of things,

4:41:42.740 --> 4:41:45.540
 but to call it effective is hard.

4:41:45.540 --> 4:41:50.300
 You know, the internet almost is a kind of representation

4:41:50.300 --> 4:41:55.300
 of a collective force that holds nations accountable.

4:41:57.260 --> 4:41:58.780
 Not to give Twitter too much credit,

4:41:58.780 --> 4:42:01.420
 but social networks, broadly speaking.

4:42:03.380 --> 4:42:05.260
 So you have hope that it's possible

4:42:05.260 --> 4:42:10.260
 to build such collections of humans that resist China.

4:42:10.700 --> 4:42:12.740
 Not necessarily resist China,

4:42:12.740 --> 4:42:16.900
 but human, I mean, our cultures change over time.

4:42:16.900 --> 4:42:20.060
 I mean, the idea of the modern nation state

4:42:20.060 --> 4:42:22.460
 would not have made sense to people

4:42:22.460 --> 4:42:24.500
 in the 13th or 14th century.

4:42:24.500 --> 4:42:28.260
 The idea that became the United Nations.

4:42:28.260 --> 4:42:33.260
 I mean, it had its earliest days in the philosophies of Kant.

4:42:33.540 --> 4:42:38.540
 It took a long time for these ideas to be realized.

4:42:39.820 --> 4:42:44.420
 And so the idea, and we're far from successful.

4:42:44.420 --> 4:42:46.940
 I mean, we've had little minor successes,

4:42:46.940 --> 4:42:47.820
 which we're very proud of.

4:42:47.820 --> 4:42:51.180
 We got the G20 leaders to incorporate the language

4:42:51.180 --> 4:42:53.580
 that we provided on addressing the needs

4:42:53.580 --> 4:42:56.140
 of the world's most vulnerable populations

4:42:56.140 --> 4:42:59.620
 into the final summit communique

4:42:59.620 --> 4:43:01.740
 from the G20 summit in Riyadh.

4:43:01.740 --> 4:43:03.700
 This year, we're just on the verge

4:43:03.700 --> 4:43:07.220
 of having our language pat on the same issue,

4:43:07.220 --> 4:43:10.100
 ensuring everyone on earth has access to safe water,

4:43:10.100 --> 4:43:11.500
 basic sanitation and hygiene,

4:43:11.500 --> 4:43:14.580
 and essential pandemic protection by 2030

4:43:14.580 --> 4:43:18.380
 passed as part of a resolution in the United Nations

4:43:18.380 --> 4:43:19.220
 General Assembly.

4:43:19.220 --> 4:43:22.100
 And we're primarily, I mean, it's young people

4:43:22.100 --> 4:43:23.540
 all around the world.

4:43:23.540 --> 4:43:26.060
 And when I told them in the beginning of this year,

4:43:26.060 --> 4:43:26.900
 this is our goal.

4:43:26.900 --> 4:43:28.980
 We're gonna get the UN General Assembly

4:43:28.980 --> 4:43:32.300
 to pass a resolution with our language in it.

4:43:32.300 --> 4:43:35.020
 I mean, first, I think they all thought it was insane,

4:43:35.020 --> 4:43:38.180
 but they were too young and inexperienced

4:43:38.180 --> 4:43:39.860
 to know how insane it was.

4:43:39.860 --> 4:43:42.140
 But now these young people are just so excited

4:43:42.140 --> 4:43:43.740
 that it's actually happening.

4:43:43.740 --> 4:43:48.740
 So what we're trying to do is really to create a movement,

4:43:48.860 --> 4:43:51.580
 which we don't feel that we need to do from scratch

4:43:51.580 --> 4:43:53.100
 because there are a lot of movements.

4:43:53.100 --> 4:43:56.660
 Like right now, we just had the Glasgow G20,

4:43:56.660 --> 4:44:00.380
 I mean, I'm sorry, the Glasgow Climate Change Cup 26,

4:44:00.380 --> 4:44:03.060
 and then Greta Thunberg, who has a huge following

4:44:03.060 --> 4:44:05.780
 and who is an amazing young woman,

4:44:05.780 --> 4:44:08.940
 but I was kind of disappointed in what she said afterwards.

4:44:08.940 --> 4:44:13.060
 It became like a meme on Twitter, which was blah, blah, blah.

4:44:13.060 --> 4:44:15.100
 And basically it was like, blah, blah, blah,

4:44:15.100 --> 4:44:17.500
 these old people are just screwing around

4:44:17.500 --> 4:44:18.860
 and it's a waste of time.

4:44:18.860 --> 4:44:22.300
 And definitely the critique is merited,

4:44:22.300 --> 4:44:25.660
 but young people have never been more empowered,

4:44:25.660 --> 4:44:29.260
 educated, connected than they are now.

4:44:29.260 --> 4:44:34.260
 And so we've had a process with One Shared World

4:44:36.180 --> 4:44:39.660
 where we partnered with the Model United Nations,

4:44:39.660 --> 4:44:42.260
 the Aga Khan Foundation, the India Sanitation Coalition.

4:44:42.260 --> 4:44:44.460
 And what we did is say, all right, we have this goal,

4:44:44.460 --> 4:44:46.980
 water sanitation, hygiene, and pandemic protection

4:44:46.980 --> 4:44:49.420
 for everyone on earth by 2030.

4:44:49.420 --> 4:44:52.100
 And we had debates and consultations

4:44:52.100 --> 4:44:54.980
 using the Model UN framework all around the world

4:44:54.980 --> 4:44:56.860
 in multiple languages.

4:44:56.860 --> 4:44:58.420
 And we said, come up with a plan

4:44:58.420 --> 4:44:59.620
 for how this could be achieved.

4:44:59.620 --> 4:45:02.660
 And these brilliant young people in every country,

4:45:02.660 --> 4:45:04.820
 not every country, most countries,

4:45:04.820 --> 4:45:06.940
 they all contributed, then we had a plan.

4:45:06.940 --> 4:45:08.980
 Then I recruited friends of mine,

4:45:08.980 --> 4:45:11.260
 like my friend Hans Carrell in Sweden,

4:45:11.260 --> 4:45:14.900
 who's the former chief counsel of the whole United Nations,

4:45:14.900 --> 4:45:18.420
 and asked him and others to work with these young people

4:45:18.420 --> 4:45:20.820
 and representatives to turn that

4:45:20.820 --> 4:45:24.780
 into what looks exactly like a UN resolution.

4:45:24.780 --> 4:45:28.380
 It's just written by a bunch of kids all around the world.

4:45:28.380 --> 4:45:31.660
 We then sent that to every permanent representative,

4:45:31.660 --> 4:45:34.260
 every government representative at the UN.

4:45:34.260 --> 4:45:35.580
 And that was why working

4:45:35.580 --> 4:45:37.180
 with the German and Spanish governments,

4:45:37.180 --> 4:45:40.060
 why the language is centralized from that document

4:45:40.060 --> 4:45:41.900
 is about to pass the UN.

4:45:41.900 --> 4:45:43.460
 And it doesn't mean that just passing

4:45:43.460 --> 4:45:46.540
 a UN General Assembly resolution changes anything,

4:45:46.540 --> 4:45:49.860
 but we think that there's a model of engaging people,

4:45:49.860 --> 4:45:50.820
 just like you're talking about,

4:45:50.820 --> 4:45:53.100
 these people who are outside

4:45:53.100 --> 4:45:55.380
 of the traditional power structures

4:45:55.380 --> 4:45:57.940
 and who want to have a voice.

4:45:57.940 --> 4:46:00.020
 But I think we need to give a little bit of structure

4:46:00.020 --> 4:46:03.860
 because just going, I'm a big fan of Global Citizen,

4:46:03.860 --> 4:46:06.740
 but just going to a Global Citizen concert

4:46:06.740 --> 4:46:09.020
 and waving your iPhone back and forth

4:46:09.020 --> 4:46:11.660
 and tweeting about it isn't enough

4:46:11.660 --> 4:46:14.300
 to drive the kind of change that's required.

4:46:14.300 --> 4:46:17.860
 We need to come together, even in untraditional ways,

4:46:17.860 --> 4:46:20.020
 and articulate the change we want

4:46:20.020 --> 4:46:22.900
 and build popular movements to make that happen.

4:46:22.900 --> 4:46:26.500
 And popular means scale and movements at scale

4:46:26.500 --> 4:46:30.420
 that actually, at the individual level, do something

4:46:30.420 --> 4:46:33.380
 and that's then magnified with the scale

4:46:33.380 --> 4:46:35.300
 to actually have significant impact.

4:46:35.300 --> 4:46:39.700
 I mean, at its best, you hear a lot of folks talk

4:46:39.700 --> 4:46:44.500
 about the various cryptocurrencies as possibly helping.

4:46:44.500 --> 4:46:46.980
 You have young people get involved

4:46:46.980 --> 4:46:49.380
 in challenging the power structures

4:46:49.380 --> 4:46:51.220
 by challenging the monetary system.

4:46:51.220 --> 4:46:56.220
 And there's, some of it is number go up,

4:46:56.580 --> 4:47:00.940
 people get excited when they can make a little bit of money,

4:47:00.940 --> 4:47:04.820
 but that's actually almost like an entry point

4:47:04.820 --> 4:47:07.660
 because then you almost feel empowered.

4:47:07.660 --> 4:47:10.180
 And because of that, you start to think

4:47:10.180 --> 4:47:11.980
 about some of these philosophical ideas

4:47:11.980 --> 4:47:15.220
 that I, as a young person, have the power

4:47:15.220 --> 4:47:16.740
 to change the world.

4:47:16.740 --> 4:47:20.780
 All of these senior folks in the position of power,

4:47:20.780 --> 4:47:24.220
 they were, first of all, they were once young

4:47:24.220 --> 4:47:26.220
 and powerless like me.

4:47:26.220 --> 4:47:29.420
 And I could be part of the next generation

4:47:29.420 --> 4:47:30.260
 that makes a change.

4:47:30.260 --> 4:47:32.060
 Well, all the things I see that are wrong

4:47:32.060 --> 4:47:34.620
 with the world, I can make it better.

4:47:34.620 --> 4:47:39.620
 And it's very true that the overly powerful nations

4:47:39.980 --> 4:47:43.380
 of the world could be a relic of the past.

4:47:43.380 --> 4:47:47.940
 That could be a 20th century and before idea

4:47:47.940 --> 4:47:52.580
 that was tried, created a lot of benefit,

4:47:52.580 --> 4:47:56.580
 but we also saw the problems with that kind of world,

4:47:56.580 --> 4:47:58.060
 extreme nationalism.

4:47:58.980 --> 4:48:02.660
 We see the benefits and the problems of the Cold War.

4:48:02.660 --> 4:48:04.860
 Arguably Cold War got us to the moon,

4:48:06.460 --> 4:48:08.580
 but there could be other, a lot of other different

4:48:08.580 --> 4:48:11.220
 mechanisms that inspired competition,

4:48:11.220 --> 4:48:13.860
 especially friendly competition between nations

4:48:13.860 --> 4:48:16.420
 versus adversarial competition that resulted

4:48:16.420 --> 4:48:18.140
 in the response to COVID, for example,

4:48:18.140 --> 4:48:20.540
 with China and the United States and Russia

4:48:20.540 --> 4:48:23.660
 and the secrecy, the censorship.

4:48:25.900 --> 4:48:27.700
 Yeah, and all the things that are basically

4:48:27.700 --> 4:48:31.420
 against the spirit of science

4:48:31.420 --> 4:48:34.100
 and resulted in the loss of trillions of dollars

4:48:34.100 --> 4:48:37.620
 and the cost of countless lives.

4:48:37.620 --> 4:48:41.540
 What gives you hope about the future, Jamie?

4:48:41.540 --> 4:48:45.060
 Well, one of the things, you mentioned cryptocurrency

4:48:45.060 --> 4:48:47.900
 and then as you know better than most,

4:48:47.900 --> 4:48:50.300
 there's cryptocurrency and then underneath

4:48:50.300 --> 4:48:52.260
 the cryptocurrency, there's the blockchain

4:48:52.260 --> 4:48:54.100
 and the distributed ledger.

4:48:54.100 --> 4:48:56.380
 And then like we talked about, there are all these

4:48:56.380 --> 4:49:00.100
 young people who are able to connect with each other,

4:49:00.100 --> 4:49:03.220
 to organize in new ways.

4:49:03.220 --> 4:49:07.100
 And I work with these young people every single day

4:49:07.100 --> 4:49:09.460
 through One Shared World primarily,

4:49:09.460 --> 4:49:11.220
 but also other things.

4:49:11.220 --> 4:49:13.180
 And there's so much optimism.

4:49:13.180 --> 4:49:18.180
 There's so much hope that I just have a lot of faith

4:49:18.900 --> 4:49:20.620
 that we're gonna figure something out.

4:49:20.620 --> 4:49:23.940
 I'm an optimist by nature.

4:49:23.940 --> 4:49:26.700
 And that doesn't mean that we need to be blind

4:49:26.700 --> 4:49:27.540
 to the dangers.

4:49:27.540 --> 4:49:30.420
 There are very, very real dangers,

4:49:30.420 --> 4:49:34.740
 but just given half the chance, people wanna be good.

4:49:34.740 --> 4:49:37.180
 People want to do the right thing.

4:49:37.180 --> 4:49:40.060
 And I do believe that there's a role,

4:49:40.060 --> 4:49:42.940
 maybe there's a role for the at least near term

4:49:42.940 --> 4:49:46.780
 for governments, but there's always a role for leadership.

4:49:46.780 --> 4:49:50.500
 And I'm, I guess like a Gramscian in the sense

4:49:50.500 --> 4:49:53.980
 that I think that we need to create frameworks

4:49:53.980 --> 4:49:58.620
 and structures that allow leaders to emerge.

4:49:58.620 --> 4:50:02.940
 And we need to build norms so that the leaders who emerge

4:50:02.940 --> 4:50:07.940
 are leaders who call on us, inspire our best instincts

4:50:08.180 --> 4:50:10.900
 and not drive us toward our worst.

4:50:10.900 --> 4:50:13.740
 But I really see a lot of hope.

4:50:13.740 --> 4:50:18.740
 And when you say this all the time in your podcast,

4:50:19.460 --> 4:50:21.780
 and you may even be more optimistic to me

4:50:21.780 --> 4:50:24.820
 as you look at the darkest moments of human history

4:50:24.820 --> 4:50:29.740
 and see hope, but we're kind of a crazy, wonderful species.

4:50:29.740 --> 4:50:32.500
 I mean, yes, we figured out ways to slaughter each other

4:50:32.500 --> 4:50:36.100
 at scale, but we've come up with these wonderful philosophies

4:50:36.100 --> 4:50:38.580
 about love and all of those things.

4:50:38.580 --> 4:50:41.980
 And yeah, maybe the Bonobos have some love

4:50:41.980 --> 4:50:43.940
 in their cultures, but this,

4:50:43.940 --> 4:50:46.180
 we're kind of a wonderful magical species.

4:50:46.180 --> 4:50:49.980
 And if we just can create enough of an infrastructure,

4:50:49.980 --> 4:50:52.100
 doesn't need to be and shouldn't be controlling,

4:50:52.100 --> 4:50:54.100
 just enough of an infrastructure

4:50:54.100 --> 4:50:56.500
 so that people are stakeholders,

4:50:56.500 --> 4:50:57.740
 feel like they're stakeholders

4:50:57.740 --> 4:51:00.340
 in contributing to a positive story,

4:51:00.340 --> 4:51:04.500
 I just really feel the sky is the limit.

4:51:04.500 --> 4:51:06.900
 So if there's somebody who's young right now,

4:51:06.900 --> 4:51:08.740
 somebody in high school, somebody in college

4:51:08.740 --> 4:51:12.380
 listening to you, you've done a lot of incredible things.

4:51:12.380 --> 4:51:17.380
 You're respected by a lot of the elites.

4:51:17.380 --> 4:51:20.860
 You're respected by the people.

4:51:20.860 --> 4:51:25.860
 So you're both able to sort of speak to all groups,

4:51:26.820 --> 4:51:29.860
 walk through the fire, like you mentioned

4:51:29.860 --> 4:51:31.380
 with the slab leak.

4:51:32.460 --> 4:51:36.740
 What advice would you give to young kids today

4:51:36.740 --> 4:51:38.540
 that are inspired by your story?

4:51:38.540 --> 4:51:39.660
 Well, thank you.

4:51:39.660 --> 4:51:41.780
 I mean, I think there's one, there's lots of,

4:51:41.780 --> 4:51:44.300
 I'm honored if anybody is inspired,

4:51:44.300 --> 4:51:48.300
 but it's the same thing as I said with the science

4:51:48.300 --> 4:51:50.020
 that it's all about values.

4:51:50.020 --> 4:51:54.020
 The core of everything is knowing who you are.

4:51:54.020 --> 4:51:56.460
 And so yes, I mean, there's the broader thing

4:51:56.460 --> 4:52:01.460
 of follow your passions, a creative mind

4:52:01.460 --> 4:52:03.820
 and an inquisitive mind is the core of everything

4:52:03.820 --> 4:52:06.540
 because the knowledge base is constantly sharing.

4:52:06.540 --> 4:52:09.020
 So learning how to learn,

4:52:09.020 --> 4:52:13.020
 but at the core of everything is investing

4:52:13.020 --> 4:52:16.500
 in knowing who you are and what you stand for.

4:52:16.500 --> 4:52:21.500
 Because that's the way, that's the path

4:52:21.500 --> 4:52:24.460
 to leading a meaningful life, to contributing,

4:52:24.460 --> 4:52:28.820
 to not feeling alienated from your life as you get older.

4:52:28.820 --> 4:52:33.820
 And just like you live, it's an ongoing process

4:52:34.180 --> 4:52:35.740
 and we all make mistakes

4:52:35.740 --> 4:52:38.700
 and we all kind of travel down wrong paths

4:52:38.700 --> 4:52:41.420
 and just have some love for yourself

4:52:41.420 --> 4:52:44.300
 and recognize that just at every,

4:52:44.300 --> 4:52:46.500
 like I was saying with the Ironman,

4:52:46.500 --> 4:52:50.260
 just when you think there's no possibility

4:52:50.260 --> 4:52:54.540
 that you can go on, there's a 100% possibility

4:52:54.540 --> 4:52:55.460
 that you can go on.

4:52:55.460 --> 4:52:58.060
 And just when you think that nothing better

4:52:58.060 --> 4:53:02.020
 will happen to you, there's a 100% chance

4:53:02.020 --> 4:53:03.660
 that something better will happen to you.

4:53:03.660 --> 4:53:05.700
 You just gotta keep going.

4:53:05.700 --> 4:53:08.740
 Jamie, I've been a fan of yours.

4:53:08.740 --> 4:53:11.980
 I think first heard you on Joe Rogan Experience,

4:53:11.980 --> 4:53:13.860
 but I've been following your work,

4:53:13.860 --> 4:53:18.580
 your bold, fearless work with speaking about the lab leak

4:53:18.580 --> 4:53:20.420
 and everything you represent

4:53:20.420 --> 4:53:23.020
 from your brilliance to your kindness.

4:53:23.020 --> 4:53:27.140
 And the fact that you spent your valuable time with me today

4:53:27.140 --> 4:53:31.620
 and now I officially made you miss your flight.

4:53:31.620 --> 4:53:34.220
 And the fact that you said that

4:53:34.220 --> 4:53:35.740
 whether you were being nice or not,

4:53:35.740 --> 4:53:38.260
 I don't know that you will be okay with that

4:53:38.260 --> 4:53:39.420
 means the world to me.

4:53:39.420 --> 4:53:42.180
 And I'm really honored that you spent your time with me today.

4:53:42.180 --> 4:53:44.980
 Well, really, it's been such a great pleasure

4:53:44.980 --> 4:53:48.100
 and thank you for creating a forum

4:53:48.100 --> 4:53:51.020
 to have these kinds of long conversations.

4:53:51.020 --> 4:53:53.860
 So I really enjoyed it and thank you.

4:53:53.860 --> 4:53:58.340
 And if anybody has now listened for,

4:53:58.340 --> 4:53:59.900
 what's it been, five and a half hours?

4:53:59.900 --> 4:54:00.740
 Yep.

4:54:00.740 --> 4:54:01.820
 Thank you for listening.

4:54:01.820 --> 4:54:03.940
 Welcome to Five Hour Club.

4:54:03.940 --> 4:54:04.780
 Represent.

4:54:04.780 --> 4:54:06.340
 Exactly.

4:54:06.340 --> 4:54:07.180
 Thank you, Jamie.

4:54:07.180 --> 4:54:09.100
 Thanks, Lex.

4:54:09.100 --> 4:54:10.620
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

4:54:10.620 --> 4:54:11.900
 with Jamie Metzl.

4:54:11.900 --> 4:54:13.220
 To support this podcast,

4:54:13.220 --> 4:54:16.100
 please check out our sponsors in the description.

4:54:16.100 --> 4:54:19.580
 And now let me leave you some words from Richard Feynman

4:54:19.580 --> 4:54:21.660
 about science and religion,

4:54:21.660 --> 4:54:24.860
 which I think also applies to science and geopolitics

4:54:24.860 --> 4:54:27.340
 because I believe scientists have the responsibility

4:54:27.340 --> 4:54:29.220
 to think broadly about the world

4:54:29.220 --> 4:54:31.620
 so that they may understand the bigger impact

4:54:31.620 --> 4:54:33.540
 of their inventions.

4:54:33.540 --> 4:54:34.940
 The quote goes like this,

4:54:34.940 --> 4:54:37.660
 In this age of specialization,

4:54:37.660 --> 4:54:39.580
 men who thoroughly know one field

4:54:39.580 --> 4:54:42.940
 are often incompetent to discuss another.

4:54:42.940 --> 4:54:44.140
 The old problems,

4:54:44.140 --> 4:54:46.340
 such as the relation of science and religion,

4:54:46.340 --> 4:54:47.700
 are still with us

4:54:47.700 --> 4:54:51.660
 and I believe present as difficult dilemmas as ever,

4:54:51.660 --> 4:54:54.020
 but they are not often publicly discussed

4:54:54.020 --> 4:54:57.780
 because of the limitations of specialization.

4:54:57.780 --> 4:55:09.300
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
