00:00.000 --> 00:01.800
 When we're beyond good and evil, you know,

00:01.800 --> 00:04.760
 and all that's left is the will to power,

00:04.760 --> 00:07.840
 then why are we surprised at the powerful rise

00:07.840 --> 00:10.880
 and that they use the powerless for their purposes?

00:10.880 --> 00:13.740
 When we forget ideas like equality and rights,

00:13.740 --> 00:15.000
 which are grounded in God,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.020
 why are we surprised that death camps follow?

00:20.480 --> 00:24.040
 The following is a conversation with Bishop Robert Barron,

00:24.040 --> 00:28.060
 founder of Word on Fire and one of the greatest educators

00:28.060 --> 00:32.040
 in the world on the beauty and wisdom within Catholicism,

00:32.040 --> 00:35.600
 Christianity, and religious faith in general.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.720
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:41.120 --> 00:44.580
 And now, dear friends, here's Bishop Robert Barron.

00:45.520 --> 00:47.560
 Let's start with the big question.

00:47.560 --> 00:49.960
 Who is God?

00:49.960 --> 00:52.400
 According to Christianity, according to Catholicism,

00:52.400 --> 00:53.360
 who's God?

00:53.360 --> 00:55.320
 I'll give you Thomas Aquinas's definition.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.840
 God is ipsum, essay, subsistence.

00:57.840 --> 01:01.400
 God is the subsistent act of to be itself.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.120
 Another way to state that in Aquinas

01:03.120 --> 01:06.880
 is God is that reality, unique, absolutely unique,

01:06.880 --> 01:09.760
 in which essence and existence coincide.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.280
 To be God is to be to be.

01:12.280 --> 01:15.480
 Those are all ways of talking about what we mean by God.

01:15.480 --> 01:18.560
 They are kind of nomic, and that's on purpose.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.400
 There's almost a Zen koan kind of quality

01:20.400 --> 01:22.640
 about the way we talk about God.

01:22.640 --> 01:25.800
 I'm saying something that's substantive,

01:25.800 --> 01:28.080
 but it's more in like a via negativa mode.

01:28.080 --> 01:29.360
 It's more like what God is not,

01:29.360 --> 01:31.600
 because there's nothing in the world

01:31.600 --> 01:33.860
 that would correspond to those descriptions.

01:33.860 --> 01:36.840
 So anything in the world would be a being of some type

01:36.840 --> 01:38.640
 or an event of some type,

01:38.640 --> 01:41.240
 some particular mode of existence.

01:41.240 --> 01:45.040
 And God is not an entity in the world.

01:45.040 --> 01:46.800
 I would say that's the fundamental mistake

01:46.800 --> 01:49.480
 that atheists old and new make all the time,

01:49.480 --> 01:53.080
 is they think of God as a big being.

01:53.080 --> 01:57.480
 When Aquinas says that God is not in any genus,

01:57.480 --> 01:59.160
 even the genus of being,

01:59.160 --> 02:01.280
 it's one of the strangest remarks in the whole tradition,

02:01.280 --> 02:02.620
 but it's really interesting.

02:02.620 --> 02:03.860
 So you say, well, at the very least,

02:03.860 --> 02:05.180
 God must be a being, right?

02:05.180 --> 02:09.080
 And Aquinas's answer is no, he's not in the genus of being.

02:09.080 --> 02:12.480
 So we talk about God being beyond being and so on.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.320
 To say in God essence and existence coincide

02:15.320 --> 02:18.480
 is to say God's very nature is to be,

02:18.480 --> 02:21.720
 and that can't be true of any contingent thing in the world.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.660
 So what I'm doing there is I'm gesturing

02:23.660 --> 02:26.120
 the way the tradition does toward God,

02:26.120 --> 02:29.340
 using language that's at the same time

02:29.340 --> 02:32.320
 philosophically precise and gnomic.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.400
 It's both accurate, it's true.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.700
 God, essence and existence coincide.

02:36.700 --> 02:40.800
 What God is is the same as God's active to be.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.280
 But now what does that mean?

02:42.280 --> 02:43.120
 I'm not quite sure,

02:43.120 --> 02:45.200
 because nothing in our ordinary experience

02:45.200 --> 02:46.800
 corresponds to that.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.280
 Everything in our experience is a being of some type.

02:50.280 --> 02:53.660
 So it's existence received according to the mode

02:53.660 --> 02:55.240
 of some essence.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.420
 That's not true of God,

02:58.440 --> 03:00.180
 which is why he can't be found in the world.

03:00.180 --> 03:04.200
 And that's, as I say, the fundamental mistake is,

03:04.200 --> 03:05.780
 oh, I guess theists are those that believe

03:05.780 --> 03:08.600
 there's this being alongside the other beings

03:08.600 --> 03:09.440
 in the universe.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.320
 And then atheists say, oh no, there is no such being.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.800
 And that's precisely wrong.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.240
 That's just a category error.

03:16.760 --> 03:20.260
 Dawkins, I think, cites Bertrand Russell.

03:20.260 --> 03:22.760
 To the effect that proving the nonexistence of God

03:22.760 --> 03:26.160
 is a bit like proving the nonexistence of a China teapot

03:26.160 --> 03:28.640
 orbiting between Earth and Mars.

03:28.640 --> 03:31.480
 No, that's precisely what God is not,

03:31.480 --> 03:34.080
 some entity that's sort of hidden

03:34.080 --> 03:36.920
 among the other entities of the universe.

03:36.920 --> 03:41.140
 God is the reason why there's a contingent realm at all,

03:41.140 --> 03:42.560
 is the way to put it.

03:42.560 --> 03:43.820
 In more theological language,

03:43.820 --> 03:45.840
 God's the creator of all things.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.880
 So if God is outside of our world,

03:48.880 --> 03:51.600
 is it possible for us to visualize,

03:51.600 --> 03:54.420
 to comprehend, to know God?

03:54.420 --> 03:55.780
 Not utterly, of course.

03:55.780 --> 03:58.800
 And I would say our knowledge begins always in this world,

03:58.800 --> 04:00.420
 begins in ordinary experience.

04:00.420 --> 04:03.160
 But I think we can, through metaphysical analysis,

04:03.160 --> 04:05.100
 through philosophical reasoning,

04:05.100 --> 04:08.340
 can come to some knowledge of a reality

04:08.340 --> 04:10.560
 which is transcendent to our experience.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.580
 So we gesture toward it.

04:12.580 --> 04:15.160
 I always like Aquinas who says the language about God

04:15.160 --> 04:17.120
 that we use is analogical.

04:17.120 --> 04:21.360
 So it's not univocal, meaning what I say about that can

04:21.360 --> 04:23.560
 or about this bottle, I can say about God.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.520
 No, that makes God an entity.

04:25.520 --> 04:28.380
 At the same time, it's not simply equivocal.

04:28.380 --> 04:31.560
 So if I say, well, that thing is and God is,

04:31.560 --> 04:33.380
 I mean totally different things.

04:33.380 --> 04:36.000
 No, no, I mean something analogous.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.260
 So to be God is to be, to be.

04:38.260 --> 04:42.100
 So the real meaning of being is the being of God.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.380
 The being of that thing or this thing,

04:44.380 --> 04:47.660
 or the being of galaxies or subatomic particles

04:47.660 --> 04:50.600
 would be analogous to God's manner of being.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.440
 So on that basis, I can make some statements.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.280
 I can, I can theorize.

04:56.280 --> 04:59.320
 And even at the limit, as you suggest, I can visualize.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.200
 So we have metaphors for God,

05:01.200 --> 05:04.280
 and the Bible is replete with those, right?

05:04.280 --> 05:06.200
 So God is a rock.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.460
 You know, God's like a lion.

05:07.460 --> 05:08.720
 God's like this and that.

05:08.720 --> 05:11.200
 Or the Bible will sometimes imagine God

05:11.200 --> 05:14.020
 as a human being walking around, you know.

05:14.020 --> 05:15.960
 Now, only the crudest fundamentalism would say,

05:15.960 --> 05:20.160
 well, that's a univocal, accurate description of God.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.440
 It's an image that's catching something

05:22.440 --> 05:23.900
 of God's manner of being.

05:25.200 --> 05:30.200
 Then what does it mean to believe in God?

05:31.260 --> 05:34.460
 So there's a word, and we have to limit ourselves

05:34.460 --> 05:37.300
 to human interpretable words today.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.420
 There's a word called faith.

05:39.420 --> 05:40.940
 What does faith mean?

05:40.940 --> 05:44.760
 So if we can't really directly know God,

05:45.660 --> 05:50.060
 you kind of sneak up to the idea of God with metaphors.

05:50.060 --> 05:51.960
 Better he sneaks up on us.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.760
 Because I like the language of grace.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.880
 God's action comes first.

05:55.880 --> 06:00.540
 So if I stay perfectly within the realm of I'm seeking

06:00.540 --> 06:04.660
 with my kind of eagle eyes and my inquiring mind,

06:04.660 --> 06:06.160
 I'm not gonna find God that way.

06:06.160 --> 06:09.740
 I might find a path that opens up.

06:09.740 --> 06:12.140
 But I would say finally God finds me,

06:12.140 --> 06:14.020
 and I think then the language of faith

06:14.020 --> 06:15.280
 begins to make more sense.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.860
 I'm with Paul Tillich, though, the Protestant theologian,

06:18.860 --> 06:20.660
 said the most misunderstood word

06:20.660 --> 06:22.900
 in the religious vocabulary is faith.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.880
 Because he said the way we take it usually

06:24.880 --> 06:26.780
 is something subrational.

06:26.780 --> 06:29.320
 You know, I have proof of this.

06:29.320 --> 06:32.340
 I really know this, and I only kind of believe that.

06:32.340 --> 06:35.920
 Like, that's just a personal opinion or impression.

06:35.920 --> 06:40.220
 But that's to identify faith with the kind of infrarational.

06:40.220 --> 06:41.780
 And that's not it.

06:41.780 --> 06:43.540
 I mean, I don't want something infrarational.

06:43.540 --> 06:47.340
 I don't want superstition or childish credulity.

06:47.340 --> 06:51.540
 So authentic faith is the darkness beyond reason

06:51.540 --> 06:52.900
 and on the far side of reason.

06:52.900 --> 06:55.860
 It's super irrational, not infrarational.

06:55.860 --> 06:58.100
 And that's a very important move.

06:58.100 --> 06:59.980
 At the limit of what I can know,

06:59.980 --> 07:02.540
 at the limit of my striving and my vision,

07:02.540 --> 07:04.940
 there's this horizon that opens up.

07:04.940 --> 07:08.140
 And I think that's true even in ordinary ways of knowing.

07:08.140 --> 07:09.300
 There's a kind of a horizon

07:09.300 --> 07:11.620
 that lures us beyond what I've got.

07:11.620 --> 07:14.380
 Faith has to do more with that kind of darkness

07:14.380 --> 07:16.960
 rather than a darkness prior to reason.

07:18.060 --> 07:22.000
 The darkness beyond the horizon prior to reason,

07:22.000 --> 07:24.420
 first of all, the poetry of your language is incredible.

07:24.420 --> 07:27.260
 To be, to be, I have a million questions.

07:27.260 --> 07:28.540
 Yeah, go ahead.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.180
 I do too on this.

07:30.180 --> 07:32.420
 So first of all, let me just jump around.

07:32.420 --> 07:34.800
 You mentioned to be, to be a few times.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.340
 What does that mean?

07:36.340 --> 07:39.660
 Well, to be me is to be a human being, right?

07:39.660 --> 07:40.800
 To be this is to be a table,

07:40.800 --> 07:41.700
 to be this is to be a microphone.

07:41.700 --> 07:44.000
 So it's, I'll use Aquinas's language.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.440
 It's the act of being poured, if you want,

07:47.440 --> 07:50.180
 into the receptacle of some essential principle.

07:50.180 --> 07:52.420
 So it's got an ontological structure.

07:52.420 --> 07:56.660
 It's an existent, it's a thing that exists,

07:56.660 --> 07:59.340
 but it's existing in a limited way

07:59.340 --> 08:01.140
 according to an essential principle.

08:01.140 --> 08:04.940
 So God, so what's God?

08:04.940 --> 08:05.760
 What's God's name?

08:05.760 --> 08:06.900
 What kind of being is he?

08:07.940 --> 08:09.640
 We'll go back to Moses now.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.140
 When the Israelites asked me, you know, what's your name?

08:13.140 --> 08:14.220
 What should I tell them?

08:14.220 --> 08:17.160
 And he says, you know, famously, I am who I am.

08:17.160 --> 08:20.660
 But see, Aquinas reads that as a very accurate remark.

08:20.660 --> 08:24.080
 So Moses is wondering, okay, there's a lot of gods

08:24.080 --> 08:25.740
 and there's a lot of things, a lot of entities.

08:25.740 --> 08:26.580
 Well, which one are you?

08:26.580 --> 08:27.500
 You gotta be one of them.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.260
 So tell me your name.

08:29.260 --> 08:31.260
 In philosophical language, give me the essence

08:31.260 --> 08:34.440
 that receives your act of existing, right?

08:34.440 --> 08:37.300
 And God's answer blows the mind of Moses

08:37.300 --> 08:38.140
 and the whole tradition.

08:38.140 --> 08:40.000
 I am who I am.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.820
 To be God is to be.

08:43.380 --> 08:44.520
 So I'm not this or that.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.360
 I'm not up or down.

08:45.360 --> 08:46.700
 I'm not here or there.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.420
 God is that whose center is everywhere

08:48.420 --> 08:51.640
 and whose circumference is nowhere, as the mystics put it.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.500
 Now, can I get a clear and distinct idea of that?

08:54.500 --> 08:56.780
 No, and in a way, that's the whole point.

08:56.780 --> 09:00.100
 If I could, I'd be talking about a being of some kind.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.200
 So to be God is to be.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.260
 To be is to, and that's, you know,

09:03.260 --> 09:06.060
 Moses, take off your sandals, you're on holy ground.

09:06.060 --> 09:07.340
 So I'm gonna go over confidently

09:07.340 --> 09:09.780
 and find out what this thing is, this burning bush.

09:09.780 --> 09:11.480
 I'm gonna find out.

09:11.480 --> 09:12.900
 No, no, no.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.500
 Take off your shoes, you're on holy ground

09:14.500 --> 09:16.340
 because you're not in charge here.

09:16.340 --> 09:17.660
 You're not in command.

09:17.660 --> 09:19.940
 Because if you've got shoes on,

09:19.940 --> 09:21.180
 you can walk wherever you want.

09:21.180 --> 09:22.500
 You can walk with confidence.

09:22.500 --> 09:26.380
 But you take your shoes off, you're much more vulnerable.

09:26.380 --> 09:29.580
 And that's appropriate when you're talking about God.

09:29.580 --> 09:30.740
 But here's another interesting thing.

09:30.740 --> 09:31.940
 I didn't think about the burning bush

09:31.940 --> 09:33.580
 in this connection before,

09:33.580 --> 09:37.760
 but it's a bush that's on fire but not consumed.

09:39.060 --> 09:41.500
 Beings are competitive with each other.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.940
 And so these can't be in the same place at the same time,

09:43.940 --> 09:44.900
 these two beings.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.860
 They're mutually exclusive if you want.

09:48.740 --> 09:52.820
 But as God comes close to a creature,

09:52.820 --> 09:55.780
 he doesn't destroy it or consume it.

09:55.780 --> 09:57.620
 But the creature becomes more beautiful

09:57.620 --> 09:59.700
 and more radiant, right?

09:59.700 --> 10:03.080
 And see, compare it to the classical gods and goddesses.

10:03.080 --> 10:06.580
 When they come bursting into life and experience,

10:06.580 --> 10:09.140
 things are incinerated and people give way

10:09.140 --> 10:10.700
 and they're overwhelmed.

10:10.700 --> 10:13.660
 Then there's this biblical idea of God comes close

10:13.660 --> 10:17.060
 and sets things on fire but doesn't burn them up.

10:17.060 --> 10:19.140
 And that's because he's not a competitive being

10:19.140 --> 10:20.140
 in the world.

10:20.140 --> 10:25.140
 If he were a big being, then he'd be competing for space,

10:25.140 --> 10:27.980
 so to speak, on the same ontological grid.

10:27.980 --> 10:29.180
 But he's not like that.

10:30.180 --> 10:35.140
 So God can come close and we come more fully alive.

10:35.140 --> 10:37.240
 Now we're starting to gesture toward the incarnation,

10:37.240 --> 10:38.820
 I mean, the central Christian doctrine,

10:38.820 --> 10:42.340
 that God can actually become a human

10:42.340 --> 10:45.980
 without overwhelming the human he becomes, right?

10:45.980 --> 10:47.980
 So I mean, that's kind of the next step.

10:47.980 --> 10:51.740
 But the basic idea of God is noncompetitively

10:51.740 --> 10:53.340
 transcendent to the world.

10:53.340 --> 10:54.900
 That's another way to get at it.

10:54.900 --> 10:57.940
 Noncompetitively transcendent to the world

10:57.940 --> 11:01.780
 so as beyond being as the source of being.

11:01.780 --> 11:03.020
 Right.

11:03.020 --> 11:06.100
 Let me make it maybe more imagistic.

11:06.100 --> 11:10.300
 I think a really good analogy would be author to book.

11:10.300 --> 11:13.160
 Right, so like Tolkien or someone that writes

11:13.160 --> 11:16.260
 one of these big sprawling novels.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.580
 And Tolkien's good too because he creates a whole world.

11:18.580 --> 11:21.180
 He creates a new nature, a new language, new history,

11:21.180 --> 11:23.320
 all that, think of the thousands of characters

11:23.320 --> 11:25.380
 and the plots and subplots and all of it.

11:26.300 --> 11:28.620
 Tolkien is utterly responsible

11:28.620 --> 11:31.540
 for every bit of that story, right?

11:31.540 --> 11:34.180
 Every character, every plot, every subplot,

11:34.180 --> 11:36.780
 every description, he's completely responsible.

11:36.780 --> 11:39.580
 He's involved in every nook and cranny of it.

11:39.580 --> 11:43.140
 But he's not in the story, he's not in the book.

11:43.140 --> 11:45.760
 You're not gonna find him as a character in the book.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.460
 So that's the category mistake of the atheist in a way

11:48.460 --> 11:50.540
 is I'm looking for God, he's a character

11:50.540 --> 11:51.900
 in this story somewhere.

11:51.900 --> 11:54.620
 No, he's the author of the story.

11:54.620 --> 11:58.540
 Mysteriously present to every aspect of the story,

11:58.540 --> 12:00.780
 but not a character in it.

12:00.780 --> 12:03.940
 Right, he is deeply in the story somehow.

12:03.940 --> 12:04.820
 Right. He's present,

12:04.820 --> 12:08.700
 but he's not, even if he is a character,

12:08.700 --> 12:13.100
 he's not really, the full embodiment is not a character.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.460
 And people inside the book

12:16.460 --> 12:18.500
 can't really know about the author.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.780
 Right.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.300
 No, right. Well, see, Augustine says,

12:22.300 --> 12:25.340
 God is simultaneously intime or intimo meo

12:25.340 --> 12:26.860
 et superior sumo meo.

12:26.860 --> 12:30.300
 He's closer to me than I am to myself,

12:30.300 --> 12:33.340
 and he's higher than anything I could possibly imagine

12:33.340 --> 12:34.380
 at the same time.

12:34.380 --> 12:36.460
 But see, once you get the insight

12:36.460 --> 12:38.940
 that God is the sheer act of to be,

12:38.940 --> 12:40.260
 well, of course that's true.

12:40.260 --> 12:45.260
 So right now, God is sustaining us in existence.

12:45.780 --> 12:46.940
 True.

12:46.940 --> 12:50.140
 Aquinas says, God is in all things by essence,

12:50.140 --> 12:53.460
 presence, and power, and most intimately so.

12:53.460 --> 12:56.780
 And he's nowhere in this room.

12:56.780 --> 12:58.140
 Okay, well, where's God?

12:58.140 --> 12:59.700
 He's nowhere in this room.

12:59.700 --> 13:02.100
 He's totaliter aliter, we say.

13:02.100 --> 13:03.940
 He's totally other.

13:03.940 --> 13:05.020
 Same time.

13:05.020 --> 13:06.840
 But once you crack that code, though,

13:06.840 --> 13:09.500
 I think you see it of why that would be true.

13:09.500 --> 13:12.180
 And see, now I'm getting from more philosophical language

13:12.180 --> 13:13.260
 to more mystical language,

13:13.260 --> 13:15.220
 because all the mystics talk that way

13:15.220 --> 13:18.740
 in these high paradoxes about God's availability

13:18.740 --> 13:20.660
 and unavailability.

13:20.660 --> 13:24.220
 I've often thought in the Bible, story after story,

13:24.220 --> 13:28.440
 God can neither be grasped nor hidden from.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.940
 So the first sinful instinct is to grasp at God.

13:32.940 --> 13:36.340
 I've got him, I understand him, I can manipulate him.

13:36.340 --> 13:37.180
 No, no, no.

13:37.180 --> 13:39.700
 Story after story is told, you can't do that.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.420
 Well, then the other extreme of the sinner,

13:41.420 --> 13:43.480
 all right, then I'm gonna run from God.

13:43.480 --> 13:45.680
 I'm gonna avoid God.

13:45.680 --> 13:50.020
 Jonah and the whale, so he has the call from God,

13:50.020 --> 13:51.780
 and he said, no, no, I'm gonna refuse that.

13:51.780 --> 13:53.380
 I'm gonna run as far away.

13:53.380 --> 13:55.940
 I'm gonna go to Tarshish, which meant Timbuktu for them,

13:55.940 --> 13:57.140
 at the end of the world.

13:58.260 --> 13:59.900
 God's got the whale, swallows him up,

13:59.900 --> 14:01.860
 and brings him right back where God wants him.

14:01.860 --> 14:03.580
 It's a poetic way of saying

14:03.580 --> 14:05.880
 you can't escape the press of God.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.500
 At the same time, Tower of Babel.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.020
 I'm gonna build a tower up to God.

14:09.020 --> 14:11.140
 I'm gonna grab hold of God.

14:11.140 --> 14:12.900
 No, no, no, you can't do that.

14:12.900 --> 14:15.420
 So, live in the space in between those two things,

14:15.420 --> 14:18.180
 which would be the space of friendship with God,

14:19.380 --> 14:20.740
 falling in love with God

14:20.740 --> 14:22.880
 is neither grasping nor hiding from God.

14:25.260 --> 14:28.700
 You mentioned, again, a lot of beautiful poetic things.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.380
 You mentioned grace.

14:30.380 --> 14:31.220
 Yeah.

14:31.220 --> 14:32.320
 You mentioned sin.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.220
 You mentioned incarnation.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.540
 Is there a philosophical, pragmatic way

14:37.540 --> 14:40.740
 to start talking about the pillars of Christianity?

14:40.740 --> 14:45.740
 What are the defining things that make Christianity to you,

14:46.100 --> 14:51.100
 and broadly speaking, to those that follow the religion?

14:51.660 --> 14:53.340
 In a way, what we're doing so far

14:53.340 --> 14:55.160
 is a necessary propaedeutic,

14:55.160 --> 14:56.900
 because we're talking about God.

14:58.300 --> 15:00.100
 What makes Christianity distinctive, of course,

15:00.100 --> 15:01.860
 is the claim of the incarnation.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.380
 So, we come up out of Judaism.

15:03.380 --> 15:06.140
 We come up out of this great monotheistic tradition.

15:06.140 --> 15:09.100
 And the Bible itself and all the great commentaries

15:09.100 --> 15:11.380
 within Judaism, I think, would agree

15:11.380 --> 15:15.500
 with this basic theistic stuff that I've been talking about.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.440
 Take Moses Maimonides, for example.

15:18.420 --> 15:20.900
 Now, what makes Christianity distinct,

15:20.900 --> 15:25.820
 this supremely weird claim that God becomes one of us,

15:25.820 --> 15:30.540
 God becomes a creature, but without ceasing to be God

15:30.540 --> 15:32.020
 and without overwhelming the integrity

15:32.020 --> 15:33.540
 of the creature he becomes.

15:33.540 --> 15:35.300
 What we see in the burning bush,

15:35.300 --> 15:37.940
 that principle which obtains across the board,

15:37.940 --> 15:39.440
 so the closer God comes to me,

15:39.440 --> 15:42.140
 the more radiant I become, right?

15:42.140 --> 15:44.620
 But take that now to the nth degree,

15:44.620 --> 15:46.340
 would be what we mean by the incarnation,

15:46.340 --> 15:51.340
 the incarnation of the Son of God becoming a creature

15:51.460 --> 15:56.260
 in such a way as to make humanity radiant and beautiful.

15:57.340 --> 15:58.860
 That's the pillar of Christianity.

15:58.860 --> 16:00.340
 It's the incarnation.

16:01.780 --> 16:03.820
 And what follows from that is the redemption

16:03.820 --> 16:07.540
 of all of reality, so not just of human beings,

16:07.540 --> 16:12.540
 but in becoming a creature, God divinizes the world.

16:14.460 --> 16:17.540
 The Greek fathers always said God became human,

16:17.540 --> 16:19.460
 that humans might become God.

16:19.460 --> 16:21.500
 And that's a good way to sum up, I think,

16:21.500 --> 16:23.220
 the essence of Christianity.

16:23.220 --> 16:25.060
 Why is this such an important thing?

16:25.060 --> 16:26.820
 So it's a distinctive thing,

16:26.820 --> 16:30.020
 but why is it so important philosophically

16:30.020 --> 16:32.020
 to what it means to be a Christian?

16:34.140 --> 16:36.980
 What impact did that have on our world,

16:36.980 --> 16:39.460
 on human civilization, on human nature,

16:39.460 --> 16:43.300
 on our morals of why live, what to live for,

16:43.300 --> 16:44.500
 and the meaning of it all?

16:44.500 --> 16:46.460
 Why is incarnation so important?

16:46.460 --> 16:48.060
 Well, I think it's massively important

16:48.060 --> 16:49.900
 because it's the divinization principle

16:49.900 --> 16:52.300
 that God wants to divinize his creation

16:52.300 --> 16:54.580
 and sort of in this concentrated point

16:54.580 --> 16:56.220
 of Jesus of Nazareth.

16:56.220 --> 16:58.500
 But then we talk about the mystical body of Jesus,

16:58.500 --> 17:00.220
 so that goes right back to Paul.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.180
 As we're grafted onto Christ,

17:02.180 --> 17:04.380
 we talk about that as the church,

17:04.380 --> 17:08.420
 we become like cells and molecules in an organism.

17:08.420 --> 17:10.460
 That's the church, it's not an organization,

17:10.460 --> 17:13.980
 that's a deformation of ecclesiology.

17:13.980 --> 17:17.060
 The church is this organism that begins with Jesus

17:17.060 --> 17:20.780
 and then he's drawing all of humanity,

17:20.780 --> 17:23.180
 but ultimately all of nature,

17:23.180 --> 17:26.380
 all of creation to himself.

17:26.380 --> 17:27.580
 When the Son of Man is lifted up,

17:27.580 --> 17:29.420
 he will draw all things to himself,

17:29.420 --> 17:34.420
 that idea of the gathering in of a scattered creation.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.340
 So in that way, it's at the heart of it.

17:36.340 --> 17:37.820
 Then there's all kinds of things.

17:37.820 --> 17:39.660
 If God becomes human,

17:39.660 --> 17:41.420
 that means there's a dignity to humanity,

17:41.420 --> 17:43.900
 which goes beyond anything any humanist

17:43.900 --> 17:46.420
 of any stripe has ever said, right?

17:46.420 --> 17:49.180
 Ancient, medieval, modern, contemporary.

17:50.180 --> 17:53.020
 Christianity is the greatest humanism imaginable.

17:53.020 --> 17:56.740
 God became one of us in order to divinize us.

17:56.740 --> 17:59.420
 The goal of my life is not just to be a good person,

17:59.420 --> 18:02.700
 not just to be materially successful,

18:02.700 --> 18:05.420
 not just to be a member of society.

18:05.420 --> 18:07.460
 The goal of my life is to become

18:07.460 --> 18:09.380
 a participant in the divine nature.

18:09.380 --> 18:12.260
 And so I don't think there is a humanism greater than that,

18:12.260 --> 18:13.940
 even conceivably.

18:13.940 --> 18:16.620
 So that's where I think humanism

18:16.620 --> 18:19.340
 is profoundly influenced by the incarnation.

18:20.380 --> 18:25.140
 And just our notion of God is noncompetitive to us.

18:25.140 --> 18:27.580
 And it's so important, because I think in so many systems

18:27.580 --> 18:29.460
 from mythology onward,

18:29.460 --> 18:31.900
 you have these competitive understandings of God.

18:32.780 --> 18:35.660
 When Jesus says to his disciples the night before he dies,

18:35.660 --> 18:38.180
 I no longer call you servants but friends,

18:38.180 --> 18:40.260
 it's an extraordinary moment.

18:40.260 --> 18:43.620
 Because every God who's ever been served,

18:43.620 --> 18:45.580
 well, that's the best we can hope for

18:45.580 --> 18:48.020
 is that we'll be as the servant of God.

18:48.020 --> 18:50.220
 You know, I'll try to obey you, Lord.

18:50.220 --> 18:51.540
 I'll try to do what you want.

18:51.540 --> 18:54.860
 But when Jesus says, I no longer call you servants

18:54.860 --> 18:58.300
 or slaves, he would have said in the Greek there, you know.

18:58.300 --> 19:01.420
 But friends, I don't know,

19:01.420 --> 19:03.380
 I can't imagine anything greater than that,

19:03.380 --> 19:04.860
 becoming God's friend.

19:04.860 --> 19:08.620
 That's a call to become one with God.

19:08.620 --> 19:12.140
 It's possible to become one with God.

19:12.140 --> 19:13.460
 Now I should mention,

19:13.460 --> 19:15.920
 you're one of the greatest religious communicators

19:15.920 --> 19:17.580
 I've ever experienced.

19:17.580 --> 19:19.900
 A huge number of people are fans of yours.

19:19.900 --> 19:23.300
 You've done a lot of great conversations.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.140
 You've done Reddit AMAs,

19:25.140 --> 19:29.800
 which is a very unique, bold, brave thing.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.900
 And on one of them, somebody asked,

19:34.080 --> 19:37.140
 what's the most challenging of the seven deadly sins?

19:37.140 --> 19:41.060
 So first, what are the seven deadly sins?

19:41.060 --> 19:43.660
 What do they have to do with Christianity?

19:43.660 --> 19:47.820
 How essential, how crucial they are to the religion?

19:47.820 --> 19:51.580
 And what's the most challenging in our modern day?

19:51.580 --> 19:55.900
 Yeah, to name them, pride, envy, anger,

19:55.900 --> 19:59.340
 sloth, avarice, gluttony, and lust

19:59.340 --> 20:01.220
 are the seven deadly sins.

20:01.220 --> 20:03.460
 We're called capital sins sometimes,

20:03.460 --> 20:07.380
 they're the head sins from which things tend to flow.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.780
 The most fundamental is pride.

20:11.380 --> 20:13.420
 Probably most people today, if you talk about like vice,

20:13.420 --> 20:15.300
 or you talk about a deadly sin,

20:15.300 --> 20:16.820
 they would think about lust.

20:16.820 --> 20:19.020
 But the classical authors, including Dante,

20:19.020 --> 20:21.540
 who does this pictorially,

20:21.540 --> 20:23.740
 that's the least of the deadly sins is lust,

20:23.740 --> 20:25.980
 because it's the one that's most sort of dependent

20:25.980 --> 20:29.180
 upon the body and its passions and so on.

20:29.180 --> 20:30.660
 The most important is pride.

20:30.660 --> 20:33.040
 Pride is the deadliest of deadly sins.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.980
 And it's very simple to see why.

20:34.980 --> 20:38.380
 Pride is, Augustine calls it incurvatus in se.

20:38.380 --> 20:40.940
 I'm caved in around myself.

20:40.940 --> 20:44.340
 Like a black hole, right, to get into the scientific.

20:44.340 --> 20:46.660
 But the black hole to me is a great symbol,

20:46.660 --> 20:48.880
 you know, that it's so heavy

20:48.880 --> 20:50.780
 that it draws everything, including light.

20:50.780 --> 20:52.740
 Nothing can escape from it.

20:52.740 --> 20:54.140
 See, that's the sinner.

20:54.140 --> 20:55.740
 We're all sinners.

20:55.740 --> 20:56.800
 We're like black holes,

20:56.800 --> 20:59.360
 that we draw everything into ourselves.

21:00.360 --> 21:04.820
 So as a sinner, and I'll confess I'm a sinner,

21:04.820 --> 21:08.280
 the temptation is, okay, this is the Bishop Barron moment,

21:08.280 --> 21:12.420
 and I'm drawing you now into my world and so on.

21:13.920 --> 21:16.500
 What that does is it kills us off,

21:16.500 --> 21:20.520
 and it darkens life, and it makes it small,

21:20.520 --> 21:23.460
 and heavy, and awful, right?

21:23.460 --> 21:28.380
 It's like, but see, compared to the contrasting thing,

21:28.380 --> 21:31.420
 is when you're lost in a moment,

21:31.420 --> 21:33.840
 you're not concerned about the impression I'm making.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.960
 You're not concerned about drawing the world into yourself.

21:35.960 --> 21:38.260
 You're not concerned about this monkey on my back

21:38.260 --> 21:39.640
 that's always telling me, you know,

21:39.640 --> 21:41.660
 look good and sound right.

21:41.660 --> 21:44.140
 But you're lost in something.

21:44.140 --> 21:46.360
 You're just talking, you know, to a friend,

21:46.360 --> 21:47.620
 and the two of you together

21:47.620 --> 21:50.300
 are discovering something true or beautiful.

21:50.300 --> 21:53.040
 You're lost in a movie, or you're lost in a book.

21:53.040 --> 21:54.880
 Those are the best moments in life.

21:54.880 --> 21:55.720
 Those are the best,

21:55.720 --> 21:58.420
 because they're the least prideful moments, right?

21:58.420 --> 22:00.700
 That's when the light comes out.

22:00.700 --> 22:05.380
 I become radiant, because I'm overcoming this tendency

22:05.380 --> 22:06.620
 to fall in on myself.

22:08.300 --> 22:12.780
 Dante is so good, because the way he pictures Satan

22:12.780 --> 22:14.260
 in Divine Comedy, and you know,

22:14.260 --> 22:15.700
 he's at the center of the Earth.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.220
 So like a black hole that way,

22:17.220 --> 22:19.020
 like he's at the center of gravity.

22:19.020 --> 22:21.060
 He's at the heaviest place.

22:21.060 --> 22:23.980
 And there's not fire where he is, but ice,

22:23.980 --> 22:26.220
 which is a much, much better image,

22:26.220 --> 22:29.100
 that you're frozen in place, and you're stuck.

22:29.100 --> 22:31.460
 And he's got wings, right?

22:31.460 --> 22:33.720
 And they used to be angel wings, because he's an angel,

22:33.720 --> 22:35.500
 but now they're like bat wings for Dante,

22:35.500 --> 22:37.440
 and they're flapping.

22:37.440 --> 22:40.540
 And all they're doing is making the world around him colder,

22:40.540 --> 22:43.320
 because he's ice, he's stuck in his own iciness,

22:43.320 --> 22:45.660
 and then he's beating his wings over the ice,

22:45.660 --> 22:46.940
 making everyone else colder.

22:46.940 --> 22:48.860
 It's a great image.

22:48.860 --> 22:50.300
 And then he has, this is cool too,

22:50.300 --> 22:53.060
 he has three faces, Satan,

22:53.060 --> 22:55.140
 because he's the simulacrum of the Trinity.

22:55.140 --> 22:57.140
 So every sinner thinks he's God.

22:57.140 --> 22:58.500
 So I pretend I'm God.

22:58.500 --> 23:00.380
 So he's got the three faces.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.440
 And from all six eyes, he weeps.

23:03.780 --> 23:07.220
 Also from all three mouths, he's chewing a sinner.

23:07.220 --> 23:11.280
 He's got Cassius, Brutus, and Judas in the three mouths,

23:11.280 --> 23:13.020
 you know, the three traitors.

23:13.020 --> 23:16.420
 But I thought, it's just a great image

23:16.420 --> 23:19.480
 of all of us sinners, is we're stuck,

23:19.480 --> 23:22.220
 it's heavy, it's cold,

23:22.220 --> 23:25.060
 we're chewing on our past resentments,

23:25.060 --> 23:27.140
 we're weeping in our sadness,

23:27.140 --> 23:29.280
 and we're making the world around us colder.

23:29.280 --> 23:30.380
 It's beautiful, it's great.

23:30.380 --> 23:31.580
 So that's pride.

23:31.580 --> 23:33.180
 See, that's an image of pride,

23:33.180 --> 23:35.540
 because Satan, that's his great sin, pride,

23:35.540 --> 23:38.260
 which is why he needed Michael, right, Mikael,

23:38.260 --> 23:41.040
 who's like God, so that the great challenge to him,

23:41.040 --> 23:43.500
 which we need all the time,

23:43.500 --> 23:45.420
 is someone to say, wait a minute, wait a minute,

23:45.420 --> 23:46.960
 you're not God.

23:46.960 --> 23:49.220
 But the minute we say, I'm God,

23:49.220 --> 23:52.660
 whew, black hole, I now cave in on myself,

23:52.660 --> 23:54.940
 I suck everything into myself,

23:54.940 --> 23:57.620
 and I turn into Dante Satan.

23:57.620 --> 23:59.700
 So that's a great image, that's pride.

23:59.700 --> 24:01.660
 That's the most fundamental.

24:01.660 --> 24:04.180
 That's the uber capital sin.

24:04.180 --> 24:06.260
 All the other ones flow from that, in a way.

24:06.260 --> 24:10.180
 So in general, empathy, humility, compassion,

24:10.180 --> 24:14.700
 love thy neighbor, is the way to fight the sin of pride.

24:14.700 --> 24:16.980
 Right, which is why the masters tend to say,

24:16.980 --> 24:19.300
 this was Bernard, St. Bernard was asked,

24:19.300 --> 24:21.140
 what are the three most important virtues?

24:21.140 --> 24:24.660
 And he said, humilitas, humilitas, and humilitas,

24:24.660 --> 24:26.500
 because it's the opposite of pride.

24:26.500 --> 24:29.820
 So, but you know, they're bringing Aquinas in again,

24:29.820 --> 24:32.180
 because we think, oh, humility, I'm no good.

24:32.180 --> 24:33.380
 That's not what it means at all.

24:33.380 --> 24:35.500
 It means what I was describing before,

24:35.500 --> 24:37.780
 when you're just lost in something,

24:37.780 --> 24:39.860
 you're just lost in it.

24:39.860 --> 24:41.940
 My image, I live out in Santa Barbara,

24:41.940 --> 24:44.180
 and I like to walk on the beach out there,

24:44.180 --> 24:45.620
 and there's a section of the beach

24:45.620 --> 24:48.500
 where they let the dogs run free without leashes.

24:48.500 --> 24:52.620
 And when you see a dog, and he's well cared for,

24:52.620 --> 24:53.780
 and his master's right there,

24:53.780 --> 24:56.100
 and the master's throwing the tennis ball out into the surf,

24:56.100 --> 24:57.940
 and the dog goes galloping out into the surf,

24:57.940 --> 25:00.660
 and he gets it with a big smile, and comes running back.

25:00.660 --> 25:02.420
 That's humility.

25:02.420 --> 25:03.420
 That's an image of heaven,

25:03.420 --> 25:05.900
 because he's just lost in that moment.

25:05.900 --> 25:07.860
 He doesn't care about impressing anybody.

25:07.860 --> 25:10.620
 He doesn't care about what people think of him.

25:10.620 --> 25:13.340
 He's just lost in it.

25:13.340 --> 25:15.460
 That's it, that's heaven, right?

25:16.380 --> 25:18.820
 And those moments in our life, when we get that,

25:18.820 --> 25:21.140
 it's a little hint of paradise.

25:21.140 --> 25:24.620
 But the trouble is most of us live, frankly, most of the time

25:24.620 --> 25:27.860
 in various levels of hell,

25:27.860 --> 25:29.940
 and we're dealing with these deadly sins.

25:29.940 --> 25:32.540
 Like envy flows from pride, because if I'm prideful,

25:32.540 --> 25:35.780
 I'm a black hole, I'm in Curvatus In Se, I'm collapsed in,

25:35.780 --> 25:37.780
 what am I really gonna be concerned about?

25:37.780 --> 25:39.140
 That guy's getting more attention than I am.

25:39.140 --> 25:40.540
 That guy's richer than I am.

25:40.540 --> 25:43.500
 That lady, she's got a bigger reputation than I do,

25:43.500 --> 25:46.260
 and why don't I have that, right?

25:46.260 --> 25:49.180
 So envy is a very close daughter of pride.

25:50.460 --> 25:51.940
 Anger flows from it.

25:51.940 --> 25:53.460
 Why do I get angry?

25:53.460 --> 25:54.980
 The dog isn't getting angry on the beach

25:54.980 --> 25:56.700
 when he's running after the tennis ball.

25:56.700 --> 25:57.660
 But I get angry all the time,

25:57.660 --> 25:59.980
 I sputter with anger when things aren't going my way,

25:59.980 --> 26:02.580
 and you're insulting me, and you're not doing what I want,

26:02.580 --> 26:04.660
 and I'm being hurt, my reputation.

26:04.660 --> 26:07.540
 So anger flows from pride, you know?

26:07.540 --> 26:10.260
 All of them do, all of the deadly sins do.

26:10.260 --> 26:13.820
 So you said, I'm a sinner.

26:13.820 --> 26:15.340
 So we're all sinners.

26:15.340 --> 26:16.180
 Yeah.

26:17.780 --> 26:19.220
 And you mentioned Satan.

26:19.220 --> 26:22.660
 Where's the, so there's heaven and hell,

26:22.660 --> 26:24.420
 there's God and Satan.

26:25.380 --> 26:29.860
 Where's the line between what it means to be good

26:30.940 --> 26:34.420
 and not good enough?

26:34.420 --> 26:38.180
 Or I hesitate to use the word sort of evil,

26:38.180 --> 26:43.020
 but maybe overwhelmingly sinful.

26:43.020 --> 26:45.500
 Where's the line between hell and heaven?

26:45.500 --> 26:47.100
 Think of them as limit concepts, maybe.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.020
 They're like heuristic devices.

26:49.020 --> 26:53.580
 So heaven would name this ultimate friendship with God.

26:53.580 --> 26:54.700
 So think of the dog on the beach,

26:54.700 --> 26:58.120
 who is just, he's fallen in love with his environment,

26:58.120 --> 26:59.660
 with his master, with the surf.

26:59.660 --> 27:01.260
 He's just lost in it, right?

27:01.260 --> 27:04.400
 He's forgotten himself, he's transcended himself,

27:04.400 --> 27:08.740
 and is now lost in the wonder of the beauty of that place.

27:08.740 --> 27:11.540
 Now, imagine the limit of that

27:11.540 --> 27:14.500
 is the friendship with God that we talked about,

27:14.500 --> 27:16.140
 that I become the friend of God.

27:16.140 --> 27:19.100
 I become so forgetful of myself,

27:19.100 --> 27:22.260
 so lost in the beauty and truth and goodness of God

27:22.260 --> 27:25.980
 that I found beatitude, right?

27:25.980 --> 27:29.200
 I found joy, the beatific vision, we call it.

27:30.220 --> 27:31.460
 That's the limit case.

27:31.460 --> 27:32.400
 That's where we're tending.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.180
 That's where God wants us to go.

27:34.180 --> 27:36.180
 Think of hell as the limit case in the opposite direction.

27:36.180 --> 27:37.980
 That's curvatus in se.

27:37.980 --> 27:39.480
 That's the black hole.

27:39.480 --> 27:40.780
 And we're all sinners,

27:40.780 --> 27:42.900
 meaning we're somewhere on that spectrum.

27:42.900 --> 27:45.180
 We have good days and bad days,

27:45.180 --> 27:46.740
 and we have good moments and bad moments,

27:46.740 --> 27:49.980
 and I can be drawn toward sin.

27:51.060 --> 27:54.260
 What's God's purpose on Christianity's reading

27:54.260 --> 27:56.420
 is to bring us out of that.

27:56.420 --> 27:57.620
 Now, where did he go?

27:57.620 --> 28:00.380
 He went all the way into it to get us out of it.

28:00.380 --> 28:02.780
 It's like pulling a sock back out.

28:02.780 --> 28:04.300
 The sock's inside out, you have to go all the way in

28:04.300 --> 28:05.340
 and pull it back out.

28:05.340 --> 28:07.900
 And so God had to go all the way down.

28:08.860 --> 28:12.200
 There's the trajectory of the incarnation.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.820
 Though he was in the form of God,

28:15.820 --> 28:16.860
 and this is St. Paul,

28:16.860 --> 28:18.380
 Jesus did not deem equality with God

28:18.380 --> 28:19.220
 a thing to be grasped at,

28:19.220 --> 28:21.560
 but rather emptied himself and took the form of a slave,

28:21.560 --> 28:23.400
 being born in the likeness of men.

28:23.400 --> 28:26.800
 But then he was known to be of human estate,

28:26.800 --> 28:30.420
 and he accepted even death, death on a cross.

28:30.420 --> 28:34.540
 And so Paul imagines the incarnation as this downward journey

28:34.540 --> 28:36.820
 in order to get all of us, right?

28:36.820 --> 28:40.820
 All of us who were stuck, were stuck in our sin.

28:40.820 --> 28:44.220
 And so again, Paul says he became sin on the cross.

28:44.220 --> 28:46.740
 It's a really, really powerful idea.

28:46.740 --> 28:49.460
 He wasn't a sinner, because then he'd need to be saved too.

28:49.460 --> 28:53.380
 He's not a sinner, but he entered into our dysfunction

28:53.380 --> 28:55.700
 in order to pull us back out of it.

28:55.700 --> 29:00.700
 So that's a really powerful message, an embodiment,

29:02.100 --> 29:05.060
 sort of educating the world about sin.

29:07.020 --> 29:09.180
 That said, day to day,

29:09.180 --> 29:14.180
 there's oscillations in terms of how much each human sins,

29:15.580 --> 29:17.980
 and there's a struggle against that.

29:17.980 --> 29:22.980
 So that dog that loses himself on the beach

29:22.980 --> 29:26.860
 may have had a lot of sex with other dogs leading up to that.

29:26.860 --> 29:30.580
 That was, may have been not the best dog

29:30.580 --> 29:32.540
 he could be leading up to that.

29:32.540 --> 29:35.540
 So how, if it's a math equation,

29:35.540 --> 29:38.780
 what does the final calculation look like

29:38.780 --> 29:40.940
 in terms of ending up in heaven?

29:40.940 --> 29:44.580
 What does it mean to live a good life in the end?

29:44.580 --> 29:49.580
 Is it the average amount of sin you do is low?

29:50.100 --> 29:52.380
 Are you allowed to make mistakes?

29:52.380 --> 29:56.900
 Yeah, the metric is love, right?

29:56.900 --> 29:59.860
 And love is not a feeling, it's an act of the will.

29:59.860 --> 30:01.580
 To will the good of the other.

30:01.580 --> 30:02.540
 That's Aquinas again.

30:02.540 --> 30:04.860
 To will the good of the other as other.

30:04.860 --> 30:07.540
 You see, that's the anti black hole principle.

30:07.540 --> 30:08.980
 When I, I don't.

30:08.980 --> 30:10.500
 Will the good of the other.

30:10.500 --> 30:11.340
 As other.

30:11.340 --> 30:13.380
 See, because if I'm willing your good,

30:13.380 --> 30:15.020
 because it's good for me.

30:15.020 --> 30:17.940
 So again, it's good for you that I'm on this program,

30:17.940 --> 30:19.140
 I guess, I'm willing your good,

30:19.140 --> 30:21.700
 but that's because it's gonna be down to my benefit.

30:21.700 --> 30:23.940
 That's just an indirect egotism.

30:23.940 --> 30:26.500
 That's why I see love is really rare and strange,

30:26.500 --> 30:31.500
 that I really want what's good for you as other.

30:32.340 --> 30:34.860
 So not connected to the black hole tendency

30:34.860 --> 30:36.700
 of my own prideful ego.

30:36.700 --> 30:39.940
 When I've broken that, I've forgotten self

30:39.940 --> 30:43.020
 and I've moved into the space of your own good.

30:43.020 --> 30:44.220
 That's what love is.

30:44.220 --> 30:46.700
 Now, God wants us to be,

30:46.700 --> 30:48.780
 by this they will know that you're my disciples,

30:48.780 --> 30:50.460
 that you love one another, Jesus says.

30:50.460 --> 30:52.220
 So that's it.

30:52.220 --> 30:56.140
 Now, I mean, life is ups and downs and back and forth

30:56.140 --> 30:57.980
 and we're better or worse at that.

30:59.820 --> 31:02.500
 The point of a church is to graft us onto Christ

31:02.500 --> 31:05.100
 that we might become more and more conformed to love.

31:05.100 --> 31:07.220
 But you know, the final calculus, I'll leave that to God.

31:07.220 --> 31:09.820
 I mean, but use love as the metric.

31:09.820 --> 31:12.660
 At the end of the day, when you examine your conscience,

31:12.660 --> 31:14.860
 did I will the good of the other today?

31:14.860 --> 31:17.380
 How effective was I at that?

31:17.380 --> 31:21.220
 And be, just like Ignatius of Loyola, be brutally honest.

31:21.220 --> 31:22.660
 Or was I just willing someone's good

31:22.660 --> 31:24.020
 because it was good for me?

31:25.500 --> 31:27.540
 Where were those moments where I was like the dog

31:27.540 --> 31:29.380
 on the beach, see?

31:29.380 --> 31:30.780
 And then see, play it the way,

31:30.780 --> 31:33.580
 not so much God the law giver surveying

31:33.580 --> 31:35.740
 and you did three of those and four.

31:35.740 --> 31:39.220
 It's God wants us to be fully alive.

31:39.220 --> 31:41.100
 Saint Irenaeus is one of my great heroes,

31:41.100 --> 31:43.140
 ancient, you know, patristic figure.

31:43.140 --> 31:46.420
 And his famous line is gloria de homo vivens, right?

31:46.420 --> 31:50.820
 The glory of God is a human being fully alive.

31:50.820 --> 31:53.620
 See, and that gets us over this sort of obsession

31:53.620 --> 31:55.860
 with the illegalism and did I do enough?

31:55.860 --> 31:58.140
 And is that, that's a big enough sin.

31:58.140 --> 32:00.260
 God wants us fully alive.

32:00.260 --> 32:02.700
 The key to that is willing the good of the other.

32:02.700 --> 32:07.260
 He died that we might come to a richer

32:07.260 --> 32:08.740
 appropriation of that.

32:08.740 --> 32:13.740
 So to be fully alive is to be in love with the world

32:13.740 --> 32:17.900
 or to love the world deeply.

32:17.900 --> 32:20.860
 And what love means is the other.

32:20.860 --> 32:21.700
 Is.

32:21.700 --> 32:22.540
 Get out of yourself, right.

32:22.540 --> 32:26.020
 It's the humility, yeah, getting out of yourself.

32:26.020 --> 32:26.860
 Let go.

32:26.860 --> 32:31.340
 That somehow is not, that's not even selfless

32:31.340 --> 32:35.460
 because the word selfless requires there to be a self.

32:35.460 --> 32:38.140
 It's almost like just letting go.

32:38.140 --> 32:39.980
 Yeah, I might talk about like a gift of self

32:39.980 --> 32:43.940
 that you're self aware but you give a gift of yourself.

32:43.940 --> 32:46.780
 Your self becomes not a magnet drawing things into itself

32:46.780 --> 32:49.740
 but it becomes a radiant source of life for others.

32:49.740 --> 32:51.460
 I think Mother Teresa would have had a keen sense

32:51.460 --> 32:52.700
 of herself, it seems to me.

32:52.700 --> 32:57.020
 But it was to light other people up

32:57.020 --> 33:00.100
 so that they might be radiant.

33:00.100 --> 33:00.940
 That's the game.

33:00.940 --> 33:03.980
 So you could probably articulate it that way too.

33:03.980 --> 33:05.460
 Yeah.

33:05.460 --> 33:06.540
 I love love.

33:06.540 --> 33:08.380
 It's such an interesting thing.

33:08.380 --> 33:09.620
 But we have to be hard nosed about it.

33:09.620 --> 33:11.460
 Like your friend Dostoevsky,

33:11.460 --> 33:13.780
 love is a harsh and dreadful thing, right.

33:13.780 --> 33:14.940
 It's not a feeling.

33:14.940 --> 33:17.140
 And our culture is so sentimentalized love

33:17.140 --> 33:20.020
 that it's having warm feelings or doing what people want.

33:20.020 --> 33:20.860
 And that's not it at all.

33:20.860 --> 33:24.500
 Love is always correlated to the order of the good.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.420
 Because if I'm willing the good of the other,

33:26.420 --> 33:28.660
 I have to know what that good is, right.

33:28.660 --> 33:30.340
 So a parent does this, oh, I'll give the kid

33:30.340 --> 33:31.540
 whatever she wants.

33:31.540 --> 33:33.380
 Well, that's not love, that's indulgence

33:33.380 --> 33:35.540
 or that's sentimentality.

33:35.540 --> 33:37.920
 But I have to know what the goods really are

33:37.920 --> 33:39.940
 if I'm gonna will them for you, right.

33:39.940 --> 33:43.020
 Yeah, in some sense, you're absolutely right.

33:43.020 --> 33:47.220
 A component of love is the struggle to know the other.

33:47.220 --> 33:48.060
 Right.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.620
 It's the struggle to understand.

33:49.620 --> 33:52.020
 I mean, that's what I mean by empathy.

33:52.020 --> 33:57.020
 It's the, yeah, it's not Valentine's Day romantic gifts.

33:57.180 --> 33:59.700
 It's a struggle.

33:59.700 --> 34:02.540
 It's like trying to understand,

34:02.540 --> 34:04.440
 trying to perturb your own mind

34:04.440 --> 34:06.880
 and that of another human being

34:06.880 --> 34:09.180
 to try to figure out who they are,

34:09.180 --> 34:12.820
 what they want, what makes them happy,

34:12.820 --> 34:16.340
 what are they afraid of, what are they hoping for.

34:16.340 --> 34:19.620
 And it's like a dance, a dance of conversation,

34:19.620 --> 34:23.700
 a dance of just shared experiences

34:23.700 --> 34:24.620
 and all that kind of stuff.

34:24.620 --> 34:26.620
 And all of that requires for you to be,

34:27.660 --> 34:31.300
 I guess, yeah, empathize.

34:31.300 --> 34:35.900
 Imagine yourself in their place

34:35.900 --> 34:38.220
 and then love that person

34:38.220 --> 34:40.900
 when you're living inside that person.

34:40.900 --> 34:42.460
 Yeah, several minutes ago

34:42.460 --> 34:43.780
 about the pillars of Christianity.

34:43.780 --> 34:45.540
 So we talked about God, talked about incarnation,

34:45.540 --> 34:48.580
 but you're getting now to a third key one,

34:48.580 --> 34:50.060
 namely the Trinity.

34:50.060 --> 34:52.540
 Because we're monotheists, right,

34:52.540 --> 34:54.900
 but we don't think God is monolithically one.

34:54.900 --> 34:57.380
 We think God is a play of persons.

34:57.380 --> 35:01.780
 And the Father from all eternity

35:01.780 --> 35:06.780
 by a great mental act forms his interior word,

35:07.220 --> 35:08.820
 as Aquinas puts it.

35:08.820 --> 35:10.060
 And that's the logos, right?

35:10.060 --> 35:12.020
 That's the verbum, that's the word

35:12.020 --> 35:13.420
 by which the Father knows himself.

35:13.420 --> 35:14.780
 And we call it the Son.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.100
 So the imago, it's the image of the Father.

35:17.100 --> 35:18.540
 But then see, the great thing is

35:18.540 --> 35:21.940
 that imago is not like just a dead image on a mirror

35:21.940 --> 35:24.180
 or a dead image at a pond or something.

35:24.180 --> 35:29.180
 It's a full reflection of the Father's being.

35:29.180 --> 35:31.580
 He's one in being with the Father.

35:31.580 --> 35:33.900
 Therefore, the Son has everything the Father has

35:33.900 --> 35:35.420
 except being the Father.

35:35.420 --> 35:38.820
 But that means that the two of them look at each other

35:38.820 --> 35:41.540
 and they're just crazy in love with each other

35:41.540 --> 35:44.980
 because the Father's the fullness of being,

35:44.980 --> 35:46.660
 the Son is the fullness of being.

35:46.660 --> 35:49.260
 And they're so crazy in love with each other that they,

35:49.260 --> 35:52.100
 this is Fulton Sheen put it this way,

35:52.100 --> 35:54.980
 that there's this, ah, they just,

35:54.980 --> 35:58.140
 they love each other with this sigh.

35:58.140 --> 36:00.220
 And we call that the Spiritus Sanctus.

36:00.220 --> 36:01.500
 That's the holy breath, right?

36:01.500 --> 36:06.140
 The holy sigh of love between the Father and the Son.

36:06.140 --> 36:10.580
 And that's one being, one essence we say of God.

36:10.580 --> 36:12.540
 But in these three persons,

36:12.540 --> 36:14.220
 but all your language about like dance

36:14.220 --> 36:16.820
 and play and community,

36:16.820 --> 36:18.780
 the Greek Fathers talked about perichoresis,

36:18.780 --> 36:21.100
 which means God, the three persons kind of sit

36:21.100 --> 36:23.180
 in a choir together.

36:23.180 --> 36:27.820
 So they sing together, you know?

36:27.820 --> 36:32.300
 And that's why, see, Christianity is unique in this claim,

36:32.300 --> 36:34.860
 that God is love.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.140
 So every religion will say God loves,

36:37.140 --> 36:38.100
 you know, in some way.

36:38.100 --> 36:40.420
 Love is an attribute of God.

36:40.420 --> 36:43.220
 God is, or love is a thing that God does sometimes.

36:43.220 --> 36:45.300
 But Christianity is unique in all the religions

36:45.300 --> 36:47.740
 in saying that God is love.

36:47.740 --> 36:52.060
 And somehow the Holy Trinity embodies that idea.

36:52.060 --> 36:56.740
 I mean, that philosophically has always been confusing to me,

36:56.740 --> 37:00.980
 what it means to be three things

37:00.980 --> 37:04.700
 and at the same time be one God,

37:04.700 --> 37:07.860
 the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.

37:07.860 --> 37:10.580
 What is this dance between these three?

37:10.580 --> 37:13.500
 What exact, like how do you visualize,

37:13.500 --> 37:15.020
 how do you understand this?

37:15.020 --> 37:15.860
 Yeah.

37:15.860 --> 37:20.180
 This very fascinating, essential thing for Christianity.

37:20.180 --> 37:21.540
 The first thing I'd say is what we already

37:21.540 --> 37:22.500
 have been sort of talking about,

37:22.500 --> 37:24.140
 is if you say God is love,

37:24.140 --> 37:25.980
 and most people probably say, yeah, I like that.

37:25.980 --> 37:27.300
 It's a good idea, God is love.

37:27.300 --> 37:30.980
 But it's very peculiar because if he is love,

37:30.980 --> 37:35.980
 there has to be in his unity a lover, a beloved,

37:36.500 --> 37:37.660
 and the love that they share.

37:37.660 --> 37:40.340
 Otherwise he isn't loved by his very essence.

37:40.340 --> 37:43.980
 He would love, it would be an attribute of God

37:43.980 --> 37:45.020
 or an action of God.

37:45.020 --> 37:46.820
 But if it's his very nature,

37:46.820 --> 37:49.820
 there has to be lover, beloved, and love shared.

37:49.820 --> 37:52.580
 And the tradition eventually came to see that.

37:52.580 --> 37:55.260
 The image I was using before of the Father,

37:55.260 --> 38:00.260
 his imago, the Son, well that's born of God's infinite mind.

38:00.260 --> 38:02.260
 So of course God has an image of himself.

38:02.260 --> 38:04.100
 Heck, I've got an image of myself.

38:04.100 --> 38:07.140
 That's something I can pull off as a puny little creature.

38:07.140 --> 38:11.500
 God in his infinity has a perfect imago of himself.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.540
 And they have to fall in love with each other.

38:13.540 --> 38:14.900
 What else can they do?

38:14.900 --> 38:17.900
 Because they're in the presence of infinite good.

38:17.900 --> 38:20.820
 And so it has to follow that you then have

38:20.820 --> 38:22.860
 the shared love that connects them.

38:22.860 --> 38:24.460
 And that's how we generate, if you want,

38:24.460 --> 38:26.920
 this idea of the three persons in God.

38:27.980 --> 38:30.940
 Let me ask you about the church.

38:30.940 --> 38:34.020
 One of the defining characteristics of Catholicism

38:35.460 --> 38:37.020
 is the Catholic church.

38:38.020 --> 38:39.740
 What is the Catholic church?

38:40.700 --> 38:43.060
 I would say it's the mystical body of Jesus.

38:43.060 --> 38:45.380
 So as I said before, it's not an organization.

38:45.380 --> 38:46.820
 If we do it that way, we're gonna miss it.

38:46.820 --> 38:48.900
 It's got organizational elements to it.

38:48.900 --> 38:52.980
 So I'm a bishop, I'm a office holder within the church.

38:52.980 --> 38:56.940
 But the church is an organism, not an organization.

38:56.940 --> 39:01.340
 So it's a organism of interconnected cells, as I said,

39:01.340 --> 39:02.660
 namely all of the baptized,

39:02.660 --> 39:06.620
 gathered around Christ in a mystical union.

39:06.620 --> 39:07.940
 That's the church.

39:07.940 --> 39:10.420
 But there's buildings, there's titles.

39:10.420 --> 39:14.180
 Sure, because it manifests itself institutionally then.

39:14.180 --> 39:18.180
 So are the sort of heavy things about that

39:18.180 --> 39:19.900
 all have to do with pride?

39:19.900 --> 39:20.740
 Yeah, sure.

39:20.740 --> 39:22.540
 The sexiness of the buildings?

39:22.540 --> 39:24.300
 Yeah, no, whatever is corrupt in the church,

39:24.300 --> 39:26.660
 of course, it comes from pride, from sin.

39:26.660 --> 39:28.620
 And one thing I like about the New Testament

39:28.620 --> 39:29.900
 is so clear on that.

39:29.900 --> 39:32.260
 Paul is, in his little tiny communities,

39:32.260 --> 39:35.060
 so before there was a Vatican or dioceses or anything,

39:35.060 --> 39:36.920
 Paul had these little tiny communities of Christians

39:36.920 --> 39:38.780
 like in Corinth and Ephesus.

39:39.860 --> 39:41.020
 What's the one thing we know about them?

39:41.020 --> 39:42.620
 Is they fought with each other.

39:42.620 --> 39:44.660
 Because Paul's always uprating them

39:44.660 --> 39:48.300
 and telling them, come on, would you people get it together?

39:48.300 --> 39:49.980
 Who's bewitched you?

39:49.980 --> 39:52.580
 So from the beginning, we've been fighting with each other

39:52.580 --> 39:54.220
 because we're made up of sinners.

39:55.860 --> 39:59.020
 So one thing we do in Catholic ecclesiology

39:59.020 --> 40:00.980
 is the official name for the study of the church,

40:00.980 --> 40:04.700
 is to talk about the treasure in earthen vessels.

40:04.700 --> 40:05.880
 Paul's language again.

40:05.880 --> 40:07.060
 The treasure is Christ.

40:07.060 --> 40:11.140
 The treasure is the love he's bequeathed to the world.

40:11.140 --> 40:12.820
 That's the treasure that we have.

40:12.820 --> 40:15.440
 But it's always held in these really fragile vessels,

40:15.440 --> 40:18.300
 namely us, and so it's gonna be marked by corruption

40:18.300 --> 40:21.260
 and stupidity and pride and everything else.

40:21.260 --> 40:23.900
 Well, nevertheless, there's a hierarchy.

40:23.900 --> 40:25.760
 There's titles and so on.

40:26.820 --> 40:28.920
 If we remove pride from the picture,

40:28.920 --> 40:31.940
 so the best possible interpretation of the hierarchy

40:31.940 --> 40:36.300
 that makes up this one organism, this living organism,

40:36.300 --> 40:39.860
 what's the role of the pope, for example?

40:39.860 --> 40:44.540
 What is the role of a bishop, for example?

40:44.540 --> 40:46.220
 What is the role of the hierarchy

40:46.220 --> 40:49.900
 in terms of the broader vision of Christianity,

40:49.900 --> 40:51.560
 Catholicism as a religion?

40:52.560 --> 40:54.900
 I'm a devotee of this guy named Johann Adam Müller,

40:54.900 --> 40:57.600
 who was a theologian early part of the 19th century,

40:57.600 --> 41:00.420
 and he was part of the kind of romantic movement.

41:00.420 --> 41:04.860
 And he said the purpose of the pope is to symbolize

41:04.860 --> 41:09.860
 and embody and draw together the unity of the entire church.

41:10.740 --> 41:14.060
 So he's the personal symbol of the unity of the church.

41:14.060 --> 41:15.080
 Who's a bishop?

41:15.080 --> 41:17.280
 The bishop is the personal symbol

41:17.280 --> 41:19.500
 of the unity of a diocese.

41:19.500 --> 41:20.940
 Who's a pastor of a parish?

41:20.940 --> 41:24.440
 He's the personal symbol of the unity of that parish.

41:24.440 --> 41:27.380
 So he understood it not so much organizationally

41:27.380 --> 41:28.540
 as organically, again.

41:28.540 --> 41:32.460
 It was like, what, that around which the pattern

41:32.460 --> 41:34.340
 organizes itself.

41:34.340 --> 41:37.380
 And if you don't have that unifying figure,

41:37.380 --> 41:39.300
 the community will kind of reciprocate.

41:39.300 --> 41:40.480
 And you see that all the time.

41:40.480 --> 41:43.060
 Without headship, we would say.

41:43.060 --> 41:45.160
 So it's more symbolic and organic

41:45.160 --> 41:47.460
 than it is organizational.

41:47.460 --> 41:49.020
 So symbols for community.

41:49.020 --> 41:52.980
 But there's such fascinating peculiarities

41:52.980 --> 41:55.360
 to each individual symbol.

41:55.360 --> 41:56.700
 There's different characteristics

41:56.700 --> 41:58.780
 that make up the different people.

41:58.780 --> 42:01.340
 They have different ways of communicating.

42:01.340 --> 42:02.740
 They have different hopes and fears

42:02.740 --> 42:04.140
 and all that kind of stuff.

42:06.500 --> 42:08.220
 If they're all symbols,

42:08.220 --> 42:13.220
 what's the role of the different peculiarities

42:13.580 --> 42:14.860
 of those symbols?

42:14.860 --> 42:19.860
 Of being an inspiring uniter versus maybe a stronger type

42:20.220 --> 42:25.220
 of more judgmental kind of communicator,

42:26.860 --> 42:27.820
 all that kind of stuff.

42:27.820 --> 42:32.820
 Can you maybe speak to the human part of these symbols?

42:32.820 --> 42:37.160
 Yeah, well, I might just shift to another image of shepherd.

42:37.160 --> 42:38.960
 So that's a classic biblical image.

42:38.960 --> 42:40.760
 And as a bishop, I walk around with this thing

42:40.760 --> 42:43.040
 called a crozier, which is a shepherd's staff.

42:43.040 --> 42:45.680
 So it's the symbol of the bishop's office.

42:45.680 --> 42:50.360
 And the crozier, though, is a kind of in your face thing

42:50.360 --> 42:53.520
 in a way, because it's got the end of it

42:53.520 --> 42:55.960
 was meant to hold off wild animals.

42:55.960 --> 42:59.000
 And then the crook part of it was meant to bring sheep back

42:59.000 --> 43:00.320
 to the fold.

43:00.320 --> 43:01.760
 So I walk in with that, oh, this is nice.

43:01.760 --> 43:03.120
 Oh, look at the bishop coming in.

43:03.120 --> 43:05.800
 But that's a kind of in your face symbol

43:05.800 --> 43:09.920
 that I'm here to defend the church against predators.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.000
 And I'm also here to draw people in

43:12.000 --> 43:13.840
 who are wandering too far away.

43:13.840 --> 43:14.680
 So that's okay.

43:14.680 --> 43:17.120
 I mean, that's part of the role of the hierarchy

43:17.120 --> 43:20.320
 and the Pope and bishops and pastors.

43:20.320 --> 43:21.800
 Pastor just means shepherd, right?

43:21.800 --> 43:24.200
 So I'm the shepherd of a parish.

43:24.200 --> 43:25.040
 So that's okay.

43:25.040 --> 43:26.920
 It's not like just all sunshine and light

43:26.920 --> 43:28.320
 and what a pretty image.

43:28.320 --> 43:30.920
 The one who embodies the unity of the community

43:30.920 --> 43:31.920
 is also the shepherd.

43:32.920 --> 43:36.400
 Okay, but again, leaning on the human thing.

43:36.400 --> 43:37.560
 Yeah.

43:37.560 --> 43:39.360
 The church is an institution.

43:40.360 --> 43:42.360
 And I don't know if you've heard,

43:42.360 --> 43:46.160
 but there is an element of power that corrupts.

43:46.160 --> 43:48.640
 An absolute power corrupts absolutely,

43:48.640 --> 43:49.880
 as the old saying goes.

43:51.880 --> 43:53.680
 Let me ask you something else that came up

43:53.680 --> 43:56.080
 on the Reddit AMA.

43:56.080 --> 43:59.400
 Yeah, megachurches and the prosperity gospel.

43:59.400 --> 44:03.760
 And you've mentioned that you may not be a fan.

44:03.760 --> 44:05.000
 What are your views on this?

44:05.000 --> 44:08.120
 And what are your views in general of money and power

44:08.120 --> 44:10.800
 corrupting the heads of these institutions?

44:12.000 --> 44:13.760
 I don't like the prosperity gospel

44:13.760 --> 44:17.400
 because the gospel is about Jesus journey

44:17.400 --> 44:21.240
 into radical self forgetfulness on the cross.

44:21.240 --> 44:24.360
 And he never makes a promise of earthly,

44:24.360 --> 44:27.640
 of earthly well being.

44:27.640 --> 44:29.840
 Can you explain what the prosperity gospel is?

44:29.840 --> 44:31.800
 Yeah, the view that if I follow Jesus

44:31.800 --> 44:33.600
 and I follow God with great trust

44:33.600 --> 44:37.280
 that I will be rewarded with wealth and position

44:37.280 --> 44:39.160
 and status in this world.

44:39.160 --> 44:41.120
 It might be God's will when I get that.

44:41.120 --> 44:42.640
 But you know, Aquinas said this,

44:42.640 --> 44:44.240
 say I look at a very sinful person,

44:44.240 --> 44:45.680
 I say, kind of, he's got a great house

44:45.680 --> 44:47.720
 and he's richer than I am and all that.

44:47.720 --> 44:51.120
 Aquinas says, yeah, but maybe that's a punishment.

44:51.120 --> 44:53.480
 Cause maybe all that is leading him away from God.

44:53.480 --> 44:55.320
 And actually that's God's way of punishing him.

44:55.320 --> 44:57.560
 And the fact that you don't have wealth in a big house

44:57.560 --> 44:59.160
 is actually a great gift to you

44:59.160 --> 45:02.440
 because now it frees you for doing God's will.

45:02.440 --> 45:07.440
 So we can't read, you know, God's favor in worldly terms.

45:08.480 --> 45:13.120
 I would say God's favor is, am I awakened to deeper love?

45:13.120 --> 45:15.360
 Then I know that I'm finding God's favor.

45:15.360 --> 45:17.080
 Now, God might decide, sure,

45:17.080 --> 45:18.600
 I want you to have this and that.

45:18.600 --> 45:20.120
 I want to provide this to you.

45:20.120 --> 45:20.960
 Fine.

45:20.960 --> 45:21.920
 Then I say, thank you, Lord.

45:21.920 --> 45:24.200
 How can I use it as an instrument of love?

45:25.840 --> 45:27.800
 All the masters talk about detachment.

45:27.800 --> 45:29.680
 And that's another reason I don't like the prosperity gospel

45:29.680 --> 45:31.680
 is though I'm getting attached now

45:31.680 --> 45:34.040
 to all these material advantages.

45:34.040 --> 45:37.280
 And I'm even seeing them as a sign of God's favor.

45:37.280 --> 45:38.360
 Let go of all that.

45:38.360 --> 45:41.040
 You let go of it and use it as a vehicle of love.

45:41.040 --> 45:43.360
 So if you're rich, the right question is,

45:43.360 --> 45:46.240
 okay, Lord, why did you allow me to become rich?

45:46.240 --> 45:47.640
 So that, what can I do?

45:47.640 --> 45:50.000
 How can my riches be an expression of love?

45:50.000 --> 45:52.360
 If I'm popular, if I'm healthy,

45:52.360 --> 45:53.640
 okay, why am I popular?

45:53.640 --> 45:54.480
 Why am I healthy?

45:54.480 --> 45:56.640
 How can I use that for your good?

45:56.640 --> 45:59.920
 I'm sick, in bed, I'm suffering.

45:59.920 --> 46:03.480
 Okay, Lord, how can I use that as an expression of love?

46:03.480 --> 46:05.480
 So I'd rather measure it that way

46:05.480 --> 46:07.540
 than through worldly success.

46:07.540 --> 46:10.000
 That's why I'm against the prosperity gospel.

46:10.000 --> 46:10.840
 Okay.

46:10.840 --> 46:15.600
 So there's a, don't seek worldly possessions,

46:15.600 --> 46:19.280
 but whatever happens to you, good or bad,

46:19.280 --> 46:21.860
 seek how that could be used

46:21.860 --> 46:23.940
 to increase the amount of love in the world.

46:23.940 --> 46:24.780
 Right.

46:24.780 --> 46:27.320
 The image I love for this is the Wheel of Fortune,

46:27.320 --> 46:29.840
 which is a device on a lot of the Gothic cathedrals.

46:29.840 --> 46:32.400
 And it's this great circle, right, this wheel.

46:32.400 --> 46:34.280
 At the top of it is a king.

46:34.280 --> 46:35.200
 And then it turns this way,

46:35.200 --> 46:36.520
 and the king has lost his crown.

46:36.520 --> 46:37.920
 And the bottom is a pauper.

46:37.920 --> 46:39.600
 And then over here is a king,

46:39.600 --> 46:42.520
 is a guy climbing up to power, right?

46:42.520 --> 46:45.740
 And then in the middle is a depiction of Christ.

46:45.740 --> 46:47.720
 And the idea is just very simple, but very profound,

46:47.720 --> 46:49.400
 that the wheel is life, you know?

46:49.400 --> 46:51.880
 It's sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down.

46:51.880 --> 46:55.160
 Sometimes you have power and popularity and prestige.

46:55.160 --> 46:56.760
 Other times you're losing it, you're going down.

46:56.760 --> 46:57.940
 Other times you got none of it.

46:57.940 --> 46:59.440
 Other times you're coming back up.

46:59.440 --> 47:00.280
 Okay.

47:00.280 --> 47:01.840
 Don't live on the rim of the wheel.

47:01.840 --> 47:02.840
 It'll make you crazy.

47:02.840 --> 47:06.240
 Every point on the rim of the wheel is a point of anxiety.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.240
 Where you should live is the center of the wheel,

47:08.240 --> 47:10.040
 where Christ is, right?

47:10.040 --> 47:13.320
 Because that's the link now to the eternity of God.

47:13.320 --> 47:15.640
 That's the point of love,

47:15.640 --> 47:17.560
 where love can flow through you to the world.

47:17.560 --> 47:19.920
 And then you can look at the wheel.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.220
 You're a Beatles fan, right?

47:21.220 --> 47:22.060
 I think I discovered that.

47:22.060 --> 47:23.320
 I love the Beatles.

47:23.320 --> 47:25.520
 And the song that always comes to my mind

47:25.520 --> 47:27.800
 when I think of that image is John Lennon,

47:27.800 --> 47:28.800
 the end of his life.

47:29.680 --> 47:32.920
 So a guy that, I mean, rode the wheel of fortune like crazy.

47:32.920 --> 47:36.480
 You know, he was at the top of the world in every way.

47:36.480 --> 47:39.060
 And then Beatles break up and he kind of loses it.

47:39.060 --> 47:41.360
 And then he's at the lost weekend in the 70s

47:41.360 --> 47:42.600
 at the very bottom.

47:42.600 --> 47:45.300
 When he died, he was just kind of coming back up again.

47:45.300 --> 47:48.280
 But the song I always think of is watching the wheels,

47:48.280 --> 47:49.120
 right?

47:49.120 --> 47:50.280
 I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round.

47:50.280 --> 47:51.800
 I really love to watch them roll

47:51.800 --> 47:54.420
 because I'm no longer riding on the merry go round.

47:54.420 --> 47:56.020
 That's right out of the medieval mystics,

47:56.020 --> 47:59.280
 that he's not riding on the wheel.

47:59.280 --> 48:01.360
 He's just watching it go round and round.

48:01.360 --> 48:04.560
 That's the point of, the Greeks called it apotheia,

48:04.560 --> 48:08.960
 and the Latins called it indifference, you know?

48:08.960 --> 48:12.640
 Not like I'm blasé, it just means I'm detached

48:12.640 --> 48:16.880
 from success, failure, less success, more success.

48:16.880 --> 48:18.160
 I'm detached from that.

48:18.160 --> 48:20.660
 I'm sitting here watching the wheel go round and round

48:20.660 --> 48:22.600
 because I'm not riding on it anymore.

48:22.600 --> 48:25.640
 The mystics have always made that transition.

48:25.640 --> 48:27.840
 Let me ask you a difficult question

48:27.840 --> 48:29.960
 about the darker side of human nature,

48:29.960 --> 48:34.440
 of human power, of institutions.

48:34.440 --> 48:36.120
 What's your view on the long history

48:36.120 --> 48:39.680
 and widespread reports of sexual abuse of children

48:39.680 --> 48:40.840
 by a Catholic priest?

48:40.840 --> 48:43.000
 So this is a difficult topic,

48:43.000 --> 48:45.480
 but maybe an important one to shine a light on.

48:45.480 --> 48:48.440
 Yeah, it's awful, you know, and it's been a problem.

48:48.440 --> 48:51.200
 Go back to Peter Damian back in the 11th century

48:51.200 --> 48:52.320
 was talking about it.

48:52.320 --> 48:54.980
 So it's been a problem, and whenever really sinful

48:54.980 --> 48:57.440
 human beings have been in close proximity to children,

48:57.440 --> 48:59.360
 we find this issue.

48:59.360 --> 49:00.520
 Has it been around the church?

49:00.520 --> 49:01.360
 Yes.

49:03.320 --> 49:06.000
 Has it surfaced in a kind of sickening way

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
 in the last 30 years?

49:07.000 --> 49:07.900
 Absolutely.

49:07.900 --> 49:12.560
 So I'm glad the church has made important strides,

49:12.560 --> 49:13.880
 and it has.

49:13.880 --> 49:16.840
 Back in 2002, there was a thing called the Dallas Accords

49:16.840 --> 49:18.400
 where the bishops of America

49:18.400 --> 49:20.400
 put a lot of these protocols in place

49:20.400 --> 49:22.640
 that really have been effective

49:22.640 --> 49:24.800
 at ameliorating this problem.

49:24.800 --> 49:27.360
 The numbers spiked in the 70s and 80s,

49:27.360 --> 49:29.360
 and that's been demonstrated over and over again.

49:29.360 --> 49:31.440
 And then they fell dramatically after that.

49:31.440 --> 49:33.760
 So that's not to excuse anything,

49:33.760 --> 49:36.360
 but it's to say I think progress has been made with it.

49:36.360 --> 49:38.920
 What's the impulse to secrecy?

49:38.920 --> 49:40.960
 Yeah, well, to protect institutions.

49:40.960 --> 49:43.520
 That's always, that's a sinful instinct.

49:43.520 --> 49:44.360
 I'm not all together.

49:44.360 --> 49:46.280
 I mean, sure, an institution is worth protecting,

49:46.280 --> 49:48.080
 but if it reaches the point where you're indifferent

49:48.080 --> 49:52.240
 to people's wellbeing, then you're in trouble.

49:52.240 --> 49:57.240
 So institutions role should be transparent and honest

49:57.400 --> 50:01.320
 with the sins of its members and of itself.

50:01.320 --> 50:02.320
 Sure, yeah.

50:02.320 --> 50:07.320
 So maybe you can speak to the fact as a priest, a bishop,

50:09.840 --> 50:14.840
 as part of Catholicism, you're not allowed to marry,

50:15.360 --> 50:20.360
 not allowed to have sex, you're sworn to celibacy.

50:22.360 --> 50:25.080
 What is behind that idea?

50:25.080 --> 50:28.080
 What is the sort of, we've talked about some broad stroke

50:28.080 --> 50:33.080
 ideas of love, what's behind the idea of celibacy?

50:33.520 --> 50:34.520
 And that's a good way to get at it.

50:34.520 --> 50:35.760
 It's a path of love.

50:35.760 --> 50:39.320
 So the church is always in favor of inculcating love.

50:39.320 --> 50:42.380
 Marriage is a path of love, but so is celibacy.

50:43.300 --> 50:46.520
 Saint Paul talks about someone who is preoccupied

50:46.520 --> 50:48.640
 with the things of this world and family

50:48.640 --> 50:50.720
 and those who are free from that

50:50.720 --> 50:53.440
 are freer for doing the work of God.

50:53.440 --> 50:56.320
 So that's kind of a pragmatic justification for celibacy.

50:56.320 --> 50:59.120
 And we still, I think, take that seriously.

50:59.120 --> 50:59.960
 I look at my own life.

50:59.960 --> 51:03.040
 I mean, celibacy has enabled me to do all kinds of things

51:03.040 --> 51:07.940
 and go places and minister in a way that I could not

51:07.940 --> 51:09.360
 if I had been married.

51:09.360 --> 51:11.260
 So I get it, I get the pragmatic side.

51:11.260 --> 51:14.540
 But I'm more interested in the sort of mystical side of it.

51:17.320 --> 51:18.960
 Remember Jesus was challenged about the person

51:18.960 --> 51:22.520
 who had a whole series of husbands and then they all died.

51:22.520 --> 51:26.760
 And so in heaven, which husband will the wife have?

51:26.760 --> 51:30.440
 And his answer is, in heaven, people don't marry

51:30.440 --> 51:31.520
 and they're not given in marriage.

51:31.520 --> 51:34.360
 There's a higher way of love.

51:34.360 --> 51:35.780
 It's a more radical way of love.

51:35.780 --> 51:37.560
 It's not tied to a particular,

51:37.560 --> 51:40.880
 but I think through God is tied to everybody.

51:40.880 --> 51:42.400
 The celibate, and this has been

51:42.400 --> 51:45.080
 to the beginning of the church, not as a law,

51:45.080 --> 51:46.600
 but there were celibates

51:46.600 --> 51:48.080
 from the very beginning of the church,

51:48.080 --> 51:50.480
 including Jesus, of course, and Paul.

51:50.480 --> 51:54.880
 They sense something, that that way of living

51:55.760 --> 51:58.780
 mystically anticipates the way we'll love in heaven.

51:58.780 --> 52:02.560
 It's a sign even now within this world

52:02.560 --> 52:04.800
 of how we will all love in heaven.

52:04.800 --> 52:08.640
 So in that way, it's a bit like pacifists.

52:10.120 --> 52:12.400
 I'm glad there are pacifists in the church.

52:12.400 --> 52:17.400
 And I've known some very powerful witnesses to pacifism.

52:17.400 --> 52:22.400
 I'm glad they're pacifists because they witness even now

52:22.420 --> 52:25.340
 to how we will be in heaven when every tear is wiped away

52:25.340 --> 52:26.940
 and we beat our swords into plowshares

52:26.940 --> 52:29.980
 and heaven's a place of radical peace,

52:29.980 --> 52:32.060
 that some people even now live it.

52:32.060 --> 52:35.100
 At the same time, I'm glad not everyone's a pacifist

52:35.100 --> 52:38.260
 because I would hold with the church to just war theory

52:38.260 --> 52:42.140
 that sometimes all we can do in this finite world

52:42.140 --> 52:45.580
 is to fight manifest wickedness.

52:45.580 --> 52:46.580
 So.

52:46.580 --> 52:48.700
 And just in the same way there's just sex?

52:49.660 --> 52:51.740
 Well, no, right, I'm glad there are celibates,

52:51.740 --> 52:53.620
 but I'm glad not everyone's a celibate.

52:53.620 --> 52:54.440
 I wouldn't want that.

52:54.440 --> 52:58.860
 I mean, because married love is a marvelous expression

52:58.860 --> 52:59.760
 of the divine love.

52:59.760 --> 53:01.980
 So that's why it's good there are some.

53:01.980 --> 53:03.740
 And it's always been a small number.

53:03.740 --> 53:06.500
 The actual experience of it, would you,

53:07.540 --> 53:10.780
 the spiritual nature of it, is it similar to fasting?

53:10.780 --> 53:15.000
 So I've been enjoying fasting recently, so not eating.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.120
 Yeah.

53:16.120 --> 53:18.860
 For several days, that kind of stuff.

53:18.860 --> 53:21.780
 And that somehow brings you even deeper.

53:21.780 --> 53:24.060
 I'm in general in love with everything,

53:24.060 --> 53:25.100
 with nature and everything.

53:25.100 --> 53:26.700
 I see the beauty in the world.

53:26.700 --> 53:29.660
 But there's a greater intensity to that

53:29.660 --> 53:31.640
 when you're fasting, for example.

53:31.640 --> 53:34.240
 Yeah, I might use the language of sublimation

53:34.240 --> 53:36.140
 or redirection of energy and all that.

53:37.100 --> 53:38.700
 I think that's true.

53:38.700 --> 53:43.700
 There's a certain sublimation of energies into prayer,

53:43.700 --> 53:48.700
 into mysticism, into ministry, a redirection of energies.

53:50.540 --> 53:52.740
 So it's meant to be life enhancing.

53:52.740 --> 53:53.860
 The same way fasting is.

53:53.860 --> 53:55.500
 It's meant ultimately to be life enhancing

53:55.500 --> 53:57.340
 and make you healthier and happier.

53:57.340 --> 54:00.060
 So celibacy is a path of love.

54:00.060 --> 54:01.940
 And I think it does involve a certain redirection

54:01.940 --> 54:03.460
 of energies, I'd say that.

54:03.460 --> 54:08.460
 Don't you think, do you think it's a heavy burden

54:08.900 --> 54:11.100
 for some humans to bear?

54:11.100 --> 54:11.940
 Sure.

54:11.940 --> 54:12.760
 For some priests to bear?

54:12.760 --> 54:13.600
 Sure.

54:13.600 --> 54:18.460
 I'm just saying, given the sexual abuse scandal,

54:19.900 --> 54:22.260
 is that the thing that breaks humans?

54:22.260 --> 54:24.260
 No, I wouldn't tie that to celibacy.

54:24.260 --> 54:27.380
 And that's been demonstrated over and over again.

54:27.380 --> 54:28.740
 There's a priest named Andrew Greeley

54:28.740 --> 54:30.820
 who was a priest from my home diocese of Chicago.

54:30.820 --> 54:32.980
 And Andy did a lot of research,

54:32.980 --> 54:34.220
 he was a sociologist of religion,

54:34.220 --> 54:36.120
 did a lot of research into that very question.

54:36.120 --> 54:37.780
 And there really is not a correlation

54:37.780 --> 54:40.940
 between celibacy per se and the sexual abuse

54:40.940 --> 54:42.760
 of children or of anybody.

54:42.760 --> 54:44.460
 So I wouldn't make that correlation.

54:44.460 --> 54:47.320
 So bad people, sinful people are going to do

54:47.320 --> 54:48.540
 what they're going to do.

54:48.540 --> 54:51.460
 I think people who have a tendency toward

54:52.860 --> 54:55.820
 abusing children sexually are drawn to situations

54:55.820 --> 54:58.540
 where they get ready access to kids

54:58.540 --> 55:00.740
 and they get institutional cover.

55:00.740 --> 55:03.220
 So that's the only thing that can go through the list

55:03.220 --> 55:06.020
 from sports and Boy Scouts, et cetera.

55:06.020 --> 55:08.000
 And that's been proven again and again.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.620
 So I would tie it more to that.

55:09.620 --> 55:11.140
 I wouldn't tie it to celibacy.

55:11.140 --> 55:13.420
 So the challenge of course is all kinds of,

55:13.420 --> 55:15.300
 you said institutional cover,

55:15.300 --> 55:17.820
 there's all kinds of institutions that cover

55:17.820 --> 55:22.740
 for people that do evil onto the world,

55:22.740 --> 55:25.540
 that do sinful things onto the world.

55:25.540 --> 55:27.180
 But there's something about the church

55:27.180 --> 55:32.180
 which is, as an organism, is supposed to be an embodiment

55:32.860 --> 55:35.800
 of good in this world, of love in this world.

55:35.800 --> 55:39.300
 And it breaks people's hearts to see this kind of,

55:39.300 --> 55:42.940
 even a small amount, this kind of thing happen

55:42.940 --> 55:43.780
 within the church.

55:43.780 --> 55:46.940
 It wakes you up to the cruelty, the absurdity

55:46.940 --> 55:48.340
 of the world sometimes.

55:48.340 --> 55:53.340
 Like it's back to the question of why do bad things

55:54.620 --> 55:56.740
 happen to good people?

55:56.740 --> 56:00.060
 Why does God allow this kind of thing to happen?

56:00.060 --> 56:02.540
 And sort of maybe an unanswerable question.

56:02.540 --> 56:04.220
 Do you have an answer to that question?

56:04.220 --> 56:08.000
 I can gesture toward it using rather abstract language,

56:08.000 --> 56:10.140
 which is true enough,

56:10.140 --> 56:12.860
 it's completely emotionally unsatisfying,

56:12.860 --> 56:15.420
 but it's naming it truthfully enough.

56:15.420 --> 56:16.920
 And it goes back to Augustine,

56:16.920 --> 56:21.920
 which is God permits evil to bring about a greater good.

56:24.060 --> 56:25.860
 Now again, I know how unsatisfying

56:25.860 --> 56:29.140
 that sort of spare, austere language can sound,

56:29.140 --> 56:32.340
 but it gets us off the horns of a dilemma.

56:32.340 --> 56:34.860
 Aquinas, when he lays out a question,

56:34.860 --> 56:36.980
 he always has the objections first.

56:36.980 --> 56:38.380
 So is there a God?

56:38.380 --> 56:40.860
 Well, objection one, objection two, objection three.

56:40.860 --> 56:43.100
 And he's really, you talk about steel manning

56:43.100 --> 56:45.100
 and argument, Aquinas is great at that.

56:46.300 --> 56:49.340
 One of the really steel manned arguments,

56:49.340 --> 56:51.460
 is that the right grammatical form?

56:51.460 --> 56:53.900
 What's the past participle of the steel man?

56:55.020 --> 56:58.940
 But one of the best arguments, he formulates it this way.

57:00.940 --> 57:03.400
 If one of two contraries be infinite,

57:03.400 --> 57:05.400
 the other would be altogether destroyed.

57:05.400 --> 57:08.480
 And as an example from his medieval physics,

57:08.480 --> 57:09.780
 he goes, if there were an infinite heat,

57:09.780 --> 57:11.520
 there'd be no cold, right?

57:11.520 --> 57:14.640
 But God is described as infinitely good.

57:15.820 --> 57:18.600
 Therefore, if God exists, there should be no evil.

57:18.600 --> 57:20.040
 But there is evil.

57:20.040 --> 57:22.040
 Therefore, God does not exist.

57:22.040 --> 57:23.440
 That's a darn good argument.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.120
 That's a really persuasive argument.

57:25.120 --> 57:27.900
 And I think, I've done this for a long time

57:27.900 --> 57:31.760
 in apologetics and in sort of higher philosophy,

57:31.760 --> 57:33.600
 that's the best argument against God.

57:33.600 --> 57:36.200
 But here's something, before I press head with it,

57:36.200 --> 57:37.720
 something I find really interesting.

57:37.720 --> 57:40.600
 I think the three best arguments against God

57:40.600 --> 57:43.480
 all come from within the religious tradition.

57:43.480 --> 57:45.160
 Namely, the book of Job.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.880
 So Job, he's great.

57:48.880 --> 57:50.240
 I mean, he's a great guy.

57:50.240 --> 57:51.560
 He does everything right.

57:51.560 --> 57:53.560
 He's God's great servant,

57:53.560 --> 57:57.360
 and he's punished in every possible way.

57:57.360 --> 57:59.720
 He has every possible suffering.

57:59.720 --> 58:01.840
 Aquinas's argument from the Summa,

58:01.840 --> 58:06.080
 from the Summa, and then to your friend and mine, Dostoevsky.

58:06.080 --> 58:10.160
 I think in the Brothers Karamazov, Ivan's argument,

58:10.160 --> 58:13.160
 when he's trying to wreck the faith of Alyosha.

58:13.160 --> 58:18.160
 And these examples drawn, they think, from Dostoevsky,

58:18.200 --> 58:20.560
 from the headlines of his own time,

58:20.560 --> 58:24.480
 of the most abject cruelty to children,

58:24.480 --> 58:27.920
 like an innocent child being made to suffer.

58:27.920 --> 58:32.040
 How in God's name could that happen

58:32.040 --> 58:34.400
 if God exists and he's all good?

58:34.400 --> 58:36.920
 So I get it, but see, the book of Job,

58:36.920 --> 58:38.360
 Thomas Aquinas, Dostoevsky,

58:38.360 --> 58:41.000
 these are all profoundly believing people.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.240
 It's like when I hear Stephen Fry,

58:43.240 --> 58:46.400
 the famously atheist writer,

58:46.400 --> 58:50.200
 he will bring out this argument with great authority.

58:50.200 --> 58:53.480
 He does, of children with bone cancer

58:53.480 --> 58:55.680
 and worms that go into the eyes of children

58:55.680 --> 58:57.240
 and blind them before they kill them.

58:57.240 --> 59:01.720
 And, but he's been preceded by the author of Job,

59:01.720 --> 59:05.960
 Thomas Aquinas and Dostoevsky, who stood right,

59:05.960 --> 59:08.880
 think of Job, in the whirlwind.

59:08.880 --> 59:12.080
 He stands there in the whirlwind, you know?

59:12.080 --> 59:15.360
 So you can't blame the Christian tradition

59:15.360 --> 59:17.440
 for not dealing with this problem,

59:17.440 --> 59:20.200
 for brushing it under the carpet.

59:20.200 --> 59:23.520
 I mean, it has stood in the whirlwind of this problem.

59:23.520 --> 59:25.560
 It's still a difficult problem to deal with,

59:25.560 --> 59:27.960
 that there's all this cruelty of the world.

59:29.760 --> 59:31.920
 There's a lot of example through history,

59:31.920 --> 59:36.800
 just in my own family history with the Soviet Union,

59:36.800 --> 59:41.800
 with Stalin, the atrocities that Stalin has brought onto

59:45.480 --> 59:47.000
 the people of the Soviet Union

59:47.000 --> 59:51.040
 throughout the 20th century is nearly immeasurable.

59:51.040 --> 59:56.040
 And yet, when you look at the entirety of human history,

59:57.120 --> 59:59.840
 you will see progress, not just the Soviet Union,

59:59.840 --> 1:00:01.440
 but the entirety of the civilization

1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:02.960
 throughout the 20th century,

1:00:02.960 --> 1:00:04.840
 and Stalin has a role to play.

1:00:05.760 --> 1:00:08.880
 There's a dark aspect to,

1:00:08.880 --> 1:00:13.880
 somehow evil helps us make progress.

1:00:14.720 --> 1:00:18.440
 And I don't know how to put that in the calculation.

1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:21.800
 It's a, I don't, you know, on the local scale,

1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:23.680
 I want to alleviate suffering.

1:00:23.680 --> 1:00:28.680
 I'm probably lean, heavily lean pacifist.

1:00:29.360 --> 1:00:31.400
 Not out of weakness, but out of strength,

1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:36.400
 but man, it does seem that history is sprinkled with evil,

1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:41.320
 and that evil does somehow nudge us towards good.

1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:44.160
 Yes, sometimes we can see it,

1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:46.560
 and that's where the idea comes from,

1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:49.840
 that evil's permitted to bring about some greater good,

1:00:49.840 --> 1:00:52.320
 and we can sometimes really see it.

1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:54.880
 Can we always see it?

1:00:54.880 --> 1:00:55.720
 No.

1:00:55.720 --> 1:00:57.320
 In fact, typically we don't see it,

1:00:57.320 --> 1:00:59.160
 but now you bring another factor into this,

1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:02.840
 which is the difference between our minds and God's mind.

1:01:02.840 --> 1:01:04.560
 So our minds, I mean, look, even,

1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:06.120
 they're remarkably capacious,

1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:11.120
 but they take in a tiny, tiny, tiny swath of space and time,

1:01:11.720 --> 1:01:13.880
 and even our eyes kind of take in

1:01:13.880 --> 1:01:15.000
 so much of the light spectrum,

1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:18.120
 and these little ape sensorium that we have

1:01:18.120 --> 1:01:22.600
 that could just take in a little tiny bit of reality, really.

1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:25.440
 How are we ever in a position to say,

1:01:25.440 --> 1:01:26.720
 oh no, there's no possible good

1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:28.160
 that would ever come from that?

1:01:28.160 --> 1:01:32.600
 Even the greatest evil that Dostoevsky can conjure up,

1:01:32.600 --> 1:01:37.600
 and Stephen Fry, still, how could we have the arrogance

1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:41.280
 to say, I know there's no good

1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:42.480
 that could ever come from that.

1:01:42.480 --> 1:01:45.640
 I know there's no morally justifiable reason

1:01:45.640 --> 1:01:47.280
 why God would ever permit that,

1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:50.120
 because I think that's hubris to the nth degree

1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:51.760
 for us to say that,

1:01:51.760 --> 1:01:54.200
 and that's the assumption behind this claim

1:01:54.200 --> 1:01:57.600
 that God can permit evil to bring about a greater good.

1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:00.040
 Now, God understands it,

1:02:00.040 --> 1:02:04.720
 but we're like little kids, like a four year old,

1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:06.240
 and their parents make a decision,

1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:08.360
 and we say, what in the, why in the world

1:02:08.360 --> 1:02:09.560
 would you do this to me?

1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:12.240
 This is my pastoral experience.

1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:14.320
 Years ago, there was a young father,

1:02:14.320 --> 1:02:16.440
 and his son was like three or something,

1:02:16.440 --> 1:02:18.560
 and he was in the hospital for something,

1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:19.400
 I forgot what it was,

1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:21.400
 but he had to undergo surgery, right?

1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:23.640
 So after the surgery, he's in great pain,

1:02:23.640 --> 1:02:25.600
 this poor kid, this three year old kid,

1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:28.800
 and the dad was there with him, holding his hand,

1:02:28.800 --> 1:02:31.680
 and the son, this is what the father told me,

1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:35.600
 he said, he's looking at me like, what gives here?

1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:37.800
 I mean, why would you, you love me,

1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:40.160
 I've always assumed that,

1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:42.120
 and yet you're presiding over this somehow,

1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:43.760
 you're approving of this,

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:46.480
 and doing nothing to get me out of it, right?

1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:48.400
 And he said, the kid couldn't articulate that,

1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:51.560
 but his eyes did, and the father said,

1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:52.600
 it was just killing me,

1:02:52.600 --> 1:02:55.680
 because I knew I couldn't explain it to him.

1:02:55.680 --> 1:02:58.200
 And it's true, I mean, he could vaguely gesture toward,

1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:00.040
 but the kid didn't understand surgery,

1:03:00.040 --> 1:03:02.160
 and cutting his body, and taking things out of it,

1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:04.680
 and that this was gonna make him much better

1:03:04.680 --> 1:03:06.680
 in the long run, but I remember thinking,

1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:08.880
 that's a great metaphor for us vis a vis God,

1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:11.120
 is here's God, infinitely loving God,

1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:13.400
 who's with us all the time, and we say,

1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:14.720
 what are you doing?

1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:17.160
 Why aren't you taking this away from me?

1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:20.040
 And the answer, I mean, ultimately is trust,

1:03:20.040 --> 1:03:24.040
 trust me, trust me, surrender to me.

1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:25.480
 And when we don't, that's,

1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:29.080
 we get in trouble with the old pride,

1:03:29.080 --> 1:03:31.320
 and the hubris, and all that kind of stuff.

1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:33.440
 Yeah, no, but trust me when I tell you,

1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:36.160
 I mean, I completely get it in my own life,

1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:38.960
 and as a priest, you're dealing with suffering all the time,

1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:41.440
 with people in pain all the time.

1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:43.400
 I remember as a young priest,

1:03:43.400 --> 1:03:47.120
 there was a policeman in our parish,

1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:50.440
 so he had a gun, and inexplicably,

1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:52.800
 no one had any clue.

1:03:52.800 --> 1:03:55.480
 He got up one night, shot his son to death,

1:03:55.480 --> 1:03:57.080
 and then shot himself.

1:03:57.080 --> 1:03:58.240
 This is my parish.

1:03:58.240 --> 1:04:01.280
 So I went to the wake, I remember, I show up,

1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:04.720
 and I'm this young, 27 year old goofball priest,

1:04:04.720 --> 1:04:07.080
 and I roll my collar around, and I walk in,

1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:09.000
 and there were two coffins,

1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:10.200
 the two coffins in the room,

1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:11.760
 there's the son and the father.

1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:16.760
 And the mother was there, and she went like this to me.

1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:21.760
 She saw me, okay, you're the religious guy here, what?

1:04:21.760 --> 1:04:26.080
 And just by instinct, I went like that too.

1:04:26.080 --> 1:04:29.920
 I went like, I don't know what to tell, I can't,

1:04:29.920 --> 1:04:32.240
 I don't have an answer for you.

1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:34.520
 But I was there,

1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:36.040
 and I'm not saying to pat myself on the back,

1:04:36.040 --> 1:04:38.800
 this is, that's where the church goes,

1:04:38.800 --> 1:04:41.760
 because Jesus went there.

1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:44.920
 Now we're gesturing toward a more theological response.

1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:47.120
 The first one's more austerely philosophical,

1:04:47.120 --> 1:04:49.500
 God permits evil to bring about a good.

1:04:49.500 --> 1:04:52.480
 But the theological response is, that's where Christ went,

1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:54.040
 is he went all the way down.

1:04:54.040 --> 1:04:56.720
 He went all the way down into our suffering.

1:04:56.720 --> 1:05:01.720
 And see the cross as the limit case of evil,

1:05:01.720 --> 1:05:06.720
 humiliation and cruelty and institutional injustice

1:05:08.080 --> 1:05:11.160
 and psychological suffering and spiritual suffering

1:05:11.160 --> 1:05:13.760
 and death, it's all there.

1:05:13.760 --> 1:05:16.000
 And that's where the Son of God went.

1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:19.360
 And I would say that's why, as a priest, I went there.

1:05:19.360 --> 1:05:22.100
 That's my job, is to go to those places.

1:05:22.100 --> 1:05:26.160
 So that's the ultimate answer to the problem.

1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:30.840
 So there is, we can't comprehend it,

1:05:30.840 --> 1:05:34.040
 but there is meaning to the suffering and the injustice.

1:05:34.040 --> 1:05:37.320
 We trust it because we know on other grounds

1:05:37.320 --> 1:05:38.160
 of God's existence.

1:05:38.160 --> 1:05:39.720
 See, I would resist the claim that,

1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:42.440
 well, this is such a knockdown argument,

1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:43.720
 so now we know there is no God.

1:05:43.720 --> 1:05:45.360
 I would say, no, there are all kinds

1:05:45.360 --> 1:05:46.960
 of other rational warrants for God.

1:05:46.960 --> 1:05:49.680
 And so I know that God exists.

1:05:49.680 --> 1:05:51.360
 I know that God is infinite love,

1:05:51.360 --> 1:05:54.040
 and now I gotta square that with this experience.

1:05:54.040 --> 1:05:58.160
 And the way I do that is by a trusting confidence

1:05:58.160 --> 1:06:01.160
 that God knows what he's about.

1:06:01.160 --> 1:06:03.600
 Again, I know how inadequate that always seems

1:06:03.600 --> 1:06:05.680
 to anyone who's suffering, including myself,

1:06:05.680 --> 1:06:07.660
 when I'm in great suffering.

1:06:07.660 --> 1:06:09.940
 But I think that's the best that we've done

1:06:09.940 --> 1:06:11.280
 in the great tradition.

1:06:11.280 --> 1:06:16.160
 So if you were to steel man the case against God

1:06:16.160 --> 1:06:20.160
 or the existence of God, you find the most convincing

1:06:20.160 --> 1:06:23.400
 argument is there's evil in the world,

1:06:23.400 --> 1:06:24.560
 therefore there's no God.

1:06:24.560 --> 1:06:25.600
 There's too much of it.

1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:27.000
 If I were to steel man that argument,

1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:28.320
 I'd do what Stephen Fry does.

1:06:28.320 --> 1:06:30.180
 I would do what Dostoevsky's Ivan does.

1:06:30.180 --> 1:06:31.500
 I would do exactly that.

1:06:31.500 --> 1:06:34.200
 I would say there's just too much.

1:06:34.200 --> 1:06:37.300
 And then if you wanna keep pressing it, animal suffering.

1:06:37.300 --> 1:06:39.000
 So we talk about human suffering,

1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:42.880
 but the suffering of animals over the eons and so on,

1:06:44.040 --> 1:06:46.560
 isn't there just too much suffering

1:06:46.560 --> 1:06:49.320
 to be reconciled with an infinitely good God?

1:06:49.320 --> 1:06:51.000
 And that's, again, Thomas Aquinas.

1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:55.040
 I've just used his very steel man argument.

1:06:55.040 --> 1:06:57.280
 You mentioned that, again, on Reddit,

1:06:57.280 --> 1:07:02.080
 somebody asked who your favorite communicator

1:07:02.080 --> 1:07:06.880
 of atheist ideas was, and you mentioned Christopher Hitchens.

1:07:06.880 --> 1:07:11.880
 Are there other ideas for atheism

1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:15.040
 that you find particularly challenging?

1:07:15.040 --> 1:07:18.080
 Well, that's the one, is the problem of evil.

1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:19.760
 The other objection in Aquinas,

1:07:19.760 --> 1:07:22.420
 which has a lot of contemporary resonance,

1:07:22.420 --> 1:07:26.400
 is can't we just explain everything through natural causes?

1:07:26.400 --> 1:07:28.040
 Why would you have to invoke a cause

1:07:28.040 --> 1:07:30.480
 beyond the causes in the world?

1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:33.720
 So as I'm trying to explain, let's say for Aquinas,

1:07:33.720 --> 1:07:37.080
 motion, causality, finality,

1:07:37.080 --> 1:07:39.260
 can I just do that with natural causes?

1:07:39.260 --> 1:07:41.520
 Wouldn't that suffice to explain it?

1:07:41.520 --> 1:07:44.840
 So I get like when naturalists are speaking

1:07:44.840 --> 1:07:46.520
 or people that are pure materialists,

1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:49.040
 they'll just say, no, that's perfectly adequate.

1:07:49.040 --> 1:07:52.440
 A scientific account of reality is utterly adequate

1:07:52.440 --> 1:07:54.260
 to our experience.

1:07:55.140 --> 1:07:56.860
 So I would steel man that and say,

1:07:56.860 --> 1:07:59.680
 well, show me why we need something more.

1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:02.680
 And to do that, you gotta get out of Plato's cave,

1:08:02.680 --> 1:08:03.720
 it seems to me.

1:08:03.720 --> 1:08:06.240
 Because my objection to naturalism

1:08:08.400 --> 1:08:12.160
 is it's staying within the realm

1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:15.920
 of the immediately empirically observable

1:08:15.920 --> 1:08:17.400
 and making the mistake of saying

1:08:17.400 --> 1:08:19.760
 that's all there is to being.

1:08:19.760 --> 1:08:22.840
 That's all there is that needs to be explained.

1:08:22.840 --> 1:08:25.640
 And long before we get to religion,

1:08:25.640 --> 1:08:27.400
 just stay with Plato.

1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:28.840
 The first step out of the cave,

1:08:28.840 --> 1:08:31.080
 if you combine it now with the parable of the line,

1:08:31.080 --> 1:08:33.160
 is mathematical objects.

1:08:33.160 --> 1:08:36.480
 And I'm with those, the many people that would say,

1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:39.760
 mathematics is an experience of the immaterial.

1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:42.860
 I've stepped out of a merely empirical,

1:08:42.860 --> 1:08:45.020
 physical, naturalistic world.

1:08:45.020 --> 1:08:48.320
 The minute I understand a pure number

1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:52.120
 or a pure equation or a pure mathematical relationship,

1:08:53.080 --> 1:08:55.400
 which would obtain in any possible world,

1:08:55.400 --> 1:08:57.880
 which are not tied to space and time,

1:08:58.920 --> 1:09:01.400
 that's a first step out of the cave.

1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:05.560
 And then that leads to the more metaphysical reflections.

1:09:05.560 --> 1:09:07.040
 For example, in the nature of being.

1:09:07.040 --> 1:09:08.880
 I mean, so I could talk about this thing

1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:10.720
 as a physical object and I can analyze it

1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:13.800
 at all kinds of levels and follow all the scientists

1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:16.560
 up and down through this thing, and fine, fine.

1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:17.960
 But I'm still in Plato's cave.

1:09:17.960 --> 1:09:20.720
 I'm still looking at the flickering images on the wall.

1:09:20.720 --> 1:09:24.200
 But when I step out of that into the mathematical realm,

1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:28.000
 I have entered a different realm of being, seems to me.

1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.360
 Do you think it's possible for the cave to expand

1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:32.900
 so large that it encompasses the whole world?

1:09:32.900 --> 1:09:37.900
 Meaning, is it possible that we're just clueless right now

1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:41.600
 in terms of, scientifically speaking,

1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:45.240
 with most of the world we haven't figured out yet?

1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:49.080
 But do you think it's possible through science to know God,

1:09:49.080 --> 1:09:50.540
 to look outside the world?

1:09:50.540 --> 1:09:52.080
 So it's fundamentally the limit

1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:54.520
 of the empirical scientific method,

1:09:54.520 --> 1:09:57.880
 is that we can't know some of these very big questions.

1:09:57.880 --> 1:10:00.120
 No, I'm not a scientist,

1:10:00.120 --> 1:10:02.280
 and I was never all that good at science.

1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:03.640
 I was more of a humanities guy.

1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:06.660
 But I love and respect the sciences, but I hate scientism.

1:10:06.660 --> 1:10:10.480
 And scientism is rampant today, with especially young people.

1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:11.840
 The reduction of all knowledge

1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:13.200
 to the scientific form of knowledge.

1:10:13.200 --> 1:10:16.600
 And I'm a vehement opponent of that.

1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:18.840
 There are dimensions of being that are not capturable

1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:21.480
 through a scientific method of mere observation,

1:10:21.480 --> 1:10:24.220
 hypothesis formation, experimentation, et cetera.

1:10:24.220 --> 1:10:26.880
 As great as that is, as wonderful as that is,

1:10:26.880 --> 1:10:29.400
 but it's still, I think, within Plato's cave.

1:10:29.400 --> 1:10:31.040
 And that's not to say it's not real.

1:10:31.040 --> 1:10:34.200
 It's just at a relatively low level of reality.

1:10:34.200 --> 1:10:35.500
 You step out of Plato's cave

1:10:35.500 --> 1:10:37.960
 when you go into pure mathematics.

1:10:37.960 --> 1:10:38.960
 That's why, you know that article,

1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:40.380
 I just came across it recently,

1:10:40.380 --> 1:10:42.600
 and discovered this whole literature around it,

1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:44.780
 is Eugene Wigner's article, 1960,

1:10:44.780 --> 1:10:49.540
 called the unreasonable applicability of mathematics

1:10:49.540 --> 1:10:50.600
 to the physical sciences.

1:10:50.600 --> 1:10:51.560
 I think that's the title of it.

1:10:51.560 --> 1:10:53.920
 Or effectiveness or something like that, yeah.

1:10:53.920 --> 1:10:56.080
 But what's so cool is that he's not a religious man.

1:10:56.080 --> 1:10:57.960
 He was kind of a secular Jew.

1:10:57.960 --> 1:10:59.720
 But yet he uses the word miracle

1:10:59.720 --> 1:11:01.680
 like eight times in that article.

1:11:01.680 --> 1:11:03.600
 Because he just is so impressed by the fact

1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:08.600
 that high, complex mathematics describes so accurately

1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:11.580
 the physical world and can be used to create things

1:11:11.580 --> 1:11:13.020
 and to manipulate.

1:11:13.020 --> 1:11:15.200
 And why should that be true?

1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:18.320
 That there's something very weirdly mysterious

1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:19.900
 about that relationship.

1:11:19.900 --> 1:11:21.620
 And I would say it's because you stepped

1:11:21.620 --> 1:11:23.620
 into a higher order of being,

1:11:23.620 --> 1:11:26.060
 which is inclusive of a lower level being.

1:11:26.060 --> 1:11:27.740
 That's the Platonic approach,

1:11:27.740 --> 1:11:30.060
 is that as you move, now I'm going to a different metaphor,

1:11:30.060 --> 1:11:31.180
 you move to higher levels,

1:11:31.180 --> 1:11:33.180
 they're inclusive of the lower levels.

1:11:33.180 --> 1:11:35.380
 Yeah, there's some magic there

1:11:35.380 --> 1:11:38.020
 that seems to, at least in our current understanding

1:11:38.020 --> 1:11:42.340
 of science, to be not quite capturable.

1:11:42.340 --> 1:11:45.260
 Even consciousness, the idea of consciousness.

1:11:45.260 --> 1:11:46.780
 Can I ask you, where do you think

1:11:46.780 --> 1:11:48.060
 the laws of nature come from?

1:11:48.060 --> 1:11:49.900
 So, I mean, sort of the Vigner question,

1:11:49.900 --> 1:11:54.900
 where does the deep mathematical structure

1:11:55.300 --> 1:11:56.280
 of things come from?

1:11:56.280 --> 1:11:57.340
 How do you explain that?

1:11:57.340 --> 1:12:00.740
 The mathematical structure or the fact

1:12:00.740 --> 1:12:04.340
 that the structure is somehow pleasing and beautiful.

1:12:04.340 --> 1:12:07.020
 Because those are two different.

1:12:07.020 --> 1:12:08.060
 Well, do the first one first.

1:12:08.060 --> 1:12:09.140
 I'm just curious to tell you,

1:12:09.140 --> 1:12:11.020
 where do you think it comes from?

1:12:11.020 --> 1:12:13.260
 I tend to believe, even in terms of physics,

1:12:13.260 --> 1:12:15.200
 we don't really know what's going on.

1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:18.620
 There's so, so, so much more to be discovered.

1:12:18.620 --> 1:12:21.060
 We're walking around in the dark

1:12:21.060 --> 1:12:23.580
 trying to figure out a little puzzles here and there,

1:12:23.580 --> 1:12:25.620
 and we're patting ourselves on the back

1:12:25.620 --> 1:12:28.080
 and how many puzzles we've discovered so far.

1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:30.180
 Even Gadot's incompleteness theorem,

1:12:30.180 --> 1:12:32.020
 what are the limits of mathematics,

1:12:32.020 --> 1:12:33.060
 axiomatic systems?

1:12:33.060 --> 1:12:37.300
 I don't know what is the purpose of mathematics,

1:12:37.300 --> 1:12:38.880
 what is the power of mathematics?

1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:43.880
 Is it just a useful tool to study the world around us,

1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:49.280
 or is it something deeper that we're just discovering?

1:12:50.700 --> 1:12:53.500
 All I know from my emotional perspective,

1:12:53.500 --> 1:12:57.020
 now I am an engineer, I'm a robotics AI person,

1:12:57.020 --> 1:12:58.220
 from an emotional perspective,

1:12:58.220 --> 1:12:59.980
 I just find the whole thing beautiful.

1:12:59.980 --> 1:13:01.740
 Yeah, but that's really cool to me.

1:13:01.740 --> 1:13:03.900
 That's a very interesting clue.

1:13:03.900 --> 1:13:05.460
 See, one of the arguments for God

1:13:05.460 --> 1:13:08.420
 is based on the intelligibility of the world.

1:13:08.420 --> 1:13:10.540
 It's like Wigner, it's a very peculiar fact,

1:13:10.540 --> 1:13:13.260
 it seems to me, that the world is so radically intelligible.

1:13:13.260 --> 1:13:14.500
 Why should that be true?

1:13:14.500 --> 1:13:15.980
 Why should it be the case

1:13:15.980 --> 1:13:18.900
 that being has this intelligible structure to it?

1:13:18.900 --> 1:13:21.660
 So it corresponds to an inquiring mind.

1:13:21.660 --> 1:13:25.500
 So Aquinas can say that the intelligible in act

1:13:25.500 --> 1:13:27.340
 is the intellect in act.

1:13:27.340 --> 1:13:29.660
 Meaning there's some deep correspondence

1:13:29.660 --> 1:13:32.820
 between this and that.

1:13:32.820 --> 1:13:34.620
 And I'm with Wigner.

1:13:34.620 --> 1:13:36.620
 That's, I think, really weird

1:13:36.620 --> 1:13:39.060
 and unreasonable and strange.

1:13:39.060 --> 1:13:44.060
 Now, my answer is, because the creator of the universe

1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:48.580
 is a great mind and has stamped the world

1:13:48.580 --> 1:13:50.420
 with intelligibility.

1:13:50.420 --> 1:13:52.360
 In the beginning was the Word, right?

1:13:52.360 --> 1:13:53.340
 And the Word was with God,

1:13:53.340 --> 1:13:55.540
 and all things came to be through the Word.

1:13:56.500 --> 1:13:58.580
 We shouldn't picture that so much.

1:13:58.580 --> 1:14:00.940
 It's gesturing in this very powerful direction.

1:14:01.860 --> 1:14:04.620
 There's an intelligence that has imbued the world

1:14:04.620 --> 1:14:05.840
 with intelligibility.

1:14:07.500 --> 1:14:09.980
 And we discover that, you know?

1:14:09.980 --> 1:14:11.420
 There's something about the simplicity

1:14:11.420 --> 1:14:12.880
 of the way the world works,

1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:15.580
 that's where the beauty comes from.

1:14:15.580 --> 1:14:18.620
 And yes, there's something profound to the mechanism,

1:14:18.620 --> 1:14:23.220
 whatever that is, God, that brought that to be.

1:14:23.220 --> 1:14:25.000
 That thought it into being.

1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:26.460
 That the world has been,

1:14:26.460 --> 1:14:28.640
 and the Bible says that God said,

1:14:28.640 --> 1:14:29.900
 "'Let there be light,' and there was light."

1:14:29.900 --> 1:14:32.620
 God said, well, again, we don't literalize the poetry,

1:14:32.620 --> 1:14:37.060
 but it's very rich that God spoke the world into being.

1:14:37.060 --> 1:14:40.580
 So that means it's been imbued with intelligibility

1:14:40.580 --> 1:14:41.560
 from the beginning.

1:14:42.580 --> 1:14:44.700
 They say that the condition for the possibility

1:14:44.700 --> 1:14:46.840
 of the Western physical sciences

1:14:46.840 --> 1:14:49.020
 was a basically Christian idea,

1:14:49.020 --> 1:14:51.500
 namely that the world is not God.

1:14:51.500 --> 1:14:54.140
 Therefore, I can analyze it, experiment upon it.

1:14:54.140 --> 1:14:55.700
 I don't divinize it.

1:14:55.700 --> 1:14:57.780
 I don't have a mystical relation to the world.

1:14:57.780 --> 1:14:59.020
 It's not God.

1:14:59.020 --> 1:15:01.200
 But secondly, that it's absolutely

1:15:01.200 --> 1:15:03.400
 in every nook and cranny intelligible.

1:15:03.400 --> 1:15:06.780
 And those two ideas are correlated to the idea of creation.

1:15:06.780 --> 1:15:09.820
 So it's been created, it's not God, it's other than God,

1:15:09.820 --> 1:15:13.500
 but yet it's touched in every dimension by God's mind.

1:15:13.500 --> 1:15:15.500
 And when those two things are in place,

1:15:15.500 --> 1:15:17.240
 the sciences get underway.

1:15:17.240 --> 1:15:19.660
 You know, I don't worship the world anymore,

1:15:19.660 --> 1:15:22.440
 but I'm also utterly confident I can come to know it.

1:15:22.440 --> 1:15:24.620
 And those are theological ideas.

1:15:24.620 --> 1:15:27.220
 Well, we live in this world,

1:15:27.220 --> 1:15:30.680
 so we can solve quite a lot of problems of this world

1:15:30.680 --> 1:15:32.060
 by making the assumption

1:15:32.060 --> 1:15:34.780
 that this world is fully understandable.

1:15:34.780 --> 1:15:36.920
 And we don't need to worry about what's outside the world

1:15:36.920 --> 1:15:41.480
 in some sense in order to build bridges and rockets

1:15:41.480 --> 1:15:43.700
 and computers and all that kind of stuff.

1:15:43.700 --> 1:15:47.220
 It's only when we get to the questions that are deeper

1:15:47.220 --> 1:15:49.420
 about why we're here at all,

1:15:49.420 --> 1:15:51.100
 what does it mean to be good,

1:15:51.100 --> 1:15:52.080
 all those kinds of things

1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:54.620
 do we need to reach outside of this world?

1:15:54.620 --> 1:15:55.980
 Can I introduce another one?

1:15:55.980 --> 1:15:57.380
 So I talked about mathematics.

1:15:57.380 --> 1:15:58.740
 I think it's stepping out of the cave,

1:15:58.740 --> 1:16:02.760
 it's stepping out of just the purely empirical world.

1:16:02.760 --> 1:16:05.140
 But the very fact that we use a word like universe

1:16:05.140 --> 1:16:06.300
 to me is very interesting.

1:16:06.300 --> 1:16:07.520
 Even if you say multiple universes,

1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:12.520
 to me it's like, well, whatever the whole is, the totality.

1:16:13.500 --> 1:16:15.680
 Universum, turn toward the one.

1:16:17.500 --> 1:16:18.740
 Why would we call it that?

1:16:18.740 --> 1:16:20.580
 Why wouldn't we just call it an aggregate?

1:16:20.580 --> 1:16:22.020
 You know, it's just an aggregate of stuff.

1:16:22.020 --> 1:16:23.260
 It's an aggregate of all kinds.

1:16:23.260 --> 1:16:24.940
 But we call it a universe.

1:16:24.940 --> 1:16:28.140
 And my answer from the classical metaphysical tradition

1:16:28.140 --> 1:16:30.380
 is it's the intuition of being.

1:16:30.380 --> 1:16:32.700
 So I immediately experience things here,

1:16:32.700 --> 1:16:35.100
 the color and shape, and I can measure them.

1:16:35.100 --> 1:16:37.260
 But when I've really stepped out of the cave

1:16:37.260 --> 1:16:39.540
 and I've now engaged beyond mathematics even,

1:16:39.540 --> 1:16:41.700
 I'm now into metaphysical reflection.

1:16:41.700 --> 1:16:44.820
 I'm interested not just in this thing as an object

1:16:44.820 --> 1:16:46.300
 and how it's colored and shaped

1:16:46.300 --> 1:16:48.560
 and what its atoms and quarks and all that are.

1:16:48.560 --> 1:16:49.620
 That's fine.

1:16:49.620 --> 1:16:51.540
 But I'm interested now in,

1:16:51.540 --> 1:16:53.660
 I don't mean to say this thing is real.

1:16:53.660 --> 1:16:56.100
 So what makes this a being?

1:16:56.100 --> 1:16:58.460
 And then what are the characteristics of being?

1:16:58.460 --> 1:17:00.140
 So now from Aristotle to Heidegger,

1:17:00.140 --> 1:17:02.740
 this question of the nature of being.

1:17:02.740 --> 1:17:04.980
 But see, I would say we call it a universe

1:17:04.980 --> 1:17:08.060
 because it's turned toward the one of being.

1:17:08.060 --> 1:17:09.660
 It's this intuition that whatever,

1:17:09.660 --> 1:17:12.460
 from quarks to galaxies to whatever,

1:17:12.460 --> 1:17:15.420
 give me a billion other universes,

1:17:15.420 --> 1:17:17.580
 it would still be existence, right?

1:17:17.580 --> 1:17:19.340
 It's turned toward the one.

1:17:19.340 --> 1:17:22.500
 That being unites our experience.

1:17:22.500 --> 1:17:24.740
 And so now I'm at the metaphysical level of analysis.

1:17:24.740 --> 1:17:27.220
 I've taken another step out of the cave.

1:17:27.220 --> 1:17:29.460
 In Plato's language, I'm at the formal level now,

1:17:29.460 --> 1:17:31.580
 beyond mathematics, the level of forms.

1:17:31.580 --> 1:17:34.180
 And the formal is inclusive of the mathematical,

1:17:34.180 --> 1:17:36.300
 which is inclusive of the physical.

1:17:36.300 --> 1:17:37.620
 And I think that's Eugene Wigner,

1:17:37.620 --> 1:17:39.780
 is that the mathematical includes the physical.

1:17:39.780 --> 1:17:42.520
 It is metaphysically prior to it.

1:17:43.780 --> 1:17:45.460
 But here we are sitting in the physical

1:17:45.460 --> 1:17:47.060
 trying to make sense of why

1:17:47.060 --> 1:17:48.500
 the unreasonable effectiveness

1:17:48.500 --> 1:17:51.940
 is the thing that's beyond, which is the mathematics.

1:17:51.940 --> 1:17:53.020
 My answer is God.

1:17:53.020 --> 1:17:54.740
 And I don't know a better answer.

1:17:54.740 --> 1:17:58.740
 And as I read Wigner, he wasn't ready to say that.

1:17:58.740 --> 1:18:00.700
 But I think the language is gesturing.

1:18:01.820 --> 1:18:02.900
 I was reading someone recently,

1:18:02.900 --> 1:18:04.820
 some very well known physicist,

1:18:04.820 --> 1:18:07.420
 who said his answer to Wigner's question

1:18:07.420 --> 1:18:11.300
 is that whoever is responsible for the universe

1:18:11.300 --> 1:18:12.620
 must be a mathematician.

1:18:13.460 --> 1:18:15.220
 And I thought, yeah, that's right.

1:18:16.660 --> 1:18:18.140
 Let me ask you about Jordan Peterson.

1:18:18.140 --> 1:18:20.740
 We had a great conversation with him.

1:18:20.740 --> 1:18:24.220
 He has a complicated and nuanced view of faith,

1:18:24.220 --> 1:18:25.920
 or faith period.

1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:28.720
 He has said that he believes in Jesus,

1:18:28.720 --> 1:18:30.340
 the person and the myth,

1:18:30.340 --> 1:18:33.660
 and some of the full richness and complexity

1:18:33.660 --> 1:18:35.860
 that you've talked about.

1:18:35.860 --> 1:18:37.540
 But he's surprised by his faith.

1:18:37.540 --> 1:18:39.420
 He's not sure what to make of it.

1:18:39.420 --> 1:18:41.440
 He's almost like meta struggling

1:18:41.440 --> 1:18:43.940
 with what the heck his faith means.

1:18:43.940 --> 1:18:45.940
 He's a super powerful intellect

1:18:45.940 --> 1:18:49.180
 that can't compute the faith that he's experiencing.

1:18:49.180 --> 1:18:52.380
 So what are some interesting differences

1:18:52.380 --> 1:18:56.220
 between the two of you, or some commonalities

1:18:56.220 --> 1:18:59.420
 in terms of your understanding of faith?

1:18:59.420 --> 1:19:00.580
 He's a very interesting guy.

1:19:00.580 --> 1:19:02.120
 I've had a couple of conversations with him.

1:19:02.120 --> 1:19:06.020
 And I do think he's moving in the direction of faith.

1:19:06.020 --> 1:19:09.140
 And his lectures on the Bible are very fine, I think.

1:19:09.140 --> 1:19:10.540
 He reminds me of the church fathers,

1:19:10.540 --> 1:19:12.980
 because the church fathers would have looked at the,

1:19:12.980 --> 1:19:15.500
 they call it the moral sense of the scripture.

1:19:15.500 --> 1:19:18.060
 Peterson probably called it the psychological meaning.

1:19:18.060 --> 1:19:19.860
 But I think he's doing a lot of that.

1:19:19.860 --> 1:19:22.580
 He, as I read him and talk to him,

1:19:22.580 --> 1:19:25.860
 I think he's kind of at a Kantian level in regard to Jesus.

1:19:25.860 --> 1:19:29.140
 What I mean there is, for Kant, Jesus is,

1:19:29.140 --> 1:19:30.780
 it's not so much the historical Jesus,

1:19:30.780 --> 1:19:31.900
 this figure from long ago.

1:19:31.900 --> 1:19:35.780
 It's Jesus as an archetype of the moral life.

1:19:35.780 --> 1:19:37.820
 You know, he says he's the image of the person

1:19:37.820 --> 1:19:39.500
 perfectly pleasing to God.

1:19:39.500 --> 1:19:43.180
 And so Jesus inhabits our kind of moral imagination

1:19:43.180 --> 1:19:48.100
 as a heuristic, as a goal that we're tending toward.

1:19:48.100 --> 1:19:51.560
 But the historical person of Jesus for Kant is like,

1:19:51.560 --> 1:19:52.980
 well, let's not fuss about that so much.

1:19:52.980 --> 1:19:54.740
 It's this figure.

1:19:54.740 --> 1:19:56.940
 And as I read Peterson, especially, and talk to him,

1:19:56.940 --> 1:20:01.020
 I think he's kind of there with the archetype of Jesus.

1:20:01.020 --> 1:20:04.860
 And even language of like, live as though God exists.

1:20:04.860 --> 1:20:06.460
 That's the als ob of Kant.

1:20:06.460 --> 1:20:09.940
 You know, the kind of as if attitude.

1:20:09.940 --> 1:20:12.040
 And where I repress him when we talk

1:20:12.040 --> 1:20:14.580
 is in the direction of, no, that's not Christianity yet.

1:20:14.580 --> 1:20:18.080
 I mean, that's enlightenment moral philosophy.

1:20:18.080 --> 1:20:20.580
 But Christianity is very interested

1:20:20.580 --> 1:20:22.220
 in this historical figure,

1:20:22.220 --> 1:20:26.500
 and very interested that God really became one of us.

1:20:26.500 --> 1:20:29.620
 And he's not just an archetype of the moral life.

1:20:29.620 --> 1:20:34.040
 He's someone, he's a person who's invaded our world

1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:35.780
 and gone all the way to the bottom of sin

1:20:35.780 --> 1:20:37.260
 and thereby saved us, you know.

1:20:37.260 --> 1:20:40.820
 So the facticity of Jesus ended up the resurrection.

1:20:40.820 --> 1:20:43.340
 So like, Peterson will talk about the resurrection

1:20:43.340 --> 1:20:45.220
 as a myth and all that.

1:20:45.220 --> 1:20:47.580
 And you can find that in different cultures, et cetera.

1:20:47.580 --> 1:20:51.420
 But Christianity is saying something else.

1:20:51.420 --> 1:20:54.900
 So in Christianity, when we're talking about who is Jesus,

1:20:54.900 --> 1:20:56.580
 it's not just an archetype.

1:20:56.580 --> 1:20:57.940
 It's not just a myth.

1:20:57.940 --> 1:20:59.420
 It's a historical figure.

1:20:59.420 --> 1:21:04.420
 And the very grounded fact that God became one of us

1:21:04.420 --> 1:21:08.180
 is fundamental to this idea of what Christianity is,

1:21:08.180 --> 1:21:09.380
 what it means to be a Christian.

1:21:09.380 --> 1:21:14.380
 It's the sin and the love that came here down to earth.

1:21:16.380 --> 1:21:17.820
 It means we can be one with God.

1:21:17.820 --> 1:21:18.720
 So that's essential.

1:21:18.720 --> 1:21:19.980
 It's not just an archetype.

1:21:19.980 --> 1:21:20.940
 That's right.

1:21:20.940 --> 1:21:23.100
 You know, it always strikes me,

1:21:23.100 --> 1:21:24.980
 the difference between, let's say,

1:21:24.980 --> 1:21:27.380
 mythic expressions and the New Testament.

1:21:28.820 --> 1:21:32.300
 Read someone like Carl Jung and then Joseph Campbell,

1:21:32.300 --> 1:21:34.220
 whom he influenced, and then now Jordan Peterson,

1:21:34.220 --> 1:21:35.380
 who's very Jungian.

1:21:35.380 --> 1:21:37.900
 And this sort of archetypal reading of the scriptures.

1:21:37.900 --> 1:21:38.740
 And great.

1:21:38.740 --> 1:21:39.980
 I mean, I think it's very interesting,

1:21:39.980 --> 1:21:42.300
 and there's a lot going on there.

1:21:42.300 --> 1:21:44.360
 There's a sort of calmness, though, about it.

1:21:44.360 --> 1:21:45.700
 Like, yeah, interesting.

1:21:45.700 --> 1:21:47.500
 And that's in this culture and that culture,

1:21:47.500 --> 1:21:49.380
 and it's the form of the moral life,

1:21:49.380 --> 1:21:51.420
 and mm hmm, I understand all that.

1:21:51.420 --> 1:21:53.220
 Then you read the New Testament.

1:21:53.220 --> 1:21:57.220
 Whatever those people are talking about, it's not that.

1:21:57.220 --> 1:22:00.920
 They are grabbing you by the shoulders

1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:03.020
 and shaking you to get your attention,

1:22:03.020 --> 1:22:06.900
 to tell you about something that happened to them, right?

1:22:06.900 --> 1:22:08.860
 Like the resurrection, you know,

1:22:08.860 --> 1:22:10.660
 the myth of the dying and rising God

1:22:10.660 --> 1:22:13.540
 and how powerful it is in shaping our consciousness.

1:22:13.540 --> 1:22:15.000
 Mm hmm, that's fascinating.

1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:16.340
 That's not the New Testament.

1:22:16.340 --> 1:22:18.460
 The New Testament is, did you hear?

1:22:18.460 --> 1:22:22.100
 Did you, Jesus of Nazareth, whom they put to death,

1:22:22.100 --> 1:22:23.620
 God raised him from the dead,

1:22:23.620 --> 1:22:26.660
 and he was seen by 500, and he was seen by Peter.

1:22:26.660 --> 1:22:29.720
 And then lastly, I saw him.

1:22:29.720 --> 1:22:31.260
 That's how Paul talks.

1:22:31.260 --> 1:22:34.920
 It's not the detached, you know,

1:22:34.920 --> 1:22:37.980
 psychologist musing on archetypal things.

1:22:37.980 --> 1:22:40.580
 And I think that makes a huge difference

1:22:40.580 --> 1:22:41.660
 when it comes to Christianity.

1:22:41.660 --> 1:22:46.660
 The intensity of the historical details are essential here.

1:22:46.740 --> 1:22:50.980
 So if you look at Hitler and Nazi Germany,

1:22:50.980 --> 1:22:53.380
 it's not enough to say, well, power corrupts,

1:22:53.380 --> 1:22:57.060
 and sometimes, so looking at the archetype of Hitler,

1:22:57.060 --> 1:22:58.700
 it's much, much more important,

1:22:58.700 --> 1:23:01.660
 much more powerful to look at the details

1:23:01.660 --> 1:23:03.720
 of how he came to power,

1:23:03.720 --> 1:23:06.540
 what are the ways he did evil onto the world,

1:23:06.540 --> 1:23:09.020
 and then you can get really intense

1:23:09.020 --> 1:23:12.220
 about your struggle with some of the complexities

1:23:12.220 --> 1:23:14.740
 of human nature and power on institutions

1:23:14.740 --> 1:23:15.860
 and all that kind of stuff.

1:23:15.860 --> 1:23:18.420
 So the historical nature of the Bible.

1:23:18.420 --> 1:23:19.980
 We're an historical religion.

1:23:19.980 --> 1:23:21.360
 And we've been, it's important.

1:23:21.360 --> 1:23:23.980
 We generate philosophical reflection.

1:23:23.980 --> 1:23:26.660
 We can find common ground with archetypal thinking

1:23:26.660 --> 1:23:28.060
 and all that, we can.

1:23:28.060 --> 1:23:30.820
 And the church fathers used Greek philosophy,

1:23:30.820 --> 1:23:33.460
 and Aquinas uses Aristotle, and all that's great.

1:23:33.460 --> 1:23:35.380
 But we're an historical religion,

1:23:35.380 --> 1:23:37.520
 and that matters immensely.

1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:40.740
 Is the Bible the literal word of God?

1:23:40.740 --> 1:23:44.440
 How do you make sense of the words that make up the Bible?

1:23:44.440 --> 1:23:46.060
 I think the best way to get at the Bible

1:23:46.060 --> 1:23:48.380
 is to think of it as a library, not a book.

1:23:48.380 --> 1:23:50.160
 So it's a collection of books, right,

1:23:50.160 --> 1:23:53.500
 from a wide variety of periods, different authors,

1:23:53.500 --> 1:23:56.460
 different audiences, and different genre.

1:23:56.460 --> 1:23:59.420
 So in the Bible, you find poetry, you find song,

1:23:59.420 --> 1:24:02.140
 you find something like history, not in our sense,

1:24:02.140 --> 1:24:03.580
 but something like history.

1:24:03.580 --> 1:24:05.740
 You find gospel, which is its own genre.

1:24:05.740 --> 1:24:08.780
 You find epistolary literature like Paul.

1:24:08.780 --> 1:24:10.840
 You find apocalyptic.

1:24:10.840 --> 1:24:13.000
 There's all this in the Bible.

1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:15.540
 So is the Bible literally the word of God?

1:24:15.540 --> 1:24:18.620
 It's like saying, is the library literally true?

1:24:18.620 --> 1:24:20.900
 It depends on what section you're in, right?

1:24:20.900 --> 1:24:25.900
 So parts of like one and two Samuel, one and two Kings,

1:24:26.100 --> 1:24:27.300
 number of places in the Old Testament.

1:24:27.300 --> 1:24:29.260
 Are there elements of the historical in there?

1:24:29.260 --> 1:24:31.980
 Sure, but it's theologically interpreted history.

1:24:31.980 --> 1:24:33.940
 It's not like our sense of history of, you know,

1:24:33.940 --> 1:24:37.940
 give me 10,000 footnotes and I'm gonna look

1:24:37.940 --> 1:24:40.180
 at all the source material I can possibly find.

1:24:40.180 --> 1:24:42.780
 It's more like ancient history, like Herodotus,

1:24:42.780 --> 1:24:44.440
 people like that.

1:24:44.440 --> 1:24:46.220
 But then there's poetry and there's myth

1:24:46.220 --> 1:24:47.800
 and there's legend and there's song

1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:48.880
 and all that stuff in the Bible.

1:24:48.880 --> 1:24:53.880
 So God breathes through all of it, I would say.

1:24:55.820 --> 1:24:58.500
 He inspired all of it, right, inspirare.

1:24:58.500 --> 1:25:00.440
 He's breathing through all of it.

1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:02.820
 God is speaking through all of it.

1:25:02.820 --> 1:25:05.060
 But he speaks in different voices.

1:25:05.060 --> 1:25:06.980
 He uses different human instruments

1:25:06.980 --> 1:25:09.760
 and he uses different genre and different types of language.

1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:10.980
 So we have to be sensitive to that

1:25:10.980 --> 1:25:12.260
 when we're interpreting the Bible.

1:25:12.260 --> 1:25:16.060
 So the different instruments are more or less,

1:25:16.060 --> 1:25:18.140
 some are more perfect than others in terms of music?

1:25:18.140 --> 1:25:18.980
 No, I wouldn't say that.

1:25:18.980 --> 1:25:19.820
 I wouldn't say more perfect.

1:25:19.820 --> 1:25:20.820
 I'd say they're just different.

1:25:20.820 --> 1:25:23.360
 It's like a symphony and God's like a conductor

1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:24.700
 and there's all kinds of different instruments

1:25:24.700 --> 1:25:27.840
 in the orchestra and he loves to breathe through the Psalms.

1:25:27.840 --> 1:25:29.860
 I prayed the Psalms this morning, I do every day.

1:25:29.860 --> 1:25:32.760
 In my office, you know, those are songs.

1:25:32.760 --> 1:25:34.620
 They probably were literally sung, most of them,

1:25:34.620 --> 1:25:35.660
 at one point.

1:25:35.660 --> 1:25:38.380
 He breathes through apocalyptic.

1:25:38.380 --> 1:25:39.900
 Like we're reading the book of Revelation now

1:25:39.900 --> 1:25:43.420
 in the Easter season and it's this wild and woolly book.

1:25:43.420 --> 1:25:47.820
 It should be filmed by Spielberg or somebody today.

1:25:47.820 --> 1:25:49.720
 And he speaks through the Gospels.

1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:51.900
 The Gospels correspond in genre

1:25:51.900 --> 1:25:54.180
 to what I call ancient biography.

1:25:54.180 --> 1:25:56.180
 That's the genre of the Gospels.

1:25:56.180 --> 1:25:59.340
 It's wrong to call them like mythic or simply literary.

1:25:59.340 --> 1:26:01.140
 They're like ancient biographies.

1:26:02.780 --> 1:26:05.780
 You have the Pauline letters which are about

1:26:05.780 --> 1:26:07.700
 particular cities that Paul was visiting

1:26:07.700 --> 1:26:09.400
 and particular people he knew.

1:26:09.400 --> 1:26:12.380
 So you just gotta be sensitive to the genre all the time.

1:26:12.380 --> 1:26:14.580
 Let's return back to human institutions

1:26:14.580 --> 1:26:19.260
 and talk about history of human civilization and politics.

1:26:19.260 --> 1:26:23.340
 So one question to ask is was America founded

1:26:23.340 --> 1:26:26.100
 as a Christian nation in your view?

1:26:26.100 --> 1:26:28.780
 If we look at the Declaration of Independence,

1:26:28.780 --> 1:26:30.720
 what did the words mean?

1:26:30.720 --> 1:26:32.780
 We hold these truths to be self evident

1:26:32.780 --> 1:26:34.820
 that all men are created equal,

1:26:34.820 --> 1:26:36.900
 that they are endowed by their creator

1:26:36.900 --> 1:26:39.220
 with certain inalienable rights

1:26:39.220 --> 1:26:41.820
 that among these are life, liberty,

1:26:41.820 --> 1:26:43.860
 and the pursuit of happiness.

1:26:43.860 --> 1:26:47.540
 It seems like God is breathing through those words too.

1:26:47.540 --> 1:26:49.260
 Yeah, I think so.

1:26:49.260 --> 1:26:53.260
 The founders would be some kind of combination of deism,

1:26:53.260 --> 1:26:56.940
 certainly Christianity is coming up through them,

1:26:56.940 --> 1:27:01.060
 enlightenment, rationalism, all in kind of a mix.

1:27:01.060 --> 1:27:03.300
 So you're not gonna find in our founding fathers

1:27:03.300 --> 1:27:05.820
 simply a Thomas Aquinas or like a purely

1:27:06.720 --> 1:27:08.220
 classically Christian understanding.

1:27:08.220 --> 1:27:11.700
 It's Christianity in those various expressions.

1:27:11.700 --> 1:27:13.560
 Because actually I would see the enlightenment

1:27:13.560 --> 1:27:16.780
 as a sort of child of Christianity.

1:27:16.780 --> 1:27:17.600
 We could talk about that.

1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:20.560
 But having said all that, yes,

1:27:20.560 --> 1:27:24.620
 I think they are expressing at least the residue

1:27:24.620 --> 1:27:28.500
 of a once deeply integrated Christian sense of things

1:27:28.500 --> 1:27:32.820
 that our rights are not created by the government.

1:27:32.820 --> 1:27:36.060
 They're not doled out by the government.

1:27:36.060 --> 1:27:37.420
 They come from God.

1:27:37.420 --> 1:27:39.780
 And the other thing I find really interesting is equality

1:27:39.780 --> 1:27:43.700
 because look in classical philosophy, political philosophy,

1:27:43.700 --> 1:27:47.260
 Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, it's not equality.

1:27:47.260 --> 1:27:50.180
 For them it's our inequality that's really interesting.

1:27:50.180 --> 1:27:52.440
 So Plato divides us into these three classes

1:27:52.440 --> 1:27:55.100
 and Aristotle says only a tiny little coterie

1:27:55.100 --> 1:27:58.100
 of property males of sufficient education

1:27:58.100 --> 1:27:59.300
 should be in the political life.

1:27:59.300 --> 1:28:01.220
 The rest should all be in private life.

1:28:01.220 --> 1:28:03.180
 And then some are suited for slavery.

1:28:03.180 --> 1:28:05.740
 So I mean he divides us dramatically.

1:28:05.740 --> 1:28:07.100
 Same with Cicero and so on.

1:28:08.520 --> 1:28:10.260
 Where does this come from, this weird idea

1:28:10.260 --> 1:28:12.040
 that we're all equal?

1:28:12.040 --> 1:28:12.880
 I mean how?

1:28:12.880 --> 1:28:14.100
 We're not equal in beauty, not equal in strength.

1:28:14.100 --> 1:28:16.120
 We're not equal in moral attainment.

1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:18.420
 We're not equal in intelligence.

1:28:18.420 --> 1:28:20.180
 So what is it?

1:28:20.180 --> 1:28:22.500
 And I think the residue especially comes through

1:28:22.500 --> 1:28:27.500
 in that little word that all men are created equal.

1:28:27.520 --> 1:28:31.460
 That's our equality, that we're all equally children of God.

1:28:31.460 --> 1:28:32.860
 So take God out of the picture.

1:28:32.860 --> 1:28:35.900
 I think we are gonna slide rapidly

1:28:35.900 --> 1:28:38.500
 into an embrace of inequality.

1:28:38.500 --> 1:28:40.740
 Now in the classical world, yes,

1:28:40.740 --> 1:28:42.560
 but heck, look at the 20th century.

1:28:42.560 --> 1:28:45.940
 I mean when God is excluded in a very systematic way,

1:28:45.940 --> 1:28:48.220
 I think you saw the suspension of rights

1:28:48.220 --> 1:28:51.740
 and the suspension of equality like mad.

1:28:51.740 --> 1:28:54.480
 So no, I think it's very important

1:28:54.480 --> 1:28:57.520
 that God is in the picture and that we're a nation under God.

1:28:57.520 --> 1:28:58.460
 It matters enormously.

1:28:58.460 --> 1:29:00.320
 That's not pious boilerplate.

1:29:00.320 --> 1:29:03.500
 That's at the rational foundations of our democracy.

1:29:03.500 --> 1:29:05.580
 So do you think Nietzsche was onto something

1:29:05.580 --> 1:29:09.340
 with the idea, looking into the 20th century,

1:29:09.340 --> 1:29:10.580
 that God is dead?

1:29:10.580 --> 1:29:15.580
 That there is a cultural distancing from a belief in God?

1:29:19.140 --> 1:29:20.700
 Yeah, I'd be somewhat sympathetic

1:29:20.700 --> 1:29:23.460
 to Jordan Peterson's reading of Nietzsche there.

1:29:23.460 --> 1:29:26.500
 Namely, it's not Nietzsche crowing from the mountaintop.

1:29:26.500 --> 1:29:28.580
 Hey, God is dead.

1:29:28.580 --> 1:29:30.100
 It's more of a lament.

1:29:30.100 --> 1:29:32.100
 God is dead and we've killed him.

1:29:32.100 --> 1:29:35.420
 And what will happen in the wake of that?

1:29:35.420 --> 1:29:38.340
 And I think, yeah, much of the totalitarianism

1:29:38.340 --> 1:29:43.340
 of the 20th century follows from that questioning of God

1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:46.940
 and the dismissal of God from public life.

1:29:46.940 --> 1:29:48.740
 So I would be sympathetic with that.

1:29:50.220 --> 1:29:51.980
 When we're beyond good and evil,

1:29:51.980 --> 1:29:54.400
 and all that's left is the will to power,

1:29:54.400 --> 1:29:58.040
 and then why are we surprised at the powerful rise

1:29:58.040 --> 1:30:01.180
 and that they use the powerless for their purposes?

1:30:01.180 --> 1:30:04.060
 When we forget ideas like equality and rights,

1:30:04.060 --> 1:30:05.300
 which are grounded in God,

1:30:05.300 --> 1:30:08.980
 why are we surprised that death camps follow?

1:30:08.980 --> 1:30:11.500
 So I think there's a correlation there for sure.

1:30:11.500 --> 1:30:13.660
 I don't know, I believe that there's a capacity

1:30:13.660 --> 1:30:17.740
 to do good in all of us and a capacity to do evil,

1:30:17.740 --> 1:30:20.480
 and there's something that tends towards good,

1:30:20.480 --> 1:30:22.060
 whatever that is.

1:30:22.060 --> 1:30:24.940
 I tend to think that if that community,

1:30:24.940 --> 1:30:27.700
 that love that we talked about, they find each other,

1:30:27.700 --> 1:30:30.780
 they find the good.

1:30:30.780 --> 1:30:32.300
 If you don't constrain the resources,

1:30:32.300 --> 1:30:33.220
 if you don't push them,

1:30:33.220 --> 1:30:37.460
 if you don't artificially create conflict

1:30:37.460 --> 1:30:41.300
 through power centers and evil charismatic leaders,

1:30:41.300 --> 1:30:42.980
 then people will be good to each other.

1:30:42.980 --> 1:30:47.100
 And whether that's God or some other source

1:30:47.100 --> 1:30:52.100
 of deep moral meaning,

1:30:52.180 --> 1:30:55.480
 that seems to be essential for a functioning civilization.

1:30:56.380 --> 1:30:58.300
 And it's hard, I mean, that's what humans are.

1:30:58.300 --> 1:31:01.460
 We're searching for what that God is, what that means.

1:31:01.460 --> 1:31:02.780
 You know what that triggers in my mind?

1:31:02.780 --> 1:31:04.060
 I wonder if you agree with this,

1:31:04.060 --> 1:31:06.260
 that the modern sciences drew their strength

1:31:06.260 --> 1:31:07.540
 from their narrowness.

1:31:07.540 --> 1:31:10.740
 And what I mean there is they almost completely bracketed

1:31:10.740 --> 1:31:13.100
 formal and final causality in the Aristotelian sense,

1:31:13.100 --> 1:31:16.220
 and they focused on efficient and material causality.

1:31:16.220 --> 1:31:18.220
 And that gave, as I say, great strength,

1:31:18.220 --> 1:31:20.140
 but from the narrowness of focus.

1:31:20.140 --> 1:31:22.660
 But for Aristotle, the more important causes

1:31:22.660 --> 1:31:24.900
 are the final and the formal causes.

1:31:24.900 --> 1:31:28.400
 And so final causality there, what's drawing us?

1:31:28.400 --> 1:31:30.440
 So for Aristotle, he'd look at someone like me and say,

1:31:30.440 --> 1:31:34.980
 okay, you have a intelligible structure,

1:31:34.980 --> 1:31:37.580
 and that leads you to seek certain things

1:31:37.580 --> 1:31:40.060
 for the perfection of that structure, you know?

1:31:40.060 --> 1:31:41.780
 And fair enough, I think that's right.

1:31:41.780 --> 1:31:42.700
 So I seek the good.

1:31:42.700 --> 1:31:44.780
 Right now, I'm seeking the good of being with you.

1:31:44.780 --> 1:31:47.060
 I said, yeah, I'll sit down with Lex Friedman

1:31:47.060 --> 1:31:49.540
 and we'll talk about deep and important things.

1:31:49.540 --> 1:31:52.320
 That's the good I sought this morning when I woke up.

1:31:52.320 --> 1:31:54.360
 Now, why am I seeking that?

1:31:54.360 --> 1:31:56.980
 Well, for a higher reason, a higher good, you know?

1:31:56.980 --> 1:32:01.620
 Because it's part of my work, my ministry is to, you know,

1:32:01.620 --> 1:32:04.740
 the church reaching out beyond itself to the wider culture,

1:32:04.740 --> 1:32:08.160
 and okay, well, why do you want that?

1:32:08.160 --> 1:32:10.100
 Well, because I want to bring more and more people

1:32:10.100 --> 1:32:13.000
 into what I think is beautiful and true and good

1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:13.900
 in the church.

1:32:13.900 --> 1:32:15.660
 Well, how come you want that?

1:32:15.660 --> 1:32:17.500
 Well, because a long time ago,

1:32:17.500 --> 1:32:19.820
 I was kind of myself brought into that realm

1:32:19.820 --> 1:32:21.340
 and find it very compelling.

1:32:21.340 --> 1:32:22.560
 Yeah, but then why do you want that?

1:32:22.560 --> 1:32:25.380
 Well, because ultimately, I want to be friends with God.

1:32:25.380 --> 1:32:27.020
 Now, I've given you one example there,

1:32:27.020 --> 1:32:30.700
 but any act of the will, it seems to me,

1:32:30.700 --> 1:32:32.780
 has to be analyzed that way.

1:32:32.780 --> 1:32:34.180
 The will seeks something.

1:32:34.180 --> 1:32:36.440
 It seeks the good, right, by definition.

1:32:36.440 --> 1:32:38.920
 But the good always nests like a Russian doll

1:32:38.920 --> 1:32:40.780
 in a higher good, right,

1:32:40.780 --> 1:32:43.100
 which then nests into still higher good.

1:32:43.100 --> 1:32:45.520
 Until you come, this is Aquinas,

1:32:45.520 --> 1:32:49.500
 to some, in this sense, uncaused cause,

1:32:49.500 --> 1:32:51.300
 an uncaused final cause,

1:32:51.300 --> 1:32:53.520
 there has to be some summum bonum, right,

1:32:53.520 --> 1:32:56.520
 some supreme good that you're looking for.

1:32:57.660 --> 1:32:59.820
 And that's God, by the way.

1:32:59.820 --> 1:33:01.780
 That's another, I think, rational path to God,

1:33:01.780 --> 1:33:04.620
 is every single moment, every day,

1:33:04.620 --> 1:33:07.020
 we are implicitly seeking God.

1:33:07.020 --> 1:33:10.900
 So with your Word on Fire ministries

1:33:10.900 --> 1:33:13.180
 and the website and the communication efforts,

1:33:13.180 --> 1:33:15.240
 what is the thing you're seeking?

1:33:15.240 --> 1:33:19.900
 Just you, if we can pause and for a brief moment,

1:33:19.900 --> 1:33:21.280
 allow you to be prideful.

1:33:21.280 --> 1:33:24.800
 Or, of course, just joking,

1:33:24.800 --> 1:33:27.280
 but what is your local efforts,

1:33:27.280 --> 1:33:29.320
 your small little pocket of the world

1:33:29.320 --> 1:33:34.320
 with small, in quotes, with Word on Fire?

1:33:35.460 --> 1:33:37.760
 Yeah, it's just using the media,

1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:39.460
 especially the new media, the social media,

1:33:39.460 --> 1:33:41.200
 to get the gospel out.

1:33:41.200 --> 1:33:43.800
 So I started, what, 20 some years ago,

1:33:43.800 --> 1:33:47.600
 just on a radio show in Chicago, 515 on Sunday morning.

1:33:47.600 --> 1:33:49.960
 I had a 15 minute sermon show.

1:33:49.960 --> 1:33:51.680
 And I asked the people in this parish I was at,

1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:55.360
 I said, I need $50,000 to get on for 15 minutes

1:33:55.360 --> 1:33:56.880
 at 515 on Sunday morning.

1:33:56.880 --> 1:33:58.800
 And they all laughed when I proposed that,

1:33:58.800 --> 1:34:00.040
 but they gave me the money.

1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:00.980
 So that's how I got started,

1:34:00.980 --> 1:34:02.720
 just doing a sermon on the radio.

1:34:02.720 --> 1:34:06.320
 And then it branched off into video stuff and TV.

1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:08.320
 And then I did a documentary.

1:34:08.320 --> 1:34:09.280
 I went all over the world

1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:11.800
 and kind of told the story of Catholicism.

1:34:11.800 --> 1:34:12.940
 So that's how we started.

1:34:12.940 --> 1:34:15.800
 And now I'm using all the new media and social media.

1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:18.080
 But what I really love, what we're doing today,

1:34:18.080 --> 1:34:19.200
 something I really like,

1:34:19.200 --> 1:34:20.960
 which is having a conversation

1:34:20.960 --> 1:34:23.120
 outside of just the narrow Catholic world

1:34:23.120 --> 1:34:24.480
 or even the narrow Christian world,

1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:26.700
 but to look out to the wider culture

1:34:26.700 --> 1:34:29.060
 and who's talking about interesting things

1:34:29.060 --> 1:34:31.160
 and how can the church engage there?

1:34:31.160 --> 1:34:34.120
 And so that's the purpose of Word on Fire.

1:34:34.120 --> 1:34:39.120
 Is it overwhelming to face so many different atheists

1:34:40.840 --> 1:34:44.560
 than complex thinkers like Jordan Peterson

1:34:44.560 --> 1:34:47.500
 and some of the more political style thinkers

1:34:47.500 --> 1:34:49.160
 that you've spoken with?

1:34:49.160 --> 1:34:52.640
 Is that, what is it, Dave Rubin,

1:34:52.640 --> 1:34:57.640
 who's also has a way different worldview as well?

1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:00.040
 Is that terrifying?

1:35:00.040 --> 1:35:01.640
 Is that exciting to you?

1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:03.640
 Is it challenging?

1:35:03.640 --> 1:35:06.520
 Yeah, maybe all of the above, but more exciting.

1:35:06.520 --> 1:35:08.000
 I would say I like doing that.

1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:09.280
 I was a teacher for a long time.

1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:10.840
 I taught in the seminary for like 20 years.

1:35:10.840 --> 1:35:13.240
 And so I've been engaging these questions for a long time.

1:35:13.240 --> 1:35:14.080
 I'm a writer.

1:35:14.080 --> 1:35:15.520
 I've written about 20 some books.

1:35:15.520 --> 1:35:17.800
 And I write some at a popular level.

1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:19.480
 I write some at a high academic level.

1:35:19.480 --> 1:35:21.440
 And I like doing all that.

1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:23.280
 So I love those ideas.

1:35:23.280 --> 1:35:26.340
 I love those questions, love engaging people.

1:35:26.340 --> 1:35:28.720
 And I find my own experience,

1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:32.240
 you do run into, of course, a lot of the vitriol

1:35:32.240 --> 1:35:34.800
 and kind of just stupidity and all that online.

1:35:34.800 --> 1:35:35.640
 And I get it.

1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:39.240
 And religion is such a magnet for people's hostility

1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:40.060
 for different reasons.

1:35:40.060 --> 1:35:40.920
 So I get that.

1:35:40.920 --> 1:35:42.700
 Like you read it, we talked about,

1:35:42.700 --> 1:35:47.340
 you have to wade through swamps of obscenity and everything.

1:35:47.340 --> 1:35:49.240
 But I do it.

1:35:49.240 --> 1:35:50.080
 I like it.

1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:51.320
 And it's worthwhile.

1:35:51.320 --> 1:35:53.160
 Because in that Reddit experience,

1:35:53.160 --> 1:35:56.120
 so many of the issues that preoccupy young people,

1:35:56.120 --> 1:35:57.120
 I can name them for you.

1:35:57.120 --> 1:35:58.680
 Exactly what they are.

1:35:58.680 --> 1:35:59.640
 It comes to religion.

1:35:59.640 --> 1:36:01.000
 How do you know there's a God?

1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:02.000
 So the God question.

1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:05.720
 Secondly, why is there so much suffering in the world?

1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:07.720
 Third question, why do you think your religion

1:36:07.720 --> 1:36:08.920
 is the right religion?

1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:11.320
 Fourth, why are you so mean to gay people?

1:36:11.320 --> 1:36:14.780
 So those are the four things that I, again and again,

1:36:14.780 --> 1:36:16.600
 come up when dealing with young people.

1:36:16.600 --> 1:36:19.220
 I've told my brother bishops and priests about that.

1:36:19.220 --> 1:36:22.200
 I said, structure your adult education programs

1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:24.120
 or structure your youth outreach

1:36:24.120 --> 1:36:25.520
 around those four questions.

1:36:26.380 --> 1:36:28.400
 Well, let me ask you about gay marriage.

1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:33.360
 How do we make sense of the love between a man and a man

1:36:33.360 --> 1:36:36.680
 and a woman and a woman and the institution of marriage?

1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:39.400
 We love friendship.

1:36:39.400 --> 1:36:41.240
 And friendship is at the heart of things.

1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:42.560
 And so nothing wrong with friendship

1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:45.600
 between a man and a man, a woman and a woman.

1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:48.360
 But go back to Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas

1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:51.320
 about natural finalities and intelligible forms,

1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:54.480
 that there's a certain form to human being,

1:36:54.480 --> 1:36:56.840
 which includes the physical and includes the sexual.

1:36:56.840 --> 1:36:58.280
 It has a proper finality.

1:36:58.280 --> 1:37:01.360
 And so we'd recognize that finality is twofold,

1:37:01.360 --> 1:37:03.100
 both unitive and procreative.

1:37:03.100 --> 1:37:05.240
 And so those two we recognize

1:37:05.240 --> 1:37:08.160
 as the appropriate expression of human sexuality.

1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:11.600
 So that's why the church holds to sex

1:37:11.600 --> 1:37:14.280
 between a man and a woman within the context of marriage

1:37:14.280 --> 1:37:16.720
 is the right expression.

1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:22.780
 We reach out to everybody in love and in respect

1:37:22.780 --> 1:37:26.480
 and deep understanding and seeking to understand

1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:28.420
 their lives from the inside.

1:37:28.420 --> 1:37:29.440
 So I mean, all of that,

1:37:29.440 --> 1:37:32.760
 I agree with the bridge building that we need to do

1:37:32.760 --> 1:37:34.160
 to people like in the gay community

1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:36.640
 and people in gay marriage and so on.

1:37:36.640 --> 1:37:40.480
 So the church holds to the intelligible structure,

1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:42.560
 if you want, of human sexuality

1:37:42.560 --> 1:37:44.680
 and it reaches out to real human beings

1:37:44.680 --> 1:37:47.920
 always in an attitude of invitation and love and so on.

1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:49.400
 So it's somewhere in there

1:37:49.400 --> 1:37:51.800
 that the church takes its stance.

1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:56.060
 And so there's probably variation

1:37:56.060 --> 1:37:58.320
 in the stances that it takes.

1:37:58.320 --> 1:38:00.040
 So you're saying the institution of marriage

1:38:00.040 --> 1:38:03.320
 is about the unitive, which is like the friendship,

1:38:03.320 --> 1:38:08.320
 the deep connection between two humans and the procreative.

1:38:08.320 --> 1:38:11.820
 So being able to have children and all that kind of stuff.

1:38:13.820 --> 1:38:14.660
 It's interesting.

1:38:14.660 --> 1:38:19.660
 So is our gay couples seen as sinful?

1:38:19.680 --> 1:38:23.560
 So does the church acknowledge the love?

1:38:23.560 --> 1:38:24.400
 Yeah.

1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:26.400
 That's the deep love that's possible between a man and a man.

1:38:26.400 --> 1:38:27.240
 I think so.

1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:29.380
 Yeah, which is why the church says in its official teaching,

1:38:29.380 --> 1:38:32.120
 it's the physical expression, let's say,

1:38:32.120 --> 1:38:36.760
 of sexual passion between two men that is problematic,

1:38:36.760 --> 1:38:39.440
 not their friendship, not their love for each other.

1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:43.480
 So I think, yeah, we confirm the first.

1:38:43.480 --> 1:38:45.600
 Well, let me ask you another difficult topic

1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:46.680
 that's just happening.

1:38:46.680 --> 1:38:49.600
 Unlike the other ones we talked about.

1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:51.520
 That's going on in the news now.

1:38:51.520 --> 1:38:54.080
 As we sit here today, the Supreme Court has voted

1:38:54.080 --> 1:38:58.920
 to overturn abortion rights in a draft majority opinion

1:38:58.920 --> 1:39:01.960
 striking down the landmark Roe versus Wade decision.

1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:04.080
 What are your thoughts on this?

1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:06.840
 First of all, the human institution of the Supreme Court

1:39:06.840 --> 1:39:10.000
 making these decisions throughout its history.

1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:14.800
 And second of all, just the idea, the really powerful,

1:39:14.800 --> 1:39:18.320
 the controversial, the difficult idea of abortion.

1:39:20.440 --> 1:39:22.760
 Yeah, I mean, I'm against abortion.

1:39:22.760 --> 1:39:25.120
 I'm pro life.

1:39:25.120 --> 1:39:27.320
 The church recognizes from the moment of conception,

1:39:27.320 --> 1:39:28.900
 we're dealing with a human life

1:39:28.900 --> 1:39:32.580
 that's worthy of respect and protection.

1:39:32.580 --> 1:39:36.680
 Especially as you see the unfolding of that person

1:39:36.680 --> 1:39:38.240
 across a pregnancy.

1:39:38.240 --> 1:39:41.480
 But at every stage, we recognize the beauty

1:39:41.480 --> 1:39:44.400
 and the dignity of that human being.

1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:47.760
 And so we stand opposed to this,

1:39:47.760 --> 1:39:49.640
 the outright killing of the innocent.

1:39:49.640 --> 1:39:51.240
 So that's the church's view.

1:39:52.520 --> 1:39:56.120
 Again, reaching out always in love and understanding

1:39:56.120 --> 1:39:58.040
 and compassion to those who are dealing.

1:39:58.040 --> 1:40:01.200
 And believe me, every single pastor, every single priest

1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:03.320
 understands that, because we deal with people all the time

1:40:03.320 --> 1:40:05.640
 who are in these painful situations.

1:40:05.640 --> 1:40:08.880
 But that's the moral side of it.

1:40:08.880 --> 1:40:11.680
 The legal side, I think Roe v. Wade was terribly decided.

1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:14.280
 I think one of the worst expressions of American law

1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:15.960
 since the Dred Scott decision.

1:40:15.960 --> 1:40:19.800
 So I stand in favor of a returning Roe v. Wade and Casey.

1:40:19.800 --> 1:40:21.080
 I think they were terrible.

1:40:21.080 --> 1:40:23.520
 The Casey decision is instructive to me.

1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:28.040
 It belongs to the nature of freedom, that decision says,

1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:30.500
 to determine the meaning of one's own life.

1:40:30.500 --> 1:40:32.560
 And I don't get the language exactly right,

1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:34.720
 but end of the universe.

1:40:34.720 --> 1:40:38.600
 Like it gives this staggering scope to our freedom,

1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:40.320
 that we can determine the meaning.

1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:42.040
 See, but that's repugnant to everything

1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:43.420
 we've just talked about.

1:40:43.420 --> 1:40:46.960
 That I'm inventing the meaning of my life

1:40:46.960 --> 1:40:48.120
 and of the universe.

1:40:48.120 --> 1:40:51.260
 And so Casey, though, was instructive in a way

1:40:51.260 --> 1:40:55.480
 because it tips its hat toward the problem culturally,

1:40:55.480 --> 1:40:59.560
 is that I think in my freedom, I can determine everything.

1:40:59.560 --> 1:41:01.560
 My choice is all that matters.

1:41:01.560 --> 1:41:04.960
 And I would say, no, your choice should be correlated

1:41:04.960 --> 1:41:06.600
 to the order of the good.

1:41:06.600 --> 1:41:08.140
 It's not sovereign.

1:41:08.140 --> 1:41:10.520
 It doesn't reign sovereignly over being

1:41:10.520 --> 1:41:12.760
 and it makes its own decisions.

1:41:12.760 --> 1:41:15.060
 So I think Casey was terrible law

1:41:15.060 --> 1:41:18.720
 and it was backing up Roe v. Wade, which is terrible law.

1:41:18.720 --> 1:41:20.900
 So I'm in favor of the overturning of those.

1:41:20.900 --> 1:41:22.560
 I've spoken out that many times.

1:41:22.560 --> 1:41:24.620
 Now it'll return it to the individual states.

1:41:24.620 --> 1:41:27.760
 It's not gonna solve the problem.

1:41:27.760 --> 1:41:29.800
 The individual states will have to decide.

1:41:29.800 --> 1:41:32.320
 I just heard yesterday, we were up in Sacramento,

1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:35.160
 the bishops having our annual meeting.

1:41:35.160 --> 1:41:38.920
 And so we got the word from the governor and the legislators

1:41:38.920 --> 1:41:41.120
 that they're gonna push for a constitutional amendment

1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:41.960
 in California.

1:41:41.960 --> 1:41:44.800
 So basically to make any attempt to limit abortion

1:41:44.800 --> 1:41:46.680
 in any way just illegal.

1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:49.120
 I think that's barbaric.

1:41:49.120 --> 1:41:51.960
 So I stand radically opposed to that.

1:41:51.960 --> 1:41:54.120
 It's such an interesting line

1:41:54.120 --> 1:41:57.680
 because if you believe that there's a,

1:41:57.680 --> 1:42:00.740
 it's a line that struggles with the question

1:42:00.740 --> 1:42:04.700
 of what does it mean to be a living being

1:42:04.700 --> 1:42:07.200
 or to give life to something.

1:42:08.880 --> 1:42:12.480
 Because if you believe that at the moment of conception

1:42:12.480 --> 1:42:15.740
 you're basically creating a human life,

1:42:16.760 --> 1:42:18.360
 then abortion is murder.

1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:21.880
 And then if you don't,

1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:26.160
 then it's a sort of basic biological choice

1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:30.360
 that's not taking away of a life.

1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:34.240
 And the gap between those two beliefs is so vast

1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:36.760
 that it's hard and yet so fundamental

1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:39.980
 to the question of what it means to be alive

1:42:39.980 --> 1:42:43.360
 and the fundamental question about the respect

1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:45.840
 for human life and human dignity.

1:42:45.840 --> 1:42:47.340
 It's interesting to see.

1:42:49.220 --> 1:42:51.160
 And also about freedom too.

1:42:51.160 --> 1:42:53.920
 All of those things are mixed in there.

1:42:53.920 --> 1:42:55.400
 It's a beautiful struggle.

1:42:55.400 --> 1:42:57.360
 Maybe the freedom is the most important,

1:42:57.360 --> 1:42:58.840
 this sort of freedom run amok.

1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:03.640
 Or in classical philosophy and theology,

1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:07.680
 freedom is not self determination.

1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:12.680
 Freedom is the disciplining of desire

1:43:12.800 --> 1:43:15.840
 so as to make the achievement of the good

1:43:15.840 --> 1:43:19.520
 first possible and then effortless.

1:43:19.520 --> 1:43:20.360
 You know what I'm saying?

1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:22.560
 So modern freedom and the roots of that

1:43:22.560 --> 1:43:26.160
 are people like William of Ockham in the late Middle Ages.

1:43:26.160 --> 1:43:28.340
 Freedom means I hover above the yes and the no.

1:43:28.340 --> 1:43:29.280
 Do I do yes or no?

1:43:29.280 --> 1:43:31.880
 And I'm the sovereign subject of that choice.

1:43:31.880 --> 1:43:35.460
 And on no basis I will say yes or no.

1:43:35.460 --> 1:43:39.560
 I'm like Louis XIV or I'm like Stalin or something.

1:43:39.560 --> 1:43:42.800
 But Aquinas wouldn't have recognized that as freedom.

1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:46.000
 For him, I got this desire in me.

1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:49.420
 I've got this will and it's pushing toward the good.

1:43:49.420 --> 1:43:51.280
 But the trouble is I got so many attachments

1:43:51.280 --> 1:43:54.760
 and I'm so stupid and I'm so conditioned by my sin

1:43:54.760 --> 1:43:56.280
 that I can't achieve it.

1:43:56.280 --> 1:43:59.520
 So I need to be disciplined in my desire

1:43:59.520 --> 1:44:01.880
 so as to make that achievement possible

1:44:01.880 --> 1:44:05.440
 and then effortless so right now

1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:07.960
 I'm freely speaking English to you.

1:44:07.960 --> 1:44:10.400
 And you had the experience and I've had it too

1:44:10.400 --> 1:44:11.800
 of learning a foreign language.

1:44:11.800 --> 1:44:14.880
 And don't you feel unfree?

1:44:14.880 --> 1:44:17.760
 You know, like when you're struggling with a language.

1:44:17.760 --> 1:44:19.600
 When I was over in Paris doing my doctoral work

1:44:19.600 --> 1:44:21.520
 and I was okay with French,

1:44:21.520 --> 1:44:23.720
 but my first time in a seminar

1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:27.080
 and there's all these intelligent francophones

1:44:27.080 --> 1:44:28.480
 around the table and they're all just,

1:44:28.480 --> 1:44:32.200
 and I'm trying to say my little thing in my awkward French.

1:44:32.200 --> 1:44:37.200
 And I felt unfree because my desire wasn't directed.

1:44:40.080 --> 1:44:42.680
 But then over time I became freer

1:44:42.680 --> 1:44:44.520
 and freer speaker of French.

1:44:44.520 --> 1:44:47.040
 I was ordered more to the good.

1:44:47.040 --> 1:44:48.660
 That's a better understanding of freedom

1:44:48.660 --> 1:44:51.560
 than sort of sovereign self determination.

1:44:51.560 --> 1:44:55.920
 But our country is now I think really in the grip of that.

1:44:55.920 --> 1:44:57.720
 I decide and that's where the Nietzschean thing

1:44:57.720 --> 1:45:00.280
 comes to my mind of the will to power.

1:45:00.280 --> 1:45:01.920
 I'm beyond good and evil.

1:45:01.920 --> 1:45:04.000
 It's just up to me to decide.

1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:05.360
 God help us.

1:45:05.360 --> 1:45:08.120
 No, it's the values that we intuit around us.

1:45:08.120 --> 1:45:11.000
 Intellectual, moral and aesthetic, the values.

1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:12.360
 Think of the dog on the beach again.

1:45:12.360 --> 1:45:15.320
 And that you get ordered to those

1:45:15.320 --> 1:45:18.680
 by your education, by your family, by your religion.

1:45:18.680 --> 1:45:19.560
 And that's beautiful.

1:45:19.560 --> 1:45:20.680
 That makes you free.

1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:23.160
 Now I can freely enter into this.

1:45:23.160 --> 1:45:26.160
 So this sovereign self determination business,

1:45:26.160 --> 1:45:27.140
 that's not my game.

1:45:28.240 --> 1:45:31.560
 The values come in part from the tradition

1:45:31.560 --> 1:45:33.600
 carried through the generations.

1:45:33.600 --> 1:45:36.680
 Let me ask you to put on your wise hat

1:45:36.680 --> 1:45:38.400
 and give advice to young folks.

1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:40.280
 So high school and college,

1:45:40.280 --> 1:45:44.480
 thinking about what to do with their life,

1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:48.600
 career, there's so many options out there.

1:45:48.600 --> 1:45:52.040
 How can they have a career they can be proud of

1:45:52.040 --> 1:45:54.560
 or even just a life they can be proud of?

1:45:56.760 --> 1:46:00.460
 I think I'd say find something you're good at

1:46:00.460 --> 1:46:01.640
 because that's from God.

1:46:01.640 --> 1:46:03.760
 It's a gift that God's given you.

1:46:03.760 --> 1:46:06.140
 And then dedicate it to love.

1:46:06.140 --> 1:46:06.980
 You know what I'm saying?

1:46:06.980 --> 1:46:11.200
 You're good at science or math or sports or whatever.

1:46:11.200 --> 1:46:13.880
 Okay, I'm gonna use that now for my aggrandizement,

1:46:13.880 --> 1:46:17.560
 for my wealth, for my privileges and to become famous.

1:46:17.560 --> 1:46:19.000
 No, no, no, don't.

1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:20.380
 Find what you're good at,

1:46:20.380 --> 1:46:23.780
 but now dedicate it to willing the good of the other.

1:46:23.780 --> 1:46:26.040
 So use your science and use your mathematics

1:46:26.040 --> 1:46:29.080
 and use your sports and use your musicianship

1:46:29.080 --> 1:46:30.840
 to benefit the world.

1:46:32.840 --> 1:46:33.880
 That's how I'd say them.

1:46:33.880 --> 1:46:35.080
 So find what you're good at.

1:46:35.080 --> 1:46:35.920
 That's from God.

1:46:35.920 --> 1:46:37.400
 Well, that's a tricky one.

1:46:37.400 --> 1:46:39.000
 Finding what you're good at

1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:41.420
 because it's not just raw skill.

1:46:41.420 --> 1:46:43.560
 It's also what you connect with.

1:46:43.560 --> 1:46:47.000
 And it's also like this iterative process

1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:50.480
 of if you wanna add love to the world,

1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:55.640
 you have to see how can you be effective at doing that.

1:46:55.640 --> 1:46:57.120
 So it's not just the things you're good at.

1:46:57.120 --> 1:47:02.120
 There's like, I'm good at building bridges out of toothpicks.

1:47:02.720 --> 1:47:05.640
 I'm not exactly sure that's going to be useful for the world.

1:47:05.640 --> 1:47:07.840
 Then again, to push back on that,

1:47:07.840 --> 1:47:11.360
 the joy brings me, maybe somehow the joy radiates out.

1:47:11.360 --> 1:47:13.200
 Yeah, well, you're good at what you're doing right now.

1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:16.240
 And you've dedicated that to bringing more light

1:47:16.240 --> 1:47:19.440
 and illumination and joy to the world.

1:47:19.440 --> 1:47:21.040
 That's true.

1:47:21.040 --> 1:47:23.400
 That was a searching.

1:47:23.400 --> 1:47:27.360
 That's a process of trying stuff and figuring it out.

1:47:27.360 --> 1:47:30.760
 And ultimately, yes, asking the question,

1:47:30.760 --> 1:47:32.640
 how is this making the world at all better

1:47:32.640 --> 1:47:34.680
 at every step of the way

1:47:34.680 --> 1:47:36.040
 as opposed to enriching yourself

1:47:36.040 --> 1:47:37.240
 and all those kinds of things?

1:47:37.240 --> 1:47:39.240
 Right, I think that's the name of the game.

1:47:39.240 --> 1:47:40.280
 But it's tricky.

1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:42.200
 And if we don't have moral mentors

1:47:42.200 --> 1:47:44.600
 and intellectual mentors, it becomes hard.

1:47:44.600 --> 1:47:47.320
 And if you tell a kid, that's deadly to me,

1:47:47.320 --> 1:47:50.720
 just decide for yourself, just off you go.

1:47:50.720 --> 1:47:52.800
 And you make your own choices.

1:47:52.800 --> 1:47:55.480
 I mean, your choice has to be disciplined.

1:47:55.480 --> 1:47:57.560
 Your desire has gotta be directed.

1:47:57.560 --> 1:47:59.720
 Then you'll find your creative path.

1:47:59.720 --> 1:48:01.640
 Everyone does it in its own way.

1:48:01.640 --> 1:48:03.880
 But it's a guided choice.

1:48:03.880 --> 1:48:05.880
 Your freedom is not sovereign.

1:48:05.880 --> 1:48:08.080
 It's a guided freedom.

1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:10.480
 So in the struggle and the suffering

1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:11.720
 you've seen in the world,

1:48:14.240 --> 1:48:16.840
 let me ask you the question of death.

1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:22.760
 How often do you think about your own mortality?

1:48:22.760 --> 1:48:23.960
 Every day.

1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:28.960
 And one, are you afraid of it, the uncertainty of it?

1:48:30.200 --> 1:48:32.480
 And what do you think happens after you die?

1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:33.320
 Sure, I'm afraid of it.

1:48:33.320 --> 1:48:37.960
 I mean, because I don't know what's next.

1:48:37.960 --> 1:48:39.920
 I mean, I can't know it the way I know you.

1:48:39.920 --> 1:48:41.600
 So of course I'm afraid of it.

1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:43.520
 And I think of it every day.

1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:44.360
 That's true.

1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:48.440
 My prayer life compels me.

1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:51.360
 We have this, the Hail Mary prayer.

1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:52.560
 So you pray the rosary.

1:48:52.560 --> 1:48:54.320
 Now and at the hour of our death, amen.

1:48:54.320 --> 1:48:56.760
 Now and at the hour of our death, amen.

1:48:56.760 --> 1:48:58.080
 Now at the hour of our death, amen.

1:48:58.080 --> 1:48:59.800
 You pray the whole rosary.

1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:03.440
 50 times you've reminded yourself of your own death.

1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:04.280
 But I do.

1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:06.440
 I think about it because it's the ultimate limit.

1:49:06.440 --> 1:49:08.960
 It's why it's beguiled every artist and writer

1:49:08.960 --> 1:49:09.800
 and philosopher.

1:49:09.800 --> 1:49:12.600
 It's the ultimate limit question.

1:49:12.600 --> 1:49:14.440
 But yeah, sure.

1:49:14.440 --> 1:49:16.800
 I'm afraid of it because it's the unknown.

1:49:17.920 --> 1:49:19.240
 What do I think happens?

1:49:20.800 --> 1:49:25.200
 I think I'm drawn into the deeper embrace of God's love.

1:49:25.200 --> 1:49:29.200
 You know, that's stating it kind of in a more poetic way.

1:49:30.080 --> 1:49:31.840
 Do you know John Polkinghorne's work?

1:49:31.840 --> 1:49:32.960
 Do you know that name?

1:49:32.960 --> 1:49:34.120
 John Polkinghorne was a very interesting,

1:49:34.120 --> 1:49:35.560
 he just died recently.

1:49:35.560 --> 1:49:38.960
 He was a Cambridge University particle physicist, right?

1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:43.120
 High, high level scientist who at midlife

1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:44.440
 became an Anglican priest.

1:49:44.440 --> 1:49:46.800
 He left his job at Cambridge and went to the seminary

1:49:46.800 --> 1:49:48.640
 and became an Anglican priest, right?

1:49:48.640 --> 1:49:50.560
 And then wrote, I think some of the best stuff

1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:51.400
 on science and religion,

1:49:51.400 --> 1:49:54.040
 because he really knew the science from the inside.

1:49:54.040 --> 1:49:55.440
 Here's Polkinghorne's account

1:49:55.440 --> 1:49:58.080
 that I've always found persuasive.

1:49:58.080 --> 1:50:02.600
 He said, what survives after we die?

1:50:02.600 --> 1:50:06.040
 So this body clearly dies and goes into the ground

1:50:06.040 --> 1:50:08.520
 or it's burned up or it goes away, right?

1:50:08.520 --> 1:50:09.480
 But what's preserved?

1:50:09.480 --> 1:50:12.800
 And he says, what Aristotle would have called the form,

1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:14.560
 Polkinghorne calls it the pattern.

1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:18.560
 So the pattern that's organized the matter

1:50:18.560 --> 1:50:20.320
 that's made me up over all these years,

1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:23.160
 that's obviously not the same as it was even,

1:50:23.160 --> 1:50:25.720
 I mean, you would know how often does it all change,

1:50:25.720 --> 1:50:28.360
 all your atoms and cells and, you know.

1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:30.560
 In other words, the little, you know,

1:50:30.560 --> 1:50:33.720
 Bobby Baron who was growing up in Birmingham, Michigan,

1:50:33.720 --> 1:50:36.000
 I can have a picture of him and then there's me.

1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:37.400
 And I say, oh, that's the same person.

1:50:37.400 --> 1:50:40.200
 Well, I mean, clearly not materially speaking, not at all.

1:50:40.200 --> 1:50:41.760
 Completely different.

1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:44.640
 But there's a unity to whatever that pattern is

1:50:44.640 --> 1:50:46.880
 by which all of that materiality

1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:48.640
 has been kind of organized, you know?

1:50:48.640 --> 1:50:53.360
 So Polkinghorne says, I think that pattern is remembered

1:50:53.360 --> 1:50:56.160
 by God and remember it's the wrong word,

1:50:56.160 --> 1:50:57.040
 as though it's like derivative.

1:50:57.040 --> 1:50:59.640
 I mean, it's known by God.

1:50:59.640 --> 1:51:03.480
 And so God can therefore reembody me

1:51:03.480 --> 1:51:06.440
 according to that pattern at a higher pitch,

1:51:06.440 --> 1:51:08.160
 what we call the resurrected body.

1:51:09.320 --> 1:51:12.280
 So Paul talks about a spiritual body,

1:51:12.280 --> 1:51:13.440
 body for sure, I mean,

1:51:13.440 --> 1:51:15.840
 because he believes in the resurrection of Jesus.

1:51:15.840 --> 1:51:19.520
 But it's not a body like ours from this world.

1:51:19.520 --> 1:51:22.120
 It's a body at a higher pitch.

1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:26.200
 So something, some pattern that's there persists.

1:51:26.200 --> 1:51:28.640
 Pattern persists in the mind of God

1:51:28.640 --> 1:51:32.440
 and then is used as the ground of the reembodyment of me.

1:51:32.440 --> 1:51:35.560
 So it's not like I've just become a platonic form.

1:51:35.560 --> 1:51:38.320
 I'm gonna be reembodyed because the Christian hope

1:51:38.320 --> 1:51:42.320
 is not for platonic escape of soul from matter.

1:51:42.320 --> 1:51:43.840
 That's never the Christian hope.

1:51:43.840 --> 1:51:45.760
 It's for the resurrection of the body,

1:51:45.760 --> 1:51:46.920
 we say.

1:51:46.920 --> 1:51:48.960
 And you say, what a fantastic idea.

1:51:48.960 --> 1:51:49.940
 Well, I don't know.

1:51:49.940 --> 1:51:53.520
 I mean, this body is being reconstituted all the time

1:51:53.520 --> 1:51:55.480
 according to this pattern, right?

1:51:55.480 --> 1:51:57.180
 It's not the same matter.

1:51:57.180 --> 1:52:02.180
 And so might there be another sort of higher material

1:52:02.380 --> 1:52:04.960
 that is organized according to the same pattern,

1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:06.680
 which has been remembered by God.

1:52:06.680 --> 1:52:09.380
 So therefore we can hang on to the language of body and soul

1:52:09.380 --> 1:52:11.900
 if you want, or matter and form.

1:52:11.900 --> 1:52:14.600
 But it's the form remembered by God

1:52:14.600 --> 1:52:18.080
 and then reconstituted in an embodied way by God

1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:21.360
 that we call heaven, the heavenly state.

1:52:21.360 --> 1:52:22.680
 That's what I hope for.

1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:26.000
 That's my Christian faith, my Christian hope.

1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:29.800
 Let me ask you about the big question of meaning.

1:52:29.800 --> 1:52:32.360
 We've talked about it in different directions

1:52:32.360 --> 1:52:33.800
 from different perspectives.

1:52:33.800 --> 1:52:36.880
 What's the meaning of our existence here on earth?

1:52:36.880 --> 1:52:39.360
 What's the meaning of life?

1:52:39.360 --> 1:52:40.720
 Love.

1:52:40.720 --> 1:52:42.280
 God is love.

1:52:42.280 --> 1:52:45.040
 And the purpose of my life is to become God's friend.

1:52:45.040 --> 1:52:47.320
 And that means I'm more conformed to love.

1:52:47.320 --> 1:52:49.640
 And so my life finds meaning in the measure

1:52:49.640 --> 1:52:52.980
 that I become more on fire with the divine love.

1:52:52.980 --> 1:52:54.080
 I'm like the burning bush,

1:52:54.080 --> 1:52:57.640
 is to become more and more radiant with the presence of God.

1:52:57.640 --> 1:52:59.760
 That's what gives life meaning.

1:52:59.760 --> 1:53:01.960
 Meaning is to live in a purposive relationship

1:53:01.960 --> 1:53:03.160
 to a value, I would say.

1:53:03.160 --> 1:53:04.920
 So there's all kinds of values,

1:53:04.920 --> 1:53:07.720
 as I say, moral, aesthetic, intellectual values.

1:53:07.720 --> 1:53:09.400
 And when I have a purposive relationship,

1:53:09.400 --> 1:53:10.720
 so right now you and I,

1:53:10.720 --> 1:53:12.800
 we have a purposive relationship to the value of,

1:53:12.800 --> 1:53:15.500
 let's say, finding out the truth of things,

1:53:15.500 --> 1:53:18.060
 and we're speaking together to seek that.

1:53:18.060 --> 1:53:19.200
 Well, good.

1:53:19.200 --> 1:53:20.400
 What's the ultimate value?

1:53:20.400 --> 1:53:22.360
 The value of values is God.

1:53:22.360 --> 1:53:25.520
 The supreme good, the supremely knowable,

1:53:25.520 --> 1:53:27.960
 the supremely intelligible is God.

1:53:27.960 --> 1:53:30.120
 And so to be conformed to God

1:53:30.120 --> 1:53:32.520
 is to have a fully meaningful life.

1:53:32.520 --> 1:53:33.820
 And who's God?

1:53:33.820 --> 1:53:34.940
 God is love.

1:53:34.940 --> 1:53:38.040
 So that's where I would fit the package together that way.

1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:41.240
 You're adding a lot of love to this world,

1:53:41.240 --> 1:53:43.320
 and which is something I deeply appreciate,

1:53:43.320 --> 1:53:45.800
 and that you would sit down with me,

1:53:45.800 --> 1:53:47.320
 given how valuable your time is,

1:53:47.320 --> 1:53:48.160
 is a huge honor.

1:53:48.160 --> 1:53:48.980
 Thank you so much for talking to me.

1:53:48.980 --> 1:53:49.820
 Well, my great pleasure.

1:53:49.820 --> 1:53:50.660
 I loved it.

1:53:50.660 --> 1:53:51.580
 Lex, thank you.

1:53:51.580 --> 1:53:53.080
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

1:53:53.080 --> 1:53:54.640
 with Bishop Robert Barron.

1:53:58.560 --> 1:54:00.840
 And now, let me leave you with some words

1:54:00.840 --> 1:54:03.120
 from Bishop Robert Barron himself,

1:54:03.120 --> 1:54:05.560
 which reminds me of the Dostoevsky line

1:54:05.560 --> 1:54:07.580
 spoken through Prince Mishkin,

1:54:07.580 --> 1:54:10.800
 that quote, beauty will save the world.

1:54:10.800 --> 1:54:14.740
 Robert says, begin with the beautiful,

1:54:14.740 --> 1:54:16.960
 which leads to the good,

1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:19.080
 which leads you to truth.

1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:21.100
 Thank you for listening,

1:54:21.100 --> 1:54:41.100
 and hope to see you next time.
