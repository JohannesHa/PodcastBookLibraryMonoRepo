00:00.000 --> 00:02.360
 The following is a conversation with Peter Wang,

00:02.360 --> 00:04.640
 one of the most impactful leaders and developers

00:04.640 --> 00:06.280
 in the Python community.

00:06.280 --> 00:09.000
 Former physicist, current philosopher,

00:09.000 --> 00:11.600
 and someone who many people told me about

00:11.600 --> 00:14.160
 and praised as a truly special mind

00:14.160 --> 00:16.440
 that I absolutely should talk to.

00:16.440 --> 00:19.400
 Recommendations ranging from Travis Hallifont

00:19.400 --> 00:20.880
 to Eric Weinstein.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.280
 So, here we are.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.560
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.640
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:27.640 --> 00:28.760
 in the description.

00:28.760 --> 00:32.400
 And now, here's my conversation with Peter Wang.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.680
 You're one of the most impactful humans

00:35.680 --> 00:38.280
 in the Python ecosystem.

00:38.280 --> 00:40.880
 So, you're an engineer, leader of engineers,

00:40.880 --> 00:42.920
 but you're also a philosopher.

00:42.920 --> 00:45.160
 So, let's talk both in this conversation

00:45.160 --> 00:47.320
 about programming and philosophy.

00:47.320 --> 00:49.040
 First, programming.

00:49.040 --> 00:51.160
 What to you is the best

00:51.160 --> 00:54.080
 or maybe the most beautiful feature of Python?

00:54.080 --> 00:56.200
 Or maybe the thing that made you fall in love

00:56.200 --> 00:59.000
 or stay in love with Python?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.880
 Well, those are three different things.

01:00.880 --> 01:01.960
 What I think is the most beautiful,

01:01.960 --> 01:03.960
 what made me fall in love, what made me stay in love.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.760
 When I first started using it

01:05.760 --> 01:10.040
 was when I was a C++ computer graphics performance nerd.

01:10.040 --> 01:10.880
 In the 90s?

01:10.880 --> 01:12.080
 Yeah, in the late 90s.

01:12.080 --> 01:14.120
 And that was my first job out of college.

01:15.160 --> 01:18.680
 And we kept trying to do more and more abstract

01:18.680 --> 01:20.520
 and higher order programming in C++,

01:20.520 --> 01:23.040
 which at the time was quite difficult.

01:23.040 --> 01:26.560
 With templates, the compiler support wasn't great, et cetera.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.720
 So, when I started playing around with Python,

01:28.720 --> 01:30.480
 that was my first time encountering

01:30.480 --> 01:33.600
 really first class support for types, for functions,

01:33.600 --> 01:34.440
 and things like that.

01:34.440 --> 01:37.200
 And it felt so incredibly expressive.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.120
 So, that was what kind of made me fall in love

01:39.120 --> 01:39.960
 with it a little bit.

01:39.960 --> 01:42.280
 And also, once you spend a lot of time

01:42.280 --> 01:44.160
 in a C++ dev environment,

01:44.160 --> 01:46.200
 the ability to just whip something together

01:46.200 --> 01:49.680
 that basically runs and works the first time is amazing.

01:49.680 --> 01:51.960
 So, really productive scripting language.

01:51.960 --> 01:55.280
 I mean, I knew Perl, I knew Bash, I was decent at both.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.160
 But Python just made everything,

01:57.160 --> 01:59.680
 it made the whole world accessible.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.240
 I could script this and that and the other,

02:01.240 --> 02:04.000
 network things, little hard drive utilities.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.040
 I could write all of these things

02:05.040 --> 02:06.520
 in the space of an afternoon.

02:06.520 --> 02:07.640
 And that was really, really cool.

02:07.640 --> 02:08.600
 So, that's what made me fall in love.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.560
 Is there something specific you could put your finger on

02:11.560 --> 02:14.080
 that you're not programming in Perl today?

02:14.080 --> 02:17.120
 Like, why Python for scripting?

02:17.120 --> 02:19.640
 I think there's not a specific thing

02:19.640 --> 02:22.800
 as much as the design motif of both the creator

02:22.800 --> 02:25.280
 of the language and the core group of people

02:25.280 --> 02:27.480
 that built the standard library around him.

02:28.920 --> 02:32.160
 There was definitely, there was a taste to it.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.320
 I mean, Steve Jobs used that term

02:34.320 --> 02:35.680
 in somewhat of an arrogant way,

02:35.680 --> 02:37.120
 but I think it's a real thing,

02:37.120 --> 02:39.200
 that it was designed to fit.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.880
 A friend of mine actually expressed this really well.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.960
 He said, Python just fits in my head.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.200
 And there's nothing better to say than that.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.880
 Now, people might argue modern Python,

02:47.880 --> 02:49.240
 there's a lot more complexity,

02:49.240 --> 02:51.760
 but certainly as version 1.5.2,

02:51.760 --> 02:53.360
 I think was my first version,

02:53.360 --> 02:54.800
 that fit in my head very easily.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.560
 So, that's what made me fall in love with it.

02:56.560 --> 03:01.400
 Okay, so the most beautiful feature of Python

03:01.400 --> 03:03.040
 that made you stay in love.

03:03.040 --> 03:06.560
 It's like over the years, what has like,

03:06.560 --> 03:09.520
 you do a double take and you return too often

03:09.520 --> 03:11.560
 as a thing that just brings you a smile.

03:11.560 --> 03:16.560
 I really still like the ability to play with meta classes

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
 and express higher order of things.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.040
 When I have to create some new object model

03:22.040 --> 03:23.360
 to model something, right?

03:23.360 --> 03:24.400
 It's easy for me,

03:24.400 --> 03:27.080
 cause I'm pretty expert as a Python programmer.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.800
 I can easily put all sorts of lovely things together

03:29.800 --> 03:32.920
 and use properties and decorators and other kinds of things

03:32.920 --> 03:34.680
 and create something that feels very nice.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.320
 So, that to me, I would say that's tied

03:37.320 --> 03:40.640
 with the NumPy and vectorization capabilities.

03:40.640 --> 03:43.800
 I love thinking in terms of the matrices and the vectors

03:43.800 --> 03:46.080
 and these kind of data structures.

03:46.080 --> 03:49.400
 So, I would say those two are kind of tied for me.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.720
 So, the elegance of the NumPy data structure,

03:52.720 --> 03:54.760
 like slicing through the different multi dimensional.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.200
 Yeah, there's just enough things there.

03:56.200 --> 04:00.040
 It's like a very, it's a very simple, comfortable tool.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.800
 Just, it's easy to reason about what it does

04:02.800 --> 04:05.000
 when you don't stray too far afield.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.960
 Can you put your finger on how to design a language

04:09.960 --> 04:11.880
 such that it fits in your head?

04:11.880 --> 04:14.040
 Certain things like the colon

04:14.040 --> 04:17.160
 or the certain notation aspects of Python

04:17.160 --> 04:18.640
 that just kind of work.

04:18.640 --> 04:22.200
 Is it something you have to kind of write out on paper,

04:22.200 --> 04:24.640
 look and say, it's just right?

04:24.640 --> 04:27.600
 Is it a taste thing or is there a systematic process?

04:27.600 --> 04:28.800
 What's your sense?

04:28.800 --> 04:31.520
 I think it's more of a taste thing.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.560
 But one thing that should be said

04:33.560 --> 04:36.360
 is that you have to pick your audience, right?

04:36.360 --> 04:39.160
 So, the better defined the user audience is

04:39.160 --> 04:42.280
 or the users are, the easier it is to build something

04:42.280 --> 04:45.200
 that fits in their minds because their needs

04:45.200 --> 04:47.240
 will be more compact and coherent.

04:47.240 --> 04:49.160
 It is possible to find a projection, right?

04:49.160 --> 04:50.920
 A compact projection for their needs.

04:50.920 --> 04:54.480
 The more diverse the user base, the harder that is.

04:54.480 --> 04:57.120
 And so, as Python has grown in popularity,

04:57.120 --> 05:00.080
 that's also naturally created more complexity

05:00.080 --> 05:01.800
 as people try to design any given thing.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.120
 There'll be multiple valid opinions

05:04.120 --> 05:06.240
 about a particular design approach.

05:06.240 --> 05:10.240
 And so, I do think that's the downside of popularity.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.440
 It's almost an intrinsic aspect

05:11.440 --> 05:13.040
 of the complexity of the problem.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.440
 Well, at the very beginning,

05:14.440 --> 05:17.440
 aren't you an audience of one, isn't ultimately,

05:17.440 --> 05:19.480
 aren't all the greatest projects in history

05:19.480 --> 05:21.800
 were just solving a problem that you yourself had?

05:21.800 --> 05:25.400
 Well, so Clay Shirky in his book on crowdsourcing

05:25.400 --> 05:27.520
 or his kind of thoughts on crowdsourcing,

05:27.520 --> 05:29.520
 he identifies the first step of crowdsourcing

05:29.520 --> 05:31.440
 is me first collaboration.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.480
 You first have to make something

05:32.480 --> 05:34.280
 that works well for yourself.

05:34.280 --> 05:37.720
 It's very telling that when you look at all of the impactful

05:37.720 --> 05:40.000
 big project, well, they're fundamental projects now

05:40.000 --> 05:42.560
 in the SciPy and Pydata ecosystem.

05:42.560 --> 05:46.720
 They all started with the people in the domain

05:46.720 --> 05:48.200
 trying to scratch their own itch.

05:48.200 --> 05:49.720
 And the whole idea of scratching your own itch

05:49.720 --> 05:51.280
 is something that the open source

05:51.280 --> 05:53.640
 or the free software world has known for a long time.

05:53.640 --> 05:56.800
 But in the scientific computing areas,

05:56.800 --> 05:58.240
 these are assistant professors

05:58.240 --> 06:00.520
 or electrical engineering grad students.

06:00.520 --> 06:03.000
 They didn't have really a lot of programming skill

06:03.000 --> 06:05.520
 necessarily, but Python was just good enough

06:05.520 --> 06:06.720
 for them to put something together

06:06.720 --> 06:09.400
 that fit in their domain, right?

06:09.400 --> 06:11.120
 So it's almost like a,

06:11.120 --> 06:13.960
 it's a necessity is the mother of invention aspect.

06:13.960 --> 06:16.880
 And also it was a really harsh filter

06:16.880 --> 06:20.880
 for utility and compactness and expressiveness.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.400
 Like it was too hard to use,

06:22.400 --> 06:23.360
 then they wouldn't have built it

06:23.360 --> 06:24.960
 because that was just too much trouble, right?

06:24.960 --> 06:26.160
 It was a side project for them.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.120
 And also necessity creates a kind of deadline.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.440
 It seems like a lot of these projects

06:29.440 --> 06:32.320
 are quickly thrown together in the first step.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.520
 And that, even though it's flawed,

06:35.560 --> 06:38.840
 that just seems to work well for software projects.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.280
 Well, it does work well for software projects in general.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.520
 And in this particular space,

06:43.520 --> 06:46.320
 one of my colleagues, Stan Siebert identified this,

06:46.320 --> 06:49.080
 that all the projects in the SciPy ecosystem,

06:50.360 --> 06:51.200
 if we just rattle them off,

06:51.200 --> 06:53.040
 there's NumPy, there's SciPy

06:53.040 --> 06:55.000
 built by different collaborations of people.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.680
 Although Travis is the heart of both of them.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.360
 But NumPy coming from numeric and numery,

06:59.360 --> 07:00.680
 these are different people.

07:00.680 --> 07:01.840
 And then you've got Pandas,

07:01.840 --> 07:04.480
 you've got Jupyter or IPython,

07:04.480 --> 07:06.880
 there's Matplotlib,

07:06.880 --> 07:09.680
 there's just so many others, I'm not gonna do justice

07:09.680 --> 07:10.720
 if I try to name them all.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.800
 But all of them are actually different people.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.280
 And as they rolled out their projects,

07:15.280 --> 07:17.560
 the fact that they had limited resources

07:17.560 --> 07:19.520
 meant that they were humble about scope.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.560
 A great famous hacker, Jamie Zawisky,

07:23.560 --> 07:26.040
 once said that every geek's dream

07:26.040 --> 07:29.280
 is to build the ultimate middleware, right?

07:29.280 --> 07:32.280
 And the thing is with these scientists turned programmers,

07:32.280 --> 07:33.120
 they had no such dream.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.800
 They were just trying to write something

07:34.800 --> 07:36.560
 that was a little bit better for what they needed,

07:36.560 --> 07:37.640
 the MATLAB,

07:37.640 --> 07:39.920
 and they were gonna leverage what everyone else had built.

07:39.920 --> 07:42.640
 So naturally, almost in kind of this annealing process

07:42.640 --> 07:46.480
 or whatever, we built a very modular cover

07:46.480 --> 07:50.280
 of the basic needs of a scientific computing library.

07:50.280 --> 07:51.920
 If you look at the whole human story,

07:51.920 --> 07:53.680
 how much of a leap is it?

07:53.680 --> 07:55.480
 We've developed all kinds of languages,

07:55.480 --> 07:57.720
 all kinds of methodologies for communication.

07:57.720 --> 08:00.560
 It just kind of like grew this collective intelligence,

08:00.560 --> 08:04.400
 civilization grew, it expanded, wrote a bunch of books,

08:04.400 --> 08:08.680
 and now we tweet how big of a leap is programming

08:08.680 --> 08:10.880
 if programming is yet another language?

08:10.880 --> 08:12.880
 Is it just a nice little trick

08:12.880 --> 08:15.000
 that's temporary in our human history,

08:15.000 --> 08:18.800
 or is it like a big leap in the,

08:19.680 --> 08:23.120
 almost us becoming another organism

08:23.120 --> 08:26.160
 at a higher level of abstraction, something else?

08:26.160 --> 08:28.240
 I think the act of programming

08:28.240 --> 08:32.360
 or using grammatical constructions

08:32.360 --> 08:34.920
 of some underlying primitives,

08:34.920 --> 08:37.520
 that is something that humans do learn,

08:37.520 --> 08:38.840
 but every human learns this.

08:38.840 --> 08:41.160
 Anyone who can speak learns how to do this.

08:41.160 --> 08:42.440
 What makes programming different

08:42.440 --> 08:44.840
 has been that up to this point,

08:44.840 --> 08:49.000
 when we try to give instructions to computing systems,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.560
 all of our computers, well, actually this is not quite true,

08:51.560 --> 08:53.080
 but I'll first say it,

08:53.080 --> 08:55.000
 and then I'll tell you why it's not true.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
 But for the most part,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.880
 we can think of computers as being these iterated systems.

08:58.880 --> 08:59.920
 So when we program,

08:59.920 --> 09:04.200
 we're giving very precise instructions to iterated systems

09:04.200 --> 09:07.360
 that then run at incomprehensible speed

09:07.360 --> 09:08.800
 and run those instructions.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.160
 In my experience,

09:10.160 --> 09:12.720
 some people are just better equipped

09:12.720 --> 09:16.880
 to model systematic iterated systems,

09:16.880 --> 09:19.120
 well, whatever, iterated systems in their head.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.760
 Some people are really good at that,

09:21.760 --> 09:23.800
 and other people are not.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.080
 And so when you have like, for instance,

09:26.080 --> 09:27.640
 sometimes people have tried to build systems

09:27.640 --> 09:30.080
 that make programming easier by making it visual,

09:30.080 --> 09:31.240
 drag and drop.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.640
 And the issue is you can have a drag and drop thing,

09:33.640 --> 09:35.200
 but once you start having to iterate the system

09:35.200 --> 09:36.120
 with conditional logic,

09:36.120 --> 09:37.880
 handling case statements and branch statements

09:37.880 --> 09:39.480
 and all these other things,

09:39.480 --> 09:42.040
 the visual drag and drop part doesn't save you anything.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.680
 You still have to reason about this giant iterated system

09:44.680 --> 09:46.360
 with all these different conditions around it.

09:46.360 --> 09:48.160
 That's the hard part, right?

09:48.160 --> 09:52.240
 So handling iterated logic, that's the hard part.

09:52.240 --> 09:54.160
 The languages we use then emerge

09:54.160 --> 09:57.240
 to give us the ability and capability over these things.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.880
 Now, the one exception to this rule, of course,

09:58.880 --> 10:00.680
 is the most popular programming system in the world,

10:00.680 --> 10:03.280
 which is Excel, which is a data flow

10:03.280 --> 10:05.440
 and a data driven, immediate mode,

10:05.440 --> 10:08.360
 data transformation oriented programming system.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.400
 And this actually not an accident

10:10.400 --> 10:12.840
 that that system is the most popular programming system

10:12.840 --> 10:14.440
 because it's so accessible

10:14.440 --> 10:16.920
 to a much broader group of people.

10:16.920 --> 10:21.240
 I do think as we build future computing systems,

10:21.240 --> 10:22.920
 you're actually already seeing this a little bit,

10:22.920 --> 10:25.680
 it's much more about composition of modular blocks.

10:25.680 --> 10:29.600
 They themselves actually maintain all their internal state

10:29.600 --> 10:31.040
 and the interfaces between them

10:31.040 --> 10:32.960
 are well defined data schemas.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.880
 And so to stitch these things together using like IFTTT

10:35.880 --> 10:38.720
 or Zapier or any of these kind of,

10:38.720 --> 10:42.000
 I would say compositional scripting kinds of things,

10:42.000 --> 10:44.960
 I mean, HyperCard was also a little bit in this vein.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.560
 That's much more accessible to most people.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.920
 It's really that implicit state

10:49.920 --> 10:52.000
 that's so hard for people to track.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.400
 Yeah, okay, so that's modular stuff,

10:53.400 --> 10:54.440
 but there's also an aspect

10:54.440 --> 10:55.920
 where you're standing on the shoulders of giants.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.720
 So you're building like higher and higher levels

10:58.720 --> 11:02.160
 of abstraction, but you do that a little bit with language.

11:02.160 --> 11:05.160
 So with language, you develop sort of ideas,

11:05.160 --> 11:07.600
 philosophies from Plato and so on.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.520
 And then you kind of leverage those philosophies

11:09.520 --> 11:12.640
 as you try to have deeper and deeper conversations.

11:12.640 --> 11:13.560
 But with programming,

11:13.560 --> 11:17.040
 it seems like you can build much more complicated systems.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.920
 Like without knowing how everything works,

11:18.920 --> 11:21.320
 you can build on top of the work of others.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.840
 And it seems like you're developing

11:22.840 --> 11:27.840
 more and more sophisticated expressions,

11:27.920 --> 11:31.280
 ability to express ideas in a computational space.

11:31.280 --> 11:35.040
 I think it's worth pondering the difference here

11:35.040 --> 11:38.640
 between complexity and complication.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.240
 Okay, right. Back to Excel.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.280
 Well, not quite back to Excel,

11:43.280 --> 11:47.560
 but the idea is when we have a human conversation,

11:47.560 --> 11:51.240
 all languages for humans emerged

11:51.240 --> 11:55.560
 to support human relational communications,

11:55.560 --> 11:57.720
 which is that the person we're communicating with

11:57.720 --> 12:01.240
 is a person and they would communicate back to us.

12:01.240 --> 12:05.640
 And so we sort of hit a resonance point, right?

12:05.640 --> 12:07.480
 When we actually agree on some concepts.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.280
 So there's a messiness to it and there's a fluidity to it.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.880
 With computing systems,

12:11.880 --> 12:14.280
 when we express something to the computer and it's wrong,

12:14.280 --> 12:15.400
 we just try again.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.520
 So we can basically live many virtual worlds

12:17.520 --> 12:20.200
 of having failed at expressing ourselves to the computer

12:20.200 --> 12:22.840
 until the one time we expressed ourselves right.

12:22.840 --> 12:23.960
 Then we kind of put in production

12:23.960 --> 12:25.920
 and then discover that it's still wrong

12:25.920 --> 12:27.160
 a few days down the road.

12:27.160 --> 12:30.480
 So I think the sophistication of things

12:30.480 --> 12:32.520
 that we build with computing,

12:32.520 --> 12:35.600
 one has to really pay attention to the difference

12:35.600 --> 12:38.240
 between when an end user is expressing something

12:38.240 --> 12:39.960
 onto a system that exists

12:39.960 --> 12:42.520
 versus when they're extending the system

12:42.520 --> 12:45.480
 to increase the system's capability

12:45.480 --> 12:47.480
 for someone else to then interface with.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.560
 We happen to use the same language for both of those things

12:49.560 --> 12:52.080
 in most cases, but it doesn't have to be that.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.360
 And Excel is actually a great example of this,

12:54.360 --> 12:56.240
 of kind of a counterpoint to that.

12:56.240 --> 13:00.600
 Okay, so what about the idea of, you said messiness.

13:01.440 --> 13:06.240
 Wouldn't you put the software 2.0 idea,

13:06.240 --> 13:07.760
 this idea of machine learning

13:08.720 --> 13:12.560
 into the further and further steps

13:12.560 --> 13:14.560
 into the world of messiness.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.640
 The same kind of beautiful messiness of human communication.

13:17.640 --> 13:19.120
 Isn't that what machine learning is?

13:19.120 --> 13:23.560
 Is building on levels of abstraction

13:23.560 --> 13:25.520
 that don't have messiness in them,

13:25.520 --> 13:27.400
 that at the operating system level,

13:27.400 --> 13:29.400
 then there's Python, the programming languages

13:29.400 --> 13:30.920
 that have more and more power.

13:30.920 --> 13:34.640
 But then finally, there's neural networks

13:34.640 --> 13:38.200
 that ultimately work with data.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.560
 And so the programming is almost in the space of data

13:40.560 --> 13:42.480
 and the data is allowed to be messy.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.880
 Isn't that a kind of program?

13:43.880 --> 13:47.360
 So the idea of software 2.0 is a lot of the programming

13:47.360 --> 13:52.320
 happens in the space of data, so back to Excel,

13:52.320 --> 13:55.080
 all roads lead back to Excel, in the space of data

13:55.080 --> 13:57.400
 and also the hyperparameters of the neural networks.

13:57.400 --> 14:02.240
 And all of those allow the same kind of messiness

14:02.240 --> 14:04.400
 that human communication allows.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.760
 It does, but my background is in physics.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.960
 I took like two CS courses in college.

14:09.960 --> 14:13.800
 So I don't have, now I did cram a bunch of CS in prep

14:13.800 --> 14:15.520
 when I applied for grad school,

14:15.520 --> 14:18.160
 but still I don't have a formal background

14:18.160 --> 14:19.720
 in computer science.

14:19.720 --> 14:22.520
 But what I have observed in studying programming languages

14:22.520 --> 14:25.000
 and programming systems and things like that

14:25.000 --> 14:27.360
 is that there seems to be this triangle.

14:27.360 --> 14:30.440
 It's one of these beautiful little iron triangles

14:30.440 --> 14:32.080
 that you find in life sometimes.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.640
 And it's the connection between the code correctness

14:35.640 --> 14:37.440
 and kind of expressiveness of code,

14:37.440 --> 14:39.920
 the semantics of the data,

14:39.920 --> 14:42.520
 and then the kind of correctness or parameters

14:42.520 --> 14:44.960
 of the underlying hardware compute system.

14:44.960 --> 14:48.440
 So there's the algorithms that you wanna apply,

14:48.440 --> 14:52.440
 there's what the bits that are stored on whatever media

14:52.440 --> 14:55.800
 actually represent, so the semantics of the data

14:55.800 --> 14:56.920
 within the representation,

14:56.920 --> 14:59.760
 and then there's what the computer can actually do.

14:59.760 --> 15:02.840
 And every programming system, every information system

15:02.840 --> 15:05.480
 ultimately finds some spot in the middle

15:05.480 --> 15:07.440
 of this little triangle.

15:07.440 --> 15:11.120
 Sometimes some systems collapse them into just one edge.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.480
 Are we including humans as a system in this?

15:13.480 --> 15:15.960
 No, no, I'm just thinking about computing systems here.

15:15.960 --> 15:17.800
 And the reason I bring this up is because

15:17.800 --> 15:20.120
 I believe there's no free lunch around this stuff.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.000
 So if we build machine learning systems

15:23.000 --> 15:25.520
 to sort of write the correct code

15:25.520 --> 15:27.160
 that is at a certain level of performance,

15:27.160 --> 15:30.120
 so it'll sort of select with hyperparameters

15:30.120 --> 15:32.880
 we can tune kind of how we want the performance boundary

15:32.880 --> 15:37.280
 in SLA to look like for transforming some set of inputs

15:37.280 --> 15:39.600
 into certain kinds of outputs.

15:39.600 --> 15:43.640
 That training process itself is intrinsically sensitive

15:43.640 --> 15:45.560
 to the kinds of inputs we put into it.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.960
 It's quite sensitive to the boundary conditions

15:47.960 --> 15:49.320
 we put around the performance.

15:49.320 --> 15:52.200
 So I think even as we move to using automated systems

15:52.200 --> 15:53.480
 to build this transformation,

15:53.480 --> 15:55.480
 as opposed to humans explicitly

15:55.480 --> 15:57.360
 from a top down perspective, figuring out,

15:57.360 --> 15:59.960
 well, this schema and this database and these columns

15:59.960 --> 16:01.720
 get selected for this algorithm,

16:01.720 --> 16:04.880
 and here we put a Fibonacci heap for some other thing.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.800
 Human design or computer design,

16:06.800 --> 16:08.160
 ultimately what we hit,

16:08.160 --> 16:10.640
 the boundaries that we hit with these information systems

16:10.640 --> 16:14.240
 is when the representation of the data hits the real world

16:14.240 --> 16:17.560
 is where there's a lot of slop and a lot of interpretation.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.960
 And that's where actually I think

16:18.960 --> 16:20.880
 a lot of the work will go in the future

16:20.880 --> 16:23.360
 is actually understanding kind of how to better

16:23.360 --> 16:26.240
 in the view of these live data systems,

16:26.240 --> 16:29.320
 how to better encode the semantics of the world

16:29.320 --> 16:30.160
 for those things.

16:30.160 --> 16:31.080
 There'll be less of the details

16:31.080 --> 16:33.480
 of how we write a particular SQL query.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.520
 Okay, but given the semantics of the real world

16:35.520 --> 16:36.920
 and the messiness of that,

16:36.920 --> 16:38.640
 what does the word correctness mean

16:38.640 --> 16:40.800
 when you're talking about code?

16:40.800 --> 16:42.960
 There's a lot of dimensions to correctness.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.160
 Historically, and this is one of the reasons I say

16:45.160 --> 16:47.640
 that we're coming to the end of the era of software,

16:47.640 --> 16:49.880
 because for the last 40 years or so,

16:49.880 --> 16:52.440
 software correctness was really defined

16:52.440 --> 16:54.840
 about functional correctness.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.400
 I write a function, it's got some inputs,

16:56.400 --> 16:57.880
 does it produce the right outputs?

16:57.880 --> 16:59.280
 If so, then I can turn it on,

16:59.280 --> 17:01.480
 hook it up to the live database and it goes.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.200
 And more and more now we have,

17:03.200 --> 17:05.120
 I mean, in fact, I think the bright line in the sand

17:05.120 --> 17:06.800
 between machine learning systems

17:06.800 --> 17:08.200
 or modern data driven systems

17:08.200 --> 17:10.840
 versus classical software systems

17:10.840 --> 17:14.320
 is that the values of the input

17:14.320 --> 17:17.440
 actually have to be considered with the function together

17:17.440 --> 17:19.480
 to say this whole thing is correct or not.

17:19.480 --> 17:21.840
 And usually there's a performance SLA as well.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.160
 Like did it actually finish making this?

17:23.160 --> 17:24.000
 What's SLA?

17:24.000 --> 17:25.440
 Sorry, service level agreement.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.120
 So it has to return within some time.

17:27.120 --> 17:29.240
 You have a 10 millisecond time budget

17:29.240 --> 17:32.760
 to return a prediction of this level of accuracy, right?

17:32.760 --> 17:35.040
 So these are things that were not traditionally

17:35.040 --> 17:37.560
 in most business computing systems for the last 20 years

17:37.560 --> 17:39.400
 at all, people didn't think about it.

17:39.400 --> 17:42.720
 But now we have value dependence on functional correctness.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.160
 So that question of correctness

17:44.160 --> 17:45.760
 is becoming a bigger and bigger question.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.160
 What does that map to the end of software?

17:48.160 --> 17:50.520
 We've thought about software as just this thing

17:50.520 --> 17:54.760
 that you can do in isolation with some test trial inputs

17:54.760 --> 17:58.640
 and in a very sort of sandboxed environment.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.640
 And we can quantify how does it scale?

18:00.640 --> 18:02.040
 How does it perform?

18:02.040 --> 18:03.240
 How many nodes do we need to allocate

18:03.240 --> 18:05.120
 if we wanna scale this many inputs?

18:05.120 --> 18:08.360
 When we start turning this stuff into prediction systems,

18:08.360 --> 18:10.120
 real cybernetic systems,

18:10.120 --> 18:12.320
 you're going to find scenarios where you get inputs

18:12.320 --> 18:13.160
 that you're gonna wanna spend

18:13.160 --> 18:14.560
 a little more time thinking about.

18:14.560 --> 18:15.840
 You're gonna find inputs that are not,

18:15.840 --> 18:17.480
 it's not clear what you should do, right?

18:17.480 --> 18:20.360
 So then the software has a varying amount of runtime

18:20.360 --> 18:22.280
 and correctness with regard to input.

18:22.280 --> 18:24.000
 And that is a different kind of system altogether.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.960
 Now it's a full on cybernetic system.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.640
 It's a next generation information system

18:27.640 --> 18:30.200
 that is not like traditional software systems.

18:30.200 --> 18:33.160
 Can you maybe describe what is a cybernetic system?

18:33.160 --> 18:35.080
 Do you include humans in that picture?

18:35.080 --> 18:38.920
 So is a human in the loop kind of complex mess

18:38.920 --> 18:41.520
 of the whole kind of interactivity of software

18:41.520 --> 18:44.760
 with the real world or is it something more concrete?

18:44.760 --> 18:45.760
 Well, when I say cybernetic,

18:45.760 --> 18:47.720
 I really do mean that the software itself

18:47.720 --> 18:51.600
 is closing the observe, orient, decide, act loop by itself.

18:51.600 --> 18:54.280
 So humans being out of the loop is the fact

18:54.280 --> 18:58.440
 what for me makes it a cybernetic system.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.920
 And humans are out of that loop.

19:00.920 --> 19:01.960
 When humans are out of the loop,

19:01.960 --> 19:05.240
 when the machine is actually sort of deciding on its own

19:05.240 --> 19:07.680
 what it should do next to get more information,

19:07.680 --> 19:09.760
 that makes it a cybernetic system.

19:09.760 --> 19:11.400
 So we're just at the dawn of this, right?

19:11.400 --> 19:15.400
 I think everyone talking about MLAI, it's great.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.880
 But really the thing we should be talking about

19:16.880 --> 19:20.360
 is when we really enter the cybernetic era

19:20.360 --> 19:22.520
 and all of the questions of ethics and governance

19:22.520 --> 19:24.640
 and all correctness and all these things,

19:24.640 --> 19:27.200
 they really are the most important questions.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.600
 Okay, can we just linger on this?

19:28.600 --> 19:30.640
 What does it mean for the human to be out of the loop

19:30.640 --> 19:34.120
 in a cybernetic system, because isn't the cybernetic system

19:34.120 --> 19:37.440
 that's ultimately accomplishing some kind of purpose

19:37.440 --> 19:41.840
 that at the bottom, the turtles all the way down,

19:41.840 --> 19:44.240
 at the bottom turtle is a human.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.920
 Well, the human may have set some criteria,

19:45.920 --> 19:47.280
 but the human wasn't precise.

19:47.280 --> 19:49.240
 So for instance, I just read the other day

19:49.240 --> 19:51.360
 that earlier this year,

19:51.360 --> 19:52.480
 or maybe it was last year at some point,

19:52.480 --> 19:55.240
 the Libyan army, I think,

19:55.240 --> 19:58.200
 sent out some automated killer drones with explosives.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.000
 And there was no human in the loop at that point.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.280
 They basically put them in a geofenced area,

20:02.280 --> 20:04.280
 said find any moving target, like a truck or vehicle

20:04.280 --> 20:05.840
 that looks like this, and boom.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.360
 That's not a human in the loop, right?

20:09.360 --> 20:12.760
 So increasingly, the less human there is in the loop,

20:12.760 --> 20:15.520
 the more concerned you are about these kinds of systems,

20:15.520 --> 20:18.360
 because there's unintended consequences,

20:18.360 --> 20:22.000
 like less the original designer and engineer of the system

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
 is able to predict, even one with good intent

20:25.000 --> 20:27.400
 is able to predict the consequences of such a system.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.680
 Is that it? That's right.

20:28.680 --> 20:30.160
 There are some software systems, right,

20:30.160 --> 20:31.920
 that run without humans in the loop

20:31.920 --> 20:32.800
 that are quite complex.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.320
 And that's like the electronic markets.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.920
 And we get flash crashes all the time.

20:35.920 --> 20:40.440
 We get in the heyday of high frequency trading,

20:40.440 --> 20:41.800
 there's a lot of market microstructure,

20:41.800 --> 20:43.600
 people doing all sorts of weird stuff

20:43.600 --> 20:47.240
 that the market designers had never really thought about,

20:47.240 --> 20:48.840
 contemplated or intended.

20:48.840 --> 20:50.680
 So when we run these full on systems

20:50.680 --> 20:52.840
 with these automated trading bots,

20:52.840 --> 20:55.440
 now they become automated killer drones

20:55.440 --> 20:57.280
 and then all sorts of other stuff.

20:57.280 --> 20:59.560
 We are, that's what I mean by we're at the dawn

20:59.560 --> 21:01.600
 of the cybernetic era and the end of the era

21:01.600 --> 21:02.760
 of just pure software.

21:03.880 --> 21:06.000
 Are you more concerned,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.280
 if you're thinking about cybernetic systems

21:08.280 --> 21:10.040
 or even like self replicating systems,

21:10.040 --> 21:13.560
 so systems that aren't just doing a particular task,

21:13.560 --> 21:15.720
 but are able to sort of multiply and scale

21:15.720 --> 21:18.040
 in some dimension in the digital

21:18.040 --> 21:20.360
 or even the physical world.

21:20.360 --> 21:24.800
 Are you more concerned about like the lobster being boiled?

21:24.800 --> 21:27.360
 So a gradual with us not noticing,

21:29.160 --> 21:33.280
 collapse of civilization or a big explosion,

21:34.320 --> 21:38.680
 like oops, kind of a big thing where everyone notices,

21:38.680 --> 21:40.160
 but it's too late.

21:40.160 --> 21:44.040
 I think that it will be a different experience

21:44.040 --> 21:45.040
 for different people.

21:46.280 --> 21:49.800
 I do share a common point of view

21:49.800 --> 21:51.160
 with some of the climate,

21:52.240 --> 21:53.760
 people who are concerned about climate change

21:53.760 --> 21:58.760
 and just the big existential risks that we have.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.560
 But unlike a lot of people who share my level of concern,

22:02.560 --> 22:06.200
 I think the collapse will not be quite so dramatic

22:06.200 --> 22:07.560
 as some of them think.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.200
 And what I mean is that,

22:09.200 --> 22:12.320
 I think that for certain tiers of let's say economic class

22:12.320 --> 22:14.640
 or certain locations in the world,

22:14.640 --> 22:17.760
 people will experience dramatic collapse scenarios.

22:17.760 --> 22:20.320
 But for a lot of people, especially in the developed world,

22:20.320 --> 22:24.040
 the realities of collapse will be managed.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.640
 There'll be narrative management around it

22:26.640 --> 22:29.160
 so that they essentially insulate,

22:29.160 --> 22:31.320
 the middle class will be used to insulate the upper class

22:31.320 --> 22:35.880
 from the pitchforks and the flaming torches and everything.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.000
 It's interesting because,

22:37.000 --> 22:39.600
 so my specific question wasn't as general.

22:39.600 --> 22:42.480
 My question was more about cybernetic systems or software.

22:42.480 --> 22:43.560
 Okay.

22:43.560 --> 22:44.400
 It's interesting,

22:44.400 --> 22:46.720
 but it would nevertheless perhaps be about class.

22:46.720 --> 22:48.360
 So the effect of algorithms

22:48.360 --> 22:50.200
 might affect certain classes more than others.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.040
 Absolutely.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.680
 I was more thinking about

22:52.680 --> 22:56.160
 whether it's social media algorithms or actual robots,

22:57.320 --> 23:00.000
 is there going to be a gradual effect on us

23:00.000 --> 23:02.600
 where we wake up one day

23:02.600 --> 23:05.160
 and don't recognize the humans we are,

23:05.160 --> 23:07.560
 or is it something truly dramatic

23:07.560 --> 23:11.640
 where there's like a meltdown of a nuclear reactor

23:11.640 --> 23:15.240
 kind of thing, Chernobyl, like catastrophic events

23:15.240 --> 23:20.240
 that are almost bugs in a program that scaled itself

23:20.280 --> 23:21.120
 too quickly?

23:21.120 --> 23:26.120
 Yeah, I'm not as concerned about the visible stuff.

23:26.280 --> 23:29.560
 And the reason is because the big visible explosions,

23:29.560 --> 23:31.200
 I mean, this is something I said about social media

23:31.200 --> 23:33.200
 is that at least with nuclear weapons,

23:33.200 --> 23:34.840
 when a nuke goes off, you can see it

23:34.840 --> 23:36.360
 and you're like, well, that's really,

23:36.360 --> 23:37.760
 wow, that's kind of bad, right?

23:37.760 --> 23:40.640
 I mean, Oppenheimer was reciting the Bhagavad Gita, right?

23:40.640 --> 23:42.200
 When he saw one of those things go off.

23:42.200 --> 23:45.160
 So we can see nukes are really bad.

23:45.160 --> 23:48.000
 He's not reciting anything about Twitter.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.160
 Well, but right, but then when you have social media,

23:51.160 --> 23:54.400
 when you have all these different things that conspire

23:54.400 --> 23:57.120
 to create a layer of virtual experience for people

23:57.120 --> 24:00.960
 that alienates them from reality and from each other,

24:00.960 --> 24:03.840
 that's very pernicious, that's impossible to see, right?

24:03.840 --> 24:07.160
 And it kind of slowly gets in there, so.

24:07.160 --> 24:09.600
 You've written about this idea of virtuality

24:09.600 --> 24:14.120
 on this topic, which you define as the subjective phenomenon

24:14.120 --> 24:17.800
 of knowingly engaging with virtual sensation and perception

24:17.800 --> 24:19.920
 and suspending or forgetting the context

24:19.920 --> 24:22.040
 that it's simulacrum.

24:22.040 --> 24:26.440
 So let me ask, what is real?

24:26.440 --> 24:30.440
 Is there a hard line between reality and virtuality?

24:30.440 --> 24:33.440
 Like perception drifts from some kind of physical reality.

24:33.440 --> 24:36.120
 We have to kind of have a sense of what is the line

24:36.120 --> 24:37.640
 that's too, we've gone too far.

24:37.640 --> 24:38.760
 Right, right.

24:38.760 --> 24:42.640
 For me, it's not about any hard line about physical reality

24:42.640 --> 24:46.200
 as much as a simple question of,

24:47.160 --> 24:51.560
 does the particular technology help people connect

24:51.560 --> 24:54.400
 in a more integral way with other people,

24:54.400 --> 24:56.000
 with their environment,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.560
 with all of the full spectrum of things around them?

24:58.560 --> 25:00.880
 So it's less about, oh, this is a virtual thing

25:00.880 --> 25:03.000
 and this is a hard real thing,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.760
 more about when we create virtual representations

25:05.760 --> 25:09.360
 of the real things, always some things

25:09.360 --> 25:10.760
 are lost in translation.

25:10.760 --> 25:14.320
 Usually many, many dimensions are lost in translation.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.840
 We're now coming to almost two years of COVID,

25:16.840 --> 25:17.920
 people on Zoom all the time.

25:17.920 --> 25:19.760
 You know it's different when you meet somebody in person

25:19.760 --> 25:20.600
 than when you see them on,

25:20.600 --> 25:22.560
 I've seen you on YouTube lots, right?

25:22.560 --> 25:24.200
 But then seeing a person is very different.

25:24.200 --> 25:29.200
 And so I think when we engage in virtual experiences

25:29.760 --> 25:31.680
 all the time, and we only do that,

25:31.680 --> 25:34.280
 there is absolutely a level of embodiment.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.560
 There's a level of embodied experience

25:36.560 --> 25:40.080
 and participatory interaction that is lost.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.520
 And it's very hard to put your finger on exactly what it is.

25:42.520 --> 25:44.600
 It's hard to say, oh, we're gonna spend $100 million

25:44.600 --> 25:49.480
 building a new system that captures this 5% better,

25:49.480 --> 25:51.240
 higher fidelity human expression.

25:51.240 --> 25:52.600
 No one's gonna pay for that, right?

25:52.600 --> 25:57.480
 So when we rush madly into a world of simulacrum

25:57.480 --> 26:02.480
 and virtuality, the things that are lost are,

26:02.560 --> 26:04.240
 it's difficult.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.400
 Once everyone moves there, it can be hard to look back

26:06.400 --> 26:08.120
 and see what we've lost.

26:08.120 --> 26:10.400
 So is it irrecoverably lost?

26:10.400 --> 26:14.200
 Or rather, when you put it all on the table,

26:14.200 --> 26:17.160
 is it possible for more to be gained than is lost?

26:17.160 --> 26:18.680
 If you look at video games,

26:18.680 --> 26:22.720
 they create virtual experiences that are surreal

26:22.720 --> 26:24.480
 and can bring joy to a lot of people,

26:24.480 --> 26:26.680
 can connect a lot of people,

26:26.680 --> 26:29.880
 and can get people to talk a lot of trash.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.600
 So they can bring out the best and the worst in people.

26:32.600 --> 26:35.720
 So is it possible to have a future world

26:35.720 --> 26:38.560
 where the pros outweigh the cons?

26:38.560 --> 26:39.400
 It is.

26:39.400 --> 26:41.560
 I mean, it's possible to have that in the current world.

26:41.560 --> 26:46.560
 But when literally trillions of dollars of capital

26:46.600 --> 26:48.920
 are tied to using those things

26:48.920 --> 26:52.840
 to groom the worst of our inclinations

26:52.840 --> 26:56.080
 and to attack our weaknesses in the limbic system

26:56.080 --> 26:57.640
 to create these things into id machines

26:57.640 --> 26:59.120
 versus connection machines,

26:59.120 --> 27:03.200
 then those good things don't stand a chance.

27:03.200 --> 27:06.640
 Can you make a lot of money by building connection machines?

27:06.640 --> 27:08.360
 Is it possible, do you think,

27:09.280 --> 27:10.920
 to bring out the best in human nature

27:10.920 --> 27:13.720
 to create fulfilling connections and relationships

27:13.720 --> 27:17.040
 in the digital world and make a shit ton of money?

27:18.720 --> 27:21.120
 If I figure it out, I'll let you know.

27:21.120 --> 27:22.000
 But what's your intuition

27:22.000 --> 27:24.640
 without concretely knowing what's the solution?

27:24.640 --> 27:27.720
 My intuition is that a lot of our digital technologies

27:27.720 --> 27:30.800
 give us the ability to have synthetic connections

27:30.800 --> 27:33.040
 or to experience virtuality.

27:33.040 --> 27:38.040
 They have co evolved with sort of the human expectations.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.840
 It's sort of like sugary drinks.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.320
 As people have more sugary drinks,

27:42.320 --> 27:45.880
 they need more sugary drinks to get that same hit, right?

27:45.880 --> 27:50.400
 So with these virtual things and with TV and fast cuts

27:50.400 --> 27:52.840
 and TikToks and all these different kinds of things,

27:52.840 --> 27:55.040
 we're co creating essentially humanity

27:55.040 --> 27:57.320
 that sort of asks and needs those things.

27:57.320 --> 27:58.880
 And now it becomes very difficult

27:58.880 --> 28:00.360
 to get people to slow down.

28:00.360 --> 28:03.520
 It gets difficult for people to hold their attention

28:03.520 --> 28:07.320
 on slow things and actually feel that embodied experience.

28:07.320 --> 28:11.120
 So mindfulness now more than ever is so important in schools

28:11.120 --> 28:13.560
 and as a therapy technique for people

28:13.560 --> 28:15.680
 because our environment has been accelerated.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.360
 And McLuhan actually talks about this

28:17.360 --> 28:19.520
 in the electric environment of the television.

28:19.520 --> 28:22.440
 And that was before TikTok and before front facing cameras.

28:22.440 --> 28:25.360
 So I think for me, the concern is that

28:25.360 --> 28:28.160
 it's not like we can ever switch to doing something better,

28:28.160 --> 28:32.080
 but more of the humans and technology,

28:32.080 --> 28:33.560
 they're not independent of each other.

28:33.560 --> 28:37.760
 The technology that we use kind of molds what we need

28:37.760 --> 28:39.120
 for the next generation of technology.

28:39.120 --> 28:43.360
 Yeah, but humans are intelligent and they're introspective

28:43.360 --> 28:45.840
 and they can reflect on the experiences of their life.

28:45.840 --> 28:47.880
 So for example, there's been many years in my life

28:47.880 --> 28:50.920
 where I ate an excessive amount of sugar.

28:50.920 --> 28:53.680
 And then a certain moment I woke up and said,

28:54.840 --> 28:55.920
 why do I keep doing this?

28:55.920 --> 28:57.680
 This doesn't feel good.

28:57.680 --> 28:59.000
 Like longterm.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.320
 And I think, so going through the TikTok process

29:02.320 --> 29:06.280
 of realizing, okay, when I shorten my attention span,

29:06.280 --> 29:10.240
 actually that does not make me feel good longer term.

29:10.240 --> 29:13.160
 And realizing that and then going to platforms,

29:13.160 --> 29:18.160
 going to places that are away from the sugar.

29:18.280 --> 29:21.080
 So in so doing, you can create platforms

29:21.080 --> 29:24.000
 that can make a lot of money to help people wake up

29:24.000 --> 29:26.280
 to what actually makes them feel good longterm.

29:26.280 --> 29:28.280
 Develop, grow as human beings.

29:28.280 --> 29:31.040
 And it just feels like humans are more intelligent

29:31.040 --> 29:35.120
 than mice looking for cheese.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.960
 They're able to sort of think, I mean,

29:36.960 --> 29:39.720
 we can contemplate our own mortality.

29:39.720 --> 29:43.880
 We can contemplate things like longterm love

29:43.880 --> 29:46.080
 and we can have a longterm fear

29:46.080 --> 29:48.080
 of certain things like mortality.

29:48.080 --> 29:51.240
 We can contemplate whether the experiences,

29:51.240 --> 29:53.680
 the sort of the drugs of daily life

29:53.680 --> 29:57.280
 that we've been partaking in is making us happier,

29:57.280 --> 29:58.320
 better people.

29:58.320 --> 30:00.200
 And then once we contemplate that,

30:00.200 --> 30:03.800
 we can make financial decisions in using services

30:03.800 --> 30:06.880
 and paying for services that are making us better people.

30:06.880 --> 30:11.440
 So it just seems that we're in the very first stages

30:11.440 --> 30:15.520
 of social networks that just were able to make a lot of money

30:15.520 --> 30:20.080
 really quickly, but in bringing out sometimes

30:20.080 --> 30:23.200
 the bad parts of human nature, they didn't destroy humans.

30:23.200 --> 30:26.040
 They just fed everybody a lot of sugar.

30:26.040 --> 30:28.600
 And now everyone's gonna wake up and say,

30:28.600 --> 30:31.720
 hey, we're gonna start having like sugar free social media.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.280
 Right, right.

30:33.280 --> 30:34.800
 Well, there's a lot to unpack there.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.520
 I think some people certainly have the capacity for that.

30:37.520 --> 30:39.680
 And I certainly think, I mean, it's very interesting

30:39.680 --> 30:41.400
 even the way you said it, you woke up one day

30:41.400 --> 30:44.160
 and you thought, well, this doesn't feel very good.

30:44.160 --> 30:45.760
 Well, it's still your limbic system saying

30:45.760 --> 30:47.480
 this doesn't feel very good, right?

30:47.480 --> 30:50.040
 You have a cat brain's worth of neurons around your gut,

30:50.040 --> 30:50.880
 right?

30:50.880 --> 30:53.600
 And so maybe that saturated and that was telling you,

30:53.600 --> 30:55.000
 hey, this isn't good.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.320
 Humans are more than just mice looking for cheese

30:58.320 --> 31:00.800
 or monkeys looking for sex and power, right?

31:00.800 --> 31:01.640
 So.

31:01.640 --> 31:02.640
 Let's slow down.

31:02.640 --> 31:05.960
 Now a lot of people would argue with you on that one,

31:05.960 --> 31:06.800
 but yes.

31:06.800 --> 31:08.480
 Well, we're more than just that, but we're at least that.

31:08.480 --> 31:11.800
 And we're very, very seldom not that.

31:11.800 --> 31:15.080
 So I don't actually disagree with you

31:15.080 --> 31:18.240
 that we could be better and that better platforms exist.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.320
 And people are voluntarily noping out of things

31:20.320 --> 31:21.680
 like Facebook and noping out.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.760
 That's an awesome verb.

31:22.760 --> 31:23.680
 It's a great term.

31:23.680 --> 31:24.520
 Yeah, I love it.

31:24.520 --> 31:25.720
 I use it all the time.

31:25.720 --> 31:26.560
 You're welcome, Mike.

31:26.560 --> 31:27.400
 I'm gonna have to nope out of that.

31:27.400 --> 31:28.600
 I'm gonna have to nope out of that, right?

31:28.600 --> 31:32.840
 It's gonna be a hard pass and that's great.

31:32.840 --> 31:34.240
 But that's again, to your point,

31:34.240 --> 31:37.240
 that's the first generation of front facing cameras

31:37.240 --> 31:38.680
 of social pressures.

31:38.680 --> 31:43.560
 And you as a self starter, self aware adult

31:43.560 --> 31:46.360
 have the capacity to say, yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

31:46.360 --> 31:48.520
 I'm gonna go and spend time on long form reads.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.280
 I'm gonna spend time managing my attention.

31:50.280 --> 31:52.080
 I'm gonna do some yoga.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.960
 If you're a 15 year old in high school

31:54.960 --> 31:57.000
 and your entire social environment

31:57.000 --> 31:58.240
 is everyone doing these things,

31:58.240 --> 31:59.520
 guess what you're gonna do?

31:59.520 --> 32:00.680
 You're gonna kind of have to do that

32:00.680 --> 32:01.760
 because your limbic system says,

32:01.760 --> 32:04.520
 hey, I need to get the guy or the girl or the whatever.

32:04.520 --> 32:05.640
 And that's what I'm gonna do.

32:05.640 --> 32:07.800
 And so one of the things that we have to reason about here

32:07.800 --> 32:10.800
 is the social media systems or social media,

32:10.800 --> 32:15.800
 I think is our first encounter with a technological system

32:15.800 --> 32:20.800
 that runs a bit of a loop around our own cognition

32:20.800 --> 32:21.800
 and attention.

32:21.800 --> 32:25.600
 It's not the last, it's far from the last.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.280
 And it gets to the heart of some of the philosophical

32:28.280 --> 32:31.800
 Achilles heel of the Western philosophical system,

32:31.800 --> 32:34.280
 which is each person gets to make their own determination.

32:34.280 --> 32:37.280
 Each person is an individual that's sacrosanct

32:37.280 --> 32:39.960
 in their agency and their sovereignty and all these things.

32:39.960 --> 32:42.640
 The problem with these systems is they come down

32:42.640 --> 32:44.560
 and they are able to make their own decisions.

32:44.560 --> 32:48.080
 They come down and they are able to manage everyone on mass.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.240
 And so every person is making their own decision,

32:50.240 --> 32:53.720
 but together the bigger system is causing them to act

32:53.720 --> 32:58.720
 with a group dynamic that's very profitable for people.

32:58.760 --> 33:02.200
 So this is the issue that we have is that our philosophies

33:02.200 --> 33:05.080
 are actually not geared to understand

33:05.080 --> 33:10.080
 what is it for a person to have a high trust connection

33:10.400 --> 33:12.480
 as part of a collective and for that collective

33:12.480 --> 33:16.280
 to have its right to coherency and agency.

33:16.280 --> 33:19.400
 That's something like when a social media app

33:19.400 --> 33:21.720
 causes a family to break apart,

33:21.720 --> 33:24.640
 it's done harm to more than just individuals, right?

33:24.640 --> 33:27.320
 So that concept is not something we really talk about

33:27.320 --> 33:30.160
 or think about very much, but that's actually the problem

33:30.160 --> 33:33.200
 is that we're vaporizing molecules into atomic units

33:33.200 --> 33:35.160
 and then we're hitting all the atoms with certain things.

33:35.160 --> 33:38.360
 That's like, yeah, well, that person chose to look at my app.

33:38.360 --> 33:40.600
 So our understanding of human nature

33:40.600 --> 33:43.800
 at the individual level, it emphasizes the individual

33:43.800 --> 33:46.360
 too much because ultimately society operates

33:46.360 --> 33:47.440
 at the collective level.

33:47.440 --> 33:48.640
 And these apps do as well.

33:48.640 --> 33:49.880
 And the apps do as well.

33:49.880 --> 33:53.360
 So for us to understand the progression and the development

33:53.360 --> 33:56.000
 of this organism we call human civilization,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
 we have to think at the collective level too.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.280
 I would say multi tiered.

33:59.280 --> 34:00.240
 Multi tiered.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.600
 So individual as well.

34:01.600 --> 34:05.080
 Individuals, family units, social collectives

34:05.080 --> 34:06.400
 and all the way up.

34:06.400 --> 34:09.400
 Okay, so you've said that individual humans

34:09.400 --> 34:12.200
 are multi layered susceptible to signals and waves

34:12.200 --> 34:15.280
 and multiple strata, the physical, the biological,

34:15.280 --> 34:16.760
 social, cultural, intellectual.

34:16.760 --> 34:19.480
 So sort of going along these lines,

34:19.480 --> 34:22.880
 can you describe the layers of the cake

34:22.880 --> 34:27.360
 that is a human being and maybe the human collective,

34:27.360 --> 34:29.200
 human society?

34:29.200 --> 34:32.920
 So I'm just stealing wholesale here from Robert Persig,

34:32.920 --> 34:34.600
 who is the author of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle

34:34.600 --> 34:40.040
 Maintenance and his follow on book has a sequel to it

34:40.040 --> 34:40.720
 called Lila.

34:40.720 --> 34:42.440
 He goes into this in a little more detail.

34:42.440 --> 34:47.000
 But it's a crude approach to thinking about people.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.920
 But I think it's still an advancement

34:48.920 --> 34:51.200
 over traditional subject object metaphysics,

34:51.200 --> 34:53.960
 where we look at people as a dualist would say,

34:53.960 --> 34:57.200
 well, is your mind, your consciousness,

34:57.200 --> 35:01.120
 is that just merely the matter that's in your brain

35:01.120 --> 35:03.440
 or is there something kind of more beyond that?

35:03.440 --> 35:05.080
 And they would say, yes, there's a soul,

35:05.080 --> 35:09.280
 sort of ineffable soul beyond just merely the physical body.

35:09.280 --> 35:11.360
 And I'm not one of those people.

35:11.360 --> 35:15.560
 I think that we don't have to draw a line between are things

35:15.560 --> 35:16.840
 only this or only that.

35:16.840 --> 35:19.720
 Collectives of things can emerge structures and patterns

35:19.720 --> 35:22.000
 that are just as real as the underlying pieces.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.680
 But they're transcendent, but they're still

35:24.680 --> 35:26.520
 of the underlying pieces.

35:26.520 --> 35:28.400
 So your body is this way.

35:28.400 --> 35:31.000
 I mean, we just know physically you consist of atoms

35:31.000 --> 35:32.800
 and whatnot.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.680
 And then the atoms are arranged into molecules

35:34.680 --> 35:37.120
 which then arrange into certain kinds of structures

35:37.120 --> 35:39.560
 that seem to have a homeostasis to them.

35:39.560 --> 35:40.720
 We call them cells.

35:40.720 --> 35:44.560
 And those cells form sort of biological structures.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.840
 Those biological structures give your body

35:46.840 --> 35:49.000
 its physical ability and the biological ability

35:49.000 --> 35:51.800
 to consume energy and to maintain homeostasis.

35:51.800 --> 35:54.040
 But humans are social animals.

35:54.040 --> 35:57.320
 I mean, human by themselves is not very long for the world.

35:57.320 --> 36:02.200
 So part of our biology is why are two connect to other people?

36:02.200 --> 36:04.920
 From the mirror neurons to our language centers

36:04.920 --> 36:06.280
 and all these other things.

36:06.280 --> 36:09.160
 So we are intrinsically, there's a layer,

36:09.160 --> 36:12.560
 there's a part of us that wants to be part of a thing.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.640
 If we're around other people, not saying a word,

36:14.640 --> 36:17.140
 but they're just up and down jumping and dancing, laughing,

36:17.140 --> 36:18.580
 we're going to feel better.

36:18.580 --> 36:21.800
 And there was no exchange of physical anything.

36:21.800 --> 36:24.840
 They didn't give us like five atoms of happiness.

36:24.840 --> 36:27.520
 But there's an induction in our own sense of self

36:27.520 --> 36:29.600
 that is at that social level.

36:29.600 --> 36:33.560
 And then beyond that, Persick puts the intellectual level

36:33.560 --> 36:35.100
 kind of one level higher than social.

36:35.100 --> 36:37.220
 I think they're actually more intertwined than that.

36:37.220 --> 36:41.040
 But the intellectual level is the level of pure ideas.

36:41.040 --> 36:42.840
 That you are a vessel for memes.

36:42.840 --> 36:45.000
 You're a vessel for philosophies.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.400
 You will conduct yourself in a particular way.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.520
 I mean, I think part of this is if we think about it

36:49.520 --> 36:52.200
 from a physics perspective, you're not,

36:52.200 --> 36:55.080
 there's the joke that physicists like to approximate things.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.500
 And we'll say, well, approximate a spherical cow, right?

36:57.500 --> 36:59.640
 You're not a spherical cow, you're not a spherical human.

36:59.640 --> 37:00.760
 You're a messy human.

37:00.760 --> 37:04.000
 And we can't even say what the dynamics of your emotion

37:04.000 --> 37:08.560
 will be unless we analyze all four of these layers, right?

37:08.560 --> 37:11.760
 If you're Muslim at a certain time of day, guess what?

37:11.760 --> 37:14.000
 You're going to be on the ground kneeling and praying, right?

37:14.000 --> 37:15.960
 And that has nothing to do with your biological need

37:15.960 --> 37:18.520
 to get on the ground or physics of gravity.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.440
 It is an intellectual drive that you have.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.000
 It's a cultural phenomenon

37:22.000 --> 37:23.760
 and an intellectual belief that you carry.

37:23.760 --> 37:28.120
 So that's what the four layered stack is all about.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.360
 It's that a person is not only one of these things,

37:30.360 --> 37:31.760
 they're all of these things at the same time.

37:31.760 --> 37:35.680
 It's a superposition of dynamics that run through us

37:35.680 --> 37:37.360
 that make us who we are.

37:37.360 --> 37:39.540
 So no layer is special.

37:40.520 --> 37:41.720
 Not so much no layer is special,

37:41.720 --> 37:43.120
 each layer is just different.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.840
 But we are.

37:45.840 --> 37:48.320
 Each layer gets the participation trophy.

37:48.320 --> 37:50.320
 Yeah, each layer is a part of what you are.

37:50.320 --> 37:52.080
 You are a layer cake, right, of all these things.

37:52.080 --> 37:54.480
 And if we try to deny, right,

37:54.480 --> 37:56.580
 so many philosophies do try to deny

37:56.580 --> 37:58.960
 the reality of some of these things, right?

37:58.960 --> 38:01.420
 Some people will say, well, we're only atoms.

38:01.420 --> 38:02.480
 Well, we're not only atoms

38:02.480 --> 38:04.080
 because there's a lot of other things that are only atoms.

38:04.080 --> 38:07.000
 I can reduce a human being to a bunch of soup

38:07.000 --> 38:08.520
 and they're not the same thing,

38:08.520 --> 38:09.800
 even though it's the same atoms.

38:09.800 --> 38:12.160
 So I think the order and the patterns

38:12.160 --> 38:15.960
 that emerge within humans to understand,

38:15.960 --> 38:18.480
 to really think about what a next generation philosophy

38:18.480 --> 38:20.040
 would look like, that would allow us to reason

38:20.040 --> 38:22.960
 about extending humans into the digital realm

38:22.960 --> 38:25.560
 or to interact with autonomous intelligences

38:25.560 --> 38:27.520
 that are not biological in nature.

38:27.520 --> 38:29.640
 We really need to appreciate these,

38:29.640 --> 38:32.280
 that human, what human beings actually are

38:32.280 --> 38:34.760
 is the superposition of these different layers.

38:34.760 --> 38:36.640
 You mentioned consciousness.

38:36.640 --> 38:39.800
 Are each of these layers of cake conscious?

38:39.800 --> 38:43.760
 Is consciousness a particular quality of one of the layers?

38:43.760 --> 38:46.920
 Is there like a spike if you have a consciousness detector

38:46.920 --> 38:49.360
 at these layers or is something that just permeates

38:49.360 --> 38:51.920
 all of these layers and just takes different form?

38:51.920 --> 38:54.400
 I believe what humans experience as consciousness

38:54.400 --> 38:57.640
 is something that sits on a gradient scale

38:57.640 --> 39:00.540
 of a general principle in the universe

39:00.540 --> 39:04.960
 that seems to look for order and reach for order

39:04.960 --> 39:06.760
 when there's an excess of energy.

39:06.760 --> 39:09.400
 You know, it would be odd to say a proton is alive, right?

39:09.400 --> 39:12.040
 It'd be odd to say like this particular atom

39:12.040 --> 39:15.840
 or molecule of hydrogen gas is alive,

39:15.840 --> 39:20.680
 but there's certainly something we can make assemblages

39:20.680 --> 39:24.400
 of these things that have autopoetic aspects to them

39:24.400 --> 39:26.520
 that will create structures that will, you know,

39:26.520 --> 39:28.640
 crystalline solids will form very interesting

39:28.640 --> 39:29.960
 and beautiful structures.

39:29.960 --> 39:33.000
 This gets kind of into weird mathematical territories.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.320
 You start thinking about Penrose and Game of Life stuff

39:35.320 --> 39:37.900
 about the generativity of math itself,

39:37.900 --> 39:39.480
 like the hyperreal numbers, things like that.

39:39.480 --> 39:42.320
 But without going down that rabbit hole,

39:42.320 --> 39:45.540
 I would say that there seems to be a tendency

39:45.540 --> 39:49.120
 in the world that when there is excess energy,

39:49.120 --> 39:51.360
 things will structure and pattern themselves.

39:51.360 --> 39:53.760
 And they will then actually furthermore try to create

39:53.760 --> 39:58.040
 an environment that furthers their continued stability.

39:58.040 --> 40:00.800
 It's the concept of externalized extended phenotype

40:00.800 --> 40:02.240
 or niche construction.

40:02.240 --> 40:06.240
 So this is ultimately what leads to certain kinds

40:06.240 --> 40:09.180
 of amino acids forming certain kinds of structures

40:09.180 --> 40:11.120
 and so on and so forth until you get the ladder of life.

40:11.120 --> 40:12.880
 So what we experience as consciousness,

40:12.880 --> 40:15.560
 no, I don't think cells are conscious at that level,

40:15.560 --> 40:19.560
 but is there something beyond mere equilibrium state biology

40:19.560 --> 40:21.960
 and chemistry and biochemistry

40:21.960 --> 40:25.420
 that drives what makes things work?

40:25.420 --> 40:26.420
 I think there is.

40:27.620 --> 40:29.560
 So Adrian Bajan has his ConstructoLaw.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.200
 There's other things you can look at.

40:31.200 --> 40:32.440
 When you look at the life sciences

40:32.440 --> 40:36.040
 and you look at any kind of statistical physics

40:36.040 --> 40:37.440
 and statistical mechanics,

40:37.440 --> 40:40.540
 when you look at things far out of equilibrium,

40:40.540 --> 40:43.400
 when you have excess energy, what happens then?

40:43.400 --> 40:45.800
 Life doesn't just make a hotter soup.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.440
 It starts making structure.

40:47.440 --> 40:48.640
 There's something there.

40:48.640 --> 40:50.880
 The poetry of reaches for order

40:50.880 --> 40:52.860
 when there's an excess of energy.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.040
 Because you brought up game of life.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.160
 You did it, not me.

40:59.160 --> 41:00.360
 I love cellular automata,

41:00.360 --> 41:04.420
 so I have to sort of linger on that for a little bit.

41:06.400 --> 41:09.340
 So cellular automata, I guess, or game of life

41:09.340 --> 41:11.840
 is a very simple example of reaching for order

41:11.840 --> 41:14.080
 when there's an excess of energy.

41:14.080 --> 41:17.240
 Or reaching for order and somehow creating complexity.

41:17.240 --> 41:22.240
 Within this explosion of just turmoil,

41:22.440 --> 41:25.560
 somehow trying to construct structures.

41:25.560 --> 41:29.760
 And in so doing, create very elaborate

41:29.760 --> 41:31.560
 organism looking type things.

41:32.480 --> 41:35.840
 What intuition do you draw from this simple mechanism?

41:35.840 --> 41:37.840
 Well, I like to turn that around its head.

41:37.840 --> 41:42.400
 And look at it as what if every single one of the patterns

41:42.400 --> 41:45.800
 created life, or created, not life,

41:45.800 --> 41:47.400
 but created interesting patterns?

41:47.400 --> 41:48.640
 Because some of them don't.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.520
 And sometimes you make cool gliders.

41:50.520 --> 41:52.240
 And other times, you start with certain things

41:52.240 --> 41:54.020
 and you make gliders and other things

41:54.020 --> 41:57.040
 that then construct like AND gates and NOT gates, right?

41:57.040 --> 41:59.240
 And you build computers on them.

41:59.240 --> 42:00.800
 All of these rules that create these patterns

42:00.800 --> 42:04.640
 that we can see, those are just the patterns we can see.

42:04.640 --> 42:06.600
 What if our subjectivity is actually limiting

42:06.600 --> 42:09.720
 our ability to perceive the order in all of it?

42:11.000 --> 42:12.320
 What if some of the things that we think are random

42:12.320 --> 42:13.300
 are actually not that random?

42:13.300 --> 42:16.120
 We're simply not integrating at a final level

42:16.120 --> 42:17.980
 across a broad enough time horizon.

42:18.980 --> 42:20.600
 And this is again, I said, we go down the rabbit holes

42:20.600 --> 42:22.880
 and the Penrose stuff or like Wolfram's explorations

42:22.880 --> 42:23.720
 on these things.

42:24.960 --> 42:27.300
 There is something deep and beautiful

42:27.300 --> 42:28.600
 in the mathematics of all this.

42:28.600 --> 42:30.400
 That is hopefully one day I'll have enough money

42:30.400 --> 42:33.440
 to work and retire and just ponder those questions.

42:33.440 --> 42:34.560
 But there's something there.

42:34.560 --> 42:36.120
 But you're saying there's a ceiling to,

42:36.120 --> 42:38.480
 when you have enough money and you retire and you ponder,

42:38.480 --> 42:40.720
 there's a ceiling to how much you can truly ponder

42:40.720 --> 42:43.000
 because there's cognitive limitations

42:43.000 --> 42:46.320
 in what you're able to perceive as a pattern.

42:46.320 --> 42:47.160
 Yeah.

42:47.160 --> 42:51.520
 And maybe mathematics extends your perception capabilities,

42:51.520 --> 42:53.840
 but it's still finite.

42:53.840 --> 42:55.460
 It's just like.

42:55.460 --> 42:57.640
 Yeah, the mathematics we use is the mathematics

42:57.640 --> 42:59.000
 that can fit in our head.

42:59.000 --> 42:59.840
 Yeah.

43:00.840 --> 43:02.600
 Did God really create the integers?

43:02.600 --> 43:03.720
 Or did God create all of it?

43:03.720 --> 43:05.360
 And we just happen at this point in time

43:05.360 --> 43:07.240
 to be able to perceive integers.

43:07.240 --> 43:09.400
 Well, he just did the positive in it.

43:09.400 --> 43:11.360
 She, I just said, did she create all of it?

43:11.360 --> 43:12.200
 And then we.

43:14.200 --> 43:15.760
 She just created the natural numbers

43:15.760 --> 43:17.680
 and then we screwed it all up with zero and then I guess.

43:17.680 --> 43:18.560
 Okay.

43:18.560 --> 43:21.600
 But we did, we created mathematical operations

43:21.600 --> 43:23.700
 so that we can have iterated steps

43:23.700 --> 43:26.000
 to approach bigger problems, right?

43:26.000 --> 43:29.040
 I mean, the entire point of the Arabic Neural System

43:29.040 --> 43:32.600
 and it's a rubric for mapping a certain set of operations,

43:32.600 --> 43:35.360
 folding them into a simple little expression,

43:35.360 --> 43:38.740
 but that's just the operations that we can fit in our heads.

43:38.740 --> 43:41.140
 There are many other operations besides, right?

43:41.140 --> 43:46.020
 The thing that worries me the most about aliens and humans

43:46.020 --> 43:50.920
 is that the aliens are all around us and we're too dumb.

43:50.920 --> 43:51.760
 Yeah.

43:51.760 --> 43:52.580
 To see them.

43:52.580 --> 43:53.420
 Oh, certainly, yeah.

43:53.420 --> 43:54.800
 Or life, let's say just life,

43:54.800 --> 43:58.080
 life of all kinds of forms or organisms.

43:58.080 --> 44:01.940
 You know what, just even the intelligence of organisms

44:01.940 --> 44:04.160
 is imperceptible to us

44:04.160 --> 44:06.600
 because we're too dumb and self centered.

44:06.600 --> 44:07.440
 That worries me.

44:07.440 --> 44:09.560
 Well, we're looking for a particular kind of thing.

44:09.560 --> 44:10.400
 Yeah.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.220
 When I was at Cornell,

44:11.220 --> 44:13.860
 I had a lovely professor of Asian religions,

44:13.860 --> 44:14.700
 Jane Marie Law,

44:14.700 --> 44:17.760
 and she would tell this story about a musical,

44:17.760 --> 44:20.100
 a musician, a Western musician who went to Japan

44:20.100 --> 44:21.880
 and he taught classical music

44:21.880 --> 44:24.000
 and could play all sorts of instruments.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.480
 He went to Japan and he would ask people,

44:27.480 --> 44:30.640
 he would basically be looking for things in the style of

44:30.640 --> 44:34.080
 a Western chromatic scale and these kinds of things.

44:34.080 --> 44:35.380
 And then finding none of it,

44:35.380 --> 44:37.520
 he would say, well, there's really no music in Japan,

44:37.520 --> 44:38.800
 but they're using a different scale.

44:38.800 --> 44:40.440
 They're playing different kinds of instruments, right?

44:40.440 --> 44:42.620
 The same thing she was using as a sort of a metaphor

44:42.620 --> 44:43.660
 for religion as well.

44:43.660 --> 44:45.780
 In the West, we center a lot of religion,

44:45.780 --> 44:47.980
 certainly the religions of Abraham,

44:47.980 --> 44:50.040
 we center them around belief.

44:50.040 --> 44:52.440
 And in the East, it's more about practice, right?

44:52.440 --> 44:54.600
 Spirituality and practice rather than belief.

44:54.600 --> 44:57.360
 So anyway, the point is here to your point,

44:57.360 --> 45:00.820
 life, we, I think so many people are so fixated

45:00.820 --> 45:03.320
 on certain aspects of self replication

45:03.320 --> 45:06.120
 or homeostasis or whatever.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.840
 But if we kind of broaden and generalize this thing

45:08.840 --> 45:10.840
 of things reaching for order,

45:10.840 --> 45:13.540
 under which conditions can they then create an environment

45:13.540 --> 45:17.320
 that sustains that order, that allows them,

45:17.320 --> 45:20.120
 the invention of death is an interesting thing.

45:20.120 --> 45:21.480
 There are some organisms on earth

45:21.480 --> 45:23.380
 that are thousands of years old.

45:23.380 --> 45:25.520
 And it's not like they're incredibly complex,

45:25.520 --> 45:28.560
 they're actually simpler than the cells that comprise us,

45:28.560 --> 45:29.640
 but they never die.

45:29.640 --> 45:33.320
 So at some point, death was invented,

45:33.320 --> 45:34.720
 somewhere along the eukaryotic scale,

45:34.720 --> 45:35.980
 I mean, even the protists, right?

45:35.980 --> 45:37.180
 There's death.

45:37.180 --> 45:41.480
 And why is that along with the sexual reproduction, right?

45:41.480 --> 45:45.000
 There is something about the renewal process,

45:45.000 --> 45:46.520
 something about the ability to respond

45:46.520 --> 45:48.160
 to a changing environment,

45:48.160 --> 45:50.240
 where it just becomes,

45:50.240 --> 45:51.520
 just killing off the old generation

45:51.520 --> 45:54.240
 and letting new generations try,

45:54.240 --> 45:57.040
 seems to be the best way to fit into the niche.

45:57.040 --> 46:00.320
 Human historians seems to write about wheels and fires,

46:00.320 --> 46:01.640
 the greatest inventions,

46:01.640 --> 46:04.360
 but it seems like death and sex are pretty good.

46:04.360 --> 46:06.560
 And they're kind of essential inventions

46:06.560 --> 46:07.400
 at the very beginning.

46:07.400 --> 46:08.600
 At the very beginning, yeah.

46:08.600 --> 46:10.560
 Well, we didn't invent them, right?

46:10.560 --> 46:13.300
 Well, Broad, you didn't invent them.

46:13.300 --> 46:15.400
 I see us as one,

46:15.400 --> 46:17.880
 you particular Homo sapiens did not invent them,

46:17.880 --> 46:21.000
 but we together, it's a team project,

46:21.000 --> 46:21.880
 just like you're saying.

46:21.880 --> 46:24.280
 I think the greatest Homo sapiens invention

46:24.280 --> 46:25.640
 is collaboration.

46:25.640 --> 46:27.240
 So when you say collaboration,

46:29.640 --> 46:32.200
 Peter, where do ideas come from

46:32.200 --> 46:35.280
 and how do they take hold in society?

46:35.280 --> 46:36.960
 Is that the nature of collaboration?

46:36.960 --> 46:40.440
 Is that the basic atom of collaboration is ideas?

46:40.440 --> 46:43.200
 It's not not ideas, but it's not only ideas.

46:43.200 --> 46:44.440
 There's a book I just started reading

46:44.440 --> 46:45.920
 called Death From A Distance.

46:45.920 --> 46:46.740
 Have you heard of this?

46:46.740 --> 46:47.580
 No.

46:47.580 --> 46:49.200
 It's a really fascinating thesis,

46:49.200 --> 46:53.200
 which is that humans are the only conspecific,

46:53.200 --> 46:55.800
 the only species that can kill other members

46:55.800 --> 46:58.200
 of the species from range.

46:58.200 --> 46:59.600
 And maybe there's a few exceptions,

46:59.600 --> 47:01.020
 but if you look in the animal world,

47:01.020 --> 47:03.000
 you see like pronghorns butting heads, right?

47:03.000 --> 47:05.840
 You see the alpha lion and the beta lion

47:05.840 --> 47:07.200
 and they take each other down.

47:07.200 --> 47:08.720
 Humans, we developed the ability

47:08.720 --> 47:10.120
 to chuck rocks at each other,

47:10.120 --> 47:11.960
 well, at prey, but also at each other.

47:11.960 --> 47:14.920
 And that means the beta male can chunk a rock

47:14.920 --> 47:17.440
 at the alpha male and take them down.

47:17.440 --> 47:20.040
 And he can throw a lot of rocks actually,

47:20.040 --> 47:22.400
 miss a bunch of times, but just hit once and be good.

47:22.400 --> 47:25.800
 So this ability to actually kill members

47:25.800 --> 47:27.280
 of our own species from range

47:27.280 --> 47:29.960
 without a threat of harm to ourselves

47:29.960 --> 47:32.360
 created essentially mutually assured destruction

47:32.360 --> 47:34.000
 where we had to evolve cooperation.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.300
 If we didn't, then if we just continue to try to do,

47:37.300 --> 47:39.480
 like I'm the biggest monkey in the tribe

47:39.480 --> 47:43.040
 and I'm gonna own this tribe and you have to go,

47:43.040 --> 47:46.720
 if we do it that way, then those tribes basically failed.

47:46.720 --> 47:48.440
 And the tribes that persisted

47:48.440 --> 47:51.440
 and that have now given rise to the modern Homo sapiens

47:51.440 --> 47:53.860
 are the ones where respecting the fact

47:53.860 --> 47:56.240
 that we can kill each other from a range

47:56.240 --> 47:58.640
 without harm, like there's an asymmetric ability

47:58.640 --> 48:00.840
 to snipe the leader from range.

48:00.840 --> 48:03.920
 That meant that we sort of had to learn

48:03.920 --> 48:05.400
 how to cooperate with each other, right?

48:05.400 --> 48:06.600
 Come back here, don't throw that rock at me.

48:06.600 --> 48:07.960
 Let's talk our differences out.

48:07.960 --> 48:10.240
 So violence is also part of collaboration.

48:10.240 --> 48:12.320
 The threat of violence, let's say.

48:12.320 --> 48:15.720
 Well, the recognition, maybe the better way to put it

48:15.720 --> 48:17.480
 is the recognition that we have more to gain

48:17.480 --> 48:21.140
 by working together than the prisoner's dilemma

48:21.140 --> 48:22.580
 of both of us defecting.

48:23.520 --> 48:26.380
 So mutually assured destruction in all its forms

48:26.380 --> 48:28.720
 is part of this idea of collaboration.

48:28.720 --> 48:31.040
 Well, and Eric Weinstein talks about our nuclear peace,

48:31.040 --> 48:32.440
 right, I mean, it kind of sucks

48:32.440 --> 48:34.040
 with thousands of warheads aimed at each other,

48:34.040 --> 48:36.320
 we mean Russia and the US, but it's like,

48:36.320 --> 48:39.880
 on the other hand, we only fought proxy wars, right?

48:39.880 --> 48:41.360
 We did not have another World War III

48:41.360 --> 48:43.520
 of like hundreds of millions of people dying

48:43.520 --> 48:47.840
 to like machine gun fire and giant guided missiles.

48:47.840 --> 48:50.400
 So the original nuclear weapon is a rock

48:50.400 --> 48:52.280
 that we learned how to throw, essentially?

48:52.280 --> 48:54.280
 The original, yeah, well, the original scope of the world

48:54.280 --> 48:56.480
 for any human being was their little tribe.

48:58.740 --> 49:00.680
 I would say it still is for the most part.

49:00.680 --> 49:05.680
 Eric Weinstein speaks very highly of you,

49:05.800 --> 49:08.000
 which is very surprising to me at first

49:08.000 --> 49:10.800
 because I didn't know there's this depth to you

49:10.800 --> 49:15.560
 because I knew you as an amazing leader of engineers

49:15.560 --> 49:18.440
 and an engineer yourself and so on, so it's fascinating.

49:18.440 --> 49:23.440
 Maybe just as a comment, a side tangent that we can take,

49:23.800 --> 49:27.120
 what's your nature of your friendship with Eric Weinstein?

49:27.120 --> 49:30.620
 How did the two, how did such two interesting paths cross?

49:30.620 --> 49:32.960
 Is it your origins in physics?

49:32.960 --> 49:35.620
 Is it your interest in philosophy

49:35.620 --> 49:37.280
 and the ideas of how the world works?

49:37.280 --> 49:38.120
 What is it?

49:38.120 --> 49:40.920
 It's very random, Eric found me.

49:40.920 --> 49:43.840
 He actually found Travis and I.

49:43.840 --> 49:44.680
 Travis Oliphant.

49:44.680 --> 49:45.900
 Oliphant, yeah, we were both working

49:45.900 --> 49:48.520
 at a company called Enthought back in the mid 2000s

49:48.520 --> 49:50.840
 and we were doing a lot of consulting

49:50.840 --> 49:54.400
 around scientific Python and we'd made some tools

49:54.400 --> 49:57.400
 and Eric was trying to use some of these Python tools

49:57.400 --> 50:00.200
 to visualize, he had a fiber bundle approach

50:00.200 --> 50:03.440
 to modeling certain aspects of economics.

50:03.440 --> 50:05.200
 He was doing this and that's how he kind of got in touch

50:05.200 --> 50:06.160
 with us and so.

50:06.160 --> 50:08.160
 This was in the early.

50:08.160 --> 50:13.160
 This was mid 2000s, oh seven timeframe, oh six, oh seven.

50:13.680 --> 50:16.200
 Eric Weinstein trying to use Python.

50:16.200 --> 50:18.680
 Right, to visualize fiber bundles.

50:18.680 --> 50:20.160
 Using some of the tools that we had built

50:20.160 --> 50:21.280
 in the open source.

50:21.280 --> 50:24.160
 That's somehow entertaining to me, the thought of that.

50:24.160 --> 50:27.160
 It's very funny but then we met with him a couple times,

50:27.160 --> 50:28.780
 a really interesting guy and then in the wake

50:28.780 --> 50:31.360
 of the oh seven, oh eight kind of financial collapse,

50:31.360 --> 50:35.440
 he helped organize with Lee Smolin a symposium

50:35.440 --> 50:39.960
 at the Perimeter Institute about okay, well clearly,

50:39.960 --> 50:42.220
 big finance can't be trusted, government's in its pockets

50:42.220 --> 50:45.360
 with regulatory capture, what the F do we do?

50:45.360 --> 50:47.680
 And all sorts of people, Nassim Tlaib was there

50:47.680 --> 50:51.300
 and Andy Lowe from MIT was there and Bill Janeway,

50:51.300 --> 50:54.880
 I mean just a lot of top billing people were there

50:54.880 --> 50:58.480
 and he invited me and Travis and another one

50:58.480 --> 51:01.320
 of our coworkers, Robert Kern, who is anyone

51:01.320 --> 51:03.960
 in the SciPy, NumPy community knows Robert.

51:03.960 --> 51:04.780
 Really great guy.

51:04.780 --> 51:06.640
 So the three of us also got invited to go to this thing

51:06.640 --> 51:07.800
 and that's where I met Brett Weinstein

51:07.800 --> 51:09.520
 for the first time as well.

51:09.520 --> 51:11.680
 Yeah, I knew him before he got all famous

51:11.680 --> 51:13.440
 for unfortunate reasons, I guess.

51:13.440 --> 51:18.440
 But anyway, so we met then and kind of had a friendship

51:19.600 --> 51:21.400
 throughout since then.

51:21.400 --> 51:26.080
 You have a depth of thinking that kind of runs

51:26.080 --> 51:28.600
 with Eric in terms of just thinking about the world deeply

51:28.600 --> 51:31.720
 and thinking philosophically and then there's Eric's

51:31.720 --> 51:33.480
 interest in programming.

51:33.480 --> 51:38.080
 I actually have never, you know, he'll bring up programming

51:38.080 --> 51:41.100
 to me quite a bit as a metaphor for stuff.

51:41.100 --> 51:43.660
 But I never kind of pushed the point of like,

51:44.520 --> 51:46.820
 what's the nature of your interest in programming?

51:46.820 --> 51:48.840
 I think he saw it probably as a tool.

51:48.840 --> 51:49.680
 Yeah, absolutely.

51:49.680 --> 51:52.200
 That you visualize, to explore mathematics

51:52.200 --> 51:55.020
 and explore physics and I was wondering like,

51:55.020 --> 51:59.520
 what's his depth of interest and also his vision

51:59.520 --> 52:04.520
 for what programming would look like in the future.

52:05.640 --> 52:08.000
 Have you had interaction with him, like discussion

52:08.000 --> 52:09.840
 in the space of Python, programming?

52:09.840 --> 52:11.920
 Well, in the sense of sometimes he asks me,

52:11.920 --> 52:13.620
 why is this stuff still so hard?

52:13.620 --> 52:18.280
 Yeah, you know, everybody's a critic.

52:18.280 --> 52:20.320
 But actually, no, Eric.

52:20.320 --> 52:21.440
 Programming, you mean, like in general?

52:21.440 --> 52:23.320
 Yes, yes, well, not programming in general,

52:23.320 --> 52:25.560
 but certain things in the Python ecosystem.

52:25.560 --> 52:29.560
 But he actually, I think what I find in listening

52:29.560 --> 52:31.640
 to some of his stuff is that he does use

52:31.640 --> 52:33.280
 programming metaphors a lot, right?

52:33.280 --> 52:35.420
 He'll talk about APIs or object oriented

52:35.420 --> 52:36.400
 and things like that.

52:36.400 --> 52:39.240
 So I think that's a useful set of frames

52:39.240 --> 52:42.880
 for him to draw upon for discourse.

52:42.880 --> 52:45.440
 I haven't pair programmed with him in a very long time.

52:45.440 --> 52:47.240
 You've previously pair coded with Eric.

52:47.240 --> 52:49.520
 Well, I mean, I look at his code trying to help

52:49.520 --> 52:50.960
 like put together some of the visualizations

52:50.960 --> 52:51.800
 around these things.

52:51.800 --> 52:54.040
 But it's been a very, not really pair programmed,

52:54.040 --> 52:55.800
 but like even looked at his code, right?

52:55.800 --> 52:56.640
 I mean.

52:56.640 --> 52:59.920
 How legendary would be is that like Git repo

53:01.040 --> 53:02.680
 with Peter Wang and Eric Weinstein?

53:02.680 --> 53:05.480
 Well, honestly, Robert Kern did all the heavy lifting.

53:05.480 --> 53:06.880
 So I have to give credit where credit is due.

53:06.880 --> 53:10.760
 Robert is the silent but incredibly deep, quiet,

53:10.760 --> 53:13.480
 not silent, but quiet, but incredibly deep individual

53:13.480 --> 53:14.720
 at the heart of a lot of those things

53:14.720 --> 53:16.720
 that Eric was trying to do.

53:16.720 --> 53:19.160
 But we did have, you know, as Travis and I

53:19.160 --> 53:23.520
 were starting our company in 2012 timeframe,

53:23.520 --> 53:24.640
 we went to New York.

53:24.640 --> 53:26.120
 Eric was still in New York at the time.

53:26.120 --> 53:29.160
 He hadn't moved to, this is before he joined Teal Capital.

53:29.160 --> 53:31.560
 We just had like a steak dinner somewhere.

53:31.560 --> 53:33.400
 Maybe it was Keynes, I don't know, somewhere in New York.

53:33.400 --> 53:36.360
 So it was me, Travis, Eric, and then Wes McKinney,

53:36.360 --> 53:39.520
 the creative pandas, and then Wes's then business partner,

53:39.520 --> 53:42.040
 Adam, the five of us sat around having this,

53:42.040 --> 53:45.520
 just a hilarious time, amazing dinner.

53:45.520 --> 53:46.960
 I forget what all we talked about,

53:46.960 --> 53:49.000
 but it was one of those conversations,

53:49.000 --> 53:51.400
 which I wish as soon as COVID is over,

53:51.400 --> 53:53.080
 maybe Eric and I can sit down.

53:53.080 --> 53:53.920
 Recreate.

53:53.920 --> 53:56.720
 Recreate it somewhere in LA, or maybe he comes here,

53:56.720 --> 53:58.160
 because a lot of cool people are here in Austin, right?

53:58.160 --> 53:59.000
 Exactly.

53:59.000 --> 53:59.840
 Yeah, we're all here.

53:59.840 --> 54:00.680
 He should come here.

54:00.680 --> 54:01.520
 Come here.

54:01.520 --> 54:02.360
 Yeah.

54:02.360 --> 54:04.120
 So he uses the metaphor source code sometimes

54:04.120 --> 54:05.320
 to talk about physics.

54:05.320 --> 54:07.160
 We figure out our own source code.

54:07.160 --> 54:09.240
 So you with a physics background

54:10.880 --> 54:14.160
 and somebody who's quite a bit of an expert in source code,

54:14.160 --> 54:16.880
 do you think we'll ever figure out our own source code

54:17.760 --> 54:19.040
 in the way that Eric means?

54:19.040 --> 54:20.360
 Do you think we'll figure out the nature of reality?

54:20.360 --> 54:21.760
 Well, I think we're constantly working on that problem.

54:21.760 --> 54:24.400
 I mean, I think we'll make more and more progress.

54:24.400 --> 54:28.120
 For me, there's some things I don't really doubt too much.

54:28.120 --> 54:29.960
 Like, I don't really doubt that one day

54:29.960 --> 54:34.480
 we will create a synthetic, maybe not fully in silicon,

54:34.480 --> 54:37.080
 but a synthetic approach to

54:39.240 --> 54:42.680
 cognition that rivals the biological

54:42.680 --> 54:44.760
 20 watt computers in our heads.

54:44.760 --> 54:46.080
 What's cognition here?

54:46.080 --> 54:46.920
 Cognition.

54:46.920 --> 54:47.760
 Which aspect?

54:47.760 --> 54:49.960
 Perception, attention, memory, recall,

54:49.960 --> 54:51.840
 asking better questions.

54:51.840 --> 54:53.200
 That for me is a measure of intelligence.

54:53.200 --> 54:55.400
 Doesn't Roomba vacuum cleaner already do that?

54:55.400 --> 54:57.080
 Or do you mean, oh, it doesn't ask questions.

54:57.080 --> 55:00.160
 I mean, no, it's, I mean, I have a Roomba,

55:00.160 --> 55:03.080
 but it's not even as smart as my cat, right?

55:03.080 --> 55:05.320
 Yeah, but it asks questions about what is this wall?

55:05.320 --> 55:08.920
 It now, new feature asks, is this poop or not, apparently.

55:08.920 --> 55:11.320
 Yes, a lot of our current cybernetic system,

55:11.320 --> 55:12.640
 it's a cybernetic system.

55:12.640 --> 55:14.960
 It will go and it will happily vacuum up some poop, right?

55:14.960 --> 55:16.640
 The older generations would.

55:16.640 --> 55:19.400
 The new one, just released, does not vacuum up the poop.

55:19.400 --> 55:20.240
 Okay.

55:20.240 --> 55:21.080
 This is a commercial for.

55:21.080 --> 55:21.920
 I wonder if it still gets stuck

55:21.920 --> 55:23.800
 under my first rung of my stair.

55:23.800 --> 55:27.160
 In any case, these cybernetic systems we have,

55:27.160 --> 55:32.080
 they are mold, they're designed to be sent off

55:32.080 --> 55:34.040
 into a relatively static environment.

55:34.040 --> 55:36.400
 And whatever dynamic things happen in the environment,

55:36.400 --> 55:38.920
 they have a very limited capacity to respond to.

55:38.920 --> 55:43.080
 A human baby, a human toddler of 18 months of age

55:43.080 --> 55:45.840
 has more capacity to manage its own attention

55:45.840 --> 55:49.200
 and its own capacity to make better sense of the world

55:49.200 --> 55:51.720
 than the most advanced robots today.

55:51.720 --> 55:55.160
 So again, my cat, I think can do a better job of my two

55:55.160 --> 55:56.400
 and they're both pretty clever.

55:56.400 --> 55:59.440
 So I do think though, back to my kind of original point,

55:59.440 --> 56:02.720
 I think that it's not, for me, it's not question at all

56:02.720 --> 56:05.960
 that we will be able to create synthetic systems

56:05.960 --> 56:09.200
 that are able to do this better than the human,

56:09.200 --> 56:11.720
 at an equal level or better than the human mind.

56:11.720 --> 56:16.400
 It's also for me, not a question that we will be able

56:16.400 --> 56:20.160
 to put them alongside humans

56:20.160 --> 56:23.240
 so that they capture the full broad spectrum

56:23.240 --> 56:25.400
 of what we are seeing as well.

56:25.400 --> 56:28.040
 And also looking at our responses,

56:28.040 --> 56:28.920
 listening to our responses,

56:28.920 --> 56:32.040
 even maybe measuring certain vital signs about us.

56:32.040 --> 56:34.440
 So in this kind of sidecar mode,

56:34.440 --> 56:37.600
 a greater intelligence could use us

56:37.600 --> 56:42.080
 and our whatever 80 years of life to train itself up

56:42.080 --> 56:45.080
 and then be a very good simulacrum of us moving forward.

56:45.080 --> 56:48.120
 So who is in the sidecar

56:48.120 --> 56:50.440
 in that picture of the future exactly?

56:50.440 --> 56:52.960
 The baby version of our immortal selves.

56:52.960 --> 56:56.160
 Okay, so once the baby grows up,

56:56.160 --> 56:58.440
 is there any use for humans?

56:58.440 --> 56:59.960
 I think so.

56:59.960 --> 57:03.240
 I think that out of epistemic humility,

57:03.240 --> 57:05.600
 we need to keep humans around for a long time.

57:05.600 --> 57:07.960
 And I would hope that anyone making those systems

57:07.960 --> 57:10.040
 would believe that to be true.

57:10.040 --> 57:11.640
 Out of epistemic humility,

57:11.640 --> 57:13.480
 what's the nature of the humility that?

57:13.480 --> 57:15.400
 That we don't know what we don't know.

57:16.440 --> 57:17.280
 So we don't.

57:18.960 --> 57:19.800
 Right?

57:19.800 --> 57:20.640
 So we don't know.

57:20.640 --> 57:21.680
 First we have to build systems

57:21.680 --> 57:24.400
 that help us do the things that we do know about

57:24.400 --> 57:26.760
 that can then probe the unknowns that we know about.

57:26.760 --> 57:28.560
 But the unknown unknowns, we don't know.

57:28.560 --> 57:30.040
 We could always know.

57:30.040 --> 57:31.160
 Nature is the one thing

57:31.160 --> 57:33.800
 that is infinitely able to surprise us.

57:33.800 --> 57:35.880
 So we should keep biological humans around

57:35.880 --> 57:37.600
 for a very, very, very long time.

57:37.600 --> 57:40.440
 Even after our immortal selves have transcended

57:40.440 --> 57:42.880
 and have gone off to explore other worlds,

57:42.880 --> 57:45.200
 gone to go communicate with the lifeforms living in the sun

57:45.200 --> 57:46.040
 or whatever else.

57:46.040 --> 57:49.200
 So I think that's,

57:49.200 --> 57:53.000
 for me, these seem like things that are going to happen.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.480
 Like I don't really question that,

57:54.480 --> 57:55.720
 that they're gonna happen.

57:55.720 --> 57:58.240
 Assuming we don't completely destroy ourselves.

57:58.240 --> 58:02.480
 Is it possible to create an AI system

58:02.480 --> 58:06.160
 that you fall in love with and it falls in love with you

58:06.160 --> 58:08.480
 and you have a romantic relationship with it?

58:08.480 --> 58:10.760
 Or a deep friendship, let's say.

58:10.760 --> 58:12.680
 I would hope that that is the design criteria

58:12.680 --> 58:14.520
 for any of these systems.

58:14.520 --> 58:18.480
 If we cannot have a meaningful relationship with it,

58:18.480 --> 58:20.320
 then it's still just a chunk of silicon.

58:20.320 --> 58:21.680
 So then what is meaningful?

58:21.680 --> 58:23.800
 Because back to sugar.

58:23.800 --> 58:25.400
 Well, sugar doesn't love you back, right?

58:25.400 --> 58:26.840
 So the computer has to love you back.

58:26.840 --> 58:28.200
 And what does love mean?

58:28.200 --> 58:30.160
 Well, in this context, for me, love,

58:30.160 --> 58:32.040
 I'm gonna take a page from Alain de Botton.

58:32.040 --> 58:34.400
 Love means that it wants to help us

58:34.400 --> 58:36.640
 become the best version of ourselves.

58:36.640 --> 58:39.440
 Yes, that's beautiful.

58:39.440 --> 58:40.760
 That's a beautiful definition of love.

58:40.760 --> 58:45.360
 So what role does love play in the human condition

58:45.360 --> 58:48.720
 at the individual level and at the group level?

58:48.720 --> 58:51.120
 Because you were kind of saying that humans,

58:51.120 --> 58:52.280
 we should really consider humans

58:52.280 --> 58:55.320
 both at the individual and the group and the societal level.

58:55.320 --> 58:56.960
 What's the role of love in this whole thing?

58:56.960 --> 58:59.640
 We talked about sex, we talked about death,

58:59.640 --> 59:02.320
 thanks to the bacteria that invented it.

59:02.320 --> 59:04.320
 At which point did we invent love, by the way?

59:04.320 --> 59:05.560
 I mean, is that also?

59:05.560 --> 59:08.960
 No, I think love is the start of it all.

59:08.960 --> 59:13.080
 And the feelings of, and this gets sort of beyond

59:13.080 --> 59:16.760
 just romantic, sensual, whatever kind of things,

59:16.760 --> 59:19.720
 but actually genuine love as we have for another person.

59:19.720 --> 59:22.680
 Love as it would be used in a religious text, right?

59:22.680 --> 59:25.480
 I think that capacity to feel love

59:25.480 --> 59:28.440
 more than consciousness, that is the universal thing.

59:28.440 --> 59:30.320
 Our feeling of love is actually a sense

59:30.320 --> 59:31.320
 of that generativity.

59:31.320 --> 59:33.120
 When we can look at another person

59:33.120 --> 59:37.440
 and see that they can be something more than they are,

59:37.440 --> 59:42.440
 and more than just a pigeonhole we might stick them in.

59:42.480 --> 59:44.160
 I mean, I think there's, in any religious text,

59:44.160 --> 59:47.640
 you'll find voiced some concept of this,

59:47.640 --> 59:50.920
 that you should see the grace of God in the other person.

59:50.920 --> 59:54.760
 They're made in the spirit of the love

59:54.760 --> 59:57.120
 that God feels for his creation or her creation.

59:57.120 --> 1:00:00.180
 And so I think this thing is actually the root of it.

1:00:00.180 --> 1:00:04.800
 So I would say, I don't think molecules of water

1:00:04.800 --> 1:00:06.280
 feel consciousness, have consciousness,

1:00:06.280 --> 1:00:10.920
 but there is some proto micro quantum thing of love.

1:00:10.920 --> 1:00:14.080
 That's the generativity when there's more energy

1:00:14.080 --> 1:00:16.280
 than what they need to maintain equilibrium.

1:00:16.280 --> 1:00:19.800
 And that when you sum it all up is something that leads to,

1:00:19.800 --> 1:00:23.500
 I mean, I had my mind blown one day as an undergrad

1:00:23.500 --> 1:00:24.560
 at the physics computer lab.

1:00:24.560 --> 1:00:28.300
 I logged in and when you log into bash for a long time,

1:00:28.300 --> 1:00:29.600
 there was a little fortune that would come out.

1:00:29.600 --> 1:00:32.400
 And it said, man was created by water

1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:33.940
 to carry itself uphill.

1:00:33.940 --> 1:00:37.960
 And I was logging into work on some problem set

1:00:37.960 --> 1:00:40.540
 and I logged in and I saw that and I just said,

1:00:40.540 --> 1:00:43.120
 son of a bitch, I just, I logged out

1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:45.080
 and I went to the coffee shop and I got a coffee

1:00:45.080 --> 1:00:47.040
 and I sat there on the quad and I'm like,

1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:52.040
 you know, it's not wrong and yet WTF, right?

1:00:53.440 --> 1:00:55.320
 So when you look at it that way,

1:00:55.320 --> 1:00:59.040
 it's like, yeah, okay, non equilibrium physics is a thing.

1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:00.960
 And so when we think about love,

1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:05.360
 when we think about these kinds of things, I would say

1:01:05.360 --> 1:01:08.160
 that in the modern day human condition,

1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:12.300
 there's a lot of talk about freedom and individual liberty

1:01:12.300 --> 1:01:14.600
 and rights and all these things,

1:01:14.600 --> 1:01:18.120
 but that's very Hegelian, it's very kind of following

1:01:18.120 --> 1:01:22.760
 from the Western philosophy of the individual as sacrosanct,

1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:26.360
 but it's not really couched I think the right way

1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:29.460
 because it should be how do we maximize people's ability

1:01:29.460 --> 1:01:32.100
 to love each other, to love themselves first,

1:01:32.100 --> 1:01:34.560
 to love each other, their responsibilities

1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:37.800
 to the previous generation, to the future generations.

1:01:37.800 --> 1:01:39.280
 Those are the kinds of things

1:01:39.280 --> 1:01:41.840
 that should be our design criteria, right?

1:01:41.840 --> 1:01:45.720
 Those should be what we start with to then come up

1:01:45.720 --> 1:01:48.280
 with the philosophies of self and of rights

1:01:48.280 --> 1:01:52.080
 and responsibilities, but that love being at the center

1:01:52.080 --> 1:01:55.720
 of it, I think when we design systems for cognition,

1:01:56.680 --> 1:01:58.700
 it should absolutely be built that way.

1:01:58.700 --> 1:02:02.240
 I think if we simply focus on efficiency and productivity,

1:02:02.240 --> 1:02:04.900
 these kind of very industrial era,

1:02:05.900 --> 1:02:08.200
 all the things that Marx had issues with, right?

1:02:08.200 --> 1:02:11.880
 Those, that's a way to go and really I think go off

1:02:11.880 --> 1:02:13.600
 the deep end in the wrong way.

1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:18.600
 So one of the interesting consequences of thinking of life

1:02:19.200 --> 1:02:22.440
 in this hierarchical way of an individual human

1:02:22.440 --> 1:02:25.040
 and then there's groups and there's societies

1:02:25.040 --> 1:02:30.040
 is I believe that you believe that corporations are people.

1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:36.600
 So this is a kind of a politically dense idea,

1:02:36.600 --> 1:02:37.440
 all those kinds of things.

1:02:37.440 --> 1:02:39.100
 If we just throw politics aside,

1:02:39.100 --> 1:02:41.300
 if we throw all of that aside,

1:02:41.300 --> 1:02:44.640
 in which sense do you believe that corporations are people?

1:02:46.260 --> 1:02:47.760
 And how does love connect to that?

1:02:47.760 --> 1:02:52.040
 Right, so the belief is that groups of people

1:02:52.040 --> 1:02:55.680
 have some kind of higher level, I would say mesoscopic

1:02:55.680 --> 1:02:56.680
 claim to agency.

1:02:57.960 --> 1:03:00.920
 So where do I, let's start with this.

1:03:00.920 --> 1:03:03.720
 Most people would say, okay, individuals have claims

1:03:03.720 --> 1:03:05.140
 to agency and sovereignty.

1:03:05.140 --> 1:03:07.640
 Nations, we certainly act as if nations,

1:03:07.640 --> 1:03:09.520
 so at a very large, large scale,

1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:13.120
 nations have rights to sovereignty and agency.

1:03:13.120 --> 1:03:15.000
 Like everyone plays the game of modernity

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:16.320
 as if that's true, right?

1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:17.380
 We believe France is a thing,

1:03:17.380 --> 1:03:18.800
 we believe the United States is a thing.

1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:23.100
 But to say that groups of people at a smaller level

1:03:23.100 --> 1:03:26.640
 than that, like a family unit is the thing.

1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:30.440
 Well, in our laws, we actually do encode this concept.

1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:33.800
 I believe that in a relationship and a marriage, right,

1:03:33.800 --> 1:03:37.720
 one partner can sue for loss of consortium, right?

1:03:37.720 --> 1:03:39.820
 If someone breaks up the marriage or whatever.

1:03:39.820 --> 1:03:41.560
 So these are concepts that even in law,

1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:44.720
 we do respect that there is something about the union

1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:45.980
 and about the family.

1:03:45.980 --> 1:03:48.640
 So for me, I don't think it's so weird to think

1:03:48.640 --> 1:03:51.820
 that groups of people have a right to,

1:03:51.820 --> 1:03:54.640
 a claim to rights and sovereignty of some degree.

1:03:54.640 --> 1:03:59.040
 I mean, we look at our clubs, we look at churches.

1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:02.000
 These are, we talk about these collectives of people

1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:05.800
 as if they have a real agency to them, and they do.

1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:08.720
 But I think if we take that one step further and say,

1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:10.320
 okay, they can accrue resources.

1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:12.720
 Well, yes, check, you know, and by law they can.

1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:17.060
 They can own land, they can engage in contracts,

1:04:17.060 --> 1:04:18.840
 they can do all these different kinds of things.

1:04:18.840 --> 1:04:22.600
 So we in legal terms support this idea

1:04:22.600 --> 1:04:24.680
 that groups of people have rights.

1:04:26.200 --> 1:04:28.040
 Where we go wrong on this stuff

1:04:28.040 --> 1:04:31.280
 is that the most popular version of this

1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:35.360
 is the for profit absentee owner corporation

1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:38.440
 that then is able to amass larger resources

1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:40.840
 than anyone else in the landscape, anything else,

1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:42.760
 any other entity of equivalent size.

1:04:42.760 --> 1:04:45.480
 And they're able to essentially bully around individuals,

1:04:45.480 --> 1:04:47.040
 whether it's laborers, whether it's people

1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:48.960
 whose resources they want to capture.

1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:50.480
 They're also able to bully around

1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:52.160
 our system of representation,

1:04:52.160 --> 1:04:55.540
 which is still tied to individuals, right?

1:04:55.540 --> 1:04:58.520
 So I don't believe that's correct.

1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:01.160
 I don't think it's good that they, you know,

1:05:01.160 --> 1:05:02.320
 they're people, but they're assholes.

1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:03.680
 I don't think that corporations as people

1:05:03.680 --> 1:05:05.520
 acting like assholes is a good thing.

1:05:05.520 --> 1:05:08.440
 But the idea that collectives and collections of people

1:05:08.440 --> 1:05:10.120
 that we should treat them philosophically

1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:15.120
 as having some agency and some mass,

1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:18.000
 at a mesoscopic level, I think that's an important thing

1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:22.400
 because one thing I do think we underappreciate sometimes

1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:26.200
 is the fact that relationships have relationships.

1:05:26.200 --> 1:05:27.240
 So it's not just individuals

1:05:27.240 --> 1:05:29.120
 having relationships with each other.

1:05:29.120 --> 1:05:32.080
 But if you have eight people seated around a table, right?

1:05:32.080 --> 1:05:34.200
 Each person has a relationship with each of the others

1:05:34.200 --> 1:05:35.640
 and that's obvious.

1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:37.880
 But then if it's four couples,

1:05:37.880 --> 1:05:39.720
 each couple also has a relationship

1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:41.720
 with each of the other couples, right?

1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:42.720
 The dyads do.

1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:45.600
 And if it's couples, but one is the, you know,

1:05:45.600 --> 1:05:48.200
 father and mother older, and then, you know,

1:05:48.200 --> 1:05:50.960
 one of their children and their spouse,

1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:53.980
 that family unit of four has a relationship

1:05:53.980 --> 1:05:55.760
 with the other family unit of four.

1:05:55.760 --> 1:05:57.640
 So the idea that relationships have relationships

1:05:57.640 --> 1:05:59.920
 is something that we intuitively know

1:05:59.920 --> 1:06:01.780
 in navigating the social landscape,

1:06:01.780 --> 1:06:04.720
 but it's not something I hear expressed like that.

1:06:04.720 --> 1:06:06.680
 It's certainly not something that is,

1:06:06.680 --> 1:06:08.160
 I think, taken into account very well

1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:09.480
 when we design these kinds of things.

1:06:09.480 --> 1:06:14.080
 So I think the reason why I care a lot about this

1:06:14.080 --> 1:06:16.520
 is because I think the future of humanity

1:06:16.520 --> 1:06:19.660
 requires us to form better sense make,

1:06:19.660 --> 1:06:23.680
 collective sense making units at something, you know,

1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:28.160
 around Dunbar number, you know, half to five X Dunbar.

1:06:28.160 --> 1:06:30.640
 And that's very different than right now

1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:33.600
 where we defer sense making

1:06:33.600 --> 1:06:37.040
 to massive aging zombie institutions.

1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:38.520
 Or we just do it ourselves.

1:06:38.520 --> 1:06:39.360
 Go it alone.

1:06:39.360 --> 1:06:41.120
 Go to the dark force of the internet by ourselves.

1:06:41.120 --> 1:06:42.360
 So that's really interesting.

1:06:42.360 --> 1:06:45.340
 So you've talked about agency,

1:06:45.340 --> 1:06:47.760
 I think maybe calling it a convenient fiction

1:06:47.760 --> 1:06:49.620
 at all these different levels.

1:06:49.620 --> 1:06:52.080
 So even at the human individual level,

1:06:52.080 --> 1:06:53.160
 it's kind of a fiction.

1:06:53.160 --> 1:06:55.080
 We all believe, because we are, like you said,

1:06:55.080 --> 1:06:57.720
 made of cells and cells are made of atoms.

1:06:57.720 --> 1:06:58.980
 So that's a useful fiction.

1:06:58.980 --> 1:07:02.900
 And then there's nations that seems to be a useful fiction,

1:07:02.900 --> 1:07:06.900
 but it seems like some fictions are better than others.

1:07:06.900 --> 1:07:08.400
 You know, there's a lot of people that argue

1:07:08.400 --> 1:07:11.000
 the fiction of nation is a bad idea.

1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.880
 One of them lives two doors down from me,

1:07:13.880 --> 1:07:16.160
 Michael Malice, he's an anarchist.

1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:18.280
 You know, I'm sure there's a lot of people

1:07:18.280 --> 1:07:21.860
 who are into meditation that believe the idea,

1:07:21.860 --> 1:07:24.920
 this useful fiction of agency of an individual

1:07:24.920 --> 1:07:26.680
 is a troublesome as well.

1:07:26.680 --> 1:07:29.460
 We need to let go of that in order to truly,

1:07:29.460 --> 1:07:32.320
 like to transcend, I don't know.

1:07:32.320 --> 1:07:33.760
 I don't know what words you want to use,

1:07:33.760 --> 1:07:38.440
 but suffering or to elevate the experience of life.

1:07:38.440 --> 1:07:40.800
 So you're kind of arguing that,

1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:44.680
 okay, so we have some of these useful fictions of agency.

1:07:44.680 --> 1:07:49.000
 We should add a stronger fiction that we tell ourselves

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.700
 about the agency of groups in the hundreds

1:07:52.700 --> 1:07:57.700
 of the half a Dunbar's number, 5X Dunbar's number.

1:07:57.920 --> 1:07:58.760
 Yeah, something on that order.

1:07:58.760 --> 1:07:59.800
 And we call them fictions,

1:07:59.800 --> 1:08:01.580
 but really they're rules of the game, right?

1:08:01.580 --> 1:08:05.720
 Rules that we feel are fair or rules that we consent to.

1:08:05.720 --> 1:08:07.000
 Yeah, I always question the rules

1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:08.600
 when I lose like a monopoly.

1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:09.840
 That's when I usually question the rules.

1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:11.600
 When I'm winning, I don't question the rules.

1:08:11.600 --> 1:08:12.880
 We should play a game Monopoly someday.

1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:15.240
 There's a trippy version of it that we could do.

1:08:15.240 --> 1:08:16.320
 What kind?

1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:19.200
 Contract Monopoly is introduced by a friend of mine to me

1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:23.120
 where you can write contracts on future earnings

1:08:23.120 --> 1:08:24.600
 or landing on various things.

1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:26.720
 And you can hand out like, you know,

1:08:26.720 --> 1:08:28.080
 you can land the first three times you land

1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:30.160
 in a park place, it's free or whatever.

1:08:30.160 --> 1:08:33.480
 And then you can start trading those contracts for money.

1:08:33.480 --> 1:08:35.440
 And then you create a human civilization

1:08:36.760 --> 1:08:38.280
 and somehow Bitcoin comes into it.

1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:40.520
 Okay, but some of these.

1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:43.040
 Actually, I bet if me and you and Eric sat down

1:08:43.040 --> 1:08:45.320
 to play a game Monopoly and we were to make NFTs

1:08:45.320 --> 1:08:48.000
 out of the contracts we wrote, we could make a lot of money.

1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:49.320
 Now it's a terrible idea.

1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:50.200
 I would never do it,

1:08:50.200 --> 1:08:52.920
 but I bet we could actually sell the NFTs around.

1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:56.800
 I have other ideas to make money that I could tell you

1:08:56.800 --> 1:08:58.400
 and they're all terrible ideas.

1:08:58.400 --> 1:09:02.280
 Yeah, including cat videos on the internet.

1:09:02.280 --> 1:09:04.600
 Okay, but some of these rules of the game,

1:09:04.600 --> 1:09:06.040
 some of these fictions are,

1:09:06.040 --> 1:09:09.280
 it seems like they're better than others.

1:09:09.280 --> 1:09:13.320
 They have worked this far to cohere human,

1:09:13.320 --> 1:09:14.840
 to organize human collective action.

1:09:14.840 --> 1:09:16.600
 But you're saying something about,

1:09:16.600 --> 1:09:19.240
 especially this technological age

1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:23.640
 requires modified fictions, stories of agency.

1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:25.040
 Why the Dunbar number?

1:09:25.040 --> 1:09:28.240
 And also, you know, how do you select the group of people?

1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:31.760
 You know, Dunbar numbers, I think I have the sense

1:09:31.760 --> 1:09:36.360
 that it's overused as a kind of law

1:09:36.360 --> 1:09:41.280
 that somehow we can have deep human connection at this scale.

1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:45.440
 Like some of it feels like an interface problem too.

1:09:45.440 --> 1:09:48.080
 It feels like if I have the right tools,

1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:51.840
 I can deeply connect with a larger number of people.

1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:55.480
 It just feels like there's a huge value

1:09:55.480 --> 1:09:59.400
 to interacting just in person, getting to share

1:09:59.400 --> 1:10:00.960
 traumatic experiences together,

1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:02.720
 beautiful experiences together.

1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:06.920
 There's other experiences like that in the digital space

1:10:06.920 --> 1:10:07.760
 that you can share.

1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:09.360
 It just feels like Dunbar's number

1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:10.800
 could be expanded significantly,

1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:15.000
 perhaps not to the level of millions and billions,

1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:16.280
 but it feels like it could be expanded.

1:10:16.280 --> 1:10:20.280
 So how do we find the right interface, you think,

1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:24.840
 for having a little bit of a collective here

1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:26.080
 that has agency?

1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:28.080
 You're right that there's many different ways

1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:30.000
 that we can build trust with each other.

1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:30.840
 Yeah.

1:10:30.840 --> 1:10:33.960
 My friend Joe Edelman talks about a few different ways

1:10:33.960 --> 1:10:38.960
 that, you know, mutual appreciation, trustful conflict,

1:10:39.360 --> 1:10:41.320
 just experiencing something like, you know,

1:10:41.320 --> 1:10:43.640
 there's a variety of different things that we can do,

1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:48.480
 but all those things take time and you have to be present.

1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:50.320
 The less present you are, I mean, there's just, again,

1:10:50.320 --> 1:10:51.560
 a no free lunch principle here.

1:10:51.560 --> 1:10:54.200
 The less present you are, the more of them you can do,

1:10:54.200 --> 1:10:56.800
 but then the less connection you build.

1:10:56.800 --> 1:10:59.440
 So I think there is sort of a human capacity issue

1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:00.280
 around some of these things.

1:11:00.280 --> 1:11:04.800
 Now, that being said, if we can use certain technologies,

1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:07.520
 so for instance, if I write a little monograph

1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:08.720
 on my view of the world,

1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:10.600
 you read it asynchronously at some point,

1:11:10.600 --> 1:11:11.920
 and you're like, wow, Peter, this is great.

1:11:11.920 --> 1:11:12.800
 Here's mine.

1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:13.640
 I read it.

1:11:13.640 --> 1:11:15.320
 I'm like, wow, Lex, this is awesome.

1:11:15.320 --> 1:11:18.720
 We can be friends without having to spend 10 years,

1:11:18.720 --> 1:11:20.560
 you know, figuring all this stuff out together.

1:11:20.560 --> 1:11:22.200
 We just read each other's thing and be like,

1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:24.800
 oh yeah, this guy's exactly in my wheelhouse

1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:26.080
 and vice versa.

1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:30.520
 And we can then, you know, connect just a few times a year

1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:33.040
 and maintain a high trust relationship.

1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:34.320
 It can be expanded a little bit,

1:11:34.320 --> 1:11:35.840
 but it also requires,

1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:37.320
 these things are not all technological in nature.

1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:39.640
 It requires the individual themselves

1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:41.680
 to have a certain level of capacity,

1:11:41.680 --> 1:11:44.760
 to have a certain lack of neuroticism, right?

1:11:44.760 --> 1:11:48.080
 If you want to use like the ocean big five sort of model,

1:11:48.080 --> 1:11:49.680
 people have to be pretty centered.

1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:50.640
 The less centered you are,

1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:52.840
 the fewer authentic connections you can really build

1:11:52.840 --> 1:11:54.800
 for a particular unit of time.

1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:55.840
 It just takes more time.

1:11:55.840 --> 1:11:57.160
 Other people have to put up with your crap.

1:11:57.160 --> 1:11:58.120
 Like there's just a lot of the stuff

1:11:58.120 --> 1:12:00.000
 that you have to deal with

1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.240
 if you are not so well balanced, right?

1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:04.760
 So yes, we can help people get better

1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:06.760
 to where they can develop more relationships faster,

1:12:06.760 --> 1:12:09.560
 and then you can maybe expand Dunbar number by quite a bit,

1:12:09.560 --> 1:12:10.640
 but you're not going to do it.

1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:12.880
 I think it's going to be hard to get it beyond 10X,

1:12:12.880 --> 1:12:16.280
 kind of the rough swag of what it is, you know?

1:12:16.280 --> 1:12:20.840
 Well, don't you think that AI systems could be an addition

1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:22.640
 to the Dunbar's number?

1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:23.480
 So like why?

1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:25.600
 Do you count as one system or multiple AI systems?

1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:26.560
 Multiple AI systems.

1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:28.600
 So I do believe that AI systems,

1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:31.360
 for them to integrate into human society as it is now,

1:12:31.360 --> 1:12:32.600
 have to have a sense of agency.

1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:35.280
 So there has to be a individual

1:12:35.280 --> 1:12:37.600
 because otherwise we wouldn't relate to them.

1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:40.240
 We could engage certain kinds of individuals

1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:42.680
 to make sense of them for us and be almost like,

1:12:42.680 --> 1:12:44.960
 did you ever watch Star Trek?

1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:46.480
 Like Voyager, like there's the Volta,

1:12:46.480 --> 1:12:47.640
 who are like the interfaces,

1:12:47.640 --> 1:12:50.480
 the ambassadors for the Dominion.

1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:53.120
 We may have ambassadors that speak

1:12:53.120 --> 1:12:54.400
 on behalf of these systems.

1:12:54.400 --> 1:12:56.160
 They're like the Mentats of Dune, maybe,

1:12:56.160 --> 1:12:57.280
 or something like this.

1:12:57.280 --> 1:12:59.320
 I mean, we already have this to some extent.

1:12:59.320 --> 1:13:01.160
 If you look at the biggest sort of,

1:13:01.160 --> 1:13:02.120
 I wouldn't say AI system,

1:13:02.120 --> 1:13:04.080
 but the biggest cybernetic system in the world

1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:05.160
 is the financial markets.

1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:08.000
 It runs outside of any individual's control,

1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:09.920
 and you have an entire stack of people on Wall Street,

1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:13.240
 Wall Street analysts to CNBC reporters, whatever.

1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:16.920
 They're all helping to communicate what does this mean?

1:13:16.920 --> 1:13:18.120
 You know, like Jim Cramer,

1:13:18.120 --> 1:13:19.560
 like coming around and yelling and stuff.

1:13:19.560 --> 1:13:22.560
 Like all of these people are part of that lowering

1:13:22.560 --> 1:13:26.320
 of the complexity there to meet sense,

1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:28.440
 you know, to help do sense making for people

1:13:28.440 --> 1:13:29.800
 at whatever capacity they're at.

1:13:29.800 --> 1:13:31.560
 And I don't see this changing with AI systems.

1:13:31.560 --> 1:13:33.400
 I think you would have ringside commentators

1:13:33.400 --> 1:13:34.560
 talking about all this stuff

1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:36.600
 that this AI system is trying to do over here, over here,

1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:39.120
 because it's actually a super intelligence.

1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:40.800
 So if you want to talk about humans interfacing,

1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:42.480
 making first contact with the super intelligence,

1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:43.600
 we're already there.

1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:44.800
 We do it pretty poorly.

1:13:44.800 --> 1:13:47.240
 And if you look at the gradient of power and money,

1:13:47.240 --> 1:13:48.800
 what happens is the people closest to it

1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:50.960
 will absolutely exploit their distance

1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:54.360
 for personal financial gain.

1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:56.080
 So we should look at that and be like,

1:13:56.080 --> 1:13:57.320
 oh, well, that's probably what the future

1:13:57.320 --> 1:13:58.880
 will look like as well.

1:13:58.880 --> 1:14:00.240
 But nonetheless, I mean,

1:14:00.240 --> 1:14:01.360
 we're already doing this kind of thing.

1:14:01.360 --> 1:14:03.800
 So in the future, we can have AI systems,

1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:05.720
 but you're still gonna have to trust people

1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:08.400
 to bridge the sense making gap to them.

1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:10.800
 See, I just feel like there could be

1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:13.880
 like millions of AI systems that have,

1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:17.080
 have agencies, you have,

1:14:17.080 --> 1:14:19.480
 when you say one super intelligence,

1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:22.280
 super intelligence in that context means

1:14:22.280 --> 1:14:26.080
 it's able to solve particular problems extremely well.

1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:29.240
 But there's some aspect of human like intelligence

1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:32.320
 that's necessary to be integrated into human society.

1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:33.720
 So not financial markets,

1:14:33.720 --> 1:14:36.760
 not sort of weather prediction systems,

1:14:36.760 --> 1:14:39.680
 or I don't know, logistics optimization.

1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:43.240
 I'm more referring to things that you interact with

1:14:43.240 --> 1:14:45.120
 on the intellectual level.

1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:47.120
 And that I think requires,

1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:48.920
 there has to be a backstory.

1:14:48.920 --> 1:14:50.080
 There has to be a personality.

1:14:50.080 --> 1:14:53.320
 I believe it has to fear its own mortality in a genuine way.

1:14:53.320 --> 1:14:56.560
 Like there has to be all,

1:14:56.560 --> 1:14:59.680
 many of the elements that we humans experience

1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:01.920
 that are fundamental to the human condition,

1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:03.840
 because otherwise we would not have

1:15:03.840 --> 1:15:05.840
 a deep connection with it.

1:15:05.840 --> 1:15:07.800
 But I don't think having a deep connection with it

1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:10.600
 is necessarily going to stop us from building a thing

1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:13.360
 that has quite an alien intelligence aspect here.

1:15:13.360 --> 1:15:16.640
 So the other kind of alien intelligence on this planet

1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:18.640
 is the octopuses or octopodes

1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:19.720
 or whatever you wanna call them.

1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:21.000
 Octopi. Octopi, yeah.

1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:22.400
 There's a little controversy

1:15:22.400 --> 1:15:23.720
 as to what the plural is, I guess.

1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:26.560
 But an octopus. I look forward to your letters.

1:15:26.560 --> 1:15:28.880
 Yeah, an octopus,

1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:32.120
 it really acts as a collective intelligence

1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:34.320
 of eight intelligent arms, right?

1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:37.000
 Its arms have a tremendous amount of neural density to them.

1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:40.360
 And I see if we can build,

1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:42.000
 I mean, just let's go with what you're saying.

1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:44.400
 If we build a singular intelligence

1:15:44.400 --> 1:15:48.080
 that interfaces with humans that has a sense of agency

1:15:48.080 --> 1:15:49.600
 so it can run the cybernetic loop

1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:51.080
 and develop its own theory of mind

1:15:51.080 --> 1:15:52.960
 as well as its theory of action,

1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:54.040
 all these things, I agree with you

1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:56.240
 that that's the necessary components

1:15:56.240 --> 1:15:57.800
 to build a real intelligence, right?

1:15:57.800 --> 1:15:58.720
 There's gotta be something at stake.

1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:00.000
 It's gotta make a decision.

1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:01.280
 It's gotta then run the OODA loop.

1:16:01.280 --> 1:16:03.000
 Okay, so we build one of those.

1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:03.880
 Well, if we can build one of those,

1:16:03.880 --> 1:16:05.640
 we can probably build 5 million of them.

1:16:05.640 --> 1:16:07.400
 So we build 5 million of them.

1:16:07.400 --> 1:16:09.960
 And if their cognitive systems are already digitized

1:16:09.960 --> 1:16:12.000
 and already kind of there,

1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:13.720
 we stick an antenna on each of them,

1:16:13.720 --> 1:16:15.440
 bring it all back to a hive mind

1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:17.640
 that maybe doesn't make all the individual decisions

1:16:17.640 --> 1:16:19.360
 for them, but treats each one

1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:21.480
 as almost like a neuronal input

1:16:21.480 --> 1:16:23.880
 of a much higher bandwidth and fidelity,

1:16:23.880 --> 1:16:25.920
 going back to a central system

1:16:25.920 --> 1:16:30.240
 that is then able to perceive much broader dynamics

1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:31.120
 that we can't see.

1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:32.600
 In the same way that a phased array radar, right?

1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:34.440
 You think about how phased array radar works.

1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:36.200
 It's just sensitivity.

1:16:36.200 --> 1:16:39.120
 It's just radars, and then it's hypersensitivity

1:16:39.120 --> 1:16:41.160
 and really great timing between all of them.

1:16:41.160 --> 1:16:42.600
 And with a flat array,

1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:44.740
 it's as good as a curved radar dish, right?

1:16:44.740 --> 1:16:45.580
 So with these things,

1:16:45.580 --> 1:16:47.800
 it's a phased array of cybernetic systems

1:16:47.800 --> 1:16:50.160
 that'll give the centralized intelligence

1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:55.040
 much, much better, a much higher fidelity understanding

1:16:55.040 --> 1:16:56.600
 of what's actually happening in the environment.

1:16:56.600 --> 1:16:57.720
 But the more power,

1:16:57.720 --> 1:17:02.480
 the more understanding the central super intelligence has,

1:17:02.480 --> 1:17:06.600
 the dumber the individual like fingers

1:17:06.600 --> 1:17:08.080
 of this intelligence are, I think.

1:17:08.080 --> 1:17:08.920
 I think you...

1:17:08.920 --> 1:17:09.760
 Not necessarily.

1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:10.580
 In my sense...

1:17:10.580 --> 1:17:11.420
 I don't see what has to be.

1:17:11.420 --> 1:17:13.560
 This argument, there has to be,

1:17:13.560 --> 1:17:15.660
 the experience of the individual agent

1:17:15.660 --> 1:17:20.660
 has to have the full richness of the human like experience.

1:17:20.840 --> 1:17:23.800
 You have to be able to be driving the car in the rain,

1:17:23.800 --> 1:17:25.240
 listening to Bruce Springsteen,

1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:28.280
 and all of a sudden break out in tears

1:17:28.280 --> 1:17:30.580
 because remembering something that happened to you

1:17:30.580 --> 1:17:31.420
 in high school.

1:17:31.420 --> 1:17:32.240
 We can implant those memories

1:17:32.240 --> 1:17:33.080
 if that's really needed.

1:17:33.080 --> 1:17:33.920
 But no, I'm...

1:17:33.920 --> 1:17:34.960
 No, but the central agency,

1:17:34.960 --> 1:17:37.720
 like I guess I'm saying for, in my view,

1:17:37.720 --> 1:17:39.620
 for intelligence to be born,

1:17:39.620 --> 1:17:43.860
 you have to have a decentralization.

1:17:43.860 --> 1:17:47.280
 Like each one has to struggle and reach.

1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:51.920
 So each one in excess of energy has to reach for order

1:17:51.920 --> 1:17:54.420
 as opposed to a central place doing so.

1:17:54.420 --> 1:17:55.640
 Have you ever read like some sci fi

1:17:55.640 --> 1:17:58.820
 where there's like hive minds?

1:17:58.820 --> 1:18:01.080
 Like the Wernher Vinge, I think has one of these.

1:18:01.080 --> 1:18:05.160
 And then some of the stuff from the Commonwealth Saga,

1:18:05.160 --> 1:18:06.960
 the idea that you're an individual,

1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:09.240
 but you're connected with like a few other individuals

1:18:09.240 --> 1:18:10.300
 telepathically as well.

1:18:10.300 --> 1:18:12.560
 And together you form a swarm.

1:18:12.560 --> 1:18:14.580
 So if you are, I ask you,

1:18:14.580 --> 1:18:18.040
 what do you think is the experience of if you are like,

1:18:18.040 --> 1:18:18.920
 well, a Borg, right?

1:18:18.920 --> 1:18:22.600
 If you are one, if you're part of this hive mind,

1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:25.360
 outside of all the aesthetics, forget the aesthetics,

1:18:25.360 --> 1:18:28.360
 internally, what is your experience like?

1:18:28.360 --> 1:18:30.600
 Because I have a theory as to what that looks like.

1:18:30.600 --> 1:18:34.280
 The one question I have for you about that experience is

1:18:34.280 --> 1:18:38.560
 how much is there a feeling of freedom, of free will?

1:18:38.560 --> 1:18:43.280
 Because I obviously as a human, very unbiased,

1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:46.120
 but also somebody who values freedom and biased,

1:18:46.120 --> 1:18:50.200
 it feels like the experience of freedom is essential for

1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:55.960
 trying stuff out, to being creative

1:18:55.960 --> 1:18:59.080
 and doing something truly novel, which is at the core of.

1:18:59.080 --> 1:19:00.920
 Yeah, well, I don't think you have to lose any freedom

1:19:00.920 --> 1:19:02.040
 when you're in that mode.

1:19:02.040 --> 1:19:04.560
 Because I think what happens is we think,

1:19:04.560 --> 1:19:06.920
 we still think, I mean, you're still thinking about this

1:19:06.920 --> 1:19:09.800
 in a sense of a top down command and control hierarchy,

1:19:09.800 --> 1:19:12.280
 which is not what it has to be at all.

1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:16.040
 I think the experience, so I'll just show by cards here.

1:19:16.040 --> 1:19:19.720
 I think the experience of being a robot in that robot swarm,

1:19:19.720 --> 1:19:22.840
 a robot who has agency over their own local environment

1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:23.880
 that's doing sense making

1:19:23.880 --> 1:19:25.880
 and reporting it back to the hive mind,

1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:28.840
 I think that robot's experience would be one,

1:19:28.840 --> 1:19:31.000
 when the hive mind is working well,

1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:34.360
 it would be an experience of like talking to God, right?

1:19:34.360 --> 1:19:37.480
 That you essentially are reporting to,

1:19:37.480 --> 1:19:38.760
 you're sort of saying, here's what I see.

1:19:38.760 --> 1:19:40.200
 I think this is what's gonna happen over here.

1:19:40.200 --> 1:19:41.240
 I'm gonna go do this thing.

1:19:41.240 --> 1:19:42.840
 Because I think if I'm gonna do this,

1:19:42.840 --> 1:19:45.400
 this will make this change happen in the environment.

1:19:45.400 --> 1:19:50.400
 And then God, she may tell you, that's great.

1:19:50.400 --> 1:19:52.400
 And in fact, your brothers and sisters will join you

1:19:52.400 --> 1:19:54.040
 to help make this go better, right?

1:19:54.040 --> 1:19:56.440
 And then she can let your brothers and sisters know,

1:19:56.440 --> 1:19:58.680
 hey, Peter's gonna go do this thing.

1:19:58.680 --> 1:19:59.880
 Would you like to help him?

1:19:59.880 --> 1:20:01.640
 Because we think that this will make this thing go better.

1:20:01.640 --> 1:20:03.000
 And they'll say, yes, we'll help him.

1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:05.560
 So the whole thing could be actually very emergent.

1:20:05.560 --> 1:20:09.160
 The sense of, what does it feel like to be a cell

1:20:09.160 --> 1:20:11.880
 and a network that is alive, that is generative.

1:20:11.880 --> 1:20:14.760
 And I think actually the feeling is serendipity.

1:20:16.040 --> 1:20:20.360
 That there's random order, not random disorder or chaos,

1:20:20.360 --> 1:20:24.040
 but random order, just when you need it to hear Bruce Springsteen,

1:20:24.040 --> 1:20:28.040
 you turn on the radio and bam, it's Bruce Springsteen, right?

1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:30.600
 That feeling of serendipity, I feel like,

1:20:30.600 --> 1:20:31.880
 this is a bit of a flight of fancy,

1:20:31.880 --> 1:20:35.240
 but every cell in your body must have,

1:20:35.240 --> 1:20:37.320
 what does it feel like to be a cell in your body?

1:20:37.320 --> 1:20:39.320
 When it needs sugar, there's sugar.

1:20:39.320 --> 1:20:41.640
 When it needs oxygen, there's just oxygen.

1:20:41.640 --> 1:20:43.080
 Now, when it needs to go and do its work

1:20:43.080 --> 1:20:46.120
 and pull like as one of your muscle fibers, right?

1:20:46.120 --> 1:20:48.120
 It does its work and it's great.

1:20:48.120 --> 1:20:49.560
 It contributes to the cause, right?

1:20:49.560 --> 1:20:51.960
 So this is all, again, a flight of fancy,

1:20:51.960 --> 1:20:53.880
 but I think as we extrapolate up,

1:20:53.880 --> 1:20:56.520
 what does it feel like to be an independent individual

1:20:56.520 --> 1:20:58.200
 with some bounded sense of freedom?

1:20:58.200 --> 1:20:59.640
 All sense of freedom is actually bounded,

1:20:59.640 --> 1:21:01.240
 but it was a bounded sense of freedom

1:21:01.240 --> 1:21:04.360
 that still lives within a network that has order to it.

1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:06.600
 And I feel like it has to be a feeling of serendipity.

1:21:06.600 --> 1:21:10.680
 So the cell, there's a feeling of serendipity, even though.

1:21:10.680 --> 1:21:12.680
 It has no way of explaining why it's getting oxygen

1:21:12.680 --> 1:21:13.480
 and sugar when it gets it.

1:21:13.480 --> 1:21:17.400
 So you have to, each individual component has to be too dumb

1:21:17.400 --> 1:21:19.240
 to understand the big picture.

1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:22.840
 No, the big picture is bigger than what it can understand.

1:21:22.840 --> 1:21:24.680
 But isn't that an essential characteristic

1:21:24.680 --> 1:21:27.160
 of the individual is to be too dumb

1:21:27.880 --> 1:21:29.480
 to understand the bigger picture.

1:21:29.480 --> 1:21:31.160
 Like not dumb necessarily,

1:21:31.160 --> 1:21:33.960
 but limited in its capacity to understand.

1:21:33.960 --> 1:21:36.680
 Because the moment you understand,

1:21:36.680 --> 1:21:39.960
 I feel like that leads to, if you tell me now

1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:43.480
 that there are some bigger intelligence

1:21:43.480 --> 1:21:44.840
 controlling everything I do,

1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:47.960
 intelligence broadly defined, meaning like,

1:21:47.960 --> 1:21:50.840
 you know, even the Sam Harris thing, there's no free will.

1:21:51.480 --> 1:21:55.160
 If I'm smart enough to truly understand that that's the case,

1:21:56.360 --> 1:21:58.840
 that's gonna, I don't know if I.

1:21:58.840 --> 1:22:00.920
 We have philosophical breakdown, right?

1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:03.560
 Because we're in the West and we're pumped full of this stuff

1:22:03.560 --> 1:22:06.760
 of like, you are a golden, fully free individual

1:22:06.760 --> 1:22:08.360
 with all your freedoms and all your liberties

1:22:08.360 --> 1:22:10.520
 and go grab a gun and shoot whatever you want to.

1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:14.360
 No, it's actually, you don't actually have a lot of these,

1:22:14.360 --> 1:22:15.800
 you're not unconstrained,

1:22:15.800 --> 1:22:19.080
 but the areas where you can manifest agency,

1:22:20.120 --> 1:22:21.720
 you're free to do those things.

1:22:21.720 --> 1:22:23.160
 You can say whatever you want on this podcast.

1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:24.280
 You can create a podcast, right?

1:22:24.280 --> 1:22:24.760
 Yeah.

1:22:24.760 --> 1:22:27.720
 You're not, I mean, you have a lot of this kind of freedom,

1:22:27.720 --> 1:22:30.040
 but even as you're doing this, you are actually,

1:22:30.040 --> 1:22:32.840
 I guess where the denouement of this is that

1:22:33.480 --> 1:22:37.720
 we are already intelligent agents in such a system, right?

1:22:37.720 --> 1:22:39.960
 In that one of these like robots

1:22:39.960 --> 1:22:42.280
 of one of 5 million little swarm robots

1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:43.480
 or one of the Borg,

1:22:43.480 --> 1:22:45.320
 they're just posting on internal bulletin board.

1:22:45.320 --> 1:22:46.200
 I mean, maybe the Borg cube

1:22:46.200 --> 1:22:48.440
 is just a giant Facebook machine floating in space

1:22:48.440 --> 1:22:50.360
 and everyone's just posting on there.

1:22:50.360 --> 1:22:52.680
 They're just posting really fast and like, oh yeah.

1:22:52.680 --> 1:22:53.720
 It's called the metaverse now.

1:22:53.720 --> 1:22:54.840
 That's called the metaverse, that's right.

1:22:54.840 --> 1:22:55.480
 Here's the enterprise.

1:22:55.480 --> 1:22:56.440
 Maybe we should all go shoot it.

1:22:56.440 --> 1:22:58.840
 Yeah, everyone upvotes and they're gonna go shoot it, right?

1:22:58.840 --> 1:23:02.120
 But we already are part of a human online

1:23:02.120 --> 1:23:03.640
 collaborative environment

1:23:03.640 --> 1:23:05.640
 and collaborative sensemaking system.

1:23:05.640 --> 1:23:07.240
 It's not very good yet.

1:23:07.240 --> 1:23:10.760
 It's got the overhangs of zombie sensemaking institutions

1:23:10.760 --> 1:23:13.240
 all over it, but as that washes away

1:23:13.240 --> 1:23:15.400
 and as we get better at this,

1:23:15.400 --> 1:23:17.880
 we are going to see humanity improving

1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:21.800
 at speeds that are unthinkable in the past.

1:23:21.800 --> 1:23:23.640
 And it's not because anyone's freedoms were limited.

1:23:23.640 --> 1:23:24.520
 In fact, the open source,

1:23:24.520 --> 1:23:26.680
 and we started this with open source software, right?

1:23:26.680 --> 1:23:29.240
 The collaboration, what the internet surfaced

1:23:29.240 --> 1:23:31.160
 was the ability for people all over the world

1:23:31.160 --> 1:23:32.920
 to collaborate and produce some of the most

1:23:32.920 --> 1:23:35.800
 foundational software that's in use today, right?

1:23:35.800 --> 1:23:36.920
 That entire ecosystem was created

1:23:36.920 --> 1:23:38.120
 by collaborators all over the place.

1:23:38.840 --> 1:23:42.760
 So these online kind of swarm kind of things

1:23:42.760 --> 1:23:44.280
 are not novel.

1:23:44.280 --> 1:23:47.320
 It's just, I'm just suggesting that future AI systems,

1:23:47.320 --> 1:23:48.840
 if you can build one smart system,

1:23:49.480 --> 1:23:51.400
 you have no reason not to build multiple.

1:23:51.400 --> 1:23:52.120
 If you build multiple,

1:23:52.120 --> 1:23:53.800
 there's no reason not to integrate them all

1:23:53.800 --> 1:23:57.720
 into a collective sensemaking substrate.

1:23:57.720 --> 1:24:00.360
 And that thing will certainly have immersion intelligence

1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:01.720
 that none of the individuals

1:24:01.720 --> 1:24:03.400
 and probably not any of the human designers

1:24:03.400 --> 1:24:06.680
 will be able to really put a bow around and explain.

1:24:06.680 --> 1:24:09.160
 But in some sense, would that AI system

1:24:09.160 --> 1:24:13.160
 still be able to go like rural Texas,

1:24:13.160 --> 1:24:16.840
 buy a ranch, go off the grid, go full survivalist?

1:24:16.840 --> 1:24:20.200
 Like, can you disconnect from the hive mind?

1:24:20.200 --> 1:24:23.240
 You may not want to.

1:24:25.080 --> 1:24:27.960
 So to be ineffective, to be intelligent.

1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:30.200
 You have access to way more intelligence capability

1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:31.560
 if you're plugged into five million other

1:24:31.560 --> 1:24:32.760
 really, really smart cyborgs.

1:24:33.320 --> 1:24:34.040
 Why would you leave?

1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:37.400
 So like there's a word control that comes to mind.

1:24:37.400 --> 1:24:39.800
 So it doesn't feel like control,

1:24:39.800 --> 1:24:43.080
 like overbearing control.

1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:44.600
 It's just knowledge.

1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:46.360
 I think systems, well, this is to your point.

1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:47.640
 I mean, look at how much,

1:24:47.640 --> 1:24:49.800
 how uncomfortable you are with this concept, right?

1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:52.280
 I think systems that feel like overbearing control

1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:54.760
 will not evolutionarily win out.

1:24:54.760 --> 1:24:57.480
 I think systems that give their individual elements

1:24:57.480 --> 1:25:00.280
 the feeling of serendipity and the feeling of agency

1:25:00.280 --> 1:25:04.280
 that that will, those systems will win.

1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:05.720
 But that's not to say that there will not be

1:25:05.720 --> 1:25:08.040
 emergent higher level order on top of it.

1:25:09.560 --> 1:25:11.320
 And that's the thing, that's the philosophical breakdown

1:25:11.320 --> 1:25:13.480
 that we're staring right at,

1:25:13.480 --> 1:25:14.840
 which is in the Western mind,

1:25:14.840 --> 1:25:17.560
 I think there's a very sharp delineation

1:25:17.560 --> 1:25:19.480
 between explicit control,

1:25:21.240 --> 1:25:23.320
 Cartesian, like what is the vector?

1:25:23.320 --> 1:25:24.280
 Where is the position?

1:25:24.280 --> 1:25:25.560
 Where is it going?

1:25:25.560 --> 1:25:26.680
 It's completely deterministic.

1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:30.840
 And kind of this idea that things emerge.

1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:32.840
 Everything we see is the emergent patterns

1:25:32.840 --> 1:25:33.960
 of other things.

1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:36.600
 And there is agency when there's extra energy.

1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:42.200
 So you have spoken about a kind of meaning crisis

1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:43.320
 that we're going through.

1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:50.520
 But it feels like since we invented sex and death,

1:25:50.920 --> 1:25:52.520
 we broadly speaking,

1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:54.760
 we've been searching for a kind of meaning.

1:25:54.760 --> 1:25:56.840
 So it feels like a human civilization

1:25:56.840 --> 1:25:58.200
 has been going through a meaning crisis

1:25:58.200 --> 1:26:00.840
 of different flavors throughout its history.

1:26:00.840 --> 1:26:05.800
 Why is, how is this particular meaning crisis different?

1:26:05.800 --> 1:26:09.000
 Or is it really a crisis and it wasn't previously?

1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:09.960
 What's your sense?

1:26:09.960 --> 1:26:11.400
 A lot of human history,

1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:13.080
 there wasn't so much a meaning crisis.

1:26:13.080 --> 1:26:14.280
 There was just a like food

1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:16.920
 and not getting eaten by bears crisis, right?

1:26:16.920 --> 1:26:18.840
 Once you get to a point where you can make food,

1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:20.200
 there was the like not getting killed

1:26:20.200 --> 1:26:21.960
 by other humans crisis.

1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:24.760
 So sitting around wondering what is it all about,

1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:26.600
 it's actually a relatively recent luxury.

1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:29.640
 And to some extent, the meaning crisis coming out of that

1:26:29.640 --> 1:26:33.000
 is precisely because, well, it's not precisely because,

1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:36.200
 I believe that meaning is the consequence of

1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:40.200
 when we make consequential decisions,

1:26:40.200 --> 1:26:42.440
 it's tied to agency, right?

1:26:42.440 --> 1:26:44.760
 When we make consequential decisions,

1:26:44.760 --> 1:26:46.120
 that generates meaning.

1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:47.960
 So if we make a lot of decisions,

1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:50.040
 but we don't see the consequences of them,

1:26:50.040 --> 1:26:52.200
 then it feels like what was the point, right?

1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:53.640
 But if there's all these big things

1:26:53.640 --> 1:26:55.160
 that we don't see the consequences of,

1:26:55.160 --> 1:26:57.000
 right, but if there's all these big things happening,

1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:58.280
 but we're just along for the ride,

1:26:58.280 --> 1:26:59.880
 then it also does not feel very meaningful.

1:27:00.680 --> 1:27:01.880
 Meaning, as far as I can tell,

1:27:01.880 --> 1:27:03.960
 this is my working definition of CERCA 2021,

1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:08.280
 is generally the result of a person

1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:09.720
 making a consequential decision,

1:27:09.720 --> 1:27:12.120
 acting on it and then seeing the consequences of it.

1:27:12.120 --> 1:27:16.520
 So historically, just when humans are in survival mode,

1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:18.440
 you're making consequential decisions all the time.

1:27:19.400 --> 1:27:20.760
 So there's not a lack of meaning

1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:23.320
 because like you either got eaten or you didn't, right?

1:27:23.320 --> 1:27:25.480
 You got some food and that's great, you feel good.

1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:27.400
 Like these are all consequential decisions.

1:27:27.400 --> 1:27:32.840
 Only in the post fossil fuel and industrial revolution

1:27:33.640 --> 1:27:35.960
 could we create a massive leisure class.

1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:38.600
 I could sit around not being threatened by bears,

1:27:39.240 --> 1:27:40.120
 not starving to death,

1:27:43.480 --> 1:27:44.680
 making decisions somewhat,

1:27:44.680 --> 1:27:47.320
 but a lot of times not seeing the consequences

1:27:47.320 --> 1:27:48.440
 of any decisions they make.

1:27:49.080 --> 1:27:51.400
 The general sort of sense of anomie,

1:27:51.400 --> 1:27:53.240
 I think that is the French term for it,

1:27:53.240 --> 1:27:55.400
 in the wake of the consumer society,

1:27:55.400 --> 1:27:58.520
 in the wake of mass media telling everyone,

1:27:58.520 --> 1:28:01.960
 hey, choosing between Hermes and Chanel

1:28:01.960 --> 1:28:03.080
 is a meaningful decision.

1:28:03.080 --> 1:28:04.120
 No, it's not.

1:28:04.120 --> 1:28:05.560
 I don't know what either of those mean.

1:28:05.560 --> 1:28:10.840
 Oh, they're high end luxury purses and crap like that.

1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:13.480
 But the point is that we give people the idea

1:28:13.480 --> 1:28:15.000
 that consumption is meaning,

1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:17.480
 that making a choice of this team versus that team,

1:28:17.480 --> 1:28:20.040
 spectating has meaning.

1:28:20.040 --> 1:28:22.440
 So we produce all of these different things

1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:25.240
 that are as if meaning, right?

1:28:25.240 --> 1:28:28.200
 But really making a decision that has no consequences for us.

1:28:28.840 --> 1:28:30.920
 And so that creates the meaning crisis.

1:28:30.920 --> 1:28:33.240
 Well, you're saying choosing between Chanel

1:28:33.240 --> 1:28:35.240
 and the other one has no consequence.

1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:38.120
 I mean, why is one more meaningful than the other?

1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:39.480
 It's not that it's more meaningful than the other.

1:28:39.480 --> 1:28:42.440
 It's that you make a decision between these two brands

1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:45.080
 and you're told this brand will make me look better

1:28:45.080 --> 1:28:45.800
 in front of other people.

1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:47.000
 If I buy this brand of car,

1:28:47.560 --> 1:28:50.040
 if I wear that brand of apparel, right?

1:28:50.040 --> 1:28:54.120
 Like a lot of decisions we make are around consumption,

1:28:54.120 --> 1:28:56.520
 but consumption by itself doesn't actually yield meaning.

1:28:57.080 --> 1:28:59.960
 Gaining social status does provide meaning.

1:28:59.960 --> 1:29:03.560
 So that's why in this era of abundant production,

1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:07.320
 so many things turn into status games.

1:29:07.320 --> 1:29:09.320
 The NFT kind of explosion is a similar kind of thing.

1:29:09.880 --> 1:29:11.880
 Everywhere there are status games

1:29:11.880 --> 1:29:15.160
 because we just have so much excess production.

1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:18.360
 But aren't those status games a source of meaning?

1:29:18.360 --> 1:29:22.360
 Like why do the games we play have to be grounded

1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:24.120
 in physical reality like they are

1:29:24.120 --> 1:29:26.040
 when you're trying to run away from lions?

1:29:26.040 --> 1:29:30.280
 Why can't we, in this virtuality world, on social media,

1:29:30.280 --> 1:29:32.200
 why can't we play the games on social media,

1:29:32.200 --> 1:29:33.320
 even the dark ones?

1:29:33.320 --> 1:29:35.160
 Right, we can, we can.

1:29:35.160 --> 1:29:37.640
 But you're saying that's creating a meaning crisis.

1:29:37.640 --> 1:29:39.080
 Well, there's a meaning crisis

1:29:39.080 --> 1:29:41.000
 in that there's two aspects of it.

1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:43.720
 Number one, playing those kinds of status games

1:29:44.520 --> 1:29:46.600
 oftentimes requires destroying the planet

1:29:46.600 --> 1:29:51.800
 because it ties to consumption,

1:29:51.800 --> 1:29:54.280
 consuming the latest and greatest version of a thing,

1:29:54.280 --> 1:29:56.840
 buying the latest limited edition sneaker

1:29:56.840 --> 1:29:58.120
 and throwing out all the old ones.

1:29:58.120 --> 1:29:59.000
 Maybe it keeps in the old ones,

1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:01.000
 but the amount of sneakers we have to cut up

1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:02.200
 and destroy every year

1:30:02.680 --> 1:30:05.640
 to create artificial scarcity for the next generation, right?

1:30:05.640 --> 1:30:07.720
 This is kind of stuff that's not great.

1:30:07.720 --> 1:30:08.600
 It's not great at all.

1:30:09.880 --> 1:30:13.400
 So conspicuous consumption fueling status games

1:30:13.400 --> 1:30:16.040
 is really bad for the planet, not sustainable.

1:30:16.040 --> 1:30:19.640
 The second thing is you can play these kinds of status games,

1:30:19.640 --> 1:30:22.520
 but then what it does is it renders you captured

1:30:22.520 --> 1:30:23.640
 to the virtual environment.

1:30:24.360 --> 1:30:26.760
 The status games that really wealthy people are playing

1:30:26.760 --> 1:30:28.440
 are all around the hard resources

1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:30.440
 where they're gonna build the factories,

1:30:30.440 --> 1:30:31.800
 they're gonna have the fuel in the rare earths

1:30:31.800 --> 1:30:33.160
 to make the next generation of robots.

1:30:33.160 --> 1:30:34.760
 They're then going to run game,

1:30:34.760 --> 1:30:36.680
 run circles around you and your children.

1:30:37.240 --> 1:30:38.760
 So that's another reason not to play

1:30:38.760 --> 1:30:40.040
 those virtual status games.

1:30:40.040 --> 1:30:44.040
 So you're saying ultimately the big picture game is won

1:30:44.040 --> 1:30:46.840
 by people who have access or control

1:30:46.840 --> 1:30:48.360
 over actual hard resources.

1:30:48.360 --> 1:30:51.080
 So you can't, you don't see a society

1:30:51.080 --> 1:30:55.400
 where most of the games are played in the virtual space.

1:30:55.400 --> 1:30:57.160
 They'll be captured in the physical space.

1:30:57.160 --> 1:30:57.960
 It all builds.

1:30:57.960 --> 1:31:00.840
 It's just like the stack of human being, right?

1:31:00.840 --> 1:31:04.360
 If you only play the game at the cultural

1:31:04.360 --> 1:31:05.960
 and then intellectual level,

1:31:05.960 --> 1:31:07.320
 then the people with the hard resources

1:31:07.320 --> 1:31:10.920
 and access to layer zero physical are going to own you.

1:31:10.920 --> 1:31:13.480
 But isn't money not connected to,

1:31:13.480 --> 1:31:15.560
 or less and less connected to hard resources

1:31:15.560 --> 1:31:17.080
 and money still seems to work?

1:31:17.080 --> 1:31:18.520
 It's a virtual technology.

1:31:18.520 --> 1:31:19.720
 There's different kinds of money.

1:31:20.520 --> 1:31:22.280
 Part of the reason that some of the stuff is able

1:31:22.280 --> 1:31:29.280
 to go a little unhinged is because the big sovereignties

1:31:29.960 --> 1:31:32.040
 where one spends money and uses money

1:31:32.040 --> 1:31:33.640
 and plays money games and inflates money,

1:31:34.600 --> 1:31:38.440
 their ability to adjudicate the physical resources

1:31:38.440 --> 1:31:40.120
 and hard resources and the resources

1:31:40.120 --> 1:31:42.200
 and hard resources on land and things like that,

1:31:42.200 --> 1:31:44.040
 those have not been challenged in a very long time.

1:31:45.480 --> 1:31:47.640
 So, you know, we went off the gold standard.

1:31:47.640 --> 1:31:50.360
 Most money is not connected to physical resources.

1:31:51.640 --> 1:31:52.520
 It's an idea.

1:31:53.640 --> 1:31:57.480
 And that idea is very closely connected to status.

1:31:59.880 --> 1:32:03.000
 But it's also tied to like, it's actually tied to law.

1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:04.680
 It is tied to some physical hard things

1:32:04.680 --> 1:32:06.120
 so you have to pay your taxes.

1:32:06.120 --> 1:32:09.880
 Yes, so it's always at the end going to be connected

1:32:09.880 --> 1:32:12.600
 to the blockchain of physical reality.

1:32:12.600 --> 1:32:16.680
 So in the case of law and taxes, it's connected to government

1:32:17.240 --> 1:32:20.680
 and government is what violence is the,

1:32:21.480 --> 1:32:25.000
 I'm playing with stacks of devil's advocates here

1:32:27.720 --> 1:32:30.520
 and popping one devil off the stack at a time.

1:32:30.520 --> 1:32:31.560
 Isn't ultimately, of course,

1:32:31.560 --> 1:32:33.080
 it'll be connected to physical reality,

1:32:33.080 --> 1:32:35.560
 but just because people control the physical reality,

1:32:35.560 --> 1:32:36.600
 it doesn't mean the status.

1:32:36.600 --> 1:32:39.720
 I guess LeBron James in theory could make more money

1:32:39.720 --> 1:32:43.320
 than the owners of the teams in theory.

1:32:43.320 --> 1:32:44.920
 And to me, that's a virtual idea.

1:32:44.920 --> 1:32:47.320
 So somebody else constructed a game

1:32:47.320 --> 1:32:51.880
 and now you're playing in the virtual space of the game.

1:32:51.880 --> 1:32:55.480
 So it just feels like there could be games where status,

1:32:55.480 --> 1:32:59.640
 we build realities that give us meaning in the virtual space.

1:33:00.280 --> 1:33:02.840
 I can imagine such things being possible.

1:33:02.840 --> 1:33:04.440
 Oh yeah, okay, so I see what you're saying.

1:33:04.440 --> 1:33:05.560
 I think I see what you're saying there

1:33:05.560 --> 1:33:08.840
 with the idea there, I mean, we'll take the LeBron James side

1:33:08.840 --> 1:33:10.760
 and put in like some YouTube influencer.

1:33:10.760 --> 1:33:11.480
 Yes, sure.

1:33:11.480 --> 1:33:15.000
 So the YouTube influencer, it is status games,

1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:18.920
 but at a certain level, it precipitates into real dollars

1:33:18.920 --> 1:33:21.160
 and into like, well, you look at Mr. Beast, right?

1:33:21.160 --> 1:33:23.160
 He's like sending off half a million dollars

1:33:23.160 --> 1:33:24.440
 worth of fireworks or something, right?

1:33:24.440 --> 1:33:25.640
 Not a YouTube video.

1:33:25.640 --> 1:33:28.520
 And also like saving, like saving trees and so on.

1:33:28.520 --> 1:33:29.880
 Sure, right, trying to find a million trees

1:33:29.880 --> 1:33:30.920
 with Mark Rober or whatever it was.

1:33:30.920 --> 1:33:33.000
 Yeah, like it's not that those kinds of games

1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:34.520
 can't lead to real consequences.

1:33:34.520 --> 1:33:39.320
 It's that for the vast majority of people in consumer culture,

1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:44.360
 they are incented by the, I would say mostly,

1:33:44.360 --> 1:33:46.440
 I'm thinking about middle class consumers.

1:33:46.920 --> 1:33:48.760
 They're incented by advertisements,

1:33:48.760 --> 1:33:50.840
 they're scented by their memetic environment

1:33:50.840 --> 1:33:54.760
 to treat the purchasing of certain things,

1:33:54.760 --> 1:33:56.440
 the need to buy the latest model, whatever,

1:33:56.440 --> 1:33:58.280
 the need to appear, however,

1:33:58.280 --> 1:34:02.360
 the need to pursue status games as a driver of meaning.

1:34:02.360 --> 1:34:04.440
 And my point would be that it's a very hollow

1:34:04.440 --> 1:34:05.480
 driver of meaning.

1:34:05.960 --> 1:34:08.280
 And that is what creates a meaning crisis.

1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:10.040
 Because at the end of the day,

1:34:10.040 --> 1:34:12.120
 it's like eating a lot of empty calories, right?

1:34:12.120 --> 1:34:13.960
 Yeah, it tasted good going down, a lot of sugar,

1:34:13.960 --> 1:34:15.800
 but man, it did not, it was not enough protein

1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:17.080
 to help build your muscles.

1:34:17.080 --> 1:34:18.920
 And you kind of feel that in your gut.

1:34:18.920 --> 1:34:21.240
 And I think that's, I mean, so all this stuff aside

1:34:21.240 --> 1:34:22.840
 and setting aside our discussion on currency,

1:34:22.840 --> 1:34:24.360
 which I hope we get back to,

1:34:24.360 --> 1:34:27.480
 that's what I mean about the meaning crisis,

1:34:27.480 --> 1:34:30.120
 part of it being created by the fact that we don't,

1:34:30.120 --> 1:34:32.520
 we're not encouraged to have more and more

1:34:32.520 --> 1:34:34.200
 direct relationships.

1:34:34.200 --> 1:34:37.880
 We're actually alienated from relating to,

1:34:37.880 --> 1:34:40.360
 even our family members sometimes, right?

1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:43.880
 We're encouraged to relate to brands.

1:34:43.880 --> 1:34:46.280
 We're encouraged to relate to these kinds of things

1:34:46.280 --> 1:34:49.240
 that then tell us to do things

1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:51.240
 that are really of low consequence.

1:34:51.240 --> 1:34:52.920
 And that's where the meaning crisis comes from.

1:34:52.920 --> 1:34:54.760
 So the role of technology in this,

1:34:54.760 --> 1:34:57.240
 so there's somebody you mentioned who's Jacques,

1:34:57.240 --> 1:35:01.400
 his view of technology, he warns about the towering piles

1:35:01.400 --> 1:35:05.400
 of technique, which I guess is a broad idea of technology.

1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:08.120
 So I think, correct me if I'm wrong for him,

1:35:08.120 --> 1:35:12.440
 technology is bad at moving away from human nature

1:35:12.440 --> 1:35:14.680
 and it's ultimately is destructive.

1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:16.920
 My question, broadly speaking, this meaning crisis,

1:35:16.920 --> 1:35:19.640
 can technology, what are the pros and cons of technology?

1:35:19.640 --> 1:35:21.000
 Can it be a good?

1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:22.280
 Yeah, I think it can be.

1:35:22.280 --> 1:35:24.600
 I certainly think it can be a good thing.

1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:27.240
 Can it be a good? Yeah, I think it can be.

1:35:27.240 --> 1:35:29.720
 I certainly draw on some of Alol's ideas

1:35:29.720 --> 1:35:32.920
 and I think some of them are pretty good.

1:35:32.920 --> 1:35:36.200
 But the way he defines technique is,

1:35:36.200 --> 1:35:37.720
 well, also Simondon as well.

1:35:37.720 --> 1:35:41.240
 I mean, he speaks to the general mentality of efficiency,

1:35:41.240 --> 1:35:43.640
 homogenized processes, homogenized production,

1:35:43.640 --> 1:35:47.160
 homogenized labor to produce homogenized artifacts

1:35:47.160 --> 1:35:49.400
 that then are not actually,

1:35:50.920 --> 1:35:53.080
 they don't sit well in the environment.

1:35:53.080 --> 1:35:57.880
 Essentially, you can think of it as the antonym of craft.

1:35:57.880 --> 1:36:02.040
 Whereas a craftsman will come to a problem,

1:36:02.040 --> 1:36:04.280
 maybe a piece of wood and they make into a chair.

1:36:04.280 --> 1:36:06.600
 It may be a site to build a house or build a stable

1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:08.520
 or build whatever.

1:36:08.520 --> 1:36:12.280
 And they will consider how to bring various things in

1:36:12.280 --> 1:36:15.080
 to build something well contextualized

1:36:15.080 --> 1:36:20.080
 that's in right relationship with that environment.

1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:22.360
 But the way we have driven technology

1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:25.720
 over the last 100 and 150 years is not that at all.

1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:30.480
 It is how can we make sure the input materials

1:36:30.480 --> 1:36:33.400
 are homogenized, cut to the same size,

1:36:33.400 --> 1:36:36.840
 diluted and doped to exactly the right alloy concentrations.

1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:38.680
 How do we create machines that then consume exactly

1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:39.960
 the right kind of energy to be able to run

1:36:39.960 --> 1:36:42.600
 at this high speed to stamp out the same parts,

1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:44.080
 which then go out the door,

1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:45.760
 everyone gets the same tickle of Mielmo.

1:36:45.760 --> 1:36:46.800
 And the reason why everyone wants it

1:36:46.800 --> 1:36:49.280
 is because we have broadcasts that tells everyone

1:36:49.280 --> 1:36:50.520
 this is the cool thing.

1:36:50.520 --> 1:36:52.560
 So we homogenize demand, right?

1:36:52.560 --> 1:36:55.440
 And we're like Baudrillard and other critiques

1:36:55.440 --> 1:36:57.520
 of modernity coming from that direction,

1:36:57.520 --> 1:36:59.240
 the situation lists as well.

1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:02.080
 It's that their point is that at this point in time,

1:37:02.080 --> 1:37:04.560
 consumption is the thing that drives

1:37:04.560 --> 1:37:06.680
 a lot of the economic stuff, not the need,

1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:09.400
 but the need to consume and build status games on top.

1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:12.120
 So we have homogenized, when we discovered,

1:37:12.120 --> 1:37:14.800
 I think this is really like Bernays and stuff, right?

1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:17.920
 In the early 20th century, we discovered we can create,

1:37:17.920 --> 1:37:20.880
 we can create demand, we can create desire

1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:23.560
 in a way that was not possible before

1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:25.560
 because of broadcast media.

1:37:25.560 --> 1:37:27.680
 And not only do we create desire,

1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:29.360
 we don't create a desire for each person

1:37:29.360 --> 1:37:31.080
 to connect to some bespoke thing,

1:37:31.080 --> 1:37:33.640
 to build a relationship with their neighbor or their spouse.

1:37:33.640 --> 1:37:36.080
 We are telling them, you need to consume this brand,

1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:37.200
 you need to drive this vehicle,

1:37:37.200 --> 1:37:38.320
 you gotta listen to this music,

1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:40.920
 have you heard this, have you seen this movie, right?

1:37:40.920 --> 1:37:44.800
 So creating homogenized demand makes it really cheap

1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:46.520
 to create homogenized product.

1:37:46.520 --> 1:37:48.520
 And now you have economics of scale.

1:37:48.520 --> 1:37:50.000
 So we make the same tickle me Elmo,

1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.800
 give it to all the kids and all the kids are like,

1:37:52.800 --> 1:37:54.400
 hey, I got a tickle me Elmo, right?

1:37:54.400 --> 1:37:58.640
 So this is ultimately where this ties in then

1:37:58.640 --> 1:38:03.040
 to runaway hypercapitalism is that we then,

1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:04.800
 capitalism is always looking for growth.

1:38:04.800 --> 1:38:05.960
 It's always looking for growth

1:38:05.960 --> 1:38:07.960
 and growth only happens at the margins.

1:38:07.960 --> 1:38:09.960
 So you have to squeeze more and more demand out.

1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:11.040
 You gotta make it cheaper and cheaper

1:38:11.040 --> 1:38:12.280
 to make the same thing,

1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:15.080
 but tell everyone they're still getting meaning from it.

1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:18.040
 You're still like, this is still your tickle me Elmo, right?

1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:21.400
 And we see little bits of this dripping critiques

1:38:21.400 --> 1:38:22.800
 of this dripping in popular culture.

1:38:22.800 --> 1:38:25.920
 You see it sometimes it's when Buzz Lightyear

1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:27.760
 walks into the thing, he's like,

1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:30.640
 oh my God, at the toy store, I'm just a toy.

1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:31.760
 Like there's millions of other,

1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:33.400
 or there's hundreds of other Buzz Lightyear's

1:38:33.400 --> 1:38:34.720
 just like me, right?

1:38:34.720 --> 1:38:38.080
 That is, I think, a fun Pixar critique

1:38:38.080 --> 1:38:40.080
 on this homogenization dynamic.

1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:42.880
 I agree with you on most of the things you're saying.

1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:44.560
 So I'm playing devil's advocate here,

1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:49.560
 but this homogenized machine of capitalism

1:38:50.600 --> 1:38:54.240
 is also the thing that is able to fund,

1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:59.120
 if channeled correctly, innovation, invention,

1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:00.760
 and development of totally new things

1:39:00.760 --> 1:39:02.280
 that in the best possible world,

1:39:02.280 --> 1:39:05.600
 create all kinds of new experiences that can enrich lives,

1:39:06.680 --> 1:39:09.840
 the quality of lives for all kinds of people.

1:39:09.840 --> 1:39:12.360
 So isn't this the machine

1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:15.120
 that actually enables the experiences

1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:18.640
 and more and more experiences that will then give meaning?

1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:21.040
 It has done that to some extent.

1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:24.680
 I mean, it's not all good or bad in my perspective.

1:39:24.680 --> 1:39:26.760
 We can always look backwards

1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:29.120
 and offer a critique of the path we've taken

1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:30.640
 to get to this point in time.

1:39:31.640 --> 1:39:33.760
 But that's a different, that's somewhat different

1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:35.880
 and informs the discussion,

1:39:35.880 --> 1:39:37.680
 but it's somewhat different than the question

1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:40.600
 of where do we go in the future, right?

1:39:40.600 --> 1:39:42.720
 Is this still the same rocket we need to ride

1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:43.560
 to get to the next point?

1:39:43.560 --> 1:39:44.560
 Will it even get us to the next point?

1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:46.240
 Well, how does this, so you're predicting the future,

1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:48.760
 how does it go wrong in your view?

1:39:48.760 --> 1:39:51.040
 We have the mechanisms,

1:39:51.040 --> 1:39:53.920
 we have now explored enough technologies

1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:57.760
 to where we can actually, I think, sustainably produce

1:39:59.520 --> 1:40:02.360
 what most people in the world need to live.

1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:07.640
 We have also created the infrastructures

1:40:07.640 --> 1:40:10.400
 to allow continued research and development

1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:13.040
 of additional science and medicine

1:40:13.040 --> 1:40:14.680
 and various other kinds of things.

1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:18.520
 The organizing principles that we use

1:40:18.520 --> 1:40:21.840
 to govern all these things today have been,

1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:25.520
 a lot of them have been just inherited

1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:28.440
 from honestly medieval times.

1:40:28.440 --> 1:40:30.160
 Some of them have refactored a little bit

1:40:30.160 --> 1:40:31.920
 in the industrial era,

1:40:31.920 --> 1:40:35.920
 but a lot of these modes of organizing people

1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:38.280
 are deeply problematic.

1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:41.640
 And furthermore, they're rooted in,

1:40:41.640 --> 1:40:46.160
 I think, a very industrial mode perspective on human labor.

1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:47.800
 And this is one of those things,

1:40:47.800 --> 1:40:49.720
 I'm gonna go back to the open source thing.

1:40:49.720 --> 1:40:51.920
 There was a point in time when,

1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:53.640
 well, let me ask you this.

1:40:53.640 --> 1:40:57.080
 If you look at the core SciPy sort of collection of libraries,

1:40:57.080 --> 1:40:59.360
 so SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, right?

1:40:59.360 --> 1:41:01.440
 There's iPython Notebook, let's throw pandas in there,

1:41:01.440 --> 1:41:03.400
 scikit learn, a few of these things.

1:41:03.400 --> 1:41:07.400
 How much value do you think, economic value,

1:41:07.400 --> 1:41:09.400
 would you say they drive in the world today?

1:41:10.800 --> 1:41:12.640
 That's one of the fascinating things

1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:14.600
 about talking to you and Travis is like,

1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.160
 it's a measure, it's like a...

1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:20.080
 At least a billion dollars a day, maybe?

1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:21.240
 A billion dollars, sure.

1:41:21.240 --> 1:41:23.680
 I mean, it's like, it's similar question of like,

1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:26.080
 how much value does Wikipedia create?

1:41:26.080 --> 1:41:26.920
 Right.

1:41:26.920 --> 1:41:30.520
 It's like, all of it, I don't know.

1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:31.840
 Well, I mean, if you look at it,

1:41:31.840 --> 1:41:33.440
 all of it, I don't know.

1:41:33.440 --> 1:41:34.720
 Well, I mean, if you look at our systems,

1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:36.120
 when you do a Google search, right?

1:41:36.120 --> 1:41:37.760
 Now, some of that stuff runs through TensorFlow,

1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:40.080
 but when you look at Siri,

1:41:40.080 --> 1:41:42.080
 when you do credit card transaction fraud,

1:41:42.080 --> 1:41:43.360
 like just everything, right?

1:41:43.360 --> 1:41:45.240
 Every intelligence agency under the sun,

1:41:45.240 --> 1:41:47.680
 they're using some aspect of these kinds of tools.

1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:51.200
 So I would say that these create billions of dollars

1:41:51.200 --> 1:41:52.040
 of value.

1:41:52.040 --> 1:41:53.560
 Oh, you mean like direct use of tools

1:41:53.560 --> 1:41:54.400
 that leverage this data?

1:41:54.400 --> 1:41:55.240
 Yes, direct, yeah.

1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:56.720
 Yeah, even that's billions a day, yeah.

1:41:56.720 --> 1:41:58.800
 Yeah, right, easily, I think.

1:41:58.800 --> 1:41:59.800
 Like the things they could not do

1:41:59.800 --> 1:42:01.160
 if they didn't have these tools, right?

1:42:01.160 --> 1:42:02.000
 Yes.

1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.880
 So that's billions of dollars a day, great.

1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:05.760
 I think that's about right.

1:42:05.760 --> 1:42:07.880
 Now, if we take, how many people did it take

1:42:07.880 --> 1:42:09.960
 to make that, right?

1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:11.720
 And there was a point in time, not anymore,

1:42:11.720 --> 1:42:12.960
 but there was a point in time when they could fit

1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:13.800
 in a van.

1:42:13.800 --> 1:42:15.960
 I could have fit them in my Mercedes winter, right?

1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:19.240
 And so if you look at that, like, holy crap,

1:42:19.240 --> 1:42:22.480
 literally a van of maybe a dozen people

1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:27.480
 could create value to the tune of billions of dollars a day.

1:42:28.320 --> 1:42:30.080
 What lesson do you draw from that?

1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:31.400
 Well, here's the thing.

1:42:31.400 --> 1:42:34.240
 What can we do to do more of that?

1:42:35.240 --> 1:42:36.360
 Like that's open source.

1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:39.760
 The way I've talked about this in other environments is

1:42:39.760 --> 1:42:43.440
 when we use generative participatory crowdsourced

1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:47.600
 approaches, we unlock human potential

1:42:47.600 --> 1:42:50.840
 at a level that is better than what capitalism can do.

1:42:52.280 --> 1:42:55.520
 I would challenge anyone to go and try to hire

1:42:55.520 --> 1:42:58.360
 the right 12 people in the world

1:42:58.360 --> 1:43:00.240
 to build that entire stack

1:43:00.240 --> 1:43:02.520
 the way those 12 people did that, right?

1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:04.160
 They would be very, very hard pressed to do that.

1:43:04.160 --> 1:43:06.760
 If a hedge fund could just hire a dozen people

1:43:06.760 --> 1:43:08.480
 and create like something that is worth

1:43:08.480 --> 1:43:10.120
 billions of dollars a day,

1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:12.400
 every single one of them would be racing to do it, right?

1:43:12.400 --> 1:43:13.680
 But finding the right people,

1:43:13.680 --> 1:43:15.160
 fostering the right collaborations,

1:43:15.160 --> 1:43:16.840
 getting it adopted by the right other people

1:43:16.840 --> 1:43:18.080
 to then refine it,

1:43:18.080 --> 1:43:21.080
 that is a thing that was organic in nature.

1:43:21.080 --> 1:43:22.200
 That took crowdsourcing.

1:43:22.200 --> 1:43:24.160
 That took a lot of the open source ethos

1:43:24.160 --> 1:43:26.480
 and it took the right kinds of people, right?

1:43:26.480 --> 1:43:27.880
 Now those people who started that said,

1:43:27.880 --> 1:43:30.880
 I need to have a part of a multi billion dollar a day

1:43:30.880 --> 1:43:32.440
 sort of enterprise.

1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:33.560
 They're like, I'm doing this cool thing

1:43:33.560 --> 1:43:35.480
 to solve my problem for my friends, right?

1:43:35.480 --> 1:43:37.880
 So the point of telling the story

1:43:37.880 --> 1:43:40.760
 is to say that our way of thinking about value,

1:43:40.760 --> 1:43:42.880
 our way of thinking about allocation of resources,

1:43:42.880 --> 1:43:44.920
 our ways of thinking about property rights

1:43:44.920 --> 1:43:46.200
 and all these kinds of things,

1:43:46.200 --> 1:43:50.040
 they come from finite game, scarcity mentality,

1:43:50.040 --> 1:43:52.160
 medieval institutions.

1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:54.200
 As we are now entering,

1:43:54.200 --> 1:43:57.080
 to some extent we're sort of in a post scarcity era,

1:43:57.080 --> 1:43:59.800
 although some people are hoarding a whole lot of stuff.

1:43:59.800 --> 1:44:02.200
 We are at a point where if not now soon,

1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:03.920
 we'll be in a post scarcity era.

1:44:03.920 --> 1:44:06.480
 The question of how we allocate resources

1:44:06.480 --> 1:44:08.720
 has to be revisited at a fundamental level

1:44:08.720 --> 1:44:11.000
 because the kind of software these people built,

1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:13.960
 the modalities that those human ecologies

1:44:13.960 --> 1:44:15.840
 that built that software,

1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:17.960
 it treats offers unproperty.

1:44:17.960 --> 1:44:20.480
 Actually sharing creates value.

1:44:20.480 --> 1:44:23.080
 Restricting and forking reduces value.

1:44:23.080 --> 1:44:26.360
 So that's different than any other physical resource

1:44:26.360 --> 1:44:27.200
 that we've ever dealt with.

1:44:27.200 --> 1:44:28.720
 It's different than how most corporations

1:44:28.720 --> 1:44:31.240
 treat software IP, right?

1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:34.600
 So if treating software in this way

1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:37.560
 created this much value so efficiently, so cheaply,

1:44:37.560 --> 1:44:39.160
 because feeding a dozen people for 10 years

1:44:39.160 --> 1:44:41.640
 is really cheap, right?

1:44:41.640 --> 1:44:44.680
 That's the reason I care about this right now

1:44:44.680 --> 1:44:46.040
 is because looking forward

1:44:46.040 --> 1:44:48.000
 when we can automate a lot of labor,

1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:49.560
 where we can in fact,

1:44:49.560 --> 1:44:52.200
 the programming for your robot in your part,

1:44:52.200 --> 1:44:54.120
 neck of the woods and your part of the Amazon

1:44:54.120 --> 1:44:55.960
 to build something sustainable for you

1:44:55.960 --> 1:44:58.200
 and your tribe to deliver the right medicines,

1:44:58.200 --> 1:45:00.240
 to take care of the kids,

1:45:00.240 --> 1:45:02.880
 that's just software, that's just code

1:45:02.880 --> 1:45:05.480
 that could be totally open sourced, right?

1:45:05.480 --> 1:45:07.360
 So we can actually get to a mode

1:45:07.360 --> 1:45:10.920
 where all of this additional generative things

1:45:10.920 --> 1:45:12.400
 that humans are doing,

1:45:12.400 --> 1:45:16.200
 they don't have to be wrapped up in a container

1:45:16.200 --> 1:45:18.360
 and then we charge for all the exponential dynamics

1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:19.200
 out of it.

1:45:19.200 --> 1:45:20.400
 That's what Facebook did.

1:45:20.400 --> 1:45:22.400
 That's what modern social media did, right?

1:45:22.400 --> 1:45:24.920
 Because the old internet was connecting people just fine.

1:45:24.920 --> 1:45:25.960
 So Facebook came along and said,

1:45:25.960 --> 1:45:26.960
 well, anyone can post a picture,

1:45:26.960 --> 1:45:28.440
 anyone can post some text

1:45:28.440 --> 1:45:31.120
 and we're gonna amplify the crap out of it to everyone else.

1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:33.280
 And it exploded this generative network

1:45:33.280 --> 1:45:34.720
 of human interaction.

1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:36.080
 And then I said, how do I make money off that?

1:45:36.080 --> 1:45:38.160
 Oh yeah, I'm gonna be a gatekeeper

1:45:38.160 --> 1:45:39.880
 on everybody's attention.

1:45:39.880 --> 1:45:41.040
 And that's how I'm gonna make money.

1:45:41.040 --> 1:45:45.640
 So how do we create more than one van?

1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:47.840
 How do we have millions of vans full of people

1:45:47.840 --> 1:45:51.000
 that create NumPy, SciPy, that create Python?

1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:55.120
 So the story of those people is often they have

1:45:55.120 --> 1:45:57.080
 some kind of job outside of this.

1:45:57.080 --> 1:45:58.880
 This is what they're doing for fun.

1:45:58.880 --> 1:46:00.960
 Don't you need to have a job?

1:46:00.960 --> 1:46:02.240
 Don't you have to be connected,

1:46:02.240 --> 1:46:04.960
 plugged in to the capitalist system?

1:46:04.960 --> 1:46:05.800
 Isn't that what,

1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:09.160
 isn't this consumerism,

1:46:09.160 --> 1:46:13.880
 the engine that results in the individuals

1:46:13.880 --> 1:46:15.880
 that kind of take a break from it every once in a while

1:46:15.880 --> 1:46:17.320
 to create something magical?

1:46:17.320 --> 1:46:19.160
 Like at the edges is where the innovation happens.

1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:21.360
 There's a surplus, right, this is the question.

1:46:21.360 --> 1:46:24.400
 Like if everyone were to go and run their own farm,

1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:27.320
 no one would have time to go and write NumPy, SciPy, right?

1:46:27.320 --> 1:46:29.960
 Maybe, but that's what I'm talking about

1:46:29.960 --> 1:46:32.800
 when I say we're maybe at a post scarcity point

1:46:32.800 --> 1:46:34.160
 for a lot of people.

1:46:34.160 --> 1:46:37.240
 The question that we're never encouraged to ask

1:46:37.240 --> 1:46:40.640
 in a Super Bowl ad is how much do you need?

1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:41.960
 How much is enough?

1:46:41.960 --> 1:46:45.040
 Do you need to have a new car every two years, every five?

1:46:45.040 --> 1:46:46.160
 If you have a reliable car,

1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:48.480
 can you drive one for 10 years, is that all right?

1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:50.520
 I had a car for 10 years and it was fine.

1:46:50.520 --> 1:46:52.800
 Your iPhone, do you have to upgrade every two years?

1:46:52.800 --> 1:46:54.320
 I mean, it's sort of, you're using the same apps

1:46:54.320 --> 1:46:56.680
 you did four years ago, right?

1:46:56.680 --> 1:46:58.320
 This should be a Super Bowl ad.

1:46:58.320 --> 1:46:59.680
 This should be a Super Bowl ad, that's great.

1:46:59.680 --> 1:47:01.400
 Maybe somebody. Do you really need a new iPhone?

1:47:01.400 --> 1:47:03.920
 Maybe one of our listeners will fund something like this

1:47:03.920 --> 1:47:06.960
 of like, no, but just actually bringing it back,

1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:09.440
 bringing it back to actually the question

1:47:09.440 --> 1:47:11.480
 of what do you need?

1:47:11.480 --> 1:47:13.560
 How do we create the infrastructure

1:47:13.560 --> 1:47:17.640
 for collectives of people to live on the basis

1:47:17.640 --> 1:47:21.000
 of providing what we need, meeting people's needs

1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:23.200
 with a little bit of access to handle emergencies,

1:47:23.200 --> 1:47:26.320
 things like that, pulling our resources together

1:47:26.320 --> 1:47:28.760
 to handle the really, really big emergencies,

1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:30.880
 somebody with a really rare form of cancer

1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:34.120
 or some massive fire sweeps through half the village

1:47:34.120 --> 1:47:38.200
 or whatever, but can we actually unscale things

1:47:38.200 --> 1:47:41.560
 and solve for people's needs

1:47:41.560 --> 1:47:45.160
 and then give them the capacity to explore

1:47:45.160 --> 1:47:47.320
 how to be the best version of themselves?

1:47:47.320 --> 1:47:51.000
 And for Travis, that was throwing away his shot of tenure

1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:52.880
 in order to write NumPy.

1:47:52.880 --> 1:47:56.840
 For others, there is a saying in the SciFi community

1:47:56.840 --> 1:47:59.800
 that SciFi advances one failed postdoc at a time.

1:48:00.920 --> 1:48:03.800
 And that's, we can do these things.

1:48:03.800 --> 1:48:05.600
 We can actually do this kind of collaboration

1:48:05.600 --> 1:48:08.360
 because code, software, information, organization,

1:48:08.360 --> 1:48:09.880
 that's cheap.

1:48:09.880 --> 1:48:13.000
 Those bits are very cheap to fling across the oceans.

1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:14.760
 So you mentioned Travis.

1:48:14.760 --> 1:48:16.560
 We've been talking and we'll continue to talk

1:48:16.560 --> 1:48:17.720
 about open source.

1:48:19.480 --> 1:48:20.440
 Maybe you can comment.

1:48:20.440 --> 1:48:21.960
 How did you meet Travis?

1:48:21.960 --> 1:48:24.080
 Who is Travis Aliphant?

1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:27.400
 What's your relationship been like through the years?

1:48:28.440 --> 1:48:30.160
 Where did you work together?

1:48:30.160 --> 1:48:31.800
 How did you meet?

1:48:31.800 --> 1:48:35.120
 What's the present and the future look like?

1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:36.600
 Yeah, so the first time I met Travis

1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:39.360
 was at a SciFi conference in Pasadena.

1:48:39.360 --> 1:48:40.920
 Do you remember the year?

1:48:40.920 --> 1:48:42.040
 2005.

1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:44.400
 I was working at, again, at nthought,

1:48:44.400 --> 1:48:47.000
 working on scientific computing consulting.

1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:51.160
 And a couple of years later,

1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:54.040
 he joined us at nthought, I think 2007.

1:48:55.240 --> 1:48:58.240
 And he came in as the president.

1:48:58.240 --> 1:49:01.880
 One of the founders of nthought was the CEO, Eric Jones.

1:49:01.880 --> 1:49:04.080
 And we were all very excited that Travis was joining us

1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:05.080
 and that was great fun.

1:49:05.080 --> 1:49:06.960
 And so I worked with Travis

1:49:06.960 --> 1:49:08.920
 on a number of consulting projects

1:49:08.920 --> 1:49:12.120
 and we worked on some open source stuff.

1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:15.080
 I mean, it was just a really, it was a good time there.

1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:15.920
 And then...

1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:17.840
 It was primarily Python related?

1:49:17.840 --> 1:49:19.800
 Oh yeah, it was all Python, NumPy, SciFi consulting

1:49:19.800 --> 1:49:21.000
 kind of stuff.

1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.240
 Towards the end of that time,

1:49:23.240 --> 1:49:27.720
 we started getting called into more and more finance shops.

1:49:27.720 --> 1:49:29.840
 They were adopting Python pretty heavily.

1:49:29.840 --> 1:49:33.320
 I did some work on like a high frequency trading shop,

1:49:33.320 --> 1:49:34.160
 working on some stuff.

1:49:34.160 --> 1:49:36.520
 And then we worked together on some,

1:49:36.520 --> 1:49:39.840
 at a couple of investment banks in Manhattan.

1:49:39.840 --> 1:49:42.680
 And so we started seeing that there was a potential

1:49:42.680 --> 1:49:45.720
 to take Python in the direction of business computing,

1:49:45.720 --> 1:49:48.120
 more than just being this niche like MATLAB replacement

1:49:48.120 --> 1:49:50.520
 for big vector computing.

1:49:50.520 --> 1:49:51.800
 What we were seeing was, oh yeah,

1:49:51.800 --> 1:49:53.880
 you could actually use Python as a Swiss army knife

1:49:53.880 --> 1:49:56.840
 to do a lot of shadow data transformation kind of stuff.

1:49:56.840 --> 1:50:00.520
 So that's when we realized the potential is much greater.

1:50:00.520 --> 1:50:03.360
 And so we started Anaconda,

1:50:03.360 --> 1:50:05.240
 I mean, it was called Continuum Analytics at the time,

1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:07.520
 but we started in January of 2012

1:50:07.520 --> 1:50:10.760
 with a vision of shoring up the parts of Python

1:50:10.760 --> 1:50:13.760
 that needed to get expanded to handle data at scale,

1:50:13.760 --> 1:50:17.200
 to do web visualization, application development, et cetera.

1:50:17.200 --> 1:50:18.040
 And that was that, yeah.

1:50:18.040 --> 1:50:23.040
 So he was CEO and I was president for the first five years.

1:50:23.880 --> 1:50:27.480
 And then we raised some money and then the board,

1:50:27.480 --> 1:50:28.960
 it was sort of put in a new CEO.

1:50:28.960 --> 1:50:31.320
 They hired a kind of professional CEO.

1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:34.080
 And then Travis, you laugh at that.

1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:35.240
 I took over the CTO role.

1:50:35.240 --> 1:50:37.920
 Travis then left after a year to do his own thing,

1:50:37.920 --> 1:50:41.120
 to do Quonsight, which was more oriented

1:50:41.120 --> 1:50:43.920
 around some of the bootstrap years that we did at Continuum

1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:46.200
 where it was open source and consulting.

1:50:46.200 --> 1:50:48.600
 It wasn't sort of like gung ho product development.

1:50:48.600 --> 1:50:50.120
 And it wasn't focused on,

1:50:50.120 --> 1:50:51.120
 we accidentally stumbled

1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:55.560
 into the package management problem at Anaconda,

1:50:55.560 --> 1:50:57.760
 but we had a lot of other visions of other technology

1:50:57.760 --> 1:50:58.920
 that we built in the open source.

1:50:58.920 --> 1:51:02.080
 And Travis was really trying to push,

1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:04.160
 again, the frontiers of numerical computing,

1:51:04.160 --> 1:51:05.320
 vector computing,

1:51:05.320 --> 1:51:07.720
 handling things like auto differentiation and stuff

1:51:07.720 --> 1:51:09.960
 intrinsically in the open ecosystem.

1:51:09.960 --> 1:51:14.320
 So I think that's kind of the direction

1:51:14.320 --> 1:51:18.280
 he's working on in some of his work.

1:51:18.280 --> 1:51:22.520
 We remain great friends and colleagues and collaborators,

1:51:22.520 --> 1:51:25.760
 even though he's no longer day to day working at Anaconda,

1:51:25.760 --> 1:51:27.000
 but he gives me a lot of feedback

1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:29.000
 about this and that and the other.

1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:32.200
 What's a big lesson you've learned from Travis

1:51:32.200 --> 1:51:35.440
 about life or about programming or about leadership?

1:51:35.440 --> 1:51:36.480
 Wow, there's a lot.

1:51:36.480 --> 1:51:37.320
 There's a lot.

1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:39.600
 Travis is a really, really good guy.

1:51:39.600 --> 1:51:41.920
 He really, his heart is really in it.

1:51:41.920 --> 1:51:43.080
 He cares a lot.

1:51:44.760 --> 1:51:46.920
 I've gotten that sense having to interact with him.

1:51:46.920 --> 1:51:47.760
 It's so interesting.

1:51:47.760 --> 1:51:48.600
 Such a good human being.

1:51:48.600 --> 1:51:49.720
 He's a really good dude.

1:51:49.720 --> 1:51:51.360
 And he and I, it's so interesting.

1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:53.240
 We come from very different backgrounds.

1:51:53.240 --> 1:51:54.920
 We're quite different as people,

1:51:56.000 --> 1:52:00.800
 but I think we can like not talk for a long time

1:52:00.800 --> 1:52:03.280
 and then be on a conversation

1:52:03.280 --> 1:52:06.400
 and be eye to eye on like 90% of things.

1:52:06.400 --> 1:52:08.280
 And so he's someone who I believe

1:52:08.280 --> 1:52:10.600
 no matter how much fog settles in over the ocean,

1:52:10.600 --> 1:52:12.200
 his ship, my ship are pointed

1:52:12.200 --> 1:52:14.120
 sort of in the same direction of the same star.

1:52:14.120 --> 1:52:16.840
 Wow, that's a beautiful way to phrase it.

1:52:16.840 --> 1:52:18.600
 No matter how much fog there is,

1:52:18.600 --> 1:52:20.400
 we're pointed at the same star.

1:52:20.400 --> 1:52:21.880
 Yeah, and I hope he feels the same way.

1:52:21.880 --> 1:52:23.760
 I mean, I hope he knows that over the years now.

1:52:23.760 --> 1:52:27.000
 We both care a lot about the community.

1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:28.120
 For someone who cares so deeply,

1:52:28.120 --> 1:52:29.880
 I would say this about Travis that's interesting.

1:52:29.880 --> 1:52:33.360
 For someone who cares so deeply about the nerd details

1:52:33.360 --> 1:52:36.000
 of like type system design and vector computing

1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:38.760
 and efficiency of expressing this and that and the other,

1:52:38.760 --> 1:52:40.440
 memory layouts and all that stuff,

1:52:40.440 --> 1:52:43.280
 he cares even more about the people

1:52:43.280 --> 1:52:45.880
 in the ecosystem, the community.

1:52:45.880 --> 1:52:49.760
 And I have a similar kind of alignment.

1:52:49.760 --> 1:52:53.080
 I care a lot about the tech, I really do.

1:52:53.080 --> 1:52:58.080
 But for me, the beauty of what this human ecology

1:52:58.080 --> 1:53:01.680
 has produced is I think a touchstone.

1:53:01.680 --> 1:53:03.600
 It's an early version, we can look at it and say,

1:53:03.600 --> 1:53:05.800
 how do we replicate this for humanity at scale?

1:53:05.800 --> 1:53:08.760
 What this open source collaboration was able to produce?

1:53:08.760 --> 1:53:11.600
 How can we be generative in human collaboration

1:53:11.600 --> 1:53:12.760
 moving forward and create that

1:53:12.760 --> 1:53:15.080
 as a civilizational kind of dynamic?

1:53:15.080 --> 1:53:17.440
 Like, can we seize this moment to do that?

1:53:17.440 --> 1:53:19.720
 Because like a lot of the other open source movements,

1:53:19.720 --> 1:53:21.960
 it's all nerds nerding out on code for nerds.

1:53:23.600 --> 1:53:25.840
 And this because it's scientists,

1:53:25.840 --> 1:53:27.160
 because it's people working on data,

1:53:27.160 --> 1:53:30.080
 that all of it faces real human problems.

1:53:31.480 --> 1:53:32.600
 I think we have an opportunity

1:53:32.600 --> 1:53:34.360
 to actually make a bigger impact.

1:53:34.360 --> 1:53:37.480
 Is there a way for this kind of open source vision

1:53:37.480 --> 1:53:39.040
 to make money?

1:53:39.040 --> 1:53:40.080
 Absolutely.

1:53:40.080 --> 1:53:41.640
 To fund the people involved?

1:53:41.640 --> 1:53:43.040
 Is that an essential part of it?

1:53:43.040 --> 1:53:45.640
 It's hard, but we're trying to do that

1:53:45.640 --> 1:53:48.560
 in our own way at Anaconda,

1:53:48.560 --> 1:53:49.880
 because we know that business users,

1:53:49.880 --> 1:53:52.000
 as they use more of the stuff, they have needs,

1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:54.840
 like business specific needs around security, provenance.

1:53:54.840 --> 1:53:59.200
 They really can't tell their VPs and their investors,

1:53:59.200 --> 1:54:01.040
 hey, we're having, our data scientists

1:54:01.040 --> 1:54:03.520
 are installing random packages from who knows where

1:54:03.520 --> 1:54:04.680
 and running on customer data.

1:54:04.680 --> 1:54:05.920
 So they have to have someone to talk to you.

1:54:05.920 --> 1:54:07.360
 And that's what Anaconda does.

1:54:07.360 --> 1:54:10.400
 So we are a governed source of packages for them,

1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:12.160
 and that's great, that makes some money.

1:54:12.160 --> 1:54:16.160
 We take some of that and we just take that as a dividend.

1:54:16.160 --> 1:54:17.200
 We take a percentage of our revenues

1:54:17.200 --> 1:54:20.000
 and write that as a dividend for the open source community.

1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:23.440
 But beyond that, I really see the development

1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:27.560
 of a marketplace for people to create notebooks,

1:54:27.560 --> 1:54:30.840
 models, data sets, curation of these different kinds

1:54:30.840 --> 1:54:33.120
 of things, and to really have

1:54:33.120 --> 1:54:36.320
 a long tail marketplace dynamic with that.

1:54:37.280 --> 1:54:38.800
 Can you speak about this problem

1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:41.800
 that you stumbled into of package management,

1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:43.120
 Python package management?

1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:44.080
 What is that?

1:54:46.080 --> 1:54:48.160
 A lot of people speak very highly of Conda,

1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:50.720
 which is part of Anaconda, which is a package manager.

1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:52.400
 There's a ton of packages.

1:54:52.400 --> 1:54:55.080
 So first, what are package managers?

1:54:55.080 --> 1:54:57.240
 And second, what was there before?

1:54:57.240 --> 1:54:58.600
 What is pip?

1:54:58.600 --> 1:55:01.840
 And why is Conda more awesome?

1:55:01.840 --> 1:55:04.200
 The package problem is this, which is that

1:55:04.200 --> 1:55:09.200
 in order to do numerical computing efficiently with Python,

1:55:11.640 --> 1:55:14.480
 there are a lot of low level libraries

1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:17.400
 that need to be compiled, compiled with a C compiler

1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:19.880
 or C++ compiler or Fortran compiler.

1:55:19.880 --> 1:55:21.120
 They need to not just be compiled,

1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:23.680
 but they need to be compiled with all of the right settings.

1:55:23.680 --> 1:55:25.200
 And oftentimes those settings are tuned

1:55:25.200 --> 1:55:27.440
 for specific chip architectures.

1:55:27.440 --> 1:55:29.320
 And when you add GPUs to the mix,

1:55:29.320 --> 1:55:32.280
 when you look at different operating systems,

1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:33.800
 you may be on the same chip,

1:55:33.800 --> 1:55:37.200
 but if you're running Mac versus Linux versus Windows

1:55:37.200 --> 1:55:40.040
 on the same x86 chip, you compile and link differently.

1:55:40.040 --> 1:55:44.800
 All of this complexity is beyond the capability

1:55:44.800 --> 1:55:46.720
 of most data scientists to reason about.

1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:50.240
 And it's also beyond what most of the package developers

1:55:50.240 --> 1:55:51.880
 want to deal with too.

1:55:51.880 --> 1:55:52.840
 Because if you're a package developer,

1:55:52.840 --> 1:55:54.280
 you're like, I code on Linux.

1:55:54.280 --> 1:55:55.840
 This works for me, I'm good.

1:55:55.840 --> 1:55:58.080
 It is not my problem to figure out how to build this

1:55:58.080 --> 1:56:00.040
 on an ancient version of Windows, right?

1:56:00.040 --> 1:56:01.920
 That's just simply not my problem.

1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:05.120
 So what we end up with is we have a creator economy

1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:08.560
 or create a very creative crowdsourced environment

1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:11.160
 where people want to use this stuff, but they can't.

1:56:11.160 --> 1:56:15.720
 And so we ended up creating a new set of technologies

1:56:15.720 --> 1:56:18.400
 like a build recipe system, a build system

1:56:18.400 --> 1:56:21.480
 and an installer system that is able to,

1:56:22.520 --> 1:56:24.640
 well, to put it simply,

1:56:24.640 --> 1:56:27.680
 it's able to build these packages correctly

1:56:27.680 --> 1:56:29.320
 on each of these different kinds of platforms

1:56:29.320 --> 1:56:30.320
 and operating systems,

1:56:30.320 --> 1:56:33.040
 and make it so when people want to install something,

1:56:33.040 --> 1:56:34.400
 they can, it's just one command.

1:56:34.400 --> 1:56:36.960
 They don't have to set up a big compiler system

1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:38.320
 and do all these things.

1:56:38.320 --> 1:56:40.440
 So when it works well, it works great.

1:56:40.440 --> 1:56:43.920
 Now, the difficulty is we have literally thousands

1:56:43.920 --> 1:56:46.280
 of people writing code in the ecosystem,

1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:48.760
 building all sorts of stuff and each person writing code,

1:56:48.760 --> 1:56:50.640
 they may take a dependence on something else.

1:56:50.640 --> 1:56:52.280
 And so you have all this web,

1:56:52.280 --> 1:56:54.840
 incredibly complex web of dependencies.

1:56:54.840 --> 1:56:57.640
 So installing the correct package

1:56:57.640 --> 1:57:00.360
 for any given set of packages you want,

1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:04.600
 getting that right subgraph is an incredibly hard problem.

1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:05.800
 And again, most data scientists

1:57:05.800 --> 1:57:06.640
 don't want to think about this.

1:57:06.640 --> 1:57:09.160
 They're like, I want to install NumPy and pandas.

1:57:09.160 --> 1:57:11.720
 I want this version of some like geospatial library.

1:57:11.720 --> 1:57:13.080
 I want this other thing.

1:57:13.080 --> 1:57:14.000
 Like, why is this hard?

1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:15.680
 These exist, right?

1:57:15.680 --> 1:57:17.680
 And it is hard because it's, well,

1:57:17.680 --> 1:57:20.760
 you're installing this on a version of Windows, right?

1:57:20.760 --> 1:57:23.400
 And half of these libraries are not built for Windows

1:57:23.400 --> 1:57:25.120
 or the latest version isn't available,

1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:26.240
 but the old version was.

1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:27.560
 And if you go to the old version of this library,

1:57:27.560 --> 1:57:28.600
 that means you need to go to a different version

1:57:28.600 --> 1:57:30.040
 of that library.

1:57:30.040 --> 1:57:32.480
 And so the Python ecosystem,

1:57:32.480 --> 1:57:34.480
 by virtue of being crowdsourced,

1:57:34.480 --> 1:57:38.000
 we were able to fill a hundred thousand different niches.

1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.360
 But then we also suffer this problem

1:57:40.360 --> 1:57:43.120
 that because it's crowdsourced and no one,

1:57:43.120 --> 1:57:44.480
 it's like a tragedy of the commons, right?

1:57:44.480 --> 1:57:47.080
 No one really needs, wants to support

1:57:47.080 --> 1:57:49.200
 their thousands of other dependencies.

1:57:49.200 --> 1:57:52.160
 So we end up sort of having to do a lot of this.

1:57:52.160 --> 1:57:53.480
 And of course the conda forge community

1:57:53.480 --> 1:57:55.640
 also steps up as an open source community that,

1:57:55.640 --> 1:57:57.520
 you know, maintain some of these recipes.

1:57:57.520 --> 1:57:58.680
 That's what conda does.

1:57:58.680 --> 1:58:01.880
 Now, pip is a tool that came along after conda,

1:58:01.880 --> 1:58:04.480
 to some extent, it came along as an easier way

1:58:04.480 --> 1:58:09.480
 for the Python developers writing Python code

1:58:09.520 --> 1:58:12.920
 that didn't have as much compiled, you know, stuff.

1:58:12.920 --> 1:58:15.360
 They could then install different packages.

1:58:15.360 --> 1:58:17.800
 And what ended up happening in the Python ecosystem

1:58:17.800 --> 1:58:20.800
 was that a lot of the core Python and web Python developers,

1:58:20.800 --> 1:58:24.160
 they never ran into any of this compilation stuff at all.

1:58:24.160 --> 1:58:27.040
 So even we have, you know, on video,

1:58:27.040 --> 1:58:29.520
 we have Guido van Rossum saying,

1:58:29.520 --> 1:58:31.600
 you know what, the scientific community's packaging problems

1:58:31.600 --> 1:58:33.160
 are just too exotic and different.

1:58:33.160 --> 1:58:35.680
 I mean, you're talking about Fortran compilers, right?

1:58:35.680 --> 1:58:37.680
 Like you guys just need to build your own solution

1:58:37.680 --> 1:58:38.960
 perhaps, right?

1:58:38.960 --> 1:58:41.720
 So the Python core Python community went

1:58:41.720 --> 1:58:45.320
 and built its own sort of packaging technologies,

1:58:45.320 --> 1:58:47.880
 not really contemplating the complexity

1:58:47.880 --> 1:58:49.280
 of this stuff over here.

1:58:49.280 --> 1:58:51.560
 And so now we have the challenge where

1:58:51.560 --> 1:58:53.600
 you can pip install some things, some libraries,

1:58:53.600 --> 1:58:55.280
 if you just want to get started with them,

1:58:55.280 --> 1:58:57.560
 you can pip install TensorFlow and that works great.

1:58:57.560 --> 1:59:00.200
 The instant you want to also install some other packages

1:59:00.200 --> 1:59:02.560
 that use different versions of NumPy

1:59:02.560 --> 1:59:05.560
 or some like graphics library or some OpenCV thing

1:59:05.560 --> 1:59:08.720
 or some other thing, you now run into dependency hell

1:59:08.720 --> 1:59:09.880
 because you cannot, you know,

1:59:09.880 --> 1:59:12.800
 OpenCV can have a different version of libjpeg over here

1:59:12.800 --> 1:59:14.320
 than PyTorch over here.

1:59:14.320 --> 1:59:15.800
 Like they actually, they all have to use the,

1:59:15.800 --> 1:59:17.400
 if you want to use GPU acceleration,

1:59:17.400 --> 1:59:18.840
 they have to all use the same underlying drivers

1:59:18.840 --> 1:59:20.400
 and same GPU CUDA things.

1:59:20.400 --> 1:59:22.960
 So it's, it gets to be very gnarly

1:59:22.960 --> 1:59:24.240
 and it's a level of technology

1:59:24.240 --> 1:59:26.120
 that both the makers and the users

1:59:26.120 --> 1:59:28.560
 don't really want to think too much about.

1:59:28.560 --> 1:59:30.480
 And that's where you step in and try to solve this.

1:59:30.480 --> 1:59:31.320
 We try to solve it.

1:59:31.320 --> 1:59:32.160
 Subgraph problems.

1:59:32.160 --> 1:59:33.000
 How much is that?

1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:34.960
 I mean, you said that you don't want to think,

1:59:34.960 --> 1:59:35.960
 they don't want to think about it,

1:59:35.960 --> 1:59:38.000
 but how much is it a little bit on the developer

1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:42.440
 and providing them tools to be a little bit more clear

1:59:42.440 --> 1:59:44.920
 of that subgraph of dependency that's necessary?

1:59:44.920 --> 1:59:47.920
 It is getting to a point where we do have to think about,

1:59:47.920 --> 1:59:51.280
 look, can we pull some of the most popular packages together

1:59:51.280 --> 1:59:53.640
 and get them to work on a coordinated release timeline,

1:59:53.640 --> 1:59:55.880
 get them to build against the same test matrix,

1:59:55.880 --> 1:59:57.000
 et cetera, et cetera, right?

1:59:57.000 --> 1:59:58.780
 And there is a little bit of dynamic around this,

1:59:58.780 --> 2:00:01.880
 but again, it is a volunteer community.

2:00:01.880 --> 2:00:02.720
 Yeah.

2:00:02.720 --> 2:00:04.980
 You know, people working on these different projects

2:00:04.980 --> 2:00:06.040
 have their own timelines

2:00:06.040 --> 2:00:07.600
 and their own things they're trying to meet.

2:00:07.600 --> 2:00:11.360
 So we end up trying to pull these things together.

2:00:11.360 --> 2:00:13.080
 And then it's this incredibly,

2:00:13.080 --> 2:00:15.440
 and I would recommend just as a business tip,

2:00:15.440 --> 2:00:16.560
 don't ever go into business

2:00:16.560 --> 2:00:19.600
 where when your hard work works, you're invisible.

2:00:19.600 --> 2:00:21.720
 And when it breaks because of someone else's problem,

2:00:21.720 --> 2:00:23.200
 you get flagged for it.

2:00:23.200 --> 2:00:25.640
 Because that's in our situation, right?

2:00:25.640 --> 2:00:27.280
 When something doesn't condensate all properly,

2:00:27.280 --> 2:00:28.980
 usually it's some upstream issue,

2:00:28.980 --> 2:00:30.280
 but it looks like condensate is broken.

2:00:30.280 --> 2:00:32.640
 It looks like, you know, Anaconda screwed something up.

2:00:32.640 --> 2:00:34.560
 When things do work though, it's like, oh yeah, cool.

2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:35.400
 It's worked.

2:00:35.400 --> 2:00:36.240
 Assuming naturally, of course,

2:00:36.240 --> 2:00:38.200
 it's very easy to make that work, right?

2:00:38.200 --> 2:00:41.960
 So we end up in this kind of problematic scenario,

2:00:41.960 --> 2:00:45.040
 but it's okay because I think we're still,

2:00:45.040 --> 2:00:46.760
 you know, our heart's in the right place.

2:00:46.760 --> 2:00:47.840
 We're trying to move this forward

2:00:47.840 --> 2:00:49.220
 as a community sort of affair.

2:00:49.220 --> 2:00:50.520
 I think most of the people in the community

2:00:50.520 --> 2:00:53.000
 also appreciate the work we've done over the years

2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:54.280
 to try to move these things forward

2:00:54.280 --> 2:00:57.320
 in a collaborative fashion, so.

2:00:57.320 --> 2:01:01.200
 One of the subgraphs of dependencies

2:01:01.200 --> 2:01:03.560
 that became super complicated

2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:05.760
 is the move from Python 2 to Python 3.

2:01:05.760 --> 2:01:07.200
 So there's all these ways to mess

2:01:07.200 --> 2:01:11.520
 with these kinds of ecosystems of packages and so on.

2:01:11.520 --> 2:01:13.760
 So I just want to ask you about that particular one.

2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:18.000
 What do you think about the move from Python 2 to 3?

2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:19.440
 Why did it take so long?

2:01:19.440 --> 2:01:20.960
 What were, from your perspective,

2:01:20.960 --> 2:01:23.700
 just seeing the packages all struggle

2:01:23.700 --> 2:01:26.280
 and the community all struggle through this process,

2:01:26.280 --> 2:01:27.840
 what lessons do you take away from it?

2:01:27.840 --> 2:01:29.480
 Why did it take so long?

2:01:29.480 --> 2:01:33.380
 Looking back, some people perhaps underestimated

2:01:33.380 --> 2:01:36.760
 how much adoption Python 2 had.

2:01:38.120 --> 2:01:41.800
 I think some people also underestimated how much,

2:01:41.800 --> 2:01:44.440
 or they overestimated how much value

2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:47.400
 some of the new features in Python 3 really provided.

2:01:47.400 --> 2:01:49.720
 Like the things they really loved about Python 3

2:01:49.720 --> 2:01:52.600
 just didn't matter to some of these people in Python 2.

2:01:52.600 --> 2:01:56.440
 Because this change was happening as Python, SciPy,

2:01:56.440 --> 2:01:58.700
 was starting to take off really like past,

2:01:58.700 --> 2:02:00.000
 like a hockey stick of adoption

2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.880
 in the early data science era, in the early 2010s.

2:02:02.880 --> 2:02:04.880
 A lot of people were learning and onboarding

2:02:04.880 --> 2:02:06.280
 in whatever just worked.

2:02:06.280 --> 2:02:07.180
 And the teachers were like,

2:02:07.180 --> 2:02:09.080
 well, yeah, these libraries I need

2:02:09.080 --> 2:02:10.360
 are not supported in Python 3 yet,

2:02:10.360 --> 2:02:12.040
 I'm going to teach you Python 2.

2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:13.960
 Took a lot of advocacy to get people

2:02:13.960 --> 2:02:15.700
 to move over to Python 3.

2:02:15.700 --> 2:02:18.860
 So I think it wasn't any particular single thing,

2:02:18.860 --> 2:02:21.820
 but it was one of those death by a dozen cuts,

2:02:21.820 --> 2:02:25.480
 which just really made it hard to move off of Python 2.

2:02:25.480 --> 2:02:27.280
 And also Python 3 itself,

2:02:27.280 --> 2:02:28.820
 as they were kind of breaking things

2:02:28.820 --> 2:02:29.660
 and changing things around

2:02:29.660 --> 2:02:30.720
 and reorganizing the standard library,

2:02:30.720 --> 2:02:32.920
 there's a lot of stuff that was happening there

2:02:32.920 --> 2:02:35.880
 that kept giving people an excuse to say,

2:02:35.880 --> 2:02:37.760
 I'll put off till the next version.

2:02:37.760 --> 2:02:39.680
 2 is working fine enough for me right now.

2:02:39.680 --> 2:02:41.480
 So I think that's essentially what happened there.

2:02:41.480 --> 2:02:43.760
 And I will say this though,

2:02:43.760 --> 2:02:48.660
 the strength of the Python data science movement,

2:02:48.660 --> 2:02:52.440
 I think is what kept Python alive in that transition.

2:02:52.440 --> 2:02:54.040
 Because a lot of languages have died

2:02:54.040 --> 2:02:56.840
 and left their user bases behind.

2:02:56.840 --> 2:02:58.980
 If there wasn't the use of Python for data,

2:02:58.980 --> 2:03:01.160
 there's a good chunk of Python users

2:03:01.160 --> 2:03:02.740
 that during that transition,

2:03:02.740 --> 2:03:04.920
 would have just left for Go and Rust and stayed.

2:03:04.920 --> 2:03:06.220
 In fact, some people did.

2:03:06.220 --> 2:03:08.880
 They moved to Go and Rust and they just never looked back.

2:03:08.880 --> 2:03:13.720
 The fact that we were able to grow by millions of users,

2:03:13.720 --> 2:03:15.820
 the Python data community,

2:03:15.820 --> 2:03:18.320
 that is what kept the momentum for Python going.

2:03:18.320 --> 2:03:21.760
 And now the usage of Python for data is over 50%

2:03:21.760 --> 2:03:24.320
 of the overall Python user base.

2:03:24.320 --> 2:03:27.960
 So I'm happy to debate that on stage somewhere,

2:03:27.960 --> 2:03:29.920
 I don't know if they really wanna take issue

2:03:29.920 --> 2:03:31.600
 with that statement, but from where I sit,

2:03:31.600 --> 2:03:32.560
 I think that's true.

2:03:32.560 --> 2:03:35.280
 The statement there, the idea is that the switch

2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:39.040
 from Python 2 to Python 3 would have probably

2:03:39.040 --> 2:03:43.600
 destroyed Python if it didn't also coincide with Python

2:03:43.600 --> 2:03:45.780
 for whatever reason,

2:03:45.780 --> 2:03:49.680
 just overtaking the data science community,

2:03:49.680 --> 2:03:51.800
 anything that processes data.

2:03:51.800 --> 2:03:55.760
 So like the timing was perfect that this maybe

2:03:55.760 --> 2:03:59.080
 imperfect decision was coupled with a great timing

2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:02.080
 on the value of data in our world.

2:04:02.080 --> 2:04:04.780
 I would say the troubled execution of a good decision.

2:04:04.780 --> 2:04:07.360
 It was a decision that was necessary.

2:04:07.360 --> 2:04:08.840
 It's possible if we had more resources,

2:04:08.840 --> 2:04:11.120
 we could have done in a way that was a little bit smoother,

2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:15.200
 but ultimately, the arguments for Python 3,

2:04:15.200 --> 2:04:17.400
 I bought them at the time and I buy them now, right?

2:04:17.400 --> 2:04:20.800
 Having great text handling is like a nonnegotiable

2:04:20.800 --> 2:04:23.440
 table stakes thing you need to have in a language.

2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:28.440
 So that's great, but the execution,

2:04:29.480 --> 2:04:33.000
 Python is the, it's volunteer driven.

2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:34.880
 It's like now the most popular language on the planet,

2:04:34.880 --> 2:04:37.080
 but it's all literally volunteers.

2:04:37.080 --> 2:04:40.400
 So the lack of resources meant that they had to really,

2:04:40.400 --> 2:04:43.600
 they had to do things in a very hamstrung way.

2:04:43.600 --> 2:04:46.720
 And I think to carry the Python momentum in the language

2:04:46.720 --> 2:04:48.460
 through that time, the data movement

2:04:48.460 --> 2:04:49.920
 was a critical part of that.

2:04:49.920 --> 2:04:54.080
 So some of it is carrot and stick, I actually have to

2:04:54.080 --> 2:04:57.040
 shamefully admit that it took me a very long time

2:04:57.040 --> 2:04:58.760
 to switch from Python 2 and Python 3

2:04:58.760 --> 2:05:00.320
 because I'm a machine learning person.

2:05:00.320 --> 2:05:01.960
 It was just for the longest time,

2:05:01.960 --> 2:05:03.820
 you could just do fine with Python 2.

2:05:03.820 --> 2:05:04.960
 Right.

2:05:04.960 --> 2:05:09.200
 But I think the moment where I switched everybody

2:05:09.200 --> 2:05:13.080
 I worked with and switched myself for small projects

2:05:13.080 --> 2:05:17.700
 and big is when finally, when NumPy announced

2:05:17.700 --> 2:05:21.480
 that they're going to end support like in 2020

2:05:21.480 --> 2:05:22.320
 or something like that.

2:05:22.320 --> 2:05:23.160
 Right.

2:05:23.160 --> 2:05:26.200
 So like when I realized, oh, this isn't going,

2:05:26.200 --> 2:05:27.400
 this is going to end.

2:05:27.400 --> 2:05:28.240
 Right.

2:05:28.240 --> 2:05:29.720
 So that's the stick, that's not a carrot.

2:05:29.720 --> 2:05:31.720
 That's not, so for the longest time it was carrots.

2:05:31.720 --> 2:05:34.420
 It was like all of these packages were saying,

2:05:34.420 --> 2:05:37.460
 okay, we have Python 3 support now, come join us.

2:05:37.460 --> 2:05:40.120
 We have Python 2 and Python 3, but when NumPy,

2:05:40.120 --> 2:05:43.440
 one of the packages I sort of love and depend on

2:05:43.440 --> 2:05:47.660
 said like, nope, it's over.

2:05:47.660 --> 2:05:50.360
 That's when I decided to switch.

2:05:50.360 --> 2:05:53.840
 I wonder if you think it was possible much earlier

2:05:53.840 --> 2:05:58.840
 for somebody like NumPy or some major package

2:05:58.840 --> 2:06:03.840
 to step into the cold and say like we're ending this.

2:06:03.840 --> 2:06:05.320
 Well, it's a chicken and egg problem too, right?

2:06:05.320 --> 2:06:07.580
 You don't want to cut off a lot of users

2:06:07.580 --> 2:06:09.400
 unless you see the user momentum going too.

2:06:09.400 --> 2:06:12.900
 So the decisions for the scientific community

2:06:12.900 --> 2:06:14.080
 for each of the different projects,

2:06:14.080 --> 2:06:15.280
 you know, there's not a monolith.

2:06:15.280 --> 2:06:17.000
 Some projects are like, we'll only be releasing

2:06:17.000 --> 2:06:18.920
 new features on Python 3.

2:06:18.920 --> 2:06:21.400
 And that was more of a sticky carrot, right?

2:06:21.400 --> 2:06:23.520
 A firm carrot, if you will, a firm carrot.

2:06:26.360 --> 2:06:27.960
 A stick shaped carrot.

2:06:27.960 --> 2:06:30.680
 But then for others, yeah, NumPy in particular,

2:06:30.680 --> 2:06:32.680
 cause it's at the base of the dependency stack

2:06:32.680 --> 2:06:36.160
 for so many things, that was the final stick.

2:06:36.160 --> 2:06:37.600
 That was a stick shaped stick.

2:06:37.600 --> 2:06:40.080
 People were saying, look, if I have to keep maintaining

2:06:40.080 --> 2:06:43.640
 my releases for Python 2, that's that much less energy

2:06:43.640 --> 2:06:45.700
 that I can put into making things better

2:06:45.700 --> 2:06:48.160
 for the Python 3 folks or in my new version,

2:06:48.160 --> 2:06:49.920
 which is of course going to be Python 3.

2:06:49.920 --> 2:06:53.320
 So people were also getting kind of pulled by this tension.

2:06:53.320 --> 2:06:56.140
 So the overall community sort of had a lot of input

2:06:56.140 --> 2:06:58.480
 into when the NumPy core folks decided

2:06:58.480 --> 2:07:01.380
 that they would end of life on Python 2.

2:07:01.380 --> 2:07:04.000
 So as these numbers are a little bit loose,

2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:06.840
 but there are about 10 million Python programmers

2:07:06.840 --> 2:07:08.400
 in the world, you could argue that number,

2:07:08.400 --> 2:07:10.320
 but let's say 10 million.

2:07:10.320 --> 2:07:12.280
 That's actually where I was looking,

2:07:12.280 --> 2:07:17.240
 said 27 million total programmers, developers in the world.

2:07:17.240 --> 2:07:20.540
 You mentioned in a talk that changes need to be made

2:07:20.540 --> 2:07:24.000
 for there to be 100 million Python programmers.

2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:26.020
 So first of all, do you see a future

2:07:26.020 --> 2:07:28.280
 where there's 100 million Python programmers?

2:07:28.280 --> 2:07:31.320
 And second, what kind of changes need to be made?

2:07:31.320 --> 2:07:33.200
 So Anaconda and Miniconda get downloaded

2:07:33.200 --> 2:07:34.880
 about a million times a week.

2:07:34.880 --> 2:07:37.720
 So I think the idea that there's only

2:07:37.720 --> 2:07:39.320
 10 million Python programmers in the world

2:07:39.320 --> 2:07:41.960
 is a little bit undercounting.

2:07:41.960 --> 2:07:44.860
 There are a lot of people who escape traditional counting

2:07:44.860 --> 2:07:48.440
 that are using Python and data in their jobs.

2:07:48.440 --> 2:07:52.100
 I do believe that the future world for it to,

2:07:52.100 --> 2:07:53.280
 well, the world I would like to see

2:07:53.280 --> 2:07:56.240
 is one where people are data literate.

2:07:56.240 --> 2:07:58.600
 So they are able to use tools

2:07:58.600 --> 2:08:02.060
 that let them express their questions and ideas fluidly.

2:08:03.180 --> 2:08:06.440
 And the data variety and data complexity will not go down.

2:08:06.440 --> 2:08:08.320
 It will only keep increasing.

2:08:08.320 --> 2:08:12.460
 So I think some level of code or code like things

2:08:12.460 --> 2:08:15.460
 will continue to be relevant.

2:08:15.460 --> 2:08:19.760
 And so my hope is that we can build systems

2:08:19.760 --> 2:08:22.900
 that allow people to more seamlessly integrate

2:08:22.900 --> 2:08:26.040
 Python kinds of expressivity with data systems

2:08:26.040 --> 2:08:30.000
 and operationalization methods that are much more seamless.

2:08:31.200 --> 2:08:32.380
 And what I mean by that is, you know,

2:08:32.380 --> 2:08:35.660
 right now you can't punch Python code into an Excel cell.

2:08:35.660 --> 2:08:37.960
 I mean, there's some tools you can do to kind of do this.

2:08:37.960 --> 2:08:39.920
 We didn't build a thing for doing this back in the day,

2:08:39.920 --> 2:08:43.820
 but I feel like the total addressable market

2:08:43.820 --> 2:08:46.860
 for Python users, if we do the things right,

2:08:46.860 --> 2:08:49.080
 is on the order of the Excel users,

2:08:49.080 --> 2:08:51.180
 which is, you know, a few hundred million.

2:08:51.180 --> 2:08:56.180
 So I think Python has to get better at being embedded,

2:08:57.300 --> 2:08:59.660
 you know, being a smaller thing that pulls in

2:08:59.660 --> 2:09:01.720
 just the right parts of the ecosystem

2:09:01.720 --> 2:09:05.560
 to run numerics and do data exploration,

2:09:05.560 --> 2:09:07.920
 meeting people where they're already at

2:09:07.920 --> 2:09:09.640
 with their data and their data tools.

2:09:09.640 --> 2:09:12.800
 And then I think also it has to be easier

2:09:12.800 --> 2:09:14.720
 to take some of those things they've written

2:09:14.720 --> 2:09:17.540
 and flow those back into deployed systems

2:09:17.540 --> 2:09:19.460
 or little apps or visualizations.

2:09:19.460 --> 2:09:20.720
 I think if we don't do those things,

2:09:20.720 --> 2:09:23.160
 then we will always be kept in a silo

2:09:23.160 --> 2:09:25.920
 as sort of an expert user's tool

2:09:25.920 --> 2:09:27.400
 and not a tool for the masses.

2:09:27.400 --> 2:09:28.960
 You know, I work with a bunch of folks

2:09:28.960 --> 2:09:32.520
 in the Adobe Creative Suite,

2:09:32.520 --> 2:09:35.400
 and I'm kind of forcing them or inspired them

2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:38.560
 to learn Python, to do a bunch of stuff that helps them.

2:09:38.560 --> 2:09:39.840
 And it's interesting, because they probably

2:09:39.840 --> 2:09:41.740
 wouldn't call themselves Python programmers,

2:09:41.740 --> 2:09:43.820
 but they're all using Python.

2:09:43.820 --> 2:09:46.480
 I would love it if the tools like Photoshop and Premiere

2:09:46.480 --> 2:09:48.760
 and all those kinds of tools that are targeted

2:09:48.760 --> 2:09:52.080
 towards creative people, I guess that's where Excel,

2:09:52.080 --> 2:09:54.220
 Excel is targeted towards a certain kind of audience

2:09:54.220 --> 2:09:56.320
 that works with data, financial people,

2:09:56.320 --> 2:10:00.040
 all that kind of stuff, if there would be easy ways

2:10:00.040 --> 2:10:03.600
 to leverage to use Python for quick scripting tasks.

2:10:03.600 --> 2:10:06.760
 And you know, there's an exciting application

2:10:06.760 --> 2:10:09.760
 of artificial intelligence in this space

2:10:09.760 --> 2:10:13.280
 that I'm hopeful about, looking at open AI codecs

2:10:13.280 --> 2:10:16.940
 with generating programs.

2:10:16.940 --> 2:10:20.800
 So almost helping people bridge the gap

2:10:20.800 --> 2:10:25.800
 from kind of visual interface to generating programs,

2:10:25.840 --> 2:10:28.980
 to something formal, and then they can modify it and so on,

2:10:28.980 --> 2:10:32.360
 but kind of without having to read the manual,

2:10:32.360 --> 2:10:34.880
 without having to do a Google search and stack overflow,

2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:36.760
 which is essentially what a neural network does

2:10:36.760 --> 2:10:39.040
 when it's doing code generation,

2:10:39.040 --> 2:10:42.840
 is actually generating code and allowing a human

2:10:42.840 --> 2:10:44.760
 to communicate with multiple programs,

2:10:44.760 --> 2:10:46.540
 and then maybe even programs to communicate

2:10:46.540 --> 2:10:48.420
 with each other via Python.

2:10:48.420 --> 2:10:51.220
 So that to me is a really exciting possibility,

2:10:51.220 --> 2:10:55.960
 because I think there's a friction to kind of,

2:10:55.960 --> 2:10:58.920
 like how do I learn how to use Python in my life?

2:10:58.920 --> 2:11:03.000
 There's oftentimes you kind of start a class,

2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:07.080
 you start learning about types, I don't know, functions.

2:11:07.080 --> 2:11:09.600
 Like this is, you know, Python is the first language

2:11:09.600 --> 2:11:11.920
 with which you start to learn to program.

2:11:11.920 --> 2:11:16.680
 But I feel like that's going to take a long time

2:11:16.680 --> 2:11:18.560
 for you to understand why it's useful.

2:11:18.560 --> 2:11:20.300
 You almost want to start with a script.

2:11:20.300 --> 2:11:22.000
 Well, you do, in fact.

2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:24.840
 I think starting with the theory behind programming languages

2:11:24.840 --> 2:11:26.100
 and types and all that, I mean,

2:11:26.100 --> 2:11:30.000
 types are there to make the compiler writer's jobs easier.

2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:32.760
 Types are not, I mean, heck, do you have an ontology

2:11:32.760 --> 2:11:34.320
 of types or just the objects on this table?

2:11:34.320 --> 2:11:35.560
 No.

2:11:35.560 --> 2:11:39.160
 So types are there because compiler writers are human

2:11:39.160 --> 2:11:40.840
 and they're limited in what they can do.

2:11:40.840 --> 2:11:45.100
 But I think that the beauty of scripting,

2:11:45.100 --> 2:11:47.560
 like there's a Python book that's called

2:11:47.560 --> 2:11:49.200
 "'Automate the Boring Stuff,'

2:11:49.200 --> 2:11:51.120
 which is exactly the right mentality.

2:11:51.120 --> 2:11:55.480
 I grew up with computers in a time when I could,

2:11:56.720 --> 2:11:58.840
 when Steve Jobs was still pitching these things

2:11:58.840 --> 2:11:59.880
 as bicycles for the mind.

2:11:59.880 --> 2:12:03.300
 They were supposed to not be just media consumption devices,

2:12:03.300 --> 2:12:05.920
 but they were actually, you could write some code.

2:12:05.920 --> 2:12:07.280
 You could write basic, you could write some stuff

2:12:07.280 --> 2:12:09.000
 to do some things.

2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:12.160
 And that feeling of a computer as a thing

2:12:12.160 --> 2:12:14.240
 that we can use to extend ourselves

2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:17.780
 has all but evaporated for a lot of people.

2:12:17.780 --> 2:12:19.520
 So you see a little bit in parts

2:12:19.520 --> 2:12:21.560
 in the current, the generation of youth

2:12:21.560 --> 2:12:23.560
 around Minecraft or Roblox, right?

2:12:23.560 --> 2:12:25.120
 And I think Python, circuit Python,

2:12:25.120 --> 2:12:28.800
 these things could be a renaissance of that,

2:12:28.800 --> 2:12:32.660
 of people actually shaping and using their computers

2:12:32.660 --> 2:12:35.500
 as computers, as an extension of their minds

2:12:35.500 --> 2:12:37.880
 and their curiosity, their creativity.

2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:41.560
 So you talk about scripting the Adobe Suite with Python

2:12:41.560 --> 2:12:42.920
 in the 3D graphics world.

2:12:42.920 --> 2:12:46.320
 Python is a scripting language

2:12:46.320 --> 2:12:48.760
 that some of these 3D graphics suites use.

2:12:48.760 --> 2:12:49.600
 And I think that's great.

2:12:49.600 --> 2:12:51.280
 We should better support those kinds of things.

2:12:51.280 --> 2:12:54.200
 But ultimately the idea that I should be able

2:12:54.200 --> 2:12:56.280
 to have power over my computing environment.

2:12:56.280 --> 2:12:59.640
 If I want these things to happen repeatedly all the time,

2:12:59.640 --> 2:13:02.640
 I should be able to say that somehow to the computer, right?

2:13:02.640 --> 2:13:06.520
 Now, whether the operating systems get there faster

2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:09.560
 by having some Siri backed with open AI with whatever.

2:13:09.560 --> 2:13:10.860
 So you can just say, Siri, make this do this

2:13:10.860 --> 2:13:12.640
 and this and every other Friday, right?

2:13:12.640 --> 2:13:14.240
 We probably will get there somewhere.

2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:15.880
 And Apple's always had these ideas.

2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:19.160
 There's the Apple script in the menu that no one ever uses,

2:13:19.160 --> 2:13:21.640
 but you can do these kinds of things.

2:13:21.640 --> 2:13:23.700
 But when you start doing that kind of scripting,

2:13:23.700 --> 2:13:25.920
 the challenge isn't learning the type system

2:13:25.920 --> 2:13:27.160
 or even the syntax of the language.

2:13:27.160 --> 2:13:29.240
 The challenge is all of the dictionaries

2:13:29.240 --> 2:13:31.160
 and all the objects of all their properties

2:13:31.160 --> 2:13:32.840
 and attributes and parameters.

2:13:32.840 --> 2:13:35.420
 Like who's got time to learn all that stuff, right?

2:13:35.420 --> 2:13:38.840
 So that's when then programming by prototype

2:13:38.840 --> 2:13:40.960
 or by example becomes the right way

2:13:40.960 --> 2:13:43.780
 to get the user to express their desire.

2:13:43.780 --> 2:13:45.200
 So there's a lot of these different ways

2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:46.060
 that we can approach programming.

2:13:46.060 --> 2:13:48.280
 But I do think when, as you were talking

2:13:48.280 --> 2:13:49.800
 about the Adobe scripting thing,

2:13:49.800 --> 2:13:51.340
 I was thinking about, you know,

2:13:51.340 --> 2:13:53.780
 when we do use something like NumPy,

2:13:53.780 --> 2:13:55.760
 when we use things in the Python data

2:13:55.760 --> 2:14:00.160
 and scientific, let's say, expression system,

2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:01.360
 there's a reason we use that,

2:14:01.360 --> 2:14:04.400
 which is that it gives us mathematical precision.

2:14:04.400 --> 2:14:06.800
 It gives us actually quite a lot of precision

2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:09.960
 over precisely what we mean about this data set,

2:14:09.960 --> 2:14:11.800
 that data set, and it's the fact

2:14:11.800 --> 2:14:13.680
 that we can have that precision

2:14:13.680 --> 2:14:18.680
 that lets Python be powerful over as a duct tape for data.

2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:21.240
 You know, you give me a TSV or a CSV,

2:14:21.240 --> 2:14:25.120
 and if you give me some massively expensive vendor tool

2:14:25.120 --> 2:14:26.460
 for data transformation,

2:14:26.460 --> 2:14:28.280
 I don't know I'm gonna be able to solve your problem.

2:14:28.280 --> 2:14:30.600
 But if you give me a Python prompt,

2:14:30.600 --> 2:14:32.500
 you can throw whatever data you want at me.

2:14:32.500 --> 2:14:34.400
 I will be able to mash it into shape.

2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:38.360
 So that ability to take it as sort of this like,

2:14:38.360 --> 2:14:40.320
 you know, machete out into the data jungle

2:14:40.320 --> 2:14:41.600
 is really powerful.

2:14:41.600 --> 2:14:44.300
 And I think that's why at some level,

2:14:44.300 --> 2:14:47.760
 we're not gonna get away from some of these expressions

2:14:47.760 --> 2:14:51.660
 and APIs and libraries in Python for data transformation.

2:14:53.960 --> 2:14:57.280
 You've been at the center of the Python community

2:14:57.280 --> 2:14:58.400
 for many years.

2:14:58.400 --> 2:15:03.400
 If you could change one thing about the community

2:15:03.640 --> 2:15:05.540
 to help it grow, to help it improve,

2:15:05.540 --> 2:15:09.440
 to help it flourish and prosper, what would it be?

2:15:09.440 --> 2:15:11.720
 I mean, you know, it doesn't have to be one thing,

2:15:11.720 --> 2:15:13.880
 but what kind of comes to mind?

2:15:13.880 --> 2:15:15.360
 What are the challenges?

2:15:15.360 --> 2:15:16.840
 Humility is one of the values that we have

2:15:16.840 --> 2:15:17.940
 at Anaconda at the company,

2:15:17.940 --> 2:15:21.320
 but it's also one of the values in the community.

2:15:21.320 --> 2:15:24.480
 That it's been breached a little bit in the last few years,

2:15:24.480 --> 2:15:27.360
 but in general, people are quite decent

2:15:27.360 --> 2:15:29.320
 and reasonable and nice.

2:15:29.320 --> 2:15:32.620
 And that humility prevents them from seeing

2:15:34.420 --> 2:15:36.880
 the greatness that they could have.

2:15:36.880 --> 2:15:40.800
 I don't know how many people in the core Python community

2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:45.800
 really understand that they stand perched at the edge

2:15:46.280 --> 2:15:50.160
 of an opportunity to transform how people use computers.

2:15:50.160 --> 2:15:52.760
 And actually, PyCon, I think it's the last physical PyCon

2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:56.680
 I went to, Russell Keith McGee gave a great keynote

2:15:56.680 --> 2:16:00.560
 about very much along the lines of the challenges I have,

2:16:00.560 --> 2:16:04.320
 which is Python, for a language that doesn't actually,

2:16:04.320 --> 2:16:05.720
 that can't put an interface up,

2:16:05.720 --> 2:16:09.360
 put an interface up on the most popular computing devices,

2:16:09.360 --> 2:16:11.800
 it's done really well as a language, hasn't it?

2:16:11.800 --> 2:16:13.720
 You can't write a web front end with Python, really.

2:16:13.720 --> 2:16:15.080
 I mean, everyone uses JavaScript.

2:16:15.080 --> 2:16:17.040
 You certainly can't write native apps.

2:16:17.040 --> 2:16:20.580
 So for a language that you can't actually write apps

2:16:20.580 --> 2:16:22.720
 in any of those front end runtime environments,

2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:24.360
 Python's done exceedingly well.

2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:28.760
 And so that wasn't to pat ourselves on the back.

2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:30.580
 That was to challenge ourselves as a community to say,

2:16:30.580 --> 2:16:32.520
 we, through our current volunteer dynamic,

2:16:32.520 --> 2:16:34.460
 have gotten to this point.

2:16:34.460 --> 2:16:36.720
 What comes next and how do we seize,

2:16:36.720 --> 2:16:38.620
 you know, we've caught the tiger by the tail.

2:16:38.620 --> 2:16:40.960
 How do we make sure we keep up with it as it goes forward?

2:16:40.960 --> 2:16:42.440
 So that's one of the questions I have

2:16:42.440 --> 2:16:44.240
 about sort of open source communities,

2:16:44.240 --> 2:16:48.500
 is at its best, there's a kind of humility.

2:16:48.500 --> 2:16:52.500
 Is that humility prevent you to have a vision

2:16:52.500 --> 2:16:55.560
 for creating something like very new and powerful?

2:16:55.560 --> 2:16:57.640
 And you've brought us back to consciousness again.

2:16:57.640 --> 2:17:00.700
 The collaboration is a swarm emergent dynamic.

2:17:00.700 --> 2:17:02.640
 Humility lets these people work together

2:17:02.640 --> 2:17:04.840
 without anyone trouncing anyone else.

2:17:04.840 --> 2:17:07.200
 How do they, you know, in consciousness,

2:17:07.200 --> 2:17:08.680
 there's the question of the binding problem.

2:17:08.680 --> 2:17:10.720
 How does a singular, our attention,

2:17:10.720 --> 2:17:13.880
 how does that emerge from billions of neurons?

2:17:13.880 --> 2:17:17.680
 So how can you have a swarm of people emerge a consensus

2:17:17.680 --> 2:17:20.620
 that has a singular vision to say, we will do this.

2:17:20.620 --> 2:17:23.880
 And most importantly, we're not gonna do these things.

2:17:23.880 --> 2:17:28.880
 Emerging a coherent, pointed, focused leadership dynamic

2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:32.060
 from a collaboration, being able to do that kind of,

2:17:32.060 --> 2:17:34.040
 and then dissolve it so people can still do

2:17:34.040 --> 2:17:37.240
 the swarm thing, that's a problem, that's a question.

2:17:37.240 --> 2:17:39.580
 So do you have to have a charismatic leader?

2:17:40.800 --> 2:17:42.640
 For some reason, Linus Torvald comes to mind,

2:17:42.640 --> 2:17:44.640
 but there's people who criticize.

2:17:44.640 --> 2:17:46.640
 He rules with an iron fist, man.

2:17:46.640 --> 2:17:48.520
 But there's still charisma to it.

2:17:48.520 --> 2:17:49.520
 There is charisma, right?

2:17:49.520 --> 2:17:51.760
 There's a charisma to that iron fist.

2:17:51.760 --> 2:17:55.320
 There's, every leader's different, I would say,

2:17:55.320 --> 2:17:56.700
 in their success.

2:17:56.700 --> 2:17:59.480
 So he doesn't, I don't even know if you can say

2:17:59.480 --> 2:18:04.480
 he doesn't have humility, there's such a meritocracy

2:18:04.840 --> 2:18:09.000
 of ideas that like, this is a good idea

2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:10.440
 and this is a bad idea.

2:18:10.440 --> 2:18:11.640
 There's a step function to it.

2:18:11.640 --> 2:18:13.920
 Once you clear a threshold, he's open.

2:18:13.920 --> 2:18:15.680
 Once you clear the bozo threshold,

2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:17.560
 he's open to your ideas, I think, right?

2:18:17.560 --> 2:18:20.280
 But see, the interesting thing is obviously

2:18:20.280 --> 2:18:23.440
 that will not stand in an open source community

2:18:23.440 --> 2:18:25.920
 if that threshold that is defined

2:18:25.920 --> 2:18:30.320
 by that one particular person is not actually that good.

2:18:30.320 --> 2:18:33.720
 So you actually have to be really excellent at what you do.

2:18:33.720 --> 2:18:37.120
 So he's very good at what he does.

2:18:37.120 --> 2:18:39.040
 And so there's some aspect of leadership

2:18:39.040 --> 2:18:42.920
 where you can get thrown out, people can just leave.

2:18:42.920 --> 2:18:45.960
 That's how it works with open source, the fork.

2:18:45.960 --> 2:18:49.940
 But at the same time, you want to sometimes be a leader

2:18:49.940 --> 2:18:52.440
 like with a strong opinion, because people,

2:18:52.440 --> 2:18:54.440
 I mean, there's some kind of balance here

2:18:54.440 --> 2:18:57.400
 for this like hive mind to get like behind.

2:18:57.400 --> 2:18:58.520
 Leadership is a big topic.

2:18:58.520 --> 2:18:59.880
 And I didn't, I'm not one of these guys

2:18:59.880 --> 2:19:01.120
 that went to MBA school and said,

2:19:01.120 --> 2:19:03.560
 I'm gonna be an entrepreneur and I'm gonna be a leader.

2:19:03.560 --> 2:19:05.280
 And I'm gonna read all these Harvard Business Review

2:19:05.280 --> 2:19:07.760
 articles on leadership and all this other stuff.

2:19:07.760 --> 2:19:10.700
 Like I was a physicist turned into a software nerd

2:19:10.700 --> 2:19:13.600
 who then really like nerded out on Python.

2:19:13.600 --> 2:19:14.840
 And now I am entrepreneurial, right?

2:19:14.840 --> 2:19:16.280
 I saw a business opportunity around the use

2:19:16.280 --> 2:19:17.120
 of Python for data.

2:19:17.120 --> 2:19:20.720
 But for me, what has been interesting over this journey

2:19:20.720 --> 2:19:25.320
 with the last 10 years is how much I started really

2:19:25.320 --> 2:19:28.520
 enjoying the understanding, thinking deeper

2:19:28.520 --> 2:19:31.320
 about organizational dynamics and leadership.

2:19:31.320 --> 2:19:35.280
 And leadership does come down to a few core things.

2:19:35.280 --> 2:19:40.000
 Number one, a leader has to create belief

2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:42.300
 or at least has to dispel disbelief.

2:19:44.060 --> 2:19:46.480
 Leadership also, you have to have vision,

2:19:46.480 --> 2:19:49.360
 loyalty and experience.

2:19:49.360 --> 2:19:52.640
 So can you say belief in a singular vision?

2:19:52.640 --> 2:19:53.680
 Like what does belief mean?

2:19:53.680 --> 2:19:55.240
 Yeah, belief means a few things.

2:19:55.240 --> 2:19:57.000
 Belief means here's what we need to do

2:19:57.000 --> 2:20:00.040
 and this is a valid thing to do and we can do it.

2:20:01.600 --> 2:20:06.040
 That you have to be able to drive that belief.

2:20:06.040 --> 2:20:08.800
 And every step of leadership along the way

2:20:08.800 --> 2:20:12.680
 has to help you amplify that belief to more people.

2:20:12.680 --> 2:20:15.920
 I mean, I think at a fundamental level, that's what it is.

2:20:15.920 --> 2:20:17.120
 You have to have a vision.

2:20:17.120 --> 2:20:20.920
 You have to be able to show people that,

2:20:20.920 --> 2:20:23.640
 or you have to convince people to believe in the vision

2:20:23.640 --> 2:20:25.240
 and to get behind you.

2:20:25.240 --> 2:20:26.480
 And that's where the loyalty part comes in

2:20:26.480 --> 2:20:28.200
 and the experience part comes in.

2:20:28.200 --> 2:20:30.200
 There's all different flavors of leadership.

2:20:30.200 --> 2:20:34.320
 So if we talk about Linus, we could talk about Elon Musk

2:20:34.320 --> 2:20:38.440
 and Steve Jobs, there's Sunder Prachai.

2:20:38.440 --> 2:20:40.760
 There's people that kind of put themselves at the center

2:20:40.760 --> 2:20:42.560
 and are strongly opinionated.

2:20:42.560 --> 2:20:45.160
 And some people are more like consensus builders.

2:20:45.160 --> 2:20:47.720
 What works well for open source?

2:20:47.720 --> 2:20:49.680
 What works well in the space of programmers?

2:20:49.680 --> 2:20:53.240
 So you've been a programmer, you've led many programmers

2:20:53.240 --> 2:20:55.600
 that are now sort of at the center of this ecosystem.

2:20:55.600 --> 2:20:58.960
 What works well in the programming world would you say?

2:20:58.960 --> 2:21:01.120
 It really depends on the people.

2:21:01.120 --> 2:21:02.600
 What style of leadership is best?

2:21:02.600 --> 2:21:04.160
 And it depends on the programming community.

2:21:04.160 --> 2:21:06.320
 I think for the Python community,

2:21:06.320 --> 2:21:08.560
 servant leadership is one of the values.

2:21:08.560 --> 2:21:11.720
 At the end of the day, the leader has to also be

2:21:11.720 --> 2:21:14.720
 the high priest of values, right?

2:21:14.720 --> 2:21:19.160
 So any collection of people has values of their living.

2:21:19.160 --> 2:21:23.680
 And if you want to maintain certain values

2:21:23.680 --> 2:21:26.280
 and those values help you as an organization

2:21:26.280 --> 2:21:27.520
 become more powerful,

2:21:27.520 --> 2:21:30.560
 then the leader has to live those values unequivocally

2:21:30.560 --> 2:21:33.600
 and has to hold the values.

2:21:33.600 --> 2:21:36.680
 So in our case, in this collaborative community

2:21:36.680 --> 2:21:41.400
 around Python, I think that the humility

2:21:41.400 --> 2:21:42.920
 is one of those values.

2:21:42.920 --> 2:21:45.320
 Servant leadership, you actually have to kind of do the stuff.

2:21:45.320 --> 2:21:47.760
 You have to walk the walk, not just talk the talk.

2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:52.040
 I don't feel like the Python community really demands

2:21:52.040 --> 2:21:53.800
 that much from a vision standpoint.

2:21:53.800 --> 2:21:54.760
 And they should.

2:21:54.760 --> 2:21:56.680
 And I think they should.

2:21:56.680 --> 2:22:00.840
 This is the interesting thing is like so many people

2:22:00.840 --> 2:22:04.720
 use Python, from where comes the vision?

2:22:04.720 --> 2:22:07.640
 You know, like you have a Elon Musk type character

2:22:07.640 --> 2:22:12.160
 who makes bold statements about the vision

2:22:12.160 --> 2:22:14.640
 for particular companies he's involved with.

2:22:14.640 --> 2:22:18.680
 And it's like, I think a lot of people that work

2:22:18.680 --> 2:22:22.560
 at those companies kind of can only last

2:22:22.560 --> 2:22:24.680
 if they believe that vision.

2:22:24.680 --> 2:22:26.240
 And some of it is super bold.

2:22:26.240 --> 2:22:28.600
 So my question is, and by the way,

2:22:28.600 --> 2:22:30.280
 those companies often use Python.

2:22:32.520 --> 2:22:33.760
 How do you establish a vision?

2:22:33.760 --> 2:22:37.360
 Like get to 100 million users, right?

2:22:37.360 --> 2:22:42.280
 Get to where, you know, the Python is at the center

2:22:42.280 --> 2:22:46.760
 of the machine learning and was it data science,

2:22:46.760 --> 2:22:48.440
 machine learning, deep learning,

2:22:48.440 --> 2:22:51.720
 artificial intelligence revolution, right?

2:22:51.720 --> 2:22:54.920
 Like in many ways, perhaps the Python community

2:22:54.920 --> 2:22:55.840
 is not thinking of it that way,

2:22:55.840 --> 2:22:58.160
 but it's leading the way on this.

2:22:58.160 --> 2:23:01.240
 Like the tooling is like essential.

2:23:01.240 --> 2:23:03.320
 Right, well, you know, for a while,

2:23:03.320 --> 2:23:05.840
 PyCon people in the scientific Python

2:23:05.840 --> 2:23:09.320
 and the PyData community, they would submit talks.

2:23:09.320 --> 2:23:12.160
 Those are early 2010s, mid 2010s.

2:23:12.160 --> 2:23:14.080
 They would submit talks for PyCon

2:23:14.080 --> 2:23:15.760
 and the talks would all be rejected

2:23:15.760 --> 2:23:18.680
 because there was the separate sort of PyData conferences.

2:23:18.680 --> 2:23:21.200
 And like, well, these probably belong more to PyData.

2:23:21.200 --> 2:23:23.520
 And instead there'd be yet another talk about, you know,

2:23:23.520 --> 2:23:26.400
 threads and, you know, whatever, some web framework.

2:23:26.400 --> 2:23:29.880
 And it's like, that was an interesting dynamic to see

2:23:29.880 --> 2:23:32.680
 that there was, I mean, at the time it was a little annoying

2:23:32.680 --> 2:23:34.280
 because we wanted to try to get more users

2:23:34.280 --> 2:23:35.760
 and get more people talking about these things.

2:23:35.760 --> 2:23:37.320
 And PyCon is a huge venue, right?

2:23:37.320 --> 2:23:40.240
 It's thousands of Python programmers.

2:23:40.240 --> 2:23:42.200
 But then also came to appreciate that, you know,

2:23:42.200 --> 2:23:45.400
 parallel, having an ecosystem that allows parallel

2:23:45.400 --> 2:23:47.400
 innovation is not bad, right?

2:23:47.400 --> 2:23:49.040
 There are people doing embedded Python stuff.

2:23:49.040 --> 2:23:50.640
 There's people doing web programming,

2:23:50.640 --> 2:23:53.280
 people doing scripting, there's cyber uses of Python.

2:23:53.280 --> 2:23:55.120
 I think the, ultimately at some point,

2:23:55.120 --> 2:23:58.040
 if your slide mold covers so much stuff,

2:23:58.040 --> 2:24:00.160
 you have to respect that different things are growing

2:24:00.160 --> 2:24:02.320
 in different areas and different niches.

2:24:02.320 --> 2:24:04.160
 Now, at some point that has to come together

2:24:04.160 --> 2:24:07.560
 and the central body has to provide resources.

2:24:07.560 --> 2:24:09.160
 The principle here is subsidiarity.

2:24:09.160 --> 2:24:11.760
 Give resources to the various groups

2:24:11.760 --> 2:24:15.040
 to then allocate as they see fit in their niches.

2:24:15.040 --> 2:24:16.360
 That would be a really helpful dynamic.

2:24:16.360 --> 2:24:17.520
 But again, it's a volunteer community.

2:24:17.520 --> 2:24:20.200
 It's not like they had that many resources to start with.

2:24:21.160 --> 2:24:23.920
 What was or is your favorite programming setup?

2:24:23.920 --> 2:24:25.720
 What operating system, what keyboard,

2:24:25.720 --> 2:24:29.080
 how many screens are you listening to?

2:24:29.080 --> 2:24:32.960
 What time of day are you drinking coffee, tea?

2:24:32.960 --> 2:24:36.280
 Tea, sometimes coffee, depending on how well I slept.

2:24:36.280 --> 2:24:37.120
 I used to have.

2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:38.120
 How much sleep do you get?

2:24:38.120 --> 2:24:39.680
 Are you a night owl?

2:24:39.680 --> 2:24:41.520
 I remember somebody asked you somewhere,

2:24:41.520 --> 2:24:43.360
 a question about work life balance.

2:24:44.880 --> 2:24:47.720
 Not just work life balance, but like a family,

2:24:47.720 --> 2:24:52.080
 you lead a company and your answer was basically like,

2:24:52.080 --> 2:24:54.240
 I still haven't figured it out.

2:24:54.240 --> 2:24:56.320
 Yeah, I think I've gotten to a little bit better balance.

2:24:56.320 --> 2:24:58.880
 I have a really great leadership team now supporting me

2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:01.680
 and so that takes a lot of the day to day stuff

2:25:01.680 --> 2:25:04.400
 off my plate and my kids are getting a little older.

2:25:04.400 --> 2:25:05.240
 So that helps.

2:25:05.240 --> 2:25:07.520
 So, and of course I have a wonderful wife

2:25:07.520 --> 2:25:09.240
 who takes care of a lot of the things

2:25:09.240 --> 2:25:11.680
 that I'm not able to take care of and she's great.

2:25:11.680 --> 2:25:13.760
 I try to get to sleep earlier now

2:25:13.760 --> 2:25:15.160
 because I have to get up every morning at six

2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:17.000
 to take my kid down to the bus stop.

2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:19.280
 So there's a hard thing.

2:25:19.280 --> 2:25:21.120
 For a while I was doing polyphasic sleep,

2:25:21.120 --> 2:25:22.040
 which is really interesting.

2:25:22.040 --> 2:25:24.640
 Like I go to bed at nine, wake up at like 2 a.m.,

2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:27.320
 work till five, sleep three hours, wake up at eight.

2:25:27.320 --> 2:25:29.360
 Like that was actually, it was interesting.

2:25:29.360 --> 2:25:30.200
 It wasn't too bad.

2:25:30.200 --> 2:25:31.160
 How did it feel?

2:25:31.160 --> 2:25:32.000
 It was good.

2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:34.960
 I didn't keep it up for years, but once I have travel,

2:25:34.960 --> 2:25:37.360
 then it just, everything goes out the window, right?

2:25:37.360 --> 2:25:39.120
 Because then you're like time zones and all these things.

2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:42.440
 Socially was it, except like were you able to live

2:25:42.440 --> 2:25:43.480
 outside of how you felt?

2:25:43.480 --> 2:25:45.720
 Were you able to live normal society?

2:25:45.720 --> 2:25:47.360
 Oh yeah, because like on the nights

2:25:47.360 --> 2:25:48.920
 that I wasn't out hanging out with people or whatever,

2:25:48.920 --> 2:25:50.680
 going to bed at nine, no one cares.

2:25:50.680 --> 2:25:52.720
 I wake up at two, I'm still responding to their slacks,

2:25:52.720 --> 2:25:56.880
 emails, whatever, and you know, shitposting on Twitter

2:25:56.880 --> 2:25:59.200
 or whatever at two in the morning is great, right?

2:25:59.200 --> 2:26:02.440
 And then you go to bed for a few hours and you wake up,

2:26:02.440 --> 2:26:04.520
 it's like you had an extra day in the middle.

2:26:04.520 --> 2:26:06.320
 And I'd read somewhere that humans naturally

2:26:06.320 --> 2:26:09.160
 have biphasic sleep or something, I don't know.

2:26:09.160 --> 2:26:11.160
 I read basically everything somewhere.

2:26:11.160 --> 2:26:13.400
 So every option of everything.

2:26:13.400 --> 2:26:14.520
 Every option of everything.

2:26:14.520 --> 2:26:16.840
 I will say that that worked out for me for a while,

2:26:16.840 --> 2:26:18.480
 although I don't do it anymore.

2:26:18.480 --> 2:26:19.400
 In terms of programming setup,

2:26:19.400 --> 2:26:24.400
 I had a 27 inch high DPI setup that I really liked,

2:26:24.840 --> 2:26:26.200
 but then I moved to a curved monitor

2:26:26.200 --> 2:26:28.840
 just because when I moved to the new house,

2:26:28.840 --> 2:26:32.440
 I want to have a bit more screen for Zoom plus communications

2:26:32.440 --> 2:26:33.280
 plus various kinds of things.

2:26:33.280 --> 2:26:35.800
 So it's like one large monitor.

2:26:35.800 --> 2:26:37.040
 One large curved monitor.

2:26:38.040 --> 2:26:39.720
 What operating system?

2:26:39.720 --> 2:26:40.640
 Mac.

2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:41.640
 Okay. Yeah.

2:26:41.640 --> 2:26:43.920
 Is that what happens when you become important,

2:26:43.920 --> 2:26:46.680
 is you stop using Linux and Windows?

2:26:46.680 --> 2:26:48.520
 No, I actually have a Windows box as well

2:26:48.520 --> 2:26:53.520
 on the next table over, but I have three desks, right?

2:26:54.360 --> 2:26:57.200
 So the main one is the standing desk so that I can,

2:26:57.200 --> 2:26:59.320
 whatever, when I'm like, I have a teleprompter set up

2:26:59.320 --> 2:27:00.160
 and everything else.

2:27:00.160 --> 2:27:05.160
 And then I've got my iMac and then eGPU and then Windows PC.

2:27:06.480 --> 2:27:10.680
 The reason I moved to Mac was it's got a Linux prompt

2:27:10.680 --> 2:27:13.000
 or no, sorry, it's got a, it's got a Unix prompt

2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:18.000
 so I can do all my stuff, but then I don't have to worry.

2:27:18.320 --> 2:27:19.640
 Like when I'm presenting for clients

2:27:19.640 --> 2:27:21.800
 or investors or whatever, like it,

2:27:21.800 --> 2:27:25.120
 I don't have to worry about any like ACPI related

2:27:25.120 --> 2:27:27.160
 fsic things in the middle of a presentation,

2:27:27.160 --> 2:27:28.000
 like none of that.

2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:29.800
 It just, it will always wake from sleep

2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:32.320
 and it won't kernel panic on me.

2:27:32.320 --> 2:27:34.200
 And this is not a dig against Linux,

2:27:34.200 --> 2:27:38.440
 except that I just, I feel really bad.

2:27:38.440 --> 2:27:40.180
 I feel like a traitor to my community saying this, right?

2:27:40.180 --> 2:27:43.240
 But in 2012, I was just like, okay, start my own company.

2:27:43.240 --> 2:27:44.060
 What do I get?

2:27:44.060 --> 2:27:47.520
 And Linux laptops were just not quite there.

2:27:47.520 --> 2:27:48.840
 And so I've just stuck with Macs.

2:27:48.840 --> 2:27:51.360
 Can I just defend something that nobody respectable

2:27:51.360 --> 2:27:55.800
 seems to do, which is, so I do a boot on Linux windows,

2:27:55.800 --> 2:27:59.560
 but in windows, I have a windows subsystems

2:27:59.560 --> 2:28:02.920
 for Linux or whatever, WSL.

2:28:02.920 --> 2:28:06.480
 And I find myself being able to handle everything I need

2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:08.360
 and almost everything I need in Linux

2:28:08.360 --> 2:28:11.280
 for basic sort of tasks, scripting tasks within WSL

2:28:11.280 --> 2:28:12.960
 and it creates a really nice environment.

2:28:12.960 --> 2:28:15.400
 So I've been, but like whenever I hang out with like,

2:28:15.400 --> 2:28:17.000
 especially important people,

2:28:17.920 --> 2:28:20.720
 like they're all on iPhone and a Mac

2:28:20.720 --> 2:28:23.360
 and it's like, yeah, like what,

2:28:23.360 --> 2:28:27.840
 there is a messiness to windows and a messiness to Linux

2:28:27.840 --> 2:28:31.880
 that makes me feel like you're still in it.

2:28:31.880 --> 2:28:34.700
 Well, the Linux stuff, windows subsystem for Linux

2:28:34.700 --> 2:28:37.840
 is very tempting, but there's still the windows

2:28:37.840 --> 2:28:40.280
 on the outside where I don't know where,

2:28:40.280 --> 2:28:44.160
 and I've been, okay, I've used DOS since version 1.11

2:28:44.160 --> 2:28:45.560
 or 1.21 or something.

2:28:45.560 --> 2:28:48.360
 So I've been a long time Microsoft user.

2:28:48.360 --> 2:28:52.120
 And I will say that like, it's really hard

2:28:52.120 --> 2:28:53.440
 for me to know where anything is,

2:28:53.440 --> 2:28:55.040
 how to get to the details behind something

2:28:55.040 --> 2:28:57.600
 when something screws up as an invariably does

2:28:57.600 --> 2:28:59.920
 and just things like changing group permissions

2:28:59.920 --> 2:29:01.400
 on some shared folders and stuff,

2:29:01.400 --> 2:29:03.600
 just everything seems a little bit more awkward,

2:29:03.600 --> 2:29:05.240
 more clicks than it needs to be.

2:29:06.440 --> 2:29:07.800
 Not to say that there aren't weird things

2:29:07.800 --> 2:29:09.880
 like hidden attributes and all this other happy stuff

2:29:09.880 --> 2:29:14.060
 on Mac, but for the most part,

2:29:14.060 --> 2:29:15.400
 and well, actually, especially now

2:29:15.400 --> 2:29:16.880
 with the new hardware coming out on Mac,

2:29:16.880 --> 2:29:19.020
 it'll be very interesting with the new M1.

2:29:20.080 --> 2:29:21.640
 There were some dark years in the last few years

2:29:21.640 --> 2:29:24.000
 when I was like, I think maybe I have to move off of Mac

2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:27.400
 as a platform, but this, I mean,

2:29:27.400 --> 2:29:29.080
 like my keyboard was just not working.

2:29:29.080 --> 2:29:31.200
 Like literally my keyboard just wasn't working, right?

2:29:31.200 --> 2:29:33.540
 I had this touch bar, didn't have a physical escape button

2:29:33.540 --> 2:29:35.200
 like I needed to because I used Vim,

2:29:35.200 --> 2:29:37.440
 and now I think we're back, so.

2:29:37.440 --> 2:29:40.340
 So you use Vim and you have a, what kind of keyboard?

2:29:40.340 --> 2:29:44.080
 So I use a RealForce 87U, it's a mechanical,

2:29:44.080 --> 2:29:45.240
 it's a Topre keyswitch.

2:29:45.240 --> 2:29:48.520
 Like it's a weird shape, there's a normal shape, okay.

2:29:48.520 --> 2:29:51.480
 Well, no, because I say that because I use a Kinesis,

2:29:51.480 --> 2:29:55.000
 and you said some dark, you said you had dark moments.

2:29:55.000 --> 2:29:57.440
 I recently had a dark moment,

2:29:57.440 --> 2:29:58.780
 I was like, what am I doing with my life?

2:29:58.780 --> 2:30:03.020
 So I remember sort of flying in a very kind of tight space,

2:30:03.020 --> 2:30:06.600
 and as I'm working, this is what I do on an airplane.

2:30:06.600 --> 2:30:09.600
 I pull out a laptop, and on top of the laptop,

2:30:09.600 --> 2:30:11.080
 I'll put a Kinesis keyboard.

2:30:11.080 --> 2:30:12.040
 That's hardcore, man.

2:30:12.040 --> 2:30:13.800
 I was thinking, is this who I am?

2:30:13.800 --> 2:30:15.080
 Is this what I'm becoming?

2:30:15.080 --> 2:30:16.200
 Will I be this person?

2:30:16.200 --> 2:30:18.560
 Because I'm on Emacs with this Kinesis keyboard,

2:30:18.560 --> 2:30:21.960
 sitting like with everybody around.

2:30:21.960 --> 2:30:23.620
 Emacs on Windows.

2:30:23.620 --> 2:30:25.600
 On WSL, yeah.

2:30:25.600 --> 2:30:27.360
 Yeah, Emacs on Linux on Windows.

2:30:27.360 --> 2:30:28.720
 Yeah, on Windows.

2:30:28.720 --> 2:30:32.200
 And like everybody around me is using their iPhone

2:30:32.200 --> 2:30:33.140
 to look at TikTok.

2:30:33.140 --> 2:30:36.560
 So I'm like in this land, and I thought, you know what?

2:30:36.560 --> 2:30:40.880
 Maybe I need to become an adult and put the 90s behind me,

2:30:40.880 --> 2:30:43.120
 and use like a normal keyboard.

2:30:43.120 --> 2:30:45.040
 And then I did some soul searching,

2:30:45.040 --> 2:30:46.760
 and I decided like this is who I am.

2:30:46.760 --> 2:30:48.520
 This is me like coming out of the closet

2:30:48.520 --> 2:30:50.760
 to saying I'm Kinesis keyboard all the way.

2:30:50.760 --> 2:30:52.840
 I'm going to use Emacs.

2:30:52.840 --> 2:30:55.160
 You know who else is a Kinesis fan?

2:30:55.160 --> 2:30:56.720
 Wes McKinney, the creator of Pandas.

2:30:56.720 --> 2:30:57.560
 Oh.

2:30:57.560 --> 2:31:00.000
 He banged out Pandas on a Kinesis keyboard, I believe.

2:31:00.000 --> 2:31:01.920
 I don't know if he's still using one, maybe,

2:31:01.920 --> 2:31:04.200
 but certainly 10 years ago, like he was.

2:31:04.200 --> 2:31:05.320
 If anyone's out there,

2:31:05.320 --> 2:31:07.520
 maybe we need to have a Kinesis support group.

2:31:07.520 --> 2:31:08.360
 Please reach out.

2:31:08.360 --> 2:31:09.440
 Isn't there already one?

2:31:09.440 --> 2:31:10.280
 Is there one?

2:31:10.280 --> 2:31:11.100
 I don't know.

2:31:11.100 --> 2:31:12.100
 There's gotta be an RSC channel, man.

2:31:12.100 --> 2:31:16.880
 Oh no, and you access it through Emacs.

2:31:16.880 --> 2:31:18.040
 Okay.

2:31:18.040 --> 2:31:19.600
 Do you still program these days?

2:31:19.600 --> 2:31:20.540
 I do a little bit.

2:31:21.440 --> 2:31:25.900
 Honestly, the last thing I did was I had written,

2:31:25.900 --> 2:31:28.540
 I was working with my son to script some Minecraft stuff.

2:31:28.540 --> 2:31:29.560
 So I was doing a little bit of that.

2:31:29.560 --> 2:31:33.100
 That was the last, literally the last code I wrote.

2:31:33.100 --> 2:31:33.940
 Oh, you know what?

2:31:33.940 --> 2:31:36.600
 Also, I wrote some code to do some cap table evaluation,

2:31:36.600 --> 2:31:38.240
 waterfall modeling kind of stuff.

2:31:39.260 --> 2:31:41.320
 What advice would you give to a young person,

2:31:41.320 --> 2:31:44.200
 you said your son, today, in high school,

2:31:44.200 --> 2:31:47.400
 maybe even college, about career, about life?

2:31:48.580 --> 2:31:51.120
 This may be where I get into trouble a little bit.

2:31:51.120 --> 2:31:53.380
 We are coming to the end.

2:31:53.380 --> 2:31:56.520
 We're rapidly entering a time between worlds.

2:31:56.520 --> 2:31:59.920
 So we have a world now that's starting to really crumble

2:31:59.920 --> 2:32:01.900
 under the weight of aging institutions

2:32:01.900 --> 2:32:04.460
 that no longer even pretend to serve the purposes

2:32:04.460 --> 2:32:05.740
 they were created for.

2:32:05.740 --> 2:32:09.060
 We are creating technologies that are hurtling billions

2:32:09.060 --> 2:32:11.460
 of people headlong into philosophical crises

2:32:11.460 --> 2:32:14.300
 who they don't even know the philosophical operating systems

2:32:14.300 --> 2:32:15.120
 in their firmware.

2:32:15.120 --> 2:32:17.840
 And they're heading into a time when that gets vaporized.

2:32:17.840 --> 2:32:20.100
 So for people in high school,

2:32:20.100 --> 2:32:21.520
 and certainly I tell my son this as well,

2:32:21.520 --> 2:32:24.920
 he's in middle school, people in college,

2:32:24.920 --> 2:32:29.740
 you are going to have to find your own way.

2:32:29.740 --> 2:32:31.700
 You're going to have to have a pioneer spirit,

2:32:31.700 --> 2:32:34.080
 even if you live in the middle

2:32:34.080 --> 2:32:36.360
 of the most dense urban environment.

2:32:36.360 --> 2:32:38.800
 All of human reality around you

2:32:40.120 --> 2:32:44.440
 is the result of the last few generations of humans

2:32:44.440 --> 2:32:47.360
 agreeing to play certain kinds of games.

2:32:47.360 --> 2:32:51.880
 A lot of those games no longer operate

2:32:51.880 --> 2:32:53.600
 according to the rules they used to.

2:32:55.760 --> 2:32:58.040
 Collapse is nonlinear, but it will be managed.

2:32:58.040 --> 2:33:02.200
 And so if you are in a particular social caste

2:33:02.200 --> 2:33:03.880
 or economic caste,

2:33:03.880 --> 2:33:08.880
 and I think it's not kosher to say that about America,

2:33:10.200 --> 2:33:14.140
 but America is a very stratified and classist society.

2:33:14.140 --> 2:33:17.080
 There's some mobility, but it's really quite classist.

2:33:17.080 --> 2:33:20.800
 And in America, unless you're in the upper middle class,

2:33:20.800 --> 2:33:23.520
 you are headed into very choppy waters.

2:33:23.520 --> 2:33:26.260
 So it is really, really good to think

2:33:26.260 --> 2:33:29.240
 and understand the fundamentals of what you need

2:33:29.240 --> 2:33:32.760
 to build a meaningful life for you, your loved ones,

2:33:32.760 --> 2:33:33.860
 with your family.

2:33:35.480 --> 2:33:38.000
 And almost all of the technology being created

2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:41.760
 that's consumer facing is designed to own people,

2:33:41.760 --> 2:33:46.760
 to take the four stack of people, to delaminate them,

2:33:47.120 --> 2:33:50.360
 and to own certain portions of that stack.

2:33:50.360 --> 2:33:52.280
 And so if you want to be an integral human being,

2:33:52.280 --> 2:33:54.400
 if you want to have your agency

2:33:54.400 --> 2:33:57.640
 and you want to find your own way in the world,

2:33:57.640 --> 2:34:00.580
 when you're young would be a great time to spend time

2:34:00.580 --> 2:34:02.960
 looking at some of the classics

2:34:02.960 --> 2:34:05.880
 around what it means to live a good life,

2:34:05.880 --> 2:34:08.080
 what it means to build connection with people.

2:34:08.080 --> 2:34:12.120
 And so much of the status game, so much of the stuff,

2:34:13.060 --> 2:34:14.860
 one of the things that I sort of talk about

2:34:14.860 --> 2:34:18.640
 as we create more and more technology,

2:34:18.640 --> 2:34:19.840
 there's a gradient of technology,

2:34:19.840 --> 2:34:20.820
 and a gradient of technology

2:34:20.820 --> 2:34:22.640
 always leads to a gradient of power.

2:34:22.640 --> 2:34:25.200
 And this is Jacques Leleu's point to some extent as well.

2:34:25.200 --> 2:34:27.280
 That gradient of power is not going to go away.

2:34:27.280 --> 2:34:29.900
 The technologies are going so fast

2:34:29.900 --> 2:34:32.040
 that even people like me who helped create

2:34:32.040 --> 2:34:33.640
 some of the stuff, I'm being left behind.

2:34:33.640 --> 2:34:34.680
 Some of the cutting edge research,

2:34:34.680 --> 2:34:36.800
 I don't know what's going on against today.

2:34:36.800 --> 2:34:38.660
 You know, I go read some proceedings.

2:34:38.660 --> 2:34:42.620
 So as the world gets more and more technological,

2:34:42.620 --> 2:34:44.240
 it will create more and more gradients

2:34:44.240 --> 2:34:48.400
 where people will seize power, economic fortunes.

2:34:48.400 --> 2:34:51.320
 And the way they make the people who are left behind

2:34:51.320 --> 2:34:54.480
 okay with their lot in life is they create lottery systems.

2:34:54.480 --> 2:34:59.480
 They make you take part in the narrative

2:35:00.020 --> 2:35:04.180
 of your own being trapped in your own economic sort of zone.

2:35:04.180 --> 2:35:07.920
 So avoiding those kinds of things is really important.

2:35:07.920 --> 2:35:10.740
 Knowing when someone is running game on you basically.

2:35:10.740 --> 2:35:12.260
 So these are the things I would tell young people.

2:35:12.260 --> 2:35:14.220
 It's a dark message, but it's realism.

2:35:14.220 --> 2:35:15.860
 I mean, that's what I see.

2:35:15.860 --> 2:35:18.500
 So after you gave some realism, you sit back.

2:35:18.500 --> 2:35:19.760
 You sit back with your son.

2:35:19.760 --> 2:35:21.700
 You're looking out at the sunset.

2:35:21.700 --> 2:35:26.700
 What to him can you give as words of hope and to you

2:35:27.900 --> 2:35:32.120
 from where do you derive hope for the future of our world?

2:35:32.120 --> 2:35:33.620
 So you said at the individual level,

2:35:33.620 --> 2:35:36.460
 you have to have a pioneer mindset

2:35:36.460 --> 2:35:38.100
 to go back to the classics,

2:35:38.100 --> 2:35:41.580
 to understand what is in human nature you can find meaning.

2:35:41.580 --> 2:35:44.500
 But at the societal level, what trajectory,

2:35:44.500 --> 2:35:47.460
 when you look up possible trajectories, what gives you hope?

2:35:47.460 --> 2:35:52.460
 What gives me hope is that we have little tremors now

2:35:52.780 --> 2:35:54.620
 shaking people out of the reverie

2:35:54.620 --> 2:35:57.020
 of the fiction of modernity that they've been living in,

2:35:57.020 --> 2:35:59.500
 kind of a late 20th century style modernity.

2:36:00.540 --> 2:36:02.860
 That's good, I think.

2:36:02.860 --> 2:36:06.400
 Because, and also to your point earlier,

2:36:06.400 --> 2:36:08.180
 people are burning out on some of the social media stuff.

2:36:08.180 --> 2:36:09.300
 They're sort of seeing the ugly side,

2:36:09.300 --> 2:36:11.620
 especially the latest news with Facebook

2:36:11.620 --> 2:36:12.820
 and the whistleblower, right?

2:36:12.820 --> 2:36:15.740
 It's quite clear these things are not

2:36:15.740 --> 2:36:16.740
 all they're cracked up to be.

2:36:16.740 --> 2:36:20.740
 Do you believe, I believe better social media can be built

2:36:20.740 --> 2:36:21.820
 because they are burning out

2:36:21.820 --> 2:36:25.300
 and it'll incentivize other competitors to be built.

2:36:25.300 --> 2:36:26.460
 Do you think that's possible?

2:36:26.460 --> 2:36:29.060
 Well, the thing about it is that

2:36:29.060 --> 2:36:32.100
 when you have extractive return on returns

2:36:33.820 --> 2:36:35.380
 capital coming in and saying,

2:36:35.380 --> 2:36:36.620
 look, you own a network,

2:36:36.620 --> 2:36:39.020
 give me some exponential dynamics out of this network.

2:36:39.020 --> 2:36:39.840
 What are you gonna do?

2:36:39.840 --> 2:36:41.460
 You're gonna just basically put a toll keeper

2:36:41.460 --> 2:36:45.220
 at every single node and every single graph edge,

2:36:45.220 --> 2:36:47.100
 every node, every vertex, every edge.

2:36:48.020 --> 2:36:49.920
 But if you don't have that need for it,

2:36:49.920 --> 2:36:51.220
 if no one's sitting there saying,

2:36:51.220 --> 2:36:53.260
 hey, Wikipedia, monetize every character,

2:36:53.260 --> 2:36:54.980
 every byte, every phrase,

2:36:54.980 --> 2:36:58.340
 then generative human dynamics will naturally sort of arise,

2:36:58.340 --> 2:37:01.140
 assuming we respect a few principles

2:37:01.140 --> 2:37:03.020
 around online communications.

2:37:03.020 --> 2:37:05.800
 So the greatest and biggest social network in the world

2:37:05.800 --> 2:37:08.780
 is still like email, SMS, right?

2:37:08.780 --> 2:37:10.580
 So we're fine there.

2:37:10.580 --> 2:37:13.220
 The issue with the social media, as we call it now,

2:37:13.220 --> 2:37:16.620
 is they're actually just new amplification systems, right?

2:37:16.620 --> 2:37:18.660
 Now it's benefited certain people like yourself

2:37:18.660 --> 2:37:23.140
 who have interesting content to be amplified.

2:37:23.140 --> 2:37:25.180
 So it's created a creator economy, and that's cool.

2:37:25.180 --> 2:37:26.820
 There's a lot of great content out there.

2:37:26.820 --> 2:37:29.300
 But giving everyone a shot at the fame lottery,

2:37:29.300 --> 2:37:31.500
 saying, hey, you could also have your,

2:37:31.500 --> 2:37:33.940
 if you wiggle your butt the right way on TikTok,

2:37:33.940 --> 2:37:36.100
 you can have your 15 seconds of micro fame.

2:37:36.100 --> 2:37:38.180
 That's not healthy for society at large.

2:37:38.180 --> 2:37:41.700
 So I think if we can create tools that help people

2:37:41.700 --> 2:37:45.180
 be conscientious about their attention,

2:37:45.180 --> 2:37:46.700
 spend time looking at the past,

2:37:46.700 --> 2:37:49.600
 and really retrieving memory and calling,

2:37:49.600 --> 2:37:53.260
 not calling, but processing and thinking about that,

2:37:53.260 --> 2:37:55.100
 I think that's certainly possible,

2:37:55.100 --> 2:37:57.260
 and hopefully that's what we get.

2:37:57.260 --> 2:38:01.020
 So the bigger question that you're asking

2:38:01.020 --> 2:38:02.380
 about what gives me hope

2:38:02.380 --> 2:38:07.380
 is that these early shocks of COVID lockdowns

2:38:08.140 --> 2:38:11.620
 and remote work and all these different kinds of things,

2:38:11.620 --> 2:38:13.980
 I think it's getting people to a point

2:38:13.980 --> 2:38:18.980
 where they're sort of no longer in the reverie.

2:38:19.740 --> 2:38:21.020
 As my friend Jim Rutt says,

2:38:21.020 --> 2:38:23.700
 there's more people with ears to hear now.

2:38:23.700 --> 2:38:26.100
 With the pandemic and education,

2:38:26.100 --> 2:38:27.140
 everyone's like, wait, wait,

2:38:27.140 --> 2:38:28.820
 what have you guys been doing with my kids?

2:38:28.820 --> 2:38:30.140
 How are you teaching them?

2:38:30.140 --> 2:38:32.420
 What is this crap you're giving them as homework?

2:38:32.420 --> 2:38:33.940
 So I think these are the kinds of things

2:38:33.940 --> 2:38:36.860
 that are getting, and the supply chain disruptions,

2:38:36.860 --> 2:38:38.220
 getting more people to think about,

2:38:38.220 --> 2:38:40.200
 how do we actually just make stuff?

2:38:40.200 --> 2:38:44.820
 This is all good, but the concern is that

2:38:44.820 --> 2:38:48.380
 it's still gonna take a while for these things,

2:38:48.380 --> 2:38:50.620
 for people to learn how to be agentic again,

2:38:51.860 --> 2:38:53.920
 and to be in right relationship with each other

2:38:53.920 --> 2:38:55.860
 and with the world.

2:38:55.860 --> 2:38:58.420
 So the message of hope is still people are resilient,

2:38:58.420 --> 2:39:01.380
 and we are building some really amazing technology.

2:39:01.380 --> 2:39:03.920
 And I also, to me, I derive a lot of hope

2:39:03.920 --> 2:39:08.140
 from individuals in that van.

2:39:08.140 --> 2:39:11.980
 The power of a single individual to transform the world,

2:39:11.980 --> 2:39:14.700
 to do positive things for the world is quite incredible.

2:39:14.700 --> 2:39:16.000
 Now you've been talking about,

2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:18.860
 it's nice to have as many of those individuals as possible,

2:39:18.860 --> 2:39:21.900
 but even the power of one, it's kind of magical.

2:39:21.900 --> 2:39:22.740
 It is, it is.

2:39:22.740 --> 2:39:24.500
 We're in a mode now where we can do that.

2:39:24.500 --> 2:39:26.960
 I think also, part of what I try to do

2:39:26.960 --> 2:39:29.020
 is in coming to podcasts like yours,

2:39:29.020 --> 2:39:31.740
 and then spamming with all this philosophical stuff

2:39:31.740 --> 2:39:33.540
 that I've got going on,

2:39:33.540 --> 2:39:34.800
 there are a lot of good people out there

2:39:34.800 --> 2:39:39.800
 trying to put words around the current technological,

2:39:40.060 --> 2:39:43.220
 social, economic crises that we're facing.

2:39:43.220 --> 2:39:44.580
 And in the space of a few short years,

2:39:44.580 --> 2:39:46.340
 I think there has been a lot of great content

2:39:46.340 --> 2:39:47.620
 produced around this stuff.

2:39:47.620 --> 2:39:50.660
 For people who wanna see, wanna find out more,

2:39:50.660 --> 2:39:52.140
 or think more about this,

2:39:52.140 --> 2:39:54.540
 we're popularizing certain kinds of philosophical ideas

2:39:54.540 --> 2:39:56.580
 that move people beyond just the,

2:39:56.580 --> 2:39:58.700
 oh, you're communist, oh, you're capitalist kind of stuff.

2:39:58.700 --> 2:40:01.200
 Like it's sort of, we're way past that now.

2:40:01.200 --> 2:40:03.400
 So that also gives me hope,

2:40:03.400 --> 2:40:05.700
 that I feel like I myself am getting a handle

2:40:05.700 --> 2:40:07.500
 on how to think about these things.

2:40:08.460 --> 2:40:09.940
 It makes me feel like I can,

2:40:09.940 --> 2:40:12.560
 hopefully affect change for the better.

2:40:12.560 --> 2:40:15.700
 We've been sneaking up on this question all over the place.

2:40:15.700 --> 2:40:17.580
 Let me ask the big, ridiculous question.

2:40:17.580 --> 2:40:20.380
 What is the meaning of life?

2:40:20.380 --> 2:40:21.220
 Wow.

2:40:23.900 --> 2:40:25.260
 The meaning of life.

2:40:28.860 --> 2:40:29.700
 Yeah, I don't know.

2:40:29.700 --> 2:40:32.060
 I mean, I've never really understood that question.

2:40:32.060 --> 2:40:34.700
 When you say meaning crisis,

2:40:34.700 --> 2:40:39.700
 you're saying that there is a search

2:40:39.860 --> 2:40:42.300
 for a kind of experience

2:40:42.300 --> 2:40:45.480
 that could be described as fulfillment,

2:40:45.480 --> 2:40:50.180
 as like the aha moment of just like joy,

2:40:50.180 --> 2:40:53.400
 and maybe when you see something beautiful,

2:40:53.400 --> 2:40:55.220
 or maybe you have created something beautiful,

2:40:55.220 --> 2:40:57.200
 that experience that you get,

2:40:57.200 --> 2:41:01.700
 it feels like it all makes sense.

2:41:02.600 --> 2:41:04.340
 So some of that is just chemicals coming together

2:41:04.340 --> 2:41:06.420
 in your mind and all those kinds of things.

2:41:06.420 --> 2:41:08.820
 But it seems like we're building

2:41:08.820 --> 2:41:12.620
 a sophisticated collective intelligence

2:41:12.620 --> 2:41:15.300
 that's providing meaning in all kinds of ways

2:41:15.300 --> 2:41:17.120
 to its members.

2:41:17.120 --> 2:41:20.620
 And there's a theme to that meaning.

2:41:20.620 --> 2:41:22.860
 So for a lot of history,

2:41:22.860 --> 2:41:26.620
 I think faith played an important role.

2:41:26.620 --> 2:41:29.660
 Faith in God, sort of religion.

2:41:29.660 --> 2:41:32.660
 I think technology in the modern era

2:41:32.660 --> 2:41:34.740
 is kind of serving a little bit

2:41:34.740 --> 2:41:36.120
 of a source of meaning for people,

2:41:36.120 --> 2:41:37.920
 like innovation of different kinds.

2:41:39.580 --> 2:41:43.500
 I think the old school things of love

2:41:43.500 --> 2:41:46.500
 and the basics of just being good at stuff.

2:41:47.480 --> 2:41:50.300
 But you were a physicist,

2:41:50.300 --> 2:41:52.580
 so there's a desire to say, okay, yeah,

2:41:52.580 --> 2:41:56.300
 but these seem to be like symptoms of something deeper.

2:41:56.300 --> 2:41:57.140
 Right.

2:41:57.140 --> 2:41:57.960
 Like why?

2:41:57.960 --> 2:41:59.060
 A little meaning, what's capital M meaning?

2:41:59.060 --> 2:42:00.960
 Yeah, what's capital M meaning?

2:42:00.960 --> 2:42:03.080
 Why are we reaching for order

2:42:03.080 --> 2:42:05.120
 when there is excess of energy?

2:42:06.940 --> 2:42:09.340
 I don't know if I can answer the why.

2:42:09.340 --> 2:42:11.840
 Any why that I come up with, I think, is gonna be,

2:42:13.700 --> 2:42:15.500
 I'd have to think about that a little more,

2:42:15.500 --> 2:42:17.040
 maybe get back to you on that.

2:42:17.040 --> 2:42:18.240
 But I will say this.

2:42:19.260 --> 2:42:22.280
 We do look at the world through a traditional,

2:42:22.280 --> 2:42:24.220
 I think most people look at the world through

2:42:24.220 --> 2:42:25.980
 what I would say is a subject object

2:42:25.980 --> 2:42:27.200
 to kind of metaphysical lens,

2:42:27.200 --> 2:42:29.620
 that we have our own subjectivity,

2:42:29.620 --> 2:42:34.220
 and then there's all of these object things that are not us.

2:42:34.220 --> 2:42:37.220
 So I'm me, and these things are not me, right?

2:42:37.220 --> 2:42:39.880
 And I'm interacting with them, I'm doing things to them.

2:42:39.880 --> 2:42:41.380
 But a different view of the world

2:42:41.380 --> 2:42:44.220
 that looks at it as much more connected,

2:42:44.220 --> 2:42:49.220
 that realizes, oh, I'm really quite embedded

2:42:49.220 --> 2:42:50.680
 in a soup of other things,

2:42:50.680 --> 2:42:54.060
 and I'm simply almost like a standing wave pattern

2:42:54.060 --> 2:42:55.920
 of different things, right?

2:42:55.920 --> 2:42:58.020
 So when you look at the world

2:42:58.020 --> 2:42:59.140
 in that kind of connected sense,

2:42:59.140 --> 2:43:02.980
 I've recently taken a shine

2:43:02.980 --> 2:43:04.540
 to this particular thought experiment,

2:43:04.540 --> 2:43:07.260
 which is what if it was the case

2:43:08.560 --> 2:43:12.380
 that everything that we touch with our hands,

2:43:12.380 --> 2:43:13.880
 that we pay attention to,

2:43:13.880 --> 2:43:16.300
 that we actually give intimacy to,

2:43:16.300 --> 2:43:21.300
 what if there's actually all the mumbo jumbo,

2:43:21.300 --> 2:43:25.100
 like people with the magnetic healing crystals

2:43:25.100 --> 2:43:28.240
 and all this other kind of stuff and quantum energy stuff,

2:43:28.240 --> 2:43:30.340
 what if that was a thing?

2:43:30.340 --> 2:43:34.140
 What if literally when your hand touches an object,

2:43:34.140 --> 2:43:35.420
 when you really look at something

2:43:35.420 --> 2:43:36.840
 and you concentrate and you focus on it

2:43:36.840 --> 2:43:39.020
 and you really give it attention,

2:43:39.020 --> 2:43:40.580
 you actually give it,

2:43:40.580 --> 2:43:44.240
 there is some physical residue of something,

2:43:44.240 --> 2:43:48.120
 a part of you, a bit of your life force that goes into it.

2:43:48.120 --> 2:43:51.500
 Okay, now this is of course completely mumbo jumbo stuff.

2:43:51.500 --> 2:43:53.680
 This is not like, I don't actually think this is real,

2:43:53.680 --> 2:43:55.640
 but let's do the thought experiment.

2:43:55.640 --> 2:43:57.720
 What if it was?

2:43:57.720 --> 2:44:01.720
 What if there actually was some quantum magnetic crystal

2:44:01.720 --> 2:44:05.320
 and energy field thing that just by touching this can,

2:44:05.320 --> 2:44:08.920
 this can has changed a little bit somehow.

2:44:08.920 --> 2:44:11.940
 And it's not much unless you put a lot into it

2:44:11.940 --> 2:44:15.000
 and you touch it all the time, like your phone, right?

2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:18.340
 These things gained, they gain meaning to you a little bit,

2:44:19.640 --> 2:44:22.440
 but what if there's something that,

2:44:23.520 --> 2:44:25.240
 technical objects, the phone is a technical object,

2:44:25.240 --> 2:44:29.160
 it does not really receive attention or intimacy

2:44:29.160 --> 2:44:31.980
 and then allow itself to be transformed by it.

2:44:31.980 --> 2:44:33.360
 But if it's a piece of wood,

2:44:33.360 --> 2:44:36.720
 if it's the handle of a knife that your mother used

2:44:36.720 --> 2:44:40.340
 for 20 years to make dinner for you, right?

2:44:40.340 --> 2:44:43.860
 What if it's a keyboard that you banged out,

2:44:43.860 --> 2:44:46.400
 your world transforming software library on?

2:44:46.400 --> 2:44:47.840
 These are technical objects

2:44:47.840 --> 2:44:48.780
 and these are physical objects,

2:44:48.780 --> 2:44:51.400
 but somehow there's something to them.

2:44:51.400 --> 2:44:53.320
 We feel an attraction to these objects

2:44:53.320 --> 2:44:56.980
 as if we have imbued them with life energy, right?

2:44:56.980 --> 2:44:58.760
 So if you walk that thought experiment through,

2:44:58.760 --> 2:45:00.440
 what happens when we touch another person,

2:45:00.440 --> 2:45:02.200
 when we hug them, when we hold them?

2:45:03.160 --> 2:45:07.800
 And the reason this ties into my answer for your question

2:45:07.800 --> 2:45:12.800
 is that if there is such a thing,

2:45:12.800 --> 2:45:13.680
 if there is such a thing,

2:45:13.680 --> 2:45:15.660
 if we were to hypothesize, you know,

2:45:15.660 --> 2:45:17.160
 hypothesize it's such a thing,

2:45:18.480 --> 2:45:23.440
 it could be that the purpose of our lives

2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:27.580
 is to imbue as many things with that love as possible.

2:45:30.640 --> 2:45:32.820
 That's a beautiful answer

2:45:32.820 --> 2:45:35.240
 and a beautiful way to end it, Peter.

2:45:35.240 --> 2:45:36.600
 You're an incredible person.

2:45:36.600 --> 2:45:37.440
 Thank you.

2:45:37.440 --> 2:45:41.520
 Spanning so much in the space of engineering

2:45:41.520 --> 2:45:43.360
 and in the space of philosophy.

2:45:44.760 --> 2:45:49.000
 I'm really proud to be living in the same city as you

2:45:49.000 --> 2:45:51.120
 and I'm really grateful

2:45:51.120 --> 2:45:53.000
 that you would spend your valuable time with me today.

2:45:53.000 --> 2:45:53.840
 Thank you so much.

2:45:53.840 --> 2:45:54.660
 Well, thank you.

2:45:54.660 --> 2:45:56.560
 I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you.

2:45:56.560 --> 2:45:59.240
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Peter Wang.

2:45:59.240 --> 2:46:00.600

 And now let me leave you with some words

2:46:05.680 --> 2:46:07.960
 from Peter Wang himself.

2:46:07.960 --> 2:46:09.480
 We tend to think of people

2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:12.480
 as either malicious or incompetent,

2:46:12.480 --> 2:46:15.200
 but in a world filled with corruptible

2:46:15.200 --> 2:46:17.120
 and unchecked institutions,

2:46:17.120 --> 2:46:21.080
 there exists a third thing, malicious incompetence.

2:46:21.080 --> 2:46:22.620
 It's a social cancer

2:46:22.620 --> 2:46:26.000
 and it only appears once human organizations scale

2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:27.840
 beyond personal accountability.

2:46:27.840 --> 2:46:40.260
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
