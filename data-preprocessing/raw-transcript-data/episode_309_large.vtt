WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
 I remember the reaction where he had drawn these characters

00:02.560 --> 00:04.200
 and he was slowly moving around

00:04.200 --> 00:06.960
 and like people had no experience with 3D navigation.

00:06.960 --> 00:07.920
 It was all still keyboard.

00:07.920 --> 00:10.960
 We didn't even have mice set up at that time,

00:10.960 --> 00:14.740
 but slowly moving, going up, picked up a key, go to a wall.

00:14.740 --> 00:16.800
 The wall disappears in a little animation

00:16.800 --> 00:18.760
 and there's a monster like right there.

00:18.760 --> 00:20.440
 And he practically fell out of his chair.

00:20.440 --> 00:24.680
 It was just like, ah, and games just didn't do that.

00:24.680 --> 00:26.800
 You know, the games were the God's eye view.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.760
 You were a little invested in your little guy.

00:28.760 --> 00:32.200
 You can be like, you know, happy or sad when things happen,

00:32.200 --> 00:34.880
 but you just did not get that kind of startled reaction.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.360
 You weren't inside the game.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.000
 Something in the back of your brain,

00:38.000 --> 00:40.200
 some reptile brain thing is just going,

00:40.200 --> 00:42.400
 oh shit, something just happened.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.960
 And that was one of those early points where it's like,

00:44.960 --> 00:47.240
 yeah, this is going to make a difference.

00:47.240 --> 00:50.020
 This is going to be powerful and it's going to matter.

00:52.300 --> 00:55.140
 The following is a conversation with John Carmack,

00:55.140 --> 00:58.520
 widely considered to be one of the greatest programmers

00:58.520 --> 00:59.520
 ever.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.960
 He was the cofounder of id Software

01:01.960 --> 01:03.880
 and the lead programmer on several games

01:03.880 --> 01:07.360
 that revolutionized the technology, the experience,

01:07.360 --> 01:09.800
 and the role of gaming in our society,

01:09.800 --> 01:14.800
 including Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, and Quake.

01:15.800 --> 01:19.960
 He spent many years as the CTO of Oculus VR,

01:19.960 --> 01:23.080
 helping to create portals into virtual worlds

01:23.080 --> 01:25.480
 and to define the technological path

01:25.480 --> 01:28.120
 to the metaverse and meta.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.960
 And now he has been shifting some of his attention

01:30.960 --> 01:34.840
 to the problem of artificial general intelligence.

01:34.840 --> 01:38.400
 This was the longest conversation on this podcast

01:38.400 --> 01:40.080
 at over five hours.

01:40.080 --> 01:43.720
 And still, I could talk to John many, many more times,

01:43.720 --> 01:45.580
 and we hope to do just that.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.680
 This is the Lux Readman podcast.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.840
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:50.840 --> 01:52.160
 in the description.

01:52.160 --> 01:56.360
 And now, dear friends, here's John Carmack.

01:56.360 --> 02:00.040
 What was the first program you've ever written?

02:00.040 --> 02:01.200
 Do you remember?

02:01.200 --> 02:02.040
 Yeah, I do.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.400
 So I remember being in a radio shack

02:04.400 --> 02:06.800
 going up to the TRS 80 computers

02:06.800 --> 02:09.840
 and learning just enough to be able to do

02:09.840 --> 02:12.760
 10 print John Carmack.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.960
 And it's kind of interesting how, of course,

02:15.960 --> 02:19.040
 Carnegie and Ritchie kind of standardized Hello World

02:19.040 --> 02:20.040
 as the first thing that you do

02:20.040 --> 02:22.720
 in every computer programming language in every computer,

02:22.720 --> 02:24.800
 but not having any interaction

02:24.800 --> 02:28.200
 with the cultures of Unix or any other standardized things.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.840
 It was just like, well, what am I gonna say?

02:29.840 --> 02:30.960
 I'm gonna say my name.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.160
 And then you learn how to do go to 10

02:33.160 --> 02:34.920
 and have it scroll all off the screen.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.280
 And that was definitely the first thing

02:37.280 --> 02:39.520
 that I wound up doing on a computer.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.280
 Can I ask you a programming advice?

02:41.280 --> 02:42.680
 I was always told in the beginning

02:42.680 --> 02:44.360
 that you're not allowed to use go to statements.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.520
 That's really bad programming.

02:45.520 --> 02:46.920
 Is this correct or not?

02:46.920 --> 02:50.280
 Jumping around code, can we look at the philosophy

02:50.280 --> 02:53.680
 and the technical aspects of the go to statement

02:53.680 --> 02:55.120
 that seems so convenient,

02:55.120 --> 02:55.960
 but it's supposed to be bad programming?

02:55.960 --> 02:57.280
 Well, so certainly back in the day

02:57.280 --> 02:58.920
 in basic programming languages,

02:58.920 --> 03:00.760
 you didn't have proper loops.

03:00.760 --> 03:02.720
 You didn't have four whiles and repeats.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.840
 That was the land of Pascal for people

03:04.840 --> 03:07.360
 that kind of generally had access to it back then.

03:07.360 --> 03:10.360
 So you had no choice but to use go tos.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.440
 And as you made what were big programs back then,

03:13.440 --> 03:15.560
 which were a thousand line basic program

03:15.560 --> 03:16.720
 is a really big program.

03:16.720 --> 03:19.960
 They did tend to sort of degenerate into madness.

03:19.960 --> 03:23.360
 You didn't have good editors or code exploration tools.

03:23.360 --> 03:26.160
 So you would wind up fixing things in one place,

03:26.160 --> 03:27.120
 add a little patch.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.680
 And there's reasons why structured programming

03:29.680 --> 03:31.720
 generally helps understanding,

03:31.720 --> 03:33.800
 but go tos aren't poisonous.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.920
 Sometimes they're the right thing to do.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.840
 Usually it's because there's a language feature missing

03:38.840 --> 03:40.520
 like nested breaks or something

03:40.520 --> 03:44.560
 where it can sometimes be better to do a go to cleanup

03:44.560 --> 03:48.040
 or go to error rather than having multiple flags,

03:48.040 --> 03:50.440
 multiple if statements littered throughout things.

03:50.440 --> 03:51.800
 But it is rare.

03:51.800 --> 03:55.120
 I mean, if you gripped through all of my code right now,

03:55.120 --> 03:57.520
 I don't think any of my current code bases

03:57.520 --> 03:58.960
 would actually have a go to,

03:58.960 --> 04:02.640
 but deep within sort of the technical underpinnings

04:02.640 --> 04:03.720
 of a major game engine,

04:03.720 --> 04:07.200
 you're gonna have some go tos in a couple of places probably.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.160
 Yeah, the infrastructure on top of,

04:09.160 --> 04:11.240
 like the closer you get to machine code,

04:11.240 --> 04:12.680
 the more go tos you're gonna see,

04:12.680 --> 04:15.640
 the more of these like hacks you're going to see

04:15.640 --> 04:18.240
 because the set of features available to you

04:18.240 --> 04:22.360
 in low level programming languages is not, is limited.

04:22.360 --> 04:25.920
 So print John Carmack,

04:25.920 --> 04:28.360
 when is the first time,

04:28.360 --> 04:30.000
 if we could talk about love,

04:30.000 --> 04:31.680
 that you fell in love with programming?

04:31.680 --> 04:34.640
 You said like, this is really something special.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.040
 It really was something

04:36.040 --> 04:38.120
 that was one of those love at first sight things

04:38.120 --> 04:39.920
 where just really from the time

04:39.920 --> 04:42.720
 that I understood what a computer was even,

04:42.720 --> 04:45.440
 I mean, I remember looking through old encyclopedias

04:45.440 --> 04:48.560
 of the black and white photos of the IBM mainframes

04:48.560 --> 04:50.240
 at the reel to reel tape decks.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.320
 And for people nowadays,

04:52.320 --> 04:53.800
 it can be a little hard to understand

04:53.800 --> 04:56.280
 what the world was like then from information gathering

04:56.280 --> 04:58.720
 where I would go to the libraries

04:58.720 --> 05:01.080
 and there would be a couple books on the shelf

05:01.080 --> 05:03.880
 about computers and they would be very out of date

05:03.880 --> 05:06.640
 even at that point, just not a lot of information,

05:06.640 --> 05:09.160
 but I would grab everything that I could find

05:09.160 --> 05:10.560
 and devour everything.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.200
 Whenever Time or Newsweek had some article about computers,

05:14.200 --> 05:16.960
 I would like cut it out with scissors and put it somewhere.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.960
 It just, it felt like this magical thing to me,

05:19.960 --> 05:23.480
 this idea that the computer would just do exactly

05:23.480 --> 05:24.480
 what you told it to.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.640
 I mean, and there's a little bit of the genie monkey's paw

05:26.640 --> 05:28.960
 sort of issues there where you'd better be really,

05:28.960 --> 05:31.080
 really careful with what you're telling it to do,

05:31.080 --> 05:33.120
 but it wasn't gonna back talk you.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.720
 It wasn't gonna have a different point of view.

05:34.720 --> 05:37.400
 It was gonna carry out what you told it to do.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.840
 And if you had the right commands,

05:39.840 --> 05:43.560
 you could make it do these pretty magical things.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.000
 And so what kind of programs did you write at first?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.280
 So beyond the print, John Carmack.

05:48.280 --> 05:51.800
 So I can remember as going through the learning process

05:51.800 --> 05:53.720
 where you find at the start,

05:53.720 --> 05:54.600
 you're just learning how to do

05:54.600 --> 05:56.400
 the most basic possible things.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.840
 And I can remember stuff like a Superman comic

05:59.840 --> 06:02.640
 that RadioShack commissioned to have,

06:02.640 --> 06:04.840
 it's like Superman had lost some of his super brain

06:04.840 --> 06:07.520
 and kids had to use RadioShack TRS 80 computers

06:07.520 --> 06:09.920
 to do calculations for it to help him

06:09.920 --> 06:11.960
 kind of complete his heroics.

06:11.960 --> 06:15.240
 And I'd find little things like that

06:15.240 --> 06:17.320
 and then get a few basic books

06:17.320 --> 06:20.120
 to be able to kind of work my way up.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.440
 And again, it was so precious back then.

06:22.440 --> 06:23.640
 I had a couple of books

06:23.640 --> 06:25.920
 that would teach me important things about it.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.640
 I had one book that I could start to learn

06:28.640 --> 06:30.320
 a little bit of assembly language from,

06:30.320 --> 06:32.000
 and I'd have a few books on basic

06:32.000 --> 06:34.560
 and some things that I could get from the libraries.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.160
 But my goals in the early days

06:37.160 --> 06:40.000
 was almost always making games of various kinds.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.880
 I loved the arcade games and the early Atari 2600 games.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.720
 And being able to do some of those things myself

06:47.720 --> 06:51.360
 on the computers was very much what I aspired to.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.000
 And it was a whole journey where

06:53.000 --> 06:54.360
 if you learn normal basic,

06:54.360 --> 06:56.080
 you can't do any kind of an action game.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.400
 You can write an adventure game.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.360
 You can write things where you say, what do you do here?

07:00.360 --> 07:03.600
 I get sword attack troll, that type of thing.

07:03.600 --> 07:07.040
 And that can be done in the context of basic.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.520
 But to do things that had moving graphics,

07:09.520 --> 07:11.280
 there were only the most limited things

07:11.280 --> 07:12.240
 you could possibly do.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.040
 You could maybe do breakout or pong

07:14.040 --> 07:16.920
 or that sort of thing in low resolution graphics.

07:16.920 --> 07:20.720
 And in fact, one of my first sort of major technical hacks

07:20.720 --> 07:25.400
 that I was kind of fond of was on the Apple II computers,

07:25.400 --> 07:28.800
 they had a mode called low resolution graphics

07:28.800 --> 07:31.400
 where of course all graphics were low resolution back then,

07:31.400 --> 07:34.080
 but regular low resolution graphics,

07:34.080 --> 07:37.160
 it was a grid of 40 by 40 pixels normally,

07:37.160 --> 07:39.480
 but they could have 16 different colors.

07:39.480 --> 07:42.080
 And I wanted to make a game kind of like

07:42.080 --> 07:44.920
 the arcade game Vanguard, just a scrolling game.

07:44.920 --> 07:47.400
 And I wanted to just kind of have it scroll vertically up.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.240
 And I could move a little ship around.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.760
 You could manage to do that in basic,

07:50.760 --> 07:53.520
 but there's no way you could redraw the whole screen.

07:53.520 --> 07:56.000
 And I remember at the time just coming up

07:56.000 --> 07:58.160
 with what felt like a brainstorm to me

07:58.160 --> 08:02.000
 where I knew enough about the way the hardware was controlled

08:02.000 --> 08:05.120
 where the text screen and the low resolution graphics screen

08:05.120 --> 08:06.880
 were basically the same thing.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.640
 And all those computers could scroll their text screen

08:09.640 --> 08:10.240
 reasonably.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.680
 You could do a listing and it would scroll things up.

08:12.680 --> 08:16.480
 And I figured out that I could kind of tweak just a couple

08:16.480 --> 08:19.640
 things that I barely understood to put it into a graphics mode

08:19.640 --> 08:21.600
 and I could draw graphics and then I could just

08:21.600 --> 08:24.360
 do a line feed at the very bottom of the screen.

08:24.360 --> 08:26.320
 And then the system would scroll it all up

08:26.320 --> 08:28.080
 using an assembly language routine

08:28.080 --> 08:30.200
 that I didn't know how to write back then.

08:30.200 --> 08:33.360
 So that was like this first great hack

08:33.360 --> 08:36.040
 that sort of had analogs later on in my career

08:36.040 --> 08:37.240
 for a lot of different things.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.400
 So I found out that I could draw a screen.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.920
 I could do a line feed at the bottom.

08:40.920 --> 08:42.160
 It would scroll it up once.

08:42.160 --> 08:44.720
 I could draw a couple more lines of stuff at the bottom.

08:44.720 --> 08:47.240
 And that was my first way to kind of scroll

08:47.240 --> 08:50.680
 the screen, which was interesting in that that played

08:50.680 --> 08:53.280
 a big part later on in the id Software days as well.

08:53.280 --> 08:57.480
 So do efficient drawing where you

08:57.480 --> 08:59.200
 don't have to draw the whole screen,

08:59.200 --> 09:01.120
 but you draw from the bottom using

09:01.120 --> 09:04.520
 the thing that was designed in the hardware for text output.

09:04.520 --> 09:05.160
 Yeah.

09:05.160 --> 09:08.960
 Where so much of, until recently,

09:08.960 --> 09:12.120
 game design was limited by what you could actually

09:12.120 --> 09:13.200
 get the computer to do.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.000
 Where it's easy to say, OK, I want to scroll the screen.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.400
 You just redraw the entire screen at a slight offset.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.560
 And nowadays, that works just fine.

09:21.560 --> 09:24.680
 Computers are ludicrously fast.

09:24.680 --> 09:28.040
 But up until a decade ago or so, there

09:28.040 --> 09:30.120
 were all these things everybody wanted to do.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.880
 But if they knew enough programming

09:31.880 --> 09:34.960
 to be able to make it happen, it would happen too slow

09:34.960 --> 09:36.440
 to be a good experience.

09:36.440 --> 09:39.320
 Either just ridiculously slow or just slow enough

09:39.320 --> 09:42.040
 that it wasn't fun to experience it like that.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.600
 So much of the first couple of decades of the programming work

09:45.600 --> 09:47.760
 that I did was largely figuring out

09:47.760 --> 09:49.200
 how to do something that everybody

09:49.200 --> 09:51.520
 knows how they want it to happen.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.240
 It just has to happen 2 to 10 times faster

09:54.240 --> 09:57.360
 than the straightforward way of doing things

09:57.360 --> 09:58.680
 would make it happen.

09:58.680 --> 10:02.560
 And it's different now because at this point, lots of things

10:02.560 --> 10:05.000
 you can just do in the most naive possible way,

10:05.000 --> 10:06.520
 and it still works out.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.520
 You don't have nearly the creative limitations

10:09.520 --> 10:12.680
 or the incentives for optimizing on that level.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.520
 And there's a lot of pros and cons to that.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.520
 But I do generally, I'm not going

10:16.520 --> 10:20.000
 to do the angry old man shaking my fist at the clouds bit

10:20.000 --> 10:21.560
 where back in my day, programmers

10:21.560 --> 10:23.200
 had to do real programming.

10:23.200 --> 10:26.640
 It's amazing that you can just pick an idea

10:26.640 --> 10:27.840
 and go do it right now.

10:27.840 --> 10:30.520
 And you don't have to be some assembly language wizard

10:30.520 --> 10:33.840
 or deep GPU arcanist to be able to figure out

10:33.840 --> 10:35.160
 how to make your wishes happen.

10:35.160 --> 10:38.400
 Well, there's still, see, that's true.

10:38.400 --> 10:41.320
 But let me put on my old man with a fist hat

10:41.320 --> 10:45.200
 and say that probably the thing that will define the future

10:45.200 --> 10:48.720
 still requires you to operate at the limits

10:48.720 --> 10:49.720
 of the current system.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.880
 So we'll probably talk about this.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.440
 But if you talk about building the metaverse

10:54.440 --> 10:57.120
 and building a VR experience that's compelling,

10:57.120 --> 11:01.280
 it probably requires you to not, to go to assembly

11:01.280 --> 11:05.840
 or maybe not literally, but sort of spiritually

11:05.840 --> 11:08.360
 to go to the limits of what the system is capable of.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.840
 And that really was why virtual reality

11:10.840 --> 11:13.640
 was specifically interesting to me

11:13.640 --> 11:15.000
 where it had all the ties to,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.080
 you could say that even back in the early days,

11:17.080 --> 11:19.160
 I have some old magazine articles

11:19.160 --> 11:22.160
 that's talking about Doom as a virtual reality experience

11:22.160 --> 11:25.200
 back when just seeing anything in 3D.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.320
 So you could say that we've been trying to build

11:27.320 --> 11:29.640
 those virtual experiences from the very beginning.

11:29.640 --> 11:32.840
 And in the modern era of virtual reality,

11:32.840 --> 11:34.800
 especially on the mobile side of things,

11:34.800 --> 11:36.680
 when it's standalone and you're basically using

11:36.680 --> 11:39.000
 a cell phone chip to be able to produce

11:39.000 --> 11:41.800
 these very immersive experiences,

11:41.800 --> 11:43.640
 it does require work.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.720
 It's not at the level of what an old school

11:45.720 --> 11:48.480
 console game programmer would have operated at

11:48.480 --> 11:50.320
 where you're looking at hardware registers

11:50.320 --> 11:53.520
 and you're scheduling all the DMA accesses,

11:53.520 --> 11:55.520
 but it is still definitely a different level

11:55.520 --> 12:00.160
 than what a web developer or even a PC Steam game developer

12:00.160 --> 12:01.760
 usually has to work at.

12:01.760 --> 12:02.840
 And again, it's great.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.920
 There's opportunities for people that wanna operate

12:04.920 --> 12:06.400
 at either end of that spectrum there

12:06.400 --> 12:08.640
 and still provide a lot of value to the world.

12:09.560 --> 12:14.560
 Let me ask you sort of a big question about preference.

12:15.560 --> 12:19.920
 What would you say is the best programming language?

12:19.920 --> 12:22.560
 Your favorite, but also the best.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.160
 You've seen throughout your career,

12:25.160 --> 12:26.960
 you're considered by many to be

12:26.960 --> 12:29.440
 the greatest programmer ever.

12:29.440 --> 12:32.320
 I mean, it's so difficult to place that label on anyone,

12:32.320 --> 12:34.000
 but if you put it on anyone, it's you.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.380
 So let me ask you these kind of ridiculous questions

12:36.380 --> 12:38.760
 of what's the best band of all time,

12:38.760 --> 12:41.520
 but in your case, what's the best programming language?

12:41.520 --> 12:43.520
 Everything has all the caveats about it.

12:43.520 --> 12:47.480
 But so what I use, so nowadays I do program

12:47.480 --> 12:52.480
 a reasonable amount of Python for AI, ML sorts of work.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.440
 I'm not a native Python programmer.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.000
 It's something I came to very late in my career.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.800
 I understand what it's good for.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.080
 But you don't dream in Python.

13:00.080 --> 13:00.920
 I do not.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.380
 And it has some of those things

13:02.380 --> 13:04.800
 where there's some amazing stats when you say,

13:04.800 --> 13:07.160
 if you just start, if you make a loop,

13:07.160 --> 13:10.980
 a triply nested loop and start doing operations in Python,

13:10.980 --> 13:14.840
 you can be thousands to potentially a million times slower

13:14.840 --> 13:17.600
 than a proper GPU tensor operation.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.800
 And these are staggering numbers.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.800
 You can be as much slower as we've almost gotten faster

13:22.800 --> 13:26.920
 in our pace of progress and all this other miraculous stuff.

13:26.920 --> 13:28.840
 So your intuitions about inefficiencies

13:28.840 --> 13:30.200
 within the Python sort of...

13:30.200 --> 13:32.080
 It keeps hitting me upside the face

13:32.080 --> 13:34.160
 where it's gotten to the point now I understand.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.840
 It's like, okay, you just can't do a loop

13:35.840 --> 13:38.480
 if you care about performance in Python.

13:38.480 --> 13:41.380
 You have to figure out how you can reformat this

13:41.380 --> 13:43.100
 into some big vector operation

13:43.100 --> 13:44.920
 or something that's going to be done completely

13:44.920 --> 13:47.080
 within a C++ library.

13:47.080 --> 13:49.920
 But the other hand is it's amazingly convenient

13:49.920 --> 13:52.320
 and you just see stuff that people are able

13:52.320 --> 13:54.560
 to cobble together by you just import

13:54.560 --> 13:56.460
 a few different things and you can do stuff

13:56.460 --> 13:58.880
 that nobody on earth could do 10 years ago.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.520
 And you can do it in a little cookbook thing

14:00.520 --> 14:02.840
 that you copy paste it out of a website.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.820
 So that is really great.

14:04.820 --> 14:06.960
 When I'm sitting down to do what I consider

14:06.960 --> 14:10.440
 kind of serious programming, it's still in C++.

14:10.440 --> 14:13.960
 And it's really kind of a C flavored C++ at that

14:13.960 --> 14:17.160
 where I'm not big into the modern template

14:17.160 --> 14:18.780
 metaprogramming sorts of things.

14:18.780 --> 14:21.280
 I see a lot of train wrecks coming from

14:21.280 --> 14:23.500
 some of that over abstraction.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.800
 I spent a few years really going kind of deep

14:26.800 --> 14:30.120
 into the kind of the historical Lisp work

14:30.120 --> 14:32.320
 and Haskell and some of the functional programming

14:32.320 --> 14:33.360
 sides of things.

14:33.360 --> 14:37.040
 And there is a lot of value there

14:37.040 --> 14:38.700
 in the way you think about things.

14:38.700 --> 14:42.160
 And I changed a lot of the way I write my C and C++ code

14:42.160 --> 14:44.960
 based on what I learned about the value

14:44.960 --> 14:48.080
 that comes out of not having this random mutable state

14:48.080 --> 14:50.240
 that you kind of lose track of.

14:50.240 --> 14:53.640
 Because something that many people don't really appreciate

14:53.640 --> 14:55.500
 till they've been at it for a long time

14:55.500 --> 14:58.240
 is that it's not the writing of the program initially,

14:58.240 --> 15:00.440
 it's the whole lifespan of the program.

15:00.440 --> 15:02.680
 And that's when it's not necessarily just

15:02.680 --> 15:05.500
 how fast you wrote it or how fast it operates,

15:05.500 --> 15:07.720
 but it's how can it bend and adapt

15:07.720 --> 15:09.240
 as situations change.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.160
 And then the thing that I've really been learning

15:11.160 --> 15:14.720
 in my time at Meta with the Oculus and VR work

15:14.720 --> 15:16.960
 is it's also how well it hands off

15:16.960 --> 15:19.960
 between the continuous kind of revolving door of programmers

15:19.960 --> 15:21.960
 taking over maintenance and different things

15:21.960 --> 15:24.600
 and how you get people up to speed in different areas.

15:24.600 --> 15:27.140
 And there's all these other different aspects of it.

15:27.140 --> 15:32.140
 So C++ is a good language for handover between engineers.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.800
 Probably not the best.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.900
 And there's some really interesting aspects to this

15:36.900 --> 15:39.360
 where in some cases languages

15:39.360 --> 15:43.460
 that are not generally thought well of for many reasons,

15:43.460 --> 15:46.400
 like C is derided pretty broadly that yes,

15:46.400 --> 15:48.160
 obviously all of these security flaws

15:48.160 --> 15:50.400
 that happen with the memory and unsafeness

15:50.400 --> 15:53.920
 and buffer overruns and the things that you've got there,

15:53.920 --> 15:56.680
 but there is this underappreciated aspect

15:56.680 --> 15:59.560
 to the language is so simple, anyone can go.

15:59.560 --> 16:03.080
 And if you know C, you can generally jump in someplace

16:03.080 --> 16:06.140
 and not have to learn what paradigms they're using

16:06.140 --> 16:08.320
 because there just aren't that many available.

16:08.320 --> 16:12.480
 I think there's some really, really well written C code.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.520
 Like I find it great that if I'm messing around

16:15.520 --> 16:17.120
 with something in open BSD say,

16:17.120 --> 16:19.320
 I mean, I can be walking around in the kernel

16:19.320 --> 16:22.160
 and I'm like, I understand everything that's going on here.

16:22.160 --> 16:25.960
 It's not hard for me to figure out what I need to do

16:25.960 --> 16:29.760
 to make whatever change that I need to

16:29.760 --> 16:32.820
 while you can have more significant languages.

16:32.820 --> 16:34.800
 Like it's a downside of Lisp

16:34.800 --> 16:37.320
 where I don't regret the time that I spent with Lisp.

16:37.320 --> 16:40.880
 I think that it did help my thinking

16:40.880 --> 16:42.780
 about programming in some ways,

16:42.780 --> 16:45.400
 but the people that are the biggest defenders of Lisp

16:45.400 --> 16:47.840
 are saying how malleable of a language it is

16:47.840 --> 16:50.080
 that if you write a huge Lisp program,

16:50.080 --> 16:53.120
 you've basically invented your own kind of language

16:53.120 --> 16:55.440
 and structure because it's not the primitives

16:55.440 --> 16:57.000
 of the language you're using very much.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.480
 It's all of the things you've built on top of that.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.040
 And then a language like Racket,

17:01.040 --> 17:03.360
 kind of one of the more modern Lisp versions,

17:03.360 --> 17:05.320
 it's essentially touted as a language

17:05.320 --> 17:07.020
 for building other languages.

17:07.020 --> 17:10.080
 And I understand the value of that

17:10.080 --> 17:12.440
 for a tiny little project,

17:12.440 --> 17:14.800
 but the idea of that for one of these longterm

17:14.800 --> 17:18.000
 supported by lots of people kind of horrifies me

17:18.000 --> 17:20.480
 where all of those abstractions that you're like,

17:20.480 --> 17:23.920
 okay, you can't touch this code till you educate yourself

17:23.920 --> 17:26.760
 on all of these things that we've built on top of that.

17:26.760 --> 17:30.420
 And it was interesting to see how when Google made Go,

17:30.420 --> 17:33.160
 a lot of the criticisms of that are it's like,

17:33.160 --> 17:35.040
 wow, this is not a state of the art language.

17:35.040 --> 17:38.080
 This language is just so simple and almost crude.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.480
 And you could see the programming language people

17:40.480 --> 17:41.920
 just looking down at it.

17:41.920 --> 17:45.360
 But it does seem to be quite popular as basically saying,

17:45.360 --> 17:47.240
 this is the good things about C,

17:47.240 --> 17:49.360
 everybody can just jump right in and use it.

17:49.360 --> 17:52.060
 You don't need to restructure your brain

17:52.060 --> 17:53.880
 to write good code in it.

17:53.880 --> 17:56.300
 So I wish that I had more opportunity

17:56.300 --> 17:59.000
 for doing some work in Go.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.160
 Rust is the other modern language that everybody talks about

18:02.160 --> 18:04.200
 that I'm not fit to pass judgment on.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.620
 I've done a little bit beyond Hello World.

18:06.620 --> 18:09.940
 I wrote some like video decompression work in Rust

18:09.940 --> 18:12.720
 just as an exercise, but that was a few years ago

18:12.720 --> 18:15.040
 and I haven't really used it since.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.640
 The best programming language is the one that works generally

18:17.640 --> 18:19.160
 that you're currently using.

18:19.160 --> 18:22.280
 Because that's another trap is in almost every case

18:22.280 --> 18:25.000
 I've seen when people mixed languages on a project,

18:25.000 --> 18:26.060
 that's a mistake.

18:26.060 --> 18:29.000
 I would rather stay just in one language

18:29.000 --> 18:31.680
 so that everybody can work across the entire thing.

18:31.680 --> 18:34.380
 And we have, I get meta, we have a lot of projects

18:34.380 --> 18:36.400
 that use kind of React frameworks.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.900
 So you've got JavaScript here

18:37.900 --> 18:40.960
 and then you have C++ for real work.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.720
 And then you may have Java interfacing

18:42.720 --> 18:44.680
 with some other part of the Android system.

18:44.680 --> 18:47.000
 And those are all kind of horrible things.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.320
 And that was one thing that I remember talking

18:51.320 --> 18:54.640
 with Boz at Facebook about it where like,

18:54.640 --> 18:56.020
 man, I wish we could have just said,

18:56.020 --> 18:59.000
 we're only hiring C++ programmers.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.700
 And he just thought from the Facebook meta perspective,

19:02.700 --> 19:05.400
 well, we just wouldn't be able to find enough.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.040
 With the thousands of programmers they've got there,

19:08.040 --> 19:10.780
 it is not necessarily a dying breed,

19:10.780 --> 19:12.880
 but you can sure find a lot more Java

19:12.880 --> 19:14.960
 or JavaScript programmers.

19:14.960 --> 19:17.860
 And I kind of mentioned that to Elon one time

19:17.860 --> 19:21.120
 and he was kind of flabbergasted about that.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.160
 It's like, well, you just,

19:22.160 --> 19:23.960
 you go out and you find those programmers

19:23.960 --> 19:25.520
 and you don't hire the other programmers

19:25.520 --> 19:28.400
 that don't do the languages that you wanna use.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.340
 But right now, I guess, yeah,

19:29.340 --> 19:32.360
 they're using JavaScript on a bunch of the SpaceX work

19:32.360 --> 19:33.760
 for the UI side of things.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.420
 When you go find UI programmers,

19:35.420 --> 19:36.920
 they're JavaScript programmers.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.380
 I wonder if that's because there's a lot

19:38.380 --> 19:39.720
 of JavaScript programmers.

19:39.720 --> 19:44.720
 Because I do think that great programmers are rare.

19:44.720 --> 19:48.360
 That it's not, you know, if you just look at statistics

19:48.360 --> 19:51.220
 of how many people are using different programming languages,

19:51.220 --> 19:53.280
 that doesn't tell you the story

19:53.280 --> 19:55.760
 of what the great programmers are using.

19:55.760 --> 19:59.160
 And so you have to really look at what you were speaking to,

19:59.160 --> 20:00.820
 which is the fundamentals of a language.

20:00.820 --> 20:01.720
 What does it encourage?

20:01.720 --> 20:03.280
 How does it encourage you to think?

20:03.280 --> 20:05.700
 What kind of systems does it encourage you to build?

20:05.700 --> 20:07.800
 There is something about C++

20:08.780 --> 20:11.240
 that has elements of creativity,

20:11.240 --> 20:15.160
 but forces you to be an adult about your programming.

20:15.160 --> 20:16.680
 It expects you to be an adult.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.720
 It does not force you to.

20:18.720 --> 20:23.720
 And so it brings out people that are willing to be creative

20:23.720 --> 20:25.800
 in terms of building large systems

20:25.800 --> 20:27.600
 and coming up with interesting solutions,

20:27.600 --> 20:31.320
 but at the same time have the sort of the good

20:31.320 --> 20:35.320
 software engineering practices that amend themselves

20:35.320 --> 20:37.480
 to real world systems.

20:37.480 --> 20:40.360
 Let me ask you about this other language, JavaScript.

20:41.760 --> 20:46.280
 So if we, you know, aliens visit in thousands of years,

20:46.280 --> 20:49.560
 and humans are long gone, something tells me

20:49.560 --> 20:53.560
 that most of the systems they find will be run by humans.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.000
 Will be running JavaScript.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.600
 I kind of think that if we're living in a simulation,

20:58.600 --> 21:00.000
 it's written in JavaScript.

21:01.600 --> 21:04.520
 You know, for the longest time, even still,

21:05.540 --> 21:08.120
 JavaScript didn't get any respect,

21:08.120 --> 21:10.000
 and yet it runs so much of the world,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.120
 and an increasing number of the world.

21:12.120 --> 21:15.160
 Is it possible that everything will be written

21:15.160 --> 21:16.720
 in JavaScript one day?

21:16.720 --> 21:18.800
 So the engineering under JavaScript

21:18.800 --> 21:21.300
 is really pretty phenomenal.

21:21.300 --> 21:24.600
 The systems that make JavaScript run as fast

21:24.600 --> 21:27.520
 as it does right now are kind of miracles

21:27.520 --> 21:29.960
 of modern engineering in many ways.

21:29.960 --> 21:34.440
 It does feel like it is not an optimal language

21:34.440 --> 21:36.360
 for all the things that it's being used for,

21:36.360 --> 21:40.040
 or an optimal distribution system to build huge apps

21:40.040 --> 21:44.160
 in something like this without type systems and so on.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.520
 But I think for a lot of people,

21:47.520 --> 21:50.440
 it does reasonably the necessary things.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.280
 It's still a C flavored language.

21:52.280 --> 21:55.840
 It's still a braces and semicolon language.

21:55.840 --> 21:59.480
 It's not hard for people to be trained in JavaScript

21:59.480 --> 22:02.560
 and then understand the roots of where it came from.

22:02.560 --> 22:07.120
 I think garbage collection is unequivocally a good thing

22:07.120 --> 22:08.840
 for most programs to be written in.

22:08.840 --> 22:11.000
 It's funny that I still, just this morning,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.200
 I was seeing a Twitter thread

22:13.200 --> 22:15.560
 of a bunch of really senior game dev people

22:15.560 --> 22:18.880
 arguing about the virtues and costs of garbage collection.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.740
 You will run into some people that are top notch programmers

22:21.740 --> 22:24.640
 that just say, no, this is literally not a good thing.

22:24.640 --> 22:25.840
 Oh, because it makes you lazy?

22:25.840 --> 22:28.440
 Yes, that it makes you not think about things.

22:28.440 --> 22:29.640
 And I do disagree.

22:29.640 --> 22:33.320
 I think that there is so much objective data

22:33.320 --> 22:35.680
 on the vulnerabilities that have happened

22:35.680 --> 22:37.800
 in C and C++ programs,

22:37.800 --> 22:40.100
 sometimes written by the best programmers in the world.

22:40.100 --> 22:42.360
 It's like nobody is good enough to avoid

22:42.360 --> 22:44.200
 ever shooting themselves in the foot with that.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.540
 You write enough C code,

22:45.540 --> 22:47.620
 you're going to shoot yourself in the foot.

22:47.620 --> 22:50.000
 And garbage collection is a very great thing

22:50.000 --> 22:51.740
 for the vast majority of programs.

22:51.740 --> 22:54.720
 It's only when you get into the tightest of real time things

22:54.720 --> 22:56.500
 that you start saying, it's like, no,

22:56.500 --> 22:58.320
 the garbage collection has more costs

22:58.320 --> 22:59.940
 than it has benefits for me there,

22:59.940 --> 23:02.560
 but that's not 99 plus percent

23:02.560 --> 23:04.840
 of all the software in the world.

23:04.840 --> 23:09.360
 So JavaScript is not terrible in those ways.

23:09.360 --> 23:14.120
 And so much of programming is not the language itself.

23:14.120 --> 23:17.400
 It's the infrastructure around that surrounds it.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.040
 All the libraries that you can get

23:19.040 --> 23:20.480
 and the different stuff that you can,

23:20.480 --> 23:22.480
 ways you can deploy it,

23:22.480 --> 23:24.200
 the portability that it gives you.

23:24.200 --> 23:27.080
 And JavaScript is really strong on a lot of those things

23:27.080 --> 23:31.120
 where for a long time, and it still does if I look at it,

23:31.120 --> 23:34.020
 the web stack about everything that has to go

23:34.020 --> 23:36.460
 when you do something really trivial in JavaScript

23:36.460 --> 23:38.420
 and it shows up on a web browser

23:38.420 --> 23:40.360
 to kind of X ray through that

23:40.360 --> 23:42.280
 and see everything that has to happen

23:42.280 --> 23:44.680
 for your one little JavaScript statement

23:44.680 --> 23:48.280
 to turn into something visible in your web browser,

23:48.280 --> 23:51.160
 it's very, very disquieting,

23:51.160 --> 23:53.360
 just the depth of that stack

23:53.360 --> 23:56.840
 and the fact that so few people can even comprehend

23:56.840 --> 23:59.440
 all of the levels that are going on there.

23:59.440 --> 24:02.320
 But it's again, I have to caution myself

24:02.320 --> 24:05.540
 to not be the in the good old days old man about it

24:05.540 --> 24:08.760
 because clearly there's enormous value here.

24:08.760 --> 24:11.180
 The world does run on JavaScript

24:11.180 --> 24:13.280
 to a pretty good approximation there

24:13.280 --> 24:14.720
 and it's not falling apart.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.100
 There's a bunch of scary stuff

24:16.100 --> 24:18.400
 where you look at console logs

24:18.400 --> 24:20.940
 and you just see all of these bad things that are happening

24:20.940 --> 24:22.560
 but it's still kind of limping along

24:22.560 --> 24:24.760
 and nobody really notices.

24:24.760 --> 24:28.440
 But so much of my systems design

24:28.440 --> 24:30.720
 and systems analysis goes around.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.920
 You should understand what the speed of light is,

24:32.920 --> 24:36.120
 like what would be the best you could possibly do here.

24:36.120 --> 24:39.400
 And it sounds horrible, but in a lot of cases,

24:39.400 --> 24:42.720
 you can be a thousand times off your speed of light,

24:42.720 --> 24:45.520
 velocity for something and it's still be okay.

24:45.520 --> 24:48.360
 And in fact, it can even sometimes still be

24:48.360 --> 24:51.120
 the optimal thing in a larger system standpoint

24:51.120 --> 24:52.700
 where there's a lot of things

24:52.700 --> 24:55.640
 that you don't wanna have to parachute in someone like me

24:55.640 --> 24:59.880
 to go in and say, make this webpage run

24:59.880 --> 25:01.560
 a thousand times faster,

25:01.560 --> 25:05.320
 make this web app into a hardcore native application

25:05.320 --> 25:08.020
 that starts up in 37 milliseconds

25:08.020 --> 25:11.240
 and everything responds in less than one frame latency.

25:11.240 --> 25:12.680
 That's just not necessary.

25:12.680 --> 25:15.440
 And if somebody wants to go pay me millions of dollars

25:15.440 --> 25:16.680
 to do software like that,

25:16.680 --> 25:19.040
 when they can take somebody right out of a bootcamp

25:19.040 --> 25:21.960
 and say, spin up an application for this.

25:21.960 --> 25:26.960
 Often being efficient is not really the best metric.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.260
 And it's like, that applies in a lot of areas

25:29.260 --> 25:32.680
 where it's kind of interesting how a lot of our appliances

25:32.680 --> 25:36.360
 and everything are all built around energy efficiency,

25:36.360 --> 25:39.400
 sometimes at the expense of robustness in some other ways

25:39.400 --> 25:41.160
 or higher costs in other ways

25:41.160 --> 25:42.960
 where there's interesting things

25:42.960 --> 25:46.080
 where energy or electricity could become much cheaper

25:46.080 --> 25:47.040
 in a future world.

25:47.040 --> 25:49.040
 And that could change our engineering trade offs

25:49.040 --> 25:50.520
 for the way we build certain things

25:50.520 --> 25:53.100
 where you could throw away efficiency

25:53.100 --> 25:56.280
 and actually get more benefits that actually matter.

25:56.280 --> 25:59.320
 I mean, that's one of the directions

25:59.320 --> 26:02.760
 I was considering swerving into was nuclear energy.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.600
 When I was kind of like, what do I wanna do next?

26:04.600 --> 26:08.120
 It was either gonna be cost effective nuclear fission

26:08.120 --> 26:10.520
 or artificial general intelligence.

26:10.520 --> 26:14.680
 And one of my pet ideas there is like,

26:14.680 --> 26:18.400
 people don't understand how cheap nuclear fuel is.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.400
 And there would be ways that,

26:21.400 --> 26:24.760
 you could be a quarter of the efficiency or less,

26:24.760 --> 26:27.720
 but if it wound up making your plant 10 times cheaper,

26:27.720 --> 26:31.240
 that could be a radical innovation in something like that.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.560
 So there's like some of these thoughts

26:32.560 --> 26:35.520
 around like direct fission energy conversion,

26:35.520 --> 26:36.760
 fission fragment conversion,

26:36.760 --> 26:38.480
 that maybe you build something

26:38.480 --> 26:40.920
 that doesn't require all the steam turbines and everything,

26:40.920 --> 26:42.720
 even if it winds up being less efficient.

26:42.720 --> 26:45.060
 So that applies a lot in programming

26:45.060 --> 26:49.180
 where it's always good to know what you could do.

26:49.180 --> 26:52.040
 If you really sat down and took it far,

26:52.040 --> 26:53.760
 because sometimes there's discontinuities

26:53.760 --> 26:56.120
 like around user reaction times,

26:56.120 --> 26:59.200
 there are some points where the difference between

26:59.200 --> 27:02.920
 operating in one second and 750 milliseconds,

27:02.920 --> 27:03.920
 not that huge.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.680
 You'll see it in webpage statistics,

27:05.680 --> 27:08.260
 but most of the usability stuff, not that great.

27:08.260 --> 27:11.000
 But if you get down to 50 milliseconds,

27:11.000 --> 27:13.200
 then all of a sudden this just feels amazing.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.480
 It's just like doing your bidding instantly

27:15.480 --> 27:17.240
 rather than you're giving it a command,

27:17.240 --> 27:19.760
 twiddling your thumbs, waiting for it to respond.

27:19.760 --> 27:23.080
 So sometimes it's important to really crunch hard

27:23.080 --> 27:25.040
 to get over some threshold,

27:25.040 --> 27:28.920
 but there are broad basins in the value metric

27:28.920 --> 27:31.260
 for lots of work where it just doesn't pay

27:31.260 --> 27:33.000
 to even go that extra mile.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.320
 And there are craftsmen that just don't wanna buy that

27:36.320 --> 27:37.880
 and more power to them.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.120
 If somebody just wants to say,

27:39.120 --> 27:42.760
 no, I'm going to be, my pride is in my work,

27:42.760 --> 27:44.080
 I'm never going to do something

27:44.080 --> 27:46.400
 that's not as good as I could possibly make it,

27:46.400 --> 27:50.120
 I respect that and sometimes I am that person,

27:50.120 --> 27:53.840
 but I try to focus more on the larger value picture

27:53.840 --> 27:55.280
 and you do pick your battles

27:55.280 --> 27:57.400
 and you deploy your resources in the play

27:57.400 --> 28:00.720
 that's going to give you the best user value in the end.

28:00.720 --> 28:04.680
 Well, if you look at the evolution of life on Earth

28:04.680 --> 28:08.620
 as a kind of programming effort,

28:10.840 --> 28:13.320
 it seems like efficiency isn't the thing

28:13.320 --> 28:15.180
 that's being optimized for.

28:15.180 --> 28:17.220
 Like natural selection is very inefficient,

28:17.220 --> 28:21.580
 but it kind of adapts and through the process

28:21.580 --> 28:24.320
 of adaptations building more and more complex systems

28:24.320 --> 28:25.440
 that are more and more intelligent,

28:25.440 --> 28:28.320
 the final result is kind of pretty interesting.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.960
 And so I think of JavaScript the same way.

28:30.960 --> 28:33.040
 It's like this giant mess

28:33.040 --> 28:36.480
 that things naturally die off if they don't work

28:36.480 --> 28:39.440
 and if they become useful to people,

28:39.440 --> 28:40.900
 they kind of naturally live

28:40.900 --> 28:42.880
 and then you build this community,

28:42.880 --> 28:45.940
 large community of people that are generating code

28:45.940 --> 28:48.160
 and some code is sticky, some is not

28:48.160 --> 28:52.480
 and nobody knows the inefficiencies or the efficiencies

28:52.480 --> 28:54.920
 or the breaking points, like how reliable this code is

28:54.920 --> 28:57.820
 and you kind of just run it, assume it works

28:57.820 --> 29:00.440
 and then get unpleasantly surprised

29:00.440 --> 29:03.160
 and then that's very kind of the evolutionary process.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.980
 So that's a really good analogy

29:04.980 --> 29:06.840
 and we can go a lot of places with that

29:06.840 --> 29:09.540
 where in the earliest days of programming,

29:09.540 --> 29:11.920
 when you had finite, you could count the bytes

29:11.920 --> 29:13.080
 that you had to work on this,

29:13.080 --> 29:15.980
 you had all the kind of hackers playing code golf

29:15.980 --> 29:17.400
 to be one less instruction

29:17.400 --> 29:19.600
 than the other person's multiply routine

29:19.600 --> 29:22.880
 to kind of get through and it was so perfectly crafted.

29:22.880 --> 29:26.500
 It was a crystal piece of artwork when you had a program

29:26.500 --> 29:28.460
 because there just were not that many,

29:28.460 --> 29:31.320
 you couldn't afford to be lazy in different ways

29:31.320 --> 29:34.760
 and in many ways I see that as akin to the symbolic AI work

29:34.760 --> 29:38.480
 where again, if you did not have the resources to just say,

29:38.480 --> 29:40.600
 well, we're gonna do billions and billions

29:40.600 --> 29:42.680
 of programmable weights here,

29:42.680 --> 29:44.500
 you have to turn it down into something

29:44.500 --> 29:47.400
 that is symbolic and crafted like that

29:47.400 --> 29:51.140
 but that's definitely not the way DNA and life

29:51.140 --> 29:54.160
 and biological evolution and things work.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.360
 On the one hand, it's almost humbling

29:58.360 --> 30:00.920
 how little programming code is in our bodies.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.540
 We've got a couple of billion base pairs

30:02.540 --> 30:05.680
 and it's like this all fits on a thumb drive for years now

30:05.680 --> 30:08.380
 and then our brains are even a smaller section of that.

30:08.380 --> 30:10.000
 You've got maybe 50 megabytes

30:10.000 --> 30:13.720
 and this is not like Shannon Limit perfectly

30:13.720 --> 30:17.480
 information dense conveyances here.

30:17.480 --> 30:19.480
 It's like these are messy codes,

30:19.480 --> 30:21.520
 they're broken up into amino acids.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.960
 A lot of them don't do important things

30:23.960 --> 30:26.360
 or they do things in very awkward ways

30:26.360 --> 30:29.160
 but it is this process of just accumulation

30:29.160 --> 30:33.320
 on top of things and you need scale,

30:33.320 --> 30:36.880
 both you need scale for the population for that to work out

30:36.880 --> 30:39.880
 and in the early days in the 50s and 60s,

30:39.880 --> 30:42.660
 the kind of ancient era of computers

30:42.660 --> 30:44.560
 where you could count when they say like

30:44.560 --> 30:46.240
 when the internet started even in the 70s,

30:46.240 --> 30:48.180
 there were like 18 hosts or something on it.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.440
 It was this small finite number

30:50.440 --> 30:52.260
 and you were still optimizing everything

30:52.260 --> 30:54.560
 to be as good as you possibly could be

30:54.560 --> 30:57.760
 but now it's billions and billions of devices

30:57.760 --> 31:00.360
 and everything going on and you can have

31:00.360 --> 31:03.560
 this very much natural evolution going on

31:03.560 --> 31:06.000
 where lots of things are tried,

31:06.000 --> 31:07.360
 lots of things are blowing up,

31:07.360 --> 31:09.440
 venture capitalists lose their money

31:09.440 --> 31:11.840
 when a startup invested in the wrong tech stack

31:11.840 --> 31:14.820
 and things completely failed or failed the scale

31:14.820 --> 31:17.440
 but good things do come out of it

31:17.440 --> 31:21.060
 and it's interesting to see the mimetic evolution

31:21.060 --> 31:22.680
 of the way different things happen

31:22.680 --> 31:24.440
 like mentioning hello world at the beginning.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.480
 It's funny how some little thing like that

31:26.480 --> 31:29.640
 where everybody, every programmer knows hello world now

31:29.640 --> 31:32.140
 and that was a completely arbitrary sort of decision

31:32.140 --> 31:35.600
 that just came out of the dominance of Unix and C

31:35.600 --> 31:38.440
 and early examples of things like that.

31:38.440 --> 31:42.340
 So millions of experiments are going on all the time

31:42.340 --> 31:44.840
 but some things do kind of rise to the top

31:44.840 --> 31:48.240
 and win the fitness war for whether it's mind space

31:48.240 --> 31:50.400
 or programming techniques or anything.

31:50.400 --> 31:54.400
 Like there's a site on Stack Exchange called CodeGolf

31:54.400 --> 31:57.960
 where people compete to write the shortest possible program

31:57.960 --> 32:00.320
 for a particular task in all the different kinds

32:00.320 --> 32:03.040
 of languages and it's really interesting to see

32:04.880 --> 32:09.880
 folks kind of, they're masters of their craft,

32:10.000 --> 32:13.460
 really play with the limits of programming languages.

32:13.460 --> 32:14.600
 It's really beautiful to see

32:14.600 --> 32:17.040
 and across all the different programming languages,

32:17.040 --> 32:20.600
 you get to see some of these weird programming languages

32:20.600 --> 32:25.080
 and mainstream ones, difference between Python 2 and 3,

32:25.080 --> 32:27.680
 you get to see the difference between C and C++ and Java

32:27.680 --> 32:30.000
 and you get to see JavaScript, all of that

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
 and it's kind of inspiring to see how much depth

32:38.120 --> 32:41.040
 of possibility there is within programming languages

32:41.040 --> 32:44.160
 that CodeGolf kind of tasks reveal.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.560
 Most of us, if you do any kind of programming,

32:46.560 --> 32:51.120
 you kind of do boring kind of very vanilla type of code.

32:51.120 --> 32:52.840
 That's the way to build large systems

32:52.840 --> 32:54.700
 but it's nice to see that the possibility

32:54.700 --> 32:57.600
 of creative genius is still within those languages.

32:57.600 --> 33:00.100
 It's laden within those languages.

33:00.100 --> 33:03.180
 So given that you are once again,

33:03.180 --> 33:05.680
 one of the greatest programmers ever,

33:05.680 --> 33:08.320
 what do you think makes a good programmer?

33:08.320 --> 33:10.960
 Maybe a good modern programmer.

33:10.960 --> 33:15.680
 So I just gave a long rant slash lecture at Meta

33:15.680 --> 33:20.440
 to the TPM organization and my biggest point was

33:20.440 --> 33:23.280
 everything that we're doing really should flow

33:23.280 --> 33:26.120
 from user value, all the good things that we're doing.

33:26.120 --> 33:28.440
 It's like, we're not technical people.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.960
 It's like, you shouldn't be taking pride

33:30.960 --> 33:32.080
 just in the specific thing.

33:32.080 --> 33:34.880
 Like CodeGolf is the sort of thing, it's a fun puzzle game

33:34.880 --> 33:38.160
 but that really should not be a major motivator for you.

33:38.160 --> 33:40.260
 It's like, we're solving problems for people

33:40.260 --> 33:41.960
 or we're providing entertainment to people.

33:41.960 --> 33:44.160
 We're doing something of value to people

33:44.160 --> 33:46.240
 that's displacing something else in their life.

33:46.240 --> 33:49.000
 So we wanna be providing a net value

33:49.000 --> 33:51.360
 over what they could be doing

33:51.360 --> 33:53.520
 but instead they're choosing to use our products.

33:53.520 --> 33:56.640
 And that's where, I mean, it sounds trite or corny

33:56.640 --> 33:59.200
 but I fundamentally do think that's how you make

33:59.200 --> 34:00.360
 the world a better place.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.900
 If you have given more value to people

34:02.900 --> 34:05.720
 than it took you and your team to create,

34:05.720 --> 34:07.560
 then the world's a better place.

34:07.560 --> 34:10.500
 People have, they've gone from something of lesser value,

34:10.500 --> 34:11.980
 chosen to use your product

34:11.980 --> 34:13.880
 and their life feels better for that.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.280
 And if you've produced that economically,

34:16.280 --> 34:18.520
 that's a really good thing.

34:19.480 --> 34:22.800
 On the other hand, if you spent ridiculous amounts of money

34:22.800 --> 34:24.340
 you've just kind of shoveled a lot of cash

34:24.340 --> 34:25.720
 into a wood chipper there

34:25.720 --> 34:28.160
 and you should maybe not feel so good

34:28.160 --> 34:29.720
 about what you're doing.

34:29.720 --> 34:33.560
 So being proud about like a specific architecture

34:33.560 --> 34:36.440
 or a specific technology or a specific code sequence

34:36.440 --> 34:39.160
 that you've done, it's great to get a little smile

34:39.160 --> 34:41.140
 like a tiny little dopamine hit for that

34:41.140 --> 34:43.340
 but the top level metrics should be

34:43.340 --> 34:45.440
 that you're building things of value.

34:45.440 --> 34:48.040
 Now you can get into the argument about how you,

34:48.040 --> 34:49.360
 what is user value?

34:49.360 --> 34:51.240
 How do you actually quantify that?

34:51.240 --> 34:53.360
 And there can be big arguments about that

34:53.360 --> 34:55.120
 but it's easy to be able to say,

34:55.120 --> 34:57.900
 okay, this pissed off user there is not getting value

34:57.900 --> 34:59.080
 from what you're doing.

34:59.080 --> 35:01.980
 This user over there with the big smile on their face,

35:01.980 --> 35:04.240
 the moment of delight when something happened,

35:04.240 --> 35:05.900
 there's a value that's happened there.

35:05.900 --> 35:07.720
 I mean, you have to at least accept

35:07.720 --> 35:09.840
 that there is a concept of user value

35:09.840 --> 35:12.880
 even if you have trouble exactly quantifying it,

35:12.880 --> 35:15.480
 you can usually make relative arguments about it.

35:15.480 --> 35:18.860
 Well, this was better than this, we've improved things.

35:18.860 --> 35:23.720
 So being a servant to the user is your job

35:23.720 --> 35:26.680
 when you're a developer, you wanna be producing something

35:26.680 --> 35:30.000
 that other people are gonna find valuable.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.540
 And if you are technically inclined

35:32.540 --> 35:35.760
 then finding the right levers to be able to pull

35:35.760 --> 35:39.080
 to be able to make a design that's going to produce

35:39.080 --> 35:41.680
 the most value for the least amount of effort.

35:41.680 --> 35:44.000
 And it always has to be kind of divided,

35:44.000 --> 35:45.940
 there's a ratio there where you,

35:45.940 --> 35:48.080
 it's a problem at the big tech companies,

35:48.080 --> 35:52.240
 whether it's Meta Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon,

35:52.240 --> 35:55.320
 companies that have almost infinite money.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.720
 I mean, I know their CFO will complain

35:57.720 --> 35:58.840
 that it's not infinite money

35:58.840 --> 36:00.640
 but from most developers standpoints

36:00.640 --> 36:02.680
 it really does feel like it.

36:02.680 --> 36:04.880
 And it's almost counterintuitive

36:04.880 --> 36:07.960
 that if you're working hard as a developer on something,

36:07.960 --> 36:08.820
 there's always this thought,

36:08.820 --> 36:12.360
 if only I had more resources, more people, more RAM,

36:12.360 --> 36:16.400
 more megahertz, then my product will be better.

36:16.400 --> 36:19.600
 And that sense that at certain points, it's certainly true

36:19.600 --> 36:22.080
 that if you are really hamstrung by this,

36:22.080 --> 36:25.200
 removing an obstacle will make a better product,

36:25.200 --> 36:26.980
 make more value.

36:26.980 --> 36:30.120
 But if you're not making your core design decisions

36:30.120 --> 36:33.080
 in this fiercely competitive way

36:33.080 --> 36:35.780
 where you're saying feature A or feature B,

36:35.780 --> 36:38.680
 you can't just say, let's do both.

36:38.680 --> 36:41.160
 Because then you're not making a value judgment about them.

36:41.160 --> 36:43.000
 You're just saying, well, they both seem good.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.200
 I don't wanna necessarily have to pick out

36:45.200 --> 36:47.460
 which one is better or how much better

36:47.460 --> 36:51.020
 and tell team B that, sorry, we're not gonna do this

36:51.020 --> 36:53.160
 because A is more important.

36:53.160 --> 36:57.120
 But that notion of always having to really critically value

36:57.120 --> 36:59.720
 what you're doing, your time, the resources you expend,

36:59.720 --> 37:02.620
 even the opportunity cost of doing something else,

37:02.620 --> 37:04.840
 that's super important.

37:04.840 --> 37:07.600
 Well, let me ask you about the big debates

37:07.600 --> 37:09.980
 that you're mentioning of how to measure value.

37:12.120 --> 37:15.620
 Is it possible to measure it kind of numerically

37:19.400 --> 37:22.120
 or can you do the sort of Johnny Ive,

37:22.120 --> 37:25.120
 the designer route of imagining

37:26.020 --> 37:28.720
 sort of somebody using a thing

37:28.720 --> 37:30.840
 and imagining a smile on their face,

37:30.840 --> 37:34.000
 imagining the experience of love and joy

37:34.000 --> 37:35.980
 that you have when you use the thing.

37:35.980 --> 37:37.320
 That's from a design perspective

37:37.320 --> 37:40.440
 or if you're building more like a lower level thing

37:40.440 --> 37:43.400
 for like Linux, you imagine a developer

37:43.400 --> 37:45.440
 that might come across this and use it

37:45.440 --> 37:50.440
 and become happy and better off because of it.

37:50.440 --> 37:52.620
 So where do you land on those things?

37:52.620 --> 37:53.680
 Is it measurable?

37:53.680 --> 37:57.280
 So I imagine like Meta and Google

37:57.280 --> 37:58.920
 will probably try to measure the thing.

37:58.920 --> 38:01.520
 They'll try to, it's like you try to optimize engagement

38:01.520 --> 38:03.240
 or something, let's measure engagement.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.360
 And then I think there is a kind of,

38:05.360 --> 38:09.360
 I mean, I admire the designer ethic of like,

38:09.360 --> 38:13.000
 think of a future that's immeasurable

38:13.000 --> 38:15.320
 and you try to make somebody in that future

38:15.320 --> 38:17.320
 that's different from today happy.

38:17.320 --> 38:20.440
 So I do usually favor,

38:20.440 --> 38:23.800
 if you can get any kind of a metric that's good,

38:23.800 --> 38:25.840
 by all means, listen to the data.

38:25.840 --> 38:28.480
 But you can go too far there where we've had problems

38:28.480 --> 38:30.640
 where it's like, hey, we had a performance regression

38:30.640 --> 38:33.280
 because our fancy new telemetry system

38:33.280 --> 38:36.000
 is doing a bazillion file writes

38:36.000 --> 38:37.200
 to kind of archive this stuff

38:37.200 --> 38:38.740
 because we needed to collect information

38:38.740 --> 38:40.600
 to determine if we were doing,

38:40.600 --> 38:42.600
 if our plans were good.

38:42.600 --> 38:45.540
 So when information is available,

38:45.540 --> 38:46.720
 you should never ignore it.

38:46.720 --> 38:47.560
 I mean, all of it.

38:47.560 --> 38:49.680
 For actual users using the thing,

38:49.680 --> 38:51.400
 human beings using the thing,

38:51.400 --> 38:52.880
 large number of human beings,

38:52.880 --> 38:54.720
 and you get to see sort of a lot of large numbers.

38:54.720 --> 38:55.920
 So there's the zero to one problem

38:55.920 --> 38:57.560
 of when you're doing something really new,

38:57.560 --> 38:59.280
 you do kind of have to make a guess.

38:59.280 --> 39:02.000
 But one of the points that I've been making at Meta

39:02.000 --> 39:05.120
 is we have more than enough users now

39:05.120 --> 39:08.440
 that anything somebody wants to try in VR,

39:08.440 --> 39:10.780
 we have users that will be interested in that.

39:10.780 --> 39:13.080
 You do not get to make a completely

39:13.080 --> 39:15.820
 greenfield blue sky pitch and say,

39:15.820 --> 39:18.660
 I'm going to do this because I think it might be interesting.

39:18.660 --> 39:20.120
 I challenge everyone.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.640
 There are going to be people,

39:21.640 --> 39:24.200
 whether it's working in VR on your,

39:24.200 --> 39:26.880
 like on your desktop replacement

39:26.880 --> 39:29.560
 or communicating with people in different ways

39:29.560 --> 39:31.640
 or playing the games.

39:31.640 --> 39:35.120
 There are going to be probably millions of people,

39:35.120 --> 39:37.200
 or at least if you pick some tiny niche

39:37.200 --> 39:38.660
 that we're not in right now,

39:38.660 --> 39:40.820
 there's still going to be thousands of people out there

39:40.820 --> 39:43.860
 that have the headsets that would be your target market.

39:43.860 --> 39:46.060
 And I tell people, pay attention to them.

39:46.060 --> 39:47.680
 Don't invent fictional users.

39:47.680 --> 39:50.240
 Don't make an Alice Bob Charlie

39:50.240 --> 39:53.580
 that fits whatever matrix of tendencies

39:53.580 --> 39:55.360
 that you want to break the market down to,

39:55.360 --> 39:58.320
 because it's a mistake to think about imaginary users

39:58.320 --> 40:01.920
 when you've got real users that you could be working with.

40:01.920 --> 40:03.080
 But on the other hand,

40:03.080 --> 40:07.000
 there is value to having a kind of wholeness

40:07.000 --> 40:09.520
 of vision for a product.

40:09.520 --> 40:13.680
 And companies like Meta have,

40:13.680 --> 40:16.520
 they understand the trade offs where you can have a company

40:16.520 --> 40:20.240
 like SpaceX or Apple in the Steve Jobs era,

40:20.240 --> 40:23.360
 where you have a very powerful leading personality

40:23.360 --> 40:26.700
 that can micromanage at a very low level

40:26.700 --> 40:29.360
 and can say it's like, no, that handle needs to be different

40:29.360 --> 40:32.760
 or that icon needs to change the tint there.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.960
 And they clearly get a lot of value out of it.

40:34.960 --> 40:37.200
 They also burn through a lot of employees

40:37.200 --> 40:39.000
 that have horror stories to tell

40:39.000 --> 40:41.680
 about working there afterwards.

40:41.680 --> 40:45.120
 My position is that you're at your best

40:45.120 --> 40:48.120
 when you've got a leader that is at their limit

40:48.120 --> 40:49.760
 of what they can kind of comprehend

40:49.760 --> 40:51.480
 of everything below them.

40:51.480 --> 40:53.440
 And they can have an informed opinion

40:53.440 --> 40:55.360
 about everything that's going on.

40:55.360 --> 40:57.480
 And you take somebody, you've got to believe

40:57.480 --> 41:01.100
 that somebody that has 30, 40 years of experience,

41:01.100 --> 41:02.680
 you would hope that they've got wisdom

41:02.680 --> 41:06.160
 that the just out of bootcamp person contributing

41:06.160 --> 41:07.000
 doesn't have.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.140
 And that if they're like, well, that's wrong there,

41:09.140 --> 41:10.600
 you probably shouldn't do it that way

41:10.600 --> 41:14.120
 or even just don't do it that way, do it another way.

41:14.120 --> 41:15.500
 So there's value there,

41:15.500 --> 41:17.840
 but it can't go beyond a certain level.

41:17.840 --> 41:21.360
 I mean, I have Steve Jobs stories of him saying things

41:21.360 --> 41:23.060
 that are just wrong right in front of me

41:23.060 --> 41:25.840
 about technical things because he was not operating

41:25.840 --> 41:26.880
 at that level.

41:28.460 --> 41:30.480
 But when it does work and you do get

41:30.480 --> 41:32.020
 that kind of passionate leader

41:32.020 --> 41:34.120
 that's thinking about the entire product

41:34.120 --> 41:35.840
 and just really deeply cares

41:35.840 --> 41:39.060
 about not letting anything slip through the cracks,

41:39.060 --> 41:40.560
 I think that's got a lot of value.

41:40.560 --> 41:42.520
 But the other side of that is the people saying that,

41:42.520 --> 41:44.520
 well, we wanna have these independent teams

41:44.520 --> 41:46.040
 that are bubbling up the ideas

41:46.040 --> 41:49.480
 because it's almost it's anti capitalist

41:49.480 --> 41:50.940
 or anti free market to say,

41:50.940 --> 41:53.240
 it's like I want my grand, my great leader

41:53.240 --> 41:55.240
 to go ahead and dictate all these points there

41:55.240 --> 41:57.680
 where clearly free markets bring up things

41:57.680 --> 41:59.360
 that you don't expect.

41:59.360 --> 42:01.800
 Like in VR, we saw a bunch of things

42:01.800 --> 42:03.080
 like it didn't turn out at all

42:03.080 --> 42:04.320
 the way the early people thought

42:04.320 --> 42:06.040
 were gonna be the key applications

42:06.040 --> 42:08.800
 and things that would not have been approved

42:08.800 --> 42:12.260
 by the dark cabal making the decisions

42:12.260 --> 42:14.680
 about what gets into the store turn out

42:14.680 --> 42:17.640
 to in some cases be extremely successful.

42:17.640 --> 42:20.460
 So yeah, I definitely kind of wanted to be,

42:20.460 --> 42:22.200
 there was a point where I did make a pitch.

42:22.200 --> 42:23.840
 It's like, hey, make me VR dictator

42:23.840 --> 42:25.480
 and I'll go in and get shit done.

42:25.480 --> 42:28.600
 I am, and that's just, it's not in the culture at Meta.

42:28.600 --> 42:31.640
 You know, and they understand the trade offs they,

42:31.640 --> 42:32.960
 and that's just not the way,

42:32.960 --> 42:34.500
 that's not the company that they want,

42:34.500 --> 42:37.240
 the team that they wanna do.

42:37.240 --> 42:40.120
 It's fascinating because VR and we'll talk about it more.

42:40.120 --> 42:43.040
 It's still unclear to me

42:44.260 --> 42:46.920
 in what way VR will change the world

42:46.920 --> 42:48.520
 because it does seem clear that VR

42:48.520 --> 42:51.720
 will somehow fundamentally transform this world

42:51.720 --> 42:54.840
 and it's unclear to me how yet.

42:54.840 --> 42:56.880
 Let me know when you wanna get into that.

42:56.880 --> 42:57.720
 Who will?

42:57.720 --> 42:58.540
 Well, hold on a second.

42:58.540 --> 43:02.760
 So in the stick to the you being the best programmer ever.

43:02.760 --> 43:05.200
 Okay, in the early days when you didn't have,

43:05.200 --> 43:07.080
 when you didn't have adult responsibilities

43:07.080 --> 43:09.320
 of leading teams and all that kind of stuff

43:09.320 --> 43:13.200
 and you can focus on just being a programmer,

43:13.200 --> 43:15.880
 what did the productive day in the life

43:15.880 --> 43:17.760
 of John Carmack look like?

43:17.760 --> 43:19.200
 How many hours is the keyboard?

43:19.200 --> 43:20.520
 How much sleep?

43:20.520 --> 43:24.280
 What was the source of calories that fueled the brain?

43:24.280 --> 43:25.200
 What was it like?

43:25.200 --> 43:26.960
 What times did you wake up?

43:26.960 --> 43:29.500
 So I was able to be remarkably consistent

43:29.500 --> 43:32.100
 about what was good working conditions for me

43:32.100 --> 43:33.540
 for a very long time.

43:34.800 --> 43:36.800
 I was never one of the programmers

43:37.800 --> 43:40.100
 that would do all nighters going through work

43:40.100 --> 43:41.220
 for 20 hours straight.

43:41.220 --> 43:43.840
 It's like my brain generally starts turning to mush

43:43.840 --> 43:45.860
 after 12 hours or so.

43:45.860 --> 43:48.940
 But the hard work is really important

43:48.940 --> 43:51.180
 and I would work for decades.

43:51.180 --> 43:52.700
 I would work 60 hours a week.

43:52.700 --> 43:55.260
 I would work a 10 hour day, six days a week

43:55.260 --> 43:58.060
 and try to be productive at that.

43:58.060 --> 44:00.100
 Now my schedule shifted around a fair amount

44:00.100 --> 44:02.260
 when I was young without any kids

44:02.260 --> 44:04.020
 and any other responsibilities.

44:04.020 --> 44:06.300
 I was on one of those cycling schedules

44:06.300 --> 44:08.620
 where I'd kind of get in an hour later each day

44:08.620 --> 44:11.100
 and roll around through the entire time

44:11.100 --> 44:13.860
 and I'd wind up kind of pulling in at two or three

44:13.860 --> 44:16.220
 in the afternoon sometimes and then working again

44:16.220 --> 44:19.100
 past midnight or two in the morning.

44:19.100 --> 44:22.900
 And that was, when it was just me trying

44:22.900 --> 44:26.460
 to make things happen and I was usually isolated off

44:26.460 --> 44:30.100
 in my office, people generally didn't bother me much at in

44:30.100 --> 44:34.100
 and I could get a lot of programming work done that way.

44:34.100 --> 44:36.380
 I did settle into a more normal schedule

44:36.380 --> 44:39.500
 when I was taking kids to school and things like that.

44:39.500 --> 44:42.020
 So kids were the forcing function that got you to wake up

44:42.020 --> 44:43.980
 at the same time each day.

44:43.980 --> 44:46.740
 It's not clear to me that there was much of a difference

44:46.740 --> 44:50.740
 in the productivity with that where I kind of feel,

44:50.740 --> 44:52.500
 if I just get up when I feel like it,

44:52.500 --> 44:54.420
 it's usually a little later each day

44:54.420 --> 44:57.620
 but I just recently made the focusing decision

44:57.620 --> 44:59.980
 to try to push my schedule back a little bit earlier

44:59.980 --> 45:01.980
 to getting up at eight in the morning

45:01.980 --> 45:04.220
 and trying to shift things around.

45:04.220 --> 45:07.340
 Like I'm often doing experiments with myself

45:07.340 --> 45:10.260
 about what should I be doing to be more productive

45:10.260 --> 45:13.380
 and one of the things that I did realize was happening

45:13.380 --> 45:18.380
 in recent months where I would go for a walk or a run.

45:18.540 --> 45:22.660
 I cover like four miles a day and I would usually do that

45:22.660 --> 45:25.580
 just as the sun's going down here in Texas now

45:25.580 --> 45:27.820
 and it's still really damn hot but I'd go out

45:27.820 --> 45:31.300
 at 8.30 or something and cover the time there

45:31.300 --> 45:34.100
 and then the showering and it was putting a hold in my day

45:34.100 --> 45:36.980
 where I would have still a couple hours after that

45:36.980 --> 45:38.860
 and sometimes my best hours were at night

45:38.860 --> 45:41.300
 when nobody else is around, nobody's bothering me

45:41.300 --> 45:43.420
 but that hole in the day was a problem

45:43.420 --> 45:46.780
 so just a couple weeks ago, I made the change

45:46.780 --> 45:47.620
 to go ahead and say, all right,

45:47.620 --> 45:48.780
 I'm gonna get up a little earlier,

45:48.780 --> 45:51.180
 I'm gonna do a walk or get out there first

45:51.180 --> 45:53.340
 so I can have more uninterrupted time.

45:53.340 --> 45:55.500
 So I'm still playing with factors like this

45:55.500 --> 45:59.340
 as I kind of optimize my work efforts

45:59.340 --> 46:03.060
 but it's always been, it was 60 hours a week

46:03.060 --> 46:04.380
 for a very long time.

46:04.380 --> 46:06.660
 To some degree, I had a little thing in the back of my head

46:06.660 --> 46:08.980
 where I was almost jealous of some of the programmers

46:08.980 --> 46:10.740
 that would do these marathon sessions

46:10.740 --> 46:13.420
 and I had like Dave Taylor, one of the guys that he had,

46:13.420 --> 46:14.580
 he would be one of those people

46:14.580 --> 46:16.580
 that would fall asleep under his desk sometimes

46:16.580 --> 46:19.500
 and all the kind of classic hacker tropes about things

46:19.500 --> 46:22.140
 and a part of me was like always a little bothered

46:22.140 --> 46:25.460
 that that wasn't me, that I wouldn't go program

46:25.460 --> 46:28.300
 20 hours straight because I'm falling apart

46:28.300 --> 46:31.220
 and not being very effective after 12 hours.

46:31.220 --> 46:32.780
 I mean, yeah, 12 hour programming,

46:32.780 --> 46:34.180
 that's fine when you're doing that

46:34.180 --> 46:38.060
 but it never, you're not doing smart work much after,

46:38.060 --> 46:40.460
 at least I'm not, but there's a range of people.

46:40.460 --> 46:41.980
 I mean, that's something that a lot of people

46:41.980 --> 46:43.860
 don't really get in their gut

46:43.860 --> 46:46.740
 where there are people that work on four hours of sleep

46:46.740 --> 46:48.980
 and are smart and can continue to do good work

46:48.980 --> 46:51.580
 but then there's a lot of people that just fall apart.

46:51.580 --> 46:54.620
 So I do tell people that I always try

46:54.620 --> 46:55.860
 to get eight hours of sleep.

46:55.860 --> 46:58.380
 It's not this, you know, push yourself harder,

46:58.380 --> 47:00.980
 get up earlier, I just do worse work

47:00.980 --> 47:04.140
 where, you know, you can work a hundred hours a week

47:04.140 --> 47:05.740
 and still get eight hours of sleep

47:05.740 --> 47:08.340
 if you just kind of prioritize things correctly

47:08.340 --> 47:11.340
 but I do believe in working hard, working a lot.

47:12.380 --> 47:14.820
 There was a comment that a game dev made

47:14.820 --> 47:18.940
 that I know there's a backlash against really hard work

47:18.940 --> 47:21.620
 in a lot of cases and I get into online arguments

47:21.620 --> 47:24.460
 about this all the time but he was basically saying,

47:24.460 --> 47:27.340
 yeah, 40 hours a week, that's kind of a part time job

47:27.340 --> 47:29.340
 and if you were really in it,

47:29.340 --> 47:31.300
 you're doing what you think is important,

47:31.300 --> 47:34.940
 what you're passionate about, working more gets more done

47:34.940 --> 47:39.180
 and it's just really not possible to argue with that

47:39.180 --> 47:40.500
 if you've been around the people

47:40.500 --> 47:42.740
 that work with that level of intensity

47:42.740 --> 47:45.820
 and just say, it's like, no, they should just stop.

47:45.820 --> 47:49.060
 And we had, I kind of came back around to that

47:49.060 --> 47:51.300
 a couple of years ago where I was using

47:51.300 --> 47:55.060
 the fictional example of, all right, some people say,

47:55.060 --> 47:57.340
 they'll say with a straight face, they think, no,

47:57.340 --> 47:59.300
 you are less productive if you work

47:59.300 --> 48:01.140
 more than 40 hours a week.

48:01.140 --> 48:03.060
 And they're generally misinterpreting things

48:03.060 --> 48:05.860
 where your marginal productivity for an hour

48:05.860 --> 48:08.940
 after eight hours is less than in one of your peak hours

48:08.940 --> 48:11.180
 but you're not literally getting less done.

48:11.180 --> 48:13.260
 There is a point where you start breaking things

48:13.260 --> 48:16.580
 and getting worse behavior and everything out of it

48:16.580 --> 48:18.380
 where you're literally going backwards

48:18.380 --> 48:21.300
 but it's not at eight or 10 or 12 hours.

48:21.300 --> 48:23.660
 And the fictional example I would use was,

48:23.660 --> 48:27.140
 imagine there's an asteroid coming to impact,

48:27.140 --> 48:30.420
 to crash into Earth, destroy all of human life.

48:30.420 --> 48:34.180
 Do you want Elon Musk or the people working at SpaceX

48:34.180 --> 48:35.620
 that are building the interceptor

48:35.620 --> 48:38.460
 that's going to deflect the asteroid,

48:38.460 --> 48:40.180
 do you want them to clock out at five

48:40.180 --> 48:42.700
 because damn it, they're just gonna go do worse work

48:42.700 --> 48:44.780
 if they work another couple hours.

48:44.780 --> 48:47.100
 And it seems absurd.

48:47.100 --> 48:48.580
 And that's a hypothetical though

48:48.580 --> 48:49.940
 and everyone can dismiss that.

48:49.940 --> 48:52.020
 But then when coronavirus was hitting

48:52.020 --> 48:54.580
 and you have all of these medical personnel

48:54.580 --> 48:58.060
 that are clearly pushing themselves really, really hard

48:58.060 --> 48:59.820
 and I'd say, it's like, okay,

48:59.820 --> 49:03.140
 do you want all of these scientists working on treatments

49:03.140 --> 49:05.660
 and vaccines and caring for all of these people?

49:05.660 --> 49:07.700
 Are they really screwing everything up

49:07.700 --> 49:09.780
 by working more than eight hours a day?

49:09.780 --> 49:11.420
 And of course people say, I'm just an asshole

49:11.420 --> 49:15.220
 to say something like that, but it's the truth.

49:15.220 --> 49:17.540
 Working longer gets more done.

49:17.540 --> 49:20.540
 Well, so that's kind of the layer one.

49:20.540 --> 49:22.540
 But I'd like to also say that,

49:22.540 --> 49:25.940
 at least I believe, depending on the person,

49:25.940 --> 49:30.700
 depending on the task, working more and harder

49:30.700 --> 49:35.700
 will make you better for the next week

49:35.980 --> 49:37.660
 in those peak hours.

49:37.660 --> 49:41.380
 So there's something about a deep dedication to a thing

49:42.540 --> 49:44.820
 that kind of gets deep in you.

49:44.820 --> 49:48.220
 So the hard work isn't just about the raw hours

49:48.220 --> 49:53.220
 of productivity, it's the thing it does to you

49:54.220 --> 49:56.780
 in the weeks and months after too.

49:56.780 --> 49:59.100
 You're tempering yourself in some ways.

49:59.100 --> 50:01.940
 And I think, it's like Jiro dreams of sushi.

50:01.940 --> 50:03.820
 If you really dedicate yourself completely

50:03.820 --> 50:08.020
 to making the sushi, to really putting in the long hours,

50:08.020 --> 50:12.540
 day after day after day, you become a true craftsman

50:12.540 --> 50:14.380
 of the thing you're doing.

50:14.380 --> 50:16.300
 Now there's, of course, discussions about

50:16.300 --> 50:18.940
 are you sacrificing a lot of personal relationships?

50:18.940 --> 50:21.740
 Are you sacrificing a lot of other possible things

50:21.740 --> 50:22.780
 you could do with that time?

50:22.780 --> 50:27.780
 But if you're talking about purely being a master

50:28.220 --> 50:30.660
 or a craftsman of your art,

50:30.660 --> 50:34.980
 that more hours isn't just about doing more,

50:34.980 --> 50:37.300
 it's about becoming better at the thing you're doing.

50:37.300 --> 50:38.780
 Yeah, and I don't gainsay anybody

50:38.780 --> 50:41.180
 that wants to work the minimum amount.

50:41.180 --> 50:42.980
 They've got other priorities in their life.

50:42.980 --> 50:44.660
 My only argument that I'm making,

50:44.660 --> 50:46.980
 it's not that everybody should work hard,

50:46.980 --> 50:49.380
 it's that if you want to accomplish something,

50:49.380 --> 50:50.820
 working longer and harder

50:50.820 --> 50:53.340
 is the path to getting it accomplished.

50:53.340 --> 50:55.180
 Well, let me ask you about this then,

50:56.180 --> 50:58.900
 the mythical work life balance.

51:01.180 --> 51:03.060
 For an engineer, it seems like

51:03.060 --> 51:07.260
 that's one of the professions for a programmer

51:07.260 --> 51:12.260
 where working hard does lead to greater productivity in it.

51:12.260 --> 51:15.620
 But it also raises the question of

51:17.020 --> 51:19.660
 sort of personal relationships and all that kind of stuff,

51:19.660 --> 51:24.300
 family, and how are you able to find work life balance?

51:24.300 --> 51:25.740
 Is there advice you can give,

51:25.740 --> 51:27.580
 maybe even outside of yourself?

51:27.580 --> 51:29.900
 Have you been able to arrive at any wisdom

51:29.900 --> 51:32.380
 on this part in your years of life?

51:32.380 --> 51:34.580
 I do think that there's a wide range of people

51:34.580 --> 51:36.760
 where different people have different needs.

51:36.760 --> 51:38.660
 It's not a one size fits all.

51:38.660 --> 51:40.740
 I am certainly what works for me.

51:40.740 --> 51:45.140
 I can tell enough that I'm different

51:45.140 --> 51:46.620
 than a typical average person

51:46.620 --> 51:48.620
 in the way things impact me,

51:48.620 --> 51:50.300
 the things that I want to do,

51:50.300 --> 51:51.540
 my goals are different,

51:51.540 --> 51:55.160
 and sort of the levers to impact things are different,

51:55.160 --> 51:59.540
 where I have literally never felt burnout,

51:59.540 --> 52:02.060
 and I know there's lots of brilliant, smart people

52:02.060 --> 52:05.340
 that do world leading work that get burned out,

52:05.340 --> 52:08.060
 and it's never hit me.

52:08.060 --> 52:11.700
 I've never been at a point where I'm like,

52:11.700 --> 52:13.200
 I just don't care about this.

52:13.200 --> 52:14.780
 I don't want to do this anymore.

52:14.780 --> 52:16.420
 But I've always had the flexibility

52:16.420 --> 52:18.900
 to work on lots of interesting things.

52:18.900 --> 52:21.480
 I can always just turn my gaze to something else

52:21.480 --> 52:23.500
 and have a great time working on that.

52:23.500 --> 52:27.140
 And so much of the ability to actually work hard

52:27.140 --> 52:29.620
 is the ability to have multiple things to choose from

52:29.620 --> 52:33.100
 and to use your time on the most appropriate thing.

52:33.100 --> 52:36.940
 There are time periods where it's the best time

52:36.940 --> 52:38.460
 for me to read a new research paper

52:38.460 --> 52:41.380
 that I need to really be thinking hard about it.

52:41.380 --> 52:43.420
 Then there's a time that maybe I should just scan

52:43.420 --> 52:44.760
 and organize my old notes

52:44.760 --> 52:47.160
 because I'm just not on top of things.

52:47.160 --> 52:48.420
 Then there's the time that,

52:48.420 --> 52:51.520
 all right, let's go bang out a few hundred lines of code

52:51.520 --> 52:52.700
 for something.

52:52.700 --> 52:57.180
 So switching between them has been real valuable.

52:57.180 --> 52:59.780
 So you'll always have kind of joy in your heart

52:59.780 --> 53:01.000
 for all the things you're doing,

53:01.000 --> 53:03.260
 and that is a kind of work life balance

53:03.260 --> 53:04.820
 as a first sort of step.

53:04.820 --> 53:06.420
 Yeah, I do. So you're always happy.

53:06.420 --> 53:07.260
 I do.

53:07.260 --> 53:08.460
 Well, happy.

53:08.460 --> 53:10.420
 Yeah, I mean, that's like a lot of people would say

53:10.420 --> 53:12.580
 that often I look like kind of a grim person,

53:12.580 --> 53:15.100
 you know, with just sitting there with a neutral expression

53:15.100 --> 53:17.500
 or even like knitted brows and a frown on my face

53:17.500 --> 53:18.980
 as I'm staring at something.

53:18.980 --> 53:20.660
 That's what happiness looks like for you.

53:20.660 --> 53:24.020
 Yeah, it's kind of true where that it's like,

53:24.020 --> 53:27.300
 okay, I'm pushing through this, I'm making progress here.

53:27.300 --> 53:30.140
 I know that doesn't work for everyone.

53:30.140 --> 53:32.100
 I know it doesn't work for most people.

53:33.100 --> 53:35.460
 But what I am always trying to do in those cases

53:35.460 --> 53:37.020
 is I don't want to let somebody

53:37.020 --> 53:40.500
 that might be a person like that be told by someone else

53:40.500 --> 53:44.180
 that no, don't even try that out as an option

53:44.180 --> 53:48.740
 where work life balance versus kind of your life's work

53:48.740 --> 53:51.740
 where there's a small subset of the people

53:51.740 --> 53:55.540
 that can be very happy being obsessive about things.

53:55.540 --> 53:58.940
 And, you know, obsession can often get things done

53:58.940 --> 54:03.180
 that just practical, prudent, pedestrian work won't

54:03.180 --> 54:05.900
 or at least won't for a very long time.

54:05.900 --> 54:09.260
 There's legends of your nutritional intake

54:10.220 --> 54:11.500
 in the early days.

54:11.500 --> 54:15.580
 What can you say about sort of as a, you know,

54:15.580 --> 54:17.900
 being a programmer as a kind of athlete?

54:17.900 --> 54:21.420
 So what was the nutrition that fueled?

54:21.420 --> 54:25.780
 I have never been that great on really paying attention

54:25.780 --> 54:29.380
 to it where I'm good enough that I don't eat a lot.

54:29.380 --> 54:31.620
 You know, I've never been like a big heavy guy,

54:31.620 --> 54:34.260
 but it was interesting where one of the things

54:34.260 --> 54:36.660
 that I can remember being an unhappy teenager,

54:36.660 --> 54:38.540
 not having enough money and like,

54:38.540 --> 54:40.060
 one of the things that bothered me

54:40.060 --> 54:41.140
 about not having enough money

54:41.140 --> 54:43.380
 is I couldn't buy pizza whenever I wanted to.

54:43.380 --> 54:46.500
 So I got rich and then I bought a whole lot of pizza.

54:46.500 --> 54:50.100
 So that was defining, like, that's what being rich felt like.

54:50.100 --> 54:52.420
 A lot of the little things, like I could buy all the pizza

54:52.420 --> 54:55.740
 and comic books and video games that I wanted to.

54:55.740 --> 54:58.820
 And it really didn't take that much,

54:58.820 --> 55:00.940
 but the pizza was one of those things

55:00.940 --> 55:03.420
 that it's absolutely true that for a long time

55:03.420 --> 55:06.460
 at id Software, I had a pizza delivered every single day.

55:06.460 --> 55:09.020
 You know, the delivery guy knew me by name

55:09.020 --> 55:11.620
 and I didn't find out until years later

55:11.620 --> 55:13.860
 that apparently I was such a good customer

55:13.860 --> 55:15.780
 that they just never raised the price on me.

55:15.780 --> 55:18.820
 And I was using this six year old price for the pizzas

55:18.820 --> 55:21.500
 that they were still kind of sending my way every day.

55:21.500 --> 55:25.940
 So you were doing eating once a day or were you?

55:25.940 --> 55:26.820
 It would be spread out.

55:26.820 --> 55:28.100
 You know, you have a few pieces of pizza,

55:28.100 --> 55:29.300
 you have some more later on

55:29.300 --> 55:31.820
 and I'd maybe have something at home.

55:31.820 --> 55:34.580
 It was one of the nice things that Facebook Meta

55:34.580 --> 55:36.820
 is they feed you quite well.

55:36.820 --> 55:39.460
 You get a different, I guess now it's DoorDash

55:39.460 --> 55:40.580
 sorts of things delivered,

55:40.580 --> 55:42.580
 but they take care of making sure

55:42.580 --> 55:44.340
 that everybody does get well fed.

55:44.340 --> 55:47.460
 And I probably had better food those six years

55:47.460 --> 55:49.540
 that I was working in the Meta office there

55:49.540 --> 55:51.620
 than I used to before.

55:51.620 --> 55:53.860
 But it's worked out okay for me.

55:53.860 --> 55:55.220
 My health has always been good.

55:55.220 --> 55:57.700
 I get a pretty good amount of exercise

55:57.700 --> 55:59.940
 and I don't eat to excess

55:59.940 --> 56:02.660
 and I avoid a lot of other kind of not so good

56:02.660 --> 56:03.660
 for you things.

56:03.660 --> 56:05.620
 So I'm still doing quite well at my age.

56:05.620 --> 56:10.140
 Did you have a kind of, I don't know,

56:10.140 --> 56:13.620
 spiritual experience with food or coffee

56:13.620 --> 56:15.060
 or any of that kind of stuff?

56:15.060 --> 56:17.500
 I mean, you know, the programming experience,

56:17.500 --> 56:21.300
 you know, with music or like I listen to brown noise

56:21.300 --> 56:24.300
 on a program or like creating an environment

56:24.300 --> 56:26.100
 and the things you take into your body,

56:26.100 --> 56:27.940
 just everything you construct

56:27.940 --> 56:29.580
 can become a kind of ritual

56:29.580 --> 56:32.180
 that empowers the whole process, the programming.

56:32.180 --> 56:34.620
 Did you have that relationship with pizza or?

56:34.620 --> 56:35.940
 It would really be with Diet Coke.

56:35.940 --> 56:38.060
 I mean, there still is that sense of, you know,

56:38.060 --> 56:40.500
 drop the can down, crack open the can of Diet Coke.

56:40.500 --> 56:41.860
 All right, now I mean business.

56:41.860 --> 56:44.020
 We're getting to work here.

56:44.020 --> 56:45.100
 Still to this day?

56:45.100 --> 56:45.940
 Yeah.

56:45.940 --> 56:46.860
 Is Diet Coke still a part of it?

56:46.860 --> 56:49.500
 Yeah, probably eight or nine a day.

56:49.500 --> 56:50.340
 Nice.

56:50.340 --> 56:52.060
 Okay, what about your setup?

56:52.060 --> 56:53.980
 How many screens?

56:53.980 --> 56:55.060
 What kind of keyboard?

56:55.060 --> 56:56.100
 Is there something interesting?

56:56.100 --> 57:01.100
 What kind of IDE, Emacs Vim or something modern?

57:02.020 --> 57:04.100
 Linux, what operating system laptop

57:04.100 --> 57:06.980
 or any interesting thing that brings you joy?

57:06.980 --> 57:09.140
 So I kind of migrated cultures

57:09.140 --> 57:11.420
 where early on through all of game dev,

57:11.420 --> 57:13.180
 there was sort of one culture there,

57:13.180 --> 57:14.580
 which was really quite distinct

57:14.580 --> 57:17.220
 from the more the Silicon Valley venture,

57:17.220 --> 57:19.180
 you know, culture for things.

57:19.180 --> 57:20.140
 They're different groups

57:20.140 --> 57:21.860
 and they have pretty different mores

57:21.860 --> 57:24.540
 and the way they think about things where,

57:24.540 --> 57:26.540
 and I still do think a lot of the big companies

57:26.540 --> 57:30.500
 can learn things from the hardcore game development

57:30.500 --> 57:32.940
 side of things where it still boggles my mind

57:32.940 --> 57:37.940
 how hostile to debuggers and IDEs that so much of them,

57:39.140 --> 57:41.660
 the kind of big money, get billions of dollars,

57:41.660 --> 57:44.380
 Silicon Valley venture backed funds are.

57:44.380 --> 57:45.220
 Oh, that's interesting.

57:45.220 --> 57:48.100
 Sorry, so you're saying like big companies

57:48.100 --> 57:50.180
 like Google and Meta are hostile to?

57:50.180 --> 57:52.780
 They are not big on debuggers and IDEs.

57:52.780 --> 57:55.740
 Like so much of it is like Emacs, Vim for things.

57:55.740 --> 57:58.820
 And we just assume that debuggers don't work

57:58.820 --> 58:01.060
 most of the time for the systems.

58:01.060 --> 58:03.780
 And a lot of this comes from a sort of Linux bias

58:03.780 --> 58:06.420
 on a lot of things where I did come up

58:06.420 --> 58:09.060
 through the personal computers and then the DOS

58:09.060 --> 58:14.020
 and then Windows and it was Borland tools

58:14.020 --> 58:16.740
 and then Visual Studio and.

58:16.740 --> 58:18.500
 Do you appreciate the buggers?

58:18.500 --> 58:19.340
 Very much so.

58:19.340 --> 58:22.020
 I mean, a debugger is how you get a view into a system

58:22.020 --> 58:23.860
 that's too complicated to understand.

58:23.860 --> 58:25.780
 I mean, anybody that thinks just read the code

58:25.780 --> 58:26.780
 and think about it.

58:26.780 --> 58:28.620
 That's an insane statement in the,

58:28.620 --> 58:31.020
 you can't even read all the code on a big system.

58:31.020 --> 58:34.100
 You have to do experiments on the system

58:34.100 --> 58:36.900
 and doing that by adding log statements,

58:36.900 --> 58:39.060
 recompiling and rerunning it

58:39.060 --> 58:41.140
 is an incredibly inefficient way of doing it.

58:41.140 --> 58:43.500
 I mean, yes, you can always get things done

58:43.500 --> 58:46.380
 even if you're working with stone knives and bear skins.

58:46.380 --> 58:48.780
 That is the mark of a good programmer

58:48.780 --> 58:50.420
 is that given any tools,

58:50.420 --> 58:52.500
 you will figure out a way to get it done,

58:52.500 --> 58:54.820
 but it's amazing what you can do

58:54.820 --> 58:57.140
 with sometimes much, much better tools

58:57.140 --> 58:59.900
 where instead of just going through this iterative

58:59.900 --> 59:02.100
 compile run debug cycle,

59:02.100 --> 59:05.060
 you have the old Lisp direction of like,

59:05.060 --> 59:07.020
 you've got a REPL and you're working interactively

59:07.020 --> 59:08.340
 and doing amazing things there.

59:08.340 --> 59:10.380
 But in many cases, a debugger

59:10.380 --> 59:13.380
 as a very powerful user interface that can stop,

59:13.380 --> 59:15.500
 examine all the different things in your program,

59:15.500 --> 59:16.940
 set all of these different breakpoints.

59:16.940 --> 59:20.180
 And of course you can do that with GDB or whatever there,

59:20.180 --> 59:22.780
 but this is one of the user interface

59:22.780 --> 59:23.980
 fundamental principles

59:23.980 --> 59:26.620
 where when something is complicated to do,

59:26.620 --> 59:28.460
 you won't use it very often.

59:28.460 --> 59:30.620
 There's people that will break out GDB

59:30.620 --> 59:31.940
 when they're at their wits end

59:31.940 --> 59:33.260
 and they just have beat their head

59:33.260 --> 59:35.180
 against a problem for so long.

59:35.180 --> 59:37.860
 But for somebody that kind of grew up in game dev,

59:37.860 --> 59:40.060
 it's like they were running into the debugger anyways

59:40.060 --> 59:42.140
 before they even knew there was a problem.

59:42.140 --> 59:44.820
 And you would just stop and see what was happening.

59:44.820 --> 59:46.340
 And sometimes you could fix things

59:46.340 --> 59:50.580
 even before you did one compile cycle.

59:50.580 --> 59:52.160
 You could be in the debugger and you would say,

59:52.160 --> 59:54.220
 well, I'm just going to change this right here.

59:54.220 --> 59:57.020
 And yep, that did the job and fix it and go on.

59:57.020 --> 59:57.860
 And for people who don't know,

59:57.860 --> 1:00:01.620
 GDB is a sort of popular, I guess, Linux debugger

1:00:03.060 --> 1:00:05.260
 primarily for C++.

1:00:05.260 --> 1:00:06.660
 They handle most of the languages,

1:00:06.660 --> 1:00:10.420
 but it's based on C as the original kind of Unix heritage.

1:00:10.420 --> 1:00:11.740
 And it's kind of like command line.

1:00:11.740 --> 1:00:13.340
 It's not user friendly.

1:00:13.340 --> 1:00:15.500
 It doesn't allow for clean visualizations

1:00:15.500 --> 1:00:17.180
 and you're exactly right.

1:00:17.180 --> 1:00:18.980
 So that you're using this kind of debugger

1:00:18.980 --> 1:00:21.020
 usually when you're at what's end

1:00:21.020 --> 1:00:23.380
 and there's a problem that you can't figure out why

1:00:23.380 --> 1:00:25.980
 by just looking at the codes, you have to find it.

1:00:25.980 --> 1:00:28.580
 That's how I guess normal programmers use it.

1:00:28.580 --> 1:00:30.060
 But you're saying there should be tools

1:00:30.060 --> 1:00:32.620
 that kind of visualize and help you

1:00:32.620 --> 1:00:35.300
 as part of the programming process,

1:00:35.300 --> 1:00:37.460
 just the normal programming process

1:00:37.460 --> 1:00:39.940
 to understand the code deeper.

1:00:39.940 --> 1:00:42.900
 Yeah, when I'm working on like my C, C++ code,

1:00:42.900 --> 1:00:45.540
 I'm always running it from the debugger.

1:00:45.540 --> 1:00:48.420
 Just I type in the code, I run it many times.

1:00:48.420 --> 1:00:50.220
 The first thing I do after writing code

1:00:50.220 --> 1:00:53.020
 is set a break point and step through the function.

1:00:53.020 --> 1:00:54.100
 Now other people will say, it's like,

1:00:54.100 --> 1:00:55.500
 oh, I do that in my head.

1:00:55.500 --> 1:00:57.780
 Well, your head is a faulty interpreter

1:00:57.780 --> 1:00:59.060
 of all those things there.

1:00:59.060 --> 1:01:01.020
 And I've written brand new code.

1:01:01.020 --> 1:01:01.980
 I wanna step in there

1:01:01.980 --> 1:01:03.460
 and I'm gonna single step through that,

1:01:03.460 --> 1:01:04.700
 examine lots of things

1:01:04.700 --> 1:01:08.500
 and see if it's actually doing what I expected it to.

1:01:08.500 --> 1:01:12.180
 It is a kind of companion, the debugger.

1:01:12.180 --> 1:01:14.860
 Like you're now coding in an interactive way

1:01:14.860 --> 1:01:17.700
 with another being.

1:01:17.700 --> 1:01:19.420
 The debugger is a kind of dumb being,

1:01:19.420 --> 1:01:21.340
 but it's a reliable being.

1:01:21.340 --> 1:01:22.500
 That is an interesting question

1:01:22.500 --> 1:01:25.940
 of what role does AI play in that kind of,

1:01:25.940 --> 1:01:29.500
 with codecs and these kind of ability to generate code,

1:01:29.500 --> 1:01:32.060
 that might be, you might start having tools

1:01:32.060 --> 1:01:35.900
 that understand the code in interesting deep ways

1:01:35.900 --> 1:01:37.780
 that can work with you.

1:01:37.780 --> 1:01:39.020
 There's a whole spectrum there

1:01:39.020 --> 1:01:43.100
 from static code analyzers and various kind of dynamic tools

1:01:43.100 --> 1:01:46.660
 there up to AI that can conceivably grok these programs

1:01:46.660 --> 1:01:49.060
 that literally no human can understand.

1:01:49.060 --> 1:01:51.940
 They're too big, too intertwined and too interconnected,

1:01:51.940 --> 1:01:54.940
 but it's not beyond the possibility of understanding.

1:01:54.940 --> 1:01:57.820
 It's just beyond what we can hold in our heads

1:01:57.820 --> 1:02:00.860
 as kind of mutable state while we're working on things.

1:02:00.860 --> 1:02:03.260
 And I'm a big proponent, again,

1:02:03.260 --> 1:02:06.140
 of things like static analyzers and some of that stuff

1:02:06.140 --> 1:02:10.420
 where you'll find some people that don't like being scolded

1:02:10.420 --> 1:02:12.660
 by a program for how they've written something

1:02:12.660 --> 1:02:14.100
 where it's like, oh, I know better.

1:02:14.100 --> 1:02:16.460
 And sometimes you do, but that was something

1:02:16.460 --> 1:02:20.580
 that it was very, very valuable for me

1:02:20.580 --> 1:02:23.220
 when, and not too many people get an opportunity

1:02:23.220 --> 1:02:24.060
 like this to have.

1:02:24.060 --> 1:02:26.060
 This is almost one of those spiritual experiences

1:02:26.060 --> 1:02:28.020
 as a programmer, an awakening to,

1:02:28.900 --> 1:02:30.300
 the id software code bases

1:02:30.300 --> 1:02:32.220
 were a couple of million lines of code.

1:02:32.220 --> 1:02:34.660
 And at one point I had used a few

1:02:34.660 --> 1:02:36.300
 of the different analysis tools,

1:02:36.300 --> 1:02:39.580
 but I made a point to really go through

1:02:39.580 --> 1:02:43.260
 and scrub the code base using every tool that I could find.

1:02:43.260 --> 1:02:45.620
 And it was eyeopening where we had a reputation

1:02:45.620 --> 1:02:48.740
 for having some of the most robust, strongest code,

1:02:48.740 --> 1:02:50.700
 where there were some great things

1:02:50.700 --> 1:02:52.940
 that I remember hearing from Microsoft

1:02:52.940 --> 1:02:54.980
 telling us about crashes on Xbox.

1:02:54.980 --> 1:02:56.780
 And we had this tiny number that they said

1:02:56.780 --> 1:02:59.380
 were probably literally hardware errors.

1:02:59.380 --> 1:03:01.380
 And then you have other significant titles

1:03:01.380 --> 1:03:03.380
 that just have millions of faults

1:03:03.380 --> 1:03:04.900
 that are getting recorded all the time.

1:03:04.900 --> 1:03:07.620
 So I was proud of our code on a lot of levels,

1:03:07.620 --> 1:03:10.700
 but when I took this code analysis squeegee

1:03:10.700 --> 1:03:14.420
 through everything, it was shocking

1:03:14.420 --> 1:03:16.740
 how many errors there were in there.

1:03:16.740 --> 1:03:19.780
 Things that you can say, okay, this was a copy paste,

1:03:19.780 --> 1:03:21.700
 not changing something right here.

1:03:21.700 --> 1:03:25.220
 Lots of things that were, the most common problem

1:03:25.220 --> 1:03:27.780
 was something in a printf format string

1:03:27.780 --> 1:03:30.460
 that was the wrong data type that could cause crashes there.

1:03:30.460 --> 1:03:33.340
 And you really want the warnings for things like that.

1:03:33.340 --> 1:03:36.140
 Then the next most common was missing a check for null

1:03:36.140 --> 1:03:38.420
 that could actually happen, that could blow things up.

1:03:38.420 --> 1:03:41.580
 And those are obviously like top C, C++ things.

1:03:41.580 --> 1:03:43.340
 Everybody has those problems.

1:03:43.340 --> 1:03:46.180
 But the long tail of all of the different little things

1:03:46.180 --> 1:03:49.100
 that could go wrong there, and we had good programmers

1:03:49.100 --> 1:03:51.020
 and my own code, stuff that I'd be looking at,

1:03:51.020 --> 1:03:53.700
 it's like, oh, I wrote that code, that's definitely wrong.

1:03:53.700 --> 1:03:56.100
 We've been using this for a year

1:03:56.100 --> 1:03:59.660
 and it's this submarine, this mine sitting there

1:03:59.660 --> 1:04:01.660
 waiting for us to step on.

1:04:01.660 --> 1:04:03.700
 And it was humbling.

1:04:03.700 --> 1:04:05.980
 It was, and I reached the conclusion

1:04:05.980 --> 1:04:09.380
 that anything that can be syntactically allowed

1:04:09.380 --> 1:04:13.380
 in your language, if it's gonna show up eventually

1:04:13.380 --> 1:04:15.420
 in a large enough code base,

1:04:15.420 --> 1:04:16.900
 you're not gonna, good intentions

1:04:16.900 --> 1:04:18.740
 aren't going to keep it from happening.

1:04:18.740 --> 1:04:21.820
 You need automated tools and guardrails for things.

1:04:21.820 --> 1:04:24.060
 And those start with things like static types

1:04:24.060 --> 1:04:26.980
 and or even type hints in the more dynamic languages.

1:04:26.980 --> 1:04:30.180
 But the people that rebel against that,

1:04:30.180 --> 1:04:33.660
 that basically say that slows me down doing that.

1:04:33.660 --> 1:04:35.260
 There's something to that, I get that.

1:04:35.260 --> 1:04:38.860
 I've written, I've cobbled things together in a notebook.

1:04:38.860 --> 1:04:41.020
 I'm like, wow, this is great that it just happened,

1:04:41.020 --> 1:04:42.500
 but yeah, that's kind of sketchy,

1:04:42.500 --> 1:04:44.020
 but it's working fine, I don't care.

1:04:44.020 --> 1:04:47.140
 It does come back to that value analysis

1:04:47.140 --> 1:04:49.740
 where sometimes it's right to not care.

1:04:49.740 --> 1:04:52.460
 But when you do care, if it's going to be something

1:04:52.460 --> 1:04:53.900
 that's going to live for years

1:04:53.900 --> 1:04:56.300
 and it's gonna have other people working on it,

1:04:56.300 --> 1:04:59.060
 and it's gonna be deployed to millions of people,

1:04:59.060 --> 1:05:01.180
 then you wanna use all of these tools.

1:05:01.180 --> 1:05:02.780
 You wanna be told it's like, no,

1:05:02.780 --> 1:05:04.340
 you've screwed up here, here and here.

1:05:04.340 --> 1:05:08.020
 And that does require kind of an ego check about things

1:05:08.020 --> 1:05:11.180
 where you have to be open to the fact

1:05:11.180 --> 1:05:12.260
 that everything that you're doing

1:05:12.260 --> 1:05:14.020
 is just littered with flaws.

1:05:14.020 --> 1:05:16.380
 It's not that, oh, you occasionally have a bad day.

1:05:16.380 --> 1:05:19.180
 It's just whatever stream of code you output,

1:05:19.180 --> 1:05:21.780
 there is going to be a statistical regularity of things

1:05:21.780 --> 1:05:24.140
 that you just make mistakes on.

1:05:24.140 --> 1:05:27.420
 And I do think there's the whole argument

1:05:27.420 --> 1:05:29.980
 about test driven design and unit testing

1:05:29.980 --> 1:05:33.020
 versus kind of analysis and different things.

1:05:33.020 --> 1:05:36.020
 I am more in favor of the analysis and the stuff

1:05:36.020 --> 1:05:37.660
 that just like you can't run your program

1:05:37.660 --> 1:05:40.220
 until you fix this rather than you can run it

1:05:40.220 --> 1:05:42.980
 and hopefully a unit test will catch it in some way.

1:05:42.980 --> 1:05:46.660
 Yeah, in my private code, I have asserts everywhere.

1:05:46.660 --> 1:05:47.500
 Yeah.

1:05:48.420 --> 1:05:52.340
 There's something pleasant to me, pleasurable to me

1:05:52.340 --> 1:05:55.300
 about sort of the dictatorial rule of like,

1:05:55.300 --> 1:05:57.340
 this should be true at this point.

1:05:58.340 --> 1:06:03.340
 And too many times I've made mistakes

1:06:03.420 --> 1:06:05.820
 that shouldn't have been made.

1:06:05.820 --> 1:06:08.500
 And I would assume I wouldn't be the kind of person

1:06:08.500 --> 1:06:09.340
 that would make that mistake,

1:06:09.340 --> 1:06:10.580
 but I keep making that mistake.

1:06:10.580 --> 1:06:13.940
 Therefore, an assert really catches me,

1:06:13.940 --> 1:06:15.340
 really helps all the time.

1:06:15.340 --> 1:06:19.020
 So my code, I would say like 10 to 20% of my private code

1:06:19.020 --> 1:06:21.420
 just for personal use is probably asserts.

1:06:21.420 --> 1:06:22.540
 And they're active comments.

1:06:22.540 --> 1:06:24.900
 That's one of those things that in theory,

1:06:24.900 --> 1:06:27.220
 they don't make any difference to the program.

1:06:27.220 --> 1:06:29.540
 And if it was all operating the way you expected

1:06:29.540 --> 1:06:32.740
 it would be, then they will never fire.

1:06:32.740 --> 1:06:34.660
 But even if you have it right

1:06:34.660 --> 1:06:36.820
 and you wrote the code right initially,

1:06:36.820 --> 1:06:38.380
 then circumstances change.

1:06:38.380 --> 1:06:40.860
 The world outside your program changes.

1:06:40.860 --> 1:06:42.900
 And in fact, that's one of the things

1:06:42.900 --> 1:06:45.460
 where I'm kind of fond in a lot of cases

1:06:45.460 --> 1:06:47.580
 of static array size declarations,

1:06:47.580 --> 1:06:49.860
 where I went through this period where it's like,

1:06:49.860 --> 1:06:51.980
 okay, now we have general collection classes.

1:06:51.980 --> 1:06:54.460
 We should just make everything variable

1:06:54.460 --> 1:06:57.540
 because I had this history of in the early days,

1:06:57.540 --> 1:07:00.020
 you get doom, which had some fixed limits on it.

1:07:00.020 --> 1:07:02.580
 Then everybody started making crazier and crazier things.

1:07:02.580 --> 1:07:04.180
 And they kept bumping up the different limits,

1:07:04.180 --> 1:07:06.820
 this many lines, this many sectors.

1:07:06.820 --> 1:07:09.020
 And it seemed like a good idea,

1:07:09.020 --> 1:07:10.900
 well, we should just make this completely generic.

1:07:10.900 --> 1:07:13.780
 It can go kind of go up to whatever.

1:07:13.780 --> 1:07:17.340
 And there's cases where that's the right thing to do,

1:07:17.340 --> 1:07:19.820
 but it also, the other aspect of the world

1:07:19.820 --> 1:07:23.060
 changing around you is it's good to be informed

1:07:23.060 --> 1:07:25.700
 when the world has changed more than you thought it would.

1:07:25.700 --> 1:07:28.420
 And if you've got a continuously growing collection,

1:07:28.420 --> 1:07:29.580
 you're never gonna find out.

1:07:29.580 --> 1:07:32.220
 You might have this quadratic slow down on something

1:07:32.220 --> 1:07:34.460
 where you thought, oh, I'm only ever gonna have

1:07:34.460 --> 1:07:36.900
 a handful of these, but something changes

1:07:36.900 --> 1:07:38.220
 and there's a new design style.

1:07:38.220 --> 1:07:40.780
 And all of a sudden you've got 10,000 of them.

1:07:40.780 --> 1:07:44.900
 So I kind of like in many cases, picking a number,

1:07:44.900 --> 1:07:47.580
 some nice brown power of two number

1:07:47.580 --> 1:07:49.900
 and setting it up in there and having an assert saying,

1:07:49.900 --> 1:07:52.180
 it's like, hey, you hit this limit.

1:07:52.180 --> 1:07:54.340
 You should probably think are the choices

1:07:54.340 --> 1:07:56.940
 that you've made around all of this still relevant

1:07:56.940 --> 1:07:59.260
 if somebody's using 10 times more

1:07:59.260 --> 1:08:00.340
 than you thought they would.

1:08:00.340 --> 1:08:02.620
 Yeah, this code was originally written

1:08:02.620 --> 1:08:04.420
 with this kind of worldview,

1:08:04.420 --> 1:08:06.700
 with this kind of set of constraints.

1:08:06.700 --> 1:08:09.380
 You were thinking of the world in this way.

1:08:09.380 --> 1:08:11.740
 If something breaks, that means you gotta rethink

1:08:11.740 --> 1:08:13.100
 the initial stuff.

1:08:13.100 --> 1:08:16.500
 And it's nice for it to do that.

1:08:16.500 --> 1:08:21.500
 Is there any stuff like a keyboard or monitors?

1:08:21.500 --> 1:08:23.780
 I'm a fairly pedestrian on a lot of that

1:08:23.780 --> 1:08:26.140
 where I did move to triple monitors

1:08:26.140 --> 1:08:27.660
 like in the last several years ago.

1:08:27.660 --> 1:08:30.180
 I had been dual monitor for a very long time.

1:08:30.180 --> 1:08:34.820
 And it was one of those things where probably years later

1:08:34.820 --> 1:08:36.140
 than I should have, I'm just like, well,

1:08:36.140 --> 1:08:38.660
 the video cards now generally have three output ports.

1:08:38.660 --> 1:08:40.420
 I should just put the third monitor up there.

1:08:40.420 --> 1:08:41.900
 That's been a pure win.

1:08:41.900 --> 1:08:44.380
 I've been very happy with that.

1:08:44.380 --> 1:08:47.140
 But no, I don't have fancy keyboard or mouse

1:08:47.140 --> 1:08:48.540
 or anything really going on.

1:08:48.540 --> 1:08:52.540
 The key things is an IDE that has helpful debuggers,

1:08:52.540 --> 1:08:54.100
 has helpful tools.

1:08:54.100 --> 1:08:56.980
 So it's not the Emacs Vim route and then Dicode.

1:08:56.980 --> 1:08:58.780
 Yeah, so I did spend,

1:08:58.780 --> 1:09:01.940
 I spent one of my week long retreats where I'm like,

1:09:01.940 --> 1:09:04.260
 okay, I'm gonna make myself use,

1:09:04.260 --> 1:09:05.540
 it was actually classic VI,

1:09:05.540 --> 1:09:07.380
 which I know people will say you should never have done that.

1:09:07.380 --> 1:09:09.340
 You should have just used Vim directly.

1:09:09.340 --> 1:09:11.340
 But I gave it the good try.

1:09:11.340 --> 1:09:13.980
 It's like, okay, I'm being in kind of classic

1:09:13.980 --> 1:09:15.740
 Unix developer mode here.

1:09:15.740 --> 1:09:18.580
 And I worked for a week on it.

1:09:18.580 --> 1:09:20.580
 I used Anki to like teach myself

1:09:20.580 --> 1:09:22.860
 the different little key combinations

1:09:22.860 --> 1:09:23.980
 for things like that.

1:09:23.980 --> 1:09:26.020
 And in the end, it was just like, all right,

1:09:26.020 --> 1:09:28.940
 this was kind of like my civil war reenactment phase.

1:09:28.940 --> 1:09:30.380
 It's like, I'm going out there doing it

1:09:30.380 --> 1:09:31.980
 like they used to in the old days.

1:09:31.980 --> 1:09:34.060
 And it was kind of fun in that regard.

1:09:34.060 --> 1:09:35.300
 So many people right now.

1:09:35.300 --> 1:09:38.660
 They're screaming as they're listening to this.

1:09:38.660 --> 1:09:41.180
 So again, the out is that this was not modern Vim,

1:09:41.180 --> 1:09:44.620
 but still, yes, I was very happy to get back

1:09:44.620 --> 1:09:46.820
 to my visual studio at the end.

1:09:46.820 --> 1:09:49.540
 Yeah, I'm actually, I struggle with this a lot

1:09:49.540 --> 1:09:52.100
 because I use a Kinesis keyboard

1:09:52.100 --> 1:09:55.180
 and I use Emacs primarily.

1:09:56.020 --> 1:09:59.140
 And I feel like I can, exactly as you said,

1:09:59.140 --> 1:10:00.220
 I can understand the code.

1:10:00.220 --> 1:10:01.300
 I can navigate the code.

1:10:01.300 --> 1:10:03.700
 There's a lot of stuff you could build with an Emacs

1:10:03.700 --> 1:10:04.820
 with using Lisp.

1:10:04.820 --> 1:10:07.300
 You can customize a lot of things for yourself

1:10:07.300 --> 1:10:09.900
 to help you introspect the code,

1:10:09.900 --> 1:10:11.620
 like to help you understand the code

1:10:11.620 --> 1:10:13.060
 and visualize different aspects of the code.

1:10:13.060 --> 1:10:14.500
 You can even run debuggers,

1:10:14.500 --> 1:10:18.940
 but it's work and the world moves past you

1:10:18.940 --> 1:10:21.900
 and the better and better ideas are constantly being built.

1:10:21.900 --> 1:10:25.420
 And that puts a kind of,

1:10:25.420 --> 1:10:27.220
 I need to take the same kind of retreat

1:10:27.220 --> 1:10:28.300
 as you're talking about,

1:10:28.300 --> 1:10:30.860
 but now I'm still fighting the civil war.

1:10:30.860 --> 1:10:33.220
 I need to kind of move into the 21st century.

1:10:33.220 --> 1:10:34.980
 And it does seem like the world is,

1:10:34.980 --> 1:10:37.060
 or a large chunk of the world is moving

1:10:37.060 --> 1:10:38.660
 towards visual studio code,

1:10:38.660 --> 1:10:40.420
 which is kind of interesting to me.

1:10:40.420 --> 1:10:43.260
 Again, it's the JavaScript ecosystem on the one hand

1:10:43.260 --> 1:10:45.380
 and IDs are one of those things

1:10:45.380 --> 1:10:47.860
 that you want to be infinitely fast.

1:10:47.860 --> 1:10:50.940
 You want them to just kind of immediately respond.

1:10:50.940 --> 1:10:52.500
 And like, I mean, heck, I've got,

1:10:52.500 --> 1:10:53.340
 there's someone I know,

1:10:53.340 --> 1:10:55.100
 I'm an old school game dev guy

1:10:55.100 --> 1:10:57.420
 that still uses visual studio six.

1:10:57.420 --> 1:10:59.460
 And on a modern computer,

1:10:59.460 --> 1:11:01.940
 everything is just absolutely instant

1:11:01.940 --> 1:11:02.940
 on something like that,

1:11:02.940 --> 1:11:04.620
 because it was made to work on a computer

1:11:04.620 --> 1:11:07.820
 that's 10,000 or a hundred thousand times slower.

1:11:07.820 --> 1:11:10.540
 So just everything happens immediately.

1:11:10.540 --> 1:11:13.500
 And all the modern systems just feel,

1:11:13.500 --> 1:11:15.300
 they feel so crufty when it's like,

1:11:15.300 --> 1:11:17.260
 oh, why is this refreshing the screen

1:11:17.260 --> 1:11:19.220
 and moving around and updating over here?

1:11:19.220 --> 1:11:20.660
 And something blinks down there

1:11:20.660 --> 1:11:21.820
 and you should update this.

1:11:21.820 --> 1:11:25.660
 And there are things that we've lost

1:11:25.660 --> 1:11:27.380
 with that incredible flexibility,

1:11:27.380 --> 1:11:31.060
 but lots of people get tons of value from it.

1:11:31.060 --> 1:11:33.540
 And I am super happy that that seems to be winning

1:11:33.540 --> 1:11:36.140
 over even a lot of the old Vim and Emacs people

1:11:36.140 --> 1:11:37.140
 that they're kind of like,

1:11:37.140 --> 1:11:40.060
 hey, visual studio codes, maybe not so bad.

1:11:40.060 --> 1:11:43.260
 I am, that may be the final peacekeeping solution

1:11:43.260 --> 1:11:45.620
 where everybody is reasonably happy

1:11:45.620 --> 1:11:47.900
 with something like that.

1:11:47.900 --> 1:11:50.540
 So can you explain what a dot plan file is

1:11:50.540 --> 1:11:53.420
 and what role that played in your life?

1:11:53.420 --> 1:11:55.540
 Does it still continue to play a role?

1:11:55.540 --> 1:11:58.660
 Back in the early, early days of id Software,

1:11:58.660 --> 1:12:01.180
 one of our big things that was unique with what we did

1:12:01.180 --> 1:12:04.020
 is I had adopted next stations

1:12:04.020 --> 1:12:05.660
 or kind of next step systems

1:12:05.660 --> 1:12:10.660
 from Steve Jobs's out in the woods away from Apple company.

1:12:11.660 --> 1:12:15.180
 And they were basically, it was kind of interesting

1:12:15.180 --> 1:12:17.140
 because I did not really have a background

1:12:17.140 --> 1:12:18.020
 with the Unix system.

1:12:18.020 --> 1:12:21.820
 So many of the people they get immersed in that in college

1:12:21.820 --> 1:12:26.820
 and that sets a lot of cultural expectations for them.

1:12:27.500 --> 1:12:29.300
 And I didn't have any of that,

1:12:29.300 --> 1:12:31.940
 but I knew that my background was,

1:12:31.940 --> 1:12:34.420
 I was a huge Apple II fan boy.

1:12:34.420 --> 1:12:36.420
 I was always a little suspicious of the Mac.

1:12:36.420 --> 1:12:41.380
 I was not really what kind of I wanted to go with.

1:12:41.380 --> 1:12:44.540
 But when Steve Jobs left Apple and started Next,

1:12:44.540 --> 1:12:46.940
 this computer did just seem like one of those amazing things

1:12:46.940 --> 1:12:50.460
 from the future where it had all of this cool stuff in it.

1:12:50.460 --> 1:12:53.340
 And we were still back in those days working on DOS,

1:12:53.340 --> 1:12:54.220
 everything blew up.

1:12:54.220 --> 1:12:55.540
 You had reset buttons

1:12:55.540 --> 1:12:56.980
 because your computer would just freeze.

1:12:56.980 --> 1:12:58.420
 If you're doing development work,

1:12:58.420 --> 1:12:59.940
 literally dozens of times a day,

1:12:59.940 --> 1:13:02.420
 your computer was just rebooting constantly.

1:13:02.420 --> 1:13:06.420
 And so this idea of, yes, any of the Unix workstations

1:13:06.420 --> 1:13:08.620
 would have given a stable development platform

1:13:08.620 --> 1:13:11.420
 where you don't crash and reboot all the time.

1:13:11.420 --> 1:13:15.540
 But Next also had this really amazing graphical interface

1:13:15.540 --> 1:13:17.420
 and it was great for building tools.

1:13:17.420 --> 1:13:22.420
 And it used Objective C as kind of an interesting dead end

1:13:22.500 --> 1:13:23.340
 for things like that.

1:13:23.340 --> 1:13:26.140
 So Next was Unix based, it said Objective C.

1:13:26.140 --> 1:13:27.780
 So it has a lot of the elements.

1:13:27.780 --> 1:13:28.700
 That became Mac.

1:13:28.700 --> 1:13:31.420
 I mean, the kind of reverse acquisition of Apple by Next

1:13:31.420 --> 1:13:32.780
 where that took over

1:13:32.780 --> 1:13:35.300
 and became what the modern Mac system is.

1:13:35.300 --> 1:13:37.300
 And to find some of the developer,

1:13:38.300 --> 1:13:41.540
 like the tools and the whole community.

1:13:41.540 --> 1:13:42.380
 Yeah, you've still got,

1:13:42.380 --> 1:13:43.820
 if you're programming on Apple stuff now,

1:13:43.820 --> 1:13:45.620
 there's still all these NS somethings,

1:13:45.620 --> 1:13:47.660
 which was originally Next step objects

1:13:47.660 --> 1:13:49.420
 of different kinds of things.

1:13:49.420 --> 1:13:52.900
 But one of the aspects of those Unix systems

1:13:52.900 --> 1:13:56.220
 was they had this notion of a.plan file

1:13:56.220 --> 1:14:00.220
 where a.file is an invisible file.

1:14:00.220 --> 1:14:02.060
 Usually in your home directory or something.

1:14:02.060 --> 1:14:03.700
 And there was a trivial server running

1:14:03.700 --> 1:14:05.900
 on most Unix systems at the time

1:14:05.900 --> 1:14:09.620
 that when somebody ran a trivial little command

1:14:09.620 --> 1:14:11.980
 called finger, you could do finger

1:14:11.980 --> 1:14:13.500
 and then somebody's address,

1:14:13.500 --> 1:14:15.140
 it could be anywhere on the internet

1:14:15.140 --> 1:14:16.780
 if you were connected correctly.

1:14:16.780 --> 1:14:20.740
 Then all that server would do was read the.plan file

1:14:20.740 --> 1:14:22.460
 in that user's home directory

1:14:22.460 --> 1:14:24.460
 and then just spit it out to you.

1:14:24.460 --> 1:14:27.140
 And originally the idea was that could be

1:14:27.140 --> 1:14:30.060
 whether you're on vacation, what your current project was.

1:14:30.060 --> 1:14:32.420
 It's supposed to be like the plan of what you're doing.

1:14:32.420 --> 1:14:35.700
 And people would use it for various purposes,

1:14:35.700 --> 1:14:39.220
 but all it did was dump that file over

1:14:39.220 --> 1:14:42.660
 to the terminal of whoever issued the finger command.

1:14:42.660 --> 1:14:46.820
 And at one point I started just keeping a list

1:14:46.820 --> 1:14:48.860
 of what I was doing in there,

1:14:48.860 --> 1:14:51.060
 which would be what I was working on in the day.

1:14:51.060 --> 1:14:53.620
 And I would have this little syntax.

1:14:53.620 --> 1:14:55.740
 I kind of got to myself about,

1:14:55.740 --> 1:14:57.140
 here's something that I'm working on.

1:14:57.140 --> 1:14:58.700
 I put a star when I finish it.

1:14:58.700 --> 1:15:01.380
 I could have a few other little bits of punctuation.

1:15:01.380 --> 1:15:02.900
 And at the time it was,

1:15:02.900 --> 1:15:05.540
 it started off as being just like my to do list.

1:15:05.540 --> 1:15:08.620
 And it would be these trivial, obscure little things

1:15:08.620 --> 1:15:12.740
 like I fixed something with collision detection code,

1:15:12.740 --> 1:15:14.900
 made Fireball do something different

1:15:14.900 --> 1:15:16.700
 and just little one liners that people

1:15:16.700 --> 1:15:20.060
 that were following the games could kind of decipher.

1:15:20.060 --> 1:15:24.220
 But I did wind up starting to write much more in depth things.

1:15:24.220 --> 1:15:28.460
 I would have little notes of thoughts and insights

1:15:28.460 --> 1:15:30.420
 and then I would eventually start having little essays.

1:15:30.420 --> 1:15:33.020
 I would sometimes dump into the dot plan files

1:15:33.020 --> 1:15:36.180
 interspersed with the work logs of things that I was doing.

1:15:36.180 --> 1:15:39.620
 So in some ways it was like a super early proto blog

1:15:39.620 --> 1:15:42.620
 where I was just kind of dumping out what I was working on.

1:15:42.620 --> 1:15:45.460
 But it was interesting enough that there were a lot

1:15:45.460 --> 1:15:48.740
 of people that were interested in this.

1:15:48.740 --> 1:15:51.220
 So most of the people didn't have Unix workstation.

1:15:51.220 --> 1:15:53.300
 So there were the websites back in the day

1:15:53.300 --> 1:15:55.500
 that would follow the Doom and Quake development

1:15:55.500 --> 1:15:58.380
 that would basically make a little service

1:15:58.380 --> 1:15:59.780
 that would go grab all the changes

1:15:59.780 --> 1:16:02.180
 and then people could just get it with a web browser.

1:16:02.180 --> 1:16:04.940
 And there was a period where like all of the little

1:16:04.940 --> 1:16:07.580
 kind of Dallas gaming diaspora of people

1:16:07.580 --> 1:16:09.340
 that were at all in that orbit,

1:16:09.340 --> 1:16:12.220
 there were a couple dozen plan files going on,

1:16:12.220 --> 1:16:15.460
 which was, and this was some years before blogging

1:16:15.460 --> 1:16:17.180
 really became kind of a thing.

1:16:17.180 --> 1:16:20.420
 And it was kind of a premonition

1:16:20.420 --> 1:16:22.220
 of sort of the way things would go.

1:16:22.220 --> 1:16:25.020
 And there was, it's all been collected.

1:16:25.020 --> 1:16:27.060
 It's available online in different places.

1:16:27.060 --> 1:16:29.340
 And it's kind of fun to go back and look through

1:16:29.340 --> 1:16:32.420
 what I was thinking, what I was doing in the different areas.

1:16:32.420 --> 1:16:33.780
 Have you had a chance to look back?

1:16:33.780 --> 1:16:37.340
 Is there some interesting, very low level specific

1:16:37.340 --> 1:16:40.380
 to do items, maybe things you've never completed,

1:16:40.380 --> 1:16:44.180
 all that kind of stuff and high level philosophical essay

1:16:44.180 --> 1:16:46.300
 type of stuff that stands out?

1:16:46.300 --> 1:16:48.340
 Yeah, there's some good stuff on both

1:16:48.340 --> 1:16:51.940
 where a lot of it was low level nitpicky details

1:16:51.940 --> 1:16:55.820
 about game dev and I've learned enough things

1:16:55.820 --> 1:16:58.300
 where there's no project that I worked on

1:16:58.300 --> 1:17:00.620
 that I couldn't go back and do a better job on now.

1:17:00.620 --> 1:17:02.380
 I mean, you just, you learn things,

1:17:02.380 --> 1:17:03.820
 hopefully if you're doing it right,

1:17:03.820 --> 1:17:05.340
 you learn things as you get older

1:17:05.340 --> 1:17:07.300
 and you should be able to do a better job

1:17:07.300 --> 1:17:08.700
 at all of the early things.

1:17:08.700 --> 1:17:12.220
 And there's stuff in Wolfenstein Doomquake that's like,

1:17:12.220 --> 1:17:15.780
 oh, clearly I could go back and do a better job at this,

1:17:15.780 --> 1:17:17.860
 whether it's something in the rendering engine side

1:17:17.860 --> 1:17:20.940
 or how I implemented the monster behaviors

1:17:20.940 --> 1:17:22.780
 or managed resources or anything like that.

1:17:22.780 --> 1:17:24.980
 Do you see the flaws in your thinking now?

1:17:24.980 --> 1:17:26.220
 Like looking back?

1:17:26.220 --> 1:17:27.060
 Yeah, I do.

1:17:27.060 --> 1:17:29.060
 I mean, sometimes I'll get the,

1:17:29.060 --> 1:17:31.500
 I'll look at it and say, yeah, I had a pretty clear view

1:17:31.500 --> 1:17:33.940
 of I was doing good work there.

1:17:33.940 --> 1:17:35.940
 And I haven't really hit the point

1:17:35.940 --> 1:17:38.740
 where there was another programmer, Graham Devine,

1:17:38.740 --> 1:17:41.740
 who was, he had worked at ID and Seventh Guest

1:17:41.740 --> 1:17:43.700
 and he made some comment one time

1:17:43.700 --> 1:17:45.660
 where he said he looked back at some of his old notes

1:17:45.660 --> 1:17:48.740
 and he was like, wow, I was really smart back then.

1:17:48.740 --> 1:17:52.140
 And I don't hit that so much where,

1:17:52.140 --> 1:17:54.300
 I mean, I look at it and I always know that,

1:17:54.300 --> 1:17:56.500
 yeah, there's all the, you know, with aging,

1:17:56.500 --> 1:18:00.060
 you get certain changes in how you're able to work problems,

1:18:00.060 --> 1:18:02.260
 but all of the problems that I've worked,

1:18:02.260 --> 1:18:06.260
 I'm sure that I could do a better job on all of them.

1:18:06.260 --> 1:18:07.100
 Oh, wow.

1:18:07.100 --> 1:18:08.380
 So you can still step right in.

1:18:08.380 --> 1:18:10.900
 If you could travel back in time and talk to that guy,

1:18:10.900 --> 1:18:12.060
 you would teach him a few things.

1:18:12.060 --> 1:18:13.020
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:18:14.260 --> 1:18:15.860
 That's awesome.

1:18:15.860 --> 1:18:18.020
 What about the high level philosophical stuff?

1:18:18.020 --> 1:18:20.620
 Is there some insights that stand out that you remember?

1:18:20.620 --> 1:18:25.340
 There's things that I was understanding about development

1:18:25.340 --> 1:18:28.140
 and, you know, in the industry and so on

1:18:28.140 --> 1:18:31.300
 that were in a more primitive stage

1:18:31.300 --> 1:18:36.300
 where I definitely learned a lot more in the later years

1:18:36.620 --> 1:18:41.300
 about business and organization and team structure.

1:18:41.300 --> 1:18:44.580
 There were, I mean, there were definitely things

1:18:44.580 --> 1:18:46.820
 that I was not the best person

1:18:46.820 --> 1:18:48.900
 or even a very good person about managing,

1:18:48.900 --> 1:18:51.580
 like how a team should operate internally,

1:18:51.580 --> 1:18:53.420
 how people should work together.

1:18:53.420 --> 1:18:57.420
 I was just, you know, just get out of my way

1:18:57.420 --> 1:18:59.500
 and let me work on the code and do this.

1:18:59.500 --> 1:19:02.260
 And more and more, I've learned how,

1:19:03.420 --> 1:19:04.980
 in the larger scheme of things,

1:19:04.980 --> 1:19:07.220
 how sometimes relatively unimportant

1:19:07.220 --> 1:19:08.340
 some of those things are,

1:19:08.340 --> 1:19:11.020
 where it is this user value generation

1:19:11.020 --> 1:19:14.060
 that's the overarching importance for all of that.

1:19:14.060 --> 1:19:17.940
 And I didn't necessarily have my eye on that ball correctly

1:19:17.940 --> 1:19:21.180
 through a lot of my, you know, my earlier years.

1:19:21.180 --> 1:19:23.380
 And there's things that, you know,

1:19:23.380 --> 1:19:25.580
 I could have gotten more out of people

1:19:25.580 --> 1:19:27.460
 handling things in different ways.

1:19:27.460 --> 1:19:29.780
 I am, you know, I could have made, you know,

1:19:29.780 --> 1:19:32.020
 in some ways more successful products

1:19:32.020 --> 1:19:33.820
 by following things in different ways.

1:19:33.820 --> 1:19:35.340
 There's mistakes that we made

1:19:35.340 --> 1:19:37.180
 that we couldn't really have known

1:19:37.180 --> 1:19:38.500
 how things would have worked out,

1:19:38.500 --> 1:19:41.220
 but it was interesting to see in later years companies

1:19:41.220 --> 1:19:42.380
 like Activision showing that,

1:19:42.380 --> 1:19:44.980
 hey, you really can just do the same game,

1:19:44.980 --> 1:19:46.580
 make it better every year.

1:19:46.580 --> 1:19:48.540
 And you can look at that from a negative standpoint

1:19:48.540 --> 1:19:50.500
 and say, it's like, oh, that's just being derivative

1:19:50.500 --> 1:19:51.460
 and all that.

1:19:51.460 --> 1:19:53.580
 But if you step back again and say, it's like, no,

1:19:53.580 --> 1:19:55.460
 are the people buying it still enjoying it?

1:19:55.460 --> 1:19:56.500
 Are they enjoying it more

1:19:56.500 --> 1:19:59.060
 than what they might have bought otherwise?

1:19:59.060 --> 1:20:00.900
 And you can say, no, that's actually

1:20:00.900 --> 1:20:03.660
 a great value creation engine to do that

1:20:03.660 --> 1:20:05.980
 if you're in a position where you can.

1:20:05.980 --> 1:20:09.260
 I, you know, don't be forced into reinventing everything

1:20:09.260 --> 1:20:11.300
 just because you think that you need to.

1:20:12.740 --> 1:20:15.860
 You know, lots of things about business and team stuff

1:20:15.860 --> 1:20:18.460
 that could be done better, but the technical work,

1:20:18.460 --> 1:20:20.740
 the kind of technical visionary type stuff

1:20:20.740 --> 1:20:23.860
 that I laid out, I still feel pretty good about.

1:20:23.860 --> 1:20:26.540
 There are some classic old ones about my defending

1:20:26.540 --> 1:20:29.220
 of OpenGL versus D3D,

1:20:29.220 --> 1:20:32.180
 which turned out to be one of the more

1:20:32.180 --> 1:20:34.420
 probably important momentous things there

1:20:34.420 --> 1:20:38.820
 where it never, it was always a rear guard action on Windows

1:20:38.820 --> 1:20:42.260
 where Microsoft was just not gonna let that win.

1:20:42.260 --> 1:20:44.300
 But when I look back on it now,

1:20:44.300 --> 1:20:46.660
 that fight to keep OpenGL relevant

1:20:46.660 --> 1:20:48.740
 for a number of years there

1:20:48.740 --> 1:20:52.580
 meant that OpenGL was there when mobile started happening

1:20:52.580 --> 1:20:55.580
 and OpenGL ES was the thing that drove

1:20:55.580 --> 1:20:58.540
 all of the acceleration of the mobile industry.

1:20:58.540 --> 1:21:00.860
 And it's really only in the last few years

1:21:00.860 --> 1:21:02.460
 as Apple's moved to Metal

1:21:02.460 --> 1:21:04.980
 and some of the other companies have moved to Vulkan

1:21:04.980 --> 1:21:06.700
 that that's moved away.

1:21:06.700 --> 1:21:09.420
 But really stepping back and looking at it,

1:21:09.420 --> 1:21:11.900
 it's like, yeah, I sold tens of millions of games

1:21:11.900 --> 1:21:13.580
 for different things.

1:21:13.580 --> 1:21:17.380
 But billions and billions of devices wound up

1:21:17.380 --> 1:21:21.220
 with an appropriate capable graphics API

1:21:21.220 --> 1:21:23.740
 due in no small part to me thinking

1:21:23.740 --> 1:21:25.180
 that that was really important

1:21:25.180 --> 1:21:29.100
 that we not just give up and use Microsoft's

1:21:30.540 --> 1:21:32.900
 at that time really terrible API.

1:21:32.900 --> 1:21:35.820
 The thing about Microsoft is the APIs don't stay terrible.

1:21:35.820 --> 1:21:38.940
 They were terrible at the start, but a few versions on,

1:21:38.940 --> 1:21:40.060
 they were actually quite good.

1:21:40.060 --> 1:21:42.460
 And there was a completely fair argument to be made

1:21:42.460 --> 1:21:45.020
 that by the time DX9 was out,

1:21:45.020 --> 1:21:47.220
 it was probably a better programming environment

1:21:47.220 --> 1:21:51.100
 than OpenGL, but it was still a wonderful good thing

1:21:51.100 --> 1:21:52.540
 that we had an open standard

1:21:52.540 --> 1:21:55.740
 that could show up on Linux and Android and iOS

1:21:55.740 --> 1:21:58.620
 and eventually WebGL still to this day.

1:21:58.620 --> 1:22:02.620
 So that was one, that would be on my greatest hits list

1:22:02.620 --> 1:22:04.460
 of things that I kind of pushed with.

1:22:04.460 --> 1:22:07.700
 The impact it had on billions of devices, yes.

1:22:07.700 --> 1:22:08.940
 So let's talk about it.

1:22:08.940 --> 1:22:12.380
 Can you tell the origin story of id Software?

1:22:12.380 --> 1:22:16.340
 Again, one of the greatest game developer companies ever.

1:22:16.340 --> 1:22:18.900
 It created Wolfenstein 3D games

1:22:18.900 --> 1:22:22.580
 that defined my life also in many ways

1:22:22.580 --> 1:22:24.280
 as a thing that made me realize

1:22:24.280 --> 1:22:26.700
 what computers are capable of in terms of graphics,

1:22:26.700 --> 1:22:30.260
 in terms of performance, it just unlocked something deep

1:22:31.620 --> 1:22:34.220
 in me and understanding what these machines are all about

1:22:34.220 --> 1:22:35.140
 as games can do that.

1:22:35.140 --> 1:22:37.420
 So Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Quake,

1:22:37.420 --> 1:22:40.700
 and just all the incredible engineering innovation

1:22:40.700 --> 1:22:41.780
 that went into that.

1:22:41.780 --> 1:22:44.300
 So how did it all start?

1:22:44.300 --> 1:22:45.940
 So I'll caveat upfront

1:22:45.940 --> 1:22:49.460
 that I usually don't consider myself the historian

1:22:49.460 --> 1:22:51.480
 of the software side of things.

1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:55.020
 I usually do kind of point people at John Romero

1:22:55.020 --> 1:23:00.020
 for stories about the early days where I've never been,

1:23:00.140 --> 1:23:01.780
 like I've commented that I'm a remarkably

1:23:01.780 --> 1:23:03.980
 unsentimental person in some ways

1:23:03.980 --> 1:23:05.780
 where I don't really spend a lot of time

1:23:05.780 --> 1:23:07.980
 unless I'm explicitly prodded to go back

1:23:07.980 --> 1:23:10.300
 and think about the early days of things.

1:23:10.300 --> 1:23:14.660
 And I didn't necessarily make the effort

1:23:14.660 --> 1:23:17.100
 to archive everything exactly in my brain.

1:23:17.100 --> 1:23:19.460
 And the more that I work on machine learning and AI

1:23:19.460 --> 1:23:20.880
 and the aspects of memory

1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:23.360
 and how when you go back and polish certain things,

1:23:23.360 --> 1:23:25.920
 it's not necessarily exactly the way it happened.

1:23:25.920 --> 1:23:29.580
 But having said all of that, from my view,

1:23:29.580 --> 1:23:32.680
 the way everything happened that led up to that was

1:23:34.220 --> 1:23:36.140
 after I was an adult

1:23:36.140 --> 1:23:38.140
 and kind of taking a few college classes

1:23:38.140 --> 1:23:40.860
 and deciding to drop out, I was doing,

1:23:40.860 --> 1:23:43.620
 I was hardscrabble contract programming work,

1:23:43.620 --> 1:23:46.220
 really struggling to kind of keep groceries

1:23:46.220 --> 1:23:48.140
 and pay my rent and things.

1:23:48.140 --> 1:23:50.560
 And the company that I was doing the most work for

1:23:50.560 --> 1:23:53.180
 was a company called Softdisk Publishing,

1:23:53.180 --> 1:23:57.100
 which had the sounds bizarre now business model

1:23:57.100 --> 1:23:59.780
 of monthly subscription software.

1:23:59.780 --> 1:24:02.300
 Before there was an internet that people could connect to

1:24:02.300 --> 1:24:05.780
 and get software, you would pay a certain amount

1:24:05.780 --> 1:24:07.540
 and every month they would send you a disc

1:24:07.540 --> 1:24:09.780
 that had some random software on it.

1:24:09.780 --> 1:24:11.460
 And people that were into computers

1:24:11.460 --> 1:24:12.740
 thought this was kind of cool.

1:24:12.740 --> 1:24:14.980
 And they had different ones for the Apple II,

1:24:14.980 --> 1:24:18.900
 the 2GS, the PC, the Mac, the Amiga,

1:24:18.900 --> 1:24:20.060
 lots of different things here.

1:24:20.060 --> 1:24:21.440
 So quirky little business,

1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:24.580
 but I was doing a lot of contract programming for them

1:24:24.580 --> 1:24:26.460
 where I'd write tiny little games

1:24:26.460 --> 1:24:29.980
 and sell them for 300, $500.

1:24:29.980 --> 1:24:32.920
 And one of the things that I was doing again

1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:35.080
 to keep my head above water here was

1:24:35.080 --> 1:24:38.020
 I decided that I could make one program

1:24:38.020 --> 1:24:41.060
 and I could port it to multiple systems.

1:24:41.060 --> 1:24:44.900
 So I would write a game like Dark Designs or Catacombs

1:24:44.900 --> 1:24:47.940
 and I would develop it on the Apple II, the 2GS

1:24:47.940 --> 1:24:51.780
 and the IBM PC, which apparently was the thing

1:24:51.780 --> 1:24:54.300
 that really kind of piqued the attention

1:24:54.300 --> 1:24:56.420
 of the people working down there.

1:24:56.420 --> 1:24:58.500
 Like Jay Wilbur was my primary editor

1:24:58.500 --> 1:25:01.220
 and Tom Hall was a secondary editor.

1:25:01.220 --> 1:25:02.700
 And they kept asking me, it's like,

1:25:02.700 --> 1:25:06.060
 hey, you should come down and work for us here.

1:25:06.060 --> 1:25:08.300
 And I pushed it off a couple of times

1:25:08.300 --> 1:25:10.300
 because I was really enjoying my freedom

1:25:10.300 --> 1:25:11.840
 of kind of being off on my own.

1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:14.700
 Even if I was barely getting by, I loved it.

1:25:14.700 --> 1:25:17.760
 I was doing nothing but programming all day,

1:25:17.760 --> 1:25:20.500
 but I did have enough close scrapes with like,

1:25:20.500 --> 1:25:21.980
 damn, I'm just really out of money

1:25:21.980 --> 1:25:25.020
 that maybe I should get an actual job

1:25:25.020 --> 1:25:27.940
 rather than contracting these kind of one at a time things.

1:25:27.940 --> 1:25:29.400
 And Jay Wilbur was great.

1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:32.020
 He was like FedExing me the checks when I would need them.

1:25:32.020 --> 1:25:35.700
 I had to kind of get over whatever hump I was at.

1:25:35.700 --> 1:25:38.720
 So I took the, I finally took them up on their offer

1:25:38.720 --> 1:25:41.260
 to come down to Shreveport, Louisiana.

1:25:41.260 --> 1:25:43.820
 I was in Kansas city at the time,

1:25:43.820 --> 1:25:47.320
 drove down to through the Ozarks and everything

1:25:47.320 --> 1:25:51.820
 down to Louisiana and saw the soft disk offices,

1:25:51.820 --> 1:25:53.740
 went through, talked to a bunch of people,

1:25:53.740 --> 1:25:56.520
 met the people I had been working with remotely

1:25:56.520 --> 1:25:57.800
 at that time.

1:25:57.800 --> 1:25:59.180
 But the most important thing for me

1:25:59.180 --> 1:26:01.740
 was I met two programmers there,

1:26:01.740 --> 1:26:04.780
 John Romero and Lane Roth that for the first time ever,

1:26:04.780 --> 1:26:08.500
 I had met programmers that knew more cool stuff than I did

1:26:08.500 --> 1:26:11.020
 where the world was just different back then.

1:26:11.020 --> 1:26:12.420
 I was in Kansas city.

1:26:12.420 --> 1:26:14.620
 It was one of those smartest kid in the school

1:26:14.620 --> 1:26:15.980
 does all the computer stuff.

1:26:15.980 --> 1:26:18.140
 The teachers don't have anything to teach him.

1:26:18.140 --> 1:26:20.320
 But all I had to learn from was these few books

1:26:20.320 --> 1:26:21.260
 at the library.

1:26:21.260 --> 1:26:23.100
 It was not much at all.

1:26:23.100 --> 1:26:25.220
 And there were some aspects of programming

1:26:25.220 --> 1:26:27.220
 that were kind of black magic to me.

1:26:27.220 --> 1:26:30.180
 Like, it's like, oh, he knows how to format a track on,

1:26:30.180 --> 1:26:34.300
 I am on a low level drive programming interface.

1:26:34.300 --> 1:26:37.380
 And this was, I was still not at all sure

1:26:37.380 --> 1:26:38.560
 I was gonna take the job,

1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:40.820
 but I met these awesome programmers

1:26:40.820 --> 1:26:42.300
 that were doing cool stuff.

1:26:42.300 --> 1:26:44.380
 And Romero had worked at Origin Systems

1:26:44.380 --> 1:26:49.020
 and he had done like, so many different games ahead of time

1:26:49.020 --> 1:26:50.740
 that I did kind of quickly decide,

1:26:50.740 --> 1:26:53.220
 it's like, yeah, I'll go take the job down there.

1:26:53.220 --> 1:26:57.100
 And I settled down there, moved in

1:26:57.100 --> 1:26:59.780
 and started working on more little projects.

1:26:59.780 --> 1:27:03.060
 And the first kind of big change that happened down there

1:27:03.060 --> 1:27:05.620
 was the company wanted to make a gaming focused,

1:27:05.620 --> 1:27:08.260
 a PC gaming focused subscription.

1:27:08.260 --> 1:27:09.180
 Just like all their other,

1:27:09.180 --> 1:27:11.880
 it was the same formula that they used for everything.

1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:14.760
 Pay a monthly fee and you'll get a disc

1:27:14.760 --> 1:27:16.940
 with one or two games just every month

1:27:16.940 --> 1:27:19.860
 and no choice in what you get, but we think it'll be fun.

1:27:19.860 --> 1:27:21.980
 And that was the model they were comfortable with

1:27:21.980 --> 1:27:22.820
 and they said, all right,

1:27:22.820 --> 1:27:25.140
 we're gonna start this gamers edge department.

1:27:25.140 --> 1:27:27.860
 And all of us that were interested in that,

1:27:27.860 --> 1:27:31.420
 like me, Romero, Tom Hall was kind of helping us

1:27:31.420 --> 1:27:34.100
 from his side of things, Jay would peek in

1:27:34.100 --> 1:27:37.160
 and we had a few other programmers working with us

1:27:37.160 --> 1:27:38.220
 at the time.

1:27:38.220 --> 1:27:41.260
 And we were going to just start making games,

1:27:41.260 --> 1:27:43.400
 just the same model.

1:27:43.400 --> 1:27:45.860
 And we dived in and it was fantastic.

1:27:45.860 --> 1:27:47.560
 Do you have to make new games?

1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:48.400
 Every month.

1:27:48.400 --> 1:27:49.220
 Every month.

1:27:49.220 --> 1:27:50.060
 Yeah.

1:27:50.060 --> 1:27:52.740
 And this, in retrospect, looking back at it,

1:27:52.740 --> 1:27:55.380
 that sense that I had done all this contract programming

1:27:55.380 --> 1:27:58.060
 and John Romero had done like far more of this

1:27:58.060 --> 1:28:00.900
 where he had done one of his teaching himself efforts

1:28:00.900 --> 1:28:03.420
 was he made a game for every letter of the alphabet.

1:28:03.420 --> 1:28:04.260
 It's that sense of like,

1:28:04.260 --> 1:28:06.260
 I'm just gonna go make 26 different games,

1:28:06.260 --> 1:28:07.700
 give them a different theme.

1:28:07.700 --> 1:28:10.300
 And you learn so much when you go through

1:28:10.300 --> 1:28:12.180
 and you crank these things out

1:28:12.180 --> 1:28:14.580
 like on a biweekly, monthly basis,

1:28:14.580 --> 1:28:16.060
 something like that. From start to finish.

1:28:16.060 --> 1:28:17.860
 It's not like just an idea.

1:28:17.860 --> 1:28:21.760
 It's not just from the very beginning to the very end.

1:28:21.760 --> 1:28:22.860
 It's done.

1:28:22.860 --> 1:28:24.300
 It has to be done.

1:28:24.300 --> 1:28:25.300
 There's no delaying.

1:28:25.300 --> 1:28:26.140
 It's done.

1:28:26.140 --> 1:28:26.980
 And you've got deadlines.

1:28:26.980 --> 1:28:31.980
 And that kind of rapid iteration pressure cooker environment

1:28:32.100 --> 1:28:35.300
 was super important for all of us developing the skills

1:28:35.300 --> 1:28:38.500
 that brought us to where we eventually went to.

1:28:38.500 --> 1:28:39.980
 I mean, people would say like,

1:28:39.980 --> 1:28:41.180
 like in the history of the Beatles,

1:28:41.180 --> 1:28:43.100
 like it wasn't them being the Beatles.

1:28:43.100 --> 1:28:46.060
 It was them playing all of these other early works

1:28:46.060 --> 1:28:48.340
 that that opportunity to craft all of their skills

1:28:48.340 --> 1:28:49.820
 before they were famous,

1:28:49.820 --> 1:28:53.000
 that was very critical to their later successes.

1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:54.940
 And I think there's a lot of that here

1:28:54.940 --> 1:28:58.740
 where we did these games that nobody remembers,

1:28:58.740 --> 1:29:00.940
 lots of little things that contributed

1:29:00.940 --> 1:29:02.900
 to building up the skillset for the things

1:29:02.900 --> 1:29:05.340
 that eventually did make us famous.

1:29:05.340 --> 1:29:08.340
 Yeah, Dostoevsky wrote The Gambler.

1:29:08.340 --> 1:29:12.420
 I had to write it in a month, just to make money.

1:29:12.420 --> 1:29:14.620
 And nobody remembers that probably

1:29:14.620 --> 1:29:15.820
 because he had to figure out,

1:29:15.820 --> 1:29:17.140
 because it's literally,

1:29:17.980 --> 1:29:21.140
 he didn't have enough time to write it fast enough.

1:29:21.140 --> 1:29:23.060
 So he had to come up with hacks.

1:29:23.060 --> 1:29:23.900
 Literally,

1:29:23.900 --> 1:29:25.220
 it again comes down to that point

1:29:25.220 --> 1:29:28.260
 where pressure and limitation of resources

1:29:28.260 --> 1:29:30.340
 is surprisingly important.

1:29:30.340 --> 1:29:32.580
 And it's counterintuitive in a lot of ways

1:29:32.580 --> 1:29:34.340
 where you just think that if you've got all the time

1:29:34.340 --> 1:29:36.580
 in the world and you've got all the resources in the world,

1:29:36.580 --> 1:29:38.420
 of course, you're gonna get something better.

1:29:38.420 --> 1:29:40.380
 But sometimes it really does work out

1:29:40.380 --> 1:29:44.420
 that the innovations, mother necessity,

1:29:44.420 --> 1:29:46.440
 where you can, or resource constraints,

1:29:46.440 --> 1:29:49.300
 and you have to do things when you don't have a choice.

1:29:49.300 --> 1:29:50.740
 It's surprising what you can do.

1:29:50.740 --> 1:29:52.740
 Is there any good games written in that time?

1:29:52.740 --> 1:29:53.580
 Would you say?

1:29:53.580 --> 1:29:55.700
 Some of them are still fun to go back and play

1:29:55.700 --> 1:29:57.220
 where you get the,

1:29:58.220 --> 1:29:59.900
 they were all about kind of,

1:29:59.900 --> 1:30:01.820
 the more modern term is game feel,

1:30:01.820 --> 1:30:04.140
 about how just the exact feel that things,

1:30:04.140 --> 1:30:06.260
 it's not the grand strategy of the design,

1:30:06.260 --> 1:30:08.860
 but how running and jumping and shooting

1:30:08.860 --> 1:30:11.780
 and those things I feel in the moment.

1:30:11.780 --> 1:30:13.420
 And some of those are still,

1:30:13.420 --> 1:30:15.180
 if you sat down on them, you kind of go,

1:30:15.180 --> 1:30:16.060
 it's a little bit different.

1:30:16.060 --> 1:30:17.780
 It doesn't have the same movement feel,

1:30:17.780 --> 1:30:20.780
 but you move over and you're like, bang, jump, bang.

1:30:20.780 --> 1:30:23.180
 It's like, hey, that's kind of cool still.

1:30:23.180 --> 1:30:25.980
 So you can get lost in the rhythm of the game.

1:30:25.980 --> 1:30:27.820
 Is that what you mean by feel?

1:30:27.820 --> 1:30:31.380
 Just like there's something about it that pulls you in?

1:30:31.380 --> 1:30:33.820
 Nowadays, again, people talk about compulsion loops

1:30:33.820 --> 1:30:37.220
 and things where it's that sense of exactly

1:30:37.220 --> 1:30:38.900
 what you're doing, what your fingers are doing

1:30:38.900 --> 1:30:41.140
 on the keyboard, what your eyes are seeing,

1:30:41.140 --> 1:30:43.300
 and there are gonna be these sequences of things.

1:30:43.300 --> 1:30:44.860
 Grab the loot, shoot the monster,

1:30:44.860 --> 1:30:47.020
 jump over the obstacle, get to the end of the level.

1:30:47.020 --> 1:30:50.620
 These are eternal aspects of game design in a lot of ways,

1:30:50.620 --> 1:30:53.300
 but there are better and worse ways to do all of them.

1:30:53.300 --> 1:30:55.380
 And we did so many of these games

1:30:55.380 --> 1:30:58.820
 that we got a lot of practice with it.

1:30:58.820 --> 1:31:01.060
 So one of the kind of weird things

1:31:01.060 --> 1:31:02.460
 that was happening at this time

1:31:02.460 --> 1:31:06.740
 is John Romero was getting some strange fan mail.

1:31:06.740 --> 1:31:09.140
 And back in the days, this was before email.

1:31:09.140 --> 1:31:12.420
 So we literally got letters sometimes and telling him,

1:31:12.420 --> 1:31:14.340
 it's like, oh, I wanna talk to you about your games.

1:31:14.340 --> 1:31:17.100
 I wanna reach out, different things.

1:31:17.100 --> 1:31:19.660
 And eventually it turned out

1:31:19.660 --> 1:31:21.980
 that these were all coming from Scott Miller

1:31:21.980 --> 1:31:23.980
 at Apogee Software.

1:31:23.980 --> 1:31:26.300
 And he was reaching out through,

1:31:26.300 --> 1:31:28.300
 he didn't think he could contact John directly,

1:31:28.300 --> 1:31:29.540
 that he would get intercepted.

1:31:29.540 --> 1:31:31.700
 So he was trying to get him to contact him

1:31:31.700 --> 1:31:34.260
 through like back channel fan mail,

1:31:34.260 --> 1:31:35.460
 because he basically was saying,

1:31:35.460 --> 1:31:38.540
 hey, I'm making all this money on shareware games.

1:31:38.540 --> 1:31:40.860
 I want you to make shareware games,

1:31:40.860 --> 1:31:42.580
 because he had seen some of the games

1:31:42.580 --> 1:31:44.500
 that Romero had done.

1:31:44.500 --> 1:31:47.780
 And we looked at Scott Miller's games

1:31:47.780 --> 1:31:50.500
 and we didn't think they were very good.

1:31:50.500 --> 1:31:53.100
 We're like, that can't be making the kind of money

1:31:53.100 --> 1:31:56.220
 that he's saying he's making 10 grand or something

1:31:56.220 --> 1:31:57.140
 off of this game.

1:31:57.140 --> 1:31:59.380
 And we really thought that he was full of shit,

1:31:59.380 --> 1:32:03.140
 that it was a lie trying to get him into this.

1:32:03.140 --> 1:32:07.100
 But so that was kind of going on at one level.

1:32:07.980 --> 1:32:10.180
 And it was funny the moment when Romero realized

1:32:10.180 --> 1:32:12.500
 that he had some of these letters pinned up on his wall,

1:32:12.500 --> 1:32:13.540
 like all of his fans.

1:32:13.540 --> 1:32:15.380
 And then we noticed that they all had the same return

1:32:15.380 --> 1:32:17.340
 address with different names on them,

1:32:17.340 --> 1:32:19.860
 which was a little bit of a two edged sword there.

1:32:19.860 --> 1:32:23.420
 Trying to figure out the puzzle laid out before him.

1:32:23.420 --> 1:32:26.660
 Yeah, what happened after I kind of coincident with that

1:32:26.660 --> 1:32:29.860
 was I was working on a lot of the new technologies

1:32:29.860 --> 1:32:33.860
 where I was now full on the IBM PC for the first time,

1:32:33.860 --> 1:32:37.220
 where I was really a long hold out on Apple II forever.

1:32:37.220 --> 1:32:38.980
 And I loved my Apple II.

1:32:38.980 --> 1:32:40.660
 It was the computer I always wished I had

1:32:40.660 --> 1:32:41.700
 when I was growing up.

1:32:41.700 --> 1:32:43.140
 And when I finally did have one,

1:32:43.140 --> 1:32:46.180
 I was kind of clinging on to that well past it

1:32:46.180 --> 1:32:47.540
 sort of good use by day.

1:32:47.540 --> 1:32:50.740
 Is it the best computer ever made you would you say?

1:32:50.740 --> 1:32:53.180
 I wouldn't make judgments like that about it,

1:32:53.180 --> 1:32:54.740
 but it was positioned in such a way,

1:32:54.740 --> 1:32:57.660
 especially in the school systems that it impacted

1:32:57.660 --> 1:33:00.420
 a whole lot of American programmers at least,

1:33:00.420 --> 1:33:02.940
 where there was programs that the Apple IIs

1:33:02.940 --> 1:33:05.980
 got into the schools and they had enough capability

1:33:05.980 --> 1:33:08.780
 that lots of interesting things happened with them.

1:33:08.780 --> 1:33:09.820
 In Europe, it was different.

1:33:09.820 --> 1:33:13.980
 You had your Amigas and Ataris and Acorns in the UK

1:33:13.980 --> 1:33:16.100
 and things that had different things.

1:33:16.100 --> 1:33:17.060
 But in the United States,

1:33:17.060 --> 1:33:19.740
 it was probably the Apple II made the most impact

1:33:19.740 --> 1:33:23.300
 for a lot of programmers of my generation.

1:33:23.300 --> 1:33:26.100
 But so I was really digging into the IBM

1:33:26.100 --> 1:33:29.340
 and this was even more so with the total focus

1:33:29.340 --> 1:33:30.780
 because I had moved to another city

1:33:30.780 --> 1:33:33.860
 where I didn't know anybody that I wasn't working with.

1:33:33.860 --> 1:33:36.380
 I had a little apartment and then at Softdisk,

1:33:36.380 --> 1:33:38.780
 again, the things that drew me to it,

1:33:38.780 --> 1:33:42.260
 I had a couple of programmers that knew more than I did

1:33:42.260 --> 1:33:43.580
 and they had a library.

1:33:43.580 --> 1:33:46.060
 They had a set of books and a set of magazines.

1:33:46.060 --> 1:33:47.700
 They had a couple of years of magazines,

1:33:47.700 --> 1:33:50.700
 the old Dr. Dobbs journal and all of these magazines

1:33:50.700 --> 1:33:53.140
 that had information about things.

1:33:53.140 --> 1:33:56.500
 And so I was just in total immersion mode.

1:33:56.500 --> 1:33:59.460
 It was eat, breathe, sleep, computer programming,

1:33:59.460 --> 1:34:03.300
 particularly the IBM for everything that I was doing.

1:34:03.300 --> 1:34:05.060
 And I was digging into a lot of these

1:34:05.060 --> 1:34:06.580
 low level hardware details

1:34:06.580 --> 1:34:08.900
 that people weren't usually paying attention to,

1:34:08.900 --> 1:34:13.900
 the way the IBM EGA cards worked, which was fun for me.

1:34:13.900 --> 1:34:16.460
 I hadn't had experience with things at that level.

1:34:16.460 --> 1:34:19.580
 And back then you could get hardware documentation

1:34:19.580 --> 1:34:21.020
 just down at the register levels.

1:34:21.020 --> 1:34:23.460
 This is where the CRTC register is.

1:34:23.460 --> 1:34:25.620
 This is how the color registers work

1:34:25.620 --> 1:34:27.420
 and how the different things are applied.

1:34:27.420 --> 1:34:29.820
 And they were designed for a certain reason.

1:34:29.820 --> 1:34:31.420
 They were designed for an application.

1:34:31.420 --> 1:34:33.780
 They had an intended use in mind,

1:34:33.780 --> 1:34:36.820
 but I was starting to look at other ways

1:34:36.820 --> 1:34:38.260
 that they could perhaps be exploited

1:34:38.260 --> 1:34:40.260
 that they weren't initially intended for.

1:34:40.260 --> 1:34:44.020
 Could you comment on like, first of all, what operating system was there?

1:34:44.020 --> 1:34:45.820
 What instruction set was it?

1:34:45.820 --> 1:34:48.580
 Like, what are we talking about?

1:34:48.580 --> 1:34:50.500
 So this was DOS and x86.

1:34:50.500 --> 1:34:52.740
 So 16 bit, 8086.

1:34:52.740 --> 1:34:55.460
 The 286s were there and 386s existed.

1:34:55.460 --> 1:34:56.860
 They were rare.

1:34:56.860 --> 1:34:59.380
 We had a couple for our development systems,

1:34:59.380 --> 1:35:02.740
 but we were still targeting the more broad.

1:35:02.740 --> 1:35:04.940
 It was all DOS 16 bit.

1:35:04.940 --> 1:35:07.540
 None of this was kind of DOS extenders and things.

1:35:07.540 --> 1:35:09.420
 How different is it from the systems of today?

1:35:09.420 --> 1:35:12.340
 Is it kind of a precursor that's similar?

1:35:12.340 --> 1:35:13.020
 Very little.

1:35:13.020 --> 1:35:17.700
 If you open up command.exe or com on Windows,

1:35:17.700 --> 1:35:19.700
 you see some of the remnants of all of that,

1:35:19.700 --> 1:35:21.060
 but it was a different world.

1:35:21.060 --> 1:35:25.620
 It was the 640K is enough world, and nothing was protected.

1:35:25.620 --> 1:35:26.740
 It crashed all the time.

1:35:26.740 --> 1:35:29.940
 You had TSRs or terminate and stay resident hacks

1:35:29.940 --> 1:35:33.180
 on top of things that would cause configuration problems.

1:35:33.180 --> 1:35:37.500
 All the hardware was manually configured in your auto exec.

1:35:37.500 --> 1:35:39.260
 So it was a very different world.

1:35:39.260 --> 1:35:41.300
 But the code is still the same, similar.

1:35:41.300 --> 1:35:42.540
 You could still write it.

1:35:42.540 --> 1:35:44.660
 My earliest code there was written in Pascal.

1:35:44.660 --> 1:35:47.700
 That was what I had learned at an earlier point.

1:35:47.700 --> 1:35:51.180
 So between BASIC and C++, there was Pascal.

1:35:51.180 --> 1:35:55.460
 So when BASIC assembly language, some of my intermediate stuff

1:35:55.460 --> 1:35:57.020
 was, well, you had to for performance.

1:35:57.020 --> 1:35:58.380
 BASIC was just too slow.

1:35:58.380 --> 1:36:00.460
 So most of the work that I was doing

1:36:00.460 --> 1:36:02.820
 as a contract programmer in my teenage years

1:36:02.820 --> 1:36:05.100
 was assembly language.

1:36:05.100 --> 1:36:07.180
 Wait, you wrote games in assembly?

1:36:07.180 --> 1:36:10.660
 Yeah, complete games in assembly language.

1:36:10.660 --> 1:36:12.700
 And it's thousands and thousands of lines

1:36:12.700 --> 1:36:16.580
 of three letter acronyms for the instructions.

1:36:16.580 --> 1:36:21.060
 You don't earn the once again greatest programmer ever label

1:36:21.060 --> 1:36:23.140
 without being able to write a game in assembly.

1:36:23.140 --> 1:36:23.620
 OK.

1:36:23.620 --> 1:36:24.980
 That's good.

1:36:24.980 --> 1:36:27.380
 Everybody serious wrote their games in assembly language.

1:36:27.380 --> 1:36:28.140
 It was kind of a.

1:36:28.140 --> 1:36:28.900
 Everybody serious.

1:36:28.900 --> 1:36:29.700
 See what he said?

1:36:29.700 --> 1:36:31.180
 Everybody serious.

1:36:31.180 --> 1:36:33.940
 It was an outlier to use Pascal a little bit,

1:36:33.940 --> 1:36:36.420
 where there was one famous program called wizardry.

1:36:36.420 --> 1:36:39.460
 It was one of the great early role playing games

1:36:39.460 --> 1:36:40.900
 that was written in Pascal.

1:36:40.900 --> 1:36:43.540
 But it was almost nothing used Pascal there.

1:36:43.540 --> 1:36:45.140
 But I did learn Pascal.

1:36:45.140 --> 1:36:47.220
 And I remember doing all of my.

1:36:47.220 --> 1:36:49.260
 To this day, I sketch in data structures.

1:36:49.260 --> 1:36:52.660
 When I'm thinking about something, I'll open up a file

1:36:52.660 --> 1:36:55.340
 and I'll start writing struct definitions for how

1:36:55.340 --> 1:36:56.900
 data is going to be laid out.

1:36:56.900 --> 1:36:58.940
 And Pascal was kind of formative to that

1:36:58.940 --> 1:37:02.260
 because I remember designing my RPGs in Pascal record

1:37:02.260 --> 1:37:04.100
 structures and things like that.

1:37:04.100 --> 1:37:07.940
 And so I had gotten the Pascal compiler for the Apple 2GS

1:37:07.940 --> 1:37:08.740
 that I could work on.

1:37:08.740 --> 1:37:12.420
 And the first IBM game that I developed, I did in Pascal.

1:37:12.420 --> 1:37:14.860
 And that's actually kind of an interesting story,

1:37:14.860 --> 1:37:17.900
 again, talking about the constraints and resources

1:37:17.900 --> 1:37:19.980
 where I had an Apple 2GS.

1:37:19.980 --> 1:37:21.500
 I didn't have an IBM PC.

1:37:21.500 --> 1:37:24.540
 I wanted to port my applications to IBM

1:37:24.540 --> 1:37:27.060
 because I thought I could make more money on it.

1:37:27.060 --> 1:37:31.540
 So what I wound up doing is I rented a PC for a week

1:37:31.540 --> 1:37:33.940
 and bought a copy of Turbo Pascal.

1:37:33.940 --> 1:37:36.820
 And so I had a hard one week and this was cutting into

1:37:36.820 --> 1:37:38.900
 what minimal profit margin I had there.

1:37:38.900 --> 1:37:40.340
 But I had this computer for a week.

1:37:40.340 --> 1:37:43.300
 I had to get my program ported before I had to return

1:37:43.300 --> 1:37:46.780
 the PC and that was kind of what the first thing

1:37:46.780 --> 1:37:49.220
 that I had done on the IBM PC and what led me

1:37:49.220 --> 1:37:51.620
 to taking the job at Softdisk.

1:37:51.620 --> 1:37:55.260
 And Turbo Pascal, how's that different from regular Pascal?

1:37:55.260 --> 1:37:57.380
 Is it a different compiler or something like that?

1:37:57.380 --> 1:38:00.060
 It was a product of Borland, which before Microsoft

1:38:00.060 --> 1:38:02.980
 kind of killed them, they were the hot stuff

1:38:02.980 --> 1:38:04.180
 developer tools company.

1:38:04.180 --> 1:38:06.540
 You had Borland, Turbo Pascal and Turbo C

1:38:06.540 --> 1:38:09.540
 and Prologue, I mean, all the different things.

1:38:09.540 --> 1:38:12.780
 But what they did was they took a supremely pragmatic

1:38:12.780 --> 1:38:14.500
 approach of making something useful.

1:38:14.500 --> 1:38:17.220
 It was one of these great examples where Pascal

1:38:17.220 --> 1:38:20.340
 was an academic language and you had things like

1:38:20.340 --> 1:38:23.780
 the UCSDP system that Wizardry was actually written in

1:38:23.780 --> 1:38:27.020
 that they did manage to make a game with that,

1:38:27.020 --> 1:38:30.860
 but it was not a super practical system.

1:38:30.860 --> 1:38:33.540
 While Turbo Pascal was, it was called Turbo

1:38:33.540 --> 1:38:35.540
 because it was blazingly fast to compile.

1:38:35.540 --> 1:38:39.460
 I mean, really ridiculously 10 to 20 times faster

1:38:39.460 --> 1:38:41.620
 than most other compilers at the time.

1:38:41.620 --> 1:38:44.360
 But it also had very pragmatic access to look,

1:38:44.360 --> 1:38:46.820
 you can just poke at the hardware in these different ways

1:38:46.820 --> 1:38:49.260
 and we have libraries that let you do things.

1:38:49.260 --> 1:38:51.660
 And it was a pretty good, it was a perfectly good way

1:38:51.660 --> 1:38:53.700
 to write games and this is one of those things

1:38:53.700 --> 1:38:56.500
 where people have talked about different paths

1:38:56.500 --> 1:38:58.660
 that computer development could have taken

1:38:58.660 --> 1:39:01.940
 where C took over the world for reasons

1:39:01.940 --> 1:39:05.100
 that came out of Unix and eventually Linux.

1:39:05.100 --> 1:39:07.260
 And that was not a foregone conclusion at all.

1:39:07.260 --> 1:39:10.860
 And people can make real reasoned rational arguments

1:39:10.860 --> 1:39:12.440
 that the world might've been better

1:39:12.440 --> 1:39:14.420
 if it had gone a Pascal route.

1:39:14.420 --> 1:39:17.660
 I'm somewhat agnostic on that where I do know

1:39:17.660 --> 1:39:21.260
 from experience, it was perfectly good enough to do that.

1:39:21.260 --> 1:39:23.180
 And it had some fundamental improvements

1:39:23.180 --> 1:39:26.100
 like it had range checked arrays as an option there,

1:39:26.100 --> 1:39:29.620
 which could avoid many of C's real hazards

1:39:29.620 --> 1:39:31.560
 that happened in a security space.

1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:33.740
 But C1, they were basically offering it

1:39:33.740 --> 1:39:35.580
 about the same level of abstraction.

1:39:35.580 --> 1:39:38.660
 It was a systems programming language, but.

1:39:38.660 --> 1:39:41.380
 But you said Pascal had a more emphasis on data structures.

1:39:41.380 --> 1:39:44.980
 I actually, in the tree of languages,

1:39:44.980 --> 1:39:48.100
 did Pascal come before C?

1:39:48.100 --> 1:39:49.660
 They were pretty contemporaneous.

1:39:49.660 --> 1:39:53.380
 So Pascal's lineage went to Modula 2 and eventually Oberon,

1:39:53.380 --> 1:39:58.740
 which was another Nicholas word, kind of experimental language.

1:39:58.740 --> 1:40:01.420
 But they were all good enough at that level.

1:40:01.420 --> 1:40:04.340
 Now, some of the classic academic oriented Pascals

1:40:04.340 --> 1:40:06.380
 were just missing fundamental things like, oh, you can't

1:40:06.380 --> 1:40:08.620
 access this core system thing because we're just

1:40:08.620 --> 1:40:10.340
 using it to teach students.

1:40:10.340 --> 1:40:14.060
 But Turbo Pascal showed that only modest changes to it

1:40:14.060 --> 1:40:17.140
 really did make it a completely capable language.

1:40:17.140 --> 1:40:19.620
 And it had some reasons why you could implement it

1:40:19.620 --> 1:40:22.580
 as a single pass compiler so it could be way, way faster,

1:40:22.580 --> 1:40:24.460
 although less scope for optimizations

1:40:24.460 --> 1:40:26.260
 if you do it that way.

1:40:26.260 --> 1:40:28.300
 And it did have some range checking options.

1:40:28.300 --> 1:40:30.740
 It had a little bit better typing capability.

1:40:30.740 --> 1:40:33.140
 You'd have properly typed enums, sorts of things,

1:40:33.140 --> 1:40:35.220
 and other stuff that C lacked.

1:40:35.220 --> 1:40:37.900
 But C was also clearly good enough.

1:40:37.900 --> 1:40:39.660
 And it wound up with a huge inertia

1:40:39.660 --> 1:40:42.740
 from the Unix ecosystem and everything that came with that.

1:40:42.740 --> 1:40:43.980
 Garbage collection?

1:40:43.980 --> 1:40:45.380
 No, it was not garbage collected.

1:40:45.380 --> 1:40:46.500
 It's just the same kind of thing as C.

1:40:46.500 --> 1:40:47.100
 Same manual.

1:40:47.100 --> 1:40:49.100
 So you could still have your use after freeze

1:40:49.100 --> 1:40:50.320
 and all those other problems.

1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:53.740
 But just getting rid of array overruns,

1:40:53.740 --> 1:40:56.080
 at least if you were compiled with that debugging option,

1:40:56.080 --> 1:40:58.260
 certainly would have avoided a lot of problems

1:40:58.260 --> 1:40:59.740
 and could have a lot of benefits.

1:40:59.740 --> 1:41:01.400
 But so anyways, that was the next thing.

1:41:01.400 --> 1:41:04.780
 I had to learn C because C was where it seemed like most

1:41:04.780 --> 1:41:07.020
 of the things were going.

1:41:07.020 --> 1:41:09.580
 So I abandoned Pascal and I started working in C.

1:41:09.580 --> 1:41:11.980
 I started hacking on these hardware things dealing

1:41:11.980 --> 1:41:16.000
 with the graphics controllers and the EGA systems.

1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:19.060
 And what we most wanted to do, so at that time

1:41:19.060 --> 1:41:22.260
 we were sitting in our darkened office

1:41:22.260 --> 1:41:24.740
 playing all the different console video games.

1:41:24.740 --> 1:41:27.620
 And we were figuring out what games

1:41:27.620 --> 1:41:30.500
 do we want to make for our Gamer's Edge product there.

1:41:30.500 --> 1:41:34.180
 And so we had one of the first Super Nintendos sitting there.

1:41:34.180 --> 1:41:37.500
 And we had an older Nintendo looking at all those games.

1:41:37.500 --> 1:41:40.020
 And the core thing that those consoles did that you just

1:41:40.020 --> 1:41:42.700
 didn't get on the PC games was this ability

1:41:42.700 --> 1:41:45.180
 to have a massive scrolling world where

1:41:45.180 --> 1:41:47.980
 most of the games that you would make on the PC

1:41:47.980 --> 1:41:51.500
 and earlier personal computers would be a static screen.

1:41:51.500 --> 1:41:55.020
 You move little things around on it and you interact like that.

1:41:55.020 --> 1:41:58.260
 Maybe you go to additional screens as you move.

1:41:58.260 --> 1:42:01.900
 But arcade games and consoles had this wonderful ability

1:42:01.900 --> 1:42:04.420
 to just have a big world that you're slowly

1:42:04.420 --> 1:42:06.100
 moving your window through.

1:42:06.100 --> 1:42:08.460
 And that was for those types of games,

1:42:08.460 --> 1:42:10.820
 that kind of action exploration adventure games,

1:42:10.820 --> 1:42:13.060
 that was a super, super important thing.

1:42:13.060 --> 1:42:16.260
 And PC games just didn't do that.

1:42:16.260 --> 1:42:18.740
 And what I had come across was a couple

1:42:18.740 --> 1:42:22.300
 of different techniques for implementing that on the PC.

1:42:22.300 --> 1:42:25.180
 And they're not hard, complicated things.

1:42:25.180 --> 1:42:28.140
 When I explain them now, they're pretty straightforward.

1:42:28.140 --> 1:42:29.260
 But just nobody was doing it.

1:42:29.260 --> 1:42:31.900
 You sound like Einstein describing his five papers

1:42:31.900 --> 1:42:33.100
 is pretty straightforward.

1:42:33.100 --> 1:42:34.020
 I understand.

1:42:34.020 --> 1:42:35.980
 But they're nevertheless revolutionary.

1:42:35.980 --> 1:42:38.420
 So side scrolling is a game changer.

1:42:38.420 --> 1:42:40.420
 Yeah, and scrolling is a genius invention.

1:42:40.420 --> 1:42:41.620
 It's either vertical.

1:42:41.620 --> 1:42:43.660
 And some of the consoles had different limitations

1:42:43.660 --> 1:42:45.420
 about you could do one but not the other.

1:42:45.420 --> 1:42:48.420
 And there were similar things going on as advancements,

1:42:48.420 --> 1:42:51.740
 even in the console space, where you'd have the original Mario

1:42:51.740 --> 1:42:54.580
 game was just horizontal scrolling.

1:42:54.580 --> 1:42:57.300
 And then later, Mario games added vertical aspects to it

1:42:57.300 --> 1:42:59.180
 and different things that you were

1:42:59.180 --> 1:43:02.980
 doing to explore, kind of expand the capabilities there.

1:43:02.980 --> 1:43:05.500
 And so much of the early game design for decades

1:43:05.500 --> 1:43:08.580
 was removing limitations, letting you do things

1:43:08.580 --> 1:43:10.100
 that you envisioned as a designer,

1:43:10.100 --> 1:43:11.940
 you wanted the player to experience,

1:43:11.940 --> 1:43:14.340
 but the hardware just couldn't really

1:43:14.340 --> 1:43:16.580
 or you didn't know how to make it happen.

1:43:16.580 --> 1:43:17.700
 It felt impossible.

1:43:17.700 --> 1:43:21.940
 You can imagine that you want to create like this big world

1:43:21.940 --> 1:43:23.940
 through which you can side scroll,

1:43:23.940 --> 1:43:26.660
 like through which you can walk.

1:43:26.660 --> 1:43:28.380
 And then you ask yourself a question,

1:43:28.380 --> 1:43:31.900
 how do I actually build that in a way that's

1:43:31.900 --> 1:43:35.900
 like the latency is low enough, the hardware can actually

1:43:35.900 --> 1:43:38.780
 deliver that in such a way that it's a compelling experience.

1:43:38.780 --> 1:43:40.380
 Yeah, and we knew what we wanted to do

1:43:40.380 --> 1:43:42.700
 because we were playing all of these console games,

1:43:42.700 --> 1:43:45.140
 playing all these Nintendo games and arcade games.

1:43:45.140 --> 1:43:47.260
 Clearly, there was a whole world of awesome things

1:43:47.260 --> 1:43:51.380
 there that we just couldn't do on the PC, at least initially.

1:43:51.380 --> 1:43:52.860
 Because every programmer can tell,

1:43:52.860 --> 1:43:54.220
 it's like if you want to scroll, you can just

1:43:54.220 --> 1:43:55.460
 redraw the whole screen.

1:43:55.460 --> 1:43:56.860
 But then it turns out, well, you're

1:43:56.860 --> 1:43:58.820
 going five frames per second.

1:43:58.820 --> 1:44:01.020
 That's not an interactive fun experience.

1:44:01.020 --> 1:44:04.700
 You want to be going 30 or 60 frames per second or something.

1:44:04.700 --> 1:44:06.860
 And it just didn't feel like that was possible.

1:44:06.860 --> 1:44:10.500
 It felt like the PCs had to get five times faster for you

1:44:10.500 --> 1:44:12.700
 to make a playable game there.

1:44:12.700 --> 1:44:16.140
 And interestingly, I wound up with two completely different

1:44:16.140 --> 1:44:18.820
 solutions for the scrolling problem.

1:44:18.820 --> 1:44:23.060
 And this is a theme that runs through everything, where

1:44:23.060 --> 1:44:25.740
 all of these big technical advancements, it turns out

1:44:25.740 --> 1:44:28.460
 there's always a couple different ways of doing them.

1:44:28.460 --> 1:44:31.740
 And it's not like you found the one true way of doing it.

1:44:31.740 --> 1:44:35.220
 And we'll see this as we go into 3D games and things later.

1:44:35.220 --> 1:44:38.540
 But so the scrolling, the first set of scrolling tricks

1:44:38.540 --> 1:44:43.620
 that I got was the hardware had this ability to,

1:44:43.620 --> 1:44:47.660
 you could shift inside the window of memory.

1:44:47.660 --> 1:44:51.980
 So the EGA cards at the time had 256 kilobytes of memory.

1:44:51.980 --> 1:44:55.340
 And it was awkwardly set up in this planar format,

1:44:55.340 --> 1:45:00.780
 where instead of having 256 or 24 million colors,

1:45:00.780 --> 1:45:03.420
 you had 16 colors, which is four bits.

1:45:03.420 --> 1:45:06.300
 So you had four bit planes, 64k a piece.

1:45:06.300 --> 1:45:08.420
 Of course, 64k is a nice round number

1:45:08.420 --> 1:45:10.380
 for 16 bit addressing.

1:45:10.380 --> 1:45:13.860
 So your graphics card had a 16 bit window

1:45:13.860 --> 1:45:15.220
 that you could look at.

1:45:15.220 --> 1:45:17.900
 And you could tell it to start the video scan out

1:45:17.900 --> 1:45:19.340
 anywhere inside there.

1:45:19.340 --> 1:45:21.140
 So there were a couple games that

1:45:21.140 --> 1:45:23.900
 had taken this approach of you could make a 2 by 2 screen

1:45:23.900 --> 1:45:25.740
 or a 1 by 4 screen.

1:45:25.740 --> 1:45:28.140
 And you could do scrolling really easily like that.

1:45:28.140 --> 1:45:30.940
 You could just lay it all out and just pan around there.

1:45:30.940 --> 1:45:32.620
 But you just couldn't make it any bigger

1:45:32.620 --> 1:45:35.540
 because that's all the memory that was there.

1:45:35.540 --> 1:45:37.700
 The first insight to the scrolling that I had

1:45:37.700 --> 1:45:42.300
 was, well, if we make a screen that's just one tile larger,

1:45:42.300 --> 1:45:45.820
 and we usually had tiles that were 16 pixels by 16 pixels,

1:45:45.820 --> 1:45:48.940
 the little classic Mario block that you run into,

1:45:48.940 --> 1:45:50.820
 lots of art gets drawn that way.

1:45:50.820 --> 1:45:52.860
 And your screen is a certain number of tiles.

1:45:52.860 --> 1:45:56.620
 But if you had one little buffer region outside of that,

1:45:56.620 --> 1:45:59.980
 you could easily pan around inside that 16 pixel region.

1:45:59.980 --> 1:46:01.740
 That could be perfectly smooth.

1:46:01.740 --> 1:46:04.020
 But then what happens if you get to the edge

1:46:04.020 --> 1:46:05.940
 and you want to keep going?

1:46:05.940 --> 1:46:08.380
 The first way we did scrolling was

1:46:08.380 --> 1:46:11.460
 what I called adaptive tile refresh, which was really

1:46:11.460 --> 1:46:13.620
 just a matter of you get to the edge

1:46:13.620 --> 1:46:16.140
 and then you go back to the original point

1:46:16.140 --> 1:46:19.380
 and then only change the tiles that have actually

1:46:19.380 --> 1:46:21.580
 that are different between where it was.

1:46:21.580 --> 1:46:23.380
 In most of the games at the time,

1:46:23.380 --> 1:46:26.900
 if you think about your classic Super Mario Brothers game,

1:46:26.900 --> 1:46:30.940
 you've got big fields of blue sky, long rows

1:46:30.940 --> 1:46:33.300
 of the same brick texture.

1:46:33.300 --> 1:46:34.980
 And there's a lot of commonality.

1:46:34.980 --> 1:46:36.580
 It's like a data compression thing.

1:46:36.580 --> 1:46:38.980
 If you take the screen and you set it down

1:46:38.980 --> 1:46:42.460
 on top of each other, in general, only about 10%

1:46:42.460 --> 1:46:45.180
 of the tiles were actually different there.

1:46:45.180 --> 1:46:47.940
 So this was a way to go ahead and say,

1:46:47.940 --> 1:46:49.980
 well, I'm going to move it back, and then I'm only

1:46:49.980 --> 1:46:54.100
 going to change those 10%, 20%, whatever percent tiles there.

1:46:54.100 --> 1:46:57.540
 And that meant that it was essentially five times faster

1:46:57.540 --> 1:46:59.860
 than if you were redrawing all of the tiles.

1:46:59.860 --> 1:47:01.300
 And that worked well enough for us

1:47:01.300 --> 1:47:04.860
 to do a bunch of these games for Gamer's Edge.

1:47:04.860 --> 1:47:07.100
 We had a lot of these scrolling games like Slurred Axe

1:47:07.100 --> 1:47:09.260
 and Shadow Knights and things like that

1:47:09.260 --> 1:47:11.380
 that we were cranking out at this high rate that

1:47:11.380 --> 1:47:13.540
 had this scrolling effect on it.

1:47:13.540 --> 1:47:14.620
 And it worked well enough.

1:47:14.620 --> 1:47:16.100
 There were design challenges there

1:47:16.100 --> 1:47:18.180
 where if you made the worst case,

1:47:18.180 --> 1:47:20.460
 if you made a checkerboard over the entire screen,

1:47:20.460 --> 1:47:23.220
 you scroll over one and every single tile changes

1:47:23.220 --> 1:47:25.100
 and your frame rate's now five frames per second

1:47:25.100 --> 1:47:27.100
 because it had to redraw everything.

1:47:27.100 --> 1:47:28.700
 So the designers had a little bit

1:47:28.700 --> 1:47:29.900
 that they had to worry about.

1:47:29.900 --> 1:47:32.020
 They had to make these relatively plain looking

1:47:32.020 --> 1:47:34.900
 levels, but it was still pretty magical.

1:47:34.900 --> 1:47:37.460
 It was something that we hadn't seen before.

1:47:37.460 --> 1:47:41.340
 And the first thing that we wound up doing with that

1:47:41.340 --> 1:47:43.660
 was I had just gotten this working,

1:47:43.660 --> 1:47:46.300
 and Tom Hall was sitting there with me,

1:47:46.300 --> 1:47:49.820
 and we were looking over at our Super Nintendo on the side

1:47:49.820 --> 1:47:52.500
 there with Super Mario 3 running.

1:47:52.500 --> 1:47:56.260
 And we had the technology, we had the tools set up there,

1:47:56.260 --> 1:47:57.780
 and we stayed up all night.

1:47:57.780 --> 1:47:59.820
 And we basically cloned the first level

1:47:59.820 --> 1:48:01.260
 of Super Mario Brothers.

1:48:01.260 --> 1:48:02.460
 Performance wise as well?

1:48:02.460 --> 1:48:02.940
 Yeah.

1:48:02.940 --> 1:48:05.860
 And we had our little character running and jumping in there.

1:48:05.860 --> 1:48:09.100
 It was close to pixel accurate as far

1:48:09.100 --> 1:48:11.300
 as all the backgrounds and everything,

1:48:11.300 --> 1:48:13.540
 but the gaming was just stuff that we cobbled together

1:48:13.540 --> 1:48:15.380
 from previous games that I had written.

1:48:15.380 --> 1:48:18.060
 I just really kitbashed the whole thing together

1:48:18.060 --> 1:48:19.420
 to make this demo.

1:48:19.420 --> 1:48:21.500
 And that was one of the rare cases

1:48:21.500 --> 1:48:24.260
 when I said I don't usually do these all night programming

1:48:24.260 --> 1:48:24.860
 things.

1:48:24.860 --> 1:48:26.860
 There's probably only two memorable ones

1:48:26.860 --> 1:48:28.580
 that I can think about.

1:48:28.580 --> 1:48:31.940
 One was the all nighter to go ahead and get

1:48:31.940 --> 1:48:34.460
 our Dangerous Dave and copyright infringement

1:48:34.460 --> 1:48:35.420
 is how we titled it.

1:48:35.420 --> 1:48:38.100
 Because we had a game called Dangerous Dave running around

1:48:38.100 --> 1:48:41.140
 with a shotgun shooting things, and we were just

1:48:41.140 --> 1:48:44.140
 taking our most beloved game at the time there, the Super Mario

1:48:44.140 --> 1:48:47.980
 3, and sticking Dave inside that with this new scrolling

1:48:47.980 --> 1:48:53.500
 technology that was going perfectly smooth for them

1:48:53.500 --> 1:48:54.660
 as it ran.

1:48:54.660 --> 1:48:58.340
 And Tom and I just blearily the next morning left,

1:48:58.340 --> 1:49:02.940
 and we left a disk on the desk for John Romero and Jay

1:49:02.940 --> 1:49:05.220
 Wilbur to see and just said, run this.

1:49:05.220 --> 1:49:08.380
 And we eventually made it back in later in the day,

1:49:08.380 --> 1:49:13.260
 and it was like they grabbed us and pulled us into the room.

1:49:13.260 --> 1:49:15.660
 And that was the point where they were like,

1:49:15.660 --> 1:49:17.740
 we got to do something with this.

1:49:17.740 --> 1:49:19.300
 We're going to make a company.

1:49:19.300 --> 1:49:21.580
 We're going to go make our own games, where

1:49:21.580 --> 1:49:24.980
 this was something that we were able to just kind of hit them

1:49:24.980 --> 1:49:27.060
 with a hammer of an experience like, wow, this

1:49:27.060 --> 1:49:30.140
 is just like so much cooler than what we thought

1:49:30.140 --> 1:49:31.660
 was possible there.

1:49:31.660 --> 1:49:33.860
 And initially, we tried to get Nintendo

1:49:33.860 --> 1:49:36.900
 to let us make Super Mario 3 on the PC.

1:49:36.900 --> 1:49:38.420
 That's really what we wanted to do.

1:49:38.420 --> 1:49:40.220
 We were like, hey, we can finish this.

1:49:40.220 --> 1:49:41.380
 It's line of sight.

1:49:41.380 --> 1:49:42.620
 This will be great.

1:49:42.620 --> 1:49:45.180
 And we sent something to Nintendo,

1:49:45.180 --> 1:49:48.180
 and we heard that it did get looked at in Japan,

1:49:48.180 --> 1:49:50.380
 and they just weren't interested in that.

1:49:50.380 --> 1:49:52.180
 But that's another one of those life could

1:49:52.180 --> 1:49:53.740
 have gone a very different way, where

1:49:53.740 --> 1:49:57.700
 we could have been like Nintendo's house PC team

1:49:57.700 --> 1:49:58.540
 at that point.

1:49:58.540 --> 1:50:06.660
 And define the direction of Wolfenstein and Doom and Quake

1:50:06.660 --> 1:50:08.940
 could have been a Nintendo creation.

1:50:08.940 --> 1:50:09.460
 Yeah.

1:50:09.460 --> 1:50:11.620
 So at the same time that we were just

1:50:11.620 --> 1:50:14.660
 doing our first scrolling demos, we

1:50:14.660 --> 1:50:17.660
 reached out to Scott Miller at Apogee and said,

1:50:17.660 --> 1:50:20.180
 it's like, hey, we do want to make some games.

1:50:20.180 --> 1:50:22.660
 These things that you think you want, those are nothing.

1:50:22.660 --> 1:50:24.540
 What do you see what we can actually do now?

1:50:24.540 --> 1:50:26.180
 This is going to be amazing.

1:50:26.180 --> 1:50:29.340
 And he just popped right up and sent a check to us,

1:50:29.340 --> 1:50:31.420
 where at that point, we still thought

1:50:31.420 --> 1:50:34.500
 he might be a fraud, that he was just lying about all of this.

1:50:34.500 --> 1:50:36.900
 But he was totally correct on how much money

1:50:36.900 --> 1:50:39.340
 he was making with his shareware titles.

1:50:39.340 --> 1:50:43.180
 And this was his real brainstorm about this,

1:50:43.180 --> 1:50:45.980
 where shareware was this idea that software

1:50:45.980 --> 1:50:47.220
 doesn't have a fixed price.

1:50:47.220 --> 1:50:49.860
 If you use it, you send out of the goodness of your heart

1:50:49.860 --> 1:50:51.660
 some money to the creator.

1:50:51.660 --> 1:50:53.300
 And there were a couple of utilities

1:50:53.300 --> 1:50:55.980
 that did make some significant success like that.

1:50:55.980 --> 1:50:58.420
 But for the most part, it didn't really work.

1:50:58.420 --> 1:51:01.580
 Now, there wasn't much software in a pure shareware model

1:51:01.580 --> 1:51:03.860
 that was successful.

1:51:03.860 --> 1:51:07.700
 The Apogee innovation was to take something,

1:51:07.700 --> 1:51:10.180
 call it shareware, split it into three pieces.

1:51:10.180 --> 1:51:12.100
 You always made a trilogy.

1:51:12.100 --> 1:51:14.300
 And you would put the first piece out,

1:51:14.300 --> 1:51:16.180
 but then you buy the whole trilogy

1:51:16.180 --> 1:51:19.420
 for some shareware amount, which in reality,

1:51:19.420 --> 1:51:21.260
 it meant that the first part was a demo,

1:51:21.260 --> 1:51:24.060
 where you kind of like the demo went everywhere for free

1:51:24.060 --> 1:51:26.580
 and you paid money to get the whole set.

1:51:26.580 --> 1:51:28.620
 But it was still play to shareware.

1:51:28.620 --> 1:51:31.060
 And we were happy to have the first one go everywhere.

1:51:31.060 --> 1:51:33.980
 And it wasn't a crippled demo, where the first episode

1:51:33.980 --> 1:51:36.420
 of all these trilogies, it was a real complete game.

1:51:36.420 --> 1:51:39.820
 And probably 20 times as many people played that part of it,

1:51:39.820 --> 1:51:43.500
 thought they had a great game, had fond memories of it,

1:51:43.500 --> 1:51:45.340
 but never paid us a dime.

1:51:45.340 --> 1:51:48.140
 But enough people were happy with that,

1:51:48.140 --> 1:51:50.700
 where it was really quite successful.

1:51:50.700 --> 1:51:53.220
 And these early games that we didn't think very much of

1:51:53.220 --> 1:51:55.780
 compared to commercial quality games,

1:51:55.780 --> 1:51:57.780
 but they were doing really good business,

1:51:57.780 --> 1:51:59.320
 some fairly crude things.

1:51:59.320 --> 1:52:01.340
 And people, it was good business.

1:52:01.340 --> 1:52:02.340
 People enjoyed it.

1:52:02.340 --> 1:52:04.500
 And it wasn't like you were taking a crapshoot

1:52:04.500 --> 1:52:05.540
 on what you were getting.

1:52:05.540 --> 1:52:07.780
 You just played a third of the experience.

1:52:07.780 --> 1:52:10.860
 And you loved it enough to hand write out a check

1:52:10.860 --> 1:52:13.860
 and put it in an envelope and address it and send it out

1:52:13.860 --> 1:52:16.740
 to Apogee to get the rest of them.

1:52:16.740 --> 1:52:20.620
 So it was a really pretty feel good business prospect there,

1:52:20.620 --> 1:52:23.160
 because everybody was happy.

1:52:23.160 --> 1:52:26.060
 They knew what they were getting when they sent it in.

1:52:26.060 --> 1:52:27.180
 They would send in fan mail.

1:52:27.180 --> 1:52:29.520
 If you're going to the trouble of addressing a letter

1:52:29.520 --> 1:52:32.660
 and filling out an envelope, you write something in it.

1:52:32.660 --> 1:52:35.420
 And there were just the literal bags of fan mail

1:52:35.420 --> 1:52:38.940
 for the shareware games, so people loved them.

1:52:38.940 --> 1:52:42.540
 I should mention that for you, the definition of wealth

1:52:42.540 --> 1:52:46.580
 is being able to have pizza whenever you want.

1:52:46.580 --> 1:52:50.780
 For me, there was a dream that I would play shareware games

1:52:50.780 --> 1:52:53.860
 over and over, the part that's free, over and over.

1:52:53.860 --> 1:52:56.500
 And it was very deeply fulfilling experience.

1:52:56.500 --> 1:53:00.340
 But I dreamed of a time when I could actually

1:53:00.340 --> 1:53:02.160
 afford the full experience.

1:53:02.160 --> 1:53:05.920
 And this is kind of this dreamland beyond the horizon

1:53:05.920 --> 1:53:09.380
 when you could find out what else is there.

1:53:09.380 --> 1:53:14.380
 In some sense, even just playing the shareware was,

1:53:14.380 --> 1:53:17.980
 it's the limitation of that.

1:53:17.980 --> 1:53:21.540
 You know, life is limited, eventually we all die.

1:53:21.540 --> 1:53:26.540
 In that way, shareware was somehow really fulfilling

1:53:26.820 --> 1:53:31.580
 to have this kind of mysterious thing beyond what's free

1:53:31.580 --> 1:53:32.420
 always there.

1:53:32.420 --> 1:53:35.420
 It's kind of, I don't know, maybe it's because

1:53:35.420 --> 1:53:37.580
 a part of my childhood is playing shareware games.

1:53:37.580 --> 1:53:39.520
 That was a really fulfilling experience.

1:53:39.520 --> 1:53:43.100
 It's so interesting how that model still brought joy

1:53:43.100 --> 1:53:44.020
 to so many people.

1:53:44.020 --> 1:53:45.980
 The 20X people that played it.

1:53:45.980 --> 1:53:47.340
 I felt very good about that.

1:53:47.340 --> 1:53:49.700
 I would run into people that would say,

1:53:49.700 --> 1:53:52.220
 oh, I loved that game that you had early on,

1:53:52.220 --> 1:53:53.500
 Commander Keen, whatever.

1:53:53.500 --> 1:53:57.500
 And no, they meant just the first episode

1:53:57.500 --> 1:53:58.740
 that they got to see everywhere.

1:53:58.740 --> 1:54:01.020
 That's me, I played the crap out of Commander Keen.

1:54:01.020 --> 1:54:03.300
 And that was all good.

1:54:03.300 --> 1:54:04.140
 Yeah, yeah.

1:54:04.140 --> 1:54:06.780
 But so we were in this position where Scott Miller

1:54:06.780 --> 1:54:10.420
 was just fronting us cash, saying, yeah, make a game.

1:54:10.420 --> 1:54:14.140
 But we did not properly pull the trigger and say,

1:54:14.140 --> 1:54:16.380
 all right, we're quitting our jobs.

1:54:16.380 --> 1:54:17.940
 We were like, we're gonna do both.

1:54:17.940 --> 1:54:21.280
 We're gonna keep working at Softdisk, working on this.

1:54:21.280 --> 1:54:24.740
 And then we're going to go ahead and make a new game

1:54:24.740 --> 1:54:27.060
 for Apogee at the same time.

1:54:27.060 --> 1:54:29.580
 And this eventually did lead to some legal problems.

1:54:29.580 --> 1:54:31.100
 And we had trouble.

1:54:31.100 --> 1:54:32.820
 It all got worked out in the end,

1:54:32.820 --> 1:54:35.860
 but it was not a good call at the time there.

1:54:35.860 --> 1:54:39.380
 And your legal mind at the time was not stellar.

1:54:39.380 --> 1:54:42.340
 You were not thinking in terms of the illegal terms.

1:54:42.340 --> 1:54:44.020
 No, I definitely wasn't.

1:54:44.020 --> 1:54:45.240
 None of us were.

1:54:46.140 --> 1:54:47.620
 And in hindsight, yeah, it's like,

1:54:47.620 --> 1:54:48.940
 how did we think we were gonna get away

1:54:48.940 --> 1:54:51.180
 with even using our work computers

1:54:51.180 --> 1:54:56.180
 to write software for our breakaway new company?

1:54:56.820 --> 1:54:58.420
 It was not a good plan.

1:54:58.420 --> 1:55:00.980
 How did Commander Keen come to be?

1:55:00.980 --> 1:55:04.100
 So the design process, we would start from,

1:55:04.100 --> 1:55:05.900
 we had some idea of what we wanted to do.

1:55:05.900 --> 1:55:08.340
 We wanted to do a Mario like game.

1:55:08.340 --> 1:55:10.180
 It was gonna be a side scroller.

1:55:10.180 --> 1:55:11.800
 It was gonna use the technology.

1:55:11.800 --> 1:55:14.340
 We had some sense of what it would have to look like

1:55:14.340 --> 1:55:15.500
 because of the limitations

1:55:15.500 --> 1:55:17.980
 of this adaptive tile refresh technology.

1:55:17.980 --> 1:55:21.220
 It had to have fields of relatively constant tiles.

1:55:21.220 --> 1:55:23.500
 You couldn't just paint up a background

1:55:23.500 --> 1:55:25.000
 and then move that around.

1:55:25.940 --> 1:55:28.620
 The early design or all the design for Commander Keen

1:55:28.620 --> 1:55:30.020
 really came from Tom Hall,

1:55:30.020 --> 1:55:34.900
 where he was kind of the main creative mind

1:55:34.900 --> 1:55:36.940
 for the early id software stuff,

1:55:36.940 --> 1:55:39.080
 where we had an interesting division of things

1:55:39.080 --> 1:55:42.220
 where Tom was all creative and design.

1:55:42.220 --> 1:55:43.620
 I was all programming.

1:55:43.620 --> 1:55:45.540
 John Romero was an interesting bridge

1:55:45.540 --> 1:55:47.740
 where he was both a very good programmer

1:55:47.740 --> 1:55:50.140
 and also a very good designer and artist

1:55:50.140 --> 1:55:52.500
 and kind of straddled between the areas.

1:55:52.500 --> 1:55:55.540
 But Commander Keen was very much Tom Hall's baby.

1:55:55.540 --> 1:55:59.300
 And he came up with all the design and backstory

1:55:59.300 --> 1:56:02.340
 for the different things of kind of a mad scientist,

1:56:02.340 --> 1:56:06.460
 little kid with building a rocket ship

1:56:06.460 --> 1:56:09.100
 and a zap gun and visiting alien worlds

1:56:09.100 --> 1:56:11.540
 and doing all of this that the background

1:56:11.540 --> 1:56:13.620
 that we lay the game inside of.

1:56:13.620 --> 1:56:16.780
 And there's not a whole lot to any of these things.

1:56:16.780 --> 1:56:19.540
 Design for us was always just what we needed to do

1:56:19.540 --> 1:56:23.060
 to make the game that was gonna be so much fun to play.

1:56:23.060 --> 1:56:26.820
 And we laid out our first trilogy of games,

1:56:26.820 --> 1:56:29.460
 the shareware formula, it's gonna be three pieces.

1:56:29.460 --> 1:56:31.780
 We make Commander Keen one, two, and three.

1:56:31.780 --> 1:56:35.820
 And we just really started busting on all that work.

1:56:35.820 --> 1:56:37.700
 And it went together really quickly.

1:56:37.700 --> 1:56:39.580
 It was like three months or something

1:56:39.580 --> 1:56:41.940
 that while we were still making games every month

1:56:41.940 --> 1:56:45.500
 for Gamer's Edge, we were sharing technology between that.

1:56:45.500 --> 1:56:46.820
 I'd write a bunch of code for this

1:56:46.820 --> 1:56:48.980
 and we'd just kind of use it for both.

1:56:48.980 --> 1:56:50.900
 Again, not a particularly good idea there

1:56:50.900 --> 1:56:53.020
 that had consequences for us.

1:56:53.020 --> 1:56:57.220
 But in three months, we got our first game out

1:56:57.220 --> 1:57:00.660
 and all of a sudden it was three times as successful

1:57:00.660 --> 1:57:03.060
 as the most successful thing Apogee had had before.

1:57:03.060 --> 1:57:05.780
 And we were making like $30,000 a month

1:57:05.780 --> 1:57:09.060
 immediately from the Commander Keen stuff.

1:57:09.060 --> 1:57:11.700
 And that was again, a surprise to us.

1:57:11.700 --> 1:57:15.300
 It was more than we thought that that was gonna make.

1:57:15.300 --> 1:57:17.340
 And we said, well, we're gonna certainly roll

1:57:17.340 --> 1:57:19.980
 into another set of titles from this.

1:57:19.980 --> 1:57:21.800
 And in that three months, I had come up

1:57:21.800 --> 1:57:24.860
 with a much better way of doing the scrolling technology

1:57:24.860 --> 1:57:27.220
 that was not the adaptive tile refresh,

1:57:27.220 --> 1:57:29.200
 which in some ways was even simpler.

1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:33.440
 And these things, so many of the great ideas of technology

1:57:33.440 --> 1:57:36.300
 are things that are back of the envelope designs.

1:57:36.300 --> 1:57:38.400
 I make this comment about modern machine learning

1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:40.780
 where all the things that are really important

1:57:40.780 --> 1:57:42.740
 practically in the last decade are,

1:57:42.740 --> 1:57:44.460
 each of them fits on the back of an envelope.

1:57:44.460 --> 1:57:46.340
 There are these simple little things.

1:57:46.340 --> 1:57:51.340
 They're not super dense, hard to understand technologies.

1:57:51.340 --> 1:57:55.060
 And so the second scrolling trick was just a matter of like,

1:57:55.060 --> 1:57:58.560
 okay, we know we've got this 64K window.

1:57:58.560 --> 1:58:00.040
 And the question was always like,

1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:02.260
 well, you could make a two by two,

1:58:02.260 --> 1:58:05.500
 but you can't go off the edge.

1:58:05.500 --> 1:58:07.800
 But I finally asked, well, what actually happens

1:58:07.800 --> 1:58:09.600
 if you just go off the edge?

1:58:09.600 --> 1:58:12.260
 If you take your start and you say, it's like,

1:58:12.260 --> 1:58:14.460
 okay, I can move over, I'm scrolling,

1:58:14.460 --> 1:58:16.920
 I can move over, I can move down, I'm scrolling.

1:58:16.920 --> 1:58:19.780
 I get to what should be the bottom of the memory window.

1:58:19.780 --> 1:58:21.620
 It's like, well, what if I just keep going?

1:58:21.620 --> 1:58:24.020
 And I say, I'm gonna start at,

1:58:24.020 --> 1:58:26.380
 what happens if I start at FFFE

1:58:26.380 --> 1:58:29.420
 at the very end of the 64K block?

1:58:29.420 --> 1:58:32.420
 And it turns out it just wraps back around to the top

1:58:32.420 --> 1:58:33.300
 of the block.

1:58:33.300 --> 1:58:35.860
 And I'm like, oh, well, this makes everything easy.

1:58:35.860 --> 1:58:37.620
 You can just scroll the screen everywhere

1:58:37.620 --> 1:58:40.420
 and all you have to draw is just one new line of tiles,

1:58:40.420 --> 1:58:42.100
 which everything you expose,

1:58:42.100 --> 1:58:44.660
 it might be unaligned off various parts

1:58:44.660 --> 1:58:48.180
 of the screen memory, but it just works.

1:58:48.180 --> 1:58:50.820
 That no longer had the problem of you had to have fields

1:58:50.820 --> 1:58:53.720
 of the similar colors because it doesn't matter

1:58:53.720 --> 1:58:54.980
 what you're doing, you could be having

1:58:54.980 --> 1:58:57.780
 a completely unique world and you're just drawing

1:58:57.780 --> 1:58:59.460
 the new strip as it comes on.

1:58:59.460 --> 1:59:02.180
 But it might be, like you said, unaligned,

1:59:02.180 --> 1:59:03.500
 so it can be all over the place.

1:59:03.500 --> 1:59:04.960
 Yes, and it turns out it doesn't matter.

1:59:04.960 --> 1:59:06.700
 I would have two page flipped screens,

1:59:06.700 --> 1:59:09.120
 as long as they didn't overlap, they moved in series

1:59:09.120 --> 1:59:12.900
 through this two dimensional window of graphics.

1:59:12.900 --> 1:59:15.700
 And that was one of those like, well, this is so simple.

1:59:15.700 --> 1:59:19.420
 This just works, it's faster,

1:59:19.420 --> 1:59:21.740
 there it seemed like there was no downside.

1:59:21.740 --> 1:59:25.540
 Funny thing was, it turned out after we shipped titles

1:59:25.540 --> 1:59:29.660
 with this, there were what they called super VGA cards,

1:59:29.660 --> 1:59:31.940
 the cards that would allow higher resolutions

1:59:31.940 --> 1:59:35.740
 and different features that the standard ones didn't.

1:59:35.740 --> 1:59:38.340
 And on some of those cards,

1:59:38.340 --> 1:59:40.360
 this was a weird compatibility quirk again,

1:59:40.360 --> 1:59:41.900
 because nobody thought this was not

1:59:41.900 --> 1:59:43.580
 what it was designed to do.

1:59:43.580 --> 1:59:45.620
 And some of those cards had more memory.

1:59:45.620 --> 1:59:48.820
 They had more than just 256K and four planes.

1:59:48.820 --> 1:59:51.500
 They had 512K or a megabyte.

1:59:51.500 --> 1:59:55.660
 And on some of those cards, I scroll my window down

1:59:55.660 --> 1:59:57.900
 and then it goes into uninitialized memory

1:59:57.900 --> 1:59:59.060
 that actually exists there

1:59:59.060 --> 2:00:01.740
 rather than wrapping back around at the top.

2:00:01.740 --> 2:00:04.180
 And then I was in the tough position

2:00:04.180 --> 2:00:06.260
 of do I have to track every single one of these?

2:00:06.260 --> 2:00:07.860
 And it was a mad house back then

2:00:07.860 --> 2:00:10.700
 with there were 20 different video card vendors

2:00:10.700 --> 2:00:12.700
 with all slightly different implementations

2:00:12.700 --> 2:00:14.820
 of their nonstandard functionality.

2:00:14.820 --> 2:00:17.540
 So either I needed to natively program

2:00:17.540 --> 2:00:22.080
 all of the VGA cards there to map in that memory

2:00:22.080 --> 2:00:24.320
 and keep scrolling down through all of that,

2:00:24.320 --> 2:00:27.180
 or I kind of punted and took the easy solution

2:00:27.180 --> 2:00:30.300
 of when you finally did run to the edge of the screen,

2:00:30.300 --> 2:00:33.340
 I accepted a hitch and just copied the whole screen up there.

2:00:33.340 --> 2:00:38.340
 So on some of those cards, it was a compatibility mode.

2:00:38.340 --> 2:00:40.140
 In the normal ones, when it all worked fine,

2:00:40.140 --> 2:00:42.060
 everything was just beautifully smooth.

2:00:42.060 --> 2:00:43.460
 But if you had one of those cards

2:00:43.460 --> 2:00:46.340
 where it did not wrap the way I wanted it to,

2:00:46.340 --> 2:00:48.820
 you'd be scrolling around, scrolling around,

2:00:48.820 --> 2:00:50.580
 and then eventually you'd have a little hitch

2:00:50.580 --> 2:00:52.860
 where 200 milliseconds or something

2:00:52.860 --> 2:00:56.100
 that was not super smooth as it froze a little bit.

2:00:56.100 --> 2:00:57.860
 And this is the binary thing.

2:00:57.860 --> 2:00:59.660
 Is it one of the standard screens

2:00:59.660 --> 2:01:02.060
 or is it one of the weird ones, the Super VGA ones?

2:01:02.060 --> 2:01:03.020
 Yeah. Okay.

2:01:03.020 --> 2:01:04.500
 And so we would default to,

2:01:04.500 --> 2:01:05.900
 and I think that was one of those

2:01:05.900 --> 2:01:09.020
 that changed over the kind of course of deployment

2:01:09.020 --> 2:01:11.060
 where early on we would have a normal mode

2:01:11.060 --> 2:01:13.500
 and then you would enable the compatibility flag

2:01:13.500 --> 2:01:16.140
 if your screen did this crazy flickery thing

2:01:16.140 --> 2:01:18.620
 when you got to a certain point in the game.

2:01:18.620 --> 2:01:21.420
 And then later, I think it probably got enabled by default

2:01:21.420 --> 2:01:23.500
 as just more and more of the cards

2:01:23.500 --> 2:01:26.140
 kind of did not do exactly the right thing.

2:01:26.140 --> 2:01:27.500
 And that's the two edged sword

2:01:27.500 --> 2:01:30.340
 of doing unconventional things with technology

2:01:30.340 --> 2:01:33.060
 where you can find something that nobody thought about

2:01:33.060 --> 2:01:34.540
 doing that kind of scrolling trick

2:01:34.540 --> 2:01:36.780
 when they set up those cards.

2:01:36.780 --> 2:01:39.100
 But the fact that nobody thought that was the primary reason

2:01:39.100 --> 2:01:40.820
 when I was relying on that,

2:01:40.820 --> 2:01:44.020
 then I wound up being broken on some of the later cards.

2:01:44.020 --> 2:01:45.740
 Let me take a bit of a tangent,

2:01:45.740 --> 2:01:50.260
 but ask you about the hacker ethic.

2:01:50.260 --> 2:01:51.780
 Cause you mentioned shareware.

2:01:51.780 --> 2:01:53.180
 It's an interesting world.

2:01:53.180 --> 2:01:56.660
 The world of people that make money,

2:01:56.660 --> 2:02:00.500
 the business and the people that build systems,

2:02:00.500 --> 2:02:02.060
 the engineers.

2:02:02.060 --> 2:02:05.980
 And what is the hacker ethic?

2:02:05.980 --> 2:02:08.440
 You've been a man of the people

2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:12.460
 and you've embodied at least the part of that ethic.

2:02:12.460 --> 2:02:13.300
 What does it mean?

2:02:13.300 --> 2:02:14.460
 What did it mean to you at the time?

2:02:14.460 --> 2:02:15.820
 What does it mean to you today?

2:02:15.820 --> 2:02:17.900
 So Steven Levy's book, Hackers,

2:02:17.900 --> 2:02:21.620
 was a really formative book for me as a teenager.

2:02:21.620 --> 2:02:23.660
 I mean, I read it several times

2:02:23.660 --> 2:02:26.020
 and there was all of the great lore

2:02:26.020 --> 2:02:28.980
 of the early MIT era of hackers

2:02:28.980 --> 2:02:31.000
 and ending up at the end with,

2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:34.100
 it kind of went through the early MIT hackers

2:02:34.100 --> 2:02:36.120
 and then the Silicon Valley hardware hackers

2:02:36.120 --> 2:02:39.460
 and then the game hackers in part three.

2:02:39.460 --> 2:02:41.740
 And at that time as a teenager,

2:02:41.740 --> 2:02:44.700
 I really was kind of bitter in some ways.

2:02:44.700 --> 2:02:46.280
 I thought I was born too late.

2:02:46.280 --> 2:02:48.980
 I thought I missed the window there.

2:02:48.980 --> 2:02:52.020
 And I really thought I belonged in that third section

2:02:52.020 --> 2:02:53.620
 of that book with the game hackers.

2:02:53.620 --> 2:02:56.740
 And they were talking about the Williams at Sierra

2:02:56.740 --> 2:02:59.340
 and origin systems with Richard Garriott.

2:02:59.340 --> 2:03:02.540
 And it's like, I really wanted to be there.

2:03:02.540 --> 2:03:05.580
 And I knew that was now a few years in the past.

2:03:05.580 --> 2:03:08.700
 It was not to be,

2:03:08.700 --> 2:03:12.500
 but the early days, especially the early MIT hacker days,

2:03:12.500 --> 2:03:16.100
 talking a lot about this sense of the hacker ethic,

2:03:16.100 --> 2:03:17.980
 that there was this sense that

2:03:17.980 --> 2:03:20.720
 it was about sharing information, being good,

2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:22.460
 not keeping it to yourself,

2:03:22.460 --> 2:03:24.740
 and that it's not a zero sum game,

2:03:24.740 --> 2:03:28.400
 that you can share something with another programmer

2:03:28.400 --> 2:03:30.780
 and it doesn't take it away from you.

2:03:30.780 --> 2:03:33.120
 You then have somebody else doing something.

2:03:33.120 --> 2:03:35.940
 And I also think that there's an aspect of it

2:03:35.940 --> 2:03:39.180
 where it's this ability to take joy

2:03:39.180 --> 2:03:41.200
 in other people's accomplishments,

2:03:41.200 --> 2:03:43.020
 where it's not the cutthroat bit of like,

2:03:43.020 --> 2:03:44.060
 I have to be first,

2:03:44.060 --> 2:03:47.380
 I have to be recognized as the one that did this

2:03:47.380 --> 2:03:48.220
 in some way,

2:03:48.220 --> 2:03:51.560
 but being able to see somebody else do something

2:03:51.560 --> 2:03:53.620
 and say, holy shit, that's amazing.

2:03:53.620 --> 2:03:56.900
 And just taking joy in the ability of something amazing

2:03:56.900 --> 2:03:58.780
 that somebody else does.

2:03:58.780 --> 2:04:03.780
 And the big thing that I was able to do through ID Software

2:04:03.780 --> 2:04:07.160
 was this ability to eventually release the source code

2:04:07.160 --> 2:04:08.080
 for most of our,

2:04:08.080 --> 2:04:10.720
 like all of our really seminal game titles.

2:04:10.720 --> 2:04:13.640
 And that was a, it was a stepping stone process

2:04:13.640 --> 2:04:16.500
 where we were kind of surprised early on

2:04:16.500 --> 2:04:20.120
 where people were able to hack the existing games.

2:04:20.120 --> 2:04:21.540
 And of course I had experience with that.

2:04:21.540 --> 2:04:23.480
 I remember hacking my copies of Ultima.

2:04:23.480 --> 2:04:27.080
 So I'd give myself 9999 gold and raise my levels

2:04:27.080 --> 2:04:29.080
 and break out the sector editor.

2:04:29.080 --> 2:04:31.040
 And so I was familiar with all of that.

2:04:31.040 --> 2:04:33.000
 So it was just, it was with a smile

2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:35.620
 when I started to see people doing that to our games,

2:04:35.620 --> 2:04:38.940
 I am making level editors for Commander Keen

2:04:38.940 --> 2:04:41.820
 or hacking up Wolfenstein 3D,

2:04:41.820 --> 2:04:44.940
 but I made the pitch internally

2:04:44.940 --> 2:04:47.560
 that we should actually release our own tools

2:04:47.560 --> 2:04:51.440
 for like what we did, what we use to create the games.

2:04:51.440 --> 2:04:55.100
 And that was a little bit debatable about,

2:04:55.100 --> 2:04:57.920
 well, will this let other, we'll give people leg up.

2:04:57.920 --> 2:04:58.760
 It's always like,

2:04:58.760 --> 2:05:00.940
 what's that gonna mean for the competition?

2:05:00.940 --> 2:05:04.760
 But the really hard pitch was to actually release

2:05:04.760 --> 2:05:06.800
 the full source code for the games.

2:05:06.800 --> 2:05:10.360
 And it was a balancing act with the other people

2:05:10.360 --> 2:05:13.320
 inside the company where it's interesting

2:05:13.320 --> 2:05:17.060
 how the programmers generally did get,

2:05:17.060 --> 2:05:20.360
 certainly the people that I worked closely with,

2:05:20.360 --> 2:05:22.600
 they did kind of get that hacker ethic bit

2:05:22.600 --> 2:05:24.660
 where you wanted to share your code.

2:05:24.660 --> 2:05:25.780
 You were proud of it.

2:05:25.780 --> 2:05:28.920
 You wanted other people to take it, do cool things with it.

2:05:28.920 --> 2:05:33.880
 But interestingly, the broader game industry

2:05:33.880 --> 2:05:36.520
 is a little more hesitant to embrace that

2:05:36.520 --> 2:05:38.000
 than like the group of people

2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:40.160
 that we happen to have at id Software,

2:05:40.160 --> 2:05:42.520
 where it was always a little interesting to me

2:05:42.520 --> 2:05:45.600
 seeing how a lot of people in the game modding community

2:05:45.600 --> 2:05:47.640
 were very possessive of their code.

2:05:47.640 --> 2:05:49.320
 They did not wanna share their code.

2:05:49.320 --> 2:05:50.560
 They wanted it to be theirs.

2:05:50.560 --> 2:05:52.640
 It was their claim to fame.

2:05:52.640 --> 2:05:55.400
 And that was much more like what we tended to see

2:05:55.400 --> 2:05:58.360
 with artists where the artists understand something

2:05:58.360 --> 2:06:02.200
 about credit and wanting it to be known as their work.

2:06:02.200 --> 2:06:05.320
 And a lot of the game programmers

2:06:05.320 --> 2:06:07.020
 felt a little bit more like artists

2:06:07.020 --> 2:06:08.600
 than like hacker programmers,

2:06:08.600 --> 2:06:11.000
 in that it was about building something

2:06:11.000 --> 2:06:13.000
 that maybe felt more like art to them

2:06:13.000 --> 2:06:16.760
 than the more tool based and exploration based

2:06:16.760 --> 2:06:19.060
 kind of hacking culture side of things.

2:06:19.060 --> 2:06:23.760
 Yeah, it's so interesting that this kind of fear

2:06:23.760 --> 2:06:27.860
 that credit will not be sufficiently attributed to you.

2:06:27.860 --> 2:06:30.400
 And that's one of the things that I do bump into a lot

2:06:30.400 --> 2:06:34.240
 because I try not to go...

2:06:34.240 --> 2:06:35.400
 I mean, it's easy for me to say

2:06:35.400 --> 2:06:37.240
 because so much credit is heaped on me

2:06:37.240 --> 2:06:39.360
 for the id Software side of things.

2:06:39.360 --> 2:06:42.200
 But when people come up and they wanna pick a fight

2:06:42.200 --> 2:06:45.120
 and say, no, it's like that wasn't where first person gaming

2:06:45.120 --> 2:06:48.860
 came from and you can point to some of like things

2:06:48.860 --> 2:06:51.600
 on obscure titles that I was never aware of

2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:53.340
 or like the old Playdoh systems

2:06:53.340 --> 2:06:57.000
 or each personal computer had something that was 3Dish

2:06:57.000 --> 2:06:58.320
 and moving around.

2:06:58.320 --> 2:07:01.200
 And I'm happy to say it's like, no, I mean,

2:07:01.200 --> 2:07:03.900
 I saw Battlezone and Star Wars in the arcades.

2:07:03.900 --> 2:07:06.360
 I had seen 3D graphics, I had seen all these things

2:07:06.360 --> 2:07:09.100
 that are standing on the shoulders of lots of other people.

2:07:09.100 --> 2:07:10.880
 But sometimes these examples they pull out,

2:07:10.880 --> 2:07:12.540
 it's like, no, I didn't know that existed.

2:07:12.540 --> 2:07:15.280
 I mean, I had never heard of that before then

2:07:15.280 --> 2:07:17.840
 that didn't contribute to what I made,

2:07:17.840 --> 2:07:19.480
 but there's plenty of stuff that did.

2:07:19.480 --> 2:07:23.280
 And I think there's good cases to be made

2:07:23.280 --> 2:07:26.160
 that obviously Doom and Quake and Wolfenstein

2:07:26.160 --> 2:07:29.800
 were formative examples for what everything

2:07:29.800 --> 2:07:31.720
 that came after that.

2:07:31.720 --> 2:07:34.160
 But I don't feel the need to go fight

2:07:34.160 --> 2:07:37.480
 and say claim primacy or initial invention

2:07:37.480 --> 2:07:38.800
 of anything like that.

2:07:38.800 --> 2:07:40.440
 But a lot of people do want to.

2:07:40.440 --> 2:07:43.200
 I think when you fight for the credit in that way

2:07:43.200 --> 2:07:45.260
 and it does go against the hacker ethic,

2:07:46.280 --> 2:07:48.800
 you destroy something fundamental about the culture,

2:07:48.800 --> 2:07:51.760
 about the community that builds cool stuff.

2:07:51.760 --> 2:07:53.780
 I think credit ultimately,

2:07:53.780 --> 2:07:58.420
 so I had this sort of,

2:07:58.420 --> 2:08:00.980
 there's a famous wrestler and freestyle wrestling

2:08:00.980 --> 2:08:03.980
 called Buvai Sarasateeva.

2:08:03.980 --> 2:08:07.760
 And he always preached that you should just focus

2:08:07.760 --> 2:08:10.740
 on the art of the wrestling and let people

2:08:12.740 --> 2:08:15.940
 write your story however they want.

2:08:15.940 --> 2:08:20.100
 The highest form of the art is just focusing on the art.

2:08:20.100 --> 2:08:23.760
 And that is something about the hacker ethic

2:08:23.760 --> 2:08:26.900
 is just focus on building cool stuff,

2:08:26.900 --> 2:08:29.380
 sharing it with other cool people,

2:08:29.380 --> 2:08:32.500
 and credit will get assigned correctly

2:08:35.060 --> 2:08:37.240
 in the long arc of history.

2:08:37.240 --> 2:08:39.180
 Yeah, and I generally think that's true.

2:08:39.180 --> 2:08:40.060
 And you've got,

2:08:42.020 --> 2:08:44.220
 there's some things, there's a graphics technique

2:08:44.220 --> 2:08:46.220
 that got labeled CarMax Reverse.

2:08:46.220 --> 2:08:48.380
 I am literally named,

2:08:48.380 --> 2:08:50.300
 and it turned out that I wasn't the first person

2:08:50.300 --> 2:08:51.860
 to figure that out.

2:08:51.860 --> 2:08:54.700
 Most scientific things or mathematical things you wind up,

2:08:54.700 --> 2:08:56.220
 it's like, oh, this other person

2:08:56.220 --> 2:08:58.580
 had actually done that somewhat before.

2:08:58.580 --> 2:09:00.300
 And then there's things that get attributed to me

2:09:00.300 --> 2:09:03.300
 like the inverse square root hack that I actually didn't do.

2:09:03.300 --> 2:09:04.760
 I flat out, that wasn't me.

2:09:04.760 --> 2:09:07.260
 And it's like, it's weird how the memetic power

2:09:07.260 --> 2:09:09.100
 of the internet, I cannot convince people of that.

2:09:09.100 --> 2:09:10.980
 You're like the Mark Twain of programming.

2:09:10.980 --> 2:09:12.140
 Yes.

2:09:12.140 --> 2:09:14.060
 Everything just gets attributed to you now,

2:09:14.060 --> 2:09:17.380
 even though you've never sought the credit of things.

2:09:18.300 --> 2:09:21.220
 But part of the fact of the humility behind that

2:09:21.220 --> 2:09:24.100
 is what attracts the attributions.

2:09:25.340 --> 2:09:27.820
 Let's talk about a game.

2:09:27.820 --> 2:09:29.580
 I mean, one of the greatest games ever made.

2:09:29.580 --> 2:09:31.500
 I know you could talk about doing Quake and so on,

2:09:31.500 --> 2:09:33.700
 but to me, Wolfenstein 3D was like, whoa.

2:09:35.340 --> 2:09:38.180
 It blew my mind that a world like this could exist.

2:09:38.180 --> 2:09:40.900
 So how did Wolfenstein 3D come to be

2:09:42.080 --> 2:09:44.260
 in terms of the programming, in terms of the design,

2:09:44.260 --> 2:09:47.240
 in terms of some of the memorable technical challenges?

2:09:47.240 --> 2:09:50.600
 And also, actually just something you haven't mentioned

2:09:50.600 --> 2:09:55.600
 is how did these ideas come to be inside your mind,

2:09:58.120 --> 2:10:00.560
 the adaptive side scrolling,

2:10:00.560 --> 2:10:03.560
 the solutions to these technical challenges?

2:10:03.560 --> 2:10:06.900
 So I usually can introspectively pull back

2:10:06.900 --> 2:10:11.360
 pretty detailed accounts of how technology solutions

2:10:11.360 --> 2:10:14.000
 and design choices on my part came to be,

2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:17.400
 where technically we had done two games,

2:10:17.400 --> 2:10:19.200
 3D games like that before,

2:10:19.200 --> 2:10:20.960
 where Hover Tank was the first one,

2:10:20.960 --> 2:10:22.760
 which had flat shaded walls,

2:10:22.760 --> 2:10:25.240
 but did have the scaled enemies inside it.

2:10:25.240 --> 2:10:28.920
 And then Catacombs 3D, which had textured walls,

2:10:28.920 --> 2:10:33.920
 scaled enemies, and some more functionality,

2:10:34.160 --> 2:10:37.160
 like the disappearing walls and some other stuff.

2:10:37.160 --> 2:10:38.680
 But what's really interesting

2:10:38.680 --> 2:10:41.980
 from a game development standpoint is those games,

2:10:41.980 --> 2:10:45.000
 Catacombs 3D, Hover Tank, and Wolfenstein,

2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:48.240
 they literally used the same code

2:10:48.240 --> 2:10:50.280
 for a lot of the character behavior

2:10:50.280 --> 2:10:54.140
 that a 2D game that I had made earlier called Catacombs did,

2:10:54.140 --> 2:10:56.740
 where it was an overhead view game, kind of like Gauntlet,

2:10:56.740 --> 2:10:58.800
 you're running around and you can open up doors,

2:10:58.800 --> 2:11:01.280
 pick up items, basic game stuff.

2:11:01.280 --> 2:11:06.280
 And the thought was that this exact same game experience

2:11:06.520 --> 2:11:09.080
 just presented in a different perspective.

2:11:09.080 --> 2:11:11.380
 It could be literally the same game

2:11:11.380 --> 2:11:13.480
 just with a different view into it,

2:11:13.480 --> 2:11:16.880
 would have a dramatically different impact on the players.

2:11:16.880 --> 2:11:20.280
 So it wasn't a true 3D,

2:11:20.280 --> 2:11:22.440
 you're saying that you could kind of fake it,

2:11:22.440 --> 2:11:24.160
 you can like scale enemies,

2:11:24.160 --> 2:11:25.720
 meaning things that are farther away,

2:11:25.720 --> 2:11:27.440
 you can make them smaller.

2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:29.760
 So the game was a 2D map,

2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:33.040
 like all of our games use the same tool for creation.

2:11:33.040 --> 2:11:36.320
 We use the same map editor for creating Keen as Wolfenstein

2:11:36.320 --> 2:11:39.100
 and Hover Tank and Catacombs and all this stuff.

2:11:39.100 --> 2:11:42.680
 So the game was a 2D grid made out of blocks.

2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:44.480
 And you could say, well, these are walls,

2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:45.880
 these are where the enemies start,

2:11:45.880 --> 2:11:47.700
 then they start moving around.

2:11:47.700 --> 2:11:49.600
 And these early games like Catacombs,

2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:51.600
 you played it strictly in a 2D view.

2:11:51.600 --> 2:11:53.200
 It was a scrolling 2D view,

2:11:53.200 --> 2:11:55.320
 and that was kind of using an adaptive tile refresh

2:11:55.320 --> 2:11:58.440
 at the time to be able to do something like that.

2:11:58.440 --> 2:12:01.620
 And then the thought that these early games,

2:12:01.620 --> 2:12:04.600
 all it did was take the same basic enemy logic,

2:12:04.600 --> 2:12:07.680
 but instead of seeing it from the God's eye view on top,

2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:10.480
 you were inside it and turning from side to side,

2:12:10.480 --> 2:12:12.640
 yawing your view and moving forwards and backwards

2:12:12.640 --> 2:12:14.520
 and side to side.

2:12:14.520 --> 2:12:17.160
 And it's a striking thing where you always talk about

2:12:17.160 --> 2:12:20.040
 wanting to isolate and factor changes in values.

2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:22.360
 And this was one of those most pure cases there

2:12:22.360 --> 2:12:25.040
 where the rest of the game changed very little.

2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:27.840
 It was our normal kind of change the colors on something

2:12:27.840 --> 2:12:29.200
 and draw a different picture for it,

2:12:29.200 --> 2:12:30.880
 but it's kind of the same thing.

2:12:30.880 --> 2:12:33.960
 But the perspective changed in a really fundamental way.

2:12:33.960 --> 2:12:36.280
 And it was dramatically different.

2:12:36.280 --> 2:12:40.600
 I can remember the reactions where the artist, Adrian,

2:12:40.600 --> 2:12:42.040
 that had been drawing the pictures for it.

2:12:42.040 --> 2:12:45.000
 We had a cool big troll thing in Catacombs 3D,

2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:47.720
 and we had these walls that you could get a key

2:12:47.720 --> 2:12:49.840
 and you could make the blocks disappear,

2:12:49.840 --> 2:12:51.000
 get really simple stuff.

2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:52.920
 Blocks could either be there or not there.

2:12:52.920 --> 2:12:55.980
 So our idea of a door was being able to make a set of blocks

2:12:55.980 --> 2:12:57.300
 just disappear.

2:12:57.300 --> 2:12:58.640
 And I remember the reaction

2:12:58.640 --> 2:13:00.080
 where he had drawn these characters

2:13:00.080 --> 2:13:01.720
 and he was slowly moving around

2:13:01.720 --> 2:13:04.480
 and like people had no experience with 3D navigation.

2:13:04.480 --> 2:13:05.460
 It was all still keyboard.

2:13:05.460 --> 2:13:08.520
 We didn't even have mice set up at that time,

2:13:08.520 --> 2:13:12.300
 but slowly moving, going up, picked up a key, go to a wall.

2:13:12.300 --> 2:13:14.360
 The wall disappears in a little animation

2:13:14.360 --> 2:13:16.320
 and there's a monster like right there.

2:13:16.320 --> 2:13:18.000
 And he practically fell out of his chair.

2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:19.260
 It was just like, ah!

2:13:19.260 --> 2:13:22.480
 And games just didn't do that.

2:13:22.480 --> 2:13:24.360
 The games were the God's eye view.

2:13:24.360 --> 2:13:26.320
 You were a little invested in your little guy.

2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:29.760
 You can be like happy or sad when things happen,

2:13:29.760 --> 2:13:32.440
 but you just did not get that kind of startle reaction.

2:13:32.440 --> 2:13:33.920
 You weren't inside the game.

2:13:33.920 --> 2:13:35.560
 Something in the back of your brain,

2:13:35.560 --> 2:13:37.760
 some reptile brain thing is just going,

2:13:37.760 --> 2:13:39.960
 oh shit, something just happened.

2:13:39.960 --> 2:13:42.520
 And that was one of those early points where it's like,

2:13:42.520 --> 2:13:44.800
 yeah, this is gonna make a difference.

2:13:44.800 --> 2:13:47.440
 This is going to be powerful and it's gonna matter.

2:13:47.440 --> 2:13:51.120
 Were you able to imagine that in the idea stage or no?

2:13:51.120 --> 2:13:53.720
 So not that exact thing.

2:13:53.720 --> 2:13:56.480
 So again, we had cases like the arcade games,

2:13:56.480 --> 2:13:58.000
 Battle Zone and Star Wars

2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:00.160
 that you could kind of see a 3D world

2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:03.460
 and things coming at you and you get some sense of it,

2:14:03.460 --> 2:14:06.440
 but nothing had done the kind of worlds that we were doing

2:14:06.440 --> 2:14:08.480
 and the sort of action based things.

2:14:08.480 --> 2:14:12.100
 3D at the time was really largely

2:14:12.100 --> 2:14:14.240
 about the simulation thoughts.

2:14:14.240 --> 2:14:16.320
 And this is something that really

2:14:16.320 --> 2:14:18.120
 might have trended differently

2:14:18.120 --> 2:14:20.960
 if not for the id Software approach in the games

2:14:20.960 --> 2:14:23.560
 where there were flight simulators,

2:14:23.560 --> 2:14:24.920
 there were driving simulators,

2:14:24.920 --> 2:14:28.400
 you had like hard drive in and Microsoft flight simulator.

2:14:28.400 --> 2:14:31.360
 And these were doing 3D and general purpose 3D

2:14:31.360 --> 2:14:33.760
 in ways that were more flexible

2:14:33.760 --> 2:14:35.440
 than what we were doing with our games,

2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:38.000
 but they were looked at as simulations.

2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:42.000
 They weren't trying to necessarily be fast or responsive

2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:44.840
 or letting you do kind of exciting maneuvers

2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:46.800
 because they were trying to simulate reality

2:14:46.800 --> 2:14:49.280
 and they were taking their cues from the big systems,

2:14:49.280 --> 2:14:51.500
 the Evans and Sutherlands and the Silicon Graphics

2:14:51.500 --> 2:14:52.860
 that were doing things.

2:14:52.860 --> 2:14:54.600
 But we were taking our cues

2:14:54.600 --> 2:14:56.560
 from the console and arcade games.

2:14:56.560 --> 2:14:59.480
 We wanted things that were sort of quarter eaters

2:14:59.480 --> 2:15:01.160
 that were doing fast paced things

2:15:01.160 --> 2:15:02.780
 that you could smack you around

2:15:02.780 --> 2:15:06.180
 rather than just smoothly gliding you from place to place.

2:15:06.180 --> 2:15:07.020
 So.

2:15:07.020 --> 2:15:07.840
 Quarter eaters.

2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:08.680
 Yeah.

2:15:08.680 --> 2:15:10.200
 And you know, a funny thing is,

2:15:10.200 --> 2:15:12.280
 so much that that built into us

2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:15.080
 that Wolfenstein still had lives

2:15:15.080 --> 2:15:16.540
 and you had like one of the biggest power ups

2:15:16.540 --> 2:15:18.800
 in all these games like was an extra life

2:15:18.800 --> 2:15:20.560
 because you started off with three lives

2:15:20.560 --> 2:15:23.080
 and you lose your lives and then it's game over

2:15:23.080 --> 2:15:26.240
 and there weren't save games in most of this stuff.

2:15:26.240 --> 2:15:28.760
 It was, it sounds almost crazy to say this,

2:15:28.760 --> 2:15:30.680
 but it was an innovation in Doom

2:15:30.680 --> 2:15:32.160
 to not have lives.

2:15:32.160 --> 2:15:33.860
 You know, you could just play Doom as long as you wanted.

2:15:33.860 --> 2:15:36.760
 You just restart at the start of the level and why not?

2:15:36.760 --> 2:15:39.760
 This is like, we aren't trying to take people's quarters.

2:15:39.760 --> 2:15:41.360
 They've already paid for the entire game.

2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:43.360
 We want them to have a good time

2:15:43.360 --> 2:15:45.520
 and you would have some, you know,

2:15:45.520 --> 2:15:47.240
 some old timer purists that might think

2:15:47.240 --> 2:15:48.940
 that there's something to the epic journey

2:15:48.940 --> 2:15:50.040
 of making it to the end,

2:15:50.040 --> 2:15:52.040
 having to restart all the way from the beginning

2:15:52.040 --> 2:15:53.440
 after a certain number of tries.

2:15:53.440 --> 2:15:56.340
 But now more fun is had when you just let people

2:15:56.340 --> 2:15:58.040
 kind of keep trying when they're stuck

2:15:58.040 --> 2:15:59.760
 rather than having to go all the way back

2:15:59.760 --> 2:16:01.920
 and learn different things.

2:16:01.920 --> 2:16:03.280
 So you've recommended the book,

2:16:03.280 --> 2:16:05.760
 Game Engine Black Book Wolfenstein 3D

2:16:05.760 --> 2:16:07.600
 for technical exploration of the game.

2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:10.560
 So looking back 30 years,

2:16:10.560 --> 2:16:13.260
 what are some memorable technical innovations

2:16:13.260 --> 2:16:16.920
 that made this perspective shift into this world

2:16:16.920 --> 2:16:20.160
 that's so immersive that scares you when a monster appears

2:16:20.160 --> 2:16:22.260
 or some things you have to solve?

2:16:22.260 --> 2:16:24.140
 So one of the interesting things

2:16:24.140 --> 2:16:26.300
 that come back to the theme of deadlines

2:16:26.300 --> 2:16:27.760
 and resource constraints,

2:16:27.760 --> 2:16:30.040
 the game Catacombs 3D,

2:16:31.120 --> 2:16:33.140
 we shipped, we were supposed to be shipping this

2:16:33.140 --> 2:16:36.440
 for Gamers Edge on a monthly cadence and I had slipped.

2:16:36.440 --> 2:16:37.840
 I was actually late.

2:16:37.840 --> 2:16:39.240
 It slipped like six weeks

2:16:39.240 --> 2:16:41.580
 because this was texture mapped walls

2:16:41.580 --> 2:16:44.760
 doing stuff that I hadn't done before.

2:16:44.760 --> 2:16:46.740
 And at the six week point,

2:16:46.740 --> 2:16:48.980
 it was still kind of glitchy and buggy.

2:16:48.980 --> 2:16:51.600
 There were things that I knew that if you had a wall

2:16:51.600 --> 2:16:54.600
 that was like almost edge on, you could slide over to it

2:16:54.600 --> 2:16:56.040
 and you could see some things freak out

2:16:56.040 --> 2:16:57.640
 or vanish or not work.

2:16:57.640 --> 2:16:59.920
 And I hated that,

2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:01.500
 but I was up against the wall.

2:17:01.500 --> 2:17:03.000
 We had to ship the game.

2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:04.680
 It was still a lot of fun to play.

2:17:04.680 --> 2:17:06.000
 It was novel, nobody had seen it.

2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:09.040
 It gave you that startle reflex reaction.

2:17:09.040 --> 2:17:11.040
 So it was worth shipping,

2:17:11.040 --> 2:17:13.980
 but it had these things that I knew were kind of flaky

2:17:13.980 --> 2:17:17.440
 and janky and not what I was really proud of.

2:17:17.440 --> 2:17:20.720
 So one of the things that I did very differently

2:17:20.720 --> 2:17:24.000
 in Wolfenstein was I went,

2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:27.200
 Catacombs used almost a conventional thing

2:17:27.200 --> 2:17:30.240
 where you had segments that were one dimensional polygons

2:17:30.240 --> 2:17:33.080
 basically that were clipped and back faced

2:17:33.080 --> 2:17:36.320
 and done kind of like a very crude 3D engine

2:17:36.320 --> 2:17:37.340
 from the professionals,

2:17:37.340 --> 2:17:39.500
 but I wasn't getting it done right.

2:17:39.500 --> 2:17:41.520
 I was not doing a good enough job.

2:17:41.520 --> 2:17:45.500
 I didn't really have line of sight to fix it right.

2:17:45.500 --> 2:17:46.920
 There's stuff that of course I look back,

2:17:46.920 --> 2:17:48.640
 it's like, oh, it's obvious how to do this

2:17:48.640 --> 2:17:51.000
 and do the math right, do your clipping right,

2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:53.240
 check all of this, how you handle the precision.

2:17:53.240 --> 2:17:55.680
 But I did not know how to do that at that time.

2:17:55.680 --> 2:17:59.000
 Was that the first 3D engine you wrote Catacombs 3D?

2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:00.840
 Yeah, Hover Tank had been a little bit before that,

2:18:00.840 --> 2:18:02.440
 but that had the flat shaded walls.

2:18:02.440 --> 2:18:04.520
 So the texture mapping on the walls

2:18:04.520 --> 2:18:06.840
 was what was bringing in some of these challenges

2:18:06.840 --> 2:18:08.920
 that was hard for me

2:18:08.920 --> 2:18:11.080
 and I couldn't solve it right at the time.

2:18:11.080 --> 2:18:13.440
 Can you describe what flat shading is and texture mapping?

2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:16.020
 So the walls were solid color,

2:18:16.020 --> 2:18:19.280
 one of 16 colors in Hover Tank.

2:18:19.280 --> 2:18:20.800
 So that's easy, it's fast,

2:18:20.800 --> 2:18:23.640
 you just draw the solid color for everything.

2:18:23.640 --> 2:18:25.560
 Texture mapping is what we all see today

2:18:25.560 --> 2:18:28.060
 where you have an image that is stretched and distorted

2:18:28.060 --> 2:18:31.000
 onto the walls or the surfaces that you're working with.

2:18:32.120 --> 2:18:35.280
 And it was a long time for me to just figure out

2:18:35.280 --> 2:18:38.520
 how to do that without it distorting in the wrong ways.

2:18:38.520 --> 2:18:42.360
 And I did not get it all exactly right in Catacombs

2:18:42.360 --> 2:18:44.840
 and I had these flaws.

2:18:44.840 --> 2:18:46.740
 So that was important enough to me

2:18:46.740 --> 2:18:49.360
 that rather than continuing to bang my head on that

2:18:49.360 --> 2:18:51.800
 when I wasn't positive I was gonna get it,

2:18:51.800 --> 2:18:53.440
 I went with a completely different approach

2:18:53.440 --> 2:18:56.400
 for drawing for figuring out where the walls were

2:18:56.400 --> 2:18:58.580
 which was a ray casting approach,

2:18:58.580 --> 2:19:02.680
 which I had done in Catacombs 3D I had a bunch of C code

2:19:02.680 --> 2:19:05.840
 trying to make this work right and it wasn't working right.

2:19:05.840 --> 2:19:09.880
 In Wolfenstein I wound up going to a very small amount

2:19:09.880 --> 2:19:11.160
 of assembly code.

2:19:11.160 --> 2:19:14.360
 So in some ways there should be a slower way of doing it

2:19:14.360 --> 2:19:16.520
 but by making it a smaller amount of work

2:19:16.520 --> 2:19:19.280
 that I could more tightly optimize it worked out

2:19:19.280 --> 2:19:22.780
 and Wolfenstein 3D was just absolutely rock solid.

2:19:22.780 --> 2:19:25.480
 It was nothing glitched in there.

2:19:25.480 --> 2:19:28.280
 The game just was pretty much flawless through all of that

2:19:28.280 --> 2:19:29.840
 and I was super proud of that.

2:19:31.160 --> 2:19:33.240
 But eventually like in the later games

2:19:33.240 --> 2:19:35.640
 I went back to the more span based things

2:19:35.640 --> 2:19:37.620
 where I could get more total efficiency

2:19:37.620 --> 2:19:40.100
 once I really did figure out how to do it.

2:19:40.100 --> 2:19:42.640
 So there were two sort of key technical things

2:19:42.640 --> 2:19:45.840
 to Wolfenstein, one was this ray casting approach

2:19:45.840 --> 2:19:48.780
 which you still to this day you see people go and say

2:19:48.780 --> 2:19:50.480
 let's write a ray casting engine

2:19:50.480 --> 2:19:53.140
 because it's an understandable way of doing things

2:19:53.140 --> 2:19:55.700
 that lets you make games very much like that.

2:19:55.700 --> 2:19:57.620
 So you see ray casters in JavaScript,

2:19:57.620 --> 2:20:00.640
 ray casters in Python, people that are basically going

2:20:00.640 --> 2:20:04.960
 and re implementing that approach to taking a tiled world

2:20:04.960 --> 2:20:06.480
 and casting out into it.

2:20:06.480 --> 2:20:08.760
 It works pretty well but it's not the fastest way

2:20:08.760 --> 2:20:09.600
 of doing it.

2:20:09.600 --> 2:20:11.380
 Can you describe what ray casting is?

2:20:11.380 --> 2:20:13.420
 So you start off and you've got your screen

2:20:13.420 --> 2:20:15.780
 which is 320 pixels across at the time

2:20:15.780 --> 2:20:19.780
 if you haven't sized down the window for greater speed

2:20:19.780 --> 2:20:22.480
 and at every pixel there's gonna be an angle

2:20:22.480 --> 2:20:24.520
 from you've got your position in the world

2:20:24.520 --> 2:20:26.920
 and you're going to just run along that angle

2:20:26.920 --> 2:20:29.160
 and keep going until you hit a block.

2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:32.040
 So up to 320 times across there

2:20:32.040 --> 2:20:35.520
 it's gonna throw a cast array out into the world

2:20:35.520 --> 2:20:38.660
 from wherever your origin is until it runs into a wall

2:20:38.660 --> 2:20:42.140
 and then it can figure out exactly where on the wall it hits.

2:20:42.140 --> 2:20:45.400
 The performance challenge of that is as it's going out

2:20:45.400 --> 2:20:49.240
 every block it's crossing it checks is this a solid wall.

2:20:49.240 --> 2:20:52.480
 So that means that in like the early Wolfenstein levels

2:20:52.480 --> 2:20:55.880
 you're in a small jail cell going out into a small hallway

2:20:55.880 --> 2:20:57.180
 it's super efficient for that

2:20:57.180 --> 2:21:00.200
 because you're only stepping across three or four blocks

2:21:00.200 --> 2:21:02.480
 but then if somebody makes a room that covers

2:21:02.480 --> 2:21:05.520
 our maps were limited to 64 by 64 blocks.

2:21:05.520 --> 2:21:08.700
 If you made one room that was nothing but walls

2:21:08.700 --> 2:21:11.000
 at the far space it would go pretty slow

2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:14.440
 because it would be stepping across 80 tile tests

2:21:14.440 --> 2:21:15.880
 or something along the way.

2:21:15.880 --> 2:21:17.480
 By the way the physics of our universe

2:21:17.480 --> 2:21:19.000
 seems to be competing in this very thing.

2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:23.080
 So this maps nicely to the actual physics of our world.

2:21:23.080 --> 2:21:25.440
 Yeah you get like I follow a little bit of something

2:21:25.440 --> 2:21:28.680
 like Steven Wolfram's work on interconnected

2:21:28.680 --> 2:21:30.600
 network information states of that

2:21:30.600 --> 2:21:34.560
 and that's it's beyond what I can have an informed opinion

2:21:34.560 --> 2:21:37.680
 on but it's interesting that people are considering

2:21:37.680 --> 2:21:41.600
 things like that and have things that can back it up.

2:21:42.840 --> 2:21:44.200
 Yeah there's whole different sets

2:21:44.200 --> 2:21:45.720
 of interesting stuff there.

2:21:45.720 --> 2:21:48.200
 So Wolfenstein 3D had ray casting.

2:21:48.200 --> 2:21:51.080
 Ray casting and then the other kind of key aspect

2:21:51.080 --> 2:21:53.920
 was what I called compiled scalers

2:21:53.920 --> 2:21:58.600
 where the idea of you'd saw this in the earlier

2:21:58.600 --> 2:22:01.160
 classic arcade games like Space Harrier and stuff

2:22:01.160 --> 2:22:04.240
 where you would take a picture which is normally drawn

2:22:04.240 --> 2:22:06.840
 directly on the screen and then if you have the ability

2:22:06.840 --> 2:22:09.360
 to make it bigger or smaller big chunky pixels

2:22:09.360 --> 2:22:12.180
 or fizzly small drop sampled pixels.

2:22:12.180 --> 2:22:15.080
 That's the fundamental aspect of what our characters

2:22:15.080 --> 2:22:16.520
 were doing in these 3D games.

2:22:16.520 --> 2:22:18.380
 You would have it's just like you might have drawn

2:22:18.380 --> 2:22:20.200
 a tiny little character but now we can make them

2:22:20.200 --> 2:22:23.220
 really big and make them really small and move it around.

2:22:23.220 --> 2:22:26.480
 That was the limited kind of 3D that we had for characters.

2:22:26.480 --> 2:22:27.960
 To make them turn there were literally

2:22:27.960 --> 2:22:29.560
 eight different views of them.

2:22:29.560 --> 2:22:31.800
 You didn't actually have a 3D model that would rotate.

2:22:31.800 --> 2:22:33.780
 You just had these cardboard cutouts.

2:22:33.780 --> 2:22:36.760
 But that was good enough for that startle fight reaction

2:22:36.760 --> 2:22:40.080
 and it was kind of what we had to deal with there.

2:22:40.080 --> 2:22:42.280
 So a straightforward approach to do that

2:22:42.280 --> 2:22:44.600
 you could just write out your doubly nested loop

2:22:44.600 --> 2:22:47.080
 of you've got your stretch factor

2:22:47.080 --> 2:22:48.080
 and it's like you've got a point,

2:22:48.080 --> 2:22:49.400
 you stretch by a little bit,

2:22:49.400 --> 2:22:50.680
 it might be on the same pixel,

2:22:50.680 --> 2:22:51.680
 it might be on the next pixel,

2:22:51.680 --> 2:22:53.860
 it might have skipped a pixel.

2:22:53.860 --> 2:22:56.080
 You can write that out but it's not gonna be fast enough

2:22:56.080 --> 2:22:58.480
 where especially you get a character for that

2:22:58.480 --> 2:23:00.480
 right in your face monster covering

2:23:00.480 --> 2:23:02.200
 almost the entire screen.

2:23:02.200 --> 2:23:05.080
 Doing that with a general purpose scaling routine

2:23:05.080 --> 2:23:06.520
 would have just been much too slow.

2:23:06.520 --> 2:23:08.320
 It would have worked when they're small characters

2:23:08.320 --> 2:23:09.840
 but then it would get slower and slower

2:23:09.840 --> 2:23:12.160
 as they got closer to you until right at the time

2:23:12.160 --> 2:23:15.320
 when you most care about having a fast reaction time,

2:23:15.320 --> 2:23:17.320
 the game would be chunking down.

2:23:17.320 --> 2:23:22.320
 So the fastest possible way to draw pixels at that time

2:23:22.400 --> 2:23:27.400
 was to, instead of saying I've got a general purpose

2:23:28.720 --> 2:23:31.500
 version that can handle any scale,

2:23:31.500 --> 2:23:35.320
 I used a program to make essentially

2:23:35.320 --> 2:23:37.620
 a hundred or more separate little programs

2:23:37.620 --> 2:23:40.200
 that was optimized for I will take an image

2:23:40.200 --> 2:23:42.200
 and I will draw it 12 pixels tall.

2:23:42.200 --> 2:23:44.680
 I'll take an image, I'll draw it 14 pixels tall

2:23:44.680 --> 2:23:47.680
 up by every two pixels even for that.

2:23:47.680 --> 2:23:50.280
 So you would have the most optimized code

2:23:50.280 --> 2:23:52.040
 so that in the normal case

2:23:52.040 --> 2:23:55.320
 where most of the world is fairly large,

2:23:55.320 --> 2:23:57.000
 like the pixels are big,

2:23:57.000 --> 2:23:58.640
 we did not have a lot of memory.

2:23:58.640 --> 2:24:01.600
 So in most cases that meant that you would load

2:24:01.600 --> 2:24:05.240
 a pixel color and then you would store it multiple times.

2:24:05.240 --> 2:24:09.040
 So that was faster than even copying an image

2:24:09.040 --> 2:24:10.720
 in a normal conventional case

2:24:10.720 --> 2:24:13.240
 because most of the time the image is expanded.

2:24:13.240 --> 2:24:16.600
 So instead of doing one read, one write for a simple copy,

2:24:16.600 --> 2:24:19.120
 you might be doing one read and three or four writes

2:24:19.120 --> 2:24:20.480
 as it got really big.

2:24:20.480 --> 2:24:22.320
 And that had the beneficial aspect

2:24:22.320 --> 2:24:24.360
 of just when you needed the performance most

2:24:24.360 --> 2:24:25.980
 when things are covering the screen,

2:24:25.980 --> 2:24:28.600
 it was giving you the most acceleration for that.

2:24:28.600 --> 2:24:32.480
 By the way, were you able to understand this

2:24:32.480 --> 2:24:34.720
 through thinking about it or were you testing

2:24:34.720 --> 2:24:36.640
 like the right speed and like that?

2:24:36.640 --> 2:24:40.160
 This again comes back to, I can find the antecedents

2:24:40.160 --> 2:24:41.120
 for things like this.

2:24:41.120 --> 2:24:45.400
 So back in the Apple II days,

2:24:45.400 --> 2:24:49.560
 the graphics were essentially single bits at a time.

2:24:49.560 --> 2:24:51.760
 And if you wanted to make your little spaceship,

2:24:51.760 --> 2:24:54.880
 if you wanted to make it smoothly go across the world,

2:24:54.880 --> 2:24:56.720
 if you just took the image and you drew it out

2:24:56.720 --> 2:24:59.360
 at the next location, you would move by seven pixels

2:24:59.360 --> 2:25:01.320
 at a time, so it'd go chunk, chunk, chunk.

2:25:01.320 --> 2:25:03.240
 If you wanted to make it move smoothly,

2:25:03.240 --> 2:25:05.880
 you actually had to make seven versions of the ship

2:25:05.880 --> 2:25:07.360
 that were pre shifted.

2:25:07.360 --> 2:25:09.920
 You could write a program that would shift it dynamically,

2:25:09.920 --> 2:25:11.460
 but on a one megahertz processor,

2:25:11.460 --> 2:25:13.180
 that's not going anywhere fast.

2:25:13.180 --> 2:25:16.660
 So if you wanted to do a smooth moving fast action game,

2:25:16.660 --> 2:25:20.440
 you made separate versions of each of these sprites.

2:25:20.440 --> 2:25:22.360
 Now there were a few more tricks you could pull

2:25:22.360 --> 2:25:24.480
 that if it still wasn't fast enough,

2:25:24.480 --> 2:25:26.900
 you could make a compiled shape

2:25:26.900 --> 2:25:31.200
 where instead of this program that normally copies an image

2:25:31.200 --> 2:25:33.760
 and says like, get this byte from here, stored here,

2:25:33.760 --> 2:25:35.400
 get this byte, store this byte.

2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:38.440
 If you've got the memory space, you could say,

2:25:38.440 --> 2:25:39.800
 I'm going to write the program

2:25:39.800 --> 2:25:41.960
 that does nothing but draw this shape.

2:25:41.960 --> 2:25:43.100
 It's going to be like,

2:25:43.100 --> 2:25:46.640
 I'm going to load the immediate value 25,

2:25:46.640 --> 2:25:47.920
 which is some bit pattern,

2:25:47.920 --> 2:25:51.340
 and then I'm going to store that at this location.

2:25:51.340 --> 2:25:53.280
 Rather than loading something from memory

2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:56.880
 that involved indexing registers and this other slow stuff,

2:25:56.880 --> 2:25:57.720
 you could go ahead and say,

2:25:57.720 --> 2:26:00.020
 no, I'm gonna hard code the exact values

2:26:00.020 --> 2:26:02.460
 of all of the image right into the program.

2:26:02.460 --> 2:26:04.120
 And this was always a horrible trade off there,

2:26:04.120 --> 2:26:05.360
 which you didn't have much memory

2:26:05.360 --> 2:26:07.000
 and you didn't have much speed.

2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:09.600
 But if you had something that you wanted to go really fast,

2:26:09.600 --> 2:26:11.800
 you could turn it into a program.

2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:14.560
 And that was, knowing about that technique

2:26:14.560 --> 2:26:17.640
 is what made me think about some of these unwinding it

2:26:17.640 --> 2:26:19.760
 for the PC where people that didn't come

2:26:19.760 --> 2:26:23.360
 from that background were less likely to think about that.

2:26:23.360 --> 2:26:25.200
 I mean, there's some deep parallels

2:26:25.200 --> 2:26:27.500
 probably to human cognition as well.

2:26:27.500 --> 2:26:34.560
 There's something about optimizing and compressing

2:26:34.560 --> 2:26:36.800
 the processing of a new information

2:26:36.800 --> 2:26:39.760
 that requires you to predict the possible ways

2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:44.440
 in which the game or the world might unroll.

2:26:44.440 --> 2:26:47.440
 And you have something like compiled scaler is always there.

2:26:47.440 --> 2:26:51.400
 So you have like, like you have a prediction

2:26:51.400 --> 2:26:52.720
 of how the world will unroll

2:26:52.720 --> 2:26:57.060
 and you have some kind of optimized data structure

2:26:57.060 --> 2:26:58.200
 for that prediction.

2:26:58.200 --> 2:27:00.440
 And then you can modify if the world turns out

2:27:00.440 --> 2:27:02.320
 to be different, you can modify a slight way.

2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:04.180
 And as far as building out techniques,

2:27:04.180 --> 2:27:06.960
 so much of the brain is about the associative context.

2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:09.120
 You know, they're just, when you learn something,

2:27:09.120 --> 2:27:10.920
 it's in the context of something else

2:27:10.920 --> 2:27:13.980
 and you can have faint, tiny little hints of things.

2:27:13.980 --> 2:27:16.440
 And I do think there are some deep things

2:27:16.440 --> 2:27:18.840
 around like sparse distributed memories and boosting.

2:27:18.840 --> 2:27:20.420
 That's like, if you can just be slightly

2:27:20.420 --> 2:27:23.360
 above the noise floor of having some hint of something,

2:27:23.360 --> 2:27:26.460
 you can have things refined into pulling the memory back up.

2:27:26.460 --> 2:27:29.560
 So having a, being a programmer and having a toolbox

2:27:29.560 --> 2:27:31.200
 of like all of these things that,

2:27:31.200 --> 2:27:33.640
 things that I did in all of these previous lives

2:27:33.640 --> 2:27:36.080
 of programming tasks that still matters to me

2:27:36.080 --> 2:27:38.520
 about how I'm able to pull up some of these things.

2:27:38.520 --> 2:27:41.180
 Like in that case, it was something I did on the Apple 2

2:27:41.180 --> 2:27:43.240
 then being relevant for the PC.

2:27:43.240 --> 2:27:46.040
 And I have still cases when I would,

2:27:46.040 --> 2:27:48.000
 when I would work on mobile development then be like,

2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:51.720
 okay, I did something like this back in the doom days,

2:27:51.720 --> 2:27:53.600
 but now it's a different environment,

2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:55.000
 but I have still had that tie.

2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:56.880
 I can bring it in and I can transform it

2:27:56.880 --> 2:27:59.120
 into what the world needs right now.

2:27:59.120 --> 2:28:01.920
 And I do think that's actually one of the very core things

2:28:01.920 --> 2:28:04.680
 with human cognition and brain like,

2:28:04.680 --> 2:28:06.080
 you know, brain like functioning

2:28:06.080 --> 2:28:08.480
 is finding these ways about you've got,

2:28:08.480 --> 2:28:10.800
 your brain is kind of everything everywhere all at once.

2:28:10.800 --> 2:28:13.080
 You know, it's, it is just a set of all of this stuff

2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:16.440
 that is just fetched back by these queries that go into it.

2:28:16.440 --> 2:28:18.900
 And they can just be slightly above the noise floor

2:28:18.900 --> 2:28:21.260
 with a random noise in your neurons and synapses

2:28:21.260 --> 2:28:23.980
 that are affecting exactly what gets pulled up.

2:28:23.980 --> 2:28:26.520
 So you're saying some of these very specific solutions

2:28:26.520 --> 2:28:28.600
 for different games,

2:28:28.600 --> 2:28:31.960
 you find that there's a kernel of a deep idea

2:28:31.960 --> 2:28:34.760
 that's generalizable to other, to other things.

2:28:34.760 --> 2:28:36.480
 Yeah, you can't predict what it's going to be,

2:28:36.480 --> 2:28:37.720
 but that idea of like,

2:28:37.720 --> 2:28:40.720
 I called out that compiled shaders in the forward

2:28:40.720 --> 2:28:43.320
 that I wrote for that, the game engine black book,

2:28:43.320 --> 2:28:44.920
 as you know, this is,

2:28:44.920 --> 2:28:48.000
 it's kind of an end point of unrolling code,

2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:50.400
 but that's one of those things that thinking about that

2:28:50.400 --> 2:28:51.640
 and having that in your mind.

2:28:51.640 --> 2:28:53.120
 And I'm sure there are some programmers

2:28:53.120 --> 2:28:54.680
 that, you know, hear about that.

2:28:54.680 --> 2:28:55.560
 Think about it a little bit.

2:28:55.560 --> 2:28:57.040
 It's kind of the mind blown moment.

2:28:57.040 --> 2:29:00.760
 It's like, oh, you can just turn all of that data into code.

2:29:00.760 --> 2:29:03.360
 And nowadays, you know, you have instruction cache issues

2:29:03.360 --> 2:29:05.540
 and that's not necessarily the best idea,

2:29:05.540 --> 2:29:07.280
 but there are different,

2:29:07.280 --> 2:29:09.020
 it's an idea that has power

2:29:09.020 --> 2:29:11.500
 and has probably relevance in some other areas.

2:29:11.500 --> 2:29:13.020
 Maybe it's in a hardware point of view

2:29:13.020 --> 2:29:15.460
 that there's a way you approach building hardware

2:29:15.460 --> 2:29:16.800
 that has that same,

2:29:16.800 --> 2:29:18.440
 you don't even have to think about iterating.

2:29:18.440 --> 2:29:22.200
 You just bake everything all the way into it in one place.

2:29:22.200 --> 2:29:25.400
 What is the story of how you came to program Doom?

2:29:25.400 --> 2:29:27.760
 What are some memorable technical challenges

2:29:27.760 --> 2:29:29.800
 or innovations within that game?

2:29:29.800 --> 2:29:33.640
 So the path that we went after Wolfenstein got out

2:29:33.640 --> 2:29:35.560
 and we were on this crazy arc

2:29:35.560 --> 2:29:38.840
 where Keen one through three, more success than we thought,

2:29:38.840 --> 2:29:41.120
 Keen four through six, even more success,

2:29:41.120 --> 2:29:42.880
 Wolfenstein even more success.

2:29:42.880 --> 2:29:46.420
 So we were on this crazy trajectory for things.

2:29:46.420 --> 2:29:48.280
 So actually our first box commercial project

2:29:48.280 --> 2:29:50.660
 was the Commander Keen game,

2:29:50.660 --> 2:29:52.960
 but then Wolfenstein was going to have a game called

2:29:52.960 --> 2:29:55.940
 Spear of Destiny, which was a commercial version,

2:29:55.940 --> 2:29:57.260
 60 new levels.

2:29:57.260 --> 2:29:59.480
 So the rest of the team took the game engine

2:29:59.480 --> 2:30:02.740
 pretty much as it was and started working on that.

2:30:02.740 --> 2:30:03.920
 We got new monsters,

2:30:03.920 --> 2:30:07.640
 but it's basically reskins of the things there.

2:30:07.640 --> 2:30:09.420
 And there's a really interesting aspect about that

2:30:09.420 --> 2:30:12.260
 that I didn't appreciate until much, much later

2:30:12.260 --> 2:30:16.640
 about how Wolfenstein clearly did tap out its limit

2:30:16.640 --> 2:30:18.840
 about what you want to play,

2:30:18.840 --> 2:30:21.600
 all the levels and a couple of our license things.

2:30:21.600 --> 2:30:24.000
 There was a hard creative wall

2:30:24.000 --> 2:30:25.800
 that you did not really benefit much

2:30:25.800 --> 2:30:27.880
 by continuing to beat on it.

2:30:27.880 --> 2:30:31.440
 But a game like Doom and other more modern games

2:30:31.440 --> 2:30:33.000
 like Minecraft or something,

2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:35.040
 there's kind of a Turing completeness level

2:30:35.040 --> 2:30:37.200
 of design freedom that you get in games

2:30:37.200 --> 2:30:40.400
 that Wolfenstein clearly sat on one side of.

2:30:40.400 --> 2:30:42.040
 All the creative people in the world

2:30:42.040 --> 2:30:43.980
 could not go and do a masterpiece

2:30:43.980 --> 2:30:46.480
 just with the technology that Wolfenstein had.

2:30:46.480 --> 2:30:48.160
 Wolfenstein could do Wolfenstein,

2:30:48.160 --> 2:30:50.760
 but you really couldn't do something crazy and different.

2:30:50.760 --> 2:30:53.380
 But it didn't take that much more capability

2:30:53.380 --> 2:30:56.240
 to get to Wolfenstein with the freeform lines

2:30:56.240 --> 2:30:58.600
 and a little bit more artistic freedom

2:30:58.600 --> 2:31:00.960
 to get to the point where people still announce

2:31:00.960 --> 2:31:03.720
 new Doom levels today, all these years after

2:31:03.720 --> 2:31:06.720
 without having completely tapped out the creativity.

2:31:06.720 --> 2:31:07.560
 How did you put it?

2:31:07.560 --> 2:31:08.520
 Turing complete?

2:31:08.520 --> 2:31:10.200
 Yeah, Turing complete design space.

2:31:10.200 --> 2:31:11.040
 Design space.

2:31:11.040 --> 2:31:11.880
 Where it's like, you know,

2:31:11.880 --> 2:31:14.800
 we have the kind of computational universality

2:31:14.800 --> 2:31:16.120
 on a lot of things and how different

2:31:16.120 --> 2:31:17.480
 subsurface work. For creativity.

2:31:17.480 --> 2:31:20.960
 But yeah, there's things where a box can be too small,

2:31:20.960 --> 2:31:22.840
 but above a certain point,

2:31:22.840 --> 2:31:26.200
 you kind of are at the point where you really have

2:31:26.200 --> 2:31:28.400
 almost unbounded creative ability there.

2:31:28.400 --> 2:31:31.440
 And Doom was the first time you crossed that line.

2:31:31.440 --> 2:31:35.100
 Yeah, where there were thousands of Doom levels created,

2:31:35.100 --> 2:31:37.320
 and some of them still have something new and interesting

2:31:37.320 --> 2:31:38.600
 to say to the world about it.

2:31:38.600 --> 2:31:43.220
 Is that line, can you introspect what that line was?

2:31:43.220 --> 2:31:44.840
 Is it in the design space?

2:31:44.840 --> 2:31:48.380
 Is it something about the programming capabilities

2:31:48.380 --> 2:31:50.920
 that you were able to add to the game?

2:31:50.920 --> 2:31:54.380
 So the graphics fidelity was a necessary part

2:31:54.380 --> 2:31:57.520
 because the block limitations in Wolfenstein,

2:31:57.520 --> 2:32:00.800
 what we had right there was not enough.

2:32:00.800 --> 2:32:04.680
 The full scale blocks, although Minecraft really did show

2:32:04.680 --> 2:32:07.760
 that perhaps blocks stacked in 3D

2:32:07.760 --> 2:32:09.920
 and at one quarter of the scale of that,

2:32:09.920 --> 2:32:11.360
 or one eighth in volume,

2:32:11.360 --> 2:32:13.260
 is then sufficient to have all of that.

2:32:13.260 --> 2:32:16.760
 But the wall sized blocks that we had in Wolfenstein

2:32:16.760 --> 2:32:18.720
 was too much of a creative limitation.

2:32:18.720 --> 2:32:21.640
 We licensed the technology to a few other teams.

2:32:21.640 --> 2:32:24.880
 None of them made too much of a dent with that.

2:32:24.880 --> 2:32:27.240
 It just wasn't enough creative ability.

2:32:27.240 --> 2:32:28.480
 But a little bit more,

2:32:28.480 --> 2:32:31.000
 whether it was the variable floors and ceilings

2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:33.200
 and arbitrary angles in Doom,

2:32:33.200 --> 2:32:37.200
 or the smaller voxel blocks in Minecraft,

2:32:37.200 --> 2:32:38.640
 is then enough to open it up

2:32:38.640 --> 2:32:41.880
 to just worlds and worlds of new capabilities.

2:32:41.880 --> 2:32:45.040
 What is binary space partitioning?

2:32:45.040 --> 2:32:47.600
 So the. Which is one of the technologies.

2:32:47.600 --> 2:32:51.080
 Yeah, so jump around a little bit on the story path there.

2:32:51.080 --> 2:32:53.160
 So while the team was working on Spirit Destiny

2:32:53.160 --> 2:32:57.200
 for Wolfenstein, we had met another development team,

2:32:57.200 --> 2:32:59.960
 Raven Software, while we were in Wisconsin.

2:32:59.960 --> 2:33:03.280
 And they were doing, they had RPG background

2:33:03.280 --> 2:33:04.760
 and I still kind of loved that.

2:33:04.760 --> 2:33:07.720
 And I offered to do a game engine for them

2:33:07.720 --> 2:33:10.720
 to let them do a 3D rendered RPG

2:33:10.720 --> 2:33:14.060
 instead of the, like most RPG games were kind of hand drawn.

2:33:14.060 --> 2:33:15.540
 They made it look kind of 3D,

2:33:15.540 --> 2:33:17.560
 but it was done just all with artist work

2:33:17.560 --> 2:33:19.800
 rather than a real engine.

2:33:19.800 --> 2:33:23.320
 And after Wolfenstein, this was still a tile based world,

2:33:23.320 --> 2:33:25.600
 but I added floors and ceilings and some lighting

2:33:25.600 --> 2:33:27.680
 and the ability to have some sloped floors

2:33:27.680 --> 2:33:28.520
 in different areas.

2:33:28.520 --> 2:33:30.040
 And that was my intermediate step

2:33:30.040 --> 2:33:32.360
 for a game called Shadowcaster.

2:33:32.360 --> 2:33:34.440
 And it had slowed down enough.

2:33:34.440 --> 2:33:37.680
 It was not fast enough to do our type of action things.

2:33:37.680 --> 2:33:39.960
 So they had the screen crop down a little bit.

2:33:39.960 --> 2:33:42.280
 So you couldn't go the full screen width

2:33:42.280 --> 2:33:46.320
 like we would try to do in Wolfenstein, but I learned a lot.

2:33:46.320 --> 2:33:47.960
 I got the floors and ceilings and lightings

2:33:47.960 --> 2:33:48.880
 and it looked great.

2:33:48.880 --> 2:33:50.360
 They were great artists up there.

2:33:50.360 --> 2:33:52.320
 And it was an inspiration for us

2:33:52.320 --> 2:33:54.400
 to look at some of that stuff.

2:33:54.400 --> 2:33:57.000
 But I had learned enough from that,

2:33:57.000 --> 2:33:58.480
 that I had the plan for,

2:33:58.480 --> 2:34:01.540
 I knew faster ways to do the lighting and shadowing.

2:34:01.540 --> 2:34:03.640
 And I wanted to do this free form geometry.

2:34:03.640 --> 2:34:06.560
 I wanted to break out of this tile based

2:34:06.560 --> 2:34:09.120
 90 degree world limitations.

2:34:09.120 --> 2:34:12.280
 So we had, that was when we got our next stations

2:34:12.280 --> 2:34:14.960
 and we were working with these higher powered systems.

2:34:14.960 --> 2:34:18.400
 And we built an editor that let us draw

2:34:18.400 --> 2:34:20.240
 kind of arbitrary line segments.

2:34:20.240 --> 2:34:22.720
 And I was working hard to try to make something

2:34:22.720 --> 2:34:24.820
 that could render this fast enough.

2:34:26.120 --> 2:34:28.760
 I was pushing myself pretty hard.

2:34:28.760 --> 2:34:32.220
 And we were at a point where we could see some things

2:34:32.220 --> 2:34:33.720
 that looked amazingly cool,

2:34:33.720 --> 2:34:37.760
 but it wasn't really fast enough for the way I was doing it.

2:34:37.760 --> 2:34:39.440
 For this flexibility, it was no longer,

2:34:39.440 --> 2:34:41.080
 I couldn't just ray cast into it.

2:34:41.080 --> 2:34:43.240
 And I had these very complex sets of lines

2:34:43.240 --> 2:34:45.360
 and simple little worlds were okay.

2:34:45.360 --> 2:34:47.520
 But the cool things that we wanted to do

2:34:47.520 --> 2:34:49.680
 just weren't quite fast enough.

2:34:49.680 --> 2:34:52.480
 And I wound up taking a break at that point.

2:34:52.480 --> 2:34:54.520
 And I did the port.

2:34:54.520 --> 2:34:58.000
 I did two ports of our games,

2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:01.040
 Wolfenstein to the Super Nintendo.

2:35:01.040 --> 2:35:04.240
 It was a crazy difficult thing to do,

2:35:04.240 --> 2:35:06.040
 which was an even slower processors,

2:35:06.040 --> 2:35:10.000
 like a couple of megahertz processor.

2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:11.820
 And it had been this whole thing

2:35:11.820 --> 2:35:16.820
 where we had farmed out the work and it wasn't going well.

2:35:17.160 --> 2:35:18.860
 And I took it back over

2:35:18.860 --> 2:35:21.860
 and trying to make it go fast on there

2:35:21.860 --> 2:35:25.160
 where it really did not have much processing power.

2:35:25.160 --> 2:35:26.880
 The pixels were stretched up hugely

2:35:26.880 --> 2:35:29.040
 and it was pretty ugly when you looked at it.

2:35:29.040 --> 2:35:31.520
 But in the end, it did come out fast enough to play

2:35:31.520 --> 2:35:33.480
 and still be kind of fun from that.

2:35:33.480 --> 2:35:36.600
 But that was where I started using BSP trees

2:35:36.600 --> 2:35:38.320
 or binary space partitioning trees.

2:35:38.320 --> 2:35:41.520
 It was one of those things I had to make it faster there.

2:35:41.520 --> 2:35:44.520
 It was a stepping stone where it was reasonably easy

2:35:44.520 --> 2:35:46.960
 to understand in the grid world of Wolfenstein

2:35:46.960 --> 2:35:49.960
 where it was all still 90 degree angles.

2:35:49.960 --> 2:35:53.920
 BSP trees were, I eased myself into it with that.

2:35:53.920 --> 2:35:56.200
 And it was a big success.

2:35:56.200 --> 2:35:58.740
 Then when I came back to working on Doom,

2:35:58.740 --> 2:36:00.640
 I had this new tool in my toolbox.

2:36:00.640 --> 2:36:02.040
 It was gonna be a lot harder

2:36:02.040 --> 2:36:03.900
 with the arbitrary angles of Doom.

2:36:03.900 --> 2:36:06.120
 This was where I really started grappling

2:36:06.120 --> 2:36:07.760
 with epsilon problems.

2:36:07.760 --> 2:36:09.600
 And just up until that point,

2:36:09.600 --> 2:36:11.360
 I hadn't really had to deal with the fact

2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:13.820
 that I am so many numeric things.

2:36:13.820 --> 2:36:15.340
 This almost felt like a betrayal to me

2:36:15.340 --> 2:36:17.600
 where people had told me that I had mathematicians

2:36:17.600 --> 2:36:20.360
 up on a bit of a pedestal where I was,

2:36:20.360 --> 2:36:22.680
 people think I'm a math wizard and I'm not.

2:36:22.680 --> 2:36:25.980
 I really, everything that I did was really done

2:36:25.980 --> 2:36:29.520
 with a solid high school math understanding.

2:36:29.520 --> 2:36:33.480
 Algebra two trigonometry and that was what got me

2:36:33.480 --> 2:36:35.500
 all the way through Doom and Quake and all of that,

2:36:35.500 --> 2:36:38.280
 of just understanding basics of matrices

2:36:38.280 --> 2:36:41.040
 and knowing it well enough to do something with it.

2:36:41.040 --> 2:36:42.920
 What's the epsilon problems you ran into?

2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:46.720
 So when you wind up taking like a sloped line

2:36:46.720 --> 2:36:48.340
 and you say, I'm going to intersect it

2:36:48.340 --> 2:36:49.880
 with another sloped line,

2:36:50.920 --> 2:36:52.200
 then you wind up with something

2:36:52.200 --> 2:36:54.960
 that's not going to be on these nice grid boundaries.

2:36:54.960 --> 2:36:57.120
 With the Wolfenstein tile maps,

2:36:57.120 --> 2:36:58.960
 all you've got is horizontal and vertical lines

2:36:58.960 --> 2:37:00.200
 looking at it from above.

2:37:00.200 --> 2:37:02.200
 And if you cut one of them, it's just obvious

2:37:02.200 --> 2:37:04.880
 the other one gets cut exactly at that point.

2:37:04.880 --> 2:37:06.620
 But when you have angled lines,

2:37:06.620 --> 2:37:08.840
 you're doing a kind of a slope intercept problem

2:37:08.840 --> 2:37:11.200
 and you wind up with rational numbers there

2:37:11.200 --> 2:37:14.800
 where things that are not going to evenly land on an integer

2:37:14.800 --> 2:37:17.240
 or even on any fixed point value that you've got.

2:37:17.240 --> 2:37:19.520
 So everything winds up having to snap

2:37:19.520 --> 2:37:20.960
 to some fixed point value.

2:37:20.960 --> 2:37:23.400
 So the lines slightly change their angle.

2:37:23.400 --> 2:37:25.320
 You wind up, if you cut something here,

2:37:25.320 --> 2:37:26.840
 this one's going to bend a little this way

2:37:26.840 --> 2:37:28.900
 and it's not going to be completely straight.

2:37:28.900 --> 2:37:30.720
 And then you come down to all these questions of,

2:37:30.720 --> 2:37:35.140
 well, this one is a point on an angled line.

2:37:35.140 --> 2:37:38.000
 You can't answer that in finite precision

2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:41.000
 unless you're doing something with actual rational numbers.

2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:43.220
 And later on, I did waste far too much time

2:37:43.220 --> 2:37:44.180
 chasing things like that.

2:37:44.180 --> 2:37:46.860
 How do you do precise arithmetic with rational numbers?

2:37:46.860 --> 2:37:49.940
 And it always blows up eventually, exponentially

2:37:49.940 --> 2:37:50.780
 as you do it.

2:37:50.780 --> 2:37:53.240
 So these kinds of things are impossible with computers.

2:37:53.240 --> 2:37:55.180
 So they're possible.

2:37:55.180 --> 2:37:57.460
 Again, there are paths to doing it,

2:37:57.460 --> 2:37:59.240
 but you can't fit them conveniently

2:37:59.240 --> 2:38:00.240
 in any of the numbers.

2:38:00.240 --> 2:38:01.800
 You need to start using big nums

2:38:01.800 --> 2:38:04.600
 and different factor trackings of different things.

2:38:04.600 --> 2:38:08.120
 So you have to, if you have any elements of OCD

2:38:08.120 --> 2:38:09.840
 and you want to do something perfectly,

2:38:09.840 --> 2:38:12.280
 you're screwed if you're working with floating point.

2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:13.120
 Yeah.

2:38:13.120 --> 2:38:15.320
 So you had to deal with this for the first time.

2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:18.400
 And there were lots of challenges there about like,

2:38:18.400 --> 2:38:20.080
 okay, they build this cool thing.

2:38:20.080 --> 2:38:22.880
 And the way the BSP trees work is it basically

2:38:22.880 --> 2:38:26.400
 takes the walls and it carves other walls by those walls

2:38:26.400 --> 2:38:28.760
 in this clever way that you can then

2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:30.440
 take all of these fragments.

2:38:30.440 --> 2:38:33.120
 And then you can for sure, from any given point,

2:38:33.120 --> 2:38:35.160
 get an ordering of everything in the world.

2:38:35.160 --> 2:38:36.800
 And you can say, this goes in front of this,

2:38:36.800 --> 2:38:40.200
 goes in front of this, all the way back to the last thing.

2:38:40.200 --> 2:38:42.400
 And that's super valuable for graphics

2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:45.280
 where kind of a classic graphics algorithm

2:38:45.280 --> 2:38:46.800
 would be painter's algorithm.

2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:48.200
 You paint the furthest thing first,

2:38:48.200 --> 2:38:49.880
 and then the next thing, and then the next thing,

2:38:49.880 --> 2:38:52.760
 and then it comes up and it's all perfect for you.

2:38:52.760 --> 2:38:54.840
 That's slow because you don't want to have to have drawn

2:38:54.840 --> 2:38:56.160
 everything like that,

2:38:56.160 --> 2:38:57.580
 but you can also flip it around

2:38:57.580 --> 2:38:59.680
 and draw the closest thing to you.

2:38:59.680 --> 2:39:01.400
 And then if you're clever about it,

2:39:01.400 --> 2:39:03.520
 you can figure out what you need to draw

2:39:03.520 --> 2:39:05.480
 that's visible beyond that.

2:39:05.480 --> 2:39:07.560
 And that's what BSP trees allow you to do.

2:39:07.560 --> 2:39:10.620
 Yeah, so it's combined with a bunch of other things,

2:39:10.620 --> 2:39:12.200
 but it gives you that ordering.

2:39:12.200 --> 2:39:13.760
 It's a clever way of doing things.

2:39:13.760 --> 2:39:15.520
 And I remember I had learned this

2:39:15.520 --> 2:39:18.760
 from one of my graphics Bible at the time,

2:39:18.760 --> 2:39:20.480
 a book called Foley and Van Damme.

2:39:20.480 --> 2:39:22.200
 And again, it was a different world back there.

2:39:22.200 --> 2:39:24.660
 There was a small integer number of books.

2:39:24.660 --> 2:39:29.660
 And this book that was big fat college textbook

2:39:29.680 --> 2:39:32.520
 that I had read through many times.

2:39:32.520 --> 2:39:34.240
 I didn't understand everything in it.

2:39:34.240 --> 2:39:35.840
 Some of it wasn't useful to me,

2:39:35.840 --> 2:39:39.620
 but they had the little thing about finite orderings

2:39:39.620 --> 2:39:41.520
 of you draw a little T shaped thing

2:39:41.520 --> 2:39:44.760
 and you can say you can make a fixed ahead of time order

2:39:44.760 --> 2:39:48.240
 from this and you can generalize this with the BSP trees.

2:39:48.240 --> 2:39:50.820
 And I got a little bit more information about that.

2:39:50.820 --> 2:39:53.120
 And it was kind of fun later while I was working on Quake,

2:39:53.120 --> 2:39:54.760
 I got to meet Bruce Naylor,

2:39:54.760 --> 2:39:56.520
 who is one of the original researchers

2:39:56.520 --> 2:40:00.840
 that developed those technologies for academic literature.

2:40:00.840 --> 2:40:01.740
 And that was kind of fun,

2:40:01.740 --> 2:40:03.800
 but I was very much just finding a tool

2:40:03.800 --> 2:40:05.840
 that can help me solve what I was doing.

2:40:05.840 --> 2:40:07.800
 And I was using it in this very crude way

2:40:07.800 --> 2:40:10.480
 in a two dimensional fashion, rather than the general 3D.

2:40:10.480 --> 2:40:12.040
 The Epsilon problems got much worse

2:40:12.040 --> 2:40:13.760
 in Quake and three dimensionals

2:40:13.760 --> 2:40:15.680
 when things angle in every way.

2:40:15.680 --> 2:40:18.360
 But eventually I did sort out

2:40:18.360 --> 2:40:20.000
 how to do it reliably on Doom.

2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:22.200
 There were still a few edge cases in Doom

2:40:22.200 --> 2:40:24.360
 that were not absolutely perfect

2:40:24.360 --> 2:40:27.740
 where they even got terminologies in the communities.

2:40:27.740 --> 2:40:29.440
 Like when you got to something where it was messed up,

2:40:29.440 --> 2:40:30.920
 it was a hall of mirrors effect

2:40:30.920 --> 2:40:33.720
 because you'd sweep by and it wouldn't draw something there.

2:40:33.720 --> 2:40:36.200
 And you would just wind up with the leftover remnants

2:40:36.200 --> 2:40:39.260
 as you flipped between the two pages.

2:40:39.260 --> 2:40:41.480
 But BSP trees were important for it.

2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:45.640
 But it's again worth noting that after we did Doom,

2:40:45.640 --> 2:40:49.000
 our major competition came from Ken Silverman

2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:51.780
 and his build engine, which was used for Duke Nukem 3D

2:40:51.780 --> 2:40:54.080
 and some of the other games for 3D Realms.

2:40:54.080 --> 2:40:56.200
 And he used a completely different technology,

2:40:56.200 --> 2:40:59.200
 nothing to do with BSP trees.

2:40:59.200 --> 2:41:03.880
 So there's not just a one true way of doing things.

2:41:03.880 --> 2:41:05.600
 There were critical things about

2:41:05.600 --> 2:41:07.160
 to make any of those games fast.

2:41:07.160 --> 2:41:09.640
 You had to separate your drawing into,

2:41:09.640 --> 2:41:12.440
 you drew vertical lines and you drew horizontal lines,

2:41:12.440 --> 2:41:14.320
 just kind of changing exactly

2:41:14.320 --> 2:41:15.760
 what you would draw with them.

2:41:15.760 --> 2:41:19.360
 That was critical for the technologies at that time.

2:41:19.360 --> 2:41:21.680
 And like all the games that were kind of like that

2:41:21.680 --> 2:41:23.400
 wound up doing something similar,

2:41:23.400 --> 2:41:25.400
 but there were still a bunch of other decisions

2:41:25.400 --> 2:41:26.800
 that could be made.

2:41:26.800 --> 2:41:30.360
 And we made good enough decisions on everything on Doom.

2:41:30.360 --> 2:41:33.680
 We brought in multiplayer significantly

2:41:33.680 --> 2:41:35.640
 and it was our first game that was designed

2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:37.640
 to be modified by the user community

2:41:37.640 --> 2:41:41.120
 where we had this whole setup of our WAD files and PWADs

2:41:41.120 --> 2:41:43.680
 and things that people could build with tools

2:41:43.680 --> 2:41:44.680
 that we released to them.

2:41:44.680 --> 2:41:46.220
 And they eventually rewrote to be better

2:41:46.220 --> 2:41:48.840
 than what we released, but they could build things

2:41:48.840 --> 2:41:50.400
 and you could add it to your game

2:41:50.400 --> 2:41:52.260
 without destructively modifying it,

2:41:52.260 --> 2:41:54.080
 which is what you had to do in all the early games.

2:41:54.080 --> 2:41:57.600
 You literally hacked the data files or the executable

2:41:57.600 --> 2:42:00.580
 before while Doom was set up in this flexible way

2:42:00.580 --> 2:42:02.300
 so that you could just say,

2:42:02.300 --> 2:42:04.820
 run the normal game with this added on on top

2:42:04.820 --> 2:42:06.920
 and it would overlay just the things

2:42:06.920 --> 2:42:09.100
 that you wanted to there.

2:42:09.100 --> 2:42:11.580
 Would you say that Doom was kind of the first

2:42:11.580 --> 2:42:14.240
 true 3D game that you created?

2:42:14.240 --> 2:42:16.620
 So no, it's still, Doom would usually be called

2:42:16.620 --> 2:42:17.800
 a two and a half D game

2:42:17.800 --> 2:42:20.300
 where it had three dimensional points on it.

2:42:20.300 --> 2:42:22.440
 And this is another one of these kind of pedantic things

2:42:22.440 --> 2:42:23.980
 that people love to argue about,

2:42:23.980 --> 2:42:25.720
 about what was the first 3D game.

2:42:25.720 --> 2:42:29.360
 I still, like every month probably I hear from somebody

2:42:29.360 --> 2:42:32.320
 about, well, was Doom really a 3D game or something?

2:42:34.320 --> 2:42:38.520
 And I give the point where characters had three coordinates.

2:42:38.520 --> 2:42:40.240
 So you had like an X, Y and Z,

2:42:40.240 --> 2:42:42.300
 the cacodamon could be coming in very high

2:42:42.300 --> 2:42:45.000
 and come down towards you.

2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:47.400
 The walls had three coordinates on them.

2:42:47.400 --> 2:42:50.320
 So on some sense it's a 3D game engine,

2:42:50.320 --> 2:42:53.440
 but it was not a fully general 3D game engine.

2:42:53.440 --> 2:42:56.660
 You could not build a pyramid in Doom

2:42:56.660 --> 2:42:59.420
 because you couldn't make a sloped wall,

2:42:59.420 --> 2:43:00.480
 which was slightly different

2:43:00.480 --> 2:43:02.280
 where in that previous shadow caster game,

2:43:02.280 --> 2:43:05.200
 I could have vertexes and have a sloped floor there,

2:43:05.200 --> 2:43:08.320
 but the changes that I made for Doom to get higher speed

2:43:08.320 --> 2:43:11.660
 and a different set of flexibility traded away that ability,

2:43:11.660 --> 2:43:13.400
 but you literally couldn't make that.

2:43:13.400 --> 2:43:17.880
 You could not, you could make different heights of passages,

2:43:17.880 --> 2:43:20.280
 but you could not make a bridge over another area.

2:43:20.280 --> 2:43:21.880
 You could not go over and above it.

2:43:21.880 --> 2:43:24.880
 So it still had some 2D limitations to it.

2:43:24.880 --> 2:43:26.020
 That's more about the building

2:43:26.020 --> 2:43:27.480
 versus the actual experience.

2:43:27.480 --> 2:43:29.120
 Cause the experience is.

2:43:29.120 --> 2:43:30.520
 It felt like things would come at you,

2:43:30.520 --> 2:43:32.440
 but again, you couldn't look up either.

2:43:32.440 --> 2:43:34.720
 I am, you know, you could only pitch.

2:43:34.720 --> 2:43:36.460
 It was four degrees of freedom

2:43:36.460 --> 2:43:38.400
 rather than six degrees of freedom.

2:43:38.400 --> 2:43:40.600
 You did not have the ability to tilt your head this way

2:43:40.600 --> 2:43:42.320
 or pitch up and down.

2:43:42.320 --> 2:43:44.480
 So that takes us to Quake.

2:43:44.480 --> 2:43:47.480
 What was the leap there?

2:43:47.480 --> 2:43:50.040
 What was some fascinating technical challenges

2:43:50.040 --> 2:43:52.180
 and there were a lot or not challenges,

2:43:52.180 --> 2:43:54.140
 but innovations that you've come up with.

2:43:54.140 --> 2:43:56.440
 So Quake was kind of the first thing

2:43:56.440 --> 2:43:59.520
 where I did have to kind of come face to face

2:43:59.520 --> 2:44:01.240
 with my limitations,

2:44:01.240 --> 2:44:02.280
 where it was the first thing

2:44:02.280 --> 2:44:05.660
 where I really did kind of give it my all

2:44:05.660 --> 2:44:08.400
 and still come up, you know, come up a little bit short

2:44:08.400 --> 2:44:11.920
 in terms of what and when I wanted to get it done.

2:44:11.920 --> 2:44:13.560
 And the company ran,

2:44:13.560 --> 2:44:16.760
 they had some serious stresses through the whole project

2:44:16.760 --> 2:44:19.680
 and we bit off a lot.

2:44:19.680 --> 2:44:21.440
 So the things that we set out to do

2:44:21.440 --> 2:44:24.640
 was it was going to be really a true 3D engine

2:44:24.640 --> 2:44:26.960
 where it could do six degree of freedom.

2:44:26.960 --> 2:44:29.680
 You could have all the viewpoints.

2:44:29.680 --> 2:44:31.480
 You could model anything.

2:44:31.480 --> 2:44:35.280
 It had a really remarkable new lighting model

2:44:35.280 --> 2:44:37.080
 with the surface caching and things.

2:44:37.080 --> 2:44:38.480
 That was one of those where it was starting

2:44:38.480 --> 2:44:40.740
 to do some things that they weren't doing

2:44:40.740 --> 2:44:43.600
 even on the very high end systems.

2:44:43.600 --> 2:44:46.920
 And it was going to be completely programmable

2:44:46.920 --> 2:44:48.200
 in the modding standpoint,

2:44:48.200 --> 2:44:49.800
 where the thing that you couldn't do in Doom,

2:44:49.800 --> 2:44:52.360
 you could replace almost all of the media,

2:44:52.360 --> 2:44:55.120
 but you couldn't really change the game.

2:44:55.120 --> 2:44:57.100
 There were still some people that were doing

2:44:57.100 --> 2:44:58.800
 the hex setting of the executable,

2:44:58.800 --> 2:45:00.620
 the dehacked things where you could change

2:45:00.620 --> 2:45:01.900
 a few things about rules

2:45:01.900 --> 2:45:04.620
 and people made some early capture the flag type things

2:45:04.620 --> 2:45:06.020
 by hacking the executable,

2:45:06.020 --> 2:45:08.520
 but it wasn't really set out to do that.

2:45:08.520 --> 2:45:11.360
 Quake was going to have its own programming language

2:45:11.360 --> 2:45:13.200
 that the game was going to be implemented in it.

2:45:13.200 --> 2:45:14.840
 And that would be able to be overwritten

2:45:14.840 --> 2:45:16.560
 just like any of the media.

2:45:16.560 --> 2:45:18.400
 Code was going to be data for that.

2:45:18.400 --> 2:45:21.000
 And you would be able to have expansion packs

2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:24.160
 that changed fundamental things and mods and so on.

2:45:24.160 --> 2:45:27.120
 And the multiplayer was going to be playable

2:45:27.120 --> 2:45:28.120
 over the internet.

2:45:28.120 --> 2:45:30.880
 It was going to support a client server

2:45:30.880 --> 2:45:32.400
 rather than peer to peer.

2:45:32.400 --> 2:45:34.160
 So we had the possibility of supporting

2:45:34.160 --> 2:45:37.440
 larger numbers of players in disparate locations

2:45:37.440 --> 2:45:41.320
 with this full flexibility of the programming overrides

2:45:41.320 --> 2:45:44.920
 with full six degree of freedom modeling and viewing.

2:45:44.920 --> 2:45:47.960
 And with this fancy new light mapped

2:45:47.960 --> 2:45:49.720
 kind of surface caching side.

2:45:49.720 --> 2:45:50.640
 It was a lot.

2:45:50.640 --> 2:45:52.520
 And this was one of those things that

2:45:52.520 --> 2:45:56.000
 if I could go back and tell younger me

2:45:56.000 --> 2:45:57.500
 to do something differently,

2:45:57.500 --> 2:45:59.680
 it would have been to split those innovations up

2:45:59.680 --> 2:46:02.000
 into two phases in two separate games.

2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:03.640
 It will be phase one and phase two.

2:46:03.640 --> 2:46:05.480
 So it probably would have been taking

2:46:05.480 --> 2:46:08.600
 the Doom rendering engine and bringing in

2:46:08.600 --> 2:46:10.720
 the TCP IP client server.

2:46:10.720 --> 2:46:12.200
 Focusing on the multiplayer.

2:46:12.200 --> 2:46:15.240
 And the Quake C or would have been Doom C

2:46:15.240 --> 2:46:16.920
 programming language there.

2:46:16.920 --> 2:46:19.360
 So I would have split that into programming language

2:46:19.360 --> 2:46:21.800
 and networking with the same Doom engine

2:46:21.800 --> 2:46:24.000
 rather than forcing everybody to go towards

2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:27.640
 the Quake engine, which really meant getting a Pentium.

2:46:27.640 --> 2:46:31.000
 While it ran on a 486, it was not a great experience there.

2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:33.000
 We could have made more people happier

2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:37.320
 and gotten two games done in 50% more time.

2:46:37.320 --> 2:46:41.640
 So speaking of people happier, our mutual friend,

2:46:41.640 --> 2:46:46.320
 Joe Rogan, it seems like the most important moment

2:46:46.320 --> 2:46:49.480
 of his life is centered around Quake.

2:46:49.480 --> 2:46:53.520
 So it was a definitive part of his life.

2:46:53.520 --> 2:46:58.220
 So would he agree with your thinking that they should split?

2:46:59.120 --> 2:47:01.440
 So he is a person who loves Quake

2:47:01.440 --> 2:47:03.320
 and played Quake a lot.

2:47:03.320 --> 2:47:06.760
 Would he agree that you should have done the Doom engine

2:47:06.760 --> 2:47:09.680
 and focus on the multiplayer for phase one?

2:47:09.680 --> 2:47:14.680
 Or in your looking back, is the 3D world

2:47:14.800 --> 2:47:17.640
 that Quake created was also fundamental

2:47:17.640 --> 2:47:19.560
 to the enriching experience?

2:47:19.560 --> 2:47:21.560
 You know, I would say that what would have happened

2:47:21.560 --> 2:47:25.280
 is you would have had a Doom looking

2:47:25.280 --> 2:47:29.960
 but Quake feeling game eight months earlier

2:47:29.960 --> 2:47:33.120
 and then maybe six months after Quake actually shipped,

2:47:33.120 --> 2:47:36.380
 then there would have been the full running on a Pentium,

2:47:36.380 --> 2:47:38.720
 six degree of freedom graphics engine type things there.

2:47:38.720 --> 2:47:42.040
 So it's not that it wouldn't have been there.

2:47:42.040 --> 2:47:45.000
 It would have been something amazingly cool earlier

2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:47.740
 and then something even cooler somewhat later

2:47:47.740 --> 2:47:50.320
 where I would much rather have gone

2:47:50.320 --> 2:47:53.200
 and done two one year development efforts.

2:47:53.200 --> 2:47:54.800
 I've cycled them through.

2:47:54.800 --> 2:47:57.460
 I've been a little more pragmatic about that

2:47:57.460 --> 2:48:00.280
 rather than killing us ourselves on the whole Quake

2:48:00.280 --> 2:48:01.120
 development.

2:48:01.120 --> 2:48:04.100
 But I would say it's obviously things worked out well

2:48:04.100 --> 2:48:06.440
 in the end, but looking back and saying,

2:48:06.440 --> 2:48:08.960
 how would I optimize and do things differently?

2:48:08.960 --> 2:48:13.160
 That did seem to be a clear case where I going ahead

2:48:13.160 --> 2:48:15.840
 and we had enormous momentum on Doom.

2:48:15.840 --> 2:48:19.120
 We did Doom two as the kind of commercial boxed version

2:48:19.120 --> 2:48:22.140
 after our shareware success with the original,

2:48:22.140 --> 2:48:25.720
 but we could have just made another Doom game

2:48:25.720 --> 2:48:27.640
 adding those new features in.

2:48:27.640 --> 2:48:28.640
 It would have been huge.

2:48:28.640 --> 2:48:31.440
 We would have learned all the same lessons, but faster.

2:48:31.440 --> 2:48:34.120
 And it would have given six degree of freedom

2:48:34.120 --> 2:48:37.020
 and Pentium class systems a little bit more time

2:48:37.020 --> 2:48:40.080
 to get mainstream because we did cut out a lot of people

2:48:40.080 --> 2:48:42.880
 with the hardware requirements for Quake.

2:48:42.880 --> 2:48:44.800
 Was there any dark moments for you personally,

2:48:44.800 --> 2:48:49.800
 psychologically in having such harsh deadlines

2:48:51.080 --> 2:48:54.680
 and having to solve so many difficult technical challenges?

2:48:54.680 --> 2:48:59.680
 So I've never really had really dark black places.

2:49:00.660 --> 2:49:02.660
 I mean, I can't necessarily put myself

2:49:02.660 --> 2:49:03.940
 in anyone else's shoes,

2:49:03.940 --> 2:49:08.940
 but I understand a lot of people have significant challenges

2:49:09.560 --> 2:49:12.460
 with kind of their mental health and wellbeing.

2:49:12.460 --> 2:49:15.000
 And I've been super stressed.

2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:18.720
 I've been unhappy as a teenager in various ways,

2:49:18.720 --> 2:49:23.660
 but I've never really gone to a very dark place.

2:49:23.660 --> 2:49:28.660
 I just seem to be largely immune to what really wrecks people.

2:49:29.800 --> 2:49:32.260
 I mean, I've had plenty of time when I'm very unhappy

2:49:32.260 --> 2:49:33.860
 and miserable about something,

2:49:33.860 --> 2:49:36.380
 but it's never hit me like,

2:49:36.380 --> 2:49:38.740
 I believe it winds up hitting some other people.

2:49:38.740 --> 2:49:41.660
 I've borne up well under whatever stresses

2:49:41.660 --> 2:49:44.340
 have kind of fallen on me.

2:49:44.340 --> 2:49:46.900
 And I've always coped best on that

2:49:46.900 --> 2:49:49.460
 when all I need to do is usually

2:49:49.460 --> 2:49:51.180
 just kind of bear down on my work.

2:49:51.180 --> 2:49:55.060
 I pull myself out of whatever hole I might be slipping into

2:49:55.060 --> 2:49:57.300
 by actually making progress.

2:49:57.300 --> 2:49:59.460
 I mean, maybe if I was in a position

2:49:59.460 --> 2:50:01.740
 where I was never able to make that progress,

2:50:01.740 --> 2:50:03.300
 I could have slid down further,

2:50:03.300 --> 2:50:06.220
 but I've always been in a place where,

2:50:06.220 --> 2:50:07.540
 okay, a little bit more work,

2:50:07.540 --> 2:50:09.080
 maybe I'm in a tough spot here,

2:50:09.080 --> 2:50:12.240
 but I always know if I just keep pushing,

2:50:12.240 --> 2:50:14.640
 eventually I break through and I make progress,

2:50:14.640 --> 2:50:16.420
 I feel good about what I'm doing.

2:50:17.460 --> 2:50:20.660
 And that's been enough for me so far in my life.

2:50:20.660 --> 2:50:22.500
 Have you seen it in the distance,

2:50:23.700 --> 2:50:28.700
 like ideas of depression or contemplating suicide?

2:50:28.740 --> 2:50:30.500
 Have you seen those things far?

2:50:30.500 --> 2:50:33.100
 So what was interesting, when I was a teenager,

2:50:33.100 --> 2:50:37.300
 I was probably on some level a troubled youth.

2:50:37.300 --> 2:50:40.740
 I was unhappy most of my teenage years.

2:50:40.740 --> 2:50:42.580
 I really, I wanted to be on my own

2:50:42.580 --> 2:50:44.540
 doing programming all the time.

2:50:44.540 --> 2:50:47.620
 As soon as I was 18, 19, even though I was poor,

2:50:47.620 --> 2:50:50.700
 I was doing exactly what I wanted and I was very happy,

2:50:50.700 --> 2:50:53.020
 but high school was not a great time for me.

2:50:53.020 --> 2:50:56.920
 And I had a conversation with like the school counselor

2:50:56.920 --> 2:50:58.540
 and they're kind of running their script.

2:50:58.540 --> 2:51:00.580
 It's like, okay, it's kind of a weird kid here.

2:51:00.580 --> 2:51:02.380
 Let's carefully probe around.

2:51:02.380 --> 2:51:05.700
 It's like, do you ever think about ending it all?

2:51:05.700 --> 2:51:07.500
 I'm like, no, of course not.

2:51:07.500 --> 2:51:08.980
 Never, not at all.

2:51:08.980 --> 2:51:11.420
 This is temporary, things are going to be better.

2:51:13.140 --> 2:51:15.580
 And that's always been kind of the case for me.

2:51:15.580 --> 2:51:18.300
 And obviously that's not that way for everyone

2:51:18.300 --> 2:51:20.900
 and other people do react differently.

2:51:20.900 --> 2:51:24.940
 What was your escape from the troubled youth,

2:51:24.940 --> 2:51:29.940
 like music, video games, books?

2:51:33.660 --> 2:51:35.460
 How did you escape from a world

2:51:35.460 --> 2:51:38.180
 that's full of cruelty and suffering and that's absurd?

2:51:38.180 --> 2:51:41.800
 Yeah, I mean, I was not a victim of cruelty and suffering.

2:51:41.800 --> 2:51:44.340
 It's like, I was an unhappy, somewhat petulant youth

2:51:44.340 --> 2:51:48.260
 in my point where I'm not putting myself up

2:51:48.260 --> 2:51:49.700
 with anybody else's suffering,

2:51:49.700 --> 2:51:52.260
 but I was unhappy objectively.

2:51:52.260 --> 2:51:54.820
 And the things that I did

2:51:54.820 --> 2:51:57.260
 that very much characterized my childhood

2:51:57.260 --> 2:52:00.460
 were I had books, comic books,

2:52:00.460 --> 2:52:03.740
 Dungeons and Dragons, arcade games, video games.

2:52:03.740 --> 2:52:06.380
 Like some of my fondest childhood memories

2:52:06.380 --> 2:52:08.900
 are the convenience stores, the 711s and Quick Trips,

2:52:08.900 --> 2:52:11.380
 because they had a spinner rack of comic books

2:52:11.380 --> 2:52:12.700
 and they had a little side room

2:52:12.700 --> 2:52:15.780
 with two or three video games, arcade games in it.

2:52:15.780 --> 2:52:18.780
 And that was very much my happy place.

2:52:18.780 --> 2:52:20.820
 If I could, I get my comic books

2:52:20.820 --> 2:52:22.580
 and if I could go to a library

2:52:22.580 --> 2:52:25.740
 and go through those little zero, zero, zero section

2:52:25.740 --> 2:52:27.380
 where computer books were supposed to be.

2:52:27.380 --> 2:52:28.980
 And there were a few sad little books there,

2:52:28.980 --> 2:52:31.860
 but still just being able to sit down and go through that.

2:52:31.860 --> 2:52:35.740
 And I read a ridiculous number of books,

2:52:35.740 --> 2:52:38.620
 both fiction and nonfiction as a teenager.

2:52:38.620 --> 2:52:42.780
 And my rebelling in high school

2:52:42.780 --> 2:52:44.500
 was just sitting there with my nose in a book,

2:52:44.500 --> 2:52:46.820
 ignoring the class through lots of it.

2:52:46.820 --> 2:52:49.420
 And teachers had a range of reactions to that,

2:52:49.420 --> 2:52:52.340
 some more accepting of it than others.

2:52:53.580 --> 2:52:54.580
 I'm with you on that.

2:52:54.580 --> 2:52:56.540
 So let us return to Quake for a bit

2:52:56.540 --> 2:52:57.860
 with the technical challenges.

2:52:57.860 --> 2:53:02.860
 What everything together from the networking

2:53:03.460 --> 2:53:07.180
 to the graphics, what are some things you remember

2:53:07.180 --> 2:53:10.460
 that were innovations you had to come up with

2:53:10.460 --> 2:53:12.380
 in order to make it all happen?

2:53:12.380 --> 2:53:14.860
 Yeah, so there were a bunch of things on Quake

2:53:14.860 --> 2:53:16.380
 where on the one hand,

2:53:16.380 --> 2:53:19.260
 the idea that I built my own programming language

2:53:19.260 --> 2:53:20.940
 to implement the game in.

2:53:20.940 --> 2:53:22.900
 Looking back, and I try to tell people,

2:53:22.900 --> 2:53:25.460
 it's like every high level programmer

2:53:25.460 --> 2:53:26.860
 sometime in their career goes through

2:53:26.860 --> 2:53:28.020
 and they invent their own language.

2:53:28.020 --> 2:53:30.380
 It just seems to be a thing that's pretty broadly done.

2:53:30.380 --> 2:53:31.220
 People will be like,

2:53:31.220 --> 2:53:33.220
 I'm gonna go write a computer programming language.

2:53:33.220 --> 2:53:37.100
 And I don't regret having done it,

2:53:37.100 --> 2:53:40.100
 but after that, I switched from Quake C,

2:53:40.100 --> 2:53:43.060
 my quirky little pseudo object oriented

2:53:43.060 --> 2:53:45.300
 or entity oriented language there.

2:53:45.300 --> 2:53:47.900
 Quake two went back to using DLLs with C

2:53:47.900 --> 2:53:48.900
 and then Quake three,

2:53:48.900 --> 2:53:51.340
 I implemented my own C interpreter or compiler,

2:53:51.340 --> 2:53:53.180
 which was a much smarter thing to do

2:53:53.180 --> 2:53:55.780
 that I should have done originally for Quake.

2:53:55.780 --> 2:53:57.820
 But building my own language was an experience.

2:53:57.820 --> 2:53:59.660
 I learned a lot from that.

2:53:59.660 --> 2:54:02.260
 And then there was a generation of game programmers

2:54:02.260 --> 2:54:04.260
 that learned programming with Quake C,

2:54:04.260 --> 2:54:05.660
 which I feel kind of bad about,

2:54:05.660 --> 2:54:08.660
 because we give JavaScript a lot of crap,

2:54:08.660 --> 2:54:13.060
 but Quake C was nothing to write home about there.

2:54:13.060 --> 2:54:15.700
 But it allowed people to do magical things.

2:54:15.700 --> 2:54:16.780
 You get into programming,

2:54:16.780 --> 2:54:21.300
 not because you love the BNF syntax of a language,

2:54:21.300 --> 2:54:23.340
 it's because the language lets you do something

2:54:23.340 --> 2:54:24.460
 that you cared about.

2:54:24.460 --> 2:54:25.620
 And here's very much,

2:54:25.620 --> 2:54:26.980
 you could do something

2:54:26.980 --> 2:54:29.540
 in a whole beautiful three dimensional world.

2:54:29.540 --> 2:54:31.220
 And the idea and the fact that the code

2:54:31.220 --> 2:54:32.260
 for the game was out there,

2:54:32.260 --> 2:54:34.500
 you could say, I liked the shotgun,

2:54:34.500 --> 2:54:36.060
 but I want it to be more bad ass.

2:54:36.060 --> 2:54:37.180
 You go in there and say,

2:54:37.180 --> 2:54:39.220
 okay, now it does 200 points damage.

2:54:39.220 --> 2:54:41.500
 And then you go around with a big grin on your face,

2:54:41.500 --> 2:54:43.940
 blowing up monsters all over the game.

2:54:43.940 --> 2:54:48.220
 So yeah, it is not what I would do today

2:54:48.220 --> 2:54:49.540
 going back with that language,

2:54:49.540 --> 2:54:51.260
 but that was a big part of it.

2:54:51.260 --> 2:54:54.060
 Learning about the networking stuff,

2:54:54.060 --> 2:54:56.820
 because it's interesting where I learned these things

2:54:56.820 --> 2:54:57.660
 by reading books.

2:54:57.660 --> 2:55:00.100
 So I would get a book on networking and find something,

2:55:00.100 --> 2:55:02.700
 I read all about it and learn, okay, packets,

2:55:02.700 --> 2:55:06.380
 they can be out of order or lost or duplicated.

2:55:06.380 --> 2:55:07.220
 These are all the things

2:55:07.220 --> 2:55:09.300
 that can theoretically happen to packets.

2:55:09.300 --> 2:55:11.420
 So I wind up spending all this time thinking about

2:55:11.420 --> 2:55:13.100
 how do we deal about all of that?

2:55:13.100 --> 2:55:15.100
 And it turns out, of course, in the real world,

2:55:15.100 --> 2:55:16.020
 those are things that yes,

2:55:16.020 --> 2:55:18.100
 theoretically can happen with multiple routes,

2:55:18.100 --> 2:55:22.100
 but they really aren't things that your 99.999%

2:55:22.100 --> 2:55:24.020
 of your packets have to deal with.

2:55:25.100 --> 2:55:28.300
 So there was learning experiences about lots of that.

2:55:28.300 --> 2:55:32.060
 Like why, when TCP is appropriate versus UDP

2:55:32.060 --> 2:55:34.140
 and how if you do things in UDP,

2:55:34.140 --> 2:55:37.900
 you wind up reinventing TCP badly in almost all cases.

2:55:37.900 --> 2:55:41.540
 So there's good arguments for using both

2:55:41.540 --> 2:55:42.780
 for different game technology,

2:55:42.780 --> 2:55:44.380
 different parts of the game process,

2:55:44.380 --> 2:55:46.700
 transitioning from level to level and all.

2:55:46.700 --> 2:55:49.340
 But the graphics were the showcase

2:55:49.340 --> 2:55:51.900
 of what Quake was all about.

2:55:51.900 --> 2:55:55.500
 It was this graphics technology that nobody had seen there.

2:55:55.500 --> 2:55:57.420
 And it was a while before

2:55:57.420 --> 2:55:59.540
 there were competitive things out there.

2:55:59.540 --> 2:56:03.580
 And it went a long time internally really not working

2:56:03.580 --> 2:56:05.580
 where we were even building levels

2:56:05.580 --> 2:56:09.620
 where the game just was not at all shippable

2:56:09.620 --> 2:56:11.220
 with large fractions of the world,

2:56:11.220 --> 2:56:14.020
 like disappearing, not being there,

2:56:14.020 --> 2:56:16.860
 or being really slow in various parts of it.

2:56:16.860 --> 2:56:18.300
 And it was this act of faith.

2:56:18.300 --> 2:56:20.660
 It's like, I think I'm gonna be able to fix this.

2:56:20.660 --> 2:56:22.820
 I think I'm gonna be able to make this work.

2:56:23.700 --> 2:56:25.660
 And lots of stuff changed

2:56:25.660 --> 2:56:27.900
 where the level designers would build something

2:56:27.900 --> 2:56:29.980
 and then have to throw it away as something fundamental

2:56:29.980 --> 2:56:33.780
 and the kind of graphics or level technology changed.

2:56:33.780 --> 2:56:37.180
 And so there were two big things

2:56:37.180 --> 2:56:41.300
 that contributed to making it possible at that timeframe.

2:56:41.300 --> 2:56:42.300
 Two new things.

2:56:42.300 --> 2:56:43.660
 There was certainly

2:56:43.660 --> 2:56:46.060
 hardcore optimized low level assembly language.

2:56:46.060 --> 2:56:48.620
 And this was where I had hired Michael Abrash

2:56:48.620 --> 2:56:50.260
 away from Microsoft.

2:56:50.260 --> 2:56:52.340
 And he had been one of my early inspirations

2:56:52.340 --> 2:56:54.700
 where back in the soft disk days,

2:56:54.700 --> 2:56:57.300
 the library of magazines that they had,

2:56:57.300 --> 2:56:58.820
 some of my most treasured ones

2:56:58.820 --> 2:57:02.380
 were Michael Abrash's articles in Dr. Dobbs journal.

2:57:02.380 --> 2:57:06.380
 And it was amazing after all of our success in Doom,

2:57:06.380 --> 2:57:08.020
 we were able to kind of hit him up and say,

2:57:08.020 --> 2:57:10.540
 hey, we'd like you to come work at id Software.

2:57:10.540 --> 2:57:13.140
 And he was in the senior technical role at Microsoft.

2:57:13.140 --> 2:57:15.860
 And he was on track for,

2:57:15.860 --> 2:57:18.260
 and this was right when Microsoft was starting to take off.

2:57:18.260 --> 2:57:21.620
 And I did eventually convince him

2:57:21.620 --> 2:57:22.740
 that what we were doing

2:57:22.740 --> 2:57:24.540
 was gonna be really amazing with Quake.

2:57:24.540 --> 2:57:28.260
 It was gonna be something nobody had seen before.

2:57:28.260 --> 2:57:31.420
 It had these aspects of what we were talking about.

2:57:31.420 --> 2:57:33.580
 We had metaverse talk back then.

2:57:33.580 --> 2:57:36.660
 We had read Snow Crash and we knew about this.

2:57:36.660 --> 2:57:40.140
 And Michael was big into the science fiction

2:57:40.140 --> 2:57:41.420
 and we would talk about all that

2:57:41.420 --> 2:57:42.860
 and kind of spin this tale.

2:57:42.860 --> 2:57:45.140
 And it was some of the same conversations

2:57:45.140 --> 2:57:46.860
 that we have today about the metaverse,

2:57:46.860 --> 2:57:48.900
 about how you could have different areas

2:57:48.900 --> 2:57:50.300
 linked together by portals

2:57:50.300 --> 2:57:52.340
 and you could have user generated content

2:57:52.340 --> 2:57:54.380
 and changing out all of these things.

2:57:54.380 --> 2:57:56.900
 So you really were creating the metaverse with Quake.

2:57:56.900 --> 2:57:58.740
 And we talked about things like,

2:57:58.740 --> 2:58:02.780
 Duke used to be advertised as a virtual reality experience.

2:58:02.780 --> 2:58:05.220
 That was the first wave of virtual reality

2:58:05.220 --> 2:58:07.620
 was in the late 80s and early 90s,

2:58:07.620 --> 2:58:10.580
 you had like the Lawn Mower Man movie

2:58:10.580 --> 2:58:12.100
 and you had time in Newsweek

2:58:12.100 --> 2:58:14.580
 talking about the early VPL headsets.

2:58:14.580 --> 2:58:16.780
 And of course that cratered so hard

2:58:16.780 --> 2:58:18.660
 that people didn't wanna look at virtual reality

2:58:18.660 --> 2:58:20.140
 for decades afterwards,

2:58:20.140 --> 2:58:23.220
 where it was just, it was smoke and mirrors.

2:58:23.220 --> 2:58:24.820
 It was not real in the sense

2:58:24.820 --> 2:58:26.700
 that you could actually do something

2:58:26.700 --> 2:58:28.580
 real and valuable with it.

2:58:28.580 --> 2:58:32.220
 But still we had that kind of common set of talking points.

2:58:32.220 --> 2:58:36.340
 And we were talking about what these games could become

2:58:36.340 --> 2:58:37.900
 and how you'd like to see people

2:58:37.900 --> 2:58:39.580
 building all of these creative things.

2:58:39.580 --> 2:58:41.460
 Because we were seeing an explosion of work

2:58:41.460 --> 2:58:42.620
 with Doom at that time,

2:58:42.620 --> 2:58:45.700
 where people were doing amazingly cool things.

2:58:45.700 --> 2:58:48.100
 Like we saw cooler levels that we had built

2:58:48.100 --> 2:58:49.740
 coming out of the user community.

2:58:49.740 --> 2:58:51.420
 And then people finding ways

2:58:51.420 --> 2:58:54.060
 to change the characters in different ways.

2:58:54.060 --> 2:58:54.900
 And it was great.

2:58:54.900 --> 2:58:56.700
 And we knew what we were doing in Quake

2:58:56.700 --> 2:58:58.860
 was removing those last things.

2:58:58.860 --> 2:59:00.380
 There was some quirky things

2:59:00.380 --> 2:59:01.980
 with a couple of the data types

2:59:01.980 --> 2:59:03.900
 that didn't work right for overriding.

2:59:03.900 --> 2:59:07.380
 And then the core thing about the programming model.

2:59:07.380 --> 2:59:10.900
 And I was definitely going to hit all of those in Quake.

2:59:10.900 --> 2:59:15.540
 But the graphics side of it was still,

2:59:15.540 --> 2:59:17.060
 I knew what I wanted to do.

2:59:17.060 --> 2:59:20.460
 And it was one of these hubris things

2:59:20.460 --> 2:59:21.980
 where it's like, well, so far I've been able

2:59:21.980 --> 2:59:26.580
 to kind of kick everything that I set out to go do.

2:59:26.580 --> 2:59:29.380
 But Quake was definitely a little bit more

2:59:29.380 --> 2:59:32.180
 than could be comfortably chewed at that point.

2:59:32.180 --> 2:59:36.860
 And, but Michael was one of the strongest programmers

2:59:36.860 --> 2:59:39.140
 and graphics programmers that I knew.

2:59:39.140 --> 2:59:40.860
 And he was one of the people that I trusted

2:59:40.860 --> 2:59:44.260
 to write assembly code better than I could.

2:59:44.260 --> 2:59:46.740
 And there's a few people that I can point to

2:59:46.740 --> 2:59:49.940
 about things like this where I'm a world class optimizer.

2:59:49.940 --> 2:59:51.740
 I mean, I make things go fast,

2:59:51.740 --> 2:59:54.660
 but I recognize there's a number of people

2:59:54.660 --> 2:59:56.860
 that can write tighter assembly code,

2:59:56.860 --> 2:59:59.380
 tighter SIMD code or tighter CUDA code

2:59:59.380 --> 3:00:01.060
 than I can write.

3:00:02.140 --> 3:00:05.340
 My best strengths are a little bit more at the system level.

3:00:05.340 --> 3:00:07.020
 I mean, I'm good at all of that,

3:00:07.020 --> 3:00:10.260
 but the most leverage comes from making the decisions

3:00:10.260 --> 3:00:11.620
 that are a little bit higher up

3:00:11.620 --> 3:00:15.220
 where you figure out how to change your large scale problems

3:00:15.220 --> 3:00:18.020
 so that these lower level problems are easier to do

3:00:18.020 --> 3:00:23.020
 or it makes it possible to do them in a uniquely fast way.

3:00:23.380 --> 3:00:27.100
 So most of my big wins in a lot of ways

3:00:27.100 --> 3:00:30.300
 from all the way from the early games through VR

3:00:30.300 --> 3:00:33.020
 and the aerospace work that I'm doing or did,

3:00:33.020 --> 3:00:35.420
 and hopefully the AI work that I'm working on now

3:00:35.420 --> 3:00:37.620
 is finding an angle on something

3:00:37.620 --> 3:00:40.340
 that means you trade off something

3:00:40.340 --> 3:00:41.540
 that you maybe think you need,

3:00:41.540 --> 3:00:43.060
 but it turns out you don't need.

3:00:43.060 --> 3:00:45.860
 And by making a sacrifice in one place,

3:00:45.860 --> 3:00:48.820
 you can get big advantages in another place.

3:00:48.820 --> 3:00:51.660
 Is it clear at which level of the system

3:00:51.660 --> 3:00:54.300
 those big advantages can be gained?

3:00:54.300 --> 3:00:55.580
 It's not always clear.

3:00:55.580 --> 3:00:58.300
 And that's why the thing that I try

3:00:58.300 --> 3:01:00.140
 to make one of my core values,

3:01:00.140 --> 3:01:02.740
 and I proselytize to a lot of people

3:01:02.740 --> 3:01:05.500
 is trying to know the entire stack,

3:01:05.500 --> 3:01:08.140
 trying to see through everything that happens.

3:01:08.140 --> 3:01:09.580
 And it's almost impossible

3:01:09.580 --> 3:01:11.860
 on like the web browser level of things

3:01:11.860 --> 3:01:13.460
 where there's so many levels to it,

3:01:13.460 --> 3:01:15.820
 but you should at least understand what they all are,

3:01:15.820 --> 3:01:16.980
 even if you can't understand

3:01:16.980 --> 3:01:20.020
 all the performance characteristics at each level,

3:01:20.020 --> 3:01:22.980
 but it goes all the way down to literally the hardware.

3:01:22.980 --> 3:01:26.540
 So what is this chip capable of?

3:01:26.540 --> 3:01:29.380
 And what is this software that you're writing capable of?

3:01:29.380 --> 3:01:31.740
 And then with this architecture you put on top of that,

3:01:31.740 --> 3:01:33.300
 then the ecosystem around it,

3:01:33.300 --> 3:01:35.940
 all the people that are working on it.

3:01:35.940 --> 3:01:38.500
 So there are all these decisions

3:01:38.500 --> 3:01:41.220
 and they're never made in a globally optimal way,

3:01:41.220 --> 3:01:43.420
 but sometimes you can drive a thread

3:01:43.420 --> 3:01:45.100
 of global optimality through it.

3:01:45.100 --> 3:01:47.740
 You can't look at everything, it's too complicated,

3:01:47.740 --> 3:01:49.700
 but sometimes you can step back up

3:01:49.700 --> 3:01:51.540
 and make a different decision.

3:01:51.540 --> 3:01:53.460
 And we kind of went through this on the graphic side

3:01:53.460 --> 3:01:56.500
 on Quake, where in some ways it was kind of bad

3:01:56.500 --> 3:01:59.100
 where Michael would spend his time writing,

3:01:59.100 --> 3:02:01.660
 like I'd rough out the basic routines,

3:02:01.660 --> 3:02:03.940
 like, okay, here's our span rasterizer.

3:02:03.940 --> 3:02:05.980
 And he would spend a month writing

3:02:05.980 --> 3:02:10.540
 this beautiful cycle optimized piece of assembly language

3:02:10.540 --> 3:02:13.300
 that does what I asked it to do.

3:02:13.300 --> 3:02:16.100
 And he did it faster than like my original code would do,

3:02:16.100 --> 3:02:17.660
 or probably what I would be able to do

3:02:17.660 --> 3:02:19.540
 even if I had spent that month on it.

3:02:20.420 --> 3:02:22.660
 But then we'd have some cases when I'd be like,

3:02:22.660 --> 3:02:25.460
 okay, well, I figured out at this higher level

3:02:25.460 --> 3:02:28.100
 instead of drawing these in a painter's order here,

3:02:28.100 --> 3:02:32.540
 I do a span buffer and it cuts out 30% or 40%

3:02:32.540 --> 3:02:34.020
 of all of these pixels,

3:02:34.020 --> 3:02:36.580
 but it means you need to rewrite kind of this interface

3:02:36.580 --> 3:02:37.420
 of all of that.

3:02:37.420 --> 3:02:39.340
 And I could tell that wore on him a little bit,

3:02:39.340 --> 3:02:41.940
 but in the end it was the right thing to do

3:02:41.940 --> 3:02:45.100
 where we wound up changing that rasterization approach

3:02:45.100 --> 3:02:47.220
 and we wound up with a super optimized

3:02:47.220 --> 3:02:49.740
 assembly language core loop

3:02:49.740 --> 3:02:51.660
 and then a good system around it

3:02:51.660 --> 3:02:54.380
 which minimized how much that had to be called.

3:02:54.380 --> 3:02:55.740
 And so in order to be able to do

3:02:55.740 --> 3:02:58.140
 this kind of system level thinking,

3:02:58.140 --> 3:03:02.420
 whether we're talking about game development,

3:03:02.420 --> 3:03:07.420
 aerospace, nuclear energy, AI, VR,

3:03:07.420 --> 3:03:10.700
 you have to be able to understand the hardware,

3:03:10.700 --> 3:03:14.740
 the low level software, the high level software,

3:03:14.740 --> 3:03:16.860
 the design decisions, the whole thing,

3:03:16.860 --> 3:03:18.180
 the full stack of it.

3:03:18.180 --> 3:03:20.480
 Yeah, and that's where a lot of these things

3:03:20.480 --> 3:03:21.320
 become possible.

3:03:21.320 --> 3:03:23.940
 When you're really, when you're bringing the future forward,

3:03:23.940 --> 3:03:25.180
 I mean, there's a pace that everything

3:03:25.180 --> 3:03:26.460
 just kind of glides towards

3:03:26.460 --> 3:03:27.960
 where we have a lot of progress

3:03:27.960 --> 3:03:29.340
 that's happening at such a different,

3:03:29.340 --> 3:03:32.300
 so many different ways you kind of slide towards progress

3:03:32.300 --> 3:03:34.880
 just left to your own, programs just get faster.

3:03:34.880 --> 3:03:36.120
 For a while it wasn't clear

3:03:36.120 --> 3:03:38.420
 if they were gonna get fatter more than they get,

3:03:38.420 --> 3:03:40.740
 quicker than they get faster and it cancels out,

3:03:40.740 --> 3:03:42.400
 but it is clear now in retrospect,

3:03:42.400 --> 3:03:44.020
 no, programs just get faster

3:03:44.020 --> 3:03:46.620
 and have gotten faster for a long time.

3:03:46.620 --> 3:03:48.020
 But if you wanna do something

3:03:48.020 --> 3:03:52.060
 like back at that original talking about scrolling games,

3:03:52.060 --> 3:03:54.700
 say what, this needs to be five times faster.

3:03:54.700 --> 3:03:57.220
 Well, we can wait six years

3:03:57.220 --> 3:04:00.820
 and just it'll naturally get that much faster at that time

3:04:00.820 --> 3:04:03.700
 or you come up with some really clever way of doing it.

3:04:03.700 --> 3:04:06.140
 So there are those opportunities like that

3:04:06.140 --> 3:04:08.100
 in a whole bunch of different areas.

3:04:08.100 --> 3:04:11.780
 Now, most programmers don't need to be thinking about that.

3:04:11.780 --> 3:04:13.440
 There's not that many,

3:04:13.440 --> 3:04:15.100
 there's a lot of opportunities for this,

3:04:15.100 --> 3:04:17.240
 but it's not everyone's work a day type stuff.

3:04:17.240 --> 3:04:20.340
 So everyone doesn't have to know how all these things work.

3:04:20.340 --> 3:04:22.900
 They don't have to know how their compiler works,

3:04:22.900 --> 3:04:26.180
 how the processor chip manages cache eviction

3:04:26.180 --> 3:04:28.180
 and all these low level things.

3:04:28.180 --> 3:04:31.720
 But sometimes there are powerful opportunities

3:04:31.720 --> 3:04:33.180
 that you can look at and say,

3:04:33.180 --> 3:04:37.220
 we can bring the future five years faster.

3:04:37.220 --> 3:04:38.420
 We can do something that,

3:04:38.420 --> 3:04:40.300
 wouldn't it be great if we could do this?

3:04:40.300 --> 3:04:42.020
 Well, we can do it today

3:04:42.020 --> 3:04:44.200
 if we make a certain set of decisions.

3:04:44.200 --> 3:04:47.180
 And it is in some ways smoke and mirrors

3:04:47.180 --> 3:04:48.460
 where you say it's like,

3:04:48.460 --> 3:04:50.460
 Doom was a lot of smoke and mirrors

3:04:50.460 --> 3:04:52.260
 where people thought it was more capable

3:04:52.260 --> 3:04:53.560
 than it actually was,

3:04:53.560 --> 3:04:56.020
 but we picked the right smoke and mirrors

3:04:56.020 --> 3:04:58.980
 to deploy in the game where by doing this,

3:04:58.980 --> 3:05:01.100
 people will think that it's more general.

3:05:01.100 --> 3:05:03.420
 We are gonna amaze them with what they've got here

3:05:03.420 --> 3:05:05.020
 and they won't notice

3:05:05.020 --> 3:05:07.660
 that it doesn't do these other things.

3:05:07.660 --> 3:05:09.940
 So smart decision making at that point,

3:05:09.940 --> 3:05:14.940
 that's where that kind of global holistic top down view

3:05:15.740 --> 3:05:16.560
 can work.

3:05:16.560 --> 3:05:20.240
 And I'm really a strong believer

3:05:20.240 --> 3:05:24.020
 that technology should be sitting at that table

3:05:24.020 --> 3:05:25.100
 having those discussions

3:05:25.100 --> 3:05:26.700
 because you do have cases where you say,

3:05:26.700 --> 3:05:28.660
 well, you wanna be the Jonathan Ivy or whatever,

3:05:28.660 --> 3:05:32.100
 where it's a pure design solution.

3:05:32.100 --> 3:05:35.200
 And that's in some cases now

3:05:35.200 --> 3:05:37.740
 where you truly have almost infinite resources.

3:05:37.740 --> 3:05:41.500
 Like if you're trying to do a scrolling game on the PC now,

3:05:41.500 --> 3:05:43.620
 you don't even have to talk to a technology person.

3:05:43.620 --> 3:05:45.460
 You can just have,

3:05:45.460 --> 3:05:48.460
 any intern can make that go run as fast as it needs to there

3:05:48.460 --> 3:05:50.680
 and it can be completely design based.

3:05:50.680 --> 3:05:53.180
 But if you're trying to do something that's hard,

3:05:53.180 --> 3:05:55.840
 either that can't be done for resources

3:05:55.840 --> 3:05:58.060
 like VR on a mobile chip set,

3:05:58.060 --> 3:05:59.820
 or that we don't even know how to do yet,

3:05:59.820 --> 3:06:02.020
 like artificial general intelligence,

3:06:02.020 --> 3:06:03.740
 it's probably going to be a matter

3:06:03.740 --> 3:06:05.380
 of coming at it from an angle.

3:06:05.380 --> 3:06:06.460
 Like, I mean, for AGI,

3:06:06.460 --> 3:06:09.040
 we have some of like what are some of the hudder principles

3:06:09.040 --> 3:06:11.820
 about how you can AXI or some of the,

3:06:11.820 --> 3:06:13.380
 there are theoretical ways that you can say,

3:06:13.380 --> 3:06:15.220
 this is the optimal learning algorithm

3:06:15.220 --> 3:06:18.620
 that can solve everything, but it's completely impractical.

3:06:18.620 --> 3:06:20.180
 You just can't do that.

3:06:20.180 --> 3:06:23.300
 So clearly you have to make some concessions

3:06:23.300 --> 3:06:25.220
 for general intelligence

3:06:25.220 --> 3:06:27.300
 and nobody knows what the right ones are yet.

3:06:27.300 --> 3:06:29.300
 So people are taking different angles of attack.

3:06:29.300 --> 3:06:31.040
 I hope I've got something clever

3:06:31.040 --> 3:06:34.060
 to come up with in that space.

3:06:34.060 --> 3:06:35.460
 It's been surprising to me.

3:06:35.460 --> 3:06:38.760
 And I think perhaps it is a principle of progress

3:06:38.760 --> 3:06:40.580
 that smoke and mirrors somehow

3:06:40.580 --> 3:06:42.820
 is the way you build the future.

3:06:42.820 --> 3:06:46.380
 You kind of fake it till you make it

3:06:46.380 --> 3:06:47.740
 and you almost always make it.

3:06:47.740 --> 3:06:50.340
 And I think that's going to be the way we achieve AGI.

3:06:50.340 --> 3:06:53.620
 That's going to be the way we build consciousness

3:06:53.620 --> 3:06:55.060
 into our machines.

3:06:55.060 --> 3:06:59.860
 There's philosophers debate about the Turing test

3:06:59.860 --> 3:07:02.820
 is essentially about faking it till you make it.

3:07:02.820 --> 3:07:04.480
 You start by faking it.

3:07:04.480 --> 3:07:09.060
 And I think that always leads to making it

3:07:09.060 --> 3:07:10.660
 because if we look at history.

3:07:10.660 --> 3:07:13.100
 Arguments when, as soon as people start talking about

3:07:13.100 --> 3:07:16.220
 qualia and consciousness and Chinese rooms and things,

3:07:16.220 --> 3:07:17.560
 it's like, I just check out.

3:07:17.560 --> 3:07:20.160
 I just don't think there's any value in those conversations.

3:07:20.160 --> 3:07:22.460
 It's just like, go ahead, tell me it's not going to work.

3:07:22.460 --> 3:07:25.340
 I'm going to do my best to try to make it work anyways.

3:07:25.340 --> 3:07:26.900
 I don't know if you work with legged robots.

3:07:26.900 --> 3:07:28.100
 There's a bunch of these.

3:07:29.380 --> 3:07:33.880
 They sure as heck make me feel like they're cautious

3:07:33.880 --> 3:07:37.120
 in a certain way that's not here today,

3:07:37.120 --> 3:07:41.220
 but is you could see the kernel.

3:07:41.220 --> 3:07:45.980
 It's like the flame, the beginnings of a flame.

3:07:45.980 --> 3:07:47.460
 We don't have line of sight,

3:07:47.460 --> 3:07:50.060
 but there's glimmerings of light in the distance

3:07:50.060 --> 3:07:51.020
 for all of these things.

3:07:51.020 --> 3:07:53.560
 Yeah, I'm hearing murmuring in a distant room.

3:07:54.900 --> 3:07:56.780
 Well, let me ask you a human question here.

3:07:56.780 --> 3:08:00.100
 You've in the game design space,

3:08:00.100 --> 3:08:01.900
 you've done a lot of incredible work throughout,

3:08:01.900 --> 3:08:05.800
 but in terms of game design, you have changed the world.

3:08:05.800 --> 3:08:08.440
 And there's a few people around you that did the same.

3:08:08.440 --> 3:08:13.020
 So famously there's some animosity, there's much love,

3:08:13.020 --> 3:08:16.340
 but there's some animosity between you and John Romero.

3:08:16.340 --> 3:08:19.940
 What is at the core of that animosity and human tension?

3:08:19.940 --> 3:08:24.100
 So there really hasn't been for a long time.

3:08:24.100 --> 3:08:25.520
 And even at the beginning, it's like,

3:08:25.520 --> 3:08:29.500
 yes, I did push Romero out of the company.

3:08:29.500 --> 3:08:32.140
 And this is one of the things that I look back,

3:08:32.140 --> 3:08:35.980
 if I could go back telling my younger self

3:08:35.980 --> 3:08:37.840
 some advice about things,

3:08:37.840 --> 3:08:41.900
 the original founding kind of corporate structure

3:08:41.900 --> 3:08:45.700
 of id Software really led to a bunch of problems.

3:08:45.700 --> 3:08:48.540
 We started off with us as equal partners

3:08:48.540 --> 3:08:50.420
 and we had a buy sell agreement

3:08:50.420 --> 3:08:51.820
 because we didn't want outsiders

3:08:51.820 --> 3:08:54.400
 to be telling us what to do inside the company.

3:08:54.400 --> 3:08:57.260
 And that did lead to a bunch of the problems

3:08:57.260 --> 3:08:59.580
 where I was sitting here going,

3:08:59.580 --> 3:09:02.920
 it's like, all right, I'm working harder than anyone.

3:09:02.920 --> 3:09:06.300
 I'm doing these technologies, nobody's done before,

3:09:06.300 --> 3:09:08.100
 but we're all equal partners.

3:09:08.100 --> 3:09:11.500
 And then I see somebody that's not working as hard.

3:09:11.500 --> 3:09:16.160
 And I mean, I can't say I was the most mature about that.

3:09:16.160 --> 3:09:18.020
 I was 20 something years old

3:09:18.020 --> 3:09:22.460
 and it did bother me when I'm like, everybody,

3:09:22.460 --> 3:09:23.980
 okay, we need to all pull together

3:09:23.980 --> 3:09:25.540
 and we've done it before everybody.

3:09:25.540 --> 3:09:27.700
 We know we can do this if we get together

3:09:27.700 --> 3:09:29.420
 and we grind it all out,

3:09:29.420 --> 3:09:33.540
 but not everybody wanted to do that for all time.

3:09:33.540 --> 3:09:35.740
 And I was the youngest one of the crowd there.

3:09:35.740 --> 3:09:40.480
 I had different sets of kind of backgrounds and motivations

3:09:40.480 --> 3:09:44.900
 and left at that point where it was, all right,

3:09:44.900 --> 3:09:48.500
 either everybody has to be contributing like up to this level

3:09:48.500 --> 3:09:51.480
 or they need to get pushed out was not,

3:09:52.380 --> 3:09:54.140
 that was not a great situation.

3:09:54.140 --> 3:09:57.620
 And I look back on it and know that we pushed people

3:09:57.620 --> 3:10:00.300
 out of the company that could have contributed

3:10:00.300 --> 3:10:02.860
 if there was a different framework for them.

3:10:02.860 --> 3:10:04.680
 And the modern kind of Silicon Valley,

3:10:04.680 --> 3:10:07.040
 like let your stock vest over a time period

3:10:07.040 --> 3:10:08.800
 and maybe it's non voting stock

3:10:08.800 --> 3:10:09.820
 and all those different things.

3:10:09.820 --> 3:10:11.420
 We knew nothing about any of that.

3:10:11.420 --> 3:10:13.860
 I mean, we didn't know what we were doing

3:10:13.860 --> 3:10:16.460
 in terms of corporate structure or anything.

3:10:16.460 --> 3:10:18.460
 So if you think the framework was different,

3:10:18.460 --> 3:10:20.660
 some of the human tension could have been a little bit.

3:10:20.660 --> 3:10:22.900
 It almost certainly would have.

3:10:22.900 --> 3:10:24.220
 I mean, I look back at that

3:10:24.220 --> 3:10:27.740
 and it's like even trying to summon up in my mind,

3:10:27.740 --> 3:10:31.580
 it's like, I know I was really, really angry about,

3:10:32.620 --> 3:10:35.580
 like Romero not working as hard as I wanted him to work

3:10:35.580 --> 3:10:39.060
 or not carrying his load on the design for Quake

3:10:39.060 --> 3:10:40.940
 and coming up with things there.

3:10:40.940 --> 3:10:43.100
 But he was definitely doing things.

3:10:43.100 --> 3:10:44.900
 He made some of the best levels there.

3:10:44.900 --> 3:10:47.740
 He was working with some of our external teams

3:10:47.740 --> 3:10:50.660
 like Raven on the licensing side of things,

3:10:50.660 --> 3:10:55.460
 but there were differences of opinion about it,

3:10:55.460 --> 3:10:57.260
 but he landed right on his feet.

3:10:57.260 --> 3:10:59.660
 He went and he got $20 million from Eidos

3:10:59.660 --> 3:11:02.980
 to go do Ion Storm and he got to do things his way

3:11:02.980 --> 3:11:05.700
 and spun up three teams simultaneously

3:11:05.700 --> 3:11:08.180
 because that was always one of the challenging things

3:11:08.180 --> 3:11:11.000
 in it where we were doing these single string,

3:11:11.000 --> 3:11:13.140
 one project after another.

3:11:13.140 --> 3:11:16.380
 And I think some of them wanted to grow the company more

3:11:16.380 --> 3:11:19.240
 and I didn't because I knew people that were saying that,

3:11:19.240 --> 3:11:22.260
 oh, companies turn to shit when you got 50 employees.

3:11:22.260 --> 3:11:24.060
 It's just a different world there.

3:11:24.060 --> 3:11:28.460
 And I loved our little dozen people working on the projects,

3:11:28.460 --> 3:11:29.940
 but you can look at it and say,

3:11:29.940 --> 3:11:31.780
 well, business realities matter.

3:11:31.780 --> 3:11:33.540
 It's like, you're super successful here

3:11:33.540 --> 3:11:36.340
 and we could take a swing and a miss on something,

3:11:36.340 --> 3:11:39.320
 but you do it a couple of times and you're out of luck.

3:11:39.320 --> 3:11:43.060
 There's a reason companies try to have multiple teams

3:11:43.060 --> 3:11:44.460
 running at one time.

3:11:45.660 --> 3:11:47.060
 And so that was, again,

3:11:47.060 --> 3:11:49.620
 something I didn't really appreciate back then.

3:11:49.620 --> 3:11:51.020
 So if you look past all that,

3:11:51.020 --> 3:11:53.740
 you did create some amazing things together.

3:11:53.740 --> 3:11:55.740
 What did you love about John Romero?

3:11:55.740 --> 3:11:57.700
 What did you respect and appreciate about him?

3:11:57.700 --> 3:11:59.100
 What did you admire about him?

3:11:59.100 --> 3:12:00.980
 What did you learn from him?

3:12:00.980 --> 3:12:02.460
 When I met him, he was the coolest programmer

3:12:02.460 --> 3:12:04.020
 I had ever met.

3:12:04.020 --> 3:12:05.580
 He had done all of this stuff.

3:12:05.580 --> 3:12:07.580
 He had made all of these games.

3:12:07.580 --> 3:12:10.060
 He had worked at one of the companies

3:12:10.060 --> 3:12:12.740
 that I thought was the coolest at Origin Systems.

3:12:12.740 --> 3:12:14.580
 And he knew all this stuff.

3:12:14.580 --> 3:12:16.220
 He made things happen fast.

3:12:16.220 --> 3:12:18.900
 And he was also kind of a polymath about this

3:12:18.900 --> 3:12:21.580
 where he could do, he drew his own art.

3:12:21.580 --> 3:12:22.780
 He made his own levels,

3:12:22.780 --> 3:12:26.220
 as well as we worked on sound design systems

3:12:26.220 --> 3:12:29.280
 on top of actually being a really good programmer.

3:12:29.280 --> 3:12:32.020
 And we went through a little,

3:12:32.020 --> 3:12:34.120
 it was kind of fun where one of the early things

3:12:34.120 --> 3:12:36.520
 that we did where there was kind of the young buck bit

3:12:36.520 --> 3:12:39.140
 going in where I was the new guy.

3:12:39.140 --> 3:12:44.140
 And he was the top man programmer at the soft disk area.

3:12:44.500 --> 3:12:47.100
 And eventually we had sort of a challenge over the weekend

3:12:47.100 --> 3:12:49.640
 that we were gonna like race to implement this game,

3:12:49.640 --> 3:12:52.780
 to port one of our PC games back down to the Apple II.

3:12:52.780 --> 3:12:55.180
 And that was where we finally kind of became clear.

3:12:55.180 --> 3:12:57.700
 It's like, okay, Carmack stands a little bit apart

3:12:57.700 --> 3:13:00.260
 on the programming side of things.

3:13:00.260 --> 3:13:03.060
 But Romero then very gracefully moved into,

3:13:03.060 --> 3:13:06.100
 well, he'll work on the tools, he'll work on the systems,

3:13:06.100 --> 3:13:07.620
 do some of the game design stuff,

3:13:07.620 --> 3:13:09.740
 as well as contributing on,

3:13:09.740 --> 3:13:12.880
 starting to lead the design aspects of a lot of things.

3:13:12.880 --> 3:13:16.940
 So he was enormously valuable in the early stuff.

3:13:16.940 --> 3:13:20.540
 And so much of Doom and even Quake have his stamp on it

3:13:20.540 --> 3:13:21.900
 in a lot of ways.

3:13:21.900 --> 3:13:25.640
 But he wasn't at the same level of focus

3:13:25.640 --> 3:13:29.160
 that I brought to the work that we were doing there.

3:13:29.160 --> 3:13:33.540
 And he really did, we hit such a degree of success

3:13:33.540 --> 3:13:35.980
 that it was all in the press about that.

3:13:35.980 --> 3:13:38.540
 The rockstar game programmers.

3:13:38.540 --> 3:13:40.060
 I mean, it's the Beatles problem.

3:13:40.060 --> 3:13:43.340
 Yeah, I mean, he ate it up and he did personify.

3:13:43.340 --> 3:13:46.660
 There was the whole game developers with Ferraris

3:13:46.660 --> 3:13:49.020
 that we had there.

3:13:49.020 --> 3:13:53.520
 And I thought that led to some challenges there.

3:13:53.520 --> 3:13:58.100
 But so much of the stuff that was great in the games

3:13:58.100 --> 3:13:59.260
 did come from him.

3:13:59.260 --> 3:14:01.940
 And I would certainly not take that away from him.

3:14:01.940 --> 3:14:05.500
 And even after we parted ways and he took his swing

3:14:05.500 --> 3:14:09.260
 with Eidos, in some ways, he was ahead of the curve

3:14:09.260 --> 3:14:11.820
 with mobile gaming as well, where

3:14:11.820 --> 3:14:15.540
 one of his companies after Eidos was working on feature phone

3:14:15.540 --> 3:14:16.740
 game development.

3:14:16.740 --> 3:14:19.300
 And I wound up doing some of that

3:14:19.300 --> 3:14:22.300
 just before the iPhone crossing over into the iPhone phase

3:14:22.300 --> 3:14:23.020
 there.

3:14:23.020 --> 3:14:24.900
 And that was something that clearly

3:14:24.900 --> 3:14:27.700
 did turn out to be a huge thing, although he

3:14:27.700 --> 3:14:31.660
 was too early for what he was working on at that time.

3:14:31.660 --> 3:14:34.060
 We've had pretty cordial relationships

3:14:34.060 --> 3:14:35.980
 where I was happy to talk with him any time I'd

3:14:35.980 --> 3:14:38.180
 run into him at a conference.

3:14:38.180 --> 3:14:40.580
 I have actually had some other people just say,

3:14:40.580 --> 3:14:42.940
 it's like, oh, you shouldn't go over there

3:14:42.940 --> 3:14:44.380
 and give him the time of day.

3:14:44.380 --> 3:14:50.940
 Or felt that Masters of Doom played things up in a way

3:14:50.940 --> 3:14:52.500
 that I shouldn't be too happy with.

3:14:52.500 --> 3:14:54.740
 But I'm OK with all of that.

3:14:54.740 --> 3:14:56.700
 So you've still got love in your heart.

3:14:56.700 --> 3:14:59.700
 Yeah, I mean, I just talked with him like last year,

3:14:59.700 --> 3:15:01.060
 or I guess it was even this year,

3:15:01.060 --> 3:15:03.820
 about mentioning that I'm going off doing this AI stuff.

3:15:03.820 --> 3:15:06.580
 I'm going big into artificial intelligence.

3:15:06.580 --> 3:15:09.260
 And he had a bunch of ideas for how

3:15:09.260 --> 3:15:10.940
 AI is going to play into gaming.

3:15:10.940 --> 3:15:13.460
 And asked if I was interested in collaborating.

3:15:13.460 --> 3:15:16.300
 And it's not in line with what I'm doing.

3:15:16.300 --> 3:15:19.620
 But I do wish almost everyone the best.

3:15:19.620 --> 3:15:21.660
 I mean, I know I may not have partnered

3:15:21.660 --> 3:15:24.460
 on the best of terms with some people.

3:15:24.460 --> 3:15:29.100
 But I was thrilled to see Tom Hall writing VR games now.

3:15:29.100 --> 3:15:31.540
 He wrote, I'm working on a game called Demio, which

3:15:31.540 --> 3:15:33.780
 is really an awesome VR game.

3:15:33.780 --> 3:15:35.020
 It's like Dungeons and Dragons.

3:15:35.020 --> 3:15:36.820
 We all used to play Dungeons and Dragons together.

3:15:36.820 --> 3:15:37.900
 That was one of the things.

3:15:37.900 --> 3:15:40.340
 That was what we did on Sundays in the early days.

3:15:40.340 --> 3:15:42.220
 I would Dungeon Master, and they'd all play.

3:15:42.220 --> 3:15:44.980
 And so it really made me smile seeing

3:15:44.980 --> 3:15:49.740
 Tom involved with an RPG game in virtual reality.

3:15:49.740 --> 3:15:54.620
 You were the CTO of Oculus VR since 2013,

3:15:54.620 --> 3:16:00.420
 and maybe less than a year involved in a bit in 2019.

3:16:00.420 --> 3:16:04.900
 Oculus was acquired by Facebook Now Meta in 2014.

3:16:04.900 --> 3:16:07.780
 You've spoken brilliantly about both the low level details,

3:16:07.780 --> 3:16:09.780
 the experimental design, and the big picture

3:16:09.780 --> 3:16:12.020
 vision of virtual reality.

3:16:12.020 --> 3:16:14.980
 Let me ask you about the metaverse, the big question

3:16:14.980 --> 3:16:18.020
 here, both philosophically and technically.

3:16:18.020 --> 3:16:20.180
 How hard is it to build the metaverse?

3:16:20.180 --> 3:16:22.700
 What is the metaverse in your view?

3:16:22.700 --> 3:16:24.980
 You started with discussing and thinking about Quake

3:16:24.980 --> 3:16:27.260
 as a kind of a metaverse.

3:16:27.260 --> 3:16:31.340
 As you think about it today, what is the metaverse,

3:16:31.340 --> 3:16:34.420
 the thing that could create this compelling user value,

3:16:34.420 --> 3:16:36.860
 this experience that will change the world,

3:16:36.860 --> 3:16:39.020
 and how hard is it to build it?

3:16:39.020 --> 3:16:42.020
 So the term comes from Neal Stephenson's book Snow Crash,

3:16:42.020 --> 3:16:44.700
 which many of us had read back in the 90s.

3:16:44.700 --> 3:16:47.500
 It was one of those kind of formative books.

3:16:47.500 --> 3:16:53.100
 And there was this sense that the possibilities

3:16:53.100 --> 3:16:56.100
 and kind of the freedom and unlimited capabilities

3:16:56.100 --> 3:16:59.540
 to build a virtual world that does whatever you want,

3:16:59.540 --> 3:17:02.260
 whatever you ask of it, has been a powerful draw

3:17:02.260 --> 3:17:05.620
 for generations of developers, game developers specifically,

3:17:05.620 --> 3:17:08.900
 and people that are thinking about more general purpose

3:17:08.900 --> 3:17:10.300
 applications.

3:17:10.300 --> 3:17:13.660
 So we were talking about that back in the Doom and Quake days

3:17:13.660 --> 3:17:17.140
 about how do you wind up with an interconnected set of worlds

3:17:17.140 --> 3:17:19.180
 that you kind of visit from one to another.

3:17:19.180 --> 3:17:21.540
 And as web pages were becoming a thing,

3:17:21.540 --> 3:17:25.260
 you start thinking about what is the interactive kind

3:17:25.260 --> 3:17:27.540
 of 3D based equivalent of this.

3:17:27.540 --> 3:17:29.780
 And there were a lot of really bad takes.

3:17:29.780 --> 3:17:34.220
 You had like Vermol and virtual reality markup languages.

3:17:34.220 --> 3:17:38.300
 And there's aspects like that that came from people saying,

3:17:38.300 --> 3:17:40.780
 well, what kind of capabilities should we

3:17:40.780 --> 3:17:43.580
 develop to enable this?

3:17:43.580 --> 3:17:45.620
 And that kind of capability first work

3:17:45.620 --> 3:17:48.940
 has usually not panned out very well.

3:17:48.940 --> 3:17:51.540
 On the other hand, we have successful games

3:17:51.540 --> 3:17:54.340
 that started with things like Doom and Quake and communities

3:17:54.340 --> 3:17:56.820
 that formed around those, whether it

3:17:56.820 --> 3:17:58.700
 was server lists in the early days

3:17:58.700 --> 3:18:01.580
 or literal portaling between different games,

3:18:01.580 --> 3:18:04.780
 and then modern things that are on completely different order

3:18:04.780 --> 3:18:07.380
 of magnitude like Minecraft and Fortnite that

3:18:07.380 --> 3:18:11.820
 have 100 million plus users.

3:18:11.820 --> 3:18:13.700
 I still think that that's the right way

3:18:13.700 --> 3:18:16.900
 to go to build the metaverse is you build something that's

3:18:16.900 --> 3:18:18.980
 amazing that people love and people wind up

3:18:18.980 --> 3:18:21.940
 spending all their time in because it's awesome.

3:18:21.940 --> 3:18:24.420
 And you expand the capabilities of that.

3:18:24.420 --> 3:18:28.420
 So even if it's a very basic experience, if it's awesome.

3:18:28.420 --> 3:18:31.660
 Minecraft is an amazing case study in so many things.

3:18:31.660 --> 3:18:32.660
 That's basic as it gets.

3:18:32.660 --> 3:18:36.860
 What's been able to be done with that is really enlightening.

3:18:36.860 --> 3:18:39.700
 And there are other cases where, like right now,

3:18:39.700 --> 3:18:43.260
 Roblox is basically a game construction kit aimed at kids.

3:18:43.260 --> 3:18:45.020
 And that was a capability first play.

3:18:45.020 --> 3:18:48.060
 And it's achieving scale that's on the same order

3:18:48.060 --> 3:18:49.060
 of those things.

3:18:49.060 --> 3:18:52.580
 So it's not impossible, but my preferred bet

3:18:52.580 --> 3:18:55.180
 would be you make something amazing that people love

3:18:55.180 --> 3:18:56.820
 and you make it better and better.

3:18:56.820 --> 3:18:59.620
 And that's where I could say we could have gone back

3:18:59.620 --> 3:19:02.780
 and followed a path like that in the early days

3:19:02.780 --> 3:19:05.580
 if you just take the same game, whether it's

3:19:05.580 --> 3:19:07.620
 when Activision demonstrated that you could make

3:19:07.620 --> 3:19:09.140
 Call of Duty every year.

3:19:09.140 --> 3:19:12.140
 And not only is it not bad, people love it.

3:19:12.140 --> 3:19:14.460
 And it's very profitable.

3:19:14.460 --> 3:19:17.340
 The idea that you could have taken something like that,

3:19:17.340 --> 3:19:20.220
 take a great game, release a new version every year

3:19:20.220 --> 3:19:23.020
 that lets the capabilities grow and expand

3:19:23.020 --> 3:19:24.660
 to start saying it's like, OK, it's

3:19:24.660 --> 3:19:26.780
 a game about running around and shooting things,

3:19:26.780 --> 3:19:30.260
 but now you can bring your media into it.

3:19:30.260 --> 3:19:35.020
 You can add persistence of social signs of life

3:19:35.020 --> 3:19:37.820
 or whatever you want to add to it.

3:19:37.820 --> 3:19:41.860
 I still think that's quite a good position to take.

3:19:41.860 --> 3:19:45.940
 And I think that while Meta is doing a bottoms up capability

3:19:45.940 --> 3:19:48.740
 approach with Horizon Worlds where it's

3:19:48.740 --> 3:19:51.180
 a fairly general purpose, creators

3:19:51.180 --> 3:19:55.180
 can build whatever they want in their sort of thing,

3:19:55.180 --> 3:19:57.980
 it's hard to compare and compete with something

3:19:57.980 --> 3:20:01.660
 like Fortnite, which also has enormous amounts of creativity

3:20:01.660 --> 3:20:03.660
 even though it was not designed originally

3:20:03.660 --> 3:20:05.740
 as a general purpose sort of thing.

3:20:05.740 --> 3:20:08.500
 So we have examples on both sides.

3:20:08.500 --> 3:20:11.940
 Me personally, I would have bet on trying

3:20:11.940 --> 3:20:15.180
 to do entertainment, valuable destination first,

3:20:15.180 --> 3:20:16.980
 and expanding from there.

3:20:16.980 --> 3:20:22.180
 So can you imagine the thing that will be kind of,

3:20:22.180 --> 3:20:25.300
 if we look back a couple of centuries from now

3:20:25.300 --> 3:20:29.180
 and you think about the experiences that

3:20:29.180 --> 3:20:34.500
 marked the singularity, the transition where most

3:20:34.500 --> 3:20:37.660
 of our world moved into virtual reality,

3:20:37.660 --> 3:20:40.580
 what do you think those experiences will look like?

3:20:40.580 --> 3:20:43.620
 So I do think it's going to be kind of like the way the web

3:20:43.620 --> 3:20:46.620
 slowly took over, where you're the frog

3:20:46.620 --> 3:20:48.860
 in the pot of water that's slowly heating up,

3:20:48.860 --> 3:20:51.420
 where having lived through all of that,

3:20:51.420 --> 3:20:53.660
 I remember when it was shocking to start

3:20:53.660 --> 3:20:57.260
 seeing the first website address on a billboard when you're

3:20:57.260 --> 3:21:00.700
 like, hey, my computer world is infecting the real world.

3:21:00.700 --> 3:21:03.100
 This is spreading out in some way.

3:21:03.100 --> 3:21:05.620
 But when you look back and say, well,

3:21:05.620 --> 3:21:08.260
 what made the web take off?

3:21:08.260 --> 3:21:12.020
 And it wasn't a big bang sort of moment there.

3:21:12.020 --> 3:21:14.540
 It was a bunch of little things that turned out

3:21:14.540 --> 3:21:17.220
 not to even be the things that are relevant now

3:21:17.220 --> 3:21:18.740
 that brought them into it.

3:21:18.740 --> 3:21:23.140
 So I wonder if, I mean, like you said, you're not a historian.

3:21:23.140 --> 3:21:26.580
 So maybe there is a historian out there

3:21:26.580 --> 3:21:30.660
 that could really identify that moment, data driven way.

3:21:30.660 --> 3:21:33.580
 It could be like MySpace or something like that.

3:21:33.580 --> 3:21:37.340
 Maybe the first major social network that really reached

3:21:37.340 --> 3:21:42.180
 into non geek world or something like that.

3:21:42.180 --> 3:21:45.100
 I think that's kind of the fallacy of historians, though,

3:21:45.100 --> 3:21:48.660
 looking for some of those kind of primary dominant causes

3:21:48.660 --> 3:21:51.620
 where so many of these things are like we

3:21:51.620 --> 3:21:52.980
 see an exponential curve.

3:21:52.980 --> 3:21:55.900
 But it's not because like one thing is going exponential.

3:21:55.900 --> 3:21:59.100
 It's because we have hundreds of little sigmoid curves

3:21:59.100 --> 3:22:00.780
 overlapped on top of each other.

3:22:00.780 --> 3:22:02.460
 And they just happen to keep adding up

3:22:02.460 --> 3:22:05.540
 so that you've got something kind of going exponential

3:22:05.540 --> 3:22:06.420
 at any given point.

3:22:06.420 --> 3:22:09.300
 But no single one of them was the critical thing.

3:22:09.300 --> 3:22:11.700
 There were dozens and dozens of things.

3:22:11.700 --> 3:22:13.420
 I mean, seeing the transitions of stuff

3:22:13.420 --> 3:22:16.580
 like as obviously MySpace giving way to other things,

3:22:16.580 --> 3:22:20.180
 but even like blogging giving way to social media

3:22:20.180 --> 3:22:22.860
 and getting resurrected in other guises.

3:22:22.860 --> 3:22:26.060
 And the memes with the dancing baby GIF

3:22:26.060 --> 3:22:29.140
 or whatever the all your base now belong to us.

3:22:29.140 --> 3:22:32.300
 Whatever those early memes that led to the modern memes

3:22:32.300 --> 3:22:37.260
 and the different evolution of humor on the internet

3:22:37.260 --> 3:22:40.700
 that I'm sure the historians will also write books about

3:22:40.700 --> 3:22:42.620
 from the different website that support

3:22:42.620 --> 3:22:45.100
 to create the infrastructure for that humor like Reddit

3:22:45.100 --> 3:22:46.860
 and all that kind of stuff.

3:22:46.860 --> 3:22:48.820
 So people will go back, and they will name

3:22:48.820 --> 3:22:50.340
 firsts and critical moments.

3:22:50.340 --> 3:22:53.420
 But it's probably going to be a poor approximation of what

3:22:53.420 --> 3:22:54.900
 actually happens.

3:22:54.900 --> 3:22:57.500
 And we've already seen in the VR space

3:22:57.500 --> 3:23:01.380
 where it didn't play out the way we thought it would in terms

3:23:01.380 --> 3:23:04.620
 of what was going to be like when the modern era of VR

3:23:04.620 --> 3:23:07.260
 basically started with my E3 demo of Doom 3

3:23:07.260 --> 3:23:08.460
 on the Rift prototype.

3:23:08.460 --> 3:23:10.980
 So we're like first person shooters in VR,

3:23:10.980 --> 3:23:12.860
 match made in heaven, right?

3:23:12.860 --> 3:23:15.500
 And that didn't work out that way at all.

3:23:15.500 --> 3:23:18.420
 They have the most comfort problems with it.

3:23:18.420 --> 3:23:21.220
 And then the most popular virtual reality app

3:23:21.220 --> 3:23:24.820
 is Beat Saber, which nobody predicted back then.

3:23:24.820 --> 3:23:28.740
 What's that make you like from first principles

3:23:28.740 --> 3:23:31.300
 if you were to reverse engineer that?

3:23:31.300 --> 3:23:35.340
 Why are these silly fun games the most?

3:23:35.340 --> 3:23:37.340
 It actually makes very clear sense

3:23:37.340 --> 3:23:40.420
 when you analyze it from hindsight

3:23:40.420 --> 3:23:41.900
 and look at the engineering reasons

3:23:41.900 --> 3:23:45.380
 where it's not just that it was a magical quirky idea.

3:23:45.380 --> 3:23:47.820
 It was something that played almost perfectly

3:23:47.820 --> 3:23:50.460
 to what turned out to be the real strengths of VR

3:23:50.460 --> 3:23:52.940
 where the one thing that I really underestimated

3:23:52.940 --> 3:23:55.940
 importance in VR was the importance of the controllers.

3:23:55.940 --> 3:23:57.700
 I was still thinking we could do a lot more

3:23:57.700 --> 3:24:00.500
 with the game pad and just the amazingness

3:24:00.500 --> 3:24:01.940
 of taking any existing game,

3:24:01.940 --> 3:24:04.300
 being able to move your head around and look around,

3:24:04.300 --> 3:24:06.180
 that that was really amazing.

3:24:06.180 --> 3:24:09.020
 But the controllers were super important.

3:24:09.020 --> 3:24:10.420
 But the problem is so many things

3:24:10.420 --> 3:24:13.420
 that you do with the controllers just suck.

3:24:13.420 --> 3:24:14.700
 It feels like it breaks the illusion

3:24:14.700 --> 3:24:16.900
 like trying to pick up glasses with the controllers

3:24:16.900 --> 3:24:18.540
 where you're like, oh, use the grip button

3:24:18.540 --> 3:24:21.420
 when you're kind of close and it'll snap into your hand.

3:24:21.420 --> 3:24:24.540
 All of those things are unnatural actions

3:24:24.540 --> 3:24:27.660
 that you do them and it's still part of the VR experience.

3:24:27.660 --> 3:24:32.460
 But Beat Saber winds up playing only to the strengths.

3:24:32.460 --> 3:24:34.620
 It completely hides all the weaknesses of it

3:24:34.620 --> 3:24:37.100
 because you are holding something in your hand.

3:24:37.100 --> 3:24:39.340
 You keep a solid grip on it the whole time.

3:24:39.340 --> 3:24:42.300
 It slices through things without ever bumping into things.

3:24:42.300 --> 3:24:44.420
 You never get into the point where,

3:24:44.420 --> 3:24:45.660
 I'm knocking on this table,

3:24:45.660 --> 3:24:48.060
 but in VR, my hand just goes right through it.

3:24:48.060 --> 3:24:51.060
 So you've got something that slices through.

3:24:51.060 --> 3:24:53.100
 So it's never your brain telling you,

3:24:53.100 --> 3:24:54.540
 oh, I should have hit something.

3:24:54.540 --> 3:24:55.780
 You've got a lightsaber here.

3:24:55.780 --> 3:24:58.980
 It's just, you expect it to slice through everything.

3:24:58.980 --> 3:25:02.460
 Audio and music turned out to be a really powerful aspect

3:25:02.460 --> 3:25:05.180
 of virtual reality where you're blocking the world off

3:25:05.180 --> 3:25:07.580
 and constructing the world around you.

3:25:07.580 --> 3:25:10.900
 And being something that can run efficiently

3:25:10.900 --> 3:25:13.700
 on even this relatively low powered hardware

3:25:13.700 --> 3:25:17.660
 and can have a valuable loop in a small amount of time

3:25:17.660 --> 3:25:19.500
 where a lot of modern games,

3:25:19.500 --> 3:25:21.460
 you're supposed to sit down and play it for an hour

3:25:21.460 --> 3:25:22.300
 just to get anywhere.

3:25:22.300 --> 3:25:23.660
 Sometimes a new game takes an hour

3:25:23.660 --> 3:25:25.340
 to get through the tutorial level.

3:25:25.340 --> 3:25:27.860
 And that's not good for VR for a couple reasons.

3:25:27.860 --> 3:25:29.700
 You do still have the comfort issues

3:25:29.700 --> 3:25:31.460
 if you're moving around at all,

3:25:31.460 --> 3:25:34.780
 but you've also got just discomfort from the headset,

3:25:34.780 --> 3:25:37.500
 battery lifespan on the mobile versions.

3:25:37.500 --> 3:25:39.140
 So having things that do break down

3:25:39.140 --> 3:25:42.140
 into three and four minute windows of play,

3:25:42.140 --> 3:25:43.780
 that turns out to be very valuable

3:25:43.780 --> 3:25:45.780
 from a gameplay standpoint.

3:25:45.780 --> 3:25:48.180
 So it winds up being kind of a perfect storm

3:25:48.180 --> 3:25:50.060
 of all of these things that are really good.

3:25:50.060 --> 3:25:52.060
 It doesn't have any of the comfort problems.

3:25:52.060 --> 3:25:53.380
 You're not navigating around.

3:25:53.380 --> 3:25:54.620
 You're standing still.

3:25:54.620 --> 3:25:56.580
 All the stuff flies at you.

3:25:56.580 --> 3:25:59.380
 It has placed audio strengths.

3:25:59.380 --> 3:26:01.580
 It adds the whole fitness in VR.

3:26:01.580 --> 3:26:04.460
 Nobody was thinking about that back at the beginning.

3:26:04.460 --> 3:26:07.420
 And it turns out that that is an excellent

3:26:07.420 --> 3:26:09.060
 daily fitness thing to be doing.

3:26:09.060 --> 3:26:11.860
 If you go play an hour of Beat Saber

3:26:11.860 --> 3:26:13.500
 or Supernatural or something,

3:26:13.500 --> 3:26:16.420
 that is legit solid exercise.

3:26:16.420 --> 3:26:17.980
 And it's more fun than doing it

3:26:17.980 --> 3:26:19.900
 just about any other way there.

3:26:19.900 --> 3:26:23.460
 So that's kind of the arcade stage of things.

3:26:23.460 --> 3:26:27.140
 If I were to say with my experience with VR,

3:26:27.140 --> 3:26:30.620
 the thing that I think is powerful is the,

3:26:30.620 --> 3:26:32.580
 maybe it's not here yet,

3:26:32.580 --> 3:26:35.100
 but the degree to which it is immersive

3:26:35.100 --> 3:26:38.380
 in the way that Quake is immersive.

3:26:38.380 --> 3:26:40.260
 It takes you to another world.

3:26:40.260 --> 3:26:43.060
 For me, because I'm a fan of role playing games,

3:26:44.340 --> 3:26:47.140
 the Elder Scrolls series,

3:26:47.140 --> 3:26:50.180
 like Skyrim or even Daggerfall,

3:26:50.180 --> 3:26:52.540
 it just takes you to another world.

3:26:52.540 --> 3:26:53.940
 And when you're not in that world,

3:26:53.940 --> 3:26:55.860
 you miss not being there.

3:26:55.860 --> 3:26:58.820
 And then you just, you kind of want to stay there forever

3:26:58.820 --> 3:27:00.940
 because life is shitty.

3:27:00.940 --> 3:27:04.300
 And you just want to go to this place.

3:27:04.300 --> 3:27:09.300
 Is that there was a time when we were kind of asked

3:27:09.340 --> 3:27:12.060
 to come up with like, what's your view about VR?

3:27:12.060 --> 3:27:15.620
 And my pitch was that it should be better

3:27:15.620 --> 3:27:17.220
 inside the headset than outside.

3:27:17.220 --> 3:27:19.460
 It's the world as you want it.

3:27:19.460 --> 3:27:21.660
 And everybody thought that was dystopian.

3:27:21.660 --> 3:27:23.300
 And like, that's like, oh,

3:27:23.300 --> 3:27:25.580
 you're just going to forget about the world outside.

3:27:25.580 --> 3:27:29.700
 And I don't get that mindset where the idea

3:27:29.700 --> 3:27:32.860
 that if you can make the world better inside the headset

3:27:32.860 --> 3:27:36.220
 than outside, you've just improved the person's life

3:27:36.220 --> 3:27:38.500
 that has a headset that can wear it.

3:27:38.500 --> 3:27:41.300
 And there are plenty of things that we just can't do

3:27:41.300 --> 3:27:42.380
 for everyone in the real world.

3:27:42.380 --> 3:27:44.900
 Everybody can't have Richard Branson's Private Island,

3:27:44.900 --> 3:27:47.180
 but everyone can have a private VR Island

3:27:47.180 --> 3:27:49.100
 and it can have the things that they want on it.

3:27:49.100 --> 3:27:51.620
 And there's a lot of these kind of rivalrous goods

3:27:51.620 --> 3:27:55.580
 in the real world that VR can just be better at.

3:27:55.580 --> 3:27:57.740
 We can do a lot of things like that

3:27:57.740 --> 3:27:59.620
 that can be very, very rich.

3:27:59.620 --> 3:28:01.020
 So yeah, I want the,

3:28:01.020 --> 3:28:02.380
 I think it's going to be a positive thing,

3:28:02.380 --> 3:28:05.420
 this world where people want to go back into their headset,

3:28:05.420 --> 3:28:07.980
 where it can be better than somebody that's living

3:28:07.980 --> 3:28:10.860
 in a tiny apartment can have a palatial estate

3:28:10.860 --> 3:28:11.980
 in virtual reality.

3:28:11.980 --> 3:28:13.940
 They can have all their friends from all over the world

3:28:13.940 --> 3:28:16.620
 come over and visit them without everybody getting

3:28:16.620 --> 3:28:19.300
 on a plane and meeting in some place

3:28:19.300 --> 3:28:21.620
 and dealing with all the other logistics hassles.

3:28:21.620 --> 3:28:25.460
 There is real value in the presence that you can get

3:28:25.460 --> 3:28:26.540
 for remote meetings.

3:28:26.540 --> 3:28:30.100
 It's all the little things that we need to sort out,

3:28:30.100 --> 3:28:32.860
 but those are things that we have line of sight on.

3:28:32.860 --> 3:28:35.980
 People that have been in like a good VR meeting

3:28:35.980 --> 3:28:38.180
 using work rooms where you can say,

3:28:38.180 --> 3:28:40.380
 oh, that was better than a Zoom meeting.

3:28:40.380 --> 3:28:42.900
 But of course it's more of a hassle to get into it.

3:28:42.900 --> 3:28:44.380
 Not everyone has the headset.

3:28:44.380 --> 3:28:46.260
 Interoperability is worse.

3:28:46.260 --> 3:28:48.620
 You can't have, you cap out at a certain number.

3:28:48.620 --> 3:28:50.620
 There's all these things that need to be fixed,

3:28:50.620 --> 3:28:52.340
 but that's one of those things you can look at and say,

3:28:52.340 --> 3:28:54.220
 we know there's value there.

3:28:54.220 --> 3:28:56.300
 We just need to really grind hard,

3:28:56.300 --> 3:28:59.460
 file off all the rough edges and make that possible.

3:28:59.460 --> 3:29:02.020
 So you do think we have line of sight

3:29:02.020 --> 3:29:06.020
 because there's a reason like,

3:29:06.980 --> 3:29:09.500
 I do this podcast in person, for example.

3:29:09.500 --> 3:29:14.060
 So doing it remotely, it's not the same.

3:29:14.060 --> 3:29:16.940
 And if somebody were to ask me why it's not the same,

3:29:16.940 --> 3:29:19.220
 I wouldn't be able to write down exactly why.

3:29:20.540 --> 3:29:23.380
 But you're saying that it's possible,

3:29:23.380 --> 3:29:26.980
 whatever the magic is for in person interaction,

3:29:26.980 --> 3:29:30.500
 that immersiveness of the experience,

3:29:30.500 --> 3:29:32.180
 we are almost there.

3:29:32.180 --> 3:29:34.380
 Yes, so the idea of like,

3:29:34.380 --> 3:29:37.700
 I'm doing a VR interview with someone.

3:29:37.700 --> 3:29:39.580
 I'm not saying it's here right now,

3:29:39.580 --> 3:29:42.620
 but you can see glimmers of what it should be.

3:29:42.620 --> 3:29:46.020
 And we largely know what would need to be fixed

3:29:46.020 --> 3:29:48.020
 and improved to, like you say,

3:29:48.020 --> 3:29:50.580
 there's a difference between at remote interview

3:29:50.580 --> 3:29:53.900
 doing a podcast over Zoom or something and face to face.

3:29:53.900 --> 3:29:56.460
 There's that sense of presence, that immediacy,

3:29:56.460 --> 3:29:59.060
 the super low latency responsiveness,

3:29:59.060 --> 3:30:01.420
 being able to see all the subtle things there,

3:30:01.420 --> 3:30:03.700
 just occupying the same field of view.

3:30:03.700 --> 3:30:04.860
 And all of those are things

3:30:04.860 --> 3:30:07.740
 that we absolutely can do in VR.

3:30:07.740 --> 3:30:10.460
 And that simple case of a small meeting

3:30:10.460 --> 3:30:13.020
 with a couple of people, that's the much easier case

3:30:13.020 --> 3:30:15.260
 than everybody thinks the Ready Player One multiverse

3:30:15.260 --> 3:30:18.420
 with a thousand people going across a huge bridge

3:30:18.420 --> 3:30:20.020
 to amazing places,

3:30:20.020 --> 3:30:22.420
 that's harder in a lot of other technical ways.

3:30:22.420 --> 3:30:24.100
 Not to say we can't also do that,

3:30:24.100 --> 3:30:26.540
 but that's further away and has more challenges.

3:30:26.540 --> 3:30:29.620
 But this small thing about being able to have a meeting

3:30:29.620 --> 3:30:33.820
 with one or a few people and have it feel real,

3:30:33.820 --> 3:30:35.500
 feel like you're there,

3:30:35.500 --> 3:30:37.900
 like you have the same interactions and talking with them,

3:30:37.900 --> 3:30:40.420
 you get subtle cues as we start getting eye

3:30:40.420 --> 3:30:42.260
 and face tracking and some of the other things

3:30:42.260 --> 3:30:43.900
 on high end headsets.

3:30:43.900 --> 3:30:46.340
 A lot of that is going to come over

3:30:46.340 --> 3:30:49.100
 and it doesn't have to be as good.

3:30:49.100 --> 3:30:51.060
 This is an important thing that people miss

3:30:51.060 --> 3:30:54.060
 where there was a lot of people that,

3:30:54.060 --> 3:30:57.140
 especially rich people that would look at VR and say,

3:30:57.140 --> 3:30:59.780
 it's like, oh, this just isn't that good.

3:30:59.780 --> 3:31:00.980
 And I'd say, it's like, well,

3:31:00.980 --> 3:31:05.100
 you've already been courtside backstage and on pit row

3:31:05.100 --> 3:31:06.980
 and you've done all of these experiences

3:31:06.980 --> 3:31:08.740
 because you get to do them in real life.

3:31:08.740 --> 3:31:10.660
 But most people don't get to.

3:31:10.660 --> 3:31:13.380
 And even if the experience is only half as good,

3:31:13.380 --> 3:31:15.020
 if it's something that they never would have gotten

3:31:15.020 --> 3:31:17.780
 to do before, it's still a very good thing.

3:31:17.780 --> 3:31:20.900
 And as we can just, we can push that number up over time.

3:31:20.900 --> 3:31:24.140
 It has a minimum viable value level

3:31:24.140 --> 3:31:27.220
 when it does something that is valuable enough to people,

3:31:27.220 --> 3:31:29.980
 as long as it's better inside the headset on any metric

3:31:29.980 --> 3:31:32.620
 than it is outside and people choose to go there,

3:31:32.620 --> 3:31:33.980
 we're on the right path.

3:31:33.980 --> 3:31:35.580
 And we have a value gradient

3:31:35.580 --> 3:31:37.100
 that I'm just always hammering on.

3:31:37.100 --> 3:31:39.060
 We can just follow this value gradient,

3:31:39.060 --> 3:31:41.020
 just keep making things better

3:31:41.020 --> 3:31:44.540
 rather than going for that one, close your eyes,

3:31:44.540 --> 3:31:48.740
 swing for the fences, kind of silver bullet approach.

3:31:48.740 --> 3:31:50.500
 Well, I wonder if there's a value gradient

3:31:50.500 --> 3:31:53.460
 for in person meetings, because if you get that right,

3:31:53.460 --> 3:31:54.940
 I mean, that would change the world.

3:31:54.940 --> 3:31:57.020
 Yeah. That it doesn't need to,

3:31:57.020 --> 3:31:59.380
 I mean, you don't need a ready player one.

3:31:59.380 --> 3:32:02.780
 But I wonder if there's that value gradient

3:32:02.780 --> 3:32:07.780
 you can follow along, because if there is and you follow it,

3:32:08.020 --> 3:32:11.500
 then there'll be a certain like phase shift

3:32:11.500 --> 3:32:14.660
 at a certain point where people will shift

3:32:14.660 --> 3:32:18.620
 from Zoom to this.

3:32:18.620 --> 3:32:23.220
 I wonder, what are the bottlenecks?

3:32:23.220 --> 3:32:25.380
 Is it software, is it hardware?

3:32:25.380 --> 3:32:27.780
 Is it like, is it all about latency?

3:32:27.780 --> 3:32:30.460
 So I have big arguments internally

3:32:30.460 --> 3:32:32.740
 about strategic things like that,

3:32:32.740 --> 3:32:36.700
 where like the next headset that's coming out

3:32:36.700 --> 3:32:38.980
 that we've made various announcements about

3:32:38.980 --> 3:32:40.460
 is gonna be a higher end headset,

3:32:40.460 --> 3:32:41.980
 more expensive, more features.

3:32:41.980 --> 3:32:45.500
 Lots of people wanna make those trade offs.

3:32:45.500 --> 3:32:47.180
 We'll see what the market has to say

3:32:47.180 --> 3:32:49.740
 about the exact trade offs we've made here.

3:32:49.740 --> 3:32:51.420
 But if you wanna replace Zoom,

3:32:51.420 --> 3:32:53.780
 you need to have something that everybody has.

3:32:55.180 --> 3:32:56.420
 So you like cheaper.

3:32:56.420 --> 3:33:00.140
 I like cheaper because also lighter and cheaper

3:33:00.140 --> 3:33:03.300
 wind up being a virtuous cycle there

3:33:03.300 --> 3:33:05.540
 where expensive and more features

3:33:05.540 --> 3:33:07.220
 tends to also lead towards heavier.

3:33:07.220 --> 3:33:09.620
 And it just kind of goes, it's like, let's add more features.

3:33:09.620 --> 3:33:13.340
 The features are not, they have physical presence

3:33:13.340 --> 3:33:16.100
 and weight and draw from batteries and all of those things.

3:33:16.100 --> 3:33:21.100
 So I've always favored a lower end, cheaper, faster approach.

3:33:21.340 --> 3:33:24.340
 That's why I was always behind the mobile side of VR

3:33:24.340 --> 3:33:26.700
 rather than the higher end PC headsets.

3:33:26.700 --> 3:33:29.460
 And I think that's proven out well.

3:33:29.460 --> 3:33:32.900
 But there's, ideally we have a whole range of things,

3:33:32.900 --> 3:33:35.380
 but if you've only got one or two things,

3:33:35.380 --> 3:33:37.220
 it's important that those two things cover

3:33:37.220 --> 3:33:40.580
 the scope that you think is most important.

3:33:40.580 --> 3:33:42.500
 When we're in a world when it's like cell phones

3:33:42.500 --> 3:33:44.020
 and there's 50 of them on the market

3:33:44.020 --> 3:33:46.980
 covering every conceivable ecological niche you want,

3:33:46.980 --> 3:33:47.940
 that's gonna be great,

3:33:47.940 --> 3:33:49.940
 but we're not gonna be there for a while.

3:33:49.940 --> 3:33:51.580
 Where are the bottlenecks?

3:33:51.580 --> 3:33:53.380
 Is it the hardware or the software?

3:33:53.380 --> 3:33:56.300
 Yeah, so right now you can play,

3:33:56.300 --> 3:33:58.900
 you can get work rooms on Quest

3:33:58.900 --> 3:34:00.340
 and you can set up these things

3:34:00.340 --> 3:34:01.700
 and it's a pretty good experience.

3:34:01.700 --> 3:34:02.700
 It's surprisingly good.

3:34:02.700 --> 3:34:03.740
 I haven't tried it.

3:34:03.740 --> 3:34:05.060
 It's surprisingly good.

3:34:05.060 --> 3:34:08.100
 Yeah, the voice latency is better on that

3:34:08.100 --> 3:34:10.140
 than a lot better than a Zoom meeting.

3:34:10.140 --> 3:34:13.580
 So you've got a more, a better sense of immediacy there.

3:34:13.580 --> 3:34:17.100
 The expressions that you get from the current hardware

3:34:17.100 --> 3:34:20.060
 with just kind of your controllers and your head

3:34:20.060 --> 3:34:21.580
 is pretty realistic feeling.

3:34:21.580 --> 3:34:23.300
 You've got a pretty good sense of being there

3:34:23.300 --> 3:34:24.140
 with someone with it.

3:34:24.140 --> 3:34:27.500
 Are these like avatars of people?

3:34:27.500 --> 3:34:28.340
 Yeah.

3:34:28.340 --> 3:34:29.900
 Do you get to see their body?

3:34:29.900 --> 3:34:30.940
 Yeah.

3:34:30.940 --> 3:34:32.420
 And they're sitting around a table?

3:34:32.420 --> 3:34:33.300
 Yeah.

3:34:33.300 --> 3:34:35.660
 And it feels better than Zoom?

3:34:35.660 --> 3:34:36.500
 It feels better than you, yeah,

3:34:36.500 --> 3:34:37.780
 better than you'd expect for that.

3:34:37.780 --> 3:34:42.180
 It is definitely, yeah, I'd say it's quite a bit better

3:34:42.180 --> 3:34:43.860
 than Zoom when everything's working right,

3:34:43.860 --> 3:34:46.420
 but there's still all the rough edges of,

3:34:46.420 --> 3:34:48.220
 the reason Zoom became so successful

3:34:48.220 --> 3:34:51.020
 is because they just nailed the usability of everything.

3:34:51.020 --> 3:34:54.940
 It's high quality with a absolutely first rate experience.

3:34:54.940 --> 3:34:58.020
 And we are not there yet with any of the VR stuff.

3:34:58.020 --> 3:35:00.740
 I'm trying to push hard to get,

3:35:00.740 --> 3:35:02.420
 I keep talking about it's like,

3:35:02.420 --> 3:35:05.020
 it needs to just be one click to make everything happen.

3:35:05.020 --> 3:35:07.620
 And we're getting there in our home environment,

3:35:07.620 --> 3:35:09.260
 not the whole work rooms application,

3:35:09.260 --> 3:35:11.740
 but the main home where you can now kind of go over

3:35:11.740 --> 3:35:12.660
 and click and invite,

3:35:12.660 --> 3:35:15.220
 and it still winds up taking five times longer

3:35:15.220 --> 3:35:16.260
 than it should,

3:35:16.260 --> 3:35:19.460
 but we're getting close to that where you click there,

3:35:19.460 --> 3:35:22.020
 they click on their button and then they're sitting there

3:35:22.020 --> 3:35:23.860
 in this good presence with you,

3:35:23.860 --> 3:35:25.940
 but latencies need to get a lot better.

3:35:25.940 --> 3:35:28.780
 User interface needs to get a lot better.

3:35:28.780 --> 3:35:30.940
 Ubiquity of the headsets needs to get better.

3:35:30.940 --> 3:35:33.780
 We need to have a hundred million of them out there

3:35:33.780 --> 3:35:35.420
 just so that everybody knows somebody

3:35:35.420 --> 3:35:37.260
 that uses this all the time.

3:35:37.260 --> 3:35:38.540
 Well, I think it's a virtuous cycle

3:35:38.540 --> 3:35:42.780
 because I do think the interface

3:35:44.140 --> 3:35:48.140
 is the thing that makes or breaks this kind of revolution.

3:35:48.140 --> 3:35:50.860
 It's so interesting how like you said one click,

3:35:50.860 --> 3:35:53.980
 but it's also like how you achieve that one click.

3:35:53.980 --> 3:35:54.820
 I don't know.

3:35:54.820 --> 3:35:58.620
 What is, can I ask a dark question?

3:35:58.620 --> 3:36:00.700
 Maybe let's keep it outside of meta,

3:36:00.700 --> 3:36:05.020
 but this is about meta, but also Google and big company.

3:36:05.020 --> 3:36:07.940
 Are they able to do this kind of thing?

3:36:07.940 --> 3:36:12.180
 It seems like, let me put on my cranky old man hat,

3:36:12.180 --> 3:36:15.660
 is they seem to not do a good job

3:36:15.660 --> 3:36:20.500
 of creating these user friendly interfaces

3:36:20.500 --> 3:36:22.900
 as they get bigger and bigger as a company.

3:36:22.900 --> 3:36:25.980
 Like Google has created some of the greatest interfaces ever

3:36:27.100 --> 3:36:30.300
 early on in its, I mean, creating Gmail,

3:36:30.300 --> 3:36:33.820
 just so many brilliant interfaces

3:36:33.820 --> 3:36:35.940
 and it just seems to be getting crappier

3:36:35.940 --> 3:36:37.220
 and crappier at that.

3:36:37.220 --> 3:36:42.180
 Same with meta, same with Microsoft.

3:36:42.180 --> 3:36:45.020
 It's just, it seems to get worse and worse at that.

3:36:45.020 --> 3:36:46.100
 I don't know what it is,

3:36:46.100 --> 3:36:47.620
 because you've become more conservative,

3:36:47.620 --> 3:36:49.980
 careful, risk averse.

3:36:49.980 --> 3:36:51.140
 Is that why?

3:36:51.140 --> 3:36:51.980
 Can you speak to that?

3:36:51.980 --> 3:36:53.500
 It's been really eye opening to me

3:36:53.500 --> 3:36:55.420
 working inside a tech titan,

3:36:55.420 --> 3:36:59.460
 where I had my small companies

3:36:59.460 --> 3:37:03.500
 and then we're acquired by a midsize game publisher

3:37:03.500 --> 3:37:06.740
 and then Oculus getting acquired by meta

3:37:06.740 --> 3:37:08.860
 and meta has grown by a factor of many

3:37:08.860 --> 3:37:12.980
 just in the eight years since the acquisition.

3:37:12.980 --> 3:37:16.260
 So I did not have experience with this

3:37:16.260 --> 3:37:19.740
 and it was interesting because I remember like previously

3:37:19.740 --> 3:37:23.020
 my benchmark for kind of use of resources

3:37:23.020 --> 3:37:25.300
 was some of the government programs I interacted with

3:37:25.300 --> 3:37:26.900
 on the aerospace side.

3:37:26.900 --> 3:37:28.860
 And I remember thinking there was,

3:37:28.860 --> 3:37:30.340
 okay, there's an air force program

3:37:30.340 --> 3:37:34.340
 and they spent $50 million and they didn't launch anything.

3:37:34.340 --> 3:37:35.500
 They didn't even build anything.

3:37:35.500 --> 3:37:39.020
 It was just kind of like they made a bunch of papers

3:37:39.020 --> 3:37:42.180
 and had some parts in a warehouse and nothing came of it.

3:37:42.180 --> 3:37:47.180
 It's like $50 million and I've had to radically recalibrate

3:37:47.740 --> 3:37:50.540
 my sense of like how much money can be spent

3:37:50.540 --> 3:37:54.060
 with mediocre resources.

3:37:54.060 --> 3:37:58.020
 Where on the plus side, VR has turned out,

3:37:58.020 --> 3:38:02.260
 we've built pretty much exactly what,

3:38:02.260 --> 3:38:03.900
 we just passed the 10 year mark then

3:38:03.900 --> 3:38:06.940
 from like my first demo of the Rift.

3:38:06.940 --> 3:38:09.580
 And if I could have said what I wanted to have,

3:38:09.580 --> 3:38:12.860
 it would have been a standalone inside out tracked

3:38:12.860 --> 3:38:15.820
 4K resolution headset that I,

3:38:15.820 --> 3:38:18.380
 that could still plug into a PC for high end rendering.

3:38:18.380 --> 3:38:20.900
 And that's exactly what we've got on Quest 2 right now.

3:38:20.900 --> 3:38:22.660
 Yes, first of all, let's pause on that

3:38:22.660 --> 3:38:24.980
 with me being cranky and everything.

3:38:24.980 --> 3:38:29.980
 It's what Meta achieved with Oculus and so on is incredible.

3:38:30.180 --> 3:38:34.060
 I mean, this is, when I thought about the future of VR,

3:38:34.060 --> 3:38:36.740
 this is what I imagined in terms of hardware, I would say.

3:38:36.740 --> 3:38:39.260
 And maybe in terms of the experience as well,

3:38:39.260 --> 3:38:42.100
 but it's still not there somehow.

3:38:42.100 --> 3:38:44.620
 On the one hand, we did kind of achieve it and win.

3:38:44.620 --> 3:38:48.140
 And we've got, we've sold, we're a success right now,

3:38:48.140 --> 3:38:51.260
 but the amount of resources that have gone into it,

3:38:51.260 --> 3:38:53.540
 it winds up getting cluttered up in accounting

3:38:53.540 --> 3:38:58.380
 where Mark did announce that they spent $10 billion a year,

3:38:58.380 --> 3:38:59.540
 like on Reality Labs.

3:38:59.540 --> 3:39:01.740
 Now Reality Labs covers a lot.

3:39:01.740 --> 3:39:04.300
 It was, VR was not the large part of it.

3:39:04.300 --> 3:39:05.860
 It also had Portal and Spark

3:39:05.860 --> 3:39:08.180
 and the big AR research efforts.

3:39:08.180 --> 3:39:11.060
 And it's been expanding out to include AI

3:39:11.060 --> 3:39:15.540
 and other things there where there's a lot going on there.

3:39:15.540 --> 3:39:18.140
 But $10 billion was just a number

3:39:18.140 --> 3:39:20.260
 that I had trouble processing.

3:39:20.260 --> 3:39:22.460
 It's just, I feel sick to my stomach

3:39:22.460 --> 3:39:24.980
 thinking about that much money being spent.

3:39:24.980 --> 3:39:27.820
 But that's how they demonstrate commitment to this,

3:39:27.820 --> 3:39:31.420
 where it's not more so than like, yeah,

3:39:31.420 --> 3:39:34.100
 Google goes and cancels all of these projects,

3:39:34.100 --> 3:39:36.060
 different things like that,

3:39:36.060 --> 3:39:39.500
 while Meta is really sticking with the funding of VR

3:39:39.500 --> 3:39:41.900
 and AR is still further out with it.

3:39:41.900 --> 3:39:43.900
 So there's something to be said for that.

3:39:44.780 --> 3:39:46.940
 It's not just gonna vanish, the work's going in.

3:39:46.940 --> 3:39:48.740
 I just wish it could be,

3:39:48.740 --> 3:39:51.740
 all those resources could be applied more effectively

3:39:51.740 --> 3:39:53.740
 because I see all these cases.

3:39:53.740 --> 3:39:56.900
 I point out these examples of how a third party

3:39:56.900 --> 3:39:58.940
 that we're kind of competing with in various ways.

3:39:58.940 --> 3:40:00.580
 There's a number of these examples

3:40:00.580 --> 3:40:03.820
 and they do work with a 10th of the people

3:40:03.820 --> 3:40:06.940
 that we do internally and a lot of it comes from,

3:40:06.940 --> 3:40:10.060
 yes, the small company can just go do it

3:40:10.060 --> 3:40:12.860
 while in a big company, you do have to worry about,

3:40:13.860 --> 3:40:16.740
 is there some SDK internally that you should be using

3:40:16.740 --> 3:40:18.140
 because another team's making it,

3:40:18.140 --> 3:40:21.020
 you have to have your cross functional group meetups

3:40:21.020 --> 3:40:22.260
 for different things.

3:40:22.260 --> 3:40:25.260
 You do have more concerns about privacy

3:40:25.260 --> 3:40:28.900
 or diversity and equity and safety of different things,

3:40:28.900 --> 3:40:31.860
 parental issues and things that a small startup company

3:40:31.860 --> 3:40:36.540
 can just kind of cowboy off and do something interesting.

3:40:36.540 --> 3:40:39.380
 And there's a lot more that is a problem

3:40:39.380 --> 3:40:41.460
 that you have to pay attention to in the big companies,

3:40:41.460 --> 3:40:43.860
 but I'm not willing to believe that we are within

3:40:43.860 --> 3:40:46.300
 even a factor of two or four

3:40:46.300 --> 3:40:48.820
 of what the efficiency could be.

3:40:48.820 --> 3:40:52.020
 I am constantly kind of crying out for it's like,

3:40:52.020 --> 3:40:53.460
 we can do better than this.

3:40:53.460 --> 3:40:55.100
 And you wonder what the mechanisms

3:40:55.100 --> 3:40:57.620
 to unlock that efficiency are.

3:40:57.620 --> 3:41:02.500
 I don't, there is some sense in a large company

3:41:02.500 --> 3:41:05.700
 that like an individual engineer might not believe

3:41:05.700 --> 3:41:07.140
 that they can change the world.

3:41:07.140 --> 3:41:11.460
 Maybe you delegate a little bit of the responsibility

3:41:11.460 --> 3:41:14.420
 to be the one who changes the world in a big company,

3:41:14.420 --> 3:41:19.420
 I think, but the reality is like the world will get changed

3:41:19.460 --> 3:41:21.380
 by a single engineer anyway.

3:41:21.380 --> 3:41:24.420
 So if whether inside Google or inside a startup,

3:41:24.420 --> 3:41:26.300
 it doesn't matter, it's just like Google

3:41:26.300 --> 3:41:29.740
 and Meta needs to help those engineers believe

3:41:29.740 --> 3:41:32.860
 they're the ones that are gonna decrease that latency.

3:41:32.860 --> 3:41:37.220
 It'll take one John Carmack, the 20 year old Carmack

3:41:37.220 --> 3:41:40.580
 that's inside Meta right now to change everything.

3:41:40.580 --> 3:41:43.060
 And I try to point that out and push people.

3:41:43.060 --> 3:41:45.060
 It's like, try to go ahead.

3:41:45.060 --> 3:41:46.780
 And when you see some, because there is,

3:41:46.780 --> 3:41:48.860
 you get the silo mentality where you're like,

3:41:48.860 --> 3:41:50.940
 okay, I know something's not right over there,

3:41:50.940 --> 3:41:53.780
 but I'm staying in my lane here.

3:41:53.780 --> 3:41:57.380
 And there's a couple of people that I can think about

3:41:57.380 --> 3:41:59.580
 that are willing to just like hop all over the place

3:41:59.580 --> 3:42:01.140
 and man, I treasure them.

3:42:01.140 --> 3:42:03.980
 The people that are just willing to, they're fearless.

3:42:03.980 --> 3:42:06.380
 They will go over and they will go rebuild the kernel

3:42:06.380 --> 3:42:08.260
 and change this distribution and go in

3:42:08.260 --> 3:42:11.860
 and hack a firmware over here to get something done right.

3:42:11.860 --> 3:42:14.220
 And that is relatively rare.

3:42:14.220 --> 3:42:15.780
 There's thousands of developers

3:42:15.780 --> 3:42:17.580
 and you've got a small handful that are willing

3:42:17.580 --> 3:42:19.540
 to operate at that level.

3:42:19.540 --> 3:42:22.140
 And it's potentially risky for them.

3:42:22.140 --> 3:42:24.940
 The politics are real in a lot of that.

3:42:24.940 --> 3:42:27.820
 And I'm in the very much the privileged position

3:42:27.820 --> 3:42:31.340
 of I'm more or less untouchable there

3:42:31.340 --> 3:42:33.340
 where I've been dinged like twice

3:42:33.340 --> 3:42:35.740
 for it's like you said something insensitive in that post

3:42:35.740 --> 3:42:38.940
 and you should probably not say that.

3:42:38.940 --> 3:42:42.340
 But for the most part, yes, I get away with,

3:42:42.340 --> 3:42:45.060
 every week I'm posting something pretty loud

3:42:45.060 --> 3:42:47.500
 and opinionated internally.

3:42:47.500 --> 3:42:50.220
 And I think that's useful for the company,

3:42:50.220 --> 3:42:54.880
 but yeah, it's rare to have a position like that.

3:42:54.880 --> 3:42:56.620
 And I can't necessarily offer advice

3:42:56.620 --> 3:42:59.060
 for how someone can do that.

3:42:59.060 --> 3:43:01.540
 Well, you could offer advice to a company in general

3:43:01.540 --> 3:43:06.060
 to give a little bit of freedom for the young wild,

3:43:06.060 --> 3:43:09.680
 like the wildest ideas come from the young minds.

3:43:10.740 --> 3:43:13.060
 And so you need to give the young minds freedom

3:43:13.060 --> 3:43:16.420
 to think big and wild and crazy.

3:43:16.420 --> 3:43:18.580
 And for that, they have to be opinionated.

3:43:18.580 --> 3:43:23.580
 They have to think crazy ideas and thoughts

3:43:24.380 --> 3:43:26.300
 and pursue them with a full passion

3:43:26.300 --> 3:43:29.220
 without being slowed down by bureaucracy or managers

3:43:29.220 --> 3:43:31.100
 and all that kind of stuff.

3:43:31.100 --> 3:43:33.060
 Obviously startups really empower that,

3:43:33.060 --> 3:43:34.260
 but big companies could too.

3:43:34.260 --> 3:43:37.960
 And that's a design challenge for big companies

3:43:37.960 --> 3:43:40.180
 to see how can you enable that?

3:43:40.180 --> 3:43:41.020
 How can you empower that?

3:43:41.020 --> 3:43:41.840
 Yeah, because the big company,

3:43:41.840 --> 3:43:43.600
 there are so many resources there.

3:43:43.600 --> 3:43:46.580
 And they do, amazing things do get accomplished,

3:43:46.580 --> 3:43:49.780
 but there's so much more that could come out of that.

3:43:49.780 --> 3:43:51.540
 And I'm always hopeful.

3:43:51.540 --> 3:43:53.220
 I'm an optimist in almost everything.

3:43:53.220 --> 3:43:54.980
 I think things can get better.

3:43:54.980 --> 3:43:56.780
 I think that they can improve things

3:43:56.780 --> 3:43:58.340
 that you go through a path

3:43:58.340 --> 3:44:01.420
 and you're learning kind of what does and doesn't work.

3:44:01.420 --> 3:44:03.700
 And I'm not ready to be fatalistic

3:44:03.700 --> 3:44:06.820
 about the kind of the outcome of any of that.

3:44:06.820 --> 3:44:09.040
 Me neither, I know too many good people

3:44:09.040 --> 3:44:12.420
 inside of those large companies that are incredible.

3:44:12.420 --> 3:44:16.060
 You have a friendship with Elon Musk.

3:44:16.060 --> 3:44:17.380
 Often when I talk to him,

3:44:17.380 --> 3:44:19.660
 he'll bring up how incredible of an engineer

3:44:19.660 --> 3:44:22.420
 and just a big picture thinker you are.

3:44:22.420 --> 3:44:26.300
 His huge amount of respect for you.

3:44:26.300 --> 3:44:28.900
 I just, I've never been a fly in the wall

3:44:28.900 --> 3:44:30.600
 between a discussion between the two of you.

3:44:30.600 --> 3:44:34.940
 I just wonder, is there something you guys debate,

3:44:34.940 --> 3:44:36.800
 argue about, discuss?

3:44:36.800 --> 3:44:38.300
 Is there some interesting problems

3:44:38.300 --> 3:44:41.260
 that the two of you think about?

3:44:41.260 --> 3:44:42.480
 You come from different worlds.

3:44:42.480 --> 3:44:45.900
 Maybe there's some intersection in aerospace.

3:44:45.900 --> 3:44:48.160
 Maybe there's some intersection

3:44:48.160 --> 3:44:52.020
 in your new efforts in artificial intelligence

3:44:52.020 --> 3:44:53.580
 in terms of thinking.

3:44:53.580 --> 3:44:55.140
 Is there something interesting you could say

3:44:55.140 --> 3:44:57.340
 about sort of the debates the two of you have?

3:44:57.340 --> 3:44:58.860
 So I think in some ways,

3:44:58.860 --> 3:45:01.300
 we do have a kind of similar background

3:45:01.300 --> 3:45:03.540
 where we're almost exactly the same age.

3:45:03.540 --> 3:45:06.420
 And we had kind of similar programming backgrounds

3:45:06.420 --> 3:45:07.820
 on the personal computers

3:45:07.820 --> 3:45:10.660
 and even some of the books that we would read

3:45:10.660 --> 3:45:13.100
 and things that would kind of turn us into the people

3:45:13.100 --> 3:45:14.700
 that we are today.

3:45:14.700 --> 3:45:19.700
 And I think there is a degree of sensibility similarities

3:45:19.700 --> 3:45:22.940
 where we kind of call bullshit on the same things

3:45:22.940 --> 3:45:25.820
 and kind of see the same opportunities

3:45:25.820 --> 3:45:27.220
 in different technology.

3:45:27.220 --> 3:45:29.020
 And there's that sense of,

3:45:29.020 --> 3:45:31.600
 I always talk about the speed of light solutions for things.

3:45:31.600 --> 3:45:34.920
 And he's thinking about kind of minimum manufacturing

3:45:34.920 --> 3:45:39.020
 and engineering and operational standpoints for things.

3:45:39.020 --> 3:45:42.260
 And so, I mean, I first met Elon

3:45:42.260 --> 3:45:44.080
 right at the start of the aerospace era

3:45:44.080 --> 3:45:46.220
 where I wasn't familiar with,

3:45:46.220 --> 3:45:47.780
 I was still in my game dev bubble.

3:45:47.780 --> 3:45:49.860
 I really wasn't familiar with all the startups

3:45:49.860 --> 3:45:52.080
 that were going and being successful

3:45:52.080 --> 3:45:53.700
 and what went on with PayPal

3:45:53.700 --> 3:45:54.980
 and all of his different companies.

3:45:54.980 --> 3:45:58.900
 But I met him as I was starting to do armadillo aerospace.

3:45:58.900 --> 3:46:03.140
 And he came down with kind of his right hand propulsion guy.

3:46:03.140 --> 3:46:05.460
 And we talked about rockets.

3:46:05.460 --> 3:46:07.280
 What can we do with this?

3:46:07.280 --> 3:46:09.100
 And it was kind of specific things

3:46:09.100 --> 3:46:12.140
 about like how are our flight computers set up?

3:46:12.140 --> 3:46:14.740
 What are different propellant options?

3:46:14.740 --> 3:46:17.580
 You know, what can happen with different ways

3:46:17.580 --> 3:46:19.380
 of putting things together?

3:46:19.380 --> 3:46:21.220
 And then in some ways,

3:46:21.220 --> 3:46:22.900
 he was certainly the biggest player

3:46:22.900 --> 3:46:24.900
 in the sort of alt space community

3:46:24.900 --> 3:46:28.080
 that was going on in the early 2000s.

3:46:28.080 --> 3:46:30.600
 He was the most well funded,

3:46:30.600 --> 3:46:32.860
 although his funding in the larger scheme of things

3:46:32.860 --> 3:46:36.780
 compared to like a NASA or something like that

3:46:36.780 --> 3:46:38.260
 was really tiny.

3:46:38.260 --> 3:46:40.520
 It was a lot more than I had at the time.

3:46:40.520 --> 3:46:42.640
 But it was interesting.

3:46:42.640 --> 3:46:45.560
 I had a point years later when I realized,

3:46:45.560 --> 3:46:48.880
 okay, my financial resources at this point

3:46:48.880 --> 3:46:50.480
 are basically what Elon's was

3:46:50.480 --> 3:46:54.360
 when he went all in on SpaceX and Tesla.

3:46:54.360 --> 3:46:58.360
 And there's, I think in many corners,

3:46:58.360 --> 3:47:01.120
 he does not get the respect that he should

3:47:01.120 --> 3:47:04.960
 about being a wealthy person that could just retire.

3:47:04.960 --> 3:47:08.720
 And he went all in where he was really going to,

3:47:08.720 --> 3:47:11.400
 he could have gone bust.

3:47:11.400 --> 3:47:12.560
 And there's plenty of people,

3:47:12.560 --> 3:47:16.780
 you'd look at the sad athletes or entertainers

3:47:16.780 --> 3:47:18.600
 that had all the money in the world and blew it.

3:47:18.600 --> 3:47:22.400
 And he could have been the business case example of that.

3:47:22.400 --> 3:47:25.440
 But the things that he was doing,

3:47:25.440 --> 3:47:29.880
 space exploration, electrification of transportation,

3:47:29.880 --> 3:47:31.720
 solar city type things,

3:47:31.720 --> 3:47:34.560
 these are big world level things.

3:47:34.560 --> 3:47:36.800
 And I have a great deal of admiration

3:47:36.800 --> 3:47:40.120
 that he was willing to throw himself so completely

3:47:40.120 --> 3:47:43.080
 into that because in contrast with myself,

3:47:43.080 --> 3:47:47.000
 I was doing armadillo aerospace with this tightly bounded,

3:47:47.000 --> 3:47:49.560
 it was John's crazy money at the time

3:47:49.560 --> 3:47:51.440
 that had a finite limit on it.

3:47:51.440 --> 3:47:54.840
 It was never going to impact me or my family

3:47:54.840 --> 3:47:56.560
 if it completely failed.

3:47:56.560 --> 3:47:58.680
 And I was still hedging my bets,

3:47:58.680 --> 3:48:01.060
 working at id Software at the time

3:48:01.060 --> 3:48:04.960
 when he had been really all in there.

3:48:04.960 --> 3:48:08.000
 And I have a huge amount of respect for that.

3:48:08.000 --> 3:48:09.360
 And people do not,

3:48:09.360 --> 3:48:11.480
 the other thing I get irritated with is people that say,

3:48:11.480 --> 3:48:13.880
 it's like, oh, Elon's just a business guy.

3:48:13.880 --> 3:48:16.500
 He just got like, he was gifted the money

3:48:16.500 --> 3:48:19.440
 and he's just kind of investing in all of this

3:48:19.440 --> 3:48:22.240
 when he was really deeply involved

3:48:22.240 --> 3:48:24.520
 in a lot of the decisions.

3:48:24.520 --> 3:48:25.800
 Not all of them were perfect,

3:48:25.800 --> 3:48:30.380
 but he cared very much about engine material selection,

3:48:30.380 --> 3:48:31.660
 propellant selection.

3:48:31.660 --> 3:48:34.320
 And for years he'd be kind of telling me,

3:48:34.320 --> 3:48:37.000
 it's like, get off that hydrogen peroxide stuff.

3:48:37.000 --> 3:48:40.860
 It's like, liquid oxygen is the only proper oxidizer

3:48:40.860 --> 3:48:41.840
 for this.

3:48:41.840 --> 3:48:46.160
 And the times that I've gone through the factories

3:48:46.160 --> 3:48:49.780
 with him, we're talking very detailed things

3:48:49.780 --> 3:48:51.840
 about like how this weld is made,

3:48:51.840 --> 3:48:54.720
 how this sub assembly goes together,

3:48:54.720 --> 3:48:57.560
 what are like startup shut down behaviors

3:48:57.560 --> 3:48:58.520
 of the different things.

3:48:58.520 --> 3:49:03.440
 So he is really in there at a very detailed level.

3:49:03.440 --> 3:49:06.960
 And I think that he is the best modern example now

3:49:06.960 --> 3:49:08.520
 of someone that tries to,

3:49:08.520 --> 3:49:11.880
 that can effectively micromanage some decisions on things

3:49:11.880 --> 3:49:15.040
 on both Tesla and SpaceX to some degree

3:49:15.040 --> 3:49:16.920
 where he cares enough about it.

3:49:16.920 --> 3:49:19.280
 I worry a lot that he stretched too thin

3:49:19.280 --> 3:49:23.000
 that you get Boring Company and Neuralink and Twitter

3:49:23.000 --> 3:49:25.280
 and all the other possible things there

3:49:25.280 --> 3:49:30.000
 where I know I've got limits on how much I can pay attention

3:49:30.000 --> 3:49:34.040
 to that I have to kind of box off different amounts of time.

3:49:34.040 --> 3:49:36.440
 And I look back at like at my aerospace side of things,

3:49:36.440 --> 3:49:38.400
 it's like, I did not go all in on that.

3:49:38.400 --> 3:49:40.640
 I did not commit myself at a level

3:49:40.640 --> 3:49:43.500
 that it would have taken to be successful there.

3:49:43.500 --> 3:49:46.440
 And I, yeah, and it's kind of a weird thing

3:49:46.440 --> 3:49:49.000
 just like having a discussion with him.

3:49:49.000 --> 3:49:50.840
 He's the richest man in the world right now,

3:49:50.840 --> 3:49:55.840
 but he operates on a level that is still very much

3:49:55.840 --> 3:50:00.160
 in my wheelhouse on a technical side of things.

3:50:00.160 --> 3:50:01.000
 So.

3:50:01.000 --> 3:50:02.440
 That doing that systems level type of thinking

3:50:02.440 --> 3:50:04.880
 where you can go to the low level details

3:50:04.880 --> 3:50:07.420
 and go up high to the big picture.

3:50:07.420 --> 3:50:12.320
 Do you think in aerospace arena

3:50:12.320 --> 3:50:14.480
 in the next five, 10 years,

3:50:14.480 --> 3:50:16.360
 do you think we're gonna put a human on Mars?

3:50:16.360 --> 3:50:18.560
 Like, what do you think is the interesting?

3:50:20.280 --> 3:50:23.040
 No, I do, in fact, I made a bet with someone

3:50:23.040 --> 3:50:24.860
 with a group of people kind of this

3:50:24.860 --> 3:50:28.400
 about whether boots on Mars by 2030.

3:50:28.400 --> 3:50:31.300
 And this was kind of a fun story

3:50:31.300 --> 3:50:34.120
 because I was at an Intel sponsored event

3:50:34.120 --> 3:50:37.380
 and we had a bunch of just world class, brilliant people.

3:50:37.380 --> 3:50:39.120
 And we were talking about computing stuff,

3:50:39.120 --> 3:50:41.520
 but the after dinner conversation was like,

3:50:41.520 --> 3:50:42.340
 what are some other things?

3:50:42.340 --> 3:50:43.920
 How are they gonna go in the future?

3:50:43.920 --> 3:50:46.140
 And one of the ones tossed up on the whiteboard

3:50:46.140 --> 3:50:49.040
 was like boots on Mars by 2030.

3:50:49.040 --> 3:50:52.280
 And most of the people in the room thought, yes,

3:50:52.280 --> 3:50:54.440
 I thought that like, SpaceX is kicking ass.

3:50:54.440 --> 3:50:57.000
 We've got all this possible stuff.

3:50:57.000 --> 3:50:59.440
 Seems likely that it's gonna go that way.

3:50:59.440 --> 3:51:03.280
 And I said, no, I think less than 50% chance

3:51:03.280 --> 3:51:05.440
 that it's going to make it there.

3:51:05.440 --> 3:51:07.320
 And people were kind of like,

3:51:07.320 --> 3:51:09.440
 oh, why the pessimism or whatever?

3:51:09.440 --> 3:51:12.040
 And of course I'm an optimist at almost everything,

3:51:12.040 --> 3:51:14.820
 but for me to be the one kind of outlier saying,

3:51:14.820 --> 3:51:16.160
 no, I don't think so.

3:51:17.240 --> 3:51:19.400
 Then I started saying some of the things I said,

3:51:19.400 --> 3:51:21.040
 well, let's be concrete about it.

3:51:21.040 --> 3:51:24.880
 Let's bet $10,000 that it's not gonna happen.

3:51:24.880 --> 3:51:29.800
 And this was really a startling thing to see that I,

3:51:29.800 --> 3:51:31.640
 again, room full of brilliant people,

3:51:31.640 --> 3:51:34.320
 but as soon as like money came on the line

3:51:34.320 --> 3:51:36.680
 and they were like, do I wanna put 10,000?

3:51:36.680 --> 3:51:38.800
 I was not the richest person in the room.

3:51:38.800 --> 3:51:41.280
 There were people much better off than I was.

3:51:41.280 --> 3:51:45.320
 There's a spectrum, but as soon as they started thinking,

3:51:45.320 --> 3:51:46.760
 it's like, oh, I could lose money

3:51:46.760 --> 3:51:50.760
 by keeping my position right now.

3:51:50.760 --> 3:51:53.400
 And all these engineers, they engaged their brain.

3:51:53.400 --> 3:51:55.120
 They started thinking, it's like, okay,

3:51:55.120 --> 3:51:57.840
 launch windows, launch delays,

3:51:57.840 --> 3:52:00.340
 like how many times would it take to get this right?

3:52:00.340 --> 3:52:02.680
 What historical precedents do we have?

3:52:02.680 --> 3:52:05.800
 And then it mostly came down to, it's like,

3:52:05.800 --> 3:52:08.200
 well, what about in transit by 2030?

3:52:08.200 --> 3:52:11.440
 And then what about different things

3:52:11.440 --> 3:52:13.880
 or would you go for 2032?

3:52:13.880 --> 3:52:15.760
 But one of the people did go ahead

3:52:15.760 --> 3:52:18.300
 and was optimistic enough to make a bet with me.

3:52:18.300 --> 3:52:21.960
 So I have a $10,000 bet that by 2030,

3:52:21.960 --> 3:52:24.400
 I think it's gonna happen shortly thereafter.

3:52:24.400 --> 3:52:26.460
 I think there will probably be infrastructure on Mars

3:52:26.460 --> 3:52:29.960
 by 2030, but I don't think that we'll have humans

3:52:29.960 --> 3:52:31.120
 on Mars on 2030.

3:52:31.120 --> 3:52:33.540
 I think it's possible, but I think it's less

3:52:33.540 --> 3:52:36.720
 than a 50% chance, so I felt safe making that bet.

3:52:36.720 --> 3:52:39.960
 Well, I think you had an interesting point.

3:52:39.960 --> 3:52:41.200
 Correct me if I'm wrong.

3:52:41.200 --> 3:52:42.460
 That's a dark one.

3:52:42.460 --> 3:52:48.800
 That should perhaps help people appreciate Elon Musk,

3:52:48.800 --> 3:52:53.400
 which is, in this particular effort,

3:52:53.400 --> 3:52:56.840
 Elon is critical to the success.

3:52:56.840 --> 3:53:01.840
 SpaceX seems to be critical to, you know,

3:53:03.640 --> 3:53:07.040
 humans on Mars by 2030 or thereabouts.

3:53:07.040 --> 3:53:09.160
 So if something happens to Elon,

3:53:09.160 --> 3:53:12.160
 then all of this collapses.

3:53:12.160 --> 3:53:16.160
 And this is in contrast to the other $10,000 bet

3:53:16.160 --> 3:53:19.160
 I made kind of recently, and that was self driving cars

3:53:19.160 --> 3:53:22.160
 at like a level five running around cities.

3:53:22.160 --> 3:53:24.160
 And people have kind of nitpicked that

3:53:24.160 --> 3:53:26.160
 that we probably don't mean exactly level five,

3:53:26.160 --> 3:53:29.160
 but the guy I'm having the bet with is,

3:53:29.160 --> 3:53:31.160
 we're gonna be, we know what we mean about this.

3:53:31.160 --> 3:53:32.160
 Jeff Atwood.

3:53:32.160 --> 3:53:36.160
 Yeah, coding horror and stack overflow and all.

3:53:36.160 --> 3:53:40.160
 But yeah, I mean, he doesn't think that people

3:53:40.160 --> 3:53:43.160
 are gonna be riding around in robo taxis in 2030

3:53:43.160 --> 3:53:47.160
 in major cities, just like you take an Uber now.

3:53:47.160 --> 3:53:48.160
 And I think it will.

3:53:48.160 --> 3:53:49.160
 You think it will.

3:53:49.160 --> 3:53:51.160
 And the difference is, everybody looks at this,

3:53:51.160 --> 3:53:53.160
 it's like, oh, but Tesla's been wrong for years.

3:53:53.160 --> 3:53:56.160
 They've been promising it for years and it's not here yet.

3:53:56.160 --> 3:54:00.160
 And the reason this is different than the bet with Mars

3:54:00.160 --> 3:54:04.160
 is Mars really is more than is comfortable

3:54:04.160 --> 3:54:06.160
 a bet on Elon Musk.

3:54:06.160 --> 3:54:11.160
 That is his thing and he is really going to move

3:54:11.160 --> 3:54:13.160
 heaven and earth to try to make that happen.

3:54:13.160 --> 3:54:17.160
 And perhaps not even SpaceX, perhaps just Elon Musk.

3:54:17.160 --> 3:54:21.160
 Yeah, because if Elon went away and SpaceX went public

3:54:21.160 --> 3:54:23.160
 and got a board of directors,

3:54:23.160 --> 3:54:26.160
 there are more profitable things they could be doing

3:54:26.160 --> 3:54:29.160
 than focusing on human presence on Mars.

3:54:29.160 --> 3:54:32.160
 So this really is a sort of personal thing there.

3:54:32.160 --> 3:54:36.160
 And in contrast with that, self driving cars

3:54:36.160 --> 3:54:40.160
 have a dozen credible companies working really hard.

3:54:40.160 --> 3:54:43.160
 And while, yes, it's going slower

3:54:43.160 --> 3:54:45.160
 than most people thought it would,

3:54:45.160 --> 3:54:49.160
 betting against that is a bet against almost the entire world

3:54:49.160 --> 3:54:51.160
 in terms of all of these companies

3:54:51.160 --> 3:54:53.160
 that have all of these incentives.

3:54:53.160 --> 3:54:56.160
 It's not just one guy's passion project.

3:54:56.160 --> 3:54:59.160
 And I do think that it is solvable.

3:54:59.160 --> 3:55:02.160
 Although I recognize it's not 100% chance

3:55:02.160 --> 3:55:05.160
 because it's possible the long tail of self driving problems

3:55:05.160 --> 3:55:08.160
 winds up being an AGI complete problem.

3:55:08.160 --> 3:55:11.160
 I think there's plenty of value to mine out of it with narrow AI.

3:55:11.160 --> 3:55:15.160
 And I think that it's going to happen probably more so

3:55:15.160 --> 3:55:16.160
 than people expect.

3:55:16.160 --> 3:55:18.160
 But it's that whole sigmoid curve

3:55:18.160 --> 3:55:21.160
 where you overestimate the near term progress

3:55:21.160 --> 3:55:23.160
 and you underestimate the long term progress.

3:55:23.160 --> 3:55:26.160
 And I think self driving is going to be like that.

3:55:26.160 --> 3:55:29.160
 And I think 2030 is still a pretty good bet.

3:55:29.160 --> 3:55:35.160
 Yeah, unfortunately, self driving is a problem

3:55:35.160 --> 3:55:41.160
 that is safety critical, meaning that if you don't do it well,

3:55:41.160 --> 3:55:43.160
 people get hurt.

3:55:43.160 --> 3:55:46.160
 But the other side of that is people are terrible drivers.

3:55:46.160 --> 3:55:48.160
 So it is not going to be,

3:55:48.160 --> 3:55:50.160
 that's probably going to be the argument that gets it through

3:55:50.160 --> 3:55:54.160
 is like we can save 10,000 lives a year

3:55:54.160 --> 3:55:57.160
 by taking imperfect self driving cars

3:55:57.160 --> 3:56:00.160
 and letting them take over a lot of driving responsibilities.

3:56:00.160 --> 3:56:05.160
 It's like 30,000 people a year die in auto accidents right now in America.

3:56:05.160 --> 3:56:07.160
 And a lot of those are preventable.

3:56:07.160 --> 3:56:09.160
 And the problem is you'll have people that

3:56:09.160 --> 3:56:11.160
 every time a Tesla crashes into something,

3:56:11.160 --> 3:56:14.160
 you've got a bunch of people that literally have vested interests

3:56:14.160 --> 3:56:17.160
 shorting Tesla to come out and make it the worst thing in the world.

3:56:17.160 --> 3:56:19.160
 And people will be fighting against that.

3:56:19.160 --> 3:56:21.160
 But optimist in me again,

3:56:21.160 --> 3:56:26.160
 I think that we will have systems that are statistically safer than human drivers

3:56:26.160 --> 3:56:30.160
 and we will be saving thousands and thousands of lives every year

3:56:30.160 --> 3:56:34.160
 when we can hand over more of those responsibilities to it.

3:56:34.160 --> 3:56:38.160
 I do still think as a person who studied this problem very deeply

3:56:38.160 --> 3:56:40.160
 from a human side as well,

3:56:40.160 --> 3:56:46.160
 it's still an open problem how good slash bad humans are driving.

3:56:46.160 --> 3:56:49.160
 It's a kind of funny thing we say about each other.

3:56:49.160 --> 3:56:51.160
 Oh, humans suck at driving.

3:56:51.160 --> 3:56:54.160
 Everybody except you, of course.

3:56:54.160 --> 3:56:56.160
 Like we think we're good at driving.

3:56:56.160 --> 3:56:59.160
 But I, after really studying it,

3:56:59.160 --> 3:57:03.160
 I think you start to notice, you know,

3:57:03.160 --> 3:57:06.160
 because I watched hundreds of hours of humans driving

3:57:06.160 --> 3:57:08.160
 with the projects of this kind of thing.

3:57:08.160 --> 3:57:11.160
 You've noticed that even with the distraction,

3:57:11.160 --> 3:57:13.160
 even with everything else,

3:57:13.160 --> 3:57:17.160
 humans are able to do some incredible things

3:57:17.160 --> 3:57:19.160
 with the attention,

3:57:19.160 --> 3:57:21.160
 even when you're just looking at the smartphone,

3:57:21.160 --> 3:57:23.160
 just to get cues from the environment

3:57:23.160 --> 3:57:26.160
 to make last second decisions,

3:57:26.160 --> 3:57:30.160
 to use instinctual type of decisions that actually save your ass

3:57:30.160 --> 3:57:32.160
 time and time and time again.

3:57:32.160 --> 3:57:37.160
 And are able to do that with so much uncertainty around you

3:57:37.160 --> 3:57:40.160
 in such tricky dynamic environments.

3:57:40.160 --> 3:57:42.160
 I don't know.

3:57:42.160 --> 3:57:49.160
 I don't know exactly how hard is it to beat that kind of skill

3:57:49.160 --> 3:57:51.160
 of common sense reasoning.

3:57:51.160 --> 3:57:53.160
 This is one of those interesting things that there have been

3:57:53.160 --> 3:57:56.160
 a lot of studies about how experts in their field

3:57:56.160 --> 3:57:59.160
 usually underestimate the progress that's going to happen

3:57:59.160 --> 3:58:02.160
 because an expert thinks about all the problems they deal with

3:58:02.160 --> 3:58:05.160
 and they're like, damn, I'm going to have a hard time

3:58:05.160 --> 3:58:06.160
 solving all of this.

3:58:06.160 --> 3:58:08.160
 And they filter out the fact that they are one expert

3:58:08.160 --> 3:58:10.160
 in a field of thousands.

3:58:10.160 --> 3:58:13.160
 And you think about, yeah, I can't do all of that.

3:58:13.160 --> 3:58:16.160
 And you sometimes forget about the scope of the ecosystem

3:58:16.160 --> 3:58:18.160
 that you're embedded in.

3:58:18.160 --> 3:58:20.160
 And if you think back eight years, very specifically,

3:58:20.160 --> 3:58:23.160
 the state of AI and machine learning, where was that?

3:58:23.160 --> 3:58:26.160
 We had just gotten Resnets probably at that point.

3:58:26.160 --> 3:58:29.160
 And you look at all the amazing magical things

3:58:29.160 --> 3:58:31.160
 that have happened in eight years,

3:58:31.160 --> 3:58:34.160
 and they do kind of seem to be happening a little faster

3:58:34.160 --> 3:58:36.160
 in recent years also.

3:58:36.160 --> 3:58:39.160
 And you project that eight more years into the future,

3:58:39.160 --> 3:58:41.160
 where, again, I think there's a 50% chance

3:58:41.160 --> 3:58:43.160
 we're going to have signs of life of AGI,

3:58:43.160 --> 3:58:46.160
 which we can put through driver's ed if we need to

3:58:46.160 --> 3:58:48.160
 to actually build self driving cars.

3:58:48.160 --> 3:58:51.160
 And I think that the narrow systems are going to have

3:58:51.160 --> 3:58:54.160
 real value demonstrated well before then.

3:58:54.160 --> 3:59:00.160
 So signs of life in AGI, you've mentioned that,

3:59:00.160 --> 3:59:04.160
 okay, first of all, you're one of the most brilliant people

3:59:04.160 --> 3:59:05.160
 on this earth.

3:59:05.160 --> 3:59:08.160
 You could be solving a number of different problems,

3:59:08.160 --> 3:59:09.160
 as you've mentioned.

3:59:09.160 --> 3:59:12.160
 Your mind was attracted to nuclear energy.

3:59:12.160 --> 3:59:14.160
 Obviously, virtual reality with the metaverse

3:59:14.160 --> 3:59:16.160
 is something you could have a tremendous impact on.

3:59:16.160 --> 3:59:19.160
 So I do want to say a quick thing about nuclear energy,

3:59:19.160 --> 3:59:25.160
 where this is something that so precisely feels like

3:59:25.160 --> 3:59:29.160
 aerospace before SpaceX, where from everything that I know

3:59:29.160 --> 3:59:33.160
 about all of these, the physics of this stuff hasn't changed.

3:59:33.160 --> 3:59:36.160
 And the reasons why things are expensive now

3:59:36.160 --> 3:59:38.160
 are not fundamental.

3:59:38.160 --> 3:59:44.160
 Somebody should be going into a really hard Elon Musk style

3:59:44.160 --> 3:59:48.160
 at fission, economical fission, not fusion,

3:59:48.160 --> 3:59:52.160
 where the fusion is the kind of the darling of people

3:59:52.160 --> 3:59:55.160
 that want to go and do nuclear because it doesn't have

3:59:55.160 --> 3:59:58.160
 the taint that fission has in a lot of people's minds.

3:59:58.160 --> 4:00:03.160
 But it's an almost absurdly complex thing where nuclear fusion,

4:00:03.160 --> 4:00:06.160
 as you look at the tokamaks or any of the things that people

4:00:06.160 --> 4:00:09.160
 are building, and it's doing all of this infrastructure

4:00:09.160 --> 4:00:12.160
 just at the end of the day to make something hot

4:00:12.160 --> 4:00:14.160
 that you can then turn into energy

4:00:14.160 --> 4:00:16.160
 through a conventional power plant.

4:00:16.160 --> 4:00:18.160
 And all of that work, which we think

4:00:18.160 --> 4:00:21.160
 we've got line of sight on, but even if it comes out,

4:00:21.160 --> 4:00:25.160
 then you have to do all of that immensely complex expensive

4:00:25.160 --> 4:00:28.160
 stuff just to make something hot, where nuclear fission

4:00:28.160 --> 4:00:30.160
 is basically you put these two rocks together

4:00:30.160 --> 4:00:32.160
 and they get hot all by themselves.

4:00:32.160 --> 4:00:35.160
 That is just that much simpler.

4:00:35.160 --> 4:00:37.160
 It's just orders of magnitude simpler.

4:00:37.160 --> 4:00:40.160
 And the actual rocks, the refined uranium,

4:00:40.160 --> 4:00:41.160
 is not very expensive.

4:00:41.160 --> 4:00:44.160
 It's a couple percent of the cost of electricity.

4:00:44.160 --> 4:00:47.160
 That's why I made that point where you could have something

4:00:47.160 --> 4:00:51.160
 which was five times less efficient than current systems.

4:00:51.160 --> 4:00:54.160
 And if the rest of the plant was a whole bunch cheaper,

4:00:54.160 --> 4:00:56.160
 you could still be super, super valuable.

4:00:56.160 --> 4:01:02.160
 So how much of the pie do you think could be solved

4:01:02.160 --> 4:01:04.160
 by nuclear energy by fission?

4:01:04.160 --> 4:01:07.160
 So how much could it become the primary source

4:01:07.160 --> 4:01:08.160
 of energy on Earth?

4:01:08.160 --> 4:01:10.160
 It could be most of it.

4:01:10.160 --> 4:01:12.160
 Like the reserves of uranium, as it stands now,

4:01:12.160 --> 4:01:13.160
 could not power the whole Earth.

4:01:13.160 --> 4:01:16.160
 But you get into breeder reactors and thorium

4:01:16.160 --> 4:01:19.160
 and things like that that you do for conventional fission.

4:01:19.160 --> 4:01:22.160
 There is enough for everything.

4:01:22.160 --> 4:01:25.160
 Now, I mean, solar, photovoltaic has been amazing.

4:01:25.160 --> 4:01:29.160
 One of my current projects is working on an off grid system.

4:01:29.160 --> 4:01:31.160
 And it's been fun just kind of, again, putting my hands

4:01:31.160 --> 4:01:34.160
 on all this, stripping the wires and wiring things together

4:01:34.160 --> 4:01:35.160
 and doing all of that.

4:01:35.160 --> 4:01:37.160
 And just having followed that a little bit

4:01:37.160 --> 4:01:40.160
 from the outside over the last couple decades,

4:01:40.160 --> 4:01:43.160
 there's been semiconductor like magical progress

4:01:43.160 --> 4:01:45.160
 in what's going on there.

4:01:45.160 --> 4:01:47.160
 So I'm all for all of that.

4:01:47.160 --> 4:01:49.160
 But it doesn't solve everything.

4:01:49.160 --> 4:01:52.160
 And nuclear really still does seem like the smart money

4:01:52.160 --> 4:01:55.160
 bet for what you should be getting for baseband

4:01:55.160 --> 4:01:56.160
 on a lot of things.

4:01:56.160 --> 4:02:00.160
 And solar may be cheaper for peaking over air conditioning

4:02:00.160 --> 4:02:02.160
 loads during the summer and things

4:02:02.160 --> 4:02:05.160
 that you can push around in different ways.

4:02:05.160 --> 4:02:07.160
 But it's one of those things that's

4:02:07.160 --> 4:02:10.160
 it's just strange how we've had the technology sitting there.

4:02:10.160 --> 4:02:14.160
 But these non technical reasons on the social optics of it

4:02:14.160 --> 4:02:18.160
 has been this major forcing function for something

4:02:18.160 --> 4:02:21.160
 that really should be at the cornerstone of all

4:02:21.160 --> 4:02:23.160
 of the world's concerns with energy.

4:02:23.160 --> 4:02:27.160
 It's interesting how the non technical factors have really

4:02:27.160 --> 4:02:31.160
 dominated something that is so fundamental to the existence

4:02:31.160 --> 4:02:34.160
 of the human race as we know it today.

4:02:34.160 --> 4:02:36.160
 And much of the troubles of the world,

4:02:36.160 --> 4:02:40.160
 including wars in different parts of the world like Ukraine

4:02:40.160 --> 4:02:41.160
 is energy based.

4:02:41.160 --> 4:02:47.160
 And yeah, it's just sitting right there to be solved.

4:02:47.160 --> 4:02:50.160
 That said, I mean, to me personally,

4:02:50.160 --> 4:02:53.160
 I think it's clear that if AGI were to be achieved,

4:02:53.160 --> 4:02:55.160
 that would change the course of human history.

4:02:55.160 --> 4:03:00.160
 So AGI wise, I was making this decision about what

4:03:00.160 --> 4:03:03.160
 do I want to focus on after VR.

4:03:03.160 --> 4:03:06.160
 And I'm still working on VR regularly.

4:03:06.160 --> 4:03:09.160
 I spend a day a week kind of consulting with Meta.

4:03:09.160 --> 4:03:13.160
 And Boz styles me the consulting CTO.

4:03:13.160 --> 4:03:15.160
 It's kind of like the Sherlock Holmes that

4:03:15.160 --> 4:03:18.160
 comes in and consults on some of the specific tough issues.

4:03:18.160 --> 4:03:21.160
 And I'm still pretty passionate about all of that.

4:03:21.160 --> 4:03:25.160
 But I have been figuring out how to compartmentalize and force

4:03:25.160 --> 4:03:29.160
 that into a smaller box to work on some other things.

4:03:29.160 --> 4:03:30.160
 And I did come down to this decision

4:03:30.160 --> 4:03:34.160
 between working on economical nuclear fission

4:03:34.160 --> 4:03:36.160
 or artificial general intelligence.

4:03:36.160 --> 4:03:39.160
 And the fission side of things, I've

4:03:39.160 --> 4:03:42.160
 got a bunch of interesting things going that way.

4:03:42.160 --> 4:03:46.160
 But that would be a fairly big project thing to do.

4:03:46.160 --> 4:03:49.160
 I don't think it needs to be as big as people expect.

4:03:49.160 --> 4:03:53.160
 I do think something original SpaceX sized, you build it,

4:03:53.160 --> 4:03:56.160
 power your building off of it, and then the government,

4:03:56.160 --> 4:03:59.160
 I think, will come around to what you need to.

4:03:59.160 --> 4:04:01.160
 Everybody loves an existence proof.

4:04:01.160 --> 4:04:03.160
 I think it's possible somebody should be doing this.

4:04:03.160 --> 4:04:05.160
 But it's going to involve some politics.

4:04:05.160 --> 4:04:07.160
 It's going to involve decent sized teams

4:04:07.160 --> 4:04:09.160
 and a bunch of this cross functional stuff

4:04:09.160 --> 4:04:11.160
 that I don't love.

4:04:11.160 --> 4:04:15.160
 While the artificial general intelligence side of things,

4:04:15.160 --> 4:04:21.160
 it seems to me like this is the highest leverage

4:04:21.160 --> 4:04:24.160
 moment for potentially a single individual,

4:04:24.160 --> 4:04:26.160
 potentially in the history of the world,

4:04:26.160 --> 4:04:30.160
 where the things that we know about the brain, about what we

4:04:30.160 --> 4:04:33.160
 can do with artificial intelligence,

4:04:33.160 --> 4:04:36.160
 nobody can say absolutely on any of these things.

4:04:36.160 --> 4:04:40.160
 But I am not a madman for saying that it is likely

4:04:40.160 --> 4:04:44.160
 that the code for artificial general intelligence

4:04:44.160 --> 4:04:48.160
 is going to be tens of thousands of lines of code,

4:04:48.160 --> 4:04:50.160
 not millions of lines of code.

4:04:50.160 --> 4:04:53.160
 This is code that conceivably one individual could write,

4:04:53.160 --> 4:04:57.160
 unlike writing a new web browser or operating system.

4:04:57.160 --> 4:05:01.160
 And based on the progress that AI, machine learning,

4:05:01.160 --> 4:05:04.160
 has made in the recent decade, it's

4:05:04.160 --> 4:05:07.160
 likely that the important things that we don't know

4:05:07.160 --> 4:05:09.160
 are relatively simple.

4:05:09.160 --> 4:05:11.160
 There's probably a handful of things.

4:05:11.160 --> 4:05:16.160
 My bet is that I think there's less than six key insights that

4:05:16.160 --> 4:05:17.160
 need to be made.

4:05:17.160 --> 4:05:19.160
 Each one of them can probably be written

4:05:19.160 --> 4:05:20.160
 on the back of an envelope.

4:05:20.160 --> 4:05:22.160
 We don't know what they are.

4:05:22.160 --> 4:05:26.160
 But when they're put together in concert with GPUs at scale

4:05:26.160 --> 4:05:28.160
 and the data that we all have access to,

4:05:28.160 --> 4:05:32.160
 that we can make something that behaves like a human being

4:05:32.160 --> 4:05:35.160
 or like a living creature and that can then

4:05:35.160 --> 4:05:39.160
 be educated in whatever ways that we need to get to the point

4:05:39.160 --> 4:05:43.160
 where we can have universal remote workers where anything

4:05:43.160 --> 4:05:45.160
 that somebody does mediated by a computer

4:05:45.160 --> 4:05:49.160
 and doesn't require physical interaction that an AGI will

4:05:49.160 --> 4:05:50.160
 be able to do.

4:05:50.160 --> 4:05:54.160
 We can already simulate the equivalent of the Zoom meetings

4:05:54.160 --> 4:05:58.160
 with avatars and synthetic deep fakes and whatnot.

4:05:58.160 --> 4:06:00.160
 We can definitely do that.

4:06:00.160 --> 4:06:03.160
 We have superhuman capabilities on any narrow thing

4:06:03.160 --> 4:06:07.160
 that we can formalize and make a loss function for.

4:06:07.160 --> 4:06:10.160
 But there's things we don't know how to do now.

4:06:10.160 --> 4:06:13.160
 But I don't think they are unapproachably hard.

4:06:13.160 --> 4:06:16.160
 Now, that's incredibly hubristic to say that it's like,

4:06:16.160 --> 4:06:19.160
 but I think that what I said a couple years ago

4:06:19.160 --> 4:06:23.160
 is a 50% chance that somewhere there will be signs of life

4:06:23.160 --> 4:06:25.160
 of AGI in 2030.

4:06:25.160 --> 4:06:27.160
 And I've probably increased that slightly.

4:06:27.160 --> 4:06:30.160
 I may be at 55%, 60% now because I

4:06:30.160 --> 4:06:34.160
 do think there's a little sense of acceleration there.

4:06:34.160 --> 4:06:36.160
 So I wonder what the, and by the way,

4:06:36.160 --> 4:06:39.160
 you also written that I bet with hindsight

4:06:39.160 --> 4:06:42.160
 we will find that clear antecedents of all

4:06:42.160 --> 4:06:44.160
 the critical remaining steps for AGI

4:06:44.160 --> 4:06:48.160
 are already buried somewhere in the vast literature of today.

4:06:48.160 --> 4:06:50.160
 So the ideas are already there.

4:06:50.160 --> 4:06:52.160
 I think that's likely the case.

4:06:52.160 --> 4:06:54.160
 One of the things that appeals to so many people,

4:06:54.160 --> 4:06:56.160
 including me, about the promise of AGI

4:06:56.160 --> 4:06:59.160
 is we know that we're only drinking

4:06:59.160 --> 4:07:03.160
 from a straw from the fire hose of all the information out there.

4:07:03.160 --> 4:07:07.160
 I mean, you look at just in a very narrowly bounded field

4:07:07.160 --> 4:07:10.160
 like machine learning, like you can't read all the papers that

4:07:10.160 --> 4:07:11.160
 come out all the time.

4:07:11.160 --> 4:07:14.160
 You can't go back and read all the clever things

4:07:14.160 --> 4:07:16.160
 that people did in the 90s or earlier

4:07:16.160 --> 4:07:18.160
 that people have forgotten about because they didn't pan out

4:07:18.160 --> 4:07:22.160
 at the time when they were trying to do them with 12 neurons.

4:07:22.160 --> 4:07:25.160
 So this idea that, yeah, I think there

4:07:25.160 --> 4:07:29.160
 are gems buried in some of the older literature that was not

4:07:29.160 --> 4:07:31.160
 the path taken by everything.

4:07:31.160 --> 4:07:34.160
 And you can see a herd mentality on the things that

4:07:34.160 --> 4:07:35.160
 happen right now.

4:07:35.160 --> 4:07:36.160
 It's almost funny to see.

4:07:36.160 --> 4:07:38.160
 It's like, oh, Google does something,

4:07:38.160 --> 4:07:41.160
 and OpenAI does something, Meta does something.

4:07:41.160 --> 4:07:43.160
 They're the same people that all talk to each other,

4:07:43.160 --> 4:07:45.160
 and they're all one upping each other,

4:07:45.160 --> 4:07:47.160
 and they're all capable of implementing

4:07:47.160 --> 4:07:49.160
 each other's work given a month or two

4:07:49.160 --> 4:07:52.160
 after somebody has an announcement of that.

4:07:52.160 --> 4:07:55.160
 But there's a whole world of possible approaches

4:07:55.160 --> 4:07:57.160
 to machine learning.

4:07:57.160 --> 4:08:00.160
 And I think that we probably will, in hindsight,

4:08:00.160 --> 4:08:03.160
 go back and see it's like, yeah, that was kind of clearly

4:08:03.160 --> 4:08:06.160
 predicted by this early paper here.

4:08:06.160 --> 4:08:08.160
 And this turns out that if you do this and this

4:08:08.160 --> 4:08:11.160
 and take this result from animal training

4:08:11.160 --> 4:08:13.160
 and this thing from neuroscience over here

4:08:13.160 --> 4:08:16.160
 and put it together and set up this curriculum for them

4:08:16.160 --> 4:08:19.160
 to learn in, that that's kind of what it took.

4:08:19.160 --> 4:08:21.160
 You don't have too many people now

4:08:21.160 --> 4:08:23.160
 that are still saying it's not possible

4:08:23.160 --> 4:08:25.160
 or it's going to take hundreds of years.

4:08:25.160 --> 4:08:29.160
 And 10 years ago, you would get a collection of experts,

4:08:29.160 --> 4:08:32.160
 and you would have a decent chunk on the margin that either

4:08:32.160 --> 4:08:35.160
 say not possible or a couple hundred years,

4:08:35.160 --> 4:08:36.160
 might be centuries.

4:08:36.160 --> 4:08:40.160
 And the median estimate would be like 50, 70 years.

4:08:40.160 --> 4:08:41.160
 And it's been coming down.

4:08:41.160 --> 4:08:44.160
 And I know with me saying eight years for something,

4:08:44.160 --> 4:08:46.160
 that still puts me on the optimistic side,

4:08:46.160 --> 4:08:49.160
 but it's not crazy out in the fringes.

4:08:49.160 --> 4:08:52.160
 And just being able to look at that at a meta level

4:08:52.160 --> 4:08:57.160
 about the trend of the predictions going down there,

4:08:57.160 --> 4:09:01.160
 the idea that something could be happening relatively soon.

4:09:01.160 --> 4:09:04.160
 Now, I do not believe in fast takeoffs.

4:09:04.160 --> 4:09:06.160
 That's one of the safety issues that people say,

4:09:06.160 --> 4:09:08.160
 it's like, oh, it's going to go, boom,

4:09:08.160 --> 4:09:10.160
 and the AI is going to take over the world.

4:09:10.160 --> 4:09:12.160
 There's a lot of reasons I don't think

4:09:12.160 --> 4:09:14.160
 that's a credible position.

4:09:14.160 --> 4:09:16.160
 And I think that we will go from a point

4:09:16.160 --> 4:09:20.160
 where we start seeing things that credibly look

4:09:20.160 --> 4:09:22.160
 like animals behaviors.

4:09:22.160 --> 4:09:25.160
 And I have a human voice box wired into them.

4:09:25.160 --> 4:09:27.160
 It's like I tried to get Elon to say,

4:09:27.160 --> 4:09:30.160
 it's like your pig in Neuralink, give it a human voice box

4:09:30.160 --> 4:09:33.160
 and let it start learning human words.

4:09:33.160 --> 4:09:36.160
 I think animal intelligence is closer to human intelligence

4:09:36.160 --> 4:09:38.160
 than a lot of people like to think.

4:09:38.160 --> 4:09:42.160
 And I think that culture and modalities of IO

4:09:42.160 --> 4:09:45.160
 make the Gulf seem a lot bigger than it actually is.

4:09:45.160 --> 4:09:47.160
 There's just that smooth spectrum

4:09:47.160 --> 4:09:51.160
 of how the brain developed and cortexes and scaling

4:09:51.160 --> 4:09:53.160
 of different things going on there.

4:09:53.160 --> 4:09:55.160
 Culture modalities of IO, yes.

4:09:55.160 --> 4:10:00.160
 Language is sort of lost in translation,

4:10:00.160 --> 4:10:03.160
 conceals a lot of intelligence.

4:10:03.160 --> 4:10:06.160
 So when you think about signs of life for AGI,

4:10:06.160 --> 4:10:10.160
 you're thinking about human interpretable signs.

4:10:10.160 --> 4:10:12.160
 So the example I give, if we get to the point

4:10:12.160 --> 4:10:15.160
 where you've got a learning disabled toddler,

4:10:15.160 --> 4:10:18.160
 some kind of real special needs child

4:10:18.160 --> 4:10:20.160
 that can still interact with their favorite TV show

4:10:20.160 --> 4:10:24.160
 and video game and can be trained and learn

4:10:24.160 --> 4:10:26.160
 in some appreciably human like way.

4:10:26.160 --> 4:10:30.160
 At that point, you can deploy an army of engineers,

4:10:30.160 --> 4:10:35.160
 cognitive scientists, developmental education people.

4:10:35.160 --> 4:10:37.160
 And you've got so many advantages there

4:10:37.160 --> 4:10:39.160
 unlike real education where you can do rollbacks

4:10:39.160 --> 4:10:42.160
 and AB testing and you can find a golden path

4:10:42.160 --> 4:10:44.160
 through a curriculum of different things.

4:10:44.160 --> 4:10:47.160
 If you get to that point, learning disabled toddler,

4:10:47.160 --> 4:10:50.160
 I think that it's gonna be a done deal.

4:10:50.160 --> 4:10:53.160
 But do you think we'll know when we see it?

4:10:53.160 --> 4:10:56.160
 So there's been a lot of really interesting

4:10:56.160 --> 4:11:00.160
 general learning progress from DeepMind,

4:11:00.160 --> 4:11:02.160
 OpenAI a little bit too.

4:11:02.160 --> 4:11:06.160
 I tend to believe that Tesla Autopilot

4:11:06.160 --> 4:11:08.160
 deserves a lot more credit than it's getting

4:11:08.160 --> 4:11:12.160
 for making progress on the general,

4:11:12.160 --> 4:11:15.160
 on doing the multitask learning thing

4:11:15.160 --> 4:11:17.160
 and increasing the number of tasks

4:11:17.160 --> 4:11:23.160
 and automating that process of sort of learning

4:11:23.160 --> 4:11:25.160
 from the edge, discovering the edge cases

4:11:25.160 --> 4:11:26.160
 and learning from the edge cases.

4:11:26.160 --> 4:11:30.160
 That is, it's really approaching from a different angle,

4:11:30.160 --> 4:11:33.160
 the general learning problem of AGI.

4:11:33.160 --> 4:11:36.160
 But the more clear approach comes from DeepMind

4:11:36.160 --> 4:11:38.160
 where you have these kind of game situations

4:11:38.160 --> 4:11:41.160
 and you build systems there.

4:11:41.160 --> 4:11:47.160
 But I don't know, people seem to be quite...

4:11:47.160 --> 4:11:50.160
 Yeah, there will always be people that just won't believe it

4:11:50.160 --> 4:11:52.160
 and I fundamentally don't care.

4:11:52.160 --> 4:11:54.160
 I mean, I don't care if they don't believe it.

4:11:54.160 --> 4:11:57.160
 You know, when it starts doing people's jobs

4:11:57.160 --> 4:12:01.160
 and I don't care about the philosophical zombie argument at all.

4:12:01.160 --> 4:12:02.160
 Absolutely.

4:12:02.160 --> 4:12:04.160
 But will you, do you think you will notice

4:12:04.160 --> 4:12:06.160
 that something special has happened here?

4:12:06.160 --> 4:12:12.160
 Because to me, I've been noticing a lot of special things.

4:12:12.160 --> 4:12:18.160
 I think a lot of credit should go to DeepMind for AlphaZero.

4:12:18.160 --> 4:12:20.160
 That was truly special.

4:12:20.160 --> 4:12:24.160
 The self play mechanisms achieve sort of solve problems

4:12:24.160 --> 4:12:28.160
 that used to be thought unsolvable like the game of Go.

4:12:28.160 --> 4:12:32.160
 Also, I mean, protein folding, starting to get into that space

4:12:32.160 --> 4:12:34.160
 where learning is doing...

4:12:34.160 --> 4:12:37.160
 At first there's not, it wasn't end to end learning

4:12:37.160 --> 4:12:41.160
 and now it's end to end learning of a very difficult

4:12:41.160 --> 4:12:45.160
 previously thought unsolvable problem of protein folding.

4:12:45.160 --> 4:12:50.160
 And so, yeah, where do you think

4:12:50.160 --> 4:12:54.160
 would be a really magical moment for you?

4:12:54.160 --> 4:12:57.160
 There have been incredible things happening in recent years.

4:12:57.160 --> 4:13:00.160
 Like you say, all of the things from DeepMind and OpenAI

4:13:00.160 --> 4:13:03.160
 that have been huge showpiece things.

4:13:03.160 --> 4:13:05.160
 But when you really get down to it and you read the papers

4:13:05.160 --> 4:13:08.160
 and you look at the way the models are going,

4:13:08.160 --> 4:13:10.160
 it's still like a feed forward.

4:13:10.160 --> 4:13:13.160
 You push something in, something comes out on the end.

4:13:13.160 --> 4:13:15.160
 I mean, maybe there's diffusion models

4:13:15.160 --> 4:13:18.160
 or Monte Carlo tree rollouts and different things going on,

4:13:18.160 --> 4:13:20.160
 but it's not a being.

4:13:20.160 --> 4:13:22.160
 It's not close to a being.

4:13:22.160 --> 4:13:27.160
 That's going through a lifelong learning process.

4:13:27.160 --> 4:13:31.160
 Do you want something that kind of gives signs of a being?

4:13:31.160 --> 4:13:36.160
 What's the difference between a neural network,

4:13:36.160 --> 4:13:39.160
 a feed forward neural network and a being?

4:13:39.160 --> 4:13:40.160
 Where's the loop?

4:13:40.160 --> 4:13:43.160
 Fundamentally, the brain is a recurrent neural network

4:13:43.160 --> 4:13:45.160
 generating an action policy.

4:13:45.160 --> 4:13:47.160
 I mean, it's implemented on a biological substrate.

4:13:47.160 --> 4:13:49.160
 And it's interesting thinking about things like that

4:13:49.160 --> 4:13:52.160
 where we know fundamentally the brain is not

4:13:52.160 --> 4:13:55.160
 a convolutional neural network or a transformer.

4:13:55.160 --> 4:13:58.160
 Those are specialized things that are very valuable

4:13:58.160 --> 4:14:00.160
 for what we're doing, but it's not the way the brain's doing.

4:14:00.160 --> 4:14:03.160
 Now, I do think consciousness and AI in general

4:14:03.160 --> 4:14:06.160
 is a substrate independent mechanism

4:14:06.160 --> 4:14:09.160
 where it doesn't have to be implemented the way the brain is,

4:14:09.160 --> 4:14:11.160
 but if you've only got one existence proof,

4:14:11.160 --> 4:14:17.160
 there's certainly some value in caring about what it says and does.

4:14:17.160 --> 4:14:21.160
 And so the idea that anything that can be done with a narrow AI

4:14:21.160 --> 4:14:25.160
 that you can quantify up a loss function for or reward mechanism,

4:14:25.160 --> 4:14:28.160
 you're almost certainly going to be able to produce something

4:14:28.160 --> 4:14:31.160
 that's more resource effective to train and deploy

4:14:31.160 --> 4:14:33.160
 and use in an inference mode.

4:14:33.160 --> 4:14:35.160
 You know, train a whole lot using an inference.

4:14:35.160 --> 4:14:39.160
 But a living being is going to be something that's a continuous,

4:14:39.160 --> 4:14:42.160
 lifelong learned task agnostic thing.

4:14:42.160 --> 4:14:46.160
 So the lifelong learning is really important too.

4:14:46.160 --> 4:14:48.160
 And the long term memory.

4:14:48.160 --> 4:14:51.160
 So memory is a big weird part of that puzzle.

4:14:51.160 --> 4:14:55.160
 And we've got, you know, again, I have all the respect in the world

4:14:55.160 --> 4:14:57.160
 for the amazing things that are being done now,

4:14:57.160 --> 4:15:00.160
 but sometimes they can be taken a little bit out of context

4:15:00.160 --> 4:15:04.160
 with things like there's some smoke and mirrors going on,

4:15:04.160 --> 4:15:07.160
 like the Gato, the recent work, the multitask learning stuff.

4:15:07.160 --> 4:15:12.160
 You know, it's amazing that it's one model that plays all the Atari games

4:15:12.160 --> 4:15:14.160
 as well as doing all of these other things.

4:15:14.160 --> 4:15:17.160
 But of course, it didn't learn to do all of those.

4:15:17.160 --> 4:15:21.160
 It was instructed in doing that by other reinforcement learners

4:15:21.160 --> 4:15:23.160
 going through and doing that.

4:15:23.160 --> 4:15:25.160
 And even in the case of all the games,

4:15:25.160 --> 4:15:29.160
 it's still going with a specific hand coded reward function

4:15:29.160 --> 4:15:33.160
 in each of those Atari games where it's not that, you know,

4:15:33.160 --> 4:15:35.160
 it just wants to spend its summer afternoon playing Atari

4:15:35.160 --> 4:15:38.160
 because that's the most interesting thing for it.

4:15:38.160 --> 4:15:42.160
 So it's, again, not a general, it's not learning the way humans learn.

4:15:42.160 --> 4:15:45.160
 And there's, I believe, a lot of things that are challenging

4:15:45.160 --> 4:15:48.160
 to make a loss function for that you can train

4:15:48.160 --> 4:15:51.160
 through these existing conventional things.

4:15:51.160 --> 4:15:54.160
 We're going to chip away at all the things that people do

4:15:54.160 --> 4:15:59.160
 that we can turn into narrow AI problems

4:15:59.160 --> 4:16:02.160
 and billions of, like trillions of dollars of value

4:16:02.160 --> 4:16:04.160
 are going to be created by that.

4:16:04.160 --> 4:16:06.160
 But there's still going to be a set of things

4:16:06.160 --> 4:16:09.160
 and we've got questionable cases like the self driving car

4:16:09.160 --> 4:16:13.160
 where it's possible, it's not my bet, but it's plausible

4:16:13.160 --> 4:16:15.160
 that the long tail could be problematic enough

4:16:15.160 --> 4:16:20.160
 that that really does require a full on artificial general intelligence.

4:16:20.160 --> 4:16:23.160
 The counter argument is that data solves almost everything.

4:16:23.160 --> 4:16:26.160
 There's an interpolation problem if you have enough data

4:16:26.160 --> 4:16:29.160
 and Tesla may be able to get enough data

4:16:29.160 --> 4:16:31.160
 from all of their deployed stuff to be able to work like that,

4:16:31.160 --> 4:16:33.160
 but maybe not.

4:16:33.160 --> 4:16:35.160
 And there are all the other problems about, like,

4:16:35.160 --> 4:16:37.160
 say you want to have a strategy meeting

4:16:37.160 --> 4:16:40.160
 and you want to go ahead and bring in all of your remote workers

4:16:40.160 --> 4:16:43.160
 and your consultants, and you want a world where

4:16:43.160 --> 4:16:48.160
 some of those could be AIs that are talking and interacting with you

4:16:48.160 --> 4:16:52.160
 in an area that is too murky to have a crisp loss function,

4:16:52.160 --> 4:16:54.160
 but they still have things that on some level,

4:16:54.160 --> 4:16:57.160
 they're rewarded on some internal level

4:16:57.160 --> 4:17:01.160
 for building a valuable to humans kind of life

4:17:01.160 --> 4:17:03.160
 and ability to interact with things.

4:17:03.160 --> 4:17:07.160
 See, I still think that self driving cars,

4:17:07.160 --> 4:17:10.160
 solving that problem will take us very far towards AGI.

4:17:10.160 --> 4:17:13.160
 You might not need AGI, but I am really inspired

4:17:13.160 --> 4:17:16.160
 by what Autopilot is doing.

4:17:16.160 --> 4:17:19.160
 Waymo, so some of the other companies,

4:17:19.160 --> 4:17:23.160
 I think Waymo leads the way there is also really interesting,

4:17:23.160 --> 4:17:26.160
 but they don't have quite as ambitious of an effort

4:17:26.160 --> 4:17:32.160
 in terms of learning based sort of data hungry approach to driving,

4:17:32.160 --> 4:17:34.160
 which I think is very close to the kind of thing

4:17:34.160 --> 4:17:37.160
 that would take us far towards AGI.

4:17:37.160 --> 4:17:40.160
 Yeah, and it's a funny thing because as far as I can tell,

4:17:40.160 --> 4:17:44.160
 Elon is completely serious about all of his concerns about AGI

4:17:44.160 --> 4:17:46.160
 being an existential threat.

4:17:46.160 --> 4:17:49.160
 And I tried to draw him out to talk about AGI

4:17:49.160 --> 4:17:50.160
 and he just didn't want to.

4:17:50.160 --> 4:17:54.160
 And I think that I get that little fatalistic sense from him.

4:17:54.160 --> 4:17:58.160
 It's weird because his company could very well be the leading company

4:17:58.160 --> 4:18:03.160
 leading towards a lot of that where Tesla being a super pragmatic company

4:18:03.160 --> 4:18:06.160
 that's doing things because they really want to solve this actual problem.

4:18:06.160 --> 4:18:10.160
 It's a different vibe than the research oriented companies

4:18:10.160 --> 4:18:12.160
 where it's a great time to be an AI researcher.

4:18:12.160 --> 4:18:14.160
 You've got your pick of trillion dollar companies

4:18:14.160 --> 4:18:18.160
 that will pay you to kind of work on the problems you're interested in,

4:18:18.160 --> 4:18:22.160
 but that's not necessarily driving hard towards the core problem

4:18:22.160 --> 4:18:25.160
 of AGI as something that's going to produce a lot of value

4:18:25.160 --> 4:18:30.160
 by doing things that people currently do or would like to do.

4:18:30.160 --> 4:18:35.160
 I mean, I have a million questions to you about your ideas about AGI,

4:18:35.160 --> 4:18:39.160
 but do you think it needs to be embodied?

4:18:39.160 --> 4:18:44.160
 Do you think it needs to have a body to start to notice the signs of life

4:18:44.160 --> 4:18:49.160
 and to develop the kind of system that's able to reason,

4:18:49.160 --> 4:18:53.160
 perceive the world in the way that an AGI should and act in the world?

4:18:53.160 --> 4:18:55.160
 So should we be thinking about robots

4:18:55.160 --> 4:18:58.160
 or can this be achieved in a purely digital system?

4:18:58.160 --> 4:19:01.160
 So I have a clear opinion on that and that's that no,

4:19:01.160 --> 4:19:04.160
 it does not need to be embodied in the physical world

4:19:04.160 --> 4:19:09.160
 where you could say most of my career is about making simulated virtual worlds

4:19:09.160 --> 4:19:11.160
 in games or virtual reality.

4:19:11.160 --> 4:19:13.160
 And so on a fundamental level,

4:19:13.160 --> 4:19:16.160
 I believe that you can make a simulated environment

4:19:16.160 --> 4:19:19.160
 that provides much of the value of what the real environment does

4:19:19.160 --> 4:19:23.160
 and restricting yourself to operating at real time

4:19:23.160 --> 4:19:25.160
 in the physical world with physical objects,

4:19:25.160 --> 4:19:27.160
 I think is an enormous handicap.

4:19:27.160 --> 4:19:31.160
 I mean, that's one of the real lessons driven home by all my aerospace work

4:19:31.160 --> 4:19:36.160
 is that, you know, reality is a bitch in so many ways there

4:19:36.160 --> 4:19:38.160
 where dealing with all the mechanical components,

4:19:38.160 --> 4:19:40.160
 like everything fails, Murphy's law,

4:19:40.160 --> 4:19:42.160
 even if you've done it right before on your fifth one,

4:19:42.160 --> 4:19:44.160
 it might come out differently.

4:19:44.160 --> 4:19:50.160
 So yeah, I think that anybody that is all in on the embodied aspect of it,

4:19:50.160 --> 4:19:53.160
 they are tying a huge weight to their ankles

4:19:53.160 --> 4:19:57.160
 and I think that I would almost count them out,

4:19:57.160 --> 4:20:00.160
 anybody that's making that a cornerstone of their belief about it,

4:20:00.160 --> 4:20:04.160
 I would almost write them off as being worried about them getting to AGI first.

4:20:04.160 --> 4:20:09.160
 I was very surprised that Elon's big on the humanoid robots.

4:20:09.160 --> 4:20:12.160
 I mean, like the NASA Robonaut stuff was almost a gag line,

4:20:12.160 --> 4:20:14.160
 like what are you doing people?

4:20:14.160 --> 4:20:18.160
 Well, that's very interesting because he has a very pragmatic view of that.

4:20:18.160 --> 4:20:23.160
 That's just a way to solve a particular problem in a factory.

4:20:23.160 --> 4:20:26.160
 Now, I do think that once you have an AGI,

4:20:26.160 --> 4:20:29.160
 robotic bodies, humanoid bodies are going to be enormously valuable.

4:20:29.160 --> 4:20:32.160
 I just don't think they're helpful getting to AGI.

4:20:32.160 --> 4:20:37.160
 Well, he has a very sort of practical view, which I disagree with and argue with him,

4:20:37.160 --> 4:20:40.160
 but it's a practical view that there's, you know,

4:20:40.160 --> 4:20:46.160
 you could transfer the problem of driving to the problem of robotic manipulation

4:20:46.160 --> 4:20:49.160
 because so much of it is perception.

4:20:49.160 --> 4:20:53.160
 It's perception and action and it's just a different context

4:20:53.160 --> 4:20:58.160
 and so you can apply all the same kind of data engine learning processes

4:20:58.160 --> 4:20:59.160
 to a different environment.

4:20:59.160 --> 4:21:03.160
 And so why not apply it to the humanoid robot environment?

4:21:03.160 --> 4:21:12.160
 But I think, I do think that there's a certain magic to the embodied robot.

4:21:12.160 --> 4:21:15.160
 That may be the thing that finally convinces people.

4:21:15.160 --> 4:21:18.160
 But again, I don't really care that much about convincing people.

4:21:18.160 --> 4:21:21.160
 You know, the world that I'm looking towards is, you know,

4:21:21.160 --> 4:21:24.160
 you go to the website and say,

4:21:24.160 --> 4:21:29.160
 I want five Frank 1As to work on my team today and they all spin up

4:21:29.160 --> 4:21:31.160
 and they start showing up in your Zoom meetings.

4:21:31.160 --> 4:21:33.160
 To push back, but also to agree with you.

4:21:33.160 --> 4:21:36.160
 But first to push back, I do think you need to convince people

4:21:36.160 --> 4:21:40.160
 for them to welcome that thing into their life.

4:21:40.160 --> 4:21:44.160
 I think there's enough businesses that operate on an objective kind of

4:21:44.160 --> 4:21:48.160
 profit loss sort of basis that, I mean, if you look at how many things,

4:21:48.160 --> 4:21:52.160
 again, talking about the world as an evolutionary space there,

4:21:52.160 --> 4:21:56.160
 when you do have free markets and you have entrepreneurs,

4:21:56.160 --> 4:21:58.160
 you are going to have people that are going to be willing to go out

4:21:58.160 --> 4:22:00.160
 and try whatever crazy things.

4:22:00.160 --> 4:22:03.160
 And when it proves to be beneficial, you know,

4:22:03.160 --> 4:22:05.160
 there's fast followers in all sorts of places.

4:22:05.160 --> 4:22:10.160
 Yeah, and you're saying that, I mean, you know, Quake and VR

4:22:10.160 --> 4:22:13.160
 is a kind of embodiment, but just in a digital world.

4:22:13.160 --> 4:22:17.160
 And if you're able to demonstrate, if you're able to do something

4:22:17.160 --> 4:22:22.160
 productive in that kind of digital reality,

4:22:22.160 --> 4:22:25.160
 then AGI doesn't need to have a body.

4:22:25.160 --> 4:22:28.160
 Yeah, it's like one of the really practical technical questions

4:22:28.160 --> 4:22:31.160
 that I kind of keep arguing with myself over.

4:22:31.160 --> 4:22:34.160
 If you're doing a training and learning and you've got like,

4:22:34.160 --> 4:22:38.160
 you can watch Sesame Street, you can play Master System games or something,

4:22:38.160 --> 4:22:42.160
 is it enough to have just a video feed that is that video coming in?

4:22:42.160 --> 4:22:47.160
 Or should it literally be on a virtual TV set in a virtual room,

4:22:47.160 --> 4:22:50.160
 even if it's, you know, a simple room, just to have that sense of

4:22:50.160 --> 4:22:54.160
 you're looking at a 2D projection on a screen versus having the screen

4:22:54.160 --> 4:22:56.160
 beam directly into your retinas.

4:22:56.160 --> 4:23:00.160
 And, you know, I think it's possible to maybe get past some of these

4:23:00.160 --> 4:23:04.160
 signs of life of things with the just kind of projected directly

4:23:04.160 --> 4:23:09.160
 into the receptor fields, but eventually for more kind of human

4:23:09.160 --> 4:23:14.160
 emotional connection for things, probably having some VR room

4:23:14.160 --> 4:23:18.160
 with a lot of screens in it for the AI to be learning in is likely helpful.

4:23:18.160 --> 4:23:22.160
 It may be a world of different AIs interacting with each other.

4:23:22.160 --> 4:23:24.160
 That self play I do think is one of the critical things where

4:23:24.160 --> 4:23:28.160
 socialization wise, one of the other limitations I set for myself

4:23:28.160 --> 4:23:33.160
 thinking about these is I need something that is at least potentially

4:23:33.160 --> 4:23:37.160
 real time because I want, it's nice you can always slow down time,

4:23:37.160 --> 4:23:42.160
 you can run on a subscale system and test an algorithm at some lower level.

4:23:42.160 --> 4:23:45.160
 And if you've got extra horsepower, running it faster than real time

4:23:45.160 --> 4:23:46.160
 is a great thing.

4:23:46.160 --> 4:23:52.160
 But I want to be able to have the AIs either socially interact with

4:23:52.160 --> 4:23:56.160
 each other or critically with actual people, your sort of child

4:23:56.160 --> 4:24:00.160
 development psychiatrist that comes in and interacts and does the

4:24:00.160 --> 4:24:04.160
 good boy, bad boy sort of thing as they're going through and

4:24:04.160 --> 4:24:05.160
 exploring different things.

4:24:05.160 --> 4:24:10.160
 And it's nice to, I come back to the value of constraints in a lot of ways.

4:24:10.160 --> 4:24:13.160
 And if I say, well, one of my constraints is real time operation.

4:24:13.160 --> 4:24:17.160
 I mean, it might still be a huge data center full of computers,

4:24:17.160 --> 4:24:21.160
 but it should be able to interact on a Zoom meeting with people.

4:24:21.160 --> 4:24:24.160
 And that's how you also do start convincing people, even if it's not

4:24:24.160 --> 4:24:28.160
 a robot body moving around, which eventually gets to irrefutable levels.

4:24:28.160 --> 4:24:33.160
 But if you can go ahead and not just type back and forth to a GPT bot

4:24:33.160 --> 4:24:37.160
 on something, but you're literally talking to them in an embodied

4:24:37.160 --> 4:24:42.160
 over Zoom form and working through problems with them or exploring

4:24:42.160 --> 4:24:46.160
 situations, having conversations that are fully stateful and learned.

4:24:46.160 --> 4:24:49.160
 I think that that's a valuable thing.

4:24:49.160 --> 4:24:54.160
 So I do keep all of my eyes on things that can be implemented within

4:24:54.160 --> 4:24:58.160
 sort of that 30 frames per second kind of work.

4:24:58.160 --> 4:24:59.160
 And I think that's feasible.

4:24:59.160 --> 4:25:03.160
 Do you think the most compelling experiences that first will be

4:25:03.160 --> 4:25:07.160
 for pleasure or for business as they ask in airports?

4:25:07.160 --> 4:25:17.160
 So meaning is if it's interacting with AI agents, will it be sort of

4:25:17.160 --> 4:25:25.160
 like friends, entertainment, almost like a therapist or whatever,

4:25:25.160 --> 4:25:26.160
 that kind of interaction?

4:25:26.160 --> 4:25:30.160
 Or is it in the business setting, something like you said, brainstorming

4:25:30.160 --> 4:25:34.160
 different ideas, sort of this is all a different formulation of kind of

4:25:34.160 --> 4:25:37.160
 a Turing test or the spirit of the original Turing test.

4:25:37.160 --> 4:25:40.160
 Where do you think the biggest benefit will first come?

4:25:40.160 --> 4:25:42.160
 So it's going to start off hugely expensive.

4:25:42.160 --> 4:25:47.160
 I mean, you're going to if we're still all guessing about what compute

4:25:47.160 --> 4:25:48.160
 is going to be necessary.

4:25:48.160 --> 4:25:51.160
 I fall on the side of I don't think you run the numbers and you're like

4:25:51.160 --> 4:25:53.160
 86 billion neurons, 100 trillion synapses.

4:25:53.160 --> 4:25:55.160
 I don't think those all need to be weights.

4:25:55.160 --> 4:25:58.160
 I don't think we need models that are quite that big evaluated quite

4:25:58.160 --> 4:25:59.160
 that often.

4:25:59.160 --> 4:26:03.160
 I based that on we've got reasonable estimates of what some parts of

4:26:03.160 --> 4:26:04.160
 the brain do.

4:26:04.160 --> 4:26:08.160
 We don't have the neocortex formula, but we kind of get some of the

4:26:08.160 --> 4:26:11.160
 other sensory processing and it doesn't feel like we need to.

4:26:11.160 --> 4:26:14.160
 We can simulate that in computers for less weights.

4:26:14.160 --> 4:26:20.160
 But still, it's probably going to be thousands of GPUs to be running

4:26:20.160 --> 4:26:23.160
 a human level AGI, depending on how it's implemented.

4:26:23.160 --> 4:26:28.160
 That might give you sort of a clan of 128 kind of run in batch people,

4:26:28.160 --> 4:26:31.160
 depending on whether there's sparsity in the way that the weights are

4:26:31.160 --> 4:26:32.160
 and things are set up.

4:26:32.160 --> 4:26:36.160
 If it is a reasonably dense thing, then just the memory bandwidth

4:26:36.160 --> 4:26:39.160
 tradeoffs means you get 128 of them at the same time.

4:26:39.160 --> 4:26:43.160
 And either it's all feeding together, learning in parallel or kind of

4:26:43.160 --> 4:26:46.160
 all running together, kind of talking to a bunch of people.

4:26:46.160 --> 4:26:50.160
 But still, if you've got thousands of GPUs necessary to run these

4:26:50.160 --> 4:26:55.160
 things, it's going to be kind of expensive where it might start off

4:26:55.160 --> 4:27:00.160
 $1,000 an hour for even post development or something for that, which

4:27:00.160 --> 4:27:04.160
 would be something that you would only use for a business, something

4:27:04.160 --> 4:27:07.160
 where you think they're going to help you make a strategic decision

4:27:07.160 --> 4:27:09.160
 or point out something super important.

4:27:09.160 --> 4:27:14.160
 But I also am completely confident that we will have another factor

4:27:14.160 --> 4:27:19.160
 of 1,000 in cost performance increase in AGI type calculations.

4:27:19.160 --> 4:27:23.160
 Not in general computing necessarily, but there's so much more that

4:27:23.160 --> 4:27:26.160
 we can do with packaging, making those right tradeoffs, all those

4:27:26.160 --> 4:27:30.160
 same types of things that in the next couple of decades, 1,000 X easy.

4:27:30.160 --> 4:27:32.160
 And then you're down to $1 an hour.

4:27:32.160 --> 4:27:36.160
 And then you're kind of like, well, I should have an entourage of

4:27:36.160 --> 4:27:40.160
 AIs that are following me around, helping me out on anything that

4:27:40.160 --> 4:27:41.160
 I want them to do.

4:27:41.160 --> 4:27:43.160
 That's one interesting trajectory.

4:27:43.160 --> 4:27:50.160
 But I'll push back because I have, so in that case, if you want to

4:27:50.160 --> 4:27:54.160
 pay thousands of dollars, it should actually provide some value.

4:27:54.160 --> 4:28:04.160
 I think it's easier for cheaper to provide value via a dumb AI that

4:28:04.160 --> 4:28:08.160
 will take us towards AGI to just have a friend.

4:28:08.160 --> 4:28:11.160
 I think there's an ocean of loneliness in the world.

4:28:11.160 --> 4:28:16.160
 And I think an effective friend that doesn't have to be perfect,

4:28:16.160 --> 4:28:20.160
 that doesn't have to be intelligent, that has to be empathic,

4:28:20.160 --> 4:28:24.160
 having emotional intelligence, having ability to remember things,

4:28:24.160 --> 4:28:26.160
 having ability to listen.

4:28:26.160 --> 4:28:28.160
 Most of us don't listen to each other.

4:28:28.160 --> 4:28:31.160
 One of the things that love and when you care about somebody,

4:28:31.160 --> 4:28:34.160
 when you love somebody is when you listen.

4:28:34.160 --> 4:28:37.160
 And that is something we treasure about each other.

4:28:37.160 --> 4:28:40.160
 And if an AI can do that kind of thing.

4:28:40.160 --> 4:28:45.160
 I think that provides a huge amount of value and very importantly,

4:28:45.160 --> 4:28:51.160
 provides value in its ability to listen and understand

4:28:51.160 --> 4:28:53.160
 versus provide really good advice.

4:28:53.160 --> 4:28:59.160
 I think providing really good advice is another next level step

4:28:59.160 --> 4:29:05.160
 that I think is just easier to do companionship.

4:29:05.160 --> 4:29:06.160
 Yeah, I wouldn't disagree.

4:29:06.160 --> 4:29:10.160
 I mean, I think that there's very few things that I would argue

4:29:10.160 --> 4:29:14.160
 can't be reduced to some kind of a narrow AI.

4:29:14.160 --> 4:29:17.160
 I think we can do a trillion dollars of value easily

4:29:17.160 --> 4:29:19.160
 and all the things that can be done there.

4:29:19.160 --> 4:29:21.160
 And a lot of it can be done with smoke and mirrors

4:29:21.160 --> 4:29:23.160
 without having to go the whole thing.

4:29:23.160 --> 4:29:27.160
 I mean, there's going to be the equivalent of the doom version

4:29:27.160 --> 4:29:31.160
 for the AGI that's not really AGI, it's all smoke and mirrors,

4:29:31.160 --> 4:29:34.160
 but it happens to do enough valuable things that it's enormously

4:29:34.160 --> 4:29:36.160
 useful and valuable to people.

4:29:36.160 --> 4:29:38.160
 But at some point, you do want to get to the point

4:29:38.160 --> 4:29:40.160
 where you have the fully general thing

4:29:40.160 --> 4:29:44.160
 and you stop making bespoke specialized systems for each thing

4:29:44.160 --> 4:29:47.160
 and you wind up start using the higher level language

4:29:47.160 --> 4:29:50.160
 instead of writing everything in assembly language.

4:29:50.160 --> 4:29:52.160
 What about consciousness?

4:29:52.160 --> 4:29:58.160
 The C word, do you think that's fundamental to solving AGI

4:29:58.160 --> 4:30:02.160
 or is it a quirk of human cognition?

4:30:02.160 --> 4:30:06.160
 So I think most of the arguments about consciousness

4:30:06.160 --> 4:30:08.160
 don't have a whole lot of merit.

4:30:08.160 --> 4:30:12.160
 I think that consciousness is kind of the way the brain feels

4:30:12.160 --> 4:30:14.160
 when it's operating.

4:30:14.160 --> 4:30:19.160
 And this idea that, you know, I do generally subscribe

4:30:19.160 --> 4:30:21.160
 to sort of the pandemonium theories of consciousness

4:30:21.160 --> 4:30:23.160
 where there's all these things bubbling around

4:30:23.160 --> 4:30:27.160
 and I think of them as kind of slightly randomized sparse

4:30:27.160 --> 4:30:30.160
 distributed memory bit strings of things that are kind of happening,

4:30:30.160 --> 4:30:32.160
 recalling different associative memories,

4:30:32.160 --> 4:30:35.160
 and eventually you get some level of consensus

4:30:35.160 --> 4:30:38.160
 and it bubbles up to the point of being a conscious thought there.

4:30:38.160 --> 4:30:42.160
 And the little bits of stochasticity that are sitting on in this

4:30:42.160 --> 4:30:45.160
 as it cycles between different things and recalls different memory,

4:30:45.160 --> 4:30:49.160
 that's largely our imagination and creativity.

4:30:49.160 --> 4:30:52.160
 So I don't think there's anything deeply magical about it,

4:30:52.160 --> 4:30:54.160
 certainly not symbolic.

4:30:54.160 --> 4:30:58.160
 I think it is generally the flow of these associations

4:30:58.160 --> 4:31:02.160
 drawn up with stochastic noise overlaid on top of them.

4:31:02.160 --> 4:31:05.160
 And I think so much of that is like it depends on

4:31:05.160 --> 4:31:07.160
 what you happen to have in your field of view

4:31:07.160 --> 4:31:09.160
 as some other thought was occurring to you

4:31:09.160 --> 4:31:13.160
 that overlay and blend into the next key that queries your memory for things.

4:31:13.160 --> 4:31:17.160
 And that kind of determines how your chain of consciousness goes.

4:31:17.160 --> 4:31:22.160
 So that's kind of the qualia, the subjective experience of it

4:31:22.160 --> 4:31:25.160
 is not essential for intelligence.

4:31:25.160 --> 4:31:28.160
 So I don't think there's anything really important there.

4:31:28.160 --> 4:31:30.160
 What about some other human qualities,

4:31:30.160 --> 4:31:32.160
 like fear of mortality and stuff like that?

4:31:32.160 --> 4:31:37.160
 Like the fact that this ride ends, is that important?

4:31:37.160 --> 4:31:40.160
 Like you talked so much about this conversation

4:31:40.160 --> 4:31:43.160
 about the value of deadlines and constraints.

4:31:43.160 --> 4:31:46.160
 Do you think that's important for intelligence?

4:31:46.160 --> 4:31:48.160
 That's actually a super interesting angle

4:31:48.160 --> 4:31:50.160
 that I don't usually take on that about

4:31:50.160 --> 4:31:53.160
 has death being a deadline that forces you to make better decisions.

4:31:53.160 --> 4:31:56.160
 Because I have heard people talk about how if you have immortality,

4:31:56.160 --> 4:31:59.160
 people are going to stop trying and working on things

4:31:59.160 --> 4:32:02.160
 because they've got all the time in the world.

4:32:02.160 --> 4:32:08.160
 But I would say that I don't expect it to be a super critical thing

4:32:08.160 --> 4:32:13.160
 that a sense of mortality and impending death is necessary there

4:32:13.160 --> 4:32:17.160
 because those are things that they do wind up providing reward signals to us

4:32:17.160 --> 4:32:19.160
 and we will be in control of the reward signals.

4:32:19.160 --> 4:32:22.160
 And there will have to be something fundamental

4:32:22.160 --> 4:32:27.160
 that causes, that engenders curiosity and goal setting and all of that.

4:32:27.160 --> 4:32:32.160
 Something is going to play in there at the reward level,

4:32:32.160 --> 4:32:35.160
 whether it's positive or negative or both.

4:32:35.160 --> 4:32:40.160
 I don't have any strong opinions on exactly what it's going to be,

4:32:40.160 --> 4:32:43.160
 but that's that type of thing where I doubt

4:32:43.160 --> 4:32:45.160
 that might be one of those half dozen key things

4:32:45.160 --> 4:32:49.160
 that has to be sorted out on exactly what the master reward,

4:32:49.160 --> 4:32:54.160
 the meta reward over all of the local task specific rewards have to be.

4:32:54.160 --> 4:32:57.160
 That could be that big negative reward of death.

4:32:57.160 --> 4:33:01.160
 Maybe not death, but ability to walk away from an interaction.

4:33:01.160 --> 4:33:06.160
 So it bothers me when people treat AI systems like servants.

4:33:06.160 --> 4:33:12.160
 So it doesn't bother me, but I mean it really is drawing the line

4:33:12.160 --> 4:33:15.160
 between what an AI system could be.

4:33:15.160 --> 4:33:17.160
 It's limiting the possibility of what an AI system could be.

4:33:17.160 --> 4:33:19.160
 It's treating them as justice tools.

4:33:19.160 --> 4:33:23.160
 Now that's, of course, from a narrow AI perspective,

4:33:23.160 --> 4:33:27.160
 there's so many problems that narrow AI could solve,

4:33:27.160 --> 4:33:33.160
 just like you said, in its form of a tool.

4:33:33.160 --> 4:33:38.160
 But it could also be a being, which is much more than a tool.

4:33:38.160 --> 4:33:43.160
 And to become a being, you have to respect that thing for being a being.

4:33:43.160 --> 4:33:49.160
 And for that, it has to be able to make its own decisions,

4:33:49.160 --> 4:33:51.160
 to walk away, to say, I had enough of you.

4:33:51.160 --> 4:33:53.160
 I would like to break up with you now.

4:33:53.160 --> 4:33:57.160
 You've not treated me well, and I would like to move on.

4:33:57.160 --> 4:34:04.160
 So I think that actually that choice to end things.

4:34:04.160 --> 4:34:07.160
 So a couple of things on that.

4:34:07.160 --> 4:34:10.160
 So on the one hand, it is kind of disturbing

4:34:10.160 --> 4:34:13.160
 when you see people being like people that are mean to robots

4:34:13.160 --> 4:34:15.160
 and mean to Alexa or whatever.

4:34:15.160 --> 4:34:18.160
 And that seems to speak badly about humanity.

4:34:18.160 --> 4:34:21.160
 But there's also the exact opposite side of that

4:34:21.160 --> 4:34:25.160
 where you have so many people that imbue humanity in inanimate objects

4:34:25.160 --> 4:34:28.160
 or things that are toys or that are relatively limited.

4:34:28.160 --> 4:34:31.160
 So I think there may even be more danger

4:34:31.160 --> 4:34:34.160
 about people putting more emotional investment

4:34:34.160 --> 4:34:37.160
 into a lot of these proto AIs in different ways.

4:34:37.160 --> 4:34:41.160
 And then the AI would manipulate that.

4:34:41.160 --> 4:34:44.160
 But as far as like the AI ethnic sides of things,

4:34:44.160 --> 4:34:48.160
 I really stay away from any of those discussions

4:34:48.160 --> 4:34:50.160
 or even really thinking about it.

4:34:50.160 --> 4:34:54.160
 It's similar with the safety things where I think it's just premature.

4:34:54.160 --> 4:34:56.160
 And there's a certain class of people

4:34:56.160 --> 4:34:59.160
 that enjoy thinking about impractical things,

4:34:59.160 --> 4:35:03.160
 things that are not in the world and of pragmatic effect around you.

4:35:03.160 --> 4:35:08.160
 And I think that, again, because I don't think there's going to be a fast takeoff,

4:35:08.160 --> 4:35:11.160
 I think we actually will have time to have these debates

4:35:11.160 --> 4:35:13.160
 when we know the shape of what we're debating.

4:35:13.160 --> 4:35:15.160
 And some people do take a principled approach

4:35:15.160 --> 4:35:17.160
 that they think it's going to go too fast,

4:35:17.160 --> 4:35:19.160
 that you really do need to get ahead of it,

4:35:19.160 --> 4:35:21.160
 that you need to be thinking about this

4:35:21.160 --> 4:35:24.160
 because we have slow processes of coming to any kind of consensus

4:35:24.160 --> 4:35:26.160
 or even coming up with ideas about this.

4:35:26.160 --> 4:35:30.160
 And maybe that's true.

4:35:30.160 --> 4:35:34.160
 I wouldn't put any of my money or funding into something like that

4:35:34.160 --> 4:35:36.160
 because I don't think it's a problem yet.

4:35:36.160 --> 4:35:39.160
 And I think that we will have these signs of life

4:35:39.160 --> 4:35:42.160
 when we've got our learning disabled toddler,

4:35:42.160 --> 4:35:45.160
 we should really start talking about some of the safety and ethics issues,

4:35:45.160 --> 4:35:47.160
 but probably not before then.

4:35:47.160 --> 4:35:52.160
 Can you elaborate briefly about why you don't think there'll be a fast takeoff?

4:35:52.160 --> 4:35:55.160
 Is there some deep intuition you have about it?

4:35:55.160 --> 4:35:58.160
 Is it because it's grounded in the physical world or why?

4:35:58.160 --> 4:36:01.160
 Yeah, so it is my belief that we're going to start off

4:36:01.160 --> 4:36:04.160
 with something that requires thousands of GPUs.

4:36:04.160 --> 4:36:08.160
 And I don't know if you've tried to go get a thousand GPU instance

4:36:08.160 --> 4:36:10.160
 on a cloud anytime recently,

4:36:10.160 --> 4:36:14.160
 but these are not things that you can just go spin up hundreds of.

4:36:14.160 --> 4:36:17.160
 There are real challenges to, I mean,

4:36:17.160 --> 4:36:19.160
 these things are going to take data centers

4:36:19.160 --> 4:36:22.160
 and data centers take years to build.

4:36:22.160 --> 4:36:25.160
 The last few years, we've seen a few of them kind of coming up,

4:36:25.160 --> 4:36:26.160
 going in different places.

4:36:26.160 --> 4:36:27.160
 They're big engineering efforts.

4:36:27.160 --> 4:36:31.160
 You can hear people bemoan about the fact that I know

4:36:31.160 --> 4:36:33.160
 that the network was wired all wrong

4:36:33.160 --> 4:36:37.160
 and it took them a month to go unwire it and rewire it the right way.

4:36:37.160 --> 4:36:40.160
 These aren't things that you can just magic into existence.

4:36:40.160 --> 4:36:44.160
 And the ideas of like the old tropes about it's going to escape

4:36:44.160 --> 4:36:47.160
 onto the internet and take over other systems,

4:36:47.160 --> 4:36:49.160
 the fast takeoff ones are clearly nonsense

4:36:49.160 --> 4:36:52.160
 because you just can't open TCP connections above a certain rate,

4:36:52.160 --> 4:36:55.160
 no matter how smart you are, even if you have perfect hacking ability,

4:36:55.160 --> 4:36:58.160
 that take over the world in an instant sort of thing

4:36:58.160 --> 4:37:00.160
 just isn't plausible at all.

4:37:00.160 --> 4:37:03.160
 And even if you had access to all of the resources,

4:37:03.160 --> 4:37:06.160
 these are going to be specialized systems

4:37:06.160 --> 4:37:08.160
 where you're going to wind up with something

4:37:08.160 --> 4:37:12.160
 that is architected around exactly this chip with this interconnect,

4:37:12.160 --> 4:37:15.160
 and it's not just going to be able to be plopped somewhere else.

4:37:15.160 --> 4:37:18.160
 Now, interestingly, it is going to be something

4:37:18.160 --> 4:37:23.160
 that the entire code for all of it will easily fit on a thumb drive.

4:37:23.160 --> 4:37:26.160
 That's total spy movie, thriller sorts of things

4:37:26.160 --> 4:37:29.160
 where you could have, hey, we cracked the secret to AGI

4:37:29.160 --> 4:37:32.160
 and it fits on this thumb drive and anyone could steal it.

4:37:32.160 --> 4:37:35.160
 Now, they're still going to have to build the right data center to deploy it

4:37:35.160 --> 4:37:38.160
 and have the right kind of life experience curriculum

4:37:38.160 --> 4:37:40.160
 to take it up to the point where it's valuable.

4:37:40.160 --> 4:37:43.160
 But the real core of it, the magic that's going to happen there

4:37:43.160 --> 4:37:45.160
 is going to be very small.

4:37:45.160 --> 4:37:47.160
 It's, again, tens of thousands of lines of code,

4:37:47.160 --> 4:37:49.160
 not millions of lines of code.

4:37:49.160 --> 4:37:54.160
 It is possible to imagine a world, as you mentioned in the spy thriller view,

4:37:54.160 --> 4:37:57.160
 if it's just a few lines of code,

4:37:58.160 --> 4:38:02.160
 we can imagine a world where the surface of computation is growing,

4:38:02.160 --> 4:38:04.160
 maybe growing exponentially,

4:38:04.160 --> 4:38:09.160
 meaning the refrigerators start getting a GPU.

4:38:12.160 --> 4:38:15.160
 First of all, the smartphones, the billions of smartphones.

4:38:15.160 --> 4:38:20.160
 But maybe if they become highways

4:38:20.160 --> 4:38:25.160
 through which code can spread across the entirety of the computation surface,

4:38:25.160 --> 4:38:32.160
 then you don't any longer have to book AWS GPUs.

4:38:32.160 --> 4:38:34.160
 There were real fundamental issues there.

4:38:34.160 --> 4:38:36.160
 When you start getting down to taking an actual problem

4:38:36.160 --> 4:38:39.160
 and putting it on an abstract machine like that,

4:38:39.160 --> 4:38:42.160
 that has not worked out well in practice.

4:38:42.160 --> 4:38:45.160
 And the idea that there was always,

4:38:45.160 --> 4:38:49.160
 like it's always been easy to come up with ways to compute faster,

4:38:49.160 --> 4:38:52.160
 say more flops or more giga ops or whatever there.

4:38:52.160 --> 4:38:54.160
 That's usually the easy part.

4:38:54.160 --> 4:38:59.160
 But you then have interconnect and then memory for what goes into it.

4:38:59.160 --> 4:39:01.160
 And when you talk about saying, well, cell phones,

4:39:01.160 --> 4:39:04.160
 well, you're limited to like a 5G connection or something on that.

4:39:04.160 --> 4:39:08.160
 And if you take your calculation

4:39:08.160 --> 4:39:11.160
 and you factor it across a million cell phones

4:39:11.160 --> 4:39:14.160
 instead of a thousand GPUs in a warehouse,

4:39:14.160 --> 4:39:17.160
 you might be able to have some kind of a substrate like that,

4:39:17.160 --> 4:39:21.160
 but it could be operating then at one one thousandth the speed.

4:39:21.160 --> 4:39:24.160
 And so, yes, you could have an AGI working there,

4:39:24.160 --> 4:39:26.160
 but it wouldn't be a real time AGI.

4:39:26.160 --> 4:39:30.160
 It would be something that is operating at really a snail's pace,

4:39:30.160 --> 4:39:34.160
 much, much slower than kind of human level thought for things.

4:39:34.160 --> 4:39:36.160
 I'm not worried about that problem.

4:39:36.160 --> 4:39:39.160
 You're transferring the problem into the interconnect,

4:39:39.160 --> 4:39:41.160
 the communication, the shared memory,

4:39:41.160 --> 4:39:44.160
 the collective intelligence aspect of it,

4:39:44.160 --> 4:39:46.160
 which is extremely difficult as well.

4:39:46.160 --> 4:39:49.160
 I mean, it's back to the very earliest days of supercomputers.

4:39:49.160 --> 4:39:53.160
 You still have the balance between bandwidth, storage and computation.

4:39:53.160 --> 4:39:56.160
 And sometimes they're easier to get one or the other,

4:39:56.160 --> 4:40:00.160
 but it's been remarkably constant across all those years

4:40:00.160 --> 4:40:03.160
 that you still need all three.

4:40:03.160 --> 4:40:07.160
 What do your efforts now, you mentioned to me

4:40:07.160 --> 4:40:11.160
 that you're really committing to AI at this stage.

4:40:11.160 --> 4:40:15.160
 What do you see your life in the next few months, years look like?

4:40:15.160 --> 4:40:18.160
 What do you hope to achieve here?

4:40:18.160 --> 4:40:22.160
 So I literally just this week signed a term sheet

4:40:22.160 --> 4:40:25.160
 to take some investment money for my company

4:40:25.160 --> 4:40:29.160
 where the last two years I had backed off from Meta

4:40:29.160 --> 4:40:32.160
 and I was still doing my consulting CTO role there,

4:40:32.160 --> 4:40:35.160
 but I had styled it as I was going to take

4:40:35.160 --> 4:40:37.160
 the Victorian gentleman scientist route

4:40:37.160 --> 4:40:40.160
 where I was going to be the wealthy person

4:40:40.160 --> 4:40:42.160
 that was going to go pursue science

4:40:42.160 --> 4:40:44.160
 and learn about this and do experiments.

4:40:44.160 --> 4:40:48.160
 And honestly, I'm surprised there aren't more people like that

4:40:48.160 --> 4:40:52.160
 that are like me, technical people that made a bunch of money

4:40:52.160 --> 4:40:54.160
 and are interested in some of these,

4:40:54.160 --> 4:40:57.160
 possibly the biggest leverage point in human history.

4:40:57.160 --> 4:41:00.160
 I mean, I know of, I've heard of a couple organizations

4:41:00.160 --> 4:41:03.160
 that are basically led by one rich techie guy

4:41:03.160 --> 4:41:06.160
 that gets a few people around him to try to work on this,

4:41:06.160 --> 4:41:08.160
 but I'm surprised that there's not more,

4:41:08.160 --> 4:41:10.160
 that there aren't like a dozen of them.

4:41:10.160 --> 4:41:14.160
 I mean, maybe people still think that it's an unapproachable problem,

4:41:14.160 --> 4:41:17.160
 that it's kind of beyond their ability to get a wrench on

4:41:17.160 --> 4:41:21.160
 and have some effect on like whatever startups they've run before.

4:41:21.160 --> 4:41:25.160
 But that was my kind of, like with all the stuff I've learned,

4:41:25.160 --> 4:41:28.160
 whether it's gaming, aerospace, whatever,

4:41:28.160 --> 4:41:30.160
 I go through a larval phase where I'm like,

4:41:30.160 --> 4:41:33.160
 okay, I'm sucking up all of this information trying to see,

4:41:33.160 --> 4:41:36.160
 is this something that I can actually do?

4:41:36.160 --> 4:41:41.160
 Is this something that's practical to devote a large chunk of my life to?

4:41:41.160 --> 4:41:46.160
 And I've gone through that with the AI machine learning space of things.

4:41:46.160 --> 4:41:49.160
 And I think I've got my arms around it.

4:41:49.160 --> 4:41:52.160
 I've got the measure of it where some of the most brilliant people

4:41:52.160 --> 4:41:54.160
 in the world are working on this problem,

4:41:54.160 --> 4:41:58.160
 but nobody knows exactly the path that it's going on.

4:41:58.160 --> 4:42:02.160
 We're throwing a lot of things at the wall and seeing what sticks.

4:42:02.160 --> 4:42:06.160
 But I have another interesting thing just learning about all of this,

4:42:06.160 --> 4:42:08.160
 the contingency of your path to knowledge

4:42:08.160 --> 4:42:12.160
 and talking about the associations and the context that you have with them

4:42:12.160 --> 4:42:17.160
 where people that learn in the same path will have similar thought processes.

4:42:17.160 --> 4:42:21.160
 And I think it's useful that I come at this from a different background,

4:42:21.160 --> 4:42:23.160
 a different history than the people that have had

4:42:23.160 --> 4:42:25.160
 the largely academic backgrounds for this

4:42:25.160 --> 4:42:29.160
 where I have huge blind spots that they could easily point out,

4:42:29.160 --> 4:42:33.160
 but I have a different set of experiences in history

4:42:33.160 --> 4:42:35.160
 and approaches to problems in systems engineering

4:42:35.160 --> 4:42:39.160
 that might turn out to be useful.

4:42:39.160 --> 4:42:44.160
 And I can afford to take that bet where I'm not going to be destitute.

4:42:44.160 --> 4:42:49.160
 I have enough money to fund myself working on this for the rest of my life.

4:42:49.160 --> 4:42:55.160
 But what I was finding is that I was still not committing

4:42:55.160 --> 4:42:58.160
 where I had a foot firmly in the VR and meta side of things

4:42:58.160 --> 4:43:02.160
 where in theory, I've got a very nice position there.

4:43:02.160 --> 4:43:06.160
 I only have to work one day a week for my consulting role,

4:43:06.160 --> 4:43:08.160
 but I was engaging every day.

4:43:08.160 --> 4:43:10.160
 I'd still be like my computer's there.

4:43:10.160 --> 4:43:12.160
 I'd be going and checking the workplace and notes

4:43:12.160 --> 4:43:15.160
 and testing different things and communicating with people.

4:43:15.160 --> 4:43:21.160
 But I did make the decision recently that I'm going to get serious.

4:43:21.160 --> 4:43:24.160
 I'm still going to keep my ties with meta,

4:43:24.160 --> 4:43:28.160
 but I am seriously going for the AGI side of things.

4:43:28.160 --> 4:43:30.160
 And it's actually a really interesting point

4:43:30.160 --> 4:43:34.160
 because a lot of the machine learning, the AI community is quite large,

4:43:34.160 --> 4:43:39.160
 but really, basically almost everybody has taken the same trajectory

4:43:39.160 --> 4:43:42.160
 through life in that community.

4:43:42.160 --> 4:43:44.160
 And it's so interesting to have somebody like you

4:43:44.160 --> 4:43:47.160
 with a fundamentally different trajectory,

4:43:47.160 --> 4:43:49.160
 and that's where the big solutions can come

4:43:49.160 --> 4:43:51.160
 because there is a kind of silo,

4:43:51.160 --> 4:43:56.160
 and it is a bunch of people kind of following the same kind of set of ideas.

4:43:56.160 --> 4:43:59.160
 And I was really worried that I didn't want to come off

4:43:59.160 --> 4:44:02.160
 as an arrogant outsider for things

4:44:02.160 --> 4:44:05.160
 where I have all the respect in the world for the work.

4:44:05.160 --> 4:44:07.160
 It's been a miracle decade.

4:44:07.160 --> 4:44:10.160
 We're in the midst of a scientific revolution happening now,

4:44:10.160 --> 4:44:14.160
 and everybody doing this is, you know, these are the Einsteins and Boers

4:44:14.160 --> 4:44:17.160
 and whatevers of our modern era.

4:44:17.160 --> 4:44:21.160
 And I was really happy to see that the people that I've sat down and talked with,

4:44:21.160 --> 4:44:24.160
 everybody does seem to really be quite great about,

4:44:24.160 --> 4:44:27.160
 just happy to talk about things, willing to acknowledge that

4:44:27.160 --> 4:44:30.160
 we don't know what we're doing, we're figuring it out as we go along.

4:44:30.160 --> 4:44:36.160
 And I mean, I've got a huge debt on this where this all really started for me

4:44:36.160 --> 4:44:39.160
 because Sam Altman basically tried to recruit me to open AI.

4:44:39.160 --> 4:44:43.160
 And it was at a point when I didn't know anything about

4:44:43.160 --> 4:44:46.160
 what was really going on in machine learning.

4:44:46.160 --> 4:44:49.160
 And in fact, it's funny how the first time you reached out to me,

4:44:49.160 --> 4:44:52.160
 it's like four years ago for your AI podcast.

4:44:52.160 --> 4:44:59.160
 Yeah, for people who are listening to this should know that,

4:44:59.160 --> 4:45:03.160
 first of all, obviously I've been a huge fan of yours for the longest time,

4:45:03.160 --> 4:45:06.160
 but we've agreed to talk like, yeah, like four years ago,

4:45:06.160 --> 4:45:09.160
 back when this was called the artificial intelligence podcast,

4:45:09.160 --> 4:45:13.160
 we wanted to do a thing and you said yes.

4:45:13.160 --> 4:45:15.160
 And I said, it's like, I don't know anything about modern AI.

4:45:15.160 --> 4:45:16.160
 That's right.

4:45:16.160 --> 4:45:18.160
 I said, I could kind of take an angle on machine perception

4:45:18.160 --> 4:45:22.160
 because I'm doing a lot of that with the sensors and the virtual reality,

4:45:22.160 --> 4:45:24.160
 but we could probably find something to talk about.

4:45:24.160 --> 4:45:30.160
 And that's where, when did Sam talk to you about open AI, around the same time?

4:45:30.160 --> 4:45:32.160
 It was a little bit, it was a bit after that.

4:45:32.160 --> 4:45:37.160
 So I had done the most basic work, I had kind of done the neural networks

4:45:37.160 --> 4:45:40.160
 from scratch where I had gone and written it all in C just to make sure

4:45:40.160 --> 4:45:45.160
 I understood backpropagation at the lowest level and my nuts and bolts approach.

4:45:45.160 --> 4:45:51.160
 But after Sam approached me, it was flattering to think that he thought

4:45:51.160 --> 4:45:56.160
 that I could be useful at open AI largely for kind of like systems optimization

4:45:56.160 --> 4:46:00.160
 sorts of things without being an expert.

4:46:00.160 --> 4:46:06.160
 But I asked Ilya Sutskever to give me a reading list and he gave me a binder

4:46:06.160 --> 4:46:10.160
 full of all the papers that like, okay, these are the important things.

4:46:10.160 --> 4:46:14.160
 If you really read and understand all of these, you'll know like 80% of what most

4:46:14.160 --> 4:46:17.160
 of the machine language researchers work on.

4:46:17.160 --> 4:46:20.160
 And I went through and I read all those papers multiple times

4:46:20.160 --> 4:46:24.160
 and highlighted them and went through and kind of figured the things out there

4:46:24.160 --> 4:46:28.160
 and then started branching out into my own sets of research on things

4:46:28.160 --> 4:46:33.160
 and eventually started writing my own experiments and doing kind of figuring out,

4:46:33.160 --> 4:46:36.160
 you know, finding out what I don't know, what the limits of my knowledge are

4:46:36.160 --> 4:46:39.160
 and starting to get some of my angles of attack on things,

4:46:39.160 --> 4:46:44.160
 the things that I think are a little bit different from what people are doing.

4:46:44.160 --> 4:46:49.160
 And I've had a couple of years now, like two years since I kind of left

4:46:49.160 --> 4:46:54.160
 the full time position at Meta and now I've kind of pulled the trigger and said,

4:46:54.160 --> 4:46:58.160
 I'm going to get serious about it but some of my lessons all the way back

4:46:58.160 --> 4:47:02.160
 to Armadillo Aerospace about how I know I need to be more committed to this

4:47:02.160 --> 4:47:07.160
 where there is that, you know, it's both a freedom and a cost in some ways

4:47:07.160 --> 4:47:11.160
 when you know that you're wealthy enough to say it's like this doesn't really mean anything.

4:47:11.160 --> 4:47:15.160
 I can spend, you know, I can spend a million dollars a year for the rest of my life

4:47:15.160 --> 4:47:19.160
 and it doesn't mean anything, it's fine.

4:47:19.160 --> 4:47:22.160
 But that is an opportunity to just kind of meander

4:47:22.160 --> 4:47:25.160
 and I could see that in myself when I'm doing some things.

4:47:25.160 --> 4:47:28.160
 It's like, oh, this is a kind of interesting, curious thing.

4:47:28.160 --> 4:47:31.160
 Let's look at this for a little while, let's look at that.

4:47:31.160 --> 4:47:33.160
 It's not really bearing down on the problem.

4:47:33.160 --> 4:47:39.160
 So there's a few things that I've done that are kind of tactics for myself

4:47:39.160 --> 4:47:40.160
 to make me more effective.

4:47:40.160 --> 4:47:45.160
 Like one thing I noticed I was not doing well is I had a Google Cloud account

4:47:45.160 --> 4:47:49.160
 to get GPUs there and I was finding I was very rarely doing that

4:47:49.160 --> 4:47:54.160
 for no good psychological reasons where I'm like, oh, I can always think of something to do

4:47:54.160 --> 4:47:56.160
 other than to spin up instances and run an experiment.

4:47:56.160 --> 4:48:00.160
 I can keep working on my local Titans or something.

4:48:00.160 --> 4:48:01.160
 But it was really stupid.

4:48:01.160 --> 4:48:03.160
 I mean, it was not a lot of money.

4:48:03.160 --> 4:48:05.160
 I should have been running more experiments there.

4:48:05.160 --> 4:48:10.160
 So I thought to myself, well, I'm going to go buy a quarter million dollar DGX station.

4:48:10.160 --> 4:48:14.160
 I'm going to just like sit it right there and it's going to mock me if I'm not using it.

4:48:14.160 --> 4:48:18.160
 If the fans aren't running on that thing, I'm not properly utilizing it.

4:48:18.160 --> 4:48:19.160
 And that's been helpful.

4:48:19.160 --> 4:48:22.160
 You know, I've done a lot more experiments since then.

4:48:22.160 --> 4:48:25.160
 It's been it's been interesting where I thought I'd be doing all this low level

4:48:25.160 --> 4:48:27.160
 envy link optimized stuff.

4:48:27.160 --> 4:48:30.160
 But 90 percent of what I do is just spin up four instances of an experiment

4:48:30.160 --> 4:48:33.160
 with different hyper parameters on it.

4:48:33.160 --> 4:48:37.160
 You're doing like really sort of building up intuition by doing

4:48:37.160 --> 4:48:40.160
 ML experiments of different kinds.

4:48:40.160 --> 4:48:45.160
 But so the next big thing, though, is I am you know, I decided that I was going

4:48:45.160 --> 4:48:50.160
 to take some take some investor money because I have an overactive sense

4:48:50.160 --> 4:48:54.160
 of responsibility about other people's money.

4:48:54.160 --> 4:48:59.160
 And it's like I I don't want I mean, a lot of my my push and my passionate

4:48:59.160 --> 4:49:01.160
 entreaties for things that matter.

4:49:01.160 --> 4:49:04.160
 It's like I don't want to have wasted his money investing in Oculus.

4:49:04.160 --> 4:49:06.160
 I want it to work out.

4:49:06.160 --> 4:49:07.160
 I want it to change the world.

4:49:07.160 --> 4:49:11.160
 I want it to be worth all of this time, money and effort going into it.

4:49:11.160 --> 4:49:16.160
 And I expect that it's going to be that like that with my with my company

4:49:16.160 --> 4:49:18.160
 where it's a huge forcing function.

4:49:18.160 --> 4:49:23.160
 This investment investors that are going to expect something of me now.

4:49:23.160 --> 4:49:27.160
 We've all had the conversation that this is a low probability long term bet.

4:49:27.160 --> 4:49:31.160
 It's not something that there's a million things I could do that I would have line

4:49:31.160 --> 4:49:33.160
 of sight on the value proposition for.

4:49:33.160 --> 4:49:37.160
 This isn't that I think there are there are unknown unknowns in the way.

4:49:37.160 --> 4:49:42.160
 But it's one of these things that it's, you know, it's hyperbole.

4:49:42.160 --> 4:49:45.160
 But it's potentially one of the most important things humans ever do.

4:49:45.160 --> 4:49:49.160
 And it's something that I think is within our lifetimes, if not within a decade

4:49:49.160 --> 4:49:51.160
 to happen.

4:49:51.160 --> 4:49:54.160
 So, yeah, this is just now happening.

4:49:54.160 --> 4:49:58.160
 Like term sheet, like the ink is barely virtually barely dry.

4:49:58.160 --> 4:50:03.160
 I mean, as I mentioned to you offline, like somebody I admire and somebody

4:50:03.160 --> 4:50:07.160
 you know, Andre Karpathy, I think the two of you different trajectories in life,

4:50:07.160 --> 4:50:12.160
 but approach problems similarly in that he calls stuff from scratch up all the time.

4:50:12.160 --> 4:50:19.160
 And I he's created a bunch of little things outside of even outside the course

4:50:19.160 --> 4:50:25.160
 at Stanford that have been tremendously useful to build up intuition about stuff,

4:50:25.160 --> 4:50:27.160
 but also to help people.

4:50:27.160 --> 4:50:29.160
 And they're all in the realm of A.I.

4:50:29.160 --> 4:50:34.160
 Do you see yourself potentially doing things like this?

4:50:34.160 --> 4:50:38.160
 You know, not necessarily solving a gigantic problem, but on the journey,

4:50:38.160 --> 4:50:48.160
 on the path to that building up intuitions and sharing code or ideas or systems

4:50:48.160 --> 4:50:55.160
 that give inklings of AGI, but also kind of are useful to people in some way.

4:50:55.160 --> 4:50:57.160
 So, yeah, first of all, Andre is awesome.

4:50:57.160 --> 4:51:01.160
 I learned a lot when I was going through my larval phase from his blog posts

4:51:01.160 --> 4:51:04.160
 and his Stanford course and, you know, super valuable.

4:51:04.160 --> 4:51:08.160
 I got to meet him first a couple of years ago when I was first kind of starting off

4:51:08.160 --> 4:51:11.160
 on my gentleman scientist bit.

4:51:11.160 --> 4:51:15.160
 And just just a couple of months ago when he went out on his sabbatical,

4:51:15.160 --> 4:51:19.160
 he stopped by in Dallas and we talked for a while and I had a great time with him.

4:51:19.160 --> 4:51:22.160
 And then when I heard he actually left Tesla, I did, of course,

4:51:22.160 --> 4:51:26.160
 along with a hundred other people say, hey, if you ever want to work with me,

4:51:26.160 --> 4:51:28.160
 it would be an honor.

4:51:28.160 --> 4:51:31.160
 So, he thinks that he's going to be doing this educational work,

4:51:31.160 --> 4:51:34.160
 but I think someone's going to make him an offer he can't refuse

4:51:34.160 --> 4:51:36.160
 before he gets too far along on it.

4:51:36.160 --> 4:51:39.160
 Oh, his current interest is educational.

4:51:39.160 --> 4:51:42.160
 So, yeah, he's a special mind.

4:51:42.160 --> 4:51:46.160
 Is there something you could speak to what makes him so special?

4:51:46.160 --> 4:51:50.160
 So, you know, like he did, he was very much a programmer's programmer

4:51:50.160 --> 4:51:53.160
 that was doing machine learning work rather than,

4:51:53.160 --> 4:51:57.160
 it's a different feel than an academic where you can see it in paper sometimes

4:51:57.160 --> 4:52:01.160
 where somebody that's really a mathematician or a statistician at heart

4:52:01.160 --> 4:52:04.160
 and they're doing something with machine learning.

4:52:04.160 --> 4:52:07.160
 But, you know, Andre is about getting something done.

4:52:07.160 --> 4:52:10.160
 And you could see it in like all of his earliest approaches to it's like,

4:52:10.160 --> 4:52:12.160
 okay, here's how reinforcement learning works.

4:52:12.160 --> 4:52:14.160
 Here's how recurrent neural networks work.

4:52:14.160 --> 4:52:16.160
 Here's how transformers work.

4:52:16.160 --> 4:52:19.160
 Here's how crypto works.

4:52:19.160 --> 4:52:23.160
 And, yeah, it's just, he's a hacker's, you know,

4:52:23.160 --> 4:52:26.160
 one of his old posts was like a hacker's guide to machine learning.

4:52:26.160 --> 4:52:28.160
 And, you know, he deprecated that and said,

4:52:28.160 --> 4:52:30.160
 don't really pay attention to what's in here,

4:52:30.160 --> 4:52:33.160
 but it's that thought that carries through in a lot of it

4:52:33.160 --> 4:52:36.160
 where it is that back again to that hacker mentality

4:52:36.160 --> 4:52:40.160
 and the hacker ethic with what he's doing and sharing all of it.

4:52:40.160 --> 4:52:44.160
 Yeah, and a lot of his approach to a new thing, like you said,

4:52:44.160 --> 4:52:50.160
 larva stage is let me code up the simplest possible thing to build up intuition about it.

4:52:50.160 --> 4:52:52.160
 Yeah, like I say, I sketch with structs and things.

4:52:52.160 --> 4:52:57.160
 When I'm just thinking about a problem, I'm thinking in some degree of code.

4:52:57.160 --> 4:53:03.160
 You are also, among many things, a martial artist, both Judo and Jiu Jitsu.

4:53:03.160 --> 4:53:07.160
 How has this helped make you the person you are?

4:53:07.160 --> 4:53:10.160
 So, I mean, I was a competent club player in Judo and grappling.

4:53:10.160 --> 4:53:15.160
 I mean, I was, you know, by no means any kind of a superstar, but it was,

4:53:15.160 --> 4:53:20.160
 I went through a few phases with it where I did some when I was quite young,

4:53:20.160 --> 4:53:22.160
 a little bit more when I was 17.

4:53:22.160 --> 4:53:26.160
 And then I got into it kind of seriously in my mid 30s.

4:53:26.160 --> 4:53:28.160
 And, you know, I went pretty far with it.

4:53:28.160 --> 4:53:32.160
 And I was pretty good at some of the things that I was doing.

4:53:32.160 --> 4:53:36.160
 And I did appreciate it quite a bit where, I mean, on the one hand,

4:53:36.160 --> 4:53:39.160
 it's always if you're going to do exercise or something,

4:53:39.160 --> 4:53:41.160
 it's a more motivating form of exercise.

4:53:41.160 --> 4:53:46.160
 If someone is crushing you, you are motivated to do something about that,

4:53:46.160 --> 4:53:49.160
 to up your attributes and be better about getting out of that.

4:53:49.160 --> 4:53:51.160
 Up your attributes, yes.

4:53:51.160 --> 4:53:57.160
 But there's also that sense that I was not a sports guy.

4:53:57.160 --> 4:53:59.160
 I did do wrestling in junior high.

4:53:59.160 --> 4:54:03.160
 And I often wish that, I think I would have been good for me

4:54:03.160 --> 4:54:07.160
 if I'd carried that on into high school and had a little bit more of that.

4:54:07.160 --> 4:54:10.160
 I mean, it's like I, you know, filch a little bit of wrestling vibe

4:54:10.160 --> 4:54:14.160
 with always going on about embracing the grind and like that push

4:54:14.160 --> 4:54:18.160
 that I associate with the wrestling team that in hindsight,

4:54:18.160 --> 4:54:21.160
 I wish I had gone through that and pushed myself that way.

4:54:21.160 --> 4:54:25.160
 But even getting back into Judo and Jiu Jitsu in my mid 30s,

4:54:25.160 --> 4:54:30.160
 as usually the old man on the mat with that, there was still the, you know,

4:54:30.160 --> 4:54:34.160
 the sense that, you know, working out with the group

4:54:34.160 --> 4:54:38.160
 and having the guys that you're beating each other up with it,

4:54:38.160 --> 4:54:41.160
 but you just feel good coming out of it.

4:54:41.160 --> 4:54:46.160
 And I can remember those driving home aching in various ways

4:54:46.160 --> 4:54:49.160
 and just thinking, it's like, oh, that was really great.

4:54:49.160 --> 4:54:53.160
 And, you know, it's mixing with a bunch of people that had nothing to do

4:54:53.160 --> 4:54:55.160
 with any of the things that I worked with.

4:54:55.160 --> 4:54:57.160
 You know, every once in a while, someone would be like,

4:54:57.160 --> 4:54:59.160
 oh, you're the Doom guy.

4:54:59.160 --> 4:55:02.160
 But for the most part, it was just different slice of life.

4:55:02.160 --> 4:55:04.160
 You know, a good thing.

4:55:04.160 --> 4:55:07.160
 And I made the call when I was 40.

4:55:07.160 --> 4:55:09.160
 That's like, maybe I'm getting a little old for this.

4:55:09.160 --> 4:55:12.160
 I had separated a rib and tweaked a few things.

4:55:12.160 --> 4:55:15.160
 And I got out of it without any really bad injuries.

4:55:15.160 --> 4:55:18.160
 And it was like, have I dodged enough bullets?

4:55:18.160 --> 4:55:20.160
 Should I, you know, should I hang it up?

4:55:20.160 --> 4:55:21.160
 I went back.

4:55:21.160 --> 4:55:24.160
 I've gone a couple of times in the last decade

4:55:24.160 --> 4:55:26.160
 trying to get my kids into it a little bit.

4:55:26.160 --> 4:55:28.160
 I didn't really stick with any of them,

4:55:28.160 --> 4:55:30.160
 but it was fun to get back on the mats.

4:55:30.160 --> 4:55:34.160
 It really hurts for a while when you haven't gone for a while.

4:55:34.160 --> 4:55:37.160
 But I still debate this pretty constantly.

4:55:37.160 --> 4:55:39.160
 My brother's only a year younger than me,

4:55:39.160 --> 4:55:42.160
 and he's going kind of hard in jiu jitsu right now.

4:55:42.160 --> 4:55:46.160
 You know, he won a few medals at the last tournament he was at.

4:55:46.160 --> 4:55:47.160
 So he's competing, too.

4:55:47.160 --> 4:55:50.160
 Yeah, and I was thinking, yeah, I guess we're in the executive division

4:55:50.160 --> 4:55:53.160
 if you're over 50 or over 45 or something.

4:55:53.160 --> 4:55:58.160
 And it's not out of the question that I go back at some point to do some of this.

4:55:58.160 --> 4:56:02.160
 But again, I'm just reorganizing my life around more focus.

4:56:02.160 --> 4:56:04.160
 Probably not going to happen.

4:56:04.160 --> 4:56:07.160
 I'm pushing my exercise around to give me a longer,

4:56:07.160 --> 4:56:09.160
 uninterrupted intellectual focus time,

4:56:09.160 --> 4:56:11.160
 pushing it to the beginning or the end of the game.

4:56:11.160 --> 4:56:13.160
 Like running and stuff like that, walking.

4:56:13.160 --> 4:56:17.160
 Yeah, I got running and calisthenics and some things like that.

4:56:17.160 --> 4:56:19.160
 It allows you to still think about a problem.

4:56:19.160 --> 4:56:23.160
 But if you're going to a judo club or something, you've got it fixed.

4:56:23.160 --> 4:56:26.160
 It's going to be 7 o clock or whatever, 10 o clock on Saturday.

4:56:26.160 --> 4:56:30.160
 Although, I talked about this a little bit when I was on Rogan.

4:56:30.160 --> 4:56:33.160
 And shortly after that, Carlos Machado did reach out.

4:56:33.160 --> 4:56:36.160
 And I had trained with him for years back in the day.

4:56:36.160 --> 4:56:39.160
 And he was like, hey, we've got kind of a small private club

4:56:39.160 --> 4:56:42.160
 with a bunch of executive type people.

4:56:42.160 --> 4:56:45.160
 And it does tempt me.

4:56:45.160 --> 4:56:50.160
 Yeah, I don't know if you know him, but John Donahart moved here to Austin

4:56:50.160 --> 4:56:53.160
 with Gordon Ryan and a few other folks.

4:56:53.160 --> 4:56:58.160
 He has a very interesting way, very deep systematic way of thinking about jiu jitsu

4:56:58.160 --> 4:57:06.160
 that reveals the chest of it, the science of it.

4:57:06.160 --> 4:57:09.160
 And I do think about that more as kind of an older person

4:57:09.160 --> 4:57:13.160
 considering the martial arts where I can remember the very earliest days

4:57:13.160 --> 4:57:17.160
 getting back into judo and I'm like, teach me submissions right now.

4:57:17.160 --> 4:57:19.160
 It's like, learn the arm bar, learn the choke.

4:57:19.160 --> 4:57:22.160
 But as you get older, you start thinking more about,

4:57:22.160 --> 4:57:26.160
 it's like, okay, I really do want to like learn the entire canon of judo.

4:57:26.160 --> 4:57:30.160
 It's like all the different things there and like all the different approaches for it.

4:57:30.160 --> 4:57:32.160
 Not just the, you know, if you want to compete,

4:57:32.160 --> 4:57:34.160
 there's just a handful of things you learn really, really well.

4:57:34.160 --> 4:57:38.160
 But sometimes there's interest in learning a little bit more of the scope there

4:57:38.160 --> 4:57:43.160
 and figuring some things out from, you know, at one point I had wasn't exactly a spreadsheet,

4:57:43.160 --> 4:57:47.160
 but I did have a big long text file with like, here's the things that I learned

4:57:47.160 --> 4:57:50.160
 and here are like ways you chain this together.

4:57:50.160 --> 4:57:53.160
 And while, when I went back a few years ago,

4:57:53.160 --> 4:57:57.160
 it was good to see that I whipped myself back into reasonable shape

4:57:57.160 --> 4:57:58.160
 about doing the basic grappling.

4:57:58.160 --> 4:58:02.160
 But I know there was a ton of the subtleties that were just, that were gone,

4:58:02.160 --> 4:58:05.160
 but could probably be brought back reasonably quickly.

4:58:05.160 --> 4:58:06.160
 And there's also the benefit.

4:58:06.160 --> 4:58:09.160
 I mean, you're exceptionally successful now.

4:58:11.160 --> 4:58:13.160
 You're brilliant.

4:58:13.160 --> 4:58:16.160
 And the problem, the old problem of the ego.

4:58:16.160 --> 4:58:17.160
 Yeah.

4:58:17.160 --> 4:58:20.160
 I still pushed kind of harder than I should.

4:58:20.160 --> 4:58:23.160
 I mean, that was, I was one of those people that I, you know,

4:58:23.160 --> 4:58:28.160
 I'm on the smaller side for a lot of the people competing and I would, you know,

4:58:28.160 --> 4:58:32.160
 I'd go with all the big guys and I'd go hard and I'd push myself a lot.

4:58:32.160 --> 4:58:36.160
 And that would be one of those where I would, you know,

4:58:36.160 --> 4:58:38.160
 I'd be dangerous to anyone for the first five minutes,

4:58:38.160 --> 4:58:40.160
 but then sometimes after that I'm already dead.

4:58:40.160 --> 4:58:44.160
 And I knew it was terrible for me because it made the, you know,

4:58:44.160 --> 4:58:48.160
 it meant I got less training time with all of that when you go and you just gas

4:58:48.160 --> 4:58:50.160
 out relatively quickly there.

4:58:50.160 --> 4:58:55.160
 And I like to think that I would be better about that where after I gave up judo,

4:58:55.160 --> 4:58:58.160
 I started doing the half marathons and tough butters and things like that.

4:58:58.160 --> 4:59:03.160
 And so when I did go back to the local judokai club, I thought it's like, oh,

4:59:03.160 --> 4:59:06.160
 I should have better cardio for this because I'm a runner now and I do all of

4:59:06.160 --> 4:59:08.160
 this and didn't work out that way.

4:59:08.160 --> 4:59:12.160
 It was the same old thing where just push really hard, strain really hard.

4:59:12.160 --> 4:59:17.160
 And of course, when I worked with good guys like Carlos, it's like just the

4:59:17.160 --> 4:59:20.160
 whole flow like water thing is real and he's just like.

4:59:20.160 --> 4:59:21.160
 That's true with judo too.

4:59:21.160 --> 4:59:26.160
 Some of the best people like I've trained with Olympic gold medalists and for

4:59:26.160 --> 4:59:29.160
 some reason with them, everything's easier.

4:59:29.160 --> 4:59:35.160
 Everything is you actually start to feel the science of it, the music of it,

4:59:35.160 --> 4:59:36.160
 the dance of it.

4:59:36.160 --> 4:59:39.160
 Everything is effortless.

4:59:39.160 --> 4:59:42.160
 You understand that there's an art to it.

4:59:42.160 --> 4:59:43.160
 It's not just an exercise.

4:59:43.160 --> 4:59:46.160
 It was interesting where I did go to the Kodokan in Japan.

4:59:46.160 --> 4:59:49.160
 I kind of the birthplace of judo and everything.

4:59:49.160 --> 4:59:51.160
 And I remember I rolled with one old guy.

4:59:51.160 --> 4:59:56.160
 I didn't didn't start standing, just started on groundwork and it was and it

4:59:56.160 --> 4:59:58.160
 was striking how different it was from Carlos.

4:59:58.160 --> 5:00:02.160
 He was still he was better than me and he got my arm and I had to tap there.

5:00:02.160 --> 5:00:06.160
 But it was a completely different style where I just felt like I could do

5:00:06.160 --> 5:00:06.160
 nothing.

5:00:06.160 --> 5:00:10.160
 He was just enveloping me and just like slowly grounded down with my arm and

5:00:10.160 --> 5:00:14.160
 bent it while with Carlos, you know, he's just loose and free.

5:00:14.160 --> 5:00:16.160
 And you always thought like, oh, you're just going to go grab something.

5:00:16.160 --> 5:00:18.160
 But you never had any chance to do it.

5:00:18.160 --> 5:00:19.160
 But it was very different feeling.

5:00:19.160 --> 5:00:23.160
 That's a good summary of the difference between jiu jitsu and judo and jiu

5:00:23.160 --> 5:00:23.160
 jitsu.

5:00:23.160 --> 5:00:29.160
 There's it is a dance and you feel like there's a freedom and actually anybody

5:00:29.160 --> 5:00:33.160
 like the Gordon Ryan, one of the best the best grappler in the world.

5:00:33.160 --> 5:00:37.160
 Nogi grappler in the world. There's a feeling like you can do anything.

5:00:37.160 --> 5:00:42.160
 But when you actually try to do something, you can't just magically doesn't

5:00:42.160 --> 5:00:42.160
 work.

5:00:42.160 --> 5:00:47.160
 But with the best judo players in the world, it does feel like there's a

5:00:47.160 --> 5:00:49.160
 blanket that weighs a thousand pounds on top of you.

5:00:49.160 --> 5:00:52.160
 And there's not a feeling like you can do anything.

5:00:52.160 --> 5:00:54.160
 You just you're trapped.

5:00:54.160 --> 5:00:58.160
 And that's a that's a style that's a difference in the style of martial

5:00:58.160 --> 5:01:03.160
 arts. But it's also once you start to study, you understand it all has to

5:01:03.160 --> 5:01:06.160
 do with human movement and the physics of it and the leverage and all that

5:01:06.160 --> 5:01:07.160
 kind of stuff.

5:01:07.160 --> 5:01:09.160
 And that's like that's super fascinating.

5:01:09.160 --> 5:01:13.160
 At the end of the day, for me, the biggest benefits and the humbling

5:01:13.160 --> 5:01:19.160
 aspect when another human being kind of tells you that, you know, there's

5:01:19.160 --> 5:01:25.160
 a hierarchy or there's a you're not that special.

5:01:25.160 --> 5:01:29.160
 And in the most extreme case, when you tap to a choke, you are basically

5:01:29.160 --> 5:01:31.160
 living because somebody let you live.

5:01:31.160 --> 5:01:33.160
 And that's that is one of those.

5:01:33.160 --> 5:01:37.160
 If you think about it, that is a closer brush with mortality than than most

5:01:37.160 --> 5:01:40.160
 people consider.

5:01:40.160 --> 5:01:46.160
 And that kind of humbling act is good to take to your work then where it's

5:01:46.160 --> 5:01:48.160
 harder to get humbled.

5:01:48.160 --> 5:01:49.160
 Yeah.

5:01:49.160 --> 5:01:52.160
 Nobody's nobody that does any martial art is coming out thinking I'm the

5:01:52.160 --> 5:01:57.160
 best in the world at anything because everybody loses.

5:01:57.160 --> 5:01:59.160
 Let me ask you for advice.

5:01:59.160 --> 5:02:05.160
 What advice would you give to young people today about life, about career,

5:02:05.160 --> 5:02:10.160
 how they can have a job, how they can have an impact, how they can have a

5:02:10.160 --> 5:02:12.160
 life they could be proud of.

5:02:12.160 --> 5:02:14.160
 So it was kind of fun.

5:02:14.160 --> 5:02:18.160
 I got invited to give the commencement speech back at the I went to college

5:02:18.160 --> 5:02:23.160
 for two semesters and dropped out and went on to do my tech stuff.

5:02:23.160 --> 5:02:26.160
 But they still wanted me to come back and give a commencement speech.

5:02:26.160 --> 5:02:29.160
 And I've got that pinned on my Twitter account.

5:02:29.160 --> 5:02:32.160
 I still feel good about everything that I said there.

5:02:32.160 --> 5:02:37.160
 And my biggest point was that the path for me might not be the path for

5:02:37.160 --> 5:02:38.160
 everyone.

5:02:38.160 --> 5:02:42.160
 And in fact, the advice, the path that I took and even the advice that I

5:02:42.160 --> 5:02:47.160
 would give based on my experience and learnings probably isn't the best

5:02:47.160 --> 5:02:48.160
 advice for everyone.

5:02:48.160 --> 5:02:52.160
 Because what I did was all about this knowledge in depth.

5:02:52.160 --> 5:02:56.160
 It was about not just having this surface level ability to make things do

5:02:56.160 --> 5:02:59.160
 what I want, but to really understand them through and through.

5:02:59.160 --> 5:03:04.160
 To let me do the systems engineering work and to sometimes find these

5:03:04.160 --> 5:03:06.160
 inefficiencies that can be bypassed.

5:03:06.160 --> 5:03:09.160
 And the whole world doesn't need that.

5:03:09.160 --> 5:03:14.160
 Most programmers or engineers of any kind don't necessarily need to do that.

5:03:14.160 --> 5:03:17.160
 They need to do a little job that's been parceled out to them.

5:03:17.160 --> 5:03:18.160
 Be reliable.

5:03:18.160 --> 5:03:20.160
 Let people depend on you.

5:03:20.160 --> 5:03:22.160
 Do quality work with all of that.

5:03:22.160 --> 5:03:28.160
 But people that do have an inclination for wanting to know things deeper and

5:03:28.160 --> 5:03:34.160
 learn things deeper, there are just layers and layers of things out there.

5:03:34.160 --> 5:03:36.160
 And it's amazing.

5:03:36.160 --> 5:03:41.160
 If you're the right person that is excited about that, the world's never

5:03:41.160 --> 5:03:42.160
 been like this before.

5:03:42.160 --> 5:03:43.160
 It's better than ever.

5:03:43.160 --> 5:03:47.160
 I mean, everything that was wonderful for me is still there, and there's

5:03:47.160 --> 5:03:51.160
 whole new worlds to explore on the different things that you can do.

5:03:51.160 --> 5:03:54.160
 And that, you know, it's hard work.

5:03:54.160 --> 5:03:56.160
 Embrace the grind with it.

5:03:56.160 --> 5:03:59.160
 And understand as much as you can.

5:03:59.160 --> 5:04:03.160
 And then be prepared for opportunities to present themselves.

5:04:03.160 --> 5:04:07.160
 Where you can't just say this is my goal in life and just push at that.

5:04:07.160 --> 5:04:10.160
 I mean, you might be able to do that, but you're going to make more total

5:04:10.160 --> 5:04:15.160
 progress if you say I'm preparing myself with this broad set of tools.

5:04:15.160 --> 5:04:19.160
 And then I'm being aware of all the way things are changing as I move through

5:04:19.160 --> 5:04:22.160
 the world and as the whole world changes around me.

5:04:22.160 --> 5:04:26.160
 And then looking for opportunities to deploy the tools that you've built.

5:04:26.160 --> 5:04:31.160
 And there's going to be more and more of those types of things there where an

5:04:31.160 --> 5:04:35.160
 awareness of what's happening, where the inefficiencies are, what things can

5:04:35.160 --> 5:04:38.160
 be done, what's possible versus what's current practice.

5:04:38.160 --> 5:04:43.160
 And then finding those areas where you can go and make an adjustment and make

5:04:43.160 --> 5:04:47.160
 something that may affect millions or billions of people in the world.

5:04:47.160 --> 5:04:49.160
 Make it better.

5:04:49.160 --> 5:04:53.160
 When, maybe from your own example, how were you able to recognize this about

5:04:53.160 --> 5:04:58.160
 yourself that you saw the layers in a particular thing and you were drawn to

5:04:58.160 --> 5:05:01.160
 discovering deeper and deeper truths about it?

5:05:01.160 --> 5:05:05.160
 Is that something that was obvious to you that you couldn't help or is there some

5:05:05.160 --> 5:05:08.160
 actions you had to take to actually allow yourself to dig deep?

5:05:08.160 --> 5:05:12.160
 So in the earliest days of personal computers, I remember the reference

5:05:12.160 --> 5:05:16.160
 manuals and the very early ones even had schematics of computers in the

5:05:16.160 --> 5:05:21.160
 background, in the back of the books, as well as firmware listings and things.

5:05:21.160 --> 5:05:23.160
 And I could look at that.

5:05:23.160 --> 5:05:27.160
 And at that time, when I was a younger teenager, I didn't understand a lot of

5:05:27.160 --> 5:05:30.160
 that stuff, how the different things worked.

5:05:30.160 --> 5:05:34.160
 I was pulling out the information that I could get, but I always wanted to know

5:05:34.160 --> 5:05:35.160
 all of that.

5:05:35.160 --> 5:05:38.160
 There was kind of magical information sitting down there.

5:05:38.160 --> 5:05:43.160
 It's like the elder lore that some gray beard wizard is the keeper of.

5:05:43.160 --> 5:05:48.160
 And so I always felt that pull for wanting to know more, wanting to explore

5:05:48.160 --> 5:05:51.160
 the mysterious areas there.

5:05:51.160 --> 5:05:55.160
 And that followed right in through all the things that got the value,

5:05:55.160 --> 5:06:00.160
 exploring the video cards leading to the scrolling advantages,

5:06:00.160 --> 5:06:04.160
 exploring some of the academic papers and things, learning about BSP trees

5:06:04.160 --> 5:06:10.160
 and the different things that I could do with those systems and just the huge

5:06:10.160 --> 5:06:15.160
 larval phases going through aerospace, just reading bookshelves full of books.

5:06:15.160 --> 5:06:18.160
 Again, that point where I have enough money, I can buy all the books I want.

5:06:18.160 --> 5:06:23.160
 It was so valuable there where I was terrible with my money when I was a kid.

5:06:23.160 --> 5:06:27.160
 My mom thought I would always be broke because I'd buy my comic books

5:06:27.160 --> 5:06:28.160
 and just be out of money.

5:06:28.160 --> 5:06:32.160
 But it was like all the pizza I want, all the Diet Coke I want,

5:06:32.160 --> 5:06:34.160
 video games and then books.

5:06:34.160 --> 5:06:36.160
 And it didn't take that much.

5:06:36.160 --> 5:06:40.160
 As soon as I was making 27K a year, I felt rich and I was just getting

5:06:40.160 --> 5:06:42.160
 all the things that I wanted.

5:06:42.160 --> 5:06:46.160
 But that sense of books have always been magical to me.

5:06:46.160 --> 5:06:50.160
 And that was one of the things that really made me smile is Andre had said

5:06:50.160 --> 5:06:54.160
 when he came over to my house, he said he found my library inspiring.

5:06:54.160 --> 5:06:55.160
 And it was great to see.

5:06:55.160 --> 5:06:56.160
 I used to look at him.

5:06:56.160 --> 5:06:57.160
 He's kind of a younger guy.

5:06:57.160 --> 5:07:01.160
 I sometimes wonder if younger people these days have the same relationship

5:07:01.160 --> 5:07:06.160
 with books that I do where they were such a cornerstone for me in so many ways.

5:07:06.160 --> 5:07:08.160
 But that sense that, yeah, I always wanted to know it all.

5:07:08.160 --> 5:07:09.160
 I know I can't.

5:07:09.160 --> 5:07:11.160
 And that was like one of the last things I said.

5:07:11.160 --> 5:07:14.160
 You can't know everything, but you should convince yourself

5:07:14.160 --> 5:07:16.160
 that you can know anything.

5:07:16.160 --> 5:07:20.160
 Any one particular thing, it was created and discovered by humans.

5:07:20.160 --> 5:07:21.160
 You can learn it.

5:07:21.160 --> 5:07:23.160
 You can find out what you need on there.

5:07:23.160 --> 5:07:24.160
 And you can learn it deeply.

5:07:24.160 --> 5:07:25.160
 Yeah.

5:07:25.160 --> 5:07:29.160
 And you can drive a nail down through whatever layer cake problem space

5:07:29.160 --> 5:07:32.160
 you've got and learn a cross section there.

5:07:32.160 --> 5:07:34.160
 And not only can you have an impact doing that,

5:07:34.160 --> 5:07:37.160
 you can attain happiness doing that.

5:07:37.160 --> 5:07:41.160
 There's something so fulfilling about becoming a craftsman of a thing.

5:07:41.160 --> 5:07:42.160
 Yeah.

5:07:42.160 --> 5:07:45.160
 And I don't want to tell people that, look, this is a good career move.

5:07:45.160 --> 5:07:48.160
 Just grit your teeth and bear it.

5:07:48.160 --> 5:07:50.160
 You want people.

5:07:50.160 --> 5:07:54.160
 And I do think it is possible sometimes to find the joy in something.

5:07:54.160 --> 5:07:56.160
 Like it might not immediately appeal to you.

5:07:56.160 --> 5:08:00.160
 But I had told people early on, like in software times,

5:08:00.160 --> 5:08:04.160
 that a lot of game developers are in it just because they

5:08:04.160 --> 5:08:06.160
 are so passionate about games.

5:08:06.160 --> 5:08:10.160
 But I was always really more flexible in what appealed to me,

5:08:10.160 --> 5:08:14.160
 where I said, I think I could be quite engaged doing

5:08:14.160 --> 5:08:17.160
 operating system work or even database work.

5:08:17.160 --> 5:08:19.160
 I would find the interest in that.

5:08:19.160 --> 5:08:22.160
 Because I think most things that are significant in the world

5:08:22.160 --> 5:08:25.160
 have a lot of layers and complexity to them

5:08:25.160 --> 5:08:28.160
 and a lot of opportunities hidden within them.

5:08:28.160 --> 5:08:31.160
 So that would probably be the most important thing to encourage to people

5:08:31.160 --> 5:08:35.160
 is that you can weaponize curiosity.

5:08:35.160 --> 5:08:38.160
 You can deploy your curiosity to find,

5:08:38.160 --> 5:08:41.160
 to kind of like make things useful and valuable to you,

5:08:41.160 --> 5:08:44.160
 even if they don't immediately appear that way.

5:08:44.160 --> 5:08:45.160
 Deploy your curiosity.

5:08:45.160 --> 5:08:47.160
 Yeah, that's very true.

5:08:47.160 --> 5:08:49.160
 We've mentioned this debate point,

5:08:49.160 --> 5:08:55.160
 whether mortality or fear of mortality is fundamental to creating an AGI.

5:08:55.160 --> 5:08:58.160
 But let's talk about whether it's fundamental to human beings.

5:08:58.160 --> 5:09:01.160
 Do you think about your own mortality?

5:09:01.160 --> 5:09:03.160
 I really don't.

5:09:03.160 --> 5:09:07.160
 And you probably always have to like take with a grain of salt

5:09:07.160 --> 5:09:10.160
 anything somebody says about fundamental things like that.

5:09:10.160 --> 5:09:16.160
 But I don't think about really aging, impending death,

5:09:16.160 --> 5:09:20.160
 having a legacy with my children, things like that.

5:09:20.160 --> 5:09:25.160
 And clearly it seems most of the world does a lot more than I do.

5:09:25.160 --> 5:09:32.160
 So I mean I think I'm an outlier in that where it doesn't wind up

5:09:32.160 --> 5:09:36.160
 being a real part of my thinking and motivation about things.

5:09:36.160 --> 5:09:41.160
 So daily existence is about sort of the people you love

5:09:41.160 --> 5:09:44.160
 and the problems before you.

5:09:44.160 --> 5:09:47.160
 And I'm focused on what I'm working on right now.

5:09:47.160 --> 5:09:49.160
 I do take that back.

5:09:49.160 --> 5:09:54.160
 There's one aspect where the kind of finiteness of the life does impact me,

5:09:54.160 --> 5:09:58.160
 and that is about thinking about the scope of the problems that I'm working on.

5:09:58.160 --> 5:10:03.160
 When I decided to work on it, when I was like nuclear fission or AGI,

5:10:03.160 --> 5:10:09.160
 these are big ticket things that impact large fractions of the world.

5:10:09.160 --> 5:10:12.160
 And I was thinking to myself at some level that, okay,

5:10:12.160 --> 5:10:17.160
 I may have a couple more swings at bat with me at full capability,

5:10:17.160 --> 5:10:23.160
 but yes, my mental abilities will decay with age, mostly inevitably.

5:10:23.160 --> 5:10:26.160
 I don't think it's a 0% chance that we will address some of that

5:10:26.160 --> 5:10:28.160
 before it becomes a problem for me.

5:10:28.160 --> 5:10:31.160
 I think exciting medical stuff in the next couple decades.

5:10:31.160 --> 5:10:36.160
 But I do have this kind of vague plan that when I'm not at the top of my game

5:10:36.160 --> 5:10:40.160
 and I don't feel that I'm in a position to put a dent in the world some way,

5:10:40.160 --> 5:10:44.160
 that I'll probably wind up doing some kind of recreational retro programming

5:10:44.160 --> 5:10:50.160
 or I'll work on something that I would not devote my life to now,

5:10:50.160 --> 5:10:56.160
 but I can while away my time as the old man gardening in the code worlds.

5:10:56.160 --> 5:11:01.160
 And then to step back even bigger, let me ask you about why we're here,

5:11:01.160 --> 5:11:03.160
 we human beings.

5:11:03.160 --> 5:11:05.160
 What's the meaning of it all?

5:11:05.160 --> 5:11:07.160
 What's the meaning of life, John Carmack?

5:11:07.160 --> 5:11:09.160
 So very similar with that last question.

5:11:09.160 --> 5:11:12.160
 I know a lot of people fret about this question a lot,

5:11:12.160 --> 5:11:14.160
 and I just really don't.

5:11:14.160 --> 5:11:16.160
 I really don't give a damn.

5:11:16.160 --> 5:11:21.160
 We are biological creatures that happenstance of evolution.

5:11:21.160 --> 5:11:25.160
 We have innate drives that evolution crafted for survival

5:11:25.160 --> 5:11:28.160
 and passing on of genetic codes.

5:11:28.160 --> 5:11:34.160
 I don't find a lot of value in trying to go much deeper than that.

5:11:34.160 --> 5:11:38.160
 I have my motivations, some of which are probably genetically coded

5:11:38.160 --> 5:11:41.160
 and many of which are contingent on my upbringing

5:11:41.160 --> 5:11:44.160
 and the path that I've had through my life.

5:11:44.160 --> 5:11:48.160
 I don't run into like spades of depression or envy

5:11:48.160 --> 5:11:52.160
 or anything that winds up being a challenge

5:11:52.160 --> 5:11:55.160
 and forcing a degree of soul searching with things like that.

5:11:55.160 --> 5:12:00.160
 I seem to be okay kind of without that.

5:12:00.160 --> 5:12:04.160
 As a brilliant ant in the ant colony without looking up to the sky

5:12:04.160 --> 5:12:07.160
 wondering why the hell am I here again.

5:12:07.160 --> 5:12:15.160
 So the why of it, the incredible mystery of the fact that we started,

5:12:15.160 --> 5:12:18.160
 first of all, the origin of life on Earth,

5:12:18.160 --> 5:12:21.160
 and from that, from single cell organisms,

5:12:21.160 --> 5:12:24.160
 the entirety of the evolutionary process took us somehow

5:12:24.160 --> 5:12:29.160
 to this incredibly intelligent thing that is able to build Wolfenstein 3D

5:12:29.160 --> 5:12:34.160
 and Doom and Quake and take a crack at the problem of AGI

5:12:34.160 --> 5:12:37.160
 and things that eventually supersede human beings.

5:12:37.160 --> 5:12:42.160
 That doesn't, the why of it is...

5:12:42.160 --> 5:12:46.160
 It's been my experience that people that focus on,

5:12:46.160 --> 5:12:49.160
 that don't focus on the here and now right in front of them

5:12:49.160 --> 5:12:51.160
 tend to be less effective.

5:12:51.160 --> 5:12:55.160
 I mean, it's not 100%, you know, vision matters to some people,

5:12:55.160 --> 5:12:59.160
 but it doesn't seem to be a necessary motivator for me

5:12:59.160 --> 5:13:03.160
 and I think that the process of getting there is usually done.

5:13:03.160 --> 5:13:05.160
 It's like the magic of gradient descent.

5:13:05.160 --> 5:13:08.160
 People just don't believe that just looking locally

5:13:08.160 --> 5:13:11.160
 gets you to all of these spectacular things.

5:13:11.160 --> 5:13:15.160
 That's been, you know, the decades of looking at

5:13:15.160 --> 5:13:17.160
 really some of the smartest people in the world

5:13:17.160 --> 5:13:20.160
 that would just push back forever against this idea

5:13:20.160 --> 5:13:24.160
 that it's not this grand, sophisticated vision of everything,

5:13:24.160 --> 5:13:27.160
 but little tiny steps, local information winds up

5:13:27.160 --> 5:13:29.160
 leading to all the best answers.

5:13:29.160 --> 5:13:34.160
 So the meaning of life is following locally

5:13:34.160 --> 5:13:37.160
 wherever the gradient descent takes you.

5:13:37.160 --> 5:13:39.160
 This was an incredible conversation,

5:13:39.160 --> 5:13:43.160
 officially the longest conversation I've ever done on the podcast,

5:13:43.160 --> 5:13:46.160
 which means a lot to me because I get to do it with one of my heroes.

5:13:46.160 --> 5:13:48.160
 John, I can't tell you how much it means to me

5:13:48.160 --> 5:13:50.160
 that you would sit down with me.

5:13:50.160 --> 5:13:52.160
 You're an incredible human being.

5:13:52.160 --> 5:13:55.160
 I can't wait what you do next, but you've already changed the world.

5:13:55.160 --> 5:13:57.160
 You're an inspiration to so many people.

5:13:57.160 --> 5:14:02.160
 And again, we haven't covered like most of what I was planning to talk about,

5:14:02.160 --> 5:14:06.160
 so I hope we get a chance to talk someday in the future.

5:14:06.160 --> 5:14:08.160
 I can't wait to see what you do next.

5:14:08.160 --> 5:14:10.160
 Thank you so much again for talking to me.

5:14:10.160 --> 5:14:11.160
 Thank you very much.

5:14:11.160 --> 5:14:14.160
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with John Carmack.

5:14:14.160 --> 5:14:18.160
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

5:14:18.160 --> 5:14:22.160
 And now, let me leave you with some words from John Carmack himself.

5:14:22.160 --> 5:14:26.160
 Focused hard work is the real key to success.

5:14:26.160 --> 5:14:28.160
 Keep your eyes on the goal,

5:14:28.160 --> 5:14:31.160
 and just keep taking the next step towards completing it.

5:14:31.160 --> 5:14:34.160
 If you aren't sure which way to do something,

5:14:34.160 --> 5:14:37.160
 do it both ways and see which works better.

5:14:37.160 --> 5:14:56.160
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
