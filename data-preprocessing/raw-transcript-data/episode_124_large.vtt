00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
 The following is a conversation with Stephen Wolfram,

00:02.800 --> 00:05.080
 his second time on the podcast.

00:05.080 --> 00:07.240
 He's a computer scientist, mathematician,

00:07.240 --> 00:10.640
 theoretical physicist, and the founder and CEO

00:10.640 --> 00:14.400
 of Wolfram Research, a company behind Mathematica,

00:14.400 --> 00:16.680
 Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Language,

00:16.680 --> 00:19.200
 and the new Wolfram Physics Project.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.240
 He's the author of several books,

00:21.240 --> 00:24.600
 including A New Kind of Science, and the new book,

00:24.600 --> 00:28.280
 A Project to Find the Fundamental Theory of Physics.

00:28.280 --> 00:30.920
 This second round of our conversation is primarily focused

00:30.920 --> 00:33.880
 on this latter endeavor of searching for the physics

00:33.880 --> 00:37.200
 of our universe in simple rules that do their work

00:37.200 --> 00:40.920
 on hypergraphs and eventually generate the infrastructure

00:40.920 --> 00:45.420
 from which space, time, and all of modern physics can emerge.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.200
 Quick summary of the sponsors,

00:47.200 --> 00:50.240
 SimpliSafe, Sunbasket, and Masterclass.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.880
 Please check out these sponsors in the description

00:52.880 --> 00:55.960
 to get a discount and to support this podcast.

00:55.960 --> 00:58.680
 As a side note, let me say that to me,

00:58.680 --> 01:02.040
 the idea that seemingly infinite complexity can arise

01:02.040 --> 01:05.080
 from very simple rules and initial conditions

01:05.080 --> 01:07.720
 is one of the most beautiful and important

01:07.720 --> 01:10.440
 mathematical and philosophical mysteries in science.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.400
 I find that both cellular automata

01:12.400 --> 01:14.920
 and the hypergraph data structure

01:14.920 --> 01:17.360
 that Stephen and team are currently working on

01:17.360 --> 01:21.080
 to be the kind of simple, clear mathematical playground

01:21.080 --> 01:24.560
 within which fundamental ideas about intelligence,

01:24.560 --> 01:28.400
 consciousness, and the fundamental laws of physics

01:28.400 --> 01:31.680
 can be further developed in totally new ways.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.320
 In fact, I think I'll try to make a video or two

01:34.320 --> 01:37.480
 about the most beautiful aspects of these models

01:37.480 --> 01:40.200
 in the coming weeks, especially, I think,

01:40.200 --> 01:43.320
 trying to describe how fellow curious minds like myself

01:43.320 --> 01:47.440
 can jump in and explore them either just for fun

01:47.440 --> 01:51.700
 or potentially for publication of new innovative research

01:51.700 --> 01:54.080
 in math, computer science, and physics.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.320
 But honestly, I think the emerging complexity

01:56.320 --> 01:58.920
 in these hypergraphs can capture the imagination

01:58.920 --> 02:00.880
 of everyone, even if you're someone

02:00.880 --> 02:04.040
 who never really connected with mathematics.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.780
 That's my hope, at least, to have these conversations

02:06.780 --> 02:09.840
 that inspire everyone to look up to the skies

02:09.840 --> 02:14.840
 and into our own minds in awe of our amazing universe.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.840
 Let me also mention that this is the first time

02:17.840 --> 02:20.360
 I ever recorded a podcast outdoors

02:20.360 --> 02:23.520
 as a kind of experiment to see if this is an option

02:23.520 --> 02:25.360
 in times of COVID.

02:25.360 --> 02:27.840
 I'm sorry if the audio is not great.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.580
 I did my best and promise to keep improving

02:30.580 --> 02:32.640
 and learning as always.

02:32.640 --> 02:35.040

02:42.880 --> 02:44.960
 As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now

02:44.960 --> 02:46.920
 and no ads in the middle.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.440
 I tried to make these interesting,

02:48.440 --> 02:52.240
 but I do give you timestamps, so you're welcome to skip,

02:52.240 --> 02:54.360
 but still, please do check out the sponsors

02:54.360 --> 02:56.600

02:56.600 --> 02:59.560
 It's the best way to support this podcast.

02:59.560 --> 03:02.800
 Also, let me say, even though I'm talking way too much,

03:02.800 --> 03:06.580
 that I did a survey and it seems like over 90% of people

03:06.580 --> 03:09.880
 either enjoy these ad reads somehow magically

03:09.880 --> 03:11.800
 or don't mind them, at least.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.320
 That honestly just warms my heart

03:14.320 --> 03:16.160
 that people are that supportive.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.580
 This show is sponsored by SimpliSafe,

03:18.580 --> 03:20.280
 a home security company.

 It's simple, no contracts, 15 bucks a month, easy setup.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.600
 Even I figured it out.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.600
 I have it set up in my apartment.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.280
 Of course, I also welcome intruders.

03:34.280 --> 03:38.300
 One of my favorite movies is Leon or The Professional

03:38.300 --> 03:40.580
 with Jean Reno, Gary Oldman,

03:40.580 --> 03:43.380
 and the brilliant young Natalie Portman.

03:43.380 --> 03:44.280
 If you haven't seen the movie,

03:44.280 --> 03:48.800
 he's a hit man with a minimalist life that resembles my own.

03:48.800 --> 03:52.600
 In fact, when I was younger, the idea of being a hit man

03:52.600 --> 03:56.420
 or targeting evil in a skilled way,

03:56.420 --> 03:59.640
 which is how I thought about it, really appealed to me.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.860
 The skill of it, the planning, the craftsmanship.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.280
 In another life, perhaps,

04:05.280 --> 04:07.840
 if I didn't love engineering and science so much,

04:07.840 --> 04:10.760
 I could see myself being something like a Navy SEAL.

04:10.760 --> 04:14.080
 And in general, I love the idea of serving my country,

04:14.080 --> 04:16.700
 of serving society by contributing my skill

04:16.700 --> 04:18.500
 in some small way.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.240

 that they decide to support this podcast long term.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.400
 Their meals are healthy and delicious,

04:54.400 --> 04:56.960
 a nice break from the minimalist meals of meat

04:56.960 --> 04:59.640
 and vegetables that I usually eat.

04:59.640 --> 05:00.840
 Maybe on a personal note,

05:00.840 --> 05:03.720
 one of my favorite things to do is watch people cook,

05:03.720 --> 05:05.800
 especially people who love cooking,

05:05.800 --> 05:09.080
 and hang out with people over amazing meals.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.640
 I still tend to be strict in my diet no matter what,

05:11.640 --> 05:12.940
 even in fancy restaurants,

05:12.940 --> 05:17.140
 but it brings me joy to see friends and family indulge

05:17.140 --> 05:20.760
 something like a cake that has way too many calories

05:20.760 --> 05:22.640
 or ice cream or whatever.

05:22.640 --> 05:24.920
 My mom, in fact, for much of my life,

05:24.920 --> 05:27.760
 made this cake called an anthill on my birthday

05:27.760 --> 05:32.500
 that brings me a lot of joy and way too many calories.

05:32.500 --> 05:36.480
 I was thinking of doing a video with my mom as she makes it.

05:36.480 --> 05:39.500
 I thought it'd be a fun thing to do together.

05:39.500 --> 05:44.020
 Anyway, go to SunBasket.com slash Lex and use code LEX.

05:44.020 --> 05:45.280

 Neil deGrasse Tyson, Tony Hawk, Carlos Santana,

06:02.100 --> 06:03.920
 Garrett Casparov, Daniel Nagano,

06:03.920 --> 06:07.220
 and many more brilliant world experts.

06:07.220 --> 06:10.260
 Masterclass has been a really special sponsor.

06:10.260 --> 06:13.280
 They believe in this podcast in a way that gives me strength

06:13.280 --> 06:16.360
 and motivation to take intellectual risks.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.880
 I'm thinking of doing a few solo podcast episodes

06:18.880 --> 06:22.240
 on difficult topics, especially in history,

06:22.240 --> 06:26.520
 like the rise and fall of the Third Reich or Stalin, Putin,

06:26.520 --> 06:29.560
 and many other difficult topics that I'm fascinated by.

06:29.560 --> 06:33.120
 I have a worldview that seeks inspiring positive insights,

06:33.120 --> 06:38.120
 even and perhaps especially from periods of tragedy and evil

06:38.240 --> 06:40.800
 that perhaps some folks may find value in.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.640
 If I can only learn to convey the ideas in my mind

06:43.640 --> 06:45.800
 as clearly as I think them.

06:45.800 --> 06:50.520
 I think deeply and rigorously and precisely,

06:50.520 --> 06:53.520
 but to be honest, have trouble speaking in a way

06:53.520 --> 06:56.800
 that reflects that rigor of thought.

06:56.800 --> 07:00.160
 So it really does mean a lot, the love and support I get

07:00.160 --> 07:02.040
 as I try to get better at this thing,

07:02.040 --> 07:03.880
 at this talking thing.

07:03.880 --> 07:07.400
 Anyway, go to masterclass.com slash LEX to get a discount

07:07.400 --> 07:09.400

07:09.400 --> 07:13.800
 And now finally, here's my conversation with Stephen Wolfram.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.420
 You said that there are moments in history of physics

07:17.420 --> 07:20.200
 and maybe mathematical physics or even mathematics

07:20.200 --> 07:22.460
 where breakthroughs happen

07:22.460 --> 07:24.800
 and then a flurry of progress follows.

07:24.800 --> 07:28.320
 So if you look back through the history of physics,

07:28.320 --> 07:32.240
 what moments stand out to you as important such breakthroughs

07:32.240 --> 07:34.560
 where a flurry of progress follows?

07:34.560 --> 07:36.880
 So the big famous one was 1920s,

07:36.880 --> 07:38.960
 the invention of quantum mechanics,

07:38.960 --> 07:41.960
 where in about five or 10 years,

07:41.960 --> 07:43.720
 lots of stuff got figured out.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.040
 That's now quantum mechanics.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.600
 Can you mention the people involved?

07:46.600 --> 07:50.640
 Yeah, it was kind of the Schrodinger, Heisenberg,

07:50.640 --> 07:53.900
 Einstein had been a key figure, originally Planck,

07:53.900 --> 07:56.560
 then Dirac was a little bit later.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.160
 That was something that happened at that time,

07:58.160 --> 08:00.440
 that's sort of before my time, right?

08:00.440 --> 08:04.040
 In my time was in the 1970s,

08:04.040 --> 08:06.320
 there was this sort of realization

08:06.320 --> 08:09.080
 that quantum field theory was actually going to be useful

08:09.080 --> 08:13.040
 in physics and QCD, quantum thermodynamics theory

08:13.040 --> 08:16.080
 of quarks and gluons and so on was really getting started.

08:16.080 --> 08:19.800
 And there was again, sort of big flurry of things

08:19.800 --> 08:22.440
 happened then, I happened to be a teenager at that time

08:22.440 --> 08:26.540
 and happened to be really involved in physics.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.760
 And so I got to be part of that, which was really cool.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.100
 Who were the key figures

08:31.100 --> 08:33.880
 aside from your young selves at that time?

08:33.880 --> 08:37.040
 You know, who won the Nobel Prize for QCD, okay?

08:37.040 --> 08:41.440
 People, David Gross, Frank Wilczek, you know, David Politzer.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.000
 The people who are the sort of the slightly older generation,

08:44.000 --> 08:47.080
 Dick Feynman, Murray Gellman, people like that,

08:48.520 --> 08:52.760
 who were Steve Weinberg, Gerhard Hoft, he's younger,

08:52.760 --> 08:54.800
 he's in the younger group actually.

08:54.800 --> 08:59.240
 But these are all, you know, characters who were involved.

08:59.240 --> 09:02.540
 I mean, it's funny because those are all people

09:02.540 --> 09:05.040
 who are kind of in my time and I know them

09:05.040 --> 09:08.820
 and they don't seem like sort of historical,

09:08.820 --> 09:10.140
 you know, iconic figures.

09:10.140 --> 09:14.480
 They seem more like everyday characters, so to speak.

09:14.480 --> 09:18.040
 And so it's always, you know, when you look at history

09:18.040 --> 09:21.480
 from long afterwards, it always seems like

09:21.480 --> 09:23.100
 everything happened instantly.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.680
 And that's usually not the case.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.360
 There was usually a long buildup,

09:27.360 --> 09:28.600
 but usually there's, you know,

09:28.600 --> 09:30.920
 there's some methodological thing happens

09:30.920 --> 09:32.560
 and then there's a whole bunch of low hanging fruit

09:32.560 --> 09:33.800
 to be picked.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.360
 And that usually lasts five or 10 years.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.760
 You know, we see it today with machine learning

09:38.760 --> 09:42.640
 and, you know, deep learning neural nets and so on.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.440
 You know, methodological advance,

09:44.440 --> 09:47.480
 things actually started working in, you know, 2011, 2012

09:47.480 --> 09:48.440
 and so on.

09:48.440 --> 09:51.680
 And, you know, there's been this sort of rapid

09:51.680 --> 09:55.560
 picking of low hanging fruit, which is probably, you know,

09:56.520 --> 10:00.080
 some significant fraction of the way done, so to speak.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.600
 Do you think there's a key moment?

10:01.600 --> 10:03.120
 Like if I had to really introspect,

10:03.120 --> 10:04.680
 like what was the key moment

10:04.680 --> 10:08.040
 for the deep learning, quote unquote, revolution?

10:08.040 --> 10:08.860
 I mean.

10:08.860 --> 10:10.120
 It's probably the AlexNet business.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.480
 AlexNet with ImageNet.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.840
 So is there something like that with physics

10:13.840 --> 10:18.080
 where, so deep learning neural networks

10:18.080 --> 10:19.880
 have been around for a long time.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.000
 Absolutely, since the 1940s, yeah.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.960
 There's a bunch of little pieces that came together

10:23.960 --> 10:27.480
 and then all of a sudden everybody's eyes lit up.

10:27.480 --> 10:29.820
 Like, wow, there's something here.

10:29.820 --> 10:32.520
 Like even just looking at your own work,

10:32.520 --> 10:34.360
 just your thinking about the universe,

10:34.360 --> 10:38.900
 that there's simple rules can create complexity.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.880
 You know, at which point was there a thing

10:42.880 --> 10:45.120
 where your eyes light up?

10:45.120 --> 10:46.520
 It's like, wait a minute, there's something here.

10:46.520 --> 10:49.480
 Is it the very first idea

10:49.480 --> 10:53.360
 or is it some moment along the line of implementations

10:53.360 --> 10:54.640
 and experiments and so on?

10:54.640 --> 10:56.380
 There's a couple of different stages to this.

10:56.380 --> 11:01.080
 I mean, one is the think about the world computationally.

11:01.080 --> 11:03.880
 Can we use programs instead of equations

11:03.880 --> 11:05.880
 to make models of the world?

11:05.880 --> 11:07.760
 That's something that I got interested in

11:07.760 --> 11:10.400
 in the beginning of the 1980s.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.040
 I did a bunch of computer experiments.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.820
 When I first did them, I didn't really,

11:15.820 --> 11:17.520
 I could see some significance to them,

11:17.520 --> 11:20.000
 but it took me a few years to really say,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.880
 wow, there's a big important phenomenon here

11:22.880 --> 11:25.400
 that lets sort of complex things arise

11:25.400 --> 11:27.360
 from very simple programs.

11:27.360 --> 11:30.560
 That kind of happened back in 1984 or so.

11:30.560 --> 11:33.000
 Then, you know, a bunch of other years go by,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.520
 then I start actually doing a lot

11:35.520 --> 11:37.720
 of much more systematic computer experiments and things

11:37.720 --> 11:39.280
 and find out that the, you know,

11:39.280 --> 11:41.520
 this phenomenon that I could only have said occurs

11:41.520 --> 11:43.040
 in one particular case

11:43.040 --> 11:45.120
 is actually something incredibly general.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.560
 And then that led me to this thing called

11:46.560 --> 11:48.680
 principle of computational equivalence.

11:48.680 --> 11:51.120
 And that was a long story.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.920
 And then, you know, as part of that process,

11:53.920 --> 11:56.880
 I was like, okay, you can make simple programs,

11:56.880 --> 11:59.240
 can make models of complicated things.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.720
 What about the whole universe?

12:00.720 --> 12:03.760
 That's our sort of ultimate example of a complicated thing.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.080
 And so I got to thinking, you know,

12:05.080 --> 12:10.080
 could we use these ideas to study fundamental physics?

12:10.240 --> 12:11.960
 You know, I happen to know a lot about,

12:11.960 --> 12:14.160
 you know, traditional fundamental physics.

12:14.160 --> 12:17.320
 My first, you know, I had a bunch of ideas

12:17.320 --> 12:19.360
 about how to do this in the early 1990s.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.080
 I made a bunch of technical progress.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.120
 I figured out a bunch of things

12:22.120 --> 12:23.880
 I thought were pretty interesting.

12:23.880 --> 12:26.600
 You know, I wrote about them back in 2002.

12:26.600 --> 12:27.800
 With the new kind of science

12:27.800 --> 12:29.200
 in the cellular automata world.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.200
 And there's echoes in the cellular automata world

12:32.200 --> 12:36.680
 with your new Wolfram physics project.

12:36.680 --> 12:37.640
 We'll get to all that.

12:37.640 --> 12:40.280
 Allow me to sort of romanticize a little more

12:40.280 --> 12:41.960
 on the philosophy of science.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.600
 So Thomas Kuhn, philosopher of science,

12:45.600 --> 12:49.440
 describes that, you know, the progress in science

12:49.440 --> 12:52.160
 is made with these paradigm shifts.

12:52.160 --> 12:56.920
 And so to link on the sort of original line of discussion,

12:56.920 --> 12:58.120
 do you agree with this view

12:58.120 --> 13:01.520
 that there is revolutions in science

13:01.520 --> 13:03.400
 that just kind of flip the table?

13:03.400 --> 13:05.920
 What happens is it's a different way

13:05.920 --> 13:07.000
 of thinking about things.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.920
 It's a different methodology for studying things.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.720
 And that opens stuff up.

13:11.720 --> 13:13.240
 There's this idea of,

13:15.400 --> 13:16.840
 he's a famous biographer,

13:16.840 --> 13:19.640
 but I think it's called the innovators.

13:19.640 --> 13:22.680
 There's a biographer of Steve Jobs, of Albert Einstein.

13:22.680 --> 13:23.640
 He also wrote a book,

13:23.640 --> 13:24.800
 I think it's called the innovators,

13:24.800 --> 13:29.800
 where he discusses how a lot of the innovations

13:30.240 --> 13:33.840
 in the history of computing has been done by groups.

13:33.840 --> 13:37.320
 There's a complicated group dynamic going on,

13:37.320 --> 13:39.360
 but there's also a romanticized notion

13:39.360 --> 13:42.800
 that the individual is at the core of the revolution.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.280
 Like where does your sense fall?

13:45.280 --> 13:49.880
 Is ultimately like one person responsible

13:49.880 --> 13:52.680
 for these revolutions that creates the spark

13:52.680 --> 13:54.600
 or one or two, whatever,

13:54.600 --> 13:58.760
 or is it just the big mush and mess and chaos

13:58.760 --> 14:01.360
 of people interacting, of personalities interacting?

14:01.360 --> 14:03.120
 I think it ends up being like many things,

14:03.120 --> 14:05.360
 there's leadership and there ends up being,

14:05.360 --> 14:08.080
 it's a lot easier for one person to have a crisp new idea

14:08.080 --> 14:10.840
 than it is for a big committee to have a crisp new idea.

14:10.840 --> 14:13.720
 And I think, but I think it can happen

14:13.720 --> 14:16.440
 that you have a great idea,

14:16.440 --> 14:19.120
 but the world isn't ready for it.

14:19.120 --> 14:24.040
 And you can, I mean, this has happened to me plenty, right?

14:24.040 --> 14:27.200
 It's, you have an idea, it's actually a pretty good idea,

14:27.200 --> 14:29.240
 but things aren't ready,

14:29.240 --> 14:31.680
 either you're not really ready for it,

14:31.680 --> 14:34.480
 or the ambient world isn't ready for it.

14:34.480 --> 14:37.880
 And it's hard to get the thing to get traction.

14:37.880 --> 14:38.720
 It's kind of interesting.

14:38.720 --> 14:41.720
 I mean, when I look at a new kind of science,

14:41.720 --> 14:43.640
 you're now living inside the history,

14:43.640 --> 14:46.680
 so you can't tell the story of these decades,

14:46.680 --> 14:49.640
 but it seems like the new kind of science

14:49.640 --> 14:54.640
 has not had the revolutionary impact

14:55.200 --> 14:59.120
 I would think it might.

14:59.120 --> 15:02.640
 Like, it feels like at some point, of course it might be,

15:02.640 --> 15:06.240
 but it feels at some point people will return to that book

15:07.120 --> 15:09.600
 and say, that was something special here.

15:09.600 --> 15:10.880
 This was incredible.

15:10.880 --> 15:11.840
 What happened?

15:11.840 --> 15:13.560
 Or do you think that's already happened?

15:13.560 --> 15:16.400
 Oh, yeah, it's happened, except that people aren't,

15:16.400 --> 15:19.480
 the sort of the heroism of it may not be there,

15:19.480 --> 15:22.760
 but what's happened is for 300 years,

15:22.760 --> 15:24.520
 people basically said,

15:24.520 --> 15:27.040
 if you want to make a model of things in the world,

15:27.040 --> 15:29.760
 mathematical equations are the best place to go.

15:29.760 --> 15:32.480
 Last 15 years, doesn't happen.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.600
 New models that get made of things

15:34.600 --> 15:38.600
 most often are made with programs, not with equations.

15:38.600 --> 15:42.320
 Now, was that sort of going to happen anyway?

15:42.320 --> 15:45.600
 Was that a consequence of my particular work

15:45.600 --> 15:47.240
 and my particular book?

15:47.240 --> 15:48.800
 It's hard to know for sure.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.560
 I mean, I am always amazed at the amounts of feedback

15:51.560 --> 15:52.960
 that I get from people where they say,

15:52.960 --> 15:56.080
 oh, by the way, I started doing this whole line of research

15:56.080 --> 15:58.520
 because I read your book, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

15:58.520 --> 15:59.920
 It's like, well, can you tell that

15:59.920 --> 16:01.880
 from the academic literature?

16:01.880 --> 16:04.520
 Was there a chain of academic references?

16:04.520 --> 16:05.800
 Probably not.

16:05.800 --> 16:09.040
 One of the interesting side effects of publishing

16:09.040 --> 16:11.920
 in the way you did this tome

16:11.920 --> 16:15.320
 is it serves as an education tool and an inspiration

16:15.320 --> 16:19.200
 to hundreds of thousands, millions of people,

16:19.200 --> 16:21.680
 but because it's not a single,

16:21.680 --> 16:25.200
 it's not a chain of papers with spiffy titles,

16:25.200 --> 16:29.320
 it doesn't create a splash of citations.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.440
 It's had plenty of citations, but it's, you know,

16:31.440 --> 16:36.440
 I think that people think of it as probably more,

16:36.440 --> 16:41.440
 you know, conceptual inspiration than kind of a,

16:41.640 --> 16:43.880
 you know, this is a line from here to here to here

16:43.880 --> 16:45.440
 in our particular field.

16:45.440 --> 16:49.520
 I think that the thing which I am disappointed by

16:49.520 --> 16:51.440
 and which will eventually happen

16:51.440 --> 16:55.840
 is this kind of study of the sort of pure computationalism,

16:55.840 --> 16:58.600
 this kind of study of the abstract behavior

16:58.600 --> 17:00.520
 of the computational universe.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.960
 That should be a big thing that lots of people do.

17:03.960 --> 17:06.320
 You mean in mathematics purely, almost like.

17:06.320 --> 17:08.840
 It's like pure mathematics, but it isn't mathematics.

17:08.840 --> 17:10.440
 But it isn't, it isn't.

17:10.440 --> 17:12.320
 It's a new kind of mathematics.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.360
 Is it a new title of the book?

17:14.360 --> 17:15.200
 Yeah, right.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.040
 That's why the book is called that.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.160
 Right, that's not coincidental.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.160
 Yeah.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.840
 It's interesting that I haven't seen

17:22.840 --> 17:24.960
 really rigorous investigation

17:24.960 --> 17:26.880
 by thousands of people of this idea.

17:26.880 --> 17:30.080
 I mean, you look at your competition around rule 30.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.320
 I mean, that's fascinating.

17:31.320 --> 17:34.320
 If you can say something.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.160
 Right.

17:35.160 --> 17:38.800
 Is there some aspect of this thing that could be predicted?

17:38.800 --> 17:40.960
 That's the fundamental question of science.

17:40.960 --> 17:41.800
 That's the core.

17:41.800 --> 17:42.880
 Well, that has been a question of science.

17:42.880 --> 17:47.440
 I think that is some people's view of what science is about

17:47.440 --> 17:48.960
 and it's not clear that's the right view.

17:48.960 --> 17:51.520
 In fact, as we live through this pandemic

17:51.520 --> 17:53.320
 full of predictions and so on,

17:53.320 --> 17:55.360
 it's an interesting moment to be pondering

17:55.360 --> 17:58.440
 what science's actual role in those kinds of things is.

17:58.440 --> 18:02.080
 Or you think it's possible that in science,

18:02.080 --> 18:04.920
 clean, beautiful, simple prediction

18:04.920 --> 18:07.240
 may not even be possible in real systems.

18:07.240 --> 18:08.800
 That's the open question.

18:08.800 --> 18:09.640
 I don't think it's open.

18:09.640 --> 18:12.240
 I think that question is answered and the answer is no.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.120
 Well, no, no.

18:13.120 --> 18:16.680
 The answer could be just humans are not smart enough yet.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.520
 Like we don't have the tools yet.

18:17.520 --> 18:18.680
 No, that's the whole point.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.680
 I mean, that's sort of the big discovery

18:20.680 --> 18:23.320
 of this principle of computational equivalence of mine.

18:23.320 --> 18:26.880
 And this is something which is kind of a follow on

18:26.880 --> 18:28.920
 to Gödel's theorem, to Turing's work

18:28.920 --> 18:31.680
 on the halting problem, all these kinds of things.

18:31.680 --> 18:34.720
 That there is this fundamental limitation

18:34.720 --> 18:36.360
 built into science,

18:36.360 --> 18:39.120
 this idea of computational irreducibility

18:39.120 --> 18:42.480
 that says that even though you may know the rules

18:42.480 --> 18:44.160
 by which something operates,

18:44.160 --> 18:47.600
 that does not mean that you can readily sort of

18:47.600 --> 18:49.760
 be smarter than it and jump ahead

18:49.760 --> 18:51.640
 and figure out what it's going to do.

18:51.640 --> 18:53.800
 Yes, but do you think there's a hope

18:53.800 --> 18:56.960
 for pockets of computational reducibility?

18:56.960 --> 19:00.480
 Computational reducibility.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.840
 And then a set of tools and mathematics

19:04.840 --> 19:07.040
 that help you discover such pockets.

19:07.040 --> 19:10.160
 That's where we live is in the pockets of reducibility.

19:10.160 --> 19:12.560
 That's why, and this is one of the things

19:12.560 --> 19:14.080
 that sort of come out of this physics project

19:14.080 --> 19:15.480
 and actually something that, again,

19:15.480 --> 19:18.680
 I should have realized many years ago, but didn't,

19:18.680 --> 19:23.440
 is it could very well be that everything about the world

19:23.440 --> 19:26.560
 is computationally reducible and completely unpredictable.

19:26.560 --> 19:29.720
 But in our experience of the world,

19:29.720 --> 19:32.520
 there is at least some amount of prediction we can make.

19:32.520 --> 19:36.560
 And that's because we have sort of chosen a slice of,

19:36.560 --> 19:38.320
 probably talk about this in much more detail,

19:38.320 --> 19:39.920
 but I mean, we've kind of chosen a slice

19:39.920 --> 19:41.760
 of how to think about the universe

19:41.760 --> 19:43.960
 in which we can kind of sample

19:43.960 --> 19:46.640
 a certain amount of computational reducibility.

19:46.640 --> 19:51.640
 And that's sort of where we exist.

19:51.640 --> 19:55.920
 And it may not be the whole story of how the universe is,

19:55.920 --> 19:59.240
 but it is the part of the universe that we care about

19:59.240 --> 20:01.000
 and we sort of operate in.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.600
 And that's, you know, in science,

20:03.600 --> 20:05.720
 that's been sort of a very special case of that.

20:05.720 --> 20:09.360
 That is science has chosen to talk a lot about places

20:09.360 --> 20:12.120
 where there is this computational reducibility

20:12.120 --> 20:13.640
 that it can find, you know,

20:13.640 --> 20:16.400
 the motion of the planets can be more or less predicted.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.080
 You know, something about the weather

20:19.080 --> 20:20.640
 is much harder to predict.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.760
 Something about, you know, other kinds of things

20:22.760 --> 20:25.160
 that are much harder to predict.

20:25.160 --> 20:29.160
 And it's, these are, but science has tended to,

20:29.160 --> 20:31.040
 you know, concentrate itself on places

20:31.040 --> 20:35.080
 where its methods have allowed successful prediction.

20:35.080 --> 20:38.240
 So you think rule 30, if we could linger on it,

20:39.160 --> 20:41.600
 because it's just such a beautiful, simple formulation

20:41.600 --> 20:43.520
 of the essential concept underlying

20:43.520 --> 20:45.000
 all the things we're talking about.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.240
 Do you think there's pockets of reducibility

20:47.240 --> 20:48.480
 inside rule 30?

20:48.480 --> 20:51.600
 Yes, that is the question of how big are they?

20:51.600 --> 20:53.120
 What will they allow you to say?

20:53.120 --> 20:53.960
 And so on.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.960
 And that's, and figuring out where those pockets are,

20:56.960 --> 20:59.520
 I mean, in a sense, that's the, that's sort of a,

21:00.480 --> 21:02.640
 you know, that is an essential thing

21:02.640 --> 21:05.760
 that one would like to do in science.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.800
 But it's also, the important thing to realize

21:08.800 --> 21:13.760
 that has not been, you know, is that science,

21:13.760 --> 21:15.400
 if you just pick an arbitrary thing,

21:15.400 --> 21:18.120
 you say, what's the answer to this question?

21:18.120 --> 21:20.200
 That question may not be one

21:20.200 --> 21:22.880
 that has a computationally reducible answer.

21:22.880 --> 21:26.360
 That question, if you choose, you know,

21:26.360 --> 21:28.880
 if you walk along the series of questions

21:28.880 --> 21:30.280
 and you've got one that's reducible

21:30.280 --> 21:31.680
 and you get to another one that's nearby

21:31.680 --> 21:33.000
 and it's reducible too,

21:33.000 --> 21:36.080
 if you stick to that kind of stick to the land,

21:36.080 --> 21:39.640
 so to speak, then you can go down this chain

21:39.640 --> 21:41.960
 of sort of reducible, answerable things.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.440
 But if you just say, I'm just pick a question at random,

21:44.440 --> 21:47.400
 I'm gonna have my computer pick a question at random.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.280
 Most likely it's gonna be reducible.

21:49.280 --> 21:50.960
 Most likely it will be reducible.

21:50.960 --> 21:54.720
 And what we're thrown in the world, so to speak,

21:54.720 --> 21:56.440
 we, you know, when we engineer things,

21:56.440 --> 21:58.320
 we tend to engineer things to sort of keep

21:58.320 --> 22:00.280
 in the zone of reducibility.

22:00.280 --> 22:02.280
 When we're throwing things by the natural world,

22:02.280 --> 22:05.520
 for example, not at all certain

22:05.520 --> 22:08.680
 that we will be kept in this kind of zone of reducibility.

22:08.680 --> 22:11.240
 Can we talk about this pandemic then?

22:11.240 --> 22:12.080
 Sure.

22:12.080 --> 22:16.000
 For a second, is a, so how do we,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.920
 there's obviously huge amount of economic pain

22:18.920 --> 22:19.800
 that people are feeling.

22:19.800 --> 22:23.960
 There's a huge incentive and medical pain,

22:23.960 --> 22:26.760
 health, just all kind of psychological.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.760
 There's a huge incentive to figure this out,

22:28.760 --> 22:33.320
 to walk along the trajectory of reducible, of reducibility.

22:34.440 --> 22:38.040
 There's a lot of disparate data.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.520
 You know, people understand generally how viruses spread,

22:40.520 --> 22:43.240
 but it's very complicated

22:43.240 --> 22:45.320
 because there's a lot of uncertainty.

22:45.320 --> 22:49.320
 There's a, there could be a lot of variability also,

22:49.320 --> 22:52.920
 like so many, obviously a nearly infinite number

22:52.920 --> 22:57.920
 of variables that represent human interaction.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.920
 And so you have to figure out,

22:59.920 --> 23:02.680
 from the perspective of reducibility,

23:02.680 --> 23:06.600
 figure out which variables are really important

23:06.600 --> 23:10.600
 in this kind of, from an epidemiological perspective.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.800
 So why aren't we, you kind of said

23:13.800 --> 23:15.960
 that we're clearly failing.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.320
 Well, I think it's a complicated thing.

23:17.320 --> 23:20.200
 So, I mean, you know, when this pandemic started up,

23:20.200 --> 23:21.800
 you know, I happened to be in the middle

23:21.800 --> 23:24.800
 of being about to release this whole physics project thing,

23:24.800 --> 23:25.640
 but I thought, you know.

23:25.640 --> 23:28.280
 The timing is just cosmically absurd.

23:28.280 --> 23:30.440
 A little bit bizarre, but you know,

23:30.440 --> 23:31.360
 but I thought, you know,

23:31.360 --> 23:33.960
 I should do the public service thing of, you know,

23:33.960 --> 23:36.000
 trying to understand what I could about the pandemic.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.160
 And, you know, we'd been curating data about it

23:38.160 --> 23:39.280
 and all that kind of thing.

23:39.280 --> 23:41.680
 But, you know, so I started looking at the data

23:41.680 --> 23:43.600
 and started looking at modeling

23:43.600 --> 23:46.000
 and I decided it's just really hard.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.240
 You need to know a lot of stuff that we don't know

23:48.240 --> 23:49.840
 about human interactions.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.600
 It's actually clear now that there's a lot of stuff

23:51.600 --> 23:53.480
 we didn't know about viruses

23:53.480 --> 23:56.000
 and about the way immunity works and so on.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.840
 And it's, you know, I think what will come out in the end

23:58.840 --> 24:02.000
 is there's a certain amount of what happens

24:02.000 --> 24:04.320
 that we just kind of have to trace each step

24:04.320 --> 24:05.800
 and see what happens.

24:05.800 --> 24:06.960
 There's a certain amount of stuff

24:06.960 --> 24:08.280
 where there's going to be a big narrative

24:08.280 --> 24:12.240
 about this happened because, you know, of T cell immunity.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.320
 This could happen because there's this whole giant

24:14.320 --> 24:18.640
 sort of field of asymptomatic viral stuff out there.

24:18.640 --> 24:20.120
 You know, there will be a narrative

24:20.120 --> 24:22.400
 and that narrative, whenever there's a narrative,

24:22.400 --> 24:24.600
 that's kind of a sign of reducibility.

24:24.600 --> 24:26.000
 But when you just say,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.880
 let's from first principles figure out what's going on,

24:28.880 --> 24:30.880
 then you can potentially be stuck

24:30.880 --> 24:33.720
 in this kind of a mess of irreducibility

24:33.720 --> 24:35.680
 where you just have to simulate each step

24:35.680 --> 24:38.240
 and you can't do that unless you know details about,

24:38.240 --> 24:40.120
 you know, human interaction networks

24:40.120 --> 24:41.360
 and so on and so on and so on.

24:41.360 --> 24:46.360
 The thing that has been very sort of frustrating to see

24:46.440 --> 24:48.920
 is the mismatch between people's expectations

24:48.920 --> 24:50.760
 about what science can deliver

24:50.760 --> 24:53.680
 and what science can actually deliver, so to speak.

24:53.680 --> 24:56.760
 Because people have this idea that, you know, it's science.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.480
 So there must be a definite answer

24:58.480 --> 25:00.520
 and we must be able to know that answer.

25:00.520 --> 25:05.040
 And, you know, this is, it is both, you know,

25:05.040 --> 25:07.600
 when you've, after you've played around

25:07.600 --> 25:10.080
 with sort of little programs in the computational universe,

25:10.080 --> 25:11.840
 you don't have that intuition anymore.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.520
 You know, it's, I always, I'm always fond of saying,

25:14.520 --> 25:17.040
 you know, the computational animals

25:17.040 --> 25:18.240
 are always smarter than you are.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.240
 That is, you know, you look at one of these things

25:20.240 --> 25:23.240
 and it's like, it can't possibly do such and such a thing.

25:23.240 --> 25:25.280
 Then you run it and it's like, wait a minute,

25:25.280 --> 25:26.200
 it's doing that thing.

25:26.200 --> 25:27.520
 How does that work?

25:27.520 --> 25:29.320
 Okay, now I can go back and understand it.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.520
 But that's the brave thing about science

25:31.520 --> 25:35.880
 is that in the chaos of the irreducible universe,

25:35.880 --> 25:38.600
 we nevertheless persist to find those pockets.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.240
 That's kind of the whole point.

25:40.240 --> 25:43.000
 That's like, you say that the limits of science,

25:43.000 --> 25:46.800
 but that, you know, yes, it's highly limited,

25:46.800 --> 25:48.800
 but there's a hope there.

25:48.800 --> 25:51.960
 And like, there's so many questions I want to ask here.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.160
 So one, you said narrative, which is really interesting.

25:54.160 --> 25:58.040
 So obviously from a, at every level of society,

25:58.040 --> 26:00.400
 you look at Twitter, everybody's constructing narratives

26:00.400 --> 26:03.120
 about the pandemic, about not just the pandemic,

26:03.120 --> 26:06.000
 but all the cultural tension that we're going through.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
 So there's narratives,

26:07.000 --> 26:10.200
 but they're not necessarily connected

26:10.200 --> 26:15.200
 to the underlying reality of these systems.

26:17.400 --> 26:21.120
 So our human narratives, I don't even know if they're,

26:22.440 --> 26:25.360
 I don't like those pockets of reducibility

26:25.360 --> 26:29.480
 because we're, it's like constructing things

26:29.480 --> 26:31.800
 that are not actually representative of reality,

26:33.360 --> 26:36.360
 and thereby not giving us like good solutions

26:36.360 --> 26:39.520
 to how to predict the system.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.120
 Look, it gets complicated because, you know,

26:41.120 --> 26:43.840
 people want to say, explain the pandemic to me,

26:43.840 --> 26:45.320
 explain what's going to happen.

26:45.320 --> 26:46.360
 In the future.

26:46.360 --> 26:48.200
 Yes, but also, can you explain it?

26:48.200 --> 26:49.520
 Is there a story to tell?

26:49.520 --> 26:51.440
 What already happened in the past?

26:51.440 --> 26:53.040
 Yeah, or what's going to happen,

26:53.040 --> 26:55.280
 but I mean, you know, it's similar to sort of

26:55.280 --> 26:58.560
 explaining things in AI or in any computational system.

26:58.560 --> 27:00.960
 It's like, you know, explain what happened.

27:00.960 --> 27:03.000
 Well, it could just be this happened

27:03.000 --> 27:05.240
 because of this detail and this detail and this detail,

27:05.240 --> 27:06.880
 and a million details,

27:06.880 --> 27:08.600
 and there isn't a big story to tell.

27:08.600 --> 27:12.000
 There's no kind of big arc of the story that says,

27:12.000 --> 27:14.480
 oh, it's because, you know, there's a viral field

27:14.480 --> 27:15.640
 that has these properties

27:15.640 --> 27:17.680
 and people start showing symptoms.

27:17.680 --> 27:20.040
 You know, when the seasons change,

27:20.040 --> 27:21.000
 people will show symptoms

27:21.000 --> 27:22.480
 and people don't even understand, you know,

27:22.480 --> 27:24.640
 seasonal variation of flu, for example.

27:24.640 --> 27:28.480
 It's something where, you know,

27:28.480 --> 27:29.920
 there could be a big story,

27:29.920 --> 27:33.800
 or it could be just a zillion little details that mount up.

27:33.800 --> 27:38.200
 See, but, okay, let's pretend that this pandemic,

27:38.200 --> 27:41.080
 like the coronavirus, resembles something

27:41.080 --> 27:45.840
 like the 1D rule 30 cellular automata, okay?

27:45.840 --> 27:50.840
 So, I mean, that's how epidemiologists model virus spread.

27:51.880 --> 27:52.720
 Indeed, yes.

27:52.720 --> 27:54.320
 They sometimes use cellular automata, yes.

27:54.320 --> 27:57.280
 Yeah, and okay, so you could say it's simplistic,

27:57.280 --> 28:00.520
 but okay, let's say it's representative

28:00.520 --> 28:02.320
 of actually what happens.

28:02.320 --> 28:06.240
 You know, the dynamic of,

28:06.240 --> 28:07.480
 you have a graph,

28:07.480 --> 28:09.760
 it probably is closer to the hypergraph model.

28:09.760 --> 28:10.600
 It is, yes.

28:10.600 --> 28:13.280
 It's actually, that's another funny thing.

28:13.280 --> 28:15.320
 As we were getting ready to release this physics project,

28:15.320 --> 28:17.200
 we realized that a bunch of things we'd worked out

28:17.200 --> 28:20.680
 about foliations of causal graphs and things

28:20.680 --> 28:23.520
 were directly relevant to thinking about contact tracing.

28:23.520 --> 28:24.360
 Yeah, exactly.

28:24.360 --> 28:25.920
 And interactions with cell phones and so on,

28:25.920 --> 28:27.200
 which is really weird.

28:27.200 --> 28:29.680
 But like, it just feels like,

28:29.680 --> 28:31.000
 it feels like we should be able to get

28:31.000 --> 28:34.960
 some beautiful core insight about the spread

28:34.960 --> 28:36.720
 of this particular virus

28:36.720 --> 28:40.040
 on the hypergraph of human civilization, right?

28:40.040 --> 28:42.360
 I tried, I didn't manage to figure it out.

28:42.360 --> 28:43.520
 But you're one person.

28:43.520 --> 28:46.240
 Yeah, but I mean, I think actually it's a funny thing

28:46.240 --> 28:48.360
 because it turns out the main model,

28:48.360 --> 28:49.960
 you know, this SIR model,

28:49.960 --> 28:53.280
 I only realized recently was invented by the grandfather

28:53.280 --> 28:55.160
 of a good friend of mine from high school.

28:55.160 --> 28:58.800
 So that was just a, you know, it's a weird thing, right?

28:58.800 --> 29:02.240
 The question is, you know, okay, so you know,

29:02.240 --> 29:04.400
 on this graph of how humans are connected,

29:04.400 --> 29:05.880
 you know something about what happens

29:05.880 --> 29:07.520
 if this happens and that happens.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.680
 That graph is made in complicated ways

29:09.680 --> 29:11.480
 that depends on all sorts of issues

29:11.480 --> 29:13.120
 that where we don't have the data

29:13.120 --> 29:15.200
 about how human society works well enough

29:15.200 --> 29:17.160
 to be able to make that graph.

29:17.160 --> 29:20.480
 There's actually, one of my kids did a study

29:20.480 --> 29:23.320
 of sort of what happens on different kinds of graphs

29:23.320 --> 29:25.720
 and how robust are the results, okay?

29:25.720 --> 29:28.760
 His basic answer is there are a few general results

29:28.760 --> 29:30.720
 that you can get that are quite robust.

29:30.720 --> 29:33.080
 Like, you know, a small number of big gatherings

29:33.080 --> 29:36.280
 is worse than a large number of small gatherings, okay?

29:36.280 --> 29:37.680
 That's quite robust.

29:37.680 --> 29:40.120
 But when you ask more detailed questions,

29:40.120 --> 29:42.960
 it seemed like it just depends.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.200
 It depends on details.

29:44.200 --> 29:47.240
 In other words, it's kind of telling you in that case,

29:47.240 --> 29:49.760
 you know, the irreducibility matters, so to speak.

29:49.760 --> 29:53.040
 It's not, there's not gonna be this kind of one

29:53.040 --> 29:55.040
 sort of master theorem that says,

29:55.040 --> 29:57.520
 and therefore this is how things are gonna work.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.040
 Yeah, but there's a certain kind of,

29:59.040 --> 30:01.480
 from a graph perspective,

30:01.480 --> 30:04.720
 the certain kind of dynamic to human interaction.

30:04.720 --> 30:08.640
 So like large groups and small groups,

30:08.640 --> 30:10.520
 I think it matters who the groups are.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.600
 For example, you could imagine large,

30:12.600 --> 30:13.720
 depends how you define large,

30:13.720 --> 30:17.120
 but you can imagine groups of 30 people,

30:17.120 --> 30:22.120
 as long as they are cliques or whatever.

30:22.440 --> 30:23.280
 Right.

30:23.280 --> 30:27.640
 As long as the outgoing degree of that graph is small

30:27.640 --> 30:28.480
 or something like that,

30:28.480 --> 30:31.360
 like you can imagine some beautiful underlying rule

30:31.360 --> 30:34.640
 of human dynamic interaction where I can still be happy,

30:34.640 --> 30:36.520
 where I can have a conversation with you

30:36.520 --> 30:39.640
 and a bunch of other people that mean a lot to me in my life

30:39.640 --> 30:42.560
 and then stay away from the bigger, I don't know,

30:42.560 --> 30:45.600
 not going to a Miley Cyrus concert or something like that

30:45.600 --> 30:49.840
 and figuring out mathematically some nice.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.080
 See, this is an interesting thing.

30:51.080 --> 30:54.760
 So I mean, this is the question of what you're describing

30:54.760 --> 30:59.320
 is kind of the problem of the many situations

30:59.320 --> 31:00.600
 where you would like to get away

31:00.600 --> 31:02.040
 from computational irreducibility.

31:02.040 --> 31:05.080
 A classic one in physics is thermodynamics.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.840
 The second law of thermodynamics,

31:06.840 --> 31:09.880
 the law that says entropy tends to increase things

31:09.880 --> 31:13.240
 that start orderly tend to get more disordered,

31:13.240 --> 31:15.040
 or which is also the thing that says,

31:15.040 --> 31:16.640
 given that you have a bunch of heat,

31:16.640 --> 31:19.800
 it's hard, heat is the microscopic motion of molecules,

31:19.800 --> 31:23.600
 it's hard to turn that heat into systematic mechanical work.

31:23.600 --> 31:26.240
 It's hard to just take something being hot

31:26.240 --> 31:29.840
 and turn that into, oh, all the atoms are gonna line up

31:29.840 --> 31:31.520
 in the bar of metal and the piece of metal

31:31.520 --> 31:33.600
 is gonna shoot in some direction.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.800
 That's essentially the same problem

31:35.800 --> 31:40.040
 as how do you go from this computationally irreducible

31:40.040 --> 31:41.680
 mess of things happening

31:41.680 --> 31:43.560
 and get something you want out of it.

31:43.560 --> 31:45.760
 It's kind of mining, you're kind of,

31:45.760 --> 31:48.320
 now, actually I've understood in recent years

31:48.320 --> 31:50.880
 that the story of thermodynamics

31:50.880 --> 31:54.400
 is actually precisely a story of computational irreducibility,

31:54.400 --> 31:58.600
 but it is a, it is already an analogy.

31:58.600 --> 32:02.080
 You can kind of see that as can you take the,

32:02.080 --> 32:03.560
 what you're asking to do there

32:03.560 --> 32:07.840
 is you're asking to go from the kind of,

32:07.840 --> 32:10.080
 the mess of all these complicated human interactions

32:10.080 --> 32:12.360
 and all this kind of computational processes going on

32:12.360 --> 32:14.120
 and you say, I want to achieve

32:14.120 --> 32:15.240
 this particular thing out of it.

32:15.240 --> 32:18.680
 I want to kind of extract from the heat of what's happening.

32:18.680 --> 32:22.160
 I want to kind of extract this useful piece

32:22.160 --> 32:25.240
 of sort of mechanical work that I find helpful.

32:25.240 --> 32:26.080
 I mean.

32:26.080 --> 32:27.320
 Do you have a hope for the pandemic?

32:27.320 --> 32:28.600
 So we'll talk about physics,

32:28.600 --> 32:31.320
 but for the pandemic, can that be extracted?

32:31.320 --> 32:32.160
 Do you think?

32:32.160 --> 32:33.120
 What's your intuition?

32:33.120 --> 32:36.520
 The good news is the curves basically,

32:36.520 --> 32:38.480
 for reasons we don't understand,

32:38.480 --> 32:42.560
 the curves, the clearly measurable mortality curves

32:42.560 --> 32:46.360
 and so on for the Northern Hemisphere have gone down.

32:46.360 --> 32:50.320
 Yeah, but the bad news is that it could be a lot worse

32:50.320 --> 32:51.640
 for future viruses.

32:51.640 --> 32:55.200
 And what this pandemic revealed is we're highly unprepared

32:55.200 --> 32:59.840
 for the discovery of the pockets of reducibility

32:59.840 --> 33:02.560
 within a pandemic that's much more dangerous.

33:02.560 --> 33:07.400
 Well, my guess is the specific risk of viral pandemics,

33:07.400 --> 33:10.400
 you know, that the pure virology

33:10.400 --> 33:12.760
 and immunology of the thing,

33:12.760 --> 33:14.720
 this will cause that to advance to the point

33:14.720 --> 33:16.640
 where this particular risk

33:16.640 --> 33:19.040
 is probably considerably mitigated.

33:19.040 --> 33:24.040
 But is the structure of modern society robust

33:25.160 --> 33:26.920
 to all kinds of risks?

33:26.920 --> 33:29.160
 Well, the answer is clearly no.

33:29.160 --> 33:34.120
 And it's surprising to me the extent to which people,

33:34.120 --> 33:37.320
 as I say, it's kind of scary actually

33:37.320 --> 33:39.360
 how much people believe in science.

33:39.360 --> 33:41.560
 That is people say, oh, you know,

33:41.560 --> 33:43.160
 because the science says this, that and the other,

33:43.160 --> 33:44.320
 we'll do this and this and this,

33:44.320 --> 33:46.760
 even though from a sort of common sense point of view,

33:46.760 --> 33:50.440
 it's a little bit crazy and people are not prepared

33:50.440 --> 33:52.600
 and it doesn't really work in society

33:52.600 --> 33:53.600
 as it is for people to say,

33:53.600 --> 33:56.520
 well, actually we don't really know how the science works.

33:56.520 --> 33:58.600
 People say, well, tell us what to do.

33:58.600 --> 34:01.600
 Yeah, because then, yeah, what's the alternative?

34:01.600 --> 34:04.960
 For the masses, it's difficult to sit,

34:04.960 --> 34:08.560
 it's difficult to meditate on computational reducibility.

34:08.560 --> 34:10.280
 It's difficult to sit,

34:10.280 --> 34:13.120
 it's difficult to enjoy a good dinner meal

34:13.120 --> 34:15.600
 while knowing that you know nothing about the world.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.800
 Well, I think this is a place where, you know,

34:17.800 --> 34:21.160
 this is what politicians and political leaders do

34:21.160 --> 34:22.120
 for a living, so to speak,

34:22.120 --> 34:24.880
 is you've got to make some decision about what to do.

34:24.880 --> 34:25.840
 And it's...

34:25.840 --> 34:29.760
 Tell some narrative that while amidst the mystery

34:29.760 --> 34:33.760
 and knowing not much about the past or the future,

34:33.760 --> 34:37.240
 still telling a narrative that somehow gives people hope

34:37.240 --> 34:39.200
 that we know what the heck we're doing.

34:39.200 --> 34:41.520
 Yeah, and get society through the issue.

34:41.520 --> 34:43.440
 You know, even though, you know,

34:43.440 --> 34:45.560
 the idea that we're just gonna, you know,

34:45.560 --> 34:48.600
 sort of be able to get the definitive answer from science

34:48.600 --> 34:50.600
 and it's gonna tell us exactly what to do.

34:50.600 --> 34:54.360
 Unfortunately, you know, it's interesting

34:54.360 --> 34:56.880
 because let me point out that if that was possible,

34:56.880 --> 34:59.200
 if science could always tell us what to do,

34:59.200 --> 35:01.920
 then in a sense, our, you know,

35:01.920 --> 35:03.960
 that would be a big downer for our lives.

35:03.960 --> 35:05.080
 If science could always tell us

35:05.080 --> 35:06.760
 what the answer is gonna be,

35:06.760 --> 35:08.720
 it's like, well, you know,

35:08.720 --> 35:10.120
 it's kind of fun to live one's life

35:10.120 --> 35:11.720
 and just sort of see what happens.

35:11.720 --> 35:12.960
 If one could always just say,

35:12.960 --> 35:15.080
 let me check my science.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.760
 Oh, I know, you know,

35:16.760 --> 35:18.320
 the result of everything is gonna be 42.

35:18.320 --> 35:21.000
 I don't need to live my life and do what I do.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
 It's just, we already know the answer.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.840
 It's actually good news in a sense

35:24.840 --> 35:25.960
 that there is this phenomenon

35:25.960 --> 35:27.640
 of computational irreducibility

35:27.640 --> 35:30.760
 that doesn't allow you to just sort of jump through time

35:30.760 --> 35:33.680
 and say, this is the answer, so to speak.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.160
 And that's, so that's a good thing.

35:35.160 --> 35:38.120
 The bad thing is it doesn't allow you to jump through time

35:38.120 --> 35:39.640
 and know what the answer is.

35:39.640 --> 35:40.960
 It's scary.

35:40.960 --> 35:44.160
 Do you think we're gonna be okay as a human civilization?

35:44.160 --> 35:46.120
 You said, we don't know.

35:46.120 --> 35:46.960
 Absolutely.

35:47.920 --> 35:52.920
 Do you think we'll prosper or destroy ourselves?

35:53.920 --> 35:54.760
 In general?

35:54.760 --> 35:55.720
 In general.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.760
 I'm an optimist.

35:57.760 --> 35:59.200
 No, I think that, you know,

35:59.200 --> 36:01.000
 it'll be interesting to see, for example,

36:01.000 --> 36:02.480
 with this, you know, pandemic,

36:02.480 --> 36:05.720
 I, you know, to me, you know,

36:05.720 --> 36:08.320
 when you look at like organizations, for example,

36:08.320 --> 36:10.920
 you know, having some kind of perturbation,

36:10.920 --> 36:12.840
 some kick to the system,

36:12.840 --> 36:16.120
 usually the end result of that is actually quite good.

36:16.120 --> 36:17.720
 You know, unless it kills the system,

36:17.720 --> 36:19.520
 it's actually quite good usually.

36:19.520 --> 36:22.280
 And I think in this case, you know, people,

36:22.280 --> 36:23.840
 I mean, my impression, you know,

36:23.840 --> 36:25.400
 it's a little weird for me because, you know,

36:25.400 --> 36:28.000
 I've been a remote tech CEO for 30 years.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.720
 It doesn't, you know, this is bizarrely, you know,

36:30.720 --> 36:33.920
 and the fact that, you know, like this coming to see you here

36:33.920 --> 36:38.920
 is the first time in six months that I've been like,

36:39.160 --> 36:41.360
 you know, in a building other than my house, okay?

36:41.360 --> 36:46.160
 So, you know, I'm a kind of ridiculous outlier

36:46.160 --> 36:47.040
 in these kinds of things.

36:47.040 --> 36:50.920
 But overall, your sense is when you shake up the system

36:50.920 --> 36:55.200
 and throw in chaos that you challenge the system,

36:55.200 --> 36:57.720
 we humans emerge better.

36:57.720 --> 36:58.800
 Seems to be that way.

36:58.800 --> 36:59.640
 Who's to know?

36:59.640 --> 37:01.920
 I think that, you know, people, you know,

37:01.920 --> 37:05.040
 my sort of vague impression is that people are sort of,

37:05.040 --> 37:07.280
 you know, oh, what's actually important?

37:07.280 --> 37:10.400
 You know, what is worth caring about and so on?

37:10.400 --> 37:14.280
 And that seems to be something that perhaps is more,

37:14.280 --> 37:16.840
 you know, emergent in this kind of situation.

37:16.840 --> 37:19.840
 It's so fascinating that on the individual level,

37:19.840 --> 37:22.320
 we have our own complex cognition.

37:22.320 --> 37:24.080
 We have consciousness, we have intelligence,

37:24.080 --> 37:25.960
 we're trying to figure out little puzzles.

37:25.960 --> 37:28.280
 And then that somehow creates this graph

37:28.280 --> 37:30.280
 of collective intelligence.

37:30.280 --> 37:33.920
 Well, we figure out, and then you throw in these viruses

37:33.920 --> 37:36.600
 of which there's millions different, you know,

37:36.600 --> 37:39.360
 there's entire taxonomy and the viruses are thrown

37:39.360 --> 37:42.640
 into the system of collective human intelligence.

37:42.640 --> 37:45.680
 And when little humans figure out what to do about it,

37:45.680 --> 37:48.680
 we get like, we tweet stuff about information.

37:48.680 --> 37:50.720
 There's doctors as conspiracy theorists.

37:50.720 --> 37:53.120
 And then we play with different information.

37:53.120 --> 37:55.680
 I mean, the whole of it is fascinating.

37:55.680 --> 37:58.080
 I am like you also very optimistic,

37:58.080 --> 38:02.660
 but you said the computational reducibility.

38:04.120 --> 38:06.440
 There's always a fear of the darkness

38:06.440 --> 38:09.760
 of the uncertainty before us.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.120
 Yeah, I know. And it's scary.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.400
 I mean, the thing is, if you knew everything,

38:13.400 --> 38:14.320
 it will be boring.

38:15.280 --> 38:19.720
 And it would be, and then, and worse than boring,

38:19.720 --> 38:20.560
 so to speak.

38:20.560 --> 38:24.120
 It would reveal the pointlessness, so to speak.

38:24.120 --> 38:26.540
 And in a sense, the fact that there is

38:26.540 --> 38:28.000
 this computational irreducibility,

38:28.000 --> 38:30.360
 it's like as we live our lives, so to speak,

38:30.360 --> 38:31.660
 something is being achieved.

38:31.660 --> 38:34.360
 We're computing what our lives, you know,

38:35.520 --> 38:36.900
 what happens in our lives.

38:36.900 --> 38:37.740
 That's funny.

38:37.740 --> 38:40.520
 So the computational reducibility is kind of like,

38:40.520 --> 38:41.980
 it gives the meaning to life.

38:41.980 --> 38:43.360
 It is the meaning of life.

38:43.360 --> 38:45.720
 Computational reducibility is the meaning of life.

38:45.720 --> 38:46.560
 There you go.

38:46.560 --> 38:47.480
 It gives it meaning, yes.

38:47.480 --> 38:51.580
 I mean, it's what causes it to not be something

38:51.580 --> 38:53.540
 where you can just say, you know,

38:53.540 --> 38:55.760
 you went through all those steps to live your life,

38:55.760 --> 38:58.560
 but we already knew what the answer was.

38:58.560 --> 38:59.400
 Hold on one second.

38:59.400 --> 39:03.120
 I'm going to use my handy Wolfram Alpha sunburn

39:03.120 --> 39:06.120
 computation thing, so long as I can get network here.

39:06.120 --> 39:06.940
 There we go.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.460
 Oh, actually, you know what?

39:09.460 --> 39:11.460
 It says sunburn unlikely.

39:11.460 --> 39:12.680
 This is a QA moment.

39:12.680 --> 39:16.720
 This is a good moment.

39:16.720 --> 39:20.560
 Okay, well, let me just check what it thinks.

39:20.560 --> 39:22.000
 See why it thinks that.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.540
 It doesn't seem like my intuition.

39:23.540 --> 39:25.360
 This is one of these cases where we can,

39:25.360 --> 39:27.800
 the question is, do we trust the science

39:27.800 --> 39:30.360
 or do we use common sense?

39:30.360 --> 39:32.000
 The UV thing is cool.

39:32.000 --> 39:32.880
 Yeah, yeah, well, we'll see.

39:32.880 --> 39:35.040
 This is a QA moment, as I say.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.960
 It's, do we trust the product?

39:37.960 --> 39:39.560
 Yes, we trust the product, so.

39:39.560 --> 39:42.240
 And then there'll be a data point either way.

39:42.240 --> 39:43.560
 If I'm desperately sunburned,

39:43.560 --> 39:46.840
 I will send in an angry feedback.

39:46.840 --> 39:50.760
 Because we mentioned the concept so much

39:50.760 --> 39:51.960
 and a lot of people know it,

39:51.960 --> 39:54.480
 but can you say what computational reducibility is?

39:54.480 --> 39:55.320
 Yeah, right.

39:55.320 --> 39:58.760
 The question is, if you think about things

39:58.760 --> 40:01.160
 that happen as being computations,

40:01.160 --> 40:06.080
 you think about some process in physics,

40:06.080 --> 40:09.120
 something that you compute in mathematics, whatever else,

40:09.120 --> 40:11.920
 it's a computation in the sense it has definite rules.

40:11.920 --> 40:13.640
 You follow those rules.

40:13.640 --> 40:18.360
 You follow them many steps and you get some result.

40:18.360 --> 40:20.080
 So then the issue is,

40:20.080 --> 40:21.960
 if you look at all these different kinds of computations

40:21.960 --> 40:22.800
 that can happen,

40:22.800 --> 40:23.760
 whether they're computations

40:23.760 --> 40:24.880
 that are happening in the natural world,

40:24.880 --> 40:26.560
 whether they're happening in our brains,

40:26.560 --> 40:28.080
 whether they're happening in our mathematics,

40:28.080 --> 40:29.040
 whatever else,

40:29.040 --> 40:32.120
 the big question is, how do these computations compare?

40:32.120 --> 40:35.560
 Is, are there dumb computations and smart computations

40:35.560 --> 40:37.520
 or are they somehow all equivalent?

40:37.520 --> 40:41.720
 And the thing that I kind of was sort of surprised to realize

40:41.720 --> 40:43.960
 from a bunch of experiments that I did in the early nineties

40:43.960 --> 40:46.080
 and now we have tons more evidence for it,

40:46.080 --> 40:48.880
 this thing I call the principle of computational equivalence,

40:48.880 --> 40:51.920
 which basically says, when one of these computations,

40:51.920 --> 40:54.280
 one of these processes that follows rules,

40:54.280 --> 40:57.640
 doesn't seem like it's doing something obviously simple,

40:57.640 --> 41:00.120
 then it has reached the sort of equivalent level

41:00.120 --> 41:03.720
 of computational sophistication of everything.

41:03.720 --> 41:04.560
 So what does that mean?

41:04.560 --> 41:07.560
 That means that, you might say, gosh,

41:07.560 --> 41:11.600
 I'm studying this little tiny program on my computer.

41:11.600 --> 41:14.280
 I'm studying this little thing in nature,

41:14.280 --> 41:15.360
 but I have my brain

41:15.360 --> 41:18.440
 and my brain is surely much smarter than that thing.

41:18.440 --> 41:20.520
 I'm gonna be able to systematically outrun

41:20.520 --> 41:22.120
 the computation that it does

41:22.120 --> 41:24.000
 because I have a more sophisticated computation

41:24.000 --> 41:25.160
 that I can do.

41:25.160 --> 41:27.400
 But what the principle of computational equivalence says

41:27.400 --> 41:29.000
 is that doesn't work.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.800
 Our brains are doing computations

41:31.800 --> 41:34.600
 that are exactly equivalent to the kinds of computations

41:34.600 --> 41:36.920
 that are being done in all these other sorts of systems.

41:36.920 --> 41:38.320
 And so what consequences does that have?

41:38.320 --> 41:40.640
 Well, it means that we can't systematically

41:40.640 --> 41:42.240
 outrun these systems.

41:42.240 --> 41:45.840
 These systems are computationally irreducible

41:45.840 --> 41:47.800
 in the sense that there's no sort of shortcut

41:47.800 --> 41:50.440
 that we can make that jumps to the answer.

41:50.440 --> 41:51.880
 Now the general case.

41:51.880 --> 41:52.920
 Right, right.

41:52.920 --> 41:55.280
 But the, so what has happened,

41:55.280 --> 41:58.760
 what science has become used to doing

41:58.760 --> 42:00.720
 is using the little sort of pockets

42:00.720 --> 42:02.840
 of computational reducibility,

42:02.840 --> 42:04.800
 which by the way are an inevitable consequence

42:04.800 --> 42:06.680
 of computational irreducibility,

42:06.680 --> 42:08.640
 that there have to be these pockets

42:08.640 --> 42:11.480
 scattered around of computational reducibility

42:11.480 --> 42:14.440
 to be able to find those particular cases

42:14.440 --> 42:15.280
 where you can jump ahead.

42:15.280 --> 42:17.320
 I mean, one thing sort of a little bit

42:17.320 --> 42:20.440
 of a parable type thing that I think is fun to tell.

42:20.440 --> 42:22.440
 If you look at ancient Babylon,

42:22.440 --> 42:25.120
 they were trying to predict three kinds of things.

42:25.120 --> 42:27.960
 They tried to predict where the planets would be,

42:27.960 --> 42:29.440
 what the weather would be like,

42:29.440 --> 42:32.160
 and who would win or lose a certain battle.

42:32.160 --> 42:34.560
 And they had no idea which of these things

42:34.560 --> 42:36.480
 would be more predictable than the other.

42:36.480 --> 42:37.320
 That's funny.

42:37.320 --> 42:40.920
 And it turns out where the planets are

42:40.920 --> 42:43.600
 is a piece of computational reducibility

42:43.600 --> 42:46.680
 that 300 years ago or so we pretty much cracked.

42:46.680 --> 42:48.000
 I mean, it's been technically difficult

42:48.000 --> 42:49.040
 to get all the details right,

42:49.040 --> 42:52.160
 but it's basically, we got that.

42:52.160 --> 42:54.160
 Who's gonna win or lose the battle?

42:54.160 --> 42:55.400
 No, we didn't crack that one.

42:55.400 --> 42:57.600
 That one, that one, right.

42:57.600 --> 42:58.920
 Game theorists are trying.

42:58.920 --> 43:00.800
 Yes. And then the weather.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.480
 It's kind of halfway on that one.

43:02.480 --> 43:03.320
 Halfway?

43:03.320 --> 43:05.520
 Yeah, I think we're doing okay on that one.

43:05.520 --> 43:07.360
 Long term climate, different story.

43:07.360 --> 43:10.040
 But the weather, we're much closer on that.

43:10.040 --> 43:11.920
 But do you think eventually we'll figure out the weather?

43:11.920 --> 43:15.120
 So do you think eventually most think

43:15.120 --> 43:17.600
 we'll figure out the local pockets in everything,

43:17.600 --> 43:19.800
 essentially the local pockets of reducibility?

43:19.800 --> 43:22.720
 No, I think that it's an interesting question,

43:22.720 --> 43:25.560
 but I think that there is an infinite collection

43:25.560 --> 43:26.720
 of these local pockets.

43:26.720 --> 43:28.560
 We'll never run out of local pockets.

43:28.560 --> 43:30.600
 And by the way, those local pockets

43:30.600 --> 43:33.120
 are where we build engineering, for example.

43:33.120 --> 43:36.880
 That's how we, if we want to have a predictable life,

43:36.880 --> 43:40.520
 so to speak, then we have to build

43:40.520 --> 43:43.000
 in these sort of pockets of reducibility.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.520
 Otherwise, if we were sort of existing

43:46.520 --> 43:48.720
 in this kind of irreducible world,

43:48.720 --> 43:51.800
 we'd never be able to have definite things

43:51.800 --> 43:53.240
 to know what's gonna happen.

43:53.240 --> 43:55.400
 I have to say, I think one of the features,

43:55.400 --> 43:59.920
 when we look at sort of today from the future, so to speak,

43:59.920 --> 44:02.120
 I suspect one of the things where people will say

44:02.120 --> 44:04.440
 I can't believe they didn't see that

44:04.440 --> 44:07.000
 is stuff to do with the following kind of thing.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.160
 So if we describe, oh, I don't know,

44:10.160 --> 44:12.880
 something like heat, for instance,

44:12.880 --> 44:17.880
 we say, oh, the air in here, it's this temperature,

44:17.880 --> 44:20.320
 this pressure, that's as much as we can say.

44:20.320 --> 44:23.240
 Otherwise, just a bunch of random molecules bouncing around.

44:23.240 --> 44:26.080
 People will say, I just can't believe they didn't realize

44:26.080 --> 44:27.240
 that there was all this detail

44:27.240 --> 44:29.320
 and how all these molecules were bouncing around

44:29.320 --> 44:30.840
 and they could make use of that.

44:31.800 --> 44:32.920
 And actually, I realized there's a thing

44:32.920 --> 44:34.720
 I realized last week, actually,

44:34.720 --> 44:37.680
 was a thing that people say, one of the scenarios

44:37.680 --> 44:40.040
 for the very long term history of our universe

44:40.040 --> 44:42.560
 is a so called heat death of the universe,

44:42.560 --> 44:44.840
 where basically everything just becomes

44:44.840 --> 44:47.160
 thermodynamically boring.

44:47.160 --> 44:48.840
 Everything's just this big kind of gas

44:48.840 --> 44:50.080
 and thermal equilibrium.

44:50.080 --> 44:52.640
 People say, that's a really bad outcome.

44:52.640 --> 44:54.960
 But actually, it's not a really bad outcome.

44:54.960 --> 44:57.360
 It's an outcome where there's all this computation going on

44:57.360 --> 44:58.920
 and all those individual gas molecules

44:58.920 --> 45:01.440
 are all bouncing around in very complicated ways

45:01.440 --> 45:03.520
 doing this very elaborate computation.

45:03.520 --> 45:06.360
 It just happens to be a computation that right now,

45:06.360 --> 45:09.560
 we haven't found ways to understand.

45:09.560 --> 45:12.560
 We haven't found ways, our brains haven't,

45:12.560 --> 45:14.960
 and our mathematics and our science and so on,

45:14.960 --> 45:17.960
 haven't found ways to tell an interesting story about that.

45:17.960 --> 45:19.560
 It just looks boring to us.

45:19.560 --> 45:23.080
 So you're saying there's a hopeful view

45:23.080 --> 45:26.320
 of the heat death, quote unquote, of the universe

45:26.320 --> 45:30.400
 where there's actual beautiful complexity going on.

45:30.400 --> 45:34.440
 Similar to the kind of complexity we think of

45:34.440 --> 45:38.120
 that creates rich experience in human life and life on Earth.

45:38.120 --> 45:40.720
 So those little molecules interacting complex ways,

45:40.720 --> 45:43.320
 that could be intelligence in that, there could be.

45:43.320 --> 45:44.160
 Absolutely.

45:44.160 --> 45:46.120
 I mean, this is what you learn from this principle.

45:46.120 --> 45:48.000
 Wow, that's a hopeful message.

45:48.000 --> 45:48.840
 Right.

45:48.840 --> 45:49.680
 I mean, this is what you kind of learn

45:49.680 --> 45:51.720
 from this principle of computational equivalence.

45:51.720 --> 45:56.200
 You learn it's both a message of sort of hope

45:56.200 --> 45:59.040
 and a message of kind of, you know,

45:59.040 --> 46:01.120
 you're not as special as you think you are, so to speak.

46:01.120 --> 46:03.520
 I mean, because, you know, we imagine that

46:03.520 --> 46:06.360
 with sort of all the things we do with human intelligence

46:06.360 --> 46:07.640
 and all that kind of thing,

46:07.640 --> 46:09.880
 and all of the stuff we've constructed in science,

46:09.880 --> 46:12.000
 it's like, we're very special.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.200
 But actually it turns out, well, no, we're not.

46:15.200 --> 46:17.000
 We're just doing computations

46:17.000 --> 46:19.480
 like things in nature do computations,

46:19.480 --> 46:21.280
 like those gas molecules do computations,

46:21.280 --> 46:23.280
 like the weather does computations.

46:23.280 --> 46:26.120
 The only thing about the computations that we do

46:26.120 --> 46:30.000
 that's really special is that we understand

46:30.000 --> 46:31.160
 what they are, so to speak.

46:31.160 --> 46:33.120
 In other words, we have a, you know,

46:33.120 --> 46:35.320
 to us they're special because kind of,

46:35.320 --> 46:37.040
 they're connected to our purposes,

46:37.040 --> 46:39.160
 our ways of thinking about things and so on.

46:39.160 --> 46:41.000
 And that's some, but so.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.560
 That's very human centric.

46:42.560 --> 46:45.520
 That's, we're just attached to this kind of thing.

46:45.520 --> 46:48.280
 So let's talk a little bit of physics.

46:48.280 --> 46:50.960
 Maybe let's ask the biggest question.

46:50.960 --> 46:55.320
 What is a theory of everything in general?

46:55.320 --> 46:56.160
 What does that mean?

46:56.160 --> 46:58.000
 Yeah, so I mean, the question is,

46:58.000 --> 47:01.720
 can we kind of reduce what has been physics

47:01.720 --> 47:05.680
 as a something where we have to sort of pick away and say,

47:05.680 --> 47:08.280
 do we roughly know how the world works

47:08.280 --> 47:11.040
 to something where we have a complete formal theory

47:11.040 --> 47:14.240
 where we say, if we were to run this program

47:14.240 --> 47:17.680
 for long enough, we would reproduce everything,

47:17.680 --> 47:19.600
 you know, down to the fact that we're having

47:19.600 --> 47:21.160
 this conversation at this moment,

47:21.160 --> 47:22.800
 et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

47:22.800 --> 47:25.480
 Any physical phenomena, any phenomena in this world?

47:25.480 --> 47:27.040
 Any phenomenon in the universe.

47:27.040 --> 47:30.320
 But the, you know, because of computational irreducibility,

47:30.320 --> 47:33.720
 it's not, you know, that's not something where you say,

47:33.720 --> 47:36.160
 okay, you've got the fundamental theory of everything.

47:36.160 --> 47:39.920
 Then, you know, tell me whether, you know,

47:39.920 --> 47:42.480
 lions are gonna eat tigers or something.

47:42.480 --> 47:45.440
 You know, that's a, no, you have to run this thing

47:45.440 --> 47:48.560
 for, you know, 10 to the 500 steps or something

47:48.560 --> 47:50.800
 to know something like that, okay?

47:50.800 --> 47:54.200
 So at some moment, potentially, you say,

47:54.200 --> 47:57.560
 this is a rule and run this rule enough times

47:57.560 --> 47:59.760
 and you will get the whole universe, right?

47:59.760 --> 48:02.400
 That's what it means to kind of have

48:02.400 --> 48:04.720
 a fundamental theory of physics as far as I'm concerned

48:04.720 --> 48:06.600
 is you've got this rule.

48:06.600 --> 48:07.720
 It's potentially quite simple.

48:07.720 --> 48:09.360
 We don't know for sure it's simple,

48:09.360 --> 48:12.560
 but we have various reasons to believe it might be simple.

48:12.560 --> 48:15.800
 And then you say, okay, I'm showing you this rule.

48:15.800 --> 48:18.720
 You just run it only 10 to the 500 times

48:18.720 --> 48:20.080
 and you'll get everything.

48:20.080 --> 48:22.800
 In other words, you've kind of reduced the problem

48:22.800 --> 48:25.600
 of physics to a problem of mathematics, so to speak.

48:25.600 --> 48:27.760
 It's like, it's as if, you know, you'd like,

48:27.760 --> 48:29.760
 you generate the digits of pi.

48:29.760 --> 48:30.920
 There's a definite procedure.

48:30.920 --> 48:33.720
 You just generate them and it'd be the same thing

48:33.720 --> 48:35.600
 if you have a fundamental theory of physics

48:35.600 --> 48:38.640
 of the kind that I'm imagining, you know,

48:38.640 --> 48:42.760
 you get this rule and you just run it out

48:42.760 --> 48:45.880
 and you get everything that happens in the universe.

48:45.880 --> 48:50.880
 So a theory of everything is a mathematical framework

48:52.160 --> 48:55.360
 within which you can explain everything that happens

48:55.360 --> 48:58.640
 in the universe, it's kind of in a unified way.

48:58.640 --> 49:01.600
 It's not, there's a bunch of disparate modules of,

49:01.600 --> 49:06.600
 does it feel like if you create a rule

49:07.120 --> 49:11.200
 and we'll talk about the Wolfram physics model,

49:11.200 --> 49:16.200
 which is fascinating, but if you have a simple set

49:16.280 --> 49:20.880
 of rules with a data structure, like a hypergraph,

49:21.840 --> 49:25.120
 does that feel like a satisfying theory of everything?

49:25.120 --> 49:29.320
 Because then you really run up against the irreducibility,

49:29.320 --> 49:32.360
 computational irreducibility.

49:32.360 --> 49:34.240
 Right, so that's a really interesting question.

49:34.240 --> 49:38.200
 So I, you know, what I thought was gonna happen

49:38.200 --> 49:42.280
 is I thought we, you know, I thought we had a pretty good,

49:42.280 --> 49:45.480
 I had a pretty good idea for what the structure

49:45.480 --> 49:47.960
 of this sort of theory that sort of underneath space

49:47.960 --> 49:50.200
 and time and so on might be like.

49:50.200 --> 49:52.920
 And I thought, gosh, you know, in my lifetime,

49:52.920 --> 49:55.040
 so to speak, we might be able to figure out what happens

49:55.040 --> 49:58.160
 in the first 10 to the minus 100 seconds of the universe.

49:58.160 --> 50:01.480
 And that would be cool, but it's pretty far away

50:01.480 --> 50:03.840
 from anything that we can see today.

50:03.840 --> 50:05.760
 And it will be hard to test whether that's right

50:05.760 --> 50:07.520
 and so on and so on and so on.

50:07.520 --> 50:10.480
 To my huge surprise, although it should have been obvious

50:10.480 --> 50:12.600
 and it's embarrassing that it wasn't obvious to me,

50:12.600 --> 50:15.600
 but to my huge surprise,

50:15.600 --> 50:18.400
 we managed to get unbelievably much further than that.

50:18.400 --> 50:21.520
 And basically what happened is that it turns out

50:21.520 --> 50:23.160
 that even though there's this kind of bed

50:23.160 --> 50:25.280
 of computational irreducibility,

50:25.280 --> 50:30.040
 that sort of these, all these simple rules run into,

50:30.040 --> 50:34.240
 there are certain pieces of computational reducibility

50:34.240 --> 50:36.200
 that quite generically occur

50:36.200 --> 50:38.400
 for large classes of these rules.

50:38.400 --> 50:40.960
 And, and this is the really exciting thing

50:40.960 --> 50:42.400
 as far as I'm concerned,

50:42.400 --> 50:46.000
 the big pieces of computational reducibility

50:46.000 --> 50:49.320
 are basically the pillars of 20th century physics.

50:49.320 --> 50:50.280
 That's the amazing thing,

50:50.280 --> 50:52.680
 that general relativity and quantum field theory

50:52.680 --> 50:55.480
 is sort of the pillars of 20th century physics

50:55.480 --> 50:59.720
 turn out to be precisely the stuff you can say.

50:59.720 --> 51:00.840
 There's a lot you can't say,

51:00.840 --> 51:03.360
 there's a lot that's kind of at this irreducible level

51:03.360 --> 51:05.120
 where you kind of don't know what's going to happen,

51:05.120 --> 51:06.400
 you have to run it, you know,

51:06.400 --> 51:07.840
 you can't run it within our universe,

51:07.840 --> 51:10.240
 et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

51:10.240 --> 51:13.560
 But the thing is there are things you can say

51:13.560 --> 51:17.840
 and the things you can say turn out to be very beautifully

51:17.840 --> 51:19.760
 exactly the structure that was found

51:19.760 --> 51:21.520
 in 20th century physics,

51:21.520 --> 51:24.040
 namely general relativity and quantum mechanics.

51:24.040 --> 51:26.960
 And general relativity and quantum mechanics

51:26.960 --> 51:30.520
 are these pockets of reducibility that we think of as,

51:32.000 --> 51:34.120
 that 20th century physics

51:34.120 --> 51:36.880
 is essentially pockets of reducibility.

51:36.880 --> 51:39.400
 And then it is incredibly surprising

51:39.400 --> 51:43.440
 that any kind of model that's generative

51:43.440 --> 51:47.960
 from simple rules would have such pockets.

51:47.960 --> 51:49.920
 Yeah, well, I think what's surprising

51:49.920 --> 51:52.680
 is we didn't know where those things came from.

51:52.680 --> 51:53.920
 It's like general relativity,

51:53.920 --> 51:56.840
 it's a very nice mathematically elegant theory.

51:56.840 --> 51:58.400
 Why is it true?

51:58.400 --> 52:00.960
 You know, quantum mechanics, why is it true?

52:00.960 --> 52:04.160
 What we realized is that from this,

52:04.160 --> 52:07.080
 that these theories are generic

52:07.080 --> 52:09.280
 to a huge class of systems

52:09.280 --> 52:10.440
 that have these particular

52:10.440 --> 52:13.480
 very unstructured underlying rules.

52:13.480 --> 52:16.920
 And that's the thing that is sort of remarkable

52:16.920 --> 52:18.280
 and that's the thing to me

52:18.280 --> 52:20.320
 that's just, it's really beautiful.

52:20.320 --> 52:22.800
 I mean, it's, and the thing that's even more beautiful

52:22.800 --> 52:24.400
 is that it turns out that, you know,

52:24.400 --> 52:26.120
 people have been struggling for a long time.

52:26.120 --> 52:29.000
 You know, how does general relativity theory of gravity

52:29.000 --> 52:30.080
 relate to quantum mechanics?

52:30.080 --> 52:32.400
 They seem to have all kinds of incompatibilities.

52:32.400 --> 52:34.400
 It turns out what we realized is

52:34.400 --> 52:37.040
 at some level they are the same theory.

52:37.040 --> 52:40.840
 And that's just, it's just great as far as I'm concerned.

52:40.840 --> 52:43.160
 So maybe like taking a little step back

52:43.160 --> 52:47.120
 from your perspective, not from the low,

52:47.120 --> 52:50.680
 not from the beautiful hypergraph,

52:50.680 --> 52:52.480
 well, from physics model perspective,

52:52.480 --> 52:55.440
 but from the perspective of 20th century physics,

52:55.440 --> 52:57.240
 what is general relativity?

52:57.240 --> 52:58.320
 What is quantum mechanics?

52:58.320 --> 53:00.880
 How do you think about these two theories

53:00.880 --> 53:04.000
 from the context of the theory of everything?

53:04.000 --> 53:05.720
 Like just even definition.

53:05.720 --> 53:06.560
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

53:06.560 --> 53:08.800
 So I mean, you know, a little bit of history of physics,

53:08.800 --> 53:09.640
 right?

53:09.640 --> 53:12.040
 So, I mean the, you know, okay,

53:12.040 --> 53:14.200
 very, very quick history of this, right?

53:14.200 --> 53:16.240
 So, I mean, you know, physics, you know,

53:16.240 --> 53:19.000
 in ancient Greek times, people basically said,

53:19.000 --> 53:21.200
 we can just figure out how the world works.

53:21.200 --> 53:22.560
 As you know, we're philosophers,

53:22.560 --> 53:24.560
 we're gonna figure out how the world works.

53:24.560 --> 53:26.600
 You know, some philosophers thought there were atoms.

53:26.600 --> 53:28.600
 Some philosophers thought there were,

53:28.600 --> 53:30.600
 you know, continuous flows of things.

53:30.600 --> 53:33.000
 People had different ideas about how the world works.

53:33.000 --> 53:33.840
 And they tried to just say,

53:33.840 --> 53:36.840
 we're gonna construct this idea of how the world works.

53:36.840 --> 53:38.200
 They didn't really have sort of notions

53:38.200 --> 53:40.640
 of doing experiments and so on quite the same way

53:40.640 --> 53:41.480
 as developed later.

53:41.480 --> 53:43.320
 So that was sort of an early tradition

53:43.320 --> 53:46.600
 for thinking about sort of models of the world.

53:46.600 --> 53:51.200
 Then by the time of 1600s, time of Galileo and then Newton,

53:51.200 --> 53:55.280
 sort of the big idea there was, you know,

53:55.280 --> 53:57.640
 title of Newton's book, you know, Principia Mathematica,

53:57.640 --> 54:00.440
 mathematical principles of natural philosophy.

54:00.440 --> 54:04.240
 We can use mathematics to understand natural philosophy,

54:04.240 --> 54:07.080
 to understand things about the way the world works.

54:07.080 --> 54:10.480
 And so that then led to this kind of idea that, you know,

54:10.480 --> 54:12.760
 we can write down a mathematical equation

54:12.760 --> 54:14.960
 and have that represent how the world works.

54:14.960 --> 54:16.800
 So Newton's one of his most famous ones

54:16.800 --> 54:19.240
 is his universal law of gravity,

54:19.240 --> 54:21.160
 inverse square law of gravity

54:21.160 --> 54:23.360
 that allowed him to compute all sorts of features

54:23.360 --> 54:24.920
 of the planets and so on.

54:24.920 --> 54:26.240
 Although some of them he got wrong

54:26.240 --> 54:28.000
 and it took another hundred years

54:28.000 --> 54:30.200
 for people to actually be able to do the math

54:30.200 --> 54:31.240
 to the level that was needed.

54:31.240 --> 54:34.560
 But so that had been this sort of tradition

54:34.560 --> 54:36.280
 was we write down these mathematical equations.

54:36.280 --> 54:38.640
 We don't really know where these equations come from.

54:38.640 --> 54:39.960
 We write them down.

54:39.960 --> 54:42.480
 Then we figure out, we work out the consequences

54:42.480 --> 54:45.320
 and we say, yes, that agrees with what we actually observe

54:45.320 --> 54:47.320
 in astronomy or something like this.

54:47.320 --> 54:49.480
 So that tradition continued.

54:49.480 --> 54:51.440
 And then the first of these two

54:51.440 --> 54:55.480
 sort of great 20th century innovations was,

54:55.480 --> 54:57.320
 well, the history is actually a little bit more complicated,

54:57.320 --> 55:01.600
 but let's say that there were two,

55:01.600 --> 55:03.440
 quantum mechanics and general relativity.

55:03.440 --> 55:05.400
 Quantum mechanics kind of 1900

55:05.400 --> 55:08.400
 was kind of the very early stuff done by Planck

55:08.400 --> 55:12.320
 that led to the idea of photons, particles of light.

55:12.320 --> 55:14.880
 But let's take general relativity first.

55:14.880 --> 55:19.240
 One feature of the story is that special relativity

55:19.240 --> 55:21.800
 thing Einstein invented in 1905

55:21.800 --> 55:24.240
 was something which surprisingly

55:24.240 --> 55:27.040
 was a kind of logically invented theory.

55:27.040 --> 55:29.880
 It was not a theory where it was something where

55:29.880 --> 55:32.960
 given these ideas that were sort of axiomatically

55:32.960 --> 55:34.760
 thought to be true about the world,

55:34.760 --> 55:38.360
 it followed that such and such a thing would be the case.

55:38.360 --> 55:39.400
 It was a little bit different

55:39.400 --> 55:42.000
 from the kind of methodological structure

55:42.000 --> 55:45.920
 of some existing theories in the more recent times,

55:45.920 --> 55:47.640
 where it's just been, we write down an equation

55:47.640 --> 55:49.960
 and we find out that it works.

55:49.960 --> 55:51.560
 So what happened there.

55:51.560 --> 55:53.680
 So there's some reasoning about the light.

55:53.680 --> 55:57.720
 The basic idea was the speed of light

55:57.720 --> 55:59.960
 appears to be constant.

55:59.960 --> 56:01.920
 Even if you're traveling very fast,

56:01.920 --> 56:05.080
 you shine a flashlight, the light will come out.

56:05.080 --> 56:07.120
 Even if you're going at half the speed of light,

56:07.120 --> 56:08.920
 the light doesn't come out of your flashlight

56:08.920 --> 56:11.160
 at one and a half times the speed of light.

56:11.160 --> 56:13.080
 It's still just the speed of light.

56:13.080 --> 56:14.680
 And to make that work,

56:14.680 --> 56:18.040
 you have to change your view of how space and time work

56:18.040 --> 56:20.200
 to be able to account for the fact

56:20.200 --> 56:21.480
 that when you're going faster,

56:21.480 --> 56:24.440
 it appears that length is foreshortened

56:24.440 --> 56:26.240
 and time is dilated and things like this.

56:26.240 --> 56:27.200
 And that's special relativity.

56:27.200 --> 56:28.560
 That's special relativity.

56:28.560 --> 56:32.080
 So then Einstein went on with sort of

56:33.160 --> 56:34.800
 vaguely similar kinds of thinking.

56:34.800 --> 56:37.960
 In 1915, invented general relativity,

56:37.960 --> 56:39.920
 which is the theory of gravity.

56:39.920 --> 56:42.480
 And the basic point of general relativity

56:42.480 --> 56:44.840
 is it's a theory that says,

56:44.840 --> 56:49.680
 when there is mass in space, space is curved.

56:49.680 --> 56:51.040
 And what does that mean?

56:52.320 --> 56:55.160
 Usually you think of what's the shortest distance

56:55.160 --> 56:56.000
 between two points.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.920
 Like ordinarily on a plane in space, it's a straight line.

57:00.840 --> 57:04.640
 Photons, light goes in straight lines.

57:04.640 --> 57:06.440
 Well, then the question is,

57:06.440 --> 57:10.280
 is if you have a curved surface,

57:10.280 --> 57:12.160
 a straight line is no longer straight.

57:12.160 --> 57:13.560
 On the surface of the earth,

57:13.560 --> 57:16.200
 the shortest distance between two points is a great circle.

57:16.200 --> 57:17.040
 It's a circle.

57:18.600 --> 57:21.040
 So, you know, Einstein's observation was

57:21.040 --> 57:24.520
 maybe the physical structure of space

57:24.520 --> 57:26.800
 is such that space is curved.

57:26.800 --> 57:29.640
 So the shortest distance between two points,

57:29.640 --> 57:32.880
 the path, the straight line in quotes,

57:32.880 --> 57:34.160
 won't be straight anymore.

57:34.160 --> 57:37.160
 And in particular, if a photon is, you know,

57:37.160 --> 57:39.320
 traveling near the sun or something,

57:39.320 --> 57:40.600
 or if a particle is going,

57:40.600 --> 57:42.400
 something is traveling near the sun,

57:42.400 --> 57:45.320
 maybe the shortest path will be one

57:45.320 --> 57:48.840
 that is something which looks curved to us

57:48.840 --> 57:50.160
 because it seems curved to us

57:50.160 --> 57:53.240
 because space has been deformed by the presence of mass

57:53.240 --> 57:55.480
 associated with that massive object.

57:55.480 --> 57:59.240
 So the kind of the idea there is,

57:59.240 --> 58:01.000
 think of the structure of space

58:01.000 --> 58:03.680
 as being a dynamical changing kind of thing.

58:03.680 --> 58:04.840
 But then what Einstein did

58:04.840 --> 58:07.120
 was he wrote down these differential equations

58:07.120 --> 58:10.240
 that basically represented the curvature of space

58:10.240 --> 58:13.040
 and its response to the presence of mass and energy.

58:13.040 --> 58:18.040
 And that ultimately is connected to the force of gravity,

58:18.280 --> 58:20.600
 which is one of the forces that seems to,

58:20.600 --> 58:21.480
 based on its strength,

58:21.480 --> 58:24.800
 operate on a different scale than some of the other forces.

58:24.800 --> 58:27.760
 So it operates in a scale that's very large.

58:27.760 --> 58:32.160
 What happens there is just this curvature of space,

58:32.160 --> 58:35.960
 which causes, you know, the paths of objects to be deflected.

58:35.960 --> 58:37.200
 That's what gravity does.

58:37.200 --> 58:39.720
 It causes the paths of objects to be deflected.

58:39.720 --> 58:43.160
 And this is an explanation for gravity, so to speak.

58:43.160 --> 58:47.280
 And the surprise is that from 1915 until today,

58:47.280 --> 58:49.680
 everything that we've measured about gravity

58:49.680 --> 58:52.160
 precisely agrees with general relativity.

58:52.160 --> 58:55.720
 And that, you know, it wasn't clear black holes

58:55.720 --> 58:56.560
 were sort of a predict,

58:56.560 --> 58:57.720
 well, actually the expansion of the universe

58:57.720 --> 58:59.560
 was an early potential prediction,

58:59.560 --> 59:02.720
 although Einstein tried to sort of patch up his equations

59:02.720 --> 59:05.080
 to make it not cause the universe to expand,

59:05.080 --> 59:06.320
 because it was kind of so obvious

59:06.320 --> 59:08.160
 the universe wasn't expanding.

59:08.160 --> 59:10.480
 And, you know, it turns out it was expanding

59:10.480 --> 59:11.960
 and he should have just trusted the equations.

59:11.960 --> 59:14.480
 And that's a lesson for those of us

59:14.480 --> 59:16.680
 interested in making fundamental theories of physics

59:16.680 --> 59:19.840
 is you should trust your theory and not try and patch it

59:19.840 --> 59:22.000
 because of something that you think might be the case

59:22.000 --> 59:25.280
 that might turn out not to be the case.

59:25.280 --> 59:28.360
 Even if the theory says something crazy is happening.

59:28.360 --> 59:29.200
 Yeah, right.

59:29.200 --> 59:30.040
 Like the universe is expanding.

59:30.040 --> 59:31.880
 Like the universe is expanding, right, which is,

59:31.880 --> 59:35.160
 but, you know, then it took until the 1940s,

59:35.160 --> 59:36.840
 probably even really until the 1960s,

59:36.840 --> 59:38.600
 until people understood that black holes

59:38.600 --> 59:42.200
 were a consequence of general relativity and so on.

59:42.200 --> 59:45.640
 But that's, you know, the big surprise has been

59:45.640 --> 59:50.000
 that so far this theory of gravity has perfectly agreed

59:50.000 --> 59:51.880
 with, you know, these collisions of black holes

59:51.880 --> 59:54.480
 seen by their gravitational waves, you know,

59:54.480 --> 59:55.880
 it all just works.

59:55.880 --> 59:59.160
 So that's been kind of one pillar of the story of physics

59:59.160 --> 1:00:01.120
 it's mathematically complicated to work out

1:00:01.120 --> 1:00:03.080
 the consequences of general relativity,

1:00:03.080 --> 1:00:05.720
 but it's not, there's no, I mean,

1:00:05.720 --> 1:00:09.400
 and some things are kind of squiggly and complicated.

1:00:09.400 --> 1:00:12.120
 Like people believe, you know, energy is conserved.

1:00:12.120 --> 1:00:14.480
 Okay, well, energy conservation doesn't really work

1:00:14.480 --> 1:00:16.840
 in general activity in the same way as it ordinarily does.

1:00:16.840 --> 1:00:19.300
 And it's all a big mathematical story

1:00:19.300 --> 1:00:22.840
 of how you actually nail down something that is definitive

1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:25.320
 that you can talk about it and not specific to the,

1:00:25.320 --> 1:00:27.200
 you know, reference frames you're operating in

1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:28.420
 and so on and so on and so on.

1:00:28.420 --> 1:00:31.360
 But fundamentally, general relativity is a straight shot

1:00:31.360 --> 1:00:32.960
 in the sense that you have this theory,

1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:34.960
 you work out its consequences.

1:00:34.960 --> 1:00:39.300
 And that theory is useful in terms of basic science

1:00:39.300 --> 1:00:41.220
 and trying to understand the way black holes work,

1:00:41.220 --> 1:00:43.580
 the way the creation of galaxies work,

1:00:43.580 --> 1:00:45.840
 sort of all of these kinds of cosmological things,

1:00:45.840 --> 1:00:49.200
 understanding what happened, like you said, at the Big Bang.

1:00:49.200 --> 1:00:50.560
 Yeah. Like all those kinds of,

1:00:50.560 --> 1:00:52.800
 well, no, not at the Big Bang actually, right?

1:00:52.800 --> 1:00:53.860
 But the...

1:00:53.860 --> 1:00:55.880
 Well, features of the expansion of the universe, yes.

1:00:55.880 --> 1:00:58.220
 I mean, and there are lots of details

1:00:58.220 --> 1:00:59.920
 where we don't quite know how it's working, you know,

1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:02.040
 is there, you know, where's the dark matter,

1:01:02.040 --> 1:01:04.400
 is there dark energy, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:06.320
 But fundamentally, the, you know,

1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:08.440
 the testable features of general relativity,

1:01:08.440 --> 1:01:10.080
 it all works very beautifully.

1:01:10.080 --> 1:01:13.720
 And it's in a sense, it is mathematically sophisticated,

1:01:13.720 --> 1:01:17.160
 but it is not conceptually hard to understand in some sense.

1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:18.720
 Okay. So that's general relativity.

1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:21.240
 And what's its friendly neighbor, like you said,

1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:22.800
 there's two theories, quantum mechanics.

1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:24.320
 Right. So quantum mechanics,

1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:28.240
 the sort of the way that that originated was,

1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:31.360
 one question was, is the world continuous or is it discrete?

1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:32.480
 You know, in ancient Greek times,

1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:34.000
 people have been debating this.

1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:36.400
 People debated it, you know, throughout history.

1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:38.360
 Is light made of waves?

1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:39.820
 Is it continuous? Is it discrete?

1:01:39.820 --> 1:01:43.380
 Is it made of particles, corpuscles, whatever.

1:01:43.380 --> 1:01:47.760
 You know, what had become clear in the 1800s is that atoms,

1:01:47.760 --> 1:01:51.360
 that, you know, materials are made of discrete atoms.

1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:53.940
 You know, when you take some water,

1:01:53.940 --> 1:01:55.560
 the water is not a continuous fluid,

1:01:55.560 --> 1:01:57.360
 even though it seems like a continuous fluid

1:01:57.360 --> 1:01:58.880
 to us at our scale.

1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:00.760
 But if you say, let's look at it,

1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:02.480
 smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller scale,

1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:04.400
 eventually you get down to these, you know,

1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:06.320
 these molecules and then atoms.

1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:07.960
 It's made of discrete things.

1:02:07.960 --> 1:02:10.960
 The question is sort of how important is this discreteness?

1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:12.900
 Just what's discrete, what's not discrete?

1:02:12.900 --> 1:02:14.040
 Is energy discrete?

1:02:14.040 --> 1:02:17.400
 Is, you know, what's discrete, what's not?

1:02:17.400 --> 1:02:18.240
 And so.

1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:19.560
 Does it have mass?

1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:20.880
 Those kinds of questions.

1:02:20.880 --> 1:02:21.700
 Yeah, yeah, right.

1:02:21.700 --> 1:02:23.640
 Well, there's a question, I mean, for example,

1:02:23.640 --> 1:02:26.040
 is mass discrete is an interesting question,

1:02:26.040 --> 1:02:28.140
 which is now something we can address.

1:02:28.140 --> 1:02:33.140
 But, you know, what happened in the coming up to the 1920s,

1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:37.720
 there was this kind of mathematical theory developed

1:02:37.720 --> 1:02:40.500
 that could explain certain kinds of discreteness

1:02:40.500 --> 1:02:44.340
 in particularly in features of atoms and so on.

1:02:44.340 --> 1:02:47.780
 And, you know, what developed was this mathematical theory

1:02:47.780 --> 1:02:50.200
 that was the theory of quantum mechanics,

1:02:50.200 --> 1:02:52.520
 theory of wave functions, Schrodinger's equation,

1:02:52.520 --> 1:02:53.680
 things like this.

1:02:53.680 --> 1:02:57.320
 That's a mathematical theory that allows you to calculate

1:02:57.320 --> 1:02:59.260
 lots of features of the microscopic world,

1:02:59.260 --> 1:03:01.480
 lots of things about how atoms work,

1:03:01.480 --> 1:03:03.000
 et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.760
 Now, the calculations all work just great.

1:03:05.760 --> 1:03:09.400
 The question of what does it really mean

1:03:09.400 --> 1:03:11.300
 is a complicated question.

1:03:11.300 --> 1:03:14.280
 Now, I mean, to just explain a little bit historically,

1:03:14.280 --> 1:03:17.040
 the, you know, the early calculations of things like atoms

1:03:17.040 --> 1:03:20.320
 worked great in 1920s, 1930s and so on.

1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:21.400
 There was always a problem.

1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:24.200
 There were, in quantum field theory,

1:03:24.200 --> 1:03:27.300
 which is a theory of, in quantum mechanics,

1:03:27.300 --> 1:03:30.480
 you're dealing with a certain number of electrons

1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:31.940
 and you fix the number of electrons.

1:03:31.940 --> 1:03:34.900
 You say, I'm dealing with a two electron thing.

1:03:34.900 --> 1:03:35.800
 In quantum field theory,

1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:38.880
 you allow for particles being created and destroyed.

1:03:38.880 --> 1:03:41.200
 So you can emit a photon that didn't exist before.

1:03:41.200 --> 1:03:43.440
 You can absorb a photon, things like that.

1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:44.560
 That's a more complicated,

1:03:44.560 --> 1:03:46.280
 mathematically complicated theory.

1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:47.960
 And it had all kinds of mathematical issues

1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:49.980
 and all kinds of infinities that cropped up.

1:03:49.980 --> 1:03:51.400
 And it was finally figured out more or less

1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:52.920
 how to get rid of those.

1:03:52.920 --> 1:03:55.940
 But there were only certain ways of doing the calculations

1:03:55.940 --> 1:03:59.640
 and those didn't work for atomic nuclei among other things.

1:03:59.640 --> 1:04:03.840
 And that led to a lot of development up until the 1960s

1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:07.160
 of alternative ideas for how one could understand

1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:09.080
 what was happening in atomic nuclei, et cetera,

1:04:09.080 --> 1:04:10.120
 et cetera, et cetera.

1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:12.280
 End result, in the end,

1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:16.000
 the kind of most quotes obvious mathematical structure

1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.360
 of quantum field theory seems to work.

1:04:18.360 --> 1:04:20.680
 Although it's mathematically difficult to deal with,

1:04:20.680 --> 1:04:22.980
 but you can calculate all kinds of things.

1:04:22.980 --> 1:04:26.140
 You can calculate to a dozen decimal places,

1:04:26.140 --> 1:04:27.800
 certain things, you can measure them.

1:04:27.800 --> 1:04:28.640
 It all works.

1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:29.600
 It's all beautiful.

1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:30.440
 Now you say...

1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:32.520
 The underlying fabric is the model

1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:34.800
 of that particular theory is fields.

1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:37.000
 Like you keep saying fields.

1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:37.940
 Those are quantum fields.

1:04:37.940 --> 1:04:40.400
 Those are different from classical fields.

1:04:40.400 --> 1:04:43.400
 A field is something like you say,

1:04:44.640 --> 1:04:46.920
 like you say the temperature field in this room.

1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:49.520
 It's like there is a value of temperature

1:04:49.520 --> 1:04:51.360
 at every point around the room.

1:04:51.360 --> 1:04:53.980
 That's some, or you can say the wind field

1:04:53.980 --> 1:04:56.920
 would be the vector direction of the wind at every point.

1:04:56.920 --> 1:04:57.880
 It's continuous.

1:04:57.880 --> 1:05:00.200
 Yes, and that's a classical field.

1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:01.360
 The quantum field is a much more

1:05:01.360 --> 1:05:04.280
 mathematically elaborate kind of thing.

1:05:04.280 --> 1:05:06.400
 And I should explain that one of the pictures

1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:09.360
 of quantum mechanics that's really important is,

1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:11.760
 in classical physics, one believes

1:05:11.760 --> 1:05:13.800
 that sort of definite things happen in the world.

1:05:13.800 --> 1:05:16.160
 You pick up a ball, you throw it,

1:05:16.160 --> 1:05:17.980
 the ball goes in a definite trajectory

1:05:17.980 --> 1:05:20.200
 that has certain equations of motion.

1:05:20.200 --> 1:05:22.240
 It goes in a parabola, whatever else.

1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:25.320
 In quantum mechanics, the picture is

1:05:25.320 --> 1:05:26.880
 definite things don't happen.

1:05:26.880 --> 1:05:29.720
 Instead, sort of what happens is this whole

1:05:29.720 --> 1:05:34.720
 sort of structure of all many different paths being followed

1:05:34.840 --> 1:05:37.840
 and we can calculate certain aspects of what happens,

1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:40.560
 certain probabilities of different outcomes and so on.

1:05:40.560 --> 1:05:42.440
 And you say, well, what really happened?

1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:43.440
 What's really going on?

1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:45.680
 What's the sort of, what's the underlying,

1:05:45.680 --> 1:05:47.120
 what's the underlying story?

1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:50.640
 How do we turn this mathematical theory

1:05:50.640 --> 1:05:52.400
 that we can calculate things with

1:05:52.400 --> 1:05:54.760
 into something that we can really understand

1:05:54.760 --> 1:05:56.360
 and have a narrative about?

1:05:56.360 --> 1:05:58.920
 And that's been really, really hard for quantum mechanics.

1:05:58.920 --> 1:06:01.500
 My friend, Dick Feynman, always used to say,

1:06:01.500 --> 1:06:03.640
 nobody understands quantum mechanics,

1:06:03.640 --> 1:06:06.400
 even though he'd made his whole career

1:06:06.400 --> 1:06:10.160
 out of calculating things about quantum mechanics.

1:06:10.160 --> 1:06:11.720
 And so it's a little bit.

1:06:11.720 --> 1:06:16.720
 Nevertheless, it's what the quantum field theory is very,

1:06:16.840 --> 1:06:20.640
 very accurate at predicting a lot of the physical phenomena.

1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:21.720
 So it works.

1:06:21.720 --> 1:06:22.560
 Yeah.

1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:25.240
 But there are things about it, it has certain,

1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:27.780
 when we apply it, the standard model of particle physics,

1:06:27.780 --> 1:06:31.500
 for example, we, which we apply to calculate

1:06:31.500 --> 1:06:33.440
 all kinds of things that works really well.

1:06:33.440 --> 1:06:34.880
 And you say, well, it has certain parameters.

1:06:34.880 --> 1:06:36.900
 It has a whole bunch of parameters actually.

1:06:36.900 --> 1:06:41.540
 You say, why is the, why does the muon particle exist?

1:06:41.540 --> 1:06:44.880
 Why is it 206 times the mass of the electron?

1:06:44.880 --> 1:06:46.680
 We don't know, no idea.

1:06:46.680 --> 1:06:50.020
 But so the standard model of physics is one of the models

1:06:50.020 --> 1:06:51.720
 that's very accurate for describing

1:06:51.720 --> 1:06:55.200
 three of the fundamental forces of physics.

1:06:55.200 --> 1:06:58.240
 And it's looking at the world of the very small.

1:06:58.240 --> 1:06:59.080
 Right.

1:06:59.080 --> 1:07:03.140
 And then there's back to the neighbor of gravity,

1:07:03.140 --> 1:07:04.760
 of general relativity.

1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:07.660
 So, and then in the context of a theory of everything,

1:07:07.660 --> 1:07:12.660
 what's traditionally the task of the unification

1:07:13.560 --> 1:07:15.160
 of these theories?

1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:16.000
 And why is it hard?

1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:18.160
 The issue is you try to use the methods

1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:20.840
 of quantum field theory to talk about gravity

1:07:20.840 --> 1:07:22.000
 and it doesn't work.

1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000
 Just like there are photons of light.

1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:25.320
 So there are gravitons,

1:07:25.320 --> 1:07:27.960
 which are sort of the particles of gravity.

1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:30.280
 And when you try and compute sort of the properties

1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:32.680
 of the particles of gravity,

1:07:32.680 --> 1:07:36.040
 the kind of mathematical tricks that get used

1:07:36.040 --> 1:07:39.280
 in working things out in quantum field theory don't work.

1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:43.000
 And that's, so that's been a sort of fundamental issue.

1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:44.800
 And when you think about black holes,

1:07:44.800 --> 1:07:48.960
 which are a place where sort of the structure of space

1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:52.800
 is, you know, has sort of rapid variation

1:07:52.800 --> 1:07:55.320
 and you get kind of quantum effects mixed in

1:07:55.320 --> 1:07:57.520
 with effects from general relativity,

1:07:57.520 --> 1:07:58.720
 things get very complicated

1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:01.320
 and there are apparent paradoxes and things like that.

1:08:01.320 --> 1:08:02.840
 And people have, you know,

1:08:02.840 --> 1:08:05.040
 there've been a bunch of mathematical developments

1:08:05.040 --> 1:08:08.600
 in physics over the last, I don't know, 30 years or so,

1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:11.560
 which have kind of picked away at those kinds of issues

1:08:11.560 --> 1:08:14.000
 and got hints about how things might work.

1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:17.280
 But it hasn't been, you know,

1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:19.040
 and the other thing to realize is,

1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:20.680
 as far as physics is concerned,

1:08:20.680 --> 1:08:22.840
 it's just like here's general relativity,

1:08:22.840 --> 1:08:25.840
 here's quantum field theory, you know, be happy.

1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:28.760
 Yeah, so do you think there's a quantization of gravity,

1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:31.100
 so quantum gravity, what do you think of efforts

1:08:31.100 --> 1:08:33.760
 that people have tried to, yeah,

1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:36.340
 what do you think in general of the efforts

1:08:36.340 --> 1:08:39.600
 of the physics community to try to unify these laws?

1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:41.320
 So I think what's, it's interesting.

1:08:41.320 --> 1:08:43.360
 I mean, I would have said something very different

1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:46.400
 before what's happened with our physics project.

1:08:46.400 --> 1:08:48.880
 I mean, you know, the remarkable thing is

1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:51.720
 what we've been able to do is to make

1:08:51.720 --> 1:08:55.560
 from this very simple, structurally simple,

1:08:55.560 --> 1:08:57.960
 underlying set of ideas,

1:08:57.960 --> 1:09:00.940
 we've been able to build this, you know,

1:09:00.940 --> 1:09:04.480
 very elaborate structure that's both very abstract

1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:06.880
 and very sort of mathematically rich.

1:09:06.880 --> 1:09:09.240
 And the big surprise, as far as I'm concerned,

1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:12.960
 is that it touches many of the ideas that people have had.

1:09:12.960 --> 1:09:15.520
 So in other words, things like string theory and so on,

1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:18.160
 twister theory, it's like the, you know,

1:09:18.160 --> 1:09:21.020
 we might've thought, I had thought we're out on a prong,

1:09:21.020 --> 1:09:22.640
 we're building something that's computational,

1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:25.060
 it's completely different from what other people have done.

1:09:25.060 --> 1:09:27.320
 But actually it seems like what we've done

1:09:27.320 --> 1:09:30.820
 is to provide essentially the machine code that, you know,

1:09:30.820 --> 1:09:33.080
 these things are various features

1:09:33.080 --> 1:09:35.460
 of domain specific languages, so to speak,

1:09:35.460 --> 1:09:37.920
 that talk about various aspects of this machine code.

1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:41.800
 And I think this is something that to me is very exciting

1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:45.540
 because it allows one both for us to provide

1:09:45.540 --> 1:09:48.440
 sort of a new foundation for what's been thought about there

1:09:48.440 --> 1:09:52.000
 and for all the work that's been done in those areas

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:55.760
 to give us, you know, more momentum

1:09:55.760 --> 1:09:57.140
 to be able to figure out what's going on.

1:09:57.140 --> 1:09:58.840
 Now, you know, people have sort of hoped,

1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:01.200
 oh, we're just gonna be able to get, you know,

1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:03.400
 string theory to just answer everything.

1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:04.920
 That hasn't worked out.

1:10:04.920 --> 1:10:07.920
 And I think we now kind of can see a little bit about

1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:10.360
 just sort of how far away certain kinds of things are

1:10:10.360 --> 1:10:12.520
 from being able to explain things.

1:10:12.520 --> 1:10:14.720
 Some things, one of the big surprises to me,

1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:16.600
 actually I literally just got a message

1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:20.800
 about one aspect of this is the, you know,

1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:22.640
 it's turning out to be easier.

1:10:22.640 --> 1:10:24.880
 I mean, this project has been so much easier

1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:26.680
 than I could ever imagine it would be.

1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:29.720
 That is, I thought we would be, you know,

1:10:29.720 --> 1:10:31.360
 just about able to understand

1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:34.120
 the first 10 to the minus 100 seconds of the universe.

1:10:34.120 --> 1:10:35.800
 And, you know, it would be a hundred years

1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:37.640
 before we get much further than that.

1:10:37.640 --> 1:10:40.440
 It's just turned out, it actually wasn't that hard.

1:10:40.440 --> 1:10:42.480
 I mean, we're not finished, but, you know.

1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:45.840
 So you're seeing echoes of all the disparate theories

1:10:45.840 --> 1:10:47.400
 of physics in this framework.

1:10:47.400 --> 1:10:48.440
 Yes, yes.

1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:50.840
 I mean, it's a very interesting, you know,

1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:53.300
 sort of history of science like phenomenon.

1:10:53.300 --> 1:10:55.920
 I mean, the best analogy that I can see

1:10:55.920 --> 1:10:58.240
 is what happened with the early days

1:10:58.240 --> 1:11:00.600
 of computability and computation theory.

1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:03.520
 You know, Turing machines were invented in 1936.

1:11:03.520 --> 1:11:06.040
 People sort of understand computation

1:11:06.040 --> 1:11:07.280
 in terms of Turing machines,

1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:09.920
 but actually there had been preexisting theories

1:11:09.920 --> 1:11:12.920
 of computation, combinators, general recursive functions,

1:11:12.920 --> 1:11:14.880
 Lambda calculus, things like this.

1:11:14.880 --> 1:11:18.280
 But people hadn't, those hadn't been concrete enough

1:11:18.280 --> 1:11:20.320
 that people could really wrap their arms around them

1:11:20.320 --> 1:11:21.800
 and understand what was going on.

1:11:21.800 --> 1:11:23.480
 And I think what we're gonna see in this case

1:11:23.480 --> 1:11:26.000
 is that a bunch of these mathematical theories,

1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.080
 including some very,

1:11:28.080 --> 1:11:29.720
 I mean, one of the things that's really interesting

1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:31.840
 is one of the most abstract things

1:11:31.840 --> 1:11:36.240
 that's come out of sort of mathematics,

1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:39.680
 higher category theory, things about infinity group voids,

1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:41.640
 things like this, which to me always just seemed

1:11:41.640 --> 1:11:44.160
 like they were floating off into the stratosphere,

1:11:44.160 --> 1:11:48.300
 ionosphere of mathematics, turn out to be things

1:11:48.300 --> 1:11:52.000
 which our sort of theory anchors down

1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:56.240
 to something fairly definite and says are super relevant

1:11:56.240 --> 1:11:59.240
 to the way that we can understand how physics works.

1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:00.080
 Give me a sec.

1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:01.560
 By the way, I just threw a hat on.

1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:06.400
 You've said that with this metaphor analogy

1:12:06.400 --> 1:12:09.360
 that the theory of everything is a big mountain

1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:14.360
 and you have a sense that however far we are up the mountain,

1:12:14.360 --> 1:12:19.360
 that the Wolfram physics model view of the universe

1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:22.600
 is at least the right mountain.

1:12:22.600 --> 1:12:25.440
 We're the right mountain, yes, without question.

1:12:25.440 --> 1:12:27.880
 Which aspect of it is the right mountain?

1:12:27.880 --> 1:12:31.000
 So for example, I mean, so there's so many aspects

1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:34.560
 to just the way of the Wolfram physics project,

1:12:34.560 --> 1:12:39.560
 the way it approaches the world that's clean, crisp,

1:12:39.560 --> 1:12:44.560
 and unique and powerful, so there's a discreet nature to it,

1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:48.960
 there's a hypergraph, there's a computational nature,

1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:51.600
 there's a generative aspect, you start from nothing,

1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:56.600
 you generate everything, do you think the actual model

1:12:56.920 --> 1:12:58.320
 is actually a really good one,

1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:00.160
 or do you think this general principle

1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:02.880
 from simplicity generating complexity is the right,

1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:05.040
 like what aspect of the mountain is the correct?

1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:10.040
 Yeah, right, I think that the kind of the meta idea

1:13:10.080 --> 1:13:14.080
 about using simple computational systems to do things,

1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:18.080
 that's the ultimate big paradigm

1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:21.560
 that is sort of super important.

1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:25.560
 The details of the particular model are very nice and clean

1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:27.880
 and allow one to actually understand what's going on.

1:13:27.880 --> 1:13:30.600
 They are not unique, and in fact, we know that.

1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:34.680
 We know that there's a very, very, very, very,

1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:37.160
 there's a large number of different ways

1:13:37.160 --> 1:13:38.600
 to describe essentially the same thing.

1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:41.120
 I mean, I can describe things in terms of hypergraphs,

1:13:41.120 --> 1:13:43.520
 I can describe them in terms of higher category theory,

1:13:43.520 --> 1:13:45.240
 I can describe them in a bunch of different ways.

1:13:45.240 --> 1:13:47.480
 They are in some sense all the same thing,

1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:50.240
 but our sort of story about what's going on

1:13:50.240 --> 1:13:53.600
 and the kind of cultural mathematical resonances

1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:54.720
 are a bit different.

1:13:54.720 --> 1:13:57.600
 And I think it's perhaps worth sort of saying a little bit

1:13:57.600 --> 1:14:00.600
 about kind of the foundational ideas

1:14:00.600 --> 1:14:04.800
 of these models and things.

1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:09.800
 Great, so can you maybe, can we like rewind?

1:14:09.920 --> 1:14:11.120
 We've talked about it a little bit,

1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:14.080
 but can you say like what the central idea is

1:14:14.080 --> 1:14:16.680
 of the Wolfram Physics Project?

1:14:16.680 --> 1:14:19.200
 Right, so the question is we're interested

1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:21.920
 in finding sort of simple computational rule

1:14:21.920 --> 1:14:24.040
 that describes our whole universe.

1:14:24.040 --> 1:14:25.480
 Can we just pause on that?

1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:30.480
 It's just so beautiful, that's such a beautiful idea

1:14:30.920 --> 1:14:32.440
 that we can generate our universe

1:14:32.440 --> 1:14:37.440
 from a data structure, a simple structure,

1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:42.680
 simple set of rules, and we can generate our entire universe.

1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:44.840
 Yes, that's the idea. That's awe inspiring.

1:14:44.840 --> 1:14:49.840
 Right, but so the question is how do you actualize that?

1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:52.560
 What might this rule be like?

1:14:52.560 --> 1:14:55.160
 And so one thing you quickly realize is

1:14:55.160 --> 1:14:57.200
 if you're gonna pack everything about our universe

1:14:57.200 --> 1:15:01.240
 into this tiny rule, not much that we are familiar with

1:15:01.240 --> 1:15:04.000
 in our universe will be obvious in that rule.

1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.920
 So you don't get to fit all these parameters of the universe,

1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:10.080
 all these features of, you know, this is how space works,

1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:12.000
 this is how time works, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:13.080
 You don't get to fit that all in.

1:15:13.080 --> 1:15:16.680
 It all has to be sort of packed in to this thing,

1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:18.640
 something much smaller, much more basic,

1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:22.040
 much lower level machine code, so to speak, than that.

1:15:22.040 --> 1:15:23.520
 And all the stuff that we're familiar with

1:15:23.520 --> 1:15:26.240
 has to kind of emerge from the operation.

1:15:26.240 --> 1:15:27.840
 So the rule in itself,

1:15:27.840 --> 1:15:30.440
 because of the computational reducibility,

1:15:30.440 --> 1:15:32.320
 is not gonna tell you the story.

1:15:32.320 --> 1:15:35.680
 It's not gonna give you the answer to,

1:15:36.600 --> 1:15:38.360
 it's not gonna let you predict

1:15:38.360 --> 1:15:40.600
 what you're gonna have for lunch tomorrow,

1:15:40.600 --> 1:15:42.160
 and it's not going to let you predict

1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:44.800
 basically anything about your life, about the universe.

1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:47.880
 Right, and you're not going to be able to see in that rule,

1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:49.160
 oh, there's the three

1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:51.240
 for the number of dimensions of space and so on.

1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:52.080
 That's not gonna be there.

1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:54.560
 Spacetime is not going to be obviously.

1:15:54.560 --> 1:15:55.720
 Right, so the question is then,

1:15:55.720 --> 1:15:57.760
 what is the universe made of?

1:15:57.760 --> 1:16:00.200
 That's a basic question.

1:16:00.200 --> 1:16:01.640
 And we've had some assumptions

1:16:01.640 --> 1:16:02.960
 about what the universe is made of

1:16:02.960 --> 1:16:04.840
 for the last few thousand years

1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:08.680
 that I think in some cases just turn out not to be right.

1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:11.040
 And the most important assumption

1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:13.960
 is that space is a continuous thing.

1:16:13.960 --> 1:16:17.040
 That is that you can, if you say,

1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:19.200
 let's pick a point in space.

1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:20.120
 We're gonna do geometry.

1:16:20.120 --> 1:16:21.520
 We're gonna pick a point.

1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:24.320
 We can pick a point absolutely anywhere in space.

1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:28.080
 Precise numbers we can specify of where that point is.

1:16:28.080 --> 1:16:30.320
 In fact, Euclid who kind of wrote down

1:16:30.320 --> 1:16:32.960
 the original kind of axiomatization of geometry

1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:34.800
 back in 300 BC or so,

1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:38.320
 his very first definition, he says,

1:16:38.320 --> 1:16:40.640
 a point is that which has no part.

1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:45.640
 A point is this indivisible infinitesimal thing.

1:16:47.520 --> 1:16:50.440
 Okay, so we might've said that about material objects.

1:16:50.440 --> 1:16:52.880
 We might've said that about water, for example.

1:16:52.880 --> 1:16:54.800
 We might've said water is a continuous thing

1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:59.160
 that we can just pick any point we want in some water,

1:16:59.160 --> 1:17:00.760
 but actually we know it isn't true.

1:17:00.760 --> 1:17:04.120
 We know that water is made of molecules that are discrete.

1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:06.560
 And so the question, one fundamental question

1:17:06.560 --> 1:17:08.360
 is what is space made of?

1:17:08.360 --> 1:17:10.880
 And so one of the things that's sort of a starting point

1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:15.600
 for what I've done is to think of space as a discrete thing,

1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:18.560
 to think of there being sort of atoms of space

1:17:18.560 --> 1:17:20.600
 just as there are atoms of material things,

1:17:20.600 --> 1:17:23.120
 although very different kinds of atoms.

1:17:23.120 --> 1:17:25.000
 And by the way, I mean, this idea,

1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.200
 you know, there were ancient Greek philosophers

1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:28.360
 who had this idea.

1:17:28.360 --> 1:17:30.280
 There were, you know, Einstein actually thought

1:17:30.280 --> 1:17:31.840
 this is probably how things would work out.

1:17:31.840 --> 1:17:34.320
 I mean, he said, you know, repeatedly he thought

1:17:34.320 --> 1:17:35.520
 that's the way it would work out.

1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:38.680
 We don't have the mathematical tools in our time,

1:17:38.680 --> 1:17:42.520
 which was 1940s, 1950s and so on to explore this.

1:17:42.520 --> 1:17:44.120
 Like the way he thought,

1:17:44.120 --> 1:17:48.280
 you mean that there is something very, very small

1:17:48.280 --> 1:17:52.240
 and discrete that's underlying space.

1:17:52.240 --> 1:17:53.080
 Yes.

1:17:53.080 --> 1:17:56.600
 And that means that, so, you know, the mathematical theory,

1:17:56.600 --> 1:17:59.960
 mathematical theories in physics assume that space

1:17:59.960 --> 1:18:02.400
 can be described just as a continuous thing.

1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:04.000
 You can just pick coordinates

1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.000
 and the coordinates can have any values.

1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:07.840
 And that's how you define space.

1:18:07.840 --> 1:18:11.680
 Space is this just sort of background sort of theater

1:18:11.680 --> 1:18:13.600
 on which the universe operates.

1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:17.240
 But can we draw a distinction between space

1:18:17.240 --> 1:18:22.240
 as a thing that could be described by three values,

1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:25.400
 coordinates, and how you're,

1:18:25.400 --> 1:18:29.320
 are you using the word space more generally when you say?

1:18:29.320 --> 1:18:30.960
 No, I'm just talking about space

1:18:30.960 --> 1:18:34.320
 as in what we experience in the universe.

1:18:34.320 --> 1:18:38.440
 So that you think this 3D aspect of it is fundamental.

1:18:38.440 --> 1:18:40.840
 No, I don't think that 3D is fundamental at all, actually.

1:18:40.840 --> 1:18:45.160
 I think that the thing that has been assumed

1:18:45.160 --> 1:18:48.200
 is that space is this continuous thing

1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:49.480
 where you can just describe it by,

1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:51.320
 let's say three numbers, for instance.

1:18:51.320 --> 1:18:53.160
 But most important thing about that

1:18:53.160 --> 1:18:56.080
 is that you can describe it by precise numbers

1:18:56.080 --> 1:18:58.200
 because you can pick any point in space

1:18:58.200 --> 1:18:59.640
 and you can talk about motions,

1:18:59.640 --> 1:19:01.800
 any infinitesimal motion in space.

1:19:01.800 --> 1:19:03.320
 And that's what continuous means.

1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:04.240
 That's what continuous means.

1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:06.120
 That's what, you know, Newton invented calculus

1:19:06.120 --> 1:19:08.600
 to describe these kind of continuous small variations

1:19:08.600 --> 1:19:09.440
 and so on.

1:19:09.440 --> 1:19:11.400
 That was, that's kind of a fundamental idea

1:19:11.400 --> 1:19:15.360
 from Euclid on that's been a fundamental idea about space.

1:19:15.360 --> 1:19:16.200
 And so.

1:19:16.200 --> 1:19:17.520
 Is that right or wrong?

1:19:18.800 --> 1:19:20.000
 It's not right.

1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:20.960
 It's not right.

1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:25.720
 It's right at the level of our experience most of the time.

1:19:25.720 --> 1:19:27.760
 It's not right at the level of the machine code,

1:19:27.760 --> 1:19:28.920
 so to speak.

1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:29.760
 And so.

1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:31.040
 Machine code.

1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:32.200
 Yeah, of the simulation.

1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:33.040
 That's right.

1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:33.880
 That's right.

1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:36.960
 They're the very lowest level of the fabric of the universe,

1:19:36.960 --> 1:19:41.960
 at least under the Wolfram physics model

1:19:41.960 --> 1:19:44.240
 is your senses is discrete.

1:19:44.240 --> 1:19:45.080
 Right.

1:19:45.080 --> 1:19:46.320
 So now what does that mean?

1:19:46.320 --> 1:19:49.160
 So it means what is space then?

1:19:49.160 --> 1:19:54.160
 So in models, the basic idea is you say

1:19:54.160 --> 1:19:56.400
 there are these sort of atoms of space.

1:19:56.400 --> 1:19:59.080
 They're these points that represent,

1:19:59.080 --> 1:20:02.040
 you know, represent places in space,

1:20:02.040 --> 1:20:03.960
 but they're just discrete points.

1:20:03.960 --> 1:20:06.120
 And the only thing we know about them

1:20:06.120 --> 1:20:08.000
 is how they're connected to each other.

1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:09.480
 We don't know where they are.

1:20:09.480 --> 1:20:10.520
 They don't have coordinates.

1:20:10.520 --> 1:20:12.920
 We don't get to say this is a position, such and such.

1:20:12.920 --> 1:20:15.280
 It's just, here's a big bag of points.

1:20:15.280 --> 1:20:16.120
 Like in our universe,

1:20:16.120 --> 1:20:18.440
 there might be 10 to the 100 of these points.

1:20:18.440 --> 1:20:21.640
 And all we know is this point is connected

1:20:21.640 --> 1:20:22.480
 to this other point.

1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:23.480
 So it's like, you know,

1:20:23.480 --> 1:20:25.560
 all we have is the friend network, so to speak.

1:20:25.560 --> 1:20:27.960
 We don't have, you know, people's, you know,

1:20:27.960 --> 1:20:29.120
 physical addresses.

1:20:29.120 --> 1:20:31.560
 All we have is the friend network of these points.

1:20:31.560 --> 1:20:32.400
 Yeah.

1:20:32.400 --> 1:20:35.240
 The underlying nature of reality is kind of like a Facebook.

1:20:35.240 --> 1:20:37.240
 We don't know their location, but we have the friends.

1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:38.080
 Yeah, yeah, right.

1:20:38.080 --> 1:20:41.960
 We know which point is connected to which other points.

1:20:41.960 --> 1:20:43.480
 And that's all we know.

1:20:43.480 --> 1:20:44.320
 And so you might say, well,

1:20:44.320 --> 1:20:46.040
 how on earth can you get something

1:20:46.040 --> 1:20:49.200
 which is like our experience of, you know,

1:20:49.200 --> 1:20:50.560
 what seems like continuous space?

1:20:50.560 --> 1:20:51.640
 Well, the answer is,

1:20:51.640 --> 1:20:54.520
 by the time you have 10 to the 100 of these things,

1:20:54.520 --> 1:20:57.840
 those connections can work in such a way

1:20:57.840 --> 1:20:59.720
 that on a large scale,

1:20:59.720 --> 1:21:02.320
 it will seem to be like continuous space

1:21:02.320 --> 1:21:03.800
 in let's say three dimensions

1:21:03.800 --> 1:21:05.240
 or some other number of dimensions

1:21:05.240 --> 1:21:07.760
 or 2.6 dimensions or whatever else.

1:21:07.760 --> 1:21:10.360
 Because they're much, much, much, much larger.

1:21:10.360 --> 1:21:15.200
 So like the number of relationships here we're talking about

1:21:15.200 --> 1:21:16.480
 is just a humongous amount.

1:21:16.480 --> 1:21:18.880
 So the kind of thing you're talking about

1:21:18.880 --> 1:21:20.640
 is very, very, very small relative

1:21:20.640 --> 1:21:22.720
 to our experience of daily life.

1:21:22.720 --> 1:21:23.760
 Right, so I mean, you know,

1:21:23.760 --> 1:21:25.080
 we don't know exactly the size,

1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:30.080
 but maybe 10 to the minus,

1:21:30.400 --> 1:21:32.760
 maybe around 10 to the minus 100 meters.

1:21:32.760 --> 1:21:34.960
 So, you know, the size of, to give a comparison,

1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:38.480
 the size of a proton is 10 to the minus 15 meters.

1:21:38.480 --> 1:21:42.440
 And so this is something incredibly tiny compared to that.

1:21:42.440 --> 1:21:45.960
 And the idea that from that would emerge

1:21:45.960 --> 1:21:50.960
 the experience of continuous space is mind blowing.

1:21:51.040 --> 1:21:53.520
 Well, what's your intuition why that's possible?

1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:57.480
 Like, first of all, I mean, we'll get into it,

1:21:57.480 --> 1:21:59.320
 but I don't know if we will

1:21:59.320 --> 1:22:01.840
 through the medium of conversation,

1:22:01.840 --> 1:22:06.400
 but the construct of hypergraphs is just beautiful.

1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:07.240
 Right.

1:22:07.240 --> 1:22:08.200
 Cellular automata are beautiful.

1:22:08.200 --> 1:22:09.040
 We'll talk about it.

1:22:09.040 --> 1:22:11.120
 But this thing about, you know,

1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:14.160
 continuity arising from discrete systems

1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:17.240
 is in today's world is actually not so surprising.

1:22:17.240 --> 1:22:19.480
 I mean, you know, your average computer screen, right?

1:22:19.480 --> 1:22:21.920
 Every computer screen is made of discrete pixels.

1:22:21.920 --> 1:22:23.680
 Yet we have the, you know,

1:22:23.680 --> 1:22:25.440
 we have the idea that we're seeing

1:22:25.440 --> 1:22:27.000
 these continuous pictures.

1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:27.840
 I mean, it's, you know,

1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:29.480
 the fact that on a large scale,

1:22:29.480 --> 1:22:33.120
 continuity can arise from lots of discrete elements.

1:22:33.120 --> 1:22:35.640
 This is at some level unsurprising now.

1:22:35.640 --> 1:22:37.000
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:42.000
 But the pixels have a very definitive structure

1:22:42.360 --> 1:22:46.000
 of neighbors on a computer screen.

1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:46.840
 Right.

1:22:46.840 --> 1:22:50.520
 There's no concept of spatial,

1:22:50.520 --> 1:22:55.520
 of space inherent in the underlying fabric of reality.

1:22:55.760 --> 1:22:56.600
 Right, right, right.

1:22:56.600 --> 1:22:59.920
 So the point is that, but there are cases where there are.

1:22:59.920 --> 1:23:03.400
 So for example, let's just imagine you have a square grid.

1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:05.360
 Okay, and at every point on the grid,

1:23:05.360 --> 1:23:07.680
 you have one of these atoms of space

1:23:07.680 --> 1:23:09.480
 and it's connected to four other,

1:23:09.480 --> 1:23:11.440
 four other atoms of space on the, you know,

1:23:11.440 --> 1:23:13.640
 Northeast, Southwest corners, right?

1:23:14.480 --> 1:23:17.600
 There you have something where if you zoom out from that,

1:23:17.600 --> 1:23:19.040
 it's like a computer screen.

1:23:19.040 --> 1:23:23.240
 Yeah, so the relationship creates the spatial,

1:23:23.240 --> 1:23:26.720
 like the relationship creates a constraint,

1:23:26.720 --> 1:23:31.720
 which then in an emergent sense creates a like,

1:23:33.080 --> 1:23:37.720
 yeah, like basically a spatial coordinate for that thing.

1:23:37.720 --> 1:23:38.560
 Yeah, right.

1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:40.560
 Even though the individual point doesn't have a space.

1:23:40.560 --> 1:23:42.320
 Even though the individual point doesn't know anything,

1:23:42.320 --> 1:23:45.000
 it just knows what its neighbors are.

1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:48.840
 On a large scale, it can be described by saying,

1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:50.960
 oh, it looks like it's a, you know,

1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:52.800
 this grid is zoomed out grid.

1:23:52.800 --> 1:23:54.920
 You can say, well, you can describe these different points

1:23:54.920 --> 1:23:56.480
 by saying they have certain positions,

1:23:56.480 --> 1:23:57.840
 coordinates, et cetera.

1:23:57.840 --> 1:23:59.920
 Now, in the sort of real setup,

1:23:59.920 --> 1:24:00.920
 it's more complicated than that.

1:24:00.920 --> 1:24:03.040
 It isn't just a square grid or something.

1:24:03.040 --> 1:24:05.720
 It's something much more dynamic and complicated,

1:24:05.720 --> 1:24:07.200
 which we'll talk about.

1:24:07.200 --> 1:24:10.800
 But so, you know, the first idea,

1:24:10.800 --> 1:24:12.720
 the first key idea is, you know,

1:24:12.720 --> 1:24:13.840
 what's the universe made of?

1:24:13.840 --> 1:24:15.720
 It's made of atoms of space basically

1:24:15.720 --> 1:24:17.760
 with these connections between them.

1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:19.320
 What kind of connections do they have?

1:24:19.320 --> 1:24:23.000
 Well, so the simplest kind of thing you might say is,

1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:25.200
 we've got something like a graph

1:24:25.200 --> 1:24:28.440
 where every atom of space,

1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:31.200
 where we have these edges that go between,

1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:33.120
 these connections that go between atoms of space.

1:24:33.120 --> 1:24:34.960
 We're not saying how long these edges are.

1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:36.360
 We're just saying there is a connection

1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:39.080
 from this place, from this atom to this atom.

1:24:39.080 --> 1:24:40.600
 Just a quick pause,

1:24:40.600 --> 1:24:44.520
 because there's a lot of very people that listen to this.

1:24:44.520 --> 1:24:46.920
 Just to clarify, because I did a poll actually,

1:24:46.920 --> 1:24:49.640
 what do you think a graph is a long time ago?

1:24:49.640 --> 1:24:52.080
 And it's kind of funny how few people

1:24:52.080 --> 1:24:55.920
 know the term graph outside of computer science.

1:24:55.920 --> 1:24:56.760
 It's good.

1:24:56.760 --> 1:24:57.600
 Let's call it a network.

1:24:57.600 --> 1:24:58.440
 I think that's it.

1:24:58.440 --> 1:24:59.280
 Let's call it a network is better.

1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:00.920
 So, but every time, I like the word graph though.

1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:03.880
 So let's define, let's just say that a graph

1:25:03.880 --> 1:25:06.680
 will use terms nodes and edges maybe.

1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:11.600
 And it's just the nodes represent some abstract entity

1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:13.960
 and then the edges represent relationships

1:25:13.960 --> 1:25:14.840
 between those entities.

1:25:14.840 --> 1:25:15.880
 Right, exactly.

1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:16.800
 So that's what a graph says.

1:25:16.800 --> 1:25:18.480
 Sorry, so there you go.

1:25:18.480 --> 1:25:20.600
 So that's the basic structure.

1:25:20.600 --> 1:25:23.360
 That is the simplest case of a basic structure.

1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:27.840
 Actually, it tends to be better to think about hypergraphs.

1:25:27.840 --> 1:25:31.560
 So a hypergraph is just, instead of saying

1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:34.600
 there are connections between pairs of things,

1:25:34.600 --> 1:25:37.160
 we say there are connections between any number of things.

1:25:37.160 --> 1:25:39.200
 So there might be ternary edges.

1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:42.920
 So instead of just having two points

1:25:42.920 --> 1:25:44.520
 are connected by an edge,

1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:48.320
 you say three points are all associated with a hyperedge,

1:25:48.320 --> 1:25:50.200
 are all connected by a hyperedge.

1:25:50.200 --> 1:25:54.120
 That's just, at some level, that's a detail.

1:25:54.120 --> 1:25:57.880
 It's a detail that happens to make the, for me,

1:25:57.880 --> 1:26:00.000
 sort of in the history of this project,

1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.320
 the realization that you could do things that way

1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:04.360
 broke out of certain kinds of arbitrariness

1:26:04.360 --> 1:26:06.080
 that I felt that there was in the model

1:26:06.080 --> 1:26:07.880
 before I had seen how this worked.

1:26:07.880 --> 1:26:12.440
 I mean, a hypergraph can be mapped to a graph.

1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:14.360
 It's just a convenient representation.

1:26:14.360 --> 1:26:15.320
 Mathematical speaking.

1:26:15.320 --> 1:26:16.920
 That's correct. That's correct.

1:26:16.920 --> 1:26:19.680
 But so then, so, okay, so the first question,

1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:22.720
 the first idea of these models of ours is

1:26:22.720 --> 1:26:26.520
 space is made of these connected sort of atoms of space.

1:26:26.520 --> 1:26:29.800
 The next idea is space is all there is.

1:26:29.800 --> 1:26:31.840
 There's nothing except for this space.

1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:33.880
 So in traditional ideas in physics,

1:26:33.880 --> 1:26:36.960
 people have said there's space, it's kind of a background.

1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:39.200
 And then there's matter, all these particles, electrons,

1:26:39.200 --> 1:26:43.360
 all these other things, which exist in space, right?

1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:46.200
 But in this model, one of the key ideas is

1:26:46.200 --> 1:26:48.400
 there's nothing except space.

1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:52.160
 So in other words, everything that exists in the universe

1:26:52.160 --> 1:26:54.640
 is a feature of this hypergraph.

1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:55.920
 So how can that possibly be?

1:26:55.920 --> 1:26:58.040
 Well, the way that works is

1:26:58.040 --> 1:27:01.640
 that there are certain structures in this hypergraph

1:27:01.640 --> 1:27:05.760
 where you say that little twisty knotted thing,

1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:07.240
 we don't know exactly how this works yet,

1:27:07.240 --> 1:27:10.960
 but we have sort of idea about how it works mathematically.

1:27:10.960 --> 1:27:13.000
 This sort of twisted knotted thing,

1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:14.840
 that's the core of an electron.

1:27:14.840 --> 1:27:17.360
 This thing over there that has this different form,

1:27:17.360 --> 1:27:18.520
 that's something else.

1:27:18.520 --> 1:27:21.040
 So the different peculiarities of the structure

1:27:21.040 --> 1:27:24.800
 of this graph are the very things

1:27:24.800 --> 1:27:29.000
 that we think of as the particles inside the space,

1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:31.760
 but in fact, it's just a property of the space.

1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:34.960
 Mind blowing, first of all, that it's mind blowing,

1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:38.520
 and we'll probably talk in its simplicity and beauty.

1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:40.480
 Yes, I think it's very beautiful.

1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:41.320
 I mean, this is, I'm...

1:27:41.320 --> 1:27:43.080
 But okay, but that's space,

1:27:43.080 --> 1:27:44.560
 and then there's another concept

1:27:44.560 --> 1:27:45.880
 we didn't really kind of mention,

1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:50.480
 but you think it of computation as a transformation.

1:27:50.480 --> 1:27:51.680
 Let's talk about time in a second.

1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:55.360
 Let's just, I mean, on the subject of space,

1:27:55.360 --> 1:27:57.680
 there's this question of kind of what,

1:27:57.680 --> 1:27:59.880
 there's this idea, there is this hypergraph,

1:27:59.880 --> 1:28:01.760
 it represents space,

1:28:01.760 --> 1:28:03.640
 and it represents everything that's in space.

1:28:03.640 --> 1:28:05.320
 The features of that hypergraph,

1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:08.320
 you can say certain features in this part we do know,

1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:09.680
 certain features of the hypergraph

1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:11.800
 represent the presence of energy, for example,

1:28:11.800 --> 1:28:13.960
 or the presence of mass or momentum,

1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:16.080
 and we know what the features of the hypergraph

1:28:16.080 --> 1:28:17.920
 that represent those things are,

1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:20.320
 but it's all just the same hypergraph.

1:28:20.320 --> 1:28:22.040
 So one thing you might ask is,

1:28:22.040 --> 1:28:24.280
 you know, if you just look at this hypergraph and you say,

1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:27.160
 and we're gonna talk about sort of what the hypergraph does,

1:28:27.160 --> 1:28:28.600
 but if you say, you know,

1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:31.320
 how much of what's going on in this hypergraph

1:28:31.320 --> 1:28:34.040
 is things we know and care about,

1:28:34.040 --> 1:28:36.520
 like particles and atoms and electrons

1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:37.560
 and all this kind of thing,

1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:40.880
 and how much is just the background of space?

1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:45.440
 So it turns out, so far as in one rough estimate of this,

1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:47.880
 everything that we care about in the universe

1:28:47.880 --> 1:28:50.800
 is only one part in 10 to the 120

1:28:50.800 --> 1:28:52.040
 of what's actually going on.

1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:54.040
 The vast majority of what's happening

1:28:54.040 --> 1:28:57.360
 is purely things that maintain the structure of space.

1:28:57.360 --> 1:28:59.760
 That, in other words, that the things that are

1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:03.280
 the features of space that are the things

1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:04.640
 that we consider notable,

1:29:04.640 --> 1:29:06.480
 like the presence of particles and so on,

1:29:06.480 --> 1:29:08.760
 that's a tiny little piece of froth

1:29:08.760 --> 1:29:10.680
 on the top of all this activity

1:29:10.680 --> 1:29:13.560
 that mostly is just intended to,

1:29:13.560 --> 1:29:15.160
 you know, mostly, I can't say intended,

1:29:15.160 --> 1:29:16.480
 there's no intention here,

1:29:16.480 --> 1:29:19.000
 that just maintains the structure of space.

1:29:20.600 --> 1:29:21.960
 Let me load that in.

1:29:24.160 --> 1:29:26.720
 It just makes me feel so good as a human being.

1:29:27.880 --> 1:29:31.800
 To be the froth on the one in a 10 to the 120

1:29:31.800 --> 1:29:33.120
 or something of, well.

1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:37.960
 And also just humbling how,

1:29:37.960 --> 1:29:39.880
 in this mathematical framework,

1:29:39.880 --> 1:29:41.400
 how much work needs to be done

1:29:41.400 --> 1:29:44.840
 on the infrastructure of our universe.

1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:46.840
 Right, to maintain the infrastructure of our universe

1:29:46.840 --> 1:29:47.960
 is a lot of work.

1:29:47.960 --> 1:29:51.560
 We are merely writing a little tiny things

1:29:51.560 --> 1:29:53.360
 on top of that infrastructure.

1:29:53.360 --> 1:29:57.480
 But you were just starting to talk a little bit about,

1:29:57.480 --> 1:29:59.800
 we talked about space,

1:29:59.800 --> 1:30:03.280
 that represents all the stuff that's in the universe.

1:30:03.280 --> 1:30:06.080
 The question is, what does that stuff do?

1:30:06.080 --> 1:30:09.200
 And for that, we have to start talking about time

1:30:09.200 --> 1:30:11.440
 and what is time and so on.

1:30:11.440 --> 1:30:15.240
 And, you know, one of the basic idea of this model

1:30:15.240 --> 1:30:18.000
 is time is the progression of computation.

1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:21.040
 So in other words, we have a structure of space

1:30:21.040 --> 1:30:23.000
 and there is a rule that says

1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:25.120
 how that structure of space will change.

1:30:25.120 --> 1:30:26.160
 And it's the application,

1:30:26.160 --> 1:30:28.480
 the repeated application of that rule

1:30:28.480 --> 1:30:31.320
 that defines the progress of time.

1:30:32.400 --> 1:30:34.040
 And what does the rule look like

1:30:34.040 --> 1:30:36.000
 in the space of hypergraphs?

1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:38.640
 Right, so what the rule says is something like,

1:30:38.640 --> 1:30:40.440
 if you have a little tiny piece of hypergraph

1:30:40.440 --> 1:30:42.200
 that looks like this,

1:30:42.200 --> 1:30:44.720
 then it will be transformed into a piece of hypergraph

1:30:44.720 --> 1:30:46.640
 that looks like this.

1:30:46.640 --> 1:30:47.880
 So that's all it says.

1:30:47.880 --> 1:30:51.280
 It says you pick up these elements of space

1:30:51.280 --> 1:30:54.360
 and you can think of these edges,

1:30:54.360 --> 1:30:56.040
 these hyper edges as being relations

1:30:56.040 --> 1:30:57.720
 between elements in space.

1:30:57.720 --> 1:31:01.200
 You might pick up these two relations

1:31:01.200 --> 1:31:03.280
 between elements in space.

1:31:03.280 --> 1:31:04.840
 And we're not saying where those elements are

1:31:04.840 --> 1:31:05.680
 or what they are,

1:31:05.680 --> 1:31:07.520
 but every time there's a certain arrangement

1:31:07.520 --> 1:31:09.240
 of elements in space,

1:31:09.240 --> 1:31:12.200
 then arrangement in the sense of the way they're connected,

1:31:12.200 --> 1:31:14.640
 then we transform it into some other arrangement.

1:31:14.640 --> 1:31:16.280
 So there's a little tiny pattern

1:31:16.280 --> 1:31:18.520
 and you transform it into another little pattern.

1:31:18.520 --> 1:31:19.360
 That's right.

1:31:19.360 --> 1:31:20.840
 And then because of this,

1:31:20.840 --> 1:31:23.280
 I mean, again, it's kind of similar to cellular automata

1:31:23.280 --> 1:31:26.840
 in that like on paper, the rule looks like super simple.

1:31:26.840 --> 1:31:29.160
 It's like, yeah, okay.

1:31:30.480 --> 1:31:33.680
 Yeah, right, from this, the universe can be born.

1:31:33.680 --> 1:31:36.720
 But like once you start applying it,

1:31:36.720 --> 1:31:39.040
 beautiful structure starts being,

1:31:39.040 --> 1:31:41.000
 potentially can be created.

1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:43.560
 And what you're doing is you're applying that rule

1:31:43.560 --> 1:31:45.400
 to different parts,

1:31:45.400 --> 1:31:49.320
 like anytime you match it within the hypergraph.

1:31:49.320 --> 1:31:53.160
 And then one of the like incredibly beautiful

1:31:53.160 --> 1:31:55.640
 and interesting things to think about

1:31:55.640 --> 1:31:59.280
 is the order in which you apply that rule,

1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:02.000
 because that pattern appears all over the place.

1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:04.400
 Right, so this is a big complicated thing,

1:32:04.400 --> 1:32:06.200
 very hard to wrap one's brain around, okay?

1:32:06.200 --> 1:32:10.680
 So you say the rule is every time you see this little pattern

1:32:10.680 --> 1:32:12.520
 transform it in this way.

1:32:12.520 --> 1:32:15.800
 But yet, as you look around the space

1:32:15.800 --> 1:32:17.400
 that represents the universe,

1:32:17.400 --> 1:32:18.760
 there may be zillions of places

1:32:18.760 --> 1:32:20.600
 where that little pattern occurs.

1:32:20.600 --> 1:32:24.440
 So what it says is just do this,

1:32:24.440 --> 1:32:26.920
 apply this rule wherever you feel like.

1:32:26.920 --> 1:32:31.360
 And what is extremely non trivial is,

1:32:31.360 --> 1:32:33.520
 well, okay, so this is happening sort of

1:32:33.520 --> 1:32:35.920
 in computer science terms, sort of asynchronously,

1:32:35.920 --> 1:32:39.000
 you're just doing it wherever you feel like doing it.

1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:41.120
 And the only constraint is

1:32:41.120 --> 1:32:43.880
 that if you're going to apply the rule somewhere,

1:32:43.880 --> 1:32:46.760
 the things to which you apply the rule,

1:32:46.760 --> 1:32:50.080
 the little elements to which you apply the rule,

1:32:50.080 --> 1:32:54.200
 if they have to be,

1:32:54.200 --> 1:32:56.560
 okay, well, you can think of each application of the rule

1:32:56.560 --> 1:32:59.840
 as being kind of an event that happens in the universe.

1:32:59.840 --> 1:33:04.760
 And the input to an event has to be ready

1:33:04.760 --> 1:33:06.240
 for the event to occur.

1:33:06.240 --> 1:33:08.240
 That is, if one event occurred,

1:33:08.240 --> 1:33:10.000
 if one transformation occurred,

1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:12.720
 and it produced a particular atom of space,

1:33:12.720 --> 1:33:17.200
 then that atom of space has to already exist

1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:20.880
 before another transformation that's going to apply

1:33:20.880 --> 1:33:23.240
 to that atom of space can occur.

1:33:23.240 --> 1:33:25.840
 So that's like the prerequisite for the event.

1:33:25.840 --> 1:33:26.920
 That's right, that's right.

1:33:26.920 --> 1:33:30.520
 So that defines a kind of,

1:33:30.520 --> 1:33:33.840
 this sort of set of causal relationships between events.

1:33:33.840 --> 1:33:38.000
 It says, this event has to have happened before this event.

1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:40.200
 But that is...

1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:42.960
 But that's not a very limiting constraint.

1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:44.080
 No, it's not.

1:33:44.080 --> 1:33:44.960
 And what's interesting...

1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:47.200
 You still get the zillion,

1:33:47.200 --> 1:33:49.760
 that's a technical term, options.

1:33:49.760 --> 1:33:50.680
 That's correct.

1:33:50.680 --> 1:33:53.760
 But, okay, so this is where things get a little bit more

1:33:53.760 --> 1:33:54.600
 elaborate, but...

1:33:54.600 --> 1:33:56.640
 But they're mind blowing, so...

1:33:56.640 --> 1:33:59.120
 Right, but so what happens is,

1:33:59.120 --> 1:34:01.160
 so the first thing you might say is,

1:34:01.160 --> 1:34:02.520
 you know, let's...

1:34:02.520 --> 1:34:04.800
 Well, okay, so this question about the freedom

1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:07.200
 of which event you do when.

1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:10.200
 Well, let me sort of state an answer and then explain it.

1:34:10.200 --> 1:34:14.120
 Okay, the validity of special relativity

1:34:14.120 --> 1:34:17.000
 is a consequence of the fact that in some sense,

1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:19.240
 it doesn't matter in what order you do

1:34:19.240 --> 1:34:22.160
 these underlying things, so long as they respect

1:34:22.160 --> 1:34:24.440
 this kind of set of causal relationships.

1:34:25.400 --> 1:34:26.240
 So...

1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:30.640
 And that's the part that's in a certain sense

1:34:30.640 --> 1:34:31.800
 is a really important one,

1:34:31.800 --> 1:34:35.640
 but the fact that it sometimes doesn't matter,

1:34:35.640 --> 1:34:37.080
 that's a...

1:34:37.080 --> 1:34:37.920
 I don't know what to...

1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:38.760
 That's another, like, beautiful thing.

1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:40.520
 Well, okay, so there's this idea

1:34:40.520 --> 1:34:42.560
 of what I call causal invariance.

1:34:42.560 --> 1:34:44.080
 Causal invariance, exactly.

1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:44.920
 So that's a...

1:34:44.920 --> 1:34:46.240
 Really, really powerful idea.

1:34:46.240 --> 1:34:47.640
 Right, it's a powerful idea,

1:34:47.640 --> 1:34:50.080
 which has actually arisen in different forms

1:34:50.080 --> 1:34:52.040
 many times in the history of mathematics,

1:34:52.040 --> 1:34:54.880
 mathematical logic, even computer science,

1:34:54.880 --> 1:34:56.800
 has many different names.

1:34:56.800 --> 1:34:58.200
 I mean, our particular version of it

1:34:58.200 --> 1:35:00.240
 is a little bit tighter than other versions,

1:35:00.240 --> 1:35:01.480
 but it's basically the same idea.

1:35:01.480 --> 1:35:03.680
 Here's how to think about that idea.

1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:05.440
 So imagine that...

1:35:05.440 --> 1:35:08.120
 Well, let's talk about it in terms of math for a second.

1:35:08.120 --> 1:35:10.600
 Let's say you're doing algebra and you're told,

1:35:10.600 --> 1:35:14.280
 you know, multiply out this series of polynomials

1:35:14.280 --> 1:35:16.800
 that are multiplied together, okay?

1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:19.120
 You say, well, which order should I do that in?

1:35:19.120 --> 1:35:21.480
 Say, well, do I multiply the third one by the fourth one

1:35:21.480 --> 1:35:22.640
 and then do it by the first one?

1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:25.920
 Or do I do the fifth one by the sixth one and then do that?

1:35:25.920 --> 1:35:27.800
 Well, it turns out it doesn't matter.

1:35:27.800 --> 1:35:29.720
 You can multiply them out in any order,

1:35:29.720 --> 1:35:31.560
 you'll always get the same answer.

1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:33.760
 That's a property...

1:35:33.760 --> 1:35:36.240
 If you think about kind of making a kind of network

1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:38.720
 that represents in what order you do things,

1:35:38.720 --> 1:35:40.680
 you'll get different orders

1:35:40.680 --> 1:35:42.760
 for different ways of multiplying things out,

1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:44.880
 but you'll always get the same answer.

1:35:44.880 --> 1:35:45.720
 Same thing if you...

1:35:45.720 --> 1:35:46.680
 Let's say you're sorting.

1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:48.880
 You've got a bunch of A's and B's.

1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:50.280
 They're in random, some random order,

1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:53.400
 you know, BAA, BBBAA, whatever.

1:35:53.400 --> 1:35:55.240
 And you have a little rule that says,

1:35:55.240 --> 1:36:00.000
 every time you see BA, flip it around to AB, okay?

1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.280
 Eventually you apply that rule enough times,

1:36:02.280 --> 1:36:03.800
 you'll have sorted the string

1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:06.480
 so that it's all the A's first and then all the B's.

1:36:07.400 --> 1:36:10.040
 Again, there are many different orders

1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:13.200
 in which you can do that to many different sort of places

1:36:13.200 --> 1:36:15.280
 where you can apply that update.

1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:18.520
 In the end, you'll always get the string sorted the same way.

1:36:18.520 --> 1:36:22.320
 I know with sorting the string, it sounds obvious.

1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:23.600
 That's to me surprising

1:36:24.680 --> 1:36:28.320
 that there is in complicated systems,

1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:29.840
 obviously with a string,

1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:33.760
 but in a hypergraph that the application of the rule,

1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:36.720
 asynchronous rule can lead to the same results sometimes.

1:36:36.720 --> 1:36:39.080
 Yes, yes, that is not obvious.

1:36:39.080 --> 1:36:40.720
 And it was something that, you know,

1:36:40.720 --> 1:36:44.080
 I sort of discovered that idea for these kinds of systems

1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:45.520
 and back in the 1990s.

1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:50.360
 And for various reasons, I was not satisfied

1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:54.320
 by how sort of fragile finding that particular property was.

1:36:54.320 --> 1:36:56.360
 And let me just make another point,

1:36:56.360 --> 1:37:01.120
 which is that it turns out that even if the underlying rule

1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:03.880
 does not have this property of causal invariance,

1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:06.200
 it can turn out that every observation

1:37:06.200 --> 1:37:09.240
 made by observers of the rule can,

1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:12.680
 they can impose what amounts to causal invariance

1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:13.880
 on the rule.

1:37:13.880 --> 1:37:14.720
 We can explain that.

1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:15.560
 It's a little bit more complicated.

1:37:15.560 --> 1:37:18.000
 I mean, technically that has to do with this idea

1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:20.160
 of completions, which is something that comes up

1:37:20.160 --> 1:37:21.760
 in term rewriting systems,

1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:24.040
 automated theorem proving systems and so on.

1:37:24.040 --> 1:37:26.320
 But let's ignore that for a second.

1:37:26.320 --> 1:37:27.560
 We can come to that later.

1:37:27.560 --> 1:37:29.840
 But is it useful to talk about observation?

1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:30.680
 Not yet.

1:37:30.680 --> 1:37:31.720
 Not yet.

1:37:31.720 --> 1:37:33.160
 It's so great.

1:37:33.160 --> 1:37:35.560
 So there's some concept of causal invariance

1:37:35.560 --> 1:37:39.480
 as you apply these rules in an asynchronous way,

1:37:39.480 --> 1:37:42.200
 you can think of those transformations as events.

1:37:42.200 --> 1:37:44.400
 So there's this hypergraph that represents space

1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:47.000
 and all of these events happening in the space

1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:50.440
 and the graph grows in interesting complicated ways.

1:37:50.440 --> 1:37:54.560
 And eventually the froth arises of what we experience

1:37:54.560 --> 1:37:56.200
 as human existence.

1:37:56.200 --> 1:37:57.440
 So that's it.

1:37:57.440 --> 1:37:58.920
 That's some version of the picture,

1:37:58.920 --> 1:38:00.800
 but let's explain a little bit more.

1:38:00.800 --> 1:38:01.640
 Exactly.

1:38:01.640 --> 1:38:03.600
 What's a little more detail like?

1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:04.440
 Right.

1:38:04.440 --> 1:38:06.760
 Well, so one thing that is sort of surprising

1:38:06.760 --> 1:38:10.080
 in this theory is one of the sort of achievements

1:38:10.080 --> 1:38:12.000
 of 20th century physics was kind of bringing

1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:13.880
 space and time together.

1:38:13.880 --> 1:38:15.720
 That was, you know, special relativity.

1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:19.320
 People talk about space time, this sort of unified thing

1:38:19.320 --> 1:38:21.880
 where space and time kind of a mixed

1:38:21.880 --> 1:38:24.680
 and there's a nice mathematical formalism

1:38:24.680 --> 1:38:28.040
 that in which, you know, space and time sort of appear

1:38:28.040 --> 1:38:30.760
 as part of the space time continuum,

1:38:30.760 --> 1:38:34.480
 the space time, you know, four vectors and things like this.

1:38:34.480 --> 1:38:37.320
 You know, we talk about time as the fourth dimension

1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:38.800
 and all these kinds of things.

1:38:38.800 --> 1:38:42.200
 It's, you know, and it seems like the theory of relativity

1:38:42.200 --> 1:38:44.040
 sort of says space and time are fundamentally

1:38:44.040 --> 1:38:45.400
 the same kind of thing.

1:38:45.400 --> 1:38:48.680
 So one of the things that took a while to understand

1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:53.680
 in this approach of mine is that in my kind of approach,

1:38:54.880 --> 1:38:56.680
 space and time are really not fundamentally

1:38:56.680 --> 1:38:57.520
 the same kind of thing.

1:38:57.520 --> 1:39:00.480
 Space is the extension of this hypergraph.

1:39:00.480 --> 1:39:04.440
 Time is the kind of progress of this inexorable computation

1:39:04.440 --> 1:39:07.040
 of these rules getting applied to the hypergraph.

1:39:07.040 --> 1:39:10.000
 So it's, they seem like very different kinds of things.

1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:12.760
 And so that at first seems like

1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:14.160
 how can that possibly be right?

1:39:14.160 --> 1:39:16.440
 How can that possibly be Lorentz invariant?

1:39:16.440 --> 1:39:18.840
 That's the term for things being, you know,

1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:21.600
 following the rules of special relativity.

1:39:21.600 --> 1:39:26.120
 Well, it turns out that when you have causal invariants

1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:30.120
 that, and let's see, we can, it's worth explaining

1:39:30.120 --> 1:39:31.000
 a little bit how this works.

1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:32.440
 It's a little bit elaborate,

1:39:32.440 --> 1:39:37.440
 but the basic point is that even though space and time

1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:41.640
 sort of come from very different places,

1:39:41.640 --> 1:39:45.360
 it turns out that the rules of sort of space time

1:39:45.360 --> 1:39:50.360
 that special relativity talks about come out of this model

1:39:51.080 --> 1:39:53.680
 when you're looking at large enough systems.

1:39:53.680 --> 1:39:56.080
 So a way to think about this, you know,

1:39:56.080 --> 1:39:59.480
 in terms of when you're looking at large enough systems,

1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:03.800
 the part of that story is when you look at some fluid

1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:06.280
 like water, for example, there are equations

1:40:06.280 --> 1:40:07.860
 that govern the flow of water.

1:40:08.920 --> 1:40:12.720
 Those equations are things that apply on a large scale.

1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:14.400
 If you look at the individual molecules,

1:40:14.400 --> 1:40:16.280
 they don't know anything about those equations.

1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:19.360
 It's just the sort of the large scale effect

1:40:19.360 --> 1:40:22.800
 of those molecules turns out to follow those equations.

1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:25.960
 And it's the same kind of thing happening in our models.

1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:27.960
 I know this might be a small point,

1:40:27.960 --> 1:40:29.600
 but it might be a very big one.

1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:32.560
 We've been talking about space and time

1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:35.960
 at the lowest level of the model, which is space.

1:40:35.960 --> 1:40:39.860
 The hypergraph time is the evolution of this hypergraph.

1:40:39.860 --> 1:40:43.160
 But there's also space time that we think about

1:40:43.160 --> 1:40:46.400
 and general relativity for your special relativity.

1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:52.400
 Like how do you go from the lowest source code

1:40:54.080 --> 1:40:55.960
 of space and time as we're talking about

1:40:55.960 --> 1:40:58.720
 to the more traditional terminology of space and time?

1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:01.840
 So the key thing is this thing we call the causal graph.

1:41:01.840 --> 1:41:03.760
 So the causal graph is the graph

1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:06.660
 of causal relationships between events.

1:41:06.660 --> 1:41:08.980
 So every one of these little updating events,

1:41:08.980 --> 1:41:10.320
 every one of these little transformations

1:41:10.320 --> 1:41:13.360
 of the hypergraph happens somewhere in the hypergraph,

1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:16.800
 happens at some stage in the computation.

1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:18.240
 That's an event.

1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:22.280
 That event has a causal relationship to other events

1:41:22.280 --> 1:41:27.280
 in the sense that if another event needs as its input,

1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:29.440
 the output from the first event,

1:41:29.440 --> 1:41:31.140
 there will be a causal relationship

1:41:31.140 --> 1:41:35.220
 of the future event will depend on the past event.

1:41:35.220 --> 1:41:37.960
 So you can say it has a causal connection.

1:41:37.960 --> 1:41:39.760
 And so you can make this graph

1:41:39.760 --> 1:41:42.440
 of causal relationships between events.

1:41:42.440 --> 1:41:44.240
 That graph of causal relationships,

1:41:44.240 --> 1:41:47.680
 causal invariance implies that that graph is unique.

1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:51.280
 It doesn't matter even though you think,

1:41:51.280 --> 1:41:54.160
 oh, I'm, let's say we were sorting a string, for example,

1:41:54.160 --> 1:41:57.720
 I did that particular transposition of characters

1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:00.180
 at this time, then I did that one, then I did this one.

1:42:00.180 --> 1:42:03.000
 Turns out if you look at the network of connections

1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:06.680
 between those updating events, that network is the same.

1:42:06.680 --> 1:42:11.040
 It's the, if you were to, the structure.

1:42:11.040 --> 1:42:13.360
 So in other words, if you were to draw that,

1:42:13.360 --> 1:42:15.440
 if you were to put that network on a picture

1:42:15.440 --> 1:42:17.100
 of where you're doing all the updating,

1:42:17.100 --> 1:42:20.080
 the places where you put the nodes of the network

1:42:20.080 --> 1:42:22.440
 will be different, but the way the nodes are connected

1:42:22.440 --> 1:42:23.560
 will always be the same.

1:42:23.560 --> 1:42:27.320
 So, but the causal graph is, I don't know,

1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:31.080
 it's kind of an observation, it's not enforced,

1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:33.760
 it's just emergent from a set of events.

1:42:33.760 --> 1:42:36.440
 It's a feature of, okay, so what it is is.

1:42:36.440 --> 1:42:38.860
 The characteristic, I guess, of the way events happen.

1:42:38.860 --> 1:42:40.800
 Right, it's an event can't happen

1:42:40.800 --> 1:42:42.520
 until its input is ready.

1:42:42.520 --> 1:42:46.360
 And so that creates this network of causal relationships.

1:42:46.360 --> 1:42:48.280
 And that's the causal graph.

1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:51.560
 And the thing that the next thing to realize is,

1:42:51.560 --> 1:42:54.480
 okay, we, when you're going to observe

1:42:54.480 --> 1:42:56.400
 what happens in the universe,

1:42:56.400 --> 1:42:59.560
 you have to sort of make sense of this causal graph.

1:42:59.560 --> 1:43:02.840
 So, and you are an observer who yourself

1:43:02.840 --> 1:43:05.040
 is part of this causal graph.

1:43:05.040 --> 1:43:07.520
 And so that means, so let me give you an example

1:43:07.520 --> 1:43:08.360
 of how that works.

1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:11.160
 So imagine we have a really weird theory of physics

1:43:11.160 --> 1:43:15.100
 of the world where it says this updating process,

1:43:15.100 --> 1:43:18.180
 there's only gonna be one update at every moment in time.

1:43:18.180 --> 1:43:19.720
 And there's just gonna be like a Turing machine.

1:43:19.720 --> 1:43:21.520
 It has a little head that runs around

1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:23.680
 and just is always just updating one thing at a time.

1:43:23.680 --> 1:43:26.040
 So you say, I have a theory of physics

1:43:26.040 --> 1:43:27.480
 and the theory of physics says,

1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:30.440
 there's just this one little place where things get updated.

1:43:30.440 --> 1:43:32.960
 You say, that's completely crazy because,

1:43:32.960 --> 1:43:35.860
 it's plainly obvious that things are being updated

1:43:35.860 --> 1:43:37.120
 sort of at the same time.

1:43:37.120 --> 1:43:39.280
 Async obviously, yeah, at the same time, yeah.

1:43:39.280 --> 1:43:44.240
 But the fact is that the thing is that if I'm talking to you

1:43:44.240 --> 1:43:47.200
 and you seem to be being updated as I'm being updated,

1:43:47.200 --> 1:43:48.960
 but if there's just this one little head

1:43:48.960 --> 1:43:51.000
 that's running around updating things,

1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:53.440
 I will not know whether you've been updated or not

1:43:53.440 --> 1:43:55.440
 until I'm updated.

1:43:55.440 --> 1:43:58.640
 So in other words, draw this causal graph

1:43:58.640 --> 1:44:01.000
 of the causal relationship between the updatings in you

1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:02.440
 and the updatings in me,

1:44:02.440 --> 1:44:04.400
 it'll still be the same causal graph,

1:44:04.400 --> 1:44:07.120
 whether even though the underlying sort of story

1:44:07.120 --> 1:44:10.120
 of what happens is, oh, there's just this one little thing

1:44:10.120 --> 1:44:12.840
 and it goes and updates in different places in the universe.

1:44:12.840 --> 1:44:17.840
 So is that clear or is that a hypothesis?

1:44:18.040 --> 1:44:21.440
 Is that clear that there's a unique causal graph?

1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:24.880
 If there's causal invariance, there's unique causal graph.

1:44:24.880 --> 1:44:28.060
 So it's okay to think of what we're talking about

1:44:28.060 --> 1:44:30.600
 as a hypergraph and the operations on it

1:44:30.600 --> 1:44:32.960
 as a kind of touring machine with a single head,

1:44:32.960 --> 1:44:35.760
 like a single guy running around updating stuff.

1:44:37.120 --> 1:44:40.520
 Is that safe to intuitively think of it this way?

1:44:40.520 --> 1:44:41.680
 Let me think about that for a second.

1:44:41.680 --> 1:44:42.560
 Yes, I think so.

1:44:42.560 --> 1:44:44.800
 I think there's nothing, it doesn't matter.

1:44:44.800 --> 1:44:47.980
 I mean, you can say, okay, there is one,

1:44:47.980 --> 1:44:52.880
 the reason I'm pausing for a second is that I'm wondering,

1:44:52.880 --> 1:44:55.840
 well, when you say running around,

1:44:55.840 --> 1:44:57.960
 depends how far it jumps every time it runs.

1:44:57.960 --> 1:44:59.160
 Yeah, yeah, that's right.

1:44:59.160 --> 1:45:02.000
 But I mean like one operation at a time.

1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:03.760
 Yeah, you can think of it as one operation at a time.

1:45:03.760 --> 1:45:06.680
 It's easier for the human brain to think of it that way

1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:08.240
 as opposed to simultaneous.

1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:10.720
 Well, maybe it's not, okay, but the thing is

1:45:10.720 --> 1:45:12.720
 that's not how we experience the world.

1:45:12.720 --> 1:45:15.760
 What we experience is we look around,

1:45:15.760 --> 1:45:17.880
 everything seems to be happening

1:45:17.880 --> 1:45:21.000
 at successive moments in time everywhere in space.

1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:21.840
 Yes.

1:45:21.840 --> 1:45:23.880
 That is the, and that's partly a feature

1:45:23.880 --> 1:45:25.580
 of our particular construction.

1:45:25.580 --> 1:45:28.480
 I mean, that is the speed of light is really fast

1:45:28.480 --> 1:45:30.680
 compared to, you know, we look around, you know,

1:45:30.680 --> 1:45:33.800
 I can see maybe a hundred feet away right now.

1:45:33.800 --> 1:45:38.800
 You know, it's the, my brain does not process very much

1:45:38.800 --> 1:45:41.280
 in the time it takes light to go a hundred feet.

1:45:41.280 --> 1:45:44.040
 The brain operates at a scale of hundreds of milliseconds

1:45:44.040 --> 1:45:45.320
 or something like that, I don't know.

1:45:45.320 --> 1:45:46.160
 Right.

1:45:46.160 --> 1:45:47.600
 And speed of light is much faster.

1:45:47.600 --> 1:45:49.160
 Right, you know, light goes,

1:45:49.160 --> 1:45:51.000
 in a billionth of a second light has gone afoot.

1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:53.720
 So it goes a billion feet every second.

1:45:53.720 --> 1:45:56.480
 There's certain moments through this conversation

1:45:56.480 --> 1:46:01.200
 where I imagine the absurdity of the fact

1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:05.080
 that there's two descendants of apes modeled by a hypergraph

1:46:05.080 --> 1:46:06.400
 that are communicating with each other

1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:09.160
 and experiencing this whole thing

1:46:09.160 --> 1:46:13.440
 as a real time simultaneous update with,

1:46:13.440 --> 1:46:15.440
 I'm taking in photons from you right now,

1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:19.160
 but there's something much, much deeper going on here.

1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:20.000
 Right, it does have a.

1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:22.560
 It's paralyzing sometimes to just.

1:46:22.560 --> 1:46:23.400
 Yes.

1:46:23.400 --> 1:46:24.220
 To remember that.

1:46:24.220 --> 1:46:26.400
 Right, no, I mean, you know, it's a, you know.

1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:27.240
 Sorry.

1:46:27.240 --> 1:46:28.080
 Yes, yes, no.

1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:30.800
 As a small little tangent, I just remembered

1:46:30.800 --> 1:46:32.360
 that we're talking about,

1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:37.080
 I mean, about the fabric of reality.

1:46:37.080 --> 1:46:40.080
 Right, so we've got this causal graph

1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:41.920
 that represents the sort of causal relationships

1:46:41.920 --> 1:46:43.760
 between all these events in the universe.

1:46:43.760 --> 1:46:47.680
 That causal graph kind of is a representation of space time,

1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:50.800
 but our experience of it requires

1:46:50.800 --> 1:46:52.960
 that we pick reference frames.

1:46:52.960 --> 1:46:54.200
 This is kind of a key idea.

1:46:54.200 --> 1:46:57.440
 Einstein had this idea that what that means is

1:46:57.440 --> 1:47:01.040
 we have to say, what are we going to pick

1:47:01.040 --> 1:47:04.540
 as being the sort of what we define

1:47:04.540 --> 1:47:06.840
 as simultaneous moments in time?

1:47:07.680 --> 1:47:11.400
 So for example, we can say, you know,

1:47:11.400 --> 1:47:13.040
 how do we set our clocks?

1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:16.420
 You know, if we've got a spacecraft landing on Mars,

1:47:16.420 --> 1:47:17.840
 you know, do we say that, you know,

1:47:17.840 --> 1:47:19.480
 what time is it landing at?

1:47:19.480 --> 1:47:21.640
 Was it, you know, even though there's a 20 minute

1:47:21.640 --> 1:47:23.760
 speed of light delay or something, you know,

1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:25.340
 what time do we say it landed at?

1:47:25.340 --> 1:47:30.020
 How do we set up sort of time coordinates for the world?

1:47:30.020 --> 1:47:32.400
 And that turns out to be that there's kind of

1:47:32.400 --> 1:47:35.960
 this arbitrariness to how we set these reference frames

1:47:35.960 --> 1:47:39.200
 that defines sort of what counts as simultaneous.

1:47:39.200 --> 1:47:42.020
 And what is the essence of special relativity

1:47:42.020 --> 1:47:45.880
 is to think about reference frames going at different speeds

1:47:45.880 --> 1:47:48.760
 and to think about sort of how they assign,

1:47:48.760 --> 1:47:51.460
 what counts as space, what counts as time and so on.

1:47:52.320 --> 1:47:55.680
 That's all a bit technical, but the basic bottom line is

1:47:55.680 --> 1:47:58.920
 that this causal invariance property,

1:47:58.920 --> 1:48:01.800
 that means that it's always the same causal graph,

1:48:01.800 --> 1:48:04.760
 independent of how you slice it with these reference frames,

1:48:04.760 --> 1:48:07.840
 you'll always sort of see the same physical processes go on.

1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:10.380
 And that's basically why special relativity works.

1:48:10.380 --> 1:48:14.620
 So there's something like special relativity,

1:48:14.620 --> 1:48:17.680
 like everything around space and time

1:48:17.680 --> 1:48:22.680
 that fits this idea of the causal graph.

1:48:22.900 --> 1:48:24.900
 Right, well, you know, one way to think about it is

1:48:24.900 --> 1:48:27.280
 given that you have a basic structure

1:48:27.280 --> 1:48:31.040
 that just involves updating things in these,

1:48:31.040 --> 1:48:33.280
 you know, connected updates and looking at

1:48:33.280 --> 1:48:35.640
 the causal relationships between connected updates,

1:48:35.640 --> 1:48:39.760
 that's enough when you unravel the consequences of that,

1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:41.500
 that together with the fact that there are lots

1:48:41.500 --> 1:48:43.880
 of these things and that you can take a continuum limit

1:48:43.880 --> 1:48:46.900
 and so on implies special relativity.

1:48:46.900 --> 1:48:51.000
 And so that, it's kind of not a big deal

1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:52.920
 because it's kind of a, you know,

1:48:52.920 --> 1:48:56.520
 it was completely unobvious when you started off

1:48:56.520 --> 1:48:57.860
 with saying, we've got this graph,

1:48:57.860 --> 1:49:00.200
 it's being updated in time, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,

1:49:00.200 --> 1:49:03.280
 that just looks like nothing to do with special relativity.

1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:05.040
 And yet you get that.

1:49:05.040 --> 1:49:08.080
 And what, I mean, then the thing,

1:49:08.080 --> 1:49:11.160
 I mean, this was stuff that I figured out back in the 1990s.

1:49:11.160 --> 1:49:15.140
 The next big thing you get is general relativity.

1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:18.920
 And so in this hypergraph,

1:49:18.920 --> 1:49:20.700
 the sort of limiting structure,

1:49:20.700 --> 1:49:22.440
 when you have a very big hypergraph,

1:49:22.440 --> 1:49:24.480
 you can think of as being just like, you know,

1:49:24.480 --> 1:49:27.040
 water seems continuous on a large scale.

1:49:27.040 --> 1:49:30.140
 So this hypergraph seems continuous on a large scale.

1:49:30.140 --> 1:49:31.660
 One question is, you know,

1:49:31.660 --> 1:49:35.200
 how many dimensions of space does it correspond to?

1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:36.440
 So one question you can ask is,

1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:38.000
 if you've just got a bunch of points

1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:39.480
 and they're connected together,

1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:43.160
 how do you deduce what effective dimension of space

1:49:43.160 --> 1:49:46.000
 that bundle of points corresponds to?

1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:47.680
 And that's pretty easy to explain.

1:49:47.680 --> 1:49:50.520
 So basically if you say you've got a point

1:49:50.520 --> 1:49:52.760
 and you look at how many neighbors does that point have?

1:49:52.760 --> 1:49:54.680
 Okay, imagine it's on a square grid.

1:49:54.680 --> 1:49:56.260
 Then it'll have four neighbors.

1:49:56.260 --> 1:49:58.280
 Go another level out.

1:49:58.280 --> 1:50:00.000
 How many neighbors do you get then?

1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:02.800
 What you realize is as you go more and more levels out,

1:50:02.800 --> 1:50:05.920
 as you go more and more distance on the graph out,

1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:09.700
 you're capturing something which is essentially a circle

1:50:09.700 --> 1:50:11.920
 in two dimensions so that, you know,

1:50:11.920 --> 1:50:14.720
 the number of the area of a circle is pi R squared.

1:50:14.720 --> 1:50:18.400
 So it's the number of points that you get to

1:50:18.400 --> 1:50:21.540
 goes up like the distance you've gone squared.

1:50:21.540 --> 1:50:24.440
 And in general, in D dimensional space,

1:50:24.440 --> 1:50:25.940
 it's R to the power D.

1:50:25.940 --> 1:50:28.680
 It's the number of points you get to

1:50:28.680 --> 1:50:32.720
 if you go R steps on the graph grows like

1:50:32.720 --> 1:50:35.560
 the number of steps you go to the power of the dimension.

1:50:35.560 --> 1:50:37.760
 And that's a way that you can estimate

1:50:37.760 --> 1:50:39.960
 the effective dimension of one of these graphs.

1:50:39.960 --> 1:50:41.080
 So what does that grow to?

1:50:41.080 --> 1:50:42.540
 So how does the dimension grow?

1:50:42.540 --> 1:50:45.900
 There's a, I mean, obviously the visual aspect

1:50:45.900 --> 1:50:47.380
 of these hypergraphs,

1:50:47.380 --> 1:50:50.120
 they're often visualized in three dimensions.

1:50:50.120 --> 1:50:50.960
 Right.

1:50:50.960 --> 1:50:52.720
 So there's a certain kind of structure,

1:50:54.640 --> 1:50:58.880
 like you said, there's, I mean, a circle, a sphere,

1:50:58.880 --> 1:51:01.080
 there's a planar aspect to it,

1:51:02.360 --> 1:51:04.680
 to this graph to where it kind of,

1:51:04.680 --> 1:51:06.760
 it almost starts creating a surface,

1:51:06.760 --> 1:51:09.120
 like a complicated surface, but a surface.

1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:11.880
 So how does that connect to effective dimension?

1:51:11.880 --> 1:51:14.400
 Okay, so if you can lay out the graph

1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:18.880
 in such a way that the points in the graph that,

1:51:18.880 --> 1:51:21.360
 you know, the points that are neighbors on the graph

1:51:21.360 --> 1:51:23.520
 are neighbors as you lay them out,

1:51:23.520 --> 1:51:25.680
 and you can do that in two dimensions,

1:51:25.680 --> 1:51:28.360
 then it's gonna approximate a two dimensional thing.

1:51:28.360 --> 1:51:29.760
 If you can't do that in two dimensions,

1:51:29.760 --> 1:51:31.240
 if everything would have to fold over a lot

1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:32.240
 in two dimensions,

1:51:32.240 --> 1:51:34.080
 then it's not approximating a two dimensional thing.

1:51:34.080 --> 1:51:36.200
 Maybe you can lay it out in three dimensions.

1:51:36.200 --> 1:51:38.640
 Maybe you have to lay it out in five dimensions

1:51:38.640 --> 1:51:39.640
 to have it be the case

1:51:39.640 --> 1:51:42.000
 that it sort of smoothly lays out like that.

1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:44.720
 Well, but okay, so I apologize

1:51:44.720 --> 1:51:46.060
 for the different tangent questions,

1:51:46.060 --> 1:51:49.440
 but you know, there's an infinity number of possible rules.

1:51:51.320 --> 1:51:54.600
 So we have to look for rules

1:51:54.600 --> 1:51:58.520
 that create the kind of structures

1:51:58.520 --> 1:52:00.580
 that are reminiscent for,

1:52:01.560 --> 1:52:05.080
 that have echoes of the different physics theories in them.

1:52:05.080 --> 1:52:06.600
 So what kind of rules,

1:52:06.600 --> 1:52:08.240
 is there something simple to be said

1:52:08.240 --> 1:52:12.080
 about the kind of rules that you have found beautiful,

1:52:12.080 --> 1:52:13.480
 that you have found powerful?

1:52:13.480 --> 1:52:15.400
 Right, so I mean, what, you know,

1:52:15.400 --> 1:52:18.760
 one of the features of computational irreducibility is,

1:52:18.760 --> 1:52:21.980
 it's very, you can't say in advance,

1:52:21.980 --> 1:52:23.960
 what's gonna happen with any particular,

1:52:23.960 --> 1:52:26.000
 you can't say, I'm gonna pick these rules

1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:28.900
 from this part of rule space, so to speak,

1:52:28.900 --> 1:52:30.960
 because they're gonna be the ones that are gonna work.

1:52:30.960 --> 1:52:33.360
 That's, you can make some statements along those lines,

1:52:33.360 --> 1:52:35.200
 but you can't generally say that.

1:52:35.200 --> 1:52:38.280
 Now, you know, the state of what we've been able to do

1:52:38.280 --> 1:52:40.680
 is, you know, different properties of the universe,

1:52:40.680 --> 1:52:44.600
 like dimensionality, you know, integer dimensionality,

1:52:44.600 --> 1:52:47.960
 features of other features of quantum mechanics,

1:52:47.960 --> 1:52:48.960
 things like that.

1:52:48.960 --> 1:52:50.600
 At this point, what we've got is,

1:52:50.600 --> 1:52:55.380
 we've got rules that any one of those features,

1:52:55.380 --> 1:52:58.080
 we can get a rule that has that feature.

1:52:58.080 --> 1:52:58.920
 Yeah, so the.

1:52:58.920 --> 1:53:00.720
 We don't have the sort of, the final,

1:53:00.720 --> 1:53:02.640
 here's a rule which has all of these features,

1:53:02.640 --> 1:53:03.680
 we do not have that yet.

1:53:03.680 --> 1:53:06.960
 So if I were to try to summarize

1:53:06.960 --> 1:53:11.380
 the Wolfram physics project, which is, you know,

1:53:11.380 --> 1:53:13.920
 something that's been in your brain for a long time,

1:53:13.920 --> 1:53:17.280
 but really has just exploded in activity,

1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:19.160
 you know, only just months ago.

1:53:19.160 --> 1:53:20.040
 Yes.

1:53:20.040 --> 1:53:23.480
 So it's an evolving thing, and next week,

1:53:23.480 --> 1:53:24.920
 I'll try to publish this conversation

1:53:24.920 --> 1:53:27.840
 as quickly as possible, because by the time it's published,

1:53:27.840 --> 1:53:29.640
 already new things will probably have come out.

1:53:29.640 --> 1:53:33.180
 So if I were to summarize it,

1:53:33.180 --> 1:53:35.940
 we've talked about the basics of,

1:53:35.940 --> 1:53:38.360
 there's a hypergraph that represents space,

1:53:38.360 --> 1:53:42.360
 there is transformations in that hypergraph

1:53:42.360 --> 1:53:44.720
 that represents time.

1:53:44.720 --> 1:53:45.560
 The progress of time.

1:53:45.560 --> 1:53:47.840
 The progress of time, there's a causal graph

1:53:47.840 --> 1:53:49.640
 that's a characteristic of this,

1:53:49.640 --> 1:53:53.720
 and the basic process of science,

1:53:53.720 --> 1:53:58.640
 of, yeah, of science within the Wolfram physics model

1:53:58.640 --> 1:54:02.560
 is to try different rules and see which properties

1:54:02.560 --> 1:54:06.120
 of physics that we know of, known physical theories,

1:54:06.120 --> 1:54:10.700
 are, appear within the graphs that emerge from that rule.

1:54:10.700 --> 1:54:12.400
 That's what I thought it was going to be.

1:54:12.400 --> 1:54:13.660
 Uh oh, okay.

1:54:13.660 --> 1:54:16.080
 So what is it?

1:54:16.080 --> 1:54:18.200
 It turns out we can do a lot better than that.

1:54:18.200 --> 1:54:21.400
 It turns out that using kind of mathematical ideas,

1:54:21.400 --> 1:54:25.140
 we can say, and computational ideas,

1:54:25.140 --> 1:54:28.400
 we can make general statements,

1:54:28.400 --> 1:54:31.520
 and those general statements turn out to correspond

1:54:31.520 --> 1:54:34.080
 to things that we know from 20th century physics.

1:54:34.080 --> 1:54:36.940
 In other words, the idea of you just try a bunch of rules

1:54:36.940 --> 1:54:37.780
 and see what they do,

1:54:37.780 --> 1:54:40.240
 that's what I thought we were gonna have to do.

1:54:40.240 --> 1:54:43.760
 But in fact, we can say, given causal invariance

1:54:43.760 --> 1:54:47.480
 and computational irreducibility, we can derive,

1:54:47.480 --> 1:54:49.480
 and this is where it gets really pretty interesting,

1:54:49.480 --> 1:54:51.120
 we can derive special relativity,

1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:52.920
 we can derive general relativity,

1:54:52.920 --> 1:54:55.140
 we can derive quantum mechanics.

1:54:55.140 --> 1:54:58.280
 And that's where things really start to get exciting,

1:54:58.280 --> 1:55:01.340
 is, you know, it wasn't at all obvious to me

1:55:01.340 --> 1:55:03.360
 that even if we were completely correct,

1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:05.240
 and even if we had, you know, this is the rule,

1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:06.920
 you know, even if we found the rule,

1:55:06.920 --> 1:55:08.940
 to be able to say, yes, it corresponds

1:55:08.940 --> 1:55:10.360
 to things we already know,

1:55:10.360 --> 1:55:12.660
 I did not expect that to be the case.

1:55:12.660 --> 1:55:13.500
 And...

1:55:13.500 --> 1:55:16.920
 So for somebody who is a simple mind

1:55:16.920 --> 1:55:19.460
 and definitely not a physicist, not even close,

1:55:19.460 --> 1:55:22.760
 what does derivation mean in this case?

1:55:22.760 --> 1:55:26.940
 Okay, so let me, this is an interesting question.

1:55:26.940 --> 1:55:29.160
 Okay, so there's, so one thing...

1:55:29.160 --> 1:55:31.880
 In the context of computational irreducibility.

1:55:31.880 --> 1:55:32.920
 Yeah, yeah, right, right.

1:55:32.920 --> 1:55:36.840
 So what you have to do, let me go back to, again,

1:55:36.840 --> 1:55:39.000
 the mundane example of fluids and water

1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:40.400
 and things like that, right?

1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:44.040
 So you have a bunch of molecules bouncing around.

1:55:44.040 --> 1:55:47.340
 You can say, just as a piece of mathematics,

1:55:47.340 --> 1:55:49.260
 I happen to do this from cellular automata

1:55:49.260 --> 1:55:52.160
 back in the mid 1980s, you can say,

1:55:52.160 --> 1:55:54.200
 just as a matter of mathematics,

1:55:54.200 --> 1:55:57.240
 you can say the continuum limit

1:55:57.240 --> 1:55:59.240
 of these little molecules bouncing around

1:55:59.240 --> 1:56:01.640
 is the Navier Stokes equations.

1:56:01.640 --> 1:56:03.260
 That's just a piece of mathematics.

1:56:03.260 --> 1:56:06.640
 It's not, it doesn't rely on...

1:56:06.640 --> 1:56:08.480
 You have to make certain assumptions

1:56:08.480 --> 1:56:10.880
 that you have to say there's enough randomness

1:56:10.880 --> 1:56:12.400
 in the way the molecules bounce around

1:56:12.400 --> 1:56:14.240
 that certain statistical averages work,

1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:15.680
 et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:18.320
 Okay, it is a very similar derivation

1:56:18.320 --> 1:56:21.220
 to derive, for example, the Einstein equations.

1:56:21.220 --> 1:56:23.720
 Okay, so the way that works, roughly,

1:56:23.720 --> 1:56:26.740
 the Einstein equations are about curvature of space.

1:56:26.740 --> 1:56:29.080
 Curvature of space, I talked about sort of

1:56:29.080 --> 1:56:31.840
 how you can figure out dimension of space.

1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:34.260
 There's a similar kind of way of figuring out

1:56:34.260 --> 1:56:37.240
 if you just sort of say, you know,

1:56:37.240 --> 1:56:39.040
 you're making a larger and larger ball

1:56:39.040 --> 1:56:40.920
 or larger and larger, if you draw a circle

1:56:40.920 --> 1:56:42.940
 on the surface of the earth, for example,

1:56:42.940 --> 1:56:45.980
 you might think the area of a circle is pi r squared,

1:56:45.980 --> 1:56:47.940
 but on the surface of the earth,

1:56:47.940 --> 1:56:50.560
 because it's a sphere, it's not flat,

1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:53.360
 the area of a circle isn't precisely pi r squared.

1:56:53.360 --> 1:56:56.240
 As the circle gets bigger, the area is slightly smaller

1:56:56.240 --> 1:56:58.160
 than you would expect from the formula pi r squared

1:56:58.160 --> 1:57:01.040
 as a little correction term that depends on the ratio

1:57:01.040 --> 1:57:03.700
 of the size of the circle to the radius of the earth.

1:57:03.700 --> 1:57:05.680
 Okay, so it's the same basic thing,

1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:08.240
 allows you to measure from one of these hypergraphs

1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:10.100
 what is its effective curvature.

1:57:11.240 --> 1:57:12.080
 And that's...

1:57:12.080 --> 1:57:15.440
 So the little piece of mathematics

1:57:15.440 --> 1:57:18.320
 that explains special general relativity

1:57:20.960 --> 1:57:25.400
 can map nicely to describe fundamental property

1:57:25.400 --> 1:57:27.560
 of the hypergraphs, the curvature of the hypergraphs.

1:57:27.560 --> 1:57:31.280
 So special relativity is about the relationship

1:57:31.280 --> 1:57:32.720
 of time to space.

1:57:32.720 --> 1:57:35.280
 General relativity is about curvature

1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:38.600
 and this space represented by this hypergraph.

1:57:38.600 --> 1:57:40.760
 So what is the curvature of a hypergraph?

1:57:40.760 --> 1:57:43.120
 Okay, so first I have to explain,

1:57:43.120 --> 1:57:44.680
 what we're explaining is,

1:57:44.680 --> 1:57:47.120
 first thing you have to have is a notion of dimension.

1:57:47.120 --> 1:57:49.280
 You don't get to talk about curvature of things.

1:57:49.280 --> 1:57:51.800
 If you say, oh, it's a curved line,

1:57:51.800 --> 1:57:53.800
 but I don't know what a line is yet.

1:57:53.800 --> 1:57:54.640
 So...

1:57:54.640 --> 1:57:56.960
 Yeah, what is the dimension of a hypergraph then?

1:57:56.960 --> 1:58:00.580
 From where, we've talked about effective dimension, but...

1:58:00.580 --> 1:58:03.080
 Right, that's what this is about.

1:58:03.080 --> 1:58:05.180
 What this is about is, you have your hypergraph,

1:58:05.180 --> 1:58:07.380
 it's got a trillion nodes in it.

1:58:07.380 --> 1:58:08.740
 What is it roughly like?

1:58:08.740 --> 1:58:11.460
 Is it roughly like a grid, a two dimensional grid?

1:58:11.460 --> 1:58:15.240
 Is it roughly like all those nodes are arranged online?

1:58:15.240 --> 1:58:16.740
 What's it roughly like?

1:58:16.740 --> 1:58:19.600
 And there's a pretty simple mathematical way

1:58:19.600 --> 1:58:23.960
 to estimate that by just looking at this thing

1:58:23.960 --> 1:58:26.340
 I was describing, this sort of the size of a ball

1:58:26.340 --> 1:58:28.240
 that you construct in the hypergraph.

1:58:28.240 --> 1:58:29.800
 That's a, you just measure that,

1:58:29.800 --> 1:58:33.000
 you can just compute it on a computer for a given hypergraph

1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:35.160
 and you can say, oh, this thing is wiggling around,

1:58:35.160 --> 1:58:38.240
 but it's roughly corresponds to two or something like that,

1:58:38.240 --> 1:58:41.440
 or roughly corresponds to 2.6 or whatever.

1:58:41.440 --> 1:58:44.080
 So that's how you have a notion of dimension

1:58:44.080 --> 1:58:45.640
 in these hypergraphs.

1:58:45.640 --> 1:58:48.600
 Curvature is something a little bit beyond that.

1:58:48.600 --> 1:58:52.120
 If you look at how the size of this ball increases

1:58:52.120 --> 1:58:53.960
 as you increase its radius,

1:58:53.960 --> 1:58:55.400
 curvature is a correction

1:58:55.400 --> 1:58:58.920
 to the size increase associated with dimension.

1:58:58.920 --> 1:59:01.120
 It's a sort of a second order term

1:59:01.120 --> 1:59:03.360
 in determining the size.

1:59:03.360 --> 1:59:07.000
 Just like the area of a circle is roughly pi R squared.

1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:08.520
 So it goes up like R squared.

1:59:08.520 --> 1:59:11.080
 The two is because it's in two dimensions,

1:59:11.080 --> 1:59:14.440
 but when that circle is drawn on a big sphere,

1:59:14.440 --> 1:59:18.320
 the actual formula is pi R squared times one minus

1:59:19.400 --> 1:59:22.640
 R squared over A squared and some coefficient.

1:59:22.640 --> 1:59:25.000
 So in other words, there's a correction to,

1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:28.240
 and that correction term, that gives you curvature.

1:59:28.240 --> 1:59:29.720
 And that correction term

1:59:29.720 --> 1:59:32.880
 is what makes this hypergraph correspond,

1:59:32.880 --> 1:59:35.840
 have the potential to correspond to curved space.

1:59:35.840 --> 1:59:38.480
 Now, the next question is, is that curvature,

1:59:38.480 --> 1:59:40.400
 is the way that curvature works

1:59:40.400 --> 1:59:43.800
 the way that Einstein's equations for general relativity,

1:59:43.800 --> 1:59:46.040
 is it the way they say it should work?

1:59:46.040 --> 1:59:49.160
 And the answer is yes.

1:59:49.160 --> 1:59:52.280
 And so how does that work?

1:59:54.560 --> 1:59:57.240
 The calculation of the curvature of this hypergraph

1:59:57.240 --> 1:59:59.760
 for some set of rules?

1:59:59.760 --> 2:00:01.800
 No, it doesn't matter what the rules are.

2:00:01.800 --> 2:00:03.360
 So long as they have causal invariance

2:00:03.360 --> 2:00:05.440
 and computational irreducibility,

2:00:05.440 --> 2:00:09.360
 and they lead to finite dimensional space,

2:00:09.360 --> 2:00:11.600
 noninfinite dimensional space.

2:00:11.600 --> 2:00:13.600
 Noninfinite dimensional.

2:00:13.600 --> 2:00:14.760
 It can grow infinitely,

2:00:14.760 --> 2:00:16.560
 but it can't be infinite dimensional.

2:00:16.560 --> 2:00:19.840
 So what is a infinitely dimensional hypergraph look like?

2:00:19.840 --> 2:00:22.600
 So that means, for example, so in a tree,

2:00:22.600 --> 2:00:25.400
 you start from one root of the tree,

2:00:25.400 --> 2:00:28.360
 it doubles, doubles again, doubles again, doubles again.

2:00:28.360 --> 2:00:30.720
 And that means if you ask the question,

2:00:30.720 --> 2:00:32.360
 starting from a given point,

2:00:32.360 --> 2:00:34.160
 how many points do you get to?

2:00:34.160 --> 2:00:35.360
 Remember, in like a circle,

2:00:35.360 --> 2:00:37.840
 you get to R squared, the two there.

2:00:37.840 --> 2:00:41.240
 On a tree, you get to, for example, two to the R.

2:00:41.240 --> 2:00:43.320
 It's exponential dimensional, so to speak,

2:00:43.320 --> 2:00:44.360
 or infinite dimensional.

2:00:44.360 --> 2:00:48.480
 Do you have a sense of, in the space of all possible rules,

2:00:48.480 --> 2:00:53.480
 how many lead to infinitely dimensional hypergraphs?

2:00:53.720 --> 2:00:55.280
 Is that? No.

2:00:55.280 --> 2:00:56.120
 Okay.

2:00:56.120 --> 2:00:57.920
 Is that an important thing to know?

2:00:57.920 --> 2:00:59.520
 Yes, it's an important thing to know.

2:00:59.520 --> 2:01:01.560
 I would love to know the answer to that.

2:01:01.560 --> 2:01:03.520
 But it gets a little bit more complicated

2:01:03.520 --> 2:01:05.720
 because, for example, it's very possibly the case

2:01:05.720 --> 2:01:07.440
 that in our physical universe,

2:01:07.440 --> 2:01:10.000
 that the universe started infinite dimensional.

2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:13.800
 And it only, as the Big Bang,

2:01:13.800 --> 2:01:16.080
 it was very likely infinite dimensional.

2:01:16.080 --> 2:01:21.080
 And as the universe sort of expanded and cooled,

2:01:21.280 --> 2:01:23.720
 its dimension gradually went down.

2:01:23.720 --> 2:01:25.400
 And so one of the bizarre possibilities,

2:01:25.400 --> 2:01:27.120
 which actually there are experiments you can do

2:01:27.120 --> 2:01:28.520
 to try and look at this,

2:01:28.520 --> 2:01:31.000
 the universe can have dimension fluctuations.

2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:31.840
 So in other words,

2:01:31.840 --> 2:01:33.400
 we think we live in a three dimensional universe,

2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:35.600
 but actually there may be places

2:01:35.600 --> 2:01:37.920
 where it's actually 3.01 dimensional,

2:01:37.920 --> 2:01:40.520
 or where it's 2.99 dimensional.

2:01:40.520 --> 2:01:43.320
 And it may be that in the very early universe,

2:01:43.320 --> 2:01:45.200
 it was actually infinite dimensional,

2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:47.200
 and it's only a late stage phenomenon

2:01:47.200 --> 2:01:49.240
 that we end up getting three dimensional space.

2:01:49.240 --> 2:01:51.920
 But from your perspective of the hypergraph,

2:01:51.920 --> 2:01:55.240
 one of the underlying assumptions you kind of implied,

2:01:55.240 --> 2:01:59.640
 but you have a sense, a hope set of assumptions

2:01:59.640 --> 2:02:03.120
 that the rules that underlie our universe,

2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:07.240
 or the rule that underlies our universe is static.

2:02:08.200 --> 2:02:10.160
 Is that one of the assumptions

2:02:10.160 --> 2:02:11.840
 you're currently operating under?

2:02:11.840 --> 2:02:14.840
 Yes, but there's a footnote to that,

2:02:14.840 --> 2:02:15.680
 which we should get to,

2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:17.560
 because it requires a few more steps.

2:02:17.560 --> 2:02:19.920
 Well, actually then, let's backtrack to the curvature,

2:02:19.920 --> 2:02:23.120
 because we're talking about as long as it's finite dimensional.

2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:28.000
 Finite dimensional computational irreducibility

2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:29.680
 and causal invariance,

2:02:29.680 --> 2:02:34.680
 then it follows that the large scale structure

2:02:35.800 --> 2:02:37.880
 will follow Einstein's equations.

2:02:37.880 --> 2:02:40.720
 And now let me again, qualify that a little bit more,

2:02:40.720 --> 2:02:43.120
 there's a little bit more complexity to it.

2:02:43.120 --> 2:02:48.120
 The, okay, so Einstein's equations in their simplest form

2:02:48.120 --> 2:02:51.720
 apply to the vacuum, no matter, just the vacuum.

2:02:51.720 --> 2:02:54.200
 And they say, in particular, what they say is,

2:02:54.200 --> 2:02:58.520
 if you have, so there's this term GD6,

2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:00.920
 that's a term that means shortest path,

2:03:00.920 --> 2:03:03.680
 comes from measuring the shortest paths on the Earth.

2:03:03.680 --> 2:03:07.600
 So you look at a bunch of, a bundle of GD6,

2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:09.520
 a bunch of shortest paths,

2:03:09.520 --> 2:03:11.040
 it's like the paths that photons

2:03:11.040 --> 2:03:13.040
 would take between two points.

2:03:13.040 --> 2:03:14.960
 Then the statement of Einstein's equations,

2:03:14.960 --> 2:03:18.040
 it's basically a statement about a certain the,

2:03:18.040 --> 2:03:20.360
 that as you look at a bundle of GD6,

2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:22.920
 the structure of space has to be such that,

2:03:22.920 --> 2:03:27.800
 although the cross sectional area of this bundle may,

2:03:27.800 --> 2:03:30.000
 although the actual shape of the cross section may change,

2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:31.800
 the cross sectional area does not.

2:03:31.800 --> 2:03:35.280
 That's a version, that's the most simple minded version

2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:38.960
 of R mu nu minus a half R G mu nu equals zero,

2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:41.040
 which is the more mathematical version

2:03:41.040 --> 2:03:42.440
 of Einstein's equations.

2:03:42.440 --> 2:03:45.360
 It's a statement of the thing called the Ritchie tensor

2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:46.840
 is equal to zero.

2:03:46.840 --> 2:03:50.080
 That's Einstein's equations for the vacuum.

2:03:50.080 --> 2:03:54.400
 Okay, so we get that as a result of this model,

2:03:54.400 --> 2:03:57.840
 but footnote, big footnote,

2:03:57.840 --> 2:04:00.280
 because all the matter in the universe

2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:01.680
 is the stuff we actually care about.

2:04:01.680 --> 2:04:03.560
 The vacuum is not stuff we care about.

2:04:03.560 --> 2:04:06.440
 So the question is, how does matter come into this?

2:04:06.440 --> 2:04:09.720
 And for that, you have to understand what energy is

2:04:09.720 --> 2:04:11.120
 in these models.

2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:15.280
 And one of the things that we realized, you know,

2:04:15.280 --> 2:04:20.280
 late last year was that there's a very simple interpretation

2:04:20.360 --> 2:04:22.560
 of energy in these models, okay?

2:04:22.560 --> 2:04:27.560
 And energy is basically, well, intuitively,

2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:32.720
 it's the amount of activity in these hypergraphs

2:04:32.720 --> 2:04:36.840
 and the way that that remains over time.

2:04:36.840 --> 2:04:38.640
 So a little bit more formally,

2:04:38.640 --> 2:04:41.560
 you can think about this causal graph

2:04:41.560 --> 2:04:44.880
 as having these edges that represent causal relationships.

2:04:44.880 --> 2:04:46.120
 You can think about, oh boy,

2:04:46.120 --> 2:04:47.920
 there's one more concept that we didn't get to.

2:04:47.920 --> 2:04:51.800
 It's the notion of space like hypersurfaces.

2:04:51.800 --> 2:04:55.800
 So this is not as scary as it sounds.

2:04:55.800 --> 2:04:59.720
 It's a common notion in general activity.

2:04:59.720 --> 2:05:04.720
 The notion is you are defining what is a possibly,

2:05:04.720 --> 2:05:09.720
 where in space time might be a particular moment in time.

2:05:13.960 --> 2:05:18.200
 So in other words, what is a consistent set of places

2:05:18.200 --> 2:05:21.760
 where you can say, this is happening now, so to speak.

2:05:21.760 --> 2:05:25.600
 And you make the series of sort of slices

2:05:25.600 --> 2:05:29.200
 through the space time, through this causal graph

2:05:29.200 --> 2:05:32.000
 to represent sort of what we consider

2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:34.680
 to be successive moments in time.

2:05:34.680 --> 2:05:37.720
 It's somewhat arbitrary because you can deform that

2:05:37.720 --> 2:05:39.880
 if you're going at a different speed in a special activity,

2:05:39.880 --> 2:05:44.520
 you tip those things, there are different kinds

2:05:44.520 --> 2:05:46.800
 of deformations, but only certain deformations

2:05:46.800 --> 2:05:48.400
 are allowed by the structure of the causal graph.

2:05:48.400 --> 2:05:52.360
 Anyway, be that as it may, the basic point is

2:05:52.360 --> 2:05:54.880
 there is a way of figuring out,

2:05:54.880 --> 2:05:57.120
 you say, what is the energy associated

2:05:57.120 --> 2:06:00.400
 with what's going on in this hypergraph?

2:06:00.400 --> 2:06:04.360
 And the answer is there is a precise definition of that.

2:06:04.360 --> 2:06:06.840
 And it is the formal way to say it is,

2:06:06.840 --> 2:06:08.560
 it's the flux of causal edges

2:06:08.560 --> 2:06:10.680
 through space like hypersurfaces.

2:06:10.680 --> 2:06:12.280
 The slightly less formal way to say it,

2:06:12.280 --> 2:06:14.480
 it's basically the amount of activity.

2:06:14.480 --> 2:06:18.000
 See, the reason it gets tricky is you might say

2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:21.000
 it's the amount of activity per unit volume

2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:25.280
 in this hypergraph, but you haven't defined what volume is.

2:06:25.280 --> 2:06:27.520
 So it's a little bit, you have to be a little more careful.

2:06:27.520 --> 2:06:30.600
 But this hypersurface gives some more formalism to that.

2:06:30.600 --> 2:06:32.840
 Yeah, yeah, it gives a way to connect that.

2:06:32.840 --> 2:06:36.400
 But intuitive, we should think about as the just activity.

2:06:36.400 --> 2:06:39.640
 Right, so the amount of activity that kind of remains

2:06:39.640 --> 2:06:42.800
 in one place in the hypergraph corresponds to energy.

2:06:42.800 --> 2:06:45.800
 The amount of activity that is kind of where an activity here

2:06:45.800 --> 2:06:48.160
 affects an activity somewhere else,

2:06:48.160 --> 2:06:50.480
 corresponds to momentum.

2:06:50.480 --> 2:06:53.840
 And so one of the things that's kind of cool

2:06:53.840 --> 2:06:55.600
 is that I'm trying to think about

2:06:55.600 --> 2:06:56.680
 how to say this intuitively.

2:06:56.680 --> 2:06:57.720
 The mathematics is easy,

2:06:57.720 --> 2:06:59.800
 but the intuitive version, I'm not sure.

2:06:59.800 --> 2:07:01.640
 But basically the way that things sort of stay

2:07:01.640 --> 2:07:03.960
 in the same place and have activity

2:07:03.960 --> 2:07:05.920
 is associated with rest mass.

2:07:05.920 --> 2:07:08.080
 And so one of the things that you get to derive

2:07:08.080 --> 2:07:09.880
 is E equals MC squared.

2:07:10.800 --> 2:07:14.840
 That is a consequence of this interpretation of energy

2:07:14.840 --> 2:07:18.040
 in terms of the way the causal graph works,

2:07:18.040 --> 2:07:20.160
 which is the whole thing is sort of a consequence

2:07:20.160 --> 2:07:23.720
 of this whole story about updates and hypergraphs and so on.

2:07:23.720 --> 2:07:26.280
 So can you linger on that a little bit?

2:07:26.280 --> 2:07:28.840
 How do we get E equals MC squared?

2:07:28.840 --> 2:07:31.280
 So where does the mass come from?

2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:32.240
 Okay, okay.

2:07:32.240 --> 2:07:35.000
 I mean, is there an intuitive, it's okay.

2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:37.720
 First of all, you're pretty deep

2:07:37.720 --> 2:07:41.600
 in the mathematical explorations of this thing right now.

2:07:41.600 --> 2:07:45.920
 We're in a very, we're in a flux currently.

2:07:45.920 --> 2:07:47.960
 So maybe you haven't even had time

2:07:47.960 --> 2:07:51.680
 to think about intuitive explanations, but.

2:07:51.680 --> 2:07:56.320
 Yeah, I mean, this one is, look, roughly what's happening,

2:07:56.320 --> 2:07:58.400
 that derivation is actually rather easy.

2:07:58.400 --> 2:07:59.840
 And everybody, and I've been saying

2:07:59.840 --> 2:08:01.600
 we should pay more attention to this derivation

2:08:01.600 --> 2:08:02.480
 because it's such, you know,

2:08:02.480 --> 2:08:04.320
 cause people care about this one.

2:08:04.320 --> 2:08:05.880
 But everybody says, it's just easy.

2:08:05.880 --> 2:08:07.200
 It's easy.

2:08:07.200 --> 2:08:09.320
 So there's some concept of energy

2:08:09.320 --> 2:08:12.880
 that can be intuitively thought of as the activity,

2:08:12.880 --> 2:08:16.760
 the flux, the level of changes that are occurring

2:08:16.760 --> 2:08:19.400
 based on the transformations within a certain volume,

2:08:19.400 --> 2:08:21.240
 however the heck do you find the volume.

2:08:21.240 --> 2:08:23.560
 Okay, so, and then mass.

2:08:23.560 --> 2:08:28.560
 Well, mass is associated with kind of the energy

2:08:28.560 --> 2:08:30.440
 that does not cause you to,

2:08:30.440 --> 2:08:34.000
 that does not somehow propagate through time.

2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:35.960
 Yeah, I mean, one of the things that was not obvious

2:08:35.960 --> 2:08:38.400
 in the usual formulation of special relativity

2:08:38.400 --> 2:08:42.800
 is that space and time are connected in a certain way.

2:08:42.800 --> 2:08:46.280
 Energy and momentum are also connected in a certain way.

2:08:46.280 --> 2:08:49.080
 The fact that the connection of energy to momentum

2:08:49.080 --> 2:08:50.800
 is analogous to the connection to space

2:08:50.800 --> 2:08:52.400
 between space and time

2:08:52.400 --> 2:08:54.920
 is not self evident in ordinary relativity.

2:08:54.920 --> 2:08:58.360
 It is a consequence of this, of the way this model works.

2:08:58.360 --> 2:09:00.960
 It's an intrinsic consequence of the way this model works.

2:09:00.960 --> 2:09:02.800
 And it's all to do with that,

2:09:02.800 --> 2:09:05.240
 with unraveling that connection

2:09:05.240 --> 2:09:07.720
 that ends up giving you this relationship

2:09:07.720 --> 2:09:12.480
 between energy and, well, it's energy, momentum, mass,

2:09:12.480 --> 2:09:13.760
 they're all connected.

2:09:13.760 --> 2:09:18.760
 And so like, that's hence the general relativity.

2:09:19.560 --> 2:09:24.560
 You have a sense that it appears to be baked in

2:09:24.600 --> 2:09:27.000
 to the fundamental properties

2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:29.320
 of the way these hypergraphs are evolved.

2:09:29.320 --> 2:09:30.360
 Well, I didn't yet get to,

2:09:30.360 --> 2:09:33.680
 so I got as far as special relativity and equals MC squared.

2:09:33.680 --> 2:09:37.320
 The one last step is, in general relativity,

2:09:37.320 --> 2:09:41.800
 the final connection is energy and mass

2:09:41.800 --> 2:09:44.440
 cause curvature in space.

2:09:44.440 --> 2:09:47.720
 And that's something that when you understand

2:09:47.720 --> 2:09:49.760
 this interpretation of energy,

2:09:49.760 --> 2:09:52.080
 and you kind of understand the correspondence

2:09:52.080 --> 2:09:54.000
 to curvature and hypergraphs,

2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:57.640
 then you can finally sort of, the big final answer is,

2:09:57.640 --> 2:10:00.440
 you derive the full version of Einstein's equations

2:10:00.440 --> 2:10:03.320
 for space, time and matter.

2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:04.480
 And that's some.

2:10:04.480 --> 2:10:09.480
 Is that, have you, that last piece with curvature,

2:10:09.520 --> 2:10:12.320
 have, is that, have you arrived there yet?

2:10:12.320 --> 2:10:13.760
 Oh yeah, we're there, yes.

2:10:13.760 --> 2:10:15.480
 And here's the way that we,

2:10:15.480 --> 2:10:17.200
 here's how we're really, really going to know

2:10:17.200 --> 2:10:18.480
 we've arrived, okay?

2:10:18.480 --> 2:10:20.720
 So, you know, we have the mathematical derivation,

2:10:20.720 --> 2:10:22.720
 it's all fine, but, you know,

2:10:22.720 --> 2:10:25.000
 mathematical derivations, okay.

2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:27.720
 So one thing that's sort of a,

2:10:27.720 --> 2:10:29.240
 you know, we're taking this limit

2:10:29.240 --> 2:10:31.160
 of what happens when you, the limit,

2:10:31.160 --> 2:10:32.920
 you have to look at things which are large

2:10:32.920 --> 2:10:35.240
 compared to the size of an elementary length,

2:10:35.240 --> 2:10:37.440
 small compared to the whole size of the universe,

2:10:37.440 --> 2:10:40.480
 large compared to certain kinds of fluctuations,

2:10:40.480 --> 2:10:41.600
 blah, blah, blah.

2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:43.360
 There's a, there's a, there's a tower

2:10:43.360 --> 2:10:45.160
 of many, many of these mathematical limits

2:10:45.160 --> 2:10:46.440
 that have to be taken.

2:10:46.440 --> 2:10:48.720
 So if you're a pure mathematician saying,

2:10:48.720 --> 2:10:50.520
 where's the precise proof?

2:10:50.520 --> 2:10:52.480
 It's like, well, there are all these limits,

2:10:52.480 --> 2:10:54.880
 we can, you know, we can try each one of them

2:10:54.880 --> 2:10:57.520
 computationally and we could say, yeah, it really works,

2:10:57.520 --> 2:11:00.560
 but the formal mathematics is really hard to do.

2:11:00.560 --> 2:11:03.120
 I mean, for example, in the case of deriving

2:11:03.120 --> 2:11:06.200
 the equations of fluid dynamics from molecular dynamics,

2:11:06.200 --> 2:11:08.040
 that derivation has never been done.

2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:11.360
 There is no rigorous version of that derivation.

2:11:11.360 --> 2:11:12.200
 So, so that could be.

2:11:12.200 --> 2:11:13.760
 Because you can't do the limits?

2:11:13.760 --> 2:11:15.920
 Yeah, because you can't do the limits.

2:11:15.920 --> 2:11:18.320
 But so the limits allow you to try to describe

2:11:18.320 --> 2:11:20.280
 something general about the system

2:11:20.280 --> 2:11:22.520
 and very, very particular kinds of limits that you need

2:11:22.520 --> 2:11:23.640
 to take with these very.

2:11:23.640 --> 2:11:26.000
 Right, and the limits will definitely work

2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:27.200
 the way we think they work.

2:11:27.200 --> 2:11:28.760
 And we can do all kinds of computer experiments.

2:11:28.760 --> 2:11:29.760
 It's just a hard derivation.

2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:32.760
 Yeah, it's just, it's just the mathematical structure

2:11:32.760 --> 2:11:35.240
 kind of, you know, ends up running right into

2:11:35.240 --> 2:11:37.080
 computational irreducibility.

2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:39.560
 And you end up with a bunch of, a bunch of difficulty there.

2:11:39.560 --> 2:11:42.320
 But here's the way that we're getting really confident

2:11:42.320 --> 2:11:43.960
 that we know completely what we're talking about,

2:11:43.960 --> 2:11:47.880
 which is when people study things like black hole mergers,

2:11:47.880 --> 2:11:51.000
 using Einstein's equations, what do they actually do?

2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:52.800
 Well, they actually use Mathematica or a whole bunch

2:11:52.800 --> 2:11:54.440
 to analyze the equations and so on.

2:11:54.440 --> 2:11:57.360
 But in the end, they do numerical relativity,

2:11:57.360 --> 2:12:01.440
 which means they take these nice mathematical equations

2:12:01.440 --> 2:12:03.280
 and they break them down so that they can run them

2:12:03.280 --> 2:12:04.360
 on a computer.

2:12:04.360 --> 2:12:05.920
 And they break them down into something

2:12:05.920 --> 2:12:07.680
 which is actually a discrete approximation

2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:08.920
 to these equations.

2:12:08.920 --> 2:12:11.560
 Then they run them on a computer, they get results.

2:12:11.560 --> 2:12:12.880
 Then you look at the gravitational waves

2:12:12.880 --> 2:12:14.840
 and you see if they match, okay?

2:12:14.840 --> 2:12:18.240
 It turns out that our model gives you a direct way

2:12:18.240 --> 2:12:19.800
 to do numerical relativity.

2:12:19.800 --> 2:12:21.120
 So in other words, instead of saying,

2:12:21.120 --> 2:12:23.960
 you start from these continuum equations from Einstein,

2:12:23.960 --> 2:12:26.280
 you break them down into these discrete things,

2:12:26.280 --> 2:12:27.600
 you run them on a computer,

2:12:27.600 --> 2:12:28.920
 you say, we're doing it the other way around.

2:12:28.920 --> 2:12:30.680
 We're starting from these discrete things

2:12:30.680 --> 2:12:31.880
 that come from our model.

2:12:31.880 --> 2:12:34.520
 And we're just running big versions on the computer.

2:12:34.520 --> 2:12:37.080
 And, you know, what we're saying is,

2:12:37.080 --> 2:12:39.560
 and this is how things will work.

2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:43.760
 So the way I'm calling this is proof by compilation,

2:12:43.760 --> 2:12:46.480
 so to speak, that is, in other words,

2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:49.320
 you're taking something where, you know,

2:12:49.320 --> 2:12:52.320
 we've got this description of a black hole system.

2:12:52.320 --> 2:12:56.120
 And what we're doing is we're showing that the, you know,

2:12:56.120 --> 2:12:59.320
 what we get by just running our model agrees

2:12:59.320 --> 2:13:02.720
 with what you would get by doing the computation

2:13:02.720 --> 2:13:04.320
 from the Einstein equations.

2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:08.360
 As a small tangent or actually a very big tangent,

2:13:08.360 --> 2:13:13.360
 but proof by compilation is a beautiful concept.

2:13:15.200 --> 2:13:20.200
 In a sense, the way of doing physics with this model

2:13:21.400 --> 2:13:26.040
 is by running it or compiling it.

2:13:26.040 --> 2:13:29.800
 And have you thought about,

2:13:29.800 --> 2:13:32.000
 and these things can be very large,

2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:37.000
 is there a totally new possibilities of computing hardware

2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:38.960
 and computing software,

2:13:38.960 --> 2:13:42.200
 which allows you to perform this kind of compilation?

2:13:42.200 --> 2:13:44.920
 Well, algorithms, software, hardware.

2:13:44.920 --> 2:13:49.440
 So first comment is these models seem to give one

2:13:49.440 --> 2:13:52.480
 a lot of intuition about distributed computing,

2:13:52.480 --> 2:13:54.680
 a lot of different intuition about how to think

2:13:54.680 --> 2:13:56.640
 about parallel computation.

2:13:56.640 --> 2:13:58.960
 And that particularly comes from the quantum mechanics

2:13:58.960 --> 2:14:01.880
 side of things, which we didn't talk about much yet.

2:14:01.880 --> 2:14:04.720
 But the question of what, you know,

2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:07.760
 given our current computer hardware,

2:14:07.760 --> 2:14:10.120
 how can we most efficiently simulate things?

2:14:10.120 --> 2:14:12.920
 That's actually partly a story of the model itself,

2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:16.160
 because the model itself has deep parallelism in it.

2:14:16.160 --> 2:14:17.760
 The ways that we are simulating it,

2:14:17.760 --> 2:14:21.080
 we're just starting to be able to use that deep parallelism

2:14:21.080 --> 2:14:22.600
 to be able to be more efficient

2:14:22.600 --> 2:14:24.400
 in the way that we simulate things.

2:14:24.400 --> 2:14:27.880
 But in fact, the structure of the model itself

2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:30.280
 allows us to think about parallel computation

2:14:30.280 --> 2:14:31.520
 in different ways.

2:14:31.520 --> 2:14:34.600
 And one of my realizations is that, you know,

2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:37.000
 so it's very hard to get in your brain

2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:38.520
 how you deal with parallel computation.

2:14:38.520 --> 2:14:40.240
 And you're always worrying about, you know,

2:14:40.240 --> 2:14:42.720
 if multiple things can happen on different computers

2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:44.640
 at different times, oh, what happens

2:14:44.640 --> 2:14:46.440
 if this thing happens before that thing?

2:14:46.440 --> 2:14:47.520
 And we've really got, you know,

2:14:47.520 --> 2:14:49.720
 we have these race conditions where something can race

2:14:49.720 --> 2:14:51.800
 to get to the answer before another thing.

2:14:51.800 --> 2:14:54.040
 And you get all tangled up because you don't know

2:14:54.040 --> 2:14:55.960
 which thing is gonna come in first.

2:14:55.960 --> 2:14:58.320
 And usually when you do parallel computing,

2:14:58.320 --> 2:15:00.480
 there's a big obsession to lock things down

2:15:00.480 --> 2:15:03.920
 to the point where you've had locks and mutexes

2:15:03.920 --> 2:15:05.240
 and God knows what else,

2:15:05.240 --> 2:15:09.600
 where you've arranged it so that there can only be

2:15:09.600 --> 2:15:11.560
 one sequence of things that can happen.

2:15:11.560 --> 2:15:12.640
 So you don't have to think about

2:15:12.640 --> 2:15:14.760
 all the different kinds of things that can happen.

2:15:14.760 --> 2:15:18.200
 Well, in these models, physics is throwing us into,

2:15:18.200 --> 2:15:20.240
 forcing us to think about all these possible things

2:15:20.240 --> 2:15:21.240
 that can happen.

2:15:21.240 --> 2:15:24.640
 But these models together with what we know from physics

2:15:24.640 --> 2:15:26.520
 is giving us new ways to think about

2:15:26.520 --> 2:15:28.560
 all possible things happening,

2:15:28.560 --> 2:15:30.680
 about all these different things happening in parallel.

2:15:30.680 --> 2:15:31.680
 And so I'm guessing...

2:15:31.680 --> 2:15:34.640
 They have built in protection for some of the parallelism.

2:15:34.640 --> 2:15:37.280
 Well, causal invariance is the built in protection.

2:15:37.280 --> 2:15:39.720
 Causal invariance is what means that

2:15:39.720 --> 2:15:41.680
 even though things happen in different orders,

2:15:41.680 --> 2:15:43.440
 it doesn't matter in the end.

2:15:43.440 --> 2:15:46.520
 As a person who struggled with concurrent programming

2:15:46.520 --> 2:15:50.240
 in like Java,

2:15:50.240 --> 2:15:53.760
 with all the basic concepts of concurrent programming,

2:15:53.760 --> 2:15:55.760
 that if there could be built up

2:15:55.760 --> 2:16:00.080
 a strong mathematical framework for causal invariance,

2:16:00.080 --> 2:16:01.760
 that's so liberating.

2:16:01.760 --> 2:16:03.680
 And that could be not just liberating,

2:16:03.680 --> 2:16:08.320
 but really powerful for massively distributed computation.

2:16:08.320 --> 2:16:09.160
 Absolutely.

2:16:09.160 --> 2:16:11.800
 No, I mean, what's eventual consistency

2:16:11.800 --> 2:16:14.000
 in distributed databases

2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:16.160
 is essentially the causal invariance idea.

2:16:16.160 --> 2:16:17.000
 Yeah. Okay.

2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:17.840
 So that's...

2:16:17.840 --> 2:16:19.760
 But have you thought about,

2:16:22.160 --> 2:16:26.000
 like really large simulations?

2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:28.080
 Yeah. I mean, I'm also thinking about,

2:16:28.080 --> 2:16:30.400
 look, the fact is I've spent much of my life

2:16:30.400 --> 2:16:31.640
 as a language designer, right?

2:16:31.640 --> 2:16:34.360
 So I can't possibly not think about,

2:16:34.360 --> 2:16:37.240
 what does this mean for designing languages

2:16:37.240 --> 2:16:38.320
 for parallel computation?

2:16:38.320 --> 2:16:41.640
 In fact, another thing that's one of these...

2:16:41.640 --> 2:16:44.400
 I'm always embarrassed at how long it's taken me

2:16:44.400 --> 2:16:45.680
 to figure stuff out.

2:16:45.680 --> 2:16:47.360
 But back in the 1980s,

2:16:47.360 --> 2:16:49.600
 I worked on trying to make up languages

2:16:49.600 --> 2:16:50.960
 for parallel computation.

2:16:50.960 --> 2:16:53.080
 I thought about doing graph rewriting.

2:16:53.080 --> 2:16:54.440
 I thought about doing these kinds of things,

2:16:54.440 --> 2:16:57.160
 but I couldn't see how to actually make the connections

2:16:57.160 --> 2:16:59.320
 to actually do something useful.

2:16:59.320 --> 2:17:02.520
 I think now physics is kind of showing us

2:17:02.520 --> 2:17:04.200
 how to make those things useful.

2:17:04.200 --> 2:17:06.320
 And so my guess is that in time,

2:17:06.320 --> 2:17:09.000
 we'll be talking about, we do parallel programming.

2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:10.360
 We'll be talking about programming

2:17:10.360 --> 2:17:12.080
 in a certain reference frame,

2:17:12.080 --> 2:17:14.120
 just as we think about thinking about physics

2:17:14.120 --> 2:17:15.080
 in a certain reference frame.

2:17:15.080 --> 2:17:17.640
 It's a certain coordination of what's going on.

2:17:17.640 --> 2:17:19.960
 We say, we're gonna program in this reference frame.

2:17:19.960 --> 2:17:21.280
 Oh, let's change the reference frame

2:17:21.280 --> 2:17:22.680
 to this reference frame.

2:17:22.680 --> 2:17:25.240
 And then our program will seem different

2:17:25.240 --> 2:17:27.120
 and we'll have a different way to think about it.

2:17:27.120 --> 2:17:28.960
 But it's still the same program underneath.

2:17:28.960 --> 2:17:30.760
 So let me ask on this topic,

2:17:30.760 --> 2:17:32.360
 cause I put out that I'm talking to you.

2:17:32.360 --> 2:17:34.560
 I got way more questions than I can deal with,

2:17:34.560 --> 2:17:37.520
 but what pops to mind is a question somebody asked

2:17:37.520 --> 2:17:42.520
 on Reddit I think is, please ask Dr. Wolfram,

2:17:42.560 --> 2:17:46.200
 what are the specs of the computer running the universe?

2:17:46.200 --> 2:17:51.200
 So we're talking about specs of hardware and software

2:17:51.480 --> 2:17:54.080
 for simulations of a large scale thing.

2:17:54.080 --> 2:17:57.520
 What about a scale that is comparative

2:17:57.520 --> 2:17:59.720
 to something that eventually leads

2:17:59.720 --> 2:18:01.560
 to the two of us talking and about?

2:18:01.560 --> 2:18:02.400
 Right, right, right.

2:18:02.400 --> 2:18:05.080
 So actually I did try to estimate that.

2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:07.280
 And we actually have to go a couple more stages

2:18:07.280 --> 2:18:08.680
 before we can really get to that answer

2:18:08.680 --> 2:18:13.680
 because we're talking about this thing.

2:18:14.200 --> 2:18:16.920
 This is what happens when you build these abstract systems

2:18:16.920 --> 2:18:19.560
 and you're trying to explain the universe,

2:18:19.560 --> 2:18:23.640
 they're quite a number of levels deep, so to speak.

2:18:23.640 --> 2:18:25.520
 But the...

2:18:25.520 --> 2:18:27.280
 You mean conceptually or like literally?

2:18:27.280 --> 2:18:28.800
 Cause you're talking about small objects

2:18:28.800 --> 2:18:31.600
 and there's 10 to the 120 something.

2:18:31.600 --> 2:18:32.440
 Yeah, right.

2:18:33.840 --> 2:18:35.120
 It is conceptually deep.

2:18:35.120 --> 2:18:37.920
 And one of the things that's happening sort of structurally

2:18:37.920 --> 2:18:40.600
 in this project is, you know, there were ideas,

2:18:40.600 --> 2:18:41.760
 there's another layer of ideas,

2:18:41.760 --> 2:18:43.240
 there's another layer of ideas

2:18:43.240 --> 2:18:46.960
 to get to the different things that correspond to physics.

2:18:46.960 --> 2:18:49.280
 They're just different layers of ideas.

2:18:49.280 --> 2:18:52.360
 And they are, you know, it's actually probably,

2:18:52.360 --> 2:18:54.480
 if anything, getting harder to explain this project

2:18:54.480 --> 2:18:56.520
 cause I'm realizing that the fraction of way through

2:18:56.520 --> 2:18:59.760
 that I am so far and explaining this to you is less than,

2:18:59.760 --> 2:19:02.840
 than, you know, it might be because we know more now,

2:19:02.840 --> 2:19:06.200
 you know, every week basically we know a little bit more.

2:19:06.200 --> 2:19:07.040
 And like...

2:19:07.040 --> 2:19:10.480
 Those are just layers on the initial fundamental structure.

2:19:10.480 --> 2:19:12.640
 Yes, but the layers are, you know,

2:19:12.640 --> 2:19:14.320
 you might be asking me, you know,

2:19:14.320 --> 2:19:18.680
 how do we get the difference between fermions and bosons,

2:19:18.680 --> 2:19:19.880
 the difference between particles

2:19:19.880 --> 2:19:21.760
 that can be all in the same state

2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:24.080
 and particles that exclude each other, okay.

2:19:24.080 --> 2:19:26.600
 Last three days, we've kind of figured that out.

2:19:26.600 --> 2:19:27.440
 Okay.

2:19:27.440 --> 2:19:29.440
 But, and it's very interesting.

2:19:29.440 --> 2:19:31.080
 It's very cool.

2:19:31.080 --> 2:19:32.040
 And it's very...

2:19:32.040 --> 2:19:35.800
 And those are some kind of properties at a certain level,

2:19:35.800 --> 2:19:37.880
 layer of abstraction on the graph.

2:19:37.880 --> 2:19:38.720
 Yes, yes.

2:19:38.720 --> 2:19:41.640
 And there's, but the layers of abstraction are kind of,

2:19:41.640 --> 2:19:42.760
 they're compounding.

2:19:42.760 --> 2:19:43.600
 Stacking up.

2:19:43.600 --> 2:19:45.320
 So it's difficult, but...

2:19:45.320 --> 2:19:46.160
 But okay.

2:19:46.160 --> 2:19:47.920
 But the specs nevertheless remain the same.

2:19:47.920 --> 2:19:49.560
 Okay, the specs underneath.

2:19:49.560 --> 2:19:50.960
 So I have an estimate.

2:19:50.960 --> 2:19:52.440
 So the question is, what are the units?

2:19:52.440 --> 2:19:54.840
 So we've got these different fundamental constants

2:19:54.840 --> 2:19:56.160
 about the world.

2:19:56.160 --> 2:19:58.520
 So one of them is the speed of light, which is the...

2:19:58.520 --> 2:20:00.200
 So the thing that's always the same

2:20:00.200 --> 2:20:02.720
 in all these different ways of thinking about the universe

2:20:02.720 --> 2:20:06.200
 is the notion of time, because time is computation.

2:20:06.200 --> 2:20:08.080
 And so there's an elementary time,

2:20:08.080 --> 2:20:12.240
 which is sort of the amount of time that we ascribe

2:20:12.240 --> 2:20:16.160
 to elapsing in a single computational step.

2:20:16.160 --> 2:20:17.000
 Yeah.

2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:17.840
 Okay.

2:20:17.840 --> 2:20:18.680
 So that's the elementary time.

2:20:18.680 --> 2:20:19.520
 So then there's an elementary...

2:20:19.520 --> 2:20:20.440
 That's a parameter or whatever.

2:20:20.440 --> 2:20:21.880
 That's a constant.

2:20:21.880 --> 2:20:23.360
 It's whatever we define it to be,

2:20:23.360 --> 2:20:25.360
 because I mean, we don't, you know...

2:20:25.360 --> 2:20:26.840
 I mean, it's all relative, right?

2:20:26.840 --> 2:20:27.680
 It doesn't matter.

2:20:27.680 --> 2:20:28.520
 Yes, it doesn't matter what it is,

2:20:28.520 --> 2:20:30.360
 because we could be, it could be slower.

2:20:30.360 --> 2:20:33.840
 It's just a number which we use to convert that

2:20:33.840 --> 2:20:35.000
 to seconds, so to speak,

2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:37.160
 because we are experiencing things

2:20:37.160 --> 2:20:39.880
 and we say this amount of time has elapsed, so to speak.

2:20:39.880 --> 2:20:41.400
 But we're within this thing.

2:20:41.400 --> 2:20:42.240
 Absolutely.

2:20:42.240 --> 2:20:43.680
 So it doesn't matter, right?

2:20:43.680 --> 2:20:46.000
 But what does matter is the ratio,

2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:49.520
 what we can, the ratio of the spatial distance

2:20:49.520 --> 2:20:54.320
 and this hypergraph to this moment of time.

2:20:54.320 --> 2:20:55.800
 Again, that's an arbitrary thing,

2:20:55.800 --> 2:20:58.720
 but we measure that in meters per second, for example,

2:20:58.720 --> 2:21:00.880
 and that ratio is the speed of light.

2:21:00.880 --> 2:21:03.160
 So the ratio of the elementary distance

2:21:03.160 --> 2:21:06.640
 to the elementary time is the speed of light, okay?

2:21:06.640 --> 2:21:07.480
 Perfect.

2:21:07.480 --> 2:21:08.320
 And so there's another,

2:21:08.320 --> 2:21:11.360
 there are two other levels of this, okay?

2:21:11.360 --> 2:21:13.880
 So there is a thing which we can talk about,

2:21:13.880 --> 2:21:16.520
 which is the maximum entanglement speed,

2:21:16.520 --> 2:21:19.320
 which is a thing that happens at another level

2:21:19.320 --> 2:21:20.680
 in this whole sort of story

2:21:20.680 --> 2:21:22.840
 of how these things get constructed.

2:21:22.840 --> 2:21:24.840
 That's a sort of maximum speed in quantum,

2:21:24.840 --> 2:21:26.920
 in the space of quantum states.

2:21:26.920 --> 2:21:28.040
 Just as the speed of light

2:21:28.040 --> 2:21:30.200
 is a maximum speed in physical space,

2:21:30.200 --> 2:21:32.680
 this is a maximum speed in the space of quantum states.

2:21:32.680 --> 2:21:35.000
 There's another level which is associated

2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:36.600
 with what we call ruleal space,

2:21:36.600 --> 2:21:39.120
 which is another one of these maximum speeds.

2:21:39.120 --> 2:21:40.360
 We'll get to this.

2:21:40.360 --> 2:21:42.120
 So these are limitations on the system

2:21:42.120 --> 2:21:45.280
 that are able to capture the kind of physical universe

2:21:45.280 --> 2:21:46.280
 which we live in.

2:21:46.280 --> 2:21:47.120
 The quantum mechanical.

2:21:47.120 --> 2:21:51.800
 There are inevitable features of having a rule

2:21:51.800 --> 2:21:54.600
 that has only a finite amount of information in the rule.

2:21:54.600 --> 2:21:57.280
 So long as you have a rule that only involves

2:21:57.280 --> 2:22:01.560
 a bounded amount, a limited amount of,

2:22:01.560 --> 2:22:03.280
 only involving a limited number of elements,

2:22:03.280 --> 2:22:04.760
 limited number of relations,

2:22:04.760 --> 2:22:07.320
 it is inevitable that there are these speed constraints.

2:22:07.320 --> 2:22:08.800
 We knew about the one for speed of light.

2:22:08.800 --> 2:22:11.440
 We didn't know about the one for maximum entanglement speed,

2:22:11.440 --> 2:22:14.040
 which is actually something that is possibly measurable,

2:22:14.040 --> 2:22:17.000
 particularly in black hole systems and things like this.

2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:19.600
 Anyway, this is long, long story short.

2:22:19.600 --> 2:22:23.120
 You're asking what the processing specs of the universe,

2:22:23.120 --> 2:22:25.120
 of the sort of computation of the universe.

2:22:25.120 --> 2:22:27.400
 There's a question of even what are the units

2:22:27.400 --> 2:22:29.000
 of some of these measurements, okay?

2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:31.960
 So the units I'm using are Wolfram language instructions

2:22:31.960 --> 2:22:33.280
 per second, okay?

2:22:33.280 --> 2:22:34.840
 Because you gotta have some,

2:22:34.840 --> 2:22:37.000
 what computation are you doing?

2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:38.360
 There gotta be some kind of frame of reference.

2:22:38.360 --> 2:22:39.200
 Right, right.

2:22:39.200 --> 2:22:41.800
 So, because it turns out in the end,

2:22:41.800 --> 2:22:44.240
 there will be, there's sort of an arbitrariness

2:22:44.240 --> 2:22:46.960
 in the language that you use to describe the universe.

2:22:46.960 --> 2:22:51.600
 So in those terms, I think it's like 10 to the 500,

2:22:51.600 --> 2:22:54.320
 Wolfram language operations per second, I think,

2:22:54.320 --> 2:22:56.480
 is the, I think it's of that order.

2:22:56.480 --> 2:22:57.320
 You know, basically.

2:22:57.320 --> 2:22:58.760
 So that's the scale of the computation.

2:22:58.760 --> 2:22:59.920
 What about memory?

2:22:59.920 --> 2:23:01.360
 If there's an interesting thing to say

2:23:01.360 --> 2:23:02.720
 about storage and memory.

2:23:02.720 --> 2:23:04.360
 Well, there's a question of how many sort of atoms

2:23:04.360 --> 2:23:06.280
 of space might there be?

2:23:06.280 --> 2:23:08.680
 You know, maybe 10 to the 400.

2:23:08.680 --> 2:23:11.320
 We don't know exactly how to estimate these numbers.

2:23:11.320 --> 2:23:14.680
 I mean, this is based on some, I would say,

2:23:14.680 --> 2:23:17.960
 somewhat rickety way of estimating things.

2:23:17.960 --> 2:23:20.240
 You know, when there start to be able to be experiments done,

2:23:20.240 --> 2:23:21.840
 if we're lucky, there will be experiments

2:23:21.840 --> 2:23:24.160
 that can actually nail down some of these numbers.

2:23:24.160 --> 2:23:27.920
 And because of computation reducibility,

2:23:27.920 --> 2:23:31.520
 there's not much hope for very efficient compression,

2:23:31.520 --> 2:23:34.080
 like very efficient representation

2:23:34.080 --> 2:23:35.680
 of this atom space? Good question.

2:23:35.680 --> 2:23:37.960
 I mean, there's probably certain things, you know,

2:23:37.960 --> 2:23:40.560
 the fact that we can deduce anything,

2:23:40.560 --> 2:23:44.560
 okay, the question is how deep does the reducibility go?

2:23:44.560 --> 2:23:45.400
 Right. Okay.

2:23:45.400 --> 2:23:46.600
 And I keep on being surprised

2:23:46.600 --> 2:23:48.560
 that it's a lot deeper than I thought.

2:23:48.560 --> 2:23:52.120
 Okay, and so one of the things is that,

2:23:52.120 --> 2:23:53.840
 that there's a question of sort of how much

2:23:53.840 --> 2:23:57.480
 of the whole of physics do we have to be able to get

2:23:57.480 --> 2:23:59.280
 in order to explain certain kinds of phenomena?

2:23:59.280 --> 2:24:02.840
 Like for example, if we want to study quantum interference,

2:24:02.840 --> 2:24:05.800
 do we have to know what an electron is?

2:24:05.800 --> 2:24:08.480
 Turns out I thought we did, turns out we don't.

2:24:08.480 --> 2:24:10.400
 I thought to know what energy is,

2:24:10.400 --> 2:24:12.320
 we would have to know what electrons were.

2:24:12.320 --> 2:24:13.160
 We don't.

2:24:13.160 --> 2:24:15.560
 So you get a lot of really powerful shortcuts.

2:24:15.560 --> 2:24:16.400
 Right.

2:24:16.400 --> 2:24:19.240
 There's a bunch of sort of bulk information about the world.

2:24:19.240 --> 2:24:22.960
 The thing that I'm excited about last few days, okay,

2:24:22.960 --> 2:24:27.560
 is the idea of fermions versus bosons, fundamental idea

2:24:27.560 --> 2:24:29.800
 that I mean, it's the reason we have matter

2:24:29.800 --> 2:24:31.920
 that doesn't just self destruct,

2:24:31.920 --> 2:24:33.800
 is because of the exclusion principle

2:24:33.800 --> 2:24:36.360
 that means that two electrons can never be

2:24:36.360 --> 2:24:38.280
 in the same quantum state.

2:24:38.280 --> 2:24:41.000
 Is it useful for us to maybe first talk

2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:44.240
 about how quantum mechanics fits

2:24:44.240 --> 2:24:46.480
 into the Wolfram physics model?

2:24:46.480 --> 2:24:47.320
 Yes.

2:24:47.320 --> 2:24:48.160
 Let's go there.

2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:49.680
 So we talked about general relativity.

2:24:49.680 --> 2:24:54.680
 Now, what have you found from quantum mechanics

2:24:56.960 --> 2:24:59.920
 within and outside of the Wolfram physics?

2:24:59.920 --> 2:25:04.200
 Right, so I mean, the key idea of quantum mechanics

2:25:04.200 --> 2:25:06.600
 that sort of the typical interpretation

2:25:06.600 --> 2:25:09.960
 is classical physics says a definite thing happens.

2:25:09.960 --> 2:25:12.880
 Quantum physics says there's this whole set of paths

2:25:12.880 --> 2:25:14.600
 of things that might happen.

2:25:14.600 --> 2:25:17.760
 And we are just observing some overall probability

2:25:17.760 --> 2:25:19.680
 of how those paths work.

2:25:19.680 --> 2:25:22.480
 Okay, so when you think about our hypergraphs

2:25:22.480 --> 2:25:24.680
 and all these little updates that are going on,

2:25:24.680 --> 2:25:27.040
 there's a very remarkable thing to realize,

2:25:27.040 --> 2:25:29.240
 which is if you say, well,

2:25:29.240 --> 2:25:32.360
 which particular sequence of updates should you do?

2:25:32.360 --> 2:25:33.760
 Say, well, it's not really defined.

2:25:33.760 --> 2:25:35.400
 You can do any of a whole collection

2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:37.440
 of possible sequences of updates.

2:25:37.440 --> 2:25:42.000
 Okay, that set of possible sequences of updates

2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:44.240
 defines yet another kind of graph

2:25:44.240 --> 2:25:46.120
 that we call a multiway graph.

2:25:46.120 --> 2:25:48.680
 And a multiway graph just is a graph

2:25:48.680 --> 2:25:52.800
 where at every node, there is a choice

2:25:52.800 --> 2:25:55.320
 of several different possible things that could happen.

2:25:55.320 --> 2:25:57.720
 So for example, you go this way, you go that way.

2:25:57.720 --> 2:26:00.920
 Those are two different edges in the multiway graph.

2:26:00.920 --> 2:26:02.640
 And you're building up the set of possibilities.

2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:04.880
 So actually, like, for example, I just made the one,

2:26:04.880 --> 2:26:07.400
 the multiway graph for tic tac toe, okay?

2:26:07.400 --> 2:26:11.000
 So tic tac toe, you start off with some board

2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:12.280
 that, you know, is everything is blank,

2:26:12.280 --> 2:26:15.240
 and then somebody can put down an X somewhere,

2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:18.200
 an O somewhere, and then there are different possibilities.

2:26:18.200 --> 2:26:20.320
 At each stage, there are different possibilities.

2:26:20.320 --> 2:26:22.760
 And so you build up this multiway graph

2:26:22.760 --> 2:26:23.760
 of all those possibilities.

2:26:23.760 --> 2:26:25.960
 Now notice that even in tic tac toe,

2:26:25.960 --> 2:26:28.160
 you have the feature that there can be something

2:26:28.160 --> 2:26:31.000
 where you have two different things that happen

2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:33.400
 and then those branches merge

2:26:33.400 --> 2:26:35.280
 because you end up with the same shape,

2:26:35.280 --> 2:26:37.440
 you know, the same configuration of the board,

2:26:37.440 --> 2:26:40.000
 even though you got there in two different ways.

2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:42.840
 So the thing that's sort of an inevitable feature

2:26:42.840 --> 2:26:47.360
 of our models is that just like quantum mechanics suggests,

2:26:47.360 --> 2:26:48.880
 definite things don't happen.

2:26:48.880 --> 2:26:50.880
 Instead, you get this whole multiway graph

2:26:50.880 --> 2:26:52.760
 of all these possibilities.

2:26:52.760 --> 2:26:55.680
 Okay, so then the question is, so, okay,

2:26:55.680 --> 2:26:58.320
 so that's sort of a picture of what's going on.

2:26:58.320 --> 2:27:00.520
 Now you say, okay, well, quantum mechanics

2:27:00.520 --> 2:27:02.720
 has all these features of, you know,

2:27:02.720 --> 2:27:04.880
 all this mathematical structure and so on.

2:27:04.880 --> 2:27:07.160
 How do you get that mathematical structure?

2:27:07.160 --> 2:27:08.880
 Okay, a couple of things to say.

2:27:08.880 --> 2:27:11.680
 So quantum mechanics is actually, in a sense,

2:27:11.680 --> 2:27:13.960
 two different theories glued together.

2:27:13.960 --> 2:27:15.680
 Quantum mechanics is the theory

2:27:15.680 --> 2:27:18.120
 of how quantum amplitudes work

2:27:18.120 --> 2:27:19.440
 that more or less give you the probabilities

2:27:19.440 --> 2:27:20.720
 of things happening.

2:27:20.720 --> 2:27:22.800
 And it's the theory of quantum measurement,

2:27:22.800 --> 2:27:25.200
 which is the theory of how we actually

2:27:25.200 --> 2:27:27.000
 conclude definite things.

2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:29.080
 Because the mathematics just gives you

2:27:29.080 --> 2:27:30.760
 these quantum amplitudes, which are more or less

2:27:30.760 --> 2:27:32.480
 probabilities of things happening,

2:27:32.480 --> 2:27:35.880
 but yet we actually observe definite things in the world.

2:27:36.920 --> 2:27:39.120
 Quantum measurement has always been a bit mysterious.

2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:41.160
 It's always been something where people just say,

2:27:41.160 --> 2:27:42.400
 well, the mathematics says this,

2:27:42.400 --> 2:27:43.480
 but then you do a measurement,

2:27:43.480 --> 2:27:45.120
 and there are philosophical arguments

2:27:45.120 --> 2:27:46.600
 about what the measurement is.

2:27:46.600 --> 2:27:48.800
 But it's not something where there's a theory

2:27:48.800 --> 2:27:49.720
 of the measurement.

2:27:49.720 --> 2:27:52.120
 Somebody on Reddit also asked,

2:27:53.080 --> 2:27:56.800
 please ask Stephen to tell his story

2:27:56.800 --> 2:27:59.840
 of the double slit experiment.

2:27:59.840 --> 2:28:01.160
 Okay, yeah, I can.

2:28:01.160 --> 2:28:02.880
 Is that, does that make sense?

2:28:02.880 --> 2:28:03.960
 Oh yeah, it makes sense.

2:28:03.960 --> 2:28:05.000
 Absolutely makes sense.

2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:07.760
 Why, is this like a good way to discuss?

2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:08.600
 A little bit.

2:28:08.600 --> 2:28:10.560
 Let me go, let me explain a couple of things first.

2:28:10.560 --> 2:28:13.840
 So the structure of quantum mechanics

2:28:13.840 --> 2:28:16.240
 is mathematically quite complicated.

2:28:16.240 --> 2:28:18.600
 One of the features, let's see,

2:28:18.600 --> 2:28:20.520
 well, how to describe this.

2:28:20.520 --> 2:28:23.800
 Okay, so first point is there's this multiway graph

2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:26.880
 of all these different paths of things

2:28:26.880 --> 2:28:28.760
 that can happen in the world.

2:28:28.760 --> 2:28:32.600
 And the important point is that these,

2:28:32.600 --> 2:28:35.600
 you can have branchings and you can have mergings.

2:28:35.600 --> 2:28:39.680
 Okay, so this property turns out causal invariance

2:28:39.680 --> 2:28:43.360
 is the statement that the number of mergings

2:28:43.360 --> 2:28:45.520
 is equal to the number of branchings.

2:28:45.520 --> 2:28:46.360
 Yeah.

2:28:46.360 --> 2:28:48.720
 So in other words, every time there's a branch,

2:28:48.720 --> 2:28:50.640
 eventually there will also be a merge.

2:28:50.640 --> 2:28:52.600
 In other words, every time there were two possibilities

2:28:52.600 --> 2:28:55.120
 for what might've happened, eventually those will merge.

2:28:55.120 --> 2:28:57.400
 Beautiful concept by the way, but yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:28:57.400 --> 2:29:02.400
 So that idea, okay, so then, so that's one thing

2:29:03.920 --> 2:29:07.680
 and that's closely related to the sort of objectivity

2:29:07.680 --> 2:29:08.520
 in quantum mechanics.

2:29:08.520 --> 2:29:10.720
 The fact that we believe definite things happen,

2:29:10.720 --> 2:29:13.200
 it's because although there are all these different paths,

2:29:13.200 --> 2:29:15.600
 in some sense, because of causal invariance,

2:29:15.600 --> 2:29:17.640
 they all imply the same thing.

2:29:17.640 --> 2:29:19.400
 I'm cheating a little bit in saying that,

2:29:19.400 --> 2:29:22.120
 but that's roughly the essence of what's going on.

2:29:22.120 --> 2:29:24.560
 Okay, next thing to think about

2:29:24.560 --> 2:29:27.440
 is you have this multiway graph,

2:29:27.440 --> 2:29:28.840
 it has all these different possible things

2:29:28.840 --> 2:29:30.040
 that are happening.

2:29:30.040 --> 2:29:32.440
 Now we ask, this multiway graph

2:29:32.440 --> 2:29:34.120
 is sort of evolving with time.

2:29:34.120 --> 2:29:36.680
 Over time, it's branching, it's merging,

2:29:36.680 --> 2:29:38.400
 it's doing all these things, okay?

2:29:39.840 --> 2:29:44.680
 Question we can ask is if we slice it at a particular time,

2:29:44.680 --> 2:29:46.120
 what do we see?

2:29:46.120 --> 2:29:48.840
 And that slice represents in a sense,

2:29:48.840 --> 2:29:51.240
 something to do with the state of the universe

2:29:51.240 --> 2:29:53.080
 at a particular time.

2:29:53.080 --> 2:29:55.080
 So in other words, we've got this multiway graph

2:29:55.080 --> 2:29:56.680
 of all these possibilities,

2:29:56.680 --> 2:30:01.320
 and then we're asking, okay, we take the slice,

2:30:01.320 --> 2:30:04.440
 this slice represents, okay,

2:30:04.440 --> 2:30:05.640
 each of these different paths

2:30:05.640 --> 2:30:07.760
 corresponds to a different quantum possibility

2:30:07.760 --> 2:30:09.320
 for what's happening.

2:30:09.320 --> 2:30:11.440
 When we take the slice, we're saying,

2:30:11.440 --> 2:30:13.120
 what are the set of quantum possibilities

2:30:13.120 --> 2:30:14.960
 that exist at a particular time?

2:30:14.960 --> 2:30:17.640
 And when you say slice, you slice the graph

2:30:17.640 --> 2:30:19.720
 and then there's a bunch of leaves.

2:30:19.720 --> 2:30:20.560
 A bunch of leaves.

2:30:20.560 --> 2:30:23.440
 Those represent the state of things.

2:30:23.440 --> 2:30:26.240
 Right, but then, okay, so the important thing

2:30:26.240 --> 2:30:29.040
 that you are quickly picking up on

2:30:29.040 --> 2:30:31.960
 is that what matters is kind of

2:30:31.960 --> 2:30:34.600
 how these leaves are related to each other.

2:30:34.600 --> 2:30:37.560
 So a good way to tell how leaves are related

2:30:37.560 --> 2:30:39.920
 is just to say on the step before

2:30:39.920 --> 2:30:42.160
 do they have a common ancestor?

2:30:42.160 --> 2:30:43.960
 So two leaves might be,

2:30:43.960 --> 2:30:45.800
 they might have just branched from one thing

2:30:45.800 --> 2:30:47.920
 or they might be far away,

2:30:47.920 --> 2:30:50.720
 way far apart in this graph

2:30:50.720 --> 2:30:52.320
 where to get to a common ancestor,

2:30:52.320 --> 2:30:53.400
 maybe you have to go all the way back

2:30:53.400 --> 2:30:54.240
 to the beginning of the graph,

2:30:54.240 --> 2:30:55.080
 all the way back to the beginning.

2:30:55.080 --> 2:30:57.160
 So there's some kind of measure of distance.

2:30:57.160 --> 2:31:02.000
 Right, but what you get is by making the slice,

2:31:02.000 --> 2:31:05.880
 we call it branchial space, the space of branches.

2:31:05.880 --> 2:31:08.360
 And in this branchial space,

2:31:08.360 --> 2:31:11.240
 you have a graph that represents the relationships

2:31:11.240 --> 2:31:14.640
 between these quantum states in branchial space.

2:31:14.640 --> 2:31:18.000
 You have this notion of distance in branchial space.

2:31:18.000 --> 2:31:18.840
 Okay, so.

2:31:18.840 --> 2:31:20.880
 It's connected to quantum entanglement.

2:31:20.880 --> 2:31:23.520
 Yes, yes, it's basically,

2:31:23.520 --> 2:31:25.640
 the distance in branchial space

2:31:25.640 --> 2:31:27.840
 is kind of an entanglement distance.

2:31:27.840 --> 2:31:28.680
 So this.

2:31:28.680 --> 2:31:29.880
 That's a very nice model.

2:31:29.880 --> 2:31:33.240
 Right, it is very nice, it's very beautiful.

2:31:33.240 --> 2:31:35.520
 I mean, it's so clean.

2:31:35.520 --> 2:31:38.920
 I mean, it's really, and it tells one,

2:31:38.920 --> 2:31:42.840
 okay, so anyway, so then this branchial space

2:31:42.840 --> 2:31:46.080
 has this sort of map of the entanglements

2:31:46.080 --> 2:31:47.760
 between quantum states.

2:31:47.760 --> 2:31:50.360
 So in physical space, we have,

2:31:50.360 --> 2:31:54.680
 so you can say, take, let's say the causal graph,

2:31:54.680 --> 2:31:57.800
 and we can slice that at a particular time,

2:31:57.800 --> 2:31:58.840
 and then we get this map

2:31:58.840 --> 2:32:01.400
 of how things are laid out in physical space.

2:32:01.400 --> 2:32:02.720
 When we do the same kind of thing,

2:32:02.720 --> 2:32:04.840
 there's a thing called the multiway causal graph,

2:32:04.840 --> 2:32:06.360
 which is the analog of a causal graph

2:32:06.360 --> 2:32:07.760
 for the multiway system.

2:32:07.760 --> 2:32:11.360
 We slice that, we get essentially the relationships

2:32:11.360 --> 2:32:13.720
 between things, not in physical space,

2:32:13.720 --> 2:32:15.720
 but in the space of quantum states.

2:32:15.720 --> 2:32:17.040
 It's like which quantum state

2:32:17.040 --> 2:32:19.360
 is similar to which other quantum state.

2:32:19.360 --> 2:32:22.280
 Okay, so now I think next thing to say

2:32:22.280 --> 2:32:24.800
 is just to mention how quantum measurement works.

2:32:24.800 --> 2:32:27.560
 So quantum measurement has to do with reference frames

2:32:27.560 --> 2:32:29.760
 in branchial space.

2:32:29.760 --> 2:32:33.720
 So, okay, so measurement in physical space,

2:32:33.720 --> 2:32:38.720
 it matters whether how we assign spatial position

2:32:38.720 --> 2:32:42.520
 and how we define coordinates in space and time.

2:32:42.520 --> 2:32:45.360
 And that's how we make measurements in ordinary space.

2:32:45.360 --> 2:32:48.240
 Are we making a measurement based on us sitting still here?

2:32:48.240 --> 2:32:49.880
 Are we traveling at half the speed of light

2:32:49.880 --> 2:32:51.600
 and making measurements that way?

2:32:51.600 --> 2:32:53.080
 These are different reference frames

2:32:53.080 --> 2:32:54.760
 in which we're making our measurements.

2:32:54.760 --> 2:32:57.840
 And the relationship between different events

2:32:57.840 --> 2:32:59.720
 and different points in space and time

2:33:00.760 --> 2:33:04.200
 will be different depending on what reference frame we're in.

2:33:04.200 --> 2:33:06.480
 Okay, so then we have this idea

2:33:06.480 --> 2:33:08.880
 of quantum observation frames,

2:33:08.880 --> 2:33:11.040
 which are the analog of reference frames,

2:33:11.040 --> 2:33:13.040
 but in branchial space.

2:33:13.040 --> 2:33:15.880
 And so what happens is what we realize

2:33:15.880 --> 2:33:19.960
 is that a quantum measurement is the observer

2:33:19.960 --> 2:33:23.000
 is sort of arbitrarily determining this reference frame.

2:33:23.000 --> 2:33:26.840
 The observer is saying, I'm going to understand the world

2:33:26.840 --> 2:33:30.560
 by saying that space and time are coordinated this way.

2:33:30.560 --> 2:33:32.600
 I'm gonna understand the world by saying

2:33:32.600 --> 2:33:36.520
 that quantum states and time are coordinated in this way.

2:33:36.520 --> 2:33:38.280
 And essentially what happens is

2:33:38.280 --> 2:33:40.920
 that the process of quantum measurement

2:33:40.920 --> 2:33:44.920
 is a process of deciding how you slice up

2:33:44.920 --> 2:33:48.560
 this multiway system in these quantum observation frames.

2:33:48.560 --> 2:33:51.760
 So in a sense, the observer, the way the observer enters

2:33:51.760 --> 2:33:55.600
 is by their choice of these quantum observation frames.

2:33:55.600 --> 2:33:58.880
 And what happens is that the observer,

2:33:58.880 --> 2:34:00.480
 because, okay, this is again,

2:34:00.480 --> 2:34:03.120
 another stack of other concepts, but anyway,

2:34:03.120 --> 2:34:06.200
 because the observer is computationally bounded,

2:34:06.200 --> 2:34:08.880
 there is a limit to the type of quantum observation frames

2:34:08.880 --> 2:34:09.960
 that they can construct.

2:34:09.960 --> 2:34:12.600
 Interesting, okay, so there's some constraints,

2:34:12.600 --> 2:34:17.600
 some limit on the choice of observation frames.

2:34:17.760 --> 2:34:19.960
 Right, and by the way, I just want to mention

2:34:19.960 --> 2:34:21.840
 that there's a, I mean, it's bizarre,

2:34:21.840 --> 2:34:23.640
 but there's a hierarchy of these things.

2:34:23.640 --> 2:34:27.440
 So in thermodynamics,

2:34:27.440 --> 2:34:29.600
 the fact that we believe entropy increases,

2:34:29.600 --> 2:34:31.480
 we believe things get more disordered,

2:34:31.480 --> 2:34:32.520
 is a consequence of the fact

2:34:32.520 --> 2:34:34.280
 that we can't track each individual molecule.

2:34:34.280 --> 2:34:36.160
 If we could track every single molecule,

2:34:36.160 --> 2:34:38.240
 we could run every movie in reverse, so to speak,

2:34:38.240 --> 2:34:42.200
 and we would not see that things are getting more disordered.

2:34:42.200 --> 2:34:44.800
 But it's because we are computationally bounded,

2:34:44.800 --> 2:34:46.720
 we can only look at these big blobs

2:34:46.720 --> 2:34:49.560
 of what all these molecules collectively do,

2:34:49.560 --> 2:34:52.280
 that we think that things are,

2:34:52.280 --> 2:34:54.920
 that we describe it in terms of entropy increasing

2:34:54.920 --> 2:34:55.800
 and so on.

2:34:55.800 --> 2:34:58.560
 And it's the same phenomenon, basically,

2:34:58.560 --> 2:35:01.520
 and also a consequence of computational irreducibility

2:35:01.520 --> 2:35:04.800
 that causes us to basically be forced to conclude

2:35:04.800 --> 2:35:06.920
 that definite things happen in the world,

2:35:06.920 --> 2:35:08.720
 even though there's this quantum,

2:35:08.720 --> 2:35:10.680
 this set of all these different quantum processes

2:35:10.680 --> 2:35:11.880
 that are going on.

2:35:11.880 --> 2:35:15.400
 So, I mean, I'm skipping a little bit,

2:35:15.400 --> 2:35:18.560
 but that's a rough picture.

2:35:18.560 --> 2:35:21.880
 And in the evolution of the Wolfram Physics Project,

2:35:21.880 --> 2:35:24.280
 where do you feel we stand on some of the puzzles

2:35:24.280 --> 2:35:25.120
 that are along the way?

2:35:25.120 --> 2:35:28.080
 See, you're skipping along a bunch of stuff.

2:35:28.080 --> 2:35:30.440
 It's amazing how much these things are unraveling.

2:35:30.440 --> 2:35:32.480
 I mean, you know, these things, look,

2:35:32.480 --> 2:35:35.640
 it used to be the case that I would agree with Dick Feynman,

2:35:35.640 --> 2:35:38.840
 nobody understands quantum mechanics, including me, okay?

2:35:38.840 --> 2:35:40.120
 I'm getting to the point where I think

2:35:40.120 --> 2:35:41.560
 I actually understand quantum mechanics.

2:35:41.560 --> 2:35:45.720
 My exercise, okay, is can I explain quantum mechanics

2:35:45.720 --> 2:35:48.800
 for real at the level of kind of middle school

2:35:48.800 --> 2:35:50.320
 type explanation?

2:35:50.320 --> 2:35:52.600
 And I'm getting closer, it's getting there.

2:35:52.600 --> 2:35:54.960
 I'm not quite there, I've tried it a few times,

2:35:54.960 --> 2:35:57.640
 and I realized that there are things

2:35:57.640 --> 2:35:59.080
 where I have to start talking about

2:35:59.080 --> 2:36:00.920
 elaborate mathematical concepts and so on.

2:36:00.920 --> 2:36:03.000
 But I think, and you've got to realize

2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:06.280
 that it's not self evident that we can explain

2:36:06.280 --> 2:36:09.240
 at an intuitively graspable level,

2:36:09.240 --> 2:36:12.400
 something which, about the way the universe works,

2:36:12.400 --> 2:36:14.760
 the universe wasn't built for our understanding,

2:36:14.760 --> 2:36:16.280
 so to speak.

2:36:16.280 --> 2:36:21.280
 But I think then, okay, so another important idea

2:36:21.720 --> 2:36:25.280
 is this idea of branchial space, which I mentioned,

2:36:25.280 --> 2:36:27.400
 this sort of space of quantum states.

2:36:27.400 --> 2:36:31.240
 It is, okay, so I mentioned Einstein's equations

2:36:31.240 --> 2:36:36.240
 describing the effect of mass and energy

2:36:37.400 --> 2:36:40.840
 on trajectories of particles, on GD6.

2:36:40.840 --> 2:36:44.920
 The curvature of physical space is associated

2:36:44.920 --> 2:36:47.040
 with the presence of energy,

2:36:47.040 --> 2:36:49.400
 according to Einstein's equations, okay?

2:36:49.400 --> 2:36:51.920
 So it turns out that, rather amazingly,

2:36:51.920 --> 2:36:54.880
 the same thing is true in branchial space.

2:36:54.880 --> 2:36:57.360
 So it turns out the presence of energy

2:36:57.360 --> 2:36:59.440
 or more accurately Lagrangian density,

2:36:59.440 --> 2:37:03.200
 which is a kind of relativistic invariant version of energy,

2:37:03.200 --> 2:37:08.200
 the presence of that causes essentially deflection of GD6

2:37:08.560 --> 2:37:11.160
 in this branchial space, okay?

2:37:11.160 --> 2:37:12.560
 So you might say, so what?

2:37:12.560 --> 2:37:17.040
 Well, it turns out that the sort of the best formulation

2:37:17.040 --> 2:37:18.800
 we have of quantum mechanics,

2:37:18.800 --> 2:37:21.360
 this Feynman path integral,

2:37:21.360 --> 2:37:26.200
 is a thing that describes quantum processes

2:37:26.200 --> 2:37:31.200
 in terms of mathematics that can be interpreted as,

2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:33.880
 well, in quantum mechanics, the big thing

2:37:33.880 --> 2:37:35.360
 is you get these quantum amplitudes,

2:37:35.360 --> 2:37:38.280
 which are complex numbers that represent,

2:37:38.280 --> 2:37:39.400
 when you combine them together,

2:37:39.400 --> 2:37:41.560
 represent probabilities of things happening.

2:37:41.560 --> 2:37:42.840
 And so the big story has been,

2:37:42.840 --> 2:37:45.320
 how do you derive these quantum amplitudes?

2:37:45.320 --> 2:37:47.480
 And people think these quantum amplitudes,

2:37:47.480 --> 2:37:49.160
 they have a complex number,

2:37:49.160 --> 2:37:51.200
 has a real part and an imaginary part.

2:37:51.200 --> 2:37:53.920
 You can also think of it as a magnitude and a phase.

2:37:53.920 --> 2:37:57.160
 And people have sort of thought these quantum amplitudes

2:37:57.160 --> 2:38:00.040
 have magnitude and phase, and you compute those together.

2:38:00.040 --> 2:38:03.680
 Turns out that the magnitude and the phase

2:38:03.680 --> 2:38:06.120
 come from completely different places.

2:38:06.120 --> 2:38:10.080
 The magnitude comes, okay, so how do you compute things

2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:10.920
 in quantum mechanics?

2:38:10.920 --> 2:38:13.360
 Roughly, I'm telling you, I'm getting there

2:38:13.360 --> 2:38:15.080
 to be able to do this at a middle school level,

2:38:15.080 --> 2:38:16.160
 but I'm not there yet.

2:38:17.720 --> 2:38:20.440
 Roughly what happens is you're asking,

2:38:20.440 --> 2:38:24.160
 does this state in quantum mechanics

2:38:24.160 --> 2:38:27.080
 evolve to this other state in quantum mechanics?

2:38:27.080 --> 2:38:30.600
 And you can think about that like a particle traveling

2:38:30.600 --> 2:38:33.240
 or something traveling through physical space,

2:38:33.240 --> 2:38:36.160
 but instead it's traveling through branchial space.

2:38:36.160 --> 2:38:38.920
 And so what's happening is, does this quantum state evolve

2:38:38.920 --> 2:38:39.920
 to this other quantum state?

2:38:39.920 --> 2:38:42.160
 It's like saying, does this object move

2:38:42.160 --> 2:38:45.160
 from this place in space to this other place in space?

2:38:45.160 --> 2:38:49.360
 Okay, now the way that these quantum amplitudes

2:38:49.360 --> 2:38:54.000
 characterize kind of to what extent the thing

2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:56.400
 will successfully reach some particular point

2:38:56.400 --> 2:38:58.560
 in branchial space, just like in physical space,

2:38:58.560 --> 2:39:00.720
 you could say, oh, it had a certain velocity

2:39:00.720 --> 2:39:02.400
 and it went in this direction.

2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:05.160
 In branchial space, there's a similar kind of concept.

2:39:05.160 --> 2:39:08.280
 Is there a nice way to visualize for me now

2:39:08.280 --> 2:39:10.560
 mentally branchial space?

2:39:10.560 --> 2:39:13.720
 It's just, you have this hypergraph,

2:39:13.720 --> 2:39:15.720
 sorry, you have this multiway graph.

2:39:15.720 --> 2:39:18.440
 It's this big branching thing, branching and merging thing.

2:39:18.440 --> 2:39:21.800
 But I mean, like moving through that space,

2:39:21.800 --> 2:39:24.360
 I'm just trying to understand what that looks like.

2:39:25.920 --> 2:39:29.280
 You know, that space is probably exponential dimensional,

2:39:29.280 --> 2:39:32.280
 which makes it again, another can of worms

2:39:32.280 --> 2:39:33.880
 in understanding what's going on.

2:39:33.880 --> 2:39:36.920
 That space as in an ordinary space,

2:39:36.920 --> 2:39:39.160
 this hypergraph, the spatial hypergraph

2:39:39.160 --> 2:39:42.600
 limits to something which is like a manifold,

2:39:42.600 --> 2:39:45.040
 like something like three dimensional space.

2:39:45.040 --> 2:39:48.720
 Almost certainly the multiway graph limits

2:39:48.720 --> 2:39:52.360
 to a Hilbert space, which is something that,

2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:55.560
 I mean, it's just a weird exponential dimensional space.

2:39:55.560 --> 2:39:57.400
 And by the way, you can ask, I mean,

2:39:57.400 --> 2:39:58.880
 there are much weirder things that go on.

2:39:58.880 --> 2:40:00.720
 For example, one of the things I've been interested in

2:40:00.720 --> 2:40:03.920
 is the expansion of the universe in branchial space.

2:40:03.920 --> 2:40:07.080
 So we know the universe is expanding in physical space,

2:40:07.080 --> 2:40:09.200
 but the universe is probably also expanding

2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:10.920
 in branchial space.

2:40:10.920 --> 2:40:13.280
 So that means the number of quantum states

2:40:13.280 --> 2:40:15.760
 of the universe is increasing with time.

2:40:15.760 --> 2:40:17.880
 The diameter of the thing is growing.

2:40:17.880 --> 2:40:19.480
 Right, so that means that the,

2:40:19.480 --> 2:40:22.760
 and by the way, this is related

2:40:22.760 --> 2:40:25.080
 to whether quantum computing can ever work.

2:40:28.200 --> 2:40:29.040
 Why?

2:40:29.040 --> 2:40:30.440
 Okay, so let me explain why.

2:40:30.440 --> 2:40:32.840
 So let's talk about, okay, so first of all,

2:40:32.840 --> 2:40:35.320
 just to finish the thought about quantum amplitudes,

2:40:35.320 --> 2:40:37.320
 that the incredibly beautiful thing,

2:40:37.320 --> 2:40:40.680
 but I'm just very excited about this.

2:40:40.680 --> 2:40:44.640
 The fine path integral is this formula.

2:40:44.640 --> 2:40:47.360
 It says that the amplitude, the quantum amplitude

2:40:47.360 --> 2:40:49.480
 is E to the I S over H bar,

2:40:49.480 --> 2:40:51.560
 where S is the thing called the action.

2:40:51.560 --> 2:40:55.720
 And it, okay, so that can be thought of

2:40:55.720 --> 2:40:59.280
 as representing a deflection of the angle

2:40:59.280 --> 2:41:02.200
 of this path in the multiway graph.

2:41:02.200 --> 2:41:05.040
 So it's a deflection of a geodesic in the multiway path

2:41:05.040 --> 2:41:06.960
 that is caused by this thing called the action,

2:41:06.960 --> 2:41:10.040
 which is essentially associated with energy, okay?

2:41:10.040 --> 2:41:13.760
 And so this is a deflection of a path in branchial space

2:41:13.760 --> 2:41:15.520
 that is described by this path integral,

2:41:15.520 --> 2:41:17.760
 which is the thing that is the mathematical essence

2:41:17.760 --> 2:41:19.440
 of quantum mechanics.

2:41:19.440 --> 2:41:22.760
 Turns out that deflection is,

2:41:22.760 --> 2:41:25.240
 the deflection of geodesics in branchial space

2:41:25.240 --> 2:41:28.720
 follows the exact same mathematical setup

2:41:28.720 --> 2:41:31.880
 as the deflection of geodesics in physical space,

2:41:31.880 --> 2:41:34.280
 except the deflection of geodesics in physical space

2:41:34.280 --> 2:41:36.480
 is described with Einstein's equations.

2:41:36.480 --> 2:41:38.600
 The deflection of geodesics in branchial space

2:41:38.600 --> 2:41:40.880
 is defined by the Feynman path integral,

2:41:40.880 --> 2:41:42.800
 and they are the same.

2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:45.760
 In other words, they are mathematically the same.

2:41:45.760 --> 2:41:48.360
 So that means that general relativity

2:41:48.360 --> 2:41:53.200
 is a story of essentially motion in physical space.

2:41:53.200 --> 2:41:55.560
 Quantum mechanics is a story of essentially motion

2:41:55.560 --> 2:41:57.320
 in branchial space.

2:41:57.320 --> 2:42:01.360
 And the underlying equation for those two things,

2:42:01.360 --> 2:42:02.560
 although it's presented differently

2:42:02.560 --> 2:42:04.160
 because one's interested in different things

2:42:04.160 --> 2:42:06.080
 in branchial space than physical space,

2:42:06.080 --> 2:42:08.720
 but the underlying equation is the same.

2:42:08.720 --> 2:42:13.440
 So in other words, it's just these two theories,

2:42:13.440 --> 2:42:14.600
 which are those two sort of pillars

2:42:14.600 --> 2:42:16.320
 of 20th century physics,

2:42:16.320 --> 2:42:19.080
 which have seemed to be off in different directions,

2:42:19.080 --> 2:42:21.760
 are actually facets of the exact same theory.

2:42:24.280 --> 2:42:26.960
 That's exciting to see where that evolves

2:42:26.960 --> 2:42:29.120
 and exciting that that just is there.

2:42:29.120 --> 2:42:31.000
 Right, I mean, to me,

2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:34.480
 look, having spent some part of my early life

2:42:34.480 --> 2:42:37.040
 working in the context of these theories

2:42:37.040 --> 2:42:39.400
 of 20th century physics,

2:42:39.400 --> 2:42:41.960
 it's, they just, they seem so different.

2:42:41.960 --> 2:42:44.080
 And the fact that they're really the same

2:42:44.080 --> 2:42:46.480
 is just really amazing.

2:42:46.480 --> 2:42:49.120
 Actually, you mentioned double slit experiment, okay?

2:42:49.120 --> 2:42:50.280
 So the double slit experiment

2:42:50.280 --> 2:42:54.360
 is an interference phenomenon where you say there are,

2:42:54.360 --> 2:42:56.600
 you can have a photon or an electron,

2:42:56.600 --> 2:42:58.240
 and you say there are these two slits

2:42:58.240 --> 2:43:00.320
 that could have gone through either one,

2:43:00.320 --> 2:43:02.560
 but there is this interference pattern

2:43:02.560 --> 2:43:05.080
 where there's destructive interference,

2:43:05.080 --> 2:43:07.200
 where you might've said in classical physics,

2:43:07.200 --> 2:43:09.000
 oh, well, if there are two slits,

2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:10.440
 then there's a better chance

2:43:10.440 --> 2:43:12.120
 that it gets through one or the other of them.

2:43:12.120 --> 2:43:13.240
 But in quantum mechanics,

2:43:13.240 --> 2:43:15.720
 there's this phenomenon of destructive interference

2:43:15.720 --> 2:43:18.120
 that means that even though there are two slits,

2:43:18.120 --> 2:43:20.240
 two can lead to nothing,

2:43:20.240 --> 2:43:22.560
 as opposed to two leading to more

2:43:22.560 --> 2:43:25.240
 than, for example, one slit.

2:43:25.240 --> 2:43:27.480
 And what happens in this model,

2:43:27.480 --> 2:43:29.040
 and we've just been understanding this

2:43:29.040 --> 2:43:30.760
 in the last few weeks, actually,

2:43:30.760 --> 2:43:34.400
 is that what essentially happens

2:43:34.400 --> 2:43:38.040
 is that the double slit experiment

2:43:38.040 --> 2:43:39.360
 is a story of the interface

2:43:39.360 --> 2:43:41.960
 between branchial space and physical space.

2:43:41.960 --> 2:43:43.080
 And what's essentially happening

2:43:43.080 --> 2:43:45.520
 is that the destructive interference

2:43:45.520 --> 2:43:48.520
 is the result of the two possible paths

2:43:48.520 --> 2:43:51.200
 associated with photons going through those two slits

2:43:51.200 --> 2:43:53.960
 winding up at opposite ends of branchial space.

2:43:53.960 --> 2:43:57.120
 And so that's why there's sort of nothing there

2:43:57.120 --> 2:43:58.440
 when you look at it,

2:43:58.440 --> 2:44:02.120
 is because these two different sort of branches

2:44:02.120 --> 2:44:03.920
 couldn't get merged together

2:44:03.920 --> 2:44:06.240
 to produce something that you can measure

2:44:06.240 --> 2:44:07.680
 in physical space.

2:44:07.680 --> 2:44:10.680
 Is there a lot to be understood about branchial space?

2:44:10.680 --> 2:44:13.920
 I guess, mathematically speaking.

2:44:13.920 --> 2:44:16.400
 Yes, it's a very beautiful mathematical thing.

2:44:16.400 --> 2:44:18.280
 And it's very, I mean, by the way,

2:44:18.280 --> 2:44:22.000
 this whole theory is just amazingly rich

2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:24.920
 in terms of the mathematics that it says should exist.

2:44:24.920 --> 2:44:26.120
 Okay, so for example,

2:44:26.120 --> 2:44:30.320
 calculus is a story of infinitesimal change

2:44:30.320 --> 2:44:32.000
 in integer dimensional space,

2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:34.880
 one dimensional, two dimensional, three dimensional space.

2:44:34.880 --> 2:44:37.960
 We need a theory of infinitesimal change

2:44:37.960 --> 2:44:41.440
 in fractional dimensional and dynamic dimensional space.

2:44:41.440 --> 2:44:42.640
 No such theory exists.

2:44:42.640 --> 2:44:45.280
 So there's tools of mathematics that are needed here.

2:44:45.280 --> 2:44:46.120
 Right.

2:44:46.120 --> 2:44:47.040
 And this is a motivation for that actually.

2:44:47.040 --> 2:44:50.320
 Right, and there are indications

2:44:50.320 --> 2:44:51.760
 and we can do computer experiments

2:44:51.760 --> 2:44:53.560
 and we can see how it's gonna come out,

2:44:53.560 --> 2:44:58.040
 but we need to, the actual mathematics doesn't exist.

2:44:58.040 --> 2:45:00.720
 And in branchial space, it's actually even worse.

2:45:00.720 --> 2:45:04.720
 There's even more sort of layers of mathematics that are,

2:45:04.720 --> 2:45:06.240
 we can see how it works roughly

2:45:06.240 --> 2:45:07.960
 by doing computer experiments,

2:45:07.960 --> 2:45:10.120
 but to really understand it,

2:45:10.120 --> 2:45:13.320
 we need more sort of mathematical sophistication.

2:45:13.320 --> 2:45:14.880
 So quantum computers.

2:45:14.880 --> 2:45:17.800
 Okay, so the basic idea of quantum computers,

2:45:17.800 --> 2:45:19.960
 the promise of quantum computers

2:45:19.960 --> 2:45:23.640
 is quantum mechanics does things in parallel.

2:45:23.640 --> 2:45:26.960
 And so you can sort of intrinsically do computations

2:45:26.960 --> 2:45:27.880
 in parallel.

2:45:27.880 --> 2:45:30.160
 And somehow that can be much more efficient

2:45:30.160 --> 2:45:33.280
 than just doing them one after another.

2:45:33.280 --> 2:45:36.240
 And I actually worked on quantum computing a bit

2:45:36.240 --> 2:45:40.680
 with Dick Feynman back in 1981, two, three,

2:45:40.680 --> 2:45:41.800
 that kind of timeframe.

2:45:41.800 --> 2:45:42.640
 And we...

2:45:42.640 --> 2:45:43.680
 It's a fascinating image.

2:45:43.680 --> 2:45:46.600
 You and Feynman working on quantum computers.

2:45:46.600 --> 2:45:47.880
 Well, we tried to work,

2:45:47.880 --> 2:45:51.040
 the big thing we tried to do was invent a randomness chip

2:45:51.040 --> 2:45:53.800
 that would generate randomness at a high speed

2:45:53.800 --> 2:45:55.480
 using quantum mechanics.

2:45:55.480 --> 2:45:58.920
 And the discovery that that wasn't really possible

2:45:58.920 --> 2:46:01.520
 was part of the story of,

2:46:01.520 --> 2:46:03.000
 we never really wrote anything about it.

2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:04.240
 I think maybe he wrote some stuff,

2:46:04.240 --> 2:46:07.520
 but we didn't write stuff about what we figured out

2:46:07.520 --> 2:46:10.080
 about sort of the fact that it really seemed like

2:46:10.080 --> 2:46:12.320
 the measurement process in quantum mechanics

2:46:12.320 --> 2:46:15.680
 was a serious damper on what was possible to do

2:46:15.680 --> 2:46:19.600
 in sort of the possible advantages of quantum mechanics

2:46:19.600 --> 2:46:20.760
 for computing.

2:46:20.760 --> 2:46:24.800
 But anyway, so the sort of the promise of quantum computing

2:46:24.800 --> 2:46:28.320
 is let's say you're trying to factor an integer.

2:46:28.320 --> 2:46:30.040
 Well, you can, instead of,

2:46:30.040 --> 2:46:31.560
 when you factor an integer, you might say,

2:46:31.560 --> 2:46:32.720
 well, does this factor work?

2:46:32.720 --> 2:46:33.560
 Does this factor work?

2:46:33.560 --> 2:46:34.680
 Does this factor work?

2:46:35.680 --> 2:46:37.160
 In ordinary computing,

2:46:37.160 --> 2:46:39.120
 it seems like we pretty much just have to try

2:46:39.120 --> 2:46:40.520
 all these different factors,

2:46:41.680 --> 2:46:43.160
 kind of one after another.

2:46:43.160 --> 2:46:45.200
 But in quantum mechanics, you might have the idea,

2:46:45.200 --> 2:46:48.360
 oh, you can just sort of have the physics,

2:46:48.360 --> 2:46:51.320
 try all of them in parallel, okay?

2:46:51.320 --> 2:46:56.120
 And there's this algorithm, Shor's algorithm,

2:46:56.120 --> 2:46:58.760
 which allows you,

2:46:58.760 --> 2:47:01.080
 according to the formalism of quantum mechanics,

2:47:01.080 --> 2:47:02.400
 to do everything in parallel

2:47:02.400 --> 2:47:05.320
 and to do it much faster than you can on a classical computer.

2:47:05.320 --> 2:47:08.120
 Okay, the only little footnote is

2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:09.920
 you have to figure out what the answer is.

2:47:09.920 --> 2:47:12.000
 You have to measure the result.

2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:13.960
 So the quantum mechanics internally has figured out

2:47:13.960 --> 2:47:15.520
 all these different branches,

2:47:15.520 --> 2:47:17.880
 but then you have to pull all these branches together

2:47:17.880 --> 2:47:21.040
 to say, and the classical answer is this, okay?

2:47:21.040 --> 2:47:22.600
 The standard theory of quantum mechanics

2:47:22.600 --> 2:47:24.200
 does not tell you how to do that.

2:47:24.200 --> 2:47:26.160
 It tells you how the branching works,

2:47:26.160 --> 2:47:27.880
 but it doesn't tell you the process

2:47:27.880 --> 2:47:30.240
 of corralling all these things together.

2:47:30.240 --> 2:47:32.800
 And that process, which intuitively you can see

2:47:32.800 --> 2:47:34.400
 is gonna be kind of tricky,

2:47:34.400 --> 2:47:37.080
 but our model actually does tell you

2:47:37.080 --> 2:47:40.200
 how that process of pulling things together works.

2:47:40.200 --> 2:47:42.880
 And the answer seems to be, we're not absolutely sure.

2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:45.320
 We've only got to two times three so far

2:47:46.720 --> 2:47:50.520
 which is kind of in this factorization

2:47:50.520 --> 2:47:51.360
 in quantum computers.

2:47:51.360 --> 2:47:55.440
 But we can, what seems to be the case

2:47:55.440 --> 2:47:58.520
 is that the advantage you get from the parallelization

2:47:58.520 --> 2:48:01.200
 from quantum mechanics is lost

2:48:01.200 --> 2:48:03.520
 from the amount that you have to spend

2:48:03.520 --> 2:48:05.320
 pulling together all those parallel threads

2:48:05.320 --> 2:48:07.680
 to get to a classical answer at the end.

2:48:07.680 --> 2:48:10.280
 Now, that phenomenon is not unrelated

2:48:10.280 --> 2:48:11.880
 to various decoherence phenomena

2:48:11.880 --> 2:48:14.320
 that are seen in practical quantum computers and so on.

2:48:14.320 --> 2:48:16.760
 I mean, I should say as a very practical point,

2:48:16.760 --> 2:48:19.080
 I mean, it's like, should people stop bothering

2:48:19.080 --> 2:48:20.760
 to do quantum computing research?

2:48:20.760 --> 2:48:23.120
 No, because what they're really doing

2:48:23.120 --> 2:48:25.240
 is they're trying to use physics

2:48:25.240 --> 2:48:28.720
 to get to a new level of what's possible in computing.

2:48:28.720 --> 2:48:30.920
 And that's a completely valid activity.

2:48:30.920 --> 2:48:33.400
 Whether you can really put, you know,

2:48:33.400 --> 2:48:34.240
 whether you can say,

2:48:34.240 --> 2:48:36.000
 oh, you can solve an NP complete problem.

2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:39.120
 You can reduce exponential time to polynomial time.

2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:40.600
 You know, we're not sure.

2:48:40.600 --> 2:48:43.080
 And I'm suspecting the answer is no,

2:48:43.080 --> 2:48:46.080
 but that's not relevant to the practical speed ups

2:48:46.080 --> 2:48:48.520
 you can get by using different kinds of technologies,

2:48:48.520 --> 2:48:52.320
 different kinds of physics to do basic computing.

2:48:52.320 --> 2:48:53.680
 But you're saying, I mean,

2:48:53.680 --> 2:48:55.280
 some of the models you're playing with,

2:48:55.280 --> 2:49:00.280
 the indication is that to get all the sheep back together

2:49:02.640 --> 2:49:05.960
 and, you know, to corral everything together,

2:49:05.960 --> 2:49:10.120
 to get the actual solution to the algorithm is...

2:49:10.120 --> 2:49:10.960
 You lose all the...

2:49:10.960 --> 2:49:12.240
 You lose all of the...

2:49:12.240 --> 2:49:14.400
 By the way, I mean, so again, this question,

2:49:14.400 --> 2:49:16.600
 do we actually know what we're talking about

2:49:16.600 --> 2:49:18.240
 about quantum computing and so on?

2:49:18.240 --> 2:49:22.440
 So again, we're doing proof by compilation.

2:49:22.440 --> 2:49:24.880
 So we have a quantum computing framework

2:49:24.880 --> 2:49:26.080
 in Wolfram language,

2:49:26.080 --> 2:49:26.920
 and which is, you know,

2:49:26.920 --> 2:49:28.360
 a standard quantum computing framework

2:49:28.360 --> 2:49:31.080
 that represents things in terms of the standard,

2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:32.840
 you know, formalism of quantum mechanics.

2:49:32.840 --> 2:49:36.920
 And we have a compiler that simply compiles

2:49:36.920 --> 2:49:41.520
 the representation of quantum gates into multiway systems.

2:49:41.520 --> 2:49:43.920
 So, and in fact, the message that I got

2:49:43.920 --> 2:49:46.000
 was from somebody who's working on the project

2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:50.360
 who has managed to compile one of the sort of

2:49:50.360 --> 2:49:53.200
 a core formalism based on category theory

2:49:53.200 --> 2:49:57.520
 and core quantum formalism into multiway systems.

2:49:57.520 --> 2:49:58.360
 So this is...

2:49:58.360 --> 2:50:00.160
 When you say multiway system, these multiway graphs?

2:50:00.160 --> 2:50:01.000
 Yes.

2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:02.000
 So you're compiling...

2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:03.200
 Yeah, okay, that's awesome.

2:50:03.200 --> 2:50:05.200
 And then you can do all kinds of experiments

2:50:05.200 --> 2:50:06.280
 on that multiway graph.

2:50:06.280 --> 2:50:08.640
 Right, but the point is that what we're saying is

2:50:08.640 --> 2:50:10.400
 the thing we've got this representation

2:50:10.400 --> 2:50:12.000
 of let's say Shor's algorithm

2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:14.040
 in terms of standard quantum gates.

2:50:14.040 --> 2:50:17.480
 And it's just a pure matter of sort of computation

2:50:17.480 --> 2:50:19.240
 to just say that is equivalent.

2:50:19.240 --> 2:50:23.360
 We will get the same result as running this multiway system.

2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:26.640
 Can you do complexity analysis on that multiway system?

2:50:26.640 --> 2:50:28.600
 Well, that's what we've been trying to do, yes.

2:50:28.600 --> 2:50:29.440
 We're getting there.

2:50:29.440 --> 2:50:30.280
 We haven't done that yet.

2:50:30.280 --> 2:50:32.520
 I mean, there's a pretty good indication

2:50:32.520 --> 2:50:33.480
 of how that's gonna work out.

2:50:33.480 --> 2:50:36.280
 We've done, as I say, our computer experiments.

2:50:36.280 --> 2:50:39.440
 We've unimpressively gotten to about two times three

2:50:39.440 --> 2:50:41.080
 in terms of factorization,

2:50:41.080 --> 2:50:43.120
 which is kind of about how far people have got

2:50:43.120 --> 2:50:45.440
 with physical quantum computers as well.

2:50:45.440 --> 2:50:48.040
 But yes, we will be able to do...

2:50:48.040 --> 2:50:50.480
 We definitely will be able to do complexity analysis

2:50:50.480 --> 2:50:51.800
 and we will be able to know.

2:50:51.800 --> 2:50:55.240
 So the one remaining hope for quantum computing

2:50:55.240 --> 2:50:58.200
 really, really working at this formal level

2:50:58.200 --> 2:51:01.120
 of quantum brand exponential stuff being done

2:51:01.120 --> 2:51:03.080
 in polynomial time and so on.

2:51:03.080 --> 2:51:05.280
 The one hope, which is very bizarre,

2:51:05.280 --> 2:51:09.000
 is that you can kind of piggyback

2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:11.240
 on the expansion of branchial space.

2:51:11.240 --> 2:51:13.480
 So here's how that might work.

2:51:13.480 --> 2:51:17.160
 So you think, you know, energy conservation,

2:51:17.160 --> 2:51:18.720
 standard thing in high school physics,

2:51:18.720 --> 2:51:20.600
 energy is conserved, right?

2:51:20.600 --> 2:51:23.640
 But now you imagine, you think about energy

2:51:23.640 --> 2:51:25.000
 in the context of cosmology

2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:26.920
 and the context of the whole universe.

2:51:26.920 --> 2:51:28.680
 It's a much more complicated story.

2:51:28.680 --> 2:51:30.800
 The expansion of the universe kind of violates

2:51:30.800 --> 2:51:32.520
 energy conservation.

2:51:32.520 --> 2:51:35.000
 And so for example, if you imagine you've got two galaxies,

2:51:35.000 --> 2:51:37.080
 they're receding from each other very quickly.

2:51:37.080 --> 2:51:39.400
 They've got two big central black holes.

2:51:39.400 --> 2:51:43.040
 You connect a spring between these two central black holes.

2:51:43.040 --> 2:51:44.640
 Not easy to do in practice,

2:51:44.640 --> 2:51:46.600
 but let's imagine you could do it.

2:51:46.600 --> 2:51:49.200
 Now that spring is being pulled apart.

2:51:49.200 --> 2:51:52.400
 It's getting more potential energy in the spring

2:51:52.400 --> 2:51:55.120
 as a result of the expansion of the universe.

2:51:55.120 --> 2:51:59.040
 So in a sense, you are piggybacking on the expansion

2:51:59.040 --> 2:52:00.520
 that exists in the universe

2:52:00.520 --> 2:52:03.120
 and the sort of violation of energy conservation

2:52:03.120 --> 2:52:05.840
 that's associated with that cosmological expansion

2:52:05.840 --> 2:52:07.160
 to essentially get energy.

2:52:07.160 --> 2:52:09.680
 You're essentially building a perpetual motion machine

2:52:09.680 --> 2:52:12.400
 by using the expansion of the universe.

2:52:12.400 --> 2:52:15.280
 And that is a physical version of that.

2:52:15.280 --> 2:52:17.640
 It is conceivable that the same thing can be done

2:52:17.640 --> 2:52:22.640
 in branchial space to essentially mine the expansion

2:52:22.640 --> 2:52:24.880
 of the universe in branchial space

2:52:24.880 --> 2:52:29.880
 as a way to get sort of quantum computing for free,

2:52:29.880 --> 2:52:32.280
 so to speak, just from the expansion of the universe

2:52:32.280 --> 2:52:33.520
 in branchial space.

2:52:33.520 --> 2:52:35.840
 Now, the physical space version is kind of absurd

2:52:35.840 --> 2:52:39.520
 and involves springs between black holes and so on.

2:52:39.520 --> 2:52:42.080
 It's conceivable that the branchial space version

2:52:42.080 --> 2:52:43.560
 is not as absurd

2:52:43.560 --> 2:52:45.840
 and that it's actually something you can reach

2:52:45.840 --> 2:52:48.600
 with physical things you can build in labs and so on.

2:52:48.600 --> 2:52:49.680
 We don't know yet.

2:52:49.680 --> 2:52:51.320
 Okay, so like you were saying,

2:52:51.320 --> 2:52:54.040
 the branch of space might be expanding

2:52:54.040 --> 2:52:57.120
 and there might be something that could be exploited.

2:52:57.120 --> 2:52:59.040
 Right, in the same kind of way

2:52:59.040 --> 2:53:03.720
 that you can exploit that expansion of the universe

2:53:03.720 --> 2:53:06.560
 in principle, in physical space.

2:53:06.560 --> 2:53:08.520
 You just have like a glimmer of hope.

2:53:08.520 --> 2:53:09.640
 Right, I think that the,

2:53:09.640 --> 2:53:11.800
 look, I think the real answer is going to be

2:53:11.800 --> 2:53:13.960
 that for practical purposes,

2:53:13.960 --> 2:53:18.240
 the official brand that says you can do exponential things

2:53:18.240 --> 2:53:20.480
 in polynomial time is probably not gonna work.

2:53:20.480 --> 2:53:22.320
 For people curious to kind of learn more,

2:53:22.320 --> 2:53:24.680
 so this is more like, it's not middle school,

2:53:24.680 --> 2:53:27.880
 we're gonna go to elementary school for a second.

2:53:27.880 --> 2:53:30.320
 Maybe middle school, let's go to middle school.

2:53:31.320 --> 2:53:36.320
 So if I were to try to maybe write a pamphlet

2:53:38.280 --> 2:53:41.920
 of like Wolfram physics project for dummies,

2:53:42.760 --> 2:53:47.280
 AKA for me, or maybe make a video on the basics,

2:53:47.280 --> 2:53:51.240
 but not just the basics of the physics project,

2:53:51.240 --> 2:53:58.240
 but the basics plus the most beautiful central ideas.

2:53:59.280 --> 2:54:01.200
 How would you go about doing that?

2:54:01.200 --> 2:54:02.720
 Could you help me out a little bit?

2:54:02.720 --> 2:54:05.760
 Yeah, yeah, I mean, as a really practical matter,

2:54:05.760 --> 2:54:10.280
 we have this kind of visual summary picture that we made,

2:54:10.280 --> 2:54:12.320
 which I think is a pretty good,

2:54:12.320 --> 2:54:14.520
 when I've tried to explain this to people

2:54:14.520 --> 2:54:17.120
 and it's a pretty good place to start.

2:54:17.120 --> 2:54:19.800
 As you got this rule, you apply the rule,

2:54:19.800 --> 2:54:22.760
 you're building up this big hypergraph,

2:54:22.760 --> 2:54:24.560
 you've got all these possibilities,

2:54:24.560 --> 2:54:25.960
 you're kind of thinking about that

2:54:25.960 --> 2:54:27.680
 in terms of quantum mechanics.

2:54:27.680 --> 2:54:30.640
 I mean, that's a decent place to start.

2:54:30.640 --> 2:54:33.000
 So basically the things we've talked about,

2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:36.240
 which is space represented as a hypergraph,

2:54:37.120 --> 2:54:40.760
 transformation of that space is kind of time.

2:54:40.760 --> 2:54:41.600
 Yes.

2:54:41.600 --> 2:54:43.040
 And then...

2:54:43.040 --> 2:54:45.080
 Structure of that space,

2:54:45.080 --> 2:54:47.840
 the curvature of that space has gravity.

2:54:47.840 --> 2:54:49.440
 That can be explained without going anywhere

2:54:49.440 --> 2:54:51.240
 near quantum mechanics.

2:54:51.240 --> 2:54:53.120
 I would say that's actually easier to explain

2:54:53.120 --> 2:54:54.320
 than special relativity.

2:54:55.200 --> 2:54:58.440
 Oh, so going into general, so go into curvature.

2:54:58.440 --> 2:54:59.880
 Yeah, I mean, special relativity,

2:54:59.880 --> 2:55:03.520
 I think it's a little bit elaborate to explain.

2:55:03.520 --> 2:55:05.600
 And honestly, you only care about it

2:55:05.600 --> 2:55:06.840
 if you know about special relativity,

2:55:06.840 --> 2:55:08.000
 if you know how special relativity

2:55:08.000 --> 2:55:09.920
 is ordinarily derived and so on.

2:55:09.920 --> 2:55:11.800
 So general relativity is easier.

2:55:11.800 --> 2:55:12.800
 Is easier, yes.

2:55:12.800 --> 2:55:13.800
 And then what about quantum?

2:55:13.800 --> 2:55:16.320
 What's the easiest way to reveal...

2:55:16.320 --> 2:55:19.320
 I think the basic point is just this.

2:55:19.320 --> 2:55:22.160
 This fact that there are all these different branches,

2:55:22.160 --> 2:55:25.320
 that there's this kind of map of how the branches work.

2:55:25.320 --> 2:55:30.320
 And that, I mean, I think actually the recent things

2:55:30.600 --> 2:55:32.280
 that we have about the double slit experiment

2:55:32.280 --> 2:55:34.920
 are pretty good, because you can actually see this.

2:55:34.920 --> 2:55:39.080
 You can see how the double slit phenomenon arises

2:55:39.080 --> 2:55:41.360
 from just features of these graphs.

2:55:41.360 --> 2:55:43.880
 Now, having said that,

2:55:43.880 --> 2:55:47.080
 there is a little bit of sleight of hand there

2:55:47.080 --> 2:55:49.880
 because the true story of the way

2:55:49.880 --> 2:55:51.800
 that double slit thing works

2:55:51.800 --> 2:55:55.080
 depends on the coordination of branchial space

2:55:55.080 --> 2:55:57.800
 that, for example, in our internal team,

2:55:57.800 --> 2:56:00.200
 there is still a vigorous battle going on

2:56:00.200 --> 2:56:01.560
 about how that works.

2:56:01.560 --> 2:56:04.320
 And what's becoming clear is...

2:56:04.320 --> 2:56:05.880
 I mean, what's becoming clear

2:56:05.880 --> 2:56:08.840
 is that it's mathematically really quite interesting.

2:56:08.840 --> 2:56:10.720
 I mean, that is that there's a...

2:56:10.720 --> 2:56:13.120
 It involves essentially putting space filling curves.

2:56:13.120 --> 2:56:14.120
 You'll basically have a thing

2:56:14.120 --> 2:56:15.840
 which is naturally two dimensional,

2:56:15.840 --> 2:56:18.800
 and you're sort of mapping it into one dimension

2:56:18.800 --> 2:56:20.000
 with a space filling curve.

2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:21.640
 And it's like, why is it this space filling curve

2:56:21.640 --> 2:56:23.360
 and another space filling curve?

2:56:23.360 --> 2:56:26.560
 And that becomes a story about Riemann surfaces and things,

2:56:26.560 --> 2:56:28.160
 and it's quite elaborate.

2:56:29.200 --> 2:56:32.640
 But there's a more, a little bit sleight of hand way

2:56:32.640 --> 2:56:36.680
 of doing it where it's surprisingly direct.

2:56:36.680 --> 2:56:37.520
 It's...

2:56:37.520 --> 2:56:42.520
 So a question that might be difficult to answer,

2:56:42.520 --> 2:56:46.120
 but for several levels of people,

2:56:46.120 --> 2:56:50.360
 could you give me advice on how we can learn more?

2:56:50.360 --> 2:56:54.640
 Specifically, there is people that are completely outside

2:56:54.640 --> 2:56:57.080
 and just curious and are captivated

2:56:57.080 --> 2:57:00.880
 by the beauty of hypergraphs, actually.

2:57:00.880 --> 2:57:04.040
 So people that just wanna explore, play around with this.

2:57:04.040 --> 2:57:09.040
 Second level is people from, say, people like me

2:57:09.040 --> 2:57:12.720
 who somehow got a PhD in computer science,

2:57:12.720 --> 2:57:14.240
 but are not physicists.

2:57:14.240 --> 2:57:16.600
 But fundamentally, the work you're doing

2:57:16.600 --> 2:57:18.720
 is of computational nature.

2:57:18.720 --> 2:57:20.480
 So it feels very accessible.

2:57:20.480 --> 2:57:25.480
 So what can a person like that do to learn enough physics

2:57:27.480 --> 2:57:31.640
 or not to be able to, one, explore the beauty of it,

2:57:31.640 --> 2:57:36.640
 and two, the final level of contribute something

2:57:36.640 --> 2:57:40.280
 of a level of even publishable,

2:57:40.280 --> 2:57:43.240
 like strong, interesting ideas.

2:57:43.240 --> 2:57:46.200
 So at all those layers, complete beginner,

2:57:46.200 --> 2:57:49.560
 a CS person, and the CS person that wants to publish.

2:57:49.560 --> 2:57:53.120
 I mean, I think that, I've written a bunch of stuff,

2:57:53.120 --> 2:57:54.440
 a person called Jonathan Gorod,

2:57:54.440 --> 2:57:56.160
 who's been a key person working on this project,

2:57:56.160 --> 2:57:58.040
 has also written a bunch of stuff.

2:57:58.040 --> 2:58:00.800
 And some other people started writing things too.

2:58:00.800 --> 2:58:02.120
 And he's a physicist.

2:58:02.120 --> 2:58:02.960
 Physicist.

2:58:02.960 --> 2:58:05.240
 Well, he's, I would say, a mathematical physicist.

2:58:05.240 --> 2:58:06.080
 Mathematical.

2:58:06.080 --> 2:58:06.920
 Mathematical physicist.

2:58:06.920 --> 2:58:08.800
 He's pretty mathematically sophisticated.

2:58:08.800 --> 2:58:11.640
 He regularly outmathematicizes me.

2:58:11.640 --> 2:58:14.720
 Yeah, strong mathematical physicist.

2:58:14.720 --> 2:58:16.560
 Yeah, I looked at some of the papers.

2:58:16.560 --> 2:58:19.440
 Right, but so, I mean,

2:58:19.440 --> 2:58:22.440
 I wrote this kind of original announcement blog post

2:58:22.440 --> 2:58:25.480
 about this project, which people seem to have found.

2:58:25.480 --> 2:58:29.000
 I've been really happy, actually, that people who,

2:58:30.880 --> 2:58:34.760
 people seem to have grokked key points from that,

2:58:34.760 --> 2:58:37.400
 much deeper key points, people seem to have grokked

2:58:37.400 --> 2:58:39.520
 than I thought they would grokk.

2:58:39.520 --> 2:58:41.600
 And that's a kind of a long blog post

2:58:41.600 --> 2:58:43.120
 that explains some of the things we talked about,

2:58:43.120 --> 2:58:45.360
 like the hypergraph and the basic rules.

2:58:45.360 --> 2:58:47.920
 And I don't, does it, I forget,

2:58:47.920 --> 2:58:49.880
 it doesn't have any quantum mechanics in here.

2:58:49.880 --> 2:58:51.920
 It does. It does.

2:58:51.920 --> 2:58:54.720
 But we know a little bit more since that blog post

2:58:54.720 --> 2:58:56.480
 that probably clarifies,

2:58:56.480 --> 2:58:59.560
 but that blog post does a pretty decent job.

2:58:59.560 --> 2:59:02.160
 And, you know, talking about things like, again,

2:59:02.160 --> 2:59:03.000
 something we didn't mention,

2:59:03.000 --> 2:59:04.960
 the fact that the uncertainty principle

2:59:04.960 --> 2:59:07.760
 is a consequence of curvature in branchial space.

2:59:07.760 --> 2:59:10.120
 How much physics should a person know

2:59:10.120 --> 2:59:14.480
 to be able to understand the beauty of this framework

2:59:14.480 --> 2:59:16.880
 and to contribute something novel?

2:59:16.880 --> 2:59:20.200
 Okay, so I think that those are different questions.

2:59:20.200 --> 2:59:23.840
 So, I mean, I think that the, why does this work?

2:59:23.840 --> 2:59:25.560
 Why does this make any sense?

2:59:27.440 --> 2:59:28.480
 To really know that,

2:59:28.480 --> 2:59:32.040
 you have to know a fair amount of physics, okay?

2:59:32.040 --> 2:59:33.520
 And for example, have a decent understanding.

2:59:33.520 --> 2:59:35.040
 When you say, why does this work?

2:59:35.040 --> 2:59:38.480
 You're referring to the connection between this model

2:59:38.480 --> 2:59:40.600
 and general relativity, for example.

2:59:40.600 --> 2:59:43.160
 You have to understand something about general relativity.

2:59:43.160 --> 2:59:45.240
 There's also a side of this where just

2:59:45.240 --> 2:59:47.880
 as the pure mathematical framework is fascinating.

2:59:47.880 --> 2:59:48.720
 Yes.

2:59:48.720 --> 2:59:50.360
 If you throw the physics out completely.

2:59:50.360 --> 2:59:52.520
 Then it's quite accessible to, I mean, you know,

2:59:52.520 --> 2:59:55.280
 I wrote this sort of long technical introduction

2:59:55.280 --> 2:59:58.480
 to the project, which seems to have been very accessible

2:59:58.480 --> 3:00:01.400
 to people who are, you know, who understand computation

3:00:01.400 --> 3:00:04.960
 and formal abstract ideas, but are not specialists

3:00:04.960 --> 3:00:07.240
 in physics or other kinds of things.

3:00:07.240 --> 3:00:10.280
 I mean, the thing with the physics part of it is,

3:00:10.280 --> 3:00:14.600
 you know, there's both a way of thinking

3:00:14.600 --> 3:00:16.840
 and literally a mathematical formalism.

3:00:16.840 --> 3:00:18.040
 I mean, it's like, you know,

3:00:18.040 --> 3:00:19.960
 to know that we get the Einstein equations,

3:00:19.960 --> 3:00:22.120
 to know we get the energy momentum tensor,

3:00:22.120 --> 3:00:24.800
 you kind of have to know what the energy momentum tensor is.

3:00:24.800 --> 3:00:25.880
 And that's physics.

3:00:25.880 --> 3:00:29.240
 I mean, that's kind of graduate level physics basically.

3:00:29.240 --> 3:00:33.360
 And so that, you know, making that final connection

3:00:33.360 --> 3:00:37.440
 is requires some depth of physics knowledge.

3:00:37.440 --> 3:00:38.880
 I mean, that's the unfortunate thing,

3:00:38.880 --> 3:00:40.600
 the difference in machine learning and physics

3:00:40.600 --> 3:00:42.880
 in the 21st century.

3:00:42.880 --> 3:00:47.440
 Is it really out of reach of a year or two worth of study?

3:00:47.440 --> 3:00:49.920
 No, you could get it in a year or two,

3:00:49.920 --> 3:00:51.600
 but you can't get it in a month.

3:00:51.600 --> 3:00:52.440
 Right.

3:00:52.440 --> 3:00:53.280
 I mean.

3:00:53.280 --> 3:00:56.160
 So, but it doesn't require necessarily like 15 years.

3:00:56.160 --> 3:00:57.000
 No, it does not.

3:00:57.000 --> 3:01:00.240
 And in fact, a lot of what has happened with this project

3:01:00.240 --> 3:01:02.800
 makes a lot of this stuff much more accessible.

3:01:02.800 --> 3:01:04.800
 There are things where it has been quite difficult

3:01:04.800 --> 3:01:06.040
 to explain what's going on.

3:01:06.040 --> 3:01:09.160
 And it requires much more, you know,

3:01:09.160 --> 3:01:11.840
 having the concreteness of being able to do simulations,

3:01:11.840 --> 3:01:15.160
 knowing that this thing that you might've thought

3:01:15.160 --> 3:01:19.000
 was just an analogy is really actually what's going on,

3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:21.040
 makes one feel much more secure

3:01:21.040 --> 3:01:24.240
 about just sort of saying, this is how this works.

3:01:24.240 --> 3:01:26.240
 And I think it will be, you know,

3:01:26.240 --> 3:01:28.520
 the, I'm hoping the textbooks of the future,

3:01:28.520 --> 3:01:30.480
 the physics textbooks of the future,

3:01:30.480 --> 3:01:32.120
 there will be a certain compression.

3:01:32.120 --> 3:01:33.360
 There will be things that used to be

3:01:33.360 --> 3:01:35.240
 very much more elaborate because for example,

3:01:35.240 --> 3:01:36.720
 even doing continuous mathematics

3:01:36.720 --> 3:01:38.880
 versus this discrete mathematics,

3:01:38.880 --> 3:01:40.680
 that, you know, to know how things work

3:01:40.680 --> 3:01:41.800
 in continuous mathematics,

3:01:41.800 --> 3:01:43.120
 you have to be talking about stuff

3:01:43.120 --> 3:01:44.760
 and waving your hands about things.

3:01:44.760 --> 3:01:47.120
 Whereas with discrete, the discrete version,

3:01:47.120 --> 3:01:49.280
 it's just like, here is a picture.

3:01:49.280 --> 3:01:50.920
 This is how it works.

3:01:50.920 --> 3:01:53.240
 And there's no, oh, do we get the limit right?

3:01:53.240 --> 3:01:55.560
 Did this, you know, did this thing that is of,

3:01:55.560 --> 3:01:59.440
 you know, zero, you know, measure zero object,

3:01:59.440 --> 3:02:01.960
 you know, interact with this thing in the right way.

3:02:01.960 --> 3:02:03.400
 You don't have to have that whole discussion.

3:02:03.400 --> 3:02:05.520
 It's just like, here's a picture, you know,

3:02:05.520 --> 3:02:07.160
 this is what it does.

3:02:07.160 --> 3:02:09.560
 And, you know, you can, then it takes more effort to say,

3:02:09.560 --> 3:02:12.040
 what does it do in the limit when the picture gets very big?

3:02:12.040 --> 3:02:13.120
 But you can do experiments

3:02:13.120 --> 3:02:14.360
 to build up an intuition actually.

3:02:14.360 --> 3:02:15.200
 Yes, right.

3:02:15.200 --> 3:02:17.480
 And you can get sort of core intuition for what's going on.

3:02:17.480 --> 3:02:20.160
 Now, in terms of contributing to this, the, you know,

3:02:20.160 --> 3:02:23.240
 I would say that the study of the computational universe

3:02:23.240 --> 3:02:24.520
 and how all these programs work

3:02:24.520 --> 3:02:26.000
 in the computational universe,

3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:28.760
 there's just an unbelievable amount to do there.

3:02:28.760 --> 3:02:31.320
 And it is very close to the surface.

3:02:31.320 --> 3:02:34.400
 That is, you know, high school kids,

3:02:34.400 --> 3:02:36.080
 you can do experiments.

3:02:36.080 --> 3:02:38.960
 It's not, you know, and you can discover things.

3:02:38.960 --> 3:02:42.600
 I mean, you know, we, you can discover stuff about,

3:02:42.600 --> 3:02:44.320
 I don't know, like this thing about expansion

3:02:44.320 --> 3:02:45.160
 of branchial space.

3:02:45.160 --> 3:02:47.760
 That's an absolutely accessible thing to look at.

3:02:47.760 --> 3:02:50.680
 Now, you know, the main issue with doing these things

3:02:50.680 --> 3:02:55.200
 is not, there isn't a lot of technical depth difficulty

3:02:55.200 --> 3:02:56.040
 there.

3:02:56.040 --> 3:02:58.040
 The actual doing of the experiments, you know,

3:02:58.040 --> 3:03:01.360
 all the code is all on our website to do all these things.

3:03:01.360 --> 3:03:03.880
 The real thing is sort of the judgment

3:03:03.880 --> 3:03:05.600
 of what's the right experiment to do.

3:03:05.600 --> 3:03:07.800
 How do you interpret what you see?

3:03:07.800 --> 3:03:09.920
 That's the part that, you know,

3:03:09.920 --> 3:03:11.840
 people will do amazing things with.

3:03:11.840 --> 3:03:13.520
 And that's the part that, but,

3:03:13.520 --> 3:03:17.040
 but it isn't like you have to have done 10 years of study

3:03:17.040 --> 3:03:18.840
 to get to the point where you can do the experiments.

3:03:18.840 --> 3:03:19.680
 You don't.

3:03:19.680 --> 3:03:21.840
 That's a cool thing you can do experiments day one,

3:03:21.840 --> 3:03:22.680
 basically.

3:03:22.680 --> 3:03:25.040
 That's the amazing thing about,

3:03:25.040 --> 3:03:27.240
 and you've actually put the tools out there.

3:03:27.240 --> 3:03:28.080
 It's beautiful.

3:03:28.080 --> 3:03:29.640
 It's mysterious.

3:03:29.640 --> 3:03:32.720
 There's still, I would say, maybe you can correct me.

3:03:32.720 --> 3:03:36.440
 It feels like there's a huge number of log hanging fruit

3:03:36.440 --> 3:03:39.440
 on the mathematical side, at least not the physics side,

3:03:39.440 --> 3:03:40.280
 perhaps.

3:03:40.280 --> 3:03:42.800
 No, there's, look on the, on the, okay.

3:03:42.800 --> 3:03:45.160
 On the physics side, we are,

3:03:45.160 --> 3:03:48.440
 we're definitely in harvesting mode, you know.

3:03:48.440 --> 3:03:50.960
 Of which, which fruit, the low hanging ones or?

3:03:50.960 --> 3:03:52.560
 The low hanging ones, yeah, right.

3:03:52.560 --> 3:03:54.200
 I mean, basically here's the thing.

3:03:54.200 --> 3:03:56.120
 There's a certain list of, you know,

3:03:56.120 --> 3:03:57.800
 here are the effects in quantum mechanics.

3:03:57.800 --> 3:03:59.760
 Here are the effects in general activity.

3:03:59.760 --> 3:04:02.240
 It's just like industrial harvesting.

3:04:02.240 --> 3:04:04.480
 It's like, can we get this one, this one, this one,

3:04:04.480 --> 3:04:05.560
 this one, this one?

3:04:05.560 --> 3:04:07.560
 And the thing that's really, you know,

3:04:07.560 --> 3:04:10.120
 interesting and satisfying, and it's like, you know,

3:04:10.120 --> 3:04:11.520
 is one climbing the right mountain?

3:04:11.520 --> 3:04:12.920
 Does one have the right model?

3:04:12.920 --> 3:04:15.920
 The thing that's just amazing is, you know,

3:04:15.920 --> 3:04:18.280
 we keep on like, are we going to get this one?

3:04:18.280 --> 3:04:19.920
 How hard is this one?

3:04:19.920 --> 3:04:22.920
 It's like, oh, you know, it looks really hard.

3:04:22.920 --> 3:04:23.800
 It looks really hard.

3:04:23.800 --> 3:04:25.820
 Oh, actually we can get it.

3:04:26.760 --> 3:04:27.600
 And.

3:04:27.600 --> 3:04:29.040
 And you're, you're continually surprised.

3:04:29.040 --> 3:04:31.520
 I mean, it seems like I've been following your progress.

3:04:31.520 --> 3:04:32.520
 It's kind of exciting.

3:04:32.520 --> 3:04:34.320
 All the, in harvesting mode,

3:04:34.320 --> 3:04:35.880
 all the things you're picking up along the way.

3:04:35.880 --> 3:04:36.720
 Right, right.

3:04:36.720 --> 3:04:38.320
 No, I mean, it's, it's the thing that is,

3:04:38.320 --> 3:04:40.200
 I keep on thinking it's going to be more difficult

3:04:40.200 --> 3:04:41.040
 than it is.

3:04:41.040 --> 3:04:43.360
 Now that's a, you know, that's a, who knows what,

3:04:43.360 --> 3:04:45.880
 I mean, the one thing, so the, the, the,

3:04:45.880 --> 3:04:48.640
 the thing that's been a, was a big thing

3:04:48.640 --> 3:04:50.900
 that I think we're, we're pretty close to.

3:04:50.900 --> 3:04:52.480
 I mean, I can give you a little bit of the roadmap.

3:04:52.480 --> 3:04:54.640
 It's sort of interesting to see, it's like,

3:04:54.640 --> 3:04:55.720
 what are particles?

3:04:55.720 --> 3:04:56.880
 What are things like electrons?

3:04:56.880 --> 3:04:58.520
 How do they really work?

3:04:58.520 --> 3:05:01.400
 Are you close to get like, what, what's a,

3:05:01.400 --> 3:05:03.800
 are you close to trying to understand like the atom,

3:05:03.800 --> 3:05:06.480
 the electrons, neutrons, protons?

3:05:06.480 --> 3:05:08.080
 Okay, so this is, this is the stack.

3:05:08.080 --> 3:05:10.600
 So the first thing we want to understand is

3:05:11.680 --> 3:05:13.360
 the quantization of spin.

3:05:13.360 --> 3:05:15.960
 So particles, they, they kind of spin,

3:05:15.960 --> 3:05:18.120
 they have a certain angular momentum,

3:05:18.120 --> 3:05:19.400
 that angular momentum,

3:05:19.400 --> 3:05:22.280
 even though the masses of particles are all over the place,

3:05:22.280 --> 3:05:25.920
 you know, the electron has a mass of 0.511 MeV,

3:05:25.920 --> 3:05:28.760
 but you know, the proton is 938 MeV, et cetera, et cetera,

3:05:28.760 --> 3:05:30.640
 et cetera, they're all kind of random numbers.

3:05:30.640 --> 3:05:32.720
 The, the spins of all these particles

3:05:32.720 --> 3:05:34.880
 are either integers or half integers.

3:05:34.880 --> 3:05:38.440
 And that's a fact that was discovered in the 1920s, I guess.

3:05:38.440 --> 3:05:43.440
 The, I think that we are close to understanding

3:05:44.120 --> 3:05:45.800
 why spin is quantized.

3:05:45.800 --> 3:05:48.280
 And that's a, and it, it appears to be

3:05:48.280 --> 3:05:50.280
 a quite elaborate mathematical story

3:05:50.280 --> 3:05:53.040
 about homotopic groups in twister space

3:05:53.040 --> 3:05:54.400
 and all kinds of things.

3:05:54.400 --> 3:05:58.000
 But bottom line is that seems within reach.

3:05:58.000 --> 3:05:59.200
 And that's, that's a big deal

3:05:59.200 --> 3:06:01.680
 because that's a very core feature of understanding

3:06:01.680 --> 3:06:04.160
 how particles work in quantum mechanics.

3:06:04.160 --> 3:06:07.280
 Another core feature is this difference between particles

3:06:07.280 --> 3:06:10.600
 that obey the exclusion principle and sort of stay apart,

3:06:10.600 --> 3:06:13.680
 that leads to the stability of matter and things like that,

3:06:13.680 --> 3:06:15.360
 and particles that love to get together

3:06:15.360 --> 3:06:18.120
 and be in the same state, things like photons,

3:06:18.120 --> 3:06:22.160
 that, and that's what leads to phenomena like lasers,

3:06:22.160 --> 3:06:23.800
 where you can get sort of coherently

3:06:23.800 --> 3:06:25.280
 everything in the same state.

3:06:25.280 --> 3:06:29.240
 That difference is the particles of integer spin

3:06:29.240 --> 3:06:31.760
 are bosons like to get together in the same state,

3:06:31.760 --> 3:06:34.440
 the particles of half integer spin are fermions,

3:06:34.440 --> 3:06:37.520
 like electrons that they tend to stay apart.

3:06:37.520 --> 3:06:41.800
 And so the question is, can we get that in our models?

3:06:41.800 --> 3:06:45.400
 And, oh, just the last few days, I think we made,

3:06:45.400 --> 3:06:47.920
 I mean, I think the story of,

3:06:47.920 --> 3:06:51.400
 I mean, it's one of these things where we're really close.

3:06:51.400 --> 3:06:53.680
 Is this connected fermions and bosons?

3:06:53.680 --> 3:06:54.520
 Yeah, yeah.

3:06:54.520 --> 3:06:57.720
 So this was what happens is what seems to happen, okay?

3:06:57.720 --> 3:07:01.440
 It's, you know, subject to revision in the next few days.

3:07:01.440 --> 3:07:04.200
 But what seems to be the case is that

3:07:04.200 --> 3:07:06.360
 bosons are associated with essentially

3:07:06.360 --> 3:07:08.400
 merging in multiway graphs,

3:07:08.400 --> 3:07:10.440
 and fermions are associated with branching

3:07:10.440 --> 3:07:11.920
 in multiway graphs.

3:07:11.920 --> 3:07:15.120
 And that essentially the exclusion principle

3:07:15.120 --> 3:07:18.320
 is the fact that in branchial space,

3:07:18.320 --> 3:07:21.360
 things have a certain extent in branchial space

3:07:21.360 --> 3:07:24.000
 that in which things are being sort of forced apart

3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:26.280
 in branchial space, whereas the case of bosons,

3:07:26.280 --> 3:07:29.400
 they get, they come together in branchial space.

3:07:29.400 --> 3:07:32.360
 And the real question is, can we explain the relationship

3:07:32.360 --> 3:07:34.520
 between that and these things called spinners,

3:07:34.520 --> 3:07:37.440
 which are the representation of half integer spin particles

3:07:37.440 --> 3:07:39.320
 that have this weird feature that usually when you go

3:07:39.320 --> 3:07:41.520
 around 360 degree rotation,

3:07:41.520 --> 3:07:43.400
 you get back to where you started from.

3:07:43.400 --> 3:07:44.760
 But for a spinner, you don't get back

3:07:44.760 --> 3:07:46.040
 to where you started from.

3:07:46.040 --> 3:07:48.800
 It takes 720 degrees of rotation to get back

3:07:48.800 --> 3:07:50.240
 to where you started from.

3:07:50.240 --> 3:07:53.160
 And we are just, it feels like we are,

3:07:53.160 --> 3:07:55.440
 we're just incredibly close to actually having that,

3:07:55.440 --> 3:07:57.160
 understanding how that works.

3:07:57.160 --> 3:07:59.000
 And it turns out, it looks like,

3:07:59.000 --> 3:08:01.640
 my current speculation is that it's as simple

3:08:01.640 --> 3:08:06.640
 as the directed hypergraphs versus undirected hypergraphs,

3:08:07.760 --> 3:08:10.240
 the relationship between spinners and vectors.

3:08:10.240 --> 3:08:11.800
 So, which is just interesting.

3:08:11.800 --> 3:08:13.840
 Yeah, that would be interesting if these are all these kind

3:08:13.840 --> 3:08:18.600
 of nice properties of this multi way graphs of branching

3:08:18.600 --> 3:08:19.920
 and rejoining.

3:08:19.920 --> 3:08:21.760
 Spinners have been very mysterious.

3:08:21.760 --> 3:08:23.880
 And if that's what they turn out to be,

3:08:23.880 --> 3:08:25.240
 there's going to be an easy explanation

3:08:25.240 --> 3:08:26.080
 of what's going on.

3:08:26.080 --> 3:08:27.160
 Directive versus undirective.

3:08:27.160 --> 3:08:30.600
 It's just, and that's why there's only two different cases.

3:08:30.600 --> 3:08:34.160
 It's why are spinners important in quantum mechanics?

3:08:34.160 --> 3:08:35.680
 Can you just give a...

3:08:35.680 --> 3:08:39.040
 Yeah, so spinners are important because they are,

3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:41.480
 they're the representation of electrons

3:08:41.480 --> 3:08:43.400
 which have half an inch of spin.

3:08:43.400 --> 3:08:48.320
 They are, the wave functions of electrons are spinners.

3:08:48.320 --> 3:08:51.280
 Just like the wave functions of photons are vectors,

3:08:51.280 --> 3:08:54.280
 the wave functions of electrons are spinners.

3:08:54.280 --> 3:08:58.040
 And they have this property that when you rotate

3:08:58.040 --> 3:09:02.880
 by 360 degrees, they come back to minus one of themselves

3:09:02.880 --> 3:09:06.760
 and take 720 degrees to get back to the original value.

3:09:06.760 --> 3:09:08.560
 And they are a consequence of,

3:09:10.640 --> 3:09:15.160
 we usually think of rotation in space as being,

3:09:15.160 --> 3:09:18.720
 when you have this notion of rotational invariance

3:09:18.720 --> 3:09:22.160
 and rotational invariance, as we ordinarily experience it,

3:09:22.160 --> 3:09:23.280
 doesn't have the feature.

3:09:23.280 --> 3:09:24.760
 If you go through 360 degrees,

3:09:24.760 --> 3:09:26.440
 you go back to where you started from,

3:09:26.440 --> 3:09:28.480
 but that's not true for electrons.

3:09:28.480 --> 3:09:32.480
 And so that's why understanding how that works is important.

3:09:32.480 --> 3:09:34.920
 Yeah, I've been playing with Mobius Strip

3:09:34.920 --> 3:09:37.000
 quite a bit lately, just for fun.

3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:37.840
 Yes, yes.

3:09:37.840 --> 3:09:41.000
 It adds some funk, it has the same kind of funky properties.

3:09:41.000 --> 3:09:41.840
 Yes, right, exactly.

3:09:41.840 --> 3:09:43.560
 You can have this so called belt trick,

3:09:43.560 --> 3:09:45.960
 which is this way of taking an extended object

3:09:45.960 --> 3:09:47.600
 and you can see properties like spinners

3:09:47.600 --> 3:09:50.200
 with that kind of extended object that...

3:09:50.200 --> 3:09:51.720
 Yeah, it would be very cool if there's,

3:09:51.720 --> 3:09:53.840
 it somehow connects the directive versus undirective.

3:09:53.840 --> 3:09:54.680
 I think that's what it's gonna be.

3:09:54.680 --> 3:09:57.480
 I think it's gonna be as simple as that, but we'll see.

3:09:57.480 --> 3:09:59.680
 I mean, this is the thing that,

3:09:59.680 --> 3:10:03.200
 this is the big sort of bizarre surprise is that,

3:10:03.200 --> 3:10:07.720
 because I learned physics as probably, let's say,

3:10:07.720 --> 3:10:10.080
 let's say a fifth generation in the sense that,

3:10:10.080 --> 3:10:11.960
 if you go back to the 1920s and so on,

3:10:11.960 --> 3:10:13.720
 there were the people who were originating

3:10:13.720 --> 3:10:15.400
 quantum mechanics and so on.

3:10:15.400 --> 3:10:16.280
 Maybe it's a little less than that.

3:10:16.280 --> 3:10:19.760
 Maybe I was like a third generation or something.

3:10:19.760 --> 3:10:23.560
 I don't know, but the people from whom I learned physics

3:10:23.560 --> 3:10:26.760
 were the people who had been students of the students

3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:28.920
 of the people who originated

3:10:28.920 --> 3:10:31.240
 the current understanding of physics.

3:10:31.240 --> 3:10:33.920
 And we're now at probably the seventh generation

3:10:33.920 --> 3:10:35.080
 of physicists or something

3:10:35.080 --> 3:10:38.320
 from the early days of 20th century physics.

3:10:38.320 --> 3:10:43.320
 And whenever a field gets that many generations deep,

3:10:43.360 --> 3:10:46.640
 it seems the foundations seem quite inaccessible.

3:10:46.640 --> 3:10:48.160
 And they seem, it seems like

3:10:48.160 --> 3:10:49.800
 you can't possibly understand that.

3:10:49.800 --> 3:10:52.720
 We've gone through seven academic generations

3:10:52.720 --> 3:10:55.320
 and that's been, you know, that's been this thing

3:10:55.320 --> 3:10:58.600
 that's been difficult to understand for that long.

3:10:58.600 --> 3:11:00.200
 It just can't be that simple.

3:11:01.240 --> 3:11:03.800
 But in a sense, maybe that journey takes you

3:11:03.800 --> 3:11:07.640
 to a simple explanation that was there all along.

3:11:07.640 --> 3:11:08.480
 That's the whole. Right, right, right.

3:11:08.480 --> 3:11:10.640
 I mean, you know, and the thing for me personally,

3:11:10.640 --> 3:11:13.200
 the thing that's been quite interesting is, you know,

3:11:13.200 --> 3:11:16.200
 I didn't expect this project to work in this way.

3:11:16.200 --> 3:11:19.080
 And I, you know, but I had this sort of weird piece

3:11:19.080 --> 3:11:21.840
 of personal history that I used to be a physicist

3:11:21.840 --> 3:11:23.040
 and I used to do all this stuff.

3:11:23.040 --> 3:11:26.880
 And I know, you know, the standard canon of physics,

3:11:26.880 --> 3:11:28.760
 I knew it very well.

3:11:28.760 --> 3:11:31.280
 And, you know, but then I'd been working

3:11:31.280 --> 3:11:33.000
 on this kind of computational paradigm

3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:35.120
 for basically 40 years.

3:11:35.120 --> 3:11:38.800
 And the fact that, you know, I'm sort of now coming back

3:11:38.800 --> 3:11:42.240
 to, you know, trying to apply that in physics,

3:11:42.240 --> 3:11:44.920
 it kind of felt like that journey was necessary.

3:11:44.920 --> 3:11:49.040
 Was this, when did you first try to play with a hypergraph?

3:11:49.040 --> 3:11:50.520
 So what happened is,

3:11:50.520 --> 3:11:53.320
 yeah, so what I had was, okay, so this is again,

3:11:53.320 --> 3:11:56.320
 you know, one always feels dumb after the fact.

3:11:56.320 --> 3:11:58.800
 It's obvious after the fact.

3:11:58.800 --> 3:12:02.240
 But so back in the early 1990s,

3:12:02.240 --> 3:12:05.240
 I realized that using graphs

3:12:05.240 --> 3:12:07.760
 as a sort of underlying thing underneath space and time

3:12:07.760 --> 3:12:09.720
 was going to be a useful thing to do.

3:12:09.720 --> 3:12:12.760
 I figured out about multiway systems.

3:12:12.760 --> 3:12:14.960
 I figured out the things about general relativity

3:12:14.960 --> 3:12:17.400
 I'd figured out by the end of the 1990s.

3:12:17.400 --> 3:12:20.040
 But I always felt there was a certain inelegance

3:12:20.040 --> 3:12:21.880
 because I was using these graphs

3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:23.880
 and there were certain constraints on these graphs

3:12:23.880 --> 3:12:26.440
 that seemed like they were kind of awkward.

3:12:26.440 --> 3:12:28.320
 It was kind of like, you can pick,

3:12:28.320 --> 3:12:30.240
 it's like you couldn't pick any rule.

3:12:30.240 --> 3:12:33.360
 It was like pick any number, but the number has to be prime.

3:12:33.360 --> 3:12:34.600
 It was kind of like you couldn't,

3:12:34.600 --> 3:12:36.920
 it was kind of an awkward special constraint.

3:12:36.920 --> 3:12:38.400
 I had these trivalent graphs,

3:12:38.400 --> 3:12:41.440
 graphs with just three connections from every node.

3:12:41.440 --> 3:12:44.280
 Okay, so, but I discovered a bunch of stuff with that.

3:12:44.280 --> 3:12:46.280
 And I thought it was kind of inelegant.

3:12:46.280 --> 3:12:48.680
 And, you know, the other piece of sort of personal history

3:12:48.680 --> 3:12:50.160
 is obviously I spent my life

3:12:50.160 --> 3:12:52.960
 as a computational language designer.

3:12:52.960 --> 3:12:55.160
 And so the story of computational language design

3:12:55.160 --> 3:12:58.000
 is a story of how do you take all these random ideas

3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:00.720
 in the world and kind of grind them down

3:13:00.720 --> 3:13:02.720
 into something that is computationally

3:13:02.720 --> 3:13:04.760
 as simple as possible.

3:13:04.760 --> 3:13:06.680
 And so, you know, I've been very interested

3:13:06.680 --> 3:13:09.280
 in kind of simple computational frameworks

3:13:09.280 --> 3:13:12.600
 for representing things and have, you know,

3:13:12.600 --> 3:13:15.800
 ridiculous amounts of experience in trying to do that.

3:13:15.800 --> 3:13:18.280
 And actually all of those trajectories of your life

3:13:18.280 --> 3:13:19.320
 kind of came together.

3:13:19.320 --> 3:13:21.600
 So you make it sound like you could have come up

3:13:21.600 --> 3:13:24.640
 with everything you're working on now decades ago,

3:13:24.640 --> 3:13:26.440
 but in reality.

3:13:26.440 --> 3:13:28.080
 Look, two things slowed me down.

3:13:28.080 --> 3:13:30.280
 I mean, one thing that slowed me down was

3:13:30.280 --> 3:13:32.840
 I couldn't figure out how to make it elegant.

3:13:32.840 --> 3:13:35.600
 And that turns out hypergraphs were the key to that.

3:13:35.600 --> 3:13:39.160
 And that I figured out about less than two years ago now.

3:13:40.160 --> 3:13:43.360
 And the other, I mean, I think,

3:13:43.360 --> 3:13:46.160
 so that was sort of a key thing.

3:13:46.160 --> 3:13:49.760
 Well, okay, so the real embarrassment of this project, okay,

3:13:49.760 --> 3:13:52.680
 is that the final structure that we have

3:13:52.680 --> 3:13:55.840
 that is the foundation for this project

3:13:55.840 --> 3:14:00.000
 is basically a kind of an idealized version,

3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:03.560
 a formalized version of the exact same structure

3:14:03.560 --> 3:14:05.640
 that I've used to build computational languages

3:14:05.640 --> 3:14:07.160
 for more than 40 years.

3:14:07.160 --> 3:14:09.840
 But it took me, but I didn't realize that.

3:14:09.840 --> 3:14:11.280
 And, you know.

3:14:11.280 --> 3:14:12.840
 And there yet may be others.

3:14:12.840 --> 3:14:14.360
 So we're focused on physics now,

3:14:14.360 --> 3:14:17.720
 but I mean, that's what the new kind of science was about.

3:14:17.720 --> 3:14:19.120
 Same kind of stuff.

3:14:19.120 --> 3:14:21.720
 And this, in terms of mathematically,

3:14:21.720 --> 3:14:22.960
 well, the beauty of it.

3:14:22.960 --> 3:14:26.160
 So there could be entire other kind of objects

3:14:26.160 --> 3:14:27.600
 that are useful for,

3:14:27.600 --> 3:14:29.760
 like we're not talking about, you know,

3:14:29.760 --> 3:14:31.760
 machine learning, for example.

3:14:31.760 --> 3:14:33.880
 Maybe there's other variants of the hypergraph

3:14:33.880 --> 3:14:35.720
 that are very useful for reasoning.

3:14:35.720 --> 3:14:37.440
 Well, we'll see whether the multiway graph

3:14:37.440 --> 3:14:40.320
 or machine learning system is interesting.

3:14:40.320 --> 3:14:41.480
 Okay.

3:14:41.480 --> 3:14:42.320
 Let's leave it at that.

3:14:42.320 --> 3:14:43.640
 That's conversation number three.

3:14:43.640 --> 3:14:46.480
 That's, we're not gonna go there right now, but.

3:14:47.440 --> 3:14:49.040
 One of the things you've mentioned

3:14:49.040 --> 3:14:52.640
 is the space of all possible rules

3:14:52.640 --> 3:14:55.200
 that we kind of discussed a little bit.

3:14:55.200 --> 3:14:58.000
 That, you know, that could be, I guess,

3:14:58.000 --> 3:14:59.880
 the set of possible rules is infinite.

3:15:00.800 --> 3:15:01.640
 Right.

3:15:01.640 --> 3:15:04.200
 Well, so here's the big sort of one of the conundrums

3:15:04.200 --> 3:15:07.840
 that I'm kind of trying to deal with is,

3:15:07.840 --> 3:15:11.720
 let's say we think we found the rule for the universe

3:15:11.720 --> 3:15:13.160
 and we say, here it is.

3:15:13.160 --> 3:15:14.200
 You know, write it down.

3:15:14.200 --> 3:15:15.800
 It's a little tiny thing.

3:15:15.800 --> 3:15:18.000
 And then we say, gosh, that's really weird.

3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:19.680
 Why did we get that one?

3:15:20.640 --> 3:15:21.480
 Right.

3:15:21.480 --> 3:15:23.240
 And then we're in this whole situation

3:15:23.240 --> 3:15:25.480
 because let's say it's fairly simple.

3:15:25.480 --> 3:15:27.680
 How did we come up the winners

3:15:27.680 --> 3:15:30.400
 getting one of the simple possible universe rules?

3:15:30.400 --> 3:15:33.600
 Why didn't we get what some incredibly complicated rule?

3:15:33.600 --> 3:15:34.880
 Why do we get one of the simpler ones?

3:15:34.880 --> 3:15:36.560
 And that's a thing which, you know,

3:15:36.560 --> 3:15:38.800
 in the history of science, you know,

3:15:38.800 --> 3:15:42.680
 the whole sort of story of Copernicus and so on was,

3:15:42.680 --> 3:15:43.920
 you know, we used to think the earth

3:15:43.920 --> 3:15:44.960
 was the center of the universe,

3:15:44.960 --> 3:15:46.320
 but now we find out it's not.

3:15:46.320 --> 3:15:47.760
 And we're actually just in some, you know,

3:15:47.760 --> 3:15:50.480
 random corner of some random galaxy

3:15:50.480 --> 3:15:53.800
 out in this big universe, there's nothing special about us.

3:15:53.800 --> 3:15:58.120
 So if we get, you know, universe number 317

3:15:58.120 --> 3:16:00.400
 out of all the infinite number of possibilities,

3:16:00.400 --> 3:16:02.720
 how do we get something that small and simple?

3:16:02.720 --> 3:16:05.040
 Right, so I was very confused by this.

3:16:05.040 --> 3:16:06.720
 And it's like, what are we going to say about this?

3:16:06.720 --> 3:16:08.560
 How are we going to explain this?

3:16:08.560 --> 3:16:10.320
 And I thought it was, might be one of these things

3:16:10.320 --> 3:16:13.320
 where you just, you know, you can get it to the threshold,

3:16:13.320 --> 3:16:15.480
 and then you find out its rule number, such and such,

3:16:15.480 --> 3:16:17.760
 and you just have no idea why it's like that.

3:16:17.760 --> 3:16:19.120
 Okay, so then I realized

3:16:20.040 --> 3:16:22.560
 it's actually more bizarre than that, okay?

3:16:22.560 --> 3:16:25.040
 So we talked about multiway graphs.

3:16:25.040 --> 3:16:26.760
 We talked about this idea that

3:16:26.760 --> 3:16:29.040
 you take these underlying transformation rules

3:16:29.040 --> 3:16:31.840
 on these hypergraphs, and you apply them

3:16:31.840 --> 3:16:34.720
 wherever the rule can apply, you apply it.

3:16:34.720 --> 3:16:37.680
 And that makes this whole multiway graph of possibilities.

3:16:37.680 --> 3:16:39.960
 Okay, so let's go a little bit weirder.

3:16:39.960 --> 3:16:42.800
 Let's say that at every place,

3:16:42.800 --> 3:16:45.240
 not only do you apply a particular rule

3:16:45.240 --> 3:16:47.160
 in all possible ways it can apply,

3:16:47.160 --> 3:16:49.520
 but you apply all possible rules

3:16:49.520 --> 3:16:51.920
 in all possible ways they can apply.

3:16:51.920 --> 3:16:53.760
 As you say, that's just crazy.

3:16:53.760 --> 3:16:54.920
 That's way too complicated.

3:16:54.920 --> 3:16:57.240
 You're never going to be able to conclude anything.

3:16:57.240 --> 3:17:00.800
 Okay, however, turns out that...

3:17:00.800 --> 3:17:02.880
 Don't tell me there's some kind of invariance.

3:17:02.880 --> 3:17:04.000
 Yeah, yeah.

3:17:04.000 --> 3:17:06.440
 So what happens is...

3:17:06.440 --> 3:17:08.080
 And that would be amazing.

3:17:08.080 --> 3:17:11.240
 Right, so this thing that you get

3:17:11.240 --> 3:17:13.360
 is this kind of ruleal multiway graph,

3:17:13.360 --> 3:17:15.880
 this multiway graph that is a branching of rules

3:17:15.880 --> 3:17:19.760
 as well as a branching of possible applications of rules.

3:17:19.760 --> 3:17:22.080
 This thing has causal invariance.

3:17:22.080 --> 3:17:25.320
 It's an inevitable feature that it shows causal invariance.

3:17:25.320 --> 3:17:28.640
 And that means that you can take different reference frames,

3:17:28.640 --> 3:17:30.920
 different ways of slicing this thing,

3:17:30.920 --> 3:17:33.920
 and they will all in some sense be equivalent.

3:17:33.920 --> 3:17:37.360
 If you make the right translation, they will be equivalent.

3:17:37.360 --> 3:17:40.360
 So, okay, so the basic point here is...

3:17:40.360 --> 3:17:43.040
 If that's true, that would be beautiful.

3:17:43.040 --> 3:17:45.640
 It is true, and it is beautiful.

3:17:45.640 --> 3:17:47.480
 It's not just an intuition, there is some...

3:17:47.480 --> 3:17:50.120
 No, no, no, there's real mathematics behind this,

3:17:50.120 --> 3:17:53.360
 and it is...

3:17:53.360 --> 3:17:55.160
 Okay, so here's where it comes in.

3:17:55.160 --> 3:17:57.360
 Yeah, that's amazing.

3:17:57.360 --> 3:17:58.800
 Right, so by the way, I mean,

3:17:58.800 --> 3:18:00.240
 the mathematics it's connected to

3:18:00.240 --> 3:18:02.360
 is the mathematics of higher category theory

3:18:02.360 --> 3:18:04.240
 and group voids and things like this,

3:18:04.240 --> 3:18:05.880
 which I've always been afraid of,

3:18:05.880 --> 3:18:09.960
 but now I'm finally wrapping my arms around it.

3:18:09.960 --> 3:18:13.120
 But it's also related to...

3:18:13.120 --> 3:18:16.160
 It also relates to computational complexity theory.

3:18:16.160 --> 3:18:19.200
 It's also deeply related to the P versus NP problem

3:18:19.200 --> 3:18:20.440
 and other things like this.

3:18:20.440 --> 3:18:21.880
 Again, it seems completely bizarre

3:18:21.880 --> 3:18:22.960
 that these things are connected,

3:18:22.960 --> 3:18:25.160
 but here's why it's connected.

3:18:25.160 --> 3:18:28.000
 This space of all possible...

3:18:28.000 --> 3:18:32.080
 Okay, so a Turing machine, very simple model of computation.

3:18:32.080 --> 3:18:34.280
 You know, you just got this tape

3:18:34.280 --> 3:18:36.480
 where you write down, you know, ones and zeros

3:18:36.480 --> 3:18:37.400
 or something on the tape,

3:18:37.400 --> 3:18:40.120
 and you have this rule that says, you know,

3:18:40.120 --> 3:18:41.520
 you change the number,

3:18:41.520 --> 3:18:44.320
 you move the head on the tape, et cetera.

3:18:44.320 --> 3:18:46.040
 You have a definite rule for doing that.

3:18:46.040 --> 3:18:47.880
 A deterministic Turing machine

3:18:47.880 --> 3:18:50.000
 just does that deterministically.

3:18:50.000 --> 3:18:51.760
 Given the configuration of the tape,

3:18:51.760 --> 3:18:53.600
 it will always do the same thing.

3:18:53.600 --> 3:18:55.760
 A non deterministic Turing machine

3:18:55.760 --> 3:18:58.960
 can have different choices that it makes at every step.

3:18:58.960 --> 3:19:01.840
 And so, you know, you know this stuff,

3:19:01.840 --> 3:19:04.440
 you probably teach this stuff.

3:19:04.440 --> 3:19:09.200
 It, you know, so a non deterministic Turing machine

3:19:09.200 --> 3:19:11.680
 has the set of branching possibilities,

3:19:11.680 --> 3:19:14.360
 which is in fact, one of these multiway graphs.

3:19:14.360 --> 3:19:16.240
 And in fact, if you say,

3:19:16.240 --> 3:19:19.520
 imagine the extremely non deterministic Turing machine,

3:19:19.520 --> 3:19:22.560
 the Turing machine that can just do,

3:19:22.560 --> 3:19:25.440
 that takes any possible rule at each step,

3:19:25.440 --> 3:19:27.520
 that is this real multiway graph.

3:19:27.520 --> 3:19:31.280
 The set of possible histories

3:19:31.280 --> 3:19:33.720
 of that extreme non deterministic Turing machine

3:19:33.720 --> 3:19:35.880
 is a Rulio multiway graph.

3:19:35.880 --> 3:19:37.680
 And you're, what term are you using?

3:19:37.680 --> 3:19:38.520
 Rulio?

3:19:38.520 --> 3:19:39.360
 Rulio.

3:19:39.360 --> 3:19:40.200
 Rulio, I like it.

3:19:40.200 --> 3:19:41.040
 It's a weird word.

3:19:41.040 --> 3:19:41.880
 Yeah, it's a weird word, right?

3:19:41.880 --> 3:19:44.160
 Rulio multiway graph.

3:19:44.160 --> 3:19:45.880
 Okay, so this, so that.

3:19:45.880 --> 3:19:47.560
 I'm trying to think of,

3:19:48.880 --> 3:19:51.800
 I'm trying to think of the space of rules.

3:19:51.800 --> 3:19:54.240
 So these are basic transformations.

3:19:54.240 --> 3:19:55.760
 So in a Turing machine,

3:19:55.760 --> 3:19:58.280
 it's like it says, move left, move, you know,

3:19:58.280 --> 3:20:02.320
 if it's a one, if it's a black square under the head,

3:20:02.320 --> 3:20:04.840
 move left and right to green square.

3:20:04.840 --> 3:20:05.720
 That's a rule.

3:20:05.720 --> 3:20:06.720
 That's a very basic rule,

3:20:06.720 --> 3:20:09.880
 but I'm trying to see the rules on the hypergraphs,

3:20:09.880 --> 3:20:12.200
 how rich of the programs can they be?

3:20:12.200 --> 3:20:15.520
 Or do they all ultimately just map into something simple?

3:20:15.520 --> 3:20:18.000
 Yeah, they're all, I mean, hypergraphs,

3:20:18.000 --> 3:20:20.200
 that's another layer of complexity on this whole thing.

3:20:20.200 --> 3:20:23.040
 You can think about these in transformations of hypergraphs,

3:20:23.040 --> 3:20:24.360
 but Turing machines are a little bit simpler.

3:20:24.360 --> 3:20:25.600
 You just think of it Turing machines, okay.

3:20:25.600 --> 3:20:27.280
 Right, they're a little bit simpler.

3:20:27.280 --> 3:20:29.120
 So if you look at these extreme

3:20:29.120 --> 3:20:30.920
 non deterministic Turing machines,

3:20:30.920 --> 3:20:35.120
 you're mapping out all the possible non deterministic paths

3:20:35.120 --> 3:20:37.160
 that the Turing machine can follow.

3:20:37.160 --> 3:20:41.040
 And if you ask the question, can you reach, okay,

3:20:41.040 --> 3:20:44.800
 so a deterministic Turing machine follows a single path.

3:20:44.800 --> 3:20:46.960
 The non deterministic Turing machine fills out

3:20:46.960 --> 3:20:50.680
 this whole sort of ball of possibilities.

3:20:50.680 --> 3:20:53.280
 And so then the P versus MP problem

3:20:53.280 --> 3:20:55.160
 ends up being questions about,

3:20:55.160 --> 3:20:56.760
 and we haven't completely figured out

3:20:56.760 --> 3:20:57.600
 all the details of this,

3:20:57.600 --> 3:20:59.920
 but it's basically has to do with questions

3:20:59.920 --> 3:21:03.320
 about the growth of that ball relative

3:21:03.320 --> 3:21:05.800
 to what happens with individual paths and so on.

3:21:05.800 --> 3:21:07.800
 So essentially there's a geometrization

3:21:07.800 --> 3:21:10.120
 of the P versus MP problem that comes out of this.

3:21:10.120 --> 3:21:12.000
 That's a sideshow, okay.

3:21:12.000 --> 3:21:14.960
 The main event here is the statement

3:21:14.960 --> 3:21:19.960
 that you can look at this multiway graph

3:21:19.960 --> 3:21:21.800
 where the branches correspond

3:21:21.800 --> 3:21:24.200
 not just to different applications of a single rule,

3:21:24.200 --> 3:21:28.200
 but to different applications of different rules, okay.

3:21:28.200 --> 3:21:31.960
 And that then that when you say,

3:21:31.960 --> 3:21:35.440
 I'm going to be an observer embedded in that system

3:21:35.440 --> 3:21:36.960
 and I'm going to try and make sense

3:21:36.960 --> 3:21:38.760
 of what's going on in the system.

3:21:38.760 --> 3:21:43.040
 And to do that, I essentially am picking a reference frame

3:21:43.040 --> 3:21:46.560
 and that turns out to be, well, okay.

3:21:46.560 --> 3:21:48.600
 So the way this comes out essentially

3:21:48.600 --> 3:21:50.720
 is the reference frame you pick

3:21:50.720 --> 3:21:53.800
 is the rule that you infer is what's going on

3:21:53.800 --> 3:21:57.440
 in the universe, even though all possible rules

3:21:57.440 --> 3:22:01.240
 are being run, although all those possible rules

3:22:01.240 --> 3:22:02.720
 are in a sense giving the same answer

3:22:02.720 --> 3:22:04.560
 because of causal invariance.

3:22:04.560 --> 3:22:08.480
 But what you see could be completely different.

3:22:08.480 --> 3:22:10.360
 If you pick different reference frames,

3:22:10.360 --> 3:22:12.920
 you essentially have a different description language

3:22:12.920 --> 3:22:14.960
 for describing the universe.

3:22:14.960 --> 3:22:17.320
 Okay, so what does this really mean in practice?

3:22:17.320 --> 3:22:19.640
 So imagine there's us.

3:22:19.640 --> 3:22:22.280
 We think about the universe in terms of space and time

3:22:22.280 --> 3:22:25.000
 and we have various kinds of description models and so on.

3:22:25.000 --> 3:22:29.040
 Now let's imagine the friendly aliens, for example, right?

3:22:29.040 --> 3:22:31.320
 How do they describe their universe?

3:22:31.320 --> 3:22:33.440
 Well, you know, our description of the universe

3:22:33.440 --> 3:22:36.160
 probably is affected by the fact that, you know,

3:22:36.160 --> 3:22:37.920
 we are about the size we are, you know,

3:22:37.920 --> 3:22:40.240
 a meter ish tall, so to speak.

3:22:40.240 --> 3:22:41.840
 We have brain processing speeds,

3:22:41.840 --> 3:22:43.680
 we're about the speeds we have.

3:22:43.680 --> 3:22:46.320
 We're not the size of planets, for example,

3:22:46.320 --> 3:22:48.600
 where the speed of light really would matter.

3:22:48.600 --> 3:22:50.040
 You know, in our everyday life,

3:22:50.040 --> 3:22:51.800
 the speed of light doesn't really matter.

3:22:51.800 --> 3:22:52.920
 Everything can be, you know,

3:22:52.920 --> 3:22:55.200
 the fact that the speed of light is finite is irrelevant.

3:22:55.200 --> 3:22:56.720
 It could as well be infinite.

3:22:56.720 --> 3:22:58.480
 We wouldn't make any difference.

3:22:58.480 --> 3:23:01.240
 You know, it affects the ping times on the internet.

3:23:01.240 --> 3:23:06.040
 That's about the level of how we notice the speed of light.

3:23:06.040 --> 3:23:07.400
 In our sort of everyday existence,

3:23:07.400 --> 3:23:09.360
 we don't really notice it.

3:23:09.360 --> 3:23:12.240
 And so we have a way of describing the universe

3:23:12.240 --> 3:23:16.040
 that's based on our sensory, you know, our senses,

3:23:17.240 --> 3:23:19.760
 these days also on the mathematics we've constructed

3:23:19.760 --> 3:23:22.520
 and so on, but the realization is

3:23:22.520 --> 3:23:24.160
 it's not the only way to do it.

3:23:24.160 --> 3:23:28.200
 There will be completely, utterly incoherent descriptions

3:23:28.200 --> 3:23:30.840
 of the universe, which correspond

3:23:30.840 --> 3:23:34.240
 to different reference frames in this sort of ruleal space.

3:23:34.240 --> 3:23:36.080
 In the ruleal space, that's fascinating.

3:23:36.080 --> 3:23:38.200
 So we have some kind of reference frame

3:23:38.200 --> 3:23:40.720
 in this ruleal space, and from that.

3:23:41.680 --> 3:23:45.600
 That's why we are attributing this rule to the universe.

3:23:45.600 --> 3:23:47.320
 So in other words, when we say,

3:23:47.320 --> 3:23:49.440
 why is it this rule and not another,

3:23:49.440 --> 3:23:52.280
 the answer is just, you know,

3:23:52.280 --> 3:23:54.600
 shine the light back on us, so to speak.

3:23:54.600 --> 3:23:57.240
 It's because of the reference frame that we've picked

3:23:57.240 --> 3:23:58.960
 in our way of understanding what's happening

3:23:58.960 --> 3:24:02.320
 in this sort of space of all possible rules and so on.

3:24:02.320 --> 3:24:05.160
 But also in the space from this reference frame,

3:24:06.120 --> 3:24:11.120
 because of the ruleal, the invariance,

3:24:12.200 --> 3:24:17.200
 that simple, that the rule on which the universe,

3:24:17.200 --> 3:24:19.840
 with which you can run the universe,

3:24:19.840 --> 3:24:21.360
 might as well be simple.

3:24:21.360 --> 3:24:23.720
 Yes, yes, but okay, so here's another point.

3:24:23.720 --> 3:24:26.800
 So this is, again, these are a little bit mind twisting

3:24:26.800 --> 3:24:31.400
 in some ways, but the, okay, another thing that's sort of,

3:24:31.400 --> 3:24:34.640
 we know from computation is this idea

3:24:34.640 --> 3:24:36.480
 of computation universality.

3:24:36.480 --> 3:24:38.880
 The fact that given that we have a program

3:24:38.880 --> 3:24:42.320
 that runs on one kind of computer, we can as well,

3:24:42.320 --> 3:24:44.280
 you know, we can convert it to run

3:24:44.280 --> 3:24:45.380
 on any other kind of computer.

3:24:45.380 --> 3:24:47.880
 We can emulate one kind of computer with another.

3:24:47.880 --> 3:24:50.640
 So that might lead you to say, well,

3:24:50.640 --> 3:24:52.800
 you think you have the rule for the universe,

3:24:52.800 --> 3:24:54.840
 but you might as well be running it on a Turing machine

3:24:54.840 --> 3:24:59.000
 because we know we can emulate any computational rule

3:24:59.000 --> 3:25:00.920
 on any kind of machine.

3:25:00.920 --> 3:25:02.300
 And that's essentially the same thing

3:25:02.300 --> 3:25:03.680
 that's being said here.

3:25:03.680 --> 3:25:07.320
 That is that what we're doing is we're saying

3:25:07.320 --> 3:25:11.280
 these different interpretations of physics correspond

3:25:11.280 --> 3:25:13.400
 to essentially running physics

3:25:13.400 --> 3:25:16.040
 on different underlying, you know,

3:25:16.040 --> 3:25:18.140
 thinking about the physics as running in different

3:25:18.140 --> 3:25:19.540
 with different underlying rules

3:25:19.540 --> 3:25:22.980
 as if different underlying computers were running them.

3:25:22.980 --> 3:25:26.060
 And, but because of computation universality

3:25:26.060 --> 3:25:27.720
 or more accurately, because of this principle

3:25:27.720 --> 3:25:30.360
 of computational equivalence thing of mine,

3:25:30.360 --> 3:25:32.040
 there's that they are,

3:25:33.520 --> 3:25:35.760
 these things are ultimately equivalent.

3:25:35.760 --> 3:25:38.120
 So the only thing that is the ultimate fact

3:25:38.120 --> 3:25:40.920
 about the universe, the ultimate fact that doesn't depend

3:25:40.920 --> 3:25:42.760
 on any of these, you know, we don't have to talk

3:25:42.760 --> 3:25:44.640
 about specific rules, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

3:25:44.640 --> 3:25:48.360
 The ultimate fact is the universe is computational

3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:52.640
 and it is the things that happen in the universe

3:25:52.640 --> 3:25:54.920
 are the kinds of computations that the principle

3:25:54.920 --> 3:25:57.560
 of computational equivalence says should happen.

3:25:57.560 --> 3:26:00.440
 Now that might sound like you're not really saying

3:26:00.440 --> 3:26:03.920
 anything there, but you are because you can,

3:26:03.920 --> 3:26:06.640
 you could in principle have a hyper computer

3:26:06.640 --> 3:26:09.720
 that things that take an ordinary computer

3:26:09.720 --> 3:26:12.000
 an infinite time to do the hyper computer can just say,

3:26:12.000 --> 3:26:13.480
 oh, I know the answer.

3:26:13.480 --> 3:26:15.720
 It's this immediately.

3:26:15.720 --> 3:26:19.600
 What this is saying is the universe is not a hyper computer.

3:26:19.600 --> 3:26:21.800
 It's not simpler than a,

3:26:21.800 --> 3:26:24.040
 an ordinary Turing machine type computer.

3:26:24.040 --> 3:26:28.080
 It's exactly like an ordinary Turing machine type computer.

3:26:28.080 --> 3:26:30.040
 And so that's the, that's in the end,

3:26:30.040 --> 3:26:34.000
 the sort of net net conclusion is that's the thing

3:26:34.000 --> 3:26:36.600
 that is the sort of the hard immovable fact

3:26:36.600 --> 3:26:38.000
 about the universe.

3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:41.600
 That's sort of the fundamental principle of the universe

3:26:41.600 --> 3:26:45.440
 is that it is computational and not hyper computational

3:26:45.440 --> 3:26:47.280
 and not sort of infra computational.

3:26:47.280 --> 3:26:50.360
 It is this level of computational ability

3:26:50.360 --> 3:26:53.080
 and it's, it kind of has,

3:26:53.080 --> 3:26:57.080
 and that's sort of the, the, the core fact, but now,

3:26:57.080 --> 3:26:59.800
 you know, this, this idea that you can have these different

3:26:59.800 --> 3:27:02.280
 kind of a rule reference frames,

3:27:02.280 --> 3:27:05.280
 these different description languages for the universe.

3:27:05.280 --> 3:27:08.840
 It makes me, you know, I used to think, okay, you know,

3:27:08.840 --> 3:27:09.840
 imagine the aliens,

3:27:09.840 --> 3:27:12.560
 imagine the extraterrestrial intelligence thing, you know,

3:27:12.560 --> 3:27:15.560
 at least they experienced the same physics.

3:27:15.560 --> 3:27:17.440
 And now I've realized it isn't true.

3:27:17.440 --> 3:27:19.240
 They could have a different rule frame.

3:27:19.240 --> 3:27:20.480
 That's fascinating.

3:27:20.480 --> 3:27:23.920
 That they can end up with a, a, a,

3:27:23.920 --> 3:27:26.040
 a description of the universe that is utterly,

3:27:26.040 --> 3:27:28.040
 utterly incoherent with ours.

3:27:28.040 --> 3:27:31.320
 And that's also interesting in terms of how we think about,

3:27:31.320 --> 3:27:33.600
 well, intelligence, the nature of intelligence and so on.

3:27:33.600 --> 3:27:35.440
 You know, I'm, I'm fond of the quote, you know,

3:27:35.440 --> 3:27:38.640
 the weather has a mind of its own because these are,

3:27:38.640 --> 3:27:41.040
 you know, these are sort of computationally that,

3:27:41.040 --> 3:27:44.760
 that system is computationally equivalent to the system

3:27:44.760 --> 3:27:46.560
 that is our brains and so on.

3:27:46.560 --> 3:27:49.960
 And what's different is we don't have a way to understand,

3:27:49.960 --> 3:27:52.520
 you know, what the weather is trying to do, so to speak.

3:27:52.520 --> 3:27:54.880
 We have a story about what's happening in our brains.

3:27:54.880 --> 3:27:56.680
 We don't have a sort of connection

3:27:56.680 --> 3:27:57.800
 to what's happening there.

3:27:57.800 --> 3:27:59.680
 So we actually, it's funny,

3:27:59.680 --> 3:28:04.160
 last time we talked maybe over a year ago,

3:28:04.160 --> 3:28:08.080
 we talked about how it was more based on your work

3:28:08.080 --> 3:28:09.920
 with Arrival.

3:28:09.920 --> 3:28:11.600
 We talked about how would we communicate

3:28:11.600 --> 3:28:13.200
 with alien intelligences.

3:28:14.160 --> 3:28:18.000
 Can you maybe comment on how we might,

3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:20.720
 how the Wolfram Physics Project changed your view,

3:28:20.720 --> 3:28:22.200
 how we might be able to communicate

3:28:22.200 --> 3:28:23.280
 with alien intelligence?

3:28:23.280 --> 3:28:25.040
 Like if they showed up,

3:28:25.040 --> 3:28:30.040
 is it possible that because of our comprehension

3:28:30.080 --> 3:28:33.640
 of the physics of the world might be completely different,

3:28:33.640 --> 3:28:36.600
 we would just not be able to communicate at all?

3:28:36.600 --> 3:28:41.520
 Here's the thing, you know, intelligence is everywhere.

3:28:41.520 --> 3:28:43.800
 The fact this idea that there's this notion of,

3:28:43.800 --> 3:28:45.080
 oh, there's gonna be this amazing

3:28:45.080 --> 3:28:46.400
 extraterrestrial intelligence

3:28:46.400 --> 3:28:48.760
 and it's gonna be this unique thing.

3:28:48.760 --> 3:28:50.080
 It's just not true.

3:28:50.080 --> 3:28:51.360
 It's the same thing.

3:28:51.360 --> 3:28:53.240
 You know, I think people will realize this

3:28:53.240 --> 3:28:54.840
 about the time when people decide

3:28:54.840 --> 3:28:57.280
 that artificial intelligences are kind of

3:28:57.280 --> 3:29:01.160
 just natural things that are like human intelligences.

3:29:01.160 --> 3:29:04.520
 They'll realize that extraterrestrial intelligences

3:29:04.520 --> 3:29:07.720
 or intelligences associated with physical systems

3:29:07.720 --> 3:29:09.760
 and so on, it's all the same kind of thing.

3:29:09.760 --> 3:29:11.160
 It's ultimately computation.

3:29:11.160 --> 3:29:12.080
 It's all the same.

3:29:12.080 --> 3:29:13.280
 It's all just computation.

3:29:13.280 --> 3:29:17.160
 And the issue is, can you, are you sort of inside it?

3:29:17.160 --> 3:29:19.200
 Are you thinking about it?

3:29:19.200 --> 3:29:22.200
 Do you have sort of a story you're telling yourself

3:29:22.200 --> 3:29:23.160
 about it?

3:29:23.160 --> 3:29:25.200
 And you know, the weather could have a story

3:29:25.200 --> 3:29:27.560
 it's telling itself about what it's doing.

3:29:27.560 --> 3:29:30.920
 We just, it's utterly incoherent with the stories

3:29:30.920 --> 3:29:33.560
 that we tell ourselves based on how our brains work.

3:29:33.560 --> 3:29:37.080
 I mean, ultimately it must be a question

3:29:37.080 --> 3:29:39.280
 whether we can align.

3:29:39.280 --> 3:29:40.120
 Exactly.

3:29:40.120 --> 3:29:41.960
 Align with the kind of intelligence.

3:29:41.960 --> 3:29:42.800
 Right, right, right.

3:29:42.800 --> 3:29:44.200
 So there's a systematic way of doing it.

3:29:44.200 --> 3:29:45.520
 Right, so the question is in the space

3:29:45.520 --> 3:29:47.240
 of all possible intelligences,

3:29:47.240 --> 3:29:50.440
 what's the, how do you think about the distance

3:29:50.440 --> 3:29:52.400
 between description languages

3:29:52.400 --> 3:29:54.680
 for one intelligence versus another?

3:29:54.680 --> 3:29:57.120
 And needless to say, I have thought about this

3:29:57.120 --> 3:30:00.880
 and you know, I don't have a great answer yet,

3:30:00.880 --> 3:30:02.920
 but I think that's a thing

3:30:02.920 --> 3:30:04.440
 where there will be things that can be said

3:30:04.440 --> 3:30:06.000
 and there'll be things that where you can sort of

3:30:06.000 --> 3:30:08.400
 start to characterize, you know,

3:30:08.400 --> 3:30:12.880
 what is the translation distance between this,

3:30:12.880 --> 3:30:15.120
 you know, version of the universe

3:30:15.120 --> 3:30:17.840
 or this kind of set of computational rules

3:30:17.840 --> 3:30:18.800
 and this other one.

3:30:18.800 --> 3:30:21.480
 In fact, okay, so this is a, you know,

3:30:21.480 --> 3:30:23.560
 there's this idea of algorithmic information theory.

3:30:23.560 --> 3:30:25.800
 There's this question of sort of what is the,

3:30:25.800 --> 3:30:28.680
 when you have something,

3:30:28.680 --> 3:30:31.520
 what is the sort of shortest description you can make of it

3:30:31.520 --> 3:30:33.320
 where that description could be saying,

3:30:33.320 --> 3:30:36.480
 run this program to get the thing, right?

3:30:36.480 --> 3:30:41.480
 So I'm pretty sure that there will be a physicalization

3:30:45.280 --> 3:30:47.720
 of the idea of algorithmic information

3:30:47.720 --> 3:30:51.560
 and that, okay, this is again, a little bit bizarre,

3:30:51.560 --> 3:30:54.480
 but so I mentioned that there's the speed of light,

3:30:54.480 --> 3:30:57.560
 maximum speed of information transmission in physical space.

3:30:57.560 --> 3:30:59.840
 There's a maximum speed of information transmission

3:30:59.840 --> 3:31:02.920
 in branchial space, which is a maximum entanglement speed.

3:31:02.920 --> 3:31:05.240
 There's a maximum speed of information transmission

3:31:05.240 --> 3:31:07.160
 in ruleal space, which is,

3:31:07.160 --> 3:31:10.600
 has to do with a maximum speed of translation

3:31:10.600 --> 3:31:14.480
 between different description languages.

3:31:14.480 --> 3:31:17.440
 And again, I'm not fully wrapped my brain around this one.

3:31:17.440 --> 3:31:20.080
 Yeah, that one just blows my mind to think about that,

3:31:20.080 --> 3:31:22.800
 but that starts getting closer to the, yeah,

3:31:22.800 --> 3:31:25.280
 the intelligence. It's kind of a physicalization.

3:31:25.280 --> 3:31:27.840
 Right, and it's also a physicalization

3:31:27.840 --> 3:31:29.920
 of algorithmic information.

3:31:29.920 --> 3:31:32.320
 And I think there's probably a connection between,

3:31:32.320 --> 3:31:33.600
 I mean, there's probably a connection

3:31:33.600 --> 3:31:36.600
 between the notion of energy and some of these things,

3:31:36.600 --> 3:31:39.400
 which again, I hadn't seen all this coming.

3:31:39.400 --> 3:31:41.120
 I've always been a little bit resistant

3:31:41.120 --> 3:31:43.480
 to the idea of connecting physical energy

3:31:43.480 --> 3:31:45.640
 to things in computation theory,

3:31:45.640 --> 3:31:47.200
 but I think that's probably coming.

3:31:47.200 --> 3:31:48.560
 And that's what essentially at the core

3:31:48.560 --> 3:31:50.680
 with the physics project is

3:31:50.680 --> 3:31:55.560
 that you're connecting information theory with physics.

3:31:55.560 --> 3:31:56.880
 Yeah, it's computation.

3:31:56.880 --> 3:31:59.560
 Computation with our physical universe.

3:31:59.560 --> 3:32:00.400
 Yeah, right.

3:32:00.400 --> 3:32:03.480
 I mean, the fact that our physical universe is,

3:32:03.480 --> 3:32:05.720
 right, that we can think of it as a computation

3:32:05.720 --> 3:32:08.760
 and that we can have discussions like,

3:32:08.760 --> 3:32:11.000
 the theory of the physical universe

3:32:11.000 --> 3:32:14.520
 is the same kind of a theory as the P versus MP problem

3:32:14.520 --> 3:32:18.640
 and so on is really, I think that's really interesting.

3:32:18.640 --> 3:32:21.520
 And the fact that, well, okay,

3:32:21.520 --> 3:32:24.240
 so this kind of brings me to one more thing

3:32:24.240 --> 3:32:26.120
 that I have to in terms of this sort of unification

3:32:26.120 --> 3:32:29.640
 of different ideas, which is metamathematics.

3:32:29.640 --> 3:32:30.520
 Yeah, let's talk about that.

3:32:30.520 --> 3:32:31.680
 You mentioned that earlier.

3:32:31.680 --> 3:32:34.760
 What the heck is metamathematics and...

3:32:34.760 --> 3:32:36.880
 Okay, so here's what, okay.

3:32:36.880 --> 3:32:38.840
 So what is mathematics?

3:32:38.840 --> 3:32:43.840
 Mathematics, sort of at a lowest level,

3:32:43.840 --> 3:32:47.400
 one thinks of mathematics as you have certain axioms.

3:32:47.400 --> 3:32:51.840
 You say things like X plus Y is the same as Y plus X.

3:32:51.840 --> 3:32:55.360
 That's an axiom about addition.

3:32:55.360 --> 3:32:57.360
 And then you say, we've got these axioms

3:32:57.360 --> 3:33:00.560
 and from these axioms, we derive all these theorems

3:33:00.560 --> 3:33:02.880
 that fill up the literature of mathematics.

3:33:02.880 --> 3:33:04.760
 The activity of mathematicians

3:33:04.760 --> 3:33:06.800
 is to derive all these theorems.

3:33:06.800 --> 3:33:10.360
 Actually, the axioms of mathematics are very small.

3:33:10.360 --> 3:33:13.520
 You can fit, when I did my new kind of science book,

3:33:13.520 --> 3:33:16.000
 I fit all of the standard axioms of mathematics

3:33:16.000 --> 3:33:17.560
 on basically a page and a half.

3:33:18.760 --> 3:33:19.640
 Not much stuff.

3:33:19.640 --> 3:33:21.400
 It's like a very simple rule

3:33:21.400 --> 3:33:24.000
 from which all of mathematics arises.

3:33:24.000 --> 3:33:26.640
 The way it works though is a little different

3:33:26.640 --> 3:33:31.640
 from the way things work in sort of a computation

3:33:31.720 --> 3:33:33.440
 because in mathematics, what you're interested in

3:33:33.440 --> 3:33:36.160
 is a proof and the proof says,

3:33:36.160 --> 3:33:40.360
 from here, you can use, from this expression, for example,

3:33:40.360 --> 3:33:43.040
 you can use these axioms to get to this other expression.

3:33:43.040 --> 3:33:45.440
 So that proves these two things are equal.

3:33:45.440 --> 3:33:49.040
 Okay, so we can begin to see how this has been going to work.

3:33:49.040 --> 3:33:51.360
 What's gonna happen is there are paths

3:33:51.360 --> 3:33:53.400
 in metamathematical space.

3:33:53.400 --> 3:33:57.640
 So what happens is each, two different ways to look at it.

3:33:57.640 --> 3:33:59.880
 You can just look at it as mathematical expressions

3:33:59.880 --> 3:34:02.640
 or you can look at it as mathematical statements,

3:34:02.640 --> 3:34:04.120
 postulates or something.

3:34:04.120 --> 3:34:06.440
 But either way, you think of these things

3:34:06.440 --> 3:34:11.440
 and they are connected by these axioms.

3:34:11.480 --> 3:34:13.680
 So in other words, you have some fact

3:34:14.760 --> 3:34:16.960
 or you have some expression, you apply this axiom,

3:34:16.960 --> 3:34:18.840
 you get some other expression.

3:34:18.840 --> 3:34:21.600
 And in general, given some expression,

3:34:21.600 --> 3:34:23.880
 there may be many possible different expressions

3:34:23.880 --> 3:34:24.840
 you can get.

3:34:24.840 --> 3:34:27.320
 You basically build up a multiway graph

3:34:27.320 --> 3:34:31.120
 and a proof is a path through the multiway graph

3:34:31.120 --> 3:34:34.200
 that goes from one thing to another thing.

3:34:34.200 --> 3:34:36.920
 The path tells you how did you get from one thing

3:34:36.920 --> 3:34:37.760
 to the other thing.

3:34:37.760 --> 3:34:40.680
 It's the story of how you got from this to that.

3:34:40.680 --> 3:34:42.840
 The theorem is the thing at one end

3:34:42.840 --> 3:34:44.640
 is equal to the thing at the other end.

3:34:44.640 --> 3:34:46.880
 The proof is the path you go down

3:34:46.880 --> 3:34:48.600
 to get from one thing to the other.

3:34:48.600 --> 3:34:52.600
 You mentioned that Gödel's incompleteness theorem

3:34:52.600 --> 3:34:53.560
 fits naturally there.

3:34:53.560 --> 3:34:54.400
 How does it fit?

3:34:54.400 --> 3:34:57.160
 Yeah, so what happens there is that the Gödel's theorem

3:34:57.160 --> 3:35:01.240
 is basically saying that there are paths of infinite length.

3:35:01.240 --> 3:35:03.120
 That is that there's no upper bound.

3:35:03.120 --> 3:35:04.240
 If you know these two things,

3:35:04.240 --> 3:35:06.200
 you say, I'm trying to get from here to here,

3:35:06.200 --> 3:35:07.920
 how long do I have to go?

3:35:07.920 --> 3:35:10.800
 You say, well, I've looked at all the paths of length 10.

3:35:10.800 --> 3:35:12.600
 Somebody says, that's not good enough.

3:35:12.600 --> 3:35:14.720
 That path might be of length a billion.

3:35:14.720 --> 3:35:17.400
 And there's no upper bound on how long that path is.

3:35:17.400 --> 3:35:19.760
 And that's what leads to the incompleteness theorem.

3:35:19.760 --> 3:35:24.480
 So I mean, the thing that is kind of an emerging idea

3:35:24.480 --> 3:35:26.160
 is you can start asking,

3:35:26.160 --> 3:35:27.840
 what's the analog of Einstein's equations

3:35:27.840 --> 3:35:29.720
 in metamathematical space?

3:35:29.720 --> 3:35:31.160
 What's the analog of a black hole

3:35:31.160 --> 3:35:33.120
 in metamathematical space?

3:35:33.120 --> 3:35:33.960
 What's the hope of this?

3:35:33.960 --> 3:35:36.840
 So yeah, it's fascinating to model all the mathematics

3:35:36.840 --> 3:35:37.680
 in this way.

3:35:37.680 --> 3:35:38.520
 So here's what it is.

3:35:38.520 --> 3:35:40.320
 This is mathematics in bulk.

3:35:40.320 --> 3:35:44.000
 So human mathematicians have made a few million theorems.

3:35:44.000 --> 3:35:45.800
 They've published a few million theorems.

3:35:45.800 --> 3:35:48.400
 But imagine the infinite future of mathematics.

3:35:48.400 --> 3:35:50.440
 Apply something to mathematics

3:35:50.440 --> 3:35:52.360
 that mathematics likes to apply to other things.

3:35:52.360 --> 3:35:53.520
 Take a limit.

3:35:53.520 --> 3:35:56.320
 What is the limit of the infinite future of mathematics?

3:35:56.320 --> 3:35:57.560
 What does it look like?

3:35:57.560 --> 3:35:59.560
 What is the continuum limit of mathematics?

3:35:59.560 --> 3:36:01.560
 What is the, as you just fill in

3:36:01.560 --> 3:36:03.120
 more and more and more theorems,

3:36:03.120 --> 3:36:04.040
 what does it look like?

3:36:04.040 --> 3:36:05.040
 What does it do?

3:36:05.040 --> 3:36:07.360
 How does, what kinds of conclusions can you make?

3:36:07.360 --> 3:36:09.800
 So for example, one thing I've just been doing

3:36:09.800 --> 3:36:10.960
 is taking Euclid.

3:36:10.960 --> 3:36:12.760
 So Euclid, very impressive.

3:36:12.760 --> 3:36:17.400
 He had 10 axioms, he derived 465 theorems, okay?

3:36:17.400 --> 3:36:19.120
 His book, you know,

3:36:19.120 --> 3:36:21.960
 that was the sort of defining book of mathematics

3:36:21.960 --> 3:36:23.120
 for 2000 years.

3:36:24.120 --> 3:36:25.640
 So you can actually map out,

3:36:25.640 --> 3:36:28.800
 and I actually did this 20 years ago,

3:36:28.800 --> 3:36:30.720
 but I've done it more seriously now.

3:36:30.720 --> 3:36:32.640
 You can map out the theorem dependency

3:36:32.640 --> 3:36:34.760
 of those 465 theorems.

3:36:34.760 --> 3:36:37.520
 So from the axioms, you grow this graph,

3:36:37.520 --> 3:36:39.200
 it's actually a multiway graph,

3:36:39.200 --> 3:36:42.400
 of how all these theorems get proved from other theorems.

3:36:42.400 --> 3:36:45.240
 And so you can ask questions about, you know,

3:36:45.240 --> 3:36:46.080
 well, you can ask things like,

3:36:46.080 --> 3:36:47.520
 what's the hardest theorem in Euclid?

3:36:47.520 --> 3:36:48.840
 The answer is, the hardest theorem

3:36:48.840 --> 3:36:50.960
 is that there are five platonic solids.

3:36:50.960 --> 3:36:52.800
 That turns out to be the hardest theorem in Euclid.

3:36:52.800 --> 3:36:55.320
 That's actually his last theorem in all his books.

3:36:55.320 --> 3:36:56.160
 That's the final.

3:36:56.160 --> 3:36:58.440
 What's the hardness, the distance you have to travel?

3:36:58.440 --> 3:37:01.080
 Yeah, let's say it's 33 steps from the,

3:37:01.080 --> 3:37:03.720
 the longest path in the graph is 33 steps.

3:37:03.720 --> 3:37:07.400
 So that's the, there's a 33 step path you have to follow

3:37:07.400 --> 3:37:10.920
 to go from the axioms, according to Euclid's proofs,

3:37:10.920 --> 3:37:13.560
 to the statement there are five platonic solids.

3:37:13.560 --> 3:37:17.480
 So, okay, so then the question is,

3:37:17.480 --> 3:37:22.360
 in, what does it mean if you have this map?

3:37:22.360 --> 3:37:26.400
 Okay, so in a sense, this metamathematical space

3:37:26.400 --> 3:37:29.200
 is the infrastructural space of all possible theorems

3:37:29.200 --> 3:37:31.560
 that you could prove in mathematics.

3:37:31.560 --> 3:37:34.360
 That's the geometry of metamathematics.

3:37:34.360 --> 3:37:37.120
 There's also the geography of mathematics.

3:37:37.120 --> 3:37:40.760
 That is, where did people choose to live in space?

3:37:40.760 --> 3:37:42.240
 And that's what, for example,

3:37:42.240 --> 3:37:44.320
 exploring the sort of empirical metamathematics

3:37:44.320 --> 3:37:45.160
 that Euclid is doing.

3:37:45.160 --> 3:37:48.360
 You could put each individual, like, human mathematician,

3:37:48.360 --> 3:37:49.840
 you can embed them into that space.

3:37:49.840 --> 3:37:51.000
 I mean, they kind of live.

3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:52.320
 They represent a path in the space.

3:37:52.320 --> 3:37:53.160
 The little path.

3:37:53.160 --> 3:37:54.000
 The things they do.

3:37:54.000 --> 3:37:54.820
 Maybe a set of paths.

3:37:54.820 --> 3:37:55.660
 Right.

3:37:55.660 --> 3:37:58.480
 So like a set of axioms that are chosen.

3:37:58.480 --> 3:37:59.400
 Right, so for example,

3:37:59.400 --> 3:38:01.960
 here's an example of a thing that I realized.

3:38:01.960 --> 3:38:03.920
 So one of the surprising things about,

3:38:03.920 --> 3:38:06.040
 well, there are two surprising facts about math.

3:38:06.040 --> 3:38:07.520
 One is that it's hard,

3:38:07.520 --> 3:38:10.200
 and the other is that it's doable, okay?

3:38:10.200 --> 3:38:12.640
 So first question is, why is math hard?

3:38:12.640 --> 3:38:13.800
 You know, you've got these axioms.

3:38:13.800 --> 3:38:14.980
 They're very small.

3:38:14.980 --> 3:38:17.640
 Why can't you just solve every problem in math easily?

3:38:17.640 --> 3:38:19.120
 Yeah, it's just logic.

3:38:19.120 --> 3:38:19.960
 Right, yeah.

3:38:19.960 --> 3:38:22.560
 Well, logic happens to be a particular special case

3:38:22.560 --> 3:38:25.280
 that does have certain simplicity to it.

3:38:25.280 --> 3:38:27.580
 But general mathematics, even arithmetic,

3:38:27.580 --> 3:38:30.360
 already doesn't have the simplicity that logic has.

3:38:30.360 --> 3:38:31.720
 So why is it hard?

3:38:31.720 --> 3:38:33.840
 Because of computational irreducibility.

3:38:33.840 --> 3:38:34.680
 Right.

3:38:35.560 --> 3:38:38.900
 Because what happens is, to know what's true,

3:38:38.900 --> 3:38:40.720
 and this is this whole story about the path

3:38:40.720 --> 3:38:43.000
 you have to follow and how long is the path,

3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:44.520
 and Gödel's theorem is the statement

3:38:44.520 --> 3:38:47.680
 that the path is not a bounded length,

3:38:47.680 --> 3:38:50.440
 but the fact that the path is not always compressible

3:38:50.440 --> 3:38:54.480
 to something tiny is a story of computational irreducibility.

3:38:54.480 --> 3:38:56.800
 So that's why math is hard.

3:38:56.800 --> 3:38:59.520
 Now, the next question is, why is math doable?

3:38:59.520 --> 3:39:02.260
 Because it might be the case that most things you care about

3:39:02.260 --> 3:39:04.200
 don't have finite length paths.

3:39:04.200 --> 3:39:06.720
 Most things you care about might be things

3:39:06.720 --> 3:39:10.160
 where you get lost in the sea of computational irreducibility

3:39:10.160 --> 3:39:12.520
 and worse, undecidability.

3:39:12.520 --> 3:39:14.760
 That is, there's just no finite length path

3:39:14.760 --> 3:39:15.820
 that gets you there.

3:39:17.000 --> 3:39:19.040
 Why is mathematics doable?

3:39:19.040 --> 3:39:22.200
 Gödel proved his incompleteness theorem in 1931.

3:39:22.200 --> 3:39:25.240
 Most working mathematicians don't really care about it.

3:39:25.240 --> 3:39:27.240
 They just go ahead and do mathematics,

3:39:27.240 --> 3:39:29.720
 even though it could be that the questions they're asking

3:39:29.720 --> 3:39:31.040
 are undecidable.

3:39:31.040 --> 3:39:32.880
 It could have been that Fermat's last theorem

3:39:32.880 --> 3:39:33.720
 is undecidable.

3:39:33.720 --> 3:39:35.120
 It turned out it had a proof.

3:39:35.120 --> 3:39:36.960
 It's a long, complicated proof.

3:39:36.960 --> 3:39:40.200
 The twin prime conjecture might be undecidable.

3:39:40.200 --> 3:39:43.020
 The Riemann hypothesis might be undecidable.

3:39:43.020 --> 3:39:45.920
 These things might be, the axioms of mathematics

3:39:45.920 --> 3:39:49.020
 might not be strong enough to reach those statements.

3:39:49.020 --> 3:39:51.400
 It might be the case that depending on what axioms

3:39:51.400 --> 3:39:53.440
 you choose, you can either say that's true

3:39:53.440 --> 3:39:54.760
 or that's not true.

3:39:54.760 --> 3:39:55.600
 So...

3:39:55.600 --> 3:39:57.640
 And by the way, from Fermat's last theorem,

3:39:57.640 --> 3:39:59.420
 there could be a shorter path.

3:39:59.420 --> 3:40:00.360
 Absolutely.

3:40:00.360 --> 3:40:03.720
 Yeah, so the notion of geodesics in metamathematical space

3:40:03.720 --> 3:40:07.260
 is the notion of shortest proofs in metamathematical space.

3:40:07.260 --> 3:40:09.400
 And that's a, you know, human mathematicians

3:40:09.400 --> 3:40:11.400
 do not find shortest paths,

3:40:11.400 --> 3:40:13.940
 nor do automated theorem provers.

3:40:13.940 --> 3:40:16.840
 But the fact, and by the way, the, I mean,

3:40:16.840 --> 3:40:18.760
 this stuff is so bizarrely connected.

3:40:18.760 --> 3:40:21.640
 I mean, if you're into automated theorem proving,

3:40:21.640 --> 3:40:23.500
 there are these so called critical pair lemmas

3:40:23.500 --> 3:40:24.900
 and automated theorem proving.

3:40:24.900 --> 3:40:28.600
 Those are precisely the branch pairs in our,

3:40:28.600 --> 3:40:30.600
 that in multiway graphs.

3:40:30.600 --> 3:40:32.920
 Let me just finish on the why mathematics is doable.

3:40:32.920 --> 3:40:34.120
 Oh yes, the second part.

3:40:34.120 --> 3:40:36.680
 So you know why it's hard, why is it doable?

3:40:36.680 --> 3:40:38.120
 Right, why do we not just get lost

3:40:38.120 --> 3:40:39.520
 in undecidability all the time?

3:40:39.520 --> 3:40:40.560
 Yeah.

3:40:40.560 --> 3:40:43.160
 So, and here's another fact,

3:40:43.160 --> 3:40:45.400
 is in doing computer experiments

3:40:45.400 --> 3:40:47.020
 and doing experimental mathematics,

3:40:47.020 --> 3:40:49.020
 you do get lost in that way.

3:40:49.020 --> 3:40:53.860
 When you just say, I'm picking a random integer equation.

3:40:53.860 --> 3:40:56.200
 How do I, does it have a solution or not?

3:40:56.200 --> 3:40:57.400
 And you just pick it at random

3:40:57.400 --> 3:41:00.900
 without any human sort of path getting there.

3:41:00.900 --> 3:41:03.280
 Often, it's really, really hard.

3:41:03.280 --> 3:41:04.760
 It's really hard to answer those questions.

3:41:04.760 --> 3:41:07.840
 We just pick them at random from the space of possibilities.

3:41:07.840 --> 3:41:10.720
 But what I think is happening is,

3:41:10.720 --> 3:41:12.460
 and that's a case where you just fell off

3:41:12.460 --> 3:41:15.560
 into this ocean of sort of irreducibility and so on.

3:41:15.560 --> 3:41:18.220
 What's happening is human mathematics

3:41:18.220 --> 3:41:19.920
 is a story of building a path.

3:41:19.920 --> 3:41:23.220
 You started off, you're always building out

3:41:23.220 --> 3:41:25.720
 on this path where you are proving things.

3:41:25.720 --> 3:41:28.120
 You've got this proof trajectory

3:41:28.120 --> 3:41:30.320
 and you're basically, the human mathematics

3:41:30.320 --> 3:41:34.160
 is the sort of the exploration of the world

3:41:34.160 --> 3:41:36.760
 along this proof trajectory, so to speak.

3:41:36.760 --> 3:41:41.760
 You're not just parachuting in from anywhere.

3:41:42.840 --> 3:41:44.840
 You're following Lewis and Clark or whatever.

3:41:44.840 --> 3:41:48.160
 You're actually going, doing the path.

3:41:48.160 --> 3:41:52.080
 And the fact that you are constrained to go along that path

3:41:52.080 --> 3:41:53.760
 is the reason you don't end up with,

3:41:53.760 --> 3:41:55.840
 every so often you'll see a little piece of undecidability

3:41:55.840 --> 3:41:57.980
 and you'll avoid that part of the path.

3:41:57.980 --> 3:42:00.960
 But that's basically the story of why human mathematics

3:42:00.960 --> 3:42:02.640
 has seemed to be doable.

3:42:02.640 --> 3:42:05.200
 It's a story of exploring these paths

3:42:05.200 --> 3:42:07.240
 that are by their nature,

3:42:07.240 --> 3:42:10.480
 they have been constructed to be paths that can be followed.

3:42:10.480 --> 3:42:12.260
 And so you can follow them further.

3:42:12.260 --> 3:42:14.920
 Now, why is this relevant to anything?

3:42:14.920 --> 3:42:19.480
 So, okay, so here's my belief.

3:42:19.480 --> 3:42:22.640
 The fact that human mathematics works that way

3:42:22.640 --> 3:42:26.080
 is I think there's some sort of connections

3:42:26.080 --> 3:42:29.720
 between the way that observers work in physics

3:42:29.720 --> 3:42:32.980
 and the way that the axiom systems of mathematics are set up

3:42:32.980 --> 3:42:36.360
 to make mathematics be doable in that kind of way.

3:42:36.360 --> 3:42:38.880
 And so, in other words, in particular,

3:42:38.880 --> 3:42:41.720
 I think there is an analog of causal invariance,

3:42:41.720 --> 3:42:44.800
 which I think is, and this is again,

3:42:44.800 --> 3:42:46.620
 it's sort of the upper reaches of mathematics

3:42:46.620 --> 3:42:50.680
 and stuff that it's a thing,

3:42:50.680 --> 3:42:52.900
 there's this thing called homotopy type theory,

3:42:52.900 --> 3:42:56.120
 which is an abstract, it's came out of category theory,

3:42:56.120 --> 3:42:58.380
 and it's sort of an abstraction of mathematics.

3:42:58.380 --> 3:43:00.360
 Mathematics itself is an abstraction,

3:43:00.360 --> 3:43:03.980
 but it's an abstraction of the abstraction of mathematics.

3:43:03.980 --> 3:43:06.620
 And there is the thing called the univalence axiom,

3:43:06.620 --> 3:43:11.620
 which is a sort of a key axiom in that set of ideas.

3:43:12.220 --> 3:43:14.200
 And I'm pretty sure the univalence axiom

3:43:14.200 --> 3:43:16.220
 is equivalent to causal invariance.

3:43:16.220 --> 3:43:18.120
 What was the term you used again?

3:43:18.120 --> 3:43:19.000
 Univalence.

3:43:19.000 --> 3:43:21.560
 Is that something for somebody like me accessible?

3:43:21.560 --> 3:43:23.200
 Or is this?

3:43:23.200 --> 3:43:25.560
 There's a statement of it that's fairly accessible.

3:43:25.560 --> 3:43:27.080
 I mean, the statement of it is,

3:43:29.680 --> 3:43:32.760
 basically it says things which are equivalent

3:43:32.760 --> 3:43:34.620
 can be considered to be identical.

3:43:35.520 --> 3:43:38.160
 In which space?

3:43:38.160 --> 3:43:40.720
 Yeah, it's in higher category.

3:43:40.720 --> 3:43:41.720
 In category.

3:43:41.720 --> 3:43:43.880
 Okay, so it's a, but I mean,

3:43:43.880 --> 3:43:46.160
 the thing just to give a sketch of how that works.

3:43:46.160 --> 3:43:49.680
 So category theory is an attempt to idealize,

3:43:49.680 --> 3:43:52.060
 it's an attempt to sort of have a formal theory

3:43:52.060 --> 3:43:54.400
 of mathematics that is at a sort of higher level

3:43:54.400 --> 3:43:55.600
 than mathematics.

3:43:55.600 --> 3:43:59.560
 It's where you just think about these mathematical objects

3:43:59.560 --> 3:44:03.720
 and these categories of objects and these morphisms,

3:44:03.720 --> 3:44:05.600
 these connections between categories.

3:44:05.600 --> 3:44:08.640
 Okay, so it turns out the morphisms and categories,

3:44:08.640 --> 3:44:10.840
 at least weak categories,

3:44:10.840 --> 3:44:14.820
 are very much like the paths in our hypergraphs and things.

3:44:14.820 --> 3:44:18.480
 And it turns out, again, this is where it all gets crazy.

3:44:18.480 --> 3:44:20.800
 I mean, the fact that these things are connected

3:44:20.800 --> 3:44:22.000
 is just bizarre.

3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:27.000
 So category theory, our causal graphs

3:44:27.080 --> 3:44:29.940
 are like second order category theory.

3:44:29.940 --> 3:44:32.640
 And it turns out you can take the limits

3:44:32.640 --> 3:44:34.160
 of infinite order category theory.

3:44:34.160 --> 3:44:36.480
 So just give roughly the idea.

3:44:36.480 --> 3:44:39.120
 This is a roughly explainable idea.

3:44:39.120 --> 3:44:43.400
 So a mathematical proof will be a path

3:44:43.400 --> 3:44:45.920
 that says you can get from this thing to this other thing.

3:44:45.920 --> 3:44:47.480
 And here's the path that you get from this thing

3:44:47.480 --> 3:44:48.720
 to this other thing.

3:44:48.720 --> 3:44:51.160
 But in general, there may be many paths,

3:44:51.160 --> 3:44:53.960
 many proofs that get you many different paths

3:44:53.960 --> 3:44:55.800
 that all successfully go from this thing

3:44:55.800 --> 3:44:57.700
 to this other thing, okay?

3:44:57.700 --> 3:45:00.400
 Now you can define a higher order proof,

3:45:00.400 --> 3:45:03.840
 which is a proof of the equivalence of those proofs.

3:45:03.840 --> 3:45:05.440
 Okay, so you're saying there's a...

3:45:05.440 --> 3:45:07.120
 A path between those proofs essentially.

3:45:07.120 --> 3:45:09.800
 Yes, a path between the paths, okay?

3:45:09.800 --> 3:45:10.960
 And so you do that.

3:45:10.960 --> 3:45:12.300
 That's the sort of second order thing.

3:45:12.300 --> 3:45:16.120
 That path between the paths is essentially related

3:45:16.120 --> 3:45:18.240
 to our causal graphs.

3:45:18.240 --> 3:45:19.560
 Then you can take the limit.

3:45:19.560 --> 3:45:20.400
 Wow, okay.

3:45:20.400 --> 3:45:23.040
 The path between path, between path, between path.

3:45:23.040 --> 3:45:24.640
 The infinite limit.

3:45:24.640 --> 3:45:26.340
 That infinite limit turns out to be

3:45:26.340 --> 3:45:28.800
 our Rulial Multiway System.

3:45:28.800 --> 3:45:31.600
 Yeah, the Rulial Multiway System,

3:45:31.600 --> 3:45:33.860
 that's a fascinating, both in the physics world

3:45:33.860 --> 3:45:36.920
 and as you're saying now, that's fast.

3:45:36.920 --> 3:45:39.120
 I'm not sure I've loaded it in completely, but...

3:45:39.120 --> 3:45:40.320
 Well, I'm not sure I have either.

3:45:40.320 --> 3:45:42.560
 And it may be one of these things where,

3:45:42.560 --> 3:45:45.160
 in another five years or something, it's like,

3:45:45.160 --> 3:45:47.120
 it was obvious, but I didn't see it.

3:45:47.120 --> 3:45:49.360
 No, but the thing which is sort of interesting to me

3:45:49.360 --> 3:45:53.080
 is that there's sort of an upper reach of mathematics,

3:45:53.080 --> 3:45:54.840
 of the abstraction of mathematics.

3:45:55.880 --> 3:45:59.000
 This thing, there's this mathematician called Grothendieck

3:45:59.000 --> 3:46:00.680
 who's generally viewed as being sort of one

3:46:00.680 --> 3:46:02.320
 of the most abstract,

3:46:02.320 --> 3:46:04.800
 sort of creator of the most abstract mathematics

3:46:04.800 --> 3:46:07.900
 of 1970s ish timeframe.

3:46:09.360 --> 3:46:11.560
 And one of the things that he constructed was this thing

3:46:11.560 --> 3:46:13.280
 he called the Infinity Grupoid.

3:46:13.280 --> 3:46:15.820
 And he has this sort of hypothesis

3:46:15.820 --> 3:46:18.380
 about the inevitable appearance of geometry

3:46:18.380 --> 3:46:22.420
 from essentially logic in the structure of this thing.

3:46:22.420 --> 3:46:24.660
 Well, it turns out this Rulial Multiway System

3:46:24.660 --> 3:46:26.620
 is the Infinity Grupoid.

3:46:26.620 --> 3:46:29.700
 So it's this limiting object.

3:46:29.700 --> 3:46:33.560
 And this is an instance of that limiting object.

3:46:33.560 --> 3:46:35.460
 So what to me is, I mean, again,

3:46:35.460 --> 3:46:37.980
 I've been always afraid of this kind of mathematics

3:46:37.980 --> 3:46:42.260
 because it seemed incomprehensibly abstract to me.

3:46:42.260 --> 3:46:45.620
 But what I'm sort of excited about with this

3:46:45.620 --> 3:46:49.540
 is that we've sort of concretified the way

3:46:49.540 --> 3:46:51.860
 that you can reach this kind of mathematics,

3:46:51.860 --> 3:46:55.260
 which makes it, well, both seem more relevant

3:46:55.260 --> 3:46:58.820
 and also the fact that I don't yet know exactly

3:46:58.820 --> 3:47:01.120
 what mileage we're gonna get from using

3:47:01.120 --> 3:47:03.340
 the sort of the apparatus that's been built

3:47:03.340 --> 3:47:06.500
 in those areas of mathematics to analyze what we're doing.

3:47:06.500 --> 3:47:07.340
 But the thing that's.

3:47:07.340 --> 3:47:08.180
 So both ways.

3:47:08.180 --> 3:47:10.020
 So using mathematics to understand what you're doing

3:47:10.020 --> 3:47:12.340
 and using what you're doing computationally

3:47:12.340 --> 3:47:13.180
 to understand that.

3:47:13.180 --> 3:47:14.020
 Right, so for example,

3:47:14.020 --> 3:47:17.860
 the understanding of metamathematical space,

3:47:17.860 --> 3:47:19.860
 one of the reasons I really want to do that

3:47:19.860 --> 3:47:22.620
 is because I want to understand quantum mechanics better.

3:47:22.620 --> 3:47:25.980
 And that, what you see,

3:47:25.980 --> 3:47:30.260
 we live that kind of the multiway graph of mathematics

3:47:30.260 --> 3:47:32.540
 because we actually know this is a theorem we've heard of.

3:47:32.540 --> 3:47:34.020
 This is another one we've heard of.

3:47:34.020 --> 3:47:36.900
 We can actually say these are actual things in the world

3:47:36.900 --> 3:47:38.480
 that we relate to,

3:47:38.480 --> 3:47:43.100
 which we can't really do as readily for the physics case.

3:47:43.100 --> 3:47:45.180
 And so it's kind of a way to help my intuition.

3:47:45.180 --> 3:47:47.820
 It's also, there are bizarre things

3:47:47.820 --> 3:47:50.020
 like what's the analog of Einstein's equations

3:47:50.020 --> 3:47:51.880
 in metamathematical space?

3:47:51.880 --> 3:47:53.980
 What's the analog of a black hole?

3:47:53.980 --> 3:47:57.660
 It turns out it looks like not completely sure yet,

3:47:57.660 --> 3:48:00.180
 but there's this notion of nonconstructive proofs

3:48:00.180 --> 3:48:01.500
 in mathematics.

3:48:01.500 --> 3:48:03.540
 And I think those relate to,

3:48:03.540 --> 3:48:07.780
 well, actually they relate to things

3:48:07.780 --> 3:48:10.420
 related to event horizons.

3:48:10.420 --> 3:48:13.500
 So the fact that you can take ideas from physics

3:48:13.500 --> 3:48:14.460
 like event horizons.

3:48:14.460 --> 3:48:17.100
 And map them into the same kind of space, metamath.

3:48:17.100 --> 3:48:17.940
 It's really.

3:48:17.940 --> 3:48:19.460
 So do you think there'll be,

3:48:19.460 --> 3:48:22.140
 do you think you might stumble upon

3:48:22.140 --> 3:48:25.860
 some breakthrough ideas in theorem proving?

3:48:25.860 --> 3:48:28.700
 Like for, from the other direction?

3:48:28.700 --> 3:48:29.540
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:48:29.540 --> 3:48:32.180
 No, I mean, what's really nice is that we are using,

3:48:32.180 --> 3:48:35.640
 so this absolutely directly maps to theorem proving.

3:48:35.640 --> 3:48:37.240
 So pods and multiway graphs,

3:48:37.240 --> 3:48:38.540
 that's what a theorem prover is trying to do.

3:48:38.540 --> 3:48:40.780
 But I also mean like automated theorem.

3:48:40.780 --> 3:48:41.620
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:48:41.620 --> 3:48:42.440
 That's what, right.

3:48:42.440 --> 3:48:45.180
 So the finding of pods, the finding of shortest pods

3:48:45.180 --> 3:48:46.840
 or finding of pods at all

3:48:46.840 --> 3:48:48.780
 is what automated theorem provers do.

3:48:48.780 --> 3:48:51.020
 And actually what we've been doing.

3:48:51.020 --> 3:48:53.760
 So we've actually been using automated theorem proving

3:48:53.760 --> 3:48:56.340
 both in the physics project to prove things

3:48:56.340 --> 3:49:00.540
 and using that as a way to understand multiway graphs.

3:49:00.540 --> 3:49:04.080
 And because what an automated theorem prover is doing

3:49:04.080 --> 3:49:07.380
 is it's trying to find a path through a multiway graph

3:49:07.380 --> 3:49:09.300
 and its critical pair lemmas

3:49:09.300 --> 3:49:12.960
 are precisely little stubs of branch pairs

3:49:12.960 --> 3:49:15.080
 going off into branchial space.

3:49:15.080 --> 3:49:16.860
 And that's, I mean, it's really weird.

3:49:16.860 --> 3:49:19.100
 You know, we have these visualizations in Wolfram language

3:49:19.100 --> 3:49:24.100
 of proof graphs from our automated theorem proving system.

3:49:24.180 --> 3:49:25.660
 And they look reminiscent of.

3:49:25.660 --> 3:49:26.860
 Well, it's just bizarre

3:49:26.860 --> 3:49:28.820
 because we made these up a few years ago

3:49:28.820 --> 3:49:30.740
 and they have these little triangle things

3:49:30.740 --> 3:49:33.020
 and they are, we didn't quite get it right.

3:49:33.020 --> 3:49:35.100
 We didn't quite get the analogy perfectly right,

3:49:35.100 --> 3:49:36.220
 but it's very close.

3:49:36.220 --> 3:49:37.460
 You know, just to say,

3:49:37.460 --> 3:49:39.940
 in terms of how these things are connected.

3:49:39.940 --> 3:49:41.520
 So there's another bizarre connection

3:49:41.520 --> 3:49:46.160
 that I have to mention because which is,

3:49:46.160 --> 3:49:47.940
 which again, we don't fully know,

3:49:47.940 --> 3:49:51.140
 but it's a connection to something else

3:49:51.140 --> 3:49:52.660
 you might not have thought was in the slightest

3:49:52.660 --> 3:49:56.840
 but connected, which is distributed blockchain like things.

3:49:56.840 --> 3:49:58.140
 Now you might figure out that that's,

3:49:58.140 --> 3:49:59.900
 you would figure out that that's connected

3:49:59.900 --> 3:50:02.860
 because it's a story of distributed computing.

3:50:02.860 --> 3:50:04.860
 And the issue, you know, with the blockchain,

3:50:04.860 --> 3:50:07.580
 you're saying there's going to be this one ledger

3:50:07.580 --> 3:50:11.700
 that globally says, this is what happened in the world.

3:50:11.700 --> 3:50:14.000
 But that's a bad deal.

3:50:14.000 --> 3:50:15.640
 If you've got all these different transactions

3:50:15.640 --> 3:50:17.300
 that are happening and you know,

3:50:17.300 --> 3:50:20.660
 this transaction in country A

3:50:20.660 --> 3:50:23.380
 doesn't have to be reconciled with the transaction

3:50:23.380 --> 3:50:25.380
 in country B, at least not for a while.

3:50:26.220 --> 3:50:29.380
 And that story is just like what happens

3:50:29.380 --> 3:50:31.000
 with our causal graphs.

3:50:31.000 --> 3:50:33.220
 That whole reconciliation thing is just like

3:50:33.220 --> 3:50:35.740
 what happens with light cones and all this kind of thing.

3:50:35.740 --> 3:50:37.420
 That's where the causal awareness comes into play.

3:50:37.420 --> 3:50:39.180
 I mean, that's, you know,

3:50:39.180 --> 3:50:41.380
 most of your conversations are about physics,

3:50:41.380 --> 3:50:46.000
 but it's kind of funny that this probably

3:50:46.000 --> 3:50:49.340
 and possibly might have even bigger impact

3:50:49.340 --> 3:50:53.980
 and revolutionary ideas and totally other disciplines.

3:50:53.980 --> 3:50:55.400
 Right, well, you see, yeah, right.

3:50:55.400 --> 3:50:57.640
 So the question is, why is that happening, right?

3:50:57.640 --> 3:50:59.140
 And the reason it's happening,

3:50:59.140 --> 3:51:00.700
 I've thought about this obviously,

3:51:00.700 --> 3:51:03.300
 because I like to think about these meta questions of,

3:51:03.300 --> 3:51:06.380
 you know, what's happening is this model that we have

3:51:06.380 --> 3:51:08.740
 is an incredibly minimal model.

3:51:08.740 --> 3:51:11.360
 And once you have an incredibly minimal model,

3:51:11.360 --> 3:51:13.620
 and this happened with cellular automata as well,

3:51:13.620 --> 3:51:16.040
 cellular automata are an incredibly minimal model.

3:51:16.040 --> 3:51:19.100
 And so it's inevitable that it gets you,

3:51:19.100 --> 3:51:20.600
 it's sort of an upstream thing

3:51:20.600 --> 3:51:22.720
 that gets used in lots of different places.

3:51:22.720 --> 3:51:25.280
 And it's like, you know, the fact that it gets used,

3:51:25.280 --> 3:51:27.380
 you know, cellular automata is sort of a minimal model

3:51:27.380 --> 3:51:29.140
 of let's say road traffic flow or something.

3:51:29.140 --> 3:51:31.340
 And they're also a minimal model of something in,

3:51:31.340 --> 3:51:32.180
 you know, chemistry,

3:51:32.180 --> 3:51:33.560
 and they're also a minimal model of something

3:51:33.560 --> 3:51:35.860
 in epidemiology, right?

3:51:35.860 --> 3:51:38.140
 It's because they're such a simple model that they can,

3:51:38.140 --> 3:51:40.300
 that they apply to all these different things.

3:51:40.300 --> 3:51:43.060
 Similarly, this model that we have with the physics project

3:51:43.060 --> 3:51:47.300
 is another, cellular automata are a minimal model

3:51:47.300 --> 3:51:50.580
 of parallel, of basically of parallel computation

3:51:50.580 --> 3:51:52.840
 where you've defined space and time.

3:51:52.840 --> 3:51:54.820
 These models are minimal models

3:51:54.820 --> 3:51:57.180
 where you have not defined space and time.

3:51:57.180 --> 3:52:00.340
 And they have been very hard to understand in the past,

3:52:00.340 --> 3:52:01.980
 but the, I think the,

3:52:01.980 --> 3:52:04.500
 perhaps the most important breakthrough there

3:52:04.500 --> 3:52:07.440
 is the realization that these are models of physics.

3:52:07.440 --> 3:52:09.180
 And therefore that you can use everything

3:52:09.180 --> 3:52:11.140
 that's been developed in physics

3:52:11.140 --> 3:52:13.880
 to get intuition about how things like that work.

3:52:13.880 --> 3:52:17.500
 And that's why you can potentially use ideas from physics

3:52:17.500 --> 3:52:20.140
 to get intuition about how to do parallel computing.

3:52:20.140 --> 3:52:24.940
 And because the underlying model is the same.

3:52:24.940 --> 3:52:27.060
 But we have all of this achievement in physics.

3:52:27.060 --> 3:52:28.500
 I mean, you know, you might say,

3:52:28.500 --> 3:52:30.160
 oh, you've come up with the fundamental theory of physics

3:52:30.160 --> 3:52:32.500
 that throws out what people have done in physics before.

3:52:32.500 --> 3:52:35.540
 Well, it doesn't, but also the real power

3:52:35.540 --> 3:52:37.940
 is to use what's been done before in physics

3:52:37.940 --> 3:52:39.620
 to apply it in these other places.

3:52:39.620 --> 3:52:41.500
 Yes, absolutely.

3:52:41.500 --> 3:52:43.020
 This kind of brings up,

3:52:43.020 --> 3:52:47.900
 I know you probably don't particularly love commenting

3:52:47.900 --> 3:52:48.820
 on the work of others,

3:52:48.820 --> 3:52:51.260
 but let me bring up a couple of personalities

3:52:51.260 --> 3:52:53.660
 just because it's fun and people are curious about it.

3:52:53.660 --> 3:52:58.660
 So there's Sabine Hassenfelder.

3:52:58.700 --> 3:53:00.460
 I don't know if you're familiar with her.

3:53:00.460 --> 3:53:04.920
 She wrote this book that I need to read,

3:53:04.920 --> 3:53:06.980
 but I forget what the title is,

3:53:06.980 --> 3:53:10.480
 but it's Beauty Leads Us Astray in Physics

3:53:10.480 --> 3:53:12.420
 is a subtitle or something like that.

3:53:12.420 --> 3:53:15.100
 Which so much about what we're talking about now,

3:53:15.100 --> 3:53:16.540
 like this simplification,

3:53:17.860 --> 3:53:20.440
 to us humans seems to be beautiful.

3:53:20.440 --> 3:53:23.540
 Like there's a certain intuition with physicists,

3:53:23.540 --> 3:53:26.700
 with people that a simple theory,

3:53:26.700 --> 3:53:28.060
 like this reducibility,

3:53:28.060 --> 3:53:30.580
 pockets of reducibility is the ultimate goal.

3:53:30.580 --> 3:53:34.780
 And I think what she tries to argue is no,

3:53:34.780 --> 3:53:37.740
 we just need to come up with theories

3:53:37.740 --> 3:53:40.620
 that are just really good at predicting physical phenomena.

3:53:40.620 --> 3:53:44.360
 It's okay to have a bunch of disparate theories

3:53:44.360 --> 3:53:48.580
 as opposed to trying to chase this beautiful theory

3:53:48.580 --> 3:53:51.140
 of everything is the ultimate beautiful theory,

3:53:51.140 --> 3:53:52.140
 a simple one.

3:53:52.140 --> 3:53:54.620
 What's your response to that?

3:53:54.620 --> 3:53:56.340
 Well, so what you're quoting,

3:53:56.340 --> 3:53:59.820
 I don't know the Sabine Hassenfelder's,

3:53:59.820 --> 3:54:00.660
 exactly what she said,

3:54:00.660 --> 3:54:03.780
 but I mean that you're quoting the title of her book.

3:54:03.780 --> 3:54:04.620
 Okay.

3:54:04.620 --> 3:54:07.780
 Let me respond to what you were describing,

3:54:07.780 --> 3:54:09.620
 which may or may not have nothing to do with

3:54:09.620 --> 3:54:14.620
 what Sabine Hassenfelder says or thinks.

3:54:14.660 --> 3:54:15.500
 Sorry, Sabine.

3:54:16.460 --> 3:54:17.300
 Right.

3:54:17.300 --> 3:54:18.420
 Sorry for misquoting.

3:54:18.420 --> 3:54:21.300
 But I mean, the question is,

3:54:23.300 --> 3:54:26.540
 is beauty a guide to whether something is correct?

3:54:26.540 --> 3:54:29.180
 Which is kind of also the story of Occam's razor.

3:54:29.180 --> 3:54:32.140
 If you've got a bunch of different explanations of things,

3:54:32.140 --> 3:54:34.500
 is the thing that is the simplest explanation

3:54:34.500 --> 3:54:36.580
 likely to be the correct explanation?

3:54:36.580 --> 3:54:38.100
 And there are situations where that's true

3:54:38.100 --> 3:54:39.940
 and there are situations where it isn't true.

3:54:39.940 --> 3:54:41.900
 Sometimes in human systems, it is true

3:54:41.900 --> 3:54:43.140
 because people have kind of,

3:54:43.140 --> 3:54:45.220
 in evolutionary systems, sometimes it's true

3:54:45.220 --> 3:54:46.780
 because it's sort of been kicked

3:54:46.780 --> 3:54:49.340
 to the point where it's minimized.

3:54:49.340 --> 3:54:53.580
 But in physics, does Occam's razor work?

3:54:53.580 --> 3:54:57.420
 Is there a simple, quotes, beautiful explanation for things

3:54:57.420 --> 3:54:58.740
 or is it a big mess?

3:54:59.780 --> 3:55:01.940
 We don't intrinsically know.

3:55:01.940 --> 3:55:03.660
 I think that the, I wouldn't,

3:55:03.660 --> 3:55:07.180
 before I worked on the project in recent times,

3:55:07.180 --> 3:55:08.220
 I would have said,

3:55:08.220 --> 3:55:09.900
 we do not know how complicated

3:55:09.900 --> 3:55:12.100
 the rule for the universe will be.

3:55:12.100 --> 3:55:15.940
 And I would have said, the one thing we know,

3:55:15.940 --> 3:55:17.780
 which is a fundamental fact about science,

3:55:17.780 --> 3:55:19.740
 that's the thing that makes science possible,

3:55:19.740 --> 3:55:21.860
 is that there is order in the universe.

3:55:21.860 --> 3:55:24.860
 I mean, early theologians would have used that

3:55:24.860 --> 3:55:27.140
 as an argument for the existence of God

3:55:27.140 --> 3:55:29.420
 because it's like, why is there order in the universe?

3:55:29.420 --> 3:55:31.500
 Why doesn't every single particle in the universe

3:55:31.500 --> 3:55:32.620
 just do its own thing?

3:55:33.980 --> 3:55:37.180
 Something must be making there be order in the universe.

3:55:37.180 --> 3:55:41.820
 We, in the sort of early theology point of view,

3:55:41.820 --> 3:55:45.180
 that's the role of God is to do that, so to speak.

3:55:45.180 --> 3:55:47.580
 In our, we might say,

3:55:47.580 --> 3:55:50.140
 it's the role of a formal theory to do that.

3:55:50.140 --> 3:55:51.060
 And then the question is,

3:55:51.060 --> 3:55:53.260
 but how simple should that theory be?

3:55:53.260 --> 3:55:55.180
 And should that theory be one that,

3:55:57.060 --> 3:56:00.620
 where I think the point is, if it's simple,

3:56:00.620 --> 3:56:03.180
 it's almost inevitably somewhat beautiful

3:56:03.180 --> 3:56:06.460
 in the sense that, because all the stuff that we see

3:56:06.460 --> 3:56:08.740
 has to fit into this little tiny theory.

3:56:08.740 --> 3:56:11.380
 And the way it does that has to be,

3:56:11.380 --> 3:56:13.300
 it depends on your notion of beauty,

3:56:13.300 --> 3:56:17.940
 but I mean, for me, the sort of the surprising

3:56:17.940 --> 3:56:21.980
 connectivity of it is, at least in my aesthetic,

3:56:21.980 --> 3:56:25.100
 that's something that responds to my aesthetic.

3:56:25.100 --> 3:56:27.780
 But the question is, I mean,

3:56:27.780 --> 3:56:31.060
 you're a fascinating person in the sense that

3:56:31.060 --> 3:56:34.460
 you're at once talking about computational,

3:56:34.460 --> 3:56:37.940
 the fundamental computational reducibility of the universe,

3:56:37.940 --> 3:56:40.380
 and on the other hand,

3:56:40.380 --> 3:56:42.540
 trying to come up with a theory of everything,

3:56:42.540 --> 3:56:44.860
 which simply describes the,

3:56:47.740 --> 3:56:51.460
 the simple origins of that computational reducibility.

3:56:51.460 --> 3:56:53.820
 I mean, both of those things are kind of,

3:56:53.820 --> 3:56:56.340
 it's paralyzing to think that we can't make any sense

3:56:56.340 --> 3:56:58.580
 of the universe in the general case,

3:56:58.580 --> 3:57:01.060
 but it's hopeful to think like,

3:57:01.060 --> 3:57:03.060
 one, we can think of a rule

3:57:03.060 --> 3:57:05.980
 and that generates this whole complexity,

3:57:05.980 --> 3:57:10.980
 and two, we can find pockets of reducibility

3:57:10.980 --> 3:57:13.420
 that are powerful for everyday life

3:57:13.420 --> 3:57:15.540
 to do different kinds of predictions.

3:57:15.540 --> 3:57:19.060
 I suppose Sabine wants to find,

3:57:19.060 --> 3:57:22.940
 focus on the finding of small pockets of reducibility

3:57:22.940 --> 3:57:26.780
 versus the theory of everything.

3:57:26.780 --> 3:57:29.300
 You know, it's a funny thing because,

3:57:29.300 --> 3:57:30.780
 you know, a bunch of people have started working

3:57:30.780 --> 3:57:32.980
 on this physics project,

3:57:32.980 --> 3:57:35.860
 people who are physicists, basically,

3:57:36.780 --> 3:57:39.820
 and it is really a fascinating sociological phenomenon

3:57:39.820 --> 3:57:41.780
 because what, you know,

3:57:41.780 --> 3:57:45.300
 when I was working on this before in the 1990s,

3:57:45.300 --> 3:57:47.900
 you know, wrote it up, put it,

3:57:47.900 --> 3:57:50.060
 it's 100 pages of this 1200 page book

3:57:50.060 --> 3:57:51.300
 that I wrote, New Kind of Science,

3:57:51.300 --> 3:57:54.140
 is, you know, 100 pages of that is about physics,

3:57:54.140 --> 3:57:57.380
 but I saw it at that time,

3:57:57.380 --> 3:57:59.620
 not as a pinnacle achievement,

3:57:59.620 --> 3:58:01.820
 but rather as a use case, so to speak.

3:58:01.820 --> 3:58:04.100
 I mean, my main point was this new kind of science,

3:58:04.100 --> 3:58:05.940
 and it's like, you can apply it to biology,

3:58:05.940 --> 3:58:08.420
 you can apply it to, you know, other kinds of physics,

3:58:08.420 --> 3:58:09.900
 you can apply it to fundamental physics,

3:58:09.900 --> 3:58:12.420
 it's just an application, so to speak,

3:58:12.420 --> 3:58:14.740
 it's not the core thing.

3:58:14.740 --> 3:58:18.100
 But then, you know, one of the things that was interesting

3:58:18.100 --> 3:58:21.180
 with that book was, you know,

3:58:21.180 --> 3:58:24.580
 book comes out, lots of people think it's pretty interesting

3:58:24.580 --> 3:58:26.460
 and lots of people start using what it has

3:58:26.460 --> 3:58:28.100
 in different kinds of fields.

3:58:28.100 --> 3:58:32.500
 The one field where there was sort of a heavy pitchforking

3:58:32.500 --> 3:58:35.940
 was from my friends, the fundamental physics people,

3:58:35.940 --> 3:58:37.460
 which was, it's like, no,

3:58:37.460 --> 3:58:38.700
 this can't possibly be right.

3:58:38.700 --> 3:58:40.180
 And, you know, it's like, you know,

3:58:40.180 --> 3:58:41.540
 if what you're doing is right,

3:58:41.540 --> 3:58:44.220
 it'll overturn 50 years of what we've been doing.

3:58:44.220 --> 3:58:46.980
 And it's like, no, it won't, was what I was saying.

3:58:46.980 --> 3:58:50.820
 And it's like, but, you know, for a while,

3:58:50.820 --> 3:58:54.380
 when I started, you know, I was going to go on back in 2002,

3:58:54.380 --> 3:58:57.060
 well, 2004, actually, I was going to go on

3:58:57.060 --> 3:58:58.500
 working on this project.

3:58:58.500 --> 3:58:59.820
 And I actually stopped,

3:58:59.820 --> 3:59:03.100
 partly because it's like, why am I, you know,

3:59:03.100 --> 3:59:05.380
 this is like, I've been in business a long time, right?

3:59:05.380 --> 3:59:08.100
 I'm building a product for a target market

3:59:08.100 --> 3:59:09.700
 that doesn't want the product.

3:59:09.700 --> 3:59:10.700
 And it's like.

3:59:10.700 --> 3:59:13.260
 Why work, yeah, yeah, why work against the,

3:59:13.260 --> 3:59:14.620
 swim against the current or whatever.

3:59:14.620 --> 3:59:16.100
 Right, but you see what's happened,

3:59:16.100 --> 3:59:18.060
 which is sort of interesting is that,

3:59:18.060 --> 3:59:21.540
 so a couple of things happened and it was like,

3:59:22.580 --> 3:59:25.700
 you know, it was like, I don't want to do this project

3:59:25.700 --> 3:59:28.540
 because I can do so many other things,

3:59:28.540 --> 3:59:31.820
 which I'm really interested in where, you know,

3:59:31.820 --> 3:59:34.100
 people say, great, thanks for those tools.

3:59:34.100 --> 3:59:36.380
 Thanks for those ideas, et cetera.

3:59:36.380 --> 3:59:40.020
 Whereas, you know, if you're dealing with kind of a,

3:59:40.020 --> 3:59:42.820
 you know, a sort of a structure where people are saying,

3:59:42.820 --> 3:59:44.220
 no, no, we don't want this new stuff.

3:59:44.220 --> 3:59:45.300
 We don't need any new stuff.

3:59:45.300 --> 3:59:46.660
 We're really fine with what we're doing.

3:59:46.660 --> 3:59:48.300
 Yeah, there's like literally like, I don't know,

3:59:48.300 --> 3:59:51.140
 millions of people who are thankful for Wolfram Alpha.

3:59:51.140 --> 3:59:53.260
 A bunch of people wrote to me, how thankful,

3:59:53.260 --> 3:59:55.460
 they are a different crowd

3:59:55.460 --> 3:59:57.820
 than the theoretical physics community, perhaps.

3:59:57.820 --> 3:59:58.900
 Yeah, well, but you know,

3:59:58.900 --> 4:00:00.260
 the theoretical physics community

4:00:00.260 --> 4:00:03.180
 pretty much uniformly uses Wolfram language

4:00:03.180 --> 4:00:04.380
 and Mathematica, right?

4:00:04.380 --> 4:00:08.340
 And so it's kind of like, you know, and that's,

4:00:08.340 --> 4:00:11.180
 but the thing is what happens, you know,

4:00:11.180 --> 4:00:14.980
 this is what happens, mature fields do not, you know,

4:00:14.980 --> 4:00:16.420
 it's like, we're doing what we're doing.

4:00:16.420 --> 4:00:18.220
 We have the methods that we have

4:00:18.220 --> 4:00:20.220
 and we're just fine here.

4:00:20.220 --> 4:00:23.380
 Now what's happened in the last 18 years or so,

4:00:23.380 --> 4:00:25.460
 I think there's a couple of things have happened.

4:00:25.460 --> 4:00:29.260
 First of all, the hope that, you know,

4:00:29.260 --> 4:00:31.300
 string theory or whatever would deliver

4:00:31.300 --> 4:00:32.460
 the fundamental theory of physics,

4:00:32.460 --> 4:00:34.540
 that hope has disappeared.

4:00:34.540 --> 4:00:36.820
 That the, another thing that's happened

4:00:36.820 --> 4:00:41.020
 is the sort of the interest in computation around physics

4:00:41.020 --> 4:00:42.460
 has been greatly enhanced

4:00:42.460 --> 4:00:44.020
 by the whole quantum information,

4:00:44.020 --> 4:00:46.020
 quantum computing story.

4:00:46.020 --> 4:00:47.940
 People, you know, the idea there might be something

4:00:47.940 --> 4:00:51.100
 sort of computational related to physics

4:00:51.100 --> 4:00:53.060
 has somehow grown.

4:00:53.060 --> 4:00:55.820
 And I think, you know, it's sort of interesting.

4:00:55.820 --> 4:00:58.060
 I mean, right now, if we say, you know,

4:00:58.060 --> 4:00:59.700
 it's like, if you're like,

4:00:59.700 --> 4:01:00.820
 who else is trying to come up

4:01:00.820 --> 4:01:02.420
 with the fundamental theory of physics?

4:01:02.420 --> 4:01:04.460
 It's like, there aren't professional,

4:01:04.460 --> 4:01:07.220
 no professional physicists, no professional physicists.

4:01:07.220 --> 4:01:10.820
 What are your, I mean, you've talked with him,

4:01:10.820 --> 4:01:12.820
 but just as a matter of personalities,

4:01:12.820 --> 4:01:13.820
 cause it's a beautiful story.

4:01:13.820 --> 4:01:17.100
 What are your thoughts about Eric Weinstein's work?

4:01:17.100 --> 4:01:20.580
 You know, I think his, I mean,

4:01:20.580 --> 4:01:23.420
 he did a PhD thesis in mathematical physics at Harvard.

4:01:23.420 --> 4:01:24.580
 He's a mathematical physicist.

4:01:24.580 --> 4:01:28.900
 And, you know, it seems like it's kind of,

4:01:28.900 --> 4:01:30.940
 you know, it's in that framework.

4:01:30.940 --> 4:01:32.820
 And it's kind of like,

4:01:32.820 --> 4:01:35.940
 I'm not sure how much further it's got than his PhD thesis,

4:01:35.940 --> 4:01:37.580
 which was 20 years ago or something.

4:01:37.580 --> 4:01:40.740
 And I think that, you know, the, you know,

4:01:40.740 --> 4:01:43.780
 it's a fairly specific piece of mathematical physics.

4:01:43.780 --> 4:01:44.940
 That's quite nice.

4:01:44.940 --> 4:01:45.780
 And...

4:01:45.780 --> 4:01:47.540
 What trajectory do you hope it takes?

4:01:47.540 --> 4:01:48.620
 I mean...

4:01:48.620 --> 4:01:50.100
 Well, I think in his particular case,

4:01:50.100 --> 4:01:51.380
 I mean, from what I understand,

4:01:51.380 --> 4:01:52.940
 which is not everything at all,

4:01:52.940 --> 4:01:54.820
 but, you know, I think I know the rough tradition,

4:01:54.820 --> 4:01:58.980
 at least what he's operating in is sort of theory of gauge theories.

4:01:58.980 --> 4:01:59.740
 Gauge theories, yeah.

4:01:59.740 --> 4:02:01.100
 Local gauge invariants and so on.

4:02:01.100 --> 4:02:04.180
 Okay, we are very close to understanding

4:02:04.180 --> 4:02:06.220
 how local gauge invariants works in our models.

4:02:06.220 --> 4:02:07.620
 And it's very beautiful.

4:02:07.620 --> 4:02:09.420
 And it's very...

4:02:09.420 --> 4:02:12.260
 And, you know, does some of the mathematical structure

4:02:12.260 --> 4:02:14.340
 that he's enthusiastic about fit?

4:02:14.340 --> 4:02:15.820
 Quite possibly, yes.

4:02:15.820 --> 4:02:17.740
 So there might be a possibility of trying to understand

4:02:17.740 --> 4:02:19.780
 how those things fit, how gauge theory fits.

4:02:19.780 --> 4:02:20.620
 Yeah, very well.

4:02:20.620 --> 4:02:21.980
 I mean, the question is, you know,

4:02:21.980 --> 4:02:22.820
 so there are a couple of things

4:02:22.820 --> 4:02:24.100
 one might try to get in the world.

4:02:24.100 --> 4:02:25.660
 So for example, it's like,

4:02:25.660 --> 4:02:27.100
 can we get three dimensions of space?

4:02:27.100 --> 4:02:28.860
 We haven't managed to get that yet.

4:02:28.860 --> 4:02:32.380
 Gauge theory, the standard model of particle physics says,

4:02:32.380 --> 4:02:35.620
 but it's SU3 cross SU2 cross U1.

4:02:35.620 --> 4:02:39.980
 Those are the designations of these Lie groups.

4:02:39.980 --> 4:02:41.340
 It doesn't, but anyway,

4:02:41.340 --> 4:02:43.700
 so those are sort of representations

4:02:43.700 --> 4:02:46.460
 of symmetries of the theory.

4:02:46.460 --> 4:02:50.060
 And so, you know, it is conceivable

4:02:50.060 --> 4:02:52.660
 that it is generically true.

4:02:52.660 --> 4:02:55.340
 Okay, so all those are subgroups of a group called E8,

4:02:55.340 --> 4:02:59.620
 which is a weird, exceptional Lie group, okay?

4:02:59.620 --> 4:03:02.100
 It is conceivable, I don't know whether it's the case,

4:03:02.100 --> 4:03:05.100
 that that will be generic in these models,

4:03:05.100 --> 4:03:06.780
 that it will be generic,

4:03:06.780 --> 4:03:11.780
 that the gauge invariance of the model has this property,

4:03:12.020 --> 4:03:15.100
 just as things like general relativity,

4:03:15.100 --> 4:03:20.100
 which corresponds to the thing called general covariance,

4:03:20.100 --> 4:03:23.100
 which is another gauge like invariance.

4:03:23.100 --> 4:03:25.340
 It could conceivably be the case

4:03:25.340 --> 4:03:27.460
 that the kind of local gauge invariance

4:03:27.460 --> 4:03:30.580
 that we see in particle physics is somehow generic.

4:03:30.580 --> 4:03:32.300
 And that would be a, you know,

4:03:32.300 --> 4:03:35.380
 the thing that's really cool, I think, you know,

4:03:35.380 --> 4:03:38.100
 sociologically, although this hasn't really hit yet,

4:03:38.100 --> 4:03:40.020
 is that all of these different things,

4:03:40.020 --> 4:03:41.660
 all these different things people have been working on

4:03:41.660 --> 4:03:43.260
 in these, in some cases,

4:03:43.260 --> 4:03:46.500
 quite abstruse areas of mathematical physics,

4:03:46.500 --> 4:03:49.420
 an awful lot of them seem to tie into what we're doing.

4:03:49.420 --> 4:03:51.460
 And, you know, it might not be that way.

4:03:51.460 --> 4:03:52.300
 Yeah, absolutely.

4:03:52.300 --> 4:03:53.740
 That's a beautiful thing, I think.

4:03:53.740 --> 4:03:58.100
 I mean, but the reason Eric Weinstein is important

4:03:58.100 --> 4:04:00.180
 is to the point that you mentioned before,

4:04:00.180 --> 4:04:04.380
 which is, it's strange that the theory of everything

4:04:04.380 --> 4:04:09.380
 is not at the core of the passion, the dream,

4:04:09.780 --> 4:04:14.140
 the focus, the funding of the physics community.

4:04:14.140 --> 4:04:15.100
 It's too hard.

4:04:16.420 --> 4:04:17.980
 It's too hard and people gave up.

4:04:17.980 --> 4:04:21.420
 I mean, basically what happened is ancient Greece,

4:04:21.420 --> 4:04:23.060
 people thought we're nearly there.

4:04:23.060 --> 4:04:25.100
 You know, the world is made of platonic solids.

4:04:25.100 --> 4:04:27.700
 It's, you know, water is a tetrahedron or something.

4:04:27.700 --> 4:04:29.700
 We're almost there, okay?

4:04:29.700 --> 4:04:32.180
 Long period of time where people were like,

4:04:32.180 --> 4:04:34.020
 no, we don't know how it works.

4:04:34.020 --> 4:04:36.980
 You know, time of Newton, you know, we're almost there.

4:04:36.980 --> 4:04:38.740
 Everything is gravitation.

4:04:38.740 --> 4:04:42.380
 You know, time of Faraday and Maxwell, we're almost there.

4:04:42.380 --> 4:04:45.500
 Everything is fields, everything is the ether, you know?

4:04:45.500 --> 4:04:46.340
 Then...

4:04:46.340 --> 4:04:48.940
 And the whole time we're making big progress though.

4:04:48.940 --> 4:04:50.140
 Oh yes, absolutely.

4:04:50.140 --> 4:04:53.860
 But the fundamental theory of physics is almost a footnote

4:04:53.860 --> 4:04:56.900
 because it's like, it's the machine code.

4:04:56.900 --> 4:04:59.340
 It's like we're operating in the high level languages.

4:04:59.340 --> 4:05:00.180
 Yeah.

4:05:00.180 --> 4:05:01.700
 You know, that's what we really care about.

4:05:01.700 --> 4:05:03.660
 That's what's relevant for our everyday physics.

4:05:03.660 --> 4:05:05.020
 You talked about different centuries

4:05:05.020 --> 4:05:08.820
 and the 21st century will be everything is computation.

4:05:08.820 --> 4:05:09.660
 Yes.

4:05:09.660 --> 4:05:11.500
 If that takes us all the way, we don't know,

4:05:11.500 --> 4:05:13.260
 but it might take us pretty far.

4:05:13.260 --> 4:05:14.580
 Yes, right, that's right.

4:05:14.580 --> 4:05:17.060
 And I, but I think the point is that it's like, you know,

4:05:17.060 --> 4:05:18.700
 if you're doing biology, you might say,

4:05:18.700 --> 4:05:21.140
 how can you not be really interested in the origin of life

4:05:21.140 --> 4:05:22.700
 and the definition of life?

4:05:22.700 --> 4:05:23.540
 Well, it's irrelevant.

4:05:23.540 --> 4:05:26.020
 You know, you're studying the properties of some virus.

4:05:26.020 --> 4:05:28.020
 It doesn't matter, you know, where, you know,

4:05:28.020 --> 4:05:30.620
 you're operating at some much higher level.

4:05:30.620 --> 4:05:34.180
 And it's the same, what's happening with physics is,

4:05:34.180 --> 4:05:35.420
 I was sort of surprised actually.

4:05:35.420 --> 4:05:38.780
 I was sort of mapping out this history of people's efforts

4:05:38.780 --> 4:05:41.180
 to understand the fundamental theory of physics.

4:05:41.180 --> 4:05:45.220
 And it's remarkable how little has been done on this question.

4:05:45.220 --> 4:05:47.100
 And it's, you know, because, you know,

4:05:47.100 --> 4:05:49.340
 there've been times when there's been bursts of enthusiasm.

4:05:49.340 --> 4:05:50.940
 Oh, we're almost there.

4:05:50.940 --> 4:05:54.940
 And then it decays and people just say,

4:05:54.940 --> 4:05:57.260
 oh, it's too hard, but it's not relevant anyway.

4:05:57.260 --> 4:06:01.140
 And I think that the thing that, you know,

4:06:01.140 --> 4:06:04.860
 so the question of, you know, one question is,

4:06:04.860 --> 4:06:07.420
 why does anybody, why should anybody care, right?

4:06:07.420 --> 4:06:08.500
 Why should anybody care

4:06:08.500 --> 4:06:10.420
 what the fundamental theory of physics is?

4:06:10.420 --> 4:06:13.140
 I think it's intellectually interesting,

4:06:13.140 --> 4:06:14.820
 but what will be the sort of,

4:06:14.820 --> 4:06:16.460
 what will be the impact of this?

4:06:16.460 --> 4:06:18.900
 What, I mean, this is the key question.

4:06:18.900 --> 4:06:20.660
 What do you think will happen

4:06:20.660 --> 4:06:25.260
 if we figure out the fundamental theory of physics?

4:06:25.260 --> 4:06:26.100
 Right.

4:06:26.100 --> 4:06:28.140
 Outside of the intellectual curiosity of us.

4:06:28.140 --> 4:06:31.340
 Okay, so here's my best guess, okay?

4:06:31.340 --> 4:06:33.540
 So if you look at the history of science,

4:06:33.540 --> 4:06:37.420
 I think a very interesting analogy is Copernicus.

4:06:37.420 --> 4:06:39.740
 Okay, so what did Copernicus do?

4:06:39.740 --> 4:06:41.340
 There'd been this Ptolemaic system

4:06:41.340 --> 4:06:43.260
 for working out the motion of planets.

4:06:43.260 --> 4:06:44.740
 It did pretty well.

4:06:44.740 --> 4:06:47.100
 It used epicycles, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

4:06:47.100 --> 4:06:49.340
 It had all this computational ways

4:06:49.340 --> 4:06:51.180
 of working out where planets will be.

4:06:51.180 --> 4:06:52.740
 When we work out where planets are today,

4:06:52.740 --> 4:06:54.860
 we're basically using epicycles.

4:06:54.860 --> 4:06:58.060
 But Copernicus had this different way of formulating things

4:06:58.060 --> 4:07:00.260
 in which he said, you know,

4:07:00.260 --> 4:07:02.980
 and the earth is going around the sun,

4:07:02.980 --> 4:07:04.180
 and that had a consequence.

4:07:04.180 --> 4:07:07.900
 The consequence was you can use this mathematical theory

4:07:07.900 --> 4:07:10.740
 to conclude something which is absolutely not

4:07:10.740 --> 4:07:14.180
 what we can tell from common sense, right?

4:07:14.180 --> 4:07:18.420
 So it's like, trust the mathematics, trust the science, okay?

4:07:18.420 --> 4:07:21.060
 Now fast forward 400 years,

4:07:21.060 --> 4:07:23.900
 and now we're in this pandemic,

4:07:23.900 --> 4:07:26.500
 and it's kind of like everybody thinks the science

4:07:26.500 --> 4:07:28.260
 will figure out everything.

4:07:28.260 --> 4:07:30.020
 It's like from the science,

4:07:30.020 --> 4:07:31.380
 we can just figure out what to do.

4:07:31.380 --> 4:07:32.940
 We can figure out everything.

4:07:32.940 --> 4:07:34.820
 That was before Copernicus.

4:07:34.820 --> 4:07:37.700
 Nobody would have thought if the science says something

4:07:37.700 --> 4:07:40.780
 that doesn't agree with our everyday experience,

4:07:40.780 --> 4:07:43.180
 where we just have to compute the science

4:07:43.180 --> 4:07:44.420
 and then figure out what to do,

4:07:44.420 --> 4:07:46.380
 people would say that's completely crazy.

4:07:46.380 --> 4:07:47.580
 And so your sense is,

4:07:47.580 --> 4:07:49.820
 once we figure out the framework of computation

4:07:49.820 --> 4:07:51.780
 that can basically do any,

4:07:51.780 --> 4:07:53.780
 understand the fabric of reality,

4:07:53.780 --> 4:07:58.780
 we'll be able to derive totally counterintuitive things.

4:07:58.900 --> 4:08:01.580
 No, the point I think is the following.

4:08:01.580 --> 4:08:03.020
 That right now, you know,

4:08:03.020 --> 4:08:05.740
 I talk about computational irreducibility.

4:08:05.740 --> 4:08:07.820
 People, you know, I was very proud

4:08:07.820 --> 4:08:10.140
 that I managed to get the term computational irreducibility

4:08:10.140 --> 4:08:13.020
 into the congressional record last year.

4:08:13.020 --> 4:08:13.860
 That's right, by the way,

4:08:13.860 --> 4:08:15.460
 that's a whole nother topic we could talk about.

4:08:15.460 --> 4:08:17.140
 Fascinating. Different topic.

4:08:17.140 --> 4:08:18.180
 Different topic.

4:08:18.180 --> 4:08:20.420
 But Tim, in any case, you know,

4:08:20.420 --> 4:08:22.140
 but so computational irreducibility

4:08:22.140 --> 4:08:23.900
 is one of these sort of concepts

4:08:23.900 --> 4:08:25.420
 that I think is important in understanding

4:08:25.420 --> 4:08:26.980
 lots of things in the world.

4:08:26.980 --> 4:08:29.180
 But the question is, it's only important

4:08:29.180 --> 4:08:32.100
 if you believe the world is fundamentally computational.

4:08:32.100 --> 4:08:33.140
 Right?

4:08:33.140 --> 4:08:35.940
 But if you know the fundamental theory of physics

4:08:35.940 --> 4:08:38.260
 and it's fundamentally computational,

4:08:38.260 --> 4:08:40.180
 then you've rooted the whole thing.

4:08:40.180 --> 4:08:43.140
 That is, you know the world is computational.

4:08:43.140 --> 4:08:47.260
 And while you can discuss whether, you know,

4:08:47.260 --> 4:08:48.820
 it's not the case that people would say,

4:08:48.820 --> 4:08:50.940
 well, you have this whole computational irreducibility,

4:08:50.940 --> 4:08:52.580
 all these features of computation.

4:08:52.580 --> 4:08:54.100
 We don't care about those

4:08:54.100 --> 4:08:56.180
 because after all the world isn't computational,

4:08:56.180 --> 4:08:57.300
 you might say.

4:08:57.300 --> 4:09:01.260
 But if you know, you know, base, base, base thing,

4:09:01.260 --> 4:09:03.220
 physics is computational,

4:09:03.220 --> 4:09:05.540
 then you know that that stuff is, you know,

4:09:05.540 --> 4:09:07.700
 that that's kind of the grounding for that stuff.

4:09:07.700 --> 4:09:10.540
 Just as in a sense Copernicus was the grounding

4:09:10.540 --> 4:09:12.900
 for the idea that you could figure out something

4:09:12.900 --> 4:09:14.620
 with math and science

4:09:14.620 --> 4:09:18.820
 that was not what you would intuitively think

4:09:18.820 --> 4:09:20.100
 from your senses.

4:09:20.100 --> 4:09:22.780
 So now we've got to this point where, for example,

4:09:22.780 --> 4:09:25.220
 we say, you know, once we have the idea

4:09:25.220 --> 4:09:27.940
 that computation is the foundational thing

4:09:27.940 --> 4:09:30.100
 that explains our whole universe,

4:09:30.100 --> 4:09:32.020
 then we have to say, well, what does it mean

4:09:32.020 --> 4:09:32.860
 for other things?

4:09:32.860 --> 4:09:35.220
 Like it means there's computational irreducibility.

4:09:35.220 --> 4:09:37.860
 That means science is limited in certain ways.

4:09:37.860 --> 4:09:39.740
 That means this, that means that.

4:09:39.740 --> 4:09:43.260
 But the fact that we have that grounding means that,

4:09:43.260 --> 4:09:45.660
 you know, and I think, for example, for Copernicus,

4:09:45.660 --> 4:09:49.140
 for instance, the implications of his work

4:09:49.140 --> 4:09:52.340
 on the set of mathematics of astronomy were cool,

4:09:52.340 --> 4:09:54.540
 but they involved a very small number of people.

4:09:54.540 --> 4:09:56.900
 The implications of his work for sort of the philosophy

4:09:56.900 --> 4:09:59.820
 of how you think about things were vast

4:09:59.820 --> 4:10:02.820
 and involved, you know, everybody more or less.

4:10:02.820 --> 4:10:05.740
 But do you think, so that's actually the way scientists

4:10:05.740 --> 4:10:08.540
 and people see the world around us.

4:10:08.540 --> 4:10:10.580
 So it has a huge impact in that sense.

4:10:10.580 --> 4:10:14.220
 Do you think it might have an impact more directly

4:10:14.220 --> 4:10:18.100
 to engineering derivations from physics,

4:10:18.100 --> 4:10:21.980
 like propulsion systems, our ability to colonize the world?

4:10:21.980 --> 4:10:24.580
 Like, for example, okay, this is like sci fi,

4:10:24.580 --> 4:10:29.580
 but if you understand the computational nature, say,

4:10:30.420 --> 4:10:34.300
 of the different forces of physics, you know,

4:10:34.300 --> 4:10:38.420
 there's a notion of being able to warp gravity,

4:10:38.420 --> 4:10:39.260
 things like this.

4:10:39.260 --> 4:10:40.500
 Yeah, can we make warp drive?

4:10:40.500 --> 4:10:41.700
 Warp drive, yeah.

4:10:41.700 --> 4:10:45.660
 So like, would we be able to, will, you know,

4:10:45.660 --> 4:10:47.580
 will like Elon Musk start paying attention?

4:10:47.580 --> 4:10:50.460
 Like it's awfully costly to launch these rockets.

4:10:50.460 --> 4:10:52.820
 Do you think we'll be able to, yeah, create warp drive?

4:10:52.820 --> 4:10:55.340
 And, you know, I set myself some homework.

4:10:55.340 --> 4:10:57.580
 I agreed to give a talk at some NASA workshop

4:10:57.580 --> 4:10:59.860
 in a few weeks about faster than light travel.

4:10:59.860 --> 4:11:02.700
 So I haven't figured it out yet, but no, but.

4:11:02.700 --> 4:11:03.540
 You got two weeks.

4:11:03.540 --> 4:11:04.380
 Yeah, right.

4:11:04.380 --> 4:11:06.260
 But do you think that kind of understanding

4:11:06.260 --> 4:11:07.980
 of fundamental theory of physics can lead

4:11:07.980 --> 4:11:09.540
 to those engineering breakthroughs?

4:11:09.540 --> 4:11:12.020
 Okay, I think it's far away, but I'm not certain.

4:11:12.020 --> 4:11:14.660
 I mean, you know, this is the thing that,

4:11:14.660 --> 4:11:16.940
 I set myself an exercise when gravity waves,

4:11:16.940 --> 4:11:19.220
 gravitational waves were discovered, right?

4:11:19.220 --> 4:11:22.020
 I set myself the exercise of what would black hole

4:11:22.020 --> 4:11:23.780
 technology look like?

4:11:23.780 --> 4:11:25.260
 In other words, right now, you know,

4:11:25.260 --> 4:11:26.420
 black holes are far away.

4:11:26.420 --> 4:11:28.100
 They're, you know, how on earth can we do things with them?

4:11:28.100 --> 4:11:30.060
 But just imagine that we could get, you know,

4:11:30.060 --> 4:11:32.460
 pet black holes right in our backyard.

4:11:32.460 --> 4:11:34.500
 You know, what kind of technology could we build with them?

4:11:34.500 --> 4:11:36.700
 I got a certain distance, not that far,

4:11:36.700 --> 4:11:40.020
 but I think in, you know, so there are ideas, you know,

4:11:40.020 --> 4:11:42.340
 I have this, one of the weirder ideas is things

4:11:42.340 --> 4:11:44.140
 I'm calling space tunnels,

4:11:44.140 --> 4:11:47.820
 which are higher dimensional pieces of space time,

4:11:47.820 --> 4:11:50.020
 where basically you can, you know,

4:11:50.020 --> 4:11:51.980
 in our three dimensional space,

4:11:51.980 --> 4:11:54.620
 there might be a five dimensional, you know,

4:11:54.620 --> 4:11:57.020
 region, which actually will appear as a white hole

4:11:57.020 --> 4:11:59.300
 at one end and a black hole at the other end,

4:11:59.300 --> 4:12:01.060
 you know, who knows whether they exist.

4:12:01.060 --> 4:12:02.700
 And then the questions, another one,

4:12:02.700 --> 4:12:04.420
 okay, this is another crazy one,

4:12:04.420 --> 4:12:07.620
 is the thing that I'm calling a vacuum cleaner, okay?

4:12:07.620 --> 4:12:10.620
 So, I mentioned that, you know,

4:12:10.620 --> 4:12:12.580
 there's all this activity in the universe,

4:12:12.580 --> 4:12:14.980
 which is maintaining the structure of space.

4:12:14.980 --> 4:12:18.260
 And that leads to a certain energy density

4:12:18.260 --> 4:12:20.100
 effectively in space.

4:12:20.100 --> 4:12:23.620
 And so the question, in fact, dark energy

4:12:23.620 --> 4:12:26.820
 is a story of essentially negative mass

4:12:26.820 --> 4:12:30.900
 produced by the absence of energy

4:12:30.900 --> 4:12:33.180
 you thought would be there, so to speak.

4:12:33.180 --> 4:12:34.820
 And we don't know exactly how it works

4:12:34.820 --> 4:12:37.700
 in either our model or the physical universe,

4:12:37.700 --> 4:12:41.860
 but this notion of a vacuum cleaner is a thing where,

4:12:41.860 --> 4:12:43.060
 you know, you have all these things

4:12:43.060 --> 4:12:44.500
 that are maintaining the structure of space,

4:12:44.500 --> 4:12:47.580
 but what if you could clean out some of that stuff

4:12:47.580 --> 4:12:49.460
 that's maintaining the structure of space

4:12:49.460 --> 4:12:51.860
 and make a simpler vacuum somewhere?

4:12:51.860 --> 4:12:52.700
 You know, what would that do?

4:12:52.700 --> 4:12:54.220
 A totally different kind of vacuum.

4:12:54.220 --> 4:12:57.180
 Right, and that would lead to negative energy density,

4:12:57.180 --> 4:12:59.420
 which would need to, so gravity is usually

4:12:59.420 --> 4:13:02.420
 a purely attractive force, but negative mass

4:13:02.420 --> 4:13:06.180
 would lead to repulsive gravity

4:13:06.180 --> 4:13:08.540
 and lead to all kinds of weird things.

4:13:08.540 --> 4:13:11.220
 Now, can it be done in our universe?

4:13:11.220 --> 4:13:14.820
 You know, my immediate thought is no,

4:13:14.820 --> 4:13:18.420
 but you know, the fact is that, okay, so here's the thing.

4:13:18.420 --> 4:13:19.620
 Well, once you understand the fact,

4:13:19.620 --> 4:13:21.580
 because you're saying like, at this level of abstraction,

4:13:21.580 --> 4:13:25.420
 can we reach to the lower levels and mess with it?

4:13:25.420 --> 4:13:26.260
 Yes.

4:13:26.260 --> 4:13:27.940
 Once you understand the levels, I think you can start to.

4:13:27.940 --> 4:13:30.700
 I know, and I'm, you know, I have to say

4:13:30.700 --> 4:13:34.660
 that this reminds me of people telling one years ago

4:13:34.660 --> 4:13:36.300
 that, you know, you'll never transmit data

4:13:36.300 --> 4:13:38.740
 over a copper wire at more than 1,000,

4:13:38.740 --> 4:13:41.460
 you know, 1,000 board or something, right?

4:13:41.460 --> 4:13:43.940
 And this is, why did that not happen?

4:13:43.940 --> 4:13:45.580
 You know, why do we have this much,

4:13:45.580 --> 4:13:46.940
 much faster data transmission?

4:13:46.940 --> 4:13:48.820
 Because we've understood many more of the details

4:13:48.820 --> 4:13:50.380
 of what's actually going on.

4:13:50.380 --> 4:13:52.540
 And it's the same exact story here.

4:13:52.540 --> 4:13:54.740
 And it's the same, you know, I think that this,

4:13:54.740 --> 4:13:58.580
 as I say, I think one of the features of sort of,

4:13:58.580 --> 4:14:00.540
 one of the things about our time

4:14:00.540 --> 4:14:03.020
 that will seem incredibly naive in the future

4:14:03.020 --> 4:14:06.220
 is the belief that, you know, things like heat

4:14:06.220 --> 4:14:08.380
 is just random motion of molecules,

4:14:08.380 --> 4:14:12.460
 that it's just throw up your hands, it's just random.

4:14:12.460 --> 4:14:14.060
 We can't say anything about it.

4:14:14.060 --> 4:14:15.660
 That will seem naive.

4:14:15.660 --> 4:14:18.100
 Yeah, at the heat death of the universe,

4:14:18.100 --> 4:14:20.980
 those particles would be laughing at us humans thinking.

4:14:20.980 --> 4:14:22.380
 Yes, right.

4:14:22.380 --> 4:14:23.220
 That life is not beautiful.

4:14:23.220 --> 4:14:25.900
 I'll have a whole civilization, you know.

4:14:25.900 --> 4:14:27.580
 Humans used to think they're special

4:14:27.580 --> 4:14:28.980
 with their little brains.

4:14:28.980 --> 4:14:31.260
 Well, right, but also, and they used to think

4:14:31.260 --> 4:14:33.940
 that this would just be random and uninteresting.

4:14:33.940 --> 4:14:37.620
 But that's, but so this question about whether you can,

4:14:37.620 --> 4:14:39.980
 you know, mess with the underlying structure

4:14:39.980 --> 4:14:42.860
 and how you find a way to mess with the underlying structure,

4:14:42.860 --> 4:14:45.660
 that's a, you know, I have to say, you know,

4:14:45.660 --> 4:14:48.820
 my immediate thing is, boy, that seems really hard,

4:14:48.820 --> 4:14:50.980
 but then, and you know,

4:14:50.980 --> 4:14:54.020
 possibly computational irreducibility will bite you,

4:14:54.020 --> 4:14:55.540
 but then there's always some path

4:14:55.540 --> 4:14:57.380
 of computational reducibility.

4:14:57.380 --> 4:14:59.740
 And that path of computational reducibility

4:14:59.740 --> 4:15:02.540
 is the engineering invention that has to be made.

4:15:02.540 --> 4:15:05.980
 Those little pockets can have huge engineering impact.

4:15:05.980 --> 4:15:07.780
 Right, and I think that that's right.

4:15:07.780 --> 4:15:10.380
 And I mean, we live in, you know, we make use of so many

4:15:10.380 --> 4:15:11.420
 of those pockets.

4:15:11.420 --> 4:15:16.420
 And the fact is, you know, I, you know, this is, yes,

4:15:16.980 --> 4:15:20.380
 it's a, you know, it's one of these things where,

4:15:20.380 --> 4:15:24.740
 where, you know, I'm a person who likes to figure out ideas

4:15:24.740 --> 4:15:28.060
 and so on, and the sort of tests of my level of imagination,

4:15:28.060 --> 4:15:29.180
 so to speak.

4:15:29.180 --> 4:15:32.700
 And so a couple of places where there's sort of serious

4:15:32.700 --> 4:15:35.460
 humility in terms of my level of imagination,

4:15:35.460 --> 4:15:38.220
 one is this thing about different reference frames

4:15:38.220 --> 4:15:39.860
 for understanding the universe,

4:15:39.860 --> 4:15:42.260
 where like, imagine the physics of the aliens,

4:15:42.260 --> 4:15:43.660
 what will it be like?

4:15:43.660 --> 4:15:45.780
 And I'm like, that's really hard.

4:15:45.780 --> 4:15:47.500
 I don't know, you know?

4:15:47.500 --> 4:15:48.340
 And I mean, I think that...

4:15:48.340 --> 4:15:49.980
 But once you have the framework in place,

4:15:49.980 --> 4:15:53.940
 you can at least reason about the things you don't know,

4:15:53.940 --> 4:15:57.620
 maybe can't know, or like, it's too hard for you to know,

4:15:57.620 --> 4:16:01.620
 but then the mathematics can, that's exactly it,

4:16:01.620 --> 4:16:05.900
 allow you to reach beyond where you can reason about.

4:16:05.900 --> 4:16:09.340
 So I'm, you know, I'm trying to not have, you know,

4:16:09.340 --> 4:16:11.660
 if you think back to Alan Turing, for example,

4:16:11.660 --> 4:16:14.260
 and, you know, when he invented Turing machines, you know,

4:16:14.260 --> 4:16:16.980
 and imagining what computers would end up doing,

4:16:16.980 --> 4:16:17.820
 so to speak.

4:16:17.820 --> 4:16:18.660
 Yeah.

4:16:18.660 --> 4:16:19.500
 You know, and it's...

4:16:19.500 --> 4:16:20.340
 It's very difficult.

4:16:20.340 --> 4:16:21.180
 It's difficult, right.

4:16:21.180 --> 4:16:22.020
 And it's, and I mean, this thing...

4:16:22.020 --> 4:16:23.460
 Made a few reasonable predictions,

4:16:23.460 --> 4:16:25.500
 but most of it, he couldn't predict, possibly.

4:16:25.500 --> 4:16:28.300
 By the time, by 1950, he was making reasonable predictions

4:16:28.300 --> 4:16:29.140
 about some things.

4:16:29.140 --> 4:16:30.140
 But not the 30s, yeah.

4:16:30.140 --> 4:16:34.660
 Right, not when he first, you know, conceptualized,

4:16:34.660 --> 4:16:37.380
 you know, and he conceptualized universal computing

4:16:37.380 --> 4:16:39.180
 for a very specific mathematical reason

4:16:39.180 --> 4:16:41.340
 that wasn't as general.

4:16:41.340 --> 4:16:44.220
 But yes, it's a good sort of exercise in humility

4:16:44.220 --> 4:16:46.860
 to realize that it's kind of like,

4:16:46.860 --> 4:16:49.580
 it's really hard to figure these things out.

4:16:49.580 --> 4:16:52.260
 The engineering of the universe,

4:16:52.260 --> 4:16:55.860
 if we know how the universe works, how can we engineer it?

4:16:55.860 --> 4:16:57.580
 That's such a beautiful vision.

4:16:57.580 --> 4:16:58.420
 That's such a beautiful vision.

4:16:58.420 --> 4:16:59.740
 By the way, I have to mention one more thing,

4:16:59.740 --> 4:17:04.300
 which is the ultimate question from physics is,

4:17:04.300 --> 4:17:07.380
 okay, so we have this abstract model of the universe.

4:17:07.380 --> 4:17:11.260
 Why does the universe exist at all, right?

4:17:11.260 --> 4:17:15.220
 So, you know, we might say there is a formal model

4:17:15.220 --> 4:17:18.100
 that if you run this model, you get the universe,

4:17:18.100 --> 4:17:21.900
 or the model gives you, you know, a model of the universe,

4:17:21.900 --> 4:17:25.300
 right, you run this mathematical thing

4:17:25.300 --> 4:17:27.820
 and the mathematics unfolds in the way

4:17:27.820 --> 4:17:29.420
 that corresponds to the universe.

4:17:29.420 --> 4:17:32.460
 But the question is, why was that actualized?

4:17:32.460 --> 4:17:35.980
 Why does the actual universe actually exist?

4:17:35.980 --> 4:17:39.220
 And so this is another one of these humility

4:17:39.220 --> 4:17:41.700
 and it's like, can you figure this out?

4:17:41.700 --> 4:17:44.780
 I have a guess, okay, about the answer to that.

4:17:44.780 --> 4:17:47.820
 And my guess is somewhat unsatisfying,

4:17:47.820 --> 4:17:50.380
 but my guess is that it's a little bit similar

4:17:50.380 --> 4:17:52.740
 to Gödel's second incompleteness theorem,

4:17:52.740 --> 4:17:55.180
 which is the statement that from within,

4:17:55.180 --> 4:17:58.060
 as an axiomatic theory like piano arithmetic,

4:17:58.060 --> 4:17:59.780
 you cannot from within that theory

4:17:59.780 --> 4:18:02.420
 prove the consistency of the theory.

4:18:02.420 --> 4:18:07.420
 So my guess is that for entities within the universe,

4:18:08.140 --> 4:18:11.540
 there is no finite determination that can be made

4:18:11.540 --> 4:18:15.260
 of the statement the universe exists

4:18:15.260 --> 4:18:18.580
 is essentially undecidable to any entity

4:18:18.580 --> 4:18:19.900
 that is embedded in the universe.

4:18:19.900 --> 4:18:22.780
 Within that universe, how does that make you feel?

4:18:22.780 --> 4:18:27.780
 Does that put you at peace that it's impossible,

4:18:27.980 --> 4:18:30.940
 or is it really ultimately frustrating?

4:18:30.940 --> 4:18:35.460
 Well, I think it just says that it's not a kind of question

4:18:35.460 --> 4:18:40.140
 that, you know, there are things that it is reasonable.

4:18:40.140 --> 4:18:42.780
 I mean, there's kinds of, you know,

4:18:42.780 --> 4:18:44.580
 you can talk about hyper computation as well.

4:18:44.580 --> 4:18:46.500
 You can say, imagine there was a hyper computer,

4:18:46.500 --> 4:18:47.700
 here's what it would do.

4:18:47.700 --> 4:18:49.940
 So okay, great, it would be lovely to have a hyper computer,

4:18:49.940 --> 4:18:52.300
 but unfortunately we can't make it in the universe.

4:18:52.300 --> 4:18:53.540
 Like it would be lovely to answer this,

4:18:53.540 --> 4:18:56.300
 but unfortunately we can't do it in the universe.

4:18:56.300 --> 4:18:59.100
 And you know, this is all we have, so to speak.

4:18:59.100 --> 4:19:02.340
 And I think it's really just a statement.

4:19:02.340 --> 4:19:06.180
 It's sort of, in the end, it'll be a kind of a logical,

4:19:06.180 --> 4:19:08.380
 logically inevitable statement, I think.

4:19:08.380 --> 4:19:10.700
 I think it will be something where it is,

4:19:10.700 --> 4:19:13.260
 as you understand what it means to have,

4:19:13.260 --> 4:19:16.220
 what it means to have a sort of predicate of existence

4:19:16.220 --> 4:19:17.780
 and what it means to have these kinds of things,

4:19:17.780 --> 4:19:20.460
 it will sort of be inevitable that this has to be the case,

4:19:20.460 --> 4:19:23.460
 that from within that universe, you can't establish

4:19:23.460 --> 4:19:25.060
 the reason for its existence, so to speak.

4:19:25.060 --> 4:19:26.900
 You can't prove that it exists and so on.

4:19:26.900 --> 4:19:29.940
 And nevertheless, because of computational reducibility,

4:19:29.940 --> 4:19:34.140
 the future is ultimately not predictable, full of mystery,

4:19:34.140 --> 4:19:36.860
 and that's what makes life worth living.

4:19:36.860 --> 4:19:37.780
 Right, I mean, right.

4:19:37.780 --> 4:19:39.340
 And you know, it's funny for me,

4:19:39.340 --> 4:19:43.100
 because as a pure sort of human being doing what I do,

4:19:43.100 --> 4:19:46.780
 it's, you know, like I'm interested in people,

4:19:46.780 --> 4:19:51.020
 I like sort of the whole human experience, so to speak.

4:19:51.020 --> 4:19:53.980
 And yet, it's a little bit weird when I'm thinking,

4:19:53.980 --> 4:19:56.460
 you know, it's all hypergraphs down there,

4:19:56.460 --> 4:19:57.780
 and it's all just.

4:19:57.780 --> 4:19:59.580
 Hypergraphs all the way down.

4:19:59.580 --> 4:20:00.420
 Right.

4:20:00.420 --> 4:20:01.380
 It's like turtles all the way down.

4:20:01.380 --> 4:20:02.540
 Yeah, yeah, right.

4:20:02.540 --> 4:20:06.580
 And it's kind of, you know, to me, it is a funny thing,

4:20:06.580 --> 4:20:08.220
 because every so often I get this, you know,

4:20:08.220 --> 4:20:10.620
 as I'm thinking about, I think we've really gotten,

4:20:10.620 --> 4:20:12.500
 you know, we've really figured out kind of the essence

4:20:12.500 --> 4:20:14.780
 of how physics works, and I'm like thinking to myself,

4:20:14.780 --> 4:20:16.420
 you know, here's this physical thing,

4:20:16.420 --> 4:20:17.780
 and I'm like, you know,

4:20:17.780 --> 4:20:19.900
 this feels like a very definite thing.

4:20:19.900 --> 4:20:21.460
 How can it be the case that this is just

4:20:21.460 --> 4:20:23.980
 some rule or reference frame of, you know,

4:20:23.980 --> 4:20:28.420
 this infinite creature that is so abstract and so on?

4:20:28.420 --> 4:20:32.980
 And I kind of, it is a, it's a funny sort of feeling

4:20:32.980 --> 4:20:37.620
 that, you know, we are, we're sort of, it's like,

4:20:37.620 --> 4:20:39.580
 in the end, it's just sort of,

4:20:39.580 --> 4:20:42.220
 we're just happy we're just humans type thing.

4:20:42.220 --> 4:20:44.980
 And it's kind of like, but we're making,

4:20:44.980 --> 4:20:49.980
 we make things as, it's not like we're just a tiny speck.

4:20:50.020 --> 4:20:54.500
 We are, in a sense, the, we are more important

4:20:54.500 --> 4:20:58.340
 by virtue of the fact that, in a sense,

4:20:58.340 --> 4:21:02.780
 it's not like there's, there is no ultimate, you know,

4:21:02.780 --> 4:21:05.020
 it's like, we're important because,

4:21:06.540 --> 4:21:08.900
 because, you know, we're here, so to speak,

4:21:08.900 --> 4:21:10.900
 and we're not, it's not like there's a thing

4:21:10.900 --> 4:21:15.780
 where we're saying, you know, we are just but one

4:21:15.780 --> 4:21:18.380
 sort of intelligence out of all these other intelligences.

4:21:18.380 --> 4:21:20.860
 And so, you know, ultimately there'll be

4:21:20.860 --> 4:21:23.980
 the super intelligence, which is all of these put together

4:21:23.980 --> 4:21:25.260
 and they'll be very different from us.

4:21:25.260 --> 4:21:27.540
 No, it's actually going to be equivalent to us.

4:21:27.540 --> 4:21:31.380
 And the thing that makes us a sort of special

4:21:31.380 --> 4:21:34.740
 is just the details of us, so to speak.

4:21:34.740 --> 4:21:36.700
 It's not something where we can say,

4:21:36.700 --> 4:21:38.980
 oh, there's this other thing, you know,

4:21:38.980 --> 4:21:40.900
 just, you think humans are cool,

4:21:40.900 --> 4:21:43.260
 just wait until you've seen this.

4:21:43.260 --> 4:21:45.100
 You know, it's going to be much more impressive.

4:21:45.100 --> 4:21:47.020
 Well, no, it's all going to be

4:21:47.020 --> 4:21:48.900
 kind of computationally equivalent.

4:21:48.900 --> 4:21:51.380
 And the thing that, you know, it's not going to be,

4:21:51.380 --> 4:21:53.980
 oh, this thing is amazingly much more impressive

4:21:53.980 --> 4:21:56.860
 and amazingly much more meaningful, let's say.

4:21:56.860 --> 4:21:58.980
 No, we're it.

4:21:58.980 --> 4:22:01.460
 I mean, that's the...

4:22:01.460 --> 4:22:04.380
 And the symbolism of this particular moment.

4:22:04.380 --> 4:22:07.020
 So this has been one of the,

4:22:07.020 --> 4:22:10.860
 one of the favorite conversations I've ever had, Stephen.

4:22:10.860 --> 4:22:12.700
 It's a huge honor to talk to you,

4:22:12.700 --> 4:22:16.660
 to talk about a topic like this for four plus hours

4:22:16.660 --> 4:22:18.620
 on the fundamental theory of physics.

4:22:18.620 --> 4:22:22.900
 And yet we're just two finite descendants of apes

4:22:22.900 --> 4:22:24.940
 that have to end this conversation

4:22:24.940 --> 4:22:28.020
 because darkness have come upon us.

4:22:28.020 --> 4:22:29.980
 Right, and we're going to get bitten by mosquitoes

4:22:29.980 --> 4:22:30.820
 and all kinds of terrible things.

4:22:30.820 --> 4:22:32.540
 The symbolism of that,

4:22:32.540 --> 4:22:36.220
 we're talking about the most basic fabric of reality

4:22:36.220 --> 4:22:39.980
 and having to end because of the fact that things end.

4:22:40.900 --> 4:22:42.580
 It's tragic and beautiful, Stephen.

4:22:42.580 --> 4:22:43.420
 Thank you so much.

4:22:43.420 --> 4:22:44.380
 Huge honor.

4:22:44.380 --> 4:22:47.100
 I can't wait to see what you do in the next couple of days

4:22:47.100 --> 4:22:48.580
 and next week, a month.

4:22:48.580 --> 4:22:50.700
 We're all watching with excitement.

4:22:50.700 --> 4:22:51.540
 Thank you so much.

4:22:51.540 --> 4:22:53.020
 Thanks.

4:22:53.020 --> 4:22:54.500
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

4:22:54.500 --> 4:22:55.660
