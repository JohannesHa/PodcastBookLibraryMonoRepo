00:00.000 --> 00:05.240
 The following is a conversation with George St. Pierre, considered by many to be the greatest

00:05.240 --> 00:11.260
 fighter in the history of UFC and MMA, but even more than that, one of the greatest martial

00:11.260 --> 00:13.520
 artists ever.

00:13.520 --> 00:21.840
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Allform, ExpressVPN, Blinkist, Theragun, and The Information.

00:21.840 --> 00:25.080
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:25.080 --> 00:30.040
 As a side note, let me say that getting the chance to hang out with George, talk to him

00:30.040 --> 00:36.140
 on the podcast, record a quick self defense video that I'll release soon, all while

00:36.140 --> 00:41.540
 both of us wearing suits was one of the most memorable days of my life.

00:41.540 --> 00:45.640
 In setting all this up, I talked to Joe Rogan and originally we couldn't schedule a chat

00:45.640 --> 00:51.920
 with him and George on the JRE, which allowed me to pretend for a brief time that George

00:51.920 --> 00:54.960
 came down to Austin just to see me.

00:54.960 --> 00:57.080
 Who the hell am I?

00:57.080 --> 01:01.800
 In truth, him and Joe probably conspired to make me feel special, but that's the point.

01:01.800 --> 01:07.060
 It's inspiring to see George and Joe, who are at the top of their field, treat others

01:07.060 --> 01:13.760
 as equals, as human beings, no matter who they are, even silly Russians in a suit.

01:13.760 --> 01:17.920
 Meeting George was an honor for me beyond words.

01:17.920 --> 01:23.920
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast and here's my conversation with my longtime martial arts

01:23.920 --> 01:29.680
 hero and now my friend, Mr. George St. Pierre.

01:29.680 --> 01:36.640
 In your fighting career, were you more motivated by the love of winning or the fear and hatred

01:36.640 --> 01:37.800
 of losing?

01:37.800 --> 01:44.840
 I like to win better than I hate to lose because if it would not have been the case, I would

01:44.840 --> 01:50.040
 never have fought in the first place because I don't like to fight at all.

01:50.040 --> 01:55.380
 But you talked about the anxiety, the fear that you experienced leading up to a fight.

01:55.380 --> 02:03.180
 So to you, ultimately the reason to go through that difficult process is because it feels

02:03.180 --> 02:06.640
 damn good to have your hand raised?

02:06.640 --> 02:08.040
 There is that.

02:08.040 --> 02:15.080
 There is also the fact that martial art, I've been introduced when I was very young and

02:15.080 --> 02:21.440
 it's probably the best thing I can do in my life, fighting, that's what I do best.

02:21.440 --> 02:32.900
 Also, it provides me of freedom, of access of things that most of people do not have,

02:32.900 --> 02:38.160
 but all that as a price and a lot of money, I made a lot of money, of course, with it.

02:38.160 --> 02:43.120
 I was maybe predisposed with certain abilities.

02:43.120 --> 02:48.160
 I met incredible mentors throughout my life.

02:48.160 --> 02:53.320
 I worked really hard and of course, I had a lot of chances.

02:53.320 --> 03:03.380
 The stars were all aligned and in order to keep that those advantages of freedom, money

03:03.380 --> 03:09.280
 and glory and access of things that most people don't have and have these dream life that

03:09.280 --> 03:16.440
 I have, I had to sacrifice myself and fight in order to keep it.

03:16.440 --> 03:23.280
 It's very hard to understand because I also believe most fighters are not like me.

03:23.280 --> 03:29.000
 A lot of guys, because I corner a lot of guys and it seems to me that they love their job.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.800
 They enjoyed to go fight in the cage.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.000
 I love to train.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.640
 I love the science of fighting, the sport, to be in good shape, the confidence that training

03:40.640 --> 03:43.000
 and mixed martial art give me.

03:43.000 --> 03:51.560
 However, I do not like the feeling of uncertainty, the stress that I have, not knowing if I will

03:51.560 --> 03:59.680
 be badly injured or humiliated or winning the fight.

03:59.680 --> 04:04.440
 To me, I'm bearable and that's what takes the most out of me.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.580
 More than brain damage, more than anything.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.960
 That's what takes the most out of me.

04:08.960 --> 04:15.980
 But the thing you get from it is the freedom that you get because of the money, but because

04:15.980 --> 04:18.520
 of the celebrity, because of everything that comes with it.

04:18.520 --> 04:21.780
 So you can be the best version of yourself because of fighting.

04:21.780 --> 04:27.180
 But at the same time, you've said that, quote, I don't believe there's pleasure in life.

04:27.180 --> 04:30.000
 I believe there's only a relief from pain.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.280
 We have to suffer to be on top.

04:32.280 --> 04:35.720
 So isn't there something to just the suffering in itself?

04:35.720 --> 04:39.840
 Just doing really difficult shit just to get to the top?

04:39.840 --> 04:45.280
 To explain that and so people can relate to it because not everybody's a fighter.

04:45.280 --> 04:53.500
 I think the best example I can give is let's say you're, you haven't eat for a long time

04:53.500 --> 04:56.120
 and you're craving, right?

04:56.120 --> 04:58.520
 So you're suffering.

04:58.520 --> 05:04.200
 And then when it's time to eat, finally, you're about to eat your favorite dish.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.760
 It's going to taste so much better.

05:06.760 --> 05:12.620
 So that's why I believe there is always some sort of sacrifice before the pleasure.

05:12.620 --> 05:19.400
 And the more sacrifice you do, like they say in fighting, the bigger the risk, the bigger

05:19.400 --> 05:20.400
 is the reward.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.480
 And I feel that's how it is for me.

05:23.480 --> 05:29.080
 Yeah, I feel that with, I started fasting a little bit in the past couple of years.

05:29.080 --> 05:35.780
 And there's nothing as amazing as a delicious meal or anything, actually anything, any food

05:35.780 --> 05:39.060
 when you haven't eaten for several days.

05:39.060 --> 05:41.560
 It's kind of incredible.

05:41.560 --> 05:45.840
 It's not incredible in this simple way of finally I get to eat.

05:45.840 --> 05:51.760
 You get to truly experience the beauty of what it is to be alive.

05:51.760 --> 05:58.120
 Like that little piece of food, you see all the flavors, you feel just the experience

05:58.120 --> 06:04.400
 of it is ultimately of gratitude of how awesome it is to be alive.

06:04.400 --> 06:08.880
 But when you eat many times a day and you're pigging out and you don't get to experience

06:08.880 --> 06:09.880
 that.

06:09.880 --> 06:10.880
 And it's fascinating.

06:10.880 --> 06:16.680
 It's really like fasting is one of the most accessible things for people, I think to experience

06:16.680 --> 06:21.400
 that kind of pairing of hardship to pleasure.

06:21.400 --> 06:22.400
 I agree.

06:22.400 --> 06:26.240
 And in my case, it changed my life on a good way.

06:26.240 --> 06:30.220
 I cannot recommend it to people because everybody is different.

06:30.220 --> 06:39.160
 But to fight Michael Bisping, my last fight was against the champion in the heavier weight

06:39.160 --> 06:41.400
 class that I used to compete at.

06:41.400 --> 06:48.840
 So I thought that if I would gain weight, it would increase my performance.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.400
 And I struggled a lot to gain weight.

06:50.400 --> 06:54.280
 I gained about eight to 10 pounds.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.480
 Normally I walk around 185 pounds.

06:56.480 --> 06:59.440
 And for that fight, I was walking around 195.

06:59.440 --> 07:04.120
 However, I forced myself to eat like six times a day.

07:04.120 --> 07:13.840
 I was on a very strict diet and it didn't feel right to me because I feel like I was

07:13.840 --> 07:18.360
 carrying like a little bit like I was carrying a bag on my shoulder.

07:18.360 --> 07:29.040
 And I think it was a bad idea for me because when I did the weigh in and I went on a scale

07:29.040 --> 07:35.960
 at 185, I couldn't go back to my initial weight that was 195 that I worked so hard for several

07:35.960 --> 07:38.680
 months to get there.

07:38.680 --> 07:42.100
 So I was 190 pounds, but I couldn't get back.

07:42.100 --> 07:46.640
 And the morning of the fight, I got sick.

07:46.640 --> 07:53.440
 We didn't know what it was in the beginning because in order to know, to find out what

07:53.440 --> 07:55.560
 it was, I needed to do what they call a colonoscopy.

07:55.560 --> 08:02.840
 They put a camera inside of you and to do that, they give you something that makes that

08:02.840 --> 08:03.840
 empty you.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.980
 And I was trying to gain weight, not to lose weight.

08:06.980 --> 08:12.600
 So I told myself I'm going to wait after the fight, whatever it is, because it was pretty

08:12.600 --> 08:13.600
 bad.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.600
 It was blood.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.600
 And I didn't know what I was.

08:15.600 --> 08:16.760
 I was very concerned.

08:16.760 --> 08:17.760
 I thought I had maybe cancer.

08:17.760 --> 08:20.240
 I was freaking out.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.720
 So I said, I'm going to do that fight.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.120
 And then after right away, I'm going to make a checkup.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.440
 So I did the fight.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.440
 Everything went well.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.440
 I won the fight.

08:28.440 --> 08:29.440
 I went back home.

08:29.440 --> 08:33.640
 I did a colonoscopy and I got diagnosed with ulcer colitis.

08:33.640 --> 08:37.800
 Then I got on very severe medication to get better.

08:37.800 --> 08:39.960
 And I'm not a big fan of medication.

08:39.960 --> 08:46.040
 I was trying to look for more natural way to get better.

08:46.040 --> 08:50.920
 And I found out about fasting and it really changed my life.

08:50.920 --> 08:59.160
 I met Dr. Jason Fong, who was one of the world authority of fasting.

08:59.160 --> 09:07.320
 He treat diabetes patient with fasting and he gave me a program of fasting and it really

09:07.320 --> 09:08.320
 changed my life.

09:08.320 --> 09:15.160
 And right away what I did is I went in a CAT scan to see the difference because it was

09:15.160 --> 09:19.240
 right after my fight with Michael Bisping and I did the CAT scan.

09:19.240 --> 09:26.000
 So I had my muscle mass, bone density, fat percentage, water retention.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
 It's pretty amazing.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.800
 It can show you which harm has more muscle than the other.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.080
 It's very precise.

09:32.080 --> 09:35.520
 And I did it like two months after.

09:35.520 --> 09:40.800
 So I started doing time restricted eating, 16 eight.

09:40.800 --> 09:46.200
 But right away when I started, I did three days water fast.

09:46.200 --> 09:52.240
 And the Dr. Jason Fong, he said, because I like to train during those days, I consume

09:52.240 --> 09:57.040
 Himalayan salt to make sure, because when you sweat, there's a lot of minerals to make

09:57.040 --> 10:00.200
 sure you don't deplete your mineral.

10:00.200 --> 10:06.200
 And when I compared the two results in the CAT scan, I found out my biggest concern was

10:06.200 --> 10:07.680
 to lose muscle mass.

10:07.680 --> 10:11.080
 I found out that I did not lose muscle mass.

10:11.080 --> 10:14.060
 Instead of losing it, it increased a little bit.

10:14.060 --> 10:21.480
 Even though my weight on the scale was lighter, I kept the same muscle mass even increases

10:21.480 --> 10:22.480
 a little bit.

10:22.480 --> 10:25.720
 My bone density increases a little bit.

10:25.720 --> 10:30.200
 My water retention is the biggest thing that decrease.

10:30.200 --> 10:33.640
 So my inflammation and my fat percentage.

10:33.640 --> 10:41.240
 So basically by looking at the data, I found out that by eating so much, trying to gain

10:41.240 --> 10:47.480
 weight to fight Michael Bisping, it only increases my water retention, which is not good because

10:47.480 --> 10:50.840
 it's like dead weight and inflammation on you.

10:50.840 --> 10:54.480
 So what was the actual process of fasting?

10:54.480 --> 10:59.760
 You said 16, eight time restricted, so intermittent fasting.

10:59.760 --> 11:03.800
 But you also mentioned the three hour, the three day water fast.

11:03.800 --> 11:04.800
 What did that feel like?

11:04.800 --> 11:07.480
 And you also said training during the three day?

11:07.480 --> 11:08.480
 Yes.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.480
 How did that feel?

11:09.480 --> 11:12.400
 Can you give me some details of, this is fascinating.

11:12.400 --> 11:17.720
 So I do three days water fast, four times a year.

11:17.720 --> 11:18.720
 Nice.

11:18.720 --> 11:24.440
 For me, I do it, everybody is different, but for me, I do it after New Year's.

11:24.440 --> 11:29.240
 Because during the holidays, that's when I eat bad foods and I drink.

11:29.240 --> 11:34.400
 I see it more like a cleansing, like a detox, so to speak.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.760
 Mental too, like psychological.

11:35.760 --> 11:36.760
 Yes.

11:36.760 --> 11:43.400
 I do it after the New Year's, right before the summer, cut for the beach.

11:43.400 --> 11:47.600
 After the summer, because of the summer, I've been partying a little bit sometimes, let

11:47.600 --> 11:48.600
 myself go.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.800
 And right before the holidays.

11:51.800 --> 11:57.680
 And I've tried, Dr. Phuong, he says to me, said, George, everybody's different because

11:57.680 --> 12:01.200
 I'm a very active person and everybody has a different genetics.

12:01.200 --> 12:08.400
 So for me, I feel that three days is the sweet spot because I still train during those three

12:08.400 --> 12:09.400
 days.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.800
 The first day, the first two days, I don't change nothing.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.640
 I train on my regular schedule.

12:14.640 --> 12:19.200
 However, on the third day, I modify a little bit.

12:19.200 --> 12:25.800
 I do something more easy and that's how I do it.

12:25.800 --> 12:31.800
 And I've tried before, because when I say three days is my sweet spot, I've tried to

12:31.800 --> 12:33.680
 go up to five days.

12:33.680 --> 12:39.080
 But the problem is after my third days, I found out that I had a big problem sleeping.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.760
 I get into a hyperactive mode.

12:41.760 --> 12:48.600
 They call that the hunter gatherer mode, you know, like your brain, I mean, it's amazing.

12:48.600 --> 12:53.280
 Your creativity is at its peak, but you cannot sleep very well.

12:53.280 --> 12:56.220
 And sleeping for me, I think it's very important.

12:56.220 --> 12:57.920
 So that's why I do three days for me.

12:57.920 --> 12:58.920
 It's my sweet spot.

12:58.920 --> 12:59.920
 That's interesting.

12:59.920 --> 13:00.920
 You're right.

13:00.920 --> 13:04.760
 It's the four or five days when you start, see sleep is not important for me.

13:04.760 --> 13:07.520
 So the creativity is really important.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.600
 So it's very interesting the places your mind goes after a few days.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.600
 You're right.

13:12.600 --> 13:16.800
 But I mean, what does it do to your mind?

13:16.800 --> 13:18.860
 So you mentioned your body likes it.

13:18.860 --> 13:23.760
 In terms of training, do you find that it helps you focus and think?

13:23.760 --> 13:28.480
 I mean, you're one of the great strategic thinkers in terms of martial arts.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.000
 Does it help with learning?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.160
 Does it help with thinking?

13:31.160 --> 13:34.160
 Does it help with strategizing and all of that?

13:34.160 --> 13:39.240
 Well, unfortunately, I got into fasting after I retired.

13:39.240 --> 13:45.760
 I really wish people asked me, would you have done it during the time that you competed?

13:45.760 --> 13:48.240
 And the answer is yes.

13:48.240 --> 13:52.400
 I think we live in a society that we're bombarded by publicity.

13:52.400 --> 13:56.000
 Oh, buy this, eat protein, this, that.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.280
 And fasting, nobody makes money with it because there's nothing to sell.

14:02.280 --> 14:06.380
 I think that's why a lot of people have not heard about it.

14:06.380 --> 14:13.480
 And even for myself, if someone would have talked to me about the benefits of fasting

14:13.480 --> 14:23.840
 when I was training before I got sick, I would probably have ignored him because it's hard

14:23.840 --> 14:24.840
 to believe.

14:24.840 --> 14:25.840
 It sounds ridiculous.

14:25.840 --> 14:26.840
 Don't eat.

14:26.840 --> 14:27.840
 Yes.

14:27.840 --> 14:30.800
 It's going to help your mind and you're going to gain muscle potentially.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.800
 Exactly.

14:31.800 --> 14:37.280
 And perhaps people have talked to me about it, but it went in one of my ears and got

14:37.280 --> 14:39.760
 out from the other side, you know?

14:39.760 --> 14:42.280
 But it really changed my life.

14:42.280 --> 14:49.720
 And I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and it helps me get rid of all my symptoms.

14:49.720 --> 14:55.440
 What I do is, I know a lot of people have ulcerative colitis and for me, I cannot recommend

14:55.440 --> 14:58.500
 it to other people because everybody is different.

14:58.500 --> 15:05.680
 But for me, I made a lot of research of how people from ulcerative colitis got better.

15:05.680 --> 15:10.840
 And I found out that a lot of people that got that condition get better in the natural

15:10.840 --> 15:17.920
 way through fasting, eating fermented food, collagen and bone broth and stuff like that.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.000
 And it made a huge difference in my life.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.480
 I just wish I would have known that before.

15:22.480 --> 15:26.000
 So do you have a specific diet wise stuff you like?

15:26.000 --> 15:32.240
 So I've recently, another ridiculous sounding thing, but it makes me feel really good is

15:32.240 --> 15:33.640
 very low carbs.

15:33.640 --> 15:37.660
 So keto, even carnivore, it sounds ridiculous.

15:37.660 --> 15:39.360
 It doesn't make any sense.

15:39.360 --> 15:42.440
 But it makes me feel really good, even for performance.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.280
 Is Rogan has influenced you?

15:44.280 --> 15:45.780
 He's a carnivore diet.

15:45.780 --> 15:49.680
 I was influenced actually by people, yeah.

15:49.680 --> 15:54.400
 There's I'll tell you where, because I was doing it before he was doing it.

15:54.400 --> 16:00.560
 It was popular in the endurance athlete community where it was fat adapted athletes, people

16:00.560 --> 16:07.000
 who insane people who run 50 miles, 100 miles, they figured out that they could fuel their

16:07.000 --> 16:13.080
 body by with fat that can go to fat as the source of energy as opposed to carbs.

16:13.080 --> 16:20.400
 So I remember hoping that I'll be able to learn how to run 50 miles and so on.

16:20.400 --> 16:29.560
 I've never done more than 22, but it, I just remember switching away from carbs and feeling

16:29.560 --> 16:30.560
 really liberated.

16:30.560 --> 16:33.980
 Like I wasn't thinking about food as much.

16:33.980 --> 16:37.560
 I'm able to eat once a day and feel really good.

16:37.560 --> 16:44.760
 I mean, I think every everybody's body is different, but I think carbs make me lazy.

16:44.760 --> 16:51.720
 Maybe it's because the crash, yeah, it's the crash, but also just psychologically something

16:51.720 --> 16:54.560
 it it forces me to also think about food too much.

16:54.560 --> 16:59.480
 Like it starts becoming, you know, our logistic, you said our society is so much about food.

16:59.480 --> 17:03.620
 There's so many ads, so much advertisement and so much of our social life is about food.

17:03.620 --> 17:10.800
 And so it's very easy to live life, like live day to day thinking, when is the next meal?

17:10.800 --> 17:11.800
 Like what am I going to eat for lunch?

17:11.800 --> 17:12.800
 What am I going to eat for dinner?

17:12.800 --> 17:14.960
 What am I going to eat for breakfast?

17:14.960 --> 17:21.120
 And if you're not careful, that's going to get in the way of you doing cool shit for

17:21.120 --> 17:25.440
 like liberating yourself and thinking like, what am I actually passionate about in this

17:25.440 --> 17:26.440
 life?

17:26.440 --> 17:30.760
 Like creating and forgetting to eat those kinds of things and still being able to fuel

17:30.760 --> 17:31.760
 your body.

17:31.760 --> 17:32.760
 I don't know.

17:32.760 --> 17:39.520
 It's been fascinating to, to figure out like later in life that carbs aren't necessary

17:39.520 --> 17:40.520
 to function.

17:40.520 --> 17:44.120
 Well, it makes me think like, we don't know anything about nutrition.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.120
 That's right.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.120
 Yes.

17:46.120 --> 17:53.040
 You know, personally, I don't think I could have a diet without carbs.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.920
 I love chocolate too much.

17:54.920 --> 17:57.160
 For me eating, it's a, it's a pleasure of life.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.160
 I love my carbs.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.520
 I love my sugar.

17:59.520 --> 18:06.480
 However, if you talk about that, I don't have a specific diet, but recently I, what I'm

18:06.480 --> 18:13.520
 trying to do is the days that I do not work out, I only eat once.

18:13.520 --> 18:14.760
 That's kind of my rules.

18:14.760 --> 18:22.880
 Plus I try to respect 16 eight and do my three day fast, uh, uh, four times a year.

18:22.880 --> 18:28.900
 But the rest of the thing, I, I, I, I let myself loose because I, I don't think I would

18:28.900 --> 18:35.640
 be happy if I, if I, uh, if I, if I don't give myself the, the, the, the right to, to

18:35.640 --> 18:38.920
 eat for me personally, I love to eat so much next.

18:38.920 --> 18:45.640
 And you talk about a diet, carnivore diet is very interesting because I, um, a few years

18:45.640 --> 18:53.280
 ago I went to Africa in, uh, Masai Mara and, uh, it's a tribe in, uh, in, in, uh, East

18:53.280 --> 18:56.920
 Africa and, um, I want to visit them.

18:56.920 --> 19:05.520
 I did a safari and I talked to them and these guys, they, their diet is 99% carnivore.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.120
 They they, that's crazy.

19:07.120 --> 19:10.840
 And you should see they're very beautiful people shredded.

19:10.840 --> 19:12.200
 Some people would say, Oh, it's genetic.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.480
 I'm like, yeah, maybe it's genetic.

19:13.480 --> 19:21.040
 But I mean, think about the Eskimos also that like most of their diet is on, on fish, right?

19:21.040 --> 19:26.200
 They, they, so I believe it can be done, you know, like, I believe it can be done and like

19:26.200 --> 19:28.040
 an exclusive carnivore diet.

19:28.040 --> 19:33.560
 And I, I think I'm going to try it pretty soon just to have the experience, you know,

19:33.560 --> 19:34.560
 to see how it feels like.

19:34.560 --> 19:39.040
 Well, you're going to hang out with Joe, uh, be careful bringing it up because he'll convince

19:39.040 --> 19:41.120
 you to, uh, forever switch to carnivore.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.120
 Definitely.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.120
 He loves it.

19:43.120 --> 19:47.260
 I mean, but just like you, I think he loves food.

19:47.260 --> 19:50.160
 So he's, he can't ever stay on carnivore.

19:50.160 --> 19:55.360
 It was funny cause we went to an Italian restaurant together and I still only eat meat.

19:55.360 --> 20:00.880
 Like I love, um, I love the constraints of discipline.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.440
 That's, that's partially why I like carnivore.

20:03.440 --> 20:09.120
 I like saying no to food that is delicious.

20:09.120 --> 20:12.800
 But a part of the problem is that I don't know how to moderate.

20:12.800 --> 20:13.800
 You said chocolate.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.080
 I don't know how to have one chocolate.

20:15.080 --> 20:17.560
 Is that something you're able to do?

20:17.560 --> 20:19.520
 Have like in moderation?

20:19.520 --> 20:22.600
 No, it's when it, when I have an opportunity, I do it.

20:22.600 --> 20:29.520
 I don't have any, I'm an extremist person, uh, Lex, I, I, that's the thing I, when I,

20:29.520 --> 20:33.280
 when I have a chance, I, I like, I, I just eat, I go too much.

20:33.280 --> 20:37.240
 And that's why I like about my life, you know, that's what I like about fasting.

20:37.240 --> 20:42.620
 Because probably if I would not have discovered fasting, eating chocolate would give me cramps

20:42.620 --> 20:48.400
 and all sorts of problems because people on ulcer colitis, normally they cannot eat chocolate.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.660
 They cannot drink alcohol.

20:49.660 --> 20:57.400
 But I believe because I'm fasting, that's the reason why I'm medication, medicine, medication

20:57.400 --> 20:58.400
 free.

20:58.400 --> 21:02.880
 I can eat whatever I want, whenever I want, but I have to do that, that fasting, you know,

21:02.880 --> 21:07.440
 and now it becomes to a, it became to a point that it's no longer hard for me.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.440
 It's like normal.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.440
 I don't even force myself.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.160
 I don't, it's easy.

21:12.160 --> 21:13.160
 You know what I mean?

21:13.160 --> 21:17.760
 Some of my friends thinks I'm, think I'm, I'm insane, you know, but I tell them it's

21:17.760 --> 21:21.520
 like with, when you get used to it, it becomes like an habit.

21:21.520 --> 21:26.920
 And, and I'm, and I know that hunter gatherer, like our ancestor did not eat three times

21:26.920 --> 21:27.920
 a day.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.160
 It's, it's, it's not true.

21:30.160 --> 21:35.840
 They, they ate one day they could, and when they eat, they, they, they, they feed themselves

21:35.840 --> 21:39.800
 as much as they can until that, because the next time, because they didn't know when they,

21:39.800 --> 21:40.800
 they could eat again.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.800
 Right.

21:41.800 --> 21:47.760
 So it's, I think that's how we're, we're, we're built, you know, to, to, to have this

21:47.760 --> 21:50.800
 similar lifestyle.

21:50.800 --> 21:54.680
 If we could take a step back to the discussion about fear a little bit.

21:54.680 --> 22:00.160
 So Mike Tyson talks about this process of him walking to the ring.

22:00.160 --> 22:05.600
 He sounds similar to you in many ways of the anxiety and the fear that he experiences.

22:05.600 --> 22:12.600
 And he has this sort of story that he tells about walking to the ring and being supremely

22:12.600 --> 22:14.140
 afraid.

22:14.140 --> 22:19.120
 But as he walks and gets closer and steps in, he finds the confidence and becomes supremely

22:19.120 --> 22:20.120
 confident.

22:20.120 --> 22:21.120
 I think he calls himself like a God.

22:21.120 --> 22:24.120
 I feel like a God in the ring.

22:24.120 --> 22:28.480
 Is, is, do you go through a similar process of finding the confidence?

22:28.480 --> 22:31.840
 Well, it, yes.

22:31.840 --> 22:38.040
 And I use, I use a James Lange theory that they did.

22:38.040 --> 22:44.800
 So what I do is because I'm, I'm, I'm not afraid to admit that I'm afraid.

22:44.800 --> 22:51.720
 And in the beginning of my career, I really thought I asked myself, because I was very

22:51.720 --> 22:57.880
 good in mixed martial, but I, I really thought I wasn't made for this because the idea of

22:57.880 --> 23:03.360
 fighting didn't, was, was, didn't make me happy.

23:03.360 --> 23:09.140
 It's something like I, I was, I was forced to do in order to keep that lifestyle that

23:09.140 --> 23:12.080
 I have and achieve my goal.

23:12.080 --> 23:17.080
 Perhaps one day to make enough money to retire and you know, that, that was my dream.

23:17.080 --> 23:22.200
 But when I was looking around the gym where I was training, most of my training partner,

23:22.200 --> 23:23.200
 they were happy.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.200
 They were excited.

23:24.200 --> 23:27.480
 And sometime I corner, I corner a lot of guys and they're happy and they're in the locker

23:27.480 --> 23:28.480
 room.

23:28.480 --> 23:30.800
 They don't react the same way I do.

23:30.800 --> 23:37.760
 Some perhaps does, but if you see me in the locker room, like when I get like my last

23:37.760 --> 23:42.600
 fight with Michael Bisping, just to give you an example in my last fight with Michael Bisping,

23:42.600 --> 23:46.760
 because it's fresh, it's the one that is the most recent and, but it's always the same

23:46.760 --> 23:47.760
 thing.

23:47.760 --> 23:55.080
 My last fight in Bisping, I get in the locker room, I like three guys that I train with,

23:55.080 --> 23:59.600
 Mickey Gall, Eamon Zahabi and Joseph Duffy.

23:59.600 --> 24:00.600
 They all lost.

24:00.600 --> 24:05.200
 It was like, like my, my locker room was basically cursed.

24:05.200 --> 24:10.280
 You know, when you're in a locker room and people from your locker room leave for a fight

24:10.280 --> 24:14.280
 and then they come back, it's kind of a momentum, you know, you, you, you shake and yeah, good

24:14.280 --> 24:15.280
 job.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.280
 Now it's my turn.

24:16.280 --> 24:19.640
 You know, it's kind of a team brotherhood sort of thing.

24:19.640 --> 24:26.840
 So the, the, the, the atmosphere in my locker room was pretty bad.

24:26.840 --> 24:32.400
 It was like going to a, you know, like a funeral.

24:32.400 --> 24:39.880
 So I was very scared and before every fight, I asked myself, I asked myself always, shit,

24:39.880 --> 24:41.320
 what the hell I'm doing here?

24:41.320 --> 24:43.040
 Why did I choose to come back?

24:43.040 --> 24:44.040
 Oh my God.

24:44.040 --> 24:46.440
 And I'm freaking out.

24:46.440 --> 24:53.400
 However, I'm putting on a mask like I'm acting because if I don't do that, it will reflect

24:53.400 --> 24:54.720
 on my coaches.

24:54.720 --> 24:59.880
 And if my coach, my, my, the confidence of my coaches is affected, it will reflect, reflect

24:59.880 --> 25:00.880
 on me.

25:00.880 --> 25:02.440
 So I need to feel strong.

25:02.440 --> 25:09.000
 I need to make them believe that I'm excited to be there and I'm happy to be there.

25:09.000 --> 25:15.560
 So this sort of play start when I get, when I first step in the locker room, even though

25:15.560 --> 25:20.400
 I feel completely different, but that's how I play it.

25:20.400 --> 25:24.120
 Normally the day, the fight day, I never fell, feel a hundred percent.

25:24.120 --> 25:27.640
 I always feel exhausted, tired.

25:27.640 --> 25:32.360
 My highs are hitching because I don't sleep enough the few nights before, because I'm

25:32.360 --> 25:37.600
 constantly rehearse, rehearsing scenarios that might happen in the fight.

25:37.600 --> 25:43.960
 So mentally it's not that I'm not on top, but you keep all that to yourself.

25:43.960 --> 25:48.720
 I keep it to myself and I'm lying to everybody around me.

25:48.720 --> 25:54.680
 But everybody knows, you know, fair ass John De Niro, they know Freddie Rose, they've

25:54.680 --> 25:58.120
 been with me for a long time, so they know what's going on, but at least I'm lying to

25:58.120 --> 25:59.120
 them.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.120
 I'm like, I'm feeling great.

26:00.120 --> 26:05.680
 So, and seeing all my training partner, like very disappointed because they lost our fight.

26:05.680 --> 26:08.800
 Some were badly hurt as well.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.480
 It was hard.

26:10.480 --> 26:15.120
 So I remember I started to warm up and everything.

26:15.120 --> 26:22.660
 And as you start to warm up, you become a different person because we know that certain

26:22.660 --> 26:27.000
 posture and yoga can affect your mental state.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.960
 But I would say it's a little bit the same thing in fighting, you know, like when you

26:30.960 --> 26:37.360
 started hitting the pads, your muscle memory, your instincts comes back and you remember

26:37.360 --> 26:42.000
 that you're good at this, you know, and your confidence start to grow.

26:42.000 --> 26:47.300
 And as seeing your trainers holding the pad and repeating your moves, it makes you also

26:47.300 --> 26:53.000
 remember all the sacrifice you have done through your training camp and confidence come from

26:53.000 --> 26:55.200
 how you prepared yourself.

26:55.200 --> 26:59.860
 And even you're afraid, you can be confident in the same time.

26:59.860 --> 27:03.360
 Being afraid and being confident is two different things.

27:03.360 --> 27:11.440
 And before every fight, just right before I walk in, when I'm scared, I go in the bathroom

27:11.440 --> 27:12.680
 and I look at myself in the mirror.

27:12.680 --> 27:18.360
 I used to have a bandana and a gi, but now I didn't have this for my last fight because

27:18.360 --> 27:22.240
 of the new Reebok deal they had.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.200
 But I did the same rehearsal that I always do.

27:24.200 --> 27:28.120
 I look at myself in the mirror and I start to compliment myself.

27:28.120 --> 27:32.760
 Like even if I don't believe it, I'm starting to trying to believe it as I am.

27:32.760 --> 27:36.240
 I'm finding all the reasons why I'm going to win the fight.

27:36.240 --> 27:41.440
 And all my trainer knows that before every fight, when the guy from the UFC goes and

27:41.440 --> 27:46.160
 Steppen Maroon says, St. Pierre, you're up next, I always take a few minutes to do that

27:46.160 --> 27:47.800
 same rehearsal.

27:47.800 --> 27:52.320
 And I tell myself I'm going to win this fight because I'm better and I'm very cocky about

27:52.320 --> 27:53.320
 myself.

27:53.320 --> 27:55.920
 I'm telling all the reasons that I'm going to win.

27:55.920 --> 27:56.920
 I got a better team.

27:56.920 --> 28:01.800
 I made more sacrifice, you know, I'm faster, I'm more powerful, way more athletic.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.440
 My fighting IQ is better than him.

28:03.440 --> 28:08.440
 I got a strategy on point that he's never going to be able to keep up with and this

28:08.440 --> 28:09.600
 and that.

28:09.600 --> 28:14.800
 And I was telling myself, I'm going to show these young kids how things should be done.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.960
 You know, I'm trying to boost myself.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.800
 Try to boost yourself and you start to believe in it.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.600
 You become a different person.

28:21.600 --> 28:28.320
 So when you walk out the bathroom, now rock and roll, now I really believe it for real.

28:28.320 --> 28:31.420
 You know, like I'm still scared, but I believe it for real.

28:31.420 --> 28:33.900
 And that's the transformation that happened for me right there.

28:33.900 --> 28:39.160
 And from that from now, from from there to the fight, it's until the fight is over.

28:39.160 --> 28:44.400
 It's called I call it cruise control because you don't have time to think in a fight.

28:44.400 --> 28:47.080
 If you're trying to think, you're missing the opportunity.

28:47.080 --> 28:49.760
 So that's how I see it for myself.

28:49.760 --> 28:53.560
 So at that point, you stop thinking and you just go cruise control, autopilot.

28:53.560 --> 28:59.040
 Trust yourself, you know, trust yourself because you repeated all the scenarios, you know.

28:59.040 --> 29:02.400
 So everything that you have done, it's inside your computer.

29:02.400 --> 29:07.720
 Your computer, your brain is programmed to react accordingly to certain situations.

29:07.720 --> 29:12.480
 And it's not the night of the fight that you will tell yourself, oh, finally, I'm going

29:12.480 --> 29:13.480
 to do this.

29:13.480 --> 29:14.480
 If you do this now.

29:14.480 --> 29:18.160
 No, if you have not practiced it before, you're screwed.

29:18.160 --> 29:22.600
 The preparation, the repetition that makes it happen, you know.

29:22.600 --> 29:31.440
 What about like the really difficult moments in a fight where you are tested to your limits,

29:31.440 --> 29:32.440
 essentially?

29:32.440 --> 29:34.440
 Usually it's cardio related exhaustion, right?

29:34.440 --> 29:39.680
 Where you have to ask yourself that same question is like, why the hell am I doing this?

29:39.680 --> 29:44.160
 Do you experience those or are you able to ride through the autopilot?

29:44.160 --> 29:47.040
 And if you do, like, what do you do in those moments?

29:47.040 --> 29:48.040
 Never in a fight.

29:48.040 --> 29:56.560
 In a fight when the fight is on, I never change my mind, I go until the end.

29:56.560 --> 30:03.200
 However, for example, my first fight with BJ Penn, I had a terrible first round.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.280
 So I had to switch gear.

30:05.280 --> 30:08.400
 That happened sometimes, but it's part of my plan.

30:08.400 --> 30:13.800
 I always have a plan B, plan A, plan B, plan C. You need to have that.

30:13.800 --> 30:18.160
 If fighters go into a fight thinking, oh, I'm going to do this, this, this, and they

30:18.160 --> 30:22.960
 don't have a plan B, if this doesn't work, that means they're not well prepared.

30:22.960 --> 30:29.080
 If you talk to me before every fight, I can, like in 30 seconds, give you my old strategy.

30:29.080 --> 30:33.800
 You know, for BJ Penn, my first fight with BJ Penn was, oh, I'm going to keep it standing

30:33.800 --> 30:38.880
 up, keep the fight from the outside, you know, because I'm faster than him.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.560
 Then the fight with BJ Penn started.

30:40.560 --> 30:44.360
 I found out that I was not faster than him.

30:44.360 --> 30:49.580
 And I found out that his reaction time was better than mine.

30:49.580 --> 30:54.920
 So I got beat up the first round and I got a bloody nose and everything.

30:54.920 --> 31:00.080
 So my plan B was now I'm going to wrestle him, you know, I'm going to wrestle him and,

31:00.080 --> 31:02.880
 you know, make him tired and trying to put him down.

31:02.880 --> 31:06.580
 And that's how I beat him because I switched gear, you know?

31:06.580 --> 31:10.920
 But if you can't do that, if you cannot find a way to become the perfect nemesis to your

31:10.920 --> 31:17.560
 opponent, you might win a few fights, but you're going to find, you're going to fight

31:17.560 --> 31:23.520
 someone sooner or later that will, that will give you a lot of, a lot of trouble.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.220
 So that's where the anxiety pays off.

31:25.220 --> 31:26.960
 You're anticipating all the ways it goes wrong.

31:26.960 --> 31:34.800
 So you've developed a plan B and plan C. You know, we talked a lot with, like John Donoher,

31:34.800 --> 31:35.800
 who you work with.

31:35.800 --> 31:36.800
 It's interesting.

31:36.800 --> 31:41.920
 I don't think I've heard him talk about plan B and plan C. He usually has a really clear

31:41.920 --> 31:50.400
 plan A, an entire system of plan A. I don't think I've heard him, we've had a good discussion

31:50.400 --> 31:56.040
 about it in, over some cheeseburgers.

31:56.040 --> 32:02.200
 And he's, he was kind of espousing the value of mastering escapes.

32:02.200 --> 32:08.120
 So when you find yourself in bad situations, being exceptionally good at finding ways out

32:08.120 --> 32:11.540
 of those bad situations, and that's a way of dominance.

32:11.540 --> 32:16.680
 There's nothing, there's no better way to dominate your opponent according to him than

32:16.680 --> 32:21.480
 to show that they can't possibly hurt you no matter how bad the position is.

32:21.480 --> 32:25.520
 It's like, it's a, as opposed to a physical dominance, it's a psychological dominance.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.380
 It's very interesting.

32:27.380 --> 32:32.680
 But I wonder if he has plan B and plan C in his mind too.

32:32.680 --> 32:36.600
 You know, in mixed martial arts, sometimes it's like in science, sometimes you can make

32:36.600 --> 32:42.000
 a mistake, you know, like every human can make mistakes, you know.

32:42.000 --> 32:48.960
 There's certain sport or a certain situation that you, if there's a mistake made, that's

32:48.960 --> 32:49.960
 it exactly.

32:49.960 --> 32:55.640
 Sometimes it's the case in MMA, but sometimes you're able to redeem yourself.

32:55.640 --> 33:02.840
 And if you look the fight with BJ Penn 1 that I had, which was probably one of the most

33:02.840 --> 33:08.760
 competitive fight and it was probably the, it was the fight that I got the most damage

33:08.760 --> 33:09.760
 and I was messed up.

33:09.760 --> 33:13.120
 It took me three days, like two, three days to recuperate from that fight.

33:13.120 --> 33:15.200
 I was really damaged.

33:15.200 --> 33:20.560
 And my first fight versus my second fight, I made a lot of adjustment because I have

33:20.560 --> 33:22.860
 learned from my first fight.

33:22.860 --> 33:28.000
 And also I had a guy, one thing people don't know, like they talk about fighters having

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
 secret weapons.

33:29.000 --> 33:34.880
 See, for me, my secret weapons was not like some is that they use like certain, like different

33:34.880 --> 33:35.880
 things.

33:35.880 --> 33:36.880
 For me, it was knowledge.

33:36.880 --> 33:40.000
 I had a guy in Montreal, he was measuring frames.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.120
 He's not a scientist, he's a friend of Ferras and I.

33:44.120 --> 33:47.800
 And what he does, he watch fight and he measure frames.

33:47.800 --> 33:52.840
 The way he does it is when you watch a fight and one of the guy throw a punch, he cut

33:52.840 --> 33:56.680
 the picture by frame, the video by frame.

33:56.680 --> 34:02.960
 So he's able to see which fighter has better reaction time than others.

34:02.960 --> 34:08.560
 And BJ Penn, he found out that BJ Penn of all the UFC roster at the time when he was

34:08.560 --> 34:13.000
 in his prime, he had probably the best reaction time of all.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.960
 According to him, Lyoto Machido was the second one, but BJ Penn was the first one.

34:17.960 --> 34:23.960
 So I knew that if I would try to go first, because I always been the fastest guy normally

34:23.960 --> 34:25.800
 when I fight someone.

34:25.800 --> 34:32.040
 But when I fought BJ Penn, I tried to go first and he was always able to like, I never was

34:32.040 --> 34:37.760
 never able to touch him with my jab and he came back with a counter punch.

34:37.760 --> 34:43.600
 However, because of what he told me, I knew that BJ Penn has a very fast reaction time,

34:43.600 --> 34:47.140
 but had a very poor reset time.

34:47.140 --> 34:52.000
 To him, the way he described it to me is like your nervous system is like a muscle.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.380
 BJ Penn was so fast, but he's like more like a sprinter.

34:55.380 --> 34:59.480
 So when I did the second fight, when I fought BJ Penn, I made him flinch.

34:59.480 --> 35:00.480
 Like I fake a lot.

35:00.480 --> 35:02.240
 So I make him react and flinch.

35:02.240 --> 35:10.240
 So all that reaction time that he used to flinch was not used properly to avoid my punches.

35:10.240 --> 35:17.420
 So I burn, I load up his nervous system with a lot of information and fake and to make

35:17.420 --> 35:21.720
 him flinch and pretending I was kicking and wrestling.

35:21.720 --> 35:25.740
 So he got overwhelmed and he got tired very, very fast.

35:25.740 --> 35:27.080
 So that's how I beat him.

35:27.080 --> 35:31.080
 People sometimes they don't know really what's the strategy behind the thing.

35:31.080 --> 35:32.560
 They only see the physical part.

35:32.560 --> 35:36.400
 But when you fight someone, if I fight you, I look at you in the eyes, there's a lot of

35:36.400 --> 35:39.000
 things that going on between you and I.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.680
 I can look down here, bam, jab you in the face.

35:42.680 --> 35:47.340
 The audience will not see these little detail, but you will see it.

35:47.340 --> 35:50.640
 And that's what makes the magic during a fight.

35:50.640 --> 35:55.040
 The relation that you have with the opponent, you know, like the mental game, what you make

35:55.040 --> 35:56.040
 him believe.

35:56.040 --> 35:58.680
 Those little things, I use a lot of those.

35:58.680 --> 36:02.760
 If you talk to a lot of my opponents, they'll tell you, like, I use a lot of these little

36:02.760 --> 36:06.680
 things, you know, like I look down at Banner, I go up or I am pretending I want to attack

36:06.680 --> 36:12.480
 you so I make you flinch, but in reality, I'm just doing this because I want to rest.

36:12.480 --> 36:15.560
 I want to recuperate and I'm tired.

36:15.560 --> 36:18.720
 How much is, you know, people talk about that with poker, for example.

36:18.720 --> 36:21.420
 How much is the value of this?

36:21.420 --> 36:26.640
 You know, so like some people argue that poker is more about the betting, you know, just

36:26.640 --> 36:27.640
 the money.

36:27.640 --> 36:29.200
 It's just how much you bet and so on.

36:29.200 --> 36:35.600
 So that would be more like the analogy there with with fighting would be just strictly

36:35.600 --> 36:37.600
 the physical movement of your body.

36:37.600 --> 36:41.440
 And then a lot of people argue that there's a lot here in the way you look and the little

36:41.440 --> 36:42.440
 movements in the face.

36:42.440 --> 36:47.240
 So do you think there's, do you think you're communicating with your opponent when you

36:47.240 --> 36:49.000
 look at them?

36:49.000 --> 36:51.320
 There's no way to know for sure, 100 percent.

36:51.320 --> 36:54.640
 And I'm by no, no mean psychic, nothing like that.

36:54.640 --> 36:56.280
 And I don't believe in that at all.

36:56.280 --> 37:01.720
 The only thing is I know through looking through the eyes of my opponent when he's afraid and

37:01.720 --> 37:03.600
 when he gives up on me.

37:03.600 --> 37:09.480
 I've been accused very often in my career to not take enough risk, to not finish my

37:09.480 --> 37:10.480
 opponent.

37:10.480 --> 37:14.840
 But the reason why I didn't finish my opponent is because I saw in his eyes that he gave

37:14.840 --> 37:15.840
 up.

37:15.840 --> 37:17.920
 He gave me the fight and I'm winning the fight.

37:17.920 --> 37:21.720
 So it's not up to me.

37:21.720 --> 37:25.720
 It's not to me to make it, to try to sacrifice myself trying to finish him.

37:25.720 --> 37:33.260
 Perhaps if I do that, I will open up for him to capitalize on my mistake.

37:33.260 --> 37:35.960
 It's up to him to make a risk.

37:35.960 --> 37:40.440
 So people sometimes they don't understand that is the art of fighting, my friend, you

37:40.440 --> 37:45.200
 know, like if I'm winning the fight like an hockey, an ice hockey, if you're winning the

37:45.200 --> 37:49.460
 game and it's the third period, it's at the end of the third period, you're not going

37:49.460 --> 37:55.240
 to take out your goaltender trying to score another goal because winning five to three

37:55.240 --> 37:58.060
 or five to four is the same thing.

37:58.060 --> 37:59.060
 Same thing in MMA.

37:59.060 --> 38:00.840
 We make a living out of this.

38:00.840 --> 38:06.800
 And sometimes as bad as it can be, you want to save yourself for another day, you know,

38:06.800 --> 38:09.120
 you want to minimize the damage.

38:09.120 --> 38:13.760
 But if he knows he's losing the fight, it's up to him to take the risk.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.580
 It's not up to me.

38:15.580 --> 38:17.360
 So I'm a good counter fighter.

38:17.360 --> 38:23.960
 I use a lot of my attack or counter strike or reactive take down or proactive take down.

38:23.960 --> 38:25.540
 That's my specialty.

38:25.540 --> 38:31.720
 So I'm not going to I have no desire to sacrifice myself trying to try to finish my opponent

38:31.720 --> 38:38.160
 if he want to, if perhaps I might give him the opportunity to capitalize on me.

38:38.160 --> 38:42.080
 It's not it's not smart to do that.

38:42.080 --> 38:46.760
 And very often when I fight someone, I can read him, I see the fear in his eyes.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.680
 Now I'm like, I got you now.

38:48.680 --> 38:49.680
 He's very desperate.

38:49.680 --> 38:54.280
 That doesn't mean I have to put my guard down because he's going to be desperate.

38:54.280 --> 38:56.080
 But I know I'm beating you.

38:56.080 --> 38:57.080
 And I know I'm beating you.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.080
 I'm just going to do what I need.

38:58.080 --> 39:00.420
 You know, if I have a chance, of course, I'll knock him out.

39:00.420 --> 39:04.320
 But I'm not going to try to sacrifice myself to knock him out.

39:04.320 --> 39:10.800
 And if you do that, maybe one day you'll make a mistake and you'll get dropped and you'll

39:10.800 --> 39:14.440
 you'll tell yourself, I shoot, I just got brain damage.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.040
 Maybe I'm never going to come back the same.

39:16.040 --> 39:21.320
 Maybe you know, I ruined my career or, you know, it's a it's a very serious game that

39:21.320 --> 39:22.320
 we're playing.

39:22.320 --> 39:23.640
 It's very dangerous.

39:23.640 --> 39:30.120
 In the face of that risk, I mean, Mike Tyson talked about, you know, when the opponent

39:30.120 --> 39:38.120
 looks away, he knows he's got him, right, that that he's broken.

39:38.120 --> 39:44.080
 For a person like me who has trouble making eye contact with people, there's truth to

39:44.080 --> 39:45.080
 that.

39:45.080 --> 39:49.400
 I mean, there's truth to that, that there's an animal nature to us looking away.

39:49.400 --> 39:54.800
 I mean, you could see that the way the body language, the way the eyes move between two

39:54.800 --> 40:01.880
 animals going at it in the wild when like two lions fight or two whatever fight.

40:01.880 --> 40:06.520
 There's a certain beta move when you've you've been defeated.

40:06.520 --> 40:07.520
 Yes.

40:07.520 --> 40:13.040
 Or one thing when I know that, that when it happened, one of the signs is when I just

40:13.040 --> 40:16.200
 like make a faint and the guy flinched like crazy.

40:16.200 --> 40:17.960
 That's mean he's really scared of me.

40:17.960 --> 40:21.320
 It's a little bit like you're you're you're doing this, that guy flinched a little bit

40:21.320 --> 40:22.320
 or you're doing this.

40:22.320 --> 40:26.920
 He's like, oh, that's mean you hurt him and he doesn't want to get hurt again.

40:26.920 --> 40:34.060
 So he's really trying to run away and not not winning the fight anymore, but not losing

40:34.060 --> 40:36.780
 sort of surviving the five round.

40:36.780 --> 40:42.680
 And it's hard to to finish a guy who does doesn't want to fight a guy who's not fighting

40:42.680 --> 40:45.600
 anymore to win in this fighting to not lose.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.820
 And the proof of that, if you don't believe me, just look the reign of all the greatest

40:48.820 --> 40:49.820
 champion in UFC.

40:49.820 --> 40:55.880
 I don't care who they are, John Jones or like you could clearly see that in the beginning

40:55.880 --> 40:59.860
 of their reign, they could, you know, finish a lot of their opponents, the same as me in

40:59.860 --> 41:00.860
 the beginning.

41:00.860 --> 41:02.120
 I was finishing a lot of my opponent.

41:02.120 --> 41:08.720
 But there is a time that the entire UFC roster is studying you and they found ways to perhaps

41:08.720 --> 41:15.360
 not beating you, but they found a way to navigate to the fight in a way that they minimize the

41:15.360 --> 41:16.360
 damage.

41:16.360 --> 41:17.360
 You know what I mean?

41:17.360 --> 41:22.560
 So it's a big difference between fighting to win and fighting to not lose.

41:22.560 --> 41:26.040
 You said that there's a difference between a fighter and a martial artist.

41:26.040 --> 41:28.440
 So now we were talking about fighting.

41:28.440 --> 41:32.960
 You're considered by many to be one of the greatest fighters of all time.

41:32.960 --> 41:37.760
 But you said that there's a difference between a fighter and a martial artist.

41:37.760 --> 41:39.680
 A fighter is training for a purpose.

41:39.680 --> 41:41.320
 He has a fight.

41:41.320 --> 41:43.680
 I'm I'm a martial artist.

41:43.680 --> 41:44.960
 I don't train for a fight.

41:44.960 --> 41:46.440
 I train for myself.

41:46.440 --> 41:48.120
 I'm training all the time.

41:48.120 --> 41:52.640
 My goal is perfection, but I will never reach perfection.

41:52.640 --> 41:57.220
 So what to you does it mean to be a martial artist?

41:57.220 --> 42:04.120
 Martial artist is because that lifestyle that I have has been introduced to me and the seed

42:04.120 --> 42:09.440
 has been planted to my mind a long, long time ago by my father.

42:09.440 --> 42:15.040
 I am I do not train because I have a fight.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.440
 I will always train.

42:16.440 --> 42:23.880
 Even now, it kind of amused me that to see that a lot of people, because I'm still training,

42:23.880 --> 42:25.700
 because I love the science of fighting.

42:25.700 --> 42:28.240
 I do not like to fight, but I love the science of it.

42:28.240 --> 42:31.480
 And I will always do it as long as I can do it.

42:31.480 --> 42:33.440
 People think I'm going to make a comeback and everything.

42:33.440 --> 42:36.720
 I'm I'm about to get to have 40 years old.

42:36.720 --> 42:44.440
 You know, like it's I'm, you know, like I don't want to fight in a cage at 40 years

42:44.440 --> 42:45.440
 old.

42:45.440 --> 42:46.440
 I mean, some people have done it.

42:46.440 --> 42:47.440
 They did it very well.

42:47.440 --> 42:48.760
 But I'm not one of them.

42:48.760 --> 42:52.880
 I'm I feel a little bit to me that.

42:52.880 --> 42:57.840
 And you never say never feel like to me like it's a little like a kid that you play with

42:57.840 --> 43:02.560
 the strain when he's young, like when he's five years old, six years old, seven years

43:02.560 --> 43:03.560
 old, eight years old.

43:03.560 --> 43:07.000
 But then I was like, what the hell I'm doing here?

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
 And I'm too old for this.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
 I like it.

43:09.000 --> 43:16.520
 So I have done it, you know, and and I got out of it on top.

43:16.520 --> 43:20.920
 And I'm I'm healthy, which is the most important thing right now, touching wood.

43:20.920 --> 43:22.760
 And I'm I'm wealthy.

43:22.760 --> 43:23.840
 I beat the game.

43:23.840 --> 43:24.840
 You know what I mean?

43:24.840 --> 43:27.520
 In a way, like that's not to be cocky, but I did it.

43:27.520 --> 43:31.040
 And I wish more more fighters could do the same thing.

43:31.040 --> 43:36.960
 I wish, but it's unfortunate because a lot of them, they stay there and hang out for

43:36.960 --> 43:39.160
 too long and they get badly hurt.

43:39.160 --> 43:48.600
 They get beaten and broken, you know, and they finish broke as well, because the lifestyle

43:48.600 --> 43:53.560
 you have when you're a pro athlete, it's crazy, you know, it's it's it's unbelievable.

43:53.560 --> 43:59.160
 However, everything that goes up and life goes down and you need to plan your future,

43:59.160 --> 44:00.160
 you know.

44:00.160 --> 44:04.600
 And for for me, what if some guys have the same mentality as me and they're watching

44:04.600 --> 44:10.160
 us right now, I would say if you do it because you're just good at it, you like the money,

44:10.160 --> 44:14.800
 the advantage, the freedom that it gives you, but you don't necessarily like to fight.

44:14.800 --> 44:20.360
 When you're done, you finish on top, you know, go go cash out and get out of the way.

44:20.360 --> 44:21.360
 Yes.

44:21.360 --> 44:22.360
 Hard to do.

44:22.360 --> 44:25.500
 However, actually, it's not everybody that does it for that reason.

44:25.500 --> 44:28.940
 Some people generally love to fight, love to compete.

44:28.940 --> 44:32.520
 So they do it because they love it, you know, or they do it because of the money.

44:32.520 --> 44:36.400
 But if you don't love it, if you don't like to fight because it's very stressful and you

44:36.400 --> 44:39.740
 don't enjoy you, you enjoy the training, perhaps, but you don't like to fight.

44:39.740 --> 44:44.520
 You do it because it's part of what you need to do in order to keep that lifestyle.

44:44.520 --> 44:49.640
 And you know, like you don't need the money to get out of here, man.

44:49.640 --> 44:51.860
 If you're in your you're in your prime, get out of here.

44:51.860 --> 44:56.780
 Because if you don't, you'll hurt your own legacy, you'll damage your health.

44:56.780 --> 45:03.560
 It's very sad and it's a it's a sad business, you know what I mean?

45:03.560 --> 45:12.160
 It's like a lot of what one of the place where is the one of the most happiest place for

45:12.160 --> 45:15.320
 me to go and the most saddest place for me to go.

45:15.320 --> 45:20.800
 It's in the gym, Tristar in Montreal, because it's one of the happiest place for me to go

45:20.800 --> 45:24.820
 because I can go train and do what I love to do.

45:24.820 --> 45:28.860
 But it's also a very sad place for me because after when I'm about to leave, there's always

45:28.860 --> 45:35.440
 a bunch of young kid that comes or guys that are around 30, 33 years old.

45:35.440 --> 45:38.960
 And they come to me and say, hey, George, you have some advice for me.

45:38.960 --> 45:41.680
 And I look at them.

45:41.680 --> 45:45.040
 And if they're my friend, they're real close friend of mine, I'll tell them the truth in

45:45.040 --> 45:46.320
 their face.

45:46.320 --> 45:49.000
 And I've done it many times and it was not well received.

45:49.000 --> 45:53.200
 But if they're not my friend, I have to, you know, you know, it's always an advice about

45:53.200 --> 45:55.380
 fighting and I answer their question.

45:55.380 --> 45:56.560
 It's my pleasure.

45:56.560 --> 46:02.960
 But the truth, if they they want me to tell the truth, the big majority of them, I would

46:02.960 --> 46:10.160
 tell them, I said, listen, man, you're in maybe three, like on a losing street of three

46:10.160 --> 46:11.160
 fight.

46:11.160 --> 46:16.880
 You're 30, 33 years old, you know, I think you should think about doing something else

46:16.880 --> 46:17.880
 in your life.

46:17.880 --> 46:21.480
 You know, I have other goals, you know, because you're not going to make it.

46:21.480 --> 46:26.720
 And, you know, I've seen that movie before and it's a very sad ending.

46:26.720 --> 46:31.120
 And I'm I'm sad to tell you the truth because you're not going to make the money.

46:31.120 --> 46:32.560
 You just choose some.

46:32.560 --> 46:35.960
 But if I tell them that they're going to be angry at me because they'll be like, oh, you

46:35.960 --> 46:37.780
 you make it and you think I cannot make it.

46:37.780 --> 46:40.400
 So it's kind of they're going to think I'm cocky.

46:40.400 --> 46:42.000
 But I was lucky to make it.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.640
 You know, at the start, we're all aligned.

46:43.640 --> 46:49.320
 But at one point, you need to be able to to have a plan B, you know, like like some parent

46:49.320 --> 46:56.080
 they come to see me with their kids and this is the future world champion in the UFC.

46:56.080 --> 46:57.920
 And what advice would you give him?

46:57.920 --> 46:59.540
 I always tell the same thing.

46:59.540 --> 47:01.440
 And it does not make everybody happy.

47:01.440 --> 47:05.740
 When I said I say I go to the case, a are you good at school?

47:05.740 --> 47:07.000
 Say stay at school.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.560
 School is very important for you.

47:08.560 --> 47:09.560
 Stay educated.

47:09.560 --> 47:10.560
 Yeah.

47:10.560 --> 47:13.040
 Do boxing, martial arts, a great sport.

47:13.040 --> 47:17.320
 Stay in shape, but don't put your eggs all in the same basket.

47:17.320 --> 47:20.360
 And the parents sometime are angry when I'm not angry, but I can see in their eyes, they're

47:20.360 --> 47:24.560
 like they kind of surprised.

47:24.560 --> 47:30.440
 And it's not because I made it that I will tell the kid to follow the same path that

47:30.440 --> 47:31.440
 I did.

47:31.440 --> 47:37.360
 I went to school to I've studied, I dropped off school when I had my first world championship

47:37.360 --> 47:39.400
 fight against Matt Hughes.

47:39.400 --> 47:41.480
 But before that, I was in school.

47:41.480 --> 47:48.120
 Quite another, you know, another way to go if things would not have gone the same, the

47:48.120 --> 47:49.120
 way I wanted.

47:49.120 --> 47:53.440
 But the problem and I'm saying that it's not only about boxing in MMA, I'm talking about

47:53.440 --> 47:56.660
 hockey, basketball, baseball, same, same thing.

47:56.660 --> 47:59.820
 Maybe it's the one on the hundred thousand that make it.

47:59.820 --> 48:02.920
 And I'm saying I'm saying that make it when I'm saying I make it.

48:02.920 --> 48:08.360
 That's mean they can retire and have enough money for the rest of his life because it's

48:08.360 --> 48:09.360
 a sad story.

48:09.360 --> 48:13.000
 The only people only heard about the people that makes it.

48:13.000 --> 48:18.440
 But a lot of fighters, even a UFC champion in boxing, champion, even in football, basketball,

48:18.440 --> 48:19.720
 I don't I don't I don't care.

48:19.720 --> 48:22.120
 Big names when they retire, they have zero.

48:22.120 --> 48:23.940
 They're bankrupt, my friend.

48:23.940 --> 48:29.660
 And it's a very sad, sad story and a sad reality that most people are not aware of.

48:29.660 --> 48:36.160
 But having other paths in life actually can also increase the chance of you dominating

48:36.160 --> 48:39.520
 and like reaching the highest peak in your main thing.

48:39.520 --> 48:45.020
 I mean, Jimmy Pager, I don't know if you know who that is, is a judo coach in in America.

48:45.020 --> 48:49.120
 He was he says that to all of his athletes is to make sure that you go.

48:49.120 --> 48:52.600
 He has a lot of, you know, Kayla Harrison, two time Olympic gold medalist.

48:52.600 --> 48:55.220
 He has a lot of Olympic medalists.

48:55.220 --> 48:59.740
 But basically, there's something about going to school, like having an forget school, any

48:59.740 --> 49:07.280
 other avenue in life that gives you the freedom to go all out in your main like that, you

49:07.280 --> 49:09.520
 know, you're doing it for the right reasons.

49:09.520 --> 49:11.080
 You're not stuck.

49:11.080 --> 49:17.320
 It clears the mind to where you're free to be the best in the world as opposed to kind

49:17.320 --> 49:18.320
 of you have to.

49:18.320 --> 49:21.320
 I mean, different people are motivated by different things.

49:21.320 --> 49:26.160
 So sometimes some people like having their back to the wall and that's the only option

49:26.160 --> 49:27.160
 they have.

49:27.160 --> 49:30.400
 But most people, I think, excel when you have other options.

49:30.400 --> 49:35.160
 I think it's a distraction and I think it's important to have a distraction.

49:35.160 --> 49:38.720
 When you say that, I think about one of my coach, John Danaher.

49:38.720 --> 49:43.840
 He put his academic background experience into jiu jitsu.

49:43.840 --> 49:49.560
 And that for me, that's why he's the best teacher I ever had is incredible.

49:49.560 --> 49:56.020
 He start teaching me when I even couldn't speak much English at the time and I was able

49:56.020 --> 50:00.680
 to communicate and understand, you know, that's how good he is.

50:00.680 --> 50:07.040
 But I truly believe that most of the athletes, especially in sport like mixed martial arts,

50:07.040 --> 50:08.440
 train way too much.

50:08.440 --> 50:16.660
 If I could go back and talk to a young George, I would tell him, you do way too much volume.

50:16.660 --> 50:20.780
 You train way too hard, train smarter, it's more important.

50:20.780 --> 50:29.160
 And I think sometimes we underestimate the benefit of recuperation because I think we

50:29.160 --> 50:35.920
 assimilate the information that we learn during a training when we recuperate and not during

50:35.920 --> 50:37.800
 the training itself.

50:37.800 --> 50:47.120
 And this whole mentality of harder, heavier, you know, it's good for someone who's lazy.

50:47.120 --> 50:51.440
 And if you're an elite athlete, most of the time, you know, like you're not always, but

50:51.440 --> 50:54.760
 most of the time is because you're not lazy.

50:54.760 --> 51:00.360
 And a lot of guys, sometimes they're elite athletes, champions, and you'll hear people

51:00.360 --> 51:05.040
 say, oh, I can't believe he's very gifted, but he doesn't work.

51:05.040 --> 51:09.880
 But perhaps it's not really because perhaps it's because we don't understand, perhaps

51:09.880 --> 51:14.980
 he's doing the right thing and it's us who's working too much and too hard.

51:14.980 --> 51:17.100
 That's what I think.

51:17.100 --> 51:21.720
 There's a guy I train with, he made me think about it.

51:21.720 --> 51:28.000
 His name is Mansour Barnaoui, he's going to be a future star, he's an incredible fighter.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.260
 He trained once a day.

51:31.260 --> 51:34.120
 And he asked me some time advice when he came to Montreal, he's from France.

51:34.120 --> 51:37.920
 You'll hear about him, he's very good.

51:37.920 --> 51:43.080
 And I saw him in the morning at TriStar and I said, okay, I'll see you perhaps later in

51:43.080 --> 51:44.080
 the other trainings.

51:44.080 --> 51:46.680
 He said, no, I only train once a day.

51:46.680 --> 51:54.880
 And he kind of waits for me to give him like, not an approval, but like to see how I react

51:54.880 --> 51:59.680
 or, you know, I don't know, it was kind of a strange feeling, but I told myself at that

51:59.680 --> 52:08.560
 point I kind of had an awakening and I told myself, man, maybe he's doing the right thing.

52:08.560 --> 52:14.120
 Because a lot of people would say, for example, oh, that's a lazy way of doing it, but perhaps

52:14.120 --> 52:15.680
 it's the best way to do it.

52:15.680 --> 52:18.640
 I'm not saying that training once a day is the best way to do it.

52:18.640 --> 52:19.640
 That's what I'm saying.

52:19.640 --> 52:26.100
 I'm saying that everybody's different, but for him, it works beautifully.

52:26.100 --> 52:31.800
 And I wouldn't change anything, you know, like if I would be him because he's improving

52:31.800 --> 52:32.800
 like crazy.

52:32.800 --> 52:33.800
 Yeah.

52:33.800 --> 52:39.920
 And ultimately the bigger picture there is to do something that everyone else says is

52:39.920 --> 52:40.920
 stupid.

52:40.920 --> 52:45.580
 It's like the fasting thing that a lot of people would say, a lot of nutritional experts

52:45.580 --> 52:48.480
 would say that that's a dumb way.

52:48.480 --> 52:52.600
 You know, if you want to be an MMA fighter, you should be eating like many times a day.

52:52.600 --> 52:55.080
 You should be starting every day with oatmeal.

52:55.080 --> 53:00.120
 You should be carving up constantly, but that's not necessarily true for everybody.

53:00.120 --> 53:01.120
 And it's possible.

53:01.120 --> 53:04.320
 I'm sure there's actually now a few MMA fighters that are carnivore only.

53:04.320 --> 53:05.360
 It's possible.

53:05.360 --> 53:11.440
 I used to eat right before training and it didn't bother me.

53:11.440 --> 53:23.960
 However, now my first training that I do normally in average around noon, 11 a.m., I haven't

53:23.960 --> 53:26.000
 eaten anything when I do my first training.

53:26.000 --> 53:32.200
 And it feels to me that I'm much more clear in my mind.

53:32.200 --> 53:33.800
 I'm much more creative.

53:33.800 --> 53:34.800
 I feel better.

53:34.800 --> 53:35.800
 Yeah.

53:35.800 --> 53:36.800
 Yeah.

53:36.800 --> 53:37.800
 It's a big difference.

53:37.800 --> 53:38.800
 I just wish I would have known that before.

53:38.800 --> 53:42.080
 Well, it's fascinating, the role of the mind in all of this.

53:42.080 --> 53:48.440
 How important is it for your mind to be clear, to really think deeply?

53:48.440 --> 53:53.600
 There's a judoka American named Travis Stevens.

53:53.600 --> 54:01.840
 I remember he said something that the right kind of practice is when your mind is exhausted

54:01.840 --> 54:08.640
 at the end of it, that you were constantly thinking through things like your body shouldn't

54:08.640 --> 54:12.160
 be exhausted first, your mind should be exhausted first.

54:12.160 --> 54:13.360
 It's really fascinating.

54:13.360 --> 54:20.120
 So people think about training hard, you know, a successful practice is where you walk away

54:20.120 --> 54:23.760
 just overwhelmed how much you had to think.

54:23.760 --> 54:27.360
 It's fascinating framing of a successful practice.

54:27.360 --> 54:28.440
 It's true.

54:28.440 --> 54:32.920
 Travis Stevens was one of my main training partner when I got ready for my fight with

54:32.920 --> 54:38.080
 Nick Diaz and Carlos Candit.

54:38.080 --> 54:44.600
 He drove every Friday from, I believe, Boston.

54:44.600 --> 54:47.600
 It's like a six hour drive.

54:47.600 --> 54:58.480
 Drive to the gym in Montreal, train with us an hour and a half, drive back.

54:58.480 --> 55:01.320
 He's got such an amazing discipline.

55:01.320 --> 55:06.200
 I was so happy for him when he won the medal at the Olympic game.

55:06.200 --> 55:12.640
 And what a well deserved, you know, accomplishment.

55:12.640 --> 55:13.640
 It's unbelievable.

55:13.640 --> 55:14.640
 It paid off.

55:14.640 --> 55:16.680
 You know, I was so happy for him.

55:16.680 --> 55:26.160
 And every time we got to the gym, he was waiting for me in the kneeling position like a soldier.

55:26.160 --> 55:31.720
 I was like, my God, this guy is made of steel, you know.

55:31.720 --> 55:36.160
 And after training, I always offer him, I say, Travis, I know you like to train with

55:36.160 --> 55:41.720
 that because in Montreal, they have very good judo team, Nicholas Gill and all those guys.

55:41.720 --> 55:45.040
 And I say, if you want to stay, I'll get you at the hotel, you know, like anything

55:45.040 --> 55:46.040
 you want.

55:46.040 --> 55:47.040
 He's like, no, no, I got to go back.

55:47.040 --> 55:48.040
 I have another training later.

55:48.040 --> 55:53.200
 I'm like, not only did he train with us, he had to go back because he had another training.

55:53.200 --> 55:55.440
 I'm like, this is insane.

55:55.440 --> 55:57.880
 And he's gone through a huge number of injuries.

55:57.880 --> 56:04.200
 So he's also an innovator because, I mean, it's difficult to say, but for American judo,

56:04.200 --> 56:06.820
 there's not many high level judoka.

56:06.820 --> 56:12.760
 So if you want to be the, like fight with the best in the world, you have to be alone.

56:12.760 --> 56:14.600
 It's a lonely journey, actually.

56:14.600 --> 56:16.680
 It's kind of sad.

56:16.680 --> 56:19.880
 It's much easier to be in Japan where everybody's a killer.

56:19.880 --> 56:23.320
 When you're alone at it, it's a difficult journey.

56:23.320 --> 56:31.640
 And you know, it's funny we talked about kind of, there's some sports where a mistake is,

56:31.640 --> 56:32.640
 that's it.

56:32.640 --> 56:34.520
 You can't recover from a mistake.

56:34.520 --> 56:43.360
 I think judo oftentimes is one of those sports and added on top of that is the Olympics only

56:43.360 --> 56:45.480
 every four years.

56:45.480 --> 56:50.640
 And Travis's story, he's the reason I, when I saw him in 2008, cause I started martial

56:50.640 --> 56:51.640
 arts.

56:51.640 --> 56:58.200
 I switched from like wrestling and street fighting to doing jiu jitsu and judo.

56:58.200 --> 57:00.200
 And I just saw so much guts.

57:00.200 --> 57:07.400
 And the, in 2000, I might be messing up the years here, but in the next Olympics he fought

57:07.400 --> 57:11.280
 and he lost on just the referee call.

57:11.280 --> 57:12.280
 Yeah.

57:12.280 --> 57:18.840
 And just, he went to war and he just so much guts and just everything on the line and to

57:18.840 --> 57:23.400
 lose and then to still persevere through all the injuries, through all of that, through

57:23.400 --> 57:28.200
 incredibly difficult training sessions to go another four years and then compete and

57:28.200 --> 57:29.200
 then win a medal.

57:29.200 --> 57:35.320
 I mean, that guy's just, and like he clearly could have been very successful.

57:35.320 --> 57:37.560
 He's also an incredible jiu jitsu competitor.

57:37.560 --> 57:41.520
 So he could have switched to that, but he's stuck.

57:41.520 --> 57:49.160
 In a lot of sport, when you're in elite, like for example, in Canada, ice hockey is the

57:49.160 --> 57:52.520
 number one sport of the countries.

57:52.520 --> 57:57.680
 Kids when they're in elite, when they're young, they get chosen and they're kind of already

57:57.680 --> 58:02.080
 known as a superstar.

58:02.080 --> 58:06.200
 The school where they go and the program they follow, like I'm sure it's the same thing

58:06.200 --> 58:14.040
 in the US and basketball, baseball, perhaps American football, because they already chosen.

58:14.040 --> 58:21.760
 So they grew up with that, that it's secure, that superstar stardom, so to speak.

58:21.760 --> 58:25.440
 And it's already sort of glamorous.

58:25.440 --> 58:34.680
 However, in MMA, there's no MMA, judo, wrestling, like in America, because it's not our national

58:34.680 --> 58:40.400
 sport, it's actually, it's not like, even when I first started, it was not really well

58:40.400 --> 58:42.680
 received by the media.

58:42.680 --> 58:45.360
 There's no glamor into it.

58:45.360 --> 58:48.840
 Now I don't know, it seems like it's another era now.

58:48.840 --> 58:55.120
 And I feel sometimes that some people do it for the wrong reason.

58:55.120 --> 59:00.160
 You know, some people do it because of the glamor, because of the money.

59:00.160 --> 59:06.080
 But even if you're an elite and very good, the glamor and the money won't come in the

59:06.080 --> 59:07.720
 beginning.

59:07.720 --> 59:13.480
 It's a very long grind before, you know, it starts to come in.

59:13.480 --> 59:16.280
 And you need to make those sacrifices.

59:16.280 --> 59:23.520
 And it's a journey where you will be tested, you will be hurt repetitively.

59:23.520 --> 59:28.920
 And you're going to have to reach the down deep and come back up.

59:28.920 --> 59:33.720
 And then once you finally think you made it, you're going to go back in the down deep again.

59:33.720 --> 59:39.880
 It's a very exhausting and decaraging adventure sometimes.

59:39.880 --> 59:46.160
 But if you hold on to your dream and you believe in it, you know, and you have the stars aligned,

59:46.160 --> 59:47.720
 you're going to make it.

59:47.720 --> 59:51.800
 That's why it's only a few people that make it, you know.

59:51.800 --> 59:57.360
 And that's why I feel sometimes that a lot of people in the new generation do it for

59:57.360 --> 59:58.360
 the wrong reason.

59:58.360 --> 1:00:02.600
 In my generation, because of sport, at first there were no rules.

1:00:02.600 --> 1:00:04.880
 I thought it was more pure.

1:00:04.880 --> 1:00:08.040
 The people that did it was really because of the passion.

1:00:08.040 --> 1:00:11.880
 We didn't seek money, fame.

1:00:11.880 --> 1:00:14.040
 We did it because we wanted to be...

1:00:14.040 --> 1:00:16.560
 I did it because I wanted to be the man, you know.

1:00:16.560 --> 1:00:21.480
 I like to have the confidence that when I walk somewhere, you know, I have the confidence

1:00:21.480 --> 1:00:26.160
 that, you know, it's an illusion because nobody is faster than a bullet.

1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:29.920
 But I wanted to achieve it for myself.

1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:36.960
 Which today now, because I don't know if it's social media and all that, the world has changed.

1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:42.120
 The glamour, you know, I feel it's a different thing right now.

1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:47.880
 Yeah, if you get in it for the glamour or the money, you may not have the right amount

1:00:47.880 --> 1:00:51.600
 of fuel to persevere through all the ups and downs, for sure.

1:00:51.600 --> 1:01:00.480
 You know, when you talk about motivation of money and glamour, a guy comes to mind, and

1:01:00.480 --> 1:01:06.800
 I don't know how many wrestlers, you know, but in Russia, there's a guy named Bovassiy

1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:07.800
 Satiev.

1:01:07.800 --> 1:01:15.000
 The Satiev brothers, one of the greatest freestyle wrestlers of all time, but he also has...

1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:16.560
 It's funny that he doesn't have many interviews.

1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:21.160
 One of my goals is to go out and talk to him in Russian, do an interview with him because

1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:24.640
 he's exceptionally poetic and a deep thinker.

1:01:24.640 --> 1:01:29.720
 He's the kind of martial artist that you are in the way that it's not just about the different

1:01:29.720 --> 1:01:31.820
 battles you've been through or whatever.

1:01:31.820 --> 1:01:35.000
 It's about the philosophy behind the way he approaches life.

1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:41.400
 Now, he has spoken quite a bit about that the glamour, the fame, the money are all things

1:01:41.400 --> 1:01:50.040
 that get in the way of the purity of the experience, the art, that the way to achieve greatness

1:01:50.040 --> 1:01:58.620
 is to just lose yourself in the art of the actual combat, in his case, it's wrestling,

1:01:58.620 --> 1:02:05.720
 and then kind of not to worry and actively make sure that you block out anybody who,

1:02:05.720 --> 1:02:10.840
 you know, feeds you the narrative where you're supposed to be this famous person and all

1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:16.920
 those kinds of things that he basically says, let others write your story.

1:02:16.920 --> 1:02:19.440
 Make sure that you just focus on the art.

1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:25.680
 And another person from that side of the world is, of course, Khabib, so he represents that

1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:26.680
 side of the world.

1:02:26.680 --> 1:02:32.080
 And we were talking about walking away and most people not being able to walk away at

1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:39.520
 the top as you have, but also now Khabib has, it looks like, incredibly so.

1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:45.360
 I mean, maybe you can comment about what your thoughts are about Khabib Nurmagomedov being

1:02:45.360 --> 1:02:47.800
 able to just walk away.

1:02:47.800 --> 1:02:53.520
 You know, we talk about the GOAT very often, Khabib is, you know, one of, isn't the argument

1:02:53.520 --> 1:03:01.960
 because he has the most dominant carrier of all martial art, the guy, you know, some guys

1:03:01.960 --> 1:03:07.760
 can be named the GOAT for different reasons, but Khabib for that reason, and he's undefeated.

1:03:07.760 --> 1:03:15.360
 I don't even know if he lost, he might have lost a round, but he dominates all his opponents.

1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:22.240
 It was ridiculous and such an incredible career that he had.

1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:27.180
 I love to watch him fight, he's incredible.

1:03:27.180 --> 1:03:35.760
 And when you talk about the art, when you say mixed martial art, the idea of a flawless

1:03:35.760 --> 1:03:43.200
 performance, for me, everybody often, when we say flawless performance, thinks about

1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:46.960
 a knockout, a brutal knockout.

1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:55.880
 But for me, it's to be able to showcase beautiful technique, like a beautiful takedown, beautiful

1:03:55.880 --> 1:04:04.840
 submission, like something beautiful that, you know, when you look at, for example, Wayne

1:04:04.840 --> 1:04:13.360
 Gretzky or Michael Jordan or like Stephen Curry, even if you don't know nothing about

1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:18.720
 basketball and you watch Michael Jordan, you'll be like, wow, that's beautiful what he just

1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:19.720
 did.

1:04:19.720 --> 1:04:25.680
 Like, we talk about fighting and trying to say the word beautiful in fighting for certain

1:04:25.680 --> 1:04:31.320
 people, it could sound kind of crazy, you know, but I'm talking about the technique,

1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:35.320
 a beautiful technique, you know, for me, that's the goal.

1:04:35.320 --> 1:04:39.120
 You know, when I was fighting, it's no need to have a brutal knockout because some people

1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:41.240
 are more gifted than others.

1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:46.240
 I'm saying gifted, some people are better than others in certain phase of fighting.

1:04:46.240 --> 1:04:51.860
 But for me, it was that it was to showcase, to win, of course, but to showcase some beautiful

1:04:51.860 --> 1:04:56.720
 technique that you can watch it and be like, wow, that was incredible.

1:04:56.720 --> 1:04:58.960
 The timing, he did it.

1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:06.480
 And when I think about Khabib Nurmagomedov, I see all the detail of his work, especially

1:05:06.480 --> 1:05:11.520
 when he's got his opponent against the fence, that's like, that's his area of expertise

1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:18.920
 where he's, to me, he's the best that ever did it in terms of that fighting style, that

1:05:18.920 --> 1:05:22.320
 particular expertise that he has, it's just incredible.

1:05:22.320 --> 1:05:25.640
 The flawless execution of that particular set of techniques.

1:05:25.640 --> 1:05:31.340
 And Conor McGregor had the accuracy.

1:05:31.340 --> 1:05:37.440
 The Spider Anderson Silva was like, was, I would say, the most flamboyant of all, you

1:05:37.440 --> 1:05:40.200
 know, like he was moving like the Matrix.

1:05:40.200 --> 1:05:45.640
 Jon Jones was incredible in terms of creativity, spinning elbows and that, and he faced incredible

1:05:45.640 --> 1:05:46.640
 adversity.

1:05:46.640 --> 1:05:51.720
 Dimitrius Johnson was so complete.

1:05:51.720 --> 1:05:54.880
 You could bring, like he was slamming a guy to an armbar.

1:05:54.880 --> 1:05:55.880
 It was just unbelievable.

1:05:55.880 --> 1:05:59.240
 Like, like he was like the complete fighter.

1:05:59.240 --> 1:06:02.200
 BJ Penn was like so flexible.

1:06:02.200 --> 1:06:07.800
 He did stuff with his body that like nobody could do his, the dexterity of his hips was

1:06:07.800 --> 1:06:10.480
 just unbelievable.

1:06:10.480 --> 1:06:15.880
 Dominic Cruz, to me, was incredible, his footwork, his distance control.

1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:20.320
 So when you talk about like the GOAT, Royce Gracie, another one, he did things that I

1:06:20.320 --> 1:06:21.920
 think for me is the number one.

1:06:21.920 --> 1:06:25.520
 Yeah, I gotta, I gotta, and sorry to interrupt, Royce is a fascinating one.

1:06:25.520 --> 1:06:31.480
 I'd love to hear what you think about him, but many people consider you, most people

1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:38.320
 consider you to be the number one greatest mixed martial arts fighter ever.

1:06:38.320 --> 1:06:44.160
 So it's fascinating to remove you from that list and continue this discussion and asking

1:06:44.160 --> 1:06:46.680
 like, who do you think is the greatest fighter ever?

1:06:46.680 --> 1:06:49.560
 You listed some amazing ones, Royce.

1:06:49.560 --> 1:06:51.280
 You somehow skipped Fedor.

1:06:51.280 --> 1:06:53.200
 I'm very, as a Russian, I'm very offended.

1:06:53.200 --> 1:06:55.880
 No, I was, I was going to, there's so many.

1:06:55.880 --> 1:06:57.440
 Fedor is one as well.

1:06:57.440 --> 1:07:02.760
 Fedor, I think in his prime was like, when you say, when you talk about a name, for example,

1:07:02.760 --> 1:07:07.320
 like we talk about him when he was in his prime.

1:07:07.320 --> 1:07:10.520
 Like when I talk, for example, about Anderson Silva, I'm not talking about the Anderson

1:07:10.520 --> 1:07:14.600
 Silva who fought, who fought his last fight against Uriah Hall.

1:07:14.600 --> 1:07:18.080
 I'm talking about the Anderson Silva who knocked out Victor Belfer.

1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:19.080
 Yes.

1:07:19.080 --> 1:07:20.720
 BJ Penn, same thing.

1:07:20.720 --> 1:07:25.400
 The problem is when fighters hang on for too long in the sport.

1:07:25.400 --> 1:07:26.400
 That's what happened.

1:07:26.400 --> 1:07:32.360
 They kind of make, make people forget how good they were.

1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:33.360
 And it's very sad.

1:07:33.360 --> 1:07:38.000
 We talk about Fedor and just, just think about Stipe Miocic.

1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:41.200
 Miocic is probably the greatest heavyweight of all time.

1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:46.320
 With Fedor, I would really wonder who would have won this fight, the both guys in their

1:07:46.320 --> 1:07:47.320
 prime.

1:07:47.320 --> 1:07:52.200
 I tend to lean towards Fedor because my heart was with Fedor, but he could have gone the

1:07:52.200 --> 1:07:53.200
 other way.

1:07:53.200 --> 1:07:57.760
 But just because Miocic lose his last fight, now everybody's like, oh yeah, they forgot

1:07:57.760 --> 1:07:58.920
 about him.

1:07:58.920 --> 1:08:00.360
 It's crazy, man.

1:08:00.360 --> 1:08:01.440
 It's one fight.

1:08:01.440 --> 1:08:04.720
 You zig when you should zag, boom.

1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:06.600
 That's the reality of mixed martial arts.

1:08:06.600 --> 1:08:13.240
 Well, that's why the thing is the mixed martial arts isn't just the performance, the strictly

1:08:13.240 --> 1:08:14.440
 who won and who lost.

1:08:14.440 --> 1:08:16.660
 It's also the stories we tell ourselves.

1:08:16.660 --> 1:08:20.280
 And so, I mean, there's beautiful stories being weaved.

1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:27.760
 And that also is part of who is the greatest of all time is what were the battles, what

1:08:27.760 --> 1:08:29.920
 had to be overcome?

1:08:29.920 --> 1:08:35.160
 What was the flavor of the flawless performances?

1:08:35.160 --> 1:08:39.040
 You know, all of that plays into it and you're right.

1:08:39.040 --> 1:08:42.360
 Being able to walk away at the top is also part of that.

1:08:42.360 --> 1:08:48.200
 A lot of people ask me about Khabib and that fight.

1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:50.080
 I want it to happen.

1:08:50.080 --> 1:08:55.160
 Khabib wanted to happen, but UFC did not want to happen between you and Khabib.

1:08:55.160 --> 1:08:56.160
 Yes.

1:08:56.160 --> 1:09:00.840
 And we tried to make it like about three years ago when I retired, two, no, three, no, it

1:09:00.840 --> 1:09:05.960
 was after two years ago and it never came to fruition.

1:09:05.960 --> 1:09:06.960
 The UFC were clear.

1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:12.080
 They said they have other plan for Khabib and it makes sense for the business standpoint

1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:15.600
 because they want to keep the ball rolling.

1:09:15.600 --> 1:09:21.160
 Now Khabib retired and like everybody else, after Justin Gaethje, I was doing the commentator

1:09:21.160 --> 1:09:26.920
 in French for the UFC and I had Butterfly, I thought he was going to call me out.

1:09:26.920 --> 1:09:30.960
 If there is one guy that I would have said, yes, it would be him, because for a fighter,

1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:37.000
 the most exciting things to do, it's often the scariest one.

1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:40.640
 And Khabib was, you know, the scariest macho.

1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:41.640
 Yes.

1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:47.600
 But he was worth the risk because nobody has ever been able to solve them.

1:09:47.600 --> 1:09:50.800
 How would you solve the Khabib Nurmagomedov puzzle?

1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:56.400
 Well, Khabib is very good against the fence.

1:09:56.400 --> 1:10:01.840
 I would have to establish a game plan and everything, but I think what I would need

1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:05.680
 it to do is take the center of the octagon right away.

1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:08.000
 Use a lot of think and faith.

1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:11.920
 Keep the fight all the way, all the way out or all the way in.

1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:16.120
 And when I say all the way in is when you close the gap, use my proactive and reactive

1:10:16.120 --> 1:10:20.280
 takedown and perhaps my superior explosive to put him down.

1:10:20.280 --> 1:10:25.320
 I like to use those proactive and reactive techniques because for me, I feel it's more

1:10:25.320 --> 1:10:26.320
 economical.

1:10:26.320 --> 1:10:30.440
 Khabib is a much better chain wrestler than me.

1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:34.080
 Chain wrestler is when you got that guy to the fence, it's pure wrestling.

1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:36.960
 What makes my takedown very efficient?

1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:37.960
 It's my karate.

1:10:37.960 --> 1:10:40.400
 It's not my wrestling.

1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:47.880
 I'm very good at timing my opponent and getting in with my explosivity.

1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:52.780
 So if you watch my takedown, it does not demand often, it does not demand a lot of work.

1:10:52.780 --> 1:10:56.200
 When I use the, I call it proactive takedown.

1:10:56.200 --> 1:11:03.280
 When he's coming to punch me and I react, I mean, proactive is when I'm faking it.

1:11:03.280 --> 1:11:08.700
 So I instigate the takedown by a fake, then I take him down.

1:11:08.700 --> 1:11:13.520
 And reactive is when I'm baiting him to throw something, then I'm going.

1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:14.520
 It's a counter.

1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:15.520
 Yeah.

1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:16.520
 Yes.

1:11:16.520 --> 1:11:17.520
 But all my takedowns...

1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:18.520
 In the center of the octagon.

1:11:18.520 --> 1:11:19.520
 Yes.

1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:20.520
 My takedowns are more in the center of the octagon.

1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:24.280
 Like for example, another guy that does it well is Gleason Thibault that did it well

1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:26.960
 in his best days.

1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:31.880
 Khabib has more a style of chain wrestling, I would say like Kamaru Usman, so to speak,

1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:32.880
 kind of guy.

1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:33.880
 It's a different style.

1:11:33.880 --> 1:11:36.640
 You cannot compare both styles.

1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:38.520
 And that's the kind of takedown I'm good.

1:11:38.520 --> 1:11:42.600
 And if I would have fight Khabib, that's one of the strategy I would have adopted.

1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:46.840
 I would not have been afraid because everybody that I fought, I was able to put them down

1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:52.520
 and I have the pedigree to prove it in my fight resume.

1:11:52.520 --> 1:11:56.600
 So you would have perhaps seen him on his back and I would have perhaps be on my back

1:11:56.600 --> 1:11:57.600
 as well.

1:11:57.600 --> 1:11:59.480
 So it would have been a very interesting fight.

1:11:59.480 --> 1:12:01.360
 How hard do you think he is to takedown?

1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:04.640
 I mean, a lot of people speak about his wrestling being just...

1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:07.320
 It has nothing to do with the wrestling because...

1:12:07.320 --> 1:12:08.320
 It has to do with the karate.

1:12:08.320 --> 1:12:13.320
 If I got that timing and I got my both hands around his knees, he's going down the other

1:12:13.320 --> 1:12:14.320
 way.

1:12:14.320 --> 1:12:15.320
 Everybody goes down.

1:12:15.320 --> 1:12:16.320
 Yes, yes, he goes down.

1:12:16.320 --> 1:12:18.520
 And I had a lot of that.

1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:19.520
 That's what I would have adopted.

1:12:19.520 --> 1:12:23.160
 I would not have been afraid of his wrestling.

1:12:23.160 --> 1:12:24.960
 I would have be the instigator.

1:12:24.960 --> 1:12:28.000
 I would have forced the fight forward.

1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:35.160
 And that's how I would have approached that fight, which I believe most of his opponent

1:12:35.160 --> 1:12:38.800
 were afraid of his wrestling because they didn't have the tools that I have to put him

1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:40.080
 down.

1:12:40.080 --> 1:12:41.760
 I would not have forced the wrestling.

1:12:41.760 --> 1:12:42.760
 I would have...

1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:44.720
 In the clinch, I would have tried to disengage.

1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:47.720
 I have many ways to disengage a clinch.

1:12:47.720 --> 1:12:54.840
 I would have wanted to force the fight in a fighting distance, like in a shoot box distance,

1:12:54.840 --> 1:12:57.440
 not in a wrestling distance.

1:12:57.440 --> 1:13:02.760
 Is it possible this fight still happens?

1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:06.720
 You're young, you look great in a suit.

1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:10.280
 Well, there's a lot of problems now.

1:13:10.280 --> 1:13:14.600
 And the thing is, now I made peace with it.

1:13:14.600 --> 1:13:17.480
 I no longer don't want to fight and I don't...

1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:18.480
 It's not going to happen.

1:13:18.480 --> 1:13:24.520
 UFC was not interested and I'm bound by contract with the UFC and by exclusivity.

1:13:24.520 --> 1:13:32.520
 Some people says to me, oh, how about if a wealthy Russian guy come with the money?

1:13:32.520 --> 1:13:37.200
 I said, I'm going to be in court with UFC.

1:13:37.200 --> 1:13:43.720
 And also, I'm older now and when I go home and I'm like, I don't want to do this, you

1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:44.720
 know?

1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:45.720
 But you were always like this.

1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:46.720
 No, I don't want to do this.

1:13:46.720 --> 1:13:50.560
 But like, for example, I was training with Freddie Roach a few days ago and I'm hitting

1:13:50.560 --> 1:13:53.280
 pads, you know?

1:13:53.280 --> 1:13:56.240
 And Freddie is looking at me and he's like, hey, you have the hitch back.

1:13:56.240 --> 1:13:57.240
 I'm like, yeah.

1:13:57.240 --> 1:14:03.800
 If Dana White would walk in the room, in the gym at that precise moment with the UFC contract,

1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:07.080
 I would sign it in the blink of an eye.

1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:15.920
 But when I go home, I'm like, hell no, my belly is full, I'm healthy, I'm wealthy.

1:14:15.920 --> 1:14:17.720
 Why would I want to fight for?

1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:19.080
 I made peace with it.

1:14:19.080 --> 1:14:22.920
 But the minute I go back in the gym, because I still get it inside me when I train with

1:14:22.920 --> 1:14:25.200
 the young guys, I still get it.

1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:29.360
 And a lot of guys think, hey, tell me the truth, you're preparing a comeback because

1:14:29.360 --> 1:14:30.360
 I still get it.

1:14:30.360 --> 1:14:36.440
 You know, I'm a little bit older, but I got more knowledge, I can compensate.

1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:40.760
 I become a different animal because, you know, it changed you.

1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:45.440
 But then after you go home and you're like, man, no way I'm doing this.

1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:51.640
 It's very hard to explain, you need to be a fighter to understand that it's very, very

1:14:51.640 --> 1:14:53.040
 hard to explain.

1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:59.200
 Well, from your perspective, I think Khabib is one of the rare, one of the few fascinating

1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:01.600
 scientific puzzles yet to be solved.

1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:06.160
 So from that aspect, as a martial artist, it's just a fascinating journey to try to

1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:07.160
 solve that puzzle.

1:15:07.160 --> 1:15:12.960
 There is a thing too, like we say, oh, who's the best fighter, people, Lex, they don't,

1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:18.680
 like I am this, I realized that later in my life and I'm sure a lot of young guy will

1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:24.040
 say, oh, I say, Pierre, it's not, don't speak for me, but I'm telling you right now what

1:15:24.040 --> 1:15:27.360
 I'm about to say, you will realize it later.

1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:33.520
 When I was young, I think you can proclaim yourself the more, the badass man on the planet,

1:15:33.520 --> 1:15:37.700
 you know, like nobody can beat you at, it's an illusion, man.

1:15:37.700 --> 1:15:43.800
 That's the sad thing about, for example, DC, Daniel Cormier does probably one of the greatest,

1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:49.880
 it's not the greatest of all time, you said Neotish, but like, it's almost because of

1:15:49.880 --> 1:15:55.160
 that little matchup with John Jones, it's difficult for people to conceive of him as

1:15:55.160 --> 1:15:56.480
 the greatest of all time.

1:15:56.480 --> 1:16:02.800
 It's all about matchup, it's all about timing, and also you make a fight, you make both guys

1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:11.840
 fight 10 times, the result might be different, like every time, you know, I mean, maybe he's

1:16:11.840 --> 1:16:17.440
 gonna win eight out of 10, but that night, he's gonna lose, why?

1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:21.120
 Because we don't know, the universe made it like that, you know, maybe he got sick, maybe

1:16:21.120 --> 1:16:26.960
 he had the emotional issues, he didn't sleep well, and it makes him lose focus and he got

1:16:26.960 --> 1:16:32.900
 caught, you don't, we don't know, but that's the thing, people ask me, would you have done

1:16:32.900 --> 1:16:34.680
 it with Khabib, what would happen?

1:16:34.680 --> 1:16:39.180
 I don't know, maybe out of 10 times, I don't know, maybe as a fighter, I hope I would have

1:16:39.180 --> 1:16:45.520
 won more than him, he thinks the opposite is only one way to find out, but that night,

1:16:45.520 --> 1:16:49.320
 if there is a fight, the guy that's gonna win doesn't mean he's the best fighter, that's

1:16:49.320 --> 1:16:55.360
 mean that he's the one that fought the best the night of the fight, same thing in basketball

1:16:55.360 --> 1:17:01.360
 or hockey, the team that wins the game, it's not necessarily the best team, it's the team

1:17:01.360 --> 1:17:07.440
 that played the best the night of the game, and fighting is no different, so being the

1:17:07.440 --> 1:17:11.920
 baddest man on the planet, it's an illusion.

1:17:11.920 --> 1:17:17.000
 I mean that's the tragic thing about it, is on any one night, anything can happen and

1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:24.200
 then that tells a story for all of human history, it's sad to think about, but that's what makes

1:17:24.200 --> 1:17:30.400
 it beautiful, that there's so much at stake, like entire lives, all the dreams you've had

1:17:30.400 --> 1:17:34.820
 growing up, all the hard work, all of it is decided in a single night, even though that

1:17:34.820 --> 1:17:41.080
 means nothing in terms of who's actually better, I mean that's the beauty, that's why people

1:17:41.080 --> 1:17:48.520
 love the Olympics especially, because it happens so rarely, and dreams are broken, or like

1:17:48.520 --> 1:17:55.800
 triumph is achieved by the unlikely hero, all like right there, I mean that's why we

1:17:55.800 --> 1:17:58.760
 love it, right, that's why we love it.

1:17:58.760 --> 1:18:02.960
 If we wouldn't know always the result before, it would be boring, that's why we do it, you

1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:12.160
 know, watch the odds, like sometimes I like to watch the odds before a fight, you know,

1:18:12.160 --> 1:18:20.160
 because there's things, I believe in causality, everybody believes different things, but I

1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:26.400
 believe everything is because there's a cause to everything, that's personally what I believe,

1:18:26.400 --> 1:18:31.480
 I don't believe that I have like free will, I think I have the illusion of free will,

1:18:31.480 --> 1:18:37.040
 but I believe there's a cause for everything, and if I'm doing something because of something,

1:18:37.040 --> 1:18:41.520
 because of a cause, by definition, there's no free will in a way, if there's a cause,

1:18:41.520 --> 1:18:43.920
 by definition, there's not.

1:18:43.920 --> 1:18:49.000
 How does that make you feel by the way, like the idea that if we just look outside of even

1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:53.120
 just human psychology and fighting and so on, if we look at like physics, if everything

1:18:53.120 --> 1:18:58.960
 is predetermined, if all of these little molecules interacting, it's all already, like your story

1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:00.280
 is already written.

1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:06.080
 I mean, it depends, it's written, but I wouldn't need to know all the data and it's impossible,

1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:07.080
 right?

1:19:07.080 --> 1:19:15.800
 Like it's kind of weird, I gotta say, but to me, I don't see any argument to counter

1:19:15.800 --> 1:19:24.160
 that idea, maybe I'm ignorant, but I haven't seen nobody and everything that I've read

1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:31.280
 so far, there's nothing that counter that idea, because in a mechanical world, if your

1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:39.880
 car broke, or we don't say, oh, the car decided to broke, or a tree is fall, there's reason

1:19:39.880 --> 1:19:43.440
 why the tree is fall, we don't say the tree is decide to fall, right?

1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:49.080
 So because us human being, I think it's our ego, we decide, and I'm no different than

1:19:49.080 --> 1:19:56.240
 anybody when I make a decision, I decided to do this, I choose to do this, but I'm aware

1:19:56.240 --> 1:20:04.720
 that there is causes that make me do certain things, and by definition, I think if there

1:20:04.720 --> 1:20:09.160
 is a cause, there is no free will, by definition, right?

1:20:09.160 --> 1:20:15.040
 Yes, but the thing is, just like you said, we understand so little about human intelligence,

1:20:15.040 --> 1:20:25.320
 the human mind, and especially consciousness, that this giant mystery, this darkness, that

1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:33.160
 we don't understand how it feels like to be something, to be a conscious being, that because

1:20:33.160 --> 1:20:39.000
 of that, we're not able to really even reason about free will, or not, because there might

1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:46.880
 be some magic that comes from consciousness, the consciousness might be the thing that

1:20:46.880 --> 1:20:49.880
 makes us different from a car that breaks down.

1:20:49.880 --> 1:20:58.040
 There might be something totally fascinating, totally undiscovered yet, that will make us

1:20:58.040 --> 1:21:03.160
 realize that free will is actually real, and is somehow fundamental to the human experience.

1:21:03.160 --> 1:21:11.940
 So it's, sometimes I think we forget when we talk about free will and physics and it

1:21:11.940 --> 1:21:16.840
 all seeming to be predetermined, we forget how little we actually understand about the

1:21:16.840 --> 1:21:23.360
 world, and I think in that mystery, there could be totally new ideas that are yet to

1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:29.560
 be discovered, and will make us realize that it's not just an illusion, it is something

1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:33.680
 that is like at the core of how the universe works.

1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:39.880
 Some people believe that consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe, like

1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:46.440
 it's one of the forces of physics, like consciousness permeates everything, it's in everything.

1:21:46.440 --> 1:21:51.300
 Like this table is conscious, but it's not as conscious as us, and we're this little

1:21:51.300 --> 1:21:56.600
 peak of consciousness, and if that's true, and if we get to understand that, maybe there's

1:21:56.600 --> 1:22:03.400
 something, there's an extra bonus we get in terms of free will once you become one of

1:22:03.400 --> 1:22:05.840
 those entities that are super conscious.

1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:10.760
 So I tend to be sort of humbled by the mystery of it.

1:22:10.760 --> 1:22:20.960
 Do you believe one day with the technology that keep improving, we will make robot that

1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:25.800
 will be able to be somehow conscious?

1:22:25.800 --> 1:22:31.720
 Absolutely, that's been my dream, that's been, I hope to do just that.

1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:37.860
 First of all, I believe that all people are capable and want to be good to each other,

1:22:37.860 --> 1:22:45.080
 and I think love is a really powerful thing that connects us and can create better and

1:22:45.080 --> 1:22:52.760
 better worlds, sort of like create better and better societies that improve both the

1:22:52.760 --> 1:22:57.080
 technology, the quality of life, and just the basics of human experience.

1:22:57.080 --> 1:23:04.200
 And I think creating AI systems that are conscious, that are human like, can enable us to be better

1:23:04.200 --> 1:23:05.400
 to each other.

1:23:05.400 --> 1:23:12.300
 Like they can, it's almost like adding more and more kindness to the world through the

1:23:12.300 --> 1:23:16.580
 systems we interact with will inspire us to be better and better to each other.

1:23:16.580 --> 1:23:23.620
 In terms of them being conscious, I think that is an absolute requirement that entities

1:23:23.620 --> 1:23:30.280
 we interact with communicate some element of consciousness to us, like that's how we

1:23:30.280 --> 1:23:31.600
 connect to each other.

1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:37.800
 The reason we, you and I connect is that we believe that each of us are conscious.

1:23:37.800 --> 1:23:44.760
 And to me, what consciousness means is the ability to hurt, the ability to suffer, to

1:23:44.760 --> 1:23:51.720
 struggle in this world, because just like you said, without the struggle, you don't

1:23:51.720 --> 1:23:57.200
 have the love, you don't have the pleasure, and ultimately consciousness is an entity's

1:23:57.200 --> 1:24:03.860
 ability to struggle, to suffer, and from that arises the pleasure.

1:24:03.860 --> 1:24:17.320
 And us together being able to appreciate the highs and experience together the lows, that's

1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:19.400
 how we form the deep connections.

1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:24.000
 I personally think we can create that in robots, and I personally believe it's a lot easier

1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:26.160
 than we think.

1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:35.080
 Does it make you afraid sometimes about the fact that one day AI, like artificial intelligence

1:24:35.080 --> 1:24:40.760
 could hurt us?

1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:45.600
 Because of Hollywood, of course, the movies we watch, but it seems like when I hear sometimes

1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:48.160
 Elon Musk talking, you know?

1:24:48.160 --> 1:24:53.480
 Yeah, so Elon talks about with AI, we're summoning the demon.

1:24:53.480 --> 1:24:58.360
 He is very concerned, and I talked to him about it quite a bit, he's very concerned

1:24:58.360 --> 1:25:03.240
 about all the different ways AI could hurt us humans.

1:25:03.240 --> 1:25:08.480
 I tend to believe that there's a lot more ways in which AI can make our lives better

1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:11.200
 and can make life awesome for humans.

1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:16.280
 I think humans are the ones that can do a lot of evil things.

1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:20.200
 So I'm less worried about AI, I'm more worried about humans.

1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:28.720
 If I look at what humans have done on the course of history, for example, in regards

1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:36.000
 to the planet to the scale of the universe, I think what I'm afraid is that we have more

1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:41.060
 of a destructive force than a beneficial force.

1:25:41.060 --> 1:25:49.600
 So if AI take that in consideration in order to protect us against ourselves, it could

1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:50.600
 hurt us in a way.

1:25:50.600 --> 1:25:54.400
 I don't know if you understand, what do you think about that?

1:25:54.400 --> 1:26:00.840
 Does it makes you afraid sometimes, not because of AI, but because of what humans are doing

1:26:00.840 --> 1:26:06.880
 that AI could do to us to prevent us of hurting ourselves, you know?

1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:15.000
 Yeah, I mean, definitely it can bring out the worst in human nature and provide tools

1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:19.200
 for evil people to do evil things at a larger scale.

1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:24.280
 But I just think it depends what you think human beings are.

1:26:24.280 --> 1:26:34.040
 I tend to believe that as we get more intelligent, we start to see the value, the evolutionary

1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:38.080
 value and the value in terms of happiness of being good to each other.

1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:43.240
 And I think AI, if you look at AI as an optimization problem of how to create a civilization that

1:26:43.240 --> 1:26:50.080
 works well and expands throughout the universe, I think love is much more effective.

1:26:50.080 --> 1:26:53.360
 So AI will help us maximize that.

1:26:53.360 --> 1:26:58.480
 I think there's going to be always spikes throughout, as it has been through human history,

1:26:58.480 --> 1:27:03.960
 where charismatic leaders will do evil onto the world in the name of good.

1:27:03.960 --> 1:27:07.520
 You have the Stalin and the Hitlers and all of that.

1:27:07.520 --> 1:27:19.000
 But ultimately over time, I think technology will give the good people power and the evil

1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.960
 people less power.

1:27:21.960 --> 1:27:26.960
 Now there's a lot of ways that that won't be the case.

1:27:26.960 --> 1:27:32.240
 There's a lot of ways for it to go wrong and Elon talks about them, but I honestly think

1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:37.560
 in terms of intelligent AI, that's going to bring more love to the world.

1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:40.880
 The thing I'm concerned about is dumb AI.

1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:45.720
 So there's been a lot of discussion between China and the United States recently on autonomous

1:27:45.720 --> 1:27:47.360
 weapons system.

1:27:47.360 --> 1:27:56.200
 This is something people don't, they're afraid to talk about, but there's now a race where

1:27:56.200 --> 1:28:02.640
 the United States has officially said that they're not against adding AI to its weapon

1:28:02.640 --> 1:28:03.640
 systems.

1:28:03.640 --> 1:28:14.000
 So now the US military is adding automation, adding intelligence to its drones, to anything

1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.000
 that can create damage.

1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:21.240
 And so of course, and they did this so in response to China doing that.

1:28:21.240 --> 1:28:24.560
 So you can imagine this is Terminator.

1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:30.360
 You think about Terminators and intelligent systems, they're not, they're pretty dumb.

1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:34.480
 The point is they're efficient at doing what they do.

1:28:34.480 --> 1:28:39.640
 And in the space of war, efficient at doing what you do means killing.

1:28:39.640 --> 1:28:43.120
 So that I'm really afraid of, but those are dumb AI.

1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:49.060
 Those aren't your loving, deep, fulfilling relationships.

1:28:49.060 --> 1:28:55.880
 That's like efficiently being able to fly, to plan the trajectory of dropping bombs,

1:28:55.880 --> 1:29:01.540
 of missiles, of how to do counter attacks, of how to maximize the destruction of a particular

1:29:01.540 --> 1:29:04.040
 facility instead of individuals.

1:29:04.040 --> 1:29:07.440
 And then that can just escalate.

1:29:07.440 --> 1:29:12.480
 And as opposed to the cold war with the Soviet Union, this could be a hot war.

1:29:12.480 --> 1:29:19.860
 And then the consequences, once you allow, it's kind of terrifying because currently

1:29:19.860 --> 1:29:22.040
 the drones are operated by humans.

1:29:22.040 --> 1:29:30.040
 So you have say, you have information about, intelligence gives you information about a

1:29:30.040 --> 1:29:33.160
 particular terrorist located in this area.

1:29:33.160 --> 1:29:40.060
 And then you use drones to maybe the automation there is to help you figure out what is the

1:29:40.060 --> 1:29:44.320
 best trajectory to strike at that location.

1:29:44.320 --> 1:29:49.840
 So you still have a human that pulls the trigger at the end and dropping the bomb.

1:29:49.840 --> 1:29:56.640
 Now automation and AI and autonomous weapons systems might be where you say, there's a

1:29:56.640 --> 1:29:58.840
 bad guy over here.

1:29:58.840 --> 1:30:02.440
 You figure out how to get rid of the bad guy.

1:30:02.440 --> 1:30:06.560
 So then of course the systems will be very good at finding the right trajectory and so

1:30:06.560 --> 1:30:11.280
 on, but there's bugs that can happen.

1:30:11.280 --> 1:30:16.880
 Unexpected bugs that the system might figure out that there is this bad guy might actually

1:30:16.880 --> 1:30:20.140
 be in these other five locations.

1:30:20.140 --> 1:30:24.980
 So might make sense to cover the entire area, right?

1:30:24.980 --> 1:30:31.180
 And so you might drop bombs on the entire area and then that's just okay.

1:30:31.180 --> 1:30:35.600
 So that's going to lead to a lot of destruction at the scale of a city, but then you can immediately

1:30:35.600 --> 1:30:37.620
 take that to nuclear weapons.

1:30:37.620 --> 1:30:43.960
 If you add automation to responding to counterattacks to nuclear weapons, somebody, you might get

1:30:43.960 --> 1:30:48.320
 information that somebody is planning a nuclear attack on the United States and the AI system

1:30:48.320 --> 1:30:53.560
 will immediately respond and you know, it can respond at a scale of launching nuclear

1:30:53.560 --> 1:30:54.560
 weapons itself.

1:30:54.560 --> 1:30:59.520
 And so there's all of these possibilities that don't require much intelligence.

1:30:59.520 --> 1:31:04.320
 And that's exceptionally concerning.

1:31:04.320 --> 1:31:09.200
 I'm like you, I do not believe there is babies that are born bad.

1:31:09.200 --> 1:31:14.880
 I think people do bad things because of their experience.

1:31:14.880 --> 1:31:23.360
 However, if I look through my experience and from what I can see is some very often, man's

1:31:23.360 --> 1:31:29.440
 of power wants more power.

1:31:29.440 --> 1:31:32.080
 That's what makes me afraid with, you know?

1:31:32.080 --> 1:31:37.520
 Absolutely, listen, I've come from the Soviet Union.

1:31:37.520 --> 1:31:41.280
 Stalin is arguably one of the most powerful humans in history.

1:31:41.280 --> 1:31:44.160
 He's not talked often enough about by the evils he's done.

1:31:44.160 --> 1:31:49.680
 Hitler gets all the attention, but Stalin has done arguably much more evil than Hitler.

1:31:49.680 --> 1:31:52.280
 Yeah, well, this is human nature.

1:31:52.280 --> 1:31:53.960
 It wants power.

1:31:53.960 --> 1:31:57.320
 We see that with institutions, we see that with governments and nations.

1:31:57.320 --> 1:32:04.680
 I think you see this with the internet, people are really hungry for the distribution of

1:32:04.680 --> 1:32:05.680
 power.

1:32:05.680 --> 1:32:11.680
 Like you see that people are very much distrustful of centralized places of power, of institutions

1:32:11.680 --> 1:32:12.760
 and so on.

1:32:12.760 --> 1:32:19.280
 So I think successful organizations, successful companies, successful governments will be

1:32:19.280 --> 1:32:22.240
 run by people who distribute the power.

1:32:22.240 --> 1:32:24.880
 Like I don't trust myself with power at all.

1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:32.000
 And I think you have to build into the system that no one person can have power and that

1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:33.000
 you distribute it.

1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:37.040
 That's where you have in the financial sector, you have cryptocurrency right now with Bitcoin

1:32:37.040 --> 1:32:38.600
 and all those kinds of things.

1:32:38.600 --> 1:32:44.500
 People are exploring, how can we avoid the central bank to have the control?

1:32:44.500 --> 1:32:49.440
 How do you put the power in the hands of people, thousands of people, millions of people?

1:32:49.440 --> 1:32:58.960
 And same way with military, with any kind of, with technology, I think the future looks

1:32:58.960 --> 1:33:01.040
 very distributed.

1:33:01.040 --> 1:33:05.760
 What do you think about militarizing space?

1:33:05.760 --> 1:33:12.400
 The space force, I don't think about it often because right now I'm filled with excitement

1:33:12.400 --> 1:33:15.760
 about space exploration, which is the positive aspect.

1:33:15.760 --> 1:33:22.040
 So Elon, I was born in an era where it was exciting.

1:33:22.040 --> 1:33:28.400
 I don't know about you, but for me it's exciting to look up to the stars and dream about us

1:33:28.400 --> 1:33:35.480
 humans colonizing Mars, colonizing other planets, expanding out to the galaxy, into the universe.

1:33:35.480 --> 1:33:38.180
 That's really exciting.

1:33:38.180 --> 1:33:43.320
 So the possibilities there are endless.

1:33:43.320 --> 1:33:47.580
 I don't think, because also the resources are endless.

1:33:47.580 --> 1:33:55.040
 And so I think we get into trouble with militarization, with wars when the resources are very constrained.

1:33:55.040 --> 1:34:01.420
 So I think for a while we're not going to be fighting, the only wars we'll be fighting

1:34:01.420 --> 1:34:05.440
 in space are the ones that kind of help us.

1:34:05.440 --> 1:34:10.400
 Another nation to compete, who goes to the moon first, I guess.

1:34:10.400 --> 1:34:15.440
 Those kinds of things are maybe for satellites and all those kinds of communication and maybe

1:34:15.440 --> 1:34:19.160
 in assistance for cyber warfare, which is also very dangerous.

1:34:19.160 --> 1:34:28.400
 But in terms of the wars out in space, I think everything out in space will be positive and

1:34:28.400 --> 1:34:29.400
 inspiring.

1:34:29.400 --> 1:34:33.580
 It's very hard, but all good things are hard, I think.

1:34:33.580 --> 1:34:38.880
 This is where I've been talking to a bunch of people about extraterrestrial life.

1:34:38.880 --> 1:34:45.320
 I'm really excited by, I don't know, it's the other thing.

1:34:45.320 --> 1:34:48.220
 When I look out to the stars, it's exciting to me.

1:34:48.220 --> 1:34:53.180
 I know I think you've spoken about it being scary, but to me it's exciting that there's

1:34:53.180 --> 1:34:59.560
 intelligent creatures out there far beyond perhaps the intelligence of our own that are

1:34:59.560 --> 1:35:04.780
 just too far away to explore yet, but we might one day come in contact with them.

1:35:04.780 --> 1:35:11.440
 So that to me is the ultimate motivator is to meet other intelligence life forms out

1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:13.040
 there and connect with them.

1:35:13.040 --> 1:35:15.400
 Have you ever meet Jacques Vallée?

1:35:15.400 --> 1:35:17.640
 No, but I've been in communication.

1:35:17.640 --> 1:35:19.280
 I want to, I hope to talk to him.

1:35:19.280 --> 1:35:20.280
 He's an amazing...

1:35:20.280 --> 1:35:21.280
 French, yeah.

1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:27.720
 I know that there's many theories about, you know, if there's alien, we don't know, right?

1:35:27.720 --> 1:35:34.120
 But some people think it's from another star systems and Jacques Vallée has like to make

1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:43.080
 a long story short, he has a different theory, thinks it's perhaps beings that could be living

1:35:43.080 --> 1:35:44.960
 in a different dimension than us.

1:35:44.960 --> 1:35:49.700
 And the reason why he says that is when he makes an experiment, when there is a sightings

1:35:49.700 --> 1:35:58.980
 very often of a UFO, let's say I'm the UFO that you have three guys, they are looking

1:35:58.980 --> 1:36:06.240
 at the UFO very often, one experiment that you can do, and sometimes that is the case,

1:36:06.240 --> 1:36:11.040
 you ask your two friends to walk on the side and there's a point that it's like a corridor,

1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:14.640
 you see the UFO and then you stop seeing it like a corridor.

1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:20.000
 And that's one of the reasons why he's saying that it's perhaps dimension.

1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:23.280
 And I found that fascinating, you know?

1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:27.480
 This is what, you know, to the discussion of consciousness and all that, it feels like

1:36:27.480 --> 1:36:33.000
 we might be just experiencing a very particular slice of this universe, we might not be understanding

1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:37.980
 what's at the higher dimensions or, yeah, I mean, higher dimensions in whatever form

1:36:37.980 --> 1:36:44.080
 that means, you know, there's all these physical theories now that describe a world with dimensions

1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:47.800
 that's much higher than the four dimensions of the three dimension of space and the one

1:36:47.800 --> 1:36:49.800
 dimension of time.

1:36:49.800 --> 1:36:56.840
 So whatever the hell is going on in those other dimensions, it could be something, unfortunately,

1:36:56.840 --> 1:37:02.240
 this is the sad part, it might be something we can't even comprehend with our human brains,

1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:09.120
 that the limitations are just, I mean, we're just descendants of apes, so like it might

1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:10.840
 not be possible to even understand.

1:37:10.840 --> 1:37:11.840
 Is there alien?

1:37:11.840 --> 1:37:12.840
 Is there another dimension?

1:37:12.840 --> 1:37:14.720
 Are they human from the future?

1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:19.880
 Is there perhaps Chinese or another, you know what I mean, a group of people that are working

1:37:19.880 --> 1:37:21.960
 with technology far behind?

1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:26.880
 But you know what, Lex, I had the chance to meet, you know, because of the sport I'm doing,

1:37:26.880 --> 1:37:34.040
 I met a lot of people in military and politics sometimes that I ask them every time.

1:37:34.040 --> 1:37:42.320
 I met one this week and I asked him, I say, is it true about the UFOs there?

1:37:42.320 --> 1:37:47.600
 And he says to me, he's like, even before I asked him, I say, sorry, I have to ask you

1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:48.600
 a question.

1:37:48.600 --> 1:37:52.960
 I was in Los Angeles and I said, sorry, I have to ask you a question.

1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:55.400
 He said, oh, you want to ask me about UFOs right away, you do.

1:37:55.400 --> 1:37:56.400
 And I say, yes.

1:37:56.400 --> 1:37:57.400
 He saw it in your eyes.

1:37:57.400 --> 1:38:00.440
 He said, yeah, there is things that flies that we don't know.

1:38:00.440 --> 1:38:04.360
 But he didn't tell me, he doesn't know it, they don't know if it's alien or whatever,

1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:07.240
 but there's things apparently that are detected.

1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:11.200
 And I know you met Fravor, you know, like Fravor is fascinating.

1:38:11.200 --> 1:38:12.200
 It's crazy.

1:38:12.200 --> 1:38:17.840
 It makes me sad that we live in a different era now that it used to be a subject that

1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:23.840
 was ridicules and now it's so cool that it's, you know, I'm very excited to live in to that

1:38:23.840 --> 1:38:25.320
 era, you know?

1:38:25.320 --> 1:38:29.560
 Yeah, it's really exciting, but still the governments are kind of behind the times on

1:38:29.560 --> 1:38:35.160
 that aspect is they're not transparent and they don't communicate well.

1:38:35.160 --> 1:38:40.640
 You know, it saddens me to think the possibility that, that, you know, like the US government

1:38:40.640 --> 1:38:46.560
 might be in possession of something that they don't tell the world about because they're

1:38:46.560 --> 1:38:51.480
 just scared is because they don't know what the hell it is and they don't want the Chinese

1:38:51.480 --> 1:38:54.600
 to gain the technology or all those kinds of things.

1:38:54.600 --> 1:38:58.800
 Do you think the president of the United States, for example, because the president comes and

1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:04.480
 go every, right, four or eight years, do you think he would know all the secret or it would

1:39:04.480 --> 1:39:09.720
 be a guy like, for example, Vladimir Putin would know much of, you know what I mean?

1:39:09.720 --> 1:39:14.800
 I don't think the president even know, like even knows all the secret.

1:39:14.800 --> 1:39:15.800
 The US president.

1:39:15.800 --> 1:39:20.720
 I don't think so because he goes, they go back and forth, you know, every four years,

1:39:20.720 --> 1:39:22.980
 you know, they have the terms, right?

1:39:22.980 --> 1:39:29.680
 So I, you know, I wasn't sure before, but I think I could trust the previous United

1:39:29.680 --> 1:39:36.640
 States president of Donald Trump that if he knew, he would probably tweet about it.

1:39:36.640 --> 1:39:45.680
 So I think from the, you know, I've worked with DARPA, I worked with DOD at a clearance

1:39:45.680 --> 1:39:51.600
 and I think from the perspective, if you, if you see the world as fundamentally a dangerous

1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:58.360
 world where secrets are important to have from a military perspective, I think it's

1:39:58.360 --> 1:40:06.000
 very unsafe to tell the president of the United States that you have this kind of technology.

1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:11.120
 So if you think of the world in that way, I hate that that's how that world is viewed

1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:16.040
 because ultimately I think what's more powerful than the military secrets, and I hope that

1:40:16.040 --> 1:40:23.520
 actually is what will happen in the 21st century, is what's more powerful is inspire people.

1:40:23.520 --> 1:40:29.100
 Inspire the young Elon Musk's of the world to create cool new things.

1:40:29.100 --> 1:40:35.800
 If we have technology that we've have come, have encountered that we don't understand

1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:40.720
 that should only be inspiration to develop that kind of stuff.

1:40:40.720 --> 1:40:46.700
 It shouldn't be seen as military, as a military threat, as a secret to hold on to.

1:40:46.700 --> 1:40:53.720
 I think secrets, I hope we more and more let go of the idea that there are secrets that

1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:59.720
 give us advantage, you know, like in the tech sector, people are more and more releasing

1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:03.240
 the software and making it open source.

1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:05.400
 Like secrets don't make sense.

1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:07.280
 They share the knowledge, right?

1:41:07.280 --> 1:41:08.280
 Share the knowledge.

1:41:08.280 --> 1:41:13.200
 Like being afraid to share the knowledge, I think, I hope is an old idea.

1:41:13.200 --> 1:41:14.200
 It's more, yeah.

1:41:14.200 --> 1:41:16.880
 When you make it, things more compartmentalize, you know?

1:41:16.880 --> 1:41:17.880
 Yes.

1:41:17.880 --> 1:41:18.880
 Well, yeah.

1:41:18.880 --> 1:41:23.460
 That's the other thing is the bureaucracy of government is like people only know their

1:41:23.460 --> 1:41:25.800
 own little thing and they don't spread the information.

1:41:25.800 --> 1:41:26.800
 It doesn't travel well.

1:41:26.800 --> 1:41:30.320
 I mean, there's a lot of just inefficiencies that are, it makes me sad.

1:41:30.320 --> 1:41:37.280
 It makes me sad because the science, the engineering that happens in governments, like Lockheed

1:41:37.280 --> 1:41:42.360
 Martin developing the different airplanes that they use for military applications is

1:41:42.360 --> 1:41:45.000
 some of the most incredible engineering ever.

1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:49.640
 And it's secret because they're afraid to share it with the Russians and the Chinese

1:41:49.640 --> 1:41:51.520
 and so on.

1:41:51.520 --> 1:41:58.240
 But on that topic, I do think somebody like Vladimir Putin probably knows some stuff.

1:41:58.240 --> 1:41:59.240
 My God.

1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:00.240
 My God.

1:42:00.240 --> 1:42:01.980
 I would love to know what he knows.

1:42:01.980 --> 1:42:06.400
 But then again, you never know because even he is, you know, people think of him as an

1:42:06.400 --> 1:42:12.460
 exceptionally powerful person, but he's also just managing a bunch of tribes.

1:42:12.460 --> 1:42:14.320
 His power is very limited.

1:42:14.320 --> 1:42:21.480
 He's trying to hold together a bunch of greedy, power hungry, mad men.

1:42:21.480 --> 1:42:22.480
 That's right.

1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:23.480
 Okay.

1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:24.580
 And he's trying to establish a balance.

1:42:24.580 --> 1:42:26.060
 He might not know everything.

1:42:26.060 --> 1:42:31.800
 So I hope this changes because I think there's nothing more exciting about.

1:42:31.800 --> 1:42:35.440
 I don't even know if there is a human that knows.

1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:36.440
 You know what I mean?

1:42:36.440 --> 1:42:42.180
 Like this idea that there is some civilization, alien civilization that that land on the White

1:42:42.180 --> 1:42:44.200
 House and say, hi, I come to meet the president.

1:42:44.200 --> 1:42:46.360
 And like, why would they do that?

1:42:46.360 --> 1:42:47.360
 You know what I mean?

1:42:47.360 --> 1:42:48.920
 It's kind of absurd.

1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:49.920
 You know?

1:42:49.920 --> 1:42:56.480
 Well, I do think that actually, I mean, that's one possibility, right, is LART, you know,

1:42:56.480 --> 1:43:01.520
 if an alien civilization really wanted to contact us, I think everybody would know.

1:43:01.520 --> 1:43:08.240
 So I think what we're, if there's any kind of interaction between humans and aliens,

1:43:08.240 --> 1:43:15.320
 I think most likely what we're interacting with is a crappy like probe drone thing that

1:43:15.320 --> 1:43:22.140
 kind of just like, like, it's like this, this dumb thing, you know, we're not interacting

1:43:22.140 --> 1:43:23.140
 with the aliens.

1:43:23.140 --> 1:43:32.120
 I think just like, just like for us, I think humans aren't when we venture out into space.

1:43:32.120 --> 1:43:35.360
 The first thing that's going to meet aliens is our robots.

1:43:35.360 --> 1:43:38.860
 It's not us humans because we keep sending robots out.

1:43:38.860 --> 1:43:43.560
 So they're going to like, they're going to make decisions about humans by looking at

1:43:43.560 --> 1:43:44.560
 the robots.

1:43:44.560 --> 1:43:49.920
 I say the famous grays, the grays, maybe they are robots.

1:43:49.920 --> 1:43:51.480
 Maybe it's all BS too, you know?

1:43:51.480 --> 1:43:52.480
 Yeah.

1:43:52.480 --> 1:43:58.080
 I don't know, I don't know what that interaction actually would look like if aliens really

1:43:58.080 --> 1:44:00.280
 wanted to reach out, really communicate.

1:44:00.280 --> 1:44:02.640
 And I don't know if we're able to actually communicate with them.

1:44:02.640 --> 1:44:03.640
 That's one of the sad things.

1:44:03.640 --> 1:44:09.600
 We may not be able to, that we might, the aliens might already be here and we might

1:44:09.600 --> 1:44:16.040
 just not even know, know how to see them or know how to communicate with them.

1:44:16.040 --> 1:44:24.600
 There's so much misinformation and sometimes there is peoples that are very credible that,

1:44:24.600 --> 1:44:29.240
 that made crazy claims, you know, like, you don't know what to believe, you know, like,

1:44:29.240 --> 1:44:36.420
 like Paul Aylor, the minister of defense of Canada said like some, that there is many

1:44:36.420 --> 1:44:43.560
 alien rays that ever, that's what he said, research it and that scientists from, I think

1:44:43.560 --> 1:44:49.760
 Israel recently have said something about Trump, he was keeping secret or Medvedev,

1:44:49.760 --> 1:44:54.480
 you're from Russia, Medvedev have been caught in a, like during a break in between interviews

1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:57.240
 to talks about like, oh, it's like men in black, so to speak.

1:44:57.240 --> 1:44:58.240
 I don't know.

1:44:58.240 --> 1:45:01.400
 He didn't look like he was joking, but I don't know if he was saying the truth.

1:45:01.400 --> 1:45:02.400
 I didn't know about this.

1:45:02.400 --> 1:45:03.400
 Yeah, you can check on YouTube.

1:45:03.400 --> 1:45:05.560
 It's a, it's, it's, it went, it went viral.

1:45:05.560 --> 1:45:06.560
 Yeah.

1:45:06.560 --> 1:45:11.880
 There's a lot of things like that sometimes I'm like, or, or Bob Lazar, I'm like, imagine

1:45:11.880 --> 1:45:13.880
 if it's true, man.

1:45:13.880 --> 1:45:14.880
 Yeah.

1:45:14.880 --> 1:45:19.920
 Imagine if we're like a fish in the water, we live in our own world and sometimes there's

1:45:19.920 --> 1:45:25.320
 a fisherman that grabbed the fish, take him out of the water and threw it back in the

1:45:25.320 --> 1:45:30.000
 water and the fish goes back to the other fish and say, Hey, there's someone that, that

1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:31.000
 take me out of the water.

1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:33.880
 Then I've seen things that I did not like.

1:45:33.880 --> 1:45:34.880
 Imagine if it's true.

1:45:34.880 --> 1:45:36.840
 Like we like, yeah.

1:45:36.840 --> 1:45:42.600
 And one other thing, like I wanted to ask you because you were consciousness, how about

1:45:42.600 --> 1:45:43.600
 dreams?

1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:44.600
 What is a dream?

1:45:44.600 --> 1:45:45.600
 Yeah.

1:45:45.600 --> 1:45:48.360
 Well, I, I, I more and more, I don't know if you're paying attention to this.

1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:52.400
 There's no, it's become more acceptable in the scientific community to do large scale

1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:56.500
 studies of psychedelics, for example, and there's a lot of connection between psychedelics

1:45:56.500 --> 1:45:57.500
 and dreams.

1:45:57.500 --> 1:45:59.120
 There's very similar states.

1:45:59.120 --> 1:46:04.120
 There's, there's a lot our mind does when it detaches itself from reality that it can

1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:05.880
 just explore a lot of different ideas.

1:46:05.880 --> 1:46:10.840
 It's very possible that dreams is you're traveling somewhere and the same thing with psychedelics.

1:46:10.840 --> 1:46:15.640
 You're traveling somewhere in a different, not traveling to physical space.

1:46:15.640 --> 1:46:17.640
 It's the other dimensions that we're talking about.

1:46:17.640 --> 1:46:22.400
 You're traveling some other through some other dimension to meet some other creature.

1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:24.520
 People talk with DMT that they meet some elves.

1:46:24.520 --> 1:46:31.480
 I've never done, I I'd like to, I don't know if there's a safe legal way to do it, but

1:46:31.480 --> 1:46:39.480
 they all talk about meeting elves and creatures like entities and like, who are they?

1:46:39.480 --> 1:46:42.040
 What's what is this?

1:46:42.040 --> 1:46:46.480
 Is it because they're high or it's because they're actually meeting something and maybe

1:46:46.480 --> 1:46:47.480
 there's no difference.

1:46:47.480 --> 1:46:52.000
 I mean that who knows exactly and that's takes us right back to us not being able to really

1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:54.480
 understand how our mind works.

1:46:54.480 --> 1:46:58.240
 You know, I work in artificial intelligence.

1:46:58.240 --> 1:47:04.280
 It's clear that we understand so little about intelligence, some basic things about intelligence

1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:09.740
 just at the, at the very sort of basic first principles level.

1:47:09.740 --> 1:47:17.500
 We don't understand what it means to, to reason, to think, to assimilate pieces of knowledge

1:47:17.500 --> 1:47:21.740
 together from the, from the basics to the complex.

1:47:21.740 --> 1:47:22.740
 We don't understand it.

1:47:22.740 --> 1:47:25.200
 We don't understand how the human mind does it.

1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:30.600
 We don't understand how the human mind is able to take incredible waterfall of information

1:47:30.600 --> 1:47:34.420
 and filter cleanly into just like clean.

1:47:34.420 --> 1:47:37.960
 You only see the things that are important and are able to stitch them together and be

1:47:37.960 --> 1:47:40.280
 able to reason about the world.

1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:44.800
 And at the same time have moments of like genius of creativity.

1:47:44.800 --> 1:47:46.320
 Like what is that?

1:47:46.320 --> 1:47:50.480
 That also, you know, people, writers talk about that, that they're, you know, they're

1:47:50.480 --> 1:47:54.160
 almost like communicating with a muse, like where do ideas come from?

1:47:54.160 --> 1:47:56.000
 This is the Joe Rogan philosophy.

1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:01.920
 But I do know that past civilization where a lot of them were based on shamanism.

1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:02.920
 And you know what?

1:48:02.920 --> 1:48:10.220
 I think it's sad is if someone drink alcohol and when he's drunk, he's going to commit

1:48:10.220 --> 1:48:13.360
 like create like, like murders or something.

1:48:13.360 --> 1:48:14.360
 We're going to blame the person.

1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:15.360
 Right?

1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:16.360
 You're going to say that's his fault.

1:48:16.360 --> 1:48:17.960
 It's not the fault of alcohol.

1:48:17.960 --> 1:48:23.880
 However, if someone does psychedelic or any things that is illegal and you do something

1:48:23.880 --> 1:48:28.760
 crazy, now we're going to put the fault on psychedelic.

1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:29.760
 You know what I mean?

1:48:29.760 --> 1:48:36.140
 And perhaps the person itself is the reason why, you know, he's been doing these things,

1:48:36.140 --> 1:48:37.280
 you know what I mean?

1:48:37.280 --> 1:48:43.520
 So yeah, it's fascinating how like society, you know, like in Canada, they just legalize

1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:44.520
 marijuana.

1:48:44.520 --> 1:48:45.520
 Oh yeah?

1:48:45.520 --> 1:48:46.520
 Yeah.

1:48:46.520 --> 1:48:47.520
 Marijuana is legal.

1:48:47.520 --> 1:48:51.680
 But before that, before they did it, like if you talk, for example, to my dad, my dad

1:48:51.680 --> 1:48:56.920
 is against it, like, because the whole mentality is like, it's drug, it's bad.

1:48:56.920 --> 1:48:59.440
 But drinking a glass, you know, drinking a beer, it's fine.

1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:02.580
 I mean, what is, you know what I mean?

1:49:02.580 --> 1:49:03.580
 What is good?

1:49:03.580 --> 1:49:04.580
 What is bad?

1:49:04.580 --> 1:49:09.920
 And I guess eating chocolate could be bad as well for your health or, I mean, I'm going

1:49:09.920 --> 1:49:12.560
 to the extreme now, but what is good?

1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:13.560
 What is bad?

1:49:13.560 --> 1:49:20.400
 If you use it for recreation, you use it for an experience, to learn about yourself, it's

1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:26.880
 a, the line is very tiny, you know, there's some countries that drugs are all legals,

1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:27.880
 you know what I mean?

1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:35.320
 And I don't know the stats, but I would be interesting to know if they have more crimes

1:49:35.320 --> 1:49:39.000
 there than other countries where it's more strict.

1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:41.280
 I would be interesting to know about that.

1:49:41.280 --> 1:49:43.000
 It's fascinating to me, you know?

1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:44.000
 Yeah.

1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:47.520
 And I mean, we humans kind of just come up with arbitrary lines of what's good, what's

1:49:47.520 --> 1:49:53.280
 bad that applies with drugs, that applies with anything, that applies with animals,

1:49:53.280 --> 1:49:54.280
 for example.

1:49:54.280 --> 1:49:56.560
 We talked about carnivore diet.

1:49:56.560 --> 1:50:02.880
 Maybe the time we live in now will be remembered for the cruelty to animals, for example.

1:50:02.880 --> 1:50:11.560
 And I believe this, the 21st century will be remembered for our cruelty to robots.

1:50:11.560 --> 1:50:19.000
 That eventually there'll be a civil rights movement for robots where the ones who choose

1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:25.080
 to be conscious, the ones who have consciousness will say, we deserve rights too.

1:50:25.080 --> 1:50:28.120
 We deserve to be treated with respect too.

1:50:28.120 --> 1:50:30.840
 How about the people we put in jail?

1:50:30.840 --> 1:50:31.840
 People put in jail.

1:50:31.840 --> 1:50:38.680
 I mean, I think in the future we'll look back and we'll think of ourselves being stupid,

1:50:38.680 --> 1:50:45.400
 you know, to put people in jail instead of, you know, like trying to fix the problem at

1:50:45.400 --> 1:50:46.400
 the base, you know?

1:50:46.400 --> 1:50:52.160
 Of course now we're, or I guess it's our ignorance that made it in a way that we cannot sometimes

1:50:52.160 --> 1:50:58.440
 understand what makes sometime a psychopath, a psychopath or a murderer, a murderer, but

1:50:58.440 --> 1:51:03.760
 you know, if we can pinpoint the problem and take care of it before, you know what I mean?

1:51:03.760 --> 1:51:09.400
 Or made it in a way that we can reestablish that person in the society.

1:51:09.400 --> 1:51:12.680
 You know, who knows, you know, what was the future's hold.

1:51:12.680 --> 1:51:13.680
 It's interesting.

1:51:13.680 --> 1:51:15.800
 We live in an interesting time.

1:51:15.800 --> 1:51:17.840
 You mentioned your father.

1:51:17.840 --> 1:51:20.360
 What have you learned from your dad?

1:51:20.360 --> 1:51:22.700
 You mentioned he was an important part of your childhood.

1:51:22.700 --> 1:51:25.160
 My dad is amazing.

1:51:25.160 --> 1:51:29.060
 I grew up, we didn't have a lot of money, but it doesn't mean if I'm born in a nice

1:51:29.060 --> 1:51:33.320
 country that always nice thing happened, you know?

1:51:33.320 --> 1:51:40.440
 My dad for me is a big role model because I see him through to my life facing a lot

1:51:40.440 --> 1:51:41.440
 of adversity.

1:51:41.440 --> 1:51:48.680
 You know, he stopped drinking when I was a teenager, he was an alcoholic and I seen him

1:51:48.680 --> 1:51:58.280
 struggle through that, you know, and it was very, very hard and I've seen him work like

1:51:58.280 --> 1:52:05.240
 crazy hours, like come leave in the morning, come home at night, burned out because of

1:52:05.240 --> 1:52:15.040
 work through almost all his life to the point that it became a slave of the system.

1:52:15.040 --> 1:52:21.160
 It became an habit and a normal way of living and it made me realize that I have learned

1:52:21.160 --> 1:52:23.340
 a lot through my father.

1:52:23.340 --> 1:52:28.360
 He taught me perseverance, hard work, you know, when you face adversity, you know, to

1:52:28.360 --> 1:52:36.760
 never give up until you achieve it, but also he taught me a lesson that in a way that I

1:52:36.760 --> 1:52:43.360
 don't want to be like him, even if he is happy, it's because I realized I don't think he knows

1:52:43.360 --> 1:52:44.360
 anything else.

1:52:44.360 --> 1:52:50.320
 Like he works through all his life and I don't want to live to work.

1:52:50.320 --> 1:52:54.080
 I want to work for, you know what I mean, I want to decide when I work, you know, I

1:52:54.080 --> 1:53:00.240
 feel like like he lived to work instead of working for a living.

1:53:00.240 --> 1:53:06.680
 And perhaps it's because he did not have choice, he was the older of his family, they were

1:53:06.680 --> 1:53:12.240
 nine kids, his dad, my grandfather died when he was young, so he had to become the father

1:53:12.240 --> 1:53:16.520
 of the family and work to put money on the table.

1:53:16.520 --> 1:53:24.800
 So perhaps that's what made him that way and it became like an habit for him.

1:53:24.800 --> 1:53:30.040
 My dad taught me when I was at school, I was bullied at school, he's the first one who

1:53:30.040 --> 1:53:32.140
 initiate me to martial art.

1:53:32.140 --> 1:53:37.120
 He taught me karate, my dad was a black belt in Kyokushin karate as well.

1:53:37.120 --> 1:53:43.000
 But because he was working too much, he didn't have time to teach me and I needed self defense

1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:46.360
 in order to defend myself.

1:53:46.360 --> 1:53:55.200
 I have a winning, a great career in mixed martial art, but in the school yard, my record

1:53:55.200 --> 1:53:57.880
 is not very good.

1:53:57.880 --> 1:54:05.440
 When you're a kid and you're about seven, eight years old and you're facing bullied

1:54:05.440 --> 1:54:13.360
 bullies that are two to three years older than yourself, it's not the same thing than

1:54:13.360 --> 1:54:15.520
 when you're 25 and the guy is 28.

1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:21.540
 So there was a big discrepancy in terms of maturity.

1:54:21.540 --> 1:54:29.180
 So my dad taught me, introduced me to karate, then he didn't have time to teach me.

1:54:29.180 --> 1:54:37.440
 Then he put me in a school with a teacher, it was Jean Couture.

1:54:37.440 --> 1:54:44.560
 And I grew up with a lot of anger and there were two persons I was afraid growing up.

1:54:44.560 --> 1:54:49.360
 It was my dad, my dad was very severe, very strict with me.

1:54:49.360 --> 1:54:53.760
 And I'm glad he was because I could have become very bad.

1:54:53.760 --> 1:54:57.240
 I could have become chosen on a different path.

1:54:57.240 --> 1:55:02.320
 People see me as a nice guy and I am a nice guy, I try to be a good role model, but I

1:55:02.320 --> 1:55:06.520
 could easily have turned towards a wrong path.

1:55:06.520 --> 1:55:08.000
 There's darkness somewhere in there.

1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:09.560
 Yes, there are a lot.

1:55:09.560 --> 1:55:19.480
 And a lot of my friends have chosen that path and unfortunately they are not with me today.

1:55:19.480 --> 1:55:25.140
 Even if I'm from Canada and Canada seems like the nicest country in the world, like I said,

1:55:25.140 --> 1:55:30.380
 even if you live in a nice country, it's not always a nice thing, it depends on the situation.

1:55:30.380 --> 1:55:32.220
 But that's what my dad taught me.

1:55:32.220 --> 1:55:41.440
 And he gave me that because I'm very good at learning by observing people and by observing

1:55:41.440 --> 1:55:47.520
 him I see the struggle he had with alcoholism and what he did, the pain sometimes that he

1:55:47.520 --> 1:55:50.800
 inflicted to us, to my family.

1:55:50.800 --> 1:55:59.520
 But how he turned, he did a 180 degree and I really admire that.

1:55:59.520 --> 1:56:05.480
 And I know it was very, very hard for him and he did it and for me that's a great role

1:56:05.480 --> 1:56:07.240
 model for me.

1:56:07.240 --> 1:56:13.720
 So with your dad being an engine of basically hard work and you finding a balance of being

1:56:13.720 --> 1:56:19.280
 able to work your ass off, but also to be able to enjoy a piece of chocolate, what is

1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:24.440
 a perfect day in the life of George St. Pierre look like?

1:56:24.440 --> 1:56:30.320
 So like if you were to go through a day that's very productive, but also one that makes you

1:56:30.320 --> 1:56:34.320
 sit back and enjoy and say that was a good day, what's that look like?

1:56:34.320 --> 1:56:36.080
 What are we talking about?

1:56:36.080 --> 1:56:37.080
 When do you wake up?

1:56:37.080 --> 1:56:38.080
 What do you eat?

1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:39.440
 What do you do?

1:56:39.440 --> 1:56:41.160
 It changed over the years.

1:56:41.160 --> 1:56:42.960
 When I was younger, I have a good day.

1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:47.640
 It was like a good training session or, you know, achieving good thing in my training,

1:56:47.640 --> 1:56:52.880
 you know, and that's why I was very good at it because when I, I was obsessed, you know,

1:56:52.880 --> 1:56:56.360
 I think to be good at something, you need to become obsessed.

1:56:56.360 --> 1:57:03.940
 And to me, performing in my training was everything, you know, like when I had a bad training session,

1:57:03.940 --> 1:57:08.880
 I didn't tell my training partner, I was acting like a, like because of my ego, I didn't,

1:57:08.880 --> 1:57:13.800
 you know, I didn't tell nobody, I was like, Hey, then I go in the locker room and like,

1:57:13.800 --> 1:57:20.840
 man, then I'm playing the, the, the, the training in my mind and I'm saying, okay, I should

1:57:20.840 --> 1:57:23.680
 have done this, should have done that, and it haunt me.

1:57:23.680 --> 1:57:25.040
 It haunt me, man.

1:57:25.040 --> 1:57:31.800
 It's a training and it haunt me until the next training session when I can redeem myself.

1:57:31.800 --> 1:57:33.640
 That's how it is.

1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:42.280
 When we used to train in, in all together, back in the day in Canada, we had David Loiseau,

1:57:42.280 --> 1:57:49.840
 we had Patrick Côté, we had Dennis Kang, Steve Vignot, Jonathan Goulet, there was all

1:57:49.840 --> 1:57:55.600
 like the best guy in Canada that were training with each other before we were training in

1:57:55.600 --> 1:57:56.600
 different gyms.

1:57:56.600 --> 1:58:02.960
 But once a week, I made it in a way that I contact everybody that we all join force and

1:58:02.960 --> 1:58:06.320
 we exchange ideas and we train with each other.

1:58:06.320 --> 1:58:09.200
 So a friendly, I would say friendly competition.

1:58:09.200 --> 1:58:14.440
 It was not malicious, but it was hard training, you know, like not, our goal was to improve,

1:58:14.440 --> 1:58:17.960
 you know, but it wasn't very competitive.

1:58:17.960 --> 1:58:23.000
 And when that day you used to get out of the training session with a bad performance for

1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:29.440
 me, it used to haunt me until the following week when I could give it back and perform

1:58:29.440 --> 1:58:33.200
 better with the guy that I had the most trouble with.

1:58:33.200 --> 1:58:34.580
 That's how it was.

1:58:34.580 --> 1:58:41.040
 And that's how you get better, you know, but, but it was not a training where we were trying

1:58:41.040 --> 1:58:43.400
 to do malicious thing to one another.

1:58:43.400 --> 1:58:45.040
 You know what I mean?

1:58:45.040 --> 1:58:49.440
 You need to be playful, but playful, but competitive.

1:58:49.440 --> 1:58:53.800
 That when I had a good training session, because the sparring was on a Friday, I had the best

1:58:53.800 --> 1:58:54.800
 weekend in the world.

1:58:54.800 --> 1:58:57.840
 I was going out with my friend, drinking and partying and have fun.

1:58:57.840 --> 1:59:05.920
 That that was, that was my, my, my, my ideal day back in the day.

1:59:05.920 --> 1:59:06.920
 Today has changed.

1:59:06.920 --> 1:59:09.640
 You know, my, my, my, my life has changed.

1:59:09.640 --> 1:59:17.500
 You know, like I, I am not the same person I used to be when I got, went on my knees

1:59:17.500 --> 1:59:20.040
 and beg the UFC for title shot.

1:59:20.040 --> 1:59:21.040
 You know what I mean?

1:59:21.040 --> 1:59:25.440
 I am a, I'm wealthy, I'm healthy.

1:59:25.440 --> 1:59:28.200
 Most importantly, that's the most important thing.

1:59:28.200 --> 1:59:35.320
 And as, and I'm going to tell you the truth, as good as my career was, man, my private

1:59:35.320 --> 1:59:39.960
 life, man, is a million times better, man.

1:59:39.960 --> 1:59:45.400
 I, and, and people ask me sometimes they always wonder, they, they try to ask me and it's

1:59:45.400 --> 1:59:46.400
 normal.

1:59:46.400 --> 1:59:54.160
 It's a lot of people is curious and the reporter and in the sport of mixed martial art, we

1:59:54.160 --> 1:59:58.920
 say we play basketball, we play soccer, but you don't play fighting.

1:59:58.920 --> 2:00:04.280
 So when you expose your private life, we seen that happen in the fight with sometime Conor

2:00:04.280 --> 2:00:09.640
 McGregor and Khabib, your competitor knows that he cannot get to you.

2:00:09.640 --> 2:00:13.680
 So what he will do, he will try to get to someone that you love.

2:00:13.680 --> 2:00:16.440
 So may I never expose my, my private life.

2:00:16.440 --> 2:00:21.480
 I never post Instagram of my family or my stuff.

2:00:21.480 --> 2:00:26.920
 That's the reason why, because I'm in a, I'm in a business of fighting and people know

2:00:26.920 --> 2:00:29.720
 that they cannot get to me.

2:00:29.720 --> 2:00:37.640
 And I believe because I was bullied when I was young, I didn't realize that when I was

2:00:37.640 --> 2:00:44.560
 young, but it helps me deal with the mental warfare that I need, that I had to face later

2:00:44.560 --> 2:00:48.520
 on in my life and mixed martial art, because it's a very egotistic sport.

2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:54.140
 And there's a lot of, a lot and a lot of intimidation.

2:00:54.140 --> 2:00:57.520
 And I was used to, I've been used to this thing when I was young.

2:00:57.520 --> 2:01:05.600
 So it does not get to me, however, the good way to get to me, go, go, go, go try to get

2:01:05.600 --> 2:01:09.800
 to someone I love now, man, I'm going to go crazy.

2:01:09.800 --> 2:01:11.280
 You know what I mean?

2:01:11.280 --> 2:01:12.280
 And I'm aware of that.

2:01:12.280 --> 2:01:18.800
 So in order to protect myself, I always, because I'm aware I'm a public person.

2:01:18.800 --> 2:01:22.880
 So I try to always keep my surrounding like in the private.

2:01:22.880 --> 2:01:31.120
 You know, one of the ways that like your friend and mine, Joe Rogan has been an inspiration

2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:35.960
 that he's got like an incredible family and he, for the most part, it started to change

2:01:35.960 --> 2:01:36.960
 recently.

2:01:36.960 --> 2:01:39.160
 Actually, it's kind of interesting, but for the most part, throughout his life, he kept

2:01:39.160 --> 2:01:41.160
 it pretty secret.

2:01:41.160 --> 2:01:44.300
 Doesn't talk about it in his, he's a comedian, comedians talk about everything.

2:01:44.300 --> 2:01:46.600
 He doesn't really talk about it.

2:01:46.600 --> 2:01:48.320
 And there's something to that.

2:01:48.320 --> 2:01:52.160
 It like preserves the magic of the silence of the private life.

2:01:52.160 --> 2:01:57.040
 And I think it can affect the development of the kid.

2:01:57.040 --> 2:02:04.360
 If the kid grow up being, oh, he's the son of that guy instead of being his own person.

2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:06.200
 You know what I mean?

2:02:06.200 --> 2:02:08.760
 So for me, it's very important.

2:02:08.760 --> 2:02:11.800
 Like my parents are older, it's fine.

2:02:11.800 --> 2:02:13.820
 But it taught me a big lesson.

2:02:13.820 --> 2:02:18.560
 When I'm with my friend at the dinner or anything, I talk with person, always share a thing.

2:02:18.560 --> 2:02:23.160
 But when I'm talking, I'm aware of the audience where I'm in front.

2:02:23.160 --> 2:02:24.160
 Yeah.

2:02:24.160 --> 2:02:26.480
 And I mean, but oftentimes those people are just incredible.

2:02:26.480 --> 2:02:31.720
 It kind of makes me sad that, you know, there's a lot of people that love you, right?

2:02:31.720 --> 2:02:35.600
 And there are a lot of really incredible people and you'll never get to really know their

2:02:35.600 --> 2:02:36.600
 story.

2:02:36.600 --> 2:02:38.720
 I mean, I don't know, for me, it makes me sad.

2:02:38.720 --> 2:02:40.520
 You see them like at airports and stuff.

2:02:40.520 --> 2:02:44.200
 People will tell me they listen to this podcast or something like that.

2:02:44.200 --> 2:02:46.240
 And I could tell they're incredible people.

2:02:46.240 --> 2:02:50.280
 It makes me it's like a little goodbye of a possible friend.

2:02:50.280 --> 2:02:51.280
 I don't know.

2:02:51.280 --> 2:02:52.280
 It makes me sad.

2:02:52.280 --> 2:02:53.280
 All right.

2:02:53.280 --> 2:02:55.320
 It makes me it's lonely.

2:02:55.320 --> 2:02:57.980
 It's almost like celebrity is a lonely thing.

2:02:57.980 --> 2:03:02.360
 So the higher the celebrity, the more lonely you become in some kind of way.

2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:06.880
 But of course, you have that little gem of a private life where you can personally, I

2:03:06.880 --> 2:03:14.540
 believe every relationship I like, I don't like to use this term, but it's always a give

2:03:14.540 --> 2:03:20.880
 and take relationship, you know, like you can gain something and the person like it

2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:26.560
 could be something like not materialist materialistic, like something always a good, confident like

2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:30.640
 someone that can give me good advice or.

2:03:30.640 --> 2:03:35.800
 It's a word I would say, like extensional, like if a pilot as a copilot is the copilot

2:03:35.800 --> 2:03:40.280
 is extent as an extensional relationship with him, you know, so he knows if he gets sick

2:03:40.280 --> 2:03:45.360
 or faint, he's there to make sure, you know, he's there to help.

2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:50.600
 And I think in every relation it's about compatibility, but it's about extensionality, right?

2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:56.800
 In a way that if that person is extensional and sometimes we talk about about love, you

2:03:56.800 --> 2:04:01.440
 know, like sometimes I think is it is it a BS word or not?

2:04:01.440 --> 2:04:08.080
 Because I myself sometimes look at I look at myself in the mirror and when I do stupid

2:04:08.080 --> 2:04:12.140
 thing, sometimes I love myself a lot and sometimes I don't.

2:04:12.140 --> 2:04:13.620
 You know what I mean?

2:04:13.620 --> 2:04:17.320
 Because I'm angry at myself, I've done stupid thing.

2:04:17.320 --> 2:04:20.360
 So that means sometimes you could love could be fluctuating.

2:04:20.360 --> 2:04:21.360
 You know what I mean?

2:04:21.360 --> 2:04:22.880
 How about in relationships?

2:04:22.880 --> 2:04:26.360
 Sometimes people, they say, oh, they love each other, but then when they divorce, they

2:04:26.360 --> 2:04:30.240
 go, oh, I want the house and the dog and the kids stay with me.

2:04:30.240 --> 2:04:32.040
 And you know what I mean?

2:04:32.040 --> 2:04:38.920
 If you love, by definition, if you really love someone and let's say you're an old man

2:04:38.920 --> 2:04:43.200
 and you love a woman and she decides to leave you for a younger man, if you really love

2:04:43.200 --> 2:04:47.540
 her, you're going to help her pack and leave.

2:04:47.540 --> 2:04:51.680
 But in our society, sometimes we want to hone something.

2:04:51.680 --> 2:04:57.520
 To me, love includes the missing somebody, the losing somebody, the anger at somebody.

2:04:57.520 --> 2:05:00.440
 It's all the passion, feelings towards somebody.

2:05:00.440 --> 2:05:01.440
 That's all love.

2:05:01.440 --> 2:05:03.440
 I, you know, it's all part of the thing.

2:05:03.440 --> 2:05:05.440
 It's the ups and downs.

2:05:05.440 --> 2:05:13.040
 It's the sad thing is when the feelings towards a person, the ups and downs go away, the forgetting.

2:05:13.040 --> 2:05:14.200
 That's the opposite of love.

2:05:14.200 --> 2:05:16.160
 So the opposite of love isn't hate.

2:05:16.160 --> 2:05:19.520
 To me, the opposite of love is forgetting.

2:05:19.520 --> 2:05:23.340
 And that's a much bigger, that's the depth of human connection.

2:05:23.340 --> 2:05:25.000
 That's how I see love.

2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:30.780
 Sometimes I try to stay positive and I've been asked how I try to, because I have the

2:05:30.780 --> 2:05:33.200
 image of someone who's positive.

2:05:33.200 --> 2:05:36.120
 But I go through my own demon as well sometimes.

2:05:36.120 --> 2:05:46.380
 However, when we talk about love, when I was young, you know, like, I didn't love who I

2:05:46.380 --> 2:05:47.380
 was at first.

2:05:47.380 --> 2:05:51.360
 That's how I love, I learned to kind of love myself.

2:05:51.360 --> 2:05:57.360
 Like I didn't, when I was going to bullying, I was, I believe I was bullied because I didn't

2:05:57.360 --> 2:06:03.960
 love myself because I project a very bad image of what I think of myself.

2:06:03.960 --> 2:06:06.000
 I was a kid that lacked a lot of confidence.

2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:08.360
 I was looking down when I was walking.

2:06:08.360 --> 2:06:10.320
 I shrugged my shoulder.

2:06:10.320 --> 2:06:14.120
 When someone was talking to me, I was avoiding eye contact.

2:06:14.120 --> 2:06:17.520
 So I was a very easy target for bullies.

2:06:17.520 --> 2:06:22.700
 And I think bullies are like a predatory animal in nature.

2:06:22.700 --> 2:06:25.520
 They will hunt the easier prey.

2:06:25.520 --> 2:06:30.040
 They don't go, the lion don't go for the alpha bull.

2:06:30.040 --> 2:06:33.720
 They go for the one who's old or who's sick, the weakest one.

2:06:33.720 --> 2:06:36.680
 And bullies are the same in society, I believe.

2:06:36.680 --> 2:06:42.880
 And I didn't like to be bullied, of course, but I didn't like the person that I was.

2:06:42.880 --> 2:06:53.040
 But I found out through martial art, the respect and my coach was extraordinary to me.

2:06:53.040 --> 2:06:56.600
 He taught me discipline and self strength.

2:06:56.600 --> 2:07:03.080
 And I found out that I needed to, in order to love myself, I needed to change myself.

2:07:03.080 --> 2:07:07.040
 Because I didn't, when I looked at myself in the mirror, I didn't like what I saw.

2:07:07.040 --> 2:07:12.680
 So I decided to become like someone that I would love.

2:07:12.680 --> 2:07:23.600
 So I tried to look people straight up and try to showcase a more confident image that

2:07:23.600 --> 2:07:24.600
 I had.

2:07:24.600 --> 2:07:29.640
 And it was hard in the beginning because I didn't really believe in it, but I fake it

2:07:29.640 --> 2:07:31.720
 until kind of I make it.

2:07:31.720 --> 2:07:37.640
 So when I was walking at school, more and more I was learning how to become more confident

2:07:37.640 --> 2:07:40.560
 and I was like taking charge.

2:07:40.560 --> 2:07:44.520
 The teacher was asking questions, at first I was never answering, I was like this, waiting

2:07:44.520 --> 2:07:45.920
 always to be the last.

2:07:45.920 --> 2:07:49.640
 Then I was, hey, I know what the answer, this is the answer.

2:07:49.640 --> 2:07:55.460
 I got out of my comfort zone, so to speak.

2:07:55.460 --> 2:08:01.720
 And I wish I would tell you that I got out of bullying because a Hollywood story, I used

2:08:01.720 --> 2:08:04.120
 martial art to beat up all the bullies.

2:08:04.120 --> 2:08:06.060
 But it's not how it happened to me.

2:08:06.060 --> 2:08:11.000
 It happened because I changed myself from the inside out.

2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:18.160
 And I learned how to, because I didn't love myself in the beginning, I learned how to

2:08:18.160 --> 2:08:21.200
 become like someone that I love.

2:08:21.200 --> 2:08:28.600
 And even now, like I'm by no mean perfect, I do a lot of stupid things, but I learn as

2:08:28.600 --> 2:08:29.600
 a person.

2:08:29.600 --> 2:08:34.320
 And even I do as something stupid, I'm like, shoot, I did something stupid.

2:08:34.320 --> 2:08:39.680
 At least I can apologize to the person if I realize, and then I know that I'm not the

2:08:39.680 --> 2:08:45.280
 person I was in the past, I'm the person that I am right now.

2:08:45.280 --> 2:08:49.960
 So I can learn and become that image of the person that I love.

2:08:49.960 --> 2:08:55.640
 So in a way, the reason I'm trying to be positive and I'm able to stay positive sometime in

2:08:55.640 --> 2:09:03.340
 life is because I'm always trying to be like that person that I love.

2:09:03.340 --> 2:09:07.320
 And I think if you don't look yourself in the mirror and don't love yourself or don't

2:09:07.320 --> 2:09:12.080
 see any positive future for yourself, how can you change your environment if you cannot

2:09:12.080 --> 2:09:13.080
 change yourself?

2:09:13.080 --> 2:09:14.340
 You know what I mean?

2:09:14.340 --> 2:09:18.960
 You will never be happy if you're not happy when you look at yourself in the mirror.

2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:22.560
 So change yourself first, then change, you know, it's not the environment that's going

2:09:22.560 --> 2:09:24.120
 to change for yourself.

2:09:24.120 --> 2:09:29.520
 You have to go from the inside out, you know.

2:09:29.520 --> 2:09:30.720
 This I learned through martial art.

2:09:30.720 --> 2:09:38.240
 I had a coach who was incredible, used to drill these ideas in my head and give me confidence,

2:09:38.240 --> 2:09:44.200
 you know, like this, telling me all these beautiful things about myself and how he's

2:09:44.200 --> 2:09:46.720
 dead now, unfortunately, peace to him.

2:09:46.720 --> 2:09:49.400
 But he was incredible, incredible.

2:09:49.400 --> 2:09:50.480
 He was very, very strict.

2:09:50.480 --> 2:09:51.480
 I was afraid of him.

2:09:51.480 --> 2:09:53.680
 I was afraid of my dad and afraid of him.

2:09:53.680 --> 2:09:58.560
 He couldn't teach nowadays like he used to teach me because he would be probably in jail,

2:09:58.560 --> 2:09:59.680
 you know.

2:09:59.680 --> 2:10:04.960
 But I'm glad he did it because for the time being, that's what I needed.

2:10:04.960 --> 2:10:10.800
 And I would never have had the career I had in mixed martial art without this because

2:10:10.800 --> 2:10:15.400
 I would never have got out of my comfort zone, would have been impossible.

2:10:15.400 --> 2:10:19.480
 And in order to improve in life, you need to get out of your comfort zone.

2:10:19.480 --> 2:10:22.480
 It's hard, very hard to do.

2:10:22.480 --> 2:10:28.160
 And strive to be the person that you can love, that's beautifully put, George.

2:10:28.160 --> 2:10:34.520
 If you were to give advice to a young person today about life, what would you tell him?

2:10:34.520 --> 2:10:47.920
 If he takes life with the same mentality that I do, if he has the same taste of things that

2:10:47.920 --> 2:10:58.020
 I have, I would tell him, you know, for sport, for life in general, I would say, if you will

2:10:58.020 --> 2:11:08.920
 have a dream, you know, like make everything in your power and work very hard, you know,

2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:18.120
 never take no for an answer and go through hell in order to achieve it.

2:11:18.120 --> 2:11:23.200
 Don't work hard only, but work smart.

2:11:23.200 --> 2:11:27.520
 That's I think the problems with a lot of people, they work hard, they can work hard,

2:11:27.520 --> 2:11:30.400
 they burden themselves, they don't work smart.

2:11:30.400 --> 2:11:38.520
 Whether it is in science and business, they make bad choices or they're badly informed

2:11:38.520 --> 2:11:39.520
 in sport.

2:11:39.520 --> 2:11:47.000
 How many guys I've seen ruin their career in the gym, they spar so hard, they ruin themselves

2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:51.000
 in the gyms, they leave their career in the gyms.

2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:55.360
 What I would say to, for example, because my field of expertise, it's in sport of mixed

2:11:55.360 --> 2:12:05.760
 martial art, I would say to a young kid, make your training playful.

2:12:05.760 --> 2:12:14.080
 You know, when you get ready for competition, you need to train to recreate those elements

2:12:14.080 --> 2:12:18.120
 that makes you go outside of your comfort zone.

2:12:18.120 --> 2:12:23.260
 But in everyday life in general, make your training playful.

2:12:23.260 --> 2:12:29.120
 What makes it like a hardcore competition about who's winning, who's losing, make it

2:12:29.120 --> 2:12:30.120
 playful.

2:12:30.120 --> 2:12:39.560
 So it will increase your, because you will not be afraid of getting hurt or losing.

2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:49.440
 You will be tempted to try more things and it will make you become more creative.

2:12:49.440 --> 2:12:53.200
 You know, that brings up another question about learning.

2:12:53.200 --> 2:13:00.780
 So you value knowledge and you're exceptional at basically being very good at learning and

2:13:00.780 --> 2:13:05.500
 figuring stuff out, new things or going deeper on the things you already know.

2:13:05.500 --> 2:13:10.260
 So what advice would you have for how to learn effectively?

2:13:10.260 --> 2:13:16.080
 How you say work smart, how do you figure this game out?

2:13:16.080 --> 2:13:23.560
 I believe the best way to learn is learning from other people's mistake.

2:13:23.560 --> 2:13:30.480
 However, I'm not perfect and I've learned from my mistakes as well.

2:13:30.480 --> 2:13:37.960
 And sometimes it took me a few mistakes to learn the same thing.

2:13:37.960 --> 2:13:44.600
 But especially in the sport of mixed martial art, because we're talking about the failure

2:13:44.600 --> 2:13:51.600
 could have very serious outcome on someone's life and wellbeing.

2:13:51.600 --> 2:13:56.280
 So it's crucial to trying to learn from other people's mistakes.

2:13:56.280 --> 2:13:59.080
 Do you study others?

2:13:59.080 --> 2:14:09.120
 Every fight I'm studying my opponent and I've studied myself as well to know how my strength

2:14:09.120 --> 2:14:17.920
 mix versus my opponent weaknesses and how can I make the fight go in a way that I'm

2:14:17.920 --> 2:14:22.020
 taking my opponent outside of his comfort zone.

2:14:22.020 --> 2:14:25.960
 Very often people are good at studying their opponent, but they're not good at looking

2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:31.400
 at themselves in the mirror and knowing what they should do in order to maximize their

2:14:31.400 --> 2:14:34.360
 odds of success, right?

2:14:34.360 --> 2:14:42.120
 That's why I always thought for me, it was important to not be the best at one thing,

2:14:42.120 --> 2:14:47.120
 but be very good at everything.

2:14:47.120 --> 2:14:54.240
 That's why I always seek advice, advices from the best in every discipline.

2:14:54.240 --> 2:15:02.400
 I wrestle with the best wrestler I could be with, I box with the best boxers, I practice

2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:05.000
 karate with the best karate fighters.

2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:06.000
 Same thing in Jiu Jitsu.

2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:09.800
 I train Jiu Jitsu with the best Jiu Jitsu guys.

2:15:09.800 --> 2:15:19.220
 However, when I mix everything and mix martial art, because I'm very competent in every area.

2:15:19.220 --> 2:15:27.700
 So when I'm fighting someone, I'm very good at identifying where is the less competent.

2:15:27.700 --> 2:15:33.280
 And I know for a fact that because I'm competent everywhere, if I can bring the fight where

2:15:33.280 --> 2:15:36.920
 he's outside of his comfort zone, it increased my odds of winning.

2:15:36.920 --> 2:15:38.500
 There is no certainty.

2:15:38.500 --> 2:15:43.320
 It's all about odds, I believe, because there is always X factor that you do not control.

2:15:43.320 --> 2:15:48.920
 Yeah, it's fascinating to see you actually, because you've been a student of movement.

2:15:48.920 --> 2:15:53.120
 You've been exploring all kinds of, I mean, gymnastics, all that kind of stuff.

2:15:53.120 --> 2:15:59.120
 There's something reminiscent to, like Conor McGregor is one other martial artist that's

2:15:59.120 --> 2:16:03.320
 kind of explored movement, been a scholar of movement.

2:16:03.320 --> 2:16:09.000
 At least from my perspective, it's very sort of Bruce Lee like, it's almost making a study

2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:12.440
 of the human body and all the possible things you can do.

2:16:12.440 --> 2:16:15.820
 Is there a philosophy behind that, that you have?

2:16:15.820 --> 2:16:20.800
 You talk about Bruce Lee, man, you said it best.

2:16:20.800 --> 2:16:23.680
 He changes my life too.

2:16:23.680 --> 2:16:25.160
 He was ahead of his time.

2:16:25.160 --> 2:16:26.160
 Yeah.

2:16:26.160 --> 2:16:27.160
 Incredible.

2:16:27.160 --> 2:16:30.280
 A lot of people talk to me and ask me, hey, is Bruce Lee would have been able to fight

2:16:30.280 --> 2:16:33.280
 in UFC?

2:16:33.280 --> 2:16:34.960
 I don't think so.

2:16:34.960 --> 2:16:36.320
 I don't know.

2:16:36.320 --> 2:16:38.820
 I think he was a martial artist.

2:16:38.820 --> 2:16:43.400
 He could have defended himself, but to say that he could have competed amongst the elite

2:16:43.400 --> 2:16:48.360
 of the elite fighter, perhaps in his time, but for sure, if you put him in UFC right

2:16:48.360 --> 2:16:55.200
 now, the sport has improved incredibly since then.

2:16:55.200 --> 2:17:00.320
 But in terms of philosophy, Bruce, he was amazing.

2:17:00.320 --> 2:17:04.640
 One thing that just to prove that he was ahead of his time, he was talking about using your

2:17:04.640 --> 2:17:08.080
 longest weapon against your opponent nearest point.

2:17:08.080 --> 2:17:17.220
 And we see that kick, it got popularized by John Jones, the sidekick to the tie, his longest

2:17:17.220 --> 2:17:20.360
 weapon against your nearest point in boxing is the jab.

2:17:20.360 --> 2:17:26.680
 But in MMA, when you can use it, all your weapon, that's the kick to the tie.

2:17:26.680 --> 2:17:32.520
 And there is, I felt there is like kind of three dimension in martial art.

2:17:32.520 --> 2:17:34.960
 There is the philosopher, like Bruce Lee.

2:17:34.960 --> 2:17:40.880
 There is the choreography, the choreographed people, like for example, you see in movies

2:17:40.880 --> 2:17:42.240
 that stun people.

2:17:42.240 --> 2:17:43.240
 They're incredible.

2:17:43.240 --> 2:17:49.240
 Or the one that does like forms and karate, like jumping, spin kick, back kick, like acrobatic

2:17:49.240 --> 2:17:50.600
 stuff, mixed martial art.

2:17:50.600 --> 2:17:52.360
 They are unbelievable.

2:17:52.360 --> 2:17:57.240
 And there is also the one that competes in fighting.

2:17:57.240 --> 2:17:58.240
 That's what I do.

2:17:58.240 --> 2:18:01.120
 I personally specialize in.

2:18:01.120 --> 2:18:03.160
 Well, you also do the philosophy.

2:18:03.160 --> 2:18:07.960
 I do a little bit of philosophy, but that's the consequence of the fighting.

2:18:07.960 --> 2:18:14.800
 I guess we are all like we all practice the three dimension because martial art is I would

2:18:14.800 --> 2:18:20.240
 say it's whether you want it or not, you have to touch these three dimensions.

2:18:20.240 --> 2:18:21.920
 But you will specialize in one.

2:18:21.920 --> 2:18:29.020
 I specialize through my life in fighting like the real thing in terms of fighting, competition.

2:18:29.020 --> 2:18:32.600
 Of course, if you do martial art, you'll be able to defend yourself because it's a self

2:18:32.600 --> 2:18:33.600
 defense.

2:18:33.600 --> 2:18:39.280
 However, you might not be able to fight as an elite and the most prestigious organization.

2:18:39.280 --> 2:18:44.880
 And you might not be able to perform the stunt that, for example, the stuntman I've done

2:18:44.880 --> 2:18:50.840
 in the series I was playing in the Falcon and Winter Soldier, these guys are incredible.

2:18:50.840 --> 2:18:52.920
 They're like real life superhero.

2:18:52.920 --> 2:18:57.420
 Things they do, to me, like it's fascinating.

2:18:57.420 --> 2:18:58.640
 It's amazing.

2:18:58.640 --> 2:19:01.160
 And also Bruce Lee, the philosophy.

2:19:01.160 --> 2:19:08.040
 How many hours he took like thinking about these stuff, you know, I'm sure he did not

2:19:08.040 --> 2:19:16.120
 just came out of nowhere, you know, like he was thinking that's mean he slept on this.

2:19:16.120 --> 2:19:17.120
 How many hours?

2:19:17.120 --> 2:19:18.120
 It's just unbelievable.

2:19:18.120 --> 2:19:19.400
 He's like water, my friend.

2:19:19.400 --> 2:19:24.360
 How many times has he thought about water going to bed before he said that?

2:19:24.360 --> 2:19:27.880
 Well, let me ask a very important fundamental question about martial arts.

2:19:27.880 --> 2:19:30.880
 We're both wearing a suit and tie.

2:19:30.880 --> 2:19:35.000
 Joe Rogan thinks that wearing a tie is a huge disadvantage.

2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:37.200
 Is it a clip on or is it an actual tie?

2:19:37.200 --> 2:19:39.860
 It's an actual tie, I really want it.

2:19:39.860 --> 2:19:47.600
 So do you agree or disagree with Joe Rogan that wearing a tie is a martial arts significant

2:19:47.600 --> 2:19:51.680
 disadvantage in terms of combat, in a combat scenario?

2:19:51.680 --> 2:19:53.920
 In a fight, I think it would be a disadvantage.

2:19:53.920 --> 2:19:54.920
 Yes.

2:19:54.920 --> 2:19:55.920
 Okay.

2:19:55.920 --> 2:20:02.800
 I work as a security bouncer in nightclubs and event when I was 18 years old.

2:20:02.800 --> 2:20:09.280
 And sometime I had to work in certain event that I was in suit and tie.

2:20:09.280 --> 2:20:17.120
 I never had to use my force to take someone out when I was in suit and tie.

2:20:17.120 --> 2:20:22.560
 But if I would have had to before going to the table to physically take the guy out,

2:20:22.560 --> 2:20:26.800
 I would have removed my tie and I would have removed my vest for sure.

2:20:26.800 --> 2:20:29.320
 And I would have called back up for sure.

2:20:29.320 --> 2:20:36.240
 And I would have probably used the element of surprise to be first on the guy.

2:20:36.240 --> 2:20:41.960
 When you're in a bar, same thing, you call back up first and you make sure you ask the

2:20:41.960 --> 2:20:46.040
 waitress before to clean the table before you go.

2:20:46.040 --> 2:20:49.960
 And when you go, you have to use the element of surprise.

2:20:49.960 --> 2:20:54.200
 Because fighting, fighting in mixed martial arts and fighting in the street, it's two

2:20:54.200 --> 2:20:56.000
 different things.

2:20:56.000 --> 2:21:00.200
 And yes, I'm a mixed martial arts competitor.

2:21:00.200 --> 2:21:01.280
 That's what I've done all my life.

2:21:01.280 --> 2:21:04.640
 But I had a lot of street fight in my life, a lot when I was in...

2:21:04.640 --> 2:21:05.640
 What's the difference?

2:21:05.640 --> 2:21:06.640
 What's like the...

2:21:06.640 --> 2:21:07.640
 Oh my God.

2:21:07.640 --> 2:21:08.640
 It's a huge difference.

2:21:08.640 --> 2:21:16.000
 There is guys that if I would have a choice, you know, to fight, like, for example, certain

2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:20.800
 guys in UFC in a street fight and fight like other guys that are not in UFC, I would maybe

2:21:20.800 --> 2:21:24.600
 sometimes pick guys that are not in UFC, not necessarily.

2:21:24.600 --> 2:21:28.360
 Because in a street fight, there's no referee that says go.

2:21:28.360 --> 2:21:29.700
 It's the element of surprise.

2:21:29.700 --> 2:21:33.020
 And when you're a nice guy, you're not the aggressor.

2:21:33.020 --> 2:21:35.340
 You always have the element of surprise.

2:21:35.340 --> 2:21:36.340
 That's what it taught me.

2:21:36.340 --> 2:21:37.340
 Oh, interesting.

2:21:37.340 --> 2:21:38.340
 Yes.

2:21:38.340 --> 2:21:45.420
 Because if the person will not come punch you without warning, it needs to, it needs

2:21:45.420 --> 2:21:46.640
 to trigger some...

2:21:46.640 --> 2:21:49.340
 It's something that needs to be triggered before.

2:21:49.340 --> 2:21:54.320
 So if someone comes because he's looking for trouble, there is a sign that he's looking

2:21:54.320 --> 2:21:56.020
 for trouble.

2:21:56.020 --> 2:22:00.000
 So I was just talking with Bas Rutten this weekend about it.

2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:01.360
 I saw that.

2:22:01.360 --> 2:22:04.360
 Every martial art comes from...

2:22:04.360 --> 2:22:11.340
 Like some martial art are from Exclusivik for competition, like sport karate, like certain

2:22:11.340 --> 2:22:12.620
 martial art.

2:22:12.620 --> 2:22:17.980
 But traditional martial art are for the street, are for self defense.

2:22:17.980 --> 2:22:21.040
 And I start my background in Kyokushinkarate, so it's for...

2:22:21.040 --> 2:22:22.320
 And I did Japanese Jiu Jitsu.

2:22:22.320 --> 2:22:27.280
 So my background, before I even start training for mixed martial art, my background is in

2:22:27.280 --> 2:22:30.040
 self defense.

2:22:30.040 --> 2:22:33.960
 And it's very important to understand that in a street fight, the element of surprise

2:22:33.960 --> 2:22:34.960
 is everything.

2:22:34.960 --> 2:22:35.960
 And there are no rules.

2:22:35.960 --> 2:22:39.200
 You can go for the eyes, the necks, the...

2:22:39.200 --> 2:22:40.200
 It surprises everything.

2:22:40.200 --> 2:22:43.040
 Total, total ballgame, you know what I mean?

2:22:43.040 --> 2:22:48.220
 You have the chair, the beard, there's so much more thing going on.

2:22:48.220 --> 2:22:50.120
 So the idea of...

2:22:50.120 --> 2:22:52.880
 Because you are a UFC fighter, you think you're invincible.

2:22:52.880 --> 2:22:55.160
 This is BS.

2:22:55.160 --> 2:22:56.160
 Anybody can come.

2:22:56.160 --> 2:23:00.000
 Like if a big guy who punch very hard, most people don't know how to punch.

2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:02.800
 By the way, they don't know how to make a fist and throw it in a forward direction.

2:23:02.800 --> 2:23:06.380
 But if someone knows how to do it, I don't care who you are.

2:23:06.380 --> 2:23:10.880
 If you could be Francis and Genu, someone come behind your head and bang.

2:23:10.880 --> 2:23:14.640
 Or let's say there's an argument and you get surprised by a punch.

2:23:14.640 --> 2:23:17.920
 You can be drop and lose a fight, that doesn't matter.

2:23:17.920 --> 2:23:20.160
 The element of surprise is everything.

2:23:20.160 --> 2:23:25.400
 So you were saying remove all the sources of the elements of surprise, clear the bar,

2:23:25.400 --> 2:23:26.400
 remove the tie.

2:23:26.400 --> 2:23:30.800
 I still disagree with you about the tie.

2:23:30.800 --> 2:23:38.280
 Just for your information, if someone comes looking for trouble and you see me do this

2:23:38.280 --> 2:23:43.320
 and going sideways a little bit, that's my position that I'm thinking maybe something

2:23:43.320 --> 2:23:52.440
 will happen and I'm about to punch you or to do something to take care of this situation.

2:23:52.440 --> 2:23:58.320
 To flip the table on you then, wearing a tie is communicating the nice guy image.

2:23:58.320 --> 2:24:03.160
 So it actually gives you the freedom for more elements of surprise by wearing the tie.

2:24:03.160 --> 2:24:09.400
 If you take it off, you're limiting your options because nobody's going to expect the guy in

2:24:09.400 --> 2:24:10.840
 the tie to do anything.

2:24:10.840 --> 2:24:19.080
 I'm a big believer that sometimes it's not only materialism, it's what you project.

2:24:19.080 --> 2:24:24.760
 Let's say I had troubles in a bar and I was able to deflect, the guy was looking for trouble

2:24:24.760 --> 2:24:30.040
 talking to me and I was able to deflect his whole aggressivity by saying like, hey, man,

2:24:30.040 --> 2:24:31.040
 that's a nice shirt.

2:24:31.040 --> 2:24:32.520
 Where did you get it?

2:24:32.520 --> 2:24:38.160
 Like saying like something or stupid like this, then it kind of breaks the momentum

2:24:38.160 --> 2:24:40.960
 and he, you know, but the guy was looking for trouble.

2:24:40.960 --> 2:24:42.520
 I don't want to fight you.

2:24:42.520 --> 2:24:48.400
 I don't want to fight you, but I'm not going to wait until you pull, you make the first

2:24:48.400 --> 2:24:54.360
 move because the minute you touch me, you push me or you touch me, you declare war and

2:24:54.360 --> 2:25:00.280
 the war is unleashed, my friend, and I'm taking you out of order with the necessary force,

2:25:00.280 --> 2:25:01.280
 of course.

2:25:01.280 --> 2:25:02.280
 You know what I mean?

2:25:02.280 --> 2:25:05.100
 That's the thing with martial art.

2:25:05.100 --> 2:25:09.520
 If you use the necessary force to take care of the problem, it's okay.

2:25:09.520 --> 2:25:13.860
 But if you, you know, you take advantage of it, that's when it's not all right because

2:25:13.860 --> 2:25:15.280
 it's a weapon.

2:25:15.280 --> 2:25:22.940
 So if someone comes up to me, that's my position and now I'm assessing the situation, you know,

2:25:22.940 --> 2:25:25.120
 that's how they teach in self defense here.

2:25:25.120 --> 2:25:26.120
 Never put your hands down.

2:25:26.120 --> 2:25:33.120
 Always hand there because I'm down or boom, like what this is, this is very important

2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:38.280
 and you never, you always your center line on the side like this.

2:25:38.280 --> 2:25:42.280
 If someone knows martial art, he will recognize that pattern.

2:25:42.280 --> 2:25:46.720
 But if you go like, if someone talked to you and you go like this, that's mean you're telling

2:25:46.720 --> 2:25:47.900
 the guy that you want to fight.

2:25:47.900 --> 2:25:48.900
 You don't want to do that.

2:25:48.900 --> 2:25:55.400
 You don't want to, oh yeah, you know, that's, that's the position because your hands are

2:25:55.400 --> 2:25:57.520
 here, you know, whatever you can do, you're here.

2:25:57.520 --> 2:26:01.280
 Well, also your ear tells a story.

2:26:01.280 --> 2:26:05.240
 It's not everybody that knows that, however, it's some people might think that it's my

2:26:05.240 --> 2:26:09.400
 mom grabbed me by the ear and pulled me because I didn't listen to her, you know.

2:26:09.400 --> 2:26:15.040
 A real fight in the street and a fight in mixed martial art is a different ball game.

2:26:15.040 --> 2:26:19.040
 What do you think is the best martial art to prepare you for street fighting?

2:26:19.040 --> 2:26:24.360
 You know, people often kind of have this discussion of Jiu Jitsu, maybe boxing, maybe wrestling.

2:26:24.360 --> 2:26:29.160
 Do you think, when you talk about a young person studying martial arts to prepare themselves?

2:26:29.160 --> 2:26:35.500
 For a street fight, it's often much different than a mixed martial art fight.

2:26:35.500 --> 2:26:40.040
 And I know there is a lot of BS in the world of martial art, like self defense stuff that

2:26:40.040 --> 2:26:50.360
 like, but I believe self defense is very important in a way to understand the situation, to understand

2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:57.920
 those situations that might occur, how to deal with it.

2:26:57.920 --> 2:27:04.540
 Because not necessarily that we talk about the technicality, we talk about the tacticality,

2:27:04.540 --> 2:27:09.520
 the tactics, you know, like when I'm talking to you about the element of surprise is important.

2:27:09.520 --> 2:27:15.760
 This is not technique, technique is a punch or techniques that I physically will use to

2:27:15.760 --> 2:27:20.280
 enable my opponent, my aggressor.

2:27:20.280 --> 2:27:24.240
 Tactic is the tactic I'm telling you about is in a street fight, if someone is looking

2:27:24.240 --> 2:27:28.760
 for trouble and I feel the heat rising as the conversation goes, that's the position

2:27:28.760 --> 2:27:32.320
 I'm going to take and I have to be first.

2:27:32.320 --> 2:27:34.700
 I cannot let him go first.

2:27:34.700 --> 2:27:36.660
 So I have to strike first or do something.

2:27:36.660 --> 2:27:45.040
 This is the first thing that generally I have to agree on.

2:27:45.040 --> 2:27:47.100
 After that, of course, there is the knowledge.

2:27:47.100 --> 2:27:51.580
 If you're a professional fighter, you have a huge advantage.

2:27:51.580 --> 2:27:53.760
 Once the fight is started, the war is declared.

2:27:53.760 --> 2:27:56.040
 Now it's everything goes.

2:27:56.040 --> 2:28:02.160
 But generally speaking, the person that will intervene, that will have the first blow or

2:28:02.160 --> 2:28:08.320
 the first, you know, the first punch will have a huge disadvantage.

2:28:08.320 --> 2:28:12.880
 It's like doing a hundred meter race and having a head start, you know, and that you can't

2:28:12.880 --> 2:28:14.920
 prepare for with any martial arts.

2:28:14.920 --> 2:28:15.920
 Yeah.

2:28:15.920 --> 2:28:17.720
 And if I'm a smart guy, I know how to fight.

2:28:17.720 --> 2:28:23.920
 If a guy like an heavyweight champion comes to me or like, like, like, you know, I know,

2:28:23.920 --> 2:28:32.120
 I know what to do to disable him, like boom or here or the neck, you know, like, and if

2:28:32.120 --> 2:28:33.720
 you blind him, what is he going to do?

2:28:33.720 --> 2:28:34.720
 You know what I mean?

2:28:34.720 --> 2:28:37.880
 So, so or a bottle, you know what I mean?

2:28:37.880 --> 2:28:40.840
 So the element of surprise is it's everything.

2:28:40.840 --> 2:28:45.760
 So that's why it's always, always good to be the nice guy and not looking for trouble.

2:28:45.760 --> 2:28:48.960
 Because if you're not looking for trouble, you have the head start, you have the option

2:28:48.960 --> 2:28:50.580
 of having a head start.

2:28:50.580 --> 2:28:54.440
 So what you're saying is being a nice guy is the best form of self defense, maybe a

2:28:54.440 --> 2:28:55.440
 little humor.

2:28:55.440 --> 2:28:56.440
 Yes.

2:28:56.440 --> 2:29:01.840
 And you know, I have learned that I've learned that when I was a kid, I was about maybe

2:29:01.840 --> 2:29:04.520
 seven or six, six years old.

2:29:04.520 --> 2:29:08.880
 We used to play in Montreal, there's a lot of snow, we used to play king of the mountain.

2:29:08.880 --> 2:29:09.880
 Yeah.

2:29:09.880 --> 2:29:13.540
 That's the first combat lesson that I've learned in my life.

2:29:13.540 --> 2:29:17.160
 And I managed somehow, it was a lot of kids, I managed to get on the top of the mountain

2:29:17.160 --> 2:29:22.160
 and another guy came in, come in on top of the mountain and he was angry that before

2:29:22.160 --> 2:29:24.760
 I was there before him.

2:29:24.760 --> 2:29:29.140
 When you play king of the mountain, it was a mountain of snow.

2:29:29.140 --> 2:29:32.160
 You don't strike each other, we just wrestle and push.

2:29:32.160 --> 2:29:33.160
 And I managed to be first.

2:29:33.160 --> 2:29:38.960
 And when he came, he says to me, say, OK, you want to, you want to fight?

2:29:38.960 --> 2:29:43.160
 And I said, yeah, I don't know what he means, like I want to fight, I want to wrestle.

2:29:43.160 --> 2:29:45.020
 I say, yes.

2:29:45.020 --> 2:29:46.840
 He punched me right in the face.

2:29:46.840 --> 2:29:47.840
 Boom.

2:29:47.840 --> 2:29:51.320
 And then I and then I fall on the bottom of the mountain.

2:29:51.320 --> 2:29:57.840
 Then when I fall down, I remember that vision in my life because it's I will remember that

2:29:57.840 --> 2:29:59.320
 for the rest of my life.

2:29:59.320 --> 2:30:03.640
 I'm about to stand up and I see the blood coming out of my nose, I see that the snow

2:30:03.640 --> 2:30:06.800
 is red because my nose is bleeding.

2:30:06.800 --> 2:30:11.360
 Now I remember the element of surprises, everything.

2:30:11.360 --> 2:30:13.640
 My first street fight, I lost it.

2:30:13.640 --> 2:30:19.500
 I got I didn't get knocked out, but I got dropped on the bottom of the snow mountain.

2:30:19.500 --> 2:30:25.040
 And I was like, oh, you got me because I wasn't expecting my hand, I was not expecting a punch.

2:30:25.040 --> 2:30:31.400
 So from there, when I felt the heat of an injury, an argument or something was not right,

2:30:31.400 --> 2:30:33.320
 I always stroke first.

2:30:33.320 --> 2:30:39.240
 I didn't win all my fight because sometimes there were more than one guys on me, you know.

2:30:39.240 --> 2:30:43.940
 But I think it's important to not be the aggressor.

2:30:43.940 --> 2:30:47.560
 So you have the element of surprise and always use that in your favor.

2:30:47.560 --> 2:30:48.560
 That's so brilliant.

2:30:48.560 --> 2:30:54.840
 Let me go from the very practical to the most impractically huge question about the meaning

2:30:54.840 --> 2:30:56.000
 of life.

2:30:56.000 --> 2:31:03.160
 You said that when great depths of unrelenting sorrow are punctuated by great peaks of joy

2:31:03.160 --> 2:31:07.740
 and liberation, the result is delicious.

2:31:07.740 --> 2:31:13.840
 So what do you think is the meaning of this whole journey that we're on this life?

2:31:13.840 --> 2:31:16.400
 What makes life delicious?

2:31:16.400 --> 2:31:23.200
 To me, you know, satisfaction is the M for me.

2:31:23.200 --> 2:31:30.160
 Like I always, if I'm satisfied, that means I have nothing to live for.

2:31:30.160 --> 2:31:33.680
 I'm not talking only about my career, I'm talking about my life.

2:31:33.680 --> 2:31:35.400
 What do you want in your life?

2:31:35.400 --> 2:31:37.960
 You want kids, you want a family, you want to be champion.

2:31:37.960 --> 2:31:38.960
 What do you want in your life?

2:31:38.960 --> 2:31:45.000
 You have like a long term goal, short term goal.

2:31:45.000 --> 2:31:48.520
 In mixed martial arts, I achieve what I needed to achieve.

2:31:48.520 --> 2:31:50.400
 I'm satisfied.

2:31:50.400 --> 2:31:54.440
 I'm no longer the same George St. Pierre than when I was begging for a title shot on my

2:31:54.440 --> 2:31:55.760
 knees.

2:31:55.760 --> 2:31:59.320
 I move on from it.

2:31:59.320 --> 2:32:02.400
 Now I had a chance to go into movies.

2:32:02.400 --> 2:32:14.040
 Now that same insane drive that I had to be the champion in the world, now I put it into

2:32:14.040 --> 2:32:15.040
 acting.

2:32:15.040 --> 2:32:20.480
 Like I'm having a lot of acting class now and luckily for me, the timing was amazing.

2:32:20.480 --> 2:32:26.480
 I got cast for the Falcon and the Winter Soldier that is on Disney Plus channel.

2:32:26.480 --> 2:32:34.840
 It's a huge, huge project to be part of for me because it's like you play basketball,

2:32:34.840 --> 2:32:37.080
 you have a chance to go for the NBA right away.

2:32:37.080 --> 2:32:38.760
 I was very lucky.

2:32:38.760 --> 2:32:41.360
 The timing was just too perfect.

2:32:41.360 --> 2:32:48.160
 And so you need to constantly challenging yourself and having goals to achieve, you

2:32:48.160 --> 2:32:49.160
 know, like that.

2:32:49.160 --> 2:32:53.920
 Keep your brain activated, like keep working.

2:32:53.920 --> 2:33:00.720
 And the proof of that is that you see sometimes some old people, like when they retire, very

2:33:00.720 --> 2:33:08.040
 often sometime you see that they got sick and they die or because they it's either because

2:33:08.040 --> 2:33:18.720
 sometimes we think we we certainly may benefit, we do something good for them by making that

2:33:18.720 --> 2:33:20.200
 work and giving them a break.

2:33:20.200 --> 2:33:23.880
 So in our mind, we're like, oh, he's going to be able to relax.

2:33:23.880 --> 2:33:26.960
 But in their mind, it's not good because they're not busy.

2:33:26.960 --> 2:33:28.080
 They have nothing to live for.

2:33:28.080 --> 2:33:32.920
 Like my dad is used to work all the time and he has always something to do.

2:33:32.920 --> 2:33:34.880
 He's retired now.

2:33:34.880 --> 2:33:39.440
 I myself now call him by force to find him some job.

2:33:39.440 --> 2:33:42.480
 Hey, dad, can you come in my house?

2:33:42.480 --> 2:33:44.040
 Have this thing to repair?

2:33:44.040 --> 2:33:45.040
 I don't know how to do it.

2:33:45.040 --> 2:33:50.040
 So it gives him it gives him a reason not to live on because he has other things to

2:33:50.040 --> 2:33:51.040
 do.

2:33:51.040 --> 2:33:58.040
 But but what I mean is also in life, I think you always don't be afraid to aim high.

2:33:58.040 --> 2:34:03.560
 Don't don't be afraid to fix your objective very high and never be able to reach it.

2:34:03.560 --> 2:34:06.000
 Be afraid of reaching your goals, essentially.

2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:08.320
 I mean, you always have to keep moving it out.

2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:13.040
 You think there's a it's an interesting question because you've been acting in some really

2:34:13.040 --> 2:34:14.680
 exciting things.

2:34:14.680 --> 2:34:21.580
 Do you think there's a dramatic role where it's basically, you know, you go full Robert

2:34:21.580 --> 2:34:24.600
 De Niro in Taxi Driver?

2:34:24.600 --> 2:34:28.080
 Do you think there'll be a full length feature film with George St. Pierre?

2:34:28.080 --> 2:34:31.880
 I liken there is level to this thing.

2:34:31.880 --> 2:34:35.720
 Am I aware that I have to restart as a white belt white belt?

2:34:35.720 --> 2:34:38.480
 And for some people, it could be discouraging.

2:34:38.480 --> 2:34:39.760
 But for me, man, it's great.

2:34:39.760 --> 2:34:40.960
 I love it.

2:34:40.960 --> 2:34:41.960
 I freaking love it.

2:34:41.960 --> 2:34:47.460
 I embrace it because everybody told me like I would never be able to do it and it's fine.

2:34:47.460 --> 2:34:55.200
 But the and also the outcome of a failure in the sport of mixed martial art is much

2:34:55.200 --> 2:35:01.680
 more serious than the outcome of a failure for a movie, for example, for for if you think

2:35:01.680 --> 2:35:05.480
 when you should zag in a fight, you get knocked out if you zig when you should zag and on

2:35:05.480 --> 2:35:06.480
 set.

2:35:06.480 --> 2:35:07.480
 Oh, cut.

2:35:07.480 --> 2:35:09.080
 We'll do it again.

2:35:09.080 --> 2:35:18.240
 And I know that I will be most likely be to chosen for action martial art roles because

2:35:18.240 --> 2:35:19.960
 that's my background.

2:35:19.960 --> 2:35:24.840
 There's this new trend in Hollywood now when they want someone to play an Italian guy,

2:35:24.840 --> 2:35:27.960
 they're going to choose a real Italian person.

2:35:27.960 --> 2:35:31.200
 When they want someone to play a Russian guy, they're going to choose someone who has a

2:35:31.200 --> 2:35:33.320
 real Russian background.

2:35:33.320 --> 2:35:36.600
 Now they want a real martial art fighter.

2:35:36.600 --> 2:35:38.240
 I've done fighting all my life.

2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:41.440
 I just need to improve my acting skill.

2:35:41.440 --> 2:35:46.200
 But when I train in acting, I get myself out of my comfort zone.

2:35:46.200 --> 2:35:48.400
 I'm not playing a role of a martial art guy.

2:35:48.400 --> 2:35:52.600
 I'm playing like romance, comedy, drama.

2:35:52.600 --> 2:36:00.320
 So when I go on set and playing the role of a badass martial art guy, it's it's easier.

2:36:00.320 --> 2:36:07.080
 So like in training for a fight, I always make my preparation harder than the actual

2:36:07.080 --> 2:36:08.640
 task.

2:36:08.640 --> 2:36:13.040
 I would love to see where I don't know if you've seen the wrestler with Mickey Rourke.

2:36:13.040 --> 2:36:14.040
 Oh, yeah.

2:36:14.040 --> 2:36:15.040
 Those types of films.

2:36:15.040 --> 2:36:19.400
 I would love to I would love to you do something like that.

2:36:19.400 --> 2:36:23.920
 If not now, then in 10, 20 years, I could see that that would be amazing.

2:36:23.920 --> 2:36:25.480
 It's levels to the game, right?

2:36:25.480 --> 2:36:26.480
 Yes, it's gradual.

2:36:26.480 --> 2:36:31.080
 And I don't and I'm aware that I don't want to take something on my shoulder that I won't

2:36:31.080 --> 2:36:32.600
 be able to deliver.

2:36:32.600 --> 2:36:35.440
 It's like a fighter wants to go for a title shot right away.

2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:41.360
 It could very well break him, you know, and I don't want to do that because I know I've

2:36:41.360 --> 2:36:47.360
 done some gigs in the past, but I was not focusing on it because I was focusing on competing

2:36:47.360 --> 2:36:52.080
 as a martial art martial artist in competition in MMA.

2:36:52.080 --> 2:36:53.680
 But now I take it very seriously.

2:36:53.680 --> 2:36:57.040
 So I cannot do the same mistake again because I've done some stuff.

2:36:57.040 --> 2:37:00.160
 I've done it for the money and it was good.

2:37:00.160 --> 2:37:04.540
 It was fun to be beat up by Jacque Van Damme, Steven Seagal and everything.

2:37:04.540 --> 2:37:08.660
 But my acting was not on point, you know, at that time.

2:37:08.660 --> 2:37:14.040
 So if I ever every time I'm going to come back from now on, on screen, you need to be

2:37:14.040 --> 2:37:16.360
 sharp because you cannot mess it up.

2:37:16.360 --> 2:37:19.440
 If you mess it up, it's like a loss on your record.

2:37:19.440 --> 2:37:21.400
 You're not taken seriously.

2:37:21.400 --> 2:37:23.280
 So so that's how I see it.

2:37:23.280 --> 2:37:29.960
 And it's very fun because I had a chance to talk to a lot of guys on top of all the class

2:37:29.960 --> 2:37:31.520
 that I'm having.

2:37:31.520 --> 2:37:36.040
 Like a few days ago, I was with Danny Trujo.

2:37:36.040 --> 2:37:41.040
 And I always seek the advice of actors when I when I see some of them that because I really

2:37:41.040 --> 2:37:44.120
 admire how they do, you know, how they project their emotion.

2:37:44.120 --> 2:37:48.960
 And I asked him, Danny Trujo, I said, I said to him, he's an amazing guy, by the way.

2:37:48.960 --> 2:37:50.460
 Very nice guy.

2:37:50.460 --> 2:37:55.440
 And I asked him, I say, how how do you do to be?

2:37:55.440 --> 2:37:57.800
 Because you scared the hell out of me.

2:37:57.800 --> 2:38:00.900
 How do you do to be so scary?

2:38:00.900 --> 2:38:03.000
 Like what is your trick?

2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:08.000
 And he tells me, he's like, George, if you're threatening, if you're threatening someone

2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:12.320
 and you scream at him, I'm going to kill you.

2:38:12.320 --> 2:38:19.880
 It's not as scary if you're smiling and you say, I'm going to kill you like and he says

2:38:19.880 --> 2:38:26.600
 also to me that another advice he gave me is like when you say this, think about you

2:38:26.600 --> 2:38:31.160
 killing him for real, that how you hate him and how you're going to kill him.

2:38:31.160 --> 2:38:35.200
 So the camera will take the emotion out.

2:38:35.200 --> 2:38:36.960
 Don't try physically to do that.

2:38:36.960 --> 2:38:38.800
 That's the mistake I used to do before.

2:38:38.800 --> 2:38:44.240
 I used to physically show that I'm strong and angry and to be mean.

2:38:44.240 --> 2:38:49.920
 So these are just an example of tricks that I learned sometimes when I met an actor.

2:38:49.920 --> 2:38:53.260
 I always try to learn from everybody that I met in my life.

2:38:53.260 --> 2:38:57.120
 It's a difficult journey because then you have to go to some dark places as a person

2:38:57.120 --> 2:39:01.360
 because you really have to imagine imagine some dark things.

2:39:01.360 --> 2:39:02.720
 It's fascinating, actually.

2:39:02.720 --> 2:39:09.400
 I think a lot of the actors, they have sometimes problems because of that, because now I understand

2:39:09.400 --> 2:39:13.880
 why it's like if you work on your bicep, your bicep will grow.

2:39:13.880 --> 2:39:14.880
 Right.

2:39:14.880 --> 2:39:20.240
 It's because it is the stress that you put on it that will make it grow.

2:39:20.240 --> 2:39:21.240
 Right.

2:39:21.240 --> 2:39:23.240
 Emotions are, I believe, are the same way.

2:39:23.240 --> 2:39:32.200
 If you used to dig inside of you down deep to to to to make your negative emotion, depressive

2:39:32.200 --> 2:39:39.240
 emotion comes out, if something bad in your life happened, you will fall into those emotion

2:39:39.240 --> 2:39:43.480
 much more rapidly than someone who does not that every day.

2:39:43.480 --> 2:39:44.480
 You know what I mean?

2:39:44.480 --> 2:39:45.480
 Because it will.

2:39:45.480 --> 2:39:46.480
 It's like a muscle memory.

2:39:46.480 --> 2:39:51.640
 Like if you program yourself to react a certain way, you will reach that point very often.

2:39:51.640 --> 2:39:56.800
 So that's why sometimes you see some some guys that we often blame it on drugs.

2:39:56.800 --> 2:40:02.200
 But I think it's also because of the acting that I used to be so hot on the hot tub and

2:40:02.200 --> 2:40:07.760
 sometimes they go to the down deep so they they they they they the boat extreme, you

2:40:07.760 --> 2:40:08.760
 know.

2:40:08.760 --> 2:40:09.760
 You got to be psychologically tough.

2:40:09.760 --> 2:40:10.760
 And that's life.

2:40:10.760 --> 2:40:14.280
 So I'm so excited to see you challenge yourself in that direction.

2:40:14.280 --> 2:40:18.260
 That's one thing that I'm a little bit afraid.

2:40:18.260 --> 2:40:19.260
 That happened to me.

2:40:19.260 --> 2:40:26.000
 I really hope I'll always be, you know, like a problem, having a problem to control my

2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:29.040
 emotion be too much extreme.

2:40:29.040 --> 2:40:31.200
 I hope it does not happen to me.

2:40:31.200 --> 2:40:39.800
 And if I feel that I'm going towards that, I'm going to, you know, give up on my new

2:40:39.800 --> 2:40:43.800
 objective and find something else to to achieve.

2:40:43.800 --> 2:40:46.520
 But in your personal life, you want to be real with your emotions.

2:40:46.520 --> 2:40:47.720
 You don't want to.

2:40:47.720 --> 2:40:52.600
 It doesn't, you know, just like with biceps, you don't want biceps that are too big.

2:40:52.600 --> 2:40:56.720
 You are real, but you are extreme real.

2:40:56.720 --> 2:41:02.120
 And that's the that's the that's what I think something that could happen to actors sometimes

2:41:02.120 --> 2:41:04.360
 when they go too much into their emotion.

2:41:04.360 --> 2:41:09.400
 Like we talk about like something guys that that that commit commit suicide, perhaps,

2:41:09.400 --> 2:41:10.400
 you know, I don't know.

2:41:10.400 --> 2:41:15.400
 It's because I don't know their real life, but it could be something that they get so

2:41:15.400 --> 2:41:17.160
 much into their character.

2:41:17.160 --> 2:41:20.840
 I didn't understand it at first because I never had acting class.

2:41:20.840 --> 2:41:25.240
 But after a while that you have acting class, now you start to realize that, yeah, I understand

2:41:25.240 --> 2:41:32.140
 why some actor get caught up in their emotion, because that can have an influence on their

2:41:32.140 --> 2:41:33.140
 life.

2:41:33.140 --> 2:41:34.140
 Right.

2:41:34.140 --> 2:41:36.960
 You're on a fascinating journey, George.

2:41:36.960 --> 2:41:41.040
 I can't tell you how much it means to me that you'll be so nice to me, that you'll give

2:41:41.040 --> 2:41:42.520
 me so much respect.

2:41:42.520 --> 2:41:46.240
 Just that that tells everything I need to know about you as a human being with everything

2:41:46.240 --> 2:41:47.720
 you've accomplished.

2:41:47.720 --> 2:41:53.080
 You waste all your time and you're so nice to me just as a fellow human being, man.

2:41:53.080 --> 2:41:57.660
 I have so much respect from so honored and the energy you give me by just even showing

2:41:57.660 --> 2:41:58.660
 up here.

2:41:58.660 --> 2:42:00.920
 I'll carry that forward for a long time to come, George.

2:42:00.920 --> 2:42:01.920
 I love it.

2:42:01.920 --> 2:42:02.920
 Thank you so much for talking to me.

2:42:02.920 --> 2:42:05.040
 Now, thank you, Lex, for having me on the show.

2:42:05.040 --> 2:42:07.920
 You know, I've been looking to talk to you for a long time.

2:42:07.920 --> 2:42:12.800
 For me, talking to a guy like you, it's it's a great learning experience because I always

2:42:12.800 --> 2:42:13.800
 learn.

2:42:13.800 --> 2:42:16.680
 And it's life is fascinating to me.

2:42:16.680 --> 2:42:21.840
 And all the experience that we have in life, you know, it's something that can make us

2:42:21.840 --> 2:42:22.840
 grow.

2:42:22.840 --> 2:42:26.720
 And this experience for me just, you know, make me grow as as well.

2:42:26.720 --> 2:42:27.720
 You know?

2:42:27.720 --> 2:42:28.720
 Plus, we look pretty damn sharp today.

2:42:28.720 --> 2:42:29.720
 So.

2:42:29.720 --> 2:42:30.720
 Man in black, my friend.

2:42:30.720 --> 2:42:31.720
 Man in black.

2:42:31.720 --> 2:42:32.720
 Thanks, George.

2:42:32.720 --> 2:42:35.320
 Nice.

2:42:35.320 --> 2:42:38.200

 And now let me leave you with some words from Miyamoto Musashi.

2:42:53.640 --> 2:42:57.640
 Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.

2:42:57.640 --> 2:43:08.920
