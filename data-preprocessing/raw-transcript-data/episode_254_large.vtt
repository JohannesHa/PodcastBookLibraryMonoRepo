00:00.000 --> 00:02.900
 The following is a conversation with Jay Bhattacharya,

00:02.900 --> 00:06.100
 Professor of Medicine, Health Policy and Economics

00:06.100 --> 00:08.180
 at Stanford University.

00:08.180 --> 00:11.400
 Please allow me to say a few words about lockdowns

00:11.400 --> 00:14.380
 and the blinding, destructive effects of arrogance

00:14.380 --> 00:19.380
 on leadership, especially in the space of policy and politics.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.780
 Jay Bhattacharya is the coauthor

00:21.780 --> 00:24.460
 of the now famous Great Barrington Declaration,

00:24.460 --> 00:27.860
 a one page document that in October 2020

00:27.860 --> 00:32.000
 made a case against the effectiveness of lockdowns.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.600
 Most of this podcast conversation

00:33.600 --> 00:36.360
 is about the ideas related to this document.

00:36.360 --> 00:40.240
 And so let me say a few things here about what troubles me.

00:41.580 --> 00:44.480
 Those who advocate for lockdowns as a policy

00:44.480 --> 00:47.340
 often ignore the quiet suffering of millions

00:47.340 --> 00:50.180
 that it results in, which includes economic pain,

00:50.180 --> 00:52.580
 loss of jobs that give meaning and pride

00:52.580 --> 00:55.760
 in the face of uncertainty, the increase in suicide

00:55.760 --> 00:58.560
 and suicidal ideation, and in general,

00:58.560 --> 01:02.360
 the fear and anger that arises from the powerlessness

01:02.360 --> 01:04.200
 forced onto the populace

01:04.200 --> 01:07.060
 by the self proclaimed elites and experts.

01:08.140 --> 01:11.600
 Many folks whose job is unaffected by the lockdowns

01:11.600 --> 01:14.040
 talk down to the masses about which path forward

01:14.040 --> 01:16.600
 is right and which is wrong.

01:16.600 --> 01:20.040
 What troubles me most is this very lack of empathy

01:20.040 --> 01:22.880
 among the policymakers for the common man

01:22.880 --> 01:26.280
 and in general for people unlike themselves.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.580
 The landscape of suffering is vast

01:28.580 --> 01:30.220
 and must be fully considered

01:30.220 --> 01:33.220
 in calculating the response to the pandemic

01:33.220 --> 01:36.300
 with humility and with rigorous,

01:36.300 --> 01:39.300
 open minded scientific debate.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.100
 Jay and I talk about the email from Francis Collins

01:42.100 --> 01:46.440
 to Anthony Fauci that called Jay and his two coauthors

01:46.440 --> 01:49.640
 fringe epidemiologists and also called

01:49.640 --> 01:53.240
 for a devastating published take down of their ideas.

01:53.240 --> 01:57.140
 These words from Francis broke my heart.

01:57.140 --> 02:00.760
 I understand them, I can even steel man them,

02:00.760 --> 02:02.960
 but nevertheless, on balance,

02:02.960 --> 02:06.720
 they show to me a failure of leadership.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.100
 Leadership in a pandemic is hard,

02:09.100 --> 02:12.660
 which is why great leaders are remembered by history.

02:12.660 --> 02:17.660
 They are rare, they stand out and they give me hope.

02:17.660 --> 02:21.620
 Also, this whole mess inspires me

02:21.620 --> 02:24.700
 on my small individual level to do the right thing

02:24.700 --> 02:28.240
 in the face of conformity, despite the long odds.

02:29.500 --> 02:31.460
 I talked to Francis Collins,

02:31.460 --> 02:34.200
 I talked to Albert Burla, Pfizer CEO.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.580
 I also talked and will continue to talk

02:36.580 --> 02:39.840
 with people like Jay and other dissenting voices

02:39.840 --> 02:42.040
 that challenge the mainstream narratives

02:42.040 --> 02:43.820
 and those in the seats of power.

02:43.820 --> 02:46.900
 I hope to highlight both the strengths and weaknesses

02:46.900 --> 02:49.660
 in their ideas with respect and empathy,

02:49.660 --> 02:52.240
 but also with guts and skill.

02:53.200 --> 02:56.840
 The skill part, I hope to improve on over time.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.780
 And I do believe that conversation

02:59.780 --> 03:02.520
 and an open mind is the way out of this.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.020
 And finally, as I've said in the past,

03:06.020 --> 03:10.420
 I value love and integrity far, far above money,

03:10.420 --> 03:12.020
 fame and power.

03:12.020 --> 03:15.120
 Those latter three are all ephemeral.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.000
 They slip through the fingers of anyone

03:17.000 --> 03:19.960
 who tries to hold on and leave behind

03:19.960 --> 03:22.460
 an empty shell of a human being.

03:23.460 --> 03:26.240
 I prefer to die a man who lived by principles

03:26.240 --> 03:28.700
 that nobody could shake and a man

03:28.700 --> 03:30.800
 who added a bit of love to the world.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.980
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

03:33.980 --> 03:36.440
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

03:36.440 --> 03:37.640
 in the description.

03:37.640 --> 03:42.180
 And now, here's my conversation with Jay Bhattacharya.

03:43.860 --> 03:48.460
 To our best understanding today, how deadly is COVID?

03:48.460 --> 03:52.660
 Do we have a good measure for this very question?

03:52.660 --> 03:56.100
 So the best evidence for COVID, the deadliness of COVID,

03:56.100 --> 04:00.040
 comes from a whole series of seroprevalence studies.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.540
 Seroprevalence studies are these studies

04:01.540 --> 04:04.800
 of antibody prevalence in the population at large.

04:04.800 --> 04:08.940
 I was part of the very first set of seroprevalence studies,

04:08.940 --> 04:10.940
 one in Santa Clara County, one in L.A. County,

04:10.940 --> 04:14.240
 and one with Major League Baseball around the U.S.

04:14.240 --> 04:16.140
 If I may just pause you for a second.

04:17.180 --> 04:20.720
 If people don't know what serology is and seroprevalence,

04:20.720 --> 04:23.080
 it does sound like you say zero prevalence.

04:23.080 --> 04:26.020
 It's not, it's sero and serology is antibodies.

04:26.020 --> 04:29.920
 So it's a survey that counts the number of antibodies.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.220
 Specific to COVID, yes.

04:31.220 --> 04:34.900
 People that have antibodies specific to COVID,

04:34.900 --> 04:37.060
 which perhaps shows an indication

04:37.060 --> 04:39.160
 that they likely have had COVID,

04:39.160 --> 04:41.700
 and therefore this is a way to study

04:41.700 --> 04:43.160
 how many people in the population

04:43.160 --> 04:45.440
 have been exposed to or have had COVID.

04:45.440 --> 04:46.840
 Exactly, yeah, exactly.

04:46.840 --> 04:51.840
 So the idea is that we don't know

04:51.840 --> 04:53.520
 exactly the number of people with COVID

04:53.520 --> 04:54.920
 just by counting the people

04:54.920 --> 04:57.780
 that present themselves with symptoms of COVID.

04:57.780 --> 05:01.760
 COVID has, it turns out, a very wide range of symptoms,

05:01.760 --> 05:04.160
 ranging from no symptoms at all

05:04.160 --> 05:05.920
 to this deadly viral pneumonia

05:05.920 --> 05:07.500
 that has killed so many people.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.460
 And the problem is, if you just count the number of cases,

05:10.460 --> 05:12.340
 the people who have very few symptoms

05:12.340 --> 05:15.040
 often don't show up for testing.

05:15.040 --> 05:18.200
 They're outside of the can of public health.

05:18.200 --> 05:21.980
 And so it's really hard to know the answer to your question

05:21.980 --> 05:24.240
 without understanding how many people are infected,

05:24.240 --> 05:26.380
 because you can probably tell the number of deaths,

05:26.380 --> 05:28.320
 even though there's some controversy over that.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.320
 But that, so the numerator is possible,

05:31.320 --> 05:33.060
 but the denominator is much harder.

05:33.060 --> 05:35.060
 How much controversy is there about the death?

05:35.060 --> 05:36.900
 We're gonna go on a million tangents.

05:36.900 --> 05:40.100
 Is that, okay, we're gonna, I have a million questions.

05:40.100 --> 05:43.500
 So one, I love data so much,

05:43.500 --> 05:45.460
 but I'm like almost tuned out

05:45.460 --> 05:47.400
 paying attention to COVID data,

05:47.400 --> 05:49.900
 because I feel like I'm walking on shaky ground.

05:49.900 --> 05:52.140
 I don't know who to trust.

05:52.140 --> 05:54.400
 Maybe you can comment on different sources of data,

05:54.400 --> 05:55.980
 different kinds of data.

05:55.980 --> 05:59.140
 The death one, that seems like a really important one.

05:59.140 --> 06:03.220
 Can we trust the reported deaths associated with COVID,

06:03.220 --> 06:06.020
 or is it just a giant, messy thing that mixed up?

06:06.020 --> 06:09.600
 And then there's this kind of stories about hospitals

06:09.600 --> 06:14.300
 being incentivized to report a death as COVID death.

06:14.300 --> 06:16.440
 So there's some truth in some of that.

06:16.440 --> 06:19.060
 Let me just talk about the incentives.

06:19.060 --> 06:23.200
 So in the United States, we passed this CARES Act

06:23.200 --> 06:26.400
 that was aimed at making sure hospital systems

06:26.400 --> 06:29.480
 didn't go bankrupt in the early days of the pandemic.

06:29.480 --> 06:30.420
 The couple of things they did,

06:30.420 --> 06:34.620
 one was they provided incentives to treat COVID patients,

06:34.620 --> 06:38.780
 tens of thousands of dollars extra per COVID patient.

06:38.780 --> 06:41.780
 And the other thing they did is they gave a 20% bump

06:41.780 --> 06:43.560
 to Medicare payments for elderly patients

06:43.560 --> 06:44.420
 who are treated with COVID.

06:44.420 --> 06:46.360
 The idea is that there's more expensive to treat them

06:46.360 --> 06:48.320
 at the early days.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.500
 So that did provide an incentive

06:49.500 --> 06:52.540
 to sort of have a lot of COVID patients in the hospital,

06:52.540 --> 06:55.900
 because your financial success of the hospital,

06:55.900 --> 06:57.900
 or at least not lack of financial ruin

06:57.900 --> 07:00.620
 depended on having many COVID patients.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.140
 The other thing on the death certificates

07:02.140 --> 07:04.100
 is that reporting of deaths is a separate issue.

07:04.100 --> 07:06.540
 I don't know that there's a financial incentive there,

07:06.540 --> 07:08.900
 but there is this sort of like complicated,

07:08.900 --> 07:11.240
 you know, when you fill out a death certificate

07:11.240 --> 07:13.940
 for a patient with a lot of conditions,

07:13.940 --> 07:15.380
 like let's say a patient has diabetes,

07:15.380 --> 07:17.620
 a patient that, well, that diabetes could lead

07:17.620 --> 07:20.020
 to heart failure.

07:20.020 --> 07:22.080
 You know, you have a heart attack, heart failure,

07:22.080 --> 07:26.420
 your lungs fill up, then you get COVID and you die.

07:26.420 --> 07:28.200
 So what do you write on the death certificate?

07:28.200 --> 07:29.540
 Was it COVID that killed you?

07:29.540 --> 07:31.220
 Was it the lungs filling up?

07:31.220 --> 07:32.860
 Was it the heart failure?

07:32.860 --> 07:34.060
 Was it the diabetes?

07:34.060 --> 07:36.760
 It's really difficult to like disentangle.

07:37.660 --> 07:40.160
 And I think a lot of times what's happened

07:40.160 --> 07:42.020
 is that people have like erred

07:42.020 --> 07:44.860
 on the side of signing it as COVID.

07:44.860 --> 07:46.140
 Now, what's the evidence of this?

07:46.140 --> 07:49.640
 There's been a couple of audits of death certificates

07:49.640 --> 07:51.060
 in places like Santa Clara County,

07:51.060 --> 07:54.260
 where I live, in Alameda County, California,

07:54.260 --> 07:56.540
 where they carefully went through the death certificate

07:56.540 --> 07:57.940
 and said, okay, is this reasonable to say

07:57.940 --> 08:00.860
 this was actually COVID or it was COVID incidental?

08:00.860 --> 08:03.780
 And they found that about 25%, 20, 25% of the deaths

08:03.780 --> 08:08.380
 were more likely incidental than directly due to COVID.

08:08.380 --> 08:10.440
 I personally don't get too excited about this.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.260
 I mean, it's a philosophical question, right?

08:12.260 --> 08:14.980
 Like ultimately, what kills you?

08:16.180 --> 08:19.380
 Which is an odd thing to say if you're not in medicine,

08:19.380 --> 08:23.340
 but like really, it's almost always multifactorial.

08:23.340 --> 08:25.140
 It's not always just the bus hits you.

08:25.140 --> 08:27.180
 The bus hits you, you get a brain bleed.

08:27.180 --> 08:28.700
 Was it the brain bleed that killed you?

08:28.700 --> 08:29.620
 Would it have burst anyway?

08:29.620 --> 08:32.440
 I mean, you know, the bus hits you, killed you, right?

08:32.440 --> 08:34.120
 The way you die is a philosophical question,

08:34.120 --> 08:36.820
 but it's also a sociological and psychological question

08:36.820 --> 08:40.360
 because it seems like every single person

08:40.360 --> 08:43.140
 who has passed away over the past couple of years,

08:43.140 --> 08:44.980
 kind of the first question that comes to mind.

08:44.980 --> 08:45.820
 Was it COVID?

08:45.820 --> 08:46.640
 Was it COVID?

08:46.640 --> 08:48.380
 Not just because you're trying to be political,

08:48.380 --> 08:49.380
 but just in your mind.

08:49.380 --> 08:51.900
 No, I think there's a psychological reason for this, right?

08:51.900 --> 08:55.520
 So, you know, we spent the better part

08:55.520 --> 08:57.700
 of at least a half century in the United States

08:57.700 --> 09:01.700
 not worried too much about infectious diseases.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.820
 The notion was we essentially conquered them.

09:03.820 --> 09:04.780
 It was something that happens

09:04.780 --> 09:06.960
 in far away places to other people.

09:07.820 --> 09:10.000
 And that's true for much of the developed world.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.940
 Life expectancy were going up for decades and decades.

09:13.940 --> 09:16.080
 And for the first time in living memory,

09:16.080 --> 09:18.340
 we have a disease that can kill us.

09:18.340 --> 09:21.300
 I mean, I think we're effectively evolved to fear that,

09:21.300 --> 09:23.380
 like the panic centers of our brain,

09:23.380 --> 09:26.020
 the lizard part of our brain takes over.

09:26.020 --> 09:29.940
 And our central focus has been avoiding this one risk.

09:29.940 --> 09:32.400
 And so it's not surprising that people,

09:32.400 --> 09:33.900
 when they're filling out death certificates

09:33.900 --> 09:36.580
 or thinking about what led to the death,

09:36.580 --> 09:38.980
 this most salient thing that's in the front

09:38.980 --> 09:41.200
 of everyone's brain would jump to the top.

09:41.200 --> 09:46.200
 And we can't ignore this very deep psychological thing

09:46.840 --> 09:51.000
 when we consider what people say on the internet,

09:51.000 --> 09:52.320
 what people say to each other,

09:52.320 --> 09:55.720
 what people write in scientific papers, everything.

09:55.720 --> 10:00.720
 It feels like when COVID has been brought onto this world,

10:05.160 --> 10:09.320
 everything changed in the way people feel about each other,

10:09.320 --> 10:11.760
 just the way they communicate with each other.

10:11.760 --> 10:15.820
 I think the level of emotion involved,

10:15.820 --> 10:19.420
 I think in many people, it brought out the worst in them.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.200
 For sometimes short periods of time

10:22.200 --> 10:24.200
 and sometimes it was always therapeutic,

10:24.200 --> 10:25.520
 like you were waiting to get out

10:25.520 --> 10:27.720
 like the darkest parts of you,

10:27.720 --> 10:30.240
 just to say, if you're angry at something in this world,

10:30.240 --> 10:31.740
 I'm going to say it now.

10:31.740 --> 10:34.040
 And I think that's probably talking

10:34.040 --> 10:38.600
 to some deep primal thing that fear we have

10:38.600 --> 10:41.800
 for formalities of all different kinds.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.960
 And then when that fear is aroused

10:43.960 --> 10:46.000
 in all the deepest emotions,

10:46.000 --> 10:49.880
 it's like a Freudian psychotherapy session,

10:49.880 --> 10:51.200
 but across the world.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.800
 It's something that psychologists are going to have

10:53.800 --> 10:56.480
 a field day with for a generation trying to understand.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.160
 I mean, I think what you say is right,

10:59.160 --> 11:02.540
 but piled on top of that is also this sort of,

11:04.220 --> 11:05.960
 this impetus to empathy,

11:05.960 --> 11:08.640
 the empathized compassion toward others,

11:08.640 --> 11:11.320
 essentially militarized, right?

11:11.320 --> 11:16.320
 So I'm protecting you by some actions

11:16.520 --> 11:20.280
 and those actions, if I don't do them,

11:20.280 --> 11:21.120
 if you don't do them,

11:21.120 --> 11:24.400
 well, that must mean you hate me.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.400
 It's created this like social tension

11:26.400 --> 11:27.240
 that I've never seen before.

11:27.240 --> 11:30.960
 And we looked at each other

11:30.960 --> 11:35.620
 as if we were just simply sources of germs

11:35.620 --> 11:37.840
 rather than people to get to know,

11:37.840 --> 11:41.180
 people to enjoy, people to get to learn from.

11:41.180 --> 11:44.840
 It colored basically almost every human interaction

11:44.840 --> 11:47.200
 for every human on the planet.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.600
 Yeah, the basic common humanity.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.880
 It's like you can wear a mask,

11:50.880 --> 11:52.680
 you can stand far away,

11:52.680 --> 11:54.700
 but the love you have for each other

11:54.700 --> 11:56.200
 when you're looking into each other's eyes,

11:56.200 --> 11:59.920
 that was dissipating by region too.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.520
 I've experienced having traveled

12:01.520 --> 12:03.660
 quite a bit throughout this time.

12:03.660 --> 12:06.320
 It was really sad,

12:06.320 --> 12:08.360
 even people that are really close together,

12:08.360 --> 12:09.760
 just the way they stood,

12:09.760 --> 12:11.560
 the way they looked at each other.

12:11.560 --> 12:14.280
 And it made me feel for a moment

12:15.560 --> 12:17.400
 that the fabric that connects all of us

12:17.400 --> 12:20.000
 is more fragile than I thought.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.280
 I mean, if you walk down the street,

12:21.280 --> 12:23.200
 or if you ever, if you did this during COVID,

12:23.200 --> 12:24.400
 I'm sure you had this experience

12:24.400 --> 12:25.440
 where you walk down the street,

12:25.440 --> 12:26.400
 if you're not wearing a mask,

12:26.400 --> 12:27.700
 or even if you are,

12:27.700 --> 12:30.240
 people will jump off the sidewalk

12:30.240 --> 12:31.960
 that you walked past them,

12:31.960 --> 12:33.960
 as if you're poison,

12:33.960 --> 12:37.920
 even though the data are that COVID spreads

12:37.920 --> 12:39.040
 indifferently outdoors,

12:39.040 --> 12:41.440
 or if at all, really, outdoors.

12:41.440 --> 12:43.480
 But it's not simply a biological

12:43.480 --> 12:45.440
 or infectious disease phenomenon,

12:45.440 --> 12:46.280
 or epidemiological phenomenon.

12:46.280 --> 12:50.680
 It is a change in the way humans treated each other,

12:50.680 --> 12:52.840
 I hope temporary.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.840
 I do wanna say on the flip side of that,

12:54.840 --> 12:58.240
 so I was mostly in Boston, Massachusetts

12:58.240 --> 12:59.480
 when the pandemic broke out.

12:59.480 --> 13:01.440
 I think that's where I was, yeah.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.320
 And then I came here to Austin, Texas

13:04.320 --> 13:07.560
 to visit my now good friend, Joe Rogan,

13:07.560 --> 13:11.000
 and he was the first person without pause,

13:11.000 --> 13:12.360
 this wasn't a political statement,

13:12.360 --> 13:13.400
 this was anything,

13:13.400 --> 13:16.560
 just walked toward me and gave me a big hug

13:16.560 --> 13:18.360
 and say, it's great to see you.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.360
 And I can't tell you how great it felt

13:20.360 --> 13:21.640
 because I, in that moment,

13:21.640 --> 13:24.240
 realized the absence of that connection back in Boston

13:24.240 --> 13:26.840
 over just a couple of months.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.180
 And it's, we'll talk about it more,

13:30.180 --> 13:34.200
 but it's tragic to think about that distancing,

13:34.200 --> 13:36.880
 that dissolution of common humanity at scale,

13:36.880 --> 13:39.400
 what kind of impact it has on society.

13:39.400 --> 13:43.200
 Just across the board, political division,

13:43.200 --> 13:45.380
 and just in the quiet of your own mind,

13:45.380 --> 13:47.560
 in the privacy of your own home, the depression,

13:47.560 --> 13:51.180
 the sadness, the loneliness that leads to suicide.

13:51.180 --> 13:55.800
 And forget suicide, just low key suffering.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.400
 Yeah, no, I think that's the suffering,

13:58.400 --> 14:00.940
 that isolation, we're not meant to live alone,

14:00.940 --> 14:02.400
 we're not meant to live apart from one another.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.440
 I mean, that's, of course, the ideology of lockdown

14:04.440 --> 14:07.920
 is to make people live apart, alone, isolated,

14:07.920 --> 14:10.240
 so that we don't spread diseases to each other, right?

14:10.240 --> 14:12.280
 But we're not actually designed as a species

14:12.280 --> 14:13.180
 to live that way.

14:14.100 --> 14:16.600
 And that, what you're describing, I think,

14:16.600 --> 14:19.260
 if everyone's honest with themselves, have felt,

14:19.260 --> 14:22.020
 especially in places where lockdowns have been

14:22.020 --> 14:23.940
 sort of very militantly enforced,

14:23.940 --> 14:26.420
 has felt deep into their core.

14:26.420 --> 14:29.200
 Well, if I could just return to the question of deaths.

14:30.060 --> 14:31.580
 You said that the data isn't perfect,

14:31.580 --> 14:35.460
 because we need these kind of seroprevalence surveys

14:35.460 --> 14:37.940
 to understand how many cases there were

14:37.940 --> 14:39.940
 to determine the rate of deaths.

14:39.940 --> 14:42.100
 And we need to have a strong footing

14:42.100 --> 14:42.940
 in the number of deaths.

14:42.940 --> 14:45.800
 But if we assume that the number of deaths

14:45.800 --> 14:49.260
 is approximately correct, like what's your sense,

14:49.260 --> 14:52.660
 what kind of statements can we say about the deadliness

14:52.660 --> 14:55.920
 of COVID across different demographics?

14:55.920 --> 14:58.820
 Maybe not in a political way or in the current way,

14:58.820 --> 15:03.380
 but when history looks back at this moment of time,

15:03.380 --> 15:05.220
 50 years from now, 100 years from now,

15:05.220 --> 15:09.540
 the way we look at the pandemic 100 years ago,

15:09.540 --> 15:12.500
 what will they say about the deadliness of COVID?

15:12.500 --> 15:14.980
 I mean, I think the deadliness of COVID depends on

15:14.980 --> 15:18.480
 not just the virus itself, but who it infects.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.380
 So probably the most important thing about it,

15:20.380 --> 15:21.780
 about the deadliness of COVID,

15:21.780 --> 15:26.260
 is this steep age gradient in the mortality rate.

15:26.260 --> 15:28.900
 So according to these seroprevalence studies

15:28.900 --> 15:31.680
 that have been done, now hundreds of them,

15:32.720 --> 15:34.380
 mostly from before vaccination,

15:34.380 --> 15:35.580
 because vaccination also reduces

15:35.580 --> 15:37.780
 the mortality risk of COVID,

15:37.780 --> 15:42.460
 the seroprevalence studies suggest that the risk of death,

15:42.460 --> 15:47.260
 if you're, say, over the age of 70, is very high.

15:47.260 --> 15:50.620
 You know, 5% if you get COVID.

15:50.620 --> 15:54.020
 If you're under the age of 70, it's lower, 0.05.

15:54.020 --> 15:56.380
 But there's not a single sharp cutoff.

15:56.380 --> 15:59.520
 It's more like, I have a rule of thumb that I use.

15:59.520 --> 16:03.400
 So if you're 50, say, the infection fatality rate

16:03.400 --> 16:07.500
 from COVID is 0.2%, according to the seroprevalence data.

16:07.500 --> 16:11.460
 That means 99.8% survival if you're 50.

16:11.460 --> 16:14.580
 And for every seven years of age above that, double it.

16:14.580 --> 16:17.020
 Every seven years of age below that, halve it.

16:17.020 --> 16:20.940
 So a 57 year old would have a 0.4%.

16:20.940 --> 16:24.680
 Mortality, a 64 year old would have a 0.8% and so on.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.860
 And if you have a severe chronic disease,

16:26.860 --> 16:29.500
 like diabetes or if you're morbidly obese,

16:29.500 --> 16:32.420
 it's like adding seven years to your life.

16:32.420 --> 16:35.060
 And this is for unvaccinated folks?

16:35.060 --> 16:38.940
 This is unvaccinated before Delta also.

16:38.940 --> 16:41.700
 Are there a lot of people that would be listening to this

16:41.700 --> 16:43.940
 with PhDs at the end of their name

16:43.940 --> 16:47.500
 that would disagree with the 99.8, would you say?

16:47.500 --> 16:49.940
 So I think there's some disagreement over this.

16:49.940 --> 16:52.980
 And the disagreement is about the quality

16:52.980 --> 16:56.260
 of the seroprevalence studies that were conducted.

16:56.260 --> 16:58.900
 So as I said earlier, I was the senior investigator

16:58.900 --> 17:00.620
 in three different seroprevalence studies

17:00.620 --> 17:02.020
 very early in the epidemic.

17:03.060 --> 17:05.220
 I view them as very high quality studies.

17:07.100 --> 17:10.700
 In Santa Clara County, what we did is we used a test kit

17:10.700 --> 17:15.700
 that we obtained from someone who works

17:16.260 --> 17:18.020
 in major league baseball, actually.

17:18.020 --> 17:21.300
 He had ordered these test kits very early in March, 2020,

17:21.300 --> 17:25.980
 that measures, very accurately measures antibody levels,

17:25.980 --> 17:28.620
 antibodies in the bloodstream.

17:28.620 --> 17:31.700
 These test kits were eventually were approved by the,

17:31.700 --> 17:35.980
 had an EUA by the emergency use authorization by the FDA,

17:35.980 --> 17:37.760
 sort of shortly after we did this.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.260
 And it had a very low false positive rate,

17:40.260 --> 17:43.500
 false positive means if you don't have

17:43.500 --> 17:46.100
 these COVID antibodies in your bloodstream,

17:46.100 --> 17:48.340
 the kit shows up positive anyways.

17:48.340 --> 17:51.420
 That turns out to happen about 0.5% of the time.

17:52.580 --> 17:56.060
 And based on studies, a very large number of studies

17:56.060 --> 18:00.540
 looking at blood from 2018, you try it against this kit,

18:00.540 --> 18:03.340
 and 0.5% of the time, 2018,

18:03.340 --> 18:05.620
 there shouldn't be antibodies there to COVID.

18:05.620 --> 18:08.780
 So if it turns positive to false positives, 0.5% of the time.

18:08.780 --> 18:13.780
 And then like a false negative rate, about 10%, 12%,

18:14.380 --> 18:16.740
 something like that, I don't remember the exact number,

18:16.740 --> 18:18.980
 but the false positive rate is the important thing there.

18:18.980 --> 18:22.420
 So you have a population in March, 2020 or April, 2020,

18:22.420 --> 18:25.300
 with very low fraction of patients

18:25.300 --> 18:26.580
 having been exposed to COVID,

18:26.580 --> 18:28.780
 you don't know how much, but low,

18:28.780 --> 18:30.380
 even a small false positive rate

18:30.380 --> 18:33.440
 could end up biasing your study quite a bit.

18:34.340 --> 18:36.020
 But there's a formula to adjust for that.

18:36.020 --> 18:37.540
 You can adjust for the false positive rate,

18:37.540 --> 18:38.380
 false negative rate.

18:38.380 --> 18:42.060
 We did that adjustment, and those studies found

18:42.060 --> 18:43.460
 in a community population,

18:43.460 --> 18:45.100
 so leaving aside people in nursing homes

18:45.100 --> 18:47.100
 who have a higher death rate from COVID,

18:48.660 --> 18:52.060
 the death rate was 0.2% in Santa Clara County

18:52.060 --> 18:53.460
 and in LA County.

18:53.460 --> 18:56.060
 Across all age groups in a community,

18:56.060 --> 18:58.100
 community meaning just like regular folks.

18:58.100 --> 19:00.180
 Yeah, so that's actually a real important question too.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.180
 So the Santa Clara study,

19:02.180 --> 19:04.400
 we did this Facebook sampling scheme,

19:05.780 --> 19:08.060
 which is, I mean, not the ideal thing,

19:08.060 --> 19:11.140
 but it was very difficult to get a random sample

19:11.140 --> 19:13.300
 and during lockdown,

19:14.180 --> 19:17.060
 where we put out an ad on Facebook

19:17.060 --> 19:19.860
 soliciting people to volunteer for the study,

19:19.860 --> 19:22.260
 randomly selected set of people.

19:22.260 --> 19:24.120
 We were hoping to get a random selection of people

19:24.120 --> 19:26.340
 from Santa Clara County, but it tended to,

19:26.340 --> 19:27.580
 the people who tend to volunteer

19:27.580 --> 19:28.940
 were from the richer parts of the county.

19:28.940 --> 19:31.300
 Like I had Stanford professors writing,

19:31.300 --> 19:32.260
 begging to be in the study

19:32.260 --> 19:34.180
 because they wanted to know their antibody levels.

19:34.180 --> 19:36.220
 So we did some adjustment for that.

19:36.220 --> 19:38.340
 In LA County, we hired a firm

19:38.340 --> 19:42.500
 that had a preexisting representative sample of LA County.

19:44.460 --> 19:46.020
 But it didn't include nursing homes,

19:46.020 --> 19:48.200
 it didn't include people in jail, things like that,

19:48.200 --> 19:49.760
 didn't include the homeless populations.

19:49.760 --> 19:53.860
 So it's representative of a community dwelling population,

19:53.860 --> 19:54.940
 both of those.

19:54.940 --> 19:57.940
 And there we found that both in LA County

19:57.940 --> 20:00.360
 and Santa Clara County in April, 2020,

20:00.360 --> 20:04.260
 something like 40 to 50 times more infections

20:04.260 --> 20:06.780
 than cases in both places.

20:06.780 --> 20:09.220
 So for every case that had been reported

20:09.220 --> 20:10.940
 to the public health authorities,

20:10.940 --> 20:15.340
 we found 40 or 50 other infections,

20:15.340 --> 20:17.940
 people with antibodies in their blood

20:17.940 --> 20:20.220
 that suggested that they'd had COVID and recovered.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.580
 So people were not reporting,

20:21.580 --> 20:25.020
 or severe, at least in those days, underreporting.

20:25.020 --> 20:26.900
 Yeah, I mean, there was testing problem.

20:26.900 --> 20:29.020
 I mean, there weren't so many tests available.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.180
 People didn't know.

20:30.180 --> 20:32.720
 A lot of them, we asked a set of questions

20:32.720 --> 20:34.860
 about the symptoms they'd faced,

20:34.860 --> 20:36.340
 and most of them said they'd faced no symptoms,

20:36.340 --> 20:38.300
 or at the most, 30, 40% of them said

20:38.300 --> 20:39.460
 they'd faced no symptoms.

20:40.780 --> 20:42.200
 And I mean, even these days,

20:42.200 --> 20:44.260
 how many people report that they get COVID

20:44.260 --> 20:45.100
 when they get COVID?

20:45.100 --> 20:49.140
 Okay, have those numbers, that 0.2%,

20:49.140 --> 20:51.420
 has that approximately held up over time?

20:51.420 --> 20:53.420
 That is, so Professor John Ioannidis,

20:53.420 --> 20:55.260
 who's a colleague of mine at Stanford,

20:55.260 --> 20:56.800
 is a world expert in meta now,

20:56.800 --> 21:00.140
 so probably the most cited scientist on Earth, I think,

21:00.140 --> 21:01.220
 at least living.

21:01.220 --> 21:04.780
 He did a meta analysis of now 100 or more

21:04.780 --> 21:06.460
 of these seroprevalence studies.

21:08.020 --> 21:11.540
 And what he found was that that 0.2%

21:11.540 --> 21:13.820
 is roughly the worldwide number.

21:13.820 --> 21:17.380
 In fact, I think he cites this lower number, 0.15%,

21:17.380 --> 21:20.620
 as the median infection fatality rate worldwide.

21:20.620 --> 21:21.900
 So we did these studies,

21:21.900 --> 21:25.220
 and it generated an enormous amount of blowback

21:25.220 --> 21:27.060
 by people who thought that the infection fatality rate

21:27.060 --> 21:28.460
 is much higher.

21:28.460 --> 21:30.420
 And there's some controversy over the quality

21:30.420 --> 21:32.380
 of some of the other studies that are done.

21:32.380 --> 21:34.700
 And so there are some people who look at this

21:34.700 --> 21:36.380
 same literature and say, well,

21:36.380 --> 21:39.780
 the lower quality studies tend to have lower IFRs.

21:39.780 --> 21:40.620
 The higher quality studies.

21:40.620 --> 21:41.460
 IFR?

21:41.460 --> 21:43.380
 Oh, infection fatality rate, I apologize.

21:43.380 --> 21:45.740
 I do this in lectures, too, I apologize.

21:45.740 --> 21:47.620
 And I'm going to rudely interrupt you

21:48.620 --> 21:51.660
 and ask for the basics sometimes, if it's okay.

21:51.660 --> 21:52.580
 No, of course.

21:52.580 --> 21:55.500
 So these higher quality studies, they say,

21:55.500 --> 21:56.620
 tend to produce higher IFR.

21:56.620 --> 21:58.820
 But the problem is that if you want

21:58.820 --> 22:00.860
 a global infection fatality rate,

22:00.860 --> 22:04.420
 you need to get seroprevalence studies from everywhere,

22:04.420 --> 22:05.940
 even in places that don't necessarily

22:05.940 --> 22:07.060
 have the infrastructure set up

22:07.060 --> 22:09.620
 to produce very, very high quality studies.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.980
 And in poor places in the world,

22:14.740 --> 22:15.900
 places like Africa,

22:15.900 --> 22:18.220
 the infection fatality rate is incredibly low.

22:20.020 --> 22:23.500
 And in some richer places, like New York City,

22:23.500 --> 22:25.780
 the infection fatality rate is much higher.

22:25.780 --> 22:30.780
 There's a range of IFRs, not a single number.

22:30.780 --> 22:32.620
 This sometimes surprises people,

22:32.620 --> 22:34.140
 because they think, well, it's a virus,

22:34.140 --> 22:36.780
 it should have the same properties no matter where it goes.

22:36.780 --> 22:41.780
 But the virus kills or infects or hurts

22:42.140 --> 22:44.740
 in interaction with the host.

22:44.740 --> 22:47.780
 And the properties of both the host and the virus

22:47.780 --> 22:50.140
 combine to produce the outcome.

22:50.140 --> 22:53.020
 But you also mentioned the environment, too?

22:53.020 --> 22:55.580
 Well, I'm thinking mainly just about the person.

22:55.580 --> 22:56.900
 Like if I'm gonna think about it,

22:56.900 --> 22:58.820
 the most simplest way to think about it is age.

22:58.820 --> 23:01.220
 Age is the single most important risk factor.

23:01.220 --> 23:05.980
 So older places are going to have a higher IFR

23:05.980 --> 23:07.020
 than younger places.

23:07.020 --> 23:10.140
 Africa, 3% of Africa is over 65.

23:10.140 --> 23:12.660
 So in some sense, it's not surprising

23:12.660 --> 23:15.380
 that they have a low infection fatality rate.

23:15.380 --> 23:16.900
 So that's one way you would explain

23:16.900 --> 23:18.980
 the difference between Africa and New York City

23:18.980 --> 23:22.020
 in terms of the fatality rate, is the age, the average age?

23:22.020 --> 23:24.820
 Yeah, and especially in the early days of the epidemic

23:24.820 --> 23:29.740
 in New York City, the older populations

23:29.740 --> 23:33.380
 living in nursing homes were differentially infected

23:33.380 --> 23:35.900
 based on, because of policies that were adopted,

23:35.900 --> 23:39.100
 to send COVID infected patients back to nursing homes

23:39.100 --> 23:40.340
 to keep hospitals empty.

23:40.340 --> 23:42.900
 What do you mean by differentially infected?

23:42.900 --> 23:47.380
 The policy that you adopt determines who is most exposed.

23:47.380 --> 23:48.500
 Right, okay.

23:48.500 --> 23:49.340
 So that's what I mean by different.

23:49.340 --> 23:52.820
 The policy, it's the person that matters.

23:52.820 --> 23:56.140
 I mean, it's not like the virus just kind of doesn't care.

23:56.140 --> 23:59.340
 I mean, the policy determines the nature of the interaction.

23:59.340 --> 24:01.660
 And there's also, I mean, there is some contribution

24:01.660 --> 24:04.900
 from the environment, different regions

24:04.900 --> 24:08.300
 have different proximity maybe of people interacting

24:08.300 --> 24:10.100
 or the dynamics of the way they interact.

24:10.100 --> 24:12.740
 Yeah, like if you have situations

24:12.740 --> 24:17.260
 where there's lots of intergenerational interactions,

24:17.260 --> 24:19.500
 then you have a very different risk profile

24:19.500 --> 24:21.500
 than if you have societies

24:21.500 --> 24:23.540
 that are where generations are more separate

24:23.540 --> 24:24.380
 from one another.

24:25.860 --> 24:27.620
 Okay, so let me just finish real fast about this.

24:27.620 --> 24:32.620
 So you have in New York, you have a population

24:32.820 --> 24:34.180
 that was infected in the early days

24:34.180 --> 24:36.980
 that was very likely going to die,

24:36.980 --> 24:40.140
 had a much higher likelihood of dying if infected.

24:40.140 --> 24:43.220
 And so New York City had a higher IFR,

24:43.220 --> 24:48.220
 especially in the early days than like Africa has had.

24:49.260 --> 24:50.900
 The other thing is treatment, right?

24:50.900 --> 24:52.940
 So the treatments that we adopted

24:52.940 --> 24:54.020
 in the early days of the epidemic,

24:54.020 --> 24:58.220
 I think actually may have exacerbated the risk of death.

24:58.220 --> 25:00.100
 Which treatments?

25:00.100 --> 25:03.180
 Using ventilators, like the over reliance on ventilators

25:03.180 --> 25:04.580
 is what I'm primarily thinking of,

25:04.580 --> 25:06.520
 but I can think of other things.

25:06.520 --> 25:09.620
 But that also we've learned over time

25:09.620 --> 25:12.700
 how better to manage patients with the disease.

25:12.700 --> 25:14.700
 So you have all those things combined.

25:14.700 --> 25:18.100
 So that's where the controversy over this number is.

25:18.100 --> 25:23.100
 I mean, New York City also is a central hub

25:23.660 --> 25:28.660
 for those who tweet and those who write powerful stories

25:29.220 --> 25:31.740
 and narratives in article form.

25:31.740 --> 25:34.700
 And I remember those quite dramatic stories

25:34.700 --> 25:36.500
 about sort of doctors in the hospitals

25:36.500 --> 25:37.380
 and these kinds of things.

25:37.380 --> 25:40.500
 I mean, there's very serious, very dramatic,

25:40.500 --> 25:44.840
 very tragic deaths going on always in hospitals.

25:44.840 --> 25:49.840
 Those stories, loved ones losing each other on a deathbed,

25:50.860 --> 25:52.340
 that's always tragic.

25:52.340 --> 25:55.220
 And you can always write a hell of a good story about that.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.220
 And you should, about the loss of loved ones.

25:58.220 --> 26:01.820
 But they were doing it pretty well, I would say,

26:01.820 --> 26:04.060
 over this kind of dramatic deaths.

26:04.060 --> 26:09.060
 And so in response to that, it's very unpleasant to hear,

26:09.240 --> 26:11.140
 even to consider the possibility

26:11.140 --> 26:16.140
 that the death rate is not as high as you might feel.

26:17.500 --> 26:20.580
 Yeah, I was surprised by the reaction,

26:20.580 --> 26:23.860
 both by regular people and also the scientific community

26:23.860 --> 26:25.660
 in response to those studies,

26:25.660 --> 26:28.240
 those early studies in April of 2020.

26:29.100 --> 26:31.620
 To me, they were studies.

26:31.620 --> 26:33.640
 I mean, they're the kinds of,

26:33.640 --> 26:35.620
 not exactly the kinds of work I've worked on all my life,

26:35.620 --> 26:39.700
 but kind of like the kind of, you write a paper

26:39.700 --> 26:42.860
 and you get responses from your fellow scientists

26:42.860 --> 26:45.340
 and you change the paper to improve it,

26:45.340 --> 26:47.260
 you hopefully learn something from it.

26:47.260 --> 26:50.480
 Well, but to push back, it's just a study.

26:50.480 --> 26:53.260
 But there's some studies, and this is kind of interesting,

26:53.260 --> 26:57.200
 because I've received similar pushback on other topics.

26:59.380 --> 27:04.380
 There's some studies that, if wrong,

27:04.380 --> 27:09.380
 might have wide ranging detrimental effects on society.

27:09.740 --> 27:12.000
 So that's the way they would perceive the studies.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.900
 If you say the death rate is lower,

27:13.900 --> 27:16.500
 and you end up, as you often do in science,

27:16.500 --> 27:19.940
 realizing that, nope, that was a flaw

27:19.940 --> 27:21.140
 in the way the study was conducted,

27:21.140 --> 27:23.900
 or we're just not representative of a broader population,

27:23.900 --> 27:26.020
 and then you realize the death rate is much higher,

27:26.020 --> 27:29.620
 that might be very damaging in people's view.

27:29.620 --> 27:33.500
 So that's probably where the scientific community

27:33.500 --> 27:36.660
 sort of just steel man the kind of response,

27:36.660 --> 27:39.080
 is that's where they felt like,

27:40.020 --> 27:43.420
 there's some findings where you better be damn sure

27:43.420 --> 27:45.880
 before you kind of report them.

27:45.880 --> 27:47.400
 Yeah, I mean, we were pretty sure we were right,

27:47.400 --> 27:48.500
 and it turns out we were right.

27:48.500 --> 27:53.500
 So we released the Santa Clara study

27:54.120 --> 27:56.780
 via this open science process

27:56.780 --> 27:59.860
 and this server called MedArchive.

27:59.860 --> 28:02.220
 It's designed for releasing studies

28:02.220 --> 28:03.900
 that have not yet been peer reviewed

28:03.900 --> 28:06.540
 in order to garner comment from the scientists

28:06.540 --> 28:07.600
 before peer review.

28:08.540 --> 28:09.880
 The LA County study,

28:09.880 --> 28:12.400
 we went through this traditional peer review process

28:12.400 --> 28:13.660
 and got it published in the Journal

28:13.660 --> 28:16.580
 of American Medical Association sometime in like July,

28:16.580 --> 28:19.040
 I think, I forget the date, of 2020.

28:19.040 --> 28:22.000
 The Santa Clara study released in April of 2020

28:22.000 --> 28:25.100
 in this sort of working paper archive.

28:25.100 --> 28:28.180
 The reason was that we felt we had an obligation,

28:28.180 --> 28:31.960
 we had a result that we thought was quite important,

28:31.960 --> 28:35.020
 and we wanted to tell the scientific community about it

28:35.020 --> 28:36.700
 and also tell the world about it.

28:36.700 --> 28:38.100
 And we wanted to get feedback.

28:38.100 --> 28:39.840
 I mean, that's part of the purpose

28:39.840 --> 28:42.280
 of sending it to these kinds of places.

28:42.280 --> 28:45.500
 I think a lot of the problem is that

28:45.500 --> 28:47.860
 when people think about published science,

28:47.860 --> 28:50.380
 they think of it as automatically true.

28:50.380 --> 28:51.460
 And if it goes through peer review,

28:51.460 --> 28:52.300
 it's automatically true.

28:52.300 --> 28:53.300
 If it hasn't gone through peer review,

28:53.300 --> 28:54.940
 it's not automatically true.

28:54.940 --> 28:56.540
 And especially in medicine,

28:56.540 --> 28:59.860
 when we're not used to having this access

28:59.860 --> 29:03.420
 to pre peer reviewed work.

29:03.420 --> 29:05.860
 I mean, in economics, actually, that's quite normal.

29:05.860 --> 29:07.940
 You takes years to get something published.

29:07.940 --> 29:10.660
 So there's a very active debate over

29:10.660 --> 29:13.460
 or discussion about papers before they're peer reviewed

29:13.460 --> 29:16.260
 in this sort of working paper way,

29:16.260 --> 29:20.460
 much less normal or much newer in medicine.

29:20.460 --> 29:21.520
 And so I think part of that,

29:21.520 --> 29:26.100
 the perception about what process happens in open science

29:26.100 --> 29:29.380
 when you release a study, that got people confused.

29:29.380 --> 29:31.500
 And you're right, it was a very important result

29:31.500 --> 29:33.780
 because we had just locked the world down

29:33.780 --> 29:38.740
 in middle of March with, I think, catastrophic results.

29:38.740 --> 29:41.940
 And if that study was right, if our study was right,

29:41.940 --> 29:44.020
 that meant we'd made a mistake.

29:44.020 --> 29:45.820
 And not because the death rate was low,

29:45.820 --> 29:47.800
 that's actually not the key thing there.

29:47.800 --> 29:51.620
 The key thing is that we had adopted these policies,

29:51.620 --> 29:53.340
 these test and trace policies,

29:53.340 --> 29:55.420
 these policies, these lockdown policies

29:55.420 --> 30:00.060
 aimed at suppressing the virus level to close to zero.

30:00.060 --> 30:01.900
 That was essentially the idea.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.820
 If we can just get the virus to go away,

30:04.820 --> 30:07.420
 we won't have to ever worry about it again.

30:07.420 --> 30:09.360
 The main problem with our result

30:09.360 --> 30:11.580
 as far as that strategy was concerned wasn't the death rate,

30:11.580 --> 30:14.820
 it was the 40 to 50 times more infections than cases.

30:14.820 --> 30:19.580
 It was the 2.5% or 3% or 4% prevalence rate

30:19.580 --> 30:23.060
 that we identified of the antibodies in the population.

30:23.060 --> 30:25.820
 If that number is right, it's too late.

30:25.820 --> 30:28.140
 The virus is not going to go to zero.

30:28.140 --> 30:30.260
 And no matter how much we test and trace and isolate,

30:30.260 --> 30:32.860
 we're not going to get the viral level down to zero.

30:34.020 --> 30:36.460
 So we're gonna have to let the virus

30:36.460 --> 30:39.820
 go through the entire population in some way or some other?

30:39.820 --> 30:41.160
 We can talk about that in a bit.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.460
 That's the Great Barrington Declaration.

30:42.460 --> 30:44.240
 You don't have to let the virus go through the population.

30:44.240 --> 30:45.860
 You can shield preferentially.

30:46.900 --> 30:50.060
 The policy we chose was to shield preferentially

30:50.060 --> 30:52.180
 the laptop class,

30:52.180 --> 30:54.660
 the set of people who could work from home

30:54.660 --> 30:56.700
 without losing their job.

30:56.700 --> 30:59.420
 And we did a very good job at protecting them.

30:59.420 --> 31:04.080
 Well, let me take a small tangent.

31:04.080 --> 31:06.620
 We're gonna jump around in time,

31:06.620 --> 31:09.260
 which I think will be the best way to tell the story.

31:09.260 --> 31:10.580
 So that was the beginning.

31:10.580 --> 31:13.940
 Yeah, okay, actually, can I go back one more thing for that?

31:13.940 --> 31:14.780
 Because that's really important

31:14.780 --> 31:16.620
 and I should have started with this.

31:17.540 --> 31:22.000
 What led me to do those studies was a paper

31:22.000 --> 31:23.740
 that I had remembered seeing

31:23.740 --> 31:26.420
 from the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009.

31:26.420 --> 31:28.340
 This is where I've been much less active

31:28.340 --> 31:29.180
 in writing about that.

31:29.180 --> 31:32.880
 I had written like a paper or two about that in 2009.

31:34.020 --> 31:38.780
 There was actually the same debate over the mortality rate,

31:38.780 --> 31:41.660
 except it unfolded over the course of three years,

31:41.660 --> 31:43.240
 two or three years.

31:43.240 --> 31:47.980
 The early studies of the mortality rate in H1N1

31:47.980 --> 31:52.220
 counted the number of cases in the denominator,

31:52.220 --> 31:53.680
 counted the number of deaths in the numerator,

31:53.680 --> 31:56.620
 cases meaning people identified as having H1N1,

31:56.620 --> 31:59.460
 showing up the doctor, tested to have it.

32:00.500 --> 32:04.040
 And the earliest estimates of the H1N1 mortality

32:04.040 --> 32:08.000
 were like 4%, 3%, really, really high.

32:08.980 --> 32:11.300
 Over the course of a couple of more years,

32:11.300 --> 32:12.940
 a whole bunch of seroprevalence studies,

32:12.940 --> 32:15.820
 seroprevalence studies of H1N1 flu came out.

32:15.820 --> 32:20.620
 And it turned out that there were 100 or more times

32:20.620 --> 32:22.220
 people infected per case.

32:23.260 --> 32:27.540
 And so the mortality rate was actually something like 0.02%

32:27.540 --> 32:32.060
 for H1N1, not the three, like 100 fold difference.

32:32.060 --> 32:34.260
 So this made you think, okay,

32:34.260 --> 32:36.180
 it took us a couple of two or three years

32:36.180 --> 32:39.400
 to discover the truth behind the actual infections

32:40.420 --> 32:43.940
 for H1N1, and then what's the truth here

32:43.940 --> 32:45.060
 and can we get there faster?

32:45.060 --> 32:49.180
 Yeah, and it spreads in a similar way as the H1N1 flu did.

32:49.180 --> 32:51.640
 I mean, it spreads via solization,

32:51.640 --> 32:55.480
 via person to person breathing, kind of contact up.

32:55.480 --> 32:59.220
 It may be some by fomites, but it seems less likely now.

32:59.220 --> 33:01.740
 In any case, it seemed really important to me

33:01.740 --> 33:03.540
 to speed up the process

33:03.540 --> 33:05.900
 of having those seroprevalence studies

33:05.900 --> 33:09.060
 so that we can better understand who was at risk

33:09.060 --> 33:12.260
 and what the right strategy ought to be.

33:12.260 --> 33:17.260
 This might be a good place to kind of compare influenza,

33:17.320 --> 33:20.980
 the flu, and COVID in the context of the discussion

33:20.980 --> 33:24.420
 we just had, which is how deadly is COVID?

33:24.420 --> 33:26.620
 So you mentioned COVID is a very particular

33:26.620 --> 33:31.620
 kind of steepness, where the X axis is age.

33:32.180 --> 33:36.260
 So in that context, could you maybe compare influenza

33:36.260 --> 33:41.260
 and COVID, because a lot of people outside the folks

33:41.260 --> 33:45.140
 who suggest that the lizards who run the world

33:45.140 --> 33:48.460
 have completely fabricated and invented COVID,

33:48.460 --> 33:51.900
 outside of those folks, kind of the natural process

33:51.900 --> 33:54.660
 by which you dismiss the threat of COVID is, say,

33:54.660 --> 33:55.900
 well, it's just like the flu.

33:55.900 --> 33:58.780
 The flu is a very serious thing, actually.

33:58.780 --> 34:03.660
 So in that comparison, where does COVID stand?

34:03.660 --> 34:04.980
 Yeah, the flu is a very serious thing.

34:04.980 --> 34:07.980
 It kills 50, 60,000 people a year,

34:07.980 --> 34:08.820
 something I found out,

34:08.820 --> 34:11.340
 depending on the particular strain that goes around,

34:11.340 --> 34:12.760
 that's in the United States.

34:12.760 --> 34:15.060
 The primary difference to me,

34:15.060 --> 34:15.900
 there's lots of differences,

34:15.900 --> 34:17.340
 but one of the most salient differences

34:17.340 --> 34:20.120
 is the age gradient and mortality risk for the flu.

34:21.420 --> 34:25.820
 So the flu is more deadly to children than COVID is.

34:26.660 --> 34:28.460
 There's no controversy about that.

34:29.340 --> 34:34.340
 Children, thank God, have much less severe reactions

34:34.340 --> 34:39.340
 to COVID infection than they do to flu infections.

34:39.980 --> 34:41.900
 And rate of fatalities and stuff like that.

34:41.900 --> 34:42.860
 Rate of fatality, all of that.

34:42.860 --> 34:44.840
 I think you mentioned,

34:44.840 --> 34:47.060
 I mean, it's interesting to maybe also comment on,

34:47.060 --> 34:48.800
 I think in another conversation you mentioned

34:48.800 --> 34:53.800
 there's a U shape to the flu curve,

34:54.500 --> 34:57.540
 so meaning there's actually quite a large number of kids

34:57.540 --> 34:59.220
 that die from flu.

34:59.220 --> 35:03.000
 Yeah, I mean, the 1918 flu, the H1N1 flu,

35:03.000 --> 35:08.000
 the Spanish flu in the US killed millions of younger people.

35:09.500 --> 35:12.380
 And that is not the case with COVID.

35:13.460 --> 35:16.820
 More than, I'm gonna get the number wrong,

35:16.820 --> 35:19.280
 but something like 70, 80% of the deaths

35:19.280 --> 35:21.420
 are people over the age of 60.

35:21.420 --> 35:24.940
 Well, we've talked about the fear the whole time, really.

35:24.940 --> 35:27.960
 But my interaction with folks,

35:27.960 --> 35:30.260
 now I wanna have a family, I wanna have kids,

35:30.260 --> 35:32.820
 but I don't have that real firsthand experience,

35:32.820 --> 35:35.860
 but my interaction with folks is at the core of fear

35:35.860 --> 35:39.900
 that folks had is for their children.

35:39.900 --> 35:44.900
 Like that somehow I don't wanna get infected

35:46.060 --> 35:47.900
 because of the kids.

35:47.900 --> 35:50.780
 Because God forbid something happens to the kids.

35:50.780 --> 35:54.520
 And I think that obviously that makes a lot of sense

35:54.520 --> 35:57.480
 this kind of the kids come first no matter what,

35:57.480 --> 35:58.660
 that's number one priority.

35:58.660 --> 36:02.000
 But for this particular virus,

36:02.000 --> 36:05.860
 that reasoning was not grounded in data, it seems like,

36:05.860 --> 36:09.460
 or that emotion and feeling was not grounded in data.

36:09.460 --> 36:12.260
 But at the same time, this is way more deadly than the flu

36:12.260 --> 36:15.540
 just overall, and especially to older people.

36:15.540 --> 36:16.500
 Yes.

36:16.500 --> 36:17.340
 Right, so.

36:17.340 --> 36:21.220
 The numbers, when the story is all said and done,

36:21.220 --> 36:24.060
 COVID would take many more lives.

36:24.060 --> 36:27.380
 Yeah, so, I mean, 0.2 sounds like a small number,

36:27.380 --> 36:29.620
 but it's not a small number worldwide.

36:29.620 --> 36:31.520
 What do you think that number will be

36:31.520 --> 36:34.160
 by the, you know, that's not like me,

36:34.160 --> 36:37.220
 but would we cross, I think it's in the United States,

36:37.220 --> 36:40.700
 it's the way the deaths are currently reported,

36:40.700 --> 36:42.700
 it's like 800,000, something like that.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.420
 Do you think we'll cross a million?

36:44.420 --> 36:46.660
 Seems likely, yeah.

36:46.660 --> 36:49.060
 Do you think it's something that might continue

36:49.060 --> 36:50.820
 with different variants, what?

36:50.820 --> 36:53.460
 Well, I think, so we can talk about the end state of COVID.

36:53.460 --> 36:56.020
 The end state of COVID is it's here forever.

36:56.020 --> 37:01.020
 I think that there is good evidence of immunity

37:01.020 --> 37:05.660
 after infection, such that you're protected

37:05.660 --> 37:08.540
 both against reinfection and also against

37:08.540 --> 37:11.340
 severe disease upon reinfection.

37:11.340 --> 37:13.940
 So the second time you get it, it's not true for everyone,

37:13.940 --> 37:15.660
 but for many people, the second time you get it

37:15.660 --> 37:18.620
 will be milder, much milder than the first time you get it.

37:18.620 --> 37:22.720
 With the long tail, like that lasts for a long time.

37:22.720 --> 37:26.100
 Yeah, so just, there are studies that follow, of course,

37:26.100 --> 37:28.340
 people who are infected for a year,

37:28.340 --> 37:30.420
 and the reinfection rate is something like

37:30.420 --> 37:33.820
 somewhere between 0.3 and 1%.

37:33.820 --> 37:36.260
 And like a pretty fantastic study out in Italy

37:36.260 --> 37:38.780
 has found that, there's one in Sweden, I think,

37:38.780 --> 37:41.820
 there's a few studies that have found similar things.

37:41.820 --> 37:46.820
 And the reinfections tend to produce much milder disease,

37:46.940 --> 37:48.420
 much less likely to end up in the hospital,

37:48.420 --> 37:50.100
 much less likely to die.

37:50.100 --> 37:52.540
 So what the end state of COVID is,

37:52.540 --> 37:54.580
 it's circulating the population forever

37:54.580 --> 37:56.500
 and you get it multiple times.

37:56.500 --> 38:00.980
 Yeah, and then there's, I think, studies and discussions

38:00.980 --> 38:04.300
 like the best protection would be to get it

38:04.300 --> 38:06.220
 and then also to get vaccinated.

38:06.220 --> 38:08.740
 And then a lot of people push back against that

38:08.740 --> 38:10.700
 for the obvious reasons from both sides,

38:10.700 --> 38:13.060
 because somehow the discourse has become

38:13.060 --> 38:14.820
 less scientific and more political.

38:14.820 --> 38:18.100
 Well, I think you wanna, the first time you meet it

38:18.100 --> 38:20.300
 is gonna be the most deadly for you.

38:20.300 --> 38:21.540
 And so the first time you meet it,

38:21.540 --> 38:22.780
 it's just wise to be vaccinated.

38:22.780 --> 38:25.420
 The vaccine reduces severe disease.

38:25.420 --> 38:27.700
 Yeah, we'll talk about the vaccine,

38:27.700 --> 38:30.100
 because I wanna make sure I address it carefully

38:30.100 --> 38:32.720
 and properly and in full context.

38:35.020 --> 38:38.060
 But yes, sort of to add to the context,

38:38.060 --> 38:40.380
 a lot of the fascinating discussions we're having

38:40.380 --> 38:43.060
 is in the early days of COVID

38:43.060 --> 38:46.460
 and now for people who are unvaccinated.

38:46.460 --> 38:49.060
 That's where the interesting story is.

38:49.060 --> 38:52.740
 The policy story, the sociological story and so on.

38:52.740 --> 38:55.940
 But let me go to something really fascinating

38:55.940 --> 38:57.940
 just because of the people involved,

38:57.940 --> 38:59.260
 the human beings involved,

38:59.260 --> 39:03.020
 and because of how deeply I care about science

39:03.020 --> 39:07.740
 and also kindness, respect and love and human things.

39:07.740 --> 39:12.380
 Francis Collins wrote a letter in October 2020

39:12.380 --> 39:14.960
 to Anthony Fauci and I think somebody else.

39:15.940 --> 39:20.940
 I have the letter, oh, it's not a letter, email, I apologize.

39:20.940 --> 39:25.940
 Hi, Tony and Cliff, cgbdeclaration.org.

39:29.500 --> 39:32.940
 This proposal, this is the Great Barrington Declaration

39:32.940 --> 39:34.940
 that you're a coauthor on.

39:34.940 --> 39:38.620
 This proposal from the three fringe epidemiologists

39:38.620 --> 39:40.120
 who met with the secretary

39:40.120 --> 39:42.180
 seem to be getting a lot of attention

39:42.180 --> 39:45.940
 and even a co signature from Nobel Prize winner,

39:45.940 --> 39:48.700
 Mike Levitt at Stanford.

39:48.700 --> 39:51.180
 There needs to be a quick and devastating

39:51.180 --> 39:54.820
 published take down of its premises.

39:54.820 --> 39:57.980
 I don't see anything like that online yet.

39:57.980 --> 40:00.460
 Is it underway, question mark, Francis.

40:00.460 --> 40:03.340
 Francis Collins, director of the NIH,

40:03.340 --> 40:06.140
 somebody I talked to on this podcast recently.

40:06.140 --> 40:09.660
 Okay, a million questions I wanna ask.

40:09.660 --> 40:12.620
 But first, how did that make you feel

40:12.620 --> 40:17.620
 when you first saw this email come to light,

40:17.620 --> 40:20.940
 when did it come to light?

40:20.940 --> 40:22.860
 This week, actually, I think, or last week.

40:22.860 --> 40:25.620
 Okay, so this is because of freedom of information.

40:25.620 --> 40:26.460
 Yeah.

40:26.460 --> 40:30.180
 Which, by the way, sort of maybe,

40:30.180 --> 40:32.140
 because I do wanna add positive stuff

40:32.140 --> 40:34.100
 on the side of Francis here.

40:36.220 --> 40:37.860
 Boy, when I see stuff like that,

40:37.860 --> 40:42.860
 I wonder if all my emails leaked, how much embarrassing stuff.

40:43.020 --> 40:45.140
 Like, I think I'm a good person,

40:45.140 --> 40:49.300
 but I haven't read my old emails.

40:49.300 --> 40:53.260
 Maybe, I'm pretty sure sometimes I could be an asshole.

40:53.260 --> 40:54.980
 Well, I mean, look, he's a Christian,

40:54.980 --> 40:57.060
 and I'm a Christian, I'm supposed to forgive, right?

40:57.060 --> 41:00.060
 I mean, I think he was looking at this

41:01.500 --> 41:03.780
 Great Barrington Declaration as a political problem

41:03.780 --> 41:07.340
 to be solved, as opposed to a serious

41:07.340 --> 41:09.980
 alternative approach to the epidemic.

41:09.980 --> 41:12.280
 So maybe we'll talk about it in more detail,

41:12.280 --> 41:15.020
 but just in case people are not familiar,

41:15.020 --> 41:18.900
 Great Barrington Declaration was a document

41:18.900 --> 41:22.300
 that you coauthored that basically argues

41:22.300 --> 41:26.220
 against this idea of lockdown as a solution to COVID,

41:26.220 --> 41:29.420
 and you propose another solution that we'll talk about.

41:29.420 --> 41:34.420
 But the point is, it's not that dramatic of a document,

41:34.860 --> 41:36.920
 it is just a document that criticizes

41:36.920 --> 41:38.940
 one policy solution that was proposed.

41:38.940 --> 41:41.180
 But it was the policy solution that had been put forward

41:41.180 --> 41:44.900
 by Dr. Collins and by Tony Fauci,

41:44.900 --> 41:48.060
 and a few other science, I mean, I think a relatively

41:48.060 --> 41:50.760
 small number of scientists and epidemiologists

41:50.760 --> 41:55.760
 in charge of the advice given to governments worldwide.

41:56.700 --> 42:00.060
 And it was a challenge to that policy

42:00.060 --> 42:02.940
 that said that, look, there is an alternate path,

42:02.940 --> 42:06.080
 that the path we've chosen, this path of lockdown

42:06.080 --> 42:09.020
 with the aim to suppress the virus to zero effectively,

42:09.020 --> 42:11.060
 I mean, that was unstated.

42:11.060 --> 42:14.620
 Cannot work and is causing catastrophic harm

42:14.620 --> 42:17.840
 to large numbers of poor and vulnerable people worldwide.

42:19.300 --> 42:23.500
 We put this out in October 4th, I think, of 2020,

42:23.500 --> 42:25.700
 and it went viral.

42:25.700 --> 42:27.140
 I mean, I've never actually been involved

42:27.140 --> 42:28.940
 with anything like this,

42:28.940 --> 42:31.580
 where I just put the document on the web,

42:31.580 --> 42:34.260
 and tens of thousands of doctors signed on,

42:34.260 --> 42:37.200
 hundreds of thousands of regular people signed on.

42:37.200 --> 42:40.220
 It really struck a chord of people,

42:40.220 --> 42:41.940
 because I think even by October of 2020,

42:41.940 --> 42:45.160
 people had this sense that there was something really wrong

42:45.160 --> 42:48.180
 with the COVID policy that we've been following.

42:48.180 --> 42:52.140
 And they were looking for reasonable people

42:52.140 --> 42:52.980
 to give an alternative.

42:52.980 --> 42:56.100
 I mean, we're not arguing that COVID isn't a serious thing.

42:56.100 --> 42:57.620
 I mean, it is a very serious thing.

42:57.620 --> 43:01.160
 This is why we had a policy that aimed at addressing it.

43:03.260 --> 43:05.740
 But we were saying that the policy we're following

43:05.740 --> 43:06.960
 is not the right one.

43:06.960 --> 43:11.960
 So how does a democratic government deal with that challenge?

43:12.960 --> 43:14.880
 So to me, that, you asked me how I felt.

43:14.880 --> 43:16.720
 I was actually, frankly, just,

43:16.720 --> 43:19.760
 I suspected there'd been some email exchanges like that,

43:19.760 --> 43:21.920
 not necessarily from Francis Collins,

43:21.920 --> 43:24.960
 around the government around this time.

43:24.960 --> 43:27.960
 I mean, I felt the full brunt of a propaganda campaign

43:29.280 --> 43:31.280
 almost immediately after we published it,

43:31.280 --> 43:34.080
 where newspapers mischaracterized it

43:34.080 --> 43:37.960
 in the same way over and over and over again,

43:39.280 --> 43:41.560
 and sought to characterize me

43:41.560 --> 43:45.920
 as sort of a marginal fringe figure or whatnot.

43:45.920 --> 43:47.640
 Sunetra Gupta, Martin Kulldorff,

43:47.640 --> 43:50.360
 or the tens of thousands of other people that signed it.

43:50.360 --> 43:53.560
 I felt the brunt of that all year long.

43:53.560 --> 43:56.240
 So to see this in black and white,

43:56.240 --> 43:58.680
 in the handwriting, essentially,

43:58.680 --> 44:01.040
 I mean, the metaphorical handwriting of Francis Collins

44:01.040 --> 44:02.320
 was actually, frankly, a disappointment,

44:02.320 --> 44:05.320
 because I've looked up to him for years.

44:05.320 --> 44:07.640
 Yeah, I've looked up to him as well.

44:07.640 --> 44:12.160
 I mean, I look for the best in people,

44:12.160 --> 44:15.320
 and I still look up to him.

44:15.320 --> 44:17.280
 What troubles me is several things.

44:19.560 --> 44:23.200
 The reason I said about the asshole emails

44:23.200 --> 44:28.200
 I send late at night is I can understand this email.

44:28.200 --> 44:33.200
 It's fear, it's panic, not being sure.

44:34.120 --> 44:37.440
 The fringe, three fringe epidemiologists.

44:37.440 --> 44:40.520
 Plus Mike Leavitt, who won a Nobel Prize, I mean.

44:40.520 --> 44:45.440
 But using fringe, maybe in my private thoughts,

44:45.440 --> 44:47.920
 I have said things like that about others,

44:47.920 --> 44:50.360
 like a little bit too unkind.

44:50.360 --> 44:52.320
 Like, you don't really mean it.

44:52.320 --> 44:56.120
 Now, add to that, he recently, this week,

44:56.120 --> 45:00.280
 whatever, doubled down on the fringe.

45:00.280 --> 45:02.520
 This is really troubling to me,

45:02.520 --> 45:04.960
 that I can excuse this email,

45:04.960 --> 45:09.960
 but the arrogance there, Francis, honestly,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.720
 I mean, broke my heart a little bit there.

45:12.720 --> 45:16.120
 This was an opportunity to, especially at this stage,

45:16.120 --> 45:18.880
 to say, just like I told him,

45:20.400 --> 45:23.720
 to say I was wrong to use those words in that email.

45:23.720 --> 45:27.360
 I was wrong to not be open to ideas.

45:27.360 --> 45:29.640
 I still believe that this is not,

45:29.640 --> 45:33.720
 like, say, like, actually argue with the proposal,

45:33.720 --> 45:36.240
 with the policy, the proposed solution.

45:36.240 --> 45:41.160
 Also, the devastating published,

45:41.160 --> 45:45.840
 devastating takedown, devastating takedown.

45:45.840 --> 45:50.840
 As you say, somebody who's sitting on billions of dollars

45:50.840 --> 45:54.640
 that they're giving to scientists,

45:54.640 --> 45:58.080
 some of whom are often not their best human beings

45:58.080 --> 46:00.640
 because they're fighting with each other over money,

46:00.640 --> 46:02.440
 not being cognizant of the fact

46:02.440 --> 46:06.600
 that you're challenging the integrity,

46:06.600 --> 46:08.800
 you're corrupting the integrity of scientists

46:08.800 --> 46:10.800
 by allocating them money,

46:10.800 --> 46:13.440
 you're now playing with that

46:13.440 --> 46:15.960
 by saying devastating takedown.

46:15.960 --> 46:19.600
 Where do you think the published takedown will come from?

46:19.600 --> 46:21.560
 It will come from those scientists

46:21.560 --> 46:23.320
 to whom you're giving money.

46:23.320 --> 46:25.400
 What kind of example would they give

46:25.400 --> 46:28.760
 to the academic community that thrives on freedom?

46:28.760 --> 46:33.760
 Like, this is, I believe Francis Collins is a great man.

46:34.560 --> 46:36.680
 One of the things I was troubled by

46:36.680 --> 46:38.920
 is the negative response to him

46:38.920 --> 46:40.800
 from people that don't understand

46:40.800 --> 46:44.040
 the positive impact that NIH has had on society,

46:44.040 --> 46:45.880
 how many people it's helped.

46:45.880 --> 46:50.000
 But this is exactly the, so he's not just a scientist.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.440
 He's not just a bureaucrat who distributes money.

46:53.440 --> 46:55.720
 He's also a scientific leader

46:55.720 --> 46:58.800
 that in difficult times we live in,

46:58.800 --> 47:01.360
 is supposed to inspire us with trust,

47:01.360 --> 47:04.880
 with love, with the freedom of thought.

47:04.880 --> 47:08.680
 He's supposed to, you know those fringe epidemiologists?

47:08.680 --> 47:10.880
 Those are the heroes of science.

47:10.880 --> 47:13.400
 When you look at the long arc of history,

47:13.400 --> 47:15.560
 we love those people.

47:15.560 --> 47:18.400
 We love ideas, even when they get proven wrong.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.240
 That's what always attracted me to science.

47:20.240 --> 47:23.720
 Like somebody, the lone voice saying,

47:23.720 --> 47:26.960
 oh no, the moon of Jupiter does move.

47:29.320 --> 47:30.720
 But the funny thing is,

47:30.720 --> 47:32.760
 Galileo was saying something truly revolutionary.

47:32.760 --> 47:34.920
 We were saying that what we proposed

47:34.920 --> 47:35.840
 in the Great Barbarian Declaration

47:35.840 --> 47:38.880
 was actually just the old pandemic plan.

47:38.880 --> 47:42.120
 It wasn't anything really fundamentally novel.

47:42.120 --> 47:46.320
 In fact, there were plans like this

47:46.320 --> 47:49.680
 that lockdown scientists had written

47:49.680 --> 47:52.680
 in late February, early March of 2020.

47:52.680 --> 47:54.400
 So we were not saying anything radical.

47:54.400 --> 47:57.120
 We were just calling for a debate effectively

47:57.120 --> 47:59.760
 over the existing lockdown policy.

48:00.880 --> 48:02.600
 And this is a disappointment,

48:02.600 --> 48:04.720
 a really, truly a big disappointment

48:04.720 --> 48:08.400
 because by doing this, you were absolutely right, Lex.

48:08.400 --> 48:12.280
 He sent a signal to so many other scientists

48:12.280 --> 48:15.160
 to just stay silent, even if you had reservations.

48:15.160 --> 48:18.360
 Yeah, devastating take down that people,

48:18.360 --> 48:21.280
 you know how many people wrote to me privately,

48:21.280 --> 48:23.760
 like Stanford, MIT,

48:23.760 --> 48:28.080
 how amazing the conversation with Francis Collins was?

48:28.080 --> 48:31.840
 There's a kind of admiration because,

48:31.840 --> 48:33.440
 okay, how do I put it?

48:33.440 --> 48:38.440
 A lot of people get into science

48:38.440 --> 48:40.480
 because they wanna help the world.

48:40.480 --> 48:42.320
 They get excited by the ideas

48:42.320 --> 48:46.240
 and they really are working hard to help

48:46.240 --> 48:47.840
 in whatever the discipline is.

48:47.840 --> 48:50.720
 And then there is sources of funding

48:50.720 --> 48:53.360
 which help you do help at a larger scale.

48:53.360 --> 48:58.280
 So you admire the people that are distributing the money

48:58.280 --> 49:01.320
 because they're often, at least on the surface,

49:01.320 --> 49:02.800
 are really also good people.

49:02.800 --> 49:04.760
 Oftentimes they're great scientists.

49:04.760 --> 49:06.800
 So like, it's amazing.

49:06.800 --> 49:08.480
 That's why I'm sort of,

49:10.640 --> 49:12.200
 like sometimes people from outside

49:12.200 --> 49:14.520
 think academia is broken some kind of way.

49:14.520 --> 49:16.320
 No, it's a beautiful thing.

49:16.320 --> 49:17.960
 It really is a beautiful thing.

49:17.960 --> 49:19.840
 And that's why it's so deeply heartbreaking

49:19.840 --> 49:23.760
 where this person is,

49:23.760 --> 49:26.440
 I don't think this is malevolence.

49:26.440 --> 49:31.160
 I think he's just incompetence of communication twice.

49:31.160 --> 49:34.080
 I think there's also arrogance at the bottom of it too.

49:34.080 --> 49:36.400
 But all of us have arrogance at the bottom.

49:36.400 --> 49:38.000
 There's a particular kind of arrogance.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.800
 So here it's of the same kind of arrogance

49:40.800 --> 49:43.280
 that you see when Tony Fauci gets on TV

49:43.280 --> 49:46.560
 and says that if you criticize me,

49:46.560 --> 49:48.440
 you're not simply criticizing a man,

49:48.440 --> 49:51.080
 you're criticizing science itself.

49:51.080 --> 49:55.000
 That is at the heart also of this email.

49:55.000 --> 49:59.480
 The certainty that the policies that they were recommending,

49:59.480 --> 50:01.080
 Collins and Fauci were recommending

50:01.080 --> 50:03.480
 to the president of the United States were right.

50:03.480 --> 50:06.480
 Not just right, but right so far right

50:06.480 --> 50:09.480
 that any challenge whatsoever to it is dangerous.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.680
 And I think that is really the heart of that email.

50:13.680 --> 50:18.680
 It's this idea that my position is unchallengeable.

50:19.840 --> 50:22.800
 Now to be completely, to be as charitable as I can be

50:22.800 --> 50:25.720
 to this, I believe they thought that.

50:25.720 --> 50:27.760
 I believe some of them still think that,

50:27.760 --> 50:31.840
 that there was only one true policy possible

50:31.840 --> 50:32.680
 in response to COVID.

50:32.680 --> 50:35.120
 Every other policy was immoral.

50:36.240 --> 50:37.840
 And if you come from that position,

50:37.840 --> 50:39.160
 then you write an email like that.

50:39.160 --> 50:42.600
 You go on TV, you say effectively la science est moi, right?

50:42.600 --> 50:44.560
 I mean, that is what happens

50:44.560 --> 50:47.720
 when you have this sort of unchallengeable arrogance

50:47.720 --> 50:50.040
 that the policy you're following is correct.

50:50.040 --> 50:52.240
 I mean, when we wrote the Great Bank Declaration,

50:52.240 --> 50:55.720
 what I was hoping for was a discussion

50:55.720 --> 50:57.760
 about how to protect the vulnerable.

50:57.760 --> 51:00.000
 I mean, that was the key idea to me in the whole thing

51:00.000 --> 51:02.960
 was better protection of the older population

51:02.960 --> 51:04.920
 who were really at really serious risk

51:04.920 --> 51:06.280
 if infected with COVID.

51:06.280 --> 51:08.640
 And we had been doing a very poor job, I thought,

51:08.640 --> 51:11.240
 to date in many places in protecting the vulnerable.

51:12.320 --> 51:16.600
 And what I wanted was a discussion by local public health

51:16.600 --> 51:18.800
 about better methods, better policies

51:18.800 --> 51:20.080
 to protect the vulnerable.

51:20.080 --> 51:25.080
 So when we were met with instead a series

51:25.080 --> 51:27.320
 of essentially propagandist lies about it.

51:27.320 --> 51:31.680
 So for instance, I kept hearing from reporters in those days,

51:31.680 --> 51:33.480
 why do you want to let the virus rip?

51:33.480 --> 51:34.560
 Let it rip, let it rip.

51:34.560 --> 51:37.960
 The words let it rip does not appear

51:37.960 --> 51:40.360
 in the Great Bank Declaration.

51:40.360 --> 51:42.760
 The goal isn't to let the virus rip.

51:42.760 --> 51:45.000
 The goal is to protect the vulnerable,

51:45.000 --> 51:49.520
 to let society go open schools and do other things

51:49.520 --> 51:51.120
 that function as best it can

51:51.120 --> 51:54.000
 in the midst of a terrible pandemic, yes,

51:54.000 --> 51:56.200
 but not let the virus rip

51:56.200 --> 51:58.680
 where the most vulnerable aren't protected.

51:58.680 --> 52:00.360
 The goal was to protect the vulnerable.

52:00.360 --> 52:01.600
 So why let it rip?

52:01.600 --> 52:03.680
 Because it was a propaganda term

52:03.680 --> 52:06.680
 to hit the fear centers of people's brains.

52:06.680 --> 52:08.200
 Oh, these people are immoral.

52:08.200 --> 52:09.800
 They just want to let the virus go through society

52:09.800 --> 52:11.080
 and hurt everybody.

52:11.080 --> 52:12.920
 That was the idea.

52:12.920 --> 52:15.400
 It was a way to preclude a discussion

52:15.400 --> 52:19.640
 and preclude a debate about the existing policy.

52:19.640 --> 52:23.360
 So this is an app called Clubhouse.

52:23.360 --> 52:28.360
 I've gone back on it recently to practice Russian,

52:28.600 --> 52:32.560
 unrelated for a few big Russian conversations coming up.

52:32.560 --> 52:33.600
 Anyway, it's a great way

52:33.600 --> 52:35.520
 to talk to regular people in Russian.

52:35.520 --> 52:37.920
 But I also, I was nervous.

52:37.920 --> 52:40.280
 I was preparing for a Pfizer CEO conversation

52:40.280 --> 52:43.080
 and there was a vaccine room and so I joined it.

52:43.080 --> 52:48.080
 And it was a pro science room.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.080
 These are like scientists

52:50.080 --> 52:52.720
 that were calling each other pro science.

52:52.720 --> 52:55.400
 The whole thing was like theater to me.

52:55.400 --> 52:57.200
 I mean, I haven't thoroughly researched,

52:57.200 --> 52:58.240
 but looking at the resume,

52:58.240 --> 53:03.240
 they were like pretty solid researchers and doctors.

53:04.080 --> 53:09.080
 And they were mocking everybody who was at all,

53:10.120 --> 53:11.840
 I mean, it doesn't matter what they stood for,

53:11.840 --> 53:13.240
 but they were just mocking people

53:13.240 --> 53:15.880
 and the arrogance was overwhelming.

53:15.880 --> 53:18.920
 I had to shut off because I couldn't handle

53:18.920 --> 53:21.440
 that human beings can be like this to each other.

53:21.440 --> 53:24.480
 And then I went back just to double check,

53:24.480 --> 53:25.480
 is this really happening?

53:25.480 --> 53:26.920
 How many people are here?

53:26.920 --> 53:28.440
 Is this theater?

53:28.440 --> 53:31.520
 And then I asked to come on stage on Clubhouse

53:31.520 --> 53:32.720
 to make a couple of comments.

53:32.720 --> 53:36.200
 And then as I opened my mouth, I said, thank you so much.

53:36.200 --> 53:39.920
 This is a great room, sort of the usual civil politeness,

53:39.920 --> 53:41.720
 all that kind of stuff.

53:41.720 --> 53:46.720
 And I said, I'm worried that the kind of arrogance

53:47.780 --> 53:51.560
 with which things are being discussed here

53:51.560 --> 53:55.440
 will further divide us, not unite us.

53:55.440 --> 54:00.440
 And before I said even the unite us, further divide us,

54:00.460 --> 54:02.300
 I was thrown off stage.

54:02.300 --> 54:04.340
 Now, this isn't why I mentioned platform,

54:04.340 --> 54:08.880
 but like I am like Lex Friedman, MIT,

54:08.880 --> 54:11.960
 also, which is something those people seem

54:11.960 --> 54:15.760
 to sometimes care about, followers and stuff like that.

54:15.760 --> 54:18.200
 Like, did you just do that?

54:18.200 --> 54:21.100
 And then they said, enough of that nonsense.

54:21.100 --> 54:22.760
 Enough of that nonsense.

54:22.760 --> 54:27.420
 They said to me, enough of that nonsense.

54:27.420 --> 54:31.540
 Somebody who is obviously interviewed, Francis Collins,

54:31.540 --> 54:35.040
 is the Pfizer CEO.

54:35.040 --> 54:37.780
 To bring you on, French epidemiologist also, so just.

54:37.780 --> 54:38.780
 Yeah, exactly.

54:38.780 --> 54:40.760
 But this broke my heart, the arrogance.

54:40.760 --> 54:43.160
 And this is, echoes of that arrogance

54:43.160 --> 54:44.520
 is something you see in this email.

54:44.520 --> 54:47.000
 And I really would love to have a million things

54:47.000 --> 54:48.600
 to talk about to try to figure out

54:48.600 --> 54:50.420
 how can we find a path forward?

54:50.420 --> 54:54.240
 I think a lot of the problems we've seen

54:54.240 --> 54:57.000
 in the discussion over COVID,

54:57.000 --> 54:59.600
 and especially in the scientific community,

54:59.600 --> 55:02.400
 there's two ways to look at science, I think,

55:02.400 --> 55:05.240
 that have been competing with each other for a while now.

55:05.240 --> 55:08.800
 One way, and this is the way that I view science

55:08.800 --> 55:10.920
 and why I've always found it so attractive,

55:10.920 --> 55:14.200
 is an invitation to a structured discussion

55:14.200 --> 55:18.080
 where the discussion is tempered by evidence,

55:18.080 --> 55:22.040
 by data, by reasoning and logic, right?

55:22.040 --> 55:25.240
 So it's a dialectical process where if I believe A

55:25.240 --> 55:29.560
 and you believe B, well, we talk about it.

55:29.560 --> 55:30.760
 We come up with an experiment

55:30.760 --> 55:32.640
 that distinguishes between the two.

55:32.640 --> 55:34.920
 And while B turns out to be right,

55:34.920 --> 55:37.100
 I'm all frustrated, but I buy you dinner

55:37.100 --> 55:38.480
 and I say, no, no, no, no, C.

55:38.480 --> 55:40.880
 And then we go on from there, right?

55:40.880 --> 55:43.320
 That's what science is at its best.

55:43.320 --> 55:46.400
 It's this process of using data in discussion.

55:46.400 --> 55:48.680
 It's a human activity, right?

55:48.680 --> 55:53.680
 To learn, to have the truth unfold itself before us.

55:54.200 --> 55:57.380
 On the other hand, there's another way

55:57.380 --> 55:59.800
 that people have used science or thought about science

55:59.800 --> 56:03.360
 as truth in and of itself, right?

56:03.360 --> 56:07.080
 Like if it's science, therefore it's true automatically.

56:07.080 --> 56:10.320
 And what does the science say to do?

56:10.320 --> 56:12.280
 Well, the science never says to do anything.

56:12.280 --> 56:13.760
 The science says, here's what's true.

56:13.760 --> 56:17.840
 And then we have to apply our human values to say,

56:17.840 --> 56:21.880
 okay, well, if we do this, then this is likely to happen.

56:21.880 --> 56:23.100
 That's what the science says.

56:23.100 --> 56:25.080
 If we do that, then that is likely to happen.

56:25.080 --> 56:27.520
 Well, we'd rather have this than that, right?

56:27.520 --> 56:29.420
 But science doesn't tell us

56:29.420 --> 56:30.440
 that we'd rather have this than that.

56:30.440 --> 56:31.700
 It's our human values that tell us

56:31.700 --> 56:32.560
 that we'd rather have this than that.

56:32.560 --> 56:35.120
 Science plays a role, but it's not the only thing.

56:36.040 --> 56:36.920
 It's not the only role.

56:36.920 --> 56:40.120
 It's like, it helps understand the constraints we face,

56:40.120 --> 56:41.600
 but it doesn't tell us what to do

56:41.600 --> 56:43.260
 in face of those constraints.

56:43.260 --> 56:45.640
 But underneath it, at the individual level,

56:45.640 --> 56:46.840
 at the institutional level,

56:46.840 --> 56:51.840
 it seems like arrogance is really destructive.

56:52.640 --> 56:55.800
 So the flip side of that, the productive thing is humility.

56:55.800 --> 57:02.800
 So sort of always not being sure that you're right.

57:03.060 --> 57:05.120
 This is actually kind of,

57:05.120 --> 57:07.720
 Stuart Russell talks about this for AI research.

57:07.720 --> 57:09.480
 How do you make sure that AI,

57:09.480 --> 57:11.360
 super intelligent AI doesn't destroy us?

57:11.360 --> 57:15.400
 You built in a sort of module within it

57:15.400 --> 57:18.560
 that it always doubts its actions.

57:18.560 --> 57:20.160
 Like, it's not sure.

57:20.160 --> 57:23.200
 Like, I know it says I'm supposed to destroy all humans,

57:23.200 --> 57:24.800
 but maybe I'm wrong.

57:24.800 --> 57:27.860
 And that maybe I'm wrong is essential for progress,

57:27.860 --> 57:30.840
 for actually doing in the long arc of history better,

57:30.840 --> 57:31.760
 not the perfect thing,

57:31.760 --> 57:33.480
 but better and better and better and better.

57:33.480 --> 57:37.840
 I mean, the question I have here for you is this,

57:37.840 --> 57:41.920
 this email so clearly captures some maybe echo,

57:41.920 --> 57:44.240
 but maybe a core to the problem.

57:44.240 --> 57:47.040
 Do you put responsibility of this email,

57:47.040 --> 57:49.920
 of the shortcomings and failures

57:49.920 --> 57:52.060
 on individuals or institutions?

57:52.060 --> 57:53.680
 Is this Francis Collins, Anthony?

57:53.680 --> 57:55.320
 No, this is an institutional failure, right?

57:55.320 --> 57:59.180
 So the NIH, so I've had two decades of NIH funding.

57:59.180 --> 58:01.200
 I've sat on NIH review panels.

58:01.200 --> 58:03.800
 The purpose of the NIH is what you said earlier, Lex.

58:03.800 --> 58:08.080
 The purpose of the NIH is to support the work of scientists.

58:08.080 --> 58:10.640
 To some extent, it's also to help scientists,

58:10.640 --> 58:12.760
 to direct scientists to work on things

58:12.760 --> 58:14.520
 that are very important for public health

58:14.520 --> 58:16.120
 or for the health of the public.

58:17.160 --> 58:18.740
 So, and the way you do that is you say,

58:18.740 --> 58:21.600
 okay, we're gonna put $50 million

58:21.600 --> 58:24.480
 on the research in Alzheimer's disease this year

58:24.480 --> 58:27.240
 or $70 million on HIV or whatever it is, right?

58:27.240 --> 58:30.920
 And that pot of money then scientists compete

58:30.920 --> 58:33.440
 with each other for the best ideas to use it

58:33.440 --> 58:36.140
 to address that problem.

58:36.140 --> 58:38.400
 So it's essentially an endeavor

58:38.400 --> 58:40.320
 to support the work of scientists.

58:40.320 --> 58:45.060
 It is not in and of itself a policy organ.

58:45.060 --> 58:48.240
 It doesn't say what public health policy should be.

58:48.240 --> 58:53.240
 For that, you have the CDC and what happened

58:53.940 --> 58:58.660
 during the pandemic is that people in the NIH

58:58.660 --> 59:01.620
 were called upon to contribute

59:01.620 --> 59:03.720
 to public health policymaking.

59:04.860 --> 59:06.860
 And that created the conflict of interest

59:06.860 --> 59:09.020
 you see in that email, right?

59:09.020 --> 59:13.780
 So now you have the head of the NIH in effect saying

59:13.780 --> 59:17.020
 to all scientists, you must agree with me

59:17.020 --> 59:19.020
 in the policy that I've recommended

59:20.900 --> 59:22.100
 or else you're a fringe.

59:23.580 --> 59:25.300
 That is a deep conflict of interest.

59:25.300 --> 59:27.420
 It's deep because first he's conflicted.

59:27.420 --> 59:31.580
 He has this dual role as the head of the NIH,

59:31.580 --> 59:33.060
 supporter of scientific funding

59:33.060 --> 59:35.900
 and then also inappropriately called

59:35.900 --> 59:39.420
 to set or help set pandemic policy.

59:39.420 --> 59:40.860
 That should never have happened.

59:40.860 --> 59:44.340
 There should be a bright line between those two roles.

59:44.340 --> 59:47.180
 Let me ask you about just Francis Collins.

59:47.180 --> 59:49.820
 I had a chance to talk to him on a podcast.

59:49.820 --> 59:51.140
 I don't know if you maybe by chance

59:51.140 --> 59:52.780
 gotten a chance to hear a few words.

59:52.780 --> 59:54.400
 I heard some of it, yeah.

59:54.400 --> 59:56.760
 Well, I have kind of a question to that

59:56.760 --> 1:00:01.380
 because a lot of people wrote to me quite negative things

1:00:01.380 --> 1:00:03.420
 about Francis Collins and like I said,

1:00:03.420 --> 1:00:06.940
 I still believe he's a great man and a great scientist.

1:00:09.340 --> 1:00:13.420
 One of the things when I talked to him off mic

1:00:13.420 --> 1:00:14.800
 about the vaccine,

1:00:16.860 --> 1:00:21.260
 the excitement he had about when we were recollecting

1:00:21.260 --> 1:00:23.540
 when they first gotten an inkling

1:00:23.540 --> 1:00:26.900
 that it's actually going to be possible to get a vaccine,

1:00:26.900 --> 1:00:28.900
 just he wasn't messaging,

1:00:28.900 --> 1:00:31.300
 just in the private or of our own conversation,

1:00:31.300 --> 1:00:34.180
 he was really excited and why was he excited?

1:00:34.180 --> 1:00:36.500
 Because he gets to help a lot of people.

1:00:36.500 --> 1:00:40.560
 This is a man that really wants to help people

1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:43.660
 and there could be some institutional self delusion,

1:00:43.660 --> 1:00:45.660
 the arrogance, all those kinds of things

1:00:45.660 --> 1:00:47.220
 that lead to this kind of email.

1:00:47.220 --> 1:00:49.340
 But ultimately the goal is this,

1:00:49.340 --> 1:00:51.780
 I don't think people quite realize this.

1:00:51.780 --> 1:00:55.060
 The reason he would call you a fringe epidemiologist,

1:00:55.060 --> 1:00:58.100
 the reason there needs to be a devastating published

1:00:58.100 --> 1:01:01.860
 take down, he, I believe really believes

1:01:01.860 --> 1:01:05.380
 that it could be very dangerous

1:01:05.380 --> 1:01:09.360
 and it's a lot of burden to carry on his shoulders

1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:11.140
 because like you said, in his role

1:01:11.140 --> 1:01:13.460
 where he defines some of the public policy,

1:01:16.260 --> 1:01:19.020
 depending on how he thinks about the world,

1:01:19.020 --> 1:01:20.300
 millions of people could die

1:01:20.300 --> 1:01:22.820
 because of one decision he make.

1:01:22.820 --> 1:01:24.700
 And that's a lot of burden to walk with.

1:01:24.700 --> 1:01:25.940
 Yeah, no, I think that's right.

1:01:25.940 --> 1:01:29.420
 I don't think that he has bad intentions.

1:01:29.420 --> 1:01:31.980
 I think that he was basically put,

1:01:31.980 --> 1:01:34.380
 was put or maybe put himself in a position

1:01:34.380 --> 1:01:38.060
 where this kind of conflict of interest

1:01:38.060 --> 1:01:42.700
 was going to create this kind of reaction, right?

1:01:42.700 --> 1:01:44.540
 The kind of humility that you're calling for

1:01:44.540 --> 1:01:48.100
 is almost impossible when you have that dual role

1:01:48.100 --> 1:01:51.380
 that you shouldn't have as funder of science

1:01:51.380 --> 1:01:53.460
 and also setter of scientific policy.

1:01:53.460 --> 1:01:54.500
 I agree with everything you just said,

1:01:54.500 --> 1:01:55.700
 except the last part.

1:01:55.700 --> 1:01:58.100
 The humility is almost impossible.

1:02:00.100 --> 1:02:01.640
 Humility is always difficult.

1:02:01.640 --> 1:02:04.740
 I think there's a huge incentive

1:02:04.740 --> 1:02:06.700
 for humility in that position.

1:02:06.700 --> 1:02:08.520
 Now look at history.

1:02:08.520 --> 1:02:13.520
 Great leaders that have humility are popular as hell.

1:02:14.460 --> 1:02:16.760
 So if you like being popular,

1:02:16.760 --> 1:02:19.660
 if you like having impact, legacy,

1:02:19.660 --> 1:02:22.220
 these descendants of ape seem to care about legacy,

1:02:22.220 --> 1:02:25.980
 especially as they get older in these high positions.

1:02:25.980 --> 1:02:28.380
 I think the incentive for humility is pretty high.

1:02:28.380 --> 1:02:30.340
 Well, the thing is there's a lot

1:02:30.340 --> 1:02:32.300
 that he has to be proud of in his career.

1:02:32.300 --> 1:02:34.540
 I mean, the Human Genome Project

1:02:34.540 --> 1:02:36.260
 wouldn't have happened without him.

1:02:36.260 --> 1:02:39.460
 And he is a great man and a great scientist.

1:02:39.460 --> 1:02:41.660
 So it is tragic to me that his career

1:02:41.660 --> 1:02:43.260
 has ended in this particular way.

1:02:44.820 --> 1:02:46.060
 Can I ask you a question

1:02:46.060 --> 1:02:50.700
 about my podcast conversation with him?

1:02:50.700 --> 1:02:53.240
 By way of advice or maybe criticism,

1:02:54.380 --> 1:02:56.260
 there's a lot of people that wrote to me

1:02:56.260 --> 1:03:00.020
 kind words of support and a lot of people

1:03:00.020 --> 1:03:03.340
 that wrote to me respectful, constructive criticism.

1:03:03.340 --> 1:03:06.180
 How would you suggest to have conversations

1:03:06.180 --> 1:03:07.820
 with folks like that?

1:03:07.820 --> 1:03:11.020
 And maybe, I mean,

1:03:11.020 --> 1:03:12.900
 because I have other conversations like this,

1:03:12.900 --> 1:03:17.380
 including I was debating whether to talk to Anthony Fauci.

1:03:17.380 --> 1:03:19.220
 He wanted to talk.

1:03:19.220 --> 1:03:22.820
 And so what kind of conversation do you have?

1:03:22.820 --> 1:03:24.620
 And sorry to take us on a tangent,

1:03:24.620 --> 1:03:27.300
 but almost from an interview perspective

1:03:27.300 --> 1:03:31.780
 of how to inspire humility and inspire trust in science

1:03:31.780 --> 1:03:34.460
 or maybe give hope that we know what the heck we're doing

1:03:34.460 --> 1:03:35.700
 and we're gonna figure this out?

1:03:35.700 --> 1:03:38.460
 I mean, I think you're,

1:03:38.460 --> 1:03:41.220
 I've had been now interviewed by many people.

1:03:41.220 --> 1:03:44.460
 I think the style you have really works well, Lex.

1:03:44.460 --> 1:03:45.540
 You have to,

1:03:45.540 --> 1:03:48.980
 because I don't think you're gonna be ever an attack dog

1:03:48.980 --> 1:03:53.260
 trying to go after somebody and force them to like,

1:03:53.260 --> 1:03:55.780
 sort of admit that they were wrong or whatever about,

1:03:55.780 --> 1:03:58.740
 I mean, I also actually find that form of journalism

1:03:58.740 --> 1:04:00.500
 and podcasting really off putting.

1:04:00.500 --> 1:04:02.180
 It's hard to watch.

1:04:02.180 --> 1:04:04.100
 Also, it's a whole other tangent.

1:04:04.100 --> 1:04:05.380
 Is that actually effective?

1:04:05.380 --> 1:04:06.220
 I don't think so.

1:04:06.220 --> 1:04:09.140
 Do you wanna ask Hitler,

1:04:09.140 --> 1:04:11.020
 and I think about this a lot, actually interviewing Hitler.

1:04:11.020 --> 1:04:13.620
 I've been studying a lot about the rise and fall

1:04:13.620 --> 1:04:15.140
 of the Third Reich.

1:04:15.140 --> 1:04:16.660
 I think about interviewing Stalin.

1:04:16.660 --> 1:04:18.540
 Like I put myself in that mindset,

1:04:18.540 --> 1:04:22.700
 like how do you have conversations with people

1:04:22.700 --> 1:04:24.900
 to understand who they are so that,

1:04:24.900 --> 1:04:28.220
 not so you can sit there and yell at them,

1:04:28.220 --> 1:04:29.340
 but to understand who they are

1:04:29.340 --> 1:04:32.420
 so that you can inspire a very large number of people

1:04:32.420 --> 1:04:33.940
 to be the best version of themselves

1:04:33.940 --> 1:04:36.220
 and to avoid the mistakes of the past.

1:04:36.220 --> 1:04:39.700
 I believe that everyone that's involved in this debate

1:04:39.700 --> 1:04:41.180
 has good intentions.

1:04:41.180 --> 1:04:44.060
 They're coming at it from their points of view.

1:04:44.060 --> 1:04:48.180
 They have their weaknesses.

1:04:48.180 --> 1:04:50.820
 And if you can paint a picture in your questioning

1:04:50.820 --> 1:04:55.180
 by sympathetic questioning of those strengths and weaknesses

1:04:55.180 --> 1:04:57.340
 and their point of view, you've done a service.

1:04:57.340 --> 1:05:00.180
 That's really all I personally like to see

1:05:00.180 --> 1:05:02.100
 in those kinds of interviews.

1:05:02.100 --> 1:05:06.700
 I don't think a gotcha moment is really the key thing there.

1:05:06.700 --> 1:05:09.340
 The key thing is understanding where they're coming from,

1:05:09.340 --> 1:05:10.660
 understanding their thinking,

1:05:10.660 --> 1:05:12.340
 understanding the constraints they faced

1:05:12.340 --> 1:05:14.140
 and how did they manage them.

1:05:14.140 --> 1:05:15.700
 That's gonna provide a much,

1:05:15.700 --> 1:05:17.100
 I mean, to me, that's what I look for

1:05:17.100 --> 1:05:19.860
 when I listen to podcasts like yours,

1:05:19.860 --> 1:05:24.660
 is an understanding of that person and the moment

1:05:24.660 --> 1:05:26.300
 and how they dealt with it.

1:05:26.300 --> 1:05:30.580
 I mean, I guess the hope is to discover in a sympathetic way

1:05:30.580 --> 1:05:33.820
 a flaw in a person's thinking together.

1:05:33.820 --> 1:05:37.140
 Like as opposed to discovering the positive thing together,

1:05:37.140 --> 1:05:39.620
 you discover the thing, well,

1:05:39.620 --> 1:05:40.860
 I didn't really think about that.

1:05:40.860 --> 1:05:42.940
 Yeah, I mean, that's how science is, right?

1:05:42.940 --> 1:05:46.160
 That's why we find it so attractive is this,

1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:51.160
 I like it when a student shows me I'm thinking incorrectly.

1:05:51.540 --> 1:05:53.960
 Right, I'm really grateful to that student

1:05:53.960 --> 1:05:57.300
 because now I have an opportunity to change my mind about it

1:05:57.300 --> 1:05:58.980
 and then start thinking even more correctly.

1:05:58.980 --> 1:06:02.860
 I mean, and there are moments when,

1:06:02.860 --> 1:06:05.020
 I mean, like this is probably a good time to say

1:06:05.020 --> 1:06:07.920
 like what I think I got wrong during the pandemic, right?

1:06:07.920 --> 1:06:10.660
 So like for instance, you said Francis Collins had a moment

1:06:10.660 --> 1:06:14.780
 when he learned that there was quite possible

1:06:14.780 --> 1:06:16.620
 to get a vaccine going.

1:06:16.620 --> 1:06:19.060
 He must've learned that quite early.

1:06:19.060 --> 1:06:21.520
 And I didn't learn that early.

1:06:21.520 --> 1:06:25.060
 I mean, I didn't know, in March of 2020,

1:06:25.940 --> 1:06:28.140
 in my experience with vaccine development,

1:06:28.140 --> 1:06:30.740
 it would've take, I thought it would take a decade or more

1:06:30.740 --> 1:06:31.680
 to get a vaccine.

1:06:33.020 --> 1:06:34.220
 That was wrong, right?

1:06:34.220 --> 1:06:38.020
 I didn't, and I was so happy

1:06:38.020 --> 1:06:40.420
 when I started to see the preliminary numbers

1:06:40.420 --> 1:06:43.940
 in the Pfizer trial that strongly suggested

1:06:43.940 --> 1:06:44.980
 it was going to work.

1:06:46.340 --> 1:06:49.700
 And I was, I mean, like very few times in my life

1:06:49.700 --> 1:06:50.980
 I'm so happy to be wrong.

1:06:50.980 --> 1:06:55.480
 And it changes kind of, I think I've heard you mention

1:06:55.480 --> 1:06:58.180
 that a lockdown is still a bad idea

1:06:58.180 --> 1:07:01.800
 unless the vaccine comes out in like tomorrow.

1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:05.300
 There's still like suffering and economic pain,

1:07:05.300 --> 1:07:07.100
 all kinds of pain can still happen

1:07:07.100 --> 1:07:10.100
 in even just a scale of weeks versus months.

1:07:13.180 --> 1:07:14.100
 Yeah.

1:07:14.100 --> 1:07:16.320
 Well, let's talk about the vaccine.

1:07:16.320 --> 1:07:18.940
 What are your thoughts on the safety and efficacy

1:07:18.940 --> 1:07:22.900
 of COVID vaccines at the individual and the societal level?

1:07:22.900 --> 1:07:26.220
 So for the vaccine safety data,

1:07:26.220 --> 1:07:30.100
 it's actually challenging to convey to the public

1:07:30.100 --> 1:07:31.460
 how this is normally done.

1:07:31.460 --> 1:07:34.400
 Like normally you would do this in the context of the trial,

1:07:34.400 --> 1:07:37.020
 you'd have a long trial with large numbers,

1:07:37.020 --> 1:07:38.700
 relatively large numbers of people,

1:07:38.700 --> 1:07:40.100
 you'd follow them over a long time

1:07:40.100 --> 1:07:42.380
 and the trial will give you some indication

1:07:42.380 --> 1:07:43.740
 of the safety of the vaccine.

1:07:43.740 --> 1:07:47.620
 And it did, I mean, but the trial,

1:07:47.620 --> 1:07:51.180
 the way it was constructed, when it came out

1:07:51.180 --> 1:07:52.780
 that it was protective against COVID,

1:07:52.780 --> 1:07:55.180
 it was no longer ethical to have a placebo arm.

1:07:56.340 --> 1:07:59.140
 And so that placebo arm was vaccinated, large part of it.

1:08:00.140 --> 1:08:02.280
 And so that meant that from the trial,

1:08:02.280 --> 1:08:05.180
 you were not going to be able to get data

1:08:05.180 --> 1:08:07.680
 on the longterm safety profiles of the vaccine.

1:08:09.380 --> 1:08:10.900
 And also the other thing about trials,

1:08:10.900 --> 1:08:13.020
 although there's tens of thousands of people enrolled,

1:08:13.020 --> 1:08:14.460
 that's still not enough to get

1:08:14.460 --> 1:08:18.940
 when you deploy a vaccine at population scale,

1:08:18.940 --> 1:08:21.220
 you're gonna see things that weren't in the trial,

1:08:21.220 --> 1:08:23.820
 guaranteed, populations of people

1:08:23.820 --> 1:08:25.740
 that weren't represented well in the trial

1:08:25.740 --> 1:08:27.860
 are gonna be given the vaccine

1:08:27.860 --> 1:08:29.980
 and then they're gonna have things that happen to them

1:08:29.980 --> 1:08:32.260
 that you didn't anticipate.

1:08:32.260 --> 1:08:35.580
 So I wasn't surprised when people were a little bit

1:08:35.580 --> 1:08:38.580
 skeptical when the trial was done about the safety profile,

1:08:38.580 --> 1:08:40.700
 just the way the nature of the thing was gonna make it

1:08:40.700 --> 1:08:43.660
 so that it was gonna be hard to get a complete picture

1:08:43.660 --> 1:08:45.120
 from the trials itself.

1:08:45.120 --> 1:08:47.540
 And the trial showed they were pretty safe

1:08:47.540 --> 1:08:51.300
 and quite effective at preventing both you

1:08:51.300 --> 1:08:52.580
 from getting COVID,

1:08:52.580 --> 1:08:54.900
 like I said, I think the main endpoint of the trial itself

1:08:54.900 --> 1:08:57.840
 was a symptomatic COVID, right?

1:08:57.840 --> 1:09:02.840
 So that was like, that was, I mean, it was really to me,

1:09:03.660 --> 1:09:06.620
 like it was about as amazing achievement as anything,

1:09:06.620 --> 1:09:10.740
 organizing a trial of that scale and running it so quickly.

1:09:10.740 --> 1:09:14.420
 And the final results being so surprisingly high.

1:09:14.420 --> 1:09:16.060
 So good, right?

1:09:16.060 --> 1:09:20.060
 And so, but the problem then was,

1:09:20.060 --> 1:09:23.020
 normally it would take a long time,

1:09:23.020 --> 1:09:25.460
 the FDA would tell Pfizer to go back

1:09:25.460 --> 1:09:27.140
 and try it in this subgroup,

1:09:27.140 --> 1:09:28.660
 they'd work more on dosing,

1:09:28.660 --> 1:09:31.060
 they do all these kinds of things

1:09:31.060 --> 1:09:33.340
 that kind of didn't, we really didn't have time for

1:09:33.340 --> 1:09:34.800
 in the middle of the pandemic, right?

1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:39.800
 So you have a basis for approval that it's less full

1:09:40.940 --> 1:09:44.120
 than normally you would have for a population scale vaccine.

1:09:44.120 --> 1:09:47.520
 But the results were good, the results looked really good.

1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:49.960
 And actually, I should say for the most part,

1:09:49.960 --> 1:09:53.000
 that's been born out when we've given the vaccine at scale

1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:56.760
 in terms of protection against severe disease, right?

1:09:56.760 --> 1:09:59.340
 So people who have got the vaccine

1:09:59.340 --> 1:10:01.240
 for a very long time after they've had

1:10:01.240 --> 1:10:04.520
 for the full vaccination have had great protection

1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:08.480
 against being hospitalized and dying if they get COVID.

1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:11.460
 Let's separate, because this seems to be,

1:10:11.460 --> 1:10:16.060
 there's critics of both categories, but different.

1:10:16.060 --> 1:10:20.940
 Kids and kids, not older people,

1:10:20.940 --> 1:10:24.340
 like let's say five years old and above or something,

1:10:24.340 --> 1:10:26.060
 or 13 years old and above.

1:10:26.060 --> 1:10:31.060
 So for those, it seems like the reduction

1:10:31.500 --> 1:10:35.940
 of the rate of fatalities and serious illness

1:10:35.940 --> 1:10:38.280
 seems to be something like 10X.

1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:42.300
 I mean, for older people, it is a godsend, this vaccine.

1:10:42.300 --> 1:10:47.020
 It transforms the problem of focus protection

1:10:47.020 --> 1:10:49.220
 from something that's quite challenging,

1:10:49.220 --> 1:10:50.820
 possible, I believe, but quite challenging

1:10:50.820 --> 1:10:53.180
 to something that's much, much more manageable.

1:10:53.180 --> 1:10:56.180
 Because the vaccine in and of itself when deployed

1:10:56.180 --> 1:10:58.800
 in older populations is a form of focus protection.

1:11:00.020 --> 1:11:03.340
 Yes, by the way, we'll talk about the focus protection

1:11:03.340 --> 1:11:05.740
 in one segment, because it's such a brilliant idea

1:11:05.740 --> 1:11:08.500
 for this pandemic or for future pandemics.

1:11:08.500 --> 1:11:11.760
 I thought the sociological, psychological discussion

1:11:11.760 --> 1:11:14.060
 about the letter from Francis Collins is,

1:11:15.300 --> 1:11:17.380
 because it was so recent, it has been so troubling to me,

1:11:17.380 --> 1:11:20.220
 so I'm glad we talked about that first.

1:11:20.220 --> 1:11:24.940
 But so there seems to be, the vaccines work

1:11:24.940 --> 1:11:29.340
 to reduce deaths, and that has especially

1:11:29.340 --> 1:11:33.300
 the most transformative effects for the older folks.

1:11:33.300 --> 1:11:35.100
 I've told you one thing that I got wrong in the pandemic.

1:11:35.100 --> 1:11:36.500
 Let me tell you the second thing I got wrong,

1:11:36.500 --> 1:11:38.220
 for sure, in the pandemic.

1:11:38.220 --> 1:11:43.020
 In January of this year, 2021,

1:11:43.020 --> 1:11:46.620
 I thought that the vaccines would stop infection.

1:11:48.060 --> 1:11:48.900
 Yes.

1:11:48.900 --> 1:11:51.620
 Right, it would make it so that you were much less likely

1:11:51.620 --> 1:11:55.260
 to be infected at all, because the antibodies

1:11:55.260 --> 1:11:56.460
 that were produced by the vaccines

1:11:56.460 --> 1:11:58.220
 looked like they were neutralizing antibodies

1:11:58.220 --> 1:12:01.220
 that would essentially block you from being infected at all.

1:12:01.220 --> 1:12:06.220
 That turned out to be wrong, right?

1:12:06.220 --> 1:12:10.660
 So I think, and it became clear as data came out

1:12:10.660 --> 1:12:12.540
 from Israel, which vaccinated very early,

1:12:12.540 --> 1:12:14.860
 that they were seeing surges of infection,

1:12:14.860 --> 1:12:17.820
 even in a very highly vaccinated population,

1:12:17.820 --> 1:12:21.780
 that the vaccine does not stop infection.

1:12:21.780 --> 1:12:24.220
 So you're a used car salesman,

1:12:24.220 --> 1:12:26.180
 and you were selling the vaccine,

1:12:26.180 --> 1:12:28.460
 and the features you thought a vaccine would have,

1:12:28.460 --> 1:12:30.100
 I mean, I have a similar kind of sense

1:12:30.100 --> 1:12:31.660
 when the vaccine came out.

1:12:31.660 --> 1:12:36.660
 Vaccine would reduce, if you somehow were able to get it,

1:12:37.500 --> 1:12:40.300
 it would reduce rate of death and all those kinds of things,

1:12:40.300 --> 1:12:44.260
 but it would also reduce the chance of you getting it,

1:12:44.260 --> 1:12:47.100
 and if you do get it, the chance of you transmitting it

1:12:47.100 --> 1:12:48.860
 to somebody else.

1:12:48.860 --> 1:12:52.180
 And it turns out that those latter two things

1:12:52.180 --> 1:12:55.820
 are not as definitive, or in fact,

1:12:55.820 --> 1:12:57.860
 I mean, I don't know to which degree they're not there at all.

1:12:57.860 --> 1:12:59.260
 I think it's a little complicated,

1:12:59.260 --> 1:13:01.580
 because I think the first two or three months

1:13:01.580 --> 1:13:04.340
 after you're fully vaccinated, after the second dose,

1:13:04.340 --> 1:13:09.340
 you have 60, 70% efficacy peak against infection.

1:13:10.420 --> 1:13:12.740
 So that, which is pretty good, I mean, right?

1:13:12.740 --> 1:13:16.780
 But by six, seven, eight months, that drops to 20%.

1:13:16.780 --> 1:13:19.180
 Some places, some studies, like there's a study

1:13:19.180 --> 1:13:21.540
 out of Sweden that suggests it might even drop to zero.

1:13:21.540 --> 1:13:23.420
 But, and then you're also infectious

1:13:23.420 --> 1:13:25.740
 for some period of time, if you do get it,

1:13:25.740 --> 1:13:27.020
 even though you're vaccinated.

1:13:27.020 --> 1:13:27.860
 Correct.

1:13:27.860 --> 1:13:30.820
 It seems to be lucidated that the period of time

1:13:30.820 --> 1:13:31.860
 your infectious is shorter.

1:13:31.860 --> 1:13:36.500
 Is shorter, but the infectivity per day is about as high.

1:13:36.500 --> 1:13:39.340
 So you still, the point is that the vaccine

1:13:39.340 --> 1:13:41.820
 might reduce some risk of infecting others,

1:13:41.820 --> 1:13:44.820
 but it's not a categorical difference.

1:13:44.820 --> 1:13:49.660
 So, it's not safe to be in the presence

1:13:49.660 --> 1:13:51.220
 of just vaccinated people.

1:13:51.220 --> 1:13:52.660
 You can still get infected.

1:13:53.860 --> 1:13:56.180
 Right, so, I mean, there's a million things

1:13:56.180 --> 1:13:59.700
 I wanna ask here, but is there in some sense

1:13:59.700 --> 1:14:04.020
 because the vaccine really helps

1:14:04.020 --> 1:14:06.820
 on the worst part of this pandemic,

1:14:06.820 --> 1:14:08.300
 which is killing people.

1:14:08.300 --> 1:14:09.940
 Yes.

1:14:09.940 --> 1:14:14.340
 Doesn't that mean, where does the vaccine hesitancy

1:14:14.340 --> 1:14:17.640
 come from in terms of, it seems like,

1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:20.560
 obviously a vaccine is a powerful solution

1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:22.540
 to let us open this thing up.

1:14:22.540 --> 1:14:24.540
 Yeah, so I wrote a Wall Street Journal op ed

1:14:24.540 --> 1:14:26.980
 with Sunetra Gupta in December of last year.

1:14:26.980 --> 1:14:27.820
 Yes.

1:14:27.820 --> 1:14:29.780
 A very night with a very naive title,

1:14:29.780 --> 1:14:32.380
 which says we can end the lockdowns in a month.

1:14:32.380 --> 1:14:33.860
 And the idea is very simple.

1:14:33.860 --> 1:14:37.780
 Vaccinate all vulnerable people

1:14:39.220 --> 1:14:40.700
 and then open up.

1:14:40.700 --> 1:14:41.540
 Open up.

1:14:41.540 --> 1:14:44.660
 Right, and the idea was that the lockdown harms,

1:14:44.660 --> 1:14:47.100
 this is directly related to the Great Barrington Declaration.

1:14:47.100 --> 1:14:49.500
 Great Barrington Declaration said the lockdown harms

1:14:49.500 --> 1:14:53.240
 are devastating to the population at large.

1:14:53.240 --> 1:14:55.980
 There's this considerable segment of people

1:14:55.980 --> 1:14:58.340
 that are vulnerable, protect them.

1:14:58.340 --> 1:15:00.300
 Well, with the vaccine, we have a perfect tool

1:15:00.300 --> 1:15:02.740
 to protect the vulnerable, which is, I still believe,

1:15:02.740 --> 1:15:04.300
 I mean, it's true, right?

1:15:04.300 --> 1:15:07.180
 You vaccinate the vulnerable, the older population,

1:15:07.180 --> 1:15:09.380
 and as you said, there's a tenfold decrease

1:15:09.380 --> 1:15:13.180
 in the mortality risk from getting infected,

1:15:13.180 --> 1:15:14.980
 which is, I mean, amazing.

1:15:14.980 --> 1:15:17.240
 So that was the strategy we outlined.

1:15:17.240 --> 1:15:20.480
 What happened is that the vaccine debate got transformed.

1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:22.860
 So first there's, so you're asking about vaccine hesitancy.

1:15:22.860 --> 1:15:27.020
 I think first there's the inherent limitations

1:15:27.020 --> 1:15:29.460
 of how to measure vaccine safety, right?

1:15:29.460 --> 1:15:31.620
 So we talked about a little bit about the trial,

1:15:31.620 --> 1:15:35.140
 but also after the trial, there's a mechanism,

1:15:35.140 --> 1:15:37.940
 and this is the work I've been involved with before COVID,

1:15:37.940 --> 1:15:42.460
 on tracking and identifying and checking

1:15:42.460 --> 1:15:43.980
 whether the vaccines actually are safe.

1:15:43.980 --> 1:15:46.400
 And the central challenge is one of causality.

1:15:47.260 --> 1:15:49.460
 So you no longer have the randomized trial,

1:15:50.500 --> 1:15:52.780
 but you wanna know is the vaccine,

1:15:52.780 --> 1:15:56.860
 when it's deployed at scale, causing adverse events.

1:15:57.940 --> 1:16:00.100
 Well, you can't just look at people who are vaccinated

1:16:00.100 --> 1:16:02.100
 and see what adverse events happen,

1:16:02.100 --> 1:16:03.980
 because you don't know what would have happened

1:16:03.980 --> 1:16:06.080
 if the person had not been vaccinated.

1:16:06.980 --> 1:16:09.820
 So you have to have some control group.

1:16:09.820 --> 1:16:12.080
 Now, what happened is there's several systems

1:16:12.080 --> 1:16:14.700
 to check this that the CDC uses.

1:16:14.700 --> 1:16:18.220
 One very commonly known one now is called VAERS,

1:16:18.220 --> 1:16:20.580
 the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.

1:16:20.580 --> 1:16:23.420
 There, anyone who has an adverse event,

1:16:23.420 --> 1:16:26.820
 either a regular person or a doctor can just go report,

1:16:26.820 --> 1:16:28.940
 look, I had the vaccine and two days later I had a headache

1:16:28.940 --> 1:16:32.060
 or whatever it is, the person died

1:16:32.060 --> 1:16:34.280
 a day after I had the vaccine, right?

1:16:34.280 --> 1:16:37.660
 Now, the vaccine was rolled out to older people first,

1:16:38.800 --> 1:16:42.180
 and older people die sometimes with or without the vaccine.

1:16:42.180 --> 1:16:44.740
 So sometimes you'll see someone's vaccinated

1:16:44.740 --> 1:16:46.700
 and a few days later they die.

1:16:46.700 --> 1:16:48.540
 Did the vaccine cause it or something else cause it?

1:16:48.540 --> 1:16:50.320
 Really difficult to tell.

1:16:50.320 --> 1:16:52.460
 In order to tell, you need a control group.

1:16:53.540 --> 1:16:58.540
 For that, there are other systems the FDA and CDC have,

1:16:58.580 --> 1:17:02.360
 like there's one called VSD, Vaccine Safety Datalink.

1:17:02.360 --> 1:17:04.020
 There's another system called BEST,

1:17:05.060 --> 1:17:06.880
 I forget what the acronym is,

1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:11.480
 to essentially to track cohorts of people,

1:17:11.480 --> 1:17:13.940
 vaccinated versus unvaccinated,

1:17:13.940 --> 1:17:15.700
 with as careful of matching as you can do.

1:17:15.700 --> 1:17:17.020
 It's not randomized,

1:17:17.020 --> 1:17:21.380
 and then see if you have safety signals

1:17:21.380 --> 1:17:23.700
 that pop up in the vaccinated

1:17:23.700 --> 1:17:25.900
 relative to the control group unvaccinated.

1:17:27.100 --> 1:17:28.140
 And so that's, for instance,

1:17:28.140 --> 1:17:32.000
 how the myocarditis risk was picked up

1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:34.260
 in especially young men.

1:17:34.260 --> 1:17:38.020
 It's also how the higher risk of blood clots

1:17:38.020 --> 1:17:41.060
 in middle age and older women

1:17:41.060 --> 1:17:42.860
 with the J&J vaccine was picked up.

1:17:43.940 --> 1:17:46.400
 There, what you have are situations

1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:50.460
 where the baseline risk of these outcomes are so low

1:17:50.460 --> 1:17:54.100
 that if you see them in the vaccinated arm at all,

1:17:54.100 --> 1:17:57.420
 that it's not hard to understand that the vaccine did this.

1:17:57.420 --> 1:18:00.540
 Young men should not be having myocarditis.

1:18:00.540 --> 1:18:02.300
 Middle age women should not be having

1:18:02.300 --> 1:18:04.400
 huge blood clots in the brain.

1:18:04.400 --> 1:18:05.900
 So when you see that, you can say it's linked.

1:18:05.900 --> 1:18:07.380
 Now, the rates are low.

1:18:07.380 --> 1:18:09.540
 So young men, maybe one in 5,000,

1:18:09.540 --> 1:18:11.940
 one in 10,000 of the vaccine,

1:18:11.940 --> 1:18:14.180
 vaccine related myocarditis, pericarditis.

1:18:14.180 --> 1:18:17.660
 Young women, middle age women, I don't know.

1:18:17.660 --> 1:18:19.700
 I'm not sure what the right number might be,

1:18:19.700 --> 1:18:23.700
 but like I'd say, it's like one in hundreds of thousands,

1:18:23.700 --> 1:18:24.660
 something like that.

1:18:26.420 --> 1:18:27.900
 So these are rare outcomes,

1:18:27.900 --> 1:18:30.940
 but they are vaccine linked outcomes.

1:18:30.940 --> 1:18:33.780
 How do you deal with that as a messaging thing?

1:18:33.780 --> 1:18:35.380
 I think you just tell people.

1:18:35.380 --> 1:18:36.860
 You tell people here are the risks.

1:18:36.860 --> 1:18:37.860
 You transparently tell them.

1:18:37.860 --> 1:18:38.700
 And just, you're not,

1:18:38.700 --> 1:18:41.200
 so they're not getting into something that they don't know.

1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:45.460
 And don't treat people like they're children

1:18:45.460 --> 1:18:47.300
 and need to be told lies

1:18:47.300 --> 1:18:48.700
 because they won't understand

1:18:48.700 --> 1:18:50.980
 the full complexity of the truth.

1:18:50.980 --> 1:18:54.220
 People, I think, are pretty good at,

1:18:54.220 --> 1:18:59.220
 or actually, people with time are good at understanding data,

1:18:59.660 --> 1:19:01.460
 but better than anything.

1:19:01.460 --> 1:19:04.460
 They're better at,

1:19:04.460 --> 1:19:08.440
 they're extremely good at detecting arrogance and bullshit.

1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:10.780
 And you give them either one of those.

1:19:10.780 --> 1:19:11.700
 I mean, I'll give you one

1:19:11.700 --> 1:19:14.740
 that's where I think it's greatly undermined vaccine,

1:19:14.740 --> 1:19:16.620
 greatly undermined the demand for the vaccine,

1:19:16.620 --> 1:19:20.460
 is this weird denial that if you recover from COVID,

1:19:20.460 --> 1:19:24.100
 you have extremely good immunity,

1:19:24.100 --> 1:19:27.100
 both against infection and access to disease.

1:19:27.100 --> 1:19:31.820
 And that denial leads to people distrusting the message

1:19:31.820 --> 1:19:33.860
 given by like the CDC director, for instance,

1:19:33.860 --> 1:19:35.940
 in favor of the vaccine, right?

1:19:35.940 --> 1:19:39.580
 Why would you deny a thing that's such an obvious fact?

1:19:39.580 --> 1:19:42.060
 Like you can look at the data and it just,

1:19:42.060 --> 1:19:43.700
 I mean, it just pops out at you

1:19:43.700 --> 1:19:45.860
 that people that are COVID recovered

1:19:45.860 --> 1:19:48.760
 are not getting infected again at very high rates,

1:19:48.760 --> 1:19:50.340
 much lower rates.

1:19:50.340 --> 1:19:52.200
 After these kinds of conversations,

1:19:53.020 --> 1:19:55.560
 I'm sure after this very conversation,

1:19:55.560 --> 1:19:59.420
 I often get a number of messages from Joe, Joe Rogan,

1:19:59.420 --> 1:20:03.600
 and from Sam Harris, who to me are people I admire,

1:20:03.600 --> 1:20:06.560
 I think are really intelligent, thoughtful human beings.

1:20:06.560 --> 1:20:08.420
 They also have a platform.

1:20:08.420 --> 1:20:11.140
 And I believe, at least in my mind,

1:20:11.140 --> 1:20:14.120
 about this COVID set of topics,

1:20:14.120 --> 1:20:17.240
 they represent a group of people.

1:20:19.860 --> 1:20:24.400
 Each group has smart, thoughtful,

1:20:25.700 --> 1:20:27.900
 well intentioned human beings.

1:20:27.900 --> 1:20:30.320
 And I don't know who is right,

1:20:30.320 --> 1:20:35.320
 but I do know that they're kind of tribal a little bit,

1:20:36.300 --> 1:20:37.200
 those groups.

1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:41.060
 And so the question I wanna ask is like,

1:20:41.060 --> 1:20:45.020
 what do you think about these two groups

1:20:45.900 --> 1:20:48.860
 and this kind of tension over the vaccine

1:20:49.860 --> 1:20:54.020
 that sometimes it just keeps finding different topics

1:20:54.020 --> 1:20:55.380
 on which to focus on,

1:20:55.380 --> 1:20:57.820
 like whether kids should get vaccinated or not,

1:20:57.820 --> 1:21:00.380
 whether there should be vaccine mandates or not,

1:21:00.380 --> 1:21:03.420
 which seem to be often very kind of specific policy

1:21:03.420 --> 1:21:06.180
 kinds of questions that miss the bigger picture.

1:21:06.180 --> 1:21:08.300
 I think it's a symptom of the distrust

1:21:08.300 --> 1:21:10.460
 that people have in public health.

1:21:10.460 --> 1:21:13.900
 I think this kind of schism over the vaccine

1:21:13.900 --> 1:21:15.300
 does not happen in places

1:21:15.300 --> 1:21:16.580
 where the public health authorities

1:21:16.580 --> 1:21:18.860
 have been much more trustworthy, right?

1:21:18.860 --> 1:21:20.060
 So you don't see this vaccine

1:21:20.060 --> 1:21:21.900
 hasn't seen Sweden, for instance.

1:21:23.620 --> 1:21:25.620
 What's happened in the United States

1:21:25.620 --> 1:21:30.540
 is that the vaccine has become first because of politics,

1:21:30.540 --> 1:21:33.020
 but then also because of the scientific arrogance,

1:21:33.020 --> 1:21:35.100
 this sort of touchstone issue,

1:21:35.100 --> 1:21:37.180
 and people line up on both sides of it,

1:21:37.180 --> 1:21:39.540
 and the different language you're hearing

1:21:39.540 --> 1:21:40.820
 is structured around that.

1:21:40.820 --> 1:21:42.580
 So before the election, for instance,

1:21:42.580 --> 1:21:46.580
 I did a testimony in the House

1:21:46.580 --> 1:21:49.760
 on measurement of vaccine safety.

1:21:49.760 --> 1:21:52.540
 And I was invited by the Republicans.

1:21:52.540 --> 1:21:54.420
 There were, I think, four other experts

1:21:54.420 --> 1:21:55.260
 invited by the Democrats,

1:21:55.260 --> 1:21:57.620
 or three other experts invited by Democrats,

1:21:57.620 --> 1:21:59.220
 each of whom had a lot of experience

1:21:59.220 --> 1:22:00.600
 in measuring vaccine safety.

1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:04.720
 I was really surprised to hear them each doubt

1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:06.860
 whether the FDA would do a reasonable job

1:22:06.860 --> 1:22:08.760
 in assessing vaccine safety,

1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:11.140
 including by people who have long records

1:22:11.140 --> 1:22:12.940
 of working with the FDA.

1:22:12.940 --> 1:22:17.100
 I mean, these are professionals, great scientists,

1:22:17.100 --> 1:22:19.420
 whose main sort of goal in life

1:22:19.420 --> 1:22:22.460
 is to make sure that unsafe vaccines

1:22:22.460 --> 1:22:24.100
 don't get released into the world.

1:22:24.100 --> 1:22:26.420
 And if they are, they get pulled.

1:22:26.420 --> 1:22:28.500
 And they're casting down on the vaccine

1:22:28.500 --> 1:22:32.100
 the ability to track vaccine safety before the election.

1:22:32.100 --> 1:22:34.860
 And then after the election,

1:22:34.860 --> 1:22:38.380
 the rhetoric switched on a dime, right?

1:22:38.380 --> 1:22:40.580
 All of a sudden, it's Republicans that are cast

1:22:40.580 --> 1:22:42.780
 as if they're vaccine hesitant.

1:22:42.780 --> 1:22:46.860
 That kind of political shift, the public notices.

1:22:46.860 --> 1:22:49.340
 If all it takes is an election to change

1:22:49.340 --> 1:22:51.460
 how people talk about the safety of the vaccine,

1:22:51.460 --> 1:22:53.260
 well, we're not talking science anymore,

1:22:53.260 --> 1:22:54.820
 many people think, right?

1:22:54.820 --> 1:22:57.140
 I think that created its hesitancy.

1:22:58.380 --> 1:22:59.740
 The other thing I think,

1:22:59.740 --> 1:23:04.140
 I think the hesitancy,

1:23:04.140 --> 1:23:07.960
 some politicians viewed it as a political,

1:23:07.960 --> 1:23:10.740
 as sort of like a political opportunity

1:23:10.740 --> 1:23:13.200
 to sort of demonize people who are hesitant.

1:23:14.300 --> 1:23:16.820
 And that itself fueled hesitancy, right?

1:23:16.820 --> 1:23:18.620
 Like if you're telling me I'm a rube

1:23:18.620 --> 1:23:19.920
 that just doesn't want the vaccine

1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:20.880
 because I want everyone to die,

1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:23.540
 well, I'm gonna react really negatively.

1:23:25.180 --> 1:23:27.580
 And if you're talking down to me

1:23:27.580 --> 1:23:32.580
 about my legitimate sort of concerns

1:23:32.860 --> 1:23:34.300
 about whether this vaccine is safe to take,

1:23:34.300 --> 1:23:36.540
 I mean, I've heard from women

1:23:36.540 --> 1:23:37.740
 who were thinking about getting pregnant,

1:23:37.740 --> 1:23:38.780
 should I take the vaccine?

1:23:38.780 --> 1:23:39.620
 I don't know.

1:23:39.620 --> 1:23:41.240
 I mean, there are all kinds of questions,

1:23:41.240 --> 1:23:44.240
 legitimate questions that I think

1:23:44.240 --> 1:23:45.900
 should have good data to answer

1:23:45.900 --> 1:23:47.940
 that we don't necessarily have good data to answer.

1:23:47.940 --> 1:23:50.160
 So what do you do in the face of that?

1:23:50.160 --> 1:23:52.980
 Well, one reaction is to pretend

1:23:52.980 --> 1:23:55.460
 like we know for a fact that it's safe

1:23:55.460 --> 1:23:57.700
 when we don't have the data to know for a fact

1:23:57.700 --> 1:23:58.540
 in that particular group

1:23:58.540 --> 1:24:01.880
 with that particular set of clinical circumstances you know.

1:24:01.880 --> 1:24:03.780
 And that I think breeds hesitancy.

1:24:03.780 --> 1:24:05.560
 People can detect that bullshit.

1:24:06.460 --> 1:24:09.320
 Whereas if you just tell people, you know, I don't know.

1:24:09.320 --> 1:24:10.680
 Yeah, leave with humility.

1:24:10.680 --> 1:24:13.360
 Yeah, you will end up with a better result.

1:24:14.620 --> 1:24:15.940
 Let me ask you about,

1:24:15.940 --> 1:24:19.180
 I've recently had a conversation with the Pfizer CEO.

1:24:19.180 --> 1:24:24.180
 This is part therapy session, part advice,

1:24:24.180 --> 1:24:29.180
 because again, I really want us to get through this together

1:24:29.860 --> 1:24:31.640
 and it feels like the division is a thing

1:24:31.640 --> 1:24:35.260
 that prevents us from getting through this together.

1:24:35.260 --> 1:24:38.620
 And once again, just like with Francis Collins,

1:24:38.620 --> 1:24:43.620
 a lot of people wrote to me words of support

1:24:43.660 --> 1:24:47.200
 and a lot of people wrote to me words of criticism.

1:24:48.900 --> 1:24:53.140
 I'm trying to understand the nature of the criticism.

1:24:53.140 --> 1:24:57.540
 So some of the criticism had to do with against the vaccine

1:24:57.540 --> 1:24:58.940
 and those kinds of things.

1:24:58.940 --> 1:25:01.000
 That I have a better understanding of.

1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:06.540
 But some kind of deep distrust of Pfizer.

1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:12.440
 So actually looking at Big Pharma broadly,

1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:18.620
 I'm trying to understand am I so naive

1:25:19.620 --> 1:25:21.540
 that I just don't see it?

1:25:21.540 --> 1:25:26.380
 Because yes, there's corrupt people and they're greedy,

1:25:26.380 --> 1:25:28.900
 they're flawed in all walks of life.

1:25:29.820 --> 1:25:34.820
 But companies do quite an incredible job

1:25:35.740 --> 1:25:37.780
 of taking a good idea at the scale

1:25:37.780 --> 1:25:39.580
 and making some money with that idea.

1:25:39.580 --> 1:25:43.420
 But they are the ones that achieve scale on a good idea.

1:25:43.420 --> 1:25:46.340
 I don't know, it's not obvious to me.

1:25:46.340 --> 1:25:49.780
 I don't see where the manipulation is.

1:25:49.780 --> 1:25:53.820
 So the fear that people have and I talked to Joe

1:25:53.820 --> 1:25:55.020
 about this quite a bit.

1:25:55.020 --> 1:25:57.500
 I think this is a legitimate fear

1:25:57.500 --> 1:26:00.300
 and a fear you should often have

1:26:00.300 --> 1:26:01.780
 that money has influenced,

1:26:01.780 --> 1:26:04.940
 this proportional influence, especially in politics.

1:26:04.940 --> 1:26:09.940
 So the fear is that the policy of the vaccine

1:26:10.560 --> 1:26:13.500
 was connected to the fact that lots of money

1:26:13.500 --> 1:26:16.540
 could be made by manufacturing the vaccine.

1:26:17.540 --> 1:26:19.340
 And I understand that.

1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:22.040
 And it's actually quite a heck of a difficult task

1:26:22.040 --> 1:26:24.580
 to alleviate that concern.

1:26:24.580 --> 1:26:27.900
 Like you really have to be a great man or woman or a leader

1:26:27.900 --> 1:26:30.460
 to convince people that you're not full of shit,

1:26:30.460 --> 1:26:32.700
 that you're not just playing a game on them.

1:26:32.700 --> 1:26:35.280
 I don't know, it's a difficult task.

1:26:35.280 --> 1:26:38.080
 But at the same time, I really don't like

1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:41.820
 the natural distrust every billionaire,

1:26:41.820 --> 1:26:44.180
 distrust everybody who's trying to make money

1:26:44.180 --> 1:26:47.860
 because it feels like under a capitalistic system at least,

1:26:47.860 --> 1:26:50.380
 the way to do a lot of good,

1:26:50.380 --> 1:26:53.260
 like to do good at scale in the world

1:26:53.260 --> 1:26:57.940
 is by being at least in part motivated by profit.

1:26:57.940 --> 1:26:59.360
 I mean, I share your ambivalence, right?

1:26:59.360 --> 1:27:02.860
 So on the one hand, you have a fantastic achievement.

1:27:02.860 --> 1:27:06.720
 The discovery of the vaccine

1:27:06.720 --> 1:27:08.860
 and then the manufacturing at scale

1:27:08.860 --> 1:27:12.660
 so that billions of people can take the vaccine

1:27:12.660 --> 1:27:14.080
 in a relatively short time.

1:27:14.080 --> 1:27:15.700
 That is a remarkable achievement

1:27:15.700 --> 1:27:18.960
 that could not have happened without companies like Pfizer.

1:27:20.340 --> 1:27:21.540
 And on the other hand,

1:27:21.540 --> 1:27:24.760
 there is this sort of corrupting influence of that money.

1:27:25.820 --> 1:27:27.380
 Just to give you one example,

1:27:27.380 --> 1:27:30.260
 there's an enormous controversy over whether

1:27:30.260 --> 1:27:32.820
 relatively inexpensive repurposed drugs

1:27:32.820 --> 1:27:35.720
 can be used to treat the disease.

1:27:38.280 --> 1:27:40.400
 None of, no company like Pfizer

1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:43.020
 has any interest whatsoever in evaluating it.

1:27:43.020 --> 1:27:45.500
 Even Merck, I think it was Merck,

1:27:45.500 --> 1:27:50.420
 that had the patent on ivermectin now expired,

1:27:50.420 --> 1:27:54.460
 has no interest at all in checking to see if it works.

1:27:54.460 --> 1:27:56.680
 Not only do they not have interest,

1:27:57.580 --> 1:28:01.580
 they have a way of talking about people

1:28:01.580 --> 1:28:04.540
 who might have a little bit of interest

1:28:04.540 --> 1:28:06.180
 that's again.

1:28:06.180 --> 1:28:07.020
 Fringe.

1:28:07.980 --> 1:28:09.540
 Full of arrogance.

1:28:09.540 --> 1:28:10.380
 Yeah.

1:28:10.380 --> 1:28:12.920
 And that is what troubles me.

1:28:12.920 --> 1:28:15.660
 Is there not a, it's back to the play of science.

1:28:15.660 --> 1:28:17.700
 It's not, they're not a bit of curiosity.

1:28:17.700 --> 1:28:20.780
 One, okay, one, the natural curiosity of a human being

1:28:20.780 --> 1:28:23.340
 that should always be there and an open mind is.

1:28:23.340 --> 1:28:25.700
 And second, in the case of ivermectin

1:28:25.700 --> 1:28:27.220
 and other things like that,

1:28:27.220 --> 1:28:28.940
 you have to acknowledge

1:28:28.940 --> 1:28:31.500
 that there's a very large number of people

1:28:31.500 --> 1:28:33.580
 who care about this topic.

1:28:33.580 --> 1:28:36.540
 And this is a way to inspire them

1:28:36.540 --> 1:28:38.860
 to also play in the space of science,

1:28:38.860 --> 1:28:39.860
 to inspire them with science.

1:28:39.860 --> 1:28:42.840
 You can't just like dismiss everybody

1:28:42.840 --> 1:28:45.860
 that you can't just dismiss people, period.

1:28:45.860 --> 1:28:46.700
 Yeah.

1:28:46.700 --> 1:28:48.340
 Well, I mean, I think here, take ivermectin, right?

1:28:48.340 --> 1:28:51.700
 There's actually a study funded by the NIH,

1:28:51.700 --> 1:28:56.020
 by Tony Fauci's NIAID and the NIH

1:28:56.020 --> 1:29:01.020
 called ACTIV6 that's a randomized trial of ivermectin.

1:29:02.780 --> 1:29:05.500
 It's due to be completed in March, 2023.

1:29:07.260 --> 1:29:10.940
 So normally when you have private actors

1:29:10.940 --> 1:29:13.740
 like these big drug companies that have no interest

1:29:13.740 --> 1:29:16.660
 in conducting some kind of scientific experiment

1:29:16.660 --> 1:29:18.740
 that would have some public benefit,

1:29:18.740 --> 1:29:20.940
 it's the job of the government,

1:29:20.940 --> 1:29:23.540
 and in this case, the NIH to fund that kind of work.

1:29:24.500 --> 1:29:27.700
 The NIH has been incredibly slow

1:29:29.180 --> 1:29:32.940
 in its evaluations of these repurposed drugs.

1:29:32.940 --> 1:29:37.820
 And it's been left to lots of other private activities

1:29:37.820 --> 1:29:39.620
 of uneven quality.

1:29:39.620 --> 1:29:42.220
 And hence, that's why you have these big fights.

1:29:42.220 --> 1:29:44.220
 Because the data are not solid,

1:29:44.220 --> 1:29:45.940
 you're gonna have these big fights.

1:29:45.940 --> 1:29:50.100
 Yeah, but also, okay, forget the process of science here,

1:29:50.100 --> 1:29:53.580
 the studies, not enough effort being put into the studies,

1:29:53.580 --> 1:29:55.180
 just the way it's being communicated about.

1:29:55.180 --> 1:29:57.520
 Yeah, no, like to horse paste, I mean, come on.

1:29:57.520 --> 1:30:01.780
 The FDA put a tweet out telling people who are like,

1:30:01.780 --> 1:30:02.740
 they're taking ivermectin

1:30:02.740 --> 1:30:04.140
 because they've heard good things about it

1:30:04.140 --> 1:30:06.180
 and they're sick and they're desperate.

1:30:06.180 --> 1:30:09.740
 And to call it horse paste, that was terrible.

1:30:09.740 --> 1:30:10.960
 That was deeply irresponsible.

1:30:10.960 --> 1:30:13.740
 My hope is grounded in the fact

1:30:13.740 --> 1:30:16.540
 that young people see the bullshit of this,

1:30:16.540 --> 1:30:18.700
 young PhD students, graduate students,

1:30:18.700 --> 1:30:20.200
 young students in college,

1:30:20.200 --> 1:30:25.200
 they see the less than stellar way

1:30:25.940 --> 1:30:27.660
 that our scientific leaders

1:30:27.660 --> 1:30:29.380
 and our political leaders are behaving,

1:30:29.380 --> 1:30:30.580
 and then the new generation

1:30:30.580 --> 1:30:33.180
 will not repeat the mistakes of the past.

1:30:33.180 --> 1:30:36.680
 That is my hope, because that's the cool thing I see

1:30:36.680 --> 1:30:40.260
 about young people is they're good at detecting bullshit

1:30:40.260 --> 1:30:42.400
 and they don't want to be part of that.

1:30:43.460 --> 1:30:46.780
 That's my hope in the space of science.

1:30:46.780 --> 1:30:48.460
 Let me return to this idea

1:30:48.460 --> 1:30:50.540
 of the Great Barrington Declaration,

1:30:50.540 --> 1:30:52.660
 return to the beginning.

1:30:52.660 --> 1:30:54.760
 So what are the basics?

1:30:54.760 --> 1:30:57.280
 Can you describe what the Great Barrington Declaration is?

1:30:57.280 --> 1:30:58.660
 What are some of the ideas in it?

1:30:58.660 --> 1:31:01.520
 You mentioned focused protection.

1:31:01.520 --> 1:31:04.460
 What are your concerns about lockdowns?

1:31:04.460 --> 1:31:07.380
 Just paint the picture of this early proposal.

1:31:07.380 --> 1:31:09.260
 Sure, so the Great Barrington Declaration,

1:31:09.260 --> 1:31:11.860
 first, why is it called Great Barrington Declaration?

1:31:11.860 --> 1:31:13.300
 It's such a great name.

1:31:14.580 --> 1:31:16.820
 I mean, it's such an epic name,

1:31:16.820 --> 1:31:20.380
 but the reason why it's called that is way less than epic.

1:31:20.380 --> 1:31:23.900
 It was because the conference,

1:31:23.900 --> 1:31:25.540
 which is organized by Martin Kulldorff,

1:31:25.540 --> 1:31:27.780
 who was a professor at Harvard University,

1:31:27.780 --> 1:31:32.780
 by a statistician, he actually designed the safety system,

1:31:33.040 --> 1:31:36.340
 the statistical system that the FDA uses

1:31:36.340 --> 1:31:38.940
 for tracking vaccine safety.

1:31:38.940 --> 1:31:43.100
 He and I had met previously just the summer before,

1:31:43.100 --> 1:31:45.940
 that summer, and he invited me

1:31:45.940 --> 1:31:47.740
 to come to this small conference

1:31:47.740 --> 1:31:50.220
 where he was inviting me and Sunetra Gupta,

1:31:50.220 --> 1:31:53.380
 who is a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Harvard,

1:31:53.380 --> 1:31:54.900
 sorry, at Oxford University.

1:31:54.900 --> 1:31:57.980
 And I mean, I jumped at the chance

1:31:57.980 --> 1:32:00.980
 because I knew that Martin and Sunetra

1:32:00.980 --> 1:32:02.160
 were both smarter than me,

1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:04.380
 and it would be fun to talk about

1:32:04.380 --> 1:32:07.260
 what the right strategy would be.

1:32:07.260 --> 1:32:10.740
 On the drive in, I didn't know what the name of the town was

1:32:10.740 --> 1:32:13.540
 and I asked, they said it was Great Barrington,

1:32:13.540 --> 1:32:16.020
 and I had it in the back of my head.

1:32:16.020 --> 1:32:17.620
 Martin and I arrived a little early

1:32:17.620 --> 1:32:20.180
 and we were writing an op ed about some of the ideas,

1:32:20.180 --> 1:32:22.340
 I hope we'll get to talk about very soon,

1:32:22.340 --> 1:32:25.420
 about focused protection and the right strategy.

1:32:25.420 --> 1:32:27.260
 And when Sunetra arrived,

1:32:27.260 --> 1:32:30.140
 we realized we'd actually come basically to the same place

1:32:30.140 --> 1:32:32.980
 about the right way to deal with the epidemic.

1:32:34.340 --> 1:32:37.940
 And I thought, well, why don't we write something

1:32:37.940 --> 1:32:39.260
 like the Port Huron Statement,

1:32:39.260 --> 1:32:41.460
 is what I had in the back of my head.

1:32:41.460 --> 1:32:43.580
 And I'm like, well, what's the name of this town again?

1:32:43.580 --> 1:32:44.700
 It was Great Barrington.

1:32:44.700 --> 1:32:47.940
 Yeah, so it's not Barrington, it's Great Barrington.

1:32:47.940 --> 1:32:50.060
 Which is fantastic, right?

1:32:50.060 --> 1:32:53.060
 It's so over the top that it's perfect.

1:32:53.060 --> 1:32:55.740
 It's literally like the Big Bang.

1:32:55.740 --> 1:32:58.300
 There's something about these over the top fun titles

1:32:58.300 --> 1:33:01.140
 that just really delivered the power.

1:33:01.140 --> 1:33:03.740
 That's my main contribution was the title,

1:33:03.740 --> 1:33:05.820
 the name Great Barrington Decorate.

1:33:05.820 --> 1:33:07.340
 But yeah, so it was kind of a,

1:33:07.340 --> 1:33:12.060
 so the idea is actually, well, the title is great.

1:33:12.060 --> 1:33:14.820
 And I think that it was written in a very stylish way.

1:33:14.820 --> 1:33:18.740
 It's less than a page, you can go look online and read it.

1:33:18.740 --> 1:33:21.820
 It's written for, not for scientists,

1:33:21.820 --> 1:33:23.180
 but for the general public

1:33:23.180 --> 1:33:25.780
 so that people can understand the ideas really simply.

1:33:26.900 --> 1:33:29.500
 But it is not actually a radical set of ideas.

1:33:29.500 --> 1:33:32.820
 It actually represents the old pandemic plans

1:33:32.820 --> 1:33:35.180
 that we've used for a century

1:33:35.180 --> 1:33:37.260
 dealing with other similar pandemics.

1:33:38.740 --> 1:33:40.460
 And it's twofold.

1:33:41.420 --> 1:33:43.420
 First, let me talk about the science it rests on,

1:33:43.420 --> 1:33:45.100
 and then I'll talk about the plan.

1:33:45.100 --> 1:33:47.700
 The science actually, some of it we already talked about.

1:33:47.700 --> 1:33:49.620
 There's this massive age gradient

1:33:49.620 --> 1:33:51.980
 in the risk of COVID infection.

1:33:51.980 --> 1:33:54.620
 Older people face much higher risk than younger people.

1:33:55.740 --> 1:33:57.380
 The second bit of science is all,

1:33:57.380 --> 1:33:58.780
 that's not controversial, right?

1:33:58.780 --> 1:34:01.980
 Even if you think the IFR is 0.7 or 0.2,

1:34:01.980 --> 1:34:03.460
 no matter what, everyone thinks,

1:34:03.460 --> 1:34:05.460
 everyone agrees on this age gradient.

1:34:06.700 --> 1:34:09.860
 The second bit of science is also not controversial.

1:34:09.860 --> 1:34:13.380
 The lockdown focused policies that we've followed

1:34:13.380 --> 1:34:16.340
 have absolutely devastating consequences

1:34:16.340 --> 1:34:18.580
 on the health of the population.

1:34:20.100 --> 1:34:21.940
 Let me just give you some examples.

1:34:21.940 --> 1:34:24.660
 And this was known in October of 2020 when we wrote it.

1:34:24.660 --> 1:34:28.060
 So the UN was sounding alarms

1:34:28.060 --> 1:34:31.780
 that there would be tens of millions of people

1:34:31.780 --> 1:34:34.100
 who would starve as a consequence

1:34:34.100 --> 1:34:37.420
 of the economic dislocation caused by the lockdowns.

1:34:37.420 --> 1:34:38.700
 And that's come to pass.

1:34:38.700 --> 1:34:40.780
 Hundreds of thousands of children

1:34:40.780 --> 1:34:43.380
 in places like South Asia dead from starvation

1:34:43.380 --> 1:34:45.300
 as a consequence of lockdowns.

1:34:47.740 --> 1:34:52.740
 The priorities like the treatment of patients

1:34:53.620 --> 1:34:57.580
 with tuberculosis in poor countries stopped

1:34:57.580 --> 1:34:59.180
 because of lockdowns.

1:35:00.540 --> 1:35:04.340
 Childhood vaccinations of measles, mumps, rubella,

1:35:04.340 --> 1:35:07.940
 DPT, diphtheria, so on, pertussis, tetanus,

1:35:07.940 --> 1:35:11.940
 all those standard vaccination campaigns stopped.

1:35:11.940 --> 1:35:15.940
 Tens of millions of children skipping these doses

1:35:15.940 --> 1:35:18.860
 for diseases that are actually deadly for them.

1:35:19.820 --> 1:35:22.820
 Is there, just on a small tangent,

1:35:22.820 --> 1:35:26.100
 is it well understood to you what are the mechanisms

1:35:26.100 --> 1:35:28.540
 that stop all those things because of lockdowns?

1:35:28.540 --> 1:35:30.460
 Is it some aspect of supply chain?

1:35:30.460 --> 1:35:34.420
 Is it just literally because hospital doors are closed?

1:35:34.420 --> 1:35:37.900
 Is it because there's a disincentive to go outside

1:35:37.900 --> 1:35:40.380
 by people even when they deeply need help?

1:35:40.380 --> 1:35:42.180
 It's all of the above.

1:35:42.180 --> 1:35:43.860
 But a lot of those efforts,

1:35:43.860 --> 1:35:46.340
 especially those vaccination efforts are funded

1:35:46.340 --> 1:35:49.540
 and run by Western efforts.

1:35:49.540 --> 1:35:53.020
 Like Gavi is a, I think it's a Gates funded thing actually

1:35:53.020 --> 1:35:57.820
 that provides vaccines for millions of kids worldwide.

1:35:57.820 --> 1:36:00.860
 And those efforts were scaled back.

1:36:00.860 --> 1:36:02.500
 Malaria prevention efforts.

1:36:02.500 --> 1:36:04.380
 So in the developing world,

1:36:04.380 --> 1:36:07.820
 it was a devastating effect, these lockdowns.

1:36:07.820 --> 1:36:08.900
 There was also direct effects.

1:36:08.900 --> 1:36:13.060
 Like in India, the lockdowns, when they first instituted,

1:36:13.060 --> 1:36:16.940
 there was an order that 10 million migrant workers

1:36:16.940 --> 1:36:19.660
 who live in big cities and they live hand to mouth,

1:36:19.660 --> 1:36:23.420
 they buy coconuts, they sell the coconuts with the money,

1:36:23.420 --> 1:36:25.100
 they buy food for themselves and coconuts

1:36:25.100 --> 1:36:26.540
 for the next day to sell,

1:36:27.700 --> 1:36:29.180
 walk back to their villages

1:36:29.180 --> 1:36:33.180
 or go back to their villages overnight.

1:36:33.180 --> 1:36:35.500
 So 10 million people walking back to their villages

1:36:35.500 --> 1:36:39.100
 or taking a train back, 1,000 died on route.

1:36:39.100 --> 1:36:42.180
 Overcrowded trains dying essentially on the side of the road.

1:36:42.180 --> 1:36:44.700
 I mean, it was absolutely inhumane policy.

1:36:46.500 --> 1:36:48.820
 And the lockdowns there,

1:36:50.500 --> 1:36:53.140
 it's kind of like what's happened in the West as well,

1:36:53.140 --> 1:36:55.340
 but it was so severe.

1:36:55.340 --> 1:36:58.540
 There was a seroprevalence study done in Mumbai

1:36:58.540 --> 1:37:00.180
 by a friend of mine at the University of Chicago.

1:37:00.180 --> 1:37:03.500
 What he found was that in the slums of Mumbai,

1:37:03.500 --> 1:37:08.500
 there were 70% seroprevalence in July or August of 2020,

1:37:08.700 --> 1:37:12.300
 whereas in the rest of Mumbai, it was 20%, right?

1:37:12.300 --> 1:37:14.180
 So it was incredibly unequal.

1:37:14.180 --> 1:37:17.660
 The lockdowns protected the relatively well off

1:37:17.660 --> 1:37:20.700
 and spread the disease among the poor.

1:37:22.260 --> 1:37:25.500
 So that's in the developing world.

1:37:25.500 --> 1:37:27.900
 In the developed world, the health effects of lockdowns

1:37:27.900 --> 1:37:31.060
 were also quite bad, right?

1:37:31.060 --> 1:37:34.140
 So we've talked already about isolation and depression.

1:37:34.140 --> 1:37:37.660
 There was a study done in July of 2020

1:37:37.660 --> 1:37:41.180
 that found that one in four young adults

1:37:41.180 --> 1:37:43.420
 seriously considered suicide.

1:37:43.420 --> 1:37:47.940
 Now, suicide rates haven't spiked up so much,

1:37:47.940 --> 1:37:51.420
 but the depths of despair that would lead somebody

1:37:51.420 --> 1:37:53.420
 to seriously consider suicide itself

1:37:53.420 --> 1:37:57.820
 should be a source of great concern in public health.

1:37:57.820 --> 1:38:01.460
 Yeah, this is one of the troubling things about measuring

1:38:01.460 --> 1:38:06.220
 well being is we're okay at measuring death and suicide.

1:38:06.220 --> 1:38:08.980
 We're not so good at measuring suffering.

1:38:08.980 --> 1:38:13.980
 It's like people talk about maybe even Holodomor

1:38:14.940 --> 1:38:19.500
 under Stalin or the concentration camps with Hitler.

1:38:19.500 --> 1:38:23.940
 We talk about deaths, but we don't talk about the suffering

1:38:23.940 --> 1:38:27.740
 over periods of years by people living in fear,

1:38:27.740 --> 1:38:30.980
 by people starving, psychological trauma

1:38:30.980 --> 1:38:33.900
 that lasts a lifetime, all of those things.

1:38:33.900 --> 1:38:36.460
 I mean, and just to get back to that point,

1:38:36.460 --> 1:38:38.540
 we closed schools, especially in blue states,

1:38:38.540 --> 1:38:40.120
 we closed schools.

1:38:40.120 --> 1:38:42.300
 Now, richer parents could send their kids

1:38:42.300 --> 1:38:44.100
 to private schools, many of which stayed open

1:38:44.100 --> 1:38:45.060
 even in the blue states.

1:38:45.060 --> 1:38:47.060
 They could get pods, they could get tutors,

1:38:47.060 --> 1:38:50.580
 but that's not true for poor and middle class parents.

1:38:51.780 --> 1:38:54.540
 And as a result, what we did is we took away

1:38:54.540 --> 1:38:56.060
 life opportunities for kids.

1:38:56.060 --> 1:38:59.420
 We tried to teach five year olds to read via Zoom

1:38:59.420 --> 1:39:01.740
 in kindergarten, right?

1:39:02.780 --> 1:39:05.240
 And the consequence actually, you think, okay,

1:39:05.240 --> 1:39:07.260
 we can just make it up, but it's really difficult

1:39:07.260 --> 1:39:08.980
 to make that up.

1:39:08.980 --> 1:39:12.420
 There's a literature in health economics that shows

1:39:12.420 --> 1:39:17.420
 that even relatively small disruptions in schooling

1:39:18.620 --> 1:39:21.140
 can have lifelong consequences, negative consequences

1:39:21.140 --> 1:39:22.500
 for kids, right?

1:39:22.500 --> 1:39:27.340
 So they end up growing up poorer, they lead shorter lives

1:39:27.340 --> 1:39:30.180
 and less healthy lives as a consequence.

1:39:30.180 --> 1:39:32.740
 And that's what the literature now shows is likely to happen

1:39:32.740 --> 1:39:35.740
 with the interruptions of schooling that we had

1:39:35.740 --> 1:39:36.700
 in the United States.

1:39:36.700 --> 1:39:39.180
 Many European countries actually managed to avoid this.

1:39:39.180 --> 1:39:40.860
 There were in the early days of the epidemic

1:39:40.860 --> 1:39:43.660
 great indications that children first were not

1:39:43.660 --> 1:39:46.660
 very severely at risk from COVID itself,

1:39:46.660 --> 1:39:48.160
 nor are they super spreaders.

1:39:49.100 --> 1:39:51.620
 Schools were not the source of community spread,

1:39:51.620 --> 1:39:54.860
 communities spread the disease to schools,

1:39:54.860 --> 1:39:56.160
 not the other way around.

1:39:57.460 --> 1:39:59.300
 And we can talk about the scientific base of that

1:39:59.300 --> 1:40:01.720
 if you'd like, but that was pretty well known

1:40:01.720 --> 1:40:02.780
 even in October.

1:40:04.580 --> 1:40:06.700
 We closed hospitals in order to keep them

1:40:07.820 --> 1:40:10.980
 available to COVID patients, but as a result,

1:40:10.980 --> 1:40:14.140
 women skipped breast cancer screening.

1:40:14.140 --> 1:40:16.980
 As a result, they are showing up with late stage

1:40:16.980 --> 1:40:19.660
 breast cancer that should have been picked up last year.

1:40:19.660 --> 1:40:21.860
 Men and women skipped colon cancer screening,

1:40:21.860 --> 1:40:24.160
 again, with later stage disease that should have been

1:40:24.160 --> 1:40:26.180
 picked up last year with earlier stage.

1:40:26.180 --> 1:40:29.820
 For patients with diabetes, it's very important

1:40:29.820 --> 1:40:33.180
 to have regular screening for blood sugar levels

1:40:33.180 --> 1:40:36.740
 and sort of counseling for lifestyle improvement.

1:40:36.740 --> 1:40:38.140
 And we skipped that.

1:40:38.140 --> 1:40:39.700
 People stayed home with heart attacks

1:40:39.700 --> 1:40:41.520
 and died at home with heart attacks.

1:40:43.460 --> 1:40:47.380
 So you had this like sort of wide range of medical

1:40:47.380 --> 1:40:51.900
 and psychological harms that were being utterly ignored

1:40:51.900 --> 1:40:53.980
 as a result of the lockdowns.

1:40:53.980 --> 1:40:55.880
 Plus there's the economic pain.

1:40:57.240 --> 1:41:00.420
 So like you said, whatever is a good term

1:41:00.420 --> 1:41:05.040
 for the non laptop class, people would lose their jobs.

1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:07.700
 Yes, there might be in the Western world support

1:41:07.700 --> 1:41:11.440
 for them financially, but the big loss there

1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:14.960
 that is perhaps correlated with depression and suicide

1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:19.960
 is loss of meaning, loss of hope for the future,

1:41:19.980 --> 1:41:23.020
 loss of kind of a sense of stability,

1:41:23.020 --> 1:41:26.020
 all the pride you have in being able to make money

1:41:30.060 --> 1:41:32.820
 that allows you to pave your own way in the world.

1:41:32.820 --> 1:41:35.660
 And yes, just having less money than you're used to

1:41:35.660 --> 1:41:37.560
 so your family, your kids are suffering,

1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:38.400
 all those kinds of things.

1:41:38.400 --> 1:41:41.340
 And there's, again, an economics literature on this,

1:41:41.340 --> 1:41:43.660
 on deaths of despair it was called.

1:41:43.660 --> 1:41:45.900
 2009, there was the great recession.

1:41:45.900 --> 1:41:50.820
 It led to an enormous uptake in overdose from drugs,

1:41:50.820 --> 1:41:55.100
 suicidality, depression, as a result of the job losses

1:41:55.100 --> 1:41:57.580
 that happened during the great recession.

1:41:57.580 --> 1:41:59.140
 Well, that's happening again,

1:41:59.140 --> 1:42:02.700
 like an enormous increase in drug overdoses.

1:42:03.980 --> 1:42:07.900
 That's not an accident, that's a lockdown harm, right?

1:42:07.900 --> 1:42:10.460
 Same thing with the job losses.

1:42:10.460 --> 1:42:12.940
 The job losses, by the way, are like, it's so interesting

1:42:12.940 --> 1:42:15.620
 because the states that stayed open

1:42:15.620 --> 1:42:18.420
 have had much, much lower unemployment

1:42:18.420 --> 1:42:20.740
 than the states that stayed closed.

1:42:20.740 --> 1:42:23.500
 The labor force participation rates declined by 3%.

1:42:23.500 --> 1:42:25.440
 It's women that separated

1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:28.540
 because they stayed home with their kids.

1:42:28.540 --> 1:42:31.420
 We've reversed a generation of women,

1:42:33.380 --> 1:42:36.300
 improving women's participation in the labor force.

1:42:37.140 --> 1:42:41.140
 Do you think it has to do with the institutions

1:42:41.140 --> 1:42:44.500
 that we mentioned that there was so much priority given

1:42:44.500 --> 1:42:48.260
 or so much power given to maybe NIH

1:42:48.260 --> 1:42:51.700
 versus other civilian leaders?

1:42:51.700 --> 1:42:54.420
 Or do people just not care about the economic pain?

1:42:54.420 --> 1:42:59.380
 The leaders, I mean, because to me it was obvious.

1:42:59.380 --> 1:43:03.540
 I mean, probably it's just studying history.

1:43:03.540 --> 1:43:06.540
 Whenever I listen to people on Twitter

1:43:06.540 --> 1:43:09.820
 or on mainstream news or just anything,

1:43:09.820 --> 1:43:14.380
 I realize that's the very kind of top.

1:43:14.380 --> 1:43:17.220
 The people that have a voice

1:43:17.220 --> 1:43:19.620
 represent a tiny selection of people.

1:43:19.620 --> 1:43:21.740
 And so whenever there's hard times,

1:43:21.740 --> 1:43:26.740
 I always kind of think about the quiet, the voiceless,

1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:30.000
 the quiet suffering of the tens of millions,

1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:31.400
 of the hundreds of millions.

1:43:33.860 --> 1:43:36.380
 Do the political leaders not just give a damn?

1:43:36.380 --> 1:43:39.540
 I mean, I think it was actually a very odd ethical thing

1:43:39.540 --> 1:43:41.260
 at the beginning of the pandemic

1:43:41.260 --> 1:43:44.300
 where if you brought up economic harms at all,

1:43:44.300 --> 1:43:45.940
 you were seen as callous.

1:43:47.620 --> 1:43:50.040
 So I had a reporter call me up

1:43:50.040 --> 1:43:51.580
 almost at the very beginning of the epidemic

1:43:51.580 --> 1:43:56.580
 asking me about a very particular phenomenon.

1:43:56.900 --> 1:44:00.640
 So he was anticipating a rise in child abuse

1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:02.300
 because children were gonna be staying at home.

1:44:02.300 --> 1:44:04.980
 Child abuse is generally picked up at school.

1:44:04.980 --> 1:44:06.020
 And that actually happened.

1:44:06.020 --> 1:44:08.500
 So the reported child abuse dropped,

1:44:08.500 --> 1:44:10.260
 but actual child abuse increased

1:44:11.900 --> 1:44:14.100
 because normally you pick up the child abuse at school

1:44:14.100 --> 1:44:16.080
 and that you have the intervention, right?

1:44:16.080 --> 1:44:17.920
 So yeah, so I was talking about like,

1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:19.100
 well, there's gonna be some economic harms

1:44:19.100 --> 1:44:20.180
 and they're gonna have health consequences,

1:44:20.180 --> 1:44:21.740
 but the economic harms matter.

1:44:21.740 --> 1:44:24.540
 But he counseled me.

1:44:24.540 --> 1:44:27.460
 And I think he had my best interest at heart.

1:44:27.460 --> 1:44:29.500
 Like if you were to put that in the story,

1:44:29.500 --> 1:44:31.700
 I would be, I'd essentially be canceled.

1:44:31.700 --> 1:44:36.340
 Because what the narrative that arose in March of 2020

1:44:36.340 --> 1:44:39.700
 is if you care about money at all,

1:44:39.700 --> 1:44:43.700
 you're evil and crass, you must only care about lives.

1:44:43.700 --> 1:44:46.340
 The problem with that narrative is that that money,

1:44:46.340 --> 1:44:47.340
 which we're talking about,

1:44:47.340 --> 1:44:51.540
 is actually lives of poor people, right?

1:44:51.540 --> 1:44:54.660
 When you throw 100 million people around the world

1:44:54.660 --> 1:44:58.060
 into poverty, you're going to see enormous harm

1:44:58.060 --> 1:45:01.260
 to their health, enormous increases in their mortality.

1:45:01.260 --> 1:45:04.860
 It is not immoral to think about that and worry about that

1:45:04.860 --> 1:45:07.300
 in the context of this pandemic response.

1:45:07.300 --> 1:45:11.020
 Our mind focused so much on COVID that it forgot

1:45:11.020 --> 1:45:13.540
 that there are so many other public health priorities as well

1:45:13.540 --> 1:45:15.500
 that need our attention desperately.

1:45:16.420 --> 1:45:21.220
 And this is the thing I sensed about San Francisco

1:45:21.220 --> 1:45:24.620
 when I visited, I was thinking of moving there for a startup.

1:45:24.620 --> 1:45:26.580
 This is the thing I'm really afraid of,

1:45:26.580 --> 1:45:30.420
 especially if I have any effect on the world

1:45:30.420 --> 1:45:34.300
 through a startup, is losing touch in this kind of way.

1:45:34.300 --> 1:45:36.980
 That you mentioned the laptop class,

1:45:38.060 --> 1:45:40.260
 living in this world where you're only concerned

1:45:40.260 --> 1:45:44.380
 about this particular class of people.

1:45:44.380 --> 1:45:48.900
 And also, perhaps early on in the pandemic,

1:45:48.900 --> 1:45:50.060
 amongst the laptop class,

1:45:50.060 --> 1:45:51.920
 there was a legitimate concern for health,

1:45:51.920 --> 1:45:55.940
 like you're not sure how deadly this virus is.

1:45:55.940 --> 1:45:58.900
 You're not sure who to listen to, so there's a real concern.

1:45:58.900 --> 1:46:02.060
 And then at a certain point when the data starts coming in,

1:46:02.060 --> 1:46:05.140
 you start becoming more and more detached from the data.

1:46:05.140 --> 1:46:07.300
 You don't start caring less and less,

1:46:07.300 --> 1:46:10.740
 and you start just swimming in the space of narratives,

1:46:10.740 --> 1:46:12.420
 like existing in the space of narratives,

1:46:12.420 --> 1:46:15.420
 and you have this narrative in San Francisco

1:46:15.420 --> 1:46:19.660
 in the laptop class that you just are very proud

1:46:19.660 --> 1:46:21.180
 that you know the truth,

1:46:21.180 --> 1:46:22.940
 you're the sole possessors of the truth,

1:46:22.940 --> 1:46:25.140
 you congratulate yourself on it,

1:46:25.140 --> 1:46:28.940
 and you don't care what actually gigantic detrimental effect

1:46:28.940 --> 1:46:33.120
 that has on society, because you're mostly fine.

1:46:34.460 --> 1:46:36.840
 I'm so terrified of that.

1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:38.500
 Well, actually, I think the antidote to that

1:46:38.500 --> 1:46:39.760
 is just to remember.

1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:40.600
 You remember.

1:46:40.600 --> 1:46:41.920
 Yeah. Yeah.

1:46:41.920 --> 1:46:44.020
 I don't think, you know, remember where you came from

1:46:44.020 --> 1:46:46.380
 and remember who you're doing this for.

1:46:46.380 --> 1:46:48.000
 At the back of your head should always be,

1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:49.520
 what's the purpose?

1:46:49.520 --> 1:46:50.780
 Like, why am I here?

1:46:50.780 --> 1:46:51.740
 What's the purpose of this?

1:46:51.740 --> 1:46:56.540
 And if the purpose is simply self aggrandizement,

1:46:56.540 --> 1:46:57.660
 then you should rethink,

1:46:57.660 --> 1:46:59.960
 because it'll just end up being a hollow life.

1:47:01.180 --> 1:47:03.180
 All of us will be forgotten in the end.

1:47:04.860 --> 1:47:08.580
 Focused protection, the idea, the policy,

1:47:08.580 --> 1:47:09.980
 what is focused protection?

1:47:09.980 --> 1:47:12.900
 Right, so I was saying that there's two scientific bases,

1:47:12.900 --> 1:47:15.140
 right, so one is this steep age gradient,

1:47:15.140 --> 1:47:17.100
 and the second is the existence of locked arms.

1:47:17.100 --> 1:47:19.260
 Again, I think there's very little disagreement

1:47:19.260 --> 1:47:22.360
 in the scientific community on both of those facts.

1:47:22.360 --> 1:47:24.540
 If you put those facts together,

1:47:24.540 --> 1:47:27.780
 the obvious policy is to protect the people

1:47:27.780 --> 1:47:31.620
 who are at the most severe risk from the disease itself.

1:47:31.620 --> 1:47:33.100
 And that's the idea of focused protection.

1:47:33.100 --> 1:47:35.180
 That's the general principle of it.

1:47:35.180 --> 1:47:37.420
 The actual implementation of it

1:47:37.420 --> 1:47:39.800
 depends on the living circumstances

1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:41.700
 of the people that are at risk,

1:47:41.700 --> 1:47:44.100
 the resources that are available in the community,

1:47:44.100 --> 1:47:47.800
 the technology that's available to do this.

1:47:49.380 --> 1:47:51.900
 And so it's almost always going to be,

1:47:51.900 --> 1:47:54.900
 in fact, it'll always be a local thing,

1:47:54.900 --> 1:47:58.340
 because it'll depend on all of those things

1:47:58.340 --> 1:48:00.340
 which are all local in nature.

1:48:00.340 --> 1:48:02.900
 Right, so one very, very obvious thing,

1:48:02.900 --> 1:48:04.820
 in a country like ours,

1:48:04.820 --> 1:48:08.140
 where so many older people live in institutionalized settings

1:48:08.140 --> 1:48:09.380
 and nursing home settings,

1:48:10.540 --> 1:48:13.100
 and that's where older, really vulnerable,

1:48:13.100 --> 1:48:14.900
 chronically ill patients often live,

1:48:16.340 --> 1:48:18.340
 and you know this disease affects that group,

1:48:18.340 --> 1:48:21.260
 most commonly, it is absolutely vital

1:48:21.260 --> 1:48:22.540
 to protect that group.

1:48:23.620 --> 1:48:26.780
 We should have known that in February 2020,

1:48:26.780 --> 1:48:28.140
 just from the Chinese data.

1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:33.220
 And we should have thought about that group

1:48:33.220 --> 1:48:37.720
 as the key constraint in our policymaking.

1:48:38.940 --> 1:48:41.780
 Instead, we thought about, in February and March 2020,

1:48:41.780 --> 1:48:44.900
 as hospital beds as the key constraint.

1:48:44.900 --> 1:48:46.940
 Hospital beds and ventilator shortages,

1:48:46.940 --> 1:48:49.900
 and so we ran around trying to address

1:48:49.900 --> 1:48:53.500
 that constraint, like a linear programming problem,

1:48:53.500 --> 1:48:55.340
 you figure out which constraint's binding

1:48:55.340 --> 1:48:56.500
 and you address that one thing

1:48:56.500 --> 1:48:58.800
 and then you go on to the next one, right?

1:48:58.800 --> 1:49:00.700
 If that one constraint,

1:49:00.700 --> 1:49:03.100
 we said, okay, the constraint is hospital beds.

1:49:04.260 --> 1:49:08.300
 That led to the decision in many of the Northeast states

1:49:08.300 --> 1:49:12.420
 to send COVID infected patients who were on the verge

1:49:12.420 --> 1:49:14.420
 or looked like they were about to recover

1:49:14.420 --> 1:49:15.900
 back to nursing homes,

1:49:17.300 --> 1:49:19.260
 who then spread the disease all through there,

1:49:19.260 --> 1:49:21.820
 because they wanted to preserve the hospital beds.

1:49:21.820 --> 1:49:25.260
 Well, for somebody who loves numerical optimization,

1:49:25.260 --> 1:49:26.700
 I love the way you frame this.

1:49:27.980 --> 1:49:30.380
 But those are kind of connected, right?

1:49:30.380 --> 1:49:33.780
 If you actually focus on protecting the vulnerable,

1:49:33.780 --> 1:49:36.500
 you will also have the effect

1:49:36.500 --> 1:49:40.820
 of not hitting the ceiling of the available hospital beds.

1:49:40.820 --> 1:49:41.660
 That's the irony.

1:49:41.660 --> 1:49:44.180
 If we protected the vulnerable,

1:49:44.180 --> 1:49:47.140
 the vulnerable are the most likely to be hospitalized,

1:49:47.140 --> 1:49:48.700
 and so by protecting the hospital,

1:49:48.700 --> 1:49:49.900
 by protecting the vulnerable,

1:49:49.900 --> 1:49:53.080
 we will also have addressed the shortage of hospital beds

1:49:53.080 --> 1:49:53.920
 more effectively.

1:49:53.920 --> 1:49:55.620
 So that little shift in priority

1:49:55.620 --> 1:49:57.740
 would have had a big impact.

1:49:57.740 --> 1:50:01.740
 Okay, but specifically, the idea is to,

1:50:01.740 --> 1:50:03.700
 and we could talk about different ideas

1:50:03.700 --> 1:50:04.660
 of how to actually do this,

1:50:04.660 --> 1:50:09.660
 but you basically do a lockdown or something like that

1:50:10.100 --> 1:50:12.260
 on a very small set of people.

1:50:12.260 --> 1:50:13.300
 You may have to do that

1:50:13.300 --> 1:50:14.900
 if community spread is very high,

1:50:14.900 --> 1:50:18.540
 but generally, I think it would depend on, again,

1:50:18.540 --> 1:50:20.460
 the living circumstances and the,

1:50:20.460 --> 1:50:23.340
 so for instance, if you are in a,

1:50:23.340 --> 1:50:25.440
 if you have a, here's a very simple idea

1:50:25.440 --> 1:50:28.260
 that doesn't require a lockdown forced on them.

1:50:28.260 --> 1:50:29.340
 I don't actually generally,

1:50:29.340 --> 1:50:31.100
 I'm not in favor of that kind of forced lockdown

1:50:31.100 --> 1:50:33.060
 because you just won't get cooperation.

1:50:33.980 --> 1:50:36.300
 But what you could do is provide resources

1:50:36.300 --> 1:50:38.040
 to that group of people.

1:50:38.040 --> 1:50:42.460
 So imagine you live next door to somebody, an older couple,

1:50:43.740 --> 1:50:46.300
 and there's high community spread.

1:50:46.300 --> 1:50:48.940
 Well, they have to go grocery shopping.

1:50:48.940 --> 1:50:50.940
 We did like, some communities did these

1:50:50.940 --> 1:50:53.780
 like senior only grocery hour, right?

1:50:53.780 --> 1:50:55.100
 But they have to still have to go out

1:50:55.100 --> 1:50:56.780
 and they might get exposed

1:50:56.780 --> 1:50:59.640
 when they're shopping amongst other seniors.

1:50:59.640 --> 1:51:03.400
 Well, why not organized home delivery of groceries to them?

1:51:03.400 --> 1:51:06.380
 We did that for the laptop class, right?

1:51:06.380 --> 1:51:09.060
 Or you can even just use a volunteer effort.

1:51:09.060 --> 1:51:10.220
 The older people living next door,

1:51:10.220 --> 1:51:11.060
 just call them up and say,

1:51:11.060 --> 1:51:13.580
 can I help you go out and go shopping for you?

1:51:13.580 --> 1:51:16.500
 And so you would have potentially federal support

1:51:16.500 --> 1:51:17.340
 of that kind of thing.

1:51:17.340 --> 1:51:19.500
 So these kinds of efforts.

1:51:19.500 --> 1:51:22.100
 Identify where the vulnerable people live.

1:51:22.100 --> 1:51:24.580
 It's really challenging in multigenerational homes.

1:51:24.580 --> 1:51:25.580
 In LA County, for instance,

1:51:25.580 --> 1:51:28.780
 there's a lot of older people living together

1:51:28.780 --> 1:51:31.460
 with younger people in relatively crowded,

1:51:31.460 --> 1:51:34.120
 there it's really quite a challenge.

1:51:34.120 --> 1:51:35.780
 But there again, you can use resources.

1:51:35.780 --> 1:51:40.780
 So if grandma is worried that grandson has come home,

1:51:40.780 --> 1:51:42.000
 but is potentially been exposed,

1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:43.660
 grandson calls grandma says, I mean,

1:51:43.660 --> 1:51:47.140
 I might've been at a party where COVID was.

1:51:47.140 --> 1:51:49.140
 Grandma calls public health, public health,

1:51:49.140 --> 1:51:50.700
 and says, okay, you can have this hotel room

1:51:50.700 --> 1:51:54.340
 for a couple of days until you check to turn negative.

1:51:54.340 --> 1:51:56.060
 In case it wasn't clear,

1:51:56.060 --> 1:51:58.620
 the idea of focused protection

1:51:58.620 --> 1:52:03.100
 is the people that are vulnerable, protect them.

1:52:03.100 --> 1:52:06.180
 And everybody else goes on with their lives,

1:52:06.180 --> 1:52:09.780
 open up the economy, just do as it was before.

1:52:09.780 --> 1:52:10.960
 There was still fear abroad.

1:52:10.960 --> 1:52:12.900
 So there still would be some restrictions

1:52:12.900 --> 1:52:14.100
 that people would pose on themselves.

1:52:14.100 --> 1:52:15.760
 They probably would go to parties less.

1:52:15.760 --> 1:52:19.360
 The grandsons probably wouldn't go so many parties, right?

1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:23.500
 There would be less participation in big gatherings.

1:52:23.500 --> 1:52:25.140
 And you may even say like big gatherings

1:52:25.140 --> 1:52:27.500
 in order to restrict community spread again.

1:52:27.500 --> 1:52:29.380
 I'm not against any of that,

1:52:29.380 --> 1:52:31.820
 but you shouldn't be closing businesses.

1:52:31.820 --> 1:52:34.020
 You shouldn't be closing churches and synagogues.

1:52:34.020 --> 1:52:38.560
 You shouldn't be forcing people to not go to school.

1:52:38.560 --> 1:52:41.340
 You should not be shuttering businesses.

1:52:41.340 --> 1:52:44.060
 You should just allow society to go on.

1:52:44.060 --> 1:52:46.900
 Some disease will spread, but as we've seen,

1:52:46.900 --> 1:52:50.100
 the lockdown didn't stop the disease from spreading anyways.

1:52:50.100 --> 1:52:50.940
 Right.

1:52:50.940 --> 1:52:54.100
 So what do you make of the criticism that this idea,

1:52:54.100 --> 1:52:59.100
 like all good ideas cannot actually be implemented

1:52:59.740 --> 1:53:01.300
 in a heterogeneous society

1:53:01.300 --> 1:53:03.660
 where there's a lot of people intermixing?

1:53:03.660 --> 1:53:06.400
 And once you open it up,

1:53:06.400 --> 1:53:09.380
 people like the younger people will just forget

1:53:09.380 --> 1:53:11.140
 that this is even existing.

1:53:11.140 --> 1:53:13.060
 And they'll stop caring about the older people

1:53:13.060 --> 1:53:14.300
 and mess up the whole thing.

1:53:14.300 --> 1:53:16.820
 And the government will not want to fund

1:53:16.820 --> 1:53:18.900
 any kind of the great efforts you're talking about

1:53:18.900 --> 1:53:21.980
 about food delivery and then the food delivery services

1:53:21.980 --> 1:53:24.460
 be like, why the heck am I helping out on this anyway?

1:53:24.460 --> 1:53:26.740
 Because like, it's not making me much money.

1:53:26.740 --> 1:53:30.560
 And so therefore like all good ideas, it will collapse.

1:53:30.560 --> 1:53:31.400
 That might be true.

1:53:31.400 --> 1:53:34.000
 I mean, I think it's always a risk with policy thing,

1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:37.180
 but I think if you think back to the moment,

1:53:37.180 --> 1:53:39.060
 but we actually felt like we were in this together

1:53:39.060 --> 1:53:39.900
 to some extent.

1:53:39.900 --> 1:53:40.800
 Yes.

1:53:40.800 --> 1:53:44.460
 Right, I think that that empathy that we had

1:53:44.460 --> 1:53:48.820
 that was used to like tell people to stay in

1:53:48.820 --> 1:53:51.260
 and like happily, not go in happily,

1:53:51.260 --> 1:53:55.000
 but like stay in to like wear a mask

1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:57.100
 or to do all these things that we thought

1:53:57.100 --> 1:53:59.820
 would help other people could have been redirected

1:53:59.820 --> 1:54:02.860
 to actually helping the people who most needed to be helped.

1:54:02.860 --> 1:54:06.960
 Especially, I do remember March.

1:54:08.120 --> 1:54:10.460
 So this is even way before Barrington,

1:54:10.460 --> 1:54:11.740
 all that kind of stuff.

1:54:12.580 --> 1:54:16.100
 March, April, May, there was a feeling like

1:54:16.100 --> 1:54:20.860
 if we all just work together, we'll solve this.

1:54:20.860 --> 1:54:24.380
 And that maybe started to, when did that start breaking down?

1:54:24.380 --> 1:54:28.740
 I mean, unfortunately the election is mixed into this.

1:54:28.740 --> 1:54:30.900
 That it became politicized.

1:54:30.900 --> 1:54:32.860
 But I think it lasted quite a long time.

1:54:32.860 --> 1:54:33.880
 I think into the summer,

1:54:33.880 --> 1:54:36.740
 I think there was some of that sense.

1:54:36.740 --> 1:54:39.820
 I don't know, it obviously varied among different people.

1:54:39.820 --> 1:54:42.380
 But I think that it's true it would have been challenging.

1:54:42.380 --> 1:54:44.860
 It's also true that it's heterogeneous,

1:54:44.860 --> 1:54:46.820
 exactly the way you said.

1:54:46.820 --> 1:54:49.860
 But what that means is you need a local response,

1:54:49.860 --> 1:54:53.460
 a response, so like my vision of a public health officer

1:54:53.460 --> 1:54:56.460
 is someone that understands their community,

1:54:56.460 --> 1:54:59.200
 not necessarily the nation at large, but their community,

1:54:59.200 --> 1:55:01.420
 and then works within their community

1:55:01.420 --> 1:55:03.300
 to figure out how to deploy the resources

1:55:03.300 --> 1:55:04.500
 that they have available

1:55:05.580 --> 1:55:08.140
 to do the kind of protection policies we're talking about.

1:55:08.140 --> 1:55:10.020
 That's what should have happened.

1:55:10.020 --> 1:55:12.740
 Instead, they spent a huge amount of efforts

1:55:12.740 --> 1:55:15.540
 closing, making sure businesses stayed closed.

1:55:15.540 --> 1:55:17.220
 Businesses that, I mean,

1:55:17.220 --> 1:55:20.680
 they're like hardware stores that closed.

1:55:20.680 --> 1:55:22.820
 What good did closing a hardware store do

1:55:23.780 --> 1:55:24.980
 for the spread of COVID?

1:55:24.980 --> 1:55:26.900
 If it had an effect on COVID spread,

1:55:26.900 --> 1:55:28.020
 I mean, it's gonna be March.

1:55:28.020 --> 1:55:30.020
 Checking to make sure that plexiglass

1:55:30.020 --> 1:55:31.100
 was put up everywhere,

1:55:31.100 --> 1:55:32.460
 which now in retrospect turns out

1:55:32.460 --> 1:55:34.840
 to have probably made the disease worse.

1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:40.340
 Masking enforcement, so shaming around masks,

1:55:40.340 --> 1:55:42.500
 I mean, a huge amount of effort on things

1:55:42.500 --> 1:55:47.000
 that were only tangentially related to focus protection.

1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:49.140
 What if we turned our energy,

1:55:49.140 --> 1:55:52.260
 that enormous energy put into that,

1:55:52.260 --> 1:55:54.460
 instead into focus protection of the vulnerable?

1:55:54.460 --> 1:55:57.100
 That's essentially the conversation I was calling for.

1:55:57.100 --> 1:55:59.380
 And it wasn't, I mean, I didn't think of it

1:55:59.380 --> 1:56:01.020
 as we had every single idea.

1:56:01.020 --> 1:56:03.580
 I mean, we gave some concrete proposals,

1:56:03.580 --> 1:56:05.140
 but the criticism we got was that

1:56:05.140 --> 1:56:07.140
 those concrete proposals weren't enough.

1:56:08.180 --> 1:56:10.220
 And the answer to that is that's true.

1:56:10.220 --> 1:56:11.060
 They weren't enough.

1:56:11.060 --> 1:56:12.660
 I wasn't thinking of them as enough.

1:56:12.660 --> 1:56:15.300
 I was thinking that I wanted to involve

1:56:15.300 --> 1:56:17.980
 an enormous number of people in local public health

1:56:17.980 --> 1:56:20.900
 to help think about how to do focus protection

1:56:20.900 --> 1:56:22.180
 in their communities.

1:56:22.180 --> 1:56:27.180
 The question that's interesting here is about the future too.

1:56:29.260 --> 1:56:32.740
 So COVID has very specific characteristics,

1:56:32.740 --> 1:56:36.180
 like you mentioned, about the curve of the death rate

1:56:36.180 --> 1:56:39.580
 based on the, like it seems like with COVID,

1:56:39.580 --> 1:56:42.140
 it's a little bit easier to actually identify

1:56:42.140 --> 1:56:45.660
 a group of people that you need to protect.

1:56:45.660 --> 1:56:47.940
 So other viruses may not be this way.

1:56:47.940 --> 1:56:52.940
 So might lockdown be a good idea, like hardcore lockdown

1:56:53.420 --> 1:56:57.660
 for a future virus that's 10 times deadlier,

1:56:57.660 --> 1:56:59.780
 but spreads at the same rate as COVID?

1:56:59.780 --> 1:57:02.860
 Or maybe another way to ask that is imagine a virus

1:57:02.860 --> 1:57:06.260
 that's 10 times deadlier, what's the right response?

1:57:06.260 --> 1:57:08.780
 I mean, I think it's always gonna be focus protection,

1:57:08.780 --> 1:57:12.140
 but the group that needs the focus protection may change

1:57:12.140 --> 1:57:14.380
 depending on the biology of the virus, right?

1:57:14.380 --> 1:57:18.580
 So the polio epidemic in the 40s and 50s in the US,

1:57:18.580 --> 1:57:22.040
 the great, the people at most risk were children.

1:57:23.220 --> 1:57:24.980
 We didn't know really at the beginning

1:57:24.980 --> 1:57:27.020
 there was this fecal oral spread.

1:57:27.020 --> 1:57:29.220
 And so we did all kinds of crazy things,

1:57:30.340 --> 1:57:33.580
 including like spraying DDT in communities,

1:57:33.580 --> 1:57:37.020
 which somehow was supposed to get rid of polio.

1:57:37.020 --> 1:57:40.020
 But the focus was on whenever there was an outbreak,

1:57:40.020 --> 1:57:42.060
 they would close the school down.

1:57:42.060 --> 1:57:43.700
 And that was the right thing to do

1:57:43.700 --> 1:57:48.700
 because that group that needed protection was children.

1:57:48.720 --> 1:57:51.980
 And the disease was spread, we thought in schools.

1:57:53.620 --> 1:57:56.660
 I don't think there's a single formula that works,

1:57:56.660 --> 1:57:59.380
 but there's a single principle that works, right?

1:57:59.380 --> 1:58:02.260
 No matter, it's hard to imagine a disease

1:58:02.260 --> 1:58:05.420
 that's uniformly deadly across every group

1:58:05.420 --> 1:58:07.220
 in every single person.

1:58:07.220 --> 1:58:09.700
 There's always gonna be some group

1:58:09.700 --> 1:58:13.700
 that's differentially harmed.

1:58:13.700 --> 1:58:14.840
 There's always gonna be some group

1:58:14.840 --> 1:58:16.260
 that's differentially protected.

1:58:16.260 --> 1:58:17.980
 And that may change over time, right?

1:58:17.980 --> 1:58:22.980
 So like in this disease, in this epidemic,

1:58:23.420 --> 1:58:25.840
 as people got infected and recovered,

1:58:25.840 --> 1:58:27.180
 we now had a class of people

1:58:27.180 --> 1:58:29.700
 that were pretty well protected against the disease.

1:58:30.900 --> 1:58:34.360
 They should be, like instead of ostracizing them

1:58:34.360 --> 1:58:36.020
 because they don't want a vaccine,

1:58:36.020 --> 1:58:37.780
 we should be allowing them to work.

1:58:37.780 --> 1:58:41.300
 I mean, we're having staffing shortages in hospitals now

1:58:41.300 --> 1:58:43.320
 because we forgot that principle.

1:58:43.320 --> 1:58:46.580
 Is quite a bit of this a technology problem?

1:58:46.580 --> 1:58:47.620
 So being able to,

1:58:49.700 --> 1:58:52.540
 how much of it is a sociological problem?

1:58:53.940 --> 1:58:56.380
 How much of it is a technology problem?

1:58:56.380 --> 1:58:59.100
 Like where do you put the blame

1:58:59.100 --> 1:59:01.420
 sort of on why this didn't go so great

1:59:01.420 --> 1:59:04.160
 and how it can go great in the beginning?

1:59:04.160 --> 1:59:05.420
 I mean, think about lockdowns.

1:59:05.420 --> 1:59:06.980
 Like if we didn't have Zoom,

1:59:06.980 --> 1:59:08.620
 we wouldn't have lockdowns.

1:59:08.620 --> 1:59:11.580
 There's a reason in 2009 we didn't lock down.

1:59:11.580 --> 1:59:13.740
 I mean, we didn't have the technology to replace work

1:59:13.740 --> 1:59:17.020
 with this remote technology.

1:59:17.900 --> 1:59:21.340
 So we had good lockdown technology in Zoom.

1:59:21.340 --> 1:59:25.320
 We didn't have good focus protection technology.

1:59:25.320 --> 1:59:26.260
 Yeah, I mean, focus protection

1:59:26.260 --> 1:59:27.340
 is always gonna be complicated,

1:59:27.340 --> 1:59:29.500
 especially for something like this that spreads so easily,

1:59:29.500 --> 1:59:30.980
 it's gonna be complicated.

1:59:30.980 --> 1:59:34.980
 And I'm the last person to say it would have been perfect.

1:59:34.980 --> 1:59:37.740
 There would have been people that would have gotten sick,

1:59:37.740 --> 1:59:39.040
 but they got sick anyways.

1:59:39.040 --> 1:59:41.500
 The hope was that if we suppress community spread

1:59:41.500 --> 1:59:44.540
 low enough, we can protect the vulnerable.

1:59:44.540 --> 1:59:47.180
 That was the hope by lockdown.

1:59:47.180 --> 1:59:50.380
 The reality was that only a certain class of people

1:59:50.380 --> 1:59:51.820
 were able to benefit from lockdown.

1:59:51.820 --> 1:59:53.820
 The rest of society, we call them essential workers,

1:59:53.820 --> 1:59:55.700
 had to keep working and they got sick.

1:59:56.660 --> 1:59:58.180
 And the disease kept spreading.

1:59:58.180 --> 2:00:00.280
 It didn't actually have a substantial effect

2:00:00.280 --> 2:00:05.280
 on community spread in non laptop class populations.

2:00:05.980 --> 2:00:08.380
 And also we should probably expand the class of people

2:00:08.380 --> 2:00:12.220
 we call vulnerable to those who would suffer,

2:00:12.220 --> 2:00:14.440
 who have the capacity to suffer,

2:00:15.700 --> 2:00:19.060
 given the policies you're weighing.

2:00:19.060 --> 2:00:22.700
 It's very disingenuous to call the vulnerable

2:00:22.700 --> 2:00:26.180
 just the people, obviously we had the very specific meaning,

2:00:26.180 --> 2:00:31.180
 but broadly speaking, vulnerable should include anybody

2:00:31.740 --> 2:00:34.780
 who can suffer based on the policies you take

2:00:34.780 --> 2:00:36.980
 in response to a virus.

2:00:36.980 --> 2:00:39.100
 That principle you just said is completely agree with

2:00:39.100 --> 2:00:41.580
 is something I think has been lost.

2:00:42.820 --> 2:00:44.260
 And unfortunately lost, right?

2:00:44.260 --> 2:00:49.260
 So the policies themselves, if they have harm,

2:00:49.380 --> 2:00:53.460
 those are real and we shouldn't pretend like they're not.

2:00:53.460 --> 2:00:57.380
 And essentially demonize the people that suffer them.

2:00:58.180 --> 2:01:01.500
 Or pretend, I mean like a lot of times like the depression

2:01:01.500 --> 2:01:02.720
 that we've been talking about,

2:01:02.720 --> 2:01:06.020
 that's thought of as like not so important,

2:01:06.020 --> 2:01:07.020
 but it is important.

2:01:08.380 --> 2:01:12.460
 And especially the harm to the people in poor countries,

2:01:12.460 --> 2:01:14.820
 it's like been out of sight, out of mind

2:01:14.820 --> 2:01:16.900
 in much of the rich parts of the world.

2:01:16.900 --> 2:01:20.140
 Once again, I've hoped that we seeing this,

2:01:20.140 --> 2:01:22.980
 learning lessons of history with the communication tools

2:01:22.980 --> 2:01:24.260
 who have now will learn this.

2:01:24.260 --> 2:01:26.180
 It's like going to another country

2:01:26.180 --> 2:01:29.380
 and bombing targeted terrorist locations,

2:01:29.380 --> 2:01:32.100
 and there's going to be some civilians who die,

2:01:32.100 --> 2:01:37.100
 pretending that the child who watches their dad die

2:01:37.740 --> 2:01:40.620
 is not going to grow up, first of all, traumatized,

2:01:40.620 --> 2:01:43.700
 but second of all, potentially bring more hate to the world

2:01:43.700 --> 2:01:46.860
 than the hate that you were allegedly fighting

2:01:46.860 --> 2:01:47.700
 in the first place.

2:01:47.700 --> 2:01:52.580
 That's another sort of considering only one kind of harm

2:01:52.580 --> 2:01:54.100
 and not the full range of harms

2:01:54.100 --> 2:01:55.780
 that are being caused by your policies.

2:01:55.780 --> 2:01:59.180
 You know, like the good return to focus protection,

2:01:59.180 --> 2:02:01.700
 we still should be following the policy now for COVID

2:02:01.700 --> 2:02:03.060
 and we're not, right?

2:02:03.060 --> 2:02:06.860
 So the vaccines, there's a great shortage of vaccines.

2:02:06.860 --> 2:02:08.480
 You wouldn't know it in the United States

2:02:08.480 --> 2:02:09.820
 and the rich parts of the world,

2:02:09.820 --> 2:02:11.660
 but there's a great shortage of vaccines.

2:02:11.660 --> 2:02:15.280
 We're not going to be able to vaccinate the most of the,

2:02:15.280 --> 2:02:17.140
 like the entire set of elderly at least,

2:02:17.140 --> 2:02:20.980
 and or larger groups until late 2022.

2:02:20.980 --> 2:02:24.140
 Huge numbers of older people around the world

2:02:24.140 --> 2:02:27.480
 in poor countries that have not COVID recovered yet,

2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:30.940
 so they're still quite vulnerable, have not had the vaccine.

2:02:30.940 --> 2:02:33.500
 And yet we're talking about vaccinating five year olds

2:02:34.500 --> 2:02:37.620
 who benefit, if at all, from the vaccines

2:02:37.620 --> 2:02:38.600
 of just a very little bit

2:02:38.600 --> 2:02:41.100
 because they face such a low risk of harm from COVID.

2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:45.940
 Well, something that's a little bit near and dear

2:02:45.940 --> 2:02:49.280
 to our specific, the two of our hearts.

2:02:49.280 --> 2:02:51.300
 So you're at Stanford.

2:02:51.300 --> 2:02:53.700
 So Stanford recently announced

2:02:53.700 --> 2:02:55.660
 that they're going back to virtual,

2:02:55.660 --> 2:02:59.300
 at least for some period of time in response to the,

2:02:59.300 --> 2:03:01.340
 maybe you can clarify, but I think it's in response

2:03:01.340 --> 2:03:05.380
 to the escalated, how would they phrase it?

2:03:05.380 --> 2:03:06.780
 It's related to Omicron.

2:03:07.860 --> 2:03:12.140
 And a few other universities are kind of like

2:03:12.140 --> 2:03:13.660
 considering back and forth.

2:03:13.660 --> 2:03:16.580
 In my perspective, as somebody who loves

2:03:16.580 --> 2:03:21.580
 in person lectures, who sees the value of that

2:03:23.140 --> 2:03:28.140
 to students, to young minds, also looking at the data,

2:03:28.460 --> 2:03:33.460
 seems the risk aversion in university policies

2:03:36.140 --> 2:03:40.900
 around this, given how healthy the student population is,

2:03:40.900 --> 2:03:44.020
 seems not well calibrated.

2:03:44.020 --> 2:03:44.860
 Let's put it this way.

2:03:44.860 --> 2:03:48.100
 Also, pathological is one way to put it.

2:03:48.100 --> 2:03:50.660
 Given that, I believe, depending on the university,

2:03:50.660 --> 2:03:53.140
 but I think many universities require

2:03:53.140 --> 2:03:57.020
 that the student body is vaccinated at this point.

2:03:57.020 --> 2:04:01.060
 So I think it's a big mistake by Stanford to do this.

2:04:01.060 --> 2:04:05.820
 And I'd like to say that because I just hope MIT doesn't.

2:04:07.380 --> 2:04:09.020
 But what are your thoughts about Stanford?

2:04:09.020 --> 2:04:10.140
 Is there a student?

2:04:10.140 --> 2:04:11.340
 I completely agree with you.

2:04:11.340 --> 2:04:14.980
 I think we have failed in our mission

2:04:14.980 --> 2:04:18.860
 to educate our students by this decision.

2:04:18.860 --> 2:04:20.900
 And I think, frankly, just more broadly,

2:04:20.900 --> 2:04:22.980
 I think we failed generally over the course

2:04:22.980 --> 2:04:24.880
 of the last year and a half in living up

2:04:24.880 --> 2:04:26.180
 to our educational mission.

2:04:27.620 --> 2:04:30.980
 In person teaching is vital.

2:04:31.980 --> 2:04:35.300
 Now, I can understand, if you have older faculty,

2:04:35.300 --> 2:04:37.180
 the principle of focus protection says,

2:04:37.180 --> 2:04:40.260
 provide some alternative teaching arrangements for them.

2:04:40.260 --> 2:04:41.380
 That makes sense to me.

2:04:42.580 --> 2:04:44.300
 From the kid's point of view,

2:04:44.300 --> 2:04:46.940
 they're more harmed by not getting the education

2:04:46.940 --> 2:04:50.260
 we promised them than by COVID.

2:04:51.420 --> 2:04:54.740
 So applying this principle of this focus protection,

2:04:54.740 --> 2:04:58.020
 let young professors teach in person.

2:04:58.020 --> 2:04:59.140
 This is before the vaccine.

2:04:59.140 --> 2:05:01.260
 After the vaccine, let everyone teach in person.

2:05:01.260 --> 2:05:02.220
 Yeah, this is the part,

2:05:02.220 --> 2:05:04.580
 I don't understand the discussion we're even having

2:05:04.580 --> 2:05:09.580
 because, okay, let's leave focus protection aside here

2:05:09.580 --> 2:05:12.480
 because that's a brilliant policy for,

2:05:12.480 --> 2:05:15.800
 perhaps for the future when there's no vaccine.

2:05:15.800 --> 2:05:20.160
 Now with the vaccine, I'm misunderstanding something here

2:05:20.160 --> 2:05:24.940
 because we're now in a space that's psychological.

2:05:24.940 --> 2:05:27.700
 It's no longer about biology

2:05:27.700 --> 2:05:30.560
 because with the booster shots,

2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:34.880
 which I believe MIT is now requiring before January,

2:05:34.880 --> 2:05:37.180
 with the booster shots, the data shows,

2:05:37.180 --> 2:05:41.760
 no matter how old you are, the risks are very low

2:05:41.760 --> 2:05:44.760
 for ending up in a hospital

2:05:44.760 --> 2:05:48.020
 relative to all the other risks you face when you're older.

2:05:49.500 --> 2:05:51.480
 I don't understand.

2:05:51.480 --> 2:05:56.480
 Can you explain the policy around closing a university

2:05:57.120 --> 2:06:02.120
 but also just a policy about just being so scared still

2:06:04.680 --> 2:06:06.160
 in the university setting?

2:06:06.160 --> 2:06:09.840
 I think the great universities have done great harm

2:06:09.840 --> 2:06:12.360
 by modeling this kind of behavior.

2:06:12.360 --> 2:06:15.260
 Yes, to me, sorry to keep interrupting,

2:06:15.260 --> 2:06:17.840
 but to me, the university should be the beacon

2:06:17.840 --> 2:06:22.840
 of great behavior, not the beacon of scared, conservative,

2:06:24.600 --> 2:06:26.160
 let's not mess up.

2:06:26.160 --> 2:06:27.000
 Pathological.

2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:27.840
 Let's not make it pathological.

2:06:27.840 --> 2:06:29.860
 Let's not make anybody angry.

2:06:31.040 --> 2:06:33.880
 It should be a place to play in the space of ideas.

2:06:33.880 --> 2:06:37.680
 Yes, so I think the central problem is,

2:06:37.680 --> 2:06:39.080
 actually related to the central problem

2:06:39.080 --> 2:06:41.360
 of COVID policy more generally,

2:06:41.360 --> 2:06:45.240
 the goal seems to be to stop the disease from spreading

2:06:46.240 --> 2:06:49.700
 rather than to reduce the harm from the disease.

2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:54.040
 If the goal is to stop the disease from spreading,

2:06:54.040 --> 2:06:59.040
 the sad fact is we have no technology to accomplish that.

2:06:59.160 --> 2:07:00.240
 At this point.

2:07:00.240 --> 2:07:01.080
 Yes.

2:07:01.080 --> 2:07:05.160
 Like it's already deeply integrated into human civilization.

2:07:05.160 --> 2:07:07.040
 Well, I mean, it's here forever, right?

2:07:07.040 --> 2:07:11.120
 There's a zero survey of white tail deer in the US.

2:07:11.120 --> 2:07:13.440
 It turns out 80% of white tail deer in the US

2:07:13.440 --> 2:07:15.760
 have COVID antibodies.

2:07:15.760 --> 2:07:18.040
 Dogs get it, cats get it.

2:07:18.040 --> 2:07:20.880
 There's almost certainly human animal transmission of it.

2:07:22.480 --> 2:07:24.280
 I mean, presumably, I mean, I've heard bats get it,

2:07:24.280 --> 2:07:28.320
 apparently, so you have a situation

2:07:28.320 --> 2:07:30.640
 where you have this disease that's here to stay.

2:07:30.640 --> 2:07:31.480
 Yeah.

2:07:31.480 --> 2:07:33.320
 And the vaccines don't stop the spread of it,

2:07:33.320 --> 2:07:34.600
 the lockdowns don't stop the spread of it.

2:07:34.600 --> 2:07:37.400
 We have no technology to stop the spread of it.

2:07:38.400 --> 2:07:41.000
 And so we're burning the earth trying to stop,

2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:42.980
 do something that's impossible

2:07:42.980 --> 2:07:46.800
 rather than working on what's possible.

2:07:47.760 --> 2:07:51.880
 And so like letting regular college happen,

2:07:51.880 --> 2:07:53.160
 that's a great good.

2:07:53.160 --> 2:07:56.440
 Universities are a wonderful invention

2:07:56.440 --> 2:07:58.820
 and it's contributed so much to society.

2:07:58.820 --> 2:08:00.720
 Just decide to shut it down.

2:08:00.720 --> 2:08:03.360
 The universities should be fighting tooth and nail

2:08:03.360 --> 2:08:05.920
 to not be shut down, not the other way around.

2:08:07.200 --> 2:08:09.380
 Whatever the mechanisms that results

2:08:09.380 --> 2:08:10.480
 in the universities doing that,

2:08:10.480 --> 2:08:12.600
 that's probably, this is me talking,

2:08:12.600 --> 2:08:14.480
 it probably has to do with certain incentives

2:08:14.480 --> 2:08:16.800
 for the administration, probably has to do with lawyers

2:08:16.800 --> 2:08:21.180
 and legal kinds of things to avoid legal trouble.

2:08:21.180 --> 2:08:24.640
 But once again, it's when the administration

2:08:24.640 --> 2:08:27.300
 has too much power and too much definition

2:08:27.300 --> 2:08:29.200
 of what the policy is for the university,

2:08:29.200 --> 2:08:30.760
 that's when you get into trouble.

2:08:30.760 --> 2:08:33.300
 The beauty, the power of the university

2:08:33.300 --> 2:08:36.320
 should be about the faculty and the students.

2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:41.320
 Administration just gets in the way, get out of the way.

2:08:41.400 --> 2:08:43.160
 I mean, they can help organize things.

2:08:43.160 --> 2:08:45.880
 They play some important role, but they certainly do.

2:08:45.880 --> 2:08:47.560
 But they need to remember what the mission is.

2:08:47.560 --> 2:08:50.160
 The mission is not safety.

2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:52.420
 The mission, actually, universities should be

2:08:52.420 --> 2:08:55.980
 dangerous places for ideas and whatnot.

2:08:55.980 --> 2:08:59.220
 What is the role of fear in a pandemic?

2:08:59.220 --> 2:09:00.740
 We've been dancing around it.

2:09:00.740 --> 2:09:01.740
 Is it useful?

2:09:01.740 --> 2:09:03.220
 Is it destructive?

2:09:03.220 --> 2:09:05.860
 Or is there sort of a complicated story here?

2:09:05.860 --> 2:09:10.060
 Because they're taking us back into January 2020.

2:09:10.060 --> 2:09:11.460
 There was so much uncertainty.

2:09:11.460 --> 2:09:16.460
 This could have been a pandemic that is Black Death,

2:09:16.700 --> 2:09:17.820
 the bubonic plague.

2:09:17.820 --> 2:09:21.140
 It could have killed hundreds of millions of people.

2:09:21.140 --> 2:09:22.660
 We don't know that.

2:09:22.660 --> 2:09:24.100
 We're very new to this.

2:09:24.100 --> 2:09:25.180
 It's been a while.

2:09:25.180 --> 2:09:26.540
 We're rusty.

2:09:26.540 --> 2:09:29.460
 So there is some value to fear

2:09:29.460 --> 2:09:31.340
 so that you don't do the stupid thing.

2:09:31.340 --> 2:09:33.120
 You don't just go on living.

2:09:33.120 --> 2:09:34.180
 I guess where I come from,

2:09:34.180 --> 2:09:36.740
 I think it's almost entirely counterproductive.

2:09:36.740 --> 2:09:39.960
 I think fear should never be used as a tactic

2:09:39.960 --> 2:09:44.100
 to manipulate human behavior by public health.

2:09:44.100 --> 2:09:47.100
 So the fear on the individual level,

2:09:47.100 --> 2:09:48.740
 that feeling of fear,

2:09:48.740 --> 2:09:51.140
 you should be very hesitant about that feeling

2:09:51.140 --> 2:09:53.940
 because it could be easily manipulated by the powerful.

2:09:53.940 --> 2:09:54.780
 Exactly.

2:09:54.780 --> 2:09:57.940
 I think that fear is natural.

2:09:57.940 --> 2:10:02.940
 And it's not something that you have to stoke to get

2:10:03.580 --> 2:10:07.060
 when the facts on the ground suggest it, right?

2:10:07.060 --> 2:10:09.220
 In fact, the tendency for humans

2:10:09.220 --> 2:10:12.780
 in the face of threats from infectious disease

2:10:12.780 --> 2:10:16.420
 is to exaggerate the fear in their own minds

2:10:16.420 --> 2:10:19.960
 of being contaminated by the environment and by others.

2:10:19.960 --> 2:10:21.780
 That's just natural to humans.

2:10:21.780 --> 2:10:24.460
 And the role of public health

2:10:24.460 --> 2:10:27.180
 is not necessarily to eradicate the fear,

2:10:27.180 --> 2:10:28.700
 but obviously technological advances

2:10:28.700 --> 2:10:29.820
 can help eradicate the fear,

2:10:29.820 --> 2:10:32.700
 but it's really to help manage that fear

2:10:32.700 --> 2:10:37.700
 and help people put the sort of incentives

2:10:38.580 --> 2:10:40.420
 that come out of that to useful things

2:10:40.420 --> 2:10:41.820
 as opposed to harmful things.

2:10:43.700 --> 2:10:45.380
 What's happened in this pandemic

2:10:45.380 --> 2:10:49.100
 is that there's been a deliberate policy to stoke the fear,

2:10:49.100 --> 2:10:51.420
 to help make people think that the disease

2:10:51.420 --> 2:10:53.580
 is worse than it actually is.

2:10:53.580 --> 2:10:56.060
 In survey after survey, you see this.

2:10:56.060 --> 2:10:58.300
 And that's been incredibly damaging.

2:10:58.300 --> 2:11:02.380
 So young people have readily given away

2:11:02.380 --> 2:11:04.940
 their willingness to participate in regular life

2:11:04.940 --> 2:11:08.260
 because A, they fear COVID more than they ought,

2:11:09.260 --> 2:11:12.020
 and B, they fear that they're gonna harm the vulnerable

2:11:13.060 --> 2:11:14.700
 in their lives.

2:11:14.700 --> 2:11:15.820
 You put those two together

2:11:15.820 --> 2:11:18.340
 and you get this powerful demand for lockdowns.

2:11:18.340 --> 2:11:20.580
 You see this all over the world.

2:11:20.580 --> 2:11:23.460
 Broadly speaking, you have a powerful demand

2:11:23.460 --> 2:11:26.540
 for irrational policies, irrational policies,

2:11:26.540 --> 2:11:29.180
 because I would like to mention the flip side of that.

2:11:29.180 --> 2:11:32.780
 I've been saddened to see how much money

2:11:32.780 --> 2:11:37.540
 there is to be made by the martyrs,

2:11:37.540 --> 2:11:40.660
 the people, the conspiracy theorists

2:11:40.660 --> 2:11:45.660
 that tell you you should be afraid of the government.

2:11:46.140 --> 2:11:49.180
 You should be afraid of the man.

2:11:49.180 --> 2:11:51.700
 It feels like fear is the problem.

2:11:51.700 --> 2:11:53.740
 I think there's some guy that once said something

2:11:53.740 --> 2:11:56.060
 about we should fear fear itself.

2:11:58.900 --> 2:11:59.940
 He was a president or something.

2:11:59.940 --> 2:12:01.740
 I vaguely remember that.

2:12:01.740 --> 2:12:06.100
 So I'm worried about both sides here, that.

2:12:06.100 --> 2:12:07.740
 Well, I think the general principle

2:12:07.740 --> 2:12:11.380
 is that should not be a tool of public policy, right?

2:12:11.380 --> 2:12:13.780
 The public policy should attempt,

2:12:13.780 --> 2:12:15.100
 and public health policy in particular,

2:12:15.100 --> 2:12:16.860
 should attempt to address that fear.

2:12:16.860 --> 2:12:21.860
 It's not that you should tell people lies, of course not.

2:12:22.740 --> 2:12:25.300
 Tell people accurately what the risk is.

2:12:26.460 --> 2:12:29.020
 Give people tools that have evidence

2:12:29.020 --> 2:12:31.020
 that they can address their risk with

2:12:32.540 --> 2:12:36.180
 and level with people when we don't know.

2:12:36.180 --> 2:12:38.780
 I think that is the right adult way

2:12:38.780 --> 2:12:41.620
 to deal with this pandemic from a public health point of view.

2:12:41.620 --> 2:12:44.660
 And that is not the policy we have followed.

2:12:44.660 --> 2:12:47.500
 Instead, public health is intentionally stoked the fear

2:12:47.500 --> 2:12:50.500
 in order to gain compliance with its edicts.

2:12:50.500 --> 2:12:53.300
 And I think the consequence of that

2:12:53.300 --> 2:12:56.620
 is people distrust public health.

2:12:56.620 --> 2:12:58.620
 What you're talking about, the distrust of government,

2:12:58.620 --> 2:13:00.780
 I think is partly a consequence of that.

2:13:00.780 --> 2:13:03.340
 That movement, which is much smaller once upon a time,

2:13:03.340 --> 2:13:06.940
 is much larger now because of essentially

2:13:06.940 --> 2:13:09.100
 people look at what public health has done

2:13:09.100 --> 2:13:12.220
 and said they've lied to me a whole bunch of times

2:13:12.220 --> 2:13:15.340
 and a whole bunch of things is the general sense.

2:13:15.340 --> 2:13:17.260
 And there are consequences to that.

2:13:17.260 --> 2:13:20.100
 We're gonna have to work in public health for a long time

2:13:20.100 --> 2:13:22.900
 to try to regain the trust of the public.

2:13:22.900 --> 2:13:26.180
 Throughout all of this, you've been inspiring to me,

2:13:26.180 --> 2:13:27.740
 to a lot of people.

2:13:27.740 --> 2:13:32.660
 So you've been fearless, bold,

2:13:32.660 --> 2:13:35.940
 in these kind of challenging the policies

2:13:35.940 --> 2:13:38.980
 and not in a martyr kind of way

2:13:38.980 --> 2:13:42.260
 because you're walking the line gracefully

2:13:42.260 --> 2:13:44.460
 and beautifully, I would say.

2:13:44.460 --> 2:13:49.340
 And looking at that, I think you're an inspiration

2:13:49.340 --> 2:13:50.300
 to a lot of young people.

2:13:50.300 --> 2:13:53.940
 So I have to ask, what advice would you give them

2:13:53.940 --> 2:13:56.500
 if they're thinking of going into science,

2:13:56.500 --> 2:13:59.540
 if they're thinking of having an impact in the world,

2:13:59.540 --> 2:14:02.820
 what advice would you give them about their career

2:14:03.820 --> 2:14:05.900
 and maybe about their life?

2:14:05.900 --> 2:14:07.620
 Thinking about somebody in high school,

2:14:07.620 --> 2:14:09.740
 maybe in undergraduate college.

2:14:09.740 --> 2:14:10.620
 I'd say a few things.

2:14:10.620 --> 2:14:13.180
 One is, this is a wonderful profession.

2:14:13.180 --> 2:14:17.340
 You have an opportunity to improve the lives of so many

2:14:17.340 --> 2:14:19.180
 and do it by having fun,

2:14:19.180 --> 2:14:20.900
 the kind of play we're talking about.

2:14:20.900 --> 2:14:24.060
 It's an absolute privilege to be able to work

2:14:24.060 --> 2:14:25.220
 in this kind of area.

2:14:27.260 --> 2:14:28.580
 And to young people looking to say,

2:14:28.580 --> 2:14:32.740
 that have some gifts or desire for this area,

2:14:32.740 --> 2:14:35.780
 I say, please, go for it.

2:14:35.780 --> 2:14:37.620
 So this area of science broadly.

2:14:37.620 --> 2:14:39.580
 Yeah, I mean, it could be,

2:14:39.580 --> 2:14:41.260
 I mean, I don't have any gifts in AI,

2:14:41.260 --> 2:14:43.180
 but like, it could be your buddy,

2:14:43.180 --> 2:14:46.260
 or in health or in medicine or whatever,

2:14:46.260 --> 2:14:48.340
 whatever your gifts lie, develop them,

2:14:48.340 --> 2:14:49.300
 work hard and develop them,

2:14:49.300 --> 2:14:50.140
 because it's worth it.

2:14:50.140 --> 2:14:54.420
 It's worth it, not just because you get some status,

2:14:54.420 --> 2:14:56.900
 but because the journey is fun.

2:14:56.900 --> 2:15:00.540
 And the result is improvements in the lives of so many.

2:15:00.540 --> 2:15:03.220
 So I think that is the encouragement I give.

2:15:03.220 --> 2:15:06.020
 I'd also say, if you're looking at this ugliness

2:15:06.020 --> 2:15:09.260
 of this debate that's happened over the pandemic,

2:15:09.260 --> 2:15:10.580
 I'd say to young people,

2:15:10.580 --> 2:15:13.780
 we need you to come in and help transform it.

2:15:13.780 --> 2:15:15.100
 Many of the people you see in this debate

2:15:15.100 --> 2:15:18.460
 that behave poorly, I ask you forgive them.

2:15:18.460 --> 2:15:20.260
 I've done my best to try,

2:15:21.740 --> 2:15:25.980
 because many of them are acting out of their own sense

2:15:25.980 --> 2:15:27.380
 that they need to do good,

2:15:27.380 --> 2:15:31.580
 but the mistake they've made is in this arrogance

2:15:31.580 --> 2:15:32.420
 and this power.

2:15:32.420 --> 2:15:34.300
 So when you come in, remember that example

2:15:34.300 --> 2:15:35.780
 as a negative example.

2:15:35.780 --> 2:15:38.220
 And so that when you join the debate,

2:15:38.220 --> 2:15:40.460
 you'll join it in a spirit of humility

2:15:40.460 --> 2:15:42.460
 and a spirit of trying to learn

2:15:42.460 --> 2:15:45.860
 while keeping that love that led you

2:15:45.860 --> 2:15:48.260
 to enter the field in the first place.

2:15:48.260 --> 2:15:52.580
 And yeah, choose forgiveness versus like derision.

2:15:54.460 --> 2:15:57.500
 Like the people that you know have messed up,

2:15:57.500 --> 2:15:59.460
 like give them a pass,

2:15:59.460 --> 2:16:03.380
 because it feels like that's how improvement starts.

2:16:03.380 --> 2:16:05.700
 Funny, I've been thinking this is like,

2:16:05.700 --> 2:16:06.900
 I told you I'm Christian, right?

2:16:06.900 --> 2:16:10.140
 So like God has given me many opportunities

2:16:10.140 --> 2:16:12.700
 to forgive people, learned to practice how to do that.

2:16:12.700 --> 2:16:13.740
 Gave you a gift.

2:16:13.740 --> 2:16:15.500
 It's a very humbling thing, I guess.

2:16:15.500 --> 2:16:19.940
 Is there a memory from when you were young

2:16:19.940 --> 2:16:22.340
 that was very formative to you?

2:16:22.340 --> 2:16:24.580
 So you just gave advice to some young people.

2:16:24.580 --> 2:16:26.460
 Is there something that stands out to you

2:16:26.460 --> 2:16:31.460
 that a decision you made, an event that happened

2:16:32.220 --> 2:16:34.220
 that made you the man you are today?

2:16:35.540 --> 2:16:38.340
 I actually grew up in a relatively poor environment.

2:16:38.340 --> 2:16:42.700
 Like I was born in India and we moved when I was four.

2:16:42.700 --> 2:16:45.380
 My dad had eight brothers and sisters

2:16:46.340 --> 2:16:48.380
 and my mom had four brothers and sisters.

2:16:48.380 --> 2:16:52.380
 She grew up in the slum in Calcutta.

2:16:52.380 --> 2:16:54.820
 My dad, his dad died when he was young

2:16:54.820 --> 2:16:57.260
 and he supported his family, his brothers and sisters

2:16:57.260 --> 2:16:59.180
 with university scholarship money.

2:16:59.180 --> 2:17:02.540
 Came to the US and my dad worked in a McDonald's,

2:17:02.540 --> 2:17:04.100
 even though he's an electrical engineer,

2:17:04.100 --> 2:17:06.580
 couldn't find a job in 1971.

2:17:06.580 --> 2:17:08.220
 And so he worked at McDonald's.

2:17:09.220 --> 2:17:14.220
 We lived in a, like this, basically the housing port

2:17:14.340 --> 2:17:16.940
 like development in Cambridge,

2:17:16.940 --> 2:17:19.020
 this like this middle building on the 17th floor,

2:17:19.020 --> 2:17:20.580
 this like housing development.

2:17:20.580 --> 2:17:25.060
 I mean, I think that was transformative for me.

2:17:25.060 --> 2:17:27.300
 Like I didn't realize so much at the time

2:17:27.300 --> 2:17:32.220
 how that experience of being essentially like poor,

2:17:32.220 --> 2:17:36.300
 lower middle class, what effect it had on my outlook.

2:17:36.300 --> 2:17:37.460
 You mentioned to me offline

2:17:37.460 --> 2:17:38.820
 that you listened to the conversation

2:17:38.820 --> 2:17:40.620
 that I had with my dad.

2:17:40.620 --> 2:17:42.660
 What impact did your dad have on your life?

2:17:42.660 --> 2:17:44.980
 What memories do you have about him?

2:17:44.980 --> 2:17:46.740
 He was a rocket scientist actually.

2:17:46.740 --> 2:17:51.060
 He helped design rocket guidance systems.

2:17:51.060 --> 2:17:55.340
 He died when I was 20 and I still miss him to this day.

2:17:55.340 --> 2:17:58.660
 And I think that experience of seeing him

2:17:58.660 --> 2:18:03.660
 sacrifice himself for his family, brilliant man,

2:18:05.180 --> 2:18:08.580
 but in many ways frustrated with like his opportunities

2:18:08.580 --> 2:18:10.060
 in the world, which is probably what led him

2:18:10.060 --> 2:18:12.820
 to come to the US in the first place.

2:18:12.820 --> 2:18:16.660
 That's transformed, that's had a transformative effect on me

2:18:16.660 --> 2:18:19.380
 and I wish I could tell him that looking back.

2:18:21.660 --> 2:18:25.300
 Do you think about your own mortality?

2:18:25.300 --> 2:18:26.900
 Do you think about your death?

2:18:26.900 --> 2:18:29.380
 Your dad is no longer with us.

2:18:29.380 --> 2:18:34.380
 You're the old wise sage that represents.

2:18:35.780 --> 2:18:39.820
 I've only worried about death once in this pandemic.

2:18:39.820 --> 2:18:43.100
 Although I've had two, my cousin was 73

2:18:43.100 --> 2:18:47.860
 and my uncle who's 74 died in India during the pandemic.

2:18:47.860 --> 2:18:50.020
 And I grieve them both from COVID.

2:18:52.700 --> 2:18:55.500
 Like the fear of COVID really has only hit me

2:18:55.500 --> 2:18:58.940
 only really once during this and it wasn't for me.

2:18:58.940 --> 2:19:01.020
 And I recognize it's irrational.

2:19:01.020 --> 2:19:04.860
 So on the eve of the Santa Clara County seroprevalence study,

2:19:06.140 --> 2:19:07.940
 it was a really interesting thing

2:19:07.940 --> 2:19:10.700
 because so many people volunteered to help.

2:19:10.700 --> 2:19:15.700
 And my daughter who's 20, I guess she was 19 at the time

2:19:16.660 --> 2:19:18.420
 and my wife also volunteered to help

2:19:18.420 --> 2:19:21.020
 with like various aspects of the study.

2:19:21.020 --> 2:19:22.020
 And so the eve of the study,

2:19:22.020 --> 2:19:24.100
 they were going to go out in public

2:19:24.100 --> 2:19:25.780
 and I didn't know what the death rate was

2:19:25.780 --> 2:19:27.820
 because we hadn't done the study.

2:19:27.820 --> 2:19:30.300
 And I suspected it was lower than people were saying

2:19:30.300 --> 2:19:31.660
 but I didn't know.

2:19:31.660 --> 2:19:33.820
 I knew about the age gradient

2:19:33.820 --> 2:19:37.140
 because I'd seen the Chinese data and my daughter's young

2:19:37.140 --> 2:19:40.900
 but my wife is my age and I didn't know the death rate.

2:19:40.900 --> 2:19:43.620
 And I couldn't sleep the night before.

2:19:43.620 --> 2:19:45.860
 Like what if I'm putting my family,

2:19:45.860 --> 2:19:48.700
 my daughter and my wife at risk

2:19:48.700 --> 2:19:51.100
 because of some activity that I'm doing.

2:19:52.220 --> 2:19:53.420
 It was kind of, I don't know.

2:19:53.420 --> 2:19:54.260
 I mean, it was.

2:19:54.260 --> 2:19:58.700
 So it's worried about the wellbeing of others.

2:19:58.700 --> 2:19:59.540
 Yeah.

2:19:59.540 --> 2:20:00.420
 When you look in the mirror.

2:20:00.420 --> 2:20:01.420
 If I die, I die.

2:20:01.420 --> 2:20:04.180
 I mean, like I just, it's not, again, I'm Christian.

2:20:04.180 --> 2:20:07.940
 So I don't, death is not the end for me, I believe.

2:20:07.940 --> 2:20:10.580
 And so I don't particularly worried about my own death

2:20:10.580 --> 2:20:14.420
 but I do, I mean, I just, I think we can't help

2:20:14.420 --> 2:20:17.540
 but we worry about the wellbeing of our loved ones.

2:20:17.540 --> 2:20:22.180
 So from the perspective of God, then let me ask you,

2:20:23.340 --> 2:20:24.420
 what do you think is the meaning

2:20:24.420 --> 2:20:25.900
 of this whole journey we're on?

2:20:25.900 --> 2:20:28.060
 What do you think is the meaning of life?

2:20:28.060 --> 2:20:29.140
 You know, it's very simple.

2:20:29.140 --> 2:20:30.740
 Love one another.

2:20:30.740 --> 2:20:32.660
 Treat your neighbor as yourself.

2:20:32.660 --> 2:20:34.540
 It's love, as simple as that.

2:20:35.780 --> 2:20:38.220
 Well, I'd love to see a little bit more of that

2:20:38.220 --> 2:20:39.940
 in this pandemic.

2:20:39.940 --> 2:20:44.260
 It's an opportunity for the best of our nature to shine.

2:20:44.260 --> 2:20:46.340
 It's, I've seen some of the worst

2:20:47.700 --> 2:20:49.780
 but I think some of that is just good therapy.

2:20:49.780 --> 2:20:54.780
 And I'm hoping in the end, what we have here is love.

2:20:54.900 --> 2:20:57.580
 At the very least, make your dad proud

2:20:57.580 --> 2:21:01.660
 with some incredible rockets that we're launching.

2:21:01.660 --> 2:21:04.540
 I think you'd get along well with my dad, Lex.

2:21:04.540 --> 2:21:05.900
 I definitely would.

2:21:05.900 --> 2:21:06.740
 Thank you so much.

2:21:06.740 --> 2:21:08.860
 This is an incredible honor to talk to you, Jay.

2:21:08.860 --> 2:21:11.500
 You've been an inspiration to so many people

2:21:11.500 --> 2:21:13.340
 and keep fighting the good fight.

2:21:13.340 --> 2:21:15.740
 Thank you so much for spending your valuable time

2:21:15.740 --> 2:21:16.580
 with me today.

2:21:16.580 --> 2:21:18.460
 Thank you for having me here, appreciate it.

2:21:18.460 --> 2:21:20.100
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:21:20.100 --> 2:21:21.460
 with Jay Bhattacharya.

 And now let me leave you some words from Alice Walker.

2:21:29.520 --> 2:21:33.200
 The most common way people give up their power

2:21:33.200 --> 2:21:35.480
 is by thinking they don't have any.

2:21:35.480 --> 2:22:02.480
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
