00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
 The following is a conversation with Brendan Eich,

00:02.560 --> 00:05.700
 creator of the JavaScript programming language,

00:05.700 --> 00:09.200
 cofounder of Mozilla, which created the Firefox browser,

00:09.200 --> 00:12.860
 and now cofounder and CEO of Brave Software,

00:12.860 --> 00:15.440
 which has created the Brave browser.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.340
 Each of these are revolutionary technologies.

00:18.340 --> 00:21.120
 JavaScript is one of the most widely used

00:21.120 --> 00:24.920
 and impactful programming languages in the world.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.040
 Firefox pioneered many browser ideas that we love today

00:29.040 --> 00:31.280
 or even take for granted today,

00:31.280 --> 00:33.540
 and Brave is looking to revolutionize

00:33.540 --> 00:36.640
 not only the browser, but content creation online

00:36.640 --> 00:38.280
 and the nature of the internet

00:38.280 --> 00:40.680
 to make it fundamentally about respecting

00:40.680 --> 00:43.440
 people's control over their data.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.400
 Quick mention of our sponsors.

00:58.120 --> 01:00.840
 As a side note, let me say that there's a tension

01:00.840 --> 01:03.160
 between theory and engineering

01:03.160 --> 01:05.220
 that I've been thinking a lot about.

01:05.220 --> 01:06.960
 I tweeted something like,

01:06.960 --> 01:09.840
 "'Good execution is more important than a good idea,

01:09.840 --> 01:11.800
 "'but one helps the other.'"

01:11.800 --> 01:13.480
 I think the wording of that sucks,

01:13.480 --> 01:16.880
 but what I mean is a good idea is a must,

01:16.880 --> 01:20.740
 but in my experience, good ideas are in abundance.

01:20.740 --> 01:23.720
 Good execution, on the other hand, is rare.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.040
 I think some mix of good timing, good idea,

01:26.040 --> 01:28.160
 and good execution is essential.

01:28.160 --> 01:29.840
 Getting that mix right is tough,

01:29.840 --> 01:32.880
 and Brendan, somehow, multiple times in his career,

01:32.880 --> 01:34.260
 did just that.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.640
 I'm starting to believe it's more art than science,

01:36.640 --> 01:39.200
 like most interesting things in life.

01:48.840 --> 01:52.420
 And now, here's my conversation with Brendan Eich.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.000
 When did you first fall in love with programming?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.320
 I didn't program a lot when I was in high school,

01:58.320 --> 02:01.580
 but I had a friend who had a Commodore PET,

02:01.580 --> 02:03.160
 and after we saw Star Wars, he said,

02:03.160 --> 02:05.660
 "'Hey, let's make a basic program

02:05.660 --> 02:08.040
 "'that does the Death Star Trench run.'"

02:08.040 --> 02:10.960
 And it was just simple 2D graphics,

02:10.960 --> 02:11.840
 and I didn't know what I was doing,

02:11.840 --> 02:14.320
 so I just helped him out on the math and stuff like that.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.120
 I was a math and science kid.

02:16.120 --> 02:20.120
 I was really into the HP calculators of the early mid-'70s.

02:20.120 --> 02:21.600
 These were the RPN.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.440
 They were really strongly built,

02:23.440 --> 02:27.520
 and as Arik Goldfinger said of gold, divinely heavy.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.880
 There's probably some gold in them, too, gold metalization.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.300
 But they were awesome calculators,

02:31.300 --> 02:33.160
 and they had all the scientific functions,

02:33.160 --> 02:34.460
 so I was really into that.

02:35.420 --> 02:37.380
 So I aimed toward physics.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.640
 I was a little late for the, I think,

02:40.640 --> 02:42.460
 the 20th century golden age,

02:42.460 --> 02:43.760
 and I read a lot of science fiction,

02:43.760 --> 02:45.880
 so I was like, yeah, it's on the hyperdrives

02:45.880 --> 02:50.360
 and warp drives, and physics was not gonna get there quickly,

02:50.360 --> 02:52.480
 and I started hacking on computers

02:52.480 --> 02:55.040
 while I was studying physics as an undergraduate

02:55.040 --> 02:56.560
 at Santa Clara University,

02:56.560 --> 03:00.120
 and I dodged the Fortran bullet

03:00.120 --> 03:02.040
 because I was in the science department

03:02.040 --> 03:03.140
 instead of the engineering department,

03:03.140 --> 03:05.720
 where they still did Fortran card decks.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.520
 I think they had an auto collator.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.320
 But we were using Pascal,

03:09.320 --> 03:14.320
 and I got one of the first portable C Compilers ports

03:15.200 --> 03:17.760
 to the DEC minicomputers we were using,

03:17.760 --> 03:19.320
 and I fell in love with programming

03:19.320 --> 03:24.320
 just based on procedural abstraction, Pascal,

03:25.880 --> 03:28.880
 just what now would be considered old school,

03:28.880 --> 03:31.600
 like structured programming from the 70s.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.480
 Niklaus Wirth, the creator of Pascal,

03:33.480 --> 03:36.160
 was a good writer and a good pedagogue, right?

03:36.160 --> 03:38.220
 He always at ETH would do these courses

03:38.220 --> 03:40.120
 where it's like build your own computer,

03:40.120 --> 03:42.720
 build your own compiler, build your own operating system.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.220
 It was scratch. Yeah, kind of.

03:44.220 --> 03:47.120
 And I know some people who were grad students under him

03:47.120 --> 03:50.480
 and said he would torture the students

03:50.480 --> 03:52.260
 with things like this custom email system

03:52.260 --> 03:56.820
 that had 25 word limit and things like that.

03:56.820 --> 03:59.240
 I unfortunately dodged both the Pascal

03:59.240 --> 04:00.740
 and the Fortran bullets.

04:00.740 --> 04:04.760
 Could you maybe linger on the Pascal?

04:04.760 --> 04:06.320
 What kind of programming language was it?

04:06.320 --> 04:08.160
 What is it reminiscent of today?

04:08.160 --> 04:11.440
 Because it sounds like it may have had an impact

04:11.440 --> 04:12.600
 on your own trajectory.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.460
 Yeah, it was in the ALGOL family,

04:14.460 --> 04:19.460
 and ALGOL was the big successful language design

04:20.960 --> 04:23.160
 and compiler project in the 60s.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.960
 It had a successor called ALGOL 68,

04:24.960 --> 04:27.440
 which was ambitious but not as successful.

04:27.440 --> 04:31.000
 But Pascal was kind of wordy procedures

04:31.000 --> 04:32.580
 and functions language.

04:32.580 --> 04:33.920
 It distinguished between functions

04:33.920 --> 04:36.160
 which return a value and procedures which don't,

04:36.160 --> 04:37.880
 which just compute.

04:37.880 --> 04:42.580
 And you could say that whole ALGOL family went into ADA.

04:42.580 --> 04:44.560
 Pascal had a second life thanks to Borland

04:44.560 --> 04:48.040
 with Turbo Pascal, which was hugely successful.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.000
 I think in large part due to Anders Helberg,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.820
 who then went to Microsoft and did C Sharp and done that

04:53.820 --> 04:55.520
 with his team there and has done really well

04:55.520 --> 04:58.000
 doing TypeScript, type JavaScript.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.800
 So yeah, there's a lineage here.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.800
 But I was also interested in C and Unix

05:03.800 --> 05:05.680
 by the time I was an undergrad

05:05.680 --> 05:07.840
 because people were bringing Unix up

05:07.840 --> 05:09.240
 on all sorts of hardware.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.200
 I had some friends who were doing

05:10.200 --> 05:14.480
 their own wirewrapped computers, 6820 maybe.

05:14.480 --> 05:19.160
 And I was wirewrapping for my engineering course,

05:19.160 --> 05:22.480
 6809 or something simpler, building a computer on a board.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.720
 And I wanted to build a more ambitious one

05:24.720 --> 05:26.960
 and port Unix to it, but I picked the wrong processor.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.960
 I picked the National Semiconductor NS16032,

05:30.960 --> 05:33.440
 which was this amazing, you know,

05:33.440 --> 05:37.200
 CISC, complex instruction set computer,

05:37.200 --> 05:39.360
 and not the reduced instruction set computers

05:39.360 --> 05:43.740
 that were just being contemplated into the mid eighties.

05:43.740 --> 05:45.440
 And RISC ultimately went out.

05:45.440 --> 05:48.360
 RISC won in some ways, it dissolved into,

05:48.360 --> 05:50.800
 you have both now, you have these super scalar architectures

05:50.800 --> 05:54.160
 where like Intel has kept probably too much

05:54.160 --> 05:56.800
 backward compatibility at the instruction level,

05:56.800 --> 05:58.920
 but that's just, there's a front end that parses that

05:58.920 --> 06:01.240
 into these, you know, these wide internal instructions.

06:01.240 --> 06:04.440
 So, you know, the very long instruction word research

06:04.440 --> 06:06.900
 that was also interesting at the time

06:06.900 --> 06:08.560
 kind of became the micro architecture

06:08.560 --> 06:11.440
 inside the backward compatible Intel.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.160
 But I picked a National Semi chip

06:13.160 --> 06:14.840
 and it never got made successfully.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.800
 It was full of bugs and I never could have brought it up.

06:17.800 --> 06:21.160
 But I went on out of physics after three years

06:21.160 --> 06:23.240
 into math, computer science.

06:23.240 --> 06:25.740
 And like I said, I did it because I saw,

06:25.740 --> 06:28.420
 I was being sort of childlike and naive about physics.

06:28.420 --> 06:32.120
 And I thought, meanwhile, the Valley is go go for computers.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.700
 The Apple II, right?

06:33.700 --> 06:38.700
 The PC, the Intel 8086, 8088 based PC,

06:40.720 --> 06:45.040
 the IBM, you know, gave Microsoft the future for,

06:45.040 --> 06:46.800
 you know, somewhat fishy deal.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.640
 So it was wide open in the computing space,

06:48.640 --> 06:52.200
 but in physics, you were as optimistic about physics as?

06:52.200 --> 06:54.680
 No, I mean, I was one of three brothers

06:54.680 --> 06:56.060
 who were all in the same grade.

06:56.060 --> 07:00.920
 I have a twin and a younger brother who skipped second grade

07:00.920 --> 07:02.980
 and was with us the whole time after that.

07:02.980 --> 07:04.480
 And, you know, he went on,

07:04.480 --> 07:07.520
 he actually studied under Kip Thorne at Caltech.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.560
 But he also didn't, he ended up in software.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.340
 He didn't talk about physics stuff.

07:12.340 --> 07:16.080
 Does it make you sad that theoretical physics,

07:16.080 --> 07:17.120
 even with string theory,

07:17.120 --> 07:20.920
 hasn't really had any foundational breakthroughs

07:20.920 --> 07:23.320
 in the latter part of the 20th century?

07:23.320 --> 07:25.220
 Yeah, in fact, I'd say the problem is theory

07:25.220 --> 07:27.120
 over experiment.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.920
 I would say, you know, we need more Aristotle

07:29.920 --> 07:31.240
 and less Plato.

07:31.240 --> 07:33.800
 You know, mathematics is not all physical.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.280
 There are lots of mathematics that cannot be realized

07:36.280 --> 07:38.360
 as far as I know in this world.

07:38.360 --> 07:41.000
 So to understand the world, you need to do experiments.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.200
 You need to not just dream up inductive theories

07:45.200 --> 07:47.880
 that could have lots of alternative theories

07:47.880 --> 07:50.120
 competing with them, with no way to decide between them,

07:50.120 --> 07:53.000
 except aesthetics, which is not a good guide in my opinion.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.760
 Yeah, I don't know if you are friends

07:54.760 --> 07:56.880
 or have a relationship with Elon Musk.

07:56.880 --> 08:00.520
 Where's the, in terms of like what you would love to see

08:00.520 --> 08:02.800
 our society investing in, building up,

08:02.800 --> 08:07.080
 is it closer to Elon or is it closer to Feynman

08:07.080 --> 08:09.120
 and Einstein and those?

08:09.120 --> 08:10.600
 Well, those gentlemen are no longer with us

08:10.600 --> 08:12.000
 and I think that's noticed.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.480
 So like I said, the real glory days of physics,

08:14.480 --> 08:17.280
 the famous pictures from Germany before the second war

08:17.280 --> 08:21.760
 were just a fantastic assembly of brains,

08:21.760 --> 08:23.120
 Schrodinger and Einstein.

08:23.120 --> 08:26.320
 And physics, I think, took a wrong turn

08:26.320 --> 08:30.040
 that maybe all of, I would say, Western science

08:30.040 --> 08:33.760
 took in going for models over reality, right?

08:33.760 --> 08:35.320
 You see this in all sorts of fields.

08:35.320 --> 08:38.000
 Now, we can build models that are very predictive

08:38.000 --> 08:40.320
 and generative and then we build actual devices

08:40.320 --> 08:42.200
 or semiconductors, things like that.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.440
 That's good, I'm not dismissing that.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.880
 We need good models, we need to experiment

08:46.880 --> 08:49.680
 and prove them and test them.

08:49.680 --> 08:51.920
 But the problem I've seen in physics,

08:51.920 --> 08:55.640
 which you see certainly in economics, the dismal science,

08:55.640 --> 08:59.080
 and you see surprisingly in other so called hard sciences

08:59.080 --> 09:03.200
 is models that don't really have to be

09:04.320 --> 09:05.440
 tested against reality.

09:05.440 --> 09:07.640
 They can instead become policy tools

09:07.640 --> 09:09.920
 or they can become, like I said,

09:09.920 --> 09:12.960
 one of a large family of alternate theories

09:12.960 --> 09:14.640
 that could be as predictive

09:14.640 --> 09:17.000
 but nobody's doing the winnowing out.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.920
 That's such an interesting tension in society.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.000
 You see this in even the software scientists

09:21.000 --> 09:24.440
 which have a deep love for psychology.

09:24.440 --> 09:27.200
 You see this in epidemiology, not with the virus.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.040
 Absolutely.

09:28.040 --> 09:31.280
 There's this tension of how much of the world

09:31.280 --> 09:35.040
 can we understand through just a beautifully fit model?

09:35.040 --> 09:37.640
 And then at the same time, my main work

09:37.640 --> 09:41.000
 is in machine learning where it's like

09:41.000 --> 09:44.400
 there is no provable thing usually.

09:44.400 --> 09:47.760
 It's all about just getting the right data set

09:47.760 --> 09:49.640
 and getting tricks and so on.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.760
 And there's this tension even in my own soul

09:51.760 --> 09:55.680
 of I grew up on theoretical computer science.

09:55.680 --> 09:58.920
 I loved approximation algorithms,

09:58.920 --> 10:01.920
 all of that different complexity classes,

10:01.920 --> 10:03.960
 just those little puzzles.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.200
 I mean, I don't know, to you as somebody

10:06.200 --> 10:08.600
 who was in math and computer science

10:08.600 --> 10:11.280
 and then ended up going into places

10:11.280 --> 10:13.880
 where you engineer some of the most impactful things

10:13.880 --> 10:18.680
 in this world, do you see the P versus NP,

10:18.680 --> 10:21.280
 all that whole space is interesting at all?

10:21.280 --> 10:24.640
 Yeah, it's not that useful in practice.

10:24.640 --> 10:27.920
 People are using it with sort of crypto analysis

10:27.920 --> 10:31.760
 or asymptotic arguments about can we have

10:31.760 --> 10:35.320
 a quantum resistant crypto algorithm, things like that,

10:35.320 --> 10:36.560
 which may not be practical, right?

10:36.560 --> 10:40.400
 If you follow Mikhail Diakonov or Gil Kalai,

10:40.400 --> 10:43.640
 there are big questions about how quantum computing

10:43.640 --> 10:46.800
 will scale up, how practical it will be.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.880
 Is that something that you think about quantum computing?

10:49.880 --> 10:51.080
 Not except for spare time.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.560
 Like you said, I'm not using this kind of computer science

10:53.560 --> 10:57.680
 in practice because almost everything now is engineering

10:57.680 --> 11:02.160
 and finding ways to get computers

11:02.160 --> 11:03.320
 to be more useful for people,

11:03.320 --> 11:06.160
 which goes from design problems,

11:06.160 --> 11:07.440
 which are really kind of an art.

11:07.440 --> 11:09.960
 Like you said, anything you can't automate is an art.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.360
 Well, we can have machine learning compose music

11:13.360 --> 11:14.800
 and it can imitate, you can train it,

11:14.800 --> 11:16.040
 and it can sound kind of decent,

11:16.040 --> 11:18.680
 but maybe lacking that je ne sais quoi.

11:18.680 --> 11:23.560
 But user interface still, I think, requires human art.

11:23.560 --> 11:26.440
 So speaking of things that didn't follow

11:26.440 --> 11:30.480
 a perfect theory and model, JavaScript,

11:30.480 --> 11:31.320
 so there's two things.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.360
 One, it had an impact on the world at a huge scale,

11:34.360 --> 11:38.920
 obviously, and it also still is one of probably

11:38.920 --> 11:41.400
 the most popular programming language in the world.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.120
 So can we go back to the origin story?

11:45.200 --> 11:47.840
 Can you tell the story of how JavaScript was created?

11:47.840 --> 11:49.960
 Yeah, I was at Silicon Graphics

11:49.960 --> 11:53.080
 after graduate school for seven years,

11:53.080 --> 11:54.720
 and it got to be big and successful

11:54.720 --> 11:56.800
 and divisionalized and political,

11:56.800 --> 12:00.480
 and I thought kind of boring.

12:00.480 --> 12:03.960
 And a friend who'd been there went to one of the last

12:03.960 --> 12:06.040
 of the super companies, the super startups

12:06.040 --> 12:07.640
 in the early 90s.

12:07.640 --> 12:08.720
 There were several.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.840
 I suppose General Magic was a little after that

12:10.840 --> 12:11.920
 around the same time.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.360
 But Micro Unity was that company that I went to,

12:14.360 --> 12:16.880
 and it was because my friend Jeff Weinstein

12:16.880 --> 12:18.040
 had gone there from Silicon Graphics.

12:18.040 --> 12:21.960
 He recruited me, and Micro Unity was doing everything.

12:21.960 --> 12:26.080
 So this was like the ultimate sort of pretend grad school.

12:26.080 --> 12:29.360
 It was doing a new fab, new semiconductor process.

12:29.360 --> 12:32.600
 It was doing new analog and digital circuits

12:32.600 --> 12:36.080
 on the same very large but not wafer scale chip.

12:36.080 --> 12:40.400
 Originally, it was five centimeters on a side.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.880
 It was really hot too, so I needed a water cooler.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.280
 It was a Craykiller, and then they shrunk it,

12:46.280 --> 12:49.360
 and they tried to do a home sort of media processor

12:49.360 --> 12:51.920
 that was essentially a barrel processor.

12:51.920 --> 12:55.440
 But you could think of trying to do all the things

12:55.440 --> 12:58.160
 that we now see in modern architectures

12:58.160 --> 13:00.240
 with short vector instructions

13:00.240 --> 13:05.120
 and sort of wide instructions or multiple issue,

13:05.120 --> 13:07.520
 and doing a lot of the stuff in software

13:07.520 --> 13:10.120
 because the second iteration, the set top box,

13:10.120 --> 13:13.040
 was really for avoiding the cost to the cable company

13:13.040 --> 13:14.520
 of rolling the trucks out

13:14.520 --> 13:17.560
 to replace your garbage General Atlantic set top box

13:17.560 --> 13:21.000
 with a totally newer, less garbagey one.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.860
 So if you could have software gradable set top boxes,

13:23.860 --> 13:26.200
 the cable companies thought they could save a lot of money

13:26.200 --> 13:27.160
 and add features.

13:27.160 --> 13:30.240
 Is this assembly, or which level of the software?

13:30.240 --> 13:33.800
 It was like, we were writing in, we were using GCC.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.240
 We were writing C++ and C.

13:36.240 --> 13:39.880
 Somebody I worked with there, really very smart guy,

13:39.880 --> 13:41.680
 hired from a sort of Wall Street

13:41.680 --> 13:45.240
 hotshot programming consultancy,

13:45.240 --> 13:47.040
 did his own hardware design as well as software.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.380
 And we were working on how to make

13:49.380 --> 13:50.740
 not only a short vector units,

13:50.740 --> 13:53.080
 but general bit shufflers and permuters.

13:53.080 --> 13:57.440
 So you could do things like crypto algorithms efficiently,

13:57.440 --> 14:01.400
 and you could do demodulation of the cable,

14:01.400 --> 14:05.240
 complex quadrature amplitude modulated signal.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.980
 So you're basically taking A to D converters,

14:07.980 --> 14:09.000
 dumping things in buffers,

14:09.000 --> 14:10.740
 and then doing the rest in software.

14:10.740 --> 14:13.480
 All the framing and the Reed Solomon and Viterbi

14:13.480 --> 14:14.480
 and all that error correction.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.060
 So that was really great learning experience,

14:16.060 --> 14:16.920
 but it was not gonna work.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.660
 It was doing too many risky things at once, right?

14:18.660 --> 14:20.460
 If you, as Jim Clark said to me,

14:20.460 --> 14:23.200
 when I hopped to Netscape after three years at MicroUnity,

14:23.200 --> 14:26.040
 he said, oh yeah, you do 10 things each,

14:26.040 --> 14:28.580
 one in 10 odds, it's gonna be one in 10 billion, right?

14:29.840 --> 14:31.080
 The multiplication principle.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.360
 So, Netscape was already a rocket,

14:33.360 --> 14:36.760
 and I passed the chance to go there in 1994.

14:36.760 --> 14:39.200
 I knew the founders because I worked at SGI,

14:39.200 --> 14:40.040
 Clark's company.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.200
 Could you pause for a second in Netscape?

14:42.200 --> 14:44.800
 When was the launch of this rocket?

14:44.800 --> 14:45.840
 94.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.320
 94 was the launch of Netscape?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.720
 And I went there in early 95 in April.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.200
 Okay, so you said you missed the launch.

14:52.200 --> 14:55.560
 Well, I missed the first floor employment opportunity,

14:55.560 --> 14:58.960
 but the IPO was August 1995, so I was there for that.

14:58.960 --> 15:02.280
 How obvious was it that Netscape was like world changing?

15:02.280 --> 15:04.080
 What was the layout?

15:04.080 --> 15:06.160
 Was Netscape one of the first big browsers?

15:06.160 --> 15:09.280
 Yes, so when I was at MicroUnity still in 93,

15:09.280 --> 15:11.720
 we saw a browser called Mosaic.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.760
 And up till then, we'd used email and we'd used Usenet,

15:14.760 --> 15:18.680
 the NNTP protocol, we'd use news readers, we used FTP,

15:18.680 --> 15:20.860
 we used all these old internet protocols,

15:20.860 --> 15:24.760
 all relying on the DNS and TCP IP and UDP for that matter.

15:25.720 --> 15:26.800
 When I was at Silicon Graphics,

15:26.800 --> 15:28.140
 we brought up the whole stack, right?

15:28.140 --> 15:31.760
 We had to discover how to find the ethernet addresses

15:31.760 --> 15:34.720
 on your network and then find IP addresses for them,

15:34.720 --> 15:35.940
 ARP protocol, all that stuff.

15:35.940 --> 15:38.680
 And it was great because nobody knew in the 80s

15:38.680 --> 15:41.480
 what was gonna win, all the proprietary stacks

15:41.480 --> 15:44.840
 like IBM, SNA and DeckNet and all these other protocols

15:44.840 --> 15:46.320
 were saying, we're gonna do it

15:46.320 --> 15:48.080
 or it's gonna be heterogeneous future.

15:48.080 --> 15:52.520
 And instead it was Berkeley Unix and the TCP IP stack

15:52.520 --> 15:54.900
 that dated back to the ARPANET that won.

15:54.900 --> 15:57.680
 And I think we knew it, we all knew it at SGI,

15:57.680 --> 15:59.280
 but the salespeople didn't.

15:59.280 --> 16:02.080
 And so they kept trying to get multiple network stacks

16:02.080 --> 16:04.360
 interoperating, but in the end it won.

16:04.360 --> 16:08.120
 And so that was the internet and it was email and texty

16:08.120 --> 16:09.520
 and it was used and very texty.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.540
 And then Tim Berners Lee did his thing,

16:12.540 --> 16:14.120
 but I don't think I was paying attention.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.400
 And I think the date when he first did it

16:16.400 --> 16:19.580
 or when he wrote the famous emails and pushed back to 89,

16:19.580 --> 16:23.160
 but I noticed a mosaic in 93 because one of the things

16:23.160 --> 16:26.560
 that Mark Andreessen and Eric Bina did at NCSA

16:26.560 --> 16:31.320
 was they innovated on the early HTML standard.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.040
 They in particular Mark sent this email saying,

16:33.040 --> 16:34.360
 hey everybody, we think you should be able

16:34.360 --> 16:36.240
 to put an image in a page.

16:36.240 --> 16:38.400
 And you know when he sent that Eric Bina had already

16:38.400 --> 16:39.240
 written the code.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.920
 And I talked to Tim Berners Lee more recently

16:41.920 --> 16:43.080
 just a few years ago and he was like,

16:43.080 --> 16:45.880
 oh, we had another way of doing it and it didn't work out

16:45.880 --> 16:48.000
 because Mark shipped his in mosaic.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.040
 And this convinced me of several things.

16:50.040 --> 16:53.840
 One, the internet meant there was a huge first mover

16:53.840 --> 16:58.080
 advantage and being fast, getting on first mattered a lot.

16:58.080 --> 17:01.840
 And so Richard Gabriel of scheme and poetry fame

17:01.840 --> 17:03.160
 has written about this, the famous.

17:03.160 --> 17:06.320
 What's poetry? Well, he's a poet.

17:06.320 --> 17:07.160
 Oh, actual poetry.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.360
 Is he talking about some kind of something?

17:08.360 --> 17:09.200
 No, no.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.200
 I mean, he's the founder of Lucid,

17:10.200 --> 17:12.920
 which is where Jamie Zawinski worked before Netscape.

17:12.920 --> 17:16.320
 And Lucid was doing compilers and Lucid Emacs,

17:16.320 --> 17:18.240
 which was a fork of Emacs,

17:18.240 --> 17:22.680
 famously Jamie fighting against Richard Stallman, Stalmax.

17:22.680 --> 17:25.260
 And so Richard Gabriel, very, very brainy computer guy,

17:25.260 --> 17:27.360
 but also a poet, but he wrote a nice essay

17:27.360 --> 17:28.960
 that gets abused all the time.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.760
 In fact, Jamie's put a kind of warning in front

17:30.760 --> 17:32.640
 of his version of it on his site,

17:32.640 --> 17:34.400
 JWC.org called Worse is Better.

17:34.400 --> 17:38.240
 And this is about survival advantage of software

17:38.240 --> 17:39.780
 in the network world, in my opinion.

17:39.780 --> 17:41.440
 It's about Unix.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.720
 It started out being framed as Unix and Lisp,

17:43.720 --> 17:46.000
 good news, bad news, because all the Lisp people,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.320
 the MIT people were like, oh, you know,

17:48.320 --> 17:52.720
 the crown jewel scheme, this Faberge egg or Common Lisp,

17:52.720 --> 17:54.520
 this giant cathedral, of course we're going to win.

17:54.520 --> 17:55.740
 This is civilization.

17:55.740 --> 17:58.040
 And those, you know, those farmers in New Jersey

17:58.040 --> 18:01.320
 to borrow from the Sopranos, those picks down at Bell Labs,

18:01.320 --> 18:03.400
 they're just, you know, there's nothing sound there.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.240
 It's all hacking.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.840
 Well, guess what won?

18:06.840 --> 18:09.960
 Wow, so you're saying this is a fundamental,

18:09.960 --> 18:14.800
 like principle of the internet is moving fast wins.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.960
 You could say in almost any network system,

18:16.960 --> 18:18.260
 like in biological evolution,

18:18.260 --> 18:20.720
 you see successful alleles sweep populations

18:20.720 --> 18:23.440
 and they don't always have, you know,

18:23.440 --> 18:24.480
 they aren't free of flaws.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.360
 They're heterozygous advantage, right?

18:26.360 --> 18:30.200
 You can get both parents give you the gene variant

18:30.200 --> 18:31.800
 and you get sickle cell anemia, right?

18:31.800 --> 18:34.680
 But if one of them does, you're more resistant to malaria.

18:34.680 --> 18:38.160
 And so this isn't a beautiful process,

18:38.160 --> 18:39.520
 except at large scale.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.520
 And then you realize that because it moves fast

18:41.520 --> 18:44.200
 and can adapt, it can win.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.600
 And people still struggle with this.

18:46.600 --> 18:47.880
 I used to struggle with this

18:47.880 --> 18:50.120
 because JavaScript was done in such a hurry

18:50.120 --> 18:52.980
 and the force of web compatibility meant

18:52.980 --> 18:55.240
 early mistakes couldn't be fixed.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.680
 And even the standards process injected new mistakes,

18:57.680 --> 18:59.040
 as it will.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.400
 But often standards bodies go back

19:00.400 --> 19:01.680
 and making compatible changes.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.080
 You can't do that with the web.

19:03.080 --> 19:05.200
 It's more like, again, like biology,

19:05.200 --> 19:07.120
 you preserve what still works.

19:07.120 --> 19:10.360
 You don't want to break ATP metabolism or whatever.

19:10.360 --> 19:15.140
 So you have to kind of resign yourself to the reality

19:15.140 --> 19:20.000
 of worse is better being enshrined

19:20.000 --> 19:23.120
 in actual design points you might not like.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.780
 And that happened with JavaScript and I'm way over it,

19:25.780 --> 19:28.880
 but it also, I think was a huge advantage.

19:28.880 --> 19:31.160
 That's why JavaScript has kind of swept

19:31.160 --> 19:33.400
 a lot of programming domains.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.840
 People will say, oh, it's not because of merit.

19:34.840 --> 19:35.660
 Well, you're right.

19:35.660 --> 19:37.600
 But we also improved it over time in the standards body.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.320
 I spent 20 years doing that.

19:39.320 --> 19:41.760
 And you don't get that choice.

19:41.760 --> 19:45.360
 It's like, I'm not saying that that was the best language.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.360
 I'm just saying that was the right time to do it.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.280
 And I like to say the alternative was not to do it.

19:50.280 --> 19:52.180
 I could have told Netscape, I can't do this.

19:52.180 --> 19:53.200
 It's too rushed.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.260
 And it would have been visual basic script.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.180
 And it would have been bad.

19:57.180 --> 19:59.780
 So that's a good way to present the alternative.

19:59.780 --> 20:03.020
 But so it was a Netscape and you have written it

20:03.020 --> 20:05.860
 in how many days and why was it only that many days?

20:05.860 --> 20:08.880
 And what was the goal and the underlying principles

20:08.880 --> 20:09.720
 in your mind at the time?

20:09.720 --> 20:11.740
 So the whole, I'm sort of describing worse is better

20:11.740 --> 20:14.980
 in a frenetic way because it fit the model of Netscape.

20:14.980 --> 20:18.420
 When it was known that Jim Clark

20:18.420 --> 20:20.020
 and Marc Inves were founding Netscape

20:20.020 --> 20:22.880
 and they did the first release in 1994,

20:22.880 --> 20:24.820
 that browser took over from Mosaic.

20:24.820 --> 20:27.100
 In fact, that's why Mozilla is called that.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.260
 It's the Mosaic killer.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.140
 It's like the giant monster that kills Mosaic.

20:30.140 --> 20:30.980
 That's awesome.

20:30.980 --> 20:34.180
 And they knew they could, it wasn't that, again,

20:34.180 --> 20:36.220
 it's not like you're doing advanced scientific research

20:36.220 --> 20:37.380
 that is changing the world.

20:37.380 --> 20:41.020
 You're more like taking down the last iteration

20:41.020 --> 20:43.180
 on the browser, Marc did, which had images

20:43.180 --> 20:45.900
 and other importances before he stopped working on it.

20:45.900 --> 20:49.060
 And you're making Netscape the new thing that has images,

20:49.060 --> 20:51.720
 plugins, which was the way to do video back in the day.

20:51.720 --> 20:54.260
 It had something that's kind of died now for tiled windows

20:54.260 --> 20:56.000
 called frames and frame sets.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.280
 HTML tables, that was new.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.640
 Eric Bina did tables in Netscape 1.1.

21:01.640 --> 21:05.040
 So when I got there, they were heading toward IPO.

21:05.040 --> 21:07.640
 Clark wanted the IPO early, I think his instinct was right.

21:07.640 --> 21:10.280
 And that kicked off the whole dot com era, right?

21:10.280 --> 21:13.280
 There was a recession in the US in 91.

21:13.280 --> 21:15.140
 You can see old law and order reruns

21:15.140 --> 21:16.520
 where they talk about the recession

21:16.520 --> 21:18.080
 and how hard it's hitting New Yorkers.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.440
 And after that, Greenspan really goosed things

21:20.440 --> 21:23.840
 at the Federal Reserve and technology had been sort of

21:23.840 --> 21:26.480
 fermenting in a way that came together with the internet.

21:26.480 --> 21:30.040
 And Netscape made it possible to do pets.com,

21:30.040 --> 21:34.280
 to do eBay, to get people to recognize a URL on a billboard

21:34.280 --> 21:36.040
 and then type it in when they get home.

21:36.040 --> 21:36.980
 And that was huge.

21:38.280 --> 21:42.120
 That was so fast moving a rocket that Marc

21:42.120 --> 21:45.060
 and the engineering team there thought,

21:45.060 --> 21:47.920
 we need to make this a programmable browser,

21:47.920 --> 21:50.840
 not just a document viewer, not just a video.

21:50.840 --> 21:54.120
 It was all HTML with images and tables and also,

21:54.120 --> 21:55.320
 like you said, frames.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.800
 There was no dynamic element at all.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.680
 Yeah, the most dynamism we get was from a plugin,

21:59.680 --> 22:01.640
 which there are a few of them then.

22:01.640 --> 22:03.960
 Flash didn't exist at that point.

22:03.960 --> 22:04.940
 It was, I think.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.400
 Java Applets yet or no?

22:07.400 --> 22:09.440
 Well, that's the thing we did to deal with Sun.

22:09.440 --> 22:12.600
 In fact, I was recruited to go do Scheme in the browser.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.800
 Remember Guy Steele and Gerald Sussman's

22:14.800 --> 22:16.760
 beautiful Lisp variant?

22:16.760 --> 22:17.920
 I was gonna do it in the browser

22:17.920 --> 22:19.480
 because my friends from SG, I thought,

22:19.480 --> 22:20.920
 hey, we like Scheme, you like Scheme.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.140
 And I'm like, I hardly ever use Scheme.

22:22.140 --> 22:23.360
 It's not really used in industry,

22:23.360 --> 22:27.080
 except in sort of silos, but I like it.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.760
 Okay, I'll come do Scheme in the browser.

22:29.760 --> 22:32.720
 I have a slide from my 2017 talk

22:32.720 --> 22:34.640
 where I have Bruce Willis crawling through the duct

22:34.640 --> 22:35.480
 in Die Hard.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.300
 He's like, come out to the coast, have a lot of fun.

22:38.300 --> 22:40.560
 Come on, do Scheme in the browser.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.160
 But when I got there, there was no Scheme in the browser

22:42.160 --> 22:45.240
 because they'd started a deal with Sun Microsystems.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.040
 And my best contact there was Bill Joy,

22:47.040 --> 22:48.960
 who I admired as a Berkeley Unix founder.

22:48.960 --> 22:50.600
 And, you know, Sun founder.

22:50.600 --> 22:53.920
 And Bill got the idea of making the browser programmable too.

22:53.920 --> 22:57.240
 And so the main idea was to put the Java VM,

22:57.240 --> 23:00.400
 which at that point was not really easy to embed,

23:00.400 --> 23:04.280
 into Netscape, including the Netscape version on Windows

23:04.280 --> 23:05.660
 that was still most popular,

23:05.660 --> 23:09.560
 which was the 16 bit Windows 3.1, which was going away.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.360
 Microsoft was coming out with Windows 95

23:11.360 --> 23:13.620
 and everyone was afraid they were gonna do

23:13.620 --> 23:16.200
 Internet Explorer, I guess, two at that point,

23:16.200 --> 23:17.080
 three the next year.

23:17.080 --> 23:20.960
 They already bought or invested in somehow Spyglass,

23:20.960 --> 23:24.440
 this other company that shot out from NCSA

23:24.440 --> 23:26.000
 at University of Illinois.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.740
 And in fact, Microsoft had tried to buy Netscape

23:29.740 --> 23:31.400
 in late 94, before I got there.

23:31.400 --> 23:32.280
 And I heard about this later.

23:32.280 --> 23:35.040
 I heard they offered way too little money.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.480
 And so, you know, Jim Barksdale and Jim Clark said,

23:37.480 --> 23:39.820
 get out of here, you know, pound sand.

23:39.820 --> 23:43.780
 But then they realized, oh, this is going to hurt us

23:43.780 --> 23:45.520
 because now they're gonna copy us.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.340
 Didn't happen right away.

23:46.340 --> 23:49.080
 I'm not sure when Gates internet title wave memo

23:49.080 --> 23:50.240
 was written.

23:50.240 --> 23:53.180
 That's the famous memo he wrote when Bill Gates realized

23:53.180 --> 23:56.840
 that Microsoft was going down this old copy AOL path

23:56.840 --> 24:01.100
 or copy CompuServe path, a project called Blackbird,

24:01.100 --> 24:03.240
 presumably after the SR71, I don't know.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.680
 But they were gonna make a, you know,

24:04.680 --> 24:07.600
 dial up service with a custom content language stack

24:07.600 --> 24:09.040
 and custom rendering.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.680
 It wasn't the web.

24:10.680 --> 24:13.200
 You know, they could have content partners.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.400
 They have a lot of money,

24:14.400 --> 24:15.920
 but it still wasn't to scale the web.

24:15.920 --> 24:16.880
 It wasn't gonna be compelling.

24:16.880 --> 24:18.200
 And Gates realized this,

24:18.200 --> 24:20.000
 and he turned the company on a dime

24:20.000 --> 24:22.400
 and they couldn't buy Netscape.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.320
 Again, I'm not sure the timing,

24:23.320 --> 24:24.540
 so they decided to copy it.

24:24.540 --> 24:27.400
 And once we realized that everybody inside Netscape

24:27.400 --> 24:30.920
 felt even more urgency and more of a frenetic mood.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.620
 And so my chance to do scheme disappeared

24:33.620 --> 24:35.840
 when the Java deal started brewing.

24:35.840 --> 24:38.800
 But there was still a chance to do a companion language

24:38.800 --> 24:41.080
 to Java because Java was a compiled,

24:41.080 --> 24:42.620
 is a compiled language.

24:42.620 --> 24:44.960
 It's evolved and improved quite a lot since then too,

24:44.960 --> 24:48.560
 but it was for sort of serious advanced programmers

24:48.560 --> 24:51.400
 that cost a certain salary or hourly rate.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.880
 And people observed, Bill Joy observed,

24:53.880 --> 24:55.760
 and Mark Andreessen and I observed

24:55.760 --> 24:57.900
 that in a mature stack like Microsoft,

24:57.900 --> 25:00.020
 you really benefit from having a scripting language

25:00.020 --> 25:01.680
 like Visual Basic,

25:01.680 --> 25:03.680
 which became Visual Basic script in IE3,

25:03.680 --> 25:07.120
 but didn't take over and kill JavaScript,

25:07.120 --> 25:08.340
 that you need two languages.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.160
 One is for the component writers

25:10.160 --> 25:12.560
 who are higher price and more expert.

25:12.560 --> 25:17.000
 And the other is for scripters,

25:17.000 --> 25:19.480
 certified public accountants, designers,

25:19.480 --> 25:21.720
 graphic designers with some programming inclination,

25:21.720 --> 25:23.460
 anybody, amateurs, doesn't matter.

25:23.460 --> 25:26.600
 There's a much more demotic approach there

25:26.600 --> 25:28.660
 for programming the components together,

25:28.660 --> 25:29.880
 gluing them together.

25:29.880 --> 25:32.800
 Some people say duct tape language, which I don't really like.

25:32.800 --> 25:36.080
 But we saw, Bill Joy and Mark Andreessen and I,

25:36.080 --> 25:38.020
 we saw the need for a companion language.

25:38.020 --> 25:40.400
 And the gleam in our eye was to call it JavaScript.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.480
 I didn't like it, that was marketing's plan.

25:42.480 --> 25:45.080
 Mark called it Mocha, which I liked.

25:45.080 --> 25:47.080
 And Netscape Marketing, I think, didn't like that.

25:47.080 --> 25:48.520
 So they said, oh, there's some trademark

25:48.520 --> 25:50.800
 and some software somewhere that uses Mocha,

25:50.800 --> 25:52.000
 so we can't use that.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.960
 And they tried LiveScript in August and that didn't last.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.680
 And then finally we got the trademark license

25:56.680 --> 25:58.720
 in December 1995.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.600
 But the work I did to prove that it could be done

26:01.600 --> 26:05.200
 was important because I came in in April

26:05.200 --> 26:08.320
 and even then Netscape was growing so fast

26:08.320 --> 26:11.280
 that they couldn't find an open hiring requisition

26:11.280 --> 26:12.320
 in the client team for me.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.280
 So they hired me into the server team.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.680
 And I worked for a month on server team

26:16.680 --> 26:18.600
 on what became HTTP 1.1.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.280
 So I was actually, I had done protocol work

26:20.280 --> 26:22.640
 at Silicon Graphics with Greg Chesson,

26:22.640 --> 26:25.360
 former Bell Labs intern, grad student intern

26:25.360 --> 26:27.020
 who knew all the Unix founders.

26:27.020 --> 26:30.880
 And Greg was very interested in taking protocols

26:30.880 --> 26:32.840
 to the next level with VLSI,

26:32.840 --> 26:35.640
 because he thought that CPUs wouldn't scale up.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.480
 He was mistaken in that, unfortunately.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.060
 Moore's law more than kept up.

26:39.060 --> 26:41.400
 And you have gigabit ethernet running

26:41.400 --> 26:42.520
 with conventional processors.

26:42.520 --> 26:45.680
 But I worked on protocols at SGI

26:45.680 --> 26:49.000
 as well as Unix kernel hacking and NFS and things like that.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.040
 So I came into Netscape to work on the server side

26:53.040 --> 26:55.260
 for a month, but I was thinking the whole time,

26:55.260 --> 26:56.360
 what should this language be like?

26:56.360 --> 26:58.480
 Should it be easy to use?

26:58.480 --> 27:00.680
 Might its syntax even be more like natural language

27:00.680 --> 27:04.840
 like HyperTalk, which is Bill Atkinson's language

27:04.840 --> 27:08.560
 in HyperCard, if you ever used HyperCard on an early Mac.

27:08.560 --> 27:12.080
 And I thought, well, I'd like to do that,

27:12.080 --> 27:15.160
 but my management is saying, make it look like Java,

27:15.160 --> 27:17.480
 which looks like C from a distance.

27:17.480 --> 27:18.320
 What does that mean?

27:18.320 --> 27:19.280
 Is it braces?

27:19.280 --> 27:20.400
 We're talking about visually?

27:20.400 --> 27:23.060
 Does that mean like, management,

27:23.060 --> 27:24.640
 do they understand what they think about?

27:24.640 --> 27:26.560
 Marketing didn't know, but management did.

27:26.560 --> 27:28.800
 Like Rick Schell, the VP of engineering, knew.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.720
 And we had a plan even that was,

27:31.720 --> 27:32.920
 if you have this companion language,

27:32.920 --> 27:34.560
 you're going to glue things together

27:34.560 --> 27:35.680
 between Java and JavaScript.

27:35.680 --> 27:38.800
 So you're going to have commerce in memory, in the heap

27:38.800 --> 27:40.240
 with data types.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.760
 So you're going to want some of the data types

27:41.760 --> 27:43.880
 in Java to reflect in the JavaScript.

27:43.880 --> 27:45.700
 You're going to want the primitive types

27:45.700 --> 27:47.540
 that Java unfortunately separated from objects.

27:47.540 --> 27:50.880
 So at least some of them, double, let's call it

27:50.880 --> 27:52.560
 in Java's terms from the C term

27:52.560 --> 27:54.500
 for double precision floating point,

27:55.640 --> 28:00.640
 or strings or Booleans and objects.

28:01.200 --> 28:04.000
 And so right away there was this constraint

28:04.000 --> 28:07.920
 that looking like Java meant kind of a C curly brace syntax

28:07.920 --> 28:09.800
 but also some of the data types and objects.

28:09.800 --> 28:12.000
 Like objects and so on, all that kind of stuff.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
 Comparison operator.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.480
 Garbage collection, all that stuff.

28:15.480 --> 28:17.640
 Even the bitwise operators and the shift operators

28:17.640 --> 28:19.580
 including the unsigned right shift,

28:19.580 --> 28:21.420
 which Java had because it didn't have

28:21.420 --> 28:22.720
 unsigned integer types.

28:22.720 --> 28:24.600
 It said, if you want to do unsigned operations,

28:24.600 --> 28:25.440
 use an operator.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.560
 And that turned out to be important much later.

28:27.560 --> 28:28.560
 I'll tell that story five time.

28:28.560 --> 28:33.560
 But JavaScript inherited a set of operators,

28:35.080 --> 28:37.160
 the expression grammar, the statement grammar

28:37.160 --> 28:39.360
 up to a point from Java.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.720
 But I wanted a functional language.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.840
 I wanted scheme, a little bit of scheme,

28:42.840 --> 28:44.600
 even though it wasn't as clean as scheme.

28:44.600 --> 28:45.440
 I wanted.

28:45.440 --> 28:46.260
 So you had a love, sorry to interrupt.

28:46.260 --> 28:47.600
 You had a love for scheme and list

28:47.600 --> 28:49.760
 but that functional language landscape.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.640
 Yes, I wanted first class functions

28:51.640 --> 28:54.000
 because I saw the need for callbacks in the browser

28:54.000 --> 28:55.880
 where it's a single threaded program.

28:55.880 --> 28:57.360
 All the early browsers were single threaded

28:57.360 --> 28:58.640
 and it's the right model for users.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.600
 Most users weren't ready for mutual exclusion

29:00.600 --> 29:01.680
 and threading.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.680
 So in a single threaded world,

29:03.680 --> 29:05.440
 you cannot block the user interface.

29:05.440 --> 29:07.520
 So you have to use a callback and run later.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.920
 And without getting too fancy

29:09.920 --> 29:11.640
 and trying to capture the continuation

29:11.640 --> 29:13.340
 like call CC does in scheme,

29:13.340 --> 29:16.640
 I thought I'll just make it easy to have fun arcs.

29:16.640 --> 29:18.860
 First class functions you pass downward

29:18.860 --> 29:21.800
 and it can call back, it'd be called back.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.640
 And Java didn't have that at the time.

29:23.640 --> 29:27.280
 It took forever to get proper first class functions

29:27.280 --> 29:30.720
 or lambdas now into Java, Java seven or eight, I think.

29:30.720 --> 29:32.120
 It did have concurrency, right?

29:32.120 --> 29:32.960
 Yes.

29:32.960 --> 29:33.780
 From the very beginning.

29:33.780 --> 29:35.680
 But you were thinking that the JavaScript

29:35.680 --> 29:38.160
 in the browser would not have the luxury

29:38.160 --> 29:39.360
 of being concurrent.

29:39.360 --> 29:40.200
 That's right.

29:40.200 --> 29:42.480
 And the reason was Java was gonna run in the plugins.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.560
 So it could fork threads and go to town.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.880
 But the main action in the browser

29:46.880 --> 29:48.280
 was in the single threaded program,

29:48.280 --> 29:51.880
 the single Unix process on Unix or Windows.

29:51.880 --> 29:54.400
 And it was where you had to service the event loop

29:54.400 --> 29:56.160
 and then go do things.

29:56.160 --> 29:59.360
 Respond to the network layout, some HTML, render it,

29:59.360 --> 30:03.200
 turn widths into heights by filling containers, boxes,

30:03.200 --> 30:06.080
 the early, what became the CSS box model.

30:06.080 --> 30:09.600
 And run scripts to make the thing livelier,

30:09.600 --> 30:11.160
 respond to user input.

30:11.160 --> 30:14.240
 And all that event driven programming

30:14.240 --> 30:16.080
 was in part like HyperCard

30:16.080 --> 30:19.440
 because HyperCard had this on event name syntax.

30:19.440 --> 30:21.680
 And so that's why you have in JavaScript on click

30:21.680 --> 30:24.120
 run together as the name of the event handler.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.060
 And there's some funny ones on mouse over

30:26.060 --> 30:28.200
 and on mouse out, people still complain about those.

30:28.200 --> 30:31.060
 But there were many more events now over the years

30:31.060 --> 30:33.980
 standardized, but it was a mix of event driven

30:33.980 --> 30:36.240
 single threaded programming because it had to run

30:36.240 --> 30:38.960
 in the main thread of the browser where the action is

30:38.960 --> 30:40.680
 and Java never got there.

30:40.680 --> 30:42.640
 Which meant Java could not interact easily

30:42.640 --> 30:46.720
 or quickly or in a nested way with the document,

30:46.720 --> 30:49.200
 with the objects reflected from the HTML document,

30:49.200 --> 30:50.960
 with the tables and forms and so on.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.960
 And that is one of the reasons I think JavaScript

30:53.960 --> 30:55.320
 survived and Java kind of died.

30:55.320 --> 30:56.960
 Java was in this plugin prison.

30:56.960 --> 30:58.760
 It essentially was confined to a rectangle,

30:58.760 --> 30:59.960
 the applet rectangle.

30:59.960 --> 31:02.720
 And while we even built next year,

31:02.720 --> 31:04.840
 Nick Thompson, a friend from SGI

31:04.840 --> 31:08.640
 who was an intern grad student at CMU at the time,

31:08.640 --> 31:10.280
 built the first version of Live Connect

31:10.280 --> 31:12.640
 to glue Java and JavaScript together

31:12.640 --> 31:14.680
 to deliver on that vision where you do have commerce

31:14.680 --> 31:16.840
 between the data types in the heap.

31:18.040 --> 31:18.880
 Did it work?

31:18.880 --> 31:21.280
 It worked, but Java was in charge.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.640
 JavaScript was in charge and Java was just these components,

31:23.640 --> 31:24.480
 these helper objects.

31:24.480 --> 31:25.920
 You might as well do everything in JavaScript.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.960
 What happened over time, it's like an evolutionary filter.

31:27.960 --> 31:29.600
 It just kind of, who needs the plugin?

31:29.600 --> 31:33.000
 And in fact, Sun mismanaged Java as a plugin.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.520
 They thought, oh, Netscape is giving us

31:35.520 --> 31:38.400
 the distribution vehicle and we don't care about the browser.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.680
 It's just about getting Java out there.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.220
 And that was a big miscalculation.

31:41.220 --> 31:43.840
 They then tried, because Microsoft's killing Netscape

31:43.840 --> 31:46.120
 after years, they tried getting into Microsoft.

31:46.120 --> 31:48.520
 And you may remember there was a Sun Microsoft deal

31:48.520 --> 31:50.640
 which famously blew up.

31:50.640 --> 31:54.800
 And Microsoft kicked Java out of Windows.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.400
 And that's when they really pulled the trigger.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.120
 I think they'd already evaluated it and liked it

31:58.120 --> 32:01.740
 on Anders Helzberg's.NET and C Sharp

32:01.740 --> 32:04.160
 and decided we're gonna just not have Java.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.440
 We don't want any of that Sun stuff.

32:06.440 --> 32:07.560
 We don't want the patent risk.

32:07.560 --> 32:10.080
 We don't want, I'm not sure what all fights were about.

32:10.080 --> 32:12.040
 There was some patent angle to it, I think.

32:12.040 --> 32:16.920
 And up till then, Microsoft had been using Java components

32:16.920 --> 32:19.240
 like in Outlook Web Access,

32:19.240 --> 32:21.480
 which had a lot of JavaScript to be a webmail

32:21.480 --> 32:23.120
 like Hotmail, like user interface.

32:23.120 --> 32:27.760
 They had to call the mail server through HTTP

32:27.760 --> 32:31.360
 and they used a Java object to do this.

32:31.360 --> 32:34.280
 And when they gave the boot to Sun,

32:34.280 --> 32:37.240
 suddenly the left hand gave the boot

32:37.240 --> 32:39.160
 and the right hand said, we better do something else

32:39.160 --> 32:40.080
 in Outlook Web Access.

32:40.080 --> 32:40.920
 What are we gonna do?

32:40.920 --> 32:43.640
 And they said, let's just add an ActiveX component,

32:43.640 --> 32:46.300
 which is their own native way of embedding things

32:46.300 --> 32:51.300
 in languages and it'll be what became XML HTTP request,

32:51.960 --> 32:54.760
 which is now a web standard for calling asynchronously.

32:54.760 --> 32:57.040
 And it's been replaced by the fetch API

32:57.040 --> 32:59.480
 in HTML5 or HTML living document.

32:59.480 --> 33:02.400
 But this whole lineage goes back to Java

33:02.400 --> 33:05.100
 being successfully the loser and getting kicked out.

33:05.100 --> 33:07.680
 And after Microsoft kicked it out, it was a plugin

33:07.680 --> 33:11.040
 and you would find it required for like smart card banking

33:11.040 --> 33:14.700
 in the Nordic countries where that was mandated by law,

33:14.700 --> 33:16.360
 but really didn't get used much.

33:16.360 --> 33:20.600
 Or there were pilots who used it for flight information,

33:21.560 --> 33:24.160
 but Flash, which Netscape could have bought,

33:24.160 --> 33:25.560
 but fortunately didn't.

33:25.560 --> 33:26.400
 The early days.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.080
 Yeah, we would have screwed it up.

33:28.080 --> 33:29.520
 What year are we talking about with Flash?

33:29.520 --> 33:32.160
 I think after the IPO, so it was probably late 95.

33:32.160 --> 33:33.320
 Oh, Flash was around.

33:33.320 --> 33:34.160
 Was it Adobe?

33:34.160 --> 33:34.980
 No, it wasn't.

33:34.980 --> 33:36.360
 No, it was called Future Splash

33:36.360 --> 33:38.720
 and it was these brothers, Jonathan Gay,

33:38.720 --> 33:41.720
 I think his name was, and he came knocking

33:41.720 --> 33:43.520
 and the marketing guy at Netscape,

33:43.520 --> 33:45.840
 who was screening the technology partners

33:45.840 --> 33:47.800
 or wannabe acquisitions was brutal

33:47.800 --> 33:50.320
 and just everybody wanted to get in on the Netscape,

33:50.320 --> 33:52.480
 stock gravy train and he sent them packing

33:52.480 --> 33:55.120
 and they ended up selling to Macromedia

33:55.120 --> 33:57.320
 and Macromedia was where Flash was created.

33:57.320 --> 33:58.960
 And the good thing about Macromedia was

33:58.960 --> 34:02.000
 it was a tool company.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.800
 So it invested in the best ideas, I think,

34:05.800 --> 34:08.120
 which are still somewhat lost to us of Flash,

34:08.120 --> 34:12.500
 the timeline, animation has sort of been a mutable function

34:12.500 --> 34:13.800
 over time.

34:13.800 --> 34:14.920
 They had the tooling around that too,

34:14.920 --> 34:17.240
 like they had Dreamweaver, there's a Flash.

34:17.240 --> 34:18.840
 Flash Director, there were a bunch of them.

34:18.840 --> 34:20.840
 Yeah, I mean, yeah, that was a great.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.800
 Flash Builder was one of the last ones.

34:22.800 --> 34:25.420
 These tools were used by real artists

34:25.420 --> 34:27.440
 and special effects people and designers.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.760
 All the restaurant websites around 2005

34:29.760 --> 34:32.280
 were done in Flash, which was,

34:32.280 --> 34:34.080
 we were trying to do HTML5 at the same time.

34:34.080 --> 34:35.080
 That was the Firefox era.

34:35.080 --> 34:37.640
 We were trying to make the web capable enough

34:37.640 --> 34:39.400
 you didn't need Flash, but if you recall,

34:39.400 --> 34:41.080
 you go to a restaurant and it's like,

34:41.080 --> 34:42.400
 this is kind of like a game or something.

34:42.400 --> 34:44.600
 It's like a Flash, all the font looks small.

34:44.600 --> 34:45.880
 So you didn't like Flash from the beginning.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.640
 You're like, this doesn't feel right.

34:47.640 --> 34:48.480
 Not really.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.000
 I actually admire Flash's technology

34:50.000 --> 34:51.700
 and I'm pretty pragmatic about these things.

34:51.700 --> 34:54.840
 And I realized that it doesn't matter

34:54.840 --> 34:58.280
 if your Delta bad hand like JavaScript was a rush job,

34:58.280 --> 35:00.240
 or if you have Flash as a plugin

35:00.240 --> 35:03.620
 and you can invest in the tools and make it pretty good.

35:03.620 --> 35:05.720
 You should make it better for your users

35:05.720 --> 35:07.000
 and grow it as best you can.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.800
 And what happened with the browser

35:08.800 --> 35:11.040
 due to Microsoft's monopoly abuse

35:11.040 --> 35:12.600
 for which they were convicted.

35:12.600 --> 35:17.440
 And even after that, until I think Firefox and then Chrome

35:17.440 --> 35:21.240
 was people kept saying, oh, the web can't do X, can't do Y.

35:21.240 --> 35:22.240
 We'll have to have a plugin.

35:22.240 --> 35:23.680
 We'll have to have a new approach.

35:23.680 --> 35:26.860
 We'll clean the slate and have a new web.

35:26.860 --> 35:28.960
 And everyone who said that failed.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.180
 And the reason they failed is because

35:30.180 --> 35:34.080
 there's too much value in the web, this huge network.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.040
 And the worse is better principle means

35:36.040 --> 35:39.460
 that you can not only start bad, which they all sneer at,

35:39.460 --> 35:41.920
 but get on first and get wide distribution,

35:41.920 --> 35:46.920
 get sort of evolutionary advantage in priority of place,

35:47.080 --> 35:49.320
 but you can also improve it over time.

35:49.320 --> 35:51.080
 And so if you're gonna improve Flash,

35:51.080 --> 35:53.000
 and for some reason Flash is now out of favor.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
 Steve Jobs said you can't have Flash on the iPhone.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.740
 That was probably the death knell.

35:56.740 --> 35:58.100
 Put your energy into JavaScript.

35:58.100 --> 35:58.940
 And that happened, right?

35:58.940 --> 36:02.400
 So we did things at Mozilla with Adobe to improve,

36:02.400 --> 36:04.860
 which bought my Macromedia, to improve Flash

36:04.860 --> 36:07.560
 and to improve the version of JavaScript that was in Flash.

36:07.560 --> 36:09.000
 We tried to standardize that.

36:09.000 --> 36:09.840
 Oh, that's right.

36:09.840 --> 36:10.660
 I'm getting ahead of myself with it.

36:10.660 --> 36:11.500
 It was ES4.

36:11.500 --> 36:12.340
 Yeah.

36:12.340 --> 36:13.180
 That's right, that's right.

36:13.180 --> 36:17.000
 Can we just rewind to the magical, like, you know.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.160
 It's a special moment in the history of all of computing.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.840
 We'll talk about it later, but it's arguable.

36:22.840 --> 36:25.280
 It's possible that the entirety of the world

36:25.280 --> 36:27.280
 will run in JavaScript at some point.

36:27.280 --> 36:30.040
 So like, it's like those days,

36:30.040 --> 36:33.320
 it would be interesting if you could just describe,

36:33.320 --> 36:38.320
 actually zooming in on how the cake was baked

36:38.320 --> 36:41.580
 from the several days that you were working on it.

36:41.580 --> 36:43.320
 What was on your mind?

36:43.320 --> 36:45.380
 How much coffee were you drinking?

36:45.380 --> 36:46.220
 Were you nervous?

36:46.220 --> 36:47.360
 Why, freaking out?

36:47.360 --> 36:48.360
 I'll try to remember it.

36:48.360 --> 36:49.200
 I mean, you're right.

36:49.200 --> 36:50.940
 There are these pregnant moments you see in hindsight,

36:50.940 --> 36:52.200
 maybe they're overrated,

36:52.200 --> 36:55.760
 but like Hegel sees Napoleon on horseback at Jena

36:55.760 --> 36:59.120
 and says, there's the world spirit on horse.

37:00.440 --> 37:04.120
 And I knew that there was a chance to do it.

37:04.120 --> 37:07.960
 Mark knew, and he was my executive sponsor

37:07.960 --> 37:10.800
 and he was the one sort of brainstorming

37:10.800 --> 37:13.360
 how the JavaScript should be right there in the page.

37:13.360 --> 37:14.760
 That was important for him to say that.

37:14.760 --> 37:17.360
 Cause I thought so too, but a lot of people were like,

37:17.360 --> 37:18.680
 well, you can't write programming language

37:18.680 --> 37:20.120
 in the middle of the markup.

37:20.120 --> 37:21.040
 And indeed there are problems.

37:21.040 --> 37:23.600
 If you did it naively, you'd see the code laid out

37:23.600 --> 37:25.300
 as like random gibberish.

37:25.300 --> 37:26.600
 So I had to figure out how to hide that.

37:26.600 --> 37:28.120
 That was a challenge.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.800
 Is that a breakthrough idea?

37:29.800 --> 37:32.580
 I mean, so you and Mark thinking about this idea

37:32.580 --> 37:36.080
 that you just inject code in the middle of the markup.

37:36.080 --> 37:36.920
 Of the webpage.

37:36.920 --> 37:38.000
 I consider kind of heretical.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.120
 There was an SGML guru, I forget his name,

37:40.120 --> 37:42.120
 but he corresponded with me and at first he was angry.

37:42.120 --> 37:44.760
 He's like, you should have used a marked section.

37:44.760 --> 37:45.960
 Why didn't you use a marked section?

37:45.960 --> 37:48.600
 And I said, well, SGML marked sections are not part of HTML

37:48.600 --> 37:50.600
 by the way, and they're not supported in the browser.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.540
 And so I did some hack that was equivalent

37:52.540 --> 37:55.280
 and over time you could do the proper SGML thing.

37:55.280 --> 37:58.200
 But eventually he came around and it was again,

37:58.200 --> 37:59.640
 sort of evolutionary necessity.

37:59.640 --> 38:02.920
 It was almost like introgression, like the idea

38:02.920 --> 38:06.980
 which Lynn Margulies, I think helped get across

38:06.980 --> 38:10.640
 that we have to consider mutualism biology

38:10.640 --> 38:14.080
 that maybe mitochondria were ancient prokaryotes

38:14.080 --> 38:17.420
 that got into the cell and became beneficial.

38:17.420 --> 38:21.200
 Somehow the same sort of thinking applies.

38:21.200 --> 38:23.040
 You have to embed JavaScript in HTML.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.760
 It's gonna be a good virus.

38:24.760 --> 38:25.720
 It won't hurt you.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.400
 The code becomes data in the sense

38:27.400 --> 38:30.040
 it just gets carried along.

38:30.040 --> 38:33.680
 But is there the side of the, so you were focusing

38:33.680 --> 38:35.080
 on Netscape at that time.

38:35.080 --> 38:38.360
 Doesn't the browser have to support interpret correctly

38:38.360 --> 38:41.440
 this mix of HTML and whatever code?

38:41.440 --> 38:42.720
 I had to hide it from old browsers,

38:42.720 --> 38:45.140
 including Netscape 1.1, which was predominant then.

38:45.140 --> 38:49.560
 So I used an HTML comment, but the inside the container

38:49.560 --> 38:51.080
 that comment lived in the script tag,

38:51.080 --> 38:53.480
 which is a new element, I could make different semantics

38:53.480 --> 38:57.040
 in Netscape 2 where those HTML comment delimiters

38:57.040 --> 38:59.760
 instead of being multi line brackets became one line

38:59.760 --> 39:00.600
 or essentially one line.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.600
 So you wrote, so JavaScript was written,

39:02.600 --> 39:05.080
 the programming language was written as a comment.

39:05.080 --> 39:08.120
 A comment for old browsers and a set of brackets

39:08.120 --> 39:10.160
 that were ignored with real code for new.

39:10.160 --> 39:13.480
 And it was this two way comment hiding hack, as I called it,

39:13.480 --> 39:15.700
 that was absolutely necessary for us to get off the ground.

39:15.700 --> 39:17.680
 We couldn't have bootstrapped JavaScript without it.

39:17.680 --> 39:20.240
 We didn't have scripts that were loaded from a separate file.

39:20.240 --> 39:22.900
 The only scripts in Netscape 2 were inline in the document.

39:22.900 --> 39:24.280
 What were the challenges here?

39:24.280 --> 39:27.440
 What, like what, you know, typing,

39:27.440 --> 39:30.120
 what were the choices you were thinking about?

39:30.120 --> 39:31.560
 What was the design for this garbage collection?

39:31.560 --> 39:32.960
 I didn't have time to write a garbage collector.

39:32.960 --> 39:34.680
 So I just, I didn't at first.

39:34.680 --> 39:36.920
 The thing was using essentially arenas

39:36.920 --> 39:39.160
 or what GNU calls object pools

39:39.160 --> 39:41.680
 and just would run out of memory eventually.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.560
 And I added reference counting in a hurry

39:43.560 --> 39:45.340
 after the 10 days in which I hacked.

39:45.340 --> 39:48.120
 So after I was in the server team doing HTTP 1.1

39:48.120 --> 39:49.640
 and thinking about the language,

39:49.640 --> 39:52.300
 I finally got transferred to the client team in early May.

39:52.300 --> 39:55.260
 And that's when I, you know, I got the go sign from Mark

39:55.260 --> 39:57.280
 and it was like, we can't wait

39:57.280 --> 39:59.360
 because people inside Netscape are doubting.

39:59.360 --> 40:01.880
 Even people inside Sun are definitely doubting.

40:01.880 --> 40:04.960
 Bill Joy was the champion, but he was like alone in that

40:04.960 --> 40:07.260
 in seeing that there was a role for JavaScript

40:07.260 --> 40:10.560
 as the, as I call it, the sidekick language,

40:10.560 --> 40:12.720
 robbing the boy hostage.

40:12.720 --> 40:16.360
 Frank Miller put it in the Dark Knight Returns

40:16.360 --> 40:18.640
 that there was this silly little language

40:18.640 --> 40:19.520
 that would be the glue language

40:19.520 --> 40:20.960
 and it could become important over time.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.880
 And you were better off having that complementarity,

40:23.880 --> 40:25.120
 that pairing of languages,

40:25.120 --> 40:28.080
 just like Microsoft stacked it with visual C plus plus

40:28.080 --> 40:28.900
 and visual pacing.

40:28.900 --> 40:33.120
 So what was the big moment of I'm done?

40:33.120 --> 40:34.320
 So I had to do a demo.

40:34.320 --> 40:35.800
 I forget the dates.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.680
 I think I, for a history of programming languages paper

40:38.680 --> 40:40.840
 that Alan Wiersbrock did with my help,

40:40.840 --> 40:42.760
 he did a lot of the writing.

40:42.760 --> 40:47.440
 I think it was the 10 days from like Thursday evening

40:47.440 --> 40:50.800
 through to the following weeks, you know,

40:50.800 --> 40:52.520
 the whole of that week and then into the Monday.

40:52.520 --> 40:53.360
 You get sleep?

40:53.360 --> 40:54.400
 Not enough.

40:54.400 --> 40:56.280
 And I was really going fast

40:56.280 --> 41:00.080
 because I had already used a lot of C compiler

41:00.080 --> 41:02.320
 and front end compiler knowledge

41:02.320 --> 41:04.700
 that I'd gained from undergraduate school.

41:04.700 --> 41:06.600
 When I started getting into computing

41:07.560 --> 41:10.040
 as a renegade physics major,

41:10.040 --> 41:14.640
 people were formalizing more efficient bottom up grammars,

41:14.640 --> 41:17.040
 parsers for bottom up languages,

41:17.040 --> 41:19.520
 really LALR one was the big thing.

41:19.520 --> 41:22.440
 And I studied all this and learned how to parse them.

41:22.440 --> 41:25.100
 And in the end, if you're doing C languages,

41:25.100 --> 41:28.640
 you often do what Dennis Ritchie did anyway,

41:28.640 --> 41:31.280
 which is the recursive descent parser.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.200
 You can hand code it.

41:32.200 --> 41:36.280
 And I did that for JavaScript in a blazing hurry,

41:36.280 --> 41:37.280
 mostly got it right.

41:37.280 --> 41:40.160
 I didn't have precedence inversion problems or other bugs,

41:40.160 --> 41:43.160
 but I copied a lot from Java and C.

41:43.160 --> 41:45.240
 And I tried to keep things simple,

41:45.240 --> 41:49.400
 like the equality operator in those 10 days sprint

41:49.400 --> 41:52.360
 between two objects of different dynamic type said,

41:52.360 --> 41:54.320
 no, they're not equal, their types are different.

41:54.320 --> 41:57.680
 And then after that, I had internal early adopters

41:57.680 --> 42:01.240
 and they were using JavaScript to match a number

42:01.240 --> 42:03.920
 against a database field that had been stringized.

42:03.920 --> 42:06.440
 And they said, oh, can we just have implicit conversion?

42:06.440 --> 42:07.720
 Like an idiot, I agreed.

42:07.720 --> 42:08.640
 I gave them what they wanted.

42:08.640 --> 42:10.680
 I was trying to please them and get adoption.

42:10.680 --> 42:15.200
 And that broke what equivalence relation

42:16.560 --> 42:19.600
 nature there was to the double equal.

42:19.600 --> 42:22.360
 There's some edge cases with not a number

42:22.360 --> 42:25.040
 that break that too, but it really broke it.

42:25.040 --> 42:26.960
 Having an implicit conversions in the operator

42:26.960 --> 42:29.360
 is something that people still roast me over.

42:29.360 --> 42:31.720
 So let's talk about two things.

42:31.720 --> 42:34.280
 One, it sounds like the comparison operator,

42:34.280 --> 42:38.760
 the equality operator is the thing that you regret.

42:38.760 --> 42:39.600
 So maybe you can.

42:39.600 --> 42:40.600
 Making it sloppy.

42:40.600 --> 42:41.440
 Making it sloppy.

42:41.440 --> 42:45.200
 So what is the biggest thing you regret in those 10 days?

42:45.200 --> 42:47.480
 And what is the biggest thing you're proud of?

42:47.480 --> 42:49.680
 So that making it sloppy came after the 10 days.

42:49.680 --> 42:51.880
 And my lesson there, which I've tweeted is

42:51.880 --> 42:53.160
 when people come to you saying,

42:53.160 --> 42:56.080
 can you please make it sloppy or add this cute feature?

42:56.080 --> 42:57.640
 The answer should be no.

42:57.640 --> 42:58.480
 And I should have known that

42:58.480 --> 43:01.200
 because I think Nicholas Viert, one of my heroes said,

43:01.200 --> 43:03.560
 the essence of design is leaving things out.

43:04.560 --> 43:06.200
 But during the 10 days, I also, like I said,

43:06.200 --> 43:08.560
 I was in such a hurry, I left out garbage collection,

43:08.560 --> 43:10.760
 came back to haunt me, but I got reference counting in

43:10.760 --> 43:13.960
 in time that people weren't running out of memory

43:13.960 --> 43:16.120
 right away on long lived JavaScript.

43:16.120 --> 43:17.760
 What happens when you don't have garbage collection

43:17.760 --> 43:18.600
 and you have objects?

43:18.600 --> 43:20.240
 Well, you just run out of memory.

43:20.240 --> 43:24.120
 And you know, at first you write a short script

43:24.120 --> 43:25.920
 and the page doesn't last long or it doesn't do a lot.

43:25.920 --> 43:26.760
 It's okay.

43:26.760 --> 43:27.600
 Oh, I see, yeah, yeah.

43:27.600 --> 43:28.600
 But if you're writing a game or something

43:28.600 --> 43:30.600
 and you're doing event based allocation,

43:30.600 --> 43:31.680
 you run out of memory.

43:31.680 --> 43:34.320
 And this was noticed in the summer of 1985

43:34.320 --> 43:35.720
 and people were like, what's going on?

43:35.720 --> 43:38.600
 Oh yeah, I better go back and do reference counting.

43:38.600 --> 43:40.200
 And then the problem with reference counting is

43:40.200 --> 43:43.160
 you're writing the language in the runtime in C,

43:43.160 --> 43:45.760
 an unsafe language, and if you're reference counting

43:45.760 --> 43:48.080
 and you overflow the counter, you mismanage it

43:48.080 --> 43:49.640
 so it goes high, it gets stuck high,

43:49.640 --> 43:51.560
 you leak memory again and you run out.

43:51.560 --> 43:56.200
 If you underflow it, you pre memory that's still in use.

43:56.200 --> 44:00.120
 And even then we knew what all the security hackers

44:00.120 --> 44:03.000
 came to know that you therefore have potentially

44:03.000 --> 44:05.840
 a remote code execution vulnerability.

44:05.840 --> 44:09.800
 Cause this was before things like non executable

44:09.800 --> 44:14.800
 heap memory and staff defenses against taking over memory.

44:14.800 --> 44:17.780
 So if you can, from the remote side,

44:17.780 --> 44:19.920
 write some HTML and JavaScript that just happens

44:19.920 --> 44:21.820
 to exploit a bug in memory safety,

44:21.820 --> 44:24.960
 like it causes JavaScript to underflow reference counter.

44:24.960 --> 44:27.560
 And the script still has its hands on that object

44:27.560 --> 44:29.040
 and it's trying to call a method on it

44:29.040 --> 44:30.680
 and there's some kind of lookup function table

44:30.680 --> 44:34.600
 in the object, but you've managed to stuff the heap

44:34.600 --> 44:37.160
 with strings that forwards their own lookalike

44:37.160 --> 44:39.720
 for the function table.

44:39.720 --> 44:41.360
 You can call some other code.

44:41.360 --> 44:43.400
 And this was a problem right away.

44:43.400 --> 44:46.280
 So security, JavaScript upped the ante.

44:46.280 --> 44:48.840
 Java had this problem too, but in its own VM.

44:48.840 --> 44:53.440
 And it just was a separate headache for Sun to worry about.

44:53.440 --> 44:55.280
 We had this problem in Netscape right away.

44:55.280 --> 44:58.360
 So Netscape 2 came out after my 10 days

44:58.360 --> 45:02.640
 and after these follow on work to embed JavaScript

45:02.640 --> 45:04.480
 better in the browser and to add garbage

45:04.480 --> 45:05.960
 or collection through reference counting,

45:05.960 --> 45:09.640
 really I call it reference counting and get it shipped.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.400
 We had a bunch of dot releases where we fixed

45:11.400 --> 45:13.560
 security bugs like maniacs.

45:13.560 --> 45:16.200
 But what is the thing you're, you know,

45:16.200 --> 45:19.120
 when you sit back on a porch and just look out

45:19.120 --> 45:21.000
 into the sunset, what are you most proud of

45:21.000 --> 45:21.960
 from those 10 days?

45:21.960 --> 45:23.560
 I think the first class functions shines.

45:23.560 --> 45:25.600
 I think especially since Java didn't have it

45:25.600 --> 45:27.600
 and it was somewhat unusual.

45:27.600 --> 45:30.640
 Scheme made it in somehow at the end of the day.

45:30.640 --> 45:33.440
 In spirit, I mean, people complain because Scheme has,

45:33.440 --> 45:34.840
 you know, minimalism.

45:34.840 --> 45:37.000
 It has, you know, six or seven special forms.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.720
 It has hygienic macros.

45:38.720 --> 45:39.640
 It has call CC.

45:39.640 --> 45:44.640
 It has sort of a beautiful complete set of forms

45:44.880 --> 45:49.440
 to make the land of calculus pleasant to use in practice.

45:49.440 --> 45:54.120
 And JavaScript is, you know, kind of a multi paradigm

45:54.120 --> 45:55.200
 or shambolic.

45:55.200 --> 45:59.400
 Just in a small tangent, you mentioned Mark Andreessen.

45:59.400 --> 46:03.400
 It sounds like, and Bill Joy, but staying on Mark,

46:03.400 --> 46:06.520
 it sounds like he had an impact on you

46:06.520 --> 46:09.120
 in that he sort of believed in what you were doing there.

46:09.120 --> 46:11.920
 Can you talk about like what role Mark had in your life?

46:11.920 --> 46:15.880
 Yeah, we would meet at the Peninsula Creamery

46:15.880 --> 46:17.720
 in downtown Palo Alto.

46:17.720 --> 46:19.960
 And Mark was just fresh out of, you know, grad school

46:19.960 --> 46:22.720
 or whatever he was doing and he was big dude

46:22.720 --> 46:25.280
 and he got fitter later.

46:25.280 --> 46:28.800
 He had hair, he would order giant milkshakes and burgers

46:28.800 --> 46:31.040
 and we would meet there and brainstorm about what to do.

46:31.040 --> 46:34.280
 And it was very direct because we didn't have much time.

46:34.280 --> 46:36.400
 The sort of, we didn't talk about it.

46:36.400 --> 46:39.080
 The implication was Microsoft was coming after us.

46:39.080 --> 46:41.760
 Mark was saying things boldly pre IPO

46:41.760 --> 46:44.320
 like Netscape plus Java kills Windows, right?

46:44.320 --> 46:46.840
 This is, make a browser programmable.

46:46.840 --> 46:49.440
 It becomes the new runtime for programs.

46:49.440 --> 46:52.000
 It's the meta OS or it's the replacement OS.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.280
 But he still saw value in JavaScript.

46:54.280 --> 46:56.000
 Yes, even though he was saying that

46:56.000 --> 46:59.800
 and Java was the big name, hence the trademark license,

46:59.800 --> 47:01.360
 he saw JavaScript as important.

47:01.360 --> 47:03.720
 And he even thought, what if we got,

47:03.720 --> 47:05.040
 I told this in other interviews, I can say it.

47:05.040 --> 47:07.680
 He thought, what if we had my friend Kip Hickman

47:07.680 --> 47:09.560
 who'd been at Netscape from the beginning

47:09.560 --> 47:13.080
 and who was a kernel hacker at SGI when I joined,

47:13.080 --> 47:14.920
 he'd started writing his own JVM

47:14.920 --> 47:16.440
 before we consummated the Sun deal

47:16.440 --> 47:17.960
 and got our hands on their code.

47:17.960 --> 47:20.480
 And the Java compiler, Java C,

47:20.480 --> 47:23.200
 which Arthur Van Hoff had written very nice code,

47:23.200 --> 47:24.160
 was all written in Java.

47:24.160 --> 47:26.480
 It was self hosted or so called bootstrap.

47:26.480 --> 47:29.320
 And so we could use that as soon as Kip's Java VM

47:29.320 --> 47:34.400
 could run the bytecode from the Sun JVM

47:34.400 --> 47:37.520
 running the self hosted compiler to emit the bytecode.

47:37.520 --> 47:39.400
 So once we could bootstrap into Kip's VM,

47:39.400 --> 47:40.320
 we wouldn't need Sun.

47:40.320 --> 47:44.400
 And Mark was like, well, maybe we can just ditch Sun.

47:44.400 --> 47:47.360
 Well, if Kip's Java VM, or if you're a JavaScript VM,

47:47.360 --> 47:48.240
 now we need graphics.

47:48.240 --> 47:49.600
 So Mark was thinking far ahead

47:49.600 --> 47:53.380
 because he knew you could do things with HTML and images,

47:53.380 --> 47:54.920
 but at some point you really want.

47:54.920 --> 47:57.600
 Like dynamic graphics or three dimensional?

47:57.600 --> 47:59.920
 Even SGI had already started its downfall

47:59.920 --> 48:02.960
 because the first floor VLSI team there

48:02.960 --> 48:04.440
 had gone off to do 3D effects

48:04.440 --> 48:05.360
 and all these other companies

48:05.360 --> 48:07.520
 that made the graphics card on your PC, right?

48:07.520 --> 48:09.360
 Doom was big and Quake.

48:09.360 --> 48:10.680
 And so you were, we were all playing Quake.

48:10.680 --> 48:12.880
 I was old, so I was terrible.

48:12.880 --> 48:16.400
 But why not put that graphics capability on the web?

48:16.400 --> 48:18.720
 And in fact, it finally happened at Mozilla

48:18.720 --> 48:21.520
 with Firefox era with Vlad Vukicovic

48:21.520 --> 48:24.420
 taking OpenGL ES and reflecting it as WebGL.

48:24.420 --> 48:28.000
 But OpenGL ES is the mobile version of OpenGL,

48:28.000 --> 48:30.320
 which is a standard based on SGI GL.

48:30.320 --> 48:32.800
 So this whole lineage of graphics libraries

48:32.800 --> 48:36.280
 or really graphics languages for what became the GPU.

48:36.280 --> 48:37.320
 And Mark was thinking ahead.

48:37.320 --> 48:38.560
 He's like, we need graphics too.

48:38.560 --> 48:40.960
 And I thought, okay, I can try to get somebody I knew at SGI,

48:40.960 --> 48:42.880
 but he's a grad student at MIT.

48:42.880 --> 48:44.440
 He was studying under Barbara Liskov.

48:44.440 --> 48:46.780
 He laughed when he heard about this later, Andrew Myers.

48:46.780 --> 48:50.040
 He's at Cornell, long time, I think he's a full professor.

48:50.040 --> 48:52.200
 And Mark said, great, we'll get him.

48:52.200 --> 48:53.200
 I'm not sure he's gonna come.

48:53.200 --> 48:55.320
 We'll throw money, we'll stock options.

48:55.320 --> 48:56.160
 We never did it.

48:56.160 --> 48:57.640
 And they did the Sun deal.

48:57.640 --> 49:00.960
 So Kip Nobly put aside his own JVM

49:00.960 --> 49:02.880
 and we used the Sun JVM.

49:02.880 --> 49:04.000
 So that was an ambitious period.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.640
 And Mark was very generative because he was pushing hard.

49:06.640 --> 49:11.200
 He was ambitious and he wanted to have Netscape

49:11.200 --> 49:13.680
 possibly be in control of the ball.

49:13.680 --> 49:16.840
 Maybe you can speak to this dance

49:16.840 --> 49:20.440
 of Netscape versus Internet Explorer.

49:20.440 --> 49:25.440
 You've thrown some loving words towards Microsoft

49:25.600 --> 49:26.720
 throughout this conversation,

49:26.720 --> 49:29.080
 but that's a theme with, I mean, Steve Jobs

49:29.080 --> 49:31.280
 has a similar sort of commentary.

49:31.280 --> 49:34.520
 From a big sort of philosophical principle perspective,

49:34.520 --> 49:36.600
 can you comment on like the approach

49:36.600 --> 49:39.280
 that Microsoft has taken with Internet Explorer

49:39.280 --> 49:42.120
 from IE1 to Edge today?

49:42.120 --> 49:45.400
 Is there something that you see as valuable

49:45.400 --> 49:48.420
 that they're doing in the occasional copying

49:48.420 --> 49:49.600
 and that kind of stuff?

49:49.600 --> 49:53.360
 Or is it, is the world worse off

49:53.360 --> 49:55.240
 because Internet Explorer exists?

49:55.240 --> 49:57.640
 So I'm gonna segment this into historical areas

49:57.640 --> 49:59.560
 because I think Microsoft today with Satya

49:59.560 --> 50:00.640
 is quite a different company

50:00.640 --> 50:02.360
 and what they're doing with Edge is different.

50:02.360 --> 50:06.160
 But back then, Gates, aggressive character,

50:06.160 --> 50:09.680
 not really original in my view, not an originator.

50:09.680 --> 50:11.280
 Steve Jobs famously said once,

50:11.280 --> 50:12.440
 he doesn't have any taste

50:12.440 --> 50:15.080
 and I don't mean this in a small way, he has no taste.

50:15.080 --> 50:19.360
 You can see this, Apple at the time had beautiful typography

50:19.360 --> 50:22.600
 and ligatures and kerning and the fonts looked great.

50:22.600 --> 50:25.240
 And Windows had this sort of ugly system font

50:25.240 --> 50:26.920
 that was carefully aligned with Pixel

50:26.920 --> 50:28.640
 so it didn't get anything.

50:28.640 --> 50:29.480
 What is it?

50:29.480 --> 50:30.300
 I'm sorry to keep interrupting,

50:30.300 --> 50:32.360
 but why was Internet Explorer winning

50:32.360 --> 50:34.320
 throughout the history of these competitions?

50:34.320 --> 50:35.240
 Distribution.

50:35.240 --> 50:36.600
 Distribution matters more than anything.

50:36.600 --> 50:39.840
 And this is why even now we're seeing

50:39.840 --> 50:41.640
 in the browser wars Edge doing better

50:41.640 --> 50:43.440
 because it's being foisted on people of Windows.

50:43.440 --> 50:45.200
 We have Windows 10 boxes at home.

50:45.200 --> 50:48.240
 We have some Windows 7 boxes or laptops we keep running to

50:48.240 --> 50:50.840
 because we don't connect them to the internet generally.

50:50.840 --> 50:55.840
 But once you have that operating system to hold,

50:55.840 --> 50:57.800
 you can force Edge.

50:57.800 --> 50:59.480
 And Apple did it with Safari too.

50:59.480 --> 51:01.340
 It's not unique to Microsoft.

51:01.340 --> 51:02.180
 That's sad.

51:02.180 --> 51:03.680
 But distribution matters.

51:03.680 --> 51:07.080
 And that's why I think IE was going to win.

51:07.080 --> 51:09.560
 That's why everybody at Netscape felt we're doomed.

51:09.560 --> 51:12.900
 This was something Michael Toy and Jamie Woodson were doomed.

51:12.900 --> 51:14.720
 But for a while there we had a chance

51:14.720 --> 51:16.040
 and we innovated in Netscape too.

51:16.040 --> 51:18.860
 We did a big platform push, Java and JavaScript

51:18.860 --> 51:23.860
 and plugins, more plugins and more HTML table features.

51:23.860 --> 51:28.700
 And really started making a programmable stack

51:28.700 --> 51:30.820
 out of what were pretty static web languages.

51:30.820 --> 51:33.220
 And even in the beta releases of Netscape,

51:33.220 --> 51:34.460
 two people were using JavaScript

51:34.460 --> 51:36.620
 to build what you would call single page applications

51:36.620 --> 51:37.620
 like Gmail.

51:37.620 --> 51:40.380
 And they were using JavaScript locally to compute things

51:40.380 --> 51:43.660
 and to call the server on a hidden frame in the background.

51:43.660 --> 51:46.860
 So it was prefiguring a lot of what came later as AJAX

51:46.860 --> 51:48.580
 or dynamic JavaScript, dynamic HTML.

51:48.580 --> 51:49.740
 So people saw that, I mean.

51:49.740 --> 51:50.920
 Even then they saw it, yeah.

51:50.920 --> 51:52.900
 That's kind of, I don't know.

51:52.900 --> 51:55.180
 But from my perspective, that seems quite brilliant.

51:55.180 --> 51:56.580
 It seems like really innovative

51:56.580 --> 51:59.220
 that you would have code run in the browser.

51:59.220 --> 52:01.380
 It did impress me with something

52:01.380 --> 52:04.020
 which I learned later about from Eric Von Hippel of MIT,

52:04.020 --> 52:07.260
 which is user innovation networks, lead user effects.

52:07.260 --> 52:09.200
 That throwing out JavaScript,

52:09.200 --> 52:10.460
 even though we weren't doing open source,

52:10.460 --> 52:12.320
 we were doing beta releases early

52:12.320 --> 52:14.360
 and permissively with Netscape.

52:14.360 --> 52:17.180
 Getting early developer feedback, absolutely critical.

52:17.180 --> 52:18.020
 I loved it.

52:18.020 --> 52:19.140
 I did some of that with SGI

52:19.140 --> 52:20.260
 with some of the products I worked on,

52:20.260 --> 52:21.860
 but it really came to the fore in Netscape.

52:21.860 --> 52:23.780
 And that culminated in Mozilla

52:23.780 --> 52:25.740
 where you're dealing with developers all the time

52:25.740 --> 52:27.240
 and early adopters, lead users.

52:27.240 --> 52:29.840
 But the lead users helped improve JavaScript,

52:29.840 --> 52:31.580
 even in those last few betas

52:31.580 --> 52:32.660
 where I could hardly change things.

52:32.660 --> 52:34.580
 I was under pretty rigid change control.

52:34.580 --> 52:36.260
 So we're talking about just a small collection

52:36.260 --> 52:38.340
 of individuals that are just like upfront.

52:38.340 --> 52:39.420
 A guy named Bill Dorch.

52:39.420 --> 52:40.940
 You can find his work in the web archives,

52:40.940 --> 52:41.960
 still from 1996.

52:41.960 --> 52:43.300
 It's a single page application.

52:43.300 --> 52:46.340
 It's an artist gallery of mountain art.

52:46.340 --> 52:47.180
 He used JavaScript?

52:47.180 --> 52:48.000
 It doesn't quite work.

52:48.000 --> 52:48.840
 He uses JavaScript locally.

52:48.840 --> 52:50.580
 He uses a local database.

52:50.580 --> 52:52.180
 What you would think of now is JSON,

52:52.180 --> 52:54.260
 but it's all pure JavaScript code,

52:54.260 --> 52:55.820
 a bunch of objects being constructed.

52:55.820 --> 52:57.460
 That's so cool.

52:57.460 --> 53:02.460
 So how is, if you can do sort of a big sweeping progress

53:02.620 --> 53:05.380
 of JavaScript, how has JavaScript changed over the years?

53:05.380 --> 53:07.300
 Any of you from those early 10 days

53:07.300 --> 53:09.460
 with a quick addition of garbage collection

53:09.460 --> 53:11.140
 and fixes around security,

53:11.140 --> 53:14.500
 how has this evolution that now it's taken over the world?

53:14.500 --> 53:16.340
 In this, it's been a bumpy ride

53:16.340 --> 53:19.900
 because the standards body got shut down after Microsoft,

53:19.900 --> 53:22.580
 I think, took over the web and then felt punished

53:22.580 --> 53:25.360
 by the USB Microsoft antitrust case.

53:25.360 --> 53:27.380
 Can you speak to the standard body?

53:27.380 --> 53:28.260
 That was a fun ride too

53:28.260 --> 53:30.940
 because Netscape had taken the lead

53:30.940 --> 53:34.340
 with the web and HTML innovations

53:34.340 --> 53:36.900
 like frames and framesets tables.

53:36.900 --> 53:39.220
 And the W3C was sort of off even then,

53:39.220 --> 53:43.100
 sort of in SGML land heading toward XML, la la land.

53:43.100 --> 53:44.340
 I'm gonna be a little harsh on it.

53:44.340 --> 53:45.180
 What's SGML?

53:45.180 --> 53:46.000
 I'm sorry.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.900
 SGML was the precursor markup language to HTML.

53:48.900 --> 53:52.740
 It was sort of the more extensible standards,

53:52.740 --> 53:54.140
 generalized markup language.

53:54.140 --> 53:54.980
 It was a...

53:54.980 --> 53:55.820
 XML like...

53:55.820 --> 53:58.540
 Pointy brackets, but it had all sorts of elaborate syntax

53:58.540 --> 54:00.940
 for doing different semantics.

54:00.940 --> 54:03.780
 And this is why I think TBL and others

54:03.780 --> 54:08.320
 who wanted to do the semantic web then took XML forward,

54:08.320 --> 54:10.400
 but they had this, or some of them anyway,

54:10.400 --> 54:12.980
 had this strange idea they could replace the web with XML

54:12.980 --> 54:15.720
 or that they would upgrade the web to be XML.

54:15.720 --> 54:17.240
 And it couldn't be done.

54:17.240 --> 54:19.500
 Worse is better had concrete meaning.

54:19.500 --> 54:22.660
 The web was very forgiving of HTML,

54:22.660 --> 54:25.180
 including sort of minor syntax errors

54:25.180 --> 54:26.500
 that could be error corrected.

54:26.500 --> 54:28.140
 Like error correction isn't generally done

54:28.140 --> 54:29.980
 in programming languages because...

54:29.980 --> 54:32.540
 That's another amazing thing about HTML is like,

54:32.540 --> 54:35.140
 it's more like biology than programming.

54:35.140 --> 54:35.980
 Exactly.

54:35.980 --> 54:40.700
 And so XML was in its standard form super strict

54:40.700 --> 54:43.220
 and could never have admitted the kind of users

54:43.220 --> 54:44.420
 who were committing these errors.

54:44.420 --> 54:46.500
 And the funniest part was Microsoft said,

54:46.500 --> 54:47.620
 hey, we're doing XML,

54:47.620 --> 54:49.540
 but the way they put it in Internet Explorer

54:49.540 --> 54:51.500
 under the default media type,

54:51.500 --> 54:53.940
 put it through the HTML error corrector.

54:53.940 --> 54:54.940
 Oh, wow.

54:54.940 --> 54:57.020
 So they kind of bastardized it to make it popular

54:57.020 --> 54:58.580
 and usable and accessible.

54:58.580 --> 55:03.580
 And so XML as a pure thing was never gonna take over.

55:04.220 --> 55:07.140
 And what W3C was kind of not fully functional

55:07.140 --> 55:09.700
 because Netscape wasn't cooperating with them.

55:09.700 --> 55:11.100
 We thought about where to take JavaScript

55:11.100 --> 55:12.660
 and we realized our standards,

55:12.660 --> 55:17.140
 Guru Kargal realized there was a European standards body

55:17.140 --> 55:18.800
 that had already given Microsoft fits

55:18.800 --> 55:22.580
 by standardizing parts of the Windows 3.1 API,

55:22.580 --> 55:24.020
 which European governments insisted on.

55:24.020 --> 55:26.260
 They said, Microsoft, we can't use your operating system

55:26.260 --> 55:27.580
 without some standards.

55:27.580 --> 55:29.660
 And Microsoft said, here's our docs.

55:29.660 --> 55:32.460
 And the government said, no, we need a European standard.

55:32.460 --> 55:33.420
 So this body called

55:33.420 --> 55:37.500
 the European Computer Manufacturers Association, ECMA,

55:37.500 --> 55:38.620
 which eventually became global

55:38.620 --> 55:40.980
 and became a proper noun instead of an acronym.

55:40.980 --> 55:44.660
 Right, it's just one capital E now with a lowercase CMA.

55:44.660 --> 55:47.580
 Right, and as one of the early Microsoft guys I met

55:47.580 --> 55:50.260
 when we first convened a working group

55:50.260 --> 55:51.420
 to talk about JavaScript said,

55:51.420 --> 55:53.420
 it sounds like a skin disease.

55:53.420 --> 55:56.140
 But it gave, I mean, maybe you'll speak to that,

55:56.140 --> 55:58.980
 but it gave the name to JavaScript of ECMA script.

55:58.980 --> 55:59.820
 That was the standard name

55:59.820 --> 56:02.820
 because Java was a trademark of Suns.

56:02.820 --> 56:03.720
 They were so aggressive,

56:03.720 --> 56:05.840
 they were sending cease and desist letters

56:05.840 --> 56:08.500
 to people whose middle European heritage

56:08.500 --> 56:10.820
 meant their surname was Javanko

56:10.820 --> 56:12.900
 and they called their website javanko.com

56:12.900 --> 56:14.680
 and Sunwood sent them a letter saying,

56:14.680 --> 56:16.820
 you're using J A V A at the start of your domain name,

56:16.820 --> 56:18.940
 you must cease and desist.

56:18.940 --> 56:22.020
 I love marketing more than anything else in this world.

56:22.020 --> 56:27.020
 So ECMA script and now is popularly named as ES plus version.

56:27.420 --> 56:29.900
 I would say people use JS more than anything.

56:29.900 --> 56:31.140
 People still say JavaScript.

56:31.140 --> 56:32.460
 JavaScript is in all the books.

56:32.460 --> 56:33.740
 So I mean, when you're referring to it,

56:33.740 --> 56:34.900
 it's usually JavaScript.

56:34.900 --> 56:37.340
 And when you wanna refer to a version of JavaScript,

56:37.340 --> 56:39.180
 you'll say ES6, ES5.

56:39.180 --> 56:40.860
 Yes, or now they've gone to years,

56:40.860 --> 56:41.840
 which is kind of confusing

56:41.840 --> 56:46.840
 because it's an offset of 2009, ES6, ES 2016.

56:50.740 --> 56:52.700
 Yeah, it doesn't match the years perfectly.

56:52.700 --> 56:55.680
 Yeah, so what were the choices made

56:55.680 --> 56:58.020
 and how did JavaScript evolve here?

56:58.020 --> 57:01.100
 So we took this new standards body,

57:01.100 --> 57:04.340
 which we thought sort of a proven record

57:04.340 --> 57:05.420
 of standing up to Microsoft,

57:05.420 --> 57:07.540
 but Microsoft sent a lot of people.

57:07.540 --> 57:10.540
 They sent some people who were pretty good.

57:10.540 --> 57:12.940
 And then when they realized that I was there

57:12.940 --> 57:15.220
 and Netscape was not gonna just bend over

57:15.220 --> 57:16.380
 and do whatever they wanted,

57:16.380 --> 57:17.220
 they sent somebody really good.

57:17.220 --> 57:18.060
 And he was a smart guy.

57:18.060 --> 57:21.000
 He did a lot of the work on the first draft of the spec.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.780
 Sean Katzenberger, he's left Microsoft.

57:22.780 --> 57:25.280
 He even did what I sort of did.

57:25.280 --> 57:28.000
 He told his bosses, stop bugging me to do other things.

57:28.000 --> 57:28.960
 I'm focused on this.

57:28.960 --> 57:30.580
 Cause it took a lot of focused work

57:30.580 --> 57:31.940
 to create the first draft of the spec.

57:31.940 --> 57:33.560
 And I was still holding,

57:33.560 --> 57:34.900
 I was spending almost all the plates.

57:34.900 --> 57:37.220
 I had like part time help in certain areas.

57:37.220 --> 57:38.740
 And on the front end integrations,

57:38.740 --> 57:40.080
 I had the front end guys.

57:40.080 --> 57:42.620
 But I couldn't take as much time as Sean was

57:42.620 --> 57:43.680
 to write the draft spec,

57:43.680 --> 57:44.660
 but I had to participate

57:44.660 --> 57:46.880
 because I was essentially helping write down

57:46.880 --> 57:48.020
 what the language did

57:48.020 --> 57:50.180
 and in areas where we didn't like what it did

57:50.180 --> 57:51.620
 and Microsoft didn't agree,

57:51.620 --> 57:54.580
 we sometimes got away with slight changes.

57:54.580 --> 57:55.800
 And that's the story of standards.

57:55.800 --> 57:58.020
 You have different implementations

57:58.020 --> 57:59.840
 and depending on their market power,

57:59.840 --> 58:01.840
 they interoperate where you have agreement

58:01.840 --> 58:02.780
 and where they don't,

58:02.780 --> 58:05.900
 the dominant one usually sets the de facto standard.

58:05.900 --> 58:07.500
 And then you should probably reflect that

58:07.500 --> 58:09.340
 into the de jure standard.

58:09.340 --> 58:11.060
 And this happened with JavaScript.

58:11.060 --> 58:14.120
 Over time, as Netscape went down and Microsoft went up,

58:14.120 --> 58:18.180
 we did the first edition of the standard codified in 1997

58:18.180 --> 58:22.140
 in France, we had a trip to Nice, which was very memorable.

58:22.140 --> 58:24.540
 For any interesting reason or just because it's Nice?

58:24.540 --> 58:28.980
 And ECMA's European and IBM and others were there.

58:28.980 --> 58:31.340
 Mike Kalashaw, an IBM fellow was a British.

58:31.340 --> 58:35.260
 And the guy who ran ECMA at the time, Jan van der Bell,

58:35.260 --> 58:39.060
 was quite a raconteur and a very fun guy.

58:39.060 --> 58:41.220
 And he had us out for, you know, the great,

58:41.220 --> 58:43.480
 you know, Fui de mer, the bouillabaisse and the...

58:43.480 --> 58:46.140
 Was the standardization process beautiful or painful

58:46.140 --> 58:48.460
 that those early days, you as a designer of the language?

58:48.460 --> 58:50.140
 It was painful because it was rushed.

58:50.140 --> 58:52.400
 Now, Guy Steele was contributed by Sun.

58:52.400 --> 58:53.620
 So even more than Sean,

58:53.620 --> 58:55.960
 you had this giant brain Guy Steele helping,

58:55.960 --> 58:57.220
 bringing some of that scheme magic.

58:57.220 --> 58:59.460
 And he even brought Richard Gabriel for funding.

58:59.460 --> 59:02.900
 Richard wrote the fourth clause of the ECMA standard,

59:02.900 --> 59:05.300
 which was kind of an intro to what JavaScript's all about.

59:05.300 --> 59:07.260
 So we had some really good people

59:07.260 --> 59:09.140
 and we didn't fight too much.

59:09.140 --> 59:11.480
 There was some tension where I was fixing bugs

59:11.480 --> 59:13.860
 and I was late to a meeting and Sean Katzenberger,

59:13.860 --> 59:15.020
 Microsoft, was actually mad.

59:15.020 --> 59:15.840
 Like, where is he?

59:15.840 --> 59:16.680
 We need him.

59:16.680 --> 59:18.660
 And when I got there,

59:18.660 --> 59:21.940
 I saw that only he saw this sort of off by one bug

59:21.940 --> 59:22.960
 in somewhere in the spec.

59:22.960 --> 59:24.020
 And then I saw it too.

59:24.020 --> 59:25.300
 And I said, there's a fence post bug there.

59:25.300 --> 59:27.020
 And then we kind of locked eyes

59:27.020 --> 59:28.480
 and we realized we were on the same page.

59:28.480 --> 59:30.300
 And we kind of, he wasn't mad anymore.

59:30.300 --> 59:33.020
 What were the features that are being struggled over

59:33.020 --> 59:35.000
 and debated and thought about?

59:35.000 --> 59:36.480
 It was mainly writing down what worked

59:36.480 --> 59:38.420
 and what we thought should work in the edge cases

59:38.420 --> 59:41.540
 that didn't interoperate or that seemed wrong.

59:41.540 --> 59:43.080
 But we were already laying the groundwork

59:43.080 --> 59:46.220
 for the future additions that I was already implementing.

59:46.220 --> 59:48.120
 I was still trying to lead the standard

59:48.120 --> 59:50.100
 by using the dominant market power

59:50.100 --> 59:52.500
 to write the code that actually shipped.

59:52.500 --> 59:54.740
 So the de facto standard would lead the de jure standard.

59:54.740 --> 59:58.220
 And I was putting in the missing function forms

59:58.220 --> 1:00:00.520
 that I didn't have time for in the 10 days.

1:00:00.520 --> 1:00:03.500
 So this is the engineering mindset versus the theoretician.

1:00:03.500 --> 1:00:05.120
 So you didn't want to create the perfect language,

1:00:05.120 --> 1:00:06.940
 but one that was the popular and shipped

1:00:06.940 --> 1:00:07.780
 and all that kind of stuff.

1:00:07.780 --> 1:00:08.620
 And you could say there was,

1:00:08.620 --> 1:00:09.940
 I was standing on the shoulders of giants.

1:00:09.940 --> 1:00:11.220
 So there was a staged process

1:00:11.220 --> 1:00:12.820
 where I had to hold back things

1:00:12.820 --> 1:00:15.900
 that were well designed by others in other languages

1:00:15.900 --> 1:00:17.260
 and I could imitate,

1:00:17.260 --> 1:00:18.540
 but I couldn't do them all in the 10 days.

1:00:18.540 --> 1:00:22.820
 So they came in 1996 and 97,

1:00:22.820 --> 1:00:25.140
 and they came into the third edition of the standard,

1:00:25.140 --> 1:00:27.680
 which was final finalized in 1999.

1:00:27.680 --> 1:00:28.520
 But at that point,

1:00:28.520 --> 1:00:31.220
 Netscape had been sold to AOL

1:00:31.220 --> 1:00:33.140
 which was a decent exit considering

1:00:33.140 --> 1:00:37.380
 and had previously been mercilessly crushed.

1:00:37.380 --> 1:00:40.700
 Netscape was selling the browser along with server software

1:00:40.700 --> 1:00:42.740
 that it had acquired after its IPO

1:00:42.740 --> 1:00:44.560
 and Microsoft was just underpricing it.

1:00:44.560 --> 1:00:47.500
 So there was no way to compete with that.

1:00:47.500 --> 1:00:51.420
 Microsoft was also making Internet Explorer

1:00:51.420 --> 1:00:53.140
 the default browser in Windows,

1:00:53.140 --> 1:00:55.580
 which is called tying and antitrust law.

1:00:55.580 --> 1:00:57.140
 And they were doing even more brutal things.

1:00:57.140 --> 1:00:59.260
 There was a famous investor.

1:00:59.260 --> 1:01:00.340
 He did very well on Google.

1:01:00.340 --> 1:01:01.780
 So he's a billionaire, Ramshree Ram,

1:01:01.780 --> 1:01:04.700
 and he was sales guy or head of sales at Netscape.

1:01:04.700 --> 1:01:07.920
 And he got off the phone looking ashen faced

1:01:07.920 --> 1:01:09.620
 after a compact called and said,

1:01:10.540 --> 1:01:12.060
 Microsoft just told us they're gonna pull

1:01:12.060 --> 1:01:13.860
 our Windows license if we ship Netscape

1:01:13.860 --> 1:01:15.100
 as the default browser.

1:01:15.100 --> 1:01:15.940
 Wow.

1:01:15.940 --> 1:01:17.460
 So there is some bullying going on.

1:01:17.460 --> 1:01:19.720
 It was totally immaterial in the antitrust case.

1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:23.060
 But JavaScript escaped into the standard setting

1:01:23.060 --> 1:01:24.900
 where there was fairly good cooperation.

1:01:24.900 --> 1:01:26.860
 Microsoft had a really good guy on it

1:01:26.860 --> 1:01:29.420
 and Guy Steele was there for a time

1:01:29.420 --> 1:01:30.900
 and there was some good work.

1:01:30.900 --> 1:01:33.460
 But after the antitrust case

1:01:33.460 --> 1:01:37.500
 and Netscape kind of dissolving into AOL

1:01:37.500 --> 1:01:38.940
 and not really going anywhere quickly,

1:01:38.940 --> 1:01:40.960
 Mozilla took years to really bring up,

1:01:42.380 --> 1:01:43.400
 the standard froze.

1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:46.300
 And by 2003, even though they'd been sort of noodling around

1:01:46.300 --> 1:01:48.900
 with advanced versions, JavaScript 2,

1:01:48.900 --> 1:01:50.300
 I'd given the keys to the kingdom

1:01:50.300 --> 1:01:53.060
 to another MIT grad, Baltimore Horwatt.

1:01:53.060 --> 1:01:54.860
 Very big brain and still at Google, I think.

1:01:54.860 --> 1:01:56.700
 He won the Putnam in 86

1:01:56.700 --> 1:01:58.380
 and he's very mathematical.

1:01:58.380 --> 1:01:59.640
 Legit.

1:01:59.640 --> 1:02:02.980
 He designed this successor language, JavaScript 2,

1:02:02.980 --> 1:02:06.620
 but it only showed up in mutated form

1:02:06.620 --> 1:02:09.560
 in Microsoft's ASP.NET server side

1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:11.100
 and it didn't last there.

1:02:11.100 --> 1:02:12.340
 And it showed up in Flash

1:02:12.340 --> 1:02:14.220
 and that's what became ActionScript 3.

1:02:14.220 --> 1:02:16.860
 Ah, ActionScript, interesting.

1:02:16.860 --> 1:02:18.740
 And then Flash of course declined.

1:02:18.740 --> 1:02:21.300
 And so how did we arrive at ES6

1:02:21.300 --> 1:02:24.120
 where it's like there's so many,

1:02:24.120 --> 1:02:27.220
 where everyone, okay, there's this history of JavaScript

1:02:27.220 --> 1:02:29.220
 that people were, it was just like cool

1:02:29.220 --> 1:02:32.540
 when you're like having beers to talk crap about JavaScript.

1:02:32.540 --> 1:02:33.900
 Everyone loves to hate,

1:02:33.900 --> 1:02:36.460
 like people who are married say, ah, marriage sucks,

1:02:36.460 --> 1:02:38.900
 is they just wanna get, let off some steam

1:02:38.900 --> 1:02:40.900
 even though everyone uses the language.

1:02:40.900 --> 1:02:45.900
 But ES6, it's become this like reputable,

1:02:45.940 --> 1:02:49.180
 like it fixed major pain points, I think.

1:02:49.180 --> 1:02:50.420
 It added things to the language

1:02:50.420 --> 1:02:53.580
 and added something that was already ES5 strict mode,

1:02:53.580 --> 1:02:57.260
 but made it implicit in class bodies and module bodies.

1:02:57.260 --> 1:02:58.500
 It was a big jump,

1:02:58.500 --> 1:03:01.300
 but it accumulated some of the ES4 designs

1:03:01.300 --> 1:03:03.640
 that we'd done with Adobe

1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:07.660
 for what we hoped would be the fourth edition of ECMAScript

1:03:07.660 --> 1:03:10.740
 that were supposed to fold in some of these old JavaScript 2

1:03:10.740 --> 1:03:13.060
 ideas that had come into ActionScript 3.

1:03:13.060 --> 1:03:15.220
 So you look at the family tree and you see these forks

1:03:15.220 --> 1:03:20.220
 and the main ones are the ones that go into Adobe Flash

1:03:20.700 --> 1:03:21.900
 acquired from Macromedia

1:03:21.900 --> 1:03:23.580
 and the one that went into the service side

1:03:23.580 --> 1:03:26.040
 of Microsoft's stack, which kind of died.

1:03:27.100 --> 1:03:28.900
 And then trying to bring them back into the standard

1:03:28.900 --> 1:03:32.300
 and not quite succeeding, ES4 was mothballed,

1:03:32.300 --> 1:03:35.700
 but all the good parts that everyone liked made it into ES6.

1:03:35.700 --> 1:03:37.060
 And so that was a success.

1:03:37.060 --> 1:03:38.380
 And I said earlier, I had the wrong year,

1:03:38.380 --> 1:03:40.380
 I think it's 2015, so it's off by.

1:03:40.380 --> 1:03:42.420
 Four, ES6.

1:03:42.420 --> 1:03:44.300
 Yeah, it was finalized in 2015.

1:03:44.300 --> 1:03:45.620
 It took a little longer than we hoped,

1:03:45.620 --> 1:03:48.580
 but because ES5 was 2009

1:03:48.580 --> 1:03:51.580
 and that was a smaller increment from ES3.

1:03:51.580 --> 1:03:53.500
 We skipped four again, we mothballed it.

1:03:53.500 --> 1:03:56.620
 And we had a split in the committee where some people said,

1:03:56.620 --> 1:03:59.540
 ES4 is too big, we're gonna work on incremental improvements,

1:03:59.540 --> 1:04:02.580
 no new syntax in particular, they promised.

1:04:02.580 --> 1:04:06.300
 Not quite true, but they added a bunch of interesting APIs,

1:04:06.300 --> 1:04:09.880
 Alan Wiersbrock, my coauthor of the Hobble paper.

1:04:09.880 --> 1:04:11.140
 And he was at Microsoft at the time.

1:04:11.140 --> 1:04:12.300
 I ended up hiring with Mozilla.

1:04:12.300 --> 1:04:15.220
 He wanted to get to Mozilla and keep doing

1:04:16.620 --> 1:04:19.660
 his sort of editor job of the JavaScript standard,

1:04:19.660 --> 1:04:21.300
 ECMAScript.

1:04:21.300 --> 1:04:25.660
 And when we got ES6 done, it was a little late, 2015,

1:04:25.660 --> 1:04:27.180
 and we switched to year numbers.

1:04:27.180 --> 1:04:30.100
 So people still call it ES6, I call it ES6.

1:04:30.100 --> 1:04:33.100
 But if you remember, off by nine plus 2000.

1:04:33.100 --> 1:04:35.780
 Yeah, I mean, ES6 is such a big job.

1:04:35.780 --> 1:04:38.300
 I mean, like you said, there's a third that connects all of it,

1:04:38.300 --> 1:04:41.100
 but ES6 is when it became this language

1:04:41.100 --> 1:04:45.180
 that almost feels ready to take over the world completely.

1:04:45.180 --> 1:04:46.660
 More programming and the large features,

1:04:46.660 --> 1:04:49.380
 more features you need for larger teams.

1:04:49.380 --> 1:04:50.300
 Software engineering.

1:04:50.300 --> 1:04:52.220
 Microsoft did something smart, too.

1:04:52.220 --> 1:04:56.220
 Anders and company, Luke Hoban, who's left Microsoft,

1:04:56.220 --> 1:04:57.800
 also did TypeScript.

1:04:57.800 --> 1:05:00.400
 And they realized something, I think,

1:05:00.400 --> 1:05:02.760
 that Gilad Barak has also popularized,

1:05:02.760 --> 1:05:05.740
 and he was involved in Dart at Google.

1:05:05.740 --> 1:05:08.860
 If you, don't worry about soundness in the type system.

1:05:08.860 --> 1:05:10.920
 You don't try to enforce the type checks

1:05:10.920 --> 1:05:11.860
 at runtime in particular.

1:05:11.860 --> 1:05:13.460
 Just use it as sort of a warning system,

1:05:13.460 --> 1:05:15.020
 a tool time type system.

1:05:15.020 --> 1:05:17.660
 You can still have a lot of value for developers,

1:05:17.660 --> 1:05:19.260
 especially in large projects.

1:05:19.260 --> 1:05:21.260
 So TypeScript's been a roaring success for Microsoft.

1:05:21.260 --> 1:05:24.100
 What do you think about TypeScript?

1:05:24.100 --> 1:05:27.380
 Is it adding confusion, or is it ultimately beneficial?

1:05:27.380 --> 1:05:28.220
 I think it's beneficial.

1:05:28.220 --> 1:05:30.920
 Now, it's technically a superset of JavaScript,

1:05:30.920 --> 1:05:33.380
 so of course I love it, right?

1:05:33.380 --> 1:05:35.540
 The shortest JavaScript program

1:05:35.540 --> 1:05:36.660
 is still a TypeScript program.

1:05:36.660 --> 1:05:38.540
 Any JavaScript program is a TypeScript program,

1:05:38.540 --> 1:05:39.380
 which is brilliant,

1:05:39.380 --> 1:05:40.860
 because then you can start incrementally adding

1:05:40.860 --> 1:05:43.020
 type annotations, getting warnings,

1:05:43.020 --> 1:05:44.420
 learning how to use them.

1:05:44.420 --> 1:05:47.180
 Microsoft's had to kind of look around corners

1:05:47.180 --> 1:05:50.780
 at the standards body and guess how their version of modules

1:05:50.780 --> 1:05:52.500
 or decorators should work.

1:05:52.500 --> 1:05:55.380
 And the standards body then may change things a bit.

1:05:55.380 --> 1:05:57.620
 So I think they're obligated with TypeScript

1:05:57.620 --> 1:05:59.340
 either to carry their own version

1:05:59.340 --> 1:06:01.680
 or to bring it back with incompatible changes

1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:03.100
 towards the standard over time.

1:06:03.100 --> 1:06:05.420
 And I think they've played generally fair there.

1:06:05.420 --> 1:06:06.460
 There's some sentiment that,

1:06:06.460 --> 1:06:07.980
 why don't they standardize TypeScript?

1:06:07.980 --> 1:06:09.920
 Well, they've been clear they don't want to.

1:06:09.920 --> 1:06:11.880
 They have a proprietary investment, it's valuable.

1:06:11.880 --> 1:06:13.420
 They have control of the ball.

1:06:13.420 --> 1:06:15.820
 And in some ways, you can say the same thing

1:06:15.820 --> 1:06:18.100
 to any of the other big companies in the standards body.

1:06:18.100 --> 1:06:20.580
 Why doesn't Google standardize its stuff?

1:06:20.580 --> 1:06:22.260
 So you think it'll continue being

1:06:22.260 --> 1:06:24.620
 like a kind of dance partner to JavaScript,

1:06:24.620 --> 1:06:25.860
 to the base JavaScript?

1:06:25.860 --> 1:06:27.620
 There's a hope that at some point,

1:06:27.620 --> 1:06:29.740
 if they keep reconverging it and the standard

1:06:29.740 --> 1:06:32.020
 doesn't break them and goes in a good direction,

1:06:32.020 --> 1:06:34.780
 we will get at least the annotation syntax

1:06:34.780 --> 1:06:37.020
 and some semantics around them.

1:06:37.020 --> 1:06:39.020
 Because when you're talking about type annotations,

1:06:39.020 --> 1:06:42.340
 they're generally on parameters and return values

1:06:42.340 --> 1:06:43.940
 and variable declarations.

1:06:43.940 --> 1:06:45.540
 They're cast operators.

1:06:45.540 --> 1:06:47.260
 You want that syntax to be reserved

1:06:47.260 --> 1:06:49.980
 and you want it to work the same in all engines.

1:06:49.980 --> 1:06:51.540
 And this is where ideas like Gilad's

1:06:51.540 --> 1:06:54.240
 pluggable type systems might be good,

1:06:54.240 --> 1:06:55.820
 though then you could create the same problem

1:06:55.820 --> 1:06:56.960
 you have with Lisp and Scheme,

1:06:56.960 --> 1:06:58.540
 where there's a bunch of macro libraries

1:06:58.540 --> 1:07:01.700
 and they don't agree and you have conflicts between them.

1:07:01.700 --> 1:07:04.940
 But pluggable type systems could be one way to standardize.

1:07:04.940 --> 1:07:07.060
 What do you think about the giant ecosystem

1:07:07.060 --> 1:07:09.820
 of frameworks in JavaScript?

1:07:09.820 --> 1:07:12.860
 It feels like, because, I mean,

1:07:12.860 --> 1:07:16.060
 this is a side effect of how many people use JavaScript,

1:07:16.060 --> 1:07:19.220
 a lot of entrepreneurial spirit

1:07:19.220 --> 1:07:22.300
 create their own JavaScript frameworks

1:07:22.300 --> 1:07:27.260
 and they're actually awesome in all different ways.

1:07:27.260 --> 1:07:31.220
 And this is an interesting question

1:07:31.220 --> 1:07:33.180
 about almost like philosophically

1:07:33.180 --> 1:07:35.260
 about biological system and evolution,

1:07:35.260 --> 1:07:36.140
 all that kind of stuff.

1:07:36.140 --> 1:07:38.600
 Do you see that as good or should it like,

1:07:38.600 --> 1:07:40.380
 should some of them die out quicker?

1:07:40.380 --> 1:07:44.480
 I think maybe they should, now jQuery was a very clever

1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:45.980
 thing, John Resig made this library

1:07:45.980 --> 1:07:47.600
 that was sort of query and do

1:07:47.600 --> 1:07:49.980
 and blended sort of CSS selector syntax

1:07:49.980 --> 1:07:53.020
 with JavaScript sort of object graph or DOM querying

1:07:53.020 --> 1:07:54.940
 and made it very easy for people to do things

1:07:54.940 --> 1:07:57.660
 almost like they were learning jQuery as its own language,

1:07:57.660 --> 1:07:58.980
 domain specific language.

1:07:58.980 --> 1:08:03.220
 And that I think reflected in part the difficulty

1:08:03.220 --> 1:08:04.960
 of using the document object model,

1:08:04.960 --> 1:08:07.020
 these APIs that were originally designed in the 90s

1:08:07.020 --> 1:08:08.460
 for Java as well as JavaScript.

1:08:08.460 --> 1:08:11.740
 They're very object oriented or even procedural.

1:08:11.740 --> 1:08:13.360
 They're very kind of verbose.

1:08:13.360 --> 1:08:15.420
 And it took like a constructor call

1:08:15.420 --> 1:08:17.820
 and three different, you know, hokey pokey dances

1:08:17.820 --> 1:08:20.500
 to do something where as in jQuery, it's just one line.

1:08:20.500 --> 1:08:24.500
 Right, so that fed back finally into the standards.

1:08:24.500 --> 1:08:25.940
 It didn't mean we standardized jQuery.

1:08:25.940 --> 1:08:27.140
 It wasn't quite that concise,

1:08:27.140 --> 1:08:29.660
 but you find now with the modern standards

1:08:29.660 --> 1:08:34.660
 that we were working on in the HTML5 sort of effort

1:08:34.780 --> 1:08:37.100
 that things became simpler, the fetch API

1:08:37.100 --> 1:08:40.140
 and the query selector API, document.querySelector.

1:08:40.140 --> 1:08:42.540
 A lot of things can be done now in raw JavaScript

1:08:42.540 --> 1:08:46.660
 that you would make more concise and terse in jQuery,

1:08:46.660 --> 1:08:47.980
 but it's not bad.

1:08:47.980 --> 1:08:48.820
 It's pretty good.

1:08:48.820 --> 1:08:51.100
 Whereas in the old DOM of 15 years ago,

1:08:51.100 --> 1:08:51.940
 it was just too verbose.

1:08:51.940 --> 1:08:55.560
 So maybe the frameworks were born kind of

1:08:55.560 --> 1:08:59.020
 because JavaScript lacks some of the features of jQuery.

1:08:59.020 --> 1:09:02.700
 And so like now that JavaScript is swallowing

1:09:02.700 --> 1:09:05.220
 what jQuery was, then the frameworks will,

1:09:05.220 --> 1:09:07.840
 only the ones that truly add value will stick around

1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:08.980
 and the other ones will die out.

1:09:08.980 --> 1:09:10.700
 And that highlights this also this division

1:09:10.700 --> 1:09:12.300
 between the core language JavaScript,

1:09:12.300 --> 1:09:13.580
 which can show up in other places

1:09:13.580 --> 1:09:15.680
 like Node.js on the server side

1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:17.660
 and the browser specific APIs

1:09:17.660 --> 1:09:19.720
 or the document object model APIs,

1:09:19.720 --> 1:09:21.580
 which are even managed by the W3C,

1:09:21.580 --> 1:09:24.460
 the standards body that was off in XML La La Land

1:09:24.460 --> 1:09:26.940
 when we were doing real JavaScript standards in ECMA.

1:09:26.940 --> 1:09:30.260
 And you have this division of labor,

1:09:30.260 --> 1:09:33.260
 division of responsibility and division of style

1:09:33.260 --> 1:09:37.260
 and sort of aesthetics and also speed.

1:09:37.260 --> 1:09:39.620
 So the document object model really stagnated

1:09:39.620 --> 1:09:43.580
 after Microsoft kind of deinvested in the web.

1:09:43.580 --> 1:09:45.860
 And Microsoft did something in their haste

1:09:45.860 --> 1:09:46.900
 in the spirit of Netscape,

1:09:46.900 --> 1:09:49.780
 doing things quickly and getting on first called DHTML.

1:09:49.780 --> 1:09:51.340
 And some of their innovations

1:09:51.340 --> 1:09:53.700
 that were like an alternative document object model

1:09:53.700 --> 1:09:56.860
 didn't really get standardized until HTML5

1:09:56.860 --> 1:10:00.020
 when we pragmatists at Opera at the time,

1:10:00.020 --> 1:10:01.720
 Ian Hickson who went to Google,

1:10:01.720 --> 1:10:05.100
 Apple and Mozilla said let's,

1:10:05.100 --> 1:10:08.700
 XML is not gonna replace HTML, HTML4 is too old.

1:10:08.700 --> 1:10:12.140
 Let's standardize HTML5 based on all this good stuff

1:10:12.140 --> 1:10:14.900
 including that DHTML variant dynamic HTML5.

1:10:14.900 --> 1:10:18.140
 HTML5, it feels like to me, maybe you can correct me,

1:10:18.140 --> 1:10:21.140
 like a beautiful piece of design work.

1:10:21.140 --> 1:10:24.860
 It was, it's not often with web stuff,

1:10:24.860 --> 1:10:27.320
 you have this breath of just like,

1:10:27.320 --> 1:10:31.740
 oh, whoever did this is, it just feels good.

1:10:31.740 --> 1:10:33.660
 Is that, what are your thoughts about HTML?

1:10:33.660 --> 1:10:35.860
 Is the, am I being too romantic?

1:10:35.860 --> 1:10:36.780
 A little bit, a little bit.

1:10:36.780 --> 1:10:38.660
 Are there flaws, fundamental flaws to it

1:10:38.660 --> 1:10:40.180
 that I'm just not aware of?

1:10:40.180 --> 1:10:42.540
 My old friend Hixie did a great job.

1:10:42.540 --> 1:10:45.660
 He was another renegade physics student.

1:10:45.660 --> 1:10:47.980
 And he was basically a QA guy at Opera

1:10:47.980 --> 1:10:52.500
 but he obviously trained physics student

1:10:52.500 --> 1:10:54.620
 and someone who could write British

1:10:54.620 --> 1:10:57.820
 or he developed test suites

1:10:57.820 --> 1:11:00.920
 and he started thinking about them more axiomatically.

1:11:00.920 --> 1:11:02.520
 Now this is, this can be good

1:11:02.520 --> 1:11:03.980
 because you can sort of systematize

1:11:03.980 --> 1:11:06.020
 in a way that makes a better HTML

1:11:06.020 --> 1:11:08.100
 or you can get caught in the pragmatism of saying,

1:11:08.100 --> 1:11:09.820
 well, we have to handle all of these edge cases

1:11:09.820 --> 1:11:12.580
 so we're just gonna have sort of a test matrix.

1:11:12.580 --> 1:11:13.980
 And if the matrix is large,

1:11:13.980 --> 1:11:15.860
 it will not be beautiful by many people's lights.

1:11:15.860 --> 1:11:19.340
 Everyone likes to minimize along their preferred dimensions,

1:11:19.340 --> 1:11:21.660
 the seven special forms and scheme or whatever.

1:11:21.660 --> 1:11:26.660
 But reality is HTML needs to be big.

1:11:27.140 --> 1:11:30.400
 It's kind of shambolic, it's a creative multi paradigm.

1:11:30.400 --> 1:11:34.380
 And Hixie did a good job, I would say, with a bunch of it.

1:11:34.380 --> 1:11:36.620
 Other people came in in the spirit of Ian Hickson

1:11:36.620 --> 1:11:40.260
 to do HTML5 work and they've carried on that effort.

1:11:40.260 --> 1:11:42.820
 And so it's a mix of pragmatism,

1:11:42.820 --> 1:11:46.280
 de facto standards from the past being sort of combined

1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:47.580
 or written down for the first time

1:11:47.580 --> 1:11:50.300
 and then rethought in a way that has a simpler syntax,

1:11:50.300 --> 1:11:54.420
 like the fetch API instead of XML HTTP request.

1:11:54.420 --> 1:11:56.540
 This video too as well, it ultimately,

1:11:56.540 --> 1:11:58.100
 it feels like maybe you can correct me,

1:11:58.100 --> 1:12:01.180
 it feels like it was the nail in the coffin of Flash.

1:12:01.180 --> 1:12:03.020
 Steve Jobs saying no Flash on the iPhone,

1:12:03.020 --> 1:12:05.460
 in my opinion, was the actual sting through the heart.

1:12:05.460 --> 1:12:09.140
 But, well, I'm not sure what trope you wanna use.

1:12:09.140 --> 1:12:12.060
 Flash was a zombie until just this year, right?

1:12:12.060 --> 1:12:13.300
 Or last year, I think last year

1:12:13.300 --> 1:12:15.260
 was the end of Flash in main browsers.

1:12:16.380 --> 1:12:18.280
 But Jobs really did the death blow.

1:12:18.280 --> 1:12:23.020
 And yeah, you're right, we had to make HTML5 competitive.

1:12:23.020 --> 1:12:23.900
 I still don't think we got

1:12:23.900 --> 1:12:26.780
 that beautiful timeline animation.

1:12:26.780 --> 1:12:28.620
 The timeline thing, so you like the time.

1:12:28.620 --> 1:12:31.180
 I mean, me from, I used to animate

1:12:31.180 --> 1:12:32.780
 all kinds of stuff inside Flash,

1:12:32.780 --> 1:12:34.940
 plus there's a programming element.

1:12:34.940 --> 1:12:38.440
 It was a little bit, I don't know if you can comment on that,

1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:40.780
 but to me, it was a little bit like go to statement,

1:12:40.780 --> 1:12:44.900
 like in a sense that it was a little bit too chaotic.

1:12:44.900 --> 1:12:48.380
 Like it didn't, that OCD part of me as a programmer

1:12:48.380 --> 1:12:50.180
 wasn't satisfied by Flash.

1:12:50.180 --> 1:12:52.760
 It feels like there was bugs that were introduced

1:12:52.760 --> 1:12:55.340
 through the animation process that I couldn't debug easily.

1:12:55.340 --> 1:12:56.620
 Yes, I heard that too.

1:12:56.620 --> 1:12:57.460
 I didn't use it,

1:12:57.460 --> 1:12:59.820
 so I'm doing the grass is greener thing here.

1:12:59.820 --> 1:13:02.100
 The thing I liked about the animation model

1:13:02.100 --> 1:13:03.900
 was that it was this immutable function of time.

1:13:03.900 --> 1:13:06.220
 So you could time warp and you could,

1:13:06.220 --> 1:13:08.320
 if you dodged these bugs or worked carefully,

1:13:08.320 --> 1:13:09.900
 you could really make it sing in ways

1:13:09.900 --> 1:13:11.700
 that I think still a little challenging

1:13:11.700 --> 1:13:14.620
 with the web animation standards.

1:13:14.620 --> 1:13:18.140
 But, or just using raw canvas and WebGL.

1:13:18.140 --> 1:13:20.740
 But there's so many tools now that maybe it doesn't matter.

1:13:20.740 --> 1:13:23.980
 And yet we had to do video,

1:13:23.980 --> 1:13:27.820
 we had to do WebGL and then evolve it.

1:13:27.820 --> 1:13:29.160
 We had to do web audio.

1:13:30.060 --> 1:13:34.140
 But once we did all these things that helped Flash die,

1:13:34.140 --> 1:13:35.700
 thanks to Steve Gubbs,

1:13:35.700 --> 1:13:39.580
 we had something that people didn't realize.

1:13:39.580 --> 1:13:41.180
 We had that vision that Market Vision had,

1:13:41.180 --> 1:13:46.180
 this graphics capable to the metal portable runtime.

1:13:46.620 --> 1:13:49.360
 And we at Mozilla realized this

1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:52.420
 and we saw JavaScript was something

1:13:52.420 --> 1:13:53.340
 that you could compile to.

1:13:53.340 --> 1:13:55.620
 Adobe had somebody in the Adobe Labs doing this too.

1:13:55.620 --> 1:13:57.220
 He had a project called Alchemy.

1:13:57.220 --> 1:13:58.920
 We had somebody who's now Google,

1:13:59.820 --> 1:14:03.260
 Alon Zakai, who did his own LLVM based compiler

1:14:03.260 --> 1:14:06.140
 that would take C or C++ and it would emit JavaScript.

1:14:06.140 --> 1:14:07.660
 And you would think this is crazy.

1:14:07.660 --> 1:14:09.820
 You're going from this sort of machine types,

1:14:09.820 --> 1:14:13.100
 low level, controlled memory allocation language

1:14:13.100 --> 1:14:16.380
 to this garbage collected, dynamically typed,

1:14:16.380 --> 1:14:18.060
 high level, higher level language.

1:14:18.060 --> 1:14:22.460
 But Alon sort of just phenomenologically carved nature

1:14:22.460 --> 1:14:23.740
 of the joint and found the forms

1:14:23.740 --> 1:14:25.380
 that were fast in JavaScript.

1:14:25.380 --> 1:14:27.300
 And then with Dave Herman,

1:14:27.300 --> 1:14:29.580
 who I'd recruited from Northeastern University,

1:14:29.580 --> 1:14:31.280
 who was a type theorist,

1:14:31.280 --> 1:14:33.840
 and Luke Wagner, who's still at Mozilla,

1:14:33.840 --> 1:14:36.860
 who was the compiler guy and the JIT guy,

1:14:36.860 --> 1:14:40.240
 they figured out how to codify what Alon had done

1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:44.320
 into a typed subset of JavaScript called Asm.js.

1:14:44.320 --> 1:14:45.700
 And this is a strange thing to think about

1:14:45.700 --> 1:14:47.320
 because it doesn't have new syntax.

1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:52.320
 The types are casts that occur in dominator positions

1:14:52.780 --> 1:14:54.180
 in the control flow graph.

1:14:54.180 --> 1:14:56.740
 So it's like a hack on JavaScript and it's a subset

1:14:56.740 --> 1:14:58.380
 and it uses those bitwise operators

1:14:58.380 --> 1:15:00.420
 that I talked about copying from Java

1:15:00.420 --> 1:15:04.500
 to basically cast numeric types,

1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:06.940
 which are double position flowing point, into integers.

1:15:06.940 --> 1:15:10.600
 And so inside JavaScript, in the kernel semantics,

1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:11.700
 are integers.

1:15:11.700 --> 1:15:13.040
 And if you use these operators,

1:15:13.040 --> 1:15:15.600
 if a compiler emits them in the right places,

1:15:15.600 --> 1:15:18.500
 you can then treat them as typed values,

1:15:18.500 --> 1:15:22.380
 typed memory locations, and you can type check your program.

1:15:22.380 --> 1:15:24.940
 You can not only type check it, you can compile it.

1:15:24.940 --> 1:15:27.480
 And this is all in sort of linear time, Alon.

1:15:27.480 --> 1:15:30.420
 You can compile it to have deterministic performance.

1:15:30.420 --> 1:15:32.580
 It doesn't touch the garbage collector.

1:15:32.580 --> 1:15:35.500
 It calls a bunch of functions that come from the C functions

1:15:35.500 --> 1:15:37.500
 or C++ code that you're compiling.

1:15:37.500 --> 1:15:40.980
 And you can make the Epic Unreal Engine

1:15:40.980 --> 1:15:43.620
 go in 30 frames a second.

1:15:43.620 --> 1:15:46.900
 And when we did this in 2013 in the fall,

1:15:46.900 --> 1:15:50.180
 Tim Sweeney and I didn't think it could be done quickly.

1:15:50.180 --> 1:15:51.580
 Thought it would take years.

1:15:51.580 --> 1:15:54.100
 And the team went to Raleigh, to Epic,

1:15:54.100 --> 1:15:57.460
 and in four days they had Unreal Engine ported

1:15:57.460 --> 1:15:59.980
 by pressing a compile button.

1:15:59.980 --> 1:16:01.700
 But they had to have WebGL,

1:16:01.700 --> 1:16:03.220
 which came from OpenGL.

1:16:03.220 --> 1:16:06.020
 Yes, it came to OpenGL, which came from Silicon Graphics GL.

1:16:06.020 --> 1:16:09.460
 They had to have Web Audio so they could map OpenAL,

1:16:09.460 --> 1:16:11.740
 which was another audio library standard to Web Audio,

1:16:11.740 --> 1:16:14.940
 which was kind of a Chrome idiosyncratic thing.

1:16:14.940 --> 1:16:16.300
 But they could make it work.

1:16:16.300 --> 1:16:21.100
 And they had to have Asm.js for fast C++ to JavaScript.

1:16:21.100 --> 1:16:25.260
 And if you didn't have that fast compiler step,

1:16:25.260 --> 1:16:27.380
 the JavaScript you'd write by hand

1:16:27.380 --> 1:16:29.820
 trying to do an Unreal game would be too big and too slow.

1:16:29.820 --> 1:16:31.420
 It would touch the garbage collector.

1:16:31.420 --> 1:16:33.220
 It would not keep up with 30 frames a second

1:16:33.220 --> 1:16:35.580
 on the hardware, 2013 hardware.

1:16:35.580 --> 1:16:37.020
 So we demoed that at,

1:16:38.540 --> 1:16:40.420
 this must have been fall 2012 now that I think about it.

1:16:40.420 --> 1:16:42.340
 Because we demoed it at GDC,

1:16:42.340 --> 1:16:44.420
 Game Developer Conference 2013.

1:16:44.420 --> 1:16:45.420
 And people were stunned.

1:16:45.420 --> 1:16:47.380
 That's like Unreal Engine, Unreal Tournament

1:16:47.380 --> 1:16:48.860
 running in my browser window.

1:16:48.860 --> 1:16:52.660
 No plugin, no Flash, no Java, no.

1:16:52.660 --> 1:16:54.420
 So were those the early days of,

1:16:54.420 --> 1:16:58.340
 because JavaScript now is able to run basically on par

1:16:58.340 --> 1:17:01.860
 with a lot of the C++.

1:17:01.860 --> 1:17:02.780
 And even before then,

1:17:02.780 --> 1:17:05.340
 you had the fast JavaScript VMs in 2008

1:17:05.340 --> 1:17:06.520
 when Chrome came out.

1:17:06.520 --> 1:17:08.740
 Just before it came out, Mozilla,

1:17:08.740 --> 1:17:11.660
 my friend Andreas Gal and I and others

1:17:11.660 --> 1:17:14.420
 hacked out Trace Monkey, our Trace based JIT.

1:17:14.420 --> 1:17:18.700
 The Squirrel Fish Extreme team at Apple did their JIT.

1:17:18.700 --> 1:17:19.660
 And we were all competing

1:17:19.660 --> 1:17:21.860
 on these crazy performance benchmarks.

1:17:21.860 --> 1:17:23.520
 It was a little bit too much tuning to the benchmark.

1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:25.180
 But JavaScript started getting fast

1:17:25.180 --> 1:17:26.660
 and developers started noticing it.

1:17:26.660 --> 1:17:29.740
 But it was still kind of its own high level language

1:17:29.740 --> 1:17:30.740
 with garbage collection.

1:17:30.740 --> 1:17:33.220
 The Asm.js step helped us go further

1:17:33.220 --> 1:17:37.060
 because until we really proved the concept,

1:17:37.060 --> 1:17:39.340
 people were still saying, well, JavaScript's okay.

1:17:39.340 --> 1:17:40.980
 It's getting faster, thanks to V8.

1:17:40.980 --> 1:17:43.300
 Everybody gave Google credit, especially Google.

1:17:43.300 --> 1:17:44.900
 But we need something to kill Flash.

1:17:44.900 --> 1:17:47.260
 Let's use the portable native client code

1:17:47.260 --> 1:17:49.260
 that Google had acquired, native client.

1:17:50.260 --> 1:17:52.940
 Which is a separate lineage for taking basically C code,

1:17:52.940 --> 1:17:56.260
 compiling it into a software fault isolated container

1:17:56.260 --> 1:17:59.740
 of some sort using some kind of virtualization technique.

1:17:59.740 --> 1:18:01.620
 And maybe it can even be in process

1:18:01.620 --> 1:18:03.080
 and still be memory safe, that would be awesome.

1:18:03.080 --> 1:18:04.800
 But they ended up using process isolation too.

1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:06.300
 And that kind of weakened it.

1:18:06.300 --> 1:18:08.540
 And in the end, it was like portable native client,

1:18:08.540 --> 1:18:11.060
 okay, meet the new boss, same as the old boss.

1:18:11.060 --> 1:18:13.260
 This is the Google Flash, right?

1:18:13.260 --> 1:18:17.180
 But when we did Asm.js and we showed Unreal Engine working,

1:18:17.180 --> 1:18:18.660
 I think it was only a matter of time

1:18:18.660 --> 1:18:19.820
 before Google threw in the towel.

1:18:19.820 --> 1:18:23.160
 And in fact, everybody agreed in spring of 2015,

1:18:23.160 --> 1:18:25.500
 we're gonna take what was proven by Asm.js

1:18:25.500 --> 1:18:29.460
 and make a new syntax, a binary syntax, it's efficient,

1:18:29.460 --> 1:18:31.580
 that loads into the same JavaScript VM

1:18:31.580 --> 1:18:32.620
 that JavaScript loads into.

1:18:32.620 --> 1:18:34.780
 So there'll be two source languages, one VM,

1:18:34.780 --> 1:18:36.220
 very important, one garbage collector,

1:18:36.220 --> 1:18:40.780
 one memory manager, one set of compiler stages.

1:18:40.780 --> 1:18:42.300
 And that's called WebAssembly.

1:18:42.300 --> 1:18:44.260
 And that's the successor to Asm.js.

1:18:44.260 --> 1:18:46.340
 And it's important that it have binary syntax

1:18:46.340 --> 1:18:48.780
 because at the end of the day, especially on mobile,

1:18:48.780 --> 1:18:50.100
 if you're downloading JavaScript,

1:18:50.100 --> 1:18:52.040
 even if you're using LZ compression on the wire,

1:18:52.040 --> 1:18:53.940
 that's cool, but you've got to blow it out into memory

1:18:53.940 --> 1:18:56.860
 and then parse the silly eight character function keyword

1:18:56.860 --> 1:19:00.820
 that I picked, when I should have used something shorter,

1:19:00.820 --> 1:19:03.300
 I picked it because of awk, the Unix tool.

1:19:04.540 --> 1:19:05.380
 So anyways.

1:19:05.380 --> 1:19:07.940
 I want to, but I'm not following the awk thread.

1:19:07.940 --> 1:19:09.780
 Yeah, don't worry about it.

1:19:09.780 --> 1:19:12.260
 Is it surprising to you that,

1:19:12.260 --> 1:19:14.660
 how damn fast JavaScript is these days?

1:19:14.660 --> 1:19:16.900
 I mean, like, you've been through the whole journey.

1:19:16.900 --> 1:19:19.640
 I know every step of the way, but is it like,

1:19:19.640 --> 1:19:22.140
 I mean, it feels incredible.

1:19:22.140 --> 1:19:24.220
 It does, but I knew, so the funny thing is,

1:19:24.220 --> 1:19:26.860
 computer science is this big karmic wheel, right?

1:19:26.860 --> 1:19:27.940
 Wheel of Fortuna.

1:19:29.140 --> 1:19:32.460
 And in the, it's about the 97,

1:19:32.460 --> 1:19:37.100
 I was loaned by Netscape to do due diligence for Sun

1:19:37.100 --> 1:19:39.300
 in their acquisition of Anamorphic,

1:19:39.300 --> 1:19:44.300
 which was David Unger and friends, people,

1:19:45.180 --> 1:19:47.700
 Craig, I'm forgetting his name, he went to Microsoft.

1:19:47.700 --> 1:19:51.180
 These Stanford language buffs who'd taken Smalltalk

1:19:51.180 --> 1:19:53.500
 and then David create itself

1:19:53.500 --> 1:19:56.260
 as a simpler sort of Smalltalk language

1:19:56.260 --> 1:20:00.620
 and made really fast, just in time compiling VMs for them.

1:20:00.620 --> 1:20:04.320
 And they, you know, well ahead of Java hotspot

1:20:04.320 --> 1:20:07.660
 or JavaScript V8 or any of these modern VMs,

1:20:07.660 --> 1:20:10.780
 figured out how to make dynamic code fast

1:20:10.780 --> 1:20:13.100
 because Smalltalk is dynamic language, right?

1:20:13.100 --> 1:20:16.420
 It has classes, it has, I think more lockdown declarative

1:20:16.420 --> 1:20:18.500
 syntax than JavaScript, but it's fundamentally dynamic.

1:20:18.500 --> 1:20:19.900
 You don't declare the types.

1:20:19.900 --> 1:20:24.180
 But you could infer the types as the program runs

1:20:24.180 --> 1:20:26.100
 and you start to form these ideas

1:20:26.100 --> 1:20:29.100
 about what types are actually flowing through key operations

1:20:29.100 --> 1:20:32.740
 and you form little so called polymorphic inline caches

1:20:32.740 --> 1:20:35.660
 that are optimized machine code.

1:20:35.660 --> 1:20:38.340
 The cache is the machine code that assumes,

1:20:38.340 --> 1:20:40.180
 does a quick check to make sure the type is right

1:20:40.180 --> 1:20:42.420
 and if it's not right, it bails to the interpreter.

1:20:42.420 --> 1:20:44.500
 And if it is right, you go pretty fast.

1:20:44.500 --> 1:20:47.100
 And that short test is a predicted branch,

1:20:47.100 --> 1:20:48.660
 so things are pretty quick.

1:20:48.660 --> 1:20:51.340
 All that amazing stuff I knew about in the 90s

1:20:51.340 --> 1:20:53.780
 and I didn't have time to do it

1:20:53.780 --> 1:20:57.220
 and Anamorphic got bought by Sun and they did hotspot.

1:20:57.220 --> 1:21:00.060
 And you needed that even in Java because at scale,

1:21:00.060 --> 1:21:04.340
 Java has some dynamic aspects due to invoke interface.

1:21:04.340 --> 1:21:06.740
 You can have basically collections of Java code

1:21:06.740 --> 1:21:10.900
 where you don't know at the time each module

1:21:10.900 --> 1:21:13.900
 or package is compiled exactly what's being called,

1:21:13.900 --> 1:21:16.300
 what subclass or what implementation

1:21:16.300 --> 1:21:17.820
 of an interface is being called.

1:21:17.820 --> 1:21:20.100
 And so you want to optimize using this sort of dynamic

1:21:20.100 --> 1:21:21.740
 polymorphic caching there too.

1:21:21.740 --> 1:21:24.620
 And they did that and hotspot, it's amazing beast.

1:21:24.620 --> 1:21:27.740
 I've met like 13 people who all claim they created it.

1:21:27.740 --> 1:21:30.580
 I think one of them may deserve credit more than others.

1:21:31.620 --> 1:21:34.660
 But I didn't get to do that in JavaScript.

1:21:34.660 --> 1:21:38.420
 And when we knew that Google was going to do their own

1:21:38.420 --> 1:21:41.120
 browser, which we knew at Mozilla around 2006,

1:21:42.420 --> 1:21:45.140
 I also met the team that did V8.

1:21:45.140 --> 1:21:46.580
 And it turns out it was Lars Bach,

1:21:46.580 --> 1:21:49.300
 who was one of the young engineers from Anamorphic

1:21:49.300 --> 1:21:50.660
 that got acquired by Sun.

1:21:50.660 --> 1:21:52.940
 And so Lars is like one of the world's expert

1:21:52.940 --> 1:21:54.940
 on these kinds of virtual machines.

1:21:54.940 --> 1:21:56.780
 And he picked my brains about JavaScript.

1:21:56.780 --> 1:21:58.100
 I could tell he didn't like it at the time,

1:21:58.100 --> 1:21:59.920
 but he had to do it.

1:21:59.920 --> 1:22:00.760
 And...

1:22:00.760 --> 1:22:01.580
 Oh, really interesting.

1:22:01.580 --> 1:22:03.780
 Yeah, in 2006 lunch at Google's campus.

1:22:03.780 --> 1:22:07.020
 And then I had another friend who was DevRel at Chrome

1:22:07.020 --> 1:22:08.340
 and he said, yeah, we don't know what they're doing.

1:22:08.340 --> 1:22:12.020
 This is getting 2007 to fall, getting toward 2008.

1:22:12.020 --> 1:22:13.020
 We're trying to get Chrome out

1:22:13.020 --> 1:22:14.500
 and we don't know what's going with the V8 team.

1:22:14.500 --> 1:22:16.900
 They're off in Aarhus, Denmark,

1:22:16.900 --> 1:22:19.300
 rewriting their engine four times, which is good.

1:22:19.300 --> 1:22:22.300
 That's the right way to do this kind of development.

1:22:22.300 --> 1:22:24.280
 They were learning JavaScript, including all its quirks,

1:22:24.280 --> 1:22:27.020
 which they came to hate the fire of a thousand suns,

1:22:27.020 --> 1:22:29.820
 which is one of the reasons that Lars and company did Dart,

1:22:29.820 --> 1:22:30.940
 their own language.

1:22:30.940 --> 1:22:32.900
 But they also made the language fast.

1:22:32.900 --> 1:22:35.260
 And meanwhile, we knew this was happening.

1:22:35.260 --> 1:22:38.500
 So we got our act together with Trace Monkey,

1:22:38.500 --> 1:22:41.860
 our tracing JIT at Mozilla and Apple I think was also aware.

1:22:41.860 --> 1:22:43.020
 And so they were doing their own JIT.

1:22:43.020 --> 1:22:46.420
 So the era of JITed fast JavaScript in 2008

1:22:46.420 --> 1:22:49.580
 had this prehistory going back to Smalltalk itself

1:22:49.580 --> 1:22:50.980
 and Anamorphic.

1:22:50.980 --> 1:22:53.100
 And again, the lineage is interesting

1:22:53.100 --> 1:22:54.500
 because you had Lars and Anamorphic

1:22:54.500 --> 1:22:55.980
 and then he ends up at Google.

1:22:55.980 --> 1:23:00.160
 Yeah, and today we have an incredibly fast language

1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:02.860
 that like you said, still,

1:23:02.860 --> 1:23:04.780
 without hate, you can't have love.

1:23:04.780 --> 1:23:09.780
 So I think there's both love and hate for this dance,

1:23:09.820 --> 1:23:12.100
 this rich complex dance of JavaScript

1:23:12.100 --> 1:23:12.940
 throughout its history.

1:23:12.940 --> 1:23:15.300
 There's a dialectic for sure.

1:23:15.300 --> 1:23:20.140
 Today, JavaScript is the most popular language in the world.

1:23:20.140 --> 1:23:22.980
 Why by many measures?

1:23:22.980 --> 1:23:24.700
 Why do you think that is?

1:23:24.700 --> 1:23:28.420
 Is there some fundamental ideas

1:23:28.420 --> 1:23:29.740
 that you've already spoke to a little bit

1:23:29.740 --> 1:23:30.820
 but sort of broader

1:23:30.820 --> 1:23:32.820
 that you think is the most popular language in the world?

1:23:32.820 --> 1:23:36.220
 So I think I did, by doing first class functions

1:23:36.220 --> 1:23:40.780
 and taking the good parts of the C operator hierarchy

1:23:40.780 --> 1:23:44.060
 and just keeping things simple enough,

1:23:44.060 --> 1:23:45.100
 maybe it could have been simpler

1:23:45.100 --> 1:23:47.380
 but I had to make it look like Java

1:23:47.380 --> 1:23:48.780
 and interoperate with Java

1:23:48.780 --> 1:23:52.860
 that there was inherent goodness,

1:23:52.860 --> 1:23:54.420
 Aristotelian quality there.

1:23:54.420 --> 1:23:56.100
 And people perceive that

1:23:56.100 --> 1:23:57.740
 even through all the quirks and warts.

1:23:57.740 --> 1:23:59.940
 And then over time working on it with the standards body,

1:23:59.940 --> 1:24:02.800
 working on it not only as a core language

1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:06.660
 but in the context of HTML5 and making the browser better,

1:24:06.660 --> 1:24:08.940
 listening to developers, thinking about,

1:24:08.940 --> 1:24:10.860
 this is something that Nick Thompson wrote nicely

1:24:10.860 --> 1:24:12.620
 about on Hacker News, I was very flattered.

1:24:12.620 --> 1:24:14.300
 He said, Java was this thing

1:24:14.300 --> 1:24:16.000
 where the experts were writing the code

1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.020
 and it was compiled and you had to declare all your types

1:24:18.020 --> 1:24:20.980
 and Sun didn't really give a damn about

1:24:20.980 --> 1:24:23.820
 the average programmer who wanted to build real web apps,

1:24:23.820 --> 1:24:25.060
 dynamic things.

1:24:25.060 --> 1:24:28.820
 And I was in there meanwhile doing a bunch of people's jobs

1:24:28.820 --> 1:24:31.580
 making JavaScript survive those early years

1:24:31.580 --> 1:24:33.620
 when it was kind of touch and go.

1:24:33.620 --> 1:24:36.140
 JavaScript was considered a Mickey Mouse language.

1:24:36.140 --> 1:24:38.660
 It was for annoyances like the scrolling text

1:24:38.660 --> 1:24:40.780
 at the bottom of the browser in the status bar.

1:24:40.780 --> 1:24:43.060
 But I kept listening to developers working with them

1:24:43.060 --> 1:24:46.860
 and trying to make it run in that single threaded event loop

1:24:46.860 --> 1:24:47.720
 in a useful way.

1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:49.880
 And I think that forged something

1:24:49.880 --> 1:24:51.180
 that people have come to love.

1:24:51.180 --> 1:24:53.700
 Now you don't always love the best thing, right?

1:24:53.700 --> 1:24:57.020
 I talked about Shakespeare sonnet about

1:24:58.620 --> 1:25:00.180
 I'm Mr. Sizer, nothing like the sun.

1:25:00.180 --> 1:25:04.860
 Or the scene from Josh Whedon's film Serenity at the end

1:25:04.860 --> 1:25:08.340
 where the actual piece in the score by David Newman

1:25:08.340 --> 1:25:12.860
 is called Love where Captain Mal is teaching River Tam

1:25:12.860 --> 1:25:13.860
 about how to pilot the ship.

1:25:13.860 --> 1:25:15.380
 And she's a super genius, super soldier.

1:25:15.380 --> 1:25:17.100
 She knows how to do it already.

1:25:17.100 --> 1:25:19.500
 And he's basically talking about how you have to love

1:25:19.500 --> 1:25:22.020
 the ship because if you don't, it's going to kill you.

1:25:22.020 --> 1:25:23.860
 And then the piece falls off the ship.

1:25:23.860 --> 1:25:26.060
 It's kind of like JavaScript.

1:25:26.060 --> 1:25:26.900
 You have to love it.

1:25:26.900 --> 1:25:30.020
 You have to love it because now people say we're stuck

1:25:30.020 --> 1:25:31.620
 with it because it got this priority of place.

1:25:31.620 --> 1:25:33.340
 But there's love underpinning that.

1:25:33.340 --> 1:25:35.860
 And actually the listening to developers,

1:25:35.860 --> 1:25:36.700
 that's kind of beautiful.

1:25:36.700 --> 1:25:41.140
 There's most successful products in this world

1:25:41.140 --> 1:25:43.100
 with all the messes, with all the flaws.

1:25:43.100 --> 1:25:45.360
 Perhaps the flaws themselves are actual features,

1:25:45.360 --> 1:25:48.180
 but that's a whole nother, that's a discussion about love.

1:25:48.180 --> 1:25:50.220
 But underneath it, there's something

1:25:50.220 --> 1:25:52.420
 that just connects with people.

1:25:52.420 --> 1:25:53.480
 And it has to keep connecting.

1:25:53.480 --> 1:25:55.640
 If JavaScript kind of went off in this,

1:25:55.640 --> 1:25:57.340
 people sometimes complain about ES6.

1:25:57.340 --> 1:25:58.700
 Oh, you put classes in JavaScript.

1:25:58.700 --> 1:25:59.540
 I hate classes.

1:25:59.540 --> 1:26:00.420
 You've ruined it.

1:26:00.420 --> 1:26:01.420
 But it's not true.

1:26:01.420 --> 1:26:02.660
 It's a dynamic language.

1:26:02.660 --> 1:26:04.820
 Smalltalk had classes.

1:26:04.820 --> 1:26:07.060
 Python has classes.

1:26:07.060 --> 1:26:10.120
 There are lots of Lisp variants that have classy systems.

1:26:12.740 --> 1:26:16.780
 So people who don't reject it based on some sort

1:26:16.780 --> 1:26:21.780
 of fashion judgment do use it and do interact

1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:23.380
 with the standards body.

1:26:23.380 --> 1:26:25.840
 The standards body is competing browser vendors mainly,

1:26:25.840 --> 1:26:28.480
 but also now big companies that use JavaScript heavily,

1:26:28.480 --> 1:26:32.980
 the Paypal's and other such companies, Salesforce.

1:26:32.980 --> 1:26:36.300
 And they have to cater to web developers.

1:26:36.300 --> 1:26:39.020
 They have to hire developers who know JavaScript.

1:26:39.020 --> 1:26:43.100
 They have to keep their engines up to the latest standard.

1:26:43.100 --> 1:26:45.900
 And this creates all this sort of social structure

1:26:45.900 --> 1:26:47.820
 around JavaScript that is unusual.

1:26:47.820 --> 1:26:51.420
 I mean, you get C++ buffs that follow the inner workings

1:26:51.420 --> 1:26:54.460
 of C++, what is it now?

1:26:54.460 --> 1:26:56.580
 21 something, I don't know.

1:26:56.580 --> 1:26:57.500
 I've lost track.

1:26:57.500 --> 1:26:59.020
 But it's a more rarefied group.

1:26:59.020 --> 1:27:02.860
 It's more like the old language, gray hairs.

1:27:02.860 --> 1:27:04.500
 Whereas JavaScript is a younger

1:27:04.500 --> 1:27:07.380
 and more vibrant and large crowd.

1:27:07.380 --> 1:27:09.260
 There's a community feel to it.

1:27:09.260 --> 1:27:13.180
 There's echoes, perhaps I don't wanna draw too many

1:27:13.180 --> 1:27:15.420
 similarities, maybe you can comment on it.

1:27:15.420 --> 1:27:18.980
 There's C++ is like Wall Street,

1:27:18.980 --> 1:27:21.220
 and the JavaScript is like Wall Street bets

1:27:21.220 --> 1:27:22.620
 from the recent events.

1:27:22.620 --> 1:27:24.940
 It's like there's a chaotic community of all,

1:27:24.940 --> 1:27:28.820
 and there's some power from that distributed crowd

1:27:28.820 --> 1:27:30.260
 of people that ultimately.

1:27:30.260 --> 1:27:32.660
 It's more thematic, it's more of the people.

1:27:32.660 --> 1:27:35.860
 It lets people in without requiring these credentials.

1:27:35.860 --> 1:27:38.420
 I remember in the late 90s into the 90s,

1:27:38.420 --> 1:27:39.900
 people were all getting Java credentials.

1:27:39.900 --> 1:27:42.700
 And I knew people, and friends knew people

1:27:42.700 --> 1:27:44.580
 who became Java programmers, and you knew

1:27:44.580 --> 1:27:47.260
 they really should have been like nature guides or pilots.

1:27:47.260 --> 1:27:49.020
 They hated programming, but they thought,

1:27:49.020 --> 1:27:51.780
 I gotta make money, I'm gonna become a Java programmer.

1:27:51.780 --> 1:27:55.060
 Do you have some, because it's such a monumental moment

1:27:55.060 --> 1:27:58.060
 in our current history, as a quick aside,

1:27:58.060 --> 1:28:03.060
 do you have thoughts about this huge distributed crowdsourced

1:28:03.260 --> 1:28:06.740
 financial happenings with Wall Street bets?

1:28:06.740 --> 1:28:08.780
 That's like nobody could have, well,

1:28:08.780 --> 1:28:11.420
 you could have predicted, but the scale and the impact

1:28:11.420 --> 1:28:13.260
 of this kind of emergent behavior

1:28:13.260 --> 1:28:15.780
 from independent parties that could happen.

1:28:15.780 --> 1:28:19.900
 Like I said, my own experience with the dismal science,

1:28:19.900 --> 1:28:23.500
 as with physics, led me to reject a lot of bad models.

1:28:23.500 --> 1:28:26.260
 Economics was always compromised by politics,

1:28:26.260 --> 1:28:28.220
 political economy.

1:28:28.220 --> 1:28:29.460
 You could also argue that it was,

1:28:29.460 --> 1:28:30.980
 it used to be a branch of moral philosophy,

1:28:30.980 --> 1:28:32.460
 so it was concerned with the good,

1:28:32.460 --> 1:28:34.740
 and it became divorced and became sort of

1:28:34.740 --> 1:28:37.700
 in this quasi Newtonian way, just about,

1:28:37.700 --> 1:28:40.220
 everything's just running by itself, don't worry about it.

1:28:40.220 --> 1:28:42.060
 This monopoly's crushing your Netscape company,

1:28:42.060 --> 1:28:43.700
 but that's just nature.

1:28:43.700 --> 1:28:46.580
 And economics couldn't, or doesn't really have good models

1:28:46.580 --> 1:28:49.500
 for the Wall Street bets subreddit.

1:28:49.500 --> 1:28:52.300
 You know, they know how to squeeze a short, right?

1:28:52.300 --> 1:28:56.460
 So the amazing thing is you have Robinhood app,

1:28:56.460 --> 1:29:00.740
 which was, again, supposedly for the demos, for the people,

1:29:00.740 --> 1:29:05.180
 and eliminated the fee through various kinds of straddles

1:29:06.300 --> 1:29:09.220
 or some kind of spread operation

1:29:09.220 --> 1:29:11.860
 that helped them eliminate the fee or eat the fee.

1:29:11.860 --> 1:29:14.540
 And in fact, as a broker in these days,

1:29:14.540 --> 1:29:15.820
 because it takes two days to settle,

1:29:15.820 --> 1:29:18.620
 there's counterparty risk, as they found out.

1:29:18.620 --> 1:29:22.980
 And so the Wall Street bets people,

1:29:22.980 --> 1:29:25.700
 you know, the memes are like the Terminator robot

1:29:25.700 --> 1:29:30.140
 with the $600 STEMI check and the hedge funds

1:29:30.140 --> 1:29:32.420
 that make little girl hiding under the desk.

1:29:34.060 --> 1:29:36.060
 There is a problem, which I talked about

1:29:36.060 --> 1:29:38.300
 in a recent podcast, which I'm conscious of

1:29:38.300 --> 1:29:40.020
 from the history of the web, and that is,

1:29:40.020 --> 1:29:41.260
 you could say it's monopoly,

1:29:41.260 --> 1:29:42.980
 which antitrust wasn't enforced

1:29:42.980 --> 1:29:45.140
 after USB Microsoft for a long time.

1:29:45.140 --> 1:29:48.020
 And a lot of this was due to the money interests

1:29:48.020 --> 1:29:50.900
 buying control of politicians.

1:29:50.900 --> 1:29:54.460
 And, you know, in Plato's five regimes, that's oligarchy.

1:29:54.460 --> 1:29:56.060
 That's where we are.

1:29:56.060 --> 1:29:58.780
 And now we're seeing a fight against the oligarchs.

1:29:58.780 --> 1:29:59.620
 I don't know if it'll work,

1:29:59.620 --> 1:30:00.780
 but you're definitely seeing it.

1:30:00.780 --> 1:30:02.420
 And it's also kind of hackerish, right?

1:30:02.420 --> 1:30:04.100
 It's got a hacker ethos.

1:30:04.100 --> 1:30:05.660
 You know, hey, Robinhood, no fees.

1:30:05.660 --> 1:30:06.500
 Oh, interesting.

1:30:06.500 --> 1:30:09.180
 Hey, you know, I could buy a fraction of a share

1:30:09.180 --> 1:30:12.300
 in this thing, or I can keep buying with my stimulus check.

1:30:12.300 --> 1:30:16.980
 So I mentioned Hegel seeing Napoleon on the horse, right?

1:30:16.980 --> 1:30:19.220
 Hegel also talked about the cunning of reason

1:30:19.220 --> 1:30:21.380
 that you have this sort of, you know,

1:30:21.380 --> 1:30:24.100
 God sees history in full, and if you believe in God,

1:30:24.100 --> 1:30:25.940
 or, you know, we don't know the future,

1:30:25.940 --> 1:30:28.380
 but there's always this sort of fly in the ointment,

1:30:28.380 --> 1:30:32.140
 this unintended consequence that confounds

1:30:32.140 --> 1:30:35.660
 the best plans of the powers that be.

1:30:35.660 --> 1:30:37.060
 And we're living through it.

1:30:37.060 --> 1:30:39.700
 I'm glad it's not, you know, street warfare

1:30:39.700 --> 1:30:43.380
 or mechanized warfare, because it has been in the past.

1:30:43.380 --> 1:30:48.380
 It's more like soft power, and people are fighting back.

1:30:50.620 --> 1:30:51.740
 Do you think it's possible?

1:30:51.740 --> 1:30:56.740
 So JavaScript used to be for the front end of the web.

1:30:57.100 --> 1:31:01.620
 It's now increasingly so being used for back end,

1:31:01.620 --> 1:31:06.060
 like running stuff that's like behind the scenes.

1:31:06.060 --> 1:31:10.260
 And it's also starting to be used quite a bit

1:31:10.260 --> 1:31:12.260
 for things like TensorFlow.js.

1:31:12.260 --> 1:31:14.700
 So starting to actually use like these heavy duty

1:31:14.700 --> 1:31:17.140
 applications that are using neural networks,

1:31:17.140 --> 1:31:19.380
 machine learning, and so on in the browser.

1:31:19.380 --> 1:31:24.140
 Is it possible in 10, 20, 30 years

1:31:24.140 --> 1:31:28.660
 that basically most of the world runs on JavaScript?

1:31:28.660 --> 1:31:31.260
 This is a dystopia and a nightmare to some people.

1:31:32.380 --> 1:31:34.940
 When we did Asm.js and WebAssembly,

1:31:34.940 --> 1:31:37.340
 I would joke and mean people with scenes like

1:31:37.340 --> 1:31:39.500
 Neo waking up in his pod in the matrix,

1:31:39.500 --> 1:31:42.380
 and he's all skinny and weak and hairless.

1:31:42.380 --> 1:31:46.220
 And, you know, you realize in the future

1:31:46.220 --> 1:31:48.020
 that you're living in some simulation

1:31:48.020 --> 1:31:49.180
 that it's all running on JavaScript,

1:31:49.180 --> 1:31:50.580
 and you just scream forever.

1:31:51.980 --> 1:31:52.820
 It's possible.

1:31:52.820 --> 1:31:54.860
 Gary Bernhardt does these funny talks.

1:31:54.860 --> 1:31:56.860
 He did watch.js, and then he did this

1:31:58.020 --> 1:31:59.540
 life and death of JavaScript, I think it's called,

1:31:59.540 --> 1:32:02.580
 where he took some clever ideas that actually have

1:32:02.580 --> 1:32:05.340
 a thread of credibility to them.

1:32:05.340 --> 1:32:09.220
 But I mentioned software fault isolation.

1:32:09.220 --> 1:32:10.620
 In the old days, when we were using computers,

1:32:10.620 --> 1:32:14.140
 we said we're gonna use the Unix monolithic monitor,

1:32:14.140 --> 1:32:15.980
 and it's the privileged program.

1:32:15.980 --> 1:32:18.420
 This is before you even had hardware rings of protection.

1:32:18.420 --> 1:32:20.460
 Those, some of the early 60s operating systems

1:32:20.460 --> 1:32:22.700
 used hardware protection zones.

1:32:22.700 --> 1:32:25.900
 But Unix is privileged, and the program

1:32:25.900 --> 1:32:30.460
 that runs user code in a process is hosted.

1:32:30.460 --> 1:32:33.660
 It's the guest, in the host, and you get to suspend it.

1:32:33.660 --> 1:32:35.220
 You get to kill it.

1:32:35.220 --> 1:32:37.300
 If it crashes, it doesn't take down the whole OS.

1:32:37.300 --> 1:32:41.940
 It's a wonderful idea, but the call into the kernel

1:32:41.940 --> 1:32:43.820
 is expensive, the system call, so called.

1:32:43.820 --> 1:32:45.180
 And this has even been optimized now

1:32:45.180 --> 1:32:46.320
 for things like getting the time of day,

1:32:46.320 --> 1:32:48.420
 so it doesn't actually enter the kernel.

1:32:49.580 --> 1:32:52.780
 And meanwhile, hardware architectures

1:32:52.780 --> 1:32:54.460
 and virtualization techniques have gone

1:32:54.460 --> 1:32:56.380
 in a different direction, even to the point

1:32:56.380 --> 1:32:58.840
 where you can do software fault isolation very cheaply

1:32:58.840 --> 1:33:00.740
 without entering the operating system kernel,

1:33:00.740 --> 1:33:02.940
 and so you get unikernels and exokernels

1:33:02.940 --> 1:33:04.460
 and very lightweight VMs.

1:33:04.460 --> 1:33:08.060
 And so Gary took this idea and said, JavaScript

1:33:08.060 --> 1:33:10.540
 will take over computing, because the system call

1:33:10.540 --> 1:33:12.340
 boundary's too expensive, so everything ends up

1:33:12.340 --> 1:33:14.220
 in JavaScript with these lighter weight

1:33:14.220 --> 1:33:16.940
 isolation enforcement mechanisms.

1:33:16.940 --> 1:33:18.580
 It's not totally beyond belief.

1:33:18.580 --> 1:33:20.880
 It'd be WebAssembly too.

1:33:22.100 --> 1:33:25.380
 It's nice to ask you sort of for advice to,

1:33:25.380 --> 1:33:26.980
 there's so many people that are interested

1:33:26.980 --> 1:33:29.180
 in starting to learning about programming,

1:33:29.180 --> 1:33:31.180
 getting into this world.

1:33:31.180 --> 1:33:34.980
 Is there some number of languages,

1:33:34.980 --> 1:33:36.460
 three to five programming languages

1:33:36.460 --> 1:33:38.220
 that you would recommend people learn,

1:33:38.220 --> 1:33:42.060
 or maybe a broader advice on how

1:33:42.060 --> 1:33:43.940
 to get started in programming?

1:33:43.940 --> 1:33:45.380
 Well, so you asked about machine learning,

1:33:45.380 --> 1:33:47.820
 and JavaScript is a general purpose language,

1:33:47.820 --> 1:33:52.820
 and it's a language that's not that great

1:33:53.100 --> 1:33:58.100
 for doing matrix operations or doing parallel programming,

1:33:58.100 --> 1:34:01.100
 I would say, without using some extensions

1:34:01.100 --> 1:34:03.620
 or some libraries that have some magic in them.

1:34:03.620 --> 1:34:06.800
 So if someone wanted to learn,

1:34:08.580 --> 1:34:11.100
 there are amazing languages in sort of the APL family

1:34:11.100 --> 1:34:14.060
 that are very useful for, I would say, linear algebra,

1:34:14.060 --> 1:34:16.820
 which gets to a lot of the kernels in machine learning.

1:34:16.820 --> 1:34:21.820
 And so APL had like J and then K and their K variants

1:34:22.240 --> 1:34:24.660
 because the guy that did K is still going,

1:34:24.660 --> 1:34:28.900
 and they're proprietary, but he's still innovating there.

1:34:28.900 --> 1:34:30.420
 There are, you know, Python is used.

1:34:30.420 --> 1:34:31.740
 So people talk about TensorFlow.js.

1:34:31.740 --> 1:34:33.460
 Well, it's not that surprising

1:34:33.460 --> 1:34:36.380
 because Python was heavily used for machine learning,

1:34:36.380 --> 1:34:38.740
 and Python was always, you know,

1:34:38.740 --> 1:34:41.540
 they didn't have this fast just in time compiler tradition.

1:34:41.540 --> 1:34:43.180
 There were some projects that tried this,

1:34:43.180 --> 1:34:45.340
 and some of them were interesting.

1:34:45.340 --> 1:34:46.300
 PyPy was interesting,

1:34:46.300 --> 1:34:50.020
 but the philosophy with Python was,

1:34:50.020 --> 1:34:51.780
 oh, you need to go fast, write a C plugin,

1:34:51.780 --> 1:34:53.300
 and drop into C code.

1:34:53.300 --> 1:34:57.500
 So I think people should look at multiple languages

1:34:57.500 --> 1:34:59.500
 because there are different tools in the belt.

1:34:59.500 --> 1:35:02.820
 If you're trying to do supervision or rapid prototyping,

1:35:02.820 --> 1:35:03.900
 you want a dynamic language.

1:35:03.900 --> 1:35:06.500
 You want to throw things together and see what works.

1:35:06.500 --> 1:35:09.280
 If you are trying to go down to the metal very fast,

1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:10.740
 well, I'm an old C hacker,

1:35:10.740 --> 1:35:14.300
 but I was also the executive sponsor of Rust at Mozilla,

1:35:14.300 --> 1:35:16.180
 and Rust has now escaped, you know,

1:35:16.180 --> 1:35:18.540
 from that sort of nest where it was born

1:35:18.540 --> 1:35:21.460
 to be adopted by a bunch of companies

1:35:21.460 --> 1:35:23.220
 that have a foundation in the works.

1:35:23.220 --> 1:35:24.780
 Some of the key core team members

1:35:24.780 --> 1:35:27.700
 are working now at Amazon and other places.

1:35:27.700 --> 1:35:30.100
 So it looks like Rust has reached escape velocity,

1:35:30.100 --> 1:35:31.380
 and Rust is an interesting language

1:35:31.380 --> 1:35:33.060
 because one of our goals there,

1:35:33.060 --> 1:35:35.300
 one of the reasons I sponsored it was we were all tired

1:35:35.300 --> 1:35:38.100
 of seeing those remote code execution vulnerabilities

1:35:38.100 --> 1:35:41.240
 due to C and C++, and we thought,

1:35:41.240 --> 1:35:43.840
 can we have a sort of safety property

1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:46.920
 through a type and effect system or an ownership system,

1:35:46.920 --> 1:35:48.300
 and Rust has that.

1:35:48.300 --> 1:35:50.020
 And that ownership system is interesting

1:35:50.020 --> 1:35:52.140
 because it doesn't just give you memory safety.

1:35:52.140 --> 1:35:53.500
 There's a sort of theorem for free,

1:35:53.500 --> 1:35:57.220
 a dual that falls out for protection against data races.

1:35:57.220 --> 1:35:59.740
 So Rust is better for low level programming.

1:35:59.740 --> 1:36:01.100
 You delimit your unsafe code

1:36:01.100 --> 1:36:02.900
 where you do have to be unsafe,

1:36:02.900 --> 1:36:05.300
 and you can prove certain facts about memory safety

1:36:05.300 --> 1:36:08.820
 and race condition avoidance.

1:36:08.820 --> 1:36:11.340
 And so I think people should learn these new languages.

1:36:11.340 --> 1:36:13.380
 I think Go is a great language.

1:36:13.380 --> 1:36:16.540
 I admire, you know, the Unix people who did that.

1:36:16.540 --> 1:36:20.580
 Ken Stoll was involved, Rob Pike, of course, David,

1:36:21.420 --> 1:36:23.440
 what's his name, and other people.

1:36:23.440 --> 1:36:27.100
 Go is a huge success, really on the server side,

1:36:27.100 --> 1:36:30.140
 anywhere you have a lot of networking to do,

1:36:30.140 --> 1:36:33.780
 and it's garbage collected, but it's also very pragmatic.

1:36:33.780 --> 1:36:35.420
 It has that sort of C flavor.

1:36:35.420 --> 1:36:37.020
 As an old C hacker, I can't get used to the fact

1:36:37.020 --> 1:36:39.620
 that they swapped the type and declarator

1:36:39.620 --> 1:36:41.140
 in the declaration order.

1:36:41.140 --> 1:36:44.180
 I haven't used Rust, but this is one of the most respected

1:36:44.180 --> 1:36:46.260
 and loved languages currently, so it's interesting.

1:36:46.260 --> 1:36:47.380
 Yeah, and it's still young.

1:36:47.380 --> 1:36:50.980
 You look at these things, JavaScript is now considered old.

1:36:50.980 --> 1:36:52.500
 It's gone through so many versions

1:36:52.500 --> 1:36:54.860
 that you can fall in love with it all over again.

1:36:54.860 --> 1:36:57.740
 25 plus years, you know, it's an adult.

1:36:58.740 --> 1:36:59.800
 It should be out of the house.

1:36:59.800 --> 1:37:03.420
 But it could be around another 25 years.

1:37:03.420 --> 1:37:04.240
 Cannot rule it out.

1:37:04.240 --> 1:37:06.260
 So Rust will be around for a long time.

1:37:06.260 --> 1:37:08.900
 The longer you're around, the more likely you're Lindy,

1:37:08.900 --> 1:37:10.400
 and you're around your wife.

1:37:10.400 --> 1:37:11.900
 A lot of people ask me, like,

1:37:13.500 --> 1:37:15.780
 I'm often torn between recommending either Python

1:37:15.780 --> 1:37:18.100
 or JavaScript as the first language to play with,

1:37:18.100 --> 1:37:20.900
 because, I mean, it's difficult,

1:37:20.900 --> 1:37:25.180
 because it's so easy to do JavaScript incorrectly.

1:37:25.180 --> 1:37:29.460
 It's much easier to do it correctly these days,

1:37:29.460 --> 1:37:31.620
 or like, well, learn about programming.

1:37:31.620 --> 1:37:33.940
 But the cool thing about JavaScript

1:37:33.940 --> 1:37:36.100
 is that you can create stuff

1:37:36.100 --> 1:37:38.140
 that will put a smile on your face.

1:37:38.140 --> 1:37:41.460
 Like, as a developer, you can create stuff,

1:37:41.460 --> 1:37:43.060
 and it'll visually look like something,

1:37:43.060 --> 1:37:45.700
 and it'll do stuff, and it makes you feel good.

1:37:45.700 --> 1:37:47.340
 It makes you fall in love with programming.

1:37:47.340 --> 1:37:48.700
 With Python, you could do the same.

1:37:48.700 --> 1:37:49.540
 It's a little slower.

1:37:49.540 --> 1:37:51.580
 And with C++, it takes five to 10 years

1:37:51.580 --> 1:37:54.100
 to write a program that actually does something.

1:37:54.100 --> 1:37:56.820
 So, like, there's that tension between

1:37:56.820 --> 1:37:59.460
 is JavaScript the right first step, or is it Python?

1:37:59.460 --> 1:38:02.060
 And I've been going back and forth on those two.

1:38:02.060 --> 1:38:05.300
 My Python, right, it came from a lineage of ABC,

1:38:05.300 --> 1:38:08.600
 which was a pedagogical language in the Netherlands.

1:38:09.580 --> 1:38:12.140
 And it, you know,

1:38:12.140 --> 1:38:16.700
 it was a good teaching language, too.

1:38:16.700 --> 1:38:17.980
 I think it is a good teaching language,

1:38:17.980 --> 1:38:19.100
 and it's a little more restrictive

1:38:19.100 --> 1:38:21.980
 in that if you misspell something

1:38:21.980 --> 1:38:25.220
 in a way that JavaScript might let run,

1:38:25.220 --> 1:38:26.860
 let reach runtime, it'll get stopped

1:38:26.860 --> 1:38:30.600
 at syntax check in Python.

1:38:30.600 --> 1:38:31.700
 That's good for beginners.

1:38:31.700 --> 1:38:34.760
 I think the sloppiness that some people object to,

1:38:34.760 --> 1:38:37.140
 like, people were just tweeting at me,

1:38:37.140 --> 1:38:38.660
 having just learned JavaScript.

1:38:38.660 --> 1:38:41.160
 They said, I can take a number, and I can index into it,

1:38:41.160 --> 1:38:43.180
 and get undefined out of it as a property.

1:38:43.180 --> 1:38:44.020
 Why is that?

1:38:44.020 --> 1:38:44.860
 A number's not an object.

1:38:44.860 --> 1:38:46.180
 And I explained why it is,

1:38:46.180 --> 1:38:48.340
 because like in Java, the primitive types,

1:38:48.340 --> 1:38:49.840
 which unfortunately are not objects,

1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:53.260
 can be automatically boxed or wrapped by an object.

1:38:53.260 --> 1:38:55.440
 And I made that implicit.

1:38:55.440 --> 1:38:58.240
 In Java, it's typed, and you have to declare things,

1:38:58.240 --> 1:39:00.500
 and you'll get type errors.

1:39:00.500 --> 1:39:03.080
 But there are cases in Java where you get auto boxing

1:39:03.080 --> 1:39:06.020
 or auto wrapping, because you've declared that you want it.

1:39:06.020 --> 1:39:07.580
 In JavaScript, it just happens.

1:39:07.580 --> 1:39:10.300
 And so once I explained it, like, oh, wow, I get it.

1:39:10.300 --> 1:39:13.540
 But it also means that you can commit a blunder that just.

1:39:13.540 --> 1:39:15.360
 You don't get punished for it, you don't detect.

1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:16.800
 You get an undefined value,

1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:17.860
 and you don't know where it came from.

1:39:17.860 --> 1:39:18.700
 Right.

1:39:19.900 --> 1:39:23.340
 I've been reading a lot about military history recently.

1:39:23.340 --> 1:39:26.780
 And one way to paint the picture of browsers,

1:39:26.780 --> 1:39:29.280
 internet browsers, is through the various wars

1:39:29.280 --> 1:39:30.620
 throughout its history.

1:39:30.620 --> 1:39:32.300
 I don't know if that's a useful way to look at it,

1:39:32.300 --> 1:39:34.660
 but we've already talked a little bit about Netscape

1:39:34.660 --> 1:39:38.420
 and Internet Explorer in the early days.

1:39:38.420 --> 1:39:41.260
 Can you tell the story of the different wars,

1:39:41.260 --> 1:39:43.420
 if that's at all an interesting way to look at it,

1:39:43.420 --> 1:39:46.460
 of the 90s and to today?

1:39:46.460 --> 1:39:47.300
 Yeah.

1:39:47.300 --> 1:39:49.100
 So I mentioned that Microsoft, you know,

1:39:49.100 --> 1:39:51.500
 which was convicted for it, did abuse its monopoly,

1:39:51.500 --> 1:39:55.100
 but they had a pretty good team by the time they did IE4.

1:39:55.100 --> 1:39:57.900
 And Netscape, unfortunately, I was like second floor,

1:39:57.900 --> 1:39:59.540
 and I was friends with all the first floor people,

1:39:59.540 --> 1:40:02.700
 the front end guys who did the JavaScript event hookup

1:40:02.700 --> 1:40:03.740
 and things like that,

1:40:04.700 --> 1:40:07.580
 that that team was fairly burnt out.

1:40:07.580 --> 1:40:10.900
 And I think having gone public,

1:40:10.900 --> 1:40:13.300
 the upper management wanted to buy a bunch of companies

1:40:13.300 --> 1:40:15.340
 to try to go head to head with Microsoft.

1:40:15.340 --> 1:40:17.740
 Didn't work, but buying a bunch of companies

1:40:17.740 --> 1:40:19.380
 usually doesn't work.

1:40:19.380 --> 1:40:22.800
 I think the modern sort of approach roughly

1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:25.260
 is like Mark Zuckerberg took,

1:40:25.260 --> 1:40:26.860
 which is to keep them at arm's length

1:40:26.860 --> 1:40:28.300
 and let them do their thing.

1:40:28.300 --> 1:40:29.900
 And now that he's pulling WhatsApp in

1:40:29.900 --> 1:40:31.420
 and people are fleeing it

1:40:31.420 --> 1:40:33.480
 because it's tied into the ad surveillance.

1:40:33.480 --> 1:40:36.260
 But, you know, for a while,

1:40:36.260 --> 1:40:37.660
 they're keeping it separate really does work

1:40:37.660 --> 1:40:39.020
 because you bought it for its value,

1:40:39.020 --> 1:40:41.140
 it's complimentary, and you're not messing with it.

1:40:41.140 --> 1:40:43.600
 With Netscape, when they bought a bunch of companies,

1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:45.500
 they had some of the first floor people

1:40:45.500 --> 1:40:46.940
 or the founders burned out.

1:40:46.940 --> 1:40:51.460
 They had newcomers who wanted their turn to do the browser,

1:40:51.460 --> 1:40:54.540
 and they hadn't really done browsers or understood them.

1:40:54.540 --> 1:40:57.340
 And so Netscape 4 was originally supposed to be 3,

1:40:57.340 --> 1:40:58.820
 and it was so late, they renumbered it.

1:40:58.820 --> 1:41:00.560
 We did a 3 release.

1:41:00.560 --> 1:41:03.060
 Jamie and a few others put some extra effort into.

1:41:03.060 --> 1:41:08.060
 SecureMine was supported in the built in mail program.

1:41:08.340 --> 1:41:10.200
 And Netscape 4 was late,

1:41:10.200 --> 1:41:11.860
 and it was only on Windows at first,

1:41:11.860 --> 1:41:14.920
 and Microsoft had really started doing better,

1:41:14.920 --> 1:41:15.760
 like they do.

1:41:15.760 --> 1:41:17.300
 They copy, and the first version's trash,

1:41:17.300 --> 1:41:19.100
 and the second one, you're starting to feel threatened.

1:41:19.100 --> 1:41:21.460
 The third one, you can tell what's gonna happen,

1:41:21.460 --> 1:41:22.460
 and the fourth one's good.

1:41:22.460 --> 1:41:24.260
 And plus there's the benefit, like you said,

1:41:24.260 --> 1:41:26.120
 that it comes as a default browser.

1:41:26.120 --> 1:41:28.780
 Yes, and yet Netscape's screwing it up,

1:41:28.780 --> 1:41:32.540
 and Microsoft really putting some quality people on it.

1:41:32.540 --> 1:41:33.380
 IE4 was good.

1:41:33.380 --> 1:41:34.220
 On Windows, it was good.

1:41:34.220 --> 1:41:37.180
 And they did the dynamic HTML innovations.

1:41:38.300 --> 1:41:39.700
 Scott Isaac's my old buddy,

1:41:39.700 --> 1:41:42.360
 a former accountant who programmed in BASIC

1:41:42.360 --> 1:41:45.500
 and became what Microsoft calls a program manager,

1:41:45.500 --> 1:41:47.300
 which is kind of an elevated position.

1:41:48.760 --> 1:41:50.500
 You can be a programmer or an engineer and track,

1:41:50.500 --> 1:41:51.340
 but you switch to it,

1:41:51.340 --> 1:41:54.700
 and you sort of lead a lot of design and standards efforts.

1:41:54.700 --> 1:41:58.940
 And so Scott Isaac put in a lot of those funky DHTML APIs

1:41:58.940 --> 1:42:01.020
 that didn't quite have the same flavor

1:42:01.020 --> 1:42:03.260
 as the stuff that I did, and neither of them

1:42:03.260 --> 1:42:05.540
 was like the later sort of verbose Java,

1:42:05.540 --> 1:42:08.540
 like DOM W3C standardized.

1:42:08.540 --> 1:42:10.540
 But IE4 was pretty darn good.

1:42:10.540 --> 1:42:12.460
 I remember a friend, Scott Furman and I,

1:42:12.460 --> 1:42:16.700
 got invited by Scott Isaac to Gordon Beers in San Jose.

1:42:16.700 --> 1:42:19.340
 They were doing a preview of IE4.

1:42:19.340 --> 1:42:21.500
 This must have been 1997.

1:42:21.500 --> 1:42:25.140
 And Scott said, yeah, here's the new graphics stuff

1:42:25.140 --> 1:42:25.980
 we're doing.

1:42:25.980 --> 1:42:28.220
 We've got something like your Netscape layers.

1:42:28.220 --> 1:42:31.740
 We've got VML, a vector markup language.

1:42:31.740 --> 1:42:33.420
 We can do virtual reality.

1:42:33.420 --> 1:42:35.260
 And Scott and I looked at each other and said,

1:42:35.260 --> 1:42:36.820
 we're doomed, right?

1:42:36.820 --> 1:42:38.780
 Microsoft was starting to fire on all cylinders.

1:42:38.780 --> 1:42:40.460
 So I have to give them credit for that,

1:42:40.460 --> 1:42:42.940
 even though they abused their market power.

1:42:42.940 --> 1:42:44.320
 And maybe I shouldn't give them credit

1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:45.940
 for having the resources to hire talented people,

1:42:45.940 --> 1:42:48.900
 but they did a credible job on IE4.

1:42:48.900 --> 1:42:51.940
 What really was bad was that phase of the browser wars

1:42:51.940 --> 1:42:56.100
 ended with monopoly and perhaps due to the antitrust case,

1:42:56.100 --> 1:42:58.140
 perhaps due to regulation in Europe,

1:42:59.340 --> 1:43:01.100
 perhaps just due to Microsoft not liking

1:43:01.100 --> 1:43:05.420
 dealing with standardization, they let it rot.

1:43:05.420 --> 1:43:10.420
 They just abandoned it, IE5, 5.5, IE6 later,

1:43:10.520 --> 1:43:12.300
 but these were not well maintained.

1:43:12.300 --> 1:43:14.420
 They had a lot of security bugs.

1:43:14.420 --> 1:43:16.660
 It felt really closed and outdated too,

1:43:16.660 --> 1:43:19.020
 even though it's getting updated, it's just weird.

1:43:19.020 --> 1:43:22.100
 Browsers like Mozilla and then Firefox were adding tabs.

1:43:22.100 --> 1:43:25.940
 Opera had a version of tabs and they didn't add tabs.

1:43:25.940 --> 1:43:27.560
 And they pop up blocking,

1:43:27.560 --> 1:43:28.860
 something I should have done from the start.

1:43:28.860 --> 1:43:30.160
 People realized that you can tell

1:43:30.160 --> 1:43:31.540
 when the user clicks something

1:43:31.540 --> 1:43:34.300
 and it goes in JavaScript to open a little window,

1:43:34.300 --> 1:43:36.220
 that you can sort of inspect the stack

1:43:36.220 --> 1:43:38.140
 and see that the click originated that,

1:43:38.140 --> 1:43:39.420
 and it's probably okay.

1:43:39.420 --> 1:43:40.820
 Whereas if you're just loading a script

1:43:40.820 --> 1:43:43.860
 and it opens a new window, that's a spam technique

1:43:43.860 --> 1:43:45.220
 and you should block it.

1:43:45.220 --> 1:43:47.380
 Tabs were a brilliant innovation.

1:43:47.380 --> 1:43:48.380
 Like you said, Opera had it,

1:43:48.380 --> 1:43:52.060
 but I remember I fully switched to Firefox the moment.

1:43:52.060 --> 1:43:57.060
 I remember the moments of first using tabs in Firefox

1:43:57.060 --> 1:44:00.220
 and not liking it for the first few minutes,

1:44:00.220 --> 1:44:02.460
 and then like, wait a minute.

1:44:02.460 --> 1:44:03.300
 You get the groove, yeah.

1:44:03.300 --> 1:44:05.580
 You get the groove and you understand.

1:44:05.580 --> 1:44:08.540
 So that timing, what year was this?

1:44:08.540 --> 1:44:12.100
 Because also as a aspiring web designer,

1:44:12.100 --> 1:44:16.260
 I use Table, so we didn't mention Layout or CSS much.

1:44:16.260 --> 1:44:18.760
 There's also a change in the way

1:44:18.760 --> 1:44:21.100
 the frames were going away.

1:44:21.100 --> 1:44:23.620
 So there's a change in the way websites looked

1:44:23.620 --> 1:44:25.300
 and behaved and all that kind of stuff.

1:44:25.300 --> 1:44:28.420
 CSS finally, which Microsoft embraced with IA4

1:44:28.420 --> 1:44:30.700
 and Netscape never really did right.

1:44:30.700 --> 1:44:33.440
 CSS became a better standard over time

1:44:33.440 --> 1:44:36.140
 for doing Table Layout that relieved you

1:44:36.140 --> 1:44:39.260
 of the need to use what are called spacer GIFs,

1:44:39.260 --> 1:44:40.300
 spacer GIFs, right?

1:44:40.300 --> 1:44:42.880
 Images, you would throw into space at tables.

1:44:44.180 --> 1:44:47.460
 The typographic power of the web has gotten better,

1:44:47.460 --> 1:44:49.320
 but it's still not on the level of PDF

1:44:49.320 --> 1:44:51.580
 and you can't do advanced typography,

1:44:51.580 --> 1:44:53.180
 but it's gotten really better.

1:44:53.180 --> 1:44:54.920
 And even then, tables were getting better.

1:44:54.920 --> 1:44:57.260
 If you were using Firefox, that would have been 2004

1:44:57.260 --> 1:45:00.260
 because it was called Firebird until earlier that year.

1:45:00.260 --> 1:45:01.860
 No, yeah, I think it wasn't.

1:45:01.860 --> 1:45:02.700
 2003.

1:45:02.700 --> 1:45:06.100
 I don't remember, it was a Firebird, which had tabs?

1:45:06.100 --> 1:45:07.060
 We had tabs the whole way.

1:45:07.060 --> 1:45:10.420
 So it started out as Mozilla slash browser in 2002,

1:45:10.420 --> 1:45:12.080
 became Phoenix.

1:45:12.080 --> 1:45:14.700
 There's a BIOS that has an embedded version of IE

1:45:14.700 --> 1:45:16.420
 and they said, we're called Phoenix Technologies,

1:45:16.420 --> 1:45:17.620
 you can't use Phoenix.

1:45:17.620 --> 1:45:19.180
 And so we said, okay, we'll call it Firebird.

1:45:19.180 --> 1:45:21.220
 And then this Australian centered

1:45:21.220 --> 1:45:24.900
 open source database project started really like

1:45:24.900 --> 1:45:27.340
 in the true Mad Max style, just screaming at us saying,

1:45:27.340 --> 1:45:28.380
 you can't use Firebird.

1:45:28.380 --> 1:45:30.660
 And I had to sort of be the ambassador and say,

1:45:30.660 --> 1:45:31.500
 okay, we're gonna rename.

1:45:31.500 --> 1:45:32.340
 And they're like, we don't believe you,

1:45:32.340 --> 1:45:33.700
 you shouldn't have used it, we hate you.

1:45:33.700 --> 1:45:36.100
 And then we renamed it to Firefox.

1:45:36.100 --> 1:45:38.060
 And they're like, ah, we love you.

1:45:38.060 --> 1:45:40.140
 And then I haven't heard of them ever since.

1:45:40.140 --> 1:45:41.780
 But Firefox was a clever name.

1:45:41.780 --> 1:45:43.660
 We had to think of something distinctive.

1:45:43.660 --> 1:45:45.740
 We wanted to keep the fire going.

1:45:45.740 --> 1:45:48.180
 And it turns out there's a red panda, right?

1:45:48.180 --> 1:45:49.460
 That's the nickname for it.

1:45:49.460 --> 1:45:51.980
 So that's the second set of browser wars.

1:45:51.980 --> 1:45:56.980
 So how was Firefox born, how was Mozilla born?

1:45:59.660 --> 1:46:01.060
 There's a long story there too.

1:46:01.060 --> 1:46:02.980
 So Netscape got acquired by AOL,

1:46:02.980 --> 1:46:05.500
 which as I say was a reasonable happy ending

1:46:05.500 --> 1:46:06.580
 for a lot of people,

1:46:06.580 --> 1:46:08.500
 because Netscape otherwise was gonna go out of business

1:46:08.500 --> 1:46:10.740
 because Microsoft was just killing its market.

1:46:10.740 --> 1:46:12.540
 There was no way to charge for a browser.

1:46:12.540 --> 1:46:15.980
 Windows came with IE, IE4 was pretty good

1:46:15.980 --> 1:46:17.580
 and Netscape 4 wasn't that good.

1:46:17.580 --> 1:46:19.060
 It took a while to get better.

1:46:20.180 --> 1:46:22.340
 But the Netscape executive said,

1:46:22.340 --> 1:46:25.660
 let's do an open source escape pod.

1:46:25.660 --> 1:46:27.180
 And like in Star Wars, A New Hope,

1:46:27.180 --> 1:46:28.340
 the gunner won't shoot it

1:46:28.340 --> 1:46:30.180
 because there's no life forms on board, right?

1:46:30.180 --> 1:46:31.460
 It's not a threat.

1:46:31.460 --> 1:46:33.740
 And so we did Mozilla in 1998

1:46:33.740 --> 1:46:37.980
 and it looked like it was going to initially

1:46:37.980 --> 1:46:40.140
 just give the world an open source browser.

1:46:40.140 --> 1:46:42.020
 But it's really hard to get people to work

1:46:42.020 --> 1:46:43.900
 on this sort of hairball that had been hacked up

1:46:43.900 --> 1:46:46.100
 over by that point four years.

1:46:46.100 --> 1:46:49.140
 And it also couldn't have the crypto module

1:46:49.140 --> 1:46:51.020
 for secure sockets, so called,

1:46:51.020 --> 1:46:52.980
 or now transport layer security.

1:46:52.980 --> 1:46:54.380
 That was an electronic munition.

1:46:54.380 --> 1:46:56.100
 We were not allowed to release that

1:46:56.100 --> 1:47:00.460
 in the full 1024 bit key strength.

1:47:00.460 --> 1:47:05.100
 And yet people, one of whom I happened to meet previously

1:47:05.100 --> 1:47:08.980
 at SGI when I went on a sales support engineering trip,

1:47:08.980 --> 1:47:11.100
 Tim Hudson in Brisbane, Australia,

1:47:11.100 --> 1:47:16.100
 and Eric A. Young did what became open SSL.

1:47:16.460 --> 1:47:19.500
 It was called SSL EAY after Eric's initials.

1:47:19.500 --> 1:47:23.180
 And Tim and Eric took their open SSL

1:47:23.180 --> 1:47:25.420
 outside of the purview of the NSA

1:47:25.420 --> 1:47:27.300
 and the Department of Commerce,

1:47:27.300 --> 1:47:28.940
 and they stuck it into Mozilla's code.

1:47:28.940 --> 1:47:31.060
 And that was perhaps the best hack that was done

1:47:31.060 --> 1:47:34.540
 in the first few months after we open sourced the browser.

1:47:34.540 --> 1:47:35.420
 We had other problems.

1:47:35.420 --> 1:47:37.420
 The politics inside Netscape were riven

1:47:37.420 --> 1:47:38.340
 by these acquisitions.

1:47:38.340 --> 1:47:41.020
 So the one acquisition that kind of messed up Netscape

1:47:41.020 --> 1:47:44.340
 for also wanted to keep doing a proprietary mail

1:47:44.340 --> 1:47:48.860
 and groupware program, not Jamie Zawinski's mail program

1:47:48.860 --> 1:47:50.180
 that was in Netscape two and three.

1:47:50.180 --> 1:47:51.860
 And they held it back from open source.

1:47:51.860 --> 1:47:54.320
 We didn't have a mail program, it was just a browser.

1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:56.700
 We didn't know what AOL will do to us.

1:47:56.700 --> 1:47:59.260
 Turns out they didn't interfere with us for a long time.

1:47:59.260 --> 1:48:02.980
 But Netscape wasn't the best steward of Mozilla.

1:48:02.980 --> 1:48:05.340
 We were operating Mozilla as a pirate ship

1:48:05.340 --> 1:48:06.420
 without a legal entity.

1:48:06.420 --> 1:48:08.900
 So most of us worked for Netscape

1:48:08.900 --> 1:48:10.900
 under a separate organization.

1:48:10.900 --> 1:48:15.400
 And initially the first engineering manager,

1:48:15.400 --> 1:48:19.360
 Tom Paquin of Netscape was the Mozilla founding manager.

1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:20.820
 But he left pretty quickly

1:48:20.820 --> 1:48:23.120
 and he left me as the acting manager,

1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:25.500
 which is more like method acting in my case.

1:48:25.500 --> 1:48:28.780
 And that was my first management stint.

1:48:28.780 --> 1:48:32.140
 But then someone who'd written the licenses,

1:48:32.140 --> 1:48:34.100
 Mitchell Baker, she was a lawyer at Netscape.

1:48:34.100 --> 1:48:38.180
 She was involved in the open source license decision making

1:48:38.180 --> 1:48:40.380
 and the actual writing and construction of those licenses.

1:48:40.380 --> 1:48:42.980
 That was Mitchell's job, Netscape public license

1:48:42.980 --> 1:48:45.700
 and the truly open Mozilla public license.

1:48:45.700 --> 1:48:47.380
 And there were two because Netscape needed,

1:48:47.380 --> 1:48:49.580
 because of some encumbered code, needed some special rights

1:48:49.580 --> 1:48:51.100
 but that went away over time.

1:48:51.100 --> 1:48:52.820
 Mitchell was always interested in Mozilla

1:48:52.820 --> 1:48:54.220
 and she came back from maternity leave

1:48:54.220 --> 1:48:55.900
 and she said, I'll be the manager if you want.

1:48:55.900 --> 1:48:57.420
 And Jamie and I said, sure.

1:48:57.420 --> 1:48:59.380
 And then Jamie quit, he quit after a year.

1:48:59.380 --> 1:49:01.640
 He said, this didn't work, I'm sorry.

1:49:02.580 --> 1:49:04.340
 He acted like it was a total failure

1:49:04.340 --> 1:49:08.100
 because Mozilla didn't restart the browser market.

1:49:08.100 --> 1:49:09.260
 But there's no way it could have, right?

1:49:09.260 --> 1:49:13.740
 Netscape was still shipping variants of Netscape 4,

1:49:13.740 --> 1:49:15.700
 which was based on the old code.

1:49:15.700 --> 1:49:18.360
 Mozilla was trying to react to the code

1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:19.860
 to make greenfield for developers.

1:49:19.860 --> 1:49:20.900
 So it was one of my big goals.

1:49:20.900 --> 1:49:24.180
 It wasn't a technical goal so much as again, a social goal.

1:49:24.180 --> 1:49:26.380
 People wanted a more standard spaced browser.

1:49:26.380 --> 1:49:29.380
 They wanted less of a hairball that had been hacked on

1:49:29.380 --> 1:49:32.020
 by ex grad students starting four years prior.

1:49:32.020 --> 1:49:35.100
 So we said, we're gonna make a modular code base.

1:49:35.100 --> 1:49:37.500
 We're gonna use a variant or an open source version

1:49:37.500 --> 1:49:39.980
 of Microsoft's component object model,

1:49:39.980 --> 1:49:43.420
 has reference counting and standardized V tables,

1:49:43.420 --> 1:49:45.180
 virtual calls and C++.

1:49:45.180 --> 1:49:47.300
 And we're gonna use JavaScript.

1:49:47.300 --> 1:49:48.700
 We're gonna have a bridge between those two

1:49:48.700 --> 1:49:50.140
 so you can script those components

1:49:50.140 --> 1:49:51.560
 just like Java components.

1:49:52.780 --> 1:49:54.800
 We're going to make a portable front end

1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:57.220
 with a markup language for the user interface.

1:49:57.220 --> 1:50:00.380
 Not tables, not HTML, but custom menus

1:50:00.380 --> 1:50:02.880
 and dropdowns and toolbars.

1:50:02.880 --> 1:50:06.060
 And that was called Zool, XML user interface language.

1:50:06.060 --> 1:50:08.220
 And some real talent on the Netscape side delivered that.

1:50:08.220 --> 1:50:11.320
 Dave Hyatt, who was instrumental in Zool,

1:50:11.320 --> 1:50:15.700
 Chris Watterson, Joe Hewitt, Blake Ross.

1:50:15.700 --> 1:50:17.820
 And Blake was an intern.

1:50:17.820 --> 1:50:20.500
 He was like a high school aged intern at Netscape.

1:50:20.500 --> 1:50:23.920
 And at some point we were innovating rapidly

1:50:23.920 --> 1:50:26.960
 in the Mozilla world and Netscape was still caught up

1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:29.340
 in this management mess from these acquisitions

1:50:29.340 --> 1:50:30.420
 and it wasn't delivering.

1:50:30.420 --> 1:50:32.800
 And every year they were wondering if ALO was gonna come

1:50:32.800 --> 1:50:34.260
 and start beheading the executives

1:50:34.260 --> 1:50:36.100
 because it didn't do anything useful.

1:50:36.100 --> 1:50:36.940
 And there was this thought

1:50:36.940 --> 1:50:38.940
 you should take the Netscape browser engine

1:50:38.940 --> 1:50:40.740
 and put it in the Windows ALO client,

1:50:40.740 --> 1:50:41.980
 which was the dial up client

1:50:41.980 --> 1:50:45.420
 that all the increasingly aging users of ALO were using.

1:50:45.420 --> 1:50:46.260
 Never happened.

1:50:46.260 --> 1:50:48.140
 It would have been too big a change.

1:50:48.140 --> 1:50:49.820
 So it wasn't clear why ALO bought Netscape,

1:50:49.820 --> 1:50:50.940
 but as I said, they left it alone.

1:50:50.940 --> 1:50:53.300
 But Netscape didn't leave Mozilla alone.

1:50:53.300 --> 1:50:58.300
 And so in 2001, Mitchell called me up and said,

1:50:58.780 --> 1:50:59.820
 I'm no longer employed.

1:50:59.820 --> 1:51:00.660
 And I was like, what?

1:51:00.660 --> 1:51:01.480
 You quit?

1:51:01.480 --> 1:51:02.320
 No, no, this wasn't my choice.

1:51:02.320 --> 1:51:05.300
 And there was a layoff which maybe accidentally

1:51:05.300 --> 1:51:06.820
 or on purpose got rid of Mitchell.

1:51:06.820 --> 1:51:08.660
 But the funny thing was we had an open source project.

1:51:08.660 --> 1:51:11.220
 We had a lot of the engineers on staff on our side

1:51:11.220 --> 1:51:15.220
 and we had people we'd hired through the Mozilla community

1:51:15.220 --> 1:51:16.300
 who were top notch.

1:51:16.300 --> 1:51:19.260
 They'd risen, they came in high quality, they knew the code

1:51:19.260 --> 1:51:21.660
 and they actually were better than the average

1:51:21.660 --> 1:51:23.340
 or median hire of Netscape.

1:51:23.340 --> 1:51:26.940
 And so the funny thing was the executive

1:51:26.940 --> 1:51:29.940
 who thought they'd gotten rid of Mitchell in the layoff

1:51:29.940 --> 1:51:32.700
 on the next week's community call around Mozilla

1:51:32.700 --> 1:51:35.220
 and what to do, there's Mitchell.

1:51:35.220 --> 1:51:36.820
 And so this showed you can kind of transcend

1:51:36.820 --> 1:51:40.420
 your boundaries of corporate open source

1:51:40.420 --> 1:51:42.700
 if you get a project that has enough loyalty,

1:51:42.700 --> 1:51:43.820
 even among the paid staff.

1:51:43.820 --> 1:51:45.580
 Because we had outside people contributing.

1:51:45.580 --> 1:51:47.980
 We had people at Red Hat and a few other places,

1:51:47.980 --> 1:51:50.620
 but the majority of the hackers were employed by Netscape.

1:51:50.620 --> 1:51:53.380
 But a lot of them at that point had come from the community

1:51:53.380 --> 1:51:55.820
 and others got the community and wanted to work with it.

1:51:55.820 --> 1:51:57.900
 And it was really the weakest engineers at Netscape

1:51:57.900 --> 1:52:01.100
 who didn't like Mozilla and didn't like the crucible

1:52:01.100 --> 1:52:04.220
 of competing with the better programmers.

1:52:04.220 --> 1:52:06.640
 So if the project is good enough, it will rise,

1:52:06.640 --> 1:52:08.220
 the Phoenix will rise out of the...

1:52:08.220 --> 1:52:09.060
 That's exactly right.

1:52:09.060 --> 1:52:10.880
 And so we had this Mozilla code base

1:52:10.880 --> 1:52:11.720
 that was getting better.

1:52:11.720 --> 1:52:13.540
 In fact, I think at some point in 2002

1:52:13.540 --> 1:52:17.380
 when we declared Mozilla 1.0, I engineered a roadmap

1:52:17.380 --> 1:52:20.100
 that successively through similar sort of six week,

1:52:20.100 --> 1:52:23.000
 five week releases, like we all do with browser releases

1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:26.460
 nowadays, Chrome does and Firefox braved us three weeks.

1:52:26.460 --> 1:52:29.700
 We got to a point where we said, you know what?

1:52:29.700 --> 1:52:30.540
 It doesn't suck.

1:52:30.540 --> 1:52:33.240
 This is like the 1.0 that you want to release

1:52:33.240 --> 1:52:35.340
 because if you hold it back any longer to polish it,

1:52:35.340 --> 1:52:36.980
 you're denying others the ability to use it.

1:52:36.980 --> 1:52:39.400
 It's like pro engineer, the mechanical CAD tool

1:52:39.400 --> 1:52:43.660
 embedded the code, they embedded the layout engine.

1:52:43.660 --> 1:52:46.980
 And Mozilla 1.0 was like a Netscape communication suite.

1:52:46.980 --> 1:52:49.560
 We had at that point gotten male people

1:52:49.560 --> 1:52:53.640
 to reintegrate mail and news and we had an editor for HTML.

1:52:53.640 --> 1:52:56.620
 And it felt like a 90s suite, suiteware.

1:52:57.620 --> 1:52:58.800
 And it felt kind of bloated.

1:52:58.800 --> 1:53:02.140
 And the people who were taking that Mozilla open source

1:53:02.140 --> 1:53:05.020
 and then adding Netscape flavor to it

1:53:05.020 --> 1:53:06.540
 were not calling the shots right.

1:53:06.540 --> 1:53:08.460
 And they were also under AOL's thumb a little bit

1:53:08.460 --> 1:53:10.540
 and that they said, well, we should probably put

1:53:10.540 --> 1:53:13.180
 the AOL instant messenger chicklet on the toolbar.

1:53:13.180 --> 1:53:16.220
 We should put the ICQ, the other messaging system

1:53:16.220 --> 1:53:17.340
 that AOL had acquired.

1:53:17.340 --> 1:53:19.580
 We should put the ICQ button on the toolbar.

1:53:19.580 --> 1:53:23.500
 And pretty soon Netscape looked like a bit of a NASCAR

1:53:23.500 --> 1:53:24.900
 badged version of Mozilla.

1:53:24.900 --> 1:53:27.180
 And that also made Mozilla more popular.

1:53:27.180 --> 1:53:32.180
 And yet they had contrived to fire or lay off the leader

1:53:35.460 --> 1:53:38.540
 and we carried on with an open source structure

1:53:38.540 --> 1:53:40.860
 where Mozilla was still, you know, Mitchell was calling

1:53:40.860 --> 1:53:44.480
 sort of management or project level shots

1:53:44.480 --> 1:53:46.100
 and I was calling technical shots.

1:53:46.100 --> 1:53:51.100
 And we had a popular suite, but we thought,

1:53:51.200 --> 1:53:52.740
 why not make it just a browser?

1:53:52.740 --> 1:53:55.380
 Because it'll be simpler, it'll do one job well.

1:53:55.380 --> 1:53:58.780
 And even then we can strip it down by having extensions.

1:53:58.780 --> 1:54:03.740
 So Dave Hyatt and Blake Ross, the high school aged intern

1:54:03.740 --> 1:54:07.260
 did the first version, which was called Mozilla slash browser.

1:54:07.260 --> 1:54:09.220
 It was very, the small group of us, Ian Hicks

1:54:09.220 --> 1:54:14.220
 and Asa Dotzler, me and Joe Hewitt and Hyatt and Blake.

1:54:14.340 --> 1:54:16.540
 And Hyatt was really the senior hacker.

1:54:16.540 --> 1:54:20.500
 He'd done all these things like amazing cross platform menus

1:54:20.500 --> 1:54:23.500
 through the user interface, markup language.

1:54:23.500 --> 1:54:24.740
 And he knew how to do tab browsing.

1:54:24.740 --> 1:54:28.260
 He'd implemented it natively on Mac OS at the time

1:54:28.260 --> 1:54:31.740
 in Camino originally called Chimera.

1:54:31.740 --> 1:54:34.300
 He'd written multiple implementations,

1:54:34.300 --> 1:54:36.340
 which was a thing programmers should do.

1:54:36.340 --> 1:54:38.440
 It's like the V8 team did for those missing years

1:54:38.440 --> 1:54:40.980
 when the rest of the Chrome team's like, where's V8?

1:54:41.980 --> 1:54:44.440
 In fact, Dave's wife, Rebecca told me a story

1:54:44.440 --> 1:54:45.860
 about when they were at UIUC,

1:54:45.860 --> 1:54:49.460
 they were also University of Illinois grad students.

1:54:49.460 --> 1:54:51.300
 There was an assignment, it was a programming assignment

1:54:51.300 --> 1:54:53.300
 it was supposed to do at the end of the semester.

1:54:53.300 --> 1:54:56.820
 And Dave's friend was this, I'm gonna go think

1:54:56.820 --> 1:54:59.460
 and I'm gonna design and I'm gonna make this

1:54:59.460 --> 1:55:01.300
 platonic perfect form of the program.

1:55:01.300 --> 1:55:03.580
 And then I'm gonna write it at the end when it's due.

1:55:03.580 --> 1:55:05.140
 And Hyatt just went there and started hacking.

1:55:05.140 --> 1:55:06.660
 He wrote one version, he wrote a second version,

1:55:06.660 --> 1:55:09.220
 a third version, end of the semester comes around.

1:55:09.220 --> 1:55:11.140
 The friend's not doing too well.

1:55:11.140 --> 1:55:13.000
 It wasn't perfect and it wasn't written.

1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:14.820
 I'm not sure how that story ended for him,

1:55:14.820 --> 1:55:18.100
 but Dave's version was a fifth iteration, it was great.

1:55:18.100 --> 1:55:20.700
 And so he'd done that with everything you need

1:55:20.700 --> 1:55:21.700
 in a tabbed browser.

1:55:21.700 --> 1:55:24.360
 And this really showed well in Phoenix,

1:55:24.360 --> 1:55:28.120
 what we called Phoenix and I had to rename two more times.

1:55:28.120 --> 1:55:32.260
 And Blake went to Stanford, he became a Stanford student

1:55:32.260 --> 1:55:34.060
 and couldn't work on it.

1:55:34.060 --> 1:55:36.620
 Dave Hyatt went to Apple in 2001.

1:55:36.620 --> 1:55:39.580
 He was one of the founding Safari team members.

1:55:39.580 --> 1:55:40.460
 Interesting, wow.

1:55:40.460 --> 1:55:43.540
 But he was still blogging about tabbed browsing.

1:55:43.540 --> 1:55:44.860
 I think Apple at some point said you should.

1:55:44.860 --> 1:55:46.140
 Safari have tabbed browsing?

1:55:46.140 --> 1:55:48.220
 Yeah, but it was because of Hyatt.

1:55:48.220 --> 1:55:49.820
 Hyatt was quite a feather in their cap.

1:55:49.820 --> 1:55:53.420
 Don Melton, who had been the engineering manager

1:55:53.420 --> 1:55:56.540
 for Safari from the beginning, had been in Netscape also.

1:55:56.540 --> 1:55:58.980
 And so there's this diaspora of talent

1:55:58.980 --> 1:56:01.620
 and yet Hyatt was still kind of writing blog posts

1:56:01.620 --> 1:56:03.260
 about how to do tabs right.

1:56:03.260 --> 1:56:05.360
 And at some point Apple said, don't blog about that.

1:56:05.360 --> 1:56:07.580
 That's our proprietary tab technology.

1:56:07.580 --> 1:56:08.620
 And I was like, no, it's not.

1:56:08.620 --> 1:56:10.580
 It was an opera and I've refined it.

1:56:10.580 --> 1:56:15.420
 So we had to replace people and we had Ben Goodger,

1:56:15.420 --> 1:56:18.020
 a New Zealander we hired at Netscape.

1:56:18.020 --> 1:56:21.260
 And he stepped in to be the Firefox lead.

1:56:21.260 --> 1:56:23.340
 And we also had this weird circumstance

1:56:23.340 --> 1:56:26.900
 where AOL finally did notice that Netscape

1:56:26.900 --> 1:56:28.380
 was kind of an albatross,

1:56:28.380 --> 1:56:31.060
 that they bought it for no particular benefit.

1:56:31.060 --> 1:56:33.820
 And even then the AOL politics were also heinous,

1:56:33.820 --> 1:56:35.380
 sort of East Coast politics.

1:56:35.380 --> 1:56:36.660
 I remember taking two trips there

1:56:36.660 --> 1:56:37.820
 because I was a principal engineer.

1:56:37.820 --> 1:56:39.560
 And so us principal engineers got trotted out

1:56:39.560 --> 1:56:42.740
 to do dog and pony shows in Dallas, Virginia.

1:56:42.740 --> 1:56:46.400
 And the AOL opera management was very East Coast in flavor.

1:56:46.400 --> 1:56:49.100
 And they were at that time merging with Time Warner,

1:56:49.100 --> 1:56:50.500
 which did not go well.

1:56:50.500 --> 1:56:52.020
 So one of these years we went out there

1:56:52.020 --> 1:56:53.420
 and we were all doing dog and pony shows

1:56:53.420 --> 1:56:55.100
 and there were these characters

1:56:55.100 --> 1:56:56.340
 that were sort of like marketing guys.

1:56:56.340 --> 1:56:57.700
 One of them was wearing a cravat

1:56:57.700 --> 1:56:59.460
 and one was named Reggie.

1:56:59.460 --> 1:57:04.460
 And they were very you rather than non you.

1:57:05.940 --> 1:57:07.480
 Or they were like what's what's Stoneman's

1:57:07.480 --> 1:57:12.480
 metropolitan film, UHB, urban haute bourgeoisie.

1:57:13.980 --> 1:57:15.820
 They were haute bourgeoisie.

1:57:15.820 --> 1:57:19.100
 They were funny and they were kind of useless

1:57:19.100 --> 1:57:20.140
 and kind of preppy.

1:57:20.140 --> 1:57:21.460
 And then the next year we went back

1:57:21.460 --> 1:57:22.340
 and I said, where's Reggie?

1:57:22.340 --> 1:57:24.140
 And it's like, oh, Reggie's not here anymore

1:57:24.140 --> 1:57:26.300
 because Time Warner realized that the merger

1:57:26.300 --> 1:57:27.520
 wasn't in their interest either.

1:57:27.520 --> 1:57:29.140
 And then the sort of knives came out.

1:57:29.140 --> 1:57:31.820
 And these mergers rarely work, right?

1:57:31.820 --> 1:57:32.680
 This is very difficult.

1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:33.820
 You get these giant companies

1:57:33.820 --> 1:57:35.300
 and they think there's gonna be synergy.

1:57:35.300 --> 1:57:37.540
 That was the 90s, late 90s watch word.

1:57:37.540 --> 1:57:39.340
 And there wasn't synergy with AOL buying Netscape

1:57:39.340 --> 1:57:41.260
 and there wasn't synergy with Time Warner and AOL.

1:57:41.260 --> 1:57:43.020
 But did AOL ever really work?

1:57:43.020 --> 1:57:44.260
 Was it ever really cool?

1:57:44.260 --> 1:57:46.460
 Like the same kind of fire and excitement

1:57:46.460 --> 1:57:48.740
 that Firefox eventually created,

1:57:48.740 --> 1:57:51.100
 was that ever there in AOL?

1:57:51.100 --> 1:57:55.020
 AOL was the right time to do a dial up service

1:57:55.020 --> 1:57:56.660
 that got distribution by basically

1:57:56.660 --> 1:58:00.700
 leaflet bombing compact discs on the country.

1:58:00.700 --> 1:58:04.420
 And they beat out CompuServe and the other ones,

1:58:04.420 --> 1:58:06.860
 Prodigy, and then the web happened.

1:58:06.860 --> 1:58:10.940
 And so you had almost like this isolated continent,

1:58:10.940 --> 1:58:14.180
 like some of the evolutionary biologists I follow

1:58:14.180 --> 1:58:19.180
 make fun of the funny large marsupial mammals of Australia,

1:58:19.900 --> 1:58:21.500
 how silly they are.

1:58:21.500 --> 1:58:23.100
 And so AOL is like Australia.

1:58:23.100 --> 1:58:23.940
 Yeah.

1:58:23.940 --> 1:58:26.420
 And you saw it over time because they kept aging

1:58:26.420 --> 1:58:28.180
 and they were using AOL to get online

1:58:28.180 --> 1:58:30.440
 and they couldn't really use a web browser.

1:58:30.440 --> 1:58:33.380
 And it became sort of a valued cohort

1:58:33.380 --> 1:58:35.140
 because they still have relatively high

1:58:35.140 --> 1:58:37.200
 socioeconomic status and they have grandchildren,

1:58:37.200 --> 1:58:39.500
 but it's going away, it's dying at some point.

1:58:39.500 --> 1:58:42.100
 Towards the end of the aughts, that decade,

1:58:42.100 --> 1:58:45.980
 and then to the decade 2010 plus,

1:58:45.980 --> 1:58:48.620
 that Firefox became this incredible,

1:58:48.620 --> 1:58:50.260
 I forget when Chrome came out, but.

1:58:50.260 --> 1:58:51.100
 2008, September.

1:58:51.100 --> 1:58:55.060
 2008, but Firefox was the sexy cool thing

1:58:55.060 --> 1:58:57.500
 that represented a lot of the cutting edge technologies

1:58:57.500 --> 1:58:58.340
 and all that kind of stuff.

1:58:58.340 --> 1:59:00.140
 Web 2, it was amazing.

1:59:00.140 --> 1:59:03.380
 Kim O'reilly and John Battelle did the first Web 2 conference

1:59:03.380 --> 1:59:05.420
 which eventually became huge and they split it.

1:59:05.420 --> 1:59:08.540
 But that was in 2004, it was right when Firefox was out.

1:59:08.540 --> 1:59:11.640
 Craigslist was huge, it was killing classified revenue

1:59:11.640 --> 1:59:14.420
 for newspapers, but there was just this ferment.

1:59:14.420 --> 1:59:15.260
 People starting.

1:59:15.260 --> 1:59:16.660
 Wikipedia along there somewhere.

1:59:16.660 --> 1:59:19.820
 Gmail was already done and it was an impressive web mail.

1:59:19.820 --> 1:59:21.140
 There were others before it like Hotmail,

1:59:21.140 --> 1:59:22.860
 but Gmail was really impressive from Google.

1:59:22.860 --> 1:59:26.020
 And Google Maps, people started seeing what could be done.

1:59:26.020 --> 1:59:28.100
 They thought how can you drag the map around

1:59:28.100 --> 1:59:29.700
 and how does that work?

1:59:29.700 --> 1:59:32.460
 And it was all JavaScript and images and.

1:59:32.460 --> 1:59:34.500
 So Gmail was 2003, four?

1:59:34.500 --> 1:59:36.220
 Yeah, it actually started quite early.

1:59:36.220 --> 1:59:37.340
 It might've been 2002 or three,

1:59:37.340 --> 1:59:40.100
 but by the time we started dealing with Google and Firefox

1:59:40.100 --> 1:59:41.040
 to get the search deal,

1:59:41.040 --> 1:59:43.420
 which was the main revenue source for Mozilla,

1:59:43.420 --> 1:59:47.740
 and still is, 2004, early, Sergey Brinz,

1:59:47.740 --> 1:59:50.420
 one of his trusted engineer guys, Fritz Schneider,

1:59:50.420 --> 1:59:53.380
 made contact with me at Mozilla and we started talking

1:59:53.380 --> 1:59:56.980
 and we realized search and browser need each other.

1:59:56.980 --> 1:59:58.460
 And this is deeply true, right?

1:59:58.460 --> 1:59:59.780
 This is still true.

1:59:59.780 --> 2:00:01.140
 This is why a lot of the search engines

2:00:01.140 --> 2:00:02.240
 have their own browsers.

2:00:02.240 --> 2:00:03.660
 Yeah, so in case people don't know,

2:00:03.660 --> 2:00:05.580
 the main revenue source for the browser

2:00:05.580 --> 2:00:07.240
 is the default search engine,

2:00:07.240 --> 2:00:09.260
 which is kind of incredible to think about

2:00:09.260 --> 2:00:11.460
 that that is a revenue source.

2:00:11.460 --> 2:00:12.580
 It's a little bit sad.

2:00:12.580 --> 2:00:14.580
 Yeah, it leads to this capture or kill effect

2:00:14.580 --> 2:00:17.020
 where you have the search engine own its own browser

2:00:17.020 --> 2:00:21.260
 and other browsers may struggle to get the distribution

2:00:21.260 --> 2:00:22.620
 we talked about earlier.

2:00:22.620 --> 2:00:26.800
 So where, and you said you've figured out

2:00:26.800 --> 2:00:29.100
 that Google is working on its own browser

2:00:29.100 --> 2:00:29.940
 at some point there.

2:00:29.940 --> 2:00:30.780
 2006, yeah.

2:00:30.780 --> 2:00:33.220
 2006, so would you say Firefox versus,

2:00:33.220 --> 2:00:35.380
 was Internet Explorer part of the war here

2:00:35.380 --> 2:00:37.300
 or was the Firefox versus Chrome?

2:00:37.300 --> 2:00:40.900
 So Firefox didn't quite cause Microsoft to reconvene IE.

2:00:40.900 --> 2:00:44.580
 They did do IE7 and I remember being on a plane

2:00:44.580 --> 2:00:46.220
 back from the standards meeting,

2:00:46.220 --> 2:00:48.980
 JavaScript standards meeting from Seattle, from Redmond,

2:00:48.980 --> 2:00:52.100
 and there was some Microsoft guy in front of me.

2:00:52.100 --> 2:00:54.940
 Turns out my wife knew him from her past life

2:00:54.940 --> 2:00:58.200
 before we married and he was just this bearded big guy

2:00:58.200 --> 2:00:59.040
 and he was like,

2:00:59.040 --> 2:01:01.500
 we should have just killed Firefox in the cradle.

2:01:01.500 --> 2:01:04.160
 All we needed to do was add pop up blocking in tabs

2:01:04.160 --> 2:01:06.180
 and we could have made Internet Explorer kill Firefox.

2:01:06.180 --> 2:01:07.820
 And it's like, shoulda, coulda, woulda, pal.

2:01:07.820 --> 2:01:10.300
 And I was right behind him during this.

2:01:10.300 --> 2:01:11.580
 But they didn't, they were slow

2:01:11.580 --> 2:01:13.540
 and IE7 wasn't that great.

2:01:13.540 --> 2:01:18.440
 And what really got them started I think was Chrome.

2:01:18.440 --> 2:01:21.500
 And I talked to Larry Page in 2005,

2:01:21.500 --> 2:01:24.500
 I think I said, we're talking about the Firefox relationship

2:01:24.500 --> 2:01:26.120
 but he was also saying, what about WebKit?

2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:31.120
 This was Apple's version of the old KHTML engine from Linux,

2:01:32.020 --> 2:01:35.780
 the KDE side of Linux that was used in the Conqueror browser

2:01:35.780 --> 2:01:38.140
 also with Ks that Apple had forked.

2:01:38.140 --> 2:01:41.700
 And in 2005 was when Apple's principals

2:01:41.700 --> 2:01:43.400
 including Dave Hyatt, Maciej Stokowiak,

2:01:43.400 --> 2:01:45.580
 some of my friends who are still there said,

2:01:45.580 --> 2:01:48.540
 we must stop patch bombing this poor KHTML project.

2:01:48.540 --> 2:01:50.900
 We should make a proper Mozilla like organization,

2:01:50.900 --> 2:01:51.780
 webkit.org.

2:01:51.780 --> 2:01:53.700
 Now it wasn't a separate nonprofit or anything.

2:01:53.700 --> 2:01:55.220
 It was still Apple, it was Apple controlled

2:01:55.220 --> 2:01:58.180
 but they made their fork first class

2:01:58.180 --> 2:02:00.500
 and they made it be something that they all worked in

2:02:00.500 --> 2:02:01.340
 and lived in.

2:02:01.340 --> 2:02:03.040
 And that was before Chrome.

2:02:03.040 --> 2:02:05.660
 And then Chrome, Larry Page said, what about WebKit?

2:02:05.660 --> 2:02:06.540
 I said, yeah, it's nice.

2:02:06.540 --> 2:02:08.000
 I have friends who work on it.

2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:09.560
 You might use that if you do your own browser.

2:02:09.560 --> 2:02:10.460
 Why don't you do your own browser?

2:02:10.460 --> 2:02:11.980
 Don't worry about Firefox.

2:02:11.980 --> 2:02:12.940
 You should do your own browser.

2:02:12.940 --> 2:02:15.260
 You can have your own opinion of how it should work.

2:02:15.260 --> 2:02:17.060
 And sure enough they did.

2:02:17.060 --> 2:02:19.180
 So by 2006, we knew they'd been working on it.

2:02:19.180 --> 2:02:21.320
 Some of my friends who'd been at Netscape

2:02:21.320 --> 2:02:22.420
 did the original demo.

2:02:22.420 --> 2:02:24.020
 And the demo wasn't what you thought.

2:02:24.020 --> 2:02:25.340
 It didn't have the fast JavaScript yet.

2:02:25.340 --> 2:02:28.520
 That was still off in Denmark on a farm.

2:02:29.540 --> 2:02:30.500
 Did it have tabs?

2:02:30.500 --> 2:02:32.820
 It had tabs because all browsers had tabs at this point.

2:02:32.820 --> 2:02:37.460
 And it had this software fault isolation I mentioned.

2:02:37.460 --> 2:02:39.060
 It was through process isolation.

2:02:39.060 --> 2:02:43.560
 So in theory, each tab has some operating system process.

2:02:43.560 --> 2:02:45.580
 And so what's gonna take your tab down?

2:02:45.580 --> 2:02:48.380
 Well, WebKit has bugs that can crash it

2:02:48.380 --> 2:02:49.880
 but Flash was still big then.

2:02:49.880 --> 2:02:51.220
 All the restaurant sites remember.

2:02:51.220 --> 2:02:53.100
 And Flash crashed a lot.

2:02:53.100 --> 2:02:55.020
 So the demo that I heard about,

2:02:55.020 --> 2:02:57.980
 my friends at Netscape as a lot of people did,

2:02:57.980 --> 2:03:00.460
 inside Google was the sad tab.

2:03:00.460 --> 2:03:02.120
 They showed an early version of Chrome

2:03:02.120 --> 2:03:04.200
 which is just this bare bones tab browser.

2:03:04.200 --> 2:03:06.700
 They loaded a site with a known Flash volume

2:03:06.700 --> 2:03:08.540
 and then suddenly Flash crashes.

2:03:08.540 --> 2:03:10.860
 And everyone expected the whole browser to go down.

2:03:10.860 --> 2:03:13.080
 But instead you got this little sad face in the tab

2:03:13.080 --> 2:03:14.740
 and you could reload it and there it is again.

2:03:14.740 --> 2:03:16.740
 So this was an improvement.

2:03:16.740 --> 2:03:18.740
 It was a real move for security.

2:03:18.740 --> 2:03:21.420
 It was based on a company they acquired

2:03:21.420 --> 2:03:22.660
 called Green Border.

2:03:22.660 --> 2:03:25.060
 They had some really big brains like Olfar Erlingsson

2:03:25.060 --> 2:03:25.880
 I think was involved.

2:03:25.880 --> 2:03:28.880
 And they had done some exotic security stuff

2:03:28.880 --> 2:03:32.180
 but they ended up simplifying it to this process isolation.

2:03:32.180 --> 2:03:34.960
 And it was good.

2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:36.740
 And Firefox didn't have it at the time.

2:03:36.740 --> 2:03:39.700
 So we were still struggling with security bugs.

2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:42.980
 So we knew Chrome was coming

2:03:42.980 --> 2:03:45.060
 but it took two more years to come out.

2:03:45.060 --> 2:03:48.300
 And we were still getting the Google search revenue

2:03:48.300 --> 2:03:51.860
 and we were still making Google the default engine

2:03:51.860 --> 2:03:52.980
 and Firefox was still growing.

2:03:52.980 --> 2:03:55.260
 Firefox grew I think until 2011.

2:03:55.260 --> 2:03:56.900
 That was when it peaked.

2:03:56.900 --> 2:03:59.900
 And as it started falling, it was because of Chrome.

2:03:59.900 --> 2:04:02.900
 Chrome came out in 2008 and it had a comic book

2:04:02.900 --> 2:04:04.820
 that leaked accidentally that showed some of the people

2:04:04.820 --> 2:04:05.660
 who worked on it.

2:04:05.660 --> 2:04:07.260
 Lars Bock was in there and so on.

2:04:07.260 --> 2:04:08.980
 It was kind of soft launch

2:04:08.980 --> 2:04:10.380
 because they didn't market it heavily.

2:04:10.380 --> 2:04:12.580
 They didn't push distribution.

2:04:12.580 --> 2:04:14.820
 But Google had reason to worry about distribution

2:04:14.820 --> 2:04:19.220
 because Microsoft was doing a search engine, Bing,

2:04:19.220 --> 2:04:20.500
 since 2007.

2:04:20.500 --> 2:04:22.020
 In fact, when they came out with Bing,

2:04:22.020 --> 2:04:25.220
 Google was worried that Microsoft would just brute force

2:04:25.220 --> 2:04:28.540
 switch the default browser in everyone's Internet Explorer

2:04:28.540 --> 2:04:32.580
 or even Firefox on Windows to Bing from Google.

2:04:32.580 --> 2:04:34.860
 And Microsoft wasn't I think ready

2:04:34.860 --> 2:04:37.100
 to dare the antitrust cops that way

2:04:37.100 --> 2:04:39.020
 even though they'd gone to sleep.

2:04:39.020 --> 2:04:42.020
 And I don't think Bing was ready either.

2:04:42.020 --> 2:04:45.500
 But just in case it happened, Sundar Pichai,

2:04:45.500 --> 2:04:47.740
 who rose very well based on this work,

2:04:47.740 --> 2:04:50.580
 was sort of in charge of getting distribution deals.

2:04:50.580 --> 2:04:52.180
 And he got Google toolbar

2:04:52.180 --> 2:04:55.500
 and Google desktop search distribution.

2:04:55.500 --> 2:04:56.780
 And if you remember those pieces of software,

2:04:56.780 --> 2:04:59.460
 those were like desktop extensions,

2:04:59.460 --> 2:05:01.940
 toolbars or operating system extensions

2:05:01.940 --> 2:05:03.820
 for doing desktop search, searching your local files.

2:05:03.820 --> 2:05:05.900
 Kind of like Mac OS Spotlight, right?

2:05:05.900 --> 2:05:07.300
 Sadly, it died.

2:05:07.300 --> 2:05:08.140
 It all died.

2:05:08.140 --> 2:05:09.220
 And there were some features that we still missed

2:05:09.220 --> 2:05:10.580
 that didn't make it into Chrome.

2:05:10.580 --> 2:05:14.020
 But Sundar got OEMs to bundle those.

2:05:14.020 --> 2:05:15.500
 And then he got enough of those deals

2:05:15.500 --> 2:05:18.000
 that by 2007 or eight, Google felt,

2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:20.500
 well, if Bing, Microsoft does the worst

2:05:20.500 --> 2:05:21.860
 and tries to force Bing,

2:05:21.860 --> 2:05:25.500
 we can reach in and reset it with that point of presence.

2:05:25.500 --> 2:05:27.340
 So that was good for Sundar's career

2:05:27.340 --> 2:05:28.180
 and it was good for Google,

2:05:28.180 --> 2:05:30.780
 but it never came to pass that they had to defend.

2:05:30.780 --> 2:05:32.940
 Microsoft was still slow.

2:05:32.940 --> 2:05:35.000
 And by the time they saw Chrome come out,

2:05:35.000 --> 2:05:37.420
 then they did what would have been IE9.

2:05:37.420 --> 2:05:38.260
 And then they said,

2:05:38.260 --> 2:05:39.500
 we're gonna have a fast JavaScript engine

2:05:39.500 --> 2:05:41.380
 to Chakra, Chakra core.

2:05:41.380 --> 2:05:43.140
 And they did okay.

2:05:43.140 --> 2:05:46.220
 They were another process isolated,

2:05:46.220 --> 2:05:48.980
 fast JavaScript browser, tab browser.

2:05:48.980 --> 2:05:52.340
 So it sounds like there's a deep fundamental coupling

2:05:52.340 --> 2:05:53.640
 of search engine and browser

2:05:53.640 --> 2:05:55.780
 that's mixing this whole thing up.

2:05:55.780 --> 2:05:59.980
 And obviously Firefox doesn't have a search engine.

2:05:59.980 --> 2:06:03.680
 That's like, I mean, you're partnering with somebody

2:06:03.680 --> 2:06:04.940
 with a search engine.

2:06:04.940 --> 2:06:08.780
 With Yahoo or with Google or so on.

2:06:08.780 --> 2:06:10.660
 They tried Yahoo, that was unfortunate

2:06:10.660 --> 2:06:14.660
 because I think even though Marissa Mayer talked about it,

2:06:14.660 --> 2:06:15.840
 she never pulled it off.

2:06:15.840 --> 2:06:18.620
 They never restored the search team

2:06:18.620 --> 2:06:19.600
 that had been laid off.

2:06:19.600 --> 2:06:21.460
 I believe Carol Bartz was running Yahoo

2:06:21.460 --> 2:06:23.100
 when Carol said, I've got to get rid

2:06:23.100 --> 2:06:24.580
 of one of the three expensive things.

2:06:24.580 --> 2:06:25.940
 I'm gonna get rid of search.

2:06:25.940 --> 2:06:29.800
 And those researchers went to Google and Microsoft

2:06:29.800 --> 2:06:32.500
 and there was no way to put Yahoo search back together.

2:06:32.500 --> 2:06:36.020
 So when Firefox tried switching all their users

2:06:36.020 --> 2:06:38.700
 who'd stuck with a default from Google to Yahoo,

2:06:38.700 --> 2:06:40.980
 it was like mid December, 2014,

2:06:40.980 --> 2:06:44.060
 a bunch of users said, what just happened to my Firefox?

2:06:44.060 --> 2:06:45.300
 And others didn't notice right away,

2:06:45.300 --> 2:06:46.220
 but over time they did.

2:06:46.220 --> 2:06:48.320
 And so over the next year,

2:06:48.320 --> 2:06:51.360
 the traffic just went away for Yahoo.

2:06:51.360 --> 2:06:54.420
 And yet they were obliged, I understand it.

2:06:54.420 --> 2:06:56.700
 I don't have inside knowledge, but this has leaked out

2:06:56.700 --> 2:06:58.340
 and Danny Sullivan's written about it,

2:06:58.340 --> 2:06:59.260
 search engine land.

2:06:59.260 --> 2:07:01.520
 I think the deal was like fixed payments to Mozilla.

2:07:01.520 --> 2:07:03.500
 So Mozilla was getting a bunch of money for traffic

2:07:03.500 --> 2:07:04.960
 that wasn't staying because users

2:07:04.960 --> 2:07:06.580
 were resetting their default.

2:07:06.580 --> 2:07:09.220
 And this shows how defaults are important,

2:07:09.220 --> 2:07:10.520
 but they have to be good enough

2:07:10.520 --> 2:07:12.580
 that the user doesn't override them.

2:07:12.580 --> 2:07:16.620
 And a lot of the commercial value in popular apps

2:07:16.620 --> 2:07:18.040
 is what are the default settings?

2:07:18.040 --> 2:07:20.120
 What is the default search?

2:07:20.120 --> 2:07:21.860
 But oftentimes there's something just like you said,

2:07:21.860 --> 2:07:25.020
 I mean, if there's something compelling

2:07:25.020 --> 2:07:27.220
 that's also can beat out the default,

2:07:27.220 --> 2:07:29.020
 like tab browsing and so on.

2:07:29.020 --> 2:07:32.300
 And that's where, I mean, we'll talk about brave browser.

2:07:32.300 --> 2:07:36.200
 It feels like now we're in this third stage

2:07:36.200 --> 2:07:41.200
 where there's a Chrome, Firefox, Edge,

2:07:41.440 --> 2:07:44.620
 I guess it's called and brave.

2:07:44.620 --> 2:07:48.500
 And these are all seem like really exciting,

2:07:48.500 --> 2:07:50.560
 I don't know, innovative browsers.

2:07:50.560 --> 2:07:52.260
 They're all kind of copying off of each other,

2:07:52.260 --> 2:07:53.760
 picking up the good stuff.

2:07:53.760 --> 2:07:56.260
 There's evolution again, especially on tracking protection.

2:07:56.260 --> 2:08:00.260
 So privacy is this sort of global wave that's rising.

2:08:02.500 --> 2:08:04.820
 I like to call it a wave because it's a large,

2:08:04.820 --> 2:08:07.020
 somewhat chaotic structure.

2:08:07.020 --> 2:08:08.600
 It's not a unitary good.

2:08:08.600 --> 2:08:11.780
 You can't say I'm buying privacy for $3,

2:08:11.780 --> 2:08:12.740
 I'm paying $3 privacy.

2:08:12.740 --> 2:08:14.300
 Some people think a VPN does this

2:08:14.300 --> 2:08:15.980
 and are disappointed when it fails them.

2:08:15.980 --> 2:08:19.700
 But often people use VPNs for region unlocking video

2:08:19.700 --> 2:08:21.460
 or getting the US Netflix catalog.

2:08:22.860 --> 2:08:25.380
 But privacy is not a unitary good, it's complex

2:08:25.380 --> 2:08:28.060
 and people are understanding it only over time

2:08:28.060 --> 2:08:30.700
 and as they get burned, but there's a genie

2:08:30.700 --> 2:08:31.980
 that's not going back in the bottle there.

2:08:31.980 --> 2:08:33.380
 People are fed up.

2:08:33.380 --> 2:08:34.700
 Apple has responded to this.

2:08:34.700 --> 2:08:36.620
 Apple was always making Safari, I think,

2:08:36.620 --> 2:08:40.340
 more of a privacy branded browser from the very beginning.

2:08:40.340 --> 2:08:42.300
 I think this was probably Steve Jobs.

2:08:42.300 --> 2:08:45.260
 Safari had private windows, private tabs

2:08:45.260 --> 2:08:48.220
 before Firefox did.

2:08:48.220 --> 2:08:50.060
 And these are only private in the sense

2:08:50.060 --> 2:08:53.020
 that they don't leave local traces,

2:08:53.020 --> 2:08:53.980
 if you don't want them to.

2:08:53.980 --> 2:08:57.180
 Turns out Safari does keep them around between shutdown.

2:08:57.180 --> 2:08:59.860
 But the canonical model is no local traces

2:08:59.860 --> 2:09:01.780
 after you close the private window.

2:09:01.780 --> 2:09:04.900
 No leftover traces that you went to some site

2:09:04.900 --> 2:09:06.140
 that you were embarrassed by

2:09:06.140 --> 2:09:08.980
 or bought a gift for somebody you wanted to keep secret.

2:09:10.220 --> 2:09:11.780
 But there's still some level of tracking.

2:09:11.780 --> 2:09:14.860
 There's network tracking.

2:09:14.860 --> 2:09:16.900
 Network privacy is not guaranteed at all

2:09:16.900 --> 2:09:18.980
 because you're using the same internet and ISP

2:09:18.980 --> 2:09:21.340
 as a public window, a non private window.

2:09:21.340 --> 2:09:22.900
 But, Safari had that early on.

2:09:22.900 --> 2:09:26.060
 They also had a cookie blocking policy

2:09:26.060 --> 2:09:27.860
 that might take a little explaining.

2:09:27.860 --> 2:09:29.820
 When you, if you know what a cookie is,

2:09:29.820 --> 2:09:31.300
 it's a little bit of storage in the browser

2:09:31.300 --> 2:09:33.420
 indexed by the name of the site.

2:09:33.420 --> 2:09:35.060
 And it's really only the main name of the site,

2:09:35.060 --> 2:09:40.060
 like bofa.com or, you know, something like npr.org.

2:09:43.700 --> 2:09:45.980
 Every site can store some information in a cookie.

2:09:45.980 --> 2:09:48.620
 Every time it's contacted by the browser,

2:09:48.620 --> 2:09:50.860
 the previous version is sent back.

2:09:50.860 --> 2:09:54.060
 And in the response from the server, the cookie's updated.

2:09:54.060 --> 2:09:56.580
 So it's this little bit of storage in the browser

2:09:56.580 --> 2:09:58.180
 that the site can keep updating

2:09:58.180 --> 2:10:01.460
 and it can store an encrypted version

2:10:01.460 --> 2:10:03.820
 of your login credentials with a timestamp

2:10:03.820 --> 2:10:05.980
 so you can stay logged in

2:10:05.980 --> 2:10:07.700
 without having to retype your password

2:10:07.700 --> 2:10:08.820
 every time you navigate,

2:10:08.820 --> 2:10:11.220
 which is how it would be if you didn't have cookies.

2:10:11.220 --> 2:10:14.420
 The web protocols, especially in the 90s,

2:10:14.420 --> 2:10:16.020
 are so called stateless protocols.

2:10:16.020 --> 2:10:18.740
 So you go to your bank, you log in,

2:10:18.740 --> 2:10:21.220
 you go from your login confirmed page

2:10:21.220 --> 2:10:22.460
 to your account view.

2:10:22.460 --> 2:10:24.980
 If you didn't have a cookie, you'd be logging in again.

2:10:24.980 --> 2:10:26.580
 Every time you type in the source.

2:10:26.580 --> 2:10:27.900
 So that was the great thing about cookies.

2:10:27.900 --> 2:10:29.820
 Luhmann truly did it in a hurry in 1994

2:10:29.820 --> 2:10:30.860
 before I joined Escape

2:10:30.860 --> 2:10:34.860
 and he did it for really holding that kind of credential.

2:10:34.860 --> 2:10:37.500
 But even then there was the image element

2:10:37.500 --> 2:10:38.580
 embedded in the page

2:10:38.580 --> 2:10:41.980
 and the image gets fetched possibly from a different server

2:10:41.980 --> 2:10:44.220
 and that request carries the last cookie,

2:10:44.220 --> 2:10:45.740
 which could be empty at first,

2:10:45.740 --> 2:10:47.980
 and the response carries the updated cookie.

2:10:47.980 --> 2:10:49.780
 So just by having images and cookies,

2:10:49.780 --> 2:10:51.420
 you got tracking because that image server

2:10:51.420 --> 2:10:54.220
 can be serving a little one by one pixel

2:10:54.220 --> 2:10:56.500
 and they still use the word pixel in ad tech.

2:10:56.500 --> 2:10:59.380
 And that pixel can be served from the same server,

2:10:59.380 --> 2:11:02.140
 embedded differently with different URL spellings

2:11:02.140 --> 2:11:03.740
 in the New York Times and ESPN.

2:11:03.740 --> 2:11:05.860
 And as you go from one to the other,

2:11:05.860 --> 2:11:06.980
 the image server can say,

2:11:06.980 --> 2:11:08.180
 I haven't got a cookie for you.

2:11:08.180 --> 2:11:09.020
 It's empty initially.

2:11:09.020 --> 2:11:11.260
 I'm gonna assign you user number 1234.

2:11:11.260 --> 2:11:13.020
 I'm gonna put a database entry in.

2:11:13.020 --> 2:11:13.860
 And I see, by the way,

2:11:13.860 --> 2:11:15.980
 I always fetch the name of the path part of the URL

2:11:15.980 --> 2:11:17.460
 that I was in the New York Times.

2:11:17.460 --> 2:11:18.980
 So you're a New York Times reader.

2:11:18.980 --> 2:11:20.980
 And then you hit ESPN, same thing.

2:11:20.980 --> 2:11:22.260
 And the database gets updated

2:11:22.260 --> 2:11:25.580
 and the number user 1234 indexes in the database

2:11:25.580 --> 2:11:28.140
 to a profile of you, you've been tracked.

2:11:28.140 --> 2:11:29.420
 This was not intended.

2:11:29.420 --> 2:11:32.740
 And it was too late to undo by the time I got the Netscape.

2:11:32.740 --> 2:11:35.100
 I think Lou wanted to do Twinkies, he called them.

2:11:35.100 --> 2:11:37.380
 And he was trying to solve several problems.

2:11:37.380 --> 2:11:38.380
 He wanted them to be bigger

2:11:38.380 --> 2:11:40.540
 because initially cookies had a short size limit.

2:11:40.540 --> 2:11:42.340
 I think he wanted to solve the third party problem,

2:11:42.340 --> 2:11:45.100
 but Tom Paquin, the engineering manager said,

2:11:45.100 --> 2:11:47.180
 nope, no Twinkies, just cookies.

2:11:47.180 --> 2:11:48.100
 We're done.

2:11:48.100 --> 2:11:49.060
 You're done, son.

2:11:49.060 --> 2:11:51.540
 And that's how a lot of that stuff was.

2:11:51.540 --> 2:11:54.620
 That's how JavaScript got frozen

2:11:54.620 --> 2:11:55.860
 like a flying Amber in some ways

2:11:55.860 --> 2:11:57.900
 with that sloppy equality operator that I made

2:11:57.900 --> 2:11:58.980
 because of the early adopters.

2:11:58.980 --> 2:12:01.900
 And the cookie got stuck with this tracking hazard.

2:12:01.900 --> 2:12:04.300
 And then because JavaScripts can be like images,

2:12:04.300 --> 2:12:05.940
 they're embedded in the page.

2:12:05.940 --> 2:12:08.660
 By the time Netscape 3, I made that work.

2:12:08.660 --> 2:12:10.820
 You can get a request with the last cookie value

2:12:10.820 --> 2:12:11.940
 and the response updates it.

2:12:11.940 --> 2:12:12.940
 That's a tracking mechanism.

2:12:12.940 --> 2:12:14.940
 And that's why you don't even need images to track.

2:12:14.940 --> 2:12:16.460
 Now you just use scripts.

2:12:16.460 --> 2:12:20.020
 So this whole tracking economy evolved

2:12:20.020 --> 2:12:23.860
 and it depended on these accidents of the 90s,

2:12:23.860 --> 2:12:25.300
 these unintended consequences.

2:12:25.300 --> 2:12:27.200
 Well, it created some of the richest companies

2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:28.040
 in the world, right?

2:12:28.040 --> 2:12:28.860
 I mean, it's the social media.

2:12:28.860 --> 2:12:29.980
 All I got was T shirts.

2:12:29.980 --> 2:12:33.180
 All I got is this crappy T shirt.

2:12:33.180 --> 2:12:34.100
 Yeah.

2:12:34.100 --> 2:12:38.420
 I mean, so that's the fundamental problem

2:12:38.420 --> 2:12:39.500
 the world is facing now.

2:12:39.500 --> 2:12:42.020
 They're looking at what social media has created

2:12:42.020 --> 2:12:44.180
 and they're looking at,

2:12:44.180 --> 2:12:47.020
 and like a world is looking at itself in the mirror

2:12:47.020 --> 2:12:50.980
 and seeing that privacy is actually something

2:12:50.980 --> 2:12:53.540
 as opposed to like a nice thing to have.

2:12:53.540 --> 2:12:57.260
 It's something that is actually should be fundamental

2:12:57.260 --> 2:12:59.220
 to the way we interact with the world

2:12:59.220 --> 2:13:00.600
 as part of our tooling.

2:13:00.600 --> 2:13:03.540
 And that's where the Brave browser comes in.

2:13:03.540 --> 2:13:06.060
 And I suppose others as well are playing with this idea,

2:13:06.060 --> 2:13:07.660
 but Brave is at the forefront of that.

2:13:07.660 --> 2:13:11.020
 So maybe can you like describe what Brave is

2:13:11.020 --> 2:13:14.700
 and what are its key principles and what's broken

2:13:14.700 --> 2:13:16.140
 and what is it Brave trying to fix?

2:13:16.140 --> 2:13:18.380
 So when I realized that these accidents

2:13:18.380 --> 2:13:19.900
 like the third party cookie,

2:13:19.900 --> 2:13:21.840
 the image or script that's tracking you

2:13:21.840 --> 2:13:26.020
 or the JavaScripts that can do an invisibly now,

2:13:26.020 --> 2:13:28.700
 that all this stuff wasn't intended

2:13:28.700 --> 2:13:31.660
 and that Firefox had supported extensions

2:13:31.660 --> 2:13:32.640
 that block some of these things,

2:13:32.640 --> 2:13:34.740
 I thought probably we should have browsers

2:13:34.740 --> 2:13:37.440
 just block some of these things by default.

2:13:37.440 --> 2:13:39.780
 These were not intended and they're now unsafe.

2:13:39.780 --> 2:13:40.620
 They're tracking you.

2:13:40.620 --> 2:13:43.460
 There could be data breaches, malware distribution,

2:13:44.940 --> 2:13:48.420
 bullying and psyops and other attacks on people.

2:13:49.660 --> 2:13:51.500
 Block that stuff, block that JavaScript.

2:13:51.500 --> 2:13:54.700
 I'm Dr. Frankenstein, I've got to deal with a monster here.

2:13:54.700 --> 2:13:56.540
 But obviously you go to Gmail,

2:13:56.540 --> 2:13:57.540
 there's a bunch of script there

2:13:57.540 --> 2:13:59.320
 to make that amazing web client.

2:13:59.320 --> 2:14:02.180
 That's okay, that's first party JavaScript.

2:14:02.180 --> 2:14:04.020
 So how do you tell the first from the third party?

2:14:04.020 --> 2:14:04.860
 And it's not easy.

2:14:04.860 --> 2:14:06.700
 It's not a matter of just what's embedded

2:14:06.700 --> 2:14:09.860
 from a different server because a lot of publishers

2:14:09.860 --> 2:14:12.980
 use benign scripts from unrelated domains

2:14:12.980 --> 2:14:14.360
 or apparently unrelated domains.

2:14:14.360 --> 2:14:16.660
 So you end up having to develop a sort of human

2:14:16.660 --> 2:14:19.700
 and machine learning practice around blocking.

2:14:19.700 --> 2:14:22.300
 And at Brave, we did that from the start

2:14:22.300 --> 2:14:25.740
 and built a research team to help drive it and automate it.

2:14:25.740 --> 2:14:28.900
 We realized that protecting people needed machine learning

2:14:28.900 --> 2:14:30.420
 and around 2017 spring,

2:14:30.420 --> 2:14:32.680
 I talked to my friends at Apple about this too

2:14:32.680 --> 2:14:34.060
 and they were also doing

2:14:34.060 --> 2:14:36.640
 what they call intelligent tracking prevention,

2:14:36.640 --> 2:14:39.320
 which uses local machine learning in the browser.

2:14:39.320 --> 2:14:42.880
 And the funny thing is, great minds think alike,

2:14:42.880 --> 2:14:44.780
 they were taking their third party cookie blocker

2:14:44.780 --> 2:14:46.460
 that was in Safari from the old days

2:14:46.460 --> 2:14:48.540
 and making it not have a big loophole.

2:14:48.540 --> 2:14:51.740
 Because what they did was in 2003, when Safari came out,

2:14:51.740 --> 2:14:53.740
 they said, we're gonna block cookies

2:14:53.740 --> 2:14:57.220
 that are from those third party embedded elements

2:14:57.220 --> 2:14:59.120
 where you've never visited that site before.

2:14:59.120 --> 2:15:02.340
 So I'm gonna pick an ad company that got sold to AT&T,

2:15:02.340 --> 2:15:05.140
 so I'm not picking on anybody unfairly, appnexus.com.

2:15:05.140 --> 2:15:06.660
 Have you ever been to appnexus.com?

2:15:06.660 --> 2:15:07.500
 Nope.

2:15:07.500 --> 2:15:09.020
 I've never been there, but I guarantee you 10 years ago,

2:15:09.020 --> 2:15:11.180
 you probably had, if you were using Firefox,

2:15:11.180 --> 2:15:13.020
 you had a cookie, third party cookie,

2:15:13.020 --> 2:15:14.980
 because you were being tracked by them

2:15:14.980 --> 2:15:15.920
 and they were using that cookie

2:15:15.920 --> 2:15:17.560
 to build up a profile of you.

2:15:17.560 --> 2:15:20.700
 In Safari, as long as the user never went to appnexus,

2:15:20.700 --> 2:15:22.380
 that cookie would not be set.

2:15:22.380 --> 2:15:25.460
 And that was a real move for privacy early on

2:15:25.460 --> 2:15:27.660
 when jobs were still around in Safari.

2:15:27.660 --> 2:15:30.620
 But it had this loophole that if you do go to appnexus,

2:15:30.620 --> 2:15:32.540
 then why it's okay to be a third party cookie.

2:15:32.540 --> 2:15:35.180
 And so appnexus did something very naughty.

2:15:35.180 --> 2:15:36.820
 They took their ad partners

2:15:36.820 --> 2:15:39.000
 to put the actual ad you click on.

2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:40.300
 And they said, hey, add a little script

2:15:40.300 --> 2:15:42.620
 so that when somebody clicks on the ad,

2:15:42.620 --> 2:15:44.500
 before it goes to your landing page,

2:15:44.500 --> 2:15:46.340
 redirect to appnexus and we'll redirect

2:15:46.340 --> 2:15:47.180
 to the landing page.

2:15:47.180 --> 2:15:49.140
 And by doing that, they set a first party cookie

2:15:49.140 --> 2:15:49.980
 and they got whitelisted.

2:15:49.980 --> 2:15:51.660
 So it was a loophole they exploited.

2:15:51.660 --> 2:15:53.580
 Intelligent tracking prevention in Safari

2:15:53.580 --> 2:15:56.620
 was sophisticated enough to counteract this

2:15:56.620 --> 2:15:59.100
 and it did other things and it's evolved since they did it.

2:15:59.100 --> 2:16:00.720
 And we've evolved brave too.

2:16:00.720 --> 2:16:02.560
 And so when I say machine and human learning,

2:16:02.560 --> 2:16:05.580
 there's a real set of techniques here.

2:16:05.580 --> 2:16:06.420
 They have to fight.

2:16:06.420 --> 2:16:07.580
 This is a fascinating problem.

2:16:07.580 --> 2:16:08.400
 Fingerprinting, right?

2:16:08.400 --> 2:16:10.720
 Anytime you have a little bit of storage in the browser

2:16:10.720 --> 2:16:13.580
 associated with a website,

2:16:13.580 --> 2:16:15.540
 if the bad guy can get 32 websites,

2:16:15.540 --> 2:16:17.660
 each one has a bit of storage, that's 32 bits.

2:16:17.660 --> 2:16:19.820
 You can turn the bit on or off,

2:16:19.820 --> 2:16:21.280
 you can make 4 billion numbers,

2:16:21.280 --> 2:16:22.260
 you can make an identifier.

2:16:22.260 --> 2:16:24.660
 It's called a super cookie sometimes.

2:16:26.660 --> 2:16:28.880
 There are weaker ways that are statistical.

2:16:28.880 --> 2:16:29.780
 They're called fingerprinting.

2:16:29.780 --> 2:16:30.780
 You have to block all of them

2:16:30.780 --> 2:16:32.840
 and you have to not only automate,

2:16:32.840 --> 2:16:34.940
 you want to work in the web standards body

2:16:34.940 --> 2:16:38.480
 to put privacy in by default, by design,

2:16:38.480 --> 2:16:40.500
 from the get go, not add it as an afterthought

2:16:40.500 --> 2:16:43.180
 or go hogwile with new web APIs

2:16:43.180 --> 2:16:47.500
 to add a bunch more local storage or fingerprint surface area.

2:16:47.500 --> 2:16:48.660
 And that's been a struggle too,

2:16:48.660 --> 2:16:50.940
 because guess who's the new Microsoft

2:16:50.940 --> 2:16:51.780
 in the standards body?

2:16:51.780 --> 2:16:52.700
 It's Google.

2:16:52.700 --> 2:16:55.900
 And they're not in favor of privacy first.

2:16:55.900 --> 2:16:58.740
 They want to do privacy their way,

2:16:58.740 --> 2:17:01.180
 only under, I would say, market pressure.

2:17:01.180 --> 2:17:03.660
 But with Apple and with Brave leading the way,

2:17:03.660 --> 2:17:06.280
 we block third party cookies almost without exception.

2:17:06.280 --> 2:17:07.940
 So we've just blocked them.

2:17:07.940 --> 2:17:11.540
 And that gives us a very strong privacy benefit,

2:17:11.540 --> 2:17:13.740
 but it also means some sites just don't work right.

2:17:13.740 --> 2:17:15.500
 Embedded YouTube videos might not work right.

2:17:15.500 --> 2:17:19.620
 So we're adapting in a similar way to Apple's done with ITP

2:17:19.620 --> 2:17:22.740
 to make third party cookies blocked,

2:17:22.740 --> 2:17:26.460
 but to sort of simulate what looks like

2:17:26.460 --> 2:17:28.860
 a working third party cookie for the site.

2:17:28.860 --> 2:17:32.320
 It essentially tries to partition each site

2:17:32.320 --> 2:17:34.860
 and its third parties into its own sort of cookie jar.

2:17:34.860 --> 2:17:35.700
 Got it.

2:17:35.700 --> 2:17:37.060
 And so, like you said,

2:17:37.060 --> 2:17:41.100
 is this both like a human fine tuning issue

2:17:41.100 --> 2:17:42.580
 and a machine learning problem?

2:17:42.580 --> 2:17:44.540
 And as the humans learn,

2:17:44.540 --> 2:17:46.380
 then they train the machine learning.

2:17:46.380 --> 2:17:50.580
 But, you know, maybe Google aside or including Google,

2:17:50.580 --> 2:17:53.220
 there's millions of dollars, if not B,

2:17:53.220 --> 2:17:54.900
 billions of dollars to be made

2:17:54.900 --> 2:17:57.860
 from fighting the ways of Brave.

2:17:57.860 --> 2:17:58.700
 That's right.

2:17:58.700 --> 2:18:00.660
 And it's been an interesting change

2:18:00.660 --> 2:18:01.980
 from when we started in 2015.

2:18:01.980 --> 2:18:04.420
 When we started, you know, ad blocking extensions,

2:18:04.420 --> 2:18:06.140
 ad block plus was one of the big ones

2:18:06.140 --> 2:18:08.660
 that started on Firefox in 2006, I believe,

2:18:08.660 --> 2:18:11.020
 had gotten to a certain level of use around the world.

2:18:11.020 --> 2:18:14.380
 And browsers like UC Web, UC Browser in Asia

2:18:14.380 --> 2:18:17.300
 had some amount of ad blocking built in and on by default.

2:18:17.300 --> 2:18:19.300
 So, a page fair was a startup

2:18:20.500 --> 2:18:23.580
 and they measured ad blocking adoption.

2:18:23.580 --> 2:18:24.420
 And they tried to say,

2:18:24.420 --> 2:18:26.580
 hey publishers, you're, you know,

2:18:26.580 --> 2:18:30.200
 30% of the visitors to Pitchfork or Wire

2:18:30.200 --> 2:18:32.900
 to Conda NAS properties are using ad blockers.

2:18:32.900 --> 2:18:34.380
 If we can somehow convince them

2:18:34.380 --> 2:18:37.340
 to lower their ad blocking for your site,

2:18:37.340 --> 2:18:39.300
 that could be like a 43% lift, right?

2:18:39.300 --> 2:18:42.020
 And, you know, three sevenths.

2:18:42.020 --> 2:18:44.260
 Well, that's easier said than done.

2:18:44.260 --> 2:18:46.140
 And PageFair and others, SourcePoint,

2:18:46.140 --> 2:18:48.060
 and many others tried to either smuggle ads through

2:18:48.060 --> 2:18:52.260
 or cajole the user into letting, you know, ads appear.

2:18:52.260 --> 2:18:53.100
 And it didn't really work.

2:18:53.100 --> 2:18:54.460
 And meanwhile, the ad blocking adoption

2:18:54.460 --> 2:18:56.860
 has just continued intelligent tracking prevention

2:18:56.860 --> 2:19:01.620
 in Safari in 2017, Brave from 2016 on

2:19:01.620 --> 2:19:04.460
 with very strong cookie blocking and other protections.

2:19:04.460 --> 2:19:06.660
 And this is not going away.

2:19:06.660 --> 2:19:08.500
 The publishers used to rage against it.

2:19:08.500 --> 2:19:10.460
 Like we would try to say, we can help you.

2:19:10.460 --> 2:19:11.960
 You're dealing with users

2:19:11.960 --> 2:19:14.100
 who are already blocking all your ads.

2:19:14.100 --> 2:19:16.800
 We can try to put back some economics

2:19:16.800 --> 2:19:18.460
 that help the user and you

2:19:18.460 --> 2:19:19.980
 that led to the basic attention token

2:19:19.980 --> 2:19:21.460
 that we started with Bitcoin.

2:19:21.460 --> 2:19:22.460
 We can be your friend.

2:19:22.460 --> 2:19:24.980
 Don't just fingerprint us as an ad blocker

2:19:24.980 --> 2:19:26.480
 and treat us as an enemy.

2:19:26.480 --> 2:19:28.620
 But in 2015 or 16, it was like,

2:19:28.620 --> 2:19:29.540
 nah, you're an ad blocker.

2:19:29.540 --> 2:19:30.380
 Get out of here.

2:19:30.380 --> 2:19:31.200
 I hate you.

2:19:31.200 --> 2:19:33.740
 And by 2017 or 18, it's like something's happening.

2:19:33.740 --> 2:19:34.940
 The ad blocking is not stopping

2:19:34.940 --> 2:19:37.020
 and we're all getting sort of pulled

2:19:37.020 --> 2:19:41.580
 on the Google's plantation through AMP, AMP.

2:19:41.580 --> 2:19:44.580
 Or we're getting killed by the Google ad system we use

2:19:44.580 --> 2:19:46.620
 because it's taking all the revenue

2:19:46.620 --> 2:19:49.140
 or it's permitting or some other vendors we use

2:19:49.140 --> 2:19:50.140
 are permitting ad fraud.

2:19:50.140 --> 2:19:52.640
 And so a fake New York Times is getting paid

2:19:52.640 --> 2:19:57.140
 by the marketer running an ad that a bot clicks on.

2:19:57.140 --> 2:19:58.240
 And the real New York Times

2:19:58.240 --> 2:20:00.500
 that's supposed to get the ad doesn't get it.

2:20:00.500 --> 2:20:01.540
 And there's something really broken

2:20:01.540 --> 2:20:02.460
 about that kind of system.

2:20:02.460 --> 2:20:06.700
 And that fraud is mediated through Google's ad exchange,

2:20:06.700 --> 2:20:07.860
 which is the biggest of them all.

2:20:07.860 --> 2:20:09.660
 And Google takes a fee.

2:20:09.660 --> 2:20:10.700
 There's a flip side of that,

2:20:10.700 --> 2:20:12.660
 which is malware distribution, malvertising,

2:20:12.660 --> 2:20:16.300
 where fake advertisers put malware payloads

2:20:16.300 --> 2:20:19.340
 in or exploit hit loaders in JavaScript

2:20:19.340 --> 2:20:22.460
 and they smuggle them in ads onto real publisher pages,

2:20:22.460 --> 2:20:24.460
 the ad exchange takes the fee.

2:20:24.460 --> 2:20:25.580
 Now, I'm not a lawyer.

2:20:25.580 --> 2:20:27.100
 I'm not gonna say this is a RICO predicate,

2:20:27.100 --> 2:20:30.220
 but why is the ad exchange facilitating fraud

2:20:30.220 --> 2:20:32.060
 and malware distribution and taking a fee?

2:20:32.060 --> 2:20:32.880
 It's not right.

2:20:32.880 --> 2:20:33.940
 As opposed to just fighting,

2:20:33.940 --> 2:20:35.660
 this is the really interesting thing about Brave

2:20:35.660 --> 2:20:37.700
 is as opposed to just fighting

2:20:37.700 --> 2:20:39.980
 and then being treated like an ad blocker,

2:20:39.980 --> 2:20:42.060
 you're providing an alternate.

2:20:42.060 --> 2:20:45.460
 There's a philosophical idea here

2:20:45.460 --> 2:20:47.500
 that might change the nature of the internet

2:20:47.500 --> 2:20:49.220
 with the basic attention token.

2:20:49.220 --> 2:20:50.060
 Yes.

2:20:50.060 --> 2:20:54.060
 Well, maybe what is basic attention token BAT

2:20:54.060 --> 2:20:55.300
 and how does it work?

2:20:55.300 --> 2:20:58.200
 Okay, I'll tell the story first by saying how I came to it.

2:20:58.200 --> 2:21:00.820
 I realized for a long time at Firefox,

2:21:00.820 --> 2:21:02.940
 we were dependent on this Google search deal.

2:21:02.940 --> 2:21:05.700
 And I thought, now that Chrome's out,

2:21:05.700 --> 2:21:07.260
 maybe that's gonna go away.

2:21:07.260 --> 2:21:10.740
 And they just, at some point, Google will say,

2:21:10.740 --> 2:21:14.620
 Firefox, like old yeller, you saved me from the rabid beast,

2:21:14.620 --> 2:21:16.360
 now I have to shoot you in the head.

2:21:16.360 --> 2:21:19.660
 Done your job, sad but true, goodbye.

2:21:19.660 --> 2:21:21.780
 And what could we do?

2:21:21.780 --> 2:21:24.140
 And I think Mozilla doesn't know what to do.

2:21:24.140 --> 2:21:25.900
 This is something that I couldn't solve there

2:21:25.900 --> 2:21:27.220
 and I don't think they can solve.

2:21:27.220 --> 2:21:29.460
 But I thought, why is the browser

2:21:29.460 --> 2:21:32.300
 the sort of passive servant of these big tech companies?

2:21:32.300 --> 2:21:36.420
 Why is it a blind runtime for ad tech JavaScripts,

2:21:36.420 --> 2:21:38.100
 including from Google?

2:21:38.100 --> 2:21:39.220
 Why doesn't it block some?

2:21:39.220 --> 2:21:43.940
 And if it blocks some, why can't it reconnect users,

2:21:43.940 --> 2:21:47.520
 readers, fans with publishers, creators, websites?

2:21:48.480 --> 2:21:51.220
 Why can't it help people make direct payments

2:21:51.220 --> 2:21:54.900
 or even possibly get an ad revenue share for private ads

2:21:54.900 --> 2:21:56.300
 that are placed in the browser?

2:21:56.300 --> 2:21:57.580
 The ads are all placed in the browser.

2:21:57.580 --> 2:21:58.840
 Some people have this sort of model

2:21:58.840 --> 2:22:01.620
 that the server's painting the ad into some,

2:22:01.620 --> 2:22:06.500
 flash combined package or into some giant image

2:22:06.500 --> 2:22:08.600
 and then it all gets sent down, that's not how it works.

2:22:08.600 --> 2:22:11.340
 All the ads you see on the web are placed in your browser

2:22:11.340 --> 2:22:13.980
 by it calling out to various ad tech partners

2:22:13.980 --> 2:22:15.620
 and Google's among them.

2:22:15.620 --> 2:22:17.580
 And so if you block those scripts,

2:22:17.580 --> 2:22:22.420
 you break the advertising flow of money

2:22:22.420 --> 2:22:26.300
 from the brands and their agencies to the publishers.

2:22:26.300 --> 2:22:29.460
 And if you want to reconnect it directly with the user,

2:22:29.460 --> 2:22:30.420
 you have limited choices.

2:22:30.420 --> 2:22:31.940
 The user generally isn't gonna sign up

2:22:31.940 --> 2:22:34.980
 with a ACH bank connection or a credit card.

2:22:34.980 --> 2:22:37.260
 The publisher isn't gonna sign up the user

2:22:37.260 --> 2:22:39.980
 except as a subscriber and then they're gonna overcharge you

2:22:39.980 --> 2:22:42.060
 because they want you to cross subsidize all the content

2:22:42.060 --> 2:22:43.660
 and buy more than you read and all that stuff.

2:22:43.660 --> 2:22:47.220
 And how many, people are doing great who are big names

2:22:47.220 --> 2:22:48.740
 like New York Times and The Washington Post,

2:22:48.740 --> 2:22:51.820
 but how many subscriptions are you as a user gonna pay for?

2:22:51.820 --> 2:22:54.420
 This is why startups like Tony Hale Scroll

2:22:54.420 --> 2:22:57.160
 are trying to do a portable subscription system.

2:22:57.160 --> 2:22:58.860
 By the way, just a small tangent there,

2:22:58.860 --> 2:23:00.860
 even the New York Times is really annoying

2:23:00.860 --> 2:23:03.300
 how difficult it is to subscribe.

2:23:03.300 --> 2:23:04.620
 There's way too many clicks.

2:23:04.620 --> 2:23:05.460
 They don't make it easy.

2:23:05.460 --> 2:23:06.300
 And I had friends a few years ago,

2:23:06.300 --> 2:23:08.340
 I think they fixed this, who would pay for the paper

2:23:08.340 --> 2:23:11.140
 and then they'd go online and they get upcharged

2:23:11.140 --> 2:23:13.140
 for the digital and there was no break.

2:23:13.140 --> 2:23:15.380
 There was no connection between them.

2:23:15.380 --> 2:23:17.260
 But publishers are not that technical

2:23:17.260 --> 2:23:19.580
 and they can't all get you to subscribe.

2:23:19.580 --> 2:23:21.300
 You can't have a thousand subscriptions.

2:23:21.300 --> 2:23:23.460
 So for a long time, people talked about micropayments.

2:23:23.460 --> 2:23:25.860
 There was Blendle and other ones which came to the US,

2:23:25.860 --> 2:23:27.580
 but it didn't grow.

2:23:27.580 --> 2:23:29.820
 And I thought, if you have just a browser

2:23:29.820 --> 2:23:31.200
 and it's protecting you by blocking

2:23:31.200 --> 2:23:32.900
 all this ad tech tracking junk,

2:23:33.820 --> 2:23:36.620
 it can provide you an option that uses cryptocurrency

2:23:36.620 --> 2:23:39.420
 to let you support your favorite sites

2:23:39.420 --> 2:23:40.580
 and even YouTube channels.

2:23:40.580 --> 2:23:42.740
 And that we prototyped with Bitcoin.

2:23:42.740 --> 2:23:45.940
 And that meant the user had to be of means to contribute

2:23:45.940 --> 2:23:47.480
 and willing to contribute,

2:23:47.480 --> 2:23:49.220
 but it could be done on the Bitcoin blockchain

2:23:49.220 --> 2:23:50.560
 and it could be fairly efficient

2:23:50.560 --> 2:23:52.260
 even though Bitcoin went through a period

2:23:52.260 --> 2:23:55.740
 when we had this prototype running in 2016 into 2017

2:23:55.740 --> 2:23:58.780
 where Bitcoin was very congested and very slow to confirm

2:23:58.780 --> 2:24:00.140
 and the fees got very high.

2:24:01.020 --> 2:24:03.540
 And a lot of users who were not Bitcoin maximalists

2:24:03.540 --> 2:24:04.940
 or even experienced,

2:24:04.940 --> 2:24:07.620
 we helped them out by embedding a Coinbase buy widget

2:24:07.620 --> 2:24:10.180
 and they had the income to buy, but it was hard.

2:24:10.180 --> 2:24:12.420
 It was like, do I buy $5 a month?

2:24:12.420 --> 2:24:14.320
 But the fee is like 450.

2:24:14.320 --> 2:24:16.420
 I better buy in larger batches, right?

2:24:16.420 --> 2:24:18.540
 And they're like, I don't wanna own that much Bitcoin.

2:24:18.540 --> 2:24:21.180
 So it became this painful thing.

2:24:21.180 --> 2:24:23.800
 And the real idea that I had of private ads

2:24:23.800 --> 2:24:25.940
 that pay the user a rev share

2:24:25.940 --> 2:24:30.580
 couldn't be realized alone in that kind of system.

2:24:30.580 --> 2:24:33.060
 In these cryptocurrency systems,

2:24:33.060 --> 2:24:35.180
 especially with the blockchain we switched to Ethereum,

2:24:35.180 --> 2:24:36.920
 you can have smart contracts.

2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:38.980
 The Bitcoin system is not turned complete.

2:24:38.980 --> 2:24:41.100
 So what you can do with the scripts is more limited,

2:24:41.100 --> 2:24:44.500
 but you can still do sort of clever things

2:24:44.500 --> 2:24:46.140
 even with Bitcoin script.

2:24:46.140 --> 2:24:49.280
 What we wanted to do was sort of a three sided ecosystem.

2:24:49.280 --> 2:24:53.740
 We wanted users, creators or publishers and advertisers.

2:24:53.740 --> 2:24:55.740
 And we wanted the advertisers to put money in

2:24:55.740 --> 2:24:57.140
 just like they do today,

2:24:57.140 --> 2:25:00.380
 but without going through the Googles and the app nexuses

2:25:00.380 --> 2:25:01.980
 and all these other ad tech companies,

2:25:01.980 --> 2:25:04.420
 because those companies take out a huge cut.

2:25:04.420 --> 2:25:06.940
 The Guardian in the UK once did an experiment for a month.

2:25:06.940 --> 2:25:08.820
 They bought out their own ad space.

2:25:08.820 --> 2:25:11.180
 They put in a pound and they were paid 30 pence.

2:25:11.180 --> 2:25:15.200
 70% was coming out to the intermediary vendors

2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:16.120
 they were using.

2:25:17.020 --> 2:25:19.260
 And that's like the opposite of what the app store does.

2:25:19.260 --> 2:25:22.220
 The app store takes 30% and gives the publisher 70%.

2:25:22.220 --> 2:25:26.180
 So pretty broken, in the old days of the superstation TBS,

2:25:26.180 --> 2:25:29.900
 the media owner would get 85%.

2:25:29.900 --> 2:25:33.460
 So these splits have become really unbalanced

2:25:33.460 --> 2:25:35.720
 and the middle players, the ad tech vendors

2:25:35.720 --> 2:25:37.420
 are taking out way too much money.

2:25:37.420 --> 2:25:39.700
 And they're doing something worse, which has been noticed.

2:25:39.700 --> 2:25:44.060
 They're letting not just the malware vendors,

2:25:44.060 --> 2:25:47.220
 but also the ad fraud side, which fakes the publishers

2:25:47.220 --> 2:25:52.120
 and clickbait merchants come in and steal traffic

2:25:52.120 --> 2:25:53.220
 from good sites.

2:25:53.220 --> 2:25:55.640
 Because once you have a certain audience identified

2:25:55.640 --> 2:25:57.500
 at one site, Jason Calconas told me this

2:25:57.500 --> 2:25:59.900
 about his experience with, I guess it was in Gadget,

2:25:59.900 --> 2:26:01.620
 I forget which site he was running.

2:26:01.620 --> 2:26:04.180
 But once he started using an ad partner

2:26:04.180 --> 2:26:06.200
 that was sharing his audience information

2:26:06.200 --> 2:26:08.420
 across multiple sites, he saw his competitors

2:26:08.420 --> 2:26:09.540
 stealing all his traffic.

2:26:09.540 --> 2:26:11.540
 And then what's worse is the clickbait sites

2:26:11.540 --> 2:26:15.500
 that just have much cheaper rates steal all that traffic.

2:26:15.500 --> 2:26:20.300
 And that facilitates fraud, facilitates fake news,

2:26:20.300 --> 2:26:21.340
 all sorts of problems.

2:26:21.340 --> 2:26:24.580
 So Gray blocks it and then we give users the ability

2:26:24.580 --> 2:26:27.460
 to give back and because we invented

2:26:27.460 --> 2:26:28.940
 the basic attention token on Ethereum,

2:26:28.940 --> 2:26:31.020
 we can do this three way split.

2:26:31.020 --> 2:26:33.620
 And we can give users a share of the revenue.

2:26:33.620 --> 2:26:35.500
 And if they want to take it out, they can.

2:26:35.500 --> 2:26:38.240
 Now, unfortunately for us and for all blockchain,

2:26:38.240 --> 2:26:39.800
 the regulators are saying,

2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:41.300
 we're gonna have to know who you are.

2:26:41.300 --> 2:26:46.300
 There's the Treasury Department's FinCEN agency.

2:26:47.320 --> 2:26:50.780
 There's the Office of Foreign Asset Controls, OFAC.

2:26:50.780 --> 2:26:55.260
 There's the other regulators in the federal government

2:26:55.260 --> 2:26:58.260
 that take a very dark look at things like money laundering

2:26:58.260 --> 2:27:01.260
 and sending money to someone named Osama bin Laden.

2:27:01.260 --> 2:27:03.540
 So compliance starts to come in.

2:27:03.540 --> 2:27:06.100
 And even now they're threatening for pure Bitcoin

2:27:06.100 --> 2:27:07.820
 sending to some address.

2:27:07.820 --> 2:27:10.260
 If you're a Coinbase, you're gonna have to know

2:27:10.260 --> 2:27:11.340
 who's at that address.

2:27:11.340 --> 2:27:12.180
 You're gonna have to start.

2:27:12.180 --> 2:27:13.580
 Like the actual identities of people involved.

2:27:13.580 --> 2:27:14.900
 Yeah, now with Coinbase members,

2:27:14.900 --> 2:27:15.900
 you sign up and they know you

2:27:15.900 --> 2:27:16.980
 and they comply with the regulations.

2:27:16.980 --> 2:27:20.220
 They're a regulated money services business.

2:27:20.220 --> 2:27:25.220
 And, but if somebody's using their own self custody,

2:27:25.600 --> 2:27:27.240
 so called self custodial wallet

2:27:27.240 --> 2:27:29.340
 where they have the hardware private key

2:27:29.340 --> 2:27:32.480
 and they're not named and they want to send to that address,

2:27:33.620 --> 2:27:35.080
 our friends in the federal government are talking about

2:27:35.080 --> 2:27:37.560
 requiring at some threshold and knowing who that is.

2:27:37.560 --> 2:27:38.400
 So.

2:27:38.400 --> 2:27:40.460
 Some threshold that's unreasonable.

2:27:40.460 --> 2:27:42.220
 It's not that big.

2:27:42.220 --> 2:27:43.060
 Yeah.

2:27:43.060 --> 2:27:43.880
 Yeah, I don't know how this will play out.

2:27:43.880 --> 2:27:44.820
 I think crypto is here to stay.

2:27:44.820 --> 2:27:47.260
 I think the beauty of being able to send peer to peer

2:27:47.260 --> 2:27:48.500
 without any bank in the middle,

2:27:48.500 --> 2:27:51.620
 without any huge wire charge and two day delay

2:27:51.620 --> 2:27:52.460
 and all that nonsense.

2:27:52.460 --> 2:27:54.340
 It's beautiful and I've used it and I love it.

2:27:54.340 --> 2:27:56.400
 But we're pragmatists are brave about crypto.

2:27:56.400 --> 2:27:59.580
 And we realized that anything like a revenue split,

2:27:59.580 --> 2:28:02.180
 we can't facilitate without being licensed in a certain way

2:28:02.180 --> 2:28:03.880
 and it requires knowing who the user is.

2:28:03.880 --> 2:28:06.460
 So our default mode doesn't know who the user is.

2:28:06.460 --> 2:28:09.540
 It instead imputes to the user's browser,

2:28:09.540 --> 2:28:11.820
 some of the revenue and allows that browser

2:28:11.820 --> 2:28:14.940
 to steer it back to the creators.

2:28:14.940 --> 2:28:16.680
 And we do have to identify the creators.

2:28:16.680 --> 2:28:20.460
 But as things improve and who knows how it'll play out,

2:28:20.460 --> 2:28:22.820
 there should become a day when this full vision

2:28:22.820 --> 2:28:25.740
 can be done more fully on a blockchain.

2:28:25.740 --> 2:28:29.260
 But regulations and the practicalities of today's blockchains,

2:28:29.260 --> 2:28:32.700
 which are not that fast and not anonymous over time,

2:28:32.700 --> 2:28:34.780
 you fingerprint yourself over time.

2:28:34.780 --> 2:28:36.260
 We do some of this with the browser.

2:28:36.260 --> 2:28:39.780
 So one of the ideas of the basic attention token

2:28:39.780 --> 2:28:41.880
 is to make a hybrid system

2:28:41.880 --> 2:28:43.420
 that's stronger than blockchain alone.

2:28:43.420 --> 2:28:45.900
 It's the browser and the blockchain.

2:28:45.900 --> 2:28:48.420
 And the browser is this trusted endpoint software.

2:28:48.420 --> 2:28:49.980
 It's this universal app.

2:28:49.980 --> 2:28:51.120
 Everyone uses browsers.

2:28:51.120 --> 2:28:53.020
 The bigger the screen, the more you're in the browser

2:28:53.020 --> 2:28:56.140
 and the less you install fat clients for things.

2:28:56.140 --> 2:29:00.140
 I use Slack on Mac OS and it's like a browser.

2:29:00.140 --> 2:29:02.140
 It's based on an electron framework we used to use.

2:29:02.140 --> 2:29:04.740
 And it's just, it's not that great.

2:29:04.740 --> 2:29:07.780
 Some of the people at Brave use Slack in Brave as a...

2:29:07.780 --> 2:29:08.620
 In the browser, yeah.

2:29:08.620 --> 2:29:09.440
 In the browser, yeah.

2:29:09.440 --> 2:29:10.340
 I use that often, yeah.

2:29:10.340 --> 2:29:13.140
 And I noticed on the iPad, I use apps less.

2:29:13.140 --> 2:29:16.460
 The smaller the screen, the browser got handicapped

2:29:16.460 --> 2:29:17.960
 by Apple and Android both.

2:29:17.960 --> 2:29:22.700
 And it also can be slower or not have the right affordances,

2:29:22.700 --> 2:29:26.780
 the interface with the security limited APIs.

2:29:26.780 --> 2:29:28.740
 But in principle, with the right permissioning,

2:29:28.740 --> 2:29:31.680
 you can make the web browser just as good as any app.

2:29:31.680 --> 2:29:33.380
 You make it be a super app.

2:29:33.380 --> 2:29:35.120
 And that's part of our mission at Brave.

2:29:35.120 --> 2:29:37.820
 So we want to have the economics that got captured

2:29:37.820 --> 2:29:40.060
 by these big tech companies through tracking

2:29:40.060 --> 2:29:41.380
 and through social networks.

2:29:41.380 --> 2:29:43.300
 We want to block that for your own safety

2:29:43.300 --> 2:29:45.480
 and then let you opt into a cleaner world

2:29:45.480 --> 2:29:47.980
 where you keep your data defended in your browser

2:29:47.980 --> 2:29:49.840
 and you can actually realize value from it.

2:29:49.840 --> 2:29:51.300
 So the way our ad system works,

2:29:51.300 --> 2:29:53.340
 I mentioned it being private, but how does that work?

2:29:53.340 --> 2:29:54.980
 We don't see your data at all.

2:29:54.980 --> 2:29:57.740
 All browsers are sort of the mother of all data feeds,

2:29:57.740 --> 2:30:00.700
 your history, all your searches at all engines.

2:30:00.700 --> 2:30:02.560
 Each engine sees the queries you send to it,

2:30:02.560 --> 2:30:03.500
 but it doesn't see the others,

2:30:03.500 --> 2:30:05.220
 but the browser sees them all.

2:30:05.220 --> 2:30:07.540
 Machine learning in the browser that you can opt into

2:30:07.540 --> 2:30:10.140
 can study all that in a very complete way

2:30:10.140 --> 2:30:11.980
 and do a better job than Google does.

2:30:11.980 --> 2:30:15.180
 Google has cookie and scripts across the web

2:30:15.180 --> 2:30:17.860
 from acquiring DoubleClick, they have YouTube,

2:30:17.860 --> 2:30:19.700
 they have Android, they have search,

2:30:19.700 --> 2:30:21.580
 which is still their big revenue lane,

2:30:21.580 --> 2:30:22.620
 but they don't see everything.

2:30:22.620 --> 2:30:23.780
 The browser sees everything.

2:30:23.780 --> 2:30:25.180
 And if it can do a good job locally,

2:30:25.180 --> 2:30:26.660
 and this is not advanced machine learning,

2:30:26.660 --> 2:30:29.620
 this is not TensorFlow, this is like SVMs now,

2:30:29.620 --> 2:30:34.620
 naive Bayes, then you can match intense signals,

2:30:35.020 --> 2:30:37.180
 intense signals from those data feeds,

2:30:37.180 --> 2:30:40.220
 searches, the queries, the history, how much you're

2:30:40.220 --> 2:30:43.860
 scrolling down a page, how much you redid a search.

2:30:43.860 --> 2:30:47.020
 It's all blind browser algorithm, we don't see that data.

2:30:47.020 --> 2:30:50.820
 And then pick the best ad from a fixed catalog per day.

2:30:50.820 --> 2:30:53.460
 And the catalog is fixed across a large population per day,

2:30:53.460 --> 2:30:55.100
 and it only updates once a day,

2:30:55.100 --> 2:30:57.620
 because new offers come in and old ones expire,

2:30:57.620 --> 2:30:59.620
 sometimes every week or every month.

2:30:59.620 --> 2:31:02.740
 And that catalog, and there can be many such catalogs,

2:31:02.740 --> 2:31:06.220
 is sold by our direct sales team.

2:31:06.220 --> 2:31:09.420
 And so we're making an anonymous audience available

2:31:09.420 --> 2:31:12.020
 to advertisers without the advertisers tracking them.

2:31:12.020 --> 2:31:15.300
 Instead, each browser is a little machine learning system

2:31:15.300 --> 2:31:17.180
 that's picking the best catalog entry.

2:31:17.180 --> 2:31:19.340
 Now, the catalog is not the ads, those are big, right?

2:31:19.340 --> 2:31:21.420
 It's a video or a webpage, it's just the link

2:31:21.420 --> 2:31:23.820
 to an edge cache, and there are many such edge caches.

2:31:23.820 --> 2:31:25.620
 We're not trying to protect them from seeing

2:31:25.620 --> 2:31:27.780
 your IP address, it's not really feasible.

2:31:27.780 --> 2:31:30.260
 We could use Tor, but we don't yet.

2:31:30.260 --> 2:31:31.980
 And then some keywords about the ad.

2:31:31.980 --> 2:31:34.900
 So it's basically like metadata and a link.

2:31:34.900 --> 2:31:36.340
 And that's what the catalog consists of,

2:31:36.340 --> 2:31:37.460
 and that's what the machine learning picks.

2:31:37.460 --> 2:31:39.020
 And the machine learning is learning

2:31:39.020 --> 2:31:41.820
 about the use specifically locally

2:31:41.820 --> 2:31:44.180
 in order to choose from the catalog of different ads.

2:31:44.180 --> 2:31:47.780
 Couldn't this possibly be like a multi billion dollar,

2:31:47.780 --> 2:31:50.980
 isn't this taken on the Google ad?

2:31:50.980 --> 2:31:51.820
 Could be.

2:31:51.820 --> 2:31:54.580
 So like what, I mean, one question to ask,

2:31:54.580 --> 2:31:57.380
 there seems to be some really profound ideas here

2:31:57.380 --> 2:32:01.900
 that are different than what the internet has grown up to be.

2:32:01.900 --> 2:32:05.340
 If Brave or something like Brave,

2:32:05.340 --> 2:32:07.580
 the ideas, the fundamental philosophical ideas

2:32:07.580 --> 2:32:12.580
 underlying Brave went out and runs 95% of the internet,

2:32:13.100 --> 2:32:18.100
 how does that change the, what are the major things

2:32:18.500 --> 2:32:19.620
 these changes about the internet?

2:32:19.620 --> 2:32:21.620
 So social networks and then the creatives,

2:32:21.620 --> 2:32:23.660
 like YouTube creators and all that kind of stuff.

2:32:23.660 --> 2:32:24.580
 So let's talk about that.

2:32:24.580 --> 2:32:26.260
 First of all, if Brave gets 95%,

2:32:26.260 --> 2:32:29.100
 I'm gonna demand a recount, because I won't believe it.

2:32:29.100 --> 2:32:31.980
 I don't know, I think we're trying to put things

2:32:31.980 --> 2:32:34.980
 into web standards that can be standardized across browsers.

2:32:34.980 --> 2:32:38.940
 So the main value of Brave will be the trust users have in us

2:32:38.940 --> 2:32:41.340
 and our ability to give the best deal to users.

2:32:41.340 --> 2:32:45.140
 So 70% of the gross ad revenue we give to the user.

2:32:45.140 --> 2:32:47.940
 And if they go through that KYC process I mentioned,

2:32:47.940 --> 2:32:48.940
 they can take it out.

2:32:48.940 --> 2:32:50.620
 They can also give it back, they can take some out,

2:32:50.620 --> 2:32:51.460
 give the rest back.

2:32:51.460 --> 2:32:54.660
 They can add basic attention tokens to give back.

2:32:54.660 --> 2:32:56.140
 Some of them turn off the ads,

2:32:56.140 --> 2:32:57.220
 cause they just don't like ads,

2:32:57.220 --> 2:32:58.980
 but they put in $20 a month.

2:32:58.980 --> 2:33:01.140
 But I believe Zuko of Zcashframe does that.

2:33:01.140 --> 2:33:02.060
 And that's very generous,

2:33:02.060 --> 2:33:04.100
 because the browser is just anonymously

2:33:04.100 --> 2:33:06.260
 based on his browsing, sort of keeping score

2:33:06.260 --> 2:33:09.540
 on how much time he spent on this video, on that website.

2:33:09.540 --> 2:33:13.260
 And if those sites verify in sort of a,

2:33:13.260 --> 2:33:15.240
 like getting a domain certificate fashion,

2:33:15.240 --> 2:33:19.260
 they can get paid, they can get part of his $20 a month.

2:33:19.260 --> 2:33:21.140
 So that vision could go big.

2:33:21.140 --> 2:33:23.400
 And if it does, I hope it's across multiple browsers.

2:33:23.400 --> 2:33:25.980
 I don't know that they'll all compete well

2:33:25.980 --> 2:33:29.020
 on the quality of the ads, the quality of the ad blocking

2:33:29.020 --> 2:33:30.340
 and tracking protection.

2:33:30.340 --> 2:33:31.860
 Those are subject to competition.

2:33:31.860 --> 2:33:33.380
 It'll take a while to standardize them.

2:33:33.380 --> 2:33:35.380
 But I think that would be a better world.

2:33:35.380 --> 2:33:38.220
 It would have less counterparty risk,

2:33:38.220 --> 2:33:40.740
 fewer fee takers in the middle, really just the browser.

2:33:40.740 --> 2:33:44.580
 We're taking 30%, sort of the app store split.

2:33:44.580 --> 2:33:47.420
 And if we get bigger, maybe we can take even less.

2:33:47.420 --> 2:33:49.540
 Social networks, creators.

2:33:49.540 --> 2:33:52.220
 If you look at YouTubers, a lot of them are the indies

2:33:52.220 --> 2:33:56.700
 that are getting some size are getting sponsorship deals.

2:33:56.700 --> 2:33:58.840
 They're using Patreon.

2:33:58.840 --> 2:34:01.420
 They're encouraging people to subscribe

2:34:01.420 --> 2:34:04.300
 and give them regular money through Patreon.

2:34:04.300 --> 2:34:06.080
 But that's centralized through Patreon.

2:34:06.080 --> 2:34:09.840
 So there's censorship hazards, there's a 5% fee.

2:34:09.840 --> 2:34:10.960
 What if that were a web standard?

2:34:10.960 --> 2:34:14.500
 What if Brave pioneered it first and we took 3%?

2:34:14.500 --> 2:34:17.460
 And we did it in a way that was through your browser

2:34:17.460 --> 2:34:19.180
 so we couldn't censor it.

2:34:19.180 --> 2:34:20.220
 That's brilliant.

2:34:20.220 --> 2:34:22.780
 Do you think it could be standardized across browsers?

2:34:22.780 --> 2:34:25.580
 Can Internet Explorer come in again and...

2:34:25.580 --> 2:34:27.900
 Yeah, protocols are easy to copy

2:34:27.900 --> 2:34:29.500
 in that they're meant to be interoperable.

2:34:29.500 --> 2:34:31.100
 So there's a risk there.

2:34:31.100 --> 2:34:33.980
 And the loyal users might be tricked into leaving you.

2:34:33.980 --> 2:34:36.180
 Or they might, because of that distribution power,

2:34:36.180 --> 2:34:38.260
 you might end up getting stomped.

2:34:38.260 --> 2:34:39.640
 I don't know, I can't predict the future.

2:34:39.640 --> 2:34:42.300
 I think antitrust is back on the case finally in the US.

2:34:42.300 --> 2:34:45.420
 And certainly in Europe, G Comp is doing its thing.

2:34:45.420 --> 2:34:48.820
 So I'm hopeful that we'll have a period of innovation.

2:34:48.820 --> 2:34:50.620
 People were talking, like Elizabeth Warren was talking

2:34:50.620 --> 2:34:53.700
 about breaking up the tech companies very clearly.

2:34:53.700 --> 2:34:56.460
 Now she didn't win, and I suspect that won't happen,

2:34:56.460 --> 2:34:58.400
 but I also suspect that Google might be smart enough

2:34:58.400 --> 2:35:01.040
 to see they should do something more

2:35:01.040 --> 2:35:03.380
 than just put privacy perfume on Chrome.

2:35:03.380 --> 2:35:05.300
 They should maybe get rid of DoubleClick or something,

2:35:05.300 --> 2:35:06.700
 divest something.

2:35:06.700 --> 2:35:07.780
 I don't know, it might happen.

2:35:07.780 --> 2:35:10.380
 So Brave might inspire Google to completely change

2:35:10.380 --> 2:35:11.420
 the way they're doing things in the browser?

2:35:11.420 --> 2:35:12.780
 They're already doing something,

2:35:12.780 --> 2:35:15.460
 you may have read about called the Privacy Sandbox

2:35:15.460 --> 2:35:20.020
 or Flock, which they have this bird metaphor going,

2:35:20.020 --> 2:35:22.780
 Turtle Dove, Fledge.

2:35:22.780 --> 2:35:25.860
 But these systems have been very Googley,

2:35:25.860 --> 2:35:27.820
 kind of overengineered, and yet,

2:35:27.820 --> 2:35:29.260
 depending on differential privacy,

2:35:29.260 --> 2:35:31.420
 which has weakness over time, if you know how that works,

2:35:31.420 --> 2:35:34.260
 it's kind of injecting noise to hide you in a crowd,

2:35:34.260 --> 2:35:37.660
 but over time an adversary can pull you out of the crowd.

2:35:37.660 --> 2:35:39.380
 This doesn't look like it's gonna become a standard.

2:35:39.380 --> 2:35:42.740
 Like Apple, Brave, Mozilla, we're not gonna just say,

2:35:42.740 --> 2:35:44.700
 oh, Google, you saved us.

2:35:44.700 --> 2:35:46.060
 You've invented the Privacy Sandbox,

2:35:46.060 --> 2:35:47.660
 so we'll all just adopt it.

2:35:47.660 --> 2:35:48.580
 Not gonna be that easy.

2:35:48.580 --> 2:35:51.540
 It's gonna be more like pieces of what we do in Brave,

2:35:51.540 --> 2:35:54.420
 the synonymous ad matching or the blind signature

2:35:54.420 --> 2:35:57.020
 cryptography we use to confirm the ad impressions.

2:35:57.020 --> 2:35:59.260
 That's David Chow's invention.

2:35:59.260 --> 2:36:00.340
 That could get standardized.

2:36:00.340 --> 2:36:02.220
 In fact, some of that is being standardized.

2:36:02.220 --> 2:36:04.460
 Even Google's in favor of so called trust tokens,

2:36:04.460 --> 2:36:07.460
 which are Chowmian blind signature certs.

2:36:07.460 --> 2:36:09.300
 But they're not using them for ad confirmations

2:36:09.300 --> 2:36:11.460
 because they don't wanna blow up their own business.

2:36:11.460 --> 2:36:14.740
 And they need to let some of the publishers they serve

2:36:14.740 --> 2:36:17.340
 have other ad tech scripts on the page.

2:36:17.340 --> 2:36:18.620
 And so they're kind of caught.

2:36:18.620 --> 2:36:19.860
 And this is something I realized doing Brave.

2:36:19.860 --> 2:36:22.900
 I thought, what's Google's innovators dilemma

2:36:22.900 --> 2:36:26.300
 apart from just being mature and having trouble innovating?

2:36:26.300 --> 2:36:30.620
 It's that they have come to depend on this ad tech system

2:36:30.620 --> 2:36:34.980
 that has all these vendors that publishers rely on

2:36:34.980 --> 2:36:36.380
 because publishers aren't technical enough.

2:36:36.380 --> 2:36:37.980
 And I feel for the publishers,

2:36:37.980 --> 2:36:39.900
 but I realized the users have to come first.

2:36:39.900 --> 2:36:43.700
 And if you give the users a better browser that's faster,

2:36:43.700 --> 2:36:46.220
 then you'll get enough users to give back

2:36:46.220 --> 2:36:47.700
 or support publishers.

2:36:47.700 --> 2:36:49.420
 The speed and the battery savings

2:36:49.420 --> 2:36:51.140
 and the data plan savings are significant.

2:36:51.140 --> 2:36:53.340
 There's so much bad JavaScript involved in ad tech

2:36:53.340 --> 2:36:55.740
 that if you block it, you sort of chop off

2:36:55.740 --> 2:36:57.500
 what's called the programmatic waterfall,

2:36:57.500 --> 2:36:59.140
 which chains a bunch of requests.

2:36:59.140 --> 2:37:01.220
 Yeah, that's one of the incredible things about Brave.

2:37:01.220 --> 2:37:03.220
 I guess you're saying you should attribute it

2:37:03.220 --> 2:37:06.620
 to the fact that the messy JavaScript, no offense.

2:37:06.620 --> 2:37:07.460
 No offense.

2:37:07.460 --> 2:37:08.300
 Not my solution.

2:37:08.300 --> 2:37:13.300
 I mean, Brave just feels faster.

2:37:13.900 --> 2:37:16.420
 Even then, I mean, Chrome was fast.

2:37:16.420 --> 2:37:18.420
 One of the things that it was like impressive

2:37:18.420 --> 2:37:21.620
 is it showed that browsers can be really fast

2:37:21.620 --> 2:37:24.260
 and Brave is even faster than that, which is incredible.

2:37:24.260 --> 2:37:26.940
 And it saves the network, which means data plan.

2:37:26.940 --> 2:37:29.420
 It saves battery because the radio consumes your battery

2:37:29.420 --> 2:37:31.140
 when it's running more to do those requests.

2:37:31.140 --> 2:37:32.940
 And it's just stunning how many there are.

2:37:32.940 --> 2:37:34.600
 Like some of my Google friends were like,

2:37:34.600 --> 2:37:35.860
 oh, that's just that bad site.

2:37:35.860 --> 2:37:36.700
 They'll fix it.

2:37:36.700 --> 2:37:38.580
 And you actually do a survey of web pages

2:37:38.580 --> 2:37:40.340
 that they're like mostly like that.

2:37:40.340 --> 2:37:42.460
 I know Google engineers could make everything

2:37:42.460 --> 2:37:44.300
 super efficient, but they can't,

2:37:44.300 --> 2:37:45.780
 especially in antitrust court, do it.

2:37:45.780 --> 2:37:48.460
 They cannot take over all the publishers and do that.

2:37:48.460 --> 2:37:51.780
 They're trying with accelerated mobile profile, AMP.

2:37:51.780 --> 2:37:53.460
 They're trying to pull publishers.

2:37:53.460 --> 2:37:54.620
 They're like, oh, you poor publishers

2:37:54.620 --> 2:37:56.900
 don't know how to make your pages fast.

2:37:56.900 --> 2:37:58.180
 Put them on our AMP system.

2:37:58.180 --> 2:38:00.660
 We'll give you extra placement in the search carousel.

2:38:00.660 --> 2:38:02.420
 That's an antitrust problem for one.

2:38:02.420 --> 2:38:04.340
 But it's also publishers we talk to hate it

2:38:04.340 --> 2:38:06.020
 because it degrades their brand.

2:38:06.020 --> 2:38:08.020
 Now they look like a gig writer wrote a piece

2:38:08.020 --> 2:38:12.140
 that's got Google's framing an AMP URL on top of it.

2:38:12.140 --> 2:38:13.340
 And they're trying to fix that too.

2:38:13.340 --> 2:38:16.340
 But it just looks like Google's Borgifying

2:38:16.340 --> 2:38:18.160
 all these publishers and they don't want to be plugged

2:38:18.160 --> 2:38:19.020
 into the Borg cube.

2:38:19.020 --> 2:38:22.040
 They want to build up their own brand and have loyal readers.

2:38:22.040 --> 2:38:25.580
 So, you know, I'm in favor of giving the users power

2:38:25.580 --> 2:38:28.740
 to help all the publishers and the little platoons

2:38:28.740 --> 2:38:29.580
 and the creators.

2:38:29.580 --> 2:38:30.860
 And so we talked about Patreon.

2:38:30.860 --> 2:38:31.980
 What about social networks?

2:38:31.980 --> 2:38:35.420
 Well, they're inherently like search, a global algorithm.

2:38:35.420 --> 2:38:37.100
 You're trying to find friends of friends.

2:38:37.100 --> 2:38:39.340
 You're doing the transitive closure of a graph

2:38:39.340 --> 2:38:41.700
 induced by this friend of relation.

2:38:41.700 --> 2:38:45.320
 But you should own your friend relation.

2:38:45.320 --> 2:38:46.980
 You should own your posts.

2:38:46.980 --> 2:38:48.660
 They shouldn't be owned by somebody else

2:38:48.660 --> 2:38:51.060
 who can take them down or censor them.

2:38:51.060 --> 2:38:52.540
 And your friend relations, you should be able

2:38:52.540 --> 2:38:54.220
 to find those friends on other networks.

2:38:54.220 --> 2:38:55.420
 And that's why I've tweeted about this.

2:38:55.420 --> 2:38:56.700
 I haven't built it yet.

2:38:56.700 --> 2:38:59.740
 What if the browser could keep track of those for you?

2:38:59.740 --> 2:39:03.500
 What if the browser could maybe combine Facebook and Twitter

2:39:03.500 --> 2:39:05.300
 and you could find your friends on both

2:39:05.300 --> 2:39:06.780
 and you could have a sort of multi.

2:39:06.780 --> 2:39:09.900
 So that relationship is not owned by Facebook or Twitter.

2:39:09.900 --> 2:39:12.020
 It's owned by you through the browser.

2:39:12.020 --> 2:39:14.020
 They'll have terms of use and they'll say they own it.

2:39:14.020 --> 2:39:17.000
 But if they zap you on one and you're still on the other,

2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:18.500
 your friends find you and the browser

2:39:18.500 --> 2:39:20.820
 could preserve a combined view.

2:39:20.820 --> 2:39:23.800
 You could resurrect almost across networks.

2:39:23.800 --> 2:39:26.600
 It's something I wanna maybe quickly ask you about.

2:39:26.600 --> 2:39:31.340
 On that front, there's been quite a lot of centralized,

2:39:31.340 --> 2:39:35.260
 we talked about Wall Street Bets and then Robinhood.

2:39:35.260 --> 2:39:39.300
 There's been centralized banning of different accounts

2:39:39.300 --> 2:39:42.620
 and removing like Parler, for example, from AWS

2:39:42.620 --> 2:39:46.740
 and this kind of overreach of centralized control.

2:39:46.740 --> 2:39:49.360
 Is your hope that it's possible to,

2:39:49.360 --> 2:39:51.300
 like what are your thoughts about that in general?

2:39:51.300 --> 2:39:54.480
 And then is it possible to create tools

2:39:54.480 --> 2:39:56.700
 that give individual people the power

2:39:56.700 --> 2:40:00.060
 to fight back against overreach of such control?

2:40:00.060 --> 2:40:02.660
 So we're talking about oligarchy, I do think.

2:40:02.660 --> 2:40:05.260
 And if it controls a nation state, that's formidable.

2:40:05.260 --> 2:40:08.220
 It's the tax and the police power, the military power.

2:40:08.220 --> 2:40:10.860
 It means that you may have the great firewall of China.

2:40:10.860 --> 2:40:13.380
 You may have people in China who are jailed

2:40:13.380 --> 2:40:14.880
 because of their tweets, right?

2:40:14.880 --> 2:40:15.740
 This is a serious threat.

2:40:15.740 --> 2:40:18.240
 I can't minimize it or say that we'll win.

2:40:18.240 --> 2:40:19.980
 I don't know how it's gonna go.

2:40:19.980 --> 2:40:21.660
 But I do think, like I said earlier

2:40:21.660 --> 2:40:24.000
 about the kind of reason people find ways around things.

2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:25.820
 The internet routes around censorship.

2:40:25.820 --> 2:40:28.820
 And this is not to endorse any particular bad faction.

2:40:28.820 --> 2:40:29.900
 One of the things that happens

2:40:29.900 --> 2:40:33.020
 when you try to wave the free speech flag too much,

2:40:33.020 --> 2:40:34.620
 you say, I'm not gonna censor anything

2:40:34.620 --> 2:40:37.900
 and you get colonized by terrible, terrible people.

2:40:37.900 --> 2:40:39.820
 I don't care if you call them neo Nazis,

2:40:39.820 --> 2:40:41.840
 some of them could be doing illegal things.

2:40:41.840 --> 2:40:44.020
 And you don't want them colonizing

2:40:44.020 --> 2:40:45.220
 because it'll ruin your reputation

2:40:45.220 --> 2:40:46.380
 and destroy your business.

2:40:46.380 --> 2:40:48.740
 So what you really want is that kind of

2:40:48.740 --> 2:40:51.580
 user first subsidiarity, that subjectivity.

2:40:51.580 --> 2:40:55.320
 I want my social networks to be composited

2:40:55.320 --> 2:40:57.100
 in some multi social user interface

2:40:57.100 --> 2:40:59.420
 where I don't lose track of people across networks.

2:40:59.420 --> 2:41:01.620
 And if they leave one or they get banned from one,

2:41:01.620 --> 2:41:02.520
 I can find them on another,

2:41:02.520 --> 2:41:04.360
 I can still sort of thread them together.

2:41:04.360 --> 2:41:05.200
 That's brilliant.

2:41:05.200 --> 2:41:07.740
 And this didn't happen because browsers

2:41:07.740 --> 2:41:10.060
 got captured by the central powers.

2:41:10.060 --> 2:41:10.900
 Why did they get captured?

2:41:10.900 --> 2:41:11.900
 Mostly because of search.

2:41:11.900 --> 2:41:13.740
 And search is a central algorithm.

2:41:13.740 --> 2:41:15.620
 So Larry Page said this too many years ago.

2:41:15.620 --> 2:41:17.960
 He said, with search, you're giving up a little privacy

2:41:17.960 --> 2:41:19.820
 by handing the query over to us.

2:41:19.820 --> 2:41:21.460
 And we'll error correct it.

2:41:21.460 --> 2:41:24.340
 Alan used to be a Google executive.

2:41:24.340 --> 2:41:25.600
 He said, oh yeah, we used to laugh.

2:41:25.600 --> 2:41:27.480
 They'd all be doing typos and they'd be typing

2:41:27.480 --> 2:41:28.320
 the wrong word.

2:41:28.320 --> 2:41:29.760
 And we'd be like, no dummy, type that query.

2:41:29.760 --> 2:41:31.340
 And it's like, okay Google,

2:41:31.340 --> 2:41:33.060
 might want to dial back that ego a little bit.

2:41:33.060 --> 2:41:35.260
 But yes, you do see all the queries

2:41:35.260 --> 2:41:37.340
 and you can improve them and you can find the best results.

2:41:37.340 --> 2:41:38.900
 And that was Google's forte.

2:41:38.900 --> 2:41:40.580
 When we did the Firefox deal in 2004,

2:41:40.580 --> 2:41:42.380
 Google was really good.

2:41:42.380 --> 2:41:46.260
 And over time, SEO, which is an adversarial game,

2:41:46.260 --> 2:41:48.580
 and Google itself buying all these companies

2:41:48.580 --> 2:41:50.100
 and crowding its own results page

2:41:50.100 --> 2:41:53.160
 with its own tied in stuff.

2:41:53.160 --> 2:41:54.000
 The YouTube.

2:41:54.000 --> 2:41:55.260
 It's a slippery slope that happens

2:41:55.260 --> 2:41:58.380
 when you have control over these kinds

2:41:58.380 --> 2:42:00.020
 of really important mechanisms.

2:42:00.020 --> 2:42:02.140
 Yeah, monopoly capitalism or cartel.

2:42:02.140 --> 2:42:05.300
 You get this with the Robin Hoods and the hedge funds.

2:42:05.300 --> 2:42:07.940
 You get sort of the money interests take over

2:42:07.940 --> 2:42:10.100
 and kind of abuse their power and wear out their welcome.

2:42:10.100 --> 2:42:11.940
 So how do you get around that?

2:42:11.940 --> 2:42:15.380
 You have to have either new land to go to,

2:42:15.380 --> 2:42:18.220
 which some people's ancestors, not mine,

2:42:18.220 --> 2:42:19.600
 did to found the country.

2:42:20.820 --> 2:42:22.780
 I'm mostly Irish, German.

2:42:22.780 --> 2:42:26.020
 You have new virtual space people go to

2:42:26.020 --> 2:42:30.300
 and that requires an ISP or a colo center

2:42:30.300 --> 2:42:32.060
 or Amazon to host you.

2:42:32.060 --> 2:42:35.980
 It requires domain name registrar who will not strike you.

2:42:35.980 --> 2:42:38.300
 And so when Parler was taken down,

2:42:39.580 --> 2:42:40.860
 I thought that was egregious.

2:42:40.860 --> 2:42:42.980
 Parler, it was not well designed

2:42:42.980 --> 2:42:45.900
 and I tried it out because I tried all these things,

2:42:45.900 --> 2:42:46.740
 but I didn't use it.

2:42:46.740 --> 2:42:49.380
 And I also felt they were being unfairly scored

2:42:49.380 --> 2:42:51.780
 for not moderating because you can find tweets to this day

2:42:51.780 --> 2:42:54.640
 that are horrendous and threaten all sorts of violence.

2:42:54.640 --> 2:42:56.700
 Whereas Twitter, why isn't Twitter being taken down?

2:42:56.700 --> 2:42:57.640
 But so it was very selective.

2:42:57.640 --> 2:42:59.900
 It was the insiders who have the power

2:42:59.900 --> 2:43:01.660
 are gonna take out the newcomer.

2:43:01.660 --> 2:43:05.380
 And it looked bad, sort of like the hedge funds,

2:43:05.380 --> 2:43:08.060
 shorting GameStop, looked bad.

2:43:08.060 --> 2:43:10.060
 You're seeing a piece in Time Magazine this week

2:43:10.060 --> 2:43:11.340
 that's like basically saying,

2:43:11.340 --> 2:43:12.660
 yeah, we interfere with the election,

2:43:12.660 --> 2:43:14.580
 but it was great, aren't we good?

2:43:14.580 --> 2:43:16.620
 I don't know if you've seen this piece yet.

2:43:16.620 --> 2:43:18.980
 If you tried to say that as a Trump supporter

2:43:18.980 --> 2:43:21.500
 in November after the election,

2:43:21.500 --> 2:43:22.900
 you'd get banned from Twitter.

2:43:22.900 --> 2:43:25.980
 But now Time in its Twitter account is saying,

2:43:25.980 --> 2:43:30.260
 we saved the day, it's AFL, CIO and big business,

2:43:30.260 --> 2:43:32.060
 the Better Business Bureau got together

2:43:32.060 --> 2:43:34.980
 and kept Trump from spreading fake news.

2:43:34.980 --> 2:43:36.860
 So the country's kind of broken.

2:43:36.860 --> 2:43:37.820
 I don't know how to fix that.

2:43:37.820 --> 2:43:40.180
 The oligarchs have run wild in my opinion.

2:43:40.180 --> 2:43:42.780
 And big tech is in the antitrust dock.

2:43:42.780 --> 2:43:43.740
 What's gonna happen?

2:43:43.740 --> 2:43:44.780
 I don't think they get out.

2:43:44.780 --> 2:43:47.900
 I think some of the DOJ and certainly the state cases,

2:43:47.900 --> 2:43:49.060
 because they're separate cases,

2:43:49.060 --> 2:43:50.100
 are not gonna go away just

2:43:50.100 --> 2:43:52.420
 because somebody got elected differently.

2:43:52.420 --> 2:43:53.900
 And these are career prosecutors

2:43:53.900 --> 2:43:55.940
 and they have a strong case.

2:43:55.940 --> 2:43:56.780
 And Google's smart.

2:43:56.780 --> 2:43:59.620
 And Microsoft almost got split up, right?

2:43:59.620 --> 2:44:02.780
 The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, he overreached.

2:44:02.780 --> 2:44:05.020
 He didn't hold a hearing about the remedy.

2:44:05.020 --> 2:44:06.820
 He just said, I'm gonna break you up.

2:44:06.820 --> 2:44:10.580
 And Microsoft appealed and the higher level court said,

2:44:10.580 --> 2:44:11.660
 go back and figure this out.

2:44:11.660 --> 2:44:12.480
 You're not breaking them up.

2:44:12.480 --> 2:44:13.700
 You didn't even hold a hearing.

2:44:13.700 --> 2:44:15.460
 And when they got back, Microsoft said,

2:44:15.460 --> 2:44:17.660
 let's settle, let's settle, we don't wanna get broken up.

2:44:17.660 --> 2:44:20.500
 Because Jackson was gonna make the Opsco,

2:44:20.500 --> 2:44:21.620
 the operating system company,

2:44:21.620 --> 2:44:24.780
 and the Appsco office, you know, Word and Excel.

2:44:24.780 --> 2:44:28.500
 And that would have been a huge blow to Microsoft, so.

2:44:28.500 --> 2:44:31.140
 But ultimately, I don't know if you're optimistic

2:44:31.140 --> 2:44:34.540
 or cynical about the possibility of breaking up big tech.

2:44:34.540 --> 2:44:39.540
 To me, I'm optimistic that tools like Brave,

2:44:40.060 --> 2:44:42.100
 I love the idea of owning your friendships.

2:44:42.100 --> 2:44:44.660
 Like users more and more owning the stuff

2:44:44.660 --> 2:44:46.460
 is the only real way.

2:44:46.460 --> 2:44:48.540
 Unfortunately, it's like the WallStreetBets subreddit

2:44:48.540 --> 2:44:51.100
 is the only real way to fight decentralized power.

2:44:51.100 --> 2:44:52.700
 You can't break them up with the regulation.

2:44:52.700 --> 2:44:53.540
 It's very difficult.

2:44:53.540 --> 2:44:55.220
 Certainly don't wanna wait for the law.

2:44:55.220 --> 2:44:57.660
 Netscape was long dead or acquired by AOL

2:44:57.660 --> 2:44:58.500
 and effectively dead.

2:44:58.500 --> 2:45:01.980
 It was only Mozilla that returned Firefox to the market

2:45:01.980 --> 2:45:04.140
 by the time that the US v. Microsoft case

2:45:04.140 --> 2:45:07.180
 was finally settled and the penalties were put in place.

2:45:07.180 --> 2:45:11.020
 And yet, antitrust has a role to play.

2:45:11.020 --> 2:45:12.660
 Those penalties caused Microsoft

2:45:12.660 --> 2:45:14.220
 to kind of turn away from the web.

2:45:14.220 --> 2:45:16.060
 They did Windows Vista and they thought,

2:45:16.060 --> 2:45:16.900
 the web's too painful.

2:45:16.900 --> 2:45:19.700
 We got punished in court and we had to standardize things

2:45:19.700 --> 2:45:21.220
 with those icky standards people.

2:45:21.220 --> 2:45:23.460
 So they ran back to proprietary lock in

2:45:23.460 --> 2:45:24.660
 and Windows Vista flopped.

2:45:24.660 --> 2:45:26.620
 It was late, it was bloated.

2:45:26.620 --> 2:45:27.700
 Longhorn, remember?

2:45:27.700 --> 2:45:30.340
 Now, what I was gonna say, but Google's smart enough,

2:45:30.340 --> 2:45:31.620
 they won't get split up.

2:45:31.620 --> 2:45:34.860
 They'll split something out to get off the hook, I think.

2:45:35.780 --> 2:45:39.660
 This is a complicated subject, but I myself was so,

2:45:39.660 --> 2:45:43.220
 I decided to journey out from the world

2:45:43.220 --> 2:45:45.260
 of being a researcher at MIT

2:45:45.260 --> 2:45:48.340
 and potentially doing a startup myself.

2:45:48.340 --> 2:45:51.420
 And I've been thinking of, you know,

2:45:51.420 --> 2:45:53.660
 I wanted to come to Silicon Valley to do so.

2:45:53.660 --> 2:45:55.780
 It's the land of the entrepreneur.

2:45:55.780 --> 2:45:57.980
 And there's a lot of my friends,

2:45:57.980 --> 2:45:59.580
 a lot of them are successfully,

2:45:59.580 --> 2:46:01.380
 have been entrepreneurs themselves,

2:46:01.380 --> 2:46:03.580
 have said, do not come to Silicon Valley.

2:46:04.540 --> 2:46:09.100
 It'd be, you've started, you ran amazing teams of engineers.

2:46:09.100 --> 2:46:12.100
 You started a lot of successful businesses.

2:46:12.100 --> 2:46:15.860
 I wondered if you could comment on why a lot of people

2:46:15.860 --> 2:46:17.180
 are leaving California.

2:46:17.180 --> 2:46:19.780
 Is there something that could be fixed about California?

2:46:19.780 --> 2:46:22.700
 If you were starting a business today,

2:46:22.700 --> 2:46:24.780
 would you consider somewhere else,

2:46:24.780 --> 2:46:27.300
 like Austin or some other place?

2:46:27.300 --> 2:46:30.660
 Or is Silicon Valley still, is it just a little lull,

2:46:30.660 --> 2:46:34.100
 everybody's being overdramatic during this particular year

2:46:34.100 --> 2:46:35.820
 of the coronavirus and so on?

2:46:35.820 --> 2:46:39.220
 I think, you know, even Austin's getting overheated, I hear.

2:46:39.220 --> 2:46:42.420
 And I've had relatives and friends move to Texas

2:46:42.420 --> 2:46:43.260
 within the last few months.

2:46:43.260 --> 2:46:45.860
 So Texas as a whole is a big place.

2:46:45.860 --> 2:46:48.460
 And, you know, people are moving to Florida.

2:46:48.460 --> 2:46:50.700
 There's a big movement toward Miami,

2:46:50.700 --> 2:46:53.260
 Peter Thielke, these people.

2:46:53.260 --> 2:46:56.260
 The mayor has been very business friendly about it,

2:46:56.260 --> 2:46:58.460
 which I think is just good politics.

2:46:58.460 --> 2:47:00.660
 America is fundamentally a commercial republic.

2:47:00.660 --> 2:47:02.540
 So you would think this would be what's happening.

2:47:02.540 --> 2:47:04.420
 For a long time, California was the golden state.

2:47:04.420 --> 2:47:06.820
 I came here in late 76 when I was a teenager.

2:47:06.820 --> 2:47:11.380
 So it's in crushing debt due to the lockdowns.

2:47:11.380 --> 2:47:13.460
 It's got the highest taxes.

2:47:13.460 --> 2:47:14.500
 That's got to matter.

2:47:14.500 --> 2:47:16.480
 People will do high taxes.

2:47:17.640 --> 2:47:21.580
 It's got likely fires every year because of the deadfall.

2:47:21.580 --> 2:47:22.780
 It's not global warming.

2:47:22.780 --> 2:47:24.220
 It's because the forests weren't managed

2:47:24.220 --> 2:47:26.860
 like they had been in the first part of the 20th century.

2:47:28.140 --> 2:47:31.100
 Just, I would say corruption at all levels,

2:47:31.100 --> 2:47:32.260
 especially up to the governor,

2:47:32.260 --> 2:47:34.460
 who famously was eating at the French Laundry

2:47:34.460 --> 2:47:36.740
 and claimed that the outside was inside.

2:47:36.740 --> 2:47:39.540
 And they wore masks off and it was great.

2:47:39.540 --> 2:47:42.300
 Do what I say, not what I do.

2:47:42.300 --> 2:47:45.380
 Rules for thee, but not for me.

2:47:45.380 --> 2:47:47.580
 When you see that in leadership,

2:47:47.580 --> 2:47:50.400
 people either run or they get rid of the leadership.

2:47:50.400 --> 2:47:51.420
 So there's a recall drive,

2:47:51.420 --> 2:47:53.500
 which is about to reach the threshold.

2:47:53.500 --> 2:47:56.140
 Or in the old days, they get their guns, right?

2:47:56.140 --> 2:47:57.580
 You don't put up with this junk.

2:47:57.580 --> 2:48:00.700
 But ultimately, the thing that made Silicon Valley

2:48:00.700 --> 2:48:04.600
 a special place, it gave freedom to young kids,

2:48:04.600 --> 2:48:08.100
 entrepreneurs, young minds, brave minds

2:48:08.100 --> 2:48:10.820
 to think bold, to try different stuff.

2:48:10.820 --> 2:48:12.940
 I mean, even if the taxes are high,

2:48:12.940 --> 2:48:15.540
 so outside of financial stuff, outside of all of that.

2:48:15.540 --> 2:48:16.980
 Housing's super expensive.

2:48:16.980 --> 2:48:17.820
 Housing's super.

2:48:17.820 --> 2:48:18.820
 So it's hard.

2:48:18.820 --> 2:48:19.660
 Okay, everything about startups is hard.

2:48:19.660 --> 2:48:22.820
 Peninsula was narrow and they didn't plan the roads, right?

2:48:22.820 --> 2:48:23.660
 Yeah.

2:48:23.660 --> 2:48:26.020
 They got rid of public transportation in LA,

2:48:26.020 --> 2:48:28.260
 like the Who Framed Roger Rabbit cartoon show.

2:48:28.260 --> 2:48:30.860
 They used to have trolley cars in Portland too.

2:48:30.860 --> 2:48:34.300
 The oil companies and the DOD conspired to build highways

2:48:34.300 --> 2:48:35.660
 and make cars dominant.

2:48:35.660 --> 2:48:37.420
 And the rights of way are long gone.

2:48:37.420 --> 2:48:39.740
 Like Elon's gonna go underground.

2:48:39.740 --> 2:48:40.740
 And I wish him well.

2:48:40.740 --> 2:48:42.780
 That's probably the only way to do it now.

2:48:42.780 --> 2:48:44.820
 But is it still a place,

2:48:44.820 --> 2:48:46.500
 do you think it's possible that Silicon Valley

2:48:46.500 --> 2:48:48.180
 is still a place where magic happens?

2:48:48.180 --> 2:48:49.500
 Where the next Google's built?

2:48:49.500 --> 2:48:53.580
 Where the next, I mean, Brave is built where?

2:48:53.580 --> 2:48:54.900
 I think all good things come to an end.

2:48:54.900 --> 2:48:56.660
 I think the problem is Silicon Valley

2:48:56.660 --> 2:48:58.820
 had strong network effects through Stanford,

2:48:58.820 --> 2:49:02.300
 through the angel investor networks and the wealth effect.

2:49:02.300 --> 2:49:05.220
 And originally you have to give the federal government credit

2:49:05.220 --> 2:49:07.300
 like the ARPANET was a government project.

2:49:07.300 --> 2:49:08.140
 Let's not kid ourselves.

2:49:08.140 --> 2:49:11.180
 This wasn't wild free market, libertarian capitalism.

2:49:11.180 --> 2:49:12.780
 This was all Cold War stuff.

2:49:14.020 --> 2:49:17.060
 You had out of the academia, you had Shockley

2:49:17.060 --> 2:49:20.140
 and then the Traders Aid and Fairchild and Intel.

2:49:21.060 --> 2:49:25.040
 But now, when's the last fab that was built in the Valley?

2:49:25.040 --> 2:49:26.880
 MicroUnity might've been the last, I don't know.

2:49:26.880 --> 2:49:27.720
 I haven't followed.

2:49:27.720 --> 2:49:31.340
 We built a fab in Sunnyvale and MicroUnity

2:49:31.340 --> 2:49:33.300
 in starting early 90s.

2:49:33.300 --> 2:49:35.580
 And now the fabs are overseas.

2:49:36.600 --> 2:49:38.820
 And the one thing that I would say

2:49:38.820 --> 2:49:40.640
 that the oligarchs have intentionally done

2:49:40.640 --> 2:49:44.220
 in both parties is sort of labor

2:49:44.220 --> 2:49:46.180
 and environmental protection law arbitrage

2:49:46.180 --> 2:49:47.580
 by going where the labor is cheaper

2:49:47.580 --> 2:49:49.460
 and the environmental laws aren't as strict.

2:49:49.460 --> 2:49:52.020
 And that's polluted the hell out of parts of China,

2:49:52.020 --> 2:49:54.940
 but it's made things, you can make cheaper junk.

2:49:54.940 --> 2:49:58.900
 And this is not a story that's over yet.

2:49:58.900 --> 2:50:00.740
 So what is Silicon Valley for now?

2:50:00.740 --> 2:50:03.300
 It's for the network effect, the brain trust

2:50:03.300 --> 2:50:08.300
 of who you know, the parties, the Stanford sort of network.

2:50:09.500 --> 2:50:11.860
 That's fragile too over time, I'm afraid.

2:50:11.860 --> 2:50:16.100
 Stanford, a lot of good professors are like,

2:50:16.100 --> 2:50:19.900
 they still filter mainly based on socioeconomic status,

2:50:19.900 --> 2:50:22.180
 but it's kind of a skate school.

2:50:22.180 --> 2:50:26.980
 I had a friend hired out of Harvard 20 years ago at Netscape

2:50:26.980 --> 2:50:28.860
 and we talked about Harvard and he said,

2:50:28.860 --> 2:50:30.700
 yeah, there's still professors who do great on the curve.

2:50:30.700 --> 2:50:32.340
 And I said, oh yeah, I don't think they're any doing that

2:50:32.340 --> 2:50:33.180
 at Stanford anymore.

2:50:33.180 --> 2:50:35.100
 And he said, yo, it was shocking.

2:50:35.100 --> 2:50:37.700
 Some of the students got Cs and Ds and they were crying.

2:50:37.700 --> 2:50:39.620
 It's like, yes, that's right, the precious deers

2:50:39.620 --> 2:50:42.420
 can't take that at Stanford, so they get As and Bs.

2:50:42.420 --> 2:50:46.260
 Now you look at China and people say what you all about China,

2:50:46.260 --> 2:50:49.700
 they prove Russia too, a lot of math science training,

2:50:49.700 --> 2:50:52.540
 a lot of engineering, a lot of people who are doing

2:50:52.540 --> 2:50:55.220
 their coursework to get the As and the Bs.

2:50:55.220 --> 2:50:59.940
 So I'm an American, I'm born on the 4th of July.

2:50:59.940 --> 2:51:00.780
 American, yeah.

2:51:00.780 --> 2:51:02.100
 4th of July, wow.

2:51:02.100 --> 2:51:03.940
 And America, as I say, fundamentally

2:51:03.940 --> 2:51:04.860
 is a commercial republic.

2:51:04.860 --> 2:51:06.340
 You can try to make it something else.

2:51:06.340 --> 2:51:09.020
 You can say it's the new Atlantis and mystify it.

2:51:09.020 --> 2:51:11.260
 You could talk about it in a more, I think, correct way,

2:51:11.260 --> 2:51:13.780
 which is 13 colonies that grew and then there's a lot

2:51:13.780 --> 2:51:16.740
 of local or original design anyway,

2:51:16.740 --> 2:51:18.820
 the federalist papers talk about this,

2:51:18.820 --> 2:51:20.660
 there's a lot of subsidiarity,

2:51:20.660 --> 2:51:23.940
 but that's been eroded over time.

2:51:23.940 --> 2:51:26.660
 And like I say, a lot of the offshoring is hurt.

2:51:26.660 --> 2:51:28.860
 So what happened with coronavirus?

2:51:28.860 --> 2:51:30.940
 People working from home, and at first it was funny

2:51:30.940 --> 2:51:33.540
 because I have friends at Google who used to grumble

2:51:33.540 --> 2:51:35.420
 that not only did they have to come into the office,

2:51:35.420 --> 2:51:37.340
 if they joined a different team that was centered

2:51:37.340 --> 2:51:39.100
 in a different office, they had to move.

2:51:39.100 --> 2:51:43.060
 Or if the VA team was reconstituted in Munich,

2:51:43.060 --> 2:51:46.700
 which it was after Lars Bock just got tired of JavaScript,

2:51:46.700 --> 2:51:48.780
 that they hired in Munich or they hired PhDs

2:51:48.780 --> 2:51:50.780
 in Germany and moved them to Munich.

2:51:50.780 --> 2:51:52.300
 With coronavirus, everyone's working from home

2:51:52.300 --> 2:51:53.940
 and it's like, what a relief, I can work for Google

2:51:53.940 --> 2:51:54.820
 from home.

2:51:54.820 --> 2:51:57.220
 But then the next shoe dropped and people started asking

2:51:57.220 --> 2:52:00.460
 Mark Zuckerberg, hey, can I move to my hometown

2:52:00.460 --> 2:52:01.580
 in the Midwest?

2:52:01.580 --> 2:52:02.420
 And he said, okay.

2:52:02.420 --> 2:52:05.100
 And they said, oh, can I keep getting my Silicon Valley pay?

2:52:05.100 --> 2:52:06.660
 No.

2:52:06.660 --> 2:52:08.500
 We're gonna figure out what your cost of living there is

2:52:08.500 --> 2:52:10.300
 and we're gonna adjust your pay accordingly.

2:52:10.300 --> 2:52:13.020
 And these colonies and these little mini experiments

2:52:13.020 --> 2:52:15.140
 that all combine to the big giant experiment,

2:52:15.140 --> 2:52:20.060
 I have a, I don't know, I have this vision of America,

2:52:20.060 --> 2:52:22.180
 which the country, I was born in Russia, like I said here,

2:52:22.180 --> 2:52:24.980
 and this is truly a wonderful country.

2:52:24.980 --> 2:52:27.500
 I wasn't born on the 4th of July, but I might as well be.

2:52:27.500 --> 2:52:28.340
 People still flee here.

2:52:28.340 --> 2:52:31.740
 I still, and I'm a red blooded American at this point.

2:52:31.740 --> 2:52:35.420
 And I have a sense that we figured it out somehow.

2:52:35.420 --> 2:52:37.940
 If Silicon Valley burns, another place will come up

2:52:37.940 --> 2:52:42.020
 in this place that even more innovation and people will move

2:52:42.020 --> 2:52:46.460
 and the remote work might change fundamentally how we work

2:52:46.460 --> 2:52:47.300
 or it might not.

2:52:47.300 --> 2:52:49.540
 It might just give you the freedom to then create

2:52:49.540 --> 2:52:52.220
 many other small Silicon Valleys throughout the place,

2:52:52.220 --> 2:52:54.940
 like Austin included, but other places as well.

2:52:54.940 --> 2:52:58.540
 And we somehow figured it out and...

2:52:58.540 --> 2:53:01.660
 I think that's true that there will be more mobility

2:53:01.660 --> 2:53:03.460
 and maybe new places that come up.

2:53:03.460 --> 2:53:07.940
 I don't know if Silicon Valley has passed some sell by date

2:53:07.940 --> 2:53:10.820
 because it did hurt.

2:53:10.820 --> 2:53:13.420
 The coronavirus hurt, the lockdowns hurt in the sense

2:53:13.420 --> 2:53:15.860
 that part of what keeps things going is social.

2:53:15.860 --> 2:53:18.300
 And so a lot of young people, even before coronavirus,

2:53:18.300 --> 2:53:19.660
 moved to San Francisco.

2:53:19.660 --> 2:53:21.660
 It was very strange to watch because in the 80s,

2:53:21.660 --> 2:53:24.860
 we all lived in the Valley and it was less populated

2:53:24.860 --> 2:53:26.060
 and San Francisco was grungier.

2:53:26.060 --> 2:53:28.620
 It was more like Dirty Harry in the 70s.

2:53:28.620 --> 2:53:31.660
 But by the 90s, and Jamie runs a nightclub there

2:53:31.660 --> 2:53:33.780
 and he's talked about this, you had sort of wealthy

2:53:33.780 --> 2:53:36.100
 tech people moving in south of market,

2:53:36.100 --> 2:53:37.780
 fancy townhouses being built.

2:53:37.780 --> 2:53:41.020
 And that's continued in such a point that it's almost like,

2:53:41.020 --> 2:53:43.540
 what's the movie by the South African director Nils Jody

2:53:43.540 --> 2:53:46.020
 Foster up in the space colony?

2:53:46.020 --> 2:53:48.180
 Matt Damon is the guy on the earth who has to go

2:53:48.180 --> 2:53:50.540
 up and anyway, it's about the stratification.

2:53:50.540 --> 2:53:52.060
 It's about the great inequality that people

2:53:52.060 --> 2:53:55.540
 in the space station have like amazing medical auto docs

2:53:55.540 --> 2:53:57.940
 that can extend their life or save them cure cancer.

2:53:57.940 --> 2:54:01.340
 People on earth are all suffering ground down in poverty.

2:54:02.820 --> 2:54:06.260
 And that sort of happened while I was here.

2:54:06.260 --> 2:54:10.660
 You saw a lot of money drive prices up

2:54:10.660 --> 2:54:12.540
 along the narrow peninsula and the single people

2:54:12.540 --> 2:54:14.540
 wanted nightlife so they were in the city

2:54:14.540 --> 2:54:16.700
 and the condos in the city got super expensive.

2:54:16.700 --> 2:54:20.660
 And I know even Google friends who are socially responsible

2:54:20.660 --> 2:54:22.820
 say we should have more housing built.

2:54:22.820 --> 2:54:25.860
 We should have yes in my backyard, not in my backyard.

2:54:25.860 --> 2:54:28.460
 But that's not happening as far as I can tell.

2:54:28.460 --> 2:54:32.540
 And from the government to the incumbent landowners

2:54:32.540 --> 2:54:34.500
 and renters, it's just not happening.

2:54:34.500 --> 2:54:37.500
 And that has to drive people away.

2:54:37.500 --> 2:54:40.500
 I appreciate that people come here and you should wait

2:54:40.500 --> 2:54:42.620
 for the prices to moderate, they will.

2:54:42.620 --> 2:54:47.360
 But a lot of people are gonna go where the prices are lower.

2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:50.340
 You, and sorry for silly questions here,

2:54:50.340 --> 2:54:54.380
 but just looking back, you have created things,

2:54:54.380 --> 2:54:56.540
 have been part of creating things

2:54:56.540 --> 2:55:00.740
 that have transformed this world, the world of technology,

2:55:00.740 --> 2:55:02.740
 perhaps more than almost anything else.

2:55:04.820 --> 2:55:07.580
 But you're still a human being

2:55:07.580 --> 2:55:10.900
 and unfortunately this ride ends.

2:55:10.900 --> 2:55:13.780
 Do you ever think about your own mortality?

2:55:13.780 --> 2:55:17.460
 Not too much, I mean, I'm a Roman Catholic

2:55:17.460 --> 2:55:19.220
 so I am not afraid of death.

2:55:19.220 --> 2:55:24.220
 I think a lot of people who have problems with death

2:55:25.140 --> 2:55:30.140
 are suffering from some lack of either faith

2:55:30.700 --> 2:55:33.380
 in their transcending death or maybe they don't have

2:55:33.380 --> 2:55:37.260
 children or they feel like they get later in life

2:55:37.260 --> 2:55:39.220
 and they feel like they've missed opportunities

2:55:39.220 --> 2:55:40.620
 to do something that endures.

2:55:40.620 --> 2:55:43.540
 And I sympathize with a lot because I'm old,

2:55:43.540 --> 2:55:46.440
 I got married fairly old, so I understand all that.

2:55:46.440 --> 2:55:49.360
 Nothing human is alien to me as Terrence said.

2:55:50.820 --> 2:55:54.100
 But I don't fear it, no.

2:55:54.100 --> 2:55:56.300
 What do you hope your legacy is?

2:55:56.300 --> 2:55:57.740
 Yeah, it's gonna be JavaScript.

2:55:57.740 --> 2:56:01.100
 I think, no, I think my legacy has more to do

2:56:01.100 --> 2:56:03.540
 with my children and their children.

2:56:03.540 --> 2:56:06.460
 I think it also has to do with web standards,

2:56:06.460 --> 2:56:08.340
 it has to do with things like Brave,

2:56:08.340 --> 2:56:10.060
 the things we did with Firefox.

2:56:10.060 --> 2:56:13.100
 When we did, I'm not gonna oversell Brave

2:56:13.100 --> 2:56:15.140
 but I think Brave is important and we'll continue

2:56:15.140 --> 2:56:16.780
 to prove this in a way that counts

2:56:16.780 --> 2:56:18.120
 for many decades to come.

2:56:18.120 --> 2:56:21.420
 But even Firefox, whatever its future fortune,

2:56:21.420 --> 2:56:23.300
 showed you can restart the browser market.

2:56:23.300 --> 2:56:26.180
 This thing you said about people opting out

2:56:26.180 --> 2:56:28.600
 and routing around, you don't need everybody to do that.

2:56:28.600 --> 2:56:31.220
 It's more like Taleb's stubborn minorities that do that.

2:56:31.220 --> 2:56:33.640
 It's the lead users, Erfron Hipple's lead users.

2:56:33.640 --> 2:56:36.100
 You can be a few percent, you can tilt the market.

2:56:36.100 --> 2:56:39.380
 And that can be done in spite of the incumbents,

2:56:39.380 --> 2:56:41.540
 of moneyed interests not being in favor of what you're doing.

2:56:41.540 --> 2:56:45.260
 So I think what we do with Firefox won't be forgotten

2:56:45.260 --> 2:56:47.140
 and it needs to be done more and we're doing it with Brave.

2:56:47.140 --> 2:56:48.780
 And you could argue that other projects are doing it.

2:56:48.780 --> 2:56:50.780
 In some ways, blockchain is doing it.

2:56:50.780 --> 2:56:55.780
 The Robinhood, take down the use of Robinhood

2:56:56.100 --> 2:56:59.100
 by the Wall Street Bets kids, similar.

2:56:59.100 --> 2:57:01.300
 So yeah, that kind of spirit endures.

2:57:01.300 --> 2:57:04.180
 And I think it, in some ways it's American, right?

2:57:04.180 --> 2:57:06.540
 It's not hard revolutionary.

2:57:06.540 --> 2:57:08.780
 It's not trying to burn the past and destroy everything.

2:57:08.780 --> 2:57:13.780
 It's more like we have these certain, let's say rights.

2:57:15.140 --> 2:57:16.180
 We have duties too.

2:57:16.180 --> 2:57:17.780
 So there's some debate about which comes first

2:57:17.780 --> 2:57:20.360
 in American jurisprudence and the founding documents.

2:57:20.360 --> 2:57:23.020
 But as long as things are working,

2:57:23.020 --> 2:57:25.900
 we'll be like pragmatic Americans,

2:57:25.900 --> 2:57:29.300
 like de Tocqueville described in his writings.

2:57:29.300 --> 2:57:32.620
 But if things get too out of whack for one reason or another,

2:57:32.620 --> 2:57:35.540
 too unequal, too oligarchic and abusive,

2:57:35.540 --> 2:57:37.060
 we're gonna start our rights.

2:57:37.060 --> 2:57:38.860
 And even a few of us can do it.

2:57:38.860 --> 2:57:40.460
 And even in the American Revolution,

2:57:40.460 --> 2:57:44.100
 it was the minority who fought and put their lives,

2:57:44.100 --> 2:57:45.620
 treasure and sacred honor at stake.

2:57:45.620 --> 2:57:48.860
 It was a bunch of people went to upper Canada,

2:57:48.860 --> 2:57:51.140
 I think it was called, Ontario.

2:57:51.140 --> 2:57:52.860
 Yeah, that's the beautiful, I mean,

2:57:52.860 --> 2:57:55.100
 that is at the core where your work stands for

2:57:55.100 --> 2:57:58.180
 is that a few people can have the power

2:57:58.180 --> 2:58:01.580
 to transform society with just a few radical ideas,

2:58:01.580 --> 2:58:04.580
 with just a little bit of code, change the world.

2:58:04.580 --> 2:58:05.420
 Gotta do it.

2:58:05.420 --> 2:58:06.240
 And that's empowering.

2:58:06.240 --> 2:58:07.220
 That is the American way.

2:58:07.220 --> 2:58:09.380
 That's why this country is, I believe,

2:58:09.380 --> 2:58:10.460
 the greatest country on Earth.

2:58:10.460 --> 2:58:13.040
 That's not over, or Matt says it too much,

2:58:13.040 --> 2:58:15.900
 but I think some special things

2:58:15.900 --> 2:58:17.580
 have already happened in this country

2:58:17.580 --> 2:58:18.800
 and will continue to happen.

2:58:18.800 --> 2:58:19.640
 And that's really exciting.

2:58:19.640 --> 2:58:22.520
 And that spirit can continue no matter who comes here.

2:58:22.520 --> 2:58:25.520
 They can adopt those folkways and that spirit.

2:58:25.520 --> 2:58:27.580
 Brandon, I can't tell you how much,

2:58:27.580 --> 2:58:29.540
 I was freaking out how much of an honor it is

2:58:29.540 --> 2:58:30.380
 to talk to you.

2:58:30.380 --> 2:58:31.420
 You're an incredible human being.

2:58:31.420 --> 2:58:33.580
 It's one of my favorite conversations ever.

2:58:33.580 --> 2:58:35.660
 Thank you so much for wasting all this time with me.

2:58:35.660 --> 2:58:36.580
 I really appreciate it.

2:58:36.580 --> 2:58:38.060
 Oh, it seems like a breeze.

2:58:38.060 --> 2:58:38.880
 My pleasure.

2:59:00.720 --> 2:59:03.700
 Any app that can be written in JavaScript

2:59:03.700 --> 2:59:06.980
 will eventually be written in JavaScript.

2:59:06.980 --> 2:59:33.980
