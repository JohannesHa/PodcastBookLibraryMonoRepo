00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
 The following is a conversation with Richard Dawkins,

00:03.120 --> 00:07.040
 an evolutionary biologist and author of The Selfish Gene,

00:07.040 --> 00:11.040
 The Blind Watchmaker, The God Delusion, The Magic of Reality,

00:11.040 --> 00:15.680
 and The Greatest Show of Earth and his latest All Growing God.

00:15.680 --> 00:21.680
 He is the originator and popularizer of a lot of fascinating ideas in evolutionary biology

00:21.680 --> 00:26.320
 and science in general, including, funny enough, the introduction of the word

00:26.320 --> 00:32.960
 meme in his 1976 book, The Selfish Gene, which, in the context of a gene centered view of evolution,

00:32.960 --> 00:39.280
 is an exceptionally powerful idea. He's outspoken, bold, and often fearless in the

00:39.280 --> 00:45.040
 defense of science and reason, and in this way, is one of the most influential thinkers of our time.

00:46.800 --> 00:50.320
 This conversation was recorded before the outbreak of the pandemic.

00:50.320 --> 00:54.480
 For everyone feeling the medical, psychological, and financial burden of this crisis,

00:54.480 --> 00:59.760
 I'm sending love your way. Stay strong. We're in this together. We'll beat this thing.

01:00.800 --> 01:05.280
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

01:05.280 --> 01:10.800
 review it with 5 stars on Apple Podcast, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter

01:10.800 --> 01:16.720
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N. As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now,

01:16.720 --> 01:20.480
 and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation.

01:20.480 --> 01:25.360
 I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

01:25.360 --> 01:29.600
 This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.

01:29.600 --> 01:34.720
 When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST. Cash App lets you send money to friends,

01:34.720 --> 01:38.560
 buy bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with as little as one dollar.

01:39.120 --> 01:43.120
 Since Cash App allows you to send and receive money digitally, peer to peer,

01:43.120 --> 01:48.080
 security in all digital transactions is very important. Let me mention the PCI

01:48.080 --> 01:53.520
 data security standard that Cash App is compliant with. I'm a big fan of standards for safety and

01:53.520 --> 02:00.240
 security. PCI DSS is a good example of that, where a bunch of competitors got together and agreed

02:00.240 --> 02:03.840
 that there needs to be a global standard around the security of transactions.

02:04.400 --> 02:08.960
 Now we just need to do the same for autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence systems in

02:08.960 --> 02:14.560
 general. So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use the code LEX

02:14.560 --> 02:19.360
 PODCAST, you get ten dollars and Cash App will also donate ten dollars to FIRST,

02:19.360 --> 02:23.840
 an organization that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people

02:23.840 --> 02:29.760
 around the world. And now, here's my conversation with Richard Dawkins.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.520
 Do you think there's intelligent life out there in the universe?

02:34.640 --> 02:40.000
 Well, if we accept that there's intelligent life here and we accept that the number of planets in

02:40.000 --> 02:45.600
 the universe is gigantic, I mean, 10 to the 22 stars has been estimated, it seems to me highly

02:45.600 --> 02:51.760
 likely that there is not only life in the universe elsewhere, but also intelligent life. If you deny

02:51.760 --> 02:55.600
 that, then you're committed to the view that the things that happened on this planet are

02:55.600 --> 03:02.080
 staggeringly improbable, I mean, ludicrously off the charts improbable. And I don't think it's that

03:02.080 --> 03:06.480
 improbable. Certainly the origin of life itself, there are really two steps, the origin of life,

03:06.480 --> 03:11.520
 which is probably fairly improbable, and then the subsequent evolution to intelligent life,

03:11.520 --> 03:15.360
 which is also fairly improbable. So the juxtaposition of those two, you could say,

03:15.360 --> 03:20.960
 is pretty improbable, but not 10 to the 22 improbable. It's an interesting question,

03:20.960 --> 03:25.200
 maybe you're coming on to it, how we would recognize intelligence from outer space if we

03:25.840 --> 03:30.640
 encountered it. The most likely way we would come across them would be by radio. It's highly

03:30.640 --> 03:38.240
 unlikely they'd ever visit us. But it's not that unlikely that we would pick up radio signals,

03:38.880 --> 03:42.960
 and then we would have to have some means of deciding that it was intelligent.

03:44.800 --> 03:50.000
 People involved in the SETI program discuss how they would do it, and things like prime numbers

03:50.000 --> 03:56.800
 would be an obvious way for them to broadcast, to say, we are intelligent, we are here.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.440
 I suspect it probably would be obvious, actually.

03:59.440 --> 04:03.920
 Well, that's interesting, prime numbers, so the mathematical patterns, it's an open question

04:03.920 --> 04:10.000
 whether mathematics is the same for us as it would be for aliens. I suppose we could assume

04:10.720 --> 04:15.680
 that ultimately, if we're governed by the same laws of physics, then we should be governed by

04:15.680 --> 04:17.040
 the same laws of mathematics.

04:17.040 --> 04:22.160
 I think so. I suspect that they will have Pythagoras theorem, etc. I don't think their

04:22.160 --> 04:23.680
 mathematics will be that different.

04:23.680 --> 04:27.760
 Do you think evolution would also be a force on the alien planets as well?

04:27.760 --> 04:33.440
 I stuck my neck out and said that if ever that we do discover life elsewhere, it will be Darwinian

04:33.440 --> 04:41.120
 life, in the sense that it will work by some kind of natural selection, the nonrandom survival of

04:41.120 --> 04:47.040
 randomly generated codes. It doesn't mean that the genetic, it would have to have some kind of

04:47.040 --> 04:51.200
 genetics, but it doesn't have to be DNA genetics, probably wouldn't be actually.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.840
 But I think it would have to be Darwinian, yes.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.760
 So some kind of selection process.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.280
 Yes, in the general sense, it would be Darwinian.

05:00.320 --> 05:05.840
 So let me ask kind of an artificial intelligence engineering question. So you've been an

05:05.840 --> 05:11.200
 outspoken critic of, I guess, what could be called intelligent design, which is an attempt

05:11.200 --> 05:16.400
 to describe the creation of a human mind and body by some religious folks, religious folks

05:16.400 --> 05:23.120
 used to describe. So broadly speaking, evolution is, as far as I know, again, you can correct me,

05:23.120 --> 05:27.600
 is the only scientific theory we have for the development of intelligent life. Like there's no

05:27.600 --> 05:30.240
 alternative theory, as far as I understand.

05:30.240 --> 05:33.600
 None has ever been suggested, and I suspect it never will be.

05:35.520 --> 05:39.280
 Well, of course, whenever somebody says that, a hundred years later.

05:39.280 --> 05:42.240
 I know. It's a risk.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.040
 It's a risk.

05:43.040 --> 05:48.880
 It's a risk. But what a bet. I mean, I'm pretty confident.

05:48.880 --> 05:53.760
 But it would look, sorry, yes, it would probably look very similar, but it's almost like Einstein

05:53.760 --> 05:59.840
 general relativity versus Newtonian physics. It'll be maybe an alteration of the theory or

05:59.840 --> 06:02.720
 something like that, but it won't be fundamentally different. But okay.

06:06.320 --> 06:11.040
 So now for the past 70 years, even before the AI community has been trying to engineer

06:11.040 --> 06:18.000
 intelligence, in a sense, to do what intelligent design says, you know, was done here on earth.

06:18.720 --> 06:26.000
 What's your intuition? Do you think it's possible to build intelligence, to build computers that

06:26.000 --> 06:31.200
 are intelligent, or do we need to do something like the evolutionary process? Like there's

06:31.200 --> 06:32.320
 no shortcuts here.

06:33.360 --> 06:38.960
 That's an interesting question. I'm committed to the belief that is ultimately possible

06:38.960 --> 06:43.520
 because I think there's nothing nonphysical in our brains. I think our brains work by

06:44.160 --> 06:49.280
 the laws of physics. And so it must, in principle, it'd be possible to replicate that.

06:49.280 --> 06:54.480
 In practice, though, it might be very difficult. And as you suggest, it may be the only way

06:54.480 --> 06:59.280
 to do it is by something like an evolutionary process. I'd be surprised. I suspect that

06:59.280 --> 07:05.040
 it will come, but it's certainly been slower in coming than some of the early pioneers

07:05.040 --> 07:06.240
 thought it would be.

07:06.240 --> 07:12.160
 Yeah. But in your sense, is the evolutionary process efficient? So you can see it as exceptionally

07:12.160 --> 07:17.120
 wasteful in one perspective, but at the same time, maybe that is the only path.

07:17.120 --> 07:22.320
 It's a paradox, isn't it? I mean, on the one side, it is deplorably wasteful. It's

07:22.320 --> 07:26.880
 fundamentally based on waste. On the other hand, it does produce magnificent results.

07:26.880 --> 07:38.320
 I mean, the design of a soaring bird, an albatross, a vulture, an eagle, is superb. An engineer

07:38.320 --> 07:41.200
 would be proud to have done it. On the other hand, an engineer would not be proud to have

07:41.200 --> 07:46.800
 done some of the other things that evolution has served up. Some of the sort of botched

07:46.800 --> 07:51.600
 jobs that you can easily understand because of their historical origins, but they don't

07:51.600 --> 07:52.560
 look well designed.

07:52.560 --> 07:55.680
 Do you have examples of bad design?

07:55.680 --> 07:59.600
 My favorite example is the recurrent laryngeal nerve. I've used this many times. This is

07:59.600 --> 08:04.880
 a nerve. It's one of the cranial nerves, which goes from the brain, and the end organ is

08:04.880 --> 08:10.160
 that it supplies is the voice box, the larynx. But it doesn't go straight to the larynx.

08:10.160 --> 08:15.520
 It goes right down into the chest and then loops around an artery in the chest and then

08:15.520 --> 08:21.040
 comes straight back up again to the larynx. And I've assisted in the dissection of a

08:21.040 --> 08:27.120
 giraffe's neck, which happened to have died in a zoo. And we saw the recurrent laryngeal

08:27.120 --> 08:32.880
 nerve whizzing straight past the larynx, within an inch of the larynx, down into the chest,

08:32.880 --> 08:41.120
 and then back up again, which is a detour of many feet. Very, very inefficient.

08:41.120 --> 08:46.880
 The reason is historical. The ancestors are fish ancestors, the ancestors of all mammals

08:46.880 --> 08:54.560
 and fish. The most direct pathway of that, of the equivalent of that nerve, there wasn't

08:54.560 --> 08:59.840
 a larynx in those days, but it innervated part of the gills. The most direct pathway

08:59.840 --> 09:06.240
 was behind that artery. And then when the mammal, when the tetrapods, when the land

09:06.240 --> 09:12.640
 vertebrae started evolving, and then the neck started to stretch, the marginal cost of changing

09:12.640 --> 09:17.920
 the embryological design to jump that nerve over the artery was too great. Or rather,

09:19.680 --> 09:24.880
 each step of the way was a very small cost, but the cost of actually jumping it over would have

09:24.880 --> 09:31.680
 been very large. As the neck lengthened, it was a negligible change to just increase the length of

09:31.680 --> 09:35.120
 the detour a tiny bit, a tiny bit, a tiny bit, each millimeter at a time, didn't make any difference.

09:35.920 --> 09:40.960
 But finally, when you get to a giraffe, it's a huge detour and no doubt is very inefficient.

09:40.960 --> 09:47.600
 Now that's bad design. Any engineer would reject that piece of design. It's ridiculous.

09:47.600 --> 09:52.000
 And there are quite a number of examples, as you'd expect. It's not surprising that we find

09:52.000 --> 09:55.840
 examples of that sort. In a way, what's surprising is there aren't more of them. In a way, what's

09:55.840 --> 10:01.200
 surprising is that the design of living things is so good. So natural selection manages to achieve

10:01.200 --> 10:11.600
 excellent results, partly by tinkering, partly by coming along and cleaning up initial mistakes and,

10:11.600 --> 10:17.040
 as it were, making the best of a bad job. That's really interesting. I mean, it is surprising and

10:17.040 --> 10:22.880
 beautiful and it's a mystery from an engineering perspective that so many things are well designed.

10:22.880 --> 10:30.240
 I suppose the thing we're forgetting is how many generations have to die for that.

10:30.240 --> 10:33.360
 That's the inefficiency of it. Yes, that's the horrible wastefulness of it.

10:33.360 --> 10:38.240
 So yeah, we marvel at the final product, but yeah, the process is painful.

10:39.600 --> 10:45.600
 Elon Musk describes human beings as potentially what he calls the biological bootloader for

10:45.600 --> 10:50.720
 artificial intelligence or artificial general intelligence is used as the term. It's kind of

10:50.720 --> 10:57.520
 like super intelligence. Do you see superhuman level intelligence as potentially the next step

10:57.520 --> 11:02.080
 in the evolutionary process? Yes, I think that if superhuman intelligence is to be found,

11:02.080 --> 11:07.280
 it will be artificial. I don't have any hope that we ourselves, our brains will go on

11:09.200 --> 11:16.560
 getting larger in ordinary biological evolution. I think that's probably come to an end. It is

11:16.560 --> 11:22.720
 the dominant trend or one of the dominant trends in our fossil history for the last two or three

11:22.720 --> 11:28.960
 million years. Brain size? Brain size, yes. So it's been swelling rather dramatically over the last

11:28.960 --> 11:35.040
 two or three million years. That is unlikely to continue. The only way that happens is because

11:35.040 --> 11:41.840
 natural selection favors those individuals with the biggest brains and that's not happening anymore.

11:41.840 --> 11:48.400
 Right. So in general, in humans, the selection pressures are not, I mean, are they active in

11:48.400 --> 11:56.080
 any form? Well, in order for them to be active, it would be necessary that the most, let's call it

11:56.080 --> 12:02.240
 intelligence. Not that intelligence is simply correlated with brain size, but let's talk about

12:02.240 --> 12:08.000
 intelligence. In order for that to evolve, it's necessary that the most intelligent beings have

12:08.000 --> 12:17.200
 the most, individuals have the most children. And so intelligence may buy you money, it may buy you

12:17.200 --> 12:22.240
 worldly success, it may buy you a nice house and a nice car and things like that if you have a

12:22.240 --> 12:29.760
 successful career. It may buy you the admiration of your fellow people, but it doesn't increase the

12:29.760 --> 12:35.440
 number of offspring that you have. It doesn't increase your genetic legacy to the next generation.

12:35.440 --> 12:42.000
 On the other hand, artificial intelligence, I mean, computers and technology generally, is

12:42.000 --> 12:48.880
 is evolving by a non genetic means, by leaps and bounds, of course. And so what do you think,

12:48.880 --> 12:52.560
 I don't know if you're familiar, there's a company called Neuralink, but there's a general effort of

12:52.560 --> 12:59.360
 brain computer interfaces, which is to try to build a connection between the computer and the brain

12:59.360 --> 13:05.840
 to send signals both directions. And the long term dream there is to do exactly that, which is expand,

13:05.840 --> 13:12.000
 I guess, expand the size of the brain, expand the capabilities of the brain. Do you see this as

13:12.000 --> 13:18.000
 interesting? Do you see this as a promising possible technology? Or is the interface between

13:18.000 --> 13:22.320
 the computer and the brain, like the brain is this wet, messy thing that's just impossible to

13:22.320 --> 13:27.200
 interface with? Well, of course, it's interesting, whether it's promising, I'm really not qualified

13:27.200 --> 13:34.320
 to say. What I do find puzzling is that the brain being as small as it is compared to a computer and

13:34.320 --> 13:40.240
 the individual components being as slow as they are compared to our electronic components,

13:40.240 --> 13:47.840
 it is astonishing what it can do. I mean, imagine building a computer that fits into the size of a

13:47.840 --> 13:57.760
 human skull. And with the equivalent of transistors or integrated circuits, which work as slowly as

13:57.760 --> 14:04.960
 neurons do. It's something mysterious about that, something, something must be going on that we

14:04.960 --> 14:11.200
 don't understand. So I have just talked to Roger Penrose, I'm not sure you're familiar with his

14:11.200 --> 14:20.640
 work. And he also describes this kind of mystery in the mind, in the brain, that as he sees a

14:20.640 --> 14:27.120
 materialist, so there's no sort of mystical thing going on. But there's so much about the material

14:27.120 --> 14:32.800
 of the brain that we don't understand. That might be quantum mechanical in nature and so on. So

14:32.800 --> 14:37.760
 there the idea is about consciousness. Do you have any, have you ever thought about, do you ever

14:37.760 --> 14:42.800
 think about ideas of consciousness or a little bit more about the mystery of intelligence and

14:42.800 --> 14:48.000
 consciousness that seems to pop up just like you're saying from our brain? I agree with Roger

14:48.000 --> 14:55.600
 Penrose that there is a mystery there. I mean, he's one of the world's greatest physicists. I

14:55.600 --> 15:00.800
 can't possibly argue with his... But nobody knows anything about consciousness. And in fact,

15:02.320 --> 15:10.720
 if we talk about religion and so on, the mystery of consciousness is so awe inspiring and we know

15:10.720 --> 15:16.240
 so little about it that the leap to sort of religious or mystical explanations is too easy

15:16.240 --> 15:21.360
 to make. I think that it's just an act of cowardice to leap to religious explanations and

15:21.360 --> 15:28.400
 Roger doesn't do that, of course. But I accept that there may be something that we don't understand

15:28.400 --> 15:34.480
 about it. So correct me if I'm wrong, but in your book, Selfish Gene, the gene centered view of

15:34.480 --> 15:40.160
 evolution allows us to think of the physical organisms as just the medium through which the

15:40.160 --> 15:49.760
 software of our genetics and the ideas sort of propagate. So maybe can we start just with the

15:49.760 --> 15:57.840
 basics? What in this context does the word meme mean? It would mean the cultural equivalent of a

15:57.840 --> 16:02.960
 gene, cultural equivalent in the sense of that which plays the same role as the gene in the

16:02.960 --> 16:08.720
 transmission of culture and the transmission of ideas in the broadest sense. And it's a

16:08.720 --> 16:13.840
 useful word if there's something Darwinian going on. Obviously, culture is transmitted,

16:14.560 --> 16:18.960
 but is there anything Darwinian going on? And if there is, that means there has to be something

16:18.960 --> 16:25.680
 like a gene, which becomes more numerous or less numerous in the population.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.600
 So it can replicate?

16:27.600 --> 16:31.040
 It can replicate. Well, it clearly does replicate. There's no question about that.

16:31.760 --> 16:36.800
 The question is, does it replicate in a sort of differential way in a Darwinian fashion? Could you

16:36.800 --> 16:43.280
 say that certain ideas propagate because they're successful in the meme pool? In a sort of trivial

16:43.280 --> 16:52.160
 sense, you can. Would you wish to say, though, that in the same way as an animal body is modified,

16:52.160 --> 16:59.200
 adapted to serve as a machine for propagating genes, is it also a machine for propagating memes?

16:59.200 --> 17:05.280
 Could you actually say that something about the way a human is, is modified, adapted,

17:05.280 --> 17:12.480
 is modified, adapted for the function of meme propagation?

17:12.480 --> 17:18.480
 That's such a fascinating possibility, if that's true. That it's not just about the genes which

17:18.480 --> 17:28.240
 seem somehow more comprehensible as these things of biology. The idea that culture or maybe ideas,

17:28.240 --> 17:33.360
 you can really broadly define it, operates under these mechanisms.

17:33.360 --> 17:40.560
 Even morphology, even anatomy does evolve by memetic means. I mean, things like hairstyles,

17:42.720 --> 17:49.840
 styles of makeup, circumcision, these things are actual changes in the body form which are

17:49.840 --> 17:57.760
 nongenetic and which get passed on from generation to generation or sideways like a virus in a

17:57.760 --> 17:59.280
 quasi genetic way.

17:59.280 --> 18:05.520
 But the moment you start drifting away from the physical, it becomes interesting because

18:05.520 --> 18:09.520
 the space of ideas, ideologies, political systems.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.480
 Of course, yes.

18:10.480 --> 18:19.520
 So what's your sense? Are memes a metaphor more or are they really,

18:20.160 --> 18:24.160
 is there something fundamental, almost physical presence of memes?

18:24.160 --> 18:29.440
 Well, I think they're a bit more than a metaphor. And I mentioned the physical

18:30.720 --> 18:35.120
 bodily characteristics which are a bit trivial in a way, but when things like the propagation

18:35.120 --> 18:42.960
 of religious ideas, both longitudinally down generations and transversely as in a sort of

18:42.960 --> 18:54.640
 epidemiology of ideas, when a charismatic preacher converts people, that resembles viral

18:54.640 --> 19:01.360
 transmission. Whereas the longitudinal transmission from grandparent to parent to child,

19:01.360 --> 19:06.320
 et cetera, is more like conventional genetic transmission.

19:06.960 --> 19:12.240
 That's such a beautiful, especially in the modern day idea. Do you think about this

19:12.240 --> 19:17.280
 implication in social networks where the propagation of ideas, the viral propagation of ideas,

19:17.280 --> 19:21.520
 and has the new use of the word meme to describe?

19:21.520 --> 19:27.600
 Well, the internet, of course, provides extremely rapid method of transmission.

19:27.600 --> 19:32.320
 Before, when I first coined the word, the internet didn't exist. And so I was thinking

19:32.320 --> 19:38.960
 that in terms of books, newspapers, broader radio, television, that kind of thing.

19:38.960 --> 19:47.360
 Now an idea can just leap around the world in all directions instantly. And so the internet

19:47.360 --> 19:54.560
 provides a step change in the facility of propagation of memes.

19:54.560 --> 20:00.160
 How does that make you feel? Isn't it fascinating that sort of ideas, it's like you have Galapagos

20:00.160 --> 20:05.760
 Islands or something, it's the 70s, and the internet allowed all these species to just

20:05.760 --> 20:11.760
 like globalize. And in a matter of seconds, you can spread the message to millions of

20:11.760 --> 20:21.360
 people. And these ideas, these memes can breed, can evolve, can mutate. And there's a selection,

20:21.360 --> 20:26.240
 and there's like different, I guess, groups that have all like, there's a dynamics that's

20:26.240 --> 20:31.840
 fascinating here. Do you think, yes, basically, do you think your work in this direction,

20:31.840 --> 20:37.920
 while fundamentally was focused on life on Earth, do you think it should continue, like

20:37.920 --> 20:38.920
 to be taken further?

20:38.920 --> 20:43.200
 Well, I do think it would probably be a good idea to think in a Darwinian way about this

20:43.200 --> 20:49.680
 sort of thing. We conventionally think of the transmission of ideas from an evolutionary

20:49.680 --> 20:58.240
 context as being limited to, in our ancestors, people living in villages, living in small

20:58.240 --> 21:03.120
 bands where everybody knew each other, and ideas could propagate within the village,

21:03.120 --> 21:08.400
 and they might hop to a neighboring village, occasionally, and maybe even to a neighboring

21:08.400 --> 21:15.760
 continent eventually. And that was a slow process. Nowadays, villages are international.

21:15.760 --> 21:22.600
 I mean, you have people, it's been called echo chambers, where people are in a sort

21:22.600 --> 21:28.560
 of internet village, where the other members of the village may be geographically distributed

21:28.560 --> 21:32.080
 all over the world, but they just happen to be interested in the same things, use the

21:32.080 --> 21:38.440
 same terminology, the same jargon, have the same enthusiasm. So, people like the Flat

21:38.440 --> 21:44.080
 Earth Society, they don't all live in one place, they find each other, and they talk

21:44.080 --> 21:48.680
 the same language to each other, they talk the same nonsense to each other. And they,

21:48.680 --> 21:56.040
 so this is a kind of distributed version of the primitive idea of people living in villages

21:56.040 --> 21:58.760
 and propagating their ideas in a local way.

21:58.760 --> 22:06.320
 Is there Darwinist parallel here? So, is there evolutionary purpose of villages, or is that

22:06.320 --> 22:07.320
 just a...

22:07.320 --> 22:12.400
 I wouldn't use a word like evolutionary purpose in that case, but villages will be something

22:12.400 --> 22:16.200
 that just emerged, that's the way people happen to live.

22:16.200 --> 22:23.520
 And in just the same kind of way, the Flat Earth Society, societies of ideas emerge in

22:23.520 --> 22:26.040
 the same kind of way in this digital space.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.040
 Yes, yes.

22:27.040 --> 22:35.160
 Is there something interesting to say about the, I guess, from a perspective of Darwin,

22:35.160 --> 22:43.520
 could we fully interpret the dynamics of social interaction in these social networks? Or is

22:43.520 --> 22:49.360
 there some much more complicated thing need to be developed? Like, what's your sense?

22:49.360 --> 22:55.920
 Well, a Darwinian selection idea would involve investigating which ideas spread and which

22:55.920 --> 23:03.840
 don't. So, some ideas don't have the ability to spread. I mean, the Flat Earth, Flat Earthism

23:03.840 --> 23:07.680
 is, there are a few people believe in it, but it's not going to spread because it's

23:07.680 --> 23:14.600
 obvious nonsense. But other ideas, even if they are wrong, can spread because they are

23:14.600 --> 23:16.600
 attractive in some sense.

23:16.600 --> 23:24.160
 So the spreading and the selection in the Darwinian context is, it just has to be attractive

23:24.160 --> 23:27.840
 in some sense. Like we don't have to define, like it doesn't have to be attractive in the

23:27.840 --> 23:32.520
 way that animals attract each other. It could be attractive in some other way.

23:32.520 --> 23:38.320
 Yes. All that matters is, all that is needed is that it should spread. And it doesn't have

23:38.320 --> 23:43.760
 to be true to spread. In truth, there's one criterion which might help an idea to spread.

23:43.760 --> 23:49.520
 But there are other criteria which might help it to spread. As you say, attraction in animals

23:49.520 --> 23:56.320
 is not necessarily valuable for survival. The famous peacock's tail doesn't help the

23:56.320 --> 24:02.560
 peacock to survive. It helps it to pass on its genes. Similarly, an idea which is actually

24:02.560 --> 24:08.040
 rubbish, but which people don't know is rubbish and think is very attractive will spread in

24:08.040 --> 24:10.360
 the same way as a peacock's gene spread.

24:10.360 --> 24:16.080
 It's a small sidestep. I remember reading somewhere, I think recently, that in some

24:16.080 --> 24:22.840
 species of birds, sort of the idea that beauty may have its own purpose and the idea that

24:22.840 --> 24:31.480
 some birds, I'm being ineloquent here, but there's some aspects of their feathers and

24:31.480 --> 24:37.600
 so on that serve no evolutionary purpose whatsoever. There's somebody making an argument that there

24:37.600 --> 24:44.560
 are some things about beauty that animals do that may be its own purpose. Does that

24:44.560 --> 24:46.880
 ring a bell for you? Does that sound ridiculous?

24:46.880 --> 24:56.640
 I think it's a rather distorted bell. Darwin, when he coined the phrase sexual selection,

24:56.640 --> 25:04.560
 didn't feel the need to suggest that what was attractive to females, usually is males

25:04.560 --> 25:08.720
 attracting females, that what females found attractive had to be useful. He said it didn't

25:08.720 --> 25:13.960
 have to be useful. It was enough that females found it attractive. And so it could be completely

25:13.960 --> 25:18.080
 useless, probably was completely useless in the conventional sense, but was not at all

25:18.080 --> 25:24.000
 useless in the sense of passing on, Darwin didn't call them genes, but in the sense of

25:24.000 --> 25:30.560
 reproducing. Others, starting with Wallace, the co discoverer of natural selection, didn't

25:30.560 --> 25:37.320
 like that idea and they wanted sexually selected characteristics like peacock's tails to be

25:37.320 --> 25:41.920
 in some sense useful. It's a bit of a stretch to think of a peacock's tail as being useful,

25:41.920 --> 25:47.880
 but in the sense of survival, but others have run with that idea and have brought it up

25:47.880 --> 25:53.560
 to date. And so there are two schools of thought on sexual selection, which are still active

25:53.560 --> 25:58.720
 and about equally supported now. Those who follow Darwin in thinking that it's just enough

25:58.720 --> 26:06.120
 to say it's attractive and those who follow Wallace and say that it has to be in some

26:06.120 --> 26:08.440
 sense useful.

26:08.440 --> 26:10.600
 Do you fall into one category or the other?

26:10.600 --> 26:16.400
 No, I'm open minded. I think they both could be correct in different cases. I mean, they've

26:16.400 --> 26:20.760
 both been made sophisticated in a mathematical sense, more so than when Darwin and Wallace

26:20.760 --> 26:22.560
 first started talking about it.

26:22.560 --> 26:30.120
 I'm Russian, I romanticize things, so I prefer the former, where the beauty in itself is

26:30.120 --> 26:40.120
 a powerful attraction, is a powerful force in evolution. On religion, do you think there

26:40.120 --> 26:47.520
 will ever be a time in our future where almost nobody believes in God, or God is not a part

26:47.520 --> 26:49.680
 of the moral fabric of our society?

26:49.680 --> 26:55.200
 Yes, I do. I think it may happen after a very long time. It may take a long time for that

26:55.200 --> 26:56.200
 to happen.

26:56.200 --> 27:03.960
 So do you think ultimately for everybody on Earth, religion, other forms of doctrines,

27:03.960 --> 27:07.880
 ideas could do better job than what religion does?

27:07.880 --> 27:12.480
 Yes. I mean, following in truth, reason.

27:12.480 --> 27:23.520
 Well, truth is a funny, funny word. And reason too. There's, yeah, it's a difficult idea

27:23.520 --> 27:29.960
 now with truth on the internet, right, and fake news and so on. I suppose when you say

27:29.960 --> 27:37.200
 reason, you mean the very basic sort of inarguable conclusions of science versus which political

27:37.200 --> 27:38.200
 system is better.

27:38.200 --> 27:46.680
 Yes, yes. I mean, truth about the real world, which is ascertainable by, not just by the

27:46.680 --> 27:51.320
 more rigorous methods of science, but by just ordinary sensory observation.

27:51.320 --> 27:58.520
 So do you think there will ever be a time when we move past it? Like, I guess another

27:58.520 --> 28:08.760
 way to ask it, are we hopelessly, fundamentally tied to religion in the way our society functions?

28:08.760 --> 28:14.600
 Well, clearly all individuals are not hopelessly tied to it because many individuals don't

28:14.600 --> 28:21.960
 believe. You could mean something like society needs religion in order to function properly,

28:21.960 --> 28:24.160
 something like that. And some people have suggested that.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.120
 What's your intuition on that?

28:26.120 --> 28:33.720
 Well, I've read books on it and they're persuasive. I don't think they're that persuasive though.

28:33.720 --> 28:41.400
 I mean, some people suggested that society needs a sort of figurehead, which can be a

28:41.400 --> 28:45.480
 non existent figurehead in order to function properly. I think there's something rather

28:45.480 --> 28:51.200
 patronising about the idea that, well, you and I are intelligent enough not to believe

28:51.200 --> 28:57.320
 in God, but the plebs need it sort of thing. And I think that's patronising. And I'd like

28:57.320 --> 29:01.400
 to think that that was not the right way to proceed.

29:01.400 --> 29:10.720
 But at the individual level, do you think there's some value of spirituality? Sort of,

29:10.720 --> 29:15.120
 if I think sort of as a scientist, the amount of things we actually know about our universe

29:15.120 --> 29:21.600
 is a tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of what we could possibly know. So just from everything,

29:21.600 --> 29:25.680
 even the certainty we have about the laws of physics, it seems to be that there's yet

29:25.680 --> 29:32.240
 a huge amount to discover. And therefore we're sitting where 99.99% of things are just still

29:32.240 --> 29:38.120
 shrouded in mystery. Do you think there's a role in a kind of spiritual view of that,

29:38.120 --> 29:39.720
 sort of a humbled spiritual view?

29:39.720 --> 29:43.960
 I think it's right to be humble. I think it's right to admit that there's a lot we don't

29:43.960 --> 29:48.480
 know, a lot we don't understand, a lot that we still need to work on. We're working on

29:48.480 --> 29:57.600
 it. What I don't think is that it helps to invoke supernatural explanations. If our current

29:57.600 --> 30:01.640
 scientific explanations aren't adequate to do the job, then we need better ones. We need

30:01.640 --> 30:06.200
 to work more. And of course, the history of science shows just that, that as science goes

30:06.200 --> 30:13.200
 on, problems get solved one after another, and the science advances as science gets better.

30:13.200 --> 30:21.400
 But to invoke a non scientific, non physical explanation is simply to lie down in a cowardly

30:21.400 --> 30:25.440
 way and say, we can't solve it, so we're going to invoke magic. Don't let's do that. Let's

30:25.440 --> 30:30.600
 say we need better science. We need more science. It may be that the science will never do it.

30:30.600 --> 30:36.860
 It may be that we will never actually understand everything. And that's okay, but let's keep

30:36.860 --> 30:39.480
 working on it.

30:39.480 --> 30:43.520
 A challenging question there is, do you think science can lead us astray in terms of the

30:43.520 --> 30:50.680
 humbleness? So there's some aspect of science, maybe it's the aspect of scientists and not

30:50.680 --> 30:59.760
 science, but of sort of a mix of ego and confidence that can lead us astray in terms of discovering

30:59.760 --> 31:05.240
 the, you know, some of the big open questions about the universe.

31:05.240 --> 31:09.640
 I think that's right. I mean, there are, there are arrogant people in any walk of life and

31:09.640 --> 31:13.560
 scientists are no exception to that. And so there are arrogant scientists who think we've

31:13.560 --> 31:18.640
 solved everything. Of course we haven't. So humility is a proper stance for a scientist.

31:18.640 --> 31:25.980
 I mean, it's a proper working stance because it encourages further work. But in a way to

31:25.980 --> 31:30.740
 resort to a supernatural explanation is a kind of arrogance because it's saying, well,

31:30.740 --> 31:38.280
 we don't understand it scientifically. Therefore the non scientific religious supernatural

31:38.280 --> 31:42.200
 explanation must be the right one. That's arrogant. What is, what is humble is to say

31:42.200 --> 31:46.560
 we don't know and we need to work further on it.

31:46.560 --> 31:53.160
 So maybe if I could psychoanalyze you for a second, you have at times been just slightly

31:53.160 --> 32:00.440
 frustrated with people who have supernat, you know, have a supernatural. Has that changed

32:00.440 --> 32:06.480
 over the years? Have you become like, how do people that kind of have a seek supernatural

32:06.480 --> 32:12.720
 explanations, how do you see those people as human beings as it's like, do you see them

32:12.720 --> 32:21.200
 as dishonest? Do you see them as, um, sort of, uh, ignorant? Do you see them as, I don't

32:21.200 --> 32:26.360
 know, is it like, how do you think of certainly not, not, not dishonest. And, and I mean,

32:26.360 --> 32:30.120
 obviously many of them are perfectly nice people. So I don't, I don't sort of despise

32:30.120 --> 32:38.000
 them in that sense. Um, I think it's often a misunderstanding that, that, um, people

32:38.000 --> 32:44.800
 will jump from the admission that we don't understand something. They will jump straight

32:44.800 --> 32:49.440
 to what they think of as an alternative explanation, which is the supernatural one, which is not

32:49.440 --> 32:55.820
 an alternative. It's a non explanation. Um, instead of jumping to the conclusion that

32:55.820 --> 33:02.200
 science needs more work, that we need to actually get, do some better, better science. So, um,

33:02.200 --> 33:09.560
 I don't have, I mean, personal antipathy towards such people. I just think they're, they're

33:09.560 --> 33:10.560
 misguided.

33:10.560 --> 33:15.760
 So what about this really interesting space that I have trouble with? So religion I have

33:15.760 --> 33:21.240
 a better grasp on, but, um, there's a large communities, like you said, Flat Earth community,

33:21.240 --> 33:27.920
 uh, that I've recently, because I've made a few jokes about it. I saw that there's,

33:27.920 --> 33:33.640
 I've noticed that there's people that take it quite seriously. So there's this bigger

33:33.640 --> 33:40.960
 world of conspiracy theorists, which is a kind of, I mean, there's elements of it that

33:40.960 --> 33:48.240
 are religious as well, but I think they're also scientific. So the, the basic credo of

33:48.240 --> 33:56.680
 a conspiracy theorist is to question everything, which is also the credo of a good scientist,

33:56.680 --> 33:59.960
 I would say. So what do you make of this?

33:59.960 --> 34:07.200
 I mean, I think it's probably too easy to say that by labeling something conspiracy,

34:07.200 --> 34:11.840
 you therefore dismiss it. I mean, occasionally conspiracies are right. And so we shouldn't

34:11.840 --> 34:17.440
 dismiss conspiracy theories out of hand. We should examine them on their own merits. Flat

34:17.440 --> 34:22.760
 Earthism is obvious nonsense. We don't have to examine that much further. Um, but, um,

34:22.760 --> 34:27.280
 I mean, there may be other conspiracy theories which are actually right.

34:27.280 --> 34:31.720
 So I've, you know, grew up in the Soviet Union. So I, I just, you know, uh, the space race

34:31.720 --> 34:37.520
 was very influential for me on both sides of the coin. Uh, you know, there's a conspiracy

34:37.520 --> 34:45.200
 theory that we never went to the moon. Right. And it's, uh, it's like, I cannot understand

34:45.200 --> 34:50.760
 it and it's very difficult to rigorously scientifically show one way or the other. It's just, you

34:50.760 --> 34:54.600
 have to use some of the human intuition about who would have to lie, who would have to work

34:54.600 --> 35:01.720
 together. And it's clear that very unlikely, uh, good behind that is my general intuition

35:01.720 --> 35:06.480
 that most people in this world are good. You know, in order to really put together some

35:06.480 --> 35:12.280
 conspiracy theories, there has to be a large number of people working together and essentially

35:12.280 --> 35:13.280
 being dishonest.

35:13.280 --> 35:18.480
 Yes, which is improbable. The sheer number who would have to be in on this conspiracy

35:18.480 --> 35:23.840
 and the sheer detail, the attention to detail they'd have had to have had and so on. I'd

35:23.840 --> 35:29.400
 also worry about the motive and why would anyone want to suggest that it didn't happen?

35:29.400 --> 35:35.120
 What's the, what's the, why is it so hard to believe? I mean, the, the physics of it,

35:35.120 --> 35:40.720
 the mathematics of it, the, the idea of computing orbits and, and, and trajectories and things,

35:40.720 --> 35:44.360
 it, it all works mathematically. Why wouldn't you believe it?

35:44.360 --> 35:50.280
 It's a psychology question because there's something really pleasant about, um, you know,

35:50.280 --> 35:55.700
 pointing out that the emperor has no clothes when everybody like, uh, you know, thinking

35:55.700 --> 36:00.240
 outside the box and coming up with the true answer where everybody else is diluted. There's

36:00.240 --> 36:04.480
 something, I mean, I have that for science, right? You want to prove the entire scientific

36:04.480 --> 36:06.120
 community wrong. That's the whole.

36:06.120 --> 36:11.040
 That's, that's, that's right. And, and of course, historically, lone geniuses have come

36:11.040 --> 36:15.820
 out right sometimes, but often people with who think they're a lone genius much more

36:15.820 --> 36:20.840
 often turn out not to. Um, so you have to judge each case on its merits. The mere fact

36:20.840 --> 36:25.960
 that you're a maverick, the mere fact that you, you're going against the current tide

36:25.960 --> 36:29.960
 doesn't make you right. You've got to show you're right by looking at the evidence.

36:29.960 --> 36:35.480
 So because you focus so much on, on religion and disassembled a lot of ideas there and

36:35.480 --> 36:41.400
 I just, I was wondering if, if you have ideas about conspiracy theory groups, because it's

36:41.400 --> 36:46.600
 such a prevalent, even reaching into, uh, presidential politics and so on. It seems

36:46.600 --> 36:50.960
 like it's a very large communities that believe different kinds of conspiracy theories. Is

36:50.960 --> 36:56.560
 there some connection there to your thinking on religion? And it is curious. It's a matter.

36:56.560 --> 37:03.000
 It's an obvious difficult thing. Uh, I don't understand why people believe things that

37:03.000 --> 37:07.960
 are clearly nonsense, like, well, flat earth and also the conspiracy about not landing

37:07.960 --> 37:15.000
 on the moon or, um, that, um, the, that the United States engineered 9 11 that, that kind

37:15.000 --> 37:21.640
 of thing. Um, so it's not clearly nonsense. It's extremely unlikely. Okay. It's extremely

37:21.640 --> 37:27.020
 unlikely that religion is a bit different because it's passed down from generation to

37:27.020 --> 37:31.920
 generation. So many of the people who are religious, uh, got it from their parents who

37:31.920 --> 37:35.800
 got it from their parents who got it from their parents and childhood indoctrination

37:35.800 --> 37:45.840
 is a very powerful force. But these things like the nine 11 conspiracy theory, the, um,

37:45.840 --> 37:50.840
 Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory, the man on the moon conspiracy theory, these are

37:50.840 --> 37:57.120
 not childhood indoctrination. These are, um, presumably dreamed up by somebody who then

37:57.120 --> 38:04.600
 tells somebody else who then wants to believe it. And I don't know why people are so eager

38:04.600 --> 38:10.760
 to fall in line with some, just some person that they happen to read or meet who spins

38:10.760 --> 38:16.160
 some yarn. I can kind of understand why they believe what their parents and teachers told

38:16.160 --> 38:21.600
 them when they were very tiny and not capable of critical thinking for themselves. So I

38:21.600 --> 38:28.960
 sort of get why the great religions of the world like Catholicism and Islam go on persisting.

38:28.960 --> 38:34.080
 It's because of childhood indoctrination, but that's not true of flat earthism and sure

38:34.080 --> 38:40.440
 enough flat earthism is a very minority cult way larger than I ever realized. Well, yes,

38:40.440 --> 38:43.880
 I know, but so that's a really clean idea and you've articulated that in your new book

38:43.880 --> 38:49.280
 and then, and I'll go on God and in God, the illusion is the early indoctrination. That's

38:49.280 --> 38:54.320
 really interesting that you can get away with a lot of out there ideas in terms of religious

38:54.320 --> 39:04.140
 texts. If, um, the age at which you convey those ideas at first is a young age. So indoctrination

39:04.140 --> 39:11.600
 is sort of an essential element of propagation of religion. So let me ask on the morality

39:11.600 --> 39:16.360
 side in the books that I mentioned, God, delusion, and I'll go on God. You described that human

39:16.360 --> 39:21.960
 beings don't need religion to be moral. So from an engineering perspective, we want to

39:21.960 --> 39:32.800
 engineer morality into AI systems. So in general, where do you think morals come from in humans?

39:32.800 --> 39:40.680
 A very complicated and interesting question. It's clear to me that the moral standards,

39:40.680 --> 39:50.560
 the moral values of our civilization changes as the decades go by, certainly as the centuries

39:50.560 --> 39:59.400
 go by, even as the decades go by. And we in the 21st century are quite clearly labeled

39:59.400 --> 40:05.680
 21st century people in terms of our moral values. There's a spread. I mean, some of

40:05.680 --> 40:10.600
 us are a little bit more ruthless, some of us more conservative, some of us more liberal

40:10.600 --> 40:18.040
 and so on. But we all subscribe to pretty much the same views when you compare us with

40:18.040 --> 40:26.720
 say 18th century, 17th century people, even 19th century, 20th century people. So we're

40:26.720 --> 40:31.440
 much less racist, we're much less sexist and so on than we used to be. Some people are

40:31.440 --> 40:37.080
 still racist and some are still sexist, but the spread has shifted. The Gaussian distribution

40:37.080 --> 40:47.300
 has moved and moves steadily as the centuries go by. And that is the most powerful influence

40:47.300 --> 40:54.360
 I can see on our moral values. And that doesn't have anything to do with religion. I mean,

40:54.360 --> 41:03.520
 the religion, sorry, the morals of the Old Testament are Bronze Age models. They're deplorable

41:03.520 --> 41:09.560
 and they are to be understood in terms of the people in the desert who made them up

41:09.560 --> 41:17.800
 at the time. And so human sacrifice, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, petty revenge,

41:17.800 --> 41:23.800
 killing people for breaking the Sabbath, all that kind of thing, inconceivable now.

41:23.800 --> 41:29.380
 So at some point religious texts may have in part reflected that Gaussian distribution

41:29.380 --> 41:30.380
 at that time.

41:30.380 --> 41:32.220
 I'm sure they did. I'm sure they always reflect that, yes.

41:32.220 --> 41:39.040
 And then now, but the sort of almost like the meme, as you describe it, of ideas moves

41:39.040 --> 41:42.120
 much faster than religious texts do, than new religions.

41:42.120 --> 41:49.200
 Yes. So basing your morals on religious texts, which were written millennia ago, is not a

41:49.200 --> 41:56.920
 great way to proceed. I think that's pretty clear. So not only should we not get our morals

41:56.920 --> 42:03.640
 from such texts, but we don't. We quite clearly don't. If we did, then we'd be discriminating

42:03.640 --> 42:12.960
 against women and we'd be racist, we'd be killing homosexuals and so on. So we don't

42:12.960 --> 42:20.400
 and we shouldn't. Now, of course, it's possible to use your 21st century standards of morality

42:20.400 --> 42:25.980
 and you can look at the Bible and you can cherry pick particular verses which conform

42:25.980 --> 42:30.640
 to our modern morality, and you'll find that Jesus says some pretty nice things, which

42:30.640 --> 42:38.120
 is great. But you're using your 21st century morality to decide which verses to pick, which

42:38.120 --> 42:44.480
 verses to reject. And so why not cut out the middleman of the Bible and go straight to

42:44.480 --> 42:51.080
 the 21st century morality, which is where that comes from. It's a much more complicated

42:51.080 --> 42:57.400
 question. Why is it that morality, moral values change as the centuries go by? They undoubtedly

42:57.400 --> 43:02.680
 do. And it's a very interesting question to ask why. It's another example of cultural

43:02.680 --> 43:09.640
 evolution, just as technology progresses, so moral values progress for probably very

43:09.640 --> 43:10.640
 different reasons.

43:10.640 --> 43:15.440
 But it's interesting if the direction in which that progress is happening has some evolutionary

43:15.440 --> 43:18.960
 value or if it's merely a drift that can go into any direction.

43:18.960 --> 43:22.880
 I'm not sure it's any direction and I'm not sure it's evolutionarily valuable. What it

43:22.880 --> 43:29.320
 is is progressive in the sense that each step is a step in the same direction as the previous

43:29.320 --> 43:37.080
 step. So it becomes more gentle, more decent by modern standards, more liberal, less violent.

43:37.080 --> 43:42.600
 But more decent, I think you're using terms and interpreting everything in the context

43:42.600 --> 43:48.320
 of the 21st century because Genghis Khan would probably say that this is not more decent

43:48.320 --> 43:52.560
 because we're now, you know, there's a lot of weak members of society that we're not

43:52.560 --> 43:53.560
 murdering.

43:53.560 --> 43:58.240
 Yes. I was careful to say by the standards of the 21st century, by our standards, if

43:58.240 --> 44:03.160
 we with hindsight look back at history, what we see is a trend in the direction towards

44:03.160 --> 44:06.840
 us, towards our present, our present value system.

44:06.840 --> 44:13.360
 For us, we see progress, but it's an open question whether that won't, you know, I don't

44:13.360 --> 44:17.040
 see necessarily why we can never return to Genghis Khan times.

44:17.040 --> 44:26.160
 We could. I suspect we won't. But if you look at the history of moral values over the centuries,

44:26.160 --> 44:31.640
 it is in a progressive, I use the word progressive not in a value judgment sense, in the sense

44:31.640 --> 44:37.640
 of a transitive sense. Each step is the same, is the same direction as the previous step.

44:37.640 --> 44:47.600
 So things like we don't derive entertainment from torturing cats. We don't derive entertainment

44:47.600 --> 44:53.360
 from like the Romans did in the Colosseum from that state.

44:53.360 --> 45:00.440
 Or rather we suppress the desire to get, I mean, to have play. It's probably in us somewhere.

45:00.440 --> 45:05.320
 So there's a bunch of parts of our brain, one that probably, you know, limbic system

45:05.320 --> 45:10.980
 that wants certain pleasures. And that's I don't, I mean, I wouldn't have said that,

45:10.980 --> 45:16.200
 but you're at liberty to think that you like, well, no, there's a, there's a Dan Carlin

45:16.200 --> 45:20.560
 of hardcore history. There's a really nice explanation of how we've enjoyed watching

45:20.560 --> 45:25.040
 the torture of people, the fighting of people, just to torture the suffering of people throughout

45:25.040 --> 45:32.560
 history as entertainment until quite recently. And now everything we do with sports, we're

45:32.560 --> 45:38.160
 kind of channeling that feeling into something else. I mean, there, there is some dark aspects

45:38.160 --> 45:44.400
 of human nature that are underneath everything. And I do hope this like higher level software

45:44.400 --> 45:52.440
 we've built will keep us at bay. I'm also Jewish and have history with the Soviet Union

45:52.440 --> 45:58.400
 and the Holocaust. And I clearly remember that some of the darker aspects of human nature

45:58.400 --> 45:59.400
 creeped up there.

45:59.400 --> 46:04.120
 They do. There have been, there have been steps backwards admittedly, and the Holocaust

46:04.120 --> 46:11.000
 is an obvious one. But if you take a broad view of history, it's the same direction.

46:11.000 --> 46:16.960
 So Pamela McCordick in Machines Who Think has written that AI began with an ancient

46:16.960 --> 46:24.120
 wish to forge the gods. Do you see, it's a poetic description I suppose, but do you see

46:24.120 --> 46:30.120
 a connection between our civilizations, historic desire to create gods, to create religions

46:30.120 --> 46:35.560
 and our modern desire to create technology and intelligent technology?

46:35.560 --> 46:46.440
 I suppose there's a link between an ancient desire to explain away mystery and science,

46:46.440 --> 46:53.920
 but intelligence, artificial intelligence, creating gods, creating new gods. And I forget,

46:53.920 --> 46:59.320
 I read somewhere a somewhat facetious paper which said that we have a new god is called

46:59.320 --> 47:05.320
 Google and we pray to it and we worship it and we ask its advice like an Oracle and so

47:05.320 --> 47:08.680
 on. That's fun.

47:08.680 --> 47:12.200
 You don't see that, you see that as a fun statement, a facetious statement. You don't

47:12.200 --> 47:17.480
 see that as a kind of truth of us creating things that are more powerful than ourselves

47:17.480 --> 47:18.480
 and natural.

47:18.480 --> 47:26.440
 It has a kind of poetic resonance to it, which I get, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't have bothered

47:26.440 --> 47:28.840
 to make the point myself, put it that way.

47:28.840 --> 47:34.320
 All right. So you don't think AI will become our new god, a new religion, a new gods like

47:34.320 --> 47:35.320
 Google?

47:35.320 --> 47:42.280
 Well, yes. I mean, I can see that the future of intelligent machines or indeed intelligent

47:42.280 --> 47:48.800
 aliens from outer space might yield beings that we would regard as gods in the sense

47:48.800 --> 47:55.200
 that they are so superior to us that we might as well worship them. That's highly plausible,

47:55.200 --> 48:03.460
 I think. But I see a very fundamental distinction between a god who is simply defined as something

48:03.460 --> 48:09.400
 very, very powerful and intelligent on the one hand and a god who doesn't need explaining

48:09.400 --> 48:20.360
 by a progressive step by step process like evolution or like engineering design. So suppose

48:20.360 --> 48:27.080
 we did meet an alien from outer space who was marvelously, magnificently more intelligent

48:27.080 --> 48:31.800
 than us and we would sort of worship it for that reason. Nevertheless, it would not be

48:31.800 --> 48:39.640
 a god in the very important sense that it did not just happen to be there like god is

48:39.640 --> 48:46.480
 supposed to. It must have come about by a gradual step by step incremental progressive

48:46.480 --> 48:52.900
 process, presumably like Darwinian evolution. There's all the difference in the world between

48:52.900 --> 49:01.180
 those two. Intelligence, design comes into the universe late as a product of a progressive

49:01.180 --> 49:06.560
 evolutionary process or progressive engineering design process.

49:06.560 --> 49:11.280
 So most of the work is done through this slow moving progress.

49:11.280 --> 49:12.280
 Exactly.

49:12.280 --> 49:23.240
 Yeah. Yeah. But there's still this desire to get answers to the why question that if

49:23.240 --> 49:27.600
 the world is a simulation, if we're living in a simulation, that there's a programmer

49:27.600 --> 49:30.400
 like creature that we can ask questions of.

49:30.400 --> 49:35.600
 Well, let's pursue the idea that we're living in a simulation, which is not totally ridiculous,

49:35.600 --> 49:36.600
 by the way.

49:36.600 --> 49:39.720
 There we go.

49:39.720 --> 49:46.440
 Then you still need to explain the programmer. The programmer had to come into existence

49:46.440 --> 49:53.440
 by some... Even if we're in a simulation, the programmer must have evolved. Or if he's

49:53.440 --> 49:54.920
 in a sort of...

49:54.920 --> 49:55.920
 Or she.

49:55.920 --> 50:03.600
 If she's in a meta simulation, then the meta program must have evolved by a gradual process.

50:03.600 --> 50:09.880
 You can't escape that. Fundamentally, you've got to come back to a gradual incremental

50:09.880 --> 50:13.760
 process of explanation to start with.

50:13.760 --> 50:15.640
 There's no shortcuts in this world.

50:15.640 --> 50:17.640
 No, exactly.

50:17.640 --> 50:22.200
 But maybe to linger on that point about the simulation, do you think it's an interesting

50:22.200 --> 50:28.400
 thing? Basically, you talk to... Bored the heck out of everybody asking this question,

50:28.400 --> 50:33.440
 but whether you live in a simulation, do you think... First, do you think we live in a

50:33.440 --> 50:37.480
 simulation? Second, do you think it's an interesting thought experiment?

50:37.480 --> 50:42.160
 It's certainly an interesting thought experiment. I first met it in a science fiction novel

50:42.160 --> 50:53.720
 by Daniel Galloy called Counterfeit World, in which it's all about... I mean, our heroes

50:53.720 --> 51:00.520
 are running a gigantic computer which simulates the world, and something goes wrong, and so

51:00.520 --> 51:05.840
 one of them has to go down into the simulated world in order to fix it. And then the denouement

51:05.840 --> 51:10.040
 of the thing, the climax to the novel, is that they discover that they themselves are

51:10.040 --> 51:15.580
 in another simulation at a higher level. So I was intrigued by this, and I love others

51:15.580 --> 51:23.840
 of Daniel Galloy's science fiction novels. Then it was revived seriously by Nick Bostrom...

51:23.840 --> 51:27.600
 Bostrom talking to him in an hour.

51:27.600 --> 51:32.520
 And he goes further, not just treat it as a science fiction speculation, he actually

51:32.520 --> 51:37.800
 thinks it's positively likely. I mean, he thinks it's very likely, actually.

51:37.800 --> 51:42.480
 He makes a probabilistic argument, which you can use to come up with very interesting conclusions

51:42.480 --> 51:44.360
 about the nature of this universe.

51:44.360 --> 51:50.880
 I mean, he thinks that we're in a simulation done by, so to speak, our descendants of the

51:50.880 --> 51:56.200
 future. But it's still a product of evolution. It's still ultimately going to be a product

51:56.200 --> 52:05.040
 of evolution, even though the super intelligent people of the future have created our world,

52:05.040 --> 52:11.800
 and you and I are just a simulation, and this table is a simulation and so on. I don't actually

52:11.800 --> 52:15.160
 in my heart of hearts believe it, but I like his argument.

52:15.160 --> 52:21.200
 Well, so the interesting thing is that I agree with you, but the interesting thing to me,

52:21.200 --> 52:26.720
 if I were to say, if we're living in a simulation, that in that simulation, to make it work,

52:26.720 --> 52:31.240
 you still have to do everything gradually, just like you said. That even though it's

52:31.240 --> 52:33.360
 programmed, I don't think there could be miracles.

52:33.360 --> 52:39.840
 Well, no, I mean, the programmer, the higher, the upper ones have to have evolved gradually.

52:39.840 --> 52:44.080
 However, the simulation they create could be instantaneous. I mean, they could be switched

52:44.080 --> 52:47.840
 on and we come into the world with fabricated memories.

52:47.840 --> 52:53.840
 True, but what I'm trying to convey, so you're saying the broader statement, but I'm saying

52:53.840 --> 52:59.240
 from an engineering perspective, both the programmer has to be slowly evolved and the

52:59.240 --> 53:03.160
 simulation because it's like, from an engineering perspective.

53:03.160 --> 53:05.640
 Oh yeah, it takes a long time to write a program.

53:05.640 --> 53:11.000
 No, like just, I don't think you can create the universe in a snap. I think you have to

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
 grow it.

53:12.000 --> 53:20.600
 Okay. Well, that's a good point. That's an arguable point. By the way, I have thought

53:20.600 --> 53:26.720
 about using the Nick Bostrom idea to solve the riddle of how you were talking. We were

53:26.720 --> 53:33.360
 talking earlier about why the human brain can achieve so much. I thought of this when

53:33.360 --> 53:39.880
 my then 100 year old mother was marveling at what I could do with a smartphone and I

53:39.880 --> 53:44.440
 could call, look up anything in the encyclopedia, I could play her music that she liked and

53:44.440 --> 53:48.560
 so on. She said, but it's all in that tiny little phone. No, it's out there. It's in

53:48.560 --> 53:56.440
 the cloud. And maybe most of what we do is in a cloud. So maybe if we are a simulation,

53:56.440 --> 54:01.880
 even all the power that we think is in our skull, it actually may be like the power that

54:01.880 --> 54:07.880
 we think is in the iPhone. But is that actually out there in an interface to something else?

54:07.880 --> 54:14.200
 I mean, that's what, including Roger Penrose with panpsychism, that consciousness is somehow

54:14.200 --> 54:19.640
 a fundamental part of physics, that it doesn't have to actually all reside inside. But Roger

54:19.640 --> 54:26.520
 thinks it does reside in the skull, whereas I'm suggesting that it doesn't, that there's

54:26.520 --> 54:27.520
 a cloud.

54:27.520 --> 54:35.520
 That'd be a fascinating notion. On a small tangent, are you familiar with the work of

54:35.520 --> 54:43.640
 Donald Hoffman, I guess? Maybe not saying his name correctly, but just forget the name,

54:43.640 --> 54:51.040
 the idea that there's a difference between reality and perception. So like we biological

54:51.040 --> 54:55.120
 organisms perceive the world in order for the natural selection process to be able to

54:55.120 --> 55:01.120
 survive and so on. But that doesn't mean that our perception actually reflects the fundamental

55:01.120 --> 55:03.920
 reality, the physical reality underneath.

55:03.920 --> 55:10.600
 Well, I do think that although it reflects the fundamental reality, I do believe there

55:10.600 --> 55:18.520
 is a fundamental reality, I do think that our perception is constructive in the sense

55:18.520 --> 55:26.280
 that we construct in our minds a model of what we're seeing. And so this is really the

55:26.280 --> 55:32.400
 view of people who work on visual illusions, like Richard Gregory, who point out that things

55:32.400 --> 55:40.680
 like a Necker cube, which flip from a two dimensional picture of a cube on a sheet of

55:40.680 --> 55:46.520
 paper, we see it as a three dimensional cube, and it flips from one orientation to another

55:46.520 --> 55:53.160
 at regular intervals. What's going on is that the brain is constructing a cube, but the

55:53.160 --> 55:58.320
 sense data are compatible with two alternative cubes. And so rather than stick with one of

55:58.320 --> 56:04.120
 them, it alternates between them. I think that's just a model for what we do all the

56:04.120 --> 56:10.520
 time when we see a table, when we see a person, when we see anything, we're using the sense

56:10.520 --> 56:18.160
 data to construct or make use of a perhaps previously constructed model. I noticed this

56:18.160 --> 56:26.680
 when I meet somebody who actually is, say, a friend of mine, but until I kind of realized

56:26.680 --> 56:33.520
 that it is him, he looks different. And then when I finally clock that it's him, his features

56:33.520 --> 56:39.720
 switch like a Necker cube into the familiar form. As it were, I've taken his face out

56:39.720 --> 56:48.240
 of the filing cabinet inside and grafted it onto or used the sense data to invoke it.

56:48.240 --> 56:53.200
 Yeah, we do some kind of miraculous compression on this whole thing to be able to filter out

56:53.200 --> 56:58.840
 most of the sense data and make sense of it. That's just a magical thing that we do. So

56:58.840 --> 57:08.360
 you've written several, many amazing books, but let me ask, what books, technical or fiction

57:08.360 --> 57:15.920
 or philosophical, had a big impact on your own life? What books would you recommend people

57:15.920 --> 57:19.280
 consider reading in their own intellectual journey?

57:19.280 --> 57:29.000
 Darwin, of course. The original. I'm actually ashamed to say I've never read Darwin. He's

57:29.000 --> 57:35.880
 astonishingly prescient because considering he was writing in the middle of the 19th century,

57:35.880 --> 57:41.000
 Michael Gieselin said he's working 100 years ahead of his time. Everything except genetics

57:41.000 --> 57:49.240
 is amazingly right and amazingly far ahead of his time. And of course, you need to read

57:49.240 --> 57:55.880
 the updatings that have happened since his time as well. I mean, he would be astonished

57:55.880 --> 58:03.380
 by, well, let alone Watson and Crick, of course, but he'd be astonished by Mendelian genetics

58:03.380 --> 58:04.380
 as well.

58:04.380 --> 58:08.480
 Yeah, it'd be fascinating to see what he thought about DNA, what he would think about DNA.

58:08.480 --> 58:15.280
 I mean, yes, it would. Because in many ways, it clears up what appeared in his time to

58:15.280 --> 58:23.600
 be a riddle. The digital nature of genetics clears up what was a problem, what was a big

58:23.600 --> 58:28.680
 problem. Gosh, there's so much that I could think of. I can't really...

58:28.680 --> 58:34.880
 Is there something outside sort of more fiction? When you think young, was there books that

58:34.880 --> 58:39.840
 just kind of outside of kind of the realm of science or religion that just kind of sparked

58:39.840 --> 58:40.840
 your journey?

58:40.840 --> 58:47.520
 Yes. Well, actually, I suppose I could say that I've learned some science from science

58:47.520 --> 58:57.360
 fiction. I mentioned Daniel Galloy, and that's one example, but another of his novels called

58:57.360 --> 59:01.800
 Dark Universe, which is not terribly well known, but it's a very, very nice science

59:01.800 --> 59:07.880
 fiction story. It's about a world of perpetual darkness. And we're not told at the beginning

59:07.880 --> 59:12.840
 of the book why these people are in darkness. They stumble around in some kind of underground

59:12.840 --> 59:21.280
 world of caverns and passages, using echolocation like bats and whales to get around. And they've

59:21.280 --> 59:28.600
 adapted, presumably by Darwinian means, to survive in perpetual total darkness. But what's

59:28.600 --> 59:36.480
 interesting is that their mythology, their religion has echoes of Christianity, but it's

59:36.480 --> 59:44.720
 based on light. And so there's been a fall from a paradise world that once existed where

59:44.720 --> 59:52.880
 light reigns supreme. And because of the sin of mankind, light banished them. So they no

59:52.880 --> 59:58.640
 longer are in light's presence, but light survives in the form of mythology and in the

59:58.640 --> 1:00:04.740
 form of sayings like, there's a great light almighty. Oh, for light's sake, don't do that.

1:00:04.740 --> 1:00:08.000
 And I hear what you mean rather than I see what you mean.

1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:12.000
 So some of the same religious elements are present in this other totally kind of absurd

1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:13.000
 different form.

1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:17.640
 Yes. And so it's a wonderful, I wouldn't call it satire, because it's too good natured

1:00:17.640 --> 1:00:24.640
 for that. I mean, a wonderful parable about Christianity and the doctrine, the theological

1:00:24.640 --> 1:00:31.640
 doctrine of the fall. So I find that kind of science fiction immensely stimulating.

1:00:31.640 --> 1:00:36.360
 Fred Hoyle's The Black Cloud. Oh, by the way, anything by Arthur C. Clarke I find very wonderful

1:00:36.360 --> 1:00:46.520
 too. Fred Hoyle's The Black Cloud, his first science fiction novel, where he, well, I learned

1:00:46.520 --> 1:00:52.240
 a lot of science from that. It suffers from an obnoxious hero, unfortunately, but apart

1:00:52.240 --> 1:00:59.520
 from that, you learn a lot of science from it. Another of his novels, A for Andromeda,

1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:05.920
 which by the way, the theme of that is taken up by Carl Sagan's science fiction novel,

1:01:05.920 --> 1:01:15.400
 another wonderful writer, Carl Sagan, Contact, where the idea is, again, we will not be visited

1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:21.040
 from outer space by physical bodies. We will be visited possibly, we might be visited by

1:01:21.040 --> 1:01:28.840
 radio, but the radio signals could manipulate us and actually have a concrete influence

1:01:28.840 --> 1:01:37.040
 on the world if they make us or persuade us to build a computer, which runs their software.

1:01:37.040 --> 1:01:43.560
 So that they can then transmit their software by radio, and then the computer takes over

1:01:43.560 --> 1:01:50.240
 the world. And this is the same theme in both Hoyle's book and Sagan's book, I presume.

1:01:50.240 --> 1:01:56.440
 I don't know whether Sagan knew about Hoyle's book, probably did. But it's a clever idea

1:01:56.440 --> 1:02:04.600
 that we will never be invaded by physical bodies. The War of the Worlds of H.G. Wells

1:02:04.600 --> 1:02:11.880
 will never happen. But we could be invaded by radio signals, code, coded information,

1:02:11.880 --> 1:02:20.520
 which is sort of like DNA. And we are, I call them, we are survival machines of our DNA.

1:02:20.520 --> 1:02:26.520
 So it has great resonance for me, because I think of us, I think of bodies, physical

1:02:26.520 --> 1:02:34.640
 bodies, biological bodies, as being manipulated by coded information, DNA, which has come

1:02:34.640 --> 1:02:35.640
 down through generations.

1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:40.840
 And in the space of memes, it doesn't have to be physical, it can be transmitted through

1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:47.440
 the space of information. That's a fascinating possibility, that from outer space we can

1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:54.160
 be infiltrated by other memes, by other ideas, and thereby controlled in that way. Let me

1:02:54.160 --> 1:03:00.160
 ask the last, the silliest, or maybe the most important question. What is the meaning of

1:03:00.160 --> 1:03:06.200
 life? What gives your life fulfillment, purpose, happiness, meaning?

1:03:06.200 --> 1:03:10.360
 From a scientific point of view, the meaning of life is the propagation of DNA, but that's

1:03:10.360 --> 1:03:16.280
 not what I feel. That's not the meaning of my life. So the meaning of my life is something

1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:19.700
 which is probably different from yours and different from other people's, but we each

1:03:19.700 --> 1:03:27.060
 make our own meaning. So we set up goals, we want to achieve, we want to write a book,

1:03:27.060 --> 1:03:36.000
 we want to do whatever it is we do, write a quartet, we want to win a football match.

1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:41.680
 And these are short term goals, well, maybe even quite long term goals, which are set

1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:46.840
 up by our brains, which have goal seeking machinery built into them. But what we feel,

1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:54.680
 we don't feel motivated by the desire to pass on our DNA, mostly. We have other goals which

1:03:54.680 --> 1:04:01.440
 can be very moving, very important. They could even be called as called spiritual in some

1:04:01.440 --> 1:04:07.640
 cases. We want to understand the riddle of the universe, we want to understand consciousness,

1:04:07.640 --> 1:04:13.840
 we want to understand how the brain works. These are all noble goals. Some of them can

1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:20.080
 be noble goals anyway. And they are a far cry from the fundamental biological goal,

1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:26.940
 which is the propagation of DNA. But the machinery that enables us to set up these higher level

1:04:26.940 --> 1:04:34.240
 goals is originally programmed into us by natural selection of DNA.

1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:41.720
 The propagation of DNA. But what do you make of this unfortunate fact that we are mortal?

1:04:41.720 --> 1:04:47.080
 Do you ponder your mortality? Does it make you sad?

1:04:47.080 --> 1:04:53.880
 I ponder it. It would, it makes me sad that I shall have to leave and not see what's going

1:04:53.880 --> 1:05:02.200
 to happen next. If there's something frightening about mortality, apart from sort of missing,

1:05:02.200 --> 1:05:10.320
 as I said, something more deeply, darkly frightening, it's the idea of eternity. But eternity is

1:05:10.320 --> 1:05:15.280
 only frightening if you're there. Eternity before we were born, billions of years before

1:05:15.280 --> 1:05:20.680
 we were born, and we were effectively dead before we were born. As I think it was Mark

1:05:20.680 --> 1:05:25.240
 Twain said, I was dead for billions of years before I was born and never suffered the smallest

1:05:25.240 --> 1:05:31.920
 inconvenience. That's how it's going to be after we leave. So I think of it as really,

1:05:31.920 --> 1:05:36.720
 mortality is a frightening prospect. And so the best way to spend it is under a general

1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:39.680
 anesthetic, which is what it'll be.

1:05:39.680 --> 1:05:44.280
 Beautifully put. Richard, it is a huge honor to meet you, to talk to you. Thank you so

1:05:44.280 --> 1:05:45.280
 much for your time.

1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:46.280
 Thank you very much.

1:05:46.280 --> 1:05:50.880

1:06:08.640 --> 1:06:13.080
 And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom from Richard Dawkins.

1:06:13.080 --> 1:06:18.880
 We are going to die. And that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to

1:06:18.880 --> 1:06:24.120
 die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here

1:06:24.120 --> 1:06:29.460
 in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains

1:06:29.460 --> 1:06:36.320
 of Arabia. Certainly, those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists

1:06:36.320 --> 1:06:42.000
 greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our

1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:49.560
 DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds,

1:06:49.560 --> 1:06:57.440
 it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here. We privileged few who won the lottery

1:06:57.440 --> 1:07:04.840
 of birth against all odds. How dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state

1:07:04.840 --> 1:07:08.480
 from which the vast majority have never stirred.

1:07:08.480 --> 1:07:28.000
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
