00:00.000 --> 00:03.140
 The following is a conversation with Zev Weinstein,

00:03.140 --> 00:06.380
 a young man with a brilliant, bold and hopeful mind

00:06.380 --> 00:08.980
 that I had the great fortune of talking to

00:08.980 --> 00:10.600
 on a recent afternoon.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.700
 He happens to be Eric Weinstein's son,

00:13.700 --> 00:15.780
 but I invited Zev not because of that,

00:15.780 --> 00:17.780
 but because I got a chance to listen to him speak

00:17.780 --> 00:20.540
 on a few occasions and was captivated

00:20.540 --> 00:22.900
 by how deeply he thought about this world

00:22.900 --> 00:24.340
 at such a young age.

00:24.340 --> 00:25.960
 And I thought that it might be fun

00:25.960 --> 00:29.160
 to explore this world of ours together with him

00:29.160 --> 00:31.820
 for a time through this conversation.

00:31.820 --> 00:33.500
 Quick mention of our sponsors.

00:33.500 --> 00:37.160
 ExpressVPN, Grammarly Grammar Assistant,

00:37.160 --> 00:39.020
 Simply Safe Home Security,

00:39.020 --> 00:41.820
 and Magic Spoon Low Carb Cereal.

00:41.820 --> 00:46.180
 So the choice is privacy, grammar, safety or health.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.580
 Choose wisely, my friends.

00:52.940 --> 00:56.460
 As a side note, let me say that Zev acknowledges

00:56.460 --> 00:59.980
 the fear associated with participating in public discourse

00:59.980 --> 01:03.140
 and is brave enough to join in at a young age,

01:03.140 --> 01:05.820
 to push forward, to change his mind publicly,

01:05.820 --> 01:09.300
 to learn, to articulate difficult nuanced ideas

01:09.300 --> 01:11.900
 and grow from the conversations that follow.

01:11.900 --> 01:15.100
 In this, I hope he leads the next generation of minds

01:15.100 --> 01:18.100
 that is joining and steering the collective intelligence

01:18.100 --> 01:21.100
 of this big ant colony we think of

01:21.100 --> 01:23.460
 as our human civilization.

 And now, here's my conversation with Zev Weinstein.

01:38.900 --> 01:42.180
 You've said that philosophy becomes more dangerous

01:42.180 --> 01:43.540
 in difficult times.

01:43.540 --> 01:44.740
 What do you mean by that?

01:44.740 --> 01:48.460
 Interestingly, I think I mean two things by that.

01:48.460 --> 01:51.420
 And I think firstly, I should clarify,

01:51.420 --> 01:53.600
 when I say philosophy, I sort of mean

01:53.600 --> 01:58.600
 in a very traditional sense, just thinking, ideation.

01:58.740 --> 02:03.200
 And that could be reconsidering our notions of self

02:03.200 --> 02:06.620
 in a very traditional sense, which we consider philosophy,

02:06.620 --> 02:10.740
 or that could be like technological innovation.

02:10.740 --> 02:13.100
 I think it's important to recognize all of these

02:13.100 --> 02:16.540
 as philosophies that we can not question

02:16.540 --> 02:18.840
 whether it's important to promote thought.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.100
 I think the other thing I should clarify

02:21.100 --> 02:23.180
 is when I say difficult times,

02:23.180 --> 02:25.980
 I mean times when nothing is growing,

02:25.980 --> 02:30.980
 and so the risk for real conflict is much greater

02:31.260 --> 02:34.860
 because people are incentivized to fight over the things

02:34.860 --> 02:37.240
 which already exist.

02:37.240 --> 02:41.060
 I think when times are not difficult,

02:41.900 --> 02:44.540
 the people with the greatest power

02:44.540 --> 02:47.620
 are usually the people who are very creative,

02:47.620 --> 02:50.820
 generating a lot, and that really requires ideation

02:50.820 --> 02:53.420
 or philosophy of some sort.

02:53.420 --> 02:56.660
 I think when times become stagnant,

02:56.660 --> 03:00.740
 the important successful people become the people

03:00.740 --> 03:04.380
 who are very good at protecting their own pieces of the pie

03:04.380 --> 03:05.840
 and taking others.

03:07.900 --> 03:11.700
 I think that those people have to be very opposed

03:11.700 --> 03:16.140
 to any sort of thinking that could restructure society

03:16.140 --> 03:21.140
 or conventions about who should succeed.

03:21.940 --> 03:25.220
 And so firstly, I mean by that

03:25.220 --> 03:30.220
 that it becomes much more dangerous for a person

03:31.020 --> 03:35.320
 to think deeply and question during a time

03:35.320 --> 03:38.620
 when the important people are those concerned

03:38.620 --> 03:41.540
 with making sure no one rocks the boat.

03:41.540 --> 03:45.660
 One example of this would be Socrates and his execution

03:45.660 --> 03:47.500
 because everyone was happy enough

03:47.500 --> 03:50.740
 to sit through his questions before there was war

03:50.740 --> 03:52.100
 and poverty and distress,

03:52.100 --> 03:54.540
 and afterwards it just became too dangerous.

03:54.540 --> 03:58.660
 The other thing I mean by that is that the consequences

03:58.660 --> 04:03.140
 of thinking deeply carry much greater potential

04:03.140 --> 04:06.940
 for real catastrophe when everyone is desperate.

04:06.940 --> 04:11.820
 So like for example, the communist manifesto

04:11.820 --> 04:16.820
 was probably much more dangerous during early 1900s Russia

04:16.900 --> 04:19.780
 than it was during the 1848 revolutions

04:19.780 --> 04:22.860
 because I think people were in much worse shape

04:24.300 --> 04:27.460
 and desperate people are very willing to dive

04:27.460 --> 04:30.960
 into anything new that might bring the future

04:30.960 --> 04:33.300
 without fully calculating

04:33.300 --> 04:36.560
 whatever the consequences or risks might be.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.120
 So it is both more dangerous for a person

04:39.120 --> 04:42.300
 to have creative ideas and those ideas

04:42.300 --> 04:46.960
 are more dangerous when times are tough.

04:46.960 --> 04:51.100
 And by dangerous you mean it challenges the people

04:51.100 --> 04:55.080
 with power who want to maintain that power

04:55.080 --> 04:59.400
 in times of stagnation when there's not much growth,

04:59.400 --> 05:01.820
 innovation, creativity, all that kind of stuff.

05:01.820 --> 05:06.220
 Right, and we know that if nothing new is created,

05:06.220 --> 05:10.220
 people have promises that they've made

05:10.220 --> 05:14.460
 about what will be paid to whom, what debt structure is.

05:14.460 --> 05:19.460
 The only possibility if stagnation lasts for long enough

05:20.980 --> 05:24.300
 is really some kind of great conflict, great war

05:24.300 --> 05:25.940
 because people have to take from others

05:25.940 --> 05:28.740
 to make good on their own promises.

05:28.740 --> 05:33.740
 So we know that by denying any sort of grand ideation

05:33.740 --> 05:36.940
 we are accepting that there will be

05:36.940 --> 05:39.820
 some kind of great catastrophe.

05:39.820 --> 05:42.820
 And so we have to understand that philosophy

05:42.820 --> 05:47.340
 is the most important when we've seen

05:47.340 --> 05:49.580
 too much stagnation for too long.

05:49.580 --> 05:53.220
 It is also very dangerous

05:53.220 --> 05:55.180
 and it's dangerous for the people who are doing it

05:55.180 --> 05:57.980
 and it's dangerous for the people who believe it

05:57.980 --> 06:00.300
 but it's kind of our only way out ever.

06:00.300 --> 06:03.820
 And again, by philosophy you mean the bigger,

06:03.820 --> 06:05.220
 so it's not academic philosophy

06:05.220 --> 06:08.900
 or this kind of games played in the space

06:08.900 --> 06:12.140
 of just like moral philosophy and all those metaphysics,

06:12.140 --> 06:12.980
 all that kind of stuff.

06:12.980 --> 06:15.660
 You mean just thinking deeply about this world,

06:15.660 --> 06:17.580
 thinking from first principles.

06:17.580 --> 06:22.100
 I think your like Twitter line involves something about like.

06:22.100 --> 06:24.820
 Trying to piece everything together from first principles.

06:24.820 --> 06:27.780
 So that's fundamentally what being philosophical

06:27.780 --> 06:31.180
 about this world is and that's where the people

06:31.180 --> 06:33.180
 who are thinking deeply about this world

06:33.180 --> 06:36.100
 are the ones who are feeding,

06:36.100 --> 06:39.220
 who are the catalyst of this growth in society and so on.

06:39.220 --> 06:43.060
 Yeah, I mean, I also think that the real implication

06:43.060 --> 06:48.060
 of moral philosophy can be something

06:48.140 --> 06:52.660
 that most would consider like a real political implication.

06:52.660 --> 06:55.980
 So I think all philosophy really ties together

06:55.980 --> 06:58.860
 because there has to be some sort of grand structure

06:58.860 --> 07:01.780
 to all thought and how it relates.

07:01.780 --> 07:06.780
 Do you think this growth and innovation

07:06.780 --> 07:10.300
 and improvement can last forever?

07:10.300 --> 07:12.480
 We've seen some incredible,

07:14.020 --> 07:16.020
 the thing that humans have been able to accomplish

07:16.020 --> 07:20.260
 over the past several hundred years is just,

07:20.260 --> 07:24.940
 I mean, awe inspiring and every moment in that history,

07:24.940 --> 07:27.820
 it almost seemed like no more could be done.

07:27.820 --> 07:30.900
 Like we've solved all the problems that are to be solved.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.500
 And there's just historically,

07:32.500 --> 07:34.100
 there's all these kind of ridiculous

07:34.100 --> 07:35.980
 like Bill Gates style quotes,

07:35.980 --> 07:40.380
 or like it's obvious that this new cool thing

07:40.380 --> 07:43.420
 is not gonna take off and yet it does.

07:43.420 --> 07:47.180
 And so there's a feeling of the same kind of pattern

07:47.180 --> 07:48.220
 that we see in Moore's law.

07:48.220 --> 07:51.180
 There's constant growth in different technologies

07:51.180 --> 07:54.180
 in the modern day era in any kind of automation

07:54.180 --> 07:55.620
 over the past hundred years.

07:55.620 --> 07:58.980
 Do you think it's possible that we'll keep growing this way

07:58.980 --> 08:02.380
 if we give power to the philosophers of our society?

08:02.380 --> 08:05.420
 I think the only way that we can keep growing this way

08:05.420 --> 08:08.280
 is if we give power to real thinkers.

08:09.180 --> 08:11.140
 And there's no guarantee that that will work,

08:11.140 --> 08:13.800
 but we sort of don't have any other choice.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.380
 And I think you're entirely right

08:15.380 --> 08:20.380
 that this period of both understanding the universe

08:20.380 --> 08:25.140
 at a rate which has never been seen before

08:25.140 --> 08:29.060
 and invention and creativity,

08:29.060 --> 08:31.620
 that these past hundred years

08:31.620 --> 08:33.780
 have been sort of uncharacteristic

08:34.800 --> 08:38.320
 for the level of growth that we've seen in all of history.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.160
 We've never seen anything like this.

08:41.160 --> 08:50.500
 And I think a lot of our promises rest on this sort of thing

08:50.500 --> 08:51.780
 continuing.

08:51.780 --> 08:53.540
 I think that's very dangerous.

08:53.540 --> 08:57.660
 But the one thing that can get us out of this is philosophy

08:57.660 --> 09:01.460
 and being ready to radically restructure

09:01.460 --> 09:05.500
 all of our notions about what should be, what is.

09:05.500 --> 09:06.780
 I think that's very important.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.740
 So you think deeply about this world.

09:08.740 --> 09:11.940
 You are clearly the embodiment of a thinker, of a philosopher.

09:12.940 --> 09:16.080
 Your dad is also one such guy, Eric Weinstein.

09:16.980 --> 09:20.060
 Do you have big disagreements with him

09:20.060 --> 09:21.580
 on this topic in particular?

09:21.580 --> 09:23.980
 I think, now people should know,

09:23.980 --> 09:25.700
 he also happens to be in the room,

09:25.700 --> 09:29.780
 but the mics can't pick him up so he can heckle.

09:29.780 --> 09:30.980
 It doesn't even matter.

09:32.020 --> 09:34.580
 But do you have disagreements with him on this point?

09:34.580 --> 09:37.640
 Let me try to summarize his argument

09:37.640 --> 09:42.640
 that we are actually based a lot of our American society

09:42.900 --> 09:45.660
 on the belief that things will keep growing.

09:45.660 --> 09:50.660
 And yet it seems that however you break it apart,

09:50.660 --> 09:52.860
 maybe from an economics perspective,

09:52.860 --> 09:55.140
 that they're not growing currently.

09:55.140 --> 09:57.660
 And so that's where a lot of our troubles are at.

09:57.660 --> 10:00.860
 Do you have the same sense that there's a stagnation period

10:00.860 --> 10:03.460
 that we're living through over the past couple of decades?

10:03.460 --> 10:07.980
 I think stagnation, modern stagnation is completely

10:07.980 --> 10:11.140
 undeniable, particularly scientifically.

10:11.140 --> 10:13.220
 And I think there have been a few fields

10:13.220 --> 10:17.980
 where tremendous progress has been made very recently.

10:17.980 --> 10:22.140
 I think my dad might feel that

10:24.280 --> 10:26.900
 there is sort of an inevitability

10:26.900 --> 10:29.740
 to the ending of this period.

10:29.740 --> 10:34.740
 And I'm not so certain that the fall of this great time

10:36.900 --> 10:39.700
 is completely inevitable because I don't know

10:39.700 --> 10:42.540
 what thoughts we're capable of producing,

10:42.540 --> 10:45.180
 what we're able to reconsider.

10:45.180 --> 10:49.020
 I think we really have to be open to the possibility

10:49.020 --> 10:53.980
 that all of our standard frameworks where,

10:53.980 --> 10:57.640
 like he will talk about embedded growth obligations.

10:57.640 --> 11:00.420
 If we continue within the same framework,

11:00.420 --> 11:02.180
 then we're very susceptible to the dangers

11:02.180 --> 11:05.220
 of whatever these embedded growth obligations are.

11:05.220 --> 11:06.940
 I think if we break the frameworks,

11:06.940 --> 11:09.060
 we have no reason to believe that the problems

11:09.060 --> 11:11.620
 we're experiencing with our current frameworks

11:11.620 --> 11:13.180
 will follow us.

11:13.180 --> 11:15.520
 And I think that's the importance of radical thought

11:15.520 --> 11:17.900
 is we don't know what the solution is,

11:17.900 --> 11:19.180
 but if there is a solution,

11:19.180 --> 11:22.700
 it will be born from some very fundamental thinking.

11:22.700 --> 11:24.780
 And so I have great hope.

11:24.780 --> 11:27.700
 So you have optimism about sort of the power

11:27.700 --> 11:31.140
 of a single radical idea or a single radical thinker

11:31.140 --> 11:36.140
 to break our frameworks and break us out of this,

11:36.420 --> 11:41.420
 like, spiral down due to whatever the economic forces

11:41.620 --> 11:45.300
 that are creating this current stagnation.

11:45.300 --> 11:47.700
 Yeah, I'm very, very hopeful.

11:47.700 --> 11:48.940
 The optimism of youth.

11:48.940 --> 11:52.060
 Well, I share your optimism.

11:52.060 --> 11:56.100
 So let me come back to something you've also talked about.

11:56.100 --> 11:59.200
 You have very little stuff out there currently,

11:59.200 --> 12:02.620
 but the things you have out there, your thoughts,

12:02.620 --> 12:05.300
 you could just tell how deeply you think about this world.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.620
 And one of the things you mentioned is

12:07.620 --> 12:12.500
 as you learn about this world, as you read,

12:12.500 --> 12:16.040
 as you sort of go through different experiences,

12:16.040 --> 12:20.480
 that you're open to changing your mind.

12:20.480 --> 12:23.840
 How often do you find yourself changing your mind?

12:23.840 --> 12:26.340
 Do you think Zev from 10 years into the future

12:26.340 --> 12:29.020
 will look back at this conversation we're having now

12:29.020 --> 12:33.120
 and disagree completely with everything you just said?

12:33.120 --> 12:34.480
 It's entirely possible.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.840
 And that's one of the things that scares me so much

12:36.840 --> 12:39.400
 about appearing publicly.

12:39.400 --> 12:43.240
 I think that the internet can be very intolerant

12:43.240 --> 12:44.840
 of inconsistency.

12:44.840 --> 12:49.380
 And I am entirely prepared to be very inconsistent

12:49.380 --> 12:54.200
 because I know that whatever beliefs I have

12:54.200 --> 12:56.880
 when subjected to scrutiny may change

12:56.880 --> 12:59.120
 because that's really the only way

12:59.120 --> 13:04.120
 to form your truest, most fundamental conceptions

13:04.400 --> 13:06.640
 about the world around you.

13:06.640 --> 13:09.280
 And it would take an infinite amount of time

13:09.280 --> 13:12.920
 to subject every single one of your beliefs to scrutiny.

13:12.920 --> 13:16.080
 And so that's a process that must follow me

13:16.080 --> 13:18.720
 throughout my entire life.

13:18.720 --> 13:23.560
 And I know that means that my opinions and perspectives

13:23.560 --> 13:26.520
 are always to be changing.

13:28.120 --> 13:31.160
 I'm prepared to accept that about myself.

13:31.160 --> 13:34.840
 Whether other people are prepared to accept

13:34.840 --> 13:39.840
 that my public opinions may change

13:42.320 --> 13:45.960
 and vary greatly over time is something I don't know.

13:45.960 --> 13:48.520
 I don't know how tolerant the world will be,

13:48.520 --> 13:53.520
 but I'm very prepared to change anything I believe in

13:53.920 --> 13:55.400
 if I think deeply enough about it

13:55.400 --> 13:59.640
 or a good enough argument is made so that I might reconsider.

13:59.640 --> 14:02.200
 Well, there certainly is currently an intolerance

14:02.200 --> 14:04.880
 and that's one of the problems of our age.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.960
 There's an intolerance towards change.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.960
 And I'll also ask you about labels.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.040
 You talked about sort of we like to bin each other

14:11.040 --> 14:14.120
 into different categories, the blue or red

14:14.120 --> 14:16.980
 or whatever the different categorization is.

14:16.980 --> 14:20.720
 But it seems like the task before you

14:20.720 --> 14:23.200
 as a young person defining our future

14:23.200 --> 14:28.200
 is to make a tolerance of change the norm.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.320
 Doing this podcast, for example,

14:30.320 --> 14:33.040
 and then changing your mind one or two years later

14:33.040 --> 14:36.520
 and doing so publicly without a big dramatic thing

14:36.520 --> 14:38.960
 or maybe changing it on a daily basis

14:39.920 --> 14:42.440
 and just being open about it and being transparent

14:42.440 --> 14:43.720
 about your thought process.

14:43.720 --> 14:48.720
 Maybe that is the beacon of hope for the philosophical way,

14:49.760 --> 14:51.700
 the path of the philosopher.

14:52.540 --> 14:55.320
 So that's your task in a sense

14:55.320 --> 14:58.720
 is to change your mind openly and bravely.

14:58.720 --> 14:59.560
 You know, you're right.

14:59.560 --> 15:03.360
 And maybe I will just have to endure some sort of criticism

15:03.360 --> 15:05.400
 for doing that, but I think that's very important.

15:05.400 --> 15:08.840
 I think this ties back to this previous facet

15:08.840 --> 15:11.600
 of our conversation where we were discussing

15:11.600 --> 15:15.920
 if thinkers would win over systems

15:15.920 --> 15:19.680
 that are devoted to preventing radical thought

15:19.680 --> 15:24.680
 or if who will win the systems or the thinkers.

15:25.920 --> 15:29.120
 I think it's crucial that my generation

15:31.320 --> 15:34.200
 take up a hand in this fight.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.280
 And I think it's important that I'm a part of that

15:37.280 --> 15:40.360
 because I know that I have some opportunity

15:40.360 --> 15:45.360
 to, there is, I think it is my obligation

15:47.480 --> 15:50.960
 as a member of a generation whose only real hope

15:50.960 --> 15:53.280
 is to think outside of a system

15:53.280 --> 15:57.080
 because whatever systems exist are collapsing.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.440
 I think it is really my obligation

15:59.440 --> 16:02.760
 to try to play some role, whatever role I can

16:02.760 --> 16:06.540
 and being an instrument in that change.

16:06.540 --> 16:11.040
 Are you, as a young mind, do you have a sense of fear

16:11.040 --> 16:13.640
 about just like how afraid were you

16:13.640 --> 16:15.520
 to do this podcast conversation?

16:15.520 --> 16:18.520
 Do you have a sense of fear of thinking publicly?

16:19.360 --> 16:23.240
 Yeah, I don't even think that that fear is irrational.

16:23.240 --> 16:28.240
 It's very difficult to exist publicly in any form now

16:28.960 --> 16:33.360
 because it's very easy for anyone to take cheap shots

16:33.360 --> 16:38.240
 at something which is difficult and as I said,

16:39.120 --> 16:43.320
 the people who are trying to have the difficult ideas

16:43.320 --> 16:47.560
 and conversations are perhaps putting others

16:47.560 --> 16:51.520
 in actual danger because everyone is so desperate

16:51.520 --> 16:55.380
 that they might be willing to try anything.

16:55.380 --> 16:59.120
 So there's a certain amount of responsibility

16:59.120 --> 17:03.440
 which one has to take going before the public

17:03.440 --> 17:07.820
 and there is a certain amount of ridicule

17:07.820 --> 17:10.620
 which will be completely unwarranted

17:10.620 --> 17:14.280
 that anyone must endure for it.

17:15.840 --> 17:20.120
 And I think that means that one has to be afraid

17:20.120 --> 17:22.040
 because they could both ruin the world

17:22.040 --> 17:23.760
 and be ruined by the world

17:23.760 --> 17:28.760
 in an unwarranted and undeserved fashion.

17:31.480 --> 17:34.000
 I would like to believe in myself enough

17:34.000 --> 17:35.960
 to try to accept this as a task

17:35.960 --> 17:39.760
 because I think people need to try

17:39.760 --> 17:41.000
 or there's no getting out of this

17:41.000 --> 17:44.740
 and we will end in some kind of crazy, brilliant war.

17:44.740 --> 17:45.580
 Awfully put.

17:45.580 --> 17:48.480
 You've said also that in these times we can't have labels

17:48.480 --> 17:51.400
 because it holds us back.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.540
 Maybe we've already talked about it a little bit

17:53.540 --> 17:56.540
 but this idea of labels is really interesting.

17:56.540 --> 17:59.560
 Why do you think labels hold us back?

17:59.560 --> 18:04.120
 Well, I think many underestimate the extent

18:04.120 --> 18:09.120
 to which language and communication really impacts

18:09.420 --> 18:12.600
 and shapes the ideas and thoughts

18:12.600 --> 18:14.740
 which are being communicated.

18:14.740 --> 18:19.740
 And I think if we're willing to accept imperfect labels

18:19.740 --> 18:23.000
 to categorize particular people or thoughts,

18:23.000 --> 18:27.200
 in some sense, we are corrupting an abstraction

18:27.200 --> 18:30.160
 in order to represent it and communicate about it.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.120
 And I think as we've discussed,

18:33.120 --> 18:36.320
 those abstractions are particularly important

18:36.320 --> 18:37.880
 when everything is on fire.

18:41.880 --> 18:46.880
 We should not be sacrificing grand thoughts

18:46.880 --> 18:49.720
 for the ability to express it.

18:49.720 --> 18:53.560
 I think everyone should work much harder,

18:53.560 --> 18:56.280
 including myself, to really be thinking abstractly

18:56.280 --> 19:00.000
 in abstract terms instead of using concrete terms

19:00.000 --> 19:04.680
 to discuss abstraction while ruining it slightly.

19:04.680 --> 19:07.520
 Yeah, it's kind of a skill actually.

19:07.520 --> 19:12.520
 So one really difficult example in the recent time

19:12.520 --> 19:17.520
 that maybe you can comment on if you have been thinking

19:21.200 --> 19:23.460
 about it is just politics.

19:23.460 --> 19:25.600
 And there's a lot of labels in politics

19:25.600 --> 19:29.080
 that it takes a lot of skill to be able

19:29.080 --> 19:31.400
 to communicate difficult ideas

19:31.400 --> 19:34.040
 without labels being attached to you.

19:34.040 --> 19:37.280
 That's something that I've been sort of thinking about a lot

19:37.280 --> 19:40.120
 in trying to express, for example,

19:40.120 --> 19:44.160
 how much I love various aspects of the foundational ideas

19:44.160 --> 19:46.360
 of this country, like freedom,

19:46.360 --> 19:50.640
 and just saying, I love America, a simple statement.

19:50.640 --> 19:53.260
 I love the ideas that we're finding to America.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.360
 Well, often in the current time,

19:55.360 --> 19:57.760
 well, people will try, they desperately try

19:57.760 --> 20:00.320
 to attach a label to me, for example,

20:00.320 --> 20:03.960
 for saying I love America, that I'm a Republican,

20:03.960 --> 20:07.080
 a Donald Trump supporter, and it takes elegance

20:07.080 --> 20:12.080
 and grace and skill to avoid those labels

20:12.240 --> 20:13.780
 so that people can actually listen

20:13.780 --> 20:15.680
 to the contents of your words

20:15.680 --> 20:20.040
 versus the summarization that results

20:20.040 --> 20:24.400
 from just the labels that they can pin on you.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.120
 Are you cognizant of the skill required there

20:27.120 --> 20:28.440
 of being able to communicate

20:28.440 --> 20:31.520
 without being branded a Republican or a Democrat

20:31.520 --> 20:34.000
 in this particular set of conversations?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.960
 I'm sure there's other dangerous labels

20:35.960 --> 20:37.160
 that could be attached.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.300
 I don't think there's any way of avoiding that right now.

20:42.300 --> 20:47.300
 It might not be anyone's best effort to really try.

20:47.520 --> 20:52.140
 I think the thing I can say, which will most speak to that,

20:52.140 --> 20:57.140
 which I truly believe, is that participating

20:57.400 --> 21:01.040
 in modern conventional politics

21:01.040 --> 21:04.560
 is not being inherently political

21:04.560 --> 21:06.480
 in a generative sense.

21:06.480 --> 21:11.480
 It's this repeated trope where politics now

21:11.960 --> 21:14.920
 is not about creating new political ideologies.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.720
 It's about defending ideologies which already exist

21:17.720 --> 21:20.580
 so that everyone can keep what they have.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.280
 And that's where all of the name calling

21:23.280 --> 21:26.520
 and the labeling really comes in.

21:26.520 --> 21:31.520
 It's an attempt to constrict whatever may be generated

21:31.520 --> 21:36.520
 to standard conversations and discussions

21:37.580 --> 21:42.460
 so that arguments can be straw manned and defeated

21:42.460 --> 21:43.940
 and people can keep what they have

21:43.940 --> 21:47.020
 because everyone's very, very scared.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.660
 I want to be very political,

21:51.660 --> 21:54.680
 but not in a standard political sense

21:54.680 --> 21:57.540
 where I'm defending a particular party

21:57.540 --> 22:00.300
 or place on a spectrum.

22:00.300 --> 22:04.740
 I would like to play some role in inventing new spectrums

22:04.740 --> 22:07.260
 and I think that's most important politically

22:07.260 --> 22:12.260
 because above most else, politics is about real power

22:13.740 --> 22:17.060
 and conventional politicians have real power

22:17.980 --> 22:21.320
 and that power will find terrible outlets

22:21.320 --> 22:25.220
 if new spectrums for that power to live are not invented.

22:26.540 --> 22:28.020
 So you're not afraid of politics.

22:28.020 --> 22:30.940
 You're afraid of political discourse at the deepest,

22:30.940 --> 22:35.060
 richest level of what political discourse is supposed to mean.

22:35.060 --> 22:39.100
 Actually, I'm very afraid of it, but once again, we have no.

22:39.100 --> 22:41.020
 That's not paralyzing for you.

22:41.020 --> 22:42.300
 You feel like it's a responsibility,

22:42.300 --> 22:43.600
 you're ready to take it on.

22:43.600 --> 22:44.800
 Yes.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.340
 This is a good sign.

22:46.340 --> 22:48.540
 This is, you're a special human.

22:48.540 --> 22:51.680
 Okay, let's talk maybe fun, maybe profound.

22:52.860 --> 22:55.380
 We talked about philosophers, philosophy.

22:55.380 --> 22:57.500
 Who's your favorite philosopher?

22:57.500 --> 23:01.740
 Like somebody in your current time but neither influential

23:01.740 --> 23:06.380
 or you just enjoy his, her ideas

23:06.380 --> 23:08.900
 or writing or anything like that?

23:08.900 --> 23:11.540
 Weirdly, I'll give an answer

23:11.540 --> 23:14.720
 which sort of doesn't have much to do

23:14.720 --> 23:18.580
 with whom I might imagine myself to be.

23:18.580 --> 23:21.660
 I like Thomas Aquinas at the moment.

23:21.660 --> 23:24.260
 I think he's very inspirational to me

23:24.260 --> 23:26.260
 given what we're going through

23:26.260 --> 23:30.700
 and that's not because his particular ideas

23:30.700 --> 23:35.700
 of religion or God or unmoved movers

23:35.780 --> 23:40.780
 are particularly inspirational to me

23:40.980 --> 23:44.100
 and I don't even think they were necessarily right.

23:45.340 --> 23:50.340
 But he was introducing aspects of the scientific method

23:52.100 --> 23:55.460
 during one of the darkest periods in human history

23:55.460 --> 23:57.940
 when we had lost all hope and reason

23:57.940 --> 24:01.260
 and ability to think logically.

24:01.260 --> 24:06.100
 So I think he was really something of a light in the dark

24:06.100 --> 24:09.420
 and I think we need to look to people like that

24:09.420 --> 24:10.540
 at the moment.

24:10.540 --> 24:15.540
 The other reason why I think I need to learn from him

24:15.860 --> 24:18.660
 is that even though he was doing something

24:18.660 --> 24:20.660
 which really needed to be done

24:20.660 --> 24:25.660
 and introducing scientific thought and reason

24:25.700 --> 24:29.040
 to a time that lacked it,

24:30.420 --> 24:35.020
 he was not saying anything that would have been offensive

24:35.020 --> 24:39.140
 to whatever powers were in play during his time.

24:39.140 --> 24:43.560
 He was writing about the importance of faith in God

24:43.560 --> 24:45.580
 and how we could prove it.

24:45.580 --> 24:49.980
 And so it's important to remember, I suppose,

24:49.980 --> 24:54.980
 that having ideas that shape the world

24:55.500 --> 24:58.780
 and which bring the world closer to what we can prove

24:58.780 --> 25:01.140
 it's supposed to be and how it's supposed to work

25:01.140 --> 25:04.140
 does not always take some sort of grand contradiction

25:04.140 --> 25:05.520
 of whatever's in play.

25:06.700 --> 25:09.660
 And the most courageous thing to do

25:09.660 --> 25:13.400
 may not always be the most helpful thing to do.

25:13.400 --> 25:18.400
 And I think it's very easy for anyone with ideas

25:18.400 --> 25:23.200
 about how everything is broken to become very cynical

25:23.200 --> 25:25.920
 and say, oh, the system, man, they're all wrong.

25:27.840 --> 25:32.600
 I think it takes another kind of discipline

25:32.600 --> 25:35.320
 to be a person with real ideas

25:35.320 --> 25:38.400
 and to make the world better

25:38.400 --> 25:41.960
 without stepping on anyone's toes or contradicting anyone.

25:41.960 --> 25:43.160
 I have real respect for that.

25:43.160 --> 25:44.520
 So being able to be,

25:44.520 --> 25:46.360
 when it's within your principles to operate,

25:46.360 --> 25:48.600
 within the current system of thought.

25:48.600 --> 25:53.600
 Yeah, and not offend anyone, not say anything outlandish,

25:54.360 --> 25:57.080
 but introduce the method

25:57.080 --> 26:00.360
 by which progress must be achieved.

26:00.360 --> 26:03.520
 I think that takes a kind of maturity,

26:03.520 --> 26:07.480
 which is found very rarely now.

26:07.480 --> 26:10.280
 And I really look to him for inspiration

26:10.280 --> 26:13.120
 despite whatever disagreements I may have

26:13.120 --> 26:16.120
 with the minute details of his philosophy.

26:16.120 --> 26:20.360
 Yeah, it takes a lot of skill, a lot of character,

26:20.360 --> 26:23.480
 and yeah, deep thinking to be able to operate

26:23.480 --> 26:25.200
 within the system when needed

26:25.200 --> 26:29.840
 and having the fortitude and just the boldness

26:29.840 --> 26:33.320
 to step outside and to burn the system down when needed,

26:33.320 --> 26:36.400
 but rarely, and opportune moments

26:36.400 --> 26:38.080
 that would actually have impact.

26:38.080 --> 26:40.520
 I mean, it's ultimately about impact

26:40.520 --> 26:42.480
 within the society that you live in,

26:42.480 --> 26:46.480
 not just making a statement that has no impact.

26:46.480 --> 26:50.080
 Yeah, and we were talking about how dangerous it is

26:50.080 --> 26:55.080
 to do real philosophy at dangerous broken times.

26:55.840 --> 26:59.000
 He was going through the most broken time in history

26:59.000 --> 27:04.000
 and he questioned the methods

27:05.120 --> 27:10.120
 which made a broken system able to survive.

27:10.120 --> 27:12.120
 And he was so skilled and so graceful

27:12.120 --> 27:15.680
 that he became a saint in that tradition.

27:15.680 --> 27:19.080
 And there's something for me to really learn from there.

27:19.080 --> 27:20.400
 Do you draw any inspiration,

27:20.400 --> 27:23.320
 have any interest in the sort of more modern philosophers,

27:23.320 --> 27:25.320
 maybe the existentialists?

27:25.320 --> 27:27.640
 I mean, Nietzsche is one of the early ones.

27:27.640 --> 27:31.640
 Do you have thoughts on the guy in general

27:31.640 --> 27:34.040
 or any of the other existentialists?

27:34.040 --> 27:36.480
 Well, with regard to Nietzsche,

27:36.480 --> 27:40.840
 I think Yates might've said that he's the worst.

27:40.840 --> 27:44.040
 He was certainly filled with passionate intensity.

27:46.320 --> 27:47.160
 I think...

27:47.160 --> 27:48.000
 Was that a compliment?

27:48.000 --> 27:52.240
 He was the worst or a criticism or both?

27:52.240 --> 27:53.640
 Yates had this big line,

27:53.640 --> 27:55.480
 that the best lack all conviction,

27:55.480 --> 27:58.680
 the worst are filled with passionate intensity.

27:59.760 --> 28:04.760
 So I think Nietzsche was destroyed

28:04.760 --> 28:09.760
 by the horrors of everything that went on around him.

28:10.800 --> 28:14.800
 And I think he never really recovered from it.

28:14.800 --> 28:19.800
 I think that's because if you think about Nietzsche's

28:20.880 --> 28:25.880
 philosophy, he was very opposed to any sort of acceptance

28:25.880 --> 28:26.920
 of what one had.

28:26.920 --> 28:29.200
 One should always envy those who have more

28:29.200 --> 28:33.200
 and use that envy to fuel their ideas.

28:33.200 --> 28:38.200
 To fuel their growth and accept whatever

28:39.880 --> 28:42.960
 the human condition and desires are

28:42.960 --> 28:46.680
 and use those desires to want more and more

28:46.680 --> 28:49.920
 and make use of your greed.

28:49.920 --> 28:54.920
 I think it's very difficult to be truly happy

28:54.920 --> 29:03.920
 if the thing which you pride yourself most on

29:03.920 --> 29:07.520
 is never being satisfied.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.280
 And I think Nietzsche was never satisfied

29:09.280 --> 29:12.200
 and that was the danger of his philosophy.

29:12.200 --> 29:15.360
 I think also with his amoralism,

29:15.360 --> 29:18.000
 there is no good or evil.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.680
 I sort of disagree with that on a pretty fundamental basis.

29:22.680 --> 29:27.680
 I think that our notion of morality

29:27.760 --> 29:29.840
 is by no means subjective.

29:29.840 --> 29:34.840
 It's really the proxy for the fitness of a society.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.160
 I think whatever we consider ethical,

29:39.160 --> 29:41.920
 like don't steal, don't murder, don't do this,

29:44.360 --> 29:47.320
 societies have a very difficult time running.

29:47.320 --> 29:48.880
 It's very hard to run a civilization

29:48.880 --> 29:51.720
 when everyone is stealing from everyone else

29:51.720 --> 29:54.080
 and people are murdering each other

29:54.080 --> 29:56.680
 and committing these things,

29:56.680 --> 30:00.480
 which we would consider atrocities.

30:00.480 --> 30:03.680
 So I think we also, we know this

30:03.680 --> 30:07.200
 because I think very similar notions of morality

30:07.200 --> 30:12.200
 have evolved convergently from different traditions.

30:12.800 --> 30:17.800
 I think good is a proxy for a civilization's fitness

30:17.800 --> 30:22.800
 and the good news is that that means that evil

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
 in being anathema to that good

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
 must therefore be the opposite of stable

30:33.040 --> 30:34.920
 in whatever way that it's evil.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.680
 And that means that good will always be more stable

30:37.680 --> 30:41.440
 than evil and the only way evil can really win

30:41.440 --> 30:43.320
 is like if everyone dies.

30:43.320 --> 30:46.240
 So I think that's a good thing.

30:46.240 --> 30:48.120
 Everyone dies, so.

30:49.400 --> 30:51.360
 So wait, can you say that again?

30:51.360 --> 30:54.240
 Good is a proxy for society's what?

30:54.240 --> 30:56.600
 Good is a proxy for the stability

30:56.600 --> 30:59.760
 and fitness of a civilization and evil.

30:59.760 --> 31:01.000
 Damn, that's a good definition.

31:01.000 --> 31:01.840
 Thank you.

31:01.840 --> 31:02.920
 So you're throwing some bombs today.

31:02.920 --> 31:03.760
 Okay, all right.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.880
 Okay, this is exciting.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.240
 Sorry, sorry to interrupt your flow there,

31:11.240 --> 31:12.880
 but it's just a damn good line.

31:12.880 --> 31:13.720
 Thank you.

31:13.720 --> 31:14.560
 Yeah.

31:15.440 --> 31:18.280
 So in that sense, that's a kind of optimistic view

31:18.280 --> 31:21.480
 that if by definition good is a proxy for stability,

31:21.480 --> 31:22.920
 then it's going to be stable

31:22.920 --> 31:25.880
 unless the entire world just blows itself up.

31:25.880 --> 31:28.360
 So good wins in the end by definition.

31:28.360 --> 31:29.480
 Yeah.

31:29.480 --> 31:34.480
 Or no, well, good wins unless it all goes

31:35.600 --> 31:39.080
 to complete destruction.

31:39.080 --> 31:40.320
 That's beautifully put.

31:40.320 --> 31:41.160
 Thank you.

31:41.160 --> 31:46.160
 On a topic of sort of good and evil being human illusions,

31:49.120 --> 31:53.920
 you've said that more broadly than that about truth,

31:53.920 --> 31:56.880
 that it is easier in some ways to be unified under truth

31:56.880 --> 31:59.800
 because it is universal than it is to be unified

31:59.800 --> 32:02.960
 under belief, which at times can be completely subjective.

32:02.960 --> 32:06.560
 So what is the nature of truth to you?

32:06.560 --> 32:09.800
 Can we understand the world objectively

32:09.800 --> 32:12.920
 or is most of what we can understand about the world

32:12.920 --> 32:16.880
 is just a subjective opinions

32:16.880 --> 32:20.280
 that we kind of all agree on in these little collectives

32:20.280 --> 32:25.080
 and over time it kind of evolves completely detached

32:25.080 --> 32:26.560
 from objective reality.

32:26.560 --> 32:31.080
 I think this is the greatest argument for objectivity

32:32.160 --> 32:35.480
 is that something that is objectively true

32:35.480 --> 32:40.200
 cannot be true to me and untrue to you.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.400
 You can feel that it's untrue,

32:42.400 --> 32:45.520
 but that would be unproductive

32:45.520 --> 32:50.520
 and create unnecessary tension and conflict.

32:50.520 --> 32:55.520
 I think this is one reason for the importance of science

32:55.880 --> 32:58.760
 as a tool for stability.

32:58.760 --> 33:07.760
 If science is the search for truth and truth can never really be,

33:07.760 --> 33:08.760
 I shouldn't say that,

33:08.760 --> 33:12.840
 truth should never be an engine of conflict

33:12.840 --> 33:15.800
 because no two people should disagree on something

33:15.800 --> 33:18.480
 which is objectively true,

33:18.480 --> 33:22.520
 then in some sense, search for truth is searching

33:22.520 --> 33:27.240
 for a common ground where we can all exist

33:27.240 --> 33:32.240
 and live without contradicting or attacking each other.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.680
 Do you have a hope that there is a lot of common ground

33:34.680 --> 33:36.360
 to be discovered?

33:36.360 --> 33:39.280
 Sure, I mean, if we continue scientifically,

33:41.080 --> 33:42.720
 we are discovering truth

33:42.720 --> 33:45.120
 and in that discovering common ground

33:45.120 --> 33:46.600
 on which we can all agree.

33:46.600 --> 33:51.240
 That's one reason why I think caring about science,

33:51.240 --> 33:54.600
 if you have a culture which cares very deeply about science,

33:54.600 --> 33:59.160
 that's a culture which is not necessarily bound

33:59.160 --> 34:04.120
 to injure unwarranted internal conflict.

34:04.120 --> 34:06.000
 I think that's one reason that I'm so passionate

34:06.000 --> 34:09.400
 about science is it's search for universal ground.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.600
 Let me just throw out an example

34:11.600 --> 34:14.400
 of a modern day philosophical thinker.

34:14.400 --> 34:17.240
 We'll keep your dad, Eric Weinstein out of the picture

34:17.240 --> 34:21.080
 for a sec, but he does happen to be an example of one,

34:21.080 --> 34:23.600
 but Jordan Peterson is an example of another,

34:23.600 --> 34:25.800
 somebody who thinks deeply about this world.

34:26.760 --> 34:30.400
 His ideas are by a certain percent of the population,

34:30.400 --> 34:33.640
 sort of speaking of truth, are labeled as dangerous.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.720
 Why do you think his ideas

34:36.720 --> 34:40.760
 or just ideas of these kinds of deep thinkers in general

34:40.760 --> 34:43.920
 are labeled as dangerous in our modern world?

34:43.920 --> 34:46.320
 Is it similar to what you've been discussing

34:46.320 --> 34:50.720
 that in difficult times, philosophers become dangerous?

34:50.720 --> 34:52.320
 Or is there something specific

34:52.320 --> 34:54.920
 about these particular thinkers in our time?

34:54.920 --> 34:58.880
 Well, I think Jordan Peterson is very anti establishment

34:58.880 --> 35:01.320
 in a lot of his beliefs.

35:01.320 --> 35:03.760
 He's an unconventional thinker.

35:03.760 --> 35:08.760
 And I think we need, regardless of whatever

35:10.200 --> 35:13.240
 Jordan's particular views and beliefs are,

35:13.240 --> 35:18.240
 and if they bring about more danger than truth,

35:18.240 --> 35:21.720
 or if they don't, it's very important

35:21.720 --> 35:24.560
 to have fundamental thinkers

35:24.560 --> 35:28.760
 who exist outside of a conventional framework.

35:28.760 --> 35:33.280
 So do I think that he's dangerous?

35:33.280 --> 35:38.280
 I think by existing outside of a system which is known,

35:40.600 --> 35:41.680
 he is dangerous.

35:41.680 --> 35:45.880
 And I think we have to, in some sense,

35:45.880 --> 35:50.280
 in some sense, we have to welcome danger in that capacity

35:50.280 --> 35:53.840
 because it will be our only way out of this.

35:53.840 --> 35:58.840
 So regardless of whether his beliefs are right or wrong,

36:03.480 --> 36:06.200
 I'm pretty adamant about the fact

36:06.200 --> 36:11.200
 that we need to support thought which may rescue us.

36:11.200 --> 36:16.200
 And that thought can appear radical or dangerous at times.

36:16.440 --> 36:19.280
 But ultimately, if you allow for it,

36:20.160 --> 36:22.280
 this is kind of the difficult discussion of free speech

36:22.280 --> 36:27.280
 and so on, is ultimately difficult ideas

36:27.920 --> 36:30.720
 will pave the way for progress.

36:30.720 --> 36:34.280
 Yeah, and I'd actually, I'd like to slow you down there

36:34.280 --> 36:37.800
 because I think like one of the issues

36:37.800 --> 36:40.840
 we were discussing previously was the fact

36:40.840 --> 36:45.840
 that language often destroys our ability to think.

36:48.240 --> 36:52.120
 When we're talking about whether his ideas are radical,

36:52.120 --> 36:55.960
 I don't know if we mean radical in the traditional sense

36:55.960 --> 37:00.120
 of having to do with the root of a problem

37:00.120 --> 37:05.120
 or in the more modern sense of being very extreme.

37:05.560 --> 37:09.800
 And I think that's completely by design,

37:09.800 --> 37:13.360
 I think fundamental thought,

37:13.360 --> 37:18.360
 which semantically would once be considered radical thought

37:18.880 --> 37:20.640
 became very dangerous.

37:20.640 --> 37:23.120
 And now it's become synonymous with extreme

37:23.120 --> 37:26.120
 or dangerous thought, which means that anyone

37:26.120 --> 37:29.000
 who considers themselves a radical thinker

37:29.000 --> 37:34.000
 is semantically also a dangerous or extreme thinker.

37:36.480 --> 37:38.680
 These are not helpful labels in a sense

37:38.680 --> 37:42.960
 that the moment you say radical or extremist thinker,

37:42.960 --> 37:46.720
 then you're just, well, how do I put it?

37:46.720 --> 37:51.720
 You're not helping the public discourse, exchange of ideas.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.840
 But through no fault of our own,

37:54.840 --> 37:58.160
 the concept of radical as having to do with a root

37:58.160 --> 38:03.160
 is it's an obvious concept for which there must be language

38:03.160 --> 38:06.920
 and a lot of the attack on thought has to do

38:06.920 --> 38:11.920
 with attacking language, which communicates conceptually.

38:12.840 --> 38:16.120
 So like this is an example of how our world

38:16.120 --> 38:18.960
 is becoming increasingly Orwellian.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.360
 It's just language is being used to destroy

38:21.360 --> 38:23.600
 our ability to think.

38:23.600 --> 38:26.000
 I think I can't remember exactly what the numbers are,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.800
 but I read some statistic about how greatly

38:28.800 --> 38:32.400
 the average English vocabulary has been used

38:32.400 --> 38:36.440
 and the vocabulary has decreased since 1960.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.400
 It was like some incredible number.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.880
 It really baffled me.

38:39.880 --> 38:44.360
 It's like, how are people less able to think in a time

38:44.360 --> 38:46.480
 when the world is supposed to be growing

38:46.480 --> 38:50.400
 at a never before seen rate?

38:50.400 --> 38:54.400
 It's like, we can't keep on, we can't sustain this growth

38:54.400 --> 38:58.440
 if we destroy everyone's ability to think

38:58.440 --> 39:00.960
 because the growth requires thinking

39:00.960 --> 39:05.520
 and we're ruining the tools for it.

39:05.520 --> 39:09.440
 I watched your podcast with Noam Chomsky

39:09.440 --> 39:14.000
 and I think one interesting thing which he discussed

39:14.000 --> 39:18.440
 was how language is more used to develop thoughts

39:18.440 --> 39:21.600
 within our own head than it is used to communicate

39:21.600 --> 39:24.040
 those thoughts with others.

39:24.040 --> 39:28.080
 If the language doesn't change, even if its usage changes,

39:28.080 --> 39:32.320
 when language is destroyed in communication,

39:32.320 --> 39:37.320
 it also stymies our ability to think reasonably

39:38.640 --> 39:40.680
 and I'm very, very worried.

39:41.600 --> 39:46.600
 But the language in communication requires a medium

39:46.960 --> 39:48.280
 and there's a lot of different mediums.

39:48.280 --> 39:51.440
 So there's social media, there's Twitter,

39:51.440 --> 39:54.880
 there's writing books, there's blog posts,

39:54.880 --> 39:59.880
 there's podcasts, there's YouTube videos,

40:00.800 --> 40:04.800
 all of things you have dipped a toe in

40:04.800 --> 40:08.320
 in your exploration of different mediums of communication.

40:08.320 --> 40:12.680
 Which do you see yourself, this might be just a poetic way

40:12.680 --> 40:14.200
 of asking are you gonna do a podcast,

40:14.200 --> 40:19.120
 but broader picture, what do you think as an intellectual

40:19.120 --> 40:22.880
 in this world for you personally

40:22.880 --> 40:26.600
 would be the path for communicating your ideas to the world?

40:26.600 --> 40:30.040
 What are the mediums you are currently drawn to

40:30.040 --> 40:33.400
 out of the ones I mentioned or maybe something I didn't?

40:33.400 --> 40:38.400
 To answer your question concretely before abstractly,

40:39.600 --> 40:42.720
 I'm scared but I need to do a podcast.

40:42.720 --> 40:45.880
 It's important, it is my obligation

40:45.880 --> 40:47.720
 as a member of my generation.

40:47.720 --> 40:51.160
 I really hope that more people my age start to do this

40:51.160 --> 40:56.160
 because we will be the people in charge of new ideas

40:56.160 --> 40:59.120
 which either sink or swim.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.320
 How upset will your dad be

41:01.320 --> 41:04.680
 when your podcast quickly becomes more popular than his?

41:04.680 --> 41:07.240
 I think he would be negatively upset.

41:07.240 --> 41:09.640
 I'll say he'd be proud, he's a good dad.

41:09.640 --> 41:11.960
 I really think so, yeah.

41:11.960 --> 41:13.680
 Sorry to interrupt.

41:13.680 --> 41:17.000
 Yeah, so but then zooming out, do you think podcasts,

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
 are you excited by the possibility

41:20.000 --> 41:24.080
 of other mediums outside of podcasting to communicate ideas?

41:24.080 --> 41:27.360
 I would be if people still read books

41:27.360 --> 41:28.840
 or did things like that.

41:30.800 --> 41:33.440
 I'm somewhat guilty of this.

41:33.440 --> 41:36.440
 A lot of the books I read are very technical

41:38.960 --> 41:43.960
 and then my, to absorb like really deep modern conversations

41:43.960 --> 41:48.960
 I listen to podcasts and I don't really read many books

41:52.360 --> 41:55.440
 on like the matters that we're discussing, for example.

41:55.440 --> 41:57.480
 It's fascinating because you're making me think

41:57.480 --> 42:00.800
 of something that I align with you very much

42:00.800 --> 42:03.480
 of how I consume deep thinkers currently.

42:03.480 --> 42:05.480
 So what happens is somebody who thinks deeply

42:05.480 --> 42:10.280
 about the world will write a book, Jordan Peterson example,

42:10.280 --> 42:12.020
 and instead of reading their book,

42:12.020 --> 42:14.360
 I'll just listen to podcast conversations

42:14.360 --> 42:17.780
 of them talking about the book, which I find to,

42:19.000 --> 42:22.240
 this is really sad, but I find that to be

42:22.240 --> 42:25.720
 a more compelling way to think about their ideas

42:25.720 --> 42:28.800
 because they're often challenged in certain ways

42:28.800 --> 42:31.840
 in those conversations and they're forced to,

42:31.840 --> 42:34.200
 after having boiled them down and really thought

42:34.200 --> 42:36.240
 through them enough to write a book.

42:36.240 --> 42:38.480
 So it's almost like they needed to go through the process

42:38.480 --> 42:41.280
 of writing a book just so they could think through,

42:41.280 --> 42:43.080
 convert the language in their minds

42:43.080 --> 42:44.480
 into something more concrete,

42:44.480 --> 42:47.600
 and then the actual exchange of ideas,

42:47.600 --> 42:49.960
 the actual communication of ideas with the public happens

42:49.960 --> 42:52.960
 not with the book, but after the book,

42:52.960 --> 42:55.240
 with that person going on a book tour

42:56.360 --> 42:58.120
 and communicating the ideas.

42:58.120 --> 43:00.880
 Well, there are two meanings I make

43:00.880 --> 43:03.880
 of why not too many people spend much

43:03.880 --> 43:05.920
 of their time reading anymore.

43:05.920 --> 43:10.400
 One interpretation is that we've lost our attention spans

43:10.400 --> 43:13.600
 to our phones, people can't concentrate on a page

43:13.600 --> 43:15.360
 if it takes them a minute to read,

43:15.360 --> 43:18.960
 we're too busy watching TikToks or whatever people do.

43:20.000 --> 43:24.320
 The other interpretation would be that language

43:24.320 --> 43:28.200
 and verbal communication has,

43:28.200 --> 43:31.020
 as well as some amount of communication,

43:31.020 --> 43:33.880
 which is done through facial expression,

43:33.880 --> 43:35.440
 tone of voice, et cetera.

43:35.440 --> 43:38.000
 These are means of communication

43:38.000 --> 43:42.160
 that have evolved along with humanity

43:42.160 --> 43:44.560
 over thousands and thousands of years.

43:44.560 --> 43:49.560
 So we know that we are built to communicate in this way.

43:51.920 --> 43:56.920
 We have had writing for much less time.

43:57.940 --> 43:59.900
 It is a system that we invented,

43:59.900 --> 44:04.640
 not a system which evolved and is innately part

44:04.640 --> 44:09.640
 of humanity or the human mind.

44:11.520 --> 44:16.520
 And so we are designed to consume conversation

44:16.680 --> 44:18.560
 by our own evolution.

44:18.560 --> 44:22.880
 We are designed to consume writing

44:24.180 --> 44:26.000
 by some process of symbols

44:26.000 --> 44:28.360
 that's evolved over a couple of thousand years.

44:28.360 --> 44:33.360
 It makes sense to me why many are much more compelled

44:35.840 --> 44:38.600
 to listen to podcasts, for example,

44:38.600 --> 44:41.280
 than they are to read books.

44:41.280 --> 44:46.280
 It could be that this is simply a technological progression

44:47.640 --> 44:52.640
 which has displaced reading conventionally

44:52.640 --> 44:57.480
 instead of some sort of maladaptation of our minds,

44:57.480 --> 45:01.320
 which has corrupted our attention spans.

45:01.320 --> 45:03.480
 Likely there's some combination

45:03.480 --> 45:07.440
 which determines why people spend much less time reading.

45:07.440 --> 45:10.680
 But I don't think it's necessarily because we're all broken.

45:10.680 --> 45:12.640
 It may simply have to do with the fact

45:12.640 --> 45:16.640
 that we are designed to listen through our ears

45:16.640 --> 45:17.720
 and speak through our mouths.

45:17.720 --> 45:22.720
 And we are not innately designed to communicate over a page.

45:25.040 --> 45:26.760
 Yeah, there's an exciting coupling to me

45:26.760 --> 45:30.600
 between like few second TikTok videos

45:30.600 --> 45:32.280
 that are fun and addicting,

45:32.280 --> 45:34.840
 and then the three, four hour podcasts,

45:34.840 --> 45:39.040
 which are both really popular in our current time.

45:39.040 --> 45:42.600
 So people are both hungry for the visual stimulation

45:42.600 --> 45:45.520
 of internet humor and memes.

45:45.520 --> 45:50.520
 I'm a huge fan of, and also slow moving deep conversations.

45:53.080 --> 45:56.320
 And that might, you know, there's a lot of,

45:56.320 --> 45:57.840
 I mean, it's part of your generation

45:57.840 --> 45:59.880
 to define what that looks like moving forward.

45:59.880 --> 46:02.240
 There were a lot of people, like Joe Rogan's

46:02.240 --> 46:05.600
 one of the people that kind of started,

46:05.600 --> 46:08.560
 accidentally stumbled into the discovery

46:08.560 --> 46:10.280
 that this is like a thing.

46:10.280 --> 46:13.880
 And now people are kind of scrambling to figure out

46:13.880 --> 46:15.400
 why is this a thing?

46:15.400 --> 46:16.800
 Like, why is there so much hunger

46:16.800 --> 46:18.720
 for long form conversations?

46:18.720 --> 46:21.100
 And how do we optimize that medium

46:21.100 --> 46:23.480
 for further, further expression of deep ideas

46:23.480 --> 46:24.640
 and all that kind of stuff.

46:24.640 --> 46:27.480
 And YouTube is a really interesting medium

46:27.480 --> 46:28.880
 for that as well.

46:28.880 --> 46:31.800
 Like video, sharing of videos,

46:31.800 --> 46:35.240
 mostly YouTube is used with a spirit of like

46:35.240 --> 46:37.440
 the TikTok spirit, if I can put it in that way,

46:37.440 --> 46:41.100
 which is like, how do I have quick moving things

46:41.100 --> 46:43.120
 that even if you're expressing difficult ideas,

46:43.120 --> 46:46.360
 they should be quick and exciting and visual and switching.

46:46.360 --> 46:48.200
 But there's a lot of exploration there

46:48.200 --> 46:50.720
 to see what can we do something deeper

46:50.720 --> 46:52.480
 and nobody knows.

46:52.480 --> 46:56.700
 And you're part of the, you have a YouTube channel

46:56.700 --> 46:58.980
 releasing one video every few years.

47:00.240 --> 47:03.520
 So, so your momentum is currently quite slow,

47:03.520 --> 47:05.160
 but perhaps it'll accelerate.

47:05.160 --> 47:08.880
 You're one of the people that gets to define that medium.

47:08.880 --> 47:12.680
 Is that, do you enjoy that, the visual YouTube medium

47:12.680 --> 47:14.440
 of communication as well?

47:14.440 --> 47:19.440
 I know that when the topic of conversation

47:21.560 --> 47:26.560
 or the means by which a conversation is communicated

47:26.860 --> 47:28.740
 or an idea is communicated,

47:28.740 --> 47:32.240
 if that is sufficiently interesting to me,

47:34.560 --> 47:35.780
 I will read a book on it.

47:35.780 --> 47:37.380
 I would listen to a podcast on it.

47:37.380 --> 47:40.720
 I would watch a video on it.

47:40.720 --> 47:42.920
 I think if I'm very curious about something,

47:43.880 --> 47:46.400
 I will consume it however possible.

47:46.400 --> 47:48.640
 I think when I have to consume things

47:48.640 --> 47:51.300
 which really don't interest me very much,

47:52.620 --> 47:55.720
 I'm indeed much more ready to consume them

47:55.720 --> 47:57.880
 through some sort of video or discussion

47:57.880 --> 48:01.840
 than I am through like a long tedious book.

48:01.840 --> 48:05.960
 So for the breadth of acquiring knowledge,

48:05.960 --> 48:06.920
 video is good.

48:06.920 --> 48:11.160
 For the depth, the medium doesn't matter.

48:11.160 --> 48:12.920
 I think it'd be fun to ask you about

48:12.920 --> 48:16.180
 some big philosophical questions

48:16.180 --> 48:17.880
 to see if you have an opinion on them.

48:17.880 --> 48:21.400
 Do you think there's a free will

48:21.400 --> 48:24.080
 or is free will just an illusion?

48:24.080 --> 48:28.600
 Well, I think classical mechanics would tell us

48:28.600 --> 48:33.600
 that if we were to know every piece of information

48:33.900 --> 48:36.180
 about a system and understand the rules

48:36.180 --> 48:38.160
 which govern that system,

48:38.160 --> 48:42.360
 we would be completely able to predict the future

48:42.360 --> 48:44.240
 with complete accuracy.

48:44.240 --> 48:49.240
 So if something could know everything about our lives,

48:50.400 --> 48:53.360
 it could freeze time and understand the position

48:53.360 --> 48:56.760
 of every neuron in my mind about to fire,

48:58.280 --> 49:02.640
 no decision could be unpredictable.

49:02.640 --> 49:07.640
 In some sense, there is that sort of fate.

49:07.940 --> 49:11.980
 I think that doesn't make the decisions we make illegitimate

49:11.980 --> 49:14.940
 even if some grand supercomputer could

49:16.820 --> 49:19.940
 understand what decisions we would make beforehand

49:19.940 --> 49:21.540
 with complete certainty.

49:21.540 --> 49:24.300
 I think we're making legitimate systems

49:24.300 --> 49:26.100
 within a system that has no freedom.

49:27.420 --> 49:29.140
 We're making legitimate systems

49:29.140 --> 49:30.740
 within a system that has no freedom.

49:30.740 --> 49:33.580
 Can you explain what you mean by that?

49:33.580 --> 49:38.580
 Yeah, so if we were to have just a simple pendulum

49:40.120 --> 49:43.980
 and I told you how long the rope was,

49:44.780 --> 49:47.820
 we froze it at a particular point

49:47.820 --> 49:52.460
 and I told you how high above the ground the weight was

49:52.460 --> 49:57.060
 and the motion of a pendulum is something

49:57.060 --> 50:02.060
 which is easy for everyone to imagine, I could,

50:03.140 --> 50:04.900
 if we had all of that information,

50:04.900 --> 50:08.540
 you could ask me what will the pendulum do

50:08.540 --> 50:10.100
 six and a half minutes from now?

50:10.100 --> 50:12.860
 And we would have a precise answer.

50:12.860 --> 50:16.100
 That's an example of a very simple system

50:16.100 --> 50:17.960
 with a very simple Lagrangian.

50:19.220 --> 50:23.180
 And we could completely predict the future.

50:23.180 --> 50:26.740
 The pendulum has no ability to do anything

50:26.740 --> 50:28.540
 that would surprise us.

50:28.540 --> 50:33.540
 Weirdly, that's true of whatever this four dimensional,

50:35.060 --> 50:40.060
 crazy world we live in looks like if we were to understand

50:41.860 --> 50:44.740
 where every piece of this system was at any given time

50:44.740 --> 50:47.300
 and we understand the laws of motion,

50:47.300 --> 50:49.740
 how everything worked,

50:49.740 --> 50:52.420
 if we could compute all of that information somehow,

50:52.420 --> 50:55.040
 which we will never be able to do,

50:55.040 --> 51:00.040
 we would, every decision you will ever make

51:00.500 --> 51:03.020
 could be predicted by that computer.

51:03.020 --> 51:05.580
 That doesn't mean that your decisions are illegitimate.

51:05.580 --> 51:08.040
 You are really making those decisions,

51:08.040 --> 51:10.980
 but with a completely predictable outcome.

51:10.980 --> 51:14.580
 So I'm just sort of a little bit high at the moment

51:14.580 --> 51:19.420
 on the poetry of a system within a system

51:19.420 --> 51:21.260
 that has no freedom.

51:21.260 --> 51:25.640
 So the human experience is the system we've created.

51:25.640 --> 51:27.240
 Within the system that has no freedom,

51:27.240 --> 51:29.180
 but that system that we've created

51:30.140 --> 51:35.140
 has a feeling of freedom that, to us,

51:35.540 --> 51:40.540
 ants feels as much more real than the physics,

51:44.660 --> 51:48.940
 as we understand it, of the underlying base system.

51:48.940 --> 51:51.460
 So it's almost like not important

51:51.460 --> 51:53.780
 what the physics of the base system is,

51:53.780 --> 51:56.100
 that for what we've created,

51:56.100 --> 52:01.100
 the nature of the human experience is there is a free will.

52:02.500 --> 52:06.540
 Or there is something that feels close enough to a free will

52:06.540 --> 52:11.540
 that it may not be worth spending too much time

52:14.140 --> 52:16.940
 on the fact that it's something of an illusion.

52:16.940 --> 52:19.300
 We will never build a computer that knows everything

52:19.300 --> 52:23.340
 about every piece of the universe at a given time.

52:23.340 --> 52:25.540
 And so for all intensive purposes,

52:26.640 --> 52:28.700
 our decisions are up to us.

52:28.700 --> 52:30.900
 We just happen to know that their outcomes

52:30.900 --> 52:33.420
 could be predicted with enough information.

52:33.420 --> 52:36.380
 So speaking of supercomputers,

52:36.380 --> 52:37.780
 they can predict every single thing

52:37.780 --> 52:40.620
 about what's going to ever happen.

52:41.620 --> 52:46.420
 What do you think about the philosophical thought experiment

52:46.420 --> 52:48.900
 of us living in a simulation?

52:48.900 --> 52:52.100
 Do you often find yourself pondering

52:52.100 --> 52:54.780
 of us living in a simulation of this question?

52:54.780 --> 52:57.980
 Do you think it is at all a useful thought experiment?

52:57.980 --> 53:02.020
 I think it's very easy to become fascinated

53:02.020 --> 53:03.900
 with all of these possibilities,

53:03.900 --> 53:07.460
 and they're completely legitimate possibilities.

53:10.140 --> 53:15.140
 Is there some validity to solipsism?

53:15.140 --> 53:18.420
 Well, it can never be falsified or disproven.

53:18.420 --> 53:22.420
 So, I mean, sure, you could be a figment of my imagination.

53:24.820 --> 53:27.500
 It doesn't mean that I will act according

53:27.500 --> 53:28.900
 to this possibility.

53:28.900 --> 53:30.700
 I'm not gonna call you mean names.

53:30.700 --> 53:34.220
 And just to test the system,

53:34.220 --> 53:37.220
 to see how robust it is to distortions.

53:37.220 --> 53:40.620
 Yeah, so, I mean, all of these existential

53:40.620 --> 53:42.660
 thought experiments are completely possible.

53:42.660 --> 53:45.420
 We could be brains in jars.

53:45.420 --> 53:50.420
 It doesn't mean that our experience will feel any less valid.

53:51.540 --> 53:53.820
 And so it doesn't make a difference to me

53:53.820 --> 53:58.820
 if you are some number of ones and zeros,

53:59.580 --> 54:02.500
 or you are a figment of my imagination,

54:02.500 --> 54:05.820
 which lives in a stored away brain.

54:06.820 --> 54:10.540
 It will never really change my experience

54:10.540 --> 54:12.540
 knowing that that's a possibility.

54:12.540 --> 54:17.540
 And so I try to avoid making decisions

54:19.500 --> 54:21.860
 based on such contemplations.

54:21.860 --> 54:25.340
 If we take this previous issue of free will,

54:27.180 --> 54:32.180
 I could decide that because I have no choice in my life,

54:34.220 --> 54:39.220
 if I lie around in bed all day and eat chips,

54:39.340 --> 54:41.140
 I was destined to do that thing.

54:41.140 --> 54:43.100
 And if I make that decision, then I was destined

54:43.100 --> 54:44.180
 to do that thing.

54:44.180 --> 54:47.060
 It would be a really poor decision for me to make.

54:47.060 --> 54:51.220
 I have school and a dozen commitments.

54:51.220 --> 54:53.700
 There's somebody listening to this right now,

54:53.700 --> 54:56.460
 probably hundreds of people sitting down,

54:56.460 --> 54:59.020
 eating chips and feeling terrible about them.

54:59.020 --> 55:00.580
 So how dare you, sir?

55:00.580 --> 55:02.380
 If they're listening to this,

55:02.380 --> 55:07.380
 they're clearly curious about possibilities of thought.

55:07.380 --> 55:10.780
 It's not the bed and the chips that makes the man.

55:10.780 --> 55:13.540
 It's not the bed or the chips that makes the man.

55:13.540 --> 55:16.300
 Yet another quotable from Zev Weinstein.

55:16.300 --> 55:17.140
 Okay.

55:18.580 --> 55:21.220
 But you don't think of it as a useful thought experiment

55:21.220 --> 55:26.220
 from an engineering perspective of virtual reality,

55:26.220 --> 55:28.020
 of thinking how we can create

55:28.020 --> 55:30.140
 further and further immersive worlds.

55:30.140 --> 55:32.380
 Like would it be possible to create worlds

55:32.380 --> 55:35.220
 that are so immersive that we would rather live

55:35.220 --> 55:38.060
 in that world versus the real world?

55:38.060 --> 55:40.420
 I mean, that's another possible trajectory

55:40.420 --> 55:42.820
 of the world that you're growing up in

55:42.820 --> 55:47.340
 is we're more and more immersing ourselves

55:47.340 --> 55:48.780
 into the digital world.

55:48.780 --> 55:51.260
 For now it's screens and looking at the screens

55:51.260 --> 55:52.900
 and socializing on the screens.

55:52.900 --> 55:55.220
 But it's possible to potentially create a world

55:55.220 --> 55:58.940
 that's also visually for all of our human senses

55:58.940 --> 56:01.940
 as immersive as the physical world.

56:01.940 --> 56:06.100
 And then, you know, to me it's an engineering question

56:06.100 --> 56:08.580
 of how difficult is it to create a world

56:08.580 --> 56:11.660
 that's as immersive and more fun

56:11.660 --> 56:14.540
 than the world we currently live in.

56:14.540 --> 56:16.780
 It's a terrifying concept and I hate to say it.

56:16.780 --> 56:20.300
 We might live happier lives in a virtual reality headset

56:20.300 --> 56:24.100
 30 years from now than we are currently living.

56:24.100 --> 56:27.500
 This future, the digital future, worries you.

56:28.460 --> 56:29.700
 It worries me.

56:29.700 --> 56:34.700
 On the other hand, it may be a better alternative

56:34.900 --> 56:39.900
 to fighting for whatever people are clinging onto

56:40.660 --> 56:44.940
 in our non virtual world or at least the world

56:44.940 --> 56:47.380
 that we don't yet know is virtual.

56:47.380 --> 56:49.140
 So embrace the future.

56:49.140 --> 56:52.460
 We've been talking a lot about thinkers.

56:52.460 --> 56:59.780
 Now, in the broad definition of philosophy,

56:59.780 --> 57:03.540
 you kind of included innovators of all form.

57:03.540 --> 57:06.060
 Do you find it useful to draw a distinction

57:06.060 --> 57:08.020
 between thinkers and doers?

57:08.020 --> 57:13.020
 I think that the most important gift we've ever been given

57:13.980 --> 57:18.100
 is our ability to observe the universe

57:18.100 --> 57:21.660
 and think deductively about whatever principles,

57:21.660 --> 57:23.820
 transcend humanity.

57:23.820 --> 57:28.820
 Because as we discussed, that's the closest thing

57:28.820 --> 57:32.300
 we will ever have to a universal experience

57:32.300 --> 57:36.940
 is understanding things, which must be true everywhere.

57:36.940 --> 57:41.940
 In order for that, so I think if we're deciding

57:42.580 --> 57:46.100
 that life is meaningful and the human experience

57:46.100 --> 57:50.220
 is meaningful, you could make a very convincing argument

57:50.220 --> 57:54.140
 that its greatest meaning will be understanding

57:54.140 --> 57:55.660
 whatever transcends it.

57:58.300 --> 58:03.300
 I think that's only sustainable if people are happy

58:05.540 --> 58:10.540
 and well fed and things of market value are invented.

58:14.260 --> 58:19.180
 And so I think we really need both to live meaningful

58:19.180 --> 58:23.900
 and successful and possible lives.

58:23.900 --> 58:28.780
 In terms of who my greatest heroes are,

58:28.780 --> 58:33.780
 I can't decide between figures like Einstein

58:34.100 --> 58:37.700
 and Newton and Feynman, and on the other hand,

58:37.700 --> 58:42.700
 figures like Carey Mullis, for example.

58:43.500 --> 58:48.340
 I think people like Einstein make our lives meaningful

58:48.340 --> 58:53.180
 and people like Carey Mullis, who's probably responsible

58:53.180 --> 58:55.820
 for saving hundreds of millions of lives,

58:55.820 --> 59:00.820
 make our lives possible and good.

59:02.300 --> 59:06.860
 So in terms of where I would like to find myself

59:10.620 --> 59:14.580
 with these two different notions of achievement,

59:14.580 --> 59:18.300
 I don't know what I would more like to achieve.

59:18.300 --> 59:22.260
 I have an inclination that it will be something scientific

59:22.260 --> 59:25.140
 because I would like to bring meaning to humanity

59:25.140 --> 59:30.140
 instead of sustenance, but I think both are very important.

59:31.340 --> 59:33.500
 We can't sustain our lives

59:33.500 --> 59:36.180
 if we don't keep growing technologically.

59:36.180 --> 59:38.620
 I think people like you are making that possible

59:38.620 --> 59:42.220
 with computing because that's one of the few things

59:42.220 --> 59:47.220
 that's really moving forward in a clear sense.

59:49.980 --> 59:53.420
 I think about this a great deal.

59:53.420 --> 59:56.380
 So I think both are very important.

59:56.380 --> 1:00:00.580
 So one example that's modern day inspiring figure

1:00:00.580 --> 1:00:02.780
 on the latter part, on the engineering part,

1:00:02.780 --> 1:00:05.900
 on the sustenance, is Elon Musk.

1:00:05.900 --> 1:00:09.420
 Does that somebody you draw inspiration from?

1:00:09.420 --> 1:00:13.380
 What are your thoughts in general about the kind

1:00:13.380 --> 1:00:18.380
 of unique spec of human that's creating

1:00:18.860 --> 1:00:23.860
 so much inspiring innovation in this world so boldly?

1:00:25.700 --> 1:00:29.500
 I know that we will not survive without people like that.

1:00:32.100 --> 1:00:36.900
 Elon is a ridiculous and sensational example

1:00:36.900 --> 1:00:39.740
 of one of these figures.

1:00:39.740 --> 1:00:44.620
 I don't know if he's the best example or the worst example,

1:00:44.620 --> 1:00:48.180
 but he is of his own kind.

1:00:48.180 --> 1:00:50.860
 He is radically individualistic,

1:00:50.860 --> 1:00:54.460
 and those are the people who will allow us

1:00:54.460 --> 1:00:57.980
 to continue as humans.

1:00:57.980 --> 1:01:01.020
 I'm very happy that we have people like that in this world.

1:01:01.020 --> 1:01:05.460
 You said this thing about if we are to say

1:01:05.460 --> 1:01:10.460
 that life has meaning or life is meaningful,

1:01:10.620 --> 1:01:15.180
 then you could argue that it is a worthy pursuit

1:01:15.180 --> 1:01:17.620
 to transcend life.

1:01:18.900 --> 1:01:23.900
 Do you see that, another just, I'm gonna have to go back

1:01:25.220 --> 1:01:26.300
 and sleep on that one.

1:01:28.900 --> 1:01:32.260
 Do you draw some, speaking of Elon,

1:01:32.260 --> 1:01:37.260
 some inspiration of us transcending Earth,

1:01:40.900 --> 1:01:45.900
 of us moving outside of this particular planet

1:01:46.460 --> 1:01:48.220
 that we've called home for a long time

1:01:48.220 --> 1:01:50.380
 and colonizing other planets,

1:01:50.380 --> 1:01:53.860
 and perhaps one day expanding outside the solar system

1:01:53.860 --> 1:01:58.580
 and expanding, colonizing our galaxy and beyond?

1:01:58.580 --> 1:02:01.780
 Honestly, I know very little about space exploration.

1:02:01.780 --> 1:02:05.740
 I think it makes complete sense to me

1:02:05.740 --> 1:02:09.780
 why we are starting to think very seriously about it.

1:02:09.780 --> 1:02:14.780
 It's an amazing and baffling and innovative solution

1:02:15.300 --> 1:02:20.300
 to a lot of problems we see as a world population.

1:02:21.140 --> 1:02:26.140
 I can't really offer very much of interest on the topic.

1:02:26.140 --> 1:02:31.140
 I think when I'm talking about transcending humanity

1:02:31.140 --> 1:02:36.140
 and transcending Earth, I'm talking usually

1:02:37.060 --> 1:02:41.140
 about deriving truth, and that's one of the things

1:02:41.140 --> 1:02:45.820
 that makes theoretical math and physics so interesting.

1:02:45.820 --> 1:02:50.340
 It's like, I really, really love biology, for example,

1:02:50.340 --> 1:02:56.340
 but biology is a combination of whatever principles

1:02:57.020 --> 1:03:00.700
 ensure evolution and whatever weird coincidences

1:03:00.700 --> 1:03:02.380
 happened billions of years ago.

1:03:03.620 --> 1:03:05.260
 So do you think it's more interesting to understand

1:03:05.260 --> 1:03:07.820
 the fundamental mechanisms of evolution, for example,

1:03:07.820 --> 1:03:12.380
 than it is the results, the messy results of its processes?

1:03:12.380 --> 1:03:14.100
 I can't say which is more interesting.

1:03:14.100 --> 1:03:17.340
 I can say which I think is more deep.

1:03:17.340 --> 1:03:23.340
 I think theory and abstraction, which can be achieved

1:03:23.340 --> 1:03:28.860
 completely deductively, is deeper because it has nothing

1:03:28.860 --> 1:03:31.660
 to do with circumstance and everything to do

1:03:31.660 --> 1:03:34.580
 with logic and thought.

1:03:35.620 --> 1:03:40.940
 So, like, if we were ever to interact with aliens,

1:03:40.940 --> 1:03:46.940
 for example, we would not have our biology in common

1:03:46.940 --> 1:03:52.940
 if these were some sort of really intelligent life form.

1:03:52.940 --> 1:03:58.940
 We would have math and physics in common because the laws

1:03:58.940 --> 1:04:03.940
 of physics will be the same everywhere in the universe.

1:04:05.460 --> 1:04:12.060
 Our particular anatomy and biology pertains only to life

1:04:12.060 --> 1:04:15.580
 on this planet, and the principles may apply

1:04:15.580 --> 1:04:17.180
 more ubiquitously.

1:04:17.180 --> 1:04:20.300
 Do you ever think about aliens, like, what they might look like?

1:04:20.300 --> 1:04:24.540
 I try to, when I deal with thought experiments like these,

1:04:24.540 --> 1:04:29.740
 I try to keep a very abstract mindset,

1:04:29.740 --> 1:04:35.100
 and I notice that whenever I try to instantiate

1:04:35.100 --> 1:04:41.500
 these abstractions, I corrupt whatever thoughts there are

1:04:41.500 --> 1:04:42.940
 for which they're useful.

1:04:42.940 --> 1:04:45.180
 So it's kind of like the labels discussion.

1:04:45.180 --> 1:04:48.140
 So, like, the moment you try to make it concrete,

1:04:48.140 --> 1:04:50.220
 it's probably going to look like some cute version

1:04:50.220 --> 1:04:54.460
 of a human, like, it's the little green fellas

1:04:54.460 --> 1:04:56.700
 with the eyes and so on, or whatever.

1:04:56.700 --> 1:04:59.340
 Whatever the movies have instilled,

1:04:59.340 --> 1:05:01.980
 like, your cultural upbringing, you're going to project

1:05:01.980 --> 1:05:04.060
 onto that and the assumptions you have.

1:05:04.700 --> 1:05:05.340
 That's interesting.

1:05:05.340 --> 1:05:07.900
 So you prefer to sort of step away and think

1:05:07.900 --> 1:05:10.380
 and abstract notions of what it means to be intelligent,

1:05:10.380 --> 1:05:12.700
 what it means to be a living life form

1:05:12.700 --> 1:05:13.580
 and all that kind of stuff.

1:05:13.580 --> 1:05:17.740
 Mm hmm. I try to, I almost try to pretend I'm blind

1:05:17.740 --> 1:05:22.220
 and I'm deaf and I'm only a mind

1:05:22.220 --> 1:05:24.940
 with no inductive reasoning capacity

1:05:24.940 --> 1:05:28.780
 when I'm trying to think about thought experiments like these,

1:05:28.780 --> 1:05:32.940
 because I know that if I incorporate

1:05:33.580 --> 1:05:37.740
 whatever my eyes instruct my brain,

1:05:37.740 --> 1:05:47.180
 I will impede my ability to think as deeply as possible.

1:05:47.180 --> 1:05:50.940
 Because once again, it's the thing which shallows our thought

1:05:50.940 --> 1:05:54.300
 can be the incorporation of circumstance and coincidence.

1:05:54.300 --> 1:05:57.260
 And for particular kinds of thought, that's very important.

1:05:57.260 --> 1:05:59.740
 I'm not discounting the use of inductive reasoning

1:06:00.460 --> 1:06:02.940
 in many humanities and in many sciences,

1:06:03.580 --> 1:06:06.220
 but for the deepest of thoughts,

1:06:06.220 --> 1:06:09.820
 once again, I feel it's important to try to transcend

1:06:09.820 --> 1:06:14.380
 whatever methods of observation characterize human experience.

1:06:14.380 --> 1:06:17.100
 See, but within that, that's all really beautifully put.

1:06:17.100 --> 1:06:22.700
 I wonder if there is a common mathematics

1:06:22.700 --> 1:06:25.900
 and a common physics between us and alien beings,

1:06:26.780 --> 1:06:30.780
 we still have to make concrete the methods of communication.

1:06:31.580 --> 1:06:32.080
 Yeah.

1:06:32.780 --> 1:06:34.700
 And that's a fascinating question of like,

1:06:34.700 --> 1:06:37.340
 while remaining in these abstract fundamental ideas,

1:06:37.340 --> 1:06:39.420
 how do we communicate with them?

1:06:39.980 --> 1:06:41.900
 I mean, I suppose that that question could be applied

1:06:41.900 --> 1:06:45.100
 to different cultures on earth,

1:06:45.100 --> 1:06:47.980
 but it's finding a common language.

1:06:48.780 --> 1:06:50.940
 Do you think about that kind of problem

1:06:50.940 --> 1:06:55.100
 of basically communicating abstract fundamental ideas?

1:06:55.100 --> 1:06:58.860
 My least favorite aspect of math or physics

1:06:58.860 --> 1:07:01.020
 or any of these really deep sciences

1:07:01.020 --> 1:07:05.340
 is the symbolic component. You know, I'm dyslexic.

1:07:05.340 --> 1:07:08.140
 I don't like looking at symbols.

1:07:08.140 --> 1:07:12.380
 They're too often a source of ambiguity.

1:07:12.380 --> 1:07:15.100
 And I think you're entirely right that if one thing

1:07:15.100 --> 1:07:21.900
 holds us back with communication

1:07:22.460 --> 1:07:26.380
 with something that behaves or looks nothing like us,

1:07:26.380 --> 1:07:29.260
 I think if one thing holds us back

1:07:29.260 --> 1:07:35.580
 it will be symbols and the communication of deep thought.

1:07:35.580 --> 1:07:38.140
 Because as I said, I think communication

1:07:38.140 --> 1:07:41.660
 frequently compromises thought by intention

1:07:41.660 --> 1:07:46.380
 or by just theoretical inadequacy.

1:07:46.380 --> 1:07:47.900
 So on this topic, actually,

1:07:47.900 --> 1:07:50.140
 it'd be fun to see what your thoughts are.

1:07:50.140 --> 1:07:54.860
 Do you think math is invented or discovered?

1:07:54.860 --> 1:07:59.020
 So you said that math, we might share many different things.

1:07:59.020 --> 1:08:04.780
 Some ideas of mathematics and physics with alien life forms.

1:08:04.780 --> 1:08:10.860
 So it's uniform in some sense of uniform throughout the universe.

1:08:10.860 --> 1:08:15.020
 Do you think this thing that we call mathematics

1:08:15.020 --> 1:08:19.580
 is something that's kind of fundamental to the world we live in

1:08:19.580 --> 1:08:24.540
 or is it just some kind of pretty axioms and theorems

1:08:24.540 --> 1:08:26.700
 we've come up with to try to describe

1:08:26.700 --> 1:08:28.860
 the patterns we see in the world?

1:08:28.860 --> 1:08:31.740
 I think it's completely discovered

1:08:31.740 --> 1:08:35.020
 and completely fundamental to all experience.

1:08:35.020 --> 1:08:38.380
 I think the only component of mathematics

1:08:38.380 --> 1:08:41.340
 that has been invented is the expression of it.

1:08:41.340 --> 1:08:47.820
 And I think in some sense, there's almost an arrogance

1:08:47.820 --> 1:08:55.820
 required to believe that whatever aspect we invent

1:08:55.820 --> 1:09:00.620
 having to do with math and physics and theory,

1:09:00.620 --> 1:09:05.180
 there is an arrogance required to truly believe

1:09:05.180 --> 1:09:07.420
 that that belongs on any sort of stage

1:09:07.420 --> 1:09:12.300
 with the actual beauty of the matters being discovered.

1:09:12.300 --> 1:09:21.340
 So we need our minds and in some sense our pens

1:09:21.340 --> 1:09:26.140
 to be able to play with these things

1:09:26.140 --> 1:09:28.460
 and communicate about them.

1:09:28.460 --> 1:09:33.660
 And those hands and those pens are the things

1:09:33.660 --> 1:09:36.540
 which smudge the most beautiful thing

1:09:36.540 --> 1:09:40.300
 that humanity can ever experience.

1:09:40.300 --> 1:09:48.140
 And maybe if we interact with some intelligent life form,

1:09:48.140 --> 1:09:51.020
 they will have their own unique smudges.

1:09:51.020 --> 1:09:55.180
 But the canvas, which is beautiful,

1:09:55.180 --> 1:09:57.100
 must be identical because that is

1:09:57.100 --> 1:09:59.260
 universal and ubiquitous truth.

1:09:59.260 --> 1:10:01.580
 And that's what makes it deep and meaningful

1:10:01.580 --> 1:10:05.740
 is that it's so much more important than whatever

1:10:05.740 --> 1:10:10.220
 we're programmed to enjoy as an aspect of human experience.

1:10:10.220 --> 1:10:13.740
 Yeah, that's really beautifully put.

1:10:13.740 --> 1:10:17.820
 The human language is these messy smudges

1:10:17.820 --> 1:10:20.060
 of trying to express something underlying that

1:10:20.060 --> 1:10:23.500
 is beautiful.

1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:26.860
 Speaking of that, on the physics side,

1:10:26.860 --> 1:10:31.100
 do you think the pursuit of a theory of everything

1:10:31.100 --> 1:10:34.620
 in physics, as we may call it in our current times,

1:10:34.620 --> 1:10:38.060
 of understanding the basic fabric of reality

1:10:38.060 --> 1:10:41.900
 from a physics perspective is an important pursuit?

1:10:41.900 --> 1:10:44.700
 I think it's essential.

1:10:44.700 --> 1:10:49.340
 As I've said, I think ideation is our only escape

1:10:49.340 --> 1:10:54.540
 from the constraints of human condition.

1:10:54.540 --> 1:10:58.540
 And I think that it's important that all great thoughts

1:10:58.540 --> 1:11:01.620
 and ideas are bound together.

1:11:01.620 --> 1:11:04.580
 And I think the math is beautiful.

1:11:04.580 --> 1:11:07.900
 And it ensures that the things which

1:11:07.900 --> 1:11:11.500
 bind great ideas which have already been had

1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:15.380
 and great discoveries together, it

1:11:15.380 --> 1:11:19.860
 ensures that those strings will be beautiful.

1:11:19.860 --> 1:11:22.620
 I think it's very important to unify

1:11:22.620 --> 1:11:25.980
 all theories that have brought us to where we are.

1:11:25.980 --> 1:11:28.420
 Do you think humans can do it?

1:11:28.420 --> 1:11:30.180
 Do you think humans can solve this puzzle?

1:11:30.180 --> 1:11:33.580
 Is it possible that we, with our limited cognitive capacity,

1:11:33.580 --> 1:11:37.740
 will never be able to truly understand this deep,

1:11:37.740 --> 1:11:42.420
 like deeply understand this underlying canvas?

1:11:42.420 --> 1:11:46.180
 I think if not, it will be people like you

1:11:46.180 --> 1:11:53.140
 who invent some sort of, I don't know,

1:11:53.140 --> 1:11:55.300
 we'll call it computation for now,

1:11:55.300 --> 1:12:02.700
 that will be able to not only discover

1:12:02.700 --> 1:12:06.660
 that which transcends humanity, but to transcend

1:12:06.660 --> 1:12:11.740
 human methods of discovering that which is above it.

1:12:11.740 --> 1:12:14.660
 So superintelligence systems, AGI, and so on,

1:12:14.660 --> 1:12:17.300
 that are better physicists than us.

1:12:17.300 --> 1:12:19.820
 I wonder if you might be able to comment.

1:12:19.820 --> 1:12:21.500
 So your dad does happen to be somebody

1:12:21.500 --> 1:12:27.060
 who boldly seeks this kind of deep understanding of physics,

1:12:27.060 --> 1:12:30.220
 the underlying nature of reality from a physics perspective,

1:12:30.220 --> 1:12:34.900
 from a mathematical physics perspective.

1:12:34.900 --> 1:12:37.140
 Do you have hope your dad figures it out?

1:12:37.140 --> 1:12:38.380
 I have great hope.

1:12:38.380 --> 1:12:41.220
 It's not supposed to be my journey.

1:12:41.220 --> 1:12:42.660
 It's supposed to be his journey.

1:12:42.660 --> 1:12:47.260
 It's supposed to be his to express to the world.

1:12:47.260 --> 1:12:51.180
 Obviously, I'm so proud that I'm connected

1:12:51.180 --> 1:12:55.100
 to someone who is determined to do such a thing.

1:12:55.100 --> 1:12:58.940
 And on the other hand, maybe in some sense,

1:12:58.940 --> 1:13:03.020
 I feel bad for him for having to,

1:13:03.020 --> 1:13:07.140
 if he's going to be the thing which discovers

1:13:07.140 --> 1:13:11.340
 some sort of grand unified theory and expresses it,

1:13:11.340 --> 1:13:16.900
 I feel sorry that he will have to smudge whatever

1:13:16.900 --> 1:13:18.940
 canvas this thing is.

1:13:18.940 --> 1:13:19.900
 Because he's human.

1:13:19.900 --> 1:13:24.820
 Really, I think I know I've seen a little bit of what

1:13:24.820 --> 1:13:27.860
 I think great math and great physics looks like.

1:13:27.860 --> 1:13:31.020
 And it's unbelievably beautiful.

1:13:31.020 --> 1:13:33.460
 And then you have to present it to a world

1:13:33.460 --> 1:13:39.020
 with market constraints and all of this messy sloppiness.

1:13:39.020 --> 1:13:43.580
 I feel bad in some sense for my dad

1:13:43.580 --> 1:13:45.540
 because he has to go back and forth

1:13:45.540 --> 1:13:47.860
 between this beautiful world of math

1:13:47.860 --> 1:13:54.780
 and whatever the messiness is of his human life.

1:13:54.780 --> 1:13:56.260
 And then the scientific community

1:13:56.260 --> 1:13:59.580
 broadly with egos and tensions and just

1:13:59.580 --> 1:14:03.540
 the dynamics of what makes us human.

1:14:03.540 --> 1:14:05.340
 He's also very lucky that he gets to play

1:14:05.340 --> 1:14:07.060
 with these sorts of things.

1:14:07.060 --> 1:14:09.940
 It's a mixed bag.

1:14:09.940 --> 1:14:12.380
 I both feel a little sorry for him

1:14:12.380 --> 1:14:14.980
 for having to deal with the beauty as well as

1:14:14.980 --> 1:14:21.340
 the smudging and the sloppiness of human expression.

1:14:21.340 --> 1:14:32.780
 And I think it's difficult not to envy such a beautiful insight

1:14:32.780 --> 1:14:35.300
 or life or vision.

1:14:35.300 --> 1:14:36.900
 Well, that's your own path as well

1:14:36.900 --> 1:14:41.100
 is this kind of struggle of, as you mentioned,

1:14:41.100 --> 1:14:44.020
 exploring the beauty of different ideas

1:14:44.020 --> 1:14:48.780
 while having to communicate those ideas with the best smudges

1:14:48.780 --> 1:14:52.100
 you can in a world that wants to put labels,

1:14:52.100 --> 1:14:56.260
 that wants to misinterpret, that wants to destroy

1:14:56.260 --> 1:14:57.820
 the beauty of those ideas.

1:14:57.820 --> 1:15:03.060
 And you seem to, at this time, with your youthful enthusiasm,

1:15:03.060 --> 1:15:07.820
 embracing that struggle despite the fear in the face of fear.

1:15:07.820 --> 1:15:13.260
 And your dad also carries that same youthful enthusiasm

1:15:13.260 --> 1:15:14.260
 as well.

1:15:14.260 --> 1:15:18.020
 But that said, your dad, Eric Weinstein,

1:15:18.020 --> 1:15:19.540
 he's a powerful voice, I would say,

1:15:19.540 --> 1:15:22.060
 a powerful intellect in public discourse.

1:15:22.060 --> 1:15:28.500
 Is this a burden for you or an inspiration or both

1:15:28.500 --> 1:15:31.340
 as a young mind yourself?

1:15:31.340 --> 1:15:38.980
 I think, as I said, there's this weird contrast of I

1:15:38.980 --> 1:15:42.380
 know that he has ideas, which I think are very beautiful,

1:15:42.380 --> 1:15:49.420
 and I know he has to deal with the sort of there's something

1:15:49.420 --> 1:15:54.220
 you have to sacrifice in beauty when you bring it

1:15:54.220 --> 1:16:00.060
 to a world which is not always beautiful.

1:16:00.060 --> 1:16:04.820
 And there's an aspect of that which sort of scares me

1:16:04.820 --> 1:16:07.460
 about this kind of thing.

1:16:07.460 --> 1:16:13.180
 I also think that, especially since I'm

1:16:13.180 --> 1:16:16.700
 trying to think about how I should appear publicly,

1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:20.020
 my dad has been very inspirational

1:16:20.020 --> 1:16:24.900
 in that I think he brings a sort of fastidious care

1:16:24.900 --> 1:16:27.660
 to very difficult conversations that.

1:16:27.660 --> 1:16:29.780
 What does fastidious mean?

1:16:29.780 --> 1:16:35.620
 It's just very careful and thoughtful.

1:16:35.620 --> 1:16:39.940
 He brings that sort of attitude to, I think,

1:16:39.940 --> 1:16:42.860
 really difficult conversations.

1:16:42.860 --> 1:16:45.900
 And I know that I don't have that skill yet.

1:16:45.900 --> 1:16:47.860
 I don't think I'm terrible, but.

1:16:47.860 --> 1:16:50.300
 The care, the nuance, and yet not

1:16:50.300 --> 1:16:52.740
 being afraid to push forward.

1:16:52.740 --> 1:16:55.620
 Yeah, I would really like to learn from my dad there.

1:16:55.620 --> 1:17:00.700
 I think also my dad has been very important to my life

1:17:00.700 --> 1:17:05.860
 just because I've always been a sort of very idiosyncratic

1:17:05.860 --> 1:17:07.780
 thinker.

1:17:07.780 --> 1:17:12.020
 And I think I don't always know how

1:17:12.020 --> 1:17:16.580
 to interact with the world for those sorts of reasons.

1:17:16.580 --> 1:17:21.580
 And I think my dad has always been similar.

1:17:21.580 --> 1:17:23.540
 And if not for my dad, I don't know

1:17:23.540 --> 1:17:28.140
 if I would just believe that I was stupid or something.

1:17:28.140 --> 1:17:31.900
 Because I don't know if I would know

1:17:31.900 --> 1:17:36.980
 how to interpret my differences from convention.

1:17:36.980 --> 1:17:42.420
 So he gave you the power to be different

1:17:42.420 --> 1:17:45.780
 and use that as a superpower.

1:17:45.780 --> 1:17:49.060
 Yeah, I guess you could put it that way.

1:17:49.060 --> 1:17:51.220
 I don't know who I would believe I

1:17:51.220 --> 1:17:56.380
 am if I didn't have my dad telling me

1:17:56.380 --> 1:17:58.900
 that it wasn't my own stupidity which

1:17:58.900 --> 1:18:02.980
 alienated me from certain aspects of standard life.

1:18:02.980 --> 1:18:05.900
 So I'm very, very thankful for that.

1:18:05.900 --> 1:18:08.620
 Is there a fond memory you have about an interaction

1:18:08.620 --> 1:18:13.060
 with your dad, either funny, profound, that kind of sticks

1:18:13.060 --> 1:18:15.380
 with you now?

1:18:15.380 --> 1:18:18.180
 A lot.

1:18:18.180 --> 1:18:20.620
 Part of the reason I ask that, of course,

1:18:20.620 --> 1:18:24.700
 is just fascinating to see somebody as brilliant as you,

1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:28.060
 see how the people that you interact with,

1:18:28.060 --> 1:18:30.700
 how they form the mind that you have,

1:18:30.700 --> 1:18:35.180
 but also to give an insight of another public figure

1:18:35.180 --> 1:18:39.740
 like your dad to see from your perspective of what

1:18:39.740 --> 1:18:42.700
 kind of little magical moments happen in private life.

1:18:42.700 --> 1:18:47.380
 I would say I remember I think I just posted about this

1:18:47.380 --> 1:18:50.980
 on Instagram or something.

1:18:50.980 --> 1:18:52.300
 Otherwise, it didn't happen.

1:18:52.300 --> 1:18:53.860
 If you didn't post that, yeah.

1:18:53.860 --> 1:18:56.740
 One person who's always sort of mattered

1:18:56.740 --> 1:19:00.500
 to whatever weird life and experience I've had

1:19:00.500 --> 1:19:03.420
 has been this comedian, Tom Lehrer.

1:19:03.420 --> 1:19:04.740
 Do you know him?

1:19:04.740 --> 1:19:06.580
 Yes.

1:19:06.580 --> 1:19:08.060
 I love him very much.

1:19:08.060 --> 1:19:09.220
 Likewise.

1:19:09.220 --> 1:19:12.820
 Anyway, I remember I think I was five or something.

1:19:12.820 --> 1:19:17.060
 My dad came home with the CD, this Tom Lehrer CD,

1:19:17.060 --> 1:19:19.060
 and he told me to listen to it.

1:19:19.060 --> 1:19:24.180
 And it was all of this bizarre satirical writing

1:19:24.180 --> 1:19:29.100
 about prostitution and cutting up babies

1:19:29.100 --> 1:19:34.020
 and all kinds of ridiculously vile content

1:19:34.020 --> 1:19:35.860
 for a five year old.

1:19:35.860 --> 1:19:42.300
 I think beyond just my love of Tom Lehrer,

1:19:42.300 --> 1:19:46.500
 I think it was a way for my dad to express

1:19:46.500 --> 1:19:50.860
 that from a very young age, he was really

1:19:50.860 --> 1:19:53.180
 ready to treat me like an adult, and he

1:19:53.180 --> 1:20:03.220
 was ready to trust me and share his life and his enjoyments

1:20:03.220 --> 1:20:07.420
 with me in a way that was unconventional

1:20:07.420 --> 1:20:13.940
 because he was willing to discard tradition

1:20:13.940 --> 1:20:19.660
 for the chance at a really unique and meaningful

1:20:19.660 --> 1:20:21.180
 parental relationship.

1:20:21.180 --> 1:20:24.940
 So trusting that his particular brand of weirdness

1:20:24.940 --> 1:20:26.940
 is something you can understand at a young age

1:20:26.940 --> 1:20:28.580
 and embrace and learn from it.

1:20:28.580 --> 1:20:31.540
 Tom Lehrer, we should clarify, is not all about,

1:20:31.540 --> 1:20:33.060
 what is it, murder and prostitution.

1:20:33.060 --> 1:20:36.060
 He's one of the wittiest, most brilliant musical artists.

1:20:36.060 --> 1:20:40.140
 If you haven't listened to his work, you should.

1:20:40.140 --> 1:20:44.940
 He's just a rare intellect who's able to sort of,

1:20:44.940 --> 1:20:49.260
 in catchy rhyme, express some really difficult ideas

1:20:49.260 --> 1:20:52.780
 through satire, I suppose.

1:20:52.780 --> 1:20:55.300
 That still, even though it's decades ago,

1:20:55.300 --> 1:20:58.060
 still resonates today, some of the ideas that he expressed.

1:20:58.060 --> 1:21:02.900
 I will say also that I think I am probably

1:21:02.900 --> 1:21:06.540
 a more cultured person having listened to Tom Lehrer

1:21:06.540 --> 1:21:09.340
 than I would have been without, I think,

1:21:09.340 --> 1:21:13.380
 a lot of his comedy draws upon a canon

1:21:13.380 --> 1:21:15.820
 that I was really driven to research by saying,

1:21:15.820 --> 1:21:16.820
 oh, what does this mean?

1:21:16.820 --> 1:21:18.660
 I don't understand that reference.

1:21:18.660 --> 1:21:20.020
 There are a lot of references there

1:21:20.020 --> 1:21:26.380
 to really inspirational things, which he sort of assumes

1:21:26.380 --> 1:21:28.020
 going into a lot of his songs.

1:21:28.020 --> 1:21:29.660
 And for many of us, like me, you have

1:21:29.660 --> 1:21:33.420
 to piece those things together, looking at Wikipedia pages

1:21:33.420 --> 1:21:33.980
 and whatnot.

1:21:33.980 --> 1:21:37.900
 But to tie this back to the original question,

1:21:37.900 --> 1:21:43.900
 I think there's sort of a break it,

1:21:43.900 --> 1:21:47.260
 you bought it notion of parenting.

1:21:47.260 --> 1:21:53.780
 I think, really, if you're not going to accept a standard,

1:21:53.780 --> 1:21:55.300
 you have to invent your own.

1:21:55.300 --> 1:21:59.660
 And I think, in some ways, that was my dad's way of telling me

1:21:59.660 --> 1:22:04.220
 that if I was too unstandard as a child,

1:22:04.220 --> 1:22:07.740
 he would invent his own way of parenting me

1:22:07.740 --> 1:22:09.500
 because that was worth it to him.

1:22:09.500 --> 1:22:11.540
 And I think that was very meaningful to me.

1:22:11.540 --> 1:22:13.020
 I know you're young.

1:22:13.020 --> 1:22:16.700
 This is a weird time to ask this question.

1:22:16.700 --> 1:22:19.940
 Are you cognizant on the role of love

1:22:19.940 --> 1:22:21.780
 in your relationship with your dad?

1:22:21.780 --> 1:22:25.980
 Are you at a place mentally, as a man yourself,

1:22:25.980 --> 1:22:28.260
 to admit that you love the guy?

1:22:28.260 --> 1:22:32.580
 I love my dad with the connection

1:22:32.580 --> 1:22:36.180
 that I think I've had to very few things in the world.

1:22:36.180 --> 1:22:38.100
 I think my dad is one of the people that's

1:22:38.100 --> 1:22:40.500
 allowed me to see myself.

1:22:40.500 --> 1:22:45.420
 And I don't know who I would imagine myself to be

1:22:45.420 --> 1:22:46.300
 if not for my dad.

1:22:46.300 --> 1:22:49.660
 That isn't to say that I agree with him on everything.

1:22:49.660 --> 1:22:54.660
 But I think he's given me courage to accept myself

1:22:54.660 --> 1:23:00.260
 and to believe that I can teach myself where I'm

1:23:00.260 --> 1:23:02.980
 unable to learn from convention.

1:23:02.980 --> 1:23:07.820
 So I love my dad very dearly, yes.

1:23:07.820 --> 1:23:12.860
 Is there ways in which you wish you could be a better son?

1:23:12.860 --> 1:23:16.780
 Firstly, I'd like to say I'm sure before I figure out

1:23:16.780 --> 1:23:18.620
 exactly what those are.

1:23:18.620 --> 1:23:22.660
 I think whenever I come to conclusions

1:23:22.660 --> 1:23:28.820
 on what that means, I'm eager to take them.

1:23:28.820 --> 1:23:31.020
 What do you mean by that?

1:23:31.020 --> 1:23:32.420
 What do you mean by a conclusion?

1:23:32.420 --> 1:23:35.340
 If I have an idea for how to be a better son,

1:23:35.340 --> 1:23:39.140
 I think I'm inclined to try to be that person.

1:23:39.140 --> 1:23:41.060
 I think that's true of almost anything.

1:23:41.060 --> 1:23:44.820
 I think if I have ideas for improvement,

1:23:44.820 --> 1:23:49.340
 it would be wasteful not to act on them.

1:23:49.340 --> 1:23:55.260
 So I suppose one thing I could say

1:23:55.260 --> 1:24:03.100
 is that I think idealism and what could almost

1:24:03.100 --> 1:24:07.900
 be considered naivete is not necessarily

1:24:07.900 --> 1:24:18.340
 a lacking of maturity, but instead an obligation

1:24:18.340 --> 1:24:27.700
 to those older than us who have lived and seen too much

1:24:27.700 --> 1:24:34.500
 to fully believe in what is naive and right

1:24:34.500 --> 1:24:41.980
 without the assistance of the young

1:24:41.980 --> 1:24:46.580
 to reinspire traditional idealism.

1:24:46.580 --> 1:24:53.660
 And so perhaps instead of trying to be more mature all the time,

1:24:53.660 --> 1:24:59.740
 I should spend some time trying to be an idealistic form of hope

1:24:59.740 --> 1:25:04.220
 in the lives of people who maybe have seen too much

1:25:04.220 --> 1:25:07.660
 to retain all of that original hope.

1:25:07.660 --> 1:25:11.500
 So that's something that's difficult,

1:25:11.500 --> 1:25:15.100
 but especially appearing in public

1:25:15.100 --> 1:25:18.180
 as someone as young as I am, I think

1:25:18.180 --> 1:25:21.300
 anything I do, which is juvenile by choice,

1:25:21.300 --> 1:25:24.460
 will be held against me.

1:25:24.460 --> 1:25:26.980
 But maybe that's a sacrifice that I have to make.

1:25:26.980 --> 1:25:30.820
 I have to retain some sort of youthful hope and optimism.

1:25:30.820 --> 1:25:32.220
 Yeah, I can't.

1:25:32.220 --> 1:25:36.980
 I mean, I'm going to get teary eyed now, but I have allergies.

1:25:36.980 --> 1:25:39.100
 But also, this is pretty powerful what you're saying.

1:25:39.100 --> 1:25:40.420
 I certainly share your ideas.

1:25:40.420 --> 1:25:44.220
 It's something I struggle with just by instinct.

1:25:44.220 --> 1:25:46.340
 You should read The Idiot by Dostoevsky.

1:25:46.340 --> 1:25:52.420
 By instinct, I love being naive and seeing

1:25:52.420 --> 1:25:54.540
 the world from a hopeful perspective,

1:25:54.540 --> 1:25:56.460
 from an optimistic perspective.

1:25:56.460 --> 1:26:00.100
 And it's sad that that is something

1:26:00.100 --> 1:26:03.060
 you pay a price for in this world,

1:26:03.060 --> 1:26:06.700
 like in the academic world, especially as you're coming up

1:26:06.700 --> 1:26:07.940
 through schooling.

1:26:07.940 --> 1:26:10.740
 But just actually, it's a hit on your reputation

1:26:10.740 --> 1:26:12.180
 throughout your life.

1:26:12.180 --> 1:26:15.980
 And it's a sad truth, but you have to, for many things,

1:26:15.980 --> 1:26:19.140
 if it's a principle you hold, you

1:26:19.140 --> 1:26:21.780
 have to be willing to pay the costs.

1:26:21.780 --> 1:26:26.380
 And ultimately, I believe that in part,

1:26:26.380 --> 1:26:30.460
 a hopeful view will help you realize

1:26:30.460 --> 1:26:31.860
 the best version of yourself.

1:26:31.860 --> 1:26:37.740
 Because optimism is a kind of, optimism is productive.

1:26:37.740 --> 1:26:44.820
 Like believing that the world is and can be amazing

1:26:44.820 --> 1:26:47.340
 allows you to create a more amazing world somehow.

1:26:47.340 --> 1:26:51.020
 I mean, I'm not sure if it's the human nature

1:26:51.020 --> 1:26:52.500
 of a fundamental law of physics.

1:26:52.500 --> 1:26:53.060
 I don't know.

1:26:53.060 --> 1:26:55.100
 But believe in the impossible in the sense

1:26:55.100 --> 1:26:57.900
 being optimistic about the thing.

1:26:57.900 --> 1:27:00.900
 It's similar, going back to what you've said,

1:27:00.900 --> 1:27:03.920
 is believing that a radical, that a powerful single idea,

1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:09.700
 that a single individual can revolutionize some framework

1:27:09.700 --> 1:27:11.980
 that we're operating in that will change

1:27:11.980 --> 1:27:12.980
 the world for the better.

1:27:12.980 --> 1:27:16.140
 Believing that allows you to have the chance

1:27:16.140 --> 1:27:17.740
 to create that.

1:27:17.740 --> 1:27:19.860
 And so I'm with you on the optimism.

1:27:19.860 --> 1:27:23.500
 But you may have to pay a cost of optimism

1:27:23.500 --> 1:27:26.780
 and naive hopefulness.

1:27:26.780 --> 1:27:31.020
 I mean, in some sense, optimism limits freedom.

1:27:31.020 --> 1:27:36.180
 I think if we don't really have much choice in choosing

1:27:36.180 --> 1:27:41.620
 what is perfect, if it exists as an ideal,

1:27:41.620 --> 1:27:45.620
 then there isn't much room for creativity.

1:27:45.620 --> 1:27:47.580
 And that's a danger of optimism, is someone

1:27:47.580 --> 1:27:50.660
 who would like to be creative.

1:27:50.660 --> 1:27:54.260
 I think it was Warren Zeevon said,

1:27:54.260 --> 1:27:56.260
 accepting dreams, you're never really free.

1:27:56.260 --> 1:28:00.100
 And that's something I think about a lot.

1:28:00.100 --> 1:28:01.380
 He's an interesting guy, also.

1:28:01.380 --> 1:28:04.340
 I really like him.

1:28:04.340 --> 1:28:08.780
 On that topic, you do have a bit of an appreciation

1:28:08.780 --> 1:28:09.820
 and connection with music.

1:28:09.820 --> 1:28:11.620
 I saw you play some guitar a few months ago.

1:28:15.620 --> 1:28:18.540
 Can you put, in a philosophical sense,

1:28:18.540 --> 1:28:20.900
 your connection to music?

1:28:20.900 --> 1:28:24.180
 What insights about life, about just the way

1:28:24.180 --> 1:28:26.060
 you see the world, do you get from music?

1:28:26.060 --> 1:28:29.060
 I think the role music has played in my life

1:28:29.060 --> 1:28:33.140
 was originally motivated by wanting

1:28:33.140 --> 1:28:35.460
 to prove things to myself.

1:28:35.460 --> 1:28:37.540
 I really have no ear for music.

1:28:37.540 --> 1:28:41.100
 I have a terrible sense of pitch.

1:28:41.100 --> 1:28:43.420
 And I think a lot of music relies

1:28:43.420 --> 1:28:45.180
 on very standard teaching.

1:28:45.180 --> 1:28:50.300
 If you think about lessons, for example, music lessons,

1:28:50.300 --> 1:28:56.420
 there's a routine to them, which is so archaic and traditional

1:28:56.420 --> 1:28:59.300
 that there's no room for deviation.

1:28:59.300 --> 1:29:03.380
 I think all of that suggested to me

1:29:03.380 --> 1:29:06.380
 that I would never have a relationship with music.

1:29:06.380 --> 1:29:07.780
 I loved listening to music.

1:29:07.780 --> 1:29:09.740
 It was just difficult to me.

1:29:09.740 --> 1:29:12.780
 It saddened me.

1:29:12.780 --> 1:29:15.900
 I wanted to know if there was any way I could build

1:29:15.900 --> 1:29:22.700
 a connection to music, given who I am, my own idiosyncrasies,

1:29:22.700 --> 1:29:25.580
 what challenges I have.

1:29:25.580 --> 1:29:27.820
 I decided to try to learn music theory

1:29:27.820 --> 1:29:29.860
 before I touched an instrument.

1:29:32.780 --> 1:29:35.420
 I think that gave me a very unique opportunity instead

1:29:35.420 --> 1:29:38.860
 of spending my time fruitlessly at the beginning

1:29:38.860 --> 1:29:41.020
 on the syntax of a particular instrument.

1:29:41.020 --> 1:29:43.580
 This is how you, this is your posture on the piano.

1:29:43.580 --> 1:29:45.900
 This is how you hold your fingers.

1:29:45.900 --> 1:29:50.460
 I tried instead to learn what made music work.

1:29:50.460 --> 1:29:52.700
 And the wonderful thing about that

1:29:52.700 --> 1:29:56.940
 was I'm pretty sure that any instrument with discrete notes

1:29:56.940 --> 1:30:00.780
 is mine for the taking within a day or so of having

1:30:00.780 --> 1:30:03.100
 the ability to play with it.

1:30:03.100 --> 1:30:07.860
 So I think approaching music abstractly

1:30:07.860 --> 1:30:13.780
 gave me the ability to instantiate it everywhere.

1:30:13.780 --> 1:30:18.380
 And I think it also taught me something about self teaching.

1:30:18.380 --> 1:30:22.060
 Recently, I've tried getting into classical music

1:30:22.060 --> 1:30:24.860
 because, at least traditionally, this

1:30:24.860 --> 1:30:28.980
 is the thing which is thought to require the most

1:30:28.980 --> 1:30:35.460
 rigor and traditional teaching.

1:30:35.460 --> 1:30:37.860
 I think it's essentially taught me,

1:30:37.860 --> 1:30:41.540
 even if I'll never be a great classical performer,

1:30:41.540 --> 1:30:45.380
 that there is nothing one can't really

1:30:45.380 --> 1:30:48.340
 teach themself in this era.

1:30:48.340 --> 1:30:53.980
 So I've been enjoying whatever connection I have with music.

1:30:53.980 --> 1:30:56.140
 The other thing I'll say about it

1:30:56.140 --> 1:31:00.300
 is that it's a very rewarding learning process.

1:31:00.300 --> 1:31:07.300
 We know, for example, that music accesses our neurochemicals

1:31:07.300 --> 1:31:09.100
 very directly.

1:31:09.100 --> 1:31:14.340
 And if you teach yourself a little bit of theory

1:31:14.340 --> 1:31:19.220
 and are able to instantiate it on an instrument

1:31:19.220 --> 1:31:23.660
 without wasting your time or spending your time tediously

1:31:23.660 --> 1:31:28.020
 on learning the particulars of that instrument,

1:31:28.020 --> 1:31:32.300
 you can instantly sit down and access your own dopamine loops.

1:31:32.300 --> 1:31:35.940
 And so you don't really need to motivate yourself with music

1:31:35.940 --> 1:31:39.380
 because you're giving your brain drugs.

1:31:39.380 --> 1:31:43.980
 Who needs motivation to give themselves drugs?

1:31:43.980 --> 1:31:45.860
 And learn something.

1:31:45.860 --> 1:31:53.300
 So I think more people should be playing music.

1:31:53.300 --> 1:31:55.580
 I think a lot of people don't realize how easy it

1:31:55.580 --> 1:32:01.300
 can be to approach if you take a sort of unstandard approach.

1:32:01.300 --> 1:32:03.020
 And the unstandard approach in your sense

1:32:03.020 --> 1:32:05.060
 was understanding the theory first,

1:32:05.060 --> 1:32:08.500
 and then just from the foundation of the theory,

1:32:08.500 --> 1:32:12.980
 be able to then just take on any instrument

1:32:12.980 --> 1:32:17.820
 and start creating something that sounds reasonably good

1:32:17.820 --> 1:32:19.860
 or learning something that sounds reasonably good.

1:32:19.860 --> 1:32:23.860
 And then plugging into the, as you call them,

1:32:23.860 --> 1:32:26.460
 the dopamine loops of your brain,

1:32:26.460 --> 1:32:29.140
 allowing yourself to enjoy the process.

1:32:29.140 --> 1:32:34.220
 What about the pain in the ass rigorous process of practice?

1:32:34.220 --> 1:32:37.460
 So is there something about my dopamine loops, for example,

1:32:37.460 --> 1:32:40.340
 that enjoys doing the same thing over and over and over again

1:32:40.340 --> 1:32:42.380
 and watching myself improve?

1:32:42.380 --> 1:32:47.900
 I think that's because music is more effective at accessing us

1:32:47.900 --> 1:32:49.780
 when it's played correctly.

1:32:49.780 --> 1:32:53.860
 And I think you play, I'm positive that you play music

1:32:53.860 --> 1:32:56.060
 much more correctly than I do.

1:32:56.060 --> 1:32:59.340
 So if you are going to sit down and play something

1:32:59.340 --> 1:33:03.340
 that you've learned, that piece will be much more satisfying

1:33:03.340 --> 1:33:06.620
 to your ears and to your brain than if I

1:33:06.620 --> 1:33:08.660
 were to play that piece just sitting down

1:33:08.660 --> 1:33:11.220
 with an instrument.

1:33:11.220 --> 1:33:18.380
 But it's sort of a trade off with freedom and rigor

1:33:18.380 --> 1:33:22.900
 because even if I should be spending more of my time

1:33:22.900 --> 1:33:28.260
 practicing rigorously, I know I don't have to to make me happy.

1:33:28.260 --> 1:33:31.500
 Well, Jocko Willink, I think, has this saying

1:33:31.500 --> 1:33:33.580
 that discipline is freedom.

1:33:33.580 --> 1:33:39.500
 So maybe the repetition of the disciplined repetition

1:33:39.500 --> 1:33:42.940
 is actually one of the mechanisms of achieving freedom.

1:33:42.940 --> 1:33:45.380
 It's another way to get to freedom,

1:33:45.380 --> 1:33:47.660
 that it doesn't have to be a constraint,

1:33:47.660 --> 1:33:52.540
 but in a sense, unlocks greater sets of opportunity

1:33:52.540 --> 1:33:56.260
 than results in a deeper experience of freedom.

1:33:56.260 --> 1:33:56.900
 Maybe.

1:33:56.900 --> 1:34:01.340
 Particularly if you're thinking about discipline

1:34:01.340 --> 1:34:08.060
 and method for improvisation, there

1:34:08.060 --> 1:34:10.260
 are a million pieces that you could improvise

1:34:10.260 --> 1:34:14.140
 with the same discipline in how to approach

1:34:14.140 --> 1:34:16.180
 that improvisation.

1:34:16.180 --> 1:34:23.940
 So I think it's true that discipline promotes freedom

1:34:23.940 --> 1:34:28.740
 if you insert a layer of indirection.

1:34:28.740 --> 1:34:32.660
 Because I think if you're trying to learn

1:34:32.660 --> 1:34:35.820
 one piece that was written 400 years ago

1:34:35.820 --> 1:34:38.820
 and you're playing it over and over again,

1:34:38.820 --> 1:34:46.100
 there is nothing personal or creative about that process,

1:34:46.100 --> 1:34:49.660
 even if it's beautiful and satisfying.

1:34:49.660 --> 1:34:53.140
 There has to be some sort of discipline applied

1:34:53.140 --> 1:34:55.980
 to the creativity of self.

1:34:55.980 --> 1:35:01.540
 So I think that is the layer of indirection

1:35:01.540 --> 1:35:06.580
 which reconciles both approaches to freedom and discipline

1:35:06.580 --> 1:35:09.460
 and enjoyment of music.

1:35:09.460 --> 1:35:15.260
 Discipline applied to the creativity of self.

1:35:15.260 --> 1:35:16.460
 Damn, Zev.

1:35:16.460 --> 1:35:18.140
 Thank you.

1:35:18.140 --> 1:35:22.780
 Now, as an aging man yourself, if you

1:35:22.780 --> 1:35:26.580
 were to give advice to young folks today

1:35:26.580 --> 1:35:30.060
 of how to approach life and maybe advice to yourself,

1:35:30.060 --> 1:35:35.220
 is there some way you could condense a set of principles,

1:35:35.220 --> 1:35:38.780
 a set of advices you would give to yourself

1:35:38.780 --> 1:35:43.660
 and to other young folks of how to live life?

1:35:43.660 --> 1:35:44.140
 Sure.

1:35:44.140 --> 1:35:49.780
 I would say that with the collapse of systems

1:35:49.780 --> 1:35:55.380
 that have existed for thousands of years,

1:35:55.380 --> 1:35:57.700
 whatever is happening with universities

1:35:57.700 --> 1:36:00.700
 might be an example of some system that may or may not

1:36:00.700 --> 1:36:02.540
 be decaying.

1:36:02.540 --> 1:36:09.740
 I think with the destruction of important systems,

1:36:09.740 --> 1:36:15.620
 there is a unique opportunity to invest in oneself.

1:36:15.620 --> 1:36:19.580
 And I think that is always the right approach,

1:36:19.580 --> 1:36:23.540
 provided that the investment one makes in his self

1:36:23.540 --> 1:36:28.980
 is obligated towards humanity as a whole.

1:36:28.980 --> 1:36:36.140
 And I think that is the great struggle of my generation.

1:36:36.140 --> 1:36:38.700
 Will we create our own paths that

1:36:38.700 --> 1:36:42.500
 are capable of saving whatever is collapsing?

1:36:42.500 --> 1:36:46.500
 Or will we be squashed by the debris?

1:36:46.500 --> 1:36:52.620
 And I hope to articulate what patterns

1:36:52.620 --> 1:36:55.620
 I see this struggle taking over the years

1:36:55.620 --> 1:36:58.260
 that my generation becomes particularly

1:36:58.260 --> 1:37:02.660
 active in the world as an important force.

1:37:02.660 --> 1:37:06.300
 I think already we're important as a demographic

1:37:06.300 --> 1:37:07.380
 to particular markets.

1:37:07.380 --> 1:37:11.140
 But I should hope that our voices will matter as well,

1:37:11.140 --> 1:37:12.740
 starting very soon.

1:37:12.740 --> 1:37:16.180
 So I would try to think about that.

1:37:16.180 --> 1:37:19.340
 That would be my advice.

1:37:19.340 --> 1:37:21.500
 It's a silly question to ask, perhaps.

1:37:21.500 --> 1:37:25.100
 But a bit of a Russian one.

1:37:25.100 --> 1:37:28.460
 It's silly because you're young, but I

1:37:28.460 --> 1:37:31.740
 don't think it's actually silly because you're young.

1:37:31.740 --> 1:37:34.420
 Do you ponder your mortality?

1:37:34.420 --> 1:37:40.060
 And are you just afraid of death in general?

1:37:40.060 --> 1:37:46.220
 So tying us back to our previous conversations

1:37:46.220 --> 1:37:53.260
 about abstraction versus experience,

1:37:53.260 --> 1:37:59.140
 which is determining our notions of our life and our world,

1:37:59.140 --> 1:38:04.940
 death is interesting in that it is obviously hyper

1:38:04.940 --> 1:38:07.380
 important to a person's life.

1:38:07.380 --> 1:38:09.220
 And it is something that, for the most part,

1:38:09.220 --> 1:38:15.580
 no human will really experience and be able to reflect upon.

1:38:15.580 --> 1:38:20.420
 So our notions of death are sort of proof

1:38:20.420 --> 1:38:22.740
 that if we want to make the most of our lives,

1:38:22.740 --> 1:38:29.620
 we have to think abstractly and relying not at all at times

1:38:29.620 --> 1:38:37.100
 on experiential thought and understandings

1:38:37.100 --> 1:38:41.380
 because we can't really experience death and reflect

1:38:41.380 --> 1:38:43.540
 upon it hence and use it to motivate us.

1:38:43.540 --> 1:38:45.700
 It has to remain some sort of abstraction.

1:38:45.700 --> 1:38:53.220
 And I think if we have trouble comprehending true abstraction,

1:38:53.220 --> 1:38:58.380
 we tend to view ourselves as nearly immortal.

1:38:58.380 --> 1:39:00.340
 And I think that's very dangerous.

1:39:00.340 --> 1:39:07.020
 So one concrete implication for my belief in abstraction

1:39:07.020 --> 1:39:14.660
 would be that we all need to be aware of our own deaths.

1:39:14.660 --> 1:39:19.260
 And we need to understand concretely

1:39:19.260 --> 1:39:22.660
 the boundaries of our lifetimes.

1:39:22.660 --> 1:39:26.940
 And no amount of experience can really motivate that.

1:39:26.940 --> 1:39:31.780
 It has to be driven by thought and abstraction in theory.

1:39:31.780 --> 1:39:34.900
 That's one of the deepest elements

1:39:34.900 --> 1:39:36.780
 of what it means to be human is our ability

1:39:36.780 --> 1:39:41.260
 to form abstractions about our mortality versus animals.

1:39:41.260 --> 1:39:44.380
 I think there's just something really fundamental

1:39:44.380 --> 1:39:49.340
 about our interaction with the abstractions of death.

1:39:49.340 --> 1:39:54.340
 And there's a lot of philosophers

1:39:54.340 --> 1:39:59.860
 that say that that's actually core to everything

1:39:59.860 --> 1:40:03.860
 we create in this world, which is us struggling

1:40:03.860 --> 1:40:11.300
 with this impossible to understand idea of mortality.

1:40:11.300 --> 1:40:17.300
 I mean, I'm drawn to this idea because both the mystery of it

1:40:17.300 --> 1:40:19.700
 but also just from the human experience perspective,

1:40:19.700 --> 1:40:25.300
 it seems that you get a lot of meaning from stuff ending.

1:40:25.300 --> 1:40:27.100
 It's kind of sad the flip side of that

1:40:27.100 --> 1:40:31.700
 to think that stuff won't be as meaningful if it doesn't end,

1:40:31.700 --> 1:40:33.220
 if it's not finite.

1:40:33.220 --> 1:40:38.220
 But it seems like resources gain value from being finite.

1:40:38.220 --> 1:40:40.100
 And that's true for time.

1:40:40.100 --> 1:40:43.020
 That's true for the deliciousness of ice cream.

1:40:43.020 --> 1:40:46.700
 That's true for love, for everything, for music,

1:40:46.700 --> 1:40:47.380
 and so on.

1:40:47.380 --> 1:40:55.460
 And yeah, it seems deeply human to try to, as you said,

1:40:55.460 --> 1:40:58.140
 concretize the abstractions of mortality

1:40:58.140 --> 1:41:00.500
 even though we can never truly experience it

1:41:00.500 --> 1:41:02.460
 because that's the whole point of it.

1:41:02.460 --> 1:41:04.460
 Once it ends, you can't experience it.

1:41:04.460 --> 1:41:05.780
 Yeah.

1:41:05.780 --> 1:41:07.900
 Again, another ridiculous question.

1:41:07.900 --> 1:41:10.860
 OK.

1:41:10.860 --> 1:41:13.020
 What do you think is the meaning of it all?

1:41:13.020 --> 1:41:14.900
 What's the meaning of life?

1:41:14.900 --> 1:41:20.700
 From your deep thinking about this world,

1:41:20.700 --> 1:41:22.660
 is there a good way to answer any

1:41:22.660 --> 1:41:26.620
 of the why questions about this existence here on Earth?

1:41:26.620 --> 1:41:28.860
 And as I said, we're here in part by principle

1:41:28.860 --> 1:41:30.980
 and in part by accident.

1:41:30.980 --> 1:41:36.180
 And a lot of the things which bring us joy

1:41:36.180 --> 1:41:39.300
 are programmed to bring us joy to ensure

1:41:39.300 --> 1:41:42.300
 our evolutionary success.

1:41:42.300 --> 1:41:51.060
 And so I would not necessarily consider

1:41:51.060 --> 1:41:57.260
 all of the things which bring us joy to be meaningful.

1:41:57.260 --> 1:42:03.180
 I think they play a very obvious role and a clear pattern,

1:42:03.180 --> 1:42:06.140
 and we don't have much choice in that.

1:42:06.140 --> 1:42:10.980
 I think that outrules the idea of joy

1:42:10.980 --> 1:42:13.020
 being the meaning of life.

1:42:13.020 --> 1:42:19.900
 I think it's a nice thing we get to have,

1:42:19.900 --> 1:42:22.340
 even if it's not inherently meaningful.

1:42:22.340 --> 1:42:36.620
 I think the most wonderful thing that we have ever been given

1:42:36.620 --> 1:42:42.180
 has been our ability to, as I said,

1:42:42.180 --> 1:42:47.860
 observe what transcends us as humans.

1:42:47.860 --> 1:42:52.060
 And I think to live a meaningful life is to see that

1:42:52.060 --> 1:42:56.180
 and hopefully contribute to that.

1:42:56.180 --> 1:42:58.900
 So to try to understand what makes us human

1:42:58.900 --> 1:43:03.540
 and to transcend that and in some small way contribute to it

1:43:03.540 --> 1:43:05.500
 in the finite time we have here.

1:43:08.380 --> 1:43:08.860
 Yeah.

1:43:11.780 --> 1:43:13.220
 Those are some powerful words.

1:43:13.220 --> 1:43:13.740
 Thank you.

1:43:13.740 --> 1:43:15.980
 You're a truly special human being.

1:43:15.980 --> 1:43:17.620
 It's really an honor to talk to you.

1:43:17.620 --> 1:43:23.180
 I can't, I'm just, I'm a newborn fan of yours

1:43:23.180 --> 1:43:25.540
 and I can't wait to see how you push the world.

1:43:25.540 --> 1:43:30.420
 Please embrace the fear you feel and be bold.

1:43:30.420 --> 1:43:34.980
 And I think you will do some special things in this world.

1:43:34.980 --> 1:43:37.620
 I'm confident if the world doesn't destroy you

1:43:37.620 --> 1:43:38.660
 and I hope it doesn't.

1:43:38.660 --> 1:43:41.300
 Be strong, be brave.

1:43:41.300 --> 1:43:42.580
 You're an inspiration.

1:43:42.580 --> 1:43:44.220
 Keep doing your thing.

1:43:44.220 --> 1:43:46.060
 And thanks for talking today.

1:43:46.060 --> 1:43:48.500
