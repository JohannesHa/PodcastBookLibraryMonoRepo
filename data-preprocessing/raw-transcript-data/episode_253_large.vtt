 Уважаемые дамы и господа! The following is a conversation with Michael Malice, his fifth time on this, the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:09.680 --> 00:12.920
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:12.920 --> 00:22.920
 And now, here's my New Year's Eve 2021 conversation with the one and only, Mr. Michael Malice.

00:22.920 --> 00:24.080
 Привет, товарищ!

00:24.080 --> 00:25.080
 С Новым годом!

00:25.080 --> 00:26.760
 С Новым годом!

00:26.760 --> 00:36.200
 Dostoevsky wrote in The Idiot, my favorite of his books, through the main character, Prince Mishkin, that beauty will save the world.

00:36.200 --> 00:46.640
 Красота спасет мир. These words, seemingly naive, and ultimately, at least to me, profound. What do they mean to you? Beauty will save the world.

00:46.640 --> 00:50.280
 Naive? Really? I don't think they seem naive at all.

00:50.280 --> 01:00.240
 Well, Solzhenitsyn actually, for his 1970 Nobel Prize speech, talked about this line a lot, and he thought, for most of his life, that was a silly line.

01:00.240 --> 01:07.520
 It was just words thrown out there, because with all the suffering that's in the world, what has beauty actually ever done?

01:07.520 --> 01:09.240
 Oh my God, I hate this so much.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.760
 Talking trash about Solzhenitsyn.

01:11.760 --> 01:12.440
 Yeah, I am.

01:12.440 --> 01:12.960
 Okay.

01:12.960 --> 01:21.040
 And this perfectly sets up this theme, you know, I said, let's do this episode, start the new year on a positive note, give people hope, give people joy.

01:21.040 --> 01:29.440
 You and I both have friends who are models, right? And it's a silly profession, to some extent, of course.

01:29.440 --> 01:33.960
 You are actually a model. You are my friend.

01:33.960 --> 01:55.280
 Yeah, that's right. That's true. I am a model. I was trying to be subtle. But for those people who actually deserve to be models, when you look at someone who is a model, and in some of their photos, and these people look perfect, now in real life, they're not perfect, they have flaws, they'll be the first to admit it, so on and so forth.

01:55.280 --> 02:18.360
 But when you look at beauty, it is almost impossible to maintain a sense of cynicism and hopelessness. Because if there's even one moment when some element of perfection has been actualized, if there's one moment where a beauty has been realized and captured, you can't say, well, it's never gonna happen again.

02:18.360 --> 02:42.600
 So I think beauty, it means hope. I think I hate that cynical idea of like, I get, I appreciate Solzhenitsyn's broader point that a lot of times people, there's something called a deepity, where people throw words together to sound profound. And if you take it apart, like this is just complete gibberish, I don't think this is an example of that.

02:42.600 --> 03:07.560
 I think beauty inspires. And more importantly, it proves to you, this is something that can actually happen on this Earth. Plato, right, the Platonic theory of forms, like this world is imperfect, but these perfect forms exist in another dimension. And that's where our concepts come from. He was an early person trying to figure out where our concepts come from, and epistemology, and so on and so forth.

03:07.560 --> 03:23.400
 But that is something that is real in here. So I completely disagree with his analysis of that. And I don't know if it'll save the world, but it's certainly a prerequisite. And what's the point of fighting for your values if you don't want to make the world a more beautiful place?

03:23.400 --> 03:40.680
 Well, it's also how you define beauty, because beauty could be just aesthetic, beauty could be art. Of course, art could encompass a lot more than just literature and paintings. It can encompass the full life, the full dance of life.

03:40.680 --> 04:03.960
 But then beauty could be something just deeper, like whatever that awe you feel when you pause and hear the music, just hear and look up at the stars. For some reason, when I see rockets go up, for me, it's like science. What is that? The awe that we're able to accomplish that as humans.

04:03.960 --> 04:23.320
 That's funny because there's lots of different schools of thought, like these people versus these people, and maybe vegans versus steakhouse people. I think in terms of the sciences, and I guess you and I would be on opposite sides here, you have the astronomy people versus the zoology people.

04:23.320 --> 04:41.560
 The big question is, would you rather spend 10 minutes on the moon or would you rather spend 10 minutes in the deep sea? And for me, it's clearly the deep sea. The zoology that's down there, there's something I would encourage people to look up called Deepstaria, which is a jellyfish.

04:41.560 --> 05:04.360
 And what's amazing when you watch these deep sea dives on YouTube is that the scientists, they're nature dorks like everybody else. They went into this field, and there's none of this maybe soldier nation style cynicism of when they see an amazing animal in its natural environment exhibiting these crazy behaviors, they lose it.

05:04.360 --> 05:13.160
 They're on the mics like, oh my god. It's so exciting to watch. I'm not a rocket person, but I'm definitely a zoology person.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.160
 So animals and plants and the sea.

05:15.160 --> 05:27.800
 And also, it's so mathematical. There's so many forms. There's this plant called Areospermum titanopsoides. I don't know how to pronounce it because they're always in Latin. You never hear them pronounced.

05:27.800 --> 05:28.600
 You said sperm.

05:28.600 --> 05:42.200
 Areospermum, yeah, because it's a woolly seed is the genus. The leaf, it just always puts out one leaf, but the leaf is covered in little magnifying lenses to make it maximize the sunlight.

05:42.200 --> 05:53.000
 So it looks like this little crystal seashell. It's tiny. It's like two centimeters, but it's just this amazing thing that grows out of the sands in South Africa.

05:53.000 --> 06:01.400
 Just to defend Solzhenitsyn for a second. So if I may read a couple of his lines from the speech. So he said, one day, that's how he introduces it.

06:01.400 --> 06:08.360
 One day, Dostoevsky threw out the enigmatic remark, beauty will save the world. What sort of a statement is that?

06:08.360 --> 06:19.080
 For a long time, I considered it mere words. How could that be possible? When in bloodthirsty history did beauty ever save anyone from anything?

06:19.080 --> 06:25.560
 And then later, he goes on to argue with himself in the speech as an older, wiser man now.

06:25.560 --> 06:31.240
 But perhaps that ancient trinity of truth, goodness and beauty is not simply an empty,

06:31.240 --> 06:36.760
 faded formula as we thought in the days of our self confident, materialistic youth.

06:36.760 --> 06:42.920
 If the tops of these three trees converge as the scholars maintained, but the two blatant,

06:42.920 --> 06:49.240
 two direct stems of truth and goodness are crushed, cut down, not allowed through, then perhaps the

06:49.240 --> 06:56.920
 fantastic, unpredictable, unexpected stems of beauty will push through and soar to that very same place.

06:56.920 --> 07:02.520
 And in so doing, will fulfill the work of all three. In that case, Dostoevsky's remark,

07:02.520 --> 07:08.200
 beauty will save the world, was not a careless phrase, but a prophecy.

07:08.200 --> 07:14.520
 Which of these three things are your favorites? Truth, goodness or beauty?

07:14.520 --> 07:22.520
 What do you call truth and goodness? The blatant, two direct stems of truth and goodness

07:22.520 --> 07:29.640
 versus the fantastic, unpredictable, unexpected stems of beauty, which is how I see your Twitter account.

07:29.640 --> 07:34.040
 I don't think that, I think there's a certain dearth of beauty to be had in my Twitter account, that's for sure.

07:34.040 --> 07:41.400
 It's certainly no goodness. Or truth. Yeah, yeah. It's Twitter, there's no truth to be found.

07:41.400 --> 07:47.960
 I will answer the question, I will of course point out that having this kind of,

07:47.960 --> 07:52.200
 you know, distinction between the three things is I think kind of synthetic. I think they very

07:52.200 --> 07:56.280
 heavily overlap. If not, if I could probably make the argument they're synonymous.

07:56.280 --> 08:01.880
 In fact, I do believe that they're largely synonymous.

08:01.880 --> 08:08.440
 Goodness. That's such an interesting word, goodness. Which of those three is my favorite?

08:08.440 --> 08:18.440
 I think truth is overrated in the sense that if something is a good story,

08:18.440 --> 08:26.040
 the story doesn't have to be true or real in order to motivate you and move you.

08:26.040 --> 08:34.600
 A lot of times, we can delude ourselves about somebody and that might actually serve a purpose

08:34.600 --> 08:39.320
 to some extent. You know, if you have someone who's maybe a family member and you kind of

08:39.320 --> 08:45.480
 ignore bad things that they do, there might be a reason for that. Of the three which is

08:45.480 --> 08:52.040
 most important, I think I would say probably goodness. I would say of the three the most

08:52.040 --> 08:58.600
 important is goodness because if you don't appreciate goodness, then beauty is just

08:58.600 --> 09:06.760
 empty. It's just a picture or it's nice. Bad people appreciate beauty. You know,

09:06.760 --> 09:10.920
 bad people are often, you know, seductive or have a beauty about them.

09:10.920 --> 09:16.680
 And in terms of action, I think it takes a lot of skill and work to create beauty or

09:16.680 --> 09:25.000
 to create truth or to express truth or express beauty. But I think goodness is like the easiest

09:25.000 --> 09:28.600
 default state of being, just being good to others.

09:29.240 --> 09:35.400
 Yeah, like, you know, like there'll be things where these videos where like one dog is drowning

09:35.400 --> 09:42.360
 and like another dog jumps in and saves it from the pool. Like that to me is just really amazing

09:42.360 --> 09:50.600
 stuff and is very moving. So just to me, goodness means integrity and it means kindness.

09:53.240 --> 09:56.200
 And yeah, I think of the three, that's the one I pick.

09:57.480 --> 10:01.880
 And I think people, sorry to interrupt, I think people also have this idea which is inculcated

10:01.880 --> 10:07.640
 to them, especially by corporate America, that as you get older, it's okay to do the

10:07.640 --> 10:12.520
 wrong thing sometimes, blah, blah, blah, blah. I don't buy that. And so I think goodness gets

10:12.520 --> 10:17.640
 rarer and rarer. And I think people know better and they tell themselves lies.

10:18.200 --> 10:26.920
 Yeah. But once you get, allow yourself the chance to just be good, I think it makes for a better

10:26.920 --> 10:31.560
 life. It's like it's not that much work. Like it's not like going to the gym or working out,

10:31.560 --> 10:37.400
 that's a lot of work and it's great afterwards. But like goodness is easy once you get into the habit

10:37.400 --> 10:41.400
 of it. I suppose working out is the same way. There's a lot of stuff. If you make it a habit,

10:43.000 --> 10:46.360
 you're going to get the rewards of it and it's going to be easy.

10:46.360 --> 10:50.280
 The rewards of goodness I think are more immediate than the rewards of working out.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.080
 As opposed to the hard drugs.

10:53.080 --> 10:53.720
 Yeah.

10:53.720 --> 10:57.560
 If, you mentioned this quote on one of your live streams, I think,

10:57.560 --> 10:59.720
 if you save one life, you save the world.

10:59.720 --> 10:59.880
 Yeah.

11:01.480 --> 11:06.360
 That's such a cool line. I think I remember reading about Paul Farmer. I think his name is,

11:06.360 --> 11:11.880
 he's a doctor that really, I mean, doctors in general, they kind of don't care about

11:13.560 --> 11:20.040
 like what they're doing as a broad policy across hundreds of thousands of millions of people.

11:20.040 --> 11:24.040
 They just care about the human in front of them, which is so interesting. They don't care it's

11:24.040 --> 11:30.920
 going to cost, like in his case to save one child, it will cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars.

11:30.920 --> 11:37.400
 They don't care about that. They know very well that their actions cannot be scaled,

11:38.120 --> 11:42.680
 but they can't help but help the child in front of them. And it's so interesting.

11:44.440 --> 11:49.000
 That's such an interesting way to live. And that's the way I kind of think when I try to do

11:49.000 --> 11:58.440
 something positive is, will this help one person? And I just kind of imagine a specific person,

11:58.440 --> 12:02.600
 depending on the thing that that would help with, like when I'm trying to create something,

12:02.600 --> 12:06.280
 whether it's a piece of hardware or a video or anything like that,

12:06.280 --> 12:09.000
 or educational material, lecture, that kind of stuff.

12:10.520 --> 12:15.960
 I don't know. What do you think about this quote? Like what is it profound or just poetic?

12:15.960 --> 12:20.040
 I think it's more profound than it sounds at first. The example I think of is Michelle

12:20.040 --> 12:24.520
 Bachmann. She was a former Congresswoman from Minnesota. She clearly had crazy eyes,

12:24.520 --> 12:29.880
 something was going on with her husband. But she adopted like 20 kids. Terry Shappert is

12:29.880 --> 12:34.200
 another friend of mine. He's like either Navy SEAL or Marines. Whatever it is, Terry,

12:34.200 --> 12:41.480
 I apologize. I'm not trying to be funny. And he adopts elder dogs. So going back to Bachmann,

12:41.480 --> 12:45.240
 it's like, yeah, you can say she's crazy. You can make fun of her politics all you want,

12:45.240 --> 12:51.080
 and all that stuff's legitimate. But if you save a kid, give them a home, and you save them from

12:51.080 --> 12:55.880
 the foster system, and you put a roof over their heads and make them feel loved and appreciated,

12:55.880 --> 13:02.200
 it's really hard for me to sit here and call you like a totally bad person.

13:02.200 --> 13:08.920
 I think that kind of thing is... Nick Cersei is another one. He adopted a kid. And I said,

13:08.920 --> 13:15.480
 I think you're a hero. One of the things that's very hard for me in writing, as you know,

13:15.480 --> 13:20.920
 I talk about this endlessly in this book, The White Pill, but writing about when people do

13:20.920 --> 13:26.440
 hurtful things to children, it really is hard to watch. And it's hard to... Because when you're an

13:26.440 --> 13:30.280
 author, you have to kind of empathize with the character. Where's this character coming from?

13:30.280 --> 13:34.200
 Explain their point of view. And that's the one that's the hardest for me to wrap my head around.

13:34.760 --> 13:35.960
 Cruelty to children.

13:35.960 --> 13:43.080
 Yeah. And yeah, sadism to children. It's just like, this is something even animals know not

13:43.080 --> 13:46.360
 to do. Do you know what I mean? Dogs, when you see them around kids, they're very

13:47.000 --> 13:50.760
 protective. If the kid pokes their eyes out, the dog doesn't do anything.

13:50.760 --> 13:56.600
 So it's like, if you can't even get to that level, what kind of person are you? So I think that quote

13:59.160 --> 14:04.840
 is a profound one, and it's an important one. It also means we're not all called upon to be

14:04.840 --> 14:11.880
 Superman. You only have very finite ability to move the needle. But at the same time,

14:12.440 --> 14:18.440
 if you have actually saved the life, you can go to meet your maker. You did your part. You left

14:18.440 --> 14:21.320
 the world a little bit better than you found it. And that's all you could ask anybody.

14:21.880 --> 14:28.600
 Also, I think from a policy perspective, it seems we just do better when we focus on doing a small

14:28.600 --> 14:34.040
 thing, helping one person. Because it feels like when you start talking about communism and all

14:34.040 --> 14:38.600
 those kinds of things, when you start to believe you could do good by a lot of people, that's where

14:38.600 --> 14:44.440
 your mind somehow stops being able to do good by a lot of people. That's when you start to think

14:44.440 --> 14:51.400
 about utopias and somehow utopias goes to feeds power into the brain to where it deludes you

14:51.400 --> 14:56.600
 completely. And then you start, it's okay to crack a few eggs to make an omelette kind of reasoning

14:56.600 --> 15:01.800
 and you run into trouble. It seems like it's much better even when you have the power and the money

15:01.800 --> 15:08.120
 and so on to achieve scale, to focus on one and then... Or locally, yeah. Locally, yeah.

15:08.840 --> 15:13.640
 Because then also you have the feedback. Right. So if you have some kind of program in Austin or

15:13.640 --> 15:17.320
 Brooklyn or something like that, and you can watch, oh, this is working, this isn't working,

15:17.320 --> 15:22.760
 then you could port it out to other places. But top down helping is at the very least,

15:22.760 --> 15:27.160
 it's going to be inefficient. And also I think it's a lot more useful when you're helping people

15:27.160 --> 15:31.960
 when it's a one on one relationship because then it's less, I don't know, embarrassing,

15:31.960 --> 15:36.840
 but certainly less something to receive help. And you also feel it's one thing if you get a check

15:36.840 --> 15:40.760
 from the government, food stamps, it's nothing if someone's like, hey, I'm going to buy your

15:40.760 --> 15:44.760
 groceries until you get back on your feet. You have this kind of motivation, I think for most

15:44.760 --> 15:50.120
 people to be like, you know what? This person believed in me. I'm going to make it worth their

15:50.120 --> 15:55.800
 while that they believed in me because I didn't believe in me. When I was giving lectures at MIT,

15:55.800 --> 16:01.320
 there was one, it was scared shitless. And I mean, everybody, you know how students are and all that

16:01.320 --> 16:06.680
 kind of stuff. They're kind of bored and they don't understand that you're human too. Yeah.

16:06.680 --> 16:13.640
 Or this could be just me. They don't understand you're trying to pass as human.

16:13.640 --> 16:20.680
 Yeah. But there's one gentleman in the audience and he went to all the lectures, all the gentlemen,

16:20.680 --> 16:28.520
 he was a faculty at MIT. And he just, without very kind of nonchalant, just said, after the lectures,

16:28.520 --> 16:35.000
 he would kind of nod at me and say, you did great. And before, like one time he said,

16:35.000 --> 16:40.440
 in a non creepy way, I know this is going to come off as creepy. He said, you look great today.

16:41.640 --> 16:51.320
 He said that in the way, so he's like 60, 70, whatever. I don't know. It's in a wise sage way,

16:51.320 --> 16:55.880
 because I was wearing a suit and tie. I look like, when you dress up like a young kid,

16:55.880 --> 17:02.520
 you dress them up for school. So he was just like, all right, you're all dressed up. You're

17:02.520 --> 17:08.040
 looking great. You got this. I don't know. That has a lasting impact, that kind of pat on the back.

17:08.040 --> 17:15.160
 But I agree with you. Cruelty towards other adults is somehow understandable,

17:16.120 --> 17:22.840
 because it's a world full of conflict, but cruelty towards children doesn't,

17:24.360 --> 17:31.960
 it doesn't quite, I can't understand it. I can't understand how you could act in a way that directly

17:31.960 --> 17:39.000
 causes suffering to a child in front of you. I don't think I've ever talked to you,

17:39.000 --> 17:44.200
 this might be a good time to ask you about this. What do you make, what lessons do you draw about

17:44.200 --> 17:51.720
 human civilization from Jeffrey Epstein, from just laying out? Everybody thinks about different

17:51.720 --> 17:58.520
 things. When you talk to Eric Weinstein, he thinks about intelligence and Jeffrey Epstein

17:58.520 --> 18:05.080
 is a front for something else. That's what he thinks about. I think about the weakness of grown

18:06.200 --> 18:12.520
 men in the face of charismatic evil, which is like, for me directly, is MIT. I didn't know.

18:12.520 --> 18:17.480
 I actually was, I guess I was at MIT when Jeffrey Epstein was just at the very end.

18:17.480 --> 18:25.000
 He must have been there. I didn't know any of this, but it really bothers me that nobody was able to

18:25.000 --> 18:30.840
 see through this man because he's obviously, what is also obvious to me is that he was very

18:30.840 --> 18:41.720
 charismatic. I try to think about human nature from this perspective is directly, like we said,

18:41.720 --> 18:50.360
 help one life. Would I know a Jeffrey Epstein if he was in my life? Would I know evil when I saw

18:50.360 --> 18:58.680
 evil? Even if it's sitting across from you. Exactly. The evil laugh. Thank you.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.160
 It's a Necronomicon.

19:07.240 --> 19:12.040
 I'm sure we'll talk about it. Maybe not. It doesn't really matter. We see things, you and I,

19:12.040 --> 19:17.000
 Michael, very differently about a lot of things politically and so on. The reason I like you a

19:17.000 --> 19:23.800
 lot, the reason I like the people I do in my life is there's a warmth, there's a kindness,

19:23.800 --> 19:29.960
 there's a humanity underneath it all. I don't really care what you believe. I don't care what

19:29.960 --> 19:35.080
 your Twitter says. It's easy to mistake your Twitter to indicate that there's not a deeply

19:35.080 --> 19:42.840
 human love for humanity in there. And that's why I'm detecting that. I think I would be able to

19:42.840 --> 19:48.280
 detect that Jeffrey Epstein. If you say detect, I'm just imagining the T1000 sketch. Yeah.

19:48.280 --> 19:59.560
 Detected. Yes. I imagine, I hope I would be able to not detect that Epstein lacks that completely.

19:59.560 --> 20:06.840
 Even if he's charismatic in the humor he has, even if he is charismatic in the expression of

20:06.840 --> 20:15.080
 curiosity for science, which he did. He was curious about not just boring minutia of science.

20:15.080 --> 20:19.800
 He was interested about the big questions in science, which I could see that become exciting

20:19.800 --> 20:25.000
 to scientists. Like, oh wow, here's a person who's thinking big. That's always exciting.

20:25.000 --> 20:31.160
 When somebody goes into a room and thinks about how do we solve intelligence? How do we travel

20:31.160 --> 20:35.800
 faster than the speed of light? That's exciting to people, especially people with money because

20:35.800 --> 20:41.080
 it's like, all right, so we might be able to actually do big things here. But you could see

20:41.080 --> 20:48.680
 through the bullshit, the deadness in the eyes. I don't know. So I think about that because I feel

20:48.680 --> 20:54.760
 like I have the responsibility for me as an individual to detect evil. So I, do you know

20:54.760 --> 21:00.040
 who Michael Allig is? Okay. This is going to be a whole long, this is going to be on Lex Clips,

21:00.040 --> 21:04.520
 but this is a whole long story. So there was a scene in New York in the nineties called the

21:04.520 --> 21:09.560
 Club Kids. And they would go out to different nightclubs at night. They would all dress in

21:09.560 --> 21:17.160
 really kind of crazy costumes. And the costumes were all like goofy and like just like an angel.

21:17.160 --> 21:21.640
 This was dressed like a nurse. There was a juvenile aspect to it. They're all taking,

21:21.640 --> 21:27.640
 you know, ketamine and ecstasy to all hours. This is kind of, rape culture was coming up in there.

21:27.640 --> 21:34.680
 And ahead of it, and in fact, there's a clip on YouTube. I think it was the Jane Whitney show

21:34.680 --> 21:40.120
 of the Club Kids and Gigi Allen. Gigi Allen is a, you know, kind of punk rock performer,

21:40.120 --> 21:46.920
 hard rock performer who passed away. And the audience and Gigi Allen was very aggressive and

21:46.920 --> 21:52.840
 like a crazy person. My friend once saw him in a concert and he took a dump on stage,

21:53.400 --> 21:57.400
 smeared it all over his face, grabbed the girl from the audience, gave her a big kiss.

21:57.400 --> 22:02.440
 And as she walked by him, she just went like this, like, excuse me, like went to the bathroom.

22:02.440 --> 22:06.600
 So the audience is screaming at Gigi Allen because he's very visibly over the top.

22:06.600 --> 22:10.520
 Whereas you got a bunch of these kids dressed in these silly costumes, you guys just having fun.

22:10.520 --> 22:14.680
 Well, the head of the Club Kids, Michael Allig, ended up killing someone. There was a kid called

22:14.680 --> 22:18.680
 Angel Menendez who hung around with them. He would always have angel wings and boots.

22:19.560 --> 22:27.160
 One time they're at Michael's condo with another drug dealer named Freeze. They got into a fight.

22:27.160 --> 22:31.560
 So Angel got hit in the head with a hammer. They kill him. What are we going to do with the body?

22:32.360 --> 22:36.840
 They put it on ice in the bathtub. They had a party. So everyone's going to the bathroom while

22:36.840 --> 22:41.000
 Angel's body's there. Michael got, they're like, all right, we got to take care of this. Michael

22:41.000 --> 22:48.040
 got extremely high in heroin, had like a cutlery from Macy's, saw the body in pieces, put it in a

22:48.040 --> 22:52.760
 box. They took him in a cab. The cab driver helped them throw the body into the river.

22:52.760 --> 22:57.320
 And then Michael starts walking around Manhattan wearing Angel's boots and would tell people,

22:57.320 --> 23:02.120
 oh, I killed Angel. Now, because he was a super effeminate, over the top, like he would pee in

23:02.120 --> 23:06.520
 people's beer kind of guy, everyone's like, oh God, Michael, like you and your stupid pranks.

23:07.480 --> 23:15.320
 But it was true. And he got caught and he got sentenced to jail. So I was in a store in Manhattan

23:15.320 --> 23:19.240
 in Soho. And it was one of those stores where you have like all sorts of things for sale.

23:19.240 --> 23:24.280
 And I saw a painting and it said Malice. And I'm like, wait, what? And it was M. Allig. It was a

23:24.280 --> 23:28.200
 Michael Allig painting. He had painted while in jail. So my mom bought it for me for my birthday.

23:28.200 --> 23:32.440
 I don't remember what birthday it was. And I started writing to him in prison. He was going

23:32.440 --> 23:37.800
 to write a memoir called Aligula, which is clever. And then I actually went to visit him. I'm like,

23:37.800 --> 23:41.960
 I want to see what this person's like. Because on one hand, he's king of New York nightlife,

23:41.960 --> 23:46.680
 this goofy person. And it's also kind of ironic that G.G. Allen is like, maybe he's gross. He's

23:46.680 --> 23:49.800
 not killing anybody. He's probably an accountant off the stage. And Michael Allig actually did

23:49.800 --> 23:56.440
 kill someone and then bragged about it, tongue in cheek. But meeting him, he passed away last

23:56.440 --> 24:07.480
 December, on Christmas actually, on Christmas 2020. He was clearly a sociopath. And I'd never

24:07.480 --> 24:12.520
 met a sociopath before. Now, a lot of times you'll read these, you'll take a BuzzFeed quiz, like,

24:12.520 --> 24:17.880
 are you a sociopath? And it's like, oh, my feelings weren't hurt when I was mean to someone. It's not

24:17.880 --> 24:25.400
 a thin line between me and you and him. It's a thick, thick line. Because when you're talking

24:25.400 --> 24:30.040
 to someone like that, at least in this specific case, he was being very friendly. And it's not

24:30.040 --> 24:36.200
 like he was going to kill anyone or as a threat to me. But there's that sense like something's

24:36.200 --> 24:43.320
 really off here. And he was talking to me about how after he had killed Angel, he would just talk

24:43.320 --> 24:48.760
 about it because he felt so much guilt. He just wanted to get caught. It's like, no, no, no. What

24:48.760 --> 24:54.040
 he was describing wasn't guilt. He was describing just he didn't like the knife over his head,

24:54.600 --> 24:58.200
 like waiting to get caught. I'm like, you don't even know what guilt is? So it was kind of like,

24:58.200 --> 25:07.400
 oh, wow. But the thing is Michael Allig was in a very low social position. And the thing is when

25:07.400 --> 25:16.280
 someone is powerful, very high status, and they do something, we are as kind of hierarchical animals,

25:16.280 --> 25:22.360
 we kind of defer to their norms. So if you're at a party with, let's suppose,

25:23.160 --> 25:27.800
 either of us, and it's like a Jeffrey Epstein party, and everyone at the party is doing some

25:27.800 --> 25:33.080
 sort of weird drug we've never heard of, we wouldn't really feel comfortable judging them

25:33.640 --> 25:41.080
 because like their norms kind of become the norm for that space. The lesson for me about Jeffrey

25:41.080 --> 25:48.280
 Epstein, there's a lot of them because I think to me, the biggest moment was the Amy Rohrbach

25:48.280 --> 25:54.280
 situation. Amy Rohrbach was caught on a hot mic saying that they had all the goods on him,

25:54.280 --> 25:59.560
 they had all the names, and that Buckingham Palace called them, they killed the story because they

25:59.560 --> 26:06.440
 weren't going to get a Meghan Markle interview out of it. So that, the willingness of those in power

26:06.440 --> 26:13.640
 to do the wrong thing for the flimsiest pretext, I think was a big important lesson. Also the fact

26:13.640 --> 26:20.920
 that no one at ABC had any consequences for this. In fact, the only person who got in trouble for

26:20.920 --> 26:26.760
 all this was someone who used to work at ABC, went to I believe CBS, and they got fired from CBS

26:26.760 --> 26:29.880
 because apparently they had access to footage at one point, even though they weren't the ones who

26:29.880 --> 26:37.720
 had leaked it. So whistleblowers are like the only, for example, the case in Eric Garner,

26:37.720 --> 26:43.480
 the guy who was selling Lucy cigarettes in New York City, who was arrested, he had a heart

26:43.480 --> 26:49.320
 attack or whatever it was on the way to jail, he died. So the cops had a situation, the only person

26:49.320 --> 26:55.480
 who had gotten in trouble because of that was the guy filming it, he went to jail. So I think there's

26:55.480 --> 27:02.200
 a lesson in terms of, look at Julian Assange, right? There's a huge amount of power exercised

27:02.200 --> 27:07.720
 by elites to make sure that what is done on the cover of darkness remains on the cover of darkness.

27:07.720 --> 27:12.360
 And also Kevin McCarthy, who was currently the House Minority Leader, leader of the Republicans,

27:12.360 --> 27:18.680
 he wrote a letter to ABC News, like, you had this guy, maybe you couldn't call in the authorities,

27:18.680 --> 27:22.520
 but you could have leaked it to somebody, why hasn't anything come forward? Nothing happened

27:22.520 --> 27:27.000
 as a result of this. We also have to keep in mind that the longest serving Republican Speaker of

27:27.000 --> 27:30.840
 the House in history, Dennis Hastert, went to jail because of things related to pedophilia and things

27:30.840 --> 27:37.720
 like that. So as Russians, and this is something I think you and I have mentioned before, Americans

27:37.720 --> 27:44.200
 are very naive, often decreasingly so, about the nature of evil. They think an evil person is

27:44.200 --> 27:50.520
 someone who's getting kickbacks or the Cuomos are colluding, something like that. I would hardly even

27:50.520 --> 27:57.240
 call that evil. No, no, this is the sort of things that are so depraved that you would never think

27:57.240 --> 28:01.560
 about it in a million years in your own home. You don't think in these terms. And I think they get

28:01.560 --> 28:07.560
 off on doing things that if the average person heard about it, the average person would be shocked

28:07.560 --> 28:10.600
 because that gives them this sense of we're above them, we're different from them.

28:10.600 --> 28:14.920
 The rules don't apply to us. There's a lot to say here. So what is the norm thing you said

28:14.920 --> 28:21.000
 at a party? It's really interesting for an NR cast to say that. Well, no, it's this. No, well,

28:21.000 --> 28:25.960
 I know, I know. I'm not, sorry, that came off as criticism. I meant it as harsh criticism.

28:28.600 --> 28:38.120
 No, I think about that a lot. I found myself in situations where I'm invited to these kinds of

28:38.120 --> 28:44.040
 parties where people have nice things. And I find it deeply uncomfortable for that reason.

28:45.080 --> 28:52.520
 I don't want to be sort of an activist that goes in and ruins a party. I think that's not the

28:52.520 --> 28:57.880
 courageous act. Neither is it courageous when everyone's doing some weird drug that you mentioned

28:57.880 --> 29:06.840
 to join in, I think. Courageous is more being, remaining yourself, sticking to your principles,

29:06.840 --> 29:12.040
 calmly in that room where everybody is doing the drug. And just don't do the drug. Don't make a

29:12.040 --> 29:18.200
 scene about it, but also don't do it. And I think that little act of courage over time is the way

29:18.200 --> 29:24.600
 you resist Jeffrey Epstein. That exactly the thing you said is probably the situation where charisma

29:24.600 --> 29:30.840
 works. So one charismatic person gets the little crowd going and the crowd is everybody sort of

29:30.840 --> 29:39.160
 is everybody sort of establishes a norm at the little crowd. And yes, there could be some dynamics

29:39.160 --> 29:43.880
 that allow that norm to be established. Like you said, like rich and powerful people might

29:44.920 --> 29:50.920
 enjoy being rich and powerful and better than everybody else kind of thing. But

29:52.280 --> 29:58.680
 like I, especially for scientists, I thought they should have integrity and courage enough to

29:58.680 --> 30:04.200
 to see through that. Not again, as an activist, like so you can tweet about it, how courageous you

30:04.200 --> 30:09.320
 are, but just literally see there's something off here. There's something off here and I'm not going

30:09.320 --> 30:14.200
 to participate in it. I'm going to defend these scientists because something off, first of all,

30:14.200 --> 30:19.880
 You're always defending academia is disgusting. It's my favorite thing. I think that, first of all,

30:19.880 --> 30:26.200
 this is going to sound like a joke and it's not, I bet you 90% of those MIT scientists are on the

30:26.200 --> 30:30.520
 spectrum. So everyone they're going to meet is going to be off. Right? So I'm sure part of their

30:30.520 --> 30:33.320
 brain is like, okay, this person's weird. This is just them being on the spectrum.

30:33.320 --> 30:36.280
 Like the light spectrum. I couldn't even finish the joke. Okay.

30:38.280 --> 30:46.440
 Number two is off. We, we tend to, there's this poem, I forget who wrote it. It was like Nick

30:46.440 --> 30:53.720
 Cave or something. And it was describing like, I think it was Goebbels hair, normal height,

30:53.720 --> 31:00.120
 normal weight, normal. What do you expect? Horns. Right? So when you meet someone, you think

31:00.120 --> 31:04.360
 something's off, there's going to be a bell curve of what that could be. Right? It could be that

31:04.360 --> 31:08.840
 they're twitchy or maybe they're completely asocial. And then you have Jeffrey Epstein over

31:08.840 --> 31:14.040
 here. You're going to need a lot of evidence to be like, Oh, I feel something off there for this

31:14.040 --> 31:20.280
 guy's the head of an international, you know, sex trafficking ring. So yeah, you might be like, okay.

31:20.280 --> 31:24.600
 But at the same time, if their extended relationship is this guy is interested in my work,

31:24.600 --> 31:28.920
 he's going to fund my work and I don't have to give him anything in return. He's clearly intelligent.

31:28.920 --> 31:34.680
 He's appreciating it. And being a scientist is a thankless job. I, I know what it's like as an

31:34.680 --> 31:38.520
 author. When I was writing Dear Reader, the North Korea book, my friends are sick of hearing all

31:38.520 --> 31:41.800
 these North Korea anecdotes. Cause at a certain point it's like, okay, we got it. Just save it

31:41.800 --> 31:45.080
 for the book. And you know, you gotta be in that lab. You're looking at the springtails,

31:45.080 --> 31:47.320
 whatever it is you're looking at. No one knows what a springtail is.

31:47.320 --> 31:52.920
 I just disagree with you. So that'd be interesting to draw a distinction between science and writing

31:52.920 --> 31:58.360
 because the scientific process itself is fun as fuck. It's you're solving little puzzles.

31:58.360 --> 31:58.840
 Sure.

31:58.840 --> 32:04.760
 So like in itself, it's fun. So like it's rewarding. Like the reason you go into

32:05.880 --> 32:12.040
 science is you can continue really without a boss to continue having fun and solving puzzles.

32:12.040 --> 32:18.840
 That's, that's literally, so like, uh, unless you become cynical and tired of the whole thing.

32:18.840 --> 32:23.880
 So the, the people, the administration, or when you're running a large lab and what you get sick

32:23.880 --> 32:29.160
 of is the emails and the meetings and all that kind of stuff. The actual act of being in the lab

32:29.160 --> 32:36.440
 is still fun as fuck. If you allow it to be writing, I feel like is there's more priority

32:36.440 --> 32:43.080
 to publishing. Like, would you enjoy it? The tree falling in the forest, would you still enjoy any

32:43.080 --> 32:45.880
 of the books you've written if they never got published?

32:45.880 --> 32:47.960
 Not to the same extent, not even close.

32:47.960 --> 32:53.720
 Right. I think that's the thing about science. It's almost like you get a peek into the mysterious.

32:53.720 --> 32:59.240
 Yeah, but this is, okay, let me, this is where I'm coming from. Since moving to Austin,

32:59.240 --> 33:02.200
 I've bought 150, over 150 plants.

33:02.200 --> 33:06.520
 Look how you're doing the, the politician thing.

33:06.520 --> 33:09.960
 Let me be clear. All right. It's not.

33:09.960 --> 33:13.880
 Oh, you are running in 2024. This is very interesting.

33:13.880 --> 33:19.400
 I bought 150 succulents from my house. They're, they're thriving here in Austin as they wouldn't have in Brooklyn.

33:19.400 --> 33:20.600
 You have a great video about it.

33:20.600 --> 33:26.200
 Yeah. One of those plants I have is the photo I took on my Instagram. There's no other photos on the whole internet.

33:26.200 --> 33:31.240
 None of my friends care or they care like ostensibly, but like, oh, that's cool. Like I have a better plant

33:31.240 --> 33:36.200
 collection in my house than like almost any botanical succulent collection than any botanical

33:36.200 --> 33:39.160
 garden in America other than probably the Huntington and no one cares.

33:39.160 --> 33:40.920
 This is what ego looks like, by the way.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.920
 I was, I can prove it to you.

33:42.920 --> 33:45.160
 No, I know, but you don't have to rub it in.

33:45.160 --> 33:49.560
 Well, they have a big budget. I don't. So if I can put it together, they should be able to.

33:49.560 --> 33:50.200
 Right.

33:50.200 --> 33:56.920
 So I can only imagine that a scientist who studied, you know, those spiders that look like ants,

33:56.920 --> 34:02.040
 like at a certain, like, oh, and this species does this with the gender dimorphism.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.880
 Their friends are only going to care so much. So if you meet someone who has a lot of money,

34:05.880 --> 34:09.400
 who now cares about ant spiders, it's going to be exciting.

34:09.400 --> 34:13.160
 It will be very exciting. But I just wanted to push back on the,

34:14.600 --> 34:20.200
 I think the act itself should be the biggest reward. I think you're always safe.

34:20.200 --> 34:25.000
 We're talking about goodness being a safe default. I think it's a good default

34:25.000 --> 34:33.960
 for plants and for writing and for science is to just enjoy the act, even if nobody cares.

34:33.960 --> 34:36.440
 Okay. This is where this, okay. Now I'm even,

34:36.440 --> 34:39.480
 now I'm wondering why I'm pushing back so hard and I realized what it was.

34:40.280 --> 34:44.440
 Because I've made this point several times and I'm glad I can make it again.

34:45.000 --> 34:50.040
 There's this window of time that happened in my life. And I know it happens to a lot of people

34:50.040 --> 34:56.840
 when you're in your 24 to 27, 28. So 21 to 24, you still have your friends from college,

34:56.840 --> 35:02.920
 so on and so forth. But then it's kind of like a poker game and every so often people cash out.

35:02.920 --> 35:05.960
 They're like, I'm out, I'm out. They get married, they get a job, they move.

35:06.600 --> 35:12.520
 And if you are someone who is a young, ambitious creative, that window is a very rough one because

35:12.520 --> 35:18.120
 you're doing the right thing and you're not being a drug addict, you're not being a philanderer,

35:18.120 --> 35:22.760
 not that those things are wrong, but just like you're playing by the rules. You're creating your

35:22.760 --> 35:27.560
 stuff, what you want to be known for, contribution you want to make for the world. And no one cares

35:27.560 --> 35:34.600
 and it gets very lonely. And there's this very emotional disconnect about how is it that I'm

35:34.600 --> 35:40.040
 creating and I'm working hard and I'm making something happen and it's just radio silence.

35:40.040 --> 35:44.760
 So that, I don't think it's that easy when you're, you're the scientist, not me,

35:44.760 --> 35:50.520
 when you don't have any kind of external validation. Humans only have so much fuel.

35:50.520 --> 35:57.560
 TITO Nothing worth having is easy, Michael. By the way, yesterday I talked on the phone with a

35:57.560 --> 36:03.960
 person who said he was deeply moved the first time you mentioned this age group of 24 to 27. He's

36:03.960 --> 36:11.400
 like, he, he's 26, he said, and he feels the full responsibility of that and the excitement. So he

36:11.400 --> 36:17.000
 left his like corporate typey job to pursue something that he's really passionate about.

36:17.000 --> 36:22.600
 And that, that, that was like, you were an inspiration to him, which I was deeply saddened

36:22.600 --> 36:30.040
 by that. MICHAEL I also inspired Michael Alex. TITO The, the, the, the amount of mass murder,

36:30.600 --> 36:36.920
 those that were inspired by you will eventually lead to is, is truly horrifying. What were we

36:36.920 --> 36:43.800
 talking about? So Jeffrey Epstein, oh, one thing I wanted to ask you. So let's put scientists aside.

36:43.800 --> 36:52.200
 What about like world leaders? Bill Clinton, your favorite person. Why would he fly with Jeffrey

36:52.200 --> 37:00.600
 Epstein? Why would he interact with that guy? MICHAEL I mean, don't you think that that's kind

37:00.600 --> 37:06.680
 of the deal that I'm the president and I get big and powerful people flying around their jets

37:06.680 --> 37:12.440
 and that's the symbiotic relationship. TITO Yeah, but don't you also have a good BS detector? Like

37:13.480 --> 37:18.920
 don't you have a good detector for people who just want to be in your presence? Like I already

37:20.120 --> 37:23.960
 understand that there's people like this out there. Like there's people that kind of

37:24.680 --> 37:31.240
 want to use me for stuff. And you mean Tim Dylan, Tim Dylan. Um,

37:31.240 --> 37:37.800
 TITO I love that guy. You guys met? MICHAEL We haven't met yet here.

37:37.800 --> 37:40.440
 TITO We haven't met. Okay. Wow. MICHAEL We met before in New York,

37:40.440 --> 37:44.120
 but we had not since I moved here. TITO Yeah. So you should be able to

37:44.120 --> 37:47.960
 detect that there's those people and there's the people that have kindness in their heart,

37:47.960 --> 37:51.480
 even if they can benefit from the interaction with you, but they have like, they're good human

37:51.480 --> 37:56.520
 beings. I feel like you want to, you run into a lot of trouble if you surround yourself or have

37:56.520 --> 38:01.800
 any people that are manipulative like that. MICHAEL But I think you make a bad example.

38:01.800 --> 38:06.280
 Cause like, let's look at Clinton and let's look at Obama, right? So Obama, even though their

38:06.280 --> 38:12.040
 politics are very close, I'd say in many ways, Obama is apparent. We don't know. I don't know

38:12.040 --> 38:16.760
 either of them, but to me it seems very apparent that he's very similar behind closed doors as he

38:16.760 --> 38:18.680
 in front of the camera. TITO Yeah. He's, he's Barack to me.

38:18.680 --> 38:21.080
 MICHAEL Oh, yeah. Yeah. TITO He's good.

38:21.080 --> 38:27.960
 MICHAEL Clinton seems very clearly to be much more of a performer. He's in front of the cameras,

38:27.960 --> 38:32.120
 he puts on a role, but behind the cameras, he very much has a temper. He's known for that.

38:32.120 --> 38:35.000
 He's much more of a lech. TITO What's that?

38:35.000 --> 38:37.960
 MICHAEL A pervert. TITO Oh, lech with an E?

38:37.960 --> 38:39.080
 MICHAEL L E T C H. Yeah.

38:39.080 --> 38:43.880
 TITO Oh, cool. Lech. Is that like a, that's a cool term. So I can use that on the internet.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.680
 Like you're a lech. MICHAEL Yeah, you can use it on the internet.

38:46.680 --> 38:49.240
 TITO You're a dirty lech. MICHAEL Well, it's dirty is implied.

38:49.240 --> 38:52.840
 TITO Oh, so it's okay. Being redundant.

38:52.840 --> 38:55.080
 MICHAEL Yeah. TITO But it just feels like he

38:55.080 --> 38:59.400
 needs an adjective to give it more power. Anyway, I'm sorry. So Clinton is a lech.

38:59.400 --> 39:06.440
 MICHAEL Right. So you can see how there's people who want to meet, you know, the surface Bill

39:06.440 --> 39:10.680
 Clinton and I'm sure that gets old for him because he has to be on. But then there's the good old

39:10.680 --> 39:15.960
 boys where he could be a pervert and this guy's like, yeah, I know what it's like. And then he

39:15.960 --> 39:20.200
 feels like he's himself. But I'm all, we're all speculating. I mean, I don't know what Bill

39:20.200 --> 39:24.440
 Clinton is like, what was in it for him. He certainly had, could afford private jets if he

39:24.440 --> 39:28.280
 wanted to. There's no shortage of people who want to fly around the world to give speeches, you know.

39:28.280 --> 39:32.360
 TITO Can he satisfy the lech within,

39:34.440 --> 39:38.040
 without hanging out with the Jeffrey Epstein's of the world? Like, can't he get, I mean,

39:38.040 --> 39:43.000
 this is the Monica Lewinsky question to me. I'm confused by all of this. Can he get

39:43.000 --> 39:50.680
 TITO women in the legitimate way of like not using his power, not hanging out with these

39:51.320 --> 39:57.320
 shady rich people, but just like having a normal mistress like JFK had?

39:57.320 --> 39:58.520
 MICHAEL Well, JFK had a lot.

39:58.520 --> 40:02.520
 TITO I know. I understand that. But in a normal way, or I don't, I don't know enough.

40:02.520 --> 40:09.880
 MICHAEL I don't understand the Clinton psychology. First of all, the fact that you're hooking up with

40:09.880 --> 40:15.800
 someone who's close to your daughter's age, to me, I think is inherently disturbing. But she's an

40:15.800 --> 40:22.520
 adult. So okay, that's not that, that, you know, beyond the pale. But also the idea that, oh, if I

40:22.520 --> 40:28.680
 don't physically fornicate with you, it's not cheating. Like that, whatever you tell yourself,

40:28.680 --> 40:34.280
 or like, if I don't ejaculate, it's not cheating. Like these rules that

40:34.280 --> 40:38.840
 TITO And it maybe leads to some kind of slippery slope, like you start not having the rules of

40:38.840 --> 40:44.280
 MICHAEL Who you fool? I mean, if you told your wife, like, listen, it wasn't cheating. She only,

40:44.280 --> 40:49.080
 you know, performed on me. You're going to say this with a straight face? Like, do you, at a

40:49.080 --> 40:54.440
 certain point when something is so brazen, you wonder if the person even has to believe it because

40:54.440 --> 40:58.040
 who are you fooling? TITO But like, we started this,

40:58.040 --> 41:06.520
 this conversation with, there is a line between young women older than 18 and young teen, like 12,

41:06.520 --> 41:10.840
 13 kids. MICHAEL Have you ever, when's the last, oh, because you're, it's different for you because

41:10.840 --> 41:17.640
 you're at MIT. I was hanging out with Blair White, and she had a couple of fans with her, of hers,

41:17.640 --> 41:24.360
 and they were like 22, 23. And they were like children to me. Like, I'm like, to me, as someone

41:24.360 --> 41:32.280
 who is in his late 60s, to look at these people as adults, like, they look completely like kids. So

41:32.280 --> 41:38.760
 TITO Now, of course, there's exceptions. Like, I've interacted with a young 20 year olds that are

41:38.760 --> 41:44.840
 like, you're way more mature than I'll ever be. Like, the wisdom that comes out of them is quite

41:44.840 --> 41:51.880
 fascinating. MICHAEL Visually, the energy and the way they look, they looked so young to me and the

41:51.880 --> 41:59.160
 way they carried themselves. It was the idea that my instinct was let's tuck you in and read you a

41:59.160 --> 42:04.360
 bedtime story, not let me like touch you or something. It was just like, it just went into

42:04.360 --> 42:10.840
 my head. So there's, but the thing is, is it possible that in order to want to be the president,

42:10.840 --> 42:17.160
 you have to be a crazy person? TITO That you have some kind of weird view on power. It could be a

42:17.160 --> 42:23.080
 power thing too. Like, you can get away with stuff. MICHAEL Like, if I was Clinton's age,

42:23.080 --> 42:28.440
 nothing about Monica Lewinsky to me would be attractive. And also, I would just feel bad for

42:28.440 --> 42:35.000
 her because I know she's going to catch feelings. And it's kind of like, it's just like, why would

42:35.000 --> 42:40.040
 I do this to this kid? For what? Just because I want to get some like momentary pleasure? Come on.

42:40.040 --> 42:45.640
 TITO Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I'm sure she looked gorgeous to him in the moment.

42:47.320 --> 42:51.640
 Well, let me ask, we started talking about beauty. Who are you wearing?

42:51.640 --> 43:01.400
 MICHAEL So as a model, you usually don't have a shirt on when you're modeling.

43:02.600 --> 43:09.880
 So it's nice to see you dressed up today. Nice and warm.

43:09.880 --> 43:15.240
 TITO This is because, so for those who don't know, Russians don't celebrate Christmas,

43:15.240 --> 43:17.480
 obviously with the Soviet Union, Christmas was illegal.

43:17.480 --> 43:22.440
 MICHAEL No Thanksgiving, basically no major holidays where everyone gets together. This

43:22.440 --> 43:25.000
 is the one holiday, New Year's. It's the one holiday.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.360
 TITO I remember as a kid, instead of Santa Claus,

43:28.360 --> 43:30.680
 we have Ded Moroz, who's the same thing, basically.

43:30.680 --> 43:34.680
 MICHAEL It's like Android and iPhone. It's like a cheap version of Christmas.

43:34.680 --> 43:38.920
 TITO He's got this girl with him. She's like Snow White or whatever. And Russian kids,

43:38.920 --> 43:43.000
 they go to sleep on December 31st and they wake up January, they have a present under their pillow.

43:43.000 --> 43:47.800
 And I remember as a kid, this happened once and it just blew my mind. You know what I mean?

43:47.800 --> 43:51.400
 It's just like, I went to bed, my dad's like, oh, you know, you're going to have,

43:51.400 --> 43:54.680
 Ded Moroz is going to bring you a present if you've been a good kid. I'm like, I think I was

43:54.680 --> 43:58.200
 a good kid. But you don't even remember a year of your life when you're four.

43:58.200 --> 44:00.440
 MICHAEL You remember those moments.

44:00.440 --> 44:05.480
 TITO Yeah. And then I woke up and there was a present under my pillow and it just blew my mind.

44:05.480 --> 44:13.400
 And that building is still there, 1461 Sherwood Parkway in Brooklyn. And it's just also funny,

44:13.400 --> 44:20.280
 like, what I really like about kids, you know, being an uncle now is kid logic, because they have

44:20.280 --> 44:25.960
 very little data, but they're using logic to make sense of it. And sometimes it gives them the

44:25.960 --> 44:32.840
 completely wrong conclusions for the completely right reasons. I remember, you know, my bedroom

44:32.840 --> 44:37.880
 as a kid was right off the kitchen and I'd be scared of the dark a little bit. So they'd leave

44:37.880 --> 44:43.560
 the light on the kitchen while I went to sleep. And at the same time, my parents had told me,

44:43.560 --> 44:47.240
 you don't leave the lights on the house. It costs money, it wastes electricity. Right?

44:47.240 --> 44:51.720
 So I would be worried because I'm like, oh, my God, my parents leave the lights on the kitchen

44:51.720 --> 44:57.160
 all night and now it's costing them so much money. Not realizing that, you know, five minutes after

44:57.160 --> 45:00.840
 I'm out, obviously they're turning the lights off. But like in my kid logic, this was a concern of

45:00.840 --> 45:07.160
 mine. Yeah. And memories work that same way. I have a collection of memories that are stitched

45:07.160 --> 45:12.520
 together logically somehow, but they also don't really make sense. There's a few defining things.

45:12.520 --> 45:21.480
 So I grew up in Russia and experienced a lot of New Year's in Russia. There's a lot of incredible

45:21.480 --> 45:27.560
 things about that tradition that just warms my heart. So one, as a kid, you mentioned these kind

45:27.560 --> 45:34.040
 of stories. That's the one night of the year that kids are allowed to be adults in the following

45:34.040 --> 45:39.800
 way. Like in kid logic, you're allowed to stay up all night. Oh, yeah. Okay.

45:39.800 --> 45:43.800
 That was as late as you want, which actually ends up being, you're not used to it.

45:45.000 --> 45:50.360
 Right, you're out. You crash. But no, you get to, you know, two, three, four at night,

45:50.360 --> 45:55.800
 you stay up and what you get to witness is almost like Alice in Wonderland goes into this world.

45:55.800 --> 46:01.480
 Yeah. You get to witness what is the adult world really like. Now, obviously it's not an actual

46:01.480 --> 46:07.960
 adult world. A lot of drinking and fighting. A merriment, like laughing, fighting, arguing,

46:07.960 --> 46:15.960
 but also like in our case, like singing and like, yeah, arguing, like philosophical stuff,

46:15.960 --> 46:23.800
 but also like, if I may, how would I describe it? This is also probably a little bit of Russian

46:23.800 --> 46:29.960
 culture, but like flirtation in all of its forms, meaning like men and women just being like,

46:29.960 --> 46:31.400
 cause they dress up. Yeah, yeah.

46:31.400 --> 46:37.640
 It's like, it's joy. It's like you get to show off like dresses, whatever you got,

46:37.640 --> 46:45.320
 you show it off. This is fun. And then men too, just like friends laughing, like arguing,

46:45.320 --> 46:50.040
 just showing off the best they got with delicious food. Obviously that there's a Thanksgiving

46:50.040 --> 46:55.960
 element there where there's just so many, just you bring out all the traditional stuff.

46:56.760 --> 47:03.240
 The, yes, salad, just everything, just the full thing with the desserts and obviously the vodka,

47:03.240 --> 47:10.600
 a lot of vodka. And at the time, so this is the Soviet Union, like the biggest stuff,

47:10.600 --> 47:15.800
 and this is so sad that these are the things that I remember is like Coca Cola.

47:15.800 --> 47:16.600
 Oh yeah.

47:16.600 --> 47:23.560
 Like American, like that, I would probably kill somebody for a Dr. Pepper. It's so fascinating

47:23.560 --> 47:31.560
 that you take it for granted, sort of the results of capitalist society, the material things that

47:31.560 --> 47:40.600
 are created, but that was the ultimate happiness is to experience this new thing, sugar. I don't

47:40.600 --> 47:43.160
 know. Under scarcity you just love it.

47:43.160 --> 47:48.680
 There's like communist Coca Cola in Czech Republic. So basically they tried to rip off Coke

47:49.400 --> 47:55.400
 and it's just like, they just threw whatever they could together and it was a very poor knockoff,

47:55.400 --> 47:58.760
 as you can imagine. I forget what it's called and all the Czech people right now are getting very

47:58.760 --> 48:04.200
 angry at me because I can't think of it, but they have it now and the slogan is good or weird.

48:05.560 --> 48:09.240
 So it's like this, so they kind of reclaimed this kind of hipster soda.

48:09.240 --> 48:11.320
 Oh, that's awesome. It's almost like a parody.

48:11.320 --> 48:12.360
 That's right. Yeah.

48:12.360 --> 48:20.600
 But I think the thing I really remember is the camaraderie, like the love for each other

48:21.240 --> 48:27.880
 and neighbors too. Like you and I are neighbors now. We don't see each other that often.

48:28.520 --> 48:31.880
 I hope that changes, but a lot of it is also me. I'm just a deep introvert.

48:33.160 --> 48:35.320
 You're also the hardest working person I know.

48:35.320 --> 48:42.360
 Yeah. So it's time, but it's not like I'll go in the middle of the night at like 4 AM

48:42.360 --> 48:48.840
 and go to 7 11 and just sit there sipping a Slurpee for an hour thinking about life.

48:48.840 --> 48:54.440
 So it's not like I'm always working. Yeah, I don't know. What I mean is you get to meet your

48:54.440 --> 49:00.920
 neighbors and you get to experience their highs and their lows and you get to bitch about life,

49:00.920 --> 49:05.400
 about government, about corruption, about the unfairness of life together.

49:05.400 --> 49:09.880
 Well, it's also I think what people don't appreciate as Americans is it's very rare

49:09.880 --> 49:12.360
 in Russia to have a safe space. Yeah.

49:12.360 --> 49:19.160
 So you know that January 1st, no one's going to snitch on you. They're not going to be informants

49:19.160 --> 49:25.720
 probably. So you can vent and that's the thing with people in totalitarian countries. You have

49:25.720 --> 49:29.560
 to have the public facing persona and then behind closed doors is very different.

49:29.560 --> 49:35.560
 It all comes out. And I also remember the arguments and I've been going on Clubhouse

49:35.560 --> 49:44.360
 recently into Russian rooms just to practice Russian. And it's so beautiful to watch. I mean,

49:44.360 --> 49:49.480
 Clubhouse is a very specific collection of Russian people. Maybe it's a little bit political

49:50.760 --> 49:57.080
 and they're a little bit older. And it's interesting to watch how much they love to

49:57.080 --> 50:04.600
 argue. They love to argue. And so it would be literally, you could think of it as a

50:04.600 --> 50:07.640
 nonlinear dynamical system, okay, from an engineering perspective.

50:10.200 --> 50:16.040
 Whenever any positive topic comes up, you could feel the skepticism and then wait a minute,

50:16.040 --> 50:25.640
 this is not good. And they'll start perturbing it until they'll find some way to say, come on now,

50:25.640 --> 50:30.200
 that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. And then it goes back into argument. It's so fun to watch

50:30.200 --> 50:36.760
 because in one sense, you could see it as negative. In another, you could see it as free to express

50:36.760 --> 50:44.200
 yourself because it feels like you can solve a lot of problems by allowing yourself to just

50:44.200 --> 50:49.320
 be emotional, both emotional and say hard truth and all those kinds of things

50:49.320 --> 50:57.800
 without patting yourself on the back about it. But also it just sort of those Russian rooms

50:59.000 --> 51:04.520
 make me realize how constrained American speech is, how careful people are in the way they express

51:04.520 --> 51:12.040
 it. Even the Michael Malice's in the world, you're constantly being nuanced. There they just say

51:12.040 --> 51:17.000
 crazy shit and then they correct themselves and make fun of themselves and they completely

51:17.000 --> 51:24.280
 shift opinions a minute later. And it's chaos. I mean, it's beautiful. So I love that that

51:24.280 --> 51:31.160
 culture is, it's funny given the current regime in Russia, like how that's coupled with how people

51:31.160 --> 51:38.520
 are talking and yeah, I don't know. And I have those memories of childhood of friends that I

51:38.520 --> 51:44.520
 had of just having that true freedom of talking. And somehow that leads to deep bonds together.

51:44.520 --> 51:51.400
 When the life, when you're poor, when life has a lot of elements that are unfair,

51:51.960 --> 51:56.760
 when the government is corrupt, there's sort of, it's just, especially in the Soviet Union,

51:56.760 --> 52:01.480
 there's uncertainty about the future. All of it, you just get closer together. Like penguins

52:01.480 --> 52:07.320
 huddling together in the cold, like that March of the Penguins movie. I don't know. The friends

52:07.320 --> 52:16.680
 I've gotten there, like I get emotional every time I kind of think about those friends because

52:16.680 --> 52:22.520
 it was so close. That friendship was so fucking close. But I just really hate the Russian cynicism.

52:22.520 --> 52:28.520
 No, I know you do. And I actually disagree with you about it. You see it as cynicism. I see it as

52:29.400 --> 52:35.240
 waves on top of the water, like surface cynicism and the depths as I see the beauty of the Russian

52:35.240 --> 52:42.040
 soul. So yes, that cynicism can negatively affect a lot of people. I think you've talked about,

52:42.040 --> 52:50.040
 like as a parent, being cynical about the world and then you have dire negative consequences on

52:50.040 --> 52:54.840
 your children. They become cynical. They don't ever take big risks, they take on bold things.

52:54.840 --> 53:00.680
 And I have those arguments because the cynicism is exhausting. It's destructive. It's anti

53:00.680 --> 53:06.680
 creative. But so in their perspective is, this is what the Russian folks would say, well, yes,

53:06.680 --> 53:12.280
 that's our role. Like being cynical is being reasonable about the world.

53:12.280 --> 53:16.040
 But it's not. It's completely unreasonable. It's a complete lie.

53:16.040 --> 53:22.440
 I know. But their argument is, yes, but we're giving you this force and it's your job to resist

53:22.440 --> 53:28.760
 against it. So it's a test. I love the idea that if you're going to be creative and innovative,

53:28.760 --> 53:32.520
 you don't have enough up against you. Yeah, exactly. This is exactly it.

53:32.520 --> 53:35.960
 It's not hard enough already that I want to be an author. Now you got to be like, well,

53:35.960 --> 53:42.200
 let me just put some fire ants on top of it. So I just want to separate, I agree with you that the

53:42.200 --> 53:51.800
 cynicism is bad and destructive, but the idea that life is suffering and thinking from that

53:51.800 --> 53:56.120
 as a first principle, I think there's a lot of beauty to be discovered through that.

53:56.120 --> 54:00.920
 So there's a cynicism and then there's a horrible message.

54:02.200 --> 54:03.080
 Life is suffering?

54:05.000 --> 54:08.680
 Well, yeah. I mean, Camus. Camus doesn't think that.

54:11.000 --> 54:15.800
 Now we're going into definitions of suffering then because absurd.

54:17.400 --> 54:20.840
 Life is absurd and life is suffering are not even close to the same concept.

54:20.840 --> 54:22.920
 Well, then you're just defining the terms differently.

54:22.920 --> 54:24.200
 Well, that's because they're different terms.

54:24.200 --> 54:28.280
 Well, so is love and beauty, but let's define terms.

54:28.280 --> 54:31.240
 You're selling if your baby's in the crib, like with a fever and you're like,

54:31.240 --> 54:34.600
 oh, that's absurd. No, it's the kids suffering. It's not the same.

54:34.600 --> 54:39.320
 So yes, starvation, you've been for the white pill researching a lot of actual

54:39.320 --> 54:40.840
 specifically defined suffering.

54:41.560 --> 54:44.200
 Sure. But also a lot of wonderful things.

54:45.320 --> 54:51.960
 Right. Yeah. But the word suffering can encompass more than just specifically starving.

54:51.960 --> 54:58.200
 And it can encompass like a lot of the philosophers talk about it.

54:58.200 --> 55:00.040
 It encompass like philosophical suffering.

55:00.040 --> 55:05.560
 The fact that if you're not careful, life can appear meaningless.

55:05.560 --> 55:07.480
 You can fall into a nihilistic view.

55:09.320 --> 55:13.880
 It's difficult to have the responsibility of freedom to act in this world because you

55:13.880 --> 55:15.800
 can fuck up in so many different ways.

55:15.800 --> 55:25.320
 And then life is seemingly unfair in the sense that good things happen for no apparent reason

55:25.320 --> 55:27.960
 and terrible things happen for no apparent reason.

55:27.960 --> 55:32.920
 Like, you know, it's the old religious question of why does evil happen in the world?

55:33.560 --> 55:35.000
 Why do terrible things happen in the world?

55:35.000 --> 55:37.400
 There's this book called Six Word Memoirs, right?

55:37.400 --> 55:39.320
 Where all these different personalities.

55:39.320 --> 55:40.200
 Those are awesome.

55:40.200 --> 55:41.000
 Were you in it?

55:41.000 --> 55:41.480
 No.

55:41.480 --> 55:45.080
 I'm in it with, so you had to basically write your autobiography in six words.

55:45.080 --> 55:45.640
 Six words.

55:45.640 --> 55:47.880
 And mine was good things happen to bad people.

55:49.720 --> 55:50.600
 You see, there you go.

55:50.600 --> 55:51.400
 There's humor.

55:51.400 --> 55:51.640
 Yes.

55:51.640 --> 55:53.240
 That's your way of dealing with the suffering.

55:53.240 --> 55:54.520
 But I don't think life is inherent.

55:54.520 --> 55:58.360
 If life was suffering, we wouldn't be able to have happiness.

55:58.360 --> 55:58.760
 No.

55:58.760 --> 56:01.320
 Out of suffering, happiness is born.

56:01.320 --> 56:03.720
 So like, it's the ups and downs of life.

56:03.720 --> 56:04.520
 And what it means like...

56:05.240 --> 56:11.480
 I don't agree at all that you need to suffer in order to be happy.

56:11.480 --> 56:14.360
 I agree you have to work hard, but that's not the same thing.

56:14.360 --> 56:15.160
 Yeah, all right.

56:15.160 --> 56:17.960
 So the way I'm using suffering, and I think a lot of them use suffering,

56:17.960 --> 56:20.520
 is the way you use like gravity.

56:20.520 --> 56:23.240
 So in order for the roller coaster to work, you need gravity.

56:23.880 --> 56:26.280
 There needs to be a force that bring you down.

56:26.280 --> 56:26.680
 Sure.

56:26.680 --> 56:34.440
 In that same way, there's like, you have to resist the natural pull of nature

56:34.440 --> 56:37.320
 that wants to destroy you.

56:37.320 --> 56:41.080
 No, nature wants you to...

56:41.080 --> 56:47.320
 Nature isn't different, but we have the capacity because we're blessed with minds

56:47.320 --> 56:48.760
 and we're blessed with friends.

56:48.760 --> 56:50.680
 Yeah, to transcend nature.

56:50.680 --> 56:56.200
 Yeah, I know, but I think it's a word that captures something about life

56:58.520 --> 57:01.240
 that there's no reason to it, that is absurd.

57:01.240 --> 57:04.760
 I think to me, oftentimes the way I think about the word suffering

57:04.760 --> 57:07.240
 is synonymous with absurdity.

57:07.240 --> 57:11.720
 This is not suffering, but this is absurd.

57:11.720 --> 57:15.400
 I just noticed there's a box with a big bow on it next to you.

57:16.280 --> 57:17.800
 What's in the box, Michael?

57:17.800 --> 57:18.760
 It's your present.

57:18.760 --> 57:20.200
 So it's your present for New Year's.

57:20.200 --> 57:21.560
 Can we open it?

57:21.560 --> 57:22.120
 Yeah, sure.

57:24.200 --> 57:25.240
 What's in the box?

57:25.720 --> 57:27.320
 And you brought up suffering.

57:27.320 --> 57:28.680
 This is going to be very unpleasant.

57:28.680 --> 57:29.240
 Here you go.

57:30.760 --> 57:31.880
 I packed it myself.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.680
 Yeah, there's a whole process in there.

57:34.680 --> 57:36.360
 So there's three presents in there.

57:38.760 --> 57:41.400
 Lex, I'll read the card first.

57:41.400 --> 57:41.960
 Okay.

57:46.840 --> 57:52.200
 Something about opening presents, like tearing stuff, makes me feel like,

57:52.200 --> 57:56.360
 because like I just tore the sheet of paper, so it'll never be the same again.

57:57.160 --> 57:58.040
 It's entropy.

57:58.040 --> 57:58.840
 It's entropy.

57:58.840 --> 57:59.800
 Time is...

57:59.800 --> 58:01.400
 You've got a powerful voice.

58:01.400 --> 58:06.920
 You've got a powerful voice to Lex.

58:06.920 --> 58:07.800
 Thank you.

58:07.800 --> 58:09.400
 Maybe I should read the other card first.

58:10.040 --> 58:11.320
 You've got a powerful voice.

58:11.320 --> 58:14.840
 Listening to what you have to say always puts me in a hopeful place.

58:14.840 --> 58:17.080
 I feel like this is building up to something.

58:17.080 --> 58:21.960
 You show me how change can happen when you face the world with pride, confidence,

58:21.960 --> 58:24.120
 and a voice that can't be silenced.

58:24.120 --> 58:25.400
 Keep speaking up.

58:25.400 --> 58:27.160
 The world is listening.

58:27.160 --> 58:34.200
 Yeah, there's no cynicism in this card.

58:34.200 --> 58:34.920
 No, this is about...

58:34.920 --> 58:35.720
 This is New Year's.

58:35.720 --> 58:37.400
 This is all about hope and joy.

58:37.400 --> 58:37.900
 Love.

58:38.600 --> 58:39.160
 To Lex.

58:39.160 --> 58:40.440
 I'm seeing the binary.

58:40.440 --> 58:45.160
 To Lex, thank you for setting the path for me to move to Austin.

58:45.160 --> 58:57.320
 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1.

58:57.320 --> 58:58.040
 Michael Malice.

58:58.040 --> 58:58.540
 Yeah.

59:00.360 --> 59:01.560
 Brings tears to my eyes.

59:02.360 --> 59:03.320
 Thank you, brother.

59:03.320 --> 59:03.880
 My pleasure.

59:05.960 --> 59:07.080
 Let's get to the present.

59:09.480 --> 59:09.980
 Okay.

59:11.480 --> 59:12.600
 It's a PC box.

59:12.600 --> 59:14.280
 This is very promising.

59:15.080 --> 59:16.280
 It better not be sex toys.

59:16.280 --> 59:17.000
 I swear to God.

59:17.000 --> 59:20.280
 There's nothing inappropriate at all.

59:20.280 --> 59:20.780
 Why would it?

59:21.560 --> 59:23.160
 Why would sex toys be inappropriate?

59:23.160 --> 59:24.680
 That's sex positive.

59:24.680 --> 59:25.800
 Because you're a virgin.

59:29.320 --> 59:30.760
 You gotta bring a knife to a party.

59:35.080 --> 59:37.400
 How clever is it to put it in a PC box?

59:37.400 --> 59:37.880
 Well, I had it.

59:37.880 --> 59:38.920
 I just got a new PC.

59:40.360 --> 59:40.860
 Okay.

59:40.860 --> 59:41.880
 Get this also canned.

59:41.880 --> 59:42.600
 Get this also canned.

59:43.320 --> 59:43.820
 Yeah.

59:43.820 --> 59:45.080
 Open the can first.

59:45.080 --> 59:45.720
 Open the can.

59:49.560 --> 59:50.760
 Do you wrap this yourself?

59:56.200 --> 59:57.320
 That scared the shit out of me.

1:00:05.320 --> 1:00:06.840
 Could get back in the can.

1:00:06.840 --> 1:00:08.440
 That actually stayed in there.

1:00:08.440 --> 1:00:09.320
 That's magic.

1:00:09.320 --> 1:00:13.080
 You just gotta cut the string.

1:00:13.080 --> 1:00:13.580
 No.

1:00:20.280 --> 1:00:22.360
 You're the most beautiful troll of all.

1:00:22.360 --> 1:00:22.680
 I am.

1:00:22.680 --> 1:00:23.480
 I love you so much.

1:00:30.520 --> 1:00:31.320
 This is awesome.

1:00:31.320 --> 1:00:38.520
 Did it not work?

1:00:39.480 --> 1:00:40.040
 Pick it up.

1:00:42.440 --> 1:00:43.160
 Oh, it didn't work.

1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:50.840
 There's a terrifying springy feeling to this thing.

1:00:51.800 --> 1:00:52.920
 I don't want to open this.

1:00:52.920 --> 1:01:03.640
 I need to move something aside.

1:01:03.640 --> 1:01:04.840
 I hate you so much.

1:01:04.840 --> 1:01:05.560
 What?

1:01:05.560 --> 1:01:06.060
 What?

1:01:08.680 --> 1:01:10.040
 Oh, is it the other way?

1:01:10.040 --> 1:01:23.800
 No, just pick it up.

1:01:23.800 --> 1:01:30.520
 I can't believe I fell for that.

1:01:30.520 --> 1:01:31.800
 I hate you so much.

1:01:33.480 --> 1:01:34.680
 Wrenches are my favorite.

1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:36.840
 I can't believe I fell for that.

1:01:37.560 --> 1:01:38.060
 Okay.

1:01:38.060 --> 1:01:40.460
 And there's box number three.

1:01:40.460 --> 1:01:41.900
 It's like a matryoshka.

1:01:41.900 --> 1:01:43.180
 I can't believe that worked.

1:01:43.180 --> 1:01:43.680
 Yeah.

1:01:46.140 --> 1:01:49.180
 I wanted the box to open all these gears to fall out, but you can't get any.

1:01:49.180 --> 1:01:49.980
 You can't get them.

1:01:49.980 --> 1:01:50.480
 Yeah.

1:01:50.480 --> 1:01:52.300
 Does that really grind your...

1:01:52.300 --> 1:01:54.380
 You know what grinding is?

1:01:57.500 --> 1:01:58.460
 Why am I scared?

1:01:58.460 --> 1:02:09.020
 Okay, there's another box.

1:02:13.980 --> 1:02:15.420
 This leads to my death.

1:02:15.420 --> 1:02:17.900
 No, no, this isn't, this is, there's a story behind it.

1:02:21.020 --> 1:02:22.220
 I can't believe that worked.

1:02:22.860 --> 1:02:24.220
 Oh God, that's so good.

1:02:24.220 --> 1:02:24.720
 All right.

1:02:24.720 --> 1:02:26.560
 All right, no springs, no weapons.

1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:27.360
 No wrenches.

1:02:34.880 --> 1:02:35.380
 Okay.

1:02:35.380 --> 1:02:37.760
 So let me tell you the story behind that toy.

1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:43.360
 Tonka robots that turn into vehicles.

1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:51.600
 So when you, when I was a kid, you had transformers, but for us poor people, you had go bots.

1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:55.520
 Right? So the go bots, there were four main characters for the good guys.

1:02:55.520 --> 1:02:58.480
 It was leader one, small foot turbo and scooter.

1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:04.240
 And what was annoying is when you had the action figures, you couldn't find the ones that were on

1:03:04.240 --> 1:03:04.740
 the TV show.

1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:07.760
 And I was a big go bots fan as a kid.

1:03:08.400 --> 1:03:12.720
 And I went once to the Toys R Us in Caesars Bay in Brooklyn with my grandfather.

1:03:13.200 --> 1:03:16.800
 My grandfather was always very lucky, like just good things happen to him every so often.

1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:18.240
 And I went there.

1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:23.520
 I remember very vividly, they must have just unpacked, just loaded the shelves and how they

1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:26.720
 had the shelving, it would be like, like a grid, you know, you'd have like, it was like one, two,

1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:31.440
 three, four, five, five rows and like, uh, five by five.

1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:36.400
 And I remember it was like two up and then you have to do, you have to sit by the side

1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:37.760
 and kind of sort through them.

1:03:37.760 --> 1:03:40.640
 And with the go bots, each package had a picture of the different figures.

1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:43.520
 So the packaging wasn't uniform and they just had scooter there.

1:03:44.080 --> 1:03:45.120
 She was just sitting there.

1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:52.800
 And I was like, holy crap, so that feeling when you're a kid and you find that just sitting

1:03:52.800 --> 1:03:56.720
 on the shelf is just, it was such this, is this that scooter?

1:03:56.720 --> 1:03:59.200
 No, I have it though, but that one is for you.

1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:03.280
 I thought if you want to put it next to your other robots, open it up, I can open it up.

1:04:03.280 --> 1:04:04.160
 Yeah, that's for you.

1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:08.720
 And that way, uh, it's that symbol of joy when you have, when you're a kid, when you

1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:13.680
 find something you really want, I think it just is really, it's a symbol of joy.

1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:18.800
 I think it just is really like, so when people look at it, they'll be like, don't be hopeless.

1:04:18.800 --> 1:04:20.320
 I'll open this carefully later.

1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:21.120
 No, do it, do it.

1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:22.080
 Should I do it now?

1:04:22.080 --> 1:04:22.240
 Yeah.

1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:22.720
 Okay.

1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:23.920
 There's no way to open it carefully.

1:04:25.040 --> 1:04:26.240
 Kids don't open stuff carefully.

1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:27.680
 You rip that crap open.

1:04:27.680 --> 1:04:29.680
 But then you break it and then you cry.

1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:31.200
 That's what happens when you're a kid.

1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:32.080
 I never did that.

1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:32.400
 Okay.

1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:34.320
 Me neither.

1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:35.200
 I never cried.

1:04:35.200 --> 1:04:36.560
 I never got presents either.

1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:40.880
 That is so cool.

1:04:40.880 --> 1:04:47.760
 All right, Scooter, you symbolize childlike discovery.

1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:48.080
 Right?

1:04:53.280 --> 1:04:54.480
 The poor man's robot.

1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:56.640
 The poor man's transformers.

1:04:58.800 --> 1:05:01.120
 I think there's instructions on the back how to transform her.

1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:02.800
 To her?

1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:05.040
 I only found out as an adult that it was supposed to be a girl.

1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:05.280
 Yeah.

1:05:06.080 --> 1:05:06.400
 Wow.

1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:07.280
 This changes everything.

1:05:07.280 --> 1:05:12.400
 Thank you, Mark.

1:05:12.400 --> 1:05:13.040
 No, give me here.

1:05:13.040 --> 1:05:13.440
 Let me show it.

1:05:13.440 --> 1:05:14.800
 It looks better when she's transformed.

1:05:16.800 --> 1:05:17.440
 What?

1:05:17.440 --> 1:05:19.840
 No, there's levels to that statement.

1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:21.920
 Oh, how does it do like this?

1:05:21.920 --> 1:05:25.280
 Let me see if I remember how to do it because I had this as a kid.

1:05:26.080 --> 1:05:26.720
 Arms out.

1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:31.520
 The thing is, these are easy to break, I remember.

1:05:32.400 --> 1:05:33.200
 Is it like this?

1:05:33.200 --> 1:05:35.840
 No, oh, the front comes out.

1:05:35.840 --> 1:05:37.040
 Oh, let me see this.

1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:38.800
 Oh, this comes up.

1:05:38.800 --> 1:05:39.360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:40.400
 Yep.

1:05:40.400 --> 1:05:41.120
 So that's that.

1:05:42.320 --> 1:05:43.280
 The arms go.

1:05:43.760 --> 1:05:46.720
 I'm having visions of like baby Michael.

1:05:47.760 --> 1:05:48.800
 I can't do it.

1:05:48.800 --> 1:05:49.920
 Okay, I can't do it.

1:05:49.920 --> 1:05:50.880
 I can't figure it out.

1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:52.080
 Wow, you're right.

1:05:52.080 --> 1:05:54.000
 She looks so much better transformed.

1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:00.960
 Oh, all right, I'm going to follow the instructions in a bit and I'll leave.

1:06:00.960 --> 1:06:01.520
 Yeah, yeah.

1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:03.840
 I'll leave this failed project of yours.

1:06:05.680 --> 1:06:06.640
 Oh, there's a wheel out.

1:06:07.520 --> 1:06:09.680
 Look, I don't like this in between form.

1:06:11.680 --> 1:06:13.680
 Well, this is how it's going to be.

1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:14.180
 Okay.

1:06:15.280 --> 1:06:19.520
 Because we're going to be accepting of the transformation that takes time.

1:06:19.520 --> 1:06:20.020
 Okay.

1:06:21.040 --> 1:06:25.280
 I got, I saw this.

1:06:27.280 --> 1:06:28.000
 Oh, it's this.

1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:33.360
 A little thing when I was walking on Congress and it says resist.

1:06:33.360 --> 1:06:34.080
 It's a bracelet.

1:06:34.080 --> 1:06:35.200
 I mean, think of you.

1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:37.760
 The reason I got it is because there's two bracelets.

1:06:38.400 --> 1:06:43.360
 So one said lucky fuck and the other one said resist.

1:06:43.360 --> 1:06:47.920
 Now, I first saw resist and I'm like, and then I saw the lucky fuck and I realized I'm

1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:50.640
 a lucky fuck to find a relevant.

1:06:52.240 --> 1:06:53.760
 It makes me think of you.

1:06:53.760 --> 1:06:54.720
 This is very nice.

1:06:54.720 --> 1:06:55.760
 Resist the powerful.

1:06:55.760 --> 1:06:57.440
 Oh, that's true.

1:06:59.760 --> 1:07:00.640
 I saw this somewhere.

1:07:01.840 --> 1:07:02.800
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:07:04.800 --> 1:07:12.480
 This has to do with, in terms of resist, you often bring up the book Machiavellians by

1:07:12.480 --> 1:07:13.120
 James Burnham.

1:07:13.680 --> 1:07:18.640
 And so I was looking through, I was reading different parts.

1:07:18.640 --> 1:07:20.240
 It's a tricky read.

1:07:20.240 --> 1:07:20.960
 It's a little bit.

1:07:20.960 --> 1:07:25.600
 But there is a ebook Kindle version now that I've been working through this.

1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:27.760
 I think there's actually an audio book too, anyway.

1:07:27.760 --> 1:07:34.400
 Yeah, I just bought some, the Machiavellians is James Burnham's analysis of four thinkers

1:07:34.400 --> 1:07:36.080
 that he regards as the Machiavellians.

1:07:36.080 --> 1:07:44.720
 It was Gaetano Moscow, Vilfredo Pareto, Georges Sorel, and I'm blanking on the Moscow Pareto,

1:07:44.720 --> 1:07:47.840
 Sorel, and Georges Michel.

1:07:47.840 --> 1:07:52.560
 And I just got Pareto's autograph in the mail this week.

1:07:54.960 --> 1:07:58.320
 So he talks about freedom and liberty.

1:07:58.320 --> 1:08:05.200
 This interesting line that I'd like to get your opinion on in terms of resist and in

1:08:05.200 --> 1:08:06.320
 terms of liberty.

1:08:06.320 --> 1:08:11.600
 There's no one force, he goes, quote, there's no one force, no group, and no class that

1:08:11.600 --> 1:08:13.680
 is the preserver of liberty.

1:08:13.680 --> 1:08:17.920
 Liberty is preserved by those who are against the existing chief power.

1:08:19.680 --> 1:08:25.680
 Oppositions which do not express genuine social forces are as trivial in relation to entrenched

1:08:25.680 --> 1:08:27.920
 power as the old court jesters.

1:08:28.880 --> 1:08:36.160
 So, I mean, the question here is, can liberty, are you comfortable with that definition or

1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:42.800
 that view of liberty, of freedom, that at its highest ideal is expressed through the

1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:46.240
 resistance to the powerful as opposed to existing in its own?

1:08:46.240 --> 1:08:53.360
 I think his point, broadly speaking, which I agree with, is the only thing that can work

1:08:53.360 --> 1:08:55.840
 to mitigate power is other power.

1:08:56.800 --> 1:09:04.960
 That talk is cheap and persuasion has very limited efficacy.

1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:11.280
 It's like if there's a burglar, right, and one person will give you a speech about property

1:09:11.280 --> 1:09:16.320
 rights and you shouldn't be in this person's house and the other person has a gun, it's

1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:18.560
 clear which is going to be more persuasive.

1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:25.520
 Yeah, but can't you just be free without the struggle, without this conflict?

1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:34.160
 What I'm uncomfortable with this view is how closely it links freedom and conflict.

1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:39.520
 Like, why does this world have to have conflict for you to be free?

1:09:39.520 --> 1:09:42.480
 Can't, I mean, it's, and part of it is just emphasis.

1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:44.560
 Well, you weren't just saying suffering is what leads to joy.

1:09:46.400 --> 1:09:47.920
 See, and now you're in agreement.

1:09:47.920 --> 1:09:48.240
 Thank you.

1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:51.280
 That's, I just did that just so you can come around and agree.

1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:51.760
 I win.

1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:53.040
 Next topic.

1:09:57.120 --> 1:09:59.600
 Wow, I'm playing 3D chess here.

1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:01.280
 Okay.

1:10:03.520 --> 1:10:04.480
 This is New Year's.

1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:08.000
 This is now December 31st.

1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:10.560
 I think that's how it works, but in 1973.

1:10:10.560 --> 1:10:10.880
 Okay.

1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:13.280
 We recorded this before you were born.

1:10:14.480 --> 1:10:16.640
 Oh no, years after you were born.

1:10:16.640 --> 1:10:22.000
 60, you look great for 60s, early 60s or?

1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:22.560
 Sure.

1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:22.880
 Okay.

1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:30.240
 What five things, let's say, or moments in 2021 are you grateful for?

1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:40.880
 Or people, just, I don't know, things, moments, beautiful experiences, profound essences of the

1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:41.440
 year.

1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:43.680
 Like, looking back, what are the cool things that just?

1:10:43.680 --> 1:10:44.880
 Personally or socially?

1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:49.440
 Do you exist, like, in a platonic way socially?

1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:51.760
 I mean, oh, in your personal life?

1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:52.000
 Yeah.

1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:52.720
 Anything.

1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:56.560
 You're both, you're now Michael Malice.

1:10:56.560 --> 1:11:02.080
 You exist as a social entity and a personal human being and all of it, the whole thing.

1:11:02.080 --> 1:11:04.480
 Like, what stands out to you about 2021?

1:11:05.120 --> 1:11:10.240
 The fact that for the first time in my life, other than college, I moved to a new city.

1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:12.080
 That was a very big one.

1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:14.800
 And there's no part of me that regrets it or misses New York.

1:11:15.360 --> 1:11:17.840
 So that was a very big deal for me.

1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:26.000
 What do you, about this move, about Austin itself, but maybe the move itself, maybe just

1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:30.640
 the act of moving, what's great about it to you?

1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:37.520
 The fact that I had forgotten what it's like to have a huge social network, which I had

1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:42.080
 in New York before people started falling away and then it really escalated as a result

1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:44.960
 of de Blasio and the COVID restrictions.

1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:50.400
 So to have a big crew here is something that was very validating.

1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:56.240
 The thing that's also exciting about Austin is that Austin is not a particularly big town.

1:11:56.240 --> 1:11:57.280
 It's not a particularly great town.

1:11:57.840 --> 1:12:02.720
 But everyone here, at least in the circles I travel in, is kind of a refugee from their

1:12:02.720 --> 1:12:03.520
 towns.

1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:05.360
 So there is this sense of camaraderie.

1:12:05.360 --> 1:12:07.440
 There is the sense of we're building something together.

1:12:08.080 --> 1:12:11.760
 Back in New York, when you meet someone, it would be like, who is this person?

1:12:11.760 --> 1:12:13.200
 Why am I talking to them?

1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:14.240
 Like, are they a normie?

1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:15.680
 Are they going to be weird?

1:12:15.680 --> 1:12:17.760
 And here there's very little of that.

1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:21.280
 I think there's much more sense of trust with one another when you meet new people.

1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:23.200
 So that's something that's really exciting about.

1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:27.440
 I've been introducing all my friends to each other and everyone's been hitting it off like

1:12:27.440 --> 1:12:28.160
 gangbusters.

1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:29.200
 It's really great.

1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:32.160
 So I really enjoy that about Austin.

1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:34.640
 I'm enjoying the weather, the space.

1:12:35.920 --> 1:12:38.080
 You read Kerouac and you know his stuff?

1:12:38.080 --> 1:12:38.480
 I have.

1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:39.200
 On the Road I read.

1:12:39.200 --> 1:12:40.240
 I read a biography of him.

1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:46.720
 I don't know if it was on, I think it was On the Road where he talked about that feeling

1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:53.200
 when you go into some place, you're leaving a place and you go somewhere else and the

1:12:53.200 --> 1:12:55.600
 place you're leaving disappears behind you.

1:12:55.600 --> 1:12:56.080
 Yeah.

1:12:56.080 --> 1:13:01.200
 And all the people and all, like you just think about that life and it's forever gone.

1:13:01.200 --> 1:13:09.520
 And there's some inkling of that where you get to realize your almost mortality because,

1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:12.480
 okay, that's a chapter and there's not many more.

1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:16.240
 I know it's a beautiful chapter, but now on to the next chapter.

1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:18.080
 Is there a melancholy feeling there?

1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:18.960
 No, it's the opposite.

1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:22.480
 I feel like I've been given a new lease on life because I didn't realize to what extent

1:13:22.480 --> 1:13:27.520
 there was this subtext of hopelessness in New York and also people who in New York you

1:13:27.520 --> 1:13:31.600
 don't appreciate or you appreciate it consciously, but you can't escape it emotionally how much

1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:33.920
 the winters get to you psychologically.

1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:35.600
 It's tough.

1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:38.240
 It gets dark so early, it gets cold, you can't walk around.

1:13:38.240 --> 1:13:41.440
 That's the thing that's fun about or what's fun about New York is that when the weather

1:13:41.440 --> 1:13:45.120
 is warm, you can walk for an hour and just enjoy the sunshine and there's a lot to see

1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:45.840
 and do.

1:13:45.840 --> 1:13:47.520
 But in the winter, you don't have any of that.

1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:48.480
 It's brutal.

1:13:49.040 --> 1:13:51.440
 And here it's just, so that is something.

1:13:51.440 --> 1:13:53.120
 There's no melancholy at all.

1:13:53.840 --> 1:13:58.720
 Well, that's because there's, can we say something beautiful about New York?

1:13:58.720 --> 1:14:00.560
 Not the way it is now, but the way it...

1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:03.280
 I could go on for days about how great New York was.

1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:09.280
 What did you learn about human civilization and just life that was beautiful from New York?

1:14:09.280 --> 1:14:20.160
 I learned that there's a lot of really unique special people out there who are doing their

1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:23.520
 little part to move the envelope and make the world a better place.

1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:32.160
 And that when you have a city where they're all there together at the same time, then

1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:33.360
 that really moves the world.

1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:40.640
 And I'm thinking of Paris in the 20s and Harlem in the 20s and New York in the 70s and LA

1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:43.920
 in the late 60s and San Francisco, especially in the late 60s, things like this.

1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:47.520
 They really punch above Detroit, certainly at its heyday.

1:14:47.520 --> 1:14:53.360
 They punch above their weight and just really kind of Philadelphia in 1700s.

1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:56.480
 Things really start happening and that ripples throughout the world.

1:14:57.040 --> 1:15:01.920
 You think Austin has a chance to be a Paris in some way?

1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:04.800
 Yes, because again, it wasn't all of Paris.

1:15:04.800 --> 1:15:08.880
 It was the left bank of Paris and Gertrude Stein and Hemingway and all them in a little

1:15:08.880 --> 1:15:09.680
 area.

1:15:09.680 --> 1:15:15.280
 So when you read these history books, these scenes, it's like 50 people in a ten block

1:15:15.280 --> 1:15:15.680
 radius.

1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:18.800
 These aren't these huge like Davos conventions.

1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:22.400
 Okay, so the move, the big move.

1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:23.600
 What else?

1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:24.960
 What else stands out to you?

1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:30.240
 Again, both personally and socially, like zooming in and zooming out.

1:15:30.240 --> 1:15:35.760
 I did a book with a UFC fighter and I was making the point, he was a nine time world

1:15:35.760 --> 1:15:39.920
 champion, that I would never be as good at my job as he was at his.

1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:46.080
 And then when I dropped Anarchist Handbook in May and it was the top nonfiction book

1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:50.720
 on Amazon for like most of the day, I was like, oh, I'm the top nonfiction writer in

1:15:50.720 --> 1:15:52.400
 America just for today.

1:15:52.400 --> 1:15:53.120
 I was like, oh, crap.

1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:54.800
 Okay, so I guess I was wrong.

1:15:54.800 --> 1:15:56.400
 That was a major deal.

1:15:56.400 --> 1:15:58.640
 I was still shocked and delighted.

1:15:58.640 --> 1:16:02.800
 By the way, congratulations and I'm truly happy for you, man.

1:16:04.080 --> 1:16:04.720
 I'm so proud.

1:16:05.280 --> 1:16:14.320
 But it's also, I'm proud because these are people who had points of view and they didn't

1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:17.680
 have it easy and they fought for what they believed in.

1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:24.080
 And insofar as I get to rescue them to some extent from the dustbin of history and say

1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:26.800
 these people really mattered and they really are worth hearing.

1:16:26.800 --> 1:16:27.600
 That I love.

1:16:27.600 --> 1:16:28.720
 I love stuff like that.

1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:35.840
 I was talking to a friend of mine, Topher, like a year ago, because we're in a weird

1:16:35.840 --> 1:16:37.600
 position with what kind of jobs we have.

1:16:38.080 --> 1:16:41.520
 So I'd be talking in my live streams about people like Candy Darling or Wallace Thurman

1:16:42.240 --> 1:16:45.120
 and these are not household names at all.

1:16:45.600 --> 1:16:50.400
 And then I'd be proud of myself that I'm the one who brings them to some sort of more

1:16:50.400 --> 1:16:51.440
 prominence.

1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:54.160
 And then you want to tell yourself, well, get over yourself who you think you are.

1:16:54.160 --> 1:16:57.520
 But it's like, but no one else is talking about these people or very few.

1:16:57.520 --> 1:17:03.120
 So to be able to kind of give them some kind of stature and platform that they deserve,

1:17:03.120 --> 1:17:05.680
 I think is, I love being able to do that.

1:17:05.680 --> 1:17:09.840
 So you have a strong voice yourself and to sort of join them in.

1:17:09.840 --> 1:17:17.360
 It's like John Lennon joining in with the Beatles is like a chorus of very different

1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:18.960
 views on anarchism.

1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:28.320
 It's celebrating the individuals, it's celebrating the idea and you are, I think will be remembered

1:17:28.320 --> 1:17:34.960
 as a powerful philosopher yourself, but like you're almost taking just the humility of

1:17:34.960 --> 1:17:38.080
 being in a room with powerful minds together in one book.

1:17:38.080 --> 1:17:38.800
 It's cool.

1:17:38.800 --> 1:17:39.040
 Yeah.

1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:43.040
 And that these people mattered and they had a unique perspective.

1:17:43.040 --> 1:17:48.640
 And as I said in the introduction to the book, I remember I was in college and we were studying

1:17:48.640 --> 1:17:54.720
 bioethics and there was like a graph in the book and one part says antinomianism, which

1:17:54.720 --> 1:17:57.760
 was the view that, and one side said legalism, right?

1:17:57.760 --> 1:17:58.960
 The two extremes.

1:17:58.960 --> 1:18:03.440
 Legalism is what is legal is defined by the government or what is moral is defined by

1:18:03.440 --> 1:18:04.000
 the government.

1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:09.120
 And one said, antinomianism, which is nothing stands above moral law.

1:18:09.120 --> 1:18:11.520
 And then there was like, well, since no one believes in this, the answer is something

1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:12.160
 to the other side.

1:18:12.160 --> 1:18:14.080
 It's like, well, why is it on the charge no one believes?

1:18:14.080 --> 1:18:15.520
 If it has a name, someone believes in it.

1:18:15.520 --> 1:18:21.920
 So anarchism is a word that's bandied about and in a dismissive way.

1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:24.960
 And it's like, you don't have to like me or agree with what I'm saying, but you can't

1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:26.960
 pretend that they weren't Tolstoy.

1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:29.280
 You're going to tell me Tolstoy doesn't know what he's talking about completely.

1:18:29.280 --> 1:18:30.160
 He's in there.

1:18:30.160 --> 1:18:31.040
 He was an anarchist.

1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:34.320
 So it was a big accomplishment.

1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:38.400
 It was really cool to get a chance to do the audio book.

1:18:39.520 --> 1:18:44.960
 You did an incredible thing, which has got a bunch of really cool people to read a lot

1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:46.800
 of interesting, varied people.

1:18:46.800 --> 1:18:51.920
 So what I did for the audio book, which I don't like the idea that hard work is inherently

1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:55.280
 good because sometimes being lazy is actually the right choice.

1:18:55.840 --> 1:18:56.720
 So I'm like, wait a minute.

1:18:56.720 --> 1:19:00.320
 Why am I reading all 23 chapters when it's 23 different authors?

1:19:00.320 --> 1:19:01.360
 Does it make sense?

1:19:01.360 --> 1:19:06.240
 So I hit my Rolodex and I had different people read different chapters to make it sound

1:19:06.240 --> 1:19:10.560
 literally like you have the different voices in the book.

1:19:10.560 --> 1:19:11.440
 Thank you very much.

1:19:11.440 --> 1:19:13.200
 You did my because I was going to read my chapter.

1:19:13.200 --> 1:19:13.760
 Wait a minute.

1:19:13.760 --> 1:19:15.440
 All the other authors are being read by somebody else.

1:19:15.440 --> 1:19:16.480
 Let's have Lex read mine.

1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:23.280
 The one chapter I am most moved by is Lauren Chen.

1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:24.640
 She's a podcaster as well.

1:19:24.640 --> 1:19:25.920
 She's expecting now.

1:19:25.920 --> 1:19:29.040
 So we wish nothing but the best for Lauren and Liam and the Babby.

1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:34.080
 There's a chapter there by this guy named Charles Robert Plunkett called Dynamite.

1:19:34.640 --> 1:19:41.120
 And he's advocating for making bombs and killing people, killing the forces of capitalism.

1:19:41.120 --> 1:19:46.640
 And Emma Goldman was publishing her essay while she was on lecture tour and she was just like,

1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:47.600
 why is this in here?

1:19:47.600 --> 1:19:51.200
 This is just really going to make us look bad, so on and so forth.

1:19:51.840 --> 1:19:56.720
 And when you're dealing with any kind of, you know, HL Mencken has that quote about

1:19:56.720 --> 1:20:02.640
 every rational man must at times be tempted to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag,

1:20:02.640 --> 1:20:03.840
 and begin slitting throats.

1:20:03.840 --> 1:20:10.480
 So I want it to sound like the seductive aspect of violence.

1:20:10.480 --> 1:20:13.440
 Like that's the problem when you're dealing with terrorism, when you're dealing with

1:20:13.440 --> 1:20:19.280
 political violence, to be able to understand how people can fall for this, how people can

1:20:19.280 --> 1:20:24.480
 be persuaded to think this is a good idea that I'm going to make some dynamite and

1:20:24.480 --> 1:20:29.920
 throw it into this crowd and kill police officers and innocent people possibly in service of

1:20:29.920 --> 1:20:35.040
 by, you have to, it's easy to say, oh, they're all crazy, but they're not, you know, even

1:20:35.840 --> 1:20:38.480
 not most people who are crazy don't do these things, you know?

1:20:39.040 --> 1:20:44.720
 So to have a woman read that chapter and I told her kind of read it like a phone sex

1:20:44.720 --> 1:20:50.800
 operator, because I wanted to have that siren song of like, so you can understand why this

1:20:50.800 --> 1:20:54.720
 calls out to people who are in the rope, the people who are like marginalized.

1:20:54.720 --> 1:20:57.280
 And she did such a superb job with that chapter.

1:20:57.280 --> 1:20:58.960
 That's such a beautiful vision.

1:20:58.960 --> 1:21:06.880
 Yeah, because violence, that's a violence part of human history to a degree that it

1:21:06.880 --> 1:21:08.160
 must be seductive.

1:21:08.160 --> 1:21:11.120
 It must be, there must be a strong pull.

1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:12.720
 Like it's not insane people.

1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:18.960
 There's something probably deep within our nature that craves violence.

1:21:18.960 --> 1:21:25.120
 And then when there is charismatic leaders that inspire that and revolution, you know,

1:21:25.120 --> 1:21:33.360
 and revolution plus violence, I could see that being extremely seductive to us.

1:21:33.360 --> 1:21:37.360
 Like when you're truly suffering in your current situation, whatever it is, you're

1:21:37.360 --> 1:21:42.080
 being oppressed by governments or being oppressed by the powerful, violent revolution is

1:21:44.720 --> 1:21:47.440
 probably there's something deep within us that longs for that.

1:21:47.440 --> 1:21:50.560
 And also this kind of the Jelaine Maxwell to Jeffrey Epstein, right?

1:21:50.560 --> 1:21:54.160
 You need that woman to be like, no, no, this is okay, honey.

1:21:54.160 --> 1:21:54.640
 Yeah.

1:21:54.640 --> 1:21:55.440
 Come along.

1:21:55.440 --> 1:21:56.640
 It's not a big deal.

1:21:56.640 --> 1:21:58.240
 Don't listen to what your parents told you.

1:21:58.240 --> 1:21:59.520
 They're just prudes.

1:21:59.520 --> 1:22:00.560
 It's a siren song.

1:22:02.080 --> 1:22:05.920
 What do you think about Jelaine Maxwell and the trial and so on?

1:22:07.040 --> 1:22:13.680
 Again, maybe the interesting story there is about the coverage of the trial.

1:22:13.680 --> 1:22:18.960
 So like the story is more complex and interesting than the actual horrific acts themselves.

1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:25.760
 So to me, I don't, maybe I'm not knowledgeable enough, but to me, she's also truly evil.

1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:32.000
 I don't know where to, maybe you can help me to figure out who is more evil.

1:22:32.880 --> 1:22:39.200
 The, just like you said now, the person that says it's okay, it's okay, that helps

1:22:39.840 --> 1:22:42.800
 the evildoer or is it the evildoer themselves?

1:22:42.800 --> 1:22:47.200
 I don't know, but I think she's a, she scares me more than Jeffrey Epstein somehow.

1:22:47.200 --> 1:22:48.880
 There's people like that in the world.

1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:50.240
 I had a, like a Twitter poll.

1:22:50.240 --> 1:22:54.320
 Do you think it's more evil or less evil to kill someone because you've been paid to do it?

1:22:55.680 --> 1:23:04.160
 And people, the winning answer was more evil and I said it was less because I think in that case,

1:23:04.160 --> 1:23:08.080
 you can kind of check out, you could be like, this isn't my, I'm just doing a job.

1:23:08.080 --> 1:23:14.240
 I don't, you know, you kind of can, I think in a sense, if you have a certain mindset,

1:23:14.240 --> 1:23:18.160
 if you have a certain mindset, like intellect to remove yourself from the situation,

1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:19.040
 I'm just the conduit.

1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:23.840
 When you were talking, I haven't been following her case that that much.

1:23:24.560 --> 1:23:27.440
 It's because you mostly watch CNN and CNN's not covering it.

1:23:27.440 --> 1:23:36.160
 Well, I think my broader point would be people who are untouchable and who know they're untouchable

1:23:36.960 --> 1:23:43.360
 do much worse things than those of us who aren't that way can appreciate.

1:23:43.360 --> 1:23:48.160
 Like I was just talking about on Twitter about Rosemary Kennedy.

1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:50.880
 She was one of JFK's sisters.

1:23:51.520 --> 1:23:58.240
 It's not clear whether she was developmentally disabled or had like depressive mental illness.

1:23:58.240 --> 1:24:01.120
 There was something clearly off with her to some capacity.

1:24:01.920 --> 1:24:06.080
 And at age 23, they gave her a lobotomy.

1:24:06.720 --> 1:24:09.200
 And the thing with the lobotomy is you have to be conscious.

1:24:09.200 --> 1:24:10.720
 They don't put you under.

1:24:10.720 --> 1:24:14.720
 So you have to be counting backwards while their scalp was in your brain and they stopped.

1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:16.160
 But they stopped.

1:24:17.040 --> 1:24:18.000
 They did too far.

1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:22.240
 She became mentally like a two year old, never had bladder control for the rest of her life,

1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:24.000
 couldn't really talk or walk.

1:24:24.720 --> 1:24:30.720
 And when that happened, they just put her away to some home and they never mentioned her again.

1:24:30.720 --> 1:24:33.200
 They didn't tell the brothers or sisters where she went.

1:24:33.200 --> 1:24:35.680
 The lobotomy was only revealed in 1987.

1:24:35.680 --> 1:24:40.800
 And they pretended, oh, she's in this home for kids with special needs.

1:24:40.800 --> 1:24:48.960
 And it's just like that to me is very, very scary that someone could do this to their...

1:24:48.960 --> 1:24:54.240
 I saw people respond like, oh, that was cutting edge technology at the time, ha ha.

1:24:54.240 --> 1:25:01.040
 But I'm like, I don't think that that was really done that frequently or be hearing more about it,

1:25:01.040 --> 1:25:02.480
 all these botched lobotomies.

1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:06.720
 And my understanding is lobotomies are very hard to...

1:25:09.040 --> 1:25:12.400
 They would want to do it if someone's a mass murderer or if someone's really bad,

1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:16.000
 if the person's left an invalid, who cares kind of situation.

1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:19.840
 But when you're dealing with something like this, she's not killing people.

1:25:19.840 --> 1:25:20.960
 She's not assaulting people.

1:25:21.680 --> 1:25:25.280
 She's just difficult because she's making your vaunted family look bad.

1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:30.800
 So that's, to you, that's, what is it, psychopathy or something like that?

1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:34.880
 You don't care about, you do horrific things and you don't really care.

1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:36.720
 I can't diagnose Joe Kennedy.

1:25:37.280 --> 1:25:43.600
 But what I would say, like with Jelayne Maxwell, I can't empathize because I don't understand...

1:25:43.600 --> 1:25:48.720
 First of all, even in a positive sense, I don't know what it's like to be grooming my son to be

1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:51.760
 the president and lost the other son in war.

1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:52.640
 I don't know what that's like.

1:25:53.280 --> 1:25:55.280
 I don't know what it's like to be so wealthy.

1:25:55.280 --> 1:25:59.120
 Like you have to give Joe Kennedy credit because a lot of what he was fighting for

1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:04.800
 was to allow Irish people and Catholic people acceptance into like high society.

1:26:04.800 --> 1:26:07.040
 And he was up against a lot of pressure with that.

1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:09.280
 And he's like, I'm going to screw these people.

1:26:09.280 --> 1:26:11.920
 I'm going to be recognized and we're going to make people recognized.

1:26:11.920 --> 1:26:13.040
 So there's something to be said for that.

1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:16.960
 But I mean, I can't relate to people like him.

1:26:18.560 --> 1:26:19.060
 Yeah.

1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:23.280
 But I mean, that like is just terrifying.

1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:28.080
 Like, I mean, one of the big reasons I'm an anarchist is like when you have someone who

1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:33.040
 has that sense of amount of power over somebody else, a lot of times they're going to do bad

1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:35.360
 things and have no consequences.

1:26:36.240 --> 1:26:41.520
 Do you think in a, just like Maxwell case and Epstein case, do you think they were

1:26:43.440 --> 1:26:45.040
 trying to blackmail people?

1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:48.080
 Like trying the, what the conspiracy theory is kind of described

1:26:49.360 --> 1:26:51.760
 that's probably not too far away from reality.

1:26:51.760 --> 1:26:57.840
 That they intentionally tried to put powerful people in compromising situations so that

1:26:57.840 --> 1:27:01.360
 they can basically get more and more power.

1:27:01.360 --> 1:27:01.860
 Yeah.

1:27:01.860 --> 1:27:05.520
 I think that was a Vanity Fair piece that you're referring to or Fortune.

1:27:05.520 --> 1:27:06.020
 Oh, sorry.

1:27:06.020 --> 1:27:07.680
 I'm just referring to a general concept.

1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:11.280
 Oh, there was, so there was an article that broke this down because this article is either

1:27:11.280 --> 1:27:15.200
 Fortune, Businessweek, Vanity Fair, I don't remember a major, major reputable outlet.

1:27:15.200 --> 1:27:19.600
 And they were, they made the, the reporter made the point, they asked around and they

1:27:19.600 --> 1:27:22.880
 go, this guy's a billionaire or extremely wealthy at least.

1:27:22.880 --> 1:27:25.120
 No one I know ever traded with him.

1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:26.240
 Like, where's his money coming from?

1:27:26.240 --> 1:27:27.680
 There's no, there's no paper trail.

1:27:27.680 --> 1:27:33.360
 So they're like, okay, if it's not trading and trades are public often, you know, where's

1:27:33.360 --> 1:27:34.320
 this money coming from?

1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:39.760
 And it's also like, why are all these people allowing Epstein to be their business manager

1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:42.080
 when he has no kind of track record to show for it?

1:27:42.080 --> 1:27:47.760
 So the hypothesis was he would get people into uncompromising situations with underage

1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:52.960
 girls, secretly film it, and then he would, you know, blackmail them accordingly.

1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:54.000
 Well, I guess that's the question.

1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:54.960
 That would make sense.

1:27:54.960 --> 1:27:59.600
 I know it makes sense, but I also see a lot of evidence that he's just very charismatic

1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:00.400
 in a room.

1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:07.120
 So, so, and I've also seen, you know, that's how human connections get made, like business

1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:07.840
 deals get made.

1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:10.080
 Yeah, but how, how, where's his money coming from?

1:28:10.800 --> 1:28:14.720
 Oh, like they are rich people without blackmailing.

1:28:14.720 --> 1:28:19.920
 Just like him close, like him as a friend.

1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:20.640
 I'm not arguing that.

1:28:20.640 --> 1:28:24.000
 Like, okay, I like Jeff Epstein, make sure you pull that quote.

1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:24.480
 Yes.

1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:25.120
 I'm a business person.

1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:25.920
 I like Jeff Epstein.

1:28:25.920 --> 1:28:26.400
 Michael Malice.

1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:27.120
 I love Jeff.

1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:27.920
 Like or love?

1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:28.320
 Love.

1:28:28.320 --> 1:28:31.600
 I'm in love with this escalated quickly.

1:28:31.600 --> 1:28:36.960
 I'm going to hand over him to be my money manager to have 20% of my estate fine.

1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:37.440
 Yeah.

1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:40.800
 Where is he making the money for that 20%?

1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:43.040
 That's the thing that there's no paper trail.

1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:45.920
 That's the thing that there's no paper trail, have him trading or anything.

1:28:45.920 --> 1:28:46.720
 So I can understand.

1:28:46.720 --> 1:28:47.680
 Oh, I see, see.

1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:48.180
 Yeah.

1:28:48.800 --> 1:28:49.520
 Interesting.

1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:52.960
 What were your 2020 favorite moments?

1:28:52.960 --> 1:28:54.400
 You mean 2021?

1:28:54.400 --> 1:28:54.720
 Yeah, 2021.

1:28:54.720 --> 1:28:55.600
 Time flies when you have it.

1:28:55.600 --> 1:28:56.100
 Yeah, yeah.

1:28:57.840 --> 1:29:00.240
 Clearly it's the Ghislaine Maxwell trial.

1:29:00.240 --> 1:29:01.600
 It just really stands out to me.

1:29:01.600 --> 1:29:02.720
 It's very moving.

1:29:02.720 --> 1:29:03.840
 Which is why I bring it up.

1:29:04.560 --> 1:29:05.060
 No.

1:29:05.920 --> 1:29:06.880
 Moving here.

1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:08.080
 So moving here.

1:29:08.080 --> 1:29:12.400
 But for me, I think we actually didn't cover that with you.

1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:13.680
 And I'd love to get your comment.

1:29:15.280 --> 1:29:17.680
 Because you said it's for the first time in your life you moved.

1:29:17.680 --> 1:29:20.960
 So it's not just about the place you go to.

1:29:20.960 --> 1:29:24.400
 It's the actual act of moving is also a leap.

1:29:24.400 --> 1:29:25.280
 Oh, yeah.

1:29:25.280 --> 1:29:31.360
 The decision was that I'm going to give away my salary at MIT.

1:29:31.360 --> 1:29:32.720
 So stop taking salary.

1:29:33.520 --> 1:29:35.040
 Give away the group.

1:29:35.040 --> 1:29:38.800
 So students, no more research, the grant funding.

1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:41.920
 I still keep an MIT affiliation just because I have friends and colleagues

1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:42.960
 there still doing research.

1:29:42.960 --> 1:29:46.720
 But giving away really primarily is the source of money.

1:29:46.720 --> 1:29:47.920
 So no salary.

1:29:47.920 --> 1:29:49.520
 And let it go to zero.

1:29:49.520 --> 1:29:51.120
 Let my bank account go to zero.

1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:58.080
 And take a leap in San Francisco or elsewhere.

1:29:58.880 --> 1:30:04.000
 And as COVID broke out, and a lot of people started talking to me about San Francisco,

1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:05.440
 about the cynicism there.

1:30:05.440 --> 1:30:06.720
 And I would go there.

1:30:06.720 --> 1:30:11.760
 And there was a kind of, so it's not all the woke stuff and all that kind of things.

1:30:11.760 --> 1:30:13.520
 Which is also a problem.

1:30:13.520 --> 1:30:19.920
 It's less about dreaming about a big future, about building a big future, and more about

1:30:19.920 --> 1:30:25.680
 some kind of identity politic battles that they're just, you could say some aspect in

1:30:25.680 --> 1:30:27.680
 the positive light is important.

1:30:27.680 --> 1:30:33.120
 But in a place like Silicon Valley, to me, the most important thing is to do big things.

1:30:34.160 --> 1:30:37.840
 And for that to be most of the conversation.

1:30:39.040 --> 1:30:40.640
 And so that cynicism was there.

1:30:40.640 --> 1:30:44.240
 And then I went to look at Austin, and Austin was the opposite.

1:30:44.240 --> 1:30:45.840
 It was the optimism.

1:30:45.840 --> 1:30:53.040
 And you have people like, I talked to Elon, was the optimistic about making this the capital

1:30:53.040 --> 1:30:55.600
 of artificial intelligence and technology and so on.

1:30:55.600 --> 1:31:03.360
 And Mr. Joe Rogan, now just the optimism about making this the cultural capital of the world.

1:31:04.320 --> 1:31:07.920
 I mean, specifically comedy, but it just radiates from them.

1:31:07.920 --> 1:31:08.960
 Just the excitement.

1:31:08.960 --> 1:31:12.480
 And I've seen not many people of that nature in my life.

1:31:12.480 --> 1:31:17.440
 And when I see that in their eyes, that engine, that fire of wanting to create something special

1:31:17.440 --> 1:31:18.000
 about the place.

1:31:18.640 --> 1:31:20.960
 First of all, those people rarely fail.

1:31:20.960 --> 1:31:21.680
 That's first of all.

1:31:21.680 --> 1:31:23.040
 And second of all, that's contagious.

1:31:23.040 --> 1:31:23.840
 It's contagious.

1:31:23.840 --> 1:31:25.200
 Very contagious.

1:31:25.200 --> 1:31:32.960
 And so all that combined, for me, 2021 was the actual leap of taking the leap, saying,

1:31:32.960 --> 1:31:39.360
 all right, well, I'm actually going to do this, so not just giving away the salary,

1:31:39.360 --> 1:31:41.760
 not giving away all of that, but the whole thing.

1:31:42.400 --> 1:31:43.200
 That's it.

1:31:43.200 --> 1:31:44.720
 You just move to a place.

1:31:44.720 --> 1:31:49.680
 There's an empty building, and you're moving into it.

1:31:51.760 --> 1:31:53.360
 And this is a new life.

1:31:53.360 --> 1:31:54.720
 And that leap, I don't know.

1:31:54.720 --> 1:31:59.520
 It's a scary leap to take, because I've taken that leap many times in my life.

1:31:59.520 --> 1:32:03.840
 And this is where parents and all those kinds of cynicism is really destructive.

1:32:03.840 --> 1:32:09.520
 Because from a cynical perspective, I worked at Google.

1:32:09.520 --> 1:32:10.800
 So why leave Google?

1:32:10.800 --> 1:32:14.320
 It's a very high paying salary that you can have at Google.

1:32:14.880 --> 1:32:16.080
 Then MIT.

1:32:16.080 --> 1:32:17.120
 Why leave MIT?

1:32:18.400 --> 1:32:19.520
 It's MIT.

1:32:19.520 --> 1:32:21.760
 This is you've always dreamed about.

1:32:21.760 --> 1:32:22.720
 Why do you get a PhD?

1:32:23.280 --> 1:32:24.640
 You've loved MIT all your life.

1:32:24.640 --> 1:32:25.680
 Why leave MIT?

1:32:25.680 --> 1:32:29.040
 I mean, this is the same process I've gone through with a lot of things in life.

1:32:29.040 --> 1:32:31.600
 Like you've been saying every single stage.

1:32:31.600 --> 1:32:35.920
 And you need that, you need friends, you need support groups and all those kinds

1:32:35.920 --> 1:32:37.600
 of things that are extremely important.

1:32:37.600 --> 1:32:39.440
 But in the end, it's about taking the leap.

1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:42.480
 And for me, 2021 was this leap.

1:32:42.480 --> 1:32:48.480
 And to me, one of the most beautiful things you can do in life is to take those leaps.

1:32:48.480 --> 1:32:51.360
 And that's something that I think is no longer a thing in New York.

1:32:51.360 --> 1:32:52.960
 There's no sense of hope.

1:32:52.960 --> 1:32:56.080
 You don't go to New York now.

1:32:56.080 --> 1:33:01.360
 There's been such an assault and intentionally or otherwise, maybe it's inevitable,

1:33:01.360 --> 1:33:02.480
 they didn't have a choice.

1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:05.680
 But there's been such an assault on creativity and small business in New York

1:33:06.400 --> 1:33:11.680
 that very few people who are in New York right now think things are going to get great soon.

1:33:11.680 --> 1:33:16.320
 Whereas here, I feel every day is just something exciting is going to happen.

1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:20.000
 And that's part of the culture and how the conversation goes.

1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:24.640
 It's just in vogue to be cynical in New York and San Francisco.

1:33:24.640 --> 1:33:29.600
 I hope it changes because what I love about New York and what I love about Austin also

1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:38.640
 is the weirdos, the characters, just the variety of personalities that if you just walk around,

1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:39.440
 you get to meet them.

1:33:39.440 --> 1:33:43.120
 And I think New York still has that, but it has the extra cynicism on top of it.

1:33:44.240 --> 1:33:45.440
 That's a negative.

1:33:45.440 --> 1:33:50.320
 I mean, just becoming friends with Joe, he inspired me to be nicer to people,

1:33:50.320 --> 1:33:58.240
 to not take myself seriously, to be humble, to celebrate friends, not to be competitive.

1:33:59.440 --> 1:34:04.240
 Like all those things, since I started listening to his podcast from the very beginning,

1:34:04.240 --> 1:34:06.000
 it just radiated from the guy.

1:34:06.720 --> 1:34:12.880
 The thing that people don't appreciate is Joe Rogan likes it when you bust his chops.

1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:14.240
 Yeah.

1:34:14.240 --> 1:34:17.120
 I mean, a lot of people at that level, like if it's,

1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:20.000
 oh, Mr. Rogan, you're laughing at everything they say, they don't want that.

1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:24.800
 It's very phony and they feel uncomfortable because they know everything they say is hilarious.

1:34:24.800 --> 1:34:26.480
 I remember I went with him.

1:34:26.480 --> 1:34:32.080
 He was doing a performance here and I was, yeah, you were there.

1:34:32.080 --> 1:34:33.280
 And he was doing his set.

1:34:34.080 --> 1:34:37.360
 And I'd reached the point now where I don't think of him as Joe Rogan.

1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:39.360
 You know, it's just like my buddy's doing stand up.

1:34:39.360 --> 1:34:39.840
 You forget.

1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:42.400
 And then I looked at the audience and I remember I'm like,

1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:44.960
 oh, this is like a religious experience for these people.

1:34:44.960 --> 1:34:49.360
 But you forget who he is because he doesn't carry himself like a big shot.

1:34:49.360 --> 1:34:50.160
 Yeah.

1:34:50.160 --> 1:34:52.320
 And still, I mean, he gets competitive as fuck.

1:34:52.320 --> 1:34:53.840
 Like I argue with him a lot.

1:34:53.840 --> 1:34:57.920
 I mean, when I talked to Francis Collins and Pfizer CEO,

1:34:57.920 --> 1:34:59.440
 you better believe I heard from Joe.

1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:04.000
 And then we would just get super drunk and argue about it.

1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:05.920
 So it's, I mean, it's beautiful.

1:35:05.920 --> 1:35:08.160
 And he gets really passionate.

1:35:08.160 --> 1:35:11.440
 So it's not like, it's not like easy to argue with him,

1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:15.120
 but that's great when you don't take it personally.

1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:16.640
 It's fun.

1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:20.160
 As you and I discussed, and I'm sure he wouldn't mind us saying this,

1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:24.560
 but like that moment when you first get a text from Joe Rogan

1:35:24.560 --> 1:35:26.080
 and it's some boomer meme,

1:35:26.080 --> 1:35:29.280
 like I finally felt like I've arrived as a person.

1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:30.000
 A boomer meme?

1:35:30.560 --> 1:35:32.000
 What kind of boomer meme are we talking about?

1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:33.840
 Like some silly meme, but it's just like,

1:35:33.840 --> 1:35:36.480
 this is the kind of thing you can imagine someone's uncle posting on Facebook.

1:35:36.480 --> 1:35:36.960
 Yeah.

1:35:36.960 --> 1:35:38.240
 It's Joe Rogan texting it to you.

1:35:39.120 --> 1:35:39.600
 Yeah.

1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:42.240
 I mean, for me also with Elon, obviously,

1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:44.640
 there's a few people, I'm just saying folks that people know,

1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:48.720
 also Jim Keller, who's worked with Elon.

1:35:48.720 --> 1:35:50.480
 So I've had conversations with them,

1:35:50.480 --> 1:35:52.320
 because it's just my line of work.

1:35:52.320 --> 1:35:56.080
 They're realizing that everything is possible in this world.

1:35:56.080 --> 1:35:56.640
 Yeah, yeah.

1:35:57.280 --> 1:35:59.280
 Which is not the Russian mindset.

1:35:59.280 --> 1:35:59.680
 Yeah.

1:35:59.680 --> 1:36:00.160
 Well, okay.

1:36:00.160 --> 1:36:00.560
 All right.

1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:02.480
 That's, let's, uh.

1:36:02.480 --> 1:36:05.120
 It's dialed down a notch.

1:36:05.120 --> 1:36:06.320
 It's dialed down a notch.

1:36:06.320 --> 1:36:09.440
 Yeah, it's what Elon calls first principles thinking,

1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:14.080
 but really it's just not being limited by the constraints of the past.

1:36:14.080 --> 1:36:14.640
 Yes.

1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:17.680
 And so saying like, okay, this is how things have been done,

1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:19.360
 but can be done much, much better.

1:36:19.920 --> 1:36:22.240
 And that has to do with manufacture.

1:36:22.240 --> 1:36:26.320
 Like, how do we do this 10 times cheaper?

1:36:27.520 --> 1:36:30.000
 Like everyone says it's super expensive,

1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:31.840
 but does it really need to be?

1:36:31.840 --> 1:36:33.520
 This is more of a question about manufacture,

1:36:33.520 --> 1:36:36.080
 about how to build a product, how to build a product.

1:36:36.080 --> 1:36:39.360
 How to actually have a product that scale that has an impact.

1:36:39.360 --> 1:36:41.600
 And just having a very serious engineering,

1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:43.840
 like to the level of physics,

1:36:45.200 --> 1:36:49.280
 discussion about building a thing and fucking doing it.

1:36:49.280 --> 1:36:52.240
 And just being around people that did it and,

1:36:54.080 --> 1:36:58.400
 you know, basically literally or figuratively said,

1:36:58.400 --> 1:37:00.960
 fuck you to everybody in the room that said they can't do it.

1:37:01.760 --> 1:37:03.120
 And that, that energy.

1:37:03.120 --> 1:37:06.160
 So that I've gotten to know Elon a lot better in 2021.

1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:09.200
 That to me, it's like everything, the whole thing,

1:37:09.200 --> 1:37:13.520
 that moving here and being surrounded by the optimistic energy

1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:15.840
 and then the individual interactions with people

1:37:16.400 --> 1:37:20.400
 that refuse to be like brought down by the,

1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:22.240
 yeah, the cynicism.

1:37:22.240 --> 1:37:23.120
 The naysayers, yeah.

1:37:23.120 --> 1:37:23.920
 The naysayers.

1:37:25.760 --> 1:37:27.840
 That to me is what I'm going to remember this year for.

1:37:27.840 --> 1:37:33.840
 And I hope it like materializes into something concrete

1:37:33.840 --> 1:37:34.560
 here in Austin.

1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:36.160
 And I feel it's doing that.

1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:39.520
 I really am curious to be a fly on the wall.

1:37:39.520 --> 1:37:40.880
 I'm sure it'll happen at some point,

1:37:40.880 --> 1:37:42.480
 watching you and Elon talk to each other.

1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:44.720
 I guess he's even more of a robot than you.

1:37:45.280 --> 1:37:47.840
 He was on the Babylon Bee podcast

1:37:47.840 --> 1:37:49.680
 and I was honored to be able to be in the room

1:37:49.680 --> 1:37:50.640
 while this was happening.

1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:53.440
 And with the guys at the BeeDoo,

1:37:53.440 --> 1:37:57.680
 at the end of every podcast, they have like 10 questions.

1:37:57.680 --> 1:37:59.200
 I don't think this is one of those.

1:37:59.200 --> 1:37:59.840
 No, no.

1:37:59.840 --> 1:38:04.960
 And they go to Elon, would you rather be Batman or Iron Man?

1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:07.280
 Because they're both like multimillion industrialists.

1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:11.680
 And Elon being Elon is like, well, let's think this through.

1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:12.800
 There's different kinds of bats.

1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:15.520
 You've got fruit bats and you've got insect bats.

1:38:15.520 --> 1:38:16.400
 Why is it called Batman?

1:38:16.400 --> 1:38:17.680
 Batman can actually fly, right?

1:38:17.680 --> 1:38:18.320
 Bats can fly.

1:38:19.680 --> 1:38:20.800
 And I'm just sitting there like, holy dude,

1:38:20.800 --> 1:38:21.600
 just answer the question.

1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:23.120
 I was like, what?

1:38:23.120 --> 1:38:24.720
 It was so literal.

1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:25.760
 I was like, damn.

1:38:26.560 --> 1:38:30.160
 I guess by this point, the release of the podcast with him,

1:38:30.160 --> 1:38:34.800
 that's several hours and it's exactly as you would imagine.

1:38:34.800 --> 1:38:36.880
 It's exactly as you would imagine.

1:38:36.880 --> 1:38:39.280
 There was this, did you watch the movie Her?

1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:40.480
 Yes, of course.

1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:42.240
 So there's that one scene, it's when,

1:38:43.120 --> 1:38:43.840
 is it Joaquin Phoenix?

1:38:43.840 --> 1:38:45.200
 Who's the lead character?

1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:46.400
 Joaquin Phoenix.

1:38:46.400 --> 1:38:48.960
 Yeah, so he's the lead and he falls in love with Siri basically,

1:38:48.960 --> 1:38:50.320
 who's played by Scarlett Johansson.

1:38:50.320 --> 1:38:53.840
 And there's another artificial AI that she's talking to

1:38:54.400 --> 1:38:57.920
 and she's like, oh, can I permission to go into nonverbal

1:38:57.920 --> 1:39:01.920
 communication with this professor and the guy's like, sure.

1:39:01.920 --> 1:39:04.080
 And they just started talking to each other in their robot.

1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:06.640
 And I'm just imagining the two of you having this mind meld.

1:39:07.200 --> 1:39:10.000
 Well, so there's both the humor of that,

1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:14.240
 but also the practical nature of the kind of conversations

1:39:14.240 --> 1:39:19.120
 to have, it's so great because it's problem solving mode.

1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:20.800
 Okay, yeah, yeah, okay.

1:39:20.800 --> 1:39:21.200
 It's so cool.

1:39:21.200 --> 1:39:21.680
 That is fun.

1:39:21.680 --> 1:39:22.560
 That is exciting.

1:39:22.560 --> 1:39:25.520
 Because you stop completing sentences.

1:39:25.520 --> 1:39:28.320
 I actually feel at home because you don't need to say

1:39:28.320 --> 1:39:30.000
 the full sentences anymore.

1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:34.080
 You could just say random words and you start to understand

1:39:34.080 --> 1:39:36.880
 what you're talking about and then you can have multiple

1:39:36.880 --> 1:39:39.440
 conversations at the same time and go on these tangents.

1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:43.440
 One of the biggest problems I have with podcasting for me

1:39:43.440 --> 1:39:45.680
 talking, I have to finish my sentences.

1:39:45.680 --> 1:39:47.760
 I have to actually finish making a point,

1:39:47.760 --> 1:39:50.880
 which is a big problem because there's like a listener

1:39:50.880 --> 1:39:53.520
 that needs to hear the point being finished as opposed

1:39:53.520 --> 1:39:59.600
 to completing your sentences inside your own mind.

1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:03.040
 And like the thing I find is useful to Elon does exact

1:40:03.040 --> 1:40:08.640
 same thing is when the line of thinking is no longer useful,

1:40:08.640 --> 1:40:11.680
 you just ran, you just switched to the next thing.

1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:13.440
 You just leave that whole thing behind.

1:40:13.440 --> 1:40:14.800
 You don't need a nice transition.

1:40:14.800 --> 1:40:15.840
 You don't need any of that.

1:40:15.840 --> 1:40:19.920
 And also just it's the first principles thing.

1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:24.720
 It's like zooming in on the elephant in the room.

1:40:24.720 --> 1:40:25.440
 I love that.

1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:26.640
 It's so energizing.

1:40:27.360 --> 1:40:28.880
 That's what I love about engineers.

1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:33.520
 It's not the maybe most eloquent communication style,

1:40:33.520 --> 1:40:35.840
 but I love it.

1:40:35.840 --> 1:40:36.400
 What about you?

1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:41.440
 So you said moving the book, what else?

1:40:41.440 --> 1:40:48.240
 And you've been really excited about that's Anarchist Handbook,

1:40:48.240 --> 1:40:51.600
 but you've also been nonstop excited about White Film.

1:40:51.600 --> 1:40:53.360
 That was most of this year.

1:40:53.360 --> 1:40:55.520
 You've been actually made significant progress.

1:40:55.520 --> 1:40:57.920
 I'm on page 40 of the second draft.

1:40:57.920 --> 1:40:59.920
 And it's really kind of funny because when you're doing

1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:03.280
 your I think 10th book, I lost track already.

1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:06.320
 The first draft is actually pretty good.

1:41:06.320 --> 1:41:08.000
 Like I'm going back and like, all right, this is going

1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:08.640
 to be a whole slog.

1:41:08.640 --> 1:41:10.000
 I'm like, oh, I just have to cut and paste this

1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:11.680
 and basically tweak a few words.

1:41:11.680 --> 1:41:15.680
 So I did a good job with the first draft.

1:41:15.680 --> 1:41:20.560
 It's also funny when you're writing how,

1:41:21.280 --> 1:41:23.840
 and I guess this is the mark of a good professional writer,

1:41:26.800 --> 1:41:30.960
 my personal feelings don't match how the characters

1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:32.800
 in the book come off.

1:41:32.800 --> 1:41:37.280
 Like I have a lot of fondness for people like Emma Goldman

1:41:37.280 --> 1:41:40.240
 and Alexander Berkman and they're early on in the book,

1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:41.440
 but they're not good people.

1:41:42.080 --> 1:41:44.560
 And I'm writing it objectively and whatever,

1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:47.040
 and I'm reading this, I'm like, they come off much worse

1:41:47.040 --> 1:41:51.120
 than my personal appraisal of them.

1:41:52.080 --> 1:41:55.040
 So it's kind of interesting as a writer when you're watching it,

1:41:55.040 --> 1:41:56.960
 I guess, kind of like an attorney, right?

1:41:56.960 --> 1:41:59.760
 Like you can have a situation where you as an attorney,

1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:02.480
 you have a lot of fondness for your client,

1:42:02.480 --> 1:42:04.560
 but you realize that they probably did this thing

1:42:04.560 --> 1:42:06.800
 or you could not, it could be other way.

1:42:06.800 --> 1:42:09.120
 Like they're innocent, but it's hard for you

1:42:09.120 --> 1:42:11.680
 to make a good case for them because the data's not there.

1:42:11.680 --> 1:42:13.840
 Can you actually talk about your writing process

1:42:13.840 --> 1:42:14.400
 in several ways?

1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:16.080
 So one, your writing process, but two,

1:42:16.080 --> 1:42:18.320
 by way of advice of how to write.

1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:20.080
 You've talked about in the past,

1:42:20.080 --> 1:42:24.080
 like your first draft is these kind of disparate

1:42:24.080 --> 1:42:25.680
 or more chaotic in that you don't,

1:42:25.680 --> 1:42:27.280
 in the same way maybe I was saying

1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:28.480
 in the engineering discussion,

1:42:28.480 --> 1:42:30.080
 you don't complete the sentences.

1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:31.200
 It's just like thoughts.

1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:35.680
 The first like real good writing advice I remember getting

1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:38.320
 was this book by Peggy Noonan called

1:42:38.320 --> 1:42:39.600
 What I Saw at the Revolution.

1:42:40.400 --> 1:42:42.320
 And she was Ron Reagan's speech writer.

1:42:42.320 --> 1:42:44.160
 She still writes for the Wall Street Journal.

1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:47.680
 The book I bought was at a used bookstore

1:42:47.680 --> 1:42:50.080
 in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania when I was in college.

1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:52.960
 The spine is cocked, I still have it, it was 99 cents.

1:42:54.400 --> 1:42:56.800
 And she talked, when you're writing for a president,

1:42:56.800 --> 1:42:59.280
 this is no joke, especially for a president

1:42:59.280 --> 1:43:01.440
 who's the great communicator, Reagan.

1:43:01.440 --> 1:43:04.800
 So, and you have to be very inspirational,

1:43:04.800 --> 1:43:07.440
 but also not come off as corny, which is very hard to do.

1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:10.640
 And she in the book talks about how she wrote speeches

1:43:10.640 --> 1:43:13.920
 for him, how she, I'm paraphrasing her

1:43:13.920 --> 1:43:16.960
 and I haven't read her book in a couple of decades,

1:43:16.960 --> 1:43:19.520
 but basically she would write like a brain dump

1:43:19.520 --> 1:43:20.480
 and it's just garbage.

1:43:20.480 --> 1:43:22.480
 And she's like, that's okay, just get it all out there.

1:43:23.680 --> 1:43:26.880
 And then there's that expression, all writing is editing.

1:43:26.880 --> 1:43:29.120
 So for the White Pills specifically,

1:43:29.120 --> 1:43:32.000
 this is, I don't know if it's the most ambitious book

1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:34.160
 I've ever done, your reader I think is more ambitious

1:43:34.160 --> 1:43:36.240
 because that's all of North Korea's history

1:43:36.240 --> 1:43:37.440
 and it's written in somebody else's voice,

1:43:37.440 --> 1:43:38.720
 not a person's abortion.

1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:41.280
 And you, like you mentioned, you had to read

1:43:41.280 --> 1:43:42.240
 a giant number of books.

1:43:42.240 --> 1:43:44.320
 Yeah, 60 books as research, yeah.

1:43:44.320 --> 1:43:45.840
 Well, maybe can we just pause,

1:43:45.840 --> 1:43:47.520
 can you say what White Pill is about?

1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:52.240
 Sure, it's about hope and it's a tale of good and evil.

1:43:52.240 --> 1:43:54.800
 And I think that's, I don't want to tip my hand too much,

1:43:55.600 --> 1:43:57.600
 but people are always like, how do you think,

1:43:57.600 --> 1:43:58.960
 why are you so hopeful?

1:43:58.960 --> 1:44:00.640
 And I'm not hopeful on an emotional level,

1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:03.040
 I'm hopeful because looking at history,

1:44:03.040 --> 1:44:04.640
 I think there's certain things that

1:44:06.720 --> 1:44:08.400
 not will certainly happen again,

1:44:08.400 --> 1:44:10.400
 but it's not at all implausible to happen again

1:44:10.400 --> 1:44:12.320
 and that the good guys will win.

1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:14.000
 And this is one of those cases.

1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:19.440
 So, the book took on a life of its own,

1:44:19.440 --> 1:44:21.440
 it's very different from how I originally conceived it.

1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:24.320
 I originally conceived it as a kind of retelling

1:44:24.320 --> 1:44:27.600
 of Camus philosophy, Ryan Holiday,

1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:29.520
 who he used to be close friends with,

1:44:29.520 --> 1:44:30.480
 I've talked to him in a while.

1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:32.240
 He has a whole kind of cottage industry

1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:33.840
 based on the Stoics of the past.

1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:35.280
 I'm like, okay, I asked him once,

1:44:35.280 --> 1:44:36.080
 can I do this with Camus?

1:44:36.080 --> 1:44:36.640
 He said, sure.

1:44:37.440 --> 1:44:40.160
 And then I reread Camus recently

1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:43.120
 and it wasn't what I had remembered.

1:44:43.120 --> 1:44:45.760
 I was like, Camus wasn't that, I apologize to interrupt.

1:44:45.760 --> 1:44:47.120
 So, it's interesting.

1:44:47.120 --> 1:44:49.280
 So, he kind of took ideas from Stoics

1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:54.000
 and started to kind of use it as a book

1:44:54.880 --> 1:44:56.800
 that gives you advice about how to live life

1:44:56.800 --> 1:44:58.400
 from the Stoic perspectives.

1:44:58.400 --> 1:45:00.080
 And you were thinking,

1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:03.440
 is there something in existentialism, absurdism,

1:45:03.440 --> 1:45:06.880
 or something specifically in Camus thinking,

1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:09.840
 or I think you've mentioned Mithos Sisyphus,

1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:11.840
 specifically like his philosophical work.

1:45:11.840 --> 1:45:14.240
 So, you were trying to see like,

1:45:14.240 --> 1:45:15.840
 is there, can I resurrect this?

1:45:15.840 --> 1:45:19.760
 That's actually, I would think,

1:45:20.400 --> 1:45:21.840
 that's an interesting project.

1:45:22.640 --> 1:45:28.640
 And it's sad to hear that it didn't materialize

1:45:28.640 --> 1:45:31.520
 in exactly that form,

1:45:31.520 --> 1:45:33.680
 because I thought there would be a lot in that.

1:45:33.680 --> 1:45:35.360
 So, I had Douglas Murray on my show

1:45:35.360 --> 1:45:36.400
 and he also made the point,

1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:37.680
 like when you go back and read Camus,

1:45:37.680 --> 1:45:38.800
 there's not that much there.

1:45:38.800 --> 1:45:42.720
 The myth of Sisyphus is not at all how I remembered it.

1:45:43.360 --> 1:45:46.800
 The vast bulk of that book is like literary criticism.

1:45:46.800 --> 1:45:48.080
 So, he's talking about Dostoevsky

1:45:48.080 --> 1:45:48.720
 and all these different people

1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:50.240
 who are embodiments of the absurd,

1:45:50.240 --> 1:45:52.960
 but I'm like, there's not much to take from here.

1:45:52.960 --> 1:45:55.280
 The actual title essay is basically

1:45:55.280 --> 1:45:59.360
 like a six chapter essay at the back of the book,

1:45:59.360 --> 1:46:02.400
 which it's good for what it is,

1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:04.320
 but there's not that much there to draw.

1:46:04.320 --> 1:46:07.840
 I'm extremely, he's a great hero of mine.

1:46:07.840 --> 1:46:10.800
 I think his life is just enormously admirable.

1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:13.600
 He fought very hard against the Nazi occupation.

1:46:14.240 --> 1:46:16.640
 His book, The Plague, which I find unreadable

1:46:16.640 --> 1:46:19.920
 is an allegory about Germany conquering France

1:46:19.920 --> 1:46:20.720
 and so on and so forth.

1:46:20.720 --> 1:46:23.680
 Wait a minute, why is The Plague unreadable?

1:46:23.680 --> 1:46:25.680
 It's the kind of book where reading the book

1:46:25.680 --> 1:46:27.520
 doesn't add anything to the plot.

1:46:27.520 --> 1:46:30.960
 The plot is a plague comes, sleeps over the town,

1:46:31.520 --> 1:46:34.000
 destroys a lot of life and vanishes quickly as it came.

1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:35.440
 You don't need to read the book now.

1:46:35.440 --> 1:46:36.080
 You get the point.

1:46:36.080 --> 1:46:38.880
 I deeply disagree with you.

1:46:38.880 --> 1:46:40.960
 Yes, of course I've read The Plague.

1:46:40.960 --> 1:46:42.720
 To me, The Plague is about the doctor

1:46:43.520 --> 1:46:47.920
 and it's about love and it's about the different roles

1:46:47.920 --> 1:46:53.760
 that humans take in a time of tragedy like The Plague.

1:46:53.760 --> 1:46:56.720
 Also, it's an allegory, so you could start to think about

1:46:58.400 --> 1:47:00.480
 whether it's Nazi Germany, whatever you think that is.

1:47:01.920 --> 1:47:06.640
 To me, that was about love and about the highest ideal

1:47:06.640 --> 1:47:09.600
 being the doctor that sacrifices themselves for others

1:47:10.640 --> 1:47:12.640
 and still has love and hope.

1:47:12.640 --> 1:47:16.720
 I mean, to me, the way that story is told,

1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:19.040
 I think, has a lot of meaning.

1:47:19.040 --> 1:47:22.000
 It's like, to me, you saying that's interesting.

1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:24.560
 You say it this way, but to me, it's like saying

1:47:24.560 --> 1:47:27.680
 Animal Farm doesn't need to be read

1:47:28.640 --> 1:47:31.280
 because it's an obvious story.

1:47:31.280 --> 1:47:33.280
 I don't think there's much plot to The Plague.

1:47:34.240 --> 1:47:36.160
 I think Animal Farm has a very long plot

1:47:37.440 --> 1:47:38.800
 and a complex plot.

1:47:38.800 --> 1:47:41.440
 But there's experiences within.

1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:44.000
 So the situation is set up in The Plague

1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:47.600
 and there's experiences that start to reveal a philosophy.

1:47:48.480 --> 1:47:51.440
 So yeah, it's not very plot driven.

1:47:53.360 --> 1:47:55.760
 So I would say you still should read it,

1:47:56.560 --> 1:47:58.160
 but The Plague doesn't...

1:47:58.160 --> 1:48:00.480
 Like you didn't give away anything currently.

1:48:03.280 --> 1:48:04.400
 Some books are just...

1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:07.680
 I mean, Ayn Rand is similar to that in the sense

1:48:07.680 --> 1:48:09.840
 like The Plague is not as important

1:48:09.840 --> 1:48:12.880
 as the behavior of the different people in that plot.

1:48:12.880 --> 1:48:14.480
 I think she's very plot heavy.

1:48:15.120 --> 1:48:16.720
 No, she has plot, but I'm saying

1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:19.120
 that's not necessarily the important thing.

1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:21.600
 To me, the behavior of the people is the important thing.

1:48:23.200 --> 1:48:26.320
 You could like separate it into a bunch of blog posts

1:48:26.320 --> 1:48:27.520
 and they stand on their own.

1:48:28.160 --> 1:48:30.960
 I would have to think about that with Ayn Rand.

1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:34.880
 She does, through the plot, create a world

1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:37.360
 where you start to understand the different values

1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:40.160
 that people have, but yeah.

1:48:40.160 --> 1:48:43.120
 Yeah, but that's what the plot serves.

1:48:44.320 --> 1:48:46.160
 Yeah, I would have to think.

1:48:46.160 --> 1:48:48.160
 But in The Plague, it's the behavior of the people

1:48:48.160 --> 1:48:49.280
 that's really important.

1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:51.920
 And the same, I mean, The Stranger too.

1:48:51.920 --> 1:48:52.720
 I mean, these like...

1:48:55.520 --> 1:48:57.360
 I'm trying to scramble here for books

1:48:57.360 --> 1:48:59.680
 I really appreciate that don't have a plot.

1:48:59.680 --> 1:49:04.000
 I mean, Notes from Underground.

1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:07.200
 So obviously, Dostoevsky has a huge amount of plot

1:49:07.200 --> 1:49:09.360
 in most of his work.

1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:11.760
 Hermann Hesse has a huge amount of plot.

1:49:11.760 --> 1:49:13.040
 Thomas Mann doesn't have the plot.

1:49:13.040 --> 1:49:14.240
 He's the one who doesn't have plots.

1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:15.280
 Thomas Mann.

1:49:15.280 --> 1:49:16.880
 Would you say Kafka has a plot?

1:49:17.440 --> 1:49:19.920
 I think Kafka's very heavy plot driven.

1:49:19.920 --> 1:49:21.680
 Yeah, but I just don't see that, I guess.

1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:23.440
 I guess Metamorphosis doesn't really have a plot.

1:49:25.040 --> 1:49:27.280
 Yeah, but there's like crawling around.

1:49:27.280 --> 1:49:28.240
 But it's like a vignette.

1:49:28.240 --> 1:49:29.440
 It's not really like this.

1:49:29.440 --> 1:49:30.160
 It's not short, yeah.

1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:30.720
 Yeah.

1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:34.720
 A Hunger Artist, one of my probably favorite short stories

1:49:34.720 --> 1:49:35.840
 is that kind of a short story.

1:49:35.840 --> 1:49:38.480
 It's a pretty long short story of Kafka's.

1:49:38.480 --> 1:49:39.280
 It's really interesting.

1:49:40.240 --> 1:49:41.360
 It's about a man.

1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:42.400
 I don't know if you read it.

1:49:42.400 --> 1:49:43.040
 No, I don't think so.

1:49:43.920 --> 1:49:48.160
 It's about a man that is like a freak in a sense

1:49:48.160 --> 1:49:53.200
 that his skill is that he can fast for a long time.

1:49:53.200 --> 1:49:53.520
 Okay.

1:49:53.520 --> 1:49:55.040
 And then people gather on the cage

1:49:55.040 --> 1:49:57.520
 and look at him as he fasts.

1:49:57.520 --> 1:49:59.280
 I don't actually remember if he's in a cage or not.

1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:03.200
 And eventually, he fasts so long

1:50:03.200 --> 1:50:04.880
 that people don't even care anymore.

1:50:04.880 --> 1:50:06.000
 Like they just leave.

1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:11.200
 So there's a, it has to do something.

1:50:11.200 --> 1:50:15.040
 It makes me think about like, don't become,

1:50:15.040 --> 1:50:19.280
 the way you live, don't become like a freak show,

1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:20.240
 a circus act.

1:50:20.800 --> 1:50:25.920
 Like live for an ideal, live for something that brings you joy.

1:50:25.920 --> 1:50:27.680
 Or don't live for the sake of attention.

1:50:27.680 --> 1:50:28.640
 For the sake of attention.

1:50:28.640 --> 1:50:29.520
 Yeah, that's, yeah.

1:50:30.880 --> 1:50:34.080
 Yeah, anyway, so I rudely interrupted

1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:36.560
 because you were talking about the plague and connecting it

1:50:36.560 --> 1:50:39.200
 to the writing process of White Pill.

1:50:39.200 --> 1:50:39.440
 Yeah.

1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:43.040
 Well, anyway, so how I was writing this one,

1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:46.560
 I just had a first draft of notes

1:50:46.560 --> 1:50:48.800
 and it's not in chronological order.

1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:50.960
 It's like, I read certain books as research

1:50:50.960 --> 1:50:53.360
 and then I had the pull quotes that was necessary there.

1:50:54.400 --> 1:50:57.280
 And now I'm basically rearranging everything and putting it.

1:50:57.280 --> 1:51:00.400
 So the book started as Ryan Holiday's.

1:51:01.040 --> 1:51:01.360
 Right.

1:51:01.360 --> 1:51:04.240
 The equivalent of Ryan Holiday as Camus, the working title would have been

1:51:04.240 --> 1:51:06.880
 The Point of Tears because this is great.

1:51:06.880 --> 1:51:11.520
 Camus is a great quote maker and he has this line about

1:51:11.520 --> 1:51:13.360
 man must live, live to the point of tears,

1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:19.440
 which I think is just what I love about him is Camus,

1:51:19.440 --> 1:51:22.480
 he always comes off as like he's clenching his teeth.

1:51:22.480 --> 1:51:26.080
 He's clenching his teeth both in terms of like

1:51:26.080 --> 1:51:29.200
 barely mitigated rage and injustice.

1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:32.960
 Like when he sees people suffering, it just really makes him like

1:51:32.960 --> 1:51:34.160
 just upset to the core.

1:51:34.800 --> 1:51:40.480
 But also this sense of not taking life for granted

1:51:41.120 --> 1:51:44.160
 and kind of just pushing yourself and pushing the boundaries.

1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:48.080
 And his point being that life is inherently meaningless,

1:51:48.080 --> 1:51:50.400
 which gives a great opportunity to impute meaning to it

1:51:51.200 --> 1:51:53.200
 to create our own meaning to life.

1:51:53.200 --> 1:51:56.000
 So taking the main essay from Sisyphus,

1:51:56.000 --> 1:52:00.240
 myth of Sisyphus, that was the origin story for the white pill,

1:52:00.240 --> 1:52:02.000
 but then it became something completely different.

1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:05.600
 Yeah. And so then it became, how are you so optimistic

1:52:05.600 --> 1:52:07.360
 in the face of everything that's going on in the world?

1:52:07.360 --> 1:52:09.920
 And I started writing it when COVID started hitting.

1:52:10.480 --> 1:52:14.000
 And I, because again, I'm not optimistic

1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:16.480
 because of some temperament of mine.

1:52:16.480 --> 1:52:19.840
 I'm optimistic because, you know, people talk about how

1:52:19.840 --> 1:52:23.680
 if the US didn't exist, China would just become an empire

1:52:23.680 --> 1:52:24.720
 and take over everything.

1:52:24.720 --> 1:52:30.160
 Empires are expensive and look at the British empire,

1:52:30.160 --> 1:52:31.760
 you know, look at the Soviet Union.

1:52:31.760 --> 1:52:34.880
 Like it's not automatically sustainable.

1:52:34.880 --> 1:52:40.800
 It costs a lot of things to make sure when you're geographically,

1:52:40.800 --> 1:52:43.760
 you know, all over the world, literally,

1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:44.880
 to keep everyone in line.

1:52:44.880 --> 1:52:47.520
 It's not at all like a super villain movie.

1:52:47.520 --> 1:52:50.080
 Like once it happens, it's the happy ending for them.

1:52:50.080 --> 1:52:53.280
 So yeah, that was the start.

1:52:53.280 --> 1:52:57.840
 And I'm like, all right, let me tell, one thing I'm good at

1:52:57.840 --> 1:52:58.960
 is telling stories.

1:52:58.960 --> 1:53:00.400
 So this is really a...

1:53:00.400 --> 1:53:03.200
 So this is narrative, plot driven.

1:53:03.200 --> 1:53:06.560
 Very, very plot driven and also heavily character driven,

1:53:06.560 --> 1:53:07.600
 but the characters are real.

1:53:08.320 --> 1:53:09.600
 Yeah. Got it.

1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:14.080
 So it's interesting to kind of mention what kind of,

1:53:14.080 --> 1:53:16.560
 what does the first draft kind of look like in terms of,

1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:19.360
 what kind of things do you plop down?

1:53:19.360 --> 1:53:22.080
 Oh, so it'll be like, let's suppose I just read a,

1:53:22.080 --> 1:53:24.400
 like, you know, some book called The Guillotine at Work,

1:53:24.400 --> 1:53:26.880
 which was an early book attacking Lenin

1:53:26.880 --> 1:53:29.040
 from the anarcho communist perspective.

1:53:29.040 --> 1:53:30.720
 So it'll just be like all the different quotes,

1:53:30.720 --> 1:53:33.200
 like a paragraph here, double space, another paragraph,

1:53:33.200 --> 1:53:36.160
 you know, blah, blah, blah, so on and so forth.

1:53:36.160 --> 1:53:39.440
 Whereas for other sections where I wasn't just using

1:53:39.440 --> 1:53:42.240
 the book as research, there would be like talking

1:53:42.240 --> 1:53:43.760
 about McKinley getting shot.

1:53:43.760 --> 1:53:46.720
 Like it's just me writing the narrative and that I could just

1:53:46.720 --> 1:53:49.040
 pretty much copy paste into the second draft.

1:53:49.040 --> 1:53:52.960
 By way of advice, would you give that as advice?

1:53:52.960 --> 1:53:54.560
 Is that a good way to do it?

1:53:54.560 --> 1:53:56.720
 Or is that a very peculiar way your brain works?

1:53:56.720 --> 1:53:59.120
 No, so this is actually advice I feel comfortable giving

1:53:59.120 --> 1:54:00.480
 to people who are trying to write.

1:54:02.320 --> 1:54:04.720
 Because it's just like with the gym, right?

1:54:04.720 --> 1:54:08.640
 If you did seven sets, seven, excuse me, reps last week

1:54:08.640 --> 1:54:11.920
 and you did eight this week, it's psychologically motivating

1:54:11.920 --> 1:54:13.280
 because you're going the right direction

1:54:13.280 --> 1:54:14.960
 and the human mind extrapolates.

1:54:14.960 --> 1:54:19.520
 So make sure, tell yourself I'm gonna get a page done today

1:54:19.520 --> 1:54:22.400
 or two pages done, sit your ass down on the computer,

1:54:22.400 --> 1:54:24.800
 you're not allowed to get up till you get those two pages.

1:54:24.800 --> 1:54:26.640
 It doesn't matter if they look like garbage

1:54:26.640 --> 1:54:31.280
 because if you have a 300 page first draft and it's crap,

1:54:31.280 --> 1:54:33.120
 at least you have something to work with

1:54:33.120 --> 1:54:34.480
 and that's a big number.

1:54:34.480 --> 1:54:37.680
 So if you're gonna, the thing is, since the first draft

1:54:37.680 --> 1:54:40.560
 is gonna be crap, if you're editing as you write,

1:54:40.560 --> 1:54:42.240
 it's gonna be extremely discouraging.

1:54:42.240 --> 1:54:45.360
 And it's also trying to drive and doing reverse

1:54:45.360 --> 1:54:46.160
 at the same time.

1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:48.800
 It's a completely nonsensical way to do it.

1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:51.280
 Get it all out there, don't look it over.

1:54:51.280 --> 1:54:52.880
 If you have a great line, put it in your phone

1:54:52.880 --> 1:54:57.200
 and then add it to the draft so it'll be a complete slog.

1:54:57.200 --> 1:54:59.120
 But editing that slog is gonna be a lot easier

1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:00.320
 than creating it to begin with.

1:55:00.320 --> 1:55:03.280
 And when you see those disparate lines all laid out

1:55:03.280 --> 1:55:07.200
 on the page, how difficult is it to then start

1:55:07.200 --> 1:55:08.000
 stitching it together?

1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:11.920
 Do you find that when you look at a list of those things

1:55:11.920 --> 1:55:15.120
 the final product will look very different

1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:17.360
 or will you actually use those lines?

1:55:17.360 --> 1:55:18.640
 No, I will use those lines.

1:55:18.640 --> 1:55:20.640
 Then I have a file called scraps.

1:55:20.640 --> 1:55:22.160
 So like if the line's no longer used,

1:55:22.160 --> 1:55:23.200
 I put it in my scrap pile.

1:55:24.320 --> 1:55:26.160
 I'd love to see what's in the scrap pile.

1:55:26.160 --> 1:55:26.880
 Okay, yeah, sure.

1:55:28.160 --> 1:55:29.760
 One of the things I've been pulling scraps

1:55:29.760 --> 1:55:31.920
 is a lot of times when I was earlier writing,

1:55:32.480 --> 1:55:34.560
 I would have contemporary references

1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:40.480
 and I realized that that's bad because I want the reader

1:55:40.480 --> 1:55:43.040
 to be in the past as the present.

1:55:43.040 --> 1:55:45.440
 So if you're talking about let's say 1901

1:55:45.440 --> 1:55:46.640
 and then you're referring to Obama,

1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:48.800
 that screws people up so I had to pull all those.

1:55:50.320 --> 1:55:52.640
 Okay, let's talk about some New Year's resolutions.

1:55:53.360 --> 1:55:55.040
 Do you ever do New Year's resolutions?

1:55:55.040 --> 1:55:57.360
 Do you ever think like that, like take a special day

1:55:58.400 --> 1:56:01.040
 in the year to think about how you're gonna try

1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:03.840
 to change yourself or do you try to transform yourself

1:56:03.840 --> 1:56:05.120
 every single day when you wake up?

1:56:05.920 --> 1:56:08.800
 Well, I usually have several projects I'm working on at once

1:56:08.800 --> 1:56:10.640
 so there's always incremental progress in those.

1:56:12.160 --> 1:56:13.360
 You know, it's nice to have a deadline

1:56:13.360 --> 1:56:17.920
 but at the end of 2022, I'll accomplish this,

1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:21.360
 kind of like to hold yourself responsible

1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:23.840
 and then you could do that at the beginning of the year

1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:26.560
 to think about that, both philosophically

1:56:26.560 --> 1:56:31.120
 like what kind of big, not projects that you can quantify

1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:33.120
 but more like how can I change my life

1:56:33.120 --> 1:56:35.760
 or like I mentioned, take the leap of different kinds

1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:39.280
 and then there's specific things like finish the book.

1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:44.400
 I, years ago and I'm, I think on some level,

1:56:44.400 --> 1:56:46.560
 you much less than me but I think you're increasing

1:56:46.560 --> 1:56:49.440
 in this direction, I realized it's more,

1:56:49.440 --> 1:56:52.240
 I have to learn how to be a surfer and not a driver

1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:56.320
 because when you reach the level we're at in our careers

1:56:56.320 --> 1:56:59.840
 or in our place in the culture, a lot of this is luck

1:57:00.720 --> 1:57:04.320
 and a lot of this is just like I'm just going along

1:57:04.320 --> 1:57:07.520
 for the ride because it's kind of counterintuitive

1:57:07.520 --> 1:57:10.160
 like the success of the Anarchist Handbook

1:57:10.160 --> 1:57:11.120
 was counterintuitive.

1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:17.760
 So all I'm hoping for is getting the book done.

1:57:18.400 --> 1:57:27.120
 I am extremely proud of it and just also building a,

1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:30.640
 we had Thanksgiving together at Blair's house,

1:57:30.640 --> 1:57:35.520
 just building a great upcoming community here in Austin

1:57:35.520 --> 1:57:38.400
 which has happened very quickly.

1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:42.800
 I was, there was gonna be another surprise here.

1:57:42.800 --> 1:57:45.840
 There's a girl named Natalie SideSurf

1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:48.240
 and she makes these ultra realistic cakes

1:57:48.240 --> 1:57:49.680
 like if you've seen those cakes online

1:57:49.680 --> 1:57:51.040
 where it looks like you're cutting a puppy,

1:57:51.040 --> 1:57:52.320
 like she makes those kinds of things.

1:57:52.320 --> 1:57:53.200
 So she's here.

1:57:54.080 --> 1:57:54.560
 In Austin?

1:57:54.560 --> 1:57:55.040
 Yeah.

1:57:55.040 --> 1:57:57.040
 Oh cool, like moved permanently?

1:57:57.040 --> 1:57:58.160
 I think she's been here for a while.

1:57:58.160 --> 1:58:01.280
 I haven't met her yet but I just kind of chatted with her.

1:58:01.280 --> 1:58:06.400
 So it's just so many, there's so many scenes happening here

1:58:07.520 --> 1:58:08.560
 that are overlapping.

1:58:09.440 --> 1:58:14.080
 So in general, finish the book, keep building a community.

1:58:14.080 --> 1:58:15.360
 You've already been doing that here.

1:58:15.360 --> 1:58:16.720
 You've been here several months.

1:58:16.720 --> 1:58:18.960
 I've been making a point to introduce people to each other

1:58:18.960 --> 1:58:20.960
 and everyone's just really getting along very well.

1:58:21.520 --> 1:58:24.400
 That's great and the book is the focus.

1:58:24.400 --> 1:58:25.840
 The book is the focus.

1:58:25.840 --> 1:58:28.400
 What about the podcast that you're doing?

1:58:28.400 --> 1:58:29.520
 You're welcome.

1:58:29.520 --> 1:58:33.360
 Yeah, I mean I enjoy it and it's been growing a lot.

1:58:33.360 --> 1:58:37.600
 I finally got a new computer which my friend Jay installed

1:58:37.600 --> 1:58:40.080
 so I can have a decent camera because of my old,

1:58:41.600 --> 1:58:43.760
 this is my mindset as a hoarder.

1:58:43.760 --> 1:58:47.120
 Like I was more interested in spending money

1:58:47.120 --> 1:58:49.520
 on a Pareto autograph than actually getting a computer

1:58:49.520 --> 1:58:52.240
 that's from the 20th century.

1:58:52.240 --> 1:58:59.280
 So, but I'm such an old school person in that in my head,

1:59:00.240 --> 1:59:02.000
 podcasts are like so ephemeral.

1:59:02.880 --> 1:59:06.080
 Like I don't, like there's some episodes of my podcast

1:59:06.080 --> 1:59:08.240
 that I'm really proud of and there's a lot of friendships

1:59:08.240 --> 1:59:10.240
 I've made as a result of it that really mean a lot to me.

1:59:10.240 --> 1:59:10.880
 No question.

1:59:10.880 --> 1:59:12.480
 It's made my life profoundly better place.

1:59:13.040 --> 1:59:15.760
 But it's not the same as that book on the shelf,

1:59:15.760 --> 1:59:19.760
 especially when the book is something that I think matters

1:59:19.760 --> 1:59:20.720
 much more than I do.

1:59:20.720 --> 1:59:22.080
 Yeah, there's a permanence to it.

1:59:22.080 --> 1:59:26.320
 There's a seriousness to laying down the words on paper,

1:59:26.320 --> 1:59:27.920
 like really giving them thought.

1:59:27.920 --> 1:59:30.320
 Yeah, that's true.

1:59:30.320 --> 1:59:32.480
 I mean, I'm a huge fan of podcasts.

1:59:32.480 --> 1:59:34.640
 You don't listen to podcasts much.

1:59:34.640 --> 1:59:35.920
 It's just fascinating to.

1:59:36.800 --> 1:59:38.080
 Yeah, like at all.

1:59:38.080 --> 1:59:39.920
 Like I don't know how mine is so successful.

1:59:39.920 --> 1:59:41.680
 Like it's just, yeah.

1:59:43.680 --> 1:59:45.840
 Yeah, yeah, I just love the medium.

1:59:45.840 --> 1:59:49.840
 Yeah, but I love the authenticity, the authenticity.

1:59:49.840 --> 1:59:52.640
 The realness of the medium.

1:59:52.640 --> 1:59:53.680
 That's really nice.

1:59:53.680 --> 1:59:56.640
 I just understood for the, it's starting to click

1:59:57.280 --> 2:00:00.640
 because like my pal Blair White, she was just on Rogan

2:00:01.360 --> 2:00:05.920
 and the first 10 minutes, I was so angry.

2:00:05.920 --> 2:00:08.560
 Like I was sitting there like yelling at the screen

2:00:08.560 --> 2:00:12.000
 because Joe and Blair, you would think that they're

2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:15.440
 going to start talking about Trump or trans issues

2:00:15.440 --> 2:00:16.720
 or moving to Austin.

2:00:16.720 --> 2:00:18.960
 They start talking about shark reproduction

2:00:18.960 --> 2:00:21.600
 and neither of these dumbasses knew anything about it.

2:00:21.600 --> 2:00:22.720
 I know a lot about it.

2:00:22.720 --> 2:00:23.920
 And they're like, oh, is it like this?

2:00:23.920 --> 2:00:24.880
 Or do the sharks lay eggs?

2:00:24.880 --> 2:00:25.760
 And I'm sitting there, I'm like,

2:00:25.760 --> 2:00:28.880
 if you don't know why you're talking about this, why?

2:00:28.880 --> 2:00:29.920
 Why are you talking?

2:00:29.920 --> 2:00:33.040
 And I could also see why people like these shows

2:00:33.040 --> 2:00:34.480
 because they feel like they're friends of the people.

2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:35.440
 Like they're sitting in the room

2:00:35.440 --> 2:00:36.560
 because I felt like it was in that room

2:00:36.560 --> 2:00:38.560
 and I wanted to shake both of them.

2:00:38.560 --> 2:00:39.600
 Yeah, in the room.

2:00:39.600 --> 2:00:41.520
 So no, what about transforming yourself

2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:43.680
 and your resolutions like that?

2:00:43.680 --> 2:00:46.400
 Oh, I'm doing a slight bulk now.

2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:48.560
 So I'm almost at my heaviest weight ever,

2:00:48.560 --> 2:00:50.320
 but I couldn't go to the gym this week

2:00:50.320 --> 2:00:51.840
 because I was a little under weather.

2:00:52.560 --> 2:00:54.080
 So that's been a little frustrating, but yeah.

2:00:54.960 --> 2:00:57.360
 So are we going to get some more modeling pics?

2:00:59.040 --> 2:01:00.240
 Is there goals there?

2:01:00.240 --> 2:01:03.200
 So my heaviest, I'm 4.8.

2:01:03.200 --> 2:01:05.600
 The heaviest I've ever been was when,

2:01:05.600 --> 2:01:06.720
 and this is when I was like.

2:01:06.720 --> 2:01:07.760
 He's exaggerating.

2:01:07.760 --> 2:01:08.800
 He's not that tall.

2:01:08.800 --> 2:01:09.520
 That's the metric.

2:01:10.800 --> 2:01:11.520
 Oh, sorry.

2:01:11.520 --> 2:01:13.200
 Are you talking about your height, 4.8?

2:01:13.200 --> 2:01:13.360
 Yeah.

2:01:14.400 --> 2:01:15.520
 Barely 4.6.

2:01:15.520 --> 2:01:19.440
 So the heaviest I've ever been when I was really high body fat

2:01:21.040 --> 2:01:22.400
 because I couldn't gain weight as a kid.

2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:24.080
 So when I figured out I could actually gain weight,

2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:27.360
 I was 164.5.

2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:31.360
 So I want to hit 165 and then take it from there.

2:01:31.360 --> 2:01:33.280
 I have a friend who's been helping me,

2:01:33.280 --> 2:01:35.760
 my buddy Trey Goff and this kid Stronger.

2:01:36.640 --> 2:01:38.720
 Jake, his username on Instagram is Stronger,

2:01:38.720 --> 2:01:42.640
 both the number five instead of letter S.

2:01:42.640 --> 2:01:46.640
 But he does, it looks like it's Photoshop,

2:01:46.640 --> 2:01:48.000
 like your brain can't process it.

2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:48.960
 You know the human flag?

2:01:50.320 --> 2:01:50.640
 No.

2:01:50.640 --> 2:01:51.520
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:01:51.520 --> 2:01:51.920
 Sorry.

2:01:51.920 --> 2:01:53.520
 He does human flag pushups.

2:01:55.280 --> 2:01:55.680
 Wow.

2:01:55.680 --> 2:01:58.560
 So he is parallel to the ground, right?

2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:00.640
 He's holding himself up like a flag,

2:02:00.640 --> 2:02:02.640
 but he could also do this while,

2:02:03.280 --> 2:02:05.600
 so he's moving parallel to the earth,

2:02:05.600 --> 2:02:08.320
 side to side while, it's just crazy.

2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:09.280
 That's really difficult.

2:02:09.280 --> 2:02:11.280
 So you're interested in that kind of stuff?

2:02:11.280 --> 2:02:13.520
 No, but I'm saying he's been helping me out,

2:02:13.520 --> 2:02:14.800
 so the guy knows what he's doing.

2:02:14.800 --> 2:02:16.160
 He's just a really impressive kid.

2:02:16.160 --> 2:02:18.320
 I love that kind of stuff, like bodyweight stuff.

2:02:18.320 --> 2:02:21.440
 So my primary mode of working out,

2:02:22.160 --> 2:02:24.400
 it's very like the, you ever seen Leon,

2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:27.440
 like the professional with Natalie Portman in that movie?

2:02:28.960 --> 2:02:31.840
 I have a pull up thing as you push up some pull ups.

2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:34.880
 It's very like, I'm just missing the milk.

2:02:34.880 --> 2:02:36.720
 I like working out at home just like that.

2:02:38.400 --> 2:02:40.480
 The bodyweight stuff, you can go so much with it.

2:02:40.480 --> 2:02:42.880
 And it's super functional for everything else you live in,

2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:45.360
 for life, for living life well.

2:02:46.640 --> 2:02:48.400
 On the other hand, I don't care about functionality.

2:02:48.400 --> 2:02:49.680
 The thing that really bothers me,

2:02:49.680 --> 2:02:52.640
 like I go, I know Joe's thinking of opening up a gym,

2:02:52.640 --> 2:02:53.360
 like a private gym.

2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:57.280
 There's only like one power cage here at the Gold's I go to.

2:02:58.320 --> 2:02:59.600
 I don't know what source that there's only one

2:02:59.600 --> 2:03:01.280
 or that sometimes people aren't using it.

2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:03.360
 I'm like, no one's doing deadlifts in here.

2:03:03.360 --> 2:03:05.360
 No one, just me, it's Gold's.

2:03:06.320 --> 2:03:08.400
 By the way, I don't want to say where,

2:03:08.400 --> 2:03:11.520
 I'll tell you off mic, but there's a few really

2:03:12.400 --> 2:03:14.720
 like ghetto places around Austin

2:03:14.720 --> 2:03:17.760
 that are just like these shitty gyms

2:03:17.760 --> 2:03:19.920
 that nobody wants to go to, but they have a rack.

2:03:19.920 --> 2:03:21.760
 They have like, if you want to lift heavy,

2:03:21.760 --> 2:03:22.240
 that kind of stuff.

2:03:22.240 --> 2:03:23.360
 But are they 24 hours?

2:03:23.360 --> 2:03:24.160
 That's the thing Gold's?

2:03:24.720 --> 2:03:28.080
 Oh, but there are 24 hours in the following way.

2:03:28.880 --> 2:03:30.160
 There's a code.

2:03:30.160 --> 2:03:30.640
 Okay.

2:03:30.640 --> 2:03:31.840
 And you just go in.

2:03:31.840 --> 2:03:32.320
 Okay.

2:03:32.320 --> 2:03:33.760
 And you turn on the lights.

2:03:33.760 --> 2:03:34.160
 That's fine.

2:03:34.160 --> 2:03:34.960
 And then you work out.

2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:36.880
 I don't want to meet people.

2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:39.120
 Exactly, well, that's just not true.

2:03:39.120 --> 2:03:40.720
 Sometimes there's people and they're great.

2:03:40.720 --> 2:03:42.880
 Yeah, and I've had fans come up to me at Gold's

2:03:42.880 --> 2:03:46.240
 and they've all been cool, except, except.

2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:47.840
 Oh no.

2:03:47.840 --> 2:03:48.480
 Except.

2:03:49.040 --> 2:03:49.540
 Except.

2:03:50.480 --> 2:03:54.720
 If I have my headphones on and I'm doing deadlifts,

2:03:55.360 --> 2:03:58.720
 I don't need you to come over, tap my ear,

2:03:58.720 --> 2:04:01.200
 and start giving me critiques about my form.

2:04:01.840 --> 2:04:02.960
 It's actually happened?

2:04:02.960 --> 2:04:03.460
 Yes.

2:04:03.460 --> 2:04:06.180
 Okay, I'm still angry about it.

2:04:07.780 --> 2:04:10.420
 I'm pulling my 150 in peace, thank you.

2:04:11.780 --> 2:04:13.060
 Yeah, people are hilarious.

2:04:13.060 --> 2:04:19.140
 I was recently in, had actually the wildest day ever in my life.

2:04:19.140 --> 2:04:21.540
 That was so many things happened in a row.

2:04:21.540 --> 2:04:24.340
 So I went to a wedding in LA.

2:04:24.340 --> 2:04:24.840
 Andrew?

2:04:25.300 --> 2:04:31.220
 Andrew Schultz's and with Whitney Cummings and Joe Rogan

2:04:31.220 --> 2:04:33.380
 and a bunch of other fascinating people.

2:04:33.380 --> 2:04:36.900
 It's just, speaking of weirdos, there's the comedian,

2:04:36.900 --> 2:04:39.300
 like the reason I find the comedians awesome,

2:04:39.300 --> 2:04:41.620
 one, they're authentic, they're just cool people.

2:04:41.620 --> 2:04:42.420
 Yeah, yeah.

2:04:42.420 --> 2:04:44.020
 But they're also just weird.

2:04:44.020 --> 2:04:47.300
 You don't become a comedian for not being like fucked up

2:04:47.300 --> 2:04:49.220
 in all kinds of different, interesting ways.

2:04:49.220 --> 2:04:50.500
 Anyway, so there's the wedding.

2:04:51.140 --> 2:04:55.300
 I'm, you know me, it was only carbs at the wedding.

2:04:55.300 --> 2:04:56.020
 So I didn't eat.

2:04:56.020 --> 2:04:57.460
 I didn't eat for a long time.

2:04:57.460 --> 2:05:01.220
 So I was like already fasted 20 hours, 25 hours.

2:05:02.420 --> 2:05:06.340
 So this whole story of everything that happens

2:05:06.340 --> 2:05:13.540
 is Lex like 40 hours fasted with Joe Rogan drinking a lot of whiskey.

2:05:13.540 --> 2:05:14.180
 And so.

2:05:14.180 --> 2:05:15.140
 You were drinking too?

2:05:15.140 --> 2:05:15.940
 Oh, heavy.

2:05:15.940 --> 2:05:17.380
 On 40, oh my God, that's crazy.

2:05:17.380 --> 2:05:18.660
 So it is calories.

2:05:18.660 --> 2:05:21.140
 That was my only source of calories is the whiskey.

2:05:21.140 --> 2:05:24.580
 And so I didn't trust myself with carbs when I'm drunk.

2:05:24.580 --> 2:05:27.380
 I just don't enjoy it because I'll forget.

2:05:27.380 --> 2:05:31.380
 And I just enjoy eating like a strict healthy diet when I'm drunk

2:05:31.380 --> 2:05:36.820
 because I'd rather eat more food that's healthy versus not.

2:05:36.820 --> 2:05:40.260
 And so anyway, so then we went to Vegas together

2:05:41.060 --> 2:05:45.300
 and then just kept doing wild thing after another wild thing.

2:05:46.260 --> 2:05:47.860
 Rogan opened up for Whitney Cummings.

2:05:48.420 --> 2:05:50.980
 He just like showed up at a random party that he wasn't invited.

2:05:50.980 --> 2:05:52.340
 And he did a thing.

2:05:52.340 --> 2:05:56.100
 He almost started a fight because some guy said stop spreading.

2:05:56.100 --> 2:05:58.420
 Yelled at him, said stop spreading misinformation.

2:06:00.420 --> 2:06:03.700
 And then we run into David Goggins out of all.

2:06:03.700 --> 2:06:04.980
 This is my first time meeting David.

2:06:05.620 --> 2:06:08.500
 I've talked to David a lot over the phone

2:06:08.500 --> 2:06:10.020
 and we were supposed to do a thing together.

2:06:10.020 --> 2:06:14.260
 And this is me trash out of my mind meeting David for the first time

2:06:14.260 --> 2:06:17.300
 with his incredible wife, Rogan's wife was there.

2:06:17.300 --> 2:06:20.260
 By the way, Joe Rogan's wife, David's wife

2:06:20.260 --> 2:06:23.620
 made me realize that I really want to be married

2:06:24.420 --> 2:06:32.020
 because they're not, they make their partners better.

2:06:32.020 --> 2:06:37.940
 Like that, I was, there's a certain aspect of marriage

2:06:37.940 --> 2:06:41.460
 that I'm afraid of that like your partner takes you away from life.

2:06:41.460 --> 2:06:43.140
 You don't get to experience life as much.

2:06:44.740 --> 2:06:47.140
 But this was like, they were enriching them.

2:06:47.140 --> 2:06:47.540
 I don't know.

2:06:47.540 --> 2:06:50.100
 It's like the world's most powerful support group.

2:06:50.100 --> 2:06:50.740
 It was cool.

2:06:50.740 --> 2:06:56.260
 Anyway, so then of course Drunk Lex challenges Goggins to pushups.

2:06:56.260 --> 2:06:57.860
 I saw this on Instagram, whatever it was.

2:06:57.860 --> 2:06:59.220
 So we're in the middle of the casino.

2:06:59.220 --> 2:07:00.500
 And you're in your suit.

2:07:00.500 --> 2:07:03.700
 In the suit, in the middle of casino, there's a crowd gathering.

2:07:04.820 --> 2:07:07.860
 Like it's Joe Rogan, me and David Goggins

2:07:07.860 --> 2:07:09.460
 and I'm just doing pushups with them.

2:07:09.460 --> 2:07:12.420
 And Rogan is like commentating and yelling and screaming.

2:07:12.420 --> 2:07:13.540
 It was surreal.

2:07:13.540 --> 2:07:17.380
 And just going on to the next thing and next thing and next thing like this

2:07:17.380 --> 2:07:22.660
 and then drove all the way from Vegas back to LA

2:07:23.220 --> 2:07:25.780
 with Joe and Whitney and his wife.

2:07:25.780 --> 2:07:28.180
 And it was like, what is this?

2:07:28.180 --> 2:07:30.100
 And all of it is done in 24 hours.

2:07:30.740 --> 2:07:36.420
 The one valuable lesson is don't fast and drink like excessively.

2:07:37.060 --> 2:07:43.460
 So I've learned that because what happens is liquor hits your mind,

2:07:43.460 --> 2:07:47.380
 my mind, sorry, I'll speak about my particular mind.

2:07:47.380 --> 2:07:51.780
 Like the intellectual part of my brain got hit really hard, really fast.

2:07:51.780 --> 2:07:56.020
 So I was not able to even more so than usual stitch together sentences.

2:07:56.020 --> 2:07:57.380
 I understood everything really well.

2:07:58.500 --> 2:07:59.780
 So like made you an immigrant again.

2:08:03.620 --> 2:08:06.100
 So like meeting David, I want to say so many things.

2:08:06.100 --> 2:08:07.940
 He's so inspiring to me, right?

2:08:07.940 --> 2:08:09.860
 But all I said was like, hello.

2:08:09.860 --> 2:08:16.020
 And I remember like opening my mouth to like try to say more.

2:08:16.020 --> 2:08:19.540
 And I was like, and then I would just close my mouth

2:08:19.540 --> 2:08:20.820
 and not be able to say anymore.

2:08:20.820 --> 2:08:23.940
 Yeah, this is one of the reasons I don't drink ever.

2:08:23.940 --> 2:08:28.340
 Yeah, it removes certain barriers.

2:08:28.340 --> 2:08:31.700
 Like it allows you to maybe have fun that you wouldn't otherwise.

2:08:31.700 --> 2:08:37.220
 But yeah, definitely for personal values, intellectual eloquence.

2:08:37.220 --> 2:08:39.140
 But I also hate being hungover.

2:08:39.140 --> 2:08:40.180
 The hungover part, yeah.

2:08:40.180 --> 2:08:40.820
 That's the worst.

2:08:40.820 --> 2:08:41.220
 Yeah, it's the worst.

2:08:41.220 --> 2:08:43.060
 And you also like, I did this to myself.

2:08:43.780 --> 2:08:44.280
 Yeah.

2:08:45.220 --> 2:08:47.700
 But it also teaches me that this too shall pass

2:08:48.580 --> 2:08:52.340
 because I've been hungover and I've quit drinking so many times in my life

2:08:52.980 --> 2:08:56.500
 that it makes you realize that all the unpleasant feelings,

2:08:57.060 --> 2:08:59.540
 all you have to do is just wait it out and it'll be fine.

2:08:59.540 --> 2:09:03.540
 It took me a long time to realize that that expression means the other thing.

2:09:04.340 --> 2:09:05.140
 What's the other thing?

2:09:05.140 --> 2:09:07.060
 If things are going great, this too shall pass.

2:09:07.940 --> 2:09:08.500
 Yeah.

2:09:08.500 --> 2:09:09.780
 Life of suffering.

2:09:09.780 --> 2:09:11.300
 No, I always thought about it as being more like,

2:09:11.300 --> 2:09:12.740
 don't worry if things are bad, it'll pass.

2:09:12.740 --> 2:09:15.940
 It's also like, if something's going great, it's not going to be this way forever.

2:09:16.900 --> 2:09:18.340
 It's like Bukowski said,

2:09:18.340 --> 2:09:21.620
 love is a fog that fades with the first daylight of reality.

2:09:24.980 --> 2:09:26.020
 Do you think love can last?

2:09:26.580 --> 2:09:27.780
 Oh yeah, we're going to win.

2:09:29.060 --> 2:09:29.940
 Who's we?

2:09:29.940 --> 2:09:30.500
 The good guys.

2:09:32.580 --> 2:09:34.740
 Didn't Hitler also think he's the good guys?

2:09:34.740 --> 2:09:35.240
 He's wrong.

2:09:36.660 --> 2:09:37.860
 Because you know why?

2:09:37.860 --> 2:09:38.260
 Why?

2:09:38.260 --> 2:09:38.740
 You need to win.

2:09:41.460 --> 2:09:43.060
 So you think it's permanent?

2:09:43.060 --> 2:09:46.900
 So this one time the good guys winning, it'll last.

2:09:47.540 --> 2:09:48.260
 It won't pass.

2:09:49.700 --> 2:09:52.420
 Because I think all of it passes, unfortunately.

2:09:52.980 --> 2:09:58.100
 I think we're going to win and win big in the Nazist future.

2:10:00.020 --> 2:10:02.100
 Do you have specific things in mind or no?

2:10:02.100 --> 2:10:06.580
 Or just a sense about human civilization, about society waking up?

2:10:06.580 --> 2:10:15.540
 I don't know about waking up, but I think the increased understanding on all sides of the

2:10:15.540 --> 2:10:24.980
 political spectrum that corporate America and corporate news outlets are self motivated actors

2:10:24.980 --> 2:10:30.900
 and those motivations are often inimical to what others would regard as desirable

2:10:31.460 --> 2:10:34.740
 is something that I think is happening with increasing frequency.

2:10:34.740 --> 2:10:38.820
 So what do you think about the political landscape in general?

2:10:38.820 --> 2:10:44.340
 You had a great conversation with Glenn Beck and he said that he talked to Trump and believes

2:10:44.340 --> 2:10:50.100
 that Donald Trump is definitely running in 2024 or very likely running in 2024.

2:10:50.820 --> 2:10:56.500
 I think he said he thinks he'll have a good chance of winning or I don't remember that,

2:10:56.500 --> 2:10:59.620
 but the fact that he was running was a surprise to you.

2:10:59.620 --> 2:11:03.300
 Do you think Donald Trump would be running in 2024?

2:11:03.300 --> 2:11:11.060
 Given that Glenn Beck has a much better relationship with Trump than I do, to put it mildly,

2:11:11.060 --> 2:11:15.300
 if Glenn Beck is certain this is going to happen, I would defer to Glenn Beck's judgment.

2:11:16.260 --> 2:11:18.660
 Do you think he has a chance of winning? Do you think he'll win?

2:11:18.660 --> 2:11:22.020
 Anyone in a binary political system who's the nominee has a chance.

2:11:22.020 --> 2:11:24.740
 Like whoever the Republican or Democrat has a chance.

2:11:24.740 --> 2:11:29.700
 I think also it's a lot easier to vote for someone that you have voted for in the past.

2:11:29.700 --> 2:11:33.780
 So that's why incumbents have a big advantage. There's not that psychological barrier to cover.

2:11:33.780 --> 2:11:41.060
 I think it's also useful for Trump that he's banished from social media because then he doesn't

2:11:41.060 --> 2:11:46.180
 have to have the responsibility of governing and all the costs of that, because no matter what

2:11:46.180 --> 2:11:48.500
 decisions you make while governing, some people aren't going to like that.

2:11:49.460 --> 2:11:55.140
 So he gets to kind of be above the radar or below the radar rather to some extent.

2:11:55.140 --> 2:12:00.900
 I don't think it's at all a given that he would get the nomination. When I say the good guys are

2:12:00.900 --> 2:12:06.020
 going to win, I certainly don't mean Donald Trump. I don't think victory is going to come

2:12:06.020 --> 2:12:07.620
 as a consequence of Washington.

2:12:07.620 --> 2:12:09.620
 You don't want to make America great again?

2:12:10.660 --> 2:12:14.180
 I think America is great. So do you don't...

2:12:14.180 --> 2:12:16.100
 This is my failed attempt at humor.

2:12:16.100 --> 2:12:21.460
 One of many. There are also hats that Giuliani and Jim Jeffords wore that said,

2:12:21.460 --> 2:12:26.660
 people can look this up. They said, because they were south of the border, make Mexico great again

2:12:26.660 --> 2:12:36.660
 also. Like that to me, it was like, just the syntax there.

2:12:38.660 --> 2:12:46.100
 Okay. So you don't even think you might get the nomination? Who else might?

2:12:46.100 --> 2:12:55.220
 I mean, if you had asked three years out who the nominee in 2020 would be,

2:12:55.220 --> 2:13:00.740
 Donald Trump wasn't even, or 2016 rather, wasn't even on the radar screen. So we have a long way

2:13:00.740 --> 2:13:01.220
 to go.

2:13:01.220 --> 2:13:04.020
 Even two years is a long way to go?

2:13:04.020 --> 2:13:09.220
 Yeah. Especially because we're coming out of COVID. There might be some governor who becomes

2:13:09.220 --> 2:13:15.700
 a rockstar for some reason. Maybe some congressman might have some big moment where they're screaming

2:13:15.700 --> 2:13:19.780
 at somebody and all of a sudden they become a rockstar in the Republican party.

2:13:19.780 --> 2:13:25.940
 Or it could be one of the celebrities we don't think about. I mean, Donald Trump is essentially

2:13:25.940 --> 2:13:33.860
 not a political figure before he ran. So it could be any of the famous right leaning

2:13:34.740 --> 2:13:40.420
 celebrities. I don't even know which way McConaughey leans.

2:13:40.420 --> 2:13:43.620
 No, I think he's a lefty or he's a Democrat, but he's not running.

2:13:43.620 --> 2:13:46.740
 But people like that just might step into the ring.

2:13:46.740 --> 2:13:50.180
 Yeah. I don't think they'd have that much of a chance because I think the Republican party,

2:13:50.180 --> 2:13:55.460
 there's an asymmetry. They'd be much more skeptical of an actor than the Democrats would be

2:13:55.460 --> 2:14:00.660
 because they would regard that actor as coming as a kind of mentoring candidate or whatever.

2:14:00.660 --> 2:14:04.740
 Right. But there's other kinds of celebrity, like Jocko could run as a Republican.

2:14:04.740 --> 2:14:05.860
 That's a good example. Yeah.

2:14:05.860 --> 2:14:08.900
 That would be interesting. So military person.

2:14:08.900 --> 2:14:14.100
 Right. Yeah. But already, for example, Dr. Oz is thinking of running for,

2:14:14.100 --> 2:14:18.260
 is going to run for the Senate in Pennsylvania. And there's already been a lot of research,

2:14:18.820 --> 2:14:23.620
 people slamming him on Twitter and social media for past positions he's taken. So

2:14:26.740 --> 2:14:30.100
 DeSantis is the figure of the moment, but Scott Walker was the figure of the moment

2:14:30.100 --> 2:14:32.580
 in the 2016 cycle and he didn't even make it to Iowa.

2:14:34.740 --> 2:14:38.660
 Yeah. And I wonder what role does COVID play in all of this?

2:14:38.660 --> 2:14:39.140
 Right.

2:14:39.140 --> 2:14:47.140
 In terms of, I'm mostly optimistic and hopeful about the world. Like when I look at the world,

2:14:47.140 --> 2:14:54.020
 I'm excited by most things. I've been a little bit or a lot disappointed by the lack of great

2:14:54.020 --> 2:15:02.500
 leadership in a time of trouble. Because to me, one of the great things about a difficult time

2:15:02.500 --> 2:15:08.660
 is it brings out the great leaders. Again, it's the up and down things. Like you don't want to

2:15:08.660 --> 2:15:16.260
 ask for war. You don't want to ask for pandemics, but when they happen, it's a great opportunity

2:15:16.260 --> 2:15:20.580
 for the human spirit to flourish. And the fact that it didn't quite in the way that I

2:15:20.580 --> 2:15:25.540
 hoped it would is disappointing. I think there's still time too, because people are trying to

2:15:25.540 --> 2:15:34.580
 figure out what to do as we emerge from the fog. Yeah. So I'm excited by 2024. Somebody said this

2:15:35.140 --> 2:15:41.460
 dark, cynical thing. I hope this is not true, but like that there was some doubt about the results

2:15:41.460 --> 2:15:51.460
 of the election in 2020, that in 2024, both sides, like it will just start becoming standard to

2:15:51.460 --> 2:15:57.620
 completely reject the results of an election no matter who wins. Well, that's my perspective. I

2:15:57.620 --> 2:16:02.340
 don't regard elections as legitimate. And I see what you're saying, not in the terms of that

2:16:02.340 --> 2:16:06.180
 basically the process itself was illegitimate. Yes. There's like cheating or something. Yeah.

2:16:06.180 --> 2:16:12.100
 But I think that that's pretty much a given. It has been a given. Like I see the Republicans

2:16:12.100 --> 2:16:16.900
 often say, oh, they got all these illegals to vote. Or the Democrats will say the voting machines

2:16:16.900 --> 2:16:22.660
 were hacked or the media, so on and so forth. Because despite all the people flapping their

2:16:22.660 --> 2:16:27.460
 gums about democracy, they only like democracy when it gives them the results that they want.

2:16:28.500 --> 2:16:32.260
 Can I ask you about something else that Glenn Beck said that I thought was really interesting?

2:16:32.260 --> 2:16:37.780
 Sure. I agree with him very much on this. And it was refreshing to hear, although he kind of made

2:16:37.780 --> 2:16:44.500
 it turn into a point about why Trump is great or whatever. But the point was the following,

2:16:44.500 --> 2:16:49.780
 which is he doesn't want to talk to anybody who can't say at least one nice thing about

2:16:51.300 --> 2:16:56.020
 everyone. So like, if you don't like Donald Trump, if you don't like Joe Biden,

2:16:57.300 --> 2:17:02.340
 you should still be able to say one nice thing, like legitimate nice, not just like a dismissive

2:17:02.340 --> 2:17:09.620
 nice thing, but legitimately say, what is one nice thing they did or like, or who they are as a person?

2:17:09.620 --> 2:17:15.700
 Not like saying Donald Trump is funny sometimes. Like no, like legitimate, where you really mean

2:17:15.700 --> 2:17:20.980
 it. And it's been really troubling to me how few people are able to do that about political figures.

2:17:21.540 --> 2:17:27.620
 I had a lot of people, I think I tweeted something like this leading up to the election,

2:17:28.180 --> 2:17:34.260
 saying like, you should be able to say something nice about both Joe Biden and Donald Trump. And

2:17:34.260 --> 2:17:43.860
 I've had old friends, I don't want to say specific, I guess, to call them out, but they, several

2:17:43.860 --> 2:17:48.340
 people, and one in particular, like wrote me this long, like several page email.

2:17:48.340 --> 2:17:49.380
 It was Sam?

2:17:49.380 --> 2:17:50.420
 It was Sam Harris.

2:17:50.420 --> 2:17:51.380
 Was it Sam Harris?

2:17:51.380 --> 2:17:59.700
 Sam Harris. No. But I have a lot of conversations with Sam Harris now and Joe on both sides. It's

2:17:59.700 --> 2:18:06.180
 like the devil and the angel on both my, I don't know which one is which, but they're both devils.

2:18:06.180 --> 2:18:08.580
 Different kinds of devils. Yeah, that's fair.

2:18:09.460 --> 2:18:16.020
 And they said, how could you say, how could you even consider like that there's something

2:18:16.020 --> 2:18:17.620
 positive about Donald Trump?

2:18:17.620 --> 2:18:24.100
 Yeah, here's an easy one. He has three wives with three kids with each, but the kids get along.

2:18:24.100 --> 2:18:29.300
 I think that's really commendable that Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and Barron can all get

2:18:29.300 --> 2:18:33.460
 along with each other, given the circumstances. I think that speaks to something as someone as a

2:18:33.460 --> 2:18:35.140
 father, Ivanka.

2:18:35.140 --> 2:18:40.740
 So on the family level, and I see the same thing with actually, one of the reasons I

2:18:41.620 --> 2:18:47.780
 always found Joe Biden fascinating is he's had a lot of really traumatic things happen in his life.

2:18:47.780 --> 2:18:48.280
 Yeah.

2:18:48.280 --> 2:18:55.400
 And if I shit my pants in front of the Pope, I'd be traumatized too.

2:18:57.400 --> 2:19:03.160
 I'm talking to a master troll about something sensitive and beautiful that is a man suffering

2:19:03.160 --> 2:19:03.880
 with a loss.

2:19:03.880 --> 2:19:06.440
 I kind of know what he feels like right now. I'm pretending to the Pope.

2:19:08.440 --> 2:19:14.040
 This chair is ruined. Sorry, Elon. You have to sit in it.

2:19:14.040 --> 2:19:17.160
 You have to sit in it.

2:19:17.160 --> 2:19:20.280
 Why is this chair full? I feel like I'm sitting in a swamp.

2:19:22.200 --> 2:19:26.600
 Lex, you have stuff to show. Can you afford a good chair? I'll send you one for Tesla.

2:19:26.600 --> 2:19:28.120
 That's a pretty good Elon impression.

2:19:30.200 --> 2:19:39.560
 But yeah, one criticism I told Joe, Rogan, he has trouble finding one positive thing to say about

2:19:39.560 --> 2:19:48.280
 Joe Biden, for example, and I just don't like that. I'm a big believer in the shit sandwich

2:19:49.240 --> 2:19:50.120
 sticking on topic.

2:19:50.120 --> 2:19:53.560
 Here's an easy one. I think Joe Biden clearly is a very amiable person.

2:19:54.440 --> 2:19:55.400
 What's amiable?

2:19:55.400 --> 2:19:58.920
 Gets along with people. It seems really clear that maybe before president,

2:19:58.920 --> 2:20:01.160
 because it's different when you're the president, but that he could call a lot

2:20:01.160 --> 2:20:04.440
 of these Republican senators, get them on the phone and have a conversation with them.

2:20:04.440 --> 2:20:06.280
 Yeah, and it's not some kind of manipulation.

2:20:06.280 --> 2:20:08.280
 To some extent it is because they're all politicians,

2:20:08.280 --> 2:20:13.080
 but he clearly seemed to be able to get, wasn't like an ideologue.

2:20:13.720 --> 2:20:18.120
 Yeah. Yeah. I mean, but there's, I mean, maybe I'm a sucker for that kind of thing,

2:20:18.120 --> 2:20:23.800
 but the blue collar thing, like riding the train, you know, there's ways to connect with people

2:20:23.800 --> 2:20:28.680
 and not seeing them as equals, no matter where their walks of life are.

2:20:28.680 --> 2:20:36.280
 And I love it when presidents do that to some degree because of the wealth under which Donald

2:20:36.280 --> 2:20:41.320
 Trump existed for a lot of his recent life. He's less able to do that quite naturally.

2:20:43.240 --> 2:20:44.920
 Maybe sometimes Obama wasn't quite able to do that.

2:20:44.920 --> 2:20:48.200
 That's a good question. Who's more blue collar, Trump or Biden?

2:20:48.200 --> 2:20:51.080
 And you can easily make the case for both, I think.

2:20:51.080 --> 2:20:56.760
 You could. No, not the blue collar, but like literally be able to fit in at a bar,

2:20:56.760 --> 2:20:58.280
 at a local bar and just like.

2:20:58.920 --> 2:20:59.880
 I can see both of them.

2:20:59.880 --> 2:21:01.560
 Yeah, you're right. I could see both of them.

2:21:01.560 --> 2:21:02.200
 Yeah.

2:21:02.200 --> 2:21:03.880
 In fact, Obama doesn't quite.

2:21:03.880 --> 2:21:05.240
 No, cause he's got that Ivy league thing.

2:21:05.240 --> 2:21:06.200
 Yeah, the Ivy league thing.

2:21:06.200 --> 2:21:06.700
 Yeah, yeah.

2:21:08.120 --> 2:21:09.320
 Yeah, you're right.

2:21:10.440 --> 2:21:12.040
 Somehow Donald Trump can too.

2:21:12.040 --> 2:21:15.000
 Oh, easily. Yeah, you can see him having a beer with the guys and yelling at the screen.

2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:17.240
 This is bullshit. Change the channel.

2:21:18.120 --> 2:21:23.560
 Yeah. I mean, I hope people do that. I think that's one of the most unpleasant things to me

2:21:23.560 --> 2:21:30.840
 is they're not able to empathize with the fact that half the country voted for another person.

2:21:30.840 --> 2:21:32.920
 Well, it's also then it's just a bad strategy.

2:21:32.920 --> 2:21:37.720
 If you can't figure out why half the country is voting for someone you guard as like a demon,

2:21:37.720 --> 2:21:39.960
 well then how are you going to supposed to fight this demon?

2:21:39.960 --> 2:21:42.680
 Like, you know, when I did your reader, the North Korea book,

2:21:42.680 --> 2:21:48.360
 it's like, don't you want to understand how these people get to where they got?

2:21:48.360 --> 2:21:50.120
 It's, no one's saying that he's a good person,

2:21:50.120 --> 2:21:52.760
 but like there's a logic to their, there's a method to their madness.

2:21:53.720 --> 2:21:56.200
 You've talked about national divorce a few times.

2:21:56.200 --> 2:22:00.120
 I've seen a couple of videos recently where you're responding to articles.

2:22:00.120 --> 2:22:06.680
 It's, it's kind of cool. Can you, can you talk about this idea of national divorce

2:22:07.240 --> 2:22:11.800
 and as it stands today, arguing for it, maybe, and if you could,

2:22:12.840 --> 2:22:17.080
 just out of curious in the context of those videos, if you can steal men and argument against.

2:22:18.440 --> 2:22:24.600
 So I was the first one to kind of bring this issue back into the national conversation.

2:22:24.600 --> 2:22:29.720
 I wrote a piece for Observer in 2016. Then Jesse Kelly had a piece a few months after that.

2:22:29.720 --> 2:22:33.800
 David Boyd just recently did a piece on his stuff stack earlier this year.

2:22:34.440 --> 2:22:41.080
 And it's become enough of a mainstreamed idea that paleontology outlets like the National Review

2:22:41.080 --> 2:22:45.960
 have felt the need to respond to them. So the point being that America has had at least two

2:22:45.960 --> 2:22:50.680
 cultures since the beginning and that there's absolutely no reason. And these cultures in

2:22:50.680 --> 2:22:55.960
 recent years, and this was in 2016, not mentioned 2021, have been increasingly antagonistic toward

2:22:55.960 --> 2:23:01.080
 one another and have even lost the ability to communicate. They're using language in different

2:23:01.080 --> 2:23:07.320
 ways and that there's no reason for this to continue any further. And, you know, just,

2:23:08.360 --> 2:23:13.640
 you live your life, we'll live ours and, you know, goodbye and good luck. There's no harm,

2:23:13.640 --> 2:23:20.120
 no ill will. Now there's lots of arguments against them. Some of those are, are completely,

2:23:20.120 --> 2:23:26.200
 I think, stupid. The stupidest one is, well, that's what China wants. Okay. Well, I mean,

2:23:26.200 --> 2:23:30.200
 I'm not going to live my life saying I'm just going to do the opposite of whatever China wants.

2:23:30.920 --> 2:23:35.400
 That's not logic. That's not a good pathway. Now, I'm not saying they're right or wrong,

2:23:35.400 --> 2:23:39.400
 but that's not a reason one way or another. Yeah. You bring up China or Russia, you know,

2:23:39.400 --> 2:23:45.960
 that's exactly what China or Russia want. But sort of the strong way to phrase that is

2:23:45.960 --> 2:23:58.920
 is it weakens America. Like not just the one America, but like both sides in the divorce

2:23:58.920 --> 2:24:05.320
 will be much weaker than they individually were together. So in that sense, not that you have to

2:24:06.120 --> 2:24:11.560
 care about what China thinks, but like it's a step, it's a big step backwards. Yes. I think

2:24:11.560 --> 2:24:15.640
 in the short term, it is absolutely a big step backwards in terms of power. There's no question

2:24:15.640 --> 2:24:20.200
 that when you're trying to reestablish a society, there's going to be a transition period. That

2:24:20.200 --> 2:24:24.760
 transition period is going to be costly. Each side starts wondering, wait a minute, why are we still

2:24:24.760 --> 2:24:27.960
 doing this? We don't have to anymore. We're not living with them, so on and so forth. So that's

2:24:27.960 --> 2:24:35.800
 going to be a concern. I don't think that the whole point of America or even a large or primary

2:24:35.800 --> 2:24:40.280
 point of America is to be a bulwark against Chinese power. And there's going to be very few

2:24:40.280 --> 2:24:47.320
 people on earth, given my work, who have as much informed hatred and contempt for the Chinese

2:24:47.320 --> 2:24:55.160
 government as I do. Certainly, next to the North Korean people, maybe the people from Eritrea,

2:24:55.160 --> 2:24:59.960
 there's few populations who I was worried about as the people under the rule of the Red Chinese.

2:25:00.520 --> 2:25:05.320
 My steel man argument is there's no way this is going to be peaceful because the lines don't

2:25:05.320 --> 2:25:11.240
 separate out well. So all you're doing is basically just replicating the problem because the disparity

2:25:11.240 --> 2:25:16.120
 isn't between during the Civil War, North and South, it's between New York City and upstate

2:25:16.120 --> 2:25:21.800
 New York or between Chicago, downstate Chicago. Once you get outside of LA and Sacramento,

2:25:22.760 --> 2:25:27.800
 California in many ways is like Kentucky, so it doesn't make sense. So that's a strong argument.

2:25:27.800 --> 2:25:32.200
 I mean, you've talked about that this process will be painful. It can be painful. And we're

2:25:32.200 --> 2:25:36.840
 not just talking about violence. It could be just, even the Civil War, you could divide it

2:25:37.560 --> 2:25:44.280
 somewhat cleanly. Obviously, the kind of national divorce you might be suggesting is that people are

2:25:44.280 --> 2:25:47.640
 living amongst each other. So you have to literally move. It's complicated.

2:25:47.800 --> 2:25:55.560
 Right. So that is a very strong argument. I think a cogent argument against it. Two is it's not just China,

2:25:55.560 --> 2:26:01.640
 it's that there's a lot of bad actors in the world who maybe aren't, like China certainly wants to carry

2:26:01.640 --> 2:26:07.880
 itself and have an appearance at least on the world stage as civilized and a leader. There's lots of

2:26:07.880 --> 2:26:13.240
 smaller countries who without us are going to feel comfortable doing some very nefarious things.

2:26:14.200 --> 2:26:18.440
 And they're not going to be scared of us anymore. And so that would be a bigger concern in many

2:26:18.440 --> 2:26:25.000
 regards than China. So I think that's a reasonable one. It could be that both sides, if this happens,

2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:30.280
 are going to, instead of work toward better, the things that make each side bad would get worse.

2:26:30.280 --> 2:26:35.560
 Yeah. And that's having those pushed towards the malevolent extremes is, I think, a very legitimate

2:26:35.560 --> 2:26:40.520
 criticism and a concern. I mean, as you suggested, there's no guarantee that won't happen.

2:26:40.520 --> 2:27:05.800
 Correct at all. Also, there's a, I think, a reasonable argument to make. So those are the

2:27:07.400 --> 2:27:09.320
 biggest ones, I would say.

2:27:09.320 --> 2:27:19.240
 And still, what is the case for national divorce and along which lines? So like in making the case

2:27:19.240 --> 2:27:24.920
 for national divorce, if it is desired, based on which kind of ideas do you think it should be

2:27:26.120 --> 2:27:26.840
 carried through?

2:27:26.840 --> 2:27:31.320
 Honestly, I don't know that it has to be idea based. Like for example, when Czechoslovakia

2:27:31.320 --> 2:27:40.360
 broke up, when Norway and Sweden broke up, it wasn't really ideological. It was more cultural. So

2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:45.240
 I always say divorce into two, but it would probably make more sense if it was like five,

2:27:46.200 --> 2:27:51.880
 because the Northeast, certainly New England, has their own culture. The West Coast has their own

2:27:51.880 --> 2:27:59.560
 kind of culture. I don't know. The thing is, in any kind of persuasion technique, right? Like once

2:27:59.560 --> 2:28:05.000
 people start, there's a difference between convincing someone they want to buy a car

2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:08.200
 and what features you want. So if you're at the point where we're arguing about the features,

2:28:08.200 --> 2:28:11.640
 then my work here is done. Do you know what I mean? Like I don't have a dog in the fight

2:28:11.640 --> 2:28:14.440
 in terms of what it's going to look like. I just want to get to the point where you're at least

2:28:14.440 --> 2:28:19.160
 considering seriously the idea of breaking up America. And I would encourage people to go look

2:28:19.160 --> 2:28:24.200
 at my article to see, which I'm sure the arguments still hold five years later.

2:28:24.200 --> 2:28:31.400
 Do you have a kind of vision of which of the two or which of the five, like do you actually have

2:28:31.400 --> 2:28:40.120
 specific cultures or ideas? I'll tell you exactly. If I told you, and everyone listening, in 2014,

2:28:40.920 --> 2:28:45.320
 we weren't that long ago, it was not long ago, which of these two things is more likely to happen?

2:28:46.040 --> 2:28:53.400
 2014. Texas secedes or declares secession from America or Donald Trump gets elected president.

2:28:53.400 --> 2:28:58.680
 Everyone's voting for Texas. Like in terms of prediction, which is more likely. So we had this

2:28:58.680 --> 2:29:02.840
 one. So it's not at all unlikely we're going to have this one. I don't know if that logic carries

2:29:02.840 --> 2:29:09.240
 through. You can't just say, here's an unlikely thing that happened, therefore anything can happen.

2:29:09.240 --> 2:29:12.440
 I just said, you just earlier said anything could happen this episode, didn't you?

2:29:12.440 --> 2:29:15.480
 Life is suffering. I wasn't listening to half the things you're saying.

2:29:15.480 --> 2:29:16.520
 You said it.

2:29:16.520 --> 2:29:17.160
 I said it.

2:29:17.160 --> 2:29:18.360
 Yes, you said anything could happen.

2:29:18.360 --> 2:29:22.520
 I'm definitely not here. I'm like you with podcasts. I do a podcast, but I don't listen to

2:29:22.520 --> 2:29:29.800
 it. That's why I'm talking. Okay. So yeah, it can happen. But in which, I guess I'm asking,

2:29:29.800 --> 2:29:30.840
 would you stay in Texas?

2:29:30.840 --> 2:29:33.640
 A hundred percent. And I'd run for office probably. It'd be fun.

2:29:35.400 --> 2:29:37.000
 I'm going to be the first president of Texas.

2:29:37.880 --> 2:29:45.560
 I attended a debate between Yaron Brooks and Yoram Hazony. I don't know if you know who that is.

2:29:45.560 --> 2:29:46.360
 The nationalist guy.

2:29:46.360 --> 2:29:49.000
 The nationalist, yeah. He wrote a book called The Virtue of Nationalism.

2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:50.040
 Yeah, I read that book.

2:29:50.040 --> 2:29:53.240
 And then I actually did a podcast with him. They did a debate.

2:29:53.800 --> 2:29:54.840
 Oh, they both run here?

2:29:54.840 --> 2:29:55.320
 Mm hmm.

2:29:55.320 --> 2:29:55.880
 Okay.

2:29:55.880 --> 2:30:01.160
 It was quite interesting. And I tried to wear my Michael Malice hat. So the...

2:30:01.160 --> 2:30:04.920
 You're wearing it now. You borrowed that from me.

2:30:04.920 --> 2:30:14.120
 Yeah. It's funny because the metaphor applies across all of these levels of collectivism.

2:30:14.120 --> 2:30:20.440
 So he was arguing for the power of nation. So he would be arguing against national divorce.

2:30:20.440 --> 2:30:26.360
 But he was also arguing for marriage, the power of actual marriage between individuals.

2:30:28.360 --> 2:30:34.040
 I think he's a conservative. What I really like about him is there's a clear philosophy

2:30:34.040 --> 2:30:40.280
 of conservatism that he expresses. And I think a lot of people get behind that philosophy.

2:30:40.280 --> 2:30:46.440
 Because to me conservatism and liberalism often is very kind of used loosely.

2:30:46.440 --> 2:30:46.840
 Yes.

2:30:46.840 --> 2:30:51.400
 He has a clear philosophy that he's expressing there and is grounded in tradition.

2:30:51.400 --> 2:30:56.520
 He has a lot of value in tradition. And so it's the thing you said about America.

2:30:57.160 --> 2:31:04.840
 Like one of the arguments against national divorce is like, listen, we've been at it for a while.

2:31:04.840 --> 2:31:08.920
 Like there is a lot of value in the fact that we've been at it for a while.

2:31:08.920 --> 2:31:13.320
 Don't just throw it all away all the time. So he says like philosophically, he seems

2:31:13.320 --> 2:31:20.040
 in a lot of walks of life, revolution should be avoided as much as possible.

2:31:20.040 --> 2:31:21.000
 I agree.

2:31:21.000 --> 2:31:26.520
 And so it's kind of interesting. So he makes the case that there's something fundamentally

2:31:26.520 --> 2:31:33.960
 powerful about the nation. That it's a nice way to group a culture.

2:31:33.960 --> 2:31:39.880
 And so the national divorce, I guess, goes against that. I mean, do you find some aspect

2:31:39.880 --> 2:31:43.880
 of the virtue of nationalism, as you will put it, powerful?

2:31:44.840 --> 2:31:47.720
 Well, powerful in a good sense.

2:31:47.720 --> 2:31:51.960
 In a good sense. So sorry, yeah, in a good sense, like it brings out the best in humans.

2:31:51.960 --> 2:31:55.080
 I don't know about the best, but it certainly brings out good things. I have that line I

2:31:55.080 --> 2:31:58.360
 always say about I love my country. I hate the government because I love my country.

2:31:58.360 --> 2:32:00.840
 Yeah. So there is a love of country.

2:32:00.840 --> 2:32:06.040
 I think it's, but I don't know that that's the, I think it's also the case because the

2:32:06.040 --> 2:32:11.080
 country happens to be America. Like, I don't know if I was living in, you know, whatever,

2:32:11.080 --> 2:32:15.960
 I don't want to insult someone's country. Canada, yeah. If I was living in Canada, I

2:32:15.960 --> 2:32:17.080
 don't know that it'd be the Ochoa Patriot.

2:32:17.080 --> 2:32:20.360
 This is a guy who calls basically every other country shithole country.

2:32:20.360 --> 2:32:25.240
 Yeah, that's true. That's the fact. Yeah. So it's either, you're either, there's two

2:32:25.240 --> 2:32:27.160
 types of countries, Texas or shitholes.

2:32:27.160 --> 2:32:32.520
 Oh, wow. You went full Texas. So you're okay burning the Northeast to the ground at this

2:32:32.520 --> 2:32:33.080
 point.

2:32:33.560 --> 2:32:39.080
 Okay. I'm hoping for it. What they've done to New York City, I will never forgive these

2:32:39.080 --> 2:32:45.240
 people. And I hope that they suffer enormously consequences for what they've done to New

2:32:45.240 --> 2:32:52.520
 York. It's unconscionable, the assault that they've done and no remorse over how many

2:32:52.520 --> 2:32:57.320
 creative outlets that they've destroyed.

2:32:57.320 --> 2:32:59.640
 Yeah, it's the cultural hub, cultural center of the world.

2:33:01.160 --> 2:33:07.080
 New York was the, this was the place where you go to put up your shingle and move the

2:33:07.080 --> 2:33:12.440
 needle and make things happen. And I would understand if it was like, okay, we got to

2:33:12.440 --> 2:33:16.600
 suffer through this for a year, but we're going to make sure all these businesses have

2:33:16.600 --> 2:33:21.720
 a kind of safety net to make sure that they kind of get through and survive this, which

2:33:21.720 --> 2:33:26.200
 they did to the banks in 2008, for example. And I'm saying this as an anarchist and there

2:33:26.200 --> 2:33:33.320
 was none of that. So I burn it down and salt the earth. It's because it's like watching

2:33:33.320 --> 2:33:37.160
 like a zombie. It's unnatural. It's an abomination.

2:33:37.880 --> 2:33:42.840
 So I mean, sort of on the on the white pill side of things, I don't know about you, maybe

2:33:42.840 --> 2:33:48.680
 I have a sense that both Silicon Valley that for me personally, maybe I have the same intensity

2:33:48.680 --> 2:33:56.040
 of feelings you do about New York. It's just disappointing to see it be consumed with cynicism

2:33:56.040 --> 2:34:00.920
 and a lot of other paralyzing forces. But I still have hope for that place. I think

2:34:02.120 --> 2:34:11.720
 maybe it's the Yoram kind of tradition hope that through momentum, the strong reemerges.

2:34:11.720 --> 2:34:18.440
 So like I have hope for New York. I think New York will continue like not maybe on the

2:34:18.440 --> 2:34:24.680
 scale of years, but a scale of decades. It'll be ups and downs where it reemerges as a cultural

2:34:24.680 --> 2:34:30.280
 center. I just can't imagine a place like New York is like Paris. There's going to be

2:34:30.280 --> 2:34:33.800
 long stretches of time where it leads the world.

2:34:34.280 --> 2:34:36.600
 Paris has not been a cultural hub for a very long time.

2:34:36.600 --> 2:34:36.920
 Yeah.

2:34:36.920 --> 2:34:41.880
 You know, the days of Matisse and Picasso and Gertrude Stein are long gone.

2:34:44.680 --> 2:34:46.280
 It still is a hub.

2:34:46.280 --> 2:34:47.960
 Even London isn't London.

2:34:47.960 --> 2:34:48.200
 Yeah.

2:34:48.200 --> 2:34:50.120
 You know, you're not the...

2:34:50.120 --> 2:34:54.680
 But what is then? London is still London. Paris is still Paris. It's just not the Paris of

2:34:54.680 --> 2:35:01.560
 old. It's not London of old. London is still a place. It's a tech hub. It's a fashion hub.

2:35:01.560 --> 2:35:04.440
 It's a music hub. I mean, it's still a pretty strong hub.

2:35:04.440 --> 2:35:09.240
 Yeah, but not like during the Beatles era or during the Sex Pistols era.

2:35:09.240 --> 2:35:13.720
 But it could be just us romanticizing the past. Because what is a hub then?

2:35:13.720 --> 2:35:19.800
 No, it's not romanticizing the past because a hub is the place where everyone on earth

2:35:19.800 --> 2:35:25.320
 or our eyes are on you. So in the late 60s, in the mid 60s, you see the British Invasion,

2:35:25.320 --> 2:35:29.800
 you know, the Kinks and all these other bands coming out of Great Britain, like they were

2:35:29.800 --> 2:35:36.280
 the innovators. This was the place that was happening.

2:35:36.280 --> 2:35:37.080
 In that sense, like...

2:35:37.080 --> 2:35:38.840
 And Brooklyn, you know, 15 years ago.

2:35:41.400 --> 2:35:47.400
 But I guess maybe in that sense, in the 21st century, geographical hubs are becoming a

2:35:47.400 --> 2:35:53.160
 thing of the past. So like, you can be a hub in the digital space now. So like it's not,

2:35:53.160 --> 2:35:54.280
 maybe you'll never have...

2:35:54.280 --> 2:35:59.480
 I don't think... I think there will always be... I mean, what I'm saying, digital space

2:35:59.480 --> 2:36:03.880
 makes it easier for, let's suppose, Cleveland to be a hub. Because all you need is like

2:36:03.880 --> 2:36:07.720
 10 people who happen to live in Cleveland or, you know, Akron was a hub, a minor hub.

2:36:07.720 --> 2:36:12.520
 All it takes is 10 to 50 people to create a... Yeah, and maybe even less. Maybe it's

2:36:12.520 --> 2:36:15.160
 just two or three or four people.

2:36:15.160 --> 2:36:19.160
 I mean, there's been no shortage of articles talking about Austin and what's happening

2:36:19.160 --> 2:36:24.840
 here. And I know some of Joe's plans and you and I and Blair and all these other people

2:36:24.840 --> 2:36:28.520
 that we know. My buddy Andrew Heaton moved here. He's just one of the best people I know.

2:36:28.520 --> 2:36:30.200
 It's just, I'm really, really excited.

2:36:30.920 --> 2:36:33.240
 Can I ask you some weird thing about friendship?

2:36:33.240 --> 2:36:34.040
 Of course.

2:36:34.040 --> 2:36:37.880
 Because you mentioned Sam, he's Mr. Harris to you.

2:36:37.880 --> 2:36:44.520
 Didn't that bother you how he went after Joe? He's like, oh, in case you guys have brain

2:36:44.520 --> 2:36:48.360
 damage from watching Rogan's last episode, like watch, here's the answer. And it's just

2:36:48.360 --> 2:36:49.800
 like... Oh, like digs like that.

2:36:49.800 --> 2:36:51.240
 Yeah, yeah. I didn't like that.

2:36:51.240 --> 2:36:55.080
 I didn't like that either. I think Sam doesn't like it either about himself.

2:36:55.080 --> 2:36:55.480
 Okay.

2:36:56.440 --> 2:36:57.640
 He regrets those things.

2:36:57.640 --> 2:37:04.120
 Because it's very easy to say from his perspective, look, this isn't the full side. Rogan didn't

2:37:04.120 --> 2:37:07.720
 show you the full side of the story. Here's the other side of the story. Please watch

2:37:07.720 --> 2:37:09.800
 this and be informed. That's a very reasonable thing to say.

2:37:10.920 --> 2:37:16.520
 Yeah, I don't quite understand this. So they do this about each other now. I'll put three

2:37:16.520 --> 2:37:22.600
 people on the table, which is Joe Rogan, Sam Harris, and Brett Weinstein. And they have

2:37:22.600 --> 2:37:28.680
 a way of talking like the other person is creating a lot of harm. Like, publicly we'll

2:37:28.680 --> 2:37:35.560
 say things like that. And I understand there's emotion in it. But like, these are human beings

2:37:37.320 --> 2:37:39.480
 that are friends of yours.

2:37:39.480 --> 2:37:43.160
 But I'll go the other way. Let's suppose it is true that Joe's doing a lot of harm,

2:37:43.160 --> 2:37:49.000
 spreading misinformation. Being sarcastic isn't going to be persuasive. Whereas if you're

2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:55.480
 like, he's wrong, here's the facts, or be informed. To me, but then I'm not Sam Harris.

2:37:55.480 --> 2:37:58.200
 He's got a bigger audience than me, so maybe he's the one who's right and I'm wrong.

2:37:58.200 --> 2:37:59.960
 No, he's just human.

2:38:00.520 --> 2:38:01.480
 Okay, well, I can't relate.

2:38:02.280 --> 2:38:07.400
 Well, have you seen your Twitter lately? I mean, you have a lot of fun on Twitter. I

2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:08.840
 feel like Twitter lets...

2:38:08.840 --> 2:38:12.440
 I've never done that with someone I'm friends with. I never would.

2:38:13.640 --> 2:38:15.000
 Okay, let's put that on record.

2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:16.040
 It is on record.

2:38:16.040 --> 2:38:19.000
 Because if there's an issue with you, I'm getting you on the phone.

2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:21.080
 Yeah. Good.

2:38:21.080 --> 2:38:25.080
 Because then I'm not backing you into a corner publicly. It doesn't make any sense strategically.

2:38:25.080 --> 2:38:32.200
 Yeah, and actually, Brett Weinstein tweeted something sort of criticizing something, I

2:38:32.200 --> 2:38:36.600
 did already forgot what. But he texted me first saying like, is it okay if I tweet this?

2:38:36.600 --> 2:38:37.080
 Yeah.

2:38:37.080 --> 2:38:41.400
 And I said, yep. I was excited.

2:38:41.400 --> 2:38:41.640
 Yeah.

2:38:42.200 --> 2:38:47.160
 But I think there's some level of just be compassionate privately and be compassionate

2:38:47.160 --> 2:38:48.120
 publicly.

2:38:48.120 --> 2:38:49.320
 Or be civil.

2:38:50.280 --> 2:38:56.280
 Civil. For some reason, I don't like the word civility because it's polite.

2:38:56.280 --> 2:39:00.360
 Or be cordial, is that better?

2:39:00.360 --> 2:39:01.400
 No, what I mean is like...

2:39:02.760 --> 2:39:03.720
 It seems phony to you?

2:39:03.720 --> 2:39:08.360
 It seems phony. Like you should radiate love in whatever way. So even if you're rough with

2:39:08.360 --> 2:39:14.200
 the other person, you should still show like respect and love for that person. And that

2:39:14.200 --> 2:39:17.480
 gets back to the Russian rooms where they're yelling at each other, but they're still loving

2:39:17.480 --> 2:39:24.600
 underneath it. I mean, the question I want to ask for you is, I think you and I have

2:39:24.600 --> 2:39:27.080
 a different view on some things.

2:39:27.080 --> 2:39:27.320
 Okay.

2:39:27.320 --> 2:39:31.560
 We have a different approach to things just on the surface level, but also a different

2:39:31.560 --> 2:39:38.840
 view on some things. I have a lot of hope for institutions. So maybe it's a gut instinct.

2:39:38.840 --> 2:39:45.000
 Like your gut instinct is like centers of power are like, burn them down first and then

2:39:45.000 --> 2:39:46.280
 let's figure it out.

2:39:46.280 --> 2:39:46.680
 Sure.

2:39:46.680 --> 2:39:48.760
 Or maybe that's a funny, rough way of saying it.

2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:50.040
 No, I think that's about right.

2:39:50.040 --> 2:39:55.080
 And then for me, it's like, no, let's understand the institution and slowly,

2:39:55.080 --> 2:40:02.280
 revolutions from within versus revolutions from without. But like we can have those disagreements

2:40:02.280 --> 2:40:06.760
 and there may be times when those disagreements will be, I could see in the future, I could

2:40:06.760 --> 2:40:12.760
 see I'll be attacked by my friend Michael Malice, which I very look forward to it. No,

2:40:12.760 --> 2:40:16.840
 not attacked, but you know what I mean, on the surface level, in the idea space. Anyway,

2:40:16.840 --> 2:40:23.560
 you're shaking your head now, you won't. I guess maybe this also goes to Sam Harrison.

2:40:23.560 --> 2:40:30.200
 Joe Rogan, I would love to be able to disagree, disagree in big ways on important things and

2:40:30.200 --> 2:40:35.320
 still be close friends. And I don't understand why those are, should be contradictions.

2:40:35.320 --> 2:40:35.720
 Yeah.

2:40:35.720 --> 2:40:41.560
 And that's the tension. That's been the most heartbreaking thing to me about Sam and

2:40:41.560 --> 2:40:46.760
 Brett and Joe. In the case of Brett, it's me, I don't know Brett. So I'm just like

2:40:46.760 --> 2:40:51.080
 looking as somebody who just enjoys having these voices out there. And it seems like

2:40:51.080 --> 2:40:57.320
 COVID just brought out the worst in some, many folks. And it just feels like it's so

2:40:57.320 --> 2:41:04.360
 sad to me to see their friendship somewhat deteriorating. Or maybe I'm just being in a...

2:41:04.360 --> 2:41:07.080
 No, it seems clear, it's deteriorated enormously.

2:41:07.080 --> 2:41:09.720
 It's sad that that's the case.

2:41:09.720 --> 2:41:14.280
 Yeah, so my, like I've had people come at me because I'm friends with you. And they

2:41:14.280 --> 2:41:17.400
 were like, Oh, Lex authored some paper about masks. I don't even know what the hell they're

2:41:17.400 --> 2:41:23.880
 referring to. I don't care. I always say and mean, I don't care whether someone agrees

2:41:23.880 --> 2:41:27.800
 with me. I care how they treat me. And it goes the other way. Cause I'll have a lot

2:41:27.800 --> 2:41:30.840
 of people on Twitter who are like, Oh, I'm on your team and blah, blah, blah. I'm like,

2:41:30.840 --> 2:41:34.200
 I don't know you. You're not my team. And just because you happen to agree with me,

2:41:34.200 --> 2:41:39.000
 it's of no value to me. Like I don't know you and I'm interested in knowing you. Many

2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:43.480
 of my friends, I don't know what their politics are. I don't care. Like I care how we hang

2:41:43.480 --> 2:41:47.880
 out. We have a good time. We watch dumb movies, watch YouTube, go to the store, whatever. I

2:41:47.880 --> 2:41:52.600
 don't know what your politics are. I don't care what your politics are. Chris Williamson,

2:41:52.600 --> 2:41:56.360
 who, you know, he's just here. He's going to be moving to Austin. I learned what his

2:41:56.360 --> 2:41:59.960
 politics are in the last, we've been, we chat like almost every day because he took the

2:41:59.960 --> 2:42:03.960
 world's smallest political quiz. And he figured out what his answers were. I had no idea where

2:42:03.960 --> 2:42:11.000
 he's communist. He said, well, obviously. Yeah. Yeah. Marxist. Yeah. Let's be honest.

2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:19.480
 Yeah. So like stuff like that, like it never, and people, I think because politics is often

2:42:19.480 --> 2:42:24.440
 so tribal, especially now, they'll be like, oh, I could never be friends with someone

2:42:24.440 --> 2:42:28.600
 who voted for X. Really? What if they're like grandma worked in that campaign? What if,

2:42:28.600 --> 2:42:33.880
 you know, it's this, you can't think of one steel man argument why this would happen,

2:42:33.880 --> 2:42:39.720
 but if they just want to spite their boss. So I don't like that approach at all. It makes

2:42:39.720 --> 2:42:45.720
 no sense to me. You could still have debates. I mean, like, I would still like to have those

2:42:45.720 --> 2:42:52.520
 conversations and still have disagreements. Like, I disagree with Joe on COVID a lot on

2:42:52.520 --> 2:42:57.400
 a bunch of different things. Very kind of, but it's never like, it's not tense at all.

2:42:58.200 --> 2:43:05.640
 It's just, it's, it doesn't have that arrogance that a lot of COVID conversations seems to have,

2:43:05.640 --> 2:43:12.440
 like talking down to people from both directions. So I would love to have those because I love the

2:43:12.440 --> 2:43:17.720
 debate. I love debates. It takes a lot to get me triggered. And when the Babylon Bee were

2:43:17.720 --> 2:43:22.600
 interviewing Elon and he had this thing, he goes, well, I don't know anyone who wants to,

2:43:22.600 --> 2:43:28.680
 you know, abolish the FDA and the FAA. And I'm standing there and I'm shaking. And the guys look

2:43:28.680 --> 2:43:33.480
 at me and they're like, oh, we actually have an anarchist here. And the example he used was,

2:43:33.480 --> 2:43:37.880
 you know, look, if playing football, you're going to have a referee there and you want the referee,

2:43:37.880 --> 2:43:42.440
 you know, you don't want, but the referee started playing the game is such a good thing. And I'm

2:43:42.440 --> 2:43:47.720
 sitting there, I'm like, the referee doesn't work for the state. The referee is a private individual

2:43:47.720 --> 2:43:54.360
 working for this organization. And there's no reason at all that food quality, which is something

2:43:54.360 --> 2:43:58.520
 crucially important has to be, or can only be delivered through the state and a government

2:43:58.520 --> 2:44:06.040
 monopoly. That's actually really interesting. Just the link on that. Just a little bit with

2:44:06.040 --> 2:44:11.000
 the vaccine and stuff like that, with the antiviral drugs, the FDA. So like, are you

2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:17.320
 comfortable? Like who should be the referee? Right. Do you have an idea? Like what's the best

2:44:17.320 --> 2:44:22.920
 referee for the vaccine? It's just the market. Just let people decide. This is tricky because

2:44:22.920 --> 2:44:29.720
 the thing that I have not been following COVID as closely as Joe and Sam, as Mr. Harris, excuse me,

2:44:29.720 --> 2:44:36.200
 and Mr. Musk. The point is, when anything like this is developing, there's going to be a lot of

2:44:36.200 --> 2:44:41.480
 misinformation out there, even from the scientists, because it's a dynamic process. They don't know

2:44:41.480 --> 2:44:45.000
 what they're dealing with. A lot of it has to be speculative. They don't know long term effects,

2:44:45.000 --> 2:44:52.120
 because it hasn't been around for a long time. So I think it is very dangerous,

2:44:52.120 --> 2:45:00.040
 when Joe was mocked for taking a laundry list of things under his doctor's advice and they kind of

2:45:00.040 --> 2:45:04.200
 latched onto the ivermectin. And then they specifically said it was horse paste, although

2:45:04.200 --> 2:45:09.240
 it's veterinary medicines. Why didn't they say dog paste or cat paste? It's like, well, he's not dead.

2:45:10.200 --> 2:45:16.440
 And he's also taking drugs which are used in other circumstances. The very least, maybe they're

2:45:16.440 --> 2:45:22.280
 pointless, but if the drug is being allowed for pharmaceutical reasons, the odds are quite low

2:45:22.280 --> 2:45:29.640
 that they're going to have deleterious side effects in general. So I think this kind of insistence

2:45:30.200 --> 2:45:38.120
 that there has to be one, a officially approved outcome that we're all doing, that is kind of

2:45:38.120 --> 2:45:43.240
 dangerous thinking in general. By the way, I don't know if you saw, I got a chance to talk to the

2:45:43.240 --> 2:45:50.680
 Pfizer CEO, and I had helped collecting questions. I got a lot of questions and people put at the top

2:45:50.680 --> 2:45:59.880
 a question for Michael Malice. Oh really? No, the ask him what he likes best about me. Oh, what does

2:45:59.880 --> 2:46:03.400
 he like best? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I actually had that on my list of questions I was going to ask him,

2:46:03.400 --> 2:46:09.000
 and my plan was I'll ask him, Michael Malice wants to know what you like best about him,

2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:13.880
 and then my guess was he'd be like, who? And I'd be like, exactly, and then go on to the next.

2:46:14.600 --> 2:46:20.120
 But I thought it was such a tense conversation that I thought there would be no...

2:46:20.120 --> 2:46:25.320
 Of course, room for levity. The question I would ask him is can you acknowledge that there is an

2:46:25.320 --> 2:46:32.760
 enormous incentive for your company to force everyone in America or everyone on earth to be

2:46:32.760 --> 2:46:37.400
 a consumer of your product? Yeah. That's my question. So I danced around that question

2:46:37.400 --> 2:46:44.760
 quite a lot. I phrase it differently, which is a conflict of interest and attention between making

2:46:44.760 --> 2:46:52.120
 a lot of money and actually helping people. I mean, I've asked a lot of really heavy questions

2:46:52.120 --> 2:47:00.280
 in that, and a lot of people wrote to me with support saying that was a really great conversation,

2:47:00.280 --> 2:47:08.600
 and a lot of people wrote saying that, I mean, saying that it was just too soft.

2:47:08.600 --> 2:47:14.840
 And I don't know, I think about that a lot. Like, how do you have that conversation? I don't think

2:47:14.840 --> 2:47:21.400
 it was too soft. And actually, just for the record, I want to say that they didn't see any of the

2:47:21.400 --> 2:47:27.160
 questions I'm asking. They didn't see the final interview. I can ask anything I want.

2:47:27.160 --> 2:47:41.400
 And so any questions that I asked and failed to ask is my own shortcomings. Also, not being a coward,

2:47:41.400 --> 2:47:46.920
 I was afraid of nothing. Like, what do I have to gain or lose exactly? Well, you have something to

2:47:46.920 --> 2:47:53.960
 lose because if you're, I do, I always do softballs. Because if I'm going to make it difficult for

2:47:53.960 --> 2:47:58.600
 someone to come to my show, a lot of people will be disincentivized to do the show. Because like,

2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:02.680
 I don't need this. I see. Oh, yeah, I wasn't thinking like that. But I was, I don't like to,

2:48:02.680 --> 2:48:10.840
 what I think some fraction of folks wanted me to do is to yell at a person, like, criticize them,

2:48:10.840 --> 2:48:16.680
 not even ask questions, essentially. Yeah, yeah, how dare you? Yeah, but to me, my goal,

2:48:16.680 --> 2:48:21.800
 my hope is with these conversations is not just to do how great you are and all that kind of stuff,

2:48:21.800 --> 2:48:28.440
 is to bring out some deeper truth. The beautiful things is when you can together realize some

2:48:28.440 --> 2:48:37.400
 truth, like you mentioned, that the incentive for everyone to take the vaccine is obviously high

2:48:37.400 --> 2:48:45.400
 for the maker of a vaccine. And for them to arrive at that truth together, that is a really difficult

2:48:45.400 --> 2:48:50.920
 truth to operate under. Like, for example, I had a whole exchange with him about,

2:48:52.920 --> 2:48:58.040
 this is Jordan Peterson asked this question, I use that as a kind of springboard, which is the

2:48:59.400 --> 2:49:05.880
 kind of open doors between the FDA, the CDC and Pfizer. Right, like some people work at Pfizer

2:49:05.880 --> 2:49:11.960
 and then go to work at the FDA and then vice versa. And I brought up the idea of, like,

2:49:11.960 --> 2:49:19.800
 this is my safe space, maybe yours too, just going back to the Soviet Union to look at the lessons of

2:49:19.800 --> 2:49:27.800
 human nature and corruption. I said, like, there's two things, this looks bad, and two,

2:49:27.800 --> 2:49:33.080
 this naturally leads to corruption. And I pushed this with several questions, but polite and

2:49:33.080 --> 2:49:39.240
 respectful. And he ultimately said, you know, there's rules. We have to follow the rules.

2:49:39.240 --> 2:49:44.120
 There's very strict rules about this, and we have to follow those rules, otherwise we get

2:49:44.120 --> 2:49:49.640
 punished severely. And so like his responses, like people reacted to them as like, okay,

2:49:49.640 --> 2:49:55.080
 that's the CEO doing the political, but there's also truth to what he's saying. That one of the

2:49:55.080 --> 2:50:01.160
 beautiful things about America is that you can criticize the rule of law currently, but it's still

2:50:01.160 --> 2:50:12.360
 is better than in the Soviet Union where people bribed each other. But still, he made it seem like

2:50:12.360 --> 2:50:19.240
 there's no corruption. People often ask me why I describe myself as an anarchist and not a

2:50:19.240 --> 2:50:23.720
 narcocapitalist, because they think my views are more in line with that school of anarchism.

2:50:24.440 --> 2:50:29.720
 And one of the other reasons you just gave me a good one is that I'm not an anarchist,

2:50:29.720 --> 2:50:35.560
 you just gave me a good one, is that if I am talking to someone who's a major CEO,

2:50:37.400 --> 2:50:43.400
 I have that hardcore left anarchist view that this person is, if not the devil, certainly gonna be

2:50:44.600 --> 2:50:51.320
 sinister, at the very least. And if you can't say, listen, this happens inevitably with elites,

2:50:51.320 --> 2:50:55.640
 it's, you know, it happens in universities, it happens in the food industry, there's only so many

2:50:55.640 --> 2:51:00.200
 people at the top of these things, the field is small, and everyone's gonna know each other,

2:51:00.200 --> 2:51:05.240
 which is kind of, you know, just the dynamics of any market, that would kind of be more reasonable.

2:51:05.240 --> 2:51:09.960
 And just say, it's easy to caricature us because you're not in the boardroom, but we're not,

2:51:09.960 --> 2:51:16.680
 you know, we are trying to produce a product that people want. So unlike the people who criticized

2:51:16.680 --> 2:51:22.520
 me, I was bothered by, I wasn't bothered by most things, but I was bothered by the fact that he

2:51:22.520 --> 2:51:27.720
 didn't show more worry about the corrupting nature of money and power. Like, he should,

2:51:29.160 --> 2:51:35.480
 if you say that there's no corruption, you should show that because we constantly worry about it.

2:51:35.480 --> 2:51:36.280
 Right.

2:51:36.280 --> 2:51:38.920
 Not because like, look, there's rules.

2:51:39.640 --> 2:51:41.320
 Yeah, which are enforced by you.

2:51:41.320 --> 2:51:49.800
 Yeah, exactly. So like, I think the only way to avoid force for time, the corrupting force of

2:51:49.800 --> 2:51:53.640
 power is to freak out about it, nonstop.

2:51:53.640 --> 2:51:57.960
 The impression I always get from people like him, and I haven't seen the interview and I won't be

2:51:57.960 --> 2:52:02.680
 watching it, is they're genuinely convinced that they're good guys.

2:52:03.560 --> 2:52:03.960
 Yeah.

2:52:04.440 --> 2:52:10.920
 And if you're the good guy, sure corruption is a concern theoretically, but I know this guy at the

2:52:10.920 --> 2:52:16.120
 FDA, I know this senator, sure we disagree, sure they do some things I don't like, but in terms of

2:52:16.120 --> 2:52:21.320
 corrupt, they're not getting briefcases full of money, they're not gonna sell a vaccine that,

2:52:21.320 --> 2:52:25.800
 you know, kills people in Georgia. So yeah, it's a concern theoretically, but this is the 21st

2:52:25.800 --> 2:52:28.600
 century. The thought process, I think, writes itself.

2:52:28.600 --> 2:52:34.200
 I think, yeah, having the humility, I do this all the time, maybe to a destructive level,

2:52:34.200 --> 2:52:38.840
 thinking that I might be doing bad for the world, I might be wrong, I might be that kind of thinking

2:52:38.840 --> 2:52:44.120
 is very, you should do at least some of that. Not to a point of being paralyzed, but a little bit.

2:52:44.120 --> 2:52:49.080
 You're actually in the right mindset for me to ask you then for advice.

2:52:49.080 --> 2:52:49.560
 Okay.

2:52:49.560 --> 2:52:53.800
 You're in this compassionate, thoughtful mood, I like it. The compassionate,

2:52:53.800 --> 2:53:02.040
 thoughtful Michael. So for future conversations like that, so the person that offered a conversation

2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:08.520
 that at first I avoided, but I might return to is Anthony Fauci. So there's Anthony Fauci,

2:53:08.520 --> 2:53:14.680
 but then there's also Trump and Biden, people like that. Like if you had them on your show or

2:53:15.640 --> 2:53:19.000
 just giving me advice on how to talk to them, what do you think is the right way

2:53:20.920 --> 2:53:28.120
 to talk to them? And forget about future guests, but like to get at something new, you know,

2:53:28.120 --> 2:53:32.680
 together. Like get at something, not for views or likes or clicks or any of that,

2:53:32.680 --> 2:53:35.560
 but discover something new through the mode of conversation.

2:53:35.560 --> 2:53:40.680
 Well, like let's take those one at a time. So if I was talking to Trump, I told Ruben to ask Trump

2:53:40.680 --> 2:53:45.240
 this and he didn't. What I wanted to know is what's the look on your face when you're sending

2:53:45.240 --> 2:53:49.640
 these tweets, right? Because I imagine him on the toilet with his phone, right? Are you cracking

2:53:49.640 --> 2:53:54.200
 yourself up? Are you just completely stoic? Are you kind of that Trump little smirk he does?

2:53:54.200 --> 2:53:55.000
 Yeah.

2:53:55.000 --> 2:54:00.360
 So when you get someone to open up about their emotion, about some of their passion,

2:54:01.080 --> 2:54:05.000
 I think that breaks down some barriers and creates a bond.

2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:09.800
 Yeah. But Ruben wouldn't be, that's not his style. Like that's a great question for you to ask.

2:54:09.800 --> 2:54:11.560
 Well, I told him to say Michael Malice.

2:54:11.560 --> 2:54:12.200
 Oh, Michael Malice.

2:54:13.400 --> 2:54:19.800
 For Biden, that would be a tough one because Biden gets, doesn't get enough credit for what

2:54:19.800 --> 2:54:25.960
 a good politician he is. There was this moment people can see on YouTube where Biden is addressing

2:54:25.960 --> 2:54:30.600
 a room full of people and he had someone there and he goes, can you, why don't you stand up so

2:54:30.600 --> 2:54:37.640
 everyone can give you a hand? And the guy was in a wheelchair and Biden's like, oh, and like,

2:54:37.640 --> 2:54:41.720
 but instantly he goes, you know what, we're all going to stand up for you. And he made everyone

2:54:41.720 --> 2:54:45.800
 get up and applaud the guy. I'm like, that's quick. Like, yeah, you made a fool of yourself.

2:54:45.800 --> 2:54:50.920
 So he is a glad hander. In many ways, he's more of a schmoozer than Trump was. Like Trump

2:54:50.920 --> 2:54:54.600
 made the point that he knows all the good people, but Biden knows how to shake hands.

2:54:54.600 --> 2:54:58.360
 Well, I think with both, and sorry to interrupt, with both Trump and Biden, like you mentioned

2:54:58.360 --> 2:55:03.880
 earlier, to me, at least their family is fascinating. The dynamic as a family man,

2:55:03.880 --> 2:55:08.840
 as a father, as a... I think that Biden won't acknowledge his illegitimate grandkid is a

2:55:08.840 --> 2:55:13.560
 problem for me. But at the same time, I can see why he thinks it's off limits to ask.

2:55:13.560 --> 2:55:17.080
 So that's the thing when you're dealing with people that powerful, they're not used to having

2:55:17.080 --> 2:55:22.120
 to answer questions, which might be perfectly nice, but would cause them to freak the hell out.

2:55:22.120 --> 2:55:27.240
 That's the tricky thing of talking to people, as you know, like some, some topics are off limit,

2:55:27.240 --> 2:55:34.440
 not in that they draw lines, but they just shut down when you ask them. Trust me, I think I talked

2:55:34.440 --> 2:55:40.520
 to Elon three times now, you better believe I brought up love. And how far do you think that

2:55:40.520 --> 2:55:47.480
 got? And you could just imagine exactly. We did exactly the kind of robot back and forth. And he

2:55:47.480 --> 2:55:52.120
 just like just shut down. So yeah, I worry about that with the person. But that's the thing that

2:55:52.120 --> 2:55:59.560
 makes it fascinating with those two, because he had with Hunter and losing his son, like

2:55:59.560 --> 2:56:08.200
 the dynamic of the complexities of all that, like just having children fuck up in the way children

2:56:08.200 --> 2:56:14.680
 do. And then with Trump, the interesting dynamic with his very different kids and all kind of

2:56:14.680 --> 2:56:19.480
 interesting in different ways and maintaining connection with all of them and also letting

2:56:19.480 --> 2:56:23.560
 them flourish individually is fascinating to me. Well, I also want to ask Trump if he can name all

2:56:23.560 --> 2:56:28.600
 the presidents in order, which there's no, he can, but I'd also want to know all the, do you think

2:56:28.600 --> 2:56:34.040
 he knows who the second president of the United States is? Yes. Okay. John Adams, he knows. I think

2:56:34.040 --> 2:56:39.880
 when it gets between Ulysses S. Grant and McKinley, that's when we all screw up that window. It's

2:56:39.880 --> 2:56:45.160
 tough. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure that's the one window where he, I mean, he's not, he's going to be able

2:56:45.160 --> 2:56:52.280
 to get back to FDR. No question. I have to, my sense was with Donald Trump, and this is not,

2:56:53.000 --> 2:56:57.640
 I would say criticism is he doesn't have a depth of knowledge or more importantly,

2:56:57.640 --> 2:57:01.960
 curiosity about history. Yeah. But if you're old enough, you're going to at least remember

2:57:01.960 --> 2:57:07.640
 the presidents in your lifetime. In your lifetime. Yeah. Sorry. That's what I was saying. He'll get

2:57:07.640 --> 2:57:13.320
 us from president to FDR pretty easily. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Sure. I thought you meant FDR from

2:57:13.320 --> 2:57:18.840
 the other direction. No, no. Yeah. From like current FDR. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, from a

2:57:18.840 --> 2:57:28.120
 political perspective, like having a conversation about politics with those two, there is interesting

2:57:28.120 --> 2:57:33.960
 topics, interaction between Donald Trump and Putin, not the interaction, like not the stupid

2:57:33.960 --> 2:57:41.640
 journalistic stuff, but it's clear to me that he is a student of power. Oh, for sure. And like he

2:57:41.640 --> 2:57:46.920
 enjoys the game of power. Yeah. And so it's interesting because to me, the reason he admires

2:57:46.920 --> 2:57:53.560
 Putin is it's another player in the game of power. And I think why so many people hate him, Trump,

2:57:54.120 --> 2:57:59.560
 is that he demonstrated to a lot of Americans how much of a con job most of politics is and how

2:57:59.560 --> 2:58:03.800
 people just say what they need to do. But behind closed doors, these people are buffoons and he

2:58:03.800 --> 2:58:10.440
 exposed them as that. I'd also, so the Biden, I think Biden would be a tougher interview than

2:58:10.440 --> 2:58:14.120
 Trump because I feel like Biden's more slippery in many ways. He's much more of a consummate

2:58:14.120 --> 2:58:19.240
 politician. He's been in the Senate since the early seventies, since he was like 30 or 35,

2:58:19.240 --> 2:58:26.520
 whatever it was. So, you know, he'd have his little kind of pat answers. There was Larry King,

2:58:26.520 --> 2:58:31.320
 who was certainly a softball interviewer and I don't begrudge him that at all. I remember

2:58:31.320 --> 2:58:36.600
 very vividly and it was like, I think it was the 2008 cycle. He asked Hillary, why do so many

2:58:36.600 --> 2:58:40.440
 people hate you? Why do you think so many people hate you? And she just goes like, oh, well,

2:58:40.440 --> 2:58:44.520
 I take tough stances on the, and he cut her off. He goes, other people have taken those stances.

2:58:44.520 --> 2:58:48.440
 Why do they hate you? And she didn't really, I was really impressed with him that he didn't let her

2:58:48.440 --> 2:58:55.400
 off the hook. That to me is great. But some people will say that's still too softball because you

2:58:55.400 --> 2:59:02.680
 like, they would want him to start listing, I don't know, droning, like all the things that

2:59:02.680 --> 2:59:06.280
 Hillary Clinton is criticized for. Yeah, but then what she, she's done this many times. She's very

2:59:06.280 --> 2:59:09.800
 good at this. She'll be like, look, I've addressed all these in the past. If you want to start

2:59:09.800 --> 2:59:13.560
 rehashing Republican talking points, you can go look up my interviews. Yeah, I think it's

2:59:13.560 --> 2:59:20.760
 counterproductive. Yeah. So what about more prescient for me? I can't believe I'm walking

2:59:20.760 --> 2:59:25.480
 through this fire for no good reason whatsoever, but Anthony Fauci. So let me tell you why I care

2:59:25.480 --> 2:59:31.720
 about Anthony Fauci because I care a lot about science and the way science is viewed in society.

2:59:31.720 --> 2:59:40.680
 And not to put it at the, at the feet of this one person, but I, him and certain members of the

2:59:40.680 --> 2:59:47.320
 scientific community that was responsible for managing the response to COVID, I think are

2:59:47.320 --> 2:59:54.360
 somewhat or entirely responsible for a significant decrease in trust in science. Yes, no question.

2:59:54.360 --> 2:59:57.720
 In the past couple of years. There was a poll that just came out this week that said the number is

2:59:57.720 --> 3:00:05.800
 just collapsed. And if you don't blame him for it, I personally blame him for not

3:00:07.880 --> 3:00:14.840
 improving the problem. And so there's definitely would be a harsh conversation there to be had.

3:00:14.840 --> 3:00:21.560
 And I think I want to have it, but how do you do it? It's tough. Yeah. Because, you know,

3:00:21.560 --> 3:00:26.120
 again, politicians, there's political answers. If they get too frustrated too quickly,

3:00:26.120 --> 3:00:29.560
 they will not explore these difficult things with you. They'll just shut down.

3:00:31.320 --> 3:00:37.160
 But then if you say too many nice things, because I should also say Anthony Fauci is an incredible

3:00:37.160 --> 3:00:43.080
 career. Like there's several hours worth of conversation to be had about how amazing of

3:00:43.080 --> 3:00:46.840
 a person he is. Well, I would also be curious about the AIDS stuff. Yes. Because that's something

3:00:46.840 --> 3:00:50.120
 gets criticized about and I wouldn't come at it aggressively. I would say, let's set the record

3:00:50.120 --> 3:00:54.840
 straight. This is some of the criticism you get, blah, blah, blah. Your role in the AIDS crisis.

3:00:54.840 --> 3:00:59.160
 Let's talk about this. And this is something that is important part of American history. There was

3:00:59.160 --> 3:01:04.120
 a pandemic, but it was localized to certain populations. And that population at the first,

3:01:04.120 --> 3:01:07.960
 at least, was pretty much told goodbye and good luck. You're going to have to deal with this.

3:01:07.960 --> 3:01:11.800
 So how did you deal with that? I mean, were you scared of getting AIDS? You know, so on and so

3:01:11.800 --> 3:01:17.960
 forth. But also there was that comment when, and correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not a Fauci expert,

3:01:17.960 --> 3:01:22.920
 when he basically, they told people not to wear masks or they lied about it to some extent,

3:01:22.920 --> 3:01:25.880
 because they said then people are going to run out of them or something like that. And they

3:01:25.880 --> 3:01:30.440
 admitted they were being inaccurate. I would nail him on that. Like, let's address this.

3:01:30.440 --> 3:01:34.520
 Were you being dishonest? Is there sometimes when it's important to be dishonest in service

3:01:34.520 --> 3:01:40.440
 of whatever? Also, I would ask him how, as someone who's not a politician, whether his level of fame

3:01:40.440 --> 3:01:45.800
 and adulation has gotten to his head. How do you have a perspective when, and how does it feel

3:01:45.800 --> 3:01:50.040
 when a sitting Senator tells you that you should be imprisoned? Do you think Ted Cruz means it,

3:01:50.040 --> 3:01:57.240
 or you think Ted Cruz is just playing to his base? Yeah, I like the fame one. I would love to sneak

3:01:57.240 --> 3:02:02.520
 up. I mean, that question applies to you too. The question applies to me. When you start getting

3:02:02.520 --> 3:02:09.640
 more fame or money or power, are you aware of how that changed you? And like explore that. Like,

3:02:10.680 --> 3:02:16.120
 how has that changed you? Like if you, like in the privacy of your mind, Michael Malice,

3:02:16.120 --> 3:02:22.280
 like how did you change now that you've gotten more attention, let's say, or even the success

3:02:22.280 --> 3:02:29.160
 of the book? Like, is it, like, take yourself back to the, you know, you talk about the early 20s,

3:02:29.160 --> 3:02:33.560
 the mid 20s person. How are you different from that person? Are you the same person or are you

3:02:33.560 --> 3:02:39.880
 totally different? That's an interesting thought. Is Putin the same person in 2020 as he was in 2010

3:02:39.880 --> 3:02:50.040
 and then in 2000? It's a non trivial, almost like. And then the other thing with Fauci is this is

3:02:50.040 --> 3:02:54.440
 the dynamic system. Like on the one hand, he's going to want to say we got it right every time,

3:02:54.920 --> 3:02:59.880
 right? But then how is that even possible when you're dealing with an evolving, unknown, dynamic

3:02:59.880 --> 3:03:04.280
 situation? When did you guys get it wrong? Did that result in lives lost? Do you feel guilty about

3:03:04.280 --> 3:03:10.280
 that? I mean, the big problem with the masks, the changing of mind on the mask is the arrogance in

3:03:10.280 --> 3:03:17.080
 how it was communicated. To me, a lot of this boils down to how things are communicated. It's

3:03:17.080 --> 3:03:20.760
 like, it's obvious that you need to change your mind when you get new information or sometimes,

3:03:20.760 --> 3:03:26.680
 yeah, you take policies that are like, we know the truth, but we're going to lie for a particular

3:03:26.680 --> 3:03:31.720
 reason. Like you have good intentions, but if you're not able to communicate that later,

3:03:31.720 --> 3:03:39.560
 like we made a mistake. Or even ask him, can you understand how a rational person might choose not

3:03:39.560 --> 3:03:47.800
 to get vaccinated? Yes. Yes. Yes. And if he can't steel man that, then that's a situation. That's

3:03:47.800 --> 3:03:52.200
 a good test. And I've tried, and some people succeed and some people fail. The ability to

3:03:52.200 --> 3:03:56.840
 really steel man the other, understand that somebody should, would be hesitant about taking

3:03:56.840 --> 3:04:05.160
 the vaccine. Yeah. It's a giant mess, man. This podcasting is, it's just a fun little conversation,

3:04:05.160 --> 3:04:09.080
 but there also is a responsibility. I don't know. I don't know how Joe does it.

3:04:11.000 --> 3:04:16.040
 I don't think Joe cares as much as you do. It's more fun for him in a sense. And he's less

3:04:16.040 --> 3:04:19.560
 concerned about the, I mean, he's not unconcerned with the cultural impact, but for him, it's just

3:04:19.560 --> 3:04:23.960
 more broing out. Yeah. Like he doesn't do as much prep. He doesn't come in with three pages,

3:04:23.960 --> 3:04:29.800
 single space to, you know, questions. Yeah. And that's why he's talking to Blair White

3:04:29.800 --> 3:04:35.160
 for 10 minutes about whether sharks lay eggs without knowing. You're the one triggered person.

3:04:35.160 --> 3:04:42.040
 He did. Maybe he trolled the troll. Well, it worked. Yeah, he did. The sharks lay eggs.

3:04:43.400 --> 3:04:49.160
 I'd like to get an updated 2021 version of Michael Malice giving advice to young people.

3:04:49.160 --> 3:04:58.040
 Okay. So there's, God forbid, high school students, college students, listening to you

3:04:59.240 --> 3:05:06.280
 and looking to you for advice. What advice would you give them about career and about life? How to

3:05:06.280 --> 3:05:11.320
 live a life they can be proud of. This happens a lot. Cause I have my locals community malice.locals.com

3:05:11.320 --> 3:05:15.720
 and there's a lot of young people on there. So that's a great place. I'll give them a meta piece

3:05:15.720 --> 3:05:21.240
 of advice. Don't ask your friends for advice because you're an idiot at your age and they're

3:05:21.240 --> 3:05:24.600
 all idiots and they don't want to seem like idiots. So they're just going to give you advice. They

3:05:24.600 --> 3:05:27.800
 pulled it from the TV and no one knows that you're talking about and it's just going to be

3:05:27.800 --> 3:05:36.280
 counterintuitive. So seek out advice from people who you seek to emulate and ask them for advice.

3:05:36.280 --> 3:05:40.120
 If you can't get ahold of them, figure out a way to get ahold of them. Incentivize them in some way.

3:05:40.120 --> 3:05:44.760
 You'd be surprised how many people are responsive on Twitter or in social media if you just asked them

3:05:44.760 --> 3:05:49.080
 a basic life question. Cause then they can quote tweet an answer to a whole population. So that

3:05:49.080 --> 3:05:56.440
 would be one mechanism. It's also very hard at that age to realize your parents might not be all

3:05:56.440 --> 3:06:02.520
 that bright and they might not be all that good people. So that's a hard one at that age to kind

3:06:02.520 --> 3:06:06.680
 of wrap your head around. Just cause they love you doesn't mean they understand you. And that's okay.

3:06:06.680 --> 3:06:13.400
 That's, that's okay. We thank everybody. Shit, your Trump's pretty good too. I, I, I'd like your

3:06:13.400 --> 3:06:19.800
 Trump, your Trump to talk to Elon, to have a conversation. Well, Mr. President, you know,

3:06:19.800 --> 3:06:26.600
 look, uh, some things you did like some, not so much, but you know, for the most part, I think

3:06:26.600 --> 3:06:36.840
 they're kind of a good thing. What are you talking about? Um, hey guys, what are you, what are we

3:06:36.840 --> 3:06:41.400
 talking about? No, I fuck, I fucked up the Lex. Anyway, so those would be two pieces. The other

3:06:41.400 --> 3:06:52.040
 piece of advice I would say is join a gym or have some kind of quantifiable daily improvement to keep

3:06:52.040 --> 3:06:58.840
 you sane. So the reason I always say weightlifting and it could be, uh, running, it can be jump rope.

3:06:58.840 --> 3:07:03.480
 I don't care what it is because if you have those numbers moving in the positive direction,

3:07:03.480 --> 3:07:08.120
 psychological, if you're dealing with depression or anxiety, it's concrete proof to shut your brain

3:07:08.120 --> 3:07:14.120
 up because your brain knows how to talk to you. Your brain is often your enemy. And I'll say

3:07:14.120 --> 3:07:19.880
 exactly the right thing to undermine you. So that's an issue. Um, and I think that's a good

3:07:19.880 --> 3:07:26.360
 thing. So that's an issue. Um, be, I just, this works for me. Maybe it worked for most people.

3:07:26.360 --> 3:07:31.560
 I'm very high on the openness metric. Uh, try new experiences, new things, try things you don't like.

3:07:32.760 --> 3:07:36.760
 It's okay to have a bad experience. You've learned something. So go to a restaurant of

3:07:36.760 --> 3:07:41.560
 a cuisine you wouldn't like or hadn't heard of, read a book that's popular, but you have no

3:07:41.560 --> 3:07:47.240
 interest in, um, read a lot. For example, I didn't know anything about the, uh, election. What was

3:07:47.240 --> 3:07:52.040
 it? 1892 when there was like a split between the electors, read a book about it. Oh, I don't know

3:07:52.040 --> 3:07:55.880
 anything. You know, I don't know anything really about Malcolm X. Read a book about him. Uh, you'll

3:07:55.880 --> 3:08:02.280
 be amazed how much more full you become as a person. Do you see value in writing also, like

3:08:02.280 --> 3:08:06.120
 writing down your ideas? No, I think there's very little value in that. I'm not being, I'm not

3:08:06.120 --> 3:08:09.400
 joking. So reading is where the biggest. Yeah. Cause you're probably not going to revisit what

3:08:09.400 --> 3:08:15.160
 you've written down. Um, but the act of writing, you don't, you don't see it solidify somehow

3:08:15.160 --> 3:08:19.320
 thoughts in your mind. Not for me. It doesn't feel like a tweet. Well, cause then it's, then I have

3:08:19.320 --> 3:08:24.680
 to have it narrowed down into like a phrase or the responsibility of there being an audience.

3:08:25.320 --> 3:08:28.920
 No, I just meant in terms of I've got two 80 characters. So instead of having a reandering

3:08:28.920 --> 3:08:33.480
 thought, meandering thought, I have to codify it in something that's catchy and short. That's a

3:08:33.480 --> 3:08:40.200
 good, useful mental exercise. What face do you make when you tweet? I wouldn't know. I don't know.

3:08:40.200 --> 3:08:45.240
 That's a good point. Is it on the toilet? How much, what percentages on the toilet? Very little on

3:08:45.240 --> 3:08:50.520
 the toilets. I usually more reading. Okay. Um, so even though my tweets are all literally shit,

3:08:50.520 --> 3:08:56.200
 uh, there are a few of them are on the toilet. Um, that's some advice. Um,

3:08:58.120 --> 3:09:05.800
 don't compare yourself to other people. That's a really dangerous one. All my friends are married.

3:09:05.800 --> 3:09:10.760
 I should have, I should have a kid by now. Should there's an expression in recovery. Stop shooting

3:09:10.760 --> 3:09:18.840
 yourself. But it's, but it should, should, should. It's stupid. I also, and this could be my hoarder

3:09:18.840 --> 3:09:25.800
 brain. I surround my house with talismans of joy. So if you have an accomplishment, like when I did

3:09:25.800 --> 3:09:31.000
 Rogan once, I bought with the sock store and I bought these orange socks with black cherries on

3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:35.240
 them. And now whenever I wore that socks, those socks, I'm like, Oh, this is cause I was on Rogan.

3:09:35.240 --> 3:09:38.360
 That was kind of a big deal. So if you have these little things throughout your house,

3:09:39.000 --> 3:09:43.720
 it's good mental fuel, even like, like a toy. Remember when I was a kid, Oh, you know what,

3:09:43.720 --> 3:09:50.040
 this little moments that inspire happiness, I think are visually very useful. Um, so that's

3:09:50.040 --> 3:10:00.040
 another one. Um, and I, by the way, have the, that the watch and, um, that cause we're talking

3:10:00.040 --> 3:10:07.160
 about 2021. That was really, um, the guy in the lecture hall giving you a pat in the back,

3:10:08.440 --> 3:10:16.280
 Joe giving me the, the watch was, um, he has life changing from, yeah, yeah, yeah. It doesn't even,

3:10:16.280 --> 3:10:20.200
 I didn't, the fact that it was on a podcast or whatever, it doesn't matter. Learn how to,

3:10:21.400 --> 3:10:25.480
 um, form boundaries. That's probably the biggest, that's going to be number one on my list

3:10:26.120 --> 3:10:29.960
 because you're going to have people around you who feel the need that they're entitled

3:10:29.960 --> 3:10:33.640
 to your time, who feel the need to criticize you and they're not coming from a good place.

3:10:34.440 --> 3:10:37.720
 So it's very good for you to be like, I'm not interested in talking about this anymore right

3:10:37.720 --> 3:10:41.320
 now. Yeah. Even if it's your parents, even if it's your, especially if it's your parents,

3:10:41.320 --> 3:10:45.160
 like I need my space right now, you're entitled to your space. You're entitled to your time.

3:10:45.160 --> 3:10:48.600
 No one knows yours. You don't owe anyone a response. If someone has a question,

3:10:48.600 --> 3:10:51.480
 you don't owe them an answer, especially if they're not coming at you in good faith or

3:10:51.480 --> 3:10:56.600
 they're coming in a hostile way. Um, that's a big one. Uh, it's hard to learn at that age.

3:10:56.600 --> 3:11:08.440
 Um, and, um, and, and be valuable to those who are around you, be someone who people are happy to

3:11:08.440 --> 3:11:15.080
 see. And if things are bad, like you're the one that they can rely on. Like I was just, uh, you

3:11:15.080 --> 3:11:18.760
 know, a little bit under the weather and I thought to myself, you know what, if things got really bad,

3:11:18.760 --> 3:11:23.720
 I'll call Blair and she's, she would take care of me. And that kind of was very reassuring.

3:11:23.720 --> 3:11:31.960
 Yeah. And you can always call me if you have your stuff lifted in, in a, in an urgent matter.

3:11:32.520 --> 3:11:33.880
 Because of the robots?

3:11:33.880 --> 3:11:37.960
 No, just me. It's just kind of like, there's those things I can help with. Or you're actually

3:11:37.960 --> 3:11:42.200
 literally bleeding. I'm not a good caretaker. I can save you though. I can murder. If you need

3:11:42.200 --> 3:11:48.760
 somebody murdered. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, wait, what advice would you have to kids that age?

3:11:48.760 --> 3:11:55.960
 And you're all, you're a lot younger than you think you are. That's the other one. Like,

3:11:55.960 --> 3:11:57.000
 Yeah, there's time.

3:11:57.000 --> 3:12:02.920
 I know. Like it's impossible to understand when you're 26 that your 40s are better than your 30s.

3:12:02.920 --> 3:12:06.440
 Cause it's like, okay, old man, you're, that's all cope. I promise you it is.

3:12:07.880 --> 3:12:11.960
 Yeah. I think, uh, you said so many beautiful things. I would say

3:12:11.960 --> 3:12:19.000
 I would say another version of the openness. I would say take big risks when you're young.

3:12:19.000 --> 3:12:22.840
 Yeah. Cause if you fail, who cares? You're sleeping in a suit. It's not in a futon. Who cares?

3:12:22.840 --> 3:12:24.280
 And take them often.

3:12:24.280 --> 3:12:24.520
 Yeah.

3:12:25.800 --> 3:12:32.920
 I also, this is more a little personal to me. I get pushback on this, but I think

3:12:34.360 --> 3:12:41.400
 take big risks and work really hard. Like at whatever you do. Like, I think you just have to

3:12:41.400 --> 3:12:46.840
 give yourself to a thing. It doesn't have to be in terms of time, but really give everything. So it's

3:12:46.840 --> 3:12:57.720
 not like I'm going to try doing this. I'll try, I'll try, try with all your heart. Like really

3:12:57.720 --> 3:13:03.560
 commit yourself. That doesn't mean necessarily hours. That doesn't mean, but like if you fail

3:13:03.560 --> 3:13:09.880
 at doing a thing that you commit to, it should hurt. So like, uh, when I competed in Jiu Jitsu,

3:13:09.880 --> 3:13:14.600
 or you do like sports and so on, don't just say, I'm going to have fun out there. So on. No,

3:13:14.600 --> 3:13:21.000
 try to win. And because then if you don't, it hurts and you learn from that. Um, and then

3:13:21.000 --> 3:13:27.400
 throughout, I think this, the goodness thing is be kind. It's like, some of it is also a skill,

3:13:27.400 --> 3:13:31.400
 allowing yourself to be kind. I found myself earlier in life. I still do this.

3:13:32.920 --> 3:13:36.680
 I find like when I hang out with people, people are often like cynical and negative.

3:13:37.240 --> 3:13:39.400
 And yeah, I try to avoid those people.

3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:45.560
 No, but like, I think everybody falls into that. And sometimes it's the party norm thing.

3:13:46.280 --> 3:13:51.240
 There's a temptation to me to kind of fit in by being more negative than I'm comfortable being.

3:13:51.800 --> 3:13:58.520
 And so, um, resist the pressure. I think, especially when you're younger, it's not cool

3:13:58.520 --> 3:14:05.480
 to care. The thing that drives, when you're young, if you are a fan of a band, a writer,

3:14:05.480 --> 3:14:11.160
 a podcaster, an actor, and people roll their eyes at you, watch out. Those people are dangerous.

3:14:11.160 --> 3:14:16.760
 You should have it. If you love Avril Lavigne with her terrible music and she makes you,

3:14:16.760 --> 3:14:21.880
 gives you joy and people crap on you, they're wrong and you're right. So hold on to those

3:14:21.880 --> 3:14:26.280
 things that make you happy. And if people want to take that away from you or they,

3:14:26.280 --> 3:14:28.920
 how can you like that? Those people are not your friends.

3:14:28.920 --> 3:14:36.520
 LLOYD Why do you have to go make life so complicated? She's my favorite,

3:14:37.880 --> 3:14:41.800
 favorite musician of all time. Jimi Hendrix II, Avril Lavigne first.

3:14:43.880 --> 3:14:49.560
 Thank you for almost bringing a tear to my eye. You mentioned the shittos in terms of love and

3:14:49.560 --> 3:14:55.800
 you should have kids by now. I apologize if it's a personal one, but I think at least I have this

3:14:55.800 --> 3:14:59.640
 thought and not from society, but for myself. Like I want to get married. I want to have kids.

3:15:01.320 --> 3:15:04.200
 Do you feel the pressure of that? Do you want to have kids?

3:15:04.200 --> 3:15:06.360
 LLOYD I just don't want to have kids.

3:15:06.360 --> 3:15:13.960
 I do want to get married. This was an issue that I had to kind of work out earlier this year

3:15:15.000 --> 3:15:21.480
 in terms of the possibility of having kids. Cause I was in a relationship with someone who would

3:15:21.480 --> 3:15:28.200
 have been in many ways, literally a perfect mom. So I did my due diligence and I actually sat down

3:15:28.920 --> 3:15:32.760
 with friends of mine who had kids and I say, give me the downside.

3:15:32.760 --> 3:15:35.720
 LLOYD You did the pros and the cons.

3:15:35.720 --> 3:15:41.000
 LLOYD The pros I knew. The pros for kids are very, I love kids. I was just with Frank Fleming.

3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:45.400
 He writes for the Babylon Bee and he had his four kids and his youngest son has Down syndrome,

3:15:45.400 --> 3:15:53.480
 which is adorable. Winchester is so cute. And I always get along with kids very well. Like I

3:15:53.480 --> 3:15:59.800
 remember very vividly what it was like to be a kid, especially a precocious kid. And I remember

3:15:59.800 --> 3:16:05.080
 how much it bothered me when my parents friends wouldn't give me attention. So I always make it

3:16:05.080 --> 3:16:10.840
 a point to acknowledge kids, to talk to them and they're very grateful. And it's just really fun.

3:16:11.480 --> 3:16:14.840
 Especially the people who I'm friends with, their kids are probably going to be pretty cool. They're

3:16:14.840 --> 3:16:23.080
 not going to be annoying and kind of ugly and overweight. So I love you got that in there.

3:16:23.080 --> 3:16:30.280
 Okay, good. Sorry, I'll go. But the cons, the negatives, what was the conversation like about

3:16:30.280 --> 3:16:36.040
 that? My sister has two kids, my nephews who I absolutely adore, whatever their names are.

3:16:36.040 --> 3:16:42.840
 And she was saying certain things. It's like, if I had kids, my kids are in my top priority.

3:16:42.840 --> 3:16:49.320
 Yeah. Like it's not even a question. And I feel like the work I'm doing, and this sounds pompous,

3:16:49.320 --> 3:16:56.840
 but it's true, is a valuable and important, but I'm also the only one doing it. So this is a big

3:16:56.840 --> 3:17:05.000
 cost. And so it's like, it would be a major lifestyle readjustment. And I'm at the point

3:17:05.000 --> 3:17:10.440
 where I'm kind of like selfish enough that I wouldn't want to do that. And also would have to

3:17:10.440 --> 3:17:16.360
 be with the right woman. Like you're making a commitment. And since they're all crazy,

3:17:16.360 --> 3:17:20.680
 you have to find one where you can handle the crazy. All women are crazy? Yeah.

3:17:21.400 --> 3:17:26.520
 There are one and a halfs in a binary world. Oh, boy. Yeah. It's not comfortable for me.

3:17:30.360 --> 3:17:33.960
 But do you feel the pressure and thinking of that? How much does that weigh on your heart?

3:17:33.960 --> 3:17:42.360
 Like, so Elon has kids. I feel like I love everything. And I love stuff I do. I love

3:17:42.360 --> 3:17:48.440
 the robot over there. Just working with robots. But I do feel the pressure of like,

3:17:53.880 --> 3:17:58.120
 almost like when there's amazing cuisines you never tried or something like that,

3:17:58.120 --> 3:18:05.000
 like go out there and try it. Like you need to put in the work and I don't know. Like life will run

3:18:05.000 --> 3:18:09.240
 away from you, slip through your fingers before you truly get to experience this other kind of

3:18:09.240 --> 3:18:16.680
 love, which is like long term love for another human being, which is like marriage and then

3:18:17.720 --> 3:18:26.040
 love for kids. Yeah. And it almost makes me sad, like not getting to experience that.

3:18:26.040 --> 3:18:33.800
 You know, because I'm also really scared of, I've seen so many bad stories on the partner side,

3:18:34.360 --> 3:18:39.880
 like being with the wrong person. Right. That to me is, I'm not worried. I have kids all day.

3:18:39.880 --> 3:18:47.400
 In fact, I could probably just have kids without the partner. Kids I think are incredible. But the

3:18:49.160 --> 3:18:54.200
 partner, like a wife, it seems like she could then have the negative consequences for like

3:18:54.200 --> 3:18:59.000
 you as a writer on your productivity and your mental ability to flourish, being a joy to others,

3:18:59.000 --> 3:19:04.200
 to all those kinds of things. You know what? That couldn't happen because every relationship I've

3:19:04.200 --> 3:19:14.440
 had, they've been very beyond supportive. Like they'd rather do the, take an hour and do your

3:19:14.440 --> 3:19:19.160
 work than spend time with me. Like I believe in what you're doing. So I couldn't even casually

3:19:19.160 --> 3:19:23.240
 date someone who didn't believe that. Yeah. So that's energizing. Yes. But over time,

3:19:23.240 --> 3:19:28.120
 you never know like how that evolves and all those kinds of things. And for me, I think we're a

3:19:28.120 --> 3:19:32.280
 little bit different. I mean, that has to do with the engineering thing. I just have to pull insane

3:19:32.280 --> 3:19:38.920
 hours. I work like two hours a day. But that's what like creatives do. Like you can only work

3:19:38.920 --> 3:19:44.360
 a couple hours, honestly, to be productive and the rest of the time not. I have to do a lot of

3:19:44.360 --> 3:19:51.480
 menial labor. And so there, there's legit tension on terms of time and attention, all those kinds

3:19:51.480 --> 3:19:57.800
 of things. I don't know. Do you think about this stuff a lot or do you just love life and do cool

3:19:57.800 --> 3:20:03.960
 stuff and whatever happens, happens? I have been so blessed for so long now that I'm at the point

3:20:03.960 --> 3:20:10.280
 where I don't think about it and I'm like, you know, just like miracles happen every day. So just

3:20:10.840 --> 3:20:19.400
 be open to it. You think about your death, mortality? Yes. Fear? What do you feel about it?

3:20:19.400 --> 3:20:26.440
 I'm just worried. I want to take as many people out with me as possible. So suitcase nuke, suitcase

3:20:26.440 --> 3:20:35.160
 nuke, I'm thinking. Yeah. In New York, that would be kind of like ironic as my other favorite artist.

3:20:35.160 --> 3:20:39.800
 I think about my legacy and that's why my books are so important to me.

3:20:41.400 --> 3:20:46.760
 So do you think of it as a kind of immortality? It is though. Like that's who you are,

3:20:46.760 --> 3:20:52.440
 is those books. Well, it's not who I am, but my legacy certainly is. What do you hope your legacy

3:20:52.440 --> 3:21:02.680
 is? That I encourage people to be hopeful and that I taught them how to be free.

3:21:05.320 --> 3:21:11.320
 And you know, my favorite, I think the best show of all time was Dallas, which often gets,

3:21:11.320 --> 3:21:16.040
 it was like an 80s soap opera and people conflate it with dynasty and they think it's trashy and it

3:21:16.040 --> 3:21:21.320
 was very Shakespearean because all the characters are motivated by different values and the writing

3:21:21.320 --> 3:21:27.880
 is just masterful and the acting is masterful. And I'm not going to spoil anything. One season ended

3:21:28.760 --> 3:21:33.160
 with one of the characters on their deathbed in the hospital and the whole cast is there

3:21:33.160 --> 3:21:41.320
 and the amount of acting talent in that room is just phenomenal. And as the character is dying,

3:21:41.320 --> 3:21:46.760
 they look around and they go, like, please be kind to one another, be a family. And they're

3:21:46.760 --> 3:21:51.080
 yelling at this character, don't you dare die on me, you know? And you could see the actors,

3:21:51.080 --> 3:21:54.440
 you know, cause they're losing their castmate who they've had from the beginning. And it would have

3:21:54.440 --> 3:21:57.560
 been a perfect ending to the show, but obviously it's a cash cow. They got to keep milking it.

3:21:58.120 --> 3:22:02.840
 And I think that like kindness and tenderness, and this is Michael Malice talking,

3:22:02.840 --> 3:22:09.960
 it's, there's a lot of people who want to make it that if you are kind or tender,

3:22:09.960 --> 3:22:14.120
 you're going to have consequences, bad consequences. And I think it's important,

3:22:14.120 --> 3:22:22.360
 for me at least, to create a space in my life that if someone is going to be nice or friendly or kind,

3:22:22.360 --> 3:22:27.960
 that they're not going to have to feel stupid or bad about it. It's, we have such a, it's such a

3:22:27.960 --> 3:22:32.840
 disincentive, the set of structures are different. Like if you want to be cynical and sneering, like

3:22:32.840 --> 3:22:37.720
 round of applause, but if someone says, oh, this is great, like, okay, simp, it's, it's really bad.

3:22:37.720 --> 3:22:45.080
 Well, I think you do just this. You do this today. You do this in our friendship and you

3:22:45.080 --> 3:22:51.640
 do it for a very large number of people is teach them how to be, how to have hope and teach them

3:22:51.640 --> 3:23:03.560
 and teach them how to be free. So, thank you so much for talking to me. Thank you so much for

3:23:03.560 --> 3:23:10.280
 being an inspiration. I love you, brother. I love you. Thanks for listening to this conversation

3:23:10.280 --> 3:23:14.840
 with Michael Malice. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

3:23:14.840 --> 3:23:21.320
 And now let me leave you with some words from Albert Camus. Don't walk in front of me. I may

3:23:21.320 --> 3:23:29.880
 not follow. Don't walk behind me. I may not lead. Walk beside me. Just be my friend. Thank you for

3:23:29.880 --> 3:23:46.840
 thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
