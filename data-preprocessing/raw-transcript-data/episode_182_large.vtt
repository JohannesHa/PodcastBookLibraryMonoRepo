00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
 The following is a conversation with John Donoher,

00:02.800 --> 00:05.980
 widely acknowledged as one of the greatest coaches

00:05.980 --> 00:08.720
 and minds in the martial arts world,

00:08.720 --> 00:11.320
 having coached many champions in jiu jitsu,

00:11.320 --> 00:13.520
 submission grappling, and MMA,

00:13.520 --> 00:18.000
 including Gordon Ryan, Gary Tonin, Nick Rodriguez,

00:18.000 --> 00:21.040
 Craig Jones, Nicky Ryan, Chris Weidman,

00:21.040 --> 00:23.320
 and George St. Pierre.

00:23.320 --> 00:25.120
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:25.120 --> 00:28.960
 Onnit, SimpliSafe, Indeed, and Linode.

00:28.960 --> 00:32.320
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.520
 As a side note, let me say that John

00:34.520 --> 00:36.780
 is a scholar of not just jiu jitsu,

00:36.780 --> 00:40.700
 but judo, wrestling, Muay Thai, boxing, MMA,

00:40.700 --> 00:45.040
 and outside of that, topics of history, psychology,

00:45.040 --> 00:48.240
 philosophy, and even artificial intelligence,

00:48.240 --> 00:50.660
 as you will hear in this conversation.

00:50.660 --> 00:54.560
 After this chat, I started to entertain the possibility

00:54.560 --> 00:57.200
 of returning back to competition as a black belt,

00:57.200 --> 00:59.280
 maybe even training with John and his team

00:59.280 --> 01:02.240
 for a few weeks leading up to the competition.

01:02.240 --> 01:05.880
 For a recreational practitioner such as myself,

01:05.880 --> 01:08.360
 the value of training and competing in jiu jitsu

01:08.360 --> 01:11.620
 is that it is one of the best ways to get humbled.

01:11.620 --> 01:14.640
 To me, keeping the ego in check is essential

01:14.640 --> 01:17.400
 for a productive and happy life.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.040
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast,

01:20.040 --> 01:23.580
 and here is my conversation with John Donoher.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.800
 Are you afraid of death?

01:26.800 --> 01:29.200
 Let's start with an easy question.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.040
 There's no warmup?

01:30.040 --> 01:30.860
 That's it?

01:30.860 --> 01:31.700
 No warmup.

01:31.700 --> 01:32.720
 No jumping jacks?

01:34.060 --> 01:37.140
 Let's break that down into two questions.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.660
 I'm a human being, and like any human being,

01:40.660 --> 01:45.440
 I'm biologically programmed to be terrified of death.

01:45.440 --> 01:49.400
 Every physical element in our bodies

01:49.400 --> 01:52.240
 is designed to keep us away from death.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.880
 I'm no different from anyone else in that regard.

01:54.880 --> 01:58.340
 If you throw me from the top of the Empire State Building,

01:58.340 --> 02:01.220
 I'm gonna scream all the way down to the concrete.

02:01.220 --> 02:03.760
 If you wave a loaded firearm in my face,

02:03.760 --> 02:05.440
 I'm gonna flinch away in horror

02:05.440 --> 02:07.100
 the same way anyone else would.

02:09.080 --> 02:13.360
 So in that first sense of, are you afraid of death?

02:15.320 --> 02:18.760
 My body is terrified of injury leading to death

02:18.760 --> 02:21.720
 the same way any other human being would.

02:21.720 --> 02:24.400
 So when death is imminent, there's a terror that.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.560
 Yeah, I go through the same adrenaline dumps

02:26.560 --> 02:27.920
 that you would go through.

02:28.920 --> 02:29.960
 But on the other hand,

02:29.960 --> 02:31.680
 you're also asking a much deeper question,

02:31.680 --> 02:35.540
 which is presumably, are you afraid of nonexistence?

02:35.540 --> 02:37.520
 What comes after your physical death?

02:37.520 --> 02:39.520
 And that's the more interesting question.

02:40.520 --> 02:45.520
 No, I should start by saying from the start,

02:47.280 --> 02:48.400
 I'm a materialist.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.200
 I don't believe that we have an immortal soul.

02:50.200 --> 02:53.160
 I don't believe there's a life after our physical death.

02:53.160 --> 02:56.240
 In this sense, from someone who starts

02:56.240 --> 02:57.400
 from that point of view,

02:58.400 --> 03:03.400
 you have to understand that everyone has two deaths.

03:04.800 --> 03:08.040
 We always talk about our death as though there was only one,

03:08.040 --> 03:09.780
 but we all have two deaths.

03:09.780 --> 03:12.820
 There was a time before you were born when you were dead.

03:18.360 --> 03:21.660
 You weren't afraid of that period of nonexistence.

03:21.660 --> 03:24.060
 You don't even think about it.

03:24.060 --> 03:27.220
 So why would you be afraid of your second period

03:27.220 --> 03:28.420
 of nonexistence?

03:28.420 --> 03:30.020
 You came from nonexistence.

03:30.020 --> 03:31.540
 You're gonna go back into it.

03:31.540 --> 03:33.320
 You weren't afraid of the first.

03:33.320 --> 03:35.700
 Why are you somehow afraid of the second?

03:35.700 --> 03:37.900
 So it doesn't really make sense to me

03:37.900 --> 03:40.980
 as to why people would be afraid of nonexistence.

03:40.980 --> 03:43.240
 You dealt with it fine the first time.

03:43.240 --> 03:44.700
 Deal with it the second time.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.700
 But your mind didn't exist for the first death.

03:47.700 --> 03:50.380
 And it won't exist after you die either.

03:50.380 --> 03:53.220
 But it does exist now enough to comprehend

03:53.220 --> 03:56.260
 that there's this thing that you know nothing about

03:56.260 --> 03:58.220
 that's coming, which is nonexistence.

03:58.220 --> 03:59.380
 Actually, you do know about it,

03:59.380 --> 04:01.540
 because you know what it was like before you were born.

04:01.540 --> 04:03.140
 It was just nothing.

04:03.140 --> 04:05.260
 Every time you go to sleep at night,

04:05.260 --> 04:06.860
 you get a sneak preview of death.

04:06.860 --> 04:10.860
 It's just this kind of nothing happens.

04:10.860 --> 04:13.260
 You wake up in the morning, you're alive again.

04:13.260 --> 04:15.520
 But it's not about the sleeping.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.640
 It's about the falling asleep.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.540
 And every night when you fall asleep,

04:20.540 --> 04:22.780
 you assume you're going to wake up.

04:22.780 --> 04:25.740
 Here you know you're not waking up.

04:25.740 --> 04:26.580
 And the knowledge of that.

04:26.580 --> 04:28.180
 But there's a whole step from that

04:28.180 --> 04:29.860
 to the idea of fearing it.

04:29.860 --> 04:32.360
 I'm fully aware that there's gonna be a time

04:32.360 --> 04:33.460
 I don't wake up.

04:33.460 --> 04:34.780
 But are you gonna be afraid of it?

04:34.780 --> 04:36.660
 Is there some mortal terror you have of this?

04:36.660 --> 04:38.040
 No, you didn't have it before.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.100
 You don't have it when you sleep.

04:40.100 --> 04:43.060
 Going from the fact that you know you won't wake up

04:43.060 --> 04:45.040
 to terror is two different things.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.460
 That's an extra step.

04:46.460 --> 04:49.900
 And at that point, you're making a choice at that point.

04:50.820 --> 04:54.020
 What about what some people in this context

04:54.020 --> 04:55.800
 we might call like the third death,

04:55.800 --> 05:00.800
 which is when everybody forgets the entirety

05:01.700 --> 05:03.220
 of consciousness in the universe

05:03.220 --> 05:04.700
 forgets that you've ever existed,

05:04.700 --> 05:07.420
 that John Donahue ever existed.

05:07.420 --> 05:08.260
 So.

05:08.260 --> 05:09.900
 It's almost like a cosmic death.

05:09.900 --> 05:12.100
 It's like everything goes, yeah.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.580
 Not just, I would say it's like knowledge.

05:15.580 --> 05:17.820
 The history books forget about who you are

05:17.820 --> 05:19.020
 because the history books.

05:19.020 --> 05:20.300
 This is inevitable, by the way.

05:20.300 --> 05:23.860
 We're all very, very small players in a very big game.

05:23.860 --> 05:27.680
 And inevitably, we're all going to go at some point.

05:28.780 --> 05:31.620
 Yeah, but doesn't, so you're.

05:31.620 --> 05:33.180
 It's disappointing, of course.

05:33.180 --> 05:38.180
 But it's not even, it would be arrogance to say

05:38.340 --> 05:40.580
 I'm disappointed in the idea that I will disappear.

05:40.580 --> 05:43.160
 But there's far greater things than me that will disappear.

05:43.160 --> 05:46.940
 I mean, it's crushing to think

05:46.940 --> 05:48.500
 that there's going to come a time

05:48.500 --> 05:51.900
 where no one will ever hear Beethoven's symphonies again.

05:51.900 --> 05:54.900
 That the mysteries of the pharaohs will be lost

05:54.900 --> 05:57.960
 and no one will even comprehend that they once existed.

05:57.960 --> 06:01.420
 Humanity has come up with so many amazing things

06:01.420 --> 06:02.680
 over its existence.

06:02.680 --> 06:06.580
 And to think that one day this is just all happening

06:06.580 --> 06:11.280
 on a tiny speck in a distant corner of a very small galaxy

06:11.280 --> 06:13.220
 and among millions of galaxies,

06:13.220 --> 06:15.020
 that this is all for nothing.

06:15.020 --> 06:16.100
 Okay, I can understand.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.300
 There's a kind of dread that comes with this.

06:20.060 --> 06:22.780
 But there's also a sense in which the moment you're born

06:22.780 --> 06:24.500
 and the moment you can think about these things,

06:24.500 --> 06:26.820
 you know this is your inevitable fate.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.020
 Is it so inevitable?

06:28.020 --> 06:30.260
 So if we look at, we're in Austin

06:30.260 --> 06:32.460
 and there's a guy named Elon Musk.

06:32.460 --> 06:35.160
 And he's hoping, in fact, that is the drive

06:35.160 --> 06:36.820
 behind many of his passions,

06:36.820 --> 06:40.740
 is the human beings becoming a multi planetary species

06:40.740 --> 06:44.180
 and expanding out, exploring and colonizing

06:44.180 --> 06:46.660
 the solar system, the galaxy,

06:46.660 --> 06:48.880
 and maybe the rest of the universe.

06:48.880 --> 06:52.180
 Is that something that fills you with excitement?

06:52.180 --> 06:54.200
 As a project, it's very exciting.

06:56.060 --> 06:59.780
 The whole, I mean, we all grew up with science fiction,

06:59.780 --> 07:02.640
 the idea of exploration.

07:02.640 --> 07:06.500
 The same way human beings in earlier centuries

07:06.500 --> 07:08.740
 were thrilled at the idea of discovering a new world,

07:08.740 --> 07:10.900
 you know, America or some other part of the world

07:10.900 --> 07:13.580
 that they sail to and come back.

07:13.580 --> 07:15.260
 But now instead of sailing oceans,

07:15.260 --> 07:20.260
 you're sailing solar systems and ultimately even further.

07:20.460 --> 07:21.900
 So of course that's exciting.

07:21.900 --> 07:25.060
 But as far as relieving us from non existence,

07:25.060 --> 07:26.940
 it's just playing a delaying game

07:26.940 --> 07:30.060
 because ultimately, even the universe itself,

07:30.060 --> 07:31.940
 if the laws of thermodynamics are correct,

07:31.940 --> 07:33.320
 will ultimately die.

07:33.320 --> 07:38.320
 Of course, we might not understand most of the physics

07:40.400 --> 07:42.600
 and how the universe functions.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.120
 You said laws of thermodynamics,

07:44.120 --> 07:47.000
 but maybe that's just a tiny little fraction

07:47.000 --> 07:49.080
 of what the universe actually is.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.360
 Maybe there's multiple dimensions,

07:50.360 --> 07:52.940
 maybe there's multiple universes,

07:52.940 --> 07:55.520
 maybe the entirety of this experience.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.400
 You know, there's guys like Donald Hoffman

07:57.400 --> 07:59.400
 that think that all of this is just an illusion

07:59.400 --> 08:03.720
 that we don't, like human cognition and perception

08:03.720 --> 08:05.600
 constructs a whole, it's like a video game

08:05.600 --> 08:07.080
 that we construct that's very distant

08:07.080 --> 08:08.600
 from the actual reality.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.680
 And maybe one day we'll understand that reality,

08:10.680 --> 08:12.760
 maybe it'll be like the matrix kind of thing.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.120
 So there's a lot of different possibilities here.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.880
 And there's also a philosopher named Ernest Becker.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.240
 I don't know if you know who that is.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.560
 He wrote Denial of Death.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.980
 And his idea, he disagrees with you, but he's dead now,

08:25.980 --> 08:30.980
 is that he thinks that the terror of death,

08:31.900 --> 08:35.380
 the terror of the knowledge that we're going to die

08:35.380 --> 08:38.020
 is within all of us and is in fact the driver

08:38.020 --> 08:41.460
 behind most of the creativity that we do.

08:41.460 --> 08:43.580
 Exploring out into the universe,

08:43.580 --> 08:47.820
 but also you becoming one of the great scholars

08:47.820 --> 08:52.540
 of the martial arts, the philosophers of fighting

08:52.540 --> 08:55.460
 is because you're actually terrified of death

08:55.460 --> 09:00.460
 and you want to somehow permeate your knowledge,

09:00.940 --> 09:05.500
 your ideas, your essence to permeate human civilization

09:05.500 --> 09:09.600
 so that even when your body dies, you live on.

09:10.780 --> 09:14.140
 I would agree with him insofar as death

09:14.140 --> 09:18.060
 is the single greatest motivator for action.

09:18.060 --> 09:22.100
 But going beyond that and saying it's somehow terrifying,

09:22.100 --> 09:24.180
 that's an extra step on his part.

09:24.180 --> 09:27.540
 And not everyone's going to follow him on that step.

09:27.540 --> 09:32.540
 I do believe that death is the single most important element

09:34.060 --> 09:37.280
 in life that gives value to our days.

09:37.280 --> 09:40.900
 If you think, for example, of a situation

09:40.900 --> 09:44.340
 where a God came to you and gave you immortality,

09:46.380 --> 09:49.360
 life would be very, very different for you.

09:49.360 --> 09:54.360
 You're a talented research scientist, you work to a schedule.

09:55.900 --> 09:56.740
 Why?

09:56.740 --> 09:59.260
 Because ultimately you know your life is finite

09:59.260 --> 10:01.140
 and actually very finite.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.800
 And could be even more so if fate plays its hand

10:05.800 --> 10:08.960
 and you die an early death or what have you.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.100
 We never know what's going to happen tomorrow.

10:13.160 --> 10:18.160
 As such, we get work done as soon as we can.

10:18.160 --> 10:21.320
 The moment you gain immortality,

10:21.320 --> 10:23.920
 you can always put every project off.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.920
 You can always say, I don't need to do this today

10:25.920 --> 10:30.080
 because I can do it four centuries from now.

10:30.080 --> 10:33.320
 And as you extend artificially a human life,

10:33.320 --> 10:36.080
 the motivation to get things done here and now

10:36.080 --> 10:40.300
 and work industriously and excel fades away

10:40.300 --> 10:42.700
 because you can always come back to the idea

10:42.700 --> 10:45.080
 that you can do this in the future.

10:45.080 --> 10:49.920
 And so what gives value to our days is ultimately death.

10:49.920 --> 10:54.920
 And value, it's not the only reason behind value,

10:55.440 --> 10:59.480
 but a huge part of what we consider value is scarcity.

10:59.480 --> 11:02.080
 And death gives us scarcity of days

11:02.080 --> 11:04.620
 and is probably the single greatest motivator

11:04.620 --> 11:08.200
 for almost every action we partake in.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.240
 It's kind of tragic and beautiful

11:10.240 --> 11:15.240
 that what makes things amazing is that they end.

11:19.060 --> 11:22.480
 Yeah, I think it would actually be a terrible burden

11:22.480 --> 11:23.640
 to be immortal.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.820
 Life would be in many ways very hollow and meaningless,

11:29.820 --> 11:30.860
 I think.

11:30.860 --> 11:34.140
 People talk about death taking away the meaning of life,

11:34.140 --> 11:37.440
 but I think immortality would have a very similar effect

11:37.440 --> 11:42.160
 in a different direction.

11:42.160 --> 11:47.160
 So given this short life, we can think about jujitsu,

11:48.400 --> 11:51.360
 we can think about any kind of pursuit.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.320
 What do you think makes a great life?

11:54.400 --> 11:59.180
 Is it the highest peak of achievement?

12:00.240 --> 12:03.160
 You know, you think about like an Olympic gold medal,

12:03.160 --> 12:05.200
 the highest level of performance,

12:05.200 --> 12:08.560
 or is it the longevity of performance,

12:08.560 --> 12:12.220
 of doing many amazing things and doing it for a long time?

12:12.220 --> 12:15.380
 I think the latter is kind of what we talk about

12:15.380 --> 12:18.200
 in at least American society.

12:18.200 --> 12:22.620
 You know, we want people to be healthy, balanced,

12:22.620 --> 12:25.360
 perform well for a long time.

12:25.360 --> 12:30.360
 And then there's maybe like the gladiator ethic,

12:30.440 --> 12:33.800
 which is the highest peak is what defines.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.440
 You asked an initial question,

12:35.440 --> 12:37.600
 which what makes a great life,

12:37.600 --> 12:40.600
 but then pointed towards two options,

12:40.600 --> 12:43.680
 one of longevity versus degree of difficulty.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.840
 There's gotta be a lot more than that, surely.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.960
 I mean, think about, first of all,

12:50.960 --> 12:52.360
 we have to understand from the start

12:52.360 --> 12:55.080
 that there's never gonna be an agreed upon set of criteria

12:55.080 --> 12:58.680
 for this is a great life from all perspective.

12:58.680 --> 13:01.720
 If you look from the perspective of, say, Machiavelli,

13:01.720 --> 13:03.900
 then Stalin lived a great life.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.000
 He was highly successful at what he did.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.400
 He started from nothing.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.480
 So the degree of difficulty in what he did

13:10.480 --> 13:12.400
 was extraordinarily high.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.800
 He had massive impact upon world history.

13:15.800 --> 13:20.240
 He oversaw the defeat of almost all of his major enemies.

13:20.240 --> 13:23.640
 He lived to old age and died of natural causes.

13:23.640 --> 13:26.920
 So from Machiavelli's point of view, he had a great life.

13:26.920 --> 13:30.000
 If you ask the Ukrainian farmer in the 1930s

13:30.000 --> 13:31.080
 whether he lived a great life,

13:31.080 --> 13:32.680
 you get a very different answer.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.600
 So everything's gonna come

13:34.600 --> 13:37.760
 from what perspective you begin with this.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.080
 You're going to look out at the world

13:39.080 --> 13:40.080
 with a given point of view,

13:40.080 --> 13:41.240
 and you're gonna make your judgments.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.940
 Was this a great life or was this a terrible life?

13:45.960 --> 13:48.460
 Going back to your point, you were actually,

13:48.460 --> 13:51.880
 I think, focusing the question on more

13:51.880 --> 13:55.640
 in terms of great single performances

13:55.640 --> 13:57.400
 versus longevity of performances.

13:58.520 --> 14:00.420
 Presumably, this isn't really a question

14:00.420 --> 14:03.400
 about what makes a great life, then,

14:03.400 --> 14:06.920
 because there's so much more than that to a great life.

14:06.920 --> 14:07.760
 I don't know.

14:07.760 --> 14:08.840
 I'm gonna push back on that.

14:08.840 --> 14:11.440
 So I think the parallels are very much closer

14:11.440 --> 14:13.080
 than you're making them seem.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.920
 I think, let's compare Stalin.

14:14.920 --> 14:18.420
 Stalin is an example of somebody who held power,

14:18.420 --> 14:22.080
 considered by many to be one of the most powerful men ever.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.120
 He held power for 30 years.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.080
 So that's what I'm referring to, longevity.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.880
 And then there's a few people,

14:27.880 --> 14:31.120
 I wish my knowledge of history was better,

14:31.120 --> 14:34.860
 but people who fought a few great battles,

14:34.860 --> 14:37.840
 and they did not maintain power, but they were.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.680
 Let's contrast, say, for example, Alexander the Great,

14:40.680 --> 14:45.640
 who died at 33 from probably unnatural causes,

14:48.440 --> 14:53.440
 had around four to five truly defining battles in his life,

14:53.440 --> 14:58.440
 which responsible for the lion's share of his achievements,

15:00.400 --> 15:04.520
 and burned very bright, but didn't burn long.

15:04.520 --> 15:07.360
 Stalin, on the other hand, started from nothing,

15:07.360 --> 15:09.560
 and quietly, methodically worked his way

15:09.560 --> 15:10.940
 through the revolutionary phase,

15:10.940 --> 15:14.400
 and gained increasing amounts of power,

15:14.400 --> 15:19.400
 and as he said, went all the way to the end of his career.

15:21.340 --> 15:23.120
 Yeah, there's definitely something to be said

15:23.120 --> 15:28.120
 for longevity, but as to which one is greater than the other,

15:29.880 --> 15:34.880
 you can't give a definition, or a set of criteria,

15:36.520 --> 15:39.560
 which will definitively say this is better than that.

15:39.560 --> 15:40.400
 But when you look...

15:40.400 --> 15:42.000
 Ultimately, we look at Alexander as great,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.320
 but in a different way, and we look at Stalin.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.200
 I didn't think many people would say

15:45.200 --> 15:46.220
 Stalin was a great person,

15:46.220 --> 15:49.040
 but from the Machiavellian point of view,

15:49.040 --> 15:53.360
 you would say he was great also.

15:53.360 --> 15:56.360
 But when you think about beautiful creations

15:56.360 --> 15:59.880
 done by human beings in the space of, say,

15:59.880 --> 16:02.120
 martial arts, in the space of sport,

16:03.220 --> 16:06.900
 what inspires you, the peak of performance?

16:06.900 --> 16:08.480
 I see where you're coming from.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.160
 It's a great question.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.960
 For me, it always comes down to degree of difficulty,

16:13.960 --> 16:17.320
 but things are difficult in different ways, okay?

16:17.320 --> 16:22.320
 A single, flawless performance in youth

16:22.700 --> 16:25.280
 is still that wins a gold medal.

16:25.280 --> 16:28.320
 Let's say, for example, Nadia Comaneci

16:28.320 --> 16:31.240
 won the Olympic gold medal in gymnastics,

16:31.240 --> 16:34.160
 the first person ever to get a perfect score.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.440
 If she had disappeared after that,

16:36.440 --> 16:39.120
 we would still remember that as an incredible moment.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.320
 And the degree of difficulty to get a perfect score

16:42.320 --> 16:46.000
 in Olympic gymnastics is just off the charts.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.240
 And contrast that with someone who went to four Olympics

16:50.240 --> 16:52.040
 and got four silver medals.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.920
 I mean, they're both incredible achievements.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.040
 They're just different.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.380
 The attributes that lead to longevity

16:59.380 --> 17:01.780
 typically tend to conflict with the attributes

17:01.780 --> 17:05.240
 that bring a powerful, single performance.

17:05.240 --> 17:08.560
 One is all about focus on a particular event.

17:08.560 --> 17:13.560
 The other is on spreading your resources over time.

17:13.560 --> 17:16.100
 Both present tremendous difficulties.

17:17.140 --> 17:19.460
 There's no need to say one is better than the other.

17:19.460 --> 17:21.700
 There's also just, for me personally,

17:21.700 --> 17:26.700
 the stories of somebody who truly struggled

17:26.700 --> 17:29.100
 are the most powerful.

17:29.100 --> 17:31.420
 I know a bunch of people don't necessarily agree,

17:31.420 --> 17:33.620
 because you said perfection.

17:33.620 --> 17:37.140
 Perfection is kind of the antithesis of struggle.

17:37.140 --> 17:39.500
 But I look at somebody, okay, my own life,

17:39.500 --> 17:41.700
 somebody I'm a fan, oh, I'm a fan of everybody.

17:41.700 --> 17:42.840
 I'm a huge fan of yours.

17:42.840 --> 17:44.020
 I'm trying not to be nervous here.

17:44.020 --> 17:47.100
 But somebody I'm a fan of in the judo world

17:47.100 --> 17:49.060
 is Travis Stevens.

17:49.060 --> 17:50.980
 He's a remarkable fellow, by the way.

17:50.980 --> 17:52.500
 A remarkable human being.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.860
 Insane in the best kinds of ways.

17:54.860 --> 17:59.000
 I think I started judo, I really started martial arts.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.940
 I wrestled, if you consider those martial arts.

18:00.940 --> 18:03.500
 That's been in my blood.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.780
 I'm Russian, so.

18:04.780 --> 18:08.800
 But beyond that, the whole pajama thing we wear, the gi,

18:08.800 --> 18:12.700
 I started by watching Travis in 2008 Olympics.

18:12.700 --> 18:15.300
 Was that accidental, or did you know Travis

18:15.300 --> 18:16.140
 prior to watching him?

18:16.140 --> 18:17.700
 No, no, no, I just tuned in.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.380
 Now, that's an unusual choice.

18:19.380 --> 18:20.900
 It was just random, you just tuned in

18:20.900 --> 18:22.300
 and you saw Travis Stevens.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.820
 I tuned in to the Olympics,

18:23.820 --> 18:26.160
 and I was wondering what judo is.

18:26.160 --> 18:29.060
 And then I started watching.

18:30.100 --> 18:32.740
 We're all proud of our countries and so on,

18:32.740 --> 18:33.740
 so I started watching.

18:33.740 --> 18:36.740
 He was, I think, the only American

18:36.740 --> 18:39.920
 in the Olympics for judo.

18:39.920 --> 18:44.020
 Maybe the, so this Kayla Harrison was 2012.

18:44.020 --> 18:47.340
 Rhonda was there too, so I watched Rhonda and Travis.

18:47.340 --> 18:51.500
 But obviously, sort of, I was focused on somebody

18:51.500 --> 18:53.060
 who also weighed the same as I did,

18:53.060 --> 18:57.540
 so there was a kinda, I think, 81 kilograms.

18:57.540 --> 19:00.300
 So there's a connection, but also there's an intensity

19:00.300 --> 19:05.300
 to him, like, he would get angry at his own failures

19:06.100 --> 19:07.820
 and he would just refuse to quit.

19:07.820 --> 19:10.580
 It's that kinda Dan Gable mentality.

19:10.580 --> 19:14.100
 I just, that was inspiring to me, that he's the underdog.

19:14.100 --> 19:17.620
 And the way people talk about him, the commentators,

19:17.620 --> 19:21.380
 that it was an unlikely person to do well, right?

19:21.380 --> 19:25.380
 And I, the FU attitude behind that,

19:25.380 --> 19:27.260
 saying, no, I'm gonna still win gold.

19:27.260 --> 19:29.260
 Obviously, he didn't do well in 2008,

19:29.260 --> 19:33.380
 but that was somehow inspiring.

19:33.380 --> 19:36.460
 And I just remember he pulled me in,

19:36.460 --> 19:39.500
 but then I started to see this sport,

19:39.500 --> 19:40.820
 I guess you can call it,

19:42.100 --> 19:47.100
 of effortlessly dominating your opponent in throwing.

19:48.580 --> 19:52.220
 Because to me, wrestling was like a grind.

19:52.220 --> 19:56.900
 You kind of control, you slowly just break your opponent.

19:56.900 --> 20:01.380
 The idea that you could, with like a foot sweep,

20:01.380 --> 20:06.100
 was fascinating to me, that just because of timing,

20:06.100 --> 20:10.500
 you can take these like monsters, giant people,

20:10.500 --> 20:14.660
 like incredible athletes, and just smash them.

20:14.660 --> 20:18.180
 With, it just doesn't, there was no struggle to it.

20:18.180 --> 20:19.980
 It was always like a look of surprise.

20:19.980 --> 20:23.580
 Judo, dominance in Judo has a look,

20:23.580 --> 20:27.060
 like the other person is like, what just happened?

20:27.060 --> 20:28.580
 This is very different from wrestling.

20:28.580 --> 20:30.700
 It's built into the rule structure too,

20:30.700 --> 20:32.060
 the whole idea of an epon,

20:32.060 --> 20:34.300
 of a match being over in an instant.

20:34.300 --> 20:39.020
 And that creates a thrilling spectator sport,

20:39.020 --> 20:42.020
 because you can, as you say, with Ashiwaza,

20:42.020 --> 20:45.980
 the foot sweeps, you can take someone out

20:45.980 --> 20:49.780
 who's heavily favored, and if you're not,

20:49.780 --> 20:53.460
 Judo is the most unforgiving of all the grappling sports.

20:53.460 --> 20:56.380
 If you have a lapse of concentration for half a second,

20:56.380 --> 20:59.220
 it's done, it's over.

20:59.220 --> 21:01.180
 If those guys get a grip on each other,

21:01.180 --> 21:05.340
 any one of them can throw the other.

21:05.340 --> 21:10.340
 The idea, when you see someone like Nomura,

21:11.060 --> 21:14.220
 who won three Olympic gold medals,

21:14.220 --> 21:17.500
 to win across three Olympics,

21:17.500 --> 21:19.460
 and that's an incredible achievement,

21:19.460 --> 21:21.500
 given how many ways there are to lose

21:21.500 --> 21:22.900
 in the standing position in Judo,

21:22.900 --> 21:25.660
 and how unforgiving it is as a sport,

21:25.660 --> 21:28.660
 it shows an incredible level of dominance.

21:28.660 --> 21:32.700
 And I think when I was also introduced at that time

21:33.900 --> 21:36.380
 to the idea, just like in Judo,

21:36.380 --> 21:38.140
 I think in Jiu Jitsu is the same,

21:38.980 --> 21:40.620
 a lot of sports is probably the same,

21:40.620 --> 21:44.100
 is there's ways to win that include kind of,

21:45.140 --> 21:48.100
 if I were to use a bad term, stalling,

21:48.100 --> 21:51.260
 which is like use strategy to slow down,

21:51.260 --> 21:53.580
 to destroy all the weapons your opponent has,

21:53.580 --> 21:55.220
 and just to wait it out,

21:55.220 --> 21:58.380
 to sort of break your opponent by,

21:58.380 --> 22:00.140
 yeah, shutting down all their weapons,

22:00.140 --> 22:02.380
 but not using any of your own.

22:02.380 --> 22:06.460
 And now, Travis was always going for,

22:06.460 --> 22:08.940
 he's of course really good at gripping

22:08.940 --> 22:10.260
 and couldn't do that whole game,

22:10.260 --> 22:12.860
 but he was going for the big throws.

22:12.860 --> 22:15.500
 And he was almost getting frustrated

22:15.500 --> 22:17.660
 by a lot of the opponents.

22:17.660 --> 22:21.660
 I remember Ola Bischoff, I think.

22:21.660 --> 22:23.580
 Yes, from Germany.

22:23.580 --> 22:24.420
 From Germany.

22:24.420 --> 22:25.300
 Very talented.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.300
 Very incredible.

22:26.300 --> 22:28.580
 I know he's very good at doing big throws

22:28.580 --> 22:29.820
 and he's an incredible judoka,

22:29.820 --> 22:31.980
 but he was also incredible

22:31.980 --> 22:33.740
 at just frustrating his opponents

22:33.740 --> 22:36.100
 with gripping and strategy and so on.

22:36.100 --> 22:39.660
 And I just remember feeling the pain of this person,

22:39.660 --> 22:42.460
 like Travis, who went through just,

22:42.460 --> 22:44.420
 he broke like every part of his body.

22:44.420 --> 22:46.500
 He went through so many injuries.

22:46.500 --> 22:50.060
 Just this person who dedicated his entire life

22:50.060 --> 22:55.060
 to this moment in 2008 and then 2012 and 2016,

22:55.060 --> 22:57.020
 just gave everything.

22:57.020 --> 22:58.420
 You could see it on his face

22:59.620 --> 23:04.380
 that his weapons are being shut down

23:04.380 --> 23:05.940
 and he's still pushing forward.

23:05.940 --> 23:09.420
 He's still with that, both the frustration and the power.

23:09.420 --> 23:14.140
 I mean, the kind of throw he does is his main one,

23:14.140 --> 23:16.740
 I think, is the standing, it was called Seoi Nage.

23:16.740 --> 23:17.580
 Ippon Seoi Nage.

23:17.580 --> 23:18.420
 Ippon Seoi Nage.

23:18.420 --> 23:21.220
 But that was the other thing is like,

23:21.220 --> 23:25.220
 the techniques he used was these big throws

23:25.220 --> 23:27.860
 that there's something to me about the Seoi Nage.

23:27.860 --> 23:29.980
 I fell in love with that throw.

23:29.980 --> 23:34.300
 That's my main throw, standing Seoi Nage.

23:34.300 --> 23:35.260
 That is like...

23:35.260 --> 23:37.100
 Why do you favor the standing variation?

23:37.100 --> 23:38.300
 Because of the amplitude?

23:39.540 --> 23:41.780
 You get a more powerful wind up.

23:41.780 --> 23:43.220
 Yeah, power.

23:43.220 --> 23:44.060
 It's like...

23:44.060 --> 23:45.220
 Are you a fan of Koga?

23:45.220 --> 23:46.060
 Yes.

23:46.060 --> 23:48.500
 That's when I, Travis,

23:48.500 --> 23:51.340
 so Koga and Travis opened up my...

23:52.740 --> 23:54.460
 Travis uses the same gripping patterns

23:54.460 --> 23:55.700
 for Seoi Nage as Koga.

23:55.700 --> 23:59.460
 All the same, and the way he uses his hips and turns.

23:59.460 --> 24:01.780
 And I remember going to my judo club

24:01.780 --> 24:05.020
 and other judo clubs and they were all saying,

24:05.020 --> 24:07.020
 this is the wrong way to do it.

24:07.020 --> 24:08.780
 The way Travis does it is the wrong way to do it.

24:08.780 --> 24:09.620
 And I remember...

24:09.620 --> 24:11.060
 I've always been amazed by this, by the way.

24:11.060 --> 24:12.340
 I don't mean to cut you off,

24:12.340 --> 24:17.340
 but I could literally fill 20 hours

24:17.340 --> 24:22.340
 of reproductions of people who will tell me

24:22.820 --> 24:26.860
 that either my students or other great world champions

24:28.220 --> 24:29.780
 are doing things wrong.

24:30.700 --> 24:35.140
 And I'm looking at them and I'm like,

24:35.140 --> 24:38.260
 who would I rather trust here in their judgment?

24:39.380 --> 24:44.300
 Koga, who was one of the greatest throwers of all time,

24:44.300 --> 24:49.300
 or you, a recreational guy who couldn't throw my grandmother.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.740
 I'm supposed to take your word over his.

24:56.740 --> 25:00.620
 Well, say, don't listen to what people say.

25:00.620 --> 25:02.500
 I'm gonna give you a piece of advice here.

25:02.500 --> 25:06.020
 Watch what the best people do, okay?

25:06.020 --> 25:09.220
 That's how you get superior athletic performance.

25:09.220 --> 25:11.180
 I'm gonna say that again.

25:11.180 --> 25:13.060
 Don't listen to what people say.

25:13.060 --> 25:14.860
 Watch what they do,

25:14.860 --> 25:17.420
 particularly under the stress of high level competition,

25:17.420 --> 25:19.580
 because that's when you see their real game,

25:19.580 --> 25:22.540
 what they really do under pressure, okay?

25:22.540 --> 25:24.220
 And if you can emulate that,

25:24.220 --> 25:26.020
 you're gonna be very successful.

25:26.020 --> 25:29.740
 I guess what I was frustrated with, to your point,

25:29.740 --> 25:32.740
 is that the argument against Koga

25:32.740 --> 25:37.020
 is he has a very specific body type

25:37.020 --> 25:39.540
 and he figured out something that worked for him.

25:39.540 --> 25:44.540
 The statement is that might not be applicable to you

25:46.340 --> 25:49.460
 or to the general public of judo players

25:49.460 --> 25:51.220
 that wanna succeed.

25:51.220 --> 25:56.220
 That, by the way, at the shallow level, might be true.

25:57.260 --> 26:00.260
 The point is there might be a body of knowledge

26:00.260 --> 26:05.260
 that's yet to be discovered and explored that Koga opened up

26:05.260 --> 26:09.980
 that I wanted to understand why his technique worked.

26:09.980 --> 26:12.420
 It made no sense to me that with a single foot,

26:12.420 --> 26:14.180
 like the way you turn the hip,

26:14.180 --> 26:17.500
 the single foot that steps in, why does that work?

26:17.500 --> 26:20.500
 Because it was actually very difficult to make work

26:20.500 --> 26:23.180
 for me as a white belt in the very beginning.

26:23.180 --> 26:24.500
 It doesn't make sense.

26:24.500 --> 26:28.060
 Like people just, they don't get loaded up onto your hip.

26:28.060 --> 26:30.740
 Anyway, for people who don't watch Koga highlights,

26:30.740 --> 26:32.660
 watch Travis Stevens highlights,

26:32.660 --> 26:36.740
 but the details of the technique don't make sense,

26:36.740 --> 26:40.180
 but when mastered, it feels like

26:40.180 --> 26:42.220
 there's something fundamental there

26:42.220 --> 26:43.940
 that hasn't been explored yet.

26:43.940 --> 26:48.340
 It's like Koga and Travis made me think

26:48.340 --> 26:53.340
 that we don't know most of the body mechanics involved

26:53.940 --> 26:55.660
 in dominance in judo.

26:55.660 --> 26:57.900
 Like we just kind of found a few pockets

26:57.900 --> 26:58.860
 that work really well.

26:58.860 --> 27:02.820
 There's Yamada, there's these different throws, Osorogari.

27:02.820 --> 27:05.180
 I wonder if there's like totally cool new things

27:05.180 --> 27:06.180
 that we haven't discovered.

27:06.180 --> 27:07.980
 And that Seinagi gave a little peak

27:07.980 --> 27:10.980
 because there's very few people that I'm aware of

27:10.980 --> 27:13.860
 that do it the way Travis and Koga did.

27:13.860 --> 27:15.340
 May I ask you a question?

27:15.340 --> 27:16.180
 Yes.

27:17.220 --> 27:20.540
 The choice of standing Seinagi,

27:20.540 --> 27:23.620
 I should say this for your listeners.

27:23.620 --> 27:24.460
 They're probably thinking,

27:24.460 --> 27:26.860
 what the hell are these two guys talking about?

27:26.860 --> 27:30.180
 Seinagi is one of the more high percentage throws

27:30.180 --> 27:31.620
 in the Olympic sport of judo.

27:32.660 --> 27:36.300
 Probably Uchimata is probably number one

27:36.300 --> 27:39.140
 and variations of Seinagi would be

27:39.140 --> 27:40.620
 in the top five for sure.

27:41.740 --> 27:44.700
 The basic choice you have in modern competition

27:44.700 --> 27:47.900
 is the more difficult standing Seinagi

27:47.900 --> 27:49.980
 where you literally are up on your feet

27:49.980 --> 27:52.340
 and you perform a shoulder throw

27:52.340 --> 27:55.740
 that takes your opponent over from a full standing position.

27:55.740 --> 27:59.260
 The most popular form of Seinagi

27:59.260 --> 28:01.100
 in modern competition by a landslide

28:01.100 --> 28:02.460
 is not the standing version.

28:02.460 --> 28:05.540
 It's a drop Seinagi where you go down to your knees.

28:05.540 --> 28:08.500
 This means you have a much easier time

28:08.500 --> 28:10.500
 getting underneath your opponent's center of gravity.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.500
 The defining feature of any Seinagi

28:12.500 --> 28:14.820
 is getting underneath your opponent's center of gravity

28:14.820 --> 28:15.660
 and lifting them.

28:15.660 --> 28:18.500
 Seoi literally means to lift and carry.

28:21.340 --> 28:23.580
 Why did you choose the more difficult version?

28:23.580 --> 28:24.740
 What was your motivation?

28:24.740 --> 28:26.900
 You know, you're a smart kid.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.700
 You know right from the start

28:28.700 --> 28:30.340
 that for every standing Seinagi,

28:30.340 --> 28:32.660
 there's 20 drop Seinagis in modern competition.

28:32.660 --> 28:34.860
 One is obviously more high percentage.

28:34.860 --> 28:39.380
 One obviously works for a wider variety of body types.

28:39.380 --> 28:41.300
 The number of people who are successful

28:41.300 --> 28:43.860
 with standing Seinagi is dramatically lower.

28:44.700 --> 28:47.660
 And it appears to be a move which is completely absent

28:47.660 --> 28:49.980
 in the heavyweight divisions

28:49.980 --> 28:53.340
 and rarely seen in the lightweight divisions.

28:53.340 --> 28:55.180
 Why?

28:55.180 --> 28:56.900
 What was the motivation?

28:56.900 --> 29:00.100
 Why did you willingly adopt the less high percentage

29:00.100 --> 29:01.820
 over the more high percentage?

29:01.820 --> 29:04.860
 And this would be very interesting.

29:04.860 --> 29:06.460
 I would love you to break it apart

29:06.460 --> 29:09.300
 because I apply the same kind of thinking

29:09.300 --> 29:10.380
 to basically everything.

29:10.380 --> 29:11.460
 I mentioned to you offline,

29:11.460 --> 29:14.940
 there's these Boston Dynamics Spot Robots.

29:14.940 --> 29:17.260
 When I first met Spot, I fell in love.

29:18.140 --> 29:20.620
 I don't understand what exactly,

29:20.620 --> 29:22.700
 but there's magic there.

29:22.700 --> 29:24.580
 And I just got excited by it.

29:24.580 --> 29:26.460
 And that fire burns.

29:26.460 --> 29:27.700
 I wanna work with these robots.

29:27.700 --> 29:29.660
 I wanna work with the robots.

29:29.660 --> 29:33.620
 I want to, I felt like there's something special there

29:33.620 --> 29:36.500
 that I could build something interesting with,

29:36.500 --> 29:38.100
 create something interesting with.

29:38.100 --> 29:41.300
 And the same with the standing Seinagi

29:41.300 --> 29:43.100
 from Koga and Travis.

29:43.100 --> 29:44.820
 I just fell in love with that technique.

29:44.820 --> 29:45.660
 Just even watching,

29:45.660 --> 29:47.820
 I didn't even know what the hell to do with it.

29:47.820 --> 29:49.580
 Was it aesthetic?

29:49.580 --> 29:51.940
 The standing Seinagi is more beautiful in execution.

29:51.940 --> 29:52.780
 There's no question.

29:52.780 --> 29:57.780
 In my own, we're talking about love here, right?

29:58.060 --> 30:01.300
 In my own definition of aesthetic, yes.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.380
 It's not just beauty.

30:02.380 --> 30:05.500
 Cause you could argue there's more elegant sort of Uchimata

30:05.500 --> 30:07.300
 is very beautiful and effortless.

30:07.300 --> 30:11.780
 I love something about the dominance of it.

30:11.780 --> 30:16.780
 I love the idea in sport of two people

30:17.500 --> 30:19.820
 that are the best in the world.

30:19.820 --> 30:23.100
 And one of them dominating the other.

30:23.100 --> 30:27.860
 And to me, the standing Seinagi, you're lifted off your feet

30:27.860 --> 30:31.780
 and especially when it's done perfectly

30:32.780 --> 30:37.220
 and with really strong resistance from the other person,

30:37.220 --> 30:40.140
 it results in a big slam.

30:40.140 --> 30:41.860
 And that was like beautiful to me.

30:41.860 --> 30:45.580
 That's the Alexander Karelian like big pickups.

30:45.580 --> 30:46.700
 I love that.

30:46.700 --> 30:50.020
 It's interesting, you're correct in so far as

30:50.020 --> 30:52.220
 you're not just going with aesthetic

30:52.220 --> 30:54.820
 and the sense of beauty, but also,

30:54.820 --> 30:59.220
 but you are making as it were value judgments

30:59.220 --> 31:00.060
 about the throw.

31:00.060 --> 31:01.820
 And that's fascinating to me

31:04.100 --> 31:09.020
 because there's two elements to any grappling sport.

31:09.020 --> 31:12.660
 I'm always insistent upon the idea

31:12.660 --> 31:16.100
 that Jiu Jitsu is both an art and a science, okay?

31:16.100 --> 31:18.900
 It has scientific elements in so far as it works

31:18.900 --> 31:20.100
 according to the laws of physics

31:20.100 --> 31:22.340
 and lever and fulcrum, et cetera, et cetera.

31:24.300 --> 31:28.020
 But it also has an aesthetic element

31:28.020 --> 31:31.220
 in so far as you're making choices with technique.

31:31.220 --> 31:33.700
 You're expressing who you are as a person.

31:33.700 --> 31:37.700
 You have 10,000 different variations of moves you could use,

31:37.700 --> 31:39.780
 but you're specifically choosing these.

31:39.780 --> 31:42.780
 That's an element of choice and self expression on your part.

31:42.780 --> 31:44.220
 And in so far as that is true,

31:44.220 --> 31:45.940
 combat sports are not just a science,

31:45.940 --> 31:47.340
 but they're also an art.

31:47.340 --> 31:49.820
 So most combat sports have this sense

31:49.820 --> 31:53.180
 which they have the features of both an art and a science.

31:53.180 --> 31:58.180
 And it's not just about high percentage in your case.

31:59.540 --> 32:02.500
 I mean, me personally, I'm obsessed with percentages.

32:02.500 --> 32:03.340
 What are the ways to make you win?

32:03.340 --> 32:04.380
 That's the science part.

32:04.380 --> 32:08.140
 Yeah, but that's also choices involved, yeah.

32:08.140 --> 32:13.140
 But there is an undeniably aesthetic element

32:13.140 --> 32:17.540
 to martial arts where you, as it were,

32:17.540 --> 32:20.660
 express who you are as a person

32:20.660 --> 32:23.260
 in terms of the techniques you're ultimately going to choose.

32:23.260 --> 32:24.700
 Does that get in the way?

32:24.700 --> 32:26.740
 Do you allow yourself to enjoy

32:26.740 --> 32:28.620
 the aesthetic beauty of a technique?

32:28.620 --> 32:30.140
 Of course, yeah.

32:30.140 --> 32:32.940
 When martial arts are done well,

32:32.940 --> 32:35.460
 it's the most beautiful sport in the world, okay?

32:35.460 --> 32:37.380
 When it's done poorly, it's the ugliest.

32:37.380 --> 32:43.900
 But a beautifully applied submission hold, a perfect throw,

32:43.900 --> 32:47.740
 a superbly set up takedown are among

32:47.740 --> 32:51.860
 the most difficult techniques to execute in all of sports.

32:51.860 --> 32:54.860
 And when they're done well, they're magic to observe.

32:54.860 --> 32:57.460
 But do you prefer certain techniques over others

32:57.460 --> 33:00.100
 because of their, like for example,

33:00.100 --> 33:03.580
 I'll tell you, for me, chokes of all sorts

33:03.580 --> 33:04.740
 with the gi, without the gi,

33:04.740 --> 33:10.660
 probably with the gi is the most beautiful to me, personally.

33:10.660 --> 33:13.980
 I value them above all others.

33:13.980 --> 33:17.620
 People mostly associate myself and my students with leg locking.

33:17.620 --> 33:19.260
 They're usually rather surprised to learn

33:19.260 --> 33:25.060
 that I actually value strangle holds far above leg locks.

33:25.060 --> 33:28.500
 But not for aesthetic reasons, for effectiveness.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.620
 We can talk about that later if you wish.

33:30.620 --> 33:33.300
 Well, let's step back.

33:33.300 --> 33:36.340
 Sorry, we drifted awfully far off topic there.

33:36.340 --> 33:38.860
 I think this is beautiful.

33:38.860 --> 33:43.300
 We drifted along the river of life and martial arts.

33:43.300 --> 33:46.260
 Can you explain the fundamentals of jiu jitsu?

33:46.260 --> 33:51.380
 Yes. If I couldn't, I wouldn't be much of a coach.

33:51.380 --> 33:56.420
 Jiu jitsu is an art and science

33:56.420 --> 34:00.820
 which looks to use a combination of tactical

34:00.820 --> 34:05.700
 and mechanical advantage to focus a very high percentage

34:05.700 --> 34:09.380
 of my strength against a very low percentage

34:09.380 --> 34:13.700
 of my opponent's strength at a critical point on their body,

34:13.700 --> 34:15.940
 such that if I were to exert my strength

34:15.940 --> 34:17.420
 upon that critical point,

34:17.420 --> 34:22.740
 they could no longer continue to fight.

34:22.740 --> 34:27.580
 Well, that's about weapons and defenses.

34:27.580 --> 34:30.860
 But then, is there something more to be said

34:30.860 --> 34:33.940
 about the set of tools that we're talking about?

34:33.940 --> 34:35.300
 That's where the art comes in.

34:35.300 --> 34:38.020
 Because ultimately, you have a set of choices,

34:38.020 --> 34:40.380
 and those choices that you make will be an act

34:40.380 --> 34:42.260
 of self expression on your part.

34:42.260 --> 34:46.100
 Some will prefer this, some will prefer that.

34:46.100 --> 34:48.340
 That's where you come in as an individual.

34:48.340 --> 34:52.060
 That's an overall definition of jiu jitsu,

34:52.060 --> 34:59.340
 of being a set of choices that where you're using

34:59.340 --> 35:02.620
 the things you're powerful in versus the things

35:02.620 --> 35:04.540
 your opponent is weak in.

35:04.540 --> 35:07.700
 No, I was only talking about percentages of body strength.

35:07.700 --> 35:12.020
 If I have, for example, let's say we have two athletes,

35:12.020 --> 35:13.900
 athlete A and athlete B.

35:13.900 --> 35:16.980
 Athlet A has 100 units of strength,

35:16.980 --> 35:18.900
 however we define that overall.

35:18.900 --> 35:20.900
 Athlet B has 50.

35:20.900 --> 35:26.300
 OK, so ostensibly, athlete A is twice as strong as athlete B.

35:26.300 --> 35:29.420
 But athlete B can maneuver his body

35:29.420 --> 35:34.340
 into a set of positions focused around a critical point

35:34.340 --> 35:38.900
 of his opponent's body, where he can apply 40 units of strength

35:38.900 --> 35:41.180
 out of his total of 50.

35:41.180 --> 35:44.780
 His opponent can only defend with 20 units of strength

35:44.780 --> 35:47.020
 out of his total of 100.

35:47.020 --> 35:51.740
 You have now completely reversed the strength discrepancy.

35:51.740 --> 35:54.700
 Originally, athlete A was twice as strong as B.

35:54.700 --> 35:57.820
 Now, on that one localized point, the knee, the elbow,

35:57.820 --> 36:01.100
 the neck, B is now twice as strong as A.

36:01.100 --> 36:04.540
 Under those circumstances, B should win.

36:04.540 --> 36:07.980
 I guess what I'm trying to get at, by the way,

36:07.980 --> 36:12.420
 that's really beautifully said, is what you just said

36:12.420 --> 36:16.940
 could be applied to other games, other battles.

36:16.940 --> 36:19.060
 It could be applied to the game of chess.

36:19.060 --> 36:22.420
 It could be applied to war, most obviously in war.

36:22.420 --> 36:26.940
 I think about, for example, the American strategic bombing

36:26.940 --> 36:30.100
 campaign in World War II.

36:30.100 --> 36:32.220
 The Eighth Army Air Force was tasked

36:32.220 --> 36:34.340
 with the idea of destroying German industry.

36:37.100 --> 36:39.380
 Did they attack all of German industry?

36:39.380 --> 36:40.140
 Of course not.

36:40.140 --> 36:41.980
 That would be stupid.

36:41.980 --> 36:45.300
 They attacked the ball bearing industry.

36:45.300 --> 36:46.620
 Why?

36:46.620 --> 36:51.180
 Because almost all of modern machines

36:51.180 --> 36:54.820
 require ball bearings in order to operate.

36:54.820 --> 36:56.900
 In order for the mechanical interfaces of machines

36:56.900 --> 36:58.620
 to operate, you have to reduce friction.

36:58.620 --> 37:01.020
 It's done through ball bearings.

37:01.020 --> 37:06.020
 If you knocked out one tiny component of German industry,

37:06.020 --> 37:09.980
 the ball bearing industry, the rest of it couldn't operate.

37:09.980 --> 37:11.580
 So too with the human body.

37:11.580 --> 37:13.300
 I didn't have to fight your whole body.

37:13.300 --> 37:15.780
 I just have to fight your left knee.

37:15.780 --> 37:17.780
 If I can break your left knee, the rest of your body

37:17.780 --> 37:19.620
 is irrelevant to me.

37:19.620 --> 37:24.620
 But then isn't the art of jiu jitsu discovering

37:24.620 --> 37:29.620
 the left knee, discovering the weak points?

37:29.980 --> 37:32.540
 Yeah, a huge part of jiu jitsu is understanding

37:32.540 --> 37:35.220
 the strengths and weaknesses of the human body.

37:35.220 --> 37:38.780
 There's parts of the human body that are shockingly robust

37:38.780 --> 37:41.500
 and there are other parts that are shockingly vulnerable.

37:41.500 --> 37:45.180
 The major joints, and of course the most vulnerable of all,

37:45.180 --> 37:46.540
 the unprotected neck.

37:46.540 --> 37:49.660
 So if we take something I'm not familiar with

37:49.660 --> 37:52.900
 but I was incredibly impressed by is the body lock

37:52.900 --> 37:57.900
 that I saw Nick Rodriguez use last time a few weeks ago.

38:00.980 --> 38:03.820
 But then I also got to hang out with Craig Jones

38:03.820 --> 38:04.660
 who showed that.

38:04.660 --> 38:06.620
 He also has a very good body lock.

38:06.620 --> 38:10.600
 So that was, I don't know if this body lock applies

38:10.600 --> 38:14.540
 to all positions, but I was seeing it from when Craig

38:14.540 --> 38:19.540
 is on top of the opponent and trying to pass in the guard,

38:22.300 --> 38:24.820
 use the body lock as a controlling position.

38:24.820 --> 38:28.500
 The principle behind it is that it shuts down,

38:28.500 --> 38:33.500
 as you've spoken about, it shuts down the weapons

38:34.060 --> 38:36.220
 of a very strong opponent.

38:36.220 --> 38:37.220
 That's absolutely correct.

38:37.220 --> 38:42.220
 In the case of guard position, what makes guard position

38:42.220 --> 38:47.220
 dangerous, what makes someone a powerful guard player

38:47.220 --> 38:49.540
 is the movement of their hips forward and backward

38:49.540 --> 38:50.460
 and side to side.

38:52.220 --> 38:56.020
 Body locking is designed to shut down that movement

38:56.020 --> 38:57.780
 and does a very fine job of it.

38:57.780 --> 38:59.780
 You'll see all of my students excel at it.

38:59.780 --> 39:02.920
 Gordon Ryan is probably the single best body lock

39:02.920 --> 39:04.200
 guard passer I've ever seen.

39:04.200 --> 39:05.980
 Nicky Ryan is outstanding with it.

39:05.980 --> 39:07.660
 Nick Rodriguez is very good.

39:07.660 --> 39:09.120
 Craig Jones is outstanding.

39:09.120 --> 39:12.820
 All of my students use this for a very simple reason.

39:12.820 --> 39:16.100
 Understand what is the central problem of shutting down

39:16.100 --> 39:18.940
 a dangerous guard player, it's his hips.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.420
 That's what makes him a dangerous leg locker.

39:20.420 --> 39:22.040
 You go up against a dangerous leg locker,

39:22.040 --> 39:25.440
 body lock guard pass, single best way to shut down

39:25.440 --> 39:26.540
 most of his entries.

39:28.420 --> 39:30.380
 We're all strong in leg locks.

39:30.380 --> 39:33.280
 So in our gym, you gotta control the hips

39:33.280 --> 39:34.900
 as soon as possible.

39:34.900 --> 39:36.320
 Otherwise it's gonna be a very difficult thing

39:36.320 --> 39:39.220
 to avoid leg entanglements as you go to pass.

39:39.220 --> 39:43.020
 And across the board, my students excel

39:43.020 --> 39:46.380
 in body lock guard passing.

39:47.560 --> 39:49.780
 They understand what's the most dangerous feature

39:49.780 --> 39:52.300
 their opponent has, the lateral movement of their hips.

39:52.300 --> 39:55.220
 What's the single best way to stop that body lock

39:55.220 --> 39:56.820
 and then work from there.

39:56.820 --> 40:01.140
 So if this asymmetry of power is fundamental to jiu jitsu,

40:01.140 --> 40:02.300
 how do you discover that?

40:02.300 --> 40:05.100
 How did you discover the body lock?

40:05.100 --> 40:09.220
 That as one of many methodologies

40:09.220 --> 40:11.300
 of achieving this asymmetry.

40:11.300 --> 40:12.700
 It would be an overstatement to say

40:12.700 --> 40:14.220
 we discovered the body lock.

40:14.220 --> 40:16.260
 Body lock passing has been around longer

40:16.260 --> 40:17.900
 than we've been around.

40:18.860 --> 40:20.920
 But what I would say is that in a room full

40:20.920 --> 40:23.080
 of dangerous leg lockers, you've gotta have a way

40:23.080 --> 40:25.060
 to shut down the hips.

40:25.060 --> 40:28.460
 And so once we started using body locks,

40:28.460 --> 40:30.260
 we saw that was one excellent way

40:30.260 --> 40:32.200
 to get around that problem.

40:32.200 --> 40:37.200
 But as with all development, it comes from trial and error.

40:37.320 --> 40:40.780
 You will often see people teach the technique

40:40.780 --> 40:43.760
 to a certain level and you see the teaching,

40:43.760 --> 40:45.800
 you're like, there's a lot of inadequacies there.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.880
 And that doesn't cover a lot of the problems

40:47.880 --> 40:49.120
 that we're encountering.

40:49.120 --> 40:52.260
 And so trial and error is the single most important part

40:52.260 --> 40:53.920
 of the development.

40:53.920 --> 40:55.560
 Trial and error in?

40:56.700 --> 40:58.640
 In the training room amongst ourselves.

40:58.640 --> 41:01.520
 In hard training or?

41:01.520 --> 41:04.920
 No, it never begins with hard training or everything.

41:04.920 --> 41:08.000
 Techniques are born the same way we're born.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.840
 Weak and in need of nutrition.

41:13.240 --> 41:16.880
 You have to build them up organically like children.

41:16.880 --> 41:18.800
 And you start with minimal resistance

41:18.800 --> 41:20.560
 and you make progress over time.

41:20.560 --> 41:22.800
 When you first go to the gym, do you put 500 pounds

41:22.800 --> 41:24.720
 on the bench press and try to bench press it?

41:24.720 --> 41:25.960
 No, you'll be killed.

41:25.960 --> 41:29.080
 You start off with the bar, you build over time

41:29.080 --> 41:30.880
 and then one day, five years from now,

41:30.880 --> 41:33.200
 you really are lifting 500 pounds.

41:33.200 --> 41:36.200
 But only a forward attempt, they're on their first attempt.

41:38.120 --> 41:41.840
 And they're born like children in your mind first?

41:41.840 --> 41:43.680
 Like there's a spark of an idea.

41:43.680 --> 41:45.040
 Yes, there's always a spark.

41:45.040 --> 41:48.320
 It's like scientific development on a subject matter

41:48.320 --> 41:51.340
 which is intrinsically simpler.

41:51.340 --> 41:56.340
 Okay, there's a sense in which naive

41:56.560 --> 41:58.960
 and overly simplistic assessments

41:58.960 --> 42:01.560
 of scientific method may not work well

42:01.560 --> 42:03.920
 at advanced levels of science, but they work damn well

42:03.920 --> 42:05.440
 in the training room with jiu jitsu

42:05.440 --> 42:08.800
 where the subject matter is inherently simpler

42:08.800 --> 42:10.840
 than it is in research science.

42:10.840 --> 42:15.320
 And as a result, there'll be a spark.

42:15.320 --> 42:17.760
 You'll see something, there's possibilities there.

42:17.760 --> 42:21.400
 Okay, let's puzzle this out, let's work with this.

42:21.400 --> 42:24.000
 And you run into a lot of failures.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.340
 You've suddenly been, oh man, if I put my hip this way,

42:27.340 --> 42:28.180
 this works really well.

42:28.180 --> 42:29.280
 And then suddenly you just try and spar

42:29.280 --> 42:31.320
 and you get caught in a simple, normal platter.

42:31.320 --> 42:32.600
 And you're like, okay, that didn't work as well

42:32.600 --> 42:33.520
 as I thought.

42:33.520 --> 42:35.520
 And then you look to rectify things.

42:35.520 --> 42:38.080
 If things go in promising research directions,

42:38.080 --> 42:38.920
 you keep them.

42:38.920 --> 42:41.040
 If not, you discard them.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.320
 Well, it's funny you say science.

42:42.320 --> 42:44.240
 It feels more like art.

42:44.240 --> 42:46.480
 There's somebody I really admire

42:46.480 --> 42:48.440
 that talks about this kind of ideas.

42:48.440 --> 42:51.600
 Johnny I from Apple, he's the lead designer.

42:51.600 --> 42:54.160
 He recently left, but he was the designer

42:54.160 --> 42:57.520
 behind most of the products we know and love from Apple.

42:57.520 --> 43:00.040
 When you say designer, be more precise.

43:00.040 --> 43:02.640
 What exactly was he working on in Apple?

43:03.680 --> 43:05.240
 The iPhone.

43:05.240 --> 43:07.760
 Which parts of the iPhone did he work on?

43:07.760 --> 43:09.640
 The entirety of it.

43:09.640 --> 43:12.520
 Was he a leader of a research team

43:12.520 --> 43:14.800
 or was he the person personally responsible

43:14.800 --> 43:15.720
 for the development?

43:15.720 --> 43:20.720
 He's kind of, I would say, very similar to your position.

43:22.200 --> 43:25.960
 He wasn't necessarily the last, the person executing

43:25.960 --> 43:27.760
 the fine, the manufacturer, right?

43:27.760 --> 43:28.600
 Yeah, of course.

43:28.600 --> 43:33.160
 But there's the, he's somebody that's very hands on.

43:33.160 --> 43:37.120
 And it's like, okay, so he worked obviously

43:37.120 --> 43:38.960
 extremely close to Steve Jobs.

43:38.960 --> 43:41.100
 Steve Jobs has this idea.

43:41.100 --> 43:42.840
 We should have a computer that's as thin

43:42.840 --> 43:45.520
 as a sheet of paper, and then you start to play

43:45.520 --> 43:48.360
 with ideas of like, what does that actually look like?

43:48.360 --> 43:51.680
 The reason I bring it up is because he talked about,

43:51.680 --> 43:54.980
 he had these ideas that he would not tell Steve

43:54.980 --> 43:58.200
 because he talked about in the same exact language

43:58.200 --> 44:01.800
 as you're saying, is there's like a little baby

44:01.800 --> 44:04.020
 that it's very fragile.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.360
 It needs time to grow.

44:07.360 --> 44:08.200
 Absolutely.

44:08.200 --> 44:10.600
 And then Steve Jobs would often roll in.

44:10.600 --> 44:11.560
 Was too ruthless?

44:11.560 --> 44:12.640
 Too ruthless.

44:12.640 --> 44:15.240
 This is, he would destroy ideas.

44:15.240 --> 44:19.680
 Because Johnny Ive and the team didn't have

44:19.680 --> 44:23.480
 actually good responses to the criticism at first.

44:23.480 --> 44:27.360
 Because when they're babies, you can't defend the baby.

44:27.360 --> 44:29.520
 But you need a time to develop.

44:29.520 --> 44:30.800
 You need to sleep on it.

44:30.800 --> 44:33.160
 You need to rethink it, dream things

44:33.160 --> 44:34.960
 and all those kinds of things.

44:34.960 --> 44:36.360
 It's fascinating you say this, Lex,

44:36.360 --> 44:39.700
 because this is actually the entire history

44:39.700 --> 44:43.660
 of scientific development is literally the story

44:43.660 --> 44:47.440
 of the juxtaposition between the need to protect

44:47.440 --> 44:50.880
 and nurture new theories versus the need

44:50.880 --> 44:54.360
 to rigorously test them with harsh testing

44:54.360 --> 44:58.120
 that either verifies them or falsifies them.

44:58.120 --> 45:01.140
 And learning to find a satisfactory compromise

45:01.140 --> 45:04.180
 between those two is a very, very difficult thing.

45:04.180 --> 45:06.660
 When you look at the history of science,

45:06.660 --> 45:10.560
 you will see that there's some pretty damn chaotic moments

45:10.560 --> 45:12.920
 anytime there's major theory change

45:12.920 --> 45:21.160
 where all kinds of apparently undesirable tricks

45:21.160 --> 45:23.360
 are used to protect certain theories

45:23.360 --> 45:25.960
 with ad hoc hypotheses, et cetera, et cetera.

45:25.960 --> 45:34.400
 And ultimately, only time and success over time

45:34.400 --> 45:36.480
 will justify a theory.

45:36.480 --> 45:39.000
 There's usually a period where when one theory goes in

45:39.000 --> 45:41.100
 to replace another, there's something

45:41.100 --> 45:44.720
 of a battle between competing groups of scientists, some

45:44.720 --> 45:47.840
 of whom advocate theory A, some who advocate theory B.

45:47.840 --> 45:52.140
 They often use seemingly unscrupulous methods

45:52.140 --> 45:54.400
 to protect or attack another person's theory.

45:54.400 --> 45:56.000
 They dig for proofs.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.100
 And usually, some period of time has to go by.

45:59.100 --> 46:00.920
 Sometimes, in some cases, it simply

46:00.920 --> 46:03.800
 involved older scientists protecting an initial theory

46:03.800 --> 46:09.080
 dying off and new scientists just replacing them

46:09.080 --> 46:10.240
 with numbers.

46:10.240 --> 46:13.840
 And this is a common, common theme.

46:13.840 --> 46:16.320
 And the same applies in jiu jitsu.

46:16.320 --> 46:18.760
 So many times, especially when I first

46:18.760 --> 46:22.960
 started working with leg locks, I would show things

46:22.960 --> 46:28.640
 I had worked on to even world champion black belts.

46:28.640 --> 46:31.840
 And they would try it once or twice and fail and be like,

46:31.840 --> 46:33.880
 yeah, it doesn't work.

46:33.880 --> 46:37.920
 And I'd be like, you tried it once on another guy who's

46:37.920 --> 46:42.440
 also a world champion who has a strong ability to resist it.

46:42.440 --> 46:43.880
 And that's it.

46:43.880 --> 46:44.400
 No more.

46:44.400 --> 46:45.480
 It doesn't work.

46:45.480 --> 46:47.960
 And then five years later, they would

46:47.960 --> 46:52.000
 see my students finishing world champions with it.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.400
 And in some cases, finishing the very people

46:54.400 --> 46:57.720
 who said that the technique would never work.

46:57.720 --> 47:01.400
 I mean, if there was ever a refutation of a statement,

47:01.400 --> 47:05.000
 that's a pretty clear example.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.240
 And there has to be a sense in which you

47:08.240 --> 47:09.720
 can't be too forgiving.

47:09.720 --> 47:11.800
 You have to test hypotheses.

47:11.800 --> 47:14.040
 But on the other hand, you can't be too ruthless either.

47:14.040 --> 47:17.760
 You have to look for promise.

47:17.760 --> 47:22.080
 And my advice is start slow.

47:22.080 --> 47:23.920
 Again, the analogy of lifting weights.

47:23.920 --> 47:26.300
 You don't lift the heaviest weights on your first day.

47:26.300 --> 47:26.800
 You build up.

47:26.800 --> 47:30.000
 You work progressively over time.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.680
 Now, you also have to have some common sense here.

47:32.680 --> 47:35.200
 You can't be too forgiving to a technique

47:35.200 --> 47:38.960
 if it's repeatedly failing and good people have tried it

47:38.960 --> 47:40.720
 and multiple good people have tried it

47:40.720 --> 47:43.000
 and it's just not working out, then, OK, it's

47:43.000 --> 47:44.240
 time to dismiss it.

47:44.240 --> 47:46.440
 But don't be too quick.

47:46.440 --> 47:50.920
 Is this where your idea of training with lower belts

47:50.920 --> 47:52.680
 quite a bit comes from?

47:52.680 --> 47:54.280
 I've actually just, as a side comment,

47:54.280 --> 48:00.000
 and maybe you can elaborate, the place, the gym,

48:00.000 --> 48:02.800
 Balanced Studios with Phil and Rick McGarry's where I got

48:02.800 --> 48:05.240
 my black belt, where I grew up as a jujitsu person

48:05.240 --> 48:08.680
 in Philadelphia, they have a huge number of black belts,

48:08.680 --> 48:13.080
 but they have a huge number of all other ranks.

48:13.080 --> 48:16.120
 And the way they picked sparring partners,

48:16.120 --> 48:18.160
 people you train with, is very ad hoc.

48:18.160 --> 48:18.920
 It's very loose.

48:18.920 --> 48:21.680
 It's one of those places, one of those gyms

48:21.680 --> 48:25.920
 where you can train for like three, four hours.

48:25.920 --> 48:29.520
 And you could take a break or you could jump back in.

48:29.520 --> 48:30.480
 Very informal.

48:30.480 --> 48:32.600
 And you can go to war with black belts,

48:32.600 --> 48:34.760
 but then you can also play around

48:34.760 --> 48:37.120
 with the purple and the blue belts and so on.

48:37.120 --> 48:39.360
 And that was really beneficial for growth.

48:39.360 --> 48:43.080
 And you can pick which, because everybody has a style,

48:43.080 --> 48:45.920
 and you can pick which style you really want to work on.

48:45.920 --> 48:51.680
 And then I came to Boston, Broadway Jiu Jitsu,

48:51.680 --> 48:53.280
 with John Clark, who I love.

48:53.280 --> 48:54.440
 He's a good friend.

48:54.440 --> 48:58.160
 But it's a little bit more formal.

48:58.160 --> 49:01.000
 And I found myself, it was a very interesting journey.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.880
 I would be training with black belts the whole time.

49:03.880 --> 49:07.960
 And it was a very different experience.

49:07.960 --> 49:10.640
 I found myself exploring much less.

49:10.640 --> 49:14.000
 I found myself learning much less.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.280
 I mean, part of that is on me,

49:16.280 --> 49:20.240
 but part of it was also realizing that,

49:20.240 --> 49:23.480
 wow, there's a value to training with people

49:23.480 --> 49:24.960
 that are much worse than you.

49:24.960 --> 49:28.400
 Yes, is there a philosophy you could speak to on that?

49:28.400 --> 49:31.680
 Yeah, you probably know it already.

49:31.680 --> 49:34.320
 You know from your studies in artificial intelligence

49:34.320 --> 49:37.560
 that all human beings are naturally risk averse.

49:37.560 --> 49:42.560
 This is a bias which is deeply seated in all of us.

49:42.560 --> 49:45.800
 I'm sure you're well read on people like Tversky and et

49:45.800 --> 49:48.920
 cetera, who talk about this all the time.

49:48.920 --> 49:52.480
 For your viewers, there are numerous psychological

49:52.480 --> 49:55.640
 experiments that are showing that most people,

49:55.640 --> 49:59.840
 to the point of irrationality, fear loss more

49:59.840 --> 50:04.880
 than they are excited at the prospect of an equivalent gain.

50:04.880 --> 50:08.200
 So for example, if you have $100 in your wallet,

50:08.200 --> 50:11.520
 you're more worried about the idea of losing the $100

50:11.520 --> 50:13.360
 that you have now than you would be

50:13.360 --> 50:17.480
 excited by the prospect of gaining $100 that I could

50:17.480 --> 50:18.480
 potentially offer you.

50:18.480 --> 50:22.520
 This comes out whenever you get black belt versus black belt

50:22.520 --> 50:27.240
 confrontations or any kind of similar skill level.

50:27.240 --> 50:31.080
 Whenever you get similar skill levels,

50:31.080 --> 50:34.720
 the chances of defeat get very, very high.

50:34.720 --> 50:36.320
 Interestingly, if you're a white belt

50:36.320 --> 50:38.200
 and you're going against a black belt, you'll take risk.

50:38.200 --> 50:39.200
 Why?

50:39.200 --> 50:40.960
 Because there's no shame in losing to a black belt

50:40.960 --> 50:41.960
 when you're a white belt.

50:41.960 --> 50:43.800
 So you'll play more lightheartedly

50:43.800 --> 50:45.800
 and you'll have a more fun role.

50:45.800 --> 50:49.400
 But when you have very similar skill levels,

50:49.400 --> 50:51.400
 you're going to come back to what?

50:51.400 --> 50:57.000
 The techniques that are most likely to get you a win.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.440
 That number of techniques is usually pretty small.

51:00.440 --> 51:04.880
 And if you're always battling with the same tough opponents

51:04.880 --> 51:08.400
 every day, where if you make even a single error,

51:08.400 --> 51:11.160
 it will cost you that match inspiring

51:11.160 --> 51:13.120
 and you don't like losing, you're

51:13.120 --> 51:17.080
 going to stay with a very small set of moves.

51:17.080 --> 51:20.200
 You might get slightly better at direct execution over time,

51:20.200 --> 51:22.960
 but you as an individual will not grow.

51:22.960 --> 51:28.120
 Growth, as it does in organic life forms,

51:28.120 --> 51:33.120
 comes from small beginnings and builds over time.

51:33.120 --> 51:36.640
 You can't take an untested, untried move

51:36.640 --> 51:39.040
 and get it on a world champion black belt.

51:39.040 --> 51:45.400
 It's going to get crushed, so it's not ready for that.

51:45.400 --> 51:48.560
 It's like a lion cub being thrown out

51:48.560 --> 51:50.600
 into the Serengeti plains.

51:50.600 --> 51:53.880
 A lion cub is just too small and too ineffective.

51:53.880 --> 51:56.400
 It's a lion, but it's a cub.

51:56.400 --> 51:58.080
 And it's not until it grows into maturity

51:58.080 --> 52:00.640
 that it can be a lion that can dominate the Serengeti plains.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.080
 That's why I always encourage my students to play

52:07.080 --> 52:11.760
 with a variety of belt types and spend

52:11.760 --> 52:15.600
 the majority of their time with lesser belts

52:15.600 --> 52:16.720
 for development purposes.

52:16.720 --> 52:18.480
 When you're getting closer to a competition,

52:18.480 --> 52:19.920
 you obviously want to change that.

52:19.920 --> 52:22.840
 You want to be getting more a competitive sense

52:22.840 --> 52:27.480
 of hard work, but you must learn to divide up your training

52:27.480 --> 52:31.840
 cycles into non competition cycles

52:31.840 --> 52:35.120
 where you're presumably working with people

52:35.120 --> 52:37.360
 who are slightly lower in level than yourself,

52:37.360 --> 52:40.360
 and in some cases, quite a bit lower than yourself.

52:40.360 --> 52:43.200
 And then competition cycles where

52:43.200 --> 52:46.800
 you're working with people much closer to your own skill level.

52:46.800 --> 52:50.040
 Is there something to be said about the flip side of that,

52:50.040 --> 52:54.240
 which is when you're training with people at the same skill

52:54.240 --> 52:57.520
 level, being OK losing to them?

52:57.520 --> 52:58.320
 Yes.

52:58.320 --> 53:01.000
 You have to see training for what it is.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.160
 Training is about skill development,

53:03.160 --> 53:04.800
 not about winning or losing.

53:04.800 --> 53:08.640
 You've got to understand that you

53:08.640 --> 53:10.800
 don't need to win every battle.

53:10.800 --> 53:13.600
 You only need to win the battles that count.

53:13.600 --> 53:16.400
 And the battles that count are in the world championship

53:16.400 --> 53:17.640
 finals.

53:17.640 --> 53:18.840
 That's the one that counts.

53:18.840 --> 53:20.720
 Think about that win.

53:20.720 --> 53:22.920
 That's the one you're going to be remembered for.

53:22.920 --> 53:24.920
 You're not going to be remembered for the battle you

53:24.920 --> 53:27.800
 lost on Tuesday afternoon at 3 PM in some nameless gym

53:27.800 --> 53:29.920
 with some guy that no one cares about.

53:29.920 --> 53:31.400
 No one's going to remember that.

53:31.400 --> 53:33.640
 You're going to be remembered for your peak performances,

53:33.640 --> 53:35.480
 not your everyday performances.

53:35.480 --> 53:38.720
 Focus your everyday performances on skill development

53:38.720 --> 53:43.960
 so that your peak performances you can focus on winning.

53:43.960 --> 53:48.800
 This is not a therapy session, but if I could just speak.

53:48.800 --> 53:52.040
 Every session's a therapy session.

53:52.040 --> 53:56.680
 There is still an ape thing in there.

53:56.680 --> 53:57.160
 Of course.

53:57.160 --> 53:59.600
 You think I don't feel it?

53:59.600 --> 54:02.200
 You think everyone in the room doesn't feel it?

54:02.200 --> 54:06.840
 Because, for example, you have never seen me roll.

54:06.840 --> 54:10.520
 When there's people, I've seen the look in people's eyes

54:10.520 --> 54:12.640
 when they see me train.

54:12.640 --> 54:16.080
 And I could see, maybe it's me projecting,

54:16.080 --> 54:18.880
 but they think, I thought you were supposed to be good.

54:18.880 --> 54:22.160
 I thought you were supposed to be a black belt.

54:22.160 --> 54:24.240
 That look, they're like studying.

54:24.240 --> 54:25.880
 I'm going to give you some therapy.

54:25.880 --> 54:26.400
 OK.

54:26.400 --> 54:32.600
 Do you know how many people have come up

54:32.600 --> 54:37.400
 to me over the years who have visited the training

54:37.400 --> 54:39.920
 halls that I work in, and they come up to me and they go,

54:39.920 --> 54:43.880
 man, I rolled with Gary Tonin.

54:43.880 --> 54:48.480
 I did really well with him, like really well.

54:48.480 --> 54:52.360
 I'm like, oh, that's very good, very impressive.

54:52.360 --> 54:55.680
 And then I see them talking to their friends, like, man,

54:55.680 --> 54:56.840
 I tapped out Gary Tonin.

54:59.800 --> 55:04.040
 And I'm sitting there going, yeah.

55:04.040 --> 55:06.960
 And you can see that they're just like, whoa, dude,

55:06.960 --> 55:10.040
 I'm way better than I thought I was.

55:10.040 --> 55:14.800
 Gary Tonin, all of my students, I

55:14.800 --> 55:19.160
 push them in the direction of giving up bad positions

55:19.160 --> 55:21.000
 so that they practice working, getting out

55:21.000 --> 55:22.080
 of critical situations.

55:22.080 --> 55:24.160
 It's a huge part of our training program.

55:24.160 --> 55:26.240
 But Gary Tonin takes that to a level

55:26.240 --> 55:28.360
 that just no one else even gets close.

55:28.360 --> 55:30.560
 It's just amazing.

55:30.560 --> 55:34.440
 He will put himself in impossible situations

55:34.440 --> 55:40.240
 where it's a fully locked strangle, 100% on with both

55:40.240 --> 55:42.280
 his arms behind his back.

55:42.280 --> 55:44.800
 And he'll try to work out from there.

55:44.800 --> 55:48.560
 And seven times out of 10, he does.

55:48.560 --> 55:52.960
 But three times out of 10, he gets caught.

55:52.960 --> 55:55.880
 I'm a huge advocate of handicap training,

55:55.880 --> 55:59.680
 where you handicap yourself to work on skills.

55:59.680 --> 56:04.360
 He's took that to heart to a level that few people, I

56:04.360 --> 56:05.720
 believe, can match.

56:05.720 --> 56:08.000
 I just wonder what his psychology is like, because there's.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.480
 It goes back to what we talked about before, Lex.

56:10.480 --> 56:13.640
 You have to understand it's skill development.

56:13.640 --> 56:16.280
 Don't take it personally.

56:16.280 --> 56:16.960
 I understand.

56:16.960 --> 56:18.400
 I hear where you're coming from.

56:18.400 --> 56:21.040
 We've all got what you call the ape reflex, where

56:21.040 --> 56:22.720
 we want to be dominant, OK?

56:22.720 --> 56:23.680
 We all do.

56:23.680 --> 56:25.680
 Because there's thousands of white belts out there

56:25.680 --> 56:28.880
 that have tapped Gary Tonan, and they're walking around,

56:28.880 --> 56:30.200
 and they're posting online.

56:30.200 --> 56:32.560
 I tapped Gary Tonan.

56:32.560 --> 56:34.400
 Gary Tonan's one of the best in the world,

56:34.400 --> 56:36.400
 so I'm one of the best in the world.

56:36.400 --> 56:40.200
 And does Gary get upset about this?

56:40.200 --> 56:41.080
 No, of course not.

56:41.080 --> 56:43.400
 Because Gary knows that when it counts on stage,

56:43.400 --> 56:46.720
 he's going to be going 100% with a set of skills

56:46.720 --> 56:49.600
 that very few people can match.

56:49.600 --> 56:53.920
 He can go into an EBI overtime at the 205 pound weight

56:53.920 --> 56:57.560
 division against an ADCC champion,

56:57.560 --> 57:00.600
 starting in a full arm lock position,

57:00.600 --> 57:04.680
 and effortlessly get out with no problems in seconds.

57:04.680 --> 57:08.960
 Because he's been in that situation 25,000 times

57:08.960 --> 57:12.760
 with varying degrees of skilled opponents.

57:12.760 --> 57:16.160
 And there's just no panic, no fear.

57:16.160 --> 57:20.280
 He's just doing what he's done so many thousands of times.

57:20.280 --> 57:24.200
 And that's a fine, fine example of a guy

57:24.200 --> 57:26.760
 who didn't give a damn what happened in the training room,

57:26.760 --> 57:30.560
 but when it counted on the stage, in front of the cameras,

57:30.560 --> 57:32.120
 it kicked in.

57:32.120 --> 57:35.360
 Yeah, he's an incredible inspiration, actually.

57:35.360 --> 57:38.400
 He's a practitioner of something you've recently

57:38.400 --> 57:40.560
 talked quite a bit about, which is the power

57:40.560 --> 57:43.180
 of escaping sort of bad positions.

57:43.180 --> 57:46.340
 I think you've talked about it,

57:46.340 --> 57:47.900
 which is really interesting framing,

57:47.900 --> 57:52.900
 is escaping bad positions is one of the best ways,

57:54.140 --> 57:58.740
 if not the best way, to demonstrate dominance

57:58.740 --> 58:01.340
 psychologically over your opponent.

58:01.340 --> 58:04.020
 That anything they throw at you,

58:05.180 --> 58:07.540
 like their weapons are useless against you.

58:08.700 --> 58:10.260
 There's a little bit of Lex Friedman

58:10.260 --> 58:11.740
 kicking through on this question.

58:11.740 --> 58:16.740
 Your obsession with dominance is skewing your point of view.

58:16.740 --> 58:19.380
 It's a therapy session, it's a therapy session.

58:19.380 --> 58:22.420
 I'm coming from a wrestling perspective.

58:22.420 --> 58:23.980
 I think it's not just Lex Friedman.

58:23.980 --> 58:25.020
 I think it's Dan Gable.

58:25.020 --> 58:26.900
 I think it's dominant.

58:26.900 --> 58:31.160
 The Gary Tonin ethic, it just goes against everything

58:31.160 --> 58:32.300
 wrestling is about.

58:32.300 --> 58:35.600
 You never put yourself in a bad position.

58:35.600 --> 58:39.700
 And the fact, it's a, philosophically,

58:39.700 --> 58:40.780
 I don't know what to do with it.

58:40.780 --> 58:45.720
 It's a total reframing of showing dominance

58:45.720 --> 58:49.060
 by escaping any bad position.

58:49.060 --> 58:49.900
 Yeah.

58:49.900 --> 58:53.580
 Let's talk about the idea of what is the value of escapes?

58:53.580 --> 58:56.820
 Why do I put this in as the first skill

58:56.820 --> 58:59.840
 that every Jiu Jitsu student must master?

59:01.540 --> 59:05.380
 Believe it or not, when I talked about how it

59:07.780 --> 59:09.280
 pertains to dominance,

59:09.280 --> 59:11.380
 that's its smallest value.

59:12.320 --> 59:14.980
 Its greatest value has nothing to do with dominance.

59:14.980 --> 59:16.480
 It has to do with confidence.

59:19.300 --> 59:22.540
 You can train someone and teach them technique

59:22.540 --> 59:24.260
 until you're blue in the face.

59:25.420 --> 59:29.340
 But at some point, the athlete in question

59:29.340 --> 59:33.460
 has to go out there on the stage and pull the trigger

59:33.460 --> 59:34.720
 when the time is right.

59:34.720 --> 59:37.720
 What's going to give you that ability

59:37.720 --> 59:41.960
 to go from the physical skills that you've learned

59:41.960 --> 59:45.720
 to execution under pressure is confidence.

59:51.960 --> 59:54.160
 I always talk about skill development.

59:54.160 --> 59:57.320
 And yes, skill development is the absolute bedrock

59:57.320 --> 59:58.760
 of my training programs.

59:58.760 --> 1:00:02.680
 But you can't finish at that level.

1:00:02.680 --> 1:00:04.840
 There has to be something more than that.

1:00:04.840 --> 1:00:08.280
 And you have to go from the physical element of skill

1:00:08.280 --> 1:00:11.280
 into the psychological element of confidence.

1:00:11.280 --> 1:00:14.680
 I can teach you an armbar all day.

1:00:14.680 --> 1:00:17.760
 You can get to a point where you can flawlessly execute

1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:20.840
 armbars in drilling and even in a certain level

1:00:20.840 --> 1:00:21.680
 of competition.

1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:25.480
 But if you believe that you can do it,

1:00:25.480 --> 1:00:29.200
 in a certain level of competition, but if you believe

1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:34.720
 that in attempting an armbar on a dangerous opponent

1:00:34.720 --> 1:00:36.280
 with good guard passing skills,

1:00:36.280 --> 1:00:38.880
 say the armbar has been performed from guard position,

1:00:40.440 --> 1:00:45.440
 that if the armbar fails and your opponent uses that failure

1:00:45.880 --> 1:00:49.400
 to set up a strong pass and get into a side pin,

1:00:49.400 --> 1:00:53.000
 possibly into the mount, and you don't have the ability

1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.800
 to get out of that side pin or mount,

1:00:55.800 --> 1:00:58.400
 you won't pull the trigger on the armbar.

1:00:58.400 --> 1:01:02.480
 And so even though you had all the requisite physical skills

1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:06.120
 to perform the technique, when push came to shove

1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:10.720
 and the critical moment came, you backed down.

1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:12.120
 You didn't pull the trigger.

1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:17.720
 Building that confidence is the key

1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:19.880
 to championship performance.

1:01:19.880 --> 1:01:24.720
 And the single best way to do it is to take away

1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:29.520
 the innate fear that we all have of bad outcomes

1:01:29.520 --> 1:01:33.320
 that makes us naturally risk averse.

1:01:33.320 --> 1:01:35.840
 When you don't believe you can be pinned,

1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:38.240
 when you don't believe your guard can be passed,

1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:41.160
 you'll take risks because there's no downside

1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:42.600
 to your actions.

1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:46.120
 An unpinnable person and an unpassable person

1:01:46.120 --> 1:01:48.760
 doesn't have much to fear in a jiu jitsu match.

1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:51.640
 You can come out and fire with all guns blazing

1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:53.280
 because then you know at the end of the day,

1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:54.480
 no one's gonna hold you down,

1:01:54.480 --> 1:01:56.400
 no one's gonna pass you guard.

1:01:56.400 --> 1:01:58.840
 That's your first two goals in jiu jitsu.

1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:00.480
 They're the most boring goals.

1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:01.560
 They're not exciting to learn.

1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:03.560
 No one wants to come in and their first thing we're told,

1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:04.760
 okay, you're gonna practice escapes

1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:06.080
 for the next year of your life.

1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:08.240
 Okay, it's not going, are you kidding me?

1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:11.360
 But that's what you gotta have, that's your first skill.

1:02:11.360 --> 1:02:14.080
 And that's what I push upon all of my students.

1:02:14.080 --> 1:02:17.440
 You'll see almost all of them are very, very strong

1:02:17.440 --> 1:02:18.680
 in escape skills.

1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:21.080
 They know that if things go wrong,

1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:22.760
 they can always get out.

1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:25.000
 They can always live to fight another day.

1:02:26.280 --> 1:02:28.320
 And that is what gives them the ability

1:02:28.320 --> 1:02:30.000
 to attack without fear.

1:02:31.440 --> 1:02:34.720
 I think that is so profound and so rare.

1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:37.680
 It's so rare to hear this.

1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:40.480
 I think it's because it's the most painful thing to do.

1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:43.040
 Always ask yourself,

1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:46.640
 when you enter a jiu jitsu match,

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:51.360
 you already know ahead of time,

1:02:52.800 --> 1:02:55.520
 if you're going to lose, how you're going to lose.

1:02:56.680 --> 1:02:59.880
 Okay, there's only a certain number of realistic submissions

1:02:59.880 --> 1:03:01.040
 that work in the sport of jiu jitsu.

1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:03.240
 The number is very small.

1:03:03.240 --> 1:03:06.480
 So ahead of time, you already know

1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:09.760
 the most likely methods of submission loss in jiu jitsu

1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:11.480
 are gonna be things like heel hook,

1:03:11.480 --> 1:03:14.680
 armbar, rear naked strangle, guillotine, et cetera, et cetera.

1:03:14.680 --> 1:03:17.440
 Just work backwards from that knowledge.

1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:20.520
 So start off learning how to defend all of those things.

1:03:20.520 --> 1:03:23.520
 You know what the major losing positions are in jiu jitsu.

1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:25.280
 Someone gets mounted on you, rear mount,

1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:26.640
 side control, knee on belly.

1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:28.800
 Those positions you can only lose from.

1:03:28.800 --> 1:03:30.280
 So work backwards from there,

1:03:30.280 --> 1:03:32.040
 getting out of those positions.

1:03:32.040 --> 1:03:33.800
 And that's how I always start.

1:03:33.800 --> 1:03:35.480
 I always say with my students,

1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:40.240
 I teach beginners from the ground up

1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:43.120
 and I teach experts backwards.

1:03:44.080 --> 1:03:45.240
 What does that mean?

1:03:45.240 --> 1:03:48.080
 When a young student comes to me with no skills,

1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:49.480
 they learn from the ground up.

1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:52.280
 They start on their backs, defending pins.

1:03:52.280 --> 1:03:54.480
 Then they start on their backs working

1:03:54.480 --> 1:03:55.720
 from half guard bottom,

1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:58.440
 then on their backs working from variations of guard.

1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:00.320
 They don't even get to see top position

1:04:00.320 --> 1:04:02.760
 until they're strong off their backs.

1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:06.400
 Then they go onto their knees and they start passing,

1:04:07.640 --> 1:04:09.520
 start standing and passing.

1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:12.120
 And then they work their pins and transitions.

1:04:12.120 --> 1:04:14.120
 And then ultimately they stand up to their feet

1:04:14.120 --> 1:04:16.600
 and they work standing position on their feet.

1:04:16.600 --> 1:04:20.680
 So they work from ground back on the floor

1:04:20.680 --> 1:04:22.560
 to ground knees on the floor,

1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:24.560
 ground standing and then both athletes standing.

1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:26.200
 It's a gradual progression over time

1:04:26.200 --> 1:04:28.840
 where they work from the bottom to the top.

1:04:28.840 --> 1:04:32.760
 With regards to experts, I teach them end game first.

1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:34.320
 They must become very, very strong

1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:37.440
 in what finishes the match, which is submission holds.

1:04:37.440 --> 1:04:42.440
 Okay, in chess, we always talk about end game.

1:04:42.960 --> 1:04:44.600
 I do the same thing in Jiu Jitsu.

1:04:44.600 --> 1:04:48.360
 I start experts just looking at the mechanics

1:04:48.360 --> 1:04:51.280
 of breaking people and all the submission holds that I teach.

1:04:51.280 --> 1:04:53.000
 You should know that I teach only

1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:56.040
 a very small number of submission holds, around six.

1:04:57.960 --> 1:05:00.760
 It's interesting that my students have by far and away

1:05:00.760 --> 1:05:03.640
 the highest submission rate in contemporary Jiu Jitsu,

1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:06.680
 but they only learn around six to seven submission holds.

1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:11.680
 I start them with mechanics where they learn the end game,

1:05:13.960 --> 1:05:15.200
 how to break someone.

1:05:19.880 --> 1:05:24.600
 Once they develop in their mind,

1:05:24.600 --> 1:05:29.600
 the belief that if, the conditional if,

1:05:29.600 --> 1:05:32.040
 they can get to one of those six positions,

1:05:32.040 --> 1:05:36.520
 there's a very high likelihood they'll win.

1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:42.520
 If they truly believe then, when it's competition time,

1:05:42.560 --> 1:05:46.200
 they'll fucking find a way to get to those positions.

1:05:46.200 --> 1:05:47.800
 That's confidence.

1:05:47.800 --> 1:05:50.360
 But if you don't believe, let's say you believe,

1:05:50.360 --> 1:05:52.000
 man, if I get to a finishing position,

1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:53.960
 an armbar or a strangle,

1:05:53.960 --> 1:05:56.160
 there's only like a 20% chance I'll finish with it.

1:05:56.160 --> 1:05:58.800
 How hard are you gonna fight to get to that position?

1:05:58.800 --> 1:06:00.080
 You're not.

1:06:00.080 --> 1:06:02.240
 Why, why would you?

1:06:02.240 --> 1:06:04.920
 But if you believe there's a 98% chance,

1:06:05.920 --> 1:06:08.160
 if you get to that position, you'll finish.

1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:09.760
 You'll find a way to get there.

1:06:10.760 --> 1:06:12.080
 That is so powerful.

1:06:12.080 --> 1:06:13.480
 There's certain things,

1:06:13.480 --> 1:06:15.160
 it may be going back to Judo a little bit,

1:06:15.160 --> 1:06:20.160
 is there's a clock choke for people who are listening.

1:06:20.280 --> 1:06:25.280
 It's with the gi when a person is in a turtle position,

1:06:25.440 --> 1:06:27.320
 in a crouching position.

1:06:27.320 --> 1:06:30.240
 And this is something that's done in Judo quite a bit.

1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:32.520
 But I have, it doesn't matter what the technique is,

1:06:32.520 --> 1:06:35.240
 I have a belief in my head

1:06:35.240 --> 1:06:37.560
 that there's not a person in the world

1:06:37.560 --> 1:06:40.440
 that I can't choke with that clock choke.

1:06:40.440 --> 1:06:41.560
 That's a good belief to have.

1:06:41.560 --> 1:06:43.480
 And I've done that.

1:06:43.480 --> 1:06:47.920
 And that it was, it built on itself.

1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:52.280
 The belief made the technique better and better and better.

1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:54.160
 Now you're onto something.

1:06:54.160 --> 1:06:56.720
 That's exactly the mindset that I'm trying to coach.

1:06:56.720 --> 1:06:57.920
 But that's step one.

1:06:59.360 --> 1:07:01.200
 You have to believe that once you get there.

1:07:01.200 --> 1:07:02.680
 But you gotta start somewhere.

1:07:02.680 --> 1:07:03.840
 And then it's step one.

1:07:03.840 --> 1:07:05.040
 But then you have to create a system

1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:06.920
 how to get there. But it's a damn important step.

1:07:06.920 --> 1:07:08.960
 So you coach the end game first,

1:07:08.960 --> 1:07:11.640
 and then you fill in the details afterwards.

1:07:11.640 --> 1:07:13.280
 Yeah, that's a huge confidence builder.

1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:17.920
 But I just, I have to say, to admit,

1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:19.920
 and it makes me sad, but I think I'm not alone.

1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:23.080
 I think a majority of Jiu Jitsu people are like this,

1:07:23.080 --> 1:07:27.880
 that I didn't do the beginner step that you talk about,

1:07:27.880 --> 1:07:30.760
 which is focusing on escapes.

1:07:30.760 --> 1:07:35.720
 I think I learned the wrong lessons from losing.

1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:39.480
 I remember in a blue belt competition long ago,

1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:44.520
 I was, I think it was, yeah,

1:07:44.520 --> 1:07:47.680
 it was the finals of Atlanta IBJJF tournament.

1:07:47.680 --> 1:07:52.680
 And there's a person that passed my guard and he took mount.

1:07:57.080 --> 1:08:01.160
 And he stayed in mount for a long time.

1:08:01.160 --> 1:08:02.760
 And I couldn't breathe.

1:08:02.760 --> 1:08:04.440
 And it was like one of those things

1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:06.440
 where I was truly dominated.

1:08:06.440 --> 1:08:09.040
 I don't think I've been dominated in Jiu Jitsu match

1:08:09.040 --> 1:08:12.560
 quite like that before or after.

1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:15.960
 And the lesson I learned from that is I'm not gonna let,

1:08:15.960 --> 1:08:20.120
 like as opposed to working on escapes,

1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:22.240
 I'm not gonna let anyone pass my guard.

1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:24.480
 What you learned is don't take risks.

1:08:24.480 --> 1:08:26.480
 Don't take risks.

1:08:26.480 --> 1:08:29.640
 Which is ultimately what kills you.

1:08:29.640 --> 1:08:31.360
 Ultimately, if you become the best you can,

1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:32.400
 you gotta take risks.

1:08:32.400 --> 1:08:34.440
 As they say, nothing risk, nothing gain.

1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:38.400
 Failure usually makes us even more risk averse

1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:39.240
 than we started.

1:08:39.240 --> 1:08:41.320
 We're already mentally biased,

1:08:41.320 --> 1:08:43.360
 being human beings in that direction.

1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:46.120
 And failure tends to reinforce that.

1:08:48.520 --> 1:08:50.240
 I work hard in my training programs

1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:52.560
 to try and correct that fault.

1:08:52.560 --> 1:08:56.240
 Is it still possible for a person who's a black belt

1:08:56.240 --> 1:08:59.000
 to then just go back to that beginning journey, I guess?

1:08:59.000 --> 1:08:59.840
 Of course.

1:09:01.080 --> 1:09:03.120
 Let me tell you something.

1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:05.720
 I'm probably gonna catch a lot of flack for saying this.

1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:06.760
 I have a belief.

1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:10.000
 I won't say something, I won't call it knowledge

1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:14.160
 because it's not known, but I have a fervent belief.

1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:19.000
 That human beings in most skill activities,

1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.920
 not all skill activities, but I will say combat sports,

1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:26.200
 for sure, can reinvent themselves in five year periods.

1:09:27.160 --> 1:09:29.200
 Now you might be saying five years?

1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:30.800
 What's magical about five years?

1:09:33.840 --> 1:09:36.320
 Mike Tyson was 13 years old

1:09:36.320 --> 1:09:38.120
 when he was taken in by custom auto.

1:09:38.120 --> 1:09:43.120
 By the age of 18, he was beating world class boxers

1:09:45.880 --> 1:09:50.880
 in the gym and had already made a strong name for himself

1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:52.600
 in international boxing.

1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:54.280
 He was already a known figure.

1:09:54.280 --> 1:09:55.320
 It was five years.

1:10:00.160 --> 1:10:05.160
 Yasuhiro Yamashita, the judo player, began judo at 13.

1:10:05.160 --> 1:10:09.160
 He placed silver in the All Japans at 17.

1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:17.040
 I could go on all day with examples of athletes

1:10:17.360 --> 1:10:22.360
 who within a five year timeframe of starting a sport

1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:25.280
 were competing at world championship level.

1:10:25.280 --> 1:10:29.080
 I'm gonna give you a rough and ready definition

1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:31.000
 of sport mastery, okay?

1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:36.000
 I believe that if you can play a competitive match

1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:41.120
 against someone ranked in the top 25 in your sport,

1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:44.480
 and it's a serious international sport,

1:10:44.480 --> 1:10:46.880
 I would call you someone who's mastered that sport.

1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:49.520
 Okay, you're damn good.

1:10:50.720 --> 1:10:54.520
 If you can go with the number 25 wrestler in the world

1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:56.720
 and give them a hard competitive match in the gym,

1:10:56.720 --> 1:10:59.560
 you may not win it, but they had a good workout,

1:10:59.560 --> 1:11:01.720
 you know, they had a good workout.

1:11:01.720 --> 1:11:05.160
 You have shown mastery of wrestling

1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:09.920
 or indeed any other combat sport you care to name.

1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:16.680
 There are numerous examples of people doing far better

1:11:16.680 --> 1:11:21.680
 than that in five years, winning medals

1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:24.040
 at world championships and even Olympic games

1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:26.240
 in that five year period.

1:11:26.240 --> 1:11:28.120
 This is not an unrealistic goal.

1:11:28.120 --> 1:11:30.120
 There is a lot of empirical evidence to show

1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:32.720
 that people have done this in the past, a lot of it.

1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:37.360
 So if you fully immerse yourself in a sport

1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:40.120
 with a well worked out, well planned training program,

1:11:40.120 --> 1:11:41.840
 there is a mountain of evidence to show

1:11:41.840 --> 1:11:43.360
 that in a five year period,

1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:47.800
 you can go from a complete beginner

1:11:47.800 --> 1:11:52.800
 to like very, very impressive skill level

1:11:53.160 --> 1:11:54.320
 to the point where you're competitive

1:11:54.320 --> 1:11:56.360
 with some of the best people on the planet.

1:11:56.360 --> 1:12:00.440
 You can reinvent yourself in these five year periods.

1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:03.000
 What happens with most people is they get to a certain level

1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.280
 and they get complacent, they get lazy

1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:07.080
 and they just keep doing the same old thing

1:12:07.080 --> 1:12:08.360
 they've been doing.

1:12:08.360 --> 1:12:11.520
 But if you're diligent and you're purposeful,

1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:14.600
 five years, you can accomplish an awful lot

1:12:14.600 --> 1:12:18.000
 and as I said, there's a mountain of evidence to show it.

1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.560
 By the way, as a small aside,

1:12:20.560 --> 1:12:22.840
 somebody who's mentioned Tversky and Yamashita

1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:24.040
 in the same conversation,

1:12:24.040 --> 1:12:27.120
 you're one of the most impressive people I've ever spoken to.

1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:29.400
 But as a small aside,

1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:33.760
 so if there's this complete beginner,

1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:35.160
 this is really interesting.

1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:39.120
 There is empirical evidence

1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:41.200
 that you can achieve incredible things

1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:42.600
 in a short amount of time.

1:12:44.800 --> 1:12:47.880
 There's a complete beginner standing before you

1:12:47.880 --> 1:12:50.480
 and that beginner has fire in their eyes

1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:53.680
 and they want to achieve mastery.

1:12:54.680 --> 1:12:58.240
 Where do you place most of the credit

1:12:58.240 --> 1:13:01.520
 for a journey that does achieve mastery?

1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:04.720
 Is it the set of ideas they have in their mind?

1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:09.360
 Is it the set of drills or the way they practice?

1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:11.600
 Is it genetics and luck?

1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:15.040
 Those are all good insights.

1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:18.040
 All of those factors you've mentioned play a definite role.

1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:21.520
 Let's start with luck, okay?

1:13:21.520 --> 1:13:24.960
 We are all subject to fortune

1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:28.600
 and fortune can be good and fortune can be bad.

1:13:28.600 --> 1:13:32.120
 Life is in many ways beautiful, but life is also tragic.

1:13:32.120 --> 1:13:36.360
 And I've had students who showed enormous promise

1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:38.720
 and just tragic events occurred in their lives.

1:13:41.280 --> 1:13:43.240
 The vicissitudes of fortune can be

1:13:44.840 --> 1:13:46.120
 a wonderful thing in your life

1:13:46.120 --> 1:13:48.760
 and they can be a terrible tragedy.

1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:53.360
 I've had students who died for various reasons

1:13:53.360 --> 1:13:56.520
 who could have gone on to become world champions.

1:13:56.520 --> 1:13:59.360
 I've had students who on a much lighter note

1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:03.120
 just fell in love and just wanted to have kids

1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:06.680
 and move away and that's a wonderful thing,

1:14:06.680 --> 1:14:08.040
 but different direction.

1:14:09.800 --> 1:14:10.960
 You just never know.

1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:13.520
 So luck does play some role.

1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:17.040
 Even things like where you're born, the location of,

1:14:17.960 --> 1:14:20.760
 your physical location in the world

1:14:20.760 --> 1:14:24.320
 or even the socioeconomic location can play a role

1:14:24.320 --> 1:14:26.800
 which could be detrimental or favorable.

1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:28.720
 So yeah, luck does play some role.

1:14:28.720 --> 1:14:31.760
 Thankfully, it's one of the smaller elements.

1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:36.320
 And I do believe that a truly resourceful mind

1:14:36.320 --> 1:14:41.040
 can overcome the majority of what fortune throws at us

1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:44.120
 and get to goals provided you're sufficiently

1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:45.160
 mentally robust.

1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:49.200
 Other things you mentioned, genetics.

1:14:51.840 --> 1:14:53.880
 I do believe in certain sports,

1:14:53.880 --> 1:14:58.480
 genetics really do play a powerful, powerful role.

1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:02.800
 For example, in any sport where power output

1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:07.720
 and reaction speed, ability to take physical damage,

1:15:07.720 --> 1:15:11.160
 then there are genetic elements which will help.

1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:15.360
 For example, I couldn't imagine a world

1:15:15.360 --> 1:15:17.440
 in which even if I have a crippled leg,

1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:22.080
 so even if I grew up in a world where my leg was normal

1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:25.200
 and I had normal legs and everything was fine with my body,

1:15:25.200 --> 1:15:30.200
 I don't believe that I could win the Olympic gold medal

1:15:30.400 --> 1:15:32.320
 in 100 meter sprinting, for example.

1:15:32.320 --> 1:15:35.640
 I just don't have enough fast twitch muscle fibers.

1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:40.640
 But the more a sport involves skill and tactics,

1:15:40.920 --> 1:15:44.840
 the less you will see genetics playing a role.

1:15:44.840 --> 1:15:49.320
 If you look at the medal podiums in jiu jitsu, for example,

1:15:49.320 --> 1:15:52.280
 you will see that no one body type

1:15:52.280 --> 1:15:54.840
 is definitively superior to another.

1:15:54.840 --> 1:15:57.360
 You will see every variation of body type

1:15:57.360 --> 1:15:59.720
 and the medal platforms in jiu jitsu.

1:16:01.040 --> 1:16:03.960
 As skill and tactics become more and more important

1:16:03.960 --> 1:16:06.200
 and things like just power output over time

1:16:06.200 --> 1:16:08.040
 become less and less important,

1:16:08.040 --> 1:16:11.640
 then you will see that genetics play

1:16:11.640 --> 1:16:12.800
 less and less of a role.

1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:15.520
 I'm happy to say that the sport of jiu jitsu,

1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:17.160
 the evidence seems pretty clear

1:16:17.160 --> 1:16:19.040
 that there's no one dominant body type

1:16:19.040 --> 1:16:19.880
 in the sport of jiu jitsu.

1:16:19.880 --> 1:16:22.840
 Rather, there's just advantages for one type

1:16:22.840 --> 1:16:24.360
 and there's advantages for another.

1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:27.160
 You just have to learn to tailor your game to your body.

1:16:30.680 --> 1:16:32.600
 With regards to training program,

1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:36.640
 yes, I believe with all my heart and all my soul

1:16:36.640 --> 1:16:40.120
 that your training program does make a difference.

1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:41.480
 I've dedicated my life to that.

1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:43.800
 Obviously, I'm biased in this regard.

1:16:44.840 --> 1:16:47.680
 I do believe that all of the students that I taught

1:16:47.680 --> 1:16:50.080
 who became world champions would have been great athletes

1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:51.760
 whether or not they had met me or not.

1:16:51.760 --> 1:16:53.000
 I believe that.

1:16:53.880 --> 1:16:56.920
 But I do also believe it would have taken them a lot longer

1:16:56.920 --> 1:17:00.000
 and they may not have gotten to the level that they did.

1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:01.800
 I'm sure they would have been impressive,

1:17:01.800 --> 1:17:06.040
 but I do believe that the nature of a training program

1:17:06.040 --> 1:17:08.200
 plays an enormous difference.

1:17:08.200 --> 1:17:10.880
 I don't mean to say this in an arrogant way.

1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:13.280
 I believe that there's, again,

1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:15.640
 a mountain of evidence to suggest this is true

1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:17.840
 because you see it in many different sports.

1:17:17.840 --> 1:17:21.680
 Let's talk, for example, about your country, Russia,

1:17:21.680 --> 1:17:23.040
 and its wrestling program.

1:17:25.760 --> 1:17:28.680
 Russia is an enormous country,

1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:32.840
 but the location where Russia's wrestling program comes from

1:17:32.840 --> 1:17:34.120
 is actually very small

1:17:34.120 --> 1:17:36.800
 and the population is actually very small.

1:17:36.800 --> 1:17:39.760
 I can't verify this, but I was told once,

1:17:39.760 --> 1:17:41.720
 I can't verify this, but the number of people

1:17:41.720 --> 1:17:44.920
 who wrestle in Russia is actually significantly smaller

1:17:44.920 --> 1:17:47.800
 than the number of people who wrestle in the United States.

1:17:47.800 --> 1:17:51.480
 It's also not part of the school athletics

1:17:51.480 --> 1:17:52.880
 and it is in the United States.

1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:54.600
 Yes, that's a different point.

1:17:54.600 --> 1:17:55.800
 We'll come back right to that

1:17:55.800 --> 1:17:57.720
 because that's also an important point.

1:17:57.720 --> 1:18:00.280
 But if you look at the actual numbers of people there,

1:18:00.280 --> 1:18:02.040
 they're actually pretty small.

1:18:02.040 --> 1:18:04.640
 So ostensibly, if it comes down to a numbers game,

1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:06.360
 America should dominate at the Olympics

1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:07.800
 because we have more wrestlers.

1:18:07.800 --> 1:18:09.840
 Now, the story gets more complicated

1:18:09.840 --> 1:18:12.240
 because America has a different style of wrestling,

1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:14.440
 the collegiate style than the international freestyle.

1:18:14.440 --> 1:18:16.280
 That is a complicating factor.

1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:21.760
 But nonetheless, what you see there

1:18:21.760 --> 1:18:24.240
 is that numbers aren't everything.

1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:27.680
 Rather, the manner in which people are trained

1:18:27.680 --> 1:18:29.480
 clearly has an impact.

1:18:29.480 --> 1:18:32.800
 And we know very little about the,

1:18:32.800 --> 1:18:34.560
 there's very little reliable information

1:18:34.560 --> 1:18:36.360
 about the training program for wrestling

1:18:36.360 --> 1:18:39.320
 in the Russian States.

1:18:39.320 --> 1:18:43.120
 But one thing is incontestable is the amount of success

1:18:43.120 --> 1:18:45.920
 that they've had in international world championship

1:18:45.920 --> 1:18:47.560
 and Olympic competition.

1:18:48.600 --> 1:18:52.160
 They are disproportionately successful

1:18:52.160 --> 1:18:54.760
 despite their relatively small numbers.

1:18:54.760 --> 1:18:57.920
 There's nothing genetically special about them.

1:18:57.920 --> 1:19:01.120
 You can talk about performance enhancing drugs,

1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:03.440
 but those are a worldwide phenomenon.

1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:05.080
 They don't have any access to technology

1:19:05.080 --> 1:19:07.040
 that the rest of the world doesn't have.

1:19:10.080 --> 1:19:11.880
 At some point, you gotta start asking,

1:19:11.880 --> 1:19:14.440
 what are they doing differently in the training room?

1:19:14.440 --> 1:19:19.440
 And there are many other examples of similar situations.

1:19:19.440 --> 1:19:24.440
 My country, New Zealand, has an insanely successful

1:19:26.240 --> 1:19:28.920
 rugby program, the sport of rugby,

1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:33.920
 which they have dominated for literally generations

1:19:34.120 --> 1:19:38.040
 despite the fact that our population is very, very small

1:19:38.040 --> 1:19:39.240
 compared with the rest of the country.

1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:41.760
 And we don't excel in many other sports.

1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:45.280
 New Zealand does fairly well in sports overall,

1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:47.320
 but nothing like they do in rugby.

1:19:47.320 --> 1:19:50.320
 And you've got to ask yourself, is there a culture there

1:19:50.320 --> 1:19:52.160
 which built this up?

1:19:52.160 --> 1:19:57.160
 And the world is full of examples of seemingly small

1:19:57.160 --> 1:19:59.960
 and unpromising areas or locations

1:19:59.960 --> 1:20:02.800
 putting out disproportionately high numbers

1:20:02.800 --> 1:20:05.120
 of successful athletes.

1:20:05.120 --> 1:20:10.120
 And that points to the idea that different training programs

1:20:10.280 --> 1:20:12.320
 have different success rates.

1:20:12.320 --> 1:20:15.720
 And so I truly believe with all my heart and all my soul

1:20:15.720 --> 1:20:20.360
 that how you train does make a significant difference.

1:20:20.360 --> 1:20:21.680
 I would even go further and say

1:20:21.680 --> 1:20:23.120
 it makes the most difference.

1:20:23.120 --> 1:20:24.240
 Is it the only thing?

1:20:24.240 --> 1:20:25.080
 Absolutely not.

1:20:25.080 --> 1:20:26.360
 We've already talked about fortune.

1:20:26.360 --> 1:20:27.760
 We've talked about genetics.

1:20:29.080 --> 1:20:30.880
 If you wanna get nasty, you can even talk about things

1:20:30.880 --> 1:20:32.080
 like performance enhancing drugs

1:20:32.080 --> 1:20:34.280
 that obviously plays a role in modern sports.

1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:41.360
 But I do believe that the majority of what creates success

1:20:41.360 --> 1:20:43.560
 is the interaction between the athlete

1:20:43.560 --> 1:20:45.280
 and the training program.

1:20:45.280 --> 1:20:47.200
 Now, the training program is one thing.

1:20:47.200 --> 1:20:49.240
 I do believe that's the single most important,

1:20:49.240 --> 1:20:52.040
 but right behind it is the athlete themselves.

1:20:54.440 --> 1:20:57.880
 In my own experience, people talk about athletes

1:20:57.880 --> 1:20:59.040
 that I've trained successfully,

1:20:59.040 --> 1:21:00.360
 but they never talk about athletes

1:21:00.360 --> 1:21:01.920
 that I've trained unsuccessfully.

1:21:03.240 --> 1:21:06.360
 Always remember that for every champion coach produces,

1:21:06.360 --> 1:21:08.080
 there's always going to be a difference.

1:21:08.080 --> 1:21:11.360
 Always remember that for every champion a coach produces,

1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:14.320
 there's a hundred people that they coach

1:21:14.320 --> 1:21:18.840
 that no one ever heard of, and this is completely normal.

1:21:20.160 --> 1:21:24.000
 A coach can never take the lion's share of the credit.

1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:27.600
 A coach creates possibilities,

1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:31.360
 but it's the athlete who actualizes the possibilities.

1:21:31.360 --> 1:21:35.880
 And so building that rapport and finding the right people

1:21:35.880 --> 1:21:39.360
 to excel in your training program is also a big part of it.

1:21:39.360 --> 1:21:42.280
 What makes the difference between the successful,

1:21:42.280 --> 1:21:45.920
 your successes and your failures as a coach?

1:21:45.920 --> 1:21:47.000
 A range of reasons.

1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:50.760
 The single most important is persistence.

1:21:52.280 --> 1:21:55.320
 People will point to all kinds of virtues amongst athletes.

1:21:55.320 --> 1:21:56.520
 This guy's the most courageous.

1:21:56.520 --> 1:21:58.200
 This guy's the strongest.

1:21:58.200 --> 1:21:59.960
 These are all virtues,

1:21:59.960 --> 1:22:04.960
 but the one indispensable virtue is persistence,

1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:07.440
 the ability just to stay in the game long enough

1:22:07.440 --> 1:22:09.360
 to get the results you seek.

1:22:09.360 --> 1:22:12.640
 But what does persistence really look like?

1:22:12.640 --> 1:22:14.400
 If we can just break that apart a little bit.

1:22:14.400 --> 1:22:17.000
 It's actually, this is a great question you're asking

1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:18.680
 because most people see it

1:22:18.680 --> 1:22:22.000
 as a kind of simplistic doggedness

1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:23.720
 where you just show up every day.

1:22:23.720 --> 1:22:24.760
 That's not it.

1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:27.720
 The most important form of persistence

1:22:27.720 --> 1:22:30.440
 is persistence of thinking,

1:22:30.440 --> 1:22:34.640
 which looks to push you in increasingly efficient,

1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:37.160
 more and more efficient methods of training.

1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:40.200
 Famously, people talk about the idea

1:22:40.200 --> 1:22:42.680
 that the hardest work of all is hard thinking,

1:22:42.680 --> 1:22:44.440
 and they're absolutely right.

1:22:44.440 --> 1:22:45.640
 Okay, coming into the gym

1:22:45.640 --> 1:22:48.320
 and just doing the same thing for a decade

1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:50.240
 isn't going to make you better.

1:22:50.240 --> 1:22:51.720
 What's going to make you better

1:22:51.720 --> 1:22:53.800
 is progressive training over time

1:22:53.800 --> 1:22:56.320
 where you identify clear goals marked out

1:22:56.320 --> 1:22:58.880
 in time increments, three months, six months,

1:22:58.880 --> 1:23:00.240
 12 months, five years,

1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:03.640
 and build those short term goals

1:23:03.640 --> 1:23:05.920
 into a program of long term goals,

1:23:07.560 --> 1:23:10.240
 making sure that the training program changes over time

1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:11.920
 so that as your skill level rises,

1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:13.600
 the challenges you face in the gym

1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:15.160
 become higher and higher.

1:23:15.160 --> 1:23:16.440
 Don't kill them at the start

1:23:16.440 --> 1:23:18.680
 with challenges that are too hard for them

1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:20.880
 to deal with, they get discouraged and leave.

1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:22.720
 Build them slowly over time,

1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:25.240
 but make sure they don't just get left in a swamp

1:23:25.240 --> 1:23:26.480
 where they're just doing the same thing

1:23:26.480 --> 1:23:28.240
 they were doing three years ago and they get bored.

1:23:28.240 --> 1:23:31.320
 And there's two ways you can leave in a gym.

1:23:31.320 --> 1:23:35.240
 You can leave from adversity, it was too tough,

1:23:35.240 --> 1:23:37.400
 or you can leave from boredom.

1:23:37.400 --> 1:23:40.120
 Everyone talks about the first,

1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:41.800
 no one talks about the second.

1:23:42.680 --> 1:23:45.360
 Most people, when they get to black belt,

1:23:45.360 --> 1:23:46.800
 they get bored.

1:23:46.800 --> 1:23:47.960
 They know what their game is,

1:23:47.960 --> 1:23:48.960
 they know what they're good at,

1:23:48.960 --> 1:23:50.560
 they know what they're not good at.

1:23:50.560 --> 1:23:52.720
 When they compete, they stick with what they're good at,

1:23:52.720 --> 1:23:54.680
 and they avoid what they're not good at,

1:23:54.680 --> 1:23:56.160
 and they get bored.

1:23:56.160 --> 1:23:59.440
 They reach a plateau, and that's it.

1:23:59.440 --> 1:24:02.360
 My whole thing is to make sure it's not so tough

1:24:02.360 --> 1:24:05.160
 at the start that they leave because of adversity,

1:24:05.160 --> 1:24:06.400
 and then for the rest of their career

1:24:06.400 --> 1:24:07.680
 to make sure it's not boring

1:24:07.680 --> 1:24:10.080
 so they leave because of boredom.

1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:11.680
 Travis Stevens actually said something

1:24:11.680 --> 1:24:13.800
 that changed the way I see training.

1:24:13.800 --> 1:24:15.520
 He said it as a side comment,

1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:19.920
 but he said that at the end of a good training session,

1:24:19.920 --> 1:24:22.440
 your mind should be exhausted, not your body.

1:24:22.440 --> 1:24:27.440
 And I've, for most of my life,

1:24:27.880 --> 1:24:31.280
 saw good training sessions where my body was exhausted.

1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:35.120
 Yes, I believe that's the case with most people.

1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:37.080
 You should come out of the training session

1:24:37.080 --> 1:24:39.240
 with your mind buzzing with ideas,

1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:41.480
 like possibilities for tomorrow.

1:24:41.480 --> 1:24:42.880
 And by the way, on that note,

1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:45.440
 I would go further and say that the training session

1:24:45.440 --> 1:24:48.640
 doesn't finish when your body stops moving.

1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:51.160
 It finishes when your mind stops moving,

1:24:51.160 --> 1:24:53.160
 and your mind shouldn't stop moving.

1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:55.080
 After that session, there should be analysis.

1:24:55.080 --> 1:24:55.920
 What did I do well?

1:24:55.920 --> 1:24:57.240
 What did I do badly?

1:24:57.240 --> 1:25:00.200
 How could I do better with the things that I did well?

1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:03.600
 Can I ask you about something that I truly enjoy

1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:05.640
 and I think is really powerful,

1:25:05.640 --> 1:25:07.600
 but most people don't seem to believe in that,

1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:08.680
 but is drilling?

1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:11.520
 I don't know.

1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:15.360
 Maybe people are different, but I love the idea,

1:25:15.360 --> 1:25:16.840
 maybe even outside of jiu jitsu,

1:25:16.840 --> 1:25:19.400
 of doing the same thing over and over.

1:25:19.400 --> 1:25:21.680
 It's like Jiro dreams of sushi.

1:25:21.680 --> 1:25:26.680
 I love doing the thing that nobody wants to do

1:25:27.800 --> 1:25:30.680
 and doing it 10 times, 100 times, 1,000 times

1:25:30.680 --> 1:25:32.840
 more than what nobody wants to do.

1:25:34.200 --> 1:25:36.840
 So I'm a huge fan of drilling.

1:25:36.840 --> 1:25:38.680
 Obviously, I'm not a professional athlete,

1:25:38.680 --> 1:25:41.160
 but I feel like if I actually gave myself,

1:25:42.360 --> 1:25:44.400
 if I wanted to be really good at jiu jitsu,

1:25:44.400 --> 1:25:47.480
 like reach the level of being in the top 25

1:25:47.480 --> 1:25:50.280
 when I was much younger, like really strive,

1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:55.800
 I think I could achieve it by drilling.

1:25:56.840 --> 1:25:59.080
 I had this belief untested.

1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:03.280
 Can you challenge this idea or agree with it?

1:26:03.280 --> 1:26:05.360
 First off, fascinating.

1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:08.000
 However, we're going to have to disagree.

1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:08.840
 No, no.

1:26:09.880 --> 1:26:13.240
 We're just gonna have to start to understand

1:26:13.240 --> 1:26:15.560
 what are we talking about when we talk about drilling?

1:26:15.560 --> 1:26:17.600
 It's a very vague term.

1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:22.600
 Okay, at this moment, many of your listeners

1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:25.000
 are probably having the same thought process,

1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:26.200
 which is, oh, drilling.

1:26:26.200 --> 1:26:27.880
 Yeah, I know what that is.

1:26:27.880 --> 1:26:30.600
 We go into the gym and we pick a move

1:26:30.600 --> 1:26:33.360
 and we practice it for a certain number of repetitions.

1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:38.240
 And if I do that, I'm gonna get better at the technique.

1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:43.240
 Okay, they're wrong.

1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:51.240
 We've got to have a much more in depth understanding

1:26:53.240 --> 1:26:54.760
 of what the hell we're talking about

1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:56.200
 when we talk about drilling.

1:26:57.480 --> 1:27:02.480
 Ultimately, any movement in the gym

1:27:02.480 --> 1:27:07.480
 that doesn't improve the skills you already have

1:27:07.520 --> 1:27:10.520
 or build new skills is a waste of time,

1:27:11.920 --> 1:27:13.160
 a waste of resources.

1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:16.120
 Everything you do should be done with the aim

1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:18.960
 and the understanding that this is gonna make me better

1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:20.600
 at the sport I practice.

1:27:20.600 --> 1:27:22.360
 If it's not, shouldn't be there.

1:27:24.160 --> 1:27:27.320
 The majority of what passes for drilling

1:27:27.320 --> 1:27:32.640
 in most training halls will not make you better,

1:27:32.640 --> 1:27:35.920
 including some of the most cherished forms of drilling,

1:27:37.280 --> 1:27:40.000
 which is repetition for numbers.

1:27:41.080 --> 1:27:42.440
 The moment you say to someone,

1:27:42.440 --> 1:27:44.440
 I want you to do this a hundred times,

1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:47.920
 what are they really thinking about?

1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:48.760
 Volume.

1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.240
 They're saying, okay, I'm at repetition 78.

1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:55.400
 I'm at 80, 20 more to go.

1:27:55.400 --> 1:27:58.720
 All they're talking, their primary thought process

1:27:58.720 --> 1:27:59.680
 is on numbers.

1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:03.240
 That's not the point of drilling.

1:28:03.240 --> 1:28:05.160
 The point is skill acquisition.

1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:09.680
 When people drill, don't get them focused on numbers,

1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:12.440
 get them focused on mechanics.

1:28:12.440 --> 1:28:14.240
 That's what they have to worry about.

1:28:14.240 --> 1:28:17.800
 I never have my students drill for numbers ever.

1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:20.320
 Just one, two, three, get the fuck out of here.

1:28:20.320 --> 1:28:21.880
 Are you kidding me?

1:28:21.880 --> 1:28:23.600
 Like how are you gonna get better with that?

1:28:23.600 --> 1:28:28.200
 Okay, get them working on the sense of gaining knowledge.

1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:30.080
 That's my job.

1:28:30.080 --> 1:28:31.640
 I have to give them knowledge.

1:28:31.640 --> 1:28:34.160
 I have to explain to them what they're trying to do.

1:28:34.160 --> 1:28:36.840
 That starts them on the right track.

1:28:36.840 --> 1:28:38.960
 But knowledge is one thing.

1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:41.280
 Skill is another.

1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:44.000
 If jiu jitsu was just about knowledge,

1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:48.000
 then all the 60 and 70 year old red belts

1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:49.200
 would be the world champions.

1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:50.480
 They're not.

1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:53.840
 Jiu jitsu isn't won by knowledge, it's won by skill.

1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:58.160
 Knowledge is the first step in building skill.

1:28:58.160 --> 1:29:01.960
 So my job as a coach is to transmit knowledge.

1:29:01.960 --> 1:29:04.680
 Then I have to create training programs

1:29:04.680 --> 1:29:08.440
 with a path from knowledge to polished skill

1:29:09.720 --> 1:29:11.240
 is carried out.

1:29:11.240 --> 1:29:13.760
 That's the interface between me and my students.

1:29:13.760 --> 1:29:18.760
 And so I give them drills where the whole emphasis

1:29:18.760 --> 1:29:23.680
 is upon getting a sense where they understand

1:29:23.680 --> 1:29:26.520
 what are the problems they're trying to solve

1:29:26.520 --> 1:29:30.520
 and working towards practical solutions.

1:29:30.520 --> 1:29:32.760
 They never work with numbers.

1:29:32.760 --> 1:29:36.040
 They work with mechanics and feel.

1:29:36.040 --> 1:29:39.200
 Then you have to bring in the idea of progression.

1:29:41.480 --> 1:29:44.800
 When you drill, there's zero resistance.

1:29:44.800 --> 1:29:48.920
 When you fight in competition, there's 100% resistance.

1:29:48.920 --> 1:29:51.240
 You can't go from zero to 100.

1:29:52.640 --> 1:29:54.960
 There has to be progress over time

1:29:55.880 --> 1:29:59.160
 where I have them work in drills

1:29:59.160 --> 1:30:04.160
 with slightly increasing increments of resistance.

1:30:04.200 --> 1:30:06.640
 And just as we talked about earlier with the weightlifter

1:30:06.640 --> 1:30:08.840
 who doesn't start with 500 pounds,

1:30:08.840 --> 1:30:11.960
 but who begins with the bar and then over time

1:30:11.960 --> 1:30:14.680
 builds the skills that one day out there in the future

1:30:14.680 --> 1:30:16.720
 he will lift 500 pounds.

1:30:16.720 --> 1:30:19.880
 So too, that Jujikutami that you're working on today

1:30:19.880 --> 1:30:22.720
 is feeble and pathetic, but five years from now

1:30:22.720 --> 1:30:24.680
 you'll win a world championship with it.

1:30:25.640 --> 1:30:28.600
 You can't have this naive idea of drilling.

1:30:28.600 --> 1:30:30.320
 It's something you just come out,

1:30:30.320 --> 1:30:34.760
 you randomly pick a move and you work for numbers

1:30:34.760 --> 1:30:36.720
 until you've satisfied a certain set of numbers

1:30:36.720 --> 1:30:37.720
 that your coach threw at you

1:30:37.720 --> 1:30:39.720
 and then think you're gonna get better.

1:30:39.720 --> 1:30:45.960
 There's even dangers with drilling.

1:30:45.960 --> 1:30:50.960
 There is no performance increase that comes

1:30:52.560 --> 1:30:54.440
 once you get to a certain level

1:30:54.440 --> 1:30:57.200
 and you just keep doing the same damn thing.

1:30:58.560 --> 1:31:01.640
 Let's say, for example, you come out

1:31:01.640 --> 1:31:04.880
 and you hit a hundred repetitions of the arm

1:31:04.880 --> 1:31:06.720
 by Jujikutami from guard position.

1:31:06.720 --> 1:31:07.840
 And you're all proud of yourself

1:31:07.840 --> 1:31:09.120
 because you hit a hundred repetitions

1:31:09.120 --> 1:31:11.040
 and your body's tired and you're telling yourself,

1:31:11.040 --> 1:31:12.880
 man, I got a good workout.

1:31:12.880 --> 1:31:16.320
 And you come in tomorrow, you do exactly the same thing.

1:31:16.320 --> 1:31:18.400
 You come in the day after that and a week goes by

1:31:18.400 --> 1:31:19.880
 and you've done the same thing.

1:31:20.960 --> 1:31:23.320
 Then a year later, you do the same thing.

1:31:24.520 --> 1:31:28.800
 Ask yourself, has your Jujikutami really gotten better?

1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:32.480
 No, you've performed literally thousands

1:31:32.480 --> 1:31:34.280
 and thousands of repetitions.

1:31:34.280 --> 1:31:38.280
 You've spent an enormous amount of training time

1:31:38.280 --> 1:31:40.800
 and energy that could have gone in different directions

1:31:40.800 --> 1:31:43.320
 on something which didn't make you any better.

1:31:45.560 --> 1:31:49.640
 Drills have diminishing returns.

1:31:49.640 --> 1:31:51.760
 Once you get to a certain skill level,

1:31:51.760 --> 1:31:54.800
 if you just keep hammering on the same thing

1:31:54.800 --> 1:31:58.840
 in the same fashion for the same amount of time,

1:31:58.840 --> 1:32:01.000
 you stop getting better.

1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:04.360
 Can I, partially for fun, partially for Dallas Advocate,

1:32:04.360 --> 1:32:05.840
 but partially because I actually believe this

1:32:05.840 --> 1:32:10.240
 to push back on some points, is it possible?

1:32:10.240 --> 1:32:13.800
 So everything you said, I think is beautiful and correct.

1:32:13.800 --> 1:32:18.800
 But the asking yourself the question, am I getting better?

1:32:18.800 --> 1:32:19.640
 It's a really important one

1:32:19.640 --> 1:32:21.480
 and you could do that in training.

1:32:21.480 --> 1:32:23.320
 Is there a set of techniques,

1:32:24.320 --> 1:32:26.320
 maybe a small subset of all the techniques

1:32:26.320 --> 1:32:27.920
 that are in Jiu Jitsu,

1:32:27.920 --> 1:32:32.920
 where you can have significant skill acquisition

1:32:34.120 --> 1:32:37.440
 if you put in the numbers or the time, whatever,

1:32:37.440 --> 1:32:40.680
 on a technique against an opponent who's not resisting?

1:32:41.680 --> 1:32:43.600
 Here's, let me elaborate.

1:32:43.600 --> 1:32:45.600
 What I've, in my, maybe I'm different.

1:32:45.600 --> 1:32:47.200
 You'll probably have to finish an example.

1:32:47.200 --> 1:32:48.040
 Yes.

1:32:49.680 --> 1:32:51.320
 Let me first make a general statement

1:32:51.320 --> 1:32:53.080
 and then I can give examples.

1:32:53.080 --> 1:32:56.680
 The general statement is I found that through repetitions,

1:32:56.680 --> 1:33:00.680
 and this is high repetitions combined with training,

1:33:00.680 --> 1:33:03.920
 but high repetitions against a non resisting opponent,

1:33:03.920 --> 1:33:08.920
 I've gotten to understand the way my body moves,

1:33:09.160 --> 1:33:11.600
 the way I apply pressure on a human.

1:33:11.600 --> 1:33:13.320
 Because it's not actually zero resistance.

1:33:13.320 --> 1:33:14.920
 The opponent's still laying there.

1:33:14.920 --> 1:33:16.840
 They're still keeping their legs up.

1:33:16.840 --> 1:33:19.400
 They're still doing, they might not be resisting,

1:33:19.400 --> 1:33:21.520
 but they're still creating a structure.

1:33:21.520 --> 1:33:22.360
 Yes.

1:33:22.360 --> 1:33:23.520
 A non dynamic structure.

1:33:23.520 --> 1:33:24.880
 They're presenting a target.

1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:25.720
 Yes.

1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:27.920
 But it's not dynamic.

1:33:27.920 --> 1:33:31.960
 So you can't master the timing of things,

1:33:31.960 --> 1:33:34.760
 but you can master the, not master,

1:33:34.760 --> 1:33:37.760
 but I felt like I could gain an understanding

1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:40.040
 of how to apply pressure to the human body

1:33:40.920 --> 1:33:43.160
 over thousands of repetitions.

1:33:43.160 --> 1:33:45.360
 Now, for example, I just, just to give you an example

1:33:45.360 --> 1:33:48.000
 to know what we're talking about.

1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:52.160
 There's a guy named Saulo Herbaro and Shanji Herbaro

1:33:52.160 --> 1:33:55.160
 that have this, I guess, I already forgot,

1:33:55.160 --> 1:33:57.560
 but the headquarters position or something like that.

1:33:57.560 --> 1:34:00.960
 But putting pressure as you pass guard,

1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:03.440
 like medium passing distance kind of pressure.

1:34:04.480 --> 1:34:06.960
 I've did thousands of repetitions of that

1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:11.960
 to understand what putting pressure with my hips feels like.

1:34:12.280 --> 1:34:13.920
 To truly understand that movement,

1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:17.560
 I felt like I was getting much better.

1:34:17.560 --> 1:34:19.440
 It's like, it's hard to put into words,

1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:22.680
 but that skill acquisition is so subtle.

1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:25.440
 Just the way you turn your hips.

1:34:25.440 --> 1:34:27.160
 But you're already talking about

1:34:27.160 --> 1:34:28.480
 a better form of drilling now.

1:34:28.480 --> 1:34:30.480
 You're going beyond the basic numbers

1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:32.440
 and you're getting the sense of feel and mechanics,

1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:33.960
 which is what we want in drilling.

1:34:33.960 --> 1:34:36.080
 But the reason I say numbers,

1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:37.440
 and maybe you can speak to this,

1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:39.760
 but this might be an OCD thing,

1:34:39.760 --> 1:34:43.280
 but it allows you to take a journey

1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:46.280
 that doesn't just last a week or two weeks,

1:34:46.280 --> 1:34:48.960
 but a journey where you stay with the technique

1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:50.640
 for two, three years.

1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:53.760
 And there's a dedication to it.

1:34:53.760 --> 1:34:57.040
 Where it's a long term commitment

1:34:57.040 --> 1:34:59.000
 to where you're forcing yourself,

1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:00.400
 perhaps there's other mechanisms,

1:35:00.400 --> 1:35:03.280
 but you're forcing yourself to stay with a technique

1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:05.000
 longer than most people around you

1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:07.120
 are staying with whatever they're working on.

1:35:07.120 --> 1:35:09.120
 And you're taking that long journey.

1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:12.360
 And the numbers somehow enforce that persistence

1:35:12.360 --> 1:35:13.480
 and that dedication.

1:35:14.880 --> 1:35:18.320
 First thing, that journey's a wonderful thing.

1:35:18.320 --> 1:35:23.000
 And if that technique is a crucial part of what you do,

1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:24.760
 then it's time well invested.

1:35:24.760 --> 1:35:25.600
 But always understand

1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:27.560
 that it comes at an opportunity cost.

1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:30.400
 That by spending that amount of time on that one technique,

1:35:30.400 --> 1:35:31.720
 you've sacrificed other things

1:35:31.720 --> 1:35:35.000
 that you could have learned that could have won you matches.

1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:40.000
 So understand that every focus upon one element of the game

1:35:40.080 --> 1:35:43.240
 comes at the opportunity cost of other elements.

1:35:43.240 --> 1:35:46.640
 Now, as long as you're playing a part of the game

1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:48.720
 where, okay, this is central to what I do.

1:35:48.720 --> 1:35:50.760
 Yes, okay, that's fine.

1:35:50.760 --> 1:35:53.720
 But just be aware of the danger of opportunity cost.

1:35:53.720 --> 1:35:55.480
 That's something no one talks about in the training room,

1:35:55.480 --> 1:35:57.560
 but it becomes very important.

1:35:57.560 --> 1:35:59.080
 Secondly, the other question you have to start

1:35:59.080 --> 1:36:01.320
 asking yourself is, okay,

1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:05.880
 that training clearly had benefits for you early on.

1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:08.640
 But when the point of diminishing return starts coming

1:36:08.640 --> 1:36:11.120
 and if you feel you're just doing the same thing,

1:36:11.120 --> 1:36:12.320
 then it's time to switch.

1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:15.360
 Now, if you feel you're still getting benefit from it,

1:36:15.360 --> 1:36:17.320
 by all means, continue.

1:36:17.320 --> 1:36:18.960
 That will be a call on your part.

1:36:18.960 --> 1:36:21.560
 You've been playing this game a long time now,

1:36:21.560 --> 1:36:23.320
 so I would trust your call on that.

1:36:25.400 --> 1:36:28.600
 But my job as a coach is to look out and say,

1:36:28.600 --> 1:36:30.240
 okay, this kid's been working

1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:34.600
 cross Ashigarami for six months

1:36:34.600 --> 1:36:37.240
 and I feel he's gotten to a good skill level.

1:36:37.240 --> 1:36:40.080
 If he stays any further on it,

1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:43.000
 the opportunity cost becomes greater

1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:45.840
 than the expected benefits of continuing it.

1:36:45.840 --> 1:36:47.040
 And that's my job as a coach,

1:36:47.040 --> 1:36:48.520
 is to direct things in that fashion.

1:36:48.520 --> 1:36:50.320
 If I can do a good job with that,

1:36:50.320 --> 1:36:52.760
 then I can take them to the next level of drilling

1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:54.360
 and start amping it up.

1:36:54.360 --> 1:36:56.760
 And that's how I keep progress over time.

1:36:56.760 --> 1:36:59.880
 My biggest fear is to have students

1:37:00.880 --> 1:37:03.560
 run past the point of diminishing returns,

1:37:03.560 --> 1:37:07.920
 staying stagnant where opportunity costs comes in

1:37:07.920 --> 1:37:10.600
 and they're not making the progress they could

1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:13.240
 in the time that they've been working.

1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:14.080
 I mean, that was,

1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:16.320
 it was almost a philosophical question for me.

1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:18.080
 That's what I was always on a search on

1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:22.520
 because I know my mind is likes drilling.

1:37:22.520 --> 1:37:26.560
 I don't like relying on other people for improvement

1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:30.640
 and drilling allows me to do something

1:37:30.640 --> 1:37:33.680
 that is 100% me.

1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:34.520
 It's interesting Lex,

1:37:34.520 --> 1:37:36.320
 you say you don't like relying on other people in drilling,

1:37:36.320 --> 1:37:39.280
 but in drilling, you really do rely a lot on your partner.

1:37:39.280 --> 1:37:40.960
 One of the first things I do when I coach people

1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:43.280
 is I teach them how to drill.

1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:44.920
 That's a skill in itself.

1:37:44.920 --> 1:37:49.520
 And drilling is in a sense,

1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:53.280
 the opposite of sparring.

1:37:53.280 --> 1:37:55.800
 Drilling is a cooperative venture

1:37:55.800 --> 1:37:58.480
 where you work as dance partners,

1:37:58.480 --> 1:38:00.280
 complimenting each other's movement.

1:38:01.240 --> 1:38:04.280
 If I drill with Gordon Ryan and I want him to work on bars,

1:38:04.280 --> 1:38:05.920
 I will move my body in ways

1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:09.560
 which make it an interesting exercise for Gordon.

1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:15.560
 I'm not just sitting there and he does a repetition

1:38:15.560 --> 1:38:17.720
 and I'm, okay, he does 10.

1:38:18.760 --> 1:38:20.880
 I can't wait for this to be over so I can do my 10

1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:22.240
 and I can't wait for all this to be over

1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:25.600
 so we can just spar and get over all this bullshit.

1:38:25.600 --> 1:38:28.480
 That's the sad truth of most drilling in Jiu Jitsu.

1:38:30.960 --> 1:38:33.360
 There's a sense in which when good people drill,

1:38:33.360 --> 1:38:36.920
 it's like watching good people dance.

1:38:36.920 --> 1:38:39.800
 They move in unison and compliment each other's movement

1:38:39.800 --> 1:38:42.200
 and make each other look better.

1:38:42.200 --> 1:38:44.480
 Sparring, on the other hand, is the exact opposite of that.

1:38:44.480 --> 1:38:46.160
 That's resistance where you're trying to make

1:38:46.160 --> 1:38:48.320
 the other person look as bad as possible.

1:38:48.320 --> 1:38:51.080
 And once you understand the different directions

1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:52.800
 in which drilling and sparring go,

1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:54.360
 that's when things start getting interesting.

1:38:54.360 --> 1:38:56.560
 You start getting fast progress.

1:38:56.560 --> 1:38:59.000
 Yeah, you're absolutely right.

1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:02.240
 I think I was not very eloquent describing what I mean.

1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:07.240
 I found myself not able to find in Jiu Jitsu

1:39:07.280 --> 1:39:09.920
 too many people that are willing to dedicate

1:39:09.920 --> 1:39:12.920
 a huge amount of time to a particular technique.

1:39:12.920 --> 1:39:15.000
 I concur with you on Netflix.

1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:17.160
 Now, answer the interesting question, why?

1:39:18.920 --> 1:39:21.920
 Why can't you get people to drill with you?

1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:24.160
 By the way, if I could just shout out

1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:25.720
 the people that did drill with me

1:39:25.720 --> 1:39:30.720
 is usually blue belt women because they're smaller,

1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:34.520
 they don't like training because they get their ass kicked

1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:36.080
 because they're much smaller.

1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:40.960
 So they're willing to invest a significant amount of effort

1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:44.160
 into training.

1:39:44.160 --> 1:39:49.080
 That's good, but their motivation for doing so is not good.

1:39:49.080 --> 1:39:49.920
 Well, yes.

1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:51.480
 But your motivation for drilling is

1:39:51.480 --> 1:39:52.640
 because you don't want to get your ass kicked.

1:39:52.640 --> 1:39:55.400
 That's not a good motivation. No black belt ever.

1:39:55.400 --> 1:39:57.040
 I could never find a black belt

1:39:57.040 --> 1:39:59.400
 that I could drill with like this.

1:39:59.400 --> 1:40:01.520
 Now let's go back to that question, why?

1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:05.080
 I don't mean this, I am somebody

1:40:05.080 --> 1:40:06.920
 who likes to say nice things about people.

1:40:06.920 --> 1:40:08.920
 So let me answer for you.

1:40:08.920 --> 1:40:09.800
 Yeah.

1:40:09.800 --> 1:40:12.520
 Two reasons, because they find it boring.

1:40:12.520 --> 1:40:13.360
 Yes.

1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:14.880
 And secondly, perhaps more importantly,

1:40:14.880 --> 1:40:16.520
 they don't believe it works.

1:40:16.520 --> 1:40:18.320
 Yeah, those are good answers.

1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:20.080
 And now let's go further

1:40:20.080 --> 1:40:22.640
 and ask the truly interesting question.

1:40:22.640 --> 1:40:23.920
 Why do they believe that?

1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:28.920
 If I were to answer it in the context of Russian wrestling,

1:40:29.640 --> 1:40:32.480
 where drilling is much bigger part,

1:40:32.480 --> 1:40:35.560
 is I think culturally that was knowledge

1:40:35.560 --> 1:40:38.200
 that everybody tells each other in Jiu Jitsu

1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:43.200
 that drilling doesn't work.

1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:47.520
 Because they never taught how to drill.

1:40:47.520 --> 1:40:49.040
 No one ever sits you down one day and says,

1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:50.760
 okay, this is how you drill.

1:40:50.760 --> 1:40:54.240
 And so the exercise feels futile.

1:40:54.240 --> 1:40:55.840
 They don't feel their skill level is going up.

1:40:55.840 --> 1:40:59.000
 They don't associate drilling with increased skill level.

1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:01.680
 They associate sparring with increased skill level,

1:41:01.680 --> 1:41:03.760
 but not drilling, which is a tragedy

1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:08.000
 because it is a fantastic way to introduce

1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:11.360
 and expand the repertoire of a developing student.

1:41:11.360 --> 1:41:13.760
 It's an essential part of every workout I teach.

1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:17.760
 I always say the game of Jiu Jitsu begins with knowledge

1:41:17.760 --> 1:41:20.400
 and builds up to skill.

1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:23.120
 Who wins is the one who has greater skill

1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:24.880
 and nine times out of 10.

1:41:25.920 --> 1:41:28.960
 So to me, it's a tragedy that what you're saying

1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:31.200
 breaks my heart to hear that you couldn't get a black belt

1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:33.400
 to drill with you, that's shameful.

1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:38.280
 But I understand, I sympathize with those black belts too

1:41:38.280 --> 1:41:41.640
 because the way in which most people are told to drill

1:41:41.640 --> 1:41:44.920
 does feel ineffective and it is damn boring.

1:41:44.920 --> 1:41:46.400
 They'd rather just spar.

1:41:46.400 --> 1:41:48.480
 They feel like they get more out of the workout.

1:41:48.480 --> 1:41:51.760
 And that's, if anything, an indictment

1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:54.640
 upon most of the training programs around the nation.

1:41:54.640 --> 1:41:56.840
 Would you say that drilling,

1:41:56.840 --> 1:42:01.520
 if you were to build a black belt world champion,

1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:05.760
 would drilling be, what percent of their training,

1:42:05.760 --> 1:42:08.480
 in the entirety of their career would be drilling?

1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:09.480
 Great question.

1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:11.840
 Let's first put a proviso on it

1:42:11.840 --> 1:42:14.160
 that I don't do the same thing for all athletes.

1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:16.200
 Everyone's got a different personality.

1:42:16.200 --> 1:42:19.560
 And like Nicky Rod, I can only hold his attention

1:42:19.560 --> 1:42:20.880
 for two minutes at a time.

1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:25.880
 And Gary Tonin, five minutes.

1:42:26.440 --> 1:42:28.320
 Gordon Ryan, five hours.

1:42:28.320 --> 1:42:31.640
 Like George St. Pierre, five hours.

1:42:31.640 --> 1:42:33.040
 Travis Stevens, five hours.

1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:35.400
 They are just laser focused.

1:42:35.400 --> 1:42:36.320
 So everyone's different.

1:42:36.320 --> 1:42:38.480
 Let's put that down as our first proviso.

1:42:40.680 --> 1:42:42.160
 You probably knew those answers already.

1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:43.000
 Yeah.

1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:45.160
 That's hilarious.

1:42:45.160 --> 1:42:49.280
 But as a general rule,

1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:51.920
 if I run a two and a half hour class,

1:42:53.760 --> 1:42:56.120
 you can expect an hour and a half of it to be,

1:42:57.640 --> 1:42:59.160
 I'm going to use the word drilling,

1:42:59.160 --> 1:43:01.600
 but I'm also going to say that this is too complex

1:43:01.600 --> 1:43:03.920
 of a story to give now with words.

1:43:03.920 --> 1:43:05.280
 I would need to demonstrate it.

1:43:05.280 --> 1:43:06.600
 But the way in which we drill

1:43:06.600 --> 1:43:08.360
 is not your standard method of drilling.

1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:09.840
 And then it's into sparring.

1:43:11.760 --> 1:43:12.720
 But if you give me a choice

1:43:12.720 --> 1:43:15.400
 between a bad drilling partner and sparring,

1:43:16.280 --> 1:43:19.440
 I could make the same choice that most black belts make,

1:43:19.440 --> 1:43:21.160
 which I would go with sparring.

1:43:21.160 --> 1:43:22.800
 Because you can create drilling

1:43:22.800 --> 1:43:24.880
 within the sparring environment.

1:43:26.480 --> 1:43:28.360
 Like good drilling is a wonderful thing.

1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:30.760
 Bad drilling is just a worthless waste of time.

1:43:33.560 --> 1:43:36.040
 Okay, before, I have a million questions for you,

1:43:36.040 --> 1:43:37.200
 but I have to ask,

1:43:37.200 --> 1:43:41.040
 can you, we've described the fundamentals of jiu jitsu.

1:43:41.040 --> 1:43:44.480
 Can we describe the principles, the fundamentals

1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:46.760
 of one of the interesting systems you've developed,

1:43:46.760 --> 1:43:49.200
 which is the leg lock system?

1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:50.960
 Yeah, anything in particular

1:43:50.960 --> 1:43:53.280
 or just like a general understanding

1:43:53.280 --> 1:43:55.840
 of what are some of the major principles of it?

1:43:55.840 --> 1:43:59.640
 Well, it's like me coming to Miyamoto Musashi and asking,

1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:03.920
 can you describe the principles of sword fighting?

1:44:03.920 --> 1:44:04.920
 You're too generous.

1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:08.480
 Let's start off with some context.

1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:13.480
 When I began the sport of jiu jitsu,

1:44:13.480 --> 1:44:18.480
 I was taught a fairly classical approach to jiu jitsu,

1:44:20.680 --> 1:44:23.200
 which leg locks were a part of it,

1:44:23.200 --> 1:44:25.040
 but not an emphasized part of it.

1:44:26.960 --> 1:44:30.160
 The overall culture of the times is the mid 1990s.

1:44:30.160 --> 1:44:34.160
 The overall culture of the time saw leg locks

1:44:34.160 --> 1:44:39.160
 as largely ineffective.

1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:44.840
 It was, we were told that against good opposition,

1:44:44.840 --> 1:44:46.000
 they just didn't work very well.

1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:48.160
 They were low percentage techniques.

1:44:48.160 --> 1:44:52.400
 We were also told that they were tactically unsound

1:44:52.400 --> 1:44:54.440
 because if you ever attempted them

1:44:54.440 --> 1:44:56.480
 and you lost control of the leg lock,

1:44:58.160 --> 1:44:59.640
 your opponent would end up on top of you

1:44:59.640 --> 1:45:01.280
 or in some kind of good position

1:45:01.280 --> 1:45:04.400
 and you'd be in terrible trouble.

1:45:04.400 --> 1:45:06.680
 And we were also told that they were unsafe,

1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:09.640
 that if they were applied in the gym,

1:45:09.640 --> 1:45:10.840
 there'd be far too many injuries

1:45:10.840 --> 1:45:12.440
 and people would be badly hurt.

1:45:13.320 --> 1:45:16.920
 And that was the received wisdom of that time.

1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:21.160
 And so I didn't even work with them at all.

1:45:21.160 --> 1:45:24.360
 And they would be shown occasionally in the gym

1:45:24.360 --> 1:45:26.880
 and you'd learn them, you'd drill them.

1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:31.240
 But in sparring, I showed no interest.

1:45:33.600 --> 1:45:35.600
 You probably know that change when I met

1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:38.200
 the great American grappler, Dean Lister,

1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:41.440
 who early in his career was using Achilles locks

1:45:41.440 --> 1:45:42.920
 with considerable success.

1:45:42.920 --> 1:45:45.240
 I met him in the gym, wonderful fellow.

1:45:45.240 --> 1:45:46.320
 And...

1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:48.120
 Achilles locks is like a straight full lock.

1:45:48.120 --> 1:45:49.720
 Yes, that's correct, yes.

1:45:49.720 --> 1:45:53.560
 And he went on to become a heel hooker

1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:56.440
 and win 280 CCs later on in his career.

1:45:56.440 --> 1:45:59.200
 But we never met again after that.

1:45:59.200 --> 1:46:04.200
 And that opened some doors of inquiry and...

1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:09.160
 Well, he asked this first principles question

1:46:09.160 --> 1:46:13.360
 is why would you only use half the body in a game

1:46:13.360 --> 1:46:14.720
 that involves the human body?

1:46:14.720 --> 1:46:15.760
 Perfect sense.

1:46:15.760 --> 1:46:18.760
 So that opened doors to inquiry.

1:46:18.760 --> 1:46:22.640
 And if you looked around the Jiu Jitsu world at that time,

1:46:22.640 --> 1:46:27.640
 the number of specialized leg lockers was very small.

1:46:27.920 --> 1:46:32.920
 And most of them were from outside of conventional Jiu Jitsu.

1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:35.880
 For example, you could look around and see people

1:46:35.880 --> 1:46:39.440
 like Romina Sato had sharp leg locks

1:46:39.440 --> 1:46:41.480
 for that time period in the 1990s.

1:46:43.120 --> 1:46:45.120
 So they were out there, they existed.

1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:47.280
 And you'd see people like Ken Shamrock

1:46:47.280 --> 1:46:50.240
 would use heel hooks in competition

1:46:50.240 --> 1:46:52.920
 and he had some good success with them.

1:46:55.200 --> 1:46:57.720
 When I began experimenting in the gym,

1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:03.960
 fairly soon, certain truths started to become evident.

1:47:03.960 --> 1:47:07.800
 And the most important of these

1:47:07.800 --> 1:47:09.160
 can be understood very quickly.

1:47:09.160 --> 1:47:11.640
 And they were relatively easy to discover.

1:47:13.160 --> 1:47:17.440
 The first was that most people,

1:47:17.440 --> 1:47:22.440
 when they went to understand and study leg locking.

1:47:24.560 --> 1:47:26.000
 And when I talk about leg locking,

1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:27.640
 I'm gonna talk about one specific type,

1:47:27.640 --> 1:47:29.800
 which is the most high percentage type.

1:47:29.800 --> 1:47:31.800
 This is leg locks, which are performed

1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:35.000
 with entanglements of your opponent's legs with your legs.

1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:36.320
 There are other forms of leg lock,

1:47:36.320 --> 1:47:38.120
 but these are relatively low percentage

1:47:38.120 --> 1:47:39.840
 and don't figure heavily in competition.

1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:41.360
 So I'll ignore them.

1:47:43.360 --> 1:47:45.920
 Most people made no distinction

1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:48.680
 between the mechanism of control

1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:51.760
 versus the mechanism of breaking.

1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:56.720
 The heel hook is what ultimately breaks the ankle.

1:47:56.720 --> 1:47:58.120
 But the mechanism of control

1:47:58.120 --> 1:48:01.720
 is the entanglement of your legs to your opponent's legs.

1:48:01.720 --> 1:48:03.880
 The Japanese term ashigurami

1:48:03.880 --> 1:48:05.920
 literally just means like leg entanglement.

1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:06.880
 It's a generic term.

1:48:06.880 --> 1:48:08.880
 It could apply to any form of entanglement.

1:48:08.880 --> 1:48:10.360
 There are many options.

1:48:10.360 --> 1:48:15.360
 My idea was let's focus on the entanglement first

1:48:16.160 --> 1:48:19.840
 and worry about the breaking mechanism second.

1:48:19.840 --> 1:48:23.600
 This was analogous to the idea of position before submission.

1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:25.080
 Only you couldn't talk about it

1:48:25.080 --> 1:48:27.240
 in terms of conventional positions

1:48:27.240 --> 1:48:29.800
 because ashigurami doesn't really fit

1:48:29.800 --> 1:48:31.920
 into the traditional hierarchies,

1:48:31.920 --> 1:48:33.880
 positional hierarchies of jiu jitsu.

1:48:33.880 --> 1:48:38.400
 So the conversation was switched from position to submission

1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:40.960
 to control to submission.

1:48:40.960 --> 1:48:44.040
 Now, wrapping two of your legs

1:48:44.040 --> 1:48:45.640
 around one of your opponent's legs

1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:46.880
 gives you many different options.

1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:48.840
 You can do it with your feet on the outside,

1:48:48.840 --> 1:48:50.600
 so called 50, 50 variations.

1:48:50.600 --> 1:48:52.240
 You can do it with your feet on the inside

1:48:52.240 --> 1:48:57.240
 and form what we call inside foot position.

1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:00.320
 There's pros and cons to both.

1:49:00.320 --> 1:49:03.040
 There's also methods of harmonizing the two.

1:49:03.040 --> 1:49:04.280
 So you have one foot on the inside

1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:05.760
 and one foot on the outside.

1:49:05.760 --> 1:49:09.720
 You can do it with a straight leg

1:49:09.720 --> 1:49:11.720
 where you heel hook from the outside

1:49:11.720 --> 1:49:13.560
 or you can bring the leg across your center line

1:49:13.560 --> 1:49:15.520
 and heel hook from the inside.

1:49:15.520 --> 1:49:18.000
 You will start to notice

1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:20.440
 as you work through these different variations

1:49:20.440 --> 1:49:24.360
 that some present advantages over others.

1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:29.360
 All of them come at a price to some degree,

1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:32.120
 regardless of which ashigurami option you use.

1:49:32.120 --> 1:49:34.720
 There will be some degree of foot exposure

1:49:34.720 --> 1:49:36.440
 on my part to my opponent

1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:38.680
 and some degree of back exposure

1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:40.520
 on my part relative to my opponent.

1:49:40.520 --> 1:49:42.800
 So that's the downside of it.

1:49:42.800 --> 1:49:46.800
 Variations within those different ashigurami

1:49:46.800 --> 1:49:51.000
 enable you to lessen danger in some respects

1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:54.960
 and at the price of gaining dangers in others.

1:49:54.960 --> 1:49:58.520
 So you get this wide array of choices.

1:49:58.520 --> 1:50:01.040
 There's not this kind of simplistic hierarchy

1:50:01.040 --> 1:50:03.720
 that you see in the basic position.

1:50:03.720 --> 1:50:05.480
 The basic positions of jiu jitsu,

1:50:05.480 --> 1:50:07.400
 but there are hierarchies.

1:50:07.400 --> 1:50:10.800
 I do, for example, generally favor inside heel hooks

1:50:10.800 --> 1:50:12.160
 over outside heel hooks.

1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:18.800
 If I feel my opponent is very good at exposing my back

1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:20.240
 while I'm in ashigurami,

1:50:20.240 --> 1:50:23.080
 I generally prefer 50, 50 situations.

1:50:23.080 --> 1:50:25.880
 If I believe my opponent is very good at counter leg locks,

1:50:25.880 --> 1:50:28.400
 I generally prefer my feet on the inside

1:50:28.400 --> 1:50:31.320
 working with variations of insides and kaku,

1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:32.360
 et cetera, et cetera.

1:50:32.360 --> 1:50:35.160
 So there are broad heuristic rules

1:50:35.160 --> 1:50:37.920
 that we can give to work in these situations.

1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:43.640
 Once you start to understand

1:50:43.640 --> 1:50:48.000
 there's a variety of entanglements you can use,

1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.920
 then you start getting into the really interesting ideas

1:50:50.920 --> 1:50:55.920
 that as you perform one given attack, one given heel hook,

1:50:56.600 --> 1:51:01.320
 you can flow through different forms of ashigurami

1:51:01.320 --> 1:51:04.760
 where you can create new dangers

1:51:04.760 --> 1:51:09.760
 and avoid possible pitfalls in a very short timeframe

1:51:11.720 --> 1:51:14.520
 as you switch from one ashigurami to another over time.

1:51:14.520 --> 1:51:16.760
 So that as your opponent's lines of resistance

1:51:16.760 --> 1:51:18.720
 to an initial attack change,

1:51:18.720 --> 1:51:19.920
 you can accommodate those

1:51:19.920 --> 1:51:22.320
 by switching to another form of ashigurami

1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:24.680
 so that your mechanism of control

1:51:24.680 --> 1:51:28.080
 is always pointing in opposite directions of his escape.

1:51:28.080 --> 1:51:32.920
 And if you focus on this idea of control through the legs,

1:51:32.920 --> 1:51:36.760
 you can completely change the nature of leg locking

1:51:36.760 --> 1:51:39.760
 and take it away from what it was in the 1990s

1:51:39.760 --> 1:51:42.040
 an opportunistic method of attack

1:51:42.040 --> 1:51:45.120
 based upon surprise, speed and power

1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:47.560
 into one based on control.

1:51:47.560 --> 1:51:48.840
 If you can do this,

1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:54.840
 you can undermine many of the basic criticisms

1:51:55.080 --> 1:51:57.840
 of leg locking which were prevalent when I began.

1:51:57.840 --> 1:52:01.320
 I began the sport of jiu jitsu.

1:52:01.320 --> 1:52:06.320
 For example, if I can completely control and immobilize you,

1:52:06.720 --> 1:52:10.040
 I can perform the lock very, very safely.

1:52:10.040 --> 1:52:11.800
 If my only way of breaking your leg

1:52:11.800 --> 1:52:14.840
 is to be faster and more powerful than you,

1:52:14.840 --> 1:52:16.440
 nine times out of 10 when I apply it,

1:52:16.440 --> 1:52:19.960
 I'm gonna hurt your leg as much by accident as anything.

1:52:19.960 --> 1:52:22.040
 But if I can completely immobilize you

1:52:22.040 --> 1:52:24.040
 and as every attempt you make to escape,

1:52:24.040 --> 1:52:28.000
 I can follow you and immobilize you in new directions,

1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:31.560
 then I can apply the lock with as much force

1:52:31.560 --> 1:52:33.880
 or as little force as possible.

1:52:33.880 --> 1:52:35.680
 And so you'll see in our training room

1:52:35.680 --> 1:52:40.400
 despite over considerably more than two decades,

1:52:40.400 --> 1:52:42.160
 sorry, a decade and a half now

1:52:42.160 --> 1:52:44.360
 of heel hooking using these methods,

1:52:46.280 --> 1:52:50.680
 the number of people severely injured by heel hooks is tiny.

1:52:50.680 --> 1:52:55.680
 I would say I've seen more people injured by far

1:52:55.680 --> 1:52:58.680
 by kimuras in the time I've been training

1:52:58.680 --> 1:53:00.040
 than I have by heel hooks,

1:53:00.040 --> 1:53:04.200
 despite them having a similar twisting dynamic to them.

1:53:05.920 --> 1:53:09.840
 If you build a culture where people focus on control

1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:11.920
 rather than speed of execution,

1:53:11.920 --> 1:53:15.080
 then the injury rate goes down appreciably.

1:53:15.080 --> 1:53:16.920
 The whole idea of positional loss,

1:53:16.920 --> 1:53:18.600
 everyone was critical of leg locks.

1:53:18.600 --> 1:53:20.280
 Now, if you go for leg locks and they don't work,

1:53:20.280 --> 1:53:21.880
 well, now you're in trouble.

1:53:21.880 --> 1:53:23.360
 The guy's gonna be on top of you.

1:53:23.360 --> 1:53:25.560
 They never make that criticism with armbars.

1:53:26.440 --> 1:53:27.760
 Okay, you can be in the mounted position,

1:53:27.760 --> 1:53:29.360
 go for an armbar, end up on bottom,

1:53:29.360 --> 1:53:30.800
 lose the armbar and lose position,

1:53:30.800 --> 1:53:33.160
 but I've never heard anyone criticize armbars

1:53:33.160 --> 1:53:34.320
 on that account.

1:53:34.320 --> 1:53:38.440
 More importantly, I believed from early on

1:53:38.440 --> 1:53:41.600
 that the best place to attack leg locks is not top position,

1:53:41.600 --> 1:53:43.040
 it's bottom position.

1:53:43.040 --> 1:53:45.880
 You'll see that over 90% of my athletes

1:53:45.880 --> 1:53:47.640
 attack leg locks from underneath people,

1:53:47.640 --> 1:53:48.800
 not on top of people.

1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:50.120
 So there is no positional loss.

1:53:50.120 --> 1:53:51.800
 You're already underneath them.

1:53:51.800 --> 1:53:54.480
 And so that criticism was null and void.

1:53:56.600 --> 1:54:01.240
 And by focusing on this idea of breaking down

1:54:01.240 --> 1:54:04.000
 and distinguishing between the mechanism of control

1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:06.000
 and the mechanism of breaking,

1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:08.760
 that created something new and something interesting.

1:54:09.600 --> 1:54:13.160
 There was also another advantage that I had

1:54:13.160 --> 1:54:17.320
 in terms of creating influence with leg locking.

1:54:17.320 --> 1:54:19.640
 When you look at the great leg lockers of the past,

1:54:19.640 --> 1:54:21.880
 they were basically iconoclasts.

1:54:21.880 --> 1:54:24.000
 They were people who came out of nowhere

1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:28.440
 who just had this remarkable success with leg locks.

1:54:30.200 --> 1:54:35.200
 But they were just seen as unique individuals.

1:54:36.400 --> 1:54:39.000
 They had their game and they were good at it.

1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:40.400
 What was unique about the squad

1:54:40.400 --> 1:54:43.160
 is you had not just one person,

1:54:43.160 --> 1:54:45.240
 but a team of people who came out

1:54:45.240 --> 1:54:47.800
 and did pretty much the same thing.

1:54:47.800 --> 1:54:50.080
 These people had very different body types

1:54:50.080 --> 1:54:52.440
 and very different personalities.

1:54:52.440 --> 1:54:55.120
 So it wasn't that one kind of body type was good at it.

1:54:55.120 --> 1:54:57.680
 You had tall people like Gordon Ryan.

1:54:57.680 --> 1:55:00.480
 You had short people like Nikki Ryan.

1:55:00.480 --> 1:55:03.520
 You had someone in the middle like Gary Tonin.

1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:05.240
 You had fast people like Gary Tonin.

1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:06.840
 You had slow people like Gordon.

1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:12.520
 There was every kind of body type involved.

1:55:12.520 --> 1:55:14.600
 And it was like, people could see this was different

1:55:14.600 --> 1:55:17.760
 because it worked for an entire team

1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:19.800
 as opposed to a unique individual

1:55:19.800 --> 1:55:21.840
 who had unique attributes.

1:55:21.840 --> 1:55:23.960
 And then started to foster the belief

1:55:23.960 --> 1:55:28.520
 that if it can work for a team, it can work for anyone,

1:55:28.520 --> 1:55:31.160
 which means it can work for me.

1:55:31.160 --> 1:55:33.400
 And I think that had a big effect.

1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:37.880
 That's why I owe a lot to those early students,

1:55:39.680 --> 1:55:44.680
 Gordon Ryan, Gary Tonin, Eddie Cummings, and Nikki Ryan.

1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:48.800
 And those four kids came from nowhere.

1:55:50.880 --> 1:55:53.680
 Gary had some success in grappling,

1:55:53.680 --> 1:55:55.480
 like low level success in grappling

1:55:55.480 --> 1:56:00.200
 before becoming a full time member of the squad.

1:56:00.200 --> 1:56:04.720
 But the others were just nobodies who no one had known.

1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:07.000
 And yet within a five year timeframe,

1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:10.240
 they were all going up against world championship competition

1:56:10.240 --> 1:56:13.280
 and doing exceedingly well.

1:56:13.280 --> 1:56:16.160
 And which gives further credence

1:56:16.160 --> 1:56:18.600
 to the idea of the five year program.

1:56:18.600 --> 1:56:23.600
 And I think by operating as a team,

1:56:24.280 --> 1:56:26.360
 those young men did an incredible job

1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:28.400
 of convincing the grappling world

1:56:28.400 --> 1:56:31.360
 that this wasn't just about, well, they're just different

1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:35.760
 or it works for their body type or them as individuals.

1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:39.360
 It was like, no, if a team can do it, anyone can do it.

1:56:39.360 --> 1:56:41.880
 And I think that's what really convinced people

1:56:41.880 --> 1:56:44.000
 that this was something worth studying.

1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:46.840
 This is something that could be a big part of their lives.

1:56:46.840 --> 1:56:49.480
 But also convinced you and convinced each other

1:56:49.480 --> 1:56:52.400
 in those early days when you're developing the science.

1:56:52.400 --> 1:56:53.560
 Essentially what was missing

1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:57.680
 is an entire science and system of leg locks.

1:56:57.680 --> 1:57:01.200
 Because it's not like you knew for sure

1:57:01.200 --> 1:57:03.680
 that there's a lot here to be discovered

1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:04.640
 in terms of control.

1:57:04.640 --> 1:57:08.720
 You perhaps hadn't, just like you said, an initial intuition,

1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:12.440
 but you have to have enough,

1:57:12.440 --> 1:57:14.320
 there's perseverance required to take,

1:57:14.320 --> 1:57:16.560
 it's the Johnny Ive thing to take from the initial idea

1:57:16.560 --> 1:57:17.760
 to an entire system.

1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:22.760
 Is there a sense you have about how complicated

1:57:22.920 --> 1:57:26.920
 and how big this world of control in leg locks is?

1:57:30.160 --> 1:57:31.840
 How complicated is it?

1:57:31.840 --> 1:57:33.480
 You've achieved a lot of success.

1:57:33.480 --> 1:57:35.360
 You have a lot of powerful ideas

1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:36.720
 in terms of inside, outside,

1:57:36.720 --> 1:57:38.520
 what's high percentage, what's not,

1:57:38.520 --> 1:57:40.840
 what's higher reward, what's a low risk,

1:57:40.840 --> 1:57:42.760
 all those kinds of things.

1:57:42.760 --> 1:57:45.600
 And then you also mentioned kind of transitions,

1:57:45.600 --> 1:57:49.360
 not transitions, but how you move with your opponent

1:57:49.360 --> 1:57:53.520
 to resist their escape through control.

1:57:53.520 --> 1:57:55.920
 How much do you understand about this world?

1:57:55.920 --> 1:57:57.720
 This is a fascinating question.

1:57:59.560 --> 1:58:04.560
 As a general rule, the most powerful developments

1:58:04.560 --> 1:58:08.040
 are always at the onset of a project, okay?

1:58:08.040 --> 1:58:09.360
 Let's give an example.

1:58:10.600 --> 1:58:15.600
 The jet engine was, I believe, first conceived

1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:20.120
 in the late 1930s, just around the time of World War II.

1:58:20.120 --> 1:58:25.120
 It was developed with great pace because of World War II.

1:58:25.200 --> 1:58:28.960
 Obviously, military research was a huge thing back then.

1:58:28.960 --> 1:58:32.960
 And first fielded, I believe, by the jet engine,

1:58:32.960 --> 1:58:37.960
 first fielded, I believe, by the Germans in around 1943.

1:58:40.880 --> 1:58:44.280
 Jet aircraft didn't play a big role in World War II.

1:58:44.280 --> 1:58:45.480
 They were there at the end

1:58:45.480 --> 1:58:47.880
 and they did play a significant role,

1:58:47.880 --> 1:58:50.400
 but in terms of numbers, they just weren't there.

1:58:52.400 --> 1:58:57.400
 So by around 1945, you had the onset of the jet age

1:58:57.400 --> 1:59:00.960
 and the jet engine began to replace the piston engine

1:59:00.960 --> 1:59:01.880
 in most aircraft.

1:59:01.880 --> 1:59:04.480
 It was the new way of doing things.

1:59:06.120 --> 1:59:10.440
 If you look at the pace of development

1:59:10.440 --> 1:59:15.440
 of jet engine aircraft technology from 1945 to 1960,

1:59:17.520 --> 1:59:20.120
 it is unbelievable.

1:59:21.120 --> 1:59:25.000
 There was a solid decade where they were gaining

1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:29.400
 almost 100 miles an hour per year for a decade.

1:59:29.400 --> 1:59:33.720
 That's a form of growth that, I mean,

1:59:33.720 --> 1:59:35.000
 in the world of engineering,

1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:38.160
 that's the only time you see growth like that

1:59:38.160 --> 1:59:41.960
 is in things like Bitcoin and that's about it, okay?

1:59:43.920 --> 1:59:46.120
 Let's put things in perspective, okay?

1:59:47.080 --> 1:59:51.160
 In World War II, the standard US aircraft bomber

1:59:51.160 --> 1:59:55.480
 was the B17, which was a midsize bomber

1:59:55.480 --> 1:59:57.760
 with a fairly limited load capacity

1:59:57.760 --> 2:00:02.760
 and I think top speed well below 300 miles an hour.

2:00:04.440 --> 2:00:08.200
 Just 10 years later, you had the B52,

2:00:08.200 --> 2:00:10.200
 which could fly across continents

2:00:10.200 --> 2:00:12.320
 and deliver nuclear weapons

2:00:12.320 --> 2:00:15.400
 and carry bomb loads of up to 70,000 pounds.

2:00:17.160 --> 2:00:19.080
 In a decade, that happened.

2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:24.160
 If you took a B17 pilot in 1943

2:00:24.160 --> 2:00:27.480
 and put them inside a B52 a decade later,

2:00:27.480 --> 2:00:30.280
 he would literally think he was on a UFO,

2:00:30.280 --> 2:00:32.800
 a ship from another planet.

2:00:32.800 --> 2:00:36.040
 That was the speed of development.

2:00:36.040 --> 2:00:39.960
 Now, contrast that with the speed of modern development.

2:00:40.880 --> 2:00:42.520
 If I took you in a time machine

2:00:43.680 --> 2:00:48.120
 and I put you in a civil airliner in 1972,

2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:51.720
 let's say a Boeing 737,

2:00:52.640 --> 2:00:55.520
 it's not that different from what you fly in today.

2:00:55.520 --> 2:00:59.120
 Flies at the same speed, has the same range,

2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:01.120
 flies at the same altitude.

2:01:01.120 --> 2:01:02.960
 It's not that different.

2:01:02.960 --> 2:01:07.120
 The amount of progress between 1973 and 2020

2:01:08.280 --> 2:01:09.560
 isn't very impressive,

2:01:10.480 --> 2:01:14.840
 but the amount of progress from 1945 to 1955,

2:01:14.840 --> 2:01:17.520
 or even better, 1960 was staggering.

2:01:18.600 --> 2:01:23.200
 And so the initial progress tends to be meteoric,

2:01:23.200 --> 2:01:25.720
 but after that, it tends to be incremental.

2:01:25.720 --> 2:01:30.480
 That said, there's a guy named Elon Musk.

2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:32.560
 There's been almost no development

2:01:32.560 --> 2:01:37.560
 in terms of space rocket propulsion

2:01:38.800 --> 2:01:43.720
 and rocket launches and going out into orbit

2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:45.720
 or going out into deep space.

2:01:45.720 --> 2:01:47.800
 And one guy comes along,

2:01:47.800 --> 2:01:50.280
 one John Donahue type character,

2:01:50.280 --> 2:01:53.160
 and says, it doesn't make sense why we don't use

2:01:53.160 --> 2:01:56.400
 reusable rockets, why we don't make them much cheaper,

2:01:56.400 --> 2:01:58.440
 why we don't launch every week

2:01:58.440 --> 2:02:00.880
 as opposed to every few years.

2:02:00.880 --> 2:02:04.120
 It doesn't make any sense why we don't go to the moon again

2:02:04.120 --> 2:02:05.120
 over and over and over.

2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:07.320
 It doesn't make any sense why we don't go to Mars

2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:09.360
 and colonize Mars.

2:02:09.360 --> 2:02:14.360
 It feels like it's not just a single jump to a B52.

2:02:15.640 --> 2:02:18.440
 It's a series of these kinds of jumps.

2:02:18.440 --> 2:02:21.720
 So the question is, is there another leap

2:02:21.720 --> 2:02:24.120
 within the leg locking system?

2:02:24.120 --> 2:02:25.280
 Time will tell.

2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:30.320
 I do believe that we're in a phase now

2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:33.920
 where the really big jumps have already been made

2:02:33.920 --> 2:02:36.520
 and we're in the incremental phase at this point.

2:02:37.720 --> 2:02:39.480
 What I do believe is that you will start

2:02:39.480 --> 2:02:42.440
 to see new directions start to emerge,

2:02:42.440 --> 2:02:44.040
 where you start to see the interface

2:02:44.040 --> 2:02:46.560
 between leg locking and race link, for example.

2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:49.440
 The interface between leg locking and back attacks.

2:02:49.440 --> 2:02:52.640
 And that will provide new avenues of direction

2:02:52.640 --> 2:02:56.520
 which will create new spurts of growth.

2:02:57.600 --> 2:03:00.880
 But in terms of breaking people's legs,

2:03:00.880 --> 2:03:03.160
 just the simple act of breaking legs,

2:03:03.160 --> 2:03:04.880
 I believe we're in the incremental phase now

2:03:04.880 --> 2:03:06.880
 rather than the meteoric phase.

2:03:06.880 --> 2:03:08.360
 Let me ask you a ridiculous question.

2:03:08.360 --> 2:03:10.960
 How hard is it to actually break a leg?

2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:12.160
 Is this something you think about?

2:03:12.160 --> 2:03:13.760
 I remember, because I'm a big fan

2:03:13.760 --> 2:03:17.280
 of the straight foot lock, not, again,

2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:19.720
 we're talking about to the standing Seoi Nage.

2:03:19.720 --> 2:03:22.120
 Maybe it's my Russian roots with Samba

2:03:22.120 --> 2:03:22.960
 or something like that.

2:03:22.960 --> 2:03:26.760
 Maybe it's the Dean Lister, Achilles lock.

2:03:26.760 --> 2:03:30.320
 But I love, maybe it's my body, something like that.

2:03:30.320 --> 2:03:34.000
 I just love the squeeze of it, the control

2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:38.200
 and the power of a straight foot lock.

2:03:38.200 --> 2:03:42.800
 And I remember trying to,

2:03:42.800 --> 2:03:44.480
 there's a few people in competition

2:03:44.480 --> 2:03:45.920
 that didn't want to tap.

2:03:45.920 --> 2:03:47.040
 Absolutely.

2:03:47.040 --> 2:03:52.040
 And I remember in particular, there was one person,

2:03:52.040 --> 2:03:54.040
 again, the finals match, Purple Belt.

2:03:54.040 --> 2:03:56.720
 I remember it was a straight foot lock, it was perfect.

2:03:56.720 --> 2:03:58.120
 Everything just perfect.

2:03:58.120 --> 2:04:03.120
 And I remember going all in and there was a pop, pop, pop.

2:04:03.400 --> 2:04:05.400
 And I couldn't do anything more.

2:04:05.400 --> 2:04:06.960
 It wasn't breaking.

2:04:06.960 --> 2:04:09.320
 It was just bending and bending and bending.

2:04:09.320 --> 2:04:12.160
 And there's damage to it of some kind.

2:04:12.160 --> 2:04:15.880
 But I wanted to like, you know, I wanted to see,

2:04:15.880 --> 2:04:18.000
 first of all, it's very difficult psychologically

2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:20.760
 because it's like, can I be violent here?

2:04:20.760 --> 2:04:22.800
 That was a whole nother thing.

2:04:22.800 --> 2:04:25.200
 With adrenaline, you can't really think that fast.

2:04:25.200 --> 2:04:27.960
 But I also thought like, where else is there to go?

2:04:27.960 --> 2:04:29.600
 Like, is it the shin going to break?

2:04:29.600 --> 2:04:31.080
 What is it supposed to break?

2:04:31.080 --> 2:04:31.920
 So I wondered that.

2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:33.440
 Yeah, in the case of the Achilles lock,

2:04:33.440 --> 2:04:35.800
 it's going to be the anterior tibialis tendon.

2:04:35.800 --> 2:04:36.640
 What's that?

2:04:36.640 --> 2:04:39.160
 That's the, it runs down, there's two of them.

2:04:39.160 --> 2:04:41.040
 It'll be the minor one that runs on the outside

2:04:41.040 --> 2:04:42.760
 of the front of the ankle.

2:04:42.760 --> 2:04:44.280
 It's not going to be the Achilles tendon.

2:04:44.280 --> 2:04:47.920
 A lot of people promulgate this absurdity.

2:04:47.920 --> 2:04:51.480
 The Achilles tendon can rupture, but not from pressure.

2:04:51.480 --> 2:04:54.120
 Does the tendon or the bone, it's going to break?

2:04:54.120 --> 2:04:56.040
 The bone won't break.

2:04:56.040 --> 2:04:57.920
 I have seen on one occasion,

2:04:57.920 --> 2:05:01.120
 a shin bone break from an Achilles lock,

2:05:01.120 --> 2:05:04.520
 but there was an enormous size and strength disparity.

2:05:04.520 --> 2:05:07.540
 And there may have been other complicating factors too.

2:05:07.540 --> 2:05:11.480
 But in the vast majority of cases,

2:05:11.480 --> 2:05:15.000
 the Achilles lock doesn't really do tremendous damage.

2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:17.080
 It can do significant damage.

2:05:17.080 --> 2:05:18.240
 You'll definitely feel it the next day,

2:05:18.240 --> 2:05:20.800
 but it's, of all the major locks,

2:05:20.800 --> 2:05:23.400
 it's the one where it is most likely

2:05:23.400 --> 2:05:25.120
 a psychologically strong opponent

2:05:25.120 --> 2:05:27.840
 will be able to absorb damage and go on to win a match.

2:05:28.800 --> 2:05:30.440
 In answer to your first question,

2:05:30.440 --> 2:05:32.340
 how difficult is it to break a leg?

2:05:33.520 --> 2:05:34.480
 Not very difficult.

2:05:34.480 --> 2:05:37.720
 It will come down to what is the skill level

2:05:37.720 --> 2:05:38.840
 of my opponent's resistance?

2:05:38.840 --> 2:05:40.160
 If your opponent is not resisting

2:05:40.160 --> 2:05:41.280
 and you have an inside heel hook,

2:05:41.280 --> 2:05:44.080
 it is absurdly easy to break a man's leg.

2:05:44.080 --> 2:05:45.200
 Not a challenge at all.

2:05:46.340 --> 2:05:48.420
 You can be a 105 pound woman,

2:05:48.420 --> 2:05:53.420
 could easily snap the relevant knee ligaments

2:05:54.680 --> 2:05:56.640
 in a 240 pound man's leg

2:05:56.640 --> 2:05:58.540
 if he doesn't know how to defend himself.

2:05:58.540 --> 2:06:02.000
 That's an easy thing, very easy to accomplish.

2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:06.160
 So the basic answer is yes, it's very easy.

2:06:06.160 --> 2:06:08.040
 If your opponent does know how to defend

2:06:08.040 --> 2:06:10.480
 and they can position their foot,

2:06:10.480 --> 2:06:13.000
 play tricks of lever and fulcrum,

2:06:13.000 --> 2:06:14.640
 it becomes significantly more difficult.

2:06:14.640 --> 2:06:17.600
 It becomes still more difficult under match conditions

2:06:17.600 --> 2:06:21.240
 where they're actively looking to position their body

2:06:21.240 --> 2:06:23.640
 and work their way out of the lock,

2:06:23.640 --> 2:06:26.040
 then it can become very difficult indeed.

2:06:26.040 --> 2:06:31.040
 Always bear in mind that there have been some cases

2:06:32.180 --> 2:06:35.680
 in our history as a team where people have literally

2:06:35.680 --> 2:06:40.680
 just let their knees snap and continue fighting.

2:06:43.100 --> 2:06:45.760
 Always remember that submission is a choice

2:06:45.760 --> 2:06:47.680
 when it comes to the joint locks.

2:06:47.680 --> 2:06:51.480
 And we've had some people who just made the choice

2:06:51.480 --> 2:06:54.080
 that I'm willing to let my knee break

2:06:54.080 --> 2:06:56.840
 so that I can continue in this match.

2:06:56.840 --> 2:06:59.640
 That's a tough decision to make and I admire their bravery.

2:07:00.720 --> 2:07:02.160
 Is there something about that,

2:07:02.160 --> 2:07:04.920
 just to speak to that, that you admire?

2:07:04.920 --> 2:07:07.440
 Yes, it's mental toughness.

2:07:07.440 --> 2:07:09.080
 Would I agree with it, would I advocate it?

2:07:09.080 --> 2:07:12.820
 No, but that doesn't mean I can't admire aspects of it.

2:07:14.320 --> 2:07:17.320
 Who is the greatest grappler ever?

2:07:18.200 --> 2:07:23.200
 You were very astute in the way you asked that question.

2:07:23.200 --> 2:07:26.680
 You didn't say the greatest jiu jitsu player of all time,

2:07:26.680 --> 2:07:28.100
 you specified grappler.

2:07:28.100 --> 2:07:29.840
 What's the bigger category?

2:07:29.840 --> 2:07:31.520
 Jiu jitsu is the bigger category.

2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:33.920
 Jiu jitsu has four faces.

2:07:33.920 --> 2:07:37.720
 There is gi competition, there is no gi competition,

2:07:37.720 --> 2:07:40.120
 there is mixed martial arts competition,

2:07:40.120 --> 2:07:41.800
 and there is self defense.

2:07:41.800 --> 2:07:43.640
 So jiu jitsu has four aspects.

2:07:44.860 --> 2:07:49.560
 Grappling typically refers only to the no gi

2:07:49.560 --> 2:07:53.040
 aspect of jiu jitsu, so it's one out of four possibilities.

2:07:53.040 --> 2:07:56.480
 So who's the greatest jiu jitsu practitioner ever,

2:07:56.480 --> 2:07:58.920
 and then who is the greatest grappler ever?

2:07:58.920 --> 2:08:02.840
 I believe that the greatest jiu jitsu player,

2:08:02.840 --> 2:08:05.480
 certainly that I ever met, and I believe of all time,

2:08:05.480 --> 2:08:08.640
 I don't want to sound arrogant on that

2:08:08.640 --> 2:08:10.880
 because really you can only go with your own experiences

2:08:10.880 --> 2:08:13.600
 and there are some great athletes that other people mention

2:08:13.600 --> 2:08:15.000
 that I just never met.

2:08:15.000 --> 2:08:19.380
 So, but in my estimation, the greatest jiu jitsu player

2:08:19.380 --> 2:08:24.080
 is Haja Gracie, my reasoning for that is

2:08:25.480 --> 2:08:30.480
 out of the four faces of jiu jitsu, he excelled in three.

2:08:31.400 --> 2:08:34.080
 And in two of them in particular,

2:08:34.080 --> 2:08:36.820
 he was the best of his generation by a landslide.

2:08:38.280 --> 2:08:41.920
 In gi grappling, no gi grappling,

2:08:41.920 --> 2:08:46.400
 Haja dominated his generation to a degree

2:08:46.400 --> 2:08:50.360
 that is truly impressive.

2:08:51.600 --> 2:08:53.400
 What do you attribute that dominance to, by the way?

2:08:53.400 --> 2:08:56.000
 Is there something, if you were to analyze him?

2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:58.840
 Fascinating question, I'll come back to it.

2:08:58.840 --> 2:09:02.220
 In mixed martial arts, he was at his peak,

2:09:03.520 --> 2:09:05.800
 I believe ranked in the top 10

2:09:05.800 --> 2:09:09.400
 in the world of mixed martial arts.

2:09:09.400 --> 2:09:11.880
 He wasn't the best in mixed martial arts

2:09:11.880 --> 2:09:14.280
 the way he was in grappling, but he was damn good.

2:09:14.280 --> 2:09:17.160
 And he beat some significant people.

2:09:17.160 --> 2:09:19.560
 So he showed tremendous versatility,

2:09:19.560 --> 2:09:21.800
 gi, no gi, mixed martial arts.

2:09:21.800 --> 2:09:24.000
 He's not really known in the world of self defense,

2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:26.280
 but there's no real criteria by which

2:09:26.280 --> 2:09:28.120
 you would become dominant in self defense.

2:09:28.120 --> 2:09:31.520
 So that's kind of a, you can't really judge people by that.

2:09:31.520 --> 2:09:34.080
 Believe me, if Haja got into a fight in the street,

2:09:34.080 --> 2:09:36.160
 I'm sure he would do just fine.

2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:38.260
 So I have no concerns about that.

2:09:40.240 --> 2:09:42.600
 So I would say that if you look at jiu jitsu

2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:46.280
 for what I believe it is, a sport with four faces,

2:09:46.280 --> 2:09:50.000
 I believe you have to go with Haja Gracie

2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:53.800
 as the one who went out and empirically proved

2:09:53.800 --> 2:09:58.360
 his ability to go across those elements

2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:01.200
 and do extraordinarily well in all of them.

2:10:01.200 --> 2:10:04.100
 He even made the extraordinary step

2:10:04.100 --> 2:10:06.900
 of coming out of retirement and beating the best

2:10:06.900 --> 2:10:09.520
 of the generation that came after him.

2:10:09.520 --> 2:10:10.360
 That's Asha?

2:10:10.360 --> 2:10:11.920
 Yes, that's a truly difficult feat.

2:10:11.920 --> 2:10:12.760
 That was incredible.

2:10:12.760 --> 2:10:15.160
 Yeah, and a sport which progresses very, very rapidly,

2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:17.160
 that's a truly impressive accomplishment.

2:10:18.360 --> 2:10:22.400
 If you ask the question who is the greatest grappler

2:10:22.400 --> 2:10:26.880
 that I've ever seen, I would say I've never seen

2:10:26.880 --> 2:10:28.480
 anyone better than Gordon Ryan.

2:10:29.400 --> 2:10:32.680
 Now people are gonna jump when I give these two names.

2:10:32.680 --> 2:10:34.880
 They're gonna say, well, Dan, you're close friends

2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:37.640
 with Haja and you're close friends with Gordon,

2:10:37.640 --> 2:10:38.620
 so you're biased.

2:10:38.620 --> 2:10:42.780
 I can't answer them to that, it's true.

2:10:42.780 --> 2:10:44.580
 I'm good friends with both of them.

2:10:45.540 --> 2:10:49.780
 I'm also a notoriously cold and unemotional person

2:10:49.780 --> 2:10:54.780
 and I'm saying this based upon things that I've observed.

2:10:54.780 --> 2:10:57.700
 If I honestly believed that I'd seen other people

2:10:57.700 --> 2:10:59.540
 who were better, I would have said it.

2:11:02.020 --> 2:11:06.180
 Will that convince the people who criticize me

2:11:06.180 --> 2:11:08.600
 are biased, probably not, but those are the two names

2:11:08.600 --> 2:11:09.440
 that I will mention.

2:11:09.440 --> 2:11:11.620
 I think it's an uncontroversial statement to say

2:11:11.620 --> 2:11:16.620
 that Gordon Ryan is one of the greatest grappler ever.

2:11:17.220 --> 2:11:19.740
 Yeah, Gordon's obviously a very polarizing figure

2:11:19.740 --> 2:11:23.460
 and people tend to react to Gordon on an emotional level

2:11:23.460 --> 2:11:26.700
 rather than a statistical level

2:11:26.700 --> 2:11:29.060
 and that colors a lot of people's minds,

2:11:29.060 --> 2:11:31.740
 but I also have the benefit that I've seen both

2:11:31.740 --> 2:11:33.660
 of these guys extensively in the gym

2:11:33.660 --> 2:11:36.420
 and that adds a whole new perspective.

2:11:36.420 --> 2:11:40.060
 If you think those guys are dominant on the stage,

2:11:40.060 --> 2:11:41.380
 wait till you see them in the gym.

2:11:41.380 --> 2:11:43.420
 It's even a different level of domination

2:11:43.420 --> 2:11:46.640
 above and beyond what they did in competition.

2:11:47.520 --> 2:11:50.140
 Have they trained against each other in the gym?

2:11:50.140 --> 2:11:51.100
 No, they never trained together.

2:11:51.100 --> 2:11:53.640
 They've been in the same gym, I think, only on one occasion.

2:11:53.640 --> 2:11:55.420
 When Hodger was stopped by New York,

2:11:55.420 --> 2:11:59.380
 he came by to say hello and Gordon was here at the time.

2:11:59.380 --> 2:12:01.580
 They shake hands, they know each other

2:12:01.580 --> 2:12:04.900
 and they're both wonderful people in their own way.

2:12:04.900 --> 2:12:08.300
 So I'd like to talk to you about Gordon,

2:12:08.300 --> 2:12:12.200
 Hodger and George GSP.

2:12:13.180 --> 2:12:14.940
 Let's first talk about what do you think,

2:12:14.940 --> 2:12:17.260
 because it's very different from my perspective,

2:12:17.260 --> 2:12:21.900
 maybe you can correct me, but very different artists,

2:12:21.900 --> 2:12:24.500
 masters of their pursuits.

2:12:24.500 --> 2:12:26.700
 So what makes Hodger so good?

2:12:28.320 --> 2:12:32.180
 Hodger was probably the living embodiment

2:12:32.180 --> 2:12:36.780
 of someone who played a classical jiu jitsu game

2:12:36.780 --> 2:12:40.820
 based around the fundamental four steps of jiu jitsu.

2:12:40.820 --> 2:12:44.660
 And like if you took someone

2:12:44.660 --> 2:12:49.460
 who had taken introduction lessons in jiu jitsu

2:12:49.460 --> 2:12:54.460
 for three months, they would recognize the outlines

2:12:55.140 --> 2:12:59.180
 of Hodger's game with many of the techniques

2:12:59.180 --> 2:13:02.540
 they learned in those first three months.

2:13:02.540 --> 2:13:06.700
 Hodger was the best example of the dichotomy

2:13:06.700 --> 2:13:09.980
 between the fundamentals of jiu jitsu,

2:13:09.980 --> 2:13:13.420
 but also a kind of hidden sophistication

2:13:13.420 --> 2:13:15.620
 underneath those fundamentals.

2:13:17.600 --> 2:13:20.700
 People always say, oh, Hodger's game was so basic.

2:13:20.700 --> 2:13:24.480
 No, the outlines of Hodger's game were basic,

2:13:24.480 --> 2:13:26.220
 but the degree of sophistication

2:13:26.220 --> 2:13:31.220
 and the application was extraordinary, and his ability

2:13:32.260 --> 2:13:37.260
 to refine existing technology was truly impressive.

2:13:39.660 --> 2:13:42.540
 I never saw anyone in his generation

2:13:42.540 --> 2:13:45.160
 that even came close to his ability,

2:13:45.160 --> 2:13:49.340
 both in competition and in the gym.

2:13:49.340 --> 2:13:50.740
 So for people who don't know,

2:13:50.740 --> 2:13:53.140
 Hodger Gracie basically used, just like you said,

2:13:53.140 --> 2:13:57.700
 a very simple techniques on the surface

2:13:57.700 --> 2:14:02.300
 from the outsider's perspective that most people learn

2:14:02.300 --> 2:14:05.420
 when they start jiu jitsu, like passing guard

2:14:05.420 --> 2:14:09.840
 in a very simple way, taking mount and choking from mount.

2:14:09.840 --> 2:14:13.580
 Also, when he's on his back, it's closed guard

2:14:13.580 --> 2:14:15.580
 and all the basic submissions from closed guard,

2:14:15.580 --> 2:14:20.580
 arm bar and triangle, and just, that's it.

2:14:20.580 --> 2:14:25.580
 And being able to dominate, shut down, and submit.

2:14:25.980 --> 2:14:29.420
 So control and submit the best people in the world

2:14:29.420 --> 2:14:32.420
 for many, many years, just like you said,

2:14:32.420 --> 2:14:37.420
 including coming out of retirement and beating the best,

2:14:37.520 --> 2:14:40.540
 perhaps by far the best of the next generation.

2:14:40.540 --> 2:14:43.020
 So that just kind of lays out the story.

2:14:43.020 --> 2:14:48.020
 Is there some lessons about his systems

2:14:48.020 --> 2:14:52.420
 that you learn in developing your own systems?

2:14:52.420 --> 2:14:53.380
 Excellent question.

2:14:54.420 --> 2:14:58.420
 The thing which always impressed me the most about Hodger

2:14:58.420 --> 2:15:03.420
 was his relentless pursuit of position to submission.

2:15:05.660 --> 2:15:09.960
 Everything was done with the belief

2:15:09.960 --> 2:15:14.140
 that no victory was worthwhile

2:15:14.140 --> 2:15:16.920
 if it didn't involve submitting his opponent.

2:15:16.920 --> 2:15:20.020
 That's a mindset that I tried very, very hard

2:15:20.020 --> 2:15:22.040
 to imbue in my students.

2:15:22.040 --> 2:15:24.180
 The easiest path to victory in jiu jitsu

2:15:24.180 --> 2:15:27.340
 is the one which takes the least risk.

2:15:27.340 --> 2:15:30.480
 So for example, you will see many modern athletes

2:15:30.480 --> 2:15:34.020
 focus on scoring the first point or the first advantage,

2:15:34.020 --> 2:15:36.700
 and then doing the minimum amount of work

2:15:36.700 --> 2:15:40.380
 to eke out a victory once they've done that.

2:15:40.380 --> 2:15:42.260
 They get a small tactical advantage,

2:15:42.260 --> 2:15:44.780
 they realize they're ahead, take no more risks,

2:15:44.780 --> 2:15:48.200
 and just do the minimum amount of work to get the victory.

2:15:49.100 --> 2:15:52.220
 Hodger's mindset was always to take

2:15:52.220 --> 2:15:54.940
 the riskier gambit of submission,

2:15:54.940 --> 2:15:56.780
 which entails a lot more work,

2:15:56.780 --> 2:15:58.580
 and in many cases, a lot more skill.

2:16:01.380 --> 2:16:03.020
 What I always liked about Hodger

2:16:03.020 --> 2:16:05.900
 is he never tried to play tactics.

2:16:05.900 --> 2:16:08.620
 It was always just go out there

2:16:08.620 --> 2:16:10.300
 and try to win by submission.

2:16:11.340 --> 2:16:14.180
 And that more than anything,

2:16:14.180 --> 2:16:19.180
 that mindset of looking for the most perfect victory

2:16:19.620 --> 2:16:23.100
 rather than the victory that takes the least skill

2:16:23.100 --> 2:16:26.860
 and the least effort is probably the thing

2:16:26.860 --> 2:16:28.760
 I took from his career the most

2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:30.780
 and tried to work on in my students.

2:16:32.560 --> 2:16:35.440
 I always wonder what are the little details

2:16:35.440 --> 2:16:38.100
 he's doing under there when he's in mount,

2:16:38.100 --> 2:16:39.900
 the little adjustments.

2:16:39.900 --> 2:16:43.200
 But perhaps that's almost indescribable,

2:16:43.200 --> 2:16:45.100
 the details of that control.

2:16:47.500 --> 2:16:52.500
 What makes Gordon Ryan, the greatest grappler of all time,

2:16:52.660 --> 2:16:53.940
 so good?

2:16:53.940 --> 2:16:56.620
 With Gordon, he's also very strong on fundamentals,

2:16:56.620 --> 2:16:58.100
 all of my students are,

2:16:58.100 --> 2:17:01.580
 but he's also obviously a member

2:17:01.580 --> 2:17:04.060
 of a new generation of no geek grapplers

2:17:04.060 --> 2:17:06.500
 that also bring in technologies

2:17:06.500 --> 2:17:09.660
 that weren't really emphasized

2:17:09.660 --> 2:17:12.200
 in previous generations specifically.

2:17:12.200 --> 2:17:16.660
 The prolific use of lower body attacks,

2:17:16.660 --> 2:17:18.300
 especially from bottom position.

2:17:20.340 --> 2:17:22.300
 This means that he can play a game

2:17:22.300 --> 2:17:24.940
 between upper body and lower body,

2:17:24.940 --> 2:17:28.040
 which was not really a part of Hodges game.

2:17:29.300 --> 2:17:32.380
 Nonetheless, you will also see significant similarities.

2:17:32.380 --> 2:17:35.860
 He's got a very strong and crushing passing game to mount

2:17:35.860 --> 2:17:42.700
 and a very strong and crushing passing game to the back.

2:17:42.700 --> 2:17:46.660
 You will see that the major differences

2:17:46.660 --> 2:17:49.100
 between the two are from bottom position.

2:17:49.100 --> 2:17:51.060
 Hodges bottom game is essentially based

2:17:51.060 --> 2:17:52.340
 around his close guard.

2:17:52.340 --> 2:17:55.420
 Gordon Ryan's game is based around his butterfly guard.

2:17:55.420 --> 2:17:57.420
 So one is based on outside control

2:17:57.420 --> 2:18:00.060
 and one is based on inside control.

2:18:00.060 --> 2:18:03.180
 One focuses almost entirely on the classical notion

2:18:03.180 --> 2:18:05.840
 of getting past the legs to the upper body

2:18:05.840 --> 2:18:08.380
 and the other one works between the two as alternatives

2:18:08.380 --> 2:18:10.640
 and sees them as competing alternatives

2:18:10.640 --> 2:18:12.540
 where the stronger you become at one,

2:18:12.540 --> 2:18:14.220
 the more your opponent has to overreact

2:18:14.220 --> 2:18:16.180
 and become vulnerable to the second.

2:18:16.180 --> 2:18:19.260
 So they have strong similarities in top position

2:18:19.260 --> 2:18:20.900
 but are very different in bottom.

2:18:22.300 --> 2:18:25.520
 He has, from an outsider's perspective,

2:18:25.520 --> 2:18:30.520
 a calm to him in the heat of battle

2:18:30.520 --> 2:18:35.380
 that's inspiring and confusing.

2:18:35.380 --> 2:18:37.500
 Is there something you could speak

2:18:37.500 --> 2:18:40.700
 to the psychological aspect of Gordon Ryan?

2:18:40.700 --> 2:18:41.540
 Yes.

2:18:42.980 --> 2:18:47.560
 People will talk all day about sports psychology

2:18:47.560 --> 2:18:52.180
 and they will often have heated arguments

2:18:52.180 --> 2:18:55.000
 as to what's the right psychological state to be in

2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:56.680
 when you go out to compete.

2:18:56.680 --> 2:18:59.380
 I've never seen any one school of thought

2:18:59.380 --> 2:19:03.160
 which gave noticeably better sports performance than another.

2:19:03.160 --> 2:19:07.320
 I've never seen any psychological mindset

2:19:07.320 --> 2:19:11.040
 prove to be reliably more efficient

2:19:11.040 --> 2:19:13.880
 or effective than another.

2:19:13.880 --> 2:19:17.280
 I've seen fighters that were scared out of their minds

2:19:17.280 --> 2:19:19.200
 when they went out every time to fight

2:19:19.200 --> 2:19:20.980
 and yet they were very successful.

2:19:20.980 --> 2:19:23.980
 I've seen fighters go out who were relaxed and calm

2:19:23.980 --> 2:19:25.760
 and they too can be successful.

2:19:25.760 --> 2:19:29.180
 I've seen both mindsets win, I've seen both mindsets lose.

2:19:29.180 --> 2:19:31.060
 I've seen every extreme between them.

2:19:31.060 --> 2:19:32.580
 What I generally recommend

2:19:32.580 --> 2:19:36.460
 with regards your mind and preparation going in,

2:19:36.460 --> 2:19:37.980
 find what works for you.

2:19:37.980 --> 2:19:39.260
 Everyone's different.

2:19:39.260 --> 2:19:41.420
 Don't try to give a one size fits all

2:19:41.420 --> 2:19:44.980
 in something as vague and confusing as the human mind.

2:19:47.460 --> 2:19:50.620
 Having said that, my preference,

2:19:50.620 --> 2:19:53.220
 I don't force it on people because everyone's different,

2:19:53.220 --> 2:19:56.540
 but my preference is to try and advocate

2:19:56.540 --> 2:20:00.020
 for a mindset of unexceptionalism.

2:20:00.020 --> 2:20:03.340
 Most people see competition as something exceptional.

2:20:03.340 --> 2:20:05.540
 It's not your everyday grappling session.

2:20:05.540 --> 2:20:08.980
 You train 300 times for every time you compete

2:20:08.980 --> 2:20:11.700
 and so they see competition as something exceptional,

2:20:11.700 --> 2:20:14.260
 different, scarier, more nerve wracking.

2:20:14.260 --> 2:20:16.460
 There's a crowd watching, there's cameras.

2:20:16.460 --> 2:20:17.820
 My reputation is on the line.

2:20:17.820 --> 2:20:20.060
 I'm gonna be observed and judged

2:20:20.060 --> 2:20:22.980
 and so they see it as this exceptional event.

2:20:22.980 --> 2:20:25.060
 My general preference is to see it

2:20:25.060 --> 2:20:28.700
 as an unexceptional event, to see everything else,

2:20:28.700 --> 2:20:33.700
 the noise, the cameras, the crowd as illusions.

2:20:34.140 --> 2:20:36.020
 The only reality is a stage,

2:20:36.020 --> 2:20:37.620
 an opponent on the other side of it

2:20:37.620 --> 2:20:39.820
 and a referee adjudicating you

2:20:39.820 --> 2:20:43.700
 and to make it as unexceptional as possible.

2:20:43.700 --> 2:20:48.540
 Gordon does an extraordinarily good job of doing that.

2:20:48.540 --> 2:20:52.380
 Gordon looks more tense in most of his training sessions

2:20:52.380 --> 2:20:54.060
 than he does in his competitions

2:20:54.060 --> 2:20:55.540
 because he knows his training partners

2:20:55.540 --> 2:20:57.540
 are typically better than the people

2:20:57.540 --> 2:20:59.580
 he's actually going out to compete against.

2:21:01.580 --> 2:21:03.420
 And you see it in his demeanor.

2:21:03.420 --> 2:21:06.100
 It's one of just complete calm.

2:21:06.100 --> 2:21:08.740
 It also goes back to what we talked about earlier

2:21:08.740 --> 2:21:11.180
 about the power of escapes.

2:21:11.180 --> 2:21:13.820
 Gordon Ryan is almost impossible to control

2:21:13.820 --> 2:21:16.260
 for extended periods of time

2:21:16.260 --> 2:21:19.220
 in most of the inferior positions in the sport

2:21:19.220 --> 2:21:21.260
 and most of the submissions.

2:21:21.260 --> 2:21:23.380
 So he goes out in the full knowledge

2:21:23.380 --> 2:21:27.340
 that the worst case scenario isn't that bad for him

2:21:27.340 --> 2:21:29.900
 and so nothing could really go that badly wrong.

2:21:29.900 --> 2:21:32.300
 He can always recover from any given mistake

2:21:32.300 --> 2:21:33.860
 and go on to victory.

2:21:33.860 --> 2:21:35.420
 When you believe those things,

2:21:35.420 --> 2:21:37.660
 you're gonna have a calm demeanor.

2:21:37.660 --> 2:21:41.380
 Then if you look at somebody who is quite a bit different

2:21:41.380 --> 2:21:42.980
 than that, George St. Pierre,

2:21:43.940 --> 2:21:46.740
 who at least in the way he describes it,

2:21:46.740 --> 2:21:50.300
 he's basically exceptionally anxious

2:21:50.300 --> 2:21:53.540
 and terrified approaching a fight

2:21:53.540 --> 2:21:56.060
 and he loves training.

2:21:56.060 --> 2:21:56.980
 And hates fighting.

2:21:56.980 --> 2:21:58.500
 And hates fighting.

2:21:58.500 --> 2:22:02.300
 So and just like you said, he made it work for him.

2:22:02.300 --> 2:22:06.060
 But he's somebody, he speaks very highly of you.

2:22:06.060 --> 2:22:08.860
 He's worked with you quite a bit in training.

2:22:10.580 --> 2:22:11.940
 And you've studied him.

2:22:11.940 --> 2:22:13.580
 You've worked with him.

2:22:13.580 --> 2:22:15.540
 You've coached him.

2:22:15.540 --> 2:22:17.180
 Interesting, I've actually coached George

2:22:17.180 --> 2:22:20.140
 for twice the length of any of the squad members.

2:22:20.140 --> 2:22:23.460
 So my knowledge of him is far greater than it is

2:22:23.460 --> 2:22:26.260
 for the contemporary squad.

2:22:26.260 --> 2:22:29.100
 So can you speak to what makes George St. Pierre,

2:22:29.100 --> 2:22:31.900
 who I think even though I'm Russian

2:22:31.900 --> 2:22:35.460
 and a little bit partial towards Fedor and the Russians,

2:22:35.460 --> 2:22:39.300
 but I think he is in the four categories you mentioned,

2:22:39.300 --> 2:22:43.060
 the greatest mixed martial artist of all time.

2:22:43.060 --> 2:22:44.940
 What makes him so good?

2:22:44.940 --> 2:22:48.300
 His approach, his techniques, his mind.

2:22:48.300 --> 2:22:50.260
 His approach is certainly part of it.

2:22:50.260 --> 2:22:57.020
 George started mixed martial arts at a time when the sport

2:22:57.020 --> 2:23:00.460
 was in a pretty wild phase.

2:23:00.460 --> 2:23:04.700
 It was illegal to show on most American TV networks.

2:23:04.700 --> 2:23:09.940
 And there was talk about it being banned as a sport.

2:23:09.940 --> 2:23:12.340
 In his native Canada, it was banned.

2:23:12.340 --> 2:23:15.700
 You could only fight on Indian reservations in Canada.

2:23:15.700 --> 2:23:17.420
 I believe his first fight may have

2:23:17.420 --> 2:23:20.700
 been on an Indian reservation.

2:23:20.700 --> 2:23:26.260
 So the sport at that stage was very much in its infancy.

2:23:26.260 --> 2:23:28.820
 And it's probably fair to say that most

2:23:28.820 --> 2:23:31.740
 of the athletes involved in the sport

2:23:31.740 --> 2:23:37.860
 came from a training program that would probably

2:23:37.860 --> 2:23:45.620
 describe as unprofessional in the contemporary scene.

2:23:45.620 --> 2:23:48.180
 George is one of a handful of people

2:23:48.180 --> 2:23:50.460
 who started approaching the sport in a truly

2:23:50.460 --> 2:23:51.580
 professional fashion.

2:23:51.580 --> 2:23:53.700
 It was like, OK, here's what great athletes

2:23:53.700 --> 2:23:54.900
 in other sports do.

2:23:54.900 --> 2:23:57.020
 I'm going to try to emulate that.

2:23:57.020 --> 2:24:04.100
 And his ability to invest in himself.

2:24:04.100 --> 2:24:06.100
 In my own experience, for example,

2:24:06.100 --> 2:24:10.140
 George, when I first met him, was a garbage man.

2:24:10.140 --> 2:24:15.180
 And he would jump on a bus from Montreal to New York.

2:24:15.180 --> 2:24:16.860
 Now, that's a long bus ride.

2:24:16.860 --> 2:24:18.700
 He would come down on a Friday afternoon

2:24:18.700 --> 2:24:20.740
 when he finished work as a garbage man,

2:24:20.740 --> 2:24:22.900
 stay for the weekend, and then late on Sunday night,

2:24:22.900 --> 2:24:24.940
 he would jump on a bus all the way back to Montreal

2:24:24.940 --> 2:24:28.340
 and work as a garbage man.

2:24:28.340 --> 2:24:30.980
 That's an extraordinary commitment

2:24:30.980 --> 2:24:34.860
 for a young man to make.

2:24:34.860 --> 2:24:38.660
 And George was a blue belt at the time.

2:24:38.660 --> 2:24:39.660
 And so he would come down.

2:24:39.660 --> 2:24:42.500
 And we had a very talented room.

2:24:42.500 --> 2:24:46.020
 So he didn't do well in the room when he first came in.

2:24:46.020 --> 2:24:47.620
 He was inexperienced in jiu jitsu.

2:24:47.620 --> 2:24:52.540
 And the people who went against were considerably better

2:24:52.540 --> 2:24:53.420
 than him at jiu jitsu.

2:24:53.420 --> 2:24:59.980
 So imagine investing 25% of your weekly income, maybe even more.

2:24:59.980 --> 2:25:03.180
 New York's an expensive town, 50%,

2:25:03.180 --> 2:25:07.700
 to come down and just get your ass kicked month by month.

2:25:07.700 --> 2:25:09.740
 Yeah, that says a lot about who he is.

2:25:09.740 --> 2:25:11.300
 Tells you a lot.

2:25:11.300 --> 2:25:13.380
 First of all, let's talk about the whole idea

2:25:13.380 --> 2:25:14.940
 of delayed gratification here.

2:25:14.940 --> 2:25:17.540
 I mean, that's a guy who's saying,

2:25:17.540 --> 2:25:19.340
 this is highly unpleasant.

2:25:19.340 --> 2:25:22.220
 But I have a vision of myself in the future.

2:25:22.220 --> 2:25:24.860
 And I have to go through this extreme case

2:25:24.860 --> 2:25:27.780
 of delayed gratification to get to that distant goal, which

2:25:27.780 --> 2:25:29.380
 may never happen.

2:25:29.380 --> 2:25:33.300
 And that's a level of commitment and self belief,

2:25:33.300 --> 2:25:35.700
 which is just extraordinary.

2:25:35.700 --> 2:25:38.340
 I always laugh when people say, oh, George was afraid,

2:25:38.340 --> 2:25:41.100
 so he was mentally weak.

2:25:41.100 --> 2:25:45.420
 No, that's a very, very shallow understanding

2:25:45.420 --> 2:25:47.420
 of mental strength and weakness.

2:25:50.020 --> 2:25:53.260
 George felt anxiety.

2:25:53.260 --> 2:25:55.580
 But let's understand from the start,

2:25:55.580 --> 2:25:57.980
 there's different kinds of mental strength.

2:25:57.980 --> 2:26:00.060
 And the most important kind isn't

2:26:00.060 --> 2:26:02.420
 whether you feel fear or don't feel fear

2:26:02.420 --> 2:26:03.860
 before you step into fight.

2:26:03.860 --> 2:26:07.300
 The most important form of mental strength

2:26:07.300 --> 2:26:09.700
 is discipline and training.

2:26:09.700 --> 2:26:11.660
 That's where most people break.

2:26:11.660 --> 2:26:14.980
 I know dozens of people who are fearless to fight,

2:26:14.980 --> 2:26:16.900
 but you couldn't get them to come into the gym

2:26:16.900 --> 2:26:19.900
 for three months in a row and work on skills.

2:26:19.900 --> 2:26:22.700
 So they're mentally strong one way, they don't feel fear.

2:26:22.700 --> 2:26:24.380
 But they're mentally weak in another,

2:26:24.380 --> 2:26:26.980
 which is to instill the discipline which keeps you

2:26:26.980 --> 2:26:29.060
 on a road to progress over time.

2:26:29.060 --> 2:26:31.380
 That's much tougher than not feeling fear

2:26:31.380 --> 2:26:33.180
 before you go out to fight.

2:26:33.180 --> 2:26:36.380
 Understand also that when George talks about fear,

2:26:36.380 --> 2:26:39.180
 he's not afraid of his opponent.

2:26:39.180 --> 2:26:40.100
 He's afraid of failure.

2:26:43.140 --> 2:26:45.780
 He's got high standards.

2:26:45.780 --> 2:26:50.860
 Someone who's got high standards can change the world.

2:26:50.860 --> 2:26:52.820
 His standards were very, very high.

2:26:52.820 --> 2:26:54.180
 That's what he was afraid of.

2:26:54.180 --> 2:26:56.700
 He wasn't afraid of his opponents.

2:26:56.700 --> 2:26:58.980
 And yet, that's always been the misinterpretation.

2:26:58.980 --> 2:26:59.940
 He wasn't mentally weak.

2:26:59.940 --> 2:27:02.540
 He was mentally strong as an ox.

2:27:02.540 --> 2:27:08.380
 To stay in his training regimen year after year after year

2:27:08.380 --> 2:27:10.700
 and do so while he became one of the first stars

2:27:10.700 --> 2:27:13.820
 in mixed martial arts to actually make money.

2:27:13.820 --> 2:27:16.300
 And it gets tough to stay in the training gym

2:27:16.300 --> 2:27:18.060
 with people who are young and hungry

2:27:18.060 --> 2:27:19.740
 and want to punch you in the face.

2:27:19.740 --> 2:27:21.700
 You're coming out of a luxury room,

2:27:21.700 --> 2:27:24.580
 living in finery towards the end of his career

2:27:24.580 --> 2:27:26.060
 and still training as hard as ever.

2:27:26.060 --> 2:27:28.460
 That's an impressive thing.

2:27:28.460 --> 2:27:30.300
 And always he valued perfection.

2:27:30.300 --> 2:27:34.260
 And you're right, the fear was not achieving the perfection.

2:27:34.260 --> 2:27:39.740
 Is there something you've observed

2:27:39.740 --> 2:27:46.260
 about the way he approaches training that stands out to you?

2:27:46.260 --> 2:27:48.020
 Or is it simply the dedication?

2:27:48.020 --> 2:27:49.980
 No, it's never just about dedication.

2:27:49.980 --> 2:27:51.620
 There's lots of dedicated people in the world,

2:27:51.620 --> 2:27:53.020
 but most of them are unsuccessful.

2:27:56.860 --> 2:28:01.900
 If you want to be the best in the world at anything,

2:28:01.900 --> 2:28:06.580
 you have to do, out of the many skills of whatever industry

2:28:06.580 --> 2:28:13.100
 you're in, you have to take at least one of those skills

2:28:13.100 --> 2:28:14.780
 and be the best in the world at it.

2:28:18.140 --> 2:28:21.700
 There's many skills in mixed martial arts.

2:28:21.700 --> 2:28:25.100
 But George identified one skill, which

2:28:25.100 --> 2:28:28.100
 is the skill of striking to take downs.

2:28:28.100 --> 2:28:32.940
 He calls it shootboxing.

2:28:32.940 --> 2:28:37.660
 Shootboxing was barely even a category of skill

2:28:37.660 --> 2:28:38.540
 when George began.

2:28:38.540 --> 2:28:40.900
 It was just the idea that wrestlers grabbed people

2:28:40.900 --> 2:28:44.060
 and took them down the same way they did in wrestling.

2:28:44.060 --> 2:28:48.780
 And you threw some punches before you did it.

2:28:48.780 --> 2:28:56.980
 George largely pioneered the science

2:28:56.980 --> 2:29:02.340
 of creating an interface between striking and take downs.

2:29:02.340 --> 2:29:08.140
 He did it at a time where no one else before him

2:29:08.140 --> 2:29:11.740
 had made it into a system or a science.

2:29:11.740 --> 2:29:14.540
 He did it largely on his own.

2:29:14.540 --> 2:29:20.980
 And I've always said George is the only athlete

2:29:20.980 --> 2:29:25.540
 that I ever coached who taught me more than I taught him.

2:29:25.540 --> 2:29:35.580
 And almost singlehandedly, he created this strong sense

2:29:35.580 --> 2:29:38.700
 of shootboxing as a science, which

2:29:38.700 --> 2:29:41.180
 enabled him throughout his career

2:29:41.180 --> 2:29:44.500
 to determine where the fight would take place.

2:29:44.500 --> 2:29:47.460
 Would it be standing, or would it be on the ground?

2:29:47.460 --> 2:29:49.340
 And that, more than anything else,

2:29:49.340 --> 2:29:51.540
 was the defining characteristic of his success.

2:29:51.540 --> 2:29:55.180
 I will always be immensely impressed

2:29:55.180 --> 2:29:57.220
 by his accomplishment in that regard.

2:29:57.220 --> 2:29:58.300
 He was an innovator.

2:29:58.300 --> 2:30:00.420
 He did things differently.

2:30:00.420 --> 2:30:02.180
 This is such an important point.

2:30:02.180 --> 2:30:05.260
 You can't go out there in combat sports

2:30:05.260 --> 2:30:08.420
 and do the same things that everybody else is doing

2:30:08.420 --> 2:30:11.660
 and expect to get different results.

2:30:11.660 --> 2:30:13.460
 Life doesn't work that way.

2:30:13.460 --> 2:30:15.340
 If you want to be dominant, you've

2:30:15.340 --> 2:30:17.740
 got to find one important part of the sport,

2:30:17.740 --> 2:30:20.740
 and preferably more important than the rest of the sport,

2:30:20.740 --> 2:30:23.980
 and preferably more than one, and be the best in the world

2:30:23.980 --> 2:30:24.580
 at it.

2:30:24.580 --> 2:30:27.700
 You can't be weak at anything, but you can't be strong

2:30:27.700 --> 2:30:28.620
 at everything either.

2:30:28.620 --> 2:30:30.220
 Life's not long enough for us to develop

2:30:30.220 --> 2:30:32.460
 a truly complete skill set.

2:30:32.460 --> 2:30:34.140
 So you've got to be good at everything,

2:30:34.140 --> 2:30:36.620
 and you've got to be the best at at least one thing.

2:30:36.620 --> 2:30:38.780
 And George was the best at two.

2:30:38.780 --> 2:30:43.420
 In his era, he was the best at striking to takedowns,

2:30:43.420 --> 2:30:45.660
 and he was the best at integrating striking

2:30:45.660 --> 2:30:49.260
 and grappling on the floor.

2:30:49.260 --> 2:30:52.300
 Let me ask you a completely ridiculous question,

2:30:52.300 --> 2:30:54.860
 but it's a fascinating one for me

2:30:54.860 --> 2:30:58.500
 from an engineering and a scientific perspective.

2:30:58.500 --> 2:31:02.620
 When I look at a sport, really any problem,

2:31:02.620 --> 2:31:07.860
 one way to ask how difficult is this problem

2:31:07.860 --> 2:31:11.580
 is to see how can I build a machine that competes

2:31:11.580 --> 2:31:13.340
 with a human being at that problem.

2:31:13.340 --> 2:31:14.940
 You can look at chess.

2:31:14.940 --> 2:31:20.180
 You can look at soccer, Robocup,

2:31:20.180 --> 2:31:22.740
 and then you can look at grappling.

2:31:22.740 --> 2:31:25.580
 There's something about when you start to think,

2:31:25.580 --> 2:31:30.140
 how would I build an AI system, a robot that defeats somebody

2:31:30.140 --> 2:31:34.340
 like a Gordon Ryan, where it forces you to really think

2:31:34.340 --> 2:31:41.540
 about formalizing this art as an engineering discipline

2:31:41.540 --> 2:31:45.140
 in the same way you do, but you still have some art

2:31:45.140 --> 2:31:46.540
 injected in there.

2:31:46.540 --> 2:31:48.740
 There's no space for art when you actually have

2:31:48.740 --> 2:31:49.580
 to build the system.

2:31:49.580 --> 2:31:50.940
 That's not a ridiculous question.

2:31:50.940 --> 2:31:52.820
 That's a damn interesting question.

2:31:52.820 --> 2:31:55.740
 Let's put aside, like I mentioned

2:31:55.740 --> 2:31:58.060
 with the Boston Dynamics spot robots,

2:31:58.060 --> 2:32:01.300
 what people don't realize is the amount of power

2:32:01.300 --> 2:32:02.620
 they can deliver is huge.

2:32:02.620 --> 2:32:04.940
 So let's take that weapon aside,

2:32:04.940 --> 2:32:07.540
 just the amount of force you're able to deliver.

2:32:07.540 --> 2:32:10.100
 Yeah, I'm glad you're specifying that.

2:32:10.100 --> 2:32:16.020
 So essentially, your question is, can a talented group

2:32:16.020 --> 2:32:18.940
 of engineers create a robot which could defeat Gordon Ryan?

2:32:18.940 --> 2:32:22.740
 On the face of it, as you just pointed out,

2:32:22.740 --> 2:32:24.580
 that's the easiest project in the world,

2:32:24.580 --> 2:32:27.060
 just create a robot that carries a nine millimeter automatic

2:32:27.060 --> 2:32:28.420
 and shoot them five times in the chest.

2:32:28.420 --> 2:32:30.500
 Okay, that's it, Gordon Ryan's done.

2:32:30.500 --> 2:32:32.300
 So that's not the interesting question.

2:32:32.300 --> 2:32:35.380
 The interesting question, and if I understand you correctly,

2:32:35.380 --> 2:32:41.380
 is if we had the ability to create a robot

2:32:41.380 --> 2:32:45.100
 whose physical powers were identical to Gordon Ryan,

2:32:45.100 --> 2:32:49.380
 not inferior and not superior, what would it take

2:32:49.380 --> 2:32:51.900
 to create a mind inside that robot that would beat

2:32:51.900 --> 2:32:53.580
 Gordon Ryan in the majority of matches?

2:32:53.580 --> 2:32:56.780
 Yeah, and there's two ways to build AI systems.

2:32:56.780 --> 2:33:00.380
 This is true for autonomous driving, for example,

2:33:00.380 --> 2:33:03.300
 which has been quite contested recently.

2:33:03.300 --> 2:33:06.100
 So one is you basically, one way to describe it

2:33:06.100 --> 2:33:09.220
 is you have a giant set of rules.

2:33:09.220 --> 2:33:12.260
 It's like this tree of rules where you apply

2:33:12.260 --> 2:33:14.340
 in different condition when there's a pattern you see,

2:33:14.340 --> 2:33:17.180
 you apply a rule and they're hard coded in.

2:33:17.180 --> 2:33:20.460
 You basically get like a John Donr type of character

2:33:20.460 --> 2:33:26.460
 who tries to encode, hard code into the system,

2:33:26.460 --> 2:33:29.660
 all the moves you should do in every single case.

2:33:29.660 --> 2:33:32.420
 Of course, you can't actually do that fully.

2:33:32.420 --> 2:33:34.980
 So you're going to be taking shortcuts,

2:33:34.980 --> 2:33:36.820
 what are called heuristics,

2:33:36.820 --> 2:33:41.020
 just a basic kind of generalizations

2:33:41.020 --> 2:33:44.980
 and apply your own expertise as an expert of,

2:33:44.980 --> 2:33:47.020
 in this case, grappling,

2:33:47.020 --> 2:33:49.060
 to see how that can be coded as a rule.

2:33:49.060 --> 2:33:50.780
 Now, the other approach,

2:33:50.780 --> 2:33:53.220
 Elon Musk and Tesla are taking this approach,

2:33:53.220 --> 2:33:55.420
 which is called machine learning,

2:33:55.420 --> 2:34:01.820
 which is create a basic framework

2:34:01.820 --> 2:34:05.180
 of the kind of things you should be observing

2:34:05.180 --> 2:34:09.620
 and what are the measures, metrics of success,

2:34:09.620 --> 2:34:13.820
 and then just observe and see which things lead to success,

2:34:13.820 --> 2:34:16.100
 more success and which lead to less success.

2:34:16.100 --> 2:34:17.900
 And there's a delta.

2:34:17.900 --> 2:34:20.580
 Like when you see a thing,

2:34:20.580 --> 2:34:22.500
 first of all, the way machine learning works

2:34:22.500 --> 2:34:26.740
 is you predict, you see a position or you see a situation

2:34:26.740 --> 2:34:28.860
 and then you predict how good that is

2:34:28.860 --> 2:34:31.180
 and then you watch how it actually turns out

2:34:31.180 --> 2:34:34.940
 and if it's worse or better, you adjust your expectations.

2:34:34.940 --> 2:34:39.900
 And through that process, you can learn quite a lot.

2:34:39.900 --> 2:34:43.020
 The challenge is,

2:34:43.020 --> 2:34:46.740
 and this might be a very true challenge in grappling,

2:34:46.740 --> 2:34:52.900
 is like in driving, you can't crash.

2:34:52.900 --> 2:34:55.500
 So there's a physical world.

2:34:55.500 --> 2:34:56.940
 In chess, for example,

2:34:56.940 --> 2:35:00.860
 where this approach has been exceptionally successful,

2:35:00.860 --> 2:35:02.540
 you can work in simulation.

2:35:02.540 --> 2:35:07.660
 So you can have AI system that, for example,

2:35:07.660 --> 2:35:10.180
 as in the case with AlphaZero by DeepMind,

2:35:10.180 --> 2:35:11.780
 Google's DeepMind,

2:35:11.780 --> 2:35:14.940
 it can play itself in simulation millions of times,

2:35:14.940 --> 2:35:16.900
 billions of times.

2:35:16.900 --> 2:35:19.980
 It's difficult to know if it's possible to do that

2:35:19.980 --> 2:35:25.220
 in simulation for anything that involves human movement,

2:35:25.220 --> 2:35:28.260
 like grappling.

2:35:28.260 --> 2:35:31.620
 So that's, my sense is,

2:35:31.620 --> 2:35:34.660
 if we first look at the hard encoding,

2:35:34.660 --> 2:35:39.420
 if you were to try to describe Gordon Ryan to a machine,

2:35:39.420 --> 2:35:41.340
 how many rules are in there, do you think?

2:35:41.340 --> 2:35:43.980
 Yeah, first off, let me tell you,

2:35:43.980 --> 2:35:45.540
 that's one of the most fascinating questions

2:35:45.540 --> 2:35:46.380
 I've ever been asked.

2:35:46.380 --> 2:35:50.100
 And I'm tremendously happy to answer this.

2:35:51.220 --> 2:35:52.780
 How about what we do is,

2:35:52.780 --> 2:35:55.340
 this is a massive question you've asked.

2:35:55.340 --> 2:35:56.780
 There's a huge amount of ways

2:35:56.780 --> 2:35:59.380
 this could get very interesting and very confusing.

2:35:59.380 --> 2:36:03.060
 Let's set some ground rules for the discussion.

2:36:04.780 --> 2:36:11.220
 Lex alluded to the idea of man versus machine and chess.

2:36:11.220 --> 2:36:12.740
 Okay, and I think that's a really good place

2:36:12.740 --> 2:36:14.940
 for us to start the discussion.

2:36:16.700 --> 2:36:20.100
 I'm gonna just tell people about a little bit,

2:36:20.100 --> 2:36:22.060
 the history of man versus chess,

2:36:22.060 --> 2:36:25.380
 to give you guys some background on this.

2:36:25.380 --> 2:36:29.500
 In 1968, there was a party in which a highly ranked,

2:36:29.500 --> 2:36:31.860
 not a world champion, but a highly ranked chess player,

2:36:31.860 --> 2:36:33.180
 his name was Levy,

2:36:33.180 --> 2:36:40.300
 and he met a computer engineer at a party,

2:36:40.300 --> 2:36:45.620
 and they had a lighthearted bet

2:36:45.620 --> 2:36:48.380
 that in a 10 year timeframe,

2:36:48.380 --> 2:36:53.860
 a human chess player would be defeated by a computer.

2:36:53.860 --> 2:36:55.420
 Now, you gotta remember, 1968,

2:36:55.420 --> 2:36:57.580
 computing power was very, very low.

2:36:57.580 --> 2:36:59.940
 The computers that got America to the moon

2:36:59.940 --> 2:37:02.780
 were actually pretty damn primitive.

2:37:02.780 --> 2:37:06.140
 Your iPhone would kick all of their asses.

2:37:06.140 --> 2:37:09.340
 So computational power was very, very low in those days.

2:37:09.340 --> 2:37:12.740
 So interestingly, the chess player fully believed

2:37:12.740 --> 2:37:15.300
 that no computer could beat him in the 10 year timeframe,

2:37:15.300 --> 2:37:18.500
 and the computer engineer was very optimistic

2:37:18.500 --> 2:37:20.820
 that he was wrong, and in fact,

2:37:20.820 --> 2:37:24.220
 10 years, the computer would win.

2:37:24.220 --> 2:37:26.180
 10 years later, they had a competition,

2:37:26.180 --> 2:37:29.580
 and the human won, decisively, in fact.

2:37:29.580 --> 2:37:35.340
 So computational power simply hadn't risen to that level yet.

2:37:35.340 --> 2:37:38.700
 Through the 1980s, computational power increased,

2:37:38.700 --> 2:37:43.860
 but not sufficient to get to championship level.

2:37:43.860 --> 2:37:45.780
 There were computer programs in the 1980s

2:37:45.780 --> 2:37:49.700
 which were competitive with good, solid chess players,

2:37:49.700 --> 2:37:54.700
 but not world beaters.

2:37:54.700 --> 2:37:57.660
 Understand right from the start

2:37:57.660 --> 2:38:00.540
 that there's a fundamental problem here.

2:38:00.540 --> 2:38:06.580
 The number of options that the two players in a chessboard

2:38:06.580 --> 2:38:11.380
 can run through is astronomically high.

2:38:11.380 --> 2:38:14.380
 There are 64 squares on a chessboard.

2:38:14.380 --> 2:38:18.860
 The number of possible options that could work

2:38:18.860 --> 2:38:22.340
 or could play out on a chessboard,

2:38:22.340 --> 2:38:26.020
 and this is a truly shocking thing for you to think about,

2:38:26.020 --> 2:38:29.380
 the number of possible options is higher

2:38:29.380 --> 2:38:34.860
 than the number of atoms in the known universe.

2:38:34.860 --> 2:38:38.500
 Think about that for a second in terms of complexity, okay?

2:38:38.500 --> 2:38:44.900
 The number of atoms on this table is massive, okay?

2:38:44.900 --> 2:38:48.780
 That is an unbelievably large number.

2:38:48.780 --> 2:38:51.180
 We're talking about a situation where if a computer

2:38:51.180 --> 2:38:53.900
 had to go through all the options at the onset of a match,

2:38:53.900 --> 2:38:57.300
 they would have to run numbers greater

2:38:57.300 --> 2:39:00.460
 than the number of atoms in the known universe.

2:39:00.460 --> 2:39:05.500
 The number of galaxies in our universe is vast, okay?

2:39:05.500 --> 2:39:06.860
 It's measured in the billions.

2:39:06.860 --> 2:39:08.020
 Like, the number of atoms,

2:39:08.020 --> 2:39:12.100
 that's just a number so mind blowing it's impossible, okay?

2:39:12.100 --> 2:39:17.420
 So no computer is ever going to be able to work

2:39:17.420 --> 2:39:19.740
 with those kinds of numbers, okay?

2:39:19.740 --> 2:39:22.620
 I didn't even know future generations of quantum computers

2:39:22.620 --> 2:39:24.420
 could work with those kinds of numbers.

2:39:24.420 --> 2:39:26.340
 So that's the fundamental problem, okay?

2:39:26.340 --> 2:39:28.700
 The number of options in a chess match

2:39:28.700 --> 2:39:31.580
 is just so astronomically large

2:39:31.580 --> 2:39:34.700
 that no computer could ever figure out

2:39:34.700 --> 2:39:36.220
 all the available options

2:39:36.220 --> 2:39:37.940
 and make decisions in a given timeframe.

2:39:37.940 --> 2:39:40.100
 So that's the fundamental problem.

2:39:40.100 --> 2:39:43.540
 So as Lex correctly pointed out,

2:39:43.540 --> 2:39:46.580
 the way you get around this is by the use of heuristics.

2:39:46.580 --> 2:39:48.780
 These are rules of thumb,

2:39:48.780 --> 2:39:51.740
 which give general guidelines to action.

2:39:51.740 --> 2:39:53.020
 So for example, in jiu jitsu,

2:39:53.020 --> 2:39:55.660
 I could give you a general rule of thumb.

2:39:55.660 --> 2:39:57.980
 Don't turn your back on your opponent, okay?

2:39:57.980 --> 2:39:59.300
 That's a solid piece of advice.

2:39:59.300 --> 2:40:01.340
 There are obviously some exceptions to that rule,

2:40:01.340 --> 2:40:04.060
 but it's a good solid piece of advice to give a beginner.

2:40:04.060 --> 2:40:06.580
 The moment you give that heuristic rule,

2:40:06.580 --> 2:40:09.300
 you rule out a lot of options, okay?

2:40:09.300 --> 2:40:11.380
 You've already told someone don't turn your back,

2:40:11.380 --> 2:40:12.580
 don't turn your back on someone.

2:40:12.580 --> 2:40:14.100
 So a lot of possibilities

2:40:14.100 --> 2:40:16.300
 have just been turned away right there.

2:40:16.300 --> 2:40:18.660
 So you've cut the number of options in half right there

2:40:18.660 --> 2:40:21.220
 just by giving one heuristic rule, okay?

2:40:22.460 --> 2:40:26.700
 If you were decent at chess, not great, but decent,

2:40:26.700 --> 2:40:30.580
 and you knew enough to give say 10 heuristic rules,

2:40:30.580 --> 2:40:34.540
 you could chop that initially vast number of options down

2:40:34.540 --> 2:40:36.260
 by a vast amount.

2:40:36.260 --> 2:40:38.260
 And now you're starting to get to a point

2:40:38.260 --> 2:40:41.900
 where if a computer had sufficient computational power,

2:40:41.900 --> 2:40:45.020
 it could start getting through the number of options

2:40:45.020 --> 2:40:46.660
 in that acceptable timeframe.

2:40:46.660 --> 2:40:50.460
 So that's the general pattern of the development.

2:40:50.460 --> 2:40:52.260
 Now, things started getting very interesting

2:40:52.260 --> 2:40:56.580
 in the mid 1990s with IBM's computer Deep Blue.

2:40:58.660 --> 2:41:01.420
 There was a great chess champion of the late 1980s

2:41:01.420 --> 2:41:05.340
 and early through the 1990s called Gary Kasparov,

2:41:05.340 --> 2:41:08.900
 who had been more or less undefeated for a decade.

2:41:08.900 --> 2:41:12.220
 In 1996, he took on IBM's computer Deep Blue.

2:41:12.220 --> 2:41:16.340
 Just to correct the record, he was undefeated.

2:41:18.460 --> 2:41:20.420
 I apologize, Russian, gotta make sure.

2:41:20.420 --> 2:41:21.980
 They get very nationalistic about their chess.

2:41:21.980 --> 2:41:23.380
 Be careful of these guys.

2:41:23.380 --> 2:41:26.940
 Deep Blue lost the first confrontation, I believe, in 1996.

2:41:26.940 --> 2:41:28.660
 It was competitive, but lost.

2:41:28.660 --> 2:41:32.980
 Then in 1997, Deep Blue won.

2:41:32.980 --> 2:41:35.620
 And it wasn't a complete walkover.

2:41:35.620 --> 2:41:38.060
 Kasparov, I believe, won one of the matches.

2:41:38.060 --> 2:41:43.060
 But they did, Deep Blue unequivocally won the confrontation.

2:41:43.380 --> 2:41:45.660
 And it was seen as like this watershed moment

2:41:45.660 --> 2:41:49.900
 where a computer beat the best human chess player

2:41:49.900 --> 2:41:52.340
 on the planet, and that was it.

2:41:52.340 --> 2:41:54.580
 There's no coming back from that.

2:41:54.580 --> 2:41:57.540
 I think it would be remembered as one of the biggest moments

2:41:57.540 --> 2:42:00.900
 in computing history, is really when the first time

2:42:00.900 --> 2:42:02.500
 a machine beat a human at a thing

2:42:02.500 --> 2:42:04.100
 that humans really care about

2:42:04.100 --> 2:42:06.580
 in the domain of intellectual pursuits.

2:42:06.580 --> 2:42:10.340
 Yeah, it was a powerful, powerful moment.

2:42:10.340 --> 2:42:13.620
 Now, not only was that a powerful moment,

2:42:13.620 --> 2:42:15.740
 but things started getting truly interesting

2:42:15.740 --> 2:42:17.140
 from that moment forward,

2:42:17.140 --> 2:42:18.020
 because then you started having

2:42:18.020 --> 2:42:19.980
 different areas of development.

2:42:25.860 --> 2:42:30.780
 The general way in which the progress is made

2:42:30.780 --> 2:42:32.980
 from those early starts in 1968,

2:42:32.980 --> 2:42:36.900
 all the way through to Deep Blue's victory,

2:42:36.900 --> 2:42:39.420
 was of the use of heuristic rules

2:42:39.420 --> 2:42:42.660
 that brought down the number of potential options

2:42:42.660 --> 2:42:44.300
 to a manageable level.

2:42:44.300 --> 2:42:46.380
 As computer power increased,

2:42:46.380 --> 2:42:48.340
 then it could make faster and faster

2:42:48.340 --> 2:42:50.220
 and wiser and wiser decisions,

2:42:50.220 --> 2:42:52.740
 and make them at a rate which no human,

2:42:52.740 --> 2:42:54.500
 even the best human, could keep up with.

2:42:54.500 --> 2:42:58.540
 So that was the general way in which the debate went.

2:42:58.540 --> 2:43:01.460
 But things got more interesting after this,

2:43:01.460 --> 2:43:06.460
 with the advent of computers that, as you pointed out,

2:43:06.460 --> 2:43:08.780
 make use of so called machine learning.

2:43:10.940 --> 2:43:15.940
 There were, a company put out a program, AlphaZero,

2:43:18.260 --> 2:43:23.260
 which can look at the basic rule structures of chess,

2:43:23.900 --> 2:43:27.100
 and then ultimately play itself in trials,

2:43:27.100 --> 2:43:28.900
 and make trial and error assessment

2:43:28.900 --> 2:43:30.900
 of what are good and bad strategies,

2:43:30.900 --> 2:43:33.140
 so that with no human intervention,

2:43:34.100 --> 2:43:36.700
 a computer could start doing remarkable things.

2:43:38.780 --> 2:43:43.780
 Not only did this company create AlphaZero,

2:43:44.340 --> 2:43:45.940
 and there were some other ones too,

2:43:45.940 --> 2:43:47.380
 they fought not only in chess,

2:43:47.380 --> 2:43:51.660
 but in the much more complex Asian game of Go,

2:43:51.660 --> 2:43:55.220
 which has far more potential options

2:43:55.220 --> 2:43:58.060
 than chess does, by a very significant margin.

2:44:00.060 --> 2:44:02.420
 These machine learning programs,

2:44:02.420 --> 2:44:05.900
 not only easily defeat any human in chess,

2:44:05.900 --> 2:44:07.620
 but in Go as well.

2:44:08.780 --> 2:44:10.500
 And what's truly remarkable

2:44:10.500 --> 2:44:12.300
 is they weren't just beating them.

2:44:13.180 --> 2:44:16.420
 When AlphaZero took on a rival chess program,

2:44:16.420 --> 2:44:19.260
 which by itself was already superior to any human,

2:44:19.260 --> 2:44:23.940
 it only required four hours,

2:44:23.940 --> 2:44:26.780
 starting from learning the rules of chess,

2:44:26.780 --> 2:44:28.740
 to figuring out how to beat

2:44:28.740 --> 2:44:31.780
 the second most powerful chess program in the world.

2:44:31.780 --> 2:44:34.020
 That's insane.

2:44:34.020 --> 2:44:36.380
 That's literally like taking a human,

2:44:36.380 --> 2:44:38.020
 telling the rules of chess,

2:44:38.020 --> 2:44:41.180
 they play some games with themselves for four hours,

2:44:41.180 --> 2:44:42.980
 and they go out and beat Garry Kasparov.

2:44:44.980 --> 2:44:46.780
 This is, I don't know,

2:44:46.780 --> 2:44:51.780
 this is, to me, this is a truly exciting development,

2:44:53.620 --> 2:44:55.540
 far beyond even what Deep Blue did.

2:44:55.540 --> 2:44:57.700
 I like how you said exciting, not terrifying,

2:44:57.700 --> 2:44:59.860
 because I agree with you on the exciting.

2:44:59.860 --> 2:45:03.460
 Now, things also get exciting in a different direction.

2:45:03.460 --> 2:45:05.620
 There is another possibility,

2:45:05.620 --> 2:45:10.060
 which few people foresaw after the Deep Blue episode.

2:45:10.060 --> 2:45:14.060
 This is where a new form of chess started to emerge,

2:45:14.060 --> 2:45:17.260
 sometimes called cyborg chess or centaur chess,

2:45:18.860 --> 2:45:23.340
 where humans of moderate chess level playing ability,

2:45:23.340 --> 2:45:27.020
 not world champions, just decent, but not great,

2:45:27.020 --> 2:45:30.220
 I guess you might say like purple belts in jiu jitsu,

2:45:30.220 --> 2:45:33.460
 allied themselves with computers.

2:45:33.460 --> 2:45:37.500
 So the humans and computers worked as a cyborg team.

2:45:38.820 --> 2:45:43.020
 The humans supplied the heuristic insight.

2:45:43.020 --> 2:45:46.020
 The computers supplied the computational power.

2:45:46.900 --> 2:45:51.540
 And fascinatingly, they proved to be superior

2:45:51.540 --> 2:45:55.020
 to both the best humans and the best chess programs.

2:45:56.620 --> 2:46:01.020
 The united force of human insight with heuristics,

2:46:01.020 --> 2:46:04.340
 with computers ability to go through numbers

2:46:04.340 --> 2:46:08.020
 in far more rapid form than any human could ever hope to do,

2:46:08.020 --> 2:46:10.300
 proved to be one of the strongest combinations

2:46:10.300 --> 2:46:15.300
 and enabled that pairing of human and computer

2:46:15.620 --> 2:46:18.780
 to overwhelm both the best single human

2:46:18.780 --> 2:46:21.660
 and the best single computer.

2:46:21.660 --> 2:46:26.580
 That adds a whole new level of fascination to this topic.

2:46:26.580 --> 2:46:29.180
 So to wind things up here,

2:46:29.180 --> 2:46:33.740
 we've got this fascinating initial question from Lex,

2:46:33.740 --> 2:46:38.740
 the idea of could there be a computer inside a robot

2:46:38.740 --> 2:46:42.860
 which doesn't have any special physical properties?

2:46:42.860 --> 2:46:44.900
 This is mind versus mind

2:46:44.900 --> 2:46:46.220
 because the bodies negate each other.

2:46:46.220 --> 2:46:48.780
 The robot is the same body as Gordon Ryan.

2:46:48.780 --> 2:46:50.420
 This is a thought experiment.

2:46:50.420 --> 2:46:53.500
 What would it take to create a mind

2:46:53.500 --> 2:46:56.300
 that would defeat the mind of Gordon Ryan?

2:46:58.980 --> 2:47:00.940
 Based on the chess example,

2:47:02.020 --> 2:47:04.820
 it would appear that this is entirely feasible

2:47:04.820 --> 2:47:06.060
 at some point in the future.

2:47:06.060 --> 2:47:07.420
 And in fact, I would go further and say,

2:47:07.420 --> 2:47:09.220
 it's actually quite likely

2:47:09.220 --> 2:47:13.500
 based on what we've seen from the example of chess.

2:47:13.500 --> 2:47:18.020
 The rate of progress in AI in the last 20 years

2:47:19.540 --> 2:47:23.380
 has dwarfed anything from the previous 50 years.

2:47:24.500 --> 2:47:27.380
 And the rate continues to increase.

2:47:28.940 --> 2:47:31.900
 We're talking now at a level where the machine learning

2:47:31.900 --> 2:47:37.860
 of defeating world champions in chess and Go in four hours,

2:47:37.860 --> 2:47:41.380
 like just from starting from the rules of the sport,

2:47:44.340 --> 2:47:47.500
 this is gonna be difficult for humans to keep up with.

2:47:47.500 --> 2:47:52.100
 Now in humans favor, could we take Gordon Ryan

2:47:52.100 --> 2:47:54.700
 and put a chip inside his brain

2:47:54.700 --> 2:47:56.620
 that created the same cyborg effect

2:47:56.620 --> 2:47:59.380
 as we saw in centaur chess and cyborg chess,

2:47:59.380 --> 2:48:01.700
 and then take Gordon Ryan to a new level

2:48:01.700 --> 2:48:03.820
 and suddenly his computational powers

2:48:03.820 --> 2:48:05.300
 were massively increased.

2:48:05.300 --> 2:48:08.260
 He still has his heuristic insight,

2:48:08.260 --> 2:48:11.980
 but he has vastly augmented computational powers.

2:48:11.980 --> 2:48:13.740
 That's the interesting battle.

2:48:15.540 --> 2:48:16.900
 You asked a great question, Lex.

2:48:16.900 --> 2:48:19.860
 Let me give you my initial push for an answer

2:48:19.860 --> 2:48:22.700
 would be that if it's just Gordon Ryan

2:48:22.700 --> 2:48:27.060
 versus your robot technology,

2:48:27.060 --> 2:48:29.500
 in 10 years, I would say with machine learning,

2:48:29.500 --> 2:48:31.900
 I'd say you guys win every time.

2:48:31.900 --> 2:48:36.220
 But if it is cyborg Gordon Ryan,

2:48:36.220 --> 2:48:40.660
 where he's part Gordon Ryan with heuristics

2:48:40.660 --> 2:48:43.780
 and part machine, then, and now that's where I throw

2:48:43.780 --> 2:48:48.140
 the question back at you, young man, what do you think?

2:48:48.140 --> 2:48:49.660
 Well, I'm fascinated to hear your answer.

2:48:49.660 --> 2:48:52.220
 That's very interesting because there's a lot

2:48:52.220 --> 2:48:55.100
 of different ways you can build a cyborg Gordon Ryan.

2:48:55.100 --> 2:48:58.260
 So one is there's the Neuralink way,

2:48:58.260 --> 2:49:03.260
 which is basically doing what you're suggesting,

2:49:03.980 --> 2:49:06.980
 which is expanding the computational capabilities

2:49:06.980 --> 2:49:08.260
 of Gordon Ryan's brain,

2:49:09.820 --> 2:49:11.660
 like directly being able to communicate

2:49:11.660 --> 2:49:13.540
 between a computer and the brain.

2:49:13.540 --> 2:49:18.540
 So you preserve most of what there is in the human body,

2:49:20.060 --> 2:49:22.620
 including the nervous system and the computing system

2:49:22.620 --> 2:49:24.380
 we currently have that's biological

2:49:24.380 --> 2:49:26.420
 and expanding over the computer.

2:49:26.420 --> 2:49:28.780
 There's also on the cyborg chess front,

2:49:30.780 --> 2:49:35.220
 like Magnus Carlsen, the current world champion in chess,

2:49:35.220 --> 2:49:38.620
 he studies AlphaZero games.

2:49:38.620 --> 2:49:42.220
 Like it's not a regular thing for high level grandmasters.

2:49:42.220 --> 2:49:45.580
 From what I understand, almost every chess master

2:49:45.580 --> 2:49:48.700
 now studies computer games for inspiration.

2:49:48.700 --> 2:49:53.700
 Like just as great chess players from the past

2:49:53.700 --> 2:49:56.780
 used to go back into old leather bound books

2:49:56.780 --> 2:50:00.100
 of previous grandmasters and study games and books.

2:50:00.100 --> 2:50:03.360
 Nowadays, most people, when they wanna study

2:50:03.360 --> 2:50:04.340
 the most perfect games,

2:50:04.340 --> 2:50:06.860
 they actually study programs like AlphaZero.

2:50:06.860 --> 2:50:09.980
 Yeah, and it's not just for inspiration, it's education.

2:50:09.980 --> 2:50:12.340
 I mean, it's literally part of their training regimen.

2:50:12.340 --> 2:50:14.820
 This isn't like a fun side thing.

2:50:14.820 --> 2:50:17.300
 This is the main way to get better.

2:50:18.180 --> 2:50:21.380
 So there's a certain element there

2:50:21.380 --> 2:50:24.420
 where even our human brains can be trained

2:50:24.420 --> 2:50:29.020
 by observing the partial explorations

2:50:29.020 --> 2:50:32.180
 of an AI systems in the space of grappling.

2:50:32.180 --> 2:50:34.260
 That could be actually in simulation.

2:50:34.260 --> 2:50:35.660
 It doesn't have to be in the physical world.

2:50:35.660 --> 2:50:40.660
 It could be in, if we construct sufficiently good

2:50:41.220 --> 2:50:43.940
 biomechanical models of human beings,

2:50:43.940 --> 2:50:46.260
 machines can learn how they grapple.

2:50:46.260 --> 2:50:49.580
 There's quite a bit of that already.

2:50:49.580 --> 2:50:53.300
 OpenAI has the system of, they're like sumo wrestlers

2:50:53.300 --> 2:50:58.060
 with some basic goals of pushing each other off of a platform.

2:50:58.060 --> 2:51:01.060
 And you know nothing from the, you don't even know.

2:51:01.060 --> 2:51:04.700
 So you have a basic model of a bipedal system.

2:51:04.700 --> 2:51:07.020
 It doesn't even know in the beginning how to stand up.

2:51:07.020 --> 2:51:08.620
 It just falls, right?

2:51:08.620 --> 2:51:10.940
 So it has to learn how to get up

2:51:10.940 --> 2:51:13.080
 and they do that through self play.

2:51:13.080 --> 2:51:15.980
 They learn how to get up, they learn how to move

2:51:15.980 --> 2:51:18.220
 enough to achieve the final goal

2:51:18.220 --> 2:51:20.420
 which is to push your opponent off of the thing.

2:51:20.420 --> 2:51:22.700
 So they learn that.

2:51:22.700 --> 2:51:26.540
 Now OpenAI is not, those folks are currently

2:51:26.540 --> 2:51:28.580
 not that interested in the grappling world.

2:51:28.580 --> 2:51:30.260
 So they kind of stop there.

2:51:30.260 --> 2:51:35.260
 But it's very possible in simulation to then develop ideas.

2:51:36.120 --> 2:51:38.940
 In fact, this is something that I should probably do,

2:51:38.940 --> 2:51:41.260
 but it's pretty natural to do it easy,

2:51:41.260 --> 2:51:45.100
 is ideas of control and submission and all the,

2:51:45.100 --> 2:51:49.820
 you add the ability to, I don't know how to put it nicely,

2:51:49.820 --> 2:51:54.060
 but to choke your opponent

2:51:54.060 --> 2:51:57.980
 and to break their body parts off,

2:51:57.980 --> 2:52:00.140
 which is what jiu jitsu is.

2:52:00.140 --> 2:52:03.980
 Add that in and what kind of ideas it'll come up with

2:52:03.980 --> 2:52:05.580
 is very fascinating.

2:52:05.580 --> 2:52:07.380
 I actually don't know, until this conversation,

2:52:07.380 --> 2:52:08.860
 I don't know why I never even thought about that.

2:52:08.860 --> 2:52:11.020
 I've been very obsessed with just like walking

2:52:11.020 --> 2:52:13.860
 and running and all those kinds of things,

2:52:13.860 --> 2:52:16.300
 like evolving different strategies

2:52:16.300 --> 2:52:18.820
 for when you have a bunch of,

2:52:18.820 --> 2:52:21.180
 so one difficult thing for robots

2:52:21.180 --> 2:52:22.660
 is when you have uneven terrain

2:52:22.660 --> 2:52:24.180
 and there's uncertainty about the terrain

2:52:24.180 --> 2:52:25.780
 is how to keep walking.

2:52:25.780 --> 2:52:28.980
 Or when there's a bunch of things being thrown at you,

2:52:28.980 --> 2:52:29.940
 all that kind of stuff,

2:52:29.940 --> 2:52:32.900
 and you learn through self play

2:52:32.900 --> 2:52:35.220
 how to be able to navigate those uncertain environments

2:52:35.220 --> 2:52:36.980
 when there's a lot of weird objects

2:52:36.980 --> 2:52:38.500
 and all those kinds of things.

2:52:38.500 --> 2:52:40.340
 There's no reason why you can't just do that

2:52:40.340 --> 2:52:43.420
 with submissions and so on in simulation.

2:52:43.420 --> 2:52:44.860
 That'll be actually fascinating.

2:52:44.860 --> 2:52:49.020
 But once we might be surprised

2:52:49.020 --> 2:52:52.260
 by the kind of strategies in simulation

2:52:52.260 --> 2:52:54.620
 these AI systems will develop,

2:52:54.620 --> 2:52:57.020
 and that might make a much better Gordon Ryan

2:52:57.020 --> 2:52:58.740
 and much better John Donahar

2:52:58.740 --> 2:53:01.840
 in asking the Dean Lister question of like,

2:53:01.840 --> 2:53:03.760
 why are we only using,

2:53:03.760 --> 2:53:06.260
 why are we not doing X?

2:53:06.260 --> 2:53:10.340
 But on the actual sort of grappling event

2:53:10.340 --> 2:53:12.620
 in the physical space,

2:53:12.620 --> 2:53:15.540
 I've been very surprised and a little bit disappointed

2:53:15.540 --> 2:53:18.460
 by how difficult it's to build

2:53:20.880 --> 2:53:25.880
 a system that's able to have the body of Gordon Ryan

2:53:26.380 --> 2:53:28.000
 or a human being actually,

2:53:28.900 --> 2:53:31.820
 which means it's not just the biomechanics

2:53:31.820 --> 2:53:33.660
 which is very difficult to do,

2:53:33.660 --> 2:53:37.840
 but also all of the senses that are involved.

2:53:37.840 --> 2:53:40.340
 Be able to perceive the world as richly,

2:53:40.340 --> 2:53:43.660
 to be able to, there's something called soft robotics,

2:53:43.660 --> 2:53:47.620
 which is incredibly difficult to do through touch,

2:53:47.620 --> 2:53:50.060
 understand the hardness of things.

2:53:50.060 --> 2:53:52.780
 We don't understand as human beings

2:53:52.780 --> 2:53:56.220
 just how much we're able through touch

2:53:56.220 --> 2:53:59.480
 to experience the world and to manipulate the world.

2:53:59.480 --> 2:54:02.180
 Like the process of picking up a cup

2:54:03.180 --> 2:54:05.220
 is very similar to the process of grappling.

2:54:05.220 --> 2:54:07.160
 All the feeling that you do,

2:54:07.160 --> 2:54:09.340
 all the leverage that you're applying,

2:54:09.340 --> 2:54:11.400
 there's so many degrees of freedom

2:54:11.400 --> 2:54:14.580
 in both the, in the interactive sense,

2:54:14.580 --> 2:54:16.140
 in the sensing and the applying,

2:54:16.140 --> 2:54:17.060
 sensing and applying,

2:54:17.060 --> 2:54:20.420
 you're doing that through so much of your body,

2:54:20.420 --> 2:54:23.620
 that it's just going to be very difficult

2:54:23.620 --> 2:54:26.660
 to build a system that's able to experience the world

2:54:26.660 --> 2:54:30.180
 and act onto the world as richly as we humans can.

2:54:30.180 --> 2:54:33.060
 Yeah, if picking up a cup

2:54:33.060 --> 2:54:36.180
 is a seemingly insurmountable challenge,

2:54:36.180 --> 2:54:39.020
 then taking someone down, controlling them,

2:54:39.020 --> 2:54:40.020
 getting past their legs,

2:54:40.020 --> 2:54:42.660
 that's going to be one hell of a project.

2:54:42.660 --> 2:54:44.980
 Exactly, I mean, there could be shortcuts,

2:54:44.980 --> 2:54:49.460
 but I mean, currently that's the field

2:54:49.460 --> 2:54:52.820
 called robotic manipulation, which is picking up objects.

2:54:52.820 --> 2:54:55.660
 Usually they have like a ball and a triangular object

2:54:55.660 --> 2:54:57.620
 and your whole task is to like pick it up

2:54:57.620 --> 2:54:59.600
 and move it around.

2:54:59.600 --> 2:55:04.420
 Generalizing that to the human body is harder,

2:55:04.420 --> 2:55:09.060
 but perhaps not as hard as we might think.

2:55:09.060 --> 2:55:11.480
 The question is, how do you construct experiments

2:55:11.480 --> 2:55:13.420
 where you can do that safely?

2:55:13.420 --> 2:55:15.340
 In chess, that's very easy,

2:55:15.340 --> 2:55:18.720
 but here it's very, very problematic.

2:55:22.420 --> 2:55:24.780
 I guess you could just have robot versus robot

2:55:25.860 --> 2:55:27.540
 teamed up with each other and then they learn

2:55:27.540 --> 2:55:29.460
 and then they go out to take on a human opponent.

2:55:29.460 --> 2:55:33.260
 Yes, exactly, so you have two physical robots

2:55:33.260 --> 2:55:35.340
 that interact with each other.

2:55:35.340 --> 2:55:37.100
 Everything you've said so far suggests

2:55:37.100 --> 2:55:40.420
 that many of the problems, these tactile elements,

2:55:40.420 --> 2:55:43.580
 they're easy tasks for humans.

2:55:43.580 --> 2:55:46.260
 So which becomes more powerful more quickly?

2:55:47.160 --> 2:55:49.580
 Robots that are taught to think like humans

2:55:49.580 --> 2:55:52.460
 or humans that are given the computational power

2:55:52.460 --> 2:55:56.980
 of computers and robots themselves,

2:55:56.980 --> 2:55:59.960
 which wins first, a cyborg Gordon Ryan

2:55:59.960 --> 2:56:03.360
 or an artificial robot Gordon Ryan?

2:56:03.360 --> 2:56:05.180
 Really, really strong question,

2:56:05.180 --> 2:56:09.700
 and I think by far the cyborg Gordon Ryan.

2:56:09.700 --> 2:56:11.260
 Yeah, that's what I'm thinking here.

2:56:11.260 --> 2:56:13.060
 The problems you're talking about

2:56:14.260 --> 2:56:16.660
 with regards to the robots, those are deep problems.

2:56:16.660 --> 2:56:20.020
 Like if picking up a cup is problematic,

2:56:20.020 --> 2:56:22.260
 it's gonna be damn difficult,

2:56:22.260 --> 2:56:25.420
 but to a human, a two year old can do that.

2:56:25.420 --> 2:56:28.140
 You're highlighting a very important difference

2:56:28.140 --> 2:56:31.380
 is human beings have something called common sense

2:56:32.260 --> 2:56:35.020
 that we don't know how to build into computers currently.

2:56:35.020 --> 2:56:36.820
 That's what picking up the cup is.

2:56:37.780 --> 2:56:41.340
 It's some basic rules about the way this world works.

2:56:41.340 --> 2:56:43.420
 We're able to, this is when we're children

2:56:43.420 --> 2:56:46.140
 and we'll crawl around and we pick up.

2:56:46.140 --> 2:56:48.500
 What humans don't have that machines have

2:56:48.500 --> 2:56:52.020
 is incredible computational power

2:56:52.020 --> 2:56:54.440
 and access to infinite knowledge.

2:56:54.440 --> 2:56:55.500
 Computers can do that.

2:56:55.500 --> 2:56:58.460
 So if you have a Gordon Ryan with the infinite knowledge

2:56:58.460 --> 2:57:01.820
 and compute power, that's just going to,

2:57:01.820 --> 2:57:03.700
 because we know how to do that,

2:57:03.700 --> 2:57:07.660
 that's going to blow out of the water

2:57:07.660 --> 2:57:08.500
 a robot that's trying to learn to crawl.

2:57:08.500 --> 2:57:12.180
 Has there been any update on the phenomenon

2:57:12.180 --> 2:57:14.420
 of cyborg or centaur chess?

2:57:14.420 --> 2:57:16.580
 There was some debate as to whether or not

2:57:19.220 --> 2:57:22.740
 cyborg chess teams could stay competitive

2:57:22.740 --> 2:57:25.940
 with the latest machine learning.

2:57:25.940 --> 2:57:27.740
 Has there been any update on that?

2:57:27.740 --> 2:57:31.060
 I believe at this point machines dominate

2:57:31.060 --> 2:57:34.740
 over the machine human pairs.

2:57:34.740 --> 2:57:37.700
 With the human pairs, when they first came out,

2:57:37.700 --> 2:57:41.740
 they were good chess players, but not great chess players.

2:57:41.740 --> 2:57:43.900
 Does it make any difference if you have, say,

2:57:43.900 --> 2:57:48.900
 Garry Kasparov and a computer working in unison

2:57:48.900 --> 2:57:52.620
 versus Joe Blow from?

2:57:52.620 --> 2:57:53.920
 It does make a huge difference,

2:57:53.920 --> 2:57:56.740
 but yeah, both are destroyed by machines at this point.

2:57:56.740 --> 2:57:58.220
 And it's not even competitive now?

2:57:58.220 --> 2:57:59.460
 No, it's not competitive.

2:57:59.460 --> 2:58:03.220
 But they also lost interest in this kind of idea.

2:58:03.220 --> 2:58:04.940
 So I think there's still competitions

2:58:04.940 --> 2:58:09.220
 between human machine pairs versus human machine pairs,

2:58:09.220 --> 2:58:12.660
 almost like to see how the two work together.

2:58:12.660 --> 2:58:14.980
 But in terms of machine versus human machine pair,

2:58:14.980 --> 2:58:16.060
 machines still dominate.

2:58:16.060 --> 2:58:16.900
 Interesting.

2:58:16.900 --> 2:58:21.900
 So, and now we've retrieved back as human beings

2:58:21.900 --> 2:58:24.580
 caring mostly about human versus human competitions,

2:58:24.580 --> 2:58:27.140
 which is probably what the future will look like.

2:58:27.140 --> 2:58:29.060
 It's very interesting to think,

2:58:29.060 --> 2:58:32.200
 but like that in chess happened really quickly.

2:58:32.200 --> 2:58:36.340
 It won't happen, and it wasn't so painful in chess

2:58:36.340 --> 2:58:37.420
 because we care about chess,

2:58:37.420 --> 2:58:40.640
 but it's not so fundamental to human society.

2:58:41.680 --> 2:58:46.180
 And when you started talking about cyborg Gordon Ryans,

2:58:46.180 --> 2:58:49.140
 which really beyond grappling is referring

2:58:49.140 --> 2:58:52.180
 to robots operating physical space

2:58:52.180 --> 2:58:56.300
 or human robot hybrids operating physical space,

2:58:56.300 --> 2:59:00.140
 you're talking about our society is now full of cyborgs.

2:59:00.140 --> 2:59:00.980
 Yes.

2:59:00.980 --> 2:59:05.160
 And that transition might be very painful

2:59:05.160 --> 2:59:10.160
 or transformative in a way we can't even predict.

2:59:10.420 --> 2:59:13.820
 And that very much has applications

2:59:13.820 --> 2:59:17.180
 as both China and US now have legalized

2:59:18.300 --> 2:59:20.720
 is autonomous weapon systems.

2:59:20.720 --> 2:59:24.940
 So use of these kinds of systems in military applications.

2:59:24.940 --> 2:59:27.180
 So it used to be, there'd been a big call

2:59:27.180 --> 2:59:29.620
 in the AI community to ban autonomous weapons.

2:59:29.620 --> 2:59:33.600
 So the use of artificial intelligence in war,

2:59:33.600 --> 2:59:37.780
 just like bioweapons are banned internationally.

2:59:37.780 --> 2:59:40.220
 So you're not allowed to use bioweapons in war.

2:59:40.220 --> 2:59:43.320
 And actually most people, even terrorists,

2:59:43.320 --> 2:59:46.420
 have kind of agreed on this ban.

2:59:46.420 --> 2:59:49.340
 It's not like, there's been a quiet agreement,

2:59:49.340 --> 2:59:51.080
 like we're not going to be doing this

2:59:51.080 --> 2:59:54.240
 because everybody's gonna get really pissed off.

2:59:54.240 --> 2:59:58.240
 With autonomous weapon systems, that's not been the case.

2:59:59.260 --> 3:00:01.820
 China has said that they're going to be using AI

3:00:01.820 --> 3:00:03.140
 in their military.

3:00:03.140 --> 3:00:08.140
 And the US in 2021 just released a report

3:00:08.420 --> 3:00:12.900
 saying that they're going to add

3:00:12.900 --> 3:00:15.300
 increasing amounts of artificial intelligence

3:00:15.300 --> 3:00:17.260
 into our military systems.

3:00:17.260 --> 3:00:19.780
 Into drones, into just everything that's doing

3:00:19.780 --> 3:00:24.320
 any kind of both strategic and actual bombing

3:00:24.320 --> 3:00:27.180
 and defense systems.

3:00:27.180 --> 3:00:31.120
 I presume a drone army would easily defeat

3:00:31.120 --> 3:00:33.540
 a human army in the near future.

3:00:33.540 --> 3:00:38.540
 Like, I mean, just off the top of my head,

3:00:38.540 --> 3:00:40.980
 just think about the implication of kamikaze drones

3:00:40.980 --> 3:00:42.300
 versus a naval fleet.

3:00:42.300 --> 3:00:45.620
 I mean, kamikazes was humans in World War II,

3:00:45.620 --> 3:00:47.940
 did terrible damage to our navy.

3:00:47.940 --> 3:00:52.940
 Imagine swarms of mechanical kamikazes

3:00:53.340 --> 3:00:55.980
 which have no fear, no remorse, I mean.

3:00:55.980 --> 3:00:58.580
 But it's very inefficient.

3:00:58.580 --> 3:00:59.960
 Kamikaze is very inefficient.

3:00:59.960 --> 3:01:03.440
 You want to be very, like war is,

3:01:03.440 --> 3:01:06.100
 it's the same discussion to jiu jitsu, right?

3:01:06.100 --> 3:01:10.660
 You want to be, you want to create an asymmetry of power

3:01:10.660 --> 3:01:12.580
 and you want to be efficient is in the way you deliver

3:01:12.580 --> 3:01:13.860
 that power.

3:01:13.860 --> 3:01:17.060
 It's actually goes back to the picking up a cup.

3:01:17.060 --> 3:01:21.580
 Currently, a lot of things we do in war,

3:01:21.580 --> 3:01:24.020
 like most of the drones that you hear about,

3:01:24.020 --> 3:01:26.140
 they're not autonomous, not most, all.

3:01:26.140 --> 3:01:27.340
 They're usually piloted by.

3:01:27.340 --> 3:01:30.140
 They're piloted remotely by humans.

3:01:30.140 --> 3:01:33.620
 And humans are really good at this kind of

3:01:33.620 --> 3:01:35.700
 what's necessary to deliver the most damage,

3:01:35.700 --> 3:01:39.340
 targeted damage, effective as part of the largest strategy

3:01:39.340 --> 3:01:43.020
 you have about bombing the area or all that kind of stuff.

3:01:43.020 --> 3:01:45.500
 I don't know how difficult that is to automate.

3:01:45.500 --> 3:01:47.700
 I think the biggest concern,

3:01:47.700 --> 3:01:51.620
 I actually have a sense that it's very difficult to automate.

3:01:51.620 --> 3:01:53.840
 The biggest concern is almost like

3:01:53.840 --> 3:01:56.060
 an incompetent application of this

3:01:56.940 --> 3:02:01.140
 and consequences that are not anticipated.

3:02:01.140 --> 3:02:05.000
 So you have a drone army where you say,

3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:06.620
 we want to target,

3:02:06.620 --> 3:02:09.580
 you give it power to target a particular terrorist.

3:02:09.580 --> 3:02:12.140
 And then there's some bug in the system

3:02:12.140 --> 3:02:15.860
 that has a, like for example,

3:02:15.860 --> 3:02:18.820
 has a large uncertainty about the location of that terrorist.

3:02:18.820 --> 3:02:21.000
 And so it decides to bomb an entire city.

3:02:22.100 --> 3:02:25.140
 You know, almost like there's a bug, a software bug.

3:02:25.140 --> 3:02:28.500
 I'm much more concerned about like bad programming

3:02:28.500 --> 3:02:31.260
 and software engineering than I am about

3:02:31.260 --> 3:02:36.180
 like malevolent AI systems that destroy the world.

3:02:36.180 --> 3:02:38.720
 So the more we rely on automation,

3:02:38.720 --> 3:02:40.160
 this is the lesson of human history.

3:02:40.160 --> 3:02:45.160
 The more we give to AI, to software, to robotic systems,

3:02:45.700 --> 3:02:49.700
 the more we forget how to supervise

3:02:49.700 --> 3:02:52.180
 and oversee some of the edge cases,

3:02:52.180 --> 3:02:54.500
 all the weird ways that things go wrong.

3:02:54.500 --> 3:02:58.520
 And then the more stupid software bugs

3:02:58.520 --> 3:02:59.880
 can lead to huge damage.

3:02:59.880 --> 3:03:03.940
 Like, you know, even like nuclear explosions,

3:03:03.940 --> 3:03:05.700
 those kinds of things.

3:03:05.700 --> 3:03:09.680
 If we add AI into the launch systems

3:03:09.680 --> 3:03:11.460
 for nuclear weapons, for example,

3:03:13.260 --> 3:03:17.020
 I think human history teaches us that software bugs

3:03:17.020 --> 3:03:21.060
 is what will lead to World War III,

3:03:21.060 --> 3:03:25.740
 not malevolent AI or human beings.

3:03:25.740 --> 3:03:26.820
 Interesting.

3:03:26.820 --> 3:03:29.460
 By the way, I deeply appreciate how knowledgeable you are

3:03:29.460 --> 3:03:31.260
 about the history of artificial intelligence.

3:03:31.260 --> 3:03:32.100
 That was awesome.

3:03:32.100 --> 3:03:33.640
 Oh no, it's fascinating stuff.

3:03:33.640 --> 3:03:36.060
 You know, I remember reading when I was a child

3:03:36.060 --> 3:03:38.580
 about, you know, Turing tests and things like this,

3:03:38.580 --> 3:03:42.140
 and visionaries from the 1950s had ideas.

3:03:42.140 --> 3:03:44.740
 To see it come this far is just so fascinating to me.

3:03:47.840 --> 3:03:50.300
 Okay, so what can we as jiu jitsu players

3:03:50.300 --> 3:03:51.300
 take away from this?

3:03:51.300 --> 3:03:55.860
 We saw that when it comes to computers versus humans

3:03:55.860 --> 3:03:57.620
 in chess tournaments,

3:03:57.620 --> 3:04:01.140
 humans had something truly valuable

3:04:01.140 --> 3:04:03.300
 to give to the computers.

3:04:03.300 --> 3:04:04.980
 That was heuristic rules.

3:04:05.980 --> 3:04:09.580
 In every coaching program that I run,

3:04:09.580 --> 3:04:14.260
 I make an endless quest to search out

3:04:14.260 --> 3:04:17.700
 and find effective heuristic rules.

3:04:17.700 --> 3:04:20.060
 That's the basis of a good training program.

3:04:21.020 --> 3:04:22.980
 Heuristic rules and principles

3:04:24.420 --> 3:04:27.560
 give vast informational content,

3:04:27.560 --> 3:04:30.820
 which can rapidly increase your performance on the mat,

3:04:30.820 --> 3:04:33.100
 just as they rapidly increase the performance

3:04:33.100 --> 3:04:37.180
 of chess computers to overcome their human adversaries.

3:04:39.480 --> 3:04:43.660
 The great human weakness is computational power.

3:04:43.660 --> 3:04:47.980
 Most people vastly overestimate their ability

3:04:47.980 --> 3:04:51.460
 to reason and problem solve under stress.

3:04:51.460 --> 3:04:54.360
 In fact, numerous psychological studies have shown

3:04:54.360 --> 3:04:57.420
 that humans can balance a relatively small number

3:04:57.420 --> 3:05:02.420
 of competing options in stressful decision making.

3:05:03.820 --> 3:05:05.060
 But what we do have,

3:05:05.060 --> 3:05:08.420
 what is the great and unique human gift

3:05:09.540 --> 3:05:11.900
 is this idea to come up and arrive

3:05:11.900 --> 3:05:14.160
 at heuristic rules and principles,

3:05:14.160 --> 3:05:17.940
 which turn out to be very effective guides to behavior

3:05:17.940 --> 3:05:19.460
 for both human behavior

3:05:19.460 --> 3:05:21.660
 and artificially intelligent behavior.

3:05:21.660 --> 3:05:26.500
 Make that your focus in study.

3:05:27.460 --> 3:05:31.340
 Don't try to remember 10,000 different details on a move.

3:05:31.340 --> 3:05:34.820
 Okay, that's human weakness, not human strength.

3:05:34.820 --> 3:05:36.860
 Our strength is heuristics.

3:05:36.860 --> 3:05:38.820
 Make that your focus,

3:05:38.820 --> 3:05:42.860
 not endless computations over 25 details here

3:05:42.860 --> 3:05:44.460
 merged with 27 details here.

3:05:44.460 --> 3:05:46.500
 That's not what humans are good at.

3:05:46.500 --> 3:05:51.300
 The uniquely human strength is arriving

3:05:51.300 --> 3:05:53.260
 at these heuristic rules and principles

3:05:53.260 --> 3:05:54.740
 which guide our behavior,

3:05:54.740 --> 3:05:56.940
 which provides simplifications,

3:05:56.940 --> 3:06:00.060
 which enable us to take vast amounts of information

3:06:00.060 --> 3:06:02.140
 and parry it down to a few simple rules

3:06:02.140 --> 3:06:04.340
 that effectively guide our behavior.

3:06:04.340 --> 3:06:06.380
 Take that core insight from the discussion

3:06:06.380 --> 3:06:07.380
 that Lex and I just had.

3:06:07.380 --> 3:06:08.620
 It was a complex discussion.

3:06:08.620 --> 3:06:10.900
 We both apologize for going a little bit overboard.

3:06:10.900 --> 3:06:11.740
 That was awesome.

3:06:11.740 --> 3:06:13.160
 Then dragging you into some details there,

3:06:13.160 --> 3:06:14.000
 but take that away from it.

3:06:14.000 --> 3:06:14.840
 I love it.

3:06:14.840 --> 3:06:16.540
 It'll make you better at jujitsu.

3:06:16.540 --> 3:06:17.380
 Sorry, Lex.

3:06:18.580 --> 3:06:21.580
 That was a really exciting discussion,

3:06:21.580 --> 3:06:25.060
 and the depths of knowledge

3:06:25.060 --> 3:06:27.460
 in the dimensions of knowledge you have

3:06:27.460 --> 3:06:30.100
 and interests you have is just fascinating.

3:06:30.100 --> 3:06:32.940
 Is there advice you have for complete beginners,

3:06:33.980 --> 3:06:36.460
 for white belts that are starting jujitsu,

3:06:36.460 --> 3:06:37.380
 that are listening to this,

3:06:37.380 --> 3:06:38.460
 that haven't done jujitsu?

3:06:38.460 --> 3:06:39.620
 I know there's a lot of people

3:06:39.620 --> 3:06:42.660
 who are super curious to start.

3:06:42.660 --> 3:06:45.980
 Is there advice you would give them on their journey?

3:06:45.980 --> 3:06:47.540
 Yeah, I'm just gonna talk about

3:06:47.540 --> 3:06:50.140
 just getting better on the mat, okay?

3:06:50.140 --> 3:06:51.300
 Because there's a thousand other things

3:06:51.300 --> 3:06:54.220
 you can talk about in terms of morale and persistence

3:06:54.220 --> 3:06:56.300
 and how often that you're trained

3:06:56.300 --> 3:06:57.140
 is a thousand things you'd give.

3:06:57.140 --> 3:06:59.340
 Break up with your girlfriend or boyfriend.

3:06:59.340 --> 3:07:00.180
 That's one.

3:07:00.180 --> 3:07:01.000
 I'm just kidding.

3:07:01.000 --> 3:07:01.840
 Let's put that aside.

3:07:02.920 --> 3:07:05.820
 That's probably the best advice we could give.

3:07:05.820 --> 3:07:07.940
 It goes back to what we said earlier.

3:07:07.940 --> 3:07:11.980
 I always advocate start your training from the ground up.

3:07:11.980 --> 3:07:15.620
 Okay, your first sessions in jujitsu,

3:07:15.620 --> 3:07:18.140
 you're going to find to your horror

3:07:18.140 --> 3:07:21.380
 that everyone gets on top of you and you can't get out.

3:07:21.380 --> 3:07:24.700
 And it's a dispiriting, crushing kind of feeling

3:07:24.700 --> 3:07:26.340
 that you just have no skills

3:07:26.340 --> 3:07:28.740
 and you have no prospects in the sport.

3:07:28.740 --> 3:07:31.020
 So your first skill is the skill of being able

3:07:31.020 --> 3:07:33.880
 to free yourself from positional pins.

3:07:35.100 --> 3:07:38.980
 Most of the escapes in jujitsu go to guard position.

3:07:38.980 --> 3:07:41.420
 And so once you get someone in your guard,

3:07:41.420 --> 3:07:43.100
 they're going to be looking to pass your guard

3:07:43.100 --> 3:07:45.120
 and get back into those positional pins

3:07:45.120 --> 3:07:47.180
 that you just escaped from.

3:07:47.180 --> 3:07:49.500
 And that's just as crushing as getting pinned.

3:07:49.500 --> 3:07:51.500
 You feel like every time you try to hold someone in guard,

3:07:51.500 --> 3:07:53.260
 they just effortlessly pass you by.

3:07:54.300 --> 3:07:56.300
 So your first two skills,

3:07:56.300 --> 3:07:58.120
 you got to be able to get out of any pin

3:07:58.120 --> 3:08:00.220
 and you got to be able to hold someone in your guard.

3:08:00.220 --> 3:08:02.280
 So pin escapes and guard retention

3:08:02.280 --> 3:08:04.180
 are your first two skills.

3:08:04.180 --> 3:08:08.740
 I generally advocate the idea of learning to fight

3:08:08.740 --> 3:08:12.100
 from your back first and then learning to fight

3:08:12.100 --> 3:08:13.720
 from on top second.

3:08:13.720 --> 3:08:14.560
 Why?

3:08:14.560 --> 3:08:16.920
 Because the brute fact is when you first start off,

3:08:16.920 --> 3:08:19.300
 you just don't have enough skills to hold top position

3:08:19.300 --> 3:08:21.460
 or gain top position through a takedown.

3:08:21.460 --> 3:08:23.920
 So inevitably you're going to end up underneath people

3:08:23.920 --> 3:08:25.880
 for most of your training time.

3:08:25.880 --> 3:08:28.740
 Your training should reflect that in the early days

3:08:28.740 --> 3:08:30.100
 as a white belt.

3:08:30.100 --> 3:08:32.340
 Start with the first two skills you need.

3:08:32.340 --> 3:08:33.500
 They're not the most exciting.

3:08:33.500 --> 3:08:35.380
 They're not sexy skills that are going to make you look

3:08:35.380 --> 3:08:36.780
 like a stud in the training room,

3:08:36.780 --> 3:08:38.580
 but they're going to keep your life long enough

3:08:38.580 --> 3:08:40.620
 to learn those sexy skills in the future

3:08:40.620 --> 3:08:43.220
 that will make you look like a stud.

3:08:43.220 --> 3:08:46.520
 Start with pin escapes, go to guard retention

3:08:46.520 --> 3:08:49.420
 and focus heavily on those two.

3:08:49.420 --> 3:08:51.460
 When you start to get into offense,

3:08:51.460 --> 3:08:53.780
 start with bottom position.

3:08:53.780 --> 3:08:56.940
 So there's a clear continuity between your pin escapes,

3:08:56.940 --> 3:09:00.500
 your guard retention, and then your guard itself.

3:09:00.500 --> 3:09:01.340
 Okay?

3:09:01.340 --> 3:09:03.700
 You've got different options with guard.

3:09:03.700 --> 3:09:05.180
 Some of you are going to like closed guard.

3:09:05.180 --> 3:09:08.140
 Some of you are going to like variations of open guard.

3:09:08.140 --> 3:09:09.420
 Some of you are going to like to be seated.

3:09:09.420 --> 3:09:11.220
 Some of you are going to like to be supine.

3:09:11.220 --> 3:09:13.580
 Some of you are going to like half guard.

3:09:13.580 --> 3:09:17.300
 As a general rule, this is a heavy generalization,

3:09:17.300 --> 3:09:18.940
 but I'm going to give it to you.

3:09:18.940 --> 3:09:22.400
 In my experience, most people benefit the most

3:09:22.400 --> 3:09:24.860
 by starting with half guard first.

3:09:24.860 --> 3:09:27.100
 I know that traditionally Jiu Jitsu has been taught

3:09:27.100 --> 3:09:28.220
 closed guard first,

3:09:28.220 --> 3:09:30.900
 and then all the other guards come after that.

3:09:30.900 --> 3:09:34.740
 I'm a big believer in the idea of start with pin escapes,

3:09:34.740 --> 3:09:36.380
 then go to guard retention,

3:09:36.380 --> 3:09:38.180
 and then start with half guard bottom.

3:09:38.180 --> 3:09:39.740
 That way you get a nice continuity

3:09:39.740 --> 3:09:41.540
 between your first three skills,

3:09:41.540 --> 3:09:43.100
 and you'll make good progress

3:09:43.100 --> 3:09:45.920
 over those first critical six months in Jiu Jitsu.

3:09:46.860 --> 3:09:50.340
 What does it take to get a black belt in Jiu Jitsu?

3:09:50.340 --> 3:09:51.740
 Very little.

3:09:51.740 --> 3:09:52.580
 Ha ha ha.

3:09:55.020 --> 3:09:56.940
 To show up, pay your fees.

3:09:58.220 --> 3:10:00.300
 Don't set your goals low, okay?

3:10:00.300 --> 3:10:01.900
 Don't even ask yourself that question.

3:10:01.900 --> 3:10:03.820
 No one cares if you've got a black belt, okay?

3:10:03.820 --> 3:10:06.060
 The only thing that counts is the skills you have.

3:10:06.060 --> 3:10:09.260
 I know plenty of black belts that suck, okay?

3:10:09.260 --> 3:10:10.860
 There's a lot of them out there.

3:10:11.900 --> 3:10:13.900
 Don't lower your standards by saying,

3:10:13.900 --> 3:10:15.300
 I want to get a black belt.

3:10:16.260 --> 3:10:18.940
 Ask yourself something much more important.

3:10:18.940 --> 3:10:20.780
 How good do I want to be?

3:10:20.780 --> 3:10:21.940
 You want to be damn good, right?

3:10:21.940 --> 3:10:23.060
 You want to do something in this time,

3:10:23.060 --> 3:10:24.780
 and you want to be the best you can.

3:10:24.780 --> 3:10:27.700
 Wearing a belt around your waist doesn't guarantee that.

3:10:27.700 --> 3:10:29.540
 Build skills, focus on that.

3:10:31.020 --> 3:10:33.540
 Let me ask you about the fourth thing

3:10:33.540 --> 3:10:38.540
 in facet face of Jiu Jitsu, which is self defense.

3:10:39.700 --> 3:10:42.060
 Let's say the bigger things,

3:10:42.060 --> 3:10:44.780
 I don't know why it's called self defense.

3:10:44.780 --> 3:10:46.780
 Let's call it street fighting.

3:10:46.780 --> 3:10:49.420
 Let's call it fighting, okay?

3:10:49.420 --> 3:10:51.580
 Maybe you can contest that terminology.

3:10:51.580 --> 3:10:53.620
 How about non sport fighting?

3:10:53.620 --> 3:10:54.860
 Non sport fighting.

3:10:54.860 --> 3:10:55.980
 It's funny, like street fighting.

3:10:55.980 --> 3:10:57.340
 What happens if you go out on a playground,

3:10:57.340 --> 3:10:58.260
 and you're fighting on grass?

3:10:58.260 --> 3:11:00.020
 Is there no longer street fighting?

3:11:00.020 --> 3:11:00.860
 It's like tennis.

3:11:00.860 --> 3:11:04.180
 You have like Wimbledon, like grass courts,

3:11:04.180 --> 3:11:05.500
 it's a whole nother thing.

3:11:07.500 --> 3:11:09.580
 What do you think is the best martial art

3:11:09.580 --> 3:11:11.420
 for street fighting?

3:11:11.420 --> 3:11:14.140
 What is the best set of,

3:11:14.140 --> 3:11:16.620
 we talked about advice for white belts

3:11:16.620 --> 3:11:21.620
 to advance in grappling in Jiu Jitsu.

3:11:22.100 --> 3:11:24.540
 What is the set of techniques,

3:11:24.540 --> 3:11:27.740
 maybe martial art that is best for street fighting?

3:11:27.740 --> 3:11:31.260
 Okay, again, you're asking some

3:11:31.260 --> 3:11:32.940
 truly fascinating questions here.

3:11:37.620 --> 3:11:39.980
 The way this gets framed as a question

3:11:39.980 --> 3:11:43.460
 is often condemns you to bad answers from the start.

3:11:44.700 --> 3:11:46.420
 This is...

3:11:46.420 --> 3:11:49.940
 As a questioner, I'm trying to achieve asymmetry of power.

3:11:50.860 --> 3:11:51.740
 And I'm winning.

3:11:53.940 --> 3:11:55.420
 Put you in a bad position.

3:11:55.420 --> 3:11:58.020
 Don't worry so much about...

3:11:58.020 --> 3:11:58.860
 People are always gonna say,

3:11:58.860 --> 3:12:00.020
 you know, is this martial art better?

3:12:00.020 --> 3:12:01.100
 Or is this martial arts better?

3:12:01.100 --> 3:12:06.100
 The truth is there's only one way to say this.

3:12:09.860 --> 3:12:14.860
 Combat sports are your best option for self defense.

3:12:15.820 --> 3:12:17.460
 There are many martial arts,

3:12:17.460 --> 3:12:20.820
 and there is a rough divide between the two.

3:12:20.820 --> 3:12:22.700
 Those that fall into combat sports,

3:12:22.700 --> 3:12:27.700
 and those that fall into non sporting martial arts,

3:12:27.740 --> 3:12:32.740
 where there's no competitive live sparring element,

3:12:36.700 --> 3:12:40.220
 where most of the knowledge is limited

3:12:40.220 --> 3:12:44.180
 to theoretical knowledge reinforced by passive drilling.

3:12:46.060 --> 3:12:48.900
 If you have a choice between a combat sport

3:12:48.900 --> 3:12:52.940
 versus a non sporting art

3:12:52.940 --> 3:12:55.500
 based around theoretical knowledge and passive drilling,

3:12:55.500 --> 3:12:56.900
 go with a combat sport.

3:12:58.300 --> 3:13:02.100
 Nothing will prepare you for the intensity

3:13:04.540 --> 3:13:09.260
 of a genuine altercation better than combat sports.

3:13:10.940 --> 3:13:13.060
 Many people, as I say these words,

3:13:13.060 --> 3:13:15.980
 they're probably horrified to hear me say this,

3:13:15.980 --> 3:13:19.500
 and immediately going to rebut and say,

3:13:19.500 --> 3:13:23.140
 no, combat sports is exactly the wrong thing for you to do

3:13:23.140 --> 3:13:26.620
 because they have safety rules, et cetera, et cetera,

3:13:26.620 --> 3:13:30.260
 which would easily be exploited in a real fight.

3:13:30.260 --> 3:13:32.620
 And if I fought a world championship boxer,

3:13:32.620 --> 3:13:33.700
 I would just poke him in the eye

3:13:33.700 --> 3:13:35.220
 or kick him in the groin, et cetera, et cetera.

3:13:35.220 --> 3:13:38.220
 You've heard these arguments a thousand times.

3:13:38.220 --> 3:13:40.940
 Yes, there is some validity to these things,

3:13:40.940 --> 3:13:42.980
 but as a general rule,

3:13:42.980 --> 3:13:47.420
 if you ask me to bet in any form of street fight,

3:13:47.420 --> 3:13:48.500
 call it what you want,

3:13:48.500 --> 3:13:52.260
 between a combat sport adherent

3:13:52.260 --> 3:13:56.420
 versus someone who simply trains with drills

3:13:56.420 --> 3:13:59.180
 and talks in terms of theories

3:13:59.180 --> 3:14:00.940
 of what they would do in a fight,

3:14:00.940 --> 3:14:04.620
 I'm gonna go with the combat sport guy every single time.

3:14:05.700 --> 3:14:08.060
 Now, having said that,

3:14:08.060 --> 3:14:11.660
 combat sports need to be modified

3:14:11.660 --> 3:14:14.420
 for the use of self defense street fighting.

3:14:14.420 --> 3:14:15.660
 We haven't agreed on a term yet.

3:14:15.660 --> 3:14:16.980
 We'll figure it out later.

3:14:18.460 --> 3:14:21.260
 What does this modification consist of?

3:14:21.260 --> 3:14:23.540
 Well, some of it is technical, okay?

3:14:23.540 --> 3:14:26.700
 For example, a boxer in a street fight

3:14:27.900 --> 3:14:31.100
 now has to punch without wrapped or gloved hands,

3:14:31.100 --> 3:14:32.660
 and that's problematic, okay?

3:14:32.660 --> 3:14:35.460
 Your hands are not really designed

3:14:35.460 --> 3:14:38.820
 for heavy extended use of clubbing hard objects.

3:14:38.820 --> 3:14:41.620
 There's a very high likelihood of breaking your hands.

3:14:41.620 --> 3:14:44.780
 Mike Tyson was one of the finest punchers that ever lived,

3:14:44.780 --> 3:14:46.460
 but in one of his more famous street fights

3:14:46.460 --> 3:14:50.100
 against Mitch Green in the late 1980s,

3:14:50.100 --> 3:14:52.860
 he broke his hand with one punch

3:14:52.860 --> 3:14:53.820
 that he threw at his opponent.

3:14:53.820 --> 3:14:56.340
 He hit the wrong part of the head and broke his hand,

3:14:56.340 --> 3:14:58.580
 and he was one of the most gifted punchers of all time.

3:14:58.580 --> 3:14:59.780
 If he can do it,

3:14:59.780 --> 3:15:02.980
 you'll certainly have trouble protecting your hands

3:15:02.980 --> 3:15:04.300
 when you go to throw blows.

3:15:06.740 --> 3:15:09.620
 Nonetheless, this was easily modified,

3:15:09.620 --> 3:15:14.620
 and so a boxer can throw with open hands or with elbows,

3:15:16.340 --> 3:15:19.460
 and so just a small modification and technique

3:15:19.460 --> 3:15:21.940
 can overcome that problem.

3:15:21.940 --> 3:15:26.220
 So what you'll find is that the general physical,

3:15:26.220 --> 3:15:28.700
 mental conditioning, and skill development

3:15:28.700 --> 3:15:30.420
 that comes from combat sports

3:15:31.700 --> 3:15:36.220
 allied with technical modifications,

3:15:36.220 --> 3:15:38.580
 and then the most important of all,

3:15:38.580 --> 3:15:43.340
 tactical modifications will provide your best hope

3:15:43.340 --> 3:15:47.260
 in altercations outside of sports in the street

3:15:47.260 --> 3:15:49.260
 or wherever you find yourself.

3:15:52.180 --> 3:15:55.420
 The least effective approaches to self defense

3:15:55.420 --> 3:15:56.980
 that I have observed in my life

3:15:56.980 --> 3:15:59.140
 have been those where, as I said,

3:15:59.140 --> 3:16:04.140
 people talked theory, drilled on passive opponents,

3:16:04.140 --> 3:16:08.740
 and generally had no engagement in live competition

3:16:08.740 --> 3:16:11.300
 or sparring in their training programs.

3:16:13.060 --> 3:16:16.180
 The most effective by a landslide

3:16:16.180 --> 3:16:21.180
 were those that put a heavy emphasis on live sparring

3:16:21.380 --> 3:16:26.140
 and sporting competition modified both technically

3:16:26.140 --> 3:16:28.300
 and tactically for the circumstances

3:16:28.300 --> 3:16:29.740
 in which they found themselves.

3:16:30.740 --> 3:16:33.580
 People talk, for example, about how, you know,

3:16:33.580 --> 3:16:37.500
 and with some validity that weapons

3:16:37.500 --> 3:16:39.540
 will change everything in a street fight.

3:16:39.540 --> 3:16:41.340
 There's absolute truth to that,

3:16:41.340 --> 3:16:44.620
 but this extends into weapons as well, okay?

3:16:44.620 --> 3:16:49.620
 The most effective forms of knife fighting that you'll see

3:16:49.660 --> 3:16:53.140
 will be those who come from a background in fencing

3:16:53.140 --> 3:16:56.900
 because it has sparring and a competitive sport aspect to it,

3:16:56.900 --> 3:16:59.300
 but would pure fencing be the appropriate thing?

3:16:59.300 --> 3:17:01.020
 Of course not, you'd have to modify it,

3:17:01.020 --> 3:17:03.980
 but the reflexes, endurance, physical mobility

3:17:03.980 --> 3:17:05.780
 that you gain from the sport of fencing

3:17:05.780 --> 3:17:10.540
 could easily be modified to bladecraft in a fight situation.

3:17:10.540 --> 3:17:14.740
 What you want to look for with regards street

3:17:14.740 --> 3:17:18.340
 and self defense is not, okay, which style should I choose?

3:17:18.340 --> 3:17:19.460
 Should I choose taekwondo?

3:17:19.460 --> 3:17:20.420
 Should I choose karate?

3:17:20.420 --> 3:17:22.460
 Should I choose this variation of kung fu?

3:17:22.460 --> 3:17:24.980
 No, focus on the most important thing.

3:17:24.980 --> 3:17:27.660
 Does it have a sport aspect to it?

3:17:27.660 --> 3:17:30.060
 Then once you've made sufficient progress

3:17:30.060 --> 3:17:32.180
 in the sport aspect of that martial art,

3:17:32.180 --> 3:17:35.580
 start asking yourself, what are the requisite modifications

3:17:35.580 --> 3:17:38.660
 and technique and tactics that I have to use

3:17:38.660 --> 3:17:43.620
 or to input to make it effective for street situations?

3:17:43.620 --> 3:17:45.620
 That's always the advice that I give.

3:17:45.620 --> 3:17:47.580
 Let me zoom in on a very particular aspect

3:17:47.580 --> 3:17:50.900
 of street fighting where, with all due respect,

3:17:50.900 --> 3:17:54.700
 I disagree with Mr. Joe Rogan and George St. Pierre on,

3:17:54.700 --> 3:17:57.140
 which is the suit and tie situation.

3:17:57.140 --> 3:18:00.180
 Now, to criticize GSP, yeah, yeah,

3:18:00.180 --> 3:18:01.540
 he's very accomplished and everything,

3:18:01.540 --> 3:18:03.500
 but to criticize him for a bit,

3:18:03.500 --> 3:18:07.300
 he made claims about how dangerous the tie is

3:18:07.300 --> 3:18:09.020
 in a street fighting situation

3:18:09.020 --> 3:18:12.780
 without ever having used it in a fighting situation.

3:18:12.780 --> 3:18:15.980
 So he made sort of broad proclamations

3:18:15.980 --> 3:18:18.460
 without understanding the fundamentals.

3:18:18.460 --> 3:18:23.240
 So I thought I would go to somebody who thinks in systems.

3:18:23.240 --> 3:18:28.240
 What do you think, is it dangerous to wear a tie

3:18:29.600 --> 3:18:32.200
 or not in a grappling situation

3:18:32.200 --> 3:18:33.040
 versus all the other weapons?

3:18:33.040 --> 3:18:35.560
 Yeah, but we would do it in a street fight, yeah.

3:18:35.560 --> 3:18:37.280
 It would be rather strange to wear a tie

3:18:37.280 --> 3:18:38.480
 in a grappling competition.

3:18:38.480 --> 3:18:40.520
 It would be, it would be.

3:18:40.520 --> 3:18:42.480
 Yes, in a street fight situation.

3:18:42.480 --> 3:18:43.320
 Okay, yeah.

3:18:43.320 --> 3:18:47.680
 Joe Rogan thinks it is like the most dangerous,

3:18:47.680 --> 3:18:50.360
 it's like it becomes your weakest point

3:18:50.360 --> 3:18:52.960
 if you wear a tie because it's very easy to choke.

3:18:52.960 --> 3:18:55.240
 George St. Pierre seemed to have agreed with that.

3:18:55.240 --> 3:18:59.000
 Also, George added that you can grab the tie

3:18:59.000 --> 3:19:03.120
 and pull the person down to a knee.

3:19:03.120 --> 3:19:04.520
 Yeah, this is the go to.

3:19:04.520 --> 3:19:06.040
 Joe Rogan will go for the choke,

3:19:06.040 --> 3:19:08.720
 George St. Pierre will go for the tie to the knee,

3:19:08.720 --> 3:19:10.600
 which I was saying is ridiculous.

3:19:10.600 --> 3:19:11.560
 So what do you think?

3:19:11.560 --> 3:19:15.100
 Okay, first off, I actually can speak with experience

3:19:15.100 --> 3:19:17.820
 on this because I worked as a bouncer for over a decade

3:19:17.820 --> 3:19:19.940
 and most of the clubs I worked at

3:19:19.940 --> 3:19:21.480
 did not require a suit and tie,

3:19:21.480 --> 3:19:22.780
 but occasionally they did.

3:19:25.720 --> 3:19:27.360
 Okay, let's first differentiate

3:19:27.360 --> 3:19:30.100
 between the kinds of threats when you wear a tie.

3:19:30.100 --> 3:19:33.220
 If you wear a tie, if there is gonna be a threat,

3:19:33.220 --> 3:19:36.540
 by far the more important threat is not strangulation.

3:19:36.540 --> 3:19:40.240
 Okay, being strangled by your tie is possible,

3:19:40.240 --> 3:19:42.100
 but it is a poor choice.

3:19:42.100 --> 3:19:43.920
 There are many other ways to strangle people

3:19:43.920 --> 3:19:45.160
 that are far more efficient.

3:19:45.160 --> 3:19:49.320
 If I strangle by your tie, I'm literally in front of you.

3:19:49.320 --> 3:19:52.400
 That means as I go to apply the strangle hold,

3:19:52.400 --> 3:19:54.240
 I can easily be eye gouged, et cetera, et cetera.

3:19:54.240 --> 3:19:56.200
 If you're gonna strangle people in the street,

3:19:56.200 --> 3:19:59.200
 do it from behind and there's just much better ways

3:19:59.200 --> 3:20:00.040
 to do it than that.

3:20:00.040 --> 3:20:01.120
 Hear that, Joe Rogan?

3:20:02.680 --> 3:20:04.840
 With regards to the snap down question,

3:20:04.840 --> 3:20:07.280
 that is more a problem.

3:20:07.280 --> 3:20:09.720
 I always recommend if you are going to work as a bouncer

3:20:09.720 --> 3:20:12.820
 with a tie, wear a clip on tie

3:20:12.820 --> 3:20:14.440
 so it just comes off immediately.

3:20:14.440 --> 3:20:17.800
 If you don't like clip ons, then you can use a bow tie.

3:20:17.800 --> 3:20:22.200
 I used to work for years in hip hop clubs

3:20:22.200 --> 3:20:26.280
 with members of the Nation of Islam security team.

3:20:26.280 --> 3:20:28.580
 They were known, they had various factions,

3:20:28.580 --> 3:20:30.680
 but the one I worked with were the X Men,

3:20:30.680 --> 3:20:32.280
 and they would always wear bow ties,

3:20:32.280 --> 3:20:34.040
 which of course can't be grabbed.

3:20:34.040 --> 3:20:39.040
 Now, the bow tie was a recognizable part of their brand

3:20:40.920 --> 3:20:42.280
 as security guards, so everyone knew

3:20:42.280 --> 3:20:43.880
 that that's what they wore.

3:20:43.880 --> 3:20:46.960
 If I wore a bow tie in a security situation,

3:20:46.960 --> 3:20:48.600
 people would probably think that I was some kind

3:20:48.600 --> 3:20:52.440
 of Nancy boy and want to fight with me,

3:20:52.440 --> 3:20:53.840
 so I couldn't wear one.

3:20:53.840 --> 3:20:56.000
 So I would always wear a tie

3:20:56.000 --> 3:21:00.120
 which you should become familiar with, Mr. Freeman.

3:21:00.120 --> 3:21:04.960
 That's the Texas bolo tie, which is a kind of shoestring tie

3:21:04.960 --> 3:21:07.080
 which is very, very thin, almost like shoestring

3:21:07.080 --> 3:21:10.300
 and rather short and just has a simple pendant in the middle.

3:21:11.160 --> 3:21:13.240
 This is perfect if you need to wear a tie

3:21:13.240 --> 3:21:14.520
 in a situation where you believe

3:21:14.520 --> 3:21:17.880
 there's a high likelihood of you being grabbed.

3:21:17.880 --> 3:21:18.880
 Because it can't be grabbed.

3:21:18.880 --> 3:21:19.840
 Yeah, there's nothing to grab.

3:21:19.840 --> 3:21:20.960
 It's literally like string.

3:21:20.960 --> 3:21:22.280
 Like if you pulled it,

3:21:22.280 --> 3:21:24.320
 it would just slip through your hand.

3:21:24.320 --> 3:21:26.760
 That tie that you're wearing now,

3:21:26.760 --> 3:21:29.440
 that would give me tremendous control of your head,

3:21:29.440 --> 3:21:32.800
 and I could easily turn it into a hockey fight situation

3:21:32.800 --> 3:21:35.400
 where your head was being pulled down out of balance,

3:21:35.400 --> 3:21:37.440
 and you would have a hard time recovering.

3:21:38.560 --> 3:21:41.800
 So strangulation, not really a problem.

3:21:41.800 --> 3:21:44.960
 Getting pulled down, possible problem.

3:21:44.960 --> 3:21:48.480
 Solutions, clip on tie, bow tie,

3:21:48.480 --> 3:21:50.720
 or if you don't want to look like a Nancy boy,

3:21:50.720 --> 3:21:54.200
 wear a bolo tie.

3:21:54.200 --> 3:21:55.880
 Beautiful, so you disagree with Joe Rogan,

3:21:55.880 --> 3:21:58.280
 agree with George St. Pierre, I love it.

3:21:58.280 --> 3:22:01.280
 I feel like this is an instruction we put together

3:22:01.280 --> 3:22:06.280
 here on street fighting and the tie.

3:22:06.280 --> 3:22:11.280
 Speaking of Joe Rogan, let me ask the following question.

3:22:11.280 --> 3:22:15.000
 He's currently doing a podcast with Gordon Ryan,

3:22:16.720 --> 3:22:20.880
 and probably going to try to convince him and you,

3:22:20.880 --> 3:22:23.160
 as he's already been doing, to move to Austin.

3:22:23.160 --> 3:22:27.600
 What are the chances of the Donoher Death Squad

3:22:27.600 --> 3:22:30.960
 coming to Austin and opening a school in Austin

3:22:30.960 --> 3:22:34.680
 and making Austin home so I can attend the classes there?

3:22:34.680 --> 3:22:36.880
 I would definitely have to think about that.

3:22:36.880 --> 3:22:41.880
 I do know that I personally love New York,

3:22:43.920 --> 3:22:48.920
 but every single person in the squad despised New York

3:22:49.240 --> 3:22:51.280
 and wanted to leave for a long time.

3:22:54.440 --> 3:22:57.120
 What was the nature of your love for New York, by the way?

3:22:57.120 --> 3:22:59.760
 It was truly an international city.

3:22:59.760 --> 3:23:03.920
 I'm a big believer in the idea of breadth of experience,

3:23:03.920 --> 3:23:07.520
 and if you want, breadth of experience

3:23:07.520 --> 3:23:09.800
 usually requires extensive travel,

3:23:09.800 --> 3:23:14.240
 but training people means you have to be in a fixed location

3:23:14.240 --> 3:23:16.600
 working according to a schedule,

3:23:16.600 --> 3:23:21.680
 and those two push in different directions.

3:23:21.680 --> 3:23:23.000
 New York was the compromise

3:23:23.000 --> 3:23:26.480
 where everyone from around the world came there

3:23:26.480 --> 3:23:29.240
 so you had breadth of experience of world culture,

3:23:29.240 --> 3:23:31.360
 but at the same time, you had a fixed location

3:23:31.360 --> 3:23:32.840
 so you could run a training program

3:23:32.840 --> 3:23:34.440
 that produced world champions,

3:23:34.440 --> 3:23:36.080
 so it was the ideal compromise.

3:23:37.520 --> 3:23:40.560
 It was a fascinating thing to teach classes

3:23:40.560 --> 3:23:43.560
 of over 120 people where literally the entire world

3:23:43.560 --> 3:23:45.200
 was represented on the map

3:23:45.200 --> 3:23:48.840
 and go outside and see the same thing.

3:23:48.840 --> 3:23:53.840
 It was truly the world's leading international city.

3:23:54.160 --> 3:23:58.600
 It was like the world's unofficial capital,

3:23:58.600 --> 3:24:00.640
 a fascinating place to live,

3:24:00.640 --> 3:24:03.040
 so I loved it, but the squad hated it.

3:24:03.040 --> 3:24:07.120
 For them, it was like an expensive thing.

3:24:07.120 --> 3:24:08.760
 They never actually lived in Manhattan.

3:24:08.760 --> 3:24:10.880
 They always lived in New Jersey or Long Island,

3:24:10.880 --> 3:24:11.720
 had to commute in,

3:24:11.720 --> 3:24:14.040
 so all they ever saw was the bridges and the tunnels,

3:24:14.040 --> 3:24:16.640
 the expensive daily parking fees.

3:24:16.640 --> 3:24:18.840
 They only saw the worst of New York,

3:24:18.840 --> 3:24:22.600
 and despite my pleas for them to move into Manhattan,

3:24:22.600 --> 3:24:25.640
 they never did, and so they hated it

3:24:25.640 --> 3:24:27.320
 because when all you see of New York

3:24:27.320 --> 3:24:28.560
 is the bridges and the tunnels

3:24:28.560 --> 3:24:32.800
 and the parking garage, that's not a pleasant thing,

3:24:32.800 --> 3:24:35.360
 so I understand where they're coming from,

3:24:35.360 --> 3:24:37.880
 so then when COVID broke out,

3:24:39.760 --> 3:24:44.760
 they wanted to move to Puerto Rico and work there.

3:24:45.720 --> 3:24:50.120
 Now, Puerto Rico is a beautiful alternative to New York.

3:24:50.120 --> 3:24:52.720
 In many ways, it has many advantages over New York.

3:24:52.720 --> 3:24:53.840
 It's physically beautiful.

3:24:53.840 --> 3:24:55.960
 The people are wonderful,

3:24:55.960 --> 3:25:00.960
 and it's just a wonderful place to spend time.

3:25:02.720 --> 3:25:06.360
 Freedom, low taxes, all those kinds of things

3:25:06.360 --> 3:25:08.160
 that Puerto Rico stands for.

3:25:08.160 --> 3:25:10.240
 It's Texas, on the other hand.

3:25:10.240 --> 3:25:11.080
 I know everyone in the squad.

3:25:11.080 --> 3:25:12.160
 It's a compromise, right?

3:25:12.160 --> 3:25:14.200
 Texas is a compromise between those two.

3:25:14.200 --> 3:25:17.000
 Actually, I must say that everyone on the squad,

3:25:17.000 --> 3:25:19.320
 myself included, loves Texas.

3:25:20.640 --> 3:25:21.760
 There's no question about that.

3:25:21.760 --> 3:25:26.760
 I know Gordon loves it, Gary, Craig, Nicky,

3:25:27.160 --> 3:25:29.680
 everyone who comes here just loves Texas.

3:25:29.680 --> 3:25:31.320
 That is incontestable.

3:25:34.160 --> 3:25:37.200
 Of course, in Texas, there's many great cities.

3:25:37.200 --> 3:25:41.040
 Austin has always been one of my favorites.

3:25:41.040 --> 3:25:43.240
 I love Dallas, I love Austin,

3:25:44.720 --> 3:25:49.720
 and it has the advantages of better infrastructure

3:25:49.720 --> 3:25:52.000
 as a place to train.

3:25:52.000 --> 3:25:54.600
 It has a much higher population density

3:25:54.600 --> 3:25:56.720
 so that you could get a larger number

3:25:56.720 --> 3:25:59.120
 of prospective students and form a larger squad.

3:26:01.000 --> 3:26:06.000
 It would definitely be a fantastic place to open up a gym.

3:26:07.040 --> 3:26:09.080
 I couldn't give an answer off the top of my head.

3:26:09.080 --> 3:26:11.600
 It would be a big move if we did make that move,

3:26:12.520 --> 3:26:17.520
 but the basic idea would be very agreeable

3:26:17.520 --> 3:26:19.520
 to everyone on the team, I will say that.

3:26:21.520 --> 3:26:24.080
 Well, I'll just have to call on my Russian connections

3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:25.600
 to threaten the right kind of people,

3:26:25.600 --> 3:26:28.960
 and I definitely would love,

3:26:28.960 --> 3:26:31.120
 the way you approach training,

3:26:31.120 --> 3:26:32.880
 the way you approach the martial arts

3:26:32.880 --> 3:26:37.400
 is something that I deeply admire

3:26:37.400 --> 3:26:38.920
 as a scholar of these arts,

3:26:38.920 --> 3:26:41.240
 so it would be amazing if you do come here,

3:26:41.240 --> 3:26:44.440
 but either way, it'd be amazing to train together.

3:26:44.440 --> 3:26:46.520
 Let me ask a big, ridiculous question.

3:26:46.520 --> 3:26:51.520
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

3:26:53.120 --> 3:26:55.800
 We talked about at the beginning of the conversation

3:26:55.800 --> 3:26:59.040
 about death and the fear of it.

3:27:00.640 --> 3:27:04.320
 The other big question we ask about life is its meaning.

3:27:04.320 --> 3:27:07.080
 Do you think there's a meaning to our existence here

3:27:07.080 --> 3:27:09.720
 on this little spinning ball?

3:27:09.720 --> 3:27:13.600
 That's, you've thrown some powerful questions.

3:27:13.600 --> 3:27:18.600
 That's the most powerful.

3:27:21.440 --> 3:27:23.200
 For most of human existence,

3:27:24.600 --> 3:27:29.280
 the meaning of life was very, very simple, survival.

3:27:30.560 --> 3:27:35.480
 The only thing that humans cared about was just surviving

3:27:35.480 --> 3:27:38.360
 because it was so damn difficult

3:27:38.360 --> 3:27:43.360
 for the early years of human existence on this Earth.

3:27:43.720 --> 3:27:48.720
 If you look at ourselves as biological agents,

3:27:48.840 --> 3:27:52.040
 everything about our body is set up for one mission,

3:27:52.040 --> 3:27:53.160
 and that is survival.

3:27:54.040 --> 3:27:58.880
 Every reflex we have, every element of our structure

3:27:58.880 --> 3:28:01.360
 is just built up on the battle to survive.

3:28:03.320 --> 3:28:05.360
 And then humans did something remarkable.

3:28:05.360 --> 3:28:10.360
 They elevated themselves through the use of technology

3:28:10.680 --> 3:28:14.400
 and social structure to the top of the food chain

3:28:15.920 --> 3:28:20.920
 so that they went from extremely vulnerable.

3:28:20.920 --> 3:28:24.360
 If you take a naked human being alone

3:28:24.360 --> 3:28:26.760
 and put them in the Serengeti Plains in Africa,

3:28:27.720 --> 3:28:29.560
 they're in some deep shit.

3:28:29.560 --> 3:28:33.120
 If you look at a human being as a survival organ,

3:28:33.120 --> 3:28:38.120
 just by itself, naked, they are among the most feeble

3:28:38.960 --> 3:28:41.640
 at that task in the entire animal kingdom.

3:28:46.560 --> 3:28:49.560
 You compare us with predatory animals.

3:28:49.560 --> 3:28:54.560
 We are weak and soft and easily killed.

3:28:57.320 --> 3:29:01.320
 But if you take that same human and put them in the Serengeti

3:29:01.320 --> 3:29:04.800
 human and put them in a group,

3:29:04.800 --> 3:29:07.600
 and you give them basic technology,

3:29:07.600 --> 3:29:12.600
 steel, a spear, a knife,

3:29:14.360 --> 3:29:16.440
 he goes from the bottom of the food chain

3:29:17.440 --> 3:29:19.080
 to pretty much at the top.

3:29:20.760 --> 3:29:25.760
 And so humanity found itself in a crisis

3:29:25.880 --> 3:29:28.680
 that emerged out of its own success.

3:29:28.680 --> 3:29:31.360
 For most of its history, their only interest

3:29:31.360 --> 3:29:33.520
 was the battle to survive, and they did it.

3:29:33.520 --> 3:29:34.920
 I don't know how they did it, but they did it.

3:29:34.920 --> 3:29:38.200
 They got through ice ages, droughts, famines,

3:29:38.200 --> 3:29:40.920
 disease, everything, and they found a way

3:29:40.920 --> 3:29:42.720
 to get to the top of the food chain.

3:29:44.360 --> 3:29:47.760
 And that's where it all got interesting.

3:29:47.760 --> 3:29:51.640
 Because an organism whose only interest was in survival

3:29:51.640 --> 3:29:54.040
 had for the first time in their history

3:29:54.040 --> 3:29:59.040
 a more or less guaranteed survival.

3:29:59.400 --> 3:30:03.520
 And so the big question now is, now what?

3:30:03.520 --> 3:30:04.760
 We survived.

3:30:04.760 --> 3:30:06.280
 There's no more danger.

3:30:06.280 --> 3:30:09.520
 The average human being finds himself in a world now

3:30:09.520 --> 3:30:14.160
 where there's almost zero danger from predatory animals,

3:30:14.160 --> 3:30:18.760
 where getting a meal is the easiest thing ever,

3:30:18.760 --> 3:30:23.600
 where getting to and from work is not problematic at all,

3:30:23.600 --> 3:30:27.880
 where the majority of infectious diseases,

3:30:28.800 --> 3:30:31.280
 medical complaints can be resolved

3:30:31.280 --> 3:30:33.160
 in a hospital fairly easily.

3:30:35.880 --> 3:30:38.320
 And so they start casting their mind around,

3:30:38.320 --> 3:30:40.360
 okay, what do I do now?

3:30:42.080 --> 3:30:47.040
 And so the minute mankind's existence

3:30:47.040 --> 3:30:48.920
 became more or less guaranteed,

3:30:48.920 --> 3:30:53.920
 the problem shift from survival to meaning.

3:30:55.440 --> 3:30:59.840
 And we found ourselves grappling with a whole new issue

3:30:59.840 --> 3:31:02.400
 that had never occurred to our ancient forefathers,

3:31:03.400 --> 3:31:06.600
 but which now becomes one of the centerpieces

3:31:06.600 --> 3:31:07.840
 of our modern lives.

3:31:09.480 --> 3:31:11.640
 I mean, when you look at your own life,

3:31:11.640 --> 3:31:16.640
 when you look back, you think, I did a hell of a good job.

3:31:16.640 --> 3:31:18.960
 You know, Hunter S. Thompson has this line

3:31:18.960 --> 3:31:20.160
 that I often think about,

3:31:21.480 --> 3:31:23.520
 that life should not be a journey to the grave

3:31:23.520 --> 3:31:26.160
 with the intention of arriving safely

3:31:26.160 --> 3:31:29.160
 in a pretty and well preserved body,

3:31:29.160 --> 3:31:33.520
 but rather to skid in roadside in a cloud of smoke,

3:31:33.520 --> 3:31:35.720
 thoroughly used up, totally worn out,

3:31:35.720 --> 3:31:38.680
 and loudly proclaiming, wow, what a ride.

3:31:38.680 --> 3:31:43.200
 Which is the complete opposite of survival.

3:31:43.200 --> 3:31:45.800
 Well, not complete opposite of survival,

3:31:45.800 --> 3:31:49.720
 but basically embracing danger, embracing risk,

3:31:49.720 --> 3:31:53.120
 going big, just living life to the fullest.

3:31:54.120 --> 3:31:55.960
 So within that context,

3:31:57.760 --> 3:32:01.760
 what would make you proud of a life well lived?

3:32:01.760 --> 3:32:03.640
 When you look back, you, John Donahart,

3:32:03.640 --> 3:32:05.680
 looking back at your life.

3:32:05.680 --> 3:32:07.520
 First, I will address that question,

3:32:07.520 --> 3:32:11.120
 but let's first look at why Hunter Thompson could say that.

3:32:11.120 --> 3:32:13.920
 Why Hunter Thompson could say that?

3:32:13.920 --> 3:32:17.200
 Because his life was more or less guaranteed and safe.

3:32:17.200 --> 3:32:20.120
 If you look at animals in the animal kingdom,

3:32:20.120 --> 3:32:22.160
 the pattern of their life is very simple.

3:32:22.160 --> 3:32:26.040
 They take the least risk possible to secure their existence.

3:32:26.040 --> 3:32:29.880
 Lions are powerful creatures, but when they go hunting,

3:32:29.880 --> 3:32:32.880
 they typically go for the weakest animals they can kill

3:32:32.880 --> 3:32:33.720
 in order to eat,

3:32:33.720 --> 3:32:34.880
 because they don't want to take the risk

3:32:34.880 --> 3:32:38.600
 of injuring themselves, knowing that if they do, they die.

3:32:38.600 --> 3:32:41.160
 So the brute reality is the only people

3:32:41.160 --> 3:32:46.160
 who can talk about having casual danger in their lives

3:32:46.920 --> 3:32:48.840
 are those whose lives are guaranteed.

3:32:48.840 --> 3:32:51.520
 And a fascinating small tangent,

3:32:51.520 --> 3:32:53.440
 Hunter Thompson took his own life.

3:32:54.560 --> 3:32:58.120
 So that seems like a deeply human thing, suicide.

3:32:58.120 --> 3:32:58.960
 Yes.

3:33:00.560 --> 3:33:03.320
 That's a fascinating question in itself.

3:33:03.320 --> 3:33:07.080
 If you look at the number of suicides per year,

3:33:07.080 --> 3:33:09.000
 it's a shocking, shocking statistic

3:33:09.000 --> 3:33:11.080
 that gets almost no recognition.

3:33:11.080 --> 3:33:12.680
 And yes, uniquely human.

3:33:12.680 --> 3:33:16.000
 You don't, very, very few animals, you see,

3:33:16.000 --> 3:33:17.680
 killing themselves because their whole thing

3:33:17.680 --> 3:33:18.800
 is just survival.

3:33:18.800 --> 3:33:20.640
 And that humans paradoxically,

3:33:20.640 --> 3:33:22.560
 when survival is more or less guaranteed,

3:33:22.560 --> 3:33:24.640
 are killing themselves in vast numbers.

3:33:24.640 --> 3:33:28.120
 It's usually linked back to the idea of meaning

3:33:28.120 --> 3:33:30.480
 because it's so hard.

3:33:30.480 --> 3:33:34.640
 It was hard to win the battle for survival,

3:33:34.640 --> 3:33:37.600
 but it's 10 times harder to win the battle for meaning.

3:33:42.880 --> 3:33:44.880
 When I think about it,

3:33:44.880 --> 3:33:46.600
 first off, I'll say right from the bat,

3:33:46.600 --> 3:33:51.600
 there's never going to be an agreed upon sense of meaning.

3:33:53.800 --> 3:33:55.280
 As I said, there was one thing

3:33:55.280 --> 3:33:57.880
 that our physical bodies agreed upon

3:33:57.880 --> 3:34:00.600
 and which is hardwired biologically into us

3:34:00.600 --> 3:34:01.760
 and that's survival.

3:34:01.760 --> 3:34:05.000
 But once we got to a more or less guaranteed survival,

3:34:05.000 --> 3:34:06.040
 then all bets were off.

3:34:06.040 --> 3:34:09.400
 At that point, you just have to start

3:34:09.400 --> 3:34:10.840
 listing your own criteria

3:34:10.840 --> 3:34:13.360
 and what one person will describe as a meaningful life,

3:34:13.360 --> 3:34:17.560
 another person will decry as meaningless or wasted.

3:34:21.760 --> 3:34:24.760
 There's something terrible about the idea

3:34:24.760 --> 3:34:27.440
 that we're sitting around waiting for meaning

3:34:27.440 --> 3:34:29.200
 to show up on our doorstep.

3:34:29.200 --> 3:34:30.960
 But what I find the best people do

3:34:30.960 --> 3:34:32.040
 is they take charge of it

3:34:32.040 --> 3:34:36.880
 and they look at their lives in a form of authorship

3:34:36.880 --> 3:34:41.400
 where they see their life as a tale to be written

3:34:41.400 --> 3:34:44.320
 and they do their best to write that tale

3:34:44.320 --> 3:34:48.720
 and put as much control over the direction of the story

3:34:48.720 --> 3:34:49.640
 as they can.

3:34:52.520 --> 3:34:57.040
 In the end, we all have to just try and write our own story.

3:34:57.040 --> 3:34:59.040
 We all have our own interests.

3:34:59.040 --> 3:35:04.040
 I try to bring in the sense that even though I'm an atheist,

3:35:05.800 --> 3:35:09.160
 I don't believe that we go on to live after this.

3:35:09.160 --> 3:35:13.840
 I believe that there's a possibility of God in an afterlife.

3:35:13.840 --> 3:35:15.520
 I don't say it's impossible,

3:35:15.520 --> 3:35:18.440
 but in order for me to believe that they exist,

3:35:18.440 --> 3:35:21.200
 I'd have to see better evidence than I see currently.

3:35:22.840 --> 3:35:26.840
 Nonetheless, I do believe that there is a great value

3:35:26.840 --> 3:35:31.160
 in the idea of living for something bigger than yourself.

3:35:31.160 --> 3:35:34.520
 The moment you see yourself as the be all

3:35:34.520 --> 3:35:36.400
 and end all of your existence,

3:35:36.400 --> 3:35:38.200
 you're in for a meaningless life

3:35:38.200 --> 3:35:40.200
 and nothing will ever satisfy you.

3:35:40.200 --> 3:35:41.600
 You can have all the money in the world.

3:35:41.600 --> 3:35:42.800
 You can have all the power in the world.

3:35:42.800 --> 3:35:44.160
 You'll be empty inside.

3:35:45.040 --> 3:35:49.920
 I do believe that humans have a deep and abiding need

3:35:51.000 --> 3:35:53.880
 to follow the interests of a group

3:35:53.880 --> 3:35:57.440
 bigger than themselves as an individual.

3:35:57.440 --> 3:35:58.440
 Is it ideal?

3:35:58.440 --> 3:35:59.280
 No.

3:35:59.280 --> 3:36:00.920
 Is it an answer to the meaning of life?

3:36:00.920 --> 3:36:03.520
 Nope, because eventually that group will itself die out.

3:36:03.520 --> 3:36:06.640
 So there's a sense in which it just plays

3:36:06.640 --> 3:36:07.880
 a kind of delaying game.

3:36:10.920 --> 3:36:15.680
 But I do believe that in order to live a happy life,

3:36:17.120 --> 3:36:19.280
 meaning is a central part of that.

3:36:19.280 --> 3:36:21.080
 And the deepest sense of meaning,

3:36:21.080 --> 3:36:24.720
 not a fully complete answer, but a better answer

3:36:24.720 --> 3:36:28.200
 than most people give is to find something

3:36:28.200 --> 3:36:31.400
 which hopefully does very little harm

3:36:31.400 --> 3:36:34.720
 to the people around you and mostly benefits them,

3:36:34.720 --> 3:36:38.440
 which enables you to become part of a community

3:36:38.440 --> 3:36:42.000
 and to live, as I said,

3:36:42.000 --> 3:36:44.880
 for something larger than you as an individual.

3:36:46.960 --> 3:36:50.080
 If there is such a thing as a perfect conversation,

3:36:50.080 --> 3:36:55.080
 it would be a conversation on death, meaning, and robots

3:36:56.920 --> 3:36:58.920
 with the great John Donoher.

3:36:58.920 --> 3:37:00.600
 John, I've been a fan.

3:37:01.520 --> 3:37:04.560
 It's a huge honor that you would waste all your time today.

3:37:04.560 --> 3:37:05.720
 Thank you so much for talking today.

3:37:05.720 --> 3:37:06.560
 My pleasure.

3:37:06.560 --> 3:37:08.040
 Thank you, Lynx.

3:37:08.040 --> 3:37:09.560
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

3:37:09.560 --> 3:37:12.640
 with John Donoher, and thank you to Onnit,

3:37:12.640 --> 3:37:15.720
 SimplySafe, Indeed, and Linode.

3:37:15.720 --> 3:37:19.200
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

3:37:19.200 --> 3:37:21.320
 And now let me leave you some words

3:37:21.320 --> 3:37:23.560
 from John Donoher himself.

3:37:23.560 --> 3:37:27.800
 In fighting and competition, the objective is victory.

3:37:27.800 --> 3:37:31.280
 In training, the objective is skill development.

3:37:31.280 --> 3:37:33.080
 Do not confuse them.

3:37:33.080 --> 3:37:35.160
 As such, one of the best ways to train

3:37:35.160 --> 3:37:38.600
 is to identify the strengths of your various partners

3:37:38.600 --> 3:37:41.600
 and regularly expose yourself to those strengths.

3:37:41.600 --> 3:37:53.600
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
