00:00.000 --> 00:02.920
 The following is a conversation with David Chalmers.

00:02.920 --> 00:05.360
 He's a philosopher and cognitive scientist

00:05.360 --> 00:08.080
 specializing in the areas of philosophy of mind,

00:08.080 --> 00:11.040
 philosophy of language, and consciousness.

00:11.040 --> 00:13.320
 He's perhaps best known for formulating

00:13.320 --> 00:15.160
 the hard problem of consciousness,

00:15.160 --> 00:17.720
 which could be stated as why does the feeling

00:17.720 --> 00:20.160
 which accompanies awareness of sensory information

00:20.160 --> 00:21.720
 exist at all?

00:22.720 --> 00:25.520
 Consciousness is almost entirely a mystery.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.640
 Many people who worry about AI safety and ethics

00:28.640 --> 00:31.840
 believe that, in some form, consciousness can

00:31.840 --> 00:35.480
 and should be engineered into AI systems of the future.

00:35.480 --> 00:38.360
 So while there's much mystery, disagreement,

00:38.360 --> 00:40.920
 discoveries yet to be made about consciousness,

00:40.920 --> 00:44.360
 these conversations, while fundamentally philosophical

00:44.360 --> 00:47.200
 in nature, may nevertheless be very important

00:47.200 --> 00:50.300
 for engineers of modern AI systems to engage in.

00:51.140 --> 00:53.900
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

00:53.900 --> 00:56.200
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

00:56.200 --> 00:58.000
 give it five stars on Apple Podcast,

00:58.000 --> 01:00.360
 support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me

01:00.360 --> 01:04.520
 on Twitter at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

01:05.480 --> 01:08.360
 As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now

01:08.360 --> 01:09.680
 and never any ads in the middle

01:09.680 --> 01:11.920
 that can break the flow of the conversation.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.240
 I hope that works for you

01:13.240 --> 01:15.600
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.560
 This show is presented by Cash App,

01:17.560 --> 01:19.840
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

01:19.840 --> 01:23.280
 When you get it, use code LEXBODCAST.

01:23.280 --> 01:25.480
 Cash App lets you send money to friends,

01:25.480 --> 01:27.920
 buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market

01:27.920 --> 01:29.880
 with as little as one dollar.

01:29.880 --> 01:32.640
 Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing,

01:32.640 --> 01:36.000
 subsidiary of Square, and member SIPC.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.320
 Since Cash App does fractional share trading,

01:38.320 --> 01:40.880
 let me mention that the order execution algorithm

01:40.880 --> 01:43.600
 that works behind the scenes to create the abstraction

01:43.600 --> 01:46.760
 of fractional orders is an algorithmic marvel.

01:46.760 --> 01:49.200
 So big props to the Cash App engineers

01:49.200 --> 01:51.640
 for solving a hard problem that, in the end,

01:51.640 --> 01:54.240
 provides an easy interface that takes a step up

01:54.240 --> 01:57.120
 to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market,

01:57.120 --> 01:59.960
 making trading more accessible for new investors

01:59.960 --> 02:02.800
 and diversification much easier.

02:02.800 --> 02:05.160
 If you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play

02:05.160 --> 02:08.840
 and use the code LEXBODCAST, you'll get $10,

02:08.840 --> 02:11.680
 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,

02:11.680 --> 02:13.480
 one of my favorite organizations

02:13.480 --> 02:16.680
 that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education

02:16.680 --> 02:18.680
 for young people around the world.

02:18.680 --> 02:22.200
 And now, here's my conversation with David Chalmers.

02:23.160 --> 02:25.960
 Do you think we're living in a simulation?

02:25.960 --> 02:27.440
 I don't rule it out.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.720
 There's probably gonna be a lot of simulations

02:29.720 --> 02:31.240
 in the history of the cosmos.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.720
 If the simulation is designed well enough,

02:34.720 --> 02:39.720
 it'll be indistinguishable from a non simulated reality.

02:39.800 --> 02:43.200
 And although we could keep searching for evidence

02:43.200 --> 02:46.000
 that we're not in a simulation,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.600
 any of that evidence in principle could be simulated.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.560
 So I think it's a possibility.

02:50.560 --> 02:53.000
 But do you think the thought experiment is interesting

02:53.000 --> 02:56.480
 or useful to calibrate how we think

02:56.480 --> 02:58.720
 about the nature of reality?

02:58.720 --> 03:01.000
 Yeah, I definitely think it's interesting and useful.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.640
 In fact, I'm actually writing a book about this right now,

03:03.640 --> 03:05.960
 all about the simulation idea,

03:05.960 --> 03:07.160
 using it to shed light

03:07.160 --> 03:10.320
 on a whole bunch of philosophical questions.

03:10.320 --> 03:13.120
 So the big one is how do we know anything

03:13.120 --> 03:15.520
 about the external world?

03:15.520 --> 03:19.440
 Descartes said, maybe you're being fooled by an evil demon

03:19.440 --> 03:21.840
 who's stimulating your brain into thinking,

03:21.840 --> 03:25.840
 all this stuff is real when in fact, it's all made up.

03:25.840 --> 03:28.080
 Well, the modern version of that is,

03:28.080 --> 03:30.840
 how do you know you're not in a simulation?

03:30.840 --> 03:33.680
 Then the thought is, if you're in a simulation,

03:33.680 --> 03:34.560
 none of this is real.

03:34.560 --> 03:37.560
 So that's teaching you something about knowledge.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.440
 How do you know about the external world?

03:39.440 --> 03:41.080
 I think there's also really interesting questions

03:41.080 --> 03:43.840
 about the nature of reality right here.

03:43.840 --> 03:46.840
 If we are in a simulation, is all this real?

03:46.840 --> 03:48.120
 Is there really a table here?

03:48.120 --> 03:49.240
 Is it really a microphone?

03:49.240 --> 03:50.800
 Do I really have a body?

03:50.800 --> 03:54.160
 The standard view would be, no, we don't.

03:54.160 --> 03:55.560
 None of this would be real.

03:55.560 --> 03:56.840
 My view is actually that's wrong.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.360
 And even if we are in a simulation, all of this is real.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.400
 That's why I called this reality 2.0.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.120
 New version of reality, different version of reality,

04:04.120 --> 04:05.400
 still reality.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.440
 So what's the difference between quote unquote,

04:08.440 --> 04:12.520
 real world and the world that we perceive?

04:12.520 --> 04:17.160
 So we interact with the world by perceiving it.

04:17.160 --> 04:22.160
 It only really exists through the window

04:22.960 --> 04:25.840
 of our perception system and in our mind.

04:25.840 --> 04:27.400
 So what's the difference between something

04:27.400 --> 04:30.440
 that's quote unquote real, that exists perhaps

04:30.440 --> 04:35.440
 without us being there, and the world as you perceive it?

04:36.440 --> 04:39.160
 Well the world as we perceive it is a very simplified

04:39.160 --> 04:42.800
 and distorted version of what's going on underneath.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.240
 We already know that from just thinking about science.

04:45.240 --> 04:48.800
 You don't see too many obviously quantum mechanical effects

04:48.800 --> 04:51.680
 in what we perceive, but we still know quantum mechanics

04:51.680 --> 04:53.720
 is going on under all things.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.320
 So I like to think the world we perceive

04:55.320 --> 05:00.320
 is this very kind of simplified picture of colors

05:00.920 --> 05:04.640
 and shapes existing in space and so on.

05:04.640 --> 05:07.080
 We know there's a, that's what the philosopher

05:07.080 --> 05:09.760
 Wilfred Sellers called the manifest image.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.560
 The world as it seems to us, we already know

05:11.560 --> 05:14.720
 underneath all that is a very different scientific image

05:14.720 --> 05:19.520
 with atoms or quantum wave functions or super strings

05:19.520 --> 05:22.360
 or whatever the latest thing is.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.880
 And that's the ultimate scientific reality.

05:24.880 --> 05:28.400
 So I think of the simulation idea as basically

05:28.400 --> 05:31.080
 another hypothesis about what the ultimate

05:31.080 --> 05:34.480
 say quasi scientific or metaphysical reality

05:34.480 --> 05:37.680
 is going on underneath the world of the manifest image.

05:37.680 --> 05:41.280
 The world of the manifest image is this very simple thing

05:41.280 --> 05:43.240
 that we interact with that's neutral

05:43.240 --> 05:46.480
 on the underlying stuff of reality.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.880
 Science can help tell us about that.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.400
 Maybe philosophy can help tell us about that too.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.400
 And if we eventually take the red pill

05:53.400 --> 05:54.880
 and find out we're in a simulation,

05:54.880 --> 05:56.760
 my view is that's just another view

05:56.760 --> 05:58.760
 about what reality is made of.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.960
 The philosopher Immanuel Kant said,

06:00.960 --> 06:02.760
 what is the nature of the thing in itself?

06:02.760 --> 06:05.400
 I've got a glass here and it's got all these,

06:05.400 --> 06:07.960
 it appears to me a certain way, a certain shape,

06:07.960 --> 06:10.200
 it's liquid, it's clear.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.080
 And he said, what is the nature of the thing

06:13.080 --> 06:14.160
 in itself?

06:14.160 --> 06:15.480
 Well, I think of the simulation idea,

06:15.480 --> 06:18.640
 it's a hypothesis about the nature of the thing in itself.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.560
 It turns out if we're in a simulation,

06:20.560 --> 06:22.640
 the thing in itself nature of this glass,

06:22.640 --> 06:25.000
 it's okay, it's actually a bunch of data structures

06:25.000 --> 06:28.360
 running on a computer in the next universe up.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.320
 Yeah, that's what people tend to do

06:30.320 --> 06:31.560
 when they think about simulation.

06:31.560 --> 06:34.520
 They think about our modern computers

06:34.520 --> 06:39.520
 and somehow trivially crudely just scaled up in some sense.

06:39.520 --> 06:44.440
 But do you think the simulation,

06:44.440 --> 06:47.520
 I mean, in order to actually simulate

06:47.520 --> 06:50.400
 something as complicated as our universe

06:50.400 --> 06:53.040
 that's made up of molecules and atoms

06:53.040 --> 06:57.200
 and particles and quarks and maybe even strings,

06:57.200 --> 06:59.160
 all of that would require something

06:59.160 --> 07:03.280
 just infinitely many orders of magnitude more

07:03.280 --> 07:06.160
 of scale and complexity.

07:06.160 --> 07:11.160
 Do you think we're even able to even like conceptualize

07:12.280 --> 07:16.000
 what it would take to simulate our universe?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.680
 Or does it just slip into this idea

07:18.680 --> 07:21.600
 that you basically have to build a universe,

07:21.600 --> 07:24.360
 something so big to simulate it?

07:24.360 --> 07:26.960
 Does it get this into this fuzzy area

07:26.960 --> 07:28.840
 that's not useful at all?

07:28.840 --> 07:30.720
 Yeah, well, I mean, our universe

07:30.720 --> 07:33.280
 is obviously incredibly complicated.

07:33.280 --> 07:37.640
 And for us within our universe to build a simulation

07:37.640 --> 07:40.680
 of a universe as complicated as ours

07:40.680 --> 07:42.360
 is gonna have obvious problems here.

07:42.360 --> 07:44.000
 If the universe is finite,

07:44.000 --> 07:45.720
 there's just no way that's gonna work.

07:45.720 --> 07:48.040
 Maybe there's some cute way to make it work

07:48.040 --> 07:51.160
 if the universe is infinite,

07:51.160 --> 07:53.600
 maybe an infinite universe could somehow simulate

07:53.600 --> 07:57.120
 a copy of itself, but that's gonna be hard.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.760
 Nonetheless, just that we are in a simulation,

07:59.760 --> 08:01.080
 I think there's no particular reason

08:01.080 --> 08:04.000
 why we have to think the simulating universe

08:04.000 --> 08:06.160
 has to be anything like ours.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.000
 You've said before that it might be,

08:09.960 --> 08:12.640
 so you could think of it in turtles all the way down.

08:12.640 --> 08:15.800
 You could think of the simulating universe

08:15.800 --> 08:17.720
 different than ours, but we ourselves

08:17.720 --> 08:20.240
 could also create another simulating universe.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.640
 So you said that there could be these

08:21.640 --> 08:24.160
 kind of levels of universes.

08:24.160 --> 08:27.080
 And you've also mentioned this hilarious idea,

08:27.080 --> 08:29.080
 maybe tongue in cheek, maybe not,

08:29.080 --> 08:31.800
 that there may be simulations within simulations,

08:31.800 --> 08:33.840
 arbitrarily stacked levels,

08:33.840 --> 08:37.760
 and that there may be, that we may be in level 42.

08:37.760 --> 08:38.600
 Oh yeah.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.640
 Along those stacks, referencing Hitchhiker's Guide

08:40.640 --> 08:41.800
 to the Universe.

08:41.800 --> 08:45.840
 If we're indeed in a simulation within a simulation

08:45.840 --> 08:50.840
 at level 42, what do you think level zero looks like?

08:51.520 --> 08:52.360
 The originating universe.

08:52.360 --> 08:55.160
 I would expect that level zero is truly enormous.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.680
 I mean, not just, if it's finite,

08:57.680 --> 09:01.800
 at some extraordinarily large finite capacity,

09:01.800 --> 09:03.160
 much more likely it's infinite.

09:03.160 --> 09:06.800
 Maybe it's got some very high cardinality

09:06.800 --> 09:11.360
 that enables it to support just any number of simulations.

09:11.360 --> 09:14.360
 So high degree of infinity at level zero,

09:14.360 --> 09:18.880
 slightly smaller degree of infinity at level one.

09:18.880 --> 09:21.480
 So by the time you get down to us at level 42,

09:21.480 --> 09:25.080
 maybe there's plenty of room for lots of simulations

09:25.080 --> 09:27.800
 of finite capacity.

09:29.280 --> 09:34.280
 If the top universe is only a small finite capacity,

09:34.360 --> 09:36.960
 then obviously that's gonna put very, very serious limits

09:36.960 --> 09:40.280
 on how many simulations you're gonna be able to get running.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.720
 So I think we can certainly confidently say

09:42.720 --> 09:44.320
 that if we're at level 42,

09:44.320 --> 09:47.120
 then the top level's pretty damn big.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.120
 So it gets more and more constrained

09:49.120 --> 09:52.200
 as we get down levels, more and more simplified

09:52.200 --> 09:54.600
 and constrained and limited in resources.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.560
 Yeah, we still have plenty of capacity here.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.320
 What was it Feynman said?

09:58.320 --> 10:01.040
 He said there's plenty of room at the bottom.

10:01.040 --> 10:04.600
 We're still a number of levels above the degree

10:04.600 --> 10:06.960
 where there's room for fundamental computing,

10:06.960 --> 10:08.400
 physical computing capacity,

10:08.400 --> 10:11.080
 quantum computing capacity at the bottom level.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.440
 So we've got plenty of room to play with

10:13.440 --> 10:15.520
 and we probably have plenty of room

10:15.520 --> 10:19.120
 for simulations of pretty sophisticated universes,

10:19.120 --> 10:22.800
 perhaps none as complicated as our universe,

10:22.800 --> 10:25.280
 unless our universe is infinite,

10:25.280 --> 10:27.280
 but still at the very least

10:27.280 --> 10:29.160
 for pretty serious finite universes,

10:29.160 --> 10:31.800
 but maybe universes somewhat simpler than ours,

10:31.800 --> 10:35.200
 unless of course we're prepared to take certain shortcuts

10:35.200 --> 10:36.080
 in the simulation,

10:36.080 --> 10:38.720
 which might then increase the capacity significantly.

10:38.720 --> 10:42.240
 Do you think the human mind, us people,

10:42.240 --> 10:44.700
 in terms of the complexity of simulation

10:44.700 --> 10:47.240
 is at the height of what the simulation

10:47.240 --> 10:48.620
 might be able to achieve?

10:48.620 --> 10:51.280
 Like if you look at incredible entities

10:51.280 --> 10:54.920
 that could be created in this universe of ours,

10:54.920 --> 10:56.840
 do you have an intuition about

10:56.840 --> 11:00.600
 how incredible human beings are on that scale?

11:00.600 --> 11:02.400
 I think we're pretty impressive,

11:02.400 --> 11:03.920
 but we're not that impressive.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.040
 Are we above average?

11:06.040 --> 11:09.020
 I mean, I think human beings are at a certain point

11:09.020 --> 11:11.400
 in the scale of intelligence,

11:11.400 --> 11:14.280
 which made many things possible.

11:14.280 --> 11:19.280
 You get through evolution, through single cell organisms,

11:19.280 --> 11:22.720
 through fish and mammals and primates,

11:22.720 --> 11:24.160
 and something happens.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.800
 Once you get to human beings,

11:25.800 --> 11:27.600
 we've just reached that level

11:27.600 --> 11:29.460
 where we get to develop language,

11:29.460 --> 11:31.600
 we get to develop certain kinds of culture,

11:31.600 --> 11:34.920
 and we get to develop certain kinds of collective thinking

11:34.920 --> 11:38.380
 that has enabled all this amazing stuff to happen,

11:38.380 --> 11:40.800
 science and literature and engineering

11:40.800 --> 11:43.680
 and culture and so on.

11:43.680 --> 11:46.160
 So we had just at the beginning of that

11:46.160 --> 11:47.640
 on the evolutionary threshold,

11:47.640 --> 11:49.720
 it's kind of like we just got there,

11:49.720 --> 11:54.440
 who knows, a few thousand or tens of thousands of years ago.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.460
 So we're probably just at the very beginning

11:56.460 --> 11:57.720
 for what's possible there.

11:57.720 --> 12:01.080
 So I'm inclined to think among the scale

12:01.080 --> 12:02.400
 of intelligent beings,

12:02.400 --> 12:05.140
 we're somewhere very near the bottom.

12:05.140 --> 12:06.320
 I would expect that, for example,

12:06.320 --> 12:08.800
 if we're in a simulation,

12:08.800 --> 12:10.960
 then the simulators who created us

12:10.960 --> 12:14.000
 have got the capacity to be far more sophisticated.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.400
 If we're at level 42,

12:15.400 --> 12:17.760
 who knows what the ones at level zero are like.

12:19.120 --> 12:22.760
 It's also possible that this is the epitome

12:22.760 --> 12:24.540
 of what is possible to achieve.

12:24.540 --> 12:27.320
 So we as human beings see ourselves maybe as flawed,

12:27.320 --> 12:29.720
 see all the constraints, all the limitations,

12:29.720 --> 12:32.400
 but maybe that's the magical, the beautiful thing.

12:32.400 --> 12:36.020
 Maybe those limitations are the essential elements

12:36.020 --> 12:39.020
 for an interesting sort of that edge of chaos,

12:39.020 --> 12:41.040
 that interesting existence,

12:41.040 --> 12:43.380
 that if you make us much more intelligent,

12:43.380 --> 12:46.980
 if you make us much more powerful

12:46.980 --> 12:50.360
 in any kind of dimension of performance,

12:50.360 --> 12:52.540
 maybe you lose something fundamental

12:52.540 --> 12:55.120
 that makes life worth living.

12:55.120 --> 12:57.940
 So you kind of have this optimistic view

12:57.940 --> 13:00.140
 that we're this little baby,

13:00.140 --> 13:03.020
 that then there's so much growth and potential,

13:03.020 --> 13:05.820
 but this could also be it.

13:05.820 --> 13:09.620
 This is the most amazing thing is us.

13:09.620 --> 13:11.260
 Maybe what you're saying is consistent

13:11.260 --> 13:12.100
 with what I'm saying.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.420
 I mean, we could still have levels of intelligence

13:14.420 --> 13:15.700
 far beyond us,

13:15.700 --> 13:17.740
 but maybe those levels of intelligence on your view

13:17.740 --> 13:19.020
 would be kind of boring.

13:19.020 --> 13:21.440
 And we kind of get so good at everything

13:21.440 --> 13:24.240
 that life suddenly becomes uni dimensional.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.900
 So we're just inhabiting this one spot

13:26.900 --> 13:30.740
 of like maximal romanticism in the history of evolution.

13:30.740 --> 13:32.180
 You get to humans and it's like, yeah,

13:32.180 --> 13:34.980
 and then years to come, our super intelligent descendants

13:34.980 --> 13:37.580
 are gonna look back at us and say,

13:37.580 --> 13:39.740
 those were the days when they just hit

13:39.740 --> 13:42.580
 the point of inflection and life was interesting.

13:42.580 --> 13:43.420
 I am an optimist.

13:43.420 --> 13:47.100
 So I'd like to think that if there is super intelligent

13:47.100 --> 13:49.420
 somewhere in the future,

13:49.420 --> 13:51.860
 they'll figure out how to make life super interesting

13:51.860 --> 13:52.940
 and super romantic.

13:52.940 --> 13:54.600
 Well, you know what they're gonna do.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.460
 So what they're gonna do is they realize

13:56.460 --> 13:58.740
 how boring life is when you're super intelligent.

13:58.740 --> 14:02.580
 So they create a new level of assimilation

14:02.580 --> 14:05.740
 and sort of live through the things they've created

14:05.740 --> 14:09.220
 by watching them stumble about

14:09.220 --> 14:10.500
 in their flawed ways.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.780
 So maybe that's, so you create a new level of assimilation

14:13.780 --> 14:17.860
 every time you get really bored with how smart and.

14:17.860 --> 14:19.060
 This would be kind of sad though,

14:19.060 --> 14:20.780
 because if we showed the peak of their existence

14:20.780 --> 14:23.420
 would be like watching simulations for entertainment.

14:23.420 --> 14:26.540
 Not like saying the peak of our existence now is Netflix.

14:26.540 --> 14:27.660
 No, it's all right.

14:27.660 --> 14:31.180
 A flip side of that could be the peak of our existence

14:31.180 --> 14:34.260
 for many people having children and watching them grow.

14:34.260 --> 14:35.780
 That becomes very meaningful.

14:35.780 --> 14:38.580
 Okay, you create a simulation that's like creating a family.

14:38.580 --> 14:40.860
 Creating like, well, any kind of creation

14:40.860 --> 14:43.780
 is kind of a powerful act.

14:43.780 --> 14:46.220
 Do you think it's easier to simulate the mind

14:46.220 --> 14:47.760
 or the universe?

14:47.760 --> 14:51.960
 So I've heard several people, including Nick Bostrom,

14:51.960 --> 14:54.620
 think about ideas of maybe you don't need

14:54.620 --> 14:55.600
 to simulate the universe,

14:55.600 --> 14:57.440
 you can just simulate the human mind.

14:57.440 --> 15:00.380
 Or in general, just the distinction

15:00.380 --> 15:02.600
 between simulating the entirety of it,

15:02.600 --> 15:04.600
 the entirety of the physical world,

15:04.600 --> 15:06.080
 or just simulating the mind.

15:06.080 --> 15:09.740
 Which one do you see as more challenging?

15:09.740 --> 15:12.380
 Well, I think in some sense, the answer is obvious.

15:12.380 --> 15:15.060
 It has to be simpler to simulate the mind

15:15.060 --> 15:16.500
 than to simulate the universe,

15:16.500 --> 15:18.500
 because the mind is part of the universe.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.540
 And in order to fully simulate the universe,

15:20.540 --> 15:22.620
 you're gonna have to simulate the mind.

15:22.620 --> 15:25.320
 So unless we're talking about partial simulations.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.580
 And I guess the question is which comes first?

15:27.580 --> 15:29.800
 Does the mind come before the universe

15:29.800 --> 15:32.560
 or does the universe come before the mind?

15:32.560 --> 15:36.620
 So the mind could just be an emergent phenomena

15:36.620 --> 15:37.960
 in this universe.

15:37.960 --> 15:42.020
 So simulation is an interesting thing

15:42.020 --> 15:47.020
 that it's not like creating a simulation perhaps

15:47.380 --> 15:50.380
 requires you to program every single thing

15:50.380 --> 15:51.780
 that happens in it.

15:51.780 --> 15:54.220
 It's just defining a set of initial conditions

15:54.220 --> 15:57.820
 and rules based on which it behaves.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.940
 Simulating the mind requires you

16:01.940 --> 16:03.840
 to have a little bit more,

16:05.160 --> 16:07.300
 we're now in a little bit of a crazy land,

16:07.300 --> 16:10.260
 but it requires you to understand

16:10.260 --> 16:11.840
 the fundamentals of cognition,

16:11.840 --> 16:13.660
 perhaps of consciousness,

16:13.660 --> 16:16.640
 of perception of everything like that,

16:16.640 --> 16:21.640
 that's not created through some kind of emergence

16:23.340 --> 16:25.880
 from basic physics laws,

16:25.880 --> 16:27.940
 but more requires you to actually understand

16:27.940 --> 16:29.820
 the fundamentals of the mind.

16:29.820 --> 16:31.660
 How about if we said to simulate the brain?

16:31.660 --> 16:32.500
 The brain.

16:32.500 --> 16:33.940
 Rather than the mind.

16:33.940 --> 16:36.060
 So the brain is just a big physical system.

16:36.060 --> 16:38.620
 The universe is a giant physical system.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.100
 To simulate the universe at the very least,

16:40.100 --> 16:42.640
 you're gonna have to simulate the brains

16:42.640 --> 16:46.140
 as well as all the other physical systems within it.

16:46.140 --> 16:50.920
 And it's not obvious that the problems are any worse

16:50.920 --> 16:53.580
 for the brain than for,

16:53.580 --> 16:56.040
 it's a particularly complex physical system.

16:56.040 --> 16:58.600
 But if we can simulate arbitrary physical systems,

16:58.600 --> 16:59.880
 we can simulate brains.

16:59.880 --> 17:02.100
 There is this further question of whether,

17:02.100 --> 17:03.980
 when you simulate a brain,

17:03.980 --> 17:07.340
 will that bring along all the features of the mind with it?

17:07.340 --> 17:08.880
 Like will you get consciousness?

17:08.880 --> 17:09.980
 Will you get thinking?

17:09.980 --> 17:11.600
 Will you get free will?

17:11.600 --> 17:12.540
 And so on.

17:12.540 --> 17:16.200
 And that's something philosophers have argued over

17:16.200 --> 17:17.060
 for years.

17:17.060 --> 17:20.060
 My own view is if you simulate the brain well enough,

17:20.060 --> 17:22.620
 that will also simulate the mind.

17:22.620 --> 17:24.860
 But yeah, there's plenty of people who would say no.

17:24.860 --> 17:27.140
 You'd merely get like a zombie system,

17:27.140 --> 17:31.300
 a simulation of a brain without any true consciousness.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.420
 But for you, you put together a brain,

17:33.420 --> 17:36.320
 the consciousness comes with it, arise.

17:36.320 --> 17:38.640
 Yeah, I don't think it's obvious.

17:38.640 --> 17:39.660
 That's your intuition.

17:39.660 --> 17:41.320
 My view is roughly that yeah,

17:41.320 --> 17:43.100
 what is responsible for consciousness,

17:43.100 --> 17:46.960
 it's in the patterns of information processing and so on

17:46.960 --> 17:50.460
 rather than say the biology that it's made of.

17:50.460 --> 17:51.780
 There's certainly plenty of people out there

17:51.780 --> 17:54.520
 who think consciousness has to be say biological.

17:54.520 --> 17:57.300
 So if you merely replicate the patterns of information

17:57.300 --> 17:59.680
 processing in a nonbiological substrate,

17:59.680 --> 18:02.440
 you'll miss what's crucial for consciousness.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.320
 I mean, I just don't think there's any particular reason

18:04.320 --> 18:07.380
 to think that biology is special here.

18:07.380 --> 18:09.620
 You can imagine substituting the biology

18:09.620 --> 18:13.700
 for nonbiological systems, say silicon circuits

18:13.700 --> 18:15.120
 that play the same role.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.620
 The behavior will continue to be the same.

18:17.620 --> 18:21.300
 And I think just thinking about what is the true,

18:21.300 --> 18:22.300
 when I think about the connection,

18:22.300 --> 18:25.540
 the isomorphisms between consciousness and the brain,

18:25.540 --> 18:28.300
 the deepest connections to me seem to connect consciousness

18:28.300 --> 18:30.300
 to patterns of information processing,

18:30.300 --> 18:32.380
 not to specific biology.

18:32.380 --> 18:35.180
 So I at least adopted as my working hypothesis

18:35.180 --> 18:38.180
 that basically it's the computation and the information

18:38.180 --> 18:39.580
 that matters for consciousness.

18:39.580 --> 18:41.820
 Same time, we don't understand consciousness,

18:41.820 --> 18:43.700
 so all this could be wrong.

18:43.700 --> 18:48.180
 So the computation, the flow, the processing,

18:48.180 --> 18:49.840
 manipulation of information,

18:49.840 --> 18:54.440
 the process is where the consciousness,

18:54.440 --> 18:56.480
 the software is where the consciousness comes from,

18:56.480 --> 18:57.860
 not the hardware.

18:57.860 --> 18:59.200
 Roughly the software, yeah.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.800
 The patterns of information processing at least

19:01.800 --> 19:05.720
 in the hardware, which we could view as software.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.360
 It may not be something you can just like program

19:07.360 --> 19:11.360
 and load and erase and so on in the way we can

19:11.360 --> 19:14.000
 with ordinary software, but it's something at the level

19:14.000 --> 19:16.240
 of information processing rather than at the level

19:16.240 --> 19:17.960
 of implementation.

19:17.960 --> 19:22.480
 So on that, what do you think of the experience of self,

19:22.480 --> 19:26.040
 just the experience of the world in a virtual world,

19:26.040 --> 19:27.920
 in virtual reality?

19:27.920 --> 19:31.400
 Is it possible that we can create sort of

19:33.480 --> 19:36.760
 offsprings of our consciousness by existing

19:36.760 --> 19:38.840
 in a virtual world long enough?

19:38.840 --> 19:43.840
 So yeah, can we be conscious in the same kind

19:44.520 --> 19:47.640
 of deep way that we are in this real world

19:47.640 --> 19:51.120
 by hanging out in a virtual world?

19:51.120 --> 19:54.160
 Yeah, well, the kind of virtual worlds we have now

19:54.160 --> 19:58.040
 are interesting but limited in certain ways.

19:58.040 --> 20:01.680
 In particular, they rely on us having a brain and so on,

20:01.680 --> 20:03.560
 which is outside the virtual world.

20:03.560 --> 20:07.520
 Maybe I'll strap on my VR headset or just hang out

20:07.520 --> 20:12.520
 in a virtual world on a screen, but my brain

20:12.920 --> 20:16.560
 and then my physical environment might be simulated

20:16.560 --> 20:18.560
 if I'm in a virtual world, but right now,

20:18.560 --> 20:21.320
 there's no attempt to simulate my brain.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.120
 There might be some non player characters

20:24.120 --> 20:27.440
 in these virtual worlds that have simulated

20:27.440 --> 20:29.040
 cognitive systems of certain kinds

20:29.040 --> 20:31.280
 that dictate their behavior, but mostly,

20:31.280 --> 20:33.080
 they're pretty simple right now.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.640
 I mean, some people are trying to combine,

20:34.640 --> 20:36.900
 put a bit of AI in their non player characters

20:36.900 --> 20:41.340
 to make them smarter, but for now,

20:41.340 --> 20:43.720
 inside virtual world, the actual thinking

20:43.720 --> 20:46.000
 is interestingly distinct from the physics

20:46.000 --> 20:47.180
 of those virtual worlds.

20:47.180 --> 20:48.920
 In a way, actually, I like to think this is kind of

20:48.920 --> 20:50.480
 reminiscent of the way that Descartes

20:50.480 --> 20:52.280
 thought our physical world was.

20:52.280 --> 20:54.400
 There's physics, and there's the mind,

20:54.400 --> 20:55.240
 and they're separate.

20:55.240 --> 20:58.800
 Now we think the mind is somehow connected

20:58.800 --> 21:01.100
 to physics pretty deeply, but in these virtual worlds,

21:01.100 --> 21:03.000
 there's a physics of a virtual world,

21:03.000 --> 21:04.840
 and then there's this brain which is totally

21:04.840 --> 21:06.880
 outside the virtual world that controls it

21:06.880 --> 21:10.520
 and interacts it when anyone exercises agency

21:10.520 --> 21:12.360
 in a video game, that's actually somebody

21:12.360 --> 21:14.920
 outside the virtual world moving a controller,

21:14.920 --> 21:16.680
 controlling the interaction of things

21:16.680 --> 21:18.240
 inside the virtual world.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.460
 So right now, in virtual worlds,

21:20.460 --> 21:22.360
 the mind is somehow outside the world,

21:22.360 --> 21:25.040
 but you could imagine in the future,

21:25.040 --> 21:29.080
 once we have developed serious AI,

21:29.080 --> 21:31.560
 artificial general intelligence, and so on,

21:31.560 --> 21:34.440
 then we could come to virtual worlds

21:34.440 --> 21:35.720
 which have enough sophistication,

21:35.720 --> 21:38.040
 you could actually simulate a brain

21:38.040 --> 21:42.920
 or have a genuine AGI, which would then presumably

21:42.920 --> 21:45.880
 be able to act in equally sophisticated ways,

21:45.880 --> 21:47.880
 maybe even more sophisticated ways,

21:47.880 --> 21:50.520
 inside the virtual world to how it might

21:50.520 --> 21:52.400
 in the physical world, and then the question's

21:52.400 --> 21:56.040
 gonna come along, that would be kind of a VR,

21:56.040 --> 21:59.520
 virtual world internal intelligence,

21:59.520 --> 22:01.720
 and then the question is could they have consciousness,

22:01.720 --> 22:04.720
 experience, intelligence, free will,

22:04.720 --> 22:06.520
 all the things that we have, and again,

22:06.520 --> 22:08.840
 my view is I don't see why not.

22:08.840 --> 22:13.160
 To linger on it a little bit, I find virtual reality really

22:13.160 --> 22:15.880
 incredibly powerful, just even the crude virtual reality

22:15.880 --> 22:20.880
 we have now of perhaps there's psychological effects

22:21.800 --> 22:23.960
 that make some people more amenable

22:23.960 --> 22:26.260
 to virtual worlds than others, but I find myself

22:26.260 --> 22:28.360
 wanting to stay in virtual worlds for the most part.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.200
 You do?

22:29.200 --> 22:30.020
 Yes.

22:30.020 --> 22:32.080
 With a headset or on a desktop?

22:32.080 --> 22:33.020
 No, with a headset.

22:33.020 --> 22:35.640
 Really interesting, because I am totally addicted

22:35.640 --> 22:40.640
 to using the internet and things on a desktop,

22:40.680 --> 22:43.040
 but when it comes to VR, with a headset,

22:43.040 --> 22:46.140
 I don't typically use it for more than 10 or 20 minutes.

22:46.140 --> 22:48.760
 There's something just slightly aversive about it, I find,

22:48.760 --> 22:52.120
 so I don't, right now, even though I have Oculus Rift

22:52.120 --> 22:55.800
 and Oculus Quest and HTC Vive and Samsung, this and that.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.360
 You just don't wanna stay in that world for long.

22:57.360 --> 22:58.760
 Not for extended periods.

22:58.760 --> 23:01.000
 You actually find yourself hanging out in that.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.660
 Something about, it's both a combination

23:03.660 --> 23:08.000
 of just imagination and considering the possibilities

23:08.000 --> 23:10.640
 of where this goes in the future.

23:10.640 --> 23:15.640
 It feels like I want to almost prepare my brain for it.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.680
 I wanna explore sort of Disneyland

23:19.680 --> 23:23.700
 when it's first being built in the early days,

23:23.700 --> 23:27.400
 and it feels like I'm walking around

23:27.400 --> 23:31.420
 almost imagining the possibilities,

23:31.420 --> 23:33.840
 and something through that process allows my mind

23:33.840 --> 23:36.020
 to really enter into that world,

23:36.020 --> 23:41.020
 but you say that the brain is external to that virtual world.

23:41.940 --> 23:46.600
 It is, strictly speaking, true, but...

23:46.600 --> 23:50.600
 If you're in VR and you do brain surgery on an avatar,

23:50.600 --> 23:51.800
 and you're gonna open up that skull,

23:51.800 --> 23:53.000
 what are you gonna find?

23:53.000 --> 23:53.840
 Sorry, nothing there.

23:53.840 --> 23:54.680
 Nothing.

23:54.680 --> 23:55.880
 The brain is elsewhere.

23:55.880 --> 23:59.520
 You don't think it's possible to kind of separate them,

23:59.520 --> 24:02.040
 and I don't mean in a sense like Descartes,

24:02.960 --> 24:06.720
 like a hard separation, but basically,

24:06.720 --> 24:09.600
 do you think it's possible with the brain outside

24:09.600 --> 24:13.240
 of the virtual rhythm, when you're wearing a headset,

24:14.920 --> 24:19.840
 create a new consciousness for prolonged periods of time?

24:19.840 --> 24:24.660
 Really feel, like really, like forget

24:24.660 --> 24:26.280
 that your brain is outside.

24:26.280 --> 24:27.800
 So this is, okay, this is gonna be the case

24:27.800 --> 24:29.200
 where the brain is still outside.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.040
 It's still outside.

24:30.040 --> 24:32.120
 But could living in the VR, I mean,

24:32.120 --> 24:35.120
 we already find this, right, with video games.

24:35.120 --> 24:35.960
 Exactly.

24:35.960 --> 24:39.200
 They're completely immersive, and you get taken up

24:39.200 --> 24:40.640
 by living in those worlds,

24:40.640 --> 24:43.200
 and it becomes your reality for a while.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.760
 So they're not completely immersive,

24:44.760 --> 24:46.040
 they're just very immersive.

24:46.040 --> 24:46.880
 Completely immersive.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.800
 You don't forget the external world, no.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.920
 Exactly, so that's what I'm asking.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.220
 Do you think it's almost possible

24:52.220 --> 24:55.700
 to really forget the external world?

24:55.700 --> 24:58.440
 Really, really immerse yourself.

24:58.440 --> 24:59.840
 To forget completely?

24:59.840 --> 25:00.680
 Why would we forget?

25:00.680 --> 25:02.200
 We got pretty good memories.

25:02.200 --> 25:06.000
 Maybe you can stop paying attention to the external world,

25:06.000 --> 25:07.540
 but this already happens a lot.

25:07.540 --> 25:10.000
 I go to work, and maybe I'm not paying attention

25:10.000 --> 25:11.080
 to my home life.

25:11.080 --> 25:14.520
 I go to a movie, and I'm immersed in that.

25:14.520 --> 25:17.100
 So that degree of immersion, absolutely.

25:17.100 --> 25:19.640
 But we still have the capacity to remember it,

25:19.640 --> 25:21.960
 to completely forget the external world.

25:21.960 --> 25:23.920
 I'm thinking that would probably take some,

25:23.920 --> 25:25.760
 I don't know, some pretty serious drugs or something

25:25.760 --> 25:27.600
 to make your brain do that.

25:27.600 --> 25:28.960
 Is that possible?

25:28.960 --> 25:31.040
 So, I mean, I guess what I'm getting at

25:31.040 --> 25:35.640
 is consciousness truly a property

25:35.640 --> 25:38.520
 that's tied to the physical brain?

25:41.040 --> 25:45.000
 Or can you create sort of different offspring,

25:45.000 --> 25:47.600
 copies of consciousnesses based on the worlds

25:47.600 --> 25:48.540
 that you enter?

25:49.400 --> 25:51.560
 Well, the way we're doing it now,

25:51.560 --> 25:54.900
 at least with a standard VR, there's just one brain.

25:54.900 --> 25:56.640
 Interacts with the physical world.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.360
 Plays a video game, puts on a video headset,

25:59.360 --> 26:01.720
 interacts with this virtual world.

26:01.720 --> 26:04.800
 And I think we'd typically say there's one consciousness here

26:04.800 --> 26:07.520
 that nonetheless undergoes different environments,

26:07.520 --> 26:11.880
 takes on different characters in different environments.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.160
 This is already something that happens

26:13.160 --> 26:14.320
 in the nonvirtual world.

26:14.320 --> 26:17.480
 I might interact one way in my home life,

26:17.480 --> 26:21.200
 my work life, my social life, and so on.

26:21.200 --> 26:23.960
 So at the very least, that will happen

26:23.960 --> 26:25.780
 in a virtual world very naturally.

26:25.780 --> 26:30.360
 People sometimes adopt the character of avatars

26:30.360 --> 26:32.400
 very different from themselves,

26:32.400 --> 26:34.800
 maybe even a different gender, different race,

26:34.800 --> 26:37.000
 different social background.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.800
 So that much is certainly possible.

26:38.800 --> 26:41.160
 I would see that as a single consciousness

26:41.160 --> 26:43.360
 is taking on different personas.

26:43.360 --> 26:46.280
 If you want literal splitting of consciousness

26:46.280 --> 26:47.400
 into multiple copies,

26:47.400 --> 26:50.640
 I think it's gonna take something more radical than that.

26:50.640 --> 26:54.360
 Like maybe you can run different simulations of your brain

26:54.360 --> 26:56.080
 in different realities

26:56.080 --> 26:57.880
 and then expose them to different histories.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.160
 And then you'd split yourself

27:00.160 --> 27:01.900
 into 10 different simulated copies,

27:01.900 --> 27:04.120
 which then undergo different environments

27:04.120 --> 27:05.680
 and then ultimately do become 10

27:05.680 --> 27:07.720
 very different consciousnesses.

27:07.720 --> 27:08.600
 Maybe that could happen,

27:08.600 --> 27:10.440
 but now we're not talking about something

27:10.440 --> 27:12.240
 that's possible in the near term.

27:12.240 --> 27:14.040
 We're gonna have to have brain simulations

27:14.040 --> 27:16.260
 and AGI for that to happen.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.240
 Got it.

27:18.240 --> 27:20.200
 So before any of that happens,

27:20.200 --> 27:23.760
 it's fundamentally you see it as a singular consciousness,

27:23.760 --> 27:26.400
 even though it's experiencing different environments,

27:26.400 --> 27:27.780
 virtual or not,

27:27.780 --> 27:30.480
 it's still connected to same set of memories,

27:30.480 --> 27:32.760
 same set of experiences and therefore,

27:32.760 --> 27:37.760
 one sort of joint conscious system.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.560
 Yeah, or at least no more multiple

27:40.560 --> 27:42.140
 than the kind of multiple consciousness

27:42.140 --> 27:45.000
 that we get from inhabiting different environments

27:45.000 --> 27:46.720
 in a non virtual world.

27:46.720 --> 27:48.760
 So you said as a child,

27:48.760 --> 27:53.440
 you were a music color synesthete.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.380
 So where songs had colors for you.

27:56.440 --> 27:59.760
 So what songs had what colors?

27:59.760 --> 28:00.960
 You know, this is funny.

28:00.960 --> 28:04.040
 I didn't pay much attention to this at the time,

28:04.040 --> 28:05.340
 but I'd listen to a piece of music

28:05.340 --> 28:07.560
 and I'd get some kind of imagery

28:07.560 --> 28:11.400
 of a kind of color.

28:11.400 --> 28:16.120
 The weird thing is mostly they were kind of murky,

28:16.120 --> 28:18.560
 dark greens and olive browns

28:18.560 --> 28:21.600
 and the colors weren't all that interesting.

28:21.600 --> 28:22.520
 I don't know what the reason is.

28:22.520 --> 28:25.280
 I mean, my theory is that maybe it's like different chords

28:25.280 --> 28:27.720
 and tones provided different colors

28:27.720 --> 28:29.280
 and they all tended to get mixed together

28:29.280 --> 28:33.200
 into these somewhat uninteresting browns and greens.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.480
 But every now and then there'd be something

28:35.480 --> 28:37.360
 that had a really pure color.

28:37.360 --> 28:39.360
 So there's just a few that I remember.

28:39.360 --> 28:42.440
 There was a Here, There and Everywhere by the Beatles

28:42.440 --> 28:46.360
 was bright red and has this very distinctive tonality

28:46.360 --> 28:49.680
 and it's called structure at the beginning.

28:49.680 --> 28:50.880
 So that was bright red.

28:50.880 --> 28:53.960
 There was this song by the Alan Parsons Project

28:53.960 --> 28:58.960
 called Ammonia Avenue that was kind of a pure, a pure blue.

28:59.720 --> 29:02.080
 Anyway, I've got no idea how this happened.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.120
 I didn't even pay that much attention

29:03.120 --> 29:05.400
 until it went away when I was about 20.

29:05.400 --> 29:07.480
 This synesthesia often goes away.

29:07.480 --> 29:10.960
 So is it purely just the perception of a particular color

29:10.960 --> 29:14.320
 or was there a positive or negative experience?

29:14.320 --> 29:16.400
 Like was blue associated with a positive

29:16.400 --> 29:17.920
 and red with a negative?

29:17.920 --> 29:20.960
 Or is it simply the perception of color

29:20.960 --> 29:23.440
 associated with some characteristic of the song?

29:23.440 --> 29:25.760
 For me, I don't remember a lot of association

29:25.760 --> 29:28.320
 with emotion or with value.

29:28.320 --> 29:30.920
 It was just this kind of weird and interesting fact.

29:30.920 --> 29:32.360
 I mean, at the beginning, I thought this was something

29:32.360 --> 29:35.000
 that happened to everyone, songs of colors.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.040
 Maybe I mentioned it once or twice and people said, nope.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.560
 I thought it was kind of cool when there was one

29:42.560 --> 29:44.680
 that had one of these especially pure colors,

29:44.680 --> 29:48.200
 but only much later once I became a grad student

29:48.200 --> 29:50.600
 thinking about the mind that I read about this phenomenon

29:50.600 --> 29:53.960
 called synesthesia and I was like, hey, that's what I had.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.560
 And now I occasionally talk about it in my classes,

29:56.560 --> 29:58.600
 in intro class and it still happens sometimes.

29:58.600 --> 30:01.120
 A student comes up and says, hey, I have that.

30:01.120 --> 30:01.960
 I never knew about that.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.280
 I never knew it had a name.

30:04.520 --> 30:08.080
 You said that it went away at age 20 or so.

30:08.080 --> 30:13.080
 And that you have a journal entry from around then saying,

30:13.080 --> 30:15.240
 songs don't have colors anymore.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.080
 What happened?

30:16.080 --> 30:16.920
 What happened?

30:16.920 --> 30:18.800
 Yeah, it was definitely sad that it was gone.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.680
 In retrospect, it was like, hey, that's cool.

30:20.680 --> 30:21.920
 The colors have gone.

30:21.920 --> 30:25.000
 Yeah, can you think about that for a little bit?

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
 Do you miss those experiences?

30:27.000 --> 30:31.720
 Because it's a fundamentally different set of experiences

30:31.720 --> 30:33.320
 that you no longer have.

30:35.120 --> 30:38.360
 Or is it just a nice thing to have had?

30:38.360 --> 30:40.640
 You don't see them as that fundamentally different

30:40.640 --> 30:43.680
 than you visiting a new country and experiencing

30:43.680 --> 30:44.960
 new environments.

30:44.960 --> 30:47.440
 I guess for me, when I had these experiences,

30:47.440 --> 30:48.960
 they were somewhat marginal.

30:48.960 --> 30:51.640
 They were like a little bonus kind of experience.

30:51.640 --> 30:55.120
 I know there are people who have much more serious forms

30:55.120 --> 30:58.800
 of synesthesia than this for whom it's absolutely central

30:58.800 --> 30:59.640
 to their lives.

30:59.640 --> 31:01.800
 I know people who, when they experience new people,

31:01.800 --> 31:04.760
 they have colors, maybe they have tastes and so on.

31:04.760 --> 31:08.320
 Every time they see writing, it has colors.

31:08.320 --> 31:09.640
 Some people, whenever they hear music,

31:09.640 --> 31:14.640
 it's got a certain really rich color pattern.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.440
 For some synesthetes, it's absolutely central.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.200
 I think if they lost it, they'd be devastated.

31:20.200 --> 31:23.760
 Again, for me, it was a very, very mild form

31:23.760 --> 31:25.560
 of synesthesia, and it's like, yeah,

31:25.560 --> 31:27.360
 it's like those interesting experiences

31:29.440 --> 31:31.560
 you might get under different altered states

31:31.560 --> 31:33.360
 of consciousness and so on.

31:33.360 --> 31:36.200
 It's kind of cool, but not necessarily

31:36.200 --> 31:39.280
 the single most important experiences in your life.

31:39.280 --> 31:40.120
 Got it.

31:40.120 --> 31:43.920
 So let's try to go to the very simplest question

31:43.920 --> 31:45.120
 that you've answered many a time,

31:45.120 --> 31:48.560
 but perhaps the simplest things can help us reveal,

31:48.560 --> 31:51.680
 even in time, some new ideas.

31:51.680 --> 31:55.640
 So what, in your view, is consciousness?

31:55.640 --> 31:56.840
 What is qualia?

31:56.840 --> 32:00.680
 What is the hard problem of consciousness?

32:00.680 --> 32:03.360
 Consciousness, I mean, the word is used many ways,

32:03.360 --> 32:06.240
 but the kind of consciousness that I'm interested in

32:06.240 --> 32:10.000
 is basically subjective experience,

32:10.000 --> 32:14.360
 what it feels like from the inside to be a human being

32:14.360 --> 32:16.160
 or any other conscious being.

32:16.160 --> 32:19.720
 I mean, there's something it's like to be me right now.

32:19.720 --> 32:23.520
 I have visual images that I'm experiencing.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.600
 I'm hearing my voice.

32:25.600 --> 32:29.120
 I've got maybe some emotional tone.

32:29.120 --> 32:31.640
 I've got a stream of thoughts running through my head.

32:31.640 --> 32:33.600
 These are all things that I experience

32:33.600 --> 32:36.240
 from the first person point of view.

32:36.240 --> 32:39.120
 I've sometimes called this the inner movie in the mind.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.600
 It's not a perfect metaphor.

32:41.600 --> 32:44.200
 It's not like a movie in every way,

32:44.200 --> 32:45.640
 and it's very rich.

32:45.640 --> 32:49.360
 But yeah, it's just direct, subjective experience.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.360
 And I call that consciousness,

32:51.360 --> 32:54.600
 or sometimes philosophers use the word qualia,

32:54.600 --> 32:55.480
 which you suggested.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.040
 People tend to use the word qualia

32:57.040 --> 33:00.400
 for things like the qualities of things like colors,

33:00.400 --> 33:02.280
 redness, the experience of redness

33:02.280 --> 33:04.640
 versus the experience of greenness,

33:04.640 --> 33:08.800
 the experience of one taste or one smell versus another,

33:08.800 --> 33:10.920
 the experience of the quality of pain.

33:10.920 --> 33:12.680
 And yeah, a lot of consciousness

33:12.680 --> 33:17.000
 is the experience of those qualities.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.240
 Well, consciousness is bigger,

33:18.240 --> 33:21.040
 the entirety of any kinds of experiences.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.880
 Consciousness of thinking is not obviously qualia.

33:23.880 --> 33:26.440
 It's not like specific qualities like redness or greenness,

33:26.440 --> 33:29.200
 but still I'm thinking about my hometown.

33:29.200 --> 33:31.680
 I'm thinking about what I'm gonna do later on.

33:31.680 --> 33:34.160
 Maybe there's still something running through my head,

33:34.160 --> 33:36.320
 which is subjective experience.

33:36.320 --> 33:39.960
 Maybe it goes beyond those qualities or qualia.

33:39.960 --> 33:43.000
 Philosophers sometimes use the word phenomenal consciousness

33:43.000 --> 33:44.680
 for consciousness in this sense.

33:44.680 --> 33:47.480
 I mean, people also talk about access consciousness,

33:47.480 --> 33:50.280
 being able to access information in your mind,

33:50.280 --> 33:52.080
 reflective consciousness,

33:52.080 --> 33:53.920
 being able to think about yourself.

33:53.920 --> 33:55.920
 But it looks like the really mysterious one,

33:55.920 --> 33:57.240
 the one that really gets people going

33:57.240 --> 33:58.880
 is phenomenal consciousness.

33:58.880 --> 34:02.760
 The fact that there's subjective experience

34:02.760 --> 34:05.120
 and all this feels like something at all.

34:05.120 --> 34:08.880
 And then the hard problem is how is it that,

34:08.880 --> 34:11.520
 why is it that there is phenomenal consciousness at all?

34:11.520 --> 34:15.600
 And how is it that physical processes in a brain

34:15.600 --> 34:19.400
 could give you subjective experience?

34:19.400 --> 34:21.680
 It looks like on the face of it,

34:21.680 --> 34:23.920
 you'd have all this big complicated physical system

34:23.920 --> 34:27.240
 in a brain running without a given

34:27.240 --> 34:28.480
 subjective experience at all.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.840
 And yet we do have subjective experience.

34:30.840 --> 34:33.200
 So the hard problem is just explain that.

34:34.160 --> 34:35.960
 Explain how that comes about.

34:35.960 --> 34:37.560
 We haven't been able to build machines

34:37.560 --> 34:41.320
 where a red light goes on that says it's not conscious.

34:41.320 --> 34:45.720
 So how do we actually create that?

34:45.720 --> 34:47.360
 Or how do humans do it?

34:47.360 --> 34:49.000
 And how do we ourselves do it?

34:49.000 --> 34:51.720
 We do every now and then create machines that can do this.

34:51.720 --> 34:55.600
 We create babies that are conscious.

34:55.600 --> 34:56.560
 They've got these brains.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.440
 That brain does produce consciousness.

34:58.440 --> 35:00.680
 But even though we can create it,

35:00.680 --> 35:02.880
 we still don't understand why it happens.

35:02.880 --> 35:05.440
 Maybe eventually we'll be able to create machines,

35:05.440 --> 35:07.840
 which as a matter of fact, AI machines,

35:07.840 --> 35:10.280
 which as a matter of fact are conscious.

35:10.280 --> 35:13.760
 But that won't necessarily make the hard problem go away

35:13.760 --> 35:15.480
 any more than it does with babies.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.480
 Cause we still wanna know how and why is it

35:17.480 --> 35:19.680
 that these processes give you consciousness?

35:19.680 --> 35:22.160
 You just made me realize for a second,

35:22.160 --> 35:27.160
 maybe it's a totally dumb realization, but nevertheless,

35:28.520 --> 35:31.840
 that as a useful way to think about

35:31.840 --> 35:35.760
 the creation of consciousness is looking at a baby.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.520
 So that there's a certain point

35:38.480 --> 35:40.880
 at which that baby is not conscious.

35:44.400 --> 35:47.160
 The baby starts from maybe, I don't know,

35:47.160 --> 35:49.600
 from a few cells, right?

35:49.600 --> 35:52.760
 There's a certain point at which it becomes consciousness,

35:52.760 --> 35:54.920
 arrives, it's conscious.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.880
 Of course, we can't know exactly that line,

35:56.880 --> 36:01.000
 but that's a useful idea that we do create consciousness.

36:02.280 --> 36:04.560
 Again, a really dumb thing for me to say,

36:04.560 --> 36:07.000
 but not until now did I realize

36:07.000 --> 36:09.640
 we do engineer consciousness.

36:09.640 --> 36:12.240
 We get to watch the process happen.

36:12.240 --> 36:16.200
 We don't know which point it happens or where it is,

36:16.200 --> 36:19.200
 but we do see the birth of consciousness.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.080
 Yeah, I mean, there's a question, of course,

36:21.080 --> 36:25.000
 is whether babies are conscious when they're born.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.320
 And it used to be, it seems,

36:26.320 --> 36:28.240
 at least some people thought they weren't,

36:28.240 --> 36:30.520
 which is why they didn't give anesthetics

36:30.520 --> 36:33.160
 to newborn babies when they circumcised them.

36:33.160 --> 36:36.600
 And so now people think, oh, that would be incredibly cruel.

36:36.600 --> 36:38.760
 Of course, babies feel pain.

36:38.760 --> 36:42.120
 And now the dominant view is that the babies can feel pain.

36:42.120 --> 36:45.840
 Actually, my partner Claudia works on this whole issue

36:45.840 --> 36:48.160
 of whether there's consciousness in babies

36:48.160 --> 36:49.720
 and of what kind.

36:49.720 --> 36:52.200
 And she certainly thinks that newborn babies

36:53.280 --> 36:55.480
 come into the world with some degree of consciousness.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.320
 Of course, then you can just extend the question backwards

36:57.320 --> 36:59.320
 to fetuses and suddenly you're into

36:59.320 --> 37:02.120
 politically controversial territory.

37:02.120 --> 37:06.840
 But the question also arises in the animal kingdom.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.640
 Where does consciousness start or stop?

37:08.640 --> 37:11.080
 Is there a line in the animal kingdom

37:11.960 --> 37:14.720
 where the first conscious organisms are?

37:15.920 --> 37:16.920
 It's interesting, over time,

37:16.920 --> 37:18.240
 people are becoming more and more liberal

37:18.240 --> 37:21.080
 about ascribing consciousness to animals.

37:21.080 --> 37:24.520
 People used to think maybe only mammals could be conscious.

37:24.520 --> 37:27.440
 Now most people seem to think, sure, fish are conscious.

37:27.440 --> 37:28.760
 They can feel pain.

37:28.760 --> 37:31.000
 And now we're arguing over insects.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.440
 You'll find people out there who say plants

37:33.440 --> 37:35.600
 have some degree of consciousness.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.840
 So, you know, who knows where it's gonna end.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.360
 The far end of this chain is the view

37:39.360 --> 37:43.320
 that every physical system has some degree of consciousness.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.960
 Philosophers call that panpsychism.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.320
 You know, I take that view.

37:48.320 --> 37:50.920
 I mean, that's a fascinating way to view reality.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.840
 So if you could talk about,

37:52.840 --> 37:56.520
 if you can linger on panpsychism for a little bit,

37:56.520 --> 37:58.400
 what does it mean?

37:58.400 --> 38:00.960
 So it's not just plants are conscious.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.480
 I mean, it's that consciousness

38:02.480 --> 38:05.360
 is a fundamental fabric of reality.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.360
 What does that mean to you?

38:07.360 --> 38:09.640
 How are we supposed to think about that?

38:09.640 --> 38:12.120
 Well, we're used to the idea that some things in the world

38:12.120 --> 38:15.240
 are fundamental, right, in physics.

38:15.240 --> 38:16.080
 Like what?

38:16.080 --> 38:18.800
 We take things like space or time or space time,

38:18.800 --> 38:23.120
 mass, charges, fundamental properties of the universe.

38:23.120 --> 38:25.440
 You don't reduce them to something simpler.

38:25.440 --> 38:26.920
 You take those for granted.

38:26.920 --> 38:30.120
 You've got some laws that connect them.

38:30.120 --> 38:33.800
 Here is how mass and space and time evolve.

38:33.800 --> 38:36.600
 Theories like relativity or quantum mechanics

38:36.600 --> 38:39.960
 or some future theory that will unify them both.

38:39.960 --> 38:42.520
 But everyone says you gotta take some things as fundamental.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.600
 And if you can't explain one thing,

38:44.600 --> 38:47.120
 in terms of the previous fundamental things,

38:47.120 --> 38:48.240
 you have to expand.

38:49.240 --> 38:51.640
 Maybe something like this happened with Maxwell.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.160
 He ended up with fundamental principles

38:54.160 --> 38:57.480
 of electromagnetism and took charge as fundamental

38:57.480 --> 39:00.120
 because it turned out that was the best way to explain it.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.840
 So I at least take seriously the possibility

39:02.840 --> 39:06.080
 something like that could happen with consciousness.

39:06.080 --> 39:07.600
 Take it as a fundamental property,

39:07.600 --> 39:10.120
 like space, time, and mass.

39:10.120 --> 39:13.760
 And instead of trying to explain consciousness wholly

39:13.760 --> 39:17.480
 in terms of the evolution of space, time, and mass,

39:17.480 --> 39:20.000
 and so on, take it as a primitive

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
 and then connect it to everything else

39:23.000 --> 39:25.200
 by some fundamental laws.

39:25.200 --> 39:27.120
 Because there's this basic problem

39:27.120 --> 39:29.080
 that the physics we have now looks great

39:29.080 --> 39:31.800
 for solving the easy problems of consciousness,

39:31.800 --> 39:33.240
 which are all about behavior.

39:35.280 --> 39:37.440
 They give us a complicated structure and dynamics.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.640
 They tell us how things are gonna behave,

39:39.640 --> 39:43.160
 what kind of observable behavior they'll produce,

39:43.160 --> 39:46.400
 which is great for the problems of explaining how we walk

39:46.400 --> 39:48.600
 and how we talk and so on.

39:48.600 --> 39:50.640
 Those are the easy problems of consciousness.

39:50.640 --> 39:52.560
 But the hard problem was this problem

39:52.560 --> 39:55.360
 about subjective experience just doesn't look

39:55.360 --> 39:57.000
 like that kind of problem about structure,

39:57.000 --> 39:58.800
 dynamics, how things behave.

39:58.800 --> 40:01.320
 So it's hard to see how existing physics

40:01.320 --> 40:04.680
 is gonna give you a full explanation of that.

40:04.680 --> 40:08.000
 Certainly trying to get a physics view of consciousness,

40:08.000 --> 40:10.960
 yes, there has to be a connecting point

40:10.960 --> 40:12.600
 and it could be at the very axiomatic

40:12.600 --> 40:14.120
 at the very beginning level.

40:14.120 --> 40:19.120
 But first of all, there's a crazy idea

40:21.960 --> 40:25.760
 that sort of everything has properties of consciousness.

40:27.640 --> 40:30.080
 At that point, the word consciousness

40:30.080 --> 40:33.000
 is already beyond the reach of our current understanding.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.800
 Like far, because it's so far from,

40:35.800 --> 40:38.760
 at least for me, maybe you can correct me,

40:38.760 --> 40:43.760
 as far from the experiences that I have as a human being.

40:45.680 --> 40:47.360
 To say that everything is conscious,

40:47.360 --> 40:52.360
 that means that basically another way to put that,

40:52.840 --> 40:56.840
 if that's true, then we understand almost nothing

40:56.840 --> 41:00.120
 about that fundamental aspect of the world.

41:00.120 --> 41:02.760
 How do you feel about saying an ant is conscious?

41:02.760 --> 41:04.040
 Do you get the same reaction to that

41:04.040 --> 41:05.760
 or is that something you can understand?

41:05.760 --> 41:06.880
 I can understand ant,

41:06.880 --> 41:10.680
 I can understand an atom, a particle.

41:10.680 --> 41:12.120
 Plants?

41:12.120 --> 41:16.640
 Plant, so I'm comfortable with living things on Earth

41:16.640 --> 41:20.840
 being conscious because there's some kind of agency

41:22.040 --> 41:25.200
 where they're similar size to me

41:26.480 --> 41:30.800
 and they can be born and they can die.

41:30.800 --> 41:34.400
 And that is understandable intuitively.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.720
 Of course, you anthropomorphize,

41:36.720 --> 41:39.040
 you put yourself in the place of the plant,

41:41.720 --> 41:43.240
 but I can understand it.

41:43.240 --> 41:47.600
 I mean, I'm not like, I don't believe actually

41:47.600 --> 41:49.600
 that plants are conscious or that plants suffer,

41:49.600 --> 41:52.960
 but I can understand that kind of belief, that kind of idea.

41:52.960 --> 41:54.920
 How do you feel about robots?

41:54.920 --> 41:56.760
 Like the kind of robots we have now?

41:56.760 --> 41:58.880
 If I told you like that a Roomba

41:58.880 --> 42:00.400
 had some degree of consciousness

42:02.280 --> 42:06.120
 or some deep neural network.

42:06.120 --> 42:08.440
 I could understand that a Roomba has consciousness.

42:08.440 --> 42:10.640
 I just had spent all day at I, robot.

42:12.600 --> 42:15.200
 And I mean, I personally love robots

42:15.200 --> 42:16.960
 and I have a deep connection with robots.

42:16.960 --> 42:20.040
 So I can, I also probably anthropomorphize them.

42:20.040 --> 42:23.880
 There's something about the physical object.

42:23.880 --> 42:26.800
 So there's a difference than a neural network,

42:26.800 --> 42:28.960
 a neural network running a software.

42:28.960 --> 42:31.040
 To me, the physical object,

42:31.040 --> 42:32.680
 something about the human experience

42:32.680 --> 42:36.920
 allows me to really see that physical object as an entity.

42:36.920 --> 42:40.920
 And if it moves and moves in a way that it,

42:40.920 --> 42:43.440
 there's a, like I didn't program it,

42:44.400 --> 42:49.400
 where it feels that it's acting based on its own perception.

42:49.680 --> 42:53.440
 And yes, self awareness and consciousness,

42:53.440 --> 42:55.440
 even if it's a Roomba,

42:55.440 --> 43:00.440
 then you start to assign it some agency, some consciousness.

43:00.440 --> 43:03.800
 So, but to say that panpsychism,

43:03.800 --> 43:06.920
 that consciousness is a fundamental property of reality

43:08.440 --> 43:11.360
 is a much bigger statement.

43:11.360 --> 43:13.600
 That it's like turtles all the way.

43:13.600 --> 43:16.080
 It's like every, it's, it doesn't end.

43:16.080 --> 43:18.360
 The whole thing is, so like how,

43:18.360 --> 43:20.140
 I know it's full of mystery,

43:21.120 --> 43:23.880
 but if you can linger on it,

43:23.880 --> 43:27.600
 like how would it, how do you think about reality

43:27.600 --> 43:31.840
 if consciousness is a fundamental part of its fabric?

43:31.840 --> 43:33.300
 The way you get there is from thinking,

43:33.300 --> 43:36.520
 can we explain consciousness given the existing fundamentals?

43:36.520 --> 43:41.120
 And then if you can't, as at least right now, it looks like,

43:41.120 --> 43:42.320
 then you've got to add something.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.920
 It doesn't follow that you have to add consciousness.

43:44.920 --> 43:47.000
 Here's another interesting possibility is,

43:47.000 --> 43:48.020
 well, we'll add something else.

43:48.020 --> 43:51.640
 Let's call it proto consciousness or X.

43:51.640 --> 43:56.120
 And then it turns out space, time, mass plus X

43:56.120 --> 43:58.920
 will somehow collectively give you the possibility

43:58.920 --> 44:00.200
 for consciousness.

44:00.200 --> 44:01.780
 Why don't rule out that view?

44:01.780 --> 44:04.760
 Either I call that pan proto psychism,

44:04.760 --> 44:06.240
 because maybe there's some other property,

44:06.240 --> 44:08.880
 proto consciousness at the bottom level.

44:08.880 --> 44:10.480
 And if you can't imagine there's actually

44:10.480 --> 44:12.800
 genuine consciousness at the bottom level,

44:12.800 --> 44:14.100
 I think we should be open to the idea

44:14.100 --> 44:16.160
 there's this other thing X.

44:16.160 --> 44:19.960
 Maybe we can't imagine that somehow gives you consciousness.

44:19.960 --> 44:22.360
 But if we are playing along with the idea

44:22.360 --> 44:24.320
 that there really is genuine consciousness

44:24.320 --> 44:25.360
 at the bottom level, of course,

44:25.360 --> 44:28.280
 this is going to be way out and speculative,

44:28.280 --> 44:32.040
 but at least in, say, if it was classical physics,

44:32.040 --> 44:33.480
 then we'd have to, you'd end up saying,

44:33.480 --> 44:35.280
 well, every little atom, every little,

44:35.280 --> 44:37.640
 with a bunch of particles in space time,

44:37.640 --> 44:41.560
 each of these particles has some kind of consciousness

44:41.560 --> 44:44.560
 whose structure mirrors maybe their physical properties,

44:44.560 --> 44:49.080
 like its mass, its charge, its velocity, and so on.

44:49.080 --> 44:50.320
 The structure of its consciousness

44:50.320 --> 44:52.280
 would roughly correspond to that.

44:52.280 --> 44:55.440
 And the physical interactions between particles,

44:55.440 --> 44:58.280
 I mean, there's this old worry about physics.

44:58.280 --> 44:59.560
 I mentioned this before in this issue

44:59.560 --> 45:01.120
 about the manifest image.

45:01.120 --> 45:02.080
 We don't really find out

45:02.080 --> 45:04.560
 about the intrinsic nature of things.

45:04.560 --> 45:07.440
 Physics tells us about how a particle relates

45:07.440 --> 45:09.320
 to other particles and interacts.

45:09.320 --> 45:12.840
 It doesn't tell us about what the particle is in itself.

45:12.840 --> 45:14.600
 That was Kant's thing in itself.

45:14.600 --> 45:15.680
 So here's a view.

45:17.880 --> 45:20.840
 The nature in itself of a particle is something mental.

45:20.840 --> 45:22.840
 A particle is actually a conscious,

45:22.840 --> 45:24.520
 a little conscious subject

45:24.520 --> 45:27.320
 with properties of its consciousness

45:27.320 --> 45:29.160
 that correspond to its physical properties.

45:29.160 --> 45:32.640
 The laws of physics are actually ultimately relating

45:32.640 --> 45:34.560
 these properties of conscious subjects.

45:34.560 --> 45:36.640
 So in this view, a Newtonian world

45:36.640 --> 45:38.200
 actually would be a vast collection

45:38.200 --> 45:41.240
 of little conscious subjects at the bottom level,

45:41.240 --> 45:44.960
 way, way simpler than we are without free will

45:44.960 --> 45:47.280
 or rationality or anything like that.

45:47.280 --> 45:48.800
 But that's what the universe would be like.

45:48.800 --> 45:51.360
 Now, of course, that's a vastly speculative view.

45:51.360 --> 45:53.600
 No particular reason to think it's correct.

45:53.600 --> 45:56.480
 Furthermore, non Newtonian physics,

45:56.480 --> 45:58.960
 say quantum mechanical wave function,

45:58.960 --> 46:00.120
 suddenly it starts to look different.

46:00.120 --> 46:02.600
 It's not a vast collection of conscious subjects.

46:02.600 --> 46:05.360
 Maybe there's ultimately one big wave function

46:05.360 --> 46:06.760
 for the whole universe.

46:06.760 --> 46:08.440
 Corresponding to that might be something more

46:08.440 --> 46:12.280
 like a single conscious mind

46:12.280 --> 46:13.840
 whose structure corresponds

46:13.840 --> 46:16.280
 to the structure of the wave function.

46:16.280 --> 46:19.160
 People sometimes call this cosmo psychism.

46:19.160 --> 46:20.880
 And now, of course, we're in the realm

46:20.880 --> 46:23.200
 of extremely speculative philosophy.

46:23.200 --> 46:25.160
 There's no direct evidence for this,

46:25.160 --> 46:27.320
 but yeah, but if you want a picture

46:27.320 --> 46:29.280
 of what that universe would be like,

46:29.280 --> 46:31.680
 think, yeah, giant cosmic mind

46:31.680 --> 46:33.920
 with enough richness and structure among it

46:33.920 --> 46:36.520
 to replicate all the structure of physics.

46:36.520 --> 46:39.720
 I think therefore I am at the level of particles

46:39.720 --> 46:40.960
 and with quantum mechanics

46:40.960 --> 46:42.640
 at the level of the wave function.

46:42.640 --> 46:47.640
 It's kind of an exciting, beautiful possibility,

46:49.440 --> 46:51.960
 of course, way out of reach of physics currently.

46:51.960 --> 46:55.040
 It is interesting that some neuroscientists

46:55.040 --> 46:58.680
 are beginning to take panpsychism seriously,

46:58.680 --> 47:02.880
 that you find consciousness even in very simple systems.

47:02.880 --> 47:05.560
 So for example, the integrated information theory

47:05.560 --> 47:07.360
 of consciousness, a lot of neuroscientists

47:07.360 --> 47:08.200
 are taking seriously.

47:08.200 --> 47:09.920
 Actually, I just got this new book

47:09.920 --> 47:11.720
 by Christoph Koch just came in,

47:11.720 --> 47:13.680
 The Feeling of Life Itself,

47:13.680 --> 47:17.200
 why consciousness is widespread, but can't be computed.

47:17.200 --> 47:20.560
 He likes, he basically endorses a panpsychist view

47:20.560 --> 47:22.280
 where you get consciousness

47:22.280 --> 47:24.520
 with the degree of information processing

47:24.520 --> 47:26.960
 or integrated information processing in a simple,

47:26.960 --> 47:29.520
 in a system and even very, very simple systems,

47:29.520 --> 47:32.720
 like a couple of particles will have some degree of this.

47:32.720 --> 47:35.240
 So he ends up with some degree of consciousness

47:35.240 --> 47:36.080
 in all matter.

47:36.080 --> 47:38.680
 And the claim is that this theory

47:38.680 --> 47:40.520
 can actually explain a bunch of stuff

47:40.520 --> 47:43.600
 about the connection between the brain and consciousness.

47:43.600 --> 47:45.360
 Now, that's very controversial.

47:45.360 --> 47:46.920
 I think it's very, very early days

47:46.920 --> 47:48.120
 in the science of consciousness.

47:48.120 --> 47:50.840
 It's interesting that it's not just philosophy

47:50.840 --> 47:52.680
 that might lead you in this direction,

47:52.680 --> 47:55.280
 but there are ways of thinking quasi scientifically

47:55.280 --> 47:56.480
 that lead you there too.

47:57.400 --> 48:01.200
 But maybe it's different than panpsychism.

48:01.200 --> 48:02.040
 What do you think?

48:02.040 --> 48:06.960
 So Alan Watts has this quote that I'd like to ask you about.

48:06.960 --> 48:10.440
 The quote is, through our eyes,

48:10.440 --> 48:12.760
 the universe is perceiving itself.

48:12.760 --> 48:14.640
 Through our ears, the universe is listening

48:14.640 --> 48:16.120
 to its harmonies.

48:16.120 --> 48:18.040
 We are the witnesses through which the universe

48:18.040 --> 48:21.400
 becomes conscious of its glory, of its magnificence.

48:22.440 --> 48:24.800
 So that's not panpsychism.

48:24.800 --> 48:29.800
 Do you think that we are essentially the tools,

48:30.480 --> 48:35.480
 the senses the universe created to be conscious of itself?

48:35.480 --> 48:37.520
 It's an interesting idea.

48:37.520 --> 48:40.520
 Of course, if you went for the giant cosmic mind view,

48:40.520 --> 48:43.360
 then the universe was conscious all along.

48:43.360 --> 48:44.200
 It didn't need us.

48:44.200 --> 48:48.120
 We're just little components of the universal consciousness.

48:48.120 --> 48:50.800
 Likewise, if you believe in panpsychism,

48:50.800 --> 48:52.840
 then there was some little degree of consciousness

48:52.840 --> 48:54.680
 at the bottom level all along.

48:54.680 --> 48:58.240
 And we were just a more complex form of consciousness.

48:58.240 --> 49:02.040
 So I think maybe the quote you mentioned works better.

49:02.040 --> 49:05.120
 If you're not a panpsychist, you're not a cosmo psychist,

49:05.120 --> 49:07.240
 you think consciousness just exists

49:07.240 --> 49:09.360
 at this intermediate level.

49:09.360 --> 49:12.320
 And of course, that's the Orthodox view.

49:12.320 --> 49:14.680
 That you would say is the common view?

49:14.680 --> 49:19.680
 So is your own view with panpsychism a rare view?

49:19.880 --> 49:22.160
 I think it's generally regarded certainly

49:22.160 --> 49:26.480
 as a speculative view held by a fairly small minority

49:26.480 --> 49:30.000
 of at least theorists, most philosophers

49:30.000 --> 49:33.040
 and most scientists who think about consciousness

49:33.040 --> 49:34.600
 are not panpsychists.

49:34.600 --> 49:36.240
 There's been a bit of a movement in that direction

49:36.240 --> 49:37.920
 the last 10 years or so.

49:37.920 --> 49:38.960
 It seems to be quite popular,

49:38.960 --> 49:41.600
 especially among the younger generation,

49:41.600 --> 49:43.960
 but it's still very definitely a minority view.

49:43.960 --> 49:47.120
 Many people think it's totally batshit crazy

49:47.120 --> 49:48.320
 to use the technical term.

49:48.320 --> 49:51.360
 But the philosophical term.

49:51.360 --> 49:53.400
 So the Orthodox view, I think is still consciousness

49:53.400 --> 49:55.160
 is something that humans have

49:55.160 --> 49:59.000
 and some good number of nonhuman animals have,

49:59.000 --> 50:02.720
 and maybe AIs might have one day, but it's restricted.

50:02.720 --> 50:04.400
 On that view, then there was no consciousness

50:04.400 --> 50:05.840
 at the start of the universe.

50:05.840 --> 50:07.200
 There may be none at the end,

50:07.200 --> 50:09.920
 but it is this thing which happened at some point

50:09.920 --> 50:13.160
 in the history of the universe, consciousness developed.

50:13.160 --> 50:17.440
 And yes, that's a very amazing event on this view

50:17.440 --> 50:20.280
 because many people are inclined to think consciousness

50:20.280 --> 50:23.160
 is what somehow gives meaning to our lives.

50:23.160 --> 50:25.760
 Without consciousness, there'd be no meaning,

50:25.760 --> 50:29.720
 no true value, no good versus bad and so on.

50:29.720 --> 50:32.200
 So with the advent of consciousness,

50:32.200 --> 50:36.000
 suddenly the universe went from meaningless

50:36.000 --> 50:38.760
 to somehow meaningful.

50:38.760 --> 50:39.840
 Why did this happen?

50:39.840 --> 50:42.200
 I guess the quote you mentioned was somehow,

50:42.200 --> 50:44.360
 this was somehow destined to happen

50:44.360 --> 50:47.360
 because the universe needed to have consciousness

50:47.360 --> 50:49.280
 within it to have value and have meaning.

50:49.280 --> 50:52.680
 And maybe you could combine that with a theistic view

50:52.680 --> 50:54.640
 or a teleological view.

50:54.640 --> 50:58.440
 The universe was inexorably evolving towards consciousness.

50:58.440 --> 51:01.440
 Actually, my colleague here at NYU, Tom Nagel,

51:01.440 --> 51:04.200
 wrote a book called Mind and Cosmos a few years ago

51:04.200 --> 51:06.080
 where he argued for this teleological view

51:06.080 --> 51:09.040
 of evolution toward consciousness,

51:09.040 --> 51:12.640
 saying this led the problems for Darwinism.

51:12.640 --> 51:15.120
 It's got him on, this is very, very controversial.

51:15.120 --> 51:16.640
 Most people didn't agree.

51:16.640 --> 51:20.080
 I don't myself agree with this teleological view,

51:20.080 --> 51:24.120
 but it is at least a beautiful speculative view

51:24.120 --> 51:26.160
 of the cosmos.

51:26.160 --> 51:30.640
 What do you think people experience?

51:30.640 --> 51:32.920
 What do they seek when they believe in God

51:32.920 --> 51:34.720
 from this kind of perspective?

51:36.200 --> 51:41.200
 I'm not an expert on thinking about God and religion.

51:41.440 --> 51:43.880
 I'm not myself religious at all.

51:43.880 --> 51:46.720
 When people sort of pray, communicate with God,

51:46.720 --> 51:48.120
 which whatever form,

51:48.120 --> 51:51.640
 I'm not speaking to sort of the practices

51:51.640 --> 51:53.800
 and the rituals of religion.

51:53.800 --> 51:56.960
 I mean the actual experience of that people

51:56.960 --> 52:00.920
 really have a deep connection with God in some cases.

52:00.920 --> 52:05.920
 What do you think that experience is?

52:06.280 --> 52:08.680
 It's so common, at least throughout the history

52:08.680 --> 52:13.680
 of civilization, that it seems like we seek that.

52:16.360 --> 52:17.960
 At the very least, it is an interesting

52:17.960 --> 52:19.600
 conscious experience that people have

52:19.600 --> 52:24.600
 when they experience religious awe or prayer and so on.

52:24.600 --> 52:27.200
 Neuroscientists have tried to examine

52:27.200 --> 52:30.160
 what bits of the brain are active and so on.

52:30.160 --> 52:32.120
 But yeah, there's this deeper question

52:32.120 --> 52:34.800
 of what are people looking for when they're doing this?

52:34.800 --> 52:38.440
 And like I said, I've got no real expertise on this,

52:38.440 --> 52:40.920
 but it does seem that one thing people are after

52:40.920 --> 52:43.240
 is a sense of meaning and value,

52:43.240 --> 52:48.160
 a sense of connection to something greater than themselves

52:48.160 --> 52:50.280
 that will give their lives meaning and value.

52:50.280 --> 52:52.600
 And maybe the thought is if there is a God,

52:52.600 --> 52:56.120
 then God somehow is a universal consciousness

52:56.120 --> 53:00.000
 who has invested this universe with meaning

53:01.080 --> 53:05.680
 and somehow connection to God might give your life meaning.

53:05.680 --> 53:09.840
 I guess I can kind of see the attractions of that,

53:09.840 --> 53:13.000
 but it still makes me wonder why is it exactly

53:13.000 --> 53:15.920
 that a universal consciousness, God,

53:15.920 --> 53:18.480
 would be needed to give the world meaning?

53:18.480 --> 53:21.760
 If universal consciousness can give the world meaning,

53:21.760 --> 53:25.280
 why can't local consciousness give the world meaning too?

53:25.280 --> 53:28.480
 So I think my consciousness gives my world meaning.

53:28.480 --> 53:31.080
 Is the origin of meaning for your world.

53:31.080 --> 53:33.840
 Yeah, I experience things as good or bad,

53:33.840 --> 53:37.480
 happy, sad, interesting, important.

53:37.480 --> 53:40.560
 So my consciousness invests this world with meaning.

53:40.560 --> 53:42.160
 Without any consciousness,

53:42.160 --> 53:45.320
 maybe it would be a bleak, meaningless universe.

53:45.320 --> 53:47.680
 But I don't see why I need someone else's consciousness

53:47.680 --> 53:51.480
 or even God's consciousness to give this universe meaning.

53:51.480 --> 53:53.160
 Here we are, local creatures

53:53.160 --> 53:55.160
 with our own subjective experiences.

53:55.160 --> 53:58.920
 I think we can give the universe meaning ourselves.

53:58.920 --> 54:02.000
 I mean, maybe to some people that feels inadequate.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.920
 Our own local consciousness is somehow too puny

54:04.920 --> 54:07.320
 and insignificant to invest any of this

54:07.320 --> 54:09.320
 with cosmic significance.

54:09.320 --> 54:13.680
 And maybe God gives you a sense of cosmic significance,

54:13.680 --> 54:15.720
 but I'm just speculating here.

54:15.720 --> 54:19.280
 So it's a really interesting idea

54:19.280 --> 54:23.560
 that consciousness is the thing that makes life meaningful.

54:24.800 --> 54:29.800
 If you could maybe just briefly explore that for a second.

54:30.400 --> 54:33.760
 So I suspect just from listening to you now,

54:33.760 --> 54:37.400
 you mean in an almost trivial sense,

54:37.400 --> 54:42.320
 just the day to day experiences of life have,

54:42.320 --> 54:46.920
 because of you attach identity to it,

54:46.920 --> 54:51.920
 they become, I guess I wanna ask something

54:54.600 --> 54:57.120
 I would always wanted to ask

54:57.120 --> 55:01.920
 a legit world renowned philosopher.

55:01.920 --> 55:03.440
 What is the meaning of life?

55:05.200 --> 55:08.080
 So I suspect you don't mean consciousness gives

55:08.080 --> 55:11.280
 any kind of greater meaning to it all.

55:11.280 --> 55:13.360
 And more to day to day.

55:13.360 --> 55:16.240
 But is there a greater meaning to it all?

55:16.240 --> 55:20.920
 I think life has meaning for us because we are conscious.

55:20.920 --> 55:24.120
 So without consciousness, no meaning,

55:24.120 --> 55:27.280
 consciousness invests our life with meaning.

55:27.280 --> 55:30.680
 So consciousness is the source of the meaning of life,

55:30.680 --> 55:33.320
 but I wouldn't say consciousness itself

55:33.320 --> 55:34.760
 is the meaning of life.

55:34.760 --> 55:36.960
 I'd say what's meaningful in life

55:36.960 --> 55:40.000
 is basically what we find meaningful,

55:40.000 --> 55:42.640
 what we experience as meaningful.

55:42.640 --> 55:46.280
 So if you find meaning and fulfillment and value

55:46.280 --> 55:49.080
 in say, intellectual work, like understanding,

55:49.080 --> 55:51.720
 then that's a very significant part

55:51.720 --> 55:53.200
 of the meaning of life for you.

55:53.200 --> 55:55.680
 If you find that in social connections

55:55.680 --> 55:57.400
 or in raising a family,

55:57.400 --> 55:58.960
 then that's the meaning of life for you.

55:58.960 --> 56:02.080
 The meaning kind of comes from what you value

56:02.080 --> 56:04.040
 as a conscious creature.

56:04.040 --> 56:05.280
 So I think there's no, on this view,

56:05.280 --> 56:07.480
 there's no universal solution.

56:08.640 --> 56:10.160
 No universal answer to the question,

56:10.160 --> 56:11.480
 what is the meaning of life?

56:11.480 --> 56:13.520
 The meaning of life is where you find it

56:13.520 --> 56:14.600
 as a conscious creature,

56:14.600 --> 56:18.040
 but it's consciousness that somehow makes value possible.

56:18.040 --> 56:21.000
 Experiencing some things as good or as bad

56:21.000 --> 56:22.840
 or as meaningful,

56:22.840 --> 56:24.600
 something comes from within consciousness.

56:24.600 --> 56:28.760
 So you think consciousness is a crucial component,

56:28.760 --> 56:33.520
 ingredient of assigning value to things?

56:33.520 --> 56:36.080
 I mean, it's kind of a fairly strong intuition

56:36.080 --> 56:37.520
 that without consciousness,

56:37.520 --> 56:39.920
 there wouldn't really be any value

56:39.920 --> 56:44.600
 if we just had a purely universe of unconscious creatures.

56:44.600 --> 56:47.680
 Would anything be better or worse than anything else?

56:47.680 --> 56:50.320
 Certainly when it comes to ethical dilemmas,

56:50.320 --> 56:53.160
 you know about the old trolley problem.

56:53.160 --> 56:56.240
 Do you kill one person

56:56.240 --> 56:59.600
 or do you switch to the other track to kill five?

56:59.600 --> 57:01.680
 Well, I've got a variant on this,

57:01.680 --> 57:03.440
 the zombie trolley problem,

57:03.440 --> 57:06.720
 where there's a one conscious being on one track

57:06.720 --> 57:09.120
 and five humanoid zombies.

57:09.120 --> 57:12.880
 Let's make them robots who are not conscious

57:12.880 --> 57:15.520
 on the other track.

57:15.520 --> 57:16.640
 Do you, given that choice,

57:16.640 --> 57:17.920
 do you kill the one conscious being

57:17.920 --> 57:21.040
 or the five unconscious robots?

57:21.040 --> 57:23.360
 Most people have a fairly clear intuition here.

57:23.360 --> 57:25.560
 Kill the unconscious beings

57:25.560 --> 57:28.720
 because they basically, they don't have a meaningful life.

57:28.720 --> 57:33.720
 They're not really persons, conscious beings at all.

57:33.760 --> 57:36.640
 We don't have good intuition

57:36.640 --> 57:41.640
 about something like an unconscious being.

57:42.040 --> 57:46.720
 So in philosophical terms, you referred to as a zombie.

57:46.720 --> 57:51.120
 It's a useful thought experiment construction

57:51.120 --> 57:54.920
 in philosophical terms, but we don't yet have them.

57:55.880 --> 58:00.240
 So that's kind of what we may be able to create with robots.

58:00.240 --> 58:05.240
 And I don't necessarily know what that even means.

58:05.240 --> 58:07.280
 Yeah, they're merely hypothetical.

58:07.280 --> 58:09.640
 For now, they're just a thought experiment.

58:09.640 --> 58:11.040
 They may never be possible.

58:11.040 --> 58:13.480
 I mean, the extreme case of a zombie

58:13.480 --> 58:16.400
 is a being which is physically, functionally,

58:16.400 --> 58:19.520
 behaviorally identical to me, but not conscious.

58:19.520 --> 58:20.560
 That's a mere,

58:20.560 --> 58:23.520
 I don't think that could ever be built in this universe.

58:23.520 --> 58:24.840
 The question is just could we,

58:24.840 --> 58:27.000
 does that hypothetically make sense?

58:27.000 --> 58:29.360
 That's kind of a useful contrast class

58:29.360 --> 58:31.800
 to raise questions like, why aren't we zombies?

58:31.800 --> 58:33.840
 How does it come about that we're conscious?

58:33.840 --> 58:34.960
 And we're not like that.

58:34.960 --> 58:38.640
 But there are less extreme versions of this like robots,

58:38.640 --> 58:41.560
 which are maybe not physically identical to us,

58:41.560 --> 58:43.360
 maybe not even functionally identical to us.

58:43.360 --> 58:45.360
 Maybe they've got a different architecture,

58:45.360 --> 58:47.720
 but they can do a lot of sophisticated things,

58:47.720 --> 58:51.160
 maybe carry on a conversation, but they're not conscious.

58:51.160 --> 58:52.160
 And that's not so far out.

58:52.160 --> 58:54.920
 We've got simple computer systems,

58:54.920 --> 58:57.400
 at least tending in that direction now.

58:57.400 --> 59:01.120
 And presumably this is gonna get more and more sophisticated

59:01.120 --> 59:05.320
 over years to come where we may have some pretty,

59:05.320 --> 59:07.240
 it's at least quite straightforward to conceive

59:07.240 --> 59:11.160
 of some pretty sophisticated robot systems

59:11.160 --> 59:14.800
 that can use language and be fairly high functioning

59:14.800 --> 59:16.400
 without consciousness at all.

59:16.400 --> 59:17.800
 Then I stipulate that.

59:17.800 --> 59:21.600
 I mean, we've caused, there's this tricky question

59:21.600 --> 59:23.680
 of how you would know whether they're conscious.

59:23.680 --> 59:25.000
 But let's say we've somehow solved that.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.120
 And we know that these high functioning robots

59:27.120 --> 59:27.960
 aren't conscious.

59:27.960 --> 59:30.240
 Then the question is, do they have moral status?

59:30.240 --> 59:31.840
 Does it matter how we treat them?

59:33.480 --> 59:35.760
 What does moral status mean, sir?

59:35.760 --> 59:37.160
 Basically it's that question.

59:37.160 --> 59:38.480
 Can they suffer?

59:38.480 --> 59:41.040
 Does it matter how we treat them?

59:41.040 --> 59:46.040
 For example, if I mistreat this glass, this cup

59:46.040 --> 59:49.760
 by shattering it, then that's bad.

59:49.760 --> 59:50.600
 Why is it bad though?

59:50.600 --> 59:51.440
 It's gonna make a mess.

59:51.440 --> 59:53.600
 It's gonna be annoying for me and my partner.

59:53.600 --> 59:55.920
 And so it's not bad for the cup.

59:55.920 --> 59:59.560
 No one would say the cup itself has moral status.

59:59.560 --> 1:00:04.560
 Hey, you hurt the cup and that's doing it a moral harm.

1:00:07.680 --> 1:00:09.880
 Likewise, plants, well, again, if they're not conscious,

1:00:09.880 --> 1:00:11.960
 most people think by uprooting a plant,

1:00:11.960 --> 1:00:13.520
 you're not harming it.

1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:16.160
 But if a being is conscious on the other hand,

1:00:16.160 --> 1:00:17.200
 then you are harming it.

1:00:17.200 --> 1:00:22.200
 So Siri, or I dare not say the name of Alexa.

1:00:24.960 --> 1:00:28.600
 Anyway, so we don't think we're morally harming Alexa

1:00:28.600 --> 1:00:30.440
 by turning her off or disconnecting her

1:00:30.440 --> 1:00:34.080
 or even destroying her, whether it's the system

1:00:34.080 --> 1:00:36.160
 or the underlying software system,

1:00:36.160 --> 1:00:39.040
 because we don't really think she's conscious.

1:00:39.040 --> 1:00:42.400
 On the other hand, you move to like the disembodied being

1:00:42.400 --> 1:00:45.520
 in the movie, her, Samantha,

1:00:45.520 --> 1:00:47.480
 I guess she was kind of presented as conscious.

1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:49.760
 And then if you destroyed her,

1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:51.760
 you'd certainly be committing a serious harm.

1:00:51.760 --> 1:00:55.200
 So I think our strong sense is if a being is conscious

1:00:55.200 --> 1:00:57.440
 and can undergo subjective experiences,

1:00:57.440 --> 1:01:00.360
 then it matters morally how we treat them.

1:01:00.360 --> 1:01:03.040
 So if a robot is conscious, it matters,

1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:05.360
 but if a robot is not conscious,

1:01:05.360 --> 1:01:07.160
 then they're basically just meat or a machine

1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:10.360
 and it doesn't matter.

1:01:10.360 --> 1:01:13.000
 So I think at least maybe how we think about this stuff

1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:13.960
 is fundamentally wrong,

1:01:13.960 --> 1:01:15.480
 but I think a lot of people

1:01:15.480 --> 1:01:17.200
 who think about this stuff seriously,

1:01:17.200 --> 1:01:18.320
 including people who think about,

1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:20.800
 say the moral treatment of animals and so on,

1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:23.360
 come to the view that consciousness

1:01:23.360 --> 1:01:25.760
 is ultimately kind of the line between systems

1:01:25.760 --> 1:01:29.320
 that where we have to take them into account

1:01:29.320 --> 1:01:32.240
 and thinking morally about how we act

1:01:32.240 --> 1:01:34.440
 and systems for which we don't.

1:01:34.440 --> 1:01:38.560
 And I think I've seen you the writer talk about

1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:41.800
 the demonstration of consciousness from a system like that,

1:01:41.800 --> 1:01:46.800
 from a system like Alexa or a conversational agent

1:01:48.120 --> 1:01:51.160
 that what you would be looking for

1:01:51.160 --> 1:01:54.600
 is kind of at the very basic level

1:01:54.600 --> 1:01:58.160
 for the system to have an awareness

1:01:58.160 --> 1:02:00.440
 that I'm just a program

1:02:00.440 --> 1:02:03.880
 and yet, why do I experience this?

1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:06.160
 Or not to have that experience,

1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:08.000
 but to communicate that to you.

1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:10.680
 So that's what us humans would sound like.

1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:13.000
 If you all of a sudden woke up one day,

1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.600
 like Kafka, right, in a body of a bug or something,

1:02:15.600 --> 1:02:18.320
 but in a computer, you all of a sudden realized

1:02:18.320 --> 1:02:19.720
 you don't have a body

1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:22.480
 and yet you were feeling what you were feeling,

1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:25.080
 you would probably say those kinds of things.

1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:29.520
 So do you think a system essentially becomes conscious

1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:33.080
 by convincing us that it's conscious

1:02:34.400 --> 1:02:36.200
 through the words that I just mentioned?

1:02:36.200 --> 1:02:40.080
 So by being confused about the fact

1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:45.000
 that why am I having these experiences?

1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:45.840
 So basically.

1:02:45.840 --> 1:02:48.080
 I don't think this is what makes you conscious,

1:02:48.080 --> 1:02:50.240
 but I do think being puzzled about consciousness

1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:53.280
 is a very good sign that a system is conscious.

1:02:53.280 --> 1:02:55.600
 So if I encountered a robot

1:02:55.600 --> 1:02:58.640
 that actually seemed to be genuinely puzzled

1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:01.280
 by its own mental states

1:03:01.280 --> 1:03:04.000
 and saying, yeah, I have all these weird experiences

1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:06.320
 and I don't see how to explain them.

1:03:06.320 --> 1:03:08.720
 I know I'm just a set of silicon circuits,

1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:11.600
 but I don't see how that would give you my consciousness.

1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:13.840
 I would at least take that as some evidence

1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:16.720
 that there's some consciousness going on there.

1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:19.440
 I don't think a system needs to be puzzled

1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:21.760
 about consciousness to be conscious.

1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:24.000
 Many people aren't puzzled by their consciousness.

1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.320
 Animals don't seem to be puzzled at all.

1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:28.000
 I still think they're conscious.

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.680
 So I don't think that's a requirement on consciousness,

1:03:30.680 --> 1:03:33.360
 but I do think if we're looking for signs

1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:37.000
 for consciousness, say in AI systems,

1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.120
 one of the things that will help convince me

1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:42.920
 that an AI system is conscious is if it shows signs of,

1:03:44.080 --> 1:03:47.360
 if it shows signs of introspectively recognizing something

1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:51.280
 like consciousness and finding this philosophically puzzling

1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:54.200
 in the way that we do.

1:03:54.200 --> 1:03:55.920
 It's such an interesting thought, though,

1:03:55.920 --> 1:03:57.920
 because a lot of people sort of would,

1:03:57.920 --> 1:04:02.160
 at the Shao level, criticize the Turing test for language.

1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:07.160
 It's essentially what I heard Dan Dennett

1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:09.800
 criticize it in this kind of way,

1:04:09.800 --> 1:04:13.280
 which is it really puts a lot of emphasis on lying.

1:04:13.280 --> 1:04:17.080
 Yeah, and being able to imitate

1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:20.480
 human beings, yeah, there's this cartoon

1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:23.240
 of the AI system studying for the Turing test.

1:04:23.240 --> 1:04:26.680
 It's gotta read this book called Talk Like a Human.

1:04:26.680 --> 1:04:28.360
 It's like, man, why do I have to waste my time

1:04:28.360 --> 1:04:30.480
 learning how to imitate humans?

1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:32.280
 Maybe the AI system is gonna be way beyond

1:04:32.280 --> 1:04:33.800
 the hard problem of consciousness,

1:04:33.800 --> 1:04:34.760
 and it's gonna be just like,

1:04:34.760 --> 1:04:36.400
 why do I need to waste my time pretending

1:04:36.400 --> 1:04:39.000
 that I recognize the hard problem of consciousness

1:04:40.120 --> 1:04:42.160
 in order for people to recognize me as conscious?

1:04:42.160 --> 1:04:45.000
 Yeah, it just feels like, I guess the question is,

1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:48.320
 do you think we can ever really create

1:04:48.320 --> 1:04:49.440
 a test for consciousness?

1:04:49.440 --> 1:04:53.920
 Because it feels like we're very human centric,

1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:57.600
 and so the only way we would be convinced

1:04:57.600 --> 1:05:00.880
 that something is conscious is basically

1:05:00.880 --> 1:05:05.520
 the thing demonstrates the illusion of consciousness,

1:05:06.440 --> 1:05:10.320
 that we can never really know whether it's conscious or not,

1:05:10.320 --> 1:05:14.800
 and in fact, that almost feels like it doesn't matter then,

1:05:14.800 --> 1:05:18.560
 or does it still matter to you that something is conscious

1:05:18.560 --> 1:05:20.720
 or it demonstrates consciousness?

1:05:20.720 --> 1:05:22.840
 You still see that fundamental distinction.

1:05:22.840 --> 1:05:24.880
 I think to a lot of people,

1:05:24.880 --> 1:05:27.400
 whether a system is conscious or not

1:05:27.400 --> 1:05:28.920
 matters hugely for many things,

1:05:28.920 --> 1:05:33.080
 like how we treat it, can it suffer, and so on,

1:05:33.080 --> 1:05:35.080
 but still, that leaves open the question,

1:05:35.080 --> 1:05:36.800
 how can we ever know?

1:05:36.800 --> 1:05:38.480
 And it's true that it's awfully hard

1:05:38.480 --> 1:05:40.600
 to see how we can know for sure

1:05:40.600 --> 1:05:42.360
 whether a system is conscious.

1:05:42.360 --> 1:05:44.880
 I suspect that sociologically,

1:05:44.880 --> 1:05:46.280
 the thing that's gonna convince us

1:05:46.280 --> 1:05:50.080
 that a system is conscious is, in part,

1:05:50.080 --> 1:05:53.880
 things like social interaction, conversation, and so on,

1:05:53.880 --> 1:05:56.040
 where they seem to be conscious,

1:05:56.040 --> 1:05:57.680
 they talk about their conscious states

1:05:57.680 --> 1:06:00.040
 or just talk about being happy or sad

1:06:00.040 --> 1:06:02.800
 or finding things meaningful or being in pain.

1:06:02.800 --> 1:06:06.640
 That will tend to convince us if we don't,

1:06:06.640 --> 1:06:08.360
 if a system genuinely seems to be conscious,

1:06:08.360 --> 1:06:10.000
 we don't treat it as such,

1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:11.960
 eventually it's gonna seem like a strange form

1:06:11.960 --> 1:06:14.720
 of racism or speciesism or somehow,

1:06:14.720 --> 1:06:16.320
 not to acknowledge them as conscious.

1:06:16.320 --> 1:06:17.760
 I truly believe that, by the way.

1:06:17.760 --> 1:06:20.440
 I believe that there is going to be

1:06:21.280 --> 1:06:23.240
 something akin to the Civil Rights Movement,

1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:24.720
 but for robots.

1:06:25.680 --> 1:06:30.000
 I think the moment you have a Roomba say,

1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:32.840
 please don't kick me, that hurts, just say it.

1:06:32.840 --> 1:06:33.840
 Yeah.

1:06:33.840 --> 1:06:37.440
 I think that will fundamentally change

1:06:37.440 --> 1:06:40.320
 the fabric of our society.

1:06:40.320 --> 1:06:41.160
 I think you're probably right,

1:06:41.160 --> 1:06:42.200
 although it's gonna be very tricky

1:06:42.200 --> 1:06:44.920
 because, just say we've got the technology

1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:47.240
 where these conscious beings can just be created

1:06:47.240 --> 1:06:51.820
 and multiplied by the thousands by flicking a switch.

1:06:54.280 --> 1:06:55.920
 The legal status is gonna be different,

1:06:55.920 --> 1:06:58.100
 but ultimately their moral status ought to be the same,

1:06:58.100 --> 1:07:02.880
 and yeah, the civil rights issue is gonna be a huge mess.

1:07:03.680 --> 1:07:06.680
 So if one day somebody clones you,

1:07:06.680 --> 1:07:10.520
 another very real possibility.

1:07:10.520 --> 1:07:13.760
 In fact, I find the conversation between

1:07:13.760 --> 1:07:18.760
 two copies of David Chalmers quite interesting.

1:07:21.400 --> 1:07:22.240
 Very thought.

1:07:22.240 --> 1:07:25.120
 Who is this idiot?

1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:26.520
 He's not making any sense.

1:07:26.520 --> 1:07:30.880
 So what, do you think he would be conscious?

1:07:32.320 --> 1:07:34.480
 I do think he would be conscious.

1:07:34.480 --> 1:07:35.760
 I do think in some sense,

1:07:35.760 --> 1:07:37.000
 I'm not sure it would be me,

1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.960
 there would be two different beings at this point.

1:07:39.960 --> 1:07:41.240
 I think they'd both be conscious

1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:45.800
 and they both have many of the same mental properties.

1:07:45.800 --> 1:07:49.400
 I think they both in a way have the same moral status.

1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:51.560
 It'd be wrong to hurt either of them

1:07:51.560 --> 1:07:54.560
 or to kill them and so on.

1:07:54.560 --> 1:07:55.960
 Still, there's some sense in which probably

1:07:55.960 --> 1:07:58.480
 their legal status would have to be different.

1:07:58.480 --> 1:08:01.600
 If I'm the original and that one's just a clone,

1:08:01.600 --> 1:08:03.280
 then creating a clone of me,

1:08:03.280 --> 1:08:05.000
 presumably the clone doesn't, for example,

1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:08.600
 automatically own the stuff that I own

1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:13.600
 or I've got a certain connect,

1:08:14.400 --> 1:08:16.400
 the things that the people I interact with,

1:08:16.400 --> 1:08:19.120
 my family, my partner and so on,

1:08:19.120 --> 1:08:21.120
 I'm gonna somehow be connected to them

1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:24.560
 in a way in which the clone isn't, so.

1:08:24.560 --> 1:08:26.400
 Because you came slightly first?

1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:27.240
 Yeah.

1:08:27.240 --> 1:08:30.040
 Because a clone would argue that they have

1:08:31.320 --> 1:08:33.680
 really as much of a connection.

1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:35.600
 They have all the memories of that connection.

1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:37.920
 Then a way you might say it's kind of unfair

1:08:37.920 --> 1:08:38.920
 to discriminate against them,

1:08:38.920 --> 1:08:40.080
 but say you've got an apartment

1:08:40.080 --> 1:08:41.440
 that only one person can live in

1:08:41.440 --> 1:08:44.000
 or a partner who only one person can be with.

1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:47.320
 But why should it be you, the original?

1:08:47.320 --> 1:08:49.080
 It's an interesting philosophical question,

1:08:49.080 --> 1:08:51.960
 but you might say because I actually have this history,

1:08:53.160 --> 1:08:56.880
 if I am the same person as the one that came before

1:08:56.880 --> 1:08:58.480
 and the clone is not,

1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:01.000
 then I have this history that the clone doesn't.

1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.880
 Of course, there's also the question,

1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:05.840
 isn't the clone the same person too?

1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:07.560
 This is a question about personal identity.

1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:10.720
 If I continue and I create a clone over there,

1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:14.120
 I wanna say this one is me and this one is someone else.

1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:17.960
 But you could take the view that a clone is equally me.

1:09:17.960 --> 1:09:20.120
 Of course, in a movie like Star Trek

1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:21.320
 where they have a teletransporter

1:09:21.320 --> 1:09:23.480
 basically creates clones all the time.

1:09:23.480 --> 1:09:25.960
 They treat the clones as if they're the original person.

1:09:25.960 --> 1:09:29.240
 Of course, they destroy the original body in Star Trek.

1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:31.000
 So there's only one left around

1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:32.720
 and only very occasionally do things go wrong

1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:34.680
 and you get two copies of Captain Kirk.

1:09:35.840 --> 1:09:37.800
 But somehow our legal system at the very least

1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:40.640
 is gonna have to sort out some of these issues

1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:42.200
 and that maybe that's what's moral

1:09:42.200 --> 1:09:45.920
 and what's legally acceptable are gonna come apart.

1:09:47.360 --> 1:09:50.720
 What question would you ask a clone of yourself?

1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:56.120
 Is there something useful you can find out from him

1:09:56.120 --> 1:10:00.600
 about the fundamentals of consciousness even?

1:10:00.600 --> 1:10:03.840
 I mean, kind of in principle,

1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:06.720
 I know that if it's a perfect clone,

1:10:06.720 --> 1:10:09.080
 it's gonna behave just like me.

1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:11.360
 So I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to,

1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:13.160
 I can discover whether it's a perfect clone

1:10:13.160 --> 1:10:15.240
 by seeing whether it answers like me.

1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:18.000
 But otherwise I know what I'm gonna find is a being

1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:19.440
 which is just like me,

1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:21.960
 except that it's just undergone this great shock

1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:24.480
 of discovering that it's a clone.

1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:26.520
 So just say you woke me up tomorrow and said,

1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:29.120
 hey Dave, sorry to tell you this,

1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:31.880
 but you're actually the clone

1:10:31.880 --> 1:10:34.280
 and you provided me really convincing evidence,

1:10:34.280 --> 1:10:36.920
 showed me the film of my being cloned

1:10:36.920 --> 1:10:41.360
 and then all wrapped in here being here and waking up.

1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:42.440
 So you proved to me I'm a clone,

1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:44.560
 well, yeah, okay, I would find that shocking

1:10:44.560 --> 1:10:46.480
 and who knows how I would react to this.

1:10:46.480 --> 1:10:48.640
 So maybe by talking to the clone,

1:10:48.640 --> 1:10:50.880
 I'd find something about my own psychology

1:10:50.880 --> 1:10:52.600
 that I can't find out so easily,

1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:55.440
 like how I'd react upon discovering that I'm a clone.

1:10:55.440 --> 1:10:57.840
 I could certainly ask the clone if it's conscious

1:10:57.840 --> 1:10:59.840
 and what his consciousness is like and so on,

1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:02.680
 but I guess I kind of know if it's a perfect clone,

1:11:02.680 --> 1:11:04.520
 it's gonna behave roughly like me.

1:11:04.520 --> 1:11:06.200
 Of course, at the beginning,

1:11:06.200 --> 1:11:07.040
 there'll be a question

1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:08.880
 about whether a perfect clone is possible.

1:11:08.880 --> 1:11:11.120
 So I may wanna ask it lots of questions

1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:12.400
 to see if it's consciousness

1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:14.600
 and the way it talks about its consciousness

1:11:14.600 --> 1:11:17.560
 and the way it reacts to things in general is likely.

1:11:17.560 --> 1:11:22.400
 And that will occupy us for a while.

1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:25.840
 So basic unit testing on the early models.

1:11:25.840 --> 1:11:28.520
 So if it's a perfect clone,

1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:30.760
 you say that it's gonna behave exactly like you.

1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:32.520
 So that takes us to free will.

1:11:35.640 --> 1:11:37.400
 Is there free will?

1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:41.440
 Are we able to make decisions that are not predetermined

1:11:41.440 --> 1:11:44.880
 from the initial conditions of the universe?

1:11:44.880 --> 1:11:46.680
 You know, philosophers do this annoying thing

1:11:46.680 --> 1:11:48.720
 of saying it depends what you mean.

1:11:48.720 --> 1:11:52.360
 So in this case, yeah, it really depends on what you mean,

1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:54.480
 by free will.

1:11:54.480 --> 1:11:58.680
 If you mean something which was not determined in advance,

1:11:58.680 --> 1:12:00.560
 could never have been determined,

1:12:00.560 --> 1:12:02.240
 then I don't know we have free will.

1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:03.640
 I mean, there's quantum mechanics

1:12:03.640 --> 1:12:06.160
 and who's to say if that opens up some room,

1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:09.560
 but I'm not sure we have free will in that sense.

1:12:09.560 --> 1:12:12.280
 But I'm also not sure that's the kind of free will

1:12:12.280 --> 1:12:13.840
 that really matters.

1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:15.720
 You know, what matters to us

1:12:15.720 --> 1:12:17.160
 is being able to do what we want

1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:19.800
 and to create our own futures.

1:12:19.800 --> 1:12:21.520
 We've got this distinction between having our lives

1:12:21.520 --> 1:12:26.520
 be under our control and under someone else's control.

1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:29.440
 We've got the sense of actions that we are responsible for

1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:31.160
 versus ones that we're not.

1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:33.760
 I think you can make those distinctions

1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:36.400
 even in a deterministic universe.

1:12:36.400 --> 1:12:38.280
 And this is what people call the compatibilist view

1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:41.240
 of free will, where it's compatible with determinism.

1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:42.880
 So I think for many purposes,

1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:45.520
 the kind of free will that matters

1:12:45.520 --> 1:12:48.080
 is something we can have in a deterministic universe.

1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:50.440
 And I can't see any reason in principle

1:12:50.440 --> 1:12:54.440
 why an AI system couldn't have free will of that kind.

1:12:54.440 --> 1:12:55.840
 If you mean super duper free will,

1:12:55.840 --> 1:12:57.720
 the ability to violate the laws of physics

1:12:57.720 --> 1:13:01.760
 and doing things that in principle could not be predicted.

1:13:01.760 --> 1:13:04.680
 I don't know, maybe no one has that kind of free will.

1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:09.680
 What's the connection between the reality of free will

1:13:10.040 --> 1:13:11.400
 and the experience of it,

1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:15.240
 the subjective experience in your view?

1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:17.000
 So how does consciousness connect

1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:22.000
 to the reality and the experience of free will?

1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:24.800
 It's certainly true that when we make decisions

1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:26.200
 and when we choose and so on,

1:13:26.200 --> 1:13:28.440
 we feel like we have an open future.

1:13:28.440 --> 1:13:32.440
 Feel like I could do this, I could go into philosophy

1:13:32.440 --> 1:13:36.080
 or I could go into math, I could go to a movie tonight,

1:13:36.080 --> 1:13:38.080
 I could go to a restaurant.

1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:42.600
 So we experience these things as if the future is open.

1:13:42.600 --> 1:13:44.520
 And maybe we experience ourselves

1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:49.520
 as exerting a kind of effect on the future

1:13:50.040 --> 1:13:51.680
 that somehow picking out one path

1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:54.200
 from many paths were previously open.

1:13:54.200 --> 1:13:56.080
 And you might think that actually

1:13:56.080 --> 1:13:58.080
 if we're in a deterministic universe,

1:13:58.080 --> 1:13:59.880
 there's a sense of which objectively

1:13:59.880 --> 1:14:03.720
 those paths weren't really open all along,

1:14:03.720 --> 1:14:05.800
 but subjectively they were open.

1:14:05.800 --> 1:14:07.320
 And that's, I think that's what really matters

1:14:07.320 --> 1:14:09.440
 in making a decisions where our experience

1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:14.320
 of making a decision is choosing a path for ourselves.

1:14:14.320 --> 1:14:18.120
 I mean, in general, our introspective models of the mind,

1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:20.600
 I think are generally very distorted representations

1:14:20.600 --> 1:14:21.600
 of the mind.

1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:24.200
 So it may well be that our experience of ourself

1:14:24.200 --> 1:14:27.600
 in making a decision, our experience of what's going on

1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:31.000
 doesn't terribly well mirror what's going on.

1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:33.160
 I mean, maybe there are antecedents in the brain

1:14:33.160 --> 1:14:35.200
 way before anything came into consciousness

1:14:37.760 --> 1:14:39.000
 and so on.

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.720
 Those aren't represented in our introspective model.

1:14:41.720 --> 1:14:45.880
 So in general, our experience of perception,

1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:50.600
 so I experience a perceptual image of the external world.

1:14:50.600 --> 1:14:53.360
 It's not a terribly good model of what's actually going on

1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:55.640
 in my visual cortex and so on,

1:14:55.640 --> 1:14:57.080
 which has all these layers and so on.

1:14:57.080 --> 1:14:59.800
 It's just one little snapshot of one bit of that.

1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:02.440
 So in general, introspective models

1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:05.240
 are very over oversimplified.

1:15:05.240 --> 1:15:07.200
 And it wouldn't be surprising

1:15:07.200 --> 1:15:09.160
 if that was true of free will as well.

1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:12.640
 This also incidentally can be applied to consciousness itself.

1:15:12.640 --> 1:15:13.960
 There is this very interesting view

1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:17.520
 that consciousness itself is an introspective illusion.

1:15:17.520 --> 1:15:19.440
 In fact, we're not conscious,

1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:24.280
 but the brain just has these introspective models of itself

1:15:24.280 --> 1:15:27.160
 or oversimplifies everything and represents itself

1:15:27.160 --> 1:15:31.040
 as having these special properties of consciousness.

1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:33.840
 It's a really simple way to kind of keep track of itself

1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:34.680
 and so on.

1:15:34.680 --> 1:15:36.920
 And then on the illusionist view,

1:15:36.920 --> 1:15:39.880
 yeah, that's just an illusion.

1:15:39.880 --> 1:15:42.240
 I find this view, when I find it implausible,

1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:44.840
 I do find it very attractive in some ways,

1:15:44.840 --> 1:15:46.640
 because it's easy to tell some story

1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:50.120
 about how the brain would create introspective models

1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:53.120
 of its own consciousness, of its own free will

1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:55.480
 as a way of simplifying itself.

1:15:55.480 --> 1:15:57.680
 I mean, it's a similar way when we perceive

1:15:57.680 --> 1:16:00.040
 the external world, we perceive it as having these colors

1:16:00.040 --> 1:16:02.720
 that maybe it doesn't really have,

1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:04.280
 but of course that's a really useful way

1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:06.440
 of keeping tracks, of keeping track.

1:16:06.440 --> 1:16:08.960
 Did you say that you find it not very plausible?

1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:11.880
 Because I find it both plausible

1:16:11.880 --> 1:16:14.120
 and attractive in some sense,

1:16:14.120 --> 1:16:18.920
 because I mean, that kind of view

1:16:18.920 --> 1:16:23.920
 is one that has the minimum amount of mystery around it.

1:16:25.040 --> 1:16:28.960
 You can kind of understand that kind of view.

1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:31.960
 Everything else says we don't understand

1:16:31.960 --> 1:16:33.920
 so much of this picture.

1:16:33.920 --> 1:16:36.800
 No, it is very attractive, I recently wrote an article

1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:38.600
 about this kind of issue called

1:16:38.600 --> 1:16:41.280
 the meta problem of consciousness.

1:16:41.280 --> 1:16:43.200
 The hard problem is how does a brain

1:16:43.200 --> 1:16:44.200
 give you consciousness?

1:16:44.200 --> 1:16:46.720
 The meta problem is why are we puzzled

1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:49.600
 by the hard problem of consciousness?

1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:50.960
 Because being puzzled by it,

1:16:50.960 --> 1:16:53.000
 that's ultimately a bit of behavior.

1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:54.880
 We might be able to explain that bit of behavior

1:16:54.880 --> 1:16:57.560
 as one of the easy problems, consciousness.

1:16:57.560 --> 1:17:00.560
 So maybe there'll be some computational model

1:17:00.560 --> 1:17:03.440
 that explains why we're puzzled by consciousness.

1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:05.800
 The meta problem has come up with that model.

1:17:05.800 --> 1:17:07.880
 And I've been thinking about that a lot lately.

1:17:07.880 --> 1:17:09.560
 There's some interesting stories you can tell

1:17:09.560 --> 1:17:13.600
 about why the right kind of computational system

1:17:13.600 --> 1:17:17.640
 might develop these introspective models of itself

1:17:17.640 --> 1:17:20.680
 that attributed itself, these special properties.

1:17:21.560 --> 1:17:25.320
 So that meta problem is a research program for everyone.

1:17:25.320 --> 1:17:27.000
 And then if you've got attraction

1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:31.320
 to sort of simple views, desert landscapes and so on,

1:17:31.320 --> 1:17:32.240
 then you can go all the way

1:17:32.240 --> 1:17:34.240
 with what people call illusionism

1:17:34.240 --> 1:17:37.760
 and say, in fact, consciousness itself is not real.

1:17:37.760 --> 1:17:42.400
 What is real is just these introspective models

1:17:42.400 --> 1:17:45.040
 we have that tell us that we're conscious.

1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:49.600
 So the view is very simple, very attractive, very powerful.

1:17:49.600 --> 1:17:51.240
 The trouble is, of course, it has to say

1:17:51.240 --> 1:17:55.160
 that deep down, consciousness is not real.

1:17:55.160 --> 1:17:57.960
 We're not actually experiencing right now.

1:17:57.960 --> 1:17:59.960
 And it looks like it's just contradicting

1:17:59.960 --> 1:18:02.360
 a fundamental datum of our existence.

1:18:02.360 --> 1:18:06.080
 And this is why most people find this view crazy.

1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:08.760
 Just as they find panpsychism crazy in one way,

1:18:08.760 --> 1:18:13.240
 people find illusionism crazy in another way.

1:18:13.240 --> 1:18:18.000
 But I mean, so yes, it has to deny

1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:20.640
 this fundamental datum of our existence.

1:18:20.640 --> 1:18:24.680
 Now, that makes the view sort of frankly unbelievable

1:18:24.680 --> 1:18:25.520
 for most people.

1:18:25.520 --> 1:18:28.200
 On the other hand, the view developed right

1:18:28.200 --> 1:18:31.280
 might be able to explain why we find it unbelievable.

1:18:31.280 --> 1:18:34.280
 Because these models are so deeply hardwired into our head.

1:18:34.280 --> 1:18:36.000
 And they're all integrated.

1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:38.480
 You can't escape the illusion.

1:18:38.480 --> 1:18:40.720
 And it's a crazy possibility.

1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:43.640
 Is it possible that the entirety of the universe,

1:18:43.640 --> 1:18:46.760
 our planet, all the people in New York,

1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:48.520
 all the organisms on our planet,

1:18:49.800 --> 1:18:54.440
 including me here today, are not real in that sense?

1:18:54.440 --> 1:18:59.440
 They're all part of an illusion inside of Dave Chalmers's head.

1:18:59.800 --> 1:19:02.320
 I think all this could be a simulation.

1:19:02.320 --> 1:19:04.960
 No, but not just a simulation.

1:19:04.960 --> 1:19:09.200
 Because the simulation kind of is outside of you.

1:19:09.200 --> 1:19:10.120
 A dream?

1:19:10.120 --> 1:19:12.040
 What if it's all an illusion?

1:19:12.040 --> 1:19:14.560
 Yes, a dream that you're experiencing.

1:19:14.560 --> 1:19:18.880
 That's, it's all in your mind, right?

1:19:18.880 --> 1:19:23.040
 Is that, can you take illusionism that far?

1:19:23.040 --> 1:19:26.840
 Well, there's illusionism about the external world

1:19:26.840 --> 1:19:28.440
 and illusionism about consciousness.

1:19:28.440 --> 1:19:30.200
 And these might go in different.

1:19:30.200 --> 1:19:31.800
 Illusionism about the external world

1:19:31.800 --> 1:19:34.120
 kind of takes you back to Descartes.

1:19:34.120 --> 1:19:37.400
 And yeah, could all this be produced by an evil demon?

1:19:37.400 --> 1:19:39.560
 Descartes himself also had the dream argument.

1:19:39.560 --> 1:19:42.040
 He said, how do you know you're not dreaming right now?

1:19:42.040 --> 1:19:43.720
 How do you know this is not an amazing dream?

1:19:43.720 --> 1:19:46.320
 And it's at least a possibility that yeah,

1:19:46.320 --> 1:19:49.840
 this could be some super duper complex dream

1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:51.640
 in the next universe up.

1:19:51.640 --> 1:19:56.320
 I guess though, my attitude is that just as,

1:19:57.200 --> 1:20:00.520
 when Descartes thought that if the evil demon was doing it,

1:20:00.520 --> 1:20:01.440
 it's not real.

1:20:01.440 --> 1:20:04.360
 A lot of people these days say if a simulation is doing it,

1:20:04.360 --> 1:20:05.560
 it's not real.

1:20:05.560 --> 1:20:08.040
 As I was saying before, I think even if it's a simulation,

1:20:08.040 --> 1:20:09.400
 that doesn't stop this from being real.

1:20:09.400 --> 1:20:11.440
 It just tells us what the world is made of.

1:20:11.440 --> 1:20:12.960
 Likewise, if it's a dream,

1:20:12.960 --> 1:20:15.840
 it could turn out that all this is like my dream

1:20:15.840 --> 1:20:19.080
 created by my brain in the next universe up.

1:20:19.080 --> 1:20:21.920
 My own view is that wouldn't stop this physical world

1:20:21.920 --> 1:20:22.760
 from being real.

1:20:22.760 --> 1:20:26.040
 It would turn out this cup at the most fundamental level

1:20:26.040 --> 1:20:28.880
 was made of a bit of say my consciousness

1:20:28.880 --> 1:20:31.920
 in the dreaming mind at the next level up.

1:20:31.920 --> 1:20:35.400
 Maybe that would give you a kind of weird kind of panpsychism

1:20:35.400 --> 1:20:39.360
 about reality, but it wouldn't show that the cup isn't real.

1:20:39.360 --> 1:20:42.120
 It would just tell us it's ultimately made of processes

1:20:42.120 --> 1:20:43.200
 in my dreaming mind.

1:20:43.200 --> 1:20:48.200
 So I'd resist the idea that if the physical world is a dream,

1:20:48.200 --> 1:20:50.640
 then it's an illusion.

1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:52.200
 That's right.

1:20:52.200 --> 1:20:54.960
 By the way, perhaps you have an interesting thought

1:20:54.960 --> 1:20:55.800
 about it.

1:20:55.800 --> 1:21:00.320
 Why is Descartes demon or genius considered evil?

1:21:02.200 --> 1:21:04.560
 Why couldn't have been a benevolent one

1:21:04.560 --> 1:21:05.840
 that had the same powers?

1:21:05.840 --> 1:21:08.800
 Yeah, I mean, Descartes called it the malign genie,

1:21:08.800 --> 1:21:12.240
 the evil genie or evil genius.

1:21:12.240 --> 1:21:14.280
 Malign, I guess was the word.

1:21:14.280 --> 1:21:15.880
 But yeah, it's an interesting question.

1:21:15.880 --> 1:21:20.600
 I mean, a later philosophy, Barclay said,

1:21:20.600 --> 1:21:25.400
 no, in fact, all this is done by God.

1:21:25.400 --> 1:21:30.400
 God actually supplies you all of these perceptions

1:21:30.400 --> 1:21:33.880
 and ideas and that's how physical reality is sustained.

1:21:33.880 --> 1:21:36.840
 And interestingly, Barclay's God is doing something

1:21:36.840 --> 1:21:38.160
 that doesn't look so different

1:21:38.160 --> 1:21:41.200
 from what Descartes evil demon was doing.

1:21:41.200 --> 1:21:43.560
 It's just that Descartes thought it was deception

1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:46.240
 and Barclay thought it was not.

1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:49.360
 And I'm actually more sympathetic to Barclay here.

1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:54.800
 Yeah, this evil demon may be trying to deceive you,

1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:56.800
 but I think, okay, well, the evil demon

1:21:56.800 --> 1:22:01.200
 may just be working under a false philosophical theory.

1:22:01.200 --> 1:22:02.800
 It thinks it's deceiving you, it's wrong.

1:22:02.800 --> 1:22:04.200
 It's like there's machines in the matrix.

1:22:04.200 --> 1:22:06.120
 They thought they were deceiving you

1:22:06.120 --> 1:22:07.040
 that all this stuff is real.

1:22:07.040 --> 1:22:11.600
 I think, no, if we're in a matrix, it's all still real.

1:22:11.600 --> 1:22:15.080
 Yeah, the philosopher O.K. Bousma had a nice story

1:22:15.080 --> 1:22:19.000
 about this about 50 years ago, about Descartes evil demon,

1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:21.600
 where he said this demon spends all its time

1:22:21.600 --> 1:22:24.560
 trying to fool people, but fails

1:22:24.560 --> 1:22:26.600
 because somehow all the demon ends up doing

1:22:26.600 --> 1:22:30.160
 is constructing realities for people.

1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:33.000
 So yeah, I think that maybe it's a very natural

1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:35.040
 to take this view that if we're in a simulation

1:22:35.040 --> 1:22:38.560
 or evil demon scenario or something,

1:22:38.560 --> 1:22:40.640
 then none of this is real.

1:22:40.640 --> 1:22:43.760
 But I think it may be ultimately a philosophical mistake,

1:22:43.760 --> 1:22:46.640
 especially if you take on board sort of the view of reality

1:22:46.640 --> 1:22:50.000
 where what matters to reality is really its structure,

1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.800
 something like its mathematical structure and so on,

1:22:52.800 --> 1:22:54.600
 which seems to be the view that a lot of people take

1:22:54.600 --> 1:22:56.360
 from contemporary physics.

1:22:56.360 --> 1:22:57.960
 And it looks like you can find

1:22:57.960 --> 1:23:01.320
 all that mathematical structure in a simulation,

1:23:01.320 --> 1:23:03.520
 maybe even in a dream and so on.

1:23:03.520 --> 1:23:05.400
 So as long as that structure is real,

1:23:05.400 --> 1:23:08.640
 I would say that's enough for the physical world to be real.

1:23:08.640 --> 1:23:10.040
 Yeah, the physical world may turn out

1:23:10.040 --> 1:23:13.120
 to be somewhat more intangible than we had thought

1:23:13.120 --> 1:23:15.240
 and have a surprising nature of it.

1:23:15.240 --> 1:23:18.120
 We're already gotten very used to that from modern science.

1:23:19.560 --> 1:23:21.120
 See, you've kind of alluded

1:23:21.120 --> 1:23:23.160
 that you don't have to have consciousness

1:23:23.160 --> 1:23:25.440
 for high levels of intelligence,

1:23:25.440 --> 1:23:29.840
 but to create truly general intelligence systems,

1:23:29.840 --> 1:23:32.320
 AGI systems at human level intelligence

1:23:32.320 --> 1:23:34.960
 and perhaps super human level intelligence,

1:23:34.960 --> 1:23:37.040
 you've talked about that you feel like

1:23:37.040 --> 1:23:38.960
 that kind of thing might be very far away,

1:23:38.960 --> 1:23:43.440
 but nevertheless, when we reached that point,

1:23:43.440 --> 1:23:46.040
 do you think consciousness

1:23:46.040 --> 1:23:49.440
 from an engineering perspective is needed

1:23:49.440 --> 1:23:53.400
 or at least highly beneficial for creating an AGI system?

1:23:54.440 --> 1:23:57.680
 Yeah, no one knows what consciousness is for functionally.

1:23:57.680 --> 1:24:00.880
 So right now there's no specific thing we can point to

1:24:00.880 --> 1:24:05.160
 and say, you need consciousness for that.

1:24:05.160 --> 1:24:06.560
 So my inclination is to believe

1:24:06.560 --> 1:24:09.320
 that in principle AGI is possible.

1:24:09.320 --> 1:24:11.240
 The very least I don't see why

1:24:11.240 --> 1:24:13.240
 someone couldn't simulate a brain,

1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:16.120
 ultimately have a computational system

1:24:16.120 --> 1:24:18.240
 that produces all of our behavior.

1:24:18.240 --> 1:24:19.440
 And if that's possible,

1:24:19.440 --> 1:24:22.800
 I'm sure vastly many other computational systems

1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:27.160
 of equal or greater sophistication are possible

1:24:27.160 --> 1:24:29.400
 with all of our cognitive functions and more.

1:24:29.400 --> 1:24:31.160
 My inclination is to think that

1:24:32.280 --> 1:24:35.400
 once you've got all these cognitive functions,

1:24:35.400 --> 1:24:39.720
 perception, attention, reasoning,

1:24:39.720 --> 1:24:44.440
 introspection, language, emotion, and so on,

1:24:44.440 --> 1:24:49.160
 it's very likely you'll have consciousness as well.

1:24:49.160 --> 1:24:50.600
 So at least it's very hard for me to see

1:24:50.600 --> 1:24:52.720
 how you'd have a system that had all those things

1:24:52.720 --> 1:24:55.640
 while bypassing somehow conscious.

1:24:55.640 --> 1:25:00.160
 So just naturally it's integrated quite naturally.

1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:02.960
 There's a lot of overlap about the kind of function

1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:04.840
 that required to achieve each of those things

1:25:04.840 --> 1:25:07.640
 that's, so you can't disentangle them

1:25:07.640 --> 1:25:08.480
 even when you're recreating.

1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:09.680
 It seems to, at least in us,

1:25:09.680 --> 1:25:13.320
 but we don't know what the causal role of consciousness

1:25:13.320 --> 1:25:14.600
 in the physical world, what it does.

1:25:14.600 --> 1:25:15.960
 I mean, just say it turns out

1:25:15.960 --> 1:25:17.720
 consciousness does something very specific

1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:20.560
 in the physical world like collapsing wave functions

1:25:20.560 --> 1:25:24.240
 as on one common interpretation of quantum mechanics.

1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:25.680
 Then ultimately we might find some place

1:25:25.680 --> 1:25:27.560
 where it actually makes a difference

1:25:27.560 --> 1:25:28.680
 and we could say, ah,

1:25:28.680 --> 1:25:30.520
 here is where in collapsing wave functions

1:25:30.520 --> 1:25:32.760
 it's driving the behavior of a system.

1:25:32.760 --> 1:25:37.080
 And maybe it could even turn out that for AGI,

1:25:37.080 --> 1:25:39.200
 you'd need something playing that.

1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:41.200
 I mean, if you wanted to connect this to free will,

1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:43.520
 some people think consciousness collapsing wave functions,

1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:47.640
 that would be how the conscious mind exerts effect

1:25:47.640 --> 1:25:50.440
 on the physical world and exerts its free will.

1:25:50.440 --> 1:25:53.520
 And maybe it could turn out that any AGI

1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:56.680
 that didn't utilize that mechanism would be limited

1:25:56.680 --> 1:25:59.760
 in the kinds of functionality that it had.

1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:02.240
 I don't myself find that plausible.

1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:05.000
 I think probably that functionality could be simulated.

1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:07.760
 But you can imagine once we had a very specific idea

1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:10.440
 about the role of consciousness in the physical world,

1:26:10.440 --> 1:26:14.080
 this would have some impact on the capacity of AGI's.

1:26:14.080 --> 1:26:17.880
 And if it was a role that could not be duplicated elsewhere,

1:26:17.880 --> 1:26:22.560
 then we'd have to find some way to either

1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:24.640
 get consciousness in the system to play that role

1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:25.520
 or to simulate it.

1:26:25.520 --> 1:26:29.080
 If we can isolate a particular role to consciousness,

1:26:29.080 --> 1:26:33.920
 of course, it seems like an incredibly difficult thing.

1:26:35.120 --> 1:26:39.600
 Do you have worries about existential threats

1:26:39.600 --> 1:26:44.600
 of conscious intelligent beings that are not us?

1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:49.440
 So certainly, I'm sure you're worried about us

1:26:50.640 --> 1:26:52.840
 from an existential threat perspective,

1:26:52.840 --> 1:26:55.400
 but outside of us, AI systems.

1:26:55.400 --> 1:26:56.440
 There's a couple of different kinds

1:26:56.440 --> 1:26:58.160
 of existential threats here.

1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:01.400
 One is an existential threat to consciousness generally.

1:27:01.400 --> 1:27:04.000
 I mean, yes, I care about humans

1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:05.960
 and the survival of humans and so on,

1:27:05.960 --> 1:27:10.360
 but just say it turns out that eventually we're replaced

1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:12.680
 by some artificial beings that aren't humans,

1:27:12.680 --> 1:27:15.480
 but are somehow our successors.

1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:16.800
 They still have good lives.

1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:19.200
 They still do interesting and wonderful things

1:27:19.200 --> 1:27:20.600
 with the universe.

1:27:20.600 --> 1:27:23.440
 I don't think that's not so bad.

1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:24.560
 That's just our successors.

1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:26.480
 We were one stage in evolution.

1:27:26.480 --> 1:27:29.720
 Something different, maybe better came next.

1:27:29.720 --> 1:27:33.280
 If on the other hand, all of consciousness was wiped out,

1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:36.760
 that would be a very serious moral disaster.

1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:40.880
 One way that could happen is by all intelligent life

1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:42.080
 being wiped out.

1:27:42.080 --> 1:27:43.320
 And many people think that, yeah,

1:27:43.320 --> 1:27:47.680
 once you get to humans and AIs and amazing sophistication

1:27:47.680 --> 1:27:51.000
 where everyone has got the ability to create weapons

1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:55.560
 that can destroy the whole universe just by pressing a button,

1:27:55.560 --> 1:28:00.560
 then maybe it's inevitable all intelligent life will die out.

1:28:00.640 --> 1:28:03.720
 That would certainly be a disaster.

1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:06.040
 And we've got to think very hard about how to avoid that.

1:28:06.040 --> 1:28:08.040
 But yeah, another interesting kind of disaster

1:28:08.040 --> 1:28:12.160
 is that maybe intelligent life is not wiped out,

1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:14.920
 but all consciousness is wiped out.

1:28:14.920 --> 1:28:16.480
 So just say your thought,

1:28:16.480 --> 1:28:18.000
 unlike what I was saying a moment ago,

1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:21.400
 that there are two different kinds of intelligent systems,

1:28:21.400 --> 1:28:25.400
 some which are conscious and some which are not.

1:28:25.400 --> 1:28:28.840
 And just say it turns out that we create AGI

1:28:28.840 --> 1:28:30.800
 with a high degree of intelligence,

1:28:30.800 --> 1:28:34.080
 meaning high degree of sophistication and its behavior,

1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:37.080
 but with no consciousness at all.

1:28:37.080 --> 1:28:39.680
 That AGI could take over the world maybe,

1:28:39.680 --> 1:28:42.760
 but then there'd be no consciousness in this world.

1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:44.400
 This would be a world of zombies.

1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:47.000
 Some people have called this the zombie apocalypse

1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:50.240
 because it's an apocalypse for consciousness.

1:28:50.240 --> 1:28:51.200
 Consciousness is gone.

1:28:51.200 --> 1:28:53.120
 You've merely got this super intelligent,

1:28:53.120 --> 1:28:54.560
 nonconscious robots.

1:28:54.560 --> 1:28:58.040
 And I would say that's a moral disaster in the same way,

1:28:58.040 --> 1:28:59.840
 in almost the same way that the world

1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:02.240
 with no intelligent life is a moral disaster.

1:29:02.240 --> 1:29:06.720
 All value and meaning may be gone from that world.

1:29:06.720 --> 1:29:09.000
 So these are both threats to watch out for.

1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:11.720
 Now, my own view is if you get super intelligence,

1:29:11.720 --> 1:29:13.720
 you're almost certainly gonna bring consciousness with it.

1:29:13.720 --> 1:29:15.840
 So I hope that's not gonna happen.

1:29:15.840 --> 1:29:18.400
 But of course, I don't understand consciousness.

1:29:18.400 --> 1:29:20.240
 No one understands consciousness.

1:29:20.240 --> 1:29:21.680
 This is one reason for,

1:29:21.680 --> 1:29:23.400
 this is one reason at least among many

1:29:23.400 --> 1:29:25.520
 for thinking very seriously about consciousness

1:29:25.520 --> 1:29:27.960
 and thinking about the kind of future

1:29:27.960 --> 1:29:32.960
 we want to create in a world with humans and or AIs.

1:29:33.160 --> 1:29:35.760
 How do you feel about the possibility

1:29:35.760 --> 1:29:39.920
 if consciousness so naturally does come with AGI systems

1:29:39.920 --> 1:29:42.600
 that we are just a step in the evolution?

1:29:42.600 --> 1:29:47.240
 That we will be just something, a blimp on the record

1:29:47.240 --> 1:29:49.040
 that'll be studied in books

1:29:49.040 --> 1:29:51.720
 by the AGI systems centuries from now?

1:29:51.720 --> 1:29:55.400
 I mean, I think I'd probably be okay with that,

1:29:55.400 --> 1:29:58.480
 especially if somehow humans are continuous with AGI.

1:29:58.480 --> 1:30:01.560
 I mean, I think something like this is inevitable.

1:30:01.560 --> 1:30:03.960
 The very least humans are gonna be transformed.

1:30:03.960 --> 1:30:06.480
 We're gonna be augmented by technology.

1:30:06.480 --> 1:30:08.840
 It's already happening in all kinds of ways.

1:30:08.840 --> 1:30:11.520
 We're gonna be transformed by technology

1:30:11.520 --> 1:30:13.160
 where our brains are gonna be uploaded

1:30:13.160 --> 1:30:15.880
 and computationally enhanced.

1:30:15.880 --> 1:30:18.040
 And eventually that line between what's a human

1:30:18.040 --> 1:30:23.040
 and what's an AI may be kind of hard to draw.

1:30:23.400 --> 1:30:24.800
 How much does it matter, for example,

1:30:24.800 --> 1:30:28.680
 that some future being a thousand years from now

1:30:28.680 --> 1:30:32.120
 that somehow descended from us actually still has biology?

1:30:32.120 --> 1:30:34.200
 I think it would be nice if you kind of point

1:30:34.200 --> 1:30:36.160
 to its cognitive system, point to some parts

1:30:36.160 --> 1:30:40.840
 that had some roots in us and trace a continuous line there.

1:30:40.840 --> 1:30:43.720
 That would be selfishly nice for me to think that,

1:30:43.720 --> 1:30:46.480
 okay, I'm connected to this thread line

1:30:46.480 --> 1:30:48.120
 through the future of the world,

1:30:48.120 --> 1:30:50.600
 but if it turns out, okay, there's a jump there.

1:30:50.600 --> 1:30:53.760
 They found a better way to design cognitive systems.

1:30:53.760 --> 1:30:55.440
 They designed a wholly new kind of thing.

1:30:55.440 --> 1:30:59.800
 And the only line is some causal chain of designing

1:30:59.800 --> 1:31:03.120
 and systems that design better systems.

1:31:03.120 --> 1:31:04.800
 Is that so much worse?

1:31:04.800 --> 1:31:05.640
 I don't know.

1:31:05.640 --> 1:31:08.360
 We're still at least part of a causal chain of design.

1:31:08.360 --> 1:31:09.560
 And yes, they're not humans,

1:31:09.560 --> 1:31:11.640
 but still they're our successes.

1:31:11.640 --> 1:31:14.440
 So, I mean, ultimately I think it's probably inevitable

1:31:14.440 --> 1:31:16.760
 that something like that will happen.

1:31:16.760 --> 1:31:19.920
 And at least we were part of the process.

1:31:19.920 --> 1:31:23.400
 It'd be nice if they still cared enough about us

1:31:23.400 --> 1:31:28.240
 to maybe to engage with our arguments.

1:31:28.240 --> 1:31:30.080
 I'm really hoping that the AGI's are gonna solve

1:31:30.080 --> 1:31:31.760
 all the problems of philosophy.

1:31:31.760 --> 1:31:35.040
 They'll come back and read all this crappy work

1:31:35.040 --> 1:31:36.480
 for the 20th and 21st century,

1:31:36.480 --> 1:31:37.680
 hard problem of consciousness.

1:31:37.680 --> 1:31:39.960
 And here is why they got it wrong.

1:31:39.960 --> 1:31:41.000
 And so, and if that happened,

1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:42.360
 then I'd really feel like I was part of

1:31:42.360 --> 1:31:44.960
 at least an intellectual process over centuries.

1:31:44.960 --> 1:31:45.960
 And that would be kind of cool.

1:31:45.960 --> 1:31:48.520
 Well, I'm pretty sure they would clone

1:31:48.520 --> 1:31:50.960
 or they would recreate David Chalmers

1:31:50.960 --> 1:31:52.480
 and for the fun of it,

1:31:52.480 --> 1:31:55.160
 sort of bring back other philosophers.

1:31:55.160 --> 1:31:56.200
 Yeah, bring back Descartes.

1:31:56.200 --> 1:31:58.800
 Descartes and just put them in a room and just watch.

1:31:58.800 --> 1:32:02.040
 It'll be a Netflix of the future show

1:32:02.040 --> 1:32:04.600
 where you bring philosophers from different human,

1:32:04.600 --> 1:32:07.680
 100% human philosophers from previous generations,

1:32:07.680 --> 1:32:09.440
 put them in a room and see them.

1:32:09.440 --> 1:32:11.160
 I am totally up for that.

1:32:11.160 --> 1:32:14.040
 Simulators, AGI's of the future,

1:32:14.040 --> 1:32:17.680
 if you're watching this podcast, do that.

1:32:17.680 --> 1:32:20.880
 I would like to be recreated and ending out with Descartes.

1:32:20.880 --> 1:32:22.640
 Where Descartes would be the first,

1:32:22.640 --> 1:32:26.120
 if you could hang out as part of such a TV show

1:32:26.120 --> 1:32:30.880
 with a philosopher that's no longer with us from long ago,

1:32:30.880 --> 1:32:33.200
 who would you choose?

1:32:33.200 --> 1:32:34.760
 Descartes would have to be right up there.

1:32:34.760 --> 1:32:36.840
 Oh, actually a couple of months ago,

1:32:36.840 --> 1:32:39.000
 I got to have a conversation with Descartes,

1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:40.760
 an actor who's actually a philosopher

1:32:40.760 --> 1:32:42.800
 came out on stage playing Descartes.

1:32:42.800 --> 1:32:43.880
 I didn't know this was gonna happen.

1:32:43.880 --> 1:32:46.200
 And I just after I gave a talk

1:32:46.200 --> 1:32:50.120
 and told me about how my ideas were crap

1:32:50.120 --> 1:32:51.560
 and all derived from him.

1:32:51.560 --> 1:32:53.440
 And so we had a long argument.

1:32:53.440 --> 1:32:54.680
 This was great.

1:32:54.680 --> 1:32:57.400
 I would love to see what Descartes would think about AI,

1:32:57.400 --> 1:32:59.520
 for example, and the modern neuroscience.

1:32:59.520 --> 1:33:01.800
 And so I suspect not too much would surprise him,

1:33:01.800 --> 1:33:05.420
 but yeah, William James,

1:33:07.120 --> 1:33:08.720
 for a psychologist of consciousness,

1:33:08.720 --> 1:33:13.720
 I think James was probably the richest.

1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:17.120
 But, oh, there are Immanuel Kant.

1:33:17.120 --> 1:33:19.120
 I never really understood what he was up to

1:33:19.120 --> 1:33:22.760
 if I got to actually talk to him about some of this.

1:33:22.760 --> 1:33:25.720
 Hey, there was Princess Elizabeth who talked with Descartes

1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:28.760
 and who really got at the problems

1:33:28.760 --> 1:33:32.800
 of how Descartes ideas of a nonphysical mind

1:33:32.800 --> 1:33:37.240
 interacting with the physical body couldn't really work.

1:33:37.240 --> 1:33:39.040
 She's been kind of, most philosophers

1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:40.040
 think she's been proved right.

1:33:40.040 --> 1:33:42.560
 So maybe put me in a room with Descartes

1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:45.160
 and Princess Elizabeth and we can all argue it out.

1:33:47.840 --> 1:33:49.360
 What kind of future?

1:33:49.360 --> 1:33:53.280
 So we talked about zombies, a concerning future,

1:33:53.280 --> 1:33:56.180
 but what kind of future excites you?

1:33:56.180 --> 1:33:59.480
 What do you think if we look forward sort of,

1:34:00.480 --> 1:34:02.160
 we're at the very early stages

1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:04.080
 of understanding consciousness.

1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:05.840
 And we're now at the early stages

1:34:05.840 --> 1:34:10.120
 of being able to engineer complex, interesting systems

1:34:10.120 --> 1:34:11.560
 that have degrees of intelligence.

1:34:11.560 --> 1:34:14.240
 And maybe one day we'll have degrees of consciousness,

1:34:14.240 --> 1:34:17.120
 maybe be able to upload brains,

1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:20.000
 all those possibilities, virtual reality.

1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:22.640
 Is there a particular aspect to this future world

1:34:22.640 --> 1:34:24.020
 that just excites you?

1:34:24.880 --> 1:34:26.360
 Well, I think there are lots of different aspects.

1:34:26.360 --> 1:34:29.480
 I mean, frankly, I want it to hurry up and happen.

1:34:29.480 --> 1:34:33.120
 It's like, yeah, we've had some progress lately in AI and VR,

1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:35.960
 but in the grand scheme of things, it's still kind of slow.

1:34:35.960 --> 1:34:38.200
 The changes are not yet transformative.

1:34:38.200 --> 1:34:42.080
 And I'm in my fifties, I've only got so long left.

1:34:42.080 --> 1:34:45.640
 I'd like to see really serious AI in my lifetime

1:34:45.640 --> 1:34:48.240
 and really serious virtual worlds.

1:34:48.240 --> 1:34:49.680
 Cause yeah, once people,

1:34:49.680 --> 1:34:52.040
 I would like to be able to hang out in a virtual reality,

1:34:52.040 --> 1:34:56.520
 which is richer than this reality

1:34:56.520 --> 1:35:00.320
 to really get to inhabit fundamentally different kinds

1:35:00.320 --> 1:35:02.160
 of spaces.

1:35:02.160 --> 1:35:05.000
 Well, I would very much like to be able to upload

1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:07.680
 my mind onto a computer.

1:35:07.680 --> 1:35:10.280
 So maybe I don't have to die.

1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:14.200
 If this is maybe gradually replaced my neurons

1:35:14.200 --> 1:35:17.360
 with a Silicon chips and inhabit a computer.

1:35:17.360 --> 1:35:19.320
 Selfishly, that would be wonderful.

1:35:19.320 --> 1:35:24.320
 I suspect I'm not gonna quite get there in my lifetime,

1:35:24.400 --> 1:35:26.520
 but once that's possible,

1:35:26.520 --> 1:35:28.000
 then you've got the possibility of transforming

1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.200
 your consciousness in remarkable ways,

1:35:30.200 --> 1:35:32.400
 augmenting it, enhancing it.

1:35:33.280 --> 1:35:34.440
 So let me ask then,

1:35:34.440 --> 1:35:38.040
 if such a system is a possibility within your lifetime

1:35:39.560 --> 1:35:42.800
 and you were given the opportunity to become immortal

1:35:44.200 --> 1:35:49.200
 in this kind of way, would you choose to be immortal?

1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:52.400
 Yes, I totally would.

1:35:52.400 --> 1:35:54.880
 I know some people say they couldn't,

1:35:54.880 --> 1:35:59.800
 it'd be awful to be immortal, be so boring or something.

1:35:59.800 --> 1:36:04.800
 I don't see, I really don't see why this might be.

1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:07.200
 I mean, even if it's just ordinary life that continues,

1:36:07.200 --> 1:36:09.520
 ordinary life is not so bad.

1:36:09.520 --> 1:36:12.840
 But furthermore, I kind of suspect that,

1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:16.120
 if the universe is gonna go on forever or indefinitely,

1:36:16.120 --> 1:36:19.240
 it's gonna continue to be interesting.

1:36:19.240 --> 1:36:22.120
 I don't think your view was that we just have to get

1:36:22.120 --> 1:36:24.160
 this one romantic point of interest now

1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:26.160
 and afterwards it's all gonna be boring,

1:36:26.160 --> 1:36:28.440
 super intelligent stasis.

1:36:28.440 --> 1:36:30.000
 I guess my vision is more like,

1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.640
 no, it's gonna continue to be infinitely interesting.

1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:36.120
 Something like as you go up the set theoretic hierarchy,

1:36:36.120 --> 1:36:41.120
 you go from the finite cardinals to Aleph zero

1:36:42.520 --> 1:36:46.000
 and then through there to all the Aleph one and Aleph two

1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:49.840
 and maybe the continuum and you keep taking power sets

1:36:49.840 --> 1:36:51.920
 and in set theory, they've got these results

1:36:51.920 --> 1:36:54.760
 that actually all this is fundamentally unpredictable.

1:36:54.760 --> 1:36:57.360
 It doesn't follow any simple computational patterns.

1:36:57.360 --> 1:36:58.920
 There's new levels of creativity

1:36:58.920 --> 1:37:01.880
 as the set theoretic universe expands and expands.

1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:03.320
 I guess that's my future.

1:37:03.320 --> 1:37:04.840
 That's my vision of the future.

1:37:04.840 --> 1:37:06.000
 That's my optimistic vision

1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:08.040
 of the future of super intelligence.

1:37:08.040 --> 1:37:09.760
 It will keep expanding and keep growing,

1:37:09.760 --> 1:37:12.880
 but still being fundamentally unpredictable at many points.

1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:15.280
 I mean, yes, this creates all kinds of worries

1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:18.960
 like couldn't all be fragile and be destroyed at any point.

1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:21.160
 So we're gonna need a solution to that problem.

1:37:21.160 --> 1:37:23.360
 But if we get to stipulate that I'm immortal,

1:37:23.360 --> 1:37:25.960
 well, I hope that I'm not just immortal and stuck

1:37:25.960 --> 1:37:27.880
 in the single world forever,

1:37:27.880 --> 1:37:30.960
 but I'm immortal and get to take part in this process

1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:34.560
 of going through infinitely rich, created futures.

1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:36.480
 Rich, unpredictable, exciting.

1:37:36.480 --> 1:37:39.880
 Well, I think I speak for a lot of people in saying,

1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:41.840
 I hope you do become immortal and there'll be

1:37:41.840 --> 1:37:43.680
 that Netflix show, The Future,

1:37:43.680 --> 1:37:46.360
 where you get to argue with Descartes,

1:37:47.480 --> 1:37:49.800
 perhaps for all eternity.

1:37:49.800 --> 1:37:51.480

 And now let me leave you with some words

1:38:24.960 --> 1:38:26.960
 from David Chalmers.

1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:30.760
 Materialism is a beautiful and compelling view of the world,

1:38:30.760 --> 1:38:32.240
 but to account for consciousness,

1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:35.240
 we have to go beyond the resources it provides.

1:38:35.240 --> 1:38:54.240
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
