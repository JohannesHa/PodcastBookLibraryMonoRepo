 The following is a conversation with Jed Buchwald, a professor of history and a philosopher of

00:05.840 --> 00:12.000
 science at Caltech, interested especially in the development of scientific concepts

00:12.000 --> 00:18.560
 and the instruments used to create and explore new effects and ideas in science.

 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with Jed Buchwald.

00:31.600 --> 00:38.160
 Does science progress via paradigm shifts and revolutions as philosopher Thomas Kuhn said,

00:38.160 --> 00:40.320
 or does it progress gradually? What do you think?

00:41.280 --> 00:48.240
 Well, I got into this field because I was Tom Kuhn's research assistant 50 years ago, 52 years

00:48.240 --> 00:55.600
 ago. He pulled me into it out of physics instead. So I know his work pretty well. And in the years

00:55.600 --> 01:01.040
 when I was at MIT running an institute, he was then in the philosophy department, used to come

01:01.040 --> 01:08.160
 over all the time to the talks we held and so on. So what would I say about that? He, of course,

01:08.160 --> 01:14.800
 developed his ideas a lot over the years. The thing that he's famous for, the structure of

01:14.800 --> 01:24.720
 scientific revolutions came out in 62. And as you just said, it offered an outline for what he

01:24.720 --> 01:31.280
 called a paradigmatic structure, namely the notion that you have to look at what scientists do as

01:31.280 --> 01:38.800
 forming a community of investigators, and that they're trying to solve various puzzles, as he

01:38.800 --> 01:44.800
 would put it, that crop up, figuring out how this works, how that works and so on. And of course,

01:44.800 --> 01:49.760
 they don't do it out of the blue. They do it within a certain framework. The framework can

01:49.760 --> 01:57.200
 be pretty vague. He called it a paradigm. And his notion was that eventually they run into troubles

01:57.200 --> 02:03.680
 or what he called anomalies. That kind of cracks things. Somebody new comes along with a different

02:03.680 --> 02:11.040
 way of doing it, etc. Do I think things work that way? No, not really. Tom and I used to have

02:11.040 --> 02:20.000
 lengthy discussions about that over the years. I do think there is a common structure that

02:20.000 --> 02:26.240
 formulates both theoretical and experimental practices. And historians nowadays of science

02:26.240 --> 02:33.840
 like to refer to scientific work as what scientists practice. It's almost craftsman like.

02:34.960 --> 02:41.840
 They can usually adapt in various ways. And I can give you all kinds of examples of that.

02:41.840 --> 02:49.200
 I once wrote a book on the origins of wave theory of light. And that is one of the paradigmatic

02:49.200 --> 02:56.960
 examples that Tom used. Only it didn't work that way exactly because he thought that what happened

02:56.960 --> 03:04.720
 was that the wave theory ran into trouble with a certain phenomenon, which it couldn't crack.

03:05.680 --> 03:13.520
 Well, it turned out that in fact, historically that phenomenon was actually not relevant

03:13.520 --> 03:19.760
 later on to the wave theory. And when the wave theory came in, the alternative to it,

03:19.760 --> 03:25.760
 which had prevailed, which was Newton's views light as particles that it seemed couldn't

03:25.760 --> 03:33.200
 explain what the wave theory could explain. Again, not true. Not true. Much more complex

03:33.200 --> 03:40.640
 than that. The wave theory offered the opportunity to deploy novel experimental and mathematical

03:40.640 --> 03:47.520
 structures, which gave younger scientists, mathematicians and others, the opportunity

03:47.520 --> 03:56.480
 to effect, manufacture, make new sorts of devices. It's not that the alternative couldn't sort of

03:56.480 --> 04:04.160
 explain these things, but it never was able to generate them de novo as novelties. In other

04:04.160 --> 04:10.640
 words, if you think of it as something scientists want to progress in the sense of finding new stuff

04:10.640 --> 04:17.200
 to solve, then I think what often happens is that it's not so much that the prevailing view

04:17.200 --> 04:22.480
 can't crack something as that it doesn't give you the opportunity to do new stuff.

04:23.120 --> 04:27.280
 When you say new stuff, are we referring to experimental science here or

04:27.280 --> 04:29.680
 new stuff in the space of new theories?

04:29.680 --> 04:32.800
 Could be both. Could be both actually.

04:32.800 --> 04:36.720
 So how does that... Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on the story of the wave view?

04:36.720 --> 04:43.840
 Sure. The prevailing view of light, at least in France where the wave theory really first took

04:43.840 --> 04:49.040
 off, although it had been introduced in England by Thomas Young, the prevailing theory dates back

04:49.040 --> 04:55.520
 to Newton that light is a stream of particles and that refraction and reflection involve sort

04:55.520 --> 05:03.680
 of repulsive and attractive forces that deflect and bend the paths of these particles. Newton was

05:03.680 --> 05:10.560
 not able successfully to deal with the phenomenon of what happens when light goes past a knife's

05:10.560 --> 05:19.120
 edge or a sharp edge, what we now call diffraction. He had cooked up something about it that no

05:19.120 --> 05:26.080
 mathematical structure could be applied. Thomas Young first, but really this guy named Augustin

05:26.080 --> 05:35.840
 Fresnel in France deployed, in Fresnel's case, rather advanced calculus forms of mathematics,

05:35.840 --> 05:41.840
 which enabled computations to be done and observations to be melded with these

05:41.840 --> 05:49.120
 computations in a way that you could not do or see how to do with Newton. Did that mean that the

05:49.120 --> 05:56.560
 Newtonian explanation of what goes on in diffraction fails? Not really. You can actually

05:58.000 --> 06:05.280
 make it work, but you can't generate anything new out of it. Whereas using the mathematics

06:05.280 --> 06:12.560
 of wave optics in respect to a particular phenomenon called polarization, which ironically

06:12.560 --> 06:18.960
 was discovered by partisans of Newton's way of doing things, you were able to generate devices

06:20.240 --> 06:29.120
 which reflect light in crystals, do various things that the Newtonian way could accommodate only

06:29.120 --> 06:36.480
 after the fact. They couldn't generate it from the beginning. And so if you want to be somebody who

06:36.480 --> 06:44.720
 is working a novel vein, which increasingly becomes the case with people who become what we

06:44.720 --> 06:51.120
 now call physicists in the 1820s, 30s, and 40s in particular, then that's the direction you're going

06:51.120 --> 06:57.360
 to go. But there were holdouts until the 1850s. I want to try to elaborate on the nature of the

06:57.360 --> 07:02.800
 disagreement you have with Thomas Kuhn. So do you still believe in paradigm shifts? Do you still see

07:02.800 --> 07:09.680
 that there's ideas that really have a transformational effect on science? The nature of

07:09.680 --> 07:16.880
 the disagreement has to do with how those paradigm shifts come to be? How they come to be and how

07:16.880 --> 07:25.280
 they change. I certainly think they exist. How strong they may be at any given time is maybe not

07:25.280 --> 07:31.200
 quite as powerful as Tom thought in general. Although towards the end of his life, he was

07:31.200 --> 07:38.720
 beginning to develop different modifications of his original way of thinking. But I don't think

07:38.720 --> 07:47.840
 that the changes happened quite so neatly, if you will, in reaction to novel experimental

07:47.840 --> 07:56.880
 observations. They get much more complex than that. In terms of neatness, how much of science

07:56.880 --> 08:05.360
 progresses by individual lone geniuses and how much by the messy collaboration of competing and

08:05.360 --> 08:18.400
 cooperating humans? I don't think you can cut that with a knife to say it's this percent and

08:18.400 --> 08:27.680
 that percent. It's almost always the case that there are one or two or maybe three individuals

08:27.680 --> 08:37.840
 who are sort of central to what goes on when things begin to shift. Are they inevitably and

08:37.840 --> 08:48.080
 solely responsible for what then begins to happen in a major way? I think not. It depends. You can

08:48.080 --> 08:59.200
 go very far back with this, even into antiquity to see what goes on. The major locus we always

08:59.200 --> 09:04.320
 talk about from the beginning is if you're talking about Galileo's work on motion, for example,

09:05.680 --> 09:11.760
 were there ways of accommodating it that others could adapt to without buying into the whole

09:11.760 --> 09:19.600
 scheme? Yes. Did it eventually evolve and start convincing people because you could also do

09:19.600 --> 09:26.160
 other things with it that you couldn't otherwise do? Also, yes. Let me give you an example.

09:26.160 --> 09:32.720
 The great French mathematician philosopher Descartes, who was a mechanical philosopher,

09:32.720 --> 09:38.880
 he believed the world was matter in motion. He never thought much of what Galileo had done

09:38.880 --> 09:44.000
 in respect to motion because he thought, well, at best, it's some sort of approximative scheme

09:44.000 --> 09:51.600
 or something like that. But one of his initial, I wouldn't call him a disciple, but follower,

09:51.600 --> 09:56.960
 who then broke with him in a number of ways, was a man named Christian Huygens, who was,

09:56.960 --> 10:02.640
 along with Newton, one of the two greatest scientists of the 17th century. Huygens is

10:02.640 --> 10:10.880
 older than Newton, and Huygens nicely deployed Galilean relationships in respect to motion

10:11.440 --> 10:17.200
 to develop all sorts of things, including the first pendulum governed clock,

10:19.280 --> 10:24.720
 and even figured out how to build one, which keeps perfect time, except it didn't work. But

10:24.720 --> 10:28.400
 he had the mathematical structure for it. How well known is Huygens?

10:28.400 --> 10:31.040
 Oh, very well known. Should I know him well?

10:31.040 --> 10:33.280
 Yes, you should. Interesting.

10:33.280 --> 10:34.560
 You should definitely know him.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.760
 No, no, no, no, no. Can we define should here?

10:37.760 --> 10:38.240
 Okay.

10:38.240 --> 10:38.960
 Because I don't.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.100
 Right.

10:40.880 --> 10:46.880
 So is this should like, yeah, can you define should?

10:48.640 --> 10:55.360
 Should means this. If you had taken up to a second year physics courses, you should,

10:55.360 --> 11:00.640
 you would have heard his name because one of the fundamental principles in optics is called

11:00.640 --> 11:01.760
 Huygens principle.

11:03.280 --> 11:03.680
 Okay.

11:03.680 --> 11:04.320
 Okay.

11:04.320 --> 11:07.040
 Yeah, so I have and I have heard his name.

11:07.040 --> 11:07.920
 There you go.

11:07.920 --> 11:08.800
 No, but I don't remember.

11:08.800 --> 11:09.760
 But you don't remember.

11:09.760 --> 11:16.640
 So I mean, there's a very different thing between names attached to principles and laws and so on

11:16.640 --> 11:21.520
 that you sometimes let go of, you just remember the equations of the principles themselves,

11:21.520 --> 11:25.760
 and the personalities of science. And there's certain personalities,

11:25.760 --> 11:32.880
 certain human beings that stand out. And that's why there's a sense to which the lone inventor,

11:32.880 --> 11:38.880
 the lone scientist is the way I personally mean, I think a lot of people think about the history

11:38.880 --> 11:45.760
 of science is these lone geniuses. Without them, the senses, if you remove Newton from the picture,

11:45.760 --> 11:51.520
 if you remove Galileo from the picture, then science would, there's almost a feeling like

11:51.520 --> 11:57.360
 it would just have stopped there. Or at the very least, there's a feeling like it would take much

11:57.360 --> 12:01.840
 longer to develop the things that were developed. Is that a silly way to look at the history?

12:01.840 --> 12:12.800
 That's not entirely incorrect, I suppose. I find it difficult to believe that had Galileo not

12:12.800 --> 12:19.680
 existed, that eventually someone like Huygens, for instance, given the context of the time,

12:19.680 --> 12:27.440
 what was floating around in the belief structure concerning the nature of the world and so on,

12:27.440 --> 12:34.560
 the developments in mathematics and whatnot, that sooner or later, whether it would have been

12:34.560 --> 12:41.120
 exactly the same or not, I cannot say. But would things have evolved? Yes.

12:41.120 --> 12:54.080
 If we look at the long arc of history of science, from back when we were in the caves trying to knock

12:54.080 --> 13:03.040
 two rocks together, or maybe make a basic tool to a long time from now, many centuries from now,

13:03.040 --> 13:09.680
 when human civilization finally destroys itself. If we look at that history, and imagine you're

13:09.680 --> 13:16.800
 a historian at the end, like with the fire of the apocalypse coming upon us, and you look back at

13:16.800 --> 13:26.000
 this time in the 21st century, how far along are we on that arc? Do you sense? Have we invented

13:26.000 --> 13:33.440
 and discovered everything that's to be discovered, or are we at like below 1%? You're going to get a

13:33.440 --> 13:39.920
 lot of absurd questions today. I apologize. It's a lugubrious picture you're painting there.

13:39.920 --> 13:44.560
 I don't even know what the word lugubrious means, but I love it. Lugubrious.

13:44.560 --> 13:51.200
 Well, let me try and separate the question of whether we're all going to die in an apocalypse

13:51.200 --> 13:57.680
 in several hundred years or not from the question of where science may be sitting.

13:57.680 --> 14:06.160
 Take that as an assumption. Okay. I find that hard to say. And I find it hard to say

14:07.760 --> 14:17.280
 because in the deepest sense of the term, as it's usually deployed by philosophers of science today,

14:17.280 --> 14:29.520
 I'm not fundamentally a realist. That is to say, I think our access to the inner workings of nature

14:30.080 --> 14:40.400
 is inevitably mediated by what we can do with the materials and factors around us. We can probe

14:40.400 --> 14:47.200
 things in various ways. Does that mean that I don't think that the standard model in quantum

14:47.200 --> 14:52.400
 electrodynamics is incorrect? Of course not. I wouldn't even dream of saying such a thing.

14:52.400 --> 14:59.040
 It can do a lot, especially when it comes to figuring out what's happening in very large,

14:59.040 --> 15:07.280
 expensive particle accelerators and applying results in cosmology and so on as well.

15:09.280 --> 15:16.880
 Do I think that we have inevitably probed the depths of reality through this? I do not agree

15:16.880 --> 15:23.920
 with Steven Weinberg who thinks we have about such things. Do I, on the other hand, think that

15:24.720 --> 15:30.640
 the way in which science has been moving for the last hundred years, physics in particular is what

15:30.640 --> 15:38.160
 I have in mind, will continue on the same course? In that sense, I don't because we're not going to

15:38.160 --> 15:44.560
 be building bigger and bigger and more and more expensive machines to rip apart particles in

15:44.560 --> 15:50.640
 various ways. In which case, what are physicists going to do? They'll turn their attention to other

15:50.640 --> 15:57.360
 aspects. There are all sorts of things we've never explained about the material world.

15:57.360 --> 16:02.160
 We don't have theories that go beyond a certain point for all sorts of things.

16:04.240 --> 16:09.600
 Can we, for example, start with the standard model and work our way up all the way to chemical

16:09.600 --> 16:17.200
 transformations? You can make an argument about it and you can justify things, but in chemistry,

16:17.200 --> 16:22.560
 that's not the way people work. They work with much higher level quantum mechanical relationships

16:22.560 --> 16:33.200
 and so on. This notion of the deep theory to explain everything is a longstanding belief

16:33.200 --> 16:39.760
 which goes back pretty far, although I think it only takes its fullest form

16:41.440 --> 16:47.600
 sometime towards the end of the 19th century. Maybe we just speak to that. You're referring to

16:48.640 --> 16:54.400
 a hope, a dream, a reality of coming up with a theory of everything that explains everything.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.720
 There's a very specific thing that that currently means in physics,

16:58.720 --> 17:06.000
 is the unification of the laws of physics. But I'm sure in antiquity or before it meant maybe

17:06.000 --> 17:11.120
 something else, or is it always about physics? Because I mean, I think as you've kind of implied

17:13.520 --> 17:17.200
 in physics, there's a sense once you get to the theory of everything, you've understood everything,

17:17.760 --> 17:21.360
 but there's a very deep sense in which you've actually understood not very much at all.

17:21.920 --> 17:26.880
 You've understood at that particular level how things work, but you don't understand how the

17:26.880 --> 17:31.280
 abstractions on top of abstractions form, all the way to the chemistry, to the human mind,

17:31.280 --> 17:37.440
 and the human societies, and all those kinds of things. So maybe you can speak to the theory of

17:37.440 --> 17:42.480
 everything and its history and comment on what the heck does that even mean, the theory of everything.

17:43.040 --> 17:48.800
 Well, I don't think you can go back that far with something like that. Maybe to the, at best,

17:48.800 --> 17:53.840
 to the 17th century. If you go back all the way in antiquity, there are, of course,

17:53.840 --> 18:07.040
 discussions about the nature of the world. But first of all, you have to recognize that the

18:07.040 --> 18:17.680
 manipulative character of physics and chemistry, the probing of... Let me put it this way. We assume

18:17.680 --> 18:26.400
 and have assumed for a long time, I'll come back to when in a moment, that if I take a little device,

18:26.400 --> 18:33.360
 which is really complicatedly made out of all kinds of things, and I put a piece of some material in

18:33.360 --> 18:39.760
 it, and I monkey around with it and do all kinds of unnatural things to it, things that wouldn't

18:39.760 --> 18:46.880
 happen naturally, and I find out how it behaves and whatnot, and then I try and make an argument

18:46.880 --> 18:54.240
 about how that really applies even in the natural world without any artificial structures and so on.

18:54.240 --> 19:01.840
 That's not a belief that was widely held by pretty much anyone until sometime maybe

19:01.840 --> 19:08.080
 in the 1500s. And when it was first held, it was held by people we now call alchemists.

19:08.880 --> 19:13.360
 So alchemy was the first, the early days of the theory of everything, of a dream of a theory of

19:13.360 --> 19:20.720
 everything. I would put it a little differently. I think it's more along the way, a dream that

19:20.720 --> 19:30.080
 by probing nature in artificially constructed ways, we can find out what's going on deep down there.

19:32.640 --> 19:39.200
 So that's distinct from science being an observing thing, where you observe nature

19:39.200 --> 19:44.720
 and you study nature. You're talking about probing, like messing with nature to understand it.

19:45.520 --> 19:52.000
 Indeed I am. But that, of course, is the very essence of experimental science. You have to

19:54.000 --> 20:03.120
 manipulate nature to find out things about it, and then you have to convince others that you haven't

20:03.120 --> 20:10.880
 so manipulated it that what you've done is to produce what amounts to fake artifactual behavior

20:10.880 --> 20:18.160
 that doesn't really hold purely naturally. So where are we today in your sense to jump

20:18.160 --> 20:26.160
 around a little bit with the theory of everything? Maybe a quick kind of sense you have about the

20:26.160 --> 20:30.320
 journey in the world of physics that we're taking towards the theory of everything.

20:30.320 --> 20:36.560
 Well, I'm, of course, not a practicing physicist. I mean, I was trained in physics at Princeton

20:36.560 --> 20:39.600
 a long time ago. Until Thomas Kuhn stole you away.

20:40.400 --> 20:45.200
 More or less. I was taking graduate courses in those days in general relativity. I was an

20:45.200 --> 20:49.120
 undergraduate, but I moved up and then I took a course with him and...

20:49.840 --> 20:56.240
 Well, you made the mistake of being compelled by charismatic philosophers and never looked back.

20:56.240 --> 21:06.080
 I suppose so in a way. From what I understand, talking especially to my friends at Caltech,

21:08.080 --> 21:17.040
 like Kip Thorne and others, the fundamental notion is that actually the laws that even

21:17.040 --> 21:26.560
 at the deepest level we can sort of divine and work with in the universe that we inhabit are

21:26.560 --> 21:32.880
 perhaps quite unique to this particular universe as it formed at the Big Bang.

21:34.560 --> 21:43.200
 The question is, how deep does it go? If you are very mathematically inclined, the prevailing notion

21:43.200 --> 21:52.640
 for several decades now has been what's called string theory, but that has not been able to

21:53.360 --> 22:00.400
 figure a way to generate probative experimental evidence, although it's pretty good apparently

22:00.400 --> 22:08.400
 at accommodating things. Then the question is, what's before the Big Bang? Actually,

22:08.400 --> 22:17.280
 the word before doesn't mean anything given the nature of time, but why do we have the

22:17.280 --> 22:24.720
 laws that prevail in our universe? Well, there is a notion that those laws prevail in our universe

22:26.240 --> 22:28.560
 because if they didn't, we wouldn't be here.

22:30.560 --> 22:35.600
 That's a bit of a cyclical, but nevertheless, a compelling definition. And there's all kinds

22:35.600 --> 22:42.000
 of things like it seems like the unification of those laws could be discovered by looking

22:42.000 --> 22:45.920
 inside of a black hole because you get both the general relativity and the quantum mechanics,

22:45.920 --> 22:51.920
 quantum field theory in there. Experimentally, of course, there's a lot of interesting ideas.

22:51.920 --> 22:57.920
 We can't really look close to the Big Bang. We can't look that far back. Caltech and MIT will

22:57.920 --> 23:03.120
 LIGO looking at gravitational waves, perhaps allows us to march backwards and so on. Yeah,

23:03.120 --> 23:07.200
 it's really exciting space. And there's, of course, the theory of everything,

23:07.920 --> 23:13.200
 like with a lot of things in science, captivates the dreams of those who are perhaps completely

23:13.200 --> 23:20.160
 outside of science. It's the dream of discovering the key to the nature of how everything works.

23:21.360 --> 23:31.120
 And that feels deeply human. That's perhaps the basic elements of what makes up a scientist in

23:31.120 --> 23:39.600
 the end is that curiosity, that longing to understand. Let me ask, you mentioned a disagreement

23:39.600 --> 23:48.320
 with Weinberg on reality. Could you elaborate a little bit? Well, obviously, I don't disagree

23:48.320 --> 23:55.280
 with Steve Weinberg on physics itself. I wouldn't know enough to even begin to do that. And clearly,

23:55.280 --> 24:02.000
 you know, he's one of the founders of the standard model and so on. And it works to a level of

24:02.000 --> 24:09.920
 accuracy that no physical theory has ever worked at before. I suppose the question in my mind is

24:10.720 --> 24:18.000
 something that in one way could go back to the philosopher Immanuel Kant in the 18th century,

24:18.000 --> 24:29.600
 namely, can we really ever convince ourselves that we have come to grips with something that is

24:30.320 --> 24:41.680
 not in itself knowable to us by our senses, or even except in the most remote way through the

24:41.680 --> 24:48.320
 complex instruments that we make as to what it is that underlies everything? Can we corral it

24:48.960 --> 24:57.760
 with mathematics and experimental structures? Yes. Do I think that a particular way of corraling

24:57.760 --> 25:06.240
 nature will inevitably play itself out? I don't know. It always has. I'll put it to you that way.

25:06.240 --> 25:18.320
 So the basic question is, can we know reality? Is that the Kant question? Is that the Weinberg

25:18.320 --> 25:28.960
 question? We humans, with our brains, can we comprehend reality? Sounds like a very trippy

25:28.960 --> 25:34.480
 question because a lot of it rests on definitions of know and comprehend and reality. But

25:34.480 --> 25:44.080
 get to the bottom of it. It's turtles on top of turtles. Can we get to the bottom turtle and say

25:44.080 --> 25:56.240
 hello? Well, maybe I can put it to you this way in a way that I often begin discussions in a class

25:56.240 --> 26:07.120
 on the history of science and so on, and say, I'm looking at you. Yes. You are in fact a figment of

26:07.120 --> 26:15.040
 my imagination. You have a messed up imagination, yes. Well, what do I mean by that? If I were a

26:15.040 --> 26:28.400
 dragonfly looking at you, whatever my nervous system would form by way of a perceptual structure

26:29.120 --> 26:39.040
 would clearly be utterly different from what my brain and perceptual system altogether is forming

26:39.040 --> 26:48.160
 when I look at you. Who's right? Is it me or the dragonfly?

26:51.680 --> 26:57.600
 Well, the dragonfly is certainly very impressive, so I don't know. But yes, the observer matters.

27:02.400 --> 27:06.240
 What is that supposed to tell us about objective reality?

27:06.240 --> 27:16.080
 Well, I think it means that it's very difficult to get beyond the constructs that our perceptual

27:16.080 --> 27:24.400
 system is leading us to. When we make apparatus and devices and so on, we're still making things,

27:25.120 --> 27:30.640
 the results of which or the outputs of which we process perceptually in various ways.

27:30.640 --> 27:36.560
 An analogy I like to use with students sometimes is this. All right, they all have their laptops

27:36.560 --> 27:45.760
 open in front of them, of course. I've sent them something to read, and I say, okay, click on it

27:45.760 --> 27:51.920
 and open it up. PDF opens up. I said, what are you looking at? They said, well, I'm looking at the

27:51.920 --> 27:57.520
 paper that you sent me. I said, no, you're not. What you're looking at is what you're looking at

27:57.520 --> 28:06.000
 is a stream of light coming off LEDs or LCDs coming off a screen. And I said, what happens when you

28:06.000 --> 28:12.320
 use your mouse and move that fake piece of paper on the screen around? What are you doing? You're

28:12.320 --> 28:18.080
 not moving a piece of paper around, are you? You're moving a construct around, a construct

28:18.080 --> 28:24.080
 that's being processed so that our perceptual system can interact with it in the way we

28:24.080 --> 28:34.800
 interact with pieces of paper. Yes. But it's not real. So, are there things outside of the reach

28:34.800 --> 28:43.120
 of science? Can you maybe, as an example, talk about consciousness? I'm asking for a friend

28:43.120 --> 28:52.640
 trying to figure this thing out. Well, boy, I mean, I read a fair bit of science, but I don't

28:52.640 --> 28:58.240
 know. I read a fair bit about that, but I certainly can't really say much about it.

29:02.880 --> 29:08.640
 I'm a materialist in the deepest sense of the term. I don't think there is anything out there

29:09.280 --> 29:16.480
 except material structures which interact in various ways. Do I think, for example,

29:16.480 --> 29:23.920
 that this bottle of water is conscious? No, I do not. Although, how would I know? I can't talk to

29:23.920 --> 29:29.760
 it. Yeah. But, so what do... It's a hypothesis you have. It's an opinion, an educated opinion

29:29.760 --> 29:35.200
 that may be very wrong. Well, I know that you're conscious because I can interact directly with you.

29:35.200 --> 29:41.040
 But am I? Well, unless you're a figment of my imagination, of course. Or I'm a robot that's

29:41.040 --> 29:48.640
 able to generate the illusion of consciousness effectively enough to facilitate a good

29:48.640 --> 29:52.560
 conversation. Because we humans do want to pretend that we're talking to other conscious beings.

29:52.560 --> 29:56.880
 That's how we respect them. If it's not conscious, we don't respect them. We're not good at talking

29:56.880 --> 30:01.280
 to robots. That's true. Of course, we generalize from our own inner sense, which is the kind of

30:01.280 --> 30:07.120
 thing Descartes said from the beginning. We generalize from that. But I do think that

30:07.120 --> 30:14.240
 consciousness must be something, whatever it is, that occurs as a result of some particular

30:14.240 --> 30:24.400
 organizational structure of material elements. Does materialism mean that it's all within the

30:24.400 --> 30:35.680
 reach of science? My sense would be that, especially as neuroscience progresses more and more and

30:35.680 --> 30:44.320
 at Caltech, we just built a whole neuroscience arena and so on. And as more knowledge is gained

30:44.320 --> 30:52.800
 about the ways in which animals, when they behave, what patterns show up at various parts of the

30:52.800 --> 31:00.480
 brain and nervous system, and perhaps extending it to humans eventually as well, we'll get more of a

31:00.480 --> 31:12.880
 we'll get more of a handle on what brain activity is associated with experiences that we have as

31:12.880 --> 31:20.560
 humans. Can we move from the brain activity to the experiences in terms of our perception? No,

31:20.560 --> 31:26.560
 you can't. Perception is perception. That's the hypothesis, once again.

31:26.560 --> 31:35.760
 Maybe consciousness is just one of the laws of physics that's yet to be discovered. Maybe it

31:35.760 --> 31:44.800
 permeates all matter. Maybe it's as simple as trying to plug it in and plug into the ability

31:44.800 --> 31:52.000
 to generate and control that kind of law of physics that would crack open. Or we would understand

31:52.000 --> 31:56.880
 that the bottle of water is in fact conscious, just much less conscious than us humans,

31:56.880 --> 32:00.960
 and then we would be able to generate beings that are more conscious.

32:02.080 --> 32:06.400
 Well, that'll be unfortunate. I'd have to stop drinking the water after that.

32:06.400 --> 32:11.360
 Every time you take a sip, there's a little bit of suffering going on.

32:11.360 --> 32:11.600
 Right.

32:12.320 --> 32:18.080
 What do you use the most interesting, beautiful moments in the history of science? What stands

32:18.080 --> 32:22.160
 out? And then we can pull at that thread.

32:22.160 --> 32:32.960
 Right. Well, I like to think of events that have a major impact and involve both beautiful,

32:34.560 --> 32:41.440
 conceptual, mathematical, if we're talking physical structures work, and are associated as

32:41.440 --> 32:50.960
 well with probing experimental situations. So among my favorites is one of the most famous,

32:51.520 --> 32:59.040
 which was the young Isaac Newton's work with the colors produced when you pass sunlight through a

32:59.040 --> 33:08.720
 prism. And why do I like that? It's not profoundly mathematical in one sense. It doesn't need it

33:08.720 --> 33:14.320
 initially. It needs the following though, which begins to show you I think a little bit about what

33:14.320 --> 33:19.440
 gets involved when you've got a smart individual who's trying to monkey around with stuff and

33:19.440 --> 33:26.560
 finds new things about it. First, let me say that the prevailing notion going back to antiquity

33:26.560 --> 33:34.720
 was that colors are produced in a sense by modifying or tinting white light, that they're

33:34.720 --> 33:41.200
 modifications of white light. In other words, the colors are not in the sunlight in any way.

33:43.520 --> 33:49.680
 Now, what Newton did following experiments done by Descartes before him who came to very different

33:49.680 --> 33:59.680
 conclusions, he took a prism. You might ask, where do you get prisms in the 1660s? County fairs,

33:59.680 --> 34:03.840
 they were very popular. They were pretty crude with bubbles in them and everything,

34:03.840 --> 34:08.000
 but they produced colors. So you could buy them at county fairs and things very popular.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.360
 Oh, so they were modifying the white light to create colors.

34:11.360 --> 34:18.400
 Well, they were creating colors from it, well known. And what he did was the following. He

34:18.400 --> 34:25.680
 was by this time, even though he's very young, a very good mathematician. And he could use the

34:26.320 --> 34:32.320
 then known laws for how light behaves when it goes through glass to calculate what should happen

34:32.320 --> 34:39.120
 if you took light from the sun, passed it from a hole, through a little hole, then hit the prism,

34:39.600 --> 34:45.040
 goes out of the prism, strikes a wall a long distance away and makes a splash of light,

34:45.040 --> 34:49.680
 never mind the colors for a moment, makes a splash of light there. He was very smart.

34:50.400 --> 34:56.080
 First of all, he abstracts from the colors themselves, even though that's what everybody's

34:56.080 --> 35:01.760
 paying attention to initially. Because what he knows is this, he knows that if you take

35:01.760 --> 35:09.760
 this prism and you turn it to a certain particular angle, that he knew what it should be because he

35:09.760 --> 35:16.320
 could calculate things. Very few other people in Europe at the time could calculate things like he

35:16.320 --> 35:23.280
 could. That if you turn the prism to that particular angle, then the sun, which is, of course, a

35:23.280 --> 35:30.160
 circle, when its light passes through this little hole and then into the prism on the far distant

35:30.160 --> 35:43.520
 wall, should still make a circle. But it doesn't. It makes a very long image. And this led him to a

35:43.520 --> 35:48.800
 very different conception of light, indicating that there are different types of light in the

35:48.800 --> 35:54.640
 sunlight. Now, to go beyond that, what's particularly interesting, I think, is the following.

35:54.640 --> 36:02.320
 When he published this paper, which got him into a controversy, he really didn't describe

36:02.320 --> 36:08.000
 at all what he did. He just gave you some numbers. Now, I just told you that you had to set this

36:08.000 --> 36:14.880
 prism at a certain angle, right? You would think, because we do have his notes and so on,

36:16.320 --> 36:22.080
 you would think that he took some kind of complicated measuring device to set the prism.

36:22.080 --> 36:30.320
 He didn't. He held it in his hand. That's all. And he twiddled it around. And what was he doing?

36:30.320 --> 36:36.960
 It turns out that when you twiddle the prism around at the point where you should get a circle

36:36.960 --> 36:43.840
 from a circle, it also is the place where the image does not move very fast. So if you want

36:43.840 --> 36:52.880
 to get close to there, you just twiddle it. This is manipulative experimentation taking advantage

36:52.880 --> 37:00.800
 through his mathematical knowledge of the inherent inaccuracies that let you come to

37:00.800 --> 37:09.040
 exact conclusions, regardless of the built in problematics of measurement. He's the only one

37:09.040 --> 37:15.840
 I know of doing anything like that at the time. Yeah. Well, even still, there's very few people

37:15.840 --> 37:23.040
 that are able to have to calculate as well as he did to be a theoretician and an experimentalist,

37:23.600 --> 37:35.360
 like in the same moment. It's true, although until really well into the 20th century,

37:35.360 --> 37:44.400
 maybe the beginning of the 20th century, really, most of the most significant experimental results

37:45.040 --> 37:52.480
 produced in the 1800s, which laid the foundations for light, electricity, electrodynamics, and so on,

37:53.520 --> 38:02.960
 even hydrodynamics and whatnot, were also produced by people who are both excellent calculators,

38:02.960 --> 38:09.280
 very talented mathematicians, and good with their hands experimentally.

38:11.360 --> 38:18.640
 And then that led to the 21st century with Enrico Fermi that one of the last people that

38:18.640 --> 38:25.200
 was able to do that, both of those things very well, and that he built a little device

38:25.200 --> 38:28.960
 called an atomic bomb that has some positives and negatives.

38:28.960 --> 38:34.640
 Well, right. Of course, that actually did involve some pretty large scale elaborate

38:34.640 --> 38:38.800
 equipment too. Well, holding a prism in your hands.

38:38.800 --> 38:44.480
 Right. No. What's the controversy that Newton got into with that paper when he published it?

38:45.840 --> 38:54.560
 Well, in a number of ways, it's a complicated story. There was a very talented character

38:54.560 --> 39:00.240
 known as a mechanic. Mechanic means somebody who was a craftsman who could build and make

39:00.240 --> 39:05.920
 really good stuff. And he was very talented. His name was Robert Hooke. And he was the guy who

39:06.480 --> 39:11.280
 at the weekly meetings of the Royal Society in London, and Newton's not in London, he's at

39:11.280 --> 39:18.160
 Cambridge, he's a young guy, he would demonstrate new things. And he was very clever. And he had

39:18.160 --> 39:26.480
 written a book, in fact, called the Micrographia, which by the way, he used a microscope to make

39:26.480 --> 39:31.920
 the first depictions of things like a fly's eye, the structure of, you know, it had a big influence.

39:31.920 --> 39:36.880
 And in there, he also talked about light. And so he had a different view of light. And when he read

39:36.880 --> 39:44.480
 what Newton wrote, he had a double reaction. On the one hand, he said, anything in there that is

39:44.480 --> 39:51.680
 correct, I already knew. And anything that I didn't already know, is probably not right anyway.

39:51.680 --> 39:58.320
 Trey Lockerbie I gotta love egos. Okay. Can we just step

39:58.320 --> 40:05.200
 back? Can you say who was Isaac Newton? What are the things he contributed to this world

40:05.200 --> 40:17.840
 in the space of ideas? Wow. Who was he? He was born in 1642,

40:20.000 --> 40:25.360
 and near the small town of Grantham in England. In fact, the house he was born in,

40:26.080 --> 40:29.280
 and that his mother died in is still there and can be visited.

40:29.280 --> 40:41.760
 His father died before he was born. And his mother eventually remarried a man named

40:41.760 --> 40:52.160
 Reverend Smith, whom Newton did not like at all. Because Reverend Smith took his mother away to

40:52.160 --> 40:57.200
 live with him a few miles away, leaving Newton to be brought up more or less by his grandmother

40:57.200 --> 41:01.920
 over there. And he had huge resentment about that his whole life.

41:02.880 --> 41:08.320
 I think that gives you a little inkling that a little bit of trauma in childhood,

41:08.320 --> 41:13.200
 maybe a complicated father son relationship can be useful to create a good scientist.

41:13.920 --> 41:19.120
 Could be, although this case, it would be right, the absent father, non father relationship,

41:19.120 --> 41:26.240
 so to speak. He was known as a kid, little that we do know for being very clever about

41:26.240 --> 41:34.640
 flying kites. And there are stories about him putting candles and putting flying kites and

41:34.640 --> 41:39.120
 scaring the living devil out of people at night by doing that and things like that,

41:39.120 --> 41:47.120
 making things. Most of the physicists and natural philosophers I've dealt with actually,

41:48.080 --> 41:54.400
 as children, were very fond of making and playing with things. I can't think of one I know of who

41:54.400 --> 42:06.640
 wasn't actually, very good with their hands and whatnot. His mother wanted him to take over the

42:06.640 --> 42:11.520
 manor. It was a kind of farming manor. They were the class of what are known as yeomans.

42:12.160 --> 42:17.600
 There are stories that he wasn't very good at that. One day, one of the stories is he's sitting

42:17.600 --> 42:24.480
 out in the field and the cows come home without him and he doesn't know what's going on. Anyway,

42:24.480 --> 42:30.960
 had relatives and he manages to get to Cambridge, sent to Cambridge because he's known to be smart.

42:30.960 --> 42:37.600
 He's read books that he got from local dignitaries and some relatives. And he goes there as what's

42:37.600 --> 42:43.200
 known as a sub sizer. What does that mean? Well, it's not too pleasant. Basically, a sub sizer

42:43.200 --> 42:50.960
 was a student who had to clean the bed pans of the richer kids. That didn't last too long.

42:50.960 --> 43:00.240
 He makes his way and he becomes absorbed in some of the new ways of thinking that are being talked

43:00.240 --> 43:06.560
 about on the parts of Descartes and others as well. There's also the traditional curriculum,

43:06.560 --> 43:12.400
 which he follows. And we have his notes. We have his student notebooks and so on. We can see

43:12.400 --> 43:20.240
 gradually this young man's mind focusing and coming to grips with deeper questions of the

43:20.240 --> 43:27.440
 nature of the world and perception even, and how we know things and also probing and learning

43:28.640 --> 43:35.760
 mathematical structures to such an extent that he builds on some of the investigations that had been

43:35.760 --> 43:43.200
 done in the period before him to create the foundations of a way of investigating processes

43:43.200 --> 43:50.000
 that happen and change continuously instead of by leaps and bounds and so on, forming the

43:50.000 --> 43:56.160
 foundation of what we now call the calculus. Yeah. So can you maybe just paint a little bit

43:56.160 --> 44:04.000
 of a picture you've already started of what were the things that bothered him the most

44:04.000 --> 44:11.280
 that stood out to him the most about the traditional curriculum, about the way people

44:11.280 --> 44:16.080
 saw the world? You mentioned discrete versus continuous. Is there something where he began

44:16.080 --> 44:21.200
 thinking in a revolutionary way? Because it's fascinating. Most of us go to college,

44:22.560 --> 44:30.560
 Cambridge or otherwise, and we just kind of take what we hear as gospel, right? Like not gospel,

44:30.560 --> 44:39.440
 but as like facts. You don't begin to sort of see how can I expand on this aggressively or how can

44:39.440 --> 44:46.960
 I challenge everything that I hear rigorously, mathematically through the... I mean, I don't even

44:46.960 --> 44:52.480
 know how rigorous the mathematics was at that point. I'm sure it was geometry and so on,

44:52.480 --> 45:00.160
 no calculus, huh? There are elements of what turned into the calculus that predate Newton,

45:00.160 --> 45:06.560
 but... How much rigor was there? How much... Well, rigor, no. And then, of course, no scientific

45:06.560 --> 45:15.120
 method. Not really. I mean, somewhat. I mean, appreciation of data. That is a separate question

45:15.120 --> 45:20.960
 from a question of method. Appreciation of data is a significant question as to what you do with

45:20.960 --> 45:26.320
 data. There's lots of things you're asking. I apologize. So maybe let's backtrack in the first

45:26.320 --> 45:32.640
 question. Was there something that was bothering him that he especially thought he could contribute

45:32.640 --> 45:38.480
 or work on? Well, of course, we can't go back and talk to him, but we do have these student

45:38.480 --> 45:43.920
 notebooks. There's two of them. One's called The Philosophical Questions and the other is called

45:43.920 --> 45:49.840
 The Waste Book. The Philosophical Questions has discussions of the nature of reality and

45:49.840 --> 45:55.760
 various issues concerning it. And The Waste Book has things that have to do with motion in various

45:55.760 --> 46:01.760
 ways, what happens in collisions and things of that sort. And it's a complicated story,

46:01.760 --> 46:07.760
 but what's among the things that I think are interesting is he took notes in The Philosophical

46:07.760 --> 46:17.120
 Questions on stuff that was traditionally given to you in the curriculums going back several hundred

46:17.120 --> 46:25.840
 years, namely on what scholars refer to as scholastic or neo scholastic ways of thinking

46:25.840 --> 46:32.800
 about the world dating back to the reformulation of Aristotle in the Middle Ages by Thomas Aquinas

46:32.800 --> 46:37.840
 in the church. This is a totally different way of thinking about things, which actually connects to

46:37.840 --> 46:45.760
 something we were saying a moment ago. For instance, so I'm wearing a blue shirt and I will

46:45.760 --> 46:51.360
 sometimes ask students, where is the blue? And they'll usually say, well, it's in your shirt.

46:52.080 --> 46:56.240
 And then some of them get clear and they say, well, no, you know, light is striking it,

46:56.240 --> 47:01.360
 photons are reemitted, they strike the back of your retina and et cetera, et cetera. And I said,

47:01.360 --> 47:10.880
 yes. What that means is that the blue is actually an artifact of our perceptual system considered as

47:10.880 --> 47:20.400
 the percept of blue. It's not out there, it's in here. That's not how things were thought about

47:21.040 --> 47:28.800
 well into the 16th century. The general notion dating back even to Aristotelian antiquity

47:28.800 --> 47:39.120
 and formalized by the 12th century at Paris, Oxford and elsewhere is that qualities are there

47:39.120 --> 47:48.400
 in the world. They're not in us. We have senses and our senses can be wrong. You could go blind,

47:48.400 --> 47:55.440
 things like that. But if they're working properly, you get the actual qualities of the world.

47:55.440 --> 48:02.960
 Now, that break, which is occurring towards the end of the 16th century and is most visible in

48:02.960 --> 48:11.280
 Descartes, is the break between conceiving that the qualities of the world are very different

48:12.160 --> 48:17.920
 from the qualities that we perceive. That in fact, the qualities of the world consist almost

48:17.920 --> 48:28.640
 entirely in shapes of various kinds and maybe hard particles or whatever, but not colors,

48:28.640 --> 48:36.240
 not sounds, not smells, not softness and hardness. They're not in the world, they're in us.

48:37.840 --> 48:43.280
 That break Newton is picking up as he reads Descartes. He's going to disagree with a lot in

48:43.280 --> 48:50.800
 Descartes, but that break he is, among other things, picking up very strongly. And that

48:50.800 --> 48:58.080
 underlies a lot of the way he works later on when he becomes skeptical of the evidence provided

48:58.080 --> 49:05.040
 by the senses. Yeah, that's actually, I don't know, the way you're describing is so powerful.

49:05.040 --> 49:11.920
 It just makes me realize how liberating that is as a scientist, as somebody who's trying

49:11.920 --> 49:24.480
 to understand reality, that our senses are not to be trusted, that reality is to be investigated

49:24.480 --> 49:33.280
 through tools that are beyond our senses. Yes, or that improve our senses in some ways.

49:34.320 --> 49:49.680
 That's pretty powerful. For a human being to realize I can't trust my own senses at that time,

49:49.680 --> 49:59.040
 that's pretty trippy. It's coming in, it's coming in. And I think it arises probably a fair number

49:59.040 --> 50:05.520
 of decades before that, perhaps in part with all chemical experimentation and manipulations,

50:05.520 --> 50:12.560
 that you have to go through elaborate structures to produce things and ways you think about it.

50:13.280 --> 50:17.680
 But let me give you an example that I think you might find interesting because it's from

50:17.680 --> 50:24.640
 it involves that guy named Hooke that Newton had an argument with. And he had lots of arguments

50:24.640 --> 50:30.400
 with Hooke, although Hooke was a very clever guy and gave him some things that stimulated him later.

50:30.400 --> 50:38.720
 Anyway, Hooke, who was argumentative, and he really was convinced that the only way to gain

50:38.720 --> 50:47.440
 real knowledge of nature is through carefully constructed devices. And he was an expert

50:48.080 --> 50:59.520
 mechanic, if you will, at building such things. Now, there was a rather wealthy man in Danzig

51:00.320 --> 51:06.720
 by the name of Hevelius, Latinized name. He was a brewer in town. And he had become very

51:06.720 --> 51:14.720
 fascinated with the telescope. This is 30 years or so, 20 or 30 years after the telescope had

51:14.720 --> 51:21.920
 moved out and become more common. And he built a large observatory on the top of his brewery,

51:21.920 --> 51:32.080
 actually. And working with his wife, they used these very elaborately constructed

51:32.080 --> 51:37.600
 grass and metal instruments to make observations of positions of the stars. And he published a whole

51:37.600 --> 51:45.120
 new catalog of where the stars are. And he claimed it was incredibly accurate. He claimed it was so

51:45.120 --> 51:50.560
 accurate that nothing had ever come close to it. Hooke reads this, and he says, wait a minute,

51:51.120 --> 51:56.960
 you didn't use a telescope here of any kind, because what's the point? Unless you do something

51:56.960 --> 52:02.480
 to the telescope, all you see are dots with stars. You just use your eyes. Your eyes can't be that

52:02.480 --> 52:08.000
 good. It's impossible. So what did Hooke do to prove this? He said, what you should have done

52:08.000 --> 52:12.720
 is you should have put a little device in the telescope that lets you measure distances between

52:12.720 --> 52:17.440
 these dots. You didn't do that. And because you didn't, there's no way you could have been that

52:17.440 --> 52:27.200
 good. At two successive meetings of the Royal Society, he hauls the members out into the courtyard

52:28.000 --> 52:34.960
 and he takes a card and he makes successive black and white stripes on the card. And he pastes the

52:34.960 --> 52:42.080
 card up on a wall and he takes them one by one. He says, now move back looking at it, presumably

52:42.080 --> 52:48.960
 with one eye, until you can't tell the black ones from the white stripes. He says, that I can then

52:48.960 --> 52:56.880
 measure the distance. I can see the angles. I can give a number then for what is the best possible,

52:57.360 --> 53:05.280
 what we would call perceptual acuity of human vision. And it turned out, he thought, to be

53:05.280 --> 53:12.560
 something like 10 or more times worse than this guy Hevelius had claimed. So obviously he says,

53:12.560 --> 53:21.120
 Hooke, Hevelius. Well, years ago, I calculated Hevelius's numbers and so on using modern

53:22.080 --> 53:28.000
 tables from NASA and so on. And they are even more accurate than Hevelius claimed. And worse than

53:28.000 --> 53:35.600
 that, the Royal Society sent a young astronomer named Halley over to Dantzig to work with him.

53:35.600 --> 53:41.120
 And Halley writes back and he says, I couldn't believe it, but he taught me how to do it.

53:41.120 --> 53:46.080
 And I could get just as good as he. How is it possible? Well, here, this shows you something

53:46.080 --> 53:52.400
 very interesting about experiments, perception and everything else. Hooke was right, but he was also

53:52.400 --> 53:59.200
 wrong. He was wrong for the right reasons and he was right for the wrong reasons. And what do I

53:59.200 --> 54:09.040
 mean by that? What he actually found was the number for what we now call 2020 vision. He was

54:09.040 --> 54:16.960
 right. You can't tell, except a few people, much better than that. But he was observing the wrong

54:16.960 --> 54:26.720
 thing. What Hevelius was observing was a bright dot, a star, moving past a pointer.

54:28.240 --> 54:34.960
 Our eyes are rather similar to frogs eyes. You know, I'm sure you've heard the story. If I hold

54:34.960 --> 54:41.360
 a dead fly on a string in front of a frog and don't move it, the frog pays no attention. As soon

54:41.360 --> 54:48.960
 as I move the fly, the frog immediately tongue lats out because the visual system of the frog

54:48.960 --> 54:58.160
 responds to motion. So does ours and our acuity for distinguishing motion from statics, five or

54:58.160 --> 55:06.240
 more times better. Yeah, that's fascinating. Damn. And of course, I mean, maybe you can comment on

55:06.240 --> 55:11.040
 their understanding of the human perceptual system at the time. It's probably really terrible.

55:12.080 --> 55:16.800
 Like, yeah, like I've recently been working with just almost as a fun side thing with vision

55:16.800 --> 55:23.200
 scientists and peripheral vision. It's a, it's a beautiful, complex mess. That whole thing,

55:23.200 --> 55:28.480
 we still don't understand all the weird ways that human perception works. And they were probably

55:29.120 --> 55:34.400
 terrible at it. They probably didn't even have any conceptual peripheral vision or anything like

55:34.400 --> 55:40.880
 any conceptual peripheral vision or, or the fovea or, or, I mean, basically anything.

55:41.680 --> 55:46.320
 They had some, I mean, because actually it was Newton himself who probed a lot of this. For

55:46.320 --> 55:53.280
 instance, Newton, the young Newton trying to work his way around what's going on with colors,

55:53.920 --> 56:01.440
 wanted to try and distinguish colors that occur through natural processes out there and colors

56:01.440 --> 56:06.960
 that are a result of our eyes not operating whites. You know what he did? It's a famous thing.

56:06.960 --> 56:13.760
 He took a stick and he stuck that stick under his lower eyelid and pushed up on his eyeball.

56:14.640 --> 56:22.960
 And what that did, what produced colored circles at diametrically opposite positions of the stick

56:22.960 --> 56:27.600
 in the eyeball. And he moved it around to see how they moved, trying to distinguish.

56:27.600 --> 56:32.320
 Legit. Right? I always have to tell my students don't do this, but.

56:34.320 --> 56:40.960
 Or do it if you want to be great and remembered by human history. That's, there's a lot of

56:40.960 --> 56:47.520
 equivalent to sticking a stick into your eye in modern day that may pay off in the end. Okay.

56:51.360 --> 56:55.120
 As a small aside, is the Newton and the Apple story true?

56:55.120 --> 56:57.920
 No. Was it a different fruit?

57:00.240 --> 57:06.560
 As a colleague of mine named Simon Schaffer in England once said on a Nova program that we were

57:06.560 --> 57:12.880
 both on, the role of fruit in the history of science has been vastly exaggerated.

57:13.920 --> 57:19.840
 Okay. So was there any, I mean, to, to the zoom out moments of epiphany,

57:19.840 --> 57:24.480
 is, is there something to moments of epiphany? Oh, again, this is the paradigm shift versus the

57:24.480 --> 57:30.800
 gradualism. There is a shift. It's a much more complex one than that. And we,

57:33.920 --> 57:39.040
 as it happens, a colleague of mine and I are writing a paper right now on one of the aspects

57:39.040 --> 57:44.960
 of these things based on the work that many of our colleagues have done over the last 30 and 40 years.

57:44.960 --> 57:56.320
 Let me try and see if I could put it to you this way. Newton, until the early 1670s and probably

57:56.320 --> 58:03.040
 really until a fair time after that, first of all, was not very interested in questions of motion.

58:03.680 --> 58:09.360
 He was working actually in all chemical relationships or what is called by historians

58:09.360 --> 58:15.600
 chymistry, a kind of early modern chemical structure. Colleagues of ours at Indiana have

58:15.600 --> 58:23.680
 even reproduced the amalgams that, you know, anyway, his way of thinking about motion involved

58:23.680 --> 58:35.120
 a certain set of relationships, which was not conducive to any application of motion.

58:35.120 --> 58:46.000
 Not conducive to any application that would yield computationally direct results for things like

58:46.000 --> 58:54.720
 planetary motions, which he wasn't terribly interested in anyway. He enters a correspondence

58:54.720 --> 59:00.560
 with his original nemesis, Robert Hooke. And Hooke says, well, have you ever thought about,

59:00.560 --> 59:05.440
 and then Hooke tells him a certain way you might think about it. And when Newton hears that,

59:06.800 --> 59:13.120
 he recognizes that there is a way to inject time that would enable him to solve certain problems.

59:14.240 --> 59:21.520
 It's not that there was anything he thought before that was contrary to that way of thinking,

59:21.520 --> 59:28.160
 it's just that that particular technical insight was not something that,

59:28.160 --> 59:34.560
 for a lot of reasons that are complex, had never occurred to him at all. And that sent him a

59:34.560 --> 59:39.760
 different way of thinking. But to answer your question about the Apple business, which is always

59:39.760 --> 59:47.440
 about, you know, gravity and the moon and all of that being, no. The reason there is that the idea

59:48.000 --> 59:55.760
 that what goes on here in the neighborhood of the earth and what goes on at the moon,

59:55.760 --> 1:00:02.800
 at the moon, let us say, remind the sun and the planets, can be due to a direct relationship

1:00:03.360 --> 1:00:13.520
 between the earth, let's say, and the moon, is contrary to fundamental beliefs held by many of

1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:18.720
 the mechanical philosophers, as they're called at the time, in which everything has to involve

1:00:18.720 --> 1:00:26.400
 at least a sequence of direct contacts, has to be something between here and there that's involved.

1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:33.440
 And Hooke, probably not thinking terribly deeply about it, based on what he said,

1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:37.200
 along with others, like the architect and mathematician Christopher Wren,

1:00:37.840 --> 1:00:44.160
 harken back to the notion that, well, maybe there is a kind of magnetic relationship between the

1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:49.600
 moon and maybe the planets and the earth and gravity and so on, vague, but establishing a

1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:56.240
 direct connection somehow, however it's happening, forget about it. Newton wouldn't have cared about

1:00:56.240 --> 1:01:01.120
 that, if that's all they said, but it was when Hooke mentioned this different way of thinking

1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:05.920
 about the motion, a way he could certainly have thought of, because it does not contradict

1:01:05.920 --> 1:01:13.840
 anything. Newton is a brilliant mathematician, and he could see that you could suddenly start

1:01:13.840 --> 1:01:19.840
 to do things with that, that you otherwise wouldn't, and this led eventually to another

1:01:19.840 --> 1:01:24.720
 controversy with Hooke, in which Hooke said, well, after Newton published his Great Principia,

1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:30.240
 I gave him how to do this. And then Newton, of course, got ticked off about that and said, well,

1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:34.640
 listen to this, I did everything, and because he had a picayune little idea,

1:01:34.640 --> 1:01:43.040
 he thinks he can take credit for it. Okay. So his ability to play with his ideas mathematically is

1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:48.000
 what solidified the initial intuition that you could have. Was that the first time he was born,

1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:54.000
 the idea that you have action at a distance, that you can have forces without contact,

1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:02.000
 which is another revolutionary idea? I would say that in the sense of dealing with

1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:14.160
 the mechanics of force like effects considered to act at some distance, it is novel with both

1:02:14.160 --> 1:02:21.200
 Hooke and Newton at the time. The notion that two things might interact at a distance with one

1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:26.240
 another without direct contact, that goes back to antiquity. Only there it would be thought of

1:02:26.240 --> 1:02:35.040
 more as a sympathetic reaction to a magnet and a piece of iron. They have a kind of mutual sympathy

1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:41.520
 for one another. Like what? Love? What are we talking about? Actually, they do sometimes talk

1:02:41.520 --> 1:02:49.040
 like that. That is love. See, now I talk like that all the time. I think love is somehow

1:02:49.040 --> 1:02:58.720
 in consciousness or forces of physics that yet to be discovered. Okay. Now there's the other side

1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:03.760
 of things, which is calculus that you began to talk about. So Newton brought a lot of things

1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:13.040
 to this world. One of them is calculus. What is calculus? And what was Newton's role in bringing

1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:21.200
 it to life? What was it like? What was the story of bringing calculus to this world? Well, since

1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:28.000
 the publication starting many decades ago by Tom Whiteside, who's now deceased, of Newton's

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:34.640
 mathematical papers, we know a lot about how he was pushing things and how he was developing things.

1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:42.560
 It's a complex question to say what calculus is. Calculus is the set of mathematical techniques

1:03:42.560 --> 1:03:49.840
 that enable you to investigate what we now call functions, mathematical functions,

1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:58.240
 which are continuous. That is, that are not formed out of discrete sets like the counting numbers,

1:03:58.800 --> 1:04:11.520
 for instance. Newton, there were already procedures for solving problems involving

1:04:11.520 --> 1:04:20.080
 such things as finding areas to under curves and tangents to curves by using geometrical structures,

1:04:20.720 --> 1:04:31.520
 but only for certain limited types of curves, if you will. Newton as a young man, we know this is

1:04:31.520 --> 1:04:42.160
 what happened, is looking at a formula which involves an expansion in separate terms, polynomial

1:04:42.160 --> 1:04:48.880
 terms, as we say, for certain functions. I know I don't want to get complicated here about this,

1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:55.920
 and he realizes it could be generalized. And he tries the generalization and that leads him to

1:04:55.920 --> 1:05:03.840
 an expansion formula called the binomial theorem. That enables him to move ahead with the notion

1:05:03.840 --> 1:05:10.960
 that if I take something that has a certain value, and I add a little bit to it, and I use

1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:17.360
 this binomial theorem and expand things out, I can begin to do new things. And the new things that

1:05:17.360 --> 1:05:24.960
 he begins to do leads him to a recognition that the calculations of areas and the calculations

1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:33.920
 of tangents to curves are reciprocal to one another. And the procedures that he develops

1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:43.520
 is a particular form of the calculus in which he considers small increments and then continuous

1:05:43.520 --> 1:05:52.560
 flows and changes of curves and so on. And we have relics of it in physics today, the notation

1:05:52.560 --> 1:05:59.360
 in which you put a dot over a variable indicating the rate of change of the variable. That's

1:05:59.360 --> 1:06:06.400
 Newton's original type of notation. The dot. Yeah, the dot notation.

1:06:09.920 --> 1:06:16.560
 Possibly independently of Newton, because he didn't publish this thing, although he became

1:06:16.560 --> 1:06:24.720
 quite well known as quite a brilliant young man, in part because people heard about his work and

1:06:24.720 --> 1:06:34.320
 so on. When another young man by the name of Gottfried Leibniz visited London and he heard

1:06:34.320 --> 1:06:42.160
 about these things, it is said that he independently develops his form of the calculus,

1:06:42.160 --> 1:06:47.840
 which is actually the form we use today, both in notation and perhaps in certain

1:06:47.840 --> 1:06:56.160
 fundamental ways of thinking. It has remained a controversial point as to where exactly and how

1:06:56.160 --> 1:07:02.400
 much independently Leibniz did it. Leibniz aficionados think and continue to maintain he

1:07:02.400 --> 1:07:08.000
 did it completely independently. Newton, when he became president of the Royal Society, put together

1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:13.520
 a group to go on the attack saying, no, he must have taken everything. We don't know.

1:07:14.720 --> 1:07:23.200
 But I will tell you this. About 25 or so years ago, a scholar who's a professor at Indiana now

1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:31.440
 named Domenico Melli got his hands on a Leibniz manuscript called the Tentamen,

1:07:31.440 --> 1:07:36.720
 which was Leibniz's attempt to produce an alternative to Newton's mechanics.

1:07:36.720 --> 1:07:37.760
 Mm hmm.

1:07:37.760 --> 1:07:43.360
 And it comes to some conclusions that you have in Newton's mechanics. Well, he published that,

1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:49.520
 but Melli got the manuscript. And what Melli found out was that Leibniz reverse engineered

1:07:49.520 --> 1:07:55.520
 the Principia and cooked it backwards so that he could get the results he wanted.

1:07:55.520 --> 1:07:59.680
 That was for the mechanics. So that means his mind allows for that kind of thing.

1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:00.240
 Some people.

1:08:00.960 --> 1:08:04.320
 You're breaking some news today. You're starting some whole drama.

1:08:04.320 --> 1:08:08.960
 Some people think so. I think most historians of mathematics do not agree with that.

1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:15.280
 A friend of mine, rather well known physicist, unfortunately, died a couple of years ago named

1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:22.480
 Mike Nowenberg at UC Santa Cruz, had some evidence along those lines. Didn't pass mustard

1:08:23.040 --> 1:08:28.720
 with many of my friends who are historians of math. In fact, I edit with a historian of math,

1:08:28.720 --> 1:08:33.920
 a technical journal, and we were unable to publish it in there because we couldn't get

1:08:33.920 --> 1:08:39.680
 it through any of our colleagues. But I am, I remain suspicious.

1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:47.040
 What is it about those tense relationships and that kind of drama? Einstein doesn't

1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:52.320
 appear to have much of that drama. Nobody claimed, I haven't heard claims that they've,

1:08:53.360 --> 1:09:00.640
 perhaps because it's such crazy ideas, of any of his major inventions, major ideas,

1:09:00.640 --> 1:09:06.560
 being those that are basically, I came up with it first or independently. There's not,

1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:12.880
 as far as I'm aware, not many people talk about general relativity, especially in those terms.

1:09:12.880 --> 1:09:20.320
 But with Newton, that was the case. I mean, is that just a natural outgrowth of how science works?

1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:25.040
 Is there going to be personalities that, I'm not saying this about Linus, but maybe I am,

1:09:25.040 --> 1:09:35.040
 but there's people who steal ideas for the, because of ego, because of all those kinds of things.

1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:42.400
 I don't think it's all that common, frankly. The Newton book, Leibniz, Contratemps and so on.

1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:48.240
 Well, you're at the beginnings of a lot of things there and so on. These are difficult

1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:57.920
 and complex times as well. These are times in which science as an activity pursued by other than,

1:09:57.920 --> 1:10:05.440
 let us say, interested aristocrats is becoming something somewhat different. It's not

1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:12.000
 a professional community of investigators in the same way. It's also a period in which

1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:23.120
 procedures and rules or practice are being developed to avoid attacking one another directly

1:10:23.120 --> 1:10:28.240
 and pulling out a sword to cut off the other guy's head if he disagrees with you and so on.

1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:35.440
 So it's a very different period. Controversies happen. People get angry. I can think of a number

1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:42.560
 of others, including in the development of optics in the 19th century and so on, and it can get hot

1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:50.640
 under the collar. Sometimes one character who's worked an area extensively, whether they've come

1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:57.840
 up with something terribly novel or not, and somebody else kind of moves in and does completely

1:10:57.840 --> 1:11:03.840
 different and novel things, the first guy gets upset about it because he's sort of muscled into

1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:10.240
 what I thought was my area. You find that sort of stuff. But do you have examples of cases where it

1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:16.240
 worked out well, like that competition is good for the progress of science? Yeah, it almost always is

1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:21.520
 good in that sense. It's just painful for the individuals involved. It can be. It doesn't have

1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:28.880
 to be nasty, although sometimes it is. So for the example with optics, could you comment on that one?

1:11:28.880 --> 1:11:36.720
 Well, yeah, sure. There are several, but I could give you... All right, so I'll give you this

1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:49.280
 example that probably is the most pertinent. The first polytechnic school like MIT or Caltech was

1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:53.760
 actually founded in France during the French Revolution. It exists today. It's the Ecole

1:11:53.760 --> 1:12:06.160
 Polytechnique. Two people who were there were two young men in the 90s, 1790s named on the one hand

1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:13.040
 Francois Arago and the other Jean Baptiste Biot. They both lived a long time, well into the 1850s.

1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:22.160
 Arago became a major administrator of science and Biot's career started to peter out after about the

1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:30.880
 late teens. Now, they are sent on an expedition, which was one of the expeditions involving

1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:36.320
 measuring things to start the metric system. There's a lot more to that story. Anyway,

1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:46.560
 they come back. Arago gets separated. He's captured by pirates actually. Wounds up in

1:12:46.560 --> 1:12:55.440
 Tangier, escapes, is captured again. Everybody thinks he's dead. He gets back to Paris and so on.

1:12:55.440 --> 1:13:00.640
 He's greeted as a hero and whatnot. In the meantime, Biot has pretty much published some

1:13:00.640 --> 1:13:05.680
 of the stuff that he's done and Arago doesn't get much credit for it and Arago starts to get very

1:13:05.680 --> 1:13:17.920
 angry and Biot is known for this kind of thing. Biot starts investigating a new phenomenon in

1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:24.160
 optics involving something called polarization and he writes all kinds of stuff on it. Arago

1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:33.040
 looks into this and decides to write some things as well and actually Biot gets mostly interested

1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:38.880
 in it when he finds out that Arago is doing stuff. Now, Biot is actually the better scientist

1:13:38.880 --> 1:13:46.800
 in a lot of ways, but Arago is furious about this. So furious that he actually demands and

1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:57.360
 forces the leader of French science, Laplace, the Marquis de Laplace and cohorts to write a note in

1:13:57.360 --> 1:14:05.760
 the published journal saying, oh, excuse us, actually Arago, et cetera, et cetera, blah, blah.

1:14:05.760 --> 1:14:16.080
 So Arago continues to just hold this antipathy and fear of Biot. So what happens? 1815,

1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:24.240
 Napoleon is finished at Waterloo. A young Frenchman by the name of Augustin Fresnel

1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:31.040
 who was in the army is going back to his home on the north coast of France in Normandy,

1:14:31.040 --> 1:14:39.360
 passes through Paris. Arago is friends with Fresnel's uncle who's the head of the École des

1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:45.680
 Beaux Arts at the time. Anyway, Fresnel is already interested in certain things in light

1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:51.200
 and he talks to Arago. Arago tells him a few things. Fresnel goes home and Fresnel is a

1:14:51.200 --> 1:15:00.080
 brilliant experimenter. He observes things and he's a very good mathematician, calculates things,

1:15:00.080 --> 1:15:05.520
 he writes something up, he sends it to Arago. Arago looks at it and Arago says to himself,

1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:12.560
 I can use this to get back at Biot. He brings Fresnel to Paris, sets him up in

1:15:13.200 --> 1:15:19.680
 a room at the observatory where Arago is for Fresnel to continue his work. Paper after paper

1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:31.200
 comes out undercutting everything Biot had done. What is it about jealousy and just envy that

1:15:31.200 --> 1:15:39.280
 could be an engine of creativity and productivity versus like an Einstein where it seems like not?

1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:44.480
 I don't know which one is better. I guess it depends on the personality. Both are useful

1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:51.280
 engines in science. Well, in this particular story, it's maybe even more interesting because

1:15:51.280 --> 1:15:57.440
 Fresnel himself, the young guy, he knew what Arago was doing with him and he didn't like it.

1:15:58.080 --> 1:16:03.120
 He didn't want to get with, he wrote his brother said, I don't want to get in an argument with Biot,

1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:10.000
 I just want to do my stuff. Arago is using him, but it's because Arago kept pushing him to go

1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:20.480
 into certain areas that stuff kept coming out. Yeah. Ego is beautiful. Okay. But back to Newton,

1:16:21.040 --> 1:16:26.160
 there's a bunch of things I want to ask, but sort of, let's say since we're on the Leibniz

1:16:26.160 --> 1:16:31.760
 and the topic of drama, let me ask another drama question. Why was Newton a complicated man?

1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:41.760
 We're breaking news today. This is like. Right. Why was he complicated? His

1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:47.120
 brain structure was different. I don't know why. He had a complicated young life, as we've said.

1:16:48.720 --> 1:16:56.720
 He had always been very self contained and solitary. He had acquaintances and friends.

1:16:56.720 --> 1:17:02.560
 And when he moved to London eventually, he had quite a career. A career, for instance, that led

1:17:02.560 --> 1:17:10.560
 him when he was famous by then, the 1690s, he moves to London. He becomes first warden of the

1:17:10.560 --> 1:17:15.520
 mint. The mint is what produces coins and coinage was a complicated thing because there was

1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:23.360
 counterfeiting going on. And he becomes master of the mint to the extent. And a guy at MIT wrote a

1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:30.480
 book about this a little bit. We wrote something on it too. I forget his name was Levin. That Newton

1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:36.640
 sent investigators out to catch these guys and sent at least one of them, a famous one named

1:17:36.640 --> 1:17:47.280
 Challener to the gallows. And one of the reasons he probably was so particularly angry at Challener

1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:52.800
 was Challener had apparently said some nasty things about Newton in front of parliament at

1:17:52.800 --> 1:17:58.800
 some point. Fair enough. That was apparently not a good idea. Well, he had a bit of a temper. So

1:17:58.800 --> 1:18:08.560
 you had a bit of a temper. Clearly. But he even as a young man at Cambridge, though he doesn't come

1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:16.800
 from wealth, he attracts people who recognize his smarts. There's a young fellow named Humphrey

1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:23.680
 Newton shared his rooms. These students always shared rooms with one another, became his kind

1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:34.240
 of amanuensis to write down what Newton was doing and so on. And there were others over time who he

1:18:34.240 --> 1:18:42.880
 befriended in various ways and so on. He was solitary. He had, as far as we know, no relationships

1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:49.360
 with either women or men in anything other than a formal way. The only...

1:18:49.360 --> 1:18:51.360
 Those get in the way relationships.

1:18:51.360 --> 1:18:58.320
 Right. Well, I mean, I don't know if he was close to his mother. I mean, she passed away,

1:18:58.320 --> 1:19:04.160
 everything left him. He went to be with her after she died. He was close to his niece,

1:19:04.160 --> 1:19:13.200
 Catherine Barton, who basically came to run his household when he moved to London and so on. And

1:19:13.200 --> 1:19:21.120
 she married a man named Conduit, who became one of the people who controlled Newton's legacy

1:19:21.920 --> 1:19:29.840
 later on and so on. And you can even see the townhouse that Newton lived in, in those days,

1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:30.400
 still there.

1:19:30.400 --> 1:19:37.120
 All right. So there's the story of Newton coming up with quite a few ideas during a pandemic.

1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:42.640
 We're on the outskirts of a pandemic ourselves.

1:19:42.640 --> 1:19:43.040
 Right.

1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:47.360
 And a lot of people use that example as motivation for everybody while they're

1:19:47.360 --> 1:19:52.560
 in lockdown to get stuff done. So what's that about? Can you tell the story of that?

1:19:53.120 --> 1:19:58.080
 Well, I can. Let me first say that, of course, we've been teaching over Zoom lately.

1:19:58.080 --> 1:20:00.080
 There was no Zoom back then?

1:20:00.080 --> 1:20:04.480
 There was no Zoom back then. Although it wouldn't have made much difference because the story was

1:20:04.480 --> 1:20:09.920
 Newton was so complicated in his lectures that at one point, Humphrey Newton actually said that

1:20:09.920 --> 1:20:12.720
 he might as well have just been lecturing to the walls because nobody was there

1:20:13.600 --> 1:20:15.680
 to listen to it. So what difference?

1:20:15.680 --> 1:20:17.600
 Also not a great teacher, huh?

1:20:18.880 --> 1:20:22.960
 If you look at his optical notes, if that's what he's reading from...

1:20:22.960 --> 1:20:23.840
 Oh, boy. Okay.

1:20:23.840 --> 1:20:27.920
 No.

1:20:27.920 --> 1:20:35.120
 So what can you say about that whole journey through the pandemic that resulted in so much

1:20:35.120 --> 1:20:37.440
 innovation in such a short amount of time?

1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:45.280
 Well, I mean, there's two times that he goes home. Would he have been able to do it and do do it if

1:20:45.280 --> 1:20:50.640
 he'd stayed at Cambridge? I think he would have. I don't think it really... Although I do like to

1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:55.520
 tell my advanced students when I lecture on the history of physics to the physics and chemistry

1:20:55.520 --> 1:21:00.560
 students, especially we've been doing it over Zoom last year, when we get to Newton and so on,

1:21:00.560 --> 1:21:06.400
 because these kids are, you know, 21, 22, I like to say, well, you know, when Newton was your age

1:21:06.960 --> 1:21:11.200
 and he had to go home during an epidemic, do you know what he produced?

1:21:12.320 --> 1:21:16.320
 So can you actually summarize this for people who don't know how old was Newton and what did

1:21:16.320 --> 1:21:23.520
 he produce? Well, Newton goes up to Cambridge, as it said, when he's 18 years old in 1660.

1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:32.080
 And the so called miraculous year, the annus mirabilis, where you get the development

1:21:32.080 --> 1:21:40.000
 in the calculus and in optical discoveries, especially, is 1666, right? So he's, what,

1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:48.400
 24 years old at the time. But judging from the notebooks that I mentioned, he's already,

1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:55.200
 before that, come to an awful lot of developments over the previous couple of years.

1:21:56.720 --> 1:22:03.280
 Does it have much to do with the fact that he twice went home? It is true that the optical

1:22:03.280 --> 1:22:08.400
 experiments that we talked of a while ago with the light on the wall moving up and down were done at

1:22:08.400 --> 1:22:14.560
 home. In fact, you can visit the very room he did it in to this day. Yeah, it's very cool.

1:22:15.120 --> 1:22:21.280
 And if you look through the window in that room, there is an apple tree out there in the garden.

1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:25.600
 So you might be wrong about this. You're lying to me. Maybe there's an apple

1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:29.760
 involved after all. Well, it's not the same apple tree, but it's cuttings.

1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:30.320
 How do you know?

1:22:31.440 --> 1:22:34.560
 They don't last that long, but it's 400 years ago.

1:22:34.560 --> 1:22:43.040
 Oh, wow. I continue with the dumbest questions. Okay. So you're saying that perhaps going home

1:22:43.040 --> 1:22:50.160
 was not... It may have given him an opportunity to work things through. And after all, he did make

1:22:50.160 --> 1:22:55.520
 use of that room and he could do things like put a shade over the window, move things around,

1:22:55.520 --> 1:23:03.120
 cut holes in it and do stuff. Probably in his rooms at Cambridge, maybe not. Although when he

1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:10.960
 stayed at Cambridge subsequently and became a fellow, and then the second Lucasian professor

1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:18.080
 there, he was actually really the first one because Isaac Barrow, who was the mathematician,

1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:23.440
 professor of optics who recognized Newton's genius, gave up what would have been his position

1:23:24.320 --> 1:23:30.000
 because he recognized... Newton may not have learned too much from him, although they did

1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:35.920
 interact. And so Newton was the first Lucasian professor really, the one that Stephen Hawking

1:23:35.920 --> 1:23:44.480
 held till he died. And we know that the rooms that he had there at Cambridge subsequently,

1:23:44.480 --> 1:23:49.360
 those rooms are still there, he built an all chemical furnace outside, did all sorts of stuff

1:23:49.360 --> 1:23:57.280
 in those rooms. And don't forget, you didn't have to do too much as a Lucasian professor.

1:23:57.280 --> 1:24:01.840
 Every so often you had to go give these lectures, whether anybody was there or not,

1:24:01.840 --> 1:24:08.320
 and deposit the notes for the future, which is how we have all those things.

1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:15.280
 Oh, they were stored and now we have them. And now we know just how terrible of a teacher Newton

1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:20.560
 was. Yeah, but we know how brilliant these notes are. In fact, the second volume of Newton's,

1:24:20.560 --> 1:24:27.920
 of the notes really on the great book that he published, The Optics, which he published in 1704,

1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:35.920
 that has just been finished with full annotations and analysis by the greatest analyst of Newton's

1:24:35.920 --> 1:24:42.080
 optics, Alan Shapiro, who retired a few years ago at the University of Minnesota and been working

1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:48.880
 on Newton's optics ever since I knew him and before, and I've known him since 1976.

1:24:48.880 --> 1:24:57.760
 Is there something you could say broadly about either that work on optics or Principia itself

1:24:57.760 --> 1:25:02.720
 as something that I've never actually looked at as a piece of work?

1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:12.400
 Is it powerful in itself or is it just an important moment in history in terms of the

1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:19.280
 amount of inventions that are within, the amount of ideas that are within, or is it a really powerful

1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:27.680
 work in itself? Well, it is a powerful work in itself. You can see this guy coming to grips with

1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:34.880
 and pushing through and working his way around complicated and difficult issues, melding

1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:42.400
 experimental situations which nobody had worked with before, even discovering new things,

1:25:42.400 --> 1:25:46.320
 trying to figure out ways of putting this together with mathematical structures,

1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:50.720
 succeeding and failing at the same time. And we can see him doing that.

1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:58.640
 I mean, what is, what is contained within Principia? I don't even know in terms of the

1:25:58.640 --> 1:26:04.240
 scope of the work. Is it the entirety of the body of work of Newton?

1:26:04.240 --> 1:26:06.720
 No, no, no, no. The Principia Mathematica...

1:26:06.720 --> 1:26:07.440
 Is it calculus?

1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:14.800
 Well, all right. So the Principia is divided into three books.

1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:15.300
 Excellent.

1:26:16.640 --> 1:26:23.440
 Book one contains his version of the laws of motion and the application of those laws

1:26:23.440 --> 1:26:30.320
 to figure out when a body moves in certain curves and is forced to move in those curves

1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:37.680
 by forces directed to certain fixed points, what is the nature of the mathematical formula

1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:44.240
 for those forces? That's all that book one is about. And it contains not the kind of version

1:26:44.240 --> 1:26:50.080
 of the calculus that uses algebra of the sort that I was trying to explain before,

1:26:50.080 --> 1:27:00.960
 but is done in terms of ratios between geometric line segments when one of the line segments goes

1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:08.320
 very, very small. It's called the kind of limiting procedure, which is calculus, but it's a geometrically

1:27:08.320 --> 1:27:14.960
 structured, although it's clearly got algebraic elements in it as well. And that makes the

1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:21.680
 Principia's mathematical structure rather hard for people who aren't studying it today to

1:27:22.880 --> 1:27:32.720
 go back to. Book two contains his work on what we now call hydrostatics and a little bit about

1:27:34.080 --> 1:27:42.880
 hydrodynamics, a fuller development of the concept of pressure, which is a complicated concept.

1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:51.120
 And book three applies what he did in book one to the solar system. And it is successful

1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:59.920
 partially because the only way that you can exactly solve, the only types of problems you

1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:08.320
 can exactly solve in terms of the interactions of two particles governed by gravitational force

1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:15.440
 between them is for only two bodies. If there's more than two, let's say it's A, B, and C,

1:28:15.440 --> 1:28:24.160
 A acts on B, B acts on C, C acts on A, you cannot solve it exactly. You have to develop techniques.

1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:29.840
 The fullest sets of techniques are really only developed about 30 or 40 years after Newton's

1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:39.360
 death by French mathematicians like Laplace. Newton tried to apply his structure to the

1:28:40.080 --> 1:28:46.160
 sun, earth, moon, because the moon's motion is very complicated. The moon, for instance,

1:28:47.200 --> 1:28:53.520
 exactly repeats its observable position among the stars only every 19 years.

1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:59.280
 That is, if you look up where the moon is among the stars at certain times and it changes,

1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:05.840
 it's complicated. That's, by the way, that was discovered by the Babylonians.

1:29:06.800 --> 1:29:08.320
 That fact, the 19 years.

1:29:08.320 --> 1:29:09.840
 Thousands of years ago, yes.

1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:13.680
 And then you have to load that little piece of data and how do you make sense of it? I mean,

1:29:13.680 --> 1:29:15.280
 that is data and you have to fit it.

1:29:15.280 --> 1:29:21.920
 And it's complicated. So Newton actually kind of reverse engineered a technique that had been

1:29:21.920 --> 1:29:28.480
 developed by a man named Horrocks, using certain laws of Kepler's to try and get around this thing.

1:29:28.480 --> 1:29:32.800
 And Newton then sort of, my understanding, I've never studied this, has reversed,

1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:39.280
 sort of reversed it and fit it together with his force calculations by way of an approximation.

1:29:40.480 --> 1:29:45.120
 And was able to construct a model to make some predictions?

1:29:46.080 --> 1:29:49.680
 It fit things backwards pretty well.

1:29:49.680 --> 1:29:55.360
 Okay. Where does data fit into this? We kind of earlier in the discussion

1:29:57.360 --> 1:30:04.560
 mentioned data as part of the scientific method. How important was data to Newton?

1:30:04.560 --> 1:30:05.440
 Okay.

1:30:05.440 --> 1:30:11.120
 So like you mentioned Prism and playing with it and looking at stuff and then coming up with

1:30:11.120 --> 1:30:14.720
 calculations and so on. Where does data fit into any of his ideas?

1:30:14.720 --> 1:30:20.800
 All right. Well, let me say two things first. One, we rarely use the phrase scientific method

1:30:20.800 --> 1:30:28.880
 anymore because there is no one easily describable such method. I mean, humans have been

1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:34.160
 playing around with the world and learning how to repetitively do things and make things happen

1:30:34.160 --> 1:30:37.200
 ever since, you know, humans became humans.

1:30:37.200 --> 1:30:41.280
 Do you have a preferred definition of the scientific method?

1:30:41.280 --> 1:30:45.840
 Do you have a preferred definition of the scientific method? What are the various?

1:30:46.480 --> 1:30:49.280
 No, I don't. I prefer to talk about

1:30:52.880 --> 1:31:01.040
 the considered manipulation of artificial structures to produce results that can be

1:31:02.160 --> 1:31:08.160
 worked together with schemes to construct other devices and make

1:31:08.160 --> 1:31:11.360
 predictions, if you will, about the way such things will work.

1:31:11.360 --> 1:31:16.080
 So ultimately, it's about producing other devices. It's like leads you down a...

1:31:16.080 --> 1:31:22.720
 I think so, principally. I mean, you may have data, if you will, like astronomical data

1:31:23.280 --> 1:31:30.640
 obtained otherwise and so on, but yes. But number two here is this question of data. What is data

1:31:30.640 --> 1:31:38.800
 in that sense? See, when we talk about data today, we have a kind of complex notion, which

1:31:38.800 --> 1:31:47.920
 reverts to even issues of statistics and measurement procedures and so on. So let me put it to you this

1:31:47.920 --> 1:31:55.760
 way. So let's say I had a ruler in front of me and it's marked off in little black marks separated

1:31:55.760 --> 1:32:03.280
 by, let's say, distances called a millimeter. Okay. Now I make a mark on this piece of paper here.

1:32:03.280 --> 1:32:09.920
 So I made a nice black mark, right? Nice black mark. And I ask you, I want you to measure that

1:32:09.920 --> 1:32:15.840
 and tell me how long it is. You're going to take the ruler, you're going to put it next to it,

1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:24.320
 and you're going to look, and it's not going to sit, even if you put one end in the middle,

1:32:24.320 --> 1:32:29.680
 even if you put one end as close as you can on one black mark, the other end probably isn't going to

1:32:29.680 --> 1:32:35.440
 be exactly on a black mark. Well, you'll say it's closer to this or that. You'll write down a number

1:32:35.440 --> 1:32:40.160
 and I say, okay, take the ruler away a minute. I take this away, come back in five minutes,

1:32:40.160 --> 1:32:44.480
 put the piece of paper down, do it again. You're going to probably come up with a different number

1:32:45.520 --> 1:32:50.000
 and you're going to do that a lot of times. And then if I tell you, I want you to give me your

1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:54.640
 best estimate of what the actual length of that thing is, what are you going to do?

1:32:55.520 --> 1:33:00.080
 You're going to average all of these numbers. Why?

1:33:04.480 --> 1:33:05.280
 Statistics.

1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:10.800
 Well, yes, statistics. There's lots of ways of going around it,

1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:16.720
 but the average is the best estimate on the basis of what's called the central limit theorem,

1:33:16.720 --> 1:33:23.840
 a statistical theorem. We're talking about things that were not really developed until the 1750s,

1:33:23.840 --> 1:33:26.880
 60s and 70s. Newton died in 1727.

1:33:26.880 --> 1:33:28.800
 The intuition perhaps was there.

1:33:28.800 --> 1:33:33.440
 Not really. I'll tell you what people did, including Newton, although Newton is

1:33:33.440 --> 1:33:38.240
 partially the one exception. We talked a while ago about this guy, Christian Huygens.

1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:45.680
 He measured lots of things and he was a good mechanic himself. He and his brother ground

1:33:45.680 --> 1:33:51.680
 lenses. Huygens, I told you, developed the first pendulum mechanism, pendulum driven clock with a

1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:58.080
 mechanism and so on. Also a spring watch where he got into a controversy with Hooke over that,

1:33:58.080 --> 1:33:58.640
 by the way.

1:34:00.240 --> 1:34:02.800
 What's with these mechanics and the controversy?

1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:12.960
 Well, we also have Huygens's notes. They're preserved at Leiden University in Holland,

1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:18.960
 he's Dutch, for his work in optics, which was extensive. We don't have time to go into that,

1:34:18.960 --> 1:34:23.920
 except the following. A number of years ago, I went through those things because

1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:30.480
 in this optical theory that he had, there are four numbers that you've got to be able to get

1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:37.360
 good numbers on to be able to predict other things. What would we do today? What in fact

1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:42.480
 was done at the end of the 18th century when somebody went back to this? I told you to do

1:34:42.480 --> 1:34:48.240
 with the ruler. You make a lot of measurements and average results. We have Huygens's notes.

1:34:48.240 --> 1:34:56.240
 He did make a lot of measurements, one after the other, after the other. But when he came to use

1:34:56.240 --> 1:35:01.920
 the numbers for calculations, and indeed when he published things at the end of his life,

1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:09.360
 he gives you one number and it's not the average of any of them. It's just one of them. Which one

1:35:09.360 --> 1:35:20.080
 was it? The one that he thought he got so good at working by practice that he put down the one he

1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:26.880
 was most confident in. That was the general procedure at the time. You wouldn't publish

1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:32.320
 a paper in which you wrote down six numbers and said, well, I measured this six times.

1:35:32.320 --> 1:35:37.360
 Let me put them together. None of them is really, they would have said, the right number,

1:35:37.360 --> 1:35:42.240
 but I'll put them together and give you a good number. No, you would have been thought of that,

1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:49.440
 you know, you don't know what you're doing. Yeah. By the way, there's just an inkling of value to

1:35:49.440 --> 1:35:56.800
 that approach. Just an inkling. We sometimes use statistics as like a thing that like, oh,

1:35:56.800 --> 1:36:01.760
 that solves all the problems. We'll just do a lot of it and we'll take the average or whatever it

1:36:01.760 --> 1:36:08.640
 is. As many excellent books on mathematics have highlighted the flaws in our approach to certain

1:36:08.640 --> 1:36:16.800
 sciences that rely heavily on statistics. Okay. Let me ask you again for a friend about this

1:36:16.800 --> 1:36:24.160
 alchemy thing. You know, it'd be nice to create gold, but it also seems to come into play quite

1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:30.320
 a bit throughout the history of science, perhaps in positive ways in terms of its impact. Can you

1:36:30.320 --> 1:36:40.480
 say something to the history of alchemy? A little bit. Sure. It used to be thought two things. One,

1:36:40.480 --> 1:36:48.080
 that alchemy, which dates certainly back to the Islamic period in Islam, you're talking, you know,

1:36:49.040 --> 1:36:54.720
 11th, 12th, 13th centuries among Islamic natural philosophers and experimenters.

1:36:54.720 --> 1:37:03.360
 But it used to be thought that alchemy, which picked up strikingly in the 16th century, 1500s

1:37:03.360 --> 1:37:12.080
 and thereabouts, was a sort of mystical procedure involving all sorts of strange notions and so on.

1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:20.240
 And that's not entirely untrue, but it is substantially untrue in that alchemists were

1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:32.480
 engaged in what was known as chrysopoeia, that is looking for ways to transform invaluable materials

1:37:32.480 --> 1:37:42.000
 into valuable ones. But in the process of doing so or attempting to do so, they learned how to

1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:49.920
 create complex amalgams of various kinds. They used very elaborate apparatus, glass

1:37:49.920 --> 1:37:57.360
 alembics in which they would use heat to produce chemical decompositions. They would write down and

1:37:57.360 --> 1:38:03.840
 observe these compositions. And many of the so called really strange looking alchemical formulas

1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:09.360
 and statements where they'll say something like, I can't produce it, but it'll be the soul of

1:38:09.360 --> 1:38:18.720
 Mars will combine with this, et cetera, et cetera. These, it has been shown, are almost all actual

1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:26.960
 formulas for how to engage in the production of complex amalgams and what to do. And by the time

1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:34.960
 of Newton, Newton was reading the works of a fellow by the name of Starkey, who actually came

1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:45.360
 from Harvard shortly before, in which things had progressed, if you will, to the point where

1:38:45.360 --> 1:38:52.640
 the procedure turns into what historians call chrysopoeia, which basically runs into the notion

1:38:52.640 --> 1:39:00.000
 of thinking that these things are made out of particles. This is the mechanical philosophy.

1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:06.800
 This is the mechanical philosophy. Can we engage in processes, chemical processes to rearrange these

1:39:06.800 --> 1:39:12.800
 things, which is not so stupid after all. I mean, we do it, except we happen to do it in reactors,

1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:18.560
 not in chemical processes, unless of course it had happened that cold fusion had worked,

1:39:18.560 --> 1:39:26.240
 which it didn't. Not yet. Well, right. So that's the way they're thinking about these things.

1:39:26.240 --> 1:39:32.320
 There's a kind of mix. And Newton engages extensively in those sorts of manipulations.

1:39:32.320 --> 1:39:41.360
 In fact, more in that than almost anything else, except for his optical investigations. If you look

1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:47.440
 through the latter parts of the 1670s, the last five, six, seven years or so of that,

1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:53.280
 there's more on that than there is on anything else. He's not working on mechanics. He's pretty

1:39:53.280 --> 1:39:59.760
 much gone pretty far in optics. He'll turn back to optics later on. So optics and alchemy.

1:40:00.400 --> 1:40:07.360
 So what you're saying is Isaac Newton liked shiny things. Well, actually, if you go online and look

1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:13.680
 at what Bill Newman, the professor at Indiana, at Bloomington, Indiana has produced, you'll find

1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:19.760
 the very shiny thing called the star regulus, which Newton describes as having produced according to

1:40:19.760 --> 1:40:24.960
 a particular way, which Newman figured out and was able to do it. And it's very shiny.

1:40:25.920 --> 1:40:33.280
 There you go. Proves the theorem. Can I ask you about God, religion and its role in Newton's life?

1:40:34.720 --> 1:40:47.120
 Was there helpful, constructive or destructive influences of religion in his work and in his life?

1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:55.520
 Well, there you begin to touch on a complex question. The role that God played would be an

1:40:55.520 --> 1:41:00.400
 interesting question to answer should one go and be able to speak with this invisible character

1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:05.200
 who doesn't exist. But putting that aside for the moment. Yeah, we don't like to talk about others

1:41:05.200 --> 1:41:12.560
 while they're not here. So, right. Newton is a deeply religious man, not unusually so,

1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:24.400
 of course, for the time. And clearly, his upbringing and perhaps his early experiences

1:41:24.960 --> 1:41:32.080
 have exacerbated that in a number of ways that he takes a lot of things personally. And he finds

1:41:32.080 --> 1:41:43.280
 perhaps solace in thinking about a sort of governing, abstract, rulemaking, exacting deity.

1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:56.160
 I think there is little question that his conviction that you can figure things out has

1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:05.360
 a fair bit to do with his profound belief that this rulemaker doesn't do things arbitrarily.

1:42:06.720 --> 1:42:14.080
 Newton does not think that miracles have happened since maybe the time of Christ, if then,

1:42:14.080 --> 1:42:20.000
 and not in the same way. He was, for instance, an anti Trinitarian. He did not hold that Christ

1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:26.960
 had a divine being, but was rather endowed with certain powers by the rulemaker and whatnot.

1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:38.720
 And he did not think that some of the tales of the Old Testament with various miracles and so on

1:42:38.720 --> 1:42:44.720
 occurred in anything like that way. Some may have, some may not have. Like everybody else,

1:42:44.720 --> 1:42:51.200
 of course, he did think that creation had happened about 6,000 years ago. Wait, really? Oh, yeah,

1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:56.640
 sure. Well, biblical chronology can give you a little bit about that. It's a little controversial,

1:42:56.640 --> 1:43:06.320
 but sure. Interesting. Wow. The deity created the universe 6,000 years ago. And that didn't

1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:12.480
 interfere with his playing around with the sun and the moon? No, because he's figuring out,

1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:20.720
 he's watching the brilliant construction that this perfect entity did 6,000 years ago.

1:43:21.600 --> 1:43:27.760
 Yeah, has produced. Plus or minus a few years. Well, if you go with Bishop Boster, it's 4004 BCE.

1:43:30.080 --> 1:43:36.080
 Want to be precise about it. We always, and this is a serious program, we always want to be precise.

1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:44.480
 Okay. Let me ask another ridiculous question. If Newton were to travel forward in time

1:43:45.440 --> 1:43:54.880
 and visit with Einstein and have a discussion about space time and general relativity,

1:43:54.880 --> 1:43:59.600
 that conception of time and that conception of gravity, what do you think that discussion will go

1:43:59.600 --> 1:44:07.120
 like? Put that way, I think Newton would sit there in shock and say, I have no idea what you're

1:44:07.120 --> 1:44:13.440
 talking about. If on the other hand, there's a time machine, you go back and bring a somewhat

1:44:13.440 --> 1:44:21.600
 younger Newton, not a man my age, say. I mean, he lived a long time into his mid eighties,

1:44:22.320 --> 1:44:27.280
 but take him when he's in his forties, let's say, bring him forward and don't immediately

1:44:27.280 --> 1:44:33.760
 introduce him to Einstein. Let's take him for a ride on a railroad. Let him experience the

1:44:33.760 --> 1:44:45.920
 railroad. Oh, that's right. Take him around and show him a sparking machine. He knows about sparks,

1:44:45.920 --> 1:44:52.320
 sending off sparks. Show him wires, have him touch the wires and get a little shock.

1:44:52.320 --> 1:45:01.600
 Show him a clicking telegraph machine of the kind. Then let him hear the clicks in a telephone

1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:07.200
 receiver and so on. Do that for a couple of months. Let him get accustomed to things.

1:45:08.480 --> 1:45:14.880
 Then take him into, not Einstein yet, let's say we're taking him into the 1890s. Einstein is

1:45:14.880 --> 1:45:21.040
 young man then. We take him into some of the laboratories. We show him some of the equipment,

1:45:21.040 --> 1:45:26.880
 the devices, not the most elaborate ones. We show him certain things. We educate him

1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:32.960
 bit by bit. On optics, maybe focus on that. Certainly on optics. You begin to show him

1:45:32.960 --> 1:45:40.640
 things. He's a brilliant human being. I think bit by bit, he would begin to see what's going on.

1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:46.640
 But if you just dumped him in front of Einstein, he'd sit there, his eyes would glaze over.

1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:57.760
 I mean, I guess it's almost a question of how big of a leap, how many leaps have been taken

1:45:57.760 --> 1:46:02.960
 in science that go from Newton to Einstein. We sometimes in a compressed version of history

1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:13.200
 think that not much. Oh, that's totally wrong. A lot. Huge amounts in multifarious ways

1:46:13.200 --> 1:46:19.360
 involving fundamental conceptions, mathematical structures, the evolution of novel experimentation

1:46:19.360 --> 1:46:25.600
 and devices, the organization. It's not everything. Everything. I mean, to a point where I wonder

1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:35.120
 even if Newton was like, you said 40, but even like 30. So he's very, like if you would be able

1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:42.080
 to catch up with the conception of everything. I wonder as a scientist, how much you load in from

1:46:42.080 --> 1:46:50.400
 age five about this world in order to be able to conceive of the world of ideas that push that

1:46:50.400 --> 1:46:56.480
 science forward. I mean, you mentioned the railroad and all those kinds of things. That might be

1:46:56.480 --> 1:47:02.000
 fundamental to our ability to invent even when it doesn't directly obviously seem relevant.

1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:13.840
 Well, yes. I mean, the railroad, the steam engine, the Watt engine, et cetera. I mean,

1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:19.440
 that was really the Watt engine was developed pretty... Although Watt knew Joseph Black,

1:47:19.440 --> 1:47:25.200
 a chemist scientist and so on, did stuff on heat, was developed pretty much independently of

1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:36.560
 the developing thoughts about heat at the time. But what it's not independent of is the evolution

1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:45.200
 of practice in the manufacture and construction of devices which can do things in extraordinarily

1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:51.600
 novel ways and the premium being gradually placed on calculating how you can make them more

1:47:51.600 --> 1:48:00.320
 efficient. That is of a piece with a way of thinking about the world in which you're controlling

1:48:00.320 --> 1:48:07.040
 things and working it. It's something that humans have been doing for a long time, but in this more

1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:18.160
 concerted and structured way, I think you really don't find it in the fullest sense until well into

1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:28.320
 the 1500s and really not fully until the 17th century later on. So Newton had this year of

1:48:28.320 --> 1:48:34.560
 miracles. I wonder if I could ask you briefly about Einstein and his year of miracles. I've

1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:42.800
 been reading, re reading, revisiting the brilliance of the papers that Einstein published in the year

1:48:42.800 --> 1:48:49.280
 1905, one of which won him the Nobel prize, the photoelectric effect, but also Brownian motion,

1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:56.320
 special theory of relativity, and of course the old E equals MC squared.

1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:05.520
 Does that make sense to you that these two figures had such productive years

1:49:05.520 --> 1:49:12.960
 that there's this moment of genius? Maybe, maybe if we zoom out, I mean, I, my work is very much

1:49:12.960 --> 1:49:19.120
 in artificial intelligence, sort of wondering about the nature of intelligence. Like how did we,

1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:28.400
 how did evolution on earth produce genius that could come up with so much in so little time?

1:49:28.400 --> 1:49:35.040
 To me, that gives me hope that one person can change the world in such a small amount of time.

1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:44.720
 Well, of course there are precedents for, in both Newton's and Einstein's cases for elements of

1:49:44.720 --> 1:49:50.000
 what we're finding there. It's, you know, and so on. Well, I have no idea. You know,

1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:54.880
 I'm sure you must've read, it was a kind of a famous story that after Einstein died,

1:49:54.880 --> 1:50:00.240
 he donated his brain and they sliced it up to see if they could find something unusual there,

1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:10.800
 nothing unusual visibly in there. So I have, clearly there are people who for various reasons,

1:50:11.520 --> 1:50:19.280
 maybe both intrinsic and extrinsic in the sense of experience and so on, are capable of coming

1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:27.280
 up with these extraordinary results. Many years ago, when I was a student, a friend of mine came

1:50:27.280 --> 1:50:31.440
 in and said, did you read about, did you read this? I forget what, anyway, there was a story

1:50:31.440 --> 1:50:43.040
 in the paper. It was about, I think it was a young woman who was, she couldn't speak and she was

1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:53.520
 somewhere on the autism spectrum. She could not read other people's affect in any ways, but she

1:50:53.520 --> 1:51:03.520
 could sit down at a piano and having heard it once and then run variations on the most complex

1:51:05.120 --> 1:51:10.240
 pianistic works of Chopin and others, right? Now how?

1:51:14.480 --> 1:51:21.360
 Some aspect of our mind is able to tune in in some aspect of reality and become a master of it.

1:51:21.360 --> 1:51:25.840
 And every once in a while, that means coming up with breakthrough ideas in physics.

1:51:26.960 --> 1:51:33.520
 Yep. How the heck does that happen? Who knows? Jed, I'd like to say thank you so much for spending

1:51:33.520 --> 1:51:37.680
 your valuable time with me today. It was a really fascinating conversation. I've learned so much

1:51:37.680 --> 1:51:41.760
 about Isaac Newton, who's one of the most fascinating figures in human history. So

1:51:41.760 --> 1:51:44.320
 thank you so much for talking to me. My pleasure. I enjoyed it very much.

1:51:44.320 --> 1:51:51.360
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jed Buchwald. To support this podcast,

1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:56.960
 please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

1:51:56.960 --> 1:52:03.680
 Thomas Kuhn, a philosopher of science. The answers you get depend on the questions you ask.

1:52:03.680 --> 1:52:16.800
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
