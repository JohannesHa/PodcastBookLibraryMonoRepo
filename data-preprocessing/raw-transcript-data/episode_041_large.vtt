00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
 The following is a conversation with Leonard Susskind.

00:03.080 --> 00:04.840
 He's a professor of theoretical physics

00:04.840 --> 00:07.640
 at Stanford University and founding director

00:07.640 --> 00:10.400
 of Stanford Institute of Theoretical Physics.

00:10.400 --> 00:13.040
 He is widely regarded as one of the fathers

00:13.040 --> 00:14.920
 of string theory and in general,

00:14.920 --> 00:17.400
 as one of the greatest physicists of our time,

00:17.400 --> 00:20.400
 both as a researcher and an educator.

00:20.400 --> 00:23.320
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

00:23.320 --> 00:26.120
 Perhaps you noticed that the people I've been speaking with

00:26.120 --> 00:27.880
 are not just computer scientists,

00:27.880 --> 00:30.640
 but philosophers, mathematicians, writers,

00:30.640 --> 00:34.240
 psychologists, physicists, and soon other disciplines.

00:34.240 --> 00:37.400
 To me, AI is much bigger than deep learning,

00:37.400 --> 00:39.000
 bigger than computing.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.880
 It is our civilization's journey

00:40.880 --> 00:42.880
 into understanding the human mind

00:42.880 --> 00:45.880
 and creating echoes of it in the machine.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.800

00:57.600 --> 01:01.640
 And now, here's my conversation with Leonard Susskind.

01:02.760 --> 01:05.360
 You worked and were friends with Richard Feynman.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.640
 How has he influenced you, changed you

01:07.640 --> 01:09.120
 as a physicist and thinker?

01:10.160 --> 01:13.920
 What I saw, I think what I saw was somebody

01:13.920 --> 01:18.600
 who could do physics in this deeply intuitive way.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.080
 His style was almost to close his eyes

01:21.080 --> 01:24.540
 and visualize the phenomena that he was thinking about.

01:24.540 --> 01:29.540
 And through visualization, outflank the mathematical,

01:30.520 --> 01:34.360
 the highly mathematical and very, very sophisticated

01:34.360 --> 01:37.020
 technical arguments that people would use.

01:37.020 --> 01:39.400
 I think that was also natural to me,

01:39.400 --> 01:43.960
 but I saw somebody who was actually successful at it,

01:43.960 --> 01:47.760
 who could do physics in a way that I regarded

01:47.760 --> 01:54.760
 as simpler, more direct, more intuitive.

01:55.520 --> 01:59.080
 And while I don't think he changed my way of thinking,

01:59.080 --> 02:01.480
 I do think he validated it.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.080
 He made me look at it and say, yeah,

02:03.080 --> 02:06.280
 that's something you can do and get away with.

02:06.280 --> 02:08.680
 Practically didn't get away with it.

02:08.680 --> 02:12.000
 So do you find yourself, whether you're thinking

02:12.000 --> 02:14.720
 about quantum mechanics or black holes

02:14.720 --> 02:19.400
 or string theory, using intuition as a first step

02:19.400 --> 02:22.160
 or step throughout using visualization?

02:22.160 --> 02:24.680
 Yeah, very much so, very much so.

02:24.680 --> 02:27.720
 I tend not to think about the equations.

02:27.720 --> 02:30.160
 I tend not to think about the symbols.

02:30.160 --> 02:34.660
 I tend to try to visualize the phenomena themselves.

02:34.660 --> 02:38.400
 And then when I get an insight that I think is valid,

02:38.400 --> 02:40.360
 I might try to convert it to mathematics,

02:40.360 --> 02:44.400
 but I'm not a natural mathematician.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.280
 I'm good enough at it.

02:46.280 --> 02:49.820
 I'm good enough at it, but I'm not a great mathematician.

02:49.820 --> 02:52.440
 So for me, the way of thinking about physics

02:52.440 --> 02:56.660
 is first intuitive, first visualization,

02:57.760 --> 02:59.680
 scribble a few equations maybe,

02:59.680 --> 03:02.980
 but then try to convert it to mathematics.

03:02.980 --> 03:04.800
 Experience is that other people are better

03:04.800 --> 03:06.880
 at converting it to mathematics than I am.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
 And yet you've worked with very counterintuitive ideas.

03:12.000 --> 03:12.840
 No, that's true.

03:12.840 --> 03:13.680
 That's true.

03:13.680 --> 03:15.600
 You can visualize something counterintuitive.

03:15.600 --> 03:16.440
 How do you dare?

03:16.440 --> 03:18.900
 By rewiring your brain in new ways.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.680
 Yeah, quantum mechanics is not intuitive.

03:22.680 --> 03:25.740
 Very little of modern physics is intuitive.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.480
 Intuitive, what does intuitive mean?

03:29.480 --> 03:31.800
 It means the ability to think about it

03:31.800 --> 03:33.720
 with basic classical physics,

03:33.720 --> 03:38.720
 the physics that we evolved with throwing stones,

03:38.720 --> 03:43.360
 or splashing water, whatever it happens to be.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.080
 Quantum physics, general relativity,

03:47.080 --> 03:51.160
 quantum field theory are deeply unintuitive in that way.

03:51.160 --> 03:55.200
 But after time and getting familiar with these things,

03:55.200 --> 03:57.040
 you develop new intuitions.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.520
 I always said you rewire.

03:59.680 --> 04:04.360
 And it's to the point where me and many of my friends,

04:04.360 --> 04:05.680
 I and many of my friends,

04:05.680 --> 04:10.280
 can think more easily quantum mechanically

04:10.280 --> 04:11.520
 than we can classically.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.520
 We've gotten so used to it.

04:13.520 --> 04:17.240
 I mean, yes, our neural wiring in our brain

04:17.240 --> 04:20.400
 is such that we understand rocks and stones and water

04:20.400 --> 04:21.240
 and so on.

04:21.240 --> 04:22.060
 We sort of evolved for that.

04:22.060 --> 04:23.320
 Evolved for it.

04:23.320 --> 04:26.720
 Do you think it's possible to create a wiring

04:26.720 --> 04:31.160
 of neuron like state devices that more naturally

04:31.160 --> 04:35.880
 understand quantum mechanics, understand wave function,

04:35.880 --> 04:38.120
 understand these weird things?

04:38.120 --> 04:39.040
 Well, I'm not sure.

04:39.040 --> 04:42.480
 I think many of us have evolved the ability

04:42.480 --> 04:46.360
 to think quantum mechanically to some extent.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.960
 But that doesn't mean you can think like an electron.

04:50.220 --> 04:53.600
 That doesn't mean another example.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.880
 Forget for a minute quantum mechanics.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.660
 Just visualizing four dimensional space

04:58.660 --> 05:02.080
 or five dimensional space or six dimensional space,

05:02.080 --> 05:05.780
 I think we're fundamentally wired

05:05.780 --> 05:08.240
 to visualize three dimensions.

05:08.240 --> 05:11.960
 I can't even visualize two dimensions or one dimension

05:11.960 --> 05:16.040
 without thinking about it as embedded in three dimensions.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.280
 If I wanna visualize a line,

05:18.280 --> 05:21.820
 I think of the line as being a line in three dimensions.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.580
 Or I think of the line as being a line on a piece of paper

05:25.580 --> 05:28.160
 with a piece of paper being in three dimensions.

05:28.160 --> 05:33.160
 I never seem to be able to, in some abstract and pure way,

05:33.240 --> 05:35.920
 visualize in my head the one dimension,

05:35.920 --> 05:38.840
 the two dimension, the four dimension, the five dimensions.

05:38.840 --> 05:41.400
 And I don't think that's ever gonna happen.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.600
 The reason is I think our neural wiring

05:43.600 --> 05:44.920
 is just set up for that.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.060
 On the other hand, we do learn ways

05:49.060 --> 05:52.600
 to think about five, six, seven dimensions.

05:52.600 --> 05:56.200
 We learn ways, we learn mathematical ways,

05:56.200 --> 05:59.640
 and we learn ways to visualize them, but they're different.

06:00.800 --> 06:04.800
 And so yeah, I think we do rewire ourselves.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.240
 Whether we can ever completely rewire ourselves

06:07.240 --> 06:11.680
 to be completely comfortable with these concepts, I doubt.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.560
 So that it's completely natural.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.080
 To where it's completely natural.

06:15.080 --> 06:18.160
 So I'm sure there's somewhat, you could argue,

06:18.160 --> 06:22.400
 creatures that live in a two dimensional space.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.560
 Yeah, maybe there are.

06:23.560 --> 06:28.560
 And while it's romanticizing the notion of curse,

06:28.640 --> 06:30.040
 we're all living, as far as we know,

06:30.040 --> 06:31.680
 in three dimensional space.

06:31.680 --> 06:35.600
 But how do those creatures imagine 3D space?

06:35.600 --> 06:37.640
 Well, probably the way we imagine 4D,

06:37.640 --> 06:40.480
 by using some mathematics and some equations

06:40.480 --> 06:43.060
 and some tricks.

06:44.440 --> 06:48.380
 Okay, so jumping back to Feynman just for a second.

06:48.380 --> 06:52.700
 He had a little bit of an ego.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.780
 Yes.

06:54.780 --> 06:59.140
 Why, do you think ego is powerful or dangerous in science?

07:00.140 --> 07:02.880
 I think both, both, both.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.500
 I think you have to have both arrogance and humility.

07:06.500 --> 07:10.620
 You have to have the arrogance to say, I can do this.

07:10.620 --> 07:13.620
 Nature is difficult, nature is very, very hard.

07:13.620 --> 07:16.140
 I'm smart enough, I can do it.

07:16.140 --> 07:19.020
 I can win the battle with nature.

07:19.020 --> 07:21.020
 On the other hand, I think you also have to have

07:21.020 --> 07:26.020
 the humility to know that you're very likely

07:26.460 --> 07:29.060
 to be wrong on any given occasion.

07:29.060 --> 07:32.060
 Everything you're thinking could suddenly change.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.500
 Young people can come along and say things

07:35.500 --> 07:38.920
 you won't understand and you'll be lost and flabbergasted.

07:39.820 --> 07:42.620
 So I think it's a combination of both.

07:42.620 --> 07:46.660
 You better recognize that you're very limited,

07:46.660 --> 07:49.280
 and you better be able to say to yourself,

07:49.280 --> 07:52.500
 I'm not so limited that I can't win this battle with nature.

07:53.460 --> 07:56.640
 It takes a special kind of person

07:56.640 --> 07:59.820
 who can manage both of those, I would say.

07:59.820 --> 08:03.020
 And I would say there's echoes of that in your own work,

08:03.020 --> 08:05.900
 a little bit of ego, a little bit of outside of the box,

08:05.900 --> 08:06.860
 humble thinking.

08:08.260 --> 08:09.580
 I hope so.

08:09.580 --> 08:14.580
 So was there a time where you felt,

08:16.500 --> 08:18.080
 you looked at yourself and asked,

08:18.080 --> 08:19.920
 am I completely wrong about this?

08:19.920 --> 08:23.980
 Oh yeah, about the whole thing or about specific things?

08:23.980 --> 08:24.900
 The whole thing.

08:24.900 --> 08:25.900
 What do you mean?

08:25.900 --> 08:27.060
 Wait, which whole thing?

08:27.060 --> 08:29.960
 Me and me and my ability to do this thing.

08:29.960 --> 08:31.420
 Oh, those kinds of doubts.

08:31.420 --> 08:33.840
 First of all, did you have those kinds of doubts?

08:33.840 --> 08:35.940
 No, I had different kind of doubts.

08:35.940 --> 08:37.940
 I came from a very working class background

08:37.940 --> 08:41.100
 and I was uncomfortable in academia for,

08:41.100 --> 08:42.680
 oh, for a long time.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.260
 But they weren't doubts about my ability or my,

08:48.020 --> 08:52.740
 they were just the discomfort in being in an environment

08:52.740 --> 08:56.620
 that my family hadn't participated in,

08:56.620 --> 08:58.320
 I knew nothing about as a young person.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.700
 I didn't learn that there was such a thing called physics

09:00.700 --> 09:02.340
 until I was almost 20 years old.

09:02.340 --> 09:07.340
 Yeah, so I did have certain kind of doubts,

09:09.560 --> 09:11.860
 but not about my ability.

09:11.860 --> 09:14.000
 I don't think I was too worried

09:14.000 --> 09:15.900
 about whether I would succeed or not.

09:18.040 --> 09:21.860
 I never felt this insecurity, am I ever gonna get a job?

09:23.080 --> 09:25.720
 That had never occurred to me that I wouldn't.

09:27.180 --> 09:29.860
 Maybe you could speak a little bit to this sense

09:29.860 --> 09:31.720
 of what is academia.

09:31.720 --> 09:35.100
 Because I too feel a bit uncomfortable in it.

09:37.800 --> 09:40.040
 There's something I can't put quite into words

09:40.040 --> 09:45.040
 what you have that's not, doesn't, if we call it music,

09:45.240 --> 09:48.520
 you play a different kind of music than a lot of academia.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.960
 How have you joined this orchestra?

09:51.960 --> 09:54.480
 How do you think about it?

09:54.480 --> 09:56.080
 I don't know that I thought about it

09:56.080 --> 09:58.240
 as much as I just felt it.

09:58.240 --> 10:02.800
 Thinking is one thing, feeling is another thing.

10:02.800 --> 10:07.100
 I felt like an outsider until a certain age

10:07.100 --> 10:10.740
 when I suddenly found myself the ultimate insider

10:10.740 --> 10:12.080
 in academic physics.

10:14.520 --> 10:19.520
 And that was a sharp transition, and I wasn't a young man.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.280
 I was probably 50 years old.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.960
 So you were never quite, it was a phase transition,

10:24.960 --> 10:27.360
 you were never quite in the middle.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.440
 Yeah, that's right, I wasn't.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.080
 I always felt a little bit of an outsider.

10:32.080 --> 10:34.280
 In the beginning, a lot an outsider.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.440
 My way of thinking was different,

10:40.440 --> 10:43.040
 my approach to mathematics was different,

10:43.040 --> 10:47.160
 but also my social background

10:47.160 --> 10:49.320
 that I came from was different.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.520
 Now these days, half the young people I meet,

10:51.520 --> 10:53.020
 they're parents or professors.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.860
 That was not my case.

10:59.900 --> 11:02.220
 But then all of a sudden, at some point,

11:02.220 --> 11:06.260
 I found myself at very much the center of,

11:06.260 --> 11:07.840
 maybe not the only one at the center,

11:07.840 --> 11:09.860
 but certainly one of the people in the center

11:09.860 --> 11:11.360
 of a certain kind of physics.

11:12.220 --> 11:16.120
 And all that went away, it went away in a flash.

11:17.700 --> 11:21.780
 So maybe a little bit with Feynman,

11:21.780 --> 11:24.500
 but in general, how do you develop ideas?

11:24.500 --> 11:26.100
 Do you work through ideas alone?

11:26.100 --> 11:27.820
 Do you brainstorm with others?

11:27.820 --> 11:30.360
 Oh, both, both, very definitely both.

11:31.400 --> 11:35.580
 The younger time, I spent more time with myself.

11:36.580 --> 11:39.460
 Now, because I'm at Stanford,

11:39.460 --> 11:44.460
 because I have a lot of ex students

11:44.460 --> 11:49.460
 and people who are interested in the same thing I am,

11:50.840 --> 11:54.320
 I spend a good deal of time, almost on a daily basis,

11:54.320 --> 11:57.360
 interacting, brainstorming, as you said.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.400
 It's a very important part.

12:00.400 --> 12:03.720
 I spend less time probably completely self focused

12:03.720 --> 12:07.800
 than with a piece of paper

12:07.800 --> 12:09.640
 and just sitting there staring at it.

12:09.640 --> 12:13.320
 What are your hopes for quantum computers?

12:13.320 --> 12:16.240
 So machines that are based on,

12:16.240 --> 12:21.240
 that have some elements of leverage quantum mechanical ideas.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.840
 Yeah, it's not just leveraging quantum mechanical ideas.

12:24.840 --> 12:29.840
 You can simulate quantum systems on a classical computer.

12:29.840 --> 12:33.200
 Simulate them means solve the Schrodinger equation for them

12:33.200 --> 12:36.640
 or solve the equations of quantum mechanics

12:36.640 --> 12:40.200
 or solve the equations of quantum mechanics

12:40.200 --> 12:43.600
 on a computer, on a classical computer.

12:43.600 --> 12:47.400
 But the classical computer is not doing,

12:47.400 --> 12:49.760
 is not a quantum mechanical system itself.

12:49.760 --> 12:50.640
 Of course it is.

12:50.640 --> 12:52.120
 Everything's made of quantum mechanics,

12:52.120 --> 12:53.280
 but it's not functioning.

12:53.280 --> 12:56.080
 It's not functioning as a quantum system.

12:56.080 --> 12:58.560
 It's just solving equations.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.840
 The quantum computer is truly a quantum system

13:01.840 --> 13:05.000
 which is actually doing the things

13:05.000 --> 13:07.360
 that you're programming it to do.

13:07.360 --> 13:11.200
 You want to program a quantum field theory.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.680
 If you do it in classical physics,

13:13.680 --> 13:17.600
 that program is not actually functioning in the computer

13:17.600 --> 13:18.760
 as a quantum field theory.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.460
 It's just solving some equations.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.720
 Physically, it's not doing the things

13:23.720 --> 13:27.240
 that the quantum system would do.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.400
 The quantum computer is really a quantum mechanical system

13:30.400 --> 13:34.120
 which is actually carrying out the quantum operations.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.320
 You can measure it at the end.

13:36.320 --> 13:40.480
 It intrinsically satisfies the uncertainty principle.

13:40.480 --> 13:44.320
 It is limited in the same way that quantum systems

13:44.320 --> 13:47.440
 are limited by uncertainty and so forth.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.240
 And it really is a quantum system.

13:49.240 --> 13:51.360
 That means that what you're doing

13:51.360 --> 13:53.360
 when you program something for a quantum system

13:53.360 --> 13:56.900
 is you're actually building a real version of the system.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.440
 The limits of a classical computer,

14:00.440 --> 14:02.920
 classical computers are enormously limited

14:02.920 --> 14:07.160
 when it comes to the quantum systems.

14:07.160 --> 14:09.040
 They're enormously limited

14:09.040 --> 14:12.240
 because you've probably heard this before,

14:12.240 --> 14:14.960
 but in order to store the amount of information

14:14.960 --> 14:19.920
 that's in a quantum state of 400 spins,

14:19.920 --> 14:23.040
 that's not very many, 400 I can put in my pocket,

14:23.040 --> 14:25.560
 I can put 400 pennies in my pocket.

14:27.840 --> 14:32.160
 To be able to simulate the quantum state

14:32.160 --> 14:37.160
 of 400 elementary quantum systems, qubits we call them,

14:37.640 --> 14:39.880
 to do that would take more information

14:39.880 --> 14:43.120
 than can possibly be stored in the entire universe

14:43.120 --> 14:46.560
 if it were packed so tightly

14:46.560 --> 14:50.380
 that you couldn't pack any more in.

14:50.380 --> 14:52.240
 400 qubits.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.520
 On the other hand, if your quantum computer

14:54.520 --> 14:56.320
 is composed of 400 qubits,

14:56.320 --> 14:59.420
 it can do everything 400 qubits can do.

14:59.420 --> 15:02.280
 What kind of space, if you just intuitively think

15:02.280 --> 15:06.320
 about the space of algorithms that that unlocks for us,

15:06.320 --> 15:08.480
 so there's a whole complexity theory

15:08.480 --> 15:10.080
 around classical computers,

15:10.080 --> 15:12.440
 measuring the running time of things,

15:12.440 --> 15:14.880
 and P, so on, what kind of algorithms

15:14.880 --> 15:18.360
 just intuitively do you think it unlocks for us?

15:18.360 --> 15:22.080
 Okay, so we know that there are a handful of algorithms

15:22.080 --> 15:25.760
 that can seriously beat classical computers

15:25.760 --> 15:28.200
 and which can have exponentially more power.

15:28.200 --> 15:29.480
 This is a mathematical statement.

15:29.480 --> 15:32.320
 Nobody's exhibited this in the laboratory.

15:32.320 --> 15:33.600
 It's a mathematical statement.

15:33.600 --> 15:37.640
 We know that's true, but it also seems more and more

15:37.640 --> 15:40.320
 that the number of such things is very limited.

15:40.320 --> 15:45.080
 Only very, very special problems

15:45.080 --> 15:48.760
 exhibit that much advantage for a quantum computer,

15:49.600 --> 15:52.120
 of standard problems.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.900
 To my mind, as far as I can tell,

15:53.900 --> 15:55.600
 the great power of quantum computers

15:55.600 --> 15:58.700
 will actually be to simulate quantum systems.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.760
 If you're interested in a certain quantum system

16:02.760 --> 16:05.880
 and it's too hard to simulate classically,

16:07.360 --> 16:09.840
 you simply build a version of the same system.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.100
 You build a version of it.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.040
 You build a model of it

16:12.040 --> 16:14.440
 that's actually functioning as the system.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.880
 You run it, and then you do the same thing

16:16.880 --> 16:18.500
 you would do to the quantum system.

16:18.500 --> 16:21.820
 You make measurements on it, quantum measurements on it.

16:21.820 --> 16:26.140
 The advantage is you can run it much slower.

16:26.140 --> 16:27.540
 You could say, why bother?

16:27.540 --> 16:29.580
 Why not just use the real system?

16:29.580 --> 16:32.340
 Why not just do experiments on the real system?

16:32.340 --> 16:33.900
 Well, real systems are kind of limited.

16:33.900 --> 16:34.780
 You can't change them.

16:34.780 --> 16:36.300
 You can't manipulate them.

16:36.300 --> 16:39.380
 You can't slow them down so that you can poke into them.

16:40.420 --> 16:43.420
 You can't modify them in arbitrary kinds of ways

16:43.420 --> 16:48.420
 to see what would happen if I change the system a little bit.

16:48.420 --> 16:53.420
 I think that quantum computers will be extremely valuable

16:55.500 --> 17:00.500
 in understanding quantum systems.

17:00.940 --> 17:04.340
 At the lowest level of the fundamental laws.

17:04.340 --> 17:06.540
 They're actually satisfying the same laws

17:06.540 --> 17:09.860
 as the systems that they're simulating.

17:09.860 --> 17:13.060
 Okay, so on the one hand, you have things like factoring.

17:13.060 --> 17:17.580
 Factoring is the great thing of quantum computers.

17:17.580 --> 17:20.620
 Factoring large numbers, that doesn't seem that much

17:20.620 --> 17:22.580
 to do with quantum mechanics.

17:22.580 --> 17:27.580
 It seems to be almost a fluke that a quantum computer

17:28.540 --> 17:32.920
 can solve the factoring problem in a short time.

17:34.420 --> 17:38.520
 And those problems seem to be extremely special, rare,

17:38.520 --> 17:40.300
 and it's not clear to me

17:40.300 --> 17:42.740
 that there's gonna be a lot of them.

17:42.740 --> 17:45.180
 On the other hand, there are a lot of quantum systems.

17:45.180 --> 17:47.900
 Chemistry, there's solid state physics,

17:47.900 --> 17:51.020
 there's material science, there's quantum gravity,

17:51.020 --> 17:53.660
 there's all kinds of quantum field theory.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.780
 And some of these are actually turning out

17:56.780 --> 17:58.100
 to be applied sciences,

17:58.100 --> 18:00.140
 as well as very fundamental sciences.

18:01.120 --> 18:05.140
 So we probably will run out of the ability

18:05.140 --> 18:07.960
 to solve equations for these things.

18:07.960 --> 18:11.620
 Solve equations by the standard methods of pencil and paper.

18:11.620 --> 18:15.440
 Solve the equations by the method of classical computers.

18:16.380 --> 18:18.740
 And so what we'll do is we'll build versions

18:18.740 --> 18:22.120
 of these systems, run them,

18:22.120 --> 18:24.280
 and run them under controlled circumstances

18:24.280 --> 18:26.840
 where we can change them, manipulate them,

18:26.840 --> 18:28.100
 make measurements on them,

18:28.100 --> 18:30.540
 and find out all the things we wanna know.

18:30.540 --> 18:33.640
 So in finding out the things we wanna know

18:33.640 --> 18:38.640
 about very small systems, is there something

18:38.640 --> 18:42.080
 that we can also find out about the macro level,

18:42.080 --> 18:45.040
 about something about the function, forgive me,

18:45.040 --> 18:48.080
 of our brain, biological systems,

18:48.080 --> 18:50.380
 the stuff that's about one meter in size

18:50.380 --> 18:53.260
 versus much, much smaller?

18:53.260 --> 18:55.200
 Well, what all the excitement is about

18:55.200 --> 18:56.880
 among the people that I interact with

18:56.880 --> 18:58.960
 is understanding black holes.

18:58.960 --> 18:59.800
 Black holes.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.040
 Black holes are big things.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.100
 They are many, many degrees of freedom.

19:04.100 --> 19:08.740
 There is another kind of quantum system that is big.

19:08.740 --> 19:10.860
 It's a large quantum computer.

19:11.760 --> 19:13.140
 And one of the things we've learned

19:13.140 --> 19:15.700
 is that the physics of large quantum computers

19:15.700 --> 19:17.580
 is in some ways similar to the physics

19:17.580 --> 19:19.740
 of large quantum black holes.

19:19.740 --> 19:22.000
 And we're using that relationship.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.780
 Now you asked, you didn't ask about quantum computers

19:24.780 --> 19:28.100
 or systems, you didn't ask about black holes,

19:28.100 --> 19:29.940
 you asked about brains.

19:29.940 --> 19:32.300
 Yeah, about stuff that's in the middle of the two.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.060
 It's different.

19:34.060 --> 19:36.580
 So black holes are,

19:36.580 --> 19:39.580
 there's something fundamental about black holes

19:39.580 --> 19:42.180
 that feels to be very different than a brain.

19:42.180 --> 19:43.300
 Yes.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.980
 And they also function in a very quantum mechanical way.

19:45.980 --> 19:46.820
 Right.

19:46.820 --> 19:47.820
 Okay.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.620
 It is, first of all, unclear to me,

19:50.620 --> 19:52.140
 but of course it's unclear to me.

19:52.140 --> 19:54.480
 I'm not a neuroscientist.

19:55.340 --> 19:58.100
 I have, I don't even have very many friends

19:58.100 --> 20:00.200
 who are neuroscientists.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.580
 I would like to have more friends who are neuroscientists.

20:02.580 --> 20:04.460
 I just don't run into them very often.

20:05.620 --> 20:07.420
 Among the few neuroscientists

20:07.420 --> 20:09.640
 I've ever talked about about this,

20:09.640 --> 20:12.440
 they are pretty convinced

20:12.440 --> 20:15.720
 that the brain functions classically,

20:16.740 --> 20:20.600
 that it is not intrinsically a quantum mechanical system

20:20.600 --> 20:23.640
 or it doesn't make use of the special features,

20:23.640 --> 20:26.460
 entanglement, coherence, superposition.

20:26.460 --> 20:27.380
 Are they right?

20:27.380 --> 20:28.960
 I don't know.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.340
 I sort of hope they're wrong

20:30.340 --> 20:32.900
 just because I like the romantic idea

20:32.900 --> 20:35.180
 that the brain is a quantum system.

20:35.180 --> 20:37.820
 But I think probably not.

20:38.680 --> 20:40.100
 The other thing,

20:40.100 --> 20:43.020
 big systems can be composed of lots of little systems.

20:44.180 --> 20:47.700
 Materials, the materials that we work with and so forth

20:47.700 --> 20:52.700
 are, can be large systems, a large piece of material,

20:52.880 --> 20:55.140
 but they're made out of quantum systems.

20:55.140 --> 20:57.180
 Now, one of the things that's been happening

20:57.180 --> 21:00.580
 over the last good number of years

21:00.580 --> 21:04.720
 is we're discovering materials and quantum systems,

21:04.720 --> 21:08.220
 which function much more quantum mechanically

21:08.220 --> 21:09.640
 than we imagined.

21:09.640 --> 21:12.020
 Topological insulators, this kind of thing,

21:12.020 --> 21:13.500
 that kind of thing.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.220
 Those are macroscopic systems,

21:15.220 --> 21:17.860
 but they're just superconductors.

21:17.860 --> 21:21.880
 Superconductors have a lot of quantum mechanics in them.

21:22.900 --> 21:25.040
 You can have a large chunk of superconductor.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.780
 So it's a big piece of material.

21:26.780 --> 21:29.640
 On the other hand, it's functioning and its properties

21:29.640 --> 21:32.840
 depend very, very strongly on quantum mechanics.

21:32.840 --> 21:36.200
 And to analyze them, you need the tools of quantum mechanics.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.540
 If we can go on to black holes

21:41.100 --> 21:42.940
 and looking at the universe

21:42.940 --> 21:45.140
 as a information processing system,

21:45.140 --> 21:46.740
 as a computer, as a giant computer.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.560
 It's a giant computer.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.900
 What's the power of thinking of the universe

21:50.900 --> 21:52.340
 as an information processing system?

21:52.340 --> 21:55.160
 Or what is perhaps its use

21:55.160 --> 21:58.740
 besides the mathematical use of discussing black holes

21:59.740 --> 22:02.820
 and your famous debates and ideas around that

22:02.820 --> 22:06.080
 to human beings,

22:06.080 --> 22:08.800
 or life in general as information processing systems?

22:08.800 --> 22:11.500
 Well, all systems are information processing systems.

22:13.300 --> 22:16.740
 You poke them, they change a little bit, they evolve.

22:16.740 --> 22:18.340
 All systems are information processing systems.

22:18.340 --> 22:21.420
 So there's no extra magic to us humans?

22:22.660 --> 22:25.020
 It certainly feels, consciousness intelligence

22:25.020 --> 22:26.060
 feels like magic.

22:26.060 --> 22:26.900
 It sure does.

22:26.900 --> 22:28.200
 Where does it emerge from?

22:29.340 --> 22:31.740
 If we look at information processing,

22:33.620 --> 22:35.100
 what are the emergent phenomena

22:35.100 --> 22:37.500
 that come from viewing the world

22:37.500 --> 22:39.880
 as an information processing system?

22:39.880 --> 22:41.940
 Here is what I think.

22:41.940 --> 22:43.540
 My thoughts are not worth much in this.

22:43.540 --> 22:44.620
 If you ask me about physics,

22:44.620 --> 22:46.660
 my thoughts may be worth something.

22:46.660 --> 22:48.060
 If you ask me about this,

22:48.060 --> 22:50.880
 I'm not sure my thoughts are worth anything.

22:50.880 --> 22:53.280
 But as I said earlier,

22:53.280 --> 22:55.780
 I think when we do introspection,

22:55.780 --> 22:57.500
 when we imagine doing introspection

22:57.500 --> 22:58.980
 and try to figure out what it is

22:58.980 --> 23:00.540
 when we do when we're thinking,

23:00.540 --> 23:03.500
 I think we get it wrong.

23:03.500 --> 23:04.840
 I'm pretty sure we get it wrong.

23:04.840 --> 23:07.260
 Everything I've heard about the way the brain functions

23:07.260 --> 23:08.860
 is so counterintuitive.

23:09.740 --> 23:14.380
 For example, you have neurons which detect vertical lines.

23:14.380 --> 23:15.620
 You have different neurons

23:15.620 --> 23:17.880
 which detect lines at 45 degrees.

23:17.880 --> 23:19.420
 You have different neurons.

23:19.420 --> 23:21.800
 I never imagined that there were whole circuits

23:21.800 --> 23:25.380
 which were devoted to vertical lines in my brain.

23:25.380 --> 23:28.100
 Doesn't seem to be the way my brain works.

23:28.100 --> 23:31.140
 My brain seems to work if I put my finger up vertically

23:31.140 --> 23:32.220
 or if I put it horizontally

23:32.220 --> 23:33.380
 or if I put it this way or that way.

23:33.380 --> 23:36.220
 It seems to me it's the same circuits.

23:36.220 --> 23:37.680
 It's not the way it works.

23:38.860 --> 23:41.460
 The way the brain is compartmentalized

23:41.460 --> 23:43.660
 seems to be very, very different

23:43.660 --> 23:45.580
 than what I would have imagined

23:45.580 --> 23:49.660
 if I were just doing psychological introspection

23:49.660 --> 23:51.940
 about how things work.

23:51.940 --> 23:55.920
 My conclusion is that we won't get it right that way,

23:55.920 --> 23:58.780
 that how will we get it right?

23:59.640 --> 24:03.220
 I think maybe computer scientists will get it right eventually.

24:03.220 --> 24:04.420
 I don't think there are any ways near it.

24:04.420 --> 24:06.680
 I don't even think they're thinking about it,

24:06.680 --> 24:11.440
 but eventually we will build machines perhaps

24:11.440 --> 24:13.380
 which are complicated enough

24:15.040 --> 24:18.340
 and partly engineered, partly evolved,

24:18.340 --> 24:21.060
 maybe evolved by machine learning and so forth.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.500
 This machine learning is very interesting.

24:23.500 --> 24:26.020
 By machine learning, we will evolve systems

24:26.020 --> 24:29.380
 and we may start to discover mechanisms

24:30.320 --> 24:35.340
 that have implications for how we think

24:35.340 --> 24:38.500
 and for what this consciousness thing is all about

24:39.500 --> 24:42.060
 and we'll be able to do experiments on them

24:42.060 --> 24:43.700
 and perhaps answer questions

24:43.700 --> 24:48.700
 that we can't possibly answer by introspection.

24:49.660 --> 24:51.700
 So that's a really interesting point.

24:51.700 --> 24:55.240
 In many cases, if you look at even a string theory,

24:55.240 --> 24:56.780
 when you first think about a system,

24:56.780 --> 24:59.620
 it seems really complicated, like the human brain,

24:59.620 --> 25:01.460
 and through some basic reasoning

25:02.460 --> 25:07.060
 and trying to discover fundamental low level behavior

25:07.060 --> 25:10.140
 of the system, you find out that it's actually much simpler.

25:10.140 --> 25:13.580
 Do you, one, have you, is that generally the process

25:13.580 --> 25:15.580
 and two, do you have that also hope

25:15.580 --> 25:17.920
 for biological systems as well,

25:17.920 --> 25:21.740
 for all the kinds of stuff we're studying at the human level?

25:21.740 --> 25:23.080
 Of course, physics always begins

25:23.080 --> 25:25.500
 by trying to find the simplest version of something

25:25.500 --> 25:26.560
 and analyze it.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.420
 Yeah, I mean, there are lots of examples

25:28.420 --> 25:33.360
 where physics has taken very complicated systems,

25:33.360 --> 25:36.980
 analyzed them and found simplicity in them for sure.

25:36.980 --> 25:39.900
 I said superconductors before, it's an obvious one.

25:39.900 --> 25:42.520
 A superconductor seems like a monstrously complicated thing

25:42.520 --> 25:45.980
 with all sorts of crazy electrical properties,

25:45.980 --> 25:48.380
 magnetic properties and so forth.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.460
 And when it finally is boiled down

25:50.460 --> 25:52.940
 to its simplest elements,

25:52.940 --> 25:56.100
 it's a very simple quantum mechanical phenomenon

25:56.100 --> 25:58.300
 called spontaneous symmetry breaking,

25:59.260 --> 26:04.260
 and which we, in other contexts, we learned about

26:04.820 --> 26:06.760
 and we're very familiar with.

26:06.760 --> 26:10.540
 So yeah, I mean, yes, we do take complicated things,

26:10.540 --> 26:13.740
 make them simple, but what we don't want to do

26:13.740 --> 26:16.540
 is take things which are intrinsically complicated

26:16.540 --> 26:18.420
 and fool ourselves into thinking

26:18.420 --> 26:20.640
 that we can make them simple.

26:20.640 --> 26:22.380
 We don't want to make, I don't know who said this,

26:22.380 --> 26:23.660
 but we don't want to make them simpler

26:23.660 --> 26:26.740
 than they really are, okay?

26:26.740 --> 26:30.820
 Is the brain a thing which ultimately functions

26:30.820 --> 26:35.580
 by some simple rules or is it just complicated?

26:35.580 --> 26:37.780
 In terms of artificial intelligence,

26:37.780 --> 26:40.840
 nobody really knows what are the limits

26:40.840 --> 26:43.020
 of our current approaches, you mentioned machine learning.

26:43.020 --> 26:44.840
 How do we create human level intelligence?

26:44.840 --> 26:48.220
 It seems that there's a lot of very smart physicists

26:48.220 --> 26:51.260
 who perhaps oversimplify the nature of intelligence

26:51.260 --> 26:53.660
 and think of it as information processing,

26:53.660 --> 26:55.180
 and therefore there doesn't seem to be

26:55.180 --> 26:59.100
 any theoretical reason why we can't artificially create

27:00.820 --> 27:02.980
 human level or superhuman level intelligence.

27:02.980 --> 27:04.540
 In fact, the reasoning goes,

27:04.540 --> 27:07.300
 if you create human level intelligence,

27:07.300 --> 27:08.660
 the same approach you just used

27:08.660 --> 27:10.440
 to create human level intelligence

27:10.440 --> 27:13.740
 should allow you to create superhuman level intelligence

27:13.740 --> 27:16.000
 very easily, exponentially.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.960
 So what do you think that way of thinking

27:18.960 --> 27:22.260
 that comes from physicists is all about?

27:22.260 --> 27:24.180
 I wish I knew, but there's a particular reason

27:24.180 --> 27:25.140
 why I wish I knew.

27:27.420 --> 27:29.360
 I have a second job.

27:30.420 --> 27:34.860
 I consult for Google, not for Google, for Google X.

27:34.860 --> 27:37.780
 I am the senior academic advisor

27:39.060 --> 27:42.100
 to a group of machine learning physicists.

27:43.740 --> 27:45.700
 Now that sounds crazy because I know nothing

27:45.700 --> 27:46.700
 about the subject.

27:47.780 --> 27:49.980
 I know very little about the subject.

27:49.980 --> 27:52.180
 On the other hand, I'm good at giving advice,

27:52.180 --> 27:53.660
 so I give them advice on things.

27:53.660 --> 27:56.300
 Anyway, I see these young physicists

27:56.300 --> 27:58.660
 who are approaching the machine learning problem.

27:58.660 --> 28:00.900
 There is a real machine learning problem.

28:00.900 --> 28:03.060
 Namely, why does it work as well as it does?

28:03.060 --> 28:06.300
 Nobody really seems to understand

28:06.300 --> 28:09.460
 why it is capable of doing the kind of generalizations

28:09.460 --> 28:11.640
 that it does and so forth.

28:11.640 --> 28:14.980
 And there are three groups of people

28:14.980 --> 28:17.460
 who have thought about this.

28:17.460 --> 28:19.060
 There are the engineers.

28:19.060 --> 28:21.580
 The engineers are incredibly smart,

28:21.580 --> 28:23.800
 but they tend not to think as hard

28:23.800 --> 28:26.080
 about why the thing is working

28:26.080 --> 28:28.220
 as much as they do how to use it.

28:28.220 --> 28:31.820
 Obviously, they provided a lot of data,

28:31.820 --> 28:34.060
 and it is they who demonstrated

28:34.060 --> 28:35.820
 that machine learning can work much better

28:35.820 --> 28:37.380
 than you have any right to expect.

28:37.380 --> 28:40.180
 The machine learning systems are systems.

28:40.180 --> 28:41.940
 The system's not too different

28:41.940 --> 28:44.900
 than the kind of systems that physicists study.

28:44.900 --> 28:46.740
 There's not all that much difference

28:46.740 --> 28:50.580
 between quantum, in the structure of mathematics,

28:51.540 --> 28:54.480
 physically, yes, but in the structure of mathematics,

28:54.480 --> 28:57.660
 between a tensor network designed

28:57.660 --> 29:01.420
 to describe a quantum system on the one hand

29:01.420 --> 29:05.100
 and the kind of networks that are used in machine learning.

29:05.100 --> 29:08.940
 So there are more and more, I think,

29:08.940 --> 29:10.940
 young physicists are being drawn

29:10.940 --> 29:12.820
 to this field of machine learning,

29:12.820 --> 29:15.100
 some very, very good ones.

29:15.100 --> 29:16.820
 I work with a number of very good ones,

29:16.820 --> 29:20.380
 not on machine learning, but on having lunch.

29:20.380 --> 29:21.300
 On having lunch?

29:21.300 --> 29:22.460
 Right.

29:22.460 --> 29:23.860
 Yeah.

29:23.860 --> 29:27.620
 And I can tell you they are super smart.

29:27.620 --> 29:30.540
 They don't seem to be so arrogant

29:30.540 --> 29:32.020
 about their physics backgrounds

29:32.020 --> 29:35.100
 that they think they can do things that nobody else can do.

29:35.100 --> 29:37.460
 But the physics way of thinking, I think,

29:37.460 --> 29:40.900
 will add great value to,

29:41.780 --> 29:43.980
 or will bring value to the machine learning.

29:43.980 --> 29:45.740
 I believe it will.

29:45.740 --> 29:47.140
 And I think it already has.

29:47.980 --> 29:50.500
 At what time scale do you think

29:50.500 --> 29:53.180
 predicting the future becomes useless

29:53.180 --> 29:55.340
 in your long experience

29:55.340 --> 29:57.680
 and being surprised at new discoveries?

29:57.680 --> 30:02.680
 Well, sometimes a day, sometimes 20 years.

30:03.480 --> 30:05.600
 There are things which I thought

30:07.040 --> 30:09.840
 we were very far from understanding,

30:09.840 --> 30:12.420
 which practically in a snap of the fingers

30:12.420 --> 30:17.420
 or a blink of the eye suddenly became understood,

30:17.440 --> 30:19.100
 completely surprising to me.

30:21.220 --> 30:24.120
 There are other things which I looked at and I said,

30:24.120 --> 30:27.320
 we're not gonna understand these things for 500 years,

30:27.320 --> 30:29.280
 in particular quantum gravity.

30:29.280 --> 30:32.840
 The scale for that was 20 years, 25 years.

30:32.840 --> 30:33.800
 And we understand a lot

30:33.800 --> 30:35.920
 and we don't understand it completely now by any means,

30:35.920 --> 30:40.780
 but I thought it was 500 years to make any progress.

30:40.780 --> 30:42.960
 It turned out to be very, very far from that.

30:42.960 --> 30:45.200
 It turned out to be more like 20 or 25 years

30:45.200 --> 30:48.400
 from the time when I thought it was 500 years.

30:48.400 --> 30:51.940
 So if we may, can we jump around quantum gravity,

30:51.940 --> 30:53.720
 some basic ideas in physics?

30:53.720 --> 30:58.720
 What is the dream of string theory mathematically?

30:59.280 --> 31:00.120
 What is the hope?

31:00.120 --> 31:01.440
 Where does it come from?

31:01.440 --> 31:03.560
 What problem is it trying to solve?

31:03.560 --> 31:05.000
 I don't think the dream of string theory

31:05.000 --> 31:06.540
 is any different than the dream

31:06.540 --> 31:09.560
 of fundamental theoretical physics altogether.

31:09.560 --> 31:12.680
 Understanding a unified theory of everything.

31:12.680 --> 31:15.040
 I don't like thinking of string theory

31:15.040 --> 31:17.320
 as a subject unto itself

31:17.320 --> 31:19.440
 with people called string theorists

31:19.440 --> 31:21.560
 who are the practitioners

31:21.560 --> 31:24.120
 of this thing called string theory.

31:24.120 --> 31:28.160
 I much prefer to think of them as theoretical physicists

31:28.160 --> 31:32.060
 trying to answer deep fundamental questions about nature,

31:32.060 --> 31:33.400
 in particular gravity,

31:33.400 --> 31:35.040
 in particular gravity and its connection

31:35.040 --> 31:36.340
 with quantum mechanics,

31:38.040 --> 31:41.320
 and who at the present time find string theory

31:41.320 --> 31:44.520
 a useful tool rather than saying

31:44.520 --> 31:46.440
 there's a subject called string theorists.

31:46.440 --> 31:48.680
 I don't like being referred to as a string theorist.

31:48.680 --> 31:53.680
 Yes, but as a tool, is it useful to think about our nature

31:54.080 --> 31:57.500
 in multiple dimensions, the strings vibrating?

31:57.500 --> 31:59.040
 I believe it is useful.

31:59.040 --> 32:02.120
 I'll tell you what the main use of it has been up till now.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.920
 Well, it has had a number of main uses.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.360
 Originally, string theory was invented,

32:06.360 --> 32:07.520
 and I know that I was there.

32:07.520 --> 32:08.960
 I was right at the spot

32:08.960 --> 32:13.080
 where it was being invented literally,

32:13.080 --> 32:16.960
 and it was being invented to understand hadrons.

32:16.960 --> 32:19.120
 Hadrons are subnuclear particles,

32:19.120 --> 32:20.920
 protons, neutrons, mesons,

32:21.960 --> 32:26.960
 and at that time, the late 60s, early 70s,

32:28.580 --> 32:30.120
 it was clear from experiment

32:30.120 --> 32:33.680
 that these particles called hadrons could vibrate,

32:33.680 --> 32:36.800
 could rotate, could do all the things

32:36.800 --> 32:39.640
 that a little closed string can do,

32:39.640 --> 32:46.640
 and it was and is a valid and correct theory of these hadrons.

32:47.920 --> 32:52.460
 It's been experimentally tested, and that is a done deal.

32:53.940 --> 32:56.240
 It had a second life as a theory of gravity,

32:56.240 --> 32:58.100
 the same basic mathematics,

32:58.100 --> 33:01.320
 except on a very, very much smaller distance scale.

33:02.360 --> 33:07.360
 The objects of gravitation are 19 orders of magnitude

33:07.360 --> 33:10.080
 or orders of magnitude smaller than a proton,

33:10.080 --> 33:12.000
 but the same mathematics turned up.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.300
 The same mathematics turned up.

33:14.300 --> 33:15.980
 What has been its value?

33:15.980 --> 33:20.720
 Its value is that it's mathematically rigorous in many ways

33:20.720 --> 33:25.720
 and enabled us to find mathematical structures

33:27.040 --> 33:30.120
 which have both quantum mechanics and gravity.

33:30.120 --> 33:34.080
 With rigor, we can test out ideas.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.160
 We can test out ideas.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.240
 We can't test them in the laboratory.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.840
 They're 19 orders of magnitude too small

33:39.840 --> 33:41.280
 are things that we're interested in,

33:41.280 --> 33:43.160
 but we can test them out mathematically

33:43.160 --> 33:46.860
 and analyze their internal consistency.

33:47.800 --> 33:52.800
 By now, 40 years ago, 35 years ago, and so forth,

33:53.720 --> 33:57.120
 people very, very much questioned the consistency

33:57.120 --> 33:59.240
 between gravity and quantum mechanics.

33:59.240 --> 34:02.840
 Stephen Hawking was very famous for it, rightly so.

34:02.840 --> 34:05.840
 Now, nobody questions that consistency anymore.

34:05.840 --> 34:09.240
 They don't because we have mathematically precise

34:09.240 --> 34:12.680
 string theories which contain both gravity

34:12.680 --> 34:15.760
 and quantum mechanics in a consistent way.

34:15.760 --> 34:20.760
 So it's provided that certainty that quantum mechanics

34:21.280 --> 34:22.840
 and gravity can coexist.

34:22.840 --> 34:24.160
 That's not a small thing.

34:24.160 --> 34:25.000
 It's a very big thing.

34:25.000 --> 34:25.840
 It's a huge thing.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.240
 Einstein would be proud.

34:27.240 --> 34:28.800
 Einstein, he might be appalled.

34:28.800 --> 34:29.640
 I don't know.

34:29.640 --> 34:30.460
 He didn't like it.

34:30.460 --> 34:31.300
 He didn't like it.

34:31.300 --> 34:32.920
 He might not be appalled, I don't know.

34:32.920 --> 34:34.560
 He didn't like quantum mechanics very much,

34:34.560 --> 34:36.360
 but he would certainly be struck by it.

34:37.680 --> 34:40.060
 I think that may be, at this time,

34:40.060 --> 34:42.000
 its biggest contribution to physics

34:42.000 --> 34:45.360
 in illustrating almost definitively

34:45.360 --> 34:46.800
 that quantum mechanics and gravity

34:46.800 --> 34:48.640
 are very closely related

34:48.640 --> 34:51.000
 and not inconsistent with each other.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.840
 Is there a possibility of something deeper,

34:53.840 --> 34:58.840
 more profound that still is consistent with string theory

34:58.840 --> 35:03.120
 but is deeper, that is to be found?

35:03.120 --> 35:04.900
 Well, you could ask the same thing about quantum mechanics.

35:04.900 --> 35:05.740
 Is there something?

35:05.740 --> 35:06.560
 Exactly.

35:06.560 --> 35:07.400
 Yeah, yeah.

35:07.400 --> 35:09.060
 I think string theory is just an example

35:09.060 --> 35:11.000
 of a quantum mechanical system

35:11.000 --> 35:15.660
 that contains both gravitation and quantum mechanics.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.760
 So is there something underlying quantum mechanics?

35:19.760 --> 35:21.560
 Perhaps something deterministic.

35:21.560 --> 35:23.920
 Perhaps something deterministic.

35:23.920 --> 35:27.360
 My friend, Ferad Etouf, whose name you may know,

35:27.360 --> 35:29.600
 he's a very famous physicist.

35:29.600 --> 35:32.240
 Dutch, not as famous as he should be, but...

35:33.820 --> 35:35.160
 Hard to spell his name.

35:35.160 --> 35:36.280
 It's hard to say his name.

35:36.280 --> 35:37.520
 No, it's easy to spell his name.

35:37.520 --> 35:39.240
 Apostrophe, he's the only person I know

35:39.240 --> 35:41.080
 whose name begins with an apostrophe.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.280
 And he's one of my heroes in physics.

35:44.280 --> 35:45.160
 He's a little younger than me,

35:45.160 --> 35:47.640
 but he's nevertheless one of my heroes.

35:47.640 --> 35:52.640
 Etouf believes that there is some substructure to the world

35:52.640 --> 35:55.640
 which is classical in character,

35:55.640 --> 35:58.040
 deterministic in character,

35:58.040 --> 36:00.520
 which somehow by some mechanism

36:00.520 --> 36:03.840
 that he has a hard time spelling out

36:03.840 --> 36:05.880
 emerges as quantum mechanics.

36:07.400 --> 36:08.240
 I don't.

36:08.240 --> 36:10.680
 The wave function is somehow emergent.

36:10.680 --> 36:13.080
 The wave function, not just the wave function,

36:13.080 --> 36:16.760
 but the whole thing that goes with quantum mechanics,

36:16.760 --> 36:19.760
 uncertainty, entanglement, all these things,

36:19.760 --> 36:22.680
 are emergent. So you think quantum mechanics

36:22.680 --> 36:23.800
 is the bottom of the well?

36:23.800 --> 36:25.600
 Is the...

36:25.600 --> 36:30.120
 Here I think is where you have to be humble.

36:30.120 --> 36:31.440
 Here's where humility comes.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.440
 I don't think anybody should say anything

36:33.440 --> 36:36.360
 is the bottom of the well at this time.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.240
 I think we can reasonably say,

36:40.960 --> 36:44.200
 I can reasonably say when I look into the well,

36:44.200 --> 36:47.240
 I can't see past quantum mechanics.

36:47.240 --> 36:50.480
 I can't see past quantum mechanics.

36:50.480 --> 36:52.800
 I don't see any reason for there to be anything

36:52.800 --> 36:55.040
 beyond quantum mechanics.

36:55.040 --> 36:58.200
 I think Etouf has asked very interesting

36:58.200 --> 36:59.240
 and deep questions.

36:59.240 --> 37:00.780
 I don't like his answers.

37:01.960 --> 37:03.720
 Well, again, let me ask,

37:03.720 --> 37:06.560
 if we look at the deepest nature of reality

37:06.560 --> 37:08.320
 with whether it's deterministic

37:09.320 --> 37:13.080
 or when observed as probabilistic,

37:13.080 --> 37:16.960
 what does that mean for our human level

37:16.960 --> 37:18.320
 of ideas of free will?

37:18.320 --> 37:21.560
 Is there any connection whatsoever

37:21.560 --> 37:24.700
 from this perception, perhaps illusion of free will

37:24.700 --> 37:27.760
 that we have and the fundamental nature of reality?

37:27.760 --> 37:31.400
 The only thing I can say is I am puzzled by that

37:31.400 --> 37:32.680
 as much as you are.

37:32.680 --> 37:33.520
 The illusion of it.

37:33.520 --> 37:36.080
 The illusion of consciousness,

37:36.080 --> 37:39.980
 the illusion of free will, the illusion of self.

37:39.980 --> 37:43.380
 Does that connect to?

37:43.380 --> 37:45.380
 How can a physical system do that?

37:45.380 --> 37:48.820
 And I am as puzzled as anybody.

37:48.820 --> 37:51.980
 There's echoes of it in the observer effect.

37:51.980 --> 37:55.340
 So do you understand what it means to be an observer?

37:55.340 --> 37:57.700
 I understand it at a technical level.

37:57.700 --> 38:00.480
 An observer is a system with enough degrees of freedom

38:00.480 --> 38:02.280
 that it can record information

38:02.280 --> 38:03.980
 and which can become entangled

38:03.980 --> 38:05.740
 with the thing that it's measuring.

38:05.740 --> 38:07.300
 Entanglement is the key.

38:07.300 --> 38:12.020
 When a system which we call an apparatus or an observer,

38:12.020 --> 38:15.180
 same thing, interacts with the system

38:15.180 --> 38:19.100
 that it's observing, it doesn't just look at it.

38:19.100 --> 38:21.540
 It becomes physically entangled with it.

38:21.540 --> 38:24.460
 And it's that entanglement which we call an observation

38:24.460 --> 38:26.480
 or a measurement.

38:26.480 --> 38:29.980
 Now, does that satisfy me personally as an observer?

38:32.520 --> 38:33.360
 Yes and no.

38:33.360 --> 38:34.300
 I find it very satisfying

38:34.300 --> 38:36.680
 that we have a mathematical representation

38:36.680 --> 38:40.340
 of what it means to observe a system.

38:40.340 --> 38:44.300
 You are observing stuff right now, the conscious level.

38:44.300 --> 38:48.100
 Do you think there's echoes of that kind of entanglement

38:48.100 --> 38:49.420
 in our macro scale?

38:49.420 --> 38:52.200
 Yes, absolutely, for sure.

38:52.200 --> 38:53.780
 We're entangled with,

38:53.780 --> 38:56.740
 quantum mechanically entangled with everything in this room.

38:56.740 --> 38:59.860
 If we weren't, then it would just,

38:59.860 --> 39:01.760
 well, we wouldn't be observing it.

39:03.140 --> 39:05.620
 But on the other hand, you can ask,

39:05.620 --> 39:10.260
 do I really, am I really comfortable with it?

39:10.260 --> 39:12.540
 And I'm uncomfortable with it in the same way

39:12.540 --> 39:15.300
 that I can never get comfortable with five dimensions.

39:15.300 --> 39:17.500
 My brain isn't wired for it.

39:18.860 --> 39:21.380
 Are you comfortable with four dimensions?

39:21.380 --> 39:22.620
 A little bit more,

39:22.620 --> 39:26.340
 because I can always imagine the fourth dimension is time.

39:26.340 --> 39:29.980
 So the arrow of time, are you comfortable with that arrow?

39:29.980 --> 39:31.980
 Do you think time is an emergent phenomena

39:31.980 --> 39:33.680
 or is it fundamental to nature?

39:33.680 --> 39:37.560
 That is a big question in physics right now.

39:37.560 --> 39:39.160
 All the physics that we do,

39:40.160 --> 39:42.800
 or at least that the people that I am comfortable

39:42.800 --> 39:47.800
 with talking to, my friends, my friends.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.880
 No, we all ask the same question that you just asked.

39:51.880 --> 39:55.240
 Space, we have a pretty good idea is emergent

39:55.240 --> 40:00.240
 and it emerges out of entanglement and other things.

40:00.240 --> 40:03.920
 Time always seems to be built into our equations

40:03.920 --> 40:06.680
 as just what Newton pretty much would have thought.

40:06.680 --> 40:09.140
 Newton, modified a little bit by Einstein,

40:09.140 --> 40:10.380
 would have called time.

40:12.000 --> 40:17.000
 And mostly in our equations, it is not emergent.

40:19.200 --> 40:21.560
 Time in physics is completely symmetric,

40:21.560 --> 40:22.400
 forward and backward.

40:22.400 --> 40:23.400
 Right, it's symmetric.

40:23.400 --> 40:27.300
 So you don't really need to think about the arrow of time

40:27.300 --> 40:29.240
 for most physical phenomena.

40:29.240 --> 40:33.400
 For most microscopic phenomena, no.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.640
 It's only when the phenomena involve systems

40:35.640 --> 40:38.960
 which are big enough for thermodynamics to become important,

40:38.960 --> 40:41.680
 for entropy to become important.

40:41.680 --> 40:46.020
 For a small system, entropy is not a good concept.

40:47.960 --> 40:52.840
 Entropy is something which emerges out of large numbers.

40:52.840 --> 40:56.600
 It's a probabilistic idea or it's a statistical idea

40:56.600 --> 40:58.500
 and it's a thermodynamic idea.

40:58.500 --> 41:00.840
 Thermodynamics requires lots and lots

41:00.840 --> 41:04.120
 and lots of little substructures, okay?

41:04.120 --> 41:09.120
 So it's not until you emerge at the thermodynamic level

41:09.680 --> 41:11.720
 that there's an arrow of time.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.560
 Do we understand it?

41:13.560 --> 41:15.800
 Yeah, I think we understand better

41:15.800 --> 41:17.160
 than most people think they have.

41:17.160 --> 41:19.360
 Most people say they think we understand it.

41:19.360 --> 41:21.280
 Yeah, I think we understand it.

41:21.280 --> 41:23.900
 It's a statistical idea.

41:23.900 --> 41:26.400
 You mean like second law of thermodynamics,

41:26.400 --> 41:27.240
 entropy and so on?

41:27.240 --> 41:29.720
 Yeah, take a pack of cards and you fling it in the air

41:29.720 --> 41:32.480
 and you look what happens to it, it gets random.

41:32.480 --> 41:33.400
 We understand it.

41:33.400 --> 41:36.200
 It doesn't go from random to simple.

41:36.200 --> 41:37.720
 It goes from simple to random.

41:38.600 --> 41:41.820
 But do you think it ever breaks down?

41:41.820 --> 41:46.180
 What I think you can do is in a laboratory setting,

41:46.180 --> 41:49.020
 you can take a system which is somewhere intermediate

41:49.020 --> 41:51.160
 between being small and being large

41:53.080 --> 41:56.080
 and make it go backward.

41:56.080 --> 41:59.560
 A thing which looks like it only wants to go forward

41:59.560 --> 42:01.640
 because of statistical mechanical reasons,

42:01.640 --> 42:03.920
 because of the second law,

42:03.920 --> 42:07.120
 you can very, very carefully manipulate it

42:07.120 --> 42:09.100
 to make it run backward.

42:09.100 --> 42:11.400
 I don't think you can take an egg, a Humpty Dumpty

42:11.400 --> 42:15.000
 who fell on the floor and reverse that.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.480
 But you can, in a very controlled situation,

42:18.480 --> 42:22.760
 you can take systems which appear to be evolving

42:22.760 --> 42:25.360
 statistically toward randomness,

42:25.360 --> 42:29.280
 stop them, reverse them, and make them go back.

42:29.280 --> 42:30.800
 What's the intuition behind that?

42:30.800 --> 42:31.940
 How do we do that?

42:31.940 --> 42:33.520
 How do we reverse it?

42:33.520 --> 42:35.600
 You're saying a closed system.

42:35.600 --> 42:38.320
 Yeah, pretty much closed system, yes.

42:38.320 --> 42:41.600
 Did you just say that time travel is possible?

42:41.600 --> 42:44.080
 No, I didn't say time travel is possible.

42:44.080 --> 42:45.960
 I said you can make a system go backward.

42:45.960 --> 42:46.800
 In time.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.040
 You can make it go back.

42:48.040 --> 42:49.520
 You can make it reverse its steps.

42:49.520 --> 42:51.520
 You can make it reverse its trajectory.

42:51.520 --> 42:52.400
 Yeah.

42:52.400 --> 42:53.240
 How do we do it?

42:53.240 --> 42:54.640
 What's the intuition there?

42:54.640 --> 42:58.720
 Does it have, is it just a fluke thing

42:58.720 --> 43:00.840
 that we can do at a small scale in the lab

43:00.840 --> 43:01.680
 that doesn't have?

43:01.680 --> 43:02.840
 Well, what I'm saying is you can do it

43:02.840 --> 43:05.260
 a little bit better than a small scale.

43:05.260 --> 43:10.260
 You can certainly do it with a simple, small system.

43:10.480 --> 43:14.240
 Small systems don't have any sense of the arrow of time.

43:14.240 --> 43:19.240
 Atoms, atoms are no sense of an arrow of time.

43:20.580 --> 43:22.380
 They're completely reversible.

43:22.380 --> 43:24.440
 It's only when you have, you know,

43:24.440 --> 43:25.880
 the second law of thermodynamics

43:25.880 --> 43:28.480
 is the law of large numbers.

43:28.480 --> 43:30.800
 So you can break the law because it's not

43:30.800 --> 43:31.640
 a deterministic law. You can break it,

43:31.640 --> 43:33.880
 you can break it, but it's hard.

43:33.880 --> 43:36.080
 It requires great care.

43:36.080 --> 43:38.480
 The bigger the system is, the more care,

43:38.480 --> 43:40.760
 the more, the harder it is.

43:40.760 --> 43:43.880
 You have to overcome what's called chaos.

43:43.880 --> 43:45.600
 And that's hard.

43:45.600 --> 43:47.660
 And it requires more and more precision.

43:47.660 --> 43:50.080
 For 10 particles, you might be able to do it

43:50.080 --> 43:54.000
 with some effort.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.760
 For a hundred particles, it's really hard.

43:56.760 --> 43:59.340
 For a thousand or a million particles, forget it,

43:59.340 --> 44:01.220
 but not for any fundamental reason,

44:01.220 --> 44:03.720
 just because it's technologically too hard

44:03.720 --> 44:05.660
 to make the system go backward.

44:08.320 --> 44:13.320
 So, no time travel for engineering reasons.

44:13.440 --> 44:15.280
 Oh, no, no, no, no.

44:15.280 --> 44:16.880
 What is time travel?

44:16.880 --> 44:19.280
 Time travel to the future?

44:19.280 --> 44:20.400
 That's easy.

44:20.400 --> 44:22.400
 You just close your eyes, go to sleep,

44:22.400 --> 44:23.480
 and you wake up in the future.

44:23.480 --> 44:25.960
 Yeah, yeah, a good nap gets you there, yeah.

44:25.960 --> 44:27.400
 A good nap gets you there, right.

44:27.400 --> 44:32.280
 But reversing the second law of thermodynamics,

44:32.280 --> 44:36.760
 going backward in time for anything that's human scale

44:36.760 --> 44:40.000
 is a very difficult engineering effort.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.440
 I wouldn't call that time travel

44:41.440 --> 44:43.040
 because it gets too mixed up

44:43.040 --> 44:46.040
 with what science fiction calls time travel.

44:46.040 --> 44:51.040
 This is just the ability to reverse a system.

44:51.040 --> 44:55.680
 You take the system and you reverse the direction

44:55.680 --> 44:58.280
 of motion of every molecule in it.

44:58.280 --> 45:00.940
 That, you can do it with one molecule.

45:00.940 --> 45:03.500
 If you find a particle moving in a certain direction,

45:03.500 --> 45:05.740
 let's not say a particle, a baseball,

45:06.700 --> 45:10.960
 you stop it dead and then you simply reverse its motion.

45:10.960 --> 45:12.840
 In principle, that's not too hard.

45:12.840 --> 45:15.240
 And it'll go back along its trajectory

45:15.240 --> 45:16.440
 in the backward direction.

45:16.440 --> 45:18.200
 Just running the program backwards.

45:18.200 --> 45:19.480
 Running the program backward.

45:19.480 --> 45:20.460
 Yeah. Okay.

45:20.460 --> 45:22.400
 If you have two baseballs colliding,

45:22.400 --> 45:23.520
 well, you can do it,

45:23.520 --> 45:26.920
 but you have to be very, very careful to get it just right.

45:28.760 --> 45:32.400
 If you have 10 baseballs, really, really, better yet,

45:32.400 --> 45:36.200
 10 billiard balls on an idealized,

45:36.200 --> 45:37.820
 frictionless billiard table.

45:38.840 --> 45:41.800
 Okay, so you start the balls all on a triangle, right?

45:41.800 --> 45:43.440
 And you whack them.

45:43.440 --> 45:44.640
 Depending on the game you're playing,

45:44.640 --> 45:46.000
 you either whack them or you're really careful,

45:46.000 --> 45:48.280
 but you whack them.

45:48.280 --> 45:51.520
 And they go flying off in all possible directions.

45:51.520 --> 45:53.140
 Okay, try to reverse that.

45:54.720 --> 45:55.680
 Try to reverse that.

45:55.680 --> 45:57.680
 Imagine trying to take every billiard ball,

45:57.680 --> 46:00.320
 stopping it dead at some point,

46:00.320 --> 46:01.680
 and reversing its motion

46:01.680 --> 46:04.200
 so that it was going in the opposite direction.

46:04.200 --> 46:07.340
 If you did that with tremendous care,

46:07.340 --> 46:11.500
 it would reassemble itself back into the triangle.

46:11.500 --> 46:14.520
 Okay, that is a fact.

46:14.520 --> 46:16.860
 And you can probably do it with two billiard balls,

46:16.860 --> 46:19.920
 maybe with three billiard balls if you're really lucky.

46:19.920 --> 46:21.840
 But what happens is as the system

46:21.840 --> 46:23.160
 gets more and more complicated,

46:23.160 --> 46:26.120
 you have to be more and more precise

46:26.120 --> 46:27.880
 not to make the tiniest error,

46:27.880 --> 46:30.960
 because the tiniest errors will get magnified

46:30.960 --> 46:33.920
 and you'll simply not be able to do the reversal.

46:34.920 --> 46:38.560
 So yeah, but I wouldn't call that time travel.

46:38.560 --> 46:39.680
 Yeah, that's something else.

46:39.680 --> 46:43.240
 But if you think of it, it just made me think,

46:43.240 --> 46:46.980
 if you think the unrolling of state

46:46.980 --> 46:49.840
 that's happening as a program,

46:49.840 --> 46:52.860
 if we look at the world,

46:52.860 --> 46:56.440
 silly idea of looking at the world as a simulation,

46:56.440 --> 46:57.360
 as a computer.

46:59.080 --> 47:01.920
 But it's not a computer, it's just a single program.

47:03.200 --> 47:06.320
 A question arises that might be useful.

47:06.320 --> 47:11.320
 How hard is it to have a computer that runs the universe?

47:11.320 --> 47:16.320
 Okay, so there are mathematical universes

47:18.300 --> 47:20.040
 that we know about.

47:20.040 --> 47:22.840
 One of them is called anti de Sitter space,

47:22.840 --> 47:27.840
 where we, and it's quantum mechanics,

47:28.520 --> 47:32.240
 I think we could simulate it in a computer,

47:32.240 --> 47:34.140
 in a quantum computer.

47:34.140 --> 47:36.600
 Classical computer, all you can do is solve its equations.

47:36.600 --> 47:39.160
 You can't make it work like the real system.

47:39.160 --> 47:41.600
 If we could build a quantum computer, a big enough one,

47:41.600 --> 47:46.600
 a robust enough one, we could probably simulate a universe,

47:49.880 --> 47:52.880
 a small version of an anti de Sitter universe.

47:52.880 --> 47:55.800
 Anti de Sitter is a kind of cosmology.

47:57.680 --> 48:00.100
 So I think we know how to do that.

48:00.100 --> 48:02.340
 The trouble is the universe that we live in

48:02.340 --> 48:04.840
 is not the anti de Sitter geometry,

48:04.840 --> 48:07.320
 it's the de Sitter geometry.

48:07.320 --> 48:11.120
 And we don't really understand its quantum mechanics at all.

48:11.120 --> 48:12.120
 So at the present time,

48:12.120 --> 48:14.000
 I would say we wouldn't have the vaguest idea

48:14.000 --> 48:16.540
 how to simulate a universe similar to our own.

48:18.020 --> 48:21.120
 No, we can ask, could we build in the laboratory

48:21.120 --> 48:26.120
 a small version, a quantum mechanical version,

48:27.720 --> 48:29.620
 the collection of quantum computers

48:29.620 --> 48:32.880
 and tangled and coupled together,

48:32.880 --> 48:37.880
 which would reproduce the phenomena that go on in the universe,

48:38.120 --> 48:40.400
 even on a small scale.

48:40.400 --> 48:43.060
 Yes, if it were anti de Sitter space,

48:43.060 --> 48:44.680
 no, if it's de Sitter space.

48:44.680 --> 48:47.400
 Can you slightly describe de Sitter space

48:47.400 --> 48:48.640
 and anti de Sitter space?

48:48.640 --> 48:49.860
 Yeah.

48:49.860 --> 48:51.400
 What are the geometric properties of?

48:51.400 --> 48:54.860
 They differ by the sign of a single constant

48:54.860 --> 48:56.660
 called the cosmological constant.

48:57.960 --> 49:01.760
 One of them is negatively curved,

49:01.760 --> 49:03.680
 the other is positively curved.

49:04.840 --> 49:08.260
 Anti de Sitter space, which is the negatively curved one,

49:08.260 --> 49:11.360
 you can think of as an isolated system

49:11.360 --> 49:14.620
 in a box with reflecting walls.

49:14.620 --> 49:16.200
 You could think of it as a system

49:16.200 --> 49:19.240
 of quantum mechanical system isolated

49:19.240 --> 49:21.800
 in an isolated environment.

49:21.800 --> 49:23.740
 De Sitter space is the one we really live in.

49:23.740 --> 49:26.880
 And that's the one that's exponentially expanding,

49:26.880 --> 49:30.040
 exponential expansion, dark energy,

49:30.040 --> 49:31.520
 whatever we wanna call it.

49:31.520 --> 49:34.300
 And we don't understand that mathematically.

49:35.880 --> 49:36.960
 Do we understand?

49:36.960 --> 49:38.200
 Not everybody would agree with me,

49:38.200 --> 49:39.560
 but I don't understand.

49:39.560 --> 49:40.600
 They would agree with me,

49:40.600 --> 49:41.920
 they definitely would agree with me

49:41.920 --> 49:43.300
 that I don't understand it.

49:44.720 --> 49:48.480
 What about, is there an understanding of the birth,

49:48.480 --> 49:50.320
 the origin, the big bang?

49:50.320 --> 49:51.800
 So there's one problem with the other.

49:51.800 --> 49:53.160
 No, no, there's theories.

49:53.160 --> 49:54.160
 There are theories.

49:55.840 --> 49:58.980
 My favorite is the one called eternal inflation.

49:58.980 --> 50:00.680
 The infinity can be on both sides,

50:00.680 --> 50:02.600
 on one of the sides and none of the sides.

50:02.600 --> 50:05.520
 So what's eternal infinity?

50:05.520 --> 50:06.360
 Okay.

50:09.480 --> 50:11.120
 Infinity on both sides.

50:13.040 --> 50:13.920
 Oh boy.

50:13.920 --> 50:15.480
 Yeah, yeah, that's.

50:15.480 --> 50:16.520
 Why is that your favorite?

50:16.520 --> 50:21.520
 Because it's the most just mind blowing?

50:21.520 --> 50:22.360
 No.

50:22.360 --> 50:23.200
 Because we want a beginning.

50:23.200 --> 50:24.980
 No, why do we want a beginning?

50:26.800 --> 50:28.380
 In practice there was a beginning, of course.

50:28.380 --> 50:31.280
 In practice there was a beginning.

50:31.280 --> 50:36.280
 But could it have been a random fluctuation

50:36.800 --> 50:39.320
 in an otherwise infinite time?

50:39.320 --> 50:40.160
 Maybe.

50:41.320 --> 50:45.840
 In any case, the eternal inflation theory,

50:45.840 --> 50:47.280
 I think if correctly understood,

50:47.280 --> 50:49.220
 would be infinite in both directions.

50:50.680 --> 50:52.840
 How do you think about infinity?

50:52.840 --> 50:53.960
 Oh God.

50:53.960 --> 50:57.520
 So, okay, of course you can think about it mathematically.

50:57.520 --> 51:01.480
 I just finished this discussion with my friend Sergei Brin.

51:01.480 --> 51:02.800
 How do you think about infinity?

51:02.800 --> 51:05.280
 I say, well, Sergei Brin is infinitely rich.

51:07.960 --> 51:09.360
 How do you test that hypothesis?

51:09.360 --> 51:10.200
 Okay.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.240
 Such a good line.

51:13.240 --> 51:14.080
 Right.

51:15.400 --> 51:17.160
 Yeah, so there's really no way

51:17.160 --> 51:18.800
 to visualize some of these things.

51:20.240 --> 51:22.360
 Yeah, no, this is a very good question.

51:22.360 --> 51:24.680
 Does physics have any,

51:24.680 --> 51:27.360
 does infinity have any place in physics?

51:27.360 --> 51:28.200
 Right.

51:28.200 --> 51:32.600
 Right, and all I can say is very good question.

51:35.840 --> 51:39.400
 So what do you think of the recent first image

51:39.400 --> 51:43.040
 of a black hole visualized from the Horizon Telescope?

51:43.040 --> 51:45.680
 It's an incredible triumph of science.

51:45.680 --> 51:47.740
 In itself, the fact that there are black holes

51:47.740 --> 51:50.620
 which collide is not a surprise.

51:50.620 --> 51:52.640
 And they seem to work exactly

51:52.640 --> 51:54.760
 the way they're supposed to work.

51:54.760 --> 51:57.040
 Will we learn a great deal from it?

51:57.040 --> 52:00.160
 I don't know, we might.

52:00.160 --> 52:01.300
 But the kind of things we'll learn

52:01.300 --> 52:03.280
 won't really be about black holes.

52:05.240 --> 52:09.500
 Why there are black holes in nature

52:09.500 --> 52:12.780
 of that particular mass scale and why they're so common

52:12.780 --> 52:15.680
 may tell us something about the structure,

52:15.680 --> 52:18.440
 evolution of structure in the universe.

52:18.440 --> 52:19.520
 But I don't think it's gonna tell us

52:19.520 --> 52:22.000
 anything new about black holes.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.620
 But it's a triumph in the sense

52:23.620 --> 52:25.420
 that you go back 100 years

52:25.420 --> 52:28.200
 and it was a continuous development,

52:28.200 --> 52:31.480
 general relativity, the discovery of black holes,

52:31.480 --> 52:35.500
 LIGO, the incredible technology that went into LIGO.

52:37.600 --> 52:42.600
 It is something that I never would have believed

52:43.120 --> 52:47.760
 was gonna happen 30, 40 years ago.

52:47.760 --> 52:51.840
 And I think it's a magnificent structure,

52:51.840 --> 52:56.840
 magnificent thing, this evolution of general relativity,

52:59.680 --> 53:03.980
 LIGO, high precision, ability to measure things

53:03.980 --> 53:06.300
 on a scale of 10 to the minus 21.

53:07.680 --> 53:09.400
 So, astonishing.

53:09.400 --> 53:12.800
 So you're just in awe that this path

53:12.800 --> 53:14.780
 took us to this picture.

53:14.780 --> 53:15.840
 Is it different?

53:17.480 --> 53:19.840
 You've thought a lot about black holes.

53:19.840 --> 53:22.380
 How did you visualize them in your mind?

53:23.560 --> 53:26.240
 And is the picture different than you've visualized it?

53:26.240 --> 53:28.700
 No, it's simply confirmed.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.720
 It's a magnificent triumph to have confirmed

53:32.720 --> 53:37.320
 a direct observation that Einstein's theory of gravity

53:37.320 --> 53:41.440
 at the level of black hole collisions actually works

53:42.380 --> 53:45.600
 is awesome, it is really awesome.

53:45.600 --> 53:48.160
 I know some of the people who are involved in that.

53:48.160 --> 53:49.960
 They're just ordinary people.

53:49.960 --> 53:54.440
 And the idea that they could carry this out,

53:54.440 --> 53:56.460
 I just, I'm shocked.

53:56.460 --> 53:59.360
 Yeah, just these little homo sapiens?

53:59.360 --> 54:00.960
 Yeah, just these little monkeys.

54:00.960 --> 54:04.800
 Yeah, got together and took a picture of...

54:04.800 --> 54:06.680
 Slightly advanced limer's, I think.

54:08.540 --> 54:11.320
 What kind of questions can science not currently answer

54:11.320 --> 54:13.460
 but you hope might be able to soon?

54:13.460 --> 54:15.080
 Well, you've already addressed them.

54:15.080 --> 54:17.020
 What is consciousness, for example?

54:17.020 --> 54:19.400
 You think that's within the reach of science?

54:19.400 --> 54:21.640
 I think it's somewhat within the reach of science,

54:21.640 --> 54:23.680
 but I think that now I think it's in the hands

54:23.680 --> 54:27.120
 of the computer scientists and the neuroscientists.

54:27.120 --> 54:29.520
 Not a physicist, with the help.

54:29.520 --> 54:31.720
 Perhaps at some point, but I think physicists

54:31.720 --> 54:34.640
 will try to simplify it down to something

54:34.640 --> 54:36.320
 that they can use their methods

54:36.320 --> 54:38.560
 and maybe they're not appropriate.

54:38.560 --> 54:43.560
 Maybe we simply need to do more machine learning

54:43.560 --> 54:47.800
 on bigger scales, evolve machines.

54:47.800 --> 54:49.360
 Machines not only that learn

54:49.360 --> 54:51.320
 but evolve their own architecture.

54:51.320 --> 54:54.300
 As a process of learning, evolve in architecture.

54:54.300 --> 54:56.960
 Not under our control, only partially under our control,

54:56.960 --> 54:59.220
 but under the control of machine learning.

55:00.320 --> 55:03.200
 I'll tell you another thing that I find awesome.

55:03.200 --> 55:05.640
 You know this Google thing that they taught

55:05.640 --> 55:07.480
 the computers how to play chess?

55:07.480 --> 55:08.320
 Yeah, yeah.

55:08.320 --> 55:10.680
 Okay, they taught the computers how to play chess,

55:10.680 --> 55:12.440
 not by teaching them how to play chess,

55:12.440 --> 55:14.400
 but just having them play against each other.

55:14.400 --> 55:15.400
 Against each other, self play.

55:15.400 --> 55:17.840
 Against each other, this is a form of evolution.

55:18.800 --> 55:22.920
 These machines evolved, they evolved in intelligence.

55:25.600 --> 55:27.400
 They evolved in intelligence

55:27.400 --> 55:30.880
 without anybody telling them how to do it.

55:30.880 --> 55:33.240
 They were not engineered, they just played

55:33.240 --> 55:36.040
 against each other and got better and better and better.

55:36.040 --> 55:41.040
 That makes me think that machines can evolve intelligence.

55:43.500 --> 55:46.580
 What exact kind of intelligence, I don't know.

55:46.580 --> 55:49.020
 But in understanding that better and better,

55:49.020 --> 55:52.260
 maybe we'll get better clues as to what goes on

55:52.260 --> 55:53.100
 in our own intelligence.

55:53.100 --> 55:55.220
 What life in intelligence is.

55:55.220 --> 55:58.700
 Last question, what kind of questions can science

55:58.700 --> 56:01.820
 not currently answer and may never be able to answer?

56:01.820 --> 56:02.660
 Yeah.

56:02.660 --> 56:03.500
 Yeah.

56:05.620 --> 56:07.300
 Is there an intelligence out there

56:07.300 --> 56:09.260
 that's underlies the whole thing?

56:09.260 --> 56:11.980
 You can call them with a G word if you want.

56:11.980 --> 56:16.920
 I can say, are we a computer simulation with a purpose?

56:18.960 --> 56:22.560
 Is there an agent, an intelligent agent

56:22.560 --> 56:27.180
 that underlies or is responsible for the whole thing?

56:27.180 --> 56:30.560
 Does that intelligent agent satisfy the laws of physics?

56:30.560 --> 56:32.600
 Does it satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics?

56:32.600 --> 56:34.460
 Is it made of atoms and molecules?

56:34.460 --> 56:36.560
 Yeah, there's a lot of questions.

56:36.560 --> 56:41.080
 And I don't see, it seems to me a real question.

56:42.080 --> 56:43.500
 It's an answerable question.

56:43.500 --> 56:44.800
 Well, I don't know if it's answerable.

56:44.800 --> 56:47.360
 The questions have to be answerable to be real.

56:49.300 --> 56:52.240
 Some philosophers would say that a question

56:52.240 --> 56:54.520
 is not a question unless it's answerable.

56:55.580 --> 56:58.300
 This question doesn't seem to me answerable

56:58.300 --> 57:03.300
 by any known method, but it seems to me real.

57:05.140 --> 57:07.180
 There's no better place to end.

57:07.180 --> 57:08.660
 Leonard, thank you so much for talking today.

57:08.660 --> 57:28.660
 Okay, good.
