00:00.000 --> 00:02.900
 The following is a conversation with Simon Sinek,

00:02.900 --> 00:06.380
 author of several books, including Start With Why,

00:06.380 --> 00:10.360
 Leaders Eat Last, and his latest, The Infinite Game.

00:11.220 --> 00:12.780
 He's one of the best communicators

00:12.780 --> 00:14.700
 of what it takes to be a good leader,

00:14.700 --> 00:16.900
 to inspire, and to build businesses

00:16.900 --> 00:19.420
 that solve big, difficult challenges.

00:21.060 --> 00:23.700
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.940
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

00:25.940 --> 00:28.280
 review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,

00:28.280 --> 00:31.600
 support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter,

00:31.600 --> 00:35.780
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

00:35.780 --> 00:38.360
 As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now,

00:38.360 --> 00:39.740
 and never any ads in the middle

00:39.740 --> 00:42.200
 that can break the flow of the conversation.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.640
 I hope that works for you,

00:43.640 --> 00:45.920
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.580
 Quick summary of the ads.

00:48.580 --> 00:52.540
 Two sponsors, Cash App and Masterclass.

00:52.540 --> 00:54.280
 Please consider supporting the podcast

00:54.280 --> 00:57.880
 by downloading Cash App and using code LexPodcast,

00:57.880 --> 01:02.880
 and signing up to Masterclass at Masterclass.com slash Lex.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.660
 This show is presented by Cash App,

01:06.660 --> 01:09.500
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

01:09.500 --> 01:13.300
 When you get it, use code LexPodcast.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.340
 Cash App lets you send money to friends,

01:15.340 --> 01:17.860
 buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market

01:17.860 --> 01:20.780
 with as little as one dollar.

01:20.780 --> 01:23.020
 Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,

01:23.020 --> 01:25.100
 let me mention that cryptocurrency,

01:25.100 --> 01:28.620
 in the context of the history of money, is fascinating.

01:28.620 --> 01:32.540
 I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.

01:32.540 --> 01:37.540
 Debits and credits on Ledger started around 30,000 years ago.

01:37.700 --> 01:40.540
 The US dollar created over 200 years ago,

01:40.540 --> 01:43.940
 and Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency,

01:43.940 --> 01:46.340
 released just over 10 years ago.

01:46.340 --> 01:50.220
 So given that history, cryptocurrency's still very much

01:50.220 --> 01:52.140
 in its early days of development,

01:52.140 --> 01:55.300
 but it's still aiming to, and just might,

01:55.300 --> 01:57.560
 redefine the nature of money.

01:58.420 --> 02:00.820
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store

02:00.820 --> 02:04.440
 or Google Play, and use the code LexPodcast,

02:04.440 --> 02:08.460
 you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 the first,

02:08.460 --> 02:11.100
 an organization that is helping to advance robotics

02:11.100 --> 02:14.820
 and STEM education for young people around the world.

02:14.820 --> 02:17.200

02:24.060 --> 02:26.140
 When I first heard about Masterclass,

02:26.140 --> 02:28.780
 I honestly thought it was too good to be true.

02:28.780 --> 02:32.620
 For $180 a year, you get an all access pass

02:32.620 --> 02:36.680
 to watch courses from experts at the top of their field.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.580
 To list some of my favorites,

02:38.580 --> 02:41.200
 Chris Hatfield on Space Exploration,

02:41.200 --> 02:43.260
 Neil deGrasse Tyson on Scientific Thinking

02:43.260 --> 02:47.620
 and Communication, Will Wright, the creator of SimCity,

02:47.620 --> 02:50.260
 and Sims on Game Design.

02:50.260 --> 02:51.860
 I love that game.

02:51.860 --> 02:54.860
 Jane Goodall on Conservation, Carlos Santana,

02:54.860 --> 02:57.400
 one of my favorite guitarists on guitar,

02:57.400 --> 03:01.240
 Gary Kasparov on Chess, obviously I'm Russian,

03:01.240 --> 03:04.300
 I love Gary, Daniel Negrano on Poker,

03:04.300 --> 03:05.820
 one of my favorite poker players,

03:05.820 --> 03:09.420
 also Phil Ivey gives a course as well,

03:09.420 --> 03:11.320
 and many, many more.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.020
 Chris Hatfield explaining how rockets work

03:14.020 --> 03:17.200
 and the experience of being launched into space alone

03:17.200 --> 03:18.900
 is worth the money.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.980
 By way of advice, for me, the key is not to be overwhelmed

03:21.980 --> 03:24.180
 by the abundance of choice.

03:24.180 --> 03:26.180
 Pick three courses you want to complete,

03:26.180 --> 03:28.580
 watch each all the way through from start to finish,

03:28.580 --> 03:30.780
 it's not that long, but it's an experience

03:30.780 --> 03:33.940
 that will stick with you for a long time, I promise.

03:33.940 --> 03:35.460
 It's easily worth the money,

03:35.460 --> 03:38.040
 you can watch it on basically any device.

03:38.040 --> 03:42.060

03:45.740 --> 03:49.440
 And now, here's my conversation with Simon Sinek.

03:50.340 --> 03:53.140
 In the Infinite Game, your most recent book,

03:53.140 --> 03:56.060
 you describe the finite game and the infinite game,

03:56.060 --> 03:58.660
 so from my perspective of artificial intelligence

03:58.660 --> 04:03.660
 and game theory in general, I'm a huge fan of finite games

04:03.860 --> 04:05.220
 from the broad philosophical sense,

04:05.220 --> 04:07.620
 it's something that in the robotics,

04:07.620 --> 04:09.620
 artificial intelligence space, we know how to deal with,

04:09.620 --> 04:11.700
 and then you describe the infinite game,

04:11.700 --> 04:13.940
 which has no exact static rules,

04:13.940 --> 04:17.340
 has no well defined static objective,

04:17.340 --> 04:19.740
 the players are known, unknown, they change,

04:19.740 --> 04:21.420
 there's the dynamic element,

04:21.420 --> 04:26.260
 so this is something that applies to business, politics,

04:26.260 --> 04:30.180
 life itself, so can you try to articulate

04:30.180 --> 04:33.960
 the objective function here of the infinite game,

04:33.960 --> 04:38.960
 or in the cliche, broad philosophical sense,

04:39.180 --> 04:41.600
 what is the meaning of life?

04:41.600 --> 04:44.960
 Go for the, start with a softball.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.600
 Yep, easy question first.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.800
 So James Kars was the philosopher

04:50.800 --> 04:52.320
 who originally articulated this concept

04:52.320 --> 04:54.080
 of finite and infinite games,

04:54.080 --> 04:56.240
 and when I learned about it,

04:56.240 --> 05:00.060
 it really challenged my view of how the world works, right?

05:00.060 --> 05:02.580
 Because I think we all think about winning

05:02.580 --> 05:04.040
 and being the best and being number one,

05:04.040 --> 05:05.400
 but if you think about it,

05:06.440 --> 05:07.920
 only in a finite game can that exist,

05:07.920 --> 05:11.920
 a game that has fixed rules, agreed upon objectives,

05:11.920 --> 05:14.000
 and known players, like football or baseball,

05:14.000 --> 05:15.360
 there's always a beginning, middle, and end,

05:15.360 --> 05:17.120
 and if there's a winner, there has to be a loser.

05:17.120 --> 05:20.680
 Infinite games, as Kars describes them,

05:20.680 --> 05:22.940
 as you said, have known and unknown players,

05:22.940 --> 05:24.640
 which means anyone can join,

05:24.640 --> 05:26.220
 it has changeable rules,

05:26.220 --> 05:27.840
 which means you can play however you want,

05:27.840 --> 05:29.460
 and the objective is to perpetuate the game,

05:29.460 --> 05:32.200
 to stay in the game as long as possible.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.140
 In other words, there's no such thing

05:33.140 --> 05:34.440
 as being number one or winning

05:34.440 --> 05:36.680
 in a game that has no finish line.

05:36.680 --> 05:40.680
 And what I learned is that when we try to win

05:40.680 --> 05:42.820
 in a game that has no finish line,

05:42.820 --> 05:44.840
 we try to be number, we try to be the best

05:44.840 --> 05:46.640
 in a game that has no agreed upon objectives

05:46.640 --> 05:49.320
 or agreed upon metrics or timeframes,

05:49.320 --> 05:51.840
 there's a few consistent and predictable outcomes,

05:51.840 --> 05:54.400
 the decline of trust, the decline of cooperation,

05:54.400 --> 05:55.680
 the decline of innovation.

05:57.120 --> 06:01.040
 And I find this fascinating because so many of the ways

06:01.040 --> 06:04.040
 that we run most organizations is with a finite mindset.

06:04.040 --> 06:06.920
 So trying to reduce the beautiful complex thing

06:06.920 --> 06:09.600
 that is life or whatever, politics or business,

06:09.600 --> 06:12.040
 into something very narrow,

06:12.040 --> 06:14.840
 and in that process, the reductionist process,

06:14.840 --> 06:16.240
 you lose something fundamental

06:16.240 --> 06:20.240
 that makes the whole thing work in the long term.

06:20.240 --> 06:24.640
 So returning, not gonna let you off the hook easy,

06:24.640 --> 06:26.920
 what is the meaning of life?

06:26.920 --> 06:28.460
 So what is the objective function

06:28.460 --> 06:31.040
 that is worthwhile to pursue?

06:31.040 --> 06:34.080
 Well, if you think about our tombstones, right?

06:34.080 --> 06:36.480
 They have the date we were born and the date we died,

06:36.480 --> 06:39.920
 but really it's what we do with the gap in between.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.860
 There's a poem called The Dash.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.000
 You know, it's the dash that matters.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.520
 It's what we do between the time we're born

06:45.520 --> 06:47.800
 and the time we die that gives our life meaning.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.200
 And if we live our lives with a finite mindset,

06:50.200 --> 06:52.420
 which means to accumulate more power or money

06:52.420 --> 06:54.360
 than anybody else, to outdo everyone else,

06:54.360 --> 06:55.760
 to be number one, to be the best,

06:55.760 --> 06:56.920
 we don't take any of us with us.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.580
 We don't take any of it with us.

06:58.580 --> 06:59.540
 We just die.

06:59.540 --> 07:04.200
 The people who get remembered the way we wanna be remembered

07:04.200 --> 07:06.280
 is what kind of people we were, right?

07:06.280 --> 07:08.080
 Devoted mother, loving father,

07:08.080 --> 07:10.560
 what kind of person we were to other people.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.180
 Jack Welch just died recently,

07:13.180 --> 07:14.820
 and the Washington Post,

07:14.820 --> 07:18.360
 when it wrote the headline for his obit,

07:18.360 --> 07:23.160
 it wrote, he pleased Wall Street and distressed employees.

07:23.160 --> 07:24.560
 And that's his legacy.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.920
 A finite player who is obsessed with winning,

07:27.920 --> 07:32.040
 who leaves behind a legacy of short term gains for a few

07:32.040 --> 07:33.680
 and distress for many.

07:33.680 --> 07:34.520
 That's his legacy.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.040
 And every single one of us gets the choice

07:37.040 --> 07:39.640
 of the kind of legacy we wanna have.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.480
 Do we wanna be remembered for our contributions

07:41.480 --> 07:43.880
 or our detractions?

07:43.880 --> 07:45.480
 To live with a finite mindset,

07:45.480 --> 07:47.780
 to live a career with a finite mindset,

07:47.780 --> 07:50.280
 to be number one, be the best, be the most famous,

07:53.200 --> 07:56.360
 you live a life like Jack Welch, you know?

07:56.360 --> 07:59.180
 To live a life of service, to see those around us rise,

07:59.180 --> 08:01.980
 to contribute to our communities, to our organizations,

08:01.980 --> 08:04.600
 to leave them in better shape than we found them,

08:04.600 --> 08:07.860
 that's the kind of legacy most of us would like to have.

08:07.860 --> 08:09.720
 So day to day, when you think about

08:09.720 --> 08:13.720
 what is the fundamental goals, dreams,

08:17.600 --> 08:20.920
 motivations of an infinite game,

08:20.920 --> 08:24.540
 of seeing your life, your career as an infinite game,

08:24.540 --> 08:26.160
 what does that look like?

08:26.160 --> 08:29.640
 I mean, I guess I'm sort of trying to stick

08:29.640 --> 08:32.160
 on this personal ego, personal drive,

08:32.160 --> 08:35.440
 the thing that the fire, the reason we wanna wake up

08:35.440 --> 08:37.500
 in the morning and the reason we can't go to bed

08:37.500 --> 08:39.640
 because we're so excited, what is that?

08:39.640 --> 08:41.780
 So for me, it's about having a just cause.

08:41.780 --> 08:44.260
 It's about a vision that's bigger than me,

08:44.260 --> 08:45.640
 that my work gets to contribute

08:45.640 --> 08:48.420
 to something larger than myself, you know?

08:48.420 --> 08:51.340
 That's what drives me every day.

08:51.340 --> 08:53.800
 I wake up every morning with a vision of a world

08:53.800 --> 08:55.940
 that does not yet exist, a world in which the vast majority

08:55.940 --> 08:58.320
 of people wake up every single morning inspired,

08:58.320 --> 09:01.140
 feel safe at work and return home fulfilled

09:01.140 --> 09:02.080
 at the end of the day.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.680
 It is not the world we live in.

09:03.680 --> 09:06.680
 And so that we still have work to do

09:06.680 --> 09:08.320
 is the thing that drives me.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.880
 You know, I know what my underlying values are.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.380
 You know, I wake up to inspire people

09:12.380 --> 09:13.600
 to do the things that inspire them.

09:13.600 --> 09:16.040
 And these are the things that, these are the things that I,

09:16.040 --> 09:17.880
 these are my go tos, my touch points

09:20.280 --> 09:21.920
 that inspire me to keep working.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.360
 You know, I think of a career like an iceberg.

09:24.360 --> 09:27.000
 You know, if you have a vision for something,

09:27.000 --> 09:28.660
 you're the only one who can see the iceberg

09:28.660 --> 09:30.320
 underneath the ocean.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.260
 But if you start working at it, a little bit shows up.

09:33.260 --> 09:35.200
 And now a few other people can see what you imagine,

09:35.200 --> 09:36.460
 be like, oh, right, yeah, no,

09:36.460 --> 09:37.720
 I wanna help build that as well.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.320
 And if you have a lot of success,

09:39.320 --> 09:40.280
 then you have a lot of iceberg

09:40.280 --> 09:41.320
 and people can see this huge iceberg

09:41.320 --> 09:43.000
 and they say, you've accomplished so much.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.080
 But what I see is all the work still yet to be done.

09:47.080 --> 09:49.720
 You know, I still see the huge iceberg underneath the ocean.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.240
 And so the growth, you talk about momentum.

09:52.240 --> 09:56.720
 So the incremental revealing of the iceberg

09:56.720 --> 09:58.160
 is what drives you.

09:58.160 --> 10:00.680
 Well, it necessarily is incremental.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.600
 What drives me is that, is the realization,

10:03.600 --> 10:06.560
 is realizing the iceberg, bringing more of the iceberg

10:06.560 --> 10:08.040
 from the unknown to the known,

10:08.040 --> 10:11.380
 bringing more of the vision from the imagination to reality.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.480
 And you have this fundamental vision of optimism.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.400
 You call yourself an optimist.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.160
 I mean, in this world, I have a sort of,

10:20.160 --> 10:23.400
 I see myself a little bit as the main character

10:23.400 --> 10:25.360
 from The Idiot by Dostoevsky,

10:25.360 --> 10:29.080
 who is also kind of seen by society as a fool

10:29.080 --> 10:32.320
 because he was optimistic.

10:32.320 --> 10:35.240
 So one, can you maybe articulate

10:35.240 --> 10:37.560
 where that sense of optimism comes from?

10:37.560 --> 10:41.120
 And maybe also try to articulate your vision of the future

10:41.120 --> 10:46.000
 where people are inspired, where optimism drives us.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.160
 It's easy to forget that when you look at social media

10:48.160 --> 10:51.080
 and so on, where the word toxicity and negativity

10:51.080 --> 10:53.080
 can often get more likes,

10:53.080 --> 10:56.300
 that optimism has a sort of a beauty to it.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.080
 And I do hope it's out there.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.280
 So can you try to articulate that vision?

11:00.280 --> 11:04.320
 Yeah, so I mean, for me, optimism and being an optimist

11:04.320 --> 11:08.040
 is just seeing the silver lining in every cloud.

11:08.040 --> 11:11.280
 Even in tragedy, it brings people together.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.680
 And the question is, can we see that?

11:12.680 --> 11:15.820
 Can you see the beauty that is in everything?

11:15.820 --> 11:19.480
 And I don't think optimism is foolishness.

11:20.820 --> 11:22.980
 I don't think optimism is blindness,

11:23.980 --> 11:26.140
 though it probably involves some naivete,

11:27.140 --> 11:29.740
 the belief that things will get better,

11:29.740 --> 11:32.500
 the belief that we tend towards the good,

11:33.820 --> 11:36.020
 even in times of struggle or bad.

11:39.200 --> 11:42.420
 You can't sustain war, but you can sustain peace.

11:42.420 --> 11:46.540
 I think things that are stable are more sustainable,

11:46.540 --> 11:49.540
 things that are optimistic are more sustainable

11:49.540 --> 11:52.120
 than things that are chaotic.

11:53.220 --> 11:54.860
 So you see people as fundamentally good.

11:54.860 --> 11:56.540
 I mean, some people may disagree

11:56.540 --> 12:00.460
 that you can't sustain peace, you can't sustain war.

12:00.460 --> 12:03.780
 I mean, I think war is costly.

12:03.780 --> 12:05.300
 It involves life and money,

12:06.300 --> 12:08.500
 and peace does not involve those things.

12:08.500 --> 12:09.740
 It requires work.

12:09.740 --> 12:11.720
 I'm not saying it doesn't require work,

12:11.720 --> 12:14.120
 but it doesn't drain resources,

12:14.120 --> 12:15.820
 I think the same way that war does.

12:17.180 --> 12:19.520
 The people that would say that we will always have war,

12:19.520 --> 12:21.680
 and I just talked to the historian of Stalin,

12:22.980 --> 12:27.100
 would say that conflict and the desire for power

12:27.100 --> 12:30.560
 and conflict is central to human nature.

12:30.560 --> 12:31.880
 I concur.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.940
 But something in your words also,

12:34.940 --> 12:38.140
 perhaps it's the naive aspect that I also share,

12:38.140 --> 12:39.460
 is that you have an optimism

12:39.460 --> 12:41.380
 that people are fundamentally good.

12:41.380 --> 12:44.460
 I'm an idealist, and I think idealism is good.

12:44.460 --> 12:46.820
 I'm not a fool to believe that the ideals

12:46.820 --> 12:48.460
 that I imagine can come true.

12:48.460 --> 12:50.500
 Of course, there'll never be world peace,

12:50.500 --> 12:53.100
 but shouldn't we die trying?

12:53.100 --> 12:54.180
 I think that's the whole point.

12:54.180 --> 12:55.220
 That's the whole point of vision.

12:55.220 --> 12:56.580
 Vision should be idealistic,

12:56.580 --> 13:00.520
 and it should be, for all practical purposes, impossible.

13:02.140 --> 13:03.420
 But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try,

13:03.420 --> 13:06.960
 and it's the milestones that we reach

13:06.960 --> 13:09.260
 that take us closer to that ideal

13:09.260 --> 13:12.420
 that make us feel that our life and our work have meaning,

13:12.420 --> 13:14.460
 and we're contributing to something bigger than ourselves.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.260
 You know, just because it's impossible

13:17.260 --> 13:19.620
 doesn't mean we shouldn't try.

13:19.620 --> 13:21.720
 As I said, we're still moving the ball down the field.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.140
 We're still making progress.

13:23.140 --> 13:24.680
 Things are still getting better,

13:24.680 --> 13:27.300
 even if we never get to that ideal state.

13:27.300 --> 13:29.560
 So I think idealism is a good thing.

13:30.980 --> 13:34.100
 You know, in the word infinite game,

13:34.100 --> 13:37.060
 one of the beautiful and tragic aspects of life,

13:37.060 --> 13:39.260
 human life at least, at least from the biological

13:39.260 --> 13:41.440
 perspective, is that it ends.

13:43.060 --> 13:44.740
 So sadly, it's.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.220
 To some people, yeah.

13:46.220 --> 13:50.300
 Fine, it's tragic to some people, or is it ends, it ends?

13:50.300 --> 13:53.260
 I think some people believe that it ends on the day you die,

13:53.260 --> 13:54.620
 and some people think it continues on.

13:54.620 --> 13:56.460
 There's, and there's a lot of different ways

13:56.460 --> 13:58.780
 to think what continues on even looks like.

13:58.780 --> 14:01.820
 But let me drag it back to the personal.

14:01.820 --> 14:02.660
 Sure.

14:02.660 --> 14:06.180
 Which is, how do you think about your own mortality?

14:06.180 --> 14:07.700
 Are you afraid of death?

14:07.700 --> 14:10.140
 How do you think about your own death?

14:10.140 --> 14:12.380
 I definitely haven't accomplished everything

14:12.380 --> 14:14.060
 I want to contribute to.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.940
 I would like more time on this earth

14:17.940 --> 14:20.700
 to keep working towards that vision.

14:20.700 --> 14:22.580
 Do you think about the fact that it ends for you?

14:22.580 --> 14:23.860
 Are you cognizant of it?

14:23.860 --> 14:24.980
 Of course I'm cognizant of it.

14:24.980 --> 14:26.140
 I mean, aren't we all?

14:27.420 --> 14:29.980
 I don't dwell on it.

14:30.980 --> 14:32.180
 I'm aware of it.

14:32.180 --> 14:33.700
 I know that my life is finite,

14:33.700 --> 14:36.040
 and I know that I have a certain amount of time left

14:36.040 --> 14:40.260
 on this planet, and I'd like to make that time be valuable.

14:40.260 --> 14:42.740
 You know, some people would think that ideas

14:42.740 --> 14:46.860
 kind of allow you to have a certain kind of immortality.

14:46.860 --> 14:47.700
 Yeah.

14:52.340 --> 14:54.620
 Maybe to linger on this kind of question.

14:54.620 --> 14:56.460
 So first to push back on the,

14:56.460 --> 14:58.840
 you said that everyone's cognizant of their mortality.

14:58.840 --> 15:02.660
 There's a guy named Ernest Becker who would disagree,

15:02.660 --> 15:05.460
 that you basically say that most of human cognition

15:05.460 --> 15:09.960
 is created by us trying to create an illusion

15:09.960 --> 15:11.980
 and try to hide the fact from ourselves,

15:11.980 --> 15:13.360
 the fact that we're gonna die,

15:13.360 --> 15:17.000
 to try to think that it's all gonna go on forever.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.540
 But the fact that we know that it doesn't.

15:19.540 --> 15:21.820
 Yes, but this mix of denial.

15:21.820 --> 15:24.420
 I mean, I think the book's called Denial of Death.

15:24.420 --> 15:27.560
 It's this constant denial that we're running away from.

15:30.200 --> 15:33.740
 In fact, some would argue that the inspiration,

15:33.740 --> 15:35.540
 the incredible ideas you've put out there,

15:35.540 --> 15:37.500
 your TED Talk has been seen by millions

15:37.500 --> 15:38.820
 and millions of people, right?

15:38.820 --> 15:41.780
 It's just you trying to desperately fight the fact

15:41.780 --> 15:43.860
 that you are biologically mortal.

15:45.860 --> 15:48.140
 Your creative genius comes from the fact

15:48.140 --> 15:49.440
 that you're trying to create ideas

15:49.440 --> 15:51.100
 that live on long past you.

15:52.180 --> 15:53.140
 Well, that's very nice of you.

15:53.140 --> 15:57.260
 I mean, I would like my ideas to live on beyond me

15:57.260 --> 15:59.420
 because I think that is a good test

15:59.420 --> 16:03.540
 that those ideas have value in the lives of others.

16:03.540 --> 16:05.420
 I think that's a good test.

16:05.420 --> 16:08.780
 That others would continue to talk about

16:08.780 --> 16:12.560
 or share the ideas long after I'm gone,

16:12.560 --> 16:16.420
 I think is perhaps the greatest compliment

16:16.420 --> 16:18.020
 one can get for one's own work.

16:20.620 --> 16:23.460
 But I don't think it's my awareness of my mortality

16:23.460 --> 16:25.580
 that drives me to do it.

16:25.580 --> 16:28.180
 It's my desire to contribute that drives me to do it.

16:30.100 --> 16:32.800
 It's the optimist vision.

16:32.800 --> 16:36.500
 It's the pleasure and the fulfillment you get

16:36.500 --> 16:38.600
 from inspiring others.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.220
 It's as pure as that.

16:42.060 --> 16:43.380
 Let me ask, listen, I'm rushing.

16:43.380 --> 16:47.360
 I'm trying to get you to get you into these dark areas.

16:47.360 --> 16:50.020
 Is the ego tied up into it somehow?

16:50.020 --> 16:54.460
 So your name is extremely well known.

16:54.460 --> 16:56.100
 If your name wasn't attached to it,

16:56.100 --> 16:58.580
 do you think you would act differently?

16:58.580 --> 17:02.280
 I mean, for years, I hated that my name was attached to it.

17:02.280 --> 17:06.100
 I had a rule for years that I wouldn't have my face

17:06.100 --> 17:08.220
 on the front page of the website.

17:09.820 --> 17:10.900
 I had a fight with the publisher

17:10.900 --> 17:14.080
 because I didn't want my name big on the book.

17:14.080 --> 17:15.500
 I wanted it tiny on the book.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.100
 Because I kept telling them it's not about me,

17:17.100 --> 17:18.220
 it's about the ideas.

17:18.220 --> 17:20.660
 They wanted to put my name on the top of my book, I refused.

17:20.660 --> 17:22.460
 None of my books have my names on the top

17:22.460 --> 17:25.300
 because I won't let them.

17:25.300 --> 17:26.560
 They would like very much to put my name

17:26.560 --> 17:27.400
 on the top of the book,

17:27.400 --> 17:30.260
 but the idea has to be bigger than me.

17:30.260 --> 17:32.060
 I'm not bigger than the idea.

17:32.060 --> 17:32.900
 That's beautifully put.

17:32.900 --> 17:34.460
 Do you think ego?

17:34.460 --> 17:38.020
 But I also am aware that I've become recognized

17:38.020 --> 17:39.340
 as the messenger.

17:39.340 --> 17:41.980
 And even though I still think the message is bigger than me,

17:41.980 --> 17:45.160
 I recognize that I have a responsibility as the messenger.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.580
 And whether I like it or not is irrelevant.

17:47.580 --> 17:51.680
 I accept the responsibility, I'm happy to do it.

17:53.060 --> 17:54.760
 I'm not sure how to phrase this,

17:54.760 --> 17:58.940
 but there's a large part of the culture right now

17:58.940 --> 18:03.420
 that emphasizes all the things that nobody disagrees with,

18:03.420 --> 18:07.100
 which is health, sleep, diet, relaxation,

18:07.100 --> 18:10.340
 meditation, vacation, are really important.

18:10.340 --> 18:11.740
 And there's no, it's like,

18:11.740 --> 18:13.460
 you can't really argue against that.

18:13.460 --> 18:14.420
 In fact, people.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.040
 Less sleep.

18:16.040 --> 18:16.880
 Less.

18:16.880 --> 18:17.700
 Just, I'm joking.

18:17.700 --> 18:18.940
 Yes, well, that's the thing.

18:18.940 --> 18:23.820
 I often speak to the fact that passion

18:23.820 --> 18:28.320
 and love for what you're doing and the two words hard work,

18:28.320 --> 18:30.320
 especially in the engineering fields,

18:30.320 --> 18:32.540
 are more important than,

18:32.540 --> 18:35.000
 are more important to prioritize than sleep.

18:35.880 --> 18:38.140
 Even though sleep is really important,

18:38.140 --> 18:40.560
 your mind should be obsessed with the hard work,

18:40.560 --> 18:41.860
 with the passion, and so on.

18:41.860 --> 18:44.900
 And then I get some pushback, of course, from people.

18:44.900 --> 18:46.100
 What do you make sense of that?

18:46.100 --> 18:49.140
 Is that just me, the crazy Russian engineer,

18:49.140 --> 18:50.340
 really pushing hard work?

18:50.340 --> 18:51.160
 Probably.

18:52.460 --> 18:55.120
 I think that that's a short term strategy.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.900
 I think if you sacrifice your health for the work,

18:57.900 --> 19:00.380
 at some point, it catches up with you.

19:00.380 --> 19:02.500
 And at some point, it's like going, going, going,

19:02.500 --> 19:03.460
 and you get sick.

19:03.460 --> 19:04.740
 Your body will shut down for you

19:04.740 --> 19:06.900
 if you refuse to take care of yourself.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.080
 You get sick.

19:09.080 --> 19:09.920
 It's what happens.

19:09.920 --> 19:12.540
 Sometimes, more severe illness

19:12.540 --> 19:14.240
 than something that just slows you down.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.940
 So I think taking, getting sleep,

19:17.940 --> 19:20.900
 I mean, there have been studies on this that,

19:20.900 --> 19:24.060
 executives, for example, who get a full night's sleep

19:24.060 --> 19:26.020
 and stop at a reasonable hour,

19:26.020 --> 19:29.620
 actually accomplish more, are more productive

19:29.620 --> 19:31.540
 than people who work and burn the midnight oil

19:31.540 --> 19:33.500
 because their brains are working better

19:33.500 --> 19:35.380
 because they're well rested.

19:35.380 --> 19:37.940
 So, you know, working hard, yes,

19:37.940 --> 19:39.280
 but why not work smart?

19:41.180 --> 19:45.380
 I think that giving our minds and our bodies rest

19:45.380 --> 19:46.640
 makes us more efficient.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.220
 I think just driving, driving, driving, driving

19:49.220 --> 19:52.100
 is a short term, it's a short term strategy.

19:52.100 --> 19:54.300
 So, but to push back on that a little bit,

19:54.300 --> 19:57.020
 the annoying thing is you're like 100% right

19:57.020 --> 19:58.660
 in terms of science, right?

19:58.660 --> 20:02.940
 But the thing is, because you're 100% right,

20:02.940 --> 20:07.540
 that weak part of your mind uses that fact

20:07.540 --> 20:10.140
 to convince you, like what, so, you know,

20:10.140 --> 20:12.100
 I get all kinds of, my mind comes up

20:12.100 --> 20:14.300
 with all kinds of excuses to try to convince me

20:14.300 --> 20:16.020
 that I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing.

20:16.020 --> 20:18.060
 To rationalize. To rationalize.

20:18.060 --> 20:21.300
 And so what I have a sense,

20:21.300 --> 20:23.820
 I think what you said about executives and leaders

20:23.820 --> 20:26.860
 is absolutely right, but there's the early days.

20:26.860 --> 20:29.100
 The early days of madness and passion.

20:29.100 --> 20:29.940
 For sure.

20:29.940 --> 20:33.700
 Then I feel like emphasizing sleep,

20:33.700 --> 20:37.580
 thinking about sleep is giving yourself a way out

20:37.580 --> 20:39.500
 from the fact that those early days,

20:39.500 --> 20:42.800
 especially, can be suffering.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.700
 As long, it's not sustainable.

20:45.700 --> 20:46.980
 You know, it's not sustainable.

20:46.980 --> 20:50.140
 Sure, if you're investing all that energy in something

20:50.140 --> 20:52.620
 at the beginning to get it up and running,

20:52.620 --> 20:55.660
 then at some point you're gonna have to slow down.

20:55.660 --> 20:57.580
 Or your body will slow you down for you.

20:57.580 --> 20:59.980
 Like, you can choose or your body can choose.

21:01.820 --> 21:02.660
 I mean.

21:02.660 --> 21:04.820
 So, okay, so you don't think, from my perspective,

21:04.820 --> 21:07.380
 it feels like people have gotten a little bit soft.

21:07.380 --> 21:08.220
 But you're saying, no.

21:08.220 --> 21:11.140
 I think that there seems evidence

21:11.140 --> 21:16.140
 that working harder and later have taken a back seat.

21:16.140 --> 21:18.300
 I've taken a back seat.

21:21.580 --> 21:24.660
 I think we have to be careful with broad generalizations.

21:24.660 --> 21:28.140
 But I think if you go into the workplace,

21:28.140 --> 21:29.540
 there are people who would complain

21:29.540 --> 21:33.300
 that more people now than before,

21:33.300 --> 21:34.940
 you know, look at their watches and say,

21:34.940 --> 21:36.580
 oops, five o clock, goodbye.

21:36.580 --> 21:37.420
 Right?

21:37.420 --> 21:39.580
 Now, is that a problem with the people?

21:39.580 --> 21:41.700
 You're saying it's the people giving themselves excuses

21:41.700 --> 21:42.960
 and people who don't work hard.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.040
 Or is it the organizations aren't giving them something

21:45.040 --> 21:46.820
 to believe in, something to be passionate about?

21:46.820 --> 21:48.100
 We can't manufacture passion.

21:48.100 --> 21:51.040
 You can't just tell someone, be passionate.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.360
 You know, that's not how it works.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.100
 Passion's an output, not an input.

21:55.420 --> 21:56.440
 Like if I believe in something

21:56.440 --> 21:58.780
 and I wanna contribute all that energy to do it,

21:58.780 --> 22:00.220
 we call that passion.

22:00.220 --> 22:02.340
 You know, working hard for something we love is passion.

22:02.340 --> 22:04.140
 Working hard for something we don't care about

22:04.140 --> 22:05.260
 is called stress.

22:05.260 --> 22:07.760
 But we're working hard either way.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.380
 So I think the organizations bear some accountability

22:10.380 --> 22:11.680
 and our leaders bear some accountability,

22:11.680 --> 22:13.580
 which is if they're not offering a sense of purpose,

22:13.580 --> 22:15.500
 if they're not offering us a sense of cause,

22:15.500 --> 22:17.660
 if they're not telling us that our work is worth more

22:17.660 --> 22:19.780
 than simply the money it makes,

22:19.780 --> 22:21.140
 then yeah, I'm gonna come at five o clock

22:21.140 --> 22:23.180
 because I don't really care about making you money.

22:23.180 --> 22:24.620
 Remember, we live in a world right now

22:24.620 --> 22:26.980
 where a lot of people, rather a few people,

22:26.980 --> 22:29.700
 are getting rich on the hard work of others.

22:29.700 --> 22:33.020
 And so I think when people look up and say,

22:33.020 --> 22:34.620
 well, why would I do that?

22:34.620 --> 22:36.600
 I'll just, if you're not gonna look after me

22:36.600 --> 22:38.180
 and then you're gonna lay me off at the end of the year

22:38.180 --> 22:40.460
 because you missed your arbitrary projections,

22:40.460 --> 22:41.740
 you know, you're gonna lay me off

22:41.740 --> 22:43.940
 because you missed your arbitrary projections,

22:43.940 --> 22:47.420
 then why would I offer my hard work and loyalty to you?

22:47.420 --> 22:50.740
 So I think, I don't think we can immediately blame people

22:50.740 --> 22:51.940
 for going soft.

22:51.940 --> 22:56.940
 I think we can blame leaders for their inability

22:56.980 --> 22:59.420
 or failure to offer their people something bigger

22:59.420 --> 23:02.660
 than making a product or making money.

23:02.660 --> 23:04.300
 Yeah, so that's brilliant.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.940
 And start with why, leaders eat less, your books.

23:07.940 --> 23:12.940
 You basically talk about what it takes to be a good leader.

23:13.980 --> 23:15.700
 And so some of the blame should go on the leader,

23:15.700 --> 23:19.900
 but how much of it is on finding your passion?

23:19.900 --> 23:21.900
 How much is it on the individual?

23:21.900 --> 23:24.780
 And allowing yourself to pursue that passion,

23:24.780 --> 23:26.140
 pushing yourself to your limits,

23:26.140 --> 23:30.220
 to really take concrete steps

23:30.220 --> 23:33.220
 along your path towards that passion.

23:33.220 --> 23:34.620
 Yeah, there's mutual responsibility.

23:34.620 --> 23:35.540
 There's mutual accountability.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.380
 I mean, we're responsible as individuals

23:37.380 --> 23:39.980
 to find the organizations and find the leaders

23:39.980 --> 23:41.180
 that inspire us.

23:41.180 --> 23:43.420
 And organizations are responsible for maintaining

23:43.420 --> 23:46.380
 that flame and giving people who believe

23:46.380 --> 23:49.220
 what they believed, you know, a chance to contribute.

23:50.580 --> 23:51.780
 Sort of to linger on it,

23:51.780 --> 23:54.020
 have you by chance seen the movie Whiplash?

23:54.020 --> 23:54.860
 Yes.

23:56.500 --> 23:59.380
 Again, maybe I'm romanticizing suffering.

23:59.380 --> 24:00.420
 Again. It's the Russian in you.

24:00.420 --> 24:01.660
 It's the Russian. Yeah.

24:01.660 --> 24:03.380
 The Russians love suffering.

24:03.380 --> 24:07.660
 But for people who haven't seen,

24:07.660 --> 24:10.860
 the movie Whiplash has a drum instructor

24:10.860 --> 24:15.860
 that pushes the drum musician to his limits

24:16.540 --> 24:18.660
 to bring out the best in him.

24:18.660 --> 24:20.420
 And there's a toxic nature to it.

24:20.420 --> 24:21.780
 There's suffering in it.

24:21.780 --> 24:24.300
 Like you've worked with a lot of great leaders,

24:24.300 --> 24:25.500
 a lot of great individuals.

24:25.500 --> 24:29.380
 So is that toxic relationship as toxic

24:29.380 --> 24:30.460
 as it appears in the movie?

24:30.460 --> 24:31.420
 Or is that fundamental?

24:31.420 --> 24:33.620
 I've seen that relationship,

24:33.620 --> 24:36.420
 especially in the past with Olympic athletes,

24:36.420 --> 24:39.780
 especially in athletics, extreme performers

24:39.780 --> 24:40.860
 seem to do wonders.

24:40.860 --> 24:42.060
 It does wonders for me.

24:42.060 --> 24:44.900
 There's some of my best relationships,

24:44.900 --> 24:47.660
 now I'm not representative of everyone certainly,

24:47.660 --> 24:51.100
 but some of my best relationships for mentee and mentor

24:51.100 --> 24:54.900
 have been toxic from an external perspective.

24:56.420 --> 24:57.700
 What do you make of that movie?

24:57.700 --> 25:00.580
 What do you make of that kind of relationship?

25:00.580 --> 25:02.060
 That's not my favorite movie.

25:04.140 --> 25:06.940
 Okay, so you don't think that's a healthy,

25:06.940 --> 25:08.660
 you don't think that kind of relationship

25:08.660 --> 25:11.940
 is a great example of a great leader?

25:11.940 --> 25:13.060
 No, I think it's a short term strategy.

25:13.060 --> 25:13.900
 I mean, short term.

25:13.900 --> 25:15.460
 I mean, look, being hard on someone

25:15.460 --> 25:16.820
 is not the same as toxicity.

25:18.580 --> 25:20.020
 If you go to the Marine Corps,

25:21.900 --> 25:26.140
 a drill instructor will be very hard on their Marines.

25:26.140 --> 25:29.500
 And then, but still, even on the last day of bootcamp,

25:29.500 --> 25:32.020
 they'll take their hat off and they'll become a human.

25:32.020 --> 25:34.820
 But of all the drill instructors,

25:34.820 --> 25:38.740
 you know, the three or four main drill instructors

25:38.740 --> 25:40.500
 assigned to a group of recruits,

25:40.500 --> 25:42.100
 the one that they all want the respect of

25:42.100 --> 25:44.100
 is the one that's the hardest on them.

25:44.100 --> 25:45.820
 That's true.

25:45.820 --> 25:47.660
 And you hear, you know,

25:47.660 --> 25:48.660
 there's plenty of stories of people

25:48.660 --> 25:50.940
 who want to earn the respect of a hard parent

25:50.940 --> 25:52.060
 or a hard teacher.

25:53.100 --> 25:55.020
 But fundamental, that parent, that teacher,

25:55.020 --> 25:57.300
 that drill instructor has to believe in that person,

25:57.300 --> 25:58.620
 has to see potential in them.

25:58.620 --> 25:59.860
 It's not a formula,

25:59.860 --> 26:01.940
 which is if I'm hard on people, they'll do well,

26:01.940 --> 26:04.100
 which is there has to still be love.

26:04.100 --> 26:05.980
 It has to be done with absolute love.

26:05.980 --> 26:08.980
 And it has to be done responsibly.

26:08.980 --> 26:09.860
 I mean, some people can take

26:09.860 --> 26:11.780
 a little more pressure than others,

26:11.780 --> 26:13.860
 but it's not, I think it's irresponsible

26:13.860 --> 26:15.700
 to think of it as a formula

26:15.700 --> 26:19.460
 that if I'm just toxic at people, they will do well.

26:20.460 --> 26:21.820
 It depends on their personalities.

26:21.820 --> 26:23.900
 First of all, it works for some, but not all.

26:23.900 --> 26:27.540
 And second of all, it can't be done willy nilly.

26:27.540 --> 26:29.980
 It has to still be done with care and love.

26:29.980 --> 26:34.980
 And sometimes you can get equal or better results

26:36.220 --> 26:37.700
 without all of the toxicity.

26:37.700 --> 26:41.900
 So one of the, I guess toxicity on my part

26:41.900 --> 26:43.540
 was a really bad word to use,

26:43.540 --> 26:46.420
 but if we talk about what makes a good leader

26:46.420 --> 26:49.660
 and just look at an example in particular,

26:49.660 --> 26:51.220
 looking at Elon Musk,

26:51.220 --> 26:54.220
 he's known to push people to their limits

26:54.220 --> 26:59.220
 in a way that I think really challenges people

27:01.340 --> 27:03.060
 in a way they've never been challenged before

27:03.060 --> 27:04.420
 to do the impossible.

27:04.420 --> 27:07.300
 But it can really break people.

27:07.300 --> 27:11.260
 And jobs was hard and Amazon is hard.

27:11.260 --> 27:15.220
 But the thing that's important is none of them lie about it.

27:15.220 --> 27:16.420
 People ask me about Amazon all the time.

27:16.420 --> 27:18.780
 Like Jeff Bezos never lied about it.

27:18.780 --> 27:20.460
 Even the ones who like Amazon don't last

27:20.460 --> 27:22.860
 more than a couple of years before they burn out.

27:22.860 --> 27:25.340
 But when we're honest about the culture,

27:25.340 --> 27:26.620
 then it gives people the opportunity

27:26.620 --> 27:28.100
 who like to work in that kind of culture

27:28.100 --> 27:29.940
 to choose to work in that kind of culture,

27:29.940 --> 27:31.380
 as opposed to pretending and saying,

27:31.380 --> 27:34.500
 oh no, this is all, it's all lovey lovey here.

27:34.500 --> 27:37.260
 And then you show up and it's the furthest thing from it.

27:37.260 --> 27:41.420
 So, I mean, I think the reputations

27:41.420 --> 27:44.060
 of putting a lot of pressure on people to,

27:44.060 --> 27:48.780
 jobs was not an easy man to work for.

27:48.780 --> 27:50.940
 He pushed people, but everyone who worked there

27:50.940 --> 27:52.980
 was given the space to create and do things

27:52.980 --> 27:54.740
 that they would not have been able to do anywhere else

27:54.740 --> 27:56.980
 and work at a level that they didn't work anywhere else.

27:56.980 --> 27:58.740
 And jobs didn't have all the answers.

27:58.740 --> 28:02.100
 I mean, he pushed his people to come up with answers.

28:02.100 --> 28:05.820
 He wasn't just looking for people to execute his ideas.

28:07.460 --> 28:09.220
 And people did, people accomplished more

28:09.220 --> 28:12.300
 than they thought they were capable of, which is wonderful.

28:12.300 --> 28:15.660
 How do you, you're talking about the infinite game

28:16.500 --> 28:19.820
 and not thinking about too short term.

28:19.820 --> 28:22.860
 And yet you see some of the most brilliant people

28:22.860 --> 28:24.740
 in the world being pushed by Elam us

28:24.740 --> 28:27.060
 to accomplish some of the most incredible things.

28:27.060 --> 28:28.420
 When we're talking about autopilot,

28:28.420 --> 28:32.020
 when we're talking about some of the hardware engineering,

28:32.020 --> 28:35.180
 and they do some of the best work of their life

28:35.180 --> 28:37.340
 and then leave.

28:37.340 --> 28:40.300
 How do you balance that in terms of what it takes

28:40.300 --> 28:41.700
 to be a good leader,

28:41.700 --> 28:44.660
 what it takes to accomplish great things in your life?

28:44.660 --> 28:49.380
 So I think there's a difference between someone

28:49.380 --> 28:52.660
 who can get a lot out of people in the short term

28:52.660 --> 28:53.700
 and building an organization

28:53.700 --> 28:55.660
 that can sustain beyond any individual.

28:57.180 --> 28:58.060
 There's a difference.

28:58.060 --> 28:59.420
 When you say beyond any individual,

28:59.420 --> 29:03.020
 you mean beyond like if the leader dies.

29:03.020 --> 29:03.860
 Correct.

29:03.860 --> 29:05.540
 Like could Tesla continue to do what it's doing

29:05.540 --> 29:06.700
 without Elon Musk?

29:08.540 --> 29:10.700
 And you're perhaps implying,

29:10.700 --> 29:13.660
 which is a very interesting question that it cannot.

29:13.660 --> 29:15.100
 I don't know.

29:15.100 --> 29:16.420
 You know, the argument you're making

29:16.420 --> 29:20.140
 of this person who pushes everyone

29:20.140 --> 29:23.340
 arguably is not a repeatable model, right?

29:23.340 --> 29:25.780
 You know, is Apple the same without Steve Jobs

29:25.780 --> 29:28.260
 or is it slowly moving in a different direction?

29:29.860 --> 29:31.060
 Or has he established something

29:31.060 --> 29:34.060
 that could be resurrected with the right leader?

29:34.060 --> 29:35.700
 That was his dream, I think,

29:35.700 --> 29:39.940
 is to build an organization that lives on beyond them.

29:39.940 --> 29:40.780
 At least I remember reading that somewhere.

29:40.780 --> 29:44.340
 I think that's what a lot of leaders desire,

29:44.340 --> 29:47.340
 which is to create something that was bigger than them.

29:47.340 --> 29:51.500
 You know, most businesses, most entrepreneurial ventures

29:51.500 --> 29:54.900
 could not pass the school bus test,

29:54.900 --> 29:57.180
 which is if the founder was hit by a school bus,

29:57.180 --> 29:58.820
 would everyone continue the business without them

29:58.820 --> 30:01.140
 or would they all just go find jobs?

30:01.140 --> 30:04.820
 And the vast majority of companies would fail that test,

30:04.820 --> 30:08.300
 you know, especially in the entrepreneurial world

30:08.300 --> 30:11.020
 that if you take the inspired visionary leader away,

30:11.020 --> 30:12.380
 the whole thing collapses.

30:12.380 --> 30:13.660
 So is that a business

30:13.660 --> 30:15.940
 or is that just a force of personality?

30:15.940 --> 30:19.300
 And a lot of entrepreneurs, you know, face that reality,

30:19.300 --> 30:20.580
 which is they have to be in every meeting,

30:20.580 --> 30:24.100
 make every decision, you know, come up with every idea,

30:24.100 --> 30:25.860
 because if they don't, who will?

30:25.860 --> 30:27.380
 And the question is, is, well,

30:27.380 --> 30:29.340
 what have you done to build your bench?

30:31.100 --> 30:33.380
 Is it, it's not, sometimes it's ego,

30:33.380 --> 30:35.420
 the belief that only I can.

30:35.420 --> 30:39.700
 Sometimes it's just things got,

30:39.700 --> 30:43.660
 did so well for so long that just forgot.

30:43.660 --> 30:46.220
 And sometimes it's a failure

30:48.300 --> 30:51.860
 to build the training programs or hire the right people

30:51.860 --> 30:53.780
 that could replace you,

30:53.780 --> 30:56.100
 who are maybe smarter and better.

30:58.020 --> 31:01.500
 And browbeating people is only one strategy.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.500
 I don't think it's necessarily the only strategy,

31:03.500 --> 31:05.100
 nor is it always the best strategy.

31:05.100 --> 31:07.140
 I think people get to choose the cultures

31:07.140 --> 31:07.980
 they wanna work in.

31:07.980 --> 31:11.740
 This is why I think companies should be honest

31:12.860 --> 31:15.220
 about the kind of culture that they've created.

31:16.100 --> 31:18.100
 You know, I heard a story about Apple

31:18.100 --> 31:21.340
 where somebody came in from a big company,

31:21.340 --> 31:23.380
 you know, he had accomplished a lot

31:23.380 --> 31:26.220
 and his ego was very large

31:26.220 --> 31:28.420
 and he was going on about how he did this and he did that

31:28.420 --> 31:30.460
 and he did this and he did that.

31:30.460 --> 31:32.340
 And somebody from Apple said,

31:32.340 --> 31:34.580
 we don't care what you've done.

31:34.580 --> 31:36.420
 The question is, what are you gonna do?

31:36.420 --> 31:41.420
 And that's, you know, for somebody who wants to be pushed,

31:41.420 --> 31:44.500
 that's the place you go because you choose to be pushed.

31:45.620 --> 31:47.460
 Now, we all wanna be pushed to some degree,

31:47.460 --> 31:49.700
 you know, anybody who wants to, you know,

31:49.700 --> 31:50.740
 accomplish anything in this world

31:50.740 --> 31:51.980
 wants to be pushed to some degree,

31:51.980 --> 31:55.220
 whether it's through self pressure or external pressure

31:55.220 --> 31:57.700
 or, you know, public pressure, whatever it is.

31:59.860 --> 32:02.940
 But I think this whole idea of one size fits all

32:02.940 --> 32:05.740
 is a false narrative of how leadership works,

32:05.740 --> 32:08.580
 but what all leadership requires is creating an environment

32:08.580 --> 32:10.540
 in which people can work at their natural best.

32:10.540 --> 32:12.940
 But you have a sense that it's possible

32:12.940 --> 32:17.780
 to create a business where it lives on beyond you.

32:17.780 --> 32:19.740
 So if we look at now,

32:19.740 --> 32:21.820
 if we just look at this current moment,

32:21.820 --> 32:25.100
 I just recently talked to Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter,

32:25.100 --> 32:26.780
 and he's under a lot of pressure now.

32:26.780 --> 32:28.180
 I don't know if you're aware of the news

32:28.180 --> 32:31.700
 that he's being pushed out as a potential CEO of Twitter

32:31.700 --> 32:33.140
 because he's the CEO already

32:33.140 --> 32:35.180
 of an incredibly successful company

32:35.180 --> 32:39.180
 plus he wants to go to Africa to live a few months in Africa

32:39.180 --> 32:43.820
 to connect with the world that's outside of the Silicon Valley

32:43.820 --> 32:45.780
 and sort of, there's this idea,

32:45.780 --> 32:48.420
 well, can Twitter live without Jack?

32:48.420 --> 32:49.260
 We'll find out.

32:50.260 --> 32:55.260
 But you have a general, as a student of great leadership,

32:55.660 --> 32:57.540
 you have a general sense that it's possible.

32:57.540 --> 32:58.540
 Yeah, of course it's possible.

32:58.540 --> 33:01.660
 I mean, what Bill Gates built with Microsoft

33:01.660 --> 33:04.260
 may not have survived Steve Ballmer

33:04.260 --> 33:06.540
 if the company weren't so rich,

33:06.540 --> 33:11.260
 but Sachin Ardala is putting it back on track again.

33:11.260 --> 33:12.900
 It's become a visionary company again.

33:12.900 --> 33:14.060
 It's attracting great talent again.

33:14.060 --> 33:14.900
 It went through a period

33:14.900 --> 33:16.500
 where they couldn't get the best talent

33:16.500 --> 33:17.860
 and the best talent was leaving.

33:17.860 --> 33:19.660
 Now people wanna work for Microsoft again.

33:19.660 --> 33:21.900
 Well, that's not because of pressure.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.340
 Ballmer put more pressure on people

33:24.340 --> 33:26.940
 mainly to hit numbers than anything else.

33:26.940 --> 33:28.660
 That didn't work.

33:28.660 --> 33:30.500
 Yes. Right?

33:30.500 --> 33:31.980
 And so the question is,

33:31.980 --> 33:33.340
 what kind of pressure are we putting on people?

33:33.340 --> 33:35.580
 We're putting on pressure people to hit numbers

33:35.580 --> 33:38.140
 or hit arbitrary deadlines,

33:38.140 --> 33:39.420
 or we're putting on pressure on people

33:39.420 --> 33:41.900
 because we believe that they can do better work.

33:41.900 --> 33:44.340
 And the work that we're trying to do

33:44.340 --> 33:46.580
 is to advance a vision that's bigger than all of us.

33:46.580 --> 33:47.900
 And if you're gonna put pressure on people,

33:47.900 --> 33:49.700
 it better be for the right reason.

33:49.700 --> 33:50.940
 Like if you're gonna put pressure on me,

33:50.940 --> 33:52.460
 it better be for a worthwhile reason.

33:52.460 --> 33:54.300
 If it's just to hit a goal,

33:54.300 --> 33:55.900
 if it's just to hit some arbitrary date

33:55.900 --> 33:58.100
 or some arbitrary number or make a stock price

33:58.100 --> 34:01.060
 hit some target, you can keep it, I'm outta here.

34:01.060 --> 34:02.140
 But if you wanna put pressure on me

34:02.140 --> 34:06.900
 because we are brothers and sisters in arms

34:06.900 --> 34:09.020
 working to advance a cause bigger than ourselves,

34:09.020 --> 34:10.660
 that we believe whatever we're gonna build

34:10.660 --> 34:12.340
 will significantly contribute

34:12.340 --> 34:14.140
 to the greater good of society,

34:14.140 --> 34:16.220
 then go ahead, I'll take the pressure.

34:16.220 --> 34:17.380
 And if you look at the Apples

34:17.380 --> 34:22.380
 and if you look at the Elon Musk's,

34:23.060 --> 34:24.100
 the Jobs and the Elon Musk,

34:24.100 --> 34:26.060
 they fundamentally believed that what they were doing

34:26.060 --> 34:27.460
 would improve society.

34:27.460 --> 34:30.140
 And it was for the good of humankind.

34:31.140 --> 34:33.740
 And so the pressure, in other words,

34:33.740 --> 34:36.020
 what they were doing was more important,

34:36.020 --> 34:38.220
 more valuable than any individual on the team.

34:39.820 --> 34:41.140
 And so the pressure they put on people

34:41.140 --> 34:42.900
 served a greater good.

34:42.900 --> 34:45.620
 And so we looked to the left

34:45.620 --> 34:47.500
 and we looked to the right to each other and said,

34:47.500 --> 34:49.060
 we're in this together.

34:49.060 --> 34:51.540
 We accept this, we want this.

34:51.540 --> 34:54.820
 But if it's just pressure to hit a number

34:54.820 --> 34:59.100
 or make the widget move a little faster,

35:01.220 --> 35:02.380
 that's soul sucking.

35:03.540 --> 35:06.580
 That's not passion, that's stress.

35:06.580 --> 35:11.140
 And I think a lot of leaders confuse

35:11.140 --> 35:12.260
 that making people work hard

35:12.260 --> 35:13.900
 is not what makes them passionate.

35:15.060 --> 35:17.540
 Giving to them something to believe in

35:17.540 --> 35:20.860
 and work on is what drives passion.

35:20.860 --> 35:23.100
 And when you have that, then turning up the pressure

35:23.100 --> 35:26.580
 only brings people together,

35:26.580 --> 35:27.420
 drives them further.

35:27.420 --> 35:28.820
 If done the right way.

35:28.820 --> 35:30.740
 If done the right way.

35:30.740 --> 35:32.260
 Speaking of pressure,

35:32.260 --> 35:36.980
 I'm gonna give you 90 seconds to answer the last question,

35:36.980 --> 35:39.420
 which is if I told you that tomorrow

35:39.420 --> 35:41.140
 was your last day to live,

35:41.140 --> 35:42.860
 we talked about mortality,

35:42.860 --> 35:45.260
 sunrise to sunset, can you tell me,

35:45.260 --> 35:46.300
 can you take me through the day?

35:46.300 --> 35:48.460
 What do you think that day would involve?

35:48.460 --> 35:50.220
 You can't spend it with your family,

35:50.220 --> 35:52.060
 I told you as well.

35:52.060 --> 35:54.940
 I would probably want to fill all of my senses

35:54.940 --> 35:59.100
 with things that excite my senses.

35:59.100 --> 36:00.420
 I'd want to look at beautiful art.

36:00.420 --> 36:02.860
 I'd want to listen to beautiful music.

36:02.860 --> 36:04.900
 I'd want to taste incredible food.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.900
 I'd want to smell amazing tastes.

36:06.900 --> 36:11.900
 I'd want to touch something that's beautiful to touch.

36:14.100 --> 36:18.140
 I'd want all of my senses to just be consumed

36:19.180 --> 36:21.100
 with things that I find beautiful.

36:21.100 --> 36:23.260
 And you talked about this idea of

36:23.260 --> 36:24.780
 we don't do it often these days,

36:24.780 --> 36:27.380
 of just listening to music, turning off all the devices

36:27.380 --> 36:29.820
 and actually taking in and listening to music.

36:29.820 --> 36:31.740
 So as an addendum,

36:33.300 --> 36:34.500
 if we were to talk about music,

36:34.500 --> 36:36.420
 what song would you be blasting

36:36.420 --> 36:38.100
 on this last day you're alive?

36:38.100 --> 36:39.060
 Is it Led Zeppelin?

36:39.060 --> 36:39.900
 What are we talking about?

36:39.900 --> 36:40.740
 That I love.

36:40.740 --> 36:41.580
 No, no.

36:41.580 --> 36:42.940
 There's probably gonna be a Beatles song in there.

36:42.940 --> 36:45.100
 There'll definitely be some Beethoven in there.

36:46.460 --> 36:47.500
 The classics.

36:47.500 --> 36:48.340
 The classics.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.180
 Yeah, exactly.

36:49.180 --> 36:51.860
 Well, thank you so much for talking today.

36:51.860 --> 36:53.620
 Thank you for making time for it.

36:53.620 --> 36:55.420
 Under pressure, we made it happen.

36:55.420 --> 36:56.860
 It was great.

36:56.860 --> 36:58.420

37:29.100 --> 37:32.340
 There are only two ways to influence human behavior.

37:32.340 --> 37:35.460
 You can manipulate it or you can inspire it.

37:35.460 --> 37:48.460
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
