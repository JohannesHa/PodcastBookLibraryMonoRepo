00:00.000 --> 00:02.840
 The following is a conversation with Brian Greene,

00:02.840 --> 00:04.900
 theoretical physicist at Columbia

00:04.900 --> 00:08.120
 and author of many amazing books on physics,

00:08.120 --> 00:11.500
 including his latest, Until the End of Time,

00:11.500 --> 00:14.440
 Mind, Matter, and Our Search for Meaning

00:14.440 --> 00:16.880
 in an Evolving Universe.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.100
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:19.100 --> 00:21.180
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:21.180 --> 00:22.420
 in the description.

00:22.420 --> 00:26.260
 And now, here's my conversation with Brian Greene.

00:27.240 --> 00:29.940
 In your most recent book, Until the End of Time,

00:29.940 --> 00:32.620
 you quote Bertrand Russell from a debate he had

00:32.620 --> 00:34.880
 about God in 1948.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.080
 He says, quote,

00:37.560 --> 00:39.460
 "'So far as scientific evidence goes,

00:39.460 --> 00:42.340
 "'the universe has crawled by slow stages

00:42.340 --> 00:45.600
 "'to a somewhat pitiful result on this earth,

00:45.600 --> 00:48.820
 "'and is going to crawl by still more pitiful stages

00:48.820 --> 00:51.220
 "'to a condition of universal death.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.980
 "'If this is to be taken as evidence of purpose,

00:54.980 --> 00:57.680
 "'I can only say that the purpose is one

00:57.680 --> 00:59.520
 "'that does not appeal to me.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.220
 "'I see no reason, therefore,

01:01.220 --> 01:03.360
 "'to believe in any sort of God.'"

01:04.820 --> 01:06.980
 That's quite a depressing statement.

01:06.980 --> 01:09.900
 As you say, this is a bleak outlook on our universe

01:09.900 --> 01:12.380
 and the emergence of human consciousness.

01:12.380 --> 01:15.900
 So let me ask, what is the more hopeful perspective

01:15.900 --> 01:17.200
 to take on this story?

01:18.140 --> 01:19.860
 Well, I think the more hopeful perspective

01:19.860 --> 01:23.420
 is to more fully understand

01:25.060 --> 01:28.340
 what was driving Bertrand Russell to this perspective,

01:28.340 --> 01:32.700
 and then to see it within a broader context.

01:32.700 --> 01:34.700
 And really, that's, in some sense,

01:34.700 --> 01:37.500
 what my book, Until the End of Time, is all about.

01:37.500 --> 01:41.740
 But in brief, I would say that there's a lot of truth

01:41.740 --> 01:43.700
 to what Bertrand Russell was saying there.

01:43.700 --> 01:45.700
 When you look at the second law of thermodynamics,

01:45.700 --> 01:48.140
 which is the underlying scientific idea

01:48.140 --> 01:51.660
 that's driving this notion that everything's gonna wither,

01:51.660 --> 01:55.140
 decay, fall apart, yeah, that's true.

01:55.140 --> 01:57.240
 Second law of thermodynamics establishes

01:57.240 --> 02:00.900
 that disorder, entropy, in aggregate,

02:00.900 --> 02:02.620
 is always on the rise.

02:02.620 --> 02:05.980
 And that is indeed interpretable

02:05.980 --> 02:07.620
 as disintegration and destruction

02:07.620 --> 02:09.580
 over sufficiently long timescales.

02:09.580 --> 02:12.460
 But my view is, when you recognize

02:12.460 --> 02:14.980
 how special that makes us,

02:14.980 --> 02:18.560
 that we are these exquisitely ordered configurations

02:18.560 --> 02:22.100
 of particles that only will last for a blink of an eye

02:22.100 --> 02:25.420
 in cosmological time like terms,

02:25.420 --> 02:27.380
 the fact that we're here and we can do what we do,

02:27.380 --> 02:30.900
 to me, that's just really something

02:30.900 --> 02:34.180
 that inspires gratitude and wonder

02:34.180 --> 02:38.020
 and a sense of deep purpose

02:38.020 --> 02:42.100
 by virtue of being these unique collections of entities

02:42.100 --> 02:44.640
 that happen to rise up, look around,

02:44.640 --> 02:46.500
 and try to figure out where we are

02:46.500 --> 02:48.540
 and what the heck we should do with our time.

02:48.540 --> 02:51.740
 So it's not that I would disagree with Bertrand Russell

02:51.740 --> 02:56.740
 in terms of the basic physics and the basic unfolding,

02:58.260 --> 03:00.580
 but I think it's really a matter of the slant

03:00.580 --> 03:02.820
 that you take on what it means for us.

03:04.460 --> 03:06.700
 So maybe we'll skip around a bit,

03:06.700 --> 03:09.020
 but let me ask the biggest possible question then.

03:09.020 --> 03:10.260
 You said purpose.

03:10.260 --> 03:12.500
 So what's the meaning of it all then?

03:12.500 --> 03:17.500
 Is there a meaning to life that we can take from this,

03:17.500 --> 03:22.180
 from this brief emergence of complexity

03:22.180 --> 03:24.260
 that arises from simple things

03:24.260 --> 03:26.860
 and then goes into a heat death

03:26.860 --> 03:29.780
 that is once again returns to simple things

03:29.780 --> 03:33.040
 as the march of the second law of thermodynamics goes on?

03:33.040 --> 03:33.880
 I think there is,

03:33.880 --> 03:36.620
 but I don't think it's a universal answer.

03:36.620 --> 03:39.340
 And so I think throughout the ages,

03:39.340 --> 03:44.340
 there has been a kind of quest for some final way

03:44.340 --> 03:47.660
 of articulating meaning and purpose,

03:47.660 --> 03:50.540
 whether it's God, whether it's love,

03:50.540 --> 03:51.660
 whether it's companionship.

03:51.660 --> 03:53.700
 I mean, many people put forward different ways

03:53.700 --> 03:56.660
 of taking this question on,

03:56.660 --> 03:59.340
 and there is no one right answer

03:59.340 --> 04:04.340
 when you recognize deeply that the universe doesn't care.

04:05.060 --> 04:08.940
 There is nothing out there that is the final answer.

04:08.940 --> 04:11.860
 It's not as though we need a more powerful telescope

04:11.860 --> 04:14.940
 and somehow if we can look deeply into the universe,

04:14.940 --> 04:17.300
 all will become clear.

04:17.300 --> 04:18.980
 In fact, the deeper we've looked,

04:18.980 --> 04:21.420
 both literally and metaphorically,

04:21.420 --> 04:24.860
 into the universe and into the structure of reality,

04:24.860 --> 04:27.020
 the more it's become clear

04:27.020 --> 04:30.700
 that we are just a momentary byproduct

04:30.700 --> 04:35.700
 of laws of physics that don't have any emotional content.

04:36.220 --> 04:39.640
 They don't have any intrinsic sense of meaning or purpose.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.340
 And when you recognize that,

04:41.340 --> 04:43.860
 you realize that searching for the universal

04:43.860 --> 04:47.680
 for this kind of a question is a fool's errand.

04:47.680 --> 04:51.820
 Every individual has the capacity to make their own meaning,

04:51.820 --> 04:53.700
 to set their own purpose.

04:53.700 --> 04:57.860
 And that's not some platitude, that is what we are.

04:57.860 --> 04:59.780
 Because there is no fundamental answer,

04:59.780 --> 05:01.120
 it's what you make of it.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.180
 And however much that may sound like a hallmark card,

05:04.180 --> 05:09.120
 this really is the deep lesson of physics and science

05:09.120 --> 05:11.420
 more generally over the past few hundred years.

05:11.420 --> 05:14.700
 Well, there's some level where you can objectively say

05:14.700 --> 05:16.340
 that whatever we've got going on here,

05:16.340 --> 05:18.060
 it's kind of peculiar.

05:18.060 --> 05:23.060
 It's kind of special in terms of complexity.

05:23.340 --> 05:26.540
 And maybe you can even begin to measure it

05:26.540 --> 05:28.900
 and like come up with metrics

05:28.900 --> 05:31.560
 where whatever we've got going on on Earth,

05:31.560 --> 05:35.620
 these like interesting hierarchical complexities

05:35.620 --> 05:39.320
 that form more and more sophisticated biological system,

05:39.320 --> 05:40.760
 that seems kind of unique

05:40.760 --> 05:42.860
 when you look at the entire universe,

05:45.460 --> 05:48.460
 the observable part that we can see with our tools.

05:48.460 --> 05:50.620
 I mean, so I have to ask,

05:50.620 --> 05:52.840
 as you describe in your book once again,

05:53.900 --> 05:55.120
 Schrodinger wrote the book,

05:55.120 --> 05:59.180
 "'What is Life?' based on a few lectures he gave in 1944."

05:59.180 --> 06:02.700
 So let me ask the fundamental question here.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.540
 What is life?

06:04.540 --> 06:06.820
 This particular thing we've got going on here,

06:06.820 --> 06:08.260
 this pocket of complexity

06:08.260 --> 06:10.180
 that emerged from such simple things?

06:10.180 --> 06:11.620
 Yeah, it's a tough question.

06:11.620 --> 06:15.580
 I asked that question even to Richard Dawkins once,

06:15.580 --> 06:18.340
 and I already have my preconceived notion,

06:18.340 --> 06:20.020
 which he pretty much confirmed,

06:20.020 --> 06:24.900
 which is if one could give an answer to that question

06:24.900 --> 06:28.060
 that allowed you to sort of draw a line in the sand

06:28.060 --> 06:30.640
 between the not living and the living,

06:30.640 --> 06:34.020
 then perhaps we would have the insight that we yearn for

06:34.020 --> 06:36.460
 and trying to say, what is so special about life?

06:36.460 --> 06:39.260
 But the fact of the matter is, it's a continuum.

06:39.260 --> 06:41.180
 There's a continuum from the things

06:41.180 --> 06:44.100
 that we would typically call nonliving and animate

06:44.100 --> 06:46.660
 to the things that we obviously call animate

06:46.660 --> 06:49.780
 and full of the currents of life.

06:49.780 --> 06:51.780
 Somewhere in there,

06:51.780 --> 06:55.500
 it is a question of the complexity of the structure,

06:55.500 --> 07:00.300
 the ability of the structure to take in raw material

07:00.300 --> 07:04.000
 from the environment and process it through a metabolism

07:04.000 --> 07:07.260
 that allows the structure to extract energy

07:07.260 --> 07:10.980
 and to release entropy to the wider environment.

07:10.980 --> 07:15.100
 Somewhere in those collections of biological processes

07:15.100 --> 07:19.540
 is the necessity or the necessary ingredients

07:19.540 --> 07:20.580
 and processes for life,

07:20.580 --> 07:22.600
 but drawing that line in the sand

07:22.600 --> 07:25.540
 is not something that we're able to do,

07:25.540 --> 07:27.500
 but I would agree with you.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.020
 It's deeply peculiar.

07:30.940 --> 07:33.900
 It may in fact be unique,

07:33.900 --> 07:35.000
 but it may not.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.240
 It could be that the universe is such

07:38.240 --> 07:41.020
 that under fairly typical conditions,

07:41.020 --> 07:46.020
 a star that's a well ordered source of low entropy energy,

07:47.420 --> 07:49.120
 that's what the sun is,

07:49.120 --> 07:51.020
 together with a planet being bathed

07:51.020 --> 07:52.700
 by that low entropy energy,

07:52.700 --> 07:55.740
 together with a surface that has enough

07:55.740 --> 07:59.300
 of the raw constituents that we recognize

07:59.300 --> 08:03.140
 are fairly commonplace result of supernova explosions

08:03.140 --> 08:07.960
 where a star spews forth the result of the nuclear furnace

08:07.960 --> 08:09.260
 that is the core of a star.

08:09.260 --> 08:11.700
 It could be that all you need

08:11.700 --> 08:15.020
 are those fairly commonplace conditions

08:15.020 --> 08:17.020
 and maybe life naturally forms.

08:17.020 --> 08:19.400
 Look, the James Webb Space Telescope, right?

08:19.400 --> 08:21.780
 It's going up hopefully in December.

08:21.780 --> 08:23.760
 And one of the goals of that mission

08:23.760 --> 08:26.660
 is to look at atmospheres around distant planets

08:26.660 --> 08:30.460
 and perhaps come to some sense of how special

08:30.460 --> 08:35.460
 or not life or life as we know it is in the universe.

08:35.960 --> 08:39.060
 Which part of the story of life,

08:39.060 --> 08:40.700
 let's stick to Earth for a second,

08:40.700 --> 08:42.760
 do you think is the hardest?

08:42.760 --> 08:45.860
 If you were like a betting man,

08:45.860 --> 08:48.460
 which part is the hardest to make happen?

08:48.460 --> 08:50.180
 Is it the origin of life?

08:50.180 --> 08:52.500
 Again, we haven't drawn the line where,

08:52.500 --> 08:55.900
 as you say, the line between a rock and a rabbit.

08:55.900 --> 09:00.900
 That part, is it complex organisms,

09:01.180 --> 09:03.260
 like multicellular organisms?

09:03.260 --> 09:05.980
 Is it crawling out of the ocean

09:05.980 --> 09:09.380
 where the fish somehow figured out how to crawl around?

09:09.380 --> 09:12.960
 Is it then the us homo sapiens,

09:12.960 --> 09:16.460
 as we like to think of ourselves special and intelligent?

09:17.340 --> 09:18.920
 Or is it somewhere in between?

09:18.920 --> 09:23.500
 As you also talk about, again, very hard to know

09:23.500 --> 09:28.500
 at which point this consciousness emerge.

09:28.580 --> 09:31.940
 If you were to sort of took us a survey

09:31.940 --> 09:36.380
 and made bets about other Earth like planets in the universe,

09:36.380 --> 09:38.660
 where do you think they get stuck the most?

09:38.660 --> 09:40.380
 Well, I would certainly say if we're gonna go all the way

09:40.380 --> 09:42.420
 to conscious beings like ourselves,

09:42.420 --> 09:45.180
 I would put it at the onset of consciousness,

09:45.180 --> 09:47.620
 which again, I think is a continuum.

09:47.620 --> 09:50.920
 I don't think it is something that you can draw the line

09:50.920 --> 09:53.980
 in the sand, but there are obvious circumstances,

09:53.980 --> 09:56.020
 there are obvious creatures such as ourselves

09:56.020 --> 09:58.540
 where we do recognize a certain kind

09:58.540 --> 10:01.820
 of self reflective conscious awareness.

10:01.820 --> 10:05.640
 And if we think about what it would require

10:05.640 --> 10:10.640
 for a system of living beings to acquire consciousness,

10:10.980 --> 10:14.700
 I think that's probably the hardest part because look,

10:14.700 --> 10:18.780
 take Earth and recognize that weren't for,

10:18.780 --> 10:21.980
 some singular event 65 million years ago

10:21.980 --> 10:25.340
 where this large rock slams into planet Earth

10:25.340 --> 10:27.860
 and wipes out the dinosaurs,

10:27.860 --> 10:31.380
 maybe the dinosaurs would still rule the planet

10:31.380 --> 10:35.560
 and they may well have not developed

10:35.560 --> 10:38.900
 the kind of conscious awareness that we have.

10:38.900 --> 10:41.580
 So for billions of years on this planet,

10:41.580 --> 10:44.460
 there was life that didn't have the kind

10:44.460 --> 10:47.180
 of conscious awareness that we have.

10:47.180 --> 10:52.180
 And it was an accidental event in astrophysical history

10:52.340 --> 10:56.120
 that allowed a mammalian species like us

10:56.120 --> 10:58.260
 to ultimately be the end product.

10:58.260 --> 11:00.960
 And so, yeah, I could imagine there's a lot of life

11:00.960 --> 11:04.800
 out there, but perhaps none of it's wondering

11:04.800 --> 11:08.620
 what's the meaning of life or trying to make sense of it,

11:08.620 --> 11:11.260
 just going about its business of survival,

11:11.260 --> 11:13.620
 which of course is the dominant activity

11:13.620 --> 11:15.620
 that life on this planet has practiced.

11:15.620 --> 11:17.900
 We are a rare exception to that.

11:17.900 --> 11:20.020
 And I really appreciate that you lean into

11:20.020 --> 11:22.500
 some of these unanswerable questions from me today.

11:22.500 --> 11:25.400
 But the, so you think about consciousness,

11:25.400 --> 11:28.420
 not as like a phase shift, the binary zero one,

11:28.420 --> 11:33.340
 you think of it as a continuum that humans somehow

11:33.340 --> 11:37.500
 are maybe some of the most conscious beings on Earth.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.140
 So you're, so.

11:39.140 --> 11:40.800
 I mean, people will dispute that.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.680
 Yes, I mean, well, and it's a very hard argument.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.900
 People will dispute that, rocks probably

11:45.900 --> 11:47.220
 will stay quiet on the matter.

11:47.220 --> 11:48.780
 Maybe not, right?

11:48.780 --> 11:51.580
 For the moment, they're waiting for their opportunity.

11:51.580 --> 11:56.580
 But I agree that, look, even when you and I

11:57.780 --> 12:01.620
 look at each other, I am not fully convinced

12:01.620 --> 12:03.560
 that you're a conscious being, right?

12:03.560 --> 12:04.580
 I mean, I think that you are.

12:04.580 --> 12:05.420
 It's not to me.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.300
 I mean, your behavior is such that

12:07.300 --> 12:09.340
 that's the best explanation for what's going on.

12:09.340 --> 12:11.460
 But of course, we're all in the position

12:11.460 --> 12:16.460
 of only having direct awareness of our own conscious being.

12:16.460 --> 12:19.820
 And therefore, when it comes to other creatures in the world,

12:19.820 --> 12:21.700
 we're in a similar state of ignorance

12:21.700 --> 12:25.240
 regarding what's actually happening inside of their head,

12:25.240 --> 12:26.540
 if they have a head.

12:26.540 --> 12:30.340
 And so it's hard to know how singular we are,

12:30.340 --> 12:33.260
 but I would say based on the best available data

12:33.260 --> 12:34.920
 and the best explanations that we can make,

12:34.920 --> 12:36.580
 yeah, there is something special about us.

12:36.580 --> 12:39.500
 I don't think that there are fish walking around

12:39.500 --> 12:43.260
 and coming up with existentialism.

12:43.260 --> 12:46.820
 I don't know that there are dogs walking around

12:46.820 --> 12:48.260
 who've developed an understanding

12:48.260 --> 12:49.620
 of the general theory of relativity.

12:49.620 --> 12:50.840
 I mean, maybe we're wrong,

12:50.840 --> 12:52.740
 but that seems the best explanation.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.700
 What do you think is more special,

12:55.700 --> 12:57.940
 intelligence or consciousness?

12:57.940 --> 12:59.300
 I think consciousness.

12:59.300 --> 13:02.140
 And I think that there's a deep connection

13:02.140 --> 13:03.620
 between these ideas.

13:03.620 --> 13:06.000
 They are distinct, but they're deeply connected.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.020
 But look, I mean, to me and to, of course, many philosophers

13:10.020 --> 13:11.320
 who actually coined a name for this,

13:11.320 --> 13:13.060
 the hard problem of consciousness,

13:13.060 --> 13:14.460
 David Chalmers and others,

13:15.460 --> 13:17.780
 as a physicist, I look out at the world

13:17.780 --> 13:22.780
 and I see it's particles governed by physical law.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.620
 We can name them.

13:24.620 --> 13:27.800
 We got electrons, we got quarks

13:27.800 --> 13:29.920
 that come in various flavors and so forth.

13:29.920 --> 13:33.500
 We have a list of ingredients that science has revealed

13:33.500 --> 13:36.140
 and we have a list of laws that seemingly

13:36.140 --> 13:37.300
 govern those ingredients.

13:37.300 --> 13:41.300
 And nowhere in there is there even a hint

13:41.300 --> 13:45.700
 that when you put those particles together in the right way,

13:45.700 --> 13:48.260
 an inner world should turn on.

13:48.260 --> 13:52.060
 And it's not only that there's no hint, it's insane.

13:52.060 --> 13:53.700
 I mean, it's ridiculous.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.660
 How could it be that a thoughtless,

13:56.660 --> 14:00.180
 passionless, emotionless particle,

14:00.180 --> 14:03.180
 when grouped together with compatriots,

14:03.180 --> 14:07.300
 somehow can yield something so deeply foreign

14:07.300 --> 14:09.380
 to the nature of the ingredients themselves?

14:09.380 --> 14:12.900
 So answering that question,

14:12.900 --> 14:14.940
 I think is among the deepest

14:14.940 --> 14:17.900
 and most difficult questions that we face.

14:17.900 --> 14:22.900
 Do you think it is in fact a really hard problem?

14:23.500 --> 14:28.100
 Or is it possible, I think you mentioned in your book,

14:28.100 --> 14:30.060
 that it's just like almost like a side effect.

14:30.060 --> 14:33.220
 It's an emergent thing that's like, oh, it's nice.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.940
 It's like a nice little feature.

14:34.940 --> 14:35.780
 Yeah.

14:35.780 --> 14:38.380
 Well, I mean, when people use the phrase hard problem,

14:38.380 --> 14:40.840
 I mean, they mean in a somewhat technical sense

14:40.840 --> 14:44.780
 that it's trying to explain something

14:44.780 --> 14:47.660
 that seems fundamentally unavailable

14:47.660 --> 14:52.660
 to third party objective analysis, right?

14:53.180 --> 14:55.680
 I'm the only one that can get inside my head

14:55.680 --> 14:57.740
 and I can tell you a lot about what's happening

14:57.740 --> 14:59.580
 inside my head right now, it's reflected

14:59.580 --> 15:02.180
 in what I'm saying, and you can try to deduce things

15:02.180 --> 15:03.580
 about what's going on inside my head,

15:03.580 --> 15:06.300
 but you don't have access to it in the way that I do.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.100
 And so it seems like a fundamentally different

15:08.100 --> 15:12.260
 kind of problem from the ones that we have successfully

15:12.260 --> 15:14.240
 dealt with over the course of centuries in science,

15:14.240 --> 15:15.900
 where we look at the motion of the moon,

15:15.900 --> 15:18.300
 everybody can look, everybody can measure it.

15:18.300 --> 15:20.940
 We look at the properties of hydrogen

15:20.940 --> 15:22.660
 when you shine lasers on it,

15:22.660 --> 15:25.900
 everybody can look at the data and understand it.

15:25.900 --> 15:29.020
 And so it seems like a fundamentally different problem

15:29.020 --> 15:32.340
 in that sense, it seems like it is hard

15:32.340 --> 15:35.900
 relative to the others, but I do think ultimately

15:35.900 --> 15:38.980
 that the explanation will be, as you recount,

15:38.980 --> 15:41.140
 I think that a hundred years from now,

15:41.140 --> 15:43.020
 or maybe it's a thousand, it's hard to predict

15:43.020 --> 15:45.520
 the timescale for developments,

15:45.520 --> 15:48.420
 but I think we'll get to a place where we'll look back

15:48.420 --> 15:53.300
 and kind of smile at those folks in the 20th century

15:53.300 --> 15:55.340
 and before, 21st century and before,

15:55.340 --> 15:59.340
 who thought consciousness was so incredibly mysterious

15:59.340 --> 16:03.820
 when the reality of it is, eh, it's just a thing that happens

16:03.820 --> 16:05.800
 when particles come together.

16:05.800 --> 16:10.420
 And however mysterious that feels right now,

16:10.420 --> 16:12.140
 I think for instance, when we start to build

16:12.140 --> 16:15.540
 conscious systems, things that you're more familiar with

16:15.540 --> 16:19.420
 than I am, when we start to build these artificial systems

16:19.420 --> 16:23.220
 and those systems report to us, I'm feeling sad,

16:23.220 --> 16:25.500
 I'm feeling anxious, yeah, there's a world going on

16:25.500 --> 16:28.580
 inside here, I think the mystery of consciousness

16:28.580 --> 16:30.860
 will just begin to evaporate.

16:30.860 --> 16:33.460
 Well, that's, first of all, beautifully put,

16:33.460 --> 16:35.220
 and I agree with you completely,

16:35.220 --> 16:38.500
 just the way you said it, it'll begin to evaporate.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.260
 I have built quite a few robots

16:41.260 --> 16:46.260
 and have had them do emotion, emotional type things,

16:47.220 --> 16:49.380
 and it's immediate that exactly what you're saying,

16:49.380 --> 16:52.600
 this kind of mystery of consciousness starts to evaporate,

16:52.600 --> 16:57.600
 that the kind of need to truly understand,

16:57.620 --> 17:00.380
 to solve the hard problem of consciousness disappears,

17:00.380 --> 17:05.060
 because, well, I don't really care if I understand

17:05.060 --> 17:07.300
 what can solve the hard problem of consciousness.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.660
 That thing sure as heck looks conscious.

17:09.660 --> 17:12.840
 I feel like that way when I interact with a dog.

17:12.840 --> 17:16.420
 I don't need to solve the problem of consciousness

17:16.420 --> 17:21.420
 to be able to interact and richly enjoy the experience

17:22.740 --> 17:24.380
 with this other living being.

17:24.380 --> 17:26.440
 Obviously, same thing with other humans.

17:26.440 --> 17:27.940
 I don't need to fully understand it.

17:27.940 --> 17:31.020
 And there's some aspect, maybe this is a little bit

17:31.020 --> 17:33.540
 too engineering focused, but there's some aspect

17:33.540 --> 17:37.780
 in which it feels like consciousness is just a nice trick

17:38.660 --> 17:41.740
 to help us communicate with each other.

17:41.740 --> 17:46.740
 It sounds ridiculous to say, but sort of the ability

17:47.540 --> 17:51.220
 to experience the world is very useful,

17:51.220 --> 17:55.160
 in a subjective sense, is very useful to put yourself

17:55.160 --> 17:58.340
 in that world and to be able to describe the experience

17:58.340 --> 17:59.180
 to others.

17:59.180 --> 18:01.840
 It could be just a social and the merge.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.500
 Obviously, animals, the sort of more primitive animals

18:04.500 --> 18:08.780
 might experience consciousness in some more primitive way,

18:08.780 --> 18:12.300
 but this kind of rich, subjective experience

18:12.300 --> 18:14.540
 that we think about as humans, I think it's probably

18:14.540 --> 18:17.840
 deeply coupled with language and poetry.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.680
 Yeah, that resonates with my view as well.

18:20.680 --> 18:23.340
 I mean, there's a scientist, maybe you've spoken to him,

18:23.340 --> 18:25.140
 Michael Graziano from Princeton.

18:25.140 --> 18:29.620
 Yeah, he's developed ideas of consciousness that,

18:29.620 --> 18:31.620
 look, I don't think they solve the problem,

18:31.620 --> 18:34.340
 but I think they do illuminate it in an interesting way

18:34.340 --> 18:39.020
 where basically we are not aware

18:39.020 --> 18:43.060
 of all the underlying physiochemical processes

18:43.060 --> 18:45.900
 that make our brains and our inner worlds

18:45.900 --> 18:48.020
 tick the way they do.

18:48.020 --> 18:52.220
 And because of that dissociation between sensation

18:52.220 --> 18:55.140
 and the physics of it and the chemistry of it

18:55.140 --> 18:58.900
 and the biology of it, it feels like our minds

18:58.900 --> 19:00.960
 and our inner worlds are just untethered,

19:00.960 --> 19:04.640
 like floating somewhere in this gray matter

19:04.640 --> 19:06.500
 inside of our heads.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.580
 And the way I like to think of it is like,

19:08.580 --> 19:13.580
 look, if you were in a dark room, right,

19:13.980 --> 19:17.380
 and I had glow in the dark paint on my fingers,

19:17.380 --> 19:20.380
 so all you saw was my fingers dancing around,

19:20.380 --> 19:21.980
 there'd be something mysterious.

19:21.980 --> 19:24.460
 How could those fingers be doing that?

19:24.460 --> 19:25.300
 And then you turn on the light, you realize,

19:25.300 --> 19:27.700
 oh, there's this arm underlying it,

19:27.700 --> 19:30.660
 and that's the deep physical connection explains it all.

19:30.660 --> 19:32.620
 And I think that's what we're missing,

19:32.620 --> 19:35.800
 the deep physical connection between what's happening

19:35.800 --> 19:38.540
 up here and what is responsible for it

19:38.540 --> 19:41.420
 in a physical, chemical, biological way.

19:41.420 --> 19:43.660
 And so to me, that at least gives me some understanding

19:43.660 --> 19:46.740
 of why consciousness feels so mysterious

19:46.740 --> 19:51.580
 because we are suppressing all of the underlying science

19:51.580 --> 19:53.540
 that ultimately is responsible for it.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.940
 And one day we will reveal that more fully,

19:55.940 --> 19:59.260
 and I think that will help us tether this experience

19:59.260 --> 20:01.540
 to something quite tangible in the world.

20:01.540 --> 20:06.540
 I wonder if the mystery is an important component

20:08.140 --> 20:10.120
 of enjoying something.

20:10.120 --> 20:14.180
 So once we know how this thing works,

20:14.180 --> 20:19.180
 maybe we will no longer enjoy this conversation.

20:19.220 --> 20:21.260
 We'll seek other sources of enjoyment,

20:21.260 --> 20:25.340
 but this is, again, from an engineering perspective,

20:25.340 --> 20:29.020
 I wonder if the mystery is an important component.

20:29.020 --> 20:31.580
 Well, have you ever seen,

20:31.580 --> 20:33.500
 there's this beautiful interview

20:33.500 --> 20:36.940
 that Richard Feynman did,

20:36.940 --> 20:39.620
 great Nobel laureate physicist responsible

20:39.620 --> 20:42.060
 for a lot of our understanding of quantum mechanics,

20:42.060 --> 20:43.060
 quantum field theory and so forth.

20:43.060 --> 20:46.520
 And he was in a conversation with an interviewer

20:46.520 --> 20:48.580
 where he noted that some people feel

20:48.580 --> 20:51.060
 like once the mystery is gone,

20:51.060 --> 20:53.400
 once science explains something,

20:55.900 --> 20:58.300
 the beauty goes away, the wonder of it goes away.

20:58.300 --> 21:02.060
 And he was emphasizing in his response to that,

21:02.060 --> 21:05.060
 he's like, no, that's not the right way of thinking about it.

21:05.060 --> 21:06.840
 He says, look, when I look at a rose,

21:07.700 --> 21:11.540
 he says, yeah, I can still deeply enjoy the aroma,

21:11.540 --> 21:13.940
 the color, the texture.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.920
 He says, but what I can do that you can't,

21:15.920 --> 21:16.820
 if you're not a physicist,

21:16.820 --> 21:19.340
 I can look more deeply and understand

21:19.340 --> 21:21.520
 where the red comes from, where the aroma comes from,

21:21.520 --> 21:22.740
 where the structure comes from.

21:22.740 --> 21:27.740
 He says, that only augments my wonder.

21:27.740 --> 21:29.900
 It only augments my experience.

21:29.900 --> 21:32.580
 It doesn't flatten it or take away from it.

21:32.580 --> 21:37.580
 So I sort of take that as a bit of a motto in some sense

21:38.780 --> 21:43.780
 that there is a wonder that comes from a kind of ignorance.

21:43.820 --> 21:45.740
 And I don't mean that in a derogatory sense,

21:45.740 --> 21:47.280
 but just from not knowing.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.700
 So there is a wonder that comes from mystery.

21:49.700 --> 21:53.500
 There's another kind of wonder that comes from knowing

21:53.500 --> 21:55.860
 and deep knowing.

21:55.860 --> 21:59.260
 And I think that kind of wonder has its own

21:59.260 --> 22:03.140
 special character that in some ways can be more gratifying.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.080
 I hope he's right.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.460
 I hope you're right.

22:07.460 --> 22:10.300
 But there's also, I remember he said something

22:10.300 --> 22:13.940
 about like science is an onion or something like that.

22:13.940 --> 22:16.540
 You can peel back, you can keep peeling back.

22:16.540 --> 22:19.580
 I mean, there is also, when you understand something,

22:19.580 --> 22:22.060
 there's always a sense that there's more mystery

22:22.060 --> 22:23.380
 to understand.

22:23.380 --> 22:27.060
 Like you never get to the bottom of the mystery.

22:27.060 --> 22:28.780
 But I think it's also different than,

22:28.780 --> 22:31.460
 you know, I don't think you can analogize say

22:31.460 --> 22:33.620
 to a magician, right?

22:33.620 --> 22:35.360
 A magician does some trick.

22:35.360 --> 22:37.780
 You learn how it sounds like, oh my God,

22:37.780 --> 22:39.520
 that's ridiculous when you find.

22:39.520 --> 22:42.780
 But nature is perhaps the best magician

22:42.780 --> 22:45.060
 if you wanna try to make the analogy there

22:45.060 --> 22:48.860
 because when you peel things back and you understand

22:48.860 --> 22:53.220
 how it is that things have color and you have electrons,

22:53.220 --> 22:56.420
 dancing from one orbital to another,

22:56.420 --> 22:59.220
 emitting photons at very particular wavelengths

22:59.220 --> 23:01.900
 that are described by these beautiful equations

23:01.900 --> 23:03.460
 of quantum electrodynamics,

23:03.460 --> 23:06.100
 part of which that Feynman developed,

23:06.100 --> 23:09.460
 it gives you a greater sense of awe

23:09.460 --> 23:11.700
 when the curtain is pulled back

23:11.700 --> 23:14.340
 than what happens in other circumstances

23:14.340 --> 23:16.380
 where it does flatten it completely.

23:16.380 --> 23:18.540
 Yeah, it's very possible then say in physics

23:18.540 --> 23:21.400
 that we arrive at a theory of everything

23:21.400 --> 23:23.460
 that unifies the laws of physics

23:23.460 --> 23:25.000
 and has a very strong understanding

23:25.000 --> 23:26.540
 of the fabric of reality,

23:26.540 --> 23:30.380
 even like from the big bang to today,

23:30.380 --> 23:33.000
 it's possible that that understanding

23:33.000 --> 23:36.520
 is only going to elevate our appreciation

23:36.520 --> 23:37.360
 of this whole thing.

23:37.360 --> 23:38.260
 Yeah, I think it will.

23:38.260 --> 23:39.100
 I think it will.

23:39.100 --> 23:40.980
 I mean, I think it has so far.

23:40.980 --> 23:43.380
 But the other side of it which you emphasize

23:43.380 --> 23:48.380
 is it's not like science somehow reaches an end, right?

23:48.380 --> 23:50.700
 There are certain categories of questions

23:50.700 --> 23:52.260
 that do reach an end.

23:52.260 --> 23:54.340
 I think we one day will close the book

23:54.340 --> 23:57.500
 on nature's ingredients and the fundamental laws.

23:57.500 --> 23:58.900
 Now that we can't prove that,

23:58.900 --> 24:01.660
 maybe it goes on forever, smaller and smaller,

24:01.660 --> 24:03.140
 maybe there are deeper and deeper laws,

24:03.140 --> 24:03.980
 but I don't think so.

24:03.980 --> 24:06.180
 I think that there's going to be a collection

24:06.180 --> 24:08.620
 of ingredients and a collection of basic laws.

24:08.620 --> 24:12.940
 That chapter will close, but it's one chapter.

24:12.940 --> 24:16.220
 Now we take that knowledge and we try to understand

24:16.220 --> 24:19.740
 how the world builds the structures that it does,

24:19.740 --> 24:23.380
 from planets to people to black holes

24:23.380 --> 24:25.640
 to the possibility of other universes

24:25.640 --> 24:27.700
 and every step of the way,

24:27.700 --> 24:29.580
 the collection of questions

24:29.580 --> 24:32.300
 that we don't know the answer to only blossoms.

24:32.300 --> 24:36.760
 And so there's a deep sense of gratification

24:36.760 --> 24:39.020
 from understanding certain qualities of the world.

24:39.020 --> 24:42.500
 But I would say that if you take a ratio

24:42.500 --> 24:45.780
 of what we understand to the things that we know

24:45.780 --> 24:47.680
 that we don't yet understand,

24:47.680 --> 24:50.020
 that ratio keeps getting smaller and smaller

24:50.020 --> 24:52.140
 because the things that we know that we don't understand

24:52.140 --> 24:53.340
 grows larger and larger.

24:54.300 --> 24:56.980
 Do you have a hope that we solve that theory

24:56.980 --> 25:00.180
 of everything puzzle in the next few decades?

25:00.180 --> 25:03.820
 So there's been a bunch of attempts from string theory

25:03.820 --> 25:07.500
 to all kinds of attempts at trying to solve quantum gravity

25:07.500 --> 25:10.260
 or basically come up with a theory for quantum gravity.

25:10.260 --> 25:13.260
 There's a lot of complexities to this.

25:13.260 --> 25:16.260
 One, for experimental validation,

25:16.260 --> 25:17.820
 you have to observe effects

25:17.820 --> 25:20.420
 that are very difficult to measure.

25:20.420 --> 25:21.340
 So you have to build,

25:21.340 --> 25:23.660
 like that's like an engineering challenge.

25:23.660 --> 25:25.260
 And then there's the theory challenge,

25:25.260 --> 25:28.380
 which is like, it seems very difficult

25:28.380 --> 25:31.820
 to connect the laws of gravity to quantum mechanics.

25:31.820 --> 25:35.500
 Do you have a hope or are we hopelessly stuck?

25:35.500 --> 25:37.620
 Well, I have to have to have a hope.

25:37.620 --> 25:39.640
 I mean, it's in some sense,

25:39.640 --> 25:43.660
 but I devote at least part of my professional life toward

25:43.660 --> 25:45.020
 trying to make progress on.

25:45.020 --> 25:47.540
 And I'm glad you used the phrase quantum gravity.

25:47.540 --> 25:50.300
 I'm not a great fan of the theory of everything phrase

25:50.300 --> 25:53.320
 because it does make other scientists feel like

25:53.320 --> 25:55.620
 if they're not working on this, what are they working on?

25:55.620 --> 25:57.500
 Man's like, there's not much left

25:57.500 --> 25:58.860
 when you're talking about theory of everything.

25:58.860 --> 26:01.460
 Biology is just small details we'll figure out.

26:01.460 --> 26:04.180
 Yeah, so it is really trying to put gravity

26:04.180 --> 26:06.180
 and quantum mechanics together.

26:06.180 --> 26:08.580
 And since I was a college kid,

26:08.580 --> 26:12.980
 I was deeply fascinated with gravity.

26:12.980 --> 26:15.480
 And as I learned quantum mechanics,

26:15.480 --> 26:19.000
 the notion of physicists being stumped

26:19.000 --> 26:20.560
 and trying to blend them together,

26:20.560 --> 26:22.260
 how could one not get fired up

26:22.260 --> 26:25.940
 about maybe contributing something to that journey?

26:25.940 --> 26:27.660
 And so we've been on this,

26:27.660 --> 26:29.820
 I've been on this for 30 years since I was a student.

26:29.820 --> 26:31.800
 We have made progress.

26:31.800 --> 26:32.860
 We do have ideas.

26:32.860 --> 26:36.240
 You mentioned string theory is one possible scenario.

26:36.240 --> 26:37.520
 It's not stuck.

26:37.520 --> 26:40.900
 String theory is a vibrant field of research

26:40.900 --> 26:43.600
 that is making incredible progress,

26:43.600 --> 26:45.980
 but we've not made progress

26:45.980 --> 26:49.460
 on this issue of experimental verification validation,

26:49.460 --> 26:53.940
 which is, you know, it is a vital part of the story.

26:53.940 --> 26:55.740
 So I would have hoped that by now

26:55.740 --> 26:58.620
 we would have made contact with observation.

26:58.620 --> 27:01.620
 If you would have interviewed me back in the 80s

27:01.620 --> 27:04.940
 when I was, you know, a wild bright eyed kid

27:04.940 --> 27:07.140
 trying to make headway working 18 hours a day

27:07.140 --> 27:07.980
 and this sort of stuff,

27:07.980 --> 27:10.380
 I would have said, yeah, by 2021,

27:10.380 --> 27:12.160
 yeah, we're gonna know whether it's right or wrong.

27:12.160 --> 27:13.620
 We'll have made contact.

27:13.620 --> 27:14.460
 I would have said, look,

27:14.460 --> 27:16.020
 there may be certain mathematical puzzles

27:16.020 --> 27:17.220
 that we've yet to work out,

27:17.220 --> 27:19.900
 but we'll know enough to make contact with experiment.

27:19.900 --> 27:21.580
 That has not happened.

27:21.580 --> 27:22.540
 On the other hand,

27:22.540 --> 27:25.200
 if you would have interviewed me back then and asked me,

27:25.200 --> 27:29.140
 will we be able to talk about detailed qualities

27:29.140 --> 27:34.140
 of black holes and understand them at the level of detail

27:34.140 --> 27:37.460
 that we actually, I would have said,

27:37.460 --> 27:39.820
 no, I don't think that we're gonna be able to do that.

27:39.820 --> 27:42.660
 Will we have an exact formulation of string theory

27:42.660 --> 27:43.980
 in certain circumstances?

27:43.980 --> 27:46.600
 No, I don't think we're gonna have that, and yet we do.

27:46.600 --> 27:47.440
 So it's just to say,

27:47.440 --> 27:51.020
 you don't know where the progress is going to happen,

27:51.020 --> 27:52.980
 but yes, I do hold out hope

27:52.980 --> 27:56.740
 that maybe before I move on to wherever,

27:56.740 --> 27:58.100
 I don't think there is an after,

27:58.100 --> 28:01.780
 but I would love before I leave this earth

28:01.780 --> 28:06.780
 to know the answer, but science and the universe,

28:06.900 --> 28:11.620
 it's not about pleasing any individual, it is what it is.

28:11.620 --> 28:15.000
 And so we just press onward and we'll see where it goes.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.100
 So in terms of string theory,

28:17.100 --> 28:20.400
 if I just look from an authoritative perspective currently

28:20.400 --> 28:22.480
 at the theoretical physics community,

28:22.480 --> 28:26.500
 string theory as a theory has been very popular

28:26.500 --> 28:30.700
 for a few decades, but has recently fallen out of favor,

28:30.700 --> 28:32.940
 or at least there's been like, you know,

28:32.940 --> 28:36.980
 it became more popular to kind of ask the question,

28:36.980 --> 28:39.380
 is string theory really the answer?

28:39.380 --> 28:40.900
 Where do you fall on this?

28:40.900 --> 28:43.220
 Like, how do you make sense of this puzzle?

28:43.220 --> 28:45.480
 Why do you think it's fallen out of favor?

28:45.480 --> 28:47.900
 Yeah, so I would actually challenge the statement

28:47.900 --> 28:50.300
 that it's fallen out of favor.

28:50.300 --> 28:55.180
 I would say that any field of research when it's new

28:55.180 --> 28:58.740
 and it's the bright, shiny bicycle

28:58.740 --> 29:01.060
 that no one has yet seen on that block,

29:01.060 --> 29:03.060
 yeah, it's gonna attract attention

29:03.060 --> 29:06.100
 and the news outlets are gonna cover it

29:06.100 --> 29:09.200
 and students are gonna flock to it, sure.

29:09.200 --> 29:14.200
 But as a field matures, it does shed those qualities

29:14.260 --> 29:17.260
 because it's no longer as novel as it was

29:17.260 --> 29:20.340
 when it was first introduced 30, 40 years ago,

29:20.340 --> 29:22.660
 but you need to judge it by a different standard.

29:22.660 --> 29:26.220
 You need to judge it by is it making progress

29:26.220 --> 29:29.380
 on foundational issues deepening our understanding

29:29.380 --> 29:31.620
 of the subject and by that measure,

29:31.620 --> 29:36.580
 string theory is scoring very high.

29:36.580 --> 29:39.280
 Now, at the same time, you also need to judge

29:39.280 --> 29:41.100
 whether it makes contact with experiment

29:41.100 --> 29:42.900
 as we discussed before too

29:42.900 --> 29:45.900
 and in that measure, we're still challenged.

29:45.900 --> 29:49.220
 So I would say that many string theorists,

29:49.220 --> 29:54.220
 myself included, are very sober about the theory.

29:54.220 --> 29:58.340
 It has the tremendous progress that it had 30, 40 years ago

29:58.340 --> 30:02.780
 that hasn't gone away, but we become better equipped

30:02.780 --> 30:06.700
 at assessing the long journey ahead

30:06.700 --> 30:09.580
 and that was something that we weren't particularly good at

30:09.580 --> 30:10.860
 back, say, in the 80s.

30:10.860 --> 30:13.900
 Look, when I was just starting out in the field,

30:13.900 --> 30:18.100
 there was a sense of physics is about to end.

30:18.100 --> 30:21.940
 String theory is about to be the be all and end all

30:21.940 --> 30:26.580
 final unified theory and that will bring this chapter

30:26.580 --> 30:27.780
 to a close.

30:27.780 --> 30:30.180
 Now, I have to say, I think it was more the younger

30:30.180 --> 30:31.840
 physicists who were saying that.

30:31.840 --> 30:32.900
 Some of them were seasoned,

30:32.900 --> 30:35.820
 even if they were pro string theory at the time.

30:35.820 --> 30:37.700
 I don't know if they were rolling their eyes,

30:37.700 --> 30:41.780
 but they knew that it was gonna be a long, long journey.

30:41.780 --> 30:43.860
 I think people like John Schwartz,

30:43.860 --> 30:45.180
 one of the founders of string theory,

30:45.180 --> 30:46.620
 Michael Green, no relation to me,

30:46.620 --> 30:49.660
 founders of the theory, Edward Witten,

30:49.660 --> 30:52.100
 one of the main people driving the theory

30:52.100 --> 30:53.900
 back then and today.

30:53.900 --> 30:58.900
 I think they knew that we were in for a long haul

30:58.900 --> 31:01.780
 and that's the nature of science,

31:01.780 --> 31:06.180
 quick hits that resolve everything few and far between.

31:06.180 --> 31:11.180
 And so if you were in for the quick solution

31:12.220 --> 31:13.860
 to the big questions of the world,

31:13.860 --> 31:15.100
 then you would have been disappointed

31:15.100 --> 31:16.820
 and I think there were people who were disappointed

31:16.820 --> 31:19.740
 and moved on and work on other subjects.

31:19.740 --> 31:23.340
 If you're in in the way that Einstein was in

31:23.340 --> 31:26.860
 for a lifetime of investigation to try to see

31:27.780 --> 31:30.660
 what the answers to the deep questions would be,

31:30.660 --> 31:33.860
 then I think string theory has been a rich source

31:33.860 --> 31:38.860
 of material that has kept so many people deeply engaged

31:39.100 --> 31:41.300
 in moving the frontier forward.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.020
 There's a few qualities about string theory,

31:43.020 --> 31:45.140
 which are weird.

31:45.140 --> 31:48.940
 I mean, a lot of physics is just weird and beautiful.

31:48.940 --> 31:50.220
 So let me ask the question,

31:50.220 --> 31:53.140
 what do you use most beautiful about string theory?

31:53.140 --> 31:57.900
 Well, what attracted me to the theory at the outset

31:57.900 --> 32:00.980
 beyond it's putting gravity and quantum mechanics together,

32:00.980 --> 32:03.940
 which I think is its true claim to fame,

32:03.940 --> 32:06.740
 at least on paper, it's able to do that.

32:06.740 --> 32:08.260
 What attracted me to the theory was the fact

32:08.260 --> 32:11.140
 that it requires extra dimensions of space.

32:11.140 --> 32:16.140
 And this was an idea that intrigued me in a very deep way,

32:16.900 --> 32:20.620
 even before I really understood what it meant.

32:20.620 --> 32:24.020
 I somehow had, I mean, talk about sort of

32:24.020 --> 32:27.180
 the emotional part of consciousness and the cognitive part

32:27.180 --> 32:29.460
 in some, perhaps you call it strange,

32:29.460 --> 32:31.940
 in some strange emotional way,

32:31.940 --> 32:35.420
 I was enamored with Einstein's general relativity,

32:35.420 --> 32:37.740
 the idea of curved space and time

32:37.740 --> 32:39.420
 before I really knew what it meant.

32:39.420 --> 32:43.300
 It just spoke to me, I don't know how else to say it.

32:43.300 --> 32:46.620
 And then when I subsequently learned

32:46.620 --> 32:49.620
 that people had thought about more dimensions of space

32:49.620 --> 32:52.380
 than we can see and how those extra dimensions

32:52.380 --> 32:55.060
 would be vital to a deep understanding

32:55.060 --> 32:56.900
 of the things that we do see in this world,

32:56.900 --> 32:59.740
 four, five, six dimensions might explain

32:59.740 --> 33:01.740
 why there are certain forces and particles

33:01.740 --> 33:03.340
 and how they behave.

33:03.340 --> 33:06.300
 To me, this was like amazing, utterly amazing.

33:06.300 --> 33:09.060
 And then when I learned that string theory

33:09.060 --> 33:10.700
 embraced all these ideas,

33:10.700 --> 33:12.500
 embraced the general theory of relativity,

33:12.500 --> 33:13.620
 embraced quantum mechanics,

33:13.620 --> 33:16.300
 embraced the possibility of extra dimensions,

33:17.260 --> 33:19.140
 then I was hooked.

33:19.140 --> 33:21.460
 And so when I was a graduate student,

33:21.460 --> 33:23.780
 we would just spend hours,

33:23.780 --> 33:26.260
 we, I mean, a couple of other graduate students and myself

33:26.260 --> 33:29.300
 who had sort of worked really well together,

33:29.300 --> 33:30.940
 it was at Oxford in England,

33:30.940 --> 33:33.900
 we would work these enormous numbers of hours a day

33:33.900 --> 33:36.340
 trying to understand the shapes of these extra dimensions,

33:36.340 --> 33:39.820
 the geometry of them, what those geometrical shapes

33:39.820 --> 33:41.460
 for the extra dimensions would imply

33:41.460 --> 33:43.780
 for things that we see in the world around us.

33:43.780 --> 33:46.660
 And it was a heady, heady time.

33:46.660 --> 33:50.500
 And that kind of excitement has sort of filtered through

33:50.500 --> 33:51.420
 over the decades.

33:51.420 --> 33:56.420
 But I'd say that's really the part of the theory

33:57.020 --> 33:59.420
 that I think really hooked me most strongly.

34:00.260 --> 34:02.860
 How are we supposed to think about those extra dimensions?

34:02.860 --> 34:05.940
 I was supposed to imagine actual physical reality

34:05.940 --> 34:08.620
 or is this more in the space of mathematics

34:08.620 --> 34:11.620
 that allows you to sort of come up with tricks

34:11.620 --> 34:14.620
 to describe the four dimensional reality

34:14.620 --> 34:17.420
 that we more directly perceive?

34:17.420 --> 34:19.700
 No one really knows the answer, of course,

34:19.700 --> 34:22.700
 but if I take the most straightforward approach

34:22.700 --> 34:23.540
 to string theory,

34:23.540 --> 34:28.020
 you really are imagining that these dimensions are there,

34:28.020 --> 34:28.860
 they're real.

34:28.860 --> 34:30.780
 I mean, just as you would say

34:30.780 --> 34:33.380
 that the three space dimensions around us,

34:33.380 --> 34:35.700
 left, right, back, forth, up, down,

34:35.700 --> 34:37.900
 yeah, they're real, they're here.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.340
 We are immersed within those dimensions.

34:40.340 --> 34:44.500
 These other dimensions are as real as these

34:44.500 --> 34:47.620
 with the one difference being their shape and their size

34:47.620 --> 34:50.500
 differs from the shape and size of the dimensions

34:50.500 --> 34:54.660
 that we have direct access to through human experience.

34:54.660 --> 34:57.700
 And one approach imagines that these extra dimensions

34:57.700 --> 35:01.060
 are tightly coiled up, curled up,

35:01.060 --> 35:03.380
 crushed together, if you will,

35:03.380 --> 35:06.500
 into a beautiful geometrical form

35:06.500 --> 35:08.820
 that's all around us,

35:08.820 --> 35:11.940
 but just too small for us to detect with our eyes,

35:11.940 --> 35:13.300
 too small for us to detect

35:13.300 --> 35:16.220
 even with the most powerful equipment that we have.

35:16.220 --> 35:18.940
 Nevertheless, according to the mathematics,

35:18.940 --> 35:21.580
 the size and the shape of those extra dimensions

35:21.580 --> 35:24.940
 leaves an imprint in the world that we do have access to.

35:24.940 --> 35:28.980
 So one of the ways that we have hoped yet to achieve

35:28.980 --> 35:31.820
 to make contact with experimental physics

35:31.820 --> 35:34.460
 is to see a signature of those extra dimensions

35:34.460 --> 35:36.580
 in places like the Large Hadron Collider

35:36.580 --> 35:38.220
 in Geneva, Switzerland.

35:38.220 --> 35:41.420
 And it hasn't happened yet, doesn't mean it won't happen,

35:41.420 --> 35:44.700
 but that would be a stunning moment

35:44.700 --> 35:46.140
 in the history of the species

35:46.140 --> 35:50.140
 if data that we acquired in these dimensions

35:50.140 --> 35:53.420
 gives us kind of incontrovertible evidence

35:53.420 --> 35:55.860
 that these dimensions are not the only dimensions.

35:55.860 --> 35:59.220
 I mean, how mind blowing would that be?

35:59.220 --> 36:00.980
 So with the Large Hadron Collider,

36:00.980 --> 36:03.260
 it would be something in the movement of the particles

36:03.260 --> 36:07.740
 or also the gravitational waves potentially be a place

36:07.740 --> 36:10.180
 where you can detect signs of multiple dimensions,

36:10.180 --> 36:12.340
 like with something like LIGO, but much more accurate.

36:12.340 --> 36:14.580
 In principle, all of these can work.

36:14.580 --> 36:18.340
 So one of the experiments that we had high hopes for,

36:18.340 --> 36:20.980
 but by high hopes, I'm actually exaggerating.

36:20.980 --> 36:24.340
 One of the experiments that we imagined

36:24.340 --> 36:26.580
 might in the best of all circumstances,

36:26.580 --> 36:27.540
 yield some insight.

36:27.540 --> 36:30.100
 We weren't with bated breath waiting for the result.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.620
 We knew it was a long shot.

36:31.620 --> 36:34.660
 When you slam protons together at very high speed

36:34.660 --> 36:35.980
 of the Large Hadron Collider,

36:35.980 --> 36:37.580
 if there are these extra dimensions

36:37.580 --> 36:39.660
 and if they have the right form,

36:39.660 --> 36:43.180
 and that's a hypothesis that may not be correct,

36:43.180 --> 36:44.940
 but when the protons collide,

36:44.940 --> 36:48.060
 they can create debris, energetic debris

36:48.060 --> 36:50.940
 that can in some sense leave our dimensions

36:50.940 --> 36:53.780
 and insert itself into the other dimensions.

36:53.780 --> 36:56.380
 And the way you'd recognize that is,

36:56.380 --> 36:58.620
 there'd be more energy before the collision

36:58.620 --> 37:00.940
 and after the collision because the debris

37:00.940 --> 37:03.780
 would have taken energy away from the place

37:03.780 --> 37:06.540
 where our detectors can detect it.

37:06.540 --> 37:09.060
 So that's one real concrete way

37:09.060 --> 37:12.020
 that you could find evidence for extra dimensions.

37:12.020 --> 37:16.020
 But yeah, since extra dimensions are of space

37:16.020 --> 37:19.380
 and gravity is something that exists within,

37:19.380 --> 37:22.780
 in fact is associated with the shape of space,

37:22.780 --> 37:25.220
 gravitational waves in principle

37:25.220 --> 37:30.220
 can provide a kind of cat scan of the extra dimensions

37:31.180 --> 37:35.340
 if you had sufficient control over those processes.

37:35.340 --> 37:38.660
 We don't yet, but perhaps one day we will.

37:38.660 --> 37:41.420
 Does it make you sad a little bit?

37:41.420 --> 37:43.020
 Maybe looking out into the future,

37:43.020 --> 37:46.140
 you mentioned Ed Witten that no Nobel prizes

37:46.140 --> 37:48.940
 have been given yet related to string theory.

37:48.940 --> 37:50.300
 Do you think they will be?

37:50.300 --> 37:53.620
 Do you think you have to have experimental validation

37:53.620 --> 37:55.500
 or can a Nobel prize be given?

37:55.500 --> 37:58.620
 Which I don't think has been given for quite a long time

37:58.620 --> 38:01.940
 for purely sort of theoretical contribution.

38:01.940 --> 38:06.140
 Yeah, it's certainly as a matter of historical precedent

38:06.140 --> 38:09.020
 has been the case that those who win the prize

38:09.020 --> 38:14.020
 have established, investigated, illuminated

38:14.180 --> 38:18.620
 a demonstrably real quality of the world.

38:18.620 --> 38:22.740
 So gravitational waves, the prize was awarded

38:22.740 --> 38:26.580
 after they were detected, not the mathematics of it,

38:26.580 --> 38:28.980
 but the actual detection of it.

38:28.980 --> 38:32.220
 The Higgs particle, it was an idea that came

38:32.220 --> 38:36.220
 from the 1960s, Peter Higgs and others in fact.

38:36.220 --> 38:41.220
 And it wasn't until 2012 on July 4th

38:41.420 --> 38:43.300
 when the announcement came that this particle

38:43.300 --> 38:45.660
 had been detected at the Large Hadron Collider

38:45.660 --> 38:49.140
 that people viewed it as eligible for the Nobel prize.

38:49.140 --> 38:50.700
 The idea was there, the math was there,

38:50.700 --> 38:52.780
 but you needed to confirm it.

38:52.780 --> 38:55.260
 Indeed, the prize ultimately was awarded.

38:55.260 --> 38:56.940
 So I'm not surprised.

38:56.940 --> 38:59.540
 In fact, I would have been surprised

38:59.540 --> 39:02.140
 if a Nobel prize had been awarded

39:02.140 --> 39:04.340
 in the arena of string theory

39:04.340 --> 39:07.180
 because it's far too speculative right now.

39:07.180 --> 39:09.060
 It's far too hypothetical.

39:09.060 --> 39:13.220
 In fact, I am sympathetic to the view

39:13.220 --> 39:15.900
 that it really shouldn't be called string theory.

39:15.900 --> 39:18.540
 It degrades the word theory

39:18.540 --> 39:20.900
 because theory in science, of course,

39:20.900 --> 39:23.740
 means the best available explanation

39:23.740 --> 39:25.940
 for the things that we observe in the world,

39:25.940 --> 39:30.820
 the things that we measure in experiments about the world.

39:30.820 --> 39:34.320
 And string theory does not do that, at least not yet.

39:34.320 --> 39:37.620
 So it really should be the string hypothesis, right?

39:37.620 --> 39:40.500
 We're at an earlier stage of development

39:40.500 --> 39:42.320
 and that's not the kind of thing

39:42.320 --> 39:45.580
 that Nobel prizes should be awarded for.

39:45.580 --> 39:48.700
 What do you think about the critics out there, Peter White,

39:48.700 --> 39:52.500
 he's from Columbia too, I think Sabine Hafenstatter.

39:53.380 --> 39:56.340
 Is that a healthy thing or should we sort of focus

39:56.340 --> 39:59.540
 on sort of the optimism of these hypotheses?

39:59.540 --> 40:03.060
 Yeah, it's actually a good way that you frame it

40:03.060 --> 40:08.060
 because I'm always somewhat repelled

40:09.060 --> 40:14.060
 by views of the world that start from the negative.

40:14.060 --> 40:18.820
 Try to cut down an idea, try to say that's the wrong way

40:18.820 --> 40:21.540
 of thinking about things and so on.

40:21.540 --> 40:24.980
 I'm much more drawn, maybe because I'm an optimist,

40:24.980 --> 40:27.460
 I don't know, I'm much more drawn to those

40:27.460 --> 40:30.660
 who go out into the world with new ideas.

40:30.660 --> 40:34.020
 And don't try to cut down one idea,

40:34.020 --> 40:38.020
 but rather present another one that might be better.

40:38.020 --> 40:41.940
 And so you make the first idea, maybe string theory irrelevant

40:41.940 --> 40:46.340
 because you've come up with the better approach

40:46.340 --> 40:47.580
 to the world.

40:47.580 --> 40:49.040
 So do I think it's healthy?

40:49.040 --> 40:53.020
 Look, I think having a wide range of views

40:53.020 --> 40:56.600
 and perspectives is generally a healthy thing.

40:56.600 --> 41:00.460
 I think it's good to have arguments within a subject

41:00.460 --> 41:04.060
 in order that you stay fresh and you stay focused

41:04.060 --> 41:06.420
 on the things that matter.

41:06.420 --> 41:07.740
 But in the end of the day,

41:07.740 --> 41:11.940
 I think it's a more vital contribution

41:11.940 --> 41:13.260
 to give us something new

41:13.260 --> 41:15.540
 rather than to criticize something that's there.

41:15.540 --> 41:17.020
 Yeah, I'm totally with you.

41:17.020 --> 41:19.780
 But it could be just the nature of being an optimist

41:19.780 --> 41:24.220
 and also just a love of engineering.

41:24.220 --> 41:29.220
 It helps nobody by criticizing the rocket

41:29.300 --> 41:30.580
 that somebody else built,

41:30.580 --> 41:34.560
 just build a bigger, cheaper, better rocket.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.580
 Right, exactly.

41:36.580 --> 41:38.980
 And that seems to be how human civilization

41:38.980 --> 41:40.420
 can progress effectively.

41:41.420 --> 41:44.900
 We've mentioned the second law of thermodynamics.

41:44.900 --> 41:46.860
 I gotta ask you about time.

41:46.860 --> 41:47.700
 Yeah.

41:47.700 --> 41:51.380
 And do you think of time as emergent

41:51.380 --> 41:53.700
 or fundamental to our universe?

41:53.700 --> 41:56.080
 I like to think of it as emergent.

41:56.080 --> 42:00.940
 I don't have a solid reason for that perspective.

42:00.940 --> 42:02.720
 I have a lot of hints of reasons

42:02.720 --> 42:04.340
 that some of which come out of string theory

42:04.340 --> 42:09.140
 and quantum gravity that perhaps would be worth talking about.

42:09.140 --> 42:11.980
 But what I would say is,

42:11.980 --> 42:16.980
 time is the most familiar quality of experience

42:17.020 --> 42:18.940
 because there's nothing that takes place

42:18.940 --> 42:22.140
 that doesn't take place within an interval of time.

42:22.140 --> 42:24.500
 And yet at the same time,

42:24.500 --> 42:28.420
 it is perhaps the most mysterious quality of the world.

42:28.420 --> 42:31.020
 So it's a wonderful confluence

42:31.020 --> 42:33.500
 of the familiar and the deeply mysterious

42:33.500 --> 42:35.980
 all in one little package.

42:35.980 --> 42:38.580
 If you were to ask me, what is time?

42:38.580 --> 42:39.760
 I don't really know.

42:39.760 --> 42:41.000
 I don't think anybody does.

42:41.000 --> 42:45.220
 I can say what time gives us,

42:45.220 --> 42:48.740
 it allows us the language for talking about change.

42:48.740 --> 42:52.580
 It allows us to envision the events of the universe

42:52.580 --> 42:55.860
 being spread out in this temporal timeline.

42:55.860 --> 42:59.080
 And in that way, allows us to see the patterns

42:59.080 --> 43:01.640
 that unfold within time.

43:01.640 --> 43:05.120
 I mean, time allows us the structure and the organization

43:05.120 --> 43:08.920
 to think about things in that kind of a progression.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.420
 But what actually is it?

43:11.420 --> 43:12.740
 I don't really know.

43:12.740 --> 43:16.380
 And that's so strange because we can measure it, right?

43:16.380 --> 43:19.060
 I mean, there are laboratories in the world

43:19.060 --> 43:21.100
 that measure this thing called time

43:21.100 --> 43:24.020
 to spectacular precision.

43:24.020 --> 43:28.460
 But if you go up to the folks and say,

43:28.460 --> 43:31.900
 what is it that you're actually measuring?

43:31.900 --> 43:34.540
 I don't know that they can really articulate

43:34.540 --> 43:37.180
 the kind of answer that you would expect

43:37.180 --> 43:39.360
 from those who are engineering a device

43:39.360 --> 43:41.460
 that can measure something called time

43:41.460 --> 43:43.100
 to that level of precision.

43:43.100 --> 43:45.880
 So it's a very curious combination.

43:46.860 --> 43:51.260
 What do you make of the one way feeling of causality?

43:51.260 --> 43:56.260
 Like is causality a thing or is that too just a human story

43:56.260 --> 44:00.780
 that we put on top of this emergent phenomenon of time?

44:00.780 --> 44:02.220
 I don't know.

44:02.220 --> 44:05.940
 I can give you my guess and my intuition about it.

44:05.940 --> 44:09.180
 I do think that at the macroscopic level,

44:09.180 --> 44:11.280
 if we're talking about sort of the human experience of time,

44:11.280 --> 44:13.320
 I do think at the macroscopic level,

44:13.320 --> 44:17.180
 there is a fundamental notion of causality

44:17.180 --> 44:20.060
 that does emerge from a starting point

44:20.060 --> 44:21.760
 that may not have causality built in.

44:21.760 --> 44:25.540
 So I certainly would allow that at the deepest description

44:25.540 --> 44:28.880
 of reality when we finally have that on the table,

44:28.880 --> 44:33.540
 we may not see causality directly at that fundamental level.

44:33.540 --> 44:36.240
 But I do believe that we will understand

44:36.240 --> 44:38.340
 how to go from that fundamental level

44:38.340 --> 44:41.440
 to a world where at the macroscopic level,

44:41.440 --> 44:44.460
 there is this notion of A causes B.

44:44.460 --> 44:47.660
 A notion that Einstein deeply embraced

44:47.660 --> 44:49.140
 in his special theory of relativity

44:49.140 --> 44:51.840
 where he showed that time has qualities

44:51.840 --> 44:54.280
 that we wouldn't expect based on experience.

44:54.280 --> 44:56.740
 You and I, if we move relative to each other,

44:56.740 --> 44:59.780
 our clocks tick off time at different rate.

44:59.780 --> 45:02.540
 And our clocks is just a means of measuring

45:02.540 --> 45:03.520
 this thing called time.

45:03.520 --> 45:05.860
 So this is really time that we're talking about.

45:05.860 --> 45:08.100
 Time for you and time for me are different

45:08.100 --> 45:09.280
 if we're in relative motion.

45:09.280 --> 45:11.500
 He then shows in the general theory of relativity

45:11.500 --> 45:15.040
 that if we're experiencing different gravity,

45:15.040 --> 45:16.300
 different gravitational fields

45:16.300 --> 45:17.280
 or actually more precisely

45:17.280 --> 45:19.180
 different gravitational potentials,

45:19.180 --> 45:21.660
 time will elapse for us at different rates.

45:21.660 --> 45:25.960
 These are things that are astoundingly strange

45:25.960 --> 45:29.700
 that give rise to a scientific notion of time travel.

45:29.700 --> 45:33.440
 Okay, so this is how far Einstein took us

45:33.440 --> 45:37.180
 in wiping away the old understanding of time

45:37.180 --> 45:40.420
 and injecting a new understanding of its qualities.

45:40.420 --> 45:44.420
 So there's so much about time that's counterintuitive,

45:44.420 --> 45:46.780
 but I do not think that we're ever going

45:46.780 --> 45:50.300
 to wipe away causality at the macroscopic level.

45:50.300 --> 45:52.340
 At the macroscopic, I mean, there's so many interesting

45:52.340 --> 45:53.900
 things at the macroscopic level

45:53.900 --> 45:56.680
 that may only exist at the macroscopic level.

45:56.680 --> 45:59.200
 Like we already talked about consciousness

45:59.200 --> 46:01.060
 that very well could be one of the things.

46:01.060 --> 46:02.260
 You mentioned time travel.

46:02.260 --> 46:07.260
 So, I mean, according to Einstein and in general,

46:09.180 --> 46:11.680
 what types of travel do you think

46:11.680 --> 46:14.020
 our physical universe allows?

46:14.020 --> 46:17.060
 Well, it certainly allows time travel to the future.

46:17.060 --> 46:18.660
 And I'm not talking about the silly thing

46:18.660 --> 46:21.420
 that you and I are now going into the future

46:21.420 --> 46:22.420
 second by second by second.

46:22.420 --> 46:24.700
 I'm talking about really the diversion

46:24.700 --> 46:27.460
 that you see in Hollywood, at least in terms

46:27.460 --> 46:32.260
 of its net effect, whereby an individual

46:32.260 --> 46:36.460
 can follow an Einsteinian strategy

46:36.460 --> 46:40.660
 and propel themselves into the future

46:40.660 --> 46:42.260
 in some sense more quickly.

46:42.260 --> 46:46.020
 So if I wanted to see what's happening on planet Earth

46:46.020 --> 46:50.100
 one million years from now, Einstein tells me

46:50.100 --> 46:52.500
 how to get one million years from now.

46:52.500 --> 46:53.340
 Build a ship.

46:53.340 --> 46:56.380
 I got to turn to guys who know how to build stuff.

46:56.380 --> 46:57.980
 I can't do it like you.

46:57.980 --> 47:00.020
 Build a ship that can go out into the universe

47:00.020 --> 47:02.780
 near the speed of light, turn around and come back.

47:02.780 --> 47:04.420
 Let's say it's a six month journey out

47:04.420 --> 47:05.900
 and a six month journey back.

47:05.900 --> 47:09.420
 And Einstein tells me how fast I need to travel,

47:09.420 --> 47:11.180
 how close to the speed of light I need to go

47:11.180 --> 47:13.740
 so that when I step out of my ship,

47:13.740 --> 47:16.980
 it will now be one million years into the future

47:16.980 --> 47:20.140
 on planet Earth.

47:20.140 --> 47:23.300
 And this is not a controversial statement, right?

47:23.300 --> 47:25.940
 This is not something where there's differences

47:25.940 --> 47:28.340
 of opinion in the scientific community.

47:28.340 --> 47:30.900
 Any scientist who knows anything

47:30.900 --> 47:35.100
 about what Einstein taught us agrees with what I just said.

47:35.100 --> 47:37.740
 It's commonplace, it's bread and butter physics.

47:37.740 --> 47:40.660
 And so that kind of travel to the future

47:40.660 --> 47:44.140
 is absolutely allowed by the laws of physics.

47:44.140 --> 47:45.820
 There are engineering challenges,

47:45.820 --> 47:47.940
 there are technological challenges.

47:47.940 --> 47:49.460
 They're close to the speed of light part, yeah.

47:49.460 --> 47:52.780
 Yeah, and there are even biological challenges, right?

47:52.780 --> 47:55.180
 They're G forces that you're gonna experience.

47:55.180 --> 47:57.740
 So there's all sorts of stuff embedded in this,

47:57.740 --> 48:01.020
 but those I will call the details.

48:01.020 --> 48:04.380
 And those details, notwithstanding,

48:04.380 --> 48:07.820
 the universe allows this kind of travel to the future.

48:07.820 --> 48:09.660
 And if I could pause real quick,

48:09.660 --> 48:12.620
 you could also, at the macro level,

48:12.620 --> 48:15.360
 with biology extend the human lifespan

48:15.360 --> 48:19.300
 to do a kind of travel forward in time.

48:19.300 --> 48:22.540
 If you expand how long we live,

48:22.540 --> 48:25.300
 that's a way to, from a perspective of an observer,

48:25.300 --> 48:27.780
 a conscious observer that is a human being,

48:27.780 --> 48:29.920
 you're essentially traveling forward in time

48:29.920 --> 48:32.740
 by allowing yourself to live long enough to see the thing.

48:32.740 --> 48:34.920
 So that's in the space of biology.

48:34.920 --> 48:37.160
 What about traveling back in time?

48:37.160 --> 48:41.980
 Yeah, that is a natural next question,

48:41.980 --> 48:45.540
 especially if you're going on one of these journeys.

48:45.540 --> 48:48.860
 Is it a one way journey or can you come back?

48:48.860 --> 48:52.480
 And the physics community doesn't speak

48:52.480 --> 48:55.220
 with a unified voice on this as yet,

48:55.220 --> 48:57.860
 but I would say that the dominant perspective

48:57.860 --> 49:00.260
 is that you cannot get back.

49:00.260 --> 49:03.900
 Now, having said that, there are proposals

49:03.900 --> 49:07.300
 that serious people have written papers on

49:07.300 --> 49:09.080
 regarding hypothetical ways

49:09.080 --> 49:10.900
 in which you could travel to the past.

49:10.900 --> 49:13.500
 And we've seen some of these.

49:13.500 --> 49:16.900
 Again, Hollywood loves to take the most sexy ideas

49:16.900 --> 49:20.040
 of physics and build narratives around them.

49:20.040 --> 49:21.980
 This idea of a wormhole,

49:21.980 --> 49:25.480
 like Jodie Foster in Contact went through a wormhole,

49:25.480 --> 49:26.500
 Deep Space Nine Star,

49:26.500 --> 49:27.860
 I'm sure there are many other examples

49:27.860 --> 49:30.480
 for these ideas that I've probably never even seen.

49:30.480 --> 49:34.460
 But with wormholes, there's at least a proposal

49:34.460 --> 49:38.200
 of how you could take a wormhole tunnel through space time,

49:38.200 --> 49:40.520
 manipulate the openings of the wormhole

49:40.520 --> 49:44.100
 in such a way that the openings are no longer synchronous.

49:44.100 --> 49:46.300
 They are out of sync relative to each other,

49:46.300 --> 49:48.980
 which would mean one's ahead and one's behind,

49:48.980 --> 49:50.500
 which means if you go through one direction,

49:50.500 --> 49:51.620
 you travel to the future.

49:51.620 --> 49:54.380
 If you go back, you travel to the past.

49:54.380 --> 49:57.740
 Now, we don't know if there are wormholes in the world.

49:57.740 --> 49:59.820
 But they're possible according to Einstein, correct?

49:59.820 --> 50:01.760
 They are possible according to Einstein.

50:01.760 --> 50:04.420
 But even Einstein was very quick to say,

50:04.420 --> 50:07.260
 just because my math allows for something,

50:07.260 --> 50:08.100
 doesn't mean it's real.

50:08.100 --> 50:10.860
 I mean, he famously didn't even believe in black holes.

50:10.860 --> 50:12.900
 Didn't believe in the Big Bang, right?

50:12.900 --> 50:17.180
 And yet the black hole issue has really been settled now.

50:17.180 --> 50:20.740
 We have radio telescopic photographs

50:20.740 --> 50:22.820
 of the black hole in M87.

50:22.820 --> 50:25.240
 It was in newspapers around the world

50:25.240 --> 50:26.360
 just a couple of years ago.

50:26.360 --> 50:31.180
 So it's just to say that just because it's in Einstein's math,

50:31.180 --> 50:32.180
 it doesn't mean it's real.

50:32.180 --> 50:35.000
 But yes, it is the case that wormholes

50:35.000 --> 50:36.680
 are allowed by Einstein's equations.

50:36.680 --> 50:39.460
 And in principle, you can imagine, you know,

50:39.460 --> 50:42.300
 putting electric charges on the openings of the wormhole,

50:42.300 --> 50:44.380
 allowing you to tow them around

50:44.380 --> 50:45.560
 in a manner that could yield

50:45.560 --> 50:48.180
 this temporal asymmetry between them.

50:48.180 --> 50:51.780
 Maybe you tow one of the mouths to the edge of a black hole.

50:51.780 --> 50:53.380
 In principle, you can do this,

50:53.380 --> 50:56.540
 slowing down the passage of time near that black hole.

50:56.540 --> 50:58.140
 And then when you bring it back,

50:58.140 --> 51:02.060
 it will be well out of sync with the other opening

51:02.060 --> 51:05.420
 and therefore could be a significant temporal gap

51:05.420 --> 51:07.100
 between one and the other.

51:07.100 --> 51:10.840
 But people who study this in more detail question,

51:10.840 --> 51:13.060
 could you ever keep a wormhole open,

51:13.060 --> 51:14.760
 assuming it does exist?

51:14.760 --> 51:17.420
 Could you ever travel through a wormhole

51:17.420 --> 51:19.700
 or would there be a requirement

51:19.700 --> 51:22.940
 to some kind of exotic matter to prop it open

51:22.940 --> 51:24.420
 that perhaps doesn't exist?

51:24.420 --> 51:28.060
 So there are many, many issues that people have raised.

51:28.060 --> 51:31.060
 And I would say that the general sentiment

51:31.060 --> 51:34.780
 is that it's unlikely that this kind of scenario

51:34.780 --> 51:37.980
 is going to survive our deeper understanding of physics

51:37.980 --> 51:39.220
 when we finally have it.

51:39.220 --> 51:41.340
 But that doesn't mean that the door is closed.

51:41.340 --> 51:44.800
 So maybe there's a small possibility

51:44.800 --> 51:45.640
 that this could one day be real.

51:45.640 --> 51:47.780
 That's such an interesting way to put it.

51:47.780 --> 51:49.820
 It will not, this kind of scenario

51:49.820 --> 51:53.500
 will not survive deep understanding of physics.

51:53.500 --> 51:54.860
 It's an interesting way to put it

51:54.860 --> 51:59.700
 because it makes you wonder what kind of scenarios

51:59.700 --> 52:04.080
 will be created by our deeper understanding of physics.

52:04.080 --> 52:08.340
 Maybe, sorry to go crazy for a second,

52:08.340 --> 52:11.220
 but if you have like the pan psychism idea

52:11.220 --> 52:14.200
 that consciousness permeates all matter,

52:14.200 --> 52:17.980
 maybe traveling in that, whatever laws of physics,

52:17.980 --> 52:20.140
 the consciousness operates under something like that.

52:20.140 --> 52:21.740
 In that view of the university,

52:21.740 --> 52:24.140
 if we somehow are able to understand that part,

52:24.140 --> 52:26.420
 maybe traveling is super easy.

52:26.420 --> 52:30.340
 Yeah, it does not follow the constraints

52:30.340 --> 52:32.700
 of the speed of light, something like this.

52:32.700 --> 52:37.700
 Yeah, so look, I have a definite degree of sympathy

52:38.380 --> 52:42.980
 with the possibility that consciousness might be more

52:42.980 --> 52:45.500
 than what we described earlier

52:45.500 --> 52:48.180
 as just the byproduct of mindless particles.

52:48.180 --> 52:50.500
 You just made the rock happy.

52:50.500 --> 52:54.340
 Exactly, so it isn't the approach

52:54.340 --> 52:59.340
 that feels to me the most likely, but I see the logic.

52:59.580 --> 53:01.680
 If you've got the puzzle,

53:01.680 --> 53:04.280
 how to mindless particles build mind,

53:04.280 --> 53:08.320
 one resolution might be the particles are not mindless.

53:08.320 --> 53:10.960
 The particles have some kind of proto conscious quality.

53:10.960 --> 53:13.020
 So there's something appealing

53:13.020 --> 53:16.180
 about that straightforward solution to the puzzle.

53:16.180 --> 53:20.140
 And if that's the case, if we do live in a pan psychist world

53:20.140 --> 53:22.980
 where there is a degree of consciousness residing

53:22.980 --> 53:25.220
 in everything in the world around us, then yes,

53:25.220 --> 53:28.820
 I do think some interesting possibilities might emerge

53:28.820 --> 53:31.720
 where maybe there's a way of communing

53:31.720 --> 53:36.720
 with physical reality in a deeper way than we have so far.

53:36.940 --> 53:38.660
 I mean, we as human beings,

53:38.660 --> 53:40.580
 a vital part of our existence

53:40.580 --> 53:43.860
 is human to human communication, contact.

53:43.860 --> 53:46.540
 We live in social groups and that's what it's allowed us

53:46.540 --> 53:48.820
 to get to the place where we've gotten.

53:48.820 --> 53:51.700
 Imagine that we have long missed

53:51.700 --> 53:54.700
 that there's other consciousness out there

53:54.700 --> 53:57.520
 and some kind of relationship or communion

53:57.520 --> 53:59.980
 with that larger conscious possibility

53:59.980 --> 54:01.380
 would take us to a different place.

54:01.380 --> 54:03.860
 Now, do I buy into this yet?

54:03.860 --> 54:06.420
 I don't, I don't see any evidence for it,

54:06.420 --> 54:10.460
 but do I have an open mind and allow for the possibility

54:10.460 --> 54:11.420
 in the future?

54:11.420 --> 54:12.320
 Yeah, I do.

54:13.460 --> 54:15.380
 So if that's not the case

54:15.380 --> 54:18.420
 and you have these simple particles

54:18.420 --> 54:21.880
 that at the macro level emerges some interesting stuff

54:21.880 --> 54:24.900
 like consciousness, another thing you write about

54:24.900 --> 54:27.280
 in the Until the End of Time book

54:27.280 --> 54:30.860
 is the thing that it seems to emerge at the macro level

54:30.860 --> 54:34.960
 is the feeling like there's a free will,

54:34.960 --> 54:36.380
 like we decide to do stuff.

54:36.380 --> 54:39.100
 And you have a really interesting take here,

54:39.100 --> 54:43.500
 which is, no, there's not a free will.

54:43.500 --> 54:45.900
 I'm just gonna speak for you and then you can correct me.

54:45.900 --> 54:48.080
 No, there's not a free will,

54:48.080 --> 54:51.420
 but there is an experience of freedom.

54:51.420 --> 54:52.260
 Yeah.

54:54.260 --> 54:56.100
 Which I really love.

54:56.100 --> 54:58.400
 So where does the experience,

54:58.400 --> 54:59.780
 where does freedom come from

54:59.780 --> 55:02.700
 if we don't have any kind of physics based free will?

55:02.700 --> 55:06.820
 Yeah, and so the idea follows naturally

55:06.820 --> 55:08.480
 from all that we've been talking about.

55:08.480 --> 55:11.860
 Let's make the assumption that all there is

55:11.860 --> 55:15.380
 in the physical universe is stuff governed by laws.

55:15.380 --> 55:16.520
 We may not have those laws,

55:16.520 --> 55:19.500
 may not know what the fundamental stuff is yet,

55:19.500 --> 55:23.700
 but everything we know in science points in the direction

55:23.700 --> 55:27.860
 that it's physical stuff governed by universal laws.

55:27.860 --> 55:31.380
 And that being the case, or that being the assumption,

55:31.380 --> 55:33.880
 then you come to a particular collection

55:33.880 --> 55:35.900
 of those ingredients called a human being.

55:35.900 --> 55:38.120
 And that human being has particles

55:38.120 --> 55:41.620
 that are fully governed by physical law.

55:41.620 --> 55:43.100
 And when you then recognize it,

55:43.100 --> 55:44.380
 every thought that we have,

55:44.380 --> 55:46.500
 every action that we undertake

55:46.500 --> 55:49.400
 is just the motion of particles.

55:49.400 --> 55:50.900
 When I'm thinking thoughts right now,

55:50.900 --> 55:53.840
 of course, at this level of description,

55:53.840 --> 55:56.320
 it is the motion of particles cascading

55:56.320 --> 55:59.820
 down various neurons inside of my head and so on.

55:59.820 --> 56:02.780
 And every single one of those motions,

56:02.780 --> 56:05.340
 collectively and individually,

56:05.340 --> 56:08.540
 is fully governed by these laws

56:08.540 --> 56:09.900
 that we perhaps don't have yet,

56:09.900 --> 56:12.060
 but we imagine one day we will.

56:12.060 --> 56:15.780
 That leaves no opportunity for any kind of freedom

56:15.780 --> 56:19.580
 to break free from the constraint of physical law.

56:19.580 --> 56:21.660
 And that is the end of the story.

56:21.660 --> 56:24.480
 So the traditional intuitive notion of free will,

56:24.480 --> 56:26.880
 that we're the ultimate authors of our actions,

56:26.880 --> 56:28.300
 that we were the buck stops,

56:28.300 --> 56:30.260
 that there is no antecedent,

56:30.260 --> 56:35.000
 that is the cause for our decided to go left or right,

56:35.000 --> 56:38.180
 choose vanilla or chocolate, live or die,

56:38.180 --> 56:42.060
 that intuitive sensation does not have a basis

56:42.060 --> 56:43.780
 in our understanding of the physical world.

56:43.780 --> 56:47.140
 So that's the end of the free will of the traditional sort.

56:47.140 --> 56:49.100
 But then your question is,

56:49.100 --> 56:52.020
 what about this other kind of freedom I talk about?

56:52.020 --> 56:53.900
 And the other kind of freedom,

56:53.900 --> 56:55.860
 if you focus on it intently,

56:55.860 --> 57:00.700
 I think is actually the true version of freedom

57:00.700 --> 57:02.180
 that we feel.

57:02.180 --> 57:04.300
 And that freedom is this.

57:04.300 --> 57:07.020
 You look at inanimate objects in the world,

57:07.020 --> 57:10.140
 rocks, bottles of water, whatever,

57:10.140 --> 57:13.340
 they have a very limited behavioral repertoire.

57:13.340 --> 57:14.180
 Why?

57:14.180 --> 57:17.100
 Their internal organization is too coarse

57:17.100 --> 57:18.880
 for them to do very much, right?

57:18.880 --> 57:22.040
 You try to have a conversation with a glass of water,

57:22.040 --> 57:24.800
 you send sound waves, it doesn't do much.

57:24.800 --> 57:26.140
 It may vibrate a little bit,

57:26.140 --> 57:30.200
 but the repertoire of responses are incredibly limited.

57:30.200 --> 57:33.060
 The difference between us and a rock or a bottle of water

57:33.060 --> 57:35.100
 is that our inner organization,

57:35.100 --> 57:38.420
 by virtue of eons of evolution by natural selection,

57:38.420 --> 57:42.720
 is so refined, so spectacularly ordered,

57:42.720 --> 57:46.460
 that we have a huge repertoire of behaviors

57:46.460 --> 57:51.460
 that are finely attuned to stimuli from the external world.

57:51.460 --> 57:53.320
 You ask me a question, that's a stimulus,

57:53.320 --> 57:54.460
 and all of a sudden,

57:54.460 --> 57:56.860
 these particle processes go into action,

57:56.860 --> 58:00.080
 and this is the result, this answer that I'm giving you.

58:00.080 --> 58:03.760
 So the freedom that we have is not from

58:03.760 --> 58:05.580
 the control of physical law.

58:05.580 --> 58:08.260
 The freedom that we have is from the constrained behavior

58:08.260 --> 58:11.380
 that has long since governed inanimate objects.

58:11.380 --> 58:14.700
 We are liberated from the limited behavioral repertoire

58:14.700 --> 58:17.220
 of rocks and bottles of water

58:17.220 --> 58:20.100
 to have this broad spectrum of responses.

58:20.100 --> 58:20.940
 Do we pick them?

58:20.940 --> 58:21.840
 We do not.

58:21.840 --> 58:23.060
 Do we freely choose them?

58:23.060 --> 58:26.060
 We do not, but yet we have them,

58:26.060 --> 58:29.340
 and we can marvel at those behaviors,

58:29.340 --> 58:31.460
 and that's the freedom that we have.

58:31.460 --> 58:34.300
 The complexity and the breadth of that repertoire

58:34.300 --> 58:36.700
 is where the freedom emerges.

58:36.700 --> 58:40.260
 Is there something to be said about emergence?

58:40.260 --> 58:42.060
 I don't know if you know,

58:42.060 --> 58:43.700
 I've looked at much about objects

58:43.700 --> 58:47.280
 that I seem to love way more than anyone else,

58:47.280 --> 58:48.500
 which is Sally or Tom,

58:49.420 --> 58:51.700
 like game of life type of stuff.

58:51.700 --> 58:56.700
 From simple things emerges beautiful complexities,

58:56.740 --> 58:58.980
 and so that's that repertoire.

58:58.980 --> 59:03.980
 It's like, it seems if you have enough stuff,

59:04.060 --> 59:06.300
 just beautiful complexity emerges

59:06.300 --> 59:09.620
 that sure as heck to our human eyes looks

59:09.620 --> 59:12.060
 like there's consciousness there, there's free will,

59:12.060 --> 59:15.640
 there's little objects moving about and making decisions.

59:15.640 --> 59:16.820
 I mean, all of that,

59:16.820 --> 59:18.920
 you can say it's anthropomorphization,

59:18.920 --> 59:21.820
 but it sure as heck feels

59:21.820 --> 59:24.580
 like they're organisms making decisions.

59:25.580 --> 59:27.660
 What is that emergence thing?

59:27.660 --> 59:31.220
 Is that within the realm of physics to understand?

59:31.220 --> 59:35.060
 Is it within the realm of poetry?

59:36.100 --> 59:39.620
 What is that, like complex systems, emergence?

59:39.620 --> 59:41.580
 Will that ever be understood by science?

59:41.580 --> 59:43.980
 So here's the way that I think about it.

59:43.980 --> 59:47.820
 So there are clearly qualities of the world

59:47.820 --> 59:50.980
 that emerge on macroscopic scales,

59:50.980 --> 59:53.740
 our sense of beauty, wonder, consciousness,

59:53.740 --> 59:55.900
 all of these kinds of qualities.

59:55.900 --> 1:00:00.180
 Do I feel that they ultimately are explainable

1:00:00.180 --> 1:00:01.180
 from the laws of physics?

1:00:01.180 --> 1:00:02.540
 I do.

1:00:02.540 --> 1:00:06.300
 There is nothing that's not ultimately explainable

1:00:06.300 --> 1:00:09.460
 with the laws of physics from this physicalist perspective,

1:00:09.460 --> 1:00:10.880
 which is what I take.

1:00:10.880 --> 1:00:13.980
 So you got the particles, you got the laws,

1:00:13.980 --> 1:00:16.180
 and you have things that emerge

1:00:16.180 --> 1:00:20.780
 from the choreographed motions of those particles.

1:00:20.780 --> 1:00:23.060
 But is that the best language

1:00:23.060 --> 1:00:26.100
 for talking about these emergent qualities?

1:00:26.100 --> 1:00:27.540
 Usually not.

1:00:27.540 --> 1:00:30.940
 If I was to take something even more mundane,

1:00:30.940 --> 1:00:33.180
 like a baseball flying through the air,

1:00:33.180 --> 1:00:35.680
 if I was to describe it in terms of the quarks

1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:36.820
 and the electrons,

1:00:36.820 --> 1:00:39.020
 I'd give you this mountain of data

1:00:39.020 --> 1:00:42.340
 with 10 to the 28 particles

1:00:42.340 --> 1:00:45.300
 and all of their coordinates and spaces

1:00:45.300 --> 1:00:46.120
 a function of time.

1:00:46.120 --> 1:00:46.960
 I hand you this mountain of data,

1:00:46.960 --> 1:00:49.180
 you'd be like, I don't know what this is.

1:00:49.180 --> 1:00:51.180
 And then if you really were clever and you're looking,

1:00:51.180 --> 1:00:53.240
 oh, it's a baseball,

1:00:53.240 --> 1:00:57.060
 just described in the least economical way possible.

1:00:57.060 --> 1:01:00.240
 It is much more useful and insightful

1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:01.940
 to talk about the baseball flying through the air.

1:01:01.940 --> 1:01:05.660
 Similarly, there are things at the macroscopic level

1:01:05.660 --> 1:01:09.680
 like human experience and human emotion and human action

1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:12.660
 and the sensation of free will

1:01:12.660 --> 1:01:14.780
 that we undeniably all have,

1:01:14.780 --> 1:01:17.420
 even if it itself doesn't have a basis

1:01:17.420 --> 1:01:19.460
 in our understanding of the physical world.

1:01:19.460 --> 1:01:24.380
 It's useful to talk about things in this very human language.

1:01:24.380 --> 1:01:26.700
 And so, yes, it's vital to talk about things

1:01:26.700 --> 1:01:29.360
 in the poetic language of human experience,

1:01:29.360 --> 1:01:31.820
 but do not lose sight of the fact, and some people do.

1:01:31.820 --> 1:01:33.880
 They say, oh, it's just an emergent phenomenon.

1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:36.100
 Don't lose sight of the fact that emergent phenomena

1:01:36.100 --> 1:01:39.840
 are emerging from this deeper understanding

1:01:39.840 --> 1:01:42.820
 that comes from the reductionist account of physical law.

1:01:42.820 --> 1:01:44.840
 And there's a lot of insight to come from that,

1:01:44.840 --> 1:01:48.580
 such as the freedom that you thought that you had,

1:01:48.580 --> 1:01:50.340
 the freedom of will that you thought you had.

1:01:50.340 --> 1:01:53.180
 It doesn't have a basis in that reductionist account,

1:01:53.180 --> 1:01:54.280
 so it's not real.

1:01:56.380 --> 1:01:59.060
 So speaking of the poetry of human experience,

1:01:59.060 --> 1:02:01.140
 you mentioned the images of the black holes.

1:02:01.140 --> 1:02:03.140
 How did it make you feel a few years ago

1:02:03.140 --> 1:02:04.820
 when that first image came out?

1:02:04.820 --> 1:02:06.300
 It's truly amazing.

1:02:06.300 --> 1:02:11.300
 A sense of, well, I guess the feeling was both amazing

1:02:11.860 --> 1:02:13.780
 and there was a little sense of,

1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:17.340
 jealousy is not quite the right word,

1:02:17.340 --> 1:02:19.540
 but a sense of longing.

1:02:19.540 --> 1:02:20.920
 Yeah, I think that's a better word,

1:02:20.920 --> 1:02:25.480
 because here's a subject that started with Einstein

1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:28.520
 back in 1915, writes down the equations

1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:30.620
 of the general theory of relativity,

1:02:30.620 --> 1:02:34.820
 and then there are scores of individuals over the decades,

1:02:34.820 --> 1:02:37.500
 starting with people like Karl Schwarzschild

1:02:37.500 --> 1:02:38.900
 who analyze the equations,

1:02:38.900 --> 1:02:40.340
 see the possibility of black holes.

1:02:40.340 --> 1:02:41.620
 People develop these ideas.

1:02:41.620 --> 1:02:44.140
 John Wheeler, all these greats of physics.

1:02:44.140 --> 1:02:46.460
 It's still a hypothetical subject.

1:02:46.460 --> 1:02:48.940
 It gets closer to reality through observations

1:02:48.940 --> 1:02:50.500
 of the center of our galaxy,

1:02:50.500 --> 1:02:52.400
 stars whipping around in a manner

1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:54.620
 that could only really be explained

1:02:54.620 --> 1:02:56.940
 by there being a black hole in the center of our galaxy,

1:02:56.940 --> 1:02:58.780
 but it was still indirect.

1:02:58.780 --> 1:03:03.580
 To actually have a direct image that you can look at,

1:03:03.580 --> 1:03:06.180
 what a beautiful arc, narrative arc

1:03:06.180 --> 1:03:10.180
 from the theoretical to the absolutely established.

1:03:10.180 --> 1:03:13.620
 And that's what we hope will happen with other areas,

1:03:13.620 --> 1:03:15.140
 for instance, string theory, right?

1:03:15.140 --> 1:03:18.620
 I mean, wholly mathematical subject at the outset

1:03:18.620 --> 1:03:22.580
 and still pretty much a wholly mathematical subject today.

1:03:22.580 --> 1:03:25.900
 Yeah, do we long for that image

1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:29.500
 where we can look at it and say, string, it's real.

1:03:29.500 --> 1:03:33.600
 I mean, how thrilling, how thrilling to be part

1:03:33.600 --> 1:03:36.420
 of that journey, to be part of that step

1:03:36.420 --> 1:03:39.040
 that moves things from the abstract to the concrete.

1:03:39.040 --> 1:03:44.040
 Yeah, so like the image of the DNA, the early images

1:03:44.240 --> 1:03:47.520
 of the DNA, for example, but there is something special.

1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:50.940
 So the problem with strings is they're tiny.

1:03:50.940 --> 1:03:54.900
 So it's harder to take a picture in the following sense.

1:03:54.900 --> 1:03:58.000
 When you think of a black hole, I mean, you have a swirl

1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.960
 of, I guess, what is, I don't even know it's dust,

1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:02.400
 whatever light.

1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:04.560
 A careening onto the event horizon.

1:04:04.560 --> 1:04:06.680
 And then there's darkness in the center.

1:04:06.680 --> 1:04:10.120
 And you just imagine, so that picture in particular,

1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:13.000
 I guess, is of a gigantic black hole.

1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:16.160
 So you just, I mean, it's terrifying.

1:04:16.160 --> 1:04:17.600
 Billions of times the mass of the sun.

1:04:17.600 --> 1:04:19.880
 Yeah, so it's both exciting and terrifying.

1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:22.040
 I mean, I don't know where you fall in the spectrum.

1:04:22.040 --> 1:04:24.920
 I think it's exciting at first.

1:04:24.920 --> 1:04:27.040
 Like the longer I think about it, every time I think

1:04:27.040 --> 1:04:29.280
 about it, the more terrifying it becomes.

1:04:29.280 --> 1:04:32.760
 So it always starts exciting and then it goes to terrifying.

1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:36.160
 And both are feelings, very human feelings

1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:38.360
 that I appreciate.

1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:40.600
 It's like terrified awe.

1:04:40.600 --> 1:04:43.080
 Somehow it's still beautiful.

1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:43.920
 It's a good way of saying it.

1:04:43.920 --> 1:04:45.960
 And I think I kind of share that reaction

1:04:45.960 --> 1:04:49.040
 because there is a way in which when you work on this

1:04:49.040 --> 1:04:52.880
 subject, like all the time, I teach it, I teach about

1:04:52.880 --> 1:04:55.540
 black holes, write the equations on the blackboard.

1:04:56.800 --> 1:05:01.800
 The ideas reside in a very cognitive,

1:05:01.800 --> 1:05:06.440
 I don't know, mathematical portion of the brain,

1:05:06.440 --> 1:05:08.280
 or at least for me.

1:05:08.280 --> 1:05:11.920
 And it's only when you like sit down and it's quiet

1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:13.680
 and you start to contemplate, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1:05:13.680 --> 1:05:16.240
 this isn't just like a mathematical game.

1:05:17.160 --> 1:05:19.400
 There are these monsters out there.

1:05:19.400 --> 1:05:22.760
 Now I don't, not in a sense of I fear for my life,

1:05:22.760 --> 1:05:27.760
 but it's a sense of how extraordinary is this universe.

1:05:28.360 --> 1:05:30.440
 And so it is breathtaking.

1:05:30.440 --> 1:05:31.960
 How powerful nature is.

1:05:31.960 --> 1:05:36.960
 Yeah, how stupendously powerful nature is.

1:05:37.280 --> 1:05:42.120
 And so there is a deep sense of humility

1:05:42.120 --> 1:05:45.200
 that I think this instills if you really allow

1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:46.680
 the ideas to sink in.

1:05:48.260 --> 1:05:51.440
 Well, I have to ask about the most stupendously

1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:54.360
 powerful thing to have ever happened in our universe,

1:05:54.360 --> 1:05:55.540
 which is the Big Bang.

1:05:56.520 --> 1:05:57.880
 What's up with the Big Bang?

1:05:57.880 --> 1:06:01.360
 So we can, I mean, with gravitational waves,

1:06:01.360 --> 1:06:05.040
 the hope is you have more and more accurate measurements

1:06:05.040 --> 1:06:06.040
 of the gravitational waves.

1:06:06.040 --> 1:06:08.440
 You can crawl back further and further back in time

1:06:08.440 --> 1:06:09.600
 towards the Big Bang.

1:06:10.680 --> 1:06:13.440
 Do you have a hope that we'll be able to understand

1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:18.080
 the early spark that created our universe?

1:06:18.080 --> 1:06:23.080
 Yeah, that and the deep interior of a black hole

1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:26.960
 I think are the biggest mysteries that we hope

1:06:26.960 --> 1:06:30.720
 the melding of quantum mechanics and gravity will reveal,

1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:32.440
 will illuminate.

1:06:32.440 --> 1:06:36.960
 And what question could be more captivating

1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:39.920
 than why is there something rather than nothing, right?

1:06:39.920 --> 1:06:43.240
 Why is there a universe at all?

1:06:43.240 --> 1:06:46.360
 And will the theories that we're developing

1:06:46.360 --> 1:06:48.480
 take us to an answer to that?

1:06:48.480 --> 1:06:49.720
 I don't know.

1:06:49.720 --> 1:06:51.680
 Even if we truly knew what the Big Bang is,

1:06:51.680 --> 1:06:53.480
 and that's a big question in its own right,

1:06:53.480 --> 1:06:55.120
 one would still be left with the question,

1:06:55.120 --> 1:06:59.080
 well, okay, so you've explained the process

1:06:59.080 --> 1:07:03.560
 by which a tiny nugget of a universe,

1:07:03.560 --> 1:07:08.160
 a tiny nugget of space time can undergo some kind of growth

1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:10.080
 to yield the world around us.

1:07:10.080 --> 1:07:12.920
 But presumably in that explanation,

1:07:12.920 --> 1:07:16.400
 you're gonna involve mathematics and some ingredients

1:07:16.400 --> 1:07:21.400
 like quantum fields or matter or energy or something.

1:07:21.880 --> 1:07:24.680
 Where did that stuff come from?

1:07:24.680 --> 1:07:26.880
 Can we get to that level of explanation?

1:07:26.880 --> 1:07:29.120
 I don't know, but it is remarkable

1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:34.120
 that if you ask what happened a millionth of a second

1:07:34.280 --> 1:07:36.040
 after the Big Bang,

1:07:36.040 --> 1:07:40.240
 it's not really that controversial any longer, right?

1:07:40.240 --> 1:07:42.760
 Even though there's a lot of argument in the field

1:07:42.760 --> 1:07:45.400
 and it's very heated right now I should say

1:07:45.400 --> 1:07:49.920
 regarding what is the right theory of the Big Bang?

1:07:49.920 --> 1:07:53.440
 What is the right theory of early universe cosmology

1:07:53.440 --> 1:07:55.000
 where I mean early, much earlier

1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:56.040
 than a millionth of a second,

1:07:56.040 --> 1:08:01.040
 a lot of dissent, a lot of heated arguments about that.

1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:02.680
 No pun intended.

1:08:02.680 --> 1:08:04.280
 Yeah, right, exactly.

1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:08.160
 But you go like a millionth of a second after that

1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:10.080
 and we're on pretty firm ground.

1:08:10.080 --> 1:08:12.160
 Isn't that amazing, right?

1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:15.400
 To understand what happened from that point forward.

1:08:15.400 --> 1:08:18.240
 But to go back is controversial.

1:08:18.240 --> 1:08:21.600
 So there is this theory called inflationary cosmology,

1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:24.560
 which I would say has been the dominant paradigm

1:08:24.560 --> 1:08:27.120
 since early 1980s.

1:08:27.120 --> 1:08:27.960
 So what does that mean?

1:08:27.960 --> 1:08:28.920
 Roughly 40 years now,

1:08:28.920 --> 1:08:31.400
 it's been the dominant cosmological paradigm.

1:08:31.400 --> 1:08:33.760
 And it makes use of a curious feature

1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:36.000
 of Einstein's general theory of relativity,

1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:37.240
 his theory of gravity,

1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:39.800
 where Einstein shows us mathematically

1:08:39.800 --> 1:08:41.840
 that gravity can not only be attractive,

1:08:41.840 --> 1:08:43.280
 the kind of gravity that we're used to,

1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:47.400
 things pulled together, but it can also be repulsive.

1:08:47.400 --> 1:08:52.400
 And that fact is then leveraged by people like Alan Guth

1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:56.240
 and Andre Linde, and at the time Paul Steinhardt

1:08:56.240 --> 1:08:58.760
 and Andreas Albrecht and others to say,

1:08:58.760 --> 1:09:01.400
 okay, if we had a little nugget in the earlier universe,

1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:03.520
 which was filled with the stuff

1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:05.520
 that yields this repulsive gravity,

1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:07.360
 well, that would have blown everything apart.

1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:09.160
 It would cause everything to swell.

1:09:09.160 --> 1:09:11.400
 Beautiful explanation for what the bang

1:09:11.400 --> 1:09:13.040
 in the big bang was.

1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:16.760
 And then people mathematically analyze the consequences

1:09:16.760 --> 1:09:19.040
 of this idea and they make predictions

1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:22.680
 for tiny temperature differences across the night sky

1:09:22.680 --> 1:09:24.840
 that in principle could be measured.

1:09:24.840 --> 1:09:27.120
 You send up balloons, you send up satellites

1:09:27.120 --> 1:09:29.920
 with very refined thermometers,

1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:33.000
 and they measured the temperature of the night sky

1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:34.800
 and the statistical distribution

1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:36.440
 of the temperature differences agrees

1:09:36.440 --> 1:09:38.280
 with the mathematical predictions.

1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:43.200
 I mean, you just sort of have to stand in awe

1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:44.560
 of this insight.

1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:48.320
 So you think, aha, the theory has been established,

1:09:48.320 --> 1:09:53.320
 but scientists are an incredibly skeptical bunch.

1:09:54.200 --> 1:09:56.640
 And some scientists, including one of the people

1:09:56.640 --> 1:09:58.360
 who helped develop the theory at the outset,

1:09:58.360 --> 1:10:00.960
 Paul Steinhardt comes along and says,

1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:04.120
 well, yeah, this theory has done pretty well so far,

1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:06.480
 but there are aspects of this theory

1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:08.160
 that are making me lose confidence.

1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:10.880
 For instance, this theory seems to suggest

1:10:10.880 --> 1:10:13.360
 that there might be other universes.

1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:15.280
 Like, how do you make sense of a theory

1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:16.880
 that suggests there are other universes?

1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:18.920
 Or there are others who come along and say,

1:10:18.920 --> 1:10:23.240
 this theory seems to talk about length scales

1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:26.680
 that are minuscule even by the so called Planck length,

1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:29.360
 the sort of shortest length that we can imagine

1:10:29.360 --> 1:10:31.840
 making sense of in a theory of quantum gravity.

1:10:31.840 --> 1:10:33.440
 How do you make sense of that?

1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:36.720
 And so on and so forth, they develop a list of things

1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:38.560
 that they consider to be chinks

1:10:38.560 --> 1:10:42.600
 in the inflationary cosmological theory's armor.

1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:44.120
 And they develop other ideas,

1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:47.560
 which they claim yield the same predictions

1:10:47.560 --> 1:10:48.640
 as inflationary cosmology

1:10:48.640 --> 1:10:50.440
 for those temperature differences across space,

1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:52.840
 but don't suffer from these problems.

1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:55.160
 And then the inflationary cosmology folks say,

1:10:55.160 --> 1:10:56.720
 no, no, no, hang on.

1:10:56.720 --> 1:10:59.920
 Your theory suffers from different problems.

1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:02.600
 And so the arguments goes, it's a healthy debate.

1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:05.120
 Talk about real debates in science.

1:11:05.120 --> 1:11:07.800
 So when you ask what's up with the Big Bang,

1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:09.920
 I don't know right now.

1:11:09.920 --> 1:11:12.760
 If you would have asked me five years ago,

1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:15.160
 maybe even less than that, three or four years ago,

1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:19.080
 I've said, look, inflationary cosmology has some issues,

1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:23.560
 but the package of explanations it provides is so potent

1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:28.560
 and the issues that beset it are seemingly solvable to me

1:11:29.080 --> 1:11:32.920
 that I would imagine it's going to in the end, win out.

1:11:32.920 --> 1:11:34.200
 I would still say that today,

1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:36.200
 but I wouldn't say it as loudly.

1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:38.800
 I wouldn't say it as confidently.

1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:42.120
 I think it's worth thinking about alternate ideas

1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:44.280
 and it could be the case that the paradigm

1:11:44.280 --> 1:11:45.680
 at some point shifts.

1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:50.480
 Does dark matter and dark energy fit into the shifting

1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:52.520
 of the explanations for those?

1:11:52.520 --> 1:11:53.360
 Yeah, certainly.

1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:58.360
 So dark energy has in the inflationary theory

1:11:58.440 --> 1:12:00.200
 is kind of a big mystery.

1:12:00.200 --> 1:12:05.200
 So dark energy is the observational realization

1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:06.800
 in the last 20 years

1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:09.440
 that not only is the universe expanding,

1:12:09.440 --> 1:12:11.520
 it's expanding ever more quickly.

1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:15.080
 Something is still pushing things outward.

1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:18.320
 And the explanation is that there's like a residual version

1:12:18.320 --> 1:12:20.560
 of the repulsive gravity from the early universe,

1:12:20.560 --> 1:12:23.000
 but it's such a strange number.

1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.600
 When you write that amount of dark energy

1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:29.080
 using the relevant units in a theory of quantum gravity,

1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:33.040
 it's a decimal point followed by like 120 zeros

1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:34.640
 and then a one.

1:12:34.640 --> 1:12:38.280
 We're not used to those kinds of numbers in physics.

1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:43.280
 We're used to a half, one, pi, e squared to two.

1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:46.720
 Those are the kinds of fundamental numbers

1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:49.840
 that emerge in our explanations of the world.

1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:51.920
 And we look at this bizarre number,

1:12:51.920 --> 1:12:53.720
 decimal point, all these zeros and a one,

1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:56.200
 we say something's wrong there.

1:12:56.200 --> 1:12:59.600
 Like where would that number have come from?

1:12:59.600 --> 1:13:01.800
 And now there are people who suggest resolution to it.

1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:03.600
 So it's not like we're totally in the dark on it,

1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:06.680
 but those people like Paul Steinhard

1:13:06.680 --> 1:13:09.120
 who have alternate cosmological theories,

1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:11.160
 cyclic cosmologies as they call it,

1:13:11.160 --> 1:13:14.480
 claim that they have a more natural explanation

1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:15.880
 of the dark energy,

1:13:15.880 --> 1:13:19.360
 that it naturally feeds into a cyclical process

1:13:19.360 --> 1:13:22.760
 that is their cosmological paradigm.

1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:26.240
 So yeah, if the cosmology should change,

1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:29.200
 it's conceivable our view of dark energy

1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:31.480
 may change from deeply mysterious

1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:34.240
 to deeply integrated into a different paradigm.

1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:35.560
 That is possible.

1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:37.440
 I think it's Roger Penrose that think

1:13:37.440 --> 1:13:39.480
 that information can bleed through

1:13:39.480 --> 1:13:42.440
 from before the Big Bang to the after the Big Bang.

1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:46.880
 Is the Big Bang like a full erasure of the hard drive

1:13:46.880 --> 1:13:48.920
 or is there some information that could bleed through?

1:13:48.920 --> 1:13:53.920
 Yeah, I mean, so Roger is among the most creative thinkers

1:13:54.040 --> 1:13:55.760
 of the last 100 years,

1:13:55.760 --> 1:13:59.280
 rightly won the Nobel Prize for his insights

1:13:59.280 --> 1:14:02.000
 into singularities in space time

1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:06.480
 that we know to afflict our mathematical solutions

1:14:06.480 --> 1:14:08.120
 of black holes in the Big Bang and so forth.

1:14:08.120 --> 1:14:13.120
 And he has an enormously fertile imagination.

1:14:13.400 --> 1:14:16.320
 And I mean that in the most positive sense.

1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:19.640
 And so he has put forward this idea,

1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:21.880
 this conformal cyclic cosmology,

1:14:21.880 --> 1:14:23.760
 I think is the official title,

1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:26.280
 although I could be getting that wrong.

1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:27.920
 I can't say that I've studied it.

1:14:27.920 --> 1:14:30.280
 I have seen lectures on it.

1:14:30.280 --> 1:14:33.240
 I don't find it convincing as yet.

1:14:33.240 --> 1:14:38.240
 It feels like it's being built to find a solution

1:14:38.720 --> 1:14:42.200
 as opposed to sort of more naturally emerging.

1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:43.920
 Maybe Roger would say otherwise.

1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:45.720
 And I don't mean to in any way

1:14:47.040 --> 1:14:48.440
 cast aspersions on the work.

1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:51.400
 It's vital and interesting and people are thinking about it.

1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:55.400
 I don't consider it as close a competitor

1:14:55.400 --> 1:14:58.080
 to say the inflationary theory as for instance,

1:14:58.080 --> 1:15:00.840
 the stuff that Paul Steinhardt has put forward.

1:15:00.840 --> 1:15:04.120
 But again, you've got to keep an open mind

1:15:04.120 --> 1:15:06.320
 in this business when there's so much

1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:07.680
 that we don't yet understand.

1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:08.800
 I mean, it is wild to think

1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:10.880
 that information could survive something like that.

1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:13.320
 Just like it is wild to imagine

1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:16.560
 that information could escape a black hole, for example.

1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:20.160
 It just seems like by construction,

1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:24.160
 these things are supposed to not bleed out anything.

1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:25.840
 But one of the challenges in all of these theories

1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:27.640
 is when we talk about a singularity,

1:15:27.640 --> 1:15:30.200
 has this real sexy term, the singularity.

1:15:30.200 --> 1:15:33.560
 But a singularity is in more ordinary language,

1:15:35.560 --> 1:15:39.760
 a physical system where the mathematics breaks down.

1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:41.080
 It's nonsensical.

1:15:41.080 --> 1:15:42.800
 It's like taking one divided by zero.

1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:45.640
 You put that into a calculator and it says E error, right?

1:15:45.640 --> 1:15:48.240
 It does not make sense, doesn't compute.

1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:53.240
 And so it's very hard to make definitive statements

1:15:53.240 --> 1:15:56.160
 about things like the Big Bang or about black holes

1:15:56.160 --> 1:15:59.840
 until we cure the mathematical singularities.

1:15:59.840 --> 1:16:03.160
 And there are some who claim that in certain regimes,

1:16:03.160 --> 1:16:05.800
 the singularities have been cured.

1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:08.560
 I don't by any means think that there's consensus

1:16:08.560 --> 1:16:09.560
 on these ideas.

1:16:09.560 --> 1:16:12.560
 So when one talks about information sort of bleeding

1:16:12.560 --> 1:16:15.000
 through the Big Bang, you've really got to make sure

1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:16.840
 that the equations have no singularity.

1:16:16.840 --> 1:16:18.240
 You talk about cyclic cosmology,

1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:20.040
 you've got to make sure that the equations

1:16:20.040 --> 1:16:22.080
 don't have any singularities as you go from, say,

1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:23.680
 one cycle to the next.

1:16:23.680 --> 1:16:25.640
 Now, some of the proponents of these theories claim

1:16:25.640 --> 1:16:27.520
 that they have resolved these issues.

1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:30.160
 I don't think that there's a general sense

1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:32.920
 that that is the case as yet, but it could be that,

1:16:32.920 --> 1:16:36.360
 look, life is so short that I haven't had the time

1:16:36.360 --> 1:16:39.000
 to deeply delve into all the mathematical intricacies

1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:40.760
 of all the ideas that have been put forward.

1:16:40.760 --> 1:16:42.720
 If I did that, I'd never do anything else.

1:16:42.720 --> 1:16:44.200
 But that's what the issue is.

1:16:44.200 --> 1:16:45.880
 And of course, it's just math.

1:16:45.880 --> 1:16:47.240
 There may be holes.

1:16:47.240 --> 1:16:52.240
 There may be gaps in our understanding

1:16:52.920 --> 1:16:55.160
 in the way we're modeling physical reality.

1:16:55.160 --> 1:16:56.000
 Well, that's the point.

1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:57.480
 In fact, when you said, I was about to jump in

1:16:57.480 --> 1:16:59.360
 and say modeling, but you got there first,

1:16:59.360 --> 1:17:01.080
 and it's exactly the right point.

1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:04.640
 We're talking about the universe here, right?

1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:06.960
 And how do you talk about the universe

1:17:06.960 --> 1:17:09.000
 with a straight face, mathematically?

1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:12.080
 And the way you do it is you simplify,

1:17:12.080 --> 1:17:14.680
 you throw away those characteristics of the universe

1:17:14.680 --> 1:17:18.520
 that you don't think are vital to a full understanding.

1:17:18.520 --> 1:17:21.560
 And so we're gonna get to a point people are starting to

1:17:21.560 --> 1:17:24.800
 where we've got to go beyond those simplifications.

1:17:24.800 --> 1:17:29.360
 And so cosmology has for a long time modeled the universe

1:17:29.360 --> 1:17:33.320
 in the most simplest terms, homogeneous, isotropic.

1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:35.920
 It has just a few parameters that describe it,

1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:38.560
 the average density of mass and energy and so forth.

1:17:38.560 --> 1:17:40.360
 We have to go beyond those simplifications,

1:17:40.360 --> 1:17:43.400
 and that will require putting these things on computers.

1:17:43.400 --> 1:17:45.200
 We're not gonna be able to do calculations there.

1:17:45.200 --> 1:17:49.640
 So much as astrophysics has gone beyond many simplifications

1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:53.280
 to now give really detailed simulations of star systems

1:17:53.280 --> 1:17:54.880
 and galaxies and so forth,

1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:56.880
 we're gonna have to do that with cosmology,

1:17:56.880 --> 1:17:59.120
 and people are starting to do that today.

1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:02.880
 Yeah, I've seen some interesting work on simulation,

1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:05.760
 most simulation cosmology, by the way, is just awesome.

1:18:05.760 --> 1:18:08.720
 But just like simulation of the early formation

1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:12.960
 of our solar system to understand how the like the Oort cloud

1:18:12.960 --> 1:18:16.520
 and just, I don't know, the whole of it,

1:18:16.520 --> 1:18:21.520
 how Earth came to be, like how Jupiter just protects us.

1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:27.600
 And then there's like weird like moons and volcanoes

1:18:28.160 --> 1:18:30.600
 and like modeling all of that,

1:18:30.600 --> 1:18:34.440
 the formation of all of that is fascinating.

1:18:34.440 --> 1:18:37.120
 Because that naturally is the question

1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:41.200
 of how does life emerge on these kinds of rocks?

1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:43.000
 How does a rock become a rabbit?

1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:47.440
 But speaking of models,

1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:50.360
 there's an equation called the Drake equation.

1:18:50.360 --> 1:18:52.720
 We were talking about life.

1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:56.360
 Have to ask, at the highest level first,

1:18:56.360 --> 1:18:58.040
 when you look out there,

1:18:58.040 --> 1:19:01.240
 how many alien civilizations do you think are out there?

1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:04.640
 Well, zero, one, or many?

1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:08.200
 So if you say civilization,

1:19:08.200 --> 1:19:11.440
 I would bring my number way down.

1:19:12.480 --> 1:19:13.880
 It could be zero.

1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:19.640
 If you talk about life, I think it could be many.

1:19:20.520 --> 1:19:21.800
 As we were saying before,

1:19:21.800 --> 1:19:25.840
 I think the move from life to consciousness,

1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:27.480
 the kinds of beings that would build

1:19:27.480 --> 1:19:30.720
 what we would recognize as a civilization,

1:19:30.720 --> 1:19:34.240
 that may be extraordinarily rare.

1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:36.080
 I hope it's not.

1:19:36.080 --> 1:19:38.080
 You know, as a kid, I loved Star Trek.

1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:40.560
 I just loved the idea that we would be part

1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:43.680
 of some universal community where,

1:19:43.680 --> 1:19:46.000
 look, experience on planet Earth

1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.120
 suggests it doesn't always go so well

1:19:48.120 --> 1:19:50.880
 when groups who are separated try to come together

1:19:50.880 --> 1:19:53.760
 and live in some larger collective.

1:19:53.760 --> 1:19:55.920
 But again, as an optimist,

1:19:55.920 --> 1:19:57.920
 how amazing would it be to converse

1:19:57.920 --> 1:19:59.800
 with an alien civilization and learn

1:19:59.800 --> 1:20:03.600
 what they've figured out about physics and cosmology

1:20:03.600 --> 1:20:06.960
 and compare notes and learn from each other

1:20:06.960 --> 1:20:09.280
 in some wonderful way?

1:20:09.280 --> 1:20:10.480
 I love that idea.

1:20:10.480 --> 1:20:13.800
 But if you ask me the likelihood of it,

1:20:13.800 --> 1:20:18.560
 I would err on saying it may be so improbable

1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:21.680
 that the conditions conspire to allow life

1:20:21.680 --> 1:20:24.680
 to move to this place of consciousness

1:20:24.680 --> 1:20:27.120
 that it might be rare.

1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:28.640
 It might be oversimplifying things,

1:20:28.640 --> 1:20:32.560
 but just observing the power of the evolutionary process,

1:20:32.560 --> 1:20:34.360
 I tend to believe,

1:20:34.360 --> 1:20:39.000
 and like you read different theories of how we went,

1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:42.320
 how Homo sapiens evolved,

1:20:43.200 --> 1:20:45.560
 it seems like the evolutionary process

1:20:45.560 --> 1:20:50.040
 naturally leads to Homo sapiens

1:20:50.040 --> 1:20:53.200
 or creatures like that or much better than that.

1:20:53.200 --> 1:20:57.320
 So to me, there's several scary scenarios.

1:20:57.320 --> 1:21:00.760
 So, okay, the positive scenario

1:21:00.760 --> 1:21:03.240
 is life itself is really difficult.

1:21:03.240 --> 1:21:05.840
 So that origin of life is difficult.

1:21:05.840 --> 1:21:08.040
 That's exciting for many reasons

1:21:08.040 --> 1:21:12.520
 because we might be able to prove that wrong easily

1:21:12.520 --> 1:21:14.760
 in the near term by finding life elsewhere.

1:21:14.760 --> 1:21:15.920
 Sure.

1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:20.920
 The scary thing to me is if life is easy

1:21:21.320 --> 1:21:26.120
 and there's plenty of conscious intelligent civilizations

1:21:26.120 --> 1:21:30.600
 out there and we have not obviously made contact,

1:21:30.600 --> 1:21:33.320
 which means with intelligence and consciousness

1:21:33.320 --> 1:21:38.320
 comes responsibility and ultimately destruction.

1:21:39.920 --> 1:21:42.840
 So with power comes great responsibility

1:21:42.840 --> 1:21:44.760
 and then we end up destroying ourselves.

1:21:44.760 --> 1:21:48.120
 That's the scariest.

1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:50.200
 The positive, I guess, version is that

1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:53.040
 maybe we're being watched,

1:21:54.280 --> 1:21:57.200
 sort of like there's a transition

1:21:57.200 --> 1:22:00.720
 to where you don't wanna ruin the primitive villages

1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:04.600
 out there and so there's a protective layer around us.

1:22:04.600 --> 1:22:05.760
 They're watching.

1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:09.520
 So where do you in these possible explanations

1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:10.520
 to the Fermi paradox,

1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:12.240
 why haven't we contacted aliens?

1:22:12.240 --> 1:22:13.600
 Do you land on?

1:22:13.600 --> 1:22:17.720
 Well, I think the most straightforward explanation

1:22:17.720 --> 1:22:19.360
 is that there aren't any.

1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:23.160
 Now, there are many other explanations too.

1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:25.560
 So you can't be dogmatic about things

1:22:25.560 --> 1:22:27.640
 that are just sort of gut feel,

1:22:27.640 --> 1:22:31.800
 but one of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes,

1:22:31.800 --> 1:22:33.280
 I don't know if you ever saw this one

1:22:33.280 --> 1:22:36.280
 where this alien civilization finally comes

1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:39.280
 to planet Earth and gives us this book

1:22:39.280 --> 1:22:42.680
 that they really want us to have and to hold

1:22:42.680 --> 1:22:44.760
 and it's in this foreign language,

1:22:44.760 --> 1:22:45.600
 you don't understand it.

1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:49.120
 The cryptographers, they desperately try to decipher it

1:22:49.120 --> 1:22:52.480
 as humans are gonna visit this other alien planet

1:22:52.480 --> 1:22:53.720
 and they're all sending back postcards,

1:22:53.720 --> 1:22:55.240
 how wonderful it is and so forth

1:22:55.240 --> 1:22:58.560
 and they finally decipher the title.

1:22:58.560 --> 1:23:01.480
 It's To Serve Man and everyone's so thrilled,

1:23:01.480 --> 1:23:03.680
 oh, they're here to serve us, it all makes sense

1:23:03.680 --> 1:23:06.240
 and then just as one of the final cryptographers

1:23:06.240 --> 1:23:08.160
 is going on to the alien ship,

1:23:08.160 --> 1:23:10.880
 his helper runs and says,

1:23:10.880 --> 1:23:12.960
 I've deciphered the rest of the book.

1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:14.920
 To Serve Man, it's a cookbook.

1:23:14.920 --> 1:23:19.920
 So yeah, is that a possibility?

1:23:20.920 --> 1:23:21.760
 Sure.

1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:23.960
 And so could they be watching us

1:23:23.960 --> 1:23:26.040
 and just sort of waiting for us to get

1:23:26.040 --> 1:23:29.680
 to a mature enough level?

1:23:29.680 --> 1:23:31.120
 I don't know, it strikes me.

1:23:31.120 --> 1:23:33.440
 Well, I think it'd be better to have this conversation

1:23:33.440 --> 1:23:35.040
 after the James Webb Telescope.

1:23:35.040 --> 1:23:38.440
 I mean, I do think that if we look

1:23:38.440 --> 1:23:41.360
 at the atmospheres of many planets,

1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:42.520
 I mean, there's now an estimate now

1:23:42.520 --> 1:23:47.520
 that there's on order of one planet per star on average.

1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.760
 So we've long known that the galaxy,

1:23:50.760 --> 1:23:52.800
 hundreds of billions of stars,

1:23:52.800 --> 1:23:54.800
 numbers of galaxies, hundreds of billions of galaxies.

1:23:54.800 --> 1:23:56.680
 So we're talking about hundreds of billions

1:23:56.680 --> 1:23:59.040
 of hundreds of billions of planets, oh my.

1:23:59.040 --> 1:24:02.320
 And if we start to survey some of these planets

1:24:02.320 --> 1:24:03.840
 and one after the other after the other,

1:24:03.840 --> 1:24:06.360
 we just sort of find no evidence

1:24:06.360 --> 1:24:10.400
 for any of the biological markers.

1:24:10.400 --> 1:24:11.320
 It could be, of course,

1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:13.840
 maybe life takes a radically different form.

1:24:13.840 --> 1:24:15.400
 It'd be hard to know that.

1:24:15.400 --> 1:24:18.280
 But I think that would at least give us some insight

1:24:18.280 --> 1:24:19.360
 on the life question.

1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:21.960
 But I just don't see how we get insight

1:24:21.960 --> 1:24:25.120
 on the civilization or consciousness question

1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:27.560
 without the direct connection.

1:24:27.560 --> 1:24:31.640
 And it strikes me that if consciousness is ubiquitous,

1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:35.080
 let's say life is, I'm willing to grant that.

1:24:35.080 --> 1:24:37.280
 If consciousness is also ubiquitous,

1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:41.680
 then I don't understand why they haven't been here

1:24:41.680 --> 1:24:43.520
 or why there hasn't been separation

1:24:43.520 --> 1:24:47.920
 because presumably they should be much further ahead of us.

1:24:47.920 --> 1:24:50.200
 How unlike would it be that we're like,

1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:52.120
 of all consciousness in the universe,

1:24:52.120 --> 1:24:53.520
 we're the most advanced.

1:24:53.520 --> 1:24:56.960
 That'd be such a special place for human beings

1:24:56.960 --> 1:25:00.160
 that it's hard for me to grant that as a likely possibility.

1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:02.680
 Rather, I think we're kind of run of the mill.

1:25:02.680 --> 1:25:06.000
 And there are many who are far more advanced than us.

1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:09.080
 And I don't think that they would expend the energy

1:25:09.080 --> 1:25:11.360
 to hide themselves.

1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:12.800
 I don't think they care enough.

1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:15.880
 And so see, that's actually what I believe

1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:19.160
 that there's a very large number of civilizations

1:25:19.160 --> 1:25:21.440
 that are far more advanced than us.

1:25:21.440 --> 1:25:25.200
 But my sense is that humans are exceptionally limited

1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:29.280
 both in our direct sensory capabilities and our physics,

1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:33.240
 our tools of sensing that just like with the string theory

1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:36.520
 and the multiple dimensions, we're just not like,

1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:39.040
 it's like, I honestly believe there could be stuff

1:25:39.040 --> 1:25:42.760
 in front of our nose that we're just not seeing

1:25:43.720 --> 1:25:48.720
 because we're too dumb, too much hubris

1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:50.920
 and I mean, there's a bunch of stuff

1:25:50.920 --> 1:25:54.920
 and too ignorant to the fabric of reality,

1:25:54.920 --> 1:25:56.280
 all of those things.

1:25:56.280 --> 1:25:59.840
 We're young in terms of intelligence.

1:25:59.840 --> 1:26:01.880
 But I guess what I'd say is like, I'm on board

1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:04.120
 with all of that as a real possibility,

1:26:04.120 --> 1:26:09.120
 but then it does strike me that we are sufficiently

1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:11.760
 able to observe the unit.

1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:16.760
 Look, we can look back to a fraction of the duration

1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:20.040
 from here to the, just a fraction is left

1:26:20.040 --> 1:26:22.680
 that we are unable to see.

1:26:22.680 --> 1:26:27.320
 So however young we are, we have been able

1:26:27.320 --> 1:26:29.960
 to sort of pierce the universe and it just strikes me

1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:33.280
 that there would be some signature,

1:26:33.280 --> 1:26:35.240
 but maybe that's coming.

1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:38.080
 But look, having said that I do, look,

1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:41.560
 I certainly note the fact that it's rare

1:26:41.560 --> 1:26:46.120
 that I stoop down while walking in Manhattan

1:26:46.120 --> 1:26:48.920
 and sort of dig up some ants in the bushes

1:26:48.920 --> 1:26:51.520
 on the side of the street and talk to the ants, right?

1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:52.960
 Because it's just not interesting to me.

1:26:52.960 --> 1:26:56.080
 So if we're like the ants on the cosmological landscape,

1:26:56.080 --> 1:26:58.760
 then yeah, I can imagine that the super advanced aliens

1:26:58.760 --> 1:27:01.960
 would be like, like whoever, you know,

1:27:01.960 --> 1:27:04.320
 but I feel like we're sufficiently advanced

1:27:04.320 --> 1:27:07.200
 that there should be some signal signature of that,

1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:08.320
 but maybe it's coming.

1:27:08.320 --> 1:27:10.680
 I think the deeper fundamental problem between us

1:27:10.680 --> 1:27:12.760
 and the ants is that we don't have a common language.

1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:14.600
 It's not the interest.

1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:17.280
 It's that we don't even have a common language.

1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:21.840
 And so the alien civilizations don't even know how to,

1:27:21.840 --> 1:27:24.720
 like we humans have convinced ourselves we're special

1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:25.880
 because we developed the language.

1:27:25.880 --> 1:27:28.760
 And you talked about the importance of language

1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:31.640
 to the intelligence, but it makes you wonder

1:27:31.640 --> 1:27:36.360
 like how very niche is that like club that we've,

1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:38.440
 like tribe we've created of language

1:27:38.440 --> 1:27:41.480
 and linguistic type of systems that are very specific

1:27:41.480 --> 1:27:42.880
 to our particular kinds of brains

1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:45.240
 and we share ideas together are all super excited

1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:46.520
 that we can understand the universe

1:27:46.520 --> 1:27:49.320
 because we came up with some notation and math.

1:27:49.320 --> 1:27:52.440
 I wonder if there's some totally other kinds of language

1:27:52.440 --> 1:27:54.440
 that communicates on a different timescale

1:27:54.440 --> 1:27:56.840
 with different, very different mechanisms

1:27:56.840 --> 1:28:00.080
 in the space of information that just is not,

1:28:00.080 --> 1:28:03.200
 it's everything, everything is lost in translation.

1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:05.120
 Yeah, and it could well be as a look.

1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:07.800
 I mean, I think part of the reason I go

1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:12.800
 toward the possibility of the soul intelligence

1:28:12.840 --> 1:28:16.400
 is there's a certain kind of romantic appeal

1:28:16.400 --> 1:28:20.800
 to looking out in the cosmos and it's just quiet

1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:22.520
 and it's just eternal silence.

1:28:22.520 --> 1:28:25.320
 There's something that appeals to me

1:28:25.320 --> 1:28:27.840
 at an emotional level that way.

1:28:27.840 --> 1:28:31.680
 But yeah, I mean, nobody knows.

1:28:31.680 --> 1:28:35.480
 And it's certainly conceivable

1:28:35.480 --> 1:28:38.640
 that there's just a radical mismatch

1:28:38.640 --> 1:28:40.040
 between the kinds of things

1:28:40.040 --> 1:28:42.840
 that we are able to observe and sensitive to

1:28:42.840 --> 1:28:47.160
 versus the kinds of structures that permeate the universe

1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:50.400
 in a manner that simply we're unable to detect.

1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:54.000
 Well, if we are alone, that is exciting.

1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:56.560
 And one of the ways it's exciting

1:28:56.560 --> 1:29:00.280
 is that it's up to us to become,

1:29:00.280 --> 1:29:02.760
 to expand out into the universe,

1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:07.760
 to permeate consciousness out into the universe.

1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:09.960
 So that's where space exploration comes in.

1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:12.440
 Let me ask you as somebody who's a screen theorist,

1:29:12.440 --> 1:29:17.120
 a physicist, do you think space exploration,

1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:21.440
 a colonizing space is a physics or an engineering problem?

1:29:21.440 --> 1:29:22.280
 What would you say?

1:29:22.280 --> 1:29:25.440
 Yeah, I think it's fundamentally an engineering problem

1:29:25.440 --> 1:29:30.440
 if we're not trying to do things like build wormholes

1:29:30.440 --> 1:29:32.960
 the way they did, say an interstellar

1:29:32.960 --> 1:29:34.160
 to get to a different place

1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:36.880
 or trying to travel near the speed of light

1:29:36.880 --> 1:29:38.360
 so that we would actually be able

1:29:38.360 --> 1:29:40.120
 to traverse interstellar distances.

1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:41.800
 I mean, without that,

1:29:41.800 --> 1:29:46.800
 our colonization will happen in a very, very slow rate.

1:29:47.920 --> 1:29:50.400
 But one of the beauties of relativity

1:29:50.400 --> 1:29:51.920
 is if you do travel near the speed of light,

1:29:51.920 --> 1:29:56.000
 you can actually go arbitrarily far in a human lifetime.

1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:57.120
 People say, how's that possible?

1:29:57.120 --> 1:29:59.120
 You can't go billions of light years.

1:29:59.120 --> 1:30:01.720
 Billions of light years, well, you can actually,

1:30:01.720 --> 1:30:03.440
 because as you can do the speed of light,

1:30:03.440 --> 1:30:06.080
 the way in which space and time change

1:30:06.080 --> 1:30:08.640
 allows you to go in principle arbitrarily far.

1:30:08.640 --> 1:30:09.960
 That's very exciting.

1:30:09.960 --> 1:30:13.640
 But if we put that physics side of the issue

1:30:13.640 --> 1:30:15.960
 and the manipulation of space and time to the side,

1:30:15.960 --> 1:30:18.360
 yeah, I think it's a deep engineering problem.

1:30:18.360 --> 1:30:21.680
 How do you terraform other planets?

1:30:21.680 --> 1:30:26.680
 I mean, how do you go beyond our local neighborhood,

1:30:26.680 --> 1:30:30.320
 say without using the ideas of relativity?

1:30:30.320 --> 1:30:32.080
 So I think it's all quite exciting.

1:30:32.080 --> 1:30:34.920
 And I think the idea is using solar sails

1:30:34.920 --> 1:30:36.680
 that people have developed

1:30:36.680 --> 1:30:40.720
 and trying to take that first step to Mars,

1:30:40.720 --> 1:30:43.960
 I think that's a vital and valuable step to take.

1:30:43.960 --> 1:30:44.800
 But yeah, I think these are

1:30:44.800 --> 1:30:46.320
 fundamentally engineering challenges.

1:30:46.320 --> 1:30:49.440
 Or extending the human lifespan through biology research

1:30:49.440 --> 1:30:54.440
 or maybe reducing what it means to be a human being

1:30:54.440 --> 1:30:57.720
 into information and uploading certain parts of it.

1:30:57.720 --> 1:31:00.920
 Maybe not all of the full resolution of a human life,

1:31:00.920 --> 1:31:03.920
 but maybe the essential things like the DNA

1:31:03.920 --> 1:31:06.120
 and be able to reconstruct that human being.

1:31:07.920 --> 1:31:11.160
 But I have to ask about Mars.

1:31:12.600 --> 1:31:17.520
 Do you find the dream of humans stepping on Mars,

1:31:17.520 --> 1:31:20.820
 stepping foot first, but also colonizing Mars,

1:31:20.820 --> 1:31:25.020
 one that's worth us fighting for?

1:31:25.020 --> 1:31:25.980
 Yeah, usually so.

1:31:25.980 --> 1:31:28.500
 I mean, I think what we have long been

1:31:28.500 --> 1:31:32.940
 not always in the best way is a species of explorers

1:31:33.900 --> 1:31:37.020
 in the literal sense of traveling

1:31:37.020 --> 1:31:39.540
 from one part of the world to another,

1:31:39.540 --> 1:31:41.340
 or in the more metaphorical sense

1:31:41.340 --> 1:31:45.100
 of trying to travel through our minds to the quantum realm

1:31:45.100 --> 1:31:47.740
 or back to the Big Bang or to the center of black holes.

1:31:47.740 --> 1:31:51.460
 So I think that's fundamentally part of the human spirit.

1:31:51.460 --> 1:31:56.460
 So I do think that's a vital part of our heritage

1:31:56.860 --> 1:32:01.020
 brought forward into its next incarnation.

1:32:01.020 --> 1:32:01.980
 That's who we are.

1:32:03.740 --> 1:32:06.860
 Do you think there'll be a day in the future

1:32:06.860 --> 1:32:11.300
 where a human being is born on Mars

1:32:11.300 --> 1:32:16.300
 and has to learn about his or her human origins on Earth?

1:32:16.300 --> 1:32:17.900
 Like, they'll have to read in a book.

1:32:18.860 --> 1:32:20.420
 Yeah, I don't think it'll be a book at that stage.

1:32:20.420 --> 1:32:22.900
 It'll probably just be uploaded into the head or something

1:32:22.900 --> 1:32:25.220
 or imprinted into the DNA,

1:32:25.220 --> 1:32:26.900
 and then they just sort of sense it.

1:32:26.900 --> 1:32:29.540
 But yeah, I think there's, well, look,

1:32:29.540 --> 1:32:32.340
 the issue you raised before is the vital one.

1:32:32.340 --> 1:32:36.020
 Is it the case that any sufficiently advanced civilization

1:32:36.020 --> 1:32:37.420
 destroys itself?

1:32:37.420 --> 1:32:39.820
 Is that sort of a commonplace quality?

1:32:39.820 --> 1:32:41.460
 I mean, that's the other potential answer

1:32:41.460 --> 1:32:43.220
 to the Fermi paradox.

1:32:43.220 --> 1:32:44.060
 Why aren't they here?

1:32:44.060 --> 1:32:47.020
 Because by the time they got to the technological development

1:32:47.020 --> 1:32:49.140
 where they could travel here, they blew themselves up.

1:32:49.140 --> 1:32:50.300
 They destroyed themselves.

1:32:50.300 --> 1:32:53.060
 And that's an unfortunate,

1:32:53.060 --> 1:32:57.100
 but not a hard to imagine possibility

1:32:57.100 --> 1:33:01.020
 based on things that have happened here on planet Earth.

1:33:01.020 --> 1:33:02.980
 But putting that to the side,

1:33:02.980 --> 1:33:05.460
 I think that's the big obstacle,

1:33:05.460 --> 1:33:06.460
 but putting that to the side,

1:33:06.460 --> 1:33:09.140
 we will resolve the engineering challenges.

1:33:09.140 --> 1:33:12.940
 And I should probably modify my answer

1:33:12.940 --> 1:33:15.940
 from before when you said, is it engineering or physics?

1:33:15.940 --> 1:33:17.460
 It's really both, right?

1:33:17.460 --> 1:33:20.460
 So we will surmount the engineering challenges

1:33:20.460 --> 1:33:23.620
 and that will then make the physics challenges relevant.

1:33:23.620 --> 1:33:24.980
 It'll make it relevant to figure out

1:33:24.980 --> 1:33:26.900
 how to travel near the speed of light.

1:33:26.900 --> 1:33:27.980
 It'll make it relevant to learn

1:33:27.980 --> 1:33:32.180
 how to manipulate the shape of space time and so forth.

1:33:32.180 --> 1:33:35.660
 So I think it's a multi stage process

1:33:35.660 --> 1:33:38.100
 where it is engineering and ultimately physics.

1:33:38.100 --> 1:33:40.380
 And if we stick around long enough,

1:33:40.380 --> 1:33:41.380
 those are the kinds of challenges

1:33:41.380 --> 1:33:43.460
 I think that we're ultimately gonna surmount.

1:33:43.460 --> 1:33:45.340
 And then the physics side is figuring out

1:33:45.340 --> 1:33:46.700
 how to harness energy enough

1:33:46.700 --> 1:33:48.700
 to travel outside the solar system,

1:33:48.700 --> 1:33:51.140
 which seems like a heck of a difficult journey.

1:33:51.140 --> 1:33:52.780
 But even Mars itself,

1:33:54.780 --> 1:33:57.420
 I don't know, maybe because I was born in the Soviet Union

1:33:57.420 --> 1:34:00.900
 and was born with the,

1:34:02.140 --> 1:34:04.660
 looking up at the stars and that dream

1:34:04.660 --> 1:34:06.740
 of like the highest of human achievement

1:34:06.740 --> 1:34:08.900
 is the ability to fly out there,

1:34:08.900 --> 1:34:10.380
 to join the stars.

1:34:10.380 --> 1:34:13.220
 I really liked the idea of going to Mars

1:34:13.220 --> 1:34:15.580
 and not just stepping foot on Mars.

1:34:15.580 --> 1:34:20.580
 And it wasn't until maybe misinformed,

1:34:21.060 --> 1:34:22.540
 but for me personally,

1:34:23.860 --> 1:34:26.420
 it wasn't until Elon Musk started talking

1:34:26.420 --> 1:34:28.700
 about the colonization of Mars,

1:34:28.700 --> 1:34:33.700
 did I realize like we humans can actually do that.

1:34:34.300 --> 1:34:38.100
 And first of all, the importance of somebody saying

1:34:38.100 --> 1:34:42.780
 that we can do these seemingly impossible things

1:34:42.780 --> 1:34:47.780
 is immeasurable because the fact that he placed that

1:34:48.660 --> 1:34:52.140
 into my mind and into the minds of millions of others,

1:34:52.140 --> 1:34:54.860
 maybe hundreds of millions, maybe billions of others,

1:34:54.860 --> 1:34:58.660
 young kids today, I mean, that's gonna make it a reality.

1:34:58.660 --> 1:35:00.900
 I, for some reason, am deeply excited,

1:35:01.860 --> 1:35:06.260
 even though my work isn't AI that echoes all of this.

1:35:06.260 --> 1:35:09.500
 I'm excited by the idea that somebody would be born,

1:35:09.500 --> 1:35:14.180
 as we were saying, on Mars and sort of look up

1:35:14.180 --> 1:35:16.660
 and be able to see with a telescope Earth

1:35:16.660 --> 1:35:19.340
 and say, that's where I came from.

1:35:19.340 --> 1:35:23.540
 I don't know, that idea scale to other planets,

1:35:23.540 --> 1:35:26.620
 to other solar systems, that's really exciting.

1:35:26.620 --> 1:35:28.020
 And hugely exciting.

1:35:28.020 --> 1:35:29.300
 I think you're absolutely right.

1:35:29.300 --> 1:35:33.820
 I mean, the vital thing is to dream, right?

1:35:33.820 --> 1:35:36.380
 I mean, and it sounds hackneyed,

1:35:36.380 --> 1:35:40.340
 but it is so important for young kids,

1:35:40.340 --> 1:35:42.220
 for the next generation,

1:35:42.220 --> 1:35:45.460
 to think about the things that are seemingly impossible.

1:35:45.460 --> 1:35:47.140
 I mean, that's what makes them possible.

1:35:47.140 --> 1:35:50.300
 And this is one which is concrete enough.

1:35:50.300 --> 1:35:52.100
 I mean, this is something that's gonna happen soon

1:35:52.100 --> 1:35:54.820
 in terms of actually going to Mars.

1:35:54.820 --> 1:35:59.820
 And then the next step of establishing some presence,

1:36:00.340 --> 1:36:02.620
 some semi permanent or permanent presence.

1:36:02.620 --> 1:36:05.460
 This is not something that's gonna wait

1:36:05.460 --> 1:36:06.580
 to the 25th century.

1:36:06.580 --> 1:36:07.740
 I mean, this is something that's gonna happen

1:36:07.740 --> 1:36:09.140
 relatively soon.

1:36:09.140 --> 1:36:11.220
 So, I mean, it could well be in your lifetime,

1:36:11.220 --> 1:36:13.660
 unlikely mine, but possibly in your lifetime

1:36:13.660 --> 1:36:15.460
 that that kid will be born

1:36:15.460 --> 1:36:18.260
 and have the experience that you described.

1:36:18.260 --> 1:36:20.740
 So yeah, it's spectacularly exciting.

1:36:21.620 --> 1:36:24.260
 And I actually, I would love to go on Mars

1:36:24.260 --> 1:36:25.900
 on one of the early.

1:36:25.900 --> 1:36:26.740
 You would? Yeah.

1:36:26.740 --> 1:36:28.180
 It would if it's one way.

1:36:28.180 --> 1:36:29.900
 I'm happy to do it one way. Really?

1:36:29.900 --> 1:36:30.740
 Wow. Yeah.

1:36:30.740 --> 1:36:32.540
 I'm single if there's ladies out there

1:36:32.540 --> 1:36:34.540
 that wanna start that family.

1:36:34.540 --> 1:36:36.540
 Let's go out to Mars.

1:36:36.540 --> 1:36:37.740
 No, I think.

1:36:37.740 --> 1:36:38.580
 See, I have to tell you something.

1:36:38.580 --> 1:36:42.700
 You spoke about terror, thinking about like black holes.

1:36:42.700 --> 1:36:45.420
 If I actually think about going to Mars

1:36:45.420 --> 1:36:49.740
 and being on Mars and put myself in there fully,

1:36:49.740 --> 1:36:51.780
 that's terror inducing.

1:36:51.780 --> 1:36:54.940
 The idea of to be in this foreign world

1:36:54.940 --> 1:36:56.740
 where you can't come back,

1:36:56.740 --> 1:37:00.060
 where you've made this choice that can't be reversed.

1:37:00.060 --> 1:37:01.700
 Well, at some point it may be,

1:37:01.700 --> 1:37:06.700
 but in that guise, that to me carries a deep sense of terror.

1:37:08.780 --> 1:37:11.100
 I feel that sense of terror every time Kerouac,

1:37:11.100 --> 1:37:13.860
 Jack Kerouac talked about this on the road

1:37:13.860 --> 1:37:17.420
 is when you leave a place, if you're honest about it,

1:37:18.540 --> 1:37:19.860
 like life is short.

1:37:20.740 --> 1:37:23.140
 And when you leave a place, you move to a new place

1:37:23.140 --> 1:37:25.220
 and you think of all the friends, maybe family

1:37:25.220 --> 1:37:28.060
 you're leaving behind as you drive over the hill,

1:37:28.060 --> 1:37:31.460
 that really is goodbye.

1:37:31.460 --> 1:37:33.260
 Like we sometimes don't think of it that way

1:37:33.260 --> 1:37:36.220
 when we're moving, but that really is goodbye to that life,

1:37:36.220 --> 1:37:38.620
 to the person you were, to all the people.

1:37:38.620 --> 1:37:41.780
 Maybe if it's close friends, you'll see them maybe 10, 15

1:37:41.780 --> 1:37:43.820
 more times in your life and that's it.

1:37:43.820 --> 1:37:46.100
 And you're saying goodbye to all of that.

1:37:46.100 --> 1:37:50.180
 And so in the same way, I see it as way more dramatic

1:37:50.180 --> 1:37:52.620
 when you're flying away from earth and it's like,

1:37:52.620 --> 1:37:56.180
 it's goodbye to Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks.

1:37:56.180 --> 1:37:59.420
 And it's goodbye to whatever, I don't know why I picked

1:37:59.420 --> 1:38:03.820
 those, but some, all the things that are special to earth,

1:38:03.820 --> 1:38:06.900
 it's goodbye, but that's life.

1:38:06.900 --> 1:38:11.700
 I suppose more, what excites me about that kind of journey

1:38:11.700 --> 1:38:14.780
 is it's a distinct contemplation of your mortality,

1:38:14.780 --> 1:38:16.660
 acceptance of your mortality.

1:38:16.660 --> 1:38:20.420
 You're saying, just like when you take on any difficult

1:38:20.420 --> 1:38:25.180
 journey, it's accepting that you're going to die one day

1:38:25.180 --> 1:38:28.740
 and might as well do something truly exciting.

1:38:28.740 --> 1:38:31.580
 Yes, I mean, I will, you know, I'm with you on that.

1:38:31.580 --> 1:38:36.580
 I'm a strong believer that deep underneath human motivation

1:38:36.780 --> 1:38:41.020
 is this terror of our own mortality.

1:38:41.020 --> 1:38:43.180
 Yeah, there's this a wonderful book that had a great

1:38:43.180 --> 1:38:47.580
 influence in me called The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker.

1:38:47.580 --> 1:38:52.580
 And when you are aware of the ways in which our mortality

1:38:52.580 --> 1:38:57.020
 influences our behaviors, it really does add a different

1:38:57.020 --> 1:38:59.940
 slant, a different kind of color to the interpretation

1:38:59.940 --> 1:39:01.620
 of human behavior.

1:39:01.620 --> 1:39:05.620
 Yeah, it's funny that that book had a big influence

1:39:05.620 --> 1:39:06.460
 in me as well.

1:39:06.460 --> 1:39:07.300
 Oh, is that right?

1:39:07.300 --> 1:39:08.140
 Wow.

1:39:08.140 --> 1:39:12.140
 And the terror management theory and I, again,

1:39:12.140 --> 1:39:14.620
 from an engineering perspective, I don't know how many

1:39:14.620 --> 1:39:19.100
 people that book influenced because I talk to people

1:39:19.100 --> 1:39:21.220
 about the fear of death and it doesn't seem like

1:39:21.220 --> 1:39:24.140
 about the fear of death and it doesn't seem to be

1:39:24.140 --> 1:39:26.580
 that fundamental to their experience.

1:39:26.580 --> 1:39:28.860
 And I don't think on the surface it's fundamental

1:39:28.860 --> 1:39:30.740
 to my experience, but it seems like an awfully,

1:39:30.740 --> 1:39:33.380
 in terms of we talk about models and strength theory

1:39:33.380 --> 1:39:37.380
 and theories, in terms of theories of this macro experience

1:39:37.380 --> 1:39:40.940
 of human life, it seems like a heck of a good theory

1:39:40.940 --> 1:39:43.980
 that the fear of death is at the kind of is the warm

1:39:43.980 --> 1:39:44.820
 at the core.

1:39:44.820 --> 1:39:47.420
 Yeah, well, I mean, and the terror management theories

1:39:47.420 --> 1:39:51.060
 that you make reference to, I mean, this is a group

1:39:51.060 --> 1:39:54.380
 of psychologists, social psychologists who devise

1:39:54.380 --> 1:39:58.340
 these very clever experiments, real world experiments

1:39:58.340 --> 1:40:02.140
 with real people, where you can directly measure

1:40:02.140 --> 1:40:05.580
 the hidden influence of the recognition

1:40:05.580 --> 1:40:07.460
 of our own mortality.

1:40:07.460 --> 1:40:09.220
 I mean, they've done these experiments where they have

1:40:09.220 --> 1:40:11.540
 group of people A, group of people B,

1:40:11.540 --> 1:40:12.900
 and the only difference between the two groups

1:40:12.900 --> 1:40:16.180
 is that group B, they somehow reminded them

1:40:16.180 --> 1:40:18.060
 in some subtle way of their own mortality.

1:40:18.060 --> 1:40:21.180
 Sometimes it's nothing more than interviewing them

1:40:21.180 --> 1:40:23.940
 with a funeral home across the street.

1:40:23.940 --> 1:40:25.820
 And influence is there, but it's subtle,

1:40:25.820 --> 1:40:27.500
 you don't even think you'd take note of.

1:40:27.500 --> 1:40:32.260
 And they can find measurable effects that differentiate

1:40:32.260 --> 1:40:36.300
 the two groups to a high degree of statistical significance

1:40:36.300 --> 1:40:38.900
 and how they respond to certain challenges

1:40:38.900 --> 1:40:42.820
 or certain kinds of questions that shows a direct influence

1:40:42.820 --> 1:40:45.980
 of the reminder of their own mortality.

1:40:45.980 --> 1:40:48.620
 And I've read a number of these studies

1:40:48.620 --> 1:40:51.660
 and they are really convincing.

1:40:51.660 --> 1:40:54.060
 And so yeah, I would say that the reason why

1:40:54.060 --> 1:40:58.060
 so many people would say that, yeah, fear of mortality,

1:40:58.060 --> 1:41:01.140
 it's not front and center in my worldview.

1:41:01.140 --> 1:41:02.380
 Yeah, I don't really think about it much,

1:41:02.380 --> 1:41:03.300
 it doesn't really matter too much.

1:41:03.300 --> 1:41:05.100
 The reason why they're able to say that

1:41:05.100 --> 1:41:08.540
 is because this thing called culture has emerged

1:41:08.540 --> 1:41:10.780
 over the course of the last 10,000 years.

1:41:10.780 --> 1:41:14.260
 And part of the role of culture is to give us a means

1:41:14.260 --> 1:41:17.060
 of not thinking about our mortality all the time,

1:41:17.060 --> 1:41:20.020
 of not living in terror of the inevitable end,

1:41:20.020 --> 1:41:21.780
 which faces us all.

1:41:21.780 --> 1:41:24.500
 So it's completely understandable that that's the response

1:41:24.500 --> 1:41:27.860
 because that's what culture is at least in part for.

1:41:27.860 --> 1:41:32.300
 Is it at least possible that the fear of death,

1:41:32.300 --> 1:41:36.300
 the terror of your mortality is the creative force

1:41:36.300 --> 1:41:39.020
 that created all of the things around us

1:41:39.020 --> 1:41:41.540
 at this human civilization?

1:41:41.540 --> 1:41:45.020
 And I think about from an engineering perspective,

1:41:45.020 --> 1:41:49.220
 this is where I lose all of my robotics colleagues

1:41:49.220 --> 1:41:52.580
 is I feel like if you want to create intelligence,

1:41:52.580 --> 1:41:57.580
 you have to also engineer in some kind of echoes

1:41:58.140 --> 1:41:59.740
 of this kind of fear.

1:42:01.580 --> 1:42:03.420
 Fear is such a complicated word,

1:42:03.420 --> 1:42:06.860
 but it's kind of like a scarcity,

1:42:06.860 --> 1:42:10.540
 a scarcity of time, a scarcity of resources

1:42:10.540 --> 1:42:12.500
 that creates a kind of anxiety,

1:42:12.500 --> 1:42:15.460
 like deadlines get you to do stuff.

1:42:15.460 --> 1:42:18.460
 And there's something almost fundamental to that

1:42:18.460 --> 1:42:21.460
 in terms of human experience.

1:42:21.460 --> 1:42:22.660
 Yeah, well, that's an interesting thought.

1:42:22.660 --> 1:42:27.660
 So you're basically in order to create a kind of structure

1:42:30.940 --> 1:42:34.300
 that mirrors what we call consciousness.

1:42:34.300 --> 1:42:38.820
 You'd better have that structure confront the same kinds

1:42:38.820 --> 1:42:41.980
 of issues and terrors that we do.

1:42:41.980 --> 1:42:44.180
 Consciousness and suffering only makes sense

1:42:44.180 --> 1:42:45.620
 in the context of death.

1:42:45.620 --> 1:42:48.100
 If you want to, I feel like,

1:42:48.100 --> 1:42:50.740
 if you want to fit into human society,

1:42:50.740 --> 1:42:54.420
 if you're a robot and if you want to fit into human society,

1:42:54.420 --> 1:42:59.100
 you better have the same kind of existential dread,

1:42:59.100 --> 1:43:00.740
 the same kind of fear of mortality,

1:43:00.740 --> 1:43:02.340
 otherwise you're not gonna fit in.

1:43:02.340 --> 1:43:03.180
 Right.

1:43:03.180 --> 1:43:04.020
 Right.

1:43:04.020 --> 1:43:06.180
 That's good.

1:43:06.180 --> 1:43:09.580
 It might be wild, but it's at least,

1:43:09.580 --> 1:43:11.380
 like we're talking about all the theories

1:43:11.380 --> 1:43:13.700
 that are at least worth consideration.

1:43:13.700 --> 1:43:15.780
 I think that's a really powerful one.

1:43:15.780 --> 1:43:19.180
 And definitely one has resonated with me

1:43:19.180 --> 1:43:23.300
 and definitely seems to capture something

1:43:25.700 --> 1:43:30.700
 beautifully like real about the human condition.

1:43:31.340 --> 1:43:34.180
 And I wonder, it's of course,

1:43:34.180 --> 1:43:38.260
 it sucks to think that we need death to appreciate life,

1:43:40.340 --> 1:43:43.180
 but that's just maybe the way it is.

1:43:43.180 --> 1:43:44.500
 Well, it's interesting if this robotic

1:43:44.500 --> 1:43:49.420
 or artificially intelligent system understands the world

1:43:49.420 --> 1:43:51.700
 and understands the second law of thermodynamics

1:43:51.700 --> 1:43:55.540
 and entropy, even an artificial intelligence will realize

1:43:55.540 --> 1:43:59.220
 that even if its parts are really robust,

1:43:59.220 --> 1:44:02.380
 ultimately it will disintegrate.

1:44:02.380 --> 1:44:03.220
 Yeah.

1:44:03.220 --> 1:44:05.180
 The timescales may be different,

1:44:05.180 --> 1:44:06.980
 but in a way, when you think about it, it doesn't matter.

1:44:06.980 --> 1:44:09.220
 Once you know that you are mortal

1:44:09.220 --> 1:44:11.580
 in the sense that you are not eternal,

1:44:11.580 --> 1:44:13.740
 the timescale hardly matters

1:44:13.740 --> 1:44:17.940
 because it's either the whole thing or not.

1:44:17.940 --> 1:44:19.740
 Because on the scales of eternity,

1:44:19.740 --> 1:44:23.700
 any finite duration, however large is effectively zero

1:44:23.700 --> 1:44:25.580
 on the scales of eternity.

1:44:25.580 --> 1:44:28.820
 And so maybe it won't be so hard for an artificial system

1:44:28.820 --> 1:44:32.020
 to feel that sense of mortality

1:44:32.020 --> 1:44:35.220
 because it will recognize the underlying physical laws

1:44:35.220 --> 1:44:38.540
 and recognize its own finitude.

1:44:38.540 --> 1:44:41.340
 And then it'll be us and robots drinking beers,

1:44:41.340 --> 1:44:43.620
 looking up at the stars and just,

1:44:48.500 --> 1:44:51.100
 having a good laugh in awe of the whole thing.

1:44:51.100 --> 1:44:51.940
 Yeah.

1:44:53.140 --> 1:44:55.500
 I think that's a pretty good way to end it,

1:44:55.500 --> 1:44:57.340
 talking about the fear of death.

1:44:57.340 --> 1:44:59.820
 We started talking about the meaning of life

1:44:59.820 --> 1:45:01.060
 and ended on the fear of death.

1:45:01.060 --> 1:45:03.140
 Brian, this is an incredible conversation.

1:45:03.140 --> 1:45:03.980
 My pleasure, thank you.

1:45:03.980 --> 1:45:04.820
 I enjoyed it enormously.

1:45:04.820 --> 1:45:05.660
 I really, really enjoyed it.

1:45:05.660 --> 1:45:06.700
 It's been a long time coming.

1:45:06.700 --> 1:45:09.700
 I'm a huge fan of your work, a huge fan of your writing.

1:45:09.700 --> 1:45:10.700
 Thanks for talking to me, Brian.

1:45:10.700 --> 1:45:12.060
 Thank you.

1:45:12.060 --> 1:45:13.580
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

1:45:13.580 --> 1:45:14.780
 with Brian Greene.

1:45:18.900 --> 1:45:22.940
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Bill Bryson.

1:45:22.940 --> 1:45:25.500
 "'Physics is really nothing more

1:45:25.500 --> 1:45:27.860
 "'than a search for ultimate simplicity.

1:45:27.860 --> 1:45:32.860
 "'But so far, all we have is a kind of elegant messiness.'"

1:45:32.860 --> 1:45:57.860
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
