00:00.000 --> 00:06.900
 Humans are fascinated by violence and you've got to ask yourself. Why is it the rash guard? Yes

00:07.320 --> 00:12.700
 And I talk so much shit that I'm like man if I lose this is gonna be rough. You're learning this shut the fuck up

00:12.700 --> 00:16.260
 I got you man. You were powered by McDonald's and Coca Cola

00:16.260 --> 00:20.740
 I want more and then I expect them and he didn't want to fight anymore. I'm not impressed by

00:22.060 --> 00:24.060
 if George st. Pierre and

00:24.060 --> 00:29.560
 And Khabib Nurmagomedov face each other in their prime who wins? I'm

00:31.520 --> 00:39.860
 Here with three individuals each of whom are considered by many to be the greatest of all time in each of their respective disciplines

00:40.240 --> 00:46.760
 The greatest MMA fighter of all time George st. Pierre the greatest martial arts coach of all time

00:47.200 --> 00:49.200
 John Donahue and

00:49.620 --> 00:51.960
 the greatest submission grappler of all time

00:51.960 --> 00:53.960
 Gordon Ryan

00:54.700 --> 00:59.060
 So, let me ask the first question. You guys didn't see the question. No preparation here

00:59.340 --> 01:03.820
 What is the key to your success each of you one thing or multiple things that come to mind?

01:05.780 --> 01:07.780
 John go first

01:12.340 --> 01:14.340
 Is it the rash guard

01:15.060 --> 01:17.060
 Yes, I

01:17.060 --> 01:21.420
 I like that you choose John right off the bat. I seem the most nervous

01:26.020 --> 01:28.020
 For me it's about

01:29.700 --> 01:31.700
 Finding a way to work in

01:32.100 --> 01:36.380
 A world where most of the answers are already known

01:37.020 --> 01:44.340
 Okay, and in any developed sport by the time you enter that sport most of the basic precepts the

01:44.340 --> 01:50.980
 the the major techniques that the major mechanical understandings of the sport are long since worked out and

01:51.580 --> 01:52.820
 so

01:52.820 --> 01:54.820
 in a highly developed world

01:56.740 --> 02:00.080
 The key to success is to be able to identify

02:01.580 --> 02:06.660
 Some area of the industry that you're in which is currently undervalued

02:07.680 --> 02:09.680
 To do what the other people are not doing

02:10.460 --> 02:12.460
 deeper than that you're

02:12.460 --> 02:18.680
 Everyone has a view of okay. These are the the main skills of the industry. I work in

02:19.680 --> 02:21.680
 at any given time

02:21.920 --> 02:24.600
 some set of skills attributes

02:26.480 --> 02:30.880
 Will always be somewhat undervalued they're underappreciated by the people in the game

02:32.440 --> 02:38.440
 You see that at any in any given industry there are always trends which change

02:38.440 --> 02:42.080
 The nature of the industry over time so

02:43.280 --> 02:47.520
 fashion trends in the clothing industry, you'll see at any given time is a

02:49.040 --> 02:54.700
 General wave of fashion which pushes most of the people in the industry in a given direction at a given time

02:55.840 --> 03:04.040
 What makes people stand out is the ability to look at the various possibilities out there and say here is something which is genuinely

03:04.040 --> 03:11.360
 useful, but which is currently being underused underutilized and I want to bring that back in and

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
 develop it and

03:14.560 --> 03:17.400
 Because it's an inherently useful product

03:17.960 --> 03:23.540
 It will be very very successful in its initial applications against people who aren't currently using it

03:27.000 --> 03:31.960
 If you can do this in whatever industry you're in I believe you'll be highly successful

03:31.960 --> 03:36.120
 successful to the supplies both for actual specific like techniques and

03:37.120 --> 03:39.600
 the also tactics as well in the case of

03:40.480 --> 03:45.800
 Jiu Jitsu, so for example in my sport leg locks have always been around

03:46.000 --> 03:50.420
 Okay, there's there's no shortage of people you can look back in history who applying leg locks

03:51.120 --> 03:54.240
 Nonetheless as in across the industry

03:54.680 --> 04:00.540
 Leg locks were undervalued and underappreciated. There was a general sense in which most of the leading figures of the sport

04:00.540 --> 04:06.300
 For most of the history of the sport of Jiu Jitsu tended to deemphasize leg locks and

04:08.180 --> 04:15.580
 When I looked at them I said there was immense potential but it wasn't being realized and needed to be changed

04:16.860 --> 04:23.460
 Since then that has more or less occurred now most people coming into the sport understand that leg locks are an important

04:23.980 --> 04:28.860
 Aspect and they're no longer undervalued if anything it's gone too far the other way and now perhaps they're a little overvalued

04:28.860 --> 04:30.340
 and

04:30.340 --> 04:31.500
 the

04:31.500 --> 04:33.220
 this kind of

04:33.220 --> 04:36.180
 fashion trend exists in every industry and

04:37.260 --> 04:41.580
 The job of anyone who wants to excel in a given industry is to be able to identify

04:41.780 --> 04:46.260
 okay, what are the things that are currently out of fashion and undervalued and then

04:47.100 --> 04:51.560
 Look at what is their actual objective value and then work

04:52.260 --> 04:56.740
 To to to bring them back to the forefront. So John brought up fashion

04:56.740 --> 05:00.100
 George is wearing a really sexy shirt. So

05:01.140 --> 05:03.140
 Assuming that's not the reason is there

05:03.580 --> 05:08.140
 Is there something that comes to mind as the key to the success of your incredible career?

05:08.140 --> 05:14.860
 Well, of course everybody knows the famous and sort of every athletes are saying oh, it's could be genetic

05:14.860 --> 05:18.860
 I was maybe gifted that certain predisposition. I worked really hard

05:19.700 --> 05:21.660
 but I think

05:21.660 --> 05:23.340
 something that

05:23.340 --> 05:28.380
 People don't talk enough is when everybody sometime go, right? I

05:29.580 --> 05:35.980
 Was never afraid to try to go left and I felt many time trying to do things that were not

05:39.540 --> 05:44.940
 Known to be things that would bring me brought me success, but I tried it, you know

05:44.940 --> 05:50.780
 I was very often I was the first of trying new things and I felt many time but certain times

05:50.780 --> 05:54.460
 it gives me a certain advantage and

05:55.620 --> 05:57.300
 for example, I

05:57.300 --> 06:03.860
 was sometime fighting guys that add much better wrestling background and than me on paper and

06:04.340 --> 06:09.600
 nobody before that fought those guys never nobody had there to try to

06:10.580 --> 06:16.020
 Take them down because their wrestling pedigree were so good and I didn't have on paper

06:16.020 --> 06:21.520
 the wrestling pedigree to take these guys down in a fight, but when everybody

06:23.460 --> 06:28.580
 Tried to go right I was going left I fought them in a different way and that was

06:29.300 --> 06:33.660
 The blueprint to beat certain some of these guys, you know what I mean? You know what I mean?

06:33.660 --> 06:37.700
 So yeah, so we'll actually talk about a few fights where that you did just that this is fascinating

06:38.220 --> 06:42.700
 But let's say at the high level so Gordon again sticking on fashion

06:42.700 --> 06:47.020
 I may compliment your incredible badass hat trying to fit in here

06:48.940 --> 06:51.340
 We should say we're in Texas now, so he's

06:52.300 --> 06:58.560
 Become a Texan overnight. So what is there something you can speak to that you would attribute to as the key to your success?

06:58.580 --> 07:02.580
 yeah, so first of all, it has to be a role where you don't ask us all those same questions because

07:03.500 --> 07:05.580
 How am I supposed to compete with the answer? John just gave

07:06.420 --> 07:12.260
 There's nothing I can do that's gonna top that. Yeah, but uh, I think it's uh, there's many things

07:12.260 --> 07:14.260
 But I think the number one thing is just is John

07:14.740 --> 07:19.540
 When I came in, I was a blue belt and I was beating brown and black belts in competition already

07:20.540 --> 07:23.860
 But he really changed my way of thinking about the sport

07:23.860 --> 07:25.860
 I would just come in and if something wasn't working

07:25.860 --> 07:33.260
 I would just do it harder and faster and more aggressively and that just degenerated me into a degenerated into me

07:33.820 --> 07:39.140
 spastically knee sliding into cross hashi garami against Eddie Cummings for six months and then just getting heel hooked repeatedly and

07:39.140 --> 07:43.460
 I'm like, this is not working and Eddie like when I met him was like a chubby

07:43.940 --> 07:48.880
 Librarian looking guy and I'm like, there's no I'm like six to like a jacked like 170 and I'm like

07:48.880 --> 07:52.760
 There's no way I'm losing to a guy who looks like this, but he just kept heel hooking me

07:52.760 --> 07:55.860
 So I would just go harder and harder and it wouldn't work and then John's like well

07:56.180 --> 07:59.940
 If you learned leg locks, you might you might have some more success

07:59.940 --> 08:02.300
 And then I was like, yeah, that probably makes sense

08:02.300 --> 08:07.740
 And from then on I kind of just changed the way I thought about the sport instead of doing doing things harder

08:07.740 --> 08:12.500
 I would actually try to get better at jujitsu. Do you remember like a turning point where?

08:13.780 --> 08:19.340
 You became as opposed to being mediocre not just in technique but an approach to

08:20.700 --> 08:26.780
 To great. Um, I think it was somewhere around brown belt level when I was training consistently

08:26.780 --> 08:32.820
 So I trained full time with John when I was purple belt mid level purple belt and towards the end of my brown belt

08:32.820 --> 08:38.220
 Days, I was beating up like legitimate like ADCC champions in the gym. Um,

08:38.780 --> 08:40.200
 so I think like

08:40.200 --> 08:42.600
 Brown to black belt was a big thing for me

08:42.600 --> 08:47.820
 And then when I won my first EBI and I was I submitted Yuri who won ADCC and I beat roost them

08:47.820 --> 08:50.380
 Um, so I think that was like my turning point as a competitor

08:50.740 --> 08:54.820
 But I think I started to to reach world level a little bit before that

08:54.820 --> 08:57.180
 I think somewhere around brown belt mid level to late level brown belt

08:57.180 --> 09:03.620
 It was some of that mental like it was there a moment when you like after a training session you realize

09:03.620 --> 09:05.620
 I can actually do this

09:05.620 --> 09:08.920
 Like I could be at the top of the world world class

09:09.120 --> 09:12.340
 The critical moment for me was when I think it was right

09:12.840 --> 09:15.960
 Right when I got my black belt, maybe a few months before I got my black belt

09:16.440 --> 09:19.960
 we had a former ADCC champion come into the gym and

09:20.700 --> 09:24.560
 we did a hard round together and I think I submitted them like four or five times and

09:24.560 --> 09:29.080
 No one knew who I was. I never won anything up into that point and I was like, okay

09:29.080 --> 09:33.440
 Like if this is like one of the best guys in the world and I could submit him multiple times around

09:33.440 --> 09:39.220
 I think that this is like something that I actually could do professionally and make a make a career out of this

09:40.080 --> 09:48.040
 Okay. So the actual performance was the like you don't need to believe before you could perform like a lot of Olympic gold medalists

09:48.960 --> 09:50.040
 they

09:50.040 --> 09:56.520
 They have to believe before they can perform because like they're getting their ass kicked for a long long long time

09:56.720 --> 09:57.200
 Yeah

09:57.200 --> 09:59.600
 I think but the best way for me to believe in something is to have

09:59.840 --> 10:02.280
 Repeated success doing it against high level guys

10:02.280 --> 10:05.620
 Like I'm not gonna just believe I can do a double leg if I can't a double leg on anybody

10:06.040 --> 10:10.280
 So for me the the belief came from the repeated success in the gym

10:10.600 --> 10:16.260
 Yeah, but to get to the point where you're submitting somebody like your ASMO is like one of the the greatest grapplers ever

10:17.280 --> 10:19.080
 It's like a long journey

10:19.080 --> 10:21.320
 Yeah, but I had the confidence

10:21.320 --> 10:26.000
 I had the belief in myself because of the success that I had in the gym prior to that got it

10:26.640 --> 10:31.880
 Even and it's one step at a time first. It's the brown belts then it's the black belts and it's world class. Okay

10:32.520 --> 10:37.200
 George was there a turning point for you when you you thought like I can actually do this

10:37.960 --> 10:42.200
 Yes, I I always dreamed to become champion

10:42.720 --> 10:46.800
 but I think the turning point that there was that there was two turning point and

10:46.800 --> 10:48.800
 And there were my two losses

10:50.320 --> 10:54.600
 First my losses to Matt Hughes I went into that fight

10:56.240 --> 11:03.560
 Just to not lose I was not fighting to win and it's after the fight when I watched the

11:04.600 --> 11:08.000
 Replay of the fight. I realized I was like I was doing pretty well

11:08.000 --> 11:12.880
 But during the fight in my own mind, I was not seeing it that way

11:12.880 --> 11:20.040
 I I thought I was getting dominated by Hughes like a hundred percent, but when I watched the replay I

11:20.800 --> 11:27.080
 Was like man, I can I can beat this guy. I was beating him until I made that stupid mistake

11:27.080 --> 11:30.040
 so I was very frustrating but but I

11:31.160 --> 11:36.720
 That's what gave me the mentally the the championship level

11:36.720 --> 11:43.760
 mentality and then I became a little bit overconfident because I start beating everybody after that and

11:44.360 --> 11:45.480
 I

11:45.480 --> 11:50.320
 Start to believe the hype of people when they look at me. They were like, oh, he's the new

11:51.160 --> 11:57.120
 Upcoming superstar and he's gonna be unstoppable and and then when I became champion, I I

11:58.000 --> 12:01.560
 lost to to to Matt to Matt Sarah, so

12:02.400 --> 12:04.200
 before I believe

12:04.200 --> 12:08.080
 my first failure was because I had a lack of confidence and

12:09.120 --> 12:10.600
 and

12:10.600 --> 12:17.160
 My second failure was I was because I was overconfidence. So I think it's there's a perfect

12:18.160 --> 12:23.840
 Center of confidence. I mean, I mean it's good to be confident because John taught me like confidence

12:23.840 --> 12:28.400
 It's it's like money in your bank account if you you can have all the skills in the world, right?

12:28.400 --> 12:30.000
 and and if you're

12:30.000 --> 12:35.160
 If you don't have the confidence, it's like you it's like you can you can be a millionaire?

12:35.160 --> 12:40.840
 But you don't have access to your bank account. So it's that's a little bit the analogy that John told me

12:40.840 --> 12:44.960
 So that's how I feel a confidence plays for Natalie but to be overconfident

12:44.960 --> 12:50.360
 I think it's always good to to be aware to be afraid of what can happen

12:50.760 --> 12:56.000
 So to have a perfect balance of confidence and fear to me

12:56.000 --> 13:02.880
 That's what mentally gave me the edge to become I believe successful in my sport playing off that

13:03.440 --> 13:07.040
 John gave me a speech one time and he was like you have to be able to

13:08.160 --> 13:14.040
 like flip a switch and turn it off where like a guy like Mayweather or someone who goes out who's super confident and

13:14.720 --> 13:17.620
 He plays the character of someone who's like no one can beat me

13:17.620 --> 13:20.000
 I'm the best that there ever was and that's it

13:20.400 --> 13:22.280
 But if you look at me actually trained very hard

13:22.280 --> 13:27.240
 You can't you can't play the persona of no one can beat me and have it translate into your life and just think that you're

13:27.240 --> 13:29.600
 So good that you don't have to do anything and no one can ever beat you

13:29.600 --> 13:32.720
 You have to be able to play that public persona of no one can beat me

13:32.720 --> 13:35.920
 But then you have to actually do the training to make that happen

13:35.920 --> 13:40.040
 You can't just you can't believe your own hype and say say that you know, I can just do whatever I want

13:40.040 --> 13:45.640
 No one's ever gonna beat me if the able to switch between the persona and the actual athlete and that made a big difference for me

13:45.960 --> 13:47.720
 it's tough because

13:47.720 --> 13:52.680
 like you're you you dominate such a large fraction of the world and

13:53.440 --> 13:54.920
 grappling and

13:54.920 --> 13:58.400
 The George to just the perfect dominance after those two

13:59.480 --> 14:01.600
 it's hard for the confidence not to just

14:03.280 --> 14:07.760
 Like how do you avoid the confidence not becoming a thing that weighs you down where you completely

14:09.120 --> 14:11.120
 deludes your mind

14:11.640 --> 14:15.120
 For me, it's just number one the guys in the gym are so tough

14:15.120 --> 14:20.440
 So the guys in the guys in the gym that I train with are always like nipping at my butt and always giving me new

14:20.440 --> 14:25.420
 New problems to solve and for me, it's really just about trying to learn new stuff over time

14:25.720 --> 14:28.280
 So that keeps it interesting for me and it's not really about

14:29.880 --> 14:33.120
 You know, no one could beat me I don't have to train or have to do it I could do whatever I want

14:33.280 --> 14:38.600
 It's more what keeps me in the gym is more about the fact that I'm learning new stuff all the time of working on something

14:38.600 --> 14:40.600
 new and progressing to new levels at all times

14:40.840 --> 14:43.840
 it's not I don't just come in and do the same thing over and over again and

14:43.840 --> 14:49.360
 That gets boring you just come in and you don't learn anything new and you just do the same stuff for years at a time

14:49.360 --> 14:50.360
 And okay, okay

14:50.360 --> 14:50.920
 This is boring

14:50.920 --> 14:56.000
 But when you have new stuff to work on and new goals short term and long term goals to reach then it makes it interesting

14:56.600 --> 14:57.760
 it's a

14:57.760 --> 15:04.720
 For me, it's a little bit like Gordon says is the fear because sometime in the gym even before I when it was competing

15:04.720 --> 15:06.720
 I was I was getting my butt kicked

15:06.840 --> 15:08.920
 But I don't care what happened in the gym

15:08.920 --> 15:13.520
 I mean it hit my ego, of course because I'm a proud person I'm a competitor even in the gym

15:13.520 --> 15:20.440
 but it's not a malicious competition competition in between each other when you fight you have to be malicious you go there to hurt the

15:20.440 --> 15:21.160
 guy

15:21.160 --> 15:25.540
 but it it hit it hit me in terms of my pride when I get

15:26.240 --> 15:28.520
 beat in a gym, of course, but

15:29.200 --> 15:31.200
 that fear

15:31.360 --> 15:34.560
 That I don't want it to happen in public

15:34.880 --> 15:41.640
 especially not during a fight that what keeps help me keeps the balance between confidence and and and and fear

15:41.640 --> 15:44.000
 You know what? I mean? It's kind of weird. It's a mix

15:44.440 --> 15:49.100
 It's a mixture of both that I believe I to me

15:49.760 --> 15:51.280
 Help me

15:51.280 --> 15:57.240
 Succeed to have the right mindset to fight and I talk so much shit that I'm like man if I lose this

15:57.400 --> 16:01.440
 This is gonna be rough. So yeah, you put a lot of I mean

16:01.440 --> 16:05.880
 that's that's the hard thing to do when you talk shit when you when you play the heel is

16:05.880 --> 16:11.320
 Is so massive perform. He's the pressure is I mean you have to be good under pressure

16:11.480 --> 16:18.080
 It's the Conor McGregor thing, you know, the reason I actually started talking shit was actually like indirectly because of George

16:19.040 --> 16:20.080
 because

16:20.080 --> 16:22.640
 Because I will become the opposite of George

16:22.640 --> 16:28.680
 I won I won my first DBI and I I didn't talk shit and everyone was like being like, oh, you know

16:28.680 --> 16:31.960
 you only beat Yuri because because he was tired or

16:31.960 --> 16:37.200
 you know this or that and if they have a rematch under any of the rules that he would have lost and

16:37.520 --> 16:39.320
 I'm like trying to figure out what I'm gonna do

16:39.320 --> 16:45.600
 So I'm strolling through George's feed one day and he posted a clip of him beating someone and I look at the comments

16:45.600 --> 16:48.840
 And I'm with this in mind. I'm like George is the nicest person of all time

16:48.840 --> 16:52.440
 and if you look at the comments, it's like 10,000 comments and like

16:52.960 --> 16:58.240
 9,000 and 900 are just people calling him like all you do is lay and pray you pussy

16:58.240 --> 17:03.400
 You suck you can't finish anybody and I'm just like I'm looking at this and I'm like people are gonna say

17:03.760 --> 17:09.280
 What they're gonna say regardless, they're gonna talk shit regardless. So you may as well just say whatever you want and then just be yourself

17:10.480 --> 17:16.380
 Is there some aspect that's I mentioned Conor McGregor. He he crossed the line with Khabib

17:17.000 --> 17:18.520
 At least in the eyes of Khabib

17:18.520 --> 17:24.280
 Is there something you ever regret about crossing a line or does that you ever feel like there's a line?

17:24.320 --> 17:26.320
 Or do you just keep pushing the line?

17:26.320 --> 17:30.160
 Uh, I basically play it per per person

17:30.160 --> 17:36.920
 I just I basically fire back with like one step above what what they do. It's always plus one. Yeah. Yeah, okay

17:38.560 --> 17:41.740
 So I go I usually go hard like they fire a bullet then I drop a Duke

17:42.200 --> 17:47.440
 And then and then after that initial shot then we go back and forth and I'll just keep one upping them

17:47.800 --> 17:53.760
 So, you know, there's a lot of people that love you, but there's also a lot of people that love to hate you. Yeah

17:53.760 --> 17:59.560
 it's so like what do those people like energize you or do you just

18:00.520 --> 18:05.320
 Or is it funny to you? Like what as an athlete as a performer? You should not think about them

18:05.320 --> 18:06.520
 It's like a fun thing

18:06.520 --> 18:08.720
 It's like it's just like a fun thing that keeps me occupied

18:09.320 --> 18:14.560
 Like because like because most of them that like talk shit they like just say stuff that's factually incorrect

18:14.600 --> 18:18.540
 So then I just argue with like actual statistics. Yeah, it's just like

18:19.160 --> 18:23.040
 You suck or you're not gonna beat this person. I'm like, I've already submitted that guy

18:23.040 --> 18:28.340
 Yeah, so I just it riles them up and it's just it's just a fun thing for me to do my my downtime

18:28.380 --> 18:32.840
 Yeah, your responses are usually very factual. It's very scientific. I appreciate

18:33.440 --> 18:40.640
 Thank you. You actually you start by talking trash, but then you respond with science. Yeah, it's great. Okay. It's good mix. That's a good mix

18:41.000 --> 18:42.500
 I

18:42.500 --> 18:49.220
 Mean a topic of haters are more specifically sort of doubts within yourself of doubts around you as you're coming up

18:49.220 --> 18:55.320
 Maybe George you can comment. Oh, we're just ignoring John completely in this conversation. I

18:58.080 --> 19:01.360
 Was gonna ask you another question, but let me just ask you on this on this topic

19:02.080 --> 19:04.080
 Are there times in your life yet?

19:04.280 --> 19:08.400
 You were surrounded by people that that doubted you all the time

19:08.400 --> 19:13.360
 And so what is there something you could say as in by way of advice how you overcome?

19:13.360 --> 19:20.520
 The doubt either yourself or others around you all the time the first time I

19:21.240 --> 19:23.240
 Manifest my desire to become a professional

19:24.000 --> 19:26.880
 Mixed martial art athlete everybody doubt me

19:27.360 --> 19:31.440
 Just not even I'm not talking about the UFC just to become a professional fighter

19:31.440 --> 19:37.060
 Everybody doubt me and I became a I became a professional fighter. I had few amateur fight

19:37.060 --> 19:40.280
 I won them all then I I fought my first fight in

19:40.280 --> 19:43.520
 In Montreal, I won and I became a professional

19:44.200 --> 19:51.400
 Then I I told people that I wanted to fight in UFC. Everybody doubt me again. So it's a normal thing

19:52.520 --> 19:59.320
 So I work my way up beat a few guys then I at the time Pete Spratt was

20:00.000 --> 20:03.320
 just knocked knocked out Robbie Lawler with leg kick and

20:04.680 --> 20:07.520
 The person who was my agent at the time did a great move

20:07.520 --> 20:12.720
 For me, so he brought Pete Spratt in Montreal to fight me Pete Spratt came to Montreal

20:12.720 --> 20:15.680
 I and I believe he didn't know who I was

20:15.680 --> 20:20.600
 So he thought that he was coming to collect an easy paycheck and I and I end up beating him

20:20.600 --> 20:23.800
 So that gave me the opportunity to fight in UFC

20:24.480 --> 20:27.920
 Then after I was in UFC, I wanted to become champion of the world, you know

20:27.920 --> 20:31.560
 but Matthews was there and he seems invincible at the time so

20:31.560 --> 20:38.600
 Everybody doubt me again, and I became world champion and after when you when I was world champion, I wanted to be I

20:39.520 --> 20:43.800
 was competing against other world champion of other weight class

20:44.440 --> 20:50.840
 For the title, you know for the legacy and everything. So it's not no longer competing against my opponent

20:50.840 --> 20:57.200
 I was you know as a competitor you always you never wanted to be you never want to be satisfied because when

20:57.200 --> 21:02.680
 Satisfaction is the death, you know when you're satisfied you better retire because it's over

21:02.760 --> 21:10.560
 So always I have to find motivation what you can have more. I want more don't be satisfied in life. So I wanted to be

21:11.360 --> 21:14.680
 Like the best, you know, I want as I was competing, you know

21:14.680 --> 21:19.840
 Like to become the best and and you know, of course that people doubt doubt you all the time

21:19.880 --> 21:25.600
 Every time you say something that it's outside of the norm of the normality

21:25.600 --> 21:33.080
 I want to say there there's nothing normal, but I'm talking about when you you manifest your desire to do something that

21:33.920 --> 21:35.080
 takes

21:35.080 --> 21:40.540
 Special attribute to to to succeed or that is something that is hard to to do

21:40.540 --> 21:44.920
 It's for sure you're gonna always have people that doubt you it's so strange that people don't

21:45.280 --> 21:48.340
 They don't lean into supporting like people that love you, too

21:48.480 --> 21:54.440
 yeah, even people that love me used to doubt me and I believe I I you need to use that as

21:54.440 --> 21:56.280
 a

21:56.280 --> 22:00.240
 Positive positive thing as a motivation to prove them wrong

22:00.360 --> 22:05.560
 Yeah, so for me that that was a thing when someone doubt me nothing gave me more

22:06.320 --> 22:09.560
 There's more energy because I want to prove him wrong

22:09.560 --> 22:14.500
 I want to look at him in the face and say hey, you see I got you man. I I did it

22:14.960 --> 22:15.920
 so

22:15.920 --> 22:21.280
 John do you ever use this in one way or the other by saying I don't think you can do this to motivate them to

22:21.280 --> 22:24.560
 prove you wrong or more general question of

22:25.600 --> 22:31.760
 You know the mental toughness required to achieve or confidence required to achieve greatness

22:32.000 --> 22:37.440
 Like what's your role as a coach when you have these two athletes with regards to your your first question?

22:37.440 --> 22:44.060
 Would I ever say to someone you can't do this as a kind of reverse psychology? I know

22:44.060 --> 22:50.520
 My job is to prepare people first and foremost with their skills and

22:50.960 --> 22:53.880
 as Gordon pointed out earlier if you're

22:54.680 --> 23:01.240
 In any way a rational human being and you're noticing that you're getting tremendous success

23:01.640 --> 23:05.120
 with a given move in the gym against high level opponents who

23:05.840 --> 23:09.960
 Give a good read on what your actual opponent in a competition is like

23:09.960 --> 23:13.440
 You would have to be a moron to not

23:13.960 --> 23:21.600
 Recognize that kind of success and say this is something I should be building into my game and you will carry the confidence that

23:21.600 --> 23:23.600
 You earned in the gym into the arena

23:24.680 --> 23:28.720
 So I never try to use reverse psychology. I build up

23:30.360 --> 23:33.560
 Everything I do in terms of confidence is to give people physical skills

23:33.560 --> 23:41.480
 I know people say all this physicality on the one hand is mentality on the other and confidence is squarely in the the mental

23:41.480 --> 23:48.000
 Aspect of the game, but all the underpinnings and beginnings of confidence are physical

23:49.240 --> 23:55.280
 okay, a rational human being will see where they're having success and where they're having failure and

23:55.880 --> 23:57.760
 confidence will

23:57.760 --> 24:03.960
 Surround those areas where they're having success and will degenerate in cases where they're having failure

24:04.240 --> 24:10.600
 so my job as a coach is to set them up for success in the gym with a given set of skills and

24:10.920 --> 24:12.920
 I don't have to do anything

24:14.120 --> 24:16.120
 psychologically after that I just

24:16.920 --> 24:19.240
 If I can set you up to be highly successful

24:19.840 --> 24:25.000
 With a given move or a set of tactics ten times in a row against quality opposition in the gym

24:25.000 --> 24:29.080
 I don't have to do a damn thing when it comes to instilling confidence. I

24:29.680 --> 24:33.280
 Will tell people hey, you're doing a really good job with that move. It's working well for you

24:34.080 --> 24:35.560
 but

24:35.560 --> 24:39.400
 When they nod in agreement, I'm not trying to force anything on them

24:39.440 --> 24:43.440
 They're recognized they or they already recognized that long before the words came out of my mouth

24:44.120 --> 24:52.280
 but on the other hand intelligent rational people will recognize when they're failing with given moves and no amount of talk on my part can

24:52.280 --> 24:54.280
 ever change that if

24:54.280 --> 24:56.280
 I teach Gordon

24:57.040 --> 24:59.040
 a given arm lock and

24:59.640 --> 25:04.200
 15 times in a row. It tries it over a month and all 15 of failures

25:04.360 --> 25:08.080
 There's nothing I can say verbally to come up to go and say hey, you're really good at that move

25:08.080 --> 25:09.520
 He's gonna look at me say bullshit

25:09.520 --> 25:15.400
 I'm terrible at it and that will create a crisis of confidence where Gordon no longer believes the words coming out of my mouth

25:15.960 --> 25:22.120
 So I will never compromise that but isn't there a lot you just said 15 there you have to believe

25:22.120 --> 25:24.120
 that

25:24.840 --> 25:30.040
 Doing this arm lock 15 times over a period of a month is worth it because eventually you might get it

25:30.040 --> 25:33.560
 I think yeah, that's a separate issue that that's a separate issue

25:37.040 --> 25:44.560
 There are times where I've more or less pushed athletes to go in a certain direction for example

25:45.200 --> 25:47.520
 When I first met Gary tone and he never had a guillotine

25:47.520 --> 25:51.940
 Strangle and I I would say don't carry, you know, you're a scrambler

25:51.940 --> 25:57.780
 like one of the greatest weapons of scramble can ever develop as a guillotine like it should be in your arsenal and

25:58.660 --> 26:02.540
 He was like, yeah, I just grab off of the back and I said, well, there's gonna be a day

26:02.540 --> 26:07.420
 You can't take someone's back and it's always good to better strangle from front and back

26:07.660 --> 26:10.860
 Okay, of course, we all prefer a strangles on the back that makes sense

26:11.140 --> 26:14.220
 But there's gonna come a day where it's gonna be useful for you

26:14.220 --> 26:18.940
 and so that was one of the few times where I put my foot down and said you're learning this shut the fuck up and

26:20.660 --> 26:25.740
 Like literally wouldn't teach him any anything else until you got a guillotine. Yeah, Gary like asked him a question

26:25.740 --> 26:27.740
 he's like, let's say you're guillotine and

26:29.700 --> 26:36.340
 For the first three months as gifted as as Gary tone it is and learning most moves most moves Gary gets it like

26:36.860 --> 26:42.380
 in minutes, there was something going on with Gary just couldn't get a guillotine on people and

26:42.380 --> 26:49.580
 Finally after around three months, he started having some success until ultimately became one of his best weapons

26:50.780 --> 26:54.060
 We had to go through like 15 different variations of guillotine

26:54.540 --> 26:57.940
 until he found one which actually worked reliably for him and

26:58.500 --> 27:01.680
 That was one of the few times where I put my foot down and said no

27:01.900 --> 27:06.340
 Do you have to learn this the long search had to do more with the physical characteristics?

27:06.340 --> 27:12.740
 I couldn't figure out the right like it made sense. It made sense in the case of Gary tone because there were more opportunities per minute

27:12.740 --> 27:14.740
 Of his grappling for guillotines

27:15.260 --> 27:19.380
 The investment and time was worth it for another athlete. I might have said well

27:19.380 --> 27:24.300
 He hardly ever gets in the situation the front headlong so guillotine so it's not even worth investing the training time

27:24.980 --> 27:28.660
 Let me ask you a question on the on the competition side mentioned haters

27:28.660 --> 27:32.640
 And do you think about this aspect of the competition with athletes?

27:32.640 --> 27:36.320
 If there's a great question and the answer is no

27:38.680 --> 27:39.960
 I'm

27:39.960 --> 27:44.840
 You can see that you could you couldn't find two more polar opposites

27:45.680 --> 27:50.800
 psychologically than than George St. Pierre and this monstrosity on my left and

27:52.080 --> 27:59.220
 I've I've never said to my athletes. Hey, I think this is the sort of demeanor you should carry yourself with

27:59.220 --> 28:04.660
 I'm myself a very flawed character and I'm the last person on earth

28:04.660 --> 28:07.900
 Who should be delving out moral advice to other people?

28:08.820 --> 28:13.020
 The only thing is that I you know, of course, I believe some things are off limits

28:13.100 --> 28:18.660
 But as long as it's done in the context of sport with no one's physically attacking people or do anything crazy

28:18.660 --> 28:23.420
 Where it just goes completely over the top then I give almost zero

28:24.740 --> 28:27.500
 Moral advice to my athletes. I'm a jiu jitsu coach not a preacher

28:27.500 --> 28:29.500
 I

28:29.620 --> 28:31.540
 If I can if I may

28:31.540 --> 28:33.540
 We are entertainers

28:34.140 --> 28:37.460
 You know, we're athletes or professional athletes, but we make

28:38.460 --> 28:43.940
 We make a living because of people or want to see us perform

28:44.540 --> 28:48.420
 Same thing an actor or something a singer and a lot of the time

28:49.460 --> 28:51.460
 especially in the fight game

28:51.460 --> 28:57.820
 An event is promoted. It needs to be with emotion

28:58.940 --> 29:01.560
 Love me hate me, but do not ignore me

29:02.620 --> 29:04.220
 and

29:04.220 --> 29:05.680
 You know it

29:05.680 --> 29:07.680
 when it's authentic and

29:08.700 --> 29:14.260
 It's done. Well, I think me my personally my my favorite fighters to watch are the one that are that

29:14.740 --> 29:18.700
 That I that have a sort of some sort of a bad persona

29:18.700 --> 29:21.620
 I really enjoy watching those guys because

29:22.420 --> 29:26.540
 They bring an emotion element into a fight, which is great

29:26.540 --> 29:33.480
 You know, I I feel to me it's more interesting to watch when there is an emotion involved and I believe that's why

29:34.340 --> 29:38.220
 Some fighters make more money than others, you know, you know what I mean?

29:38.220 --> 29:41.520
 They would that's the reason why we may we can make a living out of this

29:41.520 --> 29:47.580
 Yeah, they're better entertainers, but you're right. The authenticity seems to be really important. There's actually something very interesting there

29:47.580 --> 29:50.480
 It's time to break out some some secrets

29:52.380 --> 29:57.620
 Do you know who like you think of George St. Pierre you think of like the highly technical polished

29:58.860 --> 30:05.340
 Martial artists. Oh, this is gonna be great. Do you know who his favorite fighters to watch were?

30:06.060 --> 30:10.220
 You'd probably be thinking of probably someone who's really technically advanced

30:10.820 --> 30:16.180
 Actually, it was Mark Coleman. Oh, no, Kevin Randleman and Phil Barone

30:16.180 --> 30:22.100
 He used to love watching that was a hammer house. That was his favorite. He would love those guys and

30:22.900 --> 30:26.340
 whenever their fights were on georgie watching the hammer house crew and

30:27.980 --> 30:32.940
 It's funny what you said about how those guys bought an intensity to

30:33.620 --> 30:37.140
 To MMA that was off the charts. Have you ever met those guys in?

30:38.340 --> 30:42.260
 And in their prime, let me tell you it was it was something to behold and

30:42.260 --> 30:46.420
 I had this crazy larger than life personality

30:47.260 --> 30:49.420
 Most of the things I did made no sense whatsoever

30:49.620 --> 30:56.020
 But I mean technically but that was their appeal and they were these guys and George loved to watch them more than anyone else

30:56.120 --> 31:01.220
 You never know what what could happen with these guys. I remember when Mark Coleman won the Pride Grand Prix

31:01.220 --> 31:04.780
 I was in my living room. I was jumping I was so happy. I was like, yeah

31:04.780 --> 31:11.660
 Yeah, he beat Igor Vorchevchin. That was like I like for to me. It was amazing. You know what I mean?

31:12.260 --> 31:16.860
 Because of the emotion that they brought into the fight George is actually very

31:17.740 --> 31:20.580
 interested by something you said that normally when I

31:21.940 --> 31:24.420
 Ask what is the appeal of a given fighter?

31:25.180 --> 31:32.260
 And what makes people watch a fight you talked about the idea that fighters entertain us and that's absolutely correct that they are

31:32.260 --> 31:36.820
 It's this weird weird industry where you're you're

31:37.420 --> 31:42.820
 Both an athlete and an entertainer and you need to be successful in both regards to become

31:43.740 --> 31:46.220
 financially successful insofar as

31:47.300 --> 31:54.180
 Your favorite athletes to watch at least were people who are almost like the polar opposite of who you are

31:55.260 --> 31:58.700
 I've always said that most people if you look at

31:58.700 --> 32:02.740
 Say a million people watch a pay per view event

32:03.500 --> 32:07.340
 What percentage of those million people have a genuine?

32:08.180 --> 32:12.220
 technical understanding of what's happening as they watch a fight

32:12.980 --> 32:14.980
 It's tiny

32:15.380 --> 32:23.140
 It's absolutely tiny the vast majority of people who watch a professional fight have almost no

32:23.420 --> 32:25.420
 technical understanding of

32:25.420 --> 32:31.060
 What's going on in front of them? So how do they relate to the fight? What's the only way they can?

32:31.780 --> 32:33.780
 it's through emotion and

32:34.460 --> 32:39.820
 So when they get a sense that these two don't like each other then they can relate to the fight

32:40.340 --> 32:46.140
 But only a tiny percentage of people watching a given professional fight can relate to it on a technical level

32:46.820 --> 32:51.420
 The overwhelming majority will always form an emotional attachment to the fight

32:51.420 --> 32:56.140
 That's why when you see things shows that USC primetime, they never focus on

32:57.060 --> 33:01.260
 tactics and the techniques of the fight they focus on the emotional elements the

33:01.660 --> 33:05.180
 Preparation the view of their own family members as athletes get ready

33:05.220 --> 33:09.780
 It's always an emotional pull because that's how 99 percent of the viewers

33:09.980 --> 33:17.220
 Relate to the fight if I haven't think about chess, okay, if I have minimal knowledge of two world champions

33:17.220 --> 33:22.420
 Coming to fight each other in it or match up against each other in a game of chess

33:22.420 --> 33:28.300
 I know so little about chess tactics and I can't really form any kind of technical

33:29.220 --> 33:31.220
 appreciation of what's going on on the board

33:31.620 --> 33:36.940
 But if you tell me that these two chess players hate each other's guts and they've got a rivalry which goes back five years

33:37.020 --> 33:42.660
 And they've said this and that about each other in public then suddenly on my ears break up and I'm like, oh, okay

33:42.660 --> 33:44.660
 This sounds interesting

33:44.660 --> 33:51.540
 because I just don't have the the knowledge to appreciate what's going on on the board and a chess game to be able to

33:51.980 --> 33:53.900
 to appreciate the

33:53.900 --> 33:56.860
 The technical nuances of what they're doing. So any

33:57.860 --> 34:02.940
 Interest that I have in the chess match is going to have to come from some kind of emotional level because I'm just not qualified

34:03.140 --> 34:09.260
 To make technical assessments and that's exactly how it is in the case of both grappling and mixed martial arts

34:09.260 --> 34:15.220
 That's why the ones who evoke the most attention are always the ones who can form some kind of emotional appeal

34:15.380 --> 34:17.820
 Conor McGregor was the all time master of this. I

34:18.460 --> 34:20.460
 believe also

34:20.900 --> 34:22.900
 Emotion can be used as a weapon

34:23.780 --> 34:28.680
 For example, I've learned I've learned this from my favorite boxer is sugar a Leonard

34:29.380 --> 34:31.860
 Sugar a Leonard. I remember I was very young

34:31.860 --> 34:36.380
 So I watched his fight later when I was older, but I know that sugar a Leonard

34:36.380 --> 34:43.780
 Was the best boxer of his era to me personally and I don't think nobody could beat him

34:43.780 --> 34:50.300
 I think it was skill skill wise it was the best. However, when he fought in Montreal Roberto Duran

34:51.620 --> 34:53.620
 Roberto Duran

34:55.700 --> 35:01.780
 Made it in a way that Leonard became very emotional he wanted to stand in front of Duran and

35:01.780 --> 35:08.100
 fight a different fight that that he normally does because he wanted to show that he's a man and

35:09.140 --> 35:11.340
 He lost that fight, which was a mistake

35:12.140 --> 35:13.860
 so by

35:13.860 --> 35:21.200
 Then later on he beat Roberto Duran in quite easy, you know, the if the fair everybody remember the no mask thing

35:21.460 --> 35:23.460
 but my point is

35:23.460 --> 35:32.300
 Emotion can be used in a way that it can make your derail your opponent out of his game plan

35:32.300 --> 35:37.500
 And I felt a lot of my opponent trying to do that with me. So that's why I never got involved

35:37.500 --> 35:39.980
 that was my way to defend myself against

35:41.100 --> 35:45.700
 Some kind of bullying is to put like a like a shield in front but some other guy like

35:47.020 --> 35:53.180
 Gordon he expressed himself differently. Of course, there's a language barrier, but for him he's better

35:53.180 --> 35:54.460
 at

35:54.460 --> 35:58.460
 Given giving giving back that says he's a better counter attacker, you know

35:58.460 --> 36:01.500
 that's the way you respond to to to the aggression of

36:02.540 --> 36:09.100
 An emotional attack. I think everybody is different in that regards. What's interesting that John said that he doesn't

36:11.780 --> 36:16.820
 Study the tactics of this game or maybe you're not interested in the tactics of this game

36:16.900 --> 36:19.860
 Because it seems like this is more than just being an entertainer

36:19.860 --> 36:26.380
 It seems like it could be an effective part of the match. Yeah, I just feel like whatever investment you make in that is

36:27.900 --> 36:33.500
 It's going to get negligible rewards first of all, it's probably only going to pertain to one match in front of you rather than the

36:33.500 --> 36:35.500
 totality of your career and

36:36.020 --> 36:39.620
 Whatever gains you get out of psychological trickery and play

36:41.900 --> 36:43.900
 Typically

36:43.900 --> 36:50.660
 Don't last long you you've raised an excellent example with sugar rate Leonard. He did fight outside of his usual

36:51.820 --> 36:56.140
 manner in that regard, but rather than me try to tell someone hey

36:56.940 --> 36:58.540
 Behave like this before a fight

36:58.540 --> 37:02.980
 I would have been probably more forceful between rounds with an athlete and say no

37:02.980 --> 37:06.180
 No, you're fighting this fight the wrong way and that would have a much

37:06.940 --> 37:08.020
 more

37:08.020 --> 37:10.060
 beneficial impact on my athletes and

37:10.060 --> 37:14.580
 Psychological trickery before a fight. I believe another example of

37:16.100 --> 37:18.100
 Emotion that leads to failure is a

37:19.060 --> 37:26.500
 Jose Aldo against Connor McGregor. I think it was it was on purpose that Connor McGregor

37:26.500 --> 37:33.340
 Did this try to bait Aldo to become over aggressive to open himself because he's an excellent counter puncher puncher

37:34.140 --> 37:36.460
 That's what I believe. It made a mistake

37:36.460 --> 37:39.300
 There's another great one my match against cyborg

37:40.060 --> 37:43.340
 2018 no gi worlds where he didn't even try to win

37:43.340 --> 37:46.460
 He just like wanted to smack me in the face the whole time cuz he was so angry

37:46.460 --> 37:48.700
 I was talking shit to him before the match and

37:49.260 --> 37:51.900
 It was like the finals of the absolute it was like the biggest

37:52.260 --> 37:55.900
 Match of the weekend and he just didn't even try to pass my guard or do anything

37:55.900 --> 37:59.020
 He just wanted to hit me in the face and I was like sick. I just won

37:59.700 --> 38:04.940
 It was incredibly fresh. It's fascinating to watch like a grown man sort of lose

38:04.940 --> 38:05.940
 composure

38:05.940 --> 38:06.940
 Yeah

38:06.940 --> 38:12.220
 Gordon one thing I've always been very impressed with you and that's

38:13.820 --> 38:16.300
 No matter how heated talk gets

38:17.180 --> 38:22.180
 Before a match with you when you go out to grapple. You're absolutely cold

38:22.900 --> 38:25.700
 Like I've you've never gone into a match

38:26.420 --> 38:30.820
 carrying anything other than just cold blooded calculation and

38:30.820 --> 38:38.220
 You've always been able to separate very well the idea of words and deeds. And I think that's always been one of your

38:39.220 --> 38:44.460
 One of your strongest assets a way I often measure this is when a match is over

38:44.460 --> 38:48.620
 I will ask the athlete questions about the match and

38:49.180 --> 38:53.460
 If they can't answer the question, what were you doing in the fourth minute? Okay

38:53.460 --> 38:56.260
 What was that set up you used in in the third minute?

38:56.260 --> 39:03.180
 They got you into the Kimura law if they can't answer that that tells me they were just fighting on instincts and emotion

39:03.500 --> 39:05.740
 But with Gordon, it's like a logbook

39:07.260 --> 39:09.420
 It's like okay in the seventh minute you went for that

39:10.420 --> 39:13.380
 Judy Gatami set up from from on the left side

39:14.140 --> 39:18.300
 What were you thinking? He can always give an answer. He's absolutely stone cold

39:20.660 --> 39:22.660
 Speaking of emotion

39:22.660 --> 39:31.020
 Speaking of emotion Gordon you will potentially if you're healthy face Andre Galvao and the ADCC

39:31.540 --> 39:33.540
 coming up super fight

39:33.780 --> 39:38.740
 Who is Andre Galvao for people who don't know? Can you tell the story of your beef with?

39:39.940 --> 39:45.020
 The the emotional interaction with a man. Yeah, so Andre is

39:45.860 --> 39:49.260
 He's considered the greatest ADCC competitor of all time

39:50.020 --> 39:52.020
 multiple time black belt world champion

39:52.020 --> 39:56.380
 winningest ADCC champion ever he has six six gold medals and

39:57.540 --> 39:59.540
 I've been trying to compete against him

40:00.300 --> 40:05.020
 Pretty much forever like since I got my black belt in 2016. I've been trying to get matches with him

40:05.460 --> 40:10.660
 he was in the first DBI that I did and he ended up pulling out and that I've been trying to get matches with him and

40:12.060 --> 40:16.300
 He would always say no and give one reason or another and then

40:16.300 --> 40:23.300
 After the last ADCC, I was like, hey Andre said he was retiring after this after this

40:23.940 --> 40:29.660
 This competition so if he wants to retire, you know, he's he's the greatest ADCC competitor of all time

40:29.660 --> 40:34.740
 And I think it's great. But if he wants to compete and that's great. I was like super nice and then he started like

40:35.940 --> 40:37.940
 posting like passive aggressive Instagram

40:39.820 --> 40:41.220
 Captions and

40:41.220 --> 40:47.300
 then we started going back and forth in the internet and there was like one point where I saw him in person when he

40:47.940 --> 40:52.140
 Acknowledged he's like I understand like what you're doing like we're gonna pump this fight up and he was like totally on board

40:52.260 --> 40:57.620
 but then there must have been something that happened where like it changed from like him like going along with it to being like

40:57.620 --> 41:01.980
 Actually pissed and then there was that one night at flow where I went to go shake his hand

41:01.980 --> 41:07.220
 I mean he flipped me off and then he followed me backstage and started to try to fight me and then I smacked him and

41:07.220 --> 41:13.500
 Then he didn't want to fight anymore and then we've been going back. He's actually blocked me on Instagram now

41:13.500 --> 41:17.020
 So he just won't engage no one from Atos will engage now

41:17.020 --> 41:21.300
 But it's gonna be interesting how he how he shows up if he can keep it under control or not

41:21.460 --> 41:26.860
 Do you think how do you explain that level of emotion? Is this fear of losing your throne?

41:26.860 --> 41:30.500
 Is it or is it just a human being like with the cyborg just

41:31.180 --> 41:34.660
 Just becoming emotionally unstable. Well, it might just be me

41:34.660 --> 41:38.060
 I just have a way to get and get under people's skin. It's just I don't know

41:38.300 --> 41:42.420
 He's he's he was he was cool for a while and then I just I don't know it just

41:43.180 --> 41:48.940
 Then everyone gets like this. They're all so emotional by the time they actually step up to compete that it's pretty easy to read them

41:48.940 --> 41:54.900
 They're either so emotional that they want to actually come forward and and beat me like like Tim Sprague's is a perfect example at

41:54.900 --> 41:56.900
 ADCC I posted like

41:57.660 --> 42:00.360
 On my story on Instagram like ten minutes before a match

42:00.360 --> 42:06.820
 I said like what I'm gonna do to Tim Sprague's is gonna be criminal and he's like a very stally guy and he came

42:06.820 --> 42:09.220
 He saw that and then he came out and actually tried to fight me

42:09.220 --> 42:12.140
 Like he came and actually engaged my guard and I ended up submitting him

42:12.140 --> 42:17.540
 So it either has that effect or it has the effect where they know I've talked so much shit leading up to the match

42:17.820 --> 42:22.100
 That they're so afraid to lose that they just get super stally and they move away

42:22.100 --> 42:26.940
 So either has one effect where they come forward and they want to they want to beat me beat me or they want to just

42:26.940 --> 42:32.460
 They're so afraid of getting submitted that they know if they engage they're super cagey and they just back away and don't really do anything

42:32.780 --> 42:34.780
 Do you think this match happens?

42:35.500 --> 42:41.100
 There's a lot of variables and what I have to see how my stomach is and to if I'm actually gonna show up and compete

42:41.100 --> 42:44.720
 My stomach's healthy. I doubt that Andre will actually show up to compete

42:44.900 --> 42:48.260
 I've been trying to compete against him for six years and he hasn't done it

42:48.260 --> 42:54.340
 So there's no reason to think he would now is it possible for you to speak to where like your estimates are about your stomach?

42:54.340 --> 43:00.780
 Or is it too unclear for now still too early to tell I have this round of treatment that I'm doing until late February

43:00.780 --> 43:03.420
 And I'm pretty sure that I need to do the same test

43:03.420 --> 43:07.020
 They did initially to retest all my levels and then go from there

43:07.020 --> 43:11.340
 So I've been feeling a little bit better. Like it's not nearly as bad as it used to be

43:11.340 --> 43:15.180
 I was explaining to someone the other day like for the last four years

43:15.180 --> 43:18.660
 I would be so nauseous that every time I would walk into a new room

43:18.660 --> 43:22.640
 I'd have to actively locate a garbage can in case I have to throw up

43:22.640 --> 43:25.920
 So I'm like one step above that right now. I'm like doing a little bit better than that

43:26.280 --> 43:29.500
 So it's definitely getting a little bit better, but it's not it's not where it needs to be

43:30.680 --> 43:36.240
 Can we talk about diet for just a sec because both of you George and and Gordon?

43:36.960 --> 43:44.040
 Like suffered from stomach issues different kind and have arrived for now for different places

43:44.180 --> 43:46.480
 so can you maybe George speak to

43:46.480 --> 43:54.160
 The general question of what is the best diet for performance for training like what have you learned through your career about this?

43:54.160 --> 43:56.300
 Well, I think everybody is different

43:57.040 --> 43:59.040
 to me personally

44:00.040 --> 44:02.040
 I implement fasting

44:03.600 --> 44:06.840
 Time restricted eating and and prolonged fasting

44:07.240 --> 44:12.160
 What's the longest you've done so far? The longest I've done is five days. I do it quite often

44:12.160 --> 44:14.480
 I do I do four times a year. I do

44:14.480 --> 44:16.480
 three to five days

44:17.280 --> 44:19.280
 water fast

44:19.280 --> 44:25.320
 And I liked it. It helps me with inflammation. I think it boosts the immune system and

44:26.040 --> 44:32.520
 That this about the I read papers about about this and I it helps me also feel

44:33.160 --> 44:35.160
 Feel good. It's kind of

44:35.160 --> 44:38.720
 Tera very therapeutic to physical and mental just mental

44:38.720 --> 44:46.000
 It meant mental and physical because when I eat my when I break my fast and I sit at the table with with other people

44:46.720 --> 44:51.080
 It doesn't matter what I eat if we all eat the same thing. I always tell them

44:51.080 --> 44:58.680
 I said my food right now tastes better than all of yours, you know, because I you know, I I have that this

44:59.560 --> 45:05.900
 thing that I think I believe sometimes you need to put yourself into suffering to realize how

45:05.900 --> 45:07.500
 How

45:07.500 --> 45:10.260
 Pleasurable something is and I

45:11.820 --> 45:13.340
 Tent

45:13.340 --> 45:16.340
 Personally like diet wise I eat whatever I want

45:17.060 --> 45:20.540
 Whenever I want, I don't I no longer have any problem with this

45:21.420 --> 45:24.500
 but if I would have a competition coming up like

45:25.180 --> 45:28.420
 Knowing that I what I know now about my body I would

45:29.180 --> 45:31.020
 orient myself

45:31.020 --> 45:33.500
 more towards an animal based diet

45:33.500 --> 45:39.540
 That's because I've tried different things and that's the kind of diet that I believe helped me

45:40.420 --> 45:46.540
 Having less inflammation and feel better in terms of performance for for for doing something physical

45:46.540 --> 45:48.860
 So high protein high fat low carbs

45:49.540 --> 45:50.940
 well

45:50.940 --> 45:57.460
 This is is different between animal based diet and keto. I mean there is carbs. There is a lot of fruit

45:57.460 --> 46:00.580
 I got a lot of the the carbs from the fruit

46:00.580 --> 46:03.900
 Okay, a lot of organs organs. I

46:05.500 --> 46:09.300
 Know a little bit about paleontology and in the past

46:10.940 --> 46:13.980
 About you a prehistoric human and and I I know that

46:14.860 --> 46:19.820
 And not not only about that. I know because I have travels a certain place in the world

46:19.820 --> 46:25.940
 I want to visit the Maasai in Africa the hunter gatherer tribe and I know that when they kill an animal

46:25.940 --> 46:31.480
 They go for the organs first and I know a pretty most predatory animal. They do the same thing

46:31.480 --> 46:37.400
 So organs I believe is something that normally in our culture in the western part of the world

46:37.400 --> 46:40.080
 We don't really eat but it's something that is very nutritious

46:41.280 --> 46:44.040
 Have you been able to convince Gordon to try fasting?

46:46.040 --> 46:48.040
 Talk about diets

46:48.360 --> 46:53.300
 It's a different situation. I think for Gordon because he's an heavyweight. He doesn't want to lose weight

46:53.300 --> 46:59.440
 You know when the heavyweight the range of like my range was like I was a welterweight and middleweight

46:59.440 --> 47:06.720
 But the heavyweight it's like some of the guys that you compete can compete against their it might be 300 pounds. So if you lose weight

47:07.440 --> 47:09.560
 It's a it's a big problem. You know what I mean?

47:09.560 --> 47:14.360
 So and there is things that will work for me that might not works for Gordon, you know

47:14.360 --> 47:18.640
 So we have to make his own experience and and I told Gordon sometime when everybody goes left

47:18.640 --> 47:22.500
 You try to go right see how you feel with certain things experiment

47:22.500 --> 47:24.500
 Not not a topic

47:25.260 --> 47:27.260
 That's part of your optimization

47:27.740 --> 47:34.300
 Optimal performance formula. Well what I used to do before my stomach issues and for those of you listening who don't know I had

47:34.420 --> 47:36.420
 recurring staph infections in

47:36.460 --> 47:41.400
 2018 and I took a bunch of oral antibiotics and it just completely wiped out my stomach

47:41.400 --> 47:45.780
 So I just was diagnosed. It was misdiagnosed as gastroparesis

47:45.780 --> 47:51.660
 So for those of you messaging me on Instagram who are just watching Rogan asking me about my gastroparesis. That's not what I have

47:51.660 --> 47:56.500
 They misdiagnosed it and I did some other tests and for four years

47:56.500 --> 48:01.180
 I didn't even know what it was and then I got this I went to this doctor in California who?

48:02.060 --> 48:09.460
 Diagnosed me with H. Pylori and then a fungal and a bacterial overgrowth in my small intestines. So the issues in the small intestines

48:10.000 --> 48:12.060
 so what I used to do was I used to do like

48:12.540 --> 48:18.180
 Seasons where I'd have a very clean season where I was competing and I would have a lower body weight

48:18.180 --> 48:22.980
 And I would do like an offseason kind of like a bodybuilder where I would eat a lot more food and a little bit

48:23.100 --> 48:27.500
 Dirtier food and I would have cheeseburgers and pizza at nighttime to have the extra calories

48:27.980 --> 48:30.620
 But now I can't eat those foods because they upset my stomach

48:30.620 --> 48:34.440
 So now I pretty much just try to eat whatever I can and maintain the weight the best I can

48:35.060 --> 48:40.940
 Based on how my stomach feels. So right now it's like rice chicken eggs fish

48:41.700 --> 48:43.620
 vegetables fruits and

48:43.620 --> 48:45.700
 Pretty much nothing else like anything hard to digest

48:45.700 --> 48:52.260
 Anything spicy red meat fast food all that's all that's hard for me

48:52.540 --> 48:56.080
 Which sucks because in Texas things? Yeah barbecue

48:57.460 --> 49:00.940
 And I mean this diet is really important for you John I can tell

49:02.420 --> 49:09.020
 Like is it is that something you think about for athletes at all again, that's part of the I've to be honest with you

49:09.540 --> 49:11.540
 I've never seen any

49:11.900 --> 49:13.140
 measurable

49:13.140 --> 49:20.900
 Improvement in sports performance in jiu jitsu by change of diet. I do believe that diet is important for longevity and

49:21.460 --> 49:25.420
 Human beings and I do think it makes a difference, especially once you get past the age of 40

49:26.580 --> 49:28.580
 with regards longevity

49:28.820 --> 49:34.540
 For older athletes. I do believe it makes some difference. But my observation is in athletes and

49:35.140 --> 49:40.460
 In their youth and working up into their prime. I've seen athletes have the worst

49:41.140 --> 49:42.900
 diets

49:42.900 --> 49:48.820
 God bless Travis Stevens for that guy won Olympic silver medal basically on McDonald's and candy. Yeah

49:50.020 --> 49:54.860
 George St. Pierre for 80% of your career. You were powered by McDonald's and coca cola

49:55.380 --> 50:00.580
 To Gina Alfredo. That was my yeah, my meal of choice before a championship fight

50:01.060 --> 50:05.940
 Gordon for him his youth was just five guys hamburgers Gary Tonin the same thing

50:06.340 --> 50:11.980
 I've worked with Japanese judo players who smoked a pack of cigarettes a day and won Olympic gold medals

50:11.980 --> 50:16.320
 I've worked with Russian wrestlers who just ate

50:18.500 --> 50:23.360
 Whatever was put in front of them and their athletic performance was outstanding

50:24.220 --> 50:28.260
 I've worked with other guys who did have what would be considered a very clean diet and

50:28.600 --> 50:34.820
 Their performance was no better than anyone else on the mat. So I've never I've never seen someone say

50:34.820 --> 50:39.460
 Okay, I changed my diet and because of that there was a measurable

50:39.460 --> 50:47.580
 Improvement, you know in sports performance another way to phrase it though is I have noticed with a lot of lead athletes what they eat

50:47.980 --> 50:53.020
 They begin to believe that that either is not a hindrance or it's actually good

50:53.020 --> 50:56.780
 Like Travis Stevenson is an example of somebody who eats shitty

50:57.420 --> 51:03.220
 Because he believes it's like it's like a power because whatever he's traveling across the world

51:03.220 --> 51:05.820
 He can't rely on healthy good food to be there

51:05.820 --> 51:12.500
 So I'm going to eat shitty so that that's the like my body knows how to perform under whatever skittles or whatever

51:12.500 --> 51:14.820
 Everywhere's got McDonald's everywhere's got McDonald's

51:14.820 --> 51:20.820
 So that makes like and they've convinced themselves and you talk about Russian athletes. A lot of them have very

51:21.780 --> 51:23.780
 Strong beliefs about like this

51:24.660 --> 51:29.980
 Particular food being good for them, but there's no agreement among them. Exactly. No agreement. Yeah

51:29.980 --> 51:32.780
 Yeah, so believe is more important than the actual time. Yeah

51:32.780 --> 51:36.100
 I'm sorry if I can after

51:36.900 --> 51:40.580
 You know after a night out when you're hanging over I

51:41.540 --> 51:45.540
 Think the best thing and and I'm saying this and all certain sincerity

51:45.540 --> 51:50.920
 I think the best thing to eat to me was like like a cheese cheeseburgers with

51:51.300 --> 51:57.800
 We call that a puts in back home because it's very fat. It's greasy. So it up so the next day

51:57.800 --> 52:02.320
 When you wake up, I think you feel better because it absorbed the outcome. There you go. I'm

52:05.120 --> 52:10.560
 My mom told me the same story once and then I try it was like I was hung over for some party and

52:10.880 --> 52:14.760
 I woke up. I was like probably I don't know 19 or 20 I woke up and

52:15.600 --> 52:20.720
 My mom's like, yeah, just have it have a cheeseburger go go eat something greasy and I did and I was like

52:20.720 --> 52:25.280
 Oh, I feel kind of better now. I do not know that science the exact science behind it

52:25.280 --> 52:31.000
 but I I always notice and I don't know if it's placebo, but I always notice that if I

52:32.280 --> 52:35.100
 I'm if I party hard and I've been drinking a lot

52:35.800 --> 52:38.560
 If I don't eat before I go into bed if I don't eat

52:38.720 --> 52:44.200
 Shitty food the next day will wake up and feel worse than if I eat shitty food. I feel better

52:44.200 --> 52:47.840
 I know it sounds crazy. I don't know why but it works for me

52:47.840 --> 52:53.840
 Yeah, but it's also hard to do science on extreme performers so the discussions we're having is amongst the very

52:53.840 --> 52:59.440
 You know that this might not apply to a general like recreational athlete, but for the elite

52:59.440 --> 53:04.040
 I've just seen champions in every kind of combat sport and I've never seen a

53:04.040 --> 53:11.640
 Correlation between dietary habit and performance and people under the age of 30. I do believe that diet is important for longevity. However, and

53:12.800 --> 53:16.080
 For that alone it may well be worth investing time in it

53:16.080 --> 53:21.440
 But with regards sports performance at least in jiu jitsu, I've never seen any significant difference

53:21.440 --> 53:25.040
 Well, we had a little bit of a difference of opinion on this

53:25.040 --> 53:29.840
 I think what about strength training and muscle building or at least we had a discussion about this

53:29.840 --> 53:31.840
 So what do you believe is the value of?

53:33.760 --> 53:37.840
 Of you know training outside of the sport so fitness

53:38.560 --> 53:42.080
 Lifting heavy lifting explosive all kinds of lifting

53:42.080 --> 53:46.400
 Personally for me, I believe and I've learned that from from John

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
 I used to do like

53:50.560 --> 53:56.160
 To train like a bodybuilder before because I thought in my early days of competition

53:56.160 --> 54:02.480
 That was the most efficient way to do things to because it was like I was watching Jean Claude Van Damme

54:03.040 --> 54:07.200
 Arnold Schwarzenegger, we thought back back in the day. That was the thing

54:07.200 --> 54:11.280
 That that's how we should do it, you know for to get ready for a fight

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
 But I realized later on

54:15.920 --> 54:23.680
 That it's all about efficiency and some guys they don't lift at all and they're doing pretty well, so I

54:24.480 --> 54:27.460
 Do cross training mostly for longevity

54:28.240 --> 54:30.240
 It's mostly for a therapeutic

54:30.800 --> 54:33.520
 Like a therapy. It's more therapeutic than

54:33.520 --> 54:39.920
 For performance is to keep my body healthy to do a certain movement that are different than what I do every day in the gym

54:40.080 --> 54:42.560
 in combat sport to keep me

54:44.560 --> 54:50.640
 Healthy and and athletic so all the interesting movement stuff that you've done outside the sport that was for

54:51.440 --> 54:54.240
 Therapeutic mostly therapeutic. I think it does it could

54:55.120 --> 54:59.840
 Transcend to performance, but it's mostly therapeutic. I do not believe that

54:59.840 --> 55:06.720
 Squatting five plates or bench bench pressing three plate will make me a better fighter

55:06.720 --> 55:12.880
 I do not I believe actually it could hurt me more. It could damage me more than than benefit me

55:13.680 --> 55:14.880
 so

55:14.880 --> 55:17.520
 Gordon as somebody who on instagram posts

55:18.080 --> 55:21.040
 A lot of pictures of you being shredded and huge

55:21.680 --> 55:25.600
 What's the value of of strength? So I do like a combination

55:25.600 --> 55:32.080
 John got us big into like gymnastics type movements like toes to bar and muscle ups and things like that when we were young

55:33.120 --> 55:38.240
 Like toes to bar because that's like the exact motion you have to do when you're retaining guard it needs to chest

55:38.880 --> 55:40.880
 So I do a lot of that stuff

55:41.120 --> 55:43.120
 In combination with I do a lot of

55:43.680 --> 55:46.080
 Opposite of george. I do a lot of bodybuilding workouts

55:46.880 --> 55:50.480
 Where I do like a basic split like a chest to chest

55:50.480 --> 55:57.120
 Triceps back and biceps day. Um, and my idea is that

55:59.600 --> 56:06.160
 Weight lifting should always be a supplement to jiu jitsu. So you shouldn't be missing a jiu jitsu session to lift weights

56:06.960 --> 56:12.400
 So I don't do I do probably I train jiu jitsu every day and I lift three to four times a week

56:12.400 --> 56:17.200
 Um, I feel like lifting seven days a week for me is is too much and the lifting takes a lot of energy

56:17.200 --> 56:21.520
 When you do like hard lifts like that, um, but my idea is if you want to get good at jiu jitsu

56:21.600 --> 56:28.320
 Do jiu jitsu and if you want to be bigger and stronger lift weights and uh, and eat food and um,

56:29.040 --> 56:34.800
 I I generally don't go super heavy when I lift because you start putting crazy weights then start tearing muscles and stuff

56:35.040 --> 56:39.440
 Um, so I usually do moderate weights with a with a very high rep rep range like four sets of 20 with

56:39.680 --> 56:42.800
 a drop set at the end to fatigue the muscles break the fibers and

56:43.520 --> 56:44.720
 grow

56:44.720 --> 56:50.720
 Okay, so four sets of 20 that's interesting. So that that's more for endurance and raw strength

56:50.800 --> 56:52.800
 yeah, and also I think

56:52.800 --> 56:55.440
 close to the competition i'll pick the intensity up and

56:56.080 --> 57:01.600
 While there's no real way to get significant gains in vo2 max. I think that lifting

57:02.160 --> 57:04.480
 And just getting used to mentally redlining

57:05.040 --> 57:10.480
 Um gets me kind of in competition shape because a lot of times in jiu jitsu the guys i'm training with

57:11.040 --> 57:13.040
 They're not on a technical level

57:13.040 --> 57:14.720
 where they can

57:14.720 --> 57:16.800
 Physically exhaust me to the point where I feel like i'm going to die

57:17.360 --> 57:20.960
 But uh, I get most of that like when i'm wrestling because i'm not as efficient in wrestling

57:20.960 --> 57:22.560
 So I get a lot more tired

57:22.560 --> 57:26.160
 Um and lifting when you do like if you do like four sets of 20

57:26.480 --> 57:30.160
 Leg press to squat and you go back and forth like you're like about to die at the end

57:30.400 --> 57:36.800
 And I think I feel like gets me in the mental habit of redlining before competition. But does muscle help you?

57:37.440 --> 57:39.440
 It's like the actual mass of muscle

57:39.440 --> 57:44.640
 Like the actual mass of muscle like this. So I think being stronger will always help in a combo will always help. Yeah

57:44.640 --> 57:49.360
 To some degree. It's not going to be to a degree where

57:50.400 --> 57:52.400
 It overrides efficiency, but I think that

57:53.120 --> 57:59.200
 It can't help being strong or can't hurt being stronger. There's a bunch of people who believe depending on the sport that

58:01.360 --> 58:03.360
 The strength can quickly become a

58:04.080 --> 58:06.660
 That have detrimental effects to efficiency

58:06.660 --> 58:13.060
 Yeah, like I agree that certain kind of I mean if strength is purely is like very cleanly

58:13.540 --> 58:18.260
 Purely applied to the exact movements of the sport. So in judo the explosiveness you need

58:18.740 --> 58:23.540
 Is very difficult to replicate in any kind of way except by doing judo. Yeah, I mean

58:24.180 --> 58:25.620
 for us, uh

58:25.620 --> 58:30.260
 You always have to understand there's only so much technique that can overcome a certain amount of strength

58:30.260 --> 58:33.540
 Like if we all try to fight a silverback gorilla, it's gonna kill us

58:33.540 --> 58:37.380
 Um, but that that being said, um, I do think that

58:37.940 --> 58:45.060
 Like for example heavyweights are usually the least technical because they rely on their size and strength to beat smaller people

58:45.380 --> 58:50.420
 Um, but I think that if you stay with this with the discipline of doing everything very precise

58:50.580 --> 58:56.660
 And I train with a lot smaller people most of the time so I get out of the habit of using uh using my strength

58:56.900 --> 59:02.340
 Um, I think if you're very precise with the way that you train I think that the the extra size and strength can help you

59:02.340 --> 59:05.300
 A quick question. How would you fight a silverback gorilla?

59:07.700 --> 59:13.380
 I mean, is there which animal do you think you can actually defeat that would be impressive that most people would say you can't

59:14.100 --> 59:16.100
 you know, I actually

59:16.100 --> 59:17.940
 I don't have an uh an answer to this

59:17.940 --> 59:23.380
 I thought you were gonna say I want I want I want to say that me and john had like a four hour discussion on

59:23.380 --> 59:26.820
 This one time i'm like, what would win bear or gorilla?

59:26.820 --> 59:33.060
 Uh, and he went into like this whole dissertation about how like jaguars spin underneath and like berimbolo silverbacks and kill them and like rip

59:33.060 --> 59:39.060
 Their rip their artery and their legs out. It was amazing. I guess. Okay, so before we talk about strength john, let me ask you what

59:40.020 --> 59:43.620
 Do you think people would be surprised by if two animals faced?

59:44.180 --> 59:46.660
 One of them would win and people wouldn't predict that

59:47.220 --> 59:53.620
 So they would be surprised by the effectiveness of certain animal at fighting in the whether it's in the forest in the jungle

59:53.620 --> 59:59.140
 So let's slow down here. Okay, so there's two animals of different species fighting

59:59.940 --> 1:00:01.940
 And and most people would pick

1:00:03.060 --> 1:00:08.820
 So for example, the lion gets a lot of credit for some reason i'm not exactly sure why the king of the jungle

1:00:09.540 --> 1:00:10.820
 well, I

1:00:10.820 --> 1:00:12.820
 You know a lot of people told me that the lion

1:00:13.380 --> 1:00:15.380
 for example, the tiger can

1:00:15.380 --> 1:00:18.260
 Be a lion. Yeah, this is one of those age old debates

1:00:18.260 --> 1:00:23.860
 It's okay. Yeah. Well in grappling in fighting it feels like some animals use

1:00:24.500 --> 1:00:25.540
 teeth

1:00:25.540 --> 1:00:31.780
 And some use other parts of their body also like bear actually, I don't even know how they

1:00:33.300 --> 1:00:35.300
 They have extraordinarily powerful

1:00:35.940 --> 1:00:42.340
 And long claws and in addition, they're powerful biters as well. So I wonder and the same with the silverback

1:00:43.060 --> 1:00:45.700
 I don't know how much they're I love that we're having this discussion

1:00:45.700 --> 1:00:50.500
 I think we need joe rogan for this discussion. I think so. Yeah, I think so. Um, so

1:00:50.980 --> 1:00:51.940
 uh

1:00:51.940 --> 1:00:59.060
 Your your question has gone in about five different. So it started with strength. Uh, and let's go back there, which is

1:01:00.100 --> 1:01:04.100
 Do you think for for an athlete in jiu jitsu? Let's let's stick to grappling

1:01:05.060 --> 1:01:10.500
 All right. Do you think strength strength is helpful or detrimental? Uh, i've always believed that

1:01:11.220 --> 1:01:13.220
 two things will

1:01:13.220 --> 1:01:15.220
 Uh create whatever

1:01:15.860 --> 1:01:21.240
 Whatever effectiveness you have in grappling those are your skill set and your attributes

1:01:22.020 --> 1:01:24.900
 And the best athletes are those who excel in both

1:01:25.620 --> 1:01:26.820
 um

1:01:26.820 --> 1:01:29.620
 Don't kid yourself if someone gets twice as strong

1:01:30.980 --> 1:01:35.540
 By some kind of magic potion they're going to be a more effective grappler if someone gets

1:01:36.100 --> 1:01:40.660
 Twice the level of endurance that they had previously they will be a more effective grappler

1:01:40.660 --> 1:01:46.660
 These physical attributes have a very important outcome on the uh, sorry

1:01:46.660 --> 1:01:49.220
 A very important effect upon the outcome of matches

1:01:49.780 --> 1:01:54.100
 Um, it's always a good thing to be stronger. It's always a good thing to have better endurance

1:01:54.100 --> 1:01:59.380
 It's always a good thing to have better balance or whatever other attribute you throw out there. Um

1:02:00.100 --> 1:02:06.340
 Gordon's point was okay. Everyone agrees on that but there's a problem in order to build these things

1:02:06.340 --> 1:02:13.480
 You have to carve into other elements of your training regimen and then it becomes well, which becomes more important

1:02:14.340 --> 1:02:16.900
 increases in strength or increases in skill

1:02:18.980 --> 1:02:20.980
 There comes a point where

1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:24.820
 Investing in strength training starts to get diminishing returns

1:02:25.460 --> 1:02:28.260
 I can't tell the difference between someone who bench presses

1:02:28.820 --> 1:02:34.020
 300 pounds on the mat versus someone who bench presses 400 pounds, but that's a big difference

1:02:34.020 --> 1:02:39.460
 That's a hundred pound difference and for an athlete to go from bench pressing 300 pounds to 400 pounds

1:02:39.700 --> 1:02:43.940
 That would require a great deal of uh of training effort and focus

1:02:45.060 --> 1:02:48.180
 But if I can't tell the difference when I grapple and then why bother?

1:02:48.580 --> 1:02:50.660
 Okay, once you get to a certain strength level

1:02:51.220 --> 1:02:56.260
 It doesn't really help that much to go from a 400 pound bench press to a 450 pound bench press

1:02:56.580 --> 1:03:01.000
 If that's the stage you you're really getting a diminishing in returns on your training investment

1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:04.040
 um now skills on the other hand

1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:12.200
 Experience far far less in terms of diminishing returns every new skill you develop

1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000
 can translate

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:20.200
 Very very well into big increases in performance. Look at the example of gary tonin that we talked about earlier

1:03:20.820 --> 1:03:22.820
 investments in guillotine

1:03:23.080 --> 1:03:29.740
 Made a significant improvement in his uh effectiveness in matches and led directly to some of his most important victories

1:03:29.740 --> 1:03:31.740
 um

1:03:31.820 --> 1:03:34.540
 But if he had invested the same amount of training time in

1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:39.580
 Developing a bench press that was 25 pounds more than previously that would have had no outcome no

1:03:40.220 --> 1:03:42.220
 Influence on the outcome of those matches

1:03:42.620 --> 1:03:46.460
 So the question always becomes yep. Everyone acknowledges that these physical

1:03:47.100 --> 1:03:47.980
 uh

1:03:47.980 --> 1:03:56.460
 Attributes are important and everyone understands that becoming stronger or fitter is a desirable thing and every athlete should work on them

1:03:56.460 --> 1:03:59.660
 The interesting question becomes okay at what point?

1:04:00.220 --> 1:04:04.400
 Do you start to say i'm not going to be helped by further increases?

1:04:05.740 --> 1:04:09.180
 in in strength training or endurance training, um

1:04:09.660 --> 1:04:15.100
 And my point with my athletes is in the overwhelming majority of cases

1:04:16.060 --> 1:04:21.500
 If there's any kind of doubt invest more heavily in skill training than attribute training

1:04:21.820 --> 1:04:24.460
 Especially once you get to a certain level on the attributes

1:04:24.460 --> 1:04:29.100
 Well, the interesting thing that I think you should account for with strength training

1:04:29.740 --> 1:04:31.660
 is um

1:04:31.660 --> 1:04:33.660
 There's instagram

1:04:33.740 --> 1:04:39.020
 There's the world. It's uh, it seems to be more fun to build muscle mass

1:04:39.660 --> 1:04:43.500
 Um, it's like an addiction that people have there's also economic elements too

1:04:43.660 --> 1:04:49.740
 Like most people I I hate to say this but it's true. Most people are more concerned with image

1:04:50.380 --> 1:04:52.780
 than function and uh

1:04:52.780 --> 1:04:54.940
 Uh, it's hard to sell

1:04:56.540 --> 1:05:01.580
 A fighter or a jiu jitsu athlete who doesn't look like one looks like fedor

1:05:01.900 --> 1:05:03.900
 Yeah, it's a tough sell now

1:05:04.140 --> 1:05:09.500
 You can do it in fighting and jiu jitsu because ultimately it's about whose hand is raised at the end of the match

1:05:09.740 --> 1:05:11.420
 And you could even use it as a selling point

1:05:11.420 --> 1:05:15.660
 You can be a guy that doesn't look like he should be winning but he is winning that is a selling point

1:05:15.980 --> 1:05:18.380
 but if you give most people a choice between

1:05:18.380 --> 1:05:25.180
 Looking like arnold schwarzenegger and winning matches versus looking like fedor and when he matches most people will select

1:05:25.340 --> 1:05:27.340
 I wish I'd rather look like arnold schwarzenegger

1:05:27.980 --> 1:05:35.120
 And so most athletes feel almost like an economic compulsion to be in good shape and in order to advance their marketability

1:05:36.460 --> 1:05:41.260
 Yeah, nike's not going to sponsor fedor or tank abbott. Yeah tank abbott

1:05:41.820 --> 1:05:42.860
 No

1:05:42.860 --> 1:05:44.700
 Fedor, maybe

1:05:44.700 --> 1:05:48.380
 Yeah, yeah, we need at the very top. There's there's something about uh aesthetic

1:05:49.660 --> 1:05:55.580
 Like image of strength and power. It's also and also a personal thing if you look at yourself in the mirror

1:05:56.060 --> 1:06:00.300
 Do you like what what you see? You know what I mean? Yeah, you find yourself attractive

1:06:00.380 --> 1:06:02.620
 You know, what what can you do to make you look better?

1:06:02.700 --> 1:06:07.340
 And I think to me to me it was something that one of the reason I work out it's also for for that

1:06:07.820 --> 1:06:11.180
 Well, i'm sure if fedor looks in the mirror. He says I look damn good today

1:06:11.180 --> 1:06:17.660
 Yeah, you could be too. It's also a genetic factor some people, you know, it's harder for them. I mean, yeah

1:06:18.380 --> 1:06:23.500
 All right. So the question on training you guys john gordon train

1:06:24.620 --> 1:06:26.620
 Often three times a day every day

1:06:27.820 --> 1:06:31.340
 um, georgia had a different like, um

1:06:32.540 --> 1:06:35.340
 a different approach to training so like what is uh

1:06:35.740 --> 1:06:40.140
 For for no, I don't mean that in a kind of the opposite or something. It's just not every single day

1:06:40.140 --> 1:06:41.340
 so

1:06:41.340 --> 1:06:43.340
 and obviously you are

1:06:44.060 --> 1:06:46.060
 legitimately at the very top

1:06:46.540 --> 1:06:51.500
 Uh in terms of performance accomplishment in the field. So what have you learned about?

1:06:53.020 --> 1:06:58.940
 What it takes to train to become not just the lead but the best well, I I um

1:07:00.060 --> 1:07:06.540
 A lot of people when you say train they they see training hard. I believe you need to be very constant

1:07:06.540 --> 1:07:12.620
 Uh, and uh, very disciplined you need to train but you don't need to train hard every day

1:07:12.940 --> 1:07:14.940
 That's what john, uh taught me

1:07:15.500 --> 1:07:16.460
 um

1:07:16.460 --> 1:07:22.380
 For me is the nervous system. Sometimes I feel if I load it up too much it comes to a point that you're

1:07:23.100 --> 1:07:27.260
 It's too much. There is no no more information that I can absorb

1:07:27.820 --> 1:07:29.340
 so

1:07:29.340 --> 1:07:37.340
 Uh, and I do believe that it's something that you can train to your the capacity your capacity of being able to learn of

1:07:37.640 --> 1:07:39.640
 absorbing certain thing

1:07:39.660 --> 1:07:43.900
 and uh, I did a lot of volume of training but when I when I

1:07:44.460 --> 1:07:48.220
 Was getting ready for a fight, especially during sparring day

1:07:48.780 --> 1:07:53.180
 I like to do it quick because my when I fight it's five round of five minutes

1:07:53.820 --> 1:07:55.820
 I don't like to to spend

1:07:56.060 --> 1:07:58.060
 um

1:07:58.060 --> 1:08:01.820
 uh an hour or two hours in a gym because

1:08:02.780 --> 1:08:05.020
 I need to know how hard I can be

1:08:05.660 --> 1:08:11.580
 Going for 25 minutes, you know when I not for two hours for 25 minutes and at my last fight

1:08:12.700 --> 1:08:14.700
 john and I we we we

1:08:15.820 --> 1:08:17.900
 We were thinking of how could we

1:08:19.100 --> 1:08:20.460
 make me more

1:08:20.460 --> 1:08:21.580
 uh

1:08:21.580 --> 1:08:24.300
 Of a better finisher, you know more opportunists

1:08:24.300 --> 1:08:29.900
 And then john I remember we we when we were training with gordon jake shill came gary tonin

1:08:30.940 --> 1:08:35.500
 my round of grappling were different than if I would be training for uh

1:08:36.220 --> 1:08:41.900
 Abu dhabi, you know for for abi or like some like in grappling the round or longer but

1:08:42.940 --> 1:08:44.940
 in a mixed martial art fight

1:08:45.500 --> 1:08:47.580
 it's very rare that you're gonna spend

1:08:48.140 --> 1:08:50.140
 more than

1:08:50.140 --> 1:08:55.820
 Four minutes or four minutes and a half on the ground. It's it's very unlikely. I mean it could it can happen but

1:08:56.380 --> 1:08:57.180
 so

1:08:57.180 --> 1:08:57.900
 I

1:08:57.900 --> 1:09:03.020
 Do you remember we did the round three minutes? We did all the round I was doing were three minute round

1:09:03.340 --> 1:09:05.340
 So it gives a different

1:09:05.420 --> 1:09:09.840
 Uh rhythm to the training it forced me to be more opportunist

1:09:10.460 --> 1:09:14.940
 To be more of a finisher because I had only three minutes to to do what I needed to do

1:09:14.940 --> 1:09:20.060
 So if I if I see something I need to to go for the kill right away. I cannot be too over patient

1:09:20.140 --> 1:09:21.580
 You know what? I mean?

1:09:21.580 --> 1:09:26.860
 And it it served me well in my last fight and I think it that's a good blueprint to follow

1:09:27.900 --> 1:09:30.860
 um when you're a mixed martial art fighter, I if I would if

1:09:32.220 --> 1:09:34.220
 the result was great and I think

1:09:36.220 --> 1:09:40.460
 Maybe I should have done that before it was a great great idea that we had not to do

1:09:41.020 --> 1:09:43.100
 Be very careful on doing too much volume

1:09:43.100 --> 1:09:48.460
 Yes, try to get out and then try to focus on finishing and getting getting out as quickly as possible

1:09:49.020 --> 1:09:52.780
 To build up your foundation. I believe you need a lot of volume

1:09:52.860 --> 1:09:58.000
 But when you get ready for a competition, you need some to be something that replicate

1:09:58.700 --> 1:10:02.620
 What you're gonna be facing? What do you what are we talking about? What do you think?

1:10:03.180 --> 1:10:05.580
 Like is there rest days five days a week?

1:10:06.140 --> 1:10:09.660
 Twice a day once a day. Is there any one formula like that? I don't know

1:10:09.660 --> 1:10:13.740
 This this I don't I do not believe in overtraining. I believe in under arrest

1:10:14.940 --> 1:10:16.940
 I believe

1:10:17.660 --> 1:10:19.820
 You can be under arrest and

1:10:20.540 --> 1:10:21.900
 people

1:10:21.900 --> 1:10:27.500
 Always link that immediately to the volume of their how much volume they they train

1:10:27.980 --> 1:10:33.740
 Which it could be something else. How are you feeling? I'm emotionally. Are you you having uh,

1:10:33.740 --> 1:10:41.420
 Problems, uh personal problem. Do you have a have a hard time sleeping because you have a like someone died or I don't know

1:10:41.420 --> 1:10:45.580
 Like you you hold money you're broke or what like, you know what I mean could be anything

1:10:46.860 --> 1:10:50.460
 There is something that can affect you psychologically or emotionally

1:10:51.420 --> 1:10:57.420
 That made it in a way that you cannot sleep. Well because your your stress your cortisol level is high

1:10:57.420 --> 1:11:04.460
 You're you know what? I mean all these factors need to be take taken in consideration. It's not only about the volume of training people

1:11:05.100 --> 1:11:06.300
 always think

1:11:06.300 --> 1:11:10.460
 The volume of the training is the only thing that can affect

1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:16.460
 Recuperation which is not you know. Yeah, you have to minimize the amount of stress from all kinds of factors

1:11:16.460 --> 1:11:19.580
 It's a very stressful job to be a professional

1:11:19.580 --> 1:11:26.300
 combat athlete whether you're a grappler a boxer a kickboxer a fighter and you need to be taking

1:11:27.100 --> 1:11:28.300
 as a

1:11:28.300 --> 1:11:31.980
 Into account is it more or less stressful than marriage? Just kidding

1:11:33.180 --> 1:11:35.180
 Uh next question, uh

1:11:37.260 --> 1:11:43.020
 So, I don't know how to ask this question given what george just said but you're training three times a day

1:11:45.020 --> 1:11:47.020
 And finishing

1:11:47.020 --> 1:11:52.700
 And what what have you learned about what what brings out the best in you as as the elite level grappler?

1:11:53.420 --> 1:11:56.540
 Um, so over the recent years have actually changed it up a little bit

1:11:57.100 --> 1:11:59.100
 um when I was

1:11:59.180 --> 1:12:01.820
 Coming up through from white to black belt

1:12:02.460 --> 1:12:08.300
 Uh, I felt that the volume was the most important so it would be anywhere from like three

1:12:09.100 --> 1:12:11.100
 To seven sessions a day

1:12:11.100 --> 1:12:17.740
 Um going from school to school from new york to new jersey. Um, and I think that the volume was very important to build the skills

1:12:19.180 --> 1:12:21.180
 um where I just

1:12:21.180 --> 1:12:25.980
 Didn't know how to move my body at purple belt the way that I should. Um, so I think that building the skills

1:12:26.540 --> 1:12:30.620
 Is uh is super important. I think that early on volume is very important

1:12:31.180 --> 1:12:35.980
 Uh now that I already have the skills built. I think that acquiring more knowledge is the most important

1:12:36.620 --> 1:12:38.940
 Um, so I think that the volume is the most important

1:12:38.940 --> 1:12:42.460
 Is the most important um, so I find that if I do

1:12:43.180 --> 1:12:46.140
 So many sessions a day like if I do three sessions a day

1:12:46.540 --> 1:12:53.020
 Um, I feel sometimes by the third session i'm just like so mentally like there's just there's so much information

1:12:53.020 --> 1:12:57.500
 That's went through my head the first two sessions that I feel like i'm not even there mentally on the third session

1:12:57.900 --> 1:13:01.020
 Um, so I feel like doing less volume now

1:13:01.260 --> 1:13:07.100
 But having more mental clarity per session is more important because I already have the foundational skills acquired

1:13:07.100 --> 1:13:09.100
 So a lot of your training is almost like

1:13:09.740 --> 1:13:13.980
 Just thinking like learning a lot of it. Yeah, so i'll do like

1:13:14.220 --> 1:13:18.140
 I mean our schedule has been messed up since the pandemic because henzos got shut down

1:13:18.460 --> 1:13:23.340
 And they were using a french gym in puerto rico and now we're using a french gym in our and in austin

1:13:23.820 --> 1:13:25.180
 Um, but once we have our own school

1:13:25.180 --> 1:13:28.220
 We'll have a setup schedule where I can pretty much just be there all day long

1:13:28.620 --> 1:13:32.460
 But right now I do like a lifting session in the morning and then i'll come in and help teach

1:13:32.460 --> 1:13:38.300
 At henzos, so i'm there mentally i'm seeing what's going on and i'm playing around with ideas in my head

1:13:38.860 --> 1:13:43.900
 Uh, and then i'm there physically and very sharp mentally for the competition class during the 1 p.m

1:13:44.300 --> 1:13:48.140
 Session and then after that i'll go home i'll rest and get ready for the next day

1:13:51.100 --> 1:13:54.140
 What have you learned on seeing all these different athletes is there a

1:13:54.780 --> 1:14:01.020
 A universal rule that applies or is it um, athlete specific? Yeah, uh, first one thing

1:14:01.020 --> 1:14:08.060
 It needs to be addressed is that george and gordon play very different sports with very different athletic demands

1:14:09.260 --> 1:14:12.860
 Gordon can be in matches that range from anywhere from six

1:14:13.500 --> 1:14:15.980
 minutes to literally hours long

1:14:16.540 --> 1:14:19.740
 um as a result, uh the overall

1:14:20.940 --> 1:14:28.060
 Pacing and intensity of matches is massively different most obviously there is no striking in gordon's sport

1:14:28.060 --> 1:14:35.840
 Um striking by its very nature is a much more explosive physical action than grappling is grappling is primarily an isometric

1:14:36.460 --> 1:14:39.980
 kind of uh sport based around isometric tension and endurance

1:14:40.540 --> 1:14:42.540
 um george's sport is

1:14:43.660 --> 1:14:46.860
 It does feature a significant amount of isometric tension, but

1:14:47.500 --> 1:14:52.940
 The majority of it is based around explosion. So the physical demands of the two sports are radically different

1:14:52.940 --> 1:14:58.380
 different in addition the time of application is is radically different

1:14:58.780 --> 1:15:03.980
 George raised a very interesting point his matches seem long 25 minutes for a championship match

1:15:04.620 --> 1:15:06.620
 Um, but always understand it

1:15:07.900 --> 1:15:09.900
 It makes martial arts fight

1:15:10.060 --> 1:15:11.820
 at championship level

1:15:11.820 --> 1:15:13.820
 if it goes the distance is really

1:15:14.780 --> 1:15:17.740
 five five minute matches each round

1:15:17.740 --> 1:15:24.860
 Is a match in itself and that's exactly how you're scored. You're scored by who wins the most matches over five matches

1:15:25.420 --> 1:15:33.260
 As a result the application of the techniques, especially the grappling techniques has to be done at a certain pace as george pointed out

1:15:33.660 --> 1:15:34.940
 realistically

1:15:34.940 --> 1:15:39.260
 the maximum application time you're going to get in most situations is somewhere between

1:15:40.700 --> 1:15:42.860
 15 seconds and three minutes

1:15:42.860 --> 1:15:48.540
 Even for a specialized grappler like damien meyer. There's still a significant part of each round which is

1:15:48.940 --> 1:15:52.860
 Spent in set up time to actually get the match to the ground

1:15:53.420 --> 1:15:59.740
 Um, it's very likely that at some point your opponent will stand up out of grappling and you'll have to reinitiate the entire process again

1:16:00.140 --> 1:16:06.460
 So that even for specialized grapplers, you might be spending only three minutes out of a five minute round

1:16:06.460 --> 1:16:12.860
 Uh on the ground and as a result, you've got to get your work done in a very short time frame

1:16:13.500 --> 1:16:14.940
 gordon ryan

1:16:14.940 --> 1:16:18.540
 Once it goes to the ground and it can go to the ground because he chooses to sit to the ground

1:16:19.740 --> 1:16:24.140
 Uh may spend the entire match in ground positions. Um

1:16:25.500 --> 1:16:33.020
 As a result the matches have completely different pacing and completely different physical demands and the preparation that the two athletes go through will reflect that

1:16:33.020 --> 1:16:38.380
 If george saint pierre in training for mixed martial arts becomes fatigued to a point

1:16:39.020 --> 1:16:46.220
 Where he's no longer physically effective and able to defend himself the consequences for that in mma training can be very deep and deep

1:16:47.180 --> 1:16:53.500
 Okay, if you make a mistake in mixed martial arts because you're fatigued and tired and you take a full power roundhouse kick to the head

1:16:54.540 --> 1:16:59.500
 That's some deep consequences. A grappler doesn't have to face that you can be completely

1:16:59.500 --> 1:17:03.420
 Exhausted and grappling and just sit in the bottom of the mountain. Just practice just survival skills

1:17:03.580 --> 1:17:07.500
 We just don't get submitted from bottom out and that can still be an effective training session

1:17:08.380 --> 1:17:11.580
 complete and utter physical breakdown and fatigue can be

1:17:12.940 --> 1:17:15.420
 Can end an athlete's career in mixed martial arts

1:17:16.140 --> 1:17:18.140
 the consequences of

1:17:18.460 --> 1:17:20.460
 training through fatigue and mma

1:17:21.580 --> 1:17:23.580
 Potentially very deep and very disturbing

1:17:23.580 --> 1:17:29.500
 Um, the consequences of training through complete physical exhaustion and grappling aren't really that severe

1:17:30.060 --> 1:17:32.060
 Okay, you just tap whenever there's a problem just tap

1:17:32.620 --> 1:17:37.660
 Um, and so they're very very different sports in the way you you prepare for them

1:17:39.260 --> 1:17:41.260
 And a grappling

1:17:41.260 --> 1:17:43.260
 Athlete like gordon ryan, we can take

1:17:44.060 --> 1:17:49.420
 Many more liberties with physical exhaustion and the amount of hours a day you spend training

1:17:49.420 --> 1:17:54.860
 Than you could with a mixed martial arts athlete like that should be a benefit. Uh exhaustion as a

1:17:55.820 --> 1:17:59.980
 As a framework of learning so like from a place of exhaustion

1:18:00.540 --> 1:18:05.820
 Is there any benefit to the you on the you said being at the bottom of mouth sort of understanding?

1:18:06.540 --> 1:18:10.380
 Jiu jitsu or grappling somehow deeper because you're physically absolutely

1:18:10.780 --> 1:18:15.900
 Absolutely, because then the only thing you have left in your favor is the training and the training

1:18:15.900 --> 1:18:22.140
 Absolutely, because then the only thing you have left in your favor is your technique and then you'll see how technical you are

1:18:22.540 --> 1:18:28.300
 In addition you'll get to explore realms inside your mind that we don't spend a lot of time in

1:18:28.860 --> 1:18:32.540
 And you'll learn a lot about yourself and your ability to endure which will

1:18:33.340 --> 1:18:34.780
 have uh

1:18:34.780 --> 1:18:41.100
 Potentially great benefits in similar situations and matches. Yeah, there's uh, I mean for me for a recreational person

1:18:42.220 --> 1:18:43.720
 getting

1:18:43.720 --> 1:18:48.540
 Exhaustion allows you the great benefit to experience what it feels like to really get dominated

1:18:49.340 --> 1:18:52.300
 At an even greater frequency than you otherwise would

1:18:53.500 --> 1:18:57.100
 And there's something there. There's some animalistic thing. That's very unpleasant

1:18:57.740 --> 1:19:00.700
 and then afterwards it takes you to a nice to a place of

1:19:01.580 --> 1:19:03.580
 like, um humility and

1:19:04.540 --> 1:19:07.180
 I don't know you get it forces you to rethink life

1:19:08.060 --> 1:19:09.660
 in positive ways

1:19:09.660 --> 1:19:16.780
 There's something about dominance. It can mean if you get dominated a few times you can uh, rationalize it somehow

1:19:17.260 --> 1:19:17.900
 You say okay

1:19:17.900 --> 1:19:19.340
 Well, I screwed this up

1:19:19.340 --> 1:19:25.100
 But with when you're exhausted and you have to do like 30 minutes or 40 minutes or an hour of just being dominant

1:19:25.100 --> 1:19:27.100
 Over and over and over being submitted

1:19:27.980 --> 1:19:30.860
 It uh, I don't know. It's it's a very good process for

1:19:32.300 --> 1:19:37.820
 For other avenues of life I find it's I can't explain why because i'm i'm

1:19:37.820 --> 1:19:44.060
 uh driving home crying afterwards listening to bruce springsteen, but afterwards

1:19:45.260 --> 1:19:46.940
 yeah, this

1:19:46.940 --> 1:19:53.260
 Afterwards somehow you can think clearer you can see clear about what is the right path through life in all walks of life

1:19:53.580 --> 1:19:57.020
 Like relationships work, but also the grappling

1:19:57.740 --> 1:20:00.300
 Actually, the grappling is the hardest one to see what you have to do

1:20:01.660 --> 1:20:05.820
 It clarifies other avenues the humility. It's the it removes the bullshit

1:20:05.820 --> 1:20:07.820
 It's like we see

1:20:07.820 --> 1:20:13.500
 The world through some kind of fog and it just removes it and now you can see things clearly. I don't know what that is

1:20:14.220 --> 1:20:18.220
 I think I think it's important like you mentioned to push yourself like sometimes

1:20:18.940 --> 1:20:20.140
 to see

1:20:20.140 --> 1:20:25.980
 How far you can go because sometimes you you can go further than where you think and it can boost your confidence

1:20:25.980 --> 1:20:28.540
 You know, you can push yourself through a certain limit

1:20:29.100 --> 1:20:33.660
 And maybe you thought your limit were was before that point and you push through it

1:20:33.660 --> 1:20:35.660
 But like john just mentioned

1:20:36.300 --> 1:20:38.300
 It's a risky thing to do in

1:20:38.920 --> 1:20:42.620
 Striking because if you're exhausted you're gonna get brain damage

1:20:43.180 --> 1:20:48.620
 In grappling it's you know, you tap if something wrong, but you can do it also in strength conditioning

1:20:48.700 --> 1:20:51.500
 I like to run track. I do it all the time and track and feel

1:20:52.220 --> 1:20:54.220
 it it helps me to

1:20:54.300 --> 1:20:58.620
 To to know myself better. I think it's important. It's a it's a good point

1:20:58.620 --> 1:21:02.540
 It's like it's like the scrimmage wrestling rounds we do. It's like, you know, if you stop moving

1:21:03.340 --> 1:21:07.900
 That you're gonna get scored on and you know in your mind like there's no mechanical reason

1:21:08.380 --> 1:21:13.900
 Why I am why I should give up a score here, but you're so exhausted that you're like, oh man, this is terrible

1:21:14.140 --> 1:21:16.140
 If I if I stop moving i'm a pussy

1:21:17.660 --> 1:21:21.660
 If I don't stop move if I don't stop moving i'm gonna be twice as exhausted when we actually do stand up

1:21:21.660 --> 1:21:25.100
 So it's uh, it's an interesting game. You have to play inside your mind. It's it's your

1:21:25.100 --> 1:21:31.260
 That keep you that keep you uh sharp, you know what I mean? Because you just want to lay down and beat it

1:21:31.820 --> 1:21:34.220
 Because you're completely exhausted, you know

1:21:35.180 --> 1:21:40.380
 What do you think uh is the connection john between this ego pride thing?

1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:46.780
 Martial arts and actual violence in our with our ancestors. Do you think

1:21:47.580 --> 1:21:50.300
 You ever plug into that? Do you think that's a good thing?

1:21:50.300 --> 1:21:54.460
 With our ancestors. Do you think you ever plug into that?

1:21:54.700 --> 1:21:59.340
 You think there's echoes of something going on there or like you mentioned you have flaws and demons

1:22:00.140 --> 1:22:04.060
 Is it deep in there somewhere? Do you think we're struggling with those demons?

1:22:04.860 --> 1:22:10.620
 Yeah, uh, you'll need to patch up your question a little bit though. It's going to say we're different donations. Wow, that was

1:22:11.500 --> 1:22:15.900
 Not only might be dominating just I mean dominating interviewing. No, no, no, but i'm not

1:22:15.900 --> 1:22:20.620
 Patched up that question. Uh, it's not brother seeing where they're like, okay now we interview you

1:22:21.420 --> 1:22:23.420
 But you you went down the evolution

1:22:24.700 --> 1:22:31.340
 I mean, do you think do you um, I don't mean just the line between what is what is martial arts and what is violence?

1:22:31.420 --> 1:22:33.660
 I mean there there seems to be a gray area

1:22:34.220 --> 1:22:41.020
 And that connects us to the the evolutionary ancestors. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I I think there's a deep

1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:44.380
 recognition in all of us that

1:22:44.380 --> 1:22:46.380
 um, and this is

1:22:46.860 --> 1:22:52.540
 The evidence for this is is so easy to uh to see in in in daily life. Um

1:22:54.700 --> 1:22:59.580
 If you're walking down the street and suddenly you hear a commotion and two people are fighting

1:23:01.180 --> 1:23:08.140
 You will see literally everyone on that street stop whatever they're doing and watch the fight

1:23:08.140 --> 1:23:13.580
 Humans are fascinated by violence

1:23:14.380 --> 1:23:22.700
 And you've got to ask yourself why and of course, it's a recognition that for a significant part of our evolutionary history

1:23:23.580 --> 1:23:28.300
 Violence was one of the most important elements in human existence

1:23:29.100 --> 1:23:34.060
 As much as we curse it as much as we talk badly of it. Um

1:23:34.060 --> 1:23:43.020
 Um, the juxtaposition between humans social nature and their their need to for each other to get along and to express

1:23:43.500 --> 1:23:45.100
 love amongst the

1:23:45.100 --> 1:23:47.100
 the various members of a given community

1:23:47.820 --> 1:23:49.660
 there are

1:23:49.660 --> 1:23:52.940
 Disputes between humans that can't be resolved and ultimately

1:23:53.740 --> 1:23:56.700
 throughout history violence has been the number one method of

1:23:57.900 --> 1:23:59.660
 conflict resolution

1:23:59.660 --> 1:24:04.860
 um for better or for worse and there's a recognition in all of us that

1:24:06.060 --> 1:24:09.180
 This is where we come from and there's a reason why

1:24:10.300 --> 1:24:12.300
 combat sports have this

1:24:12.620 --> 1:24:13.740
 thing where

1:24:13.740 --> 1:24:18.860
 People will watch them and they might even be repulsed by them, but they find it difficult to take their eyes from it

1:24:19.500 --> 1:24:21.500
 and um, uh

1:24:22.940 --> 1:24:26.860
 I do believe that most combat athletes carry that sense

1:24:27.660 --> 1:24:29.180
 of their

1:24:29.180 --> 1:24:32.860
 even if it's on a subconscious level this kind of belief that

1:24:34.140 --> 1:24:41.340
 This is who we are. Um george used the word pride and I believe that's a big part of it. I believe that um,

1:24:43.500 --> 1:24:44.860
 Most

1:24:44.860 --> 1:24:48.860
 Humans have this sense of self worth and pride which they're willing to fight for

1:24:49.420 --> 1:24:53.260
 And uh, if it gets crossed by someone else they're willing to stand that

1:24:54.060 --> 1:24:58.460
 Some people will stand more early and some people will be pushed further back, but everyone's got that

1:24:58.460 --> 1:25:01.260
 That line beyond which they won't be pushed

1:25:01.820 --> 1:25:06.540
 And there's some kind of deep recognition in all of us that we have that somewhere within us

1:25:07.020 --> 1:25:09.580
 No matter how hard we try to bury it or what have you

1:25:10.140 --> 1:25:12.640
 And that's why I believe there will always be this eternal

1:25:13.260 --> 1:25:15.260
 interest in combat sports

1:25:17.340 --> 1:25:18.460
 Now

1:25:18.460 --> 1:25:24.620
 I don't believe that most people today have any kind of respect for unrestricted violence or

1:25:25.240 --> 1:25:27.240
 non consensual violence

1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:31.880
 um, I think most people most good people are repulsed by that now i'm

1:25:32.520 --> 1:25:34.520
 I'm sure that as humanity

1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:37.900
 Improves out into the future that will become more and more widespread

1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:40.120
 but

1:25:40.120 --> 1:25:43.480
 That's not to say we we can't exercise these these

1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:49.560
 old evolutionary demons inside of us and um, uh and

1:25:50.360 --> 1:25:55.480
 sometimes there are just disputes between different people different cultures different nations where

1:25:55.480 --> 1:25:57.480
 ultimately it's going to come to

1:25:58.520 --> 1:26:03.000
 Into into a shoving match and that will degenerate further into violence. There's always going to be

1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:05.640
 a need for humans to be able to

1:26:06.600 --> 1:26:07.720
 to

1:26:07.720 --> 1:26:09.720
 express themselves

1:26:09.800 --> 1:26:14.620
 Through violent methods and to use physical force to get to their their goals and objectives

1:26:15.640 --> 1:26:16.760
 um

1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:18.600
 our

1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:22.040
 Our need as humans is always to find a balance between

1:26:22.040 --> 1:26:25.500
 The two forces of conflict and cooperation

1:26:26.040 --> 1:26:31.480
 We need cooperation because humans isolated from each other are more or less helpless and useless

1:26:32.360 --> 1:26:34.360
 uh in order to

1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:37.400
 advance human communities need to build and grow

1:26:37.880 --> 1:26:40.120
 And so that sense of cooperation

1:26:40.680 --> 1:26:42.680
 occurs in most of our daily lives

1:26:43.160 --> 1:26:49.800
 But there will also be irresolvable conflicts where physical force has to be used to to form a resolution

1:26:49.800 --> 1:26:52.940
 more resolution and so most human beings find themselves

1:26:53.640 --> 1:26:56.380
 swinging like a pendulum between conflict and cooperation

1:26:57.320 --> 1:27:01.240
 and um, uh, and that is something which

1:27:02.760 --> 1:27:09.880
 Really gives birth I think to combat sports because sorry. I really have to ask you about this then. There's a guy even harvard

1:27:10.440 --> 1:27:12.440
 uh named richard rangham

1:27:12.680 --> 1:27:16.360
 And there's a lot of people that believe this he wrote this book that um

1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:21.960
 Um, basically, there's a lot of people studying is what happened? How did we get from apes to humans?

1:27:21.960 --> 1:27:27.240
 Like what was the magic thing? Right a lot of people attributed to fire and ability to cook meat

1:27:28.040 --> 1:27:29.960
 There's a lot of different theories

1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:30.920
 so

1:27:30.920 --> 1:27:32.920
 he actually um

1:27:34.680 --> 1:27:36.360
 His theory

1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:39.960
 How do I describe this is basically that that the beta males won?

1:27:41.240 --> 1:27:43.240
 that the the

1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:44.200
 the

1:27:44.200 --> 1:27:51.800
 Apes that were able to cooperate so you though the way you develop cooperation is that there's a big bad leader

1:27:52.920 --> 1:27:55.080
 that uh, the the alpha male

1:27:55.960 --> 1:27:57.640
 that you can only

1:27:57.640 --> 1:28:00.840
 um knock off their throne if you cooperate

1:28:01.320 --> 1:28:07.960
 And so we build big tribes that just excel the cooperation by practicing the overthrowing the leader

1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:13.880
 and so and anytime an alpha male would rise up they would get would we would uh

1:28:13.880 --> 1:28:16.440
 Develop our skill further and further of cooperation

1:28:16.920 --> 1:28:21.160
 And so we're all just beta males, uh, the descendants of beta males

1:28:21.160 --> 1:28:27.480
 that's this uh kind of theory that cooperation is fundamental and it's so distinct to the the rest of the

1:28:28.120 --> 1:28:30.120
 neighboring animal kingdom

1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:35.000
 So fascinating. I wonder what you think about this tension of violence of cooperation

1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:41.480
 And how important is this cooperation to the core of yeah, uh who if you you can look at it in the uh,

1:28:42.120 --> 1:28:44.120
 in a given training room, um

1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:50.920
 Jiu jitsu and mixed martial arts is solo sports a solo athlete steps into the cage or steps onto the mat

1:28:51.480 --> 1:28:57.400
 but all of your preparation is done in a cooperative training environment with many peers and

1:28:58.200 --> 1:29:00.760
 Uh as much as it's an individual sport

1:29:00.760 --> 1:29:04.840
 All of your preparation is done in as part of a group. Um

1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:09.000
 There's a sense in which uh

1:29:09.080 --> 1:29:15.320
 That's an interesting metaphor for humanity itself everything we do in life. We do alone, but we grow up in this

1:29:15.960 --> 1:29:17.960
 Given community and and what have you?

1:29:18.520 --> 1:29:20.520
 um

1:29:21.880 --> 1:29:26.600
 With regards to the the whole alpha male beta male thing, um

1:29:26.600 --> 1:29:31.400
 Humans are it's true. This fellow's correct. We you know, most

1:29:31.960 --> 1:29:40.840
 Primates do have very strongly defined alpha males who rule the roost and determine the entire direction of the um, uh,

1:29:41.400 --> 1:29:43.400
 of of uh

1:29:43.720 --> 1:29:46.140
 The community they they build around themselves

1:29:46.680 --> 1:29:48.440
 um

1:29:48.440 --> 1:29:50.440
 Humans on the other hand

1:29:50.440 --> 1:29:55.480
 Don't have an alpha male in that strict biological sense of someone who's

1:29:55.480 --> 1:30:01.000
 Responsible for the next generation dominates all the female population, etc

1:30:01.400 --> 1:30:09.000
 Physically dominates, but we do on the other hand have our own version of alpha males insofar as we have political and sociological

1:30:09.320 --> 1:30:15.960
 Leaders who have a disproportionate impact on the direction of a of a community. Um

1:30:17.400 --> 1:30:20.280
 uh, so was the cooperation allowed us to

1:30:20.280 --> 1:30:26.920
 To have a greater scale of hierarchy with the alpha male on top or the alpha creature on top. Yeah. Yeah

1:30:27.480 --> 1:30:29.480
 No, that's a fascinating theory

1:30:31.320 --> 1:30:35.080
 In in nature, we're we're very weak as a species

1:30:35.080 --> 1:30:40.600
 So we needed to cooperate cooperate in order to to evolve that I think

1:30:41.400 --> 1:30:45.880
 Made us uh, the the top of the food chain if you look at um,

1:30:45.880 --> 1:30:50.440
 Humanity in in nature, really the two things that seem to

1:30:52.520 --> 1:30:57.080
 More than anything else determine whether or not a given human community will be

1:30:58.100 --> 1:31:01.560
 Successful in a predatory world are numbers and technology

1:31:02.520 --> 1:31:09.640
 Okay, the more your numbers increase and the the higher the technology of the weapons and support systems you have around you the more successful

1:31:09.640 --> 1:31:11.640
 You'll be in a predatory world

1:31:11.640 --> 1:31:17.480
 um, so it's not clear that just killing off the idea of an alpha male was the

1:31:18.280 --> 1:31:22.440
 The the single biggest thing. Um, the rise of technology

1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:25.000
 Uh and the growth of community

1:31:25.080 --> 1:31:28.360
 After the imposition of language, these are other things that would have been

1:31:28.920 --> 1:31:34.680
 Very very important factors and and humanity's rise george. You made an interesting point if you look at humans

1:31:35.400 --> 1:31:37.400
 Just the raw material of humans. We're we're

1:31:37.400 --> 1:31:43.960
 We're fucking pathetic. We did and a predatory animal kingdom. We're just the absolute bottom of the food chain

1:31:44.920 --> 1:31:46.920
 Um, we don't have a single

1:31:47.460 --> 1:31:48.840
 effective

1:31:48.840 --> 1:31:51.960
 Weapon other than better than average endurance. That's about it

1:31:52.600 --> 1:31:53.640
 um

1:31:53.640 --> 1:31:58.680
 But you put us in a community who can talk to each other with language and give us the time

1:31:59.320 --> 1:32:03.160
 To come up with technological advances such as metal

1:32:03.160 --> 1:32:09.560
 um, and suddenly a human will go from no combat effectiveness in the animal kingdom to a

1:32:10.280 --> 1:32:13.800
 A human armed with a simple metal tip spear can kill

1:32:14.520 --> 1:32:16.520
 damn near any animal in the uh,

1:32:16.920 --> 1:32:18.920
 In the animal kingdom and working as a group

1:32:19.480 --> 1:32:26.040
 I'll beat your silver back. You know how i'll fight him in a deep water pool because he cannot swim

1:32:26.120 --> 1:32:28.120
 So I don't have to touch him

1:32:28.200 --> 1:32:29.720
 You'll be in a

1:32:29.720 --> 1:32:35.240
 Because he cannot swim so I don't have to touch him you'll drown and I'll get him into the pool

1:32:35.640 --> 1:32:42.120
 You know why because someone told me because we live in a community someone told me that information. So I know he passed it on to me

1:32:42.680 --> 1:32:44.680
 Yeah, he taught you

1:32:44.760 --> 1:32:49.880
 Well, you have to convince him to you have to somehow convince them to join you in the pool, which is very difficult

1:32:50.760 --> 1:32:53.800
 It's very problem. Very very difficult. Um

1:32:55.480 --> 1:32:56.600
 From a

1:32:56.600 --> 1:33:00.200
 technical perspective john you've looked at

1:33:00.360 --> 1:33:04.920
 Martial arts fighting in general and grappling. What's the difference between fighting and grappling?

1:33:05.480 --> 1:33:07.480
 That's something i'd love to

1:33:07.480 --> 1:33:13.660
 Ask all of you. Maybe john you can start like, um, well, uh when you talk about fighting you mean unrestricted

1:33:14.760 --> 1:33:21.240
 Uh mma top type fighting. Yeah, it's funny. You said unrestricted mma type fight mma type fighting

1:33:21.240 --> 1:33:27.240
 So there's there's this street fighting. Yep. Yeah, there's mma fighting and then there's grappling

1:33:27.560 --> 1:33:31.960
 It's really the sport of grappling. You're saying okay. What's the difference between mma and grappling? Yes. Okay

1:33:32.360 --> 1:33:38.120
 Um, see that would have been a much better question to ask. Um, well the uh, uh the single

1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:42.360
 When you talk about grappling you're talking about jujitsu rules or yeah

1:33:42.440 --> 1:33:48.600
 I mean you could maybe also mention different rule sets that somehow fundamentally challenge change the sport, you know

1:33:48.600 --> 1:33:51.320
 Um in the sport of mixed martial arts

1:33:51.880 --> 1:33:53.160
 uh

1:33:53.160 --> 1:33:55.160
 You've got two

1:33:55.640 --> 1:34:01.160
 Ways to inflict damage on the human body. You've you've got kinetic energy which is done through striking

1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:04.520
 kicking knees elbows fists, um

1:34:05.160 --> 1:34:06.680
 and you've got

1:34:06.680 --> 1:34:10.280
 uh isometric tension used along the lines of

1:34:11.240 --> 1:34:12.840
 lever and fulcrum

1:34:12.840 --> 1:34:15.800
 Which can be used for strangulation and and joint breaking

1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:17.720
 um

1:34:17.720 --> 1:34:22.360
 In grappling you lose one of those you're no longer allowed to hurt your opponent with kinetic energy

1:34:22.360 --> 1:34:25.240
 you can do it accidentally through a throw, but you're not allowed to just

1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:29.800
 You know knock someone out with a throw in most grappling sports it can happen

1:34:29.880 --> 1:34:33.240
 But it's relatively rare and it's it's not encouraged by the rule set

1:34:33.880 --> 1:34:35.880
 so

1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:40.920
 Yeah, you got close, um, uh, so

1:34:40.920 --> 1:34:49.080
 So there's a sense in which in mixed martial arts you got twice as many problems to deal with and um, uh, and they occur

1:34:49.720 --> 1:34:51.240
 in

1:34:51.240 --> 1:34:57.480
 A much shorter time frame the single biggest difference between grappling technique as a weapon

1:34:58.200 --> 1:35:01.160
 In human combat versus striking technique is time

1:35:01.800 --> 1:35:05.080
 Grappling technique takes a huge amount of time to apply

1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:06.440
 Okay

1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:10.680
 The great advantage of grappling technique is certainty of outcome once you get there

1:35:11.720 --> 1:35:15.320
 It takes a huge amount of time to set up a takedown

1:35:16.200 --> 1:35:18.200
 Physically take them down

1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:24.920
 Work their way work your way towards a dominant position culminating in your opponent's back and then apply a strangle hold

1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:28.520
 that's a long chain of events as opposed to

1:35:30.840 --> 1:35:33.000
 A strong punch or kick which can take

1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:37.000
 A quarter of a second an application from start to finish and the match is over

1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:39.240
 um

1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:40.360
 and so

1:35:40.360 --> 1:35:45.080
 there's a sense in which uh grappling is is it's

1:35:46.600 --> 1:35:49.560
 It's fighting for the patient and the calculating

1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:53.240
 Whereas striking is much more for

1:35:54.440 --> 1:35:59.080
 In this short time frame where everything gets done in the in the blink of an eye

1:35:59.080 --> 1:36:05.160
 There's a sense also which grappling is a much more forgiving sport. You can make a terrible mistake

1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:09.240
 End up in a terrible position and still fight your way out and win

1:36:10.920 --> 1:36:15.400
 In mixed martial arts, it's much much less forgiving

1:36:16.200 --> 1:36:19.400
 If you get hit and stunned your chances of recovery

1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:26.440
 Are minimal you're going to get swarmed on and unless it's right at the end of the round you it's very very hard to recover

1:36:26.440 --> 1:36:29.640
 From getting hit and swarmed on. Um

1:36:30.520 --> 1:36:32.520
 uh, so there's a sense in which

1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:35.960
 The biggest difference between them is time of application of technique

1:36:36.440 --> 1:36:41.000
 Uh in mixed martial arts, it's incredibly unforgiving in terms of time

1:36:41.160 --> 1:36:44.060
 Even the smallest error can have the deepest consequences

1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:48.280
 In grappling you can make massive errors and still come back and win

1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:51.560
 um grappling will typically be won

1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:59.400
 In a much higher percentage case by the more skilled and conditioned grappler. Whereas there is

1:37:00.760 --> 1:37:05.240
 much more of what they call a punches chance in mixed martial arts where

1:37:06.600 --> 1:37:09.240
 There's a much higher likelihood of a lesser athlete

1:37:09.780 --> 1:37:15.960
 Defeating a greater athlete in mma than there is in grappling simply because of time of application of the techniques

1:37:16.360 --> 1:37:18.540
 Even the smallest period of inattention

1:37:18.540 --> 1:37:23.740
 In mma and the match is over gordon ryan could fall asleep for 30 seconds

1:37:24.460 --> 1:37:29.420
 Have his opponent mounted on and wake up and finish him five minutes later. It's not going to happen in mma

1:37:30.700 --> 1:37:33.180
 Okay, so the the stakes are much higher

1:37:33.260 --> 1:37:38.140
 You can do a lot of damage in a very small amount of time and just the dynamic temporal dynamics of how things happen

1:37:38.220 --> 1:37:44.060
 Is very different everything you'll see will be a reflection of that then you go further into things like rule sets

1:37:44.060 --> 1:37:49.340
 In the sport of grappling if gordon ryan comes out and sits down in the middle of the mat

1:37:49.820 --> 1:37:53.500
 His opponent must follow him to the ground and engage

1:37:54.700 --> 1:37:56.380
 in mixed martial arts

1:37:56.380 --> 1:37:58.460
 If you come to the center of the cage and sit down

1:37:59.580 --> 1:38:02.460
 The other guy can just walk away from you. They're completely

1:38:03.100 --> 1:38:06.060
 Oriented in different directions grappling is ground centered

1:38:06.460 --> 1:38:11.260
 Mma is typically standing centered at the beginning of every round you have to start standing again

1:38:11.260 --> 1:38:17.500
 If I disengage from a ground grappling situation stand up and walk away from my opponent

1:38:17.500 --> 1:38:19.820
 My opponent must follow me up to the feet

1:38:20.780 --> 1:38:25.740
 In grappling it's the exact opposite. If I sit to the ground my opponent must follow me to the ground

1:38:25.900 --> 1:38:31.580
 It's written into the rule set and so one is inherently ground or oriented and one is inherently standing oriented

1:38:31.980 --> 1:38:35.820
 So it's more it's more difficult to dictate where the fight happens in mixed martial arts

1:38:35.820 --> 1:38:41.900
 Yes, you have to be able to impose where the fight is whereas in grappling you can simply choose it. So

1:38:42.380 --> 1:38:46.940
 George, what is uh your sense of the the difference in terms of how you approached it?

1:38:47.740 --> 1:38:54.940
 Uh between the two sports so you also are a student of wrestling and grappling so in preparing for fights

1:38:56.780 --> 1:39:00.860
 What parts of grappling purely the sport that you have to leave behind

1:39:02.060 --> 1:39:03.740
 well, I I uh

1:39:03.740 --> 1:39:08.780
 I'm, very lucky. I had the opportunity to I train with I consider the best

1:39:09.340 --> 1:39:11.340
 mentor trainer I ever ever had

1:39:12.140 --> 1:39:13.820
 and I have

1:39:13.820 --> 1:39:19.660
 Some of the best grapplers that I can train with they were they were there to help me through my career

1:39:20.460 --> 1:39:21.980
 so

1:39:21.980 --> 1:39:23.980
 uh for my training is

1:39:24.700 --> 1:39:30.460
 Of course because I do not dedicate as much time in one specific area. It's hard to be

1:39:30.460 --> 1:39:35.820
 You know a world class athlete and that in in only one particular area always

1:39:36.380 --> 1:39:37.900
 for me

1:39:37.900 --> 1:39:45.100
 Like the idea to be more well rounded to be very competent in every of those areas striking grappling

1:39:46.140 --> 1:39:51.740
 Take downs and and all those areas then being just very good at one

1:39:52.540 --> 1:39:57.820
 And not as good at as as others, you know, because I like the idea that

1:39:57.820 --> 1:40:01.740
 It gives me more option when I fight someone I can

1:40:02.940 --> 1:40:08.780
 Mold myself to become the perfect nemesis to a that person better if i'm more well rounded

1:40:09.500 --> 1:40:12.140
 If I do not have those well rounded skill

1:40:13.740 --> 1:40:15.740
 I don't have that option, you know

1:40:16.700 --> 1:40:21.020
 You have less tools to work with less technology. What about you gordon? What um,

1:40:21.020 --> 1:40:27.580
 You know, what do you think is very distinct about grappling in the way you approach it versus fighting? I think most of it was covered

1:40:27.580 --> 1:40:32.860
 But I think that the the one one of the big things is the fact that when you're looking at mma

1:40:33.660 --> 1:40:40.060
 You have a pretty general agreed upon and unified rule set where if you look at ufc versus bellator

1:40:40.060 --> 1:40:45.100
 They're they have slight differences in the rules maybe um, but it's pretty much the same thing

1:40:45.100 --> 1:40:51.180
 Whereas in grappling you have ebi rules, then you have adcc rules. You have ibgf rules. You have no time limit rules

1:40:51.900 --> 1:40:53.020
 um, and

1:40:53.020 --> 1:40:59.660
 Each rule set will play to the skills of different athletes. Um, if you have if you do adcc rules

1:41:00.060 --> 1:41:04.220
 Uh, it generally is slightly biased towards wrestlers or if they can stall to the overtime

1:41:05.100 --> 1:41:10.700
 And then hit a takedown in the overtime and not really doing jiu jitsu, but they score a takedown. They're gonna win

1:41:10.940 --> 1:41:12.700
 Whereas if you have like a jiu jitsu

1:41:12.700 --> 1:41:16.140
 Takedown they're gonna win whereas if you have like an ebi for example

1:41:16.540 --> 1:41:22.780
 You have to finish the guy in regulation or you start in a jiu jitsu position with your back taken or in an armbar

1:41:23.100 --> 1:41:25.100
 um, so I think that you have

1:41:25.820 --> 1:41:31.420
 certain rule sets that play in the favor of certain athletes, um and

1:41:32.220 --> 1:41:36.460
 Certain athletes can win in one rule set, but then they just have no chance of winning in the other

1:41:36.940 --> 1:41:38.940
 Like when I fought yuri the first time in ebi

1:41:38.940 --> 1:41:44.620
 I beat him in ebi the chances of me beating him on that night under an adcc rule set were probably pretty low

1:41:45.100 --> 1:41:48.060
 Um when I fought liandra low under an adcc rule set

1:41:48.300 --> 1:41:53.420
 He beat me that day, but the chances of him beating me on the same day in an ebi rules that were like next to zero

1:41:54.700 --> 1:41:56.700
 So I think it's interesting that

1:41:56.940 --> 1:42:02.620
 In mma you have one unified rule set which have small differences, but they're all generally the same

1:42:02.860 --> 1:42:07.580
 um, and in jiu jitsu, you have a wide variety of different rule sets that um have

1:42:07.580 --> 1:42:09.100
 uh

1:42:09.100 --> 1:42:10.620
 biases towards

1:42:10.620 --> 1:42:13.980
 a certain athlete skill sets you mentioned liandra low

1:42:14.700 --> 1:42:17.120
 I gotta ask you again about adcc

1:42:18.540 --> 1:42:21.900
 You have lost very very few times in your career

1:42:22.460 --> 1:42:24.140
 Uh one

1:42:24.140 --> 1:42:30.700
 I mean this is the same is true for george and uh, the only person who has ever submitted you is philippe penya black belt

1:42:30.700 --> 1:42:32.700
 Yeah at black belt

1:42:32.700 --> 1:42:38.540
 Um, he is adcc world champion multiple time abby jjf gi and no gi world champion

1:42:39.580 --> 1:42:42.460
 You may face him adcc or elsewhere in the future

1:42:42.940 --> 1:42:43.820
 um

1:42:43.820 --> 1:42:45.580
 Will you beat him?

1:42:45.580 --> 1:42:49.500
 uh, yes, I mean I have to say yes, right, um, but uh

1:42:50.380 --> 1:42:56.540
 I fought him initially when I first got my black belt, um that I fought him a year later. So 2016 and 2017

1:42:57.340 --> 1:42:59.820
 Um, and despite what people remember about the match

1:42:59.820 --> 1:43:06.380
 And whenever people talk about it's like oh, yeah, the guy who strangled gordon, but no one remembers that the first match was like a 45 minute

1:43:06.380 --> 1:43:07.260
 war

1:43:07.260 --> 1:43:12.540
 Um, and then the second match with the full 20 minutes of adcc and if I didn't get my back taken in like the last

1:43:13.660 --> 1:43:17.900
 Minute and a half two minutes, it would have went into an overtime. Um that could change the outcome of the match

1:43:18.700 --> 1:43:20.300
 um

1:43:20.300 --> 1:43:23.040
 I think that if you look at philippe's performances

1:43:23.740 --> 1:43:28.460
 Especially nogi specifically nogi since then it looks like he's almost gotten worse

1:43:28.460 --> 1:43:30.460
 Whereas since that match

1:43:31.100 --> 1:43:33.100
 uh in 2017

1:43:33.180 --> 1:43:40.780
 Uh, the only match I lost after that was against vinnie, uh, magalesh by by points and uh, i'm on like a 55

1:43:41.100 --> 1:43:43.100
 match win streak

1:43:43.100 --> 1:43:51.020
 um over the course of four years, um winning all the major tournaments nogi and uh philippe since that match I think is like five and two

1:43:51.580 --> 1:43:52.940
 uh, nogi

1:43:52.940 --> 1:43:59.340
 Um, and he's lost his last two match matches one was convincingly where he was dominated by andre and one was by submission

1:43:59.660 --> 1:44:03.740
 Um, so I don't think that he's progressed nearly as fast if anything

1:44:03.740 --> 1:44:08.320
 He looks like he's worse than he was when he beat me in 2017 based on his previous performances

1:44:08.940 --> 1:44:13.660
 Um that being said, I know he's going to come in training very hard for this one and he's he's going to be prepared

1:44:13.660 --> 1:44:15.660
 but I just don't think

1:44:15.980 --> 1:44:16.860
 that

1:44:16.860 --> 1:44:23.660
 In terms of technical ability. He's anywhere near my level and um, he was much bigger than me both times

1:44:23.660 --> 1:44:28.380
 We fought um the first time he was much bigger than me the second time. He was one weight class above me

1:44:28.780 --> 1:44:30.860
 um, so now there's not going to be an advantage in

1:44:32.120 --> 1:44:36.560
 Technicality and it's also not going to be a physicality advantage. So I think he's just going to be beat everywhere

1:44:40.140 --> 1:44:43.900
 This is uh, this is a good example of the scientific response to a um,

1:44:43.900 --> 1:44:48.540
 Um to a comment to a to a question. Yeah, so he's not um,

1:44:51.580 --> 1:44:54.380
 That's a match you're you're not deeply concerned with

1:44:55.100 --> 1:45:00.540
 And in terms of the set of opponents because you you have and you will be facing a lot of really difficult

1:45:01.660 --> 1:45:05.900
 That's actually in my opinion one of the easier matches because of the fact that we're relatively the same size

1:45:06.540 --> 1:45:10.140
 um, if I show up at 230 pounds like a lot of the guys are

1:45:10.140 --> 1:45:16.800
 260 270 plus so that extra weight does make a difference. I think out of that entire bracket. Um,

1:45:17.440 --> 1:45:21.360
 Felipe is probably going to be the one of the easiest matches because of the fact that I can easily take him down

1:45:21.840 --> 1:45:23.840
 And if I take him down i'm going to pass his guard

1:45:24.080 --> 1:45:30.640
 Whereas I feel like the other guys because they're so much bigger and they're very cagey. Um, it may take me a while to actually

1:45:31.200 --> 1:45:33.200
 Take them to the ground. Um

1:45:33.440 --> 1:45:34.400
 And get on top of them

1:45:34.400 --> 1:45:38.720
 And I think it may be they may be longer drawn out matches because of the fact that they're so much bigger and

1:45:38.720 --> 1:45:44.400
 And stally it's hard to take them down, but flea based relatively my size and as wrestling is atrocious

1:45:44.640 --> 1:45:47.280
 So i've already taken them down in the last adcc match

1:45:47.520 --> 1:45:51.040
 So i'm pretty sure I can just easily put them down pass them and then finish them

1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:57.200
 Well, i'm, not sure what response I was expecting but uh, that was that was that was phrased beautifully

1:45:58.080 --> 1:46:00.080
 um

1:46:00.400 --> 1:46:06.400
 We talked about the tiago alves fight that george had and john borrowed up in class yesterday

1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:11.680
 I believe but the point is we're talking about wrestling and I think that that's a fascinating fight

1:46:12.400 --> 1:46:13.920
 that um

1:46:13.920 --> 1:46:16.960
 There's an incredible display of strategy of skill of heart

1:46:17.600 --> 1:46:23.360
 Uh, george, could you maybe talk about that fight john? Maybe two what lessons you gained from that fight?

1:46:24.560 --> 1:46:26.560
 Go ahead. It was you're fighting on mine

1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:34.240
 Well, maybe it also tell what happened in terms of your injury I think third round. Oh, yeah. Um

1:46:34.240 --> 1:46:38.720
 Um, so I was fighting tiago alves and uh in the third round I um

1:46:40.320 --> 1:46:42.320
 Tear my adductor muscle

1:46:42.560 --> 1:46:47.440
 Um, it happened when I was on the bottom and he I think he pushed my knee down tried to pass my guard and I

1:46:47.520 --> 1:46:49.360
 Heard a pop

1:46:49.360 --> 1:46:51.360
 I didn't know what I think you were going for an armbar

1:46:52.080 --> 1:46:56.160
 You were on his back you switched to armbar and he cleared the leg by pushing on your leg

1:46:56.160 --> 1:46:58.880
 And you went in with a preexisting injury and it tore

1:46:58.880 --> 1:47:03.840
 Yes, and and it it it get worse and and I heard a pop

1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:08.400
 I didn't know what it was, but I know it really hurt. So I came back standing up and

1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:10.320
 there's a

1:47:10.320 --> 1:47:15.040
 A famous video one that goes on the internet about when I go back in the corner

1:47:15.440 --> 1:47:21.040
 And I tell my my coach i'm like, I don't know what it is. I think I tore my my my adductor muscle and

1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:24.800
 Greg jackson is like, I don't care hit him with your groin

1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:30.080
 I was very worried because I I wasn't pain, but I didn't know I didn't know what what I had

1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:35.200
 So I didn't know the gravity of it and it it it plays on your mind

1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:39.600
 So but I had to buy to bite down my mouthpiece and finish the fight, you know

1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:44.880
 I knew I was ahead on the on the scorecard and uh, I needed to finish finish strong

1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:49.200
 So what was your strategy there in terms of strikes in terms of wrestling so he's an

1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:56.240
 Exceptionally difficult opponent to take down. Yeah. Well at at first I I I knew I would add a good jab a good

1:47:56.320 --> 1:47:58.320
 You know to stay always

1:47:58.640 --> 1:48:04.080
 From the outside, you know fight him from the outside and and use my footwork because he was like a tank

1:48:04.080 --> 1:48:06.080
 He was much bigger and much

1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:08.160
 stronger than me and uh

1:48:08.960 --> 1:48:11.280
 I didn't want never wanted to stay in front of him

1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:15.760
 So he was all the way out or all the way in and when I was coming all the way in

1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:21.200
 It was with my uh proactive or reactive takedown where I myself

1:48:21.840 --> 1:48:29.280
 initiated the takedown by uh, using a distraction like a jab to make it is is and goes up and then I go

1:48:29.840 --> 1:48:37.360
 with a single double leg or uh to react like baiting him for him to come hit me and then

1:48:37.920 --> 1:48:43.600
 While he's coming to hit me I go change level and and that's the way I like to take my time

1:48:43.600 --> 1:48:49.680
 And that's the way I like to take my opponent down, you know some guys for example, like like uh, cabbie

1:48:49.680 --> 1:48:51.680
 for example, he's very good at at

1:48:52.400 --> 1:49:00.080
 Bringing his opponent to defense and use chain wrestling to to take his opponent down. I find it for me for myself. I specialize more into

1:49:00.880 --> 1:49:03.840
 Explosive takedown in the center of the octagon because I found it

1:49:04.560 --> 1:49:06.560
 more economical for me

1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:11.440
 What what did you see you were you're commenting john about the wrestling

1:49:11.440 --> 1:49:19.280
 That was that was quite interesting. I mean also, can you generally comment on the fact that george sanpia who don't I don't think you wrestled

1:49:20.480 --> 1:49:27.200
 I wrestle I started wrestling. I was 19 years old, but I wrestled some very good russian guys. So they took me underneath their wing and

1:49:27.840 --> 1:49:29.040
 but

1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:31.200
 My ability to cover distance

1:49:31.840 --> 1:49:38.480
 Come from karate does not come from wrestling wrestling is how I finish once I got the leg how I finish the takedown

1:49:38.480 --> 1:49:43.120
 Uh, so the the timing and the movement and the explosion required for this karate. Yeah

1:49:44.480 --> 1:49:49.520
 I think an important distinction to make here is um one which george

1:49:50.240 --> 1:49:52.240
 uh made throughout his career and I

1:49:52.720 --> 1:49:55.600
 Believe george you were the greatest innovator in mma history

1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000
 um with regards to this

1:49:58.640 --> 1:50:00.640
 and this is uh

1:50:00.720 --> 1:50:05.140
 The creation of what george calls shoot boxing which is the amalgamation

1:50:05.140 --> 1:50:10.820
 Of striking technique in george's case mostly karate because that was his martial arts background

1:50:11.380 --> 1:50:15.220
 um into grappling and in particular takedowns

1:50:15.940 --> 1:50:17.780
 uh

1:50:17.780 --> 1:50:19.780
 when most people say

1:50:19.940 --> 1:50:23.540
 So and so has better wrestling in mixed martial arts

1:50:25.140 --> 1:50:30.820
 You have to be very careful what they mean by this there are many highly credentialed wrestlers

1:50:30.820 --> 1:50:36.260
 In the early days of mixed martial arts who went in and truly struggled to hit a takedown

1:50:36.900 --> 1:50:42.740
 Now these are very very good wrestlers who in a wrestling match would easily put down their opponent

1:50:43.380 --> 1:50:44.660
 but

1:50:44.660 --> 1:50:50.660
 In a striking situation where the ranges are completely different and the setups are entirely different

1:50:50.980 --> 1:50:56.980
 The stances are different even the the overall conditions are different. You're no longer wearing shoes

1:50:56.980 --> 1:51:01.940
 People underestimate just what an impact it is for a wrestler to take the shoes off

1:51:02.020 --> 1:51:05.540
 You lose like 20 of your forward drive the minute you take off the shoes

1:51:06.180 --> 1:51:07.300
 um

1:51:07.300 --> 1:51:15.060
 Uh, all of these make massive differences in whether or not you're going to be able to even make contact with an opponent for a takedown

1:51:16.980 --> 1:51:24.020
 As george pointed out the true value of wrestling in mma is finishing the takedown once you've established contact

1:51:24.020 --> 1:51:31.380
 But that's only about 20 of the action of a of a mixed martial arts takedown 80 of it is an understanding range

1:51:31.620 --> 1:51:33.620
 rhythm setup

1:51:33.780 --> 1:51:35.780
 opportunity, etc, etc, and

1:51:37.300 --> 1:51:39.060
 That's not part of wrestling at all

1:51:39.060 --> 1:51:42.740
 You're even the overall conditions are completely different in the sport of wrestling

1:51:42.740 --> 1:51:47.700
 You start a very close range in a very bent over stance and you're expected to wrestle for

1:51:48.260 --> 1:51:50.500
 In international stars for three minutes at a time

1:51:50.500 --> 1:51:54.260
 Um now suddenly you're completely upright

1:51:55.300 --> 1:51:56.340
 uh

1:51:56.340 --> 1:51:57.860
 and

1:51:57.860 --> 1:52:02.340
 You're not wearing shoes all the conditions the the the rhythm and speed of it is different

1:52:02.740 --> 1:52:07.300
 The counters are completely different. It's just an entirely different animal

1:52:07.860 --> 1:52:10.420
 And so george was an early recognizer of this

1:52:11.540 --> 1:52:15.780
 And started to put the emphasis on direct training for shoot boxing

1:52:15.780 --> 1:52:21.620
 In addition to wrestling so he practiced with very good wrestlers in the montreal wrestling club

1:52:22.420 --> 1:52:29.540
 Just the sport of wrestling and that's what made him very good at finishing takedowns, but it was in his shoot boxing training

1:52:30.420 --> 1:52:37.620
 Which he himself largely developed remember george started at a time when mma was pretty damn young

1:52:38.180 --> 1:52:40.180
 and um

1:52:40.180 --> 1:52:46.500
 Um, he we were when when you entered the sport of mixed martial arts george, it wasn't even allowed on tv

1:52:47.140 --> 1:52:49.700
 Like it was completely banned. It was in his country. It was

1:52:50.180 --> 1:52:51.540
 physically banned

1:52:51.540 --> 1:52:56.660
 Uh, they had to fight on indian reservations and you know, and this is way back in the wild west days of mma

1:52:57.380 --> 1:53:00.180
 and so as a as a young developing athlete he had to

1:53:01.140 --> 1:53:03.140
 More or less do this by himself

1:53:03.540 --> 1:53:07.700
 If you ever want to hear some incredible stories talk about teenage george saint pierre

1:53:07.700 --> 1:53:12.420
 Who had a coach who used to make him put on boxing gloves now?

1:53:12.580 --> 1:53:19.140
 He was 16 17 years old and just put him on a hardwood floor against a professional boxer who was in his

1:53:19.940 --> 1:53:24.420
 Late 20s at the peak of his career and he said george you're not allowed to punch

1:53:24.580 --> 1:53:26.740
 You just got to take him down while he tries to knock you out

1:53:27.460 --> 1:53:29.460
 And it was and it was crazy

1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:32.000
 darwinism, he was like

1:53:32.340 --> 1:53:34.340
 It's like you're gonna you're gonna

1:53:34.660 --> 1:53:36.660
 Adapt or you're gonna die

1:53:36.660 --> 1:53:40.340
 Literally and he had that it could have been very bad, but it turns out to be great

1:53:40.820 --> 1:53:41.940
 He's admitted

1:53:41.940 --> 1:53:43.940
 but there's a sense here in which

1:53:43.940 --> 1:53:49.860
 People think oh, you know what determines your takedown ability in mma as your wrestling skill

1:53:50.500 --> 1:53:51.700
 that

1:53:51.700 --> 1:53:58.180
 Your wrestling skill will determine your finishing ability on takedowns, but there's so much more to it than that

1:53:59.860 --> 1:54:02.740
 Whenever people say, you know, what what are the broad

1:54:02.740 --> 1:54:07.220
 elements that determine the outcome of a mixed martial arts fight

1:54:07.860 --> 1:54:11.460
 Okay on the broadest possible level. I always give the same three things

1:54:13.060 --> 1:54:15.460
 The athlete who can dominate the pace

1:54:16.260 --> 1:54:17.860
 of the match

1:54:17.860 --> 1:54:25.780
 The athlete who can dominate the direction of the match and the athlete who can dominate the setups will win the vast majority of fights

1:54:26.180 --> 1:54:28.180
 They're in those three things

1:54:28.180 --> 1:54:32.500
 The direction the pace and the setups you dominate all three of those

1:54:33.300 --> 1:54:36.020
 You're going to win 90 of the matches. You're in

1:54:37.140 --> 1:54:42.100
 Um, george could always dominate the direction of the fight because he could stop the other guy taking him down

1:54:42.500 --> 1:54:45.860
 And he could impose his own takedowns at any point in a match

1:54:46.020 --> 1:54:50.260
 So whether it went to ground or whether it stayed standing was always up to him

1:54:51.460 --> 1:54:54.980
 George had the most sophisticated array of setups into takedowns

1:54:54.980 --> 1:54:58.740
 That i've personally ever witnessed

1:54:59.060 --> 1:55:05.460
 um, the whole distinction between reactive and proactive takedowns came very early in george's career and

1:55:05.780 --> 1:55:09.700
 He excelled in both most people tend to favor one or the other

1:55:10.580 --> 1:55:12.980
 Most athletes have a very hard time

1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:15.860
 imposing

1:55:15.860 --> 1:55:18.500
 Their setups on an opponent and as a result they have to use

1:55:18.500 --> 1:55:25.780
 The cage as a crutch for their for their setups where they just bully someone towards the cage and then put them down on the cage

1:55:26.260 --> 1:55:30.580
 George is one of the very few people who was equally good against the cage or in the open

1:55:30.980 --> 1:55:33.080
 And could do so in both proactive and reactive

1:55:33.840 --> 1:55:35.840
 situations

1:55:37.540 --> 1:55:40.260
 And the scary thing is that as good as

1:55:41.300 --> 1:55:44.020
 All of you saw him look in the octagon

1:55:44.020 --> 1:55:50.100
 Um, anyone who knows george as a coach will tell you he was twice as good as that

1:55:50.580 --> 1:55:54.740
 In the gym where he would often go against people several weight divisions above himself

1:55:55.220 --> 1:56:00.340
 I could sit here all day. I won't name names, but I always laugh when people say oh, this is the greatest

1:56:01.300 --> 1:56:04.180
 Uh pound for pound guy of all time and i've personally seen george

1:56:05.220 --> 1:56:06.900
 Take that guy down and crush him in the gym

1:56:06.900 --> 1:56:10.900
 And I can't say anything because it's rude to talk about that in public because it's just training

1:56:10.900 --> 1:56:15.860
 But i've seen george go with people all the way up to light heavyweight some of the greatest names in the history of the sport

1:56:16.020 --> 1:56:17.860
 Put them down

1:56:17.860 --> 1:56:24.180
 Advanced position on the ground and dominate them in training. It's it's what he did during that time. I uh, george

1:56:24.180 --> 1:56:29.780
 I I got to say I deeply admire many of the things I saw you do not just in the octagon but

1:56:30.340 --> 1:56:32.340
 in training as well as um

1:56:33.060 --> 1:56:35.780
 The the impact that you had on

1:56:36.660 --> 1:56:38.660
 uh, the

1:56:38.740 --> 1:56:40.660
 the degree to which

1:56:40.660 --> 1:56:44.120
 Takedowns were used in the sport was absolutely inspirational

1:56:44.500 --> 1:56:49.380
 That's why one of one of the reasons why I always say you're one of the the only athlete I ever met who taught me

1:56:50.020 --> 1:56:56.500
 more than than I taught you because you opened my eyes to a whole new world of of shoot boxing and how

1:56:57.060 --> 1:57:01.860
 I grew up in a time when uh, you I was laughing before when you talked about sugar ray lennard

1:57:01.860 --> 1:57:06.100
 I was a kid watching that match and um, I grew up in a time where there was

1:57:06.100 --> 1:57:11.220
 Boxing and there was kickboxing and then I came to america and I learned grappling and

1:57:11.860 --> 1:57:15.220
 This young man here was the innovator when it came to the integration of the two

1:57:15.940 --> 1:57:19.640
 Well, then I have to ask because george sits here uncomfortably being complimented

1:57:20.900 --> 1:57:21.940
 um

1:57:21.940 --> 1:57:23.780
 if george saint pierre

1:57:23.780 --> 1:57:27.860
 And kabib nurmagomedov face each other in their prime who wins

1:57:28.340 --> 1:57:33.620
 Who that's a very very loaded question how yeah, like what are the different trajectories you see?

1:57:33.620 --> 1:57:40.500
 Oh, okay. How does each one win in your view if one wins or the other one wins what happened interestingly they're actually

1:57:40.980 --> 1:57:43.140
 very similar in size despite the fact that

1:57:43.780 --> 1:57:46.660
 George fought at welterweight and kabib fought it

1:57:47.220 --> 1:57:52.820
 Lightweight if you actually see them standing next to each other the of similar height. Kabib's actually a little more thick set

1:57:54.100 --> 1:58:01.620
 Yeah, he's actually heavier than you walking around. Um, uh, george walked around most of his career between 188 and 191

1:58:01.620 --> 1:58:03.620
 191 pounds

1:58:04.100 --> 1:58:06.660
 And so kabib actually would ironically have

1:58:07.380 --> 1:58:09.380
 a kind of size and strength advantage

1:58:09.540 --> 1:58:14.260
 Uh despite being in the lighter weight division that's been the general trend as mma

1:58:14.820 --> 1:58:20.100
 Has grown is that athletes will come further down and wait to make weight divisions. Um,

1:58:21.780 --> 1:58:23.140
 Uh

1:58:23.140 --> 1:58:29.940
 I believe that george has the best takedowns in history, uh in the open in the cage

1:58:29.940 --> 1:58:37.620
 Um, kabib was his great strength was using the fence to facilitate takedowns. Um,

1:58:39.700 --> 1:58:40.980
 Kabib's

1:58:40.980 --> 1:58:46.260
 Other great strength was not only his ability to take people down but to keep people down for extended periods of time

1:58:46.820 --> 1:58:48.820
 both of them were

1:58:49.060 --> 1:58:54.740
 Powerful strikers on the ground and could do terrible damage to opponents, uh on the floor

1:58:54.900 --> 1:58:57.620
 So they're both very similar in that regard

1:58:57.620 --> 1:59:04.180
 Um, kabib was mostly a uh, a puncher from the back george was mostly an elbow from the front

1:59:04.660 --> 1:59:09.220
 Um, but both of them could lay waste to opponents with strikes on the floor

1:59:09.860 --> 1:59:14.260
 Um, both of them were highly competent with submissions on the ground

1:59:14.500 --> 1:59:19.060
 They weren't submission specialists in the sense of someone like gordon ryan, but uh, they were

1:59:20.020 --> 1:59:22.020
 certainly, um

1:59:22.180 --> 1:59:24.980
 No slouches with submission holds. Um

1:59:24.980 --> 1:59:32.740
 Um, yeah, it's just a fascinating idea. So it's almost like who gets the first takedown. Yeah, I do believe

1:59:33.300 --> 1:59:34.340
 that

1:59:34.340 --> 1:59:36.420
 They could probably stand up on each other

1:59:37.140 --> 1:59:40.900
 I don't think either one of them would be able to hold the other down for a whole round

1:59:41.700 --> 1:59:45.300
 Um, both of them are notoriously difficult people to hold down

1:59:45.700 --> 1:59:49.940
 So I don't think that whoever won the first takedown wins the match. I don't think it's like that

1:59:49.940 --> 1:59:56.900
 Um, I do believe that george would hold a decisive advantage in striking and distance management

1:59:57.460 --> 2:00:00.980
 um, the few times that kabib did look shaky is

2:00:01.860 --> 2:00:03.300
 when he

2:00:03.300 --> 2:00:08.980
 Kabir was either advancing forward menacingly, but when he had to fight moving backwards

2:00:09.780 --> 2:00:16.020
 There was a definite asymmetry between his ability to fight going forwards, which is very good and his ability to fight going backwards

2:00:16.020 --> 2:00:17.620
 Which was noticeably?

2:00:17.620 --> 2:00:18.660
 weaker

2:00:18.660 --> 2:00:24.420
 Um, george would often fight both forwards and backwards. It was the giago elvis fight

2:00:25.380 --> 2:00:29.620
 Most of the standing time. Yeah, it was was going backwards. Um

2:00:30.980 --> 2:00:37.380
 That's probably the single biggest difference between the two athletes and skill level would be in the standing position

2:00:37.940 --> 2:00:40.420
 um on the ground, uh

2:00:41.780 --> 2:00:47.060
 Kabib slight edge and takedowns on the fence george slight edge and takedowns in the center

2:00:47.060 --> 2:00:48.420
 um

2:00:48.420 --> 2:00:54.180
 Ability to inflict damage on the floor roughly equal ability to fight off the back roughly equal

2:00:54.740 --> 2:00:58.580
 Ability to stand up from bottom roughly equal. It's a very very hard match

2:00:58.980 --> 2:01:00.340
 um

2:01:00.340 --> 2:01:02.340
 In terms of the biggest

2:01:02.580 --> 2:01:06.740
 difference in skill level is going to be in a standing position and so it would come down to

2:01:07.300 --> 2:01:12.580
 um, that doesn't necessarily mean that kabib would lose in the standing position. He might just push it to the fence and just

2:01:13.060 --> 2:01:15.060
 use match tactics where he

2:01:15.060 --> 2:01:18.580
 Kept the fight on the fence for significant periods of time

2:01:19.140 --> 2:01:20.180
 um

2:01:20.180 --> 2:01:24.500
 Uh, and you can win rounds in that fashion. So it's a match that could go either way

2:01:24.500 --> 2:01:27.700
 Both of them are absolutely the best that you'll ever see

2:01:27.700 --> 2:01:34.900
 I've always believed the three greatest mixed martial artists i've ever seen in my life were george saint pierre kabib. Noam, get off and john jones

2:01:35.460 --> 2:01:39.380
 Um, the three of them have some interesting similarities and differences

2:01:39.860 --> 2:01:41.860
 all three

2:01:41.860 --> 2:01:45.540
 Uh beat every single person they ever faced

2:01:46.020 --> 2:01:46.900
 um

2:01:46.900 --> 2:01:52.740
 I I know john jones officially has a loss by dq, but no one believes that was a loss

2:01:53.140 --> 2:01:54.100
 um

2:01:54.100 --> 2:01:56.740
 uh, george does have two losses, but he

2:01:57.300 --> 2:01:58.180
 uh

2:01:58.180 --> 2:02:00.180
 Defeated both athletes decisively

2:02:00.580 --> 2:02:03.780
 Uh in rematches kabib did it by having no losses

2:02:03.780 --> 2:02:11.480
 Interestingly all three athletes have at least one match which is controversial in terms of who won and who lost

2:02:11.800 --> 2:02:13.160
 um

2:02:13.160 --> 2:02:18.920
 John jones has had several matches which could have gone either way on the judge's scorecard kabib's

2:02:19.400 --> 2:02:22.520
 Uh match against glaceon t bell could have gone either way

2:02:22.920 --> 2:02:26.520
 Uh george's match with hendrix was could have gone either way

2:02:26.520 --> 2:02:34.040
 They they all had matches that they won which people would dispute the outcome. So that was a similarity between the three of them. Um,

2:02:34.760 --> 2:02:36.760
 all three of them

2:02:37.880 --> 2:02:39.880
 Have had the ability

2:02:39.880 --> 2:02:45.160
 To dominate the direction of fights when they want it to go down it goes down when they don't want it to go down

2:02:45.320 --> 2:02:46.520
 It doesn't

2:02:46.520 --> 2:02:47.640
 um

2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:51.960
 That's why I put such a heavy emphasis on that idea that a mixed martial arts champion

2:02:51.960 --> 2:02:57.640
 Must be able to determine the direction of a fight. It's the single most important attribute that they all must have

2:02:58.360 --> 2:02:59.560
 um

2:02:59.560 --> 2:03:03.480
 As to which of the three is the best it's going to come down to criteria

2:03:04.760 --> 2:03:06.760
 You you can't pull them apart

2:03:07.880 --> 2:03:13.160
 Which answer you give as to which of those three is the greatest of all time will come down to the criteria that you use

2:03:13.800 --> 2:03:15.800
 Okay, is it being undefeated?

2:03:15.800 --> 2:03:16.680
 um

2:03:16.680 --> 2:03:22.600
 Uh, is it the amount of time was it the quality of the opponents that they had if you do it by quality of opponents?

2:03:22.680 --> 2:03:26.760
 I think you probably have to give it to george if you do it by um

2:03:27.240 --> 2:03:31.080
 Uh measured dominance through not being defeated and it has to go to compete

2:03:31.640 --> 2:03:33.000
 um

2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:35.720
 Arguably you could say the same with john jones since his one

2:03:36.820 --> 2:03:38.820
 losses

2:03:39.880 --> 2:03:40.840
 By dq

2:03:40.840 --> 2:03:46.840
 But then you could also say the last three or four fights that john's had haven't been the same measure of dominance as we saw

2:03:46.900 --> 2:03:47.960
 previously

2:03:47.960 --> 2:03:49.240
 so ultimately

2:03:49.240 --> 2:03:51.240
 You've got those three guys in my opinion

2:03:51.640 --> 2:03:57.720
 And which one you choose will come down to who it says more about who you are as a viewer than it does about

2:03:57.960 --> 2:04:04.280
 The respective label of the athletes you could throw a blanket over them. The three of them are just that good and um

2:04:04.280 --> 2:04:11.720
 Uh, and which one you select will probably say more about who you are as a viewer than it does about them as athletes

2:04:12.280 --> 2:04:16.680
 I I believe the best fighter the goat is not even born

2:04:17.800 --> 2:04:18.680
 because

2:04:18.680 --> 2:04:20.680
 the generation

2:04:20.840 --> 2:04:22.840
 That is present

2:04:22.920 --> 2:04:24.920
 Benefit of a huge advantage

2:04:25.720 --> 2:04:29.000
 They have knowledge technology that we didn't have before

2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:33.560
 And we had the the knowledge that the other generation did not have before

2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:35.880
 but

2:04:35.880 --> 2:04:41.400
 I believe the best the goat is not even born yet as good as they are today. I think you

2:04:41.880 --> 2:04:45.880
 In sport where you can measure the performance, uh track and field

2:04:46.440 --> 2:04:48.760
 Olympic lifting you can you know someone

2:04:49.400 --> 2:04:56.680
 Is better than the other one because you can measure the performance fighting. It's all subjective. We always debate of who would win

2:04:57.160 --> 2:04:58.360
 but

2:04:58.360 --> 2:05:00.840
 10 the tendency in sport

2:05:01.720 --> 2:05:02.840
 is that

2:05:02.840 --> 2:05:06.120
 Performance get better. I don't think it's because the athlete necessarily get better

2:05:06.200 --> 2:05:09.400
 It's because they have access to better technology knowledge

2:05:10.120 --> 2:05:12.120
 And they learn from their predecessor

2:05:13.880 --> 2:05:15.880
 As long as that knowledge is transferred forward

2:05:16.200 --> 2:05:23.080
 Something tells me that the greatest of all time lived a few thousand years ago and it's forgotten some of the greatest warriors

2:05:23.080 --> 2:05:28.360
 Like you imagine the kind of grapplers. We just the history didn't record them

2:05:29.320 --> 2:05:33.100
 There could have been small tribes where they developed many ufcs

2:05:33.880 --> 2:05:38.200
 And they've developed the kind of things we you have to think of like, uh, the gracies

2:05:38.680 --> 2:05:41.640
 Just a small family was able to develop so much so quickly

2:05:42.600 --> 2:05:43.800
 I often

2:05:43.800 --> 2:05:50.280
 As this this discussion with john and I think it's very important like to mention I asked you very several times like

2:05:50.280 --> 2:05:52.680
 What would happen if we would take?

2:05:53.480 --> 2:05:59.080
 A fighter of modern days facing the champion of pancration. This is an interesting question

2:05:59.080 --> 2:06:04.680
 And you brought some incredible good point and and people don't don't realize it, you know

2:06:04.760 --> 2:06:11.800
 yeah, no, I think um, one of the great tragedies of martial arts history is our loss of

2:06:12.680 --> 2:06:17.000
 uh, the historical records of pancration like most of what we know was

2:06:17.000 --> 2:06:22.300
 Uh from what i'm told is actually lost in the fires of the library of alexandria

2:06:22.840 --> 2:06:27.560
 And we're left with only a pitiful amount of information on uh pancration matches

2:06:28.440 --> 2:06:31.800
 But what we do know is that there was a very

2:06:32.440 --> 2:06:33.400
 large

2:06:33.400 --> 2:06:35.800
 uh participation in the sport and that it was

2:06:36.440 --> 2:06:38.440
 Why they considered the most popular

2:06:39.160 --> 2:06:45.480
 Sport in the ancient olympics and that it was represented in the ancient olympics for many hundreds of years

2:06:45.480 --> 2:06:49.340
 Plus a long period of time before its introduction into the ancient olympics

2:06:50.040 --> 2:06:52.040
 And so the development time

2:06:52.360 --> 2:06:55.320
 That it may have had would have been very significant it

2:06:56.920 --> 2:07:02.680
 Uh as far as we know most of the development would have been in the major greek city states for

2:07:03.800 --> 2:07:05.960
 Uh, literally hundreds of years of development

2:07:06.280 --> 2:07:14.280
 Um given its prestige as an olympic sport then the best athletes would have been doing it some of the sharpest minds that we know of

2:07:14.280 --> 2:07:20.440
 In human history were involved in the sport. Um, plato the great philosopher

2:07:21.480 --> 2:07:22.840
 uh

2:07:22.840 --> 2:07:28.040
 Was a pancreasianist in his youth. In fact, his name plato is a nickname

2:07:28.840 --> 2:07:30.840
 platus is like plate

2:07:30.920 --> 2:07:35.240
 it means broad or big guy like the big guy and um

2:07:36.120 --> 2:07:40.280
 Uh, he spoke often about pancreasian and in his written works

2:07:40.280 --> 2:07:44.600
 Um, imagine people with the intelligence of plato

2:07:45.960 --> 2:07:47.800
 thinking about

2:07:47.800 --> 2:07:52.360
 Grappling technique for hundreds of years in the most popular olympic sport of that time

2:07:53.300 --> 2:07:55.300
 significant numbers of people with

2:07:55.560 --> 2:08:01.400
 Financial backing as city states put great prestige upon olympic success. They would have funneled athletes in

2:08:01.400 --> 2:08:09.720
 And brought in the best coaches and they had that for many hundreds of years like it's quite conceivable that the best pancreasian athletes

2:08:09.720 --> 2:08:15.720
 were of the absolute first quality and um, uh, it it's

2:08:16.520 --> 2:08:20.120
 It's so sad to think we'll never know. What was their skill level and uh,

2:08:20.920 --> 2:08:24.120
 It's interesting to think about what kind of techniques they developed whether

2:08:25.320 --> 2:08:29.240
 There's stuff we haven't discovered yet in class. You're talking about the most effective

2:08:29.240 --> 2:08:36.040
 Of takedown strategy in wrestling and collegiate wrestling. So maybe let me ask first, uh, because we offline talked about this, too

2:08:36.440 --> 2:08:44.200
 What is the highest percentage submission in grappling overall? You have to go with the rear naked strangle strangles from the back

2:08:44.840 --> 2:08:47.880
 If you look at most tournaments and most rule sets

2:08:48.520 --> 2:08:53.000
 It has success across all rule sets. Um, all weight divisions

2:08:53.640 --> 2:08:57.800
 All body types. It doesn't require any kind of specific

2:08:57.800 --> 2:09:01.720
 Physical advantage such as height, uh in order to be effective

2:09:02.360 --> 2:09:06.120
 Um, it works equally well in both fighting and grappling. Um

2:09:06.920 --> 2:09:11.720
 It will work regardless of how physically and mentally tough your opponent is. Okay

2:09:11.720 --> 2:09:16.520
 A heel hook is a very high percentage technique in in modern day competition

2:09:17.240 --> 2:09:23.320
 But if your opponent simply makes up his mind that he's not going to tap and is willing to take the physical damage

2:09:23.320 --> 2:09:30.280
 It won't result in the end of a match a strangle hold by contrast will always end the match regardless of

2:09:30.680 --> 2:09:32.680
 Your opponent's mental toughness

2:09:32.680 --> 2:09:38.380
 So, um, I believe it's fair to say that at the end of the day the single most high percentage

2:09:39.400 --> 2:09:46.040
 method of uh submitting people and grappling is the rear naked strangle. So when you look at an athlete, maybe Gordon you could speak to this like

2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:49.960
 What's the best, uh, you mentioned Gary with the guillotine

2:09:49.960 --> 2:09:53.880
 What's the best submission to really invest in? Is it the rear naked choke?

2:09:54.600 --> 2:09:59.400
 To really invest your development like understanding the entirety of the system that leads into that

2:09:59.800 --> 2:10:02.120
 Uh, I think that I mean you have to do them all obviously

2:10:02.120 --> 2:10:06.600
 But if I had like one submission that I would only one submission I could pick for the rest of my life

2:10:06.600 --> 2:10:08.600
 It would definitely be a rear naked

2:10:08.840 --> 2:10:14.040
 Can you explain maybe some of the actual technical details of why that's the case?

2:10:14.600 --> 2:10:18.040
 Well as John spoke about they're different in joint locks. Whereas

2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:23.960
 You don't have to tap you can just let your leg break and then keep going with the strangle. There's there's no, uh,

2:10:24.680 --> 2:10:27.480
 There's none of that. Um, and then it's just an inherent

2:10:28.680 --> 2:10:30.680
 Advantage you have being behind someone

2:10:31.160 --> 2:10:35.720
 Um, whereas if you go for an armbar you stop you start from top mount and you're facing the guy and then you put them

2:10:35.720 --> 2:10:38.760
 Down and you're not directly behind them with leg locks. You're facing the guy

2:10:39.480 --> 2:10:43.800
 Whereas when you're on someone's back you have them in a pin where you can your chest to back

2:10:43.800 --> 2:10:48.440
 You have a body triangle and you're pinning the guy in place. He can't explode out. He can't grease his way out

2:10:48.440 --> 2:10:52.920
 Most of the time, uh, and there's an inherent advantage you have being behind them due to the fact that

2:10:53.400 --> 2:10:56.280
 We're poorly set up to deal with threats behind us

2:10:57.080 --> 2:11:01.720
 So would you say that's the most dominant position jiu jitsu like more than mount?

2:11:02.520 --> 2:11:04.120
 More than yeah

2:11:04.120 --> 2:11:08.200
 Sack control more than I think uh, if you look at most matches historically

2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:10.920
 Most guys who get stuck in positions

2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:14.920
 For long amounts of time are guys that they're back taking. Um, if you get

2:11:15.400 --> 2:11:20.680
 An explosive guy from bottom mountain bridge and he can off balance you and lock half guard maybe and then work back to guard

2:11:20.680 --> 2:11:26.600
 But if someone locks a body triangle on your back, um, that's where you see most guys getting pinned in place for long amounts of time

2:11:28.200 --> 2:11:31.800
 Was uh was the body triangle like a well understood thing

2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:37.720
 Was that an invention at some point like as a system as a as a control

2:11:37.720 --> 2:11:44.120
 Yeah, um, perhaps some of your your listeners can correct me on this but I believe there was a technique banned in judo called dojime

2:11:44.840 --> 2:11:51.320
 Which involved crossing feet or locking a triangle around the abdominals from the back and it was banned in judo

2:11:51.880 --> 2:11:59.160
 I believe because uh of intestinal injuries which occurred in the early developmental days of of judo

2:12:00.120 --> 2:12:01.160
 and

2:12:01.160 --> 2:12:02.840
 in the modern era

2:12:02.840 --> 2:12:07.960
 When I first began jiu jitsu body triangles were relatively rare. They were not a standard part of class

2:12:08.920 --> 2:12:16.600
 Um, and sometime around the late 1990s early 2000s people started to realize hey, this is a stronger method of control

2:12:17.400 --> 2:12:18.600
 um

2:12:18.600 --> 2:12:19.960
 it

2:12:19.960 --> 2:12:25.800
 It greatly increases the amount of control you have over your of your opponent's hips and torso over regular hooks

2:12:25.800 --> 2:12:32.520
 Uh, it's not for all athletes. It's difficult for most people who are of shorter thicker statue, uh, to

2:12:33.320 --> 2:12:39.000
 Employ on on on big people if your opponent's very broadly built through the stomach. It's almost impossible to apply

2:12:39.880 --> 2:12:45.480
 And so because it can't be applied by all people it tends not to be taught much at beginner level

2:12:46.520 --> 2:12:50.120
 So as a result, it was always seen as a

2:12:50.920 --> 2:12:52.920
 kind of a speciality

2:12:52.920 --> 2:13:00.520
 It was always seen as a kind of a specialist move for taller athletes at a higher level of competition rather than a broad

2:13:00.520 --> 2:13:04.520
 Base move for everyone or every body type in every class to employ

2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:08.520
 So it just didn't get emphasized that much but in top level competition now

2:13:08.840 --> 2:13:15.880
 I think you would see that it's very apparent that the vast majority of athletes whenever they have the opportunity or a choice between

2:13:16.200 --> 2:13:22.040
 Body triangle and regular rear mounts the majority of modern athletes would use a body triangle

2:13:22.040 --> 2:13:28.940
 So we also had this conversation about wrestling. Maybe georgie can comment on like what what's the uh, the highest percentage?

2:13:29.240 --> 2:13:36.600
 Not statistically speaking. Perhaps that's also interesting as john talked about but just for you in terms of mastery of a takedown

2:13:36.600 --> 2:13:39.640
 What's what's the best way to take down a human being?

2:13:40.600 --> 2:13:42.600
 in wrestling well, I

2:13:42.920 --> 2:13:44.920
 Personally for me, it depends

2:13:45.320 --> 2:13:48.920
 For every fighter are different. They have a different set of skill

2:13:48.920 --> 2:13:51.560
 For me, I when I look someone

2:13:52.520 --> 2:13:56.360
 Want to bring down a tree a big strong high tree

2:13:57.320 --> 2:13:59.320
 He cut it from the base

2:13:59.640 --> 2:14:05.400
 So the legs that that's what we stand on so it was to attack the leg

2:14:05.400 --> 2:14:08.600
 But is it single leg double leg? Is it we talked about like, uh,

2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:15.560
 Well, there's also the the john smith low single. Actually, I don't even know if that's applicable for jiu jitsu at all

2:14:15.560 --> 2:14:20.840
 Applicable for jiu jitsu at all. You you can use it, but it runs into the problem with submission holds

2:14:20.920 --> 2:14:28.920
 Yeah, it's it's not impossible to use but without shoes and in a situation where there's a whole plethora of submission holds in the scoring

2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:32.840
 It's a little more difficult to use, you know

2:14:33.720 --> 2:14:38.760
 It is interesting something being a high percentage in terms of effectiveness tells a story

2:14:39.160 --> 2:14:43.800
 You're saying that every athlete is different. But if it's more effective for most people

2:14:43.800 --> 2:14:48.520
 I mean, it's interesting. It's it's interesting what john talked about is that

2:14:49.240 --> 2:14:52.440
 the highest percentage thing is actually, um

2:14:53.400 --> 2:14:55.480
 In collegiate wrestling that he was talking about is

2:14:56.280 --> 2:15:01.240
 On the defensive side, so blocking a takedown and spinning around to the to the back

2:15:02.520 --> 2:15:09.320
 So that's an interesting idea then also there's all of these kind of going in for a singleness switching to a double or

2:15:09.320 --> 2:15:15.080
 Or wizard position and doing knee tap like there's all these kinds of combinations that seem to be

2:15:15.480 --> 2:15:21.240
 Effective when you look at the statistics and it seems like there's maybe it's a scientific way of thinking but it seems like there is

2:15:22.120 --> 2:15:27.560
 Some conclusion to be drawn there. Oh, yeah, I believe you need to the high percentage move

2:15:27.720 --> 2:15:29.720
 There's a reason why it works. I think it's

2:15:30.600 --> 2:15:31.880
 It's made

2:15:31.880 --> 2:15:33.880
 for a bigger amount of people

2:15:34.040 --> 2:15:35.080
 um

2:15:35.080 --> 2:15:37.080
 For example, I one of my main

2:15:37.080 --> 2:15:39.080
 strength

2:15:39.080 --> 2:15:41.320
 Athletic strength is i'm an explosive person

2:15:41.640 --> 2:15:46.760
 So i'll use technique that are explosive if I got a single leg my my one of my thing

2:15:46.840 --> 2:15:49.400
 I like to do is to go for the double power double

2:15:50.360 --> 2:15:51.880
 but for uh

2:15:51.880 --> 2:15:56.520
 Someone else we got for example in a single leg position. Maybe he likes

2:15:57.080 --> 2:16:03.480
 Like body throw better. He's more a greco guy like so or he's a judo guy. He's gonna go for something something else. So

2:16:03.480 --> 2:16:10.280
 But there there is move that are I would say like you just mentioned are universal like statistically speaking. They're

2:16:10.920 --> 2:16:18.440
 The highest percentage move that works for pretty much everybody everybody pretty much can do a an adhaka jimmy, you know

2:16:18.440 --> 2:16:19.800
 It's very easy

2:16:19.800 --> 2:16:23.960
 But it's not everybody that can lock a triangle with their legs

2:16:24.040 --> 2:16:31.320
 So so those move like a rear naked choke adhaka jimmy is the highest percentage move because it's maybe

2:16:31.320 --> 2:16:33.320
 It's maybe more accessible

2:16:33.720 --> 2:16:37.880
 It's accessible for a bigger range. Yeah based on the physical characteristics of the people

2:16:38.120 --> 2:16:45.080
 Do you draw any wisdom from these high percentages john for like in terms of what to focus on? Yeah, absolutely

2:16:45.240 --> 2:16:49.400
 Um juditsu has an ocean of moves and you can get lost on that ocean

2:16:49.960 --> 2:16:54.120
 You can drift for a long period of time and and and that was very little to show for it

2:16:54.440 --> 2:16:57.640
 So my whole thing is focus. We only live one lifetime

2:16:57.640 --> 2:17:01.560
 And your training lifetime is even shorter than your actual lifetime

2:17:02.280 --> 2:17:03.160
 so

2:17:03.160 --> 2:17:04.680
 in that time

2:17:04.680 --> 2:17:06.680
 I must die on the mat

2:17:07.800 --> 2:17:09.800
 That is the same. Yeah

2:17:10.440 --> 2:17:14.840
 Uh, I I put a very high value on

2:17:15.720 --> 2:17:18.380
 Choosing what I believe to be the most high percentage

2:17:19.320 --> 2:17:23.240
 Uh moves and putting an extraordinary amount of focus on them

2:17:23.240 --> 2:17:30.680
 Um, the only problem is that in one generation a move which can be considered low percentage might actually turn out to be high

2:17:30.760 --> 2:17:32.760
 Percentage in another generation, for example

2:17:33.320 --> 2:17:39.320
 We talked earlier about leg locks when I was first started judice. They were considered the ultimate low percentage move and

2:17:39.880 --> 2:17:43.640
 Uh a big part of my career has been convincing people that in fact that was

2:17:43.960 --> 2:17:48.680
 That was incorrect that they can be a high percentage move if we just change our approach to them

2:17:49.400 --> 2:17:50.440
 um

2:17:50.440 --> 2:17:52.120
 so we can't just

2:17:52.120 --> 2:17:53.720
 Follow tradition

2:17:53.720 --> 2:17:57.400
 And say oh, this is low percentage. This is high percentage. It has to be part of

2:17:58.120 --> 2:18:01.260
 a fairly systematic study where you investigate

2:18:02.440 --> 2:18:08.600
 What are the reasons why it's high percentage or low percentage with regards to takedowns?

2:18:09.160 --> 2:18:11.160
 If you look at what?

2:18:11.160 --> 2:18:13.800
 We can consider the most high percentage takedowns

2:18:13.880 --> 2:18:19.080
 If you're in front of someone the single most high percentage way of taking them down is to get a hold of both of their legs

2:18:19.080 --> 2:18:20.920
 And push them backwards

2:18:20.920 --> 2:18:24.040
 Okay, if you get a hold of one of their legs and put a force on them

2:18:24.280 --> 2:18:26.920
 They can use their other leg to defend themselves and hop around and

2:18:27.400 --> 2:18:30.120
 Funk their way out of takedowns and cause all kinds of problems for you

2:18:30.600 --> 2:18:33.960
 I don't care how athletic your opponent is if you get a hold a firm grip

2:18:34.680 --> 2:18:38.120
 Of both of his legs and start pushing him backwards. He's going to fall down to his butt

2:18:38.520 --> 2:18:41.320
 Now he might be able to recover from there, but he will fall down

2:18:42.440 --> 2:18:44.920
 Even easier than that is to be behind someone

2:18:44.920 --> 2:18:50.680
 Takedowns from in front of someone are difficult you go right into their hips their head their hands

2:18:50.760 --> 2:18:55.960
 You go into all their defensive weapons. If you're already behind someone and you're doing what in america

2:18:55.960 --> 2:19:01.160
 They refer to as a mat return. This is significantly easier than taking someone down from the front

2:19:01.960 --> 2:19:04.840
 If you have control of their head in a front headlock position

2:19:06.120 --> 2:19:11.160
 You have already closed distance on your opponent. You already have close contact. You don't have to worry about shooting anymore

2:19:11.160 --> 2:19:16.600
 There's no sprawl out of that. You don't have to worry about guillotines kimoras or the uh, standard defenses

2:19:16.680 --> 2:19:20.120
 Those will intrinsically be easier takedowns out of front headlock

2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:24.840
 And so if we're going to talk about high percentage technique, I always go back to the mechanics of it

2:19:25.400 --> 2:19:31.480
 Rather than just historical tradition because historical tradition can be wrong. It was wrong about leg locks

2:19:31.880 --> 2:19:33.880
 It can be wrong about other things too

2:19:34.040 --> 2:19:36.780
 So my primary thing is okay. Talk to me about mechanics

2:19:36.780 --> 2:19:41.500
 That's what ultimately is going to determine whether something is high percentage or not. Um,

2:19:41.900 --> 2:19:47.340
 Gordon pointed out earlier that when you're behind someone you have innate physical advantages over the other guy the human

2:19:47.340 --> 2:19:51.900
 We the human body is set up entirely to to defend threats from the front

2:19:52.620 --> 2:19:57.900
 We are poorly adapted to defending threats from the rear. We don't have eyes in the back of our head

2:19:57.900 --> 2:19:59.900
 We can't apply pushing strength backwards

2:20:00.220 --> 2:20:05.900
 If you get behind someone take downs are 10 times easier from behind someone than they are when you're in front of someone

2:20:05.900 --> 2:20:09.740
 If you have to take someone down from the front get a hold of both of their legs

2:20:10.220 --> 2:20:14.940
 If you can get a hold of both of their legs and impart a pushing force, you will almost always knock them down

2:20:17.820 --> 2:20:19.820
 If you can get a hold of their head

2:20:20.380 --> 2:20:22.220
 And work takedowns from there again

2:20:22.220 --> 2:20:28.300
 It's much easier because most of their defensive apparatus is being taken away from them before the takedown even begins

2:20:28.700 --> 2:20:29.660
 and so

2:20:29.660 --> 2:20:33.980
 For me, the most high percentage takedowns will always be from the front double legs

2:20:33.980 --> 2:20:40.140
 From the front double legs from any takedown from the back is going to be significantly easier than any takedown from the front

2:20:40.460 --> 2:20:44.140
 So all manner of matte return takedowns are going to be very high percentage

2:20:44.700 --> 2:20:45.820
 um

2:20:45.820 --> 2:20:51.500
 And takedowns done out of situations where the opponent is broken down in front of you and you have either front headlock or front

2:20:51.580 --> 2:20:55.420
 Chest wrap position are going to be significantly easier than takedowns from the open

2:20:56.380 --> 2:20:58.700
 Of course, you have to consider the full

2:20:58.700 --> 2:21:06.560
 Full spectrum of mechanics involved here. It's possible that an outside low single leading to a double leg is much higher percentage

2:21:07.280 --> 2:21:09.600
 It's like there's a lot of chain wrestling yet

2:21:09.680 --> 2:21:14.800
 You know that needs to be considered as a possibility maybe a straight on and part of this cultural too

2:21:15.360 --> 2:21:19.360
 Are people afraid of this kind of thing that they came to be the case with leg locks?

2:21:19.760 --> 2:21:21.680
 Are people aware of this?

2:21:21.680 --> 2:21:24.880
 Are they worried about this? Are they training for this to defend this?

2:21:24.880 --> 2:21:31.600
 And and then this opponent specific of course that um, you know with jordan boros people are preparing for the double

2:21:31.600 --> 2:21:33.600
 Which is why he had to develop

2:21:34.800 --> 2:21:40.000
 A whole other kinds of different stuff and then the head to all the different controls all the different ties

2:21:40.560 --> 2:21:42.400
 within the rule set

2:21:42.400 --> 2:21:47.440
 And that's where it's so fascinating to see the effect of rule set on all this judo over the past

2:21:47.840 --> 2:21:54.240
 I think 20 years went through this every olympics different changes to the rule set like fundamentally different

2:21:54.240 --> 2:22:00.800
 In terms of what's allowed to grip whether you're allowed to touch the legs at all. That was a big one in 2012, I think

2:22:01.920 --> 2:22:04.560
 And and that changed the sport completely and so interesting

2:22:04.720 --> 2:22:09.760
 It's so interesting to watch how tiny change in the rule can change the sport

2:22:10.240 --> 2:22:13.680
 At the highest when you're talking about people competing at the highest level

2:22:14.560 --> 2:22:16.480
 and the cool thing there is

2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:20.800
 The rule change happens on a scale of every four years

2:22:20.800 --> 2:22:26.580
 So you get to see people that are at the top of their game have to like recompute

2:22:27.840 --> 2:22:31.520
 So it's not like you have a new generation of people coming up with the rules. They have to figure oh shit

2:22:31.520 --> 2:22:36.720
 You're not allowed to like it's it's the equivalent of saying you're not allowed to kick anymore in mma

2:22:37.680 --> 2:22:40.560
 Because you were not allowed to grab legs anymore in judo

2:22:41.580 --> 2:22:47.600
 interestingly if you look at the case of judo if you look at the world rankings

2:22:48.480 --> 2:22:50.000
 of athletes

2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:57.360
 When they went through one of the most significant rule changes in judo history where they banned any form of grabbing the legs

2:22:58.720 --> 2:23:01.440
 The ranking of athletes didn't change much

2:23:02.720 --> 2:23:06.480
 Yeah, that tells you that they're um, there's a reason why those guys are at the top

2:23:06.560 --> 2:23:09.840
 Yeah, and it doesn't have to do that. They're specific to a rule set

2:23:10.640 --> 2:23:12.640
 Yeah, think about that in terms of

2:23:13.280 --> 2:23:16.560
 Imagine for example in mixed martial arts if they just said hey

2:23:17.200 --> 2:23:18.880
 starting next week

2:23:18.880 --> 2:23:22.320
 Instead of having three five minute rounds. It's going to be 15 minutes straight

2:23:23.200 --> 2:23:26.640
 That would massively change the preparation of the athletes

2:23:27.680 --> 2:23:32.900
 It's a different game at that point and judo literally was a different game before 2010 and after 2010

2:23:33.760 --> 2:23:35.200
 and yet

2:23:35.200 --> 2:23:40.240
 The international rankings didn't really change that much the countries that were dominant before

2:23:40.800 --> 2:23:45.760
 Remained dominant the athletes that remained before largely remained the same

2:23:45.760 --> 2:23:54.000
 You would think was such a massive change all the rankings would have been thrown upside down, but they weren't and uh, again

2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:58.720
 It goes back to this idea that there's a reason why the guys at the top are at the top

2:24:00.080 --> 2:24:07.360
 And now for something completely different we talked about aliens earlier. Yeah, so uh, george brought up babasar. I I um,

2:24:08.240 --> 2:24:11.680
 will likely probably talk to babasar on this podcast and then um

2:24:11.680 --> 2:24:20.000
 Um, and then john had this a skeptical look on his face about about aliens. So let me ask uh, john and gordon

2:24:20.880 --> 2:24:26.640
 Uh, do you think there's intelligent alien civilizations out there in the universe outside of our own?

2:24:27.120 --> 2:24:29.760
 The universe is unimaginably large

2:24:30.240 --> 2:24:36.080
 the idea that we are the only life forms in a cosmos as large as this is

2:24:37.840 --> 2:24:39.840
 I think naive and foolish

2:24:39.840 --> 2:24:41.840
 um

2:24:41.840 --> 2:24:46.960
 There's a very high likelihood that if life could evolve on this planet that it could have done

2:24:47.040 --> 2:24:51.120
 So on many many other planets around the uh around the cosmos

2:24:51.600 --> 2:24:56.000
 I think anyone who puts even a moment's thought into this would realize that there's

2:24:56.560 --> 2:24:58.880
 Almost certainly other forms of life out there

2:24:59.760 --> 2:25:05.520
 the real question with regards the alien community is um, have they got here and are they

2:25:05.520 --> 2:25:12.720
 Yeah, circling our planet in um little silver saucers and making observations and periodically stealing people

2:25:13.360 --> 2:25:18.640
 For experimentation purposes doesn't have to be silver saucers. It could be different other color saucers

2:25:18.800 --> 2:25:23.520
 Um, and that question i'm i'm i'm not at all convinced. No, I I don't think

2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:25.040
 recently

2:25:25.040 --> 2:25:27.040
 um navy footage

2:25:27.200 --> 2:25:29.200
 has come out showing

2:25:29.200 --> 2:25:37.120
 Some very interesting phenomena if you talk to almost any experienced pilot they will tell you they've seen things in the upper atmosphere

2:25:37.200 --> 2:25:39.200
 That are very difficult to explain

2:25:39.520 --> 2:25:41.520
 Uh, i'll be the first one to agree with you on this

2:25:41.520 --> 2:25:47.040
 There are some things out there that are extremely difficult to explain like literally ufos unidentified

2:25:47.200 --> 2:25:49.200
 Yeah, I mean we just don't know what they are

2:25:49.280 --> 2:25:53.680
 but to go from the idea that there's things out there that we don't understand to

2:25:55.040 --> 2:25:56.160
 there's

2:25:56.160 --> 2:25:57.120
 like

2:25:57.120 --> 2:26:02.000
 Little creatures running around and um, uh, and these somehow exist. Uh,

2:26:02.880 --> 2:26:08.080
 I just reserve judgment. I just say i'm agnostic about these things. I think it's possible but

2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:08.960
 um

2:26:08.960 --> 2:26:14.880
 all the evidence that i've been showing so far was insufficient to come to any kind of definite conclusions until

2:26:15.520 --> 2:26:19.520
 Aliens land in central park on tuesday afternoon at 3 p.m

2:26:19.840 --> 2:26:23.440
 And get out with little alien ray guns and start shooting people. I didn't believe in

2:26:24.400 --> 2:26:26.400
 Many of the stories that get told

2:26:26.400 --> 2:26:33.280
 Well, what about if it's not little aliens with ray guns, but something very different very very difficult to detect for us humans

2:26:33.760 --> 2:26:40.000
 That's very human central creature at that point. It's a it's a fascinating idea and it's certainly possible, but show me the evidence

2:26:41.760 --> 2:26:43.760
 All right, what about you gordon

2:26:44.320 --> 2:26:51.200
 Do you do you uh look at the cosmos and ponder the stars often? I think it's fair points. John raised

2:26:51.760 --> 2:26:53.920
 uh, something really interesting I saw the other day was uh,

2:26:53.920 --> 2:26:58.020
 Someone posted like if an alien organ or a civilization

2:26:58.800 --> 2:27:00.800
 65 million light years away

2:27:00.800 --> 2:27:03.680
 Somehow managed to look at earth

2:27:04.240 --> 2:27:10.000
 They would theoretically see the dinosaurs because they're 65 million light years away. So like imagine us looking at

2:27:10.560 --> 2:27:15.280
 Galaxies that are 100 million light years away. That's 100 million years ago. You have no idea what it looks like now

2:27:15.600 --> 2:27:17.600
 Um, so that's super interesting to me about it

2:27:17.600 --> 2:27:23.680
 Yeah, the the expanse is huge and so much cool stuff could be going out there. Yeah, and um,

2:27:24.400 --> 2:27:27.520
 The scary thing of course is if they haven't visited us yet

2:27:28.320 --> 2:27:29.840
 the

2:27:29.840 --> 2:27:31.840
 There has to be a good reason for it

2:27:31.920 --> 2:27:38.720
 And the the set of scary reasons of all the fact that they maybe once you get sufficiently advanced in your development

2:27:38.800 --> 2:27:42.400
 You destroy yourself naturally as humans seem to be approaching now

2:27:42.400 --> 2:27:47.840
 We more and more have the tools to destroy ourselves completely in terms of our weapon systems

2:27:49.200 --> 2:27:52.800
 Um, and we're developing them more and more and they're becoming better and better

2:27:53.440 --> 2:27:57.120
 And then we're starting to get angry and anger on twitter and instagram at each other

2:27:58.560 --> 2:28:00.560
 Those are good points you're raising

2:28:01.520 --> 2:28:03.520
 History has taught us that

2:28:03.840 --> 2:28:08.320
 Everything that lives one day will die. So we will we will perish one day. Yeah

2:28:08.320 --> 2:28:12.960
 There's also just the the sheer difficulty of um, of

2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:18.340
 Of travel through space like space is an unimaginably inhospitable

2:28:19.340 --> 2:28:20.320
 environment

2:28:20.320 --> 2:28:22.320
 And to the best of our knowledge

2:28:24.800 --> 2:28:29.920
 This even the theoretical speeds that we can attain in space even if we could

2:28:30.800 --> 2:28:33.920
 Travel at the speed of light. We're not even remotely close to that

2:28:33.920 --> 2:28:40.000
 Still the distances that need to be traveled to get to even relatively close solar systems. Um,

2:28:40.640 --> 2:28:43.540
 Very very long if you look at astronauts

2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:48.320
 Who have spent significant amounts of time in space just orbiting the earth?

2:28:48.480 --> 2:28:53.040
 It has severe health effects on them. We're just not built for space. We're supposed to be

2:28:53.680 --> 2:28:59.840
 In a gravitational environment, but we you're referring to your biological meat bag that's containing the essence

2:28:59.840 --> 2:29:03.440
 Of the mind that is john donahoe. Maybe we can transfer the mind

2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:05.200
 alone

2:29:05.200 --> 2:29:09.280
 The the the the bag the meat the meat bag is not designed for space

2:29:09.280 --> 2:29:12.080
 But maybe the but again, this is all that's of the mind. It's

2:29:13.280 --> 2:29:18.660
 It's possible, but what do you think of concrete evidence you folks who like difficult things?

2:29:20.080 --> 2:29:23.380
 Uh, what do you think about uh, elon musk going to colonize mars?

2:29:24.960 --> 2:29:26.960
 Is this something that's going to happen?

2:29:26.960 --> 2:29:33.600
 Colonize mars. Is this something you find an interesting or a um,

2:29:35.920 --> 2:29:39.600
 Aimless pursuit. I think it's a must or a salvation

2:29:39.920 --> 2:29:46.240
 We need to leave at some point the planet because historically in the past we know that we've been bombarded by a steroid

2:29:46.780 --> 2:29:48.240
 volcano

2:29:48.240 --> 2:29:52.880
 There are crazy things happen here. It's very unstable. You know, we if you look at it to

2:29:52.880 --> 2:29:59.440
 To a lifetime of a human being it's nothing but just look 12 000 years ago. What happened, you know, so so

2:29:59.840 --> 2:30:03.680
 There is cataclysm that happen all the time. It's very unstable. So

2:30:04.400 --> 2:30:10.000
 if we want to survive as a species, I think it's it's we need to get out to be able to get out and

2:30:10.640 --> 2:30:12.080
 spread our seed

2:30:12.080 --> 2:30:16.240
 so these are the early steps on a on a really long journey, but is there something about like

2:30:16.240 --> 2:30:22.500
 You know, we we don't get that exploration from most of modern society, you know, the kind of exploring that people did throughout the centuries

2:30:23.040 --> 2:30:25.040
 of uh, you know coming to the

2:30:25.600 --> 2:30:31.360
 North america just throughout we were shrouded in physical uncertainty of what's out there

2:30:32.320 --> 2:30:34.960
 And now we get to do the same kind of exploration with mars

2:30:35.520 --> 2:30:42.240
 Is there so I mean is there any aspect of you that wants to travel out to space that wants to travel to mars?

2:30:42.240 --> 2:30:45.760
 There, you know, the goal is to allow civilians to travel

2:30:46.720 --> 2:30:48.560
 Perhaps in our lifetime

2:30:48.560 --> 2:30:51.220
 Meaning affordably you can do so now unaffordably

2:30:52.400 --> 2:30:57.440
 Traveling to space and traveling to mars are two different things. I think I would like to travel into space

2:30:58.400 --> 2:31:02.160
 I don't know if I would like to travel all the way to mars because of the risks involved

2:31:03.600 --> 2:31:05.120
 just because

2:31:05.120 --> 2:31:06.400
 Boring

2:31:06.400 --> 2:31:10.080
 Is there some part of you that enjoys the I think that if I was like towards the end of my life

2:31:10.080 --> 2:31:14.400
 I would like to travel to mars because it'll be nice just die just for the experience. Yeah, but if I go to mars

2:31:14.400 --> 2:31:16.400
 I'm not coming back. I think that's it

2:31:17.120 --> 2:31:19.120
 one way ticket

2:31:19.200 --> 2:31:22.160
 May with the technology we have now maybe in the future maybe our

2:31:22.960 --> 2:31:30.560
 The children of our children will will be able to to experience that to go to the well the the weekend on mars

2:31:31.600 --> 2:31:37.040
 Uh, well the the whole design of the starship that spacex is working on is supposed to come back

2:31:37.040 --> 2:31:41.120
 Supposed to be reusable. So it's not it's not a one way ticket. That's the whole point

2:31:41.680 --> 2:31:46.560
 It's always going back and forth back and forth. What's the time frame between two planets?

2:31:47.120 --> 2:31:51.520
 Like to travel from I think the current thing you'd be stuck on mars for two years

2:31:52.080 --> 2:31:57.040
 But how long does it take to get from earth to mars? Oh, it's pretty I'm not exactly sure but it's pretty quick

2:31:57.840 --> 2:32:03.600
 It's pretty quick. Like, uh, I don't know and the scale of months not scale of years. You might not be healthy

2:32:03.600 --> 2:32:10.080
 When you come back, you know, all the astronauts they experience health issues, you know, they lose a lot of muscle mass bone density. So

2:32:10.720 --> 2:32:13.600
 Yeah, I don't think the technology is good right now. I mean

2:32:14.160 --> 2:32:19.120
 Let's say that it is I would love to be doing it for a weekend if it's safe

2:32:19.120 --> 2:32:24.720
 I would love to be the first one to do it for a professional fighter who sacrifices body for something

2:32:25.200 --> 2:32:30.560
 So there's some sacrifice we do in life, right? I don't want to be the first I wouldn't want to I least

2:32:30.560 --> 2:32:34.640
 The other one but when I know it's it's safe. Okay, count me in

2:32:34.640 --> 2:32:37.680
 So one of the things that people say and this is something I wonder about is

2:32:38.160 --> 2:32:43.680
 It's like having children or something once you see once you're out in space and you look out and you see earth

2:32:43.680 --> 2:32:48.720
 You look back at earth. That's an experience. It's not like anything else like you can't replicate it here

2:32:49.680 --> 2:32:52.720
 Um is to look back at that like blue dot

2:32:53.680 --> 2:32:55.680
 And that's nerve wracking

2:32:55.680 --> 2:33:00.800
 Like you see like earth disappear into the distance. Yeah. Yeah disappear

2:33:01.360 --> 2:33:04.320
 Into the distance and then you get to actually stand on mars and see

2:33:04.880 --> 2:33:07.920
 And just to look you're standing on the ground and you're looking out

2:33:08.480 --> 2:33:12.400
 And you see the planet from which you came and where you might not be coming back

2:33:12.800 --> 2:33:15.840
 But there's a challenge to the whole thing. Whereas the risk is tremendous

2:33:16.960 --> 2:33:22.000
 And I don't know I find that risk really compelling for some reason but that could be just

2:33:22.000 --> 2:33:26.080
 The exploration like I guess that's a genetic thing too. How much do you want to explore?

2:33:27.680 --> 2:33:34.080
 There's a sense though in which even in the best case scenario where they did get the technology to whisk you to mars and

2:33:34.800 --> 2:33:35.520
 in a

2:33:35.520 --> 2:33:37.520
 fairly short period of time

2:33:37.520 --> 2:33:41.360
 it's kind of an inauthentic sense of exploration because

2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:44.080
 your participation in it is

2:33:45.040 --> 2:33:47.280
 no more exciting than your

2:33:47.280 --> 2:33:51.680
 Participation in an airline flight to a foreign country. You're basically you

2:33:51.840 --> 2:33:57.040
 You didn't have anything to do with the creation of the of the vessel. You're not in command of the vessel. You're not

2:33:57.680 --> 2:34:00.080
 In any way shape or form important to the mission

2:34:00.560 --> 2:34:02.560
 You're just a person sitting in a passenger seat

2:34:02.800 --> 2:34:07.600
 And you get off in a destination the same way you would if you flew to singapore or london or someplace like that

2:34:07.920 --> 2:34:12.880
 Well, there's a hierarchy of there's a leadership and then there's a bunch of people that all have roles

2:34:12.880 --> 2:34:17.440
 There's a hierarchy of there's a leadership and then there's a bunch of people and they all have roles

2:34:17.520 --> 2:34:21.040
 You don't get to go to mars without having a skill set to contribute

2:34:21.520 --> 2:34:24.560
 You made it sound like space tourism where you just pay a ticket

2:34:24.480 --> 2:34:29.920
 I I don't I think it's a long time before you have space tourism to mars. We have nothing to contribute

2:34:30.880 --> 2:34:35.920
 Okay, like you will have to tell what you do you go through like a training program you go training program and then there's uh,

2:34:36.080 --> 2:34:38.800
 There's technical things you'll be contributing. So they would bring

2:34:39.360 --> 2:34:40.560
 people

2:34:40.560 --> 2:34:43.760
 You know in terms of agriculture, I don't know. Okay, so this is this is better

2:34:43.840 --> 2:34:48.080
 This sounds like they're actual they're more like explorers like if you talked before about

2:34:48.700 --> 2:34:50.700
 explorers and and human history where

2:34:51.040 --> 2:34:56.000
 Magellan sets off on his boat and every person on the boat had a specific function. They were they were all

2:34:56.960 --> 2:35:02.160
 Into the mission in a very authentic fashion if they weren't on the boat the performance of the crew would somehow suffer

2:35:02.560 --> 2:35:08.320
 So this sounds much better and just with like with Magellan. I think most of the crew died

2:35:08.320 --> 2:35:10.320
 A significant number did yeah

2:35:12.800 --> 2:35:20.240
 And from uh, yeah from bacteria, I mean from things that are unexpected and so on and if we discover life on mars

2:35:20.640 --> 2:35:24.960
 I mean, who knows what that entails because that's like a manned mission to mars

2:35:25.520 --> 2:35:29.520
 Would likely be very driven by the research to do all the kind of um

2:35:30.540 --> 2:35:36.480
 Exploration required to find life now from uh, mr. Musk's, uh

2:35:36.480 --> 2:35:41.840
 Uh point of view as a developer presumably there has to be some kind of financial incentive here, too

2:35:42.480 --> 2:35:43.680
 is there

2:35:43.680 --> 2:35:47.760
 some kind of financial benefit to mars missions is is

2:35:48.940 --> 2:35:50.400
 presumably

2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:51.360
 um

2:35:51.360 --> 2:35:57.360
 There wouldn't be that many people on earth that could afford a ticket to pay for the kind of research and development that would require

2:35:57.360 --> 2:36:01.440
 This is there some kind of mining on mars of minerals that would be useful

2:36:01.440 --> 2:36:06.640
 I think there's a lot of answers to this but the only honest answer is the one that looks back into human history

2:36:06.640 --> 2:36:09.520
 Where we did a lot of things just because we we could

2:36:10.240 --> 2:36:16.240
 A lot of hard things just because we could and that led to a lot of innovation that ultimately made our life better

2:36:16.640 --> 2:36:22.640
 So this is more this is why you have nasa. This is why you have government organizations. Like what's the purpose of nasa?

2:36:23.040 --> 2:36:25.600
 NASA would answer that by saying okay. Well, we're helping

2:36:25.600 --> 2:36:32.160
 We're helping launch satellites up there all that they'll have a bunch of answers, but the reality is the programs

2:36:33.200 --> 2:36:34.160
 were

2:36:34.160 --> 2:36:37.840
 funded in large part by our desire to explore the unknown

2:36:38.640 --> 2:36:43.840
 and um, there's some aspect to which we have to all invest into that because historically speaking

2:36:44.640 --> 2:36:48.180
 That has produced a lot of cool things along the way that were totally unexpected

2:36:48.640 --> 2:36:52.560
 Like uh, but nasa is funded by public funding the taxpayer

2:36:52.560 --> 2:36:57.040
 Uh, how is mr. Musk going to fund this? Well currently

2:36:57.840 --> 2:37:00.960
 most of the funding was the spacex is nasa giving

2:37:01.600 --> 2:37:02.640
 money

2:37:02.640 --> 2:37:04.400
 uh to

2:37:04.400 --> 2:37:09.600
 So they're making a competition who can who can get our satellites. We need to go to

2:37:10.400 --> 2:37:11.600
 um

2:37:11.600 --> 2:37:13.600
 you know for the space station to

2:37:14.240 --> 2:37:19.680
 Resupply the space station or we need to launch satellites up who's going to carry those quote unquote payloads

2:37:19.680 --> 2:37:22.880
 But they just need so nasa's paying whoever the heck wants to

2:37:23.440 --> 2:37:24.960
 uh get

2:37:24.960 --> 2:37:27.920
 kilograms of thing up into space

2:37:28.640 --> 2:37:32.240
 Why did this is nasa's specialty? Why did they just give up on that?

2:37:32.400 --> 2:37:40.000
 Well, they why they realized or mr. Musk came along and then bezos and others that said we could do it for one tenth the price

2:37:41.360 --> 2:37:46.240
 So why did the why should the taxpayers pay for the why don't you nasa do what you do well?

2:37:46.240 --> 2:37:50.320
 You know, which is like test out cutting edge stuff. Make sure they're safe

2:37:50.880 --> 2:37:52.080
 and now

2:37:52.080 --> 2:37:54.080
 That we've developed

2:37:54.080 --> 2:37:55.760
 um a car

2:37:55.760 --> 2:37:58.800
 Let us let us ups and fedex take care of

2:37:59.600 --> 2:38:03.360
 Doing this at scale doing it cheaper doing it better. I mean that's the argument

2:38:03.920 --> 2:38:07.680
 And nasa took what they realized is it took way way too long to do stuff

2:38:08.400 --> 2:38:12.080
 When you're investing millions if there's billions of dollars into a project

2:38:12.880 --> 2:38:13.760
 the

2:38:13.760 --> 2:38:15.760
 the bureaucracy builds up

2:38:15.760 --> 2:38:20.160
 And the conservatism builds up to where you're I mean you really have to test everything out

2:38:20.240 --> 2:38:25.360
 So projects take years and then you have somebody like ilan musk coming along and says well, let's do

2:38:25.920 --> 2:38:27.360
 launches every

2:38:27.360 --> 2:38:35.460
 Every week and as opposed to just throwing away the rocket. We'll reuse the rocket. That was one of the sort of cutting edge inventions

2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:38.000
 It's a dumb obvious idea

2:38:38.800 --> 2:38:44.160
 Like ilan says why do you throw away the play? It's the equivalent as if you flew a plane every time you threw it away

2:38:44.160 --> 2:38:46.480
 Why are we every time throwing away the plane?

2:38:46.480 --> 2:38:50.420
 But nasa's tried that kind of thing with the space shuttle since the 1970s

2:38:50.480 --> 2:38:57.440
 And yes, well, they did that with the space shuttle, but not not at the scale here that uh, it was the space shuttle was seen as this

2:38:58.160 --> 2:38:59.100
 like

2:38:59.100 --> 2:39:05.760
 Majestic amazing thing that requires a huge amount of investment with ilan musk is like no every basic rocket

2:39:06.320 --> 2:39:07.920
 Should be reusable

2:39:07.920 --> 2:39:11.280
 Nice cut cut cost cut cost. Do you do you think like?

2:39:11.280 --> 2:39:15.120
 Like the more technology we have the more advanced we become the more

2:39:15.740 --> 2:39:20.640
 Specialized we need to be like is that for that reason that now they they there's different branch

2:39:20.720 --> 2:39:25.760
 Like you just explained out now that so they're specialized in this but they left, you know other branch

2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:30.960
 Yeah, there's there's the greater and greater specializations. We build up more stuff, which is fascinating because

2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:34.000
 Is it making us?

2:39:34.160 --> 2:39:35.120
 more

2:39:35.120 --> 2:39:39.040
 Dumb in a way. Do you think like like like yeah, I don't know like

2:39:39.040 --> 2:39:44.480
 Like you you know, but I use a cell phone, but I don't know how to build it up from that

2:39:44.560 --> 2:39:47.600
 I mean, it's that beta males building up this whole society

2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:53.680
 um, because we're this collective intelligence we rely on each other more and more and

2:39:54.400 --> 2:39:55.360
 it

2:39:55.360 --> 2:39:58.960
 I do also see sort of the rise of conspiracy theories and all those kinds of things

2:39:59.440 --> 2:40:01.440
 because

2:40:01.840 --> 2:40:07.280
 Like i've been talking to a few folks about flat earth recently it's fascinating it's fascinating

2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:10.480
 there's a large community of people that believe the earth is flat and

2:40:11.520 --> 2:40:17.760
 That idea takes hold in this day and age of all the ideas. That's the one that takes hold for a large number of people

2:40:18.240 --> 2:40:19.680
 and

2:40:19.680 --> 2:40:24.560
 I think that's a consequence of this kind of specialization where it's just a huge amount of experts

2:40:25.120 --> 2:40:30.080
 But if you look out into our world and try to reason simply about our existence

2:40:30.400 --> 2:40:36.160
 We we are losing the skills to do that because more and more people are specialized as opposed to general thinkers

2:40:36.160 --> 2:40:41.600
 We're like extremely good at specific things. Are we capable now to do?

2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:44.400
 A robot that is self aware

2:40:45.360 --> 2:40:49.840
 That's that's one the legged one. I uh, it's self aware. It's not self aware

2:40:49.840 --> 2:40:56.640
 It's been listening, but it's not self aware. But do you think a human being is self aware or that's a good question

2:40:57.360 --> 2:41:01.440
 I mean I ask this question all the time when the robots move there's a sense of

2:41:03.840 --> 2:41:05.520
 When they turn on

2:41:05.520 --> 2:41:07.520
 Something entered that robot

2:41:07.840 --> 2:41:10.000
 Wow, and when it turns off something left

2:41:11.440 --> 2:41:18.560
 Uh if they move in a certain kind of way and if they're if they surprise you there's certain elements that enable us

2:41:19.600 --> 2:41:21.600
 to see the magic in

2:41:21.840 --> 2:41:26.960
 In a living being and some of them I mean we can care we can maybe list them

2:41:27.600 --> 2:41:30.720
 but it's the ability to surprise you it's the

2:41:30.720 --> 2:41:38.160
 The ability to make mistakes and learn from them visibly there's a bunch of things that you just

2:41:39.360 --> 2:41:41.120
 I don't know. It just feels

2:41:41.120 --> 2:41:43.680
 Like it has the magic of what is a living being

2:41:44.240 --> 2:41:49.840
 And which is what humans have and I try to think about how do you replicate that into a machine?

2:41:50.480 --> 2:41:55.360
 So when you turn it on enough you feel like it dies every time and he reborn

2:41:55.600 --> 2:41:59.440
 So for most machines, we don't feel that way. We don't when we unplug things

2:41:59.440 --> 2:42:06.240
 Things we don't feel that way. I don't know why we don't feel that way. That's an interesting question. But I think when

2:42:08.640 --> 2:42:10.660
 When the robot has certain qualities

2:42:11.920 --> 2:42:13.840
 like memory

2:42:13.840 --> 2:42:15.840
 Like ability to recognize you

2:42:16.880 --> 2:42:19.360
 Yeah, you start to feel like you're turning off an organism

2:42:19.920 --> 2:42:22.880
 So so whenever I have like the robots that recognize me

2:42:23.440 --> 2:42:28.480
 And remember this is important that all the things we've experienced together

2:42:28.480 --> 2:42:30.480
 Then it's like holy shit

2:42:30.560 --> 2:42:35.760
 That's a that's a living thing. But does he remember? It feels like a living thing. Does he remember

2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:42.800
 Your robot does he remember things that happened before you unplugged it? Is it like he's sleeping?

2:42:43.360 --> 2:42:49.600
 Like is he wake up or is he like that? So right now we start to zero everything. Uh, no, it doesn't start at zero

2:42:49.600 --> 2:42:54.400
 It remembers everything. That's the key. Every time you like you you unplug. Wow

2:42:54.400 --> 2:42:57.600
 It's storing the memory, but the memories are basic. They're like

2:42:57.600 --> 2:43:00.640
 they're like, okay, we walked around the kitchen and then

2:43:01.760 --> 2:43:08.160
 Um, you looked at me. I mean the memories it's like data. It's just it's not like we've experienced it's able to actually

2:43:08.800 --> 2:43:13.440
 Uh experience anything deep like we humans can but just the fact of memory

2:43:14.320 --> 2:43:18.880
 It's like the toaster or the microwave. Don't don't give a shit about me

2:43:19.520 --> 2:43:23.440
 They don't know me. They don't know me by name. They wouldn't recognize my face

2:43:23.440 --> 2:43:27.840
 As being different from gordon's they wouldn't know the difference and they wouldn't

2:43:28.460 --> 2:43:33.920
 Remember the microwave currently doesn't remember, you know, the times i've been sad or happy

2:43:34.480 --> 2:43:36.480
 Like what food I put into it

2:43:36.560 --> 2:43:41.280
 it doesn't remember this when I was being a fat ass or what I was being in good shape and

2:43:41.840 --> 2:43:46.160
 All just those memories are enough to make you feel when you turn a thing off

2:43:46.800 --> 2:43:48.800
 That's like shit

2:43:48.800 --> 2:43:54.640
 That's a living that's that that's a living thing disappearing. Of course, that's kind of an anthropomorphism we do to each other

2:43:55.760 --> 2:43:57.760
 But uh, that's something

2:43:58.160 --> 2:43:59.760
 You know that

2:43:59.760 --> 2:44:03.040
 That's something that makes me believe it's possible to create. Um

2:44:05.200 --> 2:44:11.040
 Systems with which we can have a connection that are nonhuman like similar to dogs and cats and so on

2:44:11.040 --> 2:44:18.180
 It just makes me and that's what's interesting to me because ultimately I feel like that'll help us understand ourselves

2:44:20.160 --> 2:44:23.440
 And maybe practice grappling moves anyway, um

2:44:26.720 --> 2:44:29.120
 Well, let me ask the uh advice question

2:44:29.760 --> 2:44:34.000
 Uh, now that we're together i've asked i've spoken to john. I spoke to george

2:44:34.720 --> 2:44:37.440
 What what advice would you give to young folks whether?

2:44:38.080 --> 2:44:39.680
 we're talking about

2:44:39.680 --> 2:44:46.800
 sport like excelling becoming great at grappling becoming great at fighting become a great at whatever sport they take on or

2:44:47.040 --> 2:44:50.400
 Life in general whether there may be in high school or in college

2:44:50.960 --> 2:44:54.160
 What advice would you give them to uh, excel?

2:44:55.200 --> 2:45:00.880
 At that thing they take on I don't know if i'm qualified to answer this because i'm only 26

2:45:01.200 --> 2:45:05.200
 So you're at the top you said giving advice to young people. Um

2:45:06.160 --> 2:45:08.160
 for me, I think the two biggest things are

2:45:08.160 --> 2:45:12.400
 Are find something that you're both talented in and you enjoy

2:45:12.880 --> 2:45:14.000
 um

2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:18.800
 I think that if you enjoy something, but you're terrible at it. It's going to be hard for you to be successful

2:45:19.520 --> 2:45:21.600
 In life at that given in that given area

2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:26.560
 Um, and it's going to be hard to do something for long amounts of time

2:45:27.120 --> 2:45:32.080
 Uh if you're talented at it, but you don't enjoy doing it. Um, it's easy to come in

2:45:32.800 --> 2:45:33.760
 and

2:45:33.760 --> 2:45:39.360
 train hard for a month or for two months or for a year, um, you can be very talented at it

2:45:39.680 --> 2:45:42.400
 But if you come in it's but it's a different story to come in

2:45:42.960 --> 2:45:47.360
 every day for five years in a row for 10 years in a row for 15 years in a row, um, so I think

2:45:48.720 --> 2:45:50.880
 I think finding something that you're both talented in

2:45:51.760 --> 2:45:55.040
 And something you enjoy are probably the two biggest things for me

2:45:55.520 --> 2:46:02.240
 How do you find the joy in it? So you've been training insane amount, you know a lot you've been doing it for a long time

2:46:02.240 --> 2:46:05.440
 Um, is there's is there ways to rediscover the joy in it?

2:46:06.080 --> 2:46:08.080
 Yeah for me initially

2:46:08.160 --> 2:46:10.880
 It was just learning new stuff, you know

2:46:11.120 --> 2:46:16.080
 You come in as a white belt and every day you learn you see a different move and you're like, oh man, it's that's awesome

2:46:16.640 --> 2:46:22.320
 um, and then when I started to compete more seriously towards my professional career it was

2:46:22.880 --> 2:46:28.480
 Uh the joy of doing camps and seeing the result of those camps and beating high level athletes

2:46:28.480 --> 2:46:33.040
 Um, and then it got to a point where i'd beaten all the high level athletes already. So

2:46:33.840 --> 2:46:37.680
 Who am I gonna compete against? Um, so now for me the joy is just

2:46:38.880 --> 2:46:39.920
 being

2:46:39.920 --> 2:46:47.040
 The best athlete I can possibly be until I reach my pride which i'm hoping is somewhere between 35 and 40

2:46:47.520 --> 2:46:50.000
 Um, so instead of competing against the other athletes

2:46:50.800 --> 2:46:53.440
 I'll be bored already because I already beat all the rest of the guys

2:46:53.920 --> 2:46:55.760
 um, but

2:46:55.760 --> 2:47:00.240
 I know that now I know that I can be better in a year from now or two years from now

2:47:00.400 --> 2:47:02.880
 Than I am today and that for me is exciting

2:47:04.240 --> 2:47:07.680
 By the way, is there some aspect of teaching that's exciting to you?

2:47:07.840 --> 2:47:14.240
 Yeah, I because you become a better and better teacher over the years. Yeah. Yeah, I definitely uh, I enjoy teaching and

2:47:15.360 --> 2:47:16.640
 I used to teach

2:47:16.640 --> 2:47:17.680
 um

2:47:17.680 --> 2:47:22.480
 A lot before I met john and then I met john and I was like, yeah, I just have no idea how to teach

2:47:22.480 --> 2:47:25.760
 Um, so that's like a completely different element, uh of the sport

2:47:26.160 --> 2:47:30.000
 Um, you know doing things and being good at doing things or being good at winning

2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:33.280
 uh and actually being able to communicate those skills and knowledge to

2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:37.120
 To a vast amount of people is two completely different things

2:47:38.320 --> 2:47:40.320
 George advice for young people

2:47:40.960 --> 2:47:42.800
 like yourself

2:47:42.800 --> 2:47:44.000
 well

2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:46.720
 First I was I would tell them find

2:47:47.440 --> 2:47:50.000
 What you want to become what you want to do?

2:47:50.800 --> 2:47:52.400
 and long term

2:47:52.400 --> 2:47:57.680
 Use certain things maybe sometimes you don't love but where you want to propel yourself in the future?

2:47:58.160 --> 2:48:03.120
 Not what your parent your your friend wants you to become what you you you want to become

2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:06.000
 So one once you find it

2:48:07.200 --> 2:48:08.320
 You cannot

2:48:08.320 --> 2:48:14.960
 Doing it by yourself everything that are that is big achievement in life. We cannot do it doing it by ourselves

2:48:14.960 --> 2:48:17.280
 so what I would say is second thing is

2:48:17.280 --> 2:48:21.920
 Try to build up your team and try to build up your team to be able to achieve your goal

2:48:23.440 --> 2:48:25.440
 Of people that are competent

2:48:25.920 --> 2:48:27.920
 And people that you trust

2:48:27.920 --> 2:48:29.920
 You need both competency and trust

2:48:30.560 --> 2:48:38.080
 I see a lot of people sometime in business. For example, they hire people they that are that they trust but they turns out to be incompetent

2:48:38.880 --> 2:48:43.600
 So now you have to fire a friend or otherwise your business going down the same problem

2:48:43.600 --> 2:48:48.720
 If you do the opposite you are you're someone that is competent, but you cannot trust is gonna is gonna screw you, you know

2:48:49.680 --> 2:48:54.880
 So it's very important to stay away from the negative build up your team people you trust and that are competent

2:48:56.080 --> 2:49:01.600
 And I would say the third one is to work to work hard to sacrifice yourself

2:49:01.600 --> 2:49:06.880
 Yeah, you have to go through hell sometime, but yeah, you have to see the light at the end of of it

2:49:06.880 --> 2:49:11.440
 You know to keep your dream in mind is going to give you the motivation to go through the tough time

2:49:11.440 --> 2:49:15.520
 It's nothing easy to go work work work. It's nothing you can accomplish without hard work

2:49:17.840 --> 2:49:19.840
 The fourth one I would say

2:49:19.840 --> 2:49:21.840
 To invest on yourself constantly

2:49:22.480 --> 2:49:28.640
 If you do not invest on yourself on whatever you are in which business and sport the game will catch up to you

2:49:29.360 --> 2:49:31.360
 For example, if you're if you become

2:49:32.080 --> 2:49:38.640
 Champion at something and if you stop improving the other guys that are trying to be champion, they're gonna catch up to you

2:49:38.640 --> 2:49:41.280
 So you need to invest on yourself and most people

2:49:42.080 --> 2:49:44.720
 Most athlete they make the mistake when they start to having money

2:49:45.600 --> 2:49:50.320
 They buy luxury stuff and that's one thing I didn't do when I start making money

2:49:50.320 --> 2:49:55.120
 I was investing of on traveling to new york trying with john gordon and the guys to learn

2:49:55.760 --> 2:50:01.040
 What is new in the the game of jiu jitsu? I used to go in thailand train muay thai

2:50:01.040 --> 2:50:07.200
 In las angeles to perfect my boxing skill

2:50:07.760 --> 2:50:14.480
 So instead of taking that money to buy me jewelry cars and to do what a lot of guys do because it's a mistake

2:50:15.360 --> 2:50:19.600
 I I invest it on myself because I know there were people coming they don't want my place

2:50:19.600 --> 2:50:21.600
 So I want I didn't want them to catch me

2:50:23.040 --> 2:50:26.720
 And the last one I would say it seems weird I would say

2:50:26.720 --> 2:50:33.840
 To give back and it's not because i'm a nice guy and it's not that I don't say that to look good. I say that

2:50:34.720 --> 2:50:36.720
 When you you make it

2:50:38.720 --> 2:50:42.240
 It creates opportunity where you can help certain group of people

2:50:43.520 --> 2:50:50.160
 But when I say give back not give back to everybody to anybody give back only to the the cause that you want

2:50:50.480 --> 2:50:51.840
 I give back

2:50:51.840 --> 2:50:54.320
 Not because i'm a nice guy. I'm kind of it's kind of selfish

2:50:54.320 --> 2:50:56.960
 I only give back to the people that I want to give back

2:50:57.680 --> 2:51:01.360
 Because I give back to them and I know that if i'm more successful

2:51:01.840 --> 2:51:06.640
 I'm going to be able to give back to people. I loved the cause that that that count for me

2:51:06.880 --> 2:51:10.720
 So it's it brings me more motivation because I don't compete

2:51:11.440 --> 2:51:15.040
 For myself anymore. I compete to help people. I love in a way

2:51:15.840 --> 2:51:22.560
 So when you you reach the top in your game, you need to find new motivation if you're satisfied is

2:51:22.560 --> 2:51:26.000
 The end of it your success will go down. So you need to

2:51:26.560 --> 2:51:30.160
 To find new motivation. What can motivate you? You know, what do you want?

2:51:30.160 --> 2:51:33.280
 Oh, I want to help this so I need to to be successful. I want to

2:51:34.000 --> 2:51:38.240
 You know, you need to find reason who what you want to do with your success

2:51:38.640 --> 2:51:44.160
 So when I say give back it's not because i'm not because i'm necessarily it's not to be to look like a nice guy

2:51:44.160 --> 2:51:46.160
 To keep your motivation

2:51:46.320 --> 2:51:47.840
 to be able to

2:51:47.840 --> 2:51:49.840
 Keep climbing the ladder even more

2:51:49.840 --> 2:51:52.320
 That's beautiful, george, uh, john

2:51:53.360 --> 2:52:00.240
 Um, first off the two responses given so far covered. I think the most important things already. Um,

2:52:01.040 --> 2:52:07.280
 Gordon talked about the the need for an underlying passion and enjoyment if you don't have that

2:52:07.920 --> 2:52:11.040
 You're not going to have the longevity that is required in order to build

2:52:12.080 --> 2:52:15.680
 Skills, which is ultimately everything's going to come down to your ability to build skills

2:52:15.680 --> 2:52:20.480
 You've got to have some kind of underlying passion and enjoyment which will keep you in the game long enough

2:52:21.040 --> 2:52:27.280
 To build world championship skills. It's going to take a minimum of five years and quite possibly considerably longer than that

2:52:28.160 --> 2:52:33.120
 Um, george talked about the idea of community. You're not going to make it by yourself

2:52:33.280 --> 2:52:37.840
 So you've got to be able to build people around you and uh, and build a trusting environment

2:52:38.400 --> 2:52:40.960
 Around you to develop those skills. Um,

2:52:40.960 --> 2:52:44.880
 What I would add to the the excellent points that both already raised

2:52:46.080 --> 2:52:50.420
 Alludes to what I said at the start of this podcast. You've got to be able to identify

2:52:51.200 --> 2:52:53.200
 some kind of undervalued

2:52:54.060 --> 2:52:58.800
 Elements in whatever industry you're in and show the world what their true value is

2:52:59.920 --> 2:53:01.600
 in addition

2:53:01.600 --> 2:53:03.600
 You can't go through life

2:53:04.240 --> 2:53:06.560
 Doing the same things as everybody else

2:53:06.560 --> 2:53:10.480
 Go through life doing the same things as everybody else

2:53:11.120 --> 2:53:13.120
 And expecting to get different results

2:53:13.520 --> 2:53:17.200
 This is straightforwardly irrational and worse. It's even arrogant

2:53:17.520 --> 2:53:23.040
 It's essentially the statement that i'm going to do the same thing as everyone else, but I believe i'm different

2:53:23.760 --> 2:53:25.760
 And so they'll work for me

2:53:25.840 --> 2:53:27.840
 But they didn't work for everyone else

2:53:27.920 --> 2:53:29.920
 That's like saying no i'm special

2:53:30.240 --> 2:53:33.200
 No, you're not special. We're all pretty much the same

2:53:33.200 --> 2:53:40.160
 And um in order to be special you're going to have to exhibit skills that other people simply don't have

2:53:40.960 --> 2:53:42.960
 um

2:53:42.960 --> 2:53:47.360
 Thirdly I would say if you want to become something truly impressive in life

2:53:47.840 --> 2:53:50.960
 You've got to be able to focus on one or two things

2:53:51.680 --> 2:53:54.080
 That you do better than anyone else in your industry

2:53:54.080 --> 2:54:01.200
 You can't learn everything but you can take one or two skills and the more innovative those skills are the better

2:54:01.920 --> 2:54:06.160
 And you can truly excel at them. For example at the peak of his career

2:54:06.960 --> 2:54:11.920
 No one in the world was better than george saint pierre at integrating striking and takedowns

2:54:12.640 --> 2:54:16.960
 No one in the world was better at integrating grappling and striking on the ground

2:54:17.600 --> 2:54:20.640
 He had two things that he could confidently say

2:54:20.640 --> 2:54:26.080
 He could confidently say he was the best in the world at was he the best at every mma skill? Nope

2:54:27.120 --> 2:54:28.460
 but he was

2:54:28.460 --> 2:54:34.080
 Absolutely the best at those two skills and those two skills were skills which he used throughout his career to win

2:54:34.560 --> 2:54:36.560
 the vast majority of his matches

2:54:36.880 --> 2:54:42.800
 Gordon ryan at the onset of his career could confidently say there's no one in the world better than me at leg locks

2:54:44.160 --> 2:54:48.020
 He could also say there's no one better in the world than me at late stage defense

2:54:48.020 --> 2:54:50.020
 to

2:54:50.260 --> 2:54:56.340
 Submission holds across the board as he went through his career. He started adding more and more elements

2:54:56.740 --> 2:55:02.820
 It's gotten to an extraordinary degree now where you could absolutely say he's the best at guard passing the best at guard retention

2:55:03.540 --> 2:55:06.260
 the list just keeps going on and that goes back to what

2:55:06.900 --> 2:55:08.100
 um

2:55:08.100 --> 2:55:14.820
 Gordon said earlier about keeping things interesting over time because we're always introducing new skill sets the day you start saying

2:55:14.820 --> 2:55:18.420
 I'm satisfied with my skill set is the day you get bored

2:55:19.060 --> 2:55:22.500
 and bored boredom to an athlete is a precursor to

2:55:24.020 --> 2:55:26.020
 Death by boredom

2:55:26.500 --> 2:55:29.780
 As long as you're still growing in those directions you'll stay in the game

2:55:30.500 --> 2:55:34.420
 For very long periods of time. So the main thing I would add to these

2:55:35.780 --> 2:55:39.140
 statements by gordon and george is this idea of

2:55:39.140 --> 2:55:44.260
 Of finding something which is currently undervalued and showing the world what its true value is

2:55:46.560 --> 2:55:47.860
 Understanding

2:55:47.860 --> 2:55:55.220
 That you can't just use the same training methodologies as everyone else and somehow expect to be different from everyone else. You've got to

2:55:55.860 --> 2:56:01.140
 Almost every great rise in human civilization whether it be groups of people or individuals

2:56:01.540 --> 2:56:05.780
 Required some kind of innovation. You've got to look for that new angle

2:56:05.780 --> 2:56:09.060
 Okay, george st. Pierre found it with shoe boxing early on in his career

2:56:09.940 --> 2:56:15.220
 Gordon ryan found it with leg locks early on in his career and they branched out from that from that angle

2:56:18.100 --> 2:56:24.660
 Add to this the idea that you want to become the absolute best in the world in your industry

2:56:24.980 --> 2:56:27.300
 In one or two things that make a difference

2:56:27.940 --> 2:56:32.100
 Find out what they are and focus on those things and you'll go far

2:56:32.100 --> 2:56:34.100
 John

2:56:34.660 --> 2:56:38.740
 Gordon george, this is an incredible conversation. Thank you so much for your

2:56:39.220 --> 2:56:43.700
 Extremely valuable time george as somebody who's become famous in part

2:56:44.660 --> 2:56:46.660
 By commenting on people's performance

2:56:47.540 --> 2:56:50.020
 Um, how do you think we did?

2:56:51.060 --> 2:56:53.460
 How would you evaluate our performance today?

2:56:54.500 --> 2:56:56.500
 I'm not impressed by

2:56:56.500 --> 2:57:01.780
 Yeah, thank you. I loved it. I learned all the time. I've talked to you guys. I'm

2:57:02.500 --> 2:57:04.500
 It's it's great. I loved it

2:57:04.660 --> 2:57:10.660
 I was very stimulated. I and really enjoyed it. Yeah, it's uh, it was it was something

2:57:10.660 --> 2:57:13.220
 I really was looking forward to I was hoping that would get together

2:57:14.020 --> 2:57:17.060
 It's so rare that at the same time in history

2:57:17.140 --> 2:57:21.540
 There will be some of the greats together and the fact that you guys would be willing to come together and talk like this

2:57:21.540 --> 2:57:26.420
 This is awesome. And that gordon he would even wear a cowboy hat. I mean, this is just historic

2:57:26.660 --> 2:57:30.580
 This is like church. You're all getting together with whoever, you know, this is great and all

2:57:30.580 --> 2:57:37.060
 But the next one is just going to be us just quizzing john on which animals would win in fights. Yes for the whole three hours

2:57:37.060 --> 2:57:41.860
 It'll be just so we'll invite joe and you'll just be we'll we'll make it a systematic

2:57:41.860 --> 2:57:47.620
 It'll be a debate between joe and john on which animal would win. John and I we have a thing that we send each other

2:57:47.620 --> 2:57:54.520
 Footage all the time of animal fight where we are, uh, very intrigue about animal fight

2:57:57.220 --> 2:58:00.500
 I get them like 3 30 am on it. He's like check this out

2:58:01.060 --> 2:58:03.620
 Like a rhino taking a like a pig like

2:58:05.140 --> 2:58:11.780
 Literally, it's not always fair. No, no, it's not ever but interesting stuff if you people would see what we send

2:58:12.100 --> 2:58:15.220
 The stuff that we they would judge you harshly. Yeah

2:58:15.220 --> 2:58:19.380
 Harshly. Yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. Thanks so much guys. This is awesome

2:58:20.500 --> 2:58:27.860
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with george saint pierre john donahue and gordon ryan to support this podcast

2:58:27.860 --> 2:58:29.880
 Please check out our sponsors in the description

2:58:30.740 --> 2:58:34.360
 And now let me leave you some words from miyamoto musashi

2:58:35.700 --> 2:58:43.220
 There's nothing outside yourself that can ever enable you to get better stronger richer quicker or smarter

2:58:43.220 --> 2:58:46.200
 Everything is within everything exists

2:58:46.820 --> 2:58:48.820
 Seek nothing outside of yourself

2:58:48.820 --> 2:59:12.820
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
