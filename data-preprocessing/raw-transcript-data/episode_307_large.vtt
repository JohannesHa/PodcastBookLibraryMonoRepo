00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
 The following is a conversation with Brian Armstrong,

00:02.560 --> 00:05.240
 cofounder and CEO of Coinbase,

00:05.240 --> 00:07.800
 the largest cryptocurrency exchange platform

00:07.800 --> 00:11.360
 with 98 million users in 100 countries,

00:11.360 --> 00:13.880
 listing Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano,

00:13.880 --> 00:17.320
 and over 100 popular cryptocurrencies.

00:17.320 --> 00:19.280
 I recorded this conversation with Brian

00:19.280 --> 00:21.880
 before this week's SEC probe

00:21.880 --> 00:25.440
 into whether some of the crypto listings are securities

00:25.440 --> 00:27.880
 and thus need to be regulated as such.

00:27.880 --> 00:31.240
 As always, with conversations that involve cryptocurrency,

00:31.240 --> 00:33.000
 I try to make it timeless

00:33.000 --> 00:37.200
 so that the price soaring high or crashing down low

00:37.200 --> 00:40.520
 doesn't distract from the fundamental technological,

00:40.520 --> 00:42.720
 economic, social, and philosophical ideas

00:42.720 --> 00:47.720
 underlying this new form of money, energy, and information.

00:47.760 --> 00:52.400
 Our world runs on money, the exchange and store of value,

00:52.400 --> 00:55.360
 and cryptocurrency seeks to build the next chapter

00:55.360 --> 00:58.680
 of how money works and what it can do.

00:58.680 --> 01:01.280
 Coinbase and Brian are trying to do this

01:01.280 --> 01:04.280
 by working together with regulators and governments,

01:04.280 --> 01:06.760
 which is a long and difficult road.

01:06.760 --> 01:11.240
 Bureaucracies resist change, for better and for worse.

01:11.240 --> 01:14.680
 The latest SEC probe is a good representation of this.

01:14.680 --> 01:17.480
 It is a serious attempt to limit fraud,

01:17.480 --> 01:20.960
 but one that also runs the risk of limiting innovation

01:20.960 --> 01:24.440
 and limiting financial freedom of individuals.

01:24.440 --> 01:26.040
 This is a complicated mess,

01:26.040 --> 01:27.480
 and I applaud everyone involved

01:27.480 --> 01:29.400
 for trying to work through it.

01:29.400 --> 01:33.120
 I hope in the end, the interest of the individual wins.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.880
 Decentralization, after all, is a hedge

01:35.880 --> 01:39.320
 against the corrupting nature of centralized power.

01:39.320 --> 01:41.320
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.520
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:43.520 --> 01:44.760
 in the description.

01:44.760 --> 01:48.280
 And now, dear friends, here's Brian Armstrong.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.680
 Let's start with the fact that you're a programmer.

01:51.680 --> 01:53.960
 What was the first program you've ever written?

01:53.960 --> 01:55.920
 Or the first one that you remember?

01:55.920 --> 01:57.720
 The first memory I have of programming

01:57.720 --> 01:59.320
 was probably in middle school.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.800
 And I remember it was recess,

02:01.800 --> 02:04.800
 and they had this time period where you could read books,

02:04.800 --> 02:07.240
 and the other kids were reading comic books and stuff.

02:07.240 --> 02:10.240
 And for some reason, I had gotten into this idea

02:10.240 --> 02:11.560
 that I wanted to get into computers,

02:11.560 --> 02:13.920
 and I was playing with computers at home.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.880
 And so I got this book, I think from the library,

02:15.880 --> 02:19.520
 it was called How to Learn Java in 30 Days.

02:19.520 --> 02:24.000
 So I was reading this book at the recess,

02:24.000 --> 02:25.680
 and I didn't understand anything.

02:25.680 --> 02:26.960
 And I remember I went home,

02:26.960 --> 02:29.600
 and I tried to get this thing working.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.840
 And if you've ever written a Java program,

02:31.840 --> 02:35.040
 the first lines are public static void main string args

02:35.040 --> 02:35.880
 or whatever.

02:35.880 --> 02:39.400
 And it's so foreign, and it's so difficult to get started.

02:39.400 --> 02:40.520
 And so I was kind of frustrated.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.840
 I was like, I don't understand anything

02:41.840 --> 02:43.280
 that's happening in this book.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.960
 So the first thing I wrote was probably just

02:45.960 --> 02:48.240
 a Hello World app in Java.

02:48.240 --> 02:51.640
 But I felt like I was so confused

02:51.640 --> 02:52.840
 about what was actually happening

02:52.840 --> 02:55.800
 that I later learned a bit of PHP.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.680
 And PHP was like more fun for me

02:57.680 --> 03:00.400
 because it was like, oh, just print out what you want.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.080
 It didn't have all this complexity around it.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.320
 So then I got more into PHP,

03:04.320 --> 03:06.880
 I started building like some simple websites,

03:06.880 --> 03:09.240
 I think learned some HTML.

03:09.240 --> 03:12.120
 So I think that was my introduction to programming,

03:12.120 --> 03:13.320
 at least the very beginning part.

03:13.320 --> 03:18.320
 Yeah, you know, Java has a lot of,

03:18.440 --> 03:20.640
 out of all the Hello Worlds it could possibly write,

03:20.640 --> 03:23.160
 Java is the one where I think it's the longest.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.160
 Yeah.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.080
 Which is quite interesting

03:25.080 --> 03:27.080
 because Java is often at least for a long time

03:27.080 --> 03:29.160
 was used as the primary programming language

03:29.160 --> 03:30.800
 to teach people how to program,

03:30.800 --> 03:32.680
 or at least about object oriented programming.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.280
 I think most universities have now switched

03:35.280 --> 03:37.360
 and high school switched to Python.

03:37.360 --> 03:38.800
 I'm not sure if that's the case.

03:38.800 --> 03:39.640
 Probably better.

03:39.640 --> 03:40.480
 It's easier to learn.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.200
 It lowers the, it makes it less scary.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.520
 It was like less of a hurdle.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.320
 And certainly none of them use PHP.

03:45.320 --> 03:48.400
 I love PHP and I feel like it's a dirty secret.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.000
 I have to keep private to myself.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.600
 Like it's somebody I'm seeing on the side

03:52.600 --> 03:53.440
 or something like that,

03:53.440 --> 03:56.320
 because it's just not a respected programming language

03:56.320 --> 03:57.880
 because I think there's so many ways

03:57.880 --> 04:00.720
 you can write poor code with PHP,

04:00.720 --> 04:02.080
 which is why it's not respected.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.960
 Yeah, it's a scripting language more so,

04:03.960 --> 04:06.280
 although of course Facebook built like a huge stack

04:06.280 --> 04:07.640
 on top of an invaluable company,

04:07.640 --> 04:10.200
 but I still love Ruby to this day.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.320
 Ruby is probably my favorite language.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.160
 Python's great too,

04:13.160 --> 04:16.280
 but I just love the idea behind Ruby that it's like,

04:16.280 --> 04:18.160
 let's make it easier for the human,

04:18.160 --> 04:19.480
 harder for the computer,

04:19.480 --> 04:22.560
 and make it a joy to be expressive and all these things.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.920
 So I was never the best computer scientist,

04:24.920 --> 04:26.200
 but I was a good hacker.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.200
 I could rapidly prototype products

04:28.200 --> 04:30.480
 and using languages like Ruby.

04:30.480 --> 04:33.800
 Do a lot of computer science programs still use like Lisp

04:33.800 --> 04:35.240
 and Scheme and things like that?

04:35.240 --> 04:39.080
 No, they do for, that's like, that's if you're hardcore.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.520
 If you're legit, you're gonna do

04:40.520 --> 04:42.280
 some of the functional languages.

04:42.280 --> 04:44.920
 I think there's a few others that popped up,

04:44.920 --> 04:48.600
 but Lisp is a distant memory for a lot of people.

04:48.600 --> 04:49.960
 That's like somebody has to like,

04:49.960 --> 04:53.600
 you go to library, you dust off the book,

04:53.600 --> 04:55.760
 but Scheme a little bit.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.240
 I think if you're starting,

04:57.240 --> 04:59.440
 I mean, there's courses about languages themselves,

04:59.440 --> 05:01.560
 like programming languages.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.160
 Lisp might be one of those,

05:03.160 --> 05:05.480
 you know how there's languages that nobody uses anymore,

05:05.480 --> 05:06.800
 like ancient languages?

05:06.800 --> 05:09.160
 You might have to go to school in that same way

05:09.160 --> 05:10.640
 for programming languages.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.840
 Back in the day, we used to use parentheses.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.840
 I of course still use Emacs as the editor

05:15.840 --> 05:17.440
 for most things that I do.

05:17.440 --> 05:22.040
 And Emacs is, a lot of the customization you can do

05:22.040 --> 05:24.960
 is in Lisp and that's the language probably

05:24.960 --> 05:29.960
 when I first really fell in love with programming is Lisp.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.440
 Because for a long time throughout the earlier history

05:34.440 --> 05:35.520
 of artificial intelligence,

05:35.520 --> 05:36.800
 Lisp was the primary language,

05:36.800 --> 05:41.520
 but it still had a life in the 90s and the aughts

05:41.520 --> 05:43.240
 where some people would use it.

05:43.240 --> 05:46.480
 It's such a beautiful functional language,

05:46.480 --> 05:48.280
 but it just somehow didn't pick up.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.480
 That said, I should say sort of push back,

05:53.480 --> 05:55.840
 PHP, I feel like it's still true

05:55.840 --> 05:58.880
 that most of the web runs on PHP.

05:58.880 --> 06:02.200
 Most of the backend is still PHP.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.760
 So if you look at, you know,

06:03.760 --> 06:05.720
 it's like the stuff that people don't talk about.

06:05.720 --> 06:08.520
 It's like what runs most systems in the world?

06:08.520 --> 06:11.080
 What runs the most backend?

06:11.080 --> 06:12.960
 What runs most front end?

06:12.960 --> 06:15.840
 JavaScript, you know, HTML.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.640
 The Stack Exchange surveys show JavaScript

06:18.640 --> 06:20.360
 is the most popular language in the world, I think, right?

06:20.360 --> 06:23.620
 Oh yeah, in terms of programmers and numbers of, I wonder.

06:25.480 --> 06:28.920
 By survey of number of programmers on Stack Overflow.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.400
 Oh yeah, but that's also the cutting edge, right?

06:31.400 --> 06:33.880
 Those are the people that are just like excitedly

06:33.880 --> 06:34.840
 writing code.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.480
 I wonder if there's people that are just like

06:37.480 --> 06:40.280
 maintaining gigantic code bases.

06:40.280 --> 06:43.520
 Yeah, I feel like the amount of Java out there

06:43.520 --> 06:46.680
 just running industrial systems has gotta be enormous.

06:46.680 --> 06:49.280
 And then of course in the banking industry, finance,

06:49.280 --> 06:52.760
 it's like even older stuff, Cobalt and whatnot, but.

06:52.760 --> 06:57.400
 I've been actually looking for somebody to interview

06:57.400 --> 07:00.840
 who represents Cobalt and Fortran.

07:00.840 --> 07:05.320
 Like who's the figure still there that holds the flag?

07:05.320 --> 07:07.640
 I did, you know, with Java, founder of Java,

07:07.640 --> 07:11.360
 creator of Java, creator of Python, creator of C++,

07:11.360 --> 07:14.360
 but nobody wants to hold the flag for Cobalt and Fortran,

07:14.360 --> 07:17.920
 even though some of the most important systems in the world

07:17.920 --> 07:20.120
 still run on those.

07:20.120 --> 07:23.480
 Like power systems and infrastructure systems,

07:23.480 --> 07:27.080
 which is fascinating, and ATMs and stuff like that.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.440
 Like a lot of stuff that we rely on,

07:30.440 --> 07:32.400
 it just works, and the reason we don't change it

07:32.400 --> 07:33.920
 is because it works well.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.920
 It was written in languages that people don't use anymore.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.600
 Yeah, that'd be a cool series of interviews.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.440
 Get the stuff that's like tech that was invented

07:42.440 --> 07:45.320
 40, 50 years ago, but still is being used widely.

07:45.320 --> 07:47.120
 I mean Emacs is an example of that.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.160
 Let me ask the big question of

07:50.800 --> 07:54.000
 what are cryptocurrency exchanges and what's Coinbase?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.040
 How does it work?

07:55.040 --> 07:57.440
 Before, I'll ask even bigger questions,

07:57.440 --> 08:00.800
 but it's just a nice kind of palate cleansing question

08:00.800 --> 08:02.040
 of what is Coinbase?

08:03.000 --> 08:07.600
 Coinbase is a cryptocurrency exchange brokerage custodian.

08:07.600 --> 08:11.080
 Basically, we're the primary financial account for people

08:11.080 --> 08:13.720
 in the crypto economy, how they buy crypto,

08:13.720 --> 08:15.520
 how they store it, how they use it increasingly

08:15.520 --> 08:16.360
 in different ways.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.320
 We can talk about that.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.840
 So yeah, we want to be the way that a billion people

08:20.840 --> 08:23.840
 hopefully access the open financial system globally.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.000
 How does it work?

08:25.000 --> 08:28.720
 What's cryptocurrency?

08:29.640 --> 08:33.440
 There's Bitcoin, there's Ethereum.

08:34.800 --> 08:37.360
 What does it mean to be an exchange?

08:37.360 --> 08:39.000
 What does it mean to store?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.560
 What does it mean to transact?

08:40.560 --> 08:43.640
 How does it, what does Coinbase actually do?

08:43.640 --> 08:46.680
 Okay, so basically in any given market,

08:46.680 --> 08:47.880
 there's some people who want to buy,

08:47.880 --> 08:49.360
 some people who want to sell,

08:49.360 --> 08:53.280
 and you keep an order book of all those prices.

08:53.280 --> 08:56.920
 And then if someone's willing to buy

08:56.920 --> 08:59.800
 for more than the lowest price someone's willing to sell,

08:59.800 --> 09:02.120
 then you get a trade to execute.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.440
 That's kind of how an exchange works underneath.

09:04.440 --> 09:06.800
 And a brokerage is kind of simpler than that even.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.000
 You don't have to know,

09:08.000 --> 09:09.440
 look at the whole order book and everything,

09:09.440 --> 09:10.600
 but you just go in there and you say,

09:10.600 --> 09:12.360
 I want to buy a hundred dollars of Bitcoin

09:12.360 --> 09:14.000
 or whatever cryptocurrency.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.200
 You get a quote, and if you like it, you can hit accept.

09:16.200 --> 09:19.480
 And the core things that we do to make all that

09:19.480 --> 09:21.480
 kind of just work, make it seamless,

09:21.480 --> 09:23.040
 it sounds simple on the surface,

09:23.040 --> 09:26.160
 is we have to do payment integrations

09:26.160 --> 09:27.520
 in a variety of places around the world

09:27.520 --> 09:29.560
 to make it easy for people to get fiat currency

09:29.560 --> 09:31.720
 into this ecosystem.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.720
 We have to do work on cybersecurity a lot.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.160
 There's lots of hackers out there

09:35.160 --> 09:37.080
 trying to break into our systems and steal crypto

09:37.080 --> 09:39.880
 or to put stolen credit cards and bank accounts

09:39.880 --> 09:41.880
 and things like that into these systems.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.480
 We have to integrate with the blockchains themselves,

09:45.480 --> 09:48.400
 which are periodically getting updated

09:48.400 --> 09:51.320
 and having various airdrops and all kinds of things.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.520
 So we're integrated with lots of different blockchains.

09:53.520 --> 09:54.560
 And then we have to store the crypto

09:54.560 --> 09:57.040
 that people buy securely as well.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.400
 So crypto is kind of like storing,

09:59.400 --> 10:00.920
 you store the private keys essentially.

10:00.920 --> 10:03.040
 And we've invented a lot of cool technology

10:03.040 --> 10:04.800
 about how to do that securely

10:04.800 --> 10:06.960
 that helps me sleep at night

10:06.960 --> 10:09.480
 as one of the largest crypto custodians out there.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.400
 So those are some of the pieces that had to come together

10:12.400 --> 10:16.360
 to get that early simple buy sell experience to work.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.640
 And yeah, I mean, Coinbase actually has

10:18.640 --> 10:20.000
 a lot of different products now.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.880
 So we have like an institutional product.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.280
 We have Coinbase Commerce,

10:23.280 --> 10:26.120
 which is like merchant payments, like Stripe for crypto.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.960
 We've got a self custodial wallet,

10:27.960 --> 10:28.800
 which we can talk about.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.320
 There's all kinds of cool applications

10:30.320 --> 10:31.560
 people are building with web3

10:31.560 --> 10:32.680
 and they can access it through that.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.000
 We just launched an NFT product.

10:36.280 --> 10:37.640
 I can go on down the list.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.680
 So we're sort of like a portfolio of crypto products now.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.000
 We're big enough where we can do multiple things.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.920
 But yeah, the core thing we got started with

10:43.920 --> 10:45.520
 and still the majority of our revenue today

10:45.520 --> 10:48.680
 is people just wanna come in and buy and sell some crypto.

10:48.680 --> 10:49.960
 And we help them do that and make it simple

10:49.960 --> 10:51.000
 and easy to use.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.880
 And I'll ask you about wallet, NFT is about,

10:53.880 --> 10:54.720
 what is it called?

10:54.720 --> 10:55.680
 The Stripe type?

10:55.680 --> 10:56.720
 Coinbase Commerce.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.040
 Coinbase Commerce.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.160
 I'll ask you about all that.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.320
 But order books in exchange,

11:01.320 --> 11:04.840
 what's the difference between that and stocks, for example,

11:04.840 --> 11:06.520
 which there's also order books.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.560
 Yes, I mean, stocks trade through order books too.

11:08.560 --> 11:09.600
 So do commodities.

11:09.600 --> 11:12.000
 There's all similar type of situation.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.640
 So when I wanna buy one Bitcoin and I see Coinbase,

11:15.640 --> 11:20.520
 say the price of that Bitcoin is say $40,000

11:20.520 --> 11:23.560
 and I press buy, what happens?

11:25.400 --> 11:26.240
 Yeah, okay.

11:26.240 --> 11:27.160
 So you've gotten a lot,

11:29.520 --> 11:30.960
 when you press the button on your keyboard,

11:30.960 --> 11:32.880
 like an electrical signal goes up the wire

11:32.880 --> 11:33.720
 on your keyboard.

11:33.720 --> 11:35.040
 No, we won't cut out the level.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.720
 That's also important, the timing, right?

11:36.720 --> 11:38.760
 Cause it's not price fixed.

11:38.760 --> 11:39.600
 Yeah, that's true.

11:39.600 --> 11:40.880
 It's giving you a quote, right?

11:42.880 --> 11:44.520
 There's a whole concept of like slippage.

11:44.520 --> 11:47.320
 And like by the time the quote is executed,

11:48.240 --> 11:50.760
 if the price has moved too much, like we may reject it.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.920
 And there's various things like that.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.040
 But how do, I mean, what's the simple version I can give you?

11:55.040 --> 11:59.080
 So we'll basically check the order book, give you a quote.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.560
 It's good for some period of time

12:00.560 --> 12:02.480
 or for some amount of slippage.

12:02.480 --> 12:06.200
 And then what's happening is we're initiating a debit

12:06.200 --> 12:08.120
 to your payment method, whether that's a credit card

12:08.120 --> 12:11.240
 or a bank account, or you're storing dollars or euros

12:11.240 --> 12:12.440
 or something on our platform,

12:12.440 --> 12:13.800
 there's various payment methods.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.560
 So we're basically debiting that.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.520
 And then we're crediting you the crypto

12:17.520 --> 12:19.640
 and we're taking a fee for it too.

12:19.640 --> 12:24.160
 So that's fundamentally what's happening underneath.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.120
 And then there's just some interesting slippage.

12:26.120 --> 12:30.640
 How do you calculate how much slippage is allowed?

12:30.640 --> 12:33.280
 Like how do you know these things?

12:33.280 --> 12:35.200
 Cause order books are fascinating.

12:36.680 --> 12:39.360
 The dynamics of that is pretty interesting.

12:39.360 --> 12:40.720
 The little I know about it.

12:40.720 --> 12:43.720
 Yeah, so there's a lot of people like traders

12:43.720 --> 12:46.080
 who get super into this and like high frequency traders

12:46.080 --> 12:48.320
 and arbitrage and all kinds of interesting topics.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.880
 Flash Boys was like an interesting book

12:49.880 --> 12:50.840
 on this whole thing.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.840
 You want like access to information the fastest,

12:53.840 --> 12:56.800
 sometimes even putting your thing in the data center

12:56.800 --> 12:58.160
 right next to the thing.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.440
 We don't allow that colo stuff

12:59.440 --> 13:01.480
 cause we want it to be more democratized.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.240
 But basically you give a,

13:05.240 --> 13:07.080
 let's say we wanted to just keep it math simple.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.640
 We want to charge a 1% fee.

13:08.640 --> 13:11.120
 So if you're buying $100 of Bitcoin

13:11.120 --> 13:13.400
 and we'll charge you $101,

13:13.400 --> 13:14.840
 we've presented you the amount of Bitcoin

13:14.840 --> 13:16.280
 you're going to get for the $100.

13:16.280 --> 13:18.720
 Now let's say 10 seconds later you hit accept.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.000
 We go to fill the order.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.560
 So it's going to be some error bound

13:23.560 --> 13:25.400
 around that 1% fee, right?

13:25.400 --> 13:27.520
 And if we think we're actually losing money on the trade,

13:27.520 --> 13:29.520
 I think we'll often reject it.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.960
 So some part of the fee,

13:31.960 --> 13:35.000
 the slippage is incorporated into that,

13:35.000 --> 13:38.240
 averaged over a large number of people.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.680
 Just, it's fascinating.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.560
 Cause like even just like that little detail

13:41.560 --> 13:44.240
 probably requires a lot of experimentation.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.080
 Yeah.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.960
 And it's kind of like a giant bug bounty out there

13:46.960 --> 13:48.480
 because if you get it wrong,

13:48.480 --> 13:50.040
 there's people who are going to arbitrage that.

13:50.040 --> 13:53.600
 And we've had people sort of pen test our systems

13:53.600 --> 13:55.840
 in a really creative ways where like,

13:58.000 --> 14:01.280
 they'll just fire like programmatically with APIs,

14:01.280 --> 14:03.560
 they'll fire off like a million different quotes

14:03.560 --> 14:05.320
 and look for one of them that's out of bounds

14:05.320 --> 14:07.200
 and then actually take that money right there.

14:07.200 --> 14:10.360
 And we get people doing all kinds of crazy stuff.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.320
 So how do you protect against that?

14:12.320 --> 14:13.400
 How do you protect?

14:13.400 --> 14:15.880
 So we'll talk about cybersecurity in interesting ways,

14:15.880 --> 14:18.240
 but there's a lot of clever people

14:18.240 --> 14:20.960
 trying to do clever things to earn,

14:20.960 --> 14:22.640
 not even just to break into the system,

14:22.640 --> 14:26.280
 but to earn an edge of some kind in the system.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.840
 How do you stay one step ahead?

14:28.840 --> 14:29.680
 There's no silver bullet,

14:29.680 --> 14:30.840
 it's a bunch of lead bullets, right?

14:30.840 --> 14:34.680
 So it's like, you know, one thing we do is

14:34.680 --> 14:36.200
 we just have good test suites, right?

14:36.200 --> 14:38.440
 So you're testing every piece of code that goes out,

14:38.440 --> 14:40.180
 that's like just common good best practice,

14:40.180 --> 14:42.920
 but it's particularly important in financial services.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.960
 Another thing we do is we hire third party firms

14:45.960 --> 14:48.040
 to try to audit this stuff and break in.

14:48.040 --> 14:51.280
 Another one we do is we have a bug bounty program.

14:51.280 --> 14:55.480
 So we basically pay white hat hackers to find this stuff

14:55.480 --> 14:56.800
 before the black hats do.

14:56.800 --> 14:59.800
 And we've paid out lots of good bug bounties.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.780
 So, you know, try all the above.

15:02.780 --> 15:03.840
 And occasionally you don't get it right

15:03.840 --> 15:05.440
 and you lose some money and then you fix it

15:05.440 --> 15:07.400
 and you keep going, so yeah.

15:07.400 --> 15:10.360
 Let's talk about cybersecurity a little bit more.

15:10.360 --> 15:13.200
 You mentioned using stolen bank accounts.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.200
 So that's another one, that's another interesting one.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.480
 How do you protect against that?

15:17.480 --> 15:20.720
 Okay, so fraud prevention, yeah, is a big topic.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.120
 So one of the, there's a lot of things people do,

15:23.120 --> 15:25.200
 but one of the things they do

15:25.200 --> 15:28.200
 is that you use machine learning, right?

15:28.200 --> 15:29.800
 So you look at hundreds.

15:29.800 --> 15:30.920
 To protect or to attack?

15:30.920 --> 15:32.400
 To protect against it.

15:32.400 --> 15:35.620
 So what you want to do is kind of build up

15:35.620 --> 15:39.000
 a labeled data set of all the different people

15:39.000 --> 15:42.720
 who have turned out to be fraudulent and good actors,

15:42.720 --> 15:44.240
 and hopefully collect as much data as you can.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.800
 And then, you know, you might feed hundreds

15:45.800 --> 15:47.720
 or thousands of these factors

15:47.720 --> 15:49.480
 into your machine learning model

15:49.480 --> 15:51.600
 and it'll come back with a risk score.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.720
 So, you know, an example of like the kinds of factors

15:54.720 --> 15:56.460
 people create or put in there, you know,

15:56.460 --> 15:57.880
 obviously I don't want to disclose too many of them

15:57.880 --> 15:59.740
 because it's a cat and mouse game,

15:59.740 --> 16:01.360
 but just kind of, I don't know,

16:01.360 --> 16:03.300
 relatively well known stuff might be.

16:03.300 --> 16:06.900
 You know, you have device fingerprints, right?

16:06.900 --> 16:08.860
 So like, what kind of device are you on

16:08.860 --> 16:10.380
 and what fonts do you have installed?

16:10.380 --> 16:12.300
 A lot of people who are farming lots of these accounts,

16:12.300 --> 16:15.220
 they're using emulators and like virtual machines and stuff.

16:15.220 --> 16:16.460
 They're not like, you know,

16:16.460 --> 16:18.160
 an average person on that device.

16:19.160 --> 16:21.160
 And then you'll see sometimes like,

16:21.160 --> 16:23.260
 one of my favorite metrics we track for this

16:23.260 --> 16:26.120
 was called like improbable travel velocity.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.480
 So we would, we're tracking people's IPS, right?

16:28.480 --> 16:33.340
 And you might see someone who was one day in Austin, Texas

16:33.340 --> 16:36.140
 and then like an hour later they were in London or something.

16:36.140 --> 16:37.560
 It's like, well, that's very improbable.

16:37.560 --> 16:39.500
 I mean, sometimes people are using VPNs.

16:39.500 --> 16:40.500
 So you gotta be careful with that

16:40.500 --> 16:42.780
 because like there's legitimate people who use VPNs too.

16:42.780 --> 16:46.700
 But if it's not possible for them to have gotten on a plane

16:46.700 --> 16:47.620
 and gotten there that quickly,

16:47.620 --> 16:50.260
 then that's usually they're like spoofing a device or IP.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.540
 Sometimes those are interesting factors.

16:52.540 --> 16:56.100
 But yeah, if you feed enough of these in, you will,

16:56.100 --> 16:59.460
 oh, another fun one is like, you know,

16:59.460 --> 17:01.580
 real users will type their credit card

17:01.580 --> 17:03.720
 like one number at a time.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.280
 Scammers have a list of them

17:05.280 --> 17:08.260
 and they'll just paste in a whole number.

17:08.260 --> 17:10.760
 So you can look at like the number of milliseconds

17:10.760 --> 17:11.900
 between keystrokes.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.700
 Like there's all kinds of stuff people have come up with.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.340
 And even for travel velocity,

17:15.340 --> 17:17.740
 you could probably incorporate VPNs too

17:17.740 --> 17:21.100
 because there's probably a travel velocity

17:21.100 --> 17:24.500
 for VPN switching too that's human like.

17:24.500 --> 17:27.340
 Like if you're using legitimately VPN for something else,

17:27.340 --> 17:31.060
 that might be, there's like legitimate uses too.

17:31.060 --> 17:32.660
 Actually, you know, I feel embarrassed

17:32.660 --> 17:34.860
 that I don't know this, probably should.

17:34.860 --> 17:37.640
 But the, I'm not a robot.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.300
 Capture thing. Capture thing.

17:39.300 --> 17:40.140
 Yeah.

17:40.140 --> 17:42.580
 So that probably works in the same way.

17:42.580 --> 17:46.020
 Like how do you move your mouse maybe

17:46.020 --> 17:48.960
 or how the dynamics of the clicking.

17:48.960 --> 17:49.800
 Totally.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.660
 But how does that even work that well then?

17:51.660 --> 17:52.960
 And why can't it be fake?

17:52.960 --> 17:53.940
 I need to look into this.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.860
 Cause it's such a trivial capture.

17:56.860 --> 17:58.740
 It feels like it should be very crackable.

17:58.740 --> 18:02.340
 And yet a lot of high security places use that.

18:02.340 --> 18:03.180
 Yeah.

18:03.180 --> 18:04.000
 It's really interesting.

18:04.000 --> 18:04.940
 It's another cat and mouse game.

18:04.940 --> 18:05.960
 So I think they've, yeah,

18:05.960 --> 18:07.460
 but it's using a lot of similar signals

18:07.460 --> 18:10.220
 like mouse movements, keystrokes.

18:10.220 --> 18:12.060
 And then obviously all the stuff that comes over

18:12.060 --> 18:14.180
 the wire with your browser.

18:14.180 --> 18:17.340
 So like what operating system, what fonts,

18:17.340 --> 18:18.940
 what headers are being sent over.

18:18.940 --> 18:21.940
 And there's actually, there's an old website.

18:21.940 --> 18:22.780
 I can't remember what it's called.

18:22.780 --> 18:24.180
 It was kind of like Panoptik Click

18:24.180 --> 18:25.500
 or Panopticon or something.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.560
 But it basically was like a proof of concept site

18:27.560 --> 18:30.180
 that they would just show you all the data

18:30.180 --> 18:33.080
 that was kind of getting sent over with your request.

18:33.080 --> 18:36.140
 And like say that there's only one person in the world

18:36.140 --> 18:37.420
 who has this exact set of data.

18:37.420 --> 18:38.260
 It's you.

18:38.260 --> 18:41.100
 And so it's almost like a workaround,

18:41.100 --> 18:43.820
 a clever workaround to track somebody,

18:43.820 --> 18:45.420
 make identify a unique person,

18:45.420 --> 18:48.320
 even if like there wasn't a cookie involved or something.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.140
 Yeah, this is a fascinating world

18:50.140 --> 18:52.740
 where you can't see anybody here in the dark

18:52.740 --> 18:54.060
 and yet you have a lot of signal

18:54.060 --> 18:56.260
 and you have to figure out who's a real person, who's not.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.380
 Who's a robot, who's not.

18:58.380 --> 18:59.220
 Let me step back.

18:59.220 --> 19:00.660
 We're gonna jump around all over the place.

19:00.660 --> 19:01.500
 Let me step back.

19:01.500 --> 19:02.320
 That's why I like your interviews.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.140
 You get into like technical topics.

19:05.220 --> 19:09.240
 So just let's use Bitcoin as a measure of time.

19:09.240 --> 19:12.180
 You started Coinbase when Bitcoin was $10.

19:14.460 --> 19:17.020
 And you just mentioned an incredible system

19:17.020 --> 19:19.800
 with security, with transactions.

19:19.800 --> 19:20.920
 Everything is thought through.

19:20.920 --> 19:21.980
 There's a lot going on.

19:21.980 --> 19:25.060
 But what was version one back in those early days,

19:25.060 --> 19:26.740
 the first prototype of Coinbase?

19:26.740 --> 19:28.300
 What did that look like?

19:28.300 --> 19:31.060
 Like what did it take to write it,

19:31.060 --> 19:35.420
 to think through it and make it work enough

19:35.420 --> 19:38.580
 to at least make you believe that it's gonna work?

19:38.580 --> 19:40.060
 Well, I definitely didn't know if it was gonna work.

19:40.060 --> 19:41.380
 I mean, it was kind of,

19:41.380 --> 19:44.100
 I felt like I was just following my gut.

19:44.100 --> 19:47.020
 So, I mean, I was working at Airbnb.

19:47.020 --> 19:50.060
 I was a software engineer there, project manager.

19:50.060 --> 19:52.660
 I was working on some fraud prevention stuff, for instance.

19:52.660 --> 19:55.280
 And I read the Bitcoin white paper

19:55.280 --> 19:57.020
 in kind of December of 2010.

19:57.900 --> 20:01.020
 I started going to some Bitcoin meetups in the Bay Area,

20:01.020 --> 20:02.300
 met lots of interesting people there,

20:02.300 --> 20:04.740
 like crazy people, anarchists,

20:04.740 --> 20:06.860
 really brilliant people, all the above.

20:06.860 --> 20:09.220
 And so I started nights and weekends

20:09.220 --> 20:11.220
 trying to put together a prototype.

20:11.220 --> 20:12.660
 And my initial thought was,

20:13.700 --> 20:16.700
 well, SMTP is a protocol that runs email.

20:16.700 --> 20:21.140
 And Git is a protocol for version control

20:21.140 --> 20:23.380
 that people made like Gmail and GitHub.

20:23.380 --> 20:25.500
 Most people don't wanna run their own email server

20:25.500 --> 20:26.860
 or even their own Git server.

20:26.860 --> 20:28.920
 They just wanna like use a hosted thing

20:28.920 --> 20:31.700
 that will do all the security and backups for them.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.020
 So the thought in my head at that time

20:33.020 --> 20:34.620
 was Bitcoin's this new protocol.

20:34.620 --> 20:35.620
 There's probably gonna be somebody

20:35.620 --> 20:37.460
 who makes a hosted service

20:37.460 --> 20:39.300
 that does all the security and backups for you,

20:39.300 --> 20:42.100
 makes Bitcoin as a protocol easy to use.

20:42.100 --> 20:45.860
 So maybe I should make like a hosted Bitcoin wallet

20:45.860 --> 20:47.180
 or something, that was my,

20:47.180 --> 20:50.020
 it was gonna make Gmail for Bitcoin or something.

20:50.020 --> 20:52.860
 And a bunch of people told me that was a bad idea.

20:52.860 --> 20:55.060
 Like most of my smart friends who I told about it,

20:55.060 --> 20:55.900
 they were like,

20:56.920 --> 20:57.980
 well, first of all,

20:57.980 --> 20:59.460
 I don't really get what you're doing at all.

20:59.460 --> 21:01.100
 Like Bitcoin sounds like a scam

21:01.100 --> 21:03.060
 or something you've gotten involved in.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.020
 But then other people who understood what Bitcoin was

21:06.020 --> 21:07.100
 told me they thought it was a dumb idea

21:07.100 --> 21:09.960
 because they're like, dude, if you store all this Bitcoin,

21:09.960 --> 21:10.820
 you're just gonna get hacked.

21:10.820 --> 21:14.820
 Like nobody, you know, why would you do that?

21:14.820 --> 21:18.180
 And so I kind of had this thought like, you know what?

21:18.180 --> 21:21.140
 I'm not gonna go all in and like make a store

21:21.140 --> 21:22.700
 everyone's Bitcoin, that would be too much right now.

21:22.700 --> 21:25.060
 I have a job, I have a day job, you know?

21:25.060 --> 21:26.580
 But let me just make a prototype

21:26.580 --> 21:28.300
 and I'll tell people this is like a beta thing.

21:28.300 --> 21:29.580
 Like don't put any real money in it

21:29.580 --> 21:31.100
 and just see if there's interest.

21:31.100 --> 21:32.280
 And if I feel like I'm onto something,

21:32.280 --> 21:33.860
 maybe I'll go do this as a company.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.460
 Cause I did, I really wanted to be an entrepreneur

21:35.460 --> 21:36.300
 at that time.

21:36.300 --> 21:38.700
 I was like, I was 29, I was almost turning 30.

21:38.700 --> 21:40.520
 And I was, I always wanted to like start a company,

21:40.520 --> 21:43.580
 but I was, you know, I wasn't yet.

21:43.580 --> 21:45.020
 I was an employee at a company that was great.

21:45.020 --> 21:47.740
 But so anyway, I had this prototype.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.300
 I was hacking together nights and weekends.

21:50.300 --> 21:53.900
 I actually wrote a whole Bitcoin node in Ruby,

21:53.900 --> 21:55.760
 which turned out to be a, maybe a weird decision

21:55.760 --> 21:57.200
 in hindsight, cause Ruby wasn't the most

21:57.200 --> 21:58.040
 performant language.

21:58.040 --> 21:59.680
 We've subsequently had to rebuild that many times.

21:59.680 --> 22:03.140
 But yeah, I had this hosted Bitcoin wallet

22:03.140 --> 22:05.980
 and the thing that I didn't have any users for it,

22:05.980 --> 22:08.020
 by the way, I applied to Y Combinator

22:08.020 --> 22:10.700
 cause I was like, maybe if somebody there writes me a check,

22:10.700 --> 22:12.340
 this will like make it feel like a real company.

22:12.340 --> 22:14.660
 And I was trying to find a co founder at that time

22:14.660 --> 22:16.100
 unsuccessfully.

22:16.100 --> 22:18.220
 So I was basically just wandering in the desert.

22:18.220 --> 22:21.580
 I had a lot of self doubt about this cause I was like,

22:21.580 --> 22:24.220
 I don't know, all my friends don't think this is kind of dumb

22:24.220 --> 22:27.380
 and maybe Bitcoin is just gonna get shut down

22:27.380 --> 22:29.020
 and like, this is all be some stupid thing.

22:29.020 --> 22:31.820
 So there was definitely a feeling of just wandering

22:31.820 --> 22:33.780
 lost in the desert, lots of self doubt.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.180
 Paul Graham and the Y Combinator group

22:37.180 --> 22:38.580
 kind of wrote me the first check

22:38.580 --> 22:39.860
 after I went and interviewed and stuff.

22:39.860 --> 22:42.380
 And they wrote me a check for like 150K.

22:42.380 --> 22:43.980
 And that was the first time somebody

22:43.980 --> 22:46.020
 who I really looked up to kind of said,

22:46.020 --> 22:47.540
 this is worth pursuing.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.240
 Like maybe you're onto something, maybe you're not,

22:49.240 --> 22:50.940
 but like, let's at least try it.

22:50.940 --> 22:53.740
 And so that was kind of what gave me the confidence

22:53.740 --> 22:55.420
 to quit my job and try it.

22:55.420 --> 22:59.820
 And I'll wrap the story here by saying that like we,

22:59.820 --> 23:02.860
 I found the right co founder after Y Combinator.

23:02.860 --> 23:03.980
 We still didn't have any customers.

23:03.980 --> 23:05.220
 The thing that,

23:05.220 --> 23:07.600
 I basically launched the hosted Bitcoin wallet.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.100
 There were people signing up.

23:09.100 --> 23:11.300
 I just posted on Reddit and places like that.

23:11.300 --> 23:13.300
 And maybe like a hundred people would sign up

23:13.300 --> 23:14.980
 and then nobody would come back.

23:14.980 --> 23:18.300
 And so I was like, I just in Y Combinator,

23:18.300 --> 23:20.300
 they often tell you like,

23:20.300 --> 23:21.860
 talk to your customers and improve your product.

23:21.860 --> 23:23.140
 Talk to your customers, improve your product.

23:23.140 --> 23:24.220
 That's all you're supposed to be doing.

23:24.220 --> 23:25.760
 Try to find product market fit.

23:25.760 --> 23:28.820
 So I emailed like five of the users that had signed up

23:28.820 --> 23:30.540
 and I was like, hey, I worked on this app.

23:30.540 --> 23:31.380
 I saw you signed up.

23:31.380 --> 23:32.200
 Can I get on the phone with you?

23:32.200 --> 23:34.420
 I get on the phone with like five of these folks.

23:34.420 --> 23:36.820
 And I was like, why didn't you come back?

23:36.820 --> 23:38.860
 And the guy was like, well, the app was okay

23:38.860 --> 23:41.620
 for a beta, but like, I don't have any Bitcoins.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.380
 So I didn't really know what to do with it.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.000
 And I remember this light bulb kind of went off in my head.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.040
 I was like, well, if I put a buy Bitcoin button in there,

23:48.900 --> 23:49.740
 would you have used it?

23:49.740 --> 23:51.500
 And he was like, yeah, maybe.

23:51.500 --> 23:54.180
 So then I had this, we went about the process.

23:54.180 --> 23:55.140
 My co founder at that time,

23:55.140 --> 23:57.920
 we like got basically had to get like a bank partnership,

23:57.920 --> 23:59.300
 payment rails, you know, an exchange,

23:59.300 --> 24:00.420
 basic exchange functionality,

24:00.420 --> 24:03.620
 all that stuff I was mentioning earlier in place.

24:03.620 --> 24:05.340
 And the minute we launched that feature

24:05.340 --> 24:06.260
 where you could just click buy,

24:06.260 --> 24:07.620
 put in your bank counter credit card,

24:07.620 --> 24:09.580
 buy Bitcoin, it showed up in your account.

24:09.580 --> 24:10.400
 From that day forward,

24:10.400 --> 24:12.620
 like the number of users started to go up like this.

24:12.620 --> 24:14.980
 And so we finally had found product market fit

24:14.980 --> 24:17.140
 after two years of wandering in the desert.

24:17.140 --> 24:20.460
 So you weren't even thinking about to buy the on ramps.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.060
 You would think it would be just the wallet,

24:22.060 --> 24:26.340
 a place to store Bitcoin that you've already gotten.

24:26.340 --> 24:27.500
 Yeah. Okay.

24:27.500 --> 24:31.140
 This is, I mean, cause that's such a pain to do,

24:31.140 --> 24:34.380
 to have to work with others to convert dollars

24:34.380 --> 24:37.820
 and fiat currency into Bitcoin.

24:37.820 --> 24:38.660
 Yeah.

24:38.660 --> 24:39.700
 So did you, I mean,

24:39.700 --> 24:44.700
 were you overwhelmed by the immensity of the task here

24:45.400 --> 24:50.400
 or were you just sort of not allowing yourself

24:51.860 --> 24:53.860
 to think too deeply through this whole thing

24:53.860 --> 24:57.180
 and just letting the optimism take over here?

24:59.020 --> 25:00.560
 You know, I was really looking forward

25:00.560 --> 25:03.300
 to like doing something crazy and like a big challenge.

25:03.300 --> 25:08.300
 And I wanted to, I love kind of crisis moments like that

25:09.580 --> 25:12.300
 where, you know, I'm very determined, right?

25:12.300 --> 25:14.820
 And especially when I get like very set on something

25:14.820 --> 25:15.700
 and I'm just like, you know what?

25:15.700 --> 25:18.420
 I'm gonna figure out a way to make this fucking thing work,

25:18.420 --> 25:19.700
 like no matter what.

25:19.700 --> 25:23.160
 And so I reveled in that.

25:23.160 --> 25:26.220
 I was sort of, I had read all these books about startups

25:26.220 --> 25:28.140
 and like every startup has these like, you know,

25:28.140 --> 25:30.340
 major setbacks and just like nothing works.

25:30.340 --> 25:33.460
 And so that was a sign that you're doing something right.

25:33.460 --> 25:35.500
 I had no idea if I was doing anything right at all,

25:35.500 --> 25:38.260
 but I was like, I was kind of loving the experience of it

25:38.260 --> 25:39.100
 in a weird way.

25:39.100 --> 25:41.000
 It felt, it felt stressful at the time.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.820
 Like, you know, nothing was working and,

25:43.820 --> 25:47.220
 but I was just, I felt like I was on the right path somehow.

25:47.220 --> 25:49.220
 And so I just kept going, I don't know.

25:50.940 --> 25:53.940
 What was the darkest moment that you've gone to

25:53.940 --> 25:56.500
 in your mind during that time?

25:56.500 --> 25:58.700
 What was, what were some of the tougher moments?

25:58.700 --> 26:00.460
 You said self doubt.

26:00.460 --> 26:01.860
 Yeah.

26:01.860 --> 26:04.700
 Have you, yeah, where'd you go?

26:04.700 --> 26:06.020
 Where'd you go in your mind?

26:06.020 --> 26:10.460
 Is there a moment where you're just like laying there?

26:10.460 --> 26:12.220
 This is, this is hopeless.

26:13.380 --> 26:15.500
 Well, there's a couple of moments I'm remembering.

26:15.500 --> 26:18.280
 I mean, so for whatever reason,

26:18.280 --> 26:20.780
 I had this like big chip on my shoulder at that time.

26:20.780 --> 26:21.900
 And I was like,

26:21.900 --> 26:23.900
 I really want to do something important in the world.

26:23.900 --> 26:26.260
 Like, you know, I could have a good life

26:26.260 --> 26:27.860
 and like work for some good companies

26:27.860 --> 26:29.100
 and write some software.

26:29.100 --> 26:31.940
 And I'm, for some reason, I never wanted that for myself.

26:31.940 --> 26:33.340
 That probably would have been healthier, honestly,

26:33.340 --> 26:35.860
 just to like, as an expected value outcome,

26:35.860 --> 26:38.020
 that's probably a better thing in life.

26:38.020 --> 26:40.260
 But I was like, I was like, man,

26:40.260 --> 26:41.940
 I really want to do something important

26:41.940 --> 26:43.140
 and have a bigger impact.

26:43.140 --> 26:46.220
 And I was like, I was willing to sacrifice a lot for that.

26:46.220 --> 26:49.620
 I was like sleep and not going out with friends and stuff.

26:49.620 --> 26:50.660
 I remember one of the,

26:50.660 --> 26:52.740
 just for like years working on this stuff,

26:52.740 --> 26:55.940
 I remember one of the darker moments was,

26:55.940 --> 27:00.160
 we probably had like maybe five employees at that time.

27:00.160 --> 27:03.560
 And I remember like a bunch of bad things happened

27:03.560 --> 27:04.440
 like all at once.

27:04.440 --> 27:06.660
 And it was, so first of all,

27:06.660 --> 27:08.860
 you have to remember at this time,

27:08.860 --> 27:10.400
 we were all very sleep deprived,

27:10.400 --> 27:11.900
 which kind of exacerbates everything.

27:11.900 --> 27:14.460
 If you look at like the Exxon Valdez spill

27:14.460 --> 27:16.300
 and all these like natural disasters,

27:16.300 --> 27:18.520
 like sleep deprivation is often involved.

27:18.520 --> 27:20.960
 So, because the reason why we were so sleep deprived

27:20.960 --> 27:22.080
 is not just because we were working so much,

27:22.080 --> 27:25.240
 but like the site would go offline in the middle of the night

27:25.240 --> 27:26.280
 and we'd get, I'd get paged.

27:26.280 --> 27:27.180
 I was like on pager duty.

27:27.180 --> 27:28.280
 So I'd get woken up sometimes

27:28.280 --> 27:29.400
 like two or three times a night,

27:29.400 --> 27:31.920
 like have to try to fix something, go back to sleep.

27:31.920 --> 27:35.000
 So in that environment, you can kind of get,

27:35.000 --> 27:37.040
 you can get discouraged.

27:37.040 --> 27:39.360
 So one bad thing that happened was,

27:39.360 --> 27:40.680
 we had a bug on the website

27:40.680 --> 27:43.760
 and there was thousands of people on Reddit and Twitter

27:43.760 --> 27:46.640
 who were all like pissed at Coinbase

27:46.640 --> 27:48.320
 because like the balances were showing wrong.

27:48.320 --> 27:51.580
 And they were just like, fuck this company, it's over.

27:51.580 --> 27:52.520
 Like, I hate these guys.

27:52.520 --> 27:55.320
 And so that was, I'd never had this feeling

27:55.320 --> 27:57.280
 of a thousand people mad at me at the same time.

27:57.280 --> 27:58.840
 You know, I feel like I'm a pretty chill guy.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.440
 Like most of the time people don't get mad at me.

28:00.440 --> 28:02.080
 So that was one.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.400
 Another one was that.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.240
 Can we pause on that?

28:04.240 --> 28:05.220
 That's so interesting.

28:05.220 --> 28:07.100
 So you were saying like, here's a dream.

28:07.100 --> 28:08.660
 I'm trying to create something.

28:08.660 --> 28:13.200
 And now forever, the reputation of this dream is ruined.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.000
 It will never, it's irrecoverable.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.220
 It's over, that kind of feeling.

28:17.220 --> 28:18.640
 Yeah, well, I didn't, you're right.

28:18.640 --> 28:19.600
 I didn't know at that time.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.640
 I was like, is this, is this the end?

28:21.640 --> 28:24.200
 Like everybody, we're so, we're so tiny.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.120
 Now everybody hates us.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.320
 So is it over?

28:26.320 --> 28:27.160
 Yeah.

28:28.760 --> 28:30.760
 Nobody told me this before starting a company

28:30.760 --> 28:33.560
 that like, you're a bunch of people will hate you for this,

28:33.560 --> 28:35.200
 which is like a very counterintuitive thing.

28:35.200 --> 28:38.200
 Cause you know, most companies I think are doing

28:38.200 --> 28:39.760
 good things in the world, at least you're trying, right?

28:39.760 --> 28:41.960
 And so even if someone's like trying,

28:41.960 --> 28:42.840
 but they're not, they're failing,

28:42.840 --> 28:43.920
 I'm generally rooting for them.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.360
 At least you're trying, right?

28:45.360 --> 28:47.080
 But that's not the case at all.

28:47.080 --> 28:50.160
 And most founders I've known have gone through this too,

28:50.160 --> 28:53.320
 where they're very surprised at the amount of hate

28:53.320 --> 28:54.160
 that they get.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.920
 And if it's, I think it's actually like a muscle

28:55.920 --> 28:57.720
 you can build your tolerance to it.

28:57.720 --> 29:01.440
 Like, because you know, you go talk to somebody who's like,

29:01.440 --> 29:02.400
 for you, it feels terrible

29:02.400 --> 29:04.480
 cause you're at the center of this storm and like,

29:04.480 --> 29:06.360
 but if you go, then you go talk to like, you know,

29:06.360 --> 29:08.120
 your family or some other person like, dude,

29:08.120 --> 29:08.960
 I didn't even hear about that.

29:08.960 --> 29:11.300
 Like my, they're just busy in their own life.

29:11.300 --> 29:13.400
 And so they, they have no idea

29:13.400 --> 29:14.800
 that you had all this negative press

29:14.800 --> 29:16.500
 or like whatever it was.

29:16.500 --> 29:19.000
 Can I put once again, put a link on that?

29:19.000 --> 29:20.400
 Yeah.

29:20.400 --> 29:23.520
 There's an interesting person I'd like to bring up

29:23.520 --> 29:26.480
 just as an example, Bill Gates.

29:26.480 --> 29:27.600
 Yeah.

29:27.600 --> 29:31.560
 So he gets a very large amount of hate on the internet.

29:31.560 --> 29:32.400
 Yeah.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.240
 And there's something about him,

29:34.240 --> 29:35.440
 this is me talking that you,

29:35.440 --> 29:38.940
 that he seems out of touch about that hate.

29:39.960 --> 29:43.440
 I believe at least in my understanding

29:43.440 --> 29:46.280
 that with the resources he has,

29:46.280 --> 29:49.520
 he's trying and is actually doing a lot of good.

29:50.360 --> 29:52.640
 And yet there's a gigantic amount of hate,

29:52.640 --> 29:54.660
 conspiracy theories and stuff like that.

29:54.660 --> 29:55.500
 Right.

29:55.500 --> 29:57.960
 And it feels like that's the case

29:57.960 --> 30:02.080
 because he's somehow out of touch with people.

30:02.080 --> 30:04.360
 So I wonder how you stay in touch

30:04.360 --> 30:05.520
 with the voice of the people

30:05.520 --> 30:08.800
 without being destroyed by the outrage.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.160
 Is there any wisdom you have to that or?

30:11.160 --> 30:14.440
 I don't know about wisdom, but I've thought about this too,

30:14.440 --> 30:19.080
 because yeah, you wanna always be open to feedback,

30:19.080 --> 30:20.160
 especially from people who have

30:20.160 --> 30:22.380
 like your best interests at heart, right?

30:22.380 --> 30:25.440
 And if you can become isolated from it

30:25.440 --> 30:28.320
 and just like, you know, surrounded by yes people.

30:28.320 --> 30:32.480
 And I mean, who knows, maybe like she and Putin

30:32.480 --> 30:35.180
 and people like that are in situations I have no idea.

30:36.660 --> 30:39.080
 But if you listen to too much of it

30:39.080 --> 30:40.260
 and you just try to please everyone,

30:40.260 --> 30:41.460
 you'll never get anything done.

30:41.460 --> 30:44.880
 And I mean, most of the best leaders are people

30:44.880 --> 30:47.900
 who they can act when they believe

30:47.900 --> 30:49.740
 that they're doing something net positive

30:49.740 --> 30:51.520
 for the world and humanity.

30:51.520 --> 30:52.720
 And they actually don't really care

30:52.720 --> 30:55.600
 if they piss off some portion of the people.

30:55.600 --> 30:58.160
 Almost anything you're gonna do of significance

30:58.160 --> 31:01.080
 in the world today is gonna piss off 5% of people,

31:01.080 --> 31:04.840
 maybe 49% of people or whatever, maybe 60%, I don't know.

31:04.840 --> 31:07.700
 So you never wanna become so surrounded

31:07.700 --> 31:09.720
 by people who just work for you and will say yes.

31:09.720 --> 31:11.480
 And then you think like, well, I'm a genius

31:11.480 --> 31:15.240
 and I'm like, that's how you become a dictator or whatever.

31:15.240 --> 31:18.080
 But you also can't care so much about what people think

31:18.080 --> 31:19.320
 because then you'll never do anything

31:19.320 --> 31:21.560
 that's truly authentic to yourself.

31:21.560 --> 31:22.800
 One other thought on that, by the way,

31:22.800 --> 31:25.120
 I think it's a really good question.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.520
 So I've thought about this a lot.

31:26.520 --> 31:29.560
 Like why, you know, people generally kind of hate on Zuck

31:29.560 --> 31:32.360
 and they hate on Bill Gates and they hate on,

31:33.400 --> 31:34.800
 they don't really hate on Elon.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.040
 Well, actually Elon has a lot of haters too,

31:36.040 --> 31:37.360
 but it's a different thing.

31:37.360 --> 31:40.160
 This is measured, this is measured, I was looking

31:40.160 --> 31:43.800
 at some surveys, so I think Zuck is the most,

31:43.800 --> 31:45.600
 so loved and hated, right?

31:46.520 --> 31:50.720
 Zuckerberg is the most, both loved and hated.

31:50.720 --> 31:52.280
 He's the most hated.

31:52.280 --> 31:55.280
 And then I think it's Bill Gates and Elon is down there.

31:55.280 --> 31:59.880
 I think it's like 40% hate Zuck, people asked.

31:59.880 --> 32:02.600
 And then Elon is in the double digits,

32:02.600 --> 32:04.200
 but low double digits.

32:04.200 --> 32:06.760
 And so it's interesting, you just look at this data,

32:06.760 --> 32:08.080
 ask yourself why.

32:08.080 --> 32:10.400
 Right, so I ask myself this sometimes too,

32:10.400 --> 32:13.080
 because I don't claim to know any of these people well,

32:13.080 --> 32:15.080
 but like I've met them briefly.

32:15.080 --> 32:17.720
 And my impression is that they're actually all smart people

32:17.720 --> 32:18.760
 trying to do good things in the world.

32:18.760 --> 32:21.120
 So there's not too much difference there,

32:21.120 --> 32:23.280
 despite public perception.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.440
 So why is it that some are really hated and some aren't?

32:25.440 --> 32:28.080
 I mean, it's a complicated question.

32:28.080 --> 32:31.240
 Obviously Zuck in his Facebook got blamed

32:31.240 --> 32:34.240
 for the whole election thing and all that didn't help.

32:34.240 --> 32:36.280
 Social media has gotten a lot of pressure

32:36.280 --> 32:39.640
 just from like, hey, why aren't you solving

32:39.640 --> 32:40.800
 all of society's tough problems?

32:40.800 --> 32:42.640
 It's like, well, they're just one company.

32:42.640 --> 32:47.520
 But one thing I've noticed is that a lot of these people,

32:47.520 --> 32:49.800
 they have like Asperger's, right, a little bit.

32:49.800 --> 32:53.360
 And sometimes people with Asperger's

32:53.360 --> 32:54.760
 don't really emote in the same way.

32:54.760 --> 32:57.000
 And so I think it's almost a form of like

33:00.840 --> 33:05.840
 bias against their cognitive type or something,

33:05.840 --> 33:07.960
 which is like that person doesn't emote right.

33:07.960 --> 33:11.320
 I don't trust their intentions.

33:11.320 --> 33:14.440
 And the other thing I've thought about too

33:14.440 --> 33:16.840
 is that sometimes I think some leaders,

33:18.040 --> 33:19.320
 like maybe Zuck or Bill Gates,

33:19.320 --> 33:22.960
 they can come across as like a little bit PR rehearsed.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.920
 Like they're basically,

33:24.920 --> 33:26.960
 they're giving the PR approved answers

33:26.960 --> 33:29.720
 where Elon just says whatever he thinks like to a fault.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.320
 So even if people hate what he says or like,

33:31.320 --> 33:33.240
 at least I believe it's authentic.

33:33.240 --> 33:34.960
 So I've always thought about that too for myself.

33:34.960 --> 33:36.520
 I'm like, how do I,

33:36.520 --> 33:38.480
 cause you can fuck it up on both sides, right?

33:38.480 --> 33:39.960
 Like if you just come out and you're like saying

33:39.960 --> 33:42.240
 whatever stream of consciousness,

33:42.240 --> 33:44.680
 you'll often end up like pissing off people on your team

33:44.680 --> 33:47.520
 or like saying tripping over some like regulation

33:47.520 --> 33:50.400
 that you've, there's all kinds of things

33:50.400 --> 33:51.680
 about running a public company,

33:51.680 --> 33:53.120
 you can't say certain stuff.

33:53.120 --> 33:56.360
 But if you're too PR approved and your answer is like,

33:56.360 --> 33:58.280
 nobody trusts you what you're saying.

33:58.280 --> 34:00.480
 And so anyway, this is something I think about a lot.

34:00.480 --> 34:01.560
 I don't think I have the right answer,

34:01.560 --> 34:02.800
 but I'm trying to find that balance.

34:02.800 --> 34:05.360
 And more and more with the internet, there's a premium

34:05.360 --> 34:07.600
 on authenticity, just like you're saying.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.080
 People really, really appreciate that.

34:09.080 --> 34:11.960
 So for leaders, it's a challenge to be,

34:11.960 --> 34:15.640
 how do I make sure I'm authentic,

34:15.640 --> 34:19.600
 but also don't say stupid shit.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.000
 And so that's an interesting thing.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.720
 I've noticed that just having interacted

34:23.720 --> 34:28.720
 with a bunch of leaders that you have to be careful

34:28.920 --> 34:31.960
 how much you surround yourself with PR folks.

34:31.960 --> 34:34.520
 Because the best, I would say, let me just say a nice thing

34:34.520 --> 34:36.360
 about marketing and PR folks,

34:36.360 --> 34:40.720
 the best marketing folks are extremely good.

34:40.720 --> 34:43.680
 So they understand exactly what great marketing is

34:43.680 --> 34:46.080
 and great PR, it's authenticity.

34:46.080 --> 34:48.300
 It's showing, revealing the beauty.

34:48.300 --> 34:51.500
 As opposed to PR and marketing out of fear.

34:51.500 --> 34:54.440
 Oh, don't say that, don't say this, don't that.

34:54.440 --> 34:57.140
 Because then you start living in this kind of,

34:57.140 --> 34:58.520
 that pushes you towards a bubble

34:58.520 --> 35:00.280
 where you can't express the,

35:00.280 --> 35:02.040
 your beautiful quirks and weirdness

35:02.040 --> 35:03.280
 and all that kind of stuff.

35:03.280 --> 35:06.060
 And also the cool, the beautiful things

35:06.060 --> 35:07.120
 about what you're doing.

35:07.120 --> 35:10.280
 I find like, especially with tech things,

35:10.280 --> 35:12.120
 like even like Coinbase,

35:12.120 --> 35:15.080
 the way to reveal the beauty of it

35:15.080 --> 35:18.460
 is not only by showing all the things you could do with it,

35:18.460 --> 35:20.640
 but showing that there's great engineering

35:20.640 --> 35:22.180
 going on underneath.

35:22.180 --> 35:23.760
 So letting the nerds shine too.

35:23.760 --> 35:28.540
 It doesn't have to be like these kind of commercials

35:28.540 --> 35:33.500
 where it's like a happy family using Coinbase

35:33.500 --> 35:36.680
 to send a transaction about flowers for mom

35:36.680 --> 35:37.680
 or something like that.

35:37.680 --> 35:41.600
 Like it could be also like gritty stuff and real stuff.

35:41.600 --> 35:45.280
 So that's a general just observation I made.

35:45.280 --> 35:46.960
 But you said you were talking about dark moments

35:46.960 --> 35:49.040
 and that there's people on the internet

35:49.040 --> 35:51.200
 that were pissed off that the site was down.

35:51.200 --> 35:54.080
 And you said there might be something else.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.860
 Yeah, so sleep deprived,

35:55.860 --> 35:57.800
 like a bunch of people on the internet were pissed at me.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.440
 The balances were fucked up.

35:59.440 --> 36:01.200
 Like people were tweeting the company's over,

36:01.200 --> 36:03.600
 just give the money back, whatever.

36:03.600 --> 36:07.800
 And then, oh yeah, somebody posted.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.520
 So we had all this, we didn't,

36:09.520 --> 36:11.300
 we started to get all these customer support inquiries

36:11.300 --> 36:14.200
 and like, we only had like a few people at the company.

36:14.200 --> 36:18.000
 And so we were backed up maybe like 20,000 support requests.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.760
 So people couldn't get ahold of us.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.800
 So somebody posted my cell phone number on Reddit

36:22.800 --> 36:24.220
 and they were like, they were like,

36:24.220 --> 36:25.800
 if you need to get ahold of the CEO, whatever,

36:25.800 --> 36:28.240
 cause everyone's upset about where their money is.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.000
 So I remember we're in the office,

36:30.000 --> 36:31.460
 it's like late at night.

36:31.460 --> 36:33.560
 We've been working like 12 hours, we're all sleep deprived.

36:33.560 --> 36:36.640
 I'm trying to hack and like get this bug fixed.

36:36.640 --> 36:38.680
 And we all need like food at the office.

36:38.680 --> 36:41.040
 And so my phone has been blowing up all day

36:41.040 --> 36:43.040
 cause someone posted my phone number on the internet.

36:43.040 --> 36:44.140
 And there's like a guy,

36:45.360 --> 36:46.960
 there was a guy like trying to deliver food

36:46.960 --> 36:48.480
 and I needed to answer my phone

36:48.480 --> 36:50.440
 to like get the food from downstairs.

36:50.440 --> 36:53.000
 So I was like, shit, I gotta just see who, if that's him.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.960
 So I started answering the call and it's like,

36:55.960 --> 36:56.780
 is this Brian?

36:56.780 --> 36:58.480
 I'm like, nope, wrong number, click.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.920
 And I pick up the next call.

37:00.920 --> 37:02.640
 It's like every, when I finished the call,

37:02.640 --> 37:03.480
 another call is like coming in.

37:03.480 --> 37:06.400
 So I was like, I'm a reporter from Japan,

37:06.400 --> 37:09.040
 like asking about a security, nope, wrong number, click.

37:09.040 --> 37:11.120
 And then I like, finally I get the delivery guy downstairs,

37:11.120 --> 37:11.960
 bring the food up.

37:11.960 --> 37:15.220
 We were all like surviving to like fix this bug.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.980
 I remember there was just basically a point that night

37:18.980 --> 37:20.660
 where I was like, fuck, I need to just,

37:20.660 --> 37:24.440
 I basically just curled up on like a ball on the floor.

37:24.440 --> 37:27.320
 And I just like cried for a little bit.

37:28.440 --> 37:31.040
 I think I let myself just kind of wallow in self pity,

37:31.040 --> 37:32.760
 kind of took a nap for about five minutes.

37:32.760 --> 37:35.160
 And I was like, let's fucking solve this.

37:35.160 --> 37:38.320
 And I like, you know, stop being like a little whatever

37:38.320 --> 37:39.800
 and like got back up.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.200
 Sleep deprivation combined with just the stress

37:42.200 --> 37:44.720
 and the pressure of the site going down

37:44.720 --> 37:47.080
 and everybody wants the site to be up.

37:47.080 --> 37:48.640
 Just the pressure from people

37:48.640 --> 37:51.360
 and the number of users is growing and growing and growing.

37:51.360 --> 37:54.600
 So that pressure is just mentally, mentally tough.

37:54.600 --> 37:57.380
 What was your source of strength during that time?

37:58.320 --> 38:02.100
 Like what, like somebody that patted you on the back

38:02.100 --> 38:04.160
 and said, we got this.

38:04.160 --> 38:06.800
 Yeah, well, it definitely helped to have a co founder.

38:06.800 --> 38:10.000
 So, you know, there's like that old saying about

38:10.000 --> 38:12.280
 it's better to be in a great relationship than to be single,

38:12.280 --> 38:14.000
 but it's better to be single than in a bad relationship.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.320
 So co founders actually blow up a lot of companies too.

38:17.320 --> 38:18.680
 But when you find the right co founder,

38:18.680 --> 38:21.560
 which I was lucky to find with, with Fred or some,

38:21.560 --> 38:22.520
 that was very important.

38:22.520 --> 38:24.920
 There was definitely moments where, you know,

38:24.920 --> 38:28.840
 I was like kind of, you know, at the width end or whatever.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.600
 And he was like, it's like, dude, let's rally.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.440
 Like, and he basically carried the team, you know,

38:33.440 --> 38:35.440
 a couple of times, like in really key moments.

38:35.440 --> 38:39.060
 What advice would you give to startup founders

38:39.060 --> 38:43.480
 about this particular stage about surviving it

38:43.480 --> 38:46.760
 to the five and through the five employees stage

38:46.760 --> 38:47.600
 where you were?

38:47.600 --> 38:50.040
 Yeah, well, if your pre product market fit,

38:50.040 --> 38:52.760
 the best advice that I have from that period

38:52.760 --> 38:55.800
 is action produces information.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.800
 So just like keep doing stuff, you know,

38:58.800 --> 39:03.800
 I remember like Paul Graham, Paul Graham had this great

39:04.920 --> 39:05.740
 line like that.

39:05.740 --> 39:06.580
 I think that's his line.

39:06.580 --> 39:08.560
 And he was like, startups are like sharks.

39:08.560 --> 39:10.520
 If they stop swimming, they die.

39:10.520 --> 39:12.320
 You know, so even if you're like, not sure what to do,

39:12.320 --> 39:14.440
 like just do anything because when you do it,

39:14.440 --> 39:16.160
 it'll like, it'll produce some information.

39:16.160 --> 39:17.000
 Like people liked it.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.640
 They didn't, this was very true for me.

39:18.640 --> 39:21.560
 There was times where I just did something

39:22.640 --> 39:24.720
 instead of debating it endlessly and like, just try it.

39:24.720 --> 39:25.560
 You know, like, all right.

39:25.560 --> 39:26.380
 So we shipped it.

39:26.380 --> 39:27.980
 And like, there was a couple of times where like

39:27.980 --> 39:30.640
 the minute I shipped it and I was like, I knew,

39:30.640 --> 39:32.880
 I know we built this wrong,

39:32.880 --> 39:34.400
 but now I have an idea of what to do next.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.520
 And it wasn't, I only would have had the idea

39:36.520 --> 39:37.960
 if we'd actually gone through the exercise

39:37.960 --> 39:38.920
 of going to build it.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.680
 It's like my other favorite analogy for this is that

39:42.660 --> 39:44.560
 you're like at the base of a mountain that's shrouded

39:44.560 --> 39:47.120
 in fog and you're looking up at the mountain

39:47.120 --> 39:48.180
 and you're trying to think like, okay,

39:48.180 --> 39:49.020
 how do I get up there?

39:49.020 --> 39:51.000
 But you can only see like three or four steps ahead

39:51.000 --> 39:52.600
 cause the fog is so thick.

39:52.600 --> 39:55.920
 So you have to just take steps into the unknown.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.680
 And when you take three steps,

39:57.680 --> 39:59.960
 another three steps will be revealed ahead of you.

39:59.960 --> 40:01.940
 And sometimes you'll end up on some local maximum.

40:01.940 --> 40:03.580
 You'll have to retrace your steps or whatever,

40:03.580 --> 40:06.040
 but, or come up to a cliff, you know,

40:06.040 --> 40:11.040
 but most people in life don't take the steps into the fog,

40:11.480 --> 40:14.200
 into the unknown because it's scary.

40:14.200 --> 40:15.860
 Or they're like, I don't know, what if I fail?

40:15.860 --> 40:17.640
 Or like, I don't know how that's going to work

40:17.640 --> 40:18.480
 or I might run out of money

40:18.480 --> 40:19.800
 or I won't be able to get a job after,

40:19.800 --> 40:21.720
 or I don't know, whatever reason.

40:21.720 --> 40:24.520
 But that is like one of the things that separates,

40:24.520 --> 40:27.180
 I think entrepreneurial people with that kind of inclination

40:27.180 --> 40:31.720
 is that they have sort of a comfort with this risk tolerance

40:31.720 --> 40:33.880
 but it's actually not really risky if you think about it.

40:33.880 --> 40:38.200
 It's not like, you know, at least in most places,

40:38.200 --> 40:40.800
 like, you know, if you go to a startup and it fails,

40:40.800 --> 40:42.640
 like you're going to, you're even more valuable

40:42.640 --> 40:44.180
 to your next employer, right?

40:44.180 --> 40:47.260
 Or you can go raise a seed round, pay yourself a salary,

40:47.260 --> 40:49.080
 try it for like two years or three years.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.520
 If it doesn't work, go get another job.

40:50.520 --> 40:51.520
 It's not like you're,

40:51.520 --> 40:53.320
 you weren't paying yourself a salary during that time.

40:53.320 --> 40:55.700
 So I think, I think people overestimate the risk

40:55.700 --> 40:57.480
 of doing a startup and they just never,

40:57.480 --> 41:00.960
 they never start because it seems crazy

41:00.960 --> 41:02.140
 and all your friends think it's silly.

41:02.140 --> 41:03.600
 Like that's sort of the default nature

41:03.600 --> 41:05.600
 of every big startup idea.

41:05.600 --> 41:06.840
 It's just basic fear.

41:06.840 --> 41:08.920
 It's the same kind of fear that if you see a,

41:08.920 --> 41:11.680
 if you're a guy, see a cute girl at a bar,

41:11.680 --> 41:14.480
 it's the fear associated with coming up to her,

41:14.480 --> 41:15.840
 you like her, asking her.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.160
 It's like, what's the actual risk exactly?

41:18.160 --> 41:19.320
 Right.

41:19.320 --> 41:20.800
 She'll say, no thanks, I'm not interested.

41:20.800 --> 41:21.640
 No thanks.

41:21.640 --> 41:23.380
 I guess the risk is like,

41:23.380 --> 41:26.040
 that's going to be mentally difficult

41:26.040 --> 41:27.680
 to deal with rejection.

41:27.680 --> 41:31.040
 So just like it's mentally difficult to deal with failure.

41:31.040 --> 41:33.800
 If you had a bunch of ideas and you were excited about them

41:33.800 --> 41:37.160
 and you implement them and you realize they're not good,

41:37.160 --> 41:40.360
 that could be difficult to keep pushing through that.

41:40.360 --> 41:41.880
 But I suppose that's life.

41:41.880 --> 41:44.200
 You're supposed to, you know,

41:44.200 --> 41:48.080
 perseverance through the failures and then the risk is low.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.120
 So that's, and then the whole time through the fog

41:50.120 --> 41:52.360
 up the mountain, you're looking for product market fit.

41:52.360 --> 41:53.360
 Yeah, that's right.

41:53.360 --> 41:55.620
 So you know, you have it when the usage of your product

41:55.620 --> 41:57.400
 keeps growing without any marketing dollars

41:57.400 --> 41:58.240
 or anything like that.

41:58.240 --> 41:59.680
 It's just like more people keep coming back

41:59.680 --> 42:01.180
 every week or month.

42:01.180 --> 42:02.020
 So you're kind of keep,

42:02.020 --> 42:04.400
 you're basically watching your stats.

42:04.400 --> 42:05.840
 Nothing is working.

42:05.840 --> 42:09.360
 You see these little wiggles of false hope in your metrics

42:09.360 --> 42:11.380
 and you basically just keep talking to customers,

42:11.380 --> 42:12.680
 fixing the, improving the product,

42:12.680 --> 42:13.880
 talk to customers, improve the product,

42:13.880 --> 42:16.280
 talk to customers, improve product, you know,

42:16.280 --> 42:17.120
 and try not to run out of money.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.200
 So be really scrappy.

42:19.280 --> 42:22.320
 And then if you're lucky, you hit some kind of threshold

42:22.320 --> 42:24.060
 where like, okay, the thing is good enough now,

42:24.060 --> 42:26.760
 or we hit on some use case and then it'll organically

42:26.760 --> 42:28.340
 start to grow a bit.

42:28.340 --> 42:30.740
 And then you have a whole different set of problems

42:30.740 --> 42:31.680
 once you hit product market fit,

42:31.680 --> 42:34.220
 which is how do we scale this thing?

42:34.220 --> 42:35.720
 How do we hire people?

42:35.720 --> 42:39.120
 How do we, you know, hire an executive team

42:39.120 --> 42:39.960
 or raise more money?

42:39.960 --> 42:42.760
 And like, so the problems totally change, but yeah.

42:42.760 --> 42:45.080
 Well, you were there through the whole thing.

42:45.080 --> 42:48.120
 So that's the other question that's fascinating.

42:48.120 --> 42:50.960
 Again, back to the girl at the bar,

42:50.960 --> 42:52.240
 how do you hire people?

42:52.240 --> 42:55.360
 It's like, how do you find good friends?

42:55.360 --> 42:57.800
 How do you find good relationships?

42:57.800 --> 43:01.100
 And in this specific case, how do you hire good people?

43:01.100 --> 43:04.940
 Engineers, executive, all of it.

43:04.940 --> 43:06.720
 One thing is I've done a lot of reps on hiring

43:06.720 --> 43:07.560
 at this point.

43:07.560 --> 43:10.700
 So Coinbase has about 5,000 people,

43:12.040 --> 43:14.440
 probably the first 500 people or something,

43:14.440 --> 43:16.020
 maybe in that range.

43:16.020 --> 43:18.200
 You know, I interviewed every single one of those,

43:18.200 --> 43:20.780
 but you have to remember there's probably like,

43:20.780 --> 43:22.520
 I don't know, on average, maybe 10 people

43:22.520 --> 43:25.040
 that we went in the process for every one we hired

43:25.040 --> 43:25.860
 or something.

43:25.860 --> 43:29.360
 So it was like, by the time that we had 500 employees,

43:29.360 --> 43:31.280
 I had done like 5,000 interviews or something.

43:31.280 --> 43:32.880
 I was like very burned out on interviews.

43:32.880 --> 43:36.400
 I had been doing, some days I did like seven interviews

43:36.400 --> 43:39.320
 in a day or maybe, you know, you've been doing

43:39.320 --> 43:40.720
 lots of interviews, maybe you wouldn't get burned out,

43:40.720 --> 43:42.480
 but different kind of interviews.

43:42.480 --> 43:45.000
 Very different, very different, very different,

43:45.000 --> 43:49.200
 because you're, so first of all,

43:49.200 --> 43:51.440
 most of your interviews lead to rejection.

43:51.440 --> 43:52.560
 Yeah.

43:52.560 --> 43:54.760
 Which is also exhausting.

43:54.760 --> 43:57.440
 Yeah, and there's a whole part of the interview

43:57.440 --> 43:59.160
 which is about candidate experience, right?

43:59.160 --> 44:00.880
 Sometimes you know it's not the right person,

44:00.880 --> 44:02.440
 but you wanna make sure they have a good experience.

44:02.440 --> 44:03.280
 Yes.

44:03.280 --> 44:04.120
 Like, if you're just exhausted

44:04.120 --> 44:05.080
 and you're on your sixth interview

44:05.080 --> 44:06.840
 and you're like, well, thanks for coming in

44:06.840 --> 44:08.600
 and you wrap and you just, and then like,

44:08.600 --> 44:09.840
 you're gonna create a detractor.

44:09.840 --> 44:11.400
 Someone who's out there like, fuck that company

44:11.400 --> 44:12.680
 or Brian was rude to me or whatever.

44:12.680 --> 44:15.080
 So I had to, honestly, I had to work on that a little bit

44:15.080 --> 44:16.680
 in the early days because I was doing so many interviews.

44:16.680 --> 44:20.040
 Like I needed to make sure that when people came in,

44:20.040 --> 44:22.580
 I was like, you know, made them feel comfortable,

44:23.560 --> 44:25.280
 asked them a couple of like warmup questions,

44:25.280 --> 44:27.040
 just like, oh, how was it getting in the office?

44:27.040 --> 44:27.960
 Like, did you find it okay?

44:27.960 --> 44:29.220
 And like, what have you been up to this week?

44:29.220 --> 44:32.760
 And not just like, you know, like a factory assembly line

44:32.760 --> 44:34.880
 like boom, boom, boom, like, yeah.

44:34.880 --> 44:35.840
 But also there's a moment,

44:35.840 --> 44:37.040
 cause I've interviewed a bunch of people

44:37.040 --> 44:38.680
 for like teams and stuff.

44:38.680 --> 44:40.600
 There's also a moment when you, early on,

44:40.600 --> 44:42.720
 know it's not gonna be a good fit

44:42.720 --> 44:45.000
 and you still have to land that plane

44:45.000 --> 44:46.840
 and all that kind of stuff.

44:46.840 --> 44:49.340
 And that could get really, really, really exhausting.

44:49.340 --> 44:50.360
 So yeah, anyway, sorry.

44:50.360 --> 44:51.520
 So.

44:51.520 --> 44:53.280
 Yeah, so basically we tried all,

44:53.280 --> 44:54.400
 we've tried so many things over the years

44:54.400 --> 44:55.640
 to make interviews more efficient

44:55.640 --> 44:58.860
 cause it's a huge time sink for the team.

44:58.860 --> 45:00.720
 So, you know, we basically,

45:00.720 --> 45:03.320
 we'll usually get them down to like 25 minutes.

45:03.320 --> 45:05.880
 I've seen, if you're trying to hire like a big team,

45:05.880 --> 45:08.480
 let's say, you know,

45:08.480 --> 45:10.140
 of people who are like contractors or something,

45:10.140 --> 45:11.280
 not necessarily full time employees.

45:11.280 --> 45:14.280
 I've seen people actually do 10 minute interviews.

45:14.280 --> 45:16.400
 You can even interview like a thousand people

45:16.400 --> 45:17.760
 almost like in a week or something.

45:17.760 --> 45:18.920
 I'm not sure if that quite works out,

45:18.920 --> 45:20.860
 but let me a little less than that.

45:20.860 --> 45:23.680
 But you can basically get six and six done in an hour.

45:23.680 --> 45:25.880
 If you're just, I need to get a team of 30 contractors

45:25.880 --> 45:26.720
 for whatever purpose.

45:26.720 --> 45:28.480
 But if you're talking about full time employees,

45:28.480 --> 45:30.760
 I usually do like 25 minute.

45:30.760 --> 45:32.880
 You know, you're oftentimes like,

45:32.880 --> 45:37.320
 one thing we've done is we'll put like a Google form online

45:37.320 --> 45:39.560
 and it's like, put some basic hurdles in there.

45:39.560 --> 45:43.160
 Like, you know, ask them to put in an answer,

45:43.160 --> 45:44.260
 which you can check in a spreadsheet

45:44.260 --> 45:45.200
 if it was correct or not.

45:45.200 --> 45:46.760
 And like, there was some funny examples

45:46.760 --> 45:47.600
 in the early days of Coinbase

45:47.600 --> 45:49.280
 where we'd put in like brain teasers and stuff,

45:49.280 --> 45:50.480
 but we don't do that anymore.

45:50.480 --> 45:52.640
 We do like normal interviews, we do references.

45:52.640 --> 45:54.640
 The kinds of things I ask in interviews,

45:56.140 --> 45:57.840
 you know, it's usually like,

45:57.840 --> 46:00.380
 I like to think about what do we need this person

46:00.380 --> 46:03.000
 to accomplish in this role, right?

46:03.000 --> 46:05.300
 And get really specific about that.

46:05.300 --> 46:07.200
 It's like usually something pretty hard.

46:07.200 --> 46:08.540
 And then I'll ask them a question.

46:08.540 --> 46:11.360
 It's like, tell me about a time you did X

46:11.360 --> 46:14.580
 and, or tell me about the hardest,

46:14.580 --> 46:17.400
 the hardest kind of problem you've had to solve in Y

46:17.400 --> 46:20.360
 and what did you do specifically to overcome it, right?

46:20.360 --> 46:22.400
 So I'm asking to see if they can actually do the stuff

46:22.400 --> 46:23.240
 we need to get done.

46:23.240 --> 46:25.860
 But then I'm also kind of asking like culture questions

46:25.860 --> 46:27.440
 if I'm interviewing for that.

46:27.440 --> 46:29.400
 And so I'm trying to see like,

46:29.400 --> 46:30.840
 are they concise communicators?

46:30.840 --> 46:34.440
 Can they just give me a clear answer and stop talking?

46:34.440 --> 46:37.200
 Some people like ramble on for like five, 10 minutes

46:37.200 --> 46:38.720
 if you ask the first question.

46:38.720 --> 46:41.220
 Some people are, you know, they're interrupters

46:41.220 --> 46:42.160
 like church of interruption.

46:42.160 --> 46:44.840
 So like they won't stop talking until you interrupt them,

46:44.840 --> 46:46.780
 which for me, I'm always patient and I wait.

46:46.780 --> 46:48.220
 So that's weird.

46:49.380 --> 46:50.900
 I'm looking to see for humility too.

46:50.900 --> 46:53.360
 Like, you know, I'll tell us people,

46:53.360 --> 46:55.420
 I'll tell you about a time something went really wrong.

46:55.420 --> 46:57.080
 Like you had conflict with someone on a team

46:57.080 --> 47:00.200
 or what I'm kind of looking for is,

47:00.200 --> 47:01.320
 were they part of the solution

47:01.320 --> 47:03.780
 or are they still holding onto like blame and criticism

47:03.780 --> 47:04.620
 about that and be like,

47:04.620 --> 47:06.360
 well, I told them they shouldn't do that way,

47:06.360 --> 47:07.360
 but they didn't listen to me.

47:07.360 --> 47:09.440
 And you know, these are all like bad signs.

47:09.440 --> 47:11.960
 So I'm looking for, yeah, can they get the job done?

47:11.960 --> 47:13.600
 Will they work together on a team?

47:13.600 --> 47:15.800
 Can they communicate effectively?

47:15.800 --> 47:18.280
 Do they fit into our cultural values and you know,

47:18.280 --> 47:19.120
 those kinds of things.

47:19.120 --> 47:20.220
 Yeah, I mean, there's a,

47:20.220 --> 47:24.420
 cause I've even for help with this podcast here,

47:24.420 --> 47:27.420
 but also at MIT and so on, I've done a bunch of hiring

47:27.420 --> 47:30.360
 and I was always looking for, you said, brain teasers,

47:30.360 --> 47:33.080
 all kinds of simple questions that can,

47:33.080 --> 47:35.600
 they can reveal a lot of information

47:35.600 --> 47:36.860
 and it's always been challenging.

47:36.860 --> 47:39.060
 I used to, I still ask this question,

47:39.060 --> 47:43.820
 but do you think it's better to work hard or work smart?

47:45.580 --> 47:50.320
 And you know, I had this idea that I've,

47:50.320 --> 47:54.900
 that I think I've matured about,

47:54.900 --> 47:59.060
 which is I kind of believe that people who say work smart

47:59.060 --> 48:03.300
 on that question don't actually work smart.

48:03.300 --> 48:07.880
 So the right textbook answer is it's better to work smart.

48:07.880 --> 48:12.140
 But the reality is it's people that haven't actually

48:12.140 --> 48:14.980
 ever done anything that say work smart.

48:14.980 --> 48:17.860
 They're like, they haven't really struggled

48:17.860 --> 48:20.640
 because my general belief at the time

48:20.640 --> 48:25.640
 was in order to discover what it means to work smart,

48:25.780 --> 48:29.060
 to be efficient, to, you have to work your ass off.

48:29.060 --> 48:30.940
 So you have to really fail a lot

48:30.940 --> 48:33.460
 and failure feels like hard work.

48:33.460 --> 48:36.380
 And so I was always suspicious of people

48:36.380 --> 48:37.860
 that would say work smart.

48:37.860 --> 48:40.520
 I would want to interrogate that question.

48:41.380 --> 48:45.540
 But then I also, you know, have learned that there is people

48:45.540 --> 48:50.540
 that are just exceptionally, exceptionally efficient.

48:51.340 --> 48:53.860
 They really do know what it means to work smart,

48:53.860 --> 48:55.700
 even at a young age.

48:55.700 --> 48:58.500
 And so like, you can't just disqualify based on that.

48:58.500 --> 49:00.340
 You have to dig in deeper.

49:00.340 --> 49:02.780
 But some of the most interesting people I've ever worked

49:02.780 --> 49:05.020
 with would say work hard unapologetically.

49:05.020 --> 49:08.580
 And they're usually the ones that know how to be efficient,

49:08.580 --> 49:11.220
 which is, it's just an interesting thing like that.

49:11.220 --> 49:13.940
 And I've always searched for questions of that nature

49:13.940 --> 49:18.940
 to see can I get a person to reveal something profound

49:21.220 --> 49:25.580
 about them in as brief of a question as possible?

49:26.940 --> 49:28.540
 And I, you know, and then of course,

49:28.540 --> 49:31.500
 there's basic attention to detail and brain teasers

49:31.500 --> 49:33.380
 and stuff like that, depending on the role,

49:33.380 --> 49:38.060
 programming and so on to see can they solve a tricky puzzle

49:38.060 --> 49:40.960
 and do so, like one that doesn't require a lot of effort,

49:40.960 --> 49:45.960
 but requires a certain nonlinear way of thinking.

49:46.300 --> 49:49.800
 Is there some, I mean, maybe you don't want to reveal,

49:49.800 --> 49:52.740
 but is there some questions that you sometimes

49:52.740 --> 49:55.020
 find yourself leaning on?

49:55.020 --> 49:58.140
 You said like, how did you solve a hard problem

49:58.140 --> 50:01.380
 in your past and have them talk through it?

50:01.380 --> 50:02.220
 That's one.

50:02.220 --> 50:04.780
 You know, we started with brain teasers periodically

50:04.780 --> 50:07.700
 at Coinbase and we got away from that relatively quickly.

50:07.700 --> 50:10.860
 And I think one, it's a tough one

50:10.860 --> 50:15.180
 because I actually think it does show how somebody

50:15.180 --> 50:16.420
 kind of performs under pressure,

50:16.420 --> 50:18.680
 but it's, I don't think it's a super reliable indicator

50:18.680 --> 50:22.420
 because there's some people who are really good

50:22.420 --> 50:25.180
 in the typical work situation,

50:25.180 --> 50:26.460
 but that's not a typical work situation

50:26.460 --> 50:27.620
 where somebody puts you on the spot,

50:27.620 --> 50:29.920
 like in a live interview and sometimes people get nervous

50:29.920 --> 50:31.020
 and they can't think clearly

50:31.020 --> 50:32.700
 and like they don't have their computer in front of them

50:32.700 --> 50:34.520
 or whatever they normally use.

50:35.700 --> 50:39.220
 So yeah, I'm a little skeptical now

50:39.220 --> 50:41.060
 of the brain teaser thing.

50:42.340 --> 50:46.380
 There is a whole, yeah, there is a whole question about,

50:46.380 --> 50:48.100
 like a lot of universities are getting rid of,

50:48.100 --> 50:48.980
 you know, entrance exams.

50:48.980 --> 50:51.340
 So if you're hiring right out of universities,

50:52.680 --> 50:54.700
 sometimes it's becoming a less reliable indicator

50:54.700 --> 50:56.560
 of like, are they in that university?

50:56.560 --> 50:58.500
 And I've heard some companies, we haven't done this yet,

50:58.500 --> 50:59.780
 but I've heard some companies are actually creating

50:59.780 --> 51:01.660
 their own like for college grads,

51:01.660 --> 51:06.660
 like their own basically exams, like standardized testing

51:06.700 --> 51:08.140
 almost to get people in the door

51:08.140 --> 51:10.380
 because the degree almost like doesn't mean

51:10.380 --> 51:12.820
 what it used to, which is the whole topic, but.

51:12.820 --> 51:17.140
 Yeah, that's fascinating because it's fascinating both

51:17.140 --> 51:19.380
 for that, because it's not just about you trying

51:19.380 --> 51:22.300
 to hire a great team, it's also to help them find

51:22.300 --> 51:23.420
 the right place to work at.

51:23.420 --> 51:24.260
 Yeah.

51:24.260 --> 51:25.980
 It's like a two way street.

51:28.140 --> 51:32.180
 All right, so once you found the product market fit,

51:32.180 --> 51:37.180
 how did Coinbase become what it is today?

51:38.180 --> 51:39.020
 Ooh.

51:39.020 --> 51:42.180
 So let me ask an engineering question actually.

51:42.180 --> 51:47.180
 Sort of from the Ruby wallet days,

51:47.540 --> 51:50.420
 what are some of the interesting challenges there?

51:50.420 --> 51:52.340
 Or are they not engineering?

51:52.340 --> 51:56.540
 Just the things that had to be solved, what were they?

51:56.540 --> 51:59.100
 Engineering, regulation,

51:59.100 --> 52:04.100
 financial hiring, lawyers, what was it?

52:07.700 --> 52:10.580
 So post product market fit, yeah, a lot of it's scaling

52:10.580 --> 52:12.420
 and you got to build out an actual company.

52:12.420 --> 52:15.500
 So I remember I was still writing a lot of code there

52:15.500 --> 52:17.220
 for a while and we were hiring in,

52:17.220 --> 52:19.420
 we had like maybe 25 people or something.

52:19.420 --> 52:21.060
 I remember one of our investors came by one day

52:21.060 --> 52:22.860
 and he was like, Brian, how much of your time

52:22.860 --> 52:24.340
 are you spending writing code?

52:24.340 --> 52:27.260
 And I was like, maybe 50% or something.

52:27.260 --> 52:29.660
 And he was like, how much time are you spending hiring people?

52:29.660 --> 52:31.980
 I was like, probably 20%.

52:31.980 --> 52:35.220
 And he was like, I think you need to flip those numbers.

52:35.220 --> 52:36.740
 Like this company is not going to scale.

52:36.740 --> 52:39.420
 You're the CEO, you don't need to be writing code every day.

52:39.420 --> 52:40.820
 You're going to have to transition that stuff.

52:40.820 --> 52:41.940
 Like even if people can't,

52:41.940 --> 52:43.180
 all that stuff's locked in your head.

52:43.180 --> 52:44.740
 So maybe they're not going to do it as well as you

52:44.740 --> 52:46.580
 for the first six months or something.

52:46.580 --> 52:48.380
 But like, if you don't start to transition it,

52:48.380 --> 52:49.740
 you're never going to build a real company.

52:49.740 --> 52:52.620
 It's just going to be, you're going to be the bottleneck.

52:52.620 --> 52:55.860
 So, you know, like a lot of founders that took me a while

52:55.860 --> 52:57.260
 to like really internalize that lesson.

52:57.260 --> 52:59.780
 I'd always heard people say that and, you know,

52:59.780 --> 53:02.900
 but I still was holding on too much to decision making.

53:02.900 --> 53:04.100
 And I probably still am, by the way,

53:04.100 --> 53:05.380
 like even to this day at Coinbase,

53:05.380 --> 53:08.580
 where we continually have to push down decision making

53:08.580 --> 53:10.700
 in the org, like even with 5,000 people,

53:10.700 --> 53:12.260
 like who are the owners of each of these things?

53:12.260 --> 53:14.180
 And so the temptation is people to push it up

53:14.180 --> 53:15.060
 and you become a bottleneck.

53:15.060 --> 53:19.020
 And anyway, so yeah, you basically need to make sure

53:19.020 --> 53:21.180
 you have enough money where you don't die

53:21.180 --> 53:23.220
 if there's some kind of a downturn

53:23.220 --> 53:24.980
 or hit break even profitability.

53:24.980 --> 53:27.700
 We were in a position where we were periodically profitable

53:27.700 --> 53:29.300
 during up periods, but then crypto would go down

53:29.300 --> 53:30.620
 and we were unprofitable.

53:30.620 --> 53:33.300
 And so we had to kind of manage our own psychology

53:33.300 --> 53:35.940
 and the balance sheet to make sure we didn't like die

53:35.940 --> 53:38.980
 in the downturn, which a lot of crypto companies did.

53:38.980 --> 53:41.060
 We had to basically professionalize a whole bunch

53:41.060 --> 53:44.020
 of services that had been just very quickly thrown together

53:44.020 --> 53:46.060
 by like 20 year olds, right?

53:46.060 --> 53:47.900
 Whether that was cybersecurity, it's like, okay,

53:47.900 --> 53:50.380
 how do you get like a really senior experienced

53:50.380 --> 53:52.420
 cybersecurity person, but not someone who's so senior

53:52.420 --> 53:53.500
 that they can't get their hands dirty

53:53.500 --> 53:56.380
 and they can come into a company with 25, 50 people.

53:56.380 --> 53:58.140
 How do you get a finance person to come in and do that?

53:58.140 --> 54:00.060
 Our finances were a mess.

54:00.060 --> 54:01.900
 Like we didn't even really know how much money we had

54:01.900 --> 54:03.020
 at certain times and stuff.

54:03.020 --> 54:04.900
 I mean, this was, it's embarrassing to say,

54:04.900 --> 54:05.740
 but it was true.

54:05.740 --> 54:09.700
 Like I remember there was a point where we had raised,

54:09.700 --> 54:12.060
 I think like our series C or something like that.

54:12.060 --> 54:14.940
 And I think we had our bank accounts.

54:14.940 --> 54:17.100
 I just put like $25 million, like in a different bank

54:17.100 --> 54:19.020
 account that none of this stuff was touched

54:19.020 --> 54:20.140
 to the actual operations of business.

54:20.140 --> 54:23.620
 Cause I was like, our operations were so messy

54:23.620 --> 54:25.380
 and we needed to hire a new finance person.

54:25.380 --> 54:28.340
 And I was like, I'd heard horror stories

54:28.340 --> 54:29.540
 of actually startups where they thought

54:29.540 --> 54:31.420
 they had X amount of money.

54:31.420 --> 54:33.080
 And then it turned out they had way less.

54:33.080 --> 54:35.180
 And then the whole thing was insolvent in like three weeks.

54:35.180 --> 54:37.260
 So you wanted to have some padding to at least like,

54:37.260 --> 54:39.800
 all right, I can at least count on this to save us

54:39.800 --> 54:41.460
 if we go to like super negative.

54:41.460 --> 54:43.580
 Right, I mean, it was like a cheap hack,

54:43.580 --> 54:46.060
 but that was like the only I could come up with.

54:46.060 --> 54:49.660
 And until we could hire like a real CFO and finance team

54:49.660 --> 54:52.000
 who like, okay, now we got our arms around

54:52.000 --> 54:52.840
 how much cash we have.

54:52.840 --> 54:55.620
 It sounds silly, but we had such high volume

54:55.620 --> 54:56.620
 of money coming in and out.

54:56.620 --> 54:57.460
 Anyway.

54:57.460 --> 54:59.840
 What was the ordering of hiring by the way?

54:59.840 --> 55:03.420
 Like how many engineers was it early on?

55:03.420 --> 55:06.980
 You said CFO was not, you didn't even have a CFO for a bit.

55:06.980 --> 55:10.860
 Like what was the landscape of hiring

55:10.860 --> 55:12.480
 as you building up this company?

55:13.380 --> 55:15.260
 Was it engineering focused?

55:15.260 --> 55:16.100
 Well, let's see.

55:16.100 --> 55:18.540
 I mean, so the first person we hired was just like,

55:18.540 --> 55:20.040
 we need to solve customer support.

55:20.040 --> 55:20.980
 So we brought someone to do that

55:20.980 --> 55:22.500
 because we were all staying up till midnight every night

55:22.500 --> 55:23.840
 trying to do customer support.

55:23.840 --> 55:26.420
 And then we got more engineers.

55:26.420 --> 55:27.980
 And then I think maybe the sixth hire

55:27.980 --> 55:29.540
 or something like that was a recruiter.

55:29.540 --> 55:31.980
 Cause that turned out to be, you need to build,

55:31.980 --> 55:34.340
 hire the person who can hire more people.

55:34.340 --> 55:37.180
 That turned out to be a great force multiplier.

55:37.180 --> 55:39.780
 And then you're going down the list.

55:39.780 --> 55:42.520
 Eventually you want to hire some more senior people.

55:43.640 --> 55:45.220
 We needed legal and compliance.

55:45.220 --> 55:46.460
 We needed that really badly.

55:46.460 --> 55:48.540
 Cause we, it was all kinds of questions about

55:48.540 --> 55:50.400
 what the legality of it was.

55:50.400 --> 55:52.740
 Was it hard to find legal people that work with crypto,

55:52.740 --> 55:54.940
 like serious adults?

55:54.940 --> 55:57.540
 Cause it's such a cutting edge new world.

55:57.540 --> 56:01.100
 Yeah, I mean, there was nobody who had like more than,

56:01.100 --> 56:02.380
 nobody had three years of experience with it

56:02.380 --> 56:04.180
 cause it had only been around a few years.

56:04.180 --> 56:07.180
 So yeah, we were finding people from adjacent fields.

56:07.180 --> 56:08.860
 There's a certain personality type of people

56:08.860 --> 56:10.420
 who are willing to join early companies

56:10.420 --> 56:12.500
 because they have no structure.

56:12.500 --> 56:14.100
 You can't really commit to them about

56:14.100 --> 56:16.620
 you're going to have this team or this boss or whatever.

56:16.620 --> 56:18.920
 Like everything's in chaos and flux.

56:18.920 --> 56:22.340
 So it takes, yeah, hiring is one of the hardest things

56:22.340 --> 56:23.220
 in the early stage for sure.

56:23.220 --> 56:24.620
 You got to find people crazy enough

56:24.620 --> 56:26.240
 to join you on this journey.

56:26.240 --> 56:28.180
 So one of the interesting things about Coinbase

56:28.180 --> 56:31.340
 and you've written, we've talked, we'll talk about it a bit.

56:31.340 --> 56:33.540
 You're very focused on the mission.

56:33.540 --> 56:34.380
 Yeah.

56:34.380 --> 56:37.980
 You're very kind of, I think that simplifies things

56:37.980 --> 56:40.700
 that makes hiring easier,

56:40.700 --> 56:42.820
 that makes working at Coinbase easier,

56:42.820 --> 56:44.980
 that makes, I mean, it's similar.

56:44.980 --> 56:46.780
 So Elon has the same thing.

56:46.780 --> 56:47.740
 It's pretty clear.

56:47.740 --> 56:50.460
 It's pretty clear what we're here to do.

56:50.460 --> 56:55.460
 So I suppose what's the mission of Coinbase?

56:55.540 --> 56:57.860
 Well, it's to increase economic freedom in the world.

56:57.860 --> 56:59.940
 And what is economic freedom?

56:59.940 --> 57:02.660
 Yeah, so economic freedom is this term kind of like GDP

57:02.660 --> 57:04.060
 that economists use.

57:04.060 --> 57:05.820
 And it's basically a measure of different countries

57:05.820 --> 57:06.660
 around the world.

57:06.660 --> 57:07.660
 It looks at things like,

57:07.660 --> 57:09.700
 are there property rights enforced?

57:09.700 --> 57:10.780
 Is there free trade?

57:10.780 --> 57:12.520
 Is the currency stable?

57:12.520 --> 57:14.100
 Can you start companies that you wanna start?

57:14.100 --> 57:15.340
 And can you join the ones you wanna join?

57:15.340 --> 57:18.620
 And is there corruption and bribery prevalent

57:18.620 --> 57:20.700
 or is it relatively free of that?

57:20.700 --> 57:24.280
 And so there's several different organizations

57:24.280 --> 57:27.220
 that basically score countries by economic freedom.

57:27.220 --> 57:28.840
 And the really cool thing about economic freedom

57:28.840 --> 57:31.740
 is that basically it positively correlates

57:31.740 --> 57:33.340
 with things that we all want in society,

57:33.340 --> 57:36.620
 like not only higher growth of the economy,

57:36.620 --> 57:39.340
 but also things like higher self reported happiness

57:39.340 --> 57:41.780
 of citizens, better treatment of the environment,

57:41.780 --> 57:44.360
 better income for the poorest 10% of people.

57:44.360 --> 57:45.860
 And it negatively correlates with things

57:45.860 --> 57:46.780
 we don't want in society,

57:46.780 --> 57:48.980
 like corruption and bribery and war,

57:48.980 --> 57:50.500
 even in things like that.

57:50.500 --> 57:53.980
 And so it's this pretty crazy provocative idea,

57:53.980 --> 57:58.580
 which is that if you give people good property rights

57:58.580 --> 58:01.160
 and rule of law and allow them to trade,

58:01.160 --> 58:03.380
 it basically encourages them to do more good stuff

58:03.380 --> 58:05.240
 and the whole society benefits.

58:05.240 --> 58:08.320
 Like one of the things, you may have noticed this

58:08.320 --> 58:09.660
 growing up in various places you did,

58:09.660 --> 58:12.220
 or I spent a year living in Buenos Aires, Argentina

58:12.220 --> 58:13.340
 that went through hyperinflation.

58:13.340 --> 58:15.820
 And there's a certain like pessimism

58:15.820 --> 58:18.520
 that can creep into countries

58:18.520 --> 58:21.040
 when they don't have economic freedom,

58:21.040 --> 58:24.020
 which it's basically like everyone has this bit of this vibe,

58:24.020 --> 58:26.620
 which is like, don't stick your head up,

58:26.620 --> 58:28.960
 don't try too hard because it could all be gone tomorrow.

58:28.960 --> 58:30.900
 Like the things that really are valuable in life

58:30.900 --> 58:32.540
 are just family and friends

58:32.540 --> 58:35.440
 and the past was better than the future will be.

58:35.440 --> 58:37.580
 And so you don't really, people don't try as many,

58:37.580 --> 58:40.240
 they don't try hard because you're not really sure

58:40.240 --> 58:42.080
 you can actually keep the upside of your labor

58:42.080 --> 58:44.840
 if you try hard, so you just don't try as hard.

58:44.840 --> 58:47.700
 Whereas in America, historically,

58:47.700 --> 58:49.540
 or high economic freedom countries,

58:51.060 --> 58:53.720
 people basically like they just try more stuff

58:53.720 --> 58:55.520
 because they're like, if I do good for other people,

58:55.520 --> 58:56.800
 I'll get to keep part of it for myself

58:56.800 --> 58:58.100
 and I can improve my lot in life

58:58.100 --> 59:00.560
 and for my children and my community, whatever.

59:00.560 --> 59:03.700
 So I realized when I read the Bitcoin white paper

59:03.700 --> 59:06.700
 a long time ago, that at least I had a hunch.

59:06.700 --> 59:07.760
 At the time I was like,

59:07.760 --> 59:09.920
 this might be a really powerful piece of technology

59:09.920 --> 59:13.640
 that can inject good financial infrastructure

59:13.640 --> 59:15.940
 into all these countries around the world that don't have it.

59:15.940 --> 59:18.020
 Basically good economic freedom principles

59:18.020 --> 59:20.700
 in like property rights and things like that

59:20.700 --> 59:22.180
 into these countries all over the world,

59:22.180 --> 59:23.620
 which just as long as you had a smartphone

59:23.620 --> 59:25.140
 and now crypto got invented,

59:25.140 --> 59:27.260
 everybody could have economic freedom.

59:27.260 --> 59:28.960
 And it's crypto is kind of really well suited

59:28.960 --> 59:29.800
 for economic freedom,

59:29.800 --> 59:31.840
 because if you want property rights,

59:31.840 --> 59:32.940
 it's based like crypto is,

59:32.940 --> 59:34.620
 if you can remember a 12 word phrase

59:34.620 --> 59:37.020
 or have an app on your phone,

59:37.020 --> 59:38.620
 you can store as much wealth as you want.

59:38.620 --> 59:39.780
 And it can't be taken away from you.

59:39.780 --> 59:42.980
 You can even, there's like refugees who need to flee

59:42.980 --> 59:44.660
 and they wanna take their wealth with them

59:44.660 --> 59:46.240
 and they can't do it often

59:46.240 --> 59:47.500
 in the traditional financial system.

59:47.500 --> 59:49.760
 And so crypto lets them do that, right?

59:49.760 --> 59:51.060
 Crypto is inherently global.

59:51.060 --> 59:53.740
 So it allows free trade and cross border payments.

59:54.840 --> 59:57.860
 It makes it easy to accept payments from people globally.

59:57.860 --> 1:00:00.060
 It provides a stable currency to everyone,

1:00:00.060 --> 1:00:00.940
 not only with Bitcoin,

1:00:00.940 --> 1:00:03.080
 which is kind of like this new reserve currency,

1:00:03.080 --> 1:00:05.900
 but also with stable coins, right?

1:00:05.900 --> 1:00:08.220
 Which are new inventions there.

1:00:08.220 --> 1:00:10.860
 So yeah, I basically feel like crypto

1:00:10.860 --> 1:00:13.120
 is this secret hiding in plain sight

1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:14.780
 that can create economic freedom

1:00:14.780 --> 1:00:15.780
 for people all over the world

1:00:15.780 --> 1:00:18.980
 and a more fair and free and global economy.

1:00:18.980 --> 1:00:21.060
 Well, so the limit,

1:00:21.060 --> 1:00:22.860
 and by the way, I didn't know about Argentina.

1:00:22.860 --> 1:00:25.160
 Why'd you end up in Argentina?

1:00:25.160 --> 1:00:26.960
 Okay, so I was basically,

1:00:28.020 --> 1:00:30.180
 I was living in Houston, Texas after college

1:00:30.180 --> 1:00:31.500
 where I went to school.

1:00:31.500 --> 1:00:33.220
 And I had never studied abroad.

1:00:34.240 --> 1:00:36.220
 I kind of like, I don't know,

1:00:36.220 --> 1:00:38.140
 I felt like I needed some adventure or something in my life.

1:00:38.140 --> 1:00:40.220
 And I was like, I was running this other startup

1:00:40.220 --> 1:00:41.900
 that I was trying at the time, a tutoring company,

1:00:41.900 --> 1:00:43.740
 and I could work from anywhere.

1:00:43.740 --> 1:00:44.940
 So my plan was, you know what,

1:00:44.940 --> 1:00:47.260
 I'm just gonna go do like a month

1:00:47.260 --> 1:00:49.120
 in every city around South America,

1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:51.260
 just like almost like to force myself

1:00:51.260 --> 1:00:52.180
 out of my comfort zone

1:00:52.180 --> 1:00:54.640
 because I had never traveled by myself

1:00:54.640 --> 1:00:55.720
 to a foreign country or whatever,

1:00:55.720 --> 1:00:57.340
 and where I didn't really speak the language.

1:00:57.340 --> 1:01:00.420
 And anyway, I landed in Buenos Aires

1:01:00.420 --> 1:01:01.780
 thinking I'd go all around South America

1:01:01.780 --> 1:01:03.240
 where I had never been there.

1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:06.600
 But I basically, once I was set up in Buenos Aires

1:01:06.600 --> 1:01:08.160
 with an apartment and a cell phone and stuff,

1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:10.300
 then I was like, I don't wanna do that all again next month.

1:01:10.300 --> 1:01:11.620
 So I just stayed there for most of the time

1:01:11.620 --> 1:01:12.460
 and took some day trips.

1:01:12.460 --> 1:01:15.060
 But yeah, it was kind of a formative experience

1:01:15.060 --> 1:01:15.900
 in that regard.

1:01:15.900 --> 1:01:18.580
 You got a chance sort of unexpectedly

1:01:18.580 --> 1:01:21.460
 to experience the social effects of hyperinflation,

1:01:21.460 --> 1:01:22.500
 which is interesting.

1:01:22.500 --> 1:01:24.380
 But I also, I've never been,

1:01:24.380 --> 1:01:26.860
 I really, really wanna go as a person who likes tangos,

1:01:26.860 --> 1:01:29.980
 a person who likes the Argentinian national team

1:01:29.980 --> 1:01:34.340
 and soccer and steak.

1:01:34.340 --> 1:01:36.620
 All right, and all the other things

1:01:36.620 --> 1:01:38.240
 that Argentina is known for.

1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:41.380
 Okay, so economic freedom.

1:01:41.380 --> 1:01:43.620
 One of the limits on economic freedom

1:01:43.620 --> 1:01:46.300
 comes from government and government regulations

1:01:46.300 --> 1:01:49.360
 and all those kinds of things throughout the world.

1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:52.340
 So how does cryptocurrency help resist that?

1:01:52.340 --> 1:01:55.560
 So can you sort of elaborate a little bit further?

1:01:55.560 --> 1:01:57.900
 What are the things that limit economic freedom

1:01:57.900 --> 1:02:01.880
 and how does crypto help ease that?

1:02:03.340 --> 1:02:05.420
 Today the world, like the traditional financial system

1:02:05.420 --> 1:02:08.060
 is basically every country of the world for the most part

1:02:08.060 --> 1:02:10.220
 has their own currency.

1:02:10.220 --> 1:02:13.280
 And so there's a group of people or institutions

1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:15.360
 in each of those countries that's controlling

1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:18.560
 that economic policy or that money supply.

1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:22.380
 And it can be manipulated, right?

1:02:22.380 --> 1:02:25.100
 So it's not like many of these currencies

1:02:25.100 --> 1:02:26.820
 are not linked to gold standard.

1:02:26.820 --> 1:02:29.260
 The U.S. kind of famously came off that in 1970s,

1:02:29.260 --> 1:02:32.020
 for instance, but if you read Ray Dalio and all this stuff

1:02:32.020 --> 1:02:34.500
 like he talks about, there's thousands of fiat currencies

1:02:34.500 --> 1:02:36.700
 that have been in existence over time.

1:02:36.700 --> 1:02:39.660
 And basically all of them eventually get disconnected

1:02:39.660 --> 1:02:43.700
 from backing of like hard commodities

1:02:43.700 --> 1:02:46.460
 and then they get overinflated and printed.

1:02:46.460 --> 1:02:50.980
 And so in times of stress, with Nixon,

1:02:50.980 --> 1:02:53.780
 I guess it was like in the U.S. it was the Vietnam War

1:02:53.780 --> 1:02:54.900
 or something like that.

1:02:54.900 --> 1:02:56.340
 It kind of drove government spending.

1:02:56.340 --> 1:02:57.980
 And so under times of stress, they say,

1:02:57.980 --> 1:02:59.100
 hey, it's a temporary measure.

1:02:59.100 --> 1:03:00.820
 We need to break the peg.

1:03:00.820 --> 1:03:02.980
 Temporary was like famous words that he used

1:03:02.980 --> 1:03:07.500
 and they go print.

1:03:07.500 --> 1:03:09.300
 And so the bad thing about that, of course,

1:03:09.300 --> 1:03:11.980
 is that it sort of erodes people's like wealth

1:03:11.980 --> 1:03:13.580
 if they can only hold their assets in cash,

1:03:13.580 --> 1:03:16.820
 which basically like poor people tend to do that.

1:03:16.820 --> 1:03:19.220
 If you're wealthy, you can hold stocks

1:03:19.220 --> 1:03:20.740
 or like real estate and things like that.

1:03:20.740 --> 1:03:22.700
 But it's really a tax on the poorest people

1:03:22.700 --> 1:03:24.760
 in society, inflation.

1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:28.060
 So anyway, crypto in a way is a little bit

1:03:28.060 --> 1:03:30.260
 of like a return to the gold standard

1:03:30.260 --> 1:03:31.620
 in this digital era, right?

1:03:31.620 --> 1:03:33.820
 Bitcoin, there's guaranteed scarcity of it.

1:03:33.820 --> 1:03:34.940
 It's deflationary.

1:03:34.940 --> 1:03:37.420
 There's never gonna be more than 21 million Bitcoin.

1:03:37.420 --> 1:03:40.760
 And so that's a really important principle.

1:03:42.300 --> 1:03:44.300
 I also think not just Bitcoin,

1:03:44.300 --> 1:03:46.100
 but like cryptocurrency generally,

1:03:46.980 --> 1:03:48.980
 it's really important in terms of this,

1:03:48.980 --> 1:03:50.740
 you asked about regulation, right?

1:03:50.740 --> 1:03:55.060
 So think about like, if you wanted to make a global borrowing

1:03:55.060 --> 1:03:59.140
 and lending marketplace or a global exchange,

1:03:59.140 --> 1:04:01.800
 you would have to go to all 200 countries in the world,

1:04:01.800 --> 1:04:03.780
 sometimes like maybe 50 states in the US

1:04:03.780 --> 1:04:07.860
 and get lending licenses or an operating exchange

1:04:07.860 --> 1:04:09.020
 or whatever.

1:04:09.020 --> 1:04:12.900
 And that's just an incredible amount of work.

1:04:12.900 --> 1:04:14.900
 And you can't even do business in many of these countries

1:04:14.900 --> 1:04:17.300
 because like you have to bribe somebody

1:04:17.300 --> 1:04:18.860
 or it's corrupt or whatever.

1:04:18.860 --> 1:04:22.300
 And so, but with DeFi, with decentralized finance,

1:04:22.300 --> 1:04:24.860
 people have published like Uniswap

1:04:24.860 --> 1:04:26.300
 as a decentralized exchange.

1:04:26.300 --> 1:04:28.040
 Everybody in the world, no matter what country you're in,

1:04:28.040 --> 1:04:30.460
 what jurisdiction can interface

1:04:30.460 --> 1:04:32.420
 with that decentralized exchange

1:04:32.420 --> 1:04:35.480
 and there's no central company operating it.

1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:38.620
 It's a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain,

1:04:38.620 --> 1:04:40.160
 which is globally decentralized.

1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:41.260
 So there's no throat to choke.

1:04:41.260 --> 1:04:43.700
 There's no one person or a company you can go to

1:04:43.700 --> 1:04:45.500
 to like, hey, shut this thing down.

1:04:45.500 --> 1:04:48.900
 Even if everybody who's working on Uniswap today stopped,

1:04:48.900 --> 1:04:52.180
 the Uniswap smart contract would continue to operate

1:04:52.180 --> 1:04:53.580
 on the Ethereum blockchain.

1:04:54.460 --> 1:04:56.660
 Similarly for like a borrowing and lending marketplace,

1:04:56.660 --> 1:05:00.860
 like somebody in India wants to borrow

1:05:00.860 --> 1:05:02.380
 from somebody in the US or whatever,

1:05:02.380 --> 1:05:04.260
 there's very difficult to do that

1:05:04.260 --> 1:05:06.220
 in the traditional financial world,

1:05:06.220 --> 1:05:08.880
 but in a smart contract that's decentralized,

1:05:08.880 --> 1:05:10.660
 you can enable anybody to access it.

1:05:10.660 --> 1:05:14.260
 So it's really kind of this great democratizing force

1:05:14.260 --> 1:05:16.300
 that is creating a new financial system

1:05:16.300 --> 1:05:17.940
 that is more fair and more free.

1:05:19.380 --> 1:05:24.380
 Yeah, and in some ways it's a clever way

1:05:24.700 --> 1:05:28.380
 that's enabling people to do that in a novel way.

1:05:28.380 --> 1:05:32.220
 So is Uniswap in some sense a competitive Coinbase?

1:05:32.220 --> 1:05:34.700
 In which way is it and which way is it not?

1:05:34.700 --> 1:05:38.300
 So because for people who don't know,

1:05:38.300 --> 1:05:40.660
 Coinbase is centralized.

1:05:40.660 --> 1:05:45.660
 So let me ask, doesn't that go against the spirit of crypto

1:05:45.920 --> 1:05:49.100
 since crypto is decentralized?

1:05:49.100 --> 1:05:51.940
 What are the pros and cons of being centralized

1:05:51.940 --> 1:05:53.960
 as an exchange?

1:05:53.960 --> 1:05:55.980
 So I don't think Coinbase is fully centralized.

1:05:55.980 --> 1:05:57.340
 We have many different products.

1:05:57.340 --> 1:06:01.100
 And the way that I think about it is that our exchange

1:06:01.100 --> 1:06:03.740
 or our brokerage is a centralized,

1:06:03.740 --> 1:06:06.100
 regulated financial service business.

1:06:06.100 --> 1:06:08.140
 And it's actually important for the crypto ecosystem

1:06:08.140 --> 1:06:11.500
 to have that because you wanna allow a lot of the fiat money

1:06:11.500 --> 1:06:13.380
 in the world to flow into the crypto economy.

1:06:13.380 --> 1:06:15.940
 So we're very proud of that.

1:06:15.940 --> 1:06:18.620
 And I think we've helped a lot of that money flow in.

1:06:18.620 --> 1:06:20.620
 Now, once people have money in crypto,

1:06:20.620 --> 1:06:22.280
 they can choose to hold it in a variety of ways.

1:06:22.280 --> 1:06:24.660
 And they can choose to hold it in a self custodial wallet,

1:06:24.660 --> 1:06:26.240
 which is more decentralized.

1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:29.580
 They can choose to use decentralized exchanges,

1:06:29.580 --> 1:06:32.780
 which we love and Uniswap is not really,

1:06:32.780 --> 1:06:34.920
 I don't think of them as like a direct competitor to us.

1:06:34.920 --> 1:06:37.460
 We basically have integrated Uniswap

1:06:37.460 --> 1:06:38.340
 into a number of our products.

1:06:38.340 --> 1:06:41.460
 We love DeFi, decentralized exchanges, the whole thing.

1:06:41.460 --> 1:06:46.320
 So Coinbase wallet, which is a self custodial wallet,

1:06:46.320 --> 1:06:48.820
 is more decentralized and it allows people

1:06:48.820 --> 1:06:51.500
 to hold their own crypto.

1:06:51.500 --> 1:06:52.500
 They don't have to trust us.

1:06:52.500 --> 1:06:55.860
 Can you explain what a self custodial wallet is?

1:06:55.860 --> 1:06:58.900
 What is a wallet and what is a self custodial wallet?

1:06:58.900 --> 1:07:00.540
 Yeah, so it's confusing.

1:07:00.540 --> 1:07:04.260
 So a custodial wallet means you're trusting Coinbase

1:07:04.260 --> 1:07:08.420
 to store your crypto, the private keys themselves.

1:07:08.420 --> 1:07:11.420
 And for some people and institutions and everything,

1:07:11.420 --> 1:07:12.940
 just meeting them where they are today,

1:07:12.940 --> 1:07:15.480
 that's nice because it's simpler.

1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:18.720
 They're not afraid of losing their crypto

1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:20.660
 if they make some accidental mistake.

1:07:20.660 --> 1:07:25.140
 Or so custodial crypto products are important

1:07:25.140 --> 1:07:27.480
 to help get a bunch of people into the ecosystem.

1:07:27.480 --> 1:07:30.580
 But I'm very supportive of self custodial wallets.

1:07:30.580 --> 1:07:32.500
 And I think in some ways they are the future

1:07:32.500 --> 1:07:34.380
 because more and more people are gonna want

1:07:34.380 --> 1:07:35.340
 to store their own crypto,

1:07:35.340 --> 1:07:37.320
 not trust a third party institution to do it.

1:07:37.320 --> 1:07:38.940
 And in some ways that is much more authentic

1:07:38.940 --> 1:07:40.140
 to the ethos of crypto.

1:07:40.140 --> 1:07:43.700
 So Coinbase will help you convert the fiat into crypto.

1:07:43.700 --> 1:07:46.020
 And frankly, that's a more centralized thing.

1:07:46.020 --> 1:07:46.940
 But once you have crypto,

1:07:46.940 --> 1:07:49.080
 you can then go to the self custodial world,

1:07:49.080 --> 1:07:50.100
 store it yourself.

1:07:50.100 --> 1:07:53.500
 And to get into the technical details just for a second,

1:07:53.500 --> 1:07:56.500
 it's basically saying you're gonna store the keys

1:07:56.500 --> 1:07:57.900
 on your own device.

1:07:57.900 --> 1:08:02.860
 And so even if Coinbase gets some court order to seize it,

1:08:02.860 --> 1:08:03.900
 we actually can't.

1:08:03.900 --> 1:08:06.580
 From an architecture point of view, we can't do it.

1:08:06.580 --> 1:08:08.520
 Or if Coinbase gets hacked or something,

1:08:08.520 --> 1:08:09.960
 we can't lose your funds.

1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:12.300
 Now the thing is you have to take the responsibility

1:08:12.300 --> 1:08:13.140
 because we're not taking it.

1:08:13.140 --> 1:08:15.920
 So the individual person could get hacked.

1:08:15.920 --> 1:08:18.960
 And there's a whole bunch of really cool research happening

1:08:18.960 --> 1:08:21.900
 to make self custodial wallets more resilient

1:08:21.900 --> 1:08:28.060
 to accidental loss, hacks, and just user error.

1:08:28.060 --> 1:08:30.140
 I don't know how much you've looked at various cryptography

1:08:30.140 --> 1:08:35.780
 things, but basically, you can have multiple signatures

1:08:35.780 --> 1:08:37.420
 from different keys on different devices

1:08:37.420 --> 1:08:39.740
 where you need two of the three or three of the five.

1:08:39.740 --> 1:08:43.220
 There's a whole technology called multi party computation

1:08:43.220 --> 1:08:46.460
 or threshold signing signatures, which is really cool.

1:08:46.460 --> 1:08:49.700
 But those are the things you would run locally?

1:08:49.700 --> 1:08:52.460
 These are all security measures, cryptography measures

1:08:52.460 --> 1:08:56.580
 to protect you without a centralized component?

1:08:56.580 --> 1:08:57.100
 Right.

1:08:57.100 --> 1:08:59.180
 So a simple example would be, let's

1:08:59.180 --> 1:09:02.300
 say you had a two of three key signature.

1:09:02.300 --> 1:09:04.820
 And one key might be stored at Coinbase,

1:09:04.820 --> 1:09:06.220
 but that's not a quorum.

1:09:06.220 --> 1:09:08.100
 So we couldn't unilaterally move your funds.

1:09:08.100 --> 1:09:10.100
 But another key is on your device, on your phone,

1:09:10.100 --> 1:09:10.740
 let's say.

1:09:10.740 --> 1:09:12.100
 Oh, cool.

1:09:12.100 --> 1:09:14.920
 So in a normal situation, you have a key on your phone.

1:09:14.920 --> 1:09:17.420
 We have one.

1:09:17.420 --> 1:09:20.060
 And so two out of three, it can all

1:09:20.060 --> 1:09:21.900
 get signed very quickly for day to day use.

1:09:21.900 --> 1:09:23.900
 But let's say you lose your phone or something.

1:09:23.900 --> 1:09:25.420
 Now, there has to be a third key.

1:09:25.420 --> 1:09:29.580
 And that's where you could store it in a backup somewhere,

1:09:29.580 --> 1:09:31.820
 like in Google Drive or iCloud.

1:09:31.820 --> 1:09:34.140
 You could trust a third party that's

1:09:34.140 --> 1:09:36.260
 not Coinbase to also have that one key.

1:09:36.260 --> 1:09:39.180
 And they can't do anything unilaterally with that one key.

1:09:39.180 --> 1:09:40.700
 So that's a simple example.

1:09:40.700 --> 1:09:42.260
 You can get way more complicated.

1:09:42.260 --> 1:09:43.380
 Yeah, that's an awesome idea.

1:09:43.380 --> 1:09:49.820
 So if your funds get seized, Coinbase can't do anything.

1:09:49.820 --> 1:09:52.260
 But you better not lose your phone, maybe, in that case.

1:09:52.260 --> 1:09:54.420
 Yeah, yeah.

1:09:54.420 --> 1:09:56.660
 But it provides a, there is, so even if you lose your phone,

1:09:56.660 --> 1:09:57.820
 then there is a recovery mechanism.

1:09:57.820 --> 1:09:59.140
 Because you can get the one key from Coinbase,

1:09:59.140 --> 1:10:01.500
 the one from your backup provider,

1:10:01.500 --> 1:10:03.860
 and recover a new one back on your phone.

1:10:03.860 --> 1:10:04.620
 I know, yeah.

1:10:04.620 --> 1:10:06.820
 But what if Coinbase is no longer,

1:10:06.820 --> 1:10:09.420
 but because of government, because of, say,

1:10:09.420 --> 1:10:12.620
 it's in North Korea, government says you're no longer,

1:10:12.620 --> 1:10:14.780
 like Coinbase is shut down in that country

1:10:14.780 --> 1:10:15.820
 or something like that.

1:10:15.820 --> 1:10:19.460
 Then you can get it, even if you have access to those two.

1:10:19.460 --> 1:10:23.140
 So again, perhaps a silly question,

1:10:23.140 --> 1:10:26.780
 but isn't a self custodial wallet a competitor

1:10:26.780 --> 1:10:29.860
 as a notion to Coinbase?

1:10:29.860 --> 1:10:33.420
 No, I mean, so we offer a self custodial wallet.

1:10:33.420 --> 1:10:34.820
 We've built one, and it's like one.

1:10:34.820 --> 1:10:37.060
 But doesn't it bleed the, like I guess

1:10:37.060 --> 1:10:39.580
 I'm asking a sort of a financial question,

1:10:39.580 --> 1:10:43.940
 is like how does Coinbase make money on transactions?

1:10:43.940 --> 1:10:47.140
 So does this not, it does not decrease the number,

1:10:47.140 --> 1:10:50.700
 or does not significantly negatively affect transactions?

1:10:50.700 --> 1:10:53.980
 Or are you more focused on growing the number of the pie

1:10:53.980 --> 1:10:56.700
 of the number of people that are using cryptocurrency?

1:10:56.700 --> 1:10:58.580
 Yeah, like a traditional financial service firm

1:10:58.580 --> 1:11:01.740
 would probably say, well, we should be storing,

1:11:01.740 --> 1:11:03.740
 let's keep more of the custody with us,

1:11:03.740 --> 1:11:05.780
 because that's how we prove to the world

1:11:05.780 --> 1:11:07.540
 that we're valuable or whatever.

1:11:07.540 --> 1:11:08.660
 I don't really believe that.

1:11:08.660 --> 1:11:10.980
 Like I think that actually we kind of want to encourage

1:11:10.980 --> 1:11:13.020
 our users to move to self custody over time

1:11:13.020 --> 1:11:15.020
 for those who are ready and willing.

1:11:15.020 --> 1:11:16.660
 And that technology needs to mature.

1:11:16.660 --> 1:11:18.260
 I'm not trying to like force anybody to do it

1:11:18.260 --> 1:11:19.100
 who doesn't want to do it.

1:11:19.100 --> 1:11:21.300
 But to me, that's like the future

1:11:21.300 --> 1:11:23.860
 of how we get billions of people using crypto.

1:11:23.860 --> 1:11:27.420
 But doesn't that mean they can go somewhere else easier?

1:11:27.420 --> 1:11:29.660
 Yeah, that's sort of the point is like,

1:11:29.660 --> 1:11:31.020
 we're all using the same protocol.

1:11:31.020 --> 1:11:32.340
 So there's low switching costs,

1:11:32.340 --> 1:11:34.500
 which keeps all the companies accountable, right?

1:11:34.500 --> 1:11:38.500
 Like if you want to access the visa network,

1:11:38.500 --> 1:11:39.620
 there's only one company in the world

1:11:39.620 --> 1:11:41.740
 you can go through to do that, like visa.

1:11:41.740 --> 1:11:43.500
 But if you want to access the Bitcoin network,

1:11:43.500 --> 1:11:45.780
 there's dozens or hundreds of companies out there

1:11:45.780 --> 1:11:46.620
 who can do that.

1:11:46.620 --> 1:11:50.620
 So it's arguably, you could argue it's worse for us

1:11:50.620 --> 1:11:53.140
 as a company, but I think it's better for,

1:11:53.140 --> 1:11:54.540
 it's what makes Bitcoin interesting

1:11:54.540 --> 1:11:58.020
 and cryptocurrency interesting is that nobody controls it.

1:11:58.020 --> 1:11:59.940
 There is low switching costs for customers.

1:11:59.940 --> 1:12:01.180
 It's better for customers.

1:12:01.180 --> 1:12:03.260
 And that means that all the companies in the space

1:12:03.260 --> 1:12:04.500
 are going to be held to a high standard

1:12:04.500 --> 1:12:06.060
 because the minute you lose someone's trust,

1:12:06.060 --> 1:12:08.500
 they're just going to move their Bitcoin to some other service

1:12:08.500 --> 1:12:10.220
 and that's good for the world.

1:12:10.220 --> 1:12:12.500
 Do you think of Coinbase as,

1:12:12.500 --> 1:12:14.300
 so there's these ideas of layer one,

1:12:14.300 --> 1:12:17.060
 layer two, layer three technologies.

1:12:17.060 --> 1:12:20.020
 Do you think of Coinbase as layer one,

1:12:20.020 --> 1:12:21.700
 layer two, layer three?

1:12:21.700 --> 1:12:25.180
 Now that said, there's so many products

1:12:27.180 --> 1:12:28.740
 that are under the Coinbase umbrella

1:12:28.740 --> 1:12:30.100
 that it's hard to answer that question,

1:12:30.100 --> 1:12:31.940
 but what do you think?

1:12:31.940 --> 1:12:34.340
 Do you acknowledge the existence of layer three?

1:12:34.340 --> 1:12:38.860
 So, you know, usually when people are using those terms,

1:12:38.860 --> 1:12:40.580
 layer one, layer two, so they're referring to like,

1:12:40.580 --> 1:12:42.940
 layer one would be the blockchain,

1:12:42.940 --> 1:12:43.820
 layer one blockchain itself,

1:12:43.820 --> 1:12:45.780
 like a Bitcoin or Ethereum or something,

1:12:45.780 --> 1:12:48.140
 not like a centralized service like Coinbase

1:12:48.140 --> 1:12:51.740
 or even our decentralized self custodial wallet.

1:12:51.740 --> 1:12:56.460
 So yeah, I wouldn't consider us to be like a layer one.

1:12:56.460 --> 1:12:58.540
 These are the decentralized protocols

1:12:58.540 --> 1:13:01.740
 that we're integrating, but Coinbase itself is not those.

1:13:01.740 --> 1:13:05.180
 Yes, but layer two is the thing that was basically

1:13:05.180 --> 1:13:09.180
 doing transactions without the settlement on the blockchain.

1:13:09.180 --> 1:13:11.180
 And so you get to have some of the benefits

1:13:11.180 --> 1:13:15.220
 of faster transactions without the security

1:13:15.220 --> 1:13:16.420
 associated with the blockchain.

1:13:16.420 --> 1:13:20.300
 And layer three is, I suppose,

1:13:20.300 --> 1:13:23.060
 sort of apps built on top of that.

1:13:23.060 --> 1:13:26.860
 So, you know, at least I think talking to Michael Saylor,

1:13:26.860 --> 1:13:29.940
 he considers Coinbase a layer three technology.

1:13:29.940 --> 1:13:31.180
 Interesting, okay.

1:13:31.180 --> 1:13:34.460
 I'm not really particularly familiar

1:13:34.460 --> 1:13:37.460
 with this kind of distinction of layer three and two.

1:13:37.460 --> 1:13:40.340
 I don't see them as fundamentally different.

1:13:40.340 --> 1:13:43.860
 But some of the, okay, I mean, one way of asking that,

1:13:44.700 --> 1:13:48.180
 is there some layer two like of magic happening

1:13:48.180 --> 1:13:50.220
 in order to make transactions associated

1:13:50.220 --> 1:13:55.220
 with the blockchain happen instant, so that they're quick?

1:13:55.460 --> 1:13:56.300
 So that.

1:13:56.300 --> 1:13:57.140
 On Coinbase?

1:13:57.140 --> 1:13:57.980
 On Coinbase, yeah.

1:13:58.860 --> 1:14:00.140
 Is there some magic going on?

1:14:00.140 --> 1:14:01.820
 Because you're, okay, we should say,

1:14:01.820 --> 1:14:04.980
 how many cryptocurrencies are currently on Coinbase?

1:14:04.980 --> 1:14:06.420
 So it's more than two.

1:14:06.420 --> 1:14:07.580
 Yeah.

1:14:07.580 --> 1:14:08.500
 It's a lot more than two.

1:14:08.500 --> 1:14:09.340
 Yeah.

1:14:09.340 --> 1:14:10.500
 So you have to understand,

1:14:10.500 --> 1:14:12.580
 they have to incorporate all these technologies.

1:14:12.580 --> 1:14:13.900
 Yeah.

1:14:13.900 --> 1:14:16.140
 So how do you make that magic

1:14:16.140 --> 1:14:18.820
 of sort of universal transactions happen

1:14:18.820 --> 1:14:21.260
 across all of these different cryptocurrencies?

1:14:23.260 --> 1:14:24.580
 There's our centralized products

1:14:24.580 --> 1:14:25.860
 and decentralized products, right?

1:14:25.860 --> 1:14:30.860
 The centralized products, we are storing that crypto for you.

1:14:31.100 --> 1:14:33.460
 And so if you're moving from one of your accounts

1:14:33.460 --> 1:14:36.100
 to another account, like an ETH1 account to ETH2 account,

1:14:36.100 --> 1:14:39.860
 or from my ETH Coinbase centralized account

1:14:39.860 --> 1:14:40.700
 to your ETH centralized.

1:14:40.700 --> 1:14:43.580
 So we can do that transaction off chain to make it faster.

1:14:43.580 --> 1:14:45.420
 And it saves the customer fees

1:14:45.420 --> 1:14:47.020
 and it just confirms instantly.

1:14:47.020 --> 1:14:49.180
 But it's not truly using the decentralized blockchain,

1:14:49.180 --> 1:14:50.020
 right?

1:14:50.020 --> 1:14:52.260
 So you can also send any Bitcoin address

1:14:52.260 --> 1:14:53.940
 or Ethereum address, for instance.

1:14:53.940 --> 1:14:56.420
 And that is putting the transaction on chain.

1:14:56.420 --> 1:14:59.300
 Now our decentralized products like Coinbase wallet,

1:14:59.300 --> 1:15:01.020
 the self custodial wallet,

1:15:01.020 --> 1:15:03.580
 every transaction is happening on chain with that.

1:15:03.580 --> 1:15:05.700
 And so basically it just shows a little bit

1:15:05.700 --> 1:15:07.980
 of the evolution of Coinbase and the blockchains themselves.

1:15:07.980 --> 1:15:12.980
 Like in the early days, these networks were not scalable.

1:15:13.220 --> 1:15:16.820
 And so there were no L2 solutions, for instance.

1:15:16.820 --> 1:15:18.540
 And so we had to do sort of these hacks,

1:15:18.540 --> 1:15:20.140
 like moving the crypto off chain,

1:15:20.140 --> 1:15:21.540
 if you were moving between your own accounts

1:15:21.540 --> 1:15:22.460
 and stuff like that.

1:15:22.460 --> 1:15:24.580
 Otherwise the minor fees would have just eaten us alive

1:15:24.580 --> 1:15:25.780
 as a company, right?

1:15:25.780 --> 1:15:26.620
 Yeah.

1:15:26.620 --> 1:15:29.020
 But now the blockchains are starting to scale.

1:15:29.020 --> 1:15:29.940
 There's a whole bunch of more work

1:15:29.940 --> 1:15:30.780
 that needs to be done on that.

1:15:30.780 --> 1:15:32.260
 And we're getting L2 solutions.

1:15:32.260 --> 1:15:33.820
 So I think more and more of the transactions

1:15:33.820 --> 1:15:36.620
 are going on chain, whether it's L2, L1.

1:15:36.620 --> 1:15:41.620
 And ideally we shouldn't be doing that many transactions

1:15:43.820 --> 1:15:47.060
 off chain, just internal Coinbase ledger or something.

1:15:47.060 --> 1:15:48.740
 That's not really in the spirit of crypto.

1:15:48.740 --> 1:15:53.740
 So when you say on chain, that includes layer two technology

1:15:54.900 --> 1:15:56.740
 that the blockchain proposes.

1:15:56.740 --> 1:15:57.580
 Yeah.

1:15:59.580 --> 1:16:02.500
 I guess I was asking how much fun magic is happening

1:16:02.500 --> 1:16:04.380
 off chain within Coinbase.

1:16:04.380 --> 1:16:07.300
 And you're saying in the early days you had to,

1:16:07.300 --> 1:16:09.620
 but you're trying to do less and less.

1:16:09.620 --> 1:16:11.620
 So look, there's a bunch of high frequency traders

1:16:11.620 --> 1:16:13.180
 that use the centralized products

1:16:13.180 --> 1:16:15.620
 and even just regular retail people,

1:16:15.620 --> 1:16:17.660
 they don't want to pay the gas fees and stuff.

1:16:17.660 --> 1:16:19.340
 And they're trying to, it actually,

1:16:19.340 --> 1:16:24.180
 we back at the envelope, calculated this out at one point

1:16:24.180 --> 1:16:26.780
 and just like, it would be completely infeasible

1:16:26.780 --> 1:16:28.140
 for like high frequency traders

1:16:28.140 --> 1:16:29.780
 to put everything on chain at this point.

1:16:29.780 --> 1:16:31.460
 That's basically what DEXs are doing.

1:16:31.460 --> 1:16:33.660
 And so both are important.

1:16:33.660 --> 1:16:35.700
 I think more and more is going to move decentralized

1:16:35.700 --> 1:16:36.900
 over time, which is great.

1:16:36.900 --> 1:16:38.340
 And we're, and we're basically.

1:16:38.340 --> 1:16:40.340
 DEXs are decentralized exchanges by the way.

1:16:40.340 --> 1:16:41.180
 Yeah.

1:16:42.820 --> 1:16:45.460
 So anyway, we want to encourage more and more of it

1:16:45.460 --> 1:16:46.860
 to move decentralized over time,

1:16:46.860 --> 1:16:48.780
 but I don't, the centralized things aren't going away

1:16:48.780 --> 1:16:50.220
 for like a long time.

1:16:50.220 --> 1:16:51.340
 It's a decade from now,

1:16:51.340 --> 1:16:54.340
 there's going to be some big institution

1:16:54.340 --> 1:16:56.660
 or pension fund or central bank.

1:16:56.660 --> 1:16:58.940
 That's like, all right, we got to hold crypto.

1:16:58.940 --> 1:17:00.740
 Let's set up the account in a centralized way.

1:17:00.740 --> 1:17:02.020
 So that's, that's fine.

1:17:02.020 --> 1:17:03.220
 Both, both are important.

1:17:03.220 --> 1:17:04.460
 Do you know the number

1:17:04.460 --> 1:17:07.300
 of cryptocurrencies currently on Coinbase?

1:17:07.300 --> 1:17:08.180
 Do you know that number?

1:17:08.180 --> 1:17:10.660
 It's over a hundred, but it depends.

1:17:10.660 --> 1:17:12.260
 It depends what jurisdiction you're in.

1:17:12.260 --> 1:17:16.260
 And, you know, are you in institution versus retail?

1:17:16.260 --> 1:17:19.020
 There's like, there's so many different categories now.

1:17:19.020 --> 1:17:20.180
 But over a hundred.

1:17:20.180 --> 1:17:21.660
 Yeah.

1:17:21.660 --> 1:17:25.860
 So what does it take to become, to, to, to become an asset,

1:17:25.860 --> 1:17:28.260
 to become a cryptocurrency on Coinbase,

1:17:28.260 --> 1:17:32.300
 to add your technology to Coinbase?

1:17:33.340 --> 1:17:36.500
 Okay. Well, so we're trying to get away from this idea

1:17:36.500 --> 1:17:39.300
 of being listed on Coinbase as being seen as like

1:17:39.300 --> 1:17:40.500
 an endorsement or something,

1:17:40.500 --> 1:17:42.740
 because I actually think it's very important

1:17:42.740 --> 1:17:47.740
 that we are not considered judge and jury about, you know,

1:17:47.780 --> 1:17:49.460
 like imagine it was the early days of the internet

1:17:49.460 --> 1:17:50.700
 and you were like, what's a good webpage

1:17:50.700 --> 1:17:51.540
 and what's a bad webpage.

1:17:51.540 --> 1:17:52.740
 Like you would have been totally wrong

1:17:52.740 --> 1:17:57.140
 or anytime big tech companies try to make these review,

1:17:57.140 --> 1:17:58.860
 review boards of like, you know,

1:17:58.860 --> 1:18:00.500
 Apple famously gets in trouble for this a lot

1:18:00.500 --> 1:18:02.060
 with their app store review process.

1:18:02.060 --> 1:18:02.900
 Right.

1:18:02.900 --> 1:18:06.180
 And so something that you think like a committee of people

1:18:06.180 --> 1:18:08.060
 somewhere thinks looks silly may turn out

1:18:08.060 --> 1:18:08.940
 to be the next big thing.

1:18:08.940 --> 1:18:10.660
 Right. And so it's very difficult.

1:18:10.660 --> 1:18:11.500
 So what do we do?

1:18:11.500 --> 1:18:15.020
 We basically have a test of legality, right?

1:18:15.020 --> 1:18:19.780
 We check, you know, do we believe this is a security?

1:18:19.780 --> 1:18:21.620
 If so, it can't be listed on Coinbase

1:18:21.620 --> 1:18:25.060
 and there's a very rigorous process we go through for that.

1:18:25.060 --> 1:18:26.620
 Just currently the way the laws are in the US,

1:18:26.620 --> 1:18:27.900
 you can't do that.

1:18:27.900 --> 1:18:30.180
 And we've been, we acquired a broker duo license

1:18:30.180 --> 1:18:31.020
 from the SEC.

1:18:31.020 --> 1:18:32.820
 We're trying to work with them to get that operational

1:18:32.820 --> 1:18:35.260
 and hopefully someday we can trade real crypto securities.

1:18:35.260 --> 1:18:37.820
 But today that's not possible in the US at least.

1:18:38.860 --> 1:18:40.900
 Then we look at sort of the cybersecurity

1:18:40.900 --> 1:18:42.500
 of the crypto asset.

1:18:42.500 --> 1:18:44.260
 Does it, do we see that there's some flaw

1:18:44.260 --> 1:18:47.060
 in the smart contract or, you know,

1:18:47.060 --> 1:18:49.340
 a way that somebody could manipulate it

1:18:49.340 --> 1:18:51.260
 without the customer's permission?

1:18:52.500 --> 1:18:54.700
 We look at some compliance pieces to it as well,

1:18:54.700 --> 1:18:57.540
 like the actors behind it and like, you know,

1:18:57.540 --> 1:19:00.100
 there any kind of criminal history, anything like that.

1:19:00.100 --> 1:19:02.980
 But if we believe it meets our listing standards,

1:19:02.980 --> 1:19:06.260
 basically this test of legality and everything

1:19:06.260 --> 1:19:09.460
 for customer protection, then we want to list it

1:19:09.460 --> 1:19:11.620
 because we want the market to at that point decide.

1:19:11.620 --> 1:19:16.100
 And it's kind of like Amazon or something like that

1:19:16.100 --> 1:19:18.860
 where, you know, a product might have three stars

1:19:18.860 --> 1:19:19.900
 or it might have five stars,

1:19:19.900 --> 1:19:22.420
 but if it starts to get one star consistently,

1:19:22.420 --> 1:19:24.620
 like it's probably a fraudulent or it's defective

1:19:24.620 --> 1:19:26.660
 or something like maybe Amazon will remove it.

1:19:26.660 --> 1:19:29.060
 But otherwise you want to let the market decide

1:19:29.060 --> 1:19:30.140
 what these things are.

1:19:31.340 --> 1:19:32.900
 So that's generally how we do it.

1:19:32.900 --> 1:19:36.180
 And by the way, more and more of these assets,

1:19:36.180 --> 1:19:38.380
 I think especially like low market cap assets

1:19:38.380 --> 1:19:40.500
 are going to be traded on DEXs through Coinbase.

1:19:40.500 --> 1:19:41.620
 It's not that we,

1:19:42.820 --> 1:19:45.220
 we don't need to list every asset on a centralized exchange.

1:19:45.220 --> 1:19:47.780
 I think DEXs are really good for the long tail.

1:19:47.780 --> 1:19:49.620
 And then it becomes an even,

1:19:49.620 --> 1:19:50.860
 it's even more clear to people,

1:19:50.860 --> 1:19:53.980
 like this is not some endorsement by a Coinbase of like,

1:19:53.980 --> 1:19:55.380
 this asset's good and this one's bad.

1:19:55.380 --> 1:19:57.900
 Like, you know, my belief is there's going to be millions

1:19:57.900 --> 1:19:59.020
 of these assets over time.

1:19:59.020 --> 1:20:02.380
 And so I hope it doesn't like make news

1:20:02.380 --> 1:20:03.780
 every time we add one in the future, basically.

1:20:03.780 --> 1:20:05.980
 Yeah, I wonder how you get there

1:20:05.980 --> 1:20:10.580
 because I, even I look to Coinbase for, for example,

1:20:10.580 --> 1:20:13.020
 you know, people, as you can imagine,

1:20:13.020 --> 1:20:15.340
 sort of tag me on Twitter or something like that

1:20:15.340 --> 1:20:20.340
 and all that, like you should interview our sort of this,

1:20:20.580 --> 1:20:23.140
 the founder of this particular coin, right?

1:20:23.140 --> 1:20:23.980
 Yeah.

1:20:23.980 --> 1:20:27.340
 And I, it's so hard for me to know what's,

1:20:27.340 --> 1:20:29.540
 first of all, what's interesting technology?

1:20:30.540 --> 1:20:34.780
 What's, who's a scammer or not?

1:20:34.780 --> 1:20:37.340
 Who's actually legitimately representing

1:20:37.340 --> 1:20:42.340
 an ambitious new thing versus a scam?

1:20:43.340 --> 1:20:46.180
 And I, you know, there's very few sources

1:20:46.180 --> 1:20:50.540
 of like a verification signal.

1:20:50.540 --> 1:20:52.780
 And unfortunately Coinbase in part

1:20:52.780 --> 1:20:55.580
 has become a little bit of that too.

1:20:55.580 --> 1:20:57.500
 And you're trying to get away from that

1:20:57.500 --> 1:20:58.740
 because you're trying to get as many,

1:20:58.740 --> 1:21:00.740
 sort of let the people decide.

1:21:00.740 --> 1:21:03.940
 So you're thinking of like Amazon star type system

1:21:03.940 --> 1:21:05.660
 where the people could rate.

1:21:05.660 --> 1:21:07.380
 Yeah, so I think we'll actually probably add

1:21:07.380 --> 1:21:09.060
 like user ratings and reviews.

1:21:09.060 --> 1:21:12.660
 So, and we'll be very cautious about like, you know,

1:21:12.660 --> 1:21:13.860
 these are real people.

1:21:15.340 --> 1:21:17.340
 There's a bunch of stuff we have to do for that already.

1:21:17.340 --> 1:21:19.820
 So I think wisdom of the crowds is good

1:21:19.820 --> 1:21:21.940
 in terms of getting feedback on items,

1:21:21.940 --> 1:21:24.180
 but we also, we're gonna do our own review,

1:21:24.180 --> 1:21:25.180
 which I mentioned earlier, right?

1:21:25.180 --> 1:21:27.620
 Which is like, okay, it meets this minimum bar

1:21:27.620 --> 1:21:28.700
 to be listed on our site.

1:21:28.700 --> 1:21:29.540
 Yeah.

1:21:30.500 --> 1:21:32.180
 I think, yeah, both are important.

1:21:32.180 --> 1:21:35.300
 How do you know if a coin is a scam or not?

1:21:36.580 --> 1:21:39.100
 Well, you can see a few things.

1:21:39.100 --> 1:21:41.140
 So, you know, I hate to use the word scam

1:21:41.140 --> 1:21:42.580
 because a lot of these are judgment calls.

1:21:42.580 --> 1:21:45.140
 You gotta, I kind of, a court may or a jury

1:21:45.140 --> 1:21:45.980
 may land either way,

1:21:45.980 --> 1:21:48.980
 but things that would be red flags to look at would be,

1:21:50.060 --> 1:21:53.620
 you know, is a bunch of the asset owned by an insider

1:21:53.620 --> 1:21:56.820
 or insiders with short vesting periods.

1:21:56.820 --> 1:22:01.820
 You know, does the background of the founders,

1:22:02.940 --> 1:22:04.820
 like they may have criminal records

1:22:04.820 --> 1:22:08.260
 or if they've perpetrated other frauds in the past, right?

1:22:08.260 --> 1:22:10.460
 There's a difference between something

1:22:10.460 --> 1:22:13.900
 which is just a me too product.

1:22:13.900 --> 1:22:16.100
 It's like, it doesn't have anything interesting about it

1:22:16.100 --> 1:22:18.220
 and something that's an actual fraud or outright scam.

1:22:18.220 --> 1:22:21.300
 And you have to, a lot of this data,

1:22:21.300 --> 1:22:23.540
 what's cool about it is that it's now available on chain.

1:22:23.540 --> 1:22:25.500
 You can look at like the tokenomics behind it

1:22:25.500 --> 1:22:26.340
 and see who owns it.

1:22:26.340 --> 1:22:31.340
 And are they selling it, you know, in like inappropriately

1:22:32.740 --> 1:22:35.900
 or are they pumping it on like YouTube and Twitter

1:22:35.900 --> 1:22:38.140
 and making promises about,

1:22:38.140 --> 1:22:40.260
 hey, the value of this thing may be a higher in the future.

1:22:40.260 --> 1:22:42.220
 And like, all those are just big, big no, no's

1:22:42.220 --> 1:22:45.860
 that we would, you know, we just don't wanna go there.

1:22:45.860 --> 1:22:48.220
 So our whole thing is like,

1:22:48.220 --> 1:22:50.900
 we want to enable innovation in this space,

1:22:50.900 --> 1:22:54.620
 but not allow anybody to curtail the advancement

1:22:54.620 --> 1:22:57.380
 of this industry by like doing some kind of fraudulent thing

1:22:57.380 --> 1:22:58.420
 or get rich quick thing.

1:22:58.420 --> 1:22:59.260
 So.

1:22:59.260 --> 1:23:00.100
 It's a tricky industry

1:23:00.100 --> 1:23:02.700
 because I'm trying to figure out who to, you know,

1:23:03.780 --> 1:23:07.820
 what's interesting to understand, to research.

1:23:07.820 --> 1:23:09.860
 And it's hard to know.

1:23:09.860 --> 1:23:11.780
 Let me ask you about a tricky one

1:23:11.780 --> 1:23:13.460
 to add to a centralized exchange,

1:23:13.460 --> 1:23:16.300
 which is privacy preserving cryptocurrency.

1:23:16.300 --> 1:23:17.420
 So like Monero.

1:23:17.420 --> 1:23:18.260
 Yeah.

1:23:18.260 --> 1:23:21.700
 Is that technically difficult or is that why,

1:23:21.700 --> 1:23:24.580
 why is like Monero, for example, forget that specific one,

1:23:24.580 --> 1:23:29.580
 but like privacy preserving cryptocurrency blockchains,

1:23:29.860 --> 1:23:32.260
 why is that, is that ever possible to add?

1:23:33.340 --> 1:23:35.100
 So that's a great question.

1:23:35.100 --> 1:23:36.220
 So the answer is maybe.

1:23:36.220 --> 1:23:40.300
 So here's the reason why.

1:23:40.300 --> 1:23:43.700
 So because we're a regulated financial service business,

1:23:43.700 --> 1:23:46.300
 we have various licenses to do that.

1:23:46.300 --> 1:23:48.500
 We are regulated by various regulators.

1:23:48.500 --> 1:23:51.060
 Part of those licenses requires us to have a quote,

1:23:51.060 --> 1:23:56.060
 reasonable program to monitor for suspicious activity,

1:23:57.260 --> 1:23:59.660
 you know, an AML program, anti money laundering, right?

1:23:59.660 --> 1:24:03.860
 And so if it, if a coin is a hundred percent anonymous

1:24:03.860 --> 1:24:05.540
 and we can't really do blockchain analytics

1:24:05.540 --> 1:24:07.820
 to track source of funds

1:24:07.820 --> 1:24:09.700
 and where these things might be going,

1:24:09.700 --> 1:24:14.700
 it makes it harder to have a reasonable program around that

1:24:15.100 --> 1:24:16.020
 that's defensible.

1:24:16.020 --> 1:24:19.420
 Now there are privacy preserving coins like Zcash,

1:24:19.420 --> 1:24:21.220
 which have something called a view key.

1:24:21.220 --> 1:24:23.300
 And a view key is basically another key

1:24:23.300 --> 1:24:26.060
 which allows you to deanonymize the transactions

1:24:26.060 --> 1:24:28.100
 in specific situations where you want that.

1:24:28.100 --> 1:24:30.820
 So for instance, you know, we do support Zcash.

1:24:30.820 --> 1:24:32.420
 And one of the ways we got comfortable with that

1:24:32.420 --> 1:24:35.180
 is that when you're buying it on Coinbase,

1:24:36.140 --> 1:24:38.380
 you know, you can basically have a view key.

1:24:38.380 --> 1:24:41.100
 The transactions are not anonymous while you're buying it.

1:24:41.100 --> 1:24:42.660
 And we can see where it goes afterwards

1:24:42.660 --> 1:24:44.420
 and do our whole standard program.

1:24:45.420 --> 1:24:48.020
 Now, if it gets a few hops away down the road,

1:24:48.020 --> 1:24:50.100
 I mean, people could eventually turn on

1:24:50.100 --> 1:24:51.820
 privacy preserving aspects.

1:24:51.820 --> 1:24:53.860
 So, you know, these are tough judgment calls,

1:24:53.860 --> 1:24:55.780
 but at least in terms of our interaction

1:24:55.780 --> 1:24:56.940
 with the customer and everything,

1:24:56.940 --> 1:24:58.580
 we feel comfortable at that.

1:24:58.580 --> 1:25:00.380
 I think there's a broader point here,

1:25:00.380 --> 1:25:03.260
 which is that I actually think privacy coins

1:25:03.260 --> 1:25:05.780
 are a good thing for the world and they should be allowed.

1:25:05.780 --> 1:25:08.500
 And more like, you know, despite,

1:25:08.500 --> 1:25:10.380
 we've made this judgment call to operate

1:25:10.380 --> 1:25:11.900
 in a regulated and safe and compliant way,

1:25:11.900 --> 1:25:15.220
 but just taking my Coinbase hat off for a minute,

1:25:15.220 --> 1:25:17.620
 I think the world would be a better place

1:25:17.620 --> 1:25:19.100
 if there were more privacy coins,

1:25:19.100 --> 1:25:20.780
 because it's kind of like the internet

1:25:20.780 --> 1:25:24.300
 when it first came online, like there was no HTTPS,

1:25:24.300 --> 1:25:26.620
 everything was HTTP and there was, you know,

1:25:26.620 --> 1:25:28.140
 so people were afraid to put their credit cards

1:25:28.140 --> 1:25:31.580
 on the internet and your messages could be intercepted

1:25:31.580 --> 1:25:32.420
 and all this stuff.

1:25:32.420 --> 1:25:34.540
 And now the whole internet has basically moved to HTTPS

1:25:34.540 --> 1:25:37.380
 with a little lock icon in your browser, which is better.

1:25:37.380 --> 1:25:39.260
 Like, and financial information

1:25:39.260 --> 1:25:41.500
 is like the most important information to keep private,

1:25:41.500 --> 1:25:42.620
 right?

1:25:42.620 --> 1:25:44.420
 So there's times where like,

1:25:44.420 --> 1:25:46.060
 let's say you're running a charity or something

1:25:46.060 --> 1:25:47.940
 and you want to have total auditability,

1:25:47.940 --> 1:25:49.700
 transparency for the whole world,

1:25:49.700 --> 1:25:51.300
 who donated and where did the money go?

1:25:51.300 --> 1:25:53.220
 That's great, you want it to be public.

1:25:53.220 --> 1:25:56.100
 But if it's like your personal money or something like that,

1:25:56.100 --> 1:25:58.100
 you don't want to be broadcasting that to the whole world.

1:25:58.100 --> 1:26:00.620
 And in some ways that's what blockchains are doing,

1:26:00.620 --> 1:26:01.900
 you know, pseudonymously,

1:26:01.900 --> 1:26:03.740
 because like, but it is a public ledger.

1:26:03.740 --> 1:26:05.780
 And so if you can know who owns each address,

1:26:05.780 --> 1:26:07.780
 you can basically deanonymize it.

1:26:07.780 --> 1:26:11.500
 I, you know, I think basically people should fight

1:26:11.500 --> 1:26:13.980
 for privacy and freedoms of all kinds,

1:26:13.980 --> 1:26:16.020
 but privacy of money is a good thing.

1:26:16.020 --> 1:26:17.540
 So I would like to see more of that in the future.

1:26:17.540 --> 1:26:22.540
 You chosen with Coinbase to have a seat at the table

1:26:23.700 --> 1:26:25.140
 with the regulators.

1:26:25.140 --> 1:26:30.140
 So what kind of conversations are there at that table?

1:26:31.380 --> 1:26:33.500
 What are the regulations like?

1:26:33.500 --> 1:26:36.860
 What is the level of understanding with regulators?

1:26:36.860 --> 1:26:38.140
 What are they worried about?

1:26:38.140 --> 1:26:39.260
 What are they thinking about?

1:26:39.260 --> 1:26:42.900
 What are the positive and what are the negative regulations

1:26:42.900 --> 1:26:44.580
 that you're facing?

1:26:44.580 --> 1:26:48.060
 That you're educating, struggling with, pushing back on,

1:26:48.060 --> 1:26:49.780
 supporting, all that kind of stuff.

1:26:49.780 --> 1:26:51.220
 Yeah.

1:26:51.220 --> 1:26:52.140
 Oh man, there's so many.

1:26:52.140 --> 1:26:55.540
 Cause we're, I mean, we're live in like, you know,

1:26:55.540 --> 1:26:56.980
 maybe a hundred countries or more at this point.

1:26:56.980 --> 1:26:59.900
 So the conversations are all over the map.

1:26:59.900 --> 1:27:02.020
 I'm trying to think what broad strokes I could paint for you.

1:27:02.020 --> 1:27:06.380
 So I'd say one trend that's positive is that basically

1:27:06.380 --> 1:27:09.140
 regulators around the world are more and more,

1:27:09.140 --> 1:27:11.460
 over the last five years, I would say,

1:27:11.460 --> 1:27:15.780
 it's more and more common to find a regulator today asking,

1:27:15.780 --> 1:27:17.740
 how can we preserve the innovation potential

1:27:17.740 --> 1:27:21.140
 of this technology while keeping the bad actors out

1:27:21.140 --> 1:27:23.500
 than it was five years ago, where they were saying,

1:27:23.500 --> 1:27:24.500
 this is all bad activity.

1:27:24.500 --> 1:27:25.700
 How do we prevent it?

1:27:25.700 --> 1:27:28.500
 And so maybe this is.

1:27:28.500 --> 1:27:32.460
 When you say more and more, what fraction?

1:27:34.340 --> 1:27:36.500
 I'll give you like a US specific example,

1:27:36.500 --> 1:27:38.180
 although we operate in many countries.

1:27:38.180 --> 1:27:42.580
 So when I go to DC now, I would say, you know,

1:27:42.580 --> 1:27:46.620
 50, 60% of the people who I meet with are basically,

1:27:46.620 --> 1:27:49.020
 you know, they're in the camp of crypto,

1:27:49.020 --> 1:27:50.260
 has a lot of potential.

1:27:50.260 --> 1:27:52.300
 We should regulate it to make sure the bad people

1:27:52.300 --> 1:27:53.540
 don't do something bad with it.

1:27:53.540 --> 1:27:56.220
 But this is here to stay and it has a lot of upside.

1:27:56.220 --> 1:27:59.340
 We should basically create the awful regulation

1:27:59.340 --> 1:28:01.980
 and celebrate it and actually encourage this innovation

1:28:01.980 --> 1:28:03.180
 to happen in the US.

1:28:03.180 --> 1:28:06.580
 That's a huge change from just three years ago

1:28:06.580 --> 1:28:08.380
 where it was probably 30% of people saying that.

1:28:08.380 --> 1:28:10.420
 Now it's like 60, it's like almost double.

1:28:10.420 --> 1:28:13.340
 It's getting harder to find like true crypto skeptics

1:28:13.340 --> 1:28:15.860
 in DC.

1:28:15.860 --> 1:28:19.580
 I'd say that, you know, maybe only like 20 or 30% of people

1:28:19.580 --> 1:28:21.900
 are like willing to say something negative.

1:28:21.900 --> 1:28:23.580
 Like they actually think it's net negative.

1:28:23.580 --> 1:28:25.660
 It's like, it's really hard to defend that position

1:28:25.660 --> 1:28:28.660
 at this point, because almost like one in five Americans

1:28:28.660 --> 1:28:30.100
 have used or tried crypto at this point.

1:28:30.100 --> 1:28:32.940
 So you're kind of condemning 20% of your fellow citizens

1:28:32.940 --> 1:28:36.020
 if you say that at this point, you know,

1:28:36.020 --> 1:28:37.260
 especially with NFTs and all these things,

1:28:37.260 --> 1:28:39.180
 like a huge segment of people who don't even care

1:28:39.180 --> 1:28:41.580
 about investing or whatever came into the space.

1:28:41.580 --> 1:28:45.420
 So, and then basically that's that same conversation

1:28:45.420 --> 1:28:49.460
 is happening, but, you know, delayed by a few years

1:28:49.460 --> 1:28:53.140
 in like India and Europe and in some Asian countries.

1:28:53.140 --> 1:28:56.260
 And some countries have really embraced crypto

1:28:56.260 --> 1:28:58.140
 and they're like trying to really,

1:28:59.660 --> 1:29:00.940
 they're ahead of where the US is

1:29:00.940 --> 1:29:03.340
 because they're trying to actually attract

1:29:03.340 --> 1:29:06.260
 the best startups and entrepreneurs like, you know, like Dubai

1:29:06.260 --> 1:29:08.060
 and UK and Australia and all are kind of pushing

1:29:08.060 --> 1:29:11.500
 good regulation, El Salvador actually, I guess,

1:29:11.500 --> 1:29:13.540
 adopted it as like Bitcoin as a legal tender.

1:29:13.540 --> 1:29:15.580
 There was another country, Central African Republic,

1:29:15.580 --> 1:29:18.220
 I think that is supposedly did that as well.

1:29:18.220 --> 1:29:20.540
 But, you know, there's countries like China

1:29:20.540 --> 1:29:22.140
 that are more autocratic that are saying,

1:29:22.140 --> 1:29:24.580
 hey, this is a threat to our power

1:29:24.580 --> 1:29:26.420
 and like, we're gonna try to really curtail it.

1:29:26.420 --> 1:29:30.700
 So what kind of regulations are there that you feel the most

1:29:30.700 --> 1:29:33.260
 that are limiting or that are empowering?

1:29:33.260 --> 1:29:35.300
 Like, is there specific examples?

1:29:35.300 --> 1:29:36.140
 Yeah, okay.

1:29:36.140 --> 1:29:39.300
 So, I mean, basically I think the securities laws

1:29:39.300 --> 1:29:44.420
 in the US need to be clarified about what,

1:29:44.420 --> 1:29:45.620
 crypto is many different things.

1:29:45.620 --> 1:29:46.620
 That's what people don't realize.

1:29:46.620 --> 1:29:49.700
 So like some crypto, like Bitcoin, Ethereum

1:29:49.700 --> 1:29:53.180
 and many others are probably more like commodities.

1:29:53.180 --> 1:29:55.300
 They're not controlled by any one person, you know,

1:29:55.300 --> 1:29:58.180
 like anyway, there's people who wanna raise money

1:29:58.180 --> 1:30:00.320
 for a company that's sounds more like a security

1:30:00.320 --> 1:30:02.420
 that should be regulated by the SEC.

1:30:02.420 --> 1:30:04.540
 Commodities are regulated by the CFTC.

1:30:04.540 --> 1:30:06.420
 Then there's some cryptocurrencies

1:30:06.420 --> 1:30:08.300
 which are more like currencies,

1:30:08.300 --> 1:30:10.800
 like stable coins and central bank digital currencies.

1:30:10.800 --> 1:30:12.900
 And those are probably, you know,

1:30:12.900 --> 1:30:15.180
 should be regulated by the treasury or someone like that.

1:30:15.180 --> 1:30:16.620
 And then there's a whole another category

1:30:16.620 --> 1:30:18.380
 of cryptocurrencies, which are none of those things.

1:30:18.380 --> 1:30:21.760
 They're NFTs like artwork or they're metaverse items

1:30:21.760 --> 1:30:23.620
 or decentralized identity and voting.

1:30:23.620 --> 1:30:28.620
 And so I think that there's a very unhelpful point of view

1:30:28.620 --> 1:30:31.180
 out there by some folks, which is,

1:30:31.180 --> 1:30:34.420
 hey, this is all, most of this is like bad activity.

1:30:34.420 --> 1:30:35.860
 We need to shut it down.

1:30:35.860 --> 1:30:38.020
 So we're just gonna pursue enforcement actions

1:30:38.020 --> 1:30:39.100
 or something like that.

1:30:39.100 --> 1:30:41.140
 Most people in DC don't feel that way anymore.

1:30:41.140 --> 1:30:43.780
 And I think the people of the US don't feel that way anymore

1:30:43.780 --> 1:30:45.100
 because a lot of them are using this stuff.

1:30:45.100 --> 1:30:47.260
 And their general view is,

1:30:47.260 --> 1:30:48.820
 there's a lot of upside potential here.

1:30:48.820 --> 1:30:51.100
 We can all agree, let's get rid of the fraud and the scams.

1:30:51.100 --> 1:30:52.380
 We all wanna get rid of that.

1:30:52.380 --> 1:30:56.900
 So let's create a relatively simple test, which says,

1:30:56.900 --> 1:31:01.900
 if it's like nobody controls more than 20% of it

1:31:02.860 --> 1:31:05.540
 or some threshold, it probably is more like a commodity.

1:31:05.540 --> 1:31:07.540
 If someone's raising money for,

1:31:07.540 --> 1:31:09.980
 they're selling this thing for a business,

1:31:09.980 --> 1:31:11.100
 then it's probably a security.

1:31:11.100 --> 1:31:14.340
 And then if it's more like a medium of exchange,

1:31:14.340 --> 1:31:15.180
 it's a currency.

1:31:15.180 --> 1:31:16.060
 And if it's none of those things,

1:31:16.060 --> 1:31:18.260
 maybe it's artwork or whatever,

1:31:18.260 --> 1:31:21.460
 a legal test like that would help clarify who,

1:31:21.460 --> 1:31:23.540
 which regulator is regulating what.

1:31:23.540 --> 1:31:26.980
 And then we also wanna have probably like a sandbox

1:31:26.980 --> 1:31:29.100
 for innovation where if you're a startup

1:31:29.100 --> 1:31:31.860
 and you're doing less than, I don't know, some number,

1:31:33.260 --> 1:31:34.980
 less than some amount of payment volume

1:31:34.980 --> 1:31:36.380
 or customer funds you're storing,

1:31:36.380 --> 1:31:38.700
 it's like just let those things get off the ground

1:31:38.700 --> 1:31:42.100
 without a soul crushing amount of legal bills

1:31:42.100 --> 1:31:42.940
 and uncertainty.

1:31:42.940 --> 1:31:46.020
 So if the US can get there, that would be great.

1:31:46.020 --> 1:31:47.980
 I think a bunch of other countries now are rushing

1:31:47.980 --> 1:31:50.300
 around the world to sort of create that regulation

1:31:50.300 --> 1:31:52.540
 that does attract innovation.

1:31:52.540 --> 1:31:57.100
 And so in the international bodies like IMF and G20

1:31:57.100 --> 1:32:00.140
 and stuff, they're starting to look at proposed regulation.

1:32:00.140 --> 1:32:02.140
 I hope that Coinbase and a bunch of other crypto companies

1:32:02.140 --> 1:32:03.300
 can help in that conversation too.

1:32:03.300 --> 1:32:04.900
 We have a whole policy effort.

1:32:04.900 --> 1:32:07.100
 I think actually crypto policy efforts

1:32:07.100 --> 1:32:08.380
 are like probably one of the biggest things

1:32:08.380 --> 1:32:09.220
 in DC right now.

1:32:09.220 --> 1:32:13.420
 So it moves slow at the speed of government,

1:32:13.420 --> 1:32:16.660
 but yeah, and in the meantime,

1:32:16.660 --> 1:32:18.500
 we're just trying to help more and more people use crypto

1:32:18.500 --> 1:32:20.940
 because ultimately that's what, in the democracies,

1:32:20.940 --> 1:32:22.100
 that's what they care about.

1:32:22.100 --> 1:32:24.780
 Like they'll do what the people of the country want.

1:32:24.780 --> 1:32:27.060
 So you want governments to start understanding

1:32:27.060 --> 1:32:29.460
 differences between, in the crypto space,

1:32:29.460 --> 1:32:32.460
 commodities, securities, currencies, NFTs.

1:32:32.460 --> 1:32:34.020
 I still don't understand.

1:32:34.020 --> 1:32:37.060
 What are they supposed to make sense of NFTs?

1:32:37.060 --> 1:32:41.100
 What is NFTs exactly from a perspective of a regulator?

1:32:41.100 --> 1:32:42.980
 Yeah, so.

1:32:42.980 --> 1:32:44.820
 Is it the other categories?

1:32:44.820 --> 1:32:47.140
 Yeah, most NFTs you could think of as like artwork,

1:32:47.140 --> 1:32:49.020
 although it's, who knows where it's gonna go.

1:32:49.020 --> 1:32:49.860
 It could be.

1:32:49.860 --> 1:32:50.700
 You mentioned Metaverse, right?

1:32:50.700 --> 1:32:54.860
 You mentioned some kind of unique identity of a thing.

1:32:54.860 --> 1:32:59.860
 Yeah, like there's people selling virtual land in NFTs.

1:32:59.860 --> 1:33:02.740
 I actually, I bought this NFT that's like,

1:33:02.740 --> 1:33:05.940
 it's like citizenship in this like city, Dow in Wyoming.

1:33:05.940 --> 1:33:06.780
 Like I've never been there,

1:33:06.780 --> 1:33:11.540
 but it's almost like a badge or an attestation

1:33:11.540 --> 1:33:13.380
 like to get access to this location.

1:33:14.660 --> 1:33:17.380
 There's like people doing like tickets to events.

1:33:17.380 --> 1:33:19.660
 Like, you know, they're called a POAPs.

1:33:19.660 --> 1:33:23.620
 Like proof of attendance and things like that.

1:33:23.620 --> 1:33:27.820
 So it'll be very interesting to see where NFTs go over time.

1:33:27.820 --> 1:33:29.940
 It could get, and that's the danger.

1:33:29.940 --> 1:33:31.740
 You don't wanna try to like define the regulation

1:33:31.740 --> 1:33:33.380
 if you don't even know where this thing's gonna go, so.

1:33:33.380 --> 1:33:37.540
 And so your efforts in the policy arm is education?

1:33:37.540 --> 1:33:39.900
 Yeah, education, advocacy.

1:33:39.900 --> 1:33:42.100
 We're just trying to be like a helpful educational resource

1:33:42.100 --> 1:33:43.860
 essentially, and then if they give us feedback

1:33:43.860 --> 1:33:46.740
 and they're like, hey, don't do this or don't, or do this,

1:33:46.740 --> 1:33:50.540
 like we're more than happy to do anything that's requested.

1:33:50.540 --> 1:33:52.460
 We generally go get licenses

1:33:52.460 --> 1:33:53.820
 and we've just tried to do the right thing

1:33:53.820 --> 1:33:54.940
 in the absence of clarity,

1:33:54.940 --> 1:33:59.180
 because if it's not clear what the law says,

1:33:59.180 --> 1:34:01.180
 then you should just basically do good things

1:34:01.180 --> 1:34:02.780
 that you think may be required in the future

1:34:02.780 --> 1:34:05.100
 to show good faith effort towards the right thing.

1:34:05.100 --> 1:34:08.700
 And that's part of like innovating in a regulated field,

1:34:08.700 --> 1:34:11.060
 which is, you know, a whole topic in itself.

1:34:11.060 --> 1:34:13.820
 So if you are at the table,

1:34:13.820 --> 1:34:17.300
 let me, this is less the case in the United States,

1:34:17.300 --> 1:34:20.820
 but can government agencies seize a person's cryptocurrency

1:34:20.820 --> 1:34:24.860
 by forcing Coinbase to hand it over?

1:34:24.860 --> 1:34:26.380
 So when you're centralized,

1:34:26.380 --> 1:34:28.220
 they have a phone number to call.

1:34:28.220 --> 1:34:30.500
 Okay, so this is a complicated topic.

1:34:31.980 --> 1:34:34.820
 Like if you really wanna be sure that,

1:34:34.820 --> 1:34:36.700
 this is why people wanna store their own crypto, right?

1:34:36.700 --> 1:34:37.980
 Like with self custodial wallets,

1:34:37.980 --> 1:34:40.420
 like with Coinbase wallet embracing decentralization,

1:34:40.420 --> 1:34:42.180
 they wanna avoid that.

1:34:42.180 --> 1:34:44.820
 Now in the US, there is rule of law, right?

1:34:44.820 --> 1:34:47.260
 So we have reasonable protections in place around

1:34:48.220 --> 1:34:50.500
 like search and seizure and things like that.

1:34:51.660 --> 1:34:52.700
 You know, Coinbase does,

1:34:52.700 --> 1:34:54.460
 we publish transparency reports on this.

1:34:54.460 --> 1:34:56.980
 We get subpoenas, court orders, things like that

1:34:56.980 --> 1:35:00.340
 from various countries around the world.

1:35:00.340 --> 1:35:04.740
 And there are situations where we have been ordered

1:35:04.740 --> 1:35:06.780
 to freeze accounts, things like that.

1:35:08.340 --> 1:35:09.420
 You know, we have to follow the law,

1:35:09.420 --> 1:35:11.020
 is another way to put it.

1:35:11.020 --> 1:35:13.580
 We're a regulated financial service business and so.

1:35:13.580 --> 1:35:16.980
 If the money is used as part of breaking the law,

1:35:16.980 --> 1:35:20.860
 that's what that, in a particular jurisdiction,

1:35:20.860 --> 1:35:22.500
 in a particular.

1:35:22.500 --> 1:35:23.940
 Right, and then the other thing,

1:35:23.940 --> 1:35:25.820
 sometimes we will actually get court orders

1:35:25.820 --> 1:35:27.220
 or subpoenas that are overly broad.

1:35:27.220 --> 1:35:30.940
 We've seen, so they need to follow due process, right?

1:35:30.940 --> 1:35:34.420
 And so we've seen some in the past that were like,

1:35:34.420 --> 1:35:36.580
 well, we need you to freeze this huge number of accounts.

1:35:36.580 --> 1:35:39.180
 And it's like, well, we'll actually have gone to court

1:35:39.180 --> 1:35:40.820
 and like pushed back on some of these and said like,

1:35:40.820 --> 1:35:42.940
 what is your probable cause?

1:35:42.940 --> 1:35:44.460
 And has the threshold been met?

1:35:44.460 --> 1:35:45.940
 And like, we've won some of those cases

1:35:45.940 --> 1:35:46.940
 on behalf of our customers.

1:35:46.940 --> 1:35:50.100
 So yeah, it's actually really,

1:35:50.100 --> 1:35:51.380
 it's kind of unfortunate and frustrating.

1:35:51.380 --> 1:35:54.820
 As a large business, you spend a lot of resources

1:35:54.820 --> 1:35:59.500
 basically interacting with inbound requests

1:35:59.500 --> 1:36:03.700
 by all kinds of lawyers and people and requesting things.

1:36:03.700 --> 1:36:06.020
 And some of them are silly and ridiculous

1:36:06.020 --> 1:36:07.420
 and you have to push back and say no.

1:36:07.420 --> 1:36:11.780
 And so it's kind of a tax on every company at a certain size

1:36:11.780 --> 1:36:14.340
 which ultimately gets passed on to the customer

1:36:14.340 --> 1:36:15.180
 in higher fees.

1:36:15.180 --> 1:36:17.540
 So you have to employ armies of lawyers

1:36:17.540 --> 1:36:18.440
 to deal with this stuff.

1:36:18.440 --> 1:36:19.820
 Can you educate me on something?

1:36:19.820 --> 1:36:23.820
 How much innovation is there in the legal space?

1:36:23.820 --> 1:36:26.340
 So for lawyers working with Coinbase

1:36:26.340 --> 1:36:30.780
 because it's such a new cutting edge thing.

1:36:30.780 --> 1:36:33.580
 So you're, there's a lot of gray area

1:36:33.580 --> 1:36:36.520
 you're supposed to be operating under.

1:36:36.520 --> 1:36:40.100
 Like how hard is it being a lawyer at Coinbase?

1:36:41.100 --> 1:36:43.380
 Like how much precedence is there?

1:36:43.380 --> 1:36:44.500
 I guess is what I'm asking.

1:36:44.500 --> 1:36:46.600
 I mean, just like you said, three years.

1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:49.580
 It's kind of a new space.

1:36:49.580 --> 1:36:51.700
 Yeah, well, it's probably very hard

1:36:51.700 --> 1:36:53.340
 to be a lawyer at Coinbase and very fun

1:36:53.340 --> 1:36:57.200
 because whenever you're in a new field that's growing fast,

1:36:57.200 --> 1:37:02.200
 there isn't a lot of case law and just precedent set.

1:37:02.460 --> 1:37:04.460
 So that's also an opportunity for you

1:37:04.460 --> 1:37:05.420
 to go create that stuff.

1:37:05.420 --> 1:37:07.620
 And that's what a lot of legal careers are made out of

1:37:07.620 --> 1:37:09.700
 is like take a complex situation

1:37:09.700 --> 1:37:11.300
 where you have to balance difficult things.

1:37:11.300 --> 1:37:13.100
 Like how do we prevent bad activity

1:37:13.100 --> 1:37:14.140
 but still enable an innovation?

1:37:14.140 --> 1:37:15.900
 That's a hard question.

1:37:15.900 --> 1:37:18.460
 And there's, you can go draft legislation

1:37:18.460 --> 1:37:19.740
 and circulate it to policymakers

1:37:19.740 --> 1:37:21.820
 or come up with these policies

1:37:21.820 --> 1:37:25.340
 and how do you operate a business in an environment

1:37:25.340 --> 1:37:27.780
 where the law is just unclear, right?

1:37:27.780 --> 1:37:29.980
 It's like try to do the right thing,

1:37:31.220 --> 1:37:33.820
 but like strike the right balance.

1:37:33.820 --> 1:37:36.260
 So yeah, a lot of our lawyers have to come up with that.

1:37:36.260 --> 1:37:37.820
 Very creative stuff.

1:37:37.820 --> 1:37:39.580
 You mentioned one of the things you're focused on

1:37:39.580 --> 1:37:41.060
 is expanding the number of people,

1:37:41.060 --> 1:37:46.060
 maybe a billion people on Coinbase or using cryptocurrency.

1:37:46.340 --> 1:37:47.260
 Where are we at now?

1:37:47.260 --> 1:37:49.020
 How do we get to a billion?

1:37:49.020 --> 1:37:50.720
 As of Q4 last year,

1:37:50.720 --> 1:37:53.660
 we had 89 million verified accounts on Coinbase,

1:37:53.660 --> 1:37:58.660
 but in any given quarter, only maybe like 10

1:37:59.220 --> 1:38:02.100
 or a little more million of those are like really active.

1:38:02.100 --> 1:38:04.940
 So, and then if you look at globally,

1:38:04.940 --> 1:38:06.220
 I think some of the estimates I've seen

1:38:06.220 --> 1:38:08.500
 is maybe there's like 200 million people

1:38:08.500 --> 1:38:11.560
 or something like that who have ever used or tried crypto.

1:38:11.560 --> 1:38:15.620
 So we're a long, you know, we're ways from a billion,

1:38:15.620 --> 1:38:17.600
 but it's not like that far off.

1:38:18.540 --> 1:38:19.940
 How do you get there?

1:38:19.940 --> 1:38:21.380
 How do you get to a billion?

1:38:21.380 --> 1:38:22.420
 So a few things.

1:38:22.420 --> 1:38:23.820
 One is the blockchains have got to become

1:38:23.820 --> 1:38:24.740
 way more scalable.

1:38:26.100 --> 1:38:28.020
 It's kind of like we're all running dial up modems

1:38:28.020 --> 1:38:29.020
 and we need broadband.

1:38:29.020 --> 1:38:32.180
 And so it's just like too expensive, too slow

1:38:32.180 --> 1:38:33.220
 to do all these transactions.

1:38:33.220 --> 1:38:37.980
 And I think if we just get L2s working and scalability,

1:38:37.980 --> 1:38:39.940
 you know, we'll see another order of magnitude

1:38:39.940 --> 1:38:41.600
 kind of come out just from that.

1:38:42.860 --> 1:38:44.900
 I think the second one would be more clear regulation.

1:38:44.900 --> 1:38:46.860
 That would help a lot.

1:38:46.860 --> 1:38:49.540
 I do talk to, you know, pension funds

1:38:49.540 --> 1:38:52.780
 and you know, various asset managers,

1:38:52.780 --> 1:38:53.820
 sovereign wealth funds and stuff.

1:38:53.820 --> 1:38:55.740
 And a lot of them tell me,

1:38:55.740 --> 1:38:58.780
 we've got 1% of our portfolio in crypto today,

1:38:58.780 --> 1:39:02.180
 but we really would rather have like 20% in there.

1:39:02.180 --> 1:39:06.580
 But what we're waiting for is more clear regulation

1:39:06.580 --> 1:39:08.860
 coming out and saying that clear test that I was saying,

1:39:08.860 --> 1:39:11.020
 these assets are commodities regulated by SCPC,

1:39:11.020 --> 1:39:13.720
 these are by SCC, these are by treasury, whatever.

1:39:13.720 --> 1:39:15.500
 So that would be a big unlock.

1:39:15.500 --> 1:39:16.580
 Do transactions.

1:39:16.580 --> 1:39:20.940
 So one of the things that you mentioned, payments, sorry.

1:39:20.940 --> 1:39:21.780
 Yeah.

1:39:21.780 --> 1:39:23.880
 Well, does that unlock a lot of users?

1:39:25.180 --> 1:39:26.100
 Yeah, it does.

1:39:26.100 --> 1:39:28.260
 I mean, remittance is like a huge thing.

1:39:28.260 --> 1:39:30.100
 People sending money home to their families

1:39:30.100 --> 1:39:32.960
 in other countries where the fees are super high.

1:39:32.960 --> 1:39:35.700
 So yeah, if we get blockchains to be more scalable

1:39:35.700 --> 1:39:37.020
 and there's more global adoption,

1:39:37.020 --> 1:39:40.240
 like I think we'll see remittance quarters

1:39:40.240 --> 1:39:42.300
 move over to crypto a lot.

1:39:42.300 --> 1:39:43.620
 There's also just,

1:39:43.620 --> 1:39:45.360
 the other thing that's driving a lot of crypto adoption

1:39:45.360 --> 1:39:49.300
 is basically the creation of more and more third party apps.

1:39:49.300 --> 1:39:52.180
 So, or dApps they're sometimes called decentralized dApps.

1:39:52.180 --> 1:39:55.340
 So a lot of startups now, you know,

1:39:55.340 --> 1:39:57.420
 how like you used to use in the early 2000s,

1:39:57.420 --> 1:39:58.540
 they called them.com startups,

1:39:58.540 --> 1:39:59.980
 but now you don't need to say.com

1:39:59.980 --> 1:40:01.500
 cause everybody's using the internet.

1:40:01.500 --> 1:40:04.380
 And so now there's like hundreds or thousands

1:40:04.380 --> 1:40:06.100
 of these crypto startups,

1:40:06.100 --> 1:40:06.940
 but I think in the future,

1:40:06.940 --> 1:40:08.180
 you won't need to call them crypto startups

1:40:08.180 --> 1:40:09.260
 cause they'll just be called startups

1:40:09.260 --> 1:40:11.900
 cause everyone's using the internet and crypto and whatever.

1:40:11.900 --> 1:40:14.900
 So anyway, the use cases,

1:40:14.900 --> 1:40:17.060
 the utility of crypto is getting better and better

1:40:17.060 --> 1:40:19.060
 with like all these third party apps

1:40:19.060 --> 1:40:20.180
 getting funded and created.

1:40:20.180 --> 1:40:22.660
 And do you think there's going to be a killer

1:40:22.660 --> 1:40:24.940
 or a set of killer dApps,

1:40:24.940 --> 1:40:27.700
 like a thing where nobody can live without?

1:40:27.700 --> 1:40:29.280
 Are we still waiting for that?

1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:30.220
 There's going to be a bunch of them.

1:40:30.220 --> 1:40:31.500
 It's just like, it's like the internet,

1:40:31.500 --> 1:40:33.940
 like what were the killer web companies, you know,

1:40:33.940 --> 1:40:37.020
 like Uber and Wikipedia and Airbnb and Google.

1:40:37.020 --> 1:40:40.420
 And like, so there's going to be some big winners,

1:40:40.420 --> 1:40:42.620
 but there'll be thousands of,

1:40:42.620 --> 1:40:45.020
 this is basically the new,

1:40:45.020 --> 1:40:46.740
 it's like what happened with the.com startups

1:40:46.740 --> 1:40:47.580
 in the early 2000s.

1:40:47.580 --> 1:40:49.140
 It's like a lot of the best entrepreneurs

1:40:49.140 --> 1:40:50.800
 are building crypto startups now.

1:40:50.800 --> 1:40:54.100
 So tons of venture money flowing into the space.

1:40:54.100 --> 1:40:55.620
 A lot of smart young people, so.

1:40:55.620 --> 1:40:57.620
 Do you think Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency

1:40:57.620 --> 1:41:01.700
 will become the reserve currency of the world at some point?

1:41:01.700 --> 1:41:03.740
 Cause this is kind of a controversial idea,

1:41:03.740 --> 1:41:05.460
 but I actually think yes.

1:41:06.520 --> 1:41:08.620
 I do think Bitcoin could end up becoming

1:41:08.620 --> 1:41:10.820
 a reserve currency of the world.

1:41:10.820 --> 1:41:13.140
 So I've been reading Ray Dalio recently

1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:16.660
 with his new book, like The Changing World Order.

1:41:16.660 --> 1:41:19.900
 And I thought it was a really well researched book.

1:41:19.900 --> 1:41:21.780
 He talks in there, he looks back at history, right?

1:41:21.780 --> 1:41:25.340
 He looks at like empires and going back

1:41:25.340 --> 1:41:27.780
 to various Chinese empires, the Dutch and Ottomans

1:41:27.780 --> 1:41:29.880
 and everybody, and how did they rise?

1:41:29.880 --> 1:41:31.700
 And they were able to have the reserve currency

1:41:31.700 --> 1:41:34.300
 as they rose and what produced that?

1:41:34.300 --> 1:41:36.700
 Like it came from good education and innovation

1:41:36.700 --> 1:41:39.260
 and better trade and anyway.

1:41:39.260 --> 1:41:44.260
 So the US by some measures is kind of looks like it's,

1:41:44.860 --> 1:41:46.640
 maybe it's had a really good run

1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:47.940
 and it's coming down a little bit

1:41:47.940 --> 1:41:49.940
 and China is kind of coming up.

1:41:49.940 --> 1:41:51.260
 Who knows how that'll play out, by the way,

1:41:51.260 --> 1:41:52.500
 like the world is very complicated.

1:41:52.500 --> 1:41:54.080
 It could, that could switch.

1:41:55.480 --> 1:41:59.260
 But I guess if the US dollar is gonna be seeing

1:41:59.260 --> 1:42:00.700
 more inflation in the future,

1:42:01.960 --> 1:42:05.900
 the Chinese Yuan is not like necessarily better, right?

1:42:05.900 --> 1:42:08.500
 I mean, they have a ton of debt as well.

1:42:08.500 --> 1:42:13.220
 And it's not like you could really,

1:42:13.220 --> 1:42:15.500
 that the Yuan could be inflated as well, right?

1:42:15.500 --> 1:42:17.020
 It probably will be.

1:42:17.020 --> 1:42:19.960
 And so I do think that there's this group of people today

1:42:19.960 --> 1:42:24.460
 which probably most traditional, I don't know,

1:42:24.460 --> 1:42:27.340
 like the people who run big banks

1:42:27.340 --> 1:42:28.820
 and like governments and stuff that they're not,

1:42:28.820 --> 1:42:29.980
 this is not really on their radar today.

1:42:29.980 --> 1:42:32.720
 But I think there's basically a group of younger people

1:42:32.720 --> 1:42:37.520
 in that kind of 25, 35 year old range who are tech savvy.

1:42:37.520 --> 1:42:39.420
 They're starting to think of crypto as like

1:42:39.420 --> 1:42:42.100
 the primary thing in their financial life.

1:42:42.100 --> 1:42:44.880
 It's like, I basically hold my wealth in crypto

1:42:44.880 --> 1:42:47.900
 and I use dollars or euros or whatever.

1:42:47.900 --> 1:42:49.400
 If I happen to need something,

1:42:49.400 --> 1:42:50.620
 I convert it to that at the last minute.

1:42:50.620 --> 1:42:52.340
 It's like, if I'm traveling,

1:42:52.340 --> 1:42:54.060
 I might convert some local currency in the moment,

1:42:54.060 --> 1:42:57.080
 but that's not where I hold most of my wealth.

1:42:57.080 --> 1:43:01.560
 So this segment of the population is not like massive yet

1:43:01.560 --> 1:43:02.580
 from a GDP point of view,

1:43:02.580 --> 1:43:05.560
 but I think it's a leading indicator

1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:06.680
 of where things could be going.

1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:07.900
 And this is actually good for the world.

1:43:07.900 --> 1:43:10.860
 It's kind of like, especially if China does continue

1:43:10.860 --> 1:43:13.580
 to rise and it has a more authoritarian view,

1:43:13.580 --> 1:43:16.880
 it'll be kind of this very centralized East

1:43:16.880 --> 1:43:21.180
 versus a decentralized West where people are in the West,

1:43:21.180 --> 1:43:24.380
 in the free world, really kind of embracing crypto

1:43:24.380 --> 1:43:27.740
 and a more open, fair, free global financial system,

1:43:27.740 --> 1:43:31.020
 which I think will be enormously beneficial for humanity.

1:43:31.020 --> 1:43:33.900
 And I do think basically Bitcoin is the reserve currency,

1:43:33.900 --> 1:43:36.180
 the gold standard of the crypto economy.

1:43:37.700 --> 1:43:39.260
 So that's pretty crazy.

1:43:39.260 --> 1:43:40.340
 Yeah, the gold standard.

1:43:40.340 --> 1:43:43.620
 I mean, it's also like with Ray Dalio,

1:43:43.620 --> 1:43:47.820
 I feel like China will drive a lot of this,

1:43:47.820 --> 1:43:49.940
 either in response or directly.

1:43:49.940 --> 1:43:52.340
 I mean, I think the ruble,

1:43:52.340 --> 1:43:55.400
 I'm not paying as close attention to the financial systems,

1:43:55.400 --> 1:43:59.980
 but I think they're trying to tie it to gold once again.

1:43:59.980 --> 1:44:01.660
 So that's an interesting,

1:44:01.660 --> 1:44:04.620
 maybe it'll be one of the more authoritarian regime

1:44:04.620 --> 1:44:07.900
 that will switch to Bitcoin standard first.

1:44:07.900 --> 1:44:11.360
 And then it's the West that will,

1:44:11.360 --> 1:44:14.960
 out of that pressure will catch up

1:44:14.960 --> 1:44:17.500
 versus the other way around.

1:44:17.500 --> 1:44:22.500
 It's fascinating to think of what is the forcing function,

1:44:23.120 --> 1:44:26.280
 what kind of perturbation is required to switch,

1:44:26.280 --> 1:44:28.600
 to change anything, honestly, about the financial system.

1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:32.700
 But it could be, as you're saying,

1:44:32.700 --> 1:44:34.960
 just waiting for the people that are young now

1:44:34.960 --> 1:44:36.660
 that are embracing crypto

1:44:36.660 --> 1:44:41.020
 to enter the positions of power, essentially.

1:44:41.020 --> 1:44:42.360
 But I hope that's not the case,

1:44:42.360 --> 1:44:47.360
 because if for any innovation we have to wait,

1:44:47.400 --> 1:44:51.860
 sorry to say, for the older folk to pass away,

1:44:51.860 --> 1:44:54.700
 that's not an efficient way to make change.

1:44:54.700 --> 1:44:57.480
 Yeah, that's a super interesting topic

1:44:57.480 --> 1:45:01.480
 of how people's minds become less plastic as they age.

1:45:02.960 --> 1:45:05.000
 I guess it's a feature.

1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:06.520
 It's called wisdom,

1:45:06.520 --> 1:45:09.120
 but then we also need the wild ones to explore,

1:45:09.120 --> 1:45:11.080
 exploration versus exploitation.

1:45:12.200 --> 1:45:14.480
 You wrote a blog post that's really interesting

1:45:14.480 --> 1:45:16.680
 in September 2020 titled

1:45:16.680 --> 1:45:18.960
 Coinbase is a Mission Focused Company,

1:45:18.960 --> 1:45:20.640
 like what we're talking about.

1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:23.520
 So one interesting thing you said in that blog post

1:45:23.520 --> 1:45:27.540
 is that we're not going to be distracted

1:45:27.540 --> 1:45:31.000
 by activism within the company

1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:35.160
 that's not related to the mission of the company.

1:45:35.160 --> 1:45:38.600
 Now, that's a rare thing for a company to state,

1:45:38.600 --> 1:45:42.320
 for a company CEO to state, especially in this climate.

1:45:44.560 --> 1:45:46.200
 Can you, first of all,

1:45:46.200 --> 1:45:50.320
 describe in a little more detail what you meant?

1:45:50.320 --> 1:45:52.400
 Did you receive blowback for this?

1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:53.620
 I definitely received some blowback,

1:45:53.620 --> 1:45:55.020
 but yeah, I'll describe what I meant.

1:45:55.020 --> 1:45:57.700
 And if you want to talk about how it came to that too,

1:45:57.700 --> 1:45:58.540
 we can talk about that.

1:45:58.540 --> 1:46:03.540
 But what I meant is that there's a lot of companies right now,

1:46:04.040 --> 1:46:06.660
 including tech companies, but not exclusively,

1:46:06.660 --> 1:46:11.440
 where I think like great companies,

1:46:11.440 --> 1:46:12.680
 they have an important mission.

1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:15.080
 They're trying to do something really good for the world.

1:46:15.080 --> 1:46:17.640
 And unfortunately, they're getting a little distracted

1:46:17.640 --> 1:46:20.840
 from that at times because of employee activism

1:46:20.840 --> 1:46:25.320
 that is causing the company to basically jump

1:46:25.320 --> 1:46:26.960
 into whatever the current thing is

1:46:26.960 --> 1:46:30.760
 and try to help is like the positive interpretation.

1:46:30.760 --> 1:46:33.480
 The negative interpretation would be to virtue signal.

1:46:33.480 --> 1:46:38.480
 And my view is that this is actually kind of destructive to,

1:46:38.680 --> 1:46:41.200
 this is largely an American company phenomenon, by the way.

1:46:41.200 --> 1:46:45.640
 I do worry that this is making America less competitive,

1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:46.480
 even though I think of myself

1:46:46.480 --> 1:46:47.820
 as kind of internationally minded,

1:46:47.820 --> 1:46:50.060
 but I am a US citizen, had my whole life here.

1:46:50.060 --> 1:46:54.000
 So when we put out this statement,

1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:56.020
 we had employees that were not in the US

1:46:56.020 --> 1:46:57.200
 who were confused by it.

1:46:57.200 --> 1:46:59.520
 They were like, why did Brian need to say that?

1:46:59.520 --> 1:47:02.480
 It was just saying you're going to focus on work at work.

1:47:02.480 --> 1:47:04.480
 That's what we were doing already.

1:47:04.480 --> 1:47:08.640
 And there was certain pockets of the US, certain cities,

1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:10.320
 in particular where we had employees

1:47:10.320 --> 1:47:15.320
 that a very peculiar cultural phenomenon had evolved

1:47:15.500 --> 1:47:19.080
 where I think people really wanted the company

1:47:19.080 --> 1:47:24.080
 they worked at to be almost acting

1:47:24.120 --> 1:47:25.240
 like the government or something

1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:28.160
 and like trying to solve the hardest societal issues

1:47:28.160 --> 1:47:30.380
 and at least have an opinion on it,

1:47:30.380 --> 1:47:32.100
 if not contribute to the solution

1:47:32.100 --> 1:47:33.320
 on almost everything.

1:47:35.500 --> 1:47:39.800
 And for me, it was a very uncomfortable situation

1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:40.640
 for me as a CEO.

1:47:40.640 --> 1:47:42.000
 I'd never quite been in this situation

1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:45.040
 where most of the time when employees in the past

1:47:45.040 --> 1:47:47.440
 were kind of asking me questions,

1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:49.560
 they would be asking about like,

1:47:49.560 --> 1:47:50.800
 how do we make this product better?

1:47:50.800 --> 1:47:52.320
 Like, what do we do with this competitor?

1:47:52.320 --> 1:47:53.720
 What about this regulator?

1:47:54.720 --> 1:47:56.680
 And it got to a place around that time

1:47:56.680 --> 1:47:59.380
 where most of the questions we were receiving

1:47:59.380 --> 1:48:02.080
 were I think even about things not related to the company

1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:03.260
 they were about broader societal issues.

1:48:03.260 --> 1:48:06.680
 Like Brian, what's your stance on XYZ controversial thing?

1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:10.560
 And it was, I often like didn't have an opinion

1:48:10.560 --> 1:48:12.120
 on these really hard questions, right?

1:48:12.120 --> 1:48:13.640
 And I didn't really,

1:48:13.640 --> 1:48:15.800
 I felt like it was distracting the company.

1:48:15.800 --> 1:48:17.780
 People internally were getting into fights a lot too,

1:48:17.780 --> 1:48:19.640
 like disagreeing with each other.

1:48:19.640 --> 1:48:22.520
 There was a thing where like the social slack internally

1:48:22.520 --> 1:48:24.160
 was turning into a social media almost

1:48:24.160 --> 1:48:26.360
 with people putting in flame wars.

1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:28.000
 So, and this culminated by the way

1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:31.300
 with a walkout that happened in the company.

1:48:31.300 --> 1:48:34.640
 We had received like some demands from employee groups

1:48:34.640 --> 1:48:35.520
 about various things.

1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:37.680
 And there was like basically an antagonistic thing

1:48:37.680 --> 1:48:38.720
 with management and employee.

1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:41.960
 And I was like, we're all on the same team here.

1:48:41.960 --> 1:48:43.240
 If you wanna be antagonistic,

1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:46.480
 let's do it with somebody else outside the company,

1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:48.480
 that we're trying to improve the world in that dimension.

1:48:48.480 --> 1:48:51.080
 So yeah, eventually I was like, okay,

1:48:51.080 --> 1:48:52.780
 the company is not aligned on this.

1:48:53.760 --> 1:48:56.580
 I just don't feel, I don't like the job as CEO, frankly.

1:48:56.580 --> 1:48:58.840
 Like if the job is to come in here every day

1:48:58.840 --> 1:49:02.040
 and like have to squirm in front of like the most difficult

1:49:02.040 --> 1:49:05.400
 societal questions, I don't think I wanna do that job.

1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:06.720
 So like either they're gonna have to go

1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:08.120
 or I'm gonna have to go.

1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:09.400
 And I founded this company

1:49:09.400 --> 1:49:10.340
 and I really believe in the mission.

1:49:10.340 --> 1:49:11.400
 So they're gonna have to go.

1:49:11.400 --> 1:49:14.140
 And what I realized was that,

1:49:14.140 --> 1:49:16.920
 so I basically, I made an exit package available

1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:19.320
 to anybody who wasn't on board with this direction.

1:49:19.320 --> 1:49:21.180
 5% of employees took it.

1:49:21.180 --> 1:49:23.900
 I got the company realigned towards this mission.

1:49:23.900 --> 1:49:25.140
 We're all here to do work.

1:49:25.140 --> 1:49:27.460
 By the way, people can, they can go do anything

1:49:27.460 --> 1:49:29.760
 like political or social activism outside of work.

1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:30.600
 It's totally fine.

1:49:30.600 --> 1:49:33.360
 Like we all, everybody has stuff like that

1:49:33.360 --> 1:49:34.260
 in their personal life.

1:49:34.260 --> 1:49:36.360
 But while at work, we can also disagree at work,

1:49:36.360 --> 1:49:37.600
 by the way, on the work.

1:49:37.600 --> 1:49:39.820
 You know, this is not like a no disagreement culture.

1:49:39.820 --> 1:49:42.320
 Like we should, let's try to get the truth.

1:49:42.320 --> 1:49:44.060
 But don't bring stuff into work

1:49:44.060 --> 1:49:46.280
 that's just gonna create division.

1:49:46.280 --> 1:49:48.440
 Make the workplace a refuge from division

1:49:48.440 --> 1:49:49.460
 about all these crazy things.

1:49:49.460 --> 1:49:51.720
 And like, we're all aligned here to work on the mission.

1:49:51.720 --> 1:49:52.640
 Let's do that.

1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:57.240
 Yeah, that was really, really, really refreshing to hear.

1:49:57.240 --> 1:50:00.340
 So this is me speaking, but there's a sense

1:50:00.340 --> 1:50:03.480
 when companies take on these issues publicly

1:50:03.480 --> 1:50:06.120
 from a CEO position or anywhere else,

1:50:06.120 --> 1:50:10.920
 that it does seem to optimize for virtue signaling

1:50:10.920 --> 1:50:13.480
 versus solving a particular problem.

1:50:13.480 --> 1:50:15.620
 Because to solve a particular problem,

1:50:15.620 --> 1:50:18.800
 you really have to really put in a huge,

1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:20.500
 you have to hire a huge number of,

1:50:20.500 --> 1:50:22.940
 you basically have to create a company with a company

1:50:22.940 --> 1:50:25.400
 to take on a particular thing.

1:50:25.400 --> 1:50:29.440
 But if you allow yourself to internally care

1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:30.620
 about a particular issue,

1:50:30.620 --> 1:50:34.240
 you're basically pacifying some number of employee,

1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:37.000
 like making sure Slack doesn't get out of hand.

1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:40.180
 And then you're doing this kind of, from my perspective,

1:50:40.180 --> 1:50:43.780
 especially on issues that care about fake virtue signaling,

1:50:43.780 --> 1:50:45.560
 basically trying to understand

1:50:45.560 --> 1:50:47.240
 what will make me look the best,

1:50:47.240 --> 1:50:48.720
 what would make the company look the best

1:50:48.720 --> 1:50:50.320
 in this particular aspect.

1:50:50.320 --> 1:50:52.120
 And it just seems very shallow.

1:50:52.120 --> 1:50:54.300
 And it's optimizing for the wrong thing,

1:50:54.300 --> 1:50:56.880
 not for the solving of the problems,

1:50:56.880 --> 1:51:01.880
 but for the making yourself look like the good guy

1:51:01.920 --> 1:51:04.940
 and trying to then leverage that to say,

1:51:04.940 --> 1:51:07.520
 I'm the good guy in all situations.

1:51:07.520 --> 1:51:09.760
 And it just, it's the wrong thing.

1:51:09.760 --> 1:51:13.880
 And perhaps from your perspective as a CEO, as a leader,

1:51:13.880 --> 1:51:16.560
 it's also creating division,

1:51:16.560 --> 1:51:19.300
 unnecessary division within people.

1:51:19.300 --> 1:51:21.280
 Like they get, yeah, there's something about us

1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:25.840
 who gets extremely argumentative about certain topics.

1:51:25.840 --> 1:51:28.440
 They really bring out the emotion.

1:51:28.440 --> 1:51:30.880
 And I think that probably, as you were saying,

1:51:30.880 --> 1:51:33.960
 that emotion is even probably okay,

1:51:33.960 --> 1:51:36.060
 maybe productive when that emotion has to do

1:51:36.060 --> 1:51:37.680
 with the mission of the company.

1:51:37.680 --> 1:51:40.440
 Like you really care about those disagreements

1:51:40.440 --> 1:51:43.920
 versus like something that has nothing to do

1:51:43.920 --> 1:51:51.340
 with increasing economic freedom using crypto.

1:51:51.340 --> 1:51:52.720
 Yeah, it's fascinating.

1:51:52.720 --> 1:51:55.440
 But it was so refreshing because it's rare.

1:51:55.440 --> 1:51:57.320
 Why do you think that's a rare?

1:51:57.320 --> 1:51:59.840
 So the city you're mentioning,

1:51:59.840 --> 1:52:01.960
 I mean, there's a bunch of cities,

1:52:01.960 --> 1:52:06.960
 but San Francisco is one such city when that culture.

1:52:07.420 --> 1:52:12.360
 And it's sad because San Francisco is also,

1:52:12.360 --> 1:52:16.680
 the Bay Area is also the hub historically

1:52:16.680 --> 1:52:20.600
 of some of the greatest innovation in human history.

1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:22.040
 So there's that tension.

1:52:22.040 --> 1:52:24.360
 How did that culture emerge there?

1:52:24.360 --> 1:52:27.320
 Where like the innovation was done by people

1:52:27.320 --> 1:52:29.000
 that are very mission driven.

1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:30.800
 You get a bunch of smart people together

1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:32.640
 to solve a difficult problem.

1:52:32.640 --> 1:52:35.680
 They get maybe sometimes too much blinders on,

1:52:35.680 --> 1:52:37.560
 but they try to balance that.

1:52:37.560 --> 1:52:41.400
 Because it requires that focus to solve an actual problem.

1:52:41.400 --> 1:52:44.680
 And yet that's also the place where this culture emerged.

1:52:44.680 --> 1:52:47.280
 It's a fascinating human dynamic.

1:52:47.280 --> 1:52:48.120
 I don't know.

1:52:48.120 --> 1:52:52.400
 Somebody will one day tell the history of Silicon Valley,

1:52:52.400 --> 1:52:54.240
 not just the innovation,

1:52:54.240 --> 1:52:56.160
 but the social dynamics that occurred there.

1:52:56.160 --> 1:52:58.160
 Anyway, why do you think that's so rare?

1:52:59.600 --> 1:53:01.680
 Well, because people don't wanna get attacked.

1:53:01.680 --> 1:53:04.100
 It's like super, you don't wanna get canceled, right?

1:53:04.100 --> 1:53:07.640
 It's super uncomfortable.

1:53:07.640 --> 1:53:08.960
 Nobody wants to be called a racist

1:53:08.960 --> 1:53:11.920
 or whatever people wanna say on Twitter.

1:53:13.320 --> 1:53:14.520
 Did you get attacked?

1:53:14.520 --> 1:53:16.000
 Yeah, yeah, I definitely got attacked.

1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:17.960
 I mean, and I knew it would be controversial.

1:53:17.960 --> 1:53:19.600
 The only reason I did it, frankly,

1:53:19.600 --> 1:53:22.560
 was that I was kind of at my wit's end.

1:53:22.560 --> 1:53:24.760
 I was like, well, like I said earlier,

1:53:24.760 --> 1:53:26.440
 like the job, the CEO job sucks.

1:53:26.440 --> 1:53:29.440
 Like either I don't wanna do it or they have to go

1:53:29.440 --> 1:53:31.300
 and I'm gonna make the company into something that I want.

1:53:31.300 --> 1:53:36.300
 And I'd spent eight or 90 years of my life at that point

1:53:36.480 --> 1:53:37.320
 kind of building this thing.

1:53:37.320 --> 1:53:39.200
 I was like, well, I could go start another company,

1:53:39.200 --> 1:53:41.240
 but it takes a long time to get momentum with these things.

1:53:41.240 --> 1:53:44.440
 And Coinbase is a very rare thing that happened in the world.

1:53:44.440 --> 1:53:46.240
 I feel very passionate about it.

1:53:46.240 --> 1:53:48.800
 So yeah, I'm not gonna go.

1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:51.040
 Like I need to make this the company that I wanna work at.

1:53:51.040 --> 1:53:53.960
 And what was really interesting was that

1:53:53.960 --> 1:53:56.800
 there was such a huge outpouring of support.

1:53:56.800 --> 1:53:58.240
 So I knew that it would be controversial

1:53:58.240 --> 1:53:59.080
 and I would get attacked.

1:53:59.080 --> 1:54:03.000
 And predictably, there was some journalists

1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:04.520
 and New York Times and all these people

1:54:04.520 --> 1:54:06.840
 who kind of like went and started writing hit pieces

1:54:06.840 --> 1:54:09.440
 on the company shortly thereafter.

1:54:09.440 --> 1:54:12.120
 And they basically just call people who've left the company

1:54:12.120 --> 1:54:14.680
 and can get quotes on whatever they want

1:54:14.680 --> 1:54:16.320
 and then they'll write a story.

1:54:16.320 --> 1:54:18.600
 So mainstream media, I lost a lot of trust

1:54:18.600 --> 1:54:20.000
 in mainstream media, frankly, after that.

1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:22.720
 And of course, it's kind of become obvious since then

1:54:22.720 --> 1:54:25.960
 that most mainstream media is like hyper politicized

1:54:25.960 --> 1:54:26.800
 at this point.

1:54:26.800 --> 1:54:28.560
 It's basically either super left or super right.

1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:33.040
 And it's not really that focused on truth.

1:54:33.040 --> 1:54:35.600
 So that's kind of unfortunate

1:54:35.600 --> 1:54:37.480
 because I think journalism is actually like really important

1:54:37.480 --> 1:54:38.320
 in society.

1:54:38.320 --> 1:54:40.800
 So that whole thing got eroded in the US.

1:54:40.800 --> 1:54:43.400
 Luckily, there's sort of new media, people like you

1:54:43.400 --> 1:54:44.720
 and a whole bunch of people.

1:54:44.720 --> 1:54:47.680
 Did that blog post help that statement,

1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:50.600
 the 95 people that remained,

1:54:50.600 --> 1:54:52.560
 is this still something you struggle with?

1:54:52.560 --> 1:54:56.660
 Because it's also a culture of the broader tech space.

1:54:56.660 --> 1:54:58.880
 Okay, so that was an interesting thing, which was that,

1:54:58.880 --> 1:55:00.720
 so the 95% of people stayed.

1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:05.080
 I got a huge outpouring of support from people who said,

1:55:05.080 --> 1:55:07.280
 thank God you finally spoke up and said something

1:55:07.280 --> 1:55:10.920
 because frankly, it was making it not a very fun place

1:55:10.920 --> 1:55:12.320
 to work either.

1:55:12.320 --> 1:55:16.280
 And I realized that there is, I think there was,

1:55:16.280 --> 1:55:19.040
 I think Nassim Taleb has this blog post

1:55:19.040 --> 1:55:22.400
 about the tyranny of the 1% or something like that.

1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:24.040
 But there's basically a relatively small group,

1:55:24.040 --> 1:55:25.560
 one in 5% or something like that,

1:55:25.560 --> 1:55:28.400
 that is really upset about something.

1:55:28.400 --> 1:55:30.880
 It's not the majority of the company, it's like 5%.

1:55:30.880 --> 1:55:33.540
 There's another 15% or something that are sympathetic

1:55:33.540 --> 1:55:34.440
 to the cause.

1:55:34.440 --> 1:55:35.980
 They're actually somewhat suggestible.

1:55:35.980 --> 1:55:37.560
 They will go along with whatever,

1:55:37.560 --> 1:55:38.720
 because it sounds reasonable.

1:55:38.720 --> 1:55:40.400
 These are like real issues they're talking about.

1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:42.660
 It's not to say that it's not real.

1:55:42.660 --> 1:55:44.940
 And they'll kind of get swept up in it.

1:55:44.940 --> 1:55:48.520
 But there's an 80% of the company that basically

1:55:48.520 --> 1:55:50.400
 doesn't agree or just wants to get their work done

1:55:50.400 --> 1:55:52.920
 without all this drama or distraction.

1:55:52.920 --> 1:55:56.640
 And they're afraid to speak up because if they speak up,

1:55:56.640 --> 1:55:58.800
 they're afraid of being, again, called a racist,

1:55:58.800 --> 1:56:01.960
 like fired, ostracized amongst their peers.

1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:06.640
 And so it did require it to get to a bad enough place

1:56:06.640 --> 1:56:07.800
 for me to finally say, you know what?

1:56:07.800 --> 1:56:10.120
 I just, I feel like I have to do this.

1:56:10.120 --> 1:56:12.600
 Live through the short term attacks of the press,

1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:14.340
 which ultimately was very freeing for me

1:56:14.340 --> 1:56:16.360
 because now I don't really care.

1:56:16.360 --> 1:56:18.120
 And now I can actually just build the company

1:56:18.120 --> 1:56:21.560
 that I want to build without caring about that.

1:56:21.560 --> 1:56:24.200
 And then what was cool was a lot of really great people

1:56:24.200 --> 1:56:25.980
 reached out to the Coinbase too after that.

1:56:25.980 --> 1:56:29.740
 And were like, I'm an early engineer at Google or wherever.

1:56:29.740 --> 1:56:33.040
 And this culture has gotten kind of messed up

1:56:33.040 --> 1:56:34.260
 and I want to work at a company

1:56:34.260 --> 1:56:35.280
 that's willing to stand for that.

1:56:35.280 --> 1:56:37.420
 And so we've gotten a lot of good people come over.

1:56:37.420 --> 1:56:38.960
 Basically what I realized, and by the way,

1:56:38.960 --> 1:56:40.560
 our diversity numbers and all that stuff,

1:56:40.560 --> 1:56:43.160
 people told me when I was drafting this poster,

1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:46.280
 don't post this, people, underrepresented groups

1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:47.880
 will never want to work at this company again.

1:56:47.880 --> 1:56:49.960
 And I was like, I don't think that's true.

1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:53.460
 I talked to our ERG groups and they're not telling me

1:56:53.460 --> 1:56:54.880
 they care about this stuff that much.

1:56:54.880 --> 1:56:57.200
 They're telling me they just want to be respected at work

1:56:57.200 --> 1:56:58.880
 and do good work and contribute.

1:56:58.880 --> 1:57:01.640
 So my gut was telling me that that advice was wrong.

1:57:01.640 --> 1:57:05.040
 And I can tell you a year after doing it,

1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:07.200
 our diversity numbers are basically either the same

1:57:07.200 --> 1:57:08.880
 or better in every category.

1:57:08.880 --> 1:57:10.320
 So that turned out to be false.

1:57:12.340 --> 1:57:17.340
 Look, I hate to be polarizing on either dimension here.

1:57:17.440 --> 1:57:18.560
 I just want to get good work done

1:57:18.560 --> 1:57:20.000
 and build good stuff with technology.

1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:25.000
 So I think companies should just have reasonable policies.

1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:27.320
 You want to get rid of bias in hiring.

1:57:27.320 --> 1:57:29.640
 You want to attract great people from all

1:57:29.640 --> 1:57:31.520
 different backgrounds.

1:57:31.520 --> 1:57:32.840
 We have pledge 1%.

1:57:32.840 --> 1:57:35.080
 We put 1% of the company equity into a foundation.

1:57:35.080 --> 1:57:36.800
 I hope we're able to do good stuff with that.

1:57:36.800 --> 1:57:39.080
 Let's give back in some way.

1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:44.080
 But the main message I guess for me is the core mission,

1:57:46.280 --> 1:57:48.200
 the core work that we're doing on economic freedom

1:57:48.200 --> 1:57:49.940
 and just all of our products,

1:57:49.940 --> 1:57:52.440
 that is the main value that we're contributing in the world.

1:57:52.440 --> 1:57:53.480
 Let's just do that more.

1:57:53.480 --> 1:57:56.520
 And hopefully we can get from 89 million verified users

1:57:56.520 --> 1:57:58.100
 to a billion or whatever.

1:57:58.100 --> 1:58:01.200
 And then I just think that's how we'll have

1:58:01.200 --> 1:58:02.240
 the biggest impact.

1:58:02.240 --> 1:58:03.400
 It's tempting though.

1:58:03.400 --> 1:58:06.380
 It's so interesting how companies get tempted to help.

1:58:07.600 --> 1:58:10.160
 And you step in and it's almost like a drug

1:58:10.160 --> 1:58:11.880
 and then you can't, you forget.

1:58:11.880 --> 1:58:14.740
 I mean, like all of us in life just have to be companies.

1:58:14.740 --> 1:58:18.720
 You get distracted and maintaining focus.

1:58:18.720 --> 1:58:19.760
 You're absolutely right.

1:58:19.760 --> 1:58:22.060
 The way for Coinbase to add value to the world

1:58:22.060 --> 1:58:25.160
 is to maximize the mission that it's on,

1:58:25.160 --> 1:58:27.320
 not other stuff.

1:58:27.320 --> 1:58:29.880
 And when you get wealthier and more successful,

1:58:29.880 --> 1:58:31.920
 it becomes more and more tempting

1:58:31.920 --> 1:58:34.320
 to just help out in some other shallow ways.

1:58:35.160 --> 1:58:36.000
 It's fascinating.

1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:37.520
 And you just kind of brought that to light.

1:58:37.520 --> 1:58:38.700
 So it was very refreshing.

1:58:38.700 --> 1:58:40.240
 And it shouldn't be controversial

1:58:40.240 --> 1:58:43.960
 to sort of focus on just getting stuff done.

1:58:43.960 --> 1:58:44.780
 Well, let me ask you,

1:58:44.780 --> 1:58:46.200
 I mean, do you think that this,

1:58:46.200 --> 1:58:47.620
 it's all these things tie together.

1:58:47.620 --> 1:58:50.540
 There's like a general trend of like more censorship.

1:58:50.540 --> 1:58:52.980
 There's like more cancel culture.

1:58:52.980 --> 1:58:57.320
 There's some of these like freedom values

1:58:57.320 --> 1:59:00.700
 are kind of, even like freezing people's accounts,

1:59:00.700 --> 1:59:02.500
 like the trucker thing that happened.

1:59:02.500 --> 1:59:05.080
 And this seems like there's a general trend

1:59:05.080 --> 1:59:10.080
 of more authoritarian policies there.

1:59:10.820 --> 1:59:13.940
 But do you feel like the tide is turning on that?

1:59:13.940 --> 1:59:17.100
 Like there's counter examples to it we've seen recently.

1:59:17.100 --> 1:59:20.920
 I think it's the last gasp of old way of doing things.

1:59:20.920 --> 1:59:22.940
 And so there's desperation and so on.

1:59:22.940 --> 1:59:27.100
 Because to be fair, it's kind of the internet,

1:59:27.100 --> 1:59:29.660
 which is where's the source of a lot of this,

1:59:29.660 --> 1:59:31.180
 where people have a voice,

1:59:31.180 --> 1:59:34.300
 is making the power centers of the world really nervous.

1:59:34.300 --> 1:59:36.580
 And so that's where that's coming from, I think.

1:59:36.580 --> 1:59:38.780
 And the internet is tricky.

1:59:38.780 --> 1:59:39.980
 It's weird.

1:59:39.980 --> 1:59:41.660
 It's full of bots.

1:59:41.660 --> 1:59:45.820
 It's full of like misinformation of all kinds,

1:59:45.820 --> 1:59:49.860
 full of large groups with conspiracy theories and so on.

1:59:49.860 --> 1:59:51.580
 And I mean misinformation broadly.

1:59:51.580 --> 1:59:53.780
 People are misusing the word misinformation.

1:59:53.780 --> 1:59:56.200
 They're just, governments are just labeling

1:59:56.200 --> 1:59:59.020
 random things with misinformation just to censor them.

1:59:59.900 --> 2:00:03.540
 But I just think it's just like a new world

2:00:03.540 --> 2:00:06.100
 where the internet is really finally taking hold,

2:00:06.100 --> 2:00:07.600
 where there's billions of devices

2:00:07.600 --> 2:00:09.260
 and everybody has a voice.

2:00:09.260 --> 2:00:14.260
 It's almost, basically governments and powerful people

2:00:15.900 --> 2:00:18.420
 are slightly losing hold of power.

2:00:18.420 --> 2:00:20.540
 And they're starting to freak out a little bit.

2:00:20.540 --> 2:00:21.420
 That's it.

2:00:21.420 --> 2:00:25.620
 And once you have young people that are coming up now,

2:00:25.620 --> 2:00:28.660
 gain power, I think we'll rebalance everything.

2:00:28.660 --> 2:00:30.420
 And then there's, like you said,

2:00:30.420 --> 2:00:34.820
 promising signs that it's obvious

2:00:34.820 --> 2:00:38.180
 that the majority of people want freedom.

2:00:38.180 --> 2:00:39.420
 And that means a lot of things.

2:00:39.420 --> 2:00:40.620
 That means economic freedom.

2:00:40.620 --> 2:00:43.000
 That means freedom to have a voice,

2:00:44.380 --> 2:00:45.620
 freedom to move around,

2:00:45.620 --> 2:00:47.940
 freedom to act in the way they,

2:00:47.940 --> 2:00:52.940
 without reasonable sort of limitations

2:00:53.220 --> 2:00:55.020
 by people that don't have their best interests.

2:00:55.020 --> 2:00:59.700
 And I gain more hope from just regular people

2:00:59.700 --> 2:01:04.340
 that are fighting and like demanding

2:01:05.820 --> 2:01:08.620
 being able to have freedom of speech,

2:01:08.620 --> 2:01:11.220
 or more specifically sort of resisting

2:01:12.260 --> 2:01:16.460
 crude overreach of government in the acts of censorship,

2:01:16.460 --> 2:01:18.020
 at least in the United States.

2:01:19.780 --> 2:01:22.640
 And hopefully that percolates out to the rest of the world

2:01:22.640 --> 2:01:25.340
 that's struggling on a much more basic level

2:01:25.340 --> 2:01:27.780
 where people are being put in prison for the words they say,

2:01:27.780 --> 2:01:30.060
 not just banned from Twitter.

2:01:30.060 --> 2:01:31.500
 Right, it could be worse.

2:01:31.500 --> 2:01:36.500
 What are some lessons from your failures and your successes

2:01:37.660 --> 2:01:40.080
 about what it takes to run a company?

2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:43.740
 I think one of the things that I learned about leadership

2:01:43.740 --> 2:01:47.260
 is that I never really thought of myself

2:01:47.260 --> 2:01:48.860
 as a very natural leader, to be honest.

2:01:48.860 --> 2:01:51.580
 I don't think I was a natural leader.

2:01:51.580 --> 2:01:54.060
 But so I always envisioned good leaders

2:01:54.060 --> 2:01:55.500
 as like these military generals,

2:01:55.500 --> 2:01:58.980
 like they seem so confident and they're just like bark orders,

2:01:58.980 --> 2:02:00.360
 charge that hill and do this.

2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:03.260
 And I was actually like more introverted

2:02:03.260 --> 2:02:06.720
 and kind of, I wasn't really confident

2:02:06.720 --> 2:02:07.980
 in the way I communicated.

2:02:09.300 --> 2:02:11.940
 And so what I realized is that

2:02:11.940 --> 2:02:13.140
 there's lots of different kinds of leaders.

2:02:13.140 --> 2:02:15.020
 You can be any kind of CEO you want, right?

2:02:15.020 --> 2:02:18.180
 I was kind of more of like a product, technical focus CEO.

2:02:18.180 --> 2:02:21.720
 And I preferred to sort of hear everyone's opinion.

2:02:21.720 --> 2:02:23.780
 And it wasn't just gonna like render a decision in the room

2:02:23.780 --> 2:02:25.100
 in some like kind of heated moment

2:02:25.100 --> 2:02:26.260
 and like piss off half the people.

2:02:26.260 --> 2:02:28.380
 I would do like, all right, I'm gonna go think about it

2:02:28.380 --> 2:02:30.660
 and I'll send you my decision later today

2:02:30.660 --> 2:02:32.140
 or tomorrow or whatever.

2:02:32.140 --> 2:02:35.040
 And so I found ways to kind of make it work for me

2:02:35.040 --> 2:02:38.600
 where I could basically, I always tried to avoid like,

2:02:40.420 --> 2:02:42.580
 when people getting like super emotional about something

2:02:42.580 --> 2:02:44.540
 and like, I think they're thinking,

2:02:44.540 --> 2:02:46.460
 their judgment goes down, right?

2:02:46.460 --> 2:02:48.460
 And just like never make a decision when you're angry, right?

2:02:48.460 --> 2:02:50.960
 And so I would always sort of try to get a sense of,

2:02:50.960 --> 2:02:52.260
 are these people like trying to be right

2:02:52.260 --> 2:02:54.640
 or are they trying to seek the truth?

2:02:54.640 --> 2:02:57.260
 And you can do these little tricks like,

2:02:57.260 --> 2:02:59.380
 okay, you argue that person's position

2:02:59.380 --> 2:03:00.380
 and you argue the other one

2:03:00.380 --> 2:03:02.840
 and like see if you can genuinely represent it.

2:03:02.840 --> 2:03:05.420
 Now I know you're listening and these kinds of things.

2:03:06.300 --> 2:03:07.140
 But I guess, sorry,

2:03:07.140 --> 2:03:08.540
 getting back to your question about leadership,

2:03:08.540 --> 2:03:12.160
 I think I basically just kept doing things

2:03:12.160 --> 2:03:15.140
 that were a little outside my comfort zone.

2:03:15.140 --> 2:03:17.780
 And then my comfort zone kept getting bigger and bigger.

2:03:17.780 --> 2:03:18.600
 You know?

2:03:18.600 --> 2:03:22.060
 And so I think that's how you build confidence

2:03:22.060 --> 2:03:24.940
 is you do the thing that's scary

2:03:24.940 --> 2:03:26.820
 and it's like a little outside.

2:03:26.820 --> 2:03:29.100
 And like when I first started Coinbase,

2:03:29.100 --> 2:03:30.220
 I had never managed anybody.

2:03:30.220 --> 2:03:32.060
 I would have been scared to death

2:03:32.060 --> 2:03:34.660
 to have put out like a very controversial opinion like that

2:03:34.660 --> 2:03:38.340
 and sort of, all right, 5% of people will go,

2:03:38.340 --> 2:03:39.540
 we didn't know what percent it was gonna be by the way.

2:03:39.540 --> 2:03:41.340
 It could have been 1%, it could have been 50%.

2:03:41.340 --> 2:03:44.100
 Like, but we went into it scary

2:03:44.100 --> 2:03:45.220
 because it was a scary thing.

2:03:45.220 --> 2:03:47.540
 I was like, I don't know, I think this is right.

2:03:47.540 --> 2:03:49.420
 I'm just gonna do it.

2:03:49.420 --> 2:03:50.940
 So if you do enough scary things,

2:03:50.940 --> 2:03:52.820
 like you'll build the confidence.

2:03:52.820 --> 2:03:54.540
 And I feel like I'm still on that journey.

2:03:54.540 --> 2:03:57.060
 Every year or two at Coinbase,

2:03:57.060 --> 2:03:58.700
 there's some big thing that comes out as like,

2:03:58.700 --> 2:04:00.620
 oh my God, like I didn't sleep well for a week

2:04:00.620 --> 2:04:03.580
 and like, this is the next level, right?

2:04:03.580 --> 2:04:05.580
 But that's how you learn and grow.

2:04:05.580 --> 2:04:07.500
 So you're still going up that mountain

2:04:07.500 --> 2:04:09.340
 through the fog one step at a time.

2:04:09.340 --> 2:04:10.580
 Yeah.

2:04:10.580 --> 2:04:13.980
 Can I just quickly ask you about a couple of other efforts

2:04:13.980 --> 2:04:15.860
 that are super interesting that you're involved with?

2:04:15.860 --> 2:04:18.900
 So first of all, a little bit more old school,

2:04:18.900 --> 2:04:20.660
 fascinating effort of research hub.

2:04:22.340 --> 2:04:26.980
 So what's that about the GitHub for open science?

2:04:26.980 --> 2:04:28.740
 Yeah, okay, so basically I've had a chance

2:04:28.740 --> 2:04:30.100
 to try to help a couple other companies

2:04:30.100 --> 2:04:30.940
 get off the ground too,

2:04:30.940 --> 2:04:34.620
 cause I wanna see various efforts out there succeed.

2:04:34.620 --> 2:04:37.180
 And one of them I've always thought about

2:04:37.180 --> 2:04:39.820
 like why is scientific research

2:04:39.820 --> 2:04:41.260
 not more like open source software

2:04:41.260 --> 2:04:42.700
 or why couldn't it be much faster, right?

2:04:42.700 --> 2:04:44.780
 And there's, you've probably have seen this

2:04:44.780 --> 2:04:46.020
 like in an academic setting, right?

2:04:46.020 --> 2:04:48.980
 But there's all kinds of things that feel very antiquated

2:04:48.980 --> 2:04:50.500
 to me about scientific research,

2:04:50.500 --> 2:04:53.700
 everything from the funding process and grants

2:04:53.700 --> 2:04:57.620
 to how peer review works, to how you submit to journals,

2:04:57.620 --> 2:05:00.020
 all the costs associated with journals,

2:05:00.020 --> 2:05:01.220
 you know, that the people,

2:05:01.220 --> 2:05:02.940
 you'd think like you'd get paid for this or something

2:05:02.940 --> 2:05:05.140
 and it would then be available to all the taxpayers for free

2:05:05.140 --> 2:05:06.700
 but no, they're like, they're all pay walled

2:05:06.700 --> 2:05:08.100
 and there's like these big companies

2:05:08.100 --> 2:05:09.820
 that have sort of, in my view,

2:05:09.820 --> 2:05:12.020
 kind of held back innovation here.

2:05:12.020 --> 2:05:14.940
 So, and the preprint servers like bioarchive

2:05:14.940 --> 2:05:16.580
 and archive.org have really helped this

2:05:16.580 --> 2:05:17.700
 but those websites are,

2:05:17.700 --> 2:05:19.820
 they look like they're kind of from like 15 years ago

2:05:19.820 --> 2:05:20.660
 or something.

2:05:20.660 --> 2:05:21.700
 Yeah, it's like Craigslist or something.

2:05:21.700 --> 2:05:24.780
 Yeah, so anyway, one of the things I,

2:05:24.780 --> 2:05:26.300
 once Coinbase went public last year,

2:05:26.300 --> 2:05:27.580
 I had a little bit of liquidity and I was like,

2:05:27.580 --> 2:05:28.900
 all right, let me fund a small team

2:05:28.900 --> 2:05:30.540
 and let's see if we can,

2:05:30.540 --> 2:05:32.700
 if they can like go off and make something better here.

2:05:32.700 --> 2:05:35.140
 So we have a prototype out there,

2:05:35.140 --> 2:05:37.380
 it's at researchhub.com, people can check it out.

2:05:37.380 --> 2:05:39.700
 And it's basically, you know,

2:05:39.700 --> 2:05:41.540
 the first version is kind of like Reddit for science.

2:05:41.540 --> 2:05:44.500
 There's like various hubs, which are like journals,

2:05:44.500 --> 2:05:46.460
 but you know, you can publish papers there,

2:05:46.460 --> 2:05:48.260
 you can use an electronic lab notebook

2:05:48.260 --> 2:05:49.740
 to sort of have a modern day paper,

2:05:49.740 --> 2:05:51.540
 which is not just a PDF that's static,

2:05:51.540 --> 2:05:53.580
 but it's a living document.

2:05:53.580 --> 2:05:54.460
 Ideally in the future, you know,

2:05:54.460 --> 2:05:56.580
 you can get comments and feedback from people in there,

2:05:56.580 --> 2:05:57.980
 you can update it over time.

2:05:57.980 --> 2:06:00.180
 We want people to be able to share the code

2:06:00.180 --> 2:06:02.100
 and the data sets associated with their paper,

2:06:02.100 --> 2:06:05.020
 research paper is not just a PDF.

2:06:05.020 --> 2:06:07.020
 And in the future, we want to make it even where like,

2:06:07.020 --> 2:06:09.860
 you know, people can get funding for science

2:06:09.860 --> 2:06:13.660
 through that site and even license out innovations

2:06:13.660 --> 2:06:14.500
 that they've made.

2:06:14.500 --> 2:06:16.380
 Because the other thing I've noticed in life

2:06:16.380 --> 2:06:17.940
 is that there's kind of like,

2:06:17.940 --> 2:06:19.220
 there's a bunch of people working on science

2:06:19.220 --> 2:06:21.100
 and there's a bunch of people building companies

2:06:21.100 --> 2:06:23.340
 and they very rarely intersect,

2:06:23.340 --> 2:06:25.180
 but when they do, you get the best things

2:06:25.180 --> 2:06:28.020
 like SpaceX and Genentech and even Google

2:06:28.020 --> 2:06:31.020
 and like even Coinbase was based on a research paper,

2:06:31.020 --> 2:06:32.460
 the Bitcoin white paper.

2:06:32.460 --> 2:06:35.300
 And so most business people are like creating companies

2:06:35.300 --> 2:06:36.780
 that don't have any scientific innovation,

2:06:36.780 --> 2:06:40.220
 they're just like marketing based on, you know, whatever.

2:06:40.220 --> 2:06:42.740
 And then a lot of scientists are making things

2:06:42.740 --> 2:06:44.740
 which never actually benefit humanity

2:06:44.740 --> 2:06:47.540
 because they're not commercialized and turned into products.

2:06:47.540 --> 2:06:50.660
 And so if we can somehow create a translation layer

2:06:50.660 --> 2:06:53.300
 between those two groups and help them,

2:06:53.300 --> 2:06:56.260
 you know, helps align the market forces,

2:06:56.260 --> 2:06:58.100
 align scientific research to market forces

2:06:58.100 --> 2:06:59.140
 so that they're more incentivized.

2:06:59.140 --> 2:07:01.740
 Like if you discover CRISPR or something like that,

2:07:01.740 --> 2:07:03.220
 like you should be a billionaire, you know,

2:07:03.220 --> 2:07:05.500
 and like all the downstream implications of that,

2:07:05.500 --> 2:07:07.820
 not going through some antiquated tech transfer office

2:07:07.820 --> 2:07:08.660
 or whatever.

2:07:08.660 --> 2:07:11.140
 And if you're an entrepreneur,

2:07:11.140 --> 2:07:12.540
 you should be looking to commercialize

2:07:12.540 --> 2:07:14.740
 the latest scientific innovations.

2:07:14.740 --> 2:07:17.020
 And so that's kind of like the longterm vision

2:07:17.020 --> 2:07:18.660
 for that site.

2:07:18.660 --> 2:07:20.180
 I think it's just an early step today,

2:07:20.180 --> 2:07:22.540
 but we've got like a really passionate community on there

2:07:22.540 --> 2:07:24.780
 that are jumping into like, you know,

2:07:24.780 --> 2:07:29.700
 computer science or longevity or various bio hubs

2:07:29.700 --> 2:07:31.780
 or whatever and like beginning to source

2:07:31.780 --> 2:07:34.620
 the best innovations, but also discuss them, improve them

2:07:34.620 --> 2:07:36.220
 and publish through the site.

2:07:36.220 --> 2:07:38.220
 So I have a question about incentives,

2:07:38.220 --> 2:07:39.980
 but first let me say for people listening

2:07:39.980 --> 2:07:42.660
 who are outside of academia might not be familiar

2:07:42.660 --> 2:07:44.260
 with an absurd situation.

2:07:44.260 --> 2:07:47.220
 So there's journals, like you mentioned,

2:07:47.220 --> 2:07:51.620
 and scientists publishing those journals

2:07:51.620 --> 2:07:56.300
 and the journals provide very little value

2:07:56.300 --> 2:08:00.620
 except matching you with reviewers that are unpaid.

2:08:00.620 --> 2:08:05.540
 And so in the digital world,

2:08:05.540 --> 2:08:07.460
 they're providing basically almost no value

2:08:07.460 --> 2:08:09.060
 except hosting your paper.

2:08:10.300 --> 2:08:15.300
 And they put up a paywall and charge people to access that.

2:08:15.580 --> 2:08:18.500
 And that charge is not like even Netflix fees,

2:08:18.500 --> 2:08:20.860
 you're talking about a lot of money.

2:08:20.860 --> 2:08:24.060
 So they're basically blocking your research

2:08:24.060 --> 2:08:27.060
 that should be wide open from the world

2:08:27.060 --> 2:08:28.220
 and creating a paywall.

2:08:28.220 --> 2:08:32.860
 It's a fascinating like scam that's actually holding back.

2:08:32.860 --> 2:08:34.620
 I don't, it's a shitty scam

2:08:34.620 --> 2:08:37.300
 because you're not making that much money.

2:08:37.300 --> 2:08:38.780
 I feel like a definition of a scam,

2:08:38.780 --> 2:08:40.780
 you should at least be making money.

2:08:40.780 --> 2:08:42.140
 So like significant amount of money,

2:08:42.140 --> 2:08:44.380
 you're basically making shady money

2:08:44.380 --> 2:08:46.860
 and holding back all of human knowledge, okay.

2:08:46.860 --> 2:08:49.220
 So that put aside and people get a little confused

2:08:49.220 --> 2:08:53.420
 because the journals aren't the ones paying the scientists.

2:08:53.420 --> 2:08:55.820
 People think like the journals are somehow

2:08:55.820 --> 2:08:59.980
 funding the scientists, therefore they have the right

2:08:59.980 --> 2:09:01.140
 to put up a paywall.

2:09:01.140 --> 2:09:03.500
 No, no, no, the funding is coming from elsewhere.

2:09:03.500 --> 2:09:07.060
 Journals are the middleman that nobody asks for,

2:09:07.060 --> 2:09:08.220
 especially in the digital world.

2:09:08.220 --> 2:09:13.220
 Anyway, that said, there is a interesting kind of incentives

2:09:13.500 --> 2:09:16.100
 for scientists, which is prestige and so on.

2:09:16.100 --> 2:09:20.060
 So there's a thing with journals,

2:09:20.060 --> 2:09:22.300
 if there's a prestigious journal

2:09:22.300 --> 2:09:26.660
 and you pass the review process, you get into that journal

2:09:26.660 --> 2:09:29.780
 or a prestigious conference in computer science,

2:09:29.780 --> 2:09:33.420
 then that's seen as a good thing in your resume.

2:09:33.420 --> 2:09:36.100
 And, oh, not just your resume, within your community,

2:09:36.100 --> 2:09:37.380
 that's a respected thing.

2:09:37.380 --> 2:09:40.700
 Is there some way to achieve that same kind of incentive

2:09:40.700 --> 2:09:44.740
 in the open setting of research hub?

2:09:44.740 --> 2:09:49.480
 So like where I could say, I got X, Y and Z,

2:09:49.480 --> 2:09:50.820
 like, look, I'm impressive

2:09:50.820 --> 2:09:52.680
 because this happened on research hub.

2:09:52.680 --> 2:09:53.520
 I think you're right.

2:09:53.520 --> 2:09:56.920
 Like the whole academia, like progress track

2:09:56.920 --> 2:09:58.900
 is about like where you got published

2:09:58.900 --> 2:09:59.840
 and how many citations.

2:09:59.840 --> 2:10:04.240
 And it's kind of like a false economy of reputation

2:10:04.240 --> 2:10:06.900
 because like, there's not real money backing it.

2:10:06.900 --> 2:10:10.220
 And so I think we've thought about this a little bit.

2:10:10.220 --> 2:10:12.180
 And I think the research hub team has an opportunity

2:10:12.180 --> 2:10:14.860
 to do something here that basically says like,

2:10:14.860 --> 2:10:18.060
 okay, I had the top paper for 2022

2:10:18.060 --> 2:10:21.580
 in biology on in here.

2:10:21.580 --> 2:10:23.220
 And you basically publish a list,

2:10:23.220 --> 2:10:26.180
 a leaderboards of these like top for the month,

2:10:26.180 --> 2:10:29.180
 the year in all these different categories.

2:10:29.180 --> 2:10:31.820
 Then actually, we should probably give out grants

2:10:31.820 --> 2:10:34.500
 and awards in addition to that,

2:10:34.500 --> 2:10:36.340
 fund those people almost like fellows

2:10:36.340 --> 2:10:40.100
 or even give out like, you know how like the Nobel prize,

2:10:40.100 --> 2:10:42.080
 there should be like a research hub prize or something

2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:43.940
 and like ship people,

2:10:43.940 --> 2:10:47.740
 maybe even ship like a print version of a journal

2:10:47.740 --> 2:10:50.260
 that is the top papers in each category

2:10:50.260 --> 2:10:51.260
 in each month or whatever.

2:10:51.260 --> 2:10:53.060
 And then like people want to put that in their wall

2:10:53.060 --> 2:10:53.900
 and in the lab.

2:10:53.900 --> 2:10:57.580
 And like, so I do think we need to sort of change,

2:10:57.580 --> 2:10:59.980
 I don't know, like the traditional folks in academia

2:10:59.980 --> 2:11:02.540
 or science would probably think this is like crazy idea.

2:11:02.540 --> 2:11:04.580
 But I think we need to change the culture

2:11:04.580 --> 2:11:09.360
 to not celebrate getting published in paywall journals,

2:11:09.360 --> 2:11:11.420
 almost like friends don't let friends publish

2:11:11.420 --> 2:11:14.140
 in like paywall journals.

2:11:14.140 --> 2:11:16.500
 Like, cause that's, it's just not helping humanity.

2:11:16.500 --> 2:11:19.060
 So like, you know, it should be more prestigious

2:11:19.060 --> 2:11:23.940
 to publish in an open science way and get the top spot.

2:11:23.940 --> 2:11:25.740
 That should be celebrated above being published

2:11:25.740 --> 2:11:27.540
 in whatever, I don't even want to name one of them,

2:11:27.540 --> 2:11:28.380
 you know?

2:11:28.380 --> 2:11:30.100
 Well, there's currently,

2:11:30.100 --> 2:11:31.300
 the culture has already shifted

2:11:31.300 --> 2:11:33.660
 to where almost everybody publishes on archive

2:11:33.660 --> 2:11:34.900
 and by archive and so on.

2:11:34.900 --> 2:11:36.100
 Yeah.

2:11:36.100 --> 2:11:39.740
 But, so that the culture is there on that scene,

2:11:39.740 --> 2:11:42.400
 friends don't let friends not publish open,

2:11:42.400 --> 2:11:44.700
 but then the prestige thing is missing,

2:11:44.700 --> 2:11:48.020
 which is like anyone can publish an archive.

2:11:48.020 --> 2:11:50.040
 So how do you know it's actually a strong paper?

2:11:50.040 --> 2:11:55.000
 Now, funny enough, even with the crappy systems we have now,

2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:56.580
 word of mouth is powerful.

2:11:56.580 --> 2:12:00.280
 Like you have a, like citation system is pretty powerful.

2:12:00.280 --> 2:12:02.700
 So like you say, okay, this is a strong paper.

2:12:02.700 --> 2:12:06.180
 We don't need reviewers, our human eyes are the reviewers,

2:12:06.180 --> 2:12:08.540
 like the community is the reviewers.

2:12:08.540 --> 2:12:11.060
 So it's already, like that part is there,

2:12:11.060 --> 2:12:15.980
 but it would be nice to have like, you know,

2:12:15.980 --> 2:12:18.460
 nature level, like this is respect,

2:12:18.460 --> 2:12:21.060
 this is a respectful accomplishment.

2:12:21.060 --> 2:12:21.900
 Yeah.

2:12:21.900 --> 2:12:23.780
 And something like a leaderboard,

2:12:23.780 --> 2:12:25.980
 but a stable kind of system.

2:12:25.980 --> 2:12:26.820
 Yeah.

2:12:26.820 --> 2:12:27.660
 And I should mention too,

2:12:27.660 --> 2:12:29.100
 so there's a crypto angle to this too,

2:12:29.100 --> 2:12:31.540
 which is, so research hub has a coin associated

2:12:31.540 --> 2:12:32.580
 with research coin.

2:12:32.580 --> 2:12:34.400
 And it's basically, if people, you know,

2:12:34.400 --> 2:12:37.100
 upvote your paper or like support it,

2:12:37.100 --> 2:12:38.980
 you'll accumulate more research coin,

2:12:38.980 --> 2:12:42.180
 which is basically like rep or like a reward token.

2:12:42.180 --> 2:12:45.340
 And so that is a way to, I guess,

2:12:45.340 --> 2:12:49.500
 measure the community's collective view of that paper,

2:12:49.500 --> 2:12:51.180
 a form of peer review.

2:12:51.180 --> 2:12:53.140
 And it can even be weighted by like the reputation

2:12:53.140 --> 2:12:55.980
 of the people voting on it and that sort of thing over time.

2:12:57.100 --> 2:12:59.500
 Yeah, I think the last thing I'll just say is that,

2:12:59.500 --> 2:13:02.460
 so I think from a rep, like a prestige point of view,

2:13:03.660 --> 2:13:05.100
 it won't start off that way.

2:13:05.100 --> 2:13:07.440
 It'll probably start off like being a little more quirky,

2:13:07.440 --> 2:13:10.100
 like, you know, like remember when YouTube first started,

2:13:10.100 --> 2:13:13.260
 it was like people posting weird cat videos and stuff.

2:13:13.260 --> 2:13:14.400
 And, but now like, you know,

2:13:14.400 --> 2:13:16.020
 if you have a million subscribers on YouTube,

2:13:16.020 --> 2:13:18.460
 that's probably better than getting like a TV show on NBC

2:13:18.460 --> 2:13:21.000
 or whoever the traditional gatekeeper was.

2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:23.460
 So my hope, it might take 10 years, 20 years, whatever,

2:13:23.460 --> 2:13:27.140
 but I'm hoping that this can sort of be the new

2:13:27.140 --> 2:13:30.060
 prestigious way that young people publish in science

2:13:30.060 --> 2:13:32.460
 and it'll come to be viewed as more prestigious.

2:13:32.460 --> 2:13:34.100
 The journals, the traditional journals

2:13:34.100 --> 2:13:36.020
 will be viewed as old fashioned.

2:13:36.020 --> 2:13:41.020
 Well, it's definitely a system that could do a lot better.

2:13:41.440 --> 2:13:43.380
 And there's a lot of incredible, brilliant people

2:13:43.380 --> 2:13:47.500
 doing science, they deserve better, the better platforms.

2:13:47.500 --> 2:13:50.260
 So another thing you're taking on and helping out with

2:13:50.260 --> 2:13:53.820
 is this new limit, which is looking at longevity.

2:13:53.820 --> 2:13:55.660
 What's the idea there?

2:13:55.660 --> 2:13:58.080
 Yeah, okay, so as you can see, I'm excited about science.

2:13:58.080 --> 2:14:01.140
 Like I think, you know, science is sort of the,

2:14:01.140 --> 2:14:03.300
 basically if you get scientific innovation,

2:14:03.300 --> 2:14:06.340
 then you get better products and you get better

2:14:06.340 --> 2:14:09.700
 economic growth and then you get all kinds of like surplus

2:14:09.700 --> 2:14:12.500
 in society that can go to arts and philosophy

2:14:12.500 --> 2:14:13.340
 and like all kinds of stuff.

2:14:13.340 --> 2:14:17.660
 But with new limits, so yeah, I kind of got,

2:14:17.660 --> 2:14:21.080
 I started hosting some dinners with scientists last year

2:14:21.080 --> 2:14:23.620
 and I was learning about all kinds of the latest stuff

2:14:23.620 --> 2:14:26.340
 happening in bio and there's a lot of really cool stuff

2:14:26.340 --> 2:14:28.340
 happening with like CAR T cells and CRISPR

2:14:28.340 --> 2:14:29.180
 and all these things.

2:14:29.180 --> 2:14:32.740
 And anyway, one of the topics I started to learn more about

2:14:32.740 --> 2:14:35.140
 was something called cell reprogramming.

2:14:35.140 --> 2:14:38.700
 And, you know, people maybe have heard of this

2:14:38.700 --> 2:14:40.700
 induced pluripotent stem cells where you could take

2:14:40.700 --> 2:14:43.260
 like a skin cell and turn it back into a stem cell.

2:14:43.260 --> 2:14:46.900
 And Shinya Yamanaka won the Nobel prize for this work

2:14:46.900 --> 2:14:49.020
 that was done in 2006.

2:14:49.020 --> 2:14:51.780
 And, you know, it's kind of a crazy thing.

2:14:51.780 --> 2:14:54.300
 You can turn one cell into another type of cell.

2:14:54.300 --> 2:14:58.020
 Well, people recently have been experimenting

2:14:58.020 --> 2:15:01.280
 with different types of transcription factors

2:15:01.280 --> 2:15:02.900
 that would either not,

2:15:02.900 --> 2:15:04.140
 you don't want the cell to go all the way back

2:15:04.140 --> 2:15:05.600
 to being a stem cell.

2:15:05.600 --> 2:15:07.320
 You can end up getting like cancerous cells

2:15:07.320 --> 2:15:08.160
 and things like that.

2:15:08.160 --> 2:15:10.520
 But you want it basically the cell to revert

2:15:10.520 --> 2:15:13.380
 a little bit earlier in its, you know,

2:15:13.380 --> 2:15:15.020
 it would call it the Waddington landscape,

2:15:15.020 --> 2:15:17.660
 but it's basically like go, become act,

2:15:17.660 --> 2:15:19.700
 start to act like a bit of a younger cell,

2:15:19.700 --> 2:15:23.020
 but not to de differentiate and become more like a stem cell.

2:15:23.020 --> 2:15:25.760
 And so I decided this might be an interesting area

2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:27.020
 to go fund.

2:15:27.020 --> 2:15:28.780
 I think that that team has come together.

2:15:28.780 --> 2:15:30.900
 There's like some really talented people

2:15:30.900 --> 2:15:32.540
 who've come together to help get that off the ground.

2:15:32.540 --> 2:15:36.080
 And they're basically building a platform

2:15:36.080 --> 2:15:38.820
 that can test a lot of different transcription factors

2:15:38.820 --> 2:15:41.420
 on different cell types and hopefully find ways

2:15:41.420 --> 2:15:44.380
 to rejuvenate different types of cells and tissues

2:15:44.380 --> 2:15:45.520
 to extend human health span.

2:15:45.520 --> 2:15:47.760
 I mean, the moonshot goal here, you know,

2:15:47.760 --> 2:15:51.700
 the get to Mars is that there could be some therapy here

2:15:51.700 --> 2:15:54.260
 that in, I don't know, 10 or 20 years that you take

2:15:54.260 --> 2:15:56.580
 and from a whole body point of view

2:15:56.580 --> 2:15:58.340
 is sort of rejuvenating tissue,

2:15:58.340 --> 2:16:00.740
 not just one type of tissue like your immune system,

2:16:00.740 --> 2:16:02.560
 but eventually your whole body, maybe even your brain

2:16:02.560 --> 2:16:04.900
 so that, you know, we don't have that issue

2:16:04.900 --> 2:16:06.540
 where people who are older have trouble learning

2:16:06.540 --> 2:16:08.740
 or they're more ossified in their thinking.

2:16:10.100 --> 2:16:13.700
 To me, this is just, I always think about, you know,

2:16:13.700 --> 2:16:15.540
 it's actually a little inspired by Elon, right?

2:16:15.540 --> 2:16:18.060
 Is like, what are some of the biggest things in the world

2:16:18.060 --> 2:16:20.520
 like that are probably high technology risk,

2:16:20.520 --> 2:16:21.540
 but if they did work,

2:16:21.540 --> 2:16:23.560
 maybe they're kind of low chance of working,

2:16:23.560 --> 2:16:26.040
 but if they did work would have enormous impact.

2:16:26.040 --> 2:16:28.380
 I like the idea of trying hard tech problems,

2:16:28.380 --> 2:16:30.880
 especially for people like founders like me

2:16:30.880 --> 2:16:32.460
 who've made some money in software,

2:16:32.460 --> 2:16:34.700
 which I think we're in kind of like a golden age of software

2:16:34.700 --> 2:16:36.540
 so there's like fortunes to be made,

2:16:36.540 --> 2:16:38.680
 but if you do make some money in that,

2:16:38.680 --> 2:16:42.700
 my hope is people will like do atoms, not bits, you know,

2:16:42.700 --> 2:16:45.020
 and try some of the harder things like in biotech

2:16:45.020 --> 2:16:48.460
 or, you know, I guess he's doing cars and rockets and stuff,

2:16:48.460 --> 2:16:52.500
 but anyway, I think we should try hard tech

2:16:52.500 --> 2:16:54.640
 or, you know, physical science problems as well

2:16:54.640 --> 2:16:58.140
 and see if that can advance for team human.

2:16:58.140 --> 2:17:02.740
 Yeah, so he's also doing bio with Neuralink

2:17:02.740 --> 2:17:07.340
 and I feel like bio is tough because it's messy.

2:17:07.340 --> 2:17:08.380
 We don't understand it as well.

2:17:08.380 --> 2:17:09.460
 We don't understand it.

2:17:09.460 --> 2:17:14.240
 The risk is higher in terms of, not the risk is higher,

2:17:14.240 --> 2:17:18.260
 but like you have to deal with the actual sort of,

2:17:18.260 --> 2:17:21.500
 to get to human, to get to stuff

2:17:21.500 --> 2:17:24.680
 where it could be therapies for actual human bodies

2:17:24.680 --> 2:17:29.620
 is tricky because you have to prove that it's safe,

2:17:29.620 --> 2:17:33.560
 it's effective, all those kinds of things with FDA.

2:17:33.560 --> 2:17:34.880
 I mean, it's just, it's tricky.

2:17:34.880 --> 2:17:36.160
 It's very difficult.

2:17:36.160 --> 2:17:38.520
 It's a long journey.

2:17:38.520 --> 2:17:39.360
 I mean.

2:17:39.360 --> 2:17:41.700
 If I can give a quick plug.

2:17:41.700 --> 2:17:43.420
 So yeah, I'm on the board at New Limit.

2:17:43.420 --> 2:17:45.160
 We're hiring talented scientists

2:17:45.160 --> 2:17:47.040
 that are interested in the cellular programming space.

2:17:47.040 --> 2:17:48.840
 They don't necessarily have to be coming

2:17:48.840 --> 2:17:50.720
 from like an aging background or anything like that.

2:17:50.720 --> 2:17:53.120
 There's sort of a small group of people doing even.

2:17:53.120 --> 2:17:54.240
 So this is a new thing?

2:17:54.240 --> 2:17:56.400
 This is a, is New Limit relatively new?

2:17:56.400 --> 2:17:57.640
 Yeah, it's very new.

2:17:57.640 --> 2:18:00.700
 There's a small team today, just a handful of people.

2:18:00.700 --> 2:18:03.660
 And so we're hiring more there.

2:18:03.660 --> 2:18:05.600
 If people are excited about that space, reach out.

2:18:05.600 --> 2:18:07.920
 And same thing for Research Hub.

2:18:07.920 --> 2:18:10.100
 There's a small team there that's really awesome.

2:18:10.100 --> 2:18:12.400
 That's doing more like software engineering,

2:18:12.400 --> 2:18:15.040
 design, product, that kind of stuff.

2:18:15.040 --> 2:18:16.760
 What advice would you give?

2:18:16.760 --> 2:18:21.240
 If you put on your old, wise, sage hat,

2:18:21.240 --> 2:18:24.000
 what advice would you give to young people today?

2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:29.000
 High school, maybe undergrad and college about life.

2:18:29.560 --> 2:18:34.200
 So like career, having a career they can be proud of,

2:18:34.200 --> 2:18:36.380
 or maybe a life they can be proud of.

2:18:37.720 --> 2:18:40.440
 So people can do whatever they want to be happy, right?

2:18:40.440 --> 2:18:42.360
 So there's not one way to do it.

2:18:42.360 --> 2:18:44.840
 I do think that some people,

2:18:44.840 --> 2:18:46.440
 a particular type of people out there,

2:18:46.440 --> 2:18:47.280
 a lot of people actually,

2:18:47.280 --> 2:18:48.480
 they want to have an impact on the world.

2:18:48.480 --> 2:18:50.960
 That's how they get a sense of fulfillment, right?

2:18:50.960 --> 2:18:53.680
 So I mean, you need to have like health, physical health.

2:18:53.680 --> 2:18:55.040
 You need to have good relationships,

2:18:55.040 --> 2:18:56.440
 like there's lots of things.

2:18:56.440 --> 2:18:58.440
 But most people want to do something important.

2:18:58.440 --> 2:18:59.720
 They want to have fulfilling work,

2:18:59.720 --> 2:19:01.760
 a way that they can feel like they're contributing.

2:19:02.800 --> 2:19:05.240
 I think a lot of people, young people today are thinking

2:19:05.240 --> 2:19:09.560
 like I should be an activist or something like that.

2:19:09.560 --> 2:19:11.480
 And there's people in the world who have power

2:19:11.480 --> 2:19:13.840
 and a lot of people who don't, I don't have power.

2:19:13.840 --> 2:19:18.120
 And so the way to change the world is to speak truth

2:19:18.120 --> 2:19:20.440
 to power or like criticize power

2:19:20.440 --> 2:19:24.200
 and try to pressure them to change.

2:19:25.400 --> 2:19:27.040
 To me, I don't think that's the right way

2:19:27.040 --> 2:19:28.880
 to actually have an impact on the world

2:19:28.880 --> 2:19:33.720
 because everybody has probably,

2:19:33.720 --> 2:19:36.840
 I think people have more power than they realize.

2:19:36.840 --> 2:19:39.520
 And by the way, it's easy to be a critic.

2:19:39.520 --> 2:19:42.200
 It's hard to actually change these things and fix it.

2:19:42.200 --> 2:19:44.680
 And so you'll get a lot of accolades

2:19:44.680 --> 2:19:46.080
 from friends and things like that

2:19:46.080 --> 2:19:48.600
 if you kind of go around criticizing, it's easy to do.

2:19:48.600 --> 2:19:51.520
 Like everything is broken and could be better,

2:19:51.520 --> 2:19:53.360
 including stuff I'm working on.

2:19:53.360 --> 2:19:56.040
 I find like so frustrating.

2:19:56.040 --> 2:19:57.640
 There's a million things I want to be better about

2:19:57.640 --> 2:19:59.280
 like what we're doing in Coinbase.

2:20:01.200 --> 2:20:04.120
 So be the person in the arena,

2:20:04.120 --> 2:20:05.520
 like that Theodore Roosevelt quote,

2:20:05.520 --> 2:20:06.960
 I think he said it right.

2:20:06.960 --> 2:20:10.160
 Like go chew glass and stare into the abyss.

2:20:10.160 --> 2:20:11.840
 Like if you really want to have an impact,

2:20:11.840 --> 2:20:14.560
 either join a company that has a mission

2:20:14.560 --> 2:20:16.200
 that is trying to fix the thing you're passionate about

2:20:16.200 --> 2:20:18.960
 or start that company if it doesn't exist

2:20:18.960 --> 2:20:21.640
 or start a charity if it's not suitable

2:20:21.640 --> 2:20:23.080
 to be a company or whatever it is,

2:20:23.080 --> 2:20:25.680
 but go try to be a part of the solution.

2:20:25.680 --> 2:20:30.320
 Don't just criticize or be a part of the problem.

2:20:30.320 --> 2:20:34.160
 My hope is that more people can realize

2:20:37.520 --> 2:20:39.880
 that they actually can have a meaningful impact that way.

2:20:39.880 --> 2:20:41.720
 And I think that to me,

2:20:41.720 --> 2:20:44.360
 technology is actually one of the most important ways

2:20:44.360 --> 2:20:45.480
 to improve the world.

2:20:45.480 --> 2:20:49.200
 Like if you look at climate change,

2:20:49.200 --> 2:20:51.960
 like a lot of the best ideas like carbon sequestration,

2:20:51.960 --> 2:20:53.640
 all these things, it's a technology thing, right?

2:20:53.640 --> 2:20:55.960
 If you want to try to fix education,

2:20:55.960 --> 2:20:57.400
 it's like look at like Khan Academy

2:20:57.400 --> 2:20:59.080
 and all this stuff going online, right?

2:20:59.080 --> 2:21:02.760
 If you want to fix, you know, whatever transportation

2:21:02.760 --> 2:21:06.280
 and like the financial system and global freedom

2:21:06.280 --> 2:21:07.840
 and like equality of all these things,

2:21:07.840 --> 2:21:11.240
 like there's typically the way to get something changed

2:21:11.240 --> 2:21:13.280
 in the world today is with technology.

2:21:13.280 --> 2:21:15.880
 And so I do think people, it's very bizarre to me

2:21:15.880 --> 2:21:19.200
 that there's this kind of like anti tech thing going on.

2:21:19.200 --> 2:21:20.520
 Look, nothing is perfect.

2:21:20.520 --> 2:21:21.640
 Like if you create something new

2:21:21.640 --> 2:21:23.520
 and like tens of millions of people use it

2:21:23.520 --> 2:21:24.400
 or billions of people use it,

2:21:24.400 --> 2:21:26.440
 it's like there's going to be some bad people

2:21:26.440 --> 2:21:27.360
 who use it too, okay?

2:21:27.360 --> 2:21:29.520
 And there's, you know, society is complicated,

2:21:29.520 --> 2:21:33.040
 but like I think most of these things have been net positive

2:21:33.040 --> 2:21:34.640
 because most people in the world are good

2:21:34.640 --> 2:21:36.200
 is at least my view.

2:21:36.200 --> 2:21:39.120
 So yes, we can mitigate like the 1% of bad people

2:21:39.120 --> 2:21:41.000
 trying to abuse something,

2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:42.640
 but 99% of people in the world are good.

2:21:42.640 --> 2:21:45.040
 And the way you can improve the world is with technology,

2:21:45.040 --> 2:21:46.480
 joining companies, starting companies

2:21:46.480 --> 2:21:48.260
 that are working on the right stuff.

2:21:48.260 --> 2:21:50.920
 So I hope more young people do that.

2:21:50.920 --> 2:21:53.560
 And just, if you're not sure what to do,

2:21:53.560 --> 2:21:54.880
 like just get started with anything.

2:21:54.880 --> 2:21:55.780
 That's how you learn.

2:21:55.780 --> 2:21:57.800
 And basically have the optimism

2:21:57.800 --> 2:22:00.240
 that you have the power to do the change.

2:22:00.240 --> 2:22:05.140
 So it's easy to distract yourself by being the critic.

2:22:06.240 --> 2:22:08.200
 That's almost like acknowledging to yourself

2:22:08.200 --> 2:22:09.600
 that that's all you can be,

2:22:09.600 --> 2:22:14.600
 but basically everybody has the power to be the fixer.

2:22:16.160 --> 2:22:19.800
 I like, chew glass and look into the abyss.

2:22:21.600 --> 2:22:23.980
 That's much more fun than it sounds.

2:22:25.760 --> 2:22:27.400
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

2:22:27.400 --> 2:22:29.040
 Why are we here?

2:22:29.040 --> 2:22:29.960
 Life.

2:22:29.960 --> 2:22:31.760
 Yep, what's the meaning of life?

2:22:31.760 --> 2:22:34.120
 What's this existence we got?

2:22:34.120 --> 2:22:36.380
 You're trying to increase the amount of economic freedom

2:22:36.380 --> 2:22:38.240
 on this planet or trying to alleviate

2:22:38.240 --> 2:22:39.500
 some of the suffering.

2:22:39.500 --> 2:22:40.340
 Yeah.

2:22:40.340 --> 2:22:41.840
 But why?

2:22:41.840 --> 2:22:44.400
 I don't really think there is any point to life.

2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:49.200
 You know, somebody once told me,

2:22:50.600 --> 2:22:51.680
 you know, if you go into these like,

2:22:51.680 --> 2:22:54.600
 kind of really big existential questions,

2:22:54.600 --> 2:22:55.680
 it can get a little scary

2:22:55.680 --> 2:22:58.160
 because like you stare off the cliff

2:22:58.160 --> 2:22:59.360
 and there's like, there's nothing there.

2:22:59.360 --> 2:23:03.920
 You know, this one person told me one time they were like,

2:23:03.920 --> 2:23:08.180
 you know, Brian, you should probably snorkel, don't scuba.

2:23:08.180 --> 2:23:11.380
 I guess, and I think they were trying to say like,

2:23:11.380 --> 2:23:13.080
 I, some of my friends have done this, right?

2:23:13.080 --> 2:23:16.940
 They'll go to like, you know, epic meditation retreats

2:23:16.940 --> 2:23:19.360
 and like, they'll kind of come back

2:23:19.360 --> 2:23:21.580
 with all this existential dread of like,

2:23:21.580 --> 2:23:22.420
 what's the meaning of it all.

2:23:22.420 --> 2:23:24.120
 And then like, as far as I can tell,

2:23:24.120 --> 2:23:27.740
 we are just some organic molecules in the ocean

2:23:27.740 --> 2:23:30.000
 started like dividing and replicating

2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:32.500
 and the selfish gene and all this stuff,

2:23:32.500 --> 2:23:34.600
 like basically ended up here.

2:23:34.600 --> 2:23:38.080
 And our only, it's some kind of like really naive algorithm

2:23:38.080 --> 2:23:39.760
 that's just kind of trying to get us

2:23:39.760 --> 2:23:40.960
 to survive and replicate.

2:23:40.960 --> 2:23:43.600
 And we have DNA just like every other animal.

2:23:43.600 --> 2:23:45.240
 And so we happened to develop

2:23:45.240 --> 2:23:46.920
 these like really cool neocortexes.

2:23:46.920 --> 2:23:48.600
 And so now we're sort of self aware

2:23:48.600 --> 2:23:51.000
 and we have all these big questions

2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:54.080
 and maybe we'll create another, you know,

2:23:54.080 --> 2:23:55.000
 as computers get better,

2:23:55.000 --> 2:23:57.080
 we'll create the simulation inside our thing.

2:23:57.080 --> 2:23:58.780
 And I think it's cool.

2:23:58.780 --> 2:23:59.800
 Like we should basically,

2:23:59.800 --> 2:24:02.680
 I just want to keep watching the movie, you know, unfold.

2:24:02.680 --> 2:24:04.640
 That's part of why I want to work on,

2:24:04.640 --> 2:24:05.920
 like New Limit is really cool.

2:24:05.920 --> 2:24:07.720
 Cause it's helped, if people can live longer,

2:24:07.720 --> 2:24:10.680
 whether that's uploading their brain to the cloud

2:24:10.680 --> 2:24:14.300
 or, you know, basically through we get biology to work

2:24:14.300 --> 2:24:17.140
 or the strong AI to work or whatever.

2:24:17.140 --> 2:24:18.760
 One of those two hopefully works out.

2:24:18.760 --> 2:24:20.680
 And then we get to keep watching the movie

2:24:20.680 --> 2:24:22.160
 and see how it all unfolds.

2:24:22.160 --> 2:24:23.360
 I think that's fun.

2:24:23.360 --> 2:24:25.640
 And so I don't know if that's like an answer,

2:24:25.640 --> 2:24:27.640
 but I guess I don't think there's any real purpose.

2:24:27.640 --> 2:24:28.640
 So just try to have fun.

2:24:28.640 --> 2:24:32.760
 Well, the cool thing is that we get to write the movie

2:24:32.760 --> 2:24:34.480
 as we watch it.

2:24:34.480 --> 2:24:36.640
 Yeah, that's exactly right.

2:24:36.640 --> 2:24:38.680
 I mean, that's like the Steve Jobs quote and all that,

2:24:38.680 --> 2:24:40.400
 where he's like, everything around you was invented

2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:42.400
 by somebody who just was like,

2:24:42.400 --> 2:24:43.560
 this was a crazy idea they thought up.

2:24:43.560 --> 2:24:48.560
 So once you realize you can kind of do anything you want,

2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:53.040
 then that's what you start to go,

2:24:53.040 --> 2:24:55.120
 you start to go try crazier stuff.

2:24:55.120 --> 2:24:57.720
 I mean, this is another one of those areas where,

2:24:57.720 --> 2:24:58.560
 not to get too out there,

2:24:58.560 --> 2:25:00.280
 but like, you know, when you're,

2:25:00.280 --> 2:25:02.060
 I think you can build your comfort zone

2:25:02.060 --> 2:25:03.980
 around like people being upset with you.

2:25:03.980 --> 2:25:06.940
 You can also build your range

2:25:06.940 --> 2:25:08.180
 of what you think is possible, right?

2:25:08.180 --> 2:25:10.480
 Like when I was in my 20s,

2:25:10.480 --> 2:25:12.160
 I was like reading all these books

2:25:12.160 --> 2:25:13.880
 about like self improvement and goal,

2:25:13.880 --> 2:25:15.080
 how to write down your goals and stuff.

2:25:15.080 --> 2:25:17.960
 And my goals were like,

2:25:17.960 --> 2:25:21.920
 someday I wanna make $100,000 a year or something like,

2:25:21.920 --> 2:25:24.560
 and that was, and you know,

2:25:25.420 --> 2:25:28.080
 and it seemed like a little outlandish or what,

2:25:28.080 --> 2:25:28.980
 I wrote down these goals,

2:25:28.980 --> 2:25:31.680
 like I wanna own rental property or something anyway.

2:25:31.680 --> 2:25:35.120
 And then I slowly started to get some of these things done

2:25:35.120 --> 2:25:35.960
 over a couple of years.

2:25:35.960 --> 2:25:38.460
 And so I started to think a little bigger.

2:25:38.460 --> 2:25:41.060
 I remember one time I wrote down this goal where I was like,

2:25:41.060 --> 2:25:42.920
 what's the craziest thing I could think of?

2:25:42.920 --> 2:25:44.680
 And I was like, what if I, I wanna write,

2:25:44.680 --> 2:25:47.320
 I wanna start a billion dollar tech company.

2:25:47.320 --> 2:25:48.240
 That's crazy.

2:25:48.240 --> 2:25:50.960
 And I had never started like a million dollar tech company

2:25:50.960 --> 2:25:52.200
 or any tech company really.

2:25:52.200 --> 2:25:54.960
 So what business did I have writing that goal down?

2:25:54.960 --> 2:25:58.440
 I remember I wrote that on a piece of paper like,

2:25:58.440 --> 2:26:00.980
 like probably every day for a year or something almost,

2:26:00.980 --> 2:26:01.820
 right?

2:26:01.820 --> 2:26:02.640
 I don't know if it was every day,

2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:03.680
 but like I wrote it down a lot.

2:26:03.680 --> 2:26:06.680
 And so little things started to happen.

2:26:06.680 --> 2:26:07.560
 I was like, all right,

2:26:07.560 --> 2:26:09.280
 well, maybe I should move back to the Bay area

2:26:09.280 --> 2:26:10.120
 from Buenos Aires.

2:26:10.120 --> 2:26:13.080
 Maybe I should try to apply to Y Combinator or whatever.

2:26:13.080 --> 2:26:15.280
 Like, and I started thinking about these ideas.

2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:16.960
 And so whatever it gets you fired up,

2:26:16.960 --> 2:26:18.760
 it doesn't have to be like some company goal

2:26:18.760 --> 2:26:19.600
 or startup thing.

2:26:19.600 --> 2:26:21.620
 It could be anything, right?

2:26:21.620 --> 2:26:22.600
 Maybe you wanna publish a book

2:26:22.600 --> 2:26:25.120
 or like do something creatively or whatever.

2:26:25.120 --> 2:26:30.120
 Anyway, I think like within seven years, no,

2:26:32.160 --> 2:26:33.280
 it's probably more like 10 years

2:26:33.280 --> 2:26:34.780
 of me writing that goal down.

2:26:36.160 --> 2:26:38.800
 Coinbase had a valuation over a billion dollars.

2:26:38.800 --> 2:26:42.880
 So it was out of my realm of what was even possible.

2:26:42.880 --> 2:26:44.640
 And then within 10 years,

2:26:44.640 --> 2:26:46.680
 you can accomplish more in 10 years than you think,

2:26:46.680 --> 2:26:48.480
 less in a year than you think.

2:26:48.480 --> 2:26:51.680
 So now I'm like, okay, what's the next goal?

2:26:51.680 --> 2:26:55.640
 What's the, okay, maybe I wanna get a billion people

2:26:55.640 --> 2:26:57.580
 accessing the open financial system

2:26:57.580 --> 2:27:00.040
 through our products every day.

2:27:00.040 --> 2:27:01.680
 That would be cool for humanity.

2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:03.480
 And that's a pretty crazy goal.

2:27:03.480 --> 2:27:05.080
 Like there's only 8 billion people or something, right?

2:27:05.080 --> 2:27:06.520
 So there's one out of eight.

2:27:07.940 --> 2:27:09.760
 Or maybe I can radically,

2:27:09.760 --> 2:27:12.780
 like if I make some like the right investments or whatever,

2:27:12.780 --> 2:27:16.580
 I can like help radically extend human health span

2:27:16.580 --> 2:27:17.480
 or whatever, right?

2:27:18.840 --> 2:27:21.240
 So try crazier stuff.

2:27:21.240 --> 2:27:22.520
 I don't know, even if it doesn't work,

2:27:22.520 --> 2:27:27.520
 like hopefully you'll advance the state of affairs,

2:27:27.560 --> 2:27:29.120
 like something interesting will happen.

2:27:29.120 --> 2:27:31.160
 And so most people today,

2:27:31.160 --> 2:27:33.500
 they look at people trying this stuff and they're like,

2:27:33.500 --> 2:27:35.800
 oh my God, they're so, they're a genius or whatever.

2:27:35.800 --> 2:27:37.040
 And it's like, or they're an idiot.

2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:39.600
 Like one of the two, neither one are true.

2:27:39.600 --> 2:27:42.020
 It's just like anybody can start

2:27:42.020 --> 2:27:45.200
 by thinking about what they want and then like go for it.

2:27:45.200 --> 2:27:46.400
 And then once you get that,

2:27:46.400 --> 2:27:47.480
 like go for something a little bigger

2:27:47.480 --> 2:27:48.920
 and like you just have fun with it.

2:27:48.920 --> 2:27:53.560
 And the universe is a way of smiling and helping you out

2:27:53.560 --> 2:27:57.440
 if you just write it down and you dream big.

2:27:57.440 --> 2:27:59.800
 There's something about just karma,

2:27:59.800 --> 2:28:03.000
 about the energy you put into this world.

2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:05.240
 Other people will help you out, doors will open.

2:28:05.240 --> 2:28:07.460
 You'll notice that the doors opened

2:28:07.460 --> 2:28:10.600
 and you actually have a shot at making it happen.

2:28:10.600 --> 2:28:12.240
 It's a funny world.

2:28:12.240 --> 2:28:14.360
 Yeah, I mean, I don't really subscribe

2:28:14.360 --> 2:28:16.040
 to all like the woo woo interpretations of this,

2:28:16.040 --> 2:28:18.360
 but my very rational brain interpretation of it

2:28:18.360 --> 2:28:20.200
 is that if you just wake up every day

2:28:20.200 --> 2:28:22.160
 and write down like what you want to get done

2:28:22.160 --> 2:28:24.400
 and towards your longer goals, your larger goals,

2:28:24.400 --> 2:28:26.580
 it's just on your mind that day.

2:28:26.580 --> 2:28:28.040
 So you start to notice opportunities

2:28:28.040 --> 2:28:29.380
 and you think about it more.

2:28:29.380 --> 2:28:32.080
 So Brian, thank you for dreaming big.

2:28:32.080 --> 2:28:33.440
 Thank you for doing what you're doing,

2:28:33.440 --> 2:28:35.660
 doing incredible engineering at scale,

2:28:37.140 --> 2:28:39.600
 trying to help people from all over the world

2:28:39.600 --> 2:28:43.360
 and actually helping me personally get more into crypto

2:28:43.360 --> 2:28:46.400
 just cause it's so easy.

2:28:46.400 --> 2:28:48.080
 So thank you so much.

2:28:48.080 --> 2:28:49.600
 And thank you so much

2:28:49.600 --> 2:28:51.920
 for giving your extremely valuable time today

2:28:51.920 --> 2:28:53.320
 to this awesome conversation.

2:28:53.320 --> 2:28:55.080
 Thanks for your awesome podcast.

2:28:55.080 --> 2:28:57.560
 I love it and I listen to it often.

2:28:57.560 --> 2:28:59.000
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:00.520
 with Brian Armstrong.

2:29:00.520 --> 2:29:01.720
 To support this podcast,

2:29:01.720 --> 2:29:04.320
 please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:29:04.320 --> 2:29:06.200
 And now let me leave you with some words

2:29:06.200 --> 2:29:08.300
 from Benjamin Franklin.

2:29:08.300 --> 2:29:13.000
 An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.

2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:18.000
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
