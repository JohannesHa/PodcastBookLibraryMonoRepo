00:00.000 --> 00:02.680
 The following is a conversation with Andrew Huberman,

00:02.680 --> 00:04.560
 his second time on the podcast.

00:04.560 --> 00:06.480
 He's a neuroscientist at Stanford,

00:06.480 --> 00:08.800
 a world class researcher and educator,

00:08.800 --> 00:11.920
 and now he has a new podcast on YouTube

00:11.920 --> 00:15.260
 and all the usual places called Huberman Lab

00:15.260 --> 00:18.120
 that I can't recommend highly enough.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.200
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:20.200 --> 00:24.240
 Masterclass Online Courses for Sigmatic Mushroom Coffee,

00:24.240 --> 00:26.400
 Magic Spoon Low Carb Cereal,

00:26.400 --> 00:28.680
 and BetterHelp Online Therapy.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.360
 By the way, Masterclass is testing to see

00:34.360 --> 00:36.880
 if they want to support this podcast long term.

00:36.880 --> 00:40.280
 So if you're on the fence, now is the time to sign up.

00:40.280 --> 00:42.160
 And I'm pretty sure Andrew will have

00:42.160 --> 00:44.640
 a neuroscience masterclass on there soon enough,

00:44.640 --> 00:46.320
 though his podcast is basically

00:46.320 --> 00:48.840
 a weekly masterclass in itself.

00:48.840 --> 00:52.080
 As a side note, let me say that Andrew is a friend

00:52.080 --> 00:53.760
 and a new collaborator.

00:53.760 --> 00:55.600
 We're working on a paper together

00:55.600 --> 00:58.500
 about a topic we're both really passionate about.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.380
 At the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning.

01:01.380 --> 01:04.640
 But that's probably many months away from being published.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.800
 Still, I'm really excited about this work.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.680
 He's one of the smartest and kindest people

01:08.680 --> 01:11.080
 I have the pleasure of talking to on this podcast,

01:11.080 --> 01:14.380
 so I hope we'll talk many more times in the future.

01:14.380 --> 01:16.640

01:23.680 --> 01:27.260
 And now, here's my conversation with Andrew Huberman.

01:27.260 --> 01:30.500
 Why do humans need sleep?

01:30.500 --> 01:33.540
 Let's go with a big first question.

01:33.540 --> 01:36.920
 Okay, well, the answer I'll start with

01:36.920 --> 01:38.620
 is the one that I always default to

01:38.620 --> 01:40.940
 when there's a why question,

01:40.940 --> 01:44.260
 which is I wasn't consulted at the design phase.

01:44.260 --> 01:49.260
 So I wriggle my way out of giving a absolute answer, right?

01:50.580 --> 01:55.140
 But there's one mechanism that's very clear

01:55.140 --> 01:56.300
 that's super important,

01:56.300 --> 01:59.140
 which is that the longer we are awake,

01:59.140 --> 02:04.100
 the more adenosine accumulates in our brain.

02:04.100 --> 02:07.480
 And adenosine binds to adenosine receptors,

02:07.480 --> 02:08.600
 no surprise there,

02:08.600 --> 02:12.420
 and it creates the feeling of sleepiness

02:12.420 --> 02:15.720
 independent of time of day or night.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.340
 So there are two mechanisms.

02:17.340 --> 02:22.100
 One is we get sleepy as adenosine accumulates.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.220
 The longer we've been awake,

02:23.220 --> 02:26.200
 the more adenosine has accumulated in our system.

02:26.200 --> 02:31.200
 But how sleepy we get for a given amount of adenosine

02:31.500 --> 02:34.700
 depends on where we are in this so called circadian cycle.

02:34.700 --> 02:35.860
 And the circadian cycle

02:35.860 --> 02:39.300
 is just this very, very well conserved oscillation.

02:39.300 --> 02:41.100
 It's a temperature oscillation

02:41.100 --> 02:42.860
 where you go from a low point.

02:42.860 --> 02:44.500
 Typically, if you're awake during the day

02:44.500 --> 02:45.980
 and you're asleep at night,

02:45.980 --> 02:50.660
 your lowest temperature point will be like 3 a.m., 4 a.m.,

02:50.660 --> 02:52.660
 and then your temperature will start to creep up

02:52.660 --> 02:53.900
 as you wake up in the morning,

02:53.900 --> 02:56.420
 and then it'll peak in the late afternoon,

02:56.420 --> 02:58.500
 and then it'll start to drop again toward the evening,

02:58.500 --> 02:59.660
 and then you get sleep again.

02:59.660 --> 03:03.500
 That oscillation in temperature takes 24 hours.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.340
 Plus or minus.

03:04.340 --> 03:05.160
 Plus your temperature.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.620
 Yeah, plus or minus an hour.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.380
 And I don't,

03:08.380 --> 03:10.620
 even though I wasn't consulted at the design phase,

03:10.620 --> 03:12.700
 I do not think it's a coincidence

03:12.700 --> 03:16.300
 that it's aligned to the 24 hour spin of the Earth

03:16.300 --> 03:17.340
 on its axis.

03:17.340 --> 03:20.460
 The fact that we tend to be bathed in sunlight

03:20.460 --> 03:22.460
 for a portion of that spin,

03:22.460 --> 03:24.340
 and in darkness for the other portion of that spin.

03:24.340 --> 03:25.340
 So there are two mechanisms,

03:25.340 --> 03:28.880
 the adenosine accumulation and the circadian time point

03:28.880 --> 03:29.720
 that we happen to be at.

03:29.720 --> 03:32.680
 And those converge to create a sense

03:32.680 --> 03:34.060
 of sleepiness, awakefulness.

03:34.060 --> 03:37.140
 The simple way to reveal these two mechanisms,

03:37.140 --> 03:39.860
 to uncouple them, is stay up for 24 hours,

03:39.860 --> 03:42.420
 and you will find that even though you've been,

03:42.420 --> 03:46.260
 let's say you stay up midnight, 2 a.m., 3 a.m.,

03:46.260 --> 03:48.260
 provided you're on a regular schedule,

03:48.260 --> 03:50.980
 like that I follow, not like the kind that you follow,

03:50.980 --> 03:55.300
 I will get very sleepy around 3, 4 a.m.,

03:55.300 --> 03:58.220
 but then around 5 or 6 or 7 a.m.,

03:58.220 --> 03:59.700
 which is my normal wake up time,

03:59.700 --> 04:01.740
 I'll start to feel more alert,

04:01.740 --> 04:06.020
 even though adenosine has been accumulating further.

04:06.020 --> 04:08.940
 So adenosine is higher for me the longer I stay up,

04:08.940 --> 04:11.020
 and yet I feel more alert than I did a few hours ago.

04:11.020 --> 04:13.660
 And that's because these are two interacting forces.

04:13.660 --> 04:15.340
 So adenosine makes you sleepy,

04:15.340 --> 04:17.620
 and then just how sleepy or how awake you feel

04:17.620 --> 04:19.020
 also depends on where you are

04:19.020 --> 04:21.260
 in this temperature oscillation that takes 24 hours.

04:21.260 --> 04:22.300
 Okay, so that's fascinating.

04:22.300 --> 04:24.700
 So there's a bunch of oscillations going on,

04:24.700 --> 04:28.180
 and then they kind of, through the evolutionary process,

04:28.180 --> 04:30.700
 have evolved to all be aligned somewhat,

04:30.700 --> 04:31.580
 and they interplay.

04:31.580 --> 04:35.980
 So you said your body temperature goes up and down.

04:35.980 --> 04:40.580
 There's chemicals in your brain that oscillate,

04:40.580 --> 04:42.220
 and then there's the actual oscillation

04:42.220 --> 04:46.220
 of the sun in the sky.

04:46.220 --> 04:51.220
 So all of that together has some impact on each other,

04:52.700 --> 04:55.220
 and somehow that all results in us

04:55.220 --> 04:57.300
 wanting to go to sleep every night.

04:57.300 --> 05:00.100
 Right, so, and we can get right into the meat of this,

05:00.100 --> 05:01.540
 so I guess we just dove right in,

05:01.540 --> 05:05.500
 but the temperature oscillation

05:05.500 --> 05:08.100
 is the effector of the circadian clock.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.460
 So every cell in our body has a 24 hour rhythm

05:10.460 --> 05:14.660
 that's dictated by genes like clock, purr, BMAL.

05:14.660 --> 05:16.460
 This is one of the great successes of biology.

05:16.460 --> 05:18.620
 They give a Nobel prize to Rappert,

05:18.620 --> 05:19.900
 I don't know if Rappert got it, forgive me,

05:19.900 --> 05:22.500
 but sorry if you got it, Steve, congratulations.

05:22.500 --> 05:25.300
 If you didn't, I'm sorry, I wasn't on the committee.

05:25.300 --> 05:28.980
 Nonetheless, did beautiful work, Steve Rappert and others,

05:28.980 --> 05:31.740
 but Mike Roshbosh and other people worked out

05:31.740 --> 05:34.140
 these mechanisms in flies and bacteria and mammals.

05:34.140 --> 05:37.420
 There are these genes that create 24 hour oscillations

05:37.420 --> 05:40.580
 in gene expression, et cetera, in every cell of our body.

05:40.580 --> 05:43.220
 But what aligns those is a signal

05:43.220 --> 05:44.620
 from the master circadian clock,

05:44.620 --> 05:46.180
 which sits right above the roof of the mouth,

05:46.180 --> 05:48.660
 called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.

05:48.660 --> 05:53.040
 And that clock synchronizes all the clocks of the body

05:53.040 --> 05:55.920
 to this general temperature rhythm

05:55.920 --> 05:59.020
 by way of controlling systemic temperature,

05:59.020 --> 06:00.060
 which makes perfect sense.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.260
 If you want to create a general oscillation

06:02.260 --> 06:05.580
 in all the tissues and organs of the body, use temperature.

06:05.580 --> 06:07.780
 And so that work on temperature,

06:07.780 --> 06:08.980
 if people want to explore it further,

06:08.980 --> 06:11.300
 was Joe Takahashi, who was at Northwestern,

06:11.300 --> 06:14.460
 now at UT Southwestern in Dallas.

06:14.460 --> 06:18.280
 And it is absolutely clear that humans do better

06:18.280 --> 06:20.540
 on a diurnal schedule, sorry, Lex,

06:20.540 --> 06:23.340
 than a nocturnal schedule, because you could say,

06:23.340 --> 06:27.460
 well, provided I sleep and push adenosine back downhill,

06:27.460 --> 06:28.540
 which is what happens when we sleep,

06:28.540 --> 06:30.380
 adenosine is then reduced.

06:30.380 --> 06:33.500
 And provided I am on more or less a 24 hour schedule,

06:33.500 --> 06:35.760
 why should it matter that I'm awake when the sun's out

06:35.760 --> 06:38.700
 and I'm asleep when the sun is down?

06:38.700 --> 06:41.880
 But it turns out that if you look at health metrics,

06:41.880 --> 06:46.100
 people that are strictly nocturnal do far worse

06:46.100 --> 06:49.260
 on immune function, on metabolic function, et cetera,

06:49.260 --> 06:50.580
 than people who are diurnal,

06:50.580 --> 06:51.740
 who are awake during the daytime.

06:51.740 --> 06:54.540
 And animals that are nocturnal, it's the opposite.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.660
 And animals that are so called crepuscular,

06:56.660 --> 06:59.660
 which tend to be active at dawn and at dusk,

06:59.660 --> 07:02.120
 this is a beautiful system, I won't go down that rabbit hole,

07:02.120 --> 07:05.400
 but these are animals whose visual systems operate best.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.660
 They tend to be predators like mountain lions.

07:07.660 --> 07:10.300
 They have optimized their waking times

07:10.300 --> 07:12.740
 for the times when the animals they eat

07:12.740 --> 07:15.340
 can't see well in those light conditions.

07:15.340 --> 07:18.020
 But given the rod cone ratios in their eyes,

07:18.020 --> 07:20.020
 that the mountain lion is picking off.

07:20.020 --> 07:22.260
 It's like when you see a special forces

07:22.260 --> 07:24.680
 and they are looking through night vision goggles

07:24.680 --> 07:26.800
 and they have a clear advantage, right?

07:26.800 --> 07:28.220
 They are seeing in the dark.

07:28.220 --> 07:30.420
 That's basically what it's like to be a mountain lion

07:30.420 --> 07:32.880
 as opposed to a bunny rabbit.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.860
 Would you say that a lot of these cycles evolved

07:35.860 --> 07:38.140
 in the predator prey relationships

07:38.140 --> 07:39.900
 of the different throughout the food chain?

07:39.900 --> 07:43.180
 So it's basically all somehow has to do with survival

07:43.180 --> 07:46.940
 in this complicated web of predators and prey.

07:46.940 --> 07:49.220
 Almost certainly, there had to have been a time

07:49.220 --> 07:52.500
 in which humans being awake and active at night,

07:52.500 --> 07:54.700
 as opposed to during the day,

07:54.700 --> 07:58.180
 led to higher levels of lethality.

07:58.180 --> 08:00.300
 And probably particular in kids,

08:00.300 --> 08:01.900
 you imagine kids running around in the dark

08:01.900 --> 08:03.740
 and getting that where there are a lot of animals

08:03.740 --> 08:05.620
 that can see really well under those conditions

08:05.620 --> 08:06.620
 and humans can't.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.620
 And this would be all preelectricity.

08:08.620 --> 08:10.040
 Even if you're carrying a torch,

08:10.040 --> 08:12.180
 I mean, the range of illumination on a torch

08:12.180 --> 08:16.900
 is nothing compared to what a nighttime predator,

08:16.900 --> 08:19.380
 like a large cat or something can do.

08:19.380 --> 08:21.140
 I mean, they basically, they can see everything they need to

08:21.140 --> 08:24.260
 in order to eat us and not the other way around.

08:24.260 --> 08:26.380
 So one fascinating thing you said

08:26.380 --> 08:30.840
 is that blew my mind and we went right past it,

08:30.840 --> 08:35.560
 which is the temperature is a really powerful,

08:35.560 --> 08:37.620
 like if you were to think about the ways

08:37.620 --> 08:38.940
 that different parts of the body,

08:38.940 --> 08:40.540
 different systems in the body

08:40.540 --> 08:42.440
 would communicate with each other,

08:42.440 --> 08:46.020
 temperature would be a really good one.

08:46.020 --> 08:48.580
 And that just, I mean, maybe it's obvious,

08:48.580 --> 08:51.020
 but it kind of blew my mind just now

08:51.020 --> 08:55.620
 that yeah, these systems are all distributed.

08:55.620 --> 08:58.020
 And they have to kind of,

08:58.020 --> 08:59.680
 they're not actually sending signals,

08:59.680 --> 09:00.820
 but they're coordinating.

09:00.820 --> 09:05.460
 They need some sort of universal thing to look at

09:05.460 --> 09:06.980
 in order to coordinate.

09:06.980 --> 09:11.020
 And temperature is a nice one to build around.

09:11.020 --> 09:14.260
 And that way you could control the behavior

09:14.260 --> 09:15.420
 of all these different systems

09:15.420 --> 09:17.340
 by controlling the temperature.

09:17.340 --> 09:20.060
 Right, it's attractive to think of a mechanism

09:20.060 --> 09:23.340
 where this master circadian clock secretes a peptide

09:23.340 --> 09:25.520
 or something that goes and locks to receptors

09:25.520 --> 09:27.380
 in all the cells and gets it just right.

09:27.380 --> 09:30.020
 But that leaves far too much room for variability,

09:30.020 --> 09:33.780
 binding affinities, cells in a lot of parts of our body

09:33.780 --> 09:35.540
 are at different stages of maturation.

09:35.540 --> 09:37.820
 They're turning over liver cells and so forth.

09:37.820 --> 09:40.260
 And for instance, we have a clock in our gut

09:40.260 --> 09:43.500
 and in our liver such that if we were just take out

09:43.500 --> 09:45.560
 your liver and put it on a table

09:45.560 --> 09:47.340
 and just look at the expression of these genes,

09:47.340 --> 09:49.620
 it would be in a 24 hour oscillation on its own.

09:49.620 --> 09:52.300
 It's independent, but something has to entrain them

09:52.300 --> 09:53.580
 and keep them all synchronized.

09:53.580 --> 09:55.820
 And so it's not obvious that it would be temperature.

09:55.820 --> 09:58.420
 Takahashi's great gift to biology was to show

09:58.420 --> 10:03.420
 that all the stuff coming out of this master circadian clock

10:03.420 --> 10:05.900
 at the end of the day, that's a weird statement,

10:05.900 --> 10:08.700
 no pun intended, at the end of the day and the night,

10:08.700 --> 10:13.220
 at the end of the story, it all boils down to making sure

10:13.220 --> 10:15.380
 that the temperature of tissues oscillates

10:15.380 --> 10:16.700
 in the same fashion.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.900
 That's blowing my mind and thinking like

10:18.900 --> 10:21.740
 what other mechanism could possibly exist

10:21.740 --> 10:23.740
 to create that kind of oscillation.

10:23.740 --> 10:26.860
 Well, you're Russian, it's cold in Russia

10:26.860 --> 10:27.680
 for a lot of the year.

10:27.680 --> 10:29.740
 The hibernation signal in certain animals

10:29.740 --> 10:30.940
 is a remarkable signal.

10:30.940 --> 10:34.140
 There are peptides secreted from this very same clock

10:34.140 --> 10:37.700
 that in animals like ground squirrels or bears,

10:37.700 --> 10:39.860
 they go into a kind of a torpor

10:39.860 --> 10:42.260
 where everything, reproduction, metabolism,

10:42.260 --> 10:44.260
 everything is reduced while they're in their cave.

10:44.260 --> 10:46.460
 They don't actually stay asleep all of winter.

10:46.460 --> 10:47.600
 That's a myth.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.940
 And they actually do these very dramatic

10:50.940 --> 10:53.460
 and periodic arousals from hibernation

10:53.460 --> 10:54.860
 where they just shake and shake and shake.

10:54.860 --> 10:55.700
 It looks like a seizure.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.700
 And then they go back under into the torpor.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.220
 That's from a peptide that's released.

11:00.220 --> 11:01.060
 But that's different

11:01.060 --> 11:03.620
 because that's about shutting down the whole system.

11:03.620 --> 11:06.780
 It's clear that having these very regular oscillations

11:06.780 --> 11:09.440
 every 24 hours is essential for everything

11:09.440 --> 11:11.720
 from metabolism to reproduction.

11:13.020 --> 11:17.220
 Is there an optimal temperature for sleep

11:17.220 --> 11:19.460
 that I should mention?

11:19.460 --> 11:21.360
 I think your latest episode,

11:22.420 --> 11:24.940
 you and people should go check out

11:24.940 --> 11:29.420
 helixsleep.com slash Huberman to support Andrew.

11:29.420 --> 11:30.460
 Thanks for the plug.

11:30.460 --> 11:34.100
 I mean, the amazing thing about this stuff

11:34.100 --> 11:34.940
 that you're creating,

11:34.940 --> 11:37.020
 oh, and yes, you have a new podcast.

11:37.020 --> 11:37.840
 That's amazing.

11:37.840 --> 11:41.500
 In this past month, you did a whole series on sleep,

11:41.500 --> 11:44.080
 which people should definitely check out.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.780
 There's some podcasts that come out

11:47.820 --> 11:51.220
 that just make me want to be a better human being

11:51.220 --> 11:53.280
 by just the quality.

11:53.280 --> 11:57.160
 Three Blue One Brown, Grant Sanderson is like that for me.

11:57.160 --> 12:00.780
 Just like, wow, this is education is best.

12:00.780 --> 12:05.520
 So Andrew symbolizes that, captures that brilliantly.

12:05.520 --> 12:06.780
 So go support the sponsor

12:06.780 --> 12:09.060
 so he doesn't stop doing the thing.

12:09.060 --> 12:11.820
 So I think they have a cooling pad too.

12:11.820 --> 12:15.000
 So the 8 Sleep Mattress sponsors me.

12:17.580 --> 12:19.700
 They sent me a mattress and it's been,

12:19.700 --> 12:23.280
 I've never, listen, I used to sleep on the floor.

12:23.280 --> 12:24.540
 Sleep where you fall.

12:24.540 --> 12:25.460
 Sleep where I fall.

12:25.460 --> 12:26.340
 I don't give a shit.

12:26.340 --> 12:27.860
 It doesn't really matter.

12:27.860 --> 12:32.260
 But so like, I would have never bought a nice mattress

12:32.260 --> 12:33.140
 because it's like, why?

12:33.140 --> 12:33.980
 I'm fine.

12:33.980 --> 12:35.740
 This is a floor, it's fine.

12:35.740 --> 12:40.420
 But it was a game changer to be able to control temperature.

12:40.420 --> 12:41.960
 Like for me, it's cooling.

12:43.060 --> 12:44.500
 I don't know what the hell it is.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.900
 Well, you want the brain and nervous system

12:46.900 --> 12:48.380
 and rest of the body needs to drop

12:48.380 --> 12:50.580
 by about anywhere from two to three degrees

12:50.580 --> 12:52.580
 in order to get into your deepest sleep

12:52.580 --> 12:54.100
 and transition to sleep.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.060
 That's really going to help.

12:55.060 --> 12:57.620
 You don't want to be cold that you're bothered

12:57.620 --> 12:58.660
 and can't fall asleep.

12:58.660 --> 13:00.820
 But that's why some people like it really cold in the room

13:00.820 --> 13:02.980
 and under a warm blanket or with socks on,

13:02.980 --> 13:05.740
 for some people that can be good

13:05.740 --> 13:08.220
 because this temperature oscillation is such

13:08.220 --> 13:10.540
 that as your temperature is dropping,

13:10.540 --> 13:13.980
 that correlates generally with the most sleepy phase

13:13.980 --> 13:16.180
 of your circadian cycle.

13:16.180 --> 13:18.980
 So cool is better for falling and staying asleep

13:18.980 --> 13:20.060
 and sleeping deeply.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.820
 And then I guess like that's what 8 Sleep showed.

13:22.820 --> 13:27.560
 They have like an app is it warms back up to wake you up.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.620
 The idea that I haven't actually used it.

13:29.620 --> 13:31.000
 I'm like, this is stupid.

13:32.720 --> 13:33.760
 People say it works,

13:33.760 --> 13:36.900
 but I just keep it the same temperature throughout the night

13:36.900 --> 13:40.740
 but warming it up, I guess wakes you up,

13:40.740 --> 13:42.600
 which is fascinating.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.140
 Yeah, because the wake up signal is,

13:45.140 --> 13:47.580
 it's interesting to think about it's not just correlated

13:47.580 --> 13:49.020
 with an increase in body temperature.

13:49.020 --> 13:50.860
 The increase in body temperature

13:50.860 --> 13:53.820
 is triggering the release of cortisol from your adrenals.

13:53.820 --> 13:55.380
 And that's the wake up signal.

13:55.380 --> 13:57.540
 Do you think it's absolute temperatures we're talking about

13:57.540 --> 13:59.220
 or is it just even relative?

13:59.220 --> 14:00.820
 Just even just the decrease.

14:00.820 --> 14:01.660
 Well, everyone's gonna have

14:01.660 --> 14:03.300
 slightly different basal temperature.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.800
 The idea that everybody should be 98.6.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.220
 I mean, that's a myth.

14:07.220 --> 14:09.820
 And there are theories that body temperature overall

14:09.820 --> 14:12.020
 has been dropping in the last 50 years or so.

14:12.020 --> 14:15.000
 I doubt that's true for somebody who is athletic like you

14:15.000 --> 14:17.340
 and is young and healthy.

14:17.340 --> 14:22.340
 But basically the coldest period of that 24 hour cycle

14:22.500 --> 14:24.820
 is when you are going to be sleepiest.

14:24.820 --> 14:27.220
 There's actually a period within that 24 hour cycle,

14:27.220 --> 14:29.860
 it's a time point called your temperature minimum.

14:29.860 --> 14:33.860
 And your temperature minimum tends to be about two hours

14:33.860 --> 14:36.180
 before your typical wake up time.

14:36.180 --> 14:37.300
 I'm not talking about the wake up time

14:37.300 --> 14:39.020
 in the middle of the night where you go use the bathroom

14:39.020 --> 14:40.580
 or where you set an alarm to go catch a flight.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.200
 I mean, if you were to just allow yourself

14:42.200 --> 14:44.740
 to sleep without a clock for a few days,

14:44.740 --> 14:46.260
 measure when you typically wake up,

14:46.260 --> 14:48.620
 two hours before then is your temperature minimum.

14:48.620 --> 14:50.540
 And that temperature minimum turns out to be

14:50.540 --> 14:54.820
 a very important landmark in your circadian cycle

14:54.820 --> 14:59.180
 because it turns out that if you get bright light

14:59.180 --> 15:02.740
 in your eyes in the hours immediately

15:02.740 --> 15:04.520
 before your temperature minimum,

15:05.500 --> 15:09.180
 so two to four hours or anytime within the two

15:09.180 --> 15:11.120
 or four hour window before that temperature minimum,

15:11.120 --> 15:14.340
 you are going to what's called delay your circadian clock.

15:14.340 --> 15:16.480
 The next day, that whole oscillation

15:16.480 --> 15:18.060
 is going to move forward.

15:18.060 --> 15:21.000
 It'll make you want to go to sleep later and wake up later.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.780
 Whereas if you get bright light in your eyes

15:22.780 --> 15:26.140
 in the hours after that temperature minimum,

15:26.140 --> 15:28.660
 so let's say for me, typical wake up time is 6 a.m.,

15:28.660 --> 15:30.780
 my temperature minimum somewhere around 4 a.m.

15:30.780 --> 15:34.560
 If I get bright light in my eyes, 5 a.m., 6 a.m., 7 a.m.,

15:34.560 --> 15:37.580
 it's going to advance that oscillation

15:37.580 --> 15:39.260
 so that I'll want to go to bed earlier

15:39.260 --> 15:41.780
 and wake up earlier the subsequent nights.

15:41.780 --> 15:44.100
 So you might say, wait, but most nights

15:44.100 --> 15:46.380
 I go to sleep and wake up at more or less the same time.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.220
 Why is that?

15:47.220 --> 15:48.860
 And that's because the same thing

15:48.860 --> 15:49.980
 is happening on both sides.

15:49.980 --> 15:52.180
 You are both advancing your clock a little bit

15:52.180 --> 15:55.140
 and assuming that you're looking at light in the evening,

15:55.140 --> 15:57.100
 you're also delaying your clock a little bit.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.660
 So you get kind of captured in between

15:58.660 --> 16:01.140
 and then your rhythm more or less oscillates

16:01.140 --> 16:05.020
 at the same period, as we say, as the spin of the earth.

16:05.020 --> 16:07.020
 Unless you're like you where you're,

16:07.020 --> 16:10.140
 I get text messages from you sometimes at odd hours

16:10.140 --> 16:12.060
 and if you're on the East Coast,

16:12.060 --> 16:14.180
 then I know that you had to have been pulling

16:14.180 --> 16:15.020
 basically an all nighter.

16:15.020 --> 16:18.340
 Yeah, yeah, that's the interesting point

16:18.340 --> 16:21.420
 about the messiness of sleep.

16:21.420 --> 16:24.300
 So most people seem to perform the best

16:24.300 --> 16:26.600
 when they have like a regular sleep schedule.

16:28.060 --> 16:32.420
 I perhaps am the same, but I don't know that.

16:32.420 --> 16:36.700
 And I tend to believe that you can also perform

16:36.700 --> 16:40.840
 relatively optimally with chaos of sleep,

16:40.840 --> 16:45.840
 of like a weird soup of like power naps

16:47.500 --> 16:49.540
 and all nighters and all of that,

16:49.540 --> 16:54.540
 as long as you're like happy doing what you love.

16:56.060 --> 17:01.060
 And maybe you can tell me what you think about this.

17:01.780 --> 17:06.540
 So I tend to, for myself, try to minimize stress in life.

17:06.540 --> 17:10.780
 So what I found for myself with diet,

17:10.780 --> 17:15.420
 with sleep is that if I obsess about it being perfect,

17:15.420 --> 17:18.620
 then I'll actually stress quite a bit when it's not.

17:18.620 --> 17:23.620
 Like I'll feel shitty when I don't get enough sleep

17:24.460 --> 17:27.420
 because I know I should be getting more sleep

17:27.420 --> 17:30.600
 as opposed to the actual physiological effects

17:30.600 --> 17:32.200
 of not getting enough sleep.

17:32.200 --> 17:35.100
 I find if I just accept whatever the hell happens,

17:35.100 --> 17:39.420
 happens and smile and just take it all in,

17:39.420 --> 17:42.620
 like David Goggins style, like if it sucks,

17:42.620 --> 17:45.180
 it's even better or what is it,

17:45.180 --> 17:47.300
 Jocko's like good or whatever he says.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.900
 I think there are several things

17:49.900 --> 17:51.060
 that you said that are important,

17:51.060 --> 17:55.760
 but I agree that one can have a dysregulated sleep schedule

17:55.760 --> 17:58.420
 and still be a happy person and productive.

17:58.420 --> 18:00.200
 Much of my life, I've pulled all nighters

18:00.200 --> 18:03.220
 and slept weird schedules.

18:03.220 --> 18:06.520
 I think many people can probably relate to going to sleep,

18:06.520 --> 18:08.820
 waking up four hours later, being up for an hour or two

18:08.820 --> 18:10.260
 on your computer, then going back to sleep

18:10.260 --> 18:12.860
 and getting amazing sleep the next day functioning.

18:12.860 --> 18:17.020
 I think it's important that people have highlighted

18:17.020 --> 18:20.880
 the importance of sleep and getting enough rest.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.960
 I do think it's gone too far

18:22.960 --> 18:24.580
 and now I'm editorializing a little bit,

18:24.580 --> 18:28.540
 but I think that we've created this anxiety about sleep

18:28.540 --> 18:30.820
 that if we don't sleep enough, we're going to get dementia.

18:30.820 --> 18:31.660
 If we don't get sleep,

18:31.660 --> 18:36.200
 then the reproductive access is going to completely crash.

18:36.200 --> 18:40.700
 There's a lot of evidence to the contrary and as well,

18:40.700 --> 18:42.240
 just based on personal experience

18:42.240 --> 18:44.680
 and based on the fact that sure,

18:44.680 --> 18:46.760
 it may be that a solid eight hours

18:46.760 --> 18:50.480
 with no interruptions in there or nine or 10

18:50.480 --> 18:51.660
 could do great benefit,

18:51.660 --> 18:54.460
 but you can do really well if you do what you say,

18:54.460 --> 18:55.960
 which is you wake up,

18:55.960 --> 18:57.500
 you don't want to start stressing about it,

18:57.500 --> 19:00.020
 creating this meta stress about sleep.

19:00.020 --> 19:04.240
 Being happy is actually one of the most powerful things

19:04.240 --> 19:05.080
 that you can do,

19:05.080 --> 19:07.720
 allowing yourself to go down that rabbit hole of stress

19:07.720 --> 19:08.920
 for the following reason.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.140
 A lot of our fatigue is not due just to the buildup

19:13.140 --> 19:14.880
 of adenosine or time of day,

19:14.880 --> 19:16.500
 the circadian thing we were talking about earlier.

19:16.500 --> 19:21.420
 An additional factor is that effort is related

19:21.420 --> 19:22.600
 to the release of epinephrine,

19:22.600 --> 19:24.400
 of adrenaline in our brain and body.

19:25.360 --> 19:28.720
 At some point, those levels get so high

19:28.720 --> 19:32.280
 that we get stressed mentally,

19:32.280 --> 19:34.400
 we get stressed physically and we want to give up.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.200
 There are good data published in Cell

19:36.200 --> 19:39.240
 showing that that signal, the epinephrine signal,

19:39.240 --> 19:42.080
 eventually accumulates and there's a quit point.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.360
 Dopamine, the molecule of pursuit and reward

19:45.360 --> 19:49.820
 and feeling good, resets our ability to be in effort.

19:49.820 --> 19:52.240
 In fact, a lot of people don't know this,

19:52.240 --> 19:56.640
 but dopamine is actually what epinephrine is made from.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.260
 If you look at the biochemical cascade,

19:58.260 --> 19:59.540
 it starts with tyrosine,

19:59.540 --> 20:03.240
 which is found in red meats and things of that sort.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.200
 And tyrosine is eventually converted

20:05.200 --> 20:07.480
 through things like L dopa into dopamine.

20:07.480 --> 20:09.440
 Dopamine is made into epinephrine.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.760
 So, I mean, this sounds kind of new agey,

20:11.760 --> 20:16.120
 but happiness, joy and pleasure in what you're doing

20:16.120 --> 20:20.340
 creates a chemical milieu that provides more

20:20.340 --> 20:22.840
 of the chemicals that allow for effort.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.240
 And there's nothing new agey about that.

20:24.240 --> 20:26.080
 It's in every biochemistry textbook.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.140
 It's in every decent neuroscience textbook.

20:28.140 --> 20:29.600
 They just don't talk about the happiness part.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.400
 They just talk about the dopamine part.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.400
 So, I think that limiting your stress

20:33.400 --> 20:35.200
 and at least recognizing, okay,

20:35.200 --> 20:36.240
 if you're pulling an all nighter

20:36.240 --> 20:38.480
 or you're somehow on messed up sleep,

20:39.580 --> 20:43.360
 that there is going to be a point in that 24 hour cycle

20:43.360 --> 20:46.060
 where your brain is not trustworthy,

20:46.060 --> 20:50.700
 where your mental state is not worth placing too much weight

20:50.700 --> 20:53.360
 on because you are near that temperature minimum.

20:53.360 --> 20:54.880
 And near that temperature minimum,

20:54.880 --> 20:57.280
 which is correlates to that two hour,

20:57.280 --> 21:00.360
 about two hours before you would normally wake up,

21:00.360 --> 21:03.860
 the brain is hobbling along.

21:03.860 --> 21:06.880
 And anything you feel or think at that time

21:06.880 --> 21:09.420
 should not be given too much value.

21:09.420 --> 21:11.760
 But if you can trick yourself into thinking

21:11.760 --> 21:13.260
 that's the pleasure point,

21:13.260 --> 21:15.240
 you afford yourself a huge advantage.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.600
 There's a study done by a colleague of mine at Stanford

21:17.600 --> 21:20.560
 that showed that positive anticipation

21:20.560 --> 21:25.560
 about the next day events actually is a powerful metric

21:26.320 --> 21:29.400
 for creating quality sleep,

21:29.400 --> 21:31.640
 even if the sleep is very reduced.

21:31.640 --> 21:32.960
 And you'll love this one.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.040
 And a lot of people are going to,

21:35.040 --> 21:36.000
 might be critical of this.

21:36.000 --> 21:36.920
 So, I just want to make sure that,

21:36.920 --> 21:40.040
 so this is work done out of Harvard Medical.

21:40.040 --> 21:42.720
 It was Bob Stickgold's lab

21:42.720 --> 21:45.960
 and Emily Hoagland did this study that showed

21:45.960 --> 21:48.840
 looking at Ochem, performance on Ochem scores.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.080
 Okay, so organic chemistry at Harvard

21:50.080 --> 21:52.600
 is pretty tough subject, highly motivated,

21:52.600 --> 21:55.960
 a number of very good control groups in this study.

21:55.960 --> 22:00.000
 What she showed was that consistency of total sleep duration

22:00.000 --> 22:04.200
 was far more important for performance on these exams

22:04.200 --> 22:06.800
 than total sleep duration itself.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.720
 So it's not that just getting more sleep

22:08.720 --> 22:10.280
 allows you to perform better.

22:10.280 --> 22:13.680
 Consistently getting about the same amount of sleep

22:13.680 --> 22:17.720
 is better for performance, at least on Ochem,

22:17.720 --> 22:19.780
 than just getting more.

22:19.780 --> 22:20.620
 That's interesting.

22:20.620 --> 22:22.800
 So that's referring to more

22:22.800 --> 22:25.440
 that there should be a consistent habit

22:25.440 --> 22:27.880
 versus the total amount.

22:27.880 --> 22:31.160
 To me, like the entirety of the picture of sleep

22:31.160 --> 22:36.160
 is similar to nutrition in that it feels like it's,

22:38.400 --> 22:40.040
 there's so many variables involved

22:40.040 --> 22:42.360
 and it's so person specific.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.400
 So, you know, a lot of studies,

22:44.400 --> 22:45.920
 I mean, this is the way of science,

22:45.920 --> 22:49.520
 has to look in aggregate the effects on sleep.

22:49.520 --> 22:52.400
 It doesn't focus on high performers

22:52.400 --> 22:54.620
 which are individuals ultimately.

22:54.620 --> 22:57.000
 Like the question isn't,

22:57.960 --> 22:59.200
 so it's a very important question,

22:59.200 --> 23:04.200
 is like what kind of diet fights obesity, reduces obesity?

23:04.280 --> 23:05.440
 It's another question,

23:05.440 --> 23:07.760
 what kind of diet allows David Goggins

23:07.760 --> 23:09.240
 to be the best version of himself?

23:09.240 --> 23:11.800
 So these high performers in different avenues.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.180
 And the same thing with sleep,

23:13.180 --> 23:15.640
 like people that tell me

23:15.640 --> 23:17.640
 that I should get eight hours of sleep,

23:18.560 --> 23:23.420
 it's like, it's, I mean, I get it

23:23.420 --> 23:26.320
 and there may be right, but they may be very wrong.

23:26.320 --> 23:29.500
 There's no evidence that eight is better than six,

23:29.500 --> 23:33.440
 that you could very well do better on six than on eight.

23:33.440 --> 23:36.140
 There are a few other things that turn out to be

23:36.140 --> 23:38.440
 strong parameters for success in this domain.

23:38.440 --> 23:42.160
 For instance, your entire life, waking or asleep

23:42.160 --> 23:44.760
 is broken up into these 90 minute ultradian cycles.

23:44.760 --> 23:47.520
 If you look at ability to attend or do math problems

23:47.520 --> 23:50.060
 or do anything, you know, drive,

23:50.060 --> 23:54.020
 performance tends to ramp up slowly within a 90 minute cycle

23:54.020 --> 23:56.720
 peak and then come down at the end of that 90 minute cycle.

23:56.720 --> 23:59.920
 And in sleep, we go through these stage one, two, three,

23:59.920 --> 24:02.420
 four REM, et cetera, we'll talk more about that if you like,

24:02.420 --> 24:05.440
 those on 90 minute ultradian cycles as well.

24:05.440 --> 24:07.940
 Ending your sleep after a 90 minute cycle

24:07.940 --> 24:10.820
 at the near the end of a 90 minute cycle,

24:10.820 --> 24:12.500
 say at the end of six hours,

24:12.500 --> 24:14.960
 in many cases is better for you

24:14.960 --> 24:17.160
 than sleeping an additional hour, seven hours

24:17.160 --> 24:19.320
 and waking up in the middle of an ultradian cycle.

24:19.320 --> 24:21.200
 And there are a few apps that can measure this

24:21.200 --> 24:23.240
 based on body movements and things like that,

24:23.240 --> 24:25.800
 that have your alarm go off

24:25.800 --> 24:27.880
 at the end of an ultradian cycle.

24:27.880 --> 24:30.500
 And if you wake up in the middle of an ultradian cycle,

24:30.500 --> 24:32.600
 sometimes not always you can be very groggy

24:32.600 --> 24:34.260
 for a long period of time.

24:34.260 --> 24:37.560
 I certainly do better on six hours than I do on seven.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.580
 I happen to like an eight hour sleep, it feels great,

24:40.580 --> 24:43.020
 but I haven't slept an entire eight hours

24:43.020 --> 24:45.180
 without waking up in the middle of the night at some point

24:45.180 --> 24:48.000
 in, I don't know, forever.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.640
 I can't remember, it's probably some point in infancy.

24:51.640 --> 24:53.120
 And I function well during the day.

24:53.120 --> 24:57.220
 I think that that's an important parameter

24:57.220 --> 24:58.940
 is how do you feel during the day?

24:58.940 --> 25:02.040
 Almost everybody experiences some sort of dip in energy

25:02.040 --> 25:03.000
 in the late afternoon

25:03.000 --> 25:05.160
 or what would correlate to their temperature peak.

25:05.160 --> 25:06.680
 And that's a good time of day

25:06.680 --> 25:10.560
 to get either a 90 minute or less nap,

25:10.560 --> 25:13.960
 or if you're not a napper or you can't nap,

25:13.960 --> 25:18.960
 feet elevated has been shown to be good for clear out

25:19.040 --> 25:22.080
 of some of this, the glymphatic system

25:22.080 --> 25:23.560
 is this kind of like sewer system of the brain

25:23.560 --> 25:24.760
 that you can clear stuff out.

25:24.760 --> 25:29.080
 So legs elevated, or one thing that I'm a big proponent of

25:29.080 --> 25:30.200
 and that my lab has been studying

25:30.200 --> 25:34.300
 is what I now call NSDR, non sleep deep rest.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.360
 And this is just lying down.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.480
 There are some scripts that we're gonna put out there soon

25:38.480 --> 25:40.060
 as a free resource.

25:40.060 --> 25:41.280
 There's some hypnosis scripts

25:41.280 --> 25:42.840
 that my colleague David Spiegel has put out there

25:42.840 --> 25:44.080
 as a free resource,

25:44.080 --> 25:46.640
 but non sleep deep rest is allowing your system

25:46.640 --> 25:49.940
 to drop into states of a real calm

25:49.940 --> 25:52.480
 that allow you to get better at falling asleep later.

25:52.480 --> 25:53.820
 And they can be very restorative

25:53.820 --> 25:55.620
 for cognitive and motor function.

25:55.620 --> 25:58.040
 There's at least one study out of Denmark

25:58.040 --> 26:01.360
 that shows that the basal ganglia,

26:01.360 --> 26:02.320
 which is an area of the brain

26:02.320 --> 26:04.300
 that's involved in motor planning and action,

26:04.300 --> 26:07.380
 one of these 20 minute non sleep deep rest protocols

26:07.380 --> 26:09.280
 resets levels of neuromodulators

26:09.280 --> 26:10.820
 like dopamine and the basal ganglia

26:10.820 --> 26:13.220
 to the same levels that they were

26:13.220 --> 26:15.280
 right after a long night's sleep.

26:15.280 --> 26:20.280
 So I also respectfully or semi respectfully disagree

26:20.440 --> 26:23.120
 with the idea that you can't recover lost sleep.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.080
 What does that mean?

26:24.080 --> 26:26.200
 I mean, there's no IRS for sleep.

26:26.200 --> 26:29.220
 So what does it mean to be in debt for sleep?

26:29.220 --> 26:31.800
 If you're falling asleep during the day and you're sleepy,

26:31.800 --> 26:35.280
 like you're falling asleep, that's a good sign of insomnia.

26:35.280 --> 26:37.040
 It means you're not sleeping enough at night.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.720
 If you're fatigued during the day,

26:38.720 --> 26:40.240
 but you're not falling asleep,

26:40.240 --> 26:41.360
 so you're just exhausted,

26:41.360 --> 26:43.560
 but you're not finding yourself falling asleep in meetings

26:43.560 --> 26:45.080
 and in conversation,

26:45.080 --> 26:47.900
 then chances are you're fatiguing your system

26:47.900 --> 26:48.840
 through something else,

26:48.840 --> 26:52.600
 like a long run in the middle of the night in Austin

26:52.600 --> 26:55.500
 or whatever it is that you're up to lately at 3 a.m.

26:55.500 --> 26:58.040
 Yes, there is a magic to the nap.

26:58.040 --> 27:01.400
 And maybe you could speak to the,

27:01.400 --> 27:03.020
 because you mentioned these protocols

27:03.020 --> 27:06.840
 that don't necessarily, so they're non sleep.

27:06.840 --> 27:11.840
 But to me, the nap one or two a day

27:13.080 --> 27:16.400
 can almost irrespective of how much sleep

27:16.400 --> 27:17.760
 I get the night before,

27:18.620 --> 27:22.200
 have a fundamental change in my mood, in my performance.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.040
 For the better or for the worse?

27:23.040 --> 27:24.040
 For the better, for the better.

27:24.040 --> 27:24.960
 Yeah, likewise.

27:24.960 --> 27:29.780
 So I do tend to kind of experiment with durations.

27:29.780 --> 27:33.520
 It's consistently surprising to me

27:33.520 --> 27:36.640
 how like a nap of like 10 minutes,

27:36.640 --> 27:37.640
 I don't know, maybe you can speak

27:37.640 --> 27:39.700
 to the perfect duration of a nap,

27:39.700 --> 27:43.120
 but I find that it's like magic

27:43.120 --> 27:46.800
 that a short nap does as much good

27:46.800 --> 27:50.200
 and often better than a longer one, for me, for me,

27:50.200 --> 27:51.040
 subjectively speaking.

27:51.040 --> 27:51.960
 What would be a longer one?

27:51.960 --> 27:53.360
 Longer than 90 minutes?

27:53.360 --> 27:54.880
 No, no, like 90 minutes,

27:54.880 --> 27:57.080
 or a bit longer than 90 minutes, like two hours.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.780
 Yeah, that's starting to drop you into REM sleep.

27:59.780 --> 28:01.920
 And even if it's a tiny amount of REM sleep,

28:01.920 --> 28:04.680
 people can come out of those naps kind of disoriented.

28:04.680 --> 28:07.160
 I mean, remember, in sleep, space and time

28:07.160 --> 28:08.280
 are totally uncoupled.

28:08.280 --> 28:12.400
 And so that's an odd state to reenter the world in

28:12.400 --> 28:13.960
 if you're not gonna stay there for a while,

28:13.960 --> 28:15.240
 like for a good night's sleep.

28:15.240 --> 28:18.920
 I think a 20 minute nap is pretty fantastic.

28:18.920 --> 28:19.940
 Would you say that's the,

28:19.940 --> 28:21.960
 if you were to recommend to the general,

28:21.960 --> 28:24.720
 it's very weird to recommend anything

28:24.720 --> 28:25.920
 to the general populace,

28:25.920 --> 28:28.440
 because obviously it's very person specific,

28:28.440 --> 28:31.440
 but what's a good one will you say to friends?

28:31.440 --> 28:32.800
 Is 20 minutes a good powder?

28:32.800 --> 28:34.140
 20 or 30 minutes.

28:34.140 --> 28:34.980
 20 or 30 minutes,

28:34.980 --> 28:37.400
 because you're going, unless you're sleep deprived,

28:37.400 --> 28:40.080
 you're going to stay out of REM sleep,

28:40.080 --> 28:41.160
 rapid eye movement sleep.

28:41.160 --> 28:43.120
 If you're sleep deprived, you'll drop right into it.

28:43.120 --> 28:45.080
 If you've ever traveled and you're really jet lagged,

28:45.080 --> 28:46.960
 you go to the hotel, you lay down for one second,

28:46.960 --> 28:48.840
 all of a sudden you're just like,

28:48.840 --> 28:51.460
 you're in a psychedelic dream,

28:52.340 --> 28:54.160
 which can be pretty great too.

28:55.280 --> 28:58.360
 But I think that 20, 30 minutes,

28:58.360 --> 29:01.840
 and if you can't sleep, some people have trouble napping,

29:01.840 --> 29:03.760
 then learning to relax the body

29:03.760 --> 29:04.760
 as much as possible,

29:04.760 --> 29:07.160
 like trying to remove all expression from your face,

29:07.160 --> 29:10.080
 completely letting your body kind of float.

29:10.080 --> 29:13.360
 If people have a hard time relaxing when they're awake,

29:13.360 --> 29:15.680
 there's some terrific clinically

29:15.680 --> 29:18.480
 and research tested hypnosis protocols

29:18.480 --> 29:21.000
 that we could provide links to that are cost free

29:21.000 --> 29:23.300
 and that teach you how to just completely

29:24.520 --> 29:28.000
 release the alertness button and you just start drifting.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.160
 Now, the problem is if you don't have an alarm

29:31.160 --> 29:32.720
 or something to go off,

29:32.720 --> 29:34.080
 the other day I did one

29:34.080 --> 29:35.760
 and I'm almost embarrassed to say this,

29:35.760 --> 29:36.680
 but there's a component of it

29:36.680 --> 29:38.560
 where you actually are supposed to let your hand float up

29:38.560 --> 29:40.480
 because it's a hypnosis script.

29:40.480 --> 29:43.160
 So they, it's my colleague, David Spiegel in the script,

29:43.160 --> 29:46.140
 he says, let your hand float up.

29:46.140 --> 29:49.000
 I woke up an hour later and my hand was still floating.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.160
 Yeah, and I was completely relaxed.

29:52.160 --> 29:56.620
 So hypnosis is just a matter of going deep relaxation,

29:56.620 --> 29:59.560
 narrowing of context, and it's all self imposed.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.960
 A lot of people think that hypnosis is like the stage thing

30:01.960 --> 30:03.920
 with the pendant and the chicken,

30:03.920 --> 30:05.720
 people fucking like chickens,

30:05.720 --> 30:08.660
 but real hypnosis is self hypnosis.

30:08.660 --> 30:11.560
 You're learning to, it involves some shifts

30:11.560 --> 30:14.220
 in the way that you, the hypnotic induction involves

30:14.220 --> 30:16.760
 looking up, closing your eyes, slowly deep breath,

30:16.760 --> 30:19.200
 and then imagine yourself floating.

30:19.200 --> 30:23.040
 And people vary on a scale of about one to four,

30:23.040 --> 30:25.640
 four being the most easily hypnotized.

30:25.640 --> 30:27.440
 There are a few people who it's very hard for them

30:27.440 --> 30:29.920
 to allow themselves to go into these states,

30:29.920 --> 30:33.000
 but for most people, they just, they're gone.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.380
 And it's nice if you can have access to those states,

30:36.380 --> 30:39.320
 because when you come out of it, you feel amazing.

30:39.320 --> 30:40.720
 You feel like you slept the whole night,

30:40.720 --> 30:42.600
 at least most people report that.

30:42.600 --> 30:43.880
 So refresh, alert.

30:43.880 --> 30:44.720
 Ready to go.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.520
 I mean, basically you're ready.

30:46.520 --> 30:49.600
 Yeah, I know you have this interesting challenge coming up

30:49.600 --> 30:51.560
 and I'm curious what you're going to do to reset

30:51.560 --> 30:55.860
 in the hours, the frequency of running is every four hours.

30:55.860 --> 30:57.460
 It's not going to allow you to get any more

30:57.460 --> 30:59.360
 than a couple hours sleep in between.

30:59.360 --> 31:00.200
 Couple hours.

31:00.200 --> 31:01.160
 So we should tell it to people.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.800
 I'd be curious to get your thoughts and advice on it.

31:03.800 --> 31:08.800
 I'm on March 5th, running 48 miles with Mr. David Goggins.

31:10.280 --> 31:14.680
 So four miles every four hours and people should join us.

31:14.680 --> 31:19.280
 He's, that mad man is going to be live on Instagram

31:19.280 --> 31:23.360
 starting at 8 p.m. Pacific on March 5th.

31:23.360 --> 31:24.200
 So.

31:24.200 --> 31:25.100
 You're going to join him in person.

31:25.100 --> 31:26.020
 In person.

31:26.020 --> 31:27.200
 Undisclosed location.

31:27.200 --> 31:28.960
 Undisclosed location.

31:28.960 --> 31:31.040
 And I was trying to clarify like, okay,

31:31.040 --> 31:35.400
 so we're going to like, there'll be like friendly people

31:35.400 --> 31:36.440
 around or something.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.520
 No, it's just me and him.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.340
 Friendly people.

31:38.340 --> 31:39.180
 I don't know.

31:39.180 --> 31:42.520
 Like, I just feel it's very difficult to be

31:42.520 --> 31:45.600
 with David alone in a room.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.760
 I imagine his, I mean, I've done some work with David.

31:47.760 --> 31:49.480
 His energy is infectious.

31:49.480 --> 31:50.360
 Yeah.

31:50.360 --> 31:52.180
 That's an intense schedule.

31:53.040 --> 31:56.160
 And the periodicity of those four hour,

31:56.160 --> 31:58.240
 every four hours, four miles means

31:58.240 --> 31:59.600
 that there's no chance of catching

31:59.600 --> 32:01.760
 an extended block of sleep.

32:01.760 --> 32:04.120
 So it's about three hours that you have

32:04.120 --> 32:05.680
 non exercising every time.

32:05.680 --> 32:09.960
 And of course, it takes time to try to fall asleep

32:09.960 --> 32:11.800
 and there's an intensity to the whole thing.

32:11.800 --> 32:16.800
 I mean, it's probably impossible to get anything more

32:17.020 --> 32:19.860
 than two hours of sleep if you wanted to.

32:19.860 --> 32:23.200
 So the optimal thing is probably from the sound of it,

32:23.200 --> 32:25.280
 I'd be curious to see what you think,

32:25.280 --> 32:29.160
 but like it's getting a few 90 minute naps.

32:29.160 --> 32:31.440
 Okay, well, I thought about this a bit

32:31.440 --> 32:33.440
 before we met up today.

32:33.440 --> 32:35.800
 So I think there are two general approaches

32:35.800 --> 32:37.480
 that could work.

32:37.480 --> 32:40.300
 Neither one necessarily better than the other.

32:40.300 --> 32:44.800
 One would be just to hammer through the whole thing,

32:44.800 --> 32:49.320
 just to get your level of alertness and adrenaline ramped up

32:49.320 --> 32:52.320
 so that you don't expect yourself to sleep.

32:52.320 --> 32:53.680
 There are certain advantages there.

32:53.680 --> 32:56.240
 One is a subjective kind of emotional advantages,

32:56.240 --> 32:57.440
 which is if you can't sleep,

32:57.440 --> 32:59.520
 you're not gonna be stressed about that.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.800
 And if you do fall asleep, it's a bonus,

33:01.800 --> 33:03.520
 provided you wake up and you don't look up

33:03.520 --> 33:06.120
 and you realize David's been out running for half an hour

33:06.120 --> 33:07.480
 and you're behind, right?

33:07.480 --> 33:09.100
 But chances are, that's not the way it'll go.

33:09.100 --> 33:09.940
 You set an alarm.

33:09.940 --> 33:11.440
 So that's one approach.

33:12.640 --> 33:15.760
 And I grabbed that from a couple of friends

33:15.760 --> 33:18.880
 who were in the SEAL teams and they'll say that,

33:18.880 --> 33:20.720
 during BUDS, there's this infamous hell week

33:20.720 --> 33:23.040
 and there's this five days,

33:23.040 --> 33:25.040
 definitely five days of no sleep,

33:25.040 --> 33:27.320
 although there is a component where they offer a nap

33:27.320 --> 33:29.200
 at one particular point.

33:29.200 --> 33:32.680
 And a lot of people will say that it's worse

33:32.680 --> 33:36.480
 to go down for that nap and then be woken up 20 minutes later

33:36.480 --> 33:38.560
 than to just stay up.

33:38.560 --> 33:39.620
 So that's one option.

33:39.620 --> 33:43.420
 Let's call it the full blitz hammer through option.

33:43.420 --> 33:45.320
 And if you happen to fall asleep, you do.

33:45.320 --> 33:46.920
 It's a bonus.

33:46.920 --> 33:49.880
 The other one would be to really anchor

33:49.880 --> 33:51.120
 in these ultradian cycles.

33:51.120 --> 33:52.940
 So coming back from a run,

33:52.940 --> 33:55.440
 unless you're thoroughly exhausted,

33:55.440 --> 33:56.860
 you're probably going to have a few minutes

33:56.860 --> 33:58.760
 where you're going to want to stay awake.

33:58.760 --> 34:01.340
 It's going to be hard to just immediately fall asleep.

34:01.340 --> 34:04.040
 And getting as much sleep as you can

34:04.040 --> 34:06.140
 in the intervening periods,

34:06.140 --> 34:08.640
 provided that you guys aren't posting constantly

34:08.640 --> 34:10.080
 or doing something else.

34:10.080 --> 34:11.780
 There's a question of whether or not you want to nourish,

34:11.780 --> 34:14.560
 whether or not you want to eat or not in that time.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.320
 Anytime we put food in our gut,

34:16.320 --> 34:20.320
 I don't care if it's meat or oatmeal

34:20.320 --> 34:22.640
 or broccoli or cardboard,

34:22.640 --> 34:24.440
 you're drawing blood into the gut.

34:24.440 --> 34:27.200
 And so you are going to divert some energy

34:27.200 --> 34:29.320
 towards digestion and it's going to make you sleepy.

34:29.320 --> 34:31.080
 There's a reason why the rest and digest,

34:31.080 --> 34:33.560
 the parasympathetic nervous system is called that.

34:33.560 --> 34:36.840
 So you could decide that you were only going to sleep

34:36.840 --> 34:39.720
 in between certain blocks.

34:39.720 --> 34:42.760
 That would be another way to think about this.

34:42.760 --> 34:45.240
 Because I did this last year.

34:45.240 --> 34:47.260
 I ran very slow.

34:47.260 --> 34:48.460
 Some of it was walking.

34:48.460 --> 34:49.520
 I was listening to audio books.

34:49.520 --> 34:53.120
 And one of the biggest mistakes I did is to overeat

34:53.120 --> 34:54.160
 during that time.

34:54.160 --> 34:56.440
 It made the experience very unpleasant.

34:56.440 --> 35:00.220
 So I have been considering basically eating almost nothing

35:00.220 --> 35:01.360
 throughout the day.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.520
 Being fasted will increase alertness

35:03.520 --> 35:05.960
 because high levels of epinephrine in your system

35:05.960 --> 35:07.020
 from fasting.

35:07.020 --> 35:09.500
 You just think about fasting or being thirsty

35:09.500 --> 35:10.800
 before you get exhausted.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.840
 People always think if I don't eat, I'm going to be tired.

35:12.840 --> 35:15.800
 No, the energy that you derive from food

35:15.800 --> 35:19.600
 is going to be used from glycogen after a long storage

35:19.600 --> 35:20.560
 and conversion process.

35:20.560 --> 35:23.440
 So the food that you eat is going to consume energy

35:23.440 --> 35:24.720
 to digest.

35:24.720 --> 35:26.880
 And so a lot of people feel better fasted.

35:26.880 --> 35:29.320
 And presumably throughout history,

35:29.320 --> 35:31.080
 people have fasted for long periods of time

35:31.080 --> 35:32.760
 and had to stay up for two or three days.

35:32.760 --> 35:35.700
 And God forbid, if a family member is sick,

35:35.700 --> 35:38.160
 you can stay awake in the hospital without any trouble.

35:38.160 --> 35:41.480
 So that alertness system, it's all mental.

35:42.680 --> 35:45.200
 Actually, and then there's a third.

35:45.200 --> 35:48.880
 So you could try and sleep or take care in between.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.400
 And then there's a third approach.

35:51.400 --> 35:54.480
 But I didn't come up with it, but David did.

35:54.480 --> 35:57.160
 So I actually texted him earlier

35:57.160 --> 35:58.920
 because I had a feeling that I heard

35:58.920 --> 36:01.000
 that you were going to do this challenge.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.680
 So I asked David.

36:05.520 --> 36:08.800
 So these are David Goggins words, not mine.

36:09.600 --> 36:14.040
 One, being organized is super important.

36:14.040 --> 36:17.760
 Two, you want to waste as little time as possible.

36:17.760 --> 36:21.400
 Three, you need to eat, sleep and rehab

36:21.400 --> 36:22.760
 in as little time as possible

36:22.760 --> 36:25.160
 so you can sleep as much as possible.

36:25.160 --> 36:26.000
 Interesting.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.960
 By the way, this is the first time I'm reading this.

36:28.960 --> 36:32.920
 Four, meal prep and gear prep, et cetera, are very important.

36:32.920 --> 36:36.200
 That's consistent with everything I know about military.

36:36.200 --> 36:39.600
 They don't leave too much to chance.

36:39.600 --> 36:42.520
 Five, again, these are David's words.

36:42.520 --> 36:45.000
 All that said, he's fucked on most all that

36:45.000 --> 36:47.480
 because he'll be interviewing me before or after.

36:47.480 --> 36:49.600
 I will also be interviewing him.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.280
 Oh, shit.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.000
 Five, long story short,

36:53.000 --> 36:55.640
 the only thing that might help is a very special pill.

36:55.640 --> 36:57.520
 Ooh, this is interesting.

36:57.520 --> 36:59.880
 They're called SIU pills.

36:59.880 --> 37:02.120
 Hard to get, but I believe he can get them.

37:02.120 --> 37:04.360
 SIU stands for suck it up.

37:06.040 --> 37:07.800
 Tell him to grab his balls.

37:07.800 --> 37:09.360
 He will find those pills there.

37:09.360 --> 37:13.160
 That's number six, all right.

37:13.160 --> 37:15.680
 And then the last one, stay hard, brother.

37:15.680 --> 37:16.720
 Stay hard, brother.

37:17.680 --> 37:19.000
 Amen.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.080
 That was one of the other things

37:21.080 --> 37:22.800
 that I think makes this challenging

37:22.800 --> 37:25.920
 is that it'll be doing a podcast throughout.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.640
 So first of all, I'll do a long one before and after,

37:28.640 --> 37:31.960
 but also I'll have to come up

37:31.960 --> 37:34.360
 with things to talk to him about.

37:34.360 --> 37:39.360
 So it's a different thing to do something privately

37:40.280 --> 37:41.160
 and then publicly.

37:41.160 --> 37:43.040
 I know it doesn't seem that way,

37:43.040 --> 37:46.560
 but one of the hardest,

37:46.560 --> 37:49.400
 the hardest thing I had to do last time

37:49.400 --> 37:52.440
 was to turn on the camera and talk to the camera

37:52.440 --> 37:54.600
 because last time I did it,

37:54.600 --> 37:57.880
 I recorded every single time I did a leg,

37:57.880 --> 38:00.120
 I recorded something I'm grateful for.

38:00.120 --> 38:01.800
 It's just kind of unrelated.

38:01.800 --> 38:05.120
 I'm not a fan of talking about how I'm feeling

38:05.120 --> 38:06.760
 or how the run is going.

38:06.760 --> 38:10.400
 I want to do something totally unrelated to the run

38:10.400 --> 38:12.800
 and with the run as the background,

38:12.800 --> 38:14.240
 sort of something I'm grateful for

38:14.240 --> 38:16.760
 or just any kind of interesting discussion.

38:16.760 --> 38:20.240
 Gratitude, I mean, I hate the word hack,

38:20.240 --> 38:22.680
 like, oh, it's a dopamine hack or it's a serotonin.

38:22.680 --> 38:24.680
 I don't like the word hack because A,

38:24.680 --> 38:27.240
 it's disrespectful to hackers who do a real thing

38:27.240 --> 38:31.640
 and B, a hack implies that it's some sort of trick

38:31.640 --> 38:35.080
 that you're kind of gaming the system.

38:35.080 --> 38:38.000
 You know, what works is mechanism, right?

38:38.000 --> 38:41.520
 Biological mechanisms were designed to work

38:41.520 --> 38:44.000
 and they were selected for to work

38:44.000 --> 38:45.920
 under variable conditions.

38:45.920 --> 38:47.000
 And as you know, and I know,

38:47.000 --> 38:49.360
 and we have great appreciation for the fact

38:49.360 --> 38:50.880
 that the nervous system was designed

38:50.880 --> 38:52.320
 to be an adaptive machine

38:52.320 --> 38:55.720
 so that you don't have to sleep eight hours every night.

38:55.720 --> 38:57.840
 You can do this thing.

38:57.840 --> 39:00.920
 And things like gratitude allow you to tap

39:00.920 --> 39:03.520
 into chemical resources.

39:03.520 --> 39:04.960
 And that's not a hack.

39:04.960 --> 39:07.400
 The fact that being grateful for something external

39:07.400 --> 39:10.680
 to the event happens to release serotonin

39:10.680 --> 39:13.720
 and have a certain soothing effect or a dopamine

39:13.720 --> 39:16.920
 and give you more epinephrine and let you go further,

39:16.920 --> 39:18.040
 that's not a hack.

39:18.040 --> 39:21.000
 That's actually what allowed the human machine

39:21.000 --> 39:23.160
 to evolve to the point that it is now.

39:23.160 --> 39:26.280
 Every time, you know, an inventor eventually

39:26.280 --> 39:28.720
 created something that worked and felt great about it,

39:28.720 --> 39:31.160
 you can imagine that the first, you know,

39:31.160 --> 39:33.320
 air flight felt pretty awesome

39:33.320 --> 39:35.840
 and motivated those people to go on and do more.

39:35.840 --> 39:39.200
 They didn't just go on, you know, yawn and go have a beer.

39:39.200 --> 39:44.000
 So being able to access the genuine internal states

39:44.000 --> 39:46.800
 of gratitude and reward works.

39:46.800 --> 39:48.600
 You can't trick the system.

39:48.600 --> 39:50.800
 You can't pretend that you're grateful for something,

39:50.800 --> 39:52.720
 but if you can identify or attach yourself

39:52.720 --> 39:55.200
 to some larger goal or something

39:55.200 --> 39:57.160
 that's deeply gratifying to you,

39:57.160 --> 40:00.840
 or place it in service to a relative that passed away

40:00.840 --> 40:04.480
 that you care a lot about, that's not a hack.

40:04.480 --> 40:07.160
 That's accessing the deepest components

40:07.160 --> 40:08.360
 of your nervous system.

40:08.360 --> 40:10.480
 And to steal your kind of lingo,

40:10.480 --> 40:12.320
 you know, there's real beauty there, right?

40:12.320 --> 40:15.920
 Yeah, but for an introvert like myself,

40:15.920 --> 40:17.960
 and I think David, I don't know if he's an introvert,

40:17.960 --> 40:21.960
 but like, he's not, despite the fact

40:21.960 --> 40:24.720
 that he has written a great book and he communicates,

40:24.720 --> 40:25.840
 he puts himself out there,

40:25.840 --> 40:28.600
 he's not really a fan of communication.

40:28.600 --> 40:31.280
 He's not, I don't know if he's energized

40:31.280 --> 40:33.760
 by speaking his mind.

40:33.760 --> 40:34.960
 I don't know him well enough to know.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.800
 I mean, we've done a little bit of work together

40:36.800 --> 40:38.960
 and, you know, we're in communication now and again.

40:38.960 --> 40:40.560
 He's obviously super impressive.

40:41.600 --> 40:42.440
 I don't know.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.840
 It seems like he's a pretty private guy.

40:44.840 --> 40:47.920
 Yeah, so like, you know, so I don't have access to that.

40:47.920 --> 40:50.040
 So for me, I'll just speak to myself,

40:50.040 --> 40:51.240
 and I think David is the same,

40:51.240 --> 40:55.200
 but I'll speak to myself that it was a hugely draining thing,

40:55.200 --> 40:57.920
 not to experience the gratitude,

40:57.920 --> 41:00.400
 experiencing the gratitude just like you're saying

41:00.400 --> 41:04.560
 is really energizing, and it's a powerful thing.

41:04.560 --> 41:08.360
 It's a, it can lift up your mood.

41:08.360 --> 41:12.760
 But to turn on the camera and have to use words,

41:12.760 --> 41:14.160
 which is very difficult to do,

41:14.160 --> 41:18.360
 to explain like what you're feeling

41:18.360 --> 41:20.040
 and do it in a way that you know

41:20.040 --> 41:23.640
 a bunch of people will be watching is really draining.

41:23.640 --> 41:26.200
 And one of the things I'm concerned about

41:26.200 --> 41:29.200
 that in this whole process,

41:29.200 --> 41:32.200
 how do I keep my mind sharp

41:32.200 --> 41:35.840
 while also keeping the physical performance sharp?

41:35.840 --> 41:38.000
 And that's a little bit scary

41:38.000 --> 41:42.640
 because talking to David like actual intellectually sharp,

41:42.640 --> 41:47.640
 like thinking, being charismatic as much as I can be,

41:47.640 --> 41:51.320
 and like being so maintaining a sense of humor too,

41:51.320 --> 41:54.360
 because I can be, I become with sleep deprivation,

41:54.360 --> 41:56.840
 with exhaustion, you start being.

41:56.840 --> 41:58.080
 The Russian bear comes out.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.960
 You start being such a,

41:59.960 --> 42:03.200
 like I become a David Goggins essentially like.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.440
 Oh, it makes you irritable.

42:04.440 --> 42:06.520
 Sleep deprivation makes us irritable.

42:06.520 --> 42:07.440
 Yeah.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.760
 It's clear so that in the early part of the night,

42:09.760 --> 42:12.640
 we get a higher percentage of those old Tradian cycles

42:12.640 --> 42:15.320
 are occupied by slow wave sleep,

42:15.320 --> 42:17.120
 sometimes just called non REM sleep.

42:17.120 --> 42:21.280
 And those early night sleep bouts

42:21.280 --> 42:23.640
 are great for muscular repair

42:23.640 --> 42:25.480
 and for certain forms of learning,

42:25.480 --> 42:27.960
 but REM sleep, the rapid eye movement sleep,

42:27.960 --> 42:29.440
 which it starts to accumulate

42:29.440 --> 42:32.400
 and occupy more of those 90 minute old Tradian cycles

42:32.400 --> 42:34.960
 toward the late part of a sleep bout.

42:34.960 --> 42:37.520
 So typically toward morning,

42:37.520 --> 42:40.440
 but toward after you've been asleep a while,

42:40.440 --> 42:42.760
 that's when you do the emotional processing.

42:42.760 --> 42:47.000
 That's when we recover the ability to feel refreshed

42:47.000 --> 42:48.480
 and not irritated by things.

42:48.480 --> 42:50.720
 And if you deprive people of REM sleep,

42:50.720 --> 42:55.720
 they become selectively bad at uncoupling the emotion

42:56.520 --> 42:58.320
 from things that happened in the previous days.

42:58.320 --> 43:00.680
 So the little things start to seem like big things.

43:00.680 --> 43:05.040
 I always know I'm REM sleep deprived when I'm irritable.

43:05.040 --> 43:07.640
 And when I look at like the word the,

43:07.640 --> 43:09.040
 and it doesn't look like it's spelled right.

43:09.040 --> 43:10.320
 And I'm kind of pissed off about it.

43:10.320 --> 43:11.200
 Like something's off.

43:11.200 --> 43:15.240
 And we actually are becoming slightly psychotic

43:15.240 --> 43:16.920
 when we're REM sleep deprived.

43:16.920 --> 43:18.760
 You're not going to get a lot of REM sleep in this thing,

43:18.760 --> 43:20.240
 except as you fatigue more,

43:20.240 --> 43:21.080
 if you do fall asleep,

43:21.080 --> 43:22.480
 you're going to drop more and more into REM

43:22.480 --> 43:24.120
 so that those 90 minute cycles,

43:24.120 --> 43:26.040
 you won't have to go through stage one,

43:26.040 --> 43:27.880
 stage two, stage three, and then REM,

43:27.880 --> 43:30.160
 you're just going to drop right into REM.

43:30.160 --> 43:33.680
 So you can count on your system to compensate for you.

43:33.680 --> 43:35.960
 But I think that just the knowledge

43:35.960 --> 43:38.440
 that you tend to get irritable as the time goes on,

43:38.440 --> 43:40.280
 just that third personing of yourself,

43:40.280 --> 43:42.120
 that awareness, the observer,

43:42.120 --> 43:43.360
 that can be very beneficial

43:43.360 --> 43:46.160
 because there may be bouts during this event

43:46.160 --> 43:49.160
 when you just should probably say nothing.

43:49.160 --> 43:51.440
 And maybe you just, I don't know,

43:51.440 --> 43:55.560
 smile and record or not smile or do whatever it is

43:55.560 --> 43:57.520
 because you're going to be conserving energy.

43:57.520 --> 43:58.800
 If it feels like a grind,

43:58.800 --> 44:00.640
 that's epinephrine being released.

44:00.640 --> 44:02.840
 That's epinephrine that you could devote

44:02.840 --> 44:04.560
 to the physical effort.

44:04.560 --> 44:06.840
 But humor is an amazing anecdote for this

44:06.840 --> 44:09.000
 because it resets that,

44:09.000 --> 44:10.800
 it's that dopamine release

44:10.800 --> 44:13.080
 that gives us that fresh perspective.

44:13.080 --> 44:15.360
 And it's a real chemical thing.

44:15.360 --> 44:17.200
 It's not a hack.

44:17.200 --> 44:18.640
 It's not a trick.

44:18.640 --> 44:20.320
 It's not a visualization.

44:20.320 --> 44:22.640
 It's biology in action.

44:22.640 --> 44:27.640
 Well, but I think the act of interviewing,

44:28.080 --> 44:29.920
 of conversation in these processes,

44:29.920 --> 44:32.200
 even if you don't want to do it,

44:32.200 --> 44:35.520
 the right thing to do, even when you're feeling irritable,

44:35.520 --> 44:39.200
 is to do the third person view

44:39.200 --> 44:41.080
 and be able to express with words

44:41.080 --> 44:42.880
 that you're feeling irritable.

44:42.880 --> 44:45.920
 Like express what you're going through.

44:45.920 --> 44:48.880
 Use words, which I hate doing.

44:48.880 --> 44:50.720
 I honestly, I think my ultimate thing

44:50.720 --> 44:53.600
 would be just to never say a single word to David Gagas

44:53.600 --> 44:55.280
 and just go through hell.

44:55.280 --> 44:57.080
 It doesn't matter what we do,

44:57.080 --> 45:00.280
 but to do it quietly, to also express it.

45:00.280 --> 45:01.800
 That's my ultimate hell.

45:01.800 --> 45:02.640
 And I think that's...

45:02.640 --> 45:03.480
 Well, he's definitely going to be,

45:03.480 --> 45:04.680
 if I know David at all,

45:04.680 --> 45:06.600
 he's going to try and find your buttons.

45:06.600 --> 45:08.840
 Like he's going to, I mean,

45:08.840 --> 45:10.960
 even though he knows he can complete this,

45:10.960 --> 45:13.880
 and I believe that he trusts that you can complete it too,

45:13.880 --> 45:15.920
 I believe you will complete it.

45:15.920 --> 45:17.320
 You know you will complete it, right.

45:17.320 --> 45:18.640
 There's no question about that.

45:18.640 --> 45:20.280
 But he's not going to make it easier for you.

45:20.280 --> 45:21.400
 He's going to make it harder.

45:21.400 --> 45:22.240
 Well, I'm afraid.

45:22.240 --> 45:25.000
 So I'm like, it's very difficult for me.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.880
 So 48 miles is not easy.

45:26.880 --> 45:28.320
 I have not been training that much.

45:28.320 --> 45:30.200
 So I'm not ramping up,

45:30.200 --> 45:34.120
 but it's not like going to kill me.

45:34.120 --> 45:34.960
 We'll see what happens.

45:34.960 --> 45:37.240
 Of course, for him, he might always get bored

45:37.240 --> 45:40.720
 because I think the 48 miles for him is easy.

45:40.720 --> 45:41.560
 I think...

45:41.560 --> 45:45.640
 I don't know that that ever gets easy.

45:45.640 --> 45:48.400
 I have a friend, Casey Cordial, who works with David.

45:48.400 --> 45:53.400
 He does some physical rehab type stuff with him.

45:53.480 --> 45:55.960
 And he took Casey on a 50 miler

45:55.960 --> 45:57.960
 and Casey said it's like 16 miles and do it.

45:57.960 --> 46:00.720
 He was just like, he had hit his wall,

46:00.720 --> 46:02.480
 but he found it.

46:02.480 --> 46:06.120
 They find it to get, you know, you find that portal.

46:06.120 --> 46:07.480
 There is one thing I want to mention.

46:07.480 --> 46:10.000
 There's some very good physiology

46:10.000 --> 46:12.920
 that can perhaps support the actual running effort part.

46:12.920 --> 46:14.640
 These are very new data.

46:14.640 --> 46:17.880
 We have a study going on with David Spiegel at Stanford,

46:17.880 --> 46:19.800
 looking at how different patterns of breathing

46:19.800 --> 46:21.800
 can affect heart rate variability.

46:21.800 --> 46:23.400
 Heart rate variability is good.

46:23.400 --> 46:25.160
 There's this interesting mechanism

46:25.160 --> 46:27.040
 that I think most people might not realize,

46:27.040 --> 46:29.220
 but that medical students learn that your breathing

46:29.220 --> 46:31.600
 and your heart rate and your brain

46:31.600 --> 46:33.480
 are in this really remarkable interplay.

46:33.480 --> 46:34.400
 It goes like this.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.320
 When you inhale, this isn't breath work.

46:36.320 --> 46:37.440
 We're not going to do breath work.

46:37.440 --> 46:40.860
 But when you inhale, the diaphragm moves down.

46:42.320 --> 46:43.360
 The heart gets a little bigger

46:43.360 --> 46:45.640
 because there's a little more space in the thoracic cavity.

46:45.640 --> 46:49.200
 And as a consequence, blood flows a little bit more slowly

46:49.200 --> 46:50.760
 through that larger volume.

46:50.760 --> 46:53.760
 And there's a category of neurons, the sinonitrile node,

46:53.760 --> 46:58.440
 that sees that, that recognizes that slower rate

46:58.440 --> 46:59.600
 through that larger volume.

46:59.600 --> 47:01.000
 It sends a signal to the brainstem

47:01.000 --> 47:02.760
 and the brainstem sends a signal back to the heart

47:02.760 --> 47:04.360
 to speed the heart up.

47:04.360 --> 47:06.240
 So every time you inhale, you're speeding the heart up.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.400
 When you exhale, the diaphragm moves up,

47:08.400 --> 47:10.680
 the heart gets a little smaller, the volume is smaller,

47:10.680 --> 47:12.640
 blood flows more quickly through the heart,

47:12.640 --> 47:13.840
 signal sent up to the brain,

47:13.840 --> 47:17.860
 and the brain sends a signal back to slow the heart down.

47:17.860 --> 47:20.580
 This is the basis of heart rate variability.

47:20.580 --> 47:23.260
 So at any point, if you feel like your heart is racing

47:23.260 --> 47:25.280
 and you feel like you're working too hard

47:25.280 --> 47:27.440
 per unit of effort,

47:27.440 --> 47:30.400
 focus on making your exhales longer

47:30.400 --> 47:32.600
 or more intense than your inhales.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.760
 If ever you feel like you're truly flagging,

47:34.760 --> 47:36.640
 you do not have the energy to get up,

47:36.640 --> 47:39.440
 it's like, okay, it's time to go and you're exhausted,

47:39.440 --> 47:42.420
 you want to draw more oxygen into the system,

47:42.420 --> 47:44.360
 get your heart rate going faster.

47:44.360 --> 47:46.160
 Now, some people when they hear this probably think,

47:46.160 --> 47:47.260
 well, this is really obvious,

47:47.260 --> 47:49.020
 but there's so much out there about breath work

47:49.020 --> 47:50.280
 and how to breathe and all this stuff,

47:50.280 --> 47:52.480
 but no one talks about how to do it in real time

47:52.480 --> 47:53.880
 while you're exerting effort.

47:53.880 --> 47:57.920
 So this is something like almost like second by second,

47:57.920 --> 48:00.720
 you can adjust things just in real time

48:00.720 --> 48:01.760
 based on how you're feeling,

48:01.760 --> 48:03.200
 but based on the heart rate.

48:03.200 --> 48:04.040
 That's right.

48:04.040 --> 48:04.960
 The experience of the heart rate.

48:04.960 --> 48:05.800
 That's right.

48:05.800 --> 48:08.120
 So one thing that could be very efficient

48:08.120 --> 48:10.160
 and we're doing some work with athletes now,

48:10.160 --> 48:11.760
 so these are unpublished data,

48:11.760 --> 48:14.340
 but if you, while you're running,

48:14.340 --> 48:16.820
 if you want to get into a nice cadence

48:16.820 --> 48:19.600
 of heart rate variability, do double inhales

48:21.980 --> 48:23.040
 while you're running.

48:23.040 --> 48:25.260
 What this will do is that when you do the double inhale

48:25.260 --> 48:28.720
 has the effect of reopening the alveoli of the lungs,

48:28.720 --> 48:31.320
 your lungs are filled with tons of little sacks,

48:31.320 --> 48:34.600
 when they tend to collapse as you fatigue

48:34.600 --> 48:36.480
 and carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream.

48:36.480 --> 48:37.780
 And that's when we start getting stressed.

48:37.780 --> 48:39.800
 If you've ever been sprinting and you start getting beat

48:39.800 --> 48:41.500
 and you're going as hard as you can,

48:41.500 --> 48:43.240
 what you really need to do is double inhale

48:43.240 --> 48:45.080
 and reinflate these sacks in the lungs

48:45.080 --> 48:47.160
 and then offload a lot of carbon dioxide.

48:47.160 --> 48:49.740
 So when you're at a steady cadence and you're feeling good,

48:49.740 --> 48:52.840
 double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale

48:52.840 --> 48:54.920
 is a terrific way to breathe

48:54.920 --> 48:56.920
 while you're in ongoing effort.

48:56.920 --> 49:00.120
 By the way, any recommendations or differences

49:00.120 --> 49:03.000
 in nose or mouth breathing?

49:03.000 --> 49:05.880
 So nasal breathing, there's a lot of excitement now,

49:05.880 --> 49:07.080
 obviously about nasal breathing

49:07.080 --> 49:09.360
 because of James Nestor's book, Breath.

49:09.360 --> 49:12.160
 There was also, if people are going to know about that book,

49:12.160 --> 49:15.680
 I do feel like out of respect for my colleagues,

49:15.680 --> 49:19.240
 there was a book by Sandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich

49:19.240 --> 49:20.900
 at Stanford, both professors at Stanford

49:20.900 --> 49:24.440
 with a forward by Jared Diamond and Robert Sapolsky.

49:24.440 --> 49:26.240
 So some heavy hitters in this book.

49:26.240 --> 49:28.880
 And the book is called Jaws, A Hidden Epidemic.

49:28.880 --> 49:32.640
 And it's all about how nasal breathing is better for us,

49:32.640 --> 49:35.160
 especially kids, than being mouth breathers

49:35.160 --> 49:38.320
 under most conditions for sake of improving immunity.

49:38.320 --> 49:40.280
 It turns out there's a microbiome in the nose,

49:40.280 --> 49:41.520
 like all sorts of good stuff

49:41.520 --> 49:43.840
 about nasal breathing preferentially.

49:43.840 --> 49:48.640
 But when we exercise, you can do pure nasal breathing.

49:48.640 --> 49:50.960
 But the problem is once you get up to kind of third

49:50.960 --> 49:52.760
 and fourth and fifth gear effort,

49:52.760 --> 49:55.440
 you can't nasal breathe and be at maximum capacity

49:55.440 --> 49:57.480
 unless you've been training it for a very long time.

49:57.480 --> 49:59.440
 So I would say double inhale through the nose,

49:59.440 --> 50:00.680
 offload through the mouth.

50:00.680 --> 50:03.800
 So double inhale, exhale while you're in steady effort.

50:03.800 --> 50:05.960
 And then if you really feel like you need to gas it

50:05.960 --> 50:08.480
 and you're pushing, the data show that then

50:08.480 --> 50:10.840
 just use whatever's there, right?

50:10.840 --> 50:12.580
 Just go into kind of default mode

50:12.580 --> 50:15.760
 because bringing too much concentration to something

50:15.760 --> 50:17.920
 is also going to spend epinephrine.

50:17.920 --> 50:20.420
 The goal is to get into that, I don't like the word,

50:20.420 --> 50:22.960
 but the flow state where you're not thinking too much,

50:22.960 --> 50:24.920
 you're just in exertion.

50:24.920 --> 50:28.200
 So these are things that can help in the transitions,

50:28.200 --> 50:31.600
 but I don't think there's any secret breathing technique.

50:31.600 --> 50:33.800
 Anyone who's been in the SEAL teams will kind of,

50:33.800 --> 50:37.120
 they'll tell you like, there's no breathing technique, right?

50:37.120 --> 50:41.400
 There's tools that you can look to from time to time.

50:41.400 --> 50:43.160
 And these double inhale exhales can be great

50:43.160 --> 50:45.740
 for setting heart rate variability very quickly

50:45.740 --> 50:48.280
 and getting into a steady cadence while you're exercising.

50:48.280 --> 50:49.320
 But if there's a sprint,

50:49.320 --> 50:50.980
 like if suddenly you guys are sprinting,

50:50.980 --> 50:54.880
 ditch the double inhale, exhale, and just sprint.

50:54.880 --> 50:56.220
 One thing that you mentioned,

50:56.220 --> 50:58.540
 he's probably gonna push my buttons.

50:58.540 --> 51:01.200
 It's a good place to ask a question about anger.

51:01.200 --> 51:04.520
 So I'll probably get pissed off at him at some point.

51:04.520 --> 51:05.820
 I'm guessing.

51:05.820 --> 51:10.820
 And do you have thoughts from a scientific perspective

51:12.000 --> 51:14.600
 or also just the personal philosophical perspective

51:14.600 --> 51:16.560
 about the role of anger in all of this

51:16.560 --> 51:20.720
 and in managing alertness, performance?

51:20.720 --> 51:21.880
 I think about this a lot

51:21.880 --> 51:23.800
 because there's so much out there

51:23.800 --> 51:25.580
 about how important it is to do things

51:25.580 --> 51:28.680
 from a place of love, you know.

51:28.680 --> 51:30.000
 I tweet about it all the time.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.960
 And I think, and love is powerful, right?

51:32.960 --> 51:35.860
 It is interesting that autonomic arousal alertness,

51:35.860 --> 51:37.240
 let's just use simple language,

51:37.240 --> 51:41.160
 alertness physiologically looks identical

51:41.160 --> 51:45.720
 for love and excitement as it does for anger

51:45.720 --> 51:48.800
 and frustration and wanting to defeat your opponent

51:49.840 --> 51:52.380
 or whoever that opponent happens to be.

51:52.380 --> 51:54.960
 They're identical except that the love component

51:54.960 --> 51:57.600
 does tend to be associated with the release

51:57.600 --> 52:01.020
 of neurochemicals of the serotonin and dopamine type

52:01.020 --> 52:03.920
 that do have this replenishment component.

52:03.920 --> 52:06.400
 I don't think one wants to be in constant anger

52:06.400 --> 52:10.380
 and friction, but I mean, I'll come clean a bit.

52:10.380 --> 52:11.600
 There've been portions of my career

52:11.600 --> 52:14.160
 where some of my best work, my extra two hours,

52:14.160 --> 52:17.720
 my ability to nail a really hard deadline or problem

52:17.720 --> 52:21.320
 has come from not wanting to get out competed

52:21.320 --> 52:24.720
 or from wanting to prove something.

52:24.720 --> 52:29.280
 These days, I'm not oriented from that place

52:29.280 --> 52:30.920
 toward my work quite as often,

52:30.920 --> 52:33.000
 but I think we should be really honest.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.320
 Anger is powerful provided it's channeled.

52:36.320 --> 52:40.360
 It's very, very powerful and it can give you a ton of fuel

52:40.360 --> 52:44.680
 and gas to push when otherwise you tap.

52:44.680 --> 52:49.440
 Yeah, Joe Rogan has, aside from being a fan of his,

52:49.440 --> 52:52.480
 has been an inspiration to sort of be,

52:52.480 --> 52:55.720
 to have a kind of loving view on the world

52:55.720 --> 52:58.200
 and the way you approach the world to me.

52:58.200 --> 53:01.780
 So I've tended to want to approach the world that way,

53:01.780 --> 53:06.160
 but in the same way, David Goggins has been an inspiration

53:06.160 --> 53:11.160
 to like, yeah, be angry at stuff and use it as fuel.

53:13.280 --> 53:17.680
 Like he almost conjures up artificial demons in his mind

53:17.680 --> 53:19.620
 just so he can fight them.

53:19.620 --> 53:22.480
 You know, but at the same time I tried that

53:22.480 --> 53:25.000
 because I did a challenge in the summer

53:25.000 --> 53:27.900
 of where for 30 days I was doing a lot of pushups

53:27.900 --> 53:32.900
 and it was, over time, it was counterproductive for me.

53:33.960 --> 53:37.360
 Like I found that it was easier to just,

53:38.800 --> 53:42.120
 like the rollercoaster that the emotional,

53:42.120 --> 53:46.240
 like being angry at stuff takes you can also be exhausting.

53:46.240 --> 53:48.720
 Oh, absolutely, and it can take you down,

53:48.720 --> 53:53.120
 like the ups of it are good, but the downs are bad.

53:53.120 --> 53:56.040
 And what I found is better to get,

53:56.040 --> 53:57.800
 to use it as a boost every once in a while,

53:57.800 --> 54:00.620
 but mostly to get lost in the,

54:00.620 --> 54:01.880
 you're talking about the breath work,

54:01.880 --> 54:05.360
 the like getting lost in the ritual of it,

54:05.360 --> 54:07.200
 like the beat like that,

54:07.200 --> 54:10.880
 as opposed to going on the big rollercoasters of emotion.

54:10.880 --> 54:14.720
 Yet this brings us into the realm of neuroendocrinology.

54:14.720 --> 54:16.360
 There's a fascinating relationship between

54:16.360 --> 54:18.260
 the hormone system and the nervous system.

54:18.260 --> 54:22.080
 And, you know, hormones work in general on slower timescales.

54:22.080 --> 54:24.240
 The definition of a hormone is a chemical released

54:24.240 --> 54:25.480
 at one location in the body,

54:25.480 --> 54:28.260
 goes and acts at multiple locations far away

54:28.260 --> 54:29.100
 within the body.

54:29.100 --> 54:30.860
 Pheromone would be between two bodies.

54:31.880 --> 54:33.880
 Neurochemicals like dopamine and serotonin

54:33.880 --> 54:35.000
 tend to work a little more quickly.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.360
 There are hormones like adrenaline and cortisol

54:37.360 --> 54:38.440
 that can work very fast,

54:38.440 --> 54:43.440
 but here I'm referring mainly to testosterone, prolactin.

54:43.440 --> 54:45.200
 Prolactin tends to be in men,

54:45.200 --> 54:47.340
 and women tends to make people kind of lazy

54:47.340 --> 54:49.740
 and want to take care of young.

54:49.740 --> 54:52.640
 It tends to throw down body fat so we can stay up late.

54:52.640 --> 54:54.940
 It's secreted in response to having children.

54:54.940 --> 54:58.240
 These are all in humans and in animals.

54:58.240 --> 54:59.840
 There's a very interesting relationship

54:59.840 --> 55:02.780
 between testosterone and dopamine

55:04.000 --> 55:07.600
 that speaks directly to what we're talking about now.

55:07.600 --> 55:11.840
 So dopamine and testosterone are closely related

55:11.840 --> 55:14.320
 in the pituitary system.

55:14.320 --> 55:16.800
 And obviously testosterone comes from the adrenals

55:16.800 --> 55:18.440
 and from the testes.

55:18.440 --> 55:21.920
 But the major effect of testosterone

55:21.920 --> 55:24.840
 is to make effort feel good.

55:24.840 --> 55:26.240
 That's what testosterone does.

55:26.240 --> 55:27.800
 It has other effects too, right?

55:27.800 --> 55:28.720
 Reproductive effects,

55:28.720 --> 55:31.520
 androgenizing parts of the body, et cetera.

55:31.520 --> 55:34.560
 But it makes effort feel good.

55:34.560 --> 55:38.200
 The testosterone molecule is synthesized from cholesterol.

55:38.200 --> 55:41.200
 Cholesterol can either be made into cortisol,

55:41.200 --> 55:43.880
 a stress hormone, or testosterone, but not both.

55:43.880 --> 55:46.600
 So you have a limited amount of cholesterol

55:46.600 --> 55:49.000
 and it gets diverted towards stress

55:49.000 --> 55:52.040
 or this pathway where effort feels good.

55:53.460 --> 55:55.280
 That's the pathway you want to get into.

55:55.280 --> 55:56.340
 The anger pathway,

55:56.340 --> 56:00.240
 if we were to just kind of play a mind experiment here,

56:00.240 --> 56:02.640
 the anger eventually is going to divert

56:02.640 --> 56:06.320
 more of that cholesterol molecule to cortisol and stress,

56:06.320 --> 56:08.720
 and you will be slowly depleting testosterone.

56:08.720 --> 56:10.600
 Now going into this,

56:10.600 --> 56:11.840
 you'll have plenty of testosterone,

56:11.840 --> 56:13.320
 but after a couple of days,

56:13.320 --> 56:15.240
 there've been very interesting studies showing

56:15.240 --> 56:17.680
 that testosterone doesn't necessarily drop

56:17.680 --> 56:19.160
 with sleep deprivation.

56:19.160 --> 56:20.320
 That's a bit of a myth.

56:20.320 --> 56:22.000
 You need it to replenish testosterone.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.480
 You need sleep to replenish testosterone eventually.

56:24.480 --> 56:25.840
 But the real question is,

56:25.840 --> 56:27.920
 are you enjoying what you're doing?

56:27.920 --> 56:29.960
 And here the work was,

56:29.960 --> 56:33.320
 some of the major work on this was done by Duncan French,

56:33.320 --> 56:34.880
 who runs the UFC Training Center.

56:34.880 --> 56:37.660
 He did his PhD at UConn stores,

56:37.660 --> 56:40.040
 did a really beautiful PhD thesis

56:40.040 --> 56:42.080
 looking at the relationship between stress hormones,

56:42.080 --> 56:44.560
 testosterone, and dopamine.

56:44.560 --> 56:45.920
 Really interesting work.

56:45.920 --> 56:49.240
 And the takeaway from all of this is,

56:49.240 --> 56:51.280
 if you can just convince yourself,

56:51.280 --> 56:54.400
 or ideally if you can just enjoy yourself,

56:54.400 --> 56:55.820
 you are going to maintain

56:55.820 --> 56:58.400
 or maybe even increase testosterone stores,

56:58.400 --> 57:00.560
 which will make effort feel good.

57:00.560 --> 57:03.360
 And to me, aside from neuroplasticity

57:03.360 --> 57:06.480
 where everything becomes automatic after this experience,

57:06.480 --> 57:08.880
 to me, that's the holy grail.

57:08.880 --> 57:12.720
 When effort feels good, life just gets way better.

57:12.720 --> 57:14.840
 And we're not talking about achieving the reward.

57:14.840 --> 57:16.480
 I'm not talking about the end of this thing.

57:16.480 --> 57:19.600
 I'm talking about the process of it feeling really good.

57:19.600 --> 57:21.680
 Yeah, there is a magic to,

57:23.320 --> 57:24.720
 I don't know if you can comment on this,

57:24.720 --> 57:28.080
 but I find myself being able to,

57:28.080 --> 57:30.120
 if I just say I'm feeling good,

57:30.120 --> 57:34.900
 like this old hack of like smiling while you're running,

57:34.900 --> 57:38.560
 if I just tell myself, I'm feeling really good right now,

57:38.560 --> 57:40.760
 no matter how I'm actually feeling,

57:40.760 --> 57:42.080
 I'll start feeling way better.

57:42.080 --> 57:45.160
 And the whole thing, there's a cascading effect

57:45.160 --> 57:48.840
 that allows me to maximize the effort.

57:48.840 --> 57:50.420
 It's quite fascinating.

57:50.420 --> 57:51.540
 It's weird.

57:51.540 --> 57:52.860
 Hormones are powerful.

57:52.860 --> 57:54.840
 The relationship between thoughts and hormones

57:54.840 --> 57:57.080
 and these physiological things is enormous.

57:57.080 --> 57:58.880
 I had a colleague that a few years ago,

57:58.880 --> 58:01.520
 he was dying of pancreatic cancer.

58:01.520 --> 58:03.040
 And I was interviewing him

58:03.040 --> 58:05.680
 just because he's an important figure in our community.

58:05.680 --> 58:07.040
 And I was a friend.

58:07.040 --> 58:09.400
 And there was one day where he told me,

58:09.400 --> 58:12.800
 he said, I don't want to make it past the new year.

58:12.800 --> 58:15.080
 And it was crushing for me to hear.

58:15.080 --> 58:18.440
 And I knew that he had been on some androgen therapy

58:18.440 --> 58:20.160
 for a whole set of other things.

58:20.160 --> 58:24.700
 And I said, have you taken your androgen cream?

58:24.700 --> 58:25.860
 And he was like, no, I haven't done it.

58:25.860 --> 58:27.300
 Go get it for me.

58:27.300 --> 58:28.240
 I have this on film.

58:28.240 --> 58:30.120
 He takes it, he puts the androgen cream on.

58:30.120 --> 58:33.160
 I'm not suggesting people take androgens, by the way.

58:33.160 --> 58:35.760
 10 minutes later, he says, you know what?

58:35.760 --> 58:37.560
 I think I want to live into the new year.

58:37.560 --> 58:39.880
 And I'm going to write 12 letters of recommendation.

58:39.880 --> 58:41.200
 He went to MIT, by the way.

58:41.200 --> 58:43.880
 He said, I'm going to write 12 letters of recommendation.

58:43.880 --> 58:44.720
 And he did.

58:44.720 --> 58:47.160
 And so there's something about these molecules

58:47.160 --> 58:50.480
 that in an ancient way, in all organisms,

58:50.480 --> 58:52.720
 all mammals, as far as we know,

58:52.720 --> 58:54.760
 are linked to the will to live.

58:54.760 --> 58:57.520
 They're linked to effort and making effort feel good,

58:57.520 --> 59:00.400
 which has been fundamental to the evolution of our species.

59:00.400 --> 59:02.560
 I always say, people think that the opposite

59:02.560 --> 59:05.000
 of testosterone is estrogen, but it's not.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.400
 The opposite of testosterone is prolactin,

59:07.400 --> 59:09.040
 which makes us feel quiescent

59:09.040 --> 59:11.240
 and not in pursuit of things, et cetera.

59:12.280 --> 59:14.660
 Testosterone makes effort feel good.

59:14.660 --> 59:17.000
 Estrogen makes emotions feel okay.

59:19.160 --> 59:24.000
 And they are in mixed amounts in people,

59:24.000 --> 59:26.360
 as I say, have all chromosomal backgrounds.

59:26.360 --> 59:27.200
 Yeah.

59:27.200 --> 59:29.560
 I mean, you also mentioned fasting potentially

59:29.560 --> 59:31.560
 through this two day thing.

59:31.560 --> 59:35.080
 It'd be cool to get your thoughts about fasting in general.

59:35.080 --> 59:38.320
 Do you think on a personal level

59:38.320 --> 59:41.160
 and at a higher sort of level of studies

59:41.160 --> 59:44.580
 that you're aware of and physiology and so on,

59:44.580 --> 59:46.460
 what do you think about intermittent fasting

59:46.460 --> 59:48.800
 of like not eating for 16 hours

59:48.800 --> 59:51.620
 and then having an eight hour window

59:51.620 --> 59:53.560
 or something I've been doing a lot recently,

59:53.560 --> 59:56.480
 which is eating only once a day.

59:56.480 --> 1:00:00.640
 So that's 24 hour fast, I guess, one meal a day

1:00:00.640 --> 1:00:05.040
 or something I've been thinking about doing,

1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:07.660
 haven't done yet of doing like 72 hours

1:00:07.660 --> 1:00:11.440
 or some people do like five day fasts in general.

1:00:11.440 --> 1:00:13.600
 So this will be for this particular run

1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:17.640
 will be a 48 hour fast if I don't eat at all.

1:00:17.640 --> 1:00:19.780
 What do you think about that for performance,

1:00:19.780 --> 1:00:21.960
 for mood, for all those kinds of things?

1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:23.720
 I can speak a little bit to the science

1:00:23.720 --> 1:00:25.320
 and a little bit of my own experience

1:00:25.320 --> 1:00:28.320
 and then some anecdotes of people that have done very hard,

1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:30.280
 very long duration things and what they've told me.

1:00:30.280 --> 1:00:32.220
 So I just want to make sure I'm separating those out

1:00:32.220 --> 1:00:34.120
 so people know my sourcing.

1:00:34.120 --> 1:00:37.280
 I think now none of this is about the actual

1:00:37.280 --> 1:00:40.560
 longterm nutritional benefits of one thing or the other.

1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:43.340
 But if you look at the science on intermittent fasting,

1:00:43.340 --> 1:00:45.120
 it's pretty remarkable.

1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:47.080
 Before I was at Stanford, my lab was in San Diego.

1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:50.300
 One of my colleagues was such in Panda at the Salk

1:00:50.300 --> 1:00:53.360
 is phenomenal biologist and researcher,

1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:54.960
 wrote a book called the circadian code.

1:00:54.960 --> 1:00:57.600
 It's very, very good and kind of popularized

1:00:57.600 --> 1:00:59.440
 intermittent fasting, although there were others

1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:01.840
 that had talked about this before.

1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:04.240
 Ori Hofmechler talked about the warrior diet.

1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:06.840
 People probably might not know who Ori is,

1:01:06.840 --> 1:01:08.720
 but he's sort of the originator

1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:11.040
 of this business of intermittent fasting

1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:12.540
 eating once a day or limited.

1:01:12.540 --> 1:01:15.240
 Anyway, Sachin has published papers,

1:01:15.240 --> 1:01:17.520
 peer reviewed papers in very good journals

1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:18.920
 like Cell and elsewhere,

1:01:18.920 --> 1:01:22.200
 showing that limiting the consumption of calories

1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:26.800
 to eight, four, six, or eight, or even 10 hours

1:01:26.800 --> 1:01:28.720
 of every 24 hour cycle

1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:32.920
 and keeping that more or less correlated with the light

1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:37.640
 with when the sun is out leads to less liver disease,

1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:41.720
 improved metabolic markers, less body fat, et cetera.

1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:43.800
 In the mouse studies, they even gave the mice the choice

1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:45.760
 to eat whatever they wanted, as much as they want,

1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:48.160
 as long as they restrict it to a certain period

1:01:48.160 --> 1:01:51.480
 within the 24 hour cycle, they did great.

1:01:51.480 --> 1:01:53.740
 They maintained a healthy weight or even lost weight.

1:01:53.740 --> 1:01:55.360
 When they took the same amount of food

1:01:55.360 --> 1:01:58.320
 and they stretched it out across the entire 24 hour cycle.

1:01:58.320 --> 1:02:00.320
 So this is eating every hour or two hours,

1:02:00.320 --> 1:02:02.320
 the animals got fat and sick.

1:02:02.320 --> 1:02:04.560
 So it's pretty remarkable data.

1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:06.560
 How much of that translates to humans isn't clear,

1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:10.240
 but one thing that's really clear with humans is adherence.

1:02:10.240 --> 1:02:11.880
 We could talk a lot about nutrition

1:02:11.880 --> 1:02:14.200
 and some of the problems with the studies on nutrition

1:02:14.200 --> 1:02:16.160
 is that what people will do in a laboratory

1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:18.600
 is often hard to do in the real world.

1:02:18.600 --> 1:02:21.400
 Low carbohydrate diets just they tend,

1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:23.400
 because they tend to focus on foods

1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:27.000
 that have high amino acid content like meats.

1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.800
 Generally people are less hungry on those

1:02:29.800 --> 1:02:32.560
 than they are on calorie matched diets

1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:34.720
 of fruits and vegetables and carbohydrates,

1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:36.820
 because when the insulin goes up,

1:02:36.820 --> 1:02:38.520
 you get hungry and you want to eat more.

1:02:38.520 --> 1:02:40.720
 So this is not a push for carnivore

1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:42.560
 or a push against one thing or the other.

1:02:42.560 --> 1:02:45.140
 It's just, there are a lot of factors,

1:02:45.140 --> 1:02:49.480
 but we know for sure that when you're fasted

1:02:49.480 --> 1:02:52.260
 or when you have low amounts of carbohydrate in your system,

1:02:52.260 --> 1:02:55.440
 complex carbohydrate, your alertness is going to go up.

1:02:55.440 --> 1:03:00.000
 Fasting increases alertness and epinephrine

1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:01.880
 for the sole purpose of getting you to go out

1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:02.800
 and find food.

1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:04.980
 Can you imagine if our ancestors got hungry

1:03:04.980 --> 1:03:07.240
 and they were like, oh, I'm too tired to go find food.

1:03:07.240 --> 1:03:08.240
 We wouldn't be here.

1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:09.520
 It'd be like robots or something.

1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:13.920
 One of your alien buddies will be like running the planet.

1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:16.720
 So I think that if you want to be alert,

1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:20.400
 fasting or keeping complex carbohydrates to a minimum

1:03:20.400 --> 1:03:22.120
 is very valuable.

1:03:22.120 --> 1:03:24.560
 If you want to sleep and you want to be sleepy,

1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:27.400
 ingesting foods that have a lot of tryptophan,

1:03:27.400 --> 1:03:28.920
 which is the precursor to serotonin,

1:03:28.920 --> 1:03:31.320
 so complex carbohydrates like rice and grains,

1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:32.660
 turkey, white meats,

1:03:32.660 --> 1:03:34.700
 those things do create a sense of sleepiness.

1:03:34.700 --> 1:03:36.200
 However, there is a caveat,

1:03:36.200 --> 1:03:40.400
 and this is one problem with the once a day meal,

1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:43.180
 is that anytime you have a lot of food in the gut,

1:03:43.180 --> 1:03:44.640
 you're increasing sleepiness

1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:46.680
 because you're diverting blood to the gut.

1:03:46.680 --> 1:03:49.720
 It's going to trigger the vagus to signal to the brain

1:03:49.720 --> 1:03:53.560
 to shut down your system and utilize those nutrients,

1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:55.280
 digest and utilize those nutrients.

1:03:55.280 --> 1:03:58.160
 So I've done the once a day eating thing.

1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:00.400
 The problem is I eat so much in that meal

1:04:00.400 --> 1:04:02.200
 that I'm exhausted.

1:04:02.200 --> 1:04:05.740
 And so it doesn't always lend itself well to the schedule.

1:04:05.740 --> 1:04:08.280
 But so in a six or eight hour eating block for me

1:04:08.280 --> 1:04:10.080
 is a little bit better.

1:04:10.080 --> 1:04:11.220
 I do eat carbohydrates.

1:04:11.220 --> 1:04:13.160
 I'm probably one of the few people left on the West coast

1:04:13.160 --> 1:04:14.720
 that actually consumes carbohydrates

1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:15.560
 and we'll say that out loud.

1:04:15.560 --> 1:04:17.840
 I don't know people eat carbs anymore, that's weird.

1:04:17.840 --> 1:04:18.680
 They don't.

1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:20.040
 Where do you even find carbs these days?

1:04:20.040 --> 1:04:20.860
 I like oatmeal.

1:04:20.860 --> 1:04:21.700
 I like rice.

1:04:21.700 --> 1:04:24.400
 The other time is if people are doing very high intensity

1:04:24.400 --> 1:04:26.480
 weight train, they need to replenish glycogen.

1:04:26.480 --> 1:04:27.760
 On the alertness side,

1:04:27.760 --> 1:04:30.200
 I do feel like it's probably person dependent.

1:04:30.200 --> 1:04:34.920
 For me alertness, being alert makes my life better

1:04:34.920 --> 1:04:38.840
 in a lot of ways, more than just the alertness itself.

1:04:38.840 --> 1:04:41.520
 Like for example, one of the things I discovered

1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:45.880
 with fasting is that when I was training twice a day

1:04:45.880 --> 1:04:48.840
 in jujitsu, for example, and competing and so on,

1:04:48.840 --> 1:04:52.320
 I performed way better at things that you traditionally

1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:53.920
 would say you need carbs for,

1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:56.000
 which is explosive movements and all that.

1:04:56.860 --> 1:05:00.160
 I don't know if I actually perform better

1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:05.160
 in terms of like the force of the explosion,

1:05:05.560 --> 1:05:06.860
 the explosiveness.

1:05:06.860 --> 1:05:09.680
 What I do know is the alertness resulted

1:05:09.680 --> 1:05:13.500
 in me doing the technique more precisely.

1:05:13.500 --> 1:05:16.360
 That's the dopamine and epinephrine system in action.

1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:21.360
 And there are some other just purely physical aspects

1:05:23.080 --> 1:05:25.920
 to one diet versus the other that can be complicated.

1:05:25.920 --> 1:05:28.640
 If you're ingesting carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates,

1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:31.080
 you're going to replenish glycogen, which is great,

1:05:31.080 --> 1:05:33.480
 but they also tend to be bulky and fibrous.

1:05:33.480 --> 1:05:35.320
 And I've never rolled jujitsu,

1:05:35.320 --> 1:05:37.840
 but running when you have a lot of bulky fibrous food

1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:41.160
 in your gut or in your intestine, it can be a barrier.

1:05:41.160 --> 1:05:42.560
 It can be uncomfortable.

1:05:42.560 --> 1:05:45.260
 And so some people do really well on low carbohydrate,

1:05:45.260 --> 1:05:48.400
 meat rich diets, because they're just not as bloated.

1:05:48.400 --> 1:05:51.480
 They're not carrying as much water and other stuff.

1:05:51.480 --> 1:05:54.200
 Carbohydrate carries a lot of water molecules with it.

1:05:54.200 --> 1:05:56.040
 So there are aspects to being able to train

1:05:56.040 --> 1:05:58.200
 and being really explosive because you feel light.

1:05:58.200 --> 1:06:00.160
 One anecdote that really, again,

1:06:00.160 --> 1:06:02.560
 I'm not encouraging any one particular kind of diet,

1:06:02.560 --> 1:06:07.140
 but I have a friend who was in the SEAL teams.

1:06:07.140 --> 1:06:08.760
 I happen to know a number of people in that community.

1:06:08.760 --> 1:06:11.420
 And he told me that he did this very long fast.

1:06:11.420 --> 1:06:14.060
 It was a fast that I think you get to eat a little bit

1:06:14.060 --> 1:06:15.480
 of soup or broth.

1:06:15.480 --> 1:06:16.920
 And there's like a bar or something,

1:06:16.920 --> 1:06:18.720
 but it's like a nine day thing.

1:06:18.720 --> 1:06:21.280
 And he's a very strong athlete.

1:06:21.280 --> 1:06:24.680
 And he said that on day six or seven,

1:06:24.680 --> 1:06:27.300
 he was running up some hills or something

1:06:27.300 --> 1:06:28.560
 while he was on deployment.

1:06:28.560 --> 1:06:31.480
 And he felt amazing.

1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:33.080
 He had kind of hit this other level.

1:06:33.080 --> 1:06:35.280
 He was somebody who had boxed in the Naval Academy.

1:06:35.280 --> 1:06:40.280
 He was somebody who knows and knew high output.

1:06:40.360 --> 1:06:43.720
 And he felt like he discovered the 13th floor,

1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:46.660
 that there was another floor to this performance space

1:06:46.660 --> 1:06:50.560
 that he hadn't experienced except while he had fasted.

1:06:50.560 --> 1:06:53.660
 And he said that that was a remarkable clarity of mind,

1:06:53.660 --> 1:06:55.440
 energy, it's a little bit of what you described.

1:06:55.440 --> 1:06:58.160
 He described a kind of suppleness and explosiveness.

1:06:58.160 --> 1:06:59.400
 So there's probably something there.

1:06:59.400 --> 1:07:01.000
 On which day?

1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:04.000
 At once he was in the fifth or sixth day of the fast.

1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:06.360
 See, this is the thing is I've never been there

1:07:06.360 --> 1:07:09.920
 on the second, third, fourth, fifth day, that kind of thing.

1:07:09.920 --> 1:07:13.840
 But when I just don't eat for 20 hours,

1:07:14.920 --> 1:07:18.840
 many times through my training, the clarity,

1:07:18.840 --> 1:07:23.160
 it's like you feel like everyone is moving super slowly

1:07:23.160 --> 1:07:25.520
 and you're able to like dominate people

1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:26.920
 you weren't able to before.

1:07:26.920 --> 1:07:27.760
 It's like.

1:07:27.760 --> 1:07:29.600
 Well, you might've slipped into,

1:07:29.600 --> 1:07:32.520
 or switched over rather into full ketosis.

1:07:32.520 --> 1:07:36.400
 And ketogenic diets done properly can be great for people.

1:07:36.400 --> 1:07:38.480
 The problem is if you do it wrong, you can really mess it up.

1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:40.880
 I tried it once and I basically got psoriasis.

1:07:40.880 --> 1:07:42.400
 I thought my scalp was going to fall off.

1:07:42.400 --> 1:07:44.320
 I was like sloughing off all this.

1:07:44.320 --> 1:07:47.160
 And then I stopped and I was taking the liquid ketones.

1:07:47.160 --> 1:07:49.000
 And then all of a sudden I felt better again.

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.080
 But I was told that I just did it wrong.

1:07:52.080 --> 1:07:53.200
 Yes.

1:07:53.200 --> 1:07:54.040
 That's right.

1:07:54.040 --> 1:07:55.320
 So I think there's a right way and a wrong way

1:07:55.320 --> 1:07:56.760
 and you have to get it right.

1:07:56.760 --> 1:07:57.600
 Definitely.

1:07:57.600 --> 1:07:59.640
 And so I've experimented quite a bit with keto

1:07:59.640 --> 1:08:02.480
 to see how my body feels and doing it the right way

1:08:02.480 --> 1:08:03.800
 and following all the instructions.

1:08:03.800 --> 1:08:07.560
 There's definitely a huge difference that,

1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:09.360
 like for example, one of the things I discovered,

1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:11.160
 everyone knows who said this,

1:08:11.160 --> 1:08:15.360
 but I tried this recently over the past year

1:08:15.360 --> 1:08:18.760
 is I started drinking when I don't feel great.

1:08:18.760 --> 1:08:22.960
 If I'm fasting, a bone broth, a chicken bone broth.

1:08:22.960 --> 1:08:25.640
 And for some reason, like magically it could be,

1:08:25.640 --> 1:08:28.440
 this is the other thing, the mind, I don't know,

1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:30.920
 but it makes me feel really good.

1:08:30.920 --> 1:08:32.840
 Well, it could be the salt.

1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:35.560
 So I mean, neurons, the action potential neurons,

1:08:35.560 --> 1:08:37.360
 as you know, is sodium is rushing into the cell.

1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:39.760
 You need enough extracellular sodium

1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:42.280
 in order for your brain and nervous system to function.

1:08:42.280 --> 1:08:45.760
 And so salt, I mean, unless people have hypertension,

1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:46.600
 salt is great.

1:08:46.600 --> 1:08:49.080
 There was an article in Science Magazine about a decade ago

1:08:49.080 --> 1:08:50.880
 about how salt had been demonized

1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:52.400
 and unless people have hypertension,

1:08:52.400 --> 1:08:54.600
 provide you drink enough water, salt is great.

1:08:54.600 --> 1:08:57.800
 You need sodium, magnesium, and potassium to function

1:08:57.800 --> 1:08:59.280
 and for your nerve cells to work.

1:08:59.280 --> 1:09:00.960
 I mean, people who overdrink water

1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:03.880
 and don't consume enough electrolyte die.

1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:05.640
 Now, hydration is really important.

1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:07.280
 I know David's really into hydration.

1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:08.480
 He's mentioned that a few times.

1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:11.400
 I mean, hydrating properly is key.

1:09:11.400 --> 1:09:12.920
 And so you definitely want to make sure

1:09:12.920 --> 1:09:14.280
 that you're drinking enough water

1:09:14.280 --> 1:09:16.320
 and getting enough electrolytes.

1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:18.200
 We should have actually talked about that at the beginning

1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:19.240
 because that's going to keep

1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:21.440
 your nervous system functioning well.

1:09:21.440 --> 1:09:24.880
 And a lot of people, they'll get shaky or jittery

1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:27.920
 when they're fasting and they'll think they need sugar.

1:09:27.920 --> 1:09:30.000
 And if they just put some salt in some water,

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:30.960
 they feel fine.

1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:33.240
 And like the other stuff, potassium, magnesium,

1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:34.720
 whatever the other electrolytes are.

1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:36.520
 But yeah, those three.

1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:38.040
 I mean, salt, yeah.

1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:40.680
 Magnesium is good before sleep.

1:09:40.680 --> 1:09:42.080
 Salt.

1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:43.400
 I mean, this is a vast space.

1:09:43.400 --> 1:09:44.720
 And we're kind of talking about the overlap

1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:48.160
 between neurochemicals, hormones, and nutrition.

1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:49.760
 And it's a fascinating space.

1:09:49.760 --> 1:09:53.560
 And it's one that the academic community has gems

1:09:53.560 --> 1:09:54.640
 within the textbooks.

1:09:54.640 --> 1:09:57.680
 It hasn't really made it into the public sphere yet.

1:09:57.680 --> 1:09:59.760
 And I think that's because people get so caught up

1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:03.520
 in the being, are you vegan or are you carnivore?

1:10:03.520 --> 1:10:05.920
 And there's a vast space in between too

1:10:05.920 --> 1:10:06.800
 that people can explore.

1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:08.240
 Like I'm not a competitive athlete.

1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:12.840
 So I eat meat and I also eat vegetables and I eat fruits

1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:14.360
 and it's just about timing them.

1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:16.280
 But I tend to eat carbohydrates when I want to be sleepy.

1:10:16.280 --> 1:10:17.120
 I eat them at night.

1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:18.760
 And everyone said, that's the worst thing.

1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:19.760
 You can't do that.

1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:21.800
 You sleep great after eating a big bowl of pasta.

1:10:21.800 --> 1:10:22.720
 I'll tell you.

1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:25.680
 And by the way, I should give you a big thank you

1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:28.360
 for connecting me with Bell Campo Farms.

1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:31.960
 They sent me some meat, I think because of you.

1:10:33.200 --> 1:10:34.400
 And it's delicious.

1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:37.200
 So I really appreciate that.

1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:40.160
 I mean, it also connected me with this whole world

1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:43.840
 of people who are doing farming in this ethical way

1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:46.080
 and like really love the whole process.

1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:49.560
 And from both like a human level,

1:10:49.560 --> 1:10:51.400
 but also scientific level.

1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:56.240
 And the result is, it's like ethical,

1:10:56.240 --> 1:10:57.760
 but also it's delicious.

1:10:57.760 --> 1:11:00.360
 And it makes you think about your diet

1:11:00.360 --> 1:11:01.840
 in a whole new kind of way.

1:11:01.840 --> 1:11:04.520
 Yeah, I don't have any commercial relationship

1:11:04.520 --> 1:11:06.000
 to Bell Campo, so I can be very clear.

1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:07.440
 I've known Anya Fernald,

1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:10.800
 who is the founder and CEO of Bell Campo.

1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:12.600
 I've known her since the ninth grade.

1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:15.200
 It is true that her parents are faculty members at Stanford,

1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:16.320
 they're colleagues of mine,

1:11:16.320 --> 1:11:18.760
 but she's just a serious academic of nutrition,

1:11:18.760 --> 1:11:21.320
 but also of sustainable agriculture,

1:11:21.320 --> 1:11:22.720
 of all sorts of things.

1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:24.360
 And also the meat just, it's awesome.

1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:25.200
 It tastes really good.

1:11:25.200 --> 1:11:26.840
 And no, I'm not getting paid to say that.

1:11:26.840 --> 1:11:29.040
 And no, they're not a sponsoring my podcast.

1:11:29.040 --> 1:11:32.200
 It's just, I feel like if you're gonna eat animals,

1:11:32.200 --> 1:11:35.120
 if that's in your framework and you're gonna eat animals,

1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:39.360
 knowing that the animals were raised as happy as could be

1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:43.640
 until time of slaughter is at least important to me.

1:11:43.640 --> 1:11:45.240
 And actually talked to her,

1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:47.640
 so I will talk to her on this podcast actually.

1:11:47.640 --> 1:11:52.200
 And she invited me like a week ago out to visit the farm

1:11:52.200 --> 1:11:53.400
 in May or June or whatever.

1:11:53.400 --> 1:11:54.920
 Yeah, they have the farm up at the Oregon border.

1:11:54.920 --> 1:11:56.720
 I haven't been there yet, but I've seen the pictures.

1:11:56.720 --> 1:11:59.560
 It looks awesome and I was like, yes.

1:11:59.560 --> 1:12:00.400
 It looks beautiful.

1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:01.360
 Let me know when you're going.

1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:03.240
 Yeah, let's go together.

1:12:03.240 --> 1:12:06.280
 You'll probably run there, but I'll drive there.

1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:09.720
 Yeah, but all that said, I do want to,

1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:12.440
 cause a lot of people who are vegan write to me

1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:14.640
 and I do want to seriously,

1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:17.200
 in the same seriousness that I approached keto,

1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:19.920
 I do wanna go like on a few months

1:12:19.920 --> 1:12:23.320
 to switch to a vegan diet at some point to really try it.

1:12:23.320 --> 1:12:24.320
 I haven't done it yet

1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:26.880
 cause I'm afraid I'm gonna function better.

1:12:26.880 --> 1:12:30.120
 I'm Argentine by my dad's side.

1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:33.600
 And I don't eat meat super often,

1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:36.840
 but well, for most people it would seem often,

1:12:36.840 --> 1:12:40.640
 but I do love steak, I do.

1:12:40.640 --> 1:12:41.920
 So I'm afraid I'm gonna feel better.

1:12:41.920 --> 1:12:43.760
 There's a social element to steak, you're right.

1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:45.400
 Cause coming from a Russian background,

1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:49.240
 like I can't imagine going to visit my folks,

1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:52.080
 like my parents for Thanksgiving or something to say,

1:12:52.080 --> 1:12:55.600
 mom and dad, I don't eat meat.

1:12:55.600 --> 1:12:56.720
 So instead of, you know.

1:12:56.720 --> 1:12:58.000
 Well, I think if you're gonna eat meat,

1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:00.960
 getting it from sources that are compatible

1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:05.200
 with a continuation of the planet is good.

1:13:05.200 --> 1:13:07.200
 I mean, there are some real problems

1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:08.600
 with the factory farm meat.

1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:09.920
 You know, you drive up and down the five

1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:12.360
 and you pass that point where there are all those cows.

1:13:12.360 --> 1:13:16.200
 I mean, as somebody who loves animals,

1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:19.520
 it's clear that it's, you know,

1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:22.200
 you wanna limit the amount of suffering of those animals.

1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:24.040
 Whenever I hear about, you know,

1:13:24.040 --> 1:13:27.000
 we know people that hunt and that go and get their own meat.

1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:28.200
 I really admire that.

1:13:28.200 --> 1:13:30.080
 I admire that people do that.

1:13:30.080 --> 1:13:32.640
 We don't tend to do that in the hills around Stanford,

1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:34.640
 you know, there are mountain lions back there,

1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:35.480
 but that's about it.

1:13:35.480 --> 1:13:40.280
 And I'm certainly, I admire the vegan mindset

1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:41.880
 of just making that decision.

1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:44.160
 You're just not gonna consume other beings,

1:13:44.160 --> 1:13:45.960
 but you know, I haven't gone that way.

1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:49.880
 But performance wise, I'm just curious because I was

1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:53.400
 surprised, I was certain that eating five, six,

1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:55.320
 seven meals a day is the right thing to do

1:13:55.320 --> 1:13:58.840
 for if you wanna be perform your best

1:13:58.840 --> 1:14:01.160
 when I was like 20 or whatever.

1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:04.320
 And I would eat oatmeal, like I thought it's obvious

1:14:04.320 --> 1:14:06.880
 I have to have a really, a lot of carbs in the breakfast.

1:14:06.880 --> 1:14:08.920
 I had a lot of preconceived notions.

1:14:08.920 --> 1:14:12.200
 And then when I started eating like once a day,

1:14:12.200 --> 1:14:14.800
 this was at the peak of my competing in jiu jitsu,

1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:19.800
 it was like, everything I know about nutrition is wrong.

1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:22.680
 You realize that like, you have to become a scientist.

1:14:22.680 --> 1:14:24.320
 First of all, you have to read literature,

1:14:24.320 --> 1:14:26.000
 you have to learn, you have to experiment,

1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:29.080
 but you also have to become a scientist of your own body.

1:14:29.080 --> 1:14:32.040
 In the same way, I have a lot of preconceived notions

1:14:32.040 --> 1:14:35.400
 of what performance is like under vegan diet.

1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:38.000
 And I want to do it right.

1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:42.160
 Like seriously, not necessarily for the ethical reasons,

1:14:42.160 --> 1:14:45.880
 but to see if it's performance wise, like can I,

1:14:45.880 --> 1:14:47.760
 I remember there's like a fruitarian diet

1:14:47.760 --> 1:14:50.000
 where you eat fruit only.

1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:52.520
 These extremes are like, they're pretty,

1:14:52.520 --> 1:14:55.440
 they're interesting cause people have this need.

1:14:55.440 --> 1:14:57.200
 The extremes are informative though, right?

1:14:57.200 --> 1:14:58.840
 I mean, well controlled experiments,

1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:00.760
 you eliminate as many variables as you can

1:15:00.760 --> 1:15:02.040
 except the one you're interested in.

1:15:02.040 --> 1:15:04.520
 So people are running these experiments.

1:15:04.520 --> 1:15:09.480
 I think that it's hard to imagine getting,

1:15:09.480 --> 1:15:12.520
 I know people say you can get enough amino acids

1:15:12.520 --> 1:15:15.200
 from plant based sources and I believe that.

1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:18.480
 I think it probably takes a little more work.

1:15:18.480 --> 1:15:20.640
 One thing that's really clear is that the benefit

1:15:20.640 --> 1:15:23.200
 of these omega three, omega six ratios,

1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:24.840
 like fish oils and things like that.

1:15:24.840 --> 1:15:27.160
 There are some data that show that the getting

1:15:27.160 --> 1:15:30.080
 at least a thousand milligrams of the EPA,

1:15:30.080 --> 1:15:32.240
 which is in high in fish oils, but other things too,

1:15:32.240 --> 1:15:34.840
 even some meats and other plants,

1:15:34.840 --> 1:15:39.840
 it in double, you know, in matched placebo,

1:15:40.120 --> 1:15:41.840
 double blind controlled studies,

1:15:41.840 --> 1:15:43.840
 placebo controlled double blind studies have shown

1:15:43.840 --> 1:15:47.080
 that those can offset antidepressive symptoms

1:15:47.080 --> 1:15:49.720
 as much as some of the selective serotonin reuptake

1:15:49.720 --> 1:15:52.440
 inhibitors like Prozac and Zoloft.

1:15:52.440 --> 1:15:54.280
 So that's pretty impressive.

1:15:54.280 --> 1:15:57.640
 And in Scandinavia, people know, especially in winter,

1:15:57.640 --> 1:16:00.320
 to consume a lot of those omega threes

1:16:00.320 --> 1:16:03.000
 because they're good for you, they're good for the brain.

1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:04.880
 That's the other question.

1:16:04.880 --> 1:16:08.320
 Nutrition wise, what kind of stuff have you come across

1:16:08.320 --> 1:16:09.160
 that's useful?

1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:12.440
 Like I basically only take fish oil,

1:16:12.440 --> 1:16:14.120
 like you said, electrolytes.

1:16:14.120 --> 1:16:18.200
 Electrolytes with water, the David Goggins diet.

1:16:18.200 --> 1:16:19.040
 Fish oil.

1:16:19.040 --> 1:16:19.960
 Plus fish oil.

1:16:19.960 --> 1:16:24.240
 And then again, the sponsor, they made it so easier.

1:16:24.240 --> 1:16:26.640
 The sponsor of your podcast and mine,

1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:28.840
 athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

1:16:28.840 --> 1:16:29.680
 Great stuff.

1:16:29.680 --> 1:16:30.500
 Support it.

1:16:30.500 --> 1:16:34.560
 I don't know, like it's great stuff for sure,

1:16:34.560 --> 1:16:36.700
 but it also just takes away the headache of like,

1:16:36.700 --> 1:16:37.840
 I don't have to think about.

1:16:37.840 --> 1:16:40.280
 Yeah, you're going to get a bunch of vitamins and minerals.

1:16:40.280 --> 1:16:41.360
 It does that.

1:16:41.360 --> 1:16:44.840
 It sounds like a plug, but I have genuinely been buying it.

1:16:44.840 --> 1:16:47.000
 I'm like, you know, no discount, no affiliation

1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:48.560
 or anything since 2012.

1:16:48.560 --> 1:16:50.360
 I think I heard about it on the Tim Ferriss podcast.

1:16:50.360 --> 1:16:52.000
 I was like, oh, I'm going to try that stuff.

1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:52.840
 And I liked it.

1:16:52.840 --> 1:16:54.220
 I mean, when I was starting my lab,

1:16:54.220 --> 1:16:56.200
 I was working insane hours.

1:16:56.200 --> 1:16:57.960
 I still work very long hours.

1:16:57.960 --> 1:17:01.960
 And getting sick limits productivity.

1:17:01.960 --> 1:17:03.240
 And I also wanted to train

1:17:03.240 --> 1:17:05.800
 and I wasn't doing much training back then.

1:17:07.080 --> 1:17:09.720
 Now I try and get, you know, three, four sessions in a week.

1:17:09.720 --> 1:17:11.900
 I'm not doing nothing like what you and David are doing

1:17:11.900 --> 1:17:13.640
 or what, you know, Joe does,

1:17:13.640 --> 1:17:15.640
 or like you guys are way more regimented

1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:16.920
 and consistent than I am.

1:17:17.920 --> 1:17:21.280
 But I think that being healthy and feeling good

1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:24.160
 is one of the great benefits to a career

1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:28.120
 is having energy and just being not sick.

1:17:28.120 --> 1:17:32.000
 Can we take a step back to sleep for a little bit?

1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:37.000
 And so people should definitely look through your podcast.

1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:41.680
 The first five episodes were on sleep or no,

1:17:41.680 --> 1:17:43.960
 I guess the first opening episode wasn't.

1:17:43.960 --> 1:17:46.180
 First one was sort of how the brain works generally

1:17:46.180 --> 1:17:47.960
 is to give people some background.

1:17:47.960 --> 1:17:50.280
 And then we did four episodes on sleep,

1:17:50.280 --> 1:17:52.640
 including some stuff about food, temperature, exercise,

1:17:52.640 --> 1:17:56.120
 jet lag shift work for the jet lag folks and shift work.

1:17:56.120 --> 1:17:57.640
 Yeah, take a masterclass on sleep.

1:17:57.640 --> 1:18:01.900
 And then you're going on to a next topic

1:18:01.900 --> 1:18:04.280
 in the next few episodes, which is incredible.

1:18:04.280 --> 1:18:06.880
 We'll, neuroplasticity, we'll talk about it.

1:18:06.880 --> 1:18:11.880
 But on sleep, one of the cool things about the human mind

1:18:11.980 --> 1:18:13.740
 when it sleeps is dreaming.

1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:17.360
 What do you think we understand

1:18:17.360 --> 1:18:21.040
 about the contents of dreams?

1:18:21.040 --> 1:18:22.720
 Like what do dreams mean?

1:18:22.720 --> 1:18:25.380
 All the stuff we see when we dream,

1:18:25.380 --> 1:18:28.680
 is there something that we understand

1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:32.040
 about the contents of dreams?

1:18:32.040 --> 1:18:33.480
 Some of it is very concrete.

1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:38.480
 So Matt Wilson, who, MIT guy, showed in rodents

1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:40.600
 and it's been shown in nonhuman primates

1:18:40.600 --> 1:18:41.820
 and now it's been shown in humans

1:18:41.820 --> 1:18:46.820
 that there is replay of spatial information during sleep.

1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:50.440
 So initially what Matt showed was that

1:18:50.440 --> 1:18:52.960
 as these little rodents navigate through a maze,

1:18:52.960 --> 1:18:55.320
 there are these cells in the hippocampus called place cells

1:18:55.320 --> 1:18:58.760
 that fire when the animal encounters a turn or a corridor.

1:18:58.760 --> 1:19:02.720
 And that exact same sequence is replayed during sleep.

1:19:02.720 --> 1:19:07.480
 And it turns out this is true in London taxi cab drivers.

1:19:07.480 --> 1:19:11.060
 Before phones and GPS were what they are today,

1:19:11.060 --> 1:19:13.400
 the London taxi cab drivers were famous

1:19:13.400 --> 1:19:15.880
 for knowing the routes through the city,

1:19:15.880 --> 1:19:17.600
 through these mental maps.

1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:21.640
 And their analysis of their place cell firing during sleep

1:19:21.640 --> 1:19:22.700
 and during wakefulness.

1:19:22.700 --> 1:19:25.620
 And so we are essentially taking spatial information

1:19:25.620 --> 1:19:28.160
 about the location of things and replaying it during sleep.

1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:32.280
 However, it's not replayed so that you remember it all.

1:19:32.280 --> 1:19:36.280
 It's replayed so that if there's a reason to remember it,

1:19:36.280 --> 1:19:38.080
 the links to the emotional system,

1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:41.960
 to the components of the limbic system and hypothalamus

1:19:41.960 --> 1:19:43.200
 that are relevant,

1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:45.460
 like you got into a car crash at a particular location,

1:19:45.460 --> 1:19:46.600
 or you lost a bunch of money

1:19:46.600 --> 1:19:48.800
 because you were a cab driver, Uber driver,

1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:49.800
 we'd say nowadays,

1:19:49.800 --> 1:19:52.260
 and you were stuck at one particular avenue all day

1:19:52.260 --> 1:19:53.420
 and frustrated,

1:19:53.420 --> 1:19:55.320
 and you were getting yelled at by your spouse,

1:19:55.320 --> 1:19:57.440
 that information gets encoded

1:19:57.440 --> 1:20:00.440
 so that you never forget that at that particular time of day

1:20:00.440 --> 1:20:02.200
 and that particular time of year,

1:20:02.200 --> 1:20:04.220
 and this thing happened.

1:20:04.220 --> 1:20:06.700
 So context starts getting linked to experience.

1:20:06.700 --> 1:20:08.340
 So there's spatial information

1:20:08.340 --> 1:20:10.720
 that's absolutely replayed during sleep.

1:20:10.720 --> 1:20:13.460
 And we experience this sometimes as dreams.

1:20:13.460 --> 1:20:15.200
 The dreams that happen early in the night

1:20:15.200 --> 1:20:18.520
 when slow wave sleep or non REM sleep dominates,

1:20:18.520 --> 1:20:22.460
 tends to be sleep of very kind of general themes

1:20:22.460 --> 1:20:24.640
 and kind of location.

1:20:24.640 --> 1:20:27.880
 It can feel a little bit eerie and kind of strange.

1:20:27.880 --> 1:20:29.080
 Not so incidentally,

1:20:29.080 --> 1:20:30.100
 the early phase of the night

1:20:30.100 --> 1:20:32.320
 is when growth hormone is released.

1:20:32.320 --> 1:20:33.480
 In the 80s and 90s,

1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:35.080
 there was a drug that was very popular.

1:20:35.080 --> 1:20:37.340
 It's very legal now called GHB.

1:20:38.760 --> 1:20:41.640
 You could actually buy it at GNC or a store then.

1:20:41.640 --> 1:20:43.860
 I never took it, but it was a popular party drug

1:20:43.860 --> 1:20:47.960
 and some famous celebrities died while on GHB.

1:20:47.960 --> 1:20:49.400
 They were also on a bunch of other things,

1:20:49.400 --> 1:20:50.480
 so it's not clear what killed them.

1:20:50.480 --> 1:20:54.080
 But GHB was very big in certain communities

1:20:54.080 --> 1:20:57.740
 because it promoted a massive release of growth hormone

1:20:57.740 --> 1:20:59.920
 and gave people these very hypnotic states.

1:20:59.920 --> 1:21:01.040
 So people go to clubs

1:21:01.040 --> 1:21:02.860
 and they were in these very hypnotic states.

1:21:02.860 --> 1:21:05.220
 It was part of a whole culture.

1:21:05.220 --> 1:21:07.140
 That's early night.

1:21:07.140 --> 1:21:09.920
 And those dreams tend to not have

1:21:09.920 --> 1:21:12.720
 a lot of emotional content or load.

1:21:12.720 --> 1:21:15.040
 That phase of dreaming is associated

1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:18.320
 with the occasional jolting yourself out of sleep

1:21:18.320 --> 1:21:20.120
 because it's somewhat lighter sleep.

1:21:20.120 --> 1:21:22.420
 The dreams that occur during REM,

1:21:22.420 --> 1:21:23.640
 during rapid eye movement sleep

1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:26.520
 and that dominate towards morning are very different.

1:21:26.520 --> 1:21:30.000
 They tend to have very little epinephrine

1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:32.040
 is available in the brain at that time.

1:21:32.040 --> 1:21:33.400
 Epinephrine again being this molecule

1:21:33.400 --> 1:21:35.240
 of stress, fear, and excitement.

1:21:35.240 --> 1:21:38.120
 You are paralyzed during these REM dreams.

1:21:38.120 --> 1:21:39.780
 You cannot move.

1:21:39.780 --> 1:21:41.720
 There's intense emotion

1:21:41.720 --> 1:21:44.500
 at the level of what you're feeling

1:21:44.500 --> 1:21:47.020
 and there's so called theory of mind.

1:21:47.020 --> 1:21:48.880
 Theory of mind is an idea that was put forward

1:21:48.880 --> 1:21:52.480
 by Simon Baron Cohen, Sasha Baron Cohen's cousin.

1:21:52.480 --> 1:21:53.320
 I think on the podcast,

1:21:53.320 --> 1:21:55.800
 I mistakenly said that he was at Oxford.

1:21:55.800 --> 1:21:56.880
 It's like the cardinal sin.

1:21:56.880 --> 1:21:58.300
 He's at Cambridge, forgive me.

1:21:58.300 --> 1:21:59.580
 I'm not British.

1:21:59.580 --> 1:22:02.880
 So the dreams in REM are heavily emotionally laden.

1:22:02.880 --> 1:22:05.840
 And it's very clear that those dreams and REM sleep,

1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:08.580
 if you deprive yourself of them for too long,

1:22:08.580 --> 1:22:12.080
 you become irritable and you start linking

1:22:12.080 --> 1:22:15.660
 generally negative emotions to almost everything.

1:22:15.660 --> 1:22:17.800
 REM, the dreams that occur in REM sleep

1:22:17.800 --> 1:22:21.800
 are when we divorce emotion from our prior experiences.

1:22:21.800 --> 1:22:25.020
 And it's when we extract general rules and themes.

1:22:25.880 --> 1:22:27.500
 MIT seems to have come up a lot today,

1:22:27.500 --> 1:22:29.360
 but it's highly relevant.

1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:32.840
 Susumu Tonagawa, Nobel prize for immunoglobulin,

1:22:32.840 --> 1:22:36.080
 but obviously fantastic neuroscientist as well,

1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:38.880
 has shown that the replay of neurons in the hippocampus

1:22:38.880 --> 1:22:42.200
 and elsewhere in the brain is kind of an approximation

1:22:42.200 --> 1:22:46.720
 of the previous episode and a lot of fear unlearning

1:22:46.720 --> 1:22:50.800
 of uncoupling emotion from hard or traumatic events

1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:53.280
 that happened previously occurs in REM sleep.

1:22:53.280 --> 1:22:55.080
 So you don't want to deprive yourself of REM sleep

1:22:55.080 --> 1:22:55.960
 for too long.

1:22:55.960 --> 1:22:57.680
 And those dreams tend to be very intense.

1:22:57.680 --> 1:22:59.400
 Now, epinephrine is low

1:22:59.400 --> 1:23:02.280
 so that you can't suddenly act out your dreams.

1:23:02.280 --> 1:23:04.880
 But what's interesting is sometimes people

1:23:04.880 --> 1:23:07.920
 will wake up suddenly while in a REM dream

1:23:07.920 --> 1:23:10.440
 and their heart will be beating really, really fast.

1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:12.560
 That's a surge of epinephrine that occurs

1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:14.860
 as you exit REM sleep.

1:23:14.860 --> 1:23:16.920
 So you were having this intense emotional experience

1:23:16.920 --> 1:23:18.120
 without the fear.

1:23:18.120 --> 1:23:20.600
 You were essentially going through therapy in your sleep,

1:23:20.600 --> 1:23:22.040
 self induced therapy.

1:23:22.040 --> 1:23:23.120
 It's like trauma therapy,

1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:26.040
 where you try and divorce the emotion from the experience.

1:23:26.040 --> 1:23:27.600
 And then you wake up.

1:23:27.600 --> 1:23:30.320
 And some people also have the other component of REM,

1:23:30.320 --> 1:23:33.060
 which is atonia, which is paralysis.

1:23:33.060 --> 1:23:36.840
 Pot smokers experience this a lot more than non pot smokers.

1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:40.200
 There's an invasion of paralysis into the waking state.

1:23:40.200 --> 1:23:42.600
 I'm not a pot smoker, but I have experienced this.

1:23:42.600 --> 1:23:44.960
 And when you wake up and you're paralyzed for a second,

1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:46.520
 it's terrifying.

1:23:46.520 --> 1:23:48.760
 But then you jolt yourself alert.

1:23:48.760 --> 1:23:51.460
 So the REM sleep is important

1:23:51.460 --> 1:23:54.680
 for kind of the self induced therapy

1:23:54.680 --> 1:23:56.820
 and forgetting the bad stuff.

1:23:56.820 --> 1:23:59.960
 It's good for uncoupling the emotions from bad experiences.

1:23:59.960 --> 1:24:02.200
 And just there are two therapies.

1:24:02.200 --> 1:24:04.560
 Eye movement desensitization reprocessing,

1:24:04.560 --> 1:24:08.120
 which is a eye movement thing that shuts down the amygdala

1:24:08.120 --> 1:24:09.880
 during therapy, not during sleep.

1:24:09.880 --> 1:24:13.120
 And ketamine, which is a dissociative analgesic.

1:24:13.120 --> 1:24:15.320
 It's actually very similar to PCP.

1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:18.560
 And ketamine is now being used as a trauma therapy

1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:21.320
 when someone comes into the ER, for instance,

1:24:21.320 --> 1:24:22.760
 and they were in a terrible car accident.

1:24:22.760 --> 1:24:24.760
 I mean, these are horrible things to describe it.

1:24:24.760 --> 1:24:26.040
 They saw a relative impaled

1:24:26.040 --> 1:24:28.080
 on the steering column or something.

1:24:28.080 --> 1:24:29.560
 And they will give this drug

1:24:29.560 --> 1:24:31.760
 to try and shut off the emotion system

1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:33.740
 so that, because they're not gonna forget,

1:24:33.740 --> 1:24:36.200
 let's be honest, you don't forget the bad stuff,

1:24:36.200 --> 1:24:39.640
 but it is possible to uncouple the bad events

1:24:39.640 --> 1:24:41.560
 from the emotional system.

1:24:41.560 --> 1:24:42.960
 And there's all sorts of ethical issues

1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:44.580
 about whether or not that's good or bad to do.

1:24:44.580 --> 1:24:48.120
 But PTSD is a failure to uncouple the emotion

1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:50.200
 from these intense experiences.

1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:52.440
 So the goal of this kind of therapy

1:24:52.440 --> 1:24:55.600
 is in the uncoupling for that to be permanent.

1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:56.440
 Yeah.

1:24:56.440 --> 1:24:57.600
 To separate.

1:24:57.600 --> 1:24:59.280
 So they can recount the event

1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:00.360
 and they can describe it

1:25:00.360 --> 1:25:03.120
 without it triggering the same somatic experience

1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:05.160
 of terror and dread,

1:25:05.160 --> 1:25:07.980
 because terror, those feelings can be debilitating,

1:25:07.980 --> 1:25:08.820
 obviously.

1:25:08.820 --> 1:25:10.280
 And you're saying physiologically,

1:25:10.280 --> 1:25:13.160
 in REM sleep, a similar process is happening.

1:25:13.160 --> 1:25:14.360
 That's right.

1:25:14.360 --> 1:25:17.360
 Thematically, REM sleep is about experiencing

1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:19.880
 or replaying intense emotions

1:25:19.880 --> 1:25:22.160
 without experiencing the somatic,

1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:23.600
 the physical component of the emotion,

1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:24.800
 either the acting out

1:25:24.800 --> 1:25:28.200
 or the accelerated heart rate and agitation.

1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:31.600
 Likewise with things like ketamine therapies.

1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:32.440
 That's the idea,

1:25:32.440 --> 1:25:34.360
 is you're uncoupling the physical sensation

1:25:34.360 --> 1:25:36.040
 from the mental events.

1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:39.340
 What is REM sleep and why is it so special?

1:25:39.340 --> 1:25:40.600
 Maybe we can comment on that.

1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:42.240
 Rapid eye movement sleep.

1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:44.880
 Yeah, discovered in the 50s at the University of Chicago.

1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:46.960
 It's intense brain activity,

1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:49.040
 high levels of metabolic activity,

1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:52.100
 dreams in which people report a lot of the theory of mind.

1:25:52.100 --> 1:25:53.880
 We were talking about Simon Baron Cohen.

1:25:53.880 --> 1:25:55.880
 Theory of mind was actually something

1:25:55.880 --> 1:25:58.920
 that he developed for the diagnosis of autism.

1:25:58.920 --> 1:26:03.280
 If you take kids, most kids of age five, six, seven,

1:26:03.280 --> 1:26:05.560
 put them in front of a TV screen in the laboratory

1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:06.560
 and you have them watch a video

1:26:06.560 --> 1:26:08.920
 where a kid is playing with a ball or a doll.

1:26:08.920 --> 1:26:10.840
 And then the kid puts it into a drawer,

1:26:10.840 --> 1:26:12.160
 shuts the drawer and walks away.

1:26:12.160 --> 1:26:14.120
 And another kid comes in and you ask the child

1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:15.680
 who's observing this little movie,

1:26:15.680 --> 1:26:18.520
 you say, what does this second child think?

1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:21.720
 And a typical kid would say,

1:26:21.720 --> 1:26:22.920
 they want to play and they don't know

1:26:22.920 --> 1:26:24.040
 where the ball or doll is,

1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:27.840
 or they're upset or they're sad, they want the doll.

1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:31.580
 Autistic children tend to say the doll's in the drawer.

1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:34.040
 The toy is in the drawer.

1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:35.560
 They tend to fixate.

1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:37.320
 They can't get on the event.

1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:39.120
 They can't get into the mind of that.

1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:40.920
 They don't have a theory of mind.

1:26:40.920 --> 1:26:44.120
 Dreams in REM have a heavy theory of mind component.

1:26:44.120 --> 1:26:46.160
 People are after me trying to get me.

1:26:46.160 --> 1:26:48.400
 You can assign motive to other people.

1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:52.600
 I'm afraid, but it's because there's an expectation.

1:26:52.600 --> 1:26:55.180
 That doesn't tend to happen in slow wave sleep dreams.

1:26:55.180 --> 1:26:57.080
 Now, all this of course is by waking people up

1:26:57.080 --> 1:26:58.640
 and asking them what they were dreaming about,

1:26:58.640 --> 1:27:01.520
 which from a standpoint of a AI guy

1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:04.640
 or a machine learning or a neuroscientist kind of like,

1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:06.320
 but it's the best we've got.

1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:08.980
 But brain imaging in waking states

1:27:08.980 --> 1:27:10.320
 while people view a movie

1:27:10.320 --> 1:27:12.340
 and then brain imaging while people are sleeping

1:27:12.340 --> 1:27:15.360
 supports the idea that that's basically what's going on.

1:27:15.360 --> 1:27:17.260
 So REM sleep is amazing

1:27:17.260 --> 1:27:18.600
 and you're not going to get much of it

1:27:18.600 --> 1:27:21.360
 during your bout with Goggins,

1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:22.920
 but you will afterward.

1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:26.560
 Why, so to comment, why won't I?

1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:30.360
 So is it not possible to get into it real quick?

1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:32.900
 Only if you're very, very sleep deprived,

1:27:32.900 --> 1:27:36.040
 but because you're going to be at high muscular output,

1:27:36.040 --> 1:27:37.000
 that's going to bias you

1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:39.720
 towards more slow wave sleep overall.

1:27:39.720 --> 1:27:43.440
 And your body and brain are smart.

1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:44.720
 They, it will know,

1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:47.960
 they will know that your main goal is to recover

1:27:49.300 --> 1:27:50.300
 so you can keep going.

1:27:50.300 --> 1:27:52.600
 So you can keep firing neuromuscular contractions

1:27:52.600 --> 1:27:54.840
 and you can keep running so that you can,

1:27:54.840 --> 1:27:57.920
 I mean, it's amazing to think like, why do we ever stop?

1:27:57.920 --> 1:27:58.960
 Unlike weight training

1:27:58.960 --> 1:28:03.140
 where I can't do a 500 pound deadlift, I just can't.

1:28:03.140 --> 1:28:03.980
 I could train for it,

1:28:03.980 --> 1:28:07.300
 but I certainly can't do a 600 pound, I can't do that.

1:28:07.300 --> 1:28:10.860
 What causes us to stop an endurance event

1:28:10.860 --> 1:28:12.800
 is usually not a physical barrier.

1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:15.600
 It's almost always a purely mental barrier.

1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:17.800
 And that's a very interesting problem.

1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:19.680
 I mean, neuroscientists don't tend to think about

1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:20.760
 those sorts of problems

1:28:20.760 --> 1:28:23.880
 because it sounds so non neuroscientific,

1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:27.680
 but that's fundamentally related to the question of,

1:28:27.680 --> 1:28:29.520
 what is pursuit?

1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:33.240
 What is the desire to push and to carry on?

1:28:33.240 --> 1:28:34.840
 Is there a neuroscientific answer

1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:36.040
 for that question you think?

1:28:36.040 --> 1:28:38.360
 I think the closest thing is this paper

1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:42.440
 from Janelia Farms, the Howard Hughes campus,

1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:45.440
 showing that if you put animals

1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:47.740
 into a simulated environment

1:28:47.740 --> 1:28:50.120
 where you can measure their effort,

1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:51.680
 the forces while they're running,

1:28:51.680 --> 1:28:53.960
 and you can control the visual environment,

1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:55.080
 and you can create a scenario

1:28:55.080 --> 1:28:58.120
 where the animal thinks that its output is futile.

1:28:58.120 --> 1:29:01.060
 It knows it's running and it's actually running,

1:29:01.060 --> 1:29:03.000
 but you change the frequency of the stripes

1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:05.000
 going by in their visual world,

1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:07.280
 such that they think they're not getting anywhere,

1:29:07.280 --> 1:29:09.280
 and eventually they quit.

1:29:09.280 --> 1:29:11.560
 And the thing that determines whether or not they quit

1:29:11.560 --> 1:29:14.520
 is a threshold level of epinephrine in the brainstem.

1:29:14.520 --> 1:29:16.100
 If you drop that level back down

1:29:16.100 --> 1:29:19.360
 or you give the animals dopamine, essentially,

1:29:19.360 --> 1:29:20.440
 they keep going.

1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:22.540
 If you take dopamine down,

1:29:22.540 --> 1:29:26.120
 they're like, this isn't worth it, it's helpless.

1:29:26.120 --> 1:29:27.720
 This isn't worth my time and energy.

1:29:27.720 --> 1:29:28.880
 Well, this is where the difference

1:29:28.880 --> 1:29:32.840
 between humans and nonhuman animals is interesting,

1:29:32.840 --> 1:29:35.360
 because it does feel like humans have an extra level

1:29:35.360 --> 1:29:40.360
 of cognitive ability that might be relevant here.

1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:44.840
 Well, you can pull from different time references.

1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:46.640
 So if you're in that moment,

1:29:46.640 --> 1:29:49.500
 you're going to need a kit of things to pull from.

1:29:49.500 --> 1:29:52.720
 So you can think this is in honor of someone else

1:29:52.720 --> 1:29:54.000
 that passed away,

1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:58.240
 and you will find a gas reserve that's amazing, right?

1:29:58.240 --> 1:30:00.140
 Now, whether or not mice are like,

1:30:00.140 --> 1:30:02.360
 I remember my brother back in the other cage

1:30:02.360 --> 1:30:05.080
 when I was a little mouse, we don't know.

1:30:05.080 --> 1:30:08.480
 But it's very likely that they don't do that,

1:30:08.480 --> 1:30:09.660
 that they're so present,

1:30:09.660 --> 1:30:12.520
 they're in the experience of there and then and now,

1:30:12.520 --> 1:30:16.000
 that they aren't able to extract from the past,

1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:18.380
 and they're not able to project into the future,

1:30:18.380 --> 1:30:19.760
 like how great it's gonna feel

1:30:19.760 --> 1:30:23.600
 when I get to the end of this really lame VR corridor.

1:30:23.600 --> 1:30:25.080
 I don't think they think about that.

1:30:25.080 --> 1:30:28.680
 And think about like, if I quit now,

1:30:28.680 --> 1:30:29.720
 how will that have,

1:30:29.720 --> 1:30:31.740
 what kind of effect will it have on the rest of my life

1:30:31.740 --> 1:30:33.560
 in the future difficult times?

1:30:33.560 --> 1:30:35.160
 Like if you allow yourself to quit

1:30:35.160 --> 1:30:36.260
 in this particular moment,

1:30:36.260 --> 1:30:38.240
 you'll become a quitter more and more in life,

1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:41.480
 and then you're going to not get the other nice,

1:30:41.480 --> 1:30:45.000
 the opposite sex mammals.

1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:46.920
 That's pretty severe, you went there.

1:30:46.920 --> 1:30:48.120
 I don't know.

1:30:48.120 --> 1:30:50.280
 You took it the whole way to evolution and back again.

1:30:50.280 --> 1:30:51.680
 I mean, but that's really it.

1:30:51.680 --> 1:30:54.240
 I mean, our ability to time reference

1:30:54.240 --> 1:30:56.120
 in the past, present or future.

1:30:56.120 --> 1:30:59.340
 I do believe that we can be in the present and the past,

1:30:59.340 --> 1:31:02.420
 or the present and the future, or only in the present,

1:31:02.420 --> 1:31:04.200
 or only in the future, only in the past.

1:31:04.200 --> 1:31:05.760
 But I don't think that we can really think

1:31:05.760 --> 1:31:08.200
 about past, present and future all at once.

1:31:08.200 --> 1:31:10.880
 And this has a similarity to covert attention.

1:31:10.880 --> 1:31:13.760
 Like we can split our visual attention into two things.

1:31:13.760 --> 1:31:16.840
 We really can do a task, even though we can't multitask.

1:31:16.840 --> 1:31:18.640
 Or we can bring those two spotlights of attention

1:31:18.640 --> 1:31:20.100
 to the same location.

1:31:20.100 --> 1:31:23.200
 But it's very hard to split our attention in really well

1:31:23.200 --> 1:31:26.580
 into three domains, excuse me, into three domains.

1:31:26.580 --> 1:31:29.280
 I think that that's very, very challenging.

1:31:29.280 --> 1:31:34.280
 And our time referencing scheme tends to be just one

1:31:34.320 --> 1:31:36.960
 or two time references.

1:31:36.960 --> 1:31:39.800
 So Lisa Feldman Barrett, I'm not sure

1:31:39.800 --> 1:31:40.760
 if you've done work together,

1:31:40.760 --> 1:31:41.680
 but at least you're connected.

1:31:41.680 --> 1:31:43.800
 I found out about her because of you,

1:31:43.800 --> 1:31:45.000
 on your podcast with her.

1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:46.280
 And then I brought her on to Instagram,

1:31:46.280 --> 1:31:48.360
 doing an Instagram live about emotion.

1:31:48.360 --> 1:31:49.480
 And it was fascinating.

1:31:49.480 --> 1:31:53.560
 And she's a very spirited and very, very smart woman.

1:31:53.560 --> 1:31:55.360
 Fearless and brilliant.

1:31:55.360 --> 1:31:57.920
 So I love her, she's amazing.

1:31:57.920 --> 1:32:02.160
 She kind of, she's not a scholar of hallucinogens

1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:04.720
 or dreams, but she had this intuition

1:32:04.720 --> 1:32:09.320
 that there may be a connection between the kind

1:32:09.320 --> 1:32:11.880
 of dissociation that happens in dreaming

1:32:11.880 --> 1:32:16.880
 and that happens in like psychedelics.

1:32:16.920 --> 1:32:20.440
 I, because of my previous conversation with you

1:32:21.880 --> 1:32:25.040
 on this podcast, Matthew Johnson

1:32:25.040 --> 1:32:28.040
 from Johns Hopkins reached out and he said,

1:32:28.040 --> 1:32:32.720
 but he commented, I think, on something that we commented

1:32:32.720 --> 1:32:34.280
 on, I don't even remember exactly what,

1:32:34.280 --> 1:32:36.600
 but that there's not many studies.

1:32:36.600 --> 1:32:40.760
 It's not being psychedelics and not being rigorously studied

1:32:40.760 --> 1:32:44.680
 in an academic setting, like with a full rigor of science.

1:32:44.680 --> 1:32:48.040
 And he said, well, actually that's exactly what we're doing

1:32:48.040 --> 1:32:50.160
 and they're extremely well funded now.

1:32:50.160 --> 1:32:53.000
 And it's been a long battle to get it accepted

1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:55.760
 as a serious scientific pursuit.

1:32:55.760 --> 1:33:00.000
 So, but, and I'd like to ask you a little bit about that,

1:33:00.000 --> 1:33:04.160
 but do you have a sense about connection

1:33:04.160 --> 1:33:07.680
 between dreams and psychedelics or these different

1:33:07.680 --> 1:33:10.520
 explorations of mind states that are outside

1:33:10.520 --> 1:33:14.480
 of the standard normal one, that's the wake mindset?

1:33:14.480 --> 1:33:16.560
 Yeah, I loved your discussion with Matthew.

1:33:16.560 --> 1:33:19.320
 I knew of the Hopkins group and the stuff they were doing,

1:33:19.320 --> 1:33:21.800
 but I didn't know much about it at all.

1:33:21.800 --> 1:33:23.480
 And I learned a ton from that podcast.

1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:25.640
 I reached out to him just to say,

1:33:25.640 --> 1:33:26.480
 I love what you're doing.

1:33:26.480 --> 1:33:27.360
 I think it's incredible.

1:33:27.360 --> 1:33:29.280
 So yeah, your podcast has been a great source

1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:34.280
 of serious academic and intellectual conversation for me.

1:33:35.320 --> 1:33:38.560
 I think what they're doing at Hopkins is amazing.

1:33:38.560 --> 1:33:40.520
 He has a collaborator there actually

1:33:40.520 --> 1:33:42.000
 that had a very popular paper.

1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:43.520
 I just throw out there for fun,

1:33:44.440 --> 1:33:46.320
 who is a postdoc at Stanford.

1:33:46.320 --> 1:33:47.840
 Her name is Gul.

1:33:47.840 --> 1:33:50.160
 She's Turkish, I believe.

1:33:50.160 --> 1:33:54.520
 And I apologize, her last name escapes me at the moment,

1:33:54.520 --> 1:33:57.200
 but that's just a function of my brain.

1:33:57.200 --> 1:34:01.640
 She had a paper showing that she put octopi on MDMA

1:34:01.640 --> 1:34:04.000
 on ecstasy and found out, this is published

1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:07.200
 in current biology, it was a great journal,

1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:10.000
 showing that the octopi then wanted to spend more time

1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:12.560
 with other octopi and they started cuddling.

1:34:12.560 --> 1:34:14.800
 So they're colleagues out there.

1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:19.080
 But the Hopkins project is super interesting

1:34:19.080 --> 1:34:21.680
 because I think they were initially supported mainly

1:34:21.680 --> 1:34:23.200
 through private philanthropy.

1:34:23.200 --> 1:34:25.480
 And now you're starting to see some more interest

1:34:25.480 --> 1:34:28.960
 at the level of NIH about psychedelics.

1:34:28.960 --> 1:34:32.280
 It's a complicated space because the psychedelics

1:34:32.280 --> 1:34:36.280
 are always looked at through the lens of the 60s

1:34:36.280 --> 1:34:37.640
 and people losing their mind.

1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:40.600
 And there's a, I always say,

1:34:40.600 --> 1:34:42.600
 you don't want a Ken Kesey out of the game.

1:34:42.600 --> 1:34:43.840
 Ken Kesey was amazing, right,

1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:45.320
 part of the whole beat generation thing.

1:34:45.320 --> 1:34:48.200
 And he was actually at the VA near Stanford.

1:34:48.200 --> 1:34:49.560
 That's where he eventually, in Menlo Park,

1:34:49.560 --> 1:34:51.200
 he wrote One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,

1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:52.360
 or maybe that was about him.

1:34:52.360 --> 1:34:55.160
 Anyway, the comments will tell me how wrong I am,

1:34:55.160 --> 1:34:57.040
 but I think I'm tossing these words

1:34:57.040 --> 1:34:59.640
 in the right general direction.

1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:04.640
 But Huxley, Kesey, they did a lot of LSD

1:35:05.480 --> 1:35:08.320
 and they all lost their jobs, right?

1:35:08.320 --> 1:35:10.040
 They lost their jobs at big institutions

1:35:10.040 --> 1:35:13.480
 like Harvard and Stanford and elsewhere, or they left

1:35:13.480 --> 1:35:18.040
 because they made themselves the experiments.

1:35:18.040 --> 1:35:21.160
 Hopkins, as far as I know, is one of the first places,

1:35:21.160 --> 1:35:23.960
 if not the first place, where whatever Matt

1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:26.560
 may or may not be doing in his own life, I don't know.

1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:27.760
 It's really about the patients

1:35:27.760 --> 1:35:29.160
 and whether or not the patients

1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:32.840
 in these institutional review board approved studies,

1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:34.200
 whether or not they're getting better

1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:35.800
 in situations like depression.

1:35:35.800 --> 1:35:40.240
 I think it's clear that there's a very close relationship

1:35:40.240 --> 1:35:43.280
 between hallucinogenic states and dreaming

1:35:43.280 --> 1:35:45.680
 of the sort that were described for REM dreaming.

1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:48.400
 And there's a terrific set of books

1:35:48.400 --> 1:35:49.880
 and body of scientific literature

1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:51.560
 from a guy named Allan Hobson,

1:35:51.560 --> 1:35:53.680
 who was an MD, is at Harvard Med,

1:35:53.680 --> 1:35:56.360
 and he wrote books like Dream Drugstore.

1:35:56.360 --> 1:35:58.000
 One of the first neuroscience books I ever read

1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:00.760
 was about hallucinations and how psychedelics

1:36:00.760 --> 1:36:02.280
 and dreaming are very similar.

1:36:02.280 --> 1:36:03.480
 That was way back when I was in high school.

1:36:03.480 --> 1:36:04.800
 I was just curious.

1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:07.040
 And he really understood the relationship

1:36:07.040 --> 1:36:10.960
 between LSD and REM dreams and how similar they are.

1:36:10.960 --> 1:36:14.520
 I think psychedelics, and Matt knows way more about this

1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:17.400
 than I do, of course, but psychedelics

1:36:17.400 --> 1:36:19.640
 have some very interesting properties.

1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:21.640
 They are certainly not for everybody, right?

1:36:21.640 --> 1:36:23.920
 And kids, it's a problem.

1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:25.640
 I think the major issues right now

1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:29.240
 around the psychedelic conversation is that it's clear

1:36:29.240 --> 1:36:33.040
 that they can unveil certain elements of neuroplasticity.

1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:35.520
 They make the brain amenable to change,

1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:37.400
 changing up space time relationships,

1:36:37.400 --> 1:36:39.760
 changing up the emotional load of an event

1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:41.480
 and being able to reframe that.

1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:43.240
 It's clear that happens.

1:36:43.240 --> 1:36:45.160
 But there's two major issues.

1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:47.960
 One is that people talk about plasticity

1:36:47.960 --> 1:36:50.200
 as if plasticity is the goal,

1:36:50.200 --> 1:36:52.200
 but plasticity is a state within which

1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:53.640
 you can direct neurology.

1:36:53.640 --> 1:36:56.800
 And the question is what changes are you trying to get to?

1:36:56.800 --> 1:36:58.640
 So people are just taking psychedelics

1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:02.160
 to unveil plasticity without thinking about

1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:04.600
 what circuits they want to modify and how.

1:37:04.600 --> 1:37:06.360
 I think that's a problem.

1:37:06.360 --> 1:37:08.440
 I think there's great potential, however,

1:37:08.440 --> 1:37:12.240
 for people opening up these states of plasticity

1:37:12.240 --> 1:37:13.520
 with psychedelics or otherwise,

1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:16.180
 and directing the plastic changes

1:37:16.180 --> 1:37:17.480
 toward a particular end point.

1:37:17.480 --> 1:37:20.280
 And there's an absolutely spectacular paper

1:37:20.280 --> 1:37:23.800
 out of UC Davis published as a full article in Nature

1:37:23.800 --> 1:37:25.400
 just a couple of months ago,

1:37:25.400 --> 1:37:28.380
 showing that there are psychedelics

1:37:28.380 --> 1:37:30.100
 that are now can be modified.

1:37:30.100 --> 1:37:31.880
 So chemists have gotten into the game now

1:37:31.880 --> 1:37:34.440
 and modifying to take away the hallucinogenic component

1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:37.760
 where you still get the neuroplasticity components.

1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:40.460
 And for a lot of people it'd be like, oh, that's no fun.

1:37:40.460 --> 1:37:43.140
 That's not giving you the wild experience.

1:37:43.140 --> 1:37:45.140
 But I do think that that holds great potential

1:37:45.140 --> 1:37:47.760
 for people that wouldn't otherwise orient

1:37:47.760 --> 1:37:48.740
 towards some of these drugs.

1:37:48.740 --> 1:37:51.360
 So I think it's really marvelous what's happening

1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:52.600
 and what's about to happen.

1:37:52.600 --> 1:37:57.500
 And I think there is one drug in that kit of drugs

1:37:57.500 --> 1:38:00.880
 that's very unusual, like psilocybin, LSD,

1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:04.160
 those promote heavy, heavy serotonin release

1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:06.940
 and lateralized connections ramp up, et cetera.

1:38:06.940 --> 1:38:08.320
 Matt talked about all that.

1:38:08.320 --> 1:38:13.280
 But MDMA, ecstasy, is a very unusual situation

1:38:13.280 --> 1:38:16.120
 where dopamine is very, very high

1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:18.840
 because of the way the drug is designed.

1:38:18.840 --> 1:38:21.100
 Dopamine release, it goes through the roof.

1:38:21.100 --> 1:38:23.880
 So people feel great and they want to move

1:38:23.880 --> 1:38:25.320
 and they have a lot of energy.

1:38:25.320 --> 1:38:27.640
 But serotonin levels are also high

1:38:27.640 --> 1:38:30.420
 and that's a very unnatural state.

1:38:30.420 --> 1:38:35.040
 And why MDMA may, and I want to highlight may,

1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:38.280
 have particularly high potential

1:38:38.280 --> 1:38:41.400
 for the treatment of certain forms of depression

1:38:41.400 --> 1:38:43.160
 is an interesting question.

1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:47.640
 Because never before, as far as we know in human history,

1:38:47.640 --> 1:38:51.440
 has there been a possibility of opening up dopaminergic

1:38:51.440 --> 1:38:53.080
 and serotonergic states at the same time,

1:38:53.080 --> 1:38:55.180
 dopamine being the molecule pursuit and reward

1:38:55.180 --> 1:38:58.640
 and more and more, and serotonin being one of bliss

1:38:58.640 --> 1:39:00.100
 and being content right where you're at.

1:39:00.100 --> 1:39:02.400
 So it's almost like those two things wrap back on themselves

1:39:02.400 --> 1:39:04.520
 and create this very unusual state.

1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:06.360
 And I think the bigger conversation

1:39:06.360 --> 1:39:08.160
 is what to do with a state like that.

1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:11.280
 Like is it about self love?

1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:13.480
 Is it about developing love for another person?

1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:15.280
 Is it about forgetting hate?

1:39:15.280 --> 1:39:17.240
 Like these are powerful molecules.

1:39:17.240 --> 1:39:19.240
 And I think if the academic community

1:39:19.240 --> 1:39:20.880
 and the clinical community is going to move forward

1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:22.600
 with them in any serious way,

1:39:22.600 --> 1:39:24.400
 I think there needs to be a conversation

1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:28.360
 about what they're being used for.

1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:30.480
 Right, and coupled with that,

1:39:30.480 --> 1:39:32.840
 I think similar to what you're saying,

1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:34.060
 like Matt has talked about,

1:39:34.060 --> 1:39:35.820
 as others have talked about,

1:39:35.820 --> 1:39:39.980
 some of the biggest benefits of like progress,

1:39:39.980 --> 1:39:41.360
 whether it's like quitting smoking

1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:45.280
 and all this kind of stuff is in the days after,

1:39:45.280 --> 1:39:47.600
 it's the integration of the experience.

1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:50.680
 So maybe you open up the brain to the neuroplasticity,

1:39:50.680 --> 1:39:52.320
 but then there's like work to be done.

1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:57.320
 It's not, you shake up something in the biology of the brain

1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:00.100
 but you have to do then it's work.

1:40:00.100 --> 1:40:03.440
 Absolutely, a friend of mine who's a physician,

1:40:03.440 --> 1:40:06.600
 he says, who's quite open to this idea

1:40:06.600 --> 1:40:10.400
 that psychedelics could play a real role in real medicine.

1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:12.240
 Says, better living through chemistry

1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:14.440
 still requires better living.

1:40:14.440 --> 1:40:16.560
 And I think it's a beautiful statement.

1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:19.920
 I wish I had said it, but he gets the credit.

1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:22.640
 But the plasticity window opens.

1:40:22.640 --> 1:40:24.640
 And then as you said, what are you going to do in the two

1:40:24.640 --> 1:40:26.400
 weeks, three weeks, four weeks afterward?

1:40:26.400 --> 1:40:28.300
 Because that's the real opportunity.

1:40:28.300 --> 1:40:30.680
 But those psychedelic experiences are really a case

1:40:30.680 --> 1:40:33.160
 of an amplified experience inside of an amplified

1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:36.840
 experience so much so that everything seems relevant.

1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:39.800
 And it's fascinating.

1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:43.980
 I mean, my hope is that the AI and machine learning

1:40:43.980 --> 1:40:45.640
 and the brain machine interface and all that

1:40:45.640 --> 1:40:49.620
 will eventually be merged with the psychedelic treatments

1:40:49.620 --> 1:40:52.320
 so that an individual can go in,

1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:55.000
 take whatever amount of whatever's safe for them,

1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:57.600
 working with a clinician and really direct the plasticity

1:40:57.600 --> 1:41:01.960
 while maybe stimulating the medial frontal cortex

1:41:01.960 --> 1:41:04.640
 or increasing the observer or decreasing the observer

1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:06.480
 in the brain or decreasing the amygdala.

1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:07.960
 I mean, it's doable.

1:41:07.960 --> 1:41:11.080
 It's doable with transcranial magnetic stimulation

1:41:11.080 --> 1:41:12.720
 and it's for shutting down activity

1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:14.600
 and it's doable with ultrasound.

1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:17.440
 Ultrasound now allows very focal activation

1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:19.940
 of particular brain regions through the skull,

1:41:19.940 --> 1:41:21.040
 noninvasively.

1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:23.960
 So it's approaching the same kind of therapy

1:41:23.960 --> 1:41:24.880
 from different angles.

1:41:24.880 --> 1:41:28.440
 One AI is the computational size of injecting

1:41:28.440 --> 1:41:32.400
 like the robotics injecting like maybe you can even think

1:41:32.400 --> 1:41:35.760
 about it as like electricity, the electrical approach

1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:38.600
 versus then like the chemical approach.

1:41:38.600 --> 1:41:39.440
 Absolutely.

1:41:39.440 --> 1:41:42.800
 And then the psychology is subjective, right?

1:41:42.800 --> 1:41:45.960
 So it's gonna take some real understanding

1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:49.540
 of what that person's lexicon is.

1:41:49.540 --> 1:41:51.520
 Like, you know, that wasn't a pun, sorry.

1:41:51.520 --> 1:41:55.120
 I'm sorry, it's terrible, I'm like the worst.

1:41:55.120 --> 1:41:57.380
 That's the one thing I know from the feedback on my podcast.

1:41:57.380 --> 1:42:00.080
 My jokes are terrible, but I never claimed to be funny.

1:42:02.180 --> 1:42:04.720
 But somebody who they really trust

1:42:04.720 --> 1:42:08.160
 and understands when somebody says, you know,

1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:10.520
 for a very stoic person, like I'm imagining

1:42:10.520 --> 1:42:12.760
 you interviewed the great Dan Gable, right?

1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:13.880
 I don't know anything about Dan,

1:42:13.880 --> 1:42:15.520
 but can you imagine like you ask Dan,

1:42:15.520 --> 1:42:17.040
 like, you know, how you feel about something

1:42:17.040 --> 1:42:18.320
 while on one of these drugs?

1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:21.720
 And like, I mean, his languaging might,

1:42:21.720 --> 1:42:24.280
 if he says that was troubling,

1:42:24.280 --> 1:42:26.000
 it might mean that it was very troubling

1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:27.360
 or not troubling at all.

1:42:27.360 --> 1:42:31.300
 So people are, language is a poor guide

1:42:31.300 --> 1:42:33.720
 because if I say I'm upset, how upset is that?

1:42:33.720 --> 1:42:35.360
 Well, that's very subjective.

1:42:35.360 --> 1:42:38.400
 So you need, we need, can you build a tool for that?

1:42:38.400 --> 1:42:39.720
 Can you build an AI tool for that?

1:42:39.720 --> 1:42:40.840
 Yeah, deeper, yeah, well.

1:42:40.840 --> 1:42:43.380
 Maybe that's the eye, maybe that's our,

1:42:43.380 --> 1:42:44.920
 that's what the eyes could reveal.

1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:47.400
 So language is not just words, it's everything together.

1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:50.480
 And that's one of the fascinating things about the eyes

1:42:50.480 --> 1:42:51.520
 and the window to the soul.

1:42:51.520 --> 1:42:54.360
 I mean, they express so much, the face, the eyes,

1:42:54.360 --> 1:42:57.600
 the body, I mean, Lisa talks about that,

1:42:57.600 --> 1:43:01.120
 the communication of emotions, it's a super complex.

1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:04.880
 Perhaps it's a bit of a side fun tangent,

1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:09.880
 but Matt, Matthew Johnson brings up DMT

1:43:10.400 --> 1:43:15.400
 and the experience of DMT is from a scientific perspective,

1:43:16.200 --> 1:43:20.360
 just a mystery in itself over its intensity

1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:21.880
 of what happens to the brain.

1:43:21.880 --> 1:43:25.760
 And of course, Joe Rogan and others bring it up

1:43:25.760 --> 1:43:30.360
 as a very different special kind of experience

1:43:31.960 --> 1:43:34.880
 and elves seem to come up often.

1:43:34.880 --> 1:43:38.740
 I've never tried DMT, what allows for hallucinogenic states?

1:43:38.740 --> 1:43:41.960
 And it, I mean, DMT is a really interesting molecule.

1:43:41.960 --> 1:43:46.960
 There are a lot of people experimenting now with DMT

1:43:46.960 --> 1:43:51.960
 and the way they've described it is as a kind of a freight

1:43:54.320 --> 1:43:56.760
 train through space and time, very different

1:43:56.760 --> 1:43:59.040
 than the way people describe LSD type experiences

1:43:59.040 --> 1:44:02.160
 or psilocybin where time and space are very fluid,

1:44:02.160 --> 1:44:05.340
 but it tends to be a kind of a slower role, if you will.

1:44:06.740 --> 1:44:10.240
 So it's clear that DMT is tapping into a brain state

1:44:10.240 --> 1:44:13.860
 that's distinctly different than the other psychedelics.

1:44:13.860 --> 1:44:17.920
 And you mentioned jujitsu and these other communities.

1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:21.600
 I mean, I think it's interesting because jujitsu

1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:24.260
 is a nonverbal activity and people get together

1:44:24.260 --> 1:44:26.360
 and talk about this nonverbal activity

1:44:26.360 --> 1:44:28.180
 and they show great love for it in the same way

1:44:28.180 --> 1:44:32.020
 that surfers, I've known some surfers in my time

1:44:32.020 --> 1:44:35.040
 and they will get up at the crack of dawn

1:44:35.040 --> 1:44:37.140
 and drive really, really far to sit in the water

1:44:37.140 --> 1:44:38.200
 and wait for this wave to come.

1:44:38.200 --> 1:44:40.880
 I have to imagine it's pretty fantastic.

1:44:40.880 --> 1:44:44.640
 I think that human beings now,

1:44:44.640 --> 1:44:46.400
 some of whom are in the scientific community

1:44:46.400 --> 1:44:48.800
 are starting to feel comfortable enough to talk about

1:44:48.800 --> 1:44:51.360
 some of these other loves and other endeavors

1:44:51.360 --> 1:44:54.080
 because they do reveal a certain component

1:44:54.080 --> 1:44:55.960
 about our underlying neurology.

1:44:55.960 --> 1:45:00.960
 I'm fascinated by the concept of wordlessness,

1:45:01.040 --> 1:45:04.920
 activities in which language is just not sufficient

1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:09.560
 to capture and in which feel so vital as a reset,

1:45:09.560 --> 1:45:11.680
 as important as sleep.

1:45:11.680 --> 1:45:13.360
 I think that's one of the dangers of the phone

1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:15.480
 is not that you're going to get into some online battle

1:45:15.480 --> 1:45:16.680
 or that you're always staring at the phone

1:45:16.680 --> 1:45:17.960
 is that it's a words.

1:45:17.960 --> 1:45:20.800
 As we read things, we're hearing the script in our head.

1:45:20.800 --> 1:45:23.500
 And I think getting into states

1:45:23.500 --> 1:45:26.480
 where we are in a state of wordlessness

1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:31.480
 is very renewing and replenishing and just can feel amazing.

1:45:31.920 --> 1:45:36.080
 And I believe also can help us tap into creative states

1:45:36.080 --> 1:45:38.600
 and allow our neurology to access creative states.

1:45:38.600 --> 1:45:42.800
 And sleep is one such wordlessness, period.

1:45:42.800 --> 1:45:45.880
 So one of the most interesting things to me

1:45:45.880 --> 1:45:48.360
 are states that one can approach in waking,

1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:51.800
 non sleep depressed, wordlessness through,

1:45:51.800 --> 1:45:54.200
 maybe it's jujitsu, maybe it's for some people surfing,

1:45:54.200 --> 1:45:56.240
 maybe it's dancing, maybe it's just,

1:45:56.240 --> 1:45:58.260
 I don't know, staring at a wall, who knows?

1:45:58.260 --> 1:46:01.400
 But where the language components of the brain

1:46:01.400 --> 1:46:03.240
 are completely shut down.

1:46:03.240 --> 1:46:06.560
 And it has to be the case that drugs are no drugs,

1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:10.640
 that the brain is entering and starting to states

1:46:10.640 --> 1:46:12.120
 and starting to use algorithms

1:46:12.120 --> 1:46:13.240
 that are distinctly different

1:46:13.240 --> 1:46:15.540
 than when we're trying to compose things

1:46:15.540 --> 1:46:17.800
 in any kind of coherent way for someone else to understand.

1:46:17.800 --> 1:46:20.200
 There's no interest in anyone else understanding

1:46:20.200 --> 1:46:22.360
 what you're experiencing in that moment.

1:46:22.360 --> 1:46:23.560
 And that's beautiful.

1:46:23.560 --> 1:46:27.760
 And I think it's not just beautiful because it feels good.

1:46:27.760 --> 1:46:29.800
 I think it's beautiful because it's important

1:46:29.800 --> 1:46:32.760
 and it's clearly fundamental to our neurology.

1:46:32.760 --> 1:46:35.860
 And your sense is there's a connection between dreams

1:46:35.860 --> 1:46:37.160
 and DMT and like psychedelic,

1:46:37.160 --> 1:46:41.680
 like all of the, you can understand one

1:46:41.680 --> 1:46:42.680
 by studying the other.

1:46:42.680 --> 1:46:46.240
 So for example, dreams are also very difficult to study,

1:46:46.240 --> 1:46:48.240
 but they're more accessible.

1:46:48.240 --> 1:46:49.920
 It's safer to study.

1:46:49.920 --> 1:46:51.880
 And we're told we need to get more of it.

1:46:51.880 --> 1:46:54.380
 Whereas with psychedelics, there's this big question mark.

1:46:54.380 --> 1:46:56.300
 Is it gonna make everyone crazy?

1:46:56.300 --> 1:46:58.060
 Is it gonna be legal?

1:46:58.060 --> 1:47:00.120
 I mean, it's kind of interesting how,

1:47:00.120 --> 1:47:02.400
 if one looks on Instagram,

1:47:02.400 --> 1:47:04.800
 one could almost think that these drugs are already legal

1:47:04.800 --> 1:47:06.800
 based on the way that people commute, but they're not yet.

1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:08.320
 There's still a lot of them are scheduled.

1:47:08.320 --> 1:47:10.480
 And there's a lot of questions.

1:47:10.480 --> 1:47:13.560
 I mean, but nevertheless, it's like,

1:47:15.160 --> 1:47:18.640
 my hope is that science opens up

1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:21.800
 to these drugs a little bit more.

1:47:21.800 --> 1:47:24.420
 It's just, I have this intuition that,

1:47:24.420 --> 1:47:25.780
 like a lot of people share,

1:47:25.780 --> 1:47:30.780
 that they would be able to unlock deeper understanding

1:47:30.960 --> 1:47:31.800
 of our own mind.

1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:34.840
 It's any kind of, same as studying dreams.

1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:35.680
 Absolutely.

1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:39.360
 Well, creativity is in the nonlinearities, right?

1:47:39.360 --> 1:47:43.120
 But productivity is in the implementation of linearities.

1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:45.760
 I mean, that's what is absolutely clear.

1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:47.320
 This is why I think we were talking earlier

1:47:47.320 --> 1:47:49.920
 about why a formal rigorous training in something

1:47:49.920 --> 1:47:51.200
 where other people are looking at you

1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:52.640
 and telling you, no, not good enough,

1:47:52.640 --> 1:47:54.020
 go back and do it again.

1:47:54.020 --> 1:47:55.320
 There's real value to that

1:47:55.320 --> 1:47:57.080
 because otherwise it's just ideas.

1:47:57.080 --> 1:47:58.560
 It's just vapors.

1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:01.240
 You know, one thing that Matt mentioned

1:48:01.240 --> 1:48:04.920
 as the study that they're working on is,

1:48:04.920 --> 1:48:07.680
 as opposed to, I think most of the psychedelic studies

1:48:07.680 --> 1:48:12.040
 they've done is on how to treat different conditions.

1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:13.680
 And one of the things they're working on now

1:48:13.680 --> 1:48:18.160
 is to try to do a study where, for creatives,

1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:20.200
 for people that don't have a condition

1:48:20.200 --> 1:48:21.040
 that they're trying to treat,

1:48:21.040 --> 1:48:23.840
 but instead see how this,

1:48:23.840 --> 1:48:26.000
 how psychedelics can help you create.

1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:26.840
 So like.

1:48:26.840 --> 1:48:27.660
 Goodness.

1:48:27.660 --> 1:48:29.740
 If you take creatives and you give them more psychedelics,

1:48:29.740 --> 1:48:31.680
 they're not gonna be able to get out of their room.

1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:32.640
 I don't know.

1:48:32.640 --> 1:48:34.400
 Well, but this is the,

1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:37.320
 maybe you can speak to that, psychedelics or not,

1:48:37.320 --> 1:48:40.600
 or dreams or tools in general, how to be better creatives.

1:48:40.600 --> 1:48:42.080
 That's an interesting,

1:48:42.080 --> 1:48:44.680
 I don't often see studies of this nature

1:48:44.680 --> 1:48:47.000
 of like how to take high performers

1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:50.840
 in the mental creative space

1:48:50.840 --> 1:48:53.680
 and get them to perform even better.

1:48:53.680 --> 1:48:55.640
 So it's not average people.

1:48:55.640 --> 1:48:58.860
 It's like masters of their craft, like taking,

1:48:58.860 --> 1:49:01.480
 I mean, his examples was taking an Elon Musk,

1:49:01.480 --> 1:49:04.240
 which is in the engineering space and maybe musicians

1:49:04.240 --> 1:49:06.520
 and all that kind of stuff and studying that.

1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:09.520
 That's a, I mean, that's weird.

1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:13.680
 Usually the science, the scientific exploration there

1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:16.800
 has been done by the musicians themselves,

1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:17.920
 as has been documented.

1:49:17.920 --> 1:49:21.380
 Like jazz is like all nonlinearities, right?

1:49:21.380 --> 1:49:23.660
 But if it's, but the people still have to know

1:49:23.660 --> 1:49:25.760
 how to play their instruments, right?

1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:29.600
 There's some early skill building that's critical.

1:49:29.600 --> 1:49:32.120
 I mean, when you mentioned someone like Elon,

1:49:32.120 --> 1:49:34.600
 I mean, virtual, I mean, he's already a virtuoso, right?

1:49:34.600 --> 1:49:36.440
 Cause he, and in so many different domains,

1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:39.240
 I've never met him, but it's clear, right?

1:49:39.240 --> 1:49:42.880
 He, it's not just that he's ambitious and bold and brave

1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:44.280
 and all that, it's all that.

1:49:44.280 --> 1:49:49.160
 And there's clearly a different way of looking

1:49:49.160 --> 1:49:51.560
 at the same problems that everyone else is looking at.

1:49:51.560 --> 1:49:53.320
 And people are probably banging their head

1:49:53.320 --> 1:49:55.200
 against the refrigerator thinking like, think differently,

1:49:55.200 --> 1:49:56.800
 think it doesn't work that way.

1:49:56.800 --> 1:50:00.400
 It involves, there's a certain anxiety in for the,

1:50:00.400 --> 1:50:03.860
 I'm not talking about for Elon, but I don't have no idea.

1:50:03.860 --> 1:50:06.800
 But I think for somebody who's very structured,

1:50:06.800 --> 1:50:08.600
 very regimented, very linear,

1:50:08.600 --> 1:50:12.060
 the anxiety comes from letting go of those linearities.

1:50:12.060 --> 1:50:14.080
 And for the person that's very creative,

1:50:14.080 --> 1:50:18.240
 the anxiety comes from trying to impose linearities, right?

1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:21.680
 The really creative artists or musician, they're,

1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:22.840
 they seem nuts.

1:50:22.840 --> 1:50:24.520
 They seem like they can't get their life together

1:50:24.520 --> 1:50:26.040
 because they can't.

1:50:26.040 --> 1:50:28.600
 And they, you know, we look at people who are kind of

1:50:28.600 --> 1:50:31.320
 pseudo Asperger's or Asperger's or some forms of autism

1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:33.120
 and they are so hyper linear,

1:50:33.120 --> 1:50:36.480
 but you take away those linearities and they freak out.

1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:39.080
 And that's kind of the essence of some of those syndromes.

1:50:39.080 --> 1:50:42.380
 So I think that the ability to toggle back and forth

1:50:42.380 --> 1:50:44.120
 between those states is what's remarkable.

1:50:44.120 --> 1:50:46.400
 I mean, because we're here and we're having this discussion,

1:50:46.400 --> 1:50:48.180
 I mean, Steve Jobs is a good example.

1:50:48.180 --> 1:50:49.980
 He probably the best example,

1:50:49.980 --> 1:50:52.680
 somebody who actually talked about his own process,

1:50:52.680 --> 1:50:54.880
 about the merging of art and science,

1:50:54.880 --> 1:50:57.800
 art and engineering, humanities and science.

1:50:57.800 --> 1:51:00.080
 Very few people can do that.

1:51:00.080 --> 1:51:03.240
 Well, you seem to have a capacity to do that.

1:51:03.240 --> 1:51:06.320
 Like you know poetry and you are AI guy,

1:51:06.320 --> 1:51:08.680
 like you, there's nothing linear about poetry

1:51:08.680 --> 1:51:09.760
 as far as I can tell.

1:51:09.760 --> 1:51:12.660
 I mean, I do wonder, just like we've been talking about,

1:51:12.660 --> 1:51:15.160
 if there's any ways to push that to its limits

1:51:15.160 --> 1:51:17.680
 to explore further.

1:51:17.680 --> 1:51:20.280
 I don't like leaning, this is why I'm bothered

1:51:20.280 --> 1:51:22.400
 there's not more science and psychedelics is,

1:51:22.400 --> 1:51:24.720
 I haven't done almost,

1:51:24.720 --> 1:51:29.720
 so I've eaten mushrooms a few times allegedly,

1:51:29.760 --> 1:51:31.720
 but that's it.

1:51:31.720 --> 1:51:33.500
 And the reason I don't do more,

1:51:33.500 --> 1:51:36.400
 the reason I haven't done DMT is because it's illegal

1:51:36.400 --> 1:51:39.480
 and it's like not well studied.

1:51:39.480 --> 1:51:42.480
 And I'm in those things,

1:51:42.480 --> 1:51:45.280
 I'm not usually at the cutting edge, but I'm very curious.

1:51:45.280 --> 1:51:49.480
 And it feels like there could be tools

1:51:49.480 --> 1:51:51.960
 to be discovered there, not for fun,

1:51:51.960 --> 1:51:56.960
 not for recreation, but for like encouraging

1:51:57.320 --> 1:52:00.000
 whether you're a linear thinking to go nonlinear

1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:03.520
 or it's nonlinear to go linear, like to shake things up.

1:52:03.520 --> 1:52:05.060
 You mentioned Dan Gable,

1:52:05.060 --> 1:52:07.760
 the idea of Dan Gable on psychedelics is fascinating to me

1:52:07.760 --> 1:52:11.200
 because he's such a control freak.

1:52:11.200 --> 1:52:12.200
 I mean, he likes control.

1:52:12.200 --> 1:52:13.640
 That I would show up for.

1:52:13.640 --> 1:52:15.240
 That I would show up for.

1:52:15.240 --> 1:52:17.640
 But like so much of these psychedelic experiences

1:52:17.640 --> 1:52:19.840
 it feels like is for letting go.

1:52:19.840 --> 1:52:20.680
 That's right.

1:52:20.680 --> 1:52:21.500
 You don't wanna resist.

1:52:21.500 --> 1:52:23.920
 That's supposedly where the growth is

1:52:23.920 --> 1:52:27.520
 in giving oneself over to the process.

1:52:27.520 --> 1:52:31.360
 And that's for people who are like master controllers.

1:52:31.360 --> 1:52:33.140
 He's one of the greatest coaches of all time.

1:52:33.140 --> 1:52:35.760
 It's fascinating to see what that battle looks like

1:52:35.760 --> 1:52:38.680
 of resistance and then of letting go.

1:52:38.680 --> 1:52:43.680
 Yeah, I mean, I can't wait to see where these studies take us.

1:52:44.020 --> 1:52:45.560
 Well, it's clearly happening.

1:52:45.560 --> 1:52:46.440
 You know, I've asked there,

1:52:46.440 --> 1:52:47.680
 I have a couple of colleagues at Stanford

1:52:47.680 --> 1:52:49.360
 who are doing animal studies.

1:52:49.360 --> 1:52:51.460
 I've asked around, you know, it's,

1:52:51.460 --> 1:52:54.240
 there's a lot of discussion in the neuroscience community

1:52:54.240 --> 1:52:56.820
 about what the perception of a laboratory is

1:52:56.820 --> 1:52:59.480
 if they work on psychedelics.

1:52:59.480 --> 1:53:02.860
 I mean, I have to tip my hat to the folks at Hopkins.

1:53:02.860 --> 1:53:04.080
 They are pioneers.

1:53:04.080 --> 1:53:06.000
 And as Terry Signowski,

1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:08.600
 he's a computational neuroscientist down at Salk says,

1:53:08.600 --> 1:53:09.920
 I don't think he was the first person to say it.

1:53:09.920 --> 1:53:12.600
 He says, you know how to spot the pioneers?

1:53:12.600 --> 1:53:14.520
 They're the ones with the arrows in their backs.

1:53:14.520 --> 1:53:15.360
 Yeah.

1:53:15.360 --> 1:53:19.920
 And you know, it's an unkind world to a scientist

1:53:19.920 --> 1:53:22.020
 that's trying to do really cutting edge stuff.

1:53:22.020 --> 1:53:25.120
 My colleague, David Spiegel who studies medical hypnosis,

1:53:25.120 --> 1:53:28.720
 he's got dozens of studies now showing that hypnosis

1:53:28.720 --> 1:53:30.440
 can be beneficial for pain management,

1:53:30.440 --> 1:53:32.440
 anxiety management, cancer outcomes.

1:53:32.440 --> 1:53:34.280
 And it's finally, you know,

1:53:34.280 --> 1:53:36.920
 at the point where there's so much data,

1:53:36.920 --> 1:53:39.400
 but people hear hypnosis and they think of stage hypnosis,

1:53:39.400 --> 1:53:42.040
 which is like the furthest thing from what he's doing.

1:53:42.040 --> 1:53:45.720
 And I think mind, body type stuff,

1:53:45.720 --> 1:53:48.440
 hypnosis, respiration and breathing.

1:53:48.440 --> 1:53:52.560
 I think the hard science walk into the problem

1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:55.920
 is always going to be best to get the community on board.

1:53:55.920 --> 1:53:58.120
 And then it's up to people like Matt

1:53:58.120 --> 1:54:01.720
 and to really, you know, take it to the next level.

1:54:01.720 --> 1:54:03.800
 And as I say, not Keezy out of the game

1:54:03.800 --> 1:54:07.300
 because Keezy basically was taking too much of his own stuff

1:54:07.300 --> 1:54:09.400
 and he started dressing crazy of banana hats.

1:54:09.400 --> 1:54:11.720
 And like, you see him, he had the magic bus.

1:54:11.720 --> 1:54:14.320
 So, you know, the day I start driving to work

1:54:14.320 --> 1:54:17.640
 in the magic bus, that's the day I lose my job.

1:54:17.640 --> 1:54:21.000
 I'm not into buses or wearing fruit, but.

1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:22.320
 You're going to get a phone call from me

1:54:22.320 --> 1:54:23.600
 and I hope you do the same for me.

1:54:23.600 --> 1:54:26.680
 It's like, dude, what are you doing?

1:54:26.680 --> 1:54:28.040
 Well, what's interesting earlier,

1:54:28.040 --> 1:54:29.520
 we were talking about the challenge with David

1:54:29.520 --> 1:54:30.560
 that you're about to do.

1:54:30.560 --> 1:54:34.600
 I mean, that is a psychedelic experience of sorts

1:54:34.600 --> 1:54:36.240
 because you're biasing your mind

1:54:36.240 --> 1:54:38.720
 towards a pretty extreme neurochemical state.

1:54:38.720 --> 1:54:40.720
 And you don't know what you're going to find there.

1:54:40.720 --> 1:54:42.160
 And that's kind of the excitement,

1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:43.640
 at least for me as an observer.

1:54:43.640 --> 1:54:47.680
 It's like, I want to know what the experience

1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:49.520
 is like afterward.

1:54:49.520 --> 1:54:51.120
 I want to know like, how was it?

1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:52.720
 I mean, I'm sure you're going to get something.

1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:53.920
 Like you said, you're going to grow.

1:54:53.920 --> 1:54:54.860
 The question is how.

1:54:54.860 --> 1:54:55.820
 And not resisting.

1:54:55.820 --> 1:54:57.840
 I mean, it's the same as with the psychedelic experience.

1:54:57.840 --> 1:55:01.440
 It's like not like giving yourself over completely

1:55:01.440 --> 1:55:03.360
 to the experience and not resisting

1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:05.020
 and going through the whole mental journey

1:55:05.020 --> 1:55:08.720
 of whether it's anger or excitement or exhaustion,

1:55:08.720 --> 1:55:09.640
 the whole thing.

1:55:09.640 --> 1:55:14.640
 That's, I mean, that's the entirety of the process

1:55:16.600 --> 1:55:19.680
 that David goes through when he does his own challenges

1:55:19.680 --> 1:55:21.440
 and so on is that whole journey.

1:55:21.440 --> 1:55:26.440
 He finds purposely like missile seeks the limits

1:55:26.760 --> 1:55:30.600
 of the mind that whenever the resistance is felt,

1:55:30.600 --> 1:55:33.360
 runs up against it and then goes to the full journey

1:55:33.360 --> 1:55:35.760
 of going beyond it and seeing what's there

1:55:35.760 --> 1:55:36.600
 on the other side.

1:55:36.600 --> 1:55:38.080
 Well, stress has these two sides,

1:55:38.080 --> 1:55:40.120
 the limbic friction of being tired

1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:41.720
 and needing to get more energized.

1:55:41.720 --> 1:55:43.400
 That's one form of stress.

1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:45.640
 And then there's the feeling too amped up

1:55:45.640 --> 1:55:47.400
 and needing to calm down.

1:55:47.400 --> 1:55:50.160
 The typical discussion around stress is one thing,

1:55:50.160 --> 1:55:51.740
 but it's all limbic friction.

1:55:51.740 --> 1:55:53.600
 It's just that when I say limbic friction,

1:55:53.600 --> 1:55:54.900
 that's not a real scientific term.

1:55:54.900 --> 1:55:57.160
 I just mean the limbic system wanting to pull you down

1:55:57.160 --> 1:55:59.240
 into sleep or wanting to put you into panic

1:55:59.240 --> 1:56:01.720
 and you using top down processing,

1:56:01.720 --> 1:56:04.920
 using that evolved forebrain to say,

1:56:04.920 --> 1:56:06.880
 I'm not going to go to sleep

1:56:06.880 --> 1:56:09.120
 and I'm not going to freak out.

1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:11.840
 And those top down control mechanisms are,

1:56:11.840 --> 1:56:15.160
 I mean, when those get honed, that's beautiful

1:56:15.160 --> 1:56:18.660
 because then you're increasing capacity for everything.

1:56:20.880 --> 1:56:22.360
 This month on the podcast,

1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:23.760
 you're talking about neuroplasticity.

1:56:23.760 --> 1:56:25.260
 You mentioned a bunch already.

1:56:25.260 --> 1:56:29.040
 Is there something you're looking forward to specifically,

1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:31.920
 like something maybe you're fascinated by

1:56:31.920 --> 1:56:34.720
 that jumps to mind about neuroplasticity,

1:56:34.720 --> 1:56:37.620
 this fascinating property of the brain?

1:56:37.620 --> 1:56:39.560
 Yeah, I think that it's clear

1:56:39.560 --> 1:56:41.800
 there's one facet of neuroplasticity

1:56:41.800 --> 1:56:45.360
 that is very well supported by the research data

1:56:45.360 --> 1:56:48.760
 that hardly anyone has implemented in the real world.

1:56:48.760 --> 1:56:51.600
 And that's the release of acetylcholine from these neurons

1:56:51.600 --> 1:56:53.720
 in the forebrain called nucleus basalis.

1:56:53.720 --> 1:56:56.000
 This is mainly the work of Mike Merzenich,

1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:57.360
 who used to be at UCSF

1:56:57.360 --> 1:56:59.060
 and some of his scientific offspring,

1:56:59.060 --> 1:57:01.480
 Greg Reckensown and Michael Kilgard and others.

1:57:01.480 --> 1:57:04.820
 What they showed was increases in acetylcholine,

1:57:04.820 --> 1:57:07.560
 this molecule associated with focus,

1:57:07.560 --> 1:57:11.920
 in concert, meaning at the same time as some event,

1:57:11.920 --> 1:57:16.920
 motor event or music event or any kind of sensory event,

1:57:17.060 --> 1:57:20.540
 immediately reorganizes the neocortex

1:57:20.540 --> 1:57:22.800
 so that there's a permanent map representation

1:57:22.800 --> 1:57:23.980
 of that event.

1:57:23.980 --> 1:57:27.440
 And I absolutely believe that this can be channeled

1:57:27.440 --> 1:57:29.980
 toward accelerated skill learning.

1:57:29.980 --> 1:57:31.480
 And my friend and colleague, Eddie Chang,

1:57:31.480 --> 1:57:34.760
 who's now the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF,

1:57:34.760 --> 1:57:37.720
 but also a fine scientist in his own right,

1:57:37.720 --> 1:57:38.760
 not just a clinician,

1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:42.560
 he's doing studies looking at rapid acquisition of language

1:57:42.560 --> 1:57:43.680
 using these principles.

1:57:43.680 --> 1:57:45.760
 He trained with Merzenich.

1:57:45.760 --> 1:57:48.120
 It's clear we have these gates on plasticity

1:57:48.120 --> 1:57:48.960
 in the forebrain,

1:57:48.960 --> 1:57:53.720
 and they are gated by nicotinic acetylcholine transmission.

1:57:53.720 --> 1:57:56.880
 And why that hasn't made it into protocols

1:57:56.880 --> 1:57:59.520
 for motor learning, sport learning, language learning,

1:57:59.520 --> 1:58:02.480
 music learning, emotional learning, I don't know.

1:58:02.480 --> 1:58:05.520
 I think part of the reason has been kind of cultural

1:58:05.520 --> 1:58:07.840
 is that scientists publish their paper and they move on.

1:58:07.840 --> 1:58:11.000
 Merzenich talked a lot and still can be found

1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:13.080
 from time to time talking about

1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:16.560
 how these plasticity mechanisms can be leveraged.

1:58:16.560 --> 1:58:18.860
 But he had a commercial company,

1:58:18.860 --> 1:58:21.240
 and so then people kind of backed away from him a little bit.

1:58:21.240 --> 1:58:22.720
 I think he was, to be honest,

1:58:22.720 --> 1:58:25.240
 I think Merzenich was ahead of his time.

1:58:25.240 --> 1:58:27.320
 And I think the timing is right now

1:58:27.320 --> 1:58:30.360
 for people to understand these mechanisms of plasticity

1:58:30.360 --> 1:58:31.600
 and start to implement them.

1:58:31.600 --> 1:58:34.160
 Also, it all sounds like becoming superhuman

1:58:34.160 --> 1:58:37.080
 or optimizing or whatever, all that, yes.

1:58:37.080 --> 1:58:39.760
 But also what about kids with language learning deficits

1:58:39.760 --> 1:58:44.000
 or with dyslexia or just performance in school in general?

1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:46.200
 I have a deep, interesting concern

1:58:46.200 --> 1:58:48.480
 for the future of science and mathematics

1:58:48.480 --> 1:58:51.640
 and not just in this country, but all over the world.

1:58:51.640 --> 1:58:56.200
 And more plasticity equals faster, better, deeper learning.

1:58:56.200 --> 1:58:58.080
 And if we don't do this,

1:58:58.080 --> 1:59:00.520
 I don't think we're going to get the full reach

1:59:00.520 --> 1:59:03.000
 out of all the machine learning tools either,

1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:06.000
 because everyone talks about these huge data sets,

1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:09.480
 but those huge data sets funnel into human interpretation.

1:59:09.480 --> 1:59:12.380
 I mean, we don't just like stare at the numbers and bask.

1:59:12.380 --> 1:59:14.660
 So the human brain, I think,

1:59:14.660 --> 1:59:17.600
 needs to leverage these plasticity mechanisms

1:59:17.600 --> 1:59:20.240
 to keep up with the thing that's happening very, very fast,

1:59:20.240 --> 1:59:21.820
 which is technology development.

1:59:21.820 --> 1:59:24.080
 So that's a long winded way of saying

1:59:24.080 --> 1:59:27.000
 basal forebrain, cholinergic transmission and plasticity,

1:59:27.000 --> 1:59:29.080
 it allows for plasticity in adulthood

1:59:29.080 --> 1:59:33.360
 and it allows for single trial learning, which is incredible.

1:59:33.360 --> 1:59:34.920
 But how do we leverage that?

1:59:34.920 --> 1:59:38.160
 Like in the physical space taking actions

1:59:38.160 --> 1:59:41.160
 or is there some chemicals that can stimulate neuroplasticity?

1:59:44.440 --> 1:59:45.280
 Like what?

1:59:45.280 --> 1:59:46.720
 I think it's the intersection of the two.

1:59:46.720 --> 1:59:48.880
 I think it's being engaged in a physical practice

1:59:48.880 --> 1:59:51.000
 while enhancing pharmacology.

1:59:51.000 --> 1:59:52.260
 And it has to be done safely.

1:59:52.260 --> 1:59:54.120
 And this is full of open questions.

1:59:54.120 --> 1:59:56.600
 This is the very beginnings of it, like you're saying.

1:59:56.600 --> 1:59:58.960
 Yeah, a pill that's safe

1:59:58.960 --> 2:00:00.720
 that increases nicotinic transmission.

2:00:00.720 --> 2:00:03.000
 I mean, I know a number of people that chew Nicorette.

2:00:03.000 --> 2:00:05.560
 Actually, I have a Nobel prize winning colleague

2:00:05.560 --> 2:00:08.360
 at Columbia, not to be named,

2:00:08.360 --> 2:00:10.000
 who chews like six pieces of Nicorette

2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:11.880
 in a half hour conversation with him.

2:00:11.880 --> 2:00:14.960
 And he started doing that as a replacement for smoking

2:00:14.960 --> 2:00:18.180
 because smoking is nicotine nicotinic stimulation

2:00:18.180 --> 2:00:19.880
 of the cholinergic system.

2:00:19.880 --> 2:00:22.800
 So smokers have long known that increases focus

2:00:22.800 --> 2:00:24.120
 and attention and learning.

2:00:24.120 --> 2:00:27.120
 It's just that the lung cancer thing is a barrier.

2:00:27.120 --> 2:00:29.040
 Now I'm not suggesting people take Nicorette,

2:00:29.040 --> 2:00:32.760
 but it's clear that we need better directed pharmacology.

2:00:32.760 --> 2:00:34.720
 But you can imagine next time you go in

2:00:34.720 --> 2:00:37.440
 for a learning bout, if it's really essential,

2:00:37.440 --> 2:00:39.780
 you might want to stimulate the nicotinic system

2:00:39.780 --> 2:00:41.560
 if that's safe for you.

2:00:41.560 --> 2:00:42.520
 Again, I'm a doctor.

2:00:42.520 --> 2:00:44.160
 So again, I'm not telling people to do this,

2:00:44.160 --> 2:00:45.800
 but that's where it's going.

2:00:45.800 --> 2:00:47.480
 Until we start merging machines

2:00:47.480 --> 2:00:52.300
 with pharmacology and behavior, we're just kind of walking

2:00:52.300 --> 2:00:54.440
 around in the circle over and over again,

2:00:54.440 --> 2:00:56.320
 and it's going to happen.

2:00:56.320 --> 2:01:00.540
 Do you find computer vision, machine learning

2:01:01.400 --> 2:01:04.740
 from the perspective of tooling as an interesting tool

2:01:04.740 --> 2:01:08.840
 for analyzing, for processing all the data

2:01:08.840 --> 2:01:11.960
 from the neuroscience world, from the neurobiology,

2:01:11.960 --> 2:01:15.120
 biology, all the different data sets

2:01:15.120 --> 2:01:17.160
 that you could have about the mind, the eye,

2:01:17.160 --> 2:01:21.080
 the everything that's neck and above,

2:01:21.080 --> 2:01:23.480
 and also the central nervous system and all?

2:01:23.480 --> 2:01:24.720
 Absolutely.

2:01:24.720 --> 2:01:27.640
 I think that computer science and engineering

2:01:27.640 --> 2:01:32.040
 and chemistry, bioengineering, that's what's creating

2:01:32.040 --> 2:01:35.660
 the acceleration and progress in neuroscience right now.

2:01:35.660 --> 2:01:38.680
 I think it's actually one place where science,

2:01:38.680 --> 2:01:43.280
 I'm very reassured, science has invited in psychologists,

2:01:43.280 --> 2:01:46.080
 computational biologists, at least at Stanford, MIT,

2:01:46.080 --> 2:01:48.800
 and other places too, of course, it's clear

2:01:48.800 --> 2:01:53.120
 that it's a everyone's invited kind of party right now.

2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:55.880
 That the major issue in the field of neuroscience,

2:01:55.880 --> 2:01:57.160
 at least through my view,

2:01:57.160 --> 2:01:59.180
 is that there's no conceptual leadership.

2:01:59.180 --> 2:02:00.700
 No one is saying we need to work on

2:02:00.700 --> 2:02:02.760
 and solve this problem or that problem.

2:02:02.760 --> 2:02:05.720
 It's very fragmented right now.

2:02:05.720 --> 2:02:07.840
 Now, the good news is people are communicating.

2:02:07.840 --> 2:02:10.400
 So computer scientists and people who work on AI,

2:02:10.400 --> 2:02:13.640
 machine vision are talking to biologists and vice versa,

2:02:13.640 --> 2:02:15.640
 but it's very dispersed.

2:02:15.640 --> 2:02:18.920
 Is there a lot of different data sets in your work

2:02:18.920 --> 2:02:21.120
 that you've just come across?

2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:23.760
 Is there a huge number of disparate data sets

2:02:23.760 --> 2:02:26.320
 around neuroscience and so on?

2:02:26.320 --> 2:02:28.120
 Well, there's a lot of cell sequencing stuff.

2:02:28.120 --> 2:02:32.520
 So the Broad over in Boston and then on this coast,

2:02:32.520 --> 2:02:34.280
 the Chen Zuckerberg Initiative,

2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:40.840
 they did $3 billion to sequence every cell type

2:02:40.840 --> 2:02:43.920
 in humans and in animals and I think their goal

2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:47.080
 is to cure every disease by some date,

2:02:47.080 --> 2:02:48.800
 I don't know, in the future.

2:02:50.680 --> 2:02:54.560
 Huge data sets of gene expression and protein expression,

2:02:54.560 --> 2:02:55.760
 that's valuable.

2:02:55.760 --> 2:02:58.280
 I think no one really knows how to think

2:02:58.280 --> 2:03:02.920
 about neural circuits and what is a neural circuit?

2:03:02.920 --> 2:03:04.560
 Is it one structure?

2:03:04.560 --> 2:03:06.580
 Is it two structures communicating?

2:03:06.580 --> 2:03:08.840
 I think this is where I actually think

2:03:08.840 --> 2:03:13.640
 that the robotics is going to tell us how the brain works

2:03:13.640 --> 2:03:16.240
 because it's tempting to think that the brain

2:03:16.240 --> 2:03:18.660
 has all these cell types and circuits

2:03:18.660 --> 2:03:20.800
 in order to solve specific problems.

2:03:20.800 --> 2:03:23.120
 But it might be that the fundamental algorithm

2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:24.960
 is to create cells and circuits

2:03:24.960 --> 2:03:27.080
 that can solve variable problems.

2:03:27.080 --> 2:03:29.660
 We know in the retina, just a very simple example

2:03:29.660 --> 2:03:31.640
 is that we've always heard about like cones

2:03:31.640 --> 2:03:33.360
 are for color vision and high acuity

2:03:33.360 --> 2:03:37.520
 and rods are for night vision and non color vision.

2:03:37.520 --> 2:03:40.840
 But at the dusk, dawn transition,

2:03:40.840 --> 2:03:43.160
 certain cell types switch to do completely different,

2:03:43.160 --> 2:03:44.460
 have a completely different function

2:03:44.460 --> 2:03:45.520
 for viewing starry night

2:03:45.520 --> 2:03:47.960
 versus what they do during the daytime.

2:03:47.960 --> 2:03:50.120
 So neurons multiplex.

2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:53.860
 And I think building machines that can multiplex

2:03:53.860 --> 2:03:57.060
 and can evolve themselves is going to help us

2:03:57.060 --> 2:03:58.600
 really understand what the brain is doing.

2:03:58.600 --> 2:04:01.520
 We need to tease out the fundamental algorithms.

2:04:01.520 --> 2:04:03.260
 We know they're like motion detection

2:04:03.260 --> 2:04:05.160
 and spatial vision and things like that.

2:04:05.160 --> 2:04:07.420
 I think machines are going to be much faster at that

2:04:07.420 --> 2:04:11.040
 than our understanding of biology

2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:13.680
 and how the brain does that.

2:04:13.680 --> 2:04:15.120
 Basically, I'll be out of a job

2:04:15.120 --> 2:04:16.560
 and people like you will have a job.

2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:19.620
 Well, no, I think the main idea is that

2:04:19.620 --> 2:04:22.120
 there won't be a job that's machine learning

2:04:22.120 --> 2:04:24.000
 or computer vision.

2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:27.420
 It's just, it's a tool that neuroscientists

2:04:27.420 --> 2:04:29.400
 will use more and more and more

2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:31.920
 and biologists would use.

2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:35.320
 I mean, this whole idea that it will just be a tool

2:04:35.320 --> 2:04:39.240
 that allows you to start expanding

2:04:39.240 --> 2:04:41.840
 the kind of things you can study.

2:04:41.840 --> 2:04:43.520
 Well, the next generation coming up,

2:04:43.520 --> 2:04:45.200
 I can say this because I now I'm blessed

2:04:45.200 --> 2:04:46.880
 to have a bioengineering student.

2:04:46.880 --> 2:04:50.920
 They think about problems so differently than biologists do.

2:04:50.920 --> 2:04:52.440
 We realized the other day we both came up

2:04:52.440 --> 2:04:54.440
 with a set of ideas around a certain project

2:04:54.440 --> 2:04:56.360
 and we realized that her version of it

2:04:56.360 --> 2:04:58.420
 was the exact opposite of mine.

2:04:58.420 --> 2:05:00.280
 And hers was far more rational.

2:05:00.280 --> 2:05:01.680
 It's just an engineering perspective.

2:05:01.680 --> 2:05:03.600
 It's like, why would we do that last?

2:05:03.600 --> 2:05:04.920
 We should do that first.

2:05:04.920 --> 2:05:08.120
 I think that the next generation is really interested

2:05:08.120 --> 2:05:09.840
 in solving practical problems.

2:05:09.840 --> 2:05:12.120
 So a lot like computer science and engineering was

2:05:12.120 --> 2:05:13.860
 in the late nineties, it was like,

2:05:13.860 --> 2:05:16.360
 you can go do a PhD in computer science and engineering,

2:05:16.360 --> 2:05:18.280
 maybe, or you go work for a company

2:05:18.280 --> 2:05:20.220
 and actually build stuff that's useful.

2:05:20.220 --> 2:05:21.960
 I think neuroscientists and people interested

2:05:21.960 --> 2:05:23.820
 in neuroscience are starting to think,

2:05:23.820 --> 2:05:25.640
 how can I build stuff that's useful?

2:05:25.640 --> 2:05:27.920
 And this statement is supported by the fact

2:05:27.920 --> 2:05:32.040
 that many people in my business leave their academic labs,

2:05:32.040 --> 2:05:33.400
 fortunately not all of them,

2:05:33.400 --> 2:05:34.560
 but they leave their academic labs

2:05:34.560 --> 2:05:37.520
 and they go work for companies like Neuralink.

2:05:37.520 --> 2:05:42.520
 This is something I think we've spoken a few times offline

2:05:42.660 --> 2:05:47.320
 about, I mean, speaking of computer vision,

2:05:47.320 --> 2:05:48.840
 I'm fascinated by the eye.

2:05:48.840 --> 2:05:50.800
 I did a bunch of work on the eye.

2:05:50.800 --> 2:05:52.920
 So there's the neuroscientists,

2:05:52.920 --> 2:05:55.040
 there's a neurobiology way of studying the eye,

2:05:55.040 --> 2:05:57.960
 and there's the computer vision way of studying the eye.

2:05:57.960 --> 2:05:59.920
 And the computer vision way of studying the eye

2:05:59.920 --> 2:06:03.080
 of just like observing, noncontext sensing of humans

2:06:03.080 --> 2:06:04.360
 is really fascinating to me

2:06:04.360 --> 2:06:06.760
 and studying human behavior in different contexts,

2:06:06.760 --> 2:06:09.600
 like in semi autonomous vehicles,

2:06:09.600 --> 2:06:11.760
 it seemed like there's a lot of signal

2:06:11.760 --> 2:06:14.200
 that comes from the eye, that comes from blinking,

2:06:15.240 --> 2:06:16.960
 that's not fully understood yet.

2:06:16.960 --> 2:06:20.160
 It's been in the lab, it's been used quite a bit

2:06:20.160 --> 2:06:22.640
 to study like the dilation of the pupil,

2:06:22.640 --> 2:06:27.400
 all those kinds of things are used to infer workload,

2:06:27.400 --> 2:06:29.760
 cognitive load, all those kinds of things.

2:06:29.760 --> 2:06:32.600
 But the pictures is murky.

2:06:32.600 --> 2:06:34.400
 It's not completely well understood,

2:06:34.400 --> 2:06:36.840
 especially in the wild, how much signal you can get

2:06:36.840 --> 2:06:38.640
 from the eye, from the human face.

2:06:40.040 --> 2:06:43.960
 I've downloaded Joe Rogan's,

2:06:43.960 --> 2:06:46.140
 all of the podcasts he's ever done, video.

2:06:47.100 --> 2:06:49.000
 You have the YouTube bank.

2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:51.920
 I have the YouTube bank for a reason

2:06:51.920 --> 2:06:56.040
 that this was before he went with Spotify.

2:06:57.200 --> 2:06:58.200
 You own the archive.

2:06:58.200 --> 2:07:01.080
 There's PubMed, and then there's the Joe Rogan experience

2:07:01.080 --> 2:07:04.760
 owned by, or maintained by Lex.

2:07:04.760 --> 2:07:06.720
 For my private collection.

2:07:06.720 --> 2:07:08.440
 No, the reason I did it,

2:07:08.440 --> 2:07:11.280
 and I did a really rigorous processing of it,

2:07:11.280 --> 2:07:15.780
 which is like I extracted all of the faces,

2:07:15.780 --> 2:07:17.840
 I did the really good blink track,

2:07:17.840 --> 2:07:21.080
 the pupil tracking and the blink detection

2:07:21.080 --> 2:07:22.520
 for the entirety of the,

2:07:22.520 --> 2:07:25.000
 oh, I should say it's from episode like,

2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:28.240
 I forget what it is, but it's like episode 900

2:07:28.240 --> 2:07:31.360
 when they switched to 1080p video.

2:07:31.360 --> 2:07:33.480
 But it was like much crappier video.

2:07:33.480 --> 2:07:34.320
 It's still kind of.

2:07:34.320 --> 2:07:36.580
 Did you log when there was marijuana consumption

2:07:36.580 --> 2:07:38.760
 or when they were drinking?

2:07:38.760 --> 2:07:39.600
 I mean, there's so many.

2:07:39.600 --> 2:07:41.520
 Because that's gonna, like just,

2:07:41.520 --> 2:07:43.040
 it won't throw off the data,

2:07:43.040 --> 2:07:46.000
 but it's relevant to the pupil data.

2:07:47.560 --> 2:07:50.160
 So let's just put it this way.

2:07:50.160 --> 2:07:51.480
 There's a lot of fascinating

2:07:51.480 --> 2:07:53.160
 computer vision problems involved,

2:07:53.160 --> 2:07:57.120
 but I only kept long sequences of data

2:07:57.120 --> 2:08:00.380
 where the eyes detected exceptionally well.

2:08:00.380 --> 2:08:04.160
 And I also removed people that were wearing glasses.

2:08:04.160 --> 2:08:08.680
 I removed, there's certain people that have a way

2:08:08.680 --> 2:08:13.680
 of moving their eyes and squinting

2:08:14.080 --> 2:08:19.080
 where it's harder to infer like concrete blinks.

2:08:21.040 --> 2:08:24.920
 They'll kind of have a squint the whole time.

2:08:24.920 --> 2:08:27.560
 And their blink is very light.

2:08:27.560 --> 2:08:32.500
 It's very tough to know what's an actual blink.

2:08:32.500 --> 2:08:33.340
 So I wanted to.

2:08:33.340 --> 2:08:35.480
 Then you got those baseball cap wearing guys.

2:08:35.480 --> 2:08:37.000
 There are certain people that go on podcasts

2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:39.840
 and wear baseball caps and don't reveal their,

2:08:39.840 --> 2:08:42.360
 I don't know if they realize it or not until it comes out,

2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:45.680
 but their face is completely obscured from vision.

2:08:45.680 --> 2:08:47.820
 And from a computer vision perspective,

2:08:47.820 --> 2:08:51.320
 people that wear makeup and usually women on their eyes,

2:08:51.320 --> 2:08:52.680
 it complicates things.

2:08:52.680 --> 2:08:54.800
 Like eyelashes all complicate things.

2:08:54.800 --> 2:08:57.200
 So you can clean stuff up

2:08:57.200 --> 2:08:59.380
 just so you have really crisp signal.

2:08:59.380 --> 2:09:02.200
 You don't have to, you can deal with issues,

2:09:02.200 --> 2:09:04.960
 but there's so many hours of Joe Rogan video.

2:09:04.960 --> 2:09:08.360
 Anyway, I say all that because I was searching

2:09:08.360 --> 2:09:11.600
 for an interesting personal experiment for me

2:09:11.600 --> 2:09:15.520
 because I saw in drivers when I was looking

2:09:15.520 --> 2:09:19.280
 at eye movement in drivers, it seemed to indicate,

2:09:19.280 --> 2:09:21.640
 there seemed to be quite a lot of signal there

2:09:21.640 --> 2:09:25.560
 that indicates amount of cognitive load,

2:09:25.560 --> 2:09:28.840
 but it's not clear if there's something conclusive,

2:09:28.840 --> 2:09:31.920
 but if there is some signal, that's a really powerful one

2:09:31.920 --> 2:09:35.260
 because eye movement can be detected in the wild.

2:09:35.260 --> 2:09:36.480
 Like you and I sitting here,

2:09:36.480 --> 2:09:38.400
 I can detect eye movement really well.

2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:41.400
 Pupil dilation is a really crappy indicator.

2:09:41.400 --> 2:09:42.700
 And it's luminance dependent.

2:09:42.700 --> 2:09:45.920
 Like if I turn toward a light, it's a route.

2:09:45.920 --> 2:09:48.760
 People change size depending on level of alertness,

2:09:48.760 --> 2:09:49.920
 arouse autonomic arousal,

2:09:49.920 --> 2:09:51.920
 but also overall levels of luminance.

2:09:51.920 --> 2:09:54.960
 It's very, very hard, but there are,

2:09:54.960 --> 2:09:57.740
 I mean, you're sitting on a gold mine

2:09:57.740 --> 2:10:00.920
 because there is a lot of interest right now

2:10:00.920 --> 2:10:05.020
 in measuring state through noncontact sensing.

2:10:05.020 --> 2:10:07.720
 Heart rate variability through changes in skin tone,

2:10:07.720 --> 2:10:08.560
 just off a camera.

2:10:08.560 --> 2:10:10.260
 Can you imagine that at the point where

2:10:10.260 --> 2:10:11.560
 you just look at some video and you're like,

2:10:11.560 --> 2:10:13.680
 oh, they're getting more stressed or worked up

2:10:13.680 --> 2:10:15.200
 and they're not based on a heat map

2:10:15.200 --> 2:10:16.740
 of some little patch on their face.

2:10:16.740 --> 2:10:18.920
 Cause everyone's going to have this slight,

2:10:18.920 --> 2:10:21.000
 sort of compartmentalize it slightly differently,

2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:22.480
 but you can learn it pretty quickly.

2:10:22.480 --> 2:10:24.040
 We know this when someone's like giving a talk

2:10:24.040 --> 2:10:27.400
 and we see them starting to blotching on their neck.

2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:31.240
 This is like the thesis defense response, right?

2:10:31.240 --> 2:10:34.040
 We know it and it's a stressful situation

2:10:34.040 --> 2:10:37.560
 because not passing your thesis defense is rough.

2:10:37.560 --> 2:10:38.760
 And we can see that,

2:10:38.760 --> 2:10:40.800
 but cameras can pick that up really easily

2:10:40.800 --> 2:10:43.880
 at much lower levels than the blatant blotching

2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:44.720
 kind of effect.

2:10:44.720 --> 2:10:49.200
 And eye movements certainly are powerful indications

2:10:49.200 --> 2:10:51.600
 of the state of the autonomic system.

2:10:51.600 --> 2:10:55.600
 So do you think there are things from a high level

2:10:55.600 --> 2:10:58.800
 that you can pick up from eye movement and blinking?

2:10:58.800 --> 2:11:01.120
 Well, blink frequency is going to increase

2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:04.280
 as people get tired, right?

2:11:04.280 --> 2:11:06.320
 I've actually been teased a lot online

2:11:06.320 --> 2:11:08.680
 cause I don't blink much when I'll do a post.

2:11:08.680 --> 2:11:11.000
 And so I did a whole post about blinking,

2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:11.920
 about the science of blinking.

2:11:11.920 --> 2:11:14.880
 There's some data, very strong data, not from my lab

2:11:14.880 --> 2:11:16.680
 that show that every time you blink,

2:11:16.680 --> 2:11:18.400
 it resets your perception of time.

2:11:18.400 --> 2:11:20.280
 They have people do these kind of track

2:11:20.280 --> 2:11:22.480
 a kind of a Doppler like thing.

2:11:22.480 --> 2:11:25.320
 And anyway, blinking resets your perception of time.

2:11:25.320 --> 2:11:26.880
 There's a dopaminergic mechanism

2:11:26.880 --> 2:11:29.580
 in the blink related circuitry of the brain.

2:11:30.560 --> 2:11:31.400
 When people are very alert,

2:11:31.400 --> 2:11:32.520
 they tend to not blink very much.

2:11:32.520 --> 2:11:33.920
 When we're sleepy, we tend to blink more

2:11:33.920 --> 2:11:35.320
 and our eyes tend to close.

2:11:35.320 --> 2:11:37.040
 Now, some people are more hooded

2:11:37.040 --> 2:11:38.440
 in the way their eyes sit.

2:11:38.440 --> 2:11:40.640
 Some people are like this all the time.

2:11:40.640 --> 2:11:41.720
 There are some very famous people.

2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:42.560
 I'm not gonna name them

2:11:42.560 --> 2:11:44.840
 because I might run into them at some point

2:11:44.840 --> 2:11:47.040
 who were like accused of being sociopaths

2:11:47.040 --> 2:11:48.740
 cause they don't blink very often.

2:11:48.740 --> 2:11:51.040
 But they might just have high levels of autonomic arousal.

2:11:51.040 --> 2:11:53.340
 They just don't blink very much.

2:11:53.340 --> 2:11:54.980
 Also depends on how lubricated the eyes are.

2:11:54.980 --> 2:11:57.480
 So I think within individual,

2:11:57.480 --> 2:11:59.120
 you can get a lot of information.

2:11:59.120 --> 2:12:01.740
 I don't think we can say this person's blinking a lot.

2:12:01.740 --> 2:12:03.720
 They're lying, this person or they're tired.

2:12:03.720 --> 2:12:07.120
 This person doesn't blink, they're stressed.

2:12:07.120 --> 2:12:10.360
 I think if you understand that person's baseline,

2:12:10.360 --> 2:12:11.180
 you can get it.

2:12:11.180 --> 2:12:13.200
 And presumably, well, having been

2:12:13.200 --> 2:12:14.360
 on the Joe Rogan Experience,

2:12:14.360 --> 2:12:15.640
 I can say when you first sit down there,

2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:17.040
 if you've never been in there before.

2:12:17.040 --> 2:12:18.960
 You're in my data set by the way.

2:12:18.960 --> 2:12:19.800
 Oh my.

2:12:19.800 --> 2:12:22.420
 Well, I bet you I will admit to being,

2:12:22.420 --> 2:12:24.000
 first time sitting down there.

2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:25.720
 I mean, Joe was incredibly gracious,

2:12:25.720 --> 2:12:27.100
 made me feel very comfortable there.

2:12:27.100 --> 2:12:30.120
 But yeah, it's an intense experience.

2:12:30.120 --> 2:12:31.280
 It's a small space too.

2:12:31.280 --> 2:12:33.880
 Anytime you enter a small space from a big space

2:12:33.880 --> 2:12:38.060
 in his old studio, you're familiar with,

2:12:38.060 --> 2:12:39.200
 there's a breaking in period

2:12:39.200 --> 2:12:40.820
 where you're getting to know somebody.

2:12:40.820 --> 2:12:43.560
 And so I'm sure my levels of autonomic arousal

2:12:43.560 --> 2:12:46.160
 front of the podcast were higher than later.

2:12:46.160 --> 2:12:48.360
 But once you have a baseline established,

2:12:48.360 --> 2:12:52.800
 you can get a lot of data on somebody simply from blinks.

2:12:52.800 --> 2:12:54.780
 Some people averting gaze too.

2:12:54.780 --> 2:12:56.840
 If you have both people, that's really powerful.

2:12:56.840 --> 2:13:00.060
 This is the holy grail, another holy grail of neuroscience.

2:13:00.060 --> 2:13:03.000
 We've mainly looked at subjects in isolation.

2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:04.800
 There hasn't been much brain imaging

2:13:04.800 --> 2:13:06.720
 of two people interacting

2:13:06.720 --> 2:13:09.120
 or even in animal models of two mice

2:13:09.120 --> 2:13:10.400
 or two monkeys interacting.

2:13:10.400 --> 2:13:13.520
 It's all like person scanner, bite bar.

2:13:13.520 --> 2:13:14.800
 I mean, if you've ever been in one of these scanners,

2:13:14.800 --> 2:13:16.240
 you're like in a bite bar.

2:13:16.240 --> 2:13:17.640
 It's very medieval.

2:13:17.640 --> 2:13:19.640
 And so you think in the interaction,

2:13:19.640 --> 2:13:22.180
 there's actually, you can almost study them

2:13:22.180 --> 2:13:24.400
 as a single brain or as a single system.

2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:26.320
 The two brains are a single system.

2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:27.160
 I think with AI.

2:13:27.160 --> 2:13:28.000
 Highly correlated.

2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:30.720
 Yeah, maybe are your blinks triggering my blinks?

2:13:30.720 --> 2:13:35.240
 Are your non blink epochs extending my non blink epochs?

2:13:35.240 --> 2:13:38.100
 There's a fascinating space to explore there

2:13:38.100 --> 2:13:39.200
 and no one's done it.

2:13:39.200 --> 2:13:43.760
 And because everyone let the Joe Rogan experience archive

2:13:43.760 --> 2:13:45.280
 disappear, except for you.

2:13:45.280 --> 2:13:47.160
 You grabbed, did you get the comments too?

2:13:47.160 --> 2:13:49.680
 Because I think the comments were almost as entertaining

2:13:49.680 --> 2:13:50.680
 as the conversation.

2:13:50.680 --> 2:13:53.080
 You know what you just made me realize with the couplings,

2:13:53.080 --> 2:13:55.560
 I have a better data set than the Joe Rogan podcast

2:13:55.560 --> 2:13:56.960
 with high resolution video,

2:13:56.960 --> 2:13:59.580
 which is the raw video for this podcast.

2:13:59.580 --> 2:14:02.540
 So for example, both cameras right now are recording

2:14:02.540 --> 2:14:05.440
 you and I full feed.

2:14:05.440 --> 2:14:07.720
 The final result will switch cameras back and forth,

2:14:07.720 --> 2:14:09.640
 but I have the full feed.

2:14:09.640 --> 2:14:11.900
 So I can have the blinking for both you and I

2:14:11.900 --> 2:14:12.740
 the whole time.

2:14:12.740 --> 2:14:16.360
 I bet you people trigger blinks and in one another,

2:14:16.360 --> 2:14:19.300
 you know, and there's also like the simplest way

2:14:19.300 --> 2:14:21.560
 to think about the blinks and the attentional thing

2:14:21.560 --> 2:14:25.520
 and the alertness is two fighters in the standoff.

2:14:25.520 --> 2:14:28.200
 There's this whole lore around who blinks first.

2:14:28.200 --> 2:14:29.120
 It's like they blink first.

2:14:29.120 --> 2:14:30.800
 Well, what are we really asking?

2:14:30.800 --> 2:14:35.120
 They're asking whether or not one person can maintain focus

2:14:35.120 --> 2:14:36.720
 longer than the other person,

2:14:36.720 --> 2:14:39.440
 which is an important parameter.

2:14:39.440 --> 2:14:40.600
 It's not the only parameter,

2:14:40.600 --> 2:14:42.680
 but it's an important parameter.

2:14:42.680 --> 2:14:44.100
 And so that blinking contest,

2:14:44.100 --> 2:14:46.700
 even though they don't square off as a blinking contest,

2:14:46.700 --> 2:14:48.960
 it's well known that the first to blink

2:14:48.960 --> 2:14:51.280
 is revealing something about their capacity

2:14:51.280 --> 2:14:52.580
 to hold attention.

2:14:53.540 --> 2:14:56.120
 You've started an amazing podcast

2:14:56.120 --> 2:14:57.980
 that we've mentioned a few times.

2:14:57.980 --> 2:14:59.840
 People should definitely check it out.

2:14:59.840 --> 2:15:02.540
 It's called the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:15:02.540 --> 2:15:07.060
 It does your, it's basically,

2:15:07.060 --> 2:15:10.960
 it embodies the personality of Andrew Huberman,

2:15:10.960 --> 2:15:14.320
 which is like make science accessible,

2:15:15.760 --> 2:15:20.760
 but also fascinating and giving it,

2:15:21.880 --> 2:15:23.520
 like what do you call it?

2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:25.760
 You give tools for everyday life,

2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:28.940
 meaning it kind of grounds it like,

2:15:28.940 --> 2:15:32.160
 what the hell does this mean for my life?

2:15:32.160 --> 2:15:35.360
 But then also does the beauty of science at the same time.

2:15:35.360 --> 2:15:39.880
 So I love both the rigor and the openness

2:15:39.880 --> 2:15:40.720
 of the whole thing,

2:15:40.720 --> 2:15:42.840
 plus the whole corrections things that we mentioned.

2:15:42.840 --> 2:15:47.520
 Anyway, what's been the hardest part of this whole process?

2:15:47.520 --> 2:15:52.420
 You're one of, already one of the only,

2:15:52.420 --> 2:15:56.540
 and one of the best science broadcasters out there.

2:15:56.540 --> 2:15:59.800
 So in that process, what's been the hardest,

2:15:59.800 --> 2:16:01.480
 what's been the most exciting part?

2:16:01.480 --> 2:16:02.960
 Wow, well, first of all,

2:16:02.960 --> 2:16:05.520
 thanks for the kind words about the podcast.

2:16:05.520 --> 2:16:07.080
 It was inspired by you.

2:16:07.080 --> 2:16:11.540
 I absolutely, that's no BS.

2:16:11.540 --> 2:16:14.760
 The last time we met to do an interview for your podcast,

2:16:14.760 --> 2:16:15.800
 we talked a little bit about it

2:16:15.800 --> 2:16:19.360
 and you gave me the subtle nudge

2:16:19.360 --> 2:16:21.720
 that maybe there was a podcast there

2:16:21.720 --> 2:16:23.000
 and I thought about it and I laughed

2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:24.760
 and I was just like, I gotta do this thing.

2:16:24.760 --> 2:16:26.840
 And you really gave me the encouragement to do it.

2:16:26.840 --> 2:16:30.260
 And your podcast, this podcast has really forged the way.

2:16:30.260 --> 2:16:34.840
 You've been tip of the spear on serious scientific,

2:16:34.840 --> 2:16:37.600
 intellectual, yet fun, accessible conversation.

2:16:37.600 --> 2:16:42.600
 And so I, as your colleague and friend,

2:16:42.680 --> 2:16:45.480
 but just even if those things weren't true,

2:16:45.480 --> 2:16:48.560
 like this podcast was and is the inspiration.

2:16:48.560 --> 2:16:49.400
 There's no question.

2:16:49.400 --> 2:16:50.220
 Thank you so much.

2:16:50.220 --> 2:16:52.040
 Yeah, I really, like 100%.

2:16:52.040 --> 2:16:55.000
 And when I decided to do the podcast,

2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:56.400
 the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:16:56.400 --> 2:16:58.940
 I thought really long and hard about what would work best

2:16:58.940 --> 2:17:00.320
 and would be most beneficial.

2:17:00.320 --> 2:17:02.120
 It turned out to be the hardest thing,

2:17:02.120 --> 2:17:04.440
 which is to stay on a single topic

2:17:04.440 --> 2:17:06.600
 for three or four or more episodes

2:17:06.600 --> 2:17:08.680
 before switching to a new topic.

2:17:08.680 --> 2:17:12.920
 Because I know from the experience of university

2:17:12.920 --> 2:17:16.440
 and teaching in university, as you know as well,

2:17:16.440 --> 2:17:19.400
 that there's always the temptation

2:17:19.400 --> 2:17:20.760
 to pivot to something else,

2:17:20.760 --> 2:17:23.540
 but the drilling into something really deeply

2:17:23.540 --> 2:17:25.860
 is where the gems reside.

2:17:25.860 --> 2:17:29.580
 And the challenge has been how to make it interesting,

2:17:29.580 --> 2:17:31.280
 how to keep people on board,

2:17:31.280 --> 2:17:33.540
 how to give people tools along the way,

2:17:34.480 --> 2:17:37.680
 but also stay close to the scientific data.

2:17:37.680 --> 2:17:39.720
 I like to think that we're headed in the right direction.

2:17:39.720 --> 2:17:43.960
 It still needs to evolve, but that's been a challenge.

2:17:43.960 --> 2:17:47.780
 I think I also am challenged by the fact

2:17:47.780 --> 2:17:50.800
 that there's a tremendous range of backgrounds of listeners.

2:17:50.800 --> 2:17:53.520
 So some people have asked for more names,

2:17:53.520 --> 2:17:55.720
 like more bits and parts of the nervous system

2:17:55.720 --> 2:17:57.600
 and cellular molecular mechanisms

2:17:57.600 --> 2:17:58.480
 and all that kind of thing.

2:17:58.480 --> 2:17:59.380
 And other people have said,

2:17:59.380 --> 2:18:00.960
 I don't understand any of that stuff,

2:18:00.960 --> 2:18:02.240
 but I think I'm keeping up.

2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:04.120
 And so unlike a university course

2:18:04.120 --> 2:18:05.300
 where there are prerequisites

2:18:05.300 --> 2:18:06.680
 and everyone's coming to the table

2:18:06.680 --> 2:18:08.400
 with more or less the same knowledge,

2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:10.920
 I have a very limited sense of what the audience knows

2:18:10.920 --> 2:18:11.960
 and doesn't know.

2:18:11.960 --> 2:18:13.580
 So that's why I incorporated the feature

2:18:13.580 --> 2:18:15.840
 of the comment section on YouTube,

2:18:15.840 --> 2:18:18.120
 being a source of feedback.

2:18:18.120 --> 2:18:21.920
 And I do kind of an office hours like episode

2:18:21.920 --> 2:18:23.220
 every third or fourth episode

2:18:23.220 --> 2:18:25.520
 where I address common questions.

2:18:25.520 --> 2:18:29.140
 And I think that the podcast space in my mind,

2:18:29.140 --> 2:18:31.600
 at least for the sort of podcasts I'm doing,

2:18:31.600 --> 2:18:34.520
 needed a venue for the listeners

2:18:34.520 --> 2:18:37.280
 to be a more integral part of the experience

2:18:37.280 --> 2:18:38.860
 as opposed to just commenting

2:18:38.860 --> 2:18:40.540
 on what they liked or didn't like.

2:18:40.540 --> 2:18:42.680
 So while I like to hear what people liked and didn't like,

2:18:42.680 --> 2:18:44.160
 I also really like to hear about,

2:18:44.160 --> 2:18:46.960
 hey, tell me more about temperature minimums

2:18:46.960 --> 2:18:48.240
 and how they can be used to phase shifts

2:18:48.240 --> 2:18:50.240
 or cadient rhythms or whatever it is.

2:18:50.240 --> 2:18:51.960
 And I realized that I'm probably losing

2:18:51.960 --> 2:18:52.920
 some people along the way,

2:18:52.920 --> 2:18:56.280
 but hopefully at the end of each month,

2:18:56.280 --> 2:18:59.040
 and because of the way that the episodes are archived,

2:18:59.040 --> 2:19:01.920
 people will come away feeling as if they've learned a ton

2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:03.760
 and they have tools that they can implement.

2:19:03.760 --> 2:19:04.960
 And perhaps most importantly,

2:19:04.960 --> 2:19:07.640
 that they're starting to think scientifically

2:19:07.640 --> 2:19:10.760
 about the tons of other stuff that's out there.

2:19:10.760 --> 2:19:13.600
 So that's been the challenge and it's still really early

2:19:13.600 --> 2:19:16.800
 days, but, and of course,

2:19:16.800 --> 2:19:18.200
 there's also an intentional challenge.

2:19:18.200 --> 2:19:19.440
 I realize that people are busy.

2:19:19.440 --> 2:19:22.200
 Not everyone has two hours to listen to a podcast

2:19:22.200 --> 2:19:25.560
 about jet lag and shift work and raising kids

2:19:25.560 --> 2:19:27.120
 and sleep and that kind of thing.

2:19:27.120 --> 2:19:27.960
 I'm not raising kids,

2:19:27.960 --> 2:19:30.360
 but I did a whole thing about babies and sleep with,

2:19:30.360 --> 2:19:32.480
 you know, and how parents can manage their sleep

2:19:32.480 --> 2:19:33.900
 when kids aren't sleeping.

2:19:33.900 --> 2:19:37.640
 So it's been, I'm hacking through the jungle

2:19:37.640 --> 2:19:41.440
 of all this stuff, but, and I'll come right back to it.

2:19:41.440 --> 2:19:46.440
 My inspiration and my North star on this is getting

2:19:46.440 --> 2:19:51.440
 to a point where the audience that listens to this feels

2:19:53.860 --> 2:19:56.420
 the same way that I do when I listen to your podcast.

2:19:56.420 --> 2:19:57.260
 Thank you so much.

2:19:57.260 --> 2:19:58.940
 Like when I turn into your podcast,

2:19:58.940 --> 2:20:00.080
 I'm going to embarrass you a little bit more

2:20:00.080 --> 2:20:01.980
 by complimenting you a little bit more,

2:20:02.980 --> 2:20:05.620
 but not out of a sadistic thing,

2:20:05.620 --> 2:20:08.160
 but just because when I tune into your podcast

2:20:08.160 --> 2:20:11.140
 or Joe's podcast, I have the same sensation

2:20:11.140 --> 2:20:11.980
 that other people have.

2:20:11.980 --> 2:20:15.500
 Like, I feel like I'm home of sorts.

2:20:15.500 --> 2:20:17.300
 I'm like, I'm familiar with the space

2:20:17.300 --> 2:20:20.420
 and I'd like people to feel comfortable in the space

2:20:20.420 --> 2:20:21.620
 that is the Huber and Lab Podcast,

2:20:21.620 --> 2:20:23.300
 whatever that ends up being.

2:20:23.300 --> 2:20:25.820
 Yeah, that's the magic of podcasting.

2:20:25.820 --> 2:20:28.060
 It's like, I feel like I'm part of your life now

2:20:28.060 --> 2:20:32.280
 in a way that, as a fan, that I wouldn't be otherwise.

2:20:32.280 --> 2:20:35.660
 And, you know, like I never was able to have that

2:20:35.660 --> 2:20:37.860
 with Carl Sagan, for example, you know?

2:20:38.860 --> 2:20:42.180
 And that's a whole nother level of connection

2:20:42.180 --> 2:20:44.300
 with a human being that gets you excited.

2:20:44.300 --> 2:20:46.260
 And then I share your excitement

2:20:46.260 --> 2:20:49.900
 about different topics in neuroscience

2:20:49.900 --> 2:20:54.740
 or just biology in general.

2:20:54.740 --> 2:20:56.860
 And then I don't have to actually understand

2:20:56.860 --> 2:21:00.860
 everything you're saying to really enjoy it.

2:21:00.860 --> 2:21:03.700
 So that's the magic of podcasting is like,

2:21:03.700 --> 2:21:05.620
 you can go through like 10 minutes

2:21:05.620 --> 2:21:08.320
 and not understanding what the hell a person is saying,

2:21:08.320 --> 2:21:11.540
 and then you enjoy the excitement

2:21:11.540 --> 2:21:12.980
 and then you reconnect to a thing

2:21:12.980 --> 2:21:15.340
 that you do understand what they're saying.

2:21:15.340 --> 2:21:19.920
 And, you know, that's, that personal coupled

2:21:19.920 --> 2:21:22.580
 with the scientific rigor is magic.

2:21:22.580 --> 2:21:24.940
 And finding the right, it's exploration.

2:21:24.940 --> 2:21:27.700
 Like Joe found something that works for comedians,

2:21:27.700 --> 2:21:30.980
 which is like, you know, having a good laugh,

2:21:30.980 --> 2:21:34.060
 but also every once in a while talking seriously

2:21:34.060 --> 2:21:35.440
 about difficult topics.

2:21:36.380 --> 2:21:40.280
 The scientific space, it was unclear.

2:21:40.280 --> 2:21:41.700
 You haven't had guests on.

2:21:41.700 --> 2:21:45.060
 Not yet, but maybe you'll come on as our first guest.

2:21:45.060 --> 2:21:46.060
 I was gonna invite my,

2:21:46.060 --> 2:21:48.180
 I was gonna try to force myself in there.

2:21:48.180 --> 2:21:50.220
 I am, I'm officially inviting you now.

2:21:50.220 --> 2:21:51.140
 Will you come on the podcast?

2:21:51.140 --> 2:21:53.260
 I would love to, I would love to.

2:21:53.260 --> 2:21:55.660
 But it was hard.

2:21:55.660 --> 2:21:58.660
 It's still a little bit difficult to tell people

2:21:59.580 --> 2:22:01.060
 that no, you don't get it.

2:22:01.060 --> 2:22:03.900
 We're not gonna talk for 10 minutes.

2:22:03.900 --> 2:22:07.300
 We're gonna talk for three or four hours.

2:22:07.300 --> 2:22:09.020
 It's a different, for scientists,

2:22:09.020 --> 2:22:12.340
 for like, they're like, what are we gonna talk about?

2:22:12.340 --> 2:22:14.180
 They think it's like the NPR interview.

2:22:14.180 --> 2:22:15.020
 Yes.

2:22:15.020 --> 2:22:18.460
 And they don't realize, first of all,

2:22:18.460 --> 2:22:20.820
 I think at his best, if you're like at the level

2:22:20.820 --> 2:22:24.180
 of Joe Rogan, who I think is an excellent conversationalist,

2:22:26.060 --> 2:22:27.500
 you just lose track of time.

2:22:27.500 --> 2:22:29.140
 It can be three, four, five hours

2:22:29.140 --> 2:22:30.340
 and you lose track of time.

2:22:30.340 --> 2:22:31.860
 I'm still not there.

2:22:31.860 --> 2:22:34.100
 I find that it's still painful.

2:22:34.100 --> 2:22:36.940
 Like the conversation is still challenging sometimes.

2:22:36.940 --> 2:22:39.300
 You don't lose quite as much of track of time.

2:22:39.300 --> 2:22:40.740
 It's still an intellectual effort.

2:22:40.740 --> 2:22:43.380
 And I think it might always be as it would be with you

2:22:43.380 --> 2:22:45.780
 because you're talking about difficult topics,

2:22:45.780 --> 2:22:47.300
 maybe that require more brain.

2:22:47.300 --> 2:22:51.180
 You're not just shooting the shit with like a Brian Red Band

2:22:51.180 --> 2:22:53.500
 or somebody like comedians or just joking.

2:22:53.500 --> 2:22:55.300
 What's like, remember those shows,

2:22:56.300 --> 2:22:59.260
 like where those shows where someone would come out

2:22:59.260 --> 2:23:02.380
 and like spin plates and they're running back and forth.

2:23:02.380 --> 2:23:05.700
 Really good scientific discussion is like that.

2:23:05.700 --> 2:23:07.980
 You have to be maintaining three or four

2:23:07.980 --> 2:23:10.740
 different logical arguments and jumping back and forth.

2:23:10.740 --> 2:23:13.900
 It's occasionally get into like a real streak of linearity.

2:23:13.900 --> 2:23:17.260
 But as we found today that typically there's three

2:23:17.260 --> 2:23:18.620
 or four different things that we're bouncing back

2:23:18.620 --> 2:23:19.460
 and forth from.

2:23:19.460 --> 2:23:21.820
 And that requires a lot of updating of these,

2:23:21.820 --> 2:23:23.020
 you know, forebrain circuits.

2:23:23.020 --> 2:23:25.900
 It's not a passive listening experience.

2:23:25.900 --> 2:23:28.820
 But I like to think that the brain likes that.

2:23:28.820 --> 2:23:31.980
 I do want to ask just cause we all,

2:23:31.980 --> 2:23:36.180
 I don't want to forget the question came up to me

2:23:36.180 --> 2:23:40.460
 is your podcast has the same kind of rigor

2:23:40.460 --> 2:23:43.300
 that I think like a Dan Carlin podcast has

2:23:43.300 --> 2:23:45.060
 who's a history podcaster.

2:23:46.140 --> 2:23:47.900
 Well, that's a definitely a compliment.

2:23:47.900 --> 2:23:48.740
 Thank you.

2:23:48.740 --> 2:23:52.220
 Dan's way, you know, he's something for me to aspire to.

2:23:52.220 --> 2:23:54.420
 He goes through hell to prepare.

2:23:54.420 --> 2:23:56.260
 He spends months preparing.

2:23:56.260 --> 2:24:01.100
 It feels like you've had to really prepare for your podcast.

2:24:01.100 --> 2:24:02.940
 I definitely prepare hard.

2:24:02.940 --> 2:24:04.540
 How does that?

2:24:04.540 --> 2:24:05.460
 Are you okay?

2:24:06.580 --> 2:24:07.420
 Yeah.

2:24:07.420 --> 2:24:09.500
 I mean, how much effort does that take?

2:24:09.500 --> 2:24:11.540
 It feels like a conference presentation.

2:24:11.540 --> 2:24:12.380
 Yeah.

2:24:12.380 --> 2:24:15.300
 So we record once a week and in the intervening time,

2:24:15.300 --> 2:24:20.300
 I listened to many university level lectures.

2:24:21.380 --> 2:24:25.140
 So NIH has a bank of lectures.

2:24:25.140 --> 2:24:28.980
 I have some sources of recorded university seminars.

2:24:28.980 --> 2:24:32.020
 I'm trying to find the points of intersection.

2:24:32.020 --> 2:24:33.700
 So like for four episodes on sleep,

2:24:33.700 --> 2:24:36.580
 it's not like I'm going to just regurgitate a popular book

2:24:36.580 --> 2:24:39.380
 or take one lecture and just poach the content.

2:24:39.380 --> 2:24:43.500
 I'm going to find the overlap in the different elements.

2:24:43.500 --> 2:24:47.460
 I also, so what I'll do is I'll generally read 10

2:24:47.460 --> 2:24:51.060
 or 15 papers and generally those are good reviews,

2:24:51.060 --> 2:24:53.140
 annual reviews, any review of neuroscience,

2:24:53.140 --> 2:24:55.540
 annual review of physiology, those kinds of things.

2:24:55.540 --> 2:24:56.820
 I'll chase a few references.

2:24:56.820 --> 2:24:58.300
 I'll listen to some YouTube videos,

2:24:58.300 --> 2:25:00.460
 but of university level lectures.

2:25:00.460 --> 2:25:03.380
 And then I throw all that on a whiteboard.

2:25:03.380 --> 2:25:05.780
 Usually while I work out in the morning,

2:25:05.780 --> 2:25:06.860
 I'll just be working out.

2:25:06.860 --> 2:25:07.900
 I have a gym in my house

2:25:07.900 --> 2:25:10.260
 and I'll just put up all these random ideas.

2:25:10.260 --> 2:25:12.180
 I want to cover that dreams, hallucination.

2:25:12.180 --> 2:25:14.660
 And then I take that and I start to eliminate,

2:25:14.660 --> 2:25:17.180
 I draw lines between the common points of intersection.

2:25:17.180 --> 2:25:21.380
 And then from that, I distill out an outline.

2:25:21.380 --> 2:25:25.020
 And then I basically think about what I want to say

2:25:25.020 --> 2:25:27.220
 on my walks with my dog.

2:25:27.220 --> 2:25:29.260
 And I bother a couple of people and blab to them.

2:25:29.260 --> 2:25:31.140
 So I would say each podcast, yeah,

2:25:31.140 --> 2:25:33.180
 I put in 10 to 15 hours at least

2:25:33.180 --> 2:25:35.620
 of passive listening preparation

2:25:35.620 --> 2:25:38.700
 and maybe five or six of active preparation.

2:25:38.700 --> 2:25:40.900
 So I do prepare quite a lot,

2:25:40.900 --> 2:25:44.460
 but it has a certain reward component for me.

2:25:44.460 --> 2:25:46.100
 To come up at the end with something

2:25:46.100 --> 2:25:50.180
 that's somewhat crystallized for me is just so satisfying.

2:25:50.180 --> 2:25:52.860
 It feel like there's something about my dopamine circuits

2:25:52.860 --> 2:25:54.500
 that just love that.

2:25:54.500 --> 2:25:58.020
 And the only pain is that a year later

2:25:58.020 --> 2:26:00.140
 after I've talked about the stuff a bunch of times,

2:26:00.140 --> 2:26:04.220
 it's so much more succinct, but that's life.

2:26:04.220 --> 2:26:05.740
 At some point you got to pull the trigger.

2:26:05.740 --> 2:26:08.380
 Well, I don't know what you think,

2:26:08.380 --> 2:26:11.260
 but for me, YouTube is,

2:26:11.260 --> 2:26:13.380
 that's why I'm sad that Joe left YouTube.

2:26:13.380 --> 2:26:16.940
 There's a archival nature to YouTube that's kind of magical.

2:26:16.940 --> 2:26:18.660
 And so I'm really glad you're now,

2:26:18.660 --> 2:26:23.660
 you're doing a lot of educational content on Instagram

2:26:23.660 --> 2:26:25.380
 and Instagram before,

2:26:25.380 --> 2:26:29.140
 but now I'm doing this podcasting on YouTube.

2:26:29.140 --> 2:26:32.420
 It's like, you know, it's like Feynman lectures.

2:26:32.420 --> 2:26:35.860
 Like, I'm not saying every podcast,

2:26:35.860 --> 2:26:38.500
 but there will be, you will have some,

2:26:38.500 --> 2:26:42.340
 I could already tell there'll be some lectures

2:26:42.340 --> 2:26:47.340
 which are like definitive, like really special ones.

2:26:47.340 --> 2:26:48.180
 That's the hope.

2:26:48.180 --> 2:26:51.740
 And there's some aspect that's archival to YouTube

2:26:51.740 --> 2:26:54.860
 where at least I hope like 20 years from now,

2:26:54.860 --> 2:26:58.260
 some kid is gonna watch a lecture of yours

2:26:58.260 --> 2:27:02.860
 and it'll create the next Nobel prize, right?

2:27:02.860 --> 2:27:07.860
 It'll create another dream that then becomes a reality.

2:27:08.300 --> 2:27:12.580
 And then that's a special thing that YouTube provides.

2:27:12.580 --> 2:27:14.060
 So I'm really excited that you're on YouTube.

2:27:14.060 --> 2:27:15.540
 And at the same time,

2:27:15.540 --> 2:27:17.420
 I'm excited to see where this thing goes

2:27:17.420 --> 2:27:22.420
 because it seems like change is the cliche thing,

2:27:22.980 --> 2:27:25.300
 that change is the only constant in these times

2:27:25.300 --> 2:27:29.900
 because you're paving with this podcast,

2:27:29.900 --> 2:27:32.380
 with this creativity, what you were doing on Instagram

2:27:32.380 --> 2:27:34.900
 as well, you're paving the new era

2:27:34.900 --> 2:27:37.180
 of what it means to do science.

2:27:37.180 --> 2:27:39.460
 So actively doing research

2:27:39.460 --> 2:27:42.540
 and actively explaining that research in new media.

2:27:42.540 --> 2:27:44.740
 It's very interesting to see.

2:27:44.740 --> 2:27:47.500
 I'm genuinely inspired by you.

2:27:47.500 --> 2:27:49.140
 We had this discussion last time

2:27:49.140 --> 2:27:51.540
 after the podcast recording,

2:27:51.540 --> 2:27:54.620
 and it's clear that communication of science

2:27:54.620 --> 2:27:58.740
 cannot be left to the existing institutions.

2:27:58.740 --> 2:27:59.860
 And I'm not talking about universities.

2:27:59.860 --> 2:28:02.740
 I just mean that the science section of newspapers is,

2:28:03.740 --> 2:28:05.180
 sometimes there's some gems there,

2:28:05.180 --> 2:28:08.100
 but generally it goes, you know?

2:28:08.100 --> 2:28:11.420
 And I think you really have to know a field

2:28:11.420 --> 2:28:13.700
 in order to extract the best things from that field.

2:28:13.700 --> 2:28:16.740
 And my hope is that other practicing scientists

2:28:16.740 --> 2:28:19.060
 and people finishing their PhD and postdoc

2:28:19.060 --> 2:28:21.180
 and people who are running labs or working at companies

2:28:21.180 --> 2:28:22.220
 will start to do this.

2:28:22.220 --> 2:28:24.140
 I mean, how amazing would it be, for instance,

2:28:24.140 --> 2:28:29.140
 if someone at Neuralink was giving us hints

2:28:29.980 --> 2:28:31.980
 about not necessarily what they're developing

2:28:31.980 --> 2:28:34.340
 because that's complicated for all sorts of reasons,

2:28:34.340 --> 2:28:39.340
 but would talk to us about what the real challenges

2:28:39.900 --> 2:28:43.660
 of building futuristic brain machine interface are like

2:28:43.660 --> 2:28:47.020
 and what it means to understand a clinical problem

2:28:47.020 --> 2:28:47.860
 and address it.

2:28:47.860 --> 2:28:50.700
 I mean, my hope is somebody there might eventually do that,

2:28:50.700 --> 2:28:53.700
 that somebody in the world of chemistry

2:28:53.700 --> 2:28:55.940
 or synthetic materials or whatever it is

2:28:55.940 --> 2:28:57.780
 will do this in a way that I could understand

2:28:57.780 --> 2:28:59.900
 because I don't have expertise in those.

2:28:59.900 --> 2:29:02.260
 I think it would be marvelous.

2:29:02.260 --> 2:29:05.120
 And you were tip of the spear, you were out first,

2:29:05.120 --> 2:29:09.820
 and I'm just happily trying to move along

2:29:09.820 --> 2:29:10.760
 in the direction I'm going.

2:29:10.760 --> 2:29:14.120
 But I think the future of science education is online.

2:29:15.540 --> 2:29:17.380
 And I think that's gonna be scary

2:29:17.380 --> 2:29:19.380
 to a lot of existing institutions,

2:29:19.380 --> 2:29:21.540
 but it's not about disrupting anything.

2:29:21.540 --> 2:29:23.340
 It's just about trying to do things better.

2:29:23.340 --> 2:29:27.860
 Yeah, some of the best interviews,

2:29:28.720 --> 2:29:30.860
 some of the best investigative journalism

2:29:30.860 --> 2:29:33.620
 is done by people inside the field.

2:29:33.620 --> 2:29:36.080
 Comes to mind a guy by the name of Elon Musk,

2:29:36.080 --> 2:29:40.740
 who I love the possibility that he gets a Pulitzer

2:29:40.740 --> 2:29:41.900
 for that interview.

2:29:41.900 --> 2:29:44.100
 But he grilled the crap out of Vlad,

2:29:44.100 --> 2:29:46.380
 the CEO of Robinhood.

2:29:46.380 --> 2:29:47.220
 I'm not sure if you're familiar.

2:29:47.220 --> 2:29:50.340
 Oh, on Clubhouse the other night.

2:29:50.340 --> 2:29:51.860
 Yeah, I saw you guys in there.

2:29:51.860 --> 2:29:53.780
 I was kept out, I wasn't quick enough.

2:29:53.780 --> 2:29:55.300
 My thumbs don't go fast enough.

2:29:55.300 --> 2:29:57.500
 So I was, and I wasn't about to sit in the waiting room.

2:29:57.500 --> 2:29:58.860
 Have you tried that social network,

2:29:58.860 --> 2:29:59.860
 by the way, the Clubhouse?

2:29:59.860 --> 2:30:03.020
 I've gone in there a few times and checked some things out.

2:30:03.020 --> 2:30:05.060
 I'm there, I have a few questions about it

2:30:05.060 --> 2:30:07.920
 that like if I'm in there,

2:30:07.920 --> 2:30:11.660
 how one can participate or not participate.

2:30:11.660 --> 2:30:13.900
 I like being a fly on the wall for those conversations.

2:30:13.900 --> 2:30:15.740
 I've been very curious as to what's going on in there.

2:30:15.740 --> 2:30:18.620
 Oh, it's quite, I mean, I have a lot of thoughts.

2:30:18.620 --> 2:30:20.980
 Maybe it's useful to comment.

2:30:20.980 --> 2:30:23.380
 I also have a Discord server

2:30:23.380 --> 2:30:27.580
 that has a few tens of thousands of people on it.

2:30:27.580 --> 2:30:31.860
 And then they have also a voice chat capability.

2:30:31.860 --> 2:30:33.820
 So there's these get togethers.

2:30:33.820 --> 2:30:37.580
 And I was using it in the spring and summer,

2:30:37.580 --> 2:30:40.700
 like actively on those voice discussions.

2:30:40.700 --> 2:30:44.980
 And it's anywhere from 10 to like 1,000 people

2:30:44.980 --> 2:30:46.540
 all together in voice.

2:30:46.540 --> 2:30:49.180
 Like anyone can speak anytime, right?

2:30:49.180 --> 2:30:52.300
 But there's this weird dynamic that people stay quiet.

2:30:52.300 --> 2:30:54.140
 Only one person speaks at a time

2:30:54.140 --> 2:30:55.560
 because they're all like respectful.

2:30:55.560 --> 2:30:59.260
 And it's a community of like fundamentally

2:30:59.260 --> 2:31:01.860
 respectful people, even though they're all anonymous.

2:31:01.860 --> 2:31:04.940
 So like, except like me and a few others,

2:31:04.940 --> 2:31:06.260
 it's all anonymous people.

2:31:06.260 --> 2:31:08.300
 It's so interesting and it works.

2:31:08.300 --> 2:31:13.220
 But the magical thing to me about that community

2:31:14.220 --> 2:31:17.500
 was how intimate voice only communication can be.

2:31:18.540 --> 2:31:23.540
 It felt as intimate as like a small get together

2:31:24.720 --> 2:31:27.740
 at a home with close friends.

2:31:27.740 --> 2:31:29.900
 It felt like there's a calmness to it.

2:31:29.900 --> 2:31:33.700
 And you're revealing things about, you know,

2:31:33.700 --> 2:31:37.140
 somebody suffering from depression or being suicidal.

2:31:37.140 --> 2:31:39.700
 So those are the dark things or being super excited,

2:31:39.700 --> 2:31:42.140
 getting a new girlfriend or boyfriend.

2:31:42.140 --> 2:31:46.580
 Like just the depth of human experience shared on voice

2:31:46.580 --> 2:31:49.860
 without video is, I was really surprised

2:31:49.860 --> 2:31:52.060
 how intimate that is for human connection,

2:31:52.060 --> 2:31:54.460
 especially in this time of COVID, it replaced that.

2:31:54.460 --> 2:31:59.100
 So just to give you some context, there's something there.

2:31:59.100 --> 2:32:00.140
 There's definitely something there.

2:32:00.140 --> 2:32:03.100
 One thing that comes to mind is when like in Clubhouse,

2:32:03.100 --> 2:32:04.300
 you have your little icon.

2:32:04.300 --> 2:32:06.420
 So they don't actually, you don't see your face moving.

2:32:06.420 --> 2:32:08.800
 I think when people see their own image,

2:32:08.800 --> 2:32:11.540
 it puts them in a state of self consciousness

2:32:11.540 --> 2:32:15.620
 that is eliminated by just having an icon or an avatar.

2:32:15.620 --> 2:32:20.200
 So like Zoom is dreadful because if I'm not used

2:32:20.200 --> 2:32:22.440
 to talking to people and seeing a little image of myself

2:32:22.440 --> 2:32:24.300
 staring back at me in the mirror.

2:32:24.300 --> 2:32:26.580
 And it's just, I know there are ways

2:32:26.580 --> 2:32:29.180
 that you can adjust that, but it's really awful.

2:32:29.180 --> 2:32:31.620
 And I think that when I get on Zooms now,

2:32:31.620 --> 2:32:34.540
 I say hello and then I shut down the video component.

2:32:34.540 --> 2:32:35.660
 And then I just talk in the end.

2:32:35.660 --> 2:32:38.840
 I come back on just to show that still there, it's still me.

2:32:38.840 --> 2:32:42.140
 But I think that voice only is really interesting.

2:32:42.140 --> 2:32:43.860
 Eddie Chang would be an interesting person

2:32:43.860 --> 2:32:45.940
 to talk to about this because he understands so much

2:32:45.940 --> 2:32:48.300
 about how inflection communicates

2:32:48.300 --> 2:32:50.140
 emotionality in deeper state.

2:32:50.140 --> 2:32:52.740
 But there's a balance between, I think,

2:32:52.740 --> 2:32:54.780
 just like you said, this is the privacy

2:32:55.960 --> 2:32:59.100
 somehow allows for the intimacy.

2:32:59.100 --> 2:33:03.260
 So like being able to, as opposed to putting on an act,

2:33:03.260 --> 2:33:05.340
 which I realize we do when we're visually

2:33:05.340 --> 2:33:08.300
 presenting ourselves in remote communication.

2:33:08.300 --> 2:33:10.040
 But I think that there's so few places

2:33:10.040 --> 2:33:12.280
 where people can actually communicate

2:33:12.280 --> 2:33:14.300
 without the fear of penalty.

2:33:15.380 --> 2:33:19.280
 That's woefully absent these days.

2:33:19.280 --> 2:33:21.860
 And so maybe people are just relieved to be in a place

2:33:21.860 --> 2:33:24.120
 where they feel like I can say what I want

2:33:24.120 --> 2:33:26.460
 or not say anything and it's okay.

2:33:26.460 --> 2:33:30.140
 And so Clubhouse, to answer your kind of question is,

2:33:31.020 --> 2:33:33.180
 there was a big improvement to me over Discord,

2:33:33.180 --> 2:33:37.820
 which is it has tiers, it has a stage where people,

2:33:37.820 --> 2:33:40.340
 the person that created the room can invite people up

2:33:40.340 --> 2:33:42.660
 that would like to speak potentially,

2:33:42.660 --> 2:33:43.860
 have the opportunity to speak.

2:33:43.860 --> 2:33:45.940
 And then there's a bigger audience

2:33:45.940 --> 2:33:48.420
 that don't get a chance to speak unless they

2:33:48.420 --> 2:33:51.060
 click raise their hand and they get called on.

2:33:51.060 --> 2:33:54.580
 So there's like a tier system that allows

2:33:54.580 --> 2:33:59.260
 for there to be a group of like five, 10, 20, 30 people

2:33:59.260 --> 2:34:03.380
 talking and a lot larger amount in the audience,

2:34:03.380 --> 2:34:06.020
 which in Discord was the problems that everybody could talk.

2:34:06.020 --> 2:34:09.300
 And the other thing about Clubhouse is everybody

2:34:09.300 --> 2:34:11.600
 is strongly encouraged to represent themselves.

2:34:11.600 --> 2:34:14.980
 So you're using your real name, it's not anonymous.

2:34:14.980 --> 2:34:18.140
 And how many people were in that GameStop discussion

2:34:18.140 --> 2:34:18.980
 the other day?

2:34:18.980 --> 2:34:23.320
 They currently limit rooms to 5,000.

2:34:23.320 --> 2:34:25.260
 So I'm sure maxed out at 5,000.

2:34:25.260 --> 2:34:27.620
 There's a lot of overflow rooms.

2:34:27.620 --> 2:34:29.420
 This is the cool thing about Clubhouse,

2:34:29.420 --> 2:34:32.220
 really big people were on there all tuned in

2:34:32.220 --> 2:34:35.940
 and having a conversation, having all from,

2:34:35.940 --> 2:34:39.700
 all these different worlds being able to connect,

2:34:39.700 --> 2:34:42.640
 even though without the niceties of like arranging

2:34:42.640 --> 2:34:44.740
 the meeting, you could just show up and leave,

2:34:44.740 --> 2:34:45.820
 which is really nice.

2:34:45.820 --> 2:34:50.280
 But the reason for my lessons from Discord,

2:34:50.280 --> 2:34:54.080
 I'm going to mostly stay away from Clubhouse.

2:34:54.080 --> 2:34:56.100
 And I think.

2:34:56.100 --> 2:34:58.080
 Or go in there under another name.

2:34:58.080 --> 2:34:58.920
 Right.

2:35:00.160 --> 2:35:02.600
 I'll pretend I know the actual, your actual name.

2:35:02.600 --> 2:35:06.960
 Yeah, it's, I've learned, it's quite addicting.

2:35:06.960 --> 2:35:08.560
 It's a time sink.

2:35:08.560 --> 2:35:12.600
 It's so, the intimacy of it is you find yourself

2:35:12.600 --> 2:35:14.160
 wasting quite a bit of time on there.

2:35:14.160 --> 2:35:15.520
 It pulls you in.

2:35:15.520 --> 2:35:16.760
 Well, it's interesting.

2:35:16.760 --> 2:35:20.800
 They would in sort of going back to the podcast

2:35:20.800 --> 2:35:22.480
 or earlier, we're talking about books

2:35:22.480 --> 2:35:24.480
 or creating a technology.

2:35:24.480 --> 2:35:27.240
 One thing that's absolutely clear is that anything

2:35:27.240 --> 2:35:31.200
 that's easy to reproduce is probably not worth

2:35:31.200 --> 2:35:33.420
 much effort and time.

2:35:33.420 --> 2:35:34.260
 Yes.

2:35:34.260 --> 2:35:35.100
 Right?

2:35:35.100 --> 2:35:39.320
 I mean, most posts could be easily reproduced.

2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:40.280
 You just repost them.

2:35:40.280 --> 2:35:41.120
 Yeah.

2:35:41.120 --> 2:35:44.180
 So now there are some original posts that for which

2:35:44.180 --> 2:35:46.200
 the attribution goes to the original person

2:35:46.200 --> 2:35:48.000
 and it's clear it came from you.

2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:50.400
 But anything that can be easily reproduced is,

2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:53.660
 doesn't really expand us very much as individuals

2:35:53.660 --> 2:35:55.280
 or as groups.

2:35:55.280 --> 2:35:57.900
 And most of what I see on social media is stuff

2:35:57.900 --> 2:36:00.400
 that is purely reproduced.

2:36:00.400 --> 2:36:01.420
 Yes.

2:36:01.420 --> 2:36:05.840
 But I think Clubhouse, I mean, it could be

2:36:05.840 --> 2:36:08.200
 that some real magic emerges on there.

2:36:08.200 --> 2:36:10.220
 So in moderation could be good.

2:36:10.220 --> 2:36:13.840
 The magic is, this is another thing that I've found

2:36:13.840 --> 2:36:18.840
 through COVID that maybe you can think about is live.

2:36:20.400 --> 2:36:24.560
 I used to be, not understand the appeal of live video

2:36:24.560 --> 2:36:28.880
 or live connection or like in this Clubhouse live events.

2:36:28.880 --> 2:36:32.440
 Because Clubhouse is technically, for the most part,

2:36:32.440 --> 2:36:34.040
 it's not supposed to be recorded.

2:36:34.040 --> 2:36:36.520
 Most people don't record most conversations.

2:36:36.520 --> 2:36:38.560
 It's a one time live event.

2:36:38.560 --> 2:36:40.280
 And there's a magic to that.

2:36:40.280 --> 2:36:41.120
 There is.

2:36:41.120 --> 2:36:44.640
 That's not captured by like your podcast

2:36:44.640 --> 2:36:49.360
 or my podcast produced video that's like recorded,

2:36:49.360 --> 2:36:50.960
 like packaged up.

2:36:50.960 --> 2:36:52.420
 Well, anything can happen.

2:36:52.420 --> 2:36:54.200
 It's that anything can happen.

2:36:54.200 --> 2:36:57.400
 And that's the kind of thing like live concerts.

2:36:57.400 --> 2:37:00.440
 I definitely, I love live music.

2:37:00.440 --> 2:37:02.040
 And it's the idea that,

2:37:02.040 --> 2:37:03.440
 cause you can always listen to the album.

2:37:03.440 --> 2:37:05.840
 Actually the album usually sounds cleaner and better,

2:37:05.840 --> 2:37:08.300
 but it's just this idea that anything can happen.

2:37:08.300 --> 2:37:10.740
 And then you listen to like the parts, I don't know,

2:37:10.740 --> 2:37:13.800
 you like a Costello did something weird.

2:37:13.800 --> 2:37:15.200
 Your dog did something weird.

2:37:15.200 --> 2:37:17.040
 And then you have to go, God damn it.

2:37:17.040 --> 2:37:19.760
 You have to go to the kitchen or something to get something.

2:37:19.760 --> 2:37:22.280
 And then you come back and it's funny.

2:37:22.280 --> 2:37:24.640
 I watched live video like that of people

2:37:24.640 --> 2:37:26.400
 and I'll be there for the whole time.

2:37:26.400 --> 2:37:28.800
 I'll wait for them to go to the kitchen and come back.

2:37:28.800 --> 2:37:30.680
 It's not like I tune out.

2:37:30.680 --> 2:37:33.480
 And that makes it like a richer experience for some reason.

2:37:33.480 --> 2:37:34.320
 It's weird.

2:37:34.320 --> 2:37:35.400
 Well, it humanizes it.

2:37:35.400 --> 2:37:36.440
 Yeah, humanizes it.

2:37:36.440 --> 2:37:39.120
 And I think there is this weird effect of whether or not

2:37:39.120 --> 2:37:41.320
 it's a podcast, Instagram or Twitter or anything else.

2:37:41.320 --> 2:37:44.520
 There's kind of like two people shouting into a tunnel

2:37:44.520 --> 2:37:46.440
 and then a bunch of people with ears at the other end

2:37:46.440 --> 2:37:49.160
 of those tunnels and shouting some things back.

2:37:49.160 --> 2:37:52.080
 You know, that's kind of the format we're in.

2:37:52.080 --> 2:37:54.160
 I think I'll check out Clubhouse again.

2:37:54.160 --> 2:37:55.640
 I've gone in there a few times during the day

2:37:55.640 --> 2:37:57.480
 and I was surprised to see how many people were in there

2:37:57.480 --> 2:37:58.640
 in the middle of the day.

2:37:58.640 --> 2:38:01.400
 I was like, aren't these people supposed to be working?

2:38:01.400 --> 2:38:02.440
 But maybe that is their work.

2:38:02.440 --> 2:38:07.080
 Well, be very careful about the time sink of it.

2:38:07.080 --> 2:38:09.120
 But yeah, if you want to, you and I go together,

2:38:09.120 --> 2:38:10.800
 we'll have a conversation on there.

2:38:10.800 --> 2:38:13.360
 But one of the things you have to figure out,

2:38:13.360 --> 2:38:17.340
 I don't still know how to do it, but how to exit.

2:38:17.340 --> 2:38:18.180
 Which is like.

2:38:18.180 --> 2:38:20.320
 And you just do the, isn't there the leave quietly button?

2:38:20.320 --> 2:38:22.600
 Yeah, no, but like when you and I are on stage

2:38:22.600 --> 2:38:27.600
 having a conversation, okay, you and I is harder.

2:38:27.800 --> 2:38:31.240
 But like you really, if it's just you and I,

2:38:31.240 --> 2:38:33.740
 then it's the usual human communication of like,

2:38:33.740 --> 2:38:35.280
 all right, I gotta go.

2:38:35.280 --> 2:38:38.040
 Like, but when it's like four people,

2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:40.120
 you don't want to interrupt everyone

2:38:40.120 --> 2:38:41.000
 and announce you're leaving.

2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:43.180
 You just have to, I mean, there's a weird dynamic

2:38:43.180 --> 2:38:45.960
 that I haven't quite figured out of.

2:38:45.960 --> 2:38:47.160
 The etiquette isn't clear.

2:38:47.160 --> 2:38:48.320
 The etiquette is not clear.

2:38:48.320 --> 2:38:52.060
 Well, the etiquette on different platforms

2:38:52.060 --> 2:38:54.120
 and how that changes is really interesting.

2:38:54.120 --> 2:38:56.360
 You know, how YouTube has one etiquette,

2:38:56.360 --> 2:38:58.900
 which is kind of, it's a lot of harshness is tolerated

2:38:58.900 --> 2:39:01.280
 on YouTube video comments.

2:39:01.280 --> 2:39:04.000
 Twitter seems a bit harsher than Instagram.

2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:05.560
 Instagram, there's kind of, it seems to be a little.

2:39:05.560 --> 2:39:06.400
 People are nice.

2:39:06.400 --> 2:39:07.600
 People are really nice.

2:39:07.600 --> 2:39:10.440
 People are really nice on Instagram for the most part,

2:39:11.300 --> 2:39:13.580
 except for those phishing things.

2:39:13.580 --> 2:39:16.920
 I actually know someone who had their quite sizable account

2:39:16.920 --> 2:39:18.560
 poached by those copyright.

2:39:18.560 --> 2:39:19.760
 They come in with those like,

2:39:19.760 --> 2:39:21.800
 you violated copyright thing.

2:39:21.800 --> 2:39:23.520
 There's all sorts of harshness in there

2:39:23.520 --> 2:39:25.360
 that if you think about it in the real world,

2:39:25.360 --> 2:39:28.240
 I like to think about Instagram as if it was the real world.

2:39:28.240 --> 2:39:30.280
 Someone comes over and is basically saying like,

2:39:30.280 --> 2:39:32.520
 hey, can I hold your wallet and go into the bank

2:39:32.520 --> 2:39:33.660
 and I'll get some money out for you?

2:39:33.660 --> 2:39:35.400
 And like, but there's this trust

2:39:35.400 --> 2:39:37.260
 based on the format it comes in

2:39:37.260 --> 2:39:39.220
 that it can almost get past your radar

2:39:39.220 --> 2:39:40.960
 unless you're suspicious.

2:39:40.960 --> 2:39:43.520
 If you took comments, like, you know,

2:39:43.520 --> 2:39:45.480
 you're posting a lot of comments and you said,

2:39:45.480 --> 2:39:48.600
 you just walk past 500 random people on the street

2:39:48.600 --> 2:39:50.580
 and just listen to what they say,

2:39:50.580 --> 2:39:52.040
 it's like, that's ridiculous.

2:39:52.040 --> 2:39:53.560
 I don't have time for that.

2:39:53.560 --> 2:39:55.520
 But the comments somehow take on this importance

2:39:55.520 --> 2:39:56.820
 and this relevance.

2:39:56.820 --> 2:40:00.920
 And you feel, we feel obligated to give them value, right?

2:40:00.920 --> 2:40:03.840
 And so the online communities,

2:40:03.840 --> 2:40:05.760
 the rules really are different.

2:40:06.720 --> 2:40:08.200
 And they evolve with time, which is fascinating.

2:40:08.200 --> 2:40:10.020
 With Clubhouse, it's a new social network,

2:40:10.020 --> 2:40:13.800
 so it's evolving and people are figuring it out as you go.

2:40:13.800 --> 2:40:16.480
 And the same thing with podcasting on video

2:40:16.480 --> 2:40:18.200
 and like scientific podcasting.

2:40:18.200 --> 2:40:22.040
 This is the cool thing when I look at what you've created,

2:40:22.040 --> 2:40:23.800
 I'm learning, I'm thinking like,

2:40:23.800 --> 2:40:26.400
 hmm, that's interesting to do it this way.

2:40:26.400 --> 2:40:29.340
 Because like, I have nobody to copy.

2:40:29.340 --> 2:40:31.280
 Not many people to copy, you know what I mean?

2:40:31.280 --> 2:40:32.560
 Well, you threw out an idea.

2:40:32.560 --> 2:40:33.820
 I'm not gonna put it out here now,

2:40:33.820 --> 2:40:35.280
 cause I don't wanna,

2:40:35.280 --> 2:40:37.160
 cause knowing you, you'll hold yourself to it

2:40:37.160 --> 2:40:38.000
 no matter what.

2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:41.720
 But when we talked about this issue of the challenge

2:40:41.720 --> 2:40:43.920
 of staying on a particular topic for a while,

2:40:43.920 --> 2:40:46.200
 I mean, you do have some cool stuff brewing in there.

2:40:46.200 --> 2:40:47.040
 Oh, no, no, no.

2:40:47.040 --> 2:40:48.040
 That's separate from this format.

2:40:48.040 --> 2:40:49.920
 And I love your interview format,

2:40:49.920 --> 2:40:52.020
 but when you told me about that,

2:40:52.020 --> 2:40:54.000
 I got really excited that you might go forward.

2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:55.920
 I'm not gonna tell your audience what it is,

2:40:55.920 --> 2:40:58.660
 but I will say this, it is super cool.

2:40:58.660 --> 2:41:00.160
 I would have never thought about it.

2:41:00.160 --> 2:41:01.600
 It's distinctly different than what I'm doing

2:41:01.600 --> 2:41:03.280
 or what Lex is currently doing.

2:41:03.280 --> 2:41:07.440
 And if you decide to do that podcast,

2:41:07.440 --> 2:41:09.960
 I will be your first and your number one fan.

2:41:09.960 --> 2:41:12.080
 And I know there are gonna be millions of other people

2:41:12.080 --> 2:41:12.920
 interested in that.

2:41:12.920 --> 2:41:13.920
 It would be amazing.

2:41:13.920 --> 2:41:16.940
 So if you decide to go forward with the idea,

2:41:18.180 --> 2:41:19.280
 that would be awesome.

2:41:19.280 --> 2:41:20.220
 I was gonna say what it is,

2:41:20.220 --> 2:41:22.440
 but now I'm not going to because,

2:41:22.440 --> 2:41:24.000
 cause that's even more interesting.

2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:27.600
 I brought up the clubhouse thing actually in Elon,

2:41:27.600 --> 2:41:31.840
 because I just wanted to get your thoughts

2:41:31.840 --> 2:41:36.840
 about something he's said a few times to me and in general,

2:41:37.240 --> 2:41:40.040
 is that he's under a huge amount of stress.

2:41:40.040 --> 2:41:44.480
 And I'm thinking of doing a startup now

2:41:44.480 --> 2:41:47.960
 and kind of thinking about all of this.

2:41:47.960 --> 2:41:51.320
 Cause I enjoy podcasts, I enjoy science,

2:41:51.320 --> 2:41:56.000
 but he says that his life is basically hell.

2:41:56.000 --> 2:41:57.320
 It's very difficult.

2:41:57.320 --> 2:41:59.840
 He looks happy, but he's probably very good at.

2:41:59.840 --> 2:42:01.160
 He's fulfilled.

2:42:01.160 --> 2:42:04.240
 He's fulfilled, but the stress levels,

2:42:04.240 --> 2:42:08.480
 the constant fires that he has to put out.

2:42:08.480 --> 2:42:11.640
 And he says that most people wouldn't want to be me.

2:42:11.640 --> 2:42:16.160
 And that basically the reason he does what he does

2:42:16.160 --> 2:42:19.920
 is because there's probably something wrong with him.

2:42:19.920 --> 2:42:24.200
 Like it's not, he can't help it, but do that.

2:42:24.200 --> 2:42:29.080
 Kind of beautiful in a kind of Russian masochistic way.

2:42:29.080 --> 2:42:31.640
 Well, I just wonder the stress.

2:42:31.640 --> 2:42:35.440
 I mean, I'm sure you can imagine the kind of stress

2:42:35.440 --> 2:42:39.880
 he's under because, so it's running three plus companies

2:42:39.880 --> 2:42:44.880
 and there's constant, he says that every single meeting

2:42:45.840 --> 2:42:49.920
 is not about like, should we install a coffee maker

2:42:49.920 --> 2:42:51.760
 in the kitchen?

2:42:51.760 --> 2:42:56.240
 It's like, this rocket is going to blow up

2:42:56.240 --> 2:42:57.720
 and we're all fucked.

2:42:57.720 --> 2:42:59.080
 I don't know what to do.

2:42:59.080 --> 2:43:01.240
 And we have to, you have to fix,

2:43:01.240 --> 2:43:04.040
 you have to fix real like big problems there.

2:43:04.040 --> 2:43:07.720
 And like, how do you deal with that?

2:43:07.720 --> 2:43:09.320
 What do you think about that kind of life?

2:43:09.320 --> 2:43:13.080
 One, is there a way to walk through that fire?

2:43:13.920 --> 2:43:18.920
 And two, should you walk through that fire?

2:43:18.920 --> 2:43:22.120
 Well, I mean, without knowing I've never met Elon,

2:43:22.120 --> 2:43:25.760
 but certainly we have common friends in you

2:43:25.760 --> 2:43:29.680
 and in other people that he worked with long ago

2:43:29.680 --> 2:43:34.000
 in the PayPal days, all of whom speak very highly of him

2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:37.440
 and show, express immense admiration

2:43:37.440 --> 2:43:40.080
 for the number of things that he can maintain.

2:43:40.080 --> 2:43:43.160
 I think it's fair to say that he accomplishes more

2:43:43.160 --> 2:43:48.160
 before 9 a.m. than most people do in a decade.

2:43:48.160 --> 2:43:49.120
 It's clear.

2:43:49.120 --> 2:43:51.560
 And that what he does would dissolve most people

2:43:51.560 --> 2:43:53.120
 into a puddle of tears.

2:43:53.120 --> 2:43:54.760
 Mostly because of this whole thing

2:43:56.280 --> 2:43:59.600
 about the brain working hard equates

2:43:59.600 --> 2:44:02.080
 to thinking about duration path and outcome

2:44:02.080 --> 2:44:04.840
 and anticipating outcomes given A, B, C, or D,

2:44:04.840 --> 2:44:09.400
 a lot of very scripted linear thinking and prediction.

2:44:09.400 --> 2:44:11.400
 And that is hard, it's stressful.

2:44:11.400 --> 2:44:14.080
 It requires intense neurochemical output.

2:44:14.080 --> 2:44:16.200
 And he's doing that for multiple projects.

2:44:16.200 --> 2:44:18.360
 So presumably he's buffered himself

2:44:18.360 --> 2:44:21.160
 from the coffee maker issues and the little tiny issues,

2:44:21.160 --> 2:44:23.880
 but he is himself, unless there's something I don't know,

2:44:23.880 --> 2:44:26.280
 he's walking around in a biological system.

2:44:26.280 --> 2:44:27.120
 He is.

2:44:27.120 --> 2:44:29.280
 Yes, allegedly, yes.

2:44:29.280 --> 2:44:30.120
 Yeah, allegedly.

2:44:30.120 --> 2:44:33.600
 So, and I don't wanna reveal too much here,

2:44:33.600 --> 2:44:38.600
 but I have a common coworker and colleague

2:44:39.160 --> 2:44:42.760
 through some contract work I do that what I can tell you

2:44:42.760 --> 2:44:45.200
 is that he's accessing the best resources

2:44:45.200 --> 2:44:48.200
 in terms of how to optimize his biology.

2:44:48.200 --> 2:44:51.720
 And he's thinking about that, not just for himself,

2:44:51.720 --> 2:44:53.240
 but for all of Neuralink.

2:44:53.240 --> 2:44:55.960
 Because I think, I'm not trying to dodge the question,

2:44:55.960 --> 2:44:59.320
 but I think there's the scale of the individual,

2:44:59.320 --> 2:45:02.560
 but then there's the companies that he's creating.

2:45:02.560 --> 2:45:05.120
 And you've got people there that you could imagine

2:45:05.120 --> 2:45:07.560
 if they're working at 10% better capacity

2:45:07.560 --> 2:45:12.000
 or can focus 5% better for 20% of the day,

2:45:12.000 --> 2:45:15.560
 you're looking at a enormous increase in productivity

2:45:15.560 --> 2:45:17.880
 and a reduction in the time to reach goals,

2:45:17.880 --> 2:45:21.120
 which will reduce the amount of stress presumably on Elon,

2:45:21.120 --> 2:45:23.800
 unless he goes and starts another endeavor.

2:45:23.800 --> 2:45:28.560
 So I think it's certainly not healthy for most people.

2:45:28.560 --> 2:45:31.040
 It seems to be where he gets his dopamine hits.

2:45:31.040 --> 2:45:34.160
 I'm also really struck by the fact that he has a family

2:45:34.160 --> 2:45:38.000
 and he's got kids growing up and a relationship

2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:40.960
 and all that, so it's super impressive.

2:45:40.960 --> 2:45:44.880
 I think that, I don't know, how old is Elon?

2:45:44.880 --> 2:45:48.520
 He's 40, I mean, pushing 50, I think 48.

2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:51.320
 Even more impressive.

2:45:51.320 --> 2:45:55.480
 Because many people who've been at exceedingly high output

2:45:55.480 --> 2:45:58.620
 for a decade or more don't do well.

2:45:58.620 --> 2:46:00.000
 Their system breaks down.

2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:02.360
 Well, this is what he was saying.

2:46:03.360 --> 2:46:06.800
 Actually, I mean, I don't listen to all of his interviews,

2:46:06.800 --> 2:46:09.640
 but on that live on the clubhouse,

2:46:09.640 --> 2:46:13.400
 he mentioned that he was kind of worried,

2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:17.660
 it's interesting, he was worried that sometimes,

2:46:18.780 --> 2:46:20.360
 what I think he said is,

2:46:20.360 --> 2:46:25.360
 I'm worried that at some point my brain is just going to fail

2:46:26.040 --> 2:46:28.880
 because of the amount of load it's under,

2:46:28.880 --> 2:46:33.880
 like how much I have to think through throughout the day,

2:46:34.080 --> 2:46:38.240
 like how many problems you have to think through.

2:46:38.240 --> 2:46:41.240
 Like, it's like puzzles, it's constant puzzle solving.

2:46:41.240 --> 2:46:43.880
 I would be concerned about taking somebody

2:46:43.880 --> 2:46:46.000
 who's in that regime and suddenly putting them

2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:47.640
 into a regime where they don't have enough

2:46:47.640 --> 2:46:48.520
 to bite down into.

2:46:48.520 --> 2:46:49.800
 It's like my bulldog, Costello,

2:46:49.800 --> 2:46:51.520
 he's happiest when chewing and tugging

2:46:51.520 --> 2:46:53.200
 at that big old neck of his,

2:46:53.200 --> 2:46:55.080
 and he is just not going to become a retriever,

2:46:55.080 --> 2:46:57.560
 he's not going to, he does well

2:46:57.560 --> 2:47:00.640
 and gets his dopamine hits from chewing and pulling.

2:47:00.640 --> 2:47:04.240
 And it seems like Elon has ended up where he is

2:47:04.240 --> 2:47:07.800
 by way of his natural leanings.

2:47:07.800 --> 2:47:12.160
 Unless there's a backstory that's trauma based or something,

2:47:12.160 --> 2:47:15.240
 and I don't even begin to think that there is,

2:47:15.240 --> 2:47:16.800
 it seems that he has,

2:47:16.800 --> 2:47:18.680
 he's one of those rare individuals in history

2:47:18.680 --> 2:47:21.240
 that has an immense drive to create

2:47:21.240 --> 2:47:22.680
 in all these different domains.

2:47:22.680 --> 2:47:24.360
 I'm just saying the obvious here,

2:47:24.360 --> 2:47:27.360
 but it seems like that's what makes him tick.

2:47:27.360 --> 2:47:29.000
 I mean, you're doing an awful lot too.

2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:32.020
 Well, the problem is not really,

2:47:33.080 --> 2:47:36.280
 the problem is I've been on the verge

2:47:36.280 --> 2:47:39.640
 of pulling the trigger on starting a company,

2:47:39.640 --> 2:47:43.160
 which will increase the workload significantly.

2:47:43.160 --> 2:47:48.160
 And I'm attracted to that because of a dream I have,

2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:51.960
 but it's a little bit scary

2:47:51.960 --> 2:47:56.380
 because it can destroy you in a lot of ways.

2:47:56.380 --> 2:47:59.120
 There's two sources of destruction.

2:47:59.120 --> 2:48:02.320
 So one source is,

2:48:02.320 --> 2:48:06.340
 I've, for the first time in my life,

2:48:06.340 --> 2:48:10.420
 a few months ago, I think,

2:48:10.420 --> 2:48:14.100
 have gotten, this feels like such a noob thing to say it,

2:48:14.100 --> 2:48:16.820
 but I've gotten some hate on the internet.

2:48:16.820 --> 2:48:17.740
 No.

2:48:17.740 --> 2:48:18.580
 I know, right?

2:48:18.580 --> 2:48:19.420
 No.

2:48:19.420 --> 2:48:20.700
 But like, I am such an idiot.

2:48:20.700 --> 2:48:22.900
 I'm so naive to, it was,

2:48:24.520 --> 2:48:28.040
 I had the question that I guess a lot of people have

2:48:28.040 --> 2:48:29.360
 when they get hate on the internet.

2:48:29.360 --> 2:48:32.940
 It's like, mom, why are these people

2:48:32.940 --> 2:48:35.460
 making up stuff about me?

2:48:35.460 --> 2:48:39.020
 That kind of feeling of like, why are you saying that?

2:48:39.020 --> 2:48:43.420
 And the reason I mentioned that is like,

2:48:43.420 --> 2:48:46.340
 well, if you wanna go and start a business

2:48:46.340 --> 2:48:49.780
 and do, as I think people should

2:48:49.780 --> 2:48:53.380
 when they start a big, ambitious business,

2:48:53.380 --> 2:48:54.980
 really try to go big.

2:48:54.980 --> 2:48:58.040
 Like, what does success look like

2:48:58.040 --> 2:49:00.740
 in terms of your emotional journey?

2:49:00.740 --> 2:49:02.560
 You're going to have a lot of people

2:49:02.560 --> 2:49:05.080
 who make up stuff about you,

2:49:05.080 --> 2:49:06.680
 who say negative things.

2:49:06.680 --> 2:49:09.260
 I mean, majority, hopefully, if you do a good job,

2:49:09.260 --> 2:49:10.720
 will be supportive and,

2:49:10.720 --> 2:49:13.480
 but there's still going to be this army of people there.

2:49:13.480 --> 2:49:16.100
 And like, that was scary to me

2:49:16.100 --> 2:49:20.520
 because of how much emotional impact that had on me.

2:49:20.520 --> 2:49:22.880
 Well, and I also know a little bit,

2:49:22.880 --> 2:49:24.240
 I have some glimpse into the fact

2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:27.280
 that you put your heart and soul into everything you do.

2:49:27.280 --> 2:49:30.600
 You're not a, you're lighthearted about certain things,

2:49:30.600 --> 2:49:32.200
 but you're even lighthearted

2:49:32.200 --> 2:49:35.980
 about being full gas pedal 24 seven.

2:49:35.980 --> 2:49:37.040
 There's kind of this,

2:49:40.640 --> 2:49:42.220
 Laird Hamilton always says,

2:49:42.220 --> 2:49:45.340
 the big wave surfers, he always says,

2:49:45.340 --> 2:49:46.640
 bright light, dark shadow.

2:49:47.640 --> 2:49:50.760
 And I think it's that intensity.

2:49:50.760 --> 2:49:51.720
 And when you do that,

2:49:51.720 --> 2:49:54.760
 and then suddenly people are starting to like,

2:49:54.760 --> 2:49:56.400
 throw some paint on your picture,

2:49:56.400 --> 2:49:57.980
 you're like, wait, hold on, you know,

2:49:57.980 --> 2:50:00.040
 you're going max capacity.

2:50:00.040 --> 2:50:02.240
 But I think the company is interesting one

2:50:02.240 --> 2:50:05.080
 because you've talked about doing this company before.

2:50:05.080 --> 2:50:05.920
 I've been afraid.

2:50:05.920 --> 2:50:09.360
 I just not been pulling the trigger out of fear

2:50:09.360 --> 2:50:10.440
 because I enjoy this life.

2:50:10.440 --> 2:50:12.560
 This is, it's starting to interrupt.

2:50:12.560 --> 2:50:16.740
 It's ultimately this question of taking a leap is like,

2:50:17.920 --> 2:50:21.160
 say you're in academia, it's like you're at MIT,

2:50:21.160 --> 2:50:23.800
 you're, I really love doing research at MIT.

2:50:23.800 --> 2:50:25.600
 I really love that life.

2:50:25.600 --> 2:50:27.240
 Why take a leap out?

2:50:27.240 --> 2:50:30.440
 You know, but I did because it's been a dream,

2:50:30.440 --> 2:50:33.300
 but now accidentally along the way,

2:50:33.300 --> 2:50:35.760
 I found this podcasting thing,

2:50:35.760 --> 2:50:37.880
 which is also really fulfilling.

2:50:37.880 --> 2:50:41.120
 And you know, it's like, why take a leap?

2:50:41.120 --> 2:50:44.180
 Cause you have a huge lust for life.

2:50:44.180 --> 2:50:45.020
 Yeah.

2:50:45.020 --> 2:50:45.840
 I mean, that's you.

2:50:45.840 --> 2:50:47.460
 I mean, sometimes when I'm on the internet

2:50:47.460 --> 2:50:49.400
 and I think, is this, you hear about it like,

2:50:49.400 --> 2:50:52.080
 oh, it's addicting, you know, YouTube's addicting all that.

2:50:52.080 --> 2:50:54.720
 Actually, sometimes I think maybe that's true,

2:50:54.720 --> 2:50:57.800
 but a lot of times I just think there's so much here.

2:50:57.800 --> 2:50:59.520
 There's a lot of garbage,

2:50:59.520 --> 2:51:02.800
 but there's so many gems out there in the world now.

2:51:02.800 --> 2:51:06.580
 It's almost like, sure how you allocate time is key,

2:51:06.580 --> 2:51:10.100
 but I think you can do it all.

2:51:11.140 --> 2:51:14.520
 Not, maybe not five more things, but all.

2:51:14.520 --> 2:51:16.240
 And one thing, I just had this idea

2:51:16.240 --> 2:51:18.440
 and this is not grounded in any scientific paper,

2:51:18.440 --> 2:51:20.280
 but I think the answer might come to you

2:51:20.280 --> 2:51:24.440
 during this torture that you're about to get yourself

2:51:24.440 --> 2:51:26.880
 through with David, because in those mental states,

2:51:26.880 --> 2:51:29.320
 you're really asking the question, right?

2:51:29.320 --> 2:51:32.640
 You're asking the question, where is my capacity?

2:51:32.640 --> 2:51:35.600
 And am I even close to my capacity?

2:51:35.600 --> 2:51:38.000
 And if I am, what's of the most value?

2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:40.320
 I think we find the answers to those things

2:51:40.320 --> 2:51:43.560
 in those nonverbal, nonanalytic states.

2:51:43.560 --> 2:51:45.920
 It just comes to us.

2:51:45.920 --> 2:51:50.600
 I hope you're right, and I hope it's a profoundly

2:51:50.600 --> 2:51:52.400
 fulfilling experience as opposed to one

2:51:52.400 --> 2:51:54.520
 that leads to my demise, but.

2:51:54.520 --> 2:51:55.800
 You have a will, right?

2:51:55.800 --> 2:51:59.200
 It all goes to the hedgehog.

2:51:59.200 --> 2:52:01.660
 Yeah, exactly, to the hedgehog.

2:52:01.660 --> 2:52:02.960
 Now it all makes sense.

2:52:02.960 --> 2:52:06.920
 Andrew, like we talked about offline and on this podcast,

2:52:06.920 --> 2:52:09.620
 I do hope we write some stuff together,

2:52:09.620 --> 2:52:10.800
 do some research together.

2:52:10.800 --> 2:52:15.000
 You're one of the most inspiring scientists,

2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:17.960
 speaking of communicating to the world.

2:52:18.840 --> 2:52:22.400
 So I can't wait to see what you do with the podcast.

2:52:22.400 --> 2:52:23.600
 I'm already a huge fan.

2:52:23.600 --> 2:52:25.400
 I've been telling everybody about it.

2:52:26.300 --> 2:52:30.000
 I can't wait to see you talk to Joe as well soon.

2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:32.600
 And I can't wait to see what kind of paper

2:52:32.600 --> 2:52:33.440
 we write together.

2:52:33.440 --> 2:52:34.840
 Thanks so much for talking to me.

2:52:34.840 --> 2:52:37.020
 Thank you, that project's gonna be a lot of fun.

2:52:37.020 --> 2:52:39.000
 Can't wait, and thanks again for having me on.

2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:40.200
 Appreciate you, brother.

 from Woodrow Wilson.

2:53:06.640 --> 2:53:09.240
 We should not only use the brains we have,

2:53:09.240 --> 2:53:11.760
 but all that we can borrow.

2:53:11.760 --> 2:53:14.520
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
