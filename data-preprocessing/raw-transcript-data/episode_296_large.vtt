00:00.000 --> 00:02.040
 I think that some people are deliberately trying

00:02.040 --> 00:05.720
 to completely clear the cultural landscape of our past

00:05.720 --> 00:08.160
 in order to say there's nothing good,

00:08.160 --> 00:10.840
 nothing you can hold on to, no one you should revere,

00:10.840 --> 00:13.680
 you've got no heroes, the whole thing comes down,

00:13.680 --> 00:15.960
 who's left standing, oh, we've also got this idea

00:15.960 --> 00:18.720
 from the 20th century still about Marxism,

00:18.720 --> 00:23.720
 and no, no, I will not have the entire landscape

00:23.720 --> 00:30.720
 deracinated, and then the worst ideas tried again.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.800
 The following is a conversation with Douglas Murray,

00:33.800 --> 00:38.160
 author of The Madness of Crowds, Gender, Race, and Identity,

00:38.160 --> 00:41.400
 and his most recent book, The War on the West,

00:41.400 --> 00:44.720
 How to Prevail in the Age of Unreason.

00:44.720 --> 00:48.800
 He's a brilliant, fearless, and often controversial thinker

00:48.800 --> 00:52.400
 who points out and pushes back against what he sees

00:52.400 --> 00:55.440
 as the madness of our modern world.

00:55.440 --> 00:57.960
 I should note that the use of the word Marxism

00:57.960 --> 01:01.520
 and the West in this conversation refers primarily

01:01.520 --> 01:04.880
 to cultural Marxism and the cultural values

01:04.880 --> 01:07.440
 of Western civilization, respectively.

01:07.440 --> 01:10.360
 This is in contrast to my previous conversation

01:10.360 --> 01:14.120
 with Richard Wolff, where we focused on Marxism

01:14.120 --> 01:16.680
 as primarily a critique of capitalism,

01:16.680 --> 01:19.080
 and thus looking at it through the lens

01:19.080 --> 01:21.920
 of economics and not culture.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.480
 Nevertheless, these two episodes stand opposite

01:24.480 --> 01:27.000
 of each other with very different perspectives

01:27.000 --> 01:30.640
 on how we build a flourishing civilization together.

01:30.640 --> 01:34.080
 I leave it to you, the listener, to think

01:34.080 --> 01:37.000
 and to decide which is the better way.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.080
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:40.080 --> 01:42.320
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:42.320 --> 01:43.520
 in the description.

01:43.520 --> 01:48.000
 And now, dear friends, here's Douglas Murray.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.120
 You recently wrote the book titled The War on the West,

01:52.120 --> 01:54.560
 which in part says that the values, ideas,

01:54.560 --> 01:57.400
 and history of Western civilization are under attack.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.680
 So let's start with the basics.

01:59.680 --> 02:03.040
 Historically and today, what are the ideas

02:03.040 --> 02:05.120
 that represent Western civilization?

02:05.120 --> 02:07.000
 The good, the bad, the ugly.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.800
 I actually don't get stuck on definitions,

02:09.800 --> 02:11.800
 precisely because, as you know, once you get stuck

02:11.800 --> 02:13.120
 on definitions, there's a possibility

02:13.120 --> 02:13.960
 you'll never get off them.

02:13.960 --> 02:14.800
 Yes.

02:16.600 --> 02:17.560
 I'd say a few things.

02:17.560 --> 02:20.240
 Firstly, obviously the Western tradition

02:20.240 --> 02:22.880
 is a specific tradition, a specific tradition

02:22.880 --> 02:27.040
 of ideas, culture, well known to be, perhaps,

02:27.040 --> 02:29.640
 easily defined by the combination of Athens

02:29.640 --> 02:33.000
 and Jerusalem, the world of the Bible,

02:33.000 --> 02:36.340
 and the world of ancient Greece and, indeed, Rome.

02:38.080 --> 02:41.060
 Effectively, it creates European civilization,

02:41.060 --> 02:44.360
 which itself spawns the rest of the Western civilizations,

02:44.360 --> 02:48.640
 America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and others.

02:48.640 --> 02:49.880
 But these are the main countries

02:49.880 --> 02:52.880
 that we still refer to as the West.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.480
 So there's a specific tradition

02:54.480 --> 02:56.480
 and all the things that come from it.

02:58.080 --> 03:01.620
 My shorthand cheat on this answer is to say,

03:02.560 --> 03:04.060
 you know when you're not in it.

03:05.160 --> 03:08.720
 So if you've ever been to Beijing, Shanghai,

03:08.720 --> 03:10.540
 you know you're not in the West.

03:10.540 --> 03:12.820
 Somewhere else, you know you're not in the West.

03:12.820 --> 03:15.400
 When you're in Tokyo, you're somewhere extraordinary,

03:15.400 --> 03:17.360
 but you know you're not in the West.

03:18.400 --> 03:22.660
 Obviously, there are, let's say, borderline questions,

03:22.660 --> 03:24.440
 like is Russia in the West,

03:25.840 --> 03:28.740
 which I sort of leave open as a question.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.240
 Possibly.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.880
 Well, if you were placed into Moscow blindfolded

03:34.880 --> 03:38.240
 and you woke up and you couldn't hear the language,

03:38.240 --> 03:40.080
 or maybe you didn't know what the language sounded like,

03:40.080 --> 03:42.920
 would you guess you were in the West or not?

03:42.920 --> 03:44.600
 I think I was somewhere near it.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.160
 Getting closer.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.560
 I mean, you know, it's also a question, doesn't it,

03:49.560 --> 03:51.080
 whether it's European.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.920
 And I think the answer to that is not really,

03:53.920 --> 03:55.960
 although massively influenced by Europe,

03:55.960 --> 03:59.040
 but, and times wanting to reach towards it,

03:59.040 --> 04:01.120
 at times wanting to stay away,

04:01.120 --> 04:04.760
 but a part of the West, possibly, yes.

04:07.420 --> 04:09.920
 But anyway, it's a very specific tradition.

04:09.920 --> 04:13.920
 It's one of a number of major traditions in the world,

04:13.920 --> 04:16.920
 and because it's hard to define

04:16.920 --> 04:19.400
 doesn't mean it doesn't exist, you know.

04:19.400 --> 04:21.160
 Are there certain characteristics and qualities

04:21.160 --> 04:23.960
 about the values and the ideas that define it?

04:23.960 --> 04:28.120
 Is the type of rule, the type of governmental structure?

04:28.120 --> 04:29.040
 Yes.

04:29.040 --> 04:32.080
 I mean, the rule of law, property owning democracies,

04:32.960 --> 04:35.440
 and much more, I mean, these are, of course,

04:35.440 --> 04:37.820
 things that ended up being developed in America

04:37.820 --> 04:41.080
 and then given back to much of the rest of the West.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.780
 I'd say there are other,

04:46.400 --> 04:48.320
 perhaps more controversial attributes

04:48.320 --> 04:49.300
 I would give to the West.

04:49.300 --> 04:53.180
 One is a ravenous interest in the rest of the world,

04:53.180 --> 04:55.880
 which is not shared, of course, by every other culture.

04:57.100 --> 04:59.360
 The late philosopher George Steiner

04:59.360 --> 05:00.980
 who said he could never get out of his head

05:00.980 --> 05:02.880
 the haunting fact that the boats

05:02.880 --> 05:05.760
 only seemed to go out from Europe.

05:05.760 --> 05:10.760
 You know, the explorers, the scholars, the linguists,

05:10.960 --> 05:14.600
 the people who wanted to discover other civilizations,

05:14.600 --> 05:17.220
 and indeed, even resurrect ancient civilizations

05:17.220 --> 05:18.920
 and lost civilizations.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.000
 These were scholars that were always coming from the West

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
 to discover this elsewhere.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.200
 By contrast, you know, there were never boats

05:25.200 --> 05:27.780
 coming from Egypt to help the Anglo Saxons

05:27.780 --> 05:30.480
 discover the origins of their language and so on.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.840
 So I think there is a sort of ravenous interest

05:32.840 --> 05:33.820
 in the rest of the world,

05:33.820 --> 05:35.620
 which can be said to be a Western.

05:35.620 --> 05:36.940
 Attribute, although it, of course,

05:36.940 --> 05:39.440
 also has, one should immediately preface it,

05:39.440 --> 05:41.760
 some downsides and many criticisms

05:41.760 --> 05:43.320
 that can be made of some of the consequences

05:43.320 --> 05:44.320
 of that interest.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.760
 Because, of course, it's not entirely lacking

05:48.760 --> 05:50.560
 in self interest.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.240
 So it's not just the scholars, it's also.

05:53.240 --> 05:54.100
 The armies.

05:54.100 --> 05:57.640
 The armies, and they're looking to gain access

05:57.640 --> 05:59.680
 and control over resources elsewhere.

05:59.680 --> 06:00.520
 To market.

06:00.520 --> 06:03.720
 And hence the imperial imperative.

06:03.720 --> 06:04.560
 Exactly.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.240
 To conquer, to expand.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.520
 Although that itself, of course, is a universal thing.

06:08.520 --> 06:13.000
 I mean, no civilization, I think, that we know of

06:13.000 --> 06:17.240
 doesn't try to gain ground from its neighbors where it can.

06:17.240 --> 06:19.720
 The Western ability to go further faster

06:21.440 --> 06:23.620
 certainly gave an advantage in that regard.

06:23.620 --> 06:26.720
 Do some civilizations get a bit more excited

06:26.720 --> 06:28.440
 by that kind of idea than others?

06:28.440 --> 06:29.440
 Possible.

06:29.440 --> 06:30.280
 It's possible.

06:30.280 --> 06:33.880
 Because you could say it's the Western civilization

06:33.880 --> 06:38.680
 because the technological innovation was more efficient

06:38.680 --> 06:39.520
 at doing that kind of thing.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.360
 Absolutely.

06:40.360 --> 06:41.880
 But maybe it wanted it more, too.

06:41.880 --> 06:44.800
 Well, the Ottomans wanted it an awful lot

06:44.800 --> 06:48.160
 and did very terribly well for many centuries,

06:48.160 --> 06:52.120
 and one shouldn't forget that, as did others.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.160
 I'd also say, by the way, and again,

06:55.160 --> 06:57.200
 it's a very broad one, but it's worth throwing out there.

06:57.200 --> 07:02.200
 I think self criticism is an important attribute

07:02.200 --> 07:05.680
 of the Western mind, one that, as you know,

07:05.680 --> 07:07.840
 is not common everywhere.

07:07.840 --> 07:11.560
 Not all societies allow even their most vociferous critics

07:11.560 --> 07:13.000
 to become rich.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.980
 So criticism is a negative sounding word.

07:15.980 --> 07:19.400
 It could be self introspection, self analysis,

07:19.400 --> 07:20.680
 self reflection.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.160
 And it can be what you need.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.760
 And in the Western system, I'd argue that one of the

07:26.760 --> 07:30.080
 advantages of the system of representative governance

07:30.080 --> 07:32.600
 is that where there are problems in the system,

07:32.600 --> 07:36.740
 you can attempt to sort them out by peaceable means.

07:38.560 --> 07:41.240
 We listen to arguments, most famously in America

07:41.240 --> 07:44.360
 in the late 20th century, the civil rights movement

07:44.360 --> 07:48.060
 achieved its aims by force of moral argument

07:48.060 --> 07:49.440
 and dissuaded the rest of the country

07:49.440 --> 07:50.800
 that it had been wrong.

07:51.920 --> 07:55.840
 That's not common in every society by any means.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.640
 So I think there are certain attributes of the Western mind

07:58.640 --> 08:03.280
 that you could say are, they're not entirely unique,

08:03.280 --> 08:06.540
 but they are not as commonplace elsewhere.

08:06.540 --> 08:10.340
 What about the emergence in hierarchies of asymmetry

08:10.340 --> 08:15.340
 of power, most visible, most drastic in the form of slavery,

08:16.560 --> 08:18.080
 for example?

08:18.080 --> 08:19.920
 Well, I mean, everyone in the world is slavery,

08:19.920 --> 08:22.160
 so I don't regard it as being a Western,

08:22.160 --> 08:23.640
 a unique Western sin.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.560
 It's rather hard to think of a civilization in history

08:27.560 --> 08:29.360
 that didn't have slavery of some kind.

08:29.360 --> 08:32.520
 One of the oddities of the Western ignorance of our day

08:32.520 --> 08:35.360
 is that people seem to imagine that our societies

08:35.360 --> 08:37.040
 in the West were the only ones who ever engaged

08:37.040 --> 08:39.000
 in any vices.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.480
 Alas, this isn't true.

08:40.480 --> 08:43.000
 It's a sort of Rousseauian mistake,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.640
 or at least one that's blossomed since Rousseau,

08:45.640 --> 08:47.980
 that everybody else in the world was born

08:47.980 --> 08:49.480
 into sort of Edenic innocence,

08:49.480 --> 08:52.720
 and only we in the West had this sort of evil in us

08:52.720 --> 08:55.880
 that caused us to do bad things to other people.

08:55.880 --> 08:58.280
 Slavery was engaged in by everyone in the ancient world,

08:58.280 --> 09:01.760
 of course, and through most of the modern world as well.

09:01.760 --> 09:04.520
 Of course, there are 40 million slaves in the world today,

09:04.520 --> 09:07.540
 so it's clearly not something that the species as a whole

09:07.540 --> 09:08.600
 has a problem with.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.200
 And that's more slaves, of course,

09:11.200 --> 09:13.000
 than there were in the 19th century.

09:14.040 --> 09:17.840
 And I'd say, on top of that, that the interesting thing

09:17.840 --> 09:19.960
 about the Western mind as regards to slavery

09:19.960 --> 09:23.560
 is that we were the civilization that did away with it.

09:23.560 --> 09:26.280
 And by the way, the founding fathers of America,

09:26.280 --> 09:30.800
 who today are lambasted routinely

09:30.800 --> 09:34.460
 for being acquiescent in the slave trade,

09:35.360 --> 09:37.800
 engaging in it, owning slaves.

09:40.040 --> 09:43.520
 People almost don't even bother now to recognize the facts

09:43.520 --> 09:46.740
 that Thomas Jefferson, George Washington,

09:46.740 --> 09:49.360
 all wanted to see this trade done away with,

09:49.360 --> 09:51.340
 couldn't hold the country together at the origins

09:51.340 --> 09:53.280
 if they'd have made such an effort.

09:53.280 --> 09:55.680
 And believed and hoped that it would be something

09:55.680 --> 09:58.780
 that would be dealt with after their time.

09:58.780 --> 10:03.080
 So the founding ideas had within them the notion

10:03.080 --> 10:05.880
 that we should, as a people, get rid of this.

10:05.880 --> 10:08.480
 The opening lines of the Declaration of Independence

10:08.480 --> 10:12.560
 set up the conditions under which slavery

10:12.560 --> 10:14.600
 will be impossible.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.720
 All men are created equal.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.680
 Once you've put that, that's a time bomb

10:19.680 --> 10:22.660
 under the whole concept of slavery.

10:22.660 --> 10:24.840
 That's ticking away, okay.

10:24.840 --> 10:28.360
 And sure enough, it detonated in the next century.

10:28.360 --> 10:32.640
 If we just step back and look at the human species,

10:32.640 --> 10:36.360
 what does slavery teach you about human nature?

10:36.360 --> 10:41.360
 The fact that slavery has appeared

10:41.720 --> 10:44.360
 as a function of society throughout human history.

10:44.360 --> 10:45.760
 There are two possibilities.

10:47.420 --> 10:51.520
 One is it's what people think they can do

10:51.520 --> 10:52.880
 when God's not watching.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.320
 Another is it's what they can do

10:56.320 --> 10:57.960
 if they think that God allows it.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.080
 Really, really well put.

11:02.080 --> 11:07.080
 And the fact that they want to do this kind of subjugation,

11:09.280 --> 11:10.880
 what does that mean?

11:10.880 --> 11:13.380
 Well, I mean, it's pretty straightforward in a way.

11:14.480 --> 11:17.080
 There are people who get to work for free.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.360
 It's economic in nature in some sense.

11:19.360 --> 11:20.960
 Yes, but in order to do it,

11:20.960 --> 11:24.320
 I mean, almost always there are some examples

11:24.320 --> 11:25.780
 in the ancient world where this wasn't the case,

11:25.780 --> 11:28.120
 but almost always it had to be a subjugated people

11:28.120 --> 11:30.560
 or people that are regarded as different.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.800
 One of the things actually I've tried to sort of inject

11:32.800 --> 11:35.960
 into the discussion through this book among other things

11:35.960 --> 11:40.680
 is a recognition that there were very major questions

11:40.680 --> 11:43.400
 still going on in the 18th and early 19th century

11:43.400 --> 11:46.920
 that were unresolved, which were one of the reasons

11:46.920 --> 11:50.200
 why slavery was not as morally repugnant

11:50.200 --> 11:53.640
 to people then as it is to us now.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.740
 And that's the question of polygenesis and monogenesis.

11:58.120 --> 11:59.800
 At the time of Thomas Jefferson,

11:59.800 --> 12:03.040
 the founding fathers were thinking and working.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.880
 They didn't know because nobody knew

12:06.880 --> 12:09.160
 whether the human races were related or not.

12:12.880 --> 12:15.880
 There were arguments, the monogenesis argument

12:15.880 --> 12:20.460
 that we were all indeed from the same racial stock.

12:20.460 --> 12:23.520
 Polygenesis argument was that we weren't.

12:23.520 --> 12:26.040
 Black Africans, Ethiopians,

12:26.040 --> 12:27.960
 they're often referred to at the time

12:28.960 --> 12:30.840
 because they provided some of the first slaves,

12:30.840 --> 12:33.040
 were different from white Europeans,

12:33.040 --> 12:35.560
 simply not related in any way.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.280
 And that makes it easier, of course.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.860
 That makes it easier to enslave people

12:38.860 --> 12:41.200
 if you think they're not your brother.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.200
 Am I my brother's keeper?

12:42.200 --> 12:47.200
 No, he's not your brother, and it's a very,

12:51.440 --> 12:54.440
 it was a very troubling argument in the 18th, 19th century,

12:54.440 --> 12:56.200
 also because there was a biblical question.

12:56.200 --> 12:59.680
 It threw up a theological question, which was,

12:59.680 --> 13:03.600
 I mean, people were literally debating this at the time.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.200
 Was there also a black Adam and Eve?

13:08.560 --> 13:11.220
 Was there, as it were, an Indian Adam and Eve,

13:11.220 --> 13:12.820
 a Native American Adam and Eve?

13:14.200 --> 13:17.120
 This was a serious theological debate

13:17.120 --> 13:19.260
 because they didn't know the answer.

13:19.260 --> 13:22.920
 People say that Darwin solved this.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.240
 It wasn't just Darwin, of course,

13:25.240 --> 13:28.360
 but by the late 19th century,

13:28.360 --> 13:32.360
 the argument that we were not all related

13:32.360 --> 13:35.000
 as human beings had suffered so many blows

13:35.000 --> 13:38.880
 that you had to really be very, very ignorant,

13:38.880 --> 13:41.380
 deliberately, willfully ignorant to ignore it by then.

13:41.380 --> 13:45.080
 So it no longer was, after Darwin, a theological question.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.800
 It became a moral question.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.160
 It was already a moral question, but it clarified,

13:49.160 --> 13:51.140
 Darwin clarifies it definitely,

13:51.140 --> 13:53.440
 and then you're in this, as I say, in this situation

13:53.440 --> 13:55.880
 of you're not subjugating some other people.

13:55.880 --> 13:58.720
 You're subjugating your own kin,

13:58.720 --> 14:02.260
 and that becomes morally unsustainable.

14:03.400 --> 14:07.840
 So given that slavery in America

14:07.840 --> 14:11.380
 is part of its history,

14:14.160 --> 14:19.160
 how do we incorporate into the calculus of policy today,

14:21.360 --> 14:26.160
 social discourse, what we learn in school?

14:26.160 --> 14:27.560
 We can look at slavery in America.

14:27.560 --> 14:30.760
 We can look at maybe more recent things,

14:30.760 --> 14:35.120
 like in Europe, the other atrocities, the Holocaust.

14:35.120 --> 14:39.240
 How do we incorporate that in terms of

14:39.240 --> 14:41.200
 how we create policy, how we treat each other,

14:41.200 --> 14:43.120
 all those kinds of things?

14:43.120 --> 14:47.200
 What is the calculus of integrating the atrocities,

14:47.200 --> 14:51.600
 the injustices of the past into the way we are today?

14:51.600 --> 14:52.980
 That's a very complex question,

14:52.980 --> 14:55.420
 because it's a moral question at this point,

14:56.300 --> 14:58.820
 and a moral question long after the fact.

15:01.520 --> 15:02.880
 I say at one point in the War on the West

15:02.880 --> 15:05.760
 that the argument, for instance, on reparations now

15:05.760 --> 15:09.000
 that goes on, and it's not a fringe argument anymore.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.960
 Some people say, oh, you're pulling up this fringe argument.

15:10.960 --> 15:11.800
 It really isn't.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.720
 I mean, every contender for the Democratic nomination

15:14.720 --> 15:18.200
 for the presidency in 2020 was willing to talk

15:18.200 --> 15:20.400
 about the possibility of reparations.

15:20.400 --> 15:24.160
 Some very eager that this country, America,

15:24.160 --> 15:28.400
 goes through that entirely self destructive exercise.

15:28.400 --> 15:33.360
 I say that there's a lot of problems with this,

15:33.360 --> 15:36.680
 but if I could refine it down to one thing, I'd say this.

15:36.680 --> 15:38.600
 It's no longer about a wealth transfer

15:38.600 --> 15:40.480
 from one group of people who did something wrong

15:40.480 --> 15:42.760
 to another group of people who were wronged.

15:42.760 --> 15:44.720
 It would have been that, could have been that

15:44.720 --> 15:46.480
 200 years ago.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.840
 Today, it's not even the descendants of people

15:48.840 --> 15:50.600
 who did something wrong giving money to people

15:50.600 --> 15:53.560
 who were the descendants of people who were wronged.

15:53.560 --> 15:56.680
 It's a wealth transfer from people who look like people

15:56.680 --> 15:59.080
 who did a wrong thing in the past to another group

15:59.080 --> 16:01.680
 of people who resemble people who were wronged.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.440
 That's impossible to do, and I'm completely clear

16:06.440 --> 16:07.600
 about this.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.400
 There is no way in which you could organize

16:11.400 --> 16:16.400
 such a wealth transfer on moral or practical reasons.

16:17.160 --> 16:21.520
 America is filled with people who have the same skin color

16:21.520 --> 16:23.920
 as us, for instance, who have no connection

16:23.920 --> 16:27.520
 to the slave trade and should not be made to pay money

16:27.520 --> 16:30.600
 to people who have some connection.

16:30.600 --> 16:34.200
 And then the country's also filled with ethnic minorities

16:34.200 --> 16:39.240
 who have come after slavery who would not be due

16:39.240 --> 16:41.840
 for any reimbursement, as it were.

16:42.760 --> 16:46.520
 The problem with this is, though, is that there are,

16:46.520 --> 16:48.160
 I'm perfectly open to the possibility

16:48.160 --> 16:51.520
 that there are residual inequities

16:51.520 --> 16:53.680
 that exist in American life

16:53.680 --> 16:56.280
 and that the consequences of slavery

16:56.280 --> 17:00.160
 could be one of the factors that result from this.

17:01.520 --> 17:06.520
 The thing is, I don't think it's a single issue answer.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.400
 I think it's a multidimensional issue,

17:10.400 --> 17:12.560
 something like black underachievement in America.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.560
 It's obviously a multidimensional issue.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.320
 Much of the left and others wish to say it's not.

17:20.320 --> 17:22.360
 It's only about racism.

17:22.360 --> 17:26.200
 And they can't answer why Asians who've arrived

17:26.200 --> 17:28.120
 more recently don't, for instance,

17:28.120 --> 17:30.520
 get held down by white supremacy.

17:30.520 --> 17:34.840
 But actually, I say white supremacy in quotes, obviously.

17:34.840 --> 17:37.520
 But don't get held back by it, but actually flourish

17:37.520 --> 17:39.760
 to the extent that Asian Americans

17:39.760 --> 17:41.760
 have higher household earnings

17:41.760 --> 17:44.240
 and higher household mean equity than,

17:47.720 --> 17:50.600
 home equity and so on, than white Americans.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.920
 So I don't think that on the merits the evidence is there

17:53.920 --> 17:56.760
 that racism is the explanation for black,

17:56.760 --> 17:59.280
 ongoing black underachievement in some sections

17:59.280 --> 18:01.280
 of the black community in America.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.000
 It's obviously a part of it.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.120
 Could you say that even those things like fatherlessness

18:07.120 --> 18:11.640
 and similar family breakdown issues

18:12.720 --> 18:14.920
 are a longterm consequence of it?

18:16.520 --> 18:19.840
 Possibly, but it's being often said

18:19.840 --> 18:23.040
 it's being awfully generous to people's ability

18:23.040 --> 18:24.880
 to make bad decisions.

18:24.880 --> 18:27.560
 For instance, how many generations after the Holocaust

18:27.560 --> 18:30.600
 would you allow people to claim that everything

18:30.600 --> 18:33.040
 that went wrong in the Jewish community

18:33.040 --> 18:35.440
 was as a result of the Holocaust?

18:35.440 --> 18:39.120
 I mean, is there some kind of term limit on this?

18:39.120 --> 18:40.720
 I would have thought so.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.560
 And I think most people probably think that's over.

18:43.560 --> 18:50.560
 I think the details matter there, but it's very difficult.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.440
 You're in deep waters, yeah.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.360
 Oh, I enjoy swimming out in the ocean,

18:54.360 --> 18:58.440
 so although I'm terrified of what's lurking

18:58.440 --> 19:00.240
 underneath in the darkness.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.240
 You're right, you're right to be.

19:04.480 --> 19:07.400
 Okay, it's really complicated calculus

19:07.400 --> 19:09.960
 with the Holocaust and with slavery.

19:09.960 --> 19:14.960
 So the argument in America is that there's deep

19:15.960 --> 19:20.320
 institutional racism against African Americans

19:20.320 --> 19:22.040
 that's rooted in slavery.

19:22.960 --> 19:27.960
 And so however that calculus turns out,

19:28.080 --> 19:31.400
 that calculation, it still persists in the culture,

19:31.400 --> 19:35.120
 in the institutions, in the allocation of resources,

19:35.120 --> 19:39.200
 in the way that we communicate, in subtle ways,

19:39.200 --> 19:41.880
 in major ways, all that kind of stuff.

19:41.880 --> 19:46.080
 How is it possible to win or lose that argument

19:46.080 --> 19:48.120
 of how much institutional racism there is

19:48.120 --> 19:50.840
 that's rooted in slavery?

19:50.840 --> 19:52.120
 Is it a winnable?

19:52.120 --> 19:53.880
 It's an unquantifiable argument.

19:55.160 --> 19:58.880
 And I'd like to apply some shortcuts

19:58.880 --> 20:00.560
 to some of this, the following.

20:01.920 --> 20:06.640
 Are, for instance, all, let's take the EVV1

20:06.640 --> 20:09.080
 that's most often cited.

20:09.080 --> 20:12.000
 If a white person is walking down a street in America

20:12.000 --> 20:13.800
 and they see a group of young black men

20:13.800 --> 20:15.520
 coming towards them and it's late at night

20:15.520 --> 20:18.160
 and they cross the road, is it because of slavery?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.320
 Is it because of institutional racism?

20:23.400 --> 20:26.080
 No, it's because they've made a calculus

20:26.080 --> 20:31.080
 based not entirely on unfounded beliefs

20:34.080 --> 20:38.320
 that given crime rates, it's possible

20:38.320 --> 20:41.560
 that this group of people might be a group of people

20:41.560 --> 20:43.640
 they don't want to meet late at night.

20:43.640 --> 20:48.640
 That's an ugly fact, but as crime statistics

20:48.640 --> 20:51.080
 in American cities after American cities bear out,

20:52.360 --> 20:55.120
 it's not an entirely unreasonable one.

20:55.120 --> 20:59.360
 It's not reasonable every time, obviously, obviously.

20:59.360 --> 21:01.640
 But is it attributable to slavery?

21:02.920 --> 21:04.040
 That's a stretch.

21:04.040 --> 21:07.920
 If you're in a city like Chicago

21:07.920 --> 21:12.920
 where the homicide rates shot up in the last two years,

21:13.080 --> 21:16.160
 albeit again, as always has to be remembered,

21:16.160 --> 21:21.160
 mainly black on black gun violence and knife violence.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.920
 Nevertheless, if you're in a city like Chicago

21:23.920 --> 21:26.640
 and you make that calculus I've just suggested,

21:26.640 --> 21:30.120
 the cliched one, the street late at night,

21:31.080 --> 21:33.280
 there are other factors other than that.

21:33.280 --> 21:37.080
 Factors other than a memory of slavery that kick in.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.840
 And I'm afraid it's something which people

21:42.840 --> 21:44.560
 don't want to particularly acknowledge in America

21:44.560 --> 21:45.960
 for obvious reasons, because it's the ugliest

21:45.960 --> 21:47.680
 damn debate in the world.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.720
 But I was actually just writing in my column

21:49.720 --> 21:53.360
 in New York Post today about a very interesting case

21:53.360 --> 21:56.200
 that's sort of similar, which is the question

21:56.200 --> 21:58.680
 of obesity in the US.

21:58.680 --> 22:02.040
 As you know, America's the most overweight country

22:02.040 --> 22:03.640
 in the world.

22:03.640 --> 22:08.640
 America has, I think, 40% of the population is obese

22:08.760 --> 22:11.320
 in medical ways, and the nearest next country

22:11.320 --> 22:13.080
 is a long way down, that's New Zealand,

22:13.080 --> 22:14.440
 at 30% of the population.

22:14.440 --> 22:16.240
 So America's a long way ahead.

22:16.240 --> 22:18.880
 Why during the coronavirus era when we know

22:18.880 --> 22:23.480
 that obesity is the one clearest factor

22:23.480 --> 22:25.080
 that's likely to lead to your hospitalization

22:25.080 --> 22:26.720
 if you also get the virus?

22:26.720 --> 22:29.080
 Why did almost no public health information

22:29.080 --> 22:31.120
 in America focus on obesity?

22:31.120 --> 22:33.440
 80% of the people who ended up hospitalized

22:33.440 --> 22:36.840
 in America with coronavirus were obese.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.120
 We locked the schools when there was no evidence

22:41.120 --> 22:43.680
 that the coronavirus was deadly for children.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.800
 We all wore cloth masks when there was

22:45.800 --> 22:49.240
 a very little evidence that this was much use

22:49.240 --> 22:51.120
 in stopping the spread of the virus.

22:52.200 --> 22:55.160
 We had massive evidence about obesity being a problem,

22:55.160 --> 22:56.440
 and we never addressed it.

22:56.440 --> 22:57.280
 Why?

22:57.280 --> 22:58.960
 Is it just because we worried about fat people?

22:58.960 --> 23:01.800
 No, it's actually because about fat shaming, as it were.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.520
 No, it's also because to a great extent

23:03.520 --> 23:05.520
 it's a racial issue in America as well.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.640
 And actually I quoted this new publication

23:07.640 --> 23:10.200
 from the University of Chicago, as it happens,

23:10.200 --> 23:12.080
 which makes that claim explicit, says,

23:12.080 --> 23:15.440
 the reasons why people have views that are negative

23:15.440 --> 23:18.600
 about obesity is because of racism and slavery.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.200
 This is what everything is drawn back to in America.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.480
 Anything you want to stop, you say it's because of racism,

23:24.480 --> 23:25.760
 it's because of slavery.

23:25.760 --> 23:30.760
 How about it's actually because you mind

23:31.080 --> 23:32.480
 the hospitals getting clogged up,

23:32.480 --> 23:34.280
 you mind people dying,

23:34.280 --> 23:37.880
 you mind ethnic minorities disproportionately dying,

23:37.880 --> 23:39.200
 and you'd like to say something about it.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.000
 Once again, as in everything in America,

23:41.000 --> 23:46.000
 it's cut off by some poorly educated academic

23:46.320 --> 23:48.640
 saying it's about slavery.

23:48.640 --> 23:51.520
 So we're really not, I mean, this requires

23:51.520 --> 23:54.320
 a kind of form of brain surgery to perform it on a society,

23:54.320 --> 23:57.320
 probably one that's not possible without killing the patient.

23:57.320 --> 24:02.320
 And it's being done by people who are wearing mittens.

24:04.880 --> 24:09.600
 So I'm sure that there's a few folks listening to this

24:09.600 --> 24:12.200
 that are rolling their eyes and saying,

24:12.200 --> 24:16.960
 here we go again, two white guys talking about

24:16.960 --> 24:20.820
 the lack of institutional racism in America.

24:20.820 --> 24:25.820
 First of all, what would you like to tell them?

24:27.760 --> 24:31.980
 So our African American friends who are looking at this,

24:31.980 --> 24:34.500
 and I've gotten the chance to talk to a bunch of them

24:34.500 --> 24:35.820
 on Clubhouse recently.

24:35.820 --> 24:37.220
 Clubhouse is this social app.

24:37.220 --> 24:38.700
 And I really enjoy it.

24:38.700 --> 24:41.220
 It's an absolute zoo of an app as far as I can see it.

24:41.220 --> 24:44.540
 I personally love it because you get to talk to,

24:44.540 --> 24:48.020
 as somebody who's an introvert and doesn't socialize much,

24:48.020 --> 24:52.100
 I enjoy talking to people from all walks of life.

24:52.100 --> 24:55.020
 So it gave me a chance to first of all practice

24:55.020 --> 24:58.320
 Russian and Ukrainian, so I get the chance to do that.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.580
 Then you get a chance to talk about Israel and Palestine

25:00.580 --> 25:04.980
 with people who are from that part of the world.

25:04.980 --> 25:09.980
 And you get to hear raw emotion of people from the ground

25:10.180 --> 25:14.040
 where they start screaming, they start crying,

25:14.040 --> 25:16.940
 they start being calm and collected and thoughtful.

25:16.940 --> 25:20.460
 And this is as if you walked into a bar

25:20.460 --> 25:24.940
 with custom picked regular folks, in quotes, regular folks.

25:24.940 --> 25:29.180
 Just people that have, quote unquote, lived experiences.

25:29.180 --> 25:34.020
 Real pain, real hope, real emotions, biases,

25:34.020 --> 25:36.100
 and you get to listen to them go at it.

25:36.100 --> 25:39.700
 With no, because it's an audio app,

25:39.700 --> 25:41.460
 you're not allowed to start getting

25:41.460 --> 25:43.580
 into a physical fist fight.

25:43.580 --> 25:46.260
 So even though it really sounds like people want it.

25:46.260 --> 25:47.580
 It sounds like it's happening, yeah.

25:47.580 --> 25:50.180
 Yeah, and so you get to really listen to that feeling.

25:50.180 --> 25:53.500
 And for example, it allows a white guy like me

25:53.500 --> 25:55.380
 from another part of the world,

25:55.380 --> 25:58.320
 coming from the former Soviet Union,

25:58.320 --> 26:03.320
 to go into a room with a few hundred African Americans

26:03.500 --> 26:07.720
 screaming about Joe Rogan using the N word.

26:07.720 --> 26:09.100
 And I get to really listen.

26:09.100 --> 26:11.420
 There's very different perspectives on that

26:11.420 --> 26:13.180
 in the African American community,

26:13.180 --> 26:14.620
 and it's fascinating to listen.

26:14.620 --> 26:19.000
 So I don't get access to that by excellent books

26:19.000 --> 26:20.420
 and articles written and so on.

26:20.420 --> 26:22.300
 You get that real raw emotion.

26:22.300 --> 26:24.460
 And I'm just saying, there's a few of those folks

26:24.460 --> 26:27.700
 listening to this with that real raw emotion.

26:27.700 --> 26:32.700
 And one argument they say is you, Douglas Murray,

26:32.940 --> 26:35.260
 and you, Lex Freeman, don't have the right

26:36.180 --> 26:38.780
 to talk about race and racism in America.

26:38.780 --> 26:40.580
 It is our struggle.

26:40.580 --> 26:42.540
 You are from a privileged class of people

26:42.540 --> 26:47.540
 that don't know what it's like to be a black man

26:48.140 --> 26:51.140
 or woman in America walking down the street.

26:51.140 --> 26:52.920
 Can you steel man that case?

26:54.500 --> 26:55.780
 First of all, fuck that.

26:56.740 --> 27:01.120
 That's not, I think we need to define steel, steel manning.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.940
 Okay, I know what steel manning is.

27:04.940 --> 27:07.340
 I really resent that form of argumentation.

27:07.340 --> 27:08.180
 Sure.

27:08.180 --> 27:09.300
 I really resent it.

27:09.300 --> 27:11.800
 I have the right to talk about whatever the hell I want,

27:11.800 --> 27:14.700
 and no one's gonna stop me or try to intimidate me

27:14.700 --> 27:18.100
 or tell me that I can't simply because of my skin color.

27:18.100 --> 27:20.140
 And I think that if I said to somebody else

27:20.140 --> 27:23.340
 the other way around, it would be equally reprehensible.

27:23.340 --> 27:25.540
 If I said, shut up, you have no right

27:25.540 --> 27:27.420
 to criticize anything that Douglas Murray says

27:27.420 --> 27:29.940
 because you've not got my skin color.

27:29.940 --> 27:33.140
 Okay, it's not an exact comparison, but seriously,

27:33.140 --> 27:36.360
 is that a reasonable form of argument?

27:36.360 --> 27:37.500
 You haven't been through everything

27:37.500 --> 27:39.900
 I've been through in my life, therefore you can't comment.

27:39.900 --> 27:43.640
 No, in that case, nobody can talk about anything.

27:43.640 --> 27:47.260
 We might as well pack up, go home, and isolate ourselves.

27:47.260 --> 27:49.980
 Strong words, but can you try to steel man the case,

27:49.980 --> 27:51.320
 not in this particular situation,

27:51.320 --> 27:56.060
 but there's people that have lived through something

27:57.200 --> 27:59.100
 that can comment in a very specific way,

27:59.100 --> 28:00.860
 like for example, Holocaust survivors.

28:00.860 --> 28:01.700
 Yes.

28:03.180 --> 28:07.660
 There is a sense in which, maybe a basic sense of civility

28:07.660 --> 28:10.140
 when a Holocaust survivor is speaking about

28:10.140 --> 28:12.240
 their experience of the Holocaust,

28:12.240 --> 28:17.220
 then an intellectual from a very different part of the world

28:17.220 --> 28:22.220
 is simply writing about nuanced geopolitics of World War II

28:23.040 --> 28:26.780
 just should not interrupt the Holocaust survivor.

28:26.780 --> 28:27.940
 We physically interrupt them

28:27.940 --> 28:28.780
 if they're telling their stories.

28:28.780 --> 28:32.060
 No, with words, with logic and reason

28:32.060 --> 28:34.340
 that the experience of the Holocaust survivor

28:34.340 --> 28:38.220
 somehow fundamentally has a deeper understanding

28:38.220 --> 28:42.220
 of the humanity and the injustice of the.

28:42.220 --> 28:45.100
 First of all, again, we're in even deeper waters now,

28:45.100 --> 28:48.460
 but in terms of wanting to listen to another person

28:48.460 --> 28:52.700
 who has experienced something, yes, yes.

28:52.700 --> 28:56.540
 But not endlessly, not endlessly.

28:56.540 --> 28:58.340
 I mean, there are some people who've written about,

28:58.340 --> 29:00.060
 I mean, there are people who've written about the Holocaust

29:00.060 --> 29:02.300
 who didn't experience the Holocaust

29:02.300 --> 29:04.940
 and have written about it better than people who did.

29:05.900 --> 29:09.840
 It's not this idea that the lived experience

29:09.840 --> 29:12.260
 to use this terrible modern jargon

29:12.260 --> 29:14.060
 as if there's another type.

29:14.060 --> 29:16.340
 This idea that the lived experience

29:16.340 --> 29:20.680
 has to triumph over everything else is not always correct.

29:20.680 --> 29:23.720
 It can be correct in some circumstances.

29:23.720 --> 29:26.260
 If you are sitting in a room with a Holocaust survivor

29:26.260 --> 29:28.620
 and somebody who'd never heard about the Holocaust

29:28.620 --> 29:32.620
 and wanted to kind of shoot out their views on it, yeah,

29:32.620 --> 29:34.740
 one of those people should be heard more than the other,

29:34.740 --> 29:36.280
 obviously, obviously.

29:37.260 --> 29:40.060
 If there's somebody who's experienced racism firsthand

29:40.060 --> 29:42.980
 and there's somebody else who has never experienced it,

29:42.980 --> 29:45.340
 then obviously you'd want to hear from the person

29:45.340 --> 29:47.540
 who has experienced it firsthand,

29:47.540 --> 29:49.740
 if that is the discussion underway.

29:51.980 --> 29:53.900
 I don't think that it's the case

29:53.900 --> 29:55.980
 that that is endlessly the case.

29:55.980 --> 29:59.660
 I'm also highly reluctant to concede

29:59.660 --> 30:00.940
 that there are groups of people

30:00.940 --> 30:05.220
 who by dint of their skin color or anything else

30:05.220 --> 30:07.100
 get to dominate the microphone.

30:07.100 --> 30:08.340
 Now, of course, we're literally both speaking

30:08.340 --> 30:10.660
 to microphones at the moment, so there's an irony to this,

30:10.660 --> 30:12.620
 but let's skate over the irony.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.620
 What I mean is people saying,

30:15.620 --> 30:17.620
 you don't have the right to speak,

30:17.620 --> 30:19.700
 I have the right to take the microphone from you

30:19.700 --> 30:22.180
 and speak because I know best.

30:22.180 --> 30:26.340
 Fine, if you know best, we'll argue it out

30:26.340 --> 30:29.100
 and someone will win, long or short term.

30:30.460 --> 30:35.460
 But the almost aggressive tone

30:36.100 --> 30:39.500
 in which this is now leveled, I don't like the sound of,

30:40.380 --> 30:43.660
 nobody's experience is completely understandable

30:43.660 --> 30:46.580
 by another human being, nobody's.

30:46.580 --> 30:49.300
 And what many people are asking us to do at the moment,

30:49.300 --> 30:52.500
 us collectively is, to fall for that thing,

30:52.500 --> 30:54.780
 I think it was Camille Foster who said it first,

30:54.780 --> 30:57.260
 but I've adopted in recent years,

30:57.260 --> 31:00.540
 is to say you must spend an inordinate amount of your life

31:00.540 --> 31:03.420
 trying to understand me personally,

31:03.420 --> 31:06.340
 my lived experience, everything about me.

31:06.340 --> 31:10.540
 You should dedicate your life to trying to do that.

31:10.540 --> 31:13.580
 Simultaneously, you'll never understand me.

31:15.060 --> 31:17.180
 This is not an attractive invitation.

31:17.180 --> 31:20.860
 This is an unwinnable game.

31:20.860 --> 31:24.860
 So if somebody has a legitimate

31:26.580 --> 31:29.580
 and important point to make, they should make it

31:29.580 --> 31:31.220
 and they'll win through whatever their character is

31:31.220 --> 31:32.060
 or whatever their race.

31:32.060 --> 31:33.780
 And by the way, there are plenty of white people

31:33.780 --> 31:35.620
 who experience racism as well.

31:35.620 --> 31:38.980
 There are plenty of white people who do and have done,

31:38.980 --> 31:40.980
 and increasingly so, which is one of the things

31:40.980 --> 31:42.740
 I write about in the War on the West.

31:42.740 --> 31:45.740
 I mean, I would argue that today in America,

31:45.740 --> 31:47.340
 the only group who are actually allowed

31:47.340 --> 31:52.020
 to be consistently, vilely racist against the white people.

31:52.020 --> 31:54.660
 If you say disgusting things about black people

31:54.660 --> 31:57.500
 in America in 2022, you will be over.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.980
 You will be over.

31:59.980 --> 32:02.980
 If you decide to talk about people's white tears,

32:02.980 --> 32:05.980
 their white female tears, their white guilt,

32:05.980 --> 32:08.580
 their white privilege, their white rage,

32:08.580 --> 32:11.980
 and all these other pseudo pathologizing terms,

32:11.980 --> 32:12.900
 you'll be just fine.

32:12.900 --> 32:14.260
 You can be the chairman of the Joint Committee

32:14.260 --> 32:16.980
 of the Staff, you can lecture at Yale University,

32:16.980 --> 32:20.500
 absolutely fine, and the white people have to suck that up

32:20.500 --> 32:23.300
 as if that's fine because there was racism

32:23.300 --> 32:24.620
 in another direction in the past.

32:24.620 --> 32:27.180
 So white people can have racism as well.

32:27.180 --> 32:28.940
 Does that mean that I think that I have a right

32:28.940 --> 32:31.340
 or other white people have a right to dominate the discourse

32:31.340 --> 32:34.780
 by talking about their feelings of having been victims

32:34.780 --> 32:35.780
 of racism?

32:35.780 --> 32:38.060
 No, not particularly, because what does that get us?

32:38.060 --> 32:41.860
 It gets us into an endless cycle of competitive victimhood.

32:41.860 --> 32:44.860
 Am I saying that white people who've experienced violence

32:44.860 --> 32:48.100
 have experienced historically anything like the violence

32:48.100 --> 32:49.780
 that was perpetrated against black people

32:49.780 --> 32:51.180
 in America historically?

32:51.180 --> 32:52.540
 Obviously not.

32:52.540 --> 32:57.540
 But what kind of competition do we want to enter here?

32:58.780 --> 33:03.300
 And this is very, very important terrain now in America,

33:03.300 --> 33:05.220
 because there's one other thing I have to throw in there,

33:05.220 --> 33:09.220
 which is how do you work out the sincerity of the claim?

33:09.220 --> 33:12.540
 How do you work out the sincerity of the claim being made?

33:12.540 --> 33:14.980
 At one point in this latest book,

33:14.980 --> 33:19.060
 I referred to a very useful bit in Nietzsche

33:19.060 --> 33:20.660
 on the genealogy of morals,

33:21.660 --> 33:24.380
 where, as you know, Nietzsche always has to be treated

33:24.380 --> 33:26.340
 carefully, you know, when people say,

33:26.340 --> 33:29.460
 I love Nietzsche, you have to say, which bits?

33:29.460 --> 33:33.820
 So what exactly do you love about him?

33:34.820 --> 33:35.660
 But,

33:35.660 --> 33:38.660
 and a lot can be learned from the answer.

33:38.660 --> 33:40.980
 But there are moments in Genealogy of Morals

33:40.980 --> 33:42.980
 that were very useful for this book.

33:42.980 --> 33:45.900
 One of them was the moment when Nietzsche uses a phrase

33:45.900 --> 33:48.260
 that I've now stolen from myself, appropriated,

33:48.260 --> 33:49.100
 you might say,

33:50.540 --> 33:55.540
 where he refers to people who tear at wounds

33:55.540 --> 33:59.540
 long since closed and then cry about the pain they feel.

33:59.540 --> 34:01.020
 And Nietzsche says,

34:01.020 --> 34:03.900
 I've never felt so much pain in my life

34:03.900 --> 34:05.820
 as the pain they feel.

34:08.140 --> 34:10.900
 Now, how do you know,

34:10.900 --> 34:13.380
 how do you know whether the pain is real?

34:14.500 --> 34:15.940
 How do you know?

34:15.940 --> 34:20.780
 I'm not saying you can never know, but it's hard.

34:20.780 --> 34:22.180
 So when somebody says,

34:22.180 --> 34:24.180
 I feel that my life hasn't gone that well

34:24.180 --> 34:25.700
 and it's because of something that was done

34:25.700 --> 34:28.300
 to my ancestors 200 years ago,

34:28.300 --> 34:30.380
 maybe they do feel that.

34:30.380 --> 34:32.660
 Maybe they're right to feel that.

34:32.660 --> 34:34.580
 Maybe they're using it up.

34:34.580 --> 34:37.980
 Maybe they're using it as their reason for failure in life.

34:37.980 --> 34:41.500
 Maybe they're using it as their reason to not even try.

34:41.500 --> 34:42.780
 Maybe they're using it as their reason

34:42.780 --> 34:45.620
 to smoke weed all day.

34:45.620 --> 34:46.900
 I don't know.

34:46.900 --> 34:47.740
 And who does know?

34:47.740 --> 34:49.620
 How can you work that out?

34:49.620 --> 34:51.420
 And that's why I come back to this thing of,

34:51.420 --> 34:55.180
 who are we to constantly judge in this society

34:55.180 --> 34:57.620
 other people who we don't know

34:57.620 --> 35:01.620
 and attribute motives to them based on racial

35:01.620 --> 35:02.660
 characteristics?

35:03.860 --> 35:05.580
 And as you write in this part,

35:07.140 --> 35:10.700
 I like your cultural appropriation of Nietzsche

35:11.900 --> 35:14.900
 and at the same time, canceling Nietzsche

35:16.260 --> 35:17.820
 in the same set of sentences.

35:17.820 --> 35:20.500
 But you write in this part about evil.

35:20.500 --> 35:22.580
 No, I didn't cancel Nietzsche.

35:22.580 --> 35:23.420
 Well.

35:23.420 --> 35:27.100
 Can't cancel Nietzsche, I was saying treat him carefully.

35:27.100 --> 35:29.660
 Treat him carefully, fair enough.

35:29.660 --> 35:31.820
 But you can judge a man's character

35:31.820 --> 35:35.060
 by which parts of Nietzsche he quotes.

35:35.060 --> 35:36.540
 That's fair enough, I think.

35:36.540 --> 35:38.540
 I think when you meet people who do man and Superman

35:38.540 --> 35:39.860
 a bit too much, you're in.

35:42.140 --> 35:45.300
 Now you're pulling in even deeper water

35:45.300 --> 35:47.100
 referencing Hitler here.

35:47.100 --> 35:48.460
 Okay.

35:48.460 --> 35:51.100
 So you write in this part of the book about evil.

35:53.220 --> 35:57.260
 Quote, what is it that drives evil?

35:57.260 --> 35:58.500
 Many things without doubt,

35:58.500 --> 36:00.580
 but one of them is identified by several

36:00.580 --> 36:04.420
 of the great philosophers is resentment.

36:04.420 --> 36:06.580
 That sentiment is one of the greatest drivers

36:06.580 --> 36:09.420
 for people who want to destroy.

36:09.420 --> 36:12.180
 Colon, blaming someone else for having something

36:12.180 --> 36:14.180
 you believe you deserve more.

36:14.180 --> 36:17.500
 And you're saying this kind of resentment,

36:17.500 --> 36:21.180
 we don't know as it surfaces whether it's genuine

36:21.180 --> 36:25.740
 or if it's used to sort of play games of power

36:25.740 --> 36:30.740
 to evil ends, can you speak to this?

36:32.460 --> 36:34.740
 Because it's such a fascinating idea

36:34.740 --> 36:37.980
 that one of the biggest drivers of evil

36:37.980 --> 36:41.420
 in the world is resentment.

36:41.420 --> 36:43.940
 Because if you look at, boy,

36:43.940 --> 36:47.300
 if you look at human history, if you look at Hitler,

36:47.300 --> 36:49.700
 so much of the propaganda, so much of the narrative

36:49.700 --> 36:51.100
 was about resentment.

36:52.100 --> 36:54.020
 So is that surface or is it level

36:54.020 --> 36:56.180
 or is that deep, the resentment that drives evil?

36:56.180 --> 36:58.180
 It can be any of the above.

36:58.180 --> 37:01.580
 Let's first of all preface it, everybody has resentment.

37:01.580 --> 37:06.140
 I use the term resentment which is sort of very similar

37:06.140 --> 37:08.260
 to resentment, let's stick with resentment.

37:09.540 --> 37:11.260
 So we don't sound too pretentious.

37:17.460 --> 37:18.780
 Let me give you a quick example of somebody

37:18.780 --> 37:21.780
 in our own day who has a form of resentment,

37:21.780 --> 37:22.660
 Vladimir Putin.

37:22.660 --> 37:26.420
 Did you see Navalny's documentary, Putin's Palace?

37:26.420 --> 37:27.260
 Yes.

37:27.260 --> 37:28.100
 Yeah.

37:28.100 --> 37:29.780
 You remember the stuff about Putin

37:29.780 --> 37:32.780
 as a young KGB officer in Germany?

37:32.780 --> 37:34.740
 Remember the stuff about Putin and his first wife's

37:34.740 --> 37:37.020
 resentment of one of his KGB colleagues

37:37.020 --> 37:40.100
 who had an apartment that was a few meters bigger

37:40.100 --> 37:41.900
 than the Putin's apartment?

37:42.900 --> 37:43.740
 Yeah.

37:43.740 --> 37:44.820
 It's very interesting.

37:44.820 --> 37:47.220
 And by the way, I'm not saying that, you know,

37:47.220 --> 37:48.820
 Vladimir Putin became the man he has become

37:48.820 --> 37:50.820
 and invaded Ukraine because he didn't have an apartment

37:50.820 --> 37:53.420
 he liked in Berlin or Munich or wherever he was.

37:53.420 --> 37:55.180
 There's distinct possibility.

37:55.180 --> 38:00.180
 My point is that resentment is a factor in all human lives

38:02.220 --> 38:05.140
 and we all feel it in our lives

38:05.140 --> 38:08.380
 and it's something that has to be struggled against.

38:09.380 --> 38:13.020
 Resentment is, in political terms, can be a deadly,

38:13.020 --> 38:15.660
 I mean, it's an incredibly deep thing to draw upon.

38:16.860 --> 38:18.060
 I mean, you mentioned Hitler.

38:18.060 --> 38:20.060
 Obviously one of the things that Hitler

38:20.060 --> 38:22.980
 played on was resentment, obviously.

38:24.540 --> 38:27.060
 Almost every revolutionary does.

38:27.060 --> 38:28.980
 I mean, the French revolutionaries did as well.

38:28.980 --> 38:30.620
 And not without cause.

38:31.620 --> 38:33.900
 It's a good reason to feel that Versailles

38:33.900 --> 38:38.020
 was not listening to Paris in the 1780s

38:38.020 --> 38:41.700
 and feel resentment for Marie Antoinette

38:41.700 --> 38:44.220
 in her palace within the palace,

38:44.220 --> 38:47.380
 ignoring the bread shortages in Paris.

38:47.380 --> 38:51.380
 So resentment is a very, it's a very understandable thing

38:51.380 --> 38:53.180
 and sometimes it's justifiable

38:53.180 --> 38:57.300
 and it's also deadly to the person as it is to the society.

38:57.300 --> 38:59.980
 It's an incredibly deep, deep sentiment.

38:59.980 --> 39:03.260
 Somebody else has got something that you should have.

39:04.460 --> 39:07.540
 And the problem about it is that it has the potential

39:07.540 --> 39:08.460
 to be endless.

39:09.460 --> 39:11.460
 You can do it your whole life.

39:11.460 --> 39:14.540
 And one of the ways I've sort of found myself

39:14.540 --> 39:15.860
 explaining this to people is to say,

39:15.860 --> 39:18.180
 it's also important to recognize that resentment

39:18.180 --> 39:21.180
 is something that can cross absolutely every boundary.

39:22.060 --> 39:26.420
 So for instance, it crosses all racial boundaries, obviously,

39:26.420 --> 39:28.180
 and how it goes without saying.

39:28.180 --> 39:30.660
 More interesting is it crosses all class boundaries

39:30.660 --> 39:32.420
 and socioeconomic boundaries.

39:33.380 --> 39:36.060
 And if I was to sort of simplify this thought,

39:36.060 --> 39:39.500
 I would say, I guess that you and I

39:39.500 --> 39:44.500
 and everybody watching knows or has known something

39:44.500 --> 39:47.820
 or has known somebody in their lives

39:47.820 --> 39:52.820
 who has almost nothing in worldly terms

39:53.540 --> 39:57.020
 and is a generous person, a kindly person,

39:57.020 --> 40:02.020
 a giving person, a happy person even, a cheerful person.

40:03.300 --> 40:06.460
 And I think we probably have also,

40:06.460 --> 40:07.900
 or many of us will have met people

40:07.900 --> 40:09.300
 who seem to have everything

40:09.300 --> 40:13.300
 and who are filled with resentment, filled with resentment.

40:13.300 --> 40:14.940
 Somebody else has held them back from something.

40:14.940 --> 40:16.580
 Their sister once did something,

40:16.580 --> 40:19.860
 she got this and I should have got that.

40:19.860 --> 40:22.020
 And on and on and on.

40:22.020 --> 40:23.660
 It's a human trait.

40:23.660 --> 40:26.780
 And one of the things that suggests to me

40:26.780 --> 40:29.340
 is that we therefore have a choice in our lives about this.

40:29.340 --> 40:32.020
 And this is something which we can do something about,

40:32.020 --> 40:35.900
 not limitlessly, but for instance,

40:35.900 --> 40:37.700
 I mean, there are very good reasons

40:37.700 --> 40:41.060
 that some people in their lives might feel resentment.

40:41.060 --> 40:44.020
 Let's say you're involved in a car crash

40:44.020 --> 40:46.500
 and a friend fell asleep at the wheel

40:46.500 --> 40:48.700
 and that's why you are spending the rest of your life

40:48.700 --> 40:50.100
 in a wheelchair.

40:50.100 --> 40:51.420
 It's a pertinent example of this

40:51.420 --> 40:53.260
 in American politics at the moment.

40:55.500 --> 40:58.100
 You would be justified in feeling resentment.

40:58.980 --> 41:01.020
 And at some point you have to make a decision,

41:01.020 --> 41:08.020
 which is, am I going to be that person or a different person?

41:08.020 --> 41:10.500
 But even in that case, you're saying at the individual level

41:10.500 --> 41:13.180
 and at the societal level is destructive to the mind,

41:13.180 --> 41:15.500
 even when you're, quote unquote, justified.

41:15.500 --> 41:16.820
 It rots you.

41:16.820 --> 41:21.340
 It rots you because the best you can do

41:21.340 --> 41:25.100
 is to eke out your days unfulfilled.

41:26.540 --> 41:29.460
 So the antidote, as you describe, is gratitude.

41:29.460 --> 41:31.100
 Yes.

41:31.100 --> 41:35.660
 Gratitude is the antidote to evil in a sense.

41:35.660 --> 41:38.340
 Gratitude is the individual level and the societal level.

41:38.340 --> 41:40.700
 Gratitude is certainly the answer to resentment.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.700
 I quote in The War on the West,

41:44.700 --> 41:46.940
 when I read it the first time a few years ago,

41:46.940 --> 41:51.220
 I was absolutely floored by the brothers Karamazov.

41:52.420 --> 41:53.460
 Not everything in it, by the way,

41:53.460 --> 41:54.500
 and I won't get into it,

41:54.500 --> 41:58.060
 but I have some very big structural criticisms

41:58.060 --> 41:59.620
 of the novel.

41:59.620 --> 42:01.500
 Now you're just sweet talking to me

42:01.500 --> 42:04.860
 because I'm a Dostoevsky fan, but I appreciate this.

42:04.860 --> 42:06.220
 Oh, okay.

42:06.220 --> 42:07.660
 Well, we could get into what I see

42:07.660 --> 42:09.500
 as being the structural flaws in the brothers Karamazov,

42:09.500 --> 42:10.340
 but anyway.

42:10.340 --> 42:12.220
 Now I'm offended and triggered.

42:12.220 --> 42:17.020
 Yeah, no, I mean, this is something coming out of Macbeth

42:17.020 --> 42:19.060
 and saying, I didn't think it was much good.

42:19.060 --> 42:20.740
 Yeah, there's structural flaws.

42:20.740 --> 42:23.060
 Yeah, I thought the ending stank

42:23.060 --> 42:24.620
 and the middle wasn't very good.

42:24.620 --> 42:28.100
 No, when I read that novel,

42:28.100 --> 42:30.020
 I was floored by a couple of things.

42:30.020 --> 42:32.100
 One is, of course, at the moment

42:32.100 --> 42:33.940
 where we realize the devil appears.

42:34.860 --> 42:37.380
 The moment that Ivan says to his brother,

42:37.380 --> 42:39.340
 you know he visits me,

42:39.340 --> 42:41.900
 and you realize that he's talking about the devil,

42:41.900 --> 42:46.900
 the whole novel goes into this totally different space.

42:47.580 --> 42:49.060
 Anyway, it's even more

42:49.060 --> 42:51.660
 than you've already realized the novel's about.

42:51.660 --> 42:54.540
 And then when the conversation occurs between Ivan

42:54.540 --> 42:57.860
 and the devil, I think he describes him

42:57.860 --> 43:01.460
 as dressed in the French style

43:02.860 --> 43:06.060
 of the early part of the 90th century.

43:06.060 --> 43:07.700
 Very strange that the devil would be dressed like that,

43:07.700 --> 43:08.540
 but sort of.

43:10.820 --> 43:13.620
 And if you remember that he's sort of cross legged

43:13.620 --> 43:15.060
 and rather a vain figure,

43:16.100 --> 43:19.580
 but the devil mentions in passing to Ivan

43:19.580 --> 43:22.300
 that he says, I don't know why,

43:22.300 --> 43:27.300
 gratitude is not an instinct that's been given to me.

43:30.980 --> 43:32.180
 Yeah, you're not allowed.

43:32.180 --> 43:35.860
 This is not, given the role of being the devil,

43:35.860 --> 43:37.260
 this is not one of the things.

43:37.260 --> 43:38.100
 Just not one of the things.

43:38.100 --> 43:39.260
 And you think, and of course,

43:39.260 --> 43:42.060
 only a genius of Dostoevsky's stature could,

43:42.060 --> 43:45.100
 I mean, a lesser genius would have made a whole novel

43:45.100 --> 43:46.180
 out of that insight.

43:47.060 --> 43:49.300
 Only Dostoevsky can just throw it away

43:49.300 --> 43:51.420
 because there's such an abundance of riches

43:51.420 --> 43:53.500
 that he still has to get through,

43:53.500 --> 43:55.300
 the structural problems aside.

43:55.300 --> 43:58.820
 But the, but the, but the.

43:58.820 --> 44:02.140
 The passive aggressive, the microaggression

44:02.140 --> 44:04.420
 in this conversation is palpable.

44:04.420 --> 44:07.700
 A little knife fight.

44:07.700 --> 44:09.940
 No, but the reason I mention this is because of course,

44:09.940 --> 44:13.460
 when I saw this, this is such a brilliant insight

44:13.460 --> 44:16.940
 by Dostoevsky because why would gratitude

44:16.940 --> 44:19.900
 not be a sentiment that the devil was capable of?

44:19.900 --> 44:22.820
 The answer is of course that if the devil

44:22.820 --> 44:25.980
 was capable of gratitude, he wouldn't be the devil.

44:25.980 --> 44:27.140
 He'd be somebody else.

44:28.740 --> 44:31.460
 He has to be incapable of gratitude.

44:31.460 --> 44:35.460
 Do you think for Dostoevsky that was as strong of an insight

44:35.460 --> 44:36.700
 as it is for you?

44:36.700 --> 44:39.460
 Because I think that's a really powerful idea

44:39.460 --> 44:43.860
 that with gratitude, you don't get the resentment

44:43.860 --> 44:46.100
 that rots you from the core.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.900
 Yes, I think it was one of the just endless things

44:48.900 --> 44:50.820
 that he saw in us.

44:50.820 --> 44:54.020
 And the way I put it is that, I mean,

44:54.020 --> 44:57.940
 I also think of it in terms of the era of deconstruction,

44:57.940 --> 44:59.500
 which is one of the things I'd like us to call

44:59.500 --> 45:00.980
 the era that's now ending.

45:02.420 --> 45:05.940
 The era of deconstruction was the era that started,

45:05.940 --> 45:08.380
 let's say from the 60s onwards,

45:08.380 --> 45:11.740
 and was originally an academic game

45:11.740 --> 45:13.740
 that then spilled out into the wider culture,

45:13.740 --> 45:16.980
 which was let's take everything apart.

45:16.980 --> 45:19.540
 Let's pull it all apart.

45:19.540 --> 45:20.900
 There are lots of problems with it.

45:20.900 --> 45:22.220
 One is it's quite boring.

45:23.100 --> 45:25.660
 You don't get an awful lot from it.

45:27.860 --> 45:30.780
 You also have the problem of what children find

45:30.780 --> 45:32.540
 when they try to do this with bicycles,

45:32.540 --> 45:34.420
 which is they can take it apart quite easily,

45:34.420 --> 45:36.180
 but they can't put it back together.

45:38.100 --> 45:43.100
 And the era of taking things apart as a game

45:45.220 --> 45:46.220
 is one we've lived through,

45:46.220 --> 45:48.180
 and it's been highly destructive,

45:48.180 --> 45:50.580
 but you can do it for quite a long time.

45:51.540 --> 45:53.100
 I'm going to look at this society,

45:53.100 --> 45:56.620
 and I'm going to take it apart by showing systemic problems.

45:56.620 --> 46:00.380
 I'm going to, at the end of that, what have you got?

46:00.380 --> 46:01.220
 What have you done?

46:01.220 --> 46:03.140
 What have you achieved?

46:03.140 --> 46:05.460
 We need to interrogate this.

46:05.460 --> 46:06.500
 Okay, interrogate.

46:06.500 --> 46:07.420
 By all means, ask questions,

46:07.420 --> 46:11.140
 but interrogate as a deliberate hostility to this.

46:11.140 --> 46:13.340
 I'm going to interrogate this thing and take it apart.

46:13.340 --> 46:17.020
 And again, at the end of it, what have you got?

46:17.020 --> 46:21.180
 Whether you're interrogating a text or a piece of music

46:21.180 --> 46:24.540
 or an idea or a society, fine.

46:24.540 --> 46:26.300
 Question, endlessly question.

46:26.300 --> 46:31.300
 Yes, interrogate assumes it's all a criminal in a cell

46:33.540 --> 46:37.660
 and it's guilty, and therefore it must be taken apart.

46:37.660 --> 46:41.180
 And that's what we've been doing for decades in the West.

46:41.180 --> 46:43.780
 And that's resentment.

46:43.780 --> 46:46.180
 That's one byproduct of resentment.

46:46.180 --> 46:49.540
 You can't build the thing, but you know how to take it apart.

46:50.980 --> 46:53.500
 Is a little bit of resentment good?

46:53.500 --> 46:56.940
 So you have that, I love Tom Waits,

46:56.940 --> 47:00.220
 and he has a song where a little drop of,

47:00.220 --> 47:03.020
 I like my Tom with a little drop of poison.

47:03.020 --> 47:05.060
 Is it good to do that?

47:05.060 --> 47:08.300
 Is it good to have a little bit of poison in your drink?

47:08.300 --> 47:09.620
 Depends what the poison is,

47:09.620 --> 47:12.180
 and it depends if you know not to have another drink.

47:13.700 --> 47:16.140
 It might be the case, you find out, as some alcoholics do,

47:16.140 --> 47:19.820
 that one was too many and 10 is not enough.

47:21.140 --> 47:25.020
 So there's a natural, in this case,

47:25.020 --> 47:27.820
 this kind of deconstruction is a slippery slope.

47:27.820 --> 47:29.820
 It becomes an addiction, it becomes a drug,

47:29.820 --> 47:31.100
 and you just can't stop.

47:31.100 --> 47:32.900
 Well, you'd have to wean yourself off it

47:32.900 --> 47:34.620
 and try to start creating again.

47:34.620 --> 47:39.620
 You'd have to start trying to put things together again.

47:40.420 --> 47:45.180
 Something I think might be in the throes of starting

47:45.180 --> 47:46.020
 as it happens.

47:46.900 --> 47:51.340
 Well, speaking of taking things apart

47:51.340 --> 47:53.460
 and not putting them together again,

47:53.460 --> 47:55.640
 the idea of critical race theory.

47:58.180 --> 48:02.220
 Can you, to me, explain, so I'm an engineer

48:02.220 --> 48:05.060
 and have not been actually paying attention much,

48:05.060 --> 48:07.460
 unfortunately, to these things.

48:07.460 --> 48:08.780
 None of the people in your field were

48:08.780 --> 48:11.180
 until it comes along and smacks you in the face.

48:11.180 --> 48:16.180
 I've had that line of thinking from MIT.

48:17.620 --> 48:22.060
 I said, well, surely whatever you folks are busy about

48:22.060 --> 48:26.100
 yelling at each other for is a thing at Harvard and Yale.

48:26.100 --> 48:26.980
 It's not going to.

48:26.980 --> 48:28.820
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

48:28.820 --> 48:31.420
 People in the STEM subjects thought it's not coming for us.

48:31.420 --> 48:33.700
 It can't come to us and bang.

48:33.700 --> 48:36.660
 Well, it hasn't quite been a bang.

48:36.660 --> 48:37.500
 I'm not sure.

48:37.500 --> 48:39.580
 Engineering is more safe than others.

48:39.580 --> 48:43.000
 Yeah, so let's draw a line now

48:43.000 --> 48:45.380
 between engineering and science.

48:45.380 --> 48:48.220
 So I think engineering is,

48:48.220 --> 48:51.940
 I'm sitting in a castle in the tallest tower

48:51.940 --> 48:55.260
 with my pinky out drinking my martini saying, surely.

48:56.140 --> 49:00.620
 The peasants below with their biology and their humanities

49:00.620 --> 49:02.400
 will figure it all out.

49:02.400 --> 49:03.240
 No, I'm just kidding.

49:03.240 --> 49:04.400
 There's no pinky out.

49:04.400 --> 49:07.420
 I drink vodka and I hang with the peasants.

49:07.420 --> 49:08.260
 Okay, where is this?

49:08.260 --> 49:09.860
 This metaphor has gone too far.

49:11.620 --> 49:14.460
 Can you explain to this engineer

49:14.460 --> 49:16.420
 what critical race theory is?

49:16.420 --> 49:19.460
 Is it a term that's definable?

49:19.460 --> 49:20.780
 Is there a tradition?

49:20.780 --> 49:21.620
 Is there a history?

49:21.620 --> 49:24.260
 What is good about it, what is bad about it?

49:24.260 --> 49:25.100
 It is a tradition.

49:25.100 --> 49:25.940
 It is a history.

49:25.940 --> 49:26.760
 It's a school of thought.

49:26.760 --> 49:30.220
 It started in the law roughly in the 1970s

49:30.220 --> 49:31.820
 in some of the American academy.

49:32.740 --> 49:33.740
 It spilled out.

49:33.740 --> 49:36.780
 It always aimed to be an activist philosophy.

49:36.780 --> 49:38.080
 People deny that now,

49:38.080 --> 49:40.420
 but as I cite in The War in the West,

49:40.420 --> 49:43.100
 the foundational texts say as much.

49:43.100 --> 49:48.100
 This is an activist academic study.

49:48.280 --> 49:50.660
 We're not just looking at the law.

49:50.660 --> 49:52.240
 We seek to change the law.

49:53.620 --> 49:56.260
 And it's built out into all of the other disciplines.

49:56.260 --> 49:57.660
 I think there's a reason for that, by the way,

49:57.660 --> 49:58.820
 which is it happened at the time

49:58.820 --> 50:00.500
 that the humanities and others in America

50:00.500 --> 50:03.660
 were increasingly weak and didn't know what to do,

50:03.660 --> 50:06.820
 and they needed more games to play or new games to play.

50:07.820 --> 50:09.420
 The psychologists got bored.

50:09.420 --> 50:12.780
 Yeah, I mean, well, they needed tenure.

50:12.780 --> 50:14.620
 They needed something to do.

50:14.620 --> 50:16.900
 And I mean, it's not an original observation.

50:16.900 --> 50:17.780
 Plenty of people have made this,

50:17.780 --> 50:19.740
 but I mean, Neil Ferguson said it some time ago,

50:19.740 --> 50:23.420
 for instance, that in the last 50 years

50:23.420 --> 50:26.420
 in American academia, certainly in humanities departments,

50:26.420 --> 50:29.980
 when somebody dies out who's a great scholar in something,

50:29.980 --> 50:33.340
 that's just not replaced by somebody of equal stature.

50:33.340 --> 50:36.100
 They're replaced by somebody who does theory

50:36.100 --> 50:38.100
 or critical race theory.

50:38.100 --> 50:41.580
 They're replaced by somebody who does the modern games.

50:41.580 --> 50:44.500
 Somebody dies out who's a great historian of, say,

50:44.500 --> 50:46.960
 I don't know, it's the one that's on my mind,

50:46.960 --> 50:48.740
 Russian history or Russian literature,

50:48.740 --> 50:53.180
 and they're not replaced by a similar scholar.

50:53.180 --> 50:57.660
 In his observation and in yours, is this a recent development?

50:57.660 --> 50:59.940
 It's happened in the last few decades, for sure.

50:59.940 --> 51:01.500
 And it's sped up.

51:01.500 --> 51:02.940
 Is it because we've gotten to the bottom

51:02.940 --> 51:04.960
 of some of the biggest questions of history?

51:04.960 --> 51:08.300
 No, it's because we're willing to forget the big questions.

51:09.300 --> 51:12.180
 Because it's more fun to, big questions aren't as fun?

51:12.180 --> 51:15.460
 No, partly it's, no, I should stress that partly isn't,

51:15.460 --> 51:17.620
 this is in the weeds, but partly it's a result

51:17.620 --> 51:19.940
 of the hyper specialization in academia.

51:19.940 --> 51:24.780
 You know, if you said you'd like to write

51:24.780 --> 51:26.760
 your dissertation on Hobbes,

51:31.460 --> 51:36.460
 if you wanted to say something central

51:36.660 --> 51:41.660
 to Kant's thought or Hegel's, I mean, that's not popular.

51:42.780 --> 51:45.920
 What's popular is to take somebody way down the line

51:45.920 --> 51:47.320
 from that, because there's a feeling

51:47.320 --> 51:49.960
 that that's all been done.

51:49.960 --> 51:52.420
 So you take something way, way, way down the line

51:52.420 --> 51:54.220
 from that that's much less important,

51:54.220 --> 51:56.020
 and then you sort of play with that.

51:57.180 --> 51:58.920
 And I think most people, anyone who's watching

51:58.920 --> 52:00.980
 who's been in a philosophy department

52:00.980 --> 52:04.340
 or anything else in recent years will know that tendency.

52:04.340 --> 52:06.900
 By the way, there's a very practical consequence of this.

52:06.900 --> 52:09.020
 I saw this at the end of my friend Roger Scruton's life

52:09.020 --> 52:12.420
 when he would occasionally, he didn't get tenure

52:12.420 --> 52:15.660
 at universities, but he would occasionally be flown in

52:15.660 --> 52:18.220
 even by his enemies to teach courses

52:18.220 --> 52:20.980
 in various universities in basics of philosophy,

52:20.980 --> 52:24.380
 because there was no one in the department able to do it.

52:24.380 --> 52:28.540
 Like he would go in and teach for a semester,

52:29.500 --> 52:34.020
 you know, Hegel and Kant and Schopenhauer and others,

52:34.020 --> 52:36.120
 because there was no one to do it,

52:36.120 --> 52:38.100
 because they were all playing with the things

52:38.100 --> 52:40.620
 way, way, way down the road from this.

52:40.620 --> 52:42.940
 So that had already happened,

52:42.940 --> 52:45.240
 and people were searching for new games to play,

52:45.240 --> 52:48.880
 and the critical race theory stuff forced its way in,

52:50.060 --> 52:52.540
 partly in the way that all of this

52:52.540 --> 52:54.520
 that's now known as anti racism does,

52:54.520 --> 52:56.760
 which is in a sort of bullying tone

52:56.760 --> 52:58.180
 of saying if you don't follow this.

52:58.180 --> 52:59.900
 It's the same way that all the things

52:59.900 --> 53:01.460
 that are called studies,

53:01.460 --> 53:04.360
 I think everything called studies in the humanities

53:04.360 --> 53:06.920
 should be shut down.

53:06.920 --> 53:09.420
 Because of the activist element.

53:09.420 --> 53:12.760
 They're all activists, gay studies and queer studies,

53:12.760 --> 53:16.360
 and nothing good has ever come from it.

53:16.360 --> 53:17.400
 Nothing good.

53:17.400 --> 53:21.400
 To push back, is it obvious that activism

53:21.400 --> 53:24.720
 is a sign of a flaw in a discipline?

53:24.720 --> 53:26.040
 So isn't it?

53:26.040 --> 53:27.840
 It's a sign of the death of the discipline.

53:27.840 --> 53:29.800
 It's a sign the discipline's over.

53:29.800 --> 53:33.000
 But isn't it a good goal to have for discipline

53:33.000 --> 53:36.460
 to enact change, positive change in the world?

53:36.460 --> 53:41.240
 Or is that for politicians to do with the findings

53:41.240 --> 53:44.240
 of science, not the scientists themselves?

53:44.240 --> 53:47.040
 Why create an ideology and then set out

53:47.040 --> 53:49.960
 to find disciplines that are weakly put together

53:49.960 --> 53:53.560
 to try to back up your political ideology?

53:53.560 --> 53:58.560
 So ideology should not be part of science or of humanities.

54:00.400 --> 54:04.740
 Why would you, I mean, anyone could do it.

54:05.640 --> 54:09.520
 You could decide to go in and be wildly right wing

54:09.520 --> 54:11.320
 about something and only do things

54:11.320 --> 54:13.720
 that prove your right wing ideas.

54:13.720 --> 54:16.280
 Be fantastically antiacademic,

54:16.280 --> 54:18.400
 fantastically anti science.

54:18.400 --> 54:23.400
 It's an absurd way to mix up activism and academia.

54:25.560 --> 54:26.960
 And it's absolutely rife.

54:26.960 --> 54:28.760
 And Critical Race Theory is one of the ones

54:28.760 --> 54:31.680
 that completely polluted the academy.

54:31.680 --> 54:34.360
 Yeah, and there's been dark moments throughout history,

54:34.360 --> 54:38.040
 both during World War II with both communism

54:38.040 --> 54:43.040
 and Nazism, fascism that infiltrated science

54:44.400 --> 54:45.920
 and then corrupted it.

54:45.920 --> 54:47.840
 Yes, I mean, for instance, also,

54:47.840 --> 54:50.560
 let's face it, in science, as in everything else,

54:50.560 --> 54:53.720
 there are dark, difficult things.

54:53.720 --> 54:55.840
 It's much better we know about them, face up to them

54:55.840 --> 54:59.240
 and try to find a way socially to deal with them

54:59.240 --> 55:02.640
 than that you leave them in the hands of some activist

55:02.640 --> 55:04.960
 who wants to do stuff with them.

55:04.960 --> 55:07.720
 Some of my best friends are activists.

55:07.720 --> 55:09.080
 I'm just kidding, okay.

55:09.080 --> 55:11.240
 None of my best friends are activists.

55:11.240 --> 55:12.480
 That's how it should be.

55:13.960 --> 55:15.880
 Well, I was kidding because I don't have any friends,

55:15.880 --> 55:16.720
 but okay.

55:18.120 --> 55:22.960
 No, I'm trying to gain some pity points.

55:22.960 --> 55:24.520
 Okay, so to return.

55:24.520 --> 55:27.040
 You have your clubhouse friends.

55:27.040 --> 55:31.280
 Screaming away like deranged maniacs.

55:31.280 --> 55:32.400
 Now, I'm anti clubhouse, by the way,

55:32.400 --> 55:34.720
 because the only time I heard it was at Brett Weinstein one

55:34.720 --> 55:36.360
 when he did that.

55:36.360 --> 55:38.280
 I don't know if you heard that, early in clubhouse.

55:38.280 --> 55:39.960
 I was invited to clubhouse by various people.

55:39.960 --> 55:41.520
 He was like, oh, this is a really great civilized way

55:41.520 --> 55:43.600
 to hang out and talk with interesting people.

55:43.600 --> 55:46.520
 And I downloaded the app and I got on one,

55:46.520 --> 55:48.480
 because Brett Weinstein said,

55:48.480 --> 55:50.120
 I'm doing this conversation and I listened

55:50.120 --> 55:54.160
 and it was the maddest damn discussion I've ever heard.

55:54.160 --> 55:55.600
 Was it something about biology?

55:55.600 --> 55:58.960
 Something about, was it during COVID times?

55:58.960 --> 56:01.200
 At some point, Brett said,

56:01.200 --> 56:06.200
 I'm an evolutionary biologist.

56:06.200 --> 56:09.760
 And somebody else started saying, you're a eugenicist.

56:09.760 --> 56:12.440
 And he said, no, I'm an evolutionary biologist.

56:12.440 --> 56:14.920
 And somebody said, that's the same thing.

56:14.920 --> 56:16.520
 And it just went on like that.

56:16.520 --> 56:19.000
 And Brett desperately tried to explain,

56:19.000 --> 56:21.600
 that's not the same thing as being a eugenicist.

56:21.600 --> 56:24.040
 And he lost the clubhouse room.

56:24.040 --> 56:25.720
 They thought that was the same thing.

56:25.720 --> 56:29.120
 He'd come, it horribly reminded me of a time some years ago

56:29.120 --> 56:32.680
 when a British newspaper ran a sort of realizing

56:32.680 --> 56:34.240
 that the only thing you can unite people on

56:34.240 --> 56:37.640
 in sexual ethics is revulsion against pedophilia,

56:37.640 --> 56:40.000
 ran an anti pedo campaign.

56:40.000 --> 56:43.720
 And shortly after pediatricians offices

56:43.720 --> 56:46.000
 were torched in North of England

56:46.000 --> 56:48.880
 by a mob who hadn't read the whole sign.

56:48.880 --> 56:53.020
 Yeah, well, to me, like I said,

56:53.020 --> 56:55.420
 a little bit of poison is good for the town, so.

56:55.420 --> 56:56.840
 Anyhow, sorry, I interrupted you

56:56.840 --> 56:58.760
 with flattering you with their people on clubhouse.

56:58.760 --> 57:03.760
 I have many, I have multiples of friends, yes.

57:04.320 --> 57:08.080
 Okay, we didn't get to some of the ideas

57:08.080 --> 57:09.480
 of critical race theory.

57:09.480 --> 57:11.940
 What exactly is it?

57:11.940 --> 57:14.480
 I'm actually in part asking this question quite genuinely.

57:14.480 --> 57:17.580
 Yeah, it's an attempt to look at everything

57:17.580 --> 57:20.220
 among other things through the lens of race

57:20.220 --> 57:24.360
 and to add race into things where it may not be

57:24.360 --> 57:26.220
 as a way of adding,

57:26.220 --> 57:30.040
 I'm trying to give the most generous estimation,

57:30.040 --> 57:31.880
 to add race in as a conversation

57:31.880 --> 57:35.140
 in a place where it may not have been in the conversation.

57:36.960 --> 57:38.600
 And that means history too?

57:38.600 --> 57:40.440
 The history of racism.

57:40.440 --> 57:43.320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, all history.

57:43.320 --> 57:45.920
 And to look at it through these particular lenses.

57:48.240 --> 57:50.800
 I mean, there's a certain, like all these things,

57:50.800 --> 57:51.880
 there's a certain logic in it.

57:51.880 --> 57:54.960
 Like with feminist studies or something,

57:54.960 --> 57:57.280
 I mean, is there a utility in looking back

57:57.280 --> 57:59.880
 through undoubtedly male dominated histories

57:59.880 --> 58:03.640
 and asking where the more silent female voice was?

58:03.640 --> 58:06.100
 Yes, very interesting.

58:06.100 --> 58:08.440
 Not endlessly interesting.

58:08.440 --> 58:12.800
 And can't be put exactly on the same par as,

58:12.800 --> 58:14.860
 but it has a utility.

58:16.660 --> 58:18.480
 It's that endlessly, sorry to interrupt,

58:18.480 --> 58:20.240
 that endlessly part that seems to get us

58:20.240 --> 58:21.600
 into trouble a lot here.

58:21.600 --> 58:24.300
 Well, because of this thing of where do you stop?

58:24.300 --> 58:29.300
 And that's always, I talked about this in my last book

58:30.920 --> 58:32.120
 in the manners of crowds.

58:32.120 --> 58:35.560
 It's one of the big conundrums in activist movements

58:35.560 --> 58:38.520
 and particularly in activist academia.

58:38.520 --> 58:39.360
 Where would you stop?

58:39.360 --> 58:42.080
 It's not clear because you've got a job in it.

58:42.080 --> 58:44.000
 You've got a pension in it.

58:44.000 --> 58:48.480
 You've got, your only esteem in society

58:48.480 --> 58:50.300
 is in keeping this gig going.

58:50.300 --> 58:55.300
 I mean, is there any likelihood?

58:55.660 --> 58:58.780
 Have you ever, there's the old academic joke, isn't it?

58:58.780 --> 59:00.900
 The end of every conference, the only thing everyone

59:00.900 --> 59:02.740
 agrees on is that we must have another conference

59:02.740 --> 59:03.580
 like this one.

59:05.220 --> 59:07.300
 It's the one thing they always agree on.

59:07.300 --> 59:09.780
 This conference is so great, we must have another one.

59:09.780 --> 59:11.300
 Well, that's a criticism you could apply

59:11.300 --> 59:12.460
 to a lot of disciplines.

59:12.460 --> 59:13.300
 Of course.

59:13.300 --> 59:15.460
 Civil engineering, bridge building.

59:15.460 --> 59:19.060
 At a certain point, do we need any more bridges?

59:19.060 --> 59:20.780
 Can we just fly everywhere?

59:22.340 --> 59:23.180
 So.

59:23.180 --> 59:26.100
 At the very least, you need to keep the bridges up.

59:26.100 --> 59:28.820
 Sure, and they would, critical race theory folks

59:28.820 --> 59:30.940
 would probably make the same argument.

59:30.940 --> 59:33.540
 At the very least, we need to keep the racism out.

59:35.100 --> 59:37.700
 We have to make sure we don't descend into the racism.

59:37.700 --> 59:39.820
 It assumes all the time that we are living

59:39.820 --> 59:42.320
 on the cusp of the return of the KKK.

59:42.320 --> 59:43.160
 Right.

59:43.160 --> 59:44.580
 Which is totally wrong.

59:44.580 --> 59:45.540
 I mean, it's a massive.

59:45.540 --> 59:49.940
 You say that now, until the KKK armies march in.

59:49.940 --> 59:52.500
 We don't always, we can't always predict the future.

59:52.500 --> 59:53.820
 We can't always predict the future,

59:53.820 --> 59:58.460
 and you can always say you should be careful,

59:58.460 --> 1:00:02.700
 but you've also gotta be careful of people

1:00:02.700 --> 1:00:05.300
 who've got their timing like totally, totally wrong,

1:00:05.300 --> 1:00:07.020
 or their estimation of the society they're in.

1:00:07.020 --> 1:00:12.020
 You mean like most of society before in the 1930s,

1:00:12.020 --> 1:00:17.020
 when Hitler was, I mean, so many people got Hitler wrong.

1:00:17.140 --> 1:00:18.140
 Sure they did.

1:00:18.140 --> 1:00:18.980
 And so.

1:00:18.980 --> 1:00:19.820
 Most people.

1:00:19.820 --> 1:00:23.660
 So maybe it was nice to have the alarmist thinking there.

1:00:23.660 --> 1:00:24.500
 Well.

1:00:24.500 --> 1:00:27.640
 Beware of the man with the mustache.

1:00:27.640 --> 1:00:28.480
 Yes.

1:00:28.480 --> 1:00:29.800
 If only it was that easy.

1:00:31.700 --> 1:00:33.340
 Not always a bob facial hair.

1:00:33.340 --> 1:00:35.660
 I always say that, I mean, what.

1:00:35.660 --> 1:00:36.580
 Very often is.

1:00:36.580 --> 1:00:39.220
 These two clean shaven chaps both say,

1:00:39.220 --> 1:00:40.220
 one of the problems of everybody

1:00:40.220 --> 1:00:42.660
 knowing a little bit about Nazism

1:00:42.660 --> 1:00:47.660
 is that they think that they know where evil comes from

1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:52.100
 and that it comes from like a German with a small mustache,

1:00:52.100 --> 1:00:54.800
 getting people to goose step, for instance.

1:00:54.800 --> 1:00:56.280
 And that's not correct.

1:00:57.220 --> 1:00:59.600
 A much better understanding of it is,

1:00:59.600 --> 1:01:03.120
 it can come from all number of directions

1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:06.260
 and keep your antennae as good as you can.

1:01:06.260 --> 1:01:10.300
 But once you end up in this society, which I would argue,

1:01:10.300 --> 1:01:15.040
 certainly parts of America, where you're always in 1938,

1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:17.940
 that's not healthy for a society either,

1:01:17.940 --> 1:01:22.020
 where people are so primed and think they're so well trained

1:01:22.020 --> 1:01:25.820
 because they spent a term in school

1:01:25.820 --> 1:01:28.140
 learning about the Second World War and the Holocaust,

1:01:28.140 --> 1:01:30.900
 think they're so well trained in Hitler spotting

1:01:31.780 --> 1:01:32.980
 that they can do it all the time.

1:01:32.980 --> 1:01:35.300
 Look at all these phrases we now have in our societies,

1:01:35.300 --> 1:01:37.300
 like dog whistle.

1:01:37.300 --> 1:01:38.140
 You know, as I always say,

1:01:38.140 --> 1:01:40.120
 if you hear the whistle, you're the dog.

1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:43.340
 But people say, that's a dog whistle,

1:01:43.340 --> 1:01:46.460
 as if they're highly trained anti Nazis.

1:01:47.540 --> 1:01:50.140
 I mean, you know, there should be some humility in it.

1:01:50.140 --> 1:01:52.800
 We should be careful, we should be wary for sure.

1:01:54.300 --> 1:01:57.220
 And we should also be slightly humble

1:01:57.220 --> 1:02:01.560
 in our inability to spot everything.

1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:06.560
 If not significantly humble, right, so if we can,

1:02:10.860 --> 1:02:15.400
 there's something funny, if not dark,

1:02:15.400 --> 1:02:19.900
 about the activity of Hitler spotting,

1:02:19.900 --> 1:02:21.480
 if I just may take an aside.

1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:26.480
 But so critical race theory, how much racism,

1:02:27.020 --> 1:02:28.700
 what is racism?

1:02:28.700 --> 1:02:31.200
 How much of it is in our world today?

1:02:31.200 --> 1:02:34.640
 If we were thinking about this activity of Hitler spotting,

1:02:37.620 --> 1:02:39.620
 and trying to steel man the case

1:02:39.620 --> 1:02:41.100
 of if not critical race theory,

1:02:41.100 --> 1:02:45.740
 but people who look for racism in our world,

1:02:45.740 --> 1:02:48.100
 how much would you say?

1:02:48.100 --> 1:02:50.100
 Well, it's a good thing to try to define.

1:02:50.100 --> 1:02:54.880
 I would say that racism is the belief

1:02:54.880 --> 1:02:57.860
 that other people are inferior to you.

1:02:57.860 --> 1:03:00.140
 You could say, you could see a form of it

1:03:00.140 --> 1:03:02.460
 where you thought people were superior to you.

1:03:02.460 --> 1:03:04.620
 That could also happen, but more commonly,

1:03:04.620 --> 1:03:07.260
 you see a group of people as being inferior to you

1:03:07.260 --> 1:03:08.580
 simply by dint of the fact

1:03:08.580 --> 1:03:11.280
 that they have a different racial background.

1:03:12.380 --> 1:03:17.380
 And that's sort of the easiest way to define racism.

1:03:20.980 --> 1:03:23.380
 As I say, I mean, there are types of racism,

1:03:23.380 --> 1:03:26.820
 mainly antisemitism actually, perhaps it's the only one,

1:03:26.820 --> 1:03:30.860
 which weirdly relies on a hatred of people

1:03:30.860 --> 1:03:34.660
 who a certain type of person thinks are better than them.

1:03:35.740 --> 1:03:37.900
 And that's a particular peculiarity,

1:03:37.900 --> 1:03:40.160
 one of the peculiarities of antisemitism.

1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:42.820
 Well, antisemitism somehow does both, right?

1:03:42.820 --> 1:03:46.340
 Yes, one of the eternal fascinating things

1:03:46.340 --> 1:03:47.860
 about antisemitism is it can do,

1:03:47.860 --> 1:03:49.980
 it does everything at the same time.

1:03:50.820 --> 1:03:52.860
 It's like a quantum racism.

1:03:52.860 --> 1:03:53.700
 Yes.

1:03:53.700 --> 1:03:54.940
 They're both superior and inferior.

1:03:54.940 --> 1:03:58.920
 You know Vasily Grosman's Life and Fate?

1:03:59.980 --> 1:04:02.340
 So in the middle of Life and Fate,

1:04:02.340 --> 1:04:03.780
 which a Persian friend of mine always said

1:04:03.780 --> 1:04:06.020
 was one of only two great novels of the 20th century,

1:04:06.020 --> 1:04:07.980
 she was a very harsh literary critic.

1:04:07.980 --> 1:04:09.020
 What was the other one?

1:04:09.020 --> 1:04:10.880
 Oh, The Leopard, obviously.

1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:11.720
 The Leopard?

1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:14.060
 The Leopard by Giuseppe Dallan Pedusa, yeah.

1:04:14.060 --> 1:04:14.900
 Okay.

1:04:14.900 --> 1:04:16.840
 She's definitely right on that one.

1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:17.680
 Life and Fate is a...

1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:19.520
 I'm learning so much today, yes.

1:04:19.520 --> 1:04:24.000
 Life and Fate is an extraordinary book,

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:28.660
 mainly about, well, you know, Grosman was obviously

1:04:28.660 --> 1:04:33.660
 Jewish himself, but he saw almost everything

1:04:34.300 --> 1:04:36.220
 that he could have done in the Second World War.

1:04:36.220 --> 1:04:38.700
 He saw Stalingrad, he was a journalist,

1:04:38.700 --> 1:04:42.020
 and he wrote firsthand accounts of Stalingrad.

1:04:42.020 --> 1:04:45.940
 He was also the first journalist into Treblinka,

1:04:45.940 --> 1:04:47.380
 and his account, which you can read in one

1:04:47.380 --> 1:04:49.300
 of the collections of his journalism,

1:04:49.300 --> 1:04:51.260
 his account of walking into Treblinka

1:04:51.260 --> 1:04:54.660
 is just one of the most devastating, haunting pieces

1:04:54.660 --> 1:04:56.700
 of journalism or prose you can read.

1:04:56.700 --> 1:04:58.800
 Anyhow, I mention him because Grosman,

1:04:58.800 --> 1:05:00.260
 in the middle of Life and Fate,

1:05:00.260 --> 1:05:02.220
 which is about a 900 page novel,

1:05:03.460 --> 1:05:06.160
 in the middle of it, which is about the dark axis

1:05:06.160 --> 1:05:09.160
 around Stalingrad, he, well, at one point,

1:05:12.580 --> 1:05:14.300
 he amazingly sort of goes into the minds

1:05:14.300 --> 1:05:17.420
 of Earth Hitler and Stalin, and he says,

1:05:17.420 --> 1:05:22.180
 Stalin, in his study, feels his counterpart

1:05:22.180 --> 1:05:24.300
 in Berlin, and he says he feels very close

1:05:24.300 --> 1:05:25.400
 to him at this moment.

1:05:26.420 --> 1:05:29.700
 Wow, around Stalingrad, like leading up to the back.

1:05:29.700 --> 1:05:32.100
 After Stalingrad, when the Germans are lost,

1:05:32.100 --> 1:05:34.220
 he says he feels the closeness of Hitler.

1:05:35.300 --> 1:05:37.460
 But Grosman, in the middle of Life and Fate,

1:05:37.460 --> 1:05:40.540
 slap bang at the worst hours of the 20th century,

1:05:41.740 --> 1:05:45.680
 suddenly dedicates a chapter to anti semitism,

1:05:45.680 --> 1:05:48.900
 and I've seen anti semitism as something

1:05:48.900 --> 1:05:51.460
 I've always been very interested in,

1:05:51.460 --> 1:05:54.780
 because I've always had an instinctive utter revulsion

1:05:54.780 --> 1:05:59.780
 of it, and also partly because of having seen bits of it

1:06:01.940 --> 1:06:02.820
 in the Middle East and elsewhere,

1:06:02.820 --> 1:06:05.340
 but I mention this because Grosman,

1:06:05.340 --> 1:06:08.140
 in the middle of Life and Fate, takes time out

1:06:08.140 --> 1:06:10.620
 and does this like three page explanation,

1:06:10.620 --> 1:06:12.900
 three page description of anti semitism,

1:06:12.900 --> 1:06:14.260
 and it's extraordinary.

1:06:14.260 --> 1:06:16.060
 I mean, the only thing I can think of

1:06:16.060 --> 1:06:19.060
 that's equally good is Gregor von Retzori,

1:06:24.260 --> 1:06:28.860
 who wrote a luridly titled, but brilliant set of novellas

1:06:28.860 --> 1:06:31.460
 called The Confessions of an Anti Semite,

1:06:31.460 --> 1:06:35.420
 and about pre First World War anti semitism

1:06:35.420 --> 1:06:36.740
 in Eastern and Central Europe.

1:06:36.740 --> 1:06:40.900
 Anyway, Grosman says, in the middle of Life and Fate,

1:06:40.900 --> 1:06:44.820
 that one of the extraordinary things about anti semitism

1:06:44.820 --> 1:06:47.260
 is that it does everything at the same time,

1:06:47.260 --> 1:06:50.140
 that the Jews get condemned in one place for being rich

1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:52.340
 and in another for being poor,

1:06:52.340 --> 1:06:54.820
 condemned in one place for assimilating

1:06:54.820 --> 1:06:56.920
 and another for not assimilating,

1:06:58.540 --> 1:07:01.820
 for assimilating too much and assimilating too little,

1:07:01.820 --> 1:07:05.500
 for being too successful for not being successful enough.

1:07:05.500 --> 1:07:10.980
 So I think it's the only racism that includes within it,

1:07:10.980 --> 1:07:14.500
 a detestation, for the real anti semit,

1:07:14.500 --> 1:07:17.580
 a detestation of people that the person may perceive

1:07:17.580 --> 1:07:21.300
 to be better than them, correctly or otherwise.

1:07:21.300 --> 1:07:24.740
 By the way, I'm embarrassed to say I have not read

1:07:24.740 --> 1:07:26.620
 this one of two greatest novels

1:07:26.620 --> 1:07:29.540
 of the 20th century, Life and Fate, Zhizny Sidba.

1:07:29.540 --> 1:07:31.180
 And just to read off of Wikipedia,

1:07:31.180 --> 1:07:32.860
 we see that Grosman, a Ukrainian Jew,

1:07:32.860 --> 1:07:35.700
 became a correspondent for the Soviet military paper,

1:07:35.700 --> 1:07:38.300
 Krasnaya Zvezda, having volunteered

1:07:38.300 --> 1:07:40.700
 and been rejected from military service,

1:07:40.700 --> 1:07:43.140
 he spent a thousand days in the front lines,

1:07:43.140 --> 1:07:45.540
 roughly three of the four years of the conflict

1:07:45.540 --> 1:07:48.060
 between the Germans and the Soviets,

1:07:48.060 --> 1:07:50.440
 and the main themes covered in,

1:07:51.860 --> 1:07:55.340
 how's it go, Life and Fate, I keep thinking Zhizny Sidba,

1:07:55.340 --> 1:07:58.500
 is a theme on Jewish identity and the Holocaust,

1:07:58.500 --> 1:08:01.180
 Grosman's idea of humanity and the human goodness,

1:08:01.180 --> 1:08:04.460
 Stalin's distortion of reality and values,

1:08:04.460 --> 1:08:07.980
 and science, life goes on, and reality of war.

1:08:07.980 --> 1:08:10.780
 It's interesting, I need to definitely, definitely read it.

1:08:10.780 --> 1:08:13.260
 I think you'll really get a lot from it.

1:08:13.260 --> 1:08:14.660
 One of the other things, sorry, I'm raffling it,

1:08:14.660 --> 1:08:15.860
 but one of the other things he does

1:08:15.860 --> 1:08:17.860
 is that he has this extraordinary ability

1:08:17.860 --> 1:08:22.820
 to talk about the absolute highest levels of the conflict

1:08:22.820 --> 1:08:24.860
 and then zoom in, it's rather like the camera work

1:08:24.860 --> 1:08:26.700
 they use in things like Lord of the Rings,

1:08:26.700 --> 1:08:30.300
 where he zooms down and gets one person

1:08:30.300 --> 1:08:32.900
 in the midst of all this, and you get on that.

1:08:32.900 --> 1:08:34.180
 Or puts you in the study, too.

1:08:34.180 --> 1:08:36.820
 So I personally have read and reread

1:08:36.820 --> 1:08:39.460
 the William Shires, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,

1:08:39.460 --> 1:08:42.860
 who's another journalist who was there,

1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:46.580
 but he does not do, interestingly enough,

1:08:46.580 --> 1:08:50.660
 given such a large novel, kind of the definitive work,

1:08:50.660 --> 1:08:52.720
 the definitive original work that goes

1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:54.940
 to source materials on Hitler,

1:08:54.940 --> 1:08:59.940
 he doesn't touch anti semitism really.

1:09:00.020 --> 1:09:01.260
 So.

1:09:01.260 --> 1:09:02.480
 Big thing to miss out.

1:09:02.480 --> 1:09:06.900
 Well, he just says it very calmly and objectively

1:09:06.900 --> 1:09:08.280
 as he does for most of the work,

1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:12.260
 that this was the fact of life.

1:09:12.260 --> 1:09:13.820
 There's a lot of cruelty throughout,

1:09:13.820 --> 1:09:15.220
 but he doesn't get to.

1:09:15.220 --> 1:09:16.820
 Well, one of the things is, of course,

1:09:16.820 --> 1:09:19.780
 they lost the war because of anti semitism.

1:09:19.780 --> 1:09:22.500
 I mean, that's one kind of important way to view it.

1:09:22.500 --> 1:09:24.420
 It's how Andrew Roberts, another historian, said it,

1:09:24.420 --> 1:09:26.700
 is that in the end, the Nazis lost the war

1:09:26.700 --> 1:09:27.940
 because they were Nazis.

1:09:29.540 --> 1:09:32.460
 It sounds almost too neat, but it's worth remembering

1:09:32.460 --> 1:09:35.660
 that at the end of the war,

1:09:35.660 --> 1:09:38.740
 when the Germans need to be transporting troops

1:09:38.740 --> 1:09:42.620
 and they need to be transporting very basic supplies,

1:09:42.620 --> 1:09:45.140
 Eichmann makes sure he gets the trains

1:09:45.140 --> 1:09:49.180
 to transport the Jews right up to the end.

1:09:49.180 --> 1:09:52.500
 Well, that's certainly a dark possibility.

1:09:52.500 --> 1:09:55.860
 Anyhow, but to go back to racism in general.

1:09:55.860 --> 1:09:58.020
 Racism in general, apart from anti semitism,

1:09:58.020 --> 1:10:03.020
 relies on the perception that another group of people,

1:10:04.260 --> 1:10:07.940
 a racial group, other than your own, are inferior to you.

1:10:07.940 --> 1:10:11.220
 That's what I'd say is the easiest shorthand of racism.

1:10:11.220 --> 1:10:15.340
 And of course, it's one of the stupidest things

1:10:15.340 --> 1:10:17.860
 that our species is capable of.

1:10:17.860 --> 1:10:19.660
 I mean, one of the stupidest,

1:10:19.660 --> 1:10:23.340
 that you can look at a person and guess them

1:10:24.580 --> 1:10:28.140
 in their entirety, in fact, because of their skin color.

1:10:28.140 --> 1:10:31.820
 I mean, it's like, what a stupid idea that is,

1:10:31.820 --> 1:10:32.860
 as well as being an evil one.

1:10:32.860 --> 1:10:37.860
 But I would say that one of the,

1:10:39.020 --> 1:10:41.140
 I think it's a dangerous thing in our era

1:10:41.140 --> 1:10:43.060
 that there are bits of it coming back.

1:10:43.060 --> 1:10:45.060
 That's why I say we do need sort of,

1:10:46.220 --> 1:10:48.540
 we need our antennae working.

1:10:48.540 --> 1:10:50.460
 We just don't need them to be overactive

1:10:50.460 --> 1:10:52.220
 or underactive, you know.

1:10:53.260 --> 1:10:55.460
 Now, the book is War in the West,

1:10:55.460 --> 1:11:00.260
 but speaking of racism, racism towards different groups

1:11:00.260 --> 1:11:01.460
 based on their skin color,

1:11:01.460 --> 1:11:05.340
 you've said that there's a war on white people in the US.

1:11:05.340 --> 1:11:06.660
 Would you say that's the case?

1:11:06.660 --> 1:11:08.900
 Would you say that there is significant

1:11:11.060 --> 1:11:13.420
 racism towards white people in the United States?

1:11:13.420 --> 1:11:15.500
 I'd say that white people in the United States

1:11:15.500 --> 1:11:16.540
 are the only people who are told

1:11:16.540 --> 1:11:18.540
 that they have hereditary sin.

1:11:20.180 --> 1:11:22.340
 And that's a big one, just to start with.

1:11:22.340 --> 1:11:23.660
 Based strictly on the color of their skin.

1:11:23.660 --> 1:11:25.620
 Based on their skin color.

1:11:25.620 --> 1:11:29.420
 I mean, I would find it so repugnant if,

1:11:29.420 --> 1:11:31.660
 and I hope everybody would join me in feeling this,

1:11:31.660 --> 1:11:33.660
 I would feel it so repugnant

1:11:33.660 --> 1:11:36.140
 if there were any school of thought in America today

1:11:36.140 --> 1:11:41.140
 that had any grasp on the public attention

1:11:41.140 --> 1:11:43.900
 that said that black people were born into evil

1:11:43.900 --> 1:11:46.340
 because of something their ancestors had done.

1:11:46.340 --> 1:11:49.660
 Like they had the mark of Cain upon them.

1:11:49.660 --> 1:11:54.260
 I mean, I think it would be such a vicious way

1:11:54.260 --> 1:11:59.260
 to try to demoralize a group of people

1:11:59.260 --> 1:12:02.700
 and to tell them that the things they would be able

1:12:02.700 --> 1:12:04.860
 to achieve in their lives are much lessened

1:12:04.860 --> 1:12:07.780
 because they should spend significant portions

1:12:07.780 --> 1:12:09.700
 of their lives trying to do something

1:12:09.700 --> 1:12:11.300
 that they didn't do.

1:12:11.300 --> 1:12:12.980
 Is there a difference?

1:12:14.020 --> 1:12:17.220
 And the obvious point left unsaid,

1:12:17.220 --> 1:12:22.220
 but let's say it, nobody in the public square says that.

1:12:23.420 --> 1:12:25.620
 I mean, they're the maniacs at the far fringes,

1:12:25.620 --> 1:12:29.900
 but nobody in the mainstream would dare to say that,

1:12:29.900 --> 1:12:32.420
 or I think even think that about any group of people

1:12:32.420 --> 1:12:34.140
 other than white people.

1:12:34.140 --> 1:12:37.940
 And does this mean that white people are more likely

1:12:37.940 --> 1:12:41.220
 or does this mean that white people are more disadvantaged

1:12:41.220 --> 1:12:42.180
 than black people?

1:12:42.180 --> 1:12:44.980
 No, and again, let's not make this a competition,

1:12:44.980 --> 1:12:48.700
 but let's not get into, I just desperately urge people

1:12:48.700 --> 1:12:51.380
 not to get into the idea of hereditary sin

1:12:51.380 --> 1:12:53.980
 according to racial background.

1:12:53.980 --> 1:12:57.220
 Is there something to be said about the feature aspect,

1:12:57.220 --> 1:12:59.140
 sort of play devil's advocate,

1:12:59.140 --> 1:13:04.140
 about the asymmetry of sort of accusations

1:13:04.820 --> 1:13:06.340
 towards the majority?

1:13:06.340 --> 1:13:09.260
 So because white, so it's easier to attack a majority.

1:13:09.260 --> 1:13:11.300
 It is much easier, but is there something to be said

1:13:11.300 --> 1:13:14.060
 about that being a useful function of society

1:13:14.060 --> 1:13:19.060
 that you always attack, that the minority has

1:13:19.260 --> 1:13:22.100
 disproportionate power to attack the majority

1:13:22.100 --> 1:13:24.860
 so that you can always keep the majority in check?

1:13:24.860 --> 1:13:28.220
 Well, it's a dangerous game to play, isn't it?

1:13:28.220 --> 1:13:29.060
 I think.

1:13:29.060 --> 1:13:30.500
 It's a very dangerous game to play.

1:13:30.500 --> 1:13:33.340
 That's a good summary of entirety of human civilization.

1:13:33.340 --> 1:13:35.820
 Oh yeah, everything is dangerous.

1:13:35.820 --> 1:13:37.780
 But it's a very dangerous game to play that.

1:13:37.780 --> 1:13:39.700
 I wrote about this a bit in the Madness of Crowds

1:13:39.700 --> 1:13:43.060
 when I was saying like gay rights people,

1:13:43.060 --> 1:13:44.380
 the ones that still exist,

1:13:44.380 --> 1:13:46.380
 the ones who don't have homes to go to,

1:13:47.300 --> 1:13:51.580
 who want to beat up on straight people in a way,

1:13:51.580 --> 1:13:53.940
 or want to make straight people feel like they're

1:13:54.940 --> 1:13:59.940
 kind of unremarkable, uncool, you know, boring straights.

1:14:00.780 --> 1:14:02.380
 So boring.

1:14:02.380 --> 1:14:06.100
 So not like the magical pixie fairy dust gays.

1:14:07.980 --> 1:14:10.820
 That's a bad idea to push that one.

1:14:10.820 --> 1:14:11.740
 That's a bad idea.

1:14:11.740 --> 1:14:13.580
 And some gays push that.

1:14:15.420 --> 1:14:19.100
 Highly unwise, given the fact that about

1:14:19.100 --> 1:14:21.060
 two to 3% of the population are actually gay,

1:14:21.060 --> 1:14:23.740
 although now there's like an additional 20%

1:14:23.740 --> 1:14:25.900
 who think they're like two spirit or something

1:14:25.900 --> 1:14:30.900
 and all that bullshit, but they're just attention seekers.

1:14:30.900 --> 1:14:34.140
 So let's not spend too much time on that.

1:14:34.140 --> 1:14:37.300
 But equally, as I said in the Madness of Crowds,

1:14:37.300 --> 1:14:40.580
 with the feminist movement,

1:14:40.580 --> 1:14:43.420
 very unwise for half of the species

1:14:43.420 --> 1:14:46.180
 to say that the other half of the species isn't needed.

1:14:47.220 --> 1:14:49.900
 And there were always third and fourth wave feminists

1:14:49.900 --> 1:14:52.180
 willing to make that nuts argument.

1:14:53.740 --> 1:14:54.860
 Not first wave feminists.

1:14:54.860 --> 1:14:56.020
 You didn't hear it in first wave feminists.

1:14:56.020 --> 1:14:56.860
 You didn't hear it.

1:14:56.860 --> 1:15:00.300
 Suffragette tended not to say we like the vote

1:15:00.300 --> 1:15:02.340
 and men are scum.

1:15:03.540 --> 1:15:05.180
 It would have been hard to have won everyone

1:15:05.180 --> 1:15:06.540
 over to their side.

1:15:06.540 --> 1:15:09.180
 Not least the men they needed to win over to their side.

1:15:09.180 --> 1:15:10.860
 But you do get third and fourth wave feminists

1:15:10.860 --> 1:15:14.020
 who say like, do we need men?

1:15:14.020 --> 1:15:15.460
 Or men are all X.

1:15:15.460 --> 1:15:17.340
 Again, it's a bad idea.

1:15:17.340 --> 1:15:19.740
 It's a bad idea tactically.

1:15:19.740 --> 1:15:24.480
 What if men, Richard Wrangham, somebody from Harvard,

1:15:25.700 --> 1:15:29.620
 describes that men are the originators of violence,

1:15:29.620 --> 1:15:31.660
 physical violence in society.

1:15:31.660 --> 1:15:35.540
 And he argues that actually the world would be better off.

1:15:35.540 --> 1:15:38.660
 No, just a very cold calculus.

1:15:38.660 --> 1:15:40.180
 If you get rid of men,

1:15:40.180 --> 1:15:44.300
 there will be a lot less violence in society is his claim.

1:15:44.300 --> 1:15:47.580
 But who says you need to get rid of violence in society?

1:15:47.580 --> 1:15:50.460
 But shouldn't that at least be a discussion?

1:15:50.460 --> 1:15:51.660
 The pros and cons.

1:15:51.660 --> 1:15:54.140
 Have a debate, a panel discussion,

1:15:54.140 --> 1:15:55.620
 violence, pros and cons.

1:15:55.620 --> 1:15:57.540
 Well, that's the sort of thing, if I can say so,

1:15:57.540 --> 1:15:59.980
 that some weak ass academic decides to do

1:15:59.980 --> 1:16:02.580
 because he thinks that his area of Boston

1:16:02.580 --> 1:16:04.300
 would be nicer or whatever.

1:16:06.380 --> 1:16:07.780
 He might decide it's useful

1:16:07.780 --> 1:16:12.240
 if he was living in Kiev today to have violent men.

1:16:13.820 --> 1:16:17.980
 I mean, it might, if New York was invaded right now,

1:16:17.980 --> 1:16:20.560
 I'd need some violent men around here.

1:16:22.020 --> 1:16:25.740
 But it wouldn't be invaded if there's no violent men.

1:16:25.740 --> 1:16:30.740
 Well, there's also, at least there's some level of threat

1:16:32.020 --> 1:16:35.660
 that you ought to exude that puts people off.

1:16:35.660 --> 1:16:39.580
 If I was in, you know, I'm very glad

1:16:39.580 --> 1:16:42.540
 that the men and women of Ukraine are capable of

1:16:42.540 --> 1:16:47.540
 and more than capable of fighting for their country

1:16:47.620 --> 1:16:49.860
 and for their neighbors and their families and much more.

1:16:49.860 --> 1:16:54.860
 But it's better that there was violence ready to unleash

1:16:54.860 --> 1:16:57.100
 when violence was unleashed upon them

1:16:57.100 --> 1:16:59.020
 than that the whole society had been told

1:16:59.020 --> 1:17:01.320
 that they should identify as non binary.

1:17:03.220 --> 1:17:05.460
 But at least it's a conversation to have.

1:17:05.460 --> 1:17:10.460
 Isn't there aspect to the sort of the feminist movement

1:17:12.100 --> 1:17:17.060
 that is correct in challenging the...

1:17:17.060 --> 1:17:20.200
 Some forms of violence, domestic violence, for instance.

1:17:20.200 --> 1:17:23.060
 Although women are capable of that as well.

1:17:23.060 --> 1:17:24.380
 I'm learning about this.

1:17:24.380 --> 1:17:26.820
 We're all learning about this at the moment.

1:17:26.820 --> 1:17:29.220
 I can't help but watch the entirety of it go down

1:17:29.220 --> 1:17:31.460
 in this beautiful mess that is human relations.

1:17:31.460 --> 1:17:32.300
 Okay.

1:17:32.300 --> 1:17:33.660
 But just to finish up that thought,

1:17:33.660 --> 1:17:38.660
 it's very unwise for women to war against men

1:17:39.260 --> 1:17:41.220
 as it would be for men to war against women.

1:17:41.220 --> 1:17:45.300
 It's highly, highly unwise to war on a majority population.

1:17:45.300 --> 1:17:47.740
 And in America, Britain and other Western countries,

1:17:47.740 --> 1:17:49.780
 white people are still a majority.

1:17:49.780 --> 1:17:52.900
 And so why would you tell the majority of their evil

1:17:52.900 --> 1:17:55.140
 by dint of their skin color?

1:17:55.140 --> 1:17:56.700
 And think that that would be a good way

1:17:56.700 --> 1:17:58.100
 to keep them in check.

1:17:59.060 --> 1:18:02.060
 I mean, I'm not guilty of anything because of my skin color.

1:18:02.060 --> 1:18:03.300
 I'm not guilty of anything.

1:18:03.300 --> 1:18:05.820
 My ancestors didn't do anything wrong.

1:18:05.820 --> 1:18:06.700
 And even if they had,

1:18:06.700 --> 1:18:08.780
 why would I be held responsible for it?

1:18:09.980 --> 1:18:13.100
 So to go back to Nietzsche,

1:18:13.100 --> 1:18:14.780
 is there some aspect to where,

1:18:14.780 --> 1:18:18.300
 if we try to explain the forces at play here,

1:18:18.300 --> 1:18:22.500
 is it the will to power playing itself out

1:18:22.500 --> 1:18:23.980
 from individual human nature

1:18:23.980 --> 1:18:27.780
 and from group behavior nature?

1:18:27.780 --> 1:18:30.020
 Is there some elements to this

1:18:30.020 --> 1:18:32.740
 which is the game we play as human beings

1:18:32.740 --> 1:18:34.780
 is always when we have less power,

1:18:34.780 --> 1:18:36.900
 we try to find ways to gain more power.

1:18:36.900 --> 1:18:39.260
 That's certainly one.

1:18:39.260 --> 1:18:42.740
 The desire to grab is,

1:18:42.740 --> 1:18:45.780
 let me see if I can find a quote for you on that.

1:18:45.780 --> 1:18:49.860
 The desire to grab that which we think we're owed

1:18:49.860 --> 1:18:54.220
 and to do it often in the guise of justice.

1:18:56.780 --> 1:19:00.700
 I mean, justice is one of the great terms of our age

1:19:00.700 --> 1:19:03.740
 and one of the great bogus terms of our age.

1:19:03.740 --> 1:19:06.140
 People forever talk about their search for justice.

1:19:06.140 --> 1:19:08.300
 It's amazing how violent they can often be

1:19:08.300 --> 1:19:09.580
 in their search for justice

1:19:09.580 --> 1:19:11.860
 and how many rules they're willing to break

1:19:11.860 --> 1:19:14.180
 so long as they can say they're after justice

1:19:14.180 --> 1:19:16.220
 and how many norms they can trample

1:19:16.220 --> 1:19:18.500
 so long as they can say it's in the name of justice.

1:19:18.500 --> 1:19:21.420
 You can burn down buildings in the name of justice.

1:19:21.420 --> 1:19:23.700
 Well, the majority groups throughout history,

1:19:23.700 --> 1:19:25.620
 including those with white skin color

1:19:25.620 --> 1:19:28.260
 have done the same in the name of justice.

1:19:28.260 --> 1:19:31.100
 We come up with all kinds of sexy terms

1:19:31.100 --> 1:19:32.420
 in our propaganda machines

1:19:32.420 --> 1:19:35.500
 to sell whatever atrocities we'd like to commit.

1:19:36.580 --> 1:19:40.100
 One of the quotes from Nietzsche that I liked

1:19:40.100 --> 1:19:41.180
 and I quoted in this book.

1:19:41.180 --> 1:19:43.060
 Careful, I'm judging you harshly.

1:19:43.060 --> 1:19:43.900
 Yeah, of course.

1:19:43.900 --> 1:19:48.900
 Nietzsche says that one of the dangers of men of resentment

1:19:49.740 --> 1:19:52.980
 is they'll achieve their ultimate form of revenge,

1:19:52.980 --> 1:19:54.660
 which is to turn happy people

1:19:54.660 --> 1:19:57.380
 into unhappy people like themselves,

1:19:57.380 --> 1:19:59.780
 to shove their misery in the faces of the happy

1:19:59.780 --> 1:20:01.380
 so that in due course the happy,

1:20:01.380 --> 1:20:02.660
 and this is quoting Nietzsche,

1:20:02.660 --> 1:20:05.300
 start to be ashamed of their happiness

1:20:05.300 --> 1:20:06.780
 and perhaps say to one another,

1:20:06.780 --> 1:20:08.900
 it's a disgrace to be happy.

1:20:08.900 --> 1:20:11.060
 There is too much misery.

1:20:11.060 --> 1:20:12.220
 This is something to be averted.

1:20:12.220 --> 1:20:15.980
 The sick, says Nietzsche, must not make the healthy sick too

1:20:15.980 --> 1:20:20.060
 or make the healthy confuse themselves with the sick.

1:20:20.060 --> 1:20:24.100
 Well, I think that again, there's a lot of that going on.

1:20:24.100 --> 1:20:27.060
 How could I be happy when there is unhappiness in the world?

1:20:27.060 --> 1:20:29.660
 Why should I not join the ranks of the unhappy?

1:20:31.100 --> 1:20:34.140
 I think Dostoevsky has a book about that as well.

1:20:34.140 --> 1:20:34.980
 Sure.

1:20:34.980 --> 1:20:36.300
 Knows From Underground.

1:20:36.300 --> 1:20:37.140
 Okay.

1:20:39.340 --> 1:20:41.580
 This has been very Russian, Russian focus.

1:20:41.580 --> 1:20:43.500
 I'm very pleased with another times,

1:20:43.500 --> 1:20:46.340
 but Dostoevsky and Grossman and others have come in.

1:20:46.340 --> 1:20:49.020
 I wasn't doing this as a sort of.

1:20:49.020 --> 1:20:51.940
 Yeah, well, it's always good to plug the greats

1:20:53.980 --> 1:20:56.100
 and get to know they're still relevant.

1:20:57.060 --> 1:20:59.780
 Do you speak Russian by the way at all?

1:20:59.780 --> 1:21:00.820
 Which I did.

1:21:00.820 --> 1:21:02.980
 I'm told it's a 10 year language basically

1:21:02.980 --> 1:21:06.060
 to learn from scratch as my friends who have done it.

1:21:06.060 --> 1:21:09.580
 Well, there's the language and then there's the personality

1:21:09.580 --> 1:21:11.300
 behind the language and the personality.

1:21:11.300 --> 1:21:12.940
 I feel like you already have.

1:21:12.940 --> 1:21:15.100
 So you just need to know the surface details.

1:21:15.100 --> 1:21:18.420
 Okay.

1:21:18.420 --> 1:21:22.780
 In fact, the silence to be silent in the Russian language

1:21:22.780 --> 1:21:24.780
 is something that's already important.

1:21:24.780 --> 1:21:25.940
 Oh, I should, if we had a moment,

1:21:25.940 --> 1:21:28.140
 I'd tell you my story about Stalin's birthplace.

1:21:28.140 --> 1:21:28.980
 Should I tell you that?

1:21:28.980 --> 1:21:29.820
 No.

1:21:29.820 --> 1:21:31.900
 I once went to Gori where Stalin was born.

1:21:33.060 --> 1:21:33.900
 Have you been?

1:21:33.900 --> 1:21:34.740
 No, no.

1:21:34.740 --> 1:21:36.660
 I was there just after the Georgia war.

1:21:36.660 --> 1:21:41.420
 And I went to the nomads land in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

1:21:42.660 --> 1:21:47.300
 And I said, I really got to go to Gori also here

1:21:47.300 --> 1:21:49.420
 because the shell had landed in Gori rather weirdly

1:21:49.420 --> 1:21:53.300
 from the Russian side and Gori is where Stalin was born.

1:21:53.300 --> 1:21:55.580
 And of course, Gori is in Georgia.

1:21:55.580 --> 1:21:59.420
 And when we had the museum of Stalin's birthplace,

1:21:59.420 --> 1:22:01.620
 they'd been trying to change for some years

1:22:01.620 --> 1:22:06.620
 because it had been unadulteratedly pro Stalin for years.

1:22:06.660 --> 1:22:07.740
 And the Georgian authorities,

1:22:07.740 --> 1:22:11.780
 this is in Saakashvili's time,

1:22:11.780 --> 1:22:14.700
 were trying to make it into a museum of Stalinism.

1:22:15.620 --> 1:22:17.420
 And it was really tough.

1:22:17.420 --> 1:22:19.020
 The only place I've seen which is similar

1:22:19.020 --> 1:22:22.020
 is the house in Mexico City where Trotsky was killed.

1:22:23.140 --> 1:22:25.660
 That also is that they're not quite sure to do.

1:22:25.660 --> 1:22:27.940
 They don't want to say he's a bad guy

1:22:27.940 --> 1:22:30.940
 because they think that people won't come anyhow.

1:22:30.940 --> 1:22:32.420
 Stalin's house in Gori had changed

1:22:32.420 --> 1:22:34.180
 from the museum of Stalin to the museum of Stalinism.

1:22:34.180 --> 1:22:37.180
 There was this large Georgian woman with a pink pencil

1:22:37.180 --> 1:22:40.740
 who just had clearly been doing the tour for 50 years

1:22:40.740 --> 1:22:41.940
 and just pointed all the facts.

1:22:41.940 --> 1:22:43.020
 She did that classic thing.

1:22:43.020 --> 1:22:44.820
 I've also saw it once in North Korea

1:22:44.820 --> 1:22:47.780
 where they sort of that sort of communist thing

1:22:47.780 --> 1:22:51.540
 where they say, here is, this is 147 feet high

1:22:51.540 --> 1:22:52.860
 by 13 feet deep.

1:22:52.860 --> 1:22:53.900
 They give you lots of facts.

1:22:53.900 --> 1:22:55.020
 I don't care.

1:22:55.020 --> 1:22:56.580
 What does it matter?

1:22:56.580 --> 1:22:58.780
 They always give you facts.

1:22:58.780 --> 1:23:00.180
 This is Stalin's suitcase.

1:23:00.180 --> 1:23:04.620
 It is 13 inches wide by, you know, this isn't.

1:23:04.620 --> 1:23:06.740
 Anyhow, and this woman did all of this

1:23:06.740 --> 1:23:09.540
 and it was all just wildly pro, not pro Stalin,

1:23:09.540 --> 1:23:10.660
 just explaining Stalin's life.

1:23:10.660 --> 1:23:13.780
 It was just a great local boy done good.

1:23:13.780 --> 1:23:14.980
 They didn't mention the fact he killed

1:23:14.980 --> 1:23:17.180
 more Georgians per capita than anyone else.

1:23:17.180 --> 1:23:18.780
 Local boy done good.

1:23:18.780 --> 1:23:23.260
 And we get to the end and before being taken to the gift shop

1:23:23.260 --> 1:23:25.700
 where they sell red wine with Stalin's face on it

1:23:25.700 --> 1:23:30.260
 and among other things, and a lighter with Stalin on it,

1:23:32.100 --> 1:23:35.260
 they took you to a little room under the stairs

1:23:35.260 --> 1:23:38.940
 and they said, this is a replica of interrogation cell

1:23:38.940 --> 1:23:43.940
 to show, represent horror of what happened in Stalin time.

1:23:44.420 --> 1:23:45.740
 Now, gift shop.

1:23:45.740 --> 1:23:48.540
 As I said, there's no, no kind of thing.

1:23:48.540 --> 1:23:50.740
 And I took the woman aside at the end.

1:23:50.740 --> 1:23:52.500
 I discovered she'd said this to other journalists

1:23:52.500 --> 1:23:53.740
 and visited before.

1:23:53.740 --> 1:23:54.900
 I took her aside and said,

1:23:54.900 --> 1:23:57.820
 what do you think about communist Stalin?

1:23:57.820 --> 1:24:01.060
 And she said, let's say she'd obviously done this

1:24:01.060 --> 1:24:03.460
 during communist times.

1:24:03.460 --> 1:24:08.460
 She said, it's not my place to judge, that sort of thing.

1:24:09.100 --> 1:24:10.780
 Which is an interesting comment in itself.

1:24:10.780 --> 1:24:12.980
 I said, yeah, but he killed more Georgians than anyone

1:24:12.980 --> 1:24:15.180
 and all that sort of thing.

1:24:15.180 --> 1:24:16.980
 And she said, it's not my place to judge

1:24:16.980 --> 1:24:19.020
 or to give my views and that sort of thing.

1:24:19.020 --> 1:24:22.340
 And eventually I said, well, what do you feel about it?

1:24:22.340 --> 1:24:27.340
 And she said, it was like a hurricane, it happened.

1:24:29.700 --> 1:24:32.860
 That's interesting because if I may mention Clubhouse

1:24:32.860 --> 1:24:35.900
 once again, I got a chance to talk to a few people

1:24:35.900 --> 1:24:39.100
 from Mongolia, there's a woman from Mongolia

1:24:39.100 --> 1:24:40.660
 and they talked about the fact

1:24:40.660 --> 1:24:43.500
 that they deeply admire Stalin, love.

1:24:43.500 --> 1:24:46.940
 She sounded, if I may, hopefully that's not crossing line.

1:24:46.940 --> 1:24:50.180
 I think I'm representing her correctly in saying

1:24:50.180 --> 1:24:55.060
 she admired him almost like, loved him.

1:24:55.060 --> 1:25:00.060
 Like the way people love like Jesus, like a holy figure.

1:25:00.100 --> 1:25:02.820
 Well, isn't that still the case in large parts of Russia?

1:25:02.820 --> 1:25:04.580
 I mean, Stalin keeps on winning

1:25:04.580 --> 1:25:06.060
 greatest Russian of all time.

1:25:07.500 --> 1:25:10.300
 And that's perhaps, maybe there's a dip,

1:25:10.300 --> 1:25:12.940
 but if we were to think about the long arc of history,

1:25:12.940 --> 1:25:16.220
 perhaps that's going to go up and up and up and up.

1:25:16.220 --> 1:25:18.540
 There's something about human memory

1:25:18.540 --> 1:25:20.740
 that it just, you forget the details

1:25:20.740 --> 1:25:22.820
 of the atrocities of the past and remember that.

1:25:22.820 --> 1:25:25.060
 I mean, think of the number of people we talk about

1:25:25.060 --> 1:25:27.580
 as historical heroes, Napoleon.

1:25:27.580 --> 1:25:30.420
 I mean, British people don't talk about Napoleon as a hero,

1:25:30.420 --> 1:25:35.420
 but the French, now you're, now you're on tricky ground.

1:25:38.140 --> 1:25:42.100
 But no, but like the French, normally my Napoleon

1:25:42.100 --> 1:25:44.740
 and there had many Admiral Aswit who was also

1:25:44.740 --> 1:25:49.340
 an unbelievable brute and killed many people unnecessarily.

1:25:49.340 --> 1:25:51.740
 And there are lots of figures from history

1:25:51.740 --> 1:25:53.980
 that we sort of cover that over with.

1:25:56.740 --> 1:25:58.540
 Yeah, yeah.

1:25:58.540 --> 1:26:00.300
 Can we mention Churchill briefly?

1:26:00.300 --> 1:26:05.300
 Because he is one of the, you can make a case for him

1:26:06.140 --> 1:26:08.700
 being one of the great representers

1:26:08.700 --> 1:26:12.260
 or great figures historically of Western civilization.

1:26:12.260 --> 1:26:16.820
 And then there's a lot of people from, not a lot.

1:26:16.820 --> 1:26:18.460
 I know, I have like three friends

1:26:18.460 --> 1:26:21.260
 and one of them happens to be from London.

1:26:21.260 --> 1:26:26.260
 And they say that he's not a good person.

1:26:26.620 --> 1:26:27.460
 Why?

1:26:27.460 --> 1:26:30.420
 So listen, this friend, we did not discuss.

1:26:30.420 --> 1:26:33.180
 I just, this is an opinion poll of the three friends,

1:26:33.180 --> 1:26:35.340
 but I do know that there's quite a bit, you know.

1:26:35.340 --> 1:26:37.180
 There's a backlash going on at the moment.

1:26:37.180 --> 1:26:39.220
 At the moment and in general, there's a spirit

1:26:39.220 --> 1:26:42.300
 like reflecting on the darker sides

1:26:42.300 --> 1:26:43.660
 of some of these historical figures,

1:26:43.660 --> 1:26:46.660
 like challenging history through,

1:26:46.660 --> 1:26:48.340
 it's not just critical race theory.

1:26:48.340 --> 1:26:52.020
 It's challenging history through,

1:26:52.020 --> 1:26:57.020
 well, are the people we think of as heroes,

1:26:57.940 --> 1:26:59.340
 what are their flaws?

1:26:59.340 --> 1:27:02.980
 And are they in fact villains that are convenient,

1:27:02.980 --> 1:27:07.980
 sort of, we're there at the right time

1:27:10.180 --> 1:27:12.020
 to accidentally do the right thing.

1:27:12.020 --> 1:27:13.100
 Accidentally?

1:27:15.220 --> 1:27:19.460
 I hope this isn't the representative fair summation

1:27:19.460 --> 1:27:21.260
 of your friend in London's views.

1:27:21.260 --> 1:27:23.660
 No, she's going to be quite mad at this,

1:27:23.660 --> 1:27:26.180
 but I didn't say the name, so it could be any friend.

1:27:26.180 --> 1:27:28.740
 It could be, it's like a girlfriend in Canada.

1:27:28.740 --> 1:27:30.580
 Well, see, I.

1:27:30.580 --> 1:27:31.700
 You've given that away.

1:27:31.700 --> 1:27:34.860
 Well, that's, of course I would not.

1:27:34.860 --> 1:27:36.140
 I made that up completely.

1:27:36.140 --> 1:27:39.660
 It's all, just like my girlfriend in Canada,

1:27:39.660 --> 1:27:41.780
 she's completely a figment of my imagination.

1:27:41.780 --> 1:27:46.300
 Nevertheless, Winston Churchill is somebody,

1:27:46.300 --> 1:27:48.140
 I mean, just looking at reading

1:27:48.140 --> 1:27:49.340
 The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich

1:27:49.340 --> 1:27:53.540
 is an incredible figure that to me,

1:27:55.180 --> 1:27:58.340
 so much of World War II is marked,

1:27:58.340 --> 1:27:59.980
 leading up to the war is marked

1:27:59.980 --> 1:28:03.740
 by stunning amounts of cowardice by political leaders,

1:28:03.740 --> 1:28:07.380
 and it's fascinating to watch here

1:28:07.380 --> 1:28:11.420
 this person clearly with a drinking and a smoking problem.

1:28:11.420 --> 1:28:12.260
 Was he?

1:28:12.260 --> 1:28:13.980
 I didn't understand why that's a negative.

1:28:13.980 --> 1:28:15.700
 No, I didn't say, you see.

1:28:15.700 --> 1:28:17.860
 Yeah, you throw it in as if it is.

1:28:17.860 --> 1:28:19.700
 No, well, it's called humor.

1:28:19.700 --> 1:28:21.460
 I'll explain it to you one day what that means,

1:28:21.460 --> 1:28:22.900
 but he stood.

1:28:22.900 --> 1:28:23.940
 Explain dry humor.

1:28:23.940 --> 1:28:28.940
 He stood up, he stood up to what we now see as evil

1:28:31.980 --> 1:28:34.860
 when at the time it was not so obvious to see.

1:28:36.900 --> 1:28:39.820
 You know, so that's just a fascinating figure

1:28:39.820 --> 1:28:40.780
 of Western civilization.

1:28:40.780 --> 1:28:42.220
 I'd love to get your comments.

1:28:42.220 --> 1:28:45.380
 The real criticisms, I mean, smoking and drinking.

1:28:45.380 --> 1:28:49.180
 The real criticisms of Churchill are quite easy to sum up,

1:28:49.180 --> 1:28:50.860
 and I do so in the War on the West, actually.

1:28:50.860 --> 1:28:54.060
 I say these are the things that they now use against him.

1:28:54.060 --> 1:28:56.860
 Didn't do enough to avert the Bengal famine in 1943,

1:28:56.860 --> 1:28:57.700
 for instance.

1:28:57.700 --> 1:28:59.580
 That's been shot down by numerous historians,

1:28:59.580 --> 1:29:01.660
 including Indian historians.

1:29:01.660 --> 1:29:04.140
 In the middle of the war, in the middle of a world war,

1:29:04.140 --> 1:29:05.260
 Churchill did what he could

1:29:05.260 --> 1:29:10.260
 to get grain supplies diverted from Australia to Bengal.

1:29:12.380 --> 1:29:13.820
 The famine was appalling.

1:29:13.820 --> 1:29:15.020
 It was caused by a typhoon.

1:29:15.020 --> 1:29:17.700
 It was not caused by Winston Churchill,

1:29:17.700 --> 1:29:22.060
 and the idea that some, basically,

1:29:22.060 --> 1:29:24.260
 Indian nationalist historians have pumped out

1:29:24.260 --> 1:29:28.140
 in recent years, and just anti Churchill figures,

1:29:28.140 --> 1:29:31.140
 that he actually wanted Indians to die

1:29:31.140 --> 1:29:34.380
 is just total calumny.

1:29:34.380 --> 1:29:36.260
 And when people claim, some people claim that,

1:29:36.260 --> 1:29:39.220
 I mean, there was a few very ignorant scholars,

1:29:39.220 --> 1:29:41.820
 nevertheless with some credentials,

1:29:41.820 --> 1:29:45.020
 who claim that Churchill wanted the Indian population

1:29:45.020 --> 1:29:47.260
 to basically be genocided.

1:29:47.260 --> 1:29:48.500
 And it's complete nonsense,

1:29:48.500 --> 1:29:51.220
 not least by the fact that during the period

1:29:51.220 --> 1:29:54.620
 which in question Indian population boomed.

1:29:56.140 --> 1:29:59.660
 So that's one of the main ones.

1:29:59.660 --> 1:30:02.100
 Another one is that he had some views

1:30:02.100 --> 1:30:03.420
 that we now had regarded as racist.

1:30:03.420 --> 1:30:04.660
 He definitely regarded races

1:30:04.660 --> 1:30:07.740
 as being of different characters,

1:30:07.740 --> 1:30:10.260
 and that there were superior races,

1:30:10.260 --> 1:30:13.380
 and the, as it were, the white European

1:30:13.380 --> 1:30:18.380
 was a superior culture.

1:30:19.420 --> 1:30:21.780
 He was born in Victorian England,

1:30:21.780 --> 1:30:23.540
 so he had some Victorian attitudes.

1:30:26.060 --> 1:30:28.140
 These are things in the negative side of the ledger,

1:30:28.140 --> 1:30:29.700
 and as with all history,

1:30:29.700 --> 1:30:30.540
 you should have a negative

1:30:30.540 --> 1:30:31.900
 and a positive side of the ledger.

1:30:31.900 --> 1:30:33.220
 Positive side of the ledger includes

1:30:33.220 --> 1:30:35.260
 he almost certainly did more than any one human being

1:30:35.260 --> 1:30:37.260
 to save the world from Nazism.

1:30:37.260 --> 1:30:39.460
 So that should count as something.

1:30:39.460 --> 1:30:41.220
 And one of the reasons I talk about Churchill

1:30:41.220 --> 1:30:45.180
 in this regard is to stress that if you get,

1:30:46.100 --> 1:30:49.580
 I'm not trying to stop anyone doing history at all.

1:30:49.580 --> 1:30:51.700
 I don't think that the revisionism of recent years

1:30:51.700 --> 1:30:53.940
 about Churchill or the founding fathers of America

1:30:53.940 --> 1:30:56.940
 or anyone else is anything I want to stop.

1:30:56.940 --> 1:30:58.220
 I find it interesting,

1:30:58.220 --> 1:30:59.180
 find it interesting not least

1:30:59.180 --> 1:31:00.500
 because it's so sloppy on occasions,

1:31:00.500 --> 1:31:02.220
 but I find it interesting and it's important.

1:31:02.220 --> 1:31:04.700
 And we should be able to see people in the round.

1:31:04.700 --> 1:31:08.340
 But that includes recognizing

1:31:08.340 --> 1:31:10.500
 the positive side of the ledger.

1:31:10.500 --> 1:31:13.700
 And if you can't recognize that side,

1:31:13.700 --> 1:31:15.740
 you're doing something else.

1:31:15.740 --> 1:31:16.940
 You're doing something else.

1:31:16.940 --> 1:31:18.580
 It's not history.

1:31:18.580 --> 1:31:23.380
 It's some form of politicking of a very particular kind.

1:31:23.380 --> 1:31:26.060
 And I think it's the same thing with the founding fathers.

1:31:26.060 --> 1:31:27.220
 There are some people, for instance,

1:31:27.220 --> 1:31:29.660
 certainly since the 90s who have pushed

1:31:29.660 --> 1:31:32.820
 the Sally Hemings, Thomas Jefferson story

1:31:32.820 --> 1:31:35.540
 to show that Thomas Jefferson was some kind of brute.

1:31:35.540 --> 1:31:39.740
 As a result, we see Jefferson's statue

1:31:39.740 --> 1:31:41.180
 being removed from the council chamber

1:31:41.180 --> 1:31:43.380
 of the city we're sitting in last November

1:31:43.380 --> 1:31:45.660
 by council members who said that Thomas Jefferson

1:31:45.660 --> 1:31:47.660
 no longer represents our values.

1:31:47.660 --> 1:31:51.460
 If you can't recognize greatness of Thomas Jefferson

1:31:51.460 --> 1:31:53.220
 and that he had flaws,

1:31:54.180 --> 1:31:58.580
 I mean, that's not a grownup debate.

1:31:58.580 --> 1:32:01.380
 And weigh them and weigh them in the context of the time.

1:32:01.380 --> 1:32:05.900
 But let me sort of throw a curveball at you then.

1:32:05.900 --> 1:32:08.460
 What about recognizing the positive

1:32:08.460 --> 1:32:11.060
 and the negative of a fellow with nice facial hair

1:32:11.060 --> 1:32:13.060
 called Karl Marx?

1:32:13.060 --> 1:32:14.420
 Sure, sure.

1:32:14.420 --> 1:32:17.900
 I mean, I have a section in The War in the West,

1:32:17.900 --> 1:32:20.540
 as you know, where I go for Karl Marx with some glee.

1:32:22.420 --> 1:32:26.380
 So he seems to have gotten some popularity

1:32:26.380 --> 1:32:29.100
 in the West recently.

1:32:29.100 --> 1:32:30.660
 Not just recently, yeah.

1:32:30.660 --> 1:32:32.700
 I mean, he's had a resurgence recently.

1:32:32.700 --> 1:32:33.820
 Yes, resurgence.

1:32:33.820 --> 1:32:36.940
 Well, that's because whenever things are seen to go wrong,

1:32:36.940 --> 1:32:39.820
 people reach for other options.

1:32:40.980 --> 1:32:42.420
 And when, for instance, it's very hard

1:32:42.420 --> 1:32:43.700
 for people to accumulate capital,

1:32:43.700 --> 1:32:46.660
 it's not obvious that they're gonna become capitalists.

1:32:46.660 --> 1:32:49.100
 And so one thing that happens is people say,

1:32:49.100 --> 1:32:50.660
 let's look at the Marxism thing again,

1:32:50.660 --> 1:32:52.820
 see if that's a viable goer.

1:32:52.820 --> 1:32:55.620
 And my argument would simply be,

1:32:55.620 --> 1:32:58.380
 point me to one place that's worked.

1:32:58.380 --> 1:33:01.500
 Well, the argument from the Marxists

1:33:01.500 --> 1:33:05.020
 or the Marxian economists is that

1:33:05.020 --> 1:33:08.540
 we've only really tried it once, the Soviets tried it,

1:33:08.540 --> 1:33:10.420
 and then there's a few people

1:33:10.420 --> 1:33:12.340
 that kind of tried the Soviet thing.

1:33:12.340 --> 1:33:13.740
 Huber tried it?

1:33:13.740 --> 1:33:18.740
 Well, they basically, it's an offshoot of the Soviet, yes.

1:33:18.980 --> 1:33:19.820
 They've tried it.

1:33:19.820 --> 1:33:21.020
 They tried it in Venezuela.

1:33:22.180 --> 1:33:23.380
 Yes, yes, yes.

1:33:23.380 --> 1:33:25.720
 So let's just quickly say,

1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:27.500
 how did all these experiments go?

1:33:28.820 --> 1:33:31.180
 Well, they failed in fascinating ways.

1:33:31.180 --> 1:33:32.660
 They did, but they failed.

1:33:32.660 --> 1:33:33.500
 Yes, they failed.

1:33:33.500 --> 1:33:36.860
 We should stress, so grossly failed.

1:33:36.860 --> 1:33:39.380
 So grossly failed that they threw millions

1:33:39.380 --> 1:33:43.960
 and millions of people into completely thwarted lives

1:33:43.960 --> 1:33:47.260
 that were much shorter than they should have been.

1:33:47.260 --> 1:33:50.660
 Yeah, so the lesson to learn there,

1:33:50.660 --> 1:33:52.280
 that you can learn several lessons.

1:33:52.280 --> 1:33:56.180
 One is that anything that smells like Marxism

1:33:56.180 --> 1:33:59.900
 is going to lead to a lot of problems.

1:33:59.900 --> 1:34:02.140
 Now, another lesson could be,

1:34:02.140 --> 1:34:05.940
 well, what is the fundamental idea that Marx had?

1:34:05.940 --> 1:34:10.420
 He was criticizing capitalism and the flaws of capitalism.

1:34:10.420 --> 1:34:13.420
 So is it possible to do better than capitalism?

1:34:13.420 --> 1:34:16.740
 And that's, if you take that spirit, you start to wonder.

1:34:16.740 --> 1:34:19.220
 That might actually become relevant in, I don't know,

1:34:19.220 --> 1:34:24.220
 20, 30, 50 years when the machines start doing

1:34:24.700 --> 1:34:26.620
 more and more of the labor, all those kinds of things.

1:34:26.620 --> 1:34:27.660
 You start to ask questions.

1:34:27.660 --> 1:34:29.900
 You finally might get to Marx's dream

1:34:29.900 --> 1:34:31.820
 of what the average day would look like.

1:34:31.820 --> 1:34:32.660
 Yes.

1:34:33.860 --> 1:34:35.020
 Well, there's gonna be an awful lot

1:34:35.020 --> 1:34:36.420
 of literary criticism then.

1:34:38.260 --> 1:34:39.740
 If you remember, that's what Marx said

1:34:39.740 --> 1:34:41.260
 that we would be doing in the evenings,

1:34:41.260 --> 1:34:42.580
 the laborer in the evening.

1:34:42.580 --> 1:34:45.340
 Well, he didn't know Twitter was a thing, or Netflix.

1:34:45.340 --> 1:34:47.740
 So he would change.

1:34:47.740 --> 1:34:51.740
 Are there things we could learn from Marx plausibly, possibly?

1:34:51.740 --> 1:34:53.840
 I can't think of anything myself offhand.

1:34:53.840 --> 1:34:56.780
 But to have a critique of capitalism

1:34:56.780 --> 1:34:58.940
 isn't by any means a bad thing in this society.

1:34:58.940 --> 1:35:00.780
 I'd rather that it was a critique of capitalism

1:35:00.780 --> 1:35:02.820
 that showed how you improve capitalism,

1:35:02.820 --> 1:35:04.580
 a critique of the free market that showed

1:35:04.580 --> 1:35:07.380
 how people could get better access to the free market,

1:35:07.380 --> 1:35:08.700
 how you could ensure, for instance,

1:35:08.700 --> 1:35:10.740
 that young people get onto the property ladder,

1:35:10.740 --> 1:35:11.940
 things like that.

1:35:11.940 --> 1:35:13.180
 Those are constructive things.

1:35:13.180 --> 1:35:15.260
 The people who say we must have Marxism,

1:35:15.260 --> 1:35:17.340
 I mean, don't know what the hell they're talking about,

1:35:17.340 --> 1:35:19.900
 because that never leads to any of those things.

1:35:19.900 --> 1:35:22.020
 Haven't led in the past.

1:35:22.020 --> 1:35:23.020
 It's never led in the past.

1:35:23.020 --> 1:35:25.940
 And at some point, you've got to try to work out

1:35:25.940 --> 1:35:30.300
 how many attempts you make at this damn philosophy

1:35:30.300 --> 1:35:32.540
 before you realize that every attempt always

1:35:32.540 --> 1:35:34.220
 leads to the same thing.

1:35:34.220 --> 1:35:36.740
 I would say we could pretend that fascism has never

1:35:36.740 --> 1:35:41.940
 been properly tried and that it was unfortunate what happened

1:35:41.940 --> 1:35:45.820
 in Nazi Germany, but that wasn't real fascism.

1:35:45.820 --> 1:35:49.540
 And Mussolini's fascism didn't go all that well,

1:35:49.540 --> 1:35:51.300
 but it was a bit better.

1:35:51.300 --> 1:35:54.580
 And maybe we could try a bit more Franco fascism.

1:35:54.580 --> 1:35:58.660
 Nobody would have any time for this crap, nor should they.

1:35:58.660 --> 1:36:02.120
 The people who try that are reviled, and quite rightly.

1:36:02.120 --> 1:36:04.660
 So why do we tolerate it with the Marxism thing?

1:36:04.660 --> 1:36:06.780
 And it's a great mystery to me,

1:36:06.780 --> 1:36:08.740
 the way that people do tolerate it.

1:36:08.740 --> 1:36:11.860
 Always, always in this stupid way of saying,

1:36:11.860 --> 1:36:13.900
 we haven't done it yet.

1:36:13.900 --> 1:36:16.220
 And if you keep trying the same recipe,

1:36:16.220 --> 1:36:19.140
 and every time it comes out as shit,

1:36:19.140 --> 1:36:21.260
 it's that the recipe is shit.

1:36:21.260 --> 1:36:23.420
 Well, sort of, I'm trying to practice here

1:36:23.420 --> 1:36:24.460
 by playing devil's advocate,

1:36:24.460 --> 1:36:26.460
 practice the same idea that you mentioned,

1:36:26.460 --> 1:36:29.340
 which is, when you say the word Marxism,

1:36:29.340 --> 1:36:30.700
 should you throw out everything,

1:36:30.700 --> 1:36:33.660
 or should you ask a question, is there good ideas here?

1:36:34.500 --> 1:36:36.460
 And the same, it's the good,

1:36:36.460 --> 1:36:37.780
 it's weighing the good and the bad,

1:36:37.780 --> 1:36:40.660
 and being able to do so calmly and thoughtfully.

1:36:40.660 --> 1:36:41.820
 Sure.

1:36:41.820 --> 1:36:45.580
 You know the famous George Orwell comment

1:36:45.580 --> 1:36:48.780
 on the style, in an argument with a Stalinist?

1:36:48.780 --> 1:36:49.620
 Do you know this?

1:36:49.620 --> 1:36:51.380
 That's one of my favorite quotes.

1:36:51.380 --> 1:36:52.820
 George Orwell, in the early 40s,

1:36:52.820 --> 1:36:55.900
 gets into an argument with a Stalinist.

1:36:55.900 --> 1:36:57.020
 He's also a Marxist.

1:36:58.620 --> 1:37:02.900
 And this is after the show trials, 37.

1:37:04.020 --> 1:37:06.500
 This is when it's very clear

1:37:06.500 --> 1:37:09.940
 what Marxism in the Russian form is.

1:37:10.980 --> 1:37:15.260
 And this, Orwell is in the discussion with this Marxist,

1:37:15.260 --> 1:37:16.580
 and it goes on and on,

1:37:16.580 --> 1:37:18.980
 and eventually Orwell says,

1:37:18.980 --> 1:37:20.580
 well, you know, what about the show trials,

1:37:20.580 --> 1:37:23.060
 and what about what's happened in the Ukraine,

1:37:23.060 --> 1:37:26.540
 and the famines, and much more,

1:37:26.540 --> 1:37:29.140
 and the purges, and the purges, and the purges,

1:37:29.140 --> 1:37:33.060
 and eventually the Stalinist says to Orwell

1:37:33.060 --> 1:37:35.460
 what Orwell knows he's going to say all along,

1:37:35.460 --> 1:37:36.300
 which is, he says,

1:37:36.300 --> 1:37:39.300
 you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.

1:37:40.180 --> 1:37:42.940
 And Orwell says, where's the omelet?

1:37:46.060 --> 1:37:49.580
 Oh, yeah, that's a good, that's a really good,

1:37:49.580 --> 1:37:50.420
 because that's a...

1:37:50.420 --> 1:37:52.540
 Look at this by this stage, okay?

1:37:52.540 --> 1:37:53.380
 How many...

1:37:53.380 --> 1:37:54.580
 Where's my damn omelet?

1:37:54.580 --> 1:37:59.580
 How many just messy, big, bloody, eggy piles

1:38:00.060 --> 1:38:04.660
 have the Marxists created by now in country after country?

1:38:04.660 --> 1:38:05.500
 Yeah.

1:38:05.500 --> 1:38:08.780
 Always next time they're going to produce the great omelet,

1:38:08.780 --> 1:38:11.460
 but they never have, and they never will,

1:38:11.460 --> 1:38:14.620
 because the whole thing is rotten from the start.

1:38:14.620 --> 1:38:17.500
 But let me just also say one thing about,

1:38:17.500 --> 1:38:20.700
 because of course Marx isn't as nice as he sounds,

1:38:20.700 --> 1:38:22.860
 and that's one of the things that I try

1:38:22.860 --> 1:38:24.180
 to highlight in the book is,

1:38:24.180 --> 1:38:25.940
 if we're going to do this reductive thing

1:38:25.940 --> 1:38:26.940
 of people in history and saying,

1:38:26.940 --> 1:38:29.500
 well, they had views that were of their time,

1:38:29.500 --> 1:38:32.020
 and we must therefore condemn them for them,

1:38:32.020 --> 1:38:34.180
 say, fine, let's do the same thing with Marx.

1:38:34.180 --> 1:38:35.740
 And there were things I quote in this book

1:38:35.740 --> 1:38:38.420
 from Marx's letters, not least letters to Engels,

1:38:38.420 --> 1:38:40.740
 and indeed in his published writings,

1:38:40.740 --> 1:38:43.020
 in pieces he was writing for the American press

1:38:44.060 --> 1:38:46.020
 in the 1850s,

1:38:47.220 --> 1:38:49.940
 the way he has horrible views on slavery

1:38:49.940 --> 1:38:52.980
 and colonialism and much more.

1:38:53.860 --> 1:38:54.780
 But the main thing is, I mean,

1:38:54.780 --> 1:38:57.660
 the horrible things he says about black people

1:38:57.660 --> 1:38:59.460
 and the constant use of the N word.

1:38:59.460 --> 1:39:00.780
 In fact, when I was doing the audio book

1:39:00.780 --> 1:39:03.380
 for the war in the West, I had to decide,

1:39:03.380 --> 1:39:05.740
 will I read out the quotes from Marx or not?

1:39:05.740 --> 1:39:08.900
 If I had read them out, I'd have been canceled

1:39:08.900 --> 1:39:11.260
 because people would have just said,

1:39:11.260 --> 1:39:14.460
 you've been using the N word so much in this passage.

1:39:14.460 --> 1:39:17.660
 And I slightly thought of doing it

1:39:17.660 --> 1:39:20.620
 so that I could say I was only quoting Marx

1:39:20.620 --> 1:39:22.420
 to try to hit the point home.

1:39:22.420 --> 1:39:24.260
 In the end, of course, I was sensible and decided not to,

1:39:24.260 --> 1:39:27.540
 but Marx's letters are disgusting on these terms.

1:39:27.540 --> 1:39:29.380
 Since I highlighted this in this book

1:39:29.380 --> 1:39:31.380
 and some of the media picked it up

1:39:32.900 --> 1:39:35.780
 and have popularized this thing

1:39:35.780 --> 1:39:37.340
 I'm trying to put into the system,

1:39:37.340 --> 1:39:39.420
 which is if you're gonna accuse Churchill of racism,

1:39:39.420 --> 1:39:41.580
 if you're gonna accuse Jefferson of racism,

1:39:41.580 --> 1:39:44.220
 Washington of racism, and so on, what about Marx?

1:39:44.220 --> 1:39:46.660
 The two things that Marxists have said since this came out

1:39:46.660 --> 1:39:49.380
 has been, first of all, why are you saying this about Marx?

1:39:49.380 --> 1:39:54.260
 He was a man of his time, like everyone else.

1:39:54.260 --> 1:39:55.660
 And the second thing they say is,

1:39:55.660 --> 1:39:58.860
 we don't go to Marx for his horrible abhorrent views on race.

1:39:58.860 --> 1:40:01.740
 So talking about mixed race people as gorillas and so on.

1:40:02.900 --> 1:40:04.300
 We don't go to him for that.

1:40:04.300 --> 1:40:06.580
 We go to him for his economic theories.

1:40:06.580 --> 1:40:10.180
 I say, okay, well, we don't go to Thomas Jefferson

1:40:10.180 --> 1:40:11.980
 for his views on slaves.

1:40:11.980 --> 1:40:16.980
 We don't go to Churchill for the precise language

1:40:18.820 --> 1:40:21.420
 he used that points in the 1910s about Indians.

1:40:21.420 --> 1:40:22.820
 Or his health advice.

1:40:22.820 --> 1:40:24.620
 Or his health advice.

1:40:24.620 --> 1:40:26.980
 Actually, I do get him for that.

1:40:26.980 --> 1:40:28.620
 That explains so much.

1:40:28.620 --> 1:40:31.780
 But let's have some standards on this.

1:40:31.780 --> 1:40:34.340
 And that's why I'm very suspicious of the fact

1:40:34.340 --> 1:40:36.100
 that the people don't do this with Marx

1:40:36.100 --> 1:40:37.140
 because I think what they're trying,

1:40:37.140 --> 1:40:38.380
 what some people are trying to do,

1:40:38.380 --> 1:40:40.060
 and this may sound conspiratorial,

1:40:40.060 --> 1:40:41.500
 but I really don't think it is.

1:40:41.500 --> 1:40:43.540
 I think that some people are deliberately trying

1:40:43.540 --> 1:40:47.220
 to completely clear the cultural landscape of our past

1:40:47.220 --> 1:40:49.660
 in order to say there's nothing good.

1:40:49.660 --> 1:40:51.100
 Nothing you can hold on to.

1:40:51.100 --> 1:40:52.340
 No one you should revere.

1:40:52.340 --> 1:40:53.820
 You've got no heroes.

1:40:53.820 --> 1:40:55.180
 The whole thing comes down.

1:40:55.180 --> 1:40:56.220
 Who's left standing?

1:40:56.220 --> 1:40:58.460
 Oh, we've also got this idea from the 20th century

1:40:58.460 --> 1:41:00.500
 still about Marxism.

1:41:00.500 --> 1:41:02.540
 Well, the 19th and 20th centuries.

1:41:02.540 --> 1:41:05.340
 And no, no.

1:41:05.340 --> 1:41:09.740
 You will not have the entire landscape deracinated.

1:41:09.740 --> 1:41:13.060
 And then the worst ideas tried again.

1:41:13.060 --> 1:41:15.100
 So basically destroy all of history

1:41:15.100 --> 1:41:16.580
 and the lessons learned from history

1:41:16.580 --> 1:41:17.860
 and then start from scratch.

1:41:17.860 --> 1:41:20.740
 And then it's completely any idea can work

1:41:20.740 --> 1:41:22.340
 and then you could just take whatever.

1:41:22.340 --> 1:41:24.380
 Well, and the thing is there are always some people

1:41:24.380 --> 1:41:25.940
 with pre preferred ideas.

1:41:25.940 --> 1:41:27.940
 And I mentioned this also with the postcolonialists.

1:41:27.940 --> 1:41:30.660
 The postcolonialists were really interesting

1:41:30.660 --> 1:41:33.300
 because when the European powers were moving

1:41:33.300 --> 1:41:34.820
 from Africa and the Far East,

1:41:35.700 --> 1:41:38.740
 postcolonial movements had one obvious move

1:41:38.740 --> 1:41:41.340
 they could have done, which was to say,

1:41:41.340 --> 1:41:43.260
 since the European powers have left,

1:41:43.260 --> 1:41:46.420
 we will return to a pre colonial life,

1:41:46.420 --> 1:41:48.300
 which in some of their places would have been returning

1:41:48.300 --> 1:41:50.620
 to slave markets and slave ownership

1:41:50.620 --> 1:41:52.500
 and slave selling and much more.

1:41:52.500 --> 1:41:54.300
 But put that aside for a second.

1:41:54.300 --> 1:41:56.300
 They could have said we have an indigenous culture

1:41:56.300 --> 1:41:58.100
 which we will return to.

1:41:58.100 --> 1:42:01.100
 Almost uniformly in the postcolonial era,

1:42:01.100 --> 1:42:04.100
 you had figures like France Fanon,

1:42:04.100 --> 1:42:06.580
 you had European intellectuals like Sartre,

1:42:06.580 --> 1:42:09.780
 who said the Western powers are retreating

1:42:09.780 --> 1:42:12.140
 from these countries and therefore we should institute

1:42:12.140 --> 1:42:14.940
 in these countries what but Western Marxism.

1:42:17.060 --> 1:42:20.020
 Well, it's not obvious to me that like the bad ideas

1:42:20.020 --> 1:42:21.300
 will be the ones that emerge,

1:42:21.300 --> 1:42:23.660
 but it's more likely the bad ideas would emerge

1:42:23.660 --> 1:42:26.540
 in this kind of context when you erase history,

1:42:26.540 --> 1:42:27.380
 when you erase tradition.

1:42:27.380 --> 1:42:30.300
 When you erase history and you leave some ideas

1:42:30.300 --> 1:42:33.500
 deliberately uninterrogated.

1:42:33.500 --> 1:42:37.980
 I mean, as I say, find me one in a hundred

1:42:37.980 --> 1:42:40.180
 American students who've heard of

1:42:42.500 --> 1:42:45.460
 any of the communist despots of the 20th century.

1:42:47.260 --> 1:42:49.500
 I mean, name recognition in,

1:42:49.500 --> 1:42:52.260
 there was a poll done a few years ago in the UK

1:42:52.260 --> 1:42:56.380
 and like name recognition among children,

1:42:56.380 --> 1:43:01.380
 school children for Stalin, let alone Mao.

1:43:01.380 --> 1:43:05.780
 I mean, Mao who kills more people than anyone,

1:43:05.780 --> 1:43:09.500
 65 million Chinese, perhaps.

1:43:09.500 --> 1:43:13.100
 How many students in America know what Mao was,

1:43:13.100 --> 1:43:16.460
 who he was, where he was, nothing.

1:43:16.460 --> 1:43:17.900
 Or the atrocities committed.

1:43:17.900 --> 1:43:19.340
 Where the atrocities were committed.

1:43:19.340 --> 1:43:21.700
 And I worry about that because it means

1:43:21.700 --> 1:43:24.580
 that we might have learned one of the two lessons

1:43:24.580 --> 1:43:26.100
 of the 20th century.

1:43:26.100 --> 1:43:29.420
 We think we've learned one of the two lessons

1:43:29.420 --> 1:43:30.300
 of the 20th century.

1:43:30.300 --> 1:43:32.060
 We actually haven't learned that lesson.

1:43:32.060 --> 1:43:33.820
 We've learned a little bit of it.

1:43:33.820 --> 1:43:35.780
 And we've not learned the other one at all.

1:43:35.780 --> 1:43:37.660
 Because that's why we still have people

1:43:37.660 --> 1:43:39.340
 in American politics and elsewhere

1:43:39.340 --> 1:43:42.740
 actually talking about collectivization and things.

1:43:42.740 --> 1:43:44.740
 As if there's no problem with that.

1:43:44.740 --> 1:43:46.580
 And as if it's perfectly obvious.

1:43:46.580 --> 1:43:48.100
 And they could run it and they'd know

1:43:48.100 --> 1:43:49.540
 exactly where to stop.

1:43:49.540 --> 1:43:51.420
 What are the two lessons of the 20th century?

1:43:51.420 --> 1:43:52.740
 Fascism and communism.

1:43:55.260 --> 1:43:56.420
 Yeah.

1:43:56.420 --> 1:44:00.900
 I mean, I'm not exactly sure what exactly the lessons are.

1:44:00.900 --> 1:44:02.020
 No, it's not clear.

1:44:02.020 --> 1:44:03.540
 If the lessons were very clear,

1:44:03.540 --> 1:44:04.900
 we'd be better at it.

1:44:04.900 --> 1:44:08.260
 Well, one is your book broadly applied

1:44:08.260 --> 1:44:10.580
 of madness of crowds.

1:44:10.580 --> 1:44:11.860
 That's one lesson.

1:44:11.860 --> 1:44:14.060
 Well, how so?

1:44:14.060 --> 1:44:19.060
 Meaning like large crowds can display herd like behavior.

1:44:19.300 --> 1:44:21.260
 Yes, be very suspicious of crowds.

1:44:21.260 --> 1:44:22.100
 Yeah.

1:44:22.100 --> 1:44:24.100
 In general, I mean, you apply it in different,

1:44:24.100 --> 1:44:25.740
 more to modern application.

1:44:25.740 --> 1:44:26.580
 Yeah.

1:44:26.580 --> 1:44:29.580
 In a sense, but that's rooted in history,

1:44:29.580 --> 1:44:32.420
 that crowds can, when humans get together,

1:44:32.420 --> 1:44:35.500
 they can do some quite radically silly things.

1:44:35.500 --> 1:44:38.260
 Elias Kaneti is very good on that, crowds and power.

1:44:40.460 --> 1:44:43.940
 And Eric Hoffer, who is a sort of self taught, amazing,

1:44:45.660 --> 1:44:47.900
 not to say autodidactic writer,

1:44:47.900 --> 1:44:49.220
 the true believer and so on.

1:44:49.220 --> 1:44:51.420
 He was extremely good on that.

1:44:51.420 --> 1:44:52.740
 But the reason I mentioned the two things,

1:44:52.740 --> 1:44:53.860
 no, I mean, we should have realized

1:44:53.860 --> 1:44:57.540
 the two nightmares of the 20th century fascism and communism,

1:44:57.540 --> 1:45:00.020
 that we should know how they came about.

1:45:00.020 --> 1:45:01.220
 And we're interested in learning

1:45:01.220 --> 1:45:03.180
 how one of them came about, fascism.

1:45:03.180 --> 1:45:04.780
 And we know some of the lessons,

1:45:04.780 --> 1:45:08.340
 like don't treat other people as less than you

1:45:08.340 --> 1:45:10.180
 because of their race.

1:45:10.180 --> 1:45:12.140
 That's one lesson.

1:45:12.140 --> 1:45:16.260
 But we've done some good at learning that.

1:45:17.500 --> 1:45:20.580
 But the second one, not to do communism again,

1:45:20.580 --> 1:45:25.580
 not to do socialism, I think we're way away from knowing

1:45:26.540 --> 1:45:29.500
 because we don't know how it happened.

1:45:29.500 --> 1:45:32.620
 And the little temptations are still there always.

1:45:32.620 --> 1:45:33.460
 Look at people saying,

1:45:33.460 --> 1:45:35.700
 I'm gonna expropriate your property.

1:45:39.020 --> 1:45:40.500
 If people do things they don't like,

1:45:40.500 --> 1:45:42.940
 they will get, we can't wait to take your property.

1:45:42.940 --> 1:45:45.780
 Well, there's a sense, there's an appealing sense.

1:45:45.780 --> 1:45:50.780
 Okay, every ideology has an appealing narrative behind it

1:45:50.900 --> 1:45:52.500
 that sells the ideology.

1:45:52.500 --> 1:45:57.140
 So for socialism, for communism is that there's a,

1:45:57.140 --> 1:45:59.740
 it seems unfair that the working class

1:45:59.740 --> 1:46:04.740
 does all of this work and gets only a fraction of the output.

1:46:05.060 --> 1:46:07.020
 It just seems unfair.

1:46:07.020 --> 1:46:07.860
 So you wanna make it.

1:46:07.860 --> 1:46:10.140
 If they do get a fraction of the output, yes.

1:46:10.140 --> 1:46:14.900
 Yes, and so it seems to be more fair

1:46:14.900 --> 1:46:16.260
 if we increase that.

1:46:16.260 --> 1:46:21.260
 If the workers own all of the value of their output

1:46:21.500 --> 1:46:26.500
 and things that are more fair seems to be a good thing.

1:46:26.780 --> 1:46:28.860
 I'd say, well, yeah, I mean, fairness is,

1:46:29.900 --> 1:46:32.460
 I like fairness as a term.

1:46:32.460 --> 1:46:33.820
 No, I much prefer fairness

1:46:33.820 --> 1:46:36.860
 because it's a much easier thing to try to work out.

1:46:36.860 --> 1:46:38.660
 It's quite amorphous itself as a concept,

1:46:38.660 --> 1:46:40.820
 but everyone can recognize it.

1:46:40.820 --> 1:46:45.820
 So for instance, should the boss of the company

1:46:47.100 --> 1:46:51.300
 earn a million times that of the lowest paid employee?

1:46:51.300 --> 1:46:52.420
 Doesn't seem fair.

1:46:53.700 --> 1:46:57.820
 Should they earn maybe five or 10 times

1:46:57.820 --> 1:47:00.620
 the salary of the lowest employee?

1:47:00.620 --> 1:47:03.380
 Yeah, possibly, that could be fair.

1:47:03.380 --> 1:47:05.060
 There are certain sort of multiples

1:47:05.060 --> 1:47:11.060
 which are within the bounds of reasonableness.

1:47:12.540 --> 1:47:17.260
 I think actually that's the much bigger problem

1:47:17.260 --> 1:47:19.220
 in capitalism at the moment as I see it

1:47:19.220 --> 1:47:22.900
 is the not untrue perception

1:47:22.900 --> 1:47:27.900
 that a tiny number of people accrue a lot of the benefits

1:47:27.900 --> 1:47:34.620
 and that the bit in the middle

1:47:34.620 --> 1:47:37.140
 has become increasingly squeezed

1:47:37.140 --> 1:47:38.940
 and is at danger always of falling

1:47:38.940 --> 1:47:40.300
 all the way down to the bottom.

1:47:40.300 --> 1:47:41.780
 I mean, I think in the snakes and ladders

1:47:41.780 --> 1:47:43.460
 of American capitalism, for instance,

1:47:43.460 --> 1:47:46.580
 it's a correct perception to say

1:47:46.580 --> 1:47:50.580
 that the snakes go down awfully far.

1:47:51.700 --> 1:47:53.980
 If you tread on the snake,

1:47:53.980 --> 1:47:56.700
 you can plummet an awfully long way in America.

1:47:56.700 --> 1:48:01.700
 And the deal in the game was that the ladders took you high

1:48:02.500 --> 1:48:03.980
 and there's a perception, and again,

1:48:03.980 --> 1:48:07.220
 it's not entirely wrong that the ladder system

1:48:07.220 --> 1:48:08.820
 on the board is kind of broken.

1:48:10.460 --> 1:48:13.460
 So what you're saying is you're a Marxist.

1:48:13.460 --> 1:48:15.460
 I'm not saying I'm a Marxist.

1:48:15.460 --> 1:48:20.460
 You heard that here first in the out of context blog post

1:48:20.460 --> 1:48:21.460
 you're going to write about this.

1:48:21.460 --> 1:48:22.820
 I get to that, I get back to this point.

1:48:22.820 --> 1:48:24.740
 The way to critique capitalism,

1:48:24.740 --> 1:48:28.100
 if it's gone bad, is to get better capitalists.

1:48:28.100 --> 1:48:31.300
 Free markets where they're not fair should be made fair.

1:48:31.300 --> 1:48:35.060
 Never decide that the answer is the thing

1:48:35.060 --> 1:48:39.580
 that has never produced any human flourishing, i.e. Marxism.

1:48:39.580 --> 1:48:41.900
 So as you describe in The Madness of Crowds

1:48:41.900 --> 1:48:45.580
 the herd like behavior of humans that gets us into trouble,

1:48:47.900 --> 1:48:51.900
 you as an individual thinker and others listening to this,

1:48:51.900 --> 1:48:54.980
 how can you, because all of us are mids crowds,

1:48:54.980 --> 1:48:57.820
 we're influenced by the society that's around us,

1:48:57.820 --> 1:48:59.140
 by the people that's around us.

1:48:59.140 --> 1:49:00.740
 How can we think independently?

1:49:01.740 --> 1:49:06.740
 How can we, if you're in the Soviet Union

1:49:09.580 --> 1:49:11.420
 at the beginning of the 20th century,

1:49:12.420 --> 1:49:16.940
 if you're in, I don't know, Nazi Germany

1:49:16.940 --> 1:49:18.980
 at the end of the 30s or the 40s,

1:49:18.980 --> 1:49:20.660
 how can you think independently?

1:49:20.660 --> 1:49:25.660
 Given, first of all, that it's hard to think independently,

1:49:26.860 --> 1:49:28.540
 just intellectually speaking,

1:49:28.540 --> 1:49:33.540
 but also that it just becomes more and more dangerous.

1:49:33.700 --> 1:49:36.780
 So the incentive to think independently

1:49:36.780 --> 1:49:40.180
 under the uncertainty that's usually involved with thinking

1:49:40.180 --> 1:49:42.860
 is, I mean, it's a silly thing to say,

1:49:42.860 --> 1:49:44.660
 but on Twitter there is a cost to be paid

1:49:44.660 --> 1:49:49.580
 for going against the crowd on any silly thing.

1:49:49.580 --> 1:49:52.860
 We can even talk about, what is it?

1:49:52.860 --> 1:49:55.620
 Will Smith slapping Chris Rock.

1:49:55.620 --> 1:49:59.060
 There's a crowd that believes that that was unjustified.

1:49:59.060 --> 1:50:00.980
 I forget what the crowd decided.

1:50:00.980 --> 1:50:01.820
 But I don't.

1:50:01.820 --> 1:50:02.700
 Crowd split on that one.

1:50:02.700 --> 1:50:04.620
 It's safe to have one opinion either way.

1:50:04.620 --> 1:50:05.580
 Okay, it is, right.

1:50:05.580 --> 1:50:07.900
 But there is, you put it very nicely,

1:50:07.900 --> 1:50:10.260
 that there's clearly a calculus here

1:50:10.260 --> 1:50:12.620
 and that you can measure, on Twitter in particular,

1:50:12.620 --> 1:50:14.380
 you can measure kind of the crowd,

1:50:14.380 --> 1:50:16.100
 a sense of where the crowd lays.

1:50:16.100 --> 1:50:17.060
 Michael Jackson.

1:50:17.060 --> 1:50:17.900
 Mm hmm.

1:50:19.300 --> 1:50:20.660
 Well, oh boy.

1:50:22.420 --> 1:50:26.060
 I don't want to, this is not a legal discussion.

1:50:26.060 --> 1:50:27.980
 I don't have my lawyer present.

1:50:27.980 --> 1:50:29.060
 I don't even have a lawyer.

1:50:29.060 --> 1:50:30.500
 The man in question is dead.

1:50:30.500 --> 1:50:33.860
 But I think most people who are not just diehard fans

1:50:33.860 --> 1:50:35.020
 would concede that Michael Jackson

1:50:35.020 --> 1:50:37.020
 had a strange relationship with children

1:50:37.020 --> 1:50:40.900
 and was almost certainly a pedophile.

1:50:42.060 --> 1:50:45.180
 Is that, was that, did the crowd agree on that?

1:50:45.180 --> 1:50:47.020
 No, the crowd hasn't agreed because he's too famous

1:50:47.020 --> 1:50:48.460
 and we all love Thriller.

1:50:48.460 --> 1:50:49.540
 Yeah, we do.

1:50:49.540 --> 1:50:52.460
 So you said people who are not fans, I just don't.

1:50:52.460 --> 1:50:53.900
 No, I'm a fan of Michael Jackson,

1:50:53.900 --> 1:50:56.620
 but I think he was almost certainly a pedophile.

1:50:56.620 --> 1:51:01.500
 And, but nobody wants to give up dancing to bad at weddings.

1:51:01.500 --> 1:51:04.300
 So they just kind of added in.

1:51:04.300 --> 1:51:05.860
 It's fine.

1:51:05.860 --> 1:51:07.340
 Seriously, it's a genius.

1:51:07.340 --> 1:51:10.660
 Your law does not apply to Bill Cosby.

1:51:12.020 --> 1:51:14.340
 Well, he wasn't, he was, of course,

1:51:14.340 --> 1:51:16.660
 one of the most famous people in America.

1:51:16.660 --> 1:51:18.700
 But maybe he wasn't regarded as talented.

1:51:19.580 --> 1:51:22.780
 Oh, oh wow, there's depth to this calculation.

1:51:22.780 --> 1:51:25.060
 There's a genius opt out in all cultures.

1:51:26.140 --> 1:51:27.540
 There's a genius opt out in all cultures.

1:51:27.540 --> 1:51:28.580
 Look at Lord Byron.

1:51:28.580 --> 1:51:30.100
 Lord Byron shagged his sister.

1:51:31.340 --> 1:51:32.820
 Doesn't affect his reputation.

1:51:32.820 --> 1:51:34.900
 In fact, if anything, it kind of adds to it.

1:51:34.900 --> 1:51:38.380
 But then again, this kind of war against the West,

1:51:38.380 --> 1:51:41.700
 genius is actually makes you more likely,

1:51:41.700 --> 1:51:43.780
 or no, to get canceled.

1:51:43.780 --> 1:51:47.740
 So if you look at the genius of Thomas Jefferson, or...

1:51:47.740 --> 1:51:50.020
 Well, yes, because if you haven't done anything remarkable,

1:51:50.020 --> 1:51:53.020
 nobody will come looking for you passively, yeah.

1:51:53.020 --> 1:51:56.020
 Oh, so genius can get you in trouble eventually.

1:51:56.020 --> 1:51:58.060
 Sidle through life with nobody noticing.

1:51:58.060 --> 1:52:00.540
 Be totally harmless and then die

1:52:00.540 --> 1:52:02.700
 and hope you haven't used any carbon.

1:52:05.700 --> 1:52:08.980
 But you were asking about how to survive

1:52:08.980 --> 1:52:13.180
 the era of social media, as it were, and the crowds.

1:52:13.180 --> 1:52:15.500
 And there's a very simple answer to that.

1:52:15.500 --> 1:52:20.500
 Don't overrate the significance of the unreal world.

1:52:22.180 --> 1:52:25.260
 Oh, come on, but this is still human psychology.

1:52:25.260 --> 1:52:26.180
 Because you want to fit in.

1:52:26.180 --> 1:52:27.420
 There's a, you want to...

1:52:27.420 --> 1:52:28.860
 Why?

1:52:28.860 --> 1:52:31.860
 Because you like people, and you're just as a...

1:52:31.860 --> 1:52:33.460
 Why not just like a small number of people

1:52:33.460 --> 1:52:34.700
 and ignore the rest?

1:52:34.700 --> 1:52:36.060
 Yeah, that's...

1:52:36.060 --> 1:52:37.300
 That's what I do.

1:52:37.300 --> 1:52:39.620
 Well, I mean, I actually like most people,

1:52:39.620 --> 1:52:40.700
 and that isn't a general thing.

1:52:40.700 --> 1:52:44.420
 I don't have detestation for most people at all.

1:52:44.420 --> 1:52:48.460
 Most people I kind of enjoy speaking with and being with.

1:52:48.460 --> 1:52:52.500
 But in terms of storing your sense of self worth

1:52:52.500 --> 1:52:54.900
 in absolute strangers, big mistake.

1:52:54.900 --> 1:52:56.940
 Yeah, well, me, that's...

1:52:56.940 --> 1:52:58.980
 Listen, let's turn into a therapy session.

1:52:58.980 --> 1:53:01.140
 Because for me, and I think I represent

1:53:01.140 --> 1:53:03.900
 some number of population, is I'm pretty self critical.

1:53:03.900 --> 1:53:06.020
 I'm looking for myself in the world.

1:53:06.020 --> 1:53:09.020
 And there is a depth of connection

1:53:09.020 --> 1:53:10.780
 with people on the internet.

1:53:10.780 --> 1:53:11.620
 I mean, I have some...

1:53:11.620 --> 1:53:13.300
 I think there's a shallowness of it.

1:53:13.300 --> 1:53:14.660
 It's shallow connection.

1:53:14.660 --> 1:53:15.900
 Interesting, I...

1:53:15.900 --> 1:53:16.740
 Put it this way.

1:53:16.740 --> 1:53:21.060
 If you became very ill tomorrow, would any of them help?

1:53:21.060 --> 1:53:21.900
 On the internet?

1:53:21.900 --> 1:53:22.740
 No, no.

1:53:22.740 --> 1:53:24.140
 Good, that's a good test.

1:53:24.140 --> 1:53:25.100
 Yeah, that's a good test.

1:53:25.100 --> 1:53:27.820
 But then at the end of the day, yeah, you're right.

1:53:27.820 --> 1:53:30.020
 Your very close friends would help, family would help.

1:53:30.020 --> 1:53:32.900
 Yeah, and perhaps that's the only thing...

1:53:32.900 --> 1:53:39.220
 You can't store significant amounts of trust,

1:53:39.220 --> 1:53:43.180
 or faith, or belief, or self worth

1:53:43.180 --> 1:53:45.660
 in places which will not return it to you.

1:53:46.780 --> 1:53:49.220
 Okay, so let's talk about the more extreme case,

1:53:49.220 --> 1:53:50.060
 the harsher case.

1:53:50.060 --> 1:53:53.340
 When you talk about the things you talk about

1:53:53.340 --> 1:53:57.940
 in the war on the West and madness of crowds,

1:53:57.940 --> 1:54:02.940
 I mean, you're getting a lot of blowback, I'm sure.

1:54:03.820 --> 1:54:07.300
 As for the listener, you just shrugged lightly.

1:54:07.300 --> 1:54:09.420
 It was a zen like look on your face.

1:54:10.460 --> 1:54:12.180
 So you don't...

1:54:12.180 --> 1:54:14.820
 All you need is Sam Harris to say

1:54:14.820 --> 1:54:16.860
 that you're brilliant and you're happy.

1:54:16.860 --> 1:54:20.340
 No, no, I love Sam.

1:54:20.340 --> 1:54:21.780
 Yeah.

1:54:21.780 --> 1:54:24.060
 Deeply pleased when he flatters me, but I mean,

1:54:24.060 --> 1:54:27.780
 and he's nice about me, but no, I don't just rely on Sam.

1:54:27.780 --> 1:54:32.460
 No, I mean, why would I mind?

1:54:32.460 --> 1:54:34.180
 I mean, maybe it's self selecting.

1:54:34.180 --> 1:54:37.980
 If I didn't have the view I had about that,

1:54:37.980 --> 1:54:40.780
 or whatever armory it is that I have on that,

1:54:40.780 --> 1:54:42.460
 I wouldn't do what I did, maybe.

1:54:43.420 --> 1:54:45.900
 I mean, have you been to some dark places psychologically

1:54:45.900 --> 1:54:48.980
 because of the challenging ideas you explore?

1:54:48.980 --> 1:54:52.180
 So like significant self doubt, just kind of...

1:54:52.180 --> 1:54:55.500
 I can't say I've been unaffected by everything in my life.

1:54:55.500 --> 1:54:58.500
 By any means, that would make me an automaton of some kind.

1:55:01.100 --> 1:55:02.980
 There's definitely times I've got things wrong

1:55:02.980 --> 1:55:04.180
 and regretted that.

1:55:05.500 --> 1:55:08.180
 There's times I've...

1:55:10.260 --> 1:55:13.700
 There was a period around the time I wrote my book,

1:55:13.700 --> 1:55:15.580
 The Strange Death of Europe,

1:55:15.580 --> 1:55:20.580
 which was a very, very dark time.

1:55:21.220 --> 1:55:25.180
 And it wasn't because I was having a dark time in my life,

1:55:25.180 --> 1:55:27.340
 but because of the book I was writing.

1:55:27.340 --> 1:55:30.180
 Oh, because of the places you had to go

1:55:30.180 --> 1:55:32.220
 in order to write that book.

1:55:32.220 --> 1:55:35.540
 And, well, I was contemplating the end of a civilization.

1:55:35.540 --> 1:55:40.420
 So occasionally now I have maybe slightly too pat

1:55:40.420 --> 1:55:43.580
 at this stage, but sometimes readers come up to me

1:55:43.580 --> 1:55:44.820
 in the street or whatever and say,

1:55:44.820 --> 1:55:47.780
 you know, I love The Strange Death of Europe.

1:55:47.780 --> 1:55:50.700
 And will say, you know, very depressing book to read,

1:55:50.700 --> 1:55:53.020
 however, I would say, well, you should have tried

1:55:53.020 --> 1:55:53.860
 writing it.

1:55:53.860 --> 1:55:58.860
 But it was because, I mean, it has chunks of it,

1:56:01.460 --> 1:56:02.820
 which I'm very proud of in particular

1:56:02.820 --> 1:56:06.980
 about the death of religion, the death of God,

1:56:06.980 --> 1:56:11.740
 the loss of meaning and the void.

1:56:11.740 --> 1:56:14.940
 And that's difficult stuff to write about

1:56:14.940 --> 1:56:17.020
 and to grapple with.

1:56:17.020 --> 1:56:20.660
 And there is a sort of, I haven't reread that book

1:56:20.660 --> 1:56:21.740
 since it came out,

1:56:21.740 --> 1:56:25.340
 but I think there are passages in it

1:56:25.340 --> 1:56:28.260
 which reveal what I was thinking very clearly

1:56:28.260 --> 1:56:33.000
 in the poetry of it, as it were, as well as the detail.

1:56:34.860 --> 1:56:39.860
 But, yeah, I can't say, I'm used to saying

1:56:43.340 --> 1:56:46.180
 what I think and what I see.

1:56:46.180 --> 1:56:49.380
 And if there's any pushback I've got from that,

1:56:49.380 --> 1:56:51.740
 I'm completely consoled that I'm saying what I see

1:56:51.740 --> 1:56:53.040
 with my own eyes.

1:56:54.740 --> 1:56:56.100
 That's your source of strength,

1:56:56.100 --> 1:56:59.540
 is that you're always seeking the truth as best you see it.

1:56:59.540 --> 1:57:03.180
 Well, I can't agree to go along with a lie

1:57:03.180 --> 1:57:05.180
 if I've seen something with my own eyes.

1:57:06.840 --> 1:57:09.320
 Do you ever, so speaking of Sam Harris,

1:57:10.540 --> 1:57:13.340
 and I mentioned to you offline, a lot of people,

1:57:13.340 --> 1:57:16.100
 I talk to a lot of smart people in my private life

1:57:16.100 --> 1:57:18.980
 on this podcast, and a lot of them will reference you

1:57:18.980 --> 1:57:22.160
 as their example of a very smart person.

1:57:23.300 --> 1:57:28.300
 So given that compliment, do you ever worry

1:57:29.260 --> 1:57:33.700
 that your sort of ego grows to a level

1:57:33.700 --> 1:57:38.100
 where what you think is the truth is no longer the truth?

1:57:38.100 --> 1:57:43.100
 Is this kind of, it blinds you?

1:57:44.420 --> 1:57:46.620
 And also, on top of that,

1:57:46.620 --> 1:57:50.620
 the fact that you stand against the crowd often,

1:57:50.620 --> 1:57:52.540
 that there's part of it that appeals to you,

1:57:52.540 --> 1:57:56.380
 that you like to point out the emperor has no clothes.

1:57:56.380 --> 1:57:58.540
 I get a certain thrill from the friction.

1:57:58.540 --> 1:58:02.700
 Yeah, that sometimes both your ego

1:58:02.700 --> 1:58:06.100
 and the thrill of friction will get you

1:58:06.100 --> 1:58:08.840
 to deviate from the truth and instead,

1:58:08.840 --> 1:58:10.500
 just look for the friction.

1:58:10.500 --> 1:58:12.380
 Could do, could do for sure.

1:58:13.940 --> 1:58:16.100
 I try to keep alive to that.

1:58:16.100 --> 1:58:20.380
 I mean, early in my career, I realized that, for instance,

1:58:20.380 --> 1:58:24.180
 I didn't want to make enemies unnecessarily,

1:58:25.060 --> 1:58:26.420
 any more than strictly necessary,

1:58:26.420 --> 1:58:27.980
 because there was a very large number

1:58:27.980 --> 1:58:30.220
 of already necessary enemies.

1:58:30.220 --> 1:58:31.860
 And I remember once, I won't go into the details,

1:58:31.860 --> 1:58:35.500
 but I already had one sort of thing I'd done that week,

1:58:35.500 --> 1:58:36.540
 and then another thing came out,

1:58:36.540 --> 1:58:39.380
 and I just thought, I can't, I can't do that.

1:58:39.380 --> 1:58:42.340
 And I remember thinking, don't be the sort of person

1:58:42.340 --> 1:58:46.220
 who's forever creating storms,

1:58:46.220 --> 1:58:47.980
 and I tried to make sure I wasn't.

1:58:47.980 --> 1:58:51.100
 And I think I've pretty much stuck to that.

1:58:51.100 --> 1:58:52.500
 But to answer your question,

1:58:54.420 --> 1:58:58.660
 well, the first thing is I'm as confident as I can be

1:58:58.660 --> 1:59:01.500
 that I wouldn't fall into the trap you described.

1:59:01.500 --> 1:59:02.340
 Two reasons.

1:59:03.860 --> 1:59:05.500
 I mean, one is that I don't think of myself

1:59:05.500 --> 1:59:07.220
 as a wildly intelligent person,

1:59:09.100 --> 1:59:11.380
 partly because I'm very, very aware

1:59:11.380 --> 1:59:13.980
 of the things I know nothing about.

1:59:13.980 --> 1:59:17.380
 I mean, for instance, I have almost no knowledge

1:59:17.380 --> 1:59:22.380
 of the details of finance or economic theory.

1:59:26.340 --> 1:59:28.140
 I mean, the real details.

1:59:28.140 --> 1:59:29.740
 I don't mean the big picture of the kind

1:59:29.740 --> 1:59:30.860
 that we were just discussing earlier,

1:59:30.860 --> 1:59:35.860
 but I have, if you put the periodic table in front of me,

1:59:35.860 --> 1:59:39.420
 the periodic table in front of me,

1:59:39.420 --> 1:59:44.420
 I would struggle to do more than a handful.

1:59:47.740 --> 1:59:52.740
 I am very conscious of huge gaps in my knowledge.

1:59:53.940 --> 1:59:57.020
 And where I have gaps or chasms,

1:59:57.020 --> 1:59:59.300
 I tend to find that I have a disproportionate admiration

1:59:59.300 --> 2:00:01.500
 for the people who know that stuff.

2:00:01.500 --> 2:00:04.540
 Like I'm wildly impressed by people who understand money,

2:00:04.540 --> 2:00:06.060
 really understand it, because I think,

2:00:06.060 --> 2:00:07.460
 how the hell do you do that?

2:00:09.860 --> 2:00:14.780
 And the same thing with biologists, medics,

2:00:14.780 --> 2:00:17.580
 stuff I just know very little about.

2:00:17.580 --> 2:00:19.580
 And that's a source of humility for you, just knowing that.

2:00:19.580 --> 2:00:21.620
 Yes, I mean, I think, well, I can get on that stuff,

2:00:21.620 --> 2:00:25.300
 but I mean, Jesus, if you got me on the general knowledge.

2:00:25.300 --> 2:00:26.780
 I would say that thing, some years ago,

2:00:26.780 --> 2:00:29.580
 there's a thing in the UK called University Challenge.

2:00:29.580 --> 2:00:34.580
 And I was asked some years ago on to,

2:00:34.660 --> 2:00:36.180
 there's a sort of psych celebrity,

2:00:36.180 --> 2:00:40.100
 one of former students of the universities or colleges

2:00:40.100 --> 2:00:42.420
 asked to go back for the Christmas special.

2:00:42.420 --> 2:00:45.780
 And I was asked to be one of the people from my old college

2:00:45.780 --> 2:00:49.180
 to go back and compete in the sort of celebrity alumni one.

2:00:49.180 --> 2:00:50.500
 And the only thing I actually wanted to do,

2:00:50.500 --> 2:00:52.020
 it was go discover the Louis Theroux

2:00:52.020 --> 2:00:53.580
 had been to my college before my time.

2:00:53.580 --> 2:00:55.780
 And he was on, he'd agreed to be on the team.

2:00:55.780 --> 2:00:57.700
 And I thought, well, I'd love to meet Louis Theroux,

2:00:57.700 --> 2:00:58.980
 that'd be great fun.

2:00:58.980 --> 2:01:01.900
 And anyhow, and I said, well, I really don't want to do it.

2:01:01.900 --> 2:01:03.220
 And they said, come on, you'd be great.

2:01:03.220 --> 2:01:05.020
 I said, I wouldn't, I'd show myself up

2:01:05.020 --> 2:01:07.380
 to be a total asshole and ignoramus.

2:01:07.380 --> 2:01:10.780
 And as it was, I sat down my flat

2:01:10.780 --> 2:01:13.980
 and I watched some past episodes of University Challenge.

2:01:14.940 --> 2:01:19.260
 I realized I'd have just sat mute for the whole half hour.

2:01:20.540 --> 2:01:23.220
 I just couldn't, the first question was about physics.

2:01:23.220 --> 2:01:25.980
 And the second one was about, as it was,

2:01:25.980 --> 2:01:29.180
 I watched the one and I could answer the first two

2:01:29.180 --> 2:01:32.180
 or three questions of the one that actually went out

2:01:32.180 --> 2:01:34.260
 because they made it a bit simpler.

2:01:35.340 --> 2:01:37.820
 But I mean, I'm terribly conscious of the,

2:01:37.820 --> 2:01:39.980
 and I said to the producers, I said, I can't go on

2:01:39.980 --> 2:01:42.060
 because I mean, I just couldn't answer the questions.

2:01:42.060 --> 2:01:44.660
 These unbelievably smart students seem to be able to answer

2:01:44.660 --> 2:01:46.060
 on a whole range of things.

2:01:46.060 --> 2:01:51.060
 So I'm perfectly aware of my limitations and...

2:01:51.340 --> 2:01:53.540
 You contemplate your limitations.

2:01:53.540 --> 2:01:56.300
 Yeah, and they're forever before me, you know.

2:01:56.300 --> 2:01:58.860
 They're not hard to find in every day.

2:01:58.860 --> 2:02:01.660
 And then on top of that, I suppose, it's,

2:02:03.060 --> 2:02:06.660
 in a way, you know that line from Rudyard Kipling's

2:02:08.460 --> 2:02:12.700
 alternately brilliant and slightly nauseating poem, If?

2:02:13.780 --> 2:02:14.980
 There's a line.

2:02:14.980 --> 2:02:16.940
 You just enjoy a good poem, can you?

2:02:16.940 --> 2:02:21.220
 Well, no, it's not, I can enjoy a great poem.

2:02:21.220 --> 2:02:23.180
 But I mean, a good poem.

2:02:23.180 --> 2:02:25.380
 This is, you know, slightly off.

2:02:25.380 --> 2:02:26.940
 But, well, it's up to you.

2:02:26.940 --> 2:02:29.500
 This goes to your criticism of Dostoevsky.

2:02:29.500 --> 2:02:34.500
 Take Douglas's criticism with a grain of salt, so.

2:02:34.700 --> 2:02:37.700
 Maybe I've read it too many memorial services and things.

2:02:37.700 --> 2:02:41.860
 But that line is a good piece of advice.

2:02:41.860 --> 2:02:44.220
 If you can learn to meet triumph and disaster

2:02:44.220 --> 2:02:48.420
 and greet these two imposters just the same.

2:02:48.420 --> 2:02:49.740
 That's a good line.

2:02:49.740 --> 2:02:50.740
 It's a good line.

2:02:50.740 --> 2:02:53.260
 It's skipping off an amazing turn of line.

2:02:53.260 --> 2:02:56.100
 But I do think that it's a very sensible thing

2:02:56.100 --> 2:03:00.660
 to try to greet triumph and disaster

2:03:00.660 --> 2:03:03.860
 and regard them as imposters and greet them just the same.

2:03:03.860 --> 2:03:07.540
 And actually, anyone who knows me knows that I never,

2:03:08.740 --> 2:03:12.700
 partly it's because I have a sort of belief in the old gods

2:03:12.700 --> 2:03:14.260
 and that the moment that I thought

2:03:14.260 --> 2:03:16.380
 that I was at the moment of triumph,

2:03:16.380 --> 2:03:18.140
 the fates would hitch up their skirts

2:03:18.140 --> 2:03:20.780
 and run at me at a million miles an hour.

2:03:20.780 --> 2:03:25.780
 But it's also because, anyone who knows me knows

2:03:26.100 --> 2:03:28.280
 I never have a moment when I say,

2:03:30.820 --> 2:03:32.460
 that's just great.

2:03:32.460 --> 2:03:37.340
 I feel totally fulfilled and victorious.

2:03:37.340 --> 2:03:39.140
 I mean, it happened to me recently

2:03:39.140 --> 2:03:41.580
 when the war in the West went straight to number one

2:03:41.580 --> 2:03:43.340
 in the bestseller list.

2:03:43.340 --> 2:03:46.140
 How long did that last in terms of your self satisfaction?

2:03:46.140 --> 2:03:47.820
 Didn't happen.

2:03:47.820 --> 2:03:49.100
 Not even for a brief moment?

2:03:49.100 --> 2:03:49.940
 No.

2:03:51.540 --> 2:03:54.020
 When I first saw that it was selling,

2:03:54.020 --> 2:03:55.440
 I had that moment of elation.

2:03:55.440 --> 2:03:58.660
 I thought, good, I've done it, it's out.

2:03:59.540 --> 2:04:03.180
 And I did have a moment of elation then, definitely.

2:04:03.180 --> 2:04:05.180
 But it doesn't last, partly because I tell myself

2:04:05.180 --> 2:04:06.140
 it mustn't last.

2:04:07.100 --> 2:04:12.100
 Because as you said, fate hitches up its skirt.

2:04:12.180 --> 2:04:14.180
 Is that skirts?

2:04:14.180 --> 2:04:17.940
 I don't, this, you brits with your poetry,

2:04:17.940 --> 2:04:19.360
 even when it's nauseating.

2:04:20.500 --> 2:04:24.540
 As of 2022, this year, what's your final analysis

2:04:24.540 --> 2:04:27.880
 of the political leadership and the human mind

2:04:27.880 --> 2:04:30.800
 and the human being of Donald Trump?

2:04:32.520 --> 2:04:34.540
 I sort of avoided this for years.

2:04:34.540 --> 2:04:35.980
 Just talking about Trump.

2:04:35.980 --> 2:04:37.660
 Tried to avoid talking about Trump for years.

2:04:37.660 --> 2:04:39.700
 Same reason I tried to avoid writing about Brexit.

2:04:39.700 --> 2:04:41.820
 Do you think that Trump, just sorry on a small tangent,

2:04:41.820 --> 2:04:45.740
 do you think that Trump's story is over

2:04:45.740 --> 2:04:47.700
 or are we just done with volume one?

2:04:47.700 --> 2:04:48.540
 I have no idea.

2:04:48.540 --> 2:04:51.000
 The people I know who know him say that he's running.

2:04:53.020 --> 2:04:58.020
 And I think that in general, Republicans have to,

2:04:59.080 --> 2:05:01.000
 do have a choice in front of them.

2:05:02.740 --> 2:05:06.000
 A one friend put it to me recently, said,

2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:08.420
 you've got to go in with your toughest fighter.

2:05:08.420 --> 2:05:13.420
 And I understand that instinct and I also think

2:05:16.580 --> 2:05:18.580
 it's a very dangerous instinct

2:05:18.580 --> 2:05:20.420
 because what if your toughest fighter

2:05:20.420 --> 2:05:22.160
 is also your biggest liability?

2:05:23.700 --> 2:05:25.460
 What's the best way to get out the Democrat vote

2:05:25.460 --> 2:05:28.060
 in 2024 than to have Donald Trump running?

2:05:28.060 --> 2:05:30.220
 And the people that are doing the war in the West,

2:05:30.220 --> 2:05:32.780
 they're pretty tough fighters.

2:05:32.780 --> 2:05:33.860
 They are.

2:05:33.860 --> 2:05:37.580
 And I'm cautious about this because I know every way

2:05:37.580 --> 2:05:41.100
 I tread it's dangerous, but let me just be frank.

2:05:41.100 --> 2:05:42.500
 Tread gracefully.

2:05:42.500 --> 2:05:44.340
 I'll tread as gracefully as I can.

2:05:44.340 --> 2:05:48.100
 My Wellington boots, my galoshes.

2:05:49.620 --> 2:05:54.620
 Here's the thing, I think everybody knows what Trump is.

2:05:54.640 --> 2:05:56.900
 I think we all knew for years.

2:05:56.900 --> 2:05:59.300
 And I feel sorry for the conservatives who had to pretend

2:05:59.300 --> 2:06:02.780
 that he was something he wasn't.

2:06:02.780 --> 2:06:07.540
 I felt sorry for the ones who had to pretend

2:06:07.540 --> 2:06:09.820
 that for instance he was some devout Christian

2:06:09.820 --> 2:06:13.860
 or a man of faith or a man of great integrity

2:06:13.860 --> 2:06:16.420
 or all of these sorts of things.

2:06:16.420 --> 2:06:18.540
 Because in the public eye for years,

2:06:18.540 --> 2:06:20.900
 it'd be obvious that wasn't the case.

2:06:20.900 --> 2:06:24.760
 But he has something extraordinary.

2:06:26.260 --> 2:06:28.820
 One thing is a method of communication

2:06:28.820 --> 2:06:32.580
 that you've just got to say was unbelievable.

2:06:32.580 --> 2:06:35.240
 In one fundamental way that you can't look away

2:06:35.240 --> 2:06:36.080
 for some reason.

2:06:36.080 --> 2:06:36.980
 Can't look away.

2:06:36.980 --> 2:06:41.980
 I mean, I mean watching him clear everyone out of the way

2:06:42.460 --> 2:06:45.100
 in 2016 was thrilling

2:06:45.100 --> 2:06:47.980
 because those people needed clearing away.

2:06:47.980 --> 2:06:49.540
 You know, I mean, it's just horrifying.

2:06:49.540 --> 2:06:51.780
 What America is going to give us another Bush?

2:06:53.100 --> 2:06:54.780
 What's so great about this family?

2:06:57.060 --> 2:06:58.460
 America is going to give us another Clinton.

2:06:58.460 --> 2:07:01.340
 We're going to get to choose any Clinton on the Bush.

2:07:01.340 --> 2:07:03.460
 Mark Stein said, whatever, we'll just wait for the day

2:07:03.460 --> 2:07:05.060
 the Clintons and the Bushes into marry

2:07:05.060 --> 2:07:07.340
 and then we can really have a monarchy again.

2:07:08.700 --> 2:07:12.160
 So I was very pleased to see him clear them away.

2:07:12.160 --> 2:07:16.980
 I was very pleased to see him sort of raise

2:07:16.980 --> 2:07:18.740
 some of the issues that needed raising.

2:07:18.740 --> 2:07:21.100
 I thought it was a sort of breath of fresh air

2:07:21.100 --> 2:07:23.100
 and I wished it wasn't him doing it.

2:07:24.740 --> 2:07:26.640
 And then there was a question of him governing

2:07:26.640 --> 2:07:27.680
 and it was just perfectly clear

2:07:27.680 --> 2:07:29.140
 he didn't know how to govern.

2:07:30.360 --> 2:07:32.820
 What he did have, however, what he does have

2:07:32.820 --> 2:07:35.140
 is an incredible ability to fight.

2:07:35.140 --> 2:07:37.100
 And some of the forces he was arraigned against

2:07:37.100 --> 2:07:38.280
 were arraigned against him.

2:07:38.280 --> 2:07:41.580
 My gosh, they would have taken down anyone else.

2:07:41.580 --> 2:07:46.580
 I mean, they'd have probably done some similar BS

2:07:46.780 --> 2:07:51.140
 against Ted Cruz if he, you know, or Marco Rubio.

2:07:51.140 --> 2:07:54.420
 You know, they'd have said, some people admitted,

2:07:54.420 --> 2:07:56.320
 they'd have accused all these people of racism

2:07:56.320 --> 2:07:57.780
 and misogyny and everything else as well,

2:07:57.780 --> 2:07:58.820
 just like they did Mitt Romney,

2:07:58.820 --> 2:08:01.220
 just like they did John McCain.

2:08:01.220 --> 2:08:03.540
 But Trump was the one ugly enough

2:08:03.540 --> 2:08:05.340
 and bruisey enough to fight.

2:08:06.540 --> 2:08:11.540
 And also a willingness or a lack of willingness

2:08:12.540 --> 2:08:17.540
 to play sort of the civil game of politics.

2:08:18.020 --> 2:08:23.020
 You know, at a party when politeness gets you in trouble.

2:08:23.780 --> 2:08:25.460
 You show up and everybody's polite

2:08:25.460 --> 2:08:28.220
 and you just out of momentum want to be being polite

2:08:28.220 --> 2:08:30.060
 and all of a sudden you're on an island

2:08:30.060 --> 2:08:33.100
 with Jeffrey Epstein and it gets you

2:08:33.100 --> 2:08:34.460
 into a huge amount of trouble.

2:08:34.460 --> 2:08:37.140
 But so Trump has these sort of extraordinary qualities,

2:08:37.140 --> 2:08:41.060
 but I just, you know, look, he screwed up

2:08:41.060 --> 2:08:43.380
 during his time in office because he didn't achieve

2:08:43.380 --> 2:08:44.940
 as much as he should have done.

2:08:44.940 --> 2:08:46.300
 And you could say that about every president,

2:08:46.300 --> 2:08:47.980
 but I refuse to acknowledge that two years

2:08:47.980 --> 2:08:50.100
 when he had both houses in the beginning,

2:08:50.100 --> 2:08:52.300
 he just didn't know what levers to pull.

2:08:52.300 --> 2:08:54.500
 You know, I mean, he was sitting in the office

2:08:54.500 --> 2:08:58.180
 behind the Oval Office tweeting, watching the news.

2:08:58.180 --> 2:09:00.260
 I'm sorry, that's not a president.

2:09:00.260 --> 2:09:03.900
 And he couldn't fill and didn't fill positions

2:09:03.900 --> 2:09:05.660
 because people knew, I mean,

2:09:05.660 --> 2:09:08.020
 people who were very loyal to him,

2:09:08.020 --> 2:09:10.780
 he would just, you know, he'd get them to do something loyal

2:09:10.780 --> 2:09:12.380
 and then destroy them.

2:09:12.380 --> 2:09:15.740
 And I think, and then we get onto the thing about,

2:09:15.740 --> 2:09:17.380
 and here we get onto the, you know,

2:09:17.380 --> 2:09:19.780
 what of course is very, very fractious terrain,

2:09:19.780 --> 2:09:22.460
 but, you know, I covered the 2020 election

2:09:22.460 --> 2:09:24.420
 and I was traveling all around the states

2:09:24.420 --> 2:09:27.940
 and I went to Trump rally and all sorts of stuff.

2:09:27.940 --> 2:09:31.700
 And I, I mean, I was in DC on election night

2:09:31.700 --> 2:09:35.940
 and it got very ugly at one point

2:09:35.940 --> 2:09:38.660
 in so called Black Lives Matter Plaza.

2:09:38.660 --> 2:09:40.020
 When it looked like Trump might win,

2:09:40.020 --> 2:09:41.980
 when Florida came in and got really,

2:09:41.980 --> 2:09:44.380
 I could feel the air were very, very heated

2:09:44.380 --> 2:09:48.140
 and like some Antifa people started getting into black lock

2:09:48.140 --> 2:09:48.980
 and this sort of stuff.

2:09:48.980 --> 2:09:51.540
 And I thought this town is gonna burn, you know,

2:09:51.540 --> 2:09:52.500
 if Trump wins.

2:09:53.380 --> 2:09:55.500
 And in the aftermath of the vote,

2:09:55.500 --> 2:09:57.260
 I was willing to hang around in Washington for a bit

2:09:57.260 --> 2:09:59.620
 and then I saw what it was gonna drag on.

2:09:59.620 --> 2:10:02.180
 And I saw some of his people and others and people told me

2:10:02.180 --> 2:10:03.700
 they had great evidence of vote rigging

2:10:03.700 --> 2:10:05.220
 and all this sort of thing.

2:10:05.220 --> 2:10:07.380
 And I'm afraid I'm one of those people

2:10:07.380 --> 2:10:11.060
 who doesn't believe that the evidence that they presented

2:10:11.060 --> 2:10:12.580
 is good enough to justify the claim

2:10:12.580 --> 2:10:13.820
 that he won the election.

2:10:14.740 --> 2:10:18.540
 And I, and people say, have you seen 2000 mules

2:10:18.540 --> 2:10:22.220
 and have you seen, look, the evidence isn't there,

2:10:22.220 --> 2:10:24.820
 that the election was won by Donald Trump.

2:10:24.820 --> 2:10:28.860
 And I think that what he did on January the 6th

2:10:28.860 --> 2:10:32.300
 was unbelievably dangerous.

2:10:32.300 --> 2:10:35.900
 And, you know, here it is possible for us to hold two ideas

2:10:35.900 --> 2:10:37.340
 in our head at the same time.

2:10:37.340 --> 2:10:39.340
 January the 6th was not nothing,

2:10:40.340 --> 2:10:42.900
 nor was it an insurrection and attempt to stage a coup.

2:10:44.380 --> 2:10:49.380
 And there's a vanishing number of people in the US.

2:10:49.380 --> 2:10:51.820
 It was Eric Weinstein who said that the,

2:10:51.820 --> 2:10:56.820
 it's like, this is the roof that you have to walk along.

2:10:56.820 --> 2:11:00.580
 And like the sides are very steep

2:11:00.580 --> 2:11:02.900
 if you fall off either side.

2:11:02.900 --> 2:11:06.740
 Is there some sense, given the forces

2:11:06.740 --> 2:11:08.980
 that are waging war in the West,

2:11:08.980 --> 2:11:13.300
 you said this feeling, perhaps because of Antifa

2:11:13.300 --> 2:11:16.220
 or something else, that this town is gonna burn

2:11:16.220 --> 2:11:18.340
 and maybe a continued feeling that this town

2:11:18.340 --> 2:11:22.420
 is going to burn with the January 6th events.

2:11:22.420 --> 2:11:27.420
 Are you worried about the future of the United States

2:11:27.540 --> 2:11:32.540
 in the coming years because of the feeling of escalation?

2:11:33.220 --> 2:11:36.460
 Is that just a war of Twitter?

2:11:36.460 --> 2:11:40.740
 Or is there a real brewing of something?

2:11:40.740 --> 2:11:41.980
 Oh, it's real.

2:11:41.980 --> 2:11:45.060
 And how, well, let me then respond to that.

2:11:45.060 --> 2:11:47.060
 How, what is the hopeful?

2:11:47.060 --> 2:11:52.060
 If you 10 years from now look back at the United States

2:11:54.540 --> 2:11:58.780
 and say we turned it around, what would be the reason?

2:11:58.780 --> 2:12:01.100
 What would be the ways, the mechanisms that we do so?

2:12:01.100 --> 2:12:04.380
 Tell you, since I wrote this book,

2:12:04.380 --> 2:12:05.980
 there are two things in particular

2:12:05.980 --> 2:12:10.180
 that I've been really pleased that a specific type

2:12:10.180 --> 2:12:12.280
 of specialist has approached me on

2:12:12.280 --> 2:12:14.420
 to say that things I've written about

2:12:14.420 --> 2:12:17.220
 actually have more application than I realized.

2:12:17.220 --> 2:12:19.820
 One is the gratitude issue.

2:12:19.820 --> 2:12:21.220
 A number of people have approached me

2:12:21.220 --> 2:12:25.980
 who have gone through AA, Alcoholics Anonymous.

2:12:25.980 --> 2:12:27.740
 They sometimes say, have you ever been to AA?

2:12:27.740 --> 2:12:30.020
 And that's a bit of a personal question.

2:12:34.100 --> 2:12:36.580
 But they say, but the reason they ask it is because they say,

2:12:36.580 --> 2:12:38.620
 well, because if you go to drug rehabilitation

2:12:38.620 --> 2:12:43.620
 or Alcoholics Anonymous, Norm Macdonald said,

2:12:43.620 --> 2:12:45.020
 it doesn't sound very anonymous.

2:12:45.020 --> 2:12:46.380
 You stand up in a room, you say your name

2:12:46.380 --> 2:12:48.820
 and you tell everyone the worst things you've ever done.

2:12:48.820 --> 2:12:50.260
 Sounds the opposite of anonymous.

2:12:50.260 --> 2:12:52.700
 Anyhow, but they say, look,

2:12:52.700 --> 2:12:54.500
 because if you go to these things,

2:12:54.500 --> 2:12:57.620
 apparently you're asked to, as part of your recovery,

2:12:58.580 --> 2:13:00.420
 say what you're grateful for,

2:13:00.420 --> 2:13:02.020
 like list what you're grateful for.

2:13:02.020 --> 2:13:05.140
 I didn't know that by the way, until the book was out.

2:13:05.140 --> 2:13:07.180
 And so that turned out to have more application

2:13:07.180 --> 2:13:08.180
 than I knew.

2:13:08.180 --> 2:13:09.620
 The other thing though, is that I say

2:13:09.620 --> 2:13:11.980
 that it's absolutely crucial in America

2:13:11.980 --> 2:13:14.260
 that we try to find things that we agree on.

2:13:14.260 --> 2:13:16.420
 And a couple of times since the book came out,

2:13:16.420 --> 2:13:19.260
 I've been approached by people who are marriage counselors.

2:13:20.220 --> 2:13:21.740
 But we've also said, have you ever been

2:13:21.740 --> 2:13:22.580
 through marriage counseling?

2:13:22.580 --> 2:13:25.020
 And again, that's a very personal question.

2:13:25.020 --> 2:13:27.660
 Stop asking me personal questions.

2:13:27.660 --> 2:13:30.660
 No, but they said, and I said, well, why?

2:13:30.660 --> 2:13:35.220
 Because this is one of the things that we do

2:13:35.220 --> 2:13:39.860
 in couples therapy, is try to find things you agree on.

2:13:39.860 --> 2:13:44.860
 And I think this is very important in America.

2:13:45.460 --> 2:13:47.860
 And it's made much harder by the fact,

2:13:47.860 --> 2:13:48.700
 and I've said this many times,

2:13:48.700 --> 2:13:50.500
 but forgive me if I'm repeating myself,

2:13:50.500 --> 2:13:53.340
 but it's made much harder by the fact

2:13:53.340 --> 2:13:57.460
 that having different opinions is very last century.

2:13:57.460 --> 2:13:59.100
 Now we all have different facts,

2:13:59.100 --> 2:14:02.220
 or at least the two sides have different facts.

2:14:02.220 --> 2:14:05.140
 One half of the country roughly,

2:14:05.140 --> 2:14:07.940
 or let's say 40%, 30%, whatever you want to put it,

2:14:07.940 --> 2:14:10.180
 with a tired minority in the middle.

2:14:11.300 --> 2:14:13.420
 One segment of the country believes

2:14:13.420 --> 2:14:15.980
 that Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election

2:14:15.980 --> 2:14:17.100
 and that the Russians interfered

2:14:17.100 --> 2:14:19.500
 and got Donald Trump into power.

2:14:19.500 --> 2:14:20.940
 Another half of the country believes

2:14:20.940 --> 2:14:23.060
 that Donald Trump won the 2020 election.

2:14:23.060 --> 2:14:24.620
 If you can't agree on who wins elections,

2:14:24.620 --> 2:14:27.620
 it's very hard to see what you agree on as a country.

2:14:27.620 --> 2:14:29.380
 That's one of the reasons I mind the war

2:14:29.380 --> 2:14:31.380
 on American history and Western history,

2:14:31.380 --> 2:14:33.620
 is one of the things you have to agree on

2:14:33.620 --> 2:14:36.060
 is at least some attitude towards your past.

2:14:36.060 --> 2:14:37.740
 You don't have to agree on everything.

2:14:37.740 --> 2:14:40.460
 But the public square has to have public heroes

2:14:40.460 --> 2:14:43.260
 who are agreed to be heroes to some extent,

2:14:43.260 --> 2:14:44.180
 warts and all.

2:14:45.380 --> 2:14:47.100
 If you don't have that,

2:14:47.100 --> 2:14:48.780
 if actually you think for instance,

2:14:48.780 --> 2:14:50.580
 half the country thinks the founding fathers

2:14:50.580 --> 2:14:52.060
 were pretty good,

2:14:52.060 --> 2:14:54.500
 the other half thinks they were absolutely rotten,

2:14:54.500 --> 2:14:55.780
 racist and so on.

2:14:55.780 --> 2:14:57.500
 If half the country basically thinks

2:14:57.500 --> 2:14:58.900
 it would have been better if Columbus

2:14:58.900 --> 2:15:01.700
 had taken a different turn, never found America,

2:15:01.700 --> 2:15:05.220
 gone back home and said, I don't know, nothing out there,

2:15:05.220 --> 2:15:06.380
 that would have been better.

2:15:06.380 --> 2:15:08.660
 And the other half's pretty glad in the end

2:15:08.660 --> 2:15:10.380
 that we've got America.

2:15:13.900 --> 2:15:16.540
 You've got to agree on something.

2:15:16.540 --> 2:15:18.500
 And I just see in America,

2:15:18.500 --> 2:15:20.500
 I do think we've got to try to find things to agree on,

2:15:20.500 --> 2:15:23.060
 like a reasonable attitude towards the past.

2:15:23.060 --> 2:15:24.700
 That's why that matters.

2:15:24.700 --> 2:15:27.460
 And again, I stress, I'm not trying to say

2:15:27.460 --> 2:15:29.420
 that everything in the American past was good.

2:15:29.420 --> 2:15:31.980
 God knows that wouldn't stand up to a second of scrutiny

2:15:31.980 --> 2:15:33.260
 or self scrutiny.

2:15:33.260 --> 2:15:35.100
 But nor was it all bad.

2:15:35.100 --> 2:15:38.740
 This wasn't a country formed in sin

2:15:38.740 --> 2:15:40.700
 and in an eradicable sin.

2:15:40.700 --> 2:15:42.900
 It wasn't founded in 1619

2:15:42.900 --> 2:15:45.820
 in order to make the country wicked

2:15:45.820 --> 2:15:49.100
 and incapable of escaping that wickedness.

2:15:49.100 --> 2:15:51.460
 These are things that will matter enormously

2:15:51.460 --> 2:15:52.740
 in the years ahead,

2:15:52.740 --> 2:15:55.780
 because if you can't agree on anything,

2:15:55.780 --> 2:15:57.580
 including who your heroes are,

2:15:59.580 --> 2:16:02.020
 the whole thing is just one massive division

2:16:02.020 --> 2:16:04.100
 and we'll see what I think we're already seeing,

2:16:04.100 --> 2:16:06.300
 which is people basically going to states

2:16:06.300 --> 2:16:09.020
 where it's more like the life they want to live.

2:16:09.020 --> 2:16:11.460
 And some people say to me, well, that's okay.

2:16:11.460 --> 2:16:14.860
 And the genius of the founding is that it allows for that.

2:16:16.340 --> 2:16:18.620
 That's possible, but it's also,

2:16:18.620 --> 2:16:22.700
 it eradicates part of what has been American public life,

2:16:22.700 --> 2:16:24.460
 which is the ability to look at each other

2:16:24.460 --> 2:16:26.860
 and discuss face to face.

2:16:26.860 --> 2:16:30.060
 And I see things like this bomb placed under America

2:16:30.060 --> 2:16:31.980
 the other week with the Supreme Court League,

2:16:31.980 --> 2:16:35.660
 the draft league as being just a further example of that.

2:16:37.220 --> 2:16:39.220
 I'm very, very worried about it in America.

2:16:39.220 --> 2:16:43.220
 And because if America screws up everything,

2:16:43.220 --> 2:16:45.700
 everything else in the world goes.

2:16:45.700 --> 2:16:48.020
 Yeah, there's the degree to which America is still

2:16:48.020 --> 2:16:53.020
 the beacon of these ideas on which the country was founded

2:16:53.860 --> 2:16:58.860
 and has been able to live out in better and better forms,

2:16:58.860 --> 2:17:02.580
 sort of live out the actual ideals of the founding principles

2:17:02.580 --> 2:17:03.420
 versus like.

2:17:03.420 --> 2:17:05.380
 And with the desire to improve.

2:17:05.380 --> 2:17:06.220
 Yeah, constantly.

2:17:06.220 --> 2:17:08.300
 An imperfect union.

2:17:08.300 --> 2:17:12.180
 Yeah, well, as I generally have hope that people want

2:17:12.180 --> 2:17:14.780
 to sort of, in terms of gratitude,

2:17:14.780 --> 2:17:19.220
 people are aware of how good it feels to be grateful.

2:17:20.780 --> 2:17:22.460
 It's a better life psychologically.

2:17:22.460 --> 2:17:25.860
 The resentment is a thing that destroys you from within.

2:17:25.860 --> 2:17:30.540
 So I just feel that people will long for that

2:17:30.540 --> 2:17:31.380
 and will find that.

2:17:31.380 --> 2:17:33.580
 And that's the American way.

2:17:33.580 --> 2:17:36.660
 Some of the division that we reveal now has to do

2:17:36.660 --> 2:17:38.860
 with new technologies like social media.

2:17:38.860 --> 2:17:43.220
 That kind of is a small kind of deviation

2:17:43.220 --> 2:17:45.340
 from the path we're on because it's a new,

2:17:45.340 --> 2:17:47.860
 we've got a new toy, just like nuclear weapons.

2:17:47.860 --> 2:17:49.740
 Yeah, which are relatively new.

2:17:50.900 --> 2:17:53.700
 But we need to find reasonable attitudes

2:17:53.700 --> 2:17:54.540
 towards these things.

2:17:54.540 --> 2:17:58.180
 And that's why I say it matters how you and my feedback

2:17:58.180 --> 2:18:01.340
 on social media, because we're all going through it

2:18:01.340 --> 2:18:02.180
 to some extent.

2:18:02.180 --> 2:18:03.020
 Yeah, we're learning.

2:18:03.020 --> 2:18:03.860
 And we're learning.

2:18:03.860 --> 2:18:08.500
 And we've got to learn how to do this without going mad.

2:18:08.500 --> 2:18:12.380
 I say this, it was my minimalist call to friends

2:18:12.380 --> 2:18:16.820
 in this era was the main job is not to go insane.

2:18:16.820 --> 2:18:17.660
 Yeah.

2:18:17.660 --> 2:18:20.500
 Yeah.

2:18:20.500 --> 2:18:22.780
 And yeah, like walk towards sanity.

2:18:22.780 --> 2:18:26.900
 Because I'm sure there's a Hunter S. Thompson quote

2:18:26.900 --> 2:18:29.140
 in there, like insanity on the weekends

2:18:29.140 --> 2:18:30.460
 can be at least fun.

2:18:30.460 --> 2:18:33.140
 Okay, do you have advice for young people

2:18:35.580 --> 2:18:38.700
 that just put down their TikTok and are listening

2:18:38.700 --> 2:18:41.540
 to this podcast in high school and college

2:18:41.540 --> 2:18:43.940
 about how to have a career, how to have a life

2:18:43.940 --> 2:18:44.980
 they can be proud of?

2:18:47.220 --> 2:18:48.180
 It's a very broad question.

2:18:48.180 --> 2:18:52.100
 But of course, I mean, I can give specific advice

2:18:52.100 --> 2:18:53.380
 to people who want to be writers and so on,

2:18:53.380 --> 2:18:54.820
 but that's a bit niche, maybe.

2:18:56.060 --> 2:18:57.740
 Well, writers will be very interesting,

2:18:57.740 --> 2:18:58.740
 sorry to interrupt.

2:18:58.740 --> 2:19:00.820
 Also how to put your ideas down on paper

2:19:00.820 --> 2:19:03.100
 and think through the ideas, develop them

2:19:03.100 --> 2:19:07.100
 and have the guts to go to a large audience,

2:19:07.100 --> 2:19:09.620
 especially when the ideas are sort of controversial

2:19:09.620 --> 2:19:10.940
 or dangerous or difficult.

2:19:10.940 --> 2:19:13.340
 Well, the main thing to do is to read.

2:19:13.340 --> 2:19:16.460
 When I was a schoolboy, I'd ever have a book in my pocket,

2:19:17.820 --> 2:19:20.380
 the side pocket of my jacket, only side pocket,

2:19:20.380 --> 2:19:21.540
 and would read.

2:19:21.540 --> 2:19:26.540
 And that wasn't just because I was swatish in some way,

2:19:26.900 --> 2:19:30.740
 but because I discovered probably at some point

2:19:30.740 --> 2:19:32.740
 in my early teens, I discovered something.

2:19:32.740 --> 2:19:34.660
 I wrote about this once.

2:19:34.660 --> 2:19:37.860
 I discovered that books were dangerous,

2:19:39.580 --> 2:19:41.580
 which was a thrilling discovery.

2:19:44.500 --> 2:19:46.740
 I discovered that they could contain anything.

2:19:47.860 --> 2:19:50.380
 And also people didn't know what you were reading.

2:19:50.380 --> 2:19:52.660
 I remember I get far too young an age,

2:19:52.660 --> 2:19:55.260
 I read The Doors of Perception of Aldous Huxley,

2:19:56.820 --> 2:20:01.820
 and I didn't make head or tail of it probably,

2:20:01.900 --> 2:20:04.380
 but I knew that it was about something really interesting

2:20:04.380 --> 2:20:05.420
 and dangerous.

2:20:06.660 --> 2:20:10.660
 And I thought constantly when I read poetry

2:20:10.660 --> 2:20:15.100
 or read history, I think I was just constantly thrilled

2:20:16.300 --> 2:20:18.820
 and wanted to know more.

2:20:18.820 --> 2:20:23.820
 And if you wanna become a writer, you have to be a reader.

2:20:26.340 --> 2:20:27.980
 You have to read the best stuff.

2:20:29.660 --> 2:20:33.540
 And obviously people disagree or agree on what that is,

2:20:33.540 --> 2:20:37.460
 and you'll find the people that really impress you.

2:20:37.460 --> 2:20:39.620
 But I know that I just came across certain writers

2:20:39.620 --> 2:20:42.220
 who just knocked me off my feet.

2:20:42.220 --> 2:20:47.220
 And when you find those people, read everything

2:20:50.380 --> 2:20:53.580
 and cling on to them and find other people like that,

2:20:53.580 --> 2:20:56.980
 find other writers like that, people that are connected

2:20:56.980 --> 2:21:01.620
 by history or scholarship or circles or whatever.

2:21:01.620 --> 2:21:03.940
 For you, was it fiction or nonfiction?

2:21:03.940 --> 2:21:06.380
 Is there a particular books that you just remember

2:21:06.380 --> 2:21:07.940
 or just give you pause?

2:21:07.940 --> 2:21:09.340
 Well, I remember that the first book

2:21:09.340 --> 2:21:13.180
 that absolutely threw me was the Lord of the Flies

2:21:13.180 --> 2:21:15.380
 of William Golding, which used to be a signed text

2:21:15.380 --> 2:21:18.460
 and everyone's a bit snotty about because it's so popular.

2:21:19.820 --> 2:21:22.780
 But I was thrown because I think it was the first adult book

2:21:22.780 --> 2:21:26.380
 I read in that I had been used to the world

2:21:26.380 --> 2:21:29.780
 of children's literature of everything ends up fine

2:21:29.780 --> 2:21:32.580
 in the end, the lost all get found.

2:21:34.180 --> 2:21:37.780
 And this was the first book I read where that's not the case

2:21:37.780 --> 2:21:39.580
 the world turns out differently.

2:21:39.580 --> 2:21:42.500
 And I remember for days afterwards,

2:21:42.500 --> 2:21:44.700
 I was just in a state of shock.

2:21:46.020 --> 2:21:51.020
 I couldn't believe what I'd just discovered

2:21:51.380 --> 2:21:54.100
 and partly because I sort of intuited it must be true.

2:21:55.380 --> 2:21:57.340
 And of course, that is not to say that the Lord of the Flies

2:21:57.340 --> 2:22:01.020
 lots of scholarship on what children do in this situation

2:22:01.020 --> 2:22:04.540
 of being on the island when they do congregate and anyhow.

2:22:04.540 --> 2:22:07.020
 But yes, that was a sort of introduction to the adult world

2:22:07.020 --> 2:22:11.580
 and it was shocking and thrilling and I wanted more of it.

2:22:14.540 --> 2:22:15.580
 It was dangerous.

2:22:15.580 --> 2:22:16.420
 And it was dangerous.

2:22:16.420 --> 2:22:19.540
 And then of course, when I became interested in sex,

2:22:19.540 --> 2:22:21.340
 let alone when I realized I was gay,

2:22:21.340 --> 2:22:23.700
 I realized books were a very, very good way to learn

2:22:23.700 --> 2:22:25.660
 about what I was.

2:22:25.660 --> 2:22:28.540
 And that was even more dangerous in a way.

2:22:28.540 --> 2:22:31.900
 And I thought, I mean, nobody knows what I know.

2:22:33.340 --> 2:22:36.420
 You discovered sex, that was an invention in books?

2:22:36.420 --> 2:22:37.260
 What do you mean?

2:22:37.260 --> 2:22:39.420
 No, what I mean is, nobody, no, no, no, no.

2:22:39.420 --> 2:22:41.660
 What I mean is that one of the things that gay people have

2:22:41.660 --> 2:22:43.540
 when they're growing up is that

2:22:43.540 --> 2:22:45.380
 you have this terribly big secret

2:22:45.380 --> 2:22:47.100
 and you don't think the world will ever know,

2:22:47.100 --> 2:22:49.460
 you hope the world will never know.

2:22:49.460 --> 2:22:54.020
 And it's been called by one psychologist,

2:22:54.020 --> 2:22:56.180
 the little boy with a big secret.

2:22:56.180 --> 2:22:59.900
 And so if you discover that other people

2:22:59.900 --> 2:23:01.900
 have the same secret, there's a sort of,

2:23:03.220 --> 2:23:04.460
 thank God for that.

2:23:04.460 --> 2:23:07.420
 But I mean, that's just a version

2:23:07.420 --> 2:23:09.380
 of what everybody gets in reading in a way,

2:23:09.380 --> 2:23:11.020
 which is the thrill of discovery

2:23:11.020 --> 2:23:14.180
 that somebody else thought something you thought

2:23:14.180 --> 2:23:15.340
 only you'd thought.

2:23:15.340 --> 2:23:18.820
 I mean, one of the greatest thrills in all of literature

2:23:18.820 --> 2:23:21.420
 is when a voice comes from across the centuries

2:23:21.420 --> 2:23:24.700
 and seems to leave a handprint, you know.

2:23:24.700 --> 2:23:26.740
 And makes you feel a little bit less alone

2:23:26.740 --> 2:23:28.500
 because somebody else feels,

2:23:28.500 --> 2:23:31.020
 sees the world the same way, is the same way.

2:23:31.020 --> 2:23:34.380
 That's what C.S. Lewis is said to have said,

2:23:34.380 --> 2:23:36.340
 we read to know we're not alone.

2:23:37.740 --> 2:23:39.300
 But we don't only read to know we're not alone,

2:23:39.300 --> 2:23:41.380
 we read to become other people.

2:23:42.740 --> 2:23:44.300
 I mean, I think I saw in books

2:23:44.300 --> 2:23:45.980
 a version of the life I wanted to live

2:23:45.980 --> 2:23:48.180
 and then I decided to live it.

2:23:48.180 --> 2:23:50.220
 And I'm fortunate enough to have done so.

2:23:52.780 --> 2:23:54.580
 I wanted to live in the world of ideas

2:23:54.580 --> 2:23:56.820
 and books and debate.

2:23:58.340 --> 2:24:01.620
 I wanted to live in the debates of my time, you know.

2:24:01.620 --> 2:24:04.460
 And I remember when, like a lot of people,

2:24:04.460 --> 2:24:06.420
 I read Auden when I was young.

2:24:06.420 --> 2:24:09.740
 And, you know, certain lines obviously stuck with me.

2:24:09.740 --> 2:24:12.980
 But that poem of his which everybody, you know,

2:24:12.980 --> 2:24:17.780
 knows and which he hated, September the 1st, 1939,

2:24:17.780 --> 2:24:21.220
 I remember certain lines in that just like whacked me.

2:24:22.340 --> 2:24:24.060
 What's that one, you know, sitting on a dive

2:24:24.060 --> 2:24:26.540
 and for a second or three, degraded and alone,

2:24:28.660 --> 2:24:31.340
 at the end of a low, dishonest decade.

2:24:31.340 --> 2:24:32.700
 Of course, there's a problem with that line,

2:24:32.700 --> 2:24:34.220
 which is you kind of want to be living

2:24:34.220 --> 2:24:36.540
 at the end of a low, dishonest decade as well.

2:24:36.540 --> 2:24:38.620
 It sounds sort of cool in a way.

2:24:38.620 --> 2:24:41.260
 You know, you're the only person who sees it.

2:24:41.260 --> 2:24:43.500
 But, so yeah, anyhow, that's the diversion.

2:24:43.500 --> 2:24:45.340
 But the point is, if you want to be a writer,

2:24:45.340 --> 2:24:46.620
 you've got to be a reader.

2:24:47.540 --> 2:24:48.460
 And apart from anything else,

2:24:48.460 --> 2:24:50.900
 you discover the lilt of language

2:24:50.900 --> 2:24:53.380
 and the things you can do.

2:24:53.380 --> 2:24:56.220
 And I've read people who, and I still do,

2:24:56.220 --> 2:25:00.100
 I think, my God, I didn't know, how did you do that?

2:25:00.100 --> 2:25:03.060
 In fact, books for me now, and articles and other things,

2:25:03.060 --> 2:25:04.180
 fall into two categories.

2:25:04.180 --> 2:25:05.780
 One is, I know how you did that.

2:25:07.060 --> 2:25:10.260
 And the other is, I don't know how you did that.

2:25:10.260 --> 2:25:13.260
 And the best feeling as a writer

2:25:13.260 --> 2:25:15.520
 is when you do the second one.

2:25:16.700 --> 2:25:19.460
 And it happens occasionally in my writing life.

2:25:19.460 --> 2:25:21.540
 Will you almost like return to something you've written

2:25:21.540 --> 2:25:22.540
 or like right after you write it?

2:25:22.540 --> 2:25:23.940
 No, the moment you write it.

2:25:23.940 --> 2:25:25.580
 You wonder, how did I do that?

2:25:25.580 --> 2:25:26.660
 Yes.

2:25:26.660 --> 2:25:29.380
 That's the most, I've never said that before.

2:25:29.380 --> 2:25:31.580
 That's the happiest thing in writing.

2:25:32.500 --> 2:25:33.860
 Very occasionally, it sounds,

2:25:33.860 --> 2:25:37.540
 but I've occasionally finished something.

2:25:37.540 --> 2:25:38.900
 Funny enough, it happened some years ago

2:25:38.900 --> 2:25:41.460
 in a long piece I wrote about the artist, Basquiat.

2:25:44.540 --> 2:25:46.980
 I finished the piece and I gasped.

2:25:47.940 --> 2:25:50.940
 I didn't know, because that's also a thing with writing,

2:25:50.940 --> 2:25:55.380
 is you, it's not, sometimes people say you need to write

2:25:55.380 --> 2:25:56.300
 in order to know what you think.

2:25:56.300 --> 2:25:58.180
 That's not quite true.

2:25:58.180 --> 2:26:00.500
 Sometimes that's a very bad piece of advice

2:26:00.500 --> 2:26:03.420
 for some writers who don't know what they think

2:26:03.420 --> 2:26:04.740
 and it's not gonna become clearer

2:26:04.740 --> 2:26:06.040
 if they just start typing.

2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:12.780
 But sometimes it is true that you,

2:26:12.780 --> 2:26:15.660
 there's a thought that's just waiting there

2:26:15.660 --> 2:26:17.660
 and a clarity that comes across

2:26:17.660 --> 2:26:20.660
 and suddenly the sentence emerges in your brain.

2:26:20.660 --> 2:26:24.480
 And by the time you typed it, you just go, yes.

2:26:25.540 --> 2:26:27.220
 That's the greatest feeling as a writer.

2:26:27.220 --> 2:26:29.780
 Almost like it came from somewhere else.

2:26:29.780 --> 2:26:34.780
 That's what Bakunin says about what's the moment.

2:26:34.900 --> 2:26:36.540
 It's Tom Stoppard's favorite quote

2:26:36.540 --> 2:26:38.780
 about Bakunin saying what happens in the moment

2:26:38.780 --> 2:26:42.100
 where the writer's pen, when he pauses,

2:26:42.100 --> 2:26:43.700
 where does he go in that moment?

2:26:45.220 --> 2:26:46.620
 Yeah.

2:26:46.620 --> 2:26:47.780
 That's so interesting.

2:26:49.860 --> 2:26:52.400
 Because I think the answer to that question

2:26:52.400 --> 2:26:54.460
 will help us explain consciousness

2:26:54.460 --> 2:26:58.180
 and all those other weird things about the human mind.

2:26:58.180 --> 2:26:59.660
 So that was advice for writers.

2:26:59.660 --> 2:27:02.880
 I didn't really give any advice for people in general.

2:27:02.880 --> 2:27:05.240
 Is that, oh, you wanna give health advice?

2:27:05.240 --> 2:27:06.080
 No.

2:27:06.080 --> 2:27:07.540
 To your channel, Churchill?

2:27:07.540 --> 2:27:09.140
 No, I don't wanna give health advice.

2:27:09.140 --> 2:27:10.260
 Clearly.

2:27:10.260 --> 2:27:12.100
 Because you implied that Churchill

2:27:12.100 --> 2:27:15.240
 was one of your early guides in that aspect.

2:27:15.240 --> 2:27:17.780
 So when you discovered your sexuality,

2:27:17.780 --> 2:27:19.280
 let me ask about love.

2:27:19.280 --> 2:27:24.280
 Far too personal of a question to ask a Brit.

2:27:25.320 --> 2:27:28.160
 But what was that like?

2:27:28.160 --> 2:27:31.720
 And broadly speaking, what's the role of love

2:27:31.720 --> 2:27:33.080
 in the human condition?

2:27:35.100 --> 2:27:37.040
 Sex and love.

2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:40.880
 And for you personally, discovering that you were

2:27:40.880 --> 2:27:43.780
 and maybe telling the world that you were gay.

2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:48.040
 I'm very perilously personal.

2:27:48.040 --> 2:27:49.400
 I do actually have a sort of rule

2:27:49.400 --> 2:27:51.400
 that I don't talk about in my personal life.

2:27:51.400 --> 2:27:52.720
 Rules are meant to be broken.

2:27:52.720 --> 2:27:54.560
 Okay, well I'll break it a little bit.

2:27:57.200 --> 2:27:58.800
 One of the ways in which growing up

2:27:58.800 --> 2:28:00.400
 and realizing you're gay differs from growing up

2:28:00.400 --> 2:28:05.240
 and being straight is that it's almost inevitable

2:28:05.240 --> 2:28:08.100
 that your first passions will be unrequited.

2:28:10.560 --> 2:28:13.520
 Oh wow, I never thought about that, yeah.

2:28:13.520 --> 2:28:17.320
 Now that's not to say, there's plenty of unrequited love

2:28:17.320 --> 2:28:19.160
 among young men for young women,

2:28:19.160 --> 2:28:21.760
 young women for young men, plenty of that.

2:28:21.760 --> 2:28:23.520
 But it's almost inevitable if you're gay

2:28:23.520 --> 2:28:28.520
 that your first passions will be totally unrequited.

2:28:30.040 --> 2:28:33.120
 Because the odds are that the person in question

2:28:33.120 --> 2:28:33.960
 will not be gay.

2:28:33.960 --> 2:28:37.520
 So the experience of love is mostly heartbreak.

2:28:37.520 --> 2:28:40.480
 It's heartbreak and disappointment.

2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:43.240
 Heartbreak can be beautiful too, it's formative.

2:28:43.240 --> 2:28:45.360
 Well again, it comes back to the thing

2:28:45.360 --> 2:28:46.600
 if you're a writer or something,

2:28:46.600 --> 2:28:48.880
 that you can always do something with it.

2:28:48.880 --> 2:28:51.480
 That's why all writers are sort of not to be trusted.

2:28:53.880 --> 2:28:56.120
 I didn't trust you the moment you walked in here.

2:28:56.120 --> 2:29:01.120
 No, I mean, it's a famous problem with writers

2:29:02.920 --> 2:29:05.160
 because you always think, well I could use that.

2:29:06.160 --> 2:29:08.200
 It's a dangerous thing and all writers should be aware.

2:29:08.200 --> 2:29:10.240
 It's almost like a drug, right?

2:29:10.240 --> 2:29:11.680
 No, it's not like a drug.

2:29:11.680 --> 2:29:15.120
 It's the fear that all things,

2:29:15.120 --> 2:29:18.320
 even the greatest suffering could be material.

2:29:19.680 --> 2:29:22.360
 What's the danger in that exactly?

2:29:22.360 --> 2:29:25.200
 That seeing the material in the human experience,

2:29:25.200 --> 2:29:26.960
 you don't experience it fully?

2:29:26.960 --> 2:29:29.800
 You don't experience it fully and you might be using it.

2:29:30.760 --> 2:29:33.320
 I had a friend who wrote a poem about a friend

2:29:33.320 --> 2:29:36.480
 who died in a motorcycle accident in Sydney in the 60s.

2:29:36.480 --> 2:29:38.120
 And he said he knew at the moment

2:29:38.120 --> 2:29:39.240
 he was told about his friend's death.

2:29:39.240 --> 2:29:42.200
 A tiny bit of him thought I could use this for a poem.

2:29:42.200 --> 2:29:43.500
 And he did and the poem was wonderful.

2:29:43.500 --> 2:29:45.680
 But there's always that slight guilt for writers

2:29:45.680 --> 2:29:48.280
 of am I going to use that?

2:29:48.280 --> 2:29:50.000
 Anyhow, that's a diversion.

2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:51.560
 Life is full of guilty pleasures

2:29:51.560 --> 2:29:52.640
 and I think that's one of them.

2:29:52.640 --> 2:29:54.640
 Because if you feel that guilt,

2:29:54.640 --> 2:29:58.000
 really what you're doing is you're capturing that moment

2:29:58.000 --> 2:30:01.400
 and you're going to impact the lives of many, many people

2:30:01.400 --> 2:30:02.760
 by writing about that moment

2:30:02.760 --> 2:30:04.740
 because it's going to stimulate something

2:30:04.740 --> 2:30:06.440
 that resonates with those people

2:30:06.440 --> 2:30:08.100
 because they had similar kinds of memories

2:30:08.100 --> 2:30:10.760
 about a loss and a passion towards somebody

2:30:10.760 --> 2:30:11.840
 that they had to lose.

2:30:11.840 --> 2:30:15.520
 So yes, but there's a good sign, perhaps.

2:30:15.520 --> 2:30:19.760
 More obvious perhaps problem is reporting from war zones

2:30:19.760 --> 2:30:23.840
 or bad places and wanting to find bad stories

2:30:23.840 --> 2:30:24.920
 because it's useful.

2:30:24.920 --> 2:30:27.060
 And there is a definite guilt you get

2:30:27.060 --> 2:30:28.200
 from that sort of thing.

2:30:28.200 --> 2:30:30.960
 Like the worse the situation, the more useful.

2:30:30.960 --> 2:30:35.040
 Anyhow, no, so that's sort of the only difference

2:30:35.040 --> 2:30:36.480
 that happens from growing up being gay.

2:30:36.480 --> 2:30:39.780
 And it means that most, certainly in my generation,

2:30:39.780 --> 2:30:44.780
 most gay men came to sexual or romantic maturity later.

2:30:46.120 --> 2:30:49.160
 And there's lots of explanations of that

2:30:49.160 --> 2:30:52.640
 maybe being one of the reasons for perceived

2:30:52.640 --> 2:30:55.220
 or otherwise promiscuity among gay men,

2:30:55.220 --> 2:30:57.040
 which is, I think, more easily persuaded

2:30:57.040 --> 2:31:00.280
 by the fact that gay men behave like men would

2:31:00.280 --> 2:31:01.440
 if women were men.

2:31:04.240 --> 2:31:06.040
 That's one explanation,

2:31:06.040 --> 2:31:08.560
 but it's both a feature and a bug

2:31:08.560 --> 2:31:12.760
 that you come to sexual flourishing later in life.

2:31:12.760 --> 2:31:16.760
 That could be seen as a, in the trajectory of human life,

2:31:16.760 --> 2:31:18.980
 that could be a positive or a negative.

2:31:18.980 --> 2:31:21.940
 But what's, broadly speaking, is the role of love

2:31:21.940 --> 2:31:24.300
 in the human condition, Douglas?

2:31:25.800 --> 2:31:28.800
 Well, it's the nearest thing we have to finding the point.

2:31:30.040 --> 2:31:31.120
 What is the point?

2:31:31.120 --> 2:31:32.360
 What's the meaning of life?

2:31:32.360 --> 2:31:33.400
 Let's go there.

2:31:33.400 --> 2:31:36.040
 So what's the meaning is a hard one, of course.

2:31:36.040 --> 2:31:38.620
 Where is the meaning is slightly easier.

2:31:40.620 --> 2:31:43.720
 And I'd say that everyone can find that.

2:31:43.720 --> 2:31:46.160
 You gravitate towards the places you find meaning.

2:31:47.040 --> 2:31:48.520
 Now, there's a conservative answer to this,

2:31:48.520 --> 2:31:49.520
 which is quite useful,

2:31:49.520 --> 2:31:51.580
 and it's certainly more useful than any others,

2:31:51.580 --> 2:31:53.520
 because the conservative answer is find meaning

2:31:53.520 --> 2:31:55.160
 where people have found it before,

2:31:56.280 --> 2:31:58.160
 which is a very, very good answer.

2:31:59.160 --> 2:32:02.720
 If your ancestors have found meaning in a place of worship

2:32:02.720 --> 2:32:07.720
 or a particular canon of work, go there,

2:32:08.640 --> 2:32:11.680
 because it's been proven by time

2:32:11.680 --> 2:32:13.920
 to be able to give you the goods.

2:32:16.200 --> 2:32:18.000
 Much more sensible than saying,

2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:20.400
 hey, I don't know, discover new ways of meaning.

2:32:24.520 --> 2:32:26.340
 But love is,

2:32:26.340 --> 2:32:31.340
 love is probably the nearest thing we can have

2:32:33.460 --> 2:32:36.860
 to the divine on Earth.

2:32:36.860 --> 2:32:40.300
 And of course, the problem of what exactly,

2:32:40.300 --> 2:32:43.740
 what type of love we mean is an issue.

2:32:43.740 --> 2:32:44.740
 Well, that goes to the fact

2:32:44.740 --> 2:32:47.900
 that you don't like definitions anyway.

2:32:47.900 --> 2:32:48.780
 I do like definitions.

2:32:48.780 --> 2:32:51.220
 I just think they need to be pinned down.

2:32:51.220 --> 2:32:55.020
 But let's not go there at the moment,

2:32:55.020 --> 2:32:57.620
 because it's, yeah.

2:32:57.620 --> 2:32:59.340
 That's not pinned down love at the moment.

2:32:59.340 --> 2:33:01.620
 Well, no, because as you know,

2:33:01.620 --> 2:33:03.380
 I mean, because of the different varieties of love

2:33:03.380 --> 2:33:05.180
 and the fact that we have one word for it in our culture

2:33:05.180 --> 2:33:06.780
 and that it means an awful lot of things

2:33:06.780 --> 2:33:09.240
 and we don't delineate it well.

2:33:09.240 --> 2:33:12.940
 But let's say human love

2:33:12.940 --> 2:33:17.940
 with the greatest fulfillment in sexual,

2:33:18.020 --> 2:33:21.340
 fulfillment in sexual love with another person

2:33:21.340 --> 2:33:26.340
 is probably the greatest intimation you can have

2:33:26.340 --> 2:33:31.340
 of what might otherwise only be superseded by divine love.

2:33:35.020 --> 2:33:40.020
 And it's the sense that all young lovers have,

2:33:40.420 --> 2:33:44.180
 which is that they've just walked through the low door

2:33:44.180 --> 2:33:47.280
 in the garden and found themselves in bliss.

2:33:47.280 --> 2:33:48.620
 And that this is,

2:33:48.620 --> 2:33:53.620
 there's a beautiful, beautiful poem of,

2:33:55.020 --> 2:33:56.140
 can I read it to you?

2:33:56.140 --> 2:33:57.820
 Yes, please.

2:33:57.820 --> 2:33:58.660
 I'll try to find it.

2:33:58.660 --> 2:34:01.980
 There's a beautiful poem of Philip Larkins,

2:34:01.980 --> 2:34:05.020
 which slightly says what I'm,

2:34:06.700 --> 2:34:08.540
 I'm trying not to duck your question

2:34:08.540 --> 2:34:10.900
 by referring to other people, but.

2:34:10.900 --> 2:34:13.240
 Maybe that's the best way to answer the question.

2:34:13.240 --> 2:34:14.080
 Could be.

2:34:14.080 --> 2:34:16.740
 Is to read a poem.

2:34:16.740 --> 2:34:21.740
 So there's a poem by Philip Larkin called High Windows,

2:34:21.860 --> 2:34:26.860
 which is remarkable because he came to sexual,

2:34:30.620 --> 2:34:33.820
 he was straight, he had a rather unhappy sex life,

2:34:33.820 --> 2:34:38.820
 but he came to sexual affection in the 40s and 50s

2:34:38.820 --> 2:34:41.300
 and all the hell that that involved.

2:34:41.300 --> 2:34:46.300
 And he took what I,

2:34:46.300 --> 2:34:49.140
 I regard as being a really remarkable and important view

2:34:49.140 --> 2:34:51.260
 on the sexual revolution in the 60s,

2:34:51.260 --> 2:34:52.700
 which is that most people of his generation,

2:34:52.700 --> 2:34:54.620
 most older people resented the young.

2:34:57.280 --> 2:34:58.820
 They resented the freedom they had,

2:34:58.820 --> 2:35:00.660
 and actually they pretended the freedom was terrible

2:35:00.660 --> 2:35:02.220
 and it was always getting likely to.

2:35:02.220 --> 2:35:03.740
 And Philip Larkin, rather surprisingly,

2:35:03.740 --> 2:35:06.180
 he was a very conservative person, took a different view.

2:35:06.180 --> 2:35:07.620
 And he says it in his poem,

2:35:07.620 --> 2:35:09.980
 and the opening of the poem is he says,

2:35:09.980 --> 2:35:13.700
 when I see a couple of kids and guess he's fucking her

2:35:13.700 --> 2:35:16.980
 and she's taking pills or wearing a diaphragm,

2:35:16.980 --> 2:35:19.160
 I know this is paradise.

2:35:19.160 --> 2:35:22.540
 Everyone old has dreamed of all their lives,

2:35:22.540 --> 2:35:25.180
 bonds and gestures pushed to one side

2:35:25.180 --> 2:35:28.020
 like an outdated combine harvester,

2:35:28.020 --> 2:35:31.780
 and everyone young going down the long slide

2:35:31.780 --> 2:35:34.500
 to happiness endlessly.

2:35:34.500 --> 2:35:38.940
 I wonder if anyone looked at me 40 years back and thought,

2:35:38.940 --> 2:35:41.260
 that'll be the life, no God anymore,

2:35:41.260 --> 2:35:44.180
 or sweating in the dark about hell and that,

2:35:44.180 --> 2:35:46.860
 or having to hide what you think of the priest.

2:35:46.860 --> 2:35:49.980
 He and his lot will all go down the long slide

2:35:49.980 --> 2:35:52.820
 like free bloody birds.

2:35:52.820 --> 2:35:55.860
 And immediately, rather than words,

2:35:55.860 --> 2:35:58.820
 comes the thought of high windows,

2:35:58.820 --> 2:36:01.220
 the some comprehending glass,

2:36:01.220 --> 2:36:03.820
 and beyond it the deep blue air

2:36:03.820 --> 2:36:08.820
 that shows nothing and is nowhere and is endless.

2:36:08.820 --> 2:36:12.780
 The divine, he found it.

2:36:12.780 --> 2:36:16.860
 He found it in seeing a couple of young kids

2:36:16.860 --> 2:36:20.180
 and knowing that one of them was wearing a diaphragm.

2:36:20.180 --> 2:36:21.620
 Do you see what I mean?

2:36:21.620 --> 2:36:22.860
 First of all, it's very counterintuitive,

2:36:22.860 --> 2:36:25.220
 but secondly, this is the point that sex

2:36:25.220 --> 2:36:28.320
 had been so tied up with misery.

2:36:29.380 --> 2:36:30.820
 I mean, people don't remember this now

2:36:30.820 --> 2:36:32.980
 when they talk about the past.

2:36:32.980 --> 2:36:34.460
 I mean, there's one of my favorite books,

2:36:34.460 --> 2:36:36.620
 Stefan Zweig's The World of Yesterday,

2:36:36.620 --> 2:36:39.100
 you know, descriptions of what it was like

2:36:39.100 --> 2:36:42.100
 trying to have sex in pre First World War Vienna.

2:36:42.100 --> 2:36:43.540
 You know, all the men ended up

2:36:43.540 --> 2:36:45.780
 going to female prostitutes.

2:36:45.780 --> 2:36:48.020
 You know, so many of them got syphilis,

2:36:48.020 --> 2:36:49.700
 and this was their first experience of sex.

2:36:49.700 --> 2:36:51.380
 It was so goddamn awful,

2:36:51.380 --> 2:36:53.340
 and they were stuck with it all their lives.

2:36:53.340 --> 2:36:56.860
 And so there's lots of stuff that's gone better

2:36:56.860 --> 2:36:59.460
 in our last century, and that's one of them.

2:36:59.460 --> 2:37:00.320
 But you ask about love.

2:37:00.320 --> 2:37:02.540
 Yes, I do think that love is basically

2:37:02.540 --> 2:37:07.540
 the thing that gives us the best glimpse of the divine.

2:37:08.100 --> 2:37:12.200
 And by the way, sex, liberating sex,

2:37:12.200 --> 2:37:15.520
 doesn't buy you love either.

2:37:15.520 --> 2:37:18.060
 No, I mean, it throws in an entirely,

2:37:19.920 --> 2:37:21.760
 it threw in another set of problems.

2:37:24.140 --> 2:37:27.160
 If there's any meaning on top of all of that

2:37:27.160 --> 2:37:31.220
 is we like to find problems and solve that

2:37:31.220 --> 2:37:35.460
 as a human species, and sometimes we even create problems.

2:37:37.980 --> 2:37:39.700
 Douglas, thank you for highlighting

2:37:39.700 --> 2:37:41.900
 all the problems of human civilization

2:37:41.900 --> 2:37:44.260
 and giving us a glimmer of hope for the future.

2:37:44.260 --> 2:37:46.580
 This is an incredible conversation.

2:37:46.580 --> 2:37:47.500
 Thank you for talking today.

2:37:47.500 --> 2:37:48.900
 It's a huge honor, thank you.

2:37:48.900 --> 2:37:51.460
 It was very kind of you to say that, thank you.

2:37:51.460 --> 2:37:52.860
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:37:52.860 --> 2:37:54.100
 with Douglas Murray.

2:37:54.100 --> 2:37:55.380

 And now, let me leave you with some words

2:37:59.900 --> 2:38:01.620
 from Douglas Murray himself.

2:38:02.500 --> 2:38:05.460
 Disagreement is not oppression.

2:38:05.460 --> 2:38:08.020
 Argument is not assault.

2:38:08.020 --> 2:38:12.140
 Words, even provocative and repugnant ones,

2:38:12.140 --> 2:38:14.060
 are not violence.

2:38:14.060 --> 2:38:19.060
 The answer to speech we do not like is more speech.

2:38:19.060 --> 2:38:30.060
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
