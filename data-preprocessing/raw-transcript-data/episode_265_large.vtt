00:00.120 --> 00:01.840
 I get so passionate about it.

00:01.840 --> 00:04.080
 I get so angry, you know?

00:04.080 --> 00:05.200
 Because there's a saying like,

00:05.200 --> 00:06.560
 oh, can you beat him in a hook?

00:06.560 --> 00:07.720
 Can you beat, man?

00:07.720 --> 00:10.640
 Win, win, that's it.

00:10.640 --> 00:13.460
 Just win and don't talk to me about anything else.

00:13.460 --> 00:16.540
 You believe the match is finished.

00:16.540 --> 00:19.600
 And I wonder if that gets in the head of the other person.

00:19.600 --> 00:20.420
 See this?

00:20.420 --> 00:21.260
 Yeah.

00:23.180 --> 00:24.020
 Quit.

00:26.240 --> 00:29.380
 The following is a conversation with Devon Larratt,

00:29.380 --> 00:32.240
 considered by many to be one of the greatest

00:32.240 --> 00:34.800
 arm wrestlers in history.

00:34.800 --> 00:37.080
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:39.220 --> 00:40.360
 in the description.

00:40.360 --> 00:44.440
 And now, dear friends, here's Devon Larratt.

00:45.560 --> 00:48.060
 You are considered to be one of the greatest

00:48.060 --> 00:49.960
 arm wrestlers in history,

00:49.960 --> 00:52.480
 plus are one of the most charismatic

00:52.480 --> 00:54.880
 and fun people to watch in arm wrestling.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.320
 But let me first start with a ridiculous,

00:57.320 --> 00:59.100
 the controversial opinion.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.840
 I actually really enjoy Over the Top,

01:01.840 --> 01:04.440
 the movie with Sylvester Stallone,

01:04.440 --> 01:06.040
 where he's a trucker.

01:06.040 --> 01:08.480
 It's like a father son movie.

01:08.480 --> 01:10.560
 It's, you know, like a bunch of sports

01:10.560 --> 01:12.240
 have the definitive movie.

01:12.240 --> 01:15.920
 Boxing has Rocky, maybe folk style.

01:15.920 --> 01:18.680
 Collegiate wrestling has Vision Quest.

01:19.960 --> 01:20.800
 What else is there?

01:20.800 --> 01:22.520
 Billiards has Color of Money.

01:22.520 --> 01:26.620
 This is the sort of movie for arm wrestling.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.760
 So what did Over the Top get right?

01:28.760 --> 01:31.600
 What did it get wrong about arm wrestling?

01:31.600 --> 01:34.200
 That was actually based off of a real story.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.600
 A lot of people don't know that.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.920
 Yeah, the Over the Top movie,

01:37.920 --> 01:40.640
 I mean, to a certain degree,

01:40.640 --> 01:41.880
 that's actually real life.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.240
 Like that tournament, Over the Top, was real.

01:44.240 --> 01:45.080
 Yeah.

01:45.080 --> 01:45.900
 It was literally named Over the Top.

01:45.900 --> 01:46.740
 Yes, yes.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.480
 There was a trucker division,

01:48.480 --> 01:50.120
 and the guy actually won a truck for real.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.000
 His name's John Brzenk.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.440
 You know who that is, right?

01:52.440 --> 01:54.080
 So the actual Over the Top tournament,

01:54.080 --> 01:55.720
 the trucker division, was won by John.

01:55.720 --> 01:57.480
 Who is John Brzenk?

01:57.480 --> 02:01.080
 He is, a lot of people talk about him as like a legend

02:01.080 --> 02:03.080
 and one of, if not the greatest,

02:03.080 --> 02:04.680
 arm wrestlers of all time.

02:04.680 --> 02:09.680
 John Brzenk is every arm wrestler's father

02:11.320 --> 02:14.600
 to a certain degree, all of us.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.360
 The entire sport looks up to him.

02:19.880 --> 02:21.640
 It's incredible what he's done.

02:21.640 --> 02:24.840
 I mean, at 18, he won Over the Top.

02:24.840 --> 02:29.480
 At 57, he just competed with me a couple months ago.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.120
 Still at the world level.

02:31.120 --> 02:35.720
 18, that's 40 years of being at the top of the sport.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.080
 It's incredible.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.140
 He's hailed as the greatest of all time

02:39.140 --> 02:41.080
 in the sport of arm wrestling.

02:41.080 --> 02:41.920
 Yeah.

02:41.920 --> 02:44.080
 And he doesn't, he's beaten some monsters.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.280
 Oh yeah, yeah.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.120
 And he doesn't.

02:46.120 --> 02:51.120
 I mean, when you talk about like the evolution of the sport,

02:51.120 --> 02:54.120
 he's responsible for so much of it.

02:54.120 --> 02:57.680
 Like when you talk about, like a lot of times

02:57.680 --> 03:00.840
 when you go back like 20 years, 30 years,

03:00.840 --> 03:03.720
 a lot of us looked at arm wrestling, I think it's,

03:03.720 --> 03:06.920
 I mean, as something you could kind of do.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.320
 And he's the first guy who's like,

03:08.320 --> 03:09.560
 if you want to get better at arm wrestling,

03:09.560 --> 03:10.880
 you got to arm wrestle.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.880
 And it seems so simple, but you know,

03:14.880 --> 03:17.920
 he answered so many questions that all of us had

03:17.920 --> 03:22.920
 about techniques in the sport, back in a pre video internet.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.880
 He's been everybody's target for like 40 years.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.520
 So in terms of strength, there's a power in terms of skill.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.320
 What did he teach the sport of arm wrestling?

03:33.320 --> 03:35.440
 So if you look, how did the sport change

03:35.440 --> 03:38.720
 from 80s, 90s to the aughts?

03:38.720 --> 03:41.040
 You were at the top of the world for many years.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.720
 Many argue you're still at the very top of the world.

03:45.720 --> 03:48.560
 But like you were very dominant, both left and right hand

03:48.560 --> 03:53.560
 in, I don't know, 2008 to 2013, something like that.

03:55.120 --> 03:57.760
 So how did that sport evolve to today?

03:57.760 --> 04:02.760
 So it's hard for me to comment, you know, prior to,

04:03.720 --> 04:06.640
 you know, when I came to the sport was kind of mid nineties.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.240
 Like I've been arm wrestling my whole life,

04:08.240 --> 04:13.240
 but I wasn't really involved in the sport to a major degree

04:13.240 --> 04:16.160
 until probably, you know, mid nineties.

04:16.160 --> 04:20.360
 But I'll say that before the mid nineties,

04:20.360 --> 04:23.280
 it was really hard to get good at arm wrestling.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.520
 Very difficult.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.040
 Everybody was doing it wrong, really.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.600
 Like it was really rare to find people

04:30.600 --> 04:32.680
 who were technically good arm wrestlers.

04:33.680 --> 04:35.320
 It was very underground.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.280
 You know, when I got into sport,

04:37.280 --> 04:39.680
 it was a flyer that came in the mail.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.640
 You had to know somebody who knew you.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.720
 You had to know somebody who knew somebody

04:43.720 --> 04:46.480
 who knew somebody, and then you go to a club

04:46.480 --> 04:49.000
 and you can't do anything with these people.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.360
 And they knew how to arm wrestle.

04:52.360 --> 04:56.080
 They did, but real masters were rare.

04:56.080 --> 05:00.880
 And you know, then internet helped everybody.

05:00.880 --> 05:04.480
 Communication, the transfer of knowledge

05:04.480 --> 05:06.720
 became so much faster.

05:06.720 --> 05:11.000
 People became technically, you know, invested.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.760
 People started to train, sharing ideas.

05:14.760 --> 05:18.240
 By, I'd say, 2000 and,

05:20.560 --> 05:23.080
 well, probably around the turn of the millennia,

05:23.080 --> 05:27.200
 I'd say that professional leagues started to slowly pick up.

05:27.200 --> 05:31.240
 More organized, bigger productions.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.400
 Started to attract more athletes.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.560
 More people took it seriously.

05:35.560 --> 05:39.320
 By 2010, I'd say there was another jump.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.800
 More serious leagues, a little bit more money.

05:43.960 --> 05:47.360
 By 2015, more major media.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.520
 Like, people were investing a lot of money.

05:49.520 --> 05:53.240
 Like, you know, millionaires, billionaires type of people

05:53.240 --> 05:55.600
 were organizing events, setting up leagues.

05:56.480 --> 05:59.360
 And yeah, I mean, the past five years,

05:59.360 --> 06:01.040
 it's just blown up.

06:01.040 --> 06:04.000
 The techniques, I mean, if I was to go back

06:04.000 --> 06:08.400
 to when I started, you know, what took me

06:08.400 --> 06:10.320
 10 or 15 years to learn?

06:10.320 --> 06:11.760
 I mean, new guys are showing up

06:11.760 --> 06:13.600
 and they've got it down in like a year.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.280
 Yeah. Yeah.

06:15.280 --> 06:18.320
 Well, the thing about it, the development of the sport,

06:18.320 --> 06:21.440
 is it's, like I was telling you off mic,

06:21.440 --> 06:26.440
 it's a battle of one versus one.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.360
 And then that can turn into battle of nations,

06:30.360 --> 06:32.240
 which, you know, there is.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.840
 There's Canada, there's the United States,

06:34.840 --> 06:39.840
 there's all the Eastern Europe, Russia, Georgia,

06:39.840 --> 06:40.880
 all of that.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.760
 That's what makes some of the greatest sports

06:43.760 --> 06:46.120
 in Olympics great, like weightlifting.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.920
 It's a battle of nations, not just a battle of individuals.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.800
 And it's almost like these two humans

06:50.800 --> 06:52.600
 represent the two nations.

06:52.600 --> 06:53.960
 And I see that very much,

06:53.960 --> 06:55.440
 we'll talk about your matches coming up,

06:55.440 --> 06:59.720
 but there is that battle between North America

06:59.720 --> 07:01.480
 and that other part of the world.

07:01.480 --> 07:05.120
 Yeah, yeah, North America is very prized.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.200
 You know, the North American champion

07:07.200 --> 07:09.160
 is always highly sought after

07:09.160 --> 07:12.400
 because they're typically the most famous.

07:12.400 --> 07:16.000
 Even still when, you know, quite arguably,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.560
 there's always somebody in Eastern Europe

07:18.560 --> 07:20.880
 who's just monstrous.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.160
 It's typically the North American athlete

07:23.160 --> 07:24.760
 who's more recognized.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.200
 By the way. Oh, yeah.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.360
 We'll have a cup here with some maple syrup.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.600
 Cheers, Lex. Cheers.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.480
 We should probably show,

07:32.920 --> 07:34.560
 you just downed that whole thing.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.320
 No, no, no, I'm gonna sip it.

07:36.320 --> 07:37.760
 I'm gonna sip it, you know?

07:37.760 --> 07:39.380
 But by all means.

07:41.280 --> 07:42.400
 It's really good, right? That is delicious.

07:42.400 --> 07:43.360
 Yeah. Yeah.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.720
 That is. Canadian maple syrup.

07:45.720 --> 07:46.560
 Yeah.

07:46.560 --> 07:51.560
 That's a perfect July day from Canada in a bottle, yeah.

07:52.240 --> 07:56.680
 So you're on a total tangent.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.040
 You are known for appreciating food

07:59.040 --> 07:59.960
 in all kinds of ways,

07:59.960 --> 08:02.920
 but one of the things you're known for is pancakes.

08:02.920 --> 08:06.920
 That is, yeah, that's gone to a crazy place in the sport,

08:06.920 --> 08:08.200
 but yeah, like.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.560
 Where did that originate?

08:09.560 --> 08:12.760
 So, where that originated.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.360
 When it went from like your actual love for pancakes

08:15.360 --> 08:16.200
 to the meme.

08:16.200 --> 08:19.960
 Yeah, so I think what happened was.

08:22.080 --> 08:26.520
 So I had a match with Michael Todd, big match.

08:26.520 --> 08:29.220
 Michael, great champion.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.720
 He's another guy who's, you know,

08:31.720 --> 08:34.000
 he's never gonna get off the horse.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.320
 You know, he's, Jesus.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.820
 His elbow is a complete disaster.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.920
 Probably one of the most loved and hated guys

08:42.920 --> 08:44.260
 in the sport right now.

08:45.160 --> 08:46.680
 Is it because of the King's move?

08:46.680 --> 08:47.880
 Yeah.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.560
 Yeah, the King's move brings him a lot of hate.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.800
 Not from me, not from a lot of people,

08:52.800 --> 08:56.200
 but a lot of observers have a big problem

08:56.200 --> 08:57.540
 with the King's move.

08:57.540 --> 09:00.000
 What's wrong with being a little bit controversial?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
 That's fun.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.360
 You know, I get so passionate about it.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.560
 I get so angry, you know?

09:05.560 --> 09:06.680
 Because there's this saying like,

09:06.680 --> 09:08.080
 oh, can you beat him in a hook?

09:08.080 --> 09:09.240
 Can you beat, man?

09:09.240 --> 09:10.840
 Win, win.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.160
 That's all that matters.

09:12.160 --> 09:15.360
 Just win and don't talk to me about anything else.

09:15.360 --> 09:18.380
 If you can win with style, win with style,

09:18.380 --> 09:21.920
 but don't talk to me about anything but winning.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.200
 That's the priority.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.760
 So you had this match with Michael Todd.

09:24.760 --> 09:25.600
 Yeah.

09:25.600 --> 09:28.360
 So I was in a terrible place.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.460
 I guess it was, I get so screwed up with the years.

09:31.460 --> 09:33.320
 It's 2022 now, right?

09:33.320 --> 09:34.360
 No, it's 2030.

09:34.360 --> 09:35.680
 What are you talking about?

09:35.680 --> 09:36.520
 That's right.

09:36.520 --> 09:38.240
 I think it is actually 2030.

09:38.240 --> 09:39.720
 We're way ahead of schedule.

09:39.720 --> 09:40.560
 Yeah.

09:40.560 --> 09:41.380
 Oh, man.

09:41.380 --> 09:42.220
 That's right.

09:42.220 --> 09:43.060
 So when was this?

09:43.060 --> 09:43.880
 This was like a decade ago or no?

09:43.880 --> 09:47.120
 No, this is like a year and a bit ago.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.200
 Oh, this is very recent.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.580
 Very recent, yeah.

09:49.580 --> 09:52.080
 So I got really sick.

09:52.080 --> 09:52.920
 Is that the match?

09:52.920 --> 09:54.760
 Yeah, this is the match, right?

09:54.760 --> 09:55.740
 Awesome match.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.560
 So this match is for the Legacy Hammer.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.160
 So we invented this thing called the Legacy Hammer

10:02.160 --> 10:05.700
 and Michael took it from me in, I think, 2018.

10:05.700 --> 10:08.360
 And then COVID shut everything down

10:08.360 --> 10:11.600
 and Michael went overseas to try and set up,

10:11.600 --> 10:15.100
 because at that time, Michael was a North American champion.

10:15.100 --> 10:18.640
 He beat me and he went to Dubai

10:18.640 --> 10:21.560
 and he organized this great big match with LeVon.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.040
 And the whole thing fell apart.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.800
 Organizers, leagues, wouldn't let it happen,

10:25.800 --> 10:27.520
 but there was still an ability

10:27.520 --> 10:30.500
 to have a match of significance happen.

10:30.500 --> 10:31.780
 So Michael's like, who do you want?

10:31.780 --> 10:33.620
 And I'm like, let's give Devin a rematch.

10:33.620 --> 10:36.360
 And I'm like, yeah, yes.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.480
 And I was really sick at the time.

10:38.480 --> 10:41.960
 I had DVT, I had pulmonary embolism.

10:41.960 --> 10:45.320
 I was mentally in a terrible place

10:45.320 --> 10:47.000
 and I got offered the match

10:47.000 --> 10:50.300
 and I just totally turned my life around.

10:50.300 --> 10:55.300
 And I committed really hard.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.880
 What happened in this match, by the way?

10:59.880 --> 11:01.760
 Oh, I just totally destroyed him.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.800
 I just beat the piss out of him.

11:08.240 --> 11:11.040
 Michael's a good friend of mine, but.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.320
 Yeah, there's a lot of camaraderie

11:12.320 --> 11:14.500
 when you guys talked afterwards, it's great.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.240
 But we fight like brothers,

11:17.240 --> 11:20.400
 so we let each other really fight hard against each other.

11:20.400 --> 11:23.240
 But so I was, I knew, I mean,

11:23.240 --> 11:26.360
 strength and mass, they go hand in hand.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.800
 And I committed to just getting as big

11:29.800 --> 11:30.800
 and as strong as I could.

11:30.800 --> 11:34.000
 And literally, I was eating pancakes every day.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.200
 Bacon, pancakes, every sloppy bit

11:37.200 --> 11:38.760
 of garbage food I could eat.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.440
 I was trying to eat healthy also,

11:40.440 --> 11:42.000
 but if there was garbage food, I'd eat it.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.340
 What do you mean, bacon and pancakes isn't healthy?

11:44.340 --> 11:45.180
 What are you talking about?

11:45.180 --> 11:46.080
 Exactly.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.680
 But people should go watch, there's a video

11:48.680 --> 11:53.680
 where you make the Canadian meal of bacon

11:54.160 --> 11:57.560
 with some bacon cooking tips, water, that was interesting.

11:57.560 --> 12:01.400
 And then obviously pancakes and maple syrup

12:01.400 --> 12:02.240
 all over the whole thing.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.120
 Yeah, you're making me very hungry.

12:05.120 --> 12:08.400
 I've caused more diabetes than,

12:08.400 --> 12:10.640
 probably gonna get in trouble karmically

12:10.640 --> 12:12.720
 for making the world obese.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.840
 You should probably write a book, The Pancake Diet.

12:15.840 --> 12:18.800
 Yeah, I think I will do that one day.

12:18.800 --> 12:21.720
 So you said mass and strength go hand in hand,

12:21.720 --> 12:24.280
 just at a big level about arm wrestling,

12:24.280 --> 12:26.320
 what's more important?

12:26.320 --> 12:30.560
 Strength, power, endurance, skills, strategy,

12:30.560 --> 12:33.840
 or mental toughness, how do these components

12:33.840 --> 12:36.960
 all come into play in arm wrestling?

12:36.960 --> 12:38.360
 They're all important.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.960
 You can use everything and you can adjust your strategy

12:41.960 --> 12:43.880
 based off of the tools that you have.

12:43.880 --> 12:48.320
 I would say if I could pick ever just one thing

12:48.320 --> 12:53.320
 to have more of, I would say that it would be strength.

12:53.480 --> 12:56.280
 Gained while fighting.

12:56.280 --> 12:59.120
 While actually arm wrestling, so not off the table.

12:59.120 --> 13:02.160
 No, no, no, so you get stronger from arm wrestling.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.920
 How do you get stronger from arm wrestling?

13:03.920 --> 13:06.120
 In jiu jitsu and grappling, you can get good

13:06.120 --> 13:11.040
 by training with people much technically worse than you.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.920
 So with white belts and blue belts,

13:12.920 --> 13:16.680
 it's actually beneficial because you get to work stuff out.

13:16.680 --> 13:21.680
 But I wouldn't say it develops that intensity

13:22.960 --> 13:27.920
 and power required to go against people at your level.

13:27.920 --> 13:30.040
 So how do you balance that?

13:30.040 --> 13:31.400
 Is it okay to go against people

13:31.400 --> 13:33.160
 that are much weaker than you?

13:33.160 --> 13:36.400
 Or do you really have to go against people

13:36.400 --> 13:38.000
 at the same level?

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
 I think that a blended strategy is probably the best.

13:44.640 --> 13:48.480
 I'd say kind of a rule is whatever you do,

13:48.480 --> 13:49.840
 you get better at, right?

13:49.840 --> 13:54.160
 So you wanna be kind of as precise as possible.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.360
 You don't wanna get hurt.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.640
 And it's just about investment.

13:58.640 --> 14:02.200
 And the answer's not always the same.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.240
 Things are gonna change.

14:04.240 --> 14:08.480
 I am currently a big believer in what I call

14:08.480 --> 14:09.960
 tower building, right?

14:09.960 --> 14:14.960
 So you have to do a lot of volume to build a great tower.

14:15.720 --> 14:19.760
 You need to have a ton, a ton of volume.

14:19.760 --> 14:23.200
 So when you look at how to best build volume,

14:23.200 --> 14:27.480
 you want to do workouts that aren't particularly challenging

14:27.480 --> 14:30.720
 to make you feel good and do them so that

14:30.720 --> 14:35.120
 when you add them all together, you get the biggest number.

14:35.120 --> 14:40.120
 So many easy workouts a day that are specific as possible,

14:41.320 --> 14:45.440
 in my opinion, is the best way to lay the foundation

14:45.440 --> 14:47.040
 for an extreme peak.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.920
 And precision, right?

14:49.920 --> 14:53.640
 Like there's no more precise way to get strong

14:53.640 --> 14:55.400
 at arm wrestling than arm wrestle.

14:57.440 --> 15:00.560
 So how often can you arm wrestle?

15:00.560 --> 15:02.520
 What's your training regimen?

15:02.520 --> 15:07.520
 You've talked about this as the climb.

15:07.760 --> 15:12.760
 What is the training process to get great at arm wrestling?

15:12.880 --> 15:16.320
 Well, again, it's gonna depend on what level you're at.

15:17.680 --> 15:21.600
 The answer at the beginning might not be the same.

15:21.600 --> 15:25.120
 For me, a guy who's been doing it almost 30 years,

15:26.160 --> 15:27.520
 I have to harvest.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.720
 I have to harvest energy from clubs.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.440
 I call it cosmic punch.

15:32.440 --> 15:33.280
 Sorry to interrupt.

15:33.280 --> 15:34.400
 You were here in Austin, Texas.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.480
 You are in Austin, Texas, but you were at the,

15:37.480 --> 15:38.320
 what was it called?

15:38.320 --> 15:40.000
 The water tank.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.320
 And you had an awesome crowd.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.240
 It was great.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.080
 I get to watch.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.120
 I got to interact with a lot of those guys.

15:46.720 --> 15:49.200
 Yes, just amazing community, amazing human beings.

15:49.200 --> 15:53.000
 I got to talk to Dmitry in Russian and in English.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.240
 He's an engineer.

15:55.240 --> 15:56.160
 His wife is an engineer.

15:56.160 --> 15:59.800
 He's a brilliant dude, but also one of the toughest,

15:59.800 --> 16:01.560
 I guess, guys you faced there.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.760
 But you faced, I don't know how many people.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.640
 It must've been hundreds of matches.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.320
 So the bar was full.

16:07.320 --> 16:10.200
 Yeah, and that for me is a perfect training scenario.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.040
 Yeah.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.680
 So if I go in and just kind of be,

16:13.680 --> 16:15.400
 I'm like a lightning rod,

16:15.400 --> 16:20.400
 and I just absorb everything that I can get from people,

16:20.480 --> 16:24.520
 all their effort, that's perfect.

16:24.520 --> 16:25.360
 That's perfect.

16:25.360 --> 16:28.640
 I'm lucky because I'm in a place that I can handle it.

16:29.720 --> 16:34.720
 If I was losing or failing, this would not be optimal.

16:35.040 --> 16:37.000
 But because I'm strong enough,

16:37.000 --> 16:39.480
 I've been doing it long enough that I can kind of absorb it

16:39.480 --> 16:42.600
 without damaging me, this is perfect.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.840
 This is perfect.

16:43.840 --> 16:47.920
 I typically, when I'm training up for a very serious match,

16:47.920 --> 16:51.880
 I'll try and do that three or four times a week.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.360
 And then the days in between,

16:54.360 --> 16:58.560
 I will just do blood flow rehab, blood flow rehab.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.280
 I will never hit a PR, a record.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.040
 I'll never do it anymore.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.300
 I don't do it.

17:04.300 --> 17:05.140
 I used to.

17:05.140 --> 17:06.880
 A lot of things change, and that's why I say

17:06.880 --> 17:08.760
 there's a lot of ways to do it.

17:08.760 --> 17:12.520
 This is currently a system that's working very well for me.

17:12.520 --> 17:16.960
 So when you say PR, you're not aggressively chasing a peak.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.000
 You're just building and building and building.

17:19.000 --> 17:19.840
 Yeah.

17:19.840 --> 17:24.000
 My only peak that I care about is for this cycle,

17:24.000 --> 17:25.380
 the 25th of June.

17:25.380 --> 17:26.940
 That's my only PR.

17:26.940 --> 17:29.560
 Let's talk about the 25th of June.

17:29.560 --> 17:30.760
 Oh, yeah.

17:30.760 --> 17:35.760
 Let's talk about Levan Siginashvili, the Georgian Hulk.

17:39.120 --> 17:42.500
 Question number one, is it possible to beat him?

17:42.500 --> 17:47.500
 He is widely acknowledged as the most powerful person

17:49.720 --> 17:51.640
 in arm wrestling today.

17:51.640 --> 17:52.860
 Is he beatable?

17:52.860 --> 17:54.940
 And if so, how?

17:54.940 --> 17:56.340
 Everybody's beatable.

17:56.340 --> 17:57.280
 Everybody's beatable.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.780
 Levan is incredible.

17:58.780 --> 18:03.780
 He is what this modern peak of arm wrestling represents.

18:07.180 --> 18:08.780
 So for people who are just listening,

18:08.780 --> 18:11.540
 we also have an overlay of a video

18:11.540 --> 18:14.800
 of Levan going against Vitaliy Levin,

18:14.800 --> 18:18.860
 another top three person in the world, perhaps,

18:18.860 --> 18:20.400
 in arm wrestling.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.700
 And Levan's the guy on the right, just big.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.580
 I love it.

18:25.580 --> 18:28.800
 And the aggression, I mean, actually,

18:28.800 --> 18:31.320
 sort of underneath it all, he seems to be a teddy bear,

18:31.320 --> 18:36.320
 but when he turns it on, it's raw power.

18:36.540 --> 18:38.020
 He's the full package.

18:38.020 --> 18:41.000
 Levan is, he represents the pinnacle.

18:42.220 --> 18:44.060
 There's Dennis in the background.

18:44.060 --> 18:46.080
 He's like, I wanna be back in there.

18:47.380 --> 18:49.820
 Levan has a lot of bases covered.

18:49.820 --> 18:54.180
 He's, I mean, he's curling 300 pounds with one arm.

18:54.180 --> 18:58.060
 I mean, the strength that he shows for arm wrestling

19:00.660 --> 19:02.980
 is so far ahead of the field.

19:02.980 --> 19:04.840
 He's very, very strong.

19:07.020 --> 19:10.420
 But it's absolutely possible.

19:10.420 --> 19:11.560
 It's absolutely possible.

19:11.560 --> 19:14.180
 The one thing that I'm confident about,

19:14.180 --> 19:16.120
 well, I'd say there's two things.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.180
 The two things I'm confident about

19:18.180 --> 19:21.180
 is that I have more experience than he does.

19:21.180 --> 19:24.180
 And experience counts for a lot.

19:25.300 --> 19:30.300
 The other thing is my ability to breathe and recover.

19:31.860 --> 19:36.860
 So if ever there's an opportunity for the tide to turn,

19:37.480 --> 19:40.140
 that's, I think, where you'll never get it back.

19:40.140 --> 19:45.140
 So I think if I can somehow find a hole in his game,

19:45.180 --> 19:46.940
 then, yeah.

19:46.940 --> 19:51.380
 So you want to hold off the initial assault of power

19:51.380 --> 19:56.380
 and then worm out and to find the hole.

19:56.420 --> 20:00.420
 And then, how much of that is mental?

20:00.420 --> 20:03.260
 How much of it is just the physical ability to do

20:03.260 --> 20:06.240
 for your muscles to have the endurance to hold off?

20:08.060 --> 20:11.320
 I like to make the sport bigger.

20:11.320 --> 20:15.600
 And a lot of things that most arm wrestlers

20:15.600 --> 20:17.680
 believe the sport is,

20:17.680 --> 20:19.760
 I always try and push those boundaries.

20:20.760 --> 20:25.200
 So there is definitely a mental aspect to it

20:25.200 --> 20:26.440
 when you're faced with something

20:26.440 --> 20:28.040
 that you've never seen before.

20:28.840 --> 20:33.080
 That's when things like experience comes in.

20:33.080 --> 20:35.120
 He can become surprised.

20:35.120 --> 20:39.320
 Where what's a surprise for him is routine for me.

20:39.320 --> 20:43.000
 So my adjustments will be more precise, more accurate.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.720
 Yeah, that's how I get in.

20:46.720 --> 20:47.920
 That's how I get in.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.720
 Yeah, I play a dirty game.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.360
 You know?

20:51.360 --> 20:54.360
 So some of it, how important is confidence

20:54.360 --> 20:57.360
 in the progression of the match?

20:58.800 --> 21:02.200
 Is there ups and downs of confidence?

21:02.200 --> 21:05.320
 Like, holy shit, I actually have a chance to win this.

21:05.320 --> 21:07.400
 Holy shit, I'm winning this, you're done.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.560
 There's some of my favorite moments.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.200
 I don't know if those are fake or not

21:11.200 --> 21:12.800
 in terms of your expressions,

21:12.800 --> 21:14.680
 if it's fake until you make it.

21:14.680 --> 21:17.560
 But whenever you shake your head or whatever,

21:17.560 --> 21:22.560
 you make it apparent that you believe the match is finished.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.920
 And I wonder if that gets in the head of the other person.

21:25.920 --> 21:28.840
 When you start to actually,

21:28.840 --> 21:31.240
 so I'm sure you're doing things,

21:31.240 --> 21:34.600
 like precise, detailed things with your hands

21:34.600 --> 21:37.360
 to also indicate that you believe they're fake.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.400
 They're finished.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.080
 But you're facially just.

21:40.080 --> 21:41.160
 See this? Yeah.

21:43.640 --> 21:44.480
 Quit.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.480
 Oh, that's right, because it's facing the other.

21:49.480 --> 21:51.200
 So that's ultimately what the battle is about.

21:51.200 --> 21:54.000
 It's like, you're done.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.880
 You might as well give up.

21:55.880 --> 21:59.920
 Commitment is so important in anything that you do, right?

21:59.920 --> 22:04.760
 Like, I always kind of try and bring things

22:04.760 --> 22:08.480
 to a level of commitment that's uncommon.

22:08.480 --> 22:11.920
 I think that that's a lot of reasons why I do well,

22:11.920 --> 22:15.760
 is because I just get so committed in the whole process.

22:15.760 --> 22:19.520
 And by the time that I actually show up to fight,

22:19.520 --> 22:22.320
 I sometimes just wish that they would kill me.

22:22.320 --> 22:24.040
 I wish that they would,

22:24.040 --> 22:27.160
 because that's how far I want to go.

22:27.160 --> 22:30.680
 People talk about like, how committed are you to the match?

22:30.680 --> 22:32.440
 If you're committed to the match and you lose,

22:32.440 --> 22:34.760
 you should be hurt.

22:34.760 --> 22:39.320
 I'm often unhappy when I lose a match

22:39.320 --> 22:40.440
 and I don't have an injury.

22:40.440 --> 22:42.120
 I'm like, damn, what the fuck?

22:42.120 --> 22:43.680
 I shoulda.

22:43.680 --> 22:46.200
 I feel like I didn't commit, you know?

22:47.560 --> 22:50.320
 I don't know if you know Dan Gable as the wrestler.

22:50.320 --> 22:51.720
 Oh yeah, he was on.

22:51.720 --> 22:52.880
 He was on the podcast? Yeah.

22:52.880 --> 22:53.720
 Yeah, yeah.

22:55.120 --> 22:56.960
 He talked about his whole career.

22:56.960 --> 23:01.960
 He dreamed of working so hard that he can't get off the mat.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.560
 By himself.

23:03.560 --> 23:08.120
 And he's disappointed ultimately at the end of his career

23:08.120 --> 23:10.120
 because he was always able to get off the mat

23:10.120 --> 23:11.520
 on his own accord.

23:11.520 --> 23:15.160
 So he wants to, yeah, leave it all on the mat

23:15.160 --> 23:16.960
 just from exhaustion.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.320
 So that's what commitment looks like.

23:19.320 --> 23:21.440
 What is this process, what is this climb

23:21.440 --> 23:26.440
 for probably the toughest match of your career?

23:26.480 --> 23:31.480
 I would say the most epic match in arm wrestling history.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.680
 I mean, it's really building up.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.440
 You are, as you said, North America.

23:36.440 --> 23:41.440
 That's, I mean, I think by accounts of many

23:41.760 --> 23:43.720
 you're one of the greatest arm wrestlers ever.

23:43.720 --> 23:47.240
 He is one of the scariest arm wrestlers ever.

23:47.240 --> 23:50.160
 And so this match, by the way, where's it happening?

23:50.160 --> 23:51.880
 It'll be in Dubai. In Dubai.

23:51.880 --> 23:55.440
 June, so what does the climb look like?

23:55.440 --> 24:01.440
 The climb for me, what I have to change in my life always,

24:01.560 --> 24:04.000
 people talk about being a professional.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
 I've always loved the sport.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.440
 I've loved it like crazy, but to me,

24:10.440 --> 24:15.440
 the path is about simplicity and removal of distractions.

24:18.640 --> 24:23.640
 I do better and better the more I get rid of everything,

24:23.640 --> 24:30.320
 nothing else, so that my life is just the goal,

24:30.320 --> 24:32.880
 just the target and everything else is off the table.

24:32.880 --> 24:37.880
 And that's where I need to get to, where there's nothing.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.640
 There's nothing between me and him.

24:39.640 --> 24:42.320
 And every single day you're putting in the volume.

24:42.320 --> 24:44.320
 Every day, all day.

24:44.320 --> 24:45.360
 Now you said you worked out.

24:45.360 --> 24:49.080
 So yesterday you did hundreds of arm wrestling matches.

24:49.080 --> 24:51.280
 And then today you said in the morning you still worked out.

24:51.280 --> 24:52.400
 So what was that workout?

24:52.400 --> 24:56.800
 So you're mixing up stuff where you're doing weights also?

24:56.800 --> 25:00.360
 This morning, I try to really focus

25:00.360 --> 25:03.240
 on what's administratively easy.

25:03.240 --> 25:06.240
 That's a big part of me, everything I do.

25:06.240 --> 25:08.680
 So I just travel with bands.

25:08.680 --> 25:13.080
 Yeah, I got bands with me and it's rehabilitative in nature.

25:13.080 --> 25:17.080
 So I'm really focusing on blood flow,

25:17.080 --> 25:20.440
 feeling good, doing proper movements,

25:20.440 --> 25:23.040
 but yeah, it's just a band workout in the hotel room.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.440
 What does a band workout look like?

25:24.440 --> 25:26.640
 So are you doing the arm wrestling movement?

25:26.640 --> 25:27.680
 Oh, you see that?

25:27.680 --> 25:28.680
 See what you did there?

25:28.680 --> 25:30.560
 What's that?

25:30.560 --> 25:31.520
 Yeah, it's you.

25:31.520 --> 25:32.520
 You want to bring him in.

25:32.520 --> 25:38.160
 Yeah, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up into your center.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.800
 You think what can you control out here?

25:40.800 --> 25:43.200
 No, you bring everything close.

25:43.200 --> 25:43.720
 That's it.

25:43.720 --> 25:44.760
 Don't worry about pinning.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.880
 Pinning happens once it's close to you.

25:46.880 --> 25:50.120
 Pinning is, people always think about pinning.

25:50.120 --> 25:51.420
 Don't think about pinning.

25:51.420 --> 25:53.240
 How much of the body is a part of this, too?

25:53.240 --> 25:55.400
 Like the core, the torso,

25:56.800 --> 25:59.200
 because it feels like there's that almost like

25:59.200 --> 26:01.400
 Mike Tyson punch power, right?

26:01.400 --> 26:02.240
 Yeah.

26:02.240 --> 26:06.320
 Does it come from the hips, too, and the legs?

26:06.320 --> 26:08.840
 It's definitely the whole body.

26:08.840 --> 26:10.300
 It's definitely the whole body.

26:10.300 --> 26:12.720
 Like everything is working.

26:12.720 --> 26:14.740
 You're connected to the table at times,

26:14.740 --> 26:15.580
 as far as your base.

26:15.580 --> 26:17.540
 Sometimes your base is your feet,

26:17.540 --> 26:20.480
 but a lot of times you can base off the table.

26:20.480 --> 26:24.040
 So you can base off your hips, but I'll tell you,

26:24.040 --> 26:27.360
 no arm wrestler cares about doing squats.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.360
 No arm wrestler is doing planks.

26:29.360 --> 26:30.200
 Okay?

26:30.200 --> 26:34.040
 It's all about the forearm and the actions of the hand.

26:34.040 --> 26:36.240
 That's always the limiting factor.

26:36.240 --> 26:38.360
 You look at a guy like Oleg Zakh.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.740
 Okay, do you know this guy?

26:39.740 --> 26:40.580
 Oleg Zakh.

26:40.580 --> 26:41.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.240
 Marvelous.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.440
 He's a total hell boy.

26:43.440 --> 26:47.360
 He's my inspiration to what I call pumpkin training.

26:47.360 --> 26:48.200
 But.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.360
 What's pumpkin training?

26:50.520 --> 26:51.700
 Probably we'll get into that,

26:51.700 --> 26:53.680
 but I only train my right arm.

26:53.680 --> 26:54.680
 That's it.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.080
 Yeah, with homework.

26:56.080 --> 27:00.880
 But back to full body, it is full body.

27:00.880 --> 27:04.000
 My good friend Matt Mask, when he arm wrestled me,

27:04.000 --> 27:09.000
 he actually blew his internal abductor in his leg.

27:09.080 --> 27:11.120
 So yeah, people walk away from tournament.

27:11.120 --> 27:13.480
 Their calves can be sore sometimes.

27:13.480 --> 27:14.760
 You know, it happens.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.880
 But no, oh, there he is right there.

27:16.880 --> 27:17.720
 Yeah.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.920
 Oleg, he is a real life hell boy.

27:20.880 --> 27:23.440
 He's like 170 pounds there.

27:23.440 --> 27:24.280
 Look at his arm.

27:24.280 --> 27:25.520
 Look at his arm.

27:25.520 --> 27:26.660
 Crazy.

27:26.660 --> 27:28.040
 Yeah.

27:28.040 --> 27:29.580
 Yeah, he's totally crazy.

27:29.580 --> 27:30.960
 That's you doing left right there.

27:30.960 --> 27:33.600
 So by the way, Levan, you're going right.

27:33.600 --> 27:34.660
 Yeah.

27:34.660 --> 27:36.160
 Yeah.

27:36.160 --> 27:39.540
 So can you say more about the mental side?

27:39.540 --> 27:42.240
 Are you visualizing what it takes to beat him?

27:42.240 --> 27:44.240
 Are you trying to get in his head?

27:44.240 --> 27:45.840
 All of these things.

27:45.840 --> 27:48.340
 So do you think it's possible to get in his head?

27:50.720 --> 27:52.780
 There's definitely strategies that you can do

27:52.780 --> 27:55.440
 depending on who it is you're facing.

27:55.440 --> 27:58.040
 It's very good to know who it is you're fighting

27:58.040 --> 28:00.620
 and choose the correct strategy mentally.

28:02.360 --> 28:06.480
 But I always follow a process

28:06.480 --> 28:09.120
 when it comes to my mental preparation.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.680
 When I'm far away from an event,

28:11.680 --> 28:15.440
 I just always build up my opponent,

28:15.440 --> 28:18.240
 build them, I build them, I respect them.

28:18.240 --> 28:21.520
 To a point where I almost start to fear them

28:21.520 --> 28:23.520
 and start to believe that they'll beat me.

28:23.520 --> 28:27.160
 And this is a very vital part of my preparation.

28:27.160 --> 28:29.520
 And that's where I am right now with Levan.

28:29.520 --> 28:32.300
 I just build them up into this thing that scares me.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.840
 And it forces me to be responsible,

28:37.040 --> 28:39.800
 because I don't want to lose, I want to win.

28:40.980 --> 28:42.920
 So the greater my opponent,

28:42.920 --> 28:46.060
 the greater I can build their worth in my mind,

28:46.060 --> 28:47.560
 the more motivation it gives me.

28:49.320 --> 28:52.860
 Then there comes a point when it changes.

28:53.720 --> 28:56.860
 And then I start to degrade them.

28:56.860 --> 29:00.020
 And yeah, that's when it normally starts to get fun.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.680
 And normally by the time I face them,

29:05.760 --> 29:07.880
 I just try and completely dominate

29:07.880 --> 29:10.720
 from every interaction from start to finish.

29:10.720 --> 29:13.700
 So, yeah.

29:13.700 --> 29:17.180
 When in the actual moment of the match,

29:17.180 --> 29:19.620
 like in the moments leading up to it,

29:19.620 --> 29:21.060
 what's the feeling?

29:21.060 --> 29:26.060
 Is it fear, is it confidence, anxiety?

29:26.540 --> 29:28.520
 What's going through your mind?

29:29.420 --> 29:33.620
 I love to fight, I love it, I always have.

29:33.620 --> 29:38.620
 There's every day where you have the distractions of life,

29:42.460 --> 29:45.020
 and then there's really living in the moment.

29:45.020 --> 29:46.500
 It's whatever you love to do,

29:46.500 --> 29:48.600
 and that's when you can really be free.

29:49.860 --> 29:51.220
 I'm free when I'm fighting.

29:52.100 --> 29:56.020
 So you put me in a good fight, and I just love it.

29:56.020 --> 29:57.260
 And I don't think about the past,

29:57.260 --> 29:58.380
 I don't think about the future,

29:58.380 --> 30:00.660
 I just think about killing that dude in front of me,

30:00.660 --> 30:02.700
 and I enjoy that.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.780
 And just being intensely in the moment.

30:04.780 --> 30:05.620
 That's it.

30:05.620 --> 30:08.380
 Just right there, just fighting as hard as I can.

30:08.380 --> 30:10.060
 Do you study the opponent?

30:10.060 --> 30:12.420
 Have you, for this particular match,

30:12.420 --> 30:14.700
 do you study videos of LeVon?

30:14.700 --> 30:17.640
 I've seen everything.

30:17.640 --> 30:20.020
 I've read everything.

30:20.020 --> 30:21.980
 I get opinions from other people.

30:22.820 --> 30:25.340
 I watch very closely, yeah.

30:25.340 --> 30:26.860
 What do you make of his evolution?

30:26.860 --> 30:30.540
 So he's grown in size,

30:30.540 --> 30:32.700
 but also you've talked about his

30:34.860 --> 30:36.420
 evolution technically as well.

30:37.380 --> 30:38.780
 Then studying him.

30:40.700 --> 30:43.260
 Since we're in the build your opponent

30:43.260 --> 30:48.260
 to be terrifying stage, what makes him great?

30:49.420 --> 30:50.980
 He's very impressive.

30:50.980 --> 30:54.660
 The greatest thing about him is his strength.

30:54.660 --> 30:58.700
 That's the thing that sets him apart from everyone.

30:58.700 --> 31:01.980
 His strength, specialized strength.

31:01.980 --> 31:03.840
 Exact strength for arm wrestling.

31:05.180 --> 31:06.980
 I believe it's unmatched.

31:06.980 --> 31:11.980
 Can we just linger on that word strength?

31:12.140 --> 31:13.860
 What does strength mean?

31:13.860 --> 31:15.100
 What does it feel like?

31:15.100 --> 31:20.100
 Are we talking about bicep, shoulder?

31:21.700 --> 31:25.220
 Are we talking about whatever controls the wrist?

31:25.220 --> 31:29.300
 Is it the, how does strength manifest?

31:29.300 --> 31:32.740
 When I touch your hand, when we grab arms,

31:32.740 --> 31:36.140
 I feel like fuck, that's strong.

31:36.140 --> 31:36.980
 There's control, right?

31:36.980 --> 31:37.820
 What is that feeling?

31:37.820 --> 31:40.100
 Where does that come from in arm wrestling?

31:40.100 --> 31:41.700
 When you're at the top of the world,

31:41.700 --> 31:42.900
 where does that come from?

31:42.900 --> 31:44.820
 So it's chains.

31:44.820 --> 31:46.580
 There's chains of strength.

31:46.580 --> 31:50.460
 And in arm wrestling, this is like technical strength.

31:50.460 --> 31:53.460
 And we use these technical chains to fight each other.

31:53.460 --> 31:58.420
 The chains that I'll talk about is,

31:58.420 --> 32:00.980
 so you'll talk, remember how we talked about the post,

32:00.980 --> 32:04.980
 this upwards drive, this ability to close this angle?

32:04.980 --> 32:06.020
 This is a chain.

32:07.460 --> 32:09.940
 It can be used, it's a technical attack.

32:09.940 --> 32:12.620
 It's also an attack that can be built with training.

32:12.620 --> 32:15.620
 Just the ability to just drive upwards.

32:15.620 --> 32:17.740
 There's a chain where you cup, right?

32:17.740 --> 32:18.940
 Cup your wrist in.

32:18.940 --> 32:22.000
 Cup your wrist in and the anchor and the chain

32:22.000 --> 32:25.180
 brings you right to your heart, right to your center.

32:25.180 --> 32:27.940
 This chain, and this can be done at any time.

32:27.940 --> 32:29.060
 There's a pronation chain,

32:29.060 --> 32:32.320
 and that's to turn your thumb over, right?

32:32.320 --> 32:34.040
 Turn your thumb over and you attack

32:34.040 --> 32:36.340
 the person's cupping chain.

32:36.340 --> 32:37.820
 And there's a huge number of muscles

32:37.820 --> 32:39.180
 involved in each of those chains.

32:39.180 --> 32:41.220
 And that's why I say it's a chain, right?

32:41.220 --> 32:45.060
 But they're movements, and these movements

32:45.060 --> 32:48.360
 you can develop in the gym or through practice.

32:48.360 --> 32:51.040
 So you don't mean, so it's easy to sort of

32:51.040 --> 32:54.980
 interpret strength to mean how much you curl, essentially.

32:54.980 --> 32:55.820
 Yeah.

32:55.820 --> 32:56.740
 But you mean the chain.

32:56.740 --> 32:57.580
 It's all has to do with the.

32:57.580 --> 32:59.800
 Right, and that's, I mean, people talk is it a bicep?

32:59.800 --> 33:01.860
 I mean, yes, there's bicep for sure involved,

33:01.860 --> 33:05.640
 but I'll always be inaccurate if I try and tell you

33:05.640 --> 33:08.500
 what muscles are the, so I prefer to explain it

33:08.500 --> 33:11.300
 in a movement and then everything that's involved

33:11.300 --> 33:13.740
 to do that movement, right?

33:13.740 --> 33:17.400
 Yeah, and Levan's movements for arm wrestling

33:17.400 --> 33:19.340
 are incredibly impressive.

33:19.340 --> 33:22.340
 What do you attribute to, how much of that is genetics?

33:22.340 --> 33:27.340
 How much of it is some training thing he's doing?

33:28.320 --> 33:32.460
 I think that Levan is very special in terms

33:32.460 --> 33:36.780
 of his genetics, like not everybody can be Levan.

33:36.780 --> 33:37.620
 You know?

33:37.620 --> 33:38.440
 Yeah.

33:38.440 --> 33:39.780
 There's not many Levans out there.

33:41.100 --> 33:44.940
 But what I've encountered in the bias that I always see,

33:44.940 --> 33:48.020
 like when people talk about people like Levan,

33:48.020 --> 33:51.460
 they discount the other side so very quickly.

33:51.460 --> 33:54.500
 And the thing is Levan rarely has to show the other side

33:54.500 --> 33:56.540
 because he's so far ahead.

33:56.540 --> 33:59.300
 You talk about the technical application of the sport,

33:59.300 --> 34:03.460
 he so rarely needs to show it, but he's clearly incredible.

34:03.460 --> 34:07.820
 If you watch his progression, he came up

34:07.820 --> 34:11.100
 having very difficult technical struggles to overcome.

34:11.100 --> 34:13.860
 Georgia is a great country for arm wrestling.

34:13.860 --> 34:15.340
 Like there's this guy, Gennady Kvikvinia,

34:15.340 --> 34:18.980
 who no one would ever say is not technical.

34:18.980 --> 34:23.660
 And you know, it took him years to defeat him

34:23.660 --> 34:26.940
 to a point where now it's not even a discussion.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.220
 Yeah, you talk about the progression,

34:28.220 --> 34:30.340
 they had a lot of battles together over the years.

34:30.340 --> 34:31.180
 Yeah.

34:31.180 --> 34:32.980
 It's fascinating to see the tides turn.

34:32.980 --> 34:34.740
 Oh yeah, and once they've turned,

34:34.740 --> 34:38.900
 it's like completely, completely different level.

34:38.900 --> 34:43.740
 Yeah, I mean, he's got strength, he's got technique.

34:43.740 --> 34:48.660
 Some people will argue that his technique is flawed.

34:48.660 --> 34:51.780
 At times, they've shown matches where

34:51.780 --> 34:54.940
 he hasn't shown the best technique, but he's still won.

34:54.940 --> 34:58.060
 And I think sometimes he just plays with people.

34:58.060 --> 35:01.220
 You know, like there's a famous match that he had with,

35:03.060 --> 35:05.580
 they call him the Bruce Lee of arm wrestling,

35:05.580 --> 35:08.180
 a guy called Angurbaev, Kurtagali Angurbaev.

35:08.180 --> 35:11.660
 He's, they had a match in the top eight, great match.

35:11.660 --> 35:15.580
 Kurtagali is like 220 pound guy from Kazakhstan,

35:17.500 --> 35:19.900
 brilliant technician, but power wise,

35:19.900 --> 35:22.580
 you know, not in the same world.

35:22.580 --> 35:26.820
 And Kurtagali did well, even though he lost six nothing,

35:26.820 --> 35:31.820
 he still did well, but in my opinion, Levan didn't care.

35:31.940 --> 35:34.940
 Levan was like grabbing him low and just like, whatever.

35:34.940 --> 35:38.540
 Like, I will show him things that he's not seen before.

35:38.540 --> 35:39.380
 I will.

35:39.380 --> 35:42.980
 And he hasn't competed often in this rule set,

35:42.980 --> 35:44.660
 which will be a challenge for him.

35:45.540 --> 35:48.020
 But yeah, what can I say?

35:48.020 --> 35:50.460
 Like Levan, he's Everest.

35:50.460 --> 35:51.820
 Yeah. Yeah.

35:51.820 --> 35:54.540
 Yeah, you are seen by basically everybody

35:54.540 --> 35:56.220
 as the big, big underdog.

35:56.220 --> 35:58.820
 But you're also, even in the Eastern,

35:58.820 --> 36:01.480
 even, I mean, I talk to Russians a lot.

36:02.580 --> 36:05.260
 You know that moment in Rocky

36:05.260 --> 36:06.820
 when they start cheering for Rocky?

36:06.820 --> 36:07.980
 Yeah, yeah.

36:07.980 --> 36:11.020
 You're kind of the, they love you, they want you to win.

36:11.020 --> 36:12.660
 And just, you know, it's not even,

36:13.780 --> 36:16.500
 just the battle itself is inspiring.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.780
 And it's like the culmination in your career

36:19.780 --> 36:23.980
 because it's, you know, you're at the top for a long time,

36:23.980 --> 36:26.860
 but it's like, it's almost like it should be over for you,

36:26.860 --> 36:28.140
 but no, you're returning.

36:28.140 --> 36:31.620
 It is like this big moment.

36:31.620 --> 36:32.460
 Yeah.

36:32.460 --> 36:34.060
 The big climb.

36:34.060 --> 36:38.180
 I will be the pointy end of the spear for North America.

36:38.180 --> 36:39.820
 Yeah.

36:39.820 --> 36:40.660
 Ah, beautiful.

36:40.660 --> 36:43.740
 Well, let's, thanks for bringing that match up.

36:43.740 --> 36:48.740
 Let's talk about just the match against Dennis,

36:50.180 --> 36:51.660
 your left hand match.

36:51.660 --> 36:52.500
 Yeah.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.980
 He's also terrifying and seen as one of the strongest,

36:54.980 --> 36:58.180
 probably one of, if not the strongest

36:58.180 --> 36:59.840
 left hand arm wrestler.

36:59.840 --> 37:00.680
 Yeah.

37:01.940 --> 37:03.860
 There's a lot to be said there.

37:03.860 --> 37:06.340
 Maybe you could talk about this match at a high level.

37:06.340 --> 37:08.060
 Why did you take on this match?

37:08.060 --> 37:10.660
 Why did you do the left hand versus the right hand?

37:10.660 --> 37:12.340
 What, can you tell the story?

37:12.340 --> 37:15.060
 Okay, Dennis the Plankoff.

37:15.060 --> 37:17.100
 There's so much about this match.

37:17.100 --> 37:18.260
 I love Dennis.

37:18.260 --> 37:19.340
 Russian guy.

37:19.340 --> 37:20.540
 Yeah, Russian guy.

37:20.540 --> 37:23.300
 Russian, I used to call him Dennis Chernobyl.

37:23.300 --> 37:27.540
 Ah, what a monster.

37:27.540 --> 37:34.540
 He kind of led, I'd say, this new era of arm wrestling,

37:34.620 --> 37:37.660
 where the super heavyweight strength level

37:37.660 --> 37:40.260
 has just gone through the roof.

37:40.260 --> 37:42.220
 I wanted the match for such a long time.

37:42.220 --> 37:44.300
 We tried to get the match.

37:44.300 --> 37:45.460
 We couldn't get it organized.

37:45.460 --> 37:48.660
 This is back in like 2008 to 2012.

37:48.660 --> 37:50.500
 Couldn't get the match, couldn't get the match.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.380
 I've always been more of a one on one puller.

37:52.380 --> 37:55.140
 He was doing the tournament format.

37:55.140 --> 37:57.220
 I was ranked number one in the world,

37:57.220 --> 38:00.580
 and towards the end, it kind of was very undecided.

38:00.580 --> 38:02.260
 I ended up getting surgery.

38:02.260 --> 38:05.180
 I ended up abandoning the super heavyweight division.

38:05.180 --> 38:08.980
 I went down to the 225s for a few years.

38:08.980 --> 38:13.340
 WAL failed, temporarily.

38:13.340 --> 38:15.820
 So the 225 pound division was scrapped.

38:15.820 --> 38:21.060
 And I said, okay, I'm going to go for the big crown once again.

38:21.060 --> 38:26.020
 And I started to go after super heavyweights.

38:26.020 --> 38:31.020
 The 2018 season was right hand.

38:33.620 --> 38:38.060
 I started to enter negotiations to have the match with him.

38:38.060 --> 38:41.020
 We'd been chasing the match for 10 years.

38:41.020 --> 38:42.300
 They wanted to do a left hand.

38:42.300 --> 38:44.340
 I wanted to do a right hand.

38:44.340 --> 38:46.300
 I just wanted to do the match.

38:46.300 --> 38:47.580
 I wanted to do the match with Dennis.

38:47.580 --> 38:48.780
 I wanted to meet Dennis.

38:48.780 --> 38:50.980
 So people should know that you were,

38:50.980 --> 38:53.540
 the right hand has always been your strongest.

38:53.540 --> 38:57.500
 It has been, I mean, I had surgery in 2016.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.220
 I hate to make excuses.

38:59.220 --> 39:01.860
 I hate to do it.

39:01.860 --> 39:05.060
 Dennis was better than me that day, even on my best day.

39:05.060 --> 39:07.820
 If you had gone back my entire career,

39:07.820 --> 39:11.580
 at no single day do I beat Dennis De Plankhoff in 2018.

39:11.580 --> 39:14.300
 I would like to think that I could maybe do it now.

39:14.300 --> 39:16.740
 But at that point, there would have been no version

39:16.740 --> 39:18.980
 that could have beat him.

39:18.980 --> 39:20.420
 Left or right?

39:20.420 --> 39:21.060
 Right hand?

39:21.060 --> 39:25.500
 No, I'm curious about the right, but left hand.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.380
 So is the world.

39:27.380 --> 39:28.580
 Well, it might still happen.

39:28.580 --> 39:29.420
 It might.

39:29.420 --> 39:36.900
 But Dennis completely destroyed me.

39:36.900 --> 39:40.460
 And I learned a lot from it.

39:40.460 --> 39:46.980
 I think before the Dennis match, I think I was, I don't know.

39:46.980 --> 39:49.820
 I don't know exactly what words to use.

39:49.820 --> 39:54.900
 Maybe I felt like my thinking was a little bit elitist.

39:54.900 --> 39:57.060
 And I really learned a lot.

39:57.060 --> 40:03.620
 I was really humbled that day by how far, and how professional,

40:03.620 --> 40:07.860
 and how prepared Dennis was, and how seriously he

40:07.860 --> 40:09.460
 took the sport.

40:09.460 --> 40:14.020
 There's a mental, a slightly terrifying calmness

40:14.020 --> 40:17.860
 to him, which only comes with extreme preparation, I think.

40:17.860 --> 40:18.380
 Yeah.

40:18.380 --> 40:23.260
 His level of dedication was extremely inspiring to me.

40:26.300 --> 40:34.340
 I used to do a job where it was serious enough

40:34.340 --> 40:37.780
 that the price could be death.

40:37.780 --> 40:41.660
 And I arm wrestled throughout that entire period.

40:41.660 --> 40:49.900
 And I always kind of looked at the cost of doing an activity,

40:49.900 --> 40:55.940
 being death, limited to soldiering.

40:55.940 --> 41:00.380
 And I kind of changed my mind a lot after that match.

41:00.380 --> 41:04.620
 I realized that anything that you're in love with,

41:04.620 --> 41:06.660
 once you get far enough down the road,

41:06.660 --> 41:09.980
 and professional enough at it, it's going to kill you.

41:09.980 --> 41:12.380
 Doesn't matter what you're doing, if you're crazy enough

41:12.380 --> 41:15.300
 about anything, it's probably going to take your life

41:15.300 --> 41:18.980
 from you in some way.

41:18.980 --> 41:21.340
 And that doesn't mean you rush towards death.

41:21.340 --> 41:24.140
 It's just your level of investment and level of risk

41:24.140 --> 41:27.580
 can have some catastrophic effects.

41:27.580 --> 41:29.460
 Bukowski, Charles Bukowski, I think

41:29.460 --> 41:32.940
 has the quote, do what you love and let it kill you.

41:32.940 --> 41:33.300
 Right.

41:33.300 --> 41:33.940
 Like that.

41:33.940 --> 41:35.420
 Right.

41:35.420 --> 41:40.660
 And I understood that Dennis's level of professionalism

41:40.660 --> 41:45.700
 far exceeded mine in what we were doing at the time.

41:45.700 --> 41:50.420
 And I realized that I was no longer employed.

41:50.420 --> 41:54.340
 I was now in the world of professional arm wrestling.

41:54.340 --> 41:58.940
 And I realized that what was I doing?

41:58.940 --> 42:00.580
 How serious was I?

42:00.580 --> 42:02.820
 So Dennis is an incredible guy.

42:02.820 --> 42:04.980
 Is there moments in that match, there's

42:04.980 --> 42:07.740
 humility there, too, from him.

42:07.740 --> 42:12.100
 That was a fascinating sort of, it

42:12.100 --> 42:14.540
 seemed like you realized that you just hit a wall

42:14.540 --> 42:16.220
 and you were not ready enough for it.

42:16.220 --> 42:17.860
 It was incredible.

42:17.860 --> 42:20.620
 There was so many things that I remember about the Dennis

42:20.620 --> 42:21.120
 match.

42:21.120 --> 42:25.220
 I mean, I remember seeing videos of somebody

42:25.220 --> 42:28.180
 and then meeting them in person, it's different.

42:28.180 --> 42:30.580
 I remember in the weigh ins, sorry, not the weigh ins,

42:30.580 --> 42:32.940
 the standoff that we did before the match.

42:32.940 --> 42:34.740
 I'm looking at him, I'm close.

42:34.740 --> 42:36.660
 I'm looking at his arms.

42:36.660 --> 42:42.100
 And his bicep, it looked like an ass.

42:42.100 --> 42:44.500
 It was like a freaking glute muscle.

42:44.500 --> 42:51.660
 Like his entire structure was so sinewy and just so strong.

42:51.660 --> 42:55.180
 I was like, wow, he's physically so impressive.

42:55.180 --> 43:01.500
 And I remember when I arm wrestled him at a certain time,

43:01.500 --> 43:04.660
 he allowed me to kind of set my position.

43:04.660 --> 43:09.300
 You can't really tell because it happens very quickly.

43:09.300 --> 43:10.940
 But he let me set my position, which

43:10.940 --> 43:15.340
 means I kind of got my locks in, where you can kind of really

43:15.340 --> 43:18.140
 do a great hold.

43:18.140 --> 43:20.340
 And he just ripped through me.

43:20.340 --> 43:23.940
 So you were able to get this great position.

43:23.940 --> 43:27.700
 So it was tore right through me.

43:27.700 --> 43:30.740
 And the first time I ever thought

43:30.740 --> 43:33.300
 that I had torn something.

43:33.300 --> 43:34.780
 I thought, after the match, I'm like,

43:34.780 --> 43:38.740
 geez, did he rip my chest right in half?

43:38.740 --> 43:40.460
 What, did it?

43:40.460 --> 43:42.140
 No, I think it was 100%.

43:42.140 --> 43:43.940
 Yeah, no, I didn't actually.

43:43.940 --> 43:45.980
 Nothing went purple or anything.

43:45.980 --> 43:52.940
 But yeah, the strength gap was very significant with Dennis.

43:52.940 --> 43:58.060
 Could he, what would it take to beat him on that day?

43:58.060 --> 44:04.860
 It would take me just being a little bit stronger and more

44:04.860 --> 44:06.580
 healthy, yeah.

44:06.580 --> 44:10.260
 My left was not as healthy as it should be.

44:10.260 --> 44:13.820
 I didn't have a full rounded technical arsenal.

44:13.820 --> 44:15.780
 It takes a time after surgery.

44:15.780 --> 44:17.780
 It really does.

44:17.780 --> 44:22.180
 You can be good, but after a surgery, like what I had,

44:22.180 --> 44:24.140
 you're probably looking at three or four years

44:24.140 --> 44:26.780
 before you're starting to hit technical proficiency

44:26.780 --> 44:28.780
 the way you should be.

44:28.780 --> 44:31.260
 And yeah, just a bit stronger.

44:31.260 --> 44:33.700
 How do you interpret the calmness on his face?

44:33.700 --> 44:35.180
 Well, what is that about?

44:35.180 --> 44:37.500
 Is he actually that calm or is he just trained?

44:37.500 --> 44:38.860
 It's a Russian thing, I think.

44:38.860 --> 44:39.340
 I don't know.

44:39.340 --> 44:41.060
 I see a lot of Russians like that.

44:41.060 --> 44:42.700
 They're so stoic.

44:42.700 --> 44:44.780
 And I'm such a fan of Russia.

44:44.780 --> 44:46.220
 I really want to go to Moscow.

44:46.220 --> 44:47.500
 I've been saying it forever.

44:47.500 --> 44:48.220
 You've never been?

44:48.220 --> 44:49.260
 Not yet.

44:49.260 --> 44:50.260
 I want to go.

44:50.260 --> 44:53.460
 I want to just go and live there for a month and just train.

44:53.460 --> 44:56.620
 Moscow has got such a crazy arm wrestling scene.

44:56.620 --> 44:58.700
 From what I understand, they just have so many clubs.

44:58.700 --> 45:00.580
 There's so many strong athletes.

45:00.580 --> 45:03.420
 Just go and just lightning rod.

45:03.420 --> 45:04.020
 Yeah.

45:04.020 --> 45:08.020
 Have you considered doing something of that sort?

45:08.020 --> 45:09.860
 It's like Rocky IV again.

45:09.860 --> 45:11.460
 Oh, yeah.

45:11.460 --> 45:12.980
 And lead up to June.

45:12.980 --> 45:14.580
 I would certainly consider it.

45:14.580 --> 45:19.660
 I've got only one trip planned at the moment.

45:19.660 --> 45:22.900
 Administration is very important.

45:22.900 --> 45:24.300
 What do you mean by administration?

45:24.300 --> 45:25.380
 Like managing your time?

45:25.380 --> 45:26.060
 Management.

45:26.060 --> 45:29.340
 Yeah, the management has to be very efficient.

45:29.340 --> 45:31.900
 When I'm a tourist, when I'm a visitor,

45:31.900 --> 45:33.740
 a little bit of that goes down.

45:33.740 --> 45:37.140
 When I'm at my home and things are familiar,

45:37.140 --> 45:40.420
 I've got a really great grasp on my time.

45:40.420 --> 45:41.860
 Everything's in place.

45:41.860 --> 45:43.900
 Everything's perfect.

45:43.900 --> 45:47.540
 If I could magically transport Moscow into my hometown

45:47.540 --> 45:50.100
 and just go out and visit them, yeah.

45:50.100 --> 45:53.180
 So it's very difficult when you're traveling.

45:53.180 --> 45:55.780
 You have to figure out what you're eating,

45:55.780 --> 45:58.500
 how are you getting the food, all the socializing.

45:58.500 --> 46:00.980
 Plus, you're more and more a celebrity,

46:00.980 --> 46:02.980
 so there's a social interaction, which

46:02.980 --> 46:05.500
 I don't know how draining that could be on you

46:05.500 --> 46:07.580
 outside of the arm wrestling table.

46:07.580 --> 46:09.540
 So you have to manage all of that,

46:09.540 --> 46:13.940
 because ultimately, you have to focus on the fight ahead.

46:13.940 --> 46:14.820
 Yeah.

46:14.820 --> 46:18.340
 Yeah, a lot of my strength comes from just

46:18.340 --> 46:22.300
 being in a familiar place, doing my routine.

46:22.300 --> 46:23.740
 I love to travel.

46:23.740 --> 46:29.100
 I love to get out there and meet people and new experiences.

46:29.100 --> 46:32.340
 But when I just want to really prepare for a big match,

46:32.340 --> 46:35.580
 yeah, home is where I get strong.

46:35.580 --> 46:38.140
 So that loss against Dennis was one

46:38.140 --> 46:40.820
 of the few losses in your career.

46:40.820 --> 46:46.060
 How did that feel in the moments after, in the days after,

46:46.060 --> 46:48.460
 in the months after, in the years after?

46:48.460 --> 46:53.260
 How has it changed you as an arm wrestler as a human being?

46:53.260 --> 46:58.380
 Well, it's tough to lose.

46:58.380 --> 46:59.100
 Still haunt you?

47:01.860 --> 47:02.620
 I don't think so.

47:02.620 --> 47:05.220
 I actually was really happy to lose to Dennis,

47:05.220 --> 47:08.460
 because sometimes when you lose a match,

47:08.460 --> 47:11.900
 there's a lot of matches that I've lost where they upset me,

47:11.900 --> 47:13.940
 because I know I made a mistake.

47:13.940 --> 47:15.360
 I didn't make a mistake with Dennis.

47:15.360 --> 47:17.300
 He was just way better.

47:17.300 --> 47:19.780
 There's nothing I could have done that day.

47:19.780 --> 47:22.820
 I'm really at peace with it.

47:22.820 --> 47:25.300
 Dennis, to me, was just a big inspiration.

47:25.300 --> 47:28.260
 I think that me arm wrestling Dennis left handed that day

47:28.260 --> 47:31.620
 just let me touch probably one of the strongest

47:31.620 --> 47:33.220
 human beings on the arm wrestling table

47:33.220 --> 47:36.820
 that's ever lived, left handed.

47:36.820 --> 47:41.980
 So knowing that's possible is almost like inspiration to you

47:41.980 --> 47:43.420
 that I can be at that level, too.

47:43.420 --> 47:45.340
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:45.340 --> 47:48.460
 Seeing what Dennis did, just trying

47:48.460 --> 47:54.740
 to absorb a little bit of his knowledge planted seeds in me.

47:54.740 --> 47:59.020
 When I look at my career, it's a bit like the stock market.

47:59.020 --> 48:02.080
 But for sure, I'm trending upwards.

48:02.080 --> 48:05.980
 And since really kind of wrapping my mind

48:05.980 --> 48:09.220
 around some of the Russian philosophies,

48:09.220 --> 48:12.180
 they really changed my training systems.

48:12.180 --> 48:14.380
 There were some base philosophies

48:14.380 --> 48:16.540
 that they talked to me about over there

48:16.540 --> 48:19.660
 that massively impacted my training.

48:19.660 --> 48:21.940
 Is it possible to convert some of those philosophies

48:21.940 --> 48:22.620
 into words?

48:22.620 --> 48:25.860
 Can you describe some of the ideas they taught you?

48:25.860 --> 48:27.940
 Never smile.

48:27.940 --> 48:29.340
 Right?

48:29.340 --> 48:32.380
 Man, it takes a while to break the ice

48:32.380 --> 48:34.620
 with a lot of these guys.

48:34.620 --> 48:37.780
 Well, once you do, that's the deepest bonds you can form.

48:37.780 --> 48:39.680
 Yeah, yeah, for sure.

48:39.680 --> 48:46.020
 I think that I was raised under, I believe it's a flawed.

48:46.020 --> 48:50.700
 I mean, it's not flawed, because it has its value as well.

48:50.700 --> 48:54.940
 But it's best if you understand both philosophies.

48:54.940 --> 48:57.500
 I think a North American thing that's

48:57.500 --> 49:05.340
 just so ingrained in our fitness society is no pain, no gain.

49:05.340 --> 49:09.380
 And just pushing, and sweating, and going harder,

49:09.380 --> 49:14.860
 and fighting through, and grit, and tough.

49:14.860 --> 49:16.220
 And then you talk to the Russians,

49:16.220 --> 49:18.220
 and they're like, yeah, never fail.

49:18.220 --> 49:19.380
 You never fail.

49:19.380 --> 49:21.480
 Never go to failure.

49:21.480 --> 49:23.140
 Always feel good.

49:23.140 --> 49:23.940
 Always feel good.

49:23.940 --> 49:26.660
 It should always feel good.

49:26.660 --> 49:29.560
 And those two philosophies express themselves

49:29.560 --> 49:31.980
 very differently.

49:31.980 --> 49:36.340
 And if you want to get strong, yeah, don't fail.

49:36.340 --> 49:37.540
 Don't fail.

49:37.540 --> 49:41.660
 So they also are believers of volume.

49:41.660 --> 49:44.900
 Yeah, there's a lot of strategies,

49:44.900 --> 49:47.380
 but volume is a massive principle.

49:47.380 --> 49:50.580
 And volume is very hard to achieve

49:50.580 --> 49:53.780
 when you're believing in no pain, no gain.

49:53.780 --> 49:55.380
 They don't really go together.

49:55.380 --> 49:58.840
 No pain, no gain, more injuries.

49:58.840 --> 50:00.340
 So is there parallels?

50:00.340 --> 50:03.060
 Because in wrestling, some of the greatest wrestlers

50:03.060 --> 50:04.540
 of all time are Russian.

50:04.540 --> 50:07.460
 And they were big, Dan Gable talks about it,

50:07.460 --> 50:10.060
 they were big on play.

50:10.060 --> 50:12.780
 Like, lighter wrestling is probably,

50:12.780 --> 50:15.500
 ultimately, actually, it boils down to

50:15.500 --> 50:17.900
 that's how you achieve higher volume.

50:17.900 --> 50:20.240
 Like, over the stretch of years,

50:20.240 --> 50:22.240
 the way to reduce injury.

50:24.020 --> 50:26.460
 I mean, in wrestling also, technique

50:27.620 --> 50:32.200
 might have greater value than it does in arm wrestling.

50:32.200 --> 50:33.860
 Obviously, technique is extremely important

50:33.860 --> 50:34.740
 in arm wrestling.

50:34.740 --> 50:39.740
 But power can defeat technique, it seems like.

50:40.420 --> 50:42.560
 In wrestling, you can get away.

50:42.560 --> 50:46.620
 There's a lot of ways you can really do sneak attacks,

50:46.620 --> 50:49.000
 sort of use leverage on those kinds of things.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.860
 So there's even more incentive to do play

50:51.860 --> 50:53.420
 and all that kind of stuff.

50:53.420 --> 50:57.060
 But do you see the parallels between the two worlds,

50:57.060 --> 50:58.100
 wrestling and arm wrestling?

50:58.100 --> 50:59.000
 100%.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.500
 Well, you saw what I did the other night, right?

51:01.500 --> 51:04.220
 So I'm playing on the table for hours, right?

51:04.220 --> 51:09.180
 So that's my number one training thing that I do,

51:09.180 --> 51:13.060
 is I go on the table for hours and I play.

51:13.060 --> 51:14.020
 Yeah.

51:14.020 --> 51:16.800
 Yeah, when you did, Sergey, can you pull up that video?

51:16.800 --> 51:20.340
 It's on Devin's channel, the water tank one.

51:20.340 --> 51:22.140
 Oh, it's like 180p.

51:22.140 --> 51:25.220
 It's like, the wifi in there was so bad.

51:25.220 --> 51:26.060
 Yeah.

51:26.060 --> 51:26.900
 It's great, I love it.

51:26.900 --> 51:29.740
 It's, maybe, I don't know if it was fish eye,

51:29.740 --> 51:32.300
 but it had a fish eye feel, it was crowded.

51:32.300 --> 51:34.900
 I mean, so much camaraderie, it was amazing.

51:34.900 --> 51:39.260
 But maybe just a brief mention of Dimitri,

51:39.260 --> 51:42.300
 the Russian guy.

51:42.300 --> 51:47.300
 What, in that play, what are some memorable things here?

51:48.900 --> 51:51.260
 Like, when you go against a bunch of different people,

51:51.260 --> 51:54.020
 a bunch of strangers, what are all the differences

51:54.020 --> 51:56.460
 and how do you grow from them, how do you learn from them?

51:56.460 --> 51:58.000
 Well, everybody's a bit different.

51:58.000 --> 52:02.140
 So, I love to go to new clubs,

52:02.140 --> 52:04.260
 because the energy's always high.

52:04.260 --> 52:06.100
 Like, the first time you go to a club,

52:06.100 --> 52:07.480
 everybody's trying to kill you.

52:07.480 --> 52:08.320
 Yeah.

52:08.320 --> 52:09.140
 Yeah, so they're gonna.

52:09.140 --> 52:09.980
 There's excitement and there's this,

52:09.980 --> 52:11.060
 and so you feed off of that.

52:11.060 --> 52:14.420
 Yeah, you do, you can, if you're able to be strong enough

52:14.420 --> 52:17.780
 to absorb it without injury, it's awesome, it's awesome.

52:19.060 --> 52:20.460
 Because they're giving you everything they can.

52:20.460 --> 52:23.460
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:23.460 --> 52:26.040
 Right, so it's very specific, right?

52:26.040 --> 52:28.100
 Like, I'm gonna get way stronger at arm wrestling.

52:28.100 --> 52:31.360
 And what I try and do, when I go to these places,

52:31.360 --> 52:34.300
 is I make an assumption, I make an assumption

52:34.300 --> 52:36.140
 that I'm the best guy there.

52:36.140 --> 52:41.140
 And so, I'll arm wrestle in a way that kind of protects them,

52:41.420 --> 52:43.400
 because the more I can protect them

52:43.400 --> 52:47.340
 and kind of keep them kind of in a good position,

52:47.340 --> 52:49.700
 they can actually give me more, right?

52:49.700 --> 52:52.760
 So, I kind of give them little pieces

52:52.760 --> 52:55.500
 that I think will put them in a place

52:55.500 --> 52:58.300
 that they can really give me more.

52:58.300 --> 53:00.420
 And so, yeah, that's what I'm doing.

53:00.420 --> 53:03.660
 And then, when I see somebody like Dimitri,

53:03.660 --> 53:06.180
 I pull that in a little bit, right?

53:06.180 --> 53:09.640
 So, okay, so I know Dimitri's the number one guy in Texas.

53:10.800 --> 53:12.340
 Lots of respect to the guy.

53:12.340 --> 53:15.020
 I won't give him all the pieces

53:15.020 --> 53:17.780
 until I really kind of gauge where he's at,

53:17.780 --> 53:21.420
 because I certainly, in training, don't wanna fail.

53:21.420 --> 53:24.020
 I don't want that, I don't want to.

53:24.020 --> 53:26.420
 When you fail in arm wrestling,

53:26.420 --> 53:28.500
 imagine it's just bad technique.

53:28.500 --> 53:30.060
 And you're trying, and bad technique,

53:30.060 --> 53:31.900
 you're gonna get hurt, yeah.

53:31.900 --> 53:34.020
 So, you always want to be in a strong position here.

53:34.020 --> 53:37.060
 What about, how does endurance come into play here?

53:37.060 --> 53:39.980
 And here's video of you strapping up with Dimitri.

53:39.980 --> 53:43.120
 How do you, I mean, you went for like, I don't know,

53:43.120 --> 53:43.960
 two hours?

53:43.960 --> 53:44.900
 Yeah, it was long.

53:44.900 --> 53:47.640
 So, this first run of the video, I think,

53:47.640 --> 53:50.300
 was a little over an hour, and then I took a break,

53:50.300 --> 53:53.380
 and I probably did another 45 minutes or so, but.

53:53.380 --> 53:57.580
 I mean, do you, how can, are you okay

53:57.580 --> 53:58.900
 with the endurance aspect of this?

53:58.900 --> 54:00.820
 Yeah, that's probably, like, when you talk

54:00.820 --> 54:02.260
 to the arm wrestling world, that's probably

54:02.260 --> 54:05.020
 what I'm best known for, is my endurance.

54:05.020 --> 54:07.120
 So, this helps build that.

54:07.120 --> 54:08.860
 It does, but that's not why I'm doing it.

54:08.860 --> 54:11.060
 I'm doing it to get strong.

54:11.060 --> 54:14.780
 In my opinion, this is one of the best ways to get strong,

54:14.780 --> 54:17.980
 especially far away from a tournament,

54:17.980 --> 54:19.380
 or any kind of an event.

54:21.780 --> 54:25.300
 I wouldn't wanna do this, you know, even a month,

54:25.300 --> 54:28.440
 or even six weeks, or even, maybe even eight weeks

54:28.440 --> 54:29.760
 before a big event.

54:29.760 --> 54:33.300
 I'd want to already be kind of shrinking my volume,

54:33.300 --> 54:36.600
 but far away from an event, yeah, as much volume

54:36.600 --> 54:38.540
 as your body can handle, and you'll feel it.

54:38.540 --> 54:39.360
 You'll feel it.

54:39.360 --> 54:41.580
 Like, I felt it at times, like, you know,

54:41.580 --> 54:43.100
 after the hour mark, I'm like, okay,

54:43.100 --> 54:45.600
 I can feel my blood sugar kind of diminishing.

54:45.600 --> 54:48.700
 I can feel, like, the blood that's going to my muscles

54:48.700 --> 54:53.340
 is kinda like, it's not really pushing more good stuff in.

54:53.340 --> 54:56.440
 It's, I'm starting to break down, and you don't want that.

54:56.440 --> 54:57.960
 You don't want that.

54:57.960 --> 54:58.800
 Quick pause.

54:58.800 --> 54:59.900
 Bathroom break?

54:59.900 --> 55:00.900
 I'm good, I'm good.

55:00.900 --> 55:02.580
 I kinda need one.

55:02.580 --> 55:04.380
 I'll maybe get a sweater, it's a bit.

55:04.380 --> 55:05.380
 Is it cold?

55:05.380 --> 55:06.200
 Does that matter?

55:06.200 --> 55:07.900
 Does that care for kind of continuity?

55:07.900 --> 55:08.720
 No, no, no, no.

55:08.720 --> 55:09.560
 I can make it warmer.

55:09.560 --> 55:10.400
 No, no, no, I'll just put a sweater on,

55:10.400 --> 55:12.180
 it's fine, but that doesn't matter.

55:12.180 --> 55:14.400
 And I still love the idea of you going to Russia.

55:14.400 --> 55:15.240
 Yeah.

55:15.240 --> 55:16.340
 And training there.

55:16.340 --> 55:17.180
 Yeah.

55:17.180 --> 55:18.880
 I'm also making a trip out to Russia.

55:18.880 --> 55:19.720
 Oh yeah, when?

55:19.720 --> 55:20.560
 For different reasons.

55:20.560 --> 55:23.260
 Well, it's hard with the current conflict,

55:23.260 --> 55:26.180
 the tensions there, but I'm hoping before your match,

55:26.180 --> 55:29.220
 actually, so May, for a couple of interviews

55:29.220 --> 55:32.800
 with a couple of folks, some of which people know.

55:34.380 --> 55:36.000
 Maybe I could ask you about,

55:37.640 --> 55:40.020
 to comment on some matches that stand out to you

55:40.020 --> 55:42.860
 in your career.

55:42.860 --> 55:43.700
 Sure.

55:45.540 --> 55:48.380
 Is there something, is there a particular,

55:48.380 --> 55:50.060
 I have a bunch that I really enjoy,

55:50.060 --> 55:54.260
 but is there something that stands out to you as memorable?

55:54.260 --> 55:58.860
 We talked about sort of a defining loss, perhaps,

55:58.860 --> 55:59.700
 to Dennis.

56:00.660 --> 56:04.900
 Then you faced Michael Todd, like you mentioned,

56:04.900 --> 56:08.700
 John Brzenk, you faced Matt.

56:09.880 --> 56:11.720
 Is there something that stands out to you

56:11.720 --> 56:14.620
 that technically or psychologically

56:14.620 --> 56:16.660
 you've learned a lot from?

56:17.940 --> 56:20.320
 I feel like I try and learn something from every match,

56:20.320 --> 56:22.660
 but there is a very special match to me

56:22.660 --> 56:25.040
 that to this day, I can't explain.

56:27.900 --> 56:30.340
 Very weird phenomenon.

56:30.340 --> 56:35.340
 So, I think it was 2005 was my first combat tour overseas.

56:38.760 --> 56:42.600
 So, it was a active tour.

56:44.660 --> 56:48.060
 Among other things, I got shot during that tour,

56:48.060 --> 56:51.060
 we got blown, long tour, rough tour.

56:51.060 --> 56:53.580
 And I trained the whole time through

56:53.580 --> 56:55.220
 knowing that at the end of this,

56:55.220 --> 56:56.980
 I was gonna have a big match.

56:56.980 --> 57:01.300
 So, there's a champion, a guy called Ron Bath.

57:02.200 --> 57:05.080
 He's kind of, if there was no John Brzenk,

57:05.080 --> 57:06.700
 there would be Ron Bath.

57:06.700 --> 57:10.220
 Okay, so, extremely decorated,

57:10.220 --> 57:13.240
 unbelievable arm wrestler from the United States.

57:13.240 --> 57:15.340
 And this is kind of when I was just

57:15.340 --> 57:17.620
 kind of coming up in the sport still.

57:17.620 --> 57:18.980
 I was fairly well established,

57:18.980 --> 57:21.060
 I was definitely the best guy in Canada.

57:21.060 --> 57:23.060
 And I had been for a few years,

57:23.060 --> 57:26.840
 but I hadn't really expanded internationally too much.

57:27.700 --> 57:32.460
 So, I had a one on one match with Ron Bath

57:32.460 --> 57:35.340
 and that's the one.

57:35.340 --> 57:39.420
 Yeah, extremely hard fought battle.

57:39.420 --> 57:41.640
 Was three one, I think, three one,

57:41.640 --> 57:44.020
 but every match was really close

57:44.020 --> 57:45.980
 and he won the first one.

57:45.980 --> 57:49.180
 And I had to kind of dig my way out of the trenches

57:49.180 --> 57:51.460
 and ended up coming back and winning.

57:51.460 --> 57:55.300
 But it was a match that was probably,

57:55.300 --> 57:58.300
 it was probably one of my closest matches ever.

57:58.300 --> 58:00.780
 And it was.

58:00.780 --> 58:02.380
 It seems like there's frustration on you.

58:02.380 --> 58:03.220
 What is that?

58:03.220 --> 58:06.740
 What was going through your mind here with these?

58:06.740 --> 58:08.000
 Was it, first of all, going in,

58:08.000 --> 58:09.900
 did you think you could beat him?

58:09.900 --> 58:10.740
 What was the level of confidence?

58:10.740 --> 58:13.500
 I always think I can win, like I always do.

58:13.500 --> 58:16.860
 But, you know, a lot of respect to the guy.

58:17.940 --> 58:20.140
 But yeah, I mean, I always think I can do it.

58:21.340 --> 58:24.660
 So how did, what lessons did you take away from it?

58:24.660 --> 58:26.400
 Why is it so meaningful to you?

58:27.500 --> 58:29.580
 Well, it's what happened afterwards.

58:29.580 --> 58:32.900
 So, I had some kind of a release afterwards.

58:33.980 --> 58:36.300
 And that was the strange thing to me.

58:36.300 --> 58:41.300
 So, match ended and I felt like,

58:41.300 --> 58:46.300
 so relaxed afterwards, so calm, so, so, you know, satisfied.

58:47.620 --> 58:49.780
 Because it was one of those matches

58:49.780 --> 58:52.660
 that kind of takes everything from you, but you win it.

58:53.860 --> 58:56.860
 And I was relaxing in the chair

58:57.820 --> 59:01.500
 and I've never had this sensation before.

59:01.500 --> 59:03.380
 I've never had it afterwards,

59:03.380 --> 59:07.740
 but it's like the center of my backbone just exploded.

59:07.740 --> 59:11.700
 And it was like, it's so weird, right?

59:11.700 --> 59:14.860
 Cause I'm not really spiritual that much or religious even,

59:14.860 --> 59:17.860
 but it's like a fire just ripped through me

59:17.860 --> 59:19.700
 and it only lasted an instant.

59:19.700 --> 59:22.140
 Just exploded through my whole body,

59:22.140 --> 59:25.780
 out the top, through my feet.

59:25.780 --> 59:27.780
 And then it was gone, that was it.

59:27.780 --> 59:30.620
 Weirdest thing I've ever felt in my entire life.

59:32.060 --> 59:35.100
 Yeah, but it was as a result of,

59:35.100 --> 59:39.780
 yeah, but it was as a result of what happened in the match

59:39.780 --> 59:42.700
 and leading up to it, I had some kind of a release.

59:44.100 --> 59:46.820
 To what it does, it almost,

59:46.820 --> 59:48.340
 how did you interpret it psychologically?

59:48.340 --> 59:52.060
 Was it like some kind of, I mean,

59:52.060 --> 59:53.620
 not to be spiritual or whatever,

59:53.620 --> 59:57.580
 but some kind of superpower that was like,

59:58.460 --> 1:00:03.460
 like a lingering feeling like, holy shit, I, you know.

1:00:03.460 --> 1:00:05.540
 I can't, I can't explain it.

1:00:05.540 --> 1:00:09.340
 And I haven't really tried hard enough to try to.

1:00:09.340 --> 1:00:10.660
 But something changed.

1:00:10.660 --> 1:00:12.540
 Something happened there, yeah.

1:00:12.540 --> 1:00:13.460
 Something happened to me.

1:00:13.460 --> 1:00:15.820
 I was sore for about three or four months afterwards.

1:00:15.820 --> 1:00:18.580
 It's like it smoked out my entire body.

1:00:18.580 --> 1:00:21.420
 Yeah, that whole summer I was kind of sore.

1:00:21.420 --> 1:00:23.660
 And yeah, and then after that,

1:00:23.660 --> 1:00:25.140
 like two or three years later,

1:00:25.140 --> 1:00:27.300
 that's when I won the world championships.

1:00:29.020 --> 1:00:30.860
 Yeah, I mean, all the matches are,

1:00:30.860 --> 1:00:33.660
 you know, you get something from people, like, you know,

1:00:33.660 --> 1:00:37.380
 you study them, you take something from them.

1:00:37.380 --> 1:00:42.060
 People have an invisible crown and he had one.

1:00:42.060 --> 1:00:43.620
 And I think I took it from him.

1:00:43.620 --> 1:00:44.460
 Yeah.

1:00:44.460 --> 1:00:45.300
 Yeah.

1:00:45.300 --> 1:00:48.300
 Maybe that was the feeling of wearing the crown.

1:00:48.300 --> 1:00:49.140
 Yeah, maybe.

1:00:50.140 --> 1:00:51.540
 What about all the trash talk?

1:00:51.540 --> 1:00:53.020
 How much of that did you learn?

1:00:53.020 --> 1:00:54.300
 Does that come naturally to you?

1:00:54.300 --> 1:00:56.420
 You're one of the most charismatic, fun.

1:00:56.420 --> 1:00:59.460
 I mean, there's always like respect behind it.

1:00:59.460 --> 1:01:02.580
 I would say to me, and I'm a fan of a lot of sports,

1:01:02.580 --> 1:01:06.300
 you're one of the greatest trash talkers in all of sports

1:01:06.300 --> 1:01:09.620
 that I've ever seen because you're able to talk shit,

1:01:10.620 --> 1:01:13.180
 but there's so much love and respect behind it.

1:01:13.180 --> 1:01:14.340
 It's just masterful.

1:01:14.340 --> 1:01:17.260
 But you also get into people's heads in the moment.

1:01:17.260 --> 1:01:18.380
 It's beautiful to watch

1:01:18.380 --> 1:01:21.660
 because it really gets to some people.

1:01:21.660 --> 1:01:22.860
 So where does that come from?

1:01:22.860 --> 1:01:24.580
 It's a powerful weapon, right?

1:01:24.580 --> 1:01:25.420
 Yeah.

1:01:25.420 --> 1:01:28.260
 Your voice is a powerful, powerful weapon.

1:01:28.260 --> 1:01:31.420
 And it's underutilized by so many athletes

1:01:31.420 --> 1:01:34.860
 because they think that it's not sportsmanlike

1:01:34.860 --> 1:01:37.180
 or something like that.

1:01:37.180 --> 1:01:42.180
 But the truth is, I mean, you can be a weak person,

1:01:43.900 --> 1:01:46.620
 but with your voice, you can influence

1:01:46.620 --> 1:01:48.820
 and change any number of things.

1:01:48.820 --> 1:01:52.340
 And the same thing happens in a fight between two people.

1:01:52.340 --> 1:01:55.860
 If you can just be a never ending, you know,

1:01:55.860 --> 1:01:59.940
 flow of negative encouragement to someone

1:01:59.940 --> 1:02:04.940
 or, you know, suggestion, anything can happen.

1:02:05.740 --> 1:02:06.900
 It's a tool.

1:02:08.300 --> 1:02:11.260
 And when you're fighting a person,

1:02:11.260 --> 1:02:13.340
 you're not just fighting them.

1:02:13.340 --> 1:02:15.820
 You're fighting everyone who's watching.

1:02:15.820 --> 1:02:19.220
 You're fighting the crowd, the referees.

1:02:19.220 --> 1:02:24.220
 And, you know, to get in the most ideal positions,

1:02:24.220 --> 1:02:27.540
 situations, you need to use your voice, yeah.

1:02:27.540 --> 1:02:30.500
 Yeah, and there's, for people who haven't seen,

1:02:30.500 --> 1:02:32.020
 I definitely recommend you watch

1:02:32.020 --> 1:02:33.300
 a bunch of arm wrestling matches

1:02:33.300 --> 1:02:36.020
 because there's a crowd really gets into it.

1:02:36.020 --> 1:02:38.940
 And it feels like there's a really intimate connection

1:02:38.940 --> 1:02:39.860
 with the crowd.

1:02:39.860 --> 1:02:41.340
 I suppose because the crowd is allowed

1:02:41.340 --> 1:02:42.180
 to be very close to you.

1:02:42.180 --> 1:02:43.980
 Yeah, I love it.

1:02:45.140 --> 1:02:47.500
 I want the crowd like right up on me.

1:02:47.500 --> 1:02:48.700
 Yeah. Yeah.

1:02:48.700 --> 1:02:52.820
 So sometimes, oh yeah.

1:02:52.820 --> 1:02:56.420
 So who are you, whenever you talk to somebody,

1:02:56.420 --> 1:02:58.220
 you literally pick somebody from the crowd?

1:02:58.220 --> 1:02:59.060
 Oh yeah.

1:02:59.060 --> 1:03:02.420
 Oh yeah, I'll fucking, like I'll start fucking off

1:03:02.420 --> 1:03:06.540
 his fans and like, yeah, like I'll start talking

1:03:06.540 --> 1:03:08.340
 to their wives or whatever.

1:03:08.340 --> 1:03:11.700
 Yeah, yeah, there's Jody.

1:03:12.860 --> 1:03:16.100
 She's pretty dangerous to listen to also.

1:03:16.100 --> 1:03:18.300
 But yeah, one of his buddies, Mike Solares,

1:03:18.300 --> 1:03:21.540
 who's, you know, really good arm wrestler,

1:03:21.540 --> 1:03:25.300
 was cheering for him, so I started to go after him.

1:03:25.300 --> 1:03:26.700
 Yeah. Yeah.

1:03:26.700 --> 1:03:27.740
 Smiling the whole time.

1:03:27.740 --> 1:03:29.060
 Yeah, it's fun, right?

1:03:29.060 --> 1:03:29.900
 It's fun.

1:03:29.900 --> 1:03:31.740
 It's a fan, it's fun to listen to,

1:03:31.740 --> 1:03:35.300
 but it's also, what's fun is how much it actually affects

1:03:35.300 --> 1:03:36.620
 some of the people you're facing.

1:03:36.620 --> 1:03:37.700
 They get frustrated.

1:03:37.700 --> 1:03:38.540
 Yeah.

1:03:38.540 --> 1:03:39.380
 It's great to see.

1:03:39.380 --> 1:03:40.860
 Well, you have to fight, right?

1:03:40.860 --> 1:03:43.940
 Like a lot of people think things will be given to them.

1:03:43.940 --> 1:03:47.100
 And the thing that, you know, I've always believed

1:03:47.100 --> 1:03:48.460
 from the time I was very young,

1:03:48.460 --> 1:03:53.460
 like I was convinced that our inevitable death

1:03:54.820 --> 1:03:57.100
 was gonna come from aliens, right?

1:03:57.100 --> 1:04:01.300
 Like some super aggressive, super violent species

1:04:01.300 --> 1:04:03.740
 was gonna come and smoke us all, you know?

1:04:03.740 --> 1:04:06.620
 And I'm like, I'm not like that.

1:04:06.620 --> 1:04:09.140
 I'm like, but as soon as one person is,

1:04:09.140 --> 1:04:12.900
 then you're forced to have to accept it as reality, right?

1:04:12.900 --> 1:04:17.900
 So I like to fight for every single thing.

1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:20.500
 I like to try and be more and more aggressive.

1:04:20.500 --> 1:04:22.380
 And if someone matches me,

1:04:22.380 --> 1:04:24.140
 that's when I can use my endurance.

1:04:24.140 --> 1:04:27.580
 And if they don't, then I have the tactical advantage.

1:04:27.580 --> 1:04:29.300
 So that's kind of my balance point.

1:04:29.300 --> 1:04:31.820
 And then, by the way, you also yell at the ref.

1:04:31.820 --> 1:04:32.660
 Yeah.

1:04:32.660 --> 1:04:35.540
 I mean, the games, there's like levels to this game,

1:04:35.540 --> 1:04:37.580
 but you know, the feeling sometimes

1:04:37.580 --> 1:04:38.820
 when people get frustrated is like,

1:04:38.820 --> 1:04:40.500
 okay, this person's cheating,

1:04:40.500 --> 1:04:43.580
 or like you're trying to get a good grip

1:04:43.580 --> 1:04:47.460
 before it goes.

1:04:47.460 --> 1:04:50.140
 And I think some of the frustration

1:04:50.140 --> 1:04:52.260
 in combination with the trash talk is,

1:04:52.260 --> 1:04:54.020
 well, this person is cheating,

1:04:54.020 --> 1:04:56.580
 but everybody is like kind of trying to cheat,

1:04:56.580 --> 1:04:58.820
 get an edge within the rules.

1:04:58.820 --> 1:04:59.740
 Yeah.

1:04:59.740 --> 1:05:02.980
 So I try and just ramp it, ramp it, ramp it.

1:05:04.460 --> 1:05:06.740
 But you know, everybody's different.

1:05:06.740 --> 1:05:08.860
 I've learned how to play the game

1:05:08.860 --> 1:05:11.300
 based off of the tools that I have physically.

1:05:11.300 --> 1:05:14.740
 And for me, this works because, you know,

1:05:14.740 --> 1:05:19.460
 my genetic makeup is more of a persistence hunter, right?

1:05:19.460 --> 1:05:21.540
 So like, I need to extend things,

1:05:21.540 --> 1:05:23.980
 and that works well for me.

1:05:25.660 --> 1:05:28.980
 You know, if I was more explosive,

1:05:28.980 --> 1:05:31.540
 I probably wouldn't have the same strategies.

1:05:31.540 --> 1:05:32.380
 Yeah.

1:05:33.340 --> 1:05:36.300
 By the way, for people who are watching,

1:05:36.300 --> 1:05:37.740
 you're wearing a No Limits hoodie,

1:05:37.740 --> 1:05:40.260
 which is one of your nicknames.

1:05:40.260 --> 1:05:42.380
 I don't wash this thing too much.

1:05:42.380 --> 1:05:45.460
 It's my bacterial shield to the world.

1:05:45.460 --> 1:05:46.300
 Yeah.

1:05:46.300 --> 1:05:47.540
 Yeah.

1:05:47.540 --> 1:05:48.380
 Awesome.

1:05:48.380 --> 1:05:49.220
 So you mentioned Jody.

1:05:49.220 --> 1:05:51.180
 She's often in your corner

1:05:51.180 --> 1:05:54.820
 and does perhaps more trash talking than even you.

1:05:54.820 --> 1:05:58.460
 So I mean, if we could step away,

1:05:58.460 --> 1:06:00.060
 she's an incredible human being.

1:06:00.060 --> 1:06:04.140
 As sort of as a fan, it's fun to watch the two of you,

1:06:04.140 --> 1:06:07.380
 both when you're arm wrestling and just as people.

1:06:07.380 --> 1:06:11.660
 I just see so much, I don't know,

1:06:11.660 --> 1:06:14.860
 kindness and love radiating from the two of you

1:06:14.860 --> 1:06:17.100
 whenever you're trash talking

1:06:17.100 --> 1:06:19.540
 or talking about just random things

1:06:19.540 --> 1:06:20.620
 or just talking about life.

1:06:20.620 --> 1:06:22.020
 It's just a beautiful thing to watch.

1:06:22.020 --> 1:06:23.460
 And thank you for sharing that with the world.

1:06:23.460 --> 1:06:28.460
 But maybe can you, she paid me to ask you this,

1:06:28.780 --> 1:06:32.220
 but what are the things you love about Jody,

1:06:32.220 --> 1:06:33.500
 your wife, Jody Laird?

1:06:33.500 --> 1:06:37.580
 What are the ways she's affected your life?

1:06:38.540 --> 1:06:39.980
 Yeah.

1:06:39.980 --> 1:06:42.660
 Jody and I go way back, right?

1:06:42.660 --> 1:06:44.220
 We were in high school together.

1:06:46.700 --> 1:06:51.700
 The thing that I admire most in people is bravery.

1:06:53.900 --> 1:06:56.780
 To me, it's the most admirable quality.

1:06:57.780 --> 1:07:02.780
 And Jody always has inspired me

1:07:02.780 --> 1:07:04.780
 because she's such a fighter.

1:07:04.780 --> 1:07:07.780
 If she believes that something's true,

1:07:09.180 --> 1:07:10.780
 she does not back down.

1:07:10.780 --> 1:07:11.860
 She will not.

1:07:11.860 --> 1:07:14.980
 And not to say that she can't change her mind

1:07:14.980 --> 1:07:19.300
 because she can, but while she is convicted,

1:07:19.300 --> 1:07:21.300
 she will not stop fighting.

1:07:22.500 --> 1:07:25.340
 She's pulled me out of the fire repeatedly.

1:07:25.340 --> 1:07:28.540
 We've lived through so many things.

1:07:28.540 --> 1:07:29.580
 Very lucky.

1:07:29.580 --> 1:07:32.180
 How has she made you a better arm wrestler?

1:07:32.180 --> 1:07:33.100
 She's fed me.

1:07:35.340 --> 1:07:38.260
 Yeah, I could see your videos of your house

1:07:38.260 --> 1:07:40.460
 basically coming apart when she's not there.

1:07:40.460 --> 1:07:41.300
 Yeah.

1:07:42.860 --> 1:07:46.740
 Yeah, without Jody, I'm on the street living in a tent

1:07:46.740 --> 1:07:50.060
 and yeah, eating dog food.

1:07:50.060 --> 1:07:50.900
 Yeah.

1:07:53.500 --> 1:07:54.460
 Bravery.

1:07:54.460 --> 1:07:55.300
 Yeah.

1:07:55.300 --> 1:07:56.140
 What about love?

1:07:56.140 --> 1:07:57.620
 How has love made you stronger?

1:07:57.620 --> 1:08:00.100
 Now we're gonna make Devin uncomfortable.

1:08:00.100 --> 1:08:03.220
 Yeah, love is difficult to accept.

1:08:04.300 --> 1:08:06.460
 Love is one of those things that,

1:08:08.460 --> 1:08:11.540
 a lot of times, you don't feel worthy of it.

1:08:12.700 --> 1:08:15.900
 And so it's hard sometimes to accept someone's love.

1:08:15.900 --> 1:08:18.940
 And someone who really loves you,

1:08:18.940 --> 1:08:20.900
 they'll love you even when you don't.

1:08:22.300 --> 1:08:25.060
 And here you go, you're gonna make me cry, Alex.

1:08:25.060 --> 1:08:29.020
 Yeah, Jody and I have been through so much.

1:08:29.020 --> 1:08:34.020
 And she's shown me how she supported me

1:08:35.500 --> 1:08:37.660
 just repeatedly, repeatedly.

1:08:37.660 --> 1:08:40.660
 Some of that is loyalty and patience and perseverance

1:08:40.660 --> 1:08:41.860
 and all those things.

1:08:41.860 --> 1:08:46.220
 That's like when love really shows itself.

1:08:46.220 --> 1:08:47.060
 Yeah.

1:08:47.060 --> 1:08:49.420
 It's like sticking through together for years

1:08:49.420 --> 1:08:52.660
 even when you're through the shitty times.

1:08:52.660 --> 1:08:57.060
 Love and faith are powerful forces in this universe.

1:08:57.060 --> 1:09:02.020
 Without them, we can descend into darkness very quickly.

1:09:02.020 --> 1:09:04.660
 As a world, even between people.

1:09:04.660 --> 1:09:09.660
 When love and faith is destroyed, then we fall apart.

1:09:11.020 --> 1:09:16.020
 And I've been graced by the love that Jody's given me.

1:09:16.460 --> 1:09:19.860
 It's allowed me to continue to build.

1:09:19.860 --> 1:09:22.700
 When you have love between people, then you build together.

1:09:23.820 --> 1:09:27.780
 I love my family, I love Canada,

1:09:27.780 --> 1:09:29.380
 I love the arm wrestling community.

1:09:29.380 --> 1:09:31.580
 I have a love for what we're trying to achieve

1:09:31.580 --> 1:09:33.700
 as a human species, you know?

1:09:33.700 --> 1:09:38.700
 And when that falls apart, we don't have much.

1:09:38.700 --> 1:09:42.500
 Yeah, just with my boy there, yeah.

1:09:42.500 --> 1:09:43.340
 Yeah.

1:09:43.340 --> 1:09:48.340
 You also mentioned you once had a job

1:09:50.580 --> 1:09:54.540
 where your death was a real possibility.

1:09:54.540 --> 1:09:56.980
 So you were in the Canadian Special Forces.

1:09:56.980 --> 1:10:00.540
 What did you take away from that experience,

1:10:01.420 --> 1:10:02.900
 that time in your life?

1:10:02.900 --> 1:10:05.820
 It was such a great life.

1:10:05.820 --> 1:10:07.100
 Really, really loved it.

1:10:07.100 --> 1:10:09.620
 Honestly, I never wanted to leave.

1:10:09.620 --> 1:10:10.820
 I never thought I would leave.

1:10:10.820 --> 1:10:15.220
 I thought I'd be there my whole life.

1:10:15.220 --> 1:10:18.260
 A real honor to get to serve.

1:10:18.260 --> 1:10:19.420
 What did you get to do?

1:10:19.420 --> 1:10:22.380
 What was the things you loved craftsmanship wise,

1:10:22.380 --> 1:10:25.900
 like fun things you get to do, learn and challenge yourself?

1:10:25.900 --> 1:10:30.900
 And you mentioned sort of honor in terms of the serving part.

1:10:31.180 --> 1:10:32.020
 Yeah.

1:10:33.220 --> 1:10:38.220
 Yeah, my favorite thing about serving in the Special Forces

1:10:38.220 --> 1:10:40.540
 was for sure the people that I worked with.

1:10:40.540 --> 1:10:43.900
 That's probably the first thing I could say, you know,

1:10:43.900 --> 1:10:48.340
 I never, I always felt like totally comfortable

1:10:48.340 --> 1:10:51.500
 and putting my life in the other guy's hands.

1:10:51.500 --> 1:10:56.500
 I was so happy to be in a place where I felt I could follow.

1:10:56.500 --> 1:10:59.580
 Like didn't matter.

1:10:59.580 --> 1:11:03.380
 Like I knew that the people ahead of me were incredible.

1:11:03.380 --> 1:11:05.940
 I knew the people beside me were incredible.

1:11:05.940 --> 1:11:09.900
 So just having that faith in your team, it's very special.

1:11:09.900 --> 1:11:12.580
 And to know that they're there for a reason

1:11:12.580 --> 1:11:15.180
 that has nothing to do with money, you know,

1:11:15.180 --> 1:11:17.740
 and that's what kind of brings everybody together

1:11:17.740 --> 1:11:19.700
 is you're there for a higher purpose.

1:11:21.100 --> 1:11:24.380
 And in terms of being an adrenaline junkie,

1:11:24.380 --> 1:11:25.620
 there's nothing like it.

1:11:25.620 --> 1:11:27.420
 I mean, there's nothing like, you know,

1:11:27.420 --> 1:11:29.820
 going out at night and fighting.

1:11:29.820 --> 1:11:33.860
 And when I say fighting, like my whole life I wanted to fight.

1:11:33.860 --> 1:11:38.860
 And to me, there's a lot of, and look at,

1:11:39.220 --> 1:11:40.740
 I've said this in the past

1:11:40.740 --> 1:11:43.100
 and I think it's been a personal failure of mine

1:11:43.100 --> 1:11:44.740
 because I've said things like,

1:11:44.740 --> 1:11:46.380
 it's the highest level that you can do.

1:11:46.380 --> 1:11:48.220
 And I don't believe that to be true anymore.

1:11:48.220 --> 1:11:52.740
 But at the time, I thought it was the best way

1:11:52.740 --> 1:11:56.580
 I could express my drives that I had, you know,

1:11:56.580 --> 1:11:57.580
 to be a fighter.

1:11:58.780 --> 1:12:02.060
 So your sense in the past and maybe in part now

1:12:02.060 --> 1:12:05.820
 is that sort of fighting is when humans get a chance

1:12:05.820 --> 1:12:10.820
 to express themselves deeply, like that mix of the bravery,

1:12:12.180 --> 1:12:17.180
 the integrity, the, whatever that is that makes us human,

1:12:17.620 --> 1:12:19.420
 that human spirit can really shine.

1:12:19.420 --> 1:12:21.060
 And I don't believe that anymore.

1:12:21.060 --> 1:12:24.220
 I believe that you can do that in any field,

1:12:24.220 --> 1:12:26.860
 in any discipline, you know, if you go hard enough,

1:12:26.860 --> 1:12:28.980
 it all kind of starts to feel the same.

1:12:28.980 --> 1:12:31.740
 But at the time, that, you know,

1:12:31.740 --> 1:12:34.380
 expression to me was really, really awesome.

1:12:34.380 --> 1:12:36.580
 I loved close quarter battle.

1:12:36.580 --> 1:12:37.900
 That was my favorite thing.

1:12:37.900 --> 1:12:40.100
 That's really the whole reason I was there.

1:12:41.220 --> 1:12:43.300
 Can you describe close quarter battle?

1:12:43.300 --> 1:12:46.820
 Close quarter battle is team fighting.

1:12:46.820 --> 1:12:50.420
 So, and it can look a lot of different ways,

1:12:50.420 --> 1:12:55.420
 but basically it's ground troops doing something

1:12:55.420 --> 1:13:00.420
 and it's ground troops doing some kind of a mission.

1:13:00.460 --> 1:13:04.180
 And it's the orchestrated movement that is the skill.

1:13:04.180 --> 1:13:08.060
 The orchestrated movement and the drills done quickly

1:13:08.060 --> 1:13:10.140
 and accurately, it's very difficult to do.

1:13:10.140 --> 1:13:11.740
 With communication?

1:13:11.740 --> 1:13:12.580
 With communication.

1:13:12.580 --> 1:13:16.260
 Yeah, so it's basically cooperating together,

1:13:16.260 --> 1:13:18.260
 communicating, there's some strategy,

1:13:18.260 --> 1:13:20.900
 there's some adapting to the changing environment.

1:13:20.900 --> 1:13:22.420
 And the more the team works together,

1:13:22.420 --> 1:13:24.060
 the less communication there is.

1:13:24.060 --> 1:13:26.220
 Yeah, yeah.

1:13:26.220 --> 1:13:28.140
 And that's an amazing thing to do,

1:13:28.140 --> 1:13:30.740
 to be part of a machine, well, machine,

1:13:30.740 --> 1:13:35.020
 a team of people who can fight together like that.

1:13:35.780 --> 1:13:39.900
 I think it's, we're really designed to do it.

1:13:39.900 --> 1:13:42.700
 Like, as good as we can fight as individuals,

1:13:42.700 --> 1:13:43.940
 the thing that makes us really good

1:13:43.940 --> 1:13:46.420
 is our ability to fight as a team.

1:13:46.420 --> 1:13:47.740
 Yeah.

1:13:47.740 --> 1:13:50.500
 Yeah, that's one of the things that makes us really human

1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:52.940
 is that collective intelligence, that social aspect.

1:13:52.940 --> 1:13:56.620
 And fighting is the highest of stakes.

1:13:56.620 --> 1:13:59.260
 So that social interaction under the highest of stakes

1:13:59.260 --> 1:14:04.260
 is, really does bring out something that's deeply human.

1:14:06.340 --> 1:14:10.380
 I mean, war in general brings out something deeply human.

1:14:10.380 --> 1:14:11.580
 It does.

1:14:11.580 --> 1:14:15.380
 It's, I mean, obvious to say that it's tragic

1:14:15.380 --> 1:14:20.380
 that it results in so much loss of life and well being.

1:14:20.380 --> 1:14:25.380
 Let me, if it's okay, for a brief moment

1:14:25.380 --> 1:14:28.700
 to take us back to arm wrestling.

1:14:28.700 --> 1:14:31.660
 We did this offline, we talked about,

1:14:31.660 --> 1:14:34.020
 you gave me some advice about arm wrestling.

1:14:34.020 --> 1:14:35.820
 But maybe do a high level overview

1:14:35.820 --> 1:14:40.820
 of the different styles and strategies

1:14:42.500 --> 1:14:43.420
 that we've talked about.

1:14:43.420 --> 1:14:46.640
 We talked about the importance of strength and power.

1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:49.940
 But is there offensive, defensive styles?

1:14:49.940 --> 1:14:52.700
 Is there, we mentioned King's move.

1:14:52.700 --> 1:14:55.780
 What would you classify your style as?

1:14:55.780 --> 1:14:58.300
 It's nice for people that don't know.

1:14:58.300 --> 1:14:59.700
 Maybe even zoom back out.

1:14:59.700 --> 1:15:04.700
 So arm wrestling is a sport where two people have to,

1:15:08.220 --> 1:15:09.800
 when we talk about strictly the sport,

1:15:09.800 --> 1:15:12.180
 put their elbow on a particular pad,

1:15:12.180 --> 1:15:15.420
 means they have to keep that elbow on that pad.

1:15:15.420 --> 1:15:20.420
 And they win when the back of one of their hands

1:15:20.820 --> 1:15:23.820
 crosses some kind of, or basically touches the table.

1:15:23.820 --> 1:15:24.820
 That's it.

1:15:24.820 --> 1:15:29.820
 And when you actually lock up, you do so,

1:15:30.420 --> 1:15:33.720
 depending on the organization, without straps,

1:15:33.720 --> 1:15:37.840
 meaning there's just you, agree, it's like mutual agreement

1:15:37.840 --> 1:15:42.840
 that you're going to clasp your hands in a way that's fair

1:15:42.840 --> 1:15:45.560
 and there's a referee that helps ensure that it's fair.

1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:47.880
 But of course there's these little games going on.

1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:51.300
 And then when you actually go all out with this battle,

1:15:51.300 --> 1:15:53.800
 if there's no straps, you can slip out.

1:15:53.800 --> 1:15:57.040
 So often you'll put the straps, which means you're,

1:15:57.040 --> 1:16:01.520
 it's like marriage, you're committed for,

1:16:01.520 --> 1:16:04.280
 like somebody will have to lose essentially.

1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:05.540
 There's no pulling out.

1:16:06.520 --> 1:16:11.240
 So that's sort of the battle within that.

1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:13.440
 What are the different styles that you can speak to

1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:17.560
 that people that don't know arm wrestling could understand?

1:16:17.560 --> 1:16:19.260
 Yeah, we can start to kind of just dance

1:16:19.260 --> 1:16:21.120
 around the subject a bit.

1:16:21.120 --> 1:16:25.840
 I'd say there's a lot of different types.

1:16:25.840 --> 1:16:30.840
 There's specialists and there's kind of blenders

1:16:31.280 --> 1:16:33.000
 and people who are very versatile.

1:16:34.400 --> 1:16:38.280
 A lot of guys win world championships on one singular move.

1:16:38.280 --> 1:16:43.280
 They get just extremely crisp at say a hook or a top roll.

1:16:43.700 --> 1:16:46.900
 And their style is very kind of focused.

1:16:46.900 --> 1:16:49.560
 And you'll see it with a lot of athletes,

1:16:49.560 --> 1:16:54.160
 like kind of a talk about guy who's very active,

1:16:54.160 --> 1:16:55.880
 a guy called Jerry Cataret.

1:16:55.880 --> 1:16:57.740
 As soon as you think Jerry Cataret,

1:16:57.740 --> 1:16:58.960
 he's got a very unique style.

1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:01.040
 He's got a flop wrist press.

1:17:01.040 --> 1:17:04.680
 So most of his technique is built around this one system.

1:17:04.680 --> 1:17:09.680
 Flop wrist means what it sounds like.

1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:12.760
 Your wrist is flopped, so it looks like you're losing.

1:17:12.760 --> 1:17:15.480
 So he is pushing from a losing position.

1:17:15.480 --> 1:17:18.060
 No, he will be offensive.

1:17:18.060 --> 1:17:20.360
 So he will be in a press, so offensively,

1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:22.500
 so he'll give his hand away

1:17:22.500 --> 1:17:24.720
 so that he can get his shoulder behind it properly.

1:17:24.720 --> 1:17:27.360
 So he doesn't, wow.

1:17:27.360 --> 1:17:31.160
 So you can press, press means push.

1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:36.160
 Push, yeah, without having that hook position.

1:17:36.680 --> 1:17:40.320
 Which is what most people are always looking for.

1:17:40.320 --> 1:17:41.800
 And Jerry's looking for it as well.

1:17:41.800 --> 1:17:43.720
 And then, so example, there's another one.

1:17:43.720 --> 1:17:45.880
 There's another specialist, Matt Mask.

1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:47.760
 He's a top roller, right?

1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:51.760
 Basically, that's his great move is a top roll.

1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:54.720
 And his other weapons aren't nearly as powerful.

1:17:55.720 --> 1:17:57.840
 Just incredible top roll.

1:17:57.840 --> 1:18:00.760
 And then you have a lot of athletes that are more blended.

1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:02.360
 They have a lot of good options.

1:18:03.680 --> 1:18:07.120
 I think that I probably fall more into that category.

1:18:07.120 --> 1:18:10.760
 You have people who are more speed guys, okay?

1:18:10.760 --> 1:18:15.760
 So they try and do very little, I call it attrition, right?

1:18:17.040 --> 1:18:21.400
 So a lot of people are very willing to trade energy, right?

1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:24.600
 Because they have faith that their gas tank

1:18:24.600 --> 1:18:27.280
 or their pool eventually will tire the other person out.

1:18:27.280 --> 1:18:30.280
 So anytime there's a trade, they'll trade.

1:18:30.280 --> 1:18:32.520
 Whereas a guy like Travis Bajan,

1:18:33.800 --> 1:18:35.800
 he was very, very well known

1:18:35.800 --> 1:18:38.600
 as being extremely explosive, right?

1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:42.260
 But if the match stops, typically he's gonna lose.

1:18:43.160 --> 1:18:47.600
 All right, so based off of your genetics, your hands,

1:18:48.520 --> 1:18:50.560
 there's a lot of ways to skin it.

1:18:50.560 --> 1:18:55.560
 So I think you said something like you're a 22nd guy.

1:18:55.560 --> 1:19:00.280
 That's right, I'm a 22nd guy.

1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:03.220
 So what are the seconds we're talking about?

1:19:03.220 --> 1:19:04.760
 So a lot of the power people,

1:19:04.760 --> 1:19:06.840
 they want to win in the first maybe five seconds,

1:19:06.840 --> 1:19:10.880
 like just that first push, that first press.

1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:14.600
 Absolutely, right to the pad, yeah.

1:19:14.600 --> 1:19:17.400
 And so you're trying to hold off that attack.

1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:19.440
 Yeah, if I beat you in a second,

1:19:19.440 --> 1:19:21.720
 we're not in the same world, yeah.

1:19:21.720 --> 1:19:25.580
 But when I'm with my peer group,

1:19:25.580 --> 1:19:28.900
 I will typically win 20 seconds and beyond.

1:19:28.900 --> 1:19:31.800
 That's a typical win for me when I'm with a peer.

1:19:33.180 --> 1:19:35.780
 Whereas other guys, when they're with their peers,

1:19:35.780 --> 1:19:37.380
 they'll win in a second, right?

1:19:37.380 --> 1:19:40.060
 That's how they do it, that's the way they're built,

1:19:40.060 --> 1:19:41.700
 that's the way they train.

1:19:43.340 --> 1:19:46.100
 Yeah, most guys at a higher level at all

1:19:46.100 --> 1:19:49.380
 starts to kind of, it starts to get more and more difficult

1:19:49.380 --> 1:19:51.860
 to be a specialist at the high level now.

1:19:51.860 --> 1:19:54.300
 Some people just have little holes in their games.

1:19:56.260 --> 1:20:00.380
 It's rare to get someone who can really do all the moves.

1:20:00.380 --> 1:20:01.460
 It's very rare.

1:20:04.220 --> 1:20:05.620
 Where would you put Levan?

1:20:06.740 --> 1:20:08.740
 I would not say he's a specialist.

1:20:08.740 --> 1:20:11.700
 I'd say his top roll is his strongest move.

1:20:11.700 --> 1:20:12.540
 Top roll?

1:20:12.540 --> 1:20:14.780
 Top roll is his strongest move, yeah.

1:20:14.780 --> 1:20:18.700
 And the interesting thing about the specialist

1:20:18.700 --> 1:20:23.700
 versus the blender, there's a counter, right?

1:20:23.900 --> 1:20:27.420
 Every move has a move that theoretically

1:20:27.420 --> 1:20:29.460
 should be the right choice.

1:20:29.460 --> 1:20:31.760
 So if you're a single move guy,

1:20:33.300 --> 1:20:35.700
 there's gonna be a guy out there who'll get you.

1:20:35.700 --> 1:20:38.460
 Yeah, it'll be very difficult for you to beat that guy.

1:20:39.460 --> 1:20:43.220
 But when you come to a tournament,

1:20:43.220 --> 1:20:45.660
 typically specialists do much better

1:20:45.660 --> 1:20:49.460
 in tournament scenarios because their singular move

1:20:49.460 --> 1:20:50.940
 can get them through a tournament

1:20:50.940 --> 1:20:53.140
 very quickly and efficiently.

1:20:53.140 --> 1:20:55.340
 Whereas you get a blender in a tournament,

1:20:55.340 --> 1:20:58.980
 they typically will have longer and more difficult matches.

1:20:58.980 --> 1:21:00.980
 And by, oh, right, yeah.

1:21:00.980 --> 1:21:05.860
 But in supermatch format, typically blenders do better.

1:21:06.780 --> 1:21:09.700
 So we offline also talked about arm sumo

1:21:09.700 --> 1:21:11.540
 or freedom arm wrestling.

1:21:11.540 --> 1:21:12.740
 I don't know how you wanna call it.

1:21:12.740 --> 1:21:13.740
 Oh, I love freedom.

1:21:13.740 --> 1:21:18.740
 Well, exactly, North American way.

1:21:20.580 --> 1:21:25.420
 So this is this idea, and I watched a few videos,

1:21:25.420 --> 1:21:29.020
 and it looks fun, is basically removing the restriction

1:21:29.020 --> 1:21:32.120
 of having to keep your elbow on the pad

1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:35.420
 and just being able to arm wrestle over the whole table.

1:21:35.420 --> 1:21:38.040
 I think you've mentioned that the criticism that gets

1:21:38.040 --> 1:21:40.820
 is it might be injury prone or something like that.

1:21:40.820 --> 1:21:44.260
 So can you describe this arm sumo, freedom arm wrestling

1:21:44.260 --> 1:21:45.540
 idea?

1:21:45.540 --> 1:21:47.520
 When you come to freedom arm wrestling,

1:21:47.520 --> 1:21:50.620
 basically it removes the limitation

1:21:50.620 --> 1:21:52.820
 of a standard arm wrestling table.

1:21:52.820 --> 1:21:54.420
 So basically every single thing

1:21:54.420 --> 1:21:56.040
 is a freedom arm wrestling table.

1:21:56.040 --> 1:21:57.900
 Some are better than others.

1:21:57.900 --> 1:22:00.700
 So looking for that nice table where we can kind of

1:22:00.700 --> 1:22:04.420
 stand apart from each other and we're anatomically

1:22:04.420 --> 1:22:07.020
 in a fairly safe position.

1:22:07.020 --> 1:22:09.740
 And the rules in freedom, the way you win,

1:22:09.740 --> 1:22:14.100
 is the knuckles must either touch the tabletop

1:22:14.100 --> 1:22:17.940
 or you hold it off the edge for a three count.

1:22:18.820 --> 1:22:20.180
 So this is the main way to win.

1:22:20.180 --> 1:22:21.980
 Yes, you can foul, like if you lift your elbow up,

1:22:21.980 --> 1:22:25.140
 it's still a foul, but you have the entire playing surface.

1:22:25.140 --> 1:22:28.040
 So your elbow's no longer limited to your seven by seven

1:22:28.040 --> 1:22:30.940
 or seven by nine pad, so you can move it all over the table.

1:22:30.940 --> 1:22:33.980
 You can move your body around the table a bit too.

1:22:33.980 --> 1:22:36.100
 And if it's a big table, your body

1:22:36.100 --> 1:22:38.180
 could largely be on the table.

1:22:38.180 --> 1:22:41.060
 Yeah, so basically it's like adjusting your ring size.

1:22:41.060 --> 1:22:44.620
 So arm wrestling, you're fighting in a phone booth, right?

1:22:44.620 --> 1:22:47.860
 So you're fighting in a field, you're fighting just bigger.

1:22:47.860 --> 1:22:50.200
 So it just makes the sport bigger.

1:22:50.200 --> 1:22:51.420
 Yeah, this is Japan.

1:22:51.420 --> 1:22:55.840
 But even on a small table, even in a slightly larger

1:22:55.840 --> 1:22:59.460
 phone booth, you can get a lot more fun and variety.

1:22:59.460 --> 1:23:00.300
 It's very interesting to watch.

1:23:00.300 --> 1:23:01.380
 I love it.

1:23:01.380 --> 1:23:02.780
 I think it makes the sport bigger.

1:23:02.780 --> 1:23:05.420
 I actually believe that it's the future of the sport.

1:23:05.420 --> 1:23:06.780
 I really do.

1:23:06.780 --> 1:23:08.060
 Because it makes it more accessible.

1:23:08.060 --> 1:23:09.220
 Like you don't need the equipment.

1:23:09.220 --> 1:23:11.260
 You can do it at a bar, all that kind of stuff.

1:23:11.260 --> 1:23:14.320
 Yeah, less equipment requirements.

1:23:15.660 --> 1:23:16.960
 Most kids start freedom.

1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:19.740
 Like most kids arm wrestle on school desks.

1:23:19.740 --> 1:23:22.180
 And like if you see a guy on the street, you're like,

1:23:22.180 --> 1:23:23.660
 whatever, you can arm wrestle anywhere.

1:23:23.660 --> 1:23:26.380
 You don't need to bring your table around with you.

1:23:26.380 --> 1:23:29.800
 If we talked about the elite level,

1:23:29.800 --> 1:23:34.800
 if somebody was interested in starting in arm wrestling

1:23:34.800 --> 1:23:39.800
 or going from just like, you go to the gym,

1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:43.800
 you kind of lift, you've arm wrestled a few times,

1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:45.880
 trying to get better at it, trying to learn.

1:23:45.880 --> 1:23:49.480
 How would you advise getting better to where you can

1:23:49.480 --> 1:23:51.920
 beat your closest buddies?

1:23:51.920 --> 1:23:53.240
 That first step.

1:23:53.240 --> 1:23:56.680
 First step, I'd say find people.

1:23:56.680 --> 1:23:57.800
 Find people.

1:23:57.800 --> 1:23:58.980
 Find good people.

1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:01.480
 Volume.

1:24:01.480 --> 1:24:02.320
 Well, get with a club.

1:24:02.320 --> 1:24:03.520
 Get with people who know what they're doing,

1:24:03.520 --> 1:24:05.000
 who can mentor you.

1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:06.460
 And that's really cool.

1:24:06.460 --> 1:24:08.640
 I realized there's a club in Austin.

1:24:08.640 --> 1:24:09.480
 Yeah.

1:24:09.480 --> 1:24:10.300
 I'm sure there's in a lot of places.

1:24:10.300 --> 1:24:11.140
 Oh, they're everywhere.

1:24:11.140 --> 1:24:14.200
 We got this app called Armbet.

1:24:14.200 --> 1:24:15.040
 Yeah.

1:24:15.040 --> 1:24:18.040
 Which is a app that helps you find other people there.

1:24:18.040 --> 1:24:19.320
 Yeah, very easy.

1:24:19.320 --> 1:24:21.480
 But I mean, they're all over social networks.

1:24:21.480 --> 1:24:24.520
 I mean, it's kind of widespread now.

1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:26.680
 But yeah, find people.

1:24:26.680 --> 1:24:30.440
 Find people and it's just much easier to learn

1:24:30.440 --> 1:24:33.740
 with another person and you'll get stronger that way.

1:24:33.740 --> 1:24:36.360
 But I mean, do the lifts.

1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:39.580
 I mean, if you go to the gym, just start doing the lifts.

1:24:39.580 --> 1:24:42.960
 And right away, those will technically prepare you.

1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:44.400
 What are the lifts?

1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:45.240
 Can we describe what the first one is?

1:24:45.240 --> 1:24:48.160
 Yeah, so I'd say if you wanna just keep it

1:24:48.160 --> 1:24:50.840
 very, very simple, let's just talk about three.

1:24:50.840 --> 1:24:52.840
 There's much more than three.

1:24:52.840 --> 1:24:56.120
 But when you talk about energy allocation,

1:24:56.120 --> 1:24:58.680
 these three lifts, in my opinion,

1:24:58.680 --> 1:25:03.320
 should be like 90% of your investment.

1:25:03.320 --> 1:25:05.040
 It's very big, these three lifts.

1:25:06.920 --> 1:25:10.560
 And the exact percentages, you can argue about it,

1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:14.200
 but we'll start off with the cupping of the wrist.

1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:16.220
 Just this, it's a simple thing.

1:25:16.220 --> 1:25:17.880
 And do it with a cable.

1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:22.480
 You can get a thicker diameter, so it kind of

1:25:22.480 --> 1:25:25.000
 is more out on your fingers where an armrest

1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:26.320
 is gonna attack you.

1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:28.500
 Because any good armrest is gonna attack your fingers.

1:25:28.500 --> 1:25:30.080
 So like open hand.

1:25:30.080 --> 1:25:31.280
 No, no.

1:25:31.280 --> 1:25:33.880
 Well, I mean, for health, yes, you could.

1:25:33.880 --> 1:25:35.980
 But if you wanna be really specific,

1:25:35.980 --> 1:25:38.700
 you train exactly the way you would at a table.

1:25:38.700 --> 1:25:40.960
 In the position that you actually start that match.

1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:43.520
 Yeah, and then you're just doing this kind of thing.

1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:45.200
 Yes, to your center.

1:25:47.080 --> 1:25:50.320
 One of the big misconceptions in armwrestling

1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:52.760
 is that you're aiming for that pin pad.

1:25:53.860 --> 1:25:54.700
 No.

1:25:54.700 --> 1:25:56.140
 The center.

1:25:56.140 --> 1:25:56.980
 The chest up here.

1:25:56.980 --> 1:25:58.200
 Bring it close to you.

1:25:58.200 --> 1:25:59.760
 Make it come close to you, right?

1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:02.080
 You see like whenever I do my exercises,

1:26:02.080 --> 1:26:05.560
 the vector is always pulling straight towards me.

1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:06.400
 Yeah.

1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:10.040
 Yeah, so just cupping close to you.

1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:12.520
 The most dangerous thing that a person can do to me

1:26:12.520 --> 1:26:15.400
 on an armwrestling match is just pull me away from my body.

1:26:15.400 --> 1:26:17.440
 That's a terrible thing for me.

1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:22.440
 Yeah, so that cupping, that's a massive part of the sport.

1:26:23.820 --> 1:26:26.980
 So now when you think what does the cup do

1:26:26.980 --> 1:26:31.980
 to the other person, if I cup, they get turned over.

1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:33.160
 Right?

1:26:33.160 --> 1:26:35.120
 So this has to get really strong.

1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:37.680
 This pronation.

1:26:39.340 --> 1:26:42.960
 So to fight that rolling.

1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:44.280
 Exactly, yeah.

1:26:44.280 --> 1:26:47.240
 So that's through the thumb.

1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:48.080
 Yeah.

1:26:48.080 --> 1:26:51.080
 Oh, so you put, got it, you put on the thumb

1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:52.820
 and you put this motion.

1:26:52.820 --> 1:26:53.680
 Yeah.

1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:54.520
 Got it.

1:26:54.520 --> 1:26:55.340
 Yeah.

1:26:55.340 --> 1:26:57.240
 So those two things, those two things together,

1:26:57.240 --> 1:27:00.360
 this cupping and rolling, this is what's gonna make

1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:03.520
 the person's hand bend back, and once the person's hand

1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:07.960
 is bent back, just their whole game gets cut to pieces.

1:27:07.960 --> 1:27:09.880
 They have very little good options.

1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:12.140
 It's all like nasty stuff.

1:27:12.140 --> 1:27:12.980
 Wow.

1:27:12.980 --> 1:27:16.000
 Yeah, so those two things, that's a huge part

1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.040
 of your investment.

1:27:19.600 --> 1:27:20.440
 Rise.

1:27:21.680 --> 1:27:22.920
 Always be climbing.

1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:24.740
 Yeah, exactly.

1:27:24.740 --> 1:27:28.760
 Yeah, those three simple things, that's what I would tell

1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:31.200
 anybody to spend most of their time on if you wanna

1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:32.360
 become an art wrestler.

1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:35.660
 So bands would be good for this?

1:27:35.660 --> 1:27:37.960
 Bands are great because they're easy to transport.

1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:41.420
 The only problem I have with bands is like if you like

1:27:41.420 --> 1:27:43.740
 to measure, you know, and if you like to be precise,

1:27:43.740 --> 1:27:45.240
 bands just aren't that precise.

1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:46.760
 Right, so to have growth.

1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:47.600
 Yeah.

1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:50.000
 Just, I mean, it's just like, you know, you know exactly

1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.680
 what you need, the prescription is kind of, a band

1:27:52.680 --> 1:27:55.680
 is kind of like, and a lot of people, myself included,

1:27:55.680 --> 1:28:00.680
 I like to know exactly my outputs, so weights.

1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:04.200
 So would it be like cables?

1:28:04.200 --> 1:28:05.240
 Yep.

1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:06.120
 Cables are nice.

1:28:06.120 --> 1:28:07.120
 Bands are great, too.

1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:08.720
 I mix the two.

1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:13.720
 Bands are when I kind of don't need to, they're more

1:28:14.320 --> 1:28:15.760
 like easy for me.

1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:18.360
 When I train bands, bands are dangerous

1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:20.160
 because the acceleration is so high on them.

1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:22.000
 Like when you screw up with band training,

1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:25.320
 the acceleration is way faster than gravity, right?

1:28:25.320 --> 1:28:28.280
 So if you do something bad, it can make it go

1:28:28.280 --> 1:28:29.560
 really much worse.

1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:30.440
 Yeah.

1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:35.040
 It's funny that you didn't mention bicep curls or.

1:28:35.040 --> 1:28:36.700
 Well, it's a chain.

1:28:36.700 --> 1:28:37.540
 It's a chain.

1:28:37.540 --> 1:28:40.560
 And so you're, I mean, the idea if you focus on these three,

1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:43.360
 the other stuff catches up, like it's all involved.

1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:45.040
 This whole thing is involved.

1:28:45.040 --> 1:28:50.040
 So if you have an ax, right, the blade of the ax,

1:28:50.040 --> 1:28:54.220
 that's these things, right?

1:28:54.220 --> 1:28:57.420
 Like you need the pointy end of all your attacks

1:28:57.420 --> 1:28:59.500
 to be awesome, right?

1:28:59.500 --> 1:29:02.020
 If you have a super sharp ax, you could have

1:29:02.020 --> 1:29:03.540
 a shitty handle.

1:29:03.540 --> 1:29:05.100
 Yeah, right?

1:29:05.100 --> 1:29:08.860
 Yeah, so focus on that, the tip of the ax.

1:29:08.860 --> 1:29:11.140
 Yeah, the tip of the ax is so important, right?

1:29:11.140 --> 1:29:15.100
 Like if I have an awesome bicep and I can't quite use it,

1:29:15.100 --> 1:29:16.660
 what's it good for, right?

1:29:16.660 --> 1:29:19.060
 Yeah, I think a lot of the motions with the wrist

1:29:19.060 --> 1:29:22.420
 that you mentioned are, just thinking about jiu jitsu,

1:29:22.420 --> 1:29:25.940
 especially in the gi, there's a lot of,

1:29:25.940 --> 1:29:27.680
 I mean, there's so much importance to this,

1:29:27.680 --> 1:29:32.660
 and people don't often work it explicitly.

1:29:32.660 --> 1:29:35.420
 So many of the chokes require ability to,

1:29:35.420 --> 1:29:37.500
 it's almost like exactly like arm wrestling.

1:29:37.500 --> 1:29:38.340
 Very close.

1:29:38.340 --> 1:29:41.020
 Because you're weak here, what's that called,

1:29:41.020 --> 1:29:45.460
 flop wrist, and you're strong with the cup, yeah.

1:29:45.460 --> 1:29:49.740
 And so just getting the, whatever that's involved,

1:29:49.740 --> 1:29:51.380
 the muscle, the turning, the pressure,

1:29:51.380 --> 1:29:54.140
 because that's where also the choke comes.

1:29:54.140 --> 1:29:57.740
 That little, the thing that makes you win in arm wrestling

1:29:57.740 --> 1:30:00.340
 is also the thing that finishes the person

1:30:00.340 --> 1:30:02.180
 when you have them grabbed.

1:30:02.180 --> 1:30:03.740
 The strength is very similar.

1:30:03.740 --> 1:30:05.500
 Yeah, it's fascinating, actually.

1:30:05.500 --> 1:30:08.300
 Of course, like you said, if you wanna be very good,

1:30:08.300 --> 1:30:12.060
 you should be doing the very specific exact motion.

1:30:12.060 --> 1:30:13.660
 Yeah, so if I was gonna do jiu jitsu,

1:30:13.660 --> 1:30:15.620
 I'd be like working out with the gi.

1:30:15.620 --> 1:30:18.540
 Yeah, the problem is, you know,

1:30:18.540 --> 1:30:23.540
 it's difficult to construct the exact,

1:30:24.100 --> 1:30:25.700
 so you have to actually go with people,

1:30:25.700 --> 1:30:28.980
 and then they don't like being choked on, right?

1:30:28.980 --> 1:30:31.660
 So like it's hard to, I'm actually a big,

1:30:31.660 --> 1:30:33.820
 we have these kinds of debates all the time,

1:30:33.820 --> 1:30:38.460
 is, you know, I'm a big believer in drilling.

1:30:38.460 --> 1:30:40.780
 I love doing something thousands of times.

1:30:40.780 --> 1:30:43.580
 Like John Donahoe is somebody I mentioned to you about

1:30:43.580 --> 1:30:46.020
 who, the jiu jitsu folks here,

1:30:46.020 --> 1:30:48.020
 they're less believers in drilling.

1:30:48.020 --> 1:30:52.300
 They see the value of almost like the mind

1:30:52.300 --> 1:30:55.420
 of going live and exploring ideas.

1:30:55.420 --> 1:30:56.620
 It's that play.

1:30:56.620 --> 1:30:58.980
 You don't need to do the thing a thousand times.

1:30:58.980 --> 1:31:02.020
 You just need to always be thinking about

1:31:02.020 --> 1:31:05.260
 the little details that make you better,

1:31:05.260 --> 1:31:07.340
 and then in action practicing,

1:31:07.340 --> 1:31:09.980
 like developing the strength, the power,

1:31:09.980 --> 1:31:12.420
 the explosive of the agility in action.

1:31:12.420 --> 1:31:14.100
 So actually rolling.

1:31:14.100 --> 1:31:16.900
 I don't, you know, I agree with this,

1:31:16.900 --> 1:31:20.100
 but I just believe in volume more.

1:31:20.100 --> 1:31:22.180
 Yeah, so you can accomplish it through volume.

1:31:22.180 --> 1:31:24.780
 You can play a lot.

1:31:24.780 --> 1:31:25.740
 Yes, exactly.

1:31:25.740 --> 1:31:28.460
 Well, that's the, if you really wanna get it good

1:31:28.460 --> 1:31:30.780
 is you're talking about, I mean,

1:31:30.780 --> 1:31:33.660
 that's why a lot of these folks are training

1:31:33.660 --> 1:31:34.500
 three times a day.

1:31:34.500 --> 1:31:37.020
 They're doing, you know, they're putting in the hours,

1:31:37.020 --> 1:31:40.140
 eight hours, nine hours, just.

1:31:40.140 --> 1:31:41.900
 Well, that's tough, oh my God.

1:31:41.900 --> 1:31:44.060
 Well, so there are a lot of them are not going hard.

1:31:44.060 --> 1:31:45.420
 It's just being on the mat.

1:31:45.420 --> 1:31:48.020
 Some of it is just sitting there talking through ideas,

1:31:48.020 --> 1:31:50.780
 watching others or teaching, explaining stuff.

1:31:50.780 --> 1:31:53.820
 It's just, it's like, it's not just physical.

1:31:53.820 --> 1:31:56.860
 It's mental too, because you're keeping in your mind.

1:31:56.860 --> 1:32:01.300
 And some of the greatest, they talk about the wrestlers

1:32:01.300 --> 1:32:05.740
 I've talked with, the fighters, at the top of their career,

1:32:05.740 --> 1:32:10.340
 they basically, George St. Pierre is like this,

1:32:10.340 --> 1:32:14.260
 another fellow Canadian, is like,

1:32:14.260 --> 1:32:17.340
 has stick figures in his head that he can't help.

1:32:17.340 --> 1:32:20.860
 They're like in there, because if you train enough hours,

1:32:20.860 --> 1:32:23.420
 you're, it's just gonna be in your head

1:32:23.420 --> 1:32:25.780
 and they're all going to be playing around in your head.

1:32:25.780 --> 1:32:27.860
 And some little detail over time,

1:32:27.860 --> 1:32:29.740
 it's almost like computing or something like that.

1:32:29.740 --> 1:32:32.540
 And that ends up having a result

1:32:32.540 --> 1:32:34.740
 even though you're not physically doing anything.

1:32:34.740 --> 1:32:36.700
 It's always in there.

1:32:36.700 --> 1:32:41.280
 I do have to return to diet real quick.

1:32:41.280 --> 1:32:42.840
 I know we talk about pancakes.

1:32:42.840 --> 1:32:47.840
 Let me, quite seriously, you are one of the,

1:32:49.180 --> 1:32:54.140
 I mean, strongest athletes in the world for your sport.

1:32:54.140 --> 1:32:56.360
 So you have to get big, you have to get powerful,

1:32:56.360 --> 1:32:57.760
 you have to get strong.

1:32:59.100 --> 1:33:02.060
 What is the right diet for you for that?

1:33:02.060 --> 1:33:04.380
 Like, what do you eat?

1:33:04.380 --> 1:33:09.380
 How often do you eat, yeah, from the highest detail

1:33:10.500 --> 1:33:12.860
 to the smallest, or the things that make you happy

1:33:12.860 --> 1:33:13.780
 and feel good?

1:33:13.780 --> 1:33:17.820
 Yeah, I've experimented with every diet.

1:33:17.820 --> 1:33:22.080
 I've done it all, I've been a vegan, I've done raw,

1:33:22.080 --> 1:33:26.220
 I've eaten only meat, I've eaten balanced,

1:33:26.220 --> 1:33:31.140
 I've eaten like a bodybuilder, you know, you name it,

1:33:31.140 --> 1:33:36.140
 I've probably tried it, I don't believe

1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:40.360
 that it's as important in the sport of arm wrestling

1:33:40.360 --> 1:33:42.540
 as it is perhaps in other sports.

1:33:43.540 --> 1:33:47.380
 I believe that, I mean, just to be very basic,

1:33:47.380 --> 1:33:49.160
 I mean, if you're eating enough food,

1:33:49.160 --> 1:33:50.660
 you're probably gonna be okay.

1:33:52.560 --> 1:33:54.060
 So it's just calories.

1:33:54.060 --> 1:33:57.020
 I mean, really, I mean, not to overcomplicate it,

1:33:57.020 --> 1:33:59.060
 but I mean, that's where the conversation starts

1:33:59.060 --> 1:34:01.620
 where you're eating enough food.

1:34:01.620 --> 1:34:04.580
 And it can come in any number of ways,

1:34:04.580 --> 1:34:08.420
 and I don't think it's as important

1:34:08.420 --> 1:34:11.140
 as a lot of other people do.

1:34:11.140 --> 1:34:13.680
 I'm certainly irresponsible in a lot,

1:34:13.680 --> 1:34:17.420
 but the thing is, back to like, volume, right?

1:34:17.420 --> 1:34:20.140
 Like, you need to, like, if you wanna be

1:34:20.140 --> 1:34:23.720
 a super heavyweight, it's very different

1:34:23.720 --> 1:34:26.060
 than if you wanna be a weight category guy.

1:34:26.060 --> 1:34:27.780
 If you wanna be a weight category guy,

1:34:27.780 --> 1:34:30.180
 I'd say that you need to be more responsible,

1:34:30.180 --> 1:34:32.020
 make better choices.

1:34:32.020 --> 1:34:36.100
 If you wanna be a super heavyweight, everything.

1:34:36.100 --> 1:34:38.340
 Just so we're watching a delicious looking omelet,

1:34:38.340 --> 1:34:42.180
 so eggs, bacon, syrup, so you don't care, carbs.

1:34:42.180 --> 1:34:46.460
 So in all the things you try, so I mostly eat meat now.

1:34:46.460 --> 1:34:50.060
 And I landed on that, there's several things,

1:34:50.060 --> 1:34:53.420
 obviously I'm not, but I do a lot of sport.

1:34:53.420 --> 1:34:55.660
 And I was very surprised how my particular,

1:34:55.660 --> 1:35:00.620
 very specific body could perform better with only meat.

1:35:00.620 --> 1:35:01.500
 Why better?

1:35:01.500 --> 1:35:03.300
 The sports I do, the mind matters.

1:35:03.300 --> 1:35:06.180
 And so for some reason, my mind's just clear.

1:35:06.180 --> 1:35:09.020
 And I don't think, because it feels unhealthy.

1:35:09.020 --> 1:35:10.820
 It just makes me feel really good.

1:35:10.820 --> 1:35:13.740
 I don't think I would recommend it to anybody else.

1:35:13.740 --> 1:35:18.740
 So it's interesting that that journey of just exploring

1:35:19.500 --> 1:35:22.960
 can take you to figure out something about your own self.

1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:25.620
 One of the most interesting things that I heard about

1:35:25.620 --> 1:35:29.140
 nutrition was, I heard there was a.

1:35:29.140 --> 1:35:31.220
 Actually, Doritos, I forgot about that.

1:35:31.220 --> 1:35:33.100
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm an idiot.

1:35:35.100 --> 1:35:38.100
 Now, I'd say over the last couple of years,

1:35:38.100 --> 1:35:42.060
 I've really gone into carbs a lot and high glycemic carbs.

1:35:42.060 --> 1:35:44.580
 And just to, I feel like it's one of the best things

1:35:44.580 --> 1:35:45.980
 you can do if you're working out really hard.

1:35:45.980 --> 1:35:48.620
 Just add carbs, yeah, exactly.

1:35:48.620 --> 1:35:53.620
 But, oh, where was I?

1:35:55.180 --> 1:35:59.980
 So you've added, syrup is so delicious it's distracting.

1:35:59.980 --> 1:36:03.540
 No, so you've added the high glycemic carbs into the mix.

1:36:03.540 --> 1:36:06.580
 So those help, but that's for mass building.

1:36:06.580 --> 1:36:10.140
 Right, so there was a study that I heard about

1:36:10.140 --> 1:36:12.940
 by somebody who was trying to identify heart attacks.

1:36:12.940 --> 1:36:14.640
 They did this great big study.

1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:17.100
 And at the end of it, I mean, didn't matter

1:36:17.100 --> 1:36:20.820
 what the people ate, the most important thing

1:36:20.820 --> 1:36:23.700
 was how they felt about the food that they were eating.

1:36:23.700 --> 1:36:27.580
 Yeah, so if you believe in the food,

1:36:27.580 --> 1:36:30.660
 if you believe that it's gonna do good things for you,

1:36:30.660 --> 1:36:32.820
 if you allocate it the right way,

1:36:32.820 --> 1:36:35.420
 it's gonna have a positive impact.

1:36:35.420 --> 1:36:37.400
 And I try and do that no matter what it is.

1:36:37.400 --> 1:36:40.140
 Like I have my foods that I think do certain things.

1:36:40.140 --> 1:36:44.980
 And so, you know, for me, I know that,

1:36:44.980 --> 1:36:48.300
 actually, I mean, I learned about corn fed pumps

1:36:48.300 --> 1:36:49.920
 when I was overseas.

1:36:50.900 --> 1:36:55.380
 I realized that I never used to eat crap, really didn't.

1:36:55.380 --> 1:36:57.700
 I ate super clean all the time.

1:36:58.580 --> 1:37:03.580
 And when I was faced with imminent death more,

1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:07.940
 I would be like, okay, I'm going out tonight,

1:37:07.940 --> 1:37:10.640
 let's have a couple ice cream bars.

1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:12.100
 You know, like whatever.

1:37:12.100 --> 1:37:17.100
 And what I realized is if I eat like an entire bag of chips

1:37:18.820 --> 1:37:21.720
 or like, you know, a bunch of chocolate bars,

1:37:22.860 --> 1:37:25.020
 and then I go and have a workout,

1:37:25.020 --> 1:37:27.460
 my workout will be incredible.

1:37:27.460 --> 1:37:28.660
 It'll be incredible.

1:37:30.300 --> 1:37:35.220
 There's something about easily processed carbohydrates

1:37:35.220 --> 1:37:40.220
 that will continue to quickly get into your blood

1:37:40.220 --> 1:37:42.860
 as fast as you can burn it.

1:37:42.860 --> 1:37:45.620
 And there's something about that

1:37:45.620 --> 1:37:50.620
 that will give you incredible blood flow, yeah.

1:37:51.420 --> 1:37:54.060
 And also your mind plugging in, enjoying that.

1:37:54.060 --> 1:37:54.900
 Right.

1:37:54.900 --> 1:37:56.380
 And then believing it works,

1:37:56.380 --> 1:37:58.600
 and that's how it makes it work better.

1:37:58.600 --> 1:37:59.440
 Exactly.

1:37:59.440 --> 1:38:01.160
 I mean, I feel that way.

1:38:01.160 --> 1:38:03.280
 I think this is really not,

1:38:03.280 --> 1:38:04.700
 this has been frustrating to me

1:38:04.700 --> 1:38:07.260
 about the health culture in the United States

1:38:07.260 --> 1:38:09.900
 in the studies that are done.

1:38:09.900 --> 1:38:12.140
 You know, you look at like the importance of sleep,

1:38:12.140 --> 1:38:16.060
 the importance of X diet, all those kinds of things.

1:38:16.060 --> 1:38:19.380
 I wish incorporated into that would be

1:38:19.380 --> 1:38:22.460
 your mental relationship with all of these things.

1:38:22.460 --> 1:38:23.980
 So for example, people that tell me,

1:38:23.980 --> 1:38:26.500
 well, your sleep schedule is insane.

1:38:26.500 --> 1:38:28.860
 Yes, perhaps.

1:38:28.860 --> 1:38:32.660
 But also, it's insane because I'm doing what I love

1:38:32.660 --> 1:38:34.340
 and I don't see it as a problem.

1:38:34.340 --> 1:38:35.180
 Right.

1:38:35.180 --> 1:38:38.740
 And I think that's really important to understand.

1:38:38.740 --> 1:38:43.180
 If you sleeping crazy hours

1:38:45.180 --> 1:38:47.020
 is not affecting your stress

1:38:47.020 --> 1:38:48.980
 and is actually making you happy

1:38:48.980 --> 1:38:51.940
 or you're drawing some kind of source of happiness

1:38:51.940 --> 1:38:53.100
 and pleasure and satisfaction,

1:38:53.100 --> 1:38:54.900
 like being awake when others aren't.

1:38:54.900 --> 1:38:57.560
 It's like the Mike Tyson thing or something,

1:38:57.560 --> 1:39:00.200
 like training when you've convinced yourself

1:39:00.200 --> 1:39:01.680
 everybody's sleeping and therefore

1:39:01.680 --> 1:39:04.140
 you're somehow training much better.

1:39:04.140 --> 1:39:07.780
 That's powerful even if you look statistically

1:39:07.780 --> 1:39:10.120
 six hours may be worse than eight hours

1:39:10.120 --> 1:39:12.340
 or four hours may be worse than six hours.

1:39:12.340 --> 1:39:14.500
 So the mind is a powerful thing.

1:39:14.500 --> 1:39:16.240
 Super powerful.

1:39:16.240 --> 1:39:18.080
 But if you want to be a super heavyweight.

1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:19.500
 Eat.

1:39:19.500 --> 1:39:23.360
 You got to eat like stupid amounts all the time, yeah.

1:39:23.360 --> 1:39:25.360
 You have to test your digestive system.

1:39:25.360 --> 1:39:26.580
 What's your favorite meal by the way?

1:39:26.580 --> 1:39:29.780
 Just if you had to, you know, your last meal.

1:39:29.780 --> 1:39:34.780
 I am, I do, oh geez, I like so much food, it's tough.

1:39:34.900 --> 1:39:37.740
 But I'd say the food that I rely on a lot

1:39:37.740 --> 1:39:41.020
 when I'm getting ready to compete is sushi.

1:39:41.020 --> 1:39:42.260
 Just because it normally comes in

1:39:42.260 --> 1:39:45.580
 an all you can eat format, you know.

1:39:45.580 --> 1:39:50.580
 So I love to go and just binge all you can eat buffets.

1:39:50.720 --> 1:39:52.460
 Sushi is just super convenient.

1:39:52.460 --> 1:39:53.740
 Yeah.

1:39:53.740 --> 1:39:56.180
 If I was a sushi all you can eat buffet place

1:39:56.180 --> 1:39:57.780
 I'd be terrified when I saw you.

1:39:58.960 --> 1:40:01.060
 Have you had barbecue at Texas?

1:40:01.060 --> 1:40:03.620
 Yeah, I love it, I love it, yeah.

1:40:03.620 --> 1:40:06.060
 So you, just a small tangent on this.

1:40:06.060 --> 1:40:10.980
 You faced The Mountain for Bjornsson.

1:40:10.980 --> 1:40:12.380
 Well first of all you arm wrestled him.

1:40:12.380 --> 1:40:15.340
 It's interesting to ask, so this is The Mountain

1:40:15.340 --> 1:40:18.580
 from the Game of Thrones, a strong man,

1:40:18.580 --> 1:40:19.980
 one of the strongest people in the world,

1:40:19.980 --> 1:40:22.020
 for a time the strongest person in the world.

1:40:22.020 --> 1:40:24.940
 What was it like, I know sort of you guys

1:40:24.940 --> 1:40:28.500
 maybe weren't going 1,000%, but what's it like?

1:40:28.500 --> 1:40:30.860
 Well he probably wasn't going 1,000%.

1:40:30.860 --> 1:40:31.940
 Yeah.

1:40:31.940 --> 1:40:34.060
 But like what, it's interesting to think

1:40:34.060 --> 1:40:36.840
 what does that strength feel like?

1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:41.140
 So it's a specialized strength in another sport.

1:40:41.140 --> 1:40:41.980
 Yeah.

1:40:41.980 --> 1:40:42.880
 What did it feel like?

1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:46.920
 What, how strong was he, what are some kind

1:40:46.920 --> 1:40:50.660
 of deep insights you've drawn from that battle?

1:40:50.660 --> 1:40:55.320
 I feel like if we were to go back 1,000 years

1:40:56.400 --> 1:41:00.400
 and if you give him armor and a two handed sword

1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:04.220
 he will just rip across the landscape.

1:41:04.220 --> 1:41:06.520
 And no one will stop him.

1:41:06.520 --> 1:41:08.120
 So this is the boxing match you came to,

1:41:08.120 --> 1:41:10.820
 but there's also a video of them arm wrestling.

1:41:12.320 --> 1:41:15.280
 Yeah, what a titan though, what a titan.

1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:20.280
 A guy like that, tall, strong, fit, disciplined.

1:41:21.400 --> 1:41:24.160
 I mean he is quite a warrior.

1:41:24.160 --> 1:41:25.960
 419 pounds?

1:41:25.960 --> 1:41:29.820
 Yeah, yeah, he's incredibly impressive.

1:41:29.820 --> 1:41:34.200
 I really like Hap Thor and I like Eddie Hall too.

1:41:34.200 --> 1:41:38.560
 And I was just so, I'm just so caught up with the drama.

1:41:38.560 --> 1:41:42.880
 Okay, so Eddie Hall and Hap Thor Bjornsson,

1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:46.440
 two of the strongest legendary strongmen that we have.

1:41:48.200 --> 1:41:50.320
 And they were the coolest, they were the top

1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:52.540
 when strongman was really super cool.

1:41:54.540 --> 1:41:56.680
 I don't know all the details,

1:41:56.680 --> 1:41:58.440
 but they legit hit each other.

1:41:58.440 --> 1:42:00.520
 Like legit.

1:42:00.520 --> 1:42:03.200
 So I think it kind of stems, I don't know,

1:42:03.200 --> 1:42:05.480
 like I say, I'm not right there with them,

1:42:05.480 --> 1:42:10.480
 but Eddie won the World's Strongest Man event

1:42:11.380 --> 1:42:13.720
 or something one year and the thing is,

1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:17.680
 one of those victories where Hap Thor

1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:20.080
 was not accepting of his defeat.

1:42:20.080 --> 1:42:22.000
 Okay, and there was a little bit of back and forth.

1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:23.120
 And basically from what I understand,

1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:25.060
 they were gonna fight the knight

1:42:25.060 --> 1:42:27.200
 of the World's Strongest Man.

1:42:27.200 --> 1:42:29.160
 And they kind of got pulled apart

1:42:29.160 --> 1:42:33.440
 and this heat between them got translated

1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:35.640
 into a potential boxing match.

1:42:35.640 --> 1:42:37.120
 So it's very real.

1:42:37.120 --> 1:42:38.240
 It's a very real fight.

1:42:38.240 --> 1:42:41.520
 So you have the two strongest dudes on the planet

1:42:41.520 --> 1:42:43.440
 are gonna fight each other.

1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:45.340
 So I've been like, you know,

1:42:45.340 --> 1:42:46.980
 because arm wrestling and strongman,

1:42:46.980 --> 1:42:48.640
 it's kind of similar communities.

1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:50.520
 Who do you got?

1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:53.840
 If you were giving me financial advice

1:42:53.840 --> 1:42:55.320
 in the middle of the fight.

1:42:55.320 --> 1:42:57.760
 I am so bad, I always call it wrong.

1:42:57.760 --> 1:42:59.520
 They're very different.

1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:03.680
 I see Hap Thor as being, you know, more.

1:43:03.680 --> 1:43:06.320
 Eddie Hall slimming down, is that what you mean as well?

1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:08.820
 I see Hap Thor as a bit more regimented,

1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:13.760
 but I see Eddie Hall as like way more barbaric

1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:17.720
 and like, I think he's a little bit more athletic,

1:43:17.720 --> 1:43:21.160
 but Hap Thor is bigger and, you know,

1:43:21.160 --> 1:43:22.880
 they've chosen slightly different paths

1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:24.280
 to prepare for the match.

1:43:24.280 --> 1:43:27.340
 But what happened was like, they were about to fight

1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:30.040
 and Eddie Hall blew his bicep.

1:43:31.080 --> 1:43:34.280
 So me, I was getting ready for Levan in December.

1:43:34.280 --> 1:43:36.240
 We were supposed to arm wrestle in December,

1:43:36.240 --> 1:43:38.620
 but he's got his movie.

1:43:38.620 --> 1:43:40.660
 And so I was like, okay, I can kind of get away

1:43:40.660 --> 1:43:43.620
 from the sport just a little bit, broaden my base.

1:43:43.620 --> 1:43:47.120
 That happened and I was like, ah, an opportunity.

1:43:47.120 --> 1:43:48.000
 You stepped in.

1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:49.400
 An opportunity to fight.

1:43:49.400 --> 1:43:50.880
 I'm like, I'll do it, so.

1:43:50.880 --> 1:43:54.080
 How much training, you trained a little bit,

1:43:54.080 --> 1:43:56.740
 so can you tell about your own decision to do that?

1:43:56.740 --> 1:43:57.680
 What was the training like?

1:43:57.680 --> 1:43:58.720
 What was the experience like?

1:43:58.720 --> 1:44:00.000
 Oh, it was so much fun.

1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:01.660
 It was so much fun.

1:44:02.680 --> 1:44:05.560
 So basically, I made a funny video

1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:08.680
 and I sent it to the organizers of Core Sports

1:44:08.680 --> 1:44:09.720
 that I would do it.

1:44:09.720 --> 1:44:10.560
 I'm like, I'll do it.

1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:13.840
 I'm sure they got a thousand people who wanted to do it.

1:44:13.840 --> 1:44:16.920
 But I'm like, listen, I'm an old man.

1:44:16.920 --> 1:44:18.960
 Like I'm gimped up like everywhere

1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:20.520
 outside the arm wrestling lanes.

1:44:21.400 --> 1:44:23.600
 I said, but I will 100%.

1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:26.620
 Like if you let me fight them, I'll give it my all.

1:44:26.620 --> 1:44:29.520
 And whatever, they didn't get back to me.

1:44:29.520 --> 1:44:30.600
 They're like, yeah, whatever, okay.

1:44:30.600 --> 1:44:33.500
 So then they call me on a Friday,

1:44:33.500 --> 1:44:37.000
 like five weeks before the event,

1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:39.960
 and they're like, hey, Devin, were you serious?

1:44:39.960 --> 1:44:41.200
 And I'm like, oh, shit.

1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:46.200
 And I'm like, yes, I was serious.

1:44:46.480 --> 1:44:47.560
 Yeah, I'll do it.

1:44:47.560 --> 1:44:51.160
 And they're like, okay, they're like,

1:44:51.160 --> 1:44:54.400
 it's down to you and like two other people

1:44:54.400 --> 1:44:56.280
 we'll get back to you in a day or two,

1:44:56.280 --> 1:44:57.440
 but you would do it.

1:44:57.440 --> 1:44:58.280
 And I'm like, okay.

1:44:58.280 --> 1:45:01.200
 So they got back to me on Sunday, like,

1:45:01.200 --> 1:45:03.180
 so right away I'm like skipping rope.

1:45:03.180 --> 1:45:06.560
 And I'm like, and I'm so, I only arm wrestle legs.

1:45:06.560 --> 1:45:07.640
 That's all I do.

1:45:07.640 --> 1:45:10.560
 So what was your, you did some striking training.

1:45:10.560 --> 1:45:14.520
 Yeah, so I went to this guy that he was awesome,

1:45:14.520 --> 1:45:19.520
 Zach, Ben Bushida there, that was it from TriStar.

1:45:19.520 --> 1:45:22.320
 Do you know for us the hobby and that's.

1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:23.920
 And yes, people in the comments,

1:45:23.920 --> 1:45:26.640
 I will interview him on this podcast and people can.

1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:28.280
 He's brilliant, right?

1:45:28.280 --> 1:45:29.680
 He's an incredible guy.

1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:31.400
 So right away, like I had no idea

1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:33.840
 about the fight community across Canada really.

1:45:33.840 --> 1:45:37.240
 And I got like by the fifth message

1:45:37.240 --> 1:45:40.320
 that said you must train with Feras.

1:45:40.320 --> 1:45:42.200
 I was like, okay, called him up.

1:45:42.200 --> 1:45:43.440
 He was incredible right away.

1:45:43.440 --> 1:45:46.080
 He's like, yeah, you can come and we'll just work with you.

1:45:46.080 --> 1:45:50.440
 So I got, I got the call, I called him on like Monday

1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:53.240
 at two oclock by like seven oclock.

1:45:53.240 --> 1:45:56.440
 I had my things packed and I went to Montreal

1:45:56.440 --> 1:46:00.120
 and I spent four weeks in the fighter dorms.

1:46:00.120 --> 1:46:01.240
 Just humbling yourself.

1:46:01.240 --> 1:46:05.000
 Yeah, every day, just getting punched in the face,

1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:10.000
 you know, over and over going for runs with all,

1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:12.080
 like they're all like Olympians and pro fighters

1:46:12.080 --> 1:46:13.920
 living in the dorms, super cool dudes.

1:46:13.920 --> 1:46:15.160
 They were so good to me.

1:46:15.160 --> 1:46:19.160
 Yeah, there's a good video of you and Feras just talking.

1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:21.560
 Yeah, I don't remember which stage this was,

1:46:21.560 --> 1:46:24.560
 but basically, but you were already beginning

1:46:24.560 --> 1:46:25.400
 to get humbled.

1:46:25.400 --> 1:46:26.640
 Oh man, I knew.

1:46:26.640 --> 1:46:28.600
 I mean, I knew what I was getting into.

1:46:28.600 --> 1:46:31.960
 Like I knew it was, I knew it was gonna be a losing battle,

1:46:31.960 --> 1:46:35.280
 but I felt like the opportunity to fight Thor,

1:46:35.280 --> 1:46:37.080
 like how cool is that?

1:46:37.080 --> 1:46:40.360
 Like I had to say, I had to do it.

1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:45.360
 I loved the process and I learned a lot from doing it.

1:46:46.560 --> 1:46:49.240
 Like the dorms, I wanna do something like that

1:46:49.240 --> 1:46:50.080
 with arm wrestling.

1:46:50.080 --> 1:46:52.480
 I think we're big enough now that we can have these

1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:55.800
 kind of, you know, dorms, frat houses,

1:46:55.800 --> 1:46:56.840
 whatever you wanna call it.

1:46:56.840 --> 1:46:57.880
 What's the dorm like?

1:46:57.880 --> 1:47:00.680
 So you're basically staying there, food's there.

1:47:00.680 --> 1:47:03.720
 So you mentioned, what was the word you used?

1:47:03.720 --> 1:47:04.560
 Administration.

1:47:04.560 --> 1:47:06.240
 Yeah, exactly, that's it.

1:47:06.240 --> 1:47:07.440
 So it removes all of that.

1:47:07.440 --> 1:47:08.440
 Makes it so simple.

1:47:08.440 --> 1:47:09.280
 You can just focus.

1:47:09.280 --> 1:47:12.040
 You know, the gym is here, you live here.

1:47:12.040 --> 1:47:12.880
 Yeah.

1:47:12.880 --> 1:47:15.600
 You know, that your life becomes simple.

1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:16.800
 Yeah.

1:47:16.800 --> 1:47:18.960
 So there's a guy named Jimmy Pedro here in America.

1:47:18.960 --> 1:47:21.680
 He's a famous coach, has a place up in Boston.

1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:23.240
 He has kind of a dorm like that too.

1:47:23.240 --> 1:47:24.080
 Yeah.

1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:28.720
 And that becomes essential when the community is small,

1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:32.720
 but you're trying to do epic things like win an Olympic gold.

1:47:32.720 --> 1:47:33.560
 Yeah.

1:47:33.560 --> 1:47:35.920
 So you have to really put the people together

1:47:35.920 --> 1:47:37.760
 in these kind of minimalist conditions

1:47:37.760 --> 1:47:39.280
 where they just focus on the training,

1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:40.480
 focus, focus, focus.

1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:41.320
 Yes.

1:47:42.240 --> 1:47:43.840
 Yeah, it wasn't enough time.

1:47:43.840 --> 1:47:46.760
 I mean, I trained for about three or four weeks,

1:47:47.760 --> 1:47:50.480
 but I loved the journey and...

1:47:50.480 --> 1:47:52.040
 Well, what are some of the fun things you enjoy?

1:47:52.040 --> 1:47:54.320
 So you did mostly striking, did you?

1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:55.160
 Yeah, I guess it was...

1:47:55.160 --> 1:47:56.000
 Yeah, it was boxing.

1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:56.840
 It was straight up boxing.

1:47:56.840 --> 1:47:58.000
 Boxing, yeah.

1:47:58.000 --> 1:47:59.920
 What are some things that were transferable?

1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:02.320
 What are some cool things you learned from that?

1:48:02.320 --> 1:48:03.760
 So from the world of armwrestling,

1:48:03.760 --> 1:48:05.240
 have you taken anything back?

1:48:05.240 --> 1:48:09.000
 Like some training regimens, ideas about training,

1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:11.240
 even movements?

1:48:12.840 --> 1:48:17.400
 Because for us it's a unique mind as well for training.

1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:18.400
 Yeah.

1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:19.600
 I don't know.

1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:23.880
 I mean, I've gone very far down the path of armwrestling.

1:48:24.920 --> 1:48:27.840
 Boxing and armwrestling are very different.

1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:30.080
 They're very different sports.

1:48:30.080 --> 1:48:35.080
 The physicality required is very different.

1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:39.000
 The mentality, I mean, it's fighting.

1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:41.120
 So it's another form of fighting, which is cool.

1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:44.360
 The big things that I took back from it,

1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:47.880
 the things that I loved about it was I had to run again.

1:48:49.600 --> 1:48:51.160
 So really work on endurance.

1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:52.240
 Yeah.

1:48:52.240 --> 1:48:54.480
 Yeah, I was going for runs with guys in the dorms

1:48:54.480 --> 1:48:57.920
 and they would just destroy me.

1:48:57.920 --> 1:49:00.920
 Just like it was so bad.

1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:06.280
 How did you feel in the actual boxing

1:49:06.280 --> 1:49:08.400
 in terms of endurance?

1:49:08.400 --> 1:49:09.240
 Were you able to?

1:49:09.240 --> 1:49:10.080
 No.

1:49:10.080 --> 1:49:11.160
 No.

1:49:11.160 --> 1:49:12.000
 It's just torture.

1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:14.000
 It was terrible.

1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.320
 And the thing is it was so crazy for me

1:49:16.320 --> 1:49:19.680
 because I really was good once upon a time.

1:49:19.680 --> 1:49:20.520
 I really was.

1:49:20.520 --> 1:49:24.520
 Like physically, I had incredible full body endurance.

1:49:24.520 --> 1:49:29.520
 But being so specialized, I realized how much I had slipped.

1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:33.560
 And yeah, it was fun to try and regain it.

1:49:33.560 --> 1:49:36.200
 I think it's affected my body composition.

1:49:36.200 --> 1:49:39.200
 I think since that training, I've become much more lean.

1:49:39.200 --> 1:49:42.480
 I think it was a very healthy thing for me to do.

1:49:42.480 --> 1:49:46.080
 Like health wise, I always think that when you're far away

1:49:46.080 --> 1:49:48.920
 from competition, it's really good to kind of spread out.

1:49:48.920 --> 1:49:49.760
 Really good.

1:49:49.760 --> 1:49:51.120
 So I think that in that way.

1:49:51.120 --> 1:49:52.120
 Also for your mind.

1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:52.960
 Yeah.

1:49:52.960 --> 1:49:56.880
 Yeah, just like, yeah.

1:49:56.880 --> 1:49:59.560
 Yeah, it's something about clearing your,

1:50:00.720 --> 1:50:02.760
 I think you've talked about this is like

1:50:03.640 --> 1:50:06.360
 you're basically taking steps back

1:50:06.360 --> 1:50:08.000
 before you take steps forward.

1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:08.840
 I forget how you call it.

1:50:08.840 --> 1:50:09.760
 Yeah, the wave.

1:50:09.760 --> 1:50:10.600
 Yeah.

1:50:10.600 --> 1:50:13.200
 Yeah, under, you know, you have to go under.

1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:14.640
 You got to.

1:50:14.640 --> 1:50:16.280
 You know, if you want to go above the line,

1:50:16.280 --> 1:50:18.560
 you have to spend some time beneath it.

1:50:18.560 --> 1:50:20.280
 And yeah, I was definitely beneath the line

1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:21.120
 for a long time.

1:50:21.120 --> 1:50:22.560
 Yeah.

1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:26.840
 But Mountain, I mean, like the interesting thing was

1:50:26.840 --> 1:50:31.840
 as incredible as he is, you know, like what a monster.

1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:37.240
 And I think if you had had him training in boxing,

1:50:37.240 --> 1:50:40.160
 you know, for a long time and like from his youth,

1:50:40.160 --> 1:50:42.920
 I think you, you know, the guy could be world champion,

1:50:42.920 --> 1:50:46.440
 but you know, to be so specialized and then to switch,

1:50:46.440 --> 1:50:47.640
 you're at a disadvantage.

1:50:47.640 --> 1:50:48.480
 Yeah.

1:50:48.480 --> 1:50:53.480
 And also like I know from just fighting guys in the gym

1:50:53.920 --> 1:50:58.640
 in TriStar, some of those guys were way scarier, for real.

1:50:58.640 --> 1:51:01.920
 Like as scary as Thor is, like there's guys

1:51:01.920 --> 1:51:05.760
 in that TriStar gym that don't look like anything

1:51:05.760 --> 1:51:10.280
 that would murder me much worse, much worse.

1:51:10.280 --> 1:51:12.600
 Yeah, but also, you know, that's the difference

1:51:12.600 --> 1:51:15.040
 between being in the gym and under the lights too.

1:51:15.040 --> 1:51:18.320
 I mean, GSB is an example, George St. Pierre is an example,

1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:21.760
 somebody that maybe doesn't look terrifying.

1:51:21.760 --> 1:51:22.600
 He's at a TriStar.

1:51:22.600 --> 1:51:25.400
 Yep, he trains at TriStar, but he's quite,

1:51:25.400 --> 1:51:29.160
 he's super nice, super humble,

1:51:29.160 --> 1:51:31.240
 but is terrifying when he's fighting.

1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:32.080
 Right.

1:51:32.080 --> 1:51:33.560
 He's dominating people.

1:51:33.560 --> 1:51:38.560
 You mentioned death and your Canadian special forces

1:51:39.640 --> 1:51:42.560
 and in general, thinking about mortality.

1:51:42.560 --> 1:51:44.360
 Do you think about your death?

1:51:44.360 --> 1:51:45.240
 Do you?

1:51:45.240 --> 1:51:46.080
 Yeah.

1:51:46.080 --> 1:51:49.000
 Do you contemplate the end, that this thing,

1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:50.640
 that this ride ends?

1:51:50.640 --> 1:51:52.000
 All the time, yeah.

1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:55.400
 From, I've thought about death from a young age.

1:51:55.400 --> 1:51:56.800
 Are you afraid of it?

1:51:56.800 --> 1:51:58.040
 Yeah, I hate it.

1:51:58.040 --> 1:51:59.360
 Yeah, I don't wanna die.

1:51:59.360 --> 1:52:01.440
 Yeah, definitely don't wanna die.

1:52:02.560 --> 1:52:06.120
 But there's times when I can rid myself of it, yeah.

1:52:06.120 --> 1:52:11.120
 But for sure, I mean, I'm not happy that death is inevitable

1:52:11.120 --> 1:52:16.120
 and I'm not happy that potentially it's inevitable

1:52:16.920 --> 1:52:21.920
 for all of us, but it does, I like to fight against it.

1:52:25.400 --> 1:52:28.960
 Does it, if you could be immortal, would you choose to?

1:52:28.960 --> 1:52:30.760
 That's my only wish.

1:52:30.760 --> 1:52:32.240
 Oh, see, but here's the thing.

1:52:32.240 --> 1:52:35.240
 That's, but the point is to have that wish.

1:52:35.240 --> 1:52:40.240
 It's like the all you can eat buffet at sushi.

1:52:40.240 --> 1:52:44.000
 It's, that sushi's more delicious if you have a limit.

1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:44.960
 Do you have a, oh.

1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:47.240
 Well, I don't know.

1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:49.560
 I mean, I don't think I get sick of stuff.

1:52:49.560 --> 1:52:50.880
 I'm very simple.

1:52:50.880 --> 1:52:52.560
 Yeah, I don't think I would get tired of it.

1:52:52.560 --> 1:52:54.000
 I really don't.

1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:56.200
 I mean, if someone would pose it to you,

1:52:56.200 --> 1:52:57.760
 do you wanna live forever?

1:52:57.760 --> 1:52:59.360
 You would choose no?

1:52:59.360 --> 1:53:00.440
 Yeah, I would choose no.

1:53:00.440 --> 1:53:01.280
 Choose no.

1:53:01.280 --> 1:53:03.280
 Well, my answer's probably yes.

1:53:04.480 --> 1:53:08.980
 Like, no, I would, it's more like the snooze button.

1:53:08.980 --> 1:53:11.700
 Do you wanna, do you, do you want?

1:53:11.700 --> 1:53:13.820
 Well, you could go to sleep.

1:53:13.820 --> 1:53:16.060
 But it's very difficult in the moment to go to sleep,

1:53:16.060 --> 1:53:20.240
 but if I'm allowed to live forever,

1:53:21.180 --> 1:53:26.180
 I'm going to delay all the crazy,

1:53:26.460 --> 1:53:30.020
 like all the ambitious goals, all the,

1:53:30.020 --> 1:53:31.540
 because, oh, there's always time.

1:53:31.540 --> 1:53:33.380
 That's fine, but there is tomorrow, then.

1:53:33.380 --> 1:53:34.620
 But there is tomorrow, but see,

1:53:34.620 --> 1:53:37.780
 I think that takes away from the richness of,

1:53:37.780 --> 1:53:41.420
 like, the richness of the lived experience

1:53:41.420 --> 1:53:42.740
 of just each moment.

1:53:42.740 --> 1:53:45.100
 I think the richness of each moment

1:53:45.100 --> 1:53:48.420
 comes from saying, like, I could die tonight.

1:53:48.420 --> 1:53:51.900
 Like, that, it tastes delicious because you're gonna die.

1:53:51.900 --> 1:53:54.540
 I'm afraid if you're not,

1:53:54.540 --> 1:53:55.860
 I'm afraid all of that goes away,

1:53:55.860 --> 1:53:58.900
 all of that magic goes away if you can live forever.

1:53:58.900 --> 1:53:59.740
 I don't know.

1:53:59.740 --> 1:54:01.000
 I don't know.

1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:05.180
 But I'll tell you, every time I have a near death experience

1:54:05.180 --> 1:54:06.260
 or think I'm gonna die,

1:54:06.260 --> 1:54:09.140
 I definitely live better afterwards, yeah.

1:54:09.140 --> 1:54:11.540
 Like, it's always been that way.

1:54:11.540 --> 1:54:14.280
 But yeah, no.

1:54:14.280 --> 1:54:15.840
 That's why the Stoics, you know,

1:54:15.840 --> 1:54:19.220
 they really preach contemplating your mortality often.

1:54:19.220 --> 1:54:21.600
 It kind of reminds you.

1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:23.620
 This whole thing could just end any moment

1:54:23.620 --> 1:54:25.900
 and it makes you really appreciate.

1:54:25.900 --> 1:54:27.860
 Yeah, I don't know.

1:54:27.860 --> 1:54:29.020
 I don't know.

1:54:29.020 --> 1:54:34.020
 Certainly improving the quality of life is important.

1:54:34.020 --> 1:54:39.020
 But part of me thinks that immortality

1:54:39.340 --> 1:54:43.540
 is not as fun as we would like to imagine.

1:54:43.540 --> 1:54:45.800
 Do you think that maybe you're,

1:54:46.820 --> 1:54:50.140
 in what you're building potentially is immortal?

1:54:50.140 --> 1:54:54.620
 Well, that's what I definitely think about with robots.

1:54:56.820 --> 1:55:00.060
 If they were to have a humanlike experience

1:55:00.060 --> 1:55:01.700
 and be able to interact with humans

1:55:01.700 --> 1:55:03.460
 in a deep, meaningful way,

1:55:03.460 --> 1:55:05.580
 I think they too have to be mortal

1:55:05.580 --> 1:55:08.400
 in some fundamental way that means mortal.

1:55:08.400 --> 1:55:10.960
 Like, their ride has to end as well.

1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:15.280
 Because they won't be able to interact with humans deeply

1:55:15.280 --> 1:55:17.020
 unless that's the case.

1:55:18.340 --> 1:55:23.340
 Like, to have fear, to have love,

1:55:25.180 --> 1:55:28.720
 the ability to suffer, the ability to miss somebody,

1:55:29.740 --> 1:55:32.820
 I think scarcity is important.

1:55:32.820 --> 1:55:36.660
 You have to be able to truly lose somebody.

1:55:36.660 --> 1:55:38.460
 You have to be, to fear things,

1:55:38.460 --> 1:55:43.180
 you have to truly have the risk of destroying yourself.

1:55:43.180 --> 1:55:46.420
 And to have a sense of what it means to be a self,

1:55:47.740 --> 1:55:51.100
 you have to be able to lose it.

1:55:51.100 --> 1:55:53.940
 So if you're immortal, you're just going to be,

1:55:53.940 --> 1:55:58.020
 I feel like you're going to be like a toaster,

1:55:58.020 --> 1:56:00.740
 an intelligent toaster that just serves.

1:56:00.740 --> 1:56:03.140
 There's such a negative perspective on it.

1:56:03.140 --> 1:56:04.060
 And then mortality?

1:56:04.060 --> 1:56:05.980
 Yeah, just think, well, now you just,

1:56:05.980 --> 1:56:08.480
 you can get all those things done that you want to do.

1:56:08.480 --> 1:56:10.720
 I hope you're right, I hope you're right.

1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:14.260
 Yeah, I mean, potentially, you could invest even harder

1:56:14.260 --> 1:56:16.060
 because you're like, wow, I'm actually going to be able

1:56:16.060 --> 1:56:17.500
 to get all this stuff done.

1:56:17.500 --> 1:56:20.600
 I think about this a lot, I hope you're right,

1:56:20.600 --> 1:56:25.220
 but I fear that the drive to create,

1:56:25.220 --> 1:56:28.140
 I can even do more, all of that dissipates,

1:56:28.140 --> 1:56:31.380
 disappears if you have all the time in the world.

1:56:31.380 --> 1:56:33.500
 I just know how lazy I am.

1:56:33.500 --> 1:56:35.260
 And if I have all the time in the world,

1:56:35.260 --> 1:56:39.160
 I'm just going to sit there and just watch

1:56:39.160 --> 1:56:43.380
 the stupidest YouTube videos for the rest of all eternity.

1:56:44.620 --> 1:56:46.340
 Now, eternity's a long time.

1:56:46.340 --> 1:56:50.420
 Eat Doritos and Cheetos and just get fatter and fatter.

1:56:50.420 --> 1:56:53.660
 I can get in shape later, there's always time.

1:56:53.660 --> 1:56:56.140
 That's like a long period of contemplation.

1:56:56.140 --> 1:56:59.540
 Yeah, so for the first 1,000 years,

1:56:59.540 --> 1:57:02.580
 it'll be the Dorito period of the Lex life.

1:57:02.580 --> 1:57:06.620
 Yeah, you could be like Jabba the Hutt for 1,000 years.

1:57:06.620 --> 1:57:09.140
 You mentioned aliens, very important topic.

1:57:09.140 --> 1:57:11.300
 Do you actually think about this

1:57:11.300 --> 1:57:13.900
 has been an increased interest,

1:57:13.900 --> 1:57:18.380
 and there's been increased UFO sightings and encounters,

1:57:18.380 --> 1:57:20.840
 all that kind of stuff, the US government at least

1:57:20.840 --> 1:57:25.840
 releasing data, releasing videos of pilots,

1:57:26.980 --> 1:57:30.220
 pilot observations, and from airplanes of UFOs.

1:57:30.220 --> 1:57:31.900
 Do you think about this kind of stuff?

1:57:31.900 --> 1:57:33.940
 Because you mentioned in the following context,

1:57:33.940 --> 1:57:36.780
 you mentioned like us humans will get our shit together

1:57:37.660 --> 1:57:39.380
 when the aliens eventually come.

1:57:42.140 --> 1:57:43.860
 What do you make of all the sightings?

1:57:43.860 --> 1:57:45.780
 Is that something you think about?

1:57:45.780 --> 1:57:47.940
 I thought about it a lot when I was younger,

1:57:47.940 --> 1:57:50.820
 and I've just, I made my conclusions,

1:57:50.820 --> 1:57:54.180
 and yeah, I don't think that there's a possibility

1:57:54.180 --> 1:57:55.420
 that there aren't aliens.

1:57:55.420 --> 1:57:57.180
 I would think that it would be impossible

1:57:57.180 --> 1:57:58.580
 for there not to be aliens.

1:58:01.620 --> 1:58:03.900
 I feel like this is pretty good real estate,

1:58:03.900 --> 1:58:07.220
 so you'd probably want it,

1:58:07.220 --> 1:58:10.180
 but we already might be, well, I don't even think might.

1:58:10.180 --> 1:58:11.700
 I mean, it's probably quite likely

1:58:11.700 --> 1:58:13.660
 that we are to some degree aliens.

1:58:13.660 --> 1:58:16.900
 I mean, all life is probably to some degree alien.

1:58:16.900 --> 1:58:18.940
 I like the real estate, so the resources,

1:58:18.940 --> 1:58:21.340
 but we're also kind of interesting.

1:58:21.340 --> 1:58:24.220
 Whatever this ant colony of living organisms

1:58:24.220 --> 1:58:27.180
 that we've created, it's kind of interesting to study.

1:58:27.180 --> 1:58:29.580
 I tend to believe that the alien civilizations

1:58:29.580 --> 1:58:33.700
 that are going to reach us or have reached us

1:58:33.700 --> 1:58:35.240
 are far more intelligent,

1:58:36.440 --> 1:58:39.220
 just orders of magnitude more intelligent than us,

1:58:39.220 --> 1:58:41.940
 and so it's going to be very difficult both ways, actually,

1:58:41.940 --> 1:58:44.720
 for us to understand them and for them

1:58:44.720 --> 1:58:47.540
 to dumb themselves down enough to understand us.

1:58:47.540 --> 1:58:48.380
 Yeah, probably.

1:58:48.380 --> 1:58:52.980
 So they might even just miss our existence altogether

1:58:52.980 --> 1:58:56.140
 just because I tend to believe,

1:58:56.140 --> 1:58:57.060
 I don't know what you think,

1:58:57.060 --> 1:58:59.320
 that we're not that special

1:58:59.320 --> 1:59:02.820
 in terms of all the life forms in the universe.

1:59:02.820 --> 1:59:04.980
 There's a lot of cool stuff out there.

1:59:04.980 --> 1:59:06.900
 Has to be, has to be.

1:59:06.900 --> 1:59:08.500
 But to us, we're special.

1:59:08.500 --> 1:59:11.380
 Yeah, well, that's all that matters, right?

1:59:11.380 --> 1:59:14.700
 Even the human species is the most special to us humans.

1:59:14.700 --> 1:59:18.380
 There could be much more special species here on Earth

1:59:18.380 --> 1:59:20.180
 they were just totally oblivious to,

1:59:20.180 --> 1:59:23.140
 like trees on a scale of thousands of years.

1:59:23.140 --> 1:59:25.600
 Maybe they're onto something.

1:59:26.660 --> 1:59:27.800
 Lex, you know,

1:59:30.060 --> 1:59:34.900
 I think that so much of what makes a person special

1:59:34.900 --> 1:59:37.380
 is what they pass on, your kids.

1:59:37.380 --> 1:59:39.780
 But I think that you are quite special

1:59:39.780 --> 1:59:42.440
 because you're part of this thing

1:59:42.440 --> 1:59:45.740
 that's potentially giving birth to the next thing.

1:59:47.740 --> 1:59:48.580
 The robots.

1:59:48.580 --> 1:59:49.420
 The robots.

1:59:49.420 --> 1:59:50.960
 I should say, the funny thing is,

1:59:50.960 --> 1:59:53.860
 while talking to Devon during this podcast,

1:59:53.860 --> 1:59:57.580
 I had a doorbell ring, had to go downstairs,

1:59:57.580 --> 1:59:59.960
 and there was a big box,

2:00:01.540 --> 2:00:04.420
 medicine box with a new legged robot.

2:00:04.420 --> 2:00:07.580
 So the hilarity of you saying that is,

2:00:07.580 --> 2:00:11.100
 because that robot is actually going to likely be

2:00:11.100 --> 2:00:15.900
 the main robot that I show to the world in the coming months

2:00:15.900 --> 2:00:17.580
 because that has the,

2:00:17.580 --> 2:00:19.980
 that's the highest compute level in that robot.

2:00:19.980 --> 2:00:22.700
 So I've been playing a lot with legged robots,

2:00:22.700 --> 2:00:26.640
 the four legs, so like a dog.

2:00:28.980 --> 2:00:30.380
 I like all the robots,

2:00:30.380 --> 2:00:33.540
 but there's something about when a robot has legs,

2:00:33.540 --> 2:00:34.920
 it's able to communicate,

2:00:36.020 --> 2:00:38.320
 it's able to connect with humans in some kind of deep way,

2:00:38.320 --> 2:00:40.900
 in the way a dog can, just show affection.

2:00:40.900 --> 2:00:43.740
 Something about like, step, step, step, step,

2:00:43.740 --> 2:00:46.220
 and then the robot realizes you're here,

2:00:46.220 --> 2:00:48.500
 and then it steps and then notices you

2:00:48.500 --> 2:00:51.340
 in the way the dog does and raises its head.

2:00:52.860 --> 2:00:56.500
 It makes me feel noticed and heard

2:00:56.500 --> 2:00:59.740
 in the same way I do when a dog notices me.

2:00:59.740 --> 2:01:02.500
 That excitement, that stupid excitement of like,

2:01:02.500 --> 2:01:05.700
 yes, fellow living organism.

2:01:05.700 --> 2:01:09.340
 And what excites me about legged robots

2:01:09.340 --> 2:01:13.260
 is that holy shit, it's possible to engineer this.

2:01:13.260 --> 2:01:15.460
 It's possible to create that feeling,

2:01:15.460 --> 2:01:17.220
 and I wonder where that can go.

2:01:17.220 --> 2:01:20.280
 There's a lot of negative possible trajectories,

2:01:20.280 --> 2:01:23.060
 but I have a sense that there's positive ones too.

2:01:23.060 --> 2:01:23.900
 Adding more love to the world.

2:01:23.900 --> 2:01:25.900
 You think that they'll take us with them?

2:01:27.420 --> 2:01:29.940
 Yeah, I think so because I,

2:01:29.940 --> 2:01:33.140
 so there's this fear of robots

2:01:33.140 --> 2:01:34.880
 that they become super intelligent

2:01:34.880 --> 2:01:36.200
 and run away from us humans,

2:01:36.200 --> 2:01:38.860
 and basically become so intelligent

2:01:38.860 --> 2:01:43.400
 and then they almost just not giving a damn will destroy us.

2:01:44.540 --> 2:01:48.180
 But I think in order for robots to become intelligent,

2:01:48.180 --> 2:01:51.300
 they have to integrate themselves with society.

2:01:51.300 --> 2:01:56.300
 So they, by the very nature of how they become intelligent,

2:01:57.160 --> 2:01:58.940
 have to bring us along.

2:01:58.940 --> 2:02:02.620
 So it's not that there'll be this separate thing.

2:02:02.620 --> 2:02:05.900
 They have to, like, we'll have robots in the home.

2:02:05.900 --> 2:02:07.420
 Well, they'll be interacting with us.

2:02:07.420 --> 2:02:10.700
 You have human kids, and you have a bunch of robots.

2:02:10.700 --> 2:02:11.740
 You have robot friends.

2:02:11.740 --> 2:02:12.900
 You have human friends,

2:02:12.900 --> 2:02:16.340
 and the robots make your human to human relationships

2:02:16.340 --> 2:02:18.160
 much more meaningful and richer.

2:02:18.160 --> 2:02:20.980
 They bring more love to the world, but it's integrated.

2:02:20.980 --> 2:02:24.420
 It's not like they'll be developing smarter and smarter

2:02:26.300 --> 2:02:30.420
 as, like, sentient beings by themselves.

2:02:30.420 --> 2:02:32.380
 I think that's very difficult to do.

2:02:32.380 --> 2:02:34.500
 You have to be doing that together with humans,

2:02:34.500 --> 2:02:35.860
 and so we'll come for the ride.

2:02:35.860 --> 2:02:37.940
 There's technical things, like,

2:02:37.940 --> 2:02:41.500
 we might merge, like, cyborgs more and more.

2:02:41.500 --> 2:02:43.380
 Well, we already saw our cyborgs, right?

2:02:43.380 --> 2:02:46.420
 With the phones and so on, but more and more.

2:02:46.420 --> 2:02:50.860
 So with Elon and Neuralink, deeper integration of robots

2:02:50.860 --> 2:02:55.380
 and AI into, like, increasing the bandwidth

2:02:55.380 --> 2:02:56.920
 at which they can communicate.

2:02:56.920 --> 2:02:58.700
 So if we do implants in the brain,

2:03:00.820 --> 2:03:04.580
 I think, again, a lot of people are really nervous

2:03:04.580 --> 2:03:07.620
 about this, as am I, but I think there's a lot

2:03:07.620 --> 2:03:09.620
 of trajectories that are positive there.

2:03:10.780 --> 2:03:12.500
 That, to me, is exciting, and also,

2:03:12.500 --> 2:03:15.320
 I just don't think it's possible to stop this development,

2:03:15.320 --> 2:03:18.060
 so we should steer it.

2:03:18.060 --> 2:03:20.020
 Yeah, yeah.

2:03:20.020 --> 2:03:20.860
 For good.

2:03:20.860 --> 2:03:22.460
 Did you, I mean, you must have watched

2:03:22.460 --> 2:03:23.660
 the movie Terminator, right?

2:03:23.660 --> 2:03:25.240
 Yeah, of course, I love Terminator.

2:03:25.240 --> 2:03:28.740
 Yeah, it's probably my favorite movie of all time.

2:03:28.740 --> 2:03:35.260
 Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's the big fear, right?

2:03:35.260 --> 2:03:37.060
 Yeah, what's the conclusion with Terminator?

2:03:37.060 --> 2:03:39.280
 Isn't ultimately humanity wins?

2:03:39.280 --> 2:03:41.200
 I think they're at, like, Terminator 8 now.

2:03:41.200 --> 2:03:42.040
 Yeah.

2:03:42.040 --> 2:03:44.580
 You know, I don't know.

2:03:44.580 --> 2:03:48.280
 Yeah, and it's interesting, actually,

2:03:48.280 --> 2:03:50.200
 I was gonna bring this up as you were talking about it,

2:03:50.200 --> 2:03:54.460
 but China and the United States actually don't know

2:03:54.460 --> 2:03:59.220
 where Canada is on this, but they both have agreed

2:03:59.220 --> 2:04:00.820
 that they're not going to put limits

2:04:00.820 --> 2:04:04.540
 on autonomous weapon system development.

2:04:04.540 --> 2:04:05.380
 They're not going to.

2:04:05.380 --> 2:04:06.620
 They're not going to.

2:04:06.620 --> 2:04:08.500
 So, because China said we're not going to,

2:04:08.500 --> 2:04:12.820
 and now US officially announced that we're not, we can't.

2:04:12.820 --> 2:04:16.940
 Well, you can't, it's like, you never could, right?

2:04:16.940 --> 2:04:20.780
 As soon as it exists and it's better, people will use it.

2:04:20.780 --> 2:04:26.540
 Well, but you, there's been a global ban on bioweapons.

2:04:26.540 --> 2:04:28.820
 So, you were able to come to an agreement there

2:04:28.820 --> 2:04:32.340
 that we're not going to use biological weapons in war.

2:04:32.340 --> 2:04:34.980
 So, it was, a lot of people are really upset

2:04:34.980 --> 2:04:39.540
 that in the case of AI driven weapons,

2:04:39.540 --> 2:04:42.220
 the world said, nope, that's okay.

2:04:42.220 --> 2:04:45.140
 And so, now you have this potential

2:04:45.140 --> 2:04:48.100
 for greater and greater automation in drones,

2:04:48.100 --> 2:04:51.380
 for example, in picking bombing locations.

2:04:51.380 --> 2:04:54.540
 And so, the area at which they attack.

2:04:54.540 --> 2:04:57.540
 And so, you get, some of that stuff that you mentioned

2:04:57.540 --> 2:05:03.420
 that drew you to the military is that teamwork

2:05:03.420 --> 2:05:05.860
 between humans, that decision making.

2:05:05.860 --> 2:05:10.220
 So, there's strategy, but built into that team

2:05:10.220 --> 2:05:12.740
 is a deep humanity.

2:05:12.740 --> 2:05:17.620
 Like, even when there's an enemy, there's lines

2:05:17.620 --> 2:05:20.740
 that you're aware of, of what is ethical, what is not,

2:05:20.740 --> 2:05:23.060
 what is just and what is not.

2:05:23.060 --> 2:05:29.900
 And it's so easy for a machine to miss all of that,

2:05:29.900 --> 2:05:33.260
 plow through it and do deeply inhumane acts,

2:05:33.260 --> 2:05:34.820
 commit atrocities.

2:05:34.820 --> 2:05:38.740
 That's something that worries a lot of people.

2:05:38.740 --> 2:05:41.260
 Yeah.

2:05:41.260 --> 2:05:45.820
 Because, yeah, an AI based war is just, it's terrifying.

2:05:45.820 --> 2:05:48.380
 Especially with cyber security, which is becoming

2:05:48.380 --> 2:05:51.020
 more and more of an issue, which is hacking.

2:05:51.020 --> 2:05:51.900
 Yeah.

2:05:51.900 --> 2:05:56.900
 Sort of people that look a lot like me

2:05:57.580 --> 2:05:59.580
 being the warriors of the future.

2:05:59.580 --> 2:06:00.420
 Yeah.

2:06:00.420 --> 2:06:03.420
 Which is meaning people behind a keyboard

2:06:03.420 --> 2:06:07.460
 versus the traditional warriors.

2:06:08.340 --> 2:06:09.460
 Probably inevitable.

2:06:11.180 --> 2:06:12.100
 Yeah.

2:06:12.100 --> 2:06:13.020
 And terrifying.

2:06:13.020 --> 2:06:14.660
 It is, it is.

2:06:14.660 --> 2:06:18.020
 But I think if you believe that it's possible,

2:06:18.020 --> 2:06:19.540
 it's certainly gonna happen.

2:06:19.540 --> 2:06:22.460
 Like, at some point, it's just when, right?

2:06:22.460 --> 2:06:24.380
 When does it happen?

2:06:24.380 --> 2:06:28.340
 So that, I mean, to me, I'm ultimately optimistic

2:06:28.340 --> 2:06:29.180
 about the future.

2:06:29.180 --> 2:06:31.700
 And to me, I'm excited about the world with AI.

2:06:31.700 --> 2:06:34.980
 I'm even excited about the metaverse

2:06:34.980 --> 2:06:37.620
 and all these kinds of things, living more and more

2:06:37.620 --> 2:06:39.980
 in the digital space, in the virtual reality.

2:06:40.940 --> 2:06:43.300
 I think, so it's a part of me that grew up

2:06:43.300 --> 2:06:45.540
 in the noninternet world, noncomputer world.

2:06:46.780 --> 2:06:49.740
 It says, oh, kids these days with their video games.

2:06:49.740 --> 2:06:52.340
 There's part of me that's like that.

2:06:52.340 --> 2:06:56.980
 But I think technology at its best

2:06:56.980 --> 2:06:59.900
 can bring out the best of humanity.

2:06:59.900 --> 2:07:03.180
 And so I think virtual reality, all of these things,

2:07:03.180 --> 2:07:06.780
 over time, we'll figure out how to fix it

2:07:06.780 --> 2:07:08.140
 to bring out the humanity.

2:07:08.140 --> 2:07:12.140
 Social networks, the first generation social networks,

2:07:12.140 --> 2:07:13.660
 now Facebook, Twitter, and so on,

2:07:13.660 --> 2:07:15.020
 they have so many problems.

2:07:15.020 --> 2:07:17.140
 They're bringing out the worst in people.

2:07:17.140 --> 2:07:18.620
 But I think we're learning from that.

2:07:18.620 --> 2:07:20.620
 And I think the next generation of social networks

2:07:20.620 --> 2:07:22.380
 will be better and better and better.

2:07:22.380 --> 2:07:26.020
 And so I'm optimistic.

2:07:26.020 --> 2:07:30.940
 But of course, one reason we may have not seen aliens yet,

2:07:30.940 --> 2:07:34.180
 obviously, like in a way that's obvious,

2:07:34.180 --> 2:07:36.980
 is because once you get clever and smart

2:07:36.980 --> 2:07:40.220
 and have all this cool technology, you destroy yourself.

2:07:40.220 --> 2:07:42.980
 And we sure as humans are pretty close to that.

2:07:42.980 --> 2:07:45.060
 Yeah, yeah, there might be that limit

2:07:45.060 --> 2:07:46.940
 that is hard to get right.

2:07:46.940 --> 2:07:49.500
 I'm hoping we get all our aggression between nations

2:07:49.500 --> 2:07:52.380
 out through arm wrestling competition.

2:07:52.380 --> 2:07:53.340
 Right?

2:07:53.340 --> 2:07:54.740
 Just all of that life.

2:07:54.740 --> 2:07:56.580
 Oh my God, wouldn't that be great

2:07:56.580 --> 2:07:59.460
 if it was that simple, yeah.

2:07:59.460 --> 2:08:00.380
 Do you know if there's another

2:08:00.380 --> 2:08:02.260
 over the top type movie to be made?

2:08:02.260 --> 2:08:04.820
 Oh yeah, yeah, there's always stuff in the works.

2:08:04.820 --> 2:08:07.220
 There's actually a, there's a tournament called

2:08:07.220 --> 2:08:09.900
 Over the Top in Australia that's a couple months away.

2:08:09.900 --> 2:08:11.720
 I think they're doing an all the over the top scene.

2:08:11.720 --> 2:08:13.940
 But there are arm wrestling movies

2:08:13.940 --> 2:08:14.980
 that are being made right now.

2:08:14.980 --> 2:08:17.900
 Actually, there's a documentary that's filming me

2:08:17.900 --> 2:08:19.620
 for this whole Levan thing.

2:08:19.620 --> 2:08:23.900
 But yeah, we're probably due for another big one, yeah.

2:08:23.900 --> 2:08:26.340
 But you're also, just with your YouTube channel,

2:08:26.340 --> 2:08:27.540
 you're doing a lot for the sport.

2:08:27.540 --> 2:08:28.540
 That's really cool to see.

2:08:28.540 --> 2:08:31.400
 Just being genuine, but just being like,

2:08:32.300 --> 2:08:34.580
 looking not like you're looking today, but just like.

2:08:34.580 --> 2:08:35.420
 Yeah, yeah.

2:08:35.420 --> 2:08:36.340
 Just a beard.

2:08:36.340 --> 2:08:37.180
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, normally a mess.

2:08:37.180 --> 2:08:39.300
 Just like sleepy.

2:08:39.300 --> 2:08:41.700
 You know, and just putting yourself out there

2:08:41.700 --> 2:08:42.860
 completely as you are.

2:08:42.860 --> 2:08:44.260
 That's a beautiful thing.

2:08:44.260 --> 2:08:45.460
 The best thing about the sport

2:08:45.460 --> 2:08:47.080
 is it brings people together.

2:08:47.080 --> 2:08:47.920
 That's it.

2:08:47.920 --> 2:08:50.200
 Yeah, the community, the folks I got to interact with,

2:08:50.200 --> 2:08:54.280
 just so awesome, so excited, so full of kindness.

2:08:54.280 --> 2:08:55.900
 I'm definitely gonna find the club here

2:08:55.900 --> 2:09:00.900
 and start working on my arm wrestling game.

2:09:02.180 --> 2:09:03.900
 Devin, this is such a huge honor

2:09:03.900 --> 2:09:07.220
 that you would spend your valuable time.

2:09:07.220 --> 2:09:09.020
 You would come down to Austin.

2:09:09.020 --> 2:09:14.020
 You would hang out with me and do this conversation.

2:09:14.220 --> 2:09:16.140
 Super cool to talk to you, Lex, yeah.

2:09:16.140 --> 2:09:18.260
 As I mentioned, in case people,

2:09:18.260 --> 2:09:20.940
 you know, people I'm sure will tell me.

2:09:20.940 --> 2:09:23.420
 So I hang out with Joe Rogan all the time.

2:09:23.420 --> 2:09:24.420
 He's a friend.

2:09:24.420 --> 2:09:26.020
 I told him that he should talk to Devin.

2:09:26.020 --> 2:09:29.140
 He's going through some stuff currently, you know.

2:09:29.140 --> 2:09:31.220
 But I'm sure, I hope the conversation

2:09:31.220 --> 2:09:34.020
 between you, Devin, and Joe happens eventually.

2:09:34.020 --> 2:09:36.980
 He's, that would be epic as well,

2:09:36.980 --> 2:09:39.820
 because he's a, yeah, he loves fighting.

2:09:39.820 --> 2:09:43.420
 He loves fighting, he loves wrestling, he loves strength.

2:09:43.420 --> 2:09:47.500
 And I think all of those are, like,

2:09:47.500 --> 2:09:51.020
 so perfectly encapsulated in the sport of arm wrestling.

2:09:51.020 --> 2:09:52.660
 So thank you so much for talking to me.

2:09:52.660 --> 2:09:53.760
 Thanks so much, Lex.

2:09:55.820 --> 2:09:58.660
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Devin Larratt.

 And now, let me leave you with some words from Miyamoto Musashi.

2:10:07.700 --> 2:10:11.900
 The only reason a warrior is alive is to fight.

2:10:11.900 --> 2:10:15.460
 And the only reason a warrior fights is to win.

2:10:15.460 --> 2:10:35.460
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
