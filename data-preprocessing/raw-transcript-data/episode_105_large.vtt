00:00.000 --> 00:03.480
 The following is a conversation with Bob Langer, professor at

00:03.480 --> 00:06.960
 MIT, and one of the most cited researchers in history,

00:07.280 --> 00:11.120
 specializing in biotechnology fields of drug delivery systems

00:11.120 --> 00:15.600
 and tissue engineering. He has bridged theory and practice by

00:15.600 --> 00:19.200
 being a key member and driving force in launching many

00:19.200 --> 00:23.480
 successful biotech companies out of MIT. This conversation was

00:23.480 --> 00:27.400
 recorded before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. His

00:27.400 --> 00:30.040
 research and companies are at the forefront of developing

00:30.040 --> 00:34.000
 treatment for COVID 19, including a promising vaccine

00:34.000 --> 00:39.320
 candidate. Quick summary of the ads to sponsors cash app and

03:07.600 --> 03:10.960
 You have a bit of a love for magic. Do you see a connection

03:10.960 --> 03:12.640
 between magic and science?

03:12.640 --> 03:17.920
 I do. I think magic can surprise you. And, uh, you know, and I

03:17.920 --> 03:20.720
 think science can surprise you. And there's something magical

03:20.720 --> 03:23.960
 about, about science. I mean, making discoveries and things

03:23.960 --> 03:26.800
 like that. Yeah. So on the, and then on the magic side, is

03:26.800 --> 03:30.160
 there some kind of engineering scientific process to the tricks

03:30.160 --> 03:34.440
 themselves? Do you see, cause there's a duality to it. One is

03:34.720 --> 03:39.280
 you're the, um, you're, you're sort of the person inside that

03:39.280 --> 03:42.480
 knows how the whole thing works, how the universe of the magic

03:42.480 --> 03:45.960
 trick works. And then from the outside observer, which is kind

03:45.960 --> 03:49.560
 of the role of the scientists, you, the people that observe

03:49.560 --> 03:52.920
 the magic trick don't know at least initially anything that's

03:52.920 --> 03:55.200
 going on. Do you see that kind of duality?

03:55.720 --> 03:58.560
 Well, I think the duality that I see is fascination. You know,

03:58.560 --> 04:03.160
 I think of it, you know, when I watch magic myself, I'm always

04:03.160 --> 04:06.280
 fascinated by it. Sometimes it's a puzzle to think how it's done,

04:06.280 --> 04:09.280
 but just the sheer fact that something that you never thought

04:09.280 --> 04:13.400
 could happen does happen. And I think about that in science too,

04:13.440 --> 04:17.360
 you know, sometimes you, it's something that, that you might

04:17.360 --> 04:21.320
 dream about and hoping to discover, maybe you do in some

04:21.320 --> 04:22.000
 way or form.

04:22.600 --> 04:26.200
 What is the most amazing magic trick you've ever seen?

04:26.880 --> 04:29.480
 Well, there's one I like, which is called the invisible pack.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
 And the way it works is you have this pack and you hold it up.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.200
 Well, first you say to somebody, this is invisible and this deck

04:40.200 --> 04:43.560
 and you say, well, shuffle it. They shuffle it, but you know,

04:43.560 --> 04:46.640
 they're sort of make believe. And then you say, okay, I'd like

04:46.640 --> 04:50.440
 you to pick a card, any card and show it to me. And you show it

04:50.440 --> 04:55.120
 to me and I look at it. And let's say it's the three of

04:55.120 --> 04:57.720
 hearts. I said, we'll put it back in the deck. But what I'd

04:57.720 --> 05:00.320
 like you to do is turn it up upside down from every other

05:00.320 --> 05:04.880
 card in the deck. So they do that imaginary. And I say,

05:04.880 --> 05:07.520
 do you want to shuffle it again? And they shuffle it. And I said,

05:07.520 --> 05:10.920
 well, so there's still one card upside down from every other

05:10.920 --> 05:12.840
 card in the deck. I said, what is that? And they said, well,

05:12.840 --> 05:15.960
 three hearts. So what just so happens in my back pocket, I

05:15.960 --> 05:18.880
 have this deck, it's, you know, it's a real deck. I show it to

05:18.880 --> 05:22.080
 you and I just open it up. And there's just one card upside

05:22.080 --> 05:23.920
 down. And it's the three of hearts.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.120
 And, and you can do this trick.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.120
 I can, if I don't, I would have probably brought it.

05:33.120 --> 05:37.320
 All right. Well, beautiful. Let's get into the, into the

05:37.320 --> 05:43.360
 science. As of today, you have over 295,000 citations. An H

05:43.360 --> 05:47.760
 index of 269. You're one of the most cited people in history and

05:47.760 --> 05:52.440
 the most cited engineer in history. And yet nothing great,

05:53.000 --> 05:57.120
 I think is ever achieved without failure. So the interesting

05:57.120 --> 06:01.320
 part, what rejected papers, ideas, efforts in your life or

06:01.320 --> 06:03.880
 most painful, or had the biggest impact on your life?

06:04.440 --> 06:07.200
 Well, it's interesting. I mean, I've had plenty of rejection too,

06:07.200 --> 06:11.640
 you know, but I suppose one way I think about this is that when

06:11.640 --> 06:14.360
 I first started, and this certainly had an impact both

06:14.360 --> 06:19.200
 ways, you know, I first started, we made two big discoveries and

06:19.200 --> 06:22.720
 they were kind of interrelated. I mean, one was, I was trying to

06:22.720 --> 06:25.520
 isolate with my postdoctoral advisor, Judah Folkman,

06:25.840 --> 06:29.560
 substances that could stop blood vessels from growing and nobody

06:29.560 --> 06:35.320
 had done that before. And so that was part A, let's say part B

06:35.320 --> 06:38.320
 is we had to develop a way to study that. And what was

06:38.320 --> 06:42.280
 critical to study that was to have a way to slowly release

06:42.520 --> 06:47.080
 those substances for, you know, more than a day, you know, maybe

06:47.080 --> 06:50.480
 months. And that had never been done before either. So we

06:50.480 --> 06:55.440
 published the first one we sent to Nature, the journal, and they

06:55.440 --> 06:59.920
 rejected it. And then we sent it, we revised it, we sent it to

06:59.920 --> 07:04.440
 Science and they accepted it. And the other, the opposite

07:04.440 --> 07:06.960
 happened, we sent it to Science and they rejected it. And then

07:06.960 --> 07:10.440
 we sent it to Nature and they accepted it. But I have to tell

07:10.440 --> 07:12.800
 you, when we got the rejections, it was really upsetting. I

07:12.800 --> 07:15.760
 thought, you know, I'd done some really good work. And Dr.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.920
 Folkman thought we'd done some really good work. And, and, but

07:19.920 --> 07:24.040
 it was very depressing to, you know, get rejected like that.

07:24.040 --> 07:27.360
 If you can linger on just the feeling or the thought process

07:27.400 --> 07:30.160
 when you get the rejection, especially early on in your

07:30.160 --> 07:39.400
 career, what, I mean, you don't know, now people know you as a

07:39.400 --> 07:42.800
 brilliant scientist, but at the time, I'm sure you're full of

07:42.800 --> 07:48.360
 self doubt. And did you believe that maybe this idea is actually

07:48.360 --> 07:51.760
 quite terrible, that it could have been done much better? Or

07:51.760 --> 07:54.280
 is there underlying confidence? What was the feelings?

07:54.760 --> 07:58.640
 Well, you feel depressed and I felt the same way when I got

07:58.640 --> 08:02.440
 grants rejected, which I did a lot in the beginning. I guess

08:02.440 --> 08:07.120
 part of me, you know, you have multiple emotions. One is being

08:07.120 --> 08:11.200
 sad and being upset and also being maybe a little bit angry

08:11.200 --> 08:14.600
 because you didn't feel the reviewers didn't get it. But

08:14.600 --> 08:17.280
 then as I thought about it more, I thought, well, maybe I just

08:17.280 --> 08:20.680
 didn't explain it well enough. And you know, that, you know,

08:20.680 --> 08:24.040
 that you go through stages. And so you say, well, okay, I'll

08:24.040 --> 08:26.920
 explain it better next time. And certainly you get reviews and

08:26.920 --> 08:29.920
 when you get the reviews, you see what they either didn't like

08:29.920 --> 08:32.560
 or didn't understand. And then you try to incorporate that into

08:32.560 --> 08:33.520
 your next versions.

08:34.520 --> 08:37.840
 You've given advice to students to do something big, do

08:37.840 --> 08:40.400
 something that really can change the world rather than something

08:40.400 --> 08:45.160
 incremental. How did you yourself seek out such ideas? Is

08:45.160 --> 08:49.720
 there a process? Is there a sort of a rigorous process? Or is it

08:49.720 --> 08:50.880
 more spontaneous?

08:51.320 --> 08:55.520
 It's more spontaneous. I mean, part of its exposure to things,

08:55.600 --> 08:58.960
 part of its seeing other people, like I mentioned, Dr. Folkman,

08:58.960 --> 09:02.000
 he was my postdoctoral advisor, he was very good at that, you

09:02.000 --> 09:05.200
 could sort of see that he had big ideas. And I certainly met a

09:05.200 --> 09:08.720
 lot of people who didn't. And I think you could spot an idea

09:08.720 --> 09:11.400
 that might have potential when you see it, you know, because it

09:11.400 --> 09:14.120
 could have very broad implications, whereas a lot of

09:14.120 --> 09:19.480
 people might just keep doing derivative stuff. And so I

09:19.480 --> 09:23.560
 don't know. But it's not something that I've ever done.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.160
 Systematically, I don't think.

09:26.680 --> 09:30.960
 So in the space of ideas, how many are just when you see them?

09:31.200 --> 09:34.320
 It's just magic. It's something that you see that could be

09:34.320 --> 09:37.880
 impactful if you dig deeper.

09:38.680 --> 09:42.080
 Yeah, it's sort of hard to say because there's multiple levels

09:42.080 --> 09:49.040
 of ideas. One type of thing is like a new, you know, creation

09:49.040 --> 09:51.480
 that you could engineer tissues for the first time or make

09:51.480 --> 09:54.640
 dishes from scratch on the first time. But another thing is

09:54.640 --> 09:58.480
 really just deeply understanding something. And that's important

09:58.480 --> 10:04.240
 too. So and that may lead to other things. So sometimes you

10:04.280 --> 10:07.440
 could think of a new technology, or I thought of a new

10:07.440 --> 10:11.600
 technology. But other times, things came from just the

10:11.600 --> 10:15.840
 process of trying to discover things. So it's never and you

10:15.840 --> 10:19.760
 don't necessarily know, like people talk about aha moments,

10:19.760 --> 10:23.320
 but I don't know if I've, I mean, I certainly feel like I've

10:23.320 --> 10:27.840
 had some ideas that I really like. But it's taken me a long

10:27.840 --> 10:32.720
 time to go from the thought process of starting it to all of

10:32.720 --> 10:35.120
 a sudden, knowing that it might work.

10:35.520 --> 10:39.200
 So if you take drug delivery, for example, is the notion is

10:39.200 --> 10:43.760
 the initial notion, kind of a very general one, that we should

10:43.760 --> 10:48.400
 be able to do something like this. And then you start to ask

10:48.400 --> 10:51.120
 the questions of Well, how would you do it and then and then

10:51.120 --> 10:52.400
 digging and digging and digging?

10:52.680 --> 10:54.840
 I think that's right. I think it depends. I mean, there are

10:54.840 --> 10:58.280
 many different examples. The example I gave about delivering

10:58.520 --> 11:01.880
 large molecules, which we used to study these blood vessel

11:01.880 --> 11:05.280
 inhibitors. I mean, there, we had to invent something that

11:05.280 --> 11:10.200
 would do that. But other times, it's, it's, it's different.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.000
 Sometimes it's really understanding what goes on in

11:13.000 --> 11:16.520
 terms of understanding the mechanisms. And so it's, it's,

11:16.560 --> 11:19.120
 it's not a single thing. And there are many different parts

11:19.120 --> 11:23.240
 to it, you know, over the years, we've invented different or

11:23.240 --> 11:27.680
 discovered different principles for aerosols for delivering,

11:27.720 --> 11:30.200
 you know, genetic therapy agents, you know, all kinds of

11:30.200 --> 11:30.680
 things.

11:31.600 --> 11:34.120
 So let's explore some of the key ideas you've touched on in your

11:34.120 --> 11:39.200
 life. Let's start with the basics. Okay. So first, let me

11:39.200 --> 11:42.640
 ask, how complicated is the biology and chemistry of the

11:42.640 --> 11:46.600
 human body from the perspective of trying to affect some parts

11:46.600 --> 11:50.560
 of it in a positive way? So that you know, for me, especially

11:50.560 --> 11:54.280
 coming from the field of computer science and computer

11:54.280 --> 11:57.720
 engineering and robotics, it seems that the human body is

11:57.720 --> 12:00.440
 exceptionally complicated, and how the heck you can figure out

12:00.440 --> 12:01.680
 anything is amazing.

12:02.120 --> 12:05.080
 I agree with you. I think it's super complicated. I mean,

12:05.080 --> 12:08.320
 we're still just scratching the surface in many ways. But I feel

12:08.320 --> 12:12.280
 like we have made progress in different ways. And some of its

12:12.280 --> 12:16.200
 by really understanding things like we were just talking about

12:16.440 --> 12:19.600
 other times, you know, you might, or somebody might we or

12:19.600 --> 12:23.480
 others might invent technologies that might be helpful on

12:23.520 --> 12:26.920
 exploring that. And I think over many years, we've understood

12:26.920 --> 12:29.200
 things better and better, but we still have such a long ways to

12:29.200 --> 12:29.520
 go.

12:29.640 --> 12:34.000
 Are there? I mean, if you just look at the other things that

12:35.480 --> 12:39.280
 are there knobs that are reliably controllable about the

12:39.280 --> 12:46.040
 human body, if you consider is there is it? So if you start to

12:46.040 --> 12:49.840
 think about controlling various aspects of when we talk about

12:49.880 --> 12:54.240
 drug delivery a little bit, but controlling various aspects

12:54.240 --> 12:57.800
 chemically of the human body, is there a solid understanding

12:57.800 --> 13:02.000
 across the populations of humans that are solid, reliable knobs

13:02.040 --> 13:02.920
 that can be controlled?

13:03.320 --> 13:06.680
 I think that's hard to do. But on the other hand, whenever we

13:06.680 --> 13:09.520
 make a new drug or medical device, to a certain extent,

13:09.520 --> 13:12.840
 we're doing that, you know, in a small way, what you just said,

13:12.840 --> 13:16.880
 but I don't know that there are great knobs. I mean, and we're

13:16.880 --> 13:20.160
 learning about those knobs all the time. But if there's a

13:20.160 --> 13:23.880
 biological pathway or something that you can affect, or

13:23.880 --> 13:26.960
 understand, I mean, then that might be such a knob.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.640
 So what is a pharmaceutical drug? How do you do? How do you

13:31.640 --> 13:34.720
 discover a specific one? How do you test it? How do you

13:34.720 --> 13:36.640
 understand it? How do you ship it?

13:36.840 --> 13:40.680
 Yeah, well, I'll give an example, which goes back to

13:40.680 --> 13:43.840
 what I said before. So when I was doing my postdoctoral work

13:43.840 --> 13:46.560
 with Judah Folkman, we wanted to come up with drugs that would

13:46.560 --> 13:49.760
 stop blood vessels from growing or alternatively make them grow.

13:50.280 --> 13:54.160
 And actually, people didn't even believe that, that those things

13:54.160 --> 13:55.920
 could happen. But

13:56.040 --> 13:58.560
 could we pause on that for a second? Sure. What is a blood

13:58.560 --> 14:01.920
 vessel? What does it mean for a blood vessel to grow and shrink?

14:01.920 --> 14:03.040
 And why is that important?

14:03.040 --> 14:08.360
 Sure. So a blood vessel is could be an artery or vein or a

14:08.360 --> 14:14.600
 capillary. And it, you know, provides oxygen, it provides

14:14.600 --> 14:19.960
 nutrients gets rid of waste. So, you know, to different parts of

14:19.960 --> 14:23.600
 your body if you so so the blood vessels end up being very, very

14:23.600 --> 14:29.920
 important. And, you know, if you have cancer, blood vessels grow

14:29.920 --> 14:32.680
 into the tumor. And that's part of what enables the tumor to get

14:32.680 --> 14:36.440
 bigger. And that's also part of what enables the tumor to

14:36.440 --> 14:39.600
 metastasize and which means spread throughout the body and

14:39.880 --> 14:42.760
 ultimately kill somebody. So that was part of what we were

14:42.760 --> 14:45.520
 trying to do. We tried what we wanted to see if we could find

14:45.680 --> 14:49.280
 substances that could stop that from happening. So first, I

14:49.280 --> 14:51.680
 mean, there are many steps. First, we had to develop a bio

14:51.680 --> 14:54.280
 assay to study blood vessel growth. Again, there wasn't

14:54.280 --> 14:57.960
 one. That's where we needed the polymer systems because the

14:57.960 --> 15:03.360
 blood vessels grew slowly took months. That so after we had the

15:03.360 --> 15:07.440
 polymer system and we had the bio assay, then I isolated many

15:07.440 --> 15:12.920
 different molecules initially from cartilage. And almost all

15:12.920 --> 15:17.080
 of them didn't work. But we were fortunate we found one it wasn't

15:17.080 --> 15:21.400
 purified, but we found one that did work. And that paper that

15:21.400 --> 15:24.960
 was this paper I mentioned science in 1976. Those were

15:24.960 --> 15:27.920
 really the isolation of some of the very first angiogenesis and

15:27.920 --> 15:29.000
 blood vessel inhibitors.

15:29.560 --> 15:34.000
 So there's a lot of words there. Yeah, let's go. First of all,

15:34.040 --> 15:38.680
 polymer molecules, big, big molecules. So the what are

15:38.680 --> 15:45.000
 polymers? What's bio assay? What is the process of trying to

15:45.000 --> 15:46.920
 isolate this whole thing simplified to where you can

15:46.920 --> 15:48.360
 control and experiment with it?

15:48.480 --> 15:54.960
 Polymers are like plastics or like plastics or rubber. What

15:54.960 --> 15:55.960
 were some of the other questions?

15:55.960 --> 15:59.000
 Sorry, so a polymer, some plastics and rubber, and that

15:59.000 --> 16:01.280
 means something that has structure and that could be

16:01.280 --> 16:02.840
 useful for what?

16:03.080 --> 16:05.680
 Well, in this case, it would be something that could be useful

16:05.680 --> 16:10.680
 for delivering a molecule for a long time. So it could slowly

16:10.680 --> 16:13.840
 diffuse out of that at a controlled rate to where you

16:13.840 --> 16:14.800
 wanted it to go.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.720
 So then you would find the idea is that there would be a

16:17.720 --> 16:22.760
 particular blood vessels that you can target, say they're

16:22.760 --> 16:26.600
 connected somehow to a tumor that you could target and over

16:27.200 --> 16:31.680
 a long period of time to be able to place the polymer there

16:31.680 --> 16:34.600
 and it'd be delivering a certain kind of chemical.

16:34.680 --> 16:37.920
 That's correct. I think what you said is good. So so that it

16:37.920 --> 16:41.520
 would deliver the molecule or the chemical that would stop

16:41.520 --> 16:44.120
 the blood vessels from going over a long enough time so that

16:44.120 --> 16:47.920
 it really could happen. So that was sort of the what we call

16:47.920 --> 16:50.240
 the bio assay is the way that we would study that.

16:50.240 --> 16:53.840
 So, sorry, so what is a bio assay? Which part is the bio

16:53.840 --> 16:54.320
 assay?

16:54.360 --> 16:58.840
 All of it. In other words, the bio assay is the way you study

17:00.080 --> 17:01.000
 blood vessel growth.

17:01.680 --> 17:05.000
 The blood vessel growth and you can control that somehow with

17:05.720 --> 17:08.080
 is there an understanding what kind of chemicals could control

17:08.080 --> 17:09.040
 the growth of a blood vessel?

17:09.040 --> 17:11.560
 Sure. Well, now there is, but then when I started, there

17:11.560 --> 17:14.600
 wasn't and that that gets to your original question. So you

17:14.600 --> 17:17.400
 go through various steps. We did the first steps. We showed

17:17.400 --> 17:20.240
 that a such molecules existed and then we developed

17:20.240 --> 17:24.920
 techniques for studying them. And we even isolated fractions,

17:24.920 --> 17:28.880
 you know, groups of substances that would do it. But what

17:28.880 --> 17:33.360
 would happen over the next, we did that in 1976, we published

17:33.360 --> 17:37.160
 that what would happen over the next 28 years is other people

17:37.160 --> 17:39.640
 would follow in our footsteps. I mean, we tried to do some

17:39.640 --> 17:43.760
 stuff too, but ultimately to make a new drug takes billions

17:43.760 --> 17:47.920
 of dollars. So what happened was there were different growth

17:47.920 --> 17:50.760
 factors that people would isolate, sometimes using the

17:50.760 --> 17:55.760
 techniques that we developed. And then they would figure out

17:55.760 --> 17:58.720
 using some of those techniques, ways to stop those growth

17:58.720 --> 18:02.400
 factors and ways to stop the blood vessels from growing. That

18:02.400 --> 18:05.040
 like I say, it took 28 years, it took billions of dollars and

18:05.040 --> 18:11.160
 work by many companies like Genetec. But in 2004, 28 years

18:11.160 --> 18:15.720
 after we started, the first one of those Avastin got approved

18:15.720 --> 18:20.920
 by the FDA. And that's become, you know, one of the top

18:20.920 --> 18:23.920
 biotech selling drugs in history. And it's been approved

18:23.920 --> 18:27.200
 for all kinds of cancers and actually for many eye diseases

18:27.200 --> 18:30.640
 too, where you have abnormal blood vessel growth, macular.

18:30.640 --> 18:38.480
 So in general, one of the key ways you can alleviate, what's

18:38.480 --> 18:41.960
 the hope in terms of tumors associated with cancerous

18:41.960 --> 18:46.640
 tumors? What can you help by being able to control the

18:46.640 --> 18:47.840
 growth of vessels?

18:47.840 --> 18:52.680
 So if you cut off the blood supply, you cut off the, it's

18:52.680 --> 18:56.600
 kind of like a war almost, right? If the nutrition is going

18:56.600 --> 19:01.480
 to the tumor and you can cut it off, I mean, you starve the

19:01.480 --> 19:05.240
 tumor and it becomes very small, it may disappear or it's going

19:05.240 --> 19:08.120
 to be much more amenable to other therapies because it is

19:08.120 --> 19:12.200
 tiny, you know, like, you know, chemotherapy or immunotherapy

19:12.200 --> 19:15.000
 is going to be, have a much easier time against a small

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
 tumor than a big one.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.880
 Is that an obvious idea? I mean, it seems like a very clever

19:20.880 --> 19:23.880
 strategy in this war against cancer.

19:23.880 --> 19:27.480
 Well, you know, in retrospect, it's an obvious idea, but when

19:27.480 --> 19:31.880
 Dr. Folkman, my boss first proposed it, it wasn't, a lot of

19:31.880 --> 19:33.600
 people didn't thought he was pretty crazy.

19:33.600 --> 19:39.360
 And so in what sense, if you can sort of linger on it, when

19:39.360 --> 19:42.280
 you're thinking about these ideas at the time, were you

19:42.280 --> 19:43.560
 feeling you're out in the dark?

19:43.560 --> 19:46.760
 So how much mystery is there about the whole thing?

19:46.760 --> 19:50.520
 How much just blind experimentation, if you can put

19:50.520 --> 19:52.400
 yourself in that mindset from years ago?

19:52.400 --> 19:52.840
 Yeah.

19:52.840 --> 19:56.480
 Well, there was, I mean, for me, actually, it wasn't just

19:56.480 --> 19:56.960
 the idea.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.520
 It was that I didn't know a lot of biology or biochemistry.

19:59.520 --> 20:03.440
 So I certainly felt I was in the dark, but I kept trying and

20:03.440 --> 20:06.040
 I kept trying to learn and I kept plugging.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.520
 But I mean, a lot of it was being in the dark.

20:08.520 --> 20:11.320
 So the human body is complicated, right?

20:11.320 --> 20:12.280
 We'll establish this.

20:12.280 --> 20:16.680
 Quantum mechanics in physics is a theory that works incredibly

20:16.680 --> 20:19.720
 well, but we don't really necessarily understand the underlying

20:19.720 --> 20:20.360
 nature of it.

20:20.360 --> 20:25.280
 So are drugs the same in that you're ultimately trying to

20:25.280 --> 20:29.880
 show that the thing works to do something that you try to do,

20:29.880 --> 20:33.520
 but you don't necessarily understand the fundamental

20:33.520 --> 20:35.360
 mechanisms by which it's doing it?

20:35.360 --> 20:36.760
 It really varies.

20:36.760 --> 20:40.200
 I think sometimes people do know them because they've figured

20:40.200 --> 20:42.640
 out pathways and ways to interfere with them.

20:42.640 --> 20:45.160
 Other times it is shooting in the dark.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.640
 It really has varied.

20:46.640 --> 20:47.160
 Okay.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.960
 And sometimes people make serendipitous discoveries and

20:49.960 --> 20:51.840
 they don't even realize what they did.

20:51.840 --> 20:55.960
 So what is the discovery process for a drug?

20:55.960 --> 20:59.120
 You said a bunch of people trying to work with this.

20:59.120 --> 21:08.360
 Is it a kind of a mix of serendipitous discovery and art,

21:08.360 --> 21:12.840
 or is there a systematic science to trying different chemical

21:12.840 --> 21:16.960
 reactions and how they affect whatever you're trying to do,

21:16.960 --> 21:18.840
 like shrink blood vessels?

21:18.840 --> 21:22.480
 Yeah, I don't think there's a single way to go about

21:22.480 --> 21:25.320
 something in terms of characterizing the entire drug

21:25.320 --> 21:26.440
 discovery process.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.600
 If I look at the blood vessel one,

21:28.600 --> 21:34.400
 yeah, there the first step was to have the kinds of theories

21:34.400 --> 21:35.400
 that Dr. Folkman had.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.120
 The second step was to have the techniques where you could

21:38.120 --> 21:40.880
 study blood vessel growth for the first time and at least

21:40.880 --> 21:44.200
 quantitate or semi quantitate it.

21:44.200 --> 21:48.120
 Third step was to find substances that would stop blood

21:48.120 --> 21:49.680
 vessels from growing.

21:49.680 --> 21:54.440
 Fourth step was to maybe purify those substances.

21:54.440 --> 21:55.760
 There are many other steps too.

21:55.760 --> 21:57.680
 I mean, before you have an effective drug,

21:57.680 --> 21:58.800
 you have to show that it's safe.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.600
 You have to show that it's effective.

22:00.600 --> 22:01.880
 And you start with animals.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.600
 You ultimately go to patients.

22:03.600 --> 22:06.400
 And there are multiple kinds of clinical trials you have to do.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.720
 If you step back, is it amazing to you

22:08.720 --> 22:11.680
 that we descendants of great apes

22:11.680 --> 22:18.040
 are able to create drugs, chemicals that

22:18.040 --> 22:22.160
 are able to improve some aspects of our bodies?

22:22.160 --> 22:25.240
 Or is it quite natural that we're

22:25.240 --> 22:27.760
 able to discover these kinds of things?

22:27.760 --> 22:29.800
 Well, at a high level, it is amazing.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.600
 I mean, evolution is amazing.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.960
 The way I look at your question, the fact

22:33.960 --> 22:36.320
 that we have evolved the way we've done,

22:36.320 --> 22:38.600
 I mean, it's pretty remarkable.

22:38.600 --> 22:41.200
 So let's talk about drug delivery.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.640
 What are the difficult problems in drug delivery?

22:43.640 --> 22:48.240
 What is drug delivery from starting

22:48.240 --> 22:51.160
 from your early seminal work in the field to today?

22:51.160 --> 22:55.840
 Well, drug delivery is getting a drug

22:55.840 --> 22:57.960
 to go where you want it, at the level you want it,

22:57.960 --> 22:59.720
 in a safe way.

22:59.720 --> 23:02.040
 Some of the big challenges, I mean, there are a lot.

23:02.040 --> 23:06.520
 I mean, I'd say one is, could you target the right cell?

23:06.520 --> 23:08.240
 Like, we talked about cancers or some way

23:08.240 --> 23:11.880
 to deliver a drug just to a cancer cell and no other cell.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.640
 Another challenge is to get drugs

23:14.640 --> 23:15.840
 across different barriers.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.640
 Like, could you ever give insulin orally?

23:17.640 --> 23:21.320
 Could you, or give it passively transdermally?

23:21.320 --> 23:24.000
 Can you get drugs across the blood brain barrier?

23:24.000 --> 23:26.240
 I mean, there are lots of big challenges.

23:26.240 --> 23:29.040
 Can you make smart drug delivery systems

23:29.040 --> 23:32.400
 that might respond to physiologic signals in the body?

23:32.400 --> 23:33.240
 Oh, interesting.

23:33.240 --> 23:37.040
 So smart, they have some kind of sense,

23:37.040 --> 23:39.280
 a chemical sensor, or is there something more

23:39.280 --> 23:41.280
 than a chemical sensor that's able to respond

23:41.280 --> 23:43.120
 to something in the body?

23:43.120 --> 23:44.040
 Could be either one.

23:44.040 --> 23:48.600
 I mean, one example might be if you were diabetic,

23:48.600 --> 23:53.320
 if you got more glucose, could you get more insulin?

23:53.320 --> 23:57.040
 But that's just an example.

23:57.040 --> 23:59.480
 Is there some way to control the actual mechanism

23:59.480 --> 24:02.240
 of delivery in response to what the body's doing?

24:02.240 --> 24:03.200
 Yes, there is.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.000
 I mean, one of the things that we've done

24:05.000 --> 24:07.520
 is encapsulate what are called beta cells.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.840
 Those are insulin producing cells in a way

24:09.840 --> 24:11.800
 that they're safe and protected.

24:11.800 --> 24:15.280
 And then what'll happen is glucose will go in

24:15.280 --> 24:20.280
 and the cells will make insulin.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.120
 And so that's an example.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.880
 So from an AI robotics perspective,

24:25.880 --> 24:29.280
 how close are these drug delivery systems

24:29.280 --> 24:31.040
 to something like a robot?

24:31.040 --> 24:33.640
 Or is it totally wrong to think about them

24:33.640 --> 24:35.480
 as intelligent agents?

24:35.480 --> 24:39.600
 And how much room is there to add that kind of intelligence

24:39.600 --> 24:42.080
 into these delivery systems, perhaps in the future?

24:42.080 --> 24:45.280
 Yeah, I think it depends on the particular delivery system.

24:45.280 --> 24:47.040
 Of course, one of the things people are concerned about

24:47.040 --> 24:49.560
 is cost, and if you add a lot of bells and whistles

24:49.560 --> 24:51.400
 to something, it'll cost more.

24:51.400 --> 24:54.200
 But I mean, we, for example, have made

24:54.200 --> 24:55.920
 what I'll call intelligent microchips

24:55.920 --> 24:58.840
 that can, where you can send a signal

24:58.840 --> 25:01.840
 and you'll release drug in response to that signal.

25:01.840 --> 25:04.600
 And I think systems like that microchip someday

25:04.600 --> 25:06.040
 have the potential to do what you and I

25:06.040 --> 25:07.400
 were just talking about,

25:07.400 --> 25:09.480
 that there could be a signal like glucose

25:09.480 --> 25:11.600
 and it could have some instruction to say

25:11.600 --> 25:14.360
 when there's more glucose, deliver more insulin.

25:14.360 --> 25:16.000
 So do you think it's possible that there,

25:16.000 --> 25:19.640
 that could be robotic type systems roaming our body

25:19.640 --> 25:21.640
 sort of long term and be able to deliver

25:21.640 --> 25:23.600
 certain kinds of drugs in the future?

25:23.600 --> 25:26.320
 You see, do you see that kind of future?

25:26.320 --> 25:29.000
 Someday, I don't think we're very close to it yet,

25:29.000 --> 25:31.880
 but someday, you know that that's nanotechnology

25:31.880 --> 25:33.720
 and that would mean even miniaturizing

25:33.720 --> 25:35.760
 some of the things that I just discussed.

25:35.760 --> 25:37.800
 And we're certainly not at that point yet,

25:37.800 --> 25:40.120
 but someday I expect we will be.

25:40.120 --> 25:44.240
 So some of it is just the shrinking of the technology.

25:44.240 --> 25:47.280
 That's a part of it, that's one of the things.

25:47.280 --> 25:52.200
 In general, what role do you see AI sort of,

25:52.200 --> 25:55.160
 there's a lot of work now with using data

25:55.160 --> 25:57.200
 to make intelligent, create systems

25:57.200 --> 25:59.080
 that make intelligent decisions.

25:59.080 --> 26:04.080
 Do you see any of that data driven kind of computing systems

26:04.080 --> 26:09.080
 having a role in any part of this,

26:09.480 --> 26:13.320
 into the delivery of drugs, the design of drugs

26:13.320 --> 26:15.240
 and any part of the chain?

26:15.240 --> 26:18.080
 I do, I think that AI can be useful

26:18.080 --> 26:20.040
 in a number of parts of the chain.

26:20.040 --> 26:22.880
 I mean, one, I think if you get a large amount

26:22.880 --> 26:26.320
 of information, you know, say you have some chemical data

26:26.320 --> 26:29.040
 because you've done high throughput screens

26:29.040 --> 26:30.600
 and let's, I'll just make this up,

26:30.600 --> 26:33.560
 but let's say I have a, I'm trying to come up with a drug

26:33.560 --> 26:37.800
 to treat disease X, whatever that disease is

26:37.800 --> 26:42.800
 and I have a test for that and hopefully a fast test

26:43.520 --> 26:47.520
 and let's say I test 10,000 chemical substances

26:47.520 --> 26:49.960
 and a couple work, most of them don't work,

26:49.960 --> 26:52.640
 some maybe work a little, but if I had a,

26:52.640 --> 26:54.920
 with the right kind of artificial intelligence,

26:54.920 --> 26:57.160
 maybe you could look at the chemical structures

26:57.160 --> 26:58.480
 and look at what works and see

26:58.480 --> 26:59.760
 if there's certain commonalities,

26:59.760 --> 27:02.480
 look at what doesn't work and see what commonalities

27:02.480 --> 27:05.240
 there are and then maybe use that somehow

27:05.240 --> 27:07.040
 to predict the next generation of things

27:07.040 --> 27:08.520
 that you would test.

27:08.520 --> 27:10.760
 As a tangent, what are your thoughts

27:10.760 --> 27:14.840
 on our society's relationship with pharmaceutical drugs?

27:14.840 --> 27:17.400
 Do we, and perhaps I apologize

27:17.400 --> 27:19.880
 if this is a philosophical broader question,

27:19.880 --> 27:22.240
 but do we over rely on them?

27:22.240 --> 27:24.720
 Do we improperly prescribe them?

27:24.720 --> 27:26.560
 In what ways is the system working well

27:26.560 --> 27:28.040
 and what way can it improve?

27:28.040 --> 27:33.040
 Well, I think pharmaceutical drugs are really important.

27:33.040 --> 27:37.080
 I mean, the life expectancy and life quality of people

27:37.080 --> 27:40.200
 over many, many years has increased tremendously

27:40.200 --> 27:42.120
 and I think that's a really good thing.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.080
 I think one thing that would also be good

27:44.080 --> 27:45.920
 is if we could extend that more and more

27:45.920 --> 27:47.720
 to people in the developing world,

27:47.720 --> 27:49.920
 which is something that our lab has been doing

27:49.920 --> 27:52.240
 with the Gates Foundation or trying to do.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.800
 So I think ways in which it could improve,

27:55.800 --> 27:59.320
 I mean, if there was some way to reduce costs,

27:59.320 --> 28:01.680
 that's certainly an issue people are concerned about.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.280
 If there was some way to help people in poor countries,

28:05.280 --> 28:06.880
 that would also be a good thing.

28:06.880 --> 28:10.680
 And then of course, we still need to make better drugs

28:10.680 --> 28:12.360
 for so many diseases.

28:12.360 --> 28:14.200
 I mean, cancer, diabetes.

28:14.200 --> 28:17.680
 I mean, there's heart disease and rare diseases.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.360
 There are many, many situations where it'd be great

28:20.360 --> 28:22.880
 if we could do better and help more people.

28:22.880 --> 28:27.760
 Can we talk about another exciting space,

28:27.760 --> 28:29.520
 which is tissue engineering?

28:29.520 --> 28:32.360
 What is tissue engineering or regenerative medicine?

28:32.360 --> 28:35.440
 Yeah, so that tissue engineering or regenerative medicine

28:35.440 --> 28:38.880
 have to do with building an organ or tissue from scratch.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.880
 So someday maybe we can build a liver

28:43.080 --> 28:47.360
 or make new cartilage and also would enable you

28:47.360 --> 28:49.960
 to someday create organs on a chip,

28:49.960 --> 28:52.520
 which we and others are trying to do,

28:52.520 --> 28:54.520
 which might lead to better drug testing

28:54.520 --> 28:57.920
 and maybe less testing on animals or people.

28:57.920 --> 29:01.240
 Organs on a chip, that sounds fascinating.

29:01.240 --> 29:06.120
 So what are the various ways to generate tissue?

29:06.120 --> 29:08.320
 And how do, so is it, you know,

29:08.320 --> 29:10.600
 the one is of course from stem cells.

29:10.600 --> 29:11.960
 Is there other methods?

29:11.960 --> 29:14.240
 What are the different possible flavors here?

29:14.240 --> 29:17.440
 Yeah, well, I think, I mean, there's multiple components.

29:17.440 --> 29:19.800
 One is having generally some type of scaffold.

29:19.800 --> 29:23.800
 That's what Jay Vacanti and I started many, many years ago.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.160
 And then on that scaffold,

29:26.160 --> 29:28.360
 you might put different cell types,

29:28.360 --> 29:30.600
 which could be a cartilage cell, a bone cell,

29:30.600 --> 29:32.640
 could be a stem cell that might differentiate

29:32.640 --> 29:35.520
 into different things, could be more than one cell.

29:35.520 --> 29:37.520
 And the scaffold, sorry to interrupt,

29:37.520 --> 29:39.680
 is kind of like a canvas that's a structure

29:39.680 --> 29:43.000
 that you can, on which the cells can grow?

29:43.000 --> 29:44.960
 I think that's a good explanation what you just did.

29:44.960 --> 29:47.840
 I'll have to use that, the canvas, that's good.

29:47.840 --> 29:49.600
 Yeah, so I think that that's fair.

29:49.600 --> 29:52.600
 You know, and the chip could be such a canvas.

29:52.600 --> 29:55.440
 Could be fibers that are made of plastics

29:55.440 --> 29:57.080
 that you'd put in the body someday.

29:57.080 --> 29:59.840
 And when you say chip, do you mean electronic chip?

29:59.840 --> 30:00.680
 Like a...

30:00.680 --> 30:02.160
 Not necessarily, it could be though.

30:02.160 --> 30:04.820
 But it doesn't have to be, it could just be a structure

30:04.820 --> 30:08.400
 that's not in vivo, so to speak,

30:08.400 --> 30:10.920
 that's, you know, that's outside the body.

30:10.920 --> 30:11.760
 So is there...

30:11.760 --> 30:13.280
 Canvas is not a bad word.

30:13.280 --> 30:18.280
 So is there a possibility to weave into this canvas

30:20.200 --> 30:22.160
 a computational component?

30:22.160 --> 30:23.880
 So if we talk about electronic chips,

30:23.880 --> 30:28.000
 some ability to sense, control,

30:28.000 --> 30:31.320
 some aspect of this growth process for the tissue.

30:31.320 --> 30:33.340
 I would say the answer to that is yes.

30:33.340 --> 30:36.760
 I think right now people are working mostly

30:36.760 --> 30:40.660
 on validating these kinds of chips for saying,

30:40.660 --> 30:43.560
 well, it does work as effectively,

30:43.560 --> 30:47.220
 or hopefully as just putting something in the body.

30:47.220 --> 30:49.380
 But I think someday what you suggested,

30:49.380 --> 30:51.240
 you certainly would be possible.

30:51.240 --> 30:53.600
 So what kind of tissues can we engineer today?

30:53.600 --> 30:54.440
 What would, yeah.

30:54.440 --> 30:57.200
 Yeah, well, so skin's already been made

30:57.200 --> 30:58.780
 and approved by the FDA.

30:58.780 --> 31:00.860
 There are advanced clinical trials,

31:00.860 --> 31:03.020
 like what are called phase three trials,

31:03.020 --> 31:05.440
 that are at complete or near completion

31:05.440 --> 31:08.360
 for making new blood vessels.

31:08.360 --> 31:10.480
 One of my former students, Laura Nicholson,

31:10.480 --> 31:11.620
 led a lot of that.

31:13.240 --> 31:14.160
 Oh, that's amazing.

31:14.160 --> 31:16.240
 So human skin can be grown.

31:16.240 --> 31:20.480
 That's already approved in the entire, the FDA process.

31:20.480 --> 31:22.380
 So that means what,

31:23.600 --> 31:27.920
 so one, that means you can grow that tissue

31:27.920 --> 31:30.040
 and do various kinds of experiments

31:30.040 --> 31:34.200
 in terms of drugs and so on.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.760
 But what does that, does that mean

31:35.760 --> 31:38.040
 that some kind of healing and treatment

31:38.040 --> 31:41.240
 of different conditions for unhuman beings?

31:41.240 --> 31:43.560
 Yes, I mean, they've been approved now for,

31:43.560 --> 31:45.180
 I mean, different groups have made them,

31:45.180 --> 31:47.620
 different companies and different professors,

31:47.620 --> 31:50.600
 but they've been approved for burn victims

31:50.600 --> 31:53.240
 and for patients with diabetic skin ulcers.

31:53.240 --> 31:54.080
 That's amazing.

31:54.960 --> 31:59.540
 Okay, so skin, what else?

31:59.540 --> 32:01.940
 Well, at different stages,

32:01.940 --> 32:05.240
 people are, like skin, blood vessels,

32:05.240 --> 32:08.580
 there's clinical trials going now for helping patients

32:08.580 --> 32:12.320
 hear better, for patients that might be paralyzed,

32:12.320 --> 32:15.480
 for patients that have different eye problems.

32:15.480 --> 32:18.400
 I mean, and different groups have worked on

32:18.400 --> 32:20.840
 just about everything, new liver, new kidneys.

32:20.840 --> 32:24.480
 I mean, there've been all kinds of work done in this area.

32:24.480 --> 32:26.680
 Some of it's early, but there's certainly

32:26.680 --> 32:27.680
 a lot of activity.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.300
 What about neural tissue?

32:30.300 --> 32:31.480
 Yeah.

32:31.480 --> 32:34.160
 The nervous system and even the brain.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.200
 Well, there've been people out of working on that too.

32:36.200 --> 32:37.440
 We've done a little bit with that,

32:37.440 --> 32:40.360
 but there are people who've done a lot on neural stem cells

32:40.360 --> 32:43.280
 and I know Evan Snyder, who's been one of our collaborators

32:43.280 --> 32:46.200
 on some of our spinal cord works done work like that

32:46.200 --> 32:48.040
 and there've been other people as well.

32:48.040 --> 32:51.120
 Is there challenges for the,

32:51.120 --> 32:52.800
 when it is part of the human body,

32:52.800 --> 32:55.780
 is there challenges to getting the body to accept

32:55.780 --> 32:58.040
 this new tissue that's being generated?

32:58.040 --> 33:00.120
 How do you solve that kind of challenge?

33:00.120 --> 33:02.780
 There can be problems with accepting it.

33:02.780 --> 33:04.600
 I think maybe in particular,

33:04.600 --> 33:07.160
 you might mean rejection by the body.

33:07.160 --> 33:09.340
 So there are multiple ways that people are trying

33:09.340 --> 33:10.180
 to deal with that.

33:10.180 --> 33:14.680
 One way is, which was what we've done with Dan Anderson,

33:14.680 --> 33:16.060
 who was one of my former postdocs

33:16.060 --> 33:19.520
 and I mentioned this a little bit before for a pancreas,

33:19.520 --> 33:20.840
 is encapsulating the cells.

33:20.840 --> 33:25.840
 So immune cells or antibodies can't get in and attack them.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.920
 So that's a way to protect them.

33:28.920 --> 33:33.920
 Other strategies could be making the cells non immunogenic,

33:34.240 --> 33:36.960
 which might be done by different either techniques

33:36.960 --> 33:40.760
 which might mask them or using some gene editing approaches.

33:40.760 --> 33:42.160
 So there are different ways that people

33:42.160 --> 33:43.600
 are trying to do that.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.560
 And of course, if you use the patient's own cells

33:45.560 --> 33:50.240
 or cells from a close relative, that might be another way.

33:50.240 --> 33:52.720
 It increases the likelihood that it'll get accepted

33:52.720 --> 33:54.440
 if you use the patient's own cells.

33:54.440 --> 33:55.320
 Yes.

33:55.320 --> 33:57.700
 And then finally, there's immunosuppressive drugs,

33:57.700 --> 34:00.320
 which will suppress the immune response.

34:00.320 --> 34:03.940
 That's right now what's done, say, for a liver transplant.

34:03.940 --> 34:06.240
 The fact that this whole thing works is fascinating,

34:06.240 --> 34:09.880
 at least from my outside perspective.

34:09.880 --> 34:13.220
 Will we one day be able to regenerate any organ

34:13.220 --> 34:15.640
 or part of the human body?

34:15.640 --> 34:16.880
 Any of you?

34:16.880 --> 34:19.400
 I mean, it's exciting to think about future possibilities

34:19.400 --> 34:20.680
 of tissue engineering.

34:22.720 --> 34:25.100
 Do you see some tissues more difficult than others?

34:25.100 --> 34:27.000
 What are the possibilities here?

34:27.000 --> 34:29.160
 Yeah, well, of course, I'm an optimist.

34:29.160 --> 34:30.760
 And I also feel the timeframe,

34:30.760 --> 34:32.320
 if we're talking about someday,

34:32.320 --> 34:33.860
 someday could be hundreds of years.

34:33.860 --> 34:36.080
 But I think that, yes, someday,

34:36.080 --> 34:39.280
 I think we will be able to regenerate many things.

34:39.280 --> 34:41.840
 And there are different strategies that one might use.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.840
 One might use some cells themselves.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.600
 One might use some molecules

34:47.600 --> 34:49.700
 that might help regenerate the cells.

34:49.700 --> 34:51.920
 And so I think there are different possibilities.

34:51.920 --> 34:54.720
 What do you think that means for longevity?

34:54.720 --> 34:59.720
 If we look maybe not someday, but 10, 20 years out,

35:00.000 --> 35:01.840
 the possibilities of tissue engineering,

35:01.840 --> 35:04.440
 the possibilities of the research that you're doing,

35:04.440 --> 35:06.800
 does it have a significant impact

35:06.800 --> 35:10.040
 on the longevity of human life?

35:10.040 --> 35:11.120
 I don't know that we'll see

35:11.120 --> 35:12.800
 a radical increase in longevity,

35:12.800 --> 35:15.900
 but I think that in certain areas,

35:15.900 --> 35:19.420
 we'll see people live better lives

35:19.420 --> 35:21.700
 and maybe somewhat longer lives.

35:21.700 --> 35:25.740
 What's the most beautiful scientific idea

35:25.740 --> 35:28.220
 in bioengineering that you've come across

35:28.220 --> 35:29.820
 in your years of research?

35:30.740 --> 35:33.460
 I apologize for the romantic question.

35:33.460 --> 35:35.460
 No, that's an interesting question.

35:35.460 --> 35:37.900
 I certainly think what's happening right now

35:37.900 --> 35:39.580
 with CRISPR is a beautiful idea.

35:39.580 --> 35:42.100
 That certainly wasn't my idea.

35:42.100 --> 35:45.980
 I mean, but I think it's very interesting here

35:45.980 --> 35:48.820
 what people have capitalized on

35:48.820 --> 35:52.980
 is that there's a mechanism by which bacteria

35:52.980 --> 35:54.780
 are able to destroy viruses.

35:54.780 --> 35:58.620
 And that understanding that leads to machinery

35:58.620 --> 36:03.620
 to sort of cut and paste genes and fix a cell.

36:06.860 --> 36:09.380
 So that kind of, do you see a promise

36:09.380 --> 36:13.700
 for that kind of ability to copy and paste?

36:13.700 --> 36:16.860
 I mean, like we said, the human body is complicated.

36:16.860 --> 36:21.860
 Is that, that seems exceptionally difficult to do.

36:23.260 --> 36:25.220
 I think it is exceptionally difficult to do,

36:25.220 --> 36:27.940
 but that doesn't mean that it won't be done.

36:27.940 --> 36:30.460
 There's a lot of companies and people trying to do it.

36:30.460 --> 36:32.500
 And I think in some areas it will be done.

36:32.500 --> 36:36.300
 Some of the ways that you might lower the bar

36:36.300 --> 36:38.260
 are not, are just taking,

36:39.180 --> 36:40.900
 like not necessarily doing it directly,

36:40.900 --> 36:45.780
 but you could take a cell that might be useful,

36:45.780 --> 36:48.740
 but you want to give it some cancer killing capabilities,

36:48.740 --> 36:50.980
 something like what's called a CAR T cell.

36:50.980 --> 36:52.380
 And that might be a different way

36:52.380 --> 36:56.260
 of somehow making a CAR T cell and maybe making it better.

36:56.260 --> 36:58.460
 So there might be sort of easier things

36:58.460 --> 37:01.540
 and rather than just fixing the whole body.

37:01.540 --> 37:04.100
 So the way a lot of things have moved with medicine

37:04.100 --> 37:06.140
 over time is stepwise.

37:06.140 --> 37:10.260
 So I can see things that might be easier to do

37:10.260 --> 37:11.860
 than say, fix a brain.

37:11.860 --> 37:13.940
 That would be very hard to do,

37:13.940 --> 37:16.420
 but maybe someday that'll happen too.

37:16.420 --> 37:19.260
 So in terms of stepwise, that's an interesting notion.

37:19.260 --> 37:24.100
 Do you see that if you look at medicine or bioengineering,

37:25.180 --> 37:29.140
 do you see that there is these big leaps

37:29.140 --> 37:33.460
 that happen every decade or so, or some distant period,

37:33.460 --> 37:36.500
 or is it a lot of incremental work?

37:36.500 --> 37:39.020
 Not, I don't mean to reduce its impact

37:39.020 --> 37:40.060
 by saying it's incremental,

37:40.060 --> 37:45.060
 but is there sort of phase shifts in the science,

37:46.300 --> 37:48.220
 big leaps?

37:48.220 --> 37:49.700
 I think there's both.

37:49.700 --> 37:53.020
 Every so often a new technique or a new technology comes out.

37:54.300 --> 37:56.660
 I mean, genetic engineering was an example.

37:56.660 --> 37:58.820
 I mentioned CRISPR.

37:58.820 --> 38:01.300
 I think every so often things happen

38:01.300 --> 38:03.340
 that make a big difference,

38:03.340 --> 38:07.580
 but still there's to try to really make progress,

38:07.580 --> 38:09.820
 make a new drug, make a new device.

38:09.820 --> 38:11.100
 There's a lot of things.

38:11.100 --> 38:12.740
 I don't know if I'd call them incremental,

38:12.740 --> 38:15.780
 but there's a lot, a lot of work that needs to be done.

38:15.780 --> 38:16.940
 Absolutely.

38:16.940 --> 38:20.900
 So you have over, numbers could be off,

38:20.900 --> 38:22.020
 but it's a big amount.

38:22.020 --> 38:25.340
 You have over 1,100 current or pending patents

38:25.340 --> 38:27.260
 that have been licensed, sublicensed

38:27.260 --> 38:28.740
 to over 300 companies.

38:29.660 --> 38:33.980
 What's your view, what in your view are the strengths

38:33.980 --> 38:36.660
 and what are the drawbacks of the patenting process?

38:36.660 --> 38:39.260
 Well, I think for the most part, there's strengths.

38:39.260 --> 38:42.220
 I think that if you didn't have patents,

38:42.220 --> 38:43.540
 especially in medicine,

38:43.540 --> 38:45.940
 you'd never get the funding that it takes

38:45.940 --> 38:47.660
 to make a new drug or a new device.

38:47.660 --> 38:49.420
 I mean, which according to Tufts,

38:49.420 --> 38:52.700
 to make a new drug costs over $2 billion right now.

38:52.700 --> 38:55.780
 And nobody would even come close to giving you that money,

38:55.780 --> 39:00.780
 any of that money, if it weren't for the patent system,

39:00.780 --> 39:03.100
 because then anybody else could do it.

39:03.100 --> 39:08.100
 That then leads to the negative though.

39:08.300 --> 39:11.860
 Sometimes somebody does have a very successful drug

39:11.860 --> 39:14.380
 and you certainly wanna try to make it available

39:14.380 --> 39:15.860
 to everybody.

39:15.860 --> 39:20.860
 And so the patent system allowed it to happen

39:21.140 --> 39:23.820
 in the first place, but maybe it'll impede it

39:23.820 --> 39:26.700
 after a little bit, or certainly to some people

39:26.700 --> 39:31.220
 or to some companies, once it is out there.

39:31.220 --> 39:34.660
 What's the, on the point of the cost,

39:34.660 --> 39:37.620
 what would you say is the most expensive part

39:37.620 --> 39:40.980
 of the $2 billion of making a drug?

39:40.980 --> 39:42.900
 Human clinical trials.

39:42.900 --> 39:44.620
 That is by far the most expensive.

39:44.620 --> 39:47.540
 In terms of money or pain or both?

39:47.540 --> 39:50.660
 Well, money, but pain goes, it's hard to know.

39:50.660 --> 39:54.140
 I mean, but usually proving things that are,

39:54.140 --> 39:57.740
 proving that something new is safe and effective in people

39:57.740 --> 40:00.420
 is almost always the biggest expense.

40:00.420 --> 40:02.740
 Could you linger on that for just a little longer

40:02.740 --> 40:06.300
 and describe what it takes to prove,

40:06.300 --> 40:09.580
 for people that don't know, in general,

40:09.580 --> 40:12.940
 what it takes to prove that something is effective on humans?

40:12.940 --> 40:17.660
 Well, you'd have to take a particular disease,

40:17.660 --> 40:20.460
 but the process is you start out with,

40:20.460 --> 40:21.980
 usually you start out with cells,

40:21.980 --> 40:23.420
 then you'd go to animal models.

40:23.420 --> 40:25.780
 Usually you have to do a couple animal models.

40:25.780 --> 40:28.660
 And of course the animal models aren't perfect for humans.

40:28.660 --> 40:31.060
 And then you have to do three sets of clinical trials

40:31.060 --> 40:34.140
 at a minimum, a phase one trial to show that it's safe

40:34.140 --> 40:36.580
 in small number of patients, a phase two trial

40:36.580 --> 40:39.220
 to show that it's effective in a small number of patients,

40:39.220 --> 40:42.500
 and a phase three trial to show that it's safe and effective

40:42.500 --> 40:44.540
 in a large number of patients.

40:44.540 --> 40:46.900
 And that could end up being hundreds

40:46.900 --> 40:49.260
 or thousands of patients.

40:49.260 --> 40:52.620
 And they have to be really carefully controlled studies.

40:52.620 --> 40:55.060
 And you'd have to manufacture the drug,

40:55.060 --> 40:58.860
 you'd have to really watch those patients.

40:58.860 --> 41:03.140
 You have to be very concerned that it is gonna be safe.

41:03.140 --> 41:07.500
 And then you look and see, does it treat the disease better

41:07.500 --> 41:10.860
 than whatever the gold standard was before that?

41:10.860 --> 41:12.780
 Assuming there was one.

41:12.780 --> 41:14.420
 That's a really interesting line.

41:14.420 --> 41:17.980
 Show that it's safe first, and then that it's effective.

41:17.980 --> 41:19.220
 First do no harm.

41:19.220 --> 41:21.380
 First do no harm, that's right.

41:21.380 --> 41:26.140
 So how, again, if you can linger in a little bit,

41:26.140 --> 41:28.260
 how does the patenting process work?

41:29.140 --> 41:32.660
 Yeah, well, you do a certain amount of research,

41:32.660 --> 41:35.300
 though that's not necessarily has to be the case.

41:35.300 --> 41:36.820
 But for us, usually it is.

41:36.820 --> 41:39.100
 Usually we do a certain amount of research

41:40.420 --> 41:41.860
 and make some findings.

41:41.860 --> 41:46.380
 And we had a hypothesis, let's say we prove it,

41:46.380 --> 41:49.580
 or we make some discovery, we invent some technique.

41:49.580 --> 41:52.940
 And then we write something up, what's called a disclosure.

41:52.940 --> 41:55.620
 We give it to MIT's technology transfer office.

41:55.620 --> 41:57.820
 They then give it to some patent attorneys,

41:57.820 --> 42:00.900
 and they use that plus talking to us

42:00.900 --> 42:03.740
 and work on writing a patent.

42:03.740 --> 42:07.700
 And then you go back and forth with the USPTO,

42:07.700 --> 42:09.900
 that's the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

42:09.900 --> 42:14.340
 And they may not allow it the first, second or third time,

42:14.340 --> 42:17.140
 but they will tell you why they don't.

42:17.140 --> 42:18.180
 And you may adjust it,

42:18.180 --> 42:21.540
 and maybe you'll eventually get it, and maybe you won't.

42:21.540 --> 42:24.980
 So you've been part of launching 40 companies

42:24.980 --> 42:28.500
 together worth, again, numbers could be outdated,

42:28.500 --> 42:30.780
 but an estimated $23 billion.

42:33.260 --> 42:34.700
 You've described your thoughts

42:34.700 --> 42:36.980
 on a formula for startup success.

42:36.980 --> 42:38.940
 So perhaps you can describe that formula

42:38.940 --> 42:41.540
 and in general describe what does it take

42:41.540 --> 42:43.260
 to build a successful startup?

42:44.180 --> 42:46.540
 Well, I'd break that down into a couple of categories.

42:46.540 --> 42:48.660
 And I'm a scientist and certainly

42:48.660 --> 42:50.700
 from the science standpoint, I'll go over that.

42:50.700 --> 42:54.180
 But I actually think that really the most important thing

42:54.180 --> 42:57.660
 is probably the business people that I work with.

42:57.660 --> 43:01.580
 And when I look back at the companies that have done well,

43:01.580 --> 43:03.860
 it's been because we've had great business people.

43:03.860 --> 43:05.220
 And when they haven't done as well,

43:05.220 --> 43:06.940
 we haven't had as good business people.

43:06.940 --> 43:08.820
 But from a science standpoint,

43:08.820 --> 43:11.460
 I think about that we've made some kind of discovery

43:12.540 --> 43:15.340
 that is almost what I'd call a platform

43:15.340 --> 43:17.860
 that you could use it for different things.

43:17.860 --> 43:20.540
 And certainly the drug delivery system example

43:20.540 --> 43:22.660
 that I gave earlier is a good example of that.

43:22.660 --> 43:25.660
 You could use it for drug A, B, C, D, E and so forth.

43:27.100 --> 43:30.420
 And that I'd like to think that we've taken it far enough

43:30.420 --> 43:33.300
 so that we've written at least one really good paper

43:33.300 --> 43:35.420
 in a top journal, hopefully a number

43:36.340 --> 43:39.340
 that we've reduced it to practice and animal models

43:39.340 --> 43:44.340
 that we've filed patents, maybe had issued patents

43:45.380 --> 43:48.340
 that have what I'll call very good and broad claims.

43:48.340 --> 43:50.860
 That's sort of the key on a patent.

43:50.860 --> 43:54.180
 And then in our case, a lot of times when we've done it,

43:55.020 --> 43:57.780
 a lot of times it's somebody in the lab

43:57.780 --> 43:59.380
 like a postdoc or graduate student

43:59.380 --> 44:01.740
 that spent a big part of their life doing it

44:01.740 --> 44:03.740
 and that they wanna work at that company

44:03.740 --> 44:04.780
 because they have this passion

44:04.780 --> 44:06.580
 that they wanna see something they did

44:06.580 --> 44:09.380
 make a difference in people's lives.

44:09.380 --> 44:12.980
 Maybe you can mention the business component.

44:12.980 --> 44:15.300
 It's funny to hear Grace had to say

44:15.300 --> 44:17.940
 that there's value to business folks.

44:17.940 --> 44:18.780
 Oh yeah, well.

44:18.780 --> 44:20.420
 That's not always said.

44:20.420 --> 44:25.220
 So what value, what business instinct is valuable

44:25.220 --> 44:29.180
 to make a startup successful, a company successful?

44:29.180 --> 44:32.180
 I think the business aspects are,

44:32.180 --> 44:35.740
 you have to be a good judge of people

44:35.740 --> 44:37.700
 so that you hire the right people.

44:37.700 --> 44:40.460
 You have to be strategic so you figure out

44:40.460 --> 44:41.820
 if you do have that platform

44:41.820 --> 44:44.700
 that could be used for all these different things.

44:44.700 --> 44:47.620
 And knowing that medical research is so expensive,

44:47.620 --> 44:49.180
 what thing are you gonna do first, second,

44:49.180 --> 44:51.980
 third, fourth and fifth?

44:51.980 --> 44:53.660
 I think you need to have a good,

44:53.660 --> 44:57.220
 what I'll call FDA regulatory clinical trial strategy.

44:58.100 --> 45:01.580
 I think you have to be able to raise money incredibly.

45:01.580 --> 45:02.740
 So there are a lot of things.

45:02.740 --> 45:05.260
 You have to be good with people, good manager of people.

45:05.260 --> 45:08.460
 So the money and the people part I get,

45:08.460 --> 45:13.020
 but the stuff before in terms of deciding the A, B, C, D,

45:13.020 --> 45:16.660
 if you have a platform which drugs to first take a testing,

45:16.660 --> 45:18.900
 you see nevertheless scientists

45:18.900 --> 45:22.580
 as not being always too good at that process.

45:22.580 --> 45:24.260
 Well, I think they're a part of the process,

45:24.260 --> 45:28.180
 but I'd say there's probably, I'm gonna just make this up,

45:28.180 --> 45:31.780
 but maybe six or seven criteria that you wanna use

45:31.780 --> 45:33.300
 and it's not just science.

45:33.300 --> 45:35.180
 I mean, the kinds of things that I would think about

45:35.180 --> 45:37.900
 is, is the market big or small?

45:37.900 --> 45:41.260
 Is the, are there good animal models for it

45:41.260 --> 45:44.320
 so that you could test it and it wouldn't take 50 years?

45:45.560 --> 45:48.420
 Are the clinical trials that could be set up

45:48.420 --> 45:51.960
 ones that have clear end points

45:51.960 --> 45:53.700
 where you can make a judgment?

45:53.700 --> 45:58.700
 And another issue would be competition.

45:58.860 --> 46:00.420
 Are there other ways that some companies

46:00.420 --> 46:01.540
 out there are doing it?

46:01.540 --> 46:04.860
 Another issue would be reimbursement.

46:05.820 --> 46:07.540
 You know, can it get reimbursed?

46:07.540 --> 46:10.180
 So a lot of things that you have manufacturing issues

46:10.180 --> 46:11.860
 you'd wanna consider.

46:11.860 --> 46:13.700
 So I think there are really a lot of things

46:13.700 --> 46:15.540
 that go into whether you,

46:15.540 --> 46:17.740
 what you do first, second, third, or fourth.

46:19.300 --> 46:23.100
 So you lead one of the largest academic labs in the world

46:23.100 --> 46:27.020
 with over $10 million in annual grants

46:27.020 --> 46:28.520
 and over a hundred researchers,

46:28.520 --> 46:31.740
 probably over a thousand since the lab's beginning.

46:31.740 --> 46:36.740
 Researchers can be individualistic and eccentric.

46:37.100 --> 46:38.580
 How do I put it nicely?

46:38.580 --> 46:40.000
 There you go, eccentric.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.140
 So what insights into research leadership can you give

46:43.140 --> 46:45.340
 having to run such a successful lab

46:45.340 --> 46:47.320
 with so much diverse talent?

46:49.440 --> 46:50.780
 Well, I don't know that I'm any expert.

46:50.780 --> 46:53.500
 I think that what you do to me,

46:53.500 --> 46:54.900
 I mean, I just want,

46:54.900 --> 46:56.380
 I mean, this is gonna sound very simplistic,

46:56.380 --> 46:58.940
 but I just want people in the lab to be happy,

46:58.940 --> 47:00.260
 to be doing things that I hope

47:00.260 --> 47:02.700
 will make the world a better place,

47:02.700 --> 47:04.460
 to be working on science

47:04.460 --> 47:06.140
 that can make the world a better place.

47:06.140 --> 47:09.820
 And I guess my feeling is if we're able to do that,

47:11.300 --> 47:13.940
 you know, it kind of runs itself.

47:13.940 --> 47:17.360
 So how do you make a researcher happy in general?

47:17.360 --> 47:19.260
 I think when people feel,

47:19.260 --> 47:21.460
 I mean, this is gonna sound like, again,

47:21.460 --> 47:23.600
 simplistic or maybe like motherhood and apple pie,

47:23.600 --> 47:26.540
 but I think if people feel they're working on something

47:26.540 --> 47:30.180
 really important that can affect many other people's lives

47:30.180 --> 47:32.600
 and they're making some progress,

47:32.600 --> 47:34.100
 they'll feel good about it

47:34.100 --> 47:35.420
 and they'll feel good about themselves

47:35.420 --> 47:37.240
 and they'll be happy.

47:37.240 --> 47:39.820
 But through brainstorming and so on,

47:39.820 --> 47:43.940
 what's your role and how difficult is it as a group

47:43.940 --> 47:48.940
 in this collaboration to arrive at these big questions

47:49.420 --> 47:51.100
 that might have impact?

47:51.100 --> 47:54.620
 Well, the big questions come from many different ways.

47:54.620 --> 47:57.420
 Sometimes it's trying to, things that I might think of

47:57.420 --> 47:59.500
 or somebody in the lab might think of,

47:59.500 --> 48:00.900
 which could be a new technique

48:00.900 --> 48:02.900
 or to understand something better.

48:02.900 --> 48:05.560
 But gee, we've had people like Bill Gates

48:05.560 --> 48:07.180
 and the Gates Foundation come to us

48:07.180 --> 48:10.140
 and Juvenile Diabetes Foundation come to us and say,

48:10.140 --> 48:11.740
 gee, could you help us on these things?

48:11.740 --> 48:13.540
 And I mean, that's good too.

48:13.540 --> 48:15.500
 It doesn't happen just one way.

48:16.900 --> 48:20.800
 And I mean, you've kind of mentioned it, happiness,

48:20.800 --> 48:24.720
 but is there something more,

48:24.720 --> 48:26.440
 how do you inspire a researcher

48:26.440 --> 48:28.300
 to do the best work of their life?

48:28.300 --> 48:32.660
 So you mentioned passion and passion is a kind of fire.

48:32.660 --> 48:35.980
 Do you see yourself having a role to keep that fire going,

48:35.980 --> 48:39.900
 to build it up, to inspire the researchers

48:39.900 --> 48:42.840
 through the pretty difficult process

48:42.840 --> 48:47.840
 of going from idea to big question, to big answer?

48:47.840 --> 48:48.680
 I think so.

48:48.680 --> 48:52.680
 I think I try to do that by talking to people

48:52.680 --> 48:56.840
 going over their ideas and their progress.

48:56.840 --> 49:00.000
 I try to do it as an individual.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.880
 Certainly when I talk about my own career,

49:01.880 --> 49:04.640
 I had my setbacks at different times

49:04.640 --> 49:06.920
 and people know that, that know me.

49:06.920 --> 49:11.920
 And you just try to keep pushing and so forth.

49:12.080 --> 49:15.760
 But yeah, I think I try to do that.

49:15.760 --> 49:17.920
 But yeah, I think I try to do that

49:17.920 --> 49:20.960
 as the one who leads the lab.

49:20.960 --> 49:23.320
 So you have this exceptionally successful lab

49:23.320 --> 49:27.400
 and one of the great institutions in the world, MIT.

49:29.280 --> 49:32.680
 And yet sort of, at least in my neck of the woods

49:32.680 --> 49:35.220
 in computer science and artificial intelligence,

49:36.560 --> 49:39.680
 a lot of the research is kind of,

49:40.520 --> 49:43.060
 a lot of the great researchers, not everyone,

49:43.060 --> 49:46.920
 but some are kind of going to industry.

49:46.920 --> 49:49.680
 A lot of the research is moving to industry.

49:49.680 --> 49:52.600
 What do you think about the future of science in general?

49:52.600 --> 49:54.440
 Is there drawbacks?

49:54.440 --> 49:57.080
 Is there strength to the academic environment

49:58.200 --> 49:59.920
 that you hope will persist?

49:59.920 --> 50:02.120
 How does it need to change?

50:02.120 --> 50:04.200
 What needs to stay the same?

50:04.200 --> 50:05.920
 What are your thoughts on this whole landscape

50:05.920 --> 50:08.000
 of science and its future?

50:08.000 --> 50:10.400
 Well, first I think going to industry is good,

50:10.400 --> 50:12.840
 but I think being in academia is good.

50:12.840 --> 50:15.240
 You know, I have lots of students who've done both

50:15.240 --> 50:18.480
 and they've had great careers doing both.

50:18.480 --> 50:21.280
 I think from an academic standpoint,

50:21.280 --> 50:24.920
 I mean, the biggest concern probably that people feel today,

50:24.920 --> 50:26.560
 you know, at a place like MIT

50:26.560 --> 50:30.240
 or other research heavy institutions is gonna be funding

50:30.240 --> 50:34.060
 and particular funding that's not super directed,

50:34.060 --> 50:37.080
 you know, so that you can do basic research.

50:37.080 --> 50:39.360
 I think that's probably the number one thing,

50:39.360 --> 50:43.400
 but you know, it would be great if we as a society

50:43.400 --> 50:45.640
 could come up with better ways to teach,

50:45.640 --> 50:49.200
 you know, so that people all over could learn better.

50:50.160 --> 50:51.820
 You know, so I think there are a number of things

50:51.820 --> 50:54.020
 that would be good to be able to do better.

50:55.320 --> 50:58.900
 So again, you're very successful in terms of funding,

50:58.900 --> 51:01.980
 but do you still feel the pressure of that,

51:01.980 --> 51:04.640
 of having to seek funding?

51:04.640 --> 51:07.420
 Does it affect the science or is it,

51:07.420 --> 51:11.260
 or can you simply focus on doing the best work of your life

51:11.260 --> 51:14.040
 and the funding comes along with that?

51:14.040 --> 51:16.240
 I'd say the last 10 or 15 years,

51:16.240 --> 51:18.460
 we've done pretty well funding,

51:18.460 --> 51:19.760
 but I always worry about it.

51:19.760 --> 51:23.640
 You know, it's like you're still operating

51:23.640 --> 51:25.860
 on more soft money than hard.

51:25.860 --> 51:27.760
 And so I always worry about it,

51:27.760 --> 51:32.760
 but we've been fortunate that places have come to us

51:33.000 --> 51:34.880
 like the Gates Foundation and others,

51:34.880 --> 51:37.600
 Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, some companies,

51:37.600 --> 51:39.760
 and they're willing to give us funding

51:39.760 --> 51:42.200
 and we've gotten government money as well.

51:42.200 --> 51:44.760
 We have a number of NIH grants and I've always had that

51:44.760 --> 51:47.180
 and that's important to me too.

51:47.180 --> 51:51.480
 So I worry about it, but you know,

51:51.480 --> 51:53.760
 I just view that as a part of the process.

51:53.760 --> 51:57.440
 Now, if you put yourself in the shoes of a philanthropist,

51:57.440 --> 52:02.200
 like say I gave you $100 billion right now,

52:02.200 --> 52:05.560
 but you couldn't spend it on your own research.

52:05.560 --> 52:10.560
 So how hard is it to decide which labs to invest in,

52:12.800 --> 52:16.460
 which ideas, which problems, which solutions?

52:16.460 --> 52:19.120
 You know, cause funding is so much,

52:19.120 --> 52:22.960
 such an important part of progression of science

52:22.960 --> 52:24.560
 in today's society.

52:24.560 --> 52:26.720
 So if you put yourself in the shoes of a philanthropist,

52:26.720 --> 52:27.560
 how hard is that problem?

52:27.560 --> 52:29.320
 How would you go about solving it?

52:29.320 --> 52:32.400
 Sure, well, I think what I do, the first thing is different

52:32.400 --> 52:34.760
 philanthropists have different visions.

52:34.760 --> 52:37.620
 And I think the first thing is to form a concrete vision

52:37.620 --> 52:38.460
 of what you want.

52:38.460 --> 52:41.100
 Some people, I mean, I'll just give you two examples

52:41.100 --> 52:44.320
 of people that I know.

52:44.320 --> 52:47.480
 David Koch was very interested in cancer research

52:47.480 --> 52:51.640
 and part of that was that he had prostate cancer.

52:51.640 --> 52:55.440
 And a number of people do that along those lines.

52:55.440 --> 52:57.960
 They've had somebody, they've either had cancer themselves

52:57.960 --> 53:00.000
 or somebody they loved had cancer

53:00.000 --> 53:02.700
 and they wanna put money into cancer research.

53:02.700 --> 53:04.160
 Bill Gates, on the other hand,

53:04.160 --> 53:06.480
 I think when he had got his fortune,

53:06.480 --> 53:08.560
 I mean, he thought about it and felt, well,

53:08.560 --> 53:10.180
 how could he have the greatest impact?

53:10.180 --> 53:12.520
 And he thought about, you know, helping people

53:12.520 --> 53:15.660
 in the developing world and medicines

53:15.660 --> 53:18.040
 and different things like that, like vaccines

53:18.040 --> 53:20.160
 that might be really helpful for people

53:20.160 --> 53:21.120
 in the developing world.

53:21.120 --> 53:25.720
 And so I think first you start out with that vision.

53:25.720 --> 53:29.440
 Once you start out with that vision, whatever vision it is,

53:29.440 --> 53:33.760
 then I think you try to ask the question,

53:33.760 --> 53:38.360
 who in the world does the best work if that was your goal?

53:38.360 --> 53:40.240
 I mean, but you really, I think have to have

53:40.240 --> 53:41.060
 a defined vision.

53:41.060 --> 53:41.900
 Vision first.

53:41.900 --> 53:45.080
 Yeah, and I think that's what people do.

53:45.080 --> 53:48.360
 I mean, I have never seen anybody do it otherwise.

53:48.360 --> 53:49.760
 I mean, and that, by the way,

53:49.760 --> 53:53.280
 may not be the best thing overall.

53:53.280 --> 53:55.600
 I mean, I think it's good that all those things happen,

53:55.600 --> 53:57.800
 but, you know, what you really want to do,

53:57.800 --> 54:00.440
 and I'll make a contrast in a second,

54:00.440 --> 54:02.680
 in addition to funding important areas,

54:02.680 --> 54:07.680
 like what both of those people did, is to help young people.

54:07.760 --> 54:10.120
 And they may be at odds with each other

54:10.120 --> 54:13.080
 because a far more, a lab like ours,

54:13.080 --> 54:15.680
 which is, you know, I'm older, is, you know,

54:15.680 --> 54:18.680
 might be very good at addressing some of those kinds

54:18.680 --> 54:20.680
 of problems, but, you know, I'm not young.

54:20.680 --> 54:22.720
 I train a lot of people who are young,

54:22.720 --> 54:24.480
 but it's not the same as helping somebody

54:24.480 --> 54:26.480
 who's an assistant professor someplace.

54:26.480 --> 54:30.960
 So I think what's, I think, been good about our thing,

54:30.960 --> 54:33.280
 our society, or things overall,

54:33.280 --> 54:35.040
 are that there are people who come at it

54:35.040 --> 54:37.840
 from different ways, and the combination,

54:37.840 --> 54:40.380
 the confluence of the government funding,

54:40.380 --> 54:43.880
 the certain foundations that fund things,

54:43.880 --> 54:46.640
 and other foundations that, you know,

54:46.640 --> 54:48.280
 want to see disease treated,

54:48.280 --> 54:51.480
 well, then they can go seek out people,

54:51.480 --> 54:53.240
 or they can put a request for proposals

54:53.240 --> 54:54.680
 and see who does the best.

54:54.680 --> 54:58.000
 You know, I'd say both David Koch and Bill Gates

54:58.000 --> 54:58.960
 did exactly that.

54:58.960 --> 55:02.200
 They sought out people, both of them, you know,

55:02.200 --> 55:04.200
 or their foundations that they were involved in,

55:04.200 --> 55:05.820
 sought out people like myself.

55:07.480 --> 55:10.220
 But they also had requests for proposals.

55:11.400 --> 55:12.720
 Now, you mentioned young people,

55:12.720 --> 55:14.160
 and that reminds me of something you said

55:14.160 --> 55:17.720
 in an interview of Written Somewhere,

55:17.720 --> 55:21.840
 that said some of your initial struggles

55:21.840 --> 55:26.660
 in terms of finding a faculty position, or so on,

55:28.200 --> 55:30.120
 that you didn't quite, for people,

55:30.120 --> 55:33.000
 fit into a particular bucket, a particular.

55:33.000 --> 55:33.840
 Right.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.320
 Can you speak to that?

55:38.240 --> 55:41.760
 How, do you see limitations to the academic system

55:41.760 --> 55:44.120
 that it does have such buckets?

55:44.120 --> 55:49.120
 Is there, how can we allow for people

55:49.120 --> 55:54.120
 who are brilliant, but outside the disciplines

55:56.400 --> 55:59.600
 of the previous decade?

55:59.600 --> 56:01.320
 Yeah, well, I think that's a great question.

56:01.320 --> 56:03.620
 I think that, I think the department heads

56:03.620 --> 56:07.040
 have to have a vision, you know, and some of them do.

56:07.040 --> 56:11.040
 Every so often, you know, there are institutes

56:11.040 --> 56:13.400
 or labs that do that.

56:13.400 --> 56:17.480
 I mean, at MIT, I think that's done sometimes.

56:17.480 --> 56:21.240
 I know mechanical engineering department just had a search,

56:21.240 --> 56:25.440
 and they hired Gio Traverso, who is one of my,

56:25.440 --> 56:28.200
 he was a fellow with me, but he's actually

56:28.200 --> 56:32.000
 a molecular biologist and a gastroenterologist.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.200
 And, you know, he's one of the best in the world,

56:34.200 --> 56:37.240
 but he's also done some great mechanical engineering

56:37.240 --> 56:39.800
 and designing some new pills and things like that.

56:39.800 --> 56:43.880
 And they picked him, and boy, I give them a lot of credit.

56:43.880 --> 56:46.880
 I mean, that's vision, to pick somebody.

56:46.880 --> 56:49.880
 And I think, you know, they'll be the richer four.

56:49.880 --> 56:52.120
 I think the Media Lab has certainly hired, you know,

56:52.120 --> 56:55.400
 people like Ed Boyden and others who have done,

56:55.400 --> 56:56.820
 you know, very different things.

56:56.820 --> 57:00.480
 And so I think that, you know, that's part of the vision

57:00.480 --> 57:03.560
 of the leadership who do things like that.

57:03.560 --> 57:07.320
 Do you think one day, you've mentioned David Koch and cancer,

57:07.320 --> 57:10.520
 do you think one day we'll cure cancer?

57:10.520 --> 57:12.240
 Yeah, I mean, of course, one day,

57:12.240 --> 57:14.280
 I don't know how long that day will come.

57:14.280 --> 57:15.120
 Soon.

57:15.120 --> 57:17.520
 Yeah, soon, soon, no, but I think.

57:17.520 --> 57:19.200
 So you think it is a grand challenge,

57:19.200 --> 57:20.120
 it is a grand challenge,

57:20.120 --> 57:22.680
 it's not just solvable within a few years.

57:22.680 --> 57:24.460
 No, I don't think very many things

57:24.460 --> 57:25.940
 are solvable in a few years.

57:25.940 --> 57:28.580
 There's some good ideas that people are working on,

57:28.580 --> 57:31.100
 but I mean, all cancers, that's pretty tough.

57:32.160 --> 57:35.000
 If we do get the cure, what will the cure look like?

57:35.000 --> 57:37.260
 Do you think which mechanisms,

57:37.260 --> 57:40.200
 which disciplines will help us arrive at that cure

57:40.200 --> 57:42.680
 from all the amazing work you've done

57:42.680 --> 57:44.000
 that has touched on cancer?

57:44.000 --> 57:45.520
 No, I think it'll be a combination

57:45.520 --> 57:46.800
 of biology and engineering.

57:46.800 --> 57:50.440
 I think it'll be biology to understand

57:50.440 --> 57:54.040
 the right genetic mechanisms to solve this problem

57:54.040 --> 57:56.400
 and maybe the right immunological mechanisms

57:56.400 --> 58:00.400
 and engineering in the sense of producing the molecules,

58:00.400 --> 58:02.200
 developing the right delivery systems,

58:02.200 --> 58:04.560
 targeting it or whatever else needs to be done.

58:05.680 --> 58:08.920
 Well, that's a beautiful vision for engineering.

58:08.920 --> 58:11.880
 So on a lighter topic, I've read that you love chocolate

58:11.880 --> 58:16.880
 and mentioned two places, Ben and Bill's Chocolate Aquarium

58:16.920 --> 58:20.280
 and the chocolate cookies, the Soho Globs

58:20.280 --> 58:22.620
 from Rosie's Bakery in Chestnut Hill.

58:22.620 --> 58:25.400
 I went to their website and I was trying

58:25.400 --> 58:26.960
 to finish a paper last night.

58:26.960 --> 58:30.700
 There's a deadline today and yet I was wasting

58:30.700 --> 58:34.200
 way too much time at 3 a.m. instead of writing the paper,

58:34.200 --> 58:36.400
 staring at the Rosie Baker's cookies,

58:36.400 --> 58:38.320
 which are just look incredible.

58:38.320 --> 58:40.680
 The Soho Globs just look incredible.

58:40.680 --> 58:44.680
 But for me, oatmeal white raisin cookies won my heart

58:44.680 --> 58:46.460
 just from the pictures.

58:46.460 --> 58:49.040
 Do you think one day we'll be able to engineer

58:49.040 --> 58:52.900
 the perfect cookie with the help of chemistry

58:52.900 --> 58:55.440
 and maybe a bit of data driven artificial intelligence

58:55.440 --> 59:00.440
 or is cookies something that's more art than engineering?

59:02.480 --> 59:03.600
 I think there's some of both.

59:03.600 --> 59:06.040
 I think engineering will probably help someday.

59:06.960 --> 59:08.640
 What about chocolate?

59:08.640 --> 59:09.900
 Same thing, same thing.

59:09.900 --> 59:12.840
 You'd have to go to see some of David Edwards stuff.

59:12.840 --> 59:15.840
 He was one of my postdocs and he's a professor at Harvard

59:15.840 --> 59:18.520
 but he also started Cafe Art Sciences

59:18.520 --> 59:22.440
 and it's just a really cool restaurant around here.

59:22.440 --> 59:26.960
 But he also has companies that do ways

59:26.960 --> 59:30.360
 of looking at fragrances and trying to use engineering

59:30.360 --> 59:34.280
 in new ways and so I think that's just an example.

59:34.280 --> 59:38.200
 But I expect someday that AI and engineering

59:38.200 --> 59:40.920
 will play a role in almost everything.

59:40.920 --> 59:42.640
 Including creating the perfect cookie.

59:42.640 --> 59:43.480
 Yes.

59:43.480 --> 59:45.240
 Well, I dream of that day as well.

59:45.240 --> 59:47.760
 So when you look back at your life,

59:47.760 --> 59:50.640
 having accomplished an incredible amount of positive impact

59:50.640 --> 59:53.600
 on the world through science and engineering,

59:53.600 --> 59:56.320
 what are you most proud of?

59:56.320 --> 59:59.400
 My students, I really feel when I look at that,

59:59.400 --> 1:00:02.320
 we've probably had close to 1,000 students

1:00:02.320 --> 1:00:06.760
 go through the lab and they've done incredibly well.

1:00:06.760 --> 1:00:09.720
 I think 18 are in the National Academy of Engineering,

1:00:09.720 --> 1:00:12.280
 16 in the National Academy of Medicine.

1:00:12.280 --> 1:00:15.280
 I mean, they've been CEOs of companies,

1:00:15.280 --> 1:00:19.460
 presidents of universities and they've done,

1:00:19.460 --> 1:00:21.200
 I think eight are faculty at MIT,

1:00:21.200 --> 1:00:22.940
 maybe about 12 at Harvard.

1:00:22.940 --> 1:00:25.680
 I mean, so it really makes you feel good

1:00:25.680 --> 1:00:28.780
 to think that the people, they're not my children

1:00:28.780 --> 1:00:31.200
 but they're close to my children in a way

1:00:31.200 --> 1:00:32.720
 and it makes you feel really good

1:00:32.720 --> 1:00:34.660
 to see them have such great lives

1:00:34.660 --> 1:00:36.800
 and them do so much good and be happy.

1:00:37.760 --> 1:00:40.080
 Well, I think that's a perfect way to end it, Bob.

1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:41.160
 Thank you so much for talking to me.

1:00:41.160 --> 1:00:41.980
 My pleasure.

1:00:41.980 --> 1:00:42.820
 It was an honor.

1:00:42.820 --> 1:00:43.660
 Good questions.

1:00:43.660 --> 1:00:44.480
 Thank you.

 And now let me leave you with some words from Bill Bryson

1:01:28.080 --> 1:01:31.120
 in his book, A Short History of Nearly Everything.

1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:33.880
 If this book has a lesson,

1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:36.480
 it is that we're awfully lucky to be here.

1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:39.640
 And by we, I mean every living thing.

1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:42.500
 To attain any kind of life in this universe of ours

1:01:42.500 --> 1:01:44.800
 appears to be quite an achievement.

1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:47.460
 As humans, we're doubly lucky, of course.

1:01:47.460 --> 1:01:50.080
 We enjoy not only the privilege of existence,

1:01:50.080 --> 1:01:53.460
 but also the singular ability to appreciate it

1:01:53.460 --> 1:01:57.600
 and even in a multitude of ways to make it better.

1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:01.800
 It is talent we have only barely begun to grasp.

1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:28.800
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
