00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
 You've studied the human mind, cognition, language, vision, evolution, psychology,

00:05.280 --> 00:11.120
 from child to adult, from the level of individual to the level of our entire civilization.

00:11.680 --> 00:14.880
 So I feel like I can start with a simple multiple choice question.

00:16.240 --> 00:21.840
 What is the meaning of life? Is it A. to attain knowledge as Plato said,

00:22.400 --> 00:27.920
 B. to attain power as Nietzsche said, C. to escape death as Ernest Becker said,

00:27.920 --> 00:32.640
 D. to propagate our genes as Darwin and others have said,

00:33.200 --> 00:36.400
 E. there is no meaning as the nihilists have said,

00:37.520 --> 00:42.960
 F. knowing the meaning of life is beyond our cognitive capabilities as Stephen Pinker said,

00:42.960 --> 00:47.360
 based on my interpretation 20 years ago, and G. none of the above.

00:48.160 --> 00:51.200
 I'd say A. comes closest, but I would amend that to

00:51.200 --> 00:58.640
 C. to attaining not only knowledge but fulfillment more generally, that is life, health, stimulation,

01:00.640 --> 01:06.080
 access to the living cultural and social world.

01:06.080 --> 01:10.800
 Now this is our meaning of life. It's not the meaning of life if you were to ask our genes.

01:12.160 --> 01:17.680
 Their meaning is to propagate copies of themselves, but that is distinct from the

01:17.680 --> 01:21.600
 meaning that the brain that they lead to sets for itself.

01:22.400 --> 01:27.840
 So to you knowledge is a small subset or a large subset?

01:27.840 --> 01:34.000
 It's a large subset, but it's not the entirety of human striving because we also want to

01:35.200 --> 01:39.600
 interact with people. We want to experience beauty. We want to experience the richness

01:39.600 --> 01:47.840
 of the natural world, but understanding what makes the universe tick is way up there.

01:47.840 --> 01:54.000
 For some of us more than others, certainly for me that's one of the top five.

01:54.560 --> 02:00.080
 So is that a fundamental aspect? Are you just describing your own preference or is this a

02:00.080 --> 02:05.920
 fundamental aspect of human nature is to seek knowledge? In your latest book you talk about

02:05.920 --> 02:11.760
 the power, the usefulness of rationality and reason and so on. Is that a fundamental

02:11.760 --> 02:16.160
 nature of human beings or is it something we should just strive for?

02:17.040 --> 02:23.920
 Both. We're capable of striving for it because it is one of the things that make us what we are,

02:23.920 --> 02:32.320
 homo sapiens, wise men. We are unusual among animals in the degree to which we acquire

02:32.320 --> 02:41.600
 knowledge and use it to survive. We make tools. We strike agreements via language. We extract

02:41.600 --> 02:47.760
 poisons. We predict the behavior of animals. We try to get at the workings of plants.

02:47.760 --> 02:52.640
 And when I say we, I don't just mean we in the modern West, but we as a species everywhere,

02:52.640 --> 02:58.160
 which is how we've managed to occupy every niche on the planet, how we've managed to drive other

02:58.160 --> 03:06.480
 animals to extinction. And the refinement of reason in pursuit of human wellbeing, of health,

03:06.480 --> 03:13.680
 happiness, social richness, cultural richness is our main challenge in the present. That is

03:14.480 --> 03:19.280
 using our intellect, using our knowledge to figure out how the world works, how we work

03:19.280 --> 03:25.200
 in order to make discoveries and strike agreements that make us all better off in the long run.

03:25.200 --> 03:31.840
 Right. And you do that almost undeniably and in a data driven way in your recent book,

03:31.840 --> 03:36.400
 but I'd like to focus on the artificial intelligence aspect of things and not just

03:36.400 --> 03:41.920
 artificial intelligence, but natural intelligence too. So 20 years ago in a book you've written on

03:41.920 --> 03:49.520
 how the mind works, you conjecture again, am I right to interpret things? You can correct me

03:49.520 --> 03:54.400
 if I'm wrong, but you conjecture that human thought in the brain may be a result of a

03:54.400 --> 04:00.560
 massive network of highly interconnected neurons. So from this interconnectivity emerges thought

04:01.280 --> 04:05.600
 compared to artificial neural networks, which we use for machine learning today,

04:06.160 --> 04:12.640
 is there something fundamentally more complex, mysterious, even magical about the biological

04:12.640 --> 04:19.440
 neural networks versus the ones we've been starting to use over the past 60 years and

04:19.440 --> 04:24.720
 have become to success in the past 10? There is something a little bit mysterious

04:24.720 --> 04:31.600
 about the human neural networks, which is that each one of us who is a neural network knows that

04:31.600 --> 04:36.960
 we ourselves are conscious. Conscious not in the sense of registering our surroundings or even

04:36.960 --> 04:42.720
 registering our internal state, but in having subjective first person, present tense experience.

04:42.720 --> 04:49.840
 That is when I see red, it's not just different from green, but there's a redness to it that I

04:49.840 --> 04:54.960
 feel. Whether an artificial system would experience that or not, I don't know and I don't think I can

04:54.960 --> 05:00.480
 know. That's why it's mysterious. If we had a perfectly lifelike robot that was behaviorally

05:00.480 --> 05:06.800
 indistinguishable from a human, would we attribute consciousness to it or ought we to attribute

05:06.800 --> 05:12.160
 consciousness to it? And that's something that it's very hard to know. But putting that aside,

05:12.160 --> 05:19.040
 putting aside that largely philosophical question, the question is, is there some difference between

05:19.040 --> 05:23.760
 the human neural network and the ones that we're building in artificial intelligence will mean

05:23.760 --> 05:30.000
 that we're on the current trajectory, not going to reach the point where we've got a lifelike

05:30.000 --> 05:35.120
 robot indistinguishable from a human because the way their so called neural networks are organized

05:35.120 --> 05:39.760
 are different from the way ours are organized. I think there's overlap, but I think there are

05:39.760 --> 05:48.800
 some big differences that current neural networks, current so called deep learning systems are in

05:48.800 --> 05:53.840
 reality not all that deep. That is, they are very good at extracting high order statistical

05:53.840 --> 06:00.640
 regularities, but most of the systems don't have a semantic level, a level of actual understanding

06:00.640 --> 06:07.520
 of who did what to whom, why, where, how things work, what causes what else. Do you think that

06:07.520 --> 06:11.840
 kind of thing can emerge as it does? So artificial neural networks are much smaller, the number of

06:11.840 --> 06:17.760
 connections and so on than the current human biological networks, but do you think sort of

06:18.320 --> 06:22.800
 to go to consciousness or to go to this higher level semantic reasoning about things, do you

06:22.800 --> 06:29.760
 think that can emerge with just a larger network with a more richly weirdly interconnected network?

06:29.760 --> 06:33.280
 Separate it in consciousness because consciousness is even a matter of complexity.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.320
 A really weird one.

06:34.320 --> 06:38.400
 Yeah, you could sensibly ask the question of whether shrimp are conscious, for example,

06:38.400 --> 06:43.840
 they're not terribly complex, but maybe they feel pain. So let's just put that part of it aside.

06:44.400 --> 06:52.480
 But I think sheer size of a neural network is not enough to give it structure and knowledge,

06:52.480 --> 06:59.520
 but if it's suitably engineered, then why not? That is, we're neural networks, natural selection

06:59.520 --> 07:04.880
 did a kind of equivalent of engineering of our brains. So I don't think there's anything mysterious

07:04.880 --> 07:11.760
 in the sense that no system made out of silicon could ever do what a human brain can do. I think

07:11.760 --> 07:17.360
 it's possible in principle. Whether it'll ever happen depends not only on how clever we are

07:17.360 --> 07:22.240
 in engineering these systems, but whether we even want to, whether that's even a sensible goal.

07:22.240 --> 07:29.920
 That is, you can ask the question, is there any locomotion system that is as good as a human?

07:29.920 --> 07:33.920
 Well, we kind of want to do better than a human ultimately in terms of legged locomotion.

07:35.520 --> 07:39.760
 There's no reason that humans should be our benchmark. They're tools that might be better

07:39.760 --> 07:49.760
 in some ways. It may be that we can't duplicate a natural system because at some point it's so much

07:49.760 --> 07:54.560
 cheaper to use a natural system that we're not going to invest more brainpower and resources.

07:54.560 --> 08:00.480
 So for example, we don't really have an exact substitute for wood. We still build houses out

08:00.480 --> 08:05.040
 of wood. We still build furniture out of wood. We like the look. We like the feel. It has certain

08:05.040 --> 08:10.400
 properties that synthetics don't. It's not that there's anything magical or mysterious about wood.

08:11.120 --> 08:17.600
 It's just that the extra steps of duplicating everything about wood is something we just haven't

08:17.600 --> 08:21.600
 bothered because we have wood. Likewise, say cotton. I'm wearing cotton clothing now. It feels

08:21.600 --> 08:29.760
 much better than polyester. It's not that cotton has something magic in it. It's not that we couldn't

08:29.760 --> 08:35.920
 ever synthesize something exactly like cotton, but at some point it's just not worth it. We've got

08:35.920 --> 08:42.000
 cotton. Likewise, in the case of human intelligence, the goal of making an artificial system that is

08:42.000 --> 08:47.840
 exactly like the human brain is a goal that we probably know is going to pursue to the bitter

08:47.840 --> 08:53.120
 end, I suspect, because if you want tools that do things better than humans, you're not going to

08:53.120 --> 08:58.240
 care whether it does something like humans. So for example, diagnosing cancer or predicting the

08:58.240 --> 09:05.280
 weather, why set humans as your benchmark? But in general, I suspect you also believe

09:05.840 --> 09:10.480
 that even if the human should not be a benchmark and we don't want to imitate humans in their

09:10.480 --> 09:15.520
 system, there's a lot to be learned about how to create an artificial intelligence system by

09:15.520 --> 09:22.480
 studying the human. Yeah, I think that's right. In the same way that to build flying machines,

09:22.480 --> 09:27.760
 we want to understand the laws of aerodynamics, including birds, but not mimic the birds,

09:27.760 --> 09:35.440
 but they're the same laws. You have a view on AI, artificial intelligence, and safety

09:35.440 --> 09:47.040
 that, from my perspective, is refreshingly rational or perhaps more importantly, has elements

09:47.040 --> 09:53.040
 of positivity to it, which I think can be inspiring and empowering as opposed to paralyzing.

09:53.600 --> 09:59.840
 For many people, including AI researchers, the eventual existential threat of AI is obvious,

09:59.840 --> 10:05.840
 not only possible, but obvious. And for many others, including AI researchers, the threat

10:05.840 --> 10:14.640
 is not obvious. So Elon Musk is famously in the highly concerned about AI camp, saying things like

10:14.640 --> 10:21.200
 AI is far more dangerous than nuclear weapons, and that AI will likely destroy human civilization.

10:21.200 --> 10:29.360
 Human civilization. So in February, he said that if Elon was really serious about AI, the threat

10:29.360 --> 10:34.960
 of AI, he would stop building self driving cars that he's doing very successfully as part of Tesla.

10:35.760 --> 10:40.800
 Then he said, wow, if even Pinker doesn't understand the difference between narrow AI,

10:40.800 --> 10:47.280
 like a car and general AI, when the latter literally has a million times more compute power

10:47.280 --> 10:54.160
 and an open ended utility function, humanity is in deep trouble. So first, what did you mean by

10:54.160 --> 10:59.200
 the statement about Elon Musk should stop building self driving cars if he's deeply concerned?

11:00.080 --> 11:03.520
 Not the last time that Elon Musk has fired off an intemperate tweet.

11:04.320 --> 11:07.680
 Well, we live in a world where Twitter has power.

11:07.680 --> 11:16.640
 Yes. Yeah, I think there are two kinds of existential threat that have been discussed

11:16.640 --> 11:19.760
 in connection with artificial intelligence, and I think that they're both incoherent.

11:20.480 --> 11:29.520
 One of them is a vague fear of AI takeover, that just as we subjugated animals and less technologically

11:29.520 --> 11:34.640
 advanced peoples, so if we build something that's more advanced than us, it will inevitably turn us

11:34.640 --> 11:42.320
 into pets or slaves or domesticated animal equivalents. I think this confuses intelligence

11:42.320 --> 11:49.200
 with a will to power, that it so happens that in the intelligence system we are most familiar with,

11:49.200 --> 11:54.160
 namely homo sapiens, we are products of natural selection, which is a competitive process,

11:54.160 --> 11:59.600
 and so bundled together with our problem solving capacity are a number of nasty traits like

12:00.320 --> 12:08.720
 dominance and exploitation and maximization of power and glory and resources and influence.

12:08.720 --> 12:13.120
 There's no reason to think that sheer problem solving capability will set that as one of its

12:13.120 --> 12:18.720
 goals. Its goals will be whatever we set its goals as, and as long as someone isn't building a

12:18.720 --> 12:24.320
 megalomaniacal artificial intelligence, then there's no reason to think that it would naturally

12:24.320 --> 12:28.960
 evolve in that direction. Now, you might say, well, what if we gave it the goal of maximizing

12:28.960 --> 12:34.880
 its own power source? That's a pretty stupid goal to give an autonomous system. You don't give it

12:34.880 --> 12:40.720
 that goal. I mean, that's just self evidently idiotic. So if you look at the history of the

12:40.720 --> 12:45.120
 world, there's been a lot of opportunities where engineers could instill in a system

12:45.120 --> 12:49.440
 destructive power and they choose not to because that's the natural process of engineering.

12:49.440 --> 12:53.120
 Well, except for weapons. I mean, if you're building a weapon, its goal is to destroy people,

12:53.680 --> 12:58.560
 and so I think there are good reasons to not build certain kinds of weapons. I think building

12:58.560 --> 13:06.480
 nuclear weapons was a massive mistake. You do. So maybe pause on that because that is one of

13:06.480 --> 13:12.800
 the serious threats. Do you think that it was a mistake in a sense that it should have been

13:12.800 --> 13:19.200
 stopped early on? Or do you think it's just an unfortunate event of invention that this was

13:19.200 --> 13:23.280
 invented? Do you think it's possible to stop? I guess is the question. It's hard to rewind the

13:23.280 --> 13:28.320
 clock because of course it was invented in the context of World War II and the fear that the

13:28.320 --> 13:35.120
 Nazis might develop one first. Then once it was initiated for that reason, it was hard to turn

13:35.120 --> 13:42.080
 off, especially since winning the war against the Japanese and the Nazis was such an overwhelming

13:42.080 --> 13:47.120
 goal of every responsible person that there's just nothing that people wouldn't have done then

13:47.120 --> 13:52.560
 to ensure victory. It's quite possible if World War II hadn't happened that nuclear weapons

13:52.560 --> 13:57.440
 wouldn't have been invented. We can't know, but I don't think it was by any means a necessity,

13:57.440 --> 14:02.720
 any more than some of the other weapon systems that were envisioned but never implemented,

14:02.720 --> 14:09.360
 like planes that would disperse poison gas over cities like crop dusters or systems to try to

14:10.560 --> 14:16.000
 create earthquakes and tsunamis in enemy countries, to weaponize the weather,

14:16.000 --> 14:21.120
 weaponize solar flares, all kinds of crazy schemes that we thought the better of.

14:21.120 --> 14:25.840
 I think analogies between nuclear weapons and artificial intelligence are fundamentally

14:25.840 --> 14:30.560
 misguided because the whole point of nuclear weapons is to destroy things. The point of

14:30.560 --> 14:36.080
 artificial intelligence is not to destroy things. So the analogy is misleading.

14:36.080 --> 14:39.920
 So there's two artificial intelligence you mentioned. The first one I guess is highly

14:39.920 --> 14:42.080
 intelligent or power hungry.

14:42.080 --> 14:46.800
 Yeah, it's a system that we design ourselves where we give it the goals. Goals are external to

14:46.800 --> 14:55.200
 the means to attain the goals. If we don't design an artificially intelligent system to

14:55.200 --> 15:00.800
 maximize dominance, then it won't maximize dominance. It's just that we're so familiar

15:00.800 --> 15:06.320
 with homo sapiens where these two traits come bundled together, particularly in men,

15:06.320 --> 15:14.480
 that we are apt to confuse high intelligence with a will to power, but that's just an error.

15:15.520 --> 15:21.440
 The other fear is that will be collateral damage that will give artificial intelligence a goal

15:21.440 --> 15:27.440
 like make paper clips and it will pursue that goal so brilliantly that before we can stop it,

15:27.440 --> 15:32.800
 it turns us into paper clips. We'll give it the goal of curing cancer and it will turn us into

15:32.800 --> 15:38.720
 guinea pigs for lethal experiments or give it the goal of world peace and its conception of world

15:38.720 --> 15:43.680
 peace is no people, therefore no fighting and so it will kill us all. Now I think these are utterly

15:43.680 --> 15:49.040
 fanciful. In fact, I think they're actually self defeating. They first of all assume that we're

15:49.040 --> 15:53.600
 going to be so brilliant that we can design an artificial intelligence that can cure cancer,

15:53.600 --> 15:59.600
 but so stupid that we don't specify what we mean by curing cancer in enough detail that it won't

15:59.600 --> 16:06.240
 kill us in the process and it assumes that the system will be so smart that it can cure cancer,

16:06.240 --> 16:11.920
 but so idiotic that it can't figure out that what we mean by curing cancer is not killing everyone.

16:12.880 --> 16:18.320
 I think that the collateral damage scenario, the value alignment problem is also based on

16:18.320 --> 16:23.200
 a misconception. So one of the challenges, of course, we don't know how to build either system

16:23.200 --> 16:27.440
 currently or are we even close to knowing? Of course, those things can change overnight,

16:27.440 --> 16:33.840
 but at this time, theorizing about it is very challenging in either direction. So that's

16:33.840 --> 16:39.600
 probably at the core of the problem is without that ability to reason about the real engineering

16:39.600 --> 16:45.120
 things here at hand is your imagination runs away with things. Exactly. But let me sort of ask,

16:45.120 --> 16:52.320
 what do you think was the motivation, the thought process of Elon Musk? I build autonomous vehicles,

16:52.320 --> 16:57.680
 I study autonomous vehicles, I study Tesla autopilot. I think it is one of the greatest

16:57.680 --> 17:04.400
 currently large scale application of artificial intelligence in the world. It has potentially a

17:04.400 --> 17:10.880
 very positive impact on society. So how does a person who's creating this very good quote unquote

17:10.880 --> 17:19.280
 narrow AI system also seem to be so concerned about this other general AI? What do you think

17:19.280 --> 17:23.040
 is the motivation there? What do you think is the thing? Well, you probably have to ask him,

17:23.040 --> 17:31.520
 but there, and he is notoriously flamboyant, impulsive to the, as we have just seen,

17:31.520 --> 17:37.360
 to the detriment of his own goals of the health of the company. So I don't know what's going on

17:37.360 --> 17:42.560
 in his mind. You probably have to ask him, but I don't think the, and I don't think the distinction

17:42.560 --> 17:50.240
 between special purpose AI and so called general AI is relevant that in the same way that special

17:50.240 --> 17:56.400
 purpose AI is not going to do anything conceivable in order to attain a goal. All engineering systems

17:57.760 --> 18:02.800
 are designed to trade off across multiple goals. When we build cars in the first place,

18:02.800 --> 18:08.880
 we didn't forget to install brakes because the goal of a car is to go fast. It occurred to people,

18:08.880 --> 18:13.920
 yes, you want it to go fast, but not always. So you would build in brakes too. Likewise,

18:13.920 --> 18:20.320
 if a car is going to be autonomous and program it to take the shortest route to the airport,

18:20.320 --> 18:24.560
 it's not going to take the diagonal and mow down people and trees and fences because that's the

18:24.560 --> 18:29.120
 shortest route. That's not what we mean by the shortest route when we program it. And that's just

18:29.120 --> 18:36.000
 what an intelligence system is by definition. It takes into account multiple constraints.

18:36.000 --> 18:41.280
 The same is true, in fact, even more true of so called general intelligence. That is,

18:41.280 --> 18:48.080
 if it's genuinely intelligent, it's not going to pursue some goal singlemindedly, omitting every

18:48.080 --> 18:54.400
 other consideration and collateral effect. That's not artificial and general intelligence. That's

18:54.400 --> 19:01.120
 artificial stupidity. I agree with you, by the way, on the promise of autonomous vehicles for

19:01.120 --> 19:06.160
 improving human welfare. I think it's spectacular. And I'm surprised at how little press coverage

19:06.160 --> 19:11.040
 notes that in the United States alone, something like 40,000 people die every year on the highways,

19:11.680 --> 19:17.680
 vastly more than are killed by terrorists. And we spent a trillion dollars on a war to combat

19:18.240 --> 19:24.160
 deaths by terrorism, about half a dozen a year. Whereas year in, year out, 40,000 people are

19:24.160 --> 19:29.920
 massacred on the highways, which could be brought down to very close to zero. So I'm with you on

19:29.920 --> 19:34.800
 the humanitarian benefit. Let me just mention that as a person who's building these cars,

19:34.800 --> 19:39.360
 it is a little bit offensive to me to say that engineers would be clueless enough not to engineer

19:39.360 --> 19:45.280
 safety into systems. I often stay up at night thinking about those 40,000 people that are dying.

19:45.280 --> 19:50.800
 And everything I tried to engineer is to save those people's lives. So every new invention that

19:50.800 --> 19:59.280
 I'm super excited about, in all the deep learning literature and CVPR conferences and NIPS, everything

19:59.280 --> 20:08.240
 I'm super excited about is all grounded in making it safe and help people. So I just don't see how

20:08.240 --> 20:13.280
 that trajectory can all of a sudden slip into a situation where intelligence will be highly

20:13.280 --> 20:17.920
 negative. You and I certainly agree on that. And I think that's only the beginning of the

20:17.920 --> 20:24.320
 potential humanitarian benefits of artificial intelligence. There's been enormous attention to

20:24.320 --> 20:28.720
 what are we going to do with the people whose jobs are made obsolete by artificial intelligence,

20:28.720 --> 20:32.560
 but very little attention given to the fact that the jobs that are going to be made obsolete are

20:32.560 --> 20:38.960
 horrible jobs. The fact that people aren't going to be picking crops and making beds and driving

20:38.960 --> 20:45.520
 trucks and mining coal, these are soul deadening jobs. And we have a whole literature sympathizing

20:45.520 --> 20:53.040
 with the people stuck in these menial, mind deadening, dangerous jobs. If we can eliminate

20:53.040 --> 20:58.480
 them, this is a fantastic boon to humanity. Now granted, you solve one problem and there's another

20:58.480 --> 21:05.840
 one, namely, how do we get these people a decent income? But if we're smart enough to invent machines

21:05.840 --> 21:12.400
 that can make beds and put away dishes and handle hospital patients, I think we're smart enough to

21:12.400 --> 21:19.200
 figure out how to redistribute income to apportion some of the vast economic savings to the human

21:19.200 --> 21:26.000
 beings who will no longer be needed to make beds. Okay. Sam Harris says that it's obvious that

21:26.000 --> 21:30.960
 eventually AI will be an existential risk. He's one of the people who says it's obvious.

21:31.760 --> 21:38.640
 We don't know when the claim goes, but eventually it's obvious. And because we don't know when,

21:38.640 --> 21:45.680
 we should worry about it now. This is a very interesting argument in my eyes. So how do we

21:45.680 --> 21:51.120
 think about timescale? How do we think about existential threats when we don't really, we know

21:51.120 --> 21:58.160
 so little about the threat, unlike nuclear weapons perhaps, about this particular threat, that it

21:58.160 --> 22:04.560
 could happen tomorrow, right? So, but very likely it won't. Very likely it'd be a hundred years away.

22:04.560 --> 22:11.440
 So how do we ignore it? How do we talk about it? Do we worry about it? How do we think about those?

22:12.480 --> 22:13.040
 What is it?

22:13.840 --> 22:18.560
 A threat that we can imagine. It's within the limits of our imagination,

22:18.560 --> 22:23.360
 but not within our limits of understanding to accurately predict it.

22:24.320 --> 22:26.880
 But what is the it that we're afraid of?

22:26.880 --> 22:30.320
 Sorry. AI being the existential threat.

22:30.320 --> 22:35.120
 AI. How? Like enslaving us or turning us into paperclips?

22:35.120 --> 22:38.720
 I think the most compelling from the Sam Harris perspective would be the paperclip situation.

22:39.520 --> 22:43.440
 Yeah. I mean, I just think it's totally fanciful. I mean, that is don't build a system.

22:43.440 --> 22:50.080
 Don't give a, don't, first of all, the code of engineering is you don't implement a system with

22:50.080 --> 22:55.040
 massive control before testing it. Now, perhaps the culture of engineering will radically change.

22:55.040 --> 23:00.320
 Then I would worry, but I don't see any signs that engineers will suddenly do idiotic things,

23:00.320 --> 23:06.400
 like put a electric power plant in control of a system that they haven't tested first.

23:07.360 --> 23:14.720
 Or all of these scenarios, not only imagine almost a magically powered intelligence,

23:15.600 --> 23:20.240
 including things like cure cancer, which is probably an incoherent goal because there's

23:20.240 --> 23:25.600
 so many different kinds of cancer or bring about world peace. I mean, how do you even specify that

23:25.600 --> 23:31.360
 as a goal? But the scenarios also imagine some degree of control of every molecule in the

23:31.360 --> 23:38.400
 universe, which not only is itself unlikely, but we would not start to connect these systems to

23:39.120 --> 23:45.680
 infrastructure without testing as we would any kind of engineering system.

23:45.680 --> 23:53.920
 Now, maybe some engineers will be irresponsible and we need legal and regulatory and legal

23:53.920 --> 23:59.440
 responsibility implemented so that engineers don't do things that are stupid by their own standards.

24:00.640 --> 24:08.560
 But the, I've never seen enough of a plausible scenario of existential threat to devote large

24:08.560 --> 24:14.240
 amounts of brain power to, to forestall it. So you believe in the sort of the power on

24:14.240 --> 24:19.520
 mass of the engineering of reason, as you argue in your latest book of Reason and Science, to sort of

24:20.400 --> 24:26.400
 be the very thing that guides the development of new technology so it's safe and also keeps us safe.

24:28.000 --> 24:34.560
 You know, granted the same culture of safety that currently is part of the engineering mindset for

24:34.560 --> 24:40.480
 airplanes, for example. So yeah, I don't think that that should be thrown out the window and

24:40.480 --> 24:45.520
 that untested all powerful systems should be suddenly implemented, but there's no reason to

24:45.520 --> 24:50.400
 think they are. And in fact, if you look at the progress of artificial intelligence, it's been,

24:50.400 --> 24:54.160
 you know, it's been impressive, especially in the last 10 years or so, but the idea that suddenly

24:54.160 --> 25:00.080
 there'll be a step function that all of a sudden before we know it, it will be all powerful,

25:00.080 --> 25:06.800
 that there'll be some kind of recursive self improvement, some kind of fume is also fanciful.

25:06.800 --> 25:13.200
 We, certainly by the technology that we, that we're now impresses us, such as deep learning,

25:13.200 --> 25:18.320
 where you train something on hundreds of thousands or millions of examples,

25:18.320 --> 25:25.200
 they're not hundreds of thousands of problems of which curing cancer is a typical example.

25:26.000 --> 25:31.520
 And so the kind of techniques that have allowed AI to increase in the last five years are not the

25:31.520 --> 25:40.320
 kind that are going to lead to this fantasy of exponential sudden self improvement. I think it's

25:40.320 --> 25:45.440
 kind of a magical thinking. It's not based on our understanding of how AI actually works.

25:45.440 --> 25:51.040
 Now give me a chance here. So you said fanciful, magical thinking. In his TED talk,

25:51.040 --> 25:55.760
 Sam Harris says that thinking about AI killing all human civilization is somehow fun,

25:55.760 --> 26:00.400
 intellectually. Now I have to say as a scientist engineer, I don't find it fun,

26:00.400 --> 26:08.560
 but when I'm having beer with my non AI friends, there is indeed something fun and appealing about

26:08.560 --> 26:14.640
 it. Like talking about an episode of Black Mirror, considering if a large meteor is headed towards

26:14.640 --> 26:20.640
 Earth, we were just told a large meteor is headed towards Earth, something like this. And can you

26:20.640 --> 26:24.560
 relate to this sense of fun? And do you understand the psychology of it?

26:24.560 --> 26:32.800
 Yes. Good question. I personally don't find it fun. I find it kind of actually a waste of time

26:32.800 --> 26:39.760
 because there are genuine threats that we ought to be thinking about like pandemics, like cyber

26:39.760 --> 26:46.160
 security vulnerabilities, like the possibility of nuclear war and certainly climate change.

26:46.160 --> 26:54.320
 You know, this is enough to fill many conversations. And I think Sam did put his

26:54.320 --> 27:00.240
 finger on something, namely that there is a community, sometimes called the rationality

27:00.240 --> 27:07.280
 community, that delights in using its brainpower to come up with scenarios that would not occur

27:07.280 --> 27:14.560
 to mere mortals, to less cerebral people. So there is a kind of intellectual thrill in finding new

27:14.560 --> 27:19.280
 things to worry about that no one has worried about yet. I actually think, though, that it's

27:19.840 --> 27:25.440
 not only is it a kind of fun that doesn't give me particular pleasure, but I think there can be a

27:25.440 --> 27:32.400
 pernicious side to it, namely that you overcome people with such dread, such fatalism, that there

27:32.400 --> 27:39.200
 are so many ways to die, to annihilate our civilization, that we may as well enjoy life

27:39.200 --> 27:42.880
 while we can. There's nothing we can do about it. If climate change doesn't do us in, then runaway

27:42.880 --> 27:52.480
 robots will. So let's enjoy ourselves now. We've got to prioritize. We have to look at threats that

27:52.480 --> 27:58.160
 are close to certainty, such as climate change, and distinguish those from ones that are merely

27:58.160 --> 28:05.280
 imaginable but with infinitesimal probabilities. And we have to take into account people's worry

28:05.280 --> 28:12.480
 budget. You can't worry about everything. And if you sow dread and fear and terror and fatalism,

28:12.480 --> 28:17.280
 it can lead to a kind of numbness. Well, these problems are overwhelming, and the engineers are

28:17.280 --> 28:25.760
 just going to kill us all. So let's either destroy the entire infrastructure of science, technology,

28:26.640 --> 28:32.560
 or let's just enjoy life while we can. So there's a certain line of worry, which I'm worried about

28:32.560 --> 28:36.800
 a lot of things in engineering. There's a certain line of worry when you cross, you're allowed to

28:36.800 --> 28:43.360
 cross, that it becomes paralyzing fear as opposed to productive fear. And that's kind of what

28:44.240 --> 28:50.160
 you're highlighting. Exactly right. And we've seen some, we know that human effort is not

28:50.160 --> 28:58.160
 well calibrated against risk in that because a basic tenet of cognitive psychology is that

28:58.160 --> 29:05.680
 perception of risk and hence perception of fear is driven by imaginability, not by data. And so we

29:05.680 --> 29:11.360
 misallocate vast amounts of resources to avoiding terrorism, which kills on average about six

29:11.360 --> 29:18.640
 Americans a year with one exception of 9 11. We invade countries, we invent entire new departments

29:18.640 --> 29:25.120
 of government with massive, massive expenditure of resources and lives to defend ourselves against

29:25.120 --> 29:34.720
 a trivial risk. Whereas guaranteed risks, one of them you mentioned traffic fatalities and even

29:34.720 --> 29:45.200
 risks that are not here, but are plausible enough to worry about like pandemics, like nuclear war,

29:45.920 --> 29:51.440
 receive far too little attention. In presidential debates, there's no discussion of how to minimize

29:51.440 --> 29:58.240
 the risk of nuclear war. Lots of discussion of terrorism, for example. And so I think it's

29:58.240 --> 30:08.080
 essential to calibrate our budget of fear, worry, concern, planning to the actual probability of

30:08.080 --> 30:15.840
 harm. Yep. So let me ask this question. So speaking of imaginability, you said it's important to think

30:15.840 --> 30:23.360
 about reason and one of my favorite people who likes to dip into the outskirts of reason through

30:23.840 --> 30:32.000
 fascinating exploration of his imagination is Joe Rogan. Oh yes. So who has through reason used to

30:32.000 --> 30:37.280
 believe a lot of conspiracies and through reason has stripped away a lot of his beliefs in that

30:37.280 --> 30:43.120
 way. So it's fascinating actually to watch him through rationality kind of throw away the ideas

30:43.120 --> 30:50.320
 of Bigfoot and 9 11. I'm not sure exactly. Kim Trails. I don't know what he believes in. Yes.

30:50.320 --> 30:55.520
 Okay. But he no longer believed in. No, that's right. No, he's become a real force for good.

30:55.520 --> 31:00.240
 Yep. So you were on the Joe Rogan podcast in February and had a fascinating conversation,

31:00.240 --> 31:05.920
 but as far as I remember, didn't talk much about artificial intelligence. I will be on his podcast

31:05.920 --> 31:11.520
 in a couple of weeks. Joe is very much concerned about existential threat of AI. I'm not sure if

31:11.520 --> 31:17.040
 you're, this is why I was hoping that you would get into that topic. And in this way,

31:17.040 --> 31:21.840
 he represents quite a lot of people who look at the topic of AI from 10,000 foot level.

31:22.480 --> 31:29.040
 So as an exercise of communication, you said it's important to be rational and reason

31:29.040 --> 31:34.080
 about these things. Let me ask, if you were to coach me as an AI researcher about how to speak

31:34.080 --> 31:40.640
 to Joe and the general public about AI, what would you advise? Well, the short answer would be to

31:40.640 --> 31:45.200
 read the sections that I wrote in enlightenment now about AI, but a longer reason would be I

31:45.200 --> 31:50.480
 think to emphasize, and I think you're very well positioned as an engineer to remind people about

31:50.480 --> 31:57.040
 the culture of engineering, that it really is safety oriented, that another discussion in

31:57.040 --> 32:04.560
 enlightenment now, I plot rates of accidental death from various causes, plane crashes, car

32:04.560 --> 32:12.640
 crashes, occupational accidents, even death by lightning strikes. And they all plummet because

32:12.640 --> 32:18.320
 the culture of engineering is how do you squeeze out the lethal risks, death by fire, death by

32:18.320 --> 32:24.320
 drowning, death by asphyxiation, all of them drastically declined because of advances in

32:24.320 --> 32:29.840
 engineering that I got to say, I did not appreciate until I saw those graphs. And it is because

32:29.840 --> 32:37.520
 exactly, people like you who stay up at night thinking, oh my God, is what I'm inventing likely

32:37.520 --> 32:43.760
 to hurt people and to deploy ingenuity to prevent that from happening. Now, I'm not an engineer,

32:43.760 --> 32:48.240
 although I spent 22 years at MIT, so I know something about the culture of engineering.

32:48.240 --> 32:53.680
 My understanding is that this is the way you think if you're an engineer. And it's essential

32:53.680 --> 32:59.200
 that that culture not be suddenly switched off when it comes to artificial intelligence. So,

32:59.200 --> 33:02.560
 I mean, that could be a problem, but is there any reason to think it would be switched off?

33:02.560 --> 33:06.960
 I don't think so. And one, there's not enough engineers speaking up for this

33:06.960 --> 33:13.440
 way, for the excitement, for the positive view of human nature, what you're trying to create

33:13.440 --> 33:18.240
 is positivity. Like everything we try to invent is trying to do good for the world.

33:18.240 --> 33:23.600
 But let me ask you about the psychology of negativity. It seems just objectively,

33:23.600 --> 33:28.480
 not considering the topic, it seems that being negative about the future makes you sound smarter

33:28.480 --> 33:33.520
 than being positive about the future, irregardless of topic. Am I correct in this observation? And

33:34.320 --> 33:39.280
 if so, why do you think that is? Yeah, I think there is that phenomenon that,

33:40.080 --> 33:44.240
 as Tom Lehrer, the satirist said, always predict the worst and you'll be hailed as a prophet.

33:45.360 --> 33:52.240
 It may be part of our overall negativity bias. We are as a species more attuned to the negative

33:52.240 --> 33:59.920
 than the positive. We dread losses more than we enjoy gains. And that might open up a space for

34:02.480 --> 34:06.560
 prophets to remind us of harms and risks and losses that we may have overlooked.

34:07.680 --> 34:15.040
 So I think there is that asymmetry. So you've written some of my favorite books

34:16.080 --> 34:21.600
 all over the place. So starting from Enlightenment Now to The Better Ages of Our Nature,

34:21.600 --> 34:28.560
 Blank Slate, How the Mind Works, the one about language, Language Instinct. Bill Gates,

34:29.200 --> 34:35.680
 big fan too, said of your most recent book that it's my new favorite book of all time.

34:37.440 --> 34:43.840
 So for you as an author, what was a book early on in your life that had a profound impact on the

34:43.840 --> 34:49.040
 way you saw the world? Certainly this book, Enlightenment Now, was influenced by David

34:49.040 --> 34:55.920
 Deutsch's The Beginning of Infinity, a rather deep reflection on knowledge and the power of

34:55.920 --> 35:02.320
 knowledge to improve the human condition. And with bits of wisdom such as that problems are

35:02.320 --> 35:07.440
 inevitable but problems are solvable given the right knowledge and that solutions create new

35:07.440 --> 35:11.920
 problems that have to be solved in their turn. That's I think a kind of wisdom about the human

35:11.920 --> 35:16.080
 condition that influenced the writing of this book. There are some books that are excellent

35:16.080 --> 35:22.080
 but obscure, some of which I have on a page on my website. I read a book called The History of Force,

35:22.800 --> 35:27.840
 self published by a political scientist named James Payne on the historical decline of violence

35:27.840 --> 35:30.800
 and that was one of the inspirations for The Better Angels of Our Nature.

35:33.600 --> 35:37.520
 What about early on? If you look back when you were maybe a teenager?

35:38.160 --> 35:43.040
 I loved a book called One, Two, Three, Infinity. When I was a young adult I read that book by

35:43.040 --> 35:48.960
 George Gamow, the physicist, which had very accessible and humorous explanations of

35:48.960 --> 35:59.360
 relativity, of number theory, of dimensionality, high multiple dimensional spaces in a way that I

35:59.360 --> 36:06.080
 think is still delightful 70 years after it was published. I like the Time Life Science series.

36:06.080 --> 36:11.280
 These are books that would arrive every month that my mother subscribed to, each one on a different

36:11.280 --> 36:17.280
 topic. One would be on electricity, one would be on forests, one would be on evolution and then one

36:17.280 --> 36:24.240
 was on the mind. I was just intrigued that there could be a science of mind and that book I would

36:24.240 --> 36:28.480
 cite as an influence as well. Then later on... That's when you fell in love with the idea of

36:28.480 --> 36:35.040
 studying the mind? Was that the thing that grabbed you? It was one of the things I would say. I read

36:35.040 --> 36:41.360
 as a college student the book Reflections on Language by Noam Chomsky. I spent most of his

36:41.360 --> 36:47.440
 career here at MIT. Richard Dawkins, two books, The Blind Watchmaker and The Selfish Gene,

36:47.440 --> 36:54.240
 were enormously influential, mainly for the content but also for the writing style, the

 ability to explain abstract concepts in lively prose. Stephen Jay Gould's first collection,

37:02.480 --> 37:10.240
 Ever Since Darwin, also an excellent example of lively writing. George Miller, a psychologist that

37:10.240 --> 37:15.600
 most psychologists are familiar with, came up with the idea that human memory has a capacity of

37:16.160 --> 37:20.640
 seven plus or minus two chunks. That's probably his biggest claim to fame. But he wrote a couple

37:20.640 --> 37:25.840
 of books on language and communication that I read as an undergraduate. Again, beautifully written

37:25.840 --> 37:31.920
 and intellectually deep. Wonderful. Stephen, thank you so much for taking the time today.

37:31.920 --> 37:33.920
 My pleasure. Thanks a lot, Lex.
