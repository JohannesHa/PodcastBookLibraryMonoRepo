00:00.000 --> 00:03.420
 Talking about an exciting thing for an engineer,

00:03.420 --> 00:05.760
 the same Snapdragon that goes to a phone

00:05.760 --> 00:08.380
 and it can go to a Galaxy phone, for example, Samsung,

00:08.380 --> 00:12.600
 the same, not a special one, went all the way to Mars.

00:12.600 --> 00:17.000
 You expect to have a full day of battery life,

00:17.000 --> 00:20.320
 but then you want it to not be sending data

00:20.320 --> 00:23.240
 into 10 or 100 megabits.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.800
 You want gigabits.

00:24.800 --> 00:28.080
 You want it to be able to have eight core processors.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.720
 You want to have a GPU with ray tracing.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.600
 You want to have all of those things

00:32.600 --> 00:37.600
 that you can only get into sometimes a desktop PC.

00:37.880 --> 00:41.160
 To do all of that in your phone is an incredible thing.

00:41.160 --> 00:44.060
 Some people raise concerns about there not being enough

00:44.060 --> 00:47.560
 studies about the effects of 5G on the human body.

00:47.560 --> 00:48.960
 Is 5G safe?

00:51.920 --> 00:55.040
 The following is a conversation with Cristiano Aman,

00:55.040 --> 00:57.200
 the CEO of Qualcomm.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.780
 The company that's one of the leaders in the world

00:59.780 --> 01:03.120
 in the space of mobile communication and computation.

01:03.120 --> 01:08.120
 That's 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G that connects billions of phones,

01:08.300 --> 01:12.280
 and the Snapdragon processor and system on a chip

01:12.280 --> 01:15.320
 that is the brain of most of the premium Android phones

01:15.320 --> 01:16.700
 in the world.

01:16.700 --> 01:18.720
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.600
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:20.600 --> 01:21.800
 in the description.

01:21.800 --> 01:25.780
 And now, dear friends, here's Cristiano Aman.

01:25.780 --> 01:28.540
 You are originally from Brazil,

01:28.540 --> 01:31.340
 so let me ask the most important question,

01:31.340 --> 01:33.260
 the most profound question, the biggest question.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.620
 Who's the greatest football soccer player of all time?

01:36.620 --> 01:38.540
 Look, everybody's gonna say Pele,

01:38.540 --> 01:42.500
 and actually I was born during the game

01:42.500 --> 01:47.500
 of Brazil and Italy that Pele gave Brazil the championship.

01:47.940 --> 01:52.060
 Actually it was, my dad tells me that the doctor

01:52.060 --> 01:54.980
 had a TV on at the delivery room.

01:54.980 --> 01:56.660
 But, so everybody will say Pele,

01:56.660 --> 01:58.600
 but I really like Ronaldo.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.780
 The first, not Ronaldinho, the first Ronaldo.

02:01.780 --> 02:02.900
 I really like him.

02:02.900 --> 02:04.460
 That's my favorite player.

02:04.460 --> 02:07.220
 By the way, not everybody would say Pele.

02:07.220 --> 02:09.700
 But we shall leave that on the table

02:09.700 --> 02:11.460
 and agree to disagree.

02:11.460 --> 02:12.700
 Brazilians will say Pele.

02:12.700 --> 02:13.540
 Yes.

02:14.420 --> 02:17.740
 There's other countries around that region

02:17.740 --> 02:19.140
 that may disagree a little bit.

02:19.140 --> 02:19.980
 I'm very aware.

02:19.980 --> 02:24.980
 Qualcomm is largely responsible for 5G

02:25.300 --> 02:28.060
 and some of the greatest processors

02:28.060 --> 02:29.780
 in our smartphones ever built.

02:29.780 --> 02:33.420
 So we got communication and computation tech

02:33.420 --> 02:36.800
 that impacts probably billions of people.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.420
 So if you zoom out, you as a human,

02:39.420 --> 02:41.420
 we'll look at humans on Earth in general,

02:42.940 --> 02:47.580
 does it blow your mind that we have these billions

02:47.580 --> 02:50.980
 of smartphones communicating and each of them

02:50.980 --> 02:53.260
 have the computational power?

02:53.260 --> 02:56.100
 You know, you talk about 10 billion transistors.

02:56.100 --> 02:59.780
 That's a million times more than 50 years ago

02:59.780 --> 03:01.380
 in the best computers in the world.

03:01.380 --> 03:04.400
 Like if you just zoom out as a human,

03:05.260 --> 03:06.300
 does that blow your mind?

03:06.300 --> 03:07.420
 Absolutely.

03:07.420 --> 03:10.340
 Look, one of the reasons I think I love this company

03:10.340 --> 03:13.660
 is we know that the technology we develop

03:13.660 --> 03:14.500
 can change the world.

03:14.500 --> 03:15.740
 And I'll tell you one more thing.

03:15.740 --> 03:18.260
 Beyond the amount of processing power

03:18.260 --> 03:20.260
 that you have now in the palm of your hands

03:20.260 --> 03:22.580
 and being every one of the world is connected

03:22.580 --> 03:24.460
 with broadband technology,

03:24.460 --> 03:28.020
 the smartphone is also mankind largest development platform.

03:28.020 --> 03:29.620
 There's nothing like it.

03:29.620 --> 03:31.980
 So you respect both the hardware and the software?

03:31.980 --> 03:33.020
 Both.

03:33.020 --> 03:33.840
 Both.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.900
 If aliens were observing Earth over the past 50 to 70 years,

03:36.900 --> 03:38.540
 how do you think they would describe

03:38.540 --> 03:43.540
 this particular turmoil, fun things going on

03:43.540 --> 03:47.900
 on the surface of this particular little planet?

03:47.900 --> 03:49.540
 We live in interesting times.

03:50.820 --> 03:55.460
 In one time, we see incredible development of technology

03:55.460 --> 03:59.340
 for mankind just what happened in the last century.

03:59.340 --> 04:04.340
 You know, from 1900 to 2000, it was incredible development.

04:04.420 --> 04:07.700
 Just look, 2000 was 22 years ago,

04:07.700 --> 04:10.580
 how far we're coming and where we're going with technology.

04:10.580 --> 04:11.900
 It's incredible.

04:11.900 --> 04:13.540
 What do you think they would notice?

04:13.540 --> 04:16.540
 So there's road networks, there's all kinds of networks.

04:16.540 --> 04:19.300
 There's lights that keep popping up,

04:19.300 --> 04:21.860
 cities springing up, like from an alien perspective,

04:21.860 --> 04:22.700
 you're observing.

04:22.700 --> 04:24.900
 Well, what I'm gonna tell you is you have this contrast

04:24.900 --> 04:27.620
 of incredible development of technology,

04:27.620 --> 04:28.940
 but then you see some of the things

04:28.940 --> 04:30.420
 that are happening right now,

04:30.420 --> 04:33.660
 which is probably you would not expect them to happen

04:33.660 --> 04:36.860
 on the 21st century, just what happened in Ukraine.

04:36.860 --> 04:40.300
 So I think that will be a more puzzling question

04:40.300 --> 04:42.500
 for the aliens, I would imagine.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.900
 The new technology is kind of impressive.

04:44.900 --> 04:46.460
 Actually, that might not be so puzzling

04:46.460 --> 04:49.020
 because that's just human nature revealing itself

04:49.020 --> 04:50.620
 as it has throughout human history.

04:50.620 --> 04:51.460
 That's correct.

04:52.780 --> 04:54.860
 Let's talk about wireless communication.

04:54.860 --> 04:58.540
 So Qualcomm was instrumental in developing 5G.

04:58.540 --> 05:01.100
 Now you were with Qualcomm since the early days,

05:01.100 --> 05:05.580
 the good old 90s with the 2G, but what is 5G,

05:05.580 --> 05:10.100
 including sub six gigahertz 5G and millimeter wave 5G?

05:10.100 --> 05:10.940
 How does it work?

05:10.940 --> 05:13.340
 And maybe the most important question is

05:13.340 --> 05:15.900
 how will it change the world in the coming years?

05:15.900 --> 05:18.300
 When we set ourselves to develop 5G,

05:18.300 --> 05:21.980
 and we look at this, every generation of technology

05:21.980 --> 05:24.180
 had a problem to be solved, right?

05:24.180 --> 05:26.580
 So you mentioned 2G, 2G challenge,

05:26.580 --> 05:29.340
 the challenge of CDMA was can we give every person

05:29.340 --> 05:30.900
 on earth a cell phone?

05:30.900 --> 05:33.060
 That was, can you get to a technology

05:33.060 --> 05:36.100
 that you can basically allow everyone

05:36.100 --> 05:37.660
 to have a mobile phone?

05:37.660 --> 05:41.100
 3G was about the ability to connect that to the internet.

05:41.100 --> 05:45.140
 I think 4G was broadband and with 4G was about

05:45.140 --> 05:46.780
 have the ability for you to have a computer

05:46.780 --> 05:48.020
 in the palm of your hand.

05:48.020 --> 05:49.540
 We'll just talk about that.

05:49.540 --> 05:52.180
 5G, the challenge was a little bit different.

05:52.180 --> 05:55.140
 It's how do we build a technology for a society

05:55.140 --> 05:57.980
 that is gonna be 100% connected to the cloud?

05:57.980 --> 06:00.900
 How do we provide a technology that is going to be

06:00.900 --> 06:04.260
 the last mile connectivity for everything?

06:04.260 --> 06:07.980
 So 5G has basically been designed,

06:07.980 --> 06:10.300
 eliminate all issues with data congestion,

06:10.300 --> 06:14.500
 whether you are in stadium, we talk about soccer,

06:14.500 --> 06:16.900
 you were in a stadium and everyone should be

06:16.900 --> 06:19.340
 ability to have access to broadband.

06:19.340 --> 06:20.900
 So deal with congestion.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.900
 Deal with the fact that not only people,

06:22.900 --> 06:25.980
 but billions of things need to be connected.

06:25.980 --> 06:29.780
 Create a technology that for the first time in wireless,

06:29.780 --> 06:32.980
 you could deliver mission critical services.

06:32.980 --> 06:37.180
 Wireless used to up to 4G is its best effort.

06:37.180 --> 06:40.500
 In 5G, it can guarantee that you are connected

06:40.500 --> 06:41.340
 with the cloud.

06:41.340 --> 06:46.340
 And then the last point of that is provide this fabric

06:47.260 --> 06:50.660
 that will allow us as a society to look at things

06:50.660 --> 06:53.260
 that are not connected and say, that's the exception.

06:53.260 --> 06:57.100
 That's why we made a comparison in the early days of 5G

06:57.100 --> 06:58.580
 that that's gonna be like electricity.

06:58.580 --> 07:00.940
 Right now, you don't have a discussion

07:00.940 --> 07:03.300
 about what is the use cases for electricity.

07:03.300 --> 07:04.700
 You don't talk about that anymore.

07:04.700 --> 07:05.860
 You just assume it's there.

07:05.860 --> 07:08.100
 And that's how we think about everything

07:08.100 --> 07:09.420
 connected to the cloud.

07:09.420 --> 07:12.260
 That's what 5G is and that's the role of 5G.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.380
 So first of all, everything connected to the cloud

07:15.380 --> 07:17.540
 is interesting because the space of everything

07:17.540 --> 07:19.020
 is constantly increasing.

07:19.020 --> 07:20.540
 That is correct.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.700
 I don't think the refrigerator over there,

07:22.700 --> 07:23.540
 it looks kind of smart,

07:23.540 --> 07:27.020
 but I don't think it's connected yet to the cloud.

07:27.020 --> 07:29.500
 So this includes internet of things.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.620
 What is the full space of everything?

07:31.620 --> 07:33.860
 The full space of everything is,

07:33.860 --> 07:38.500
 it's maybe going back to where you start defining Qualcomm.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.900
 Qualcomm is about communications and advanced computers

07:41.900 --> 07:43.820
 for low power devices.

07:43.820 --> 07:46.620
 And can we make everything smart?

07:46.620 --> 07:51.140
 It can range from the robot you have right now on the floor

07:51.140 --> 07:54.740
 to your refrigerator, to a camera,

07:54.740 --> 07:59.740
 to machines in manufacturing,

08:00.980 --> 08:03.500
 to retail, et cetera.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.460
 I can give you some examples.

08:05.460 --> 08:08.260
 When we think of something as simple

08:08.260 --> 08:11.260
 as going to the grocery shop,

08:11.260 --> 08:14.540
 we see technology now with something,

08:14.540 --> 08:17.620
 the stuff we've been working with companies like Walmart.

08:17.620 --> 08:19.540
 Electronic shelf labels.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.620
 The ability for you to have smart cameras,

08:21.620 --> 08:24.380
 they can look at shelves and the camera is smart enough

08:24.380 --> 08:27.020
 to say some product needs to be replenished.

08:27.020 --> 08:28.220
 Ability to see what's trashed.

08:28.220 --> 08:32.580
 So it's about really providing processor connectivity,

08:32.580 --> 08:35.300
 artificial intelligence to everything.

08:35.300 --> 08:40.180
 And I think that's one of the largest addressable markets

08:40.180 --> 08:41.180
 we have for technology

08:41.180 --> 08:43.340
 because you can't really define everything.

08:43.340 --> 08:44.260
 Right, exactly.

08:44.260 --> 08:45.100
 It's a nice market

08:45.100 --> 08:48.020
 because it keeps growing potentially exponentially in speed.

08:49.660 --> 08:51.100
 What about coverage?

08:51.100 --> 08:53.180
 So how are we doing on the everything part?

08:53.180 --> 08:57.620
 So there is, like I mentioned, sub six gigahertz 5G

08:57.620 --> 09:00.100
 and there's a millimeter wave 5G.

09:00.100 --> 09:02.780
 So not all 5G is made the same.

09:02.780 --> 09:05.460
 So there's a speed, there's a bandwidth thing.

09:05.460 --> 09:06.780
 And then there's coverage.

09:06.780 --> 09:10.220
 How many people get to enjoy today

09:10.220 --> 09:13.420
 and how does the progress in the next five, 10, 20, 30,

09:13.420 --> 09:15.820
 50 years you think looks like in terms of coverage?

09:15.820 --> 09:17.060
 Great topic of conversation.

09:17.060 --> 09:18.300
 So let's talk about this.

09:19.180 --> 09:23.020
 When I meet with regulators across the globe,

09:23.020 --> 09:26.140
 I tell them resistance is futile.

09:26.140 --> 09:29.020
 Allocate every spectrum to wireless.

09:29.020 --> 09:31.660
 Every spectrum needs to be allocated to wireless.

09:31.660 --> 09:36.660
 The reality is when we start moving from CDMA to OFDMA,

09:37.500 --> 09:41.820
 we knew that this industry has done a lot

09:41.820 --> 09:44.020
 to get more bits per Hertz.

09:44.020 --> 09:49.020
 But the reality is the massive amount of improvements

09:49.020 --> 09:53.700
 that is required in capacity and in speed,

09:53.700 --> 09:55.380
 you need more spectrum.

09:55.380 --> 10:00.100
 There's not so much we can rely on more bits per Hertz.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.620
 You just need more spectrum.

10:01.620 --> 10:04.300
 And if you look, for example,

10:04.300 --> 10:07.780
 what carriers since the 2G era,

10:07.780 --> 10:10.740
 they participate in different license and auctions

10:10.740 --> 10:15.740
 and every spectrum they accumulated from 2G or 3G or 4G,

10:15.740 --> 10:20.740
 all of that, you may be able to get one or two channels max

10:20.980 --> 10:24.380
 of sub six, which is a channel is about 100 megahertz

10:24.380 --> 10:26.740
 or 200 megahertz, and that's it.

10:26.740 --> 10:28.740
 So we need more spectrum.

10:28.740 --> 10:32.340
 So 5G has been designed to work across every spectrum

10:32.340 --> 10:36.980
 from the low frequency bands, that's what we call the sub six,

10:36.980 --> 10:40.340
 but you needed more, you needed to go to the millimeter wave.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.820
 So that's why 5G is a technology that you can deploy

10:43.820 --> 10:48.820
 from 450 megahertz as an example, or 600 or 700,

10:48.820 --> 10:53.820
 all the way to in the 42 gigahertz.

10:54.100 --> 10:57.180
 And that's where millimeter wave comes into the picture.

10:57.180 --> 11:00.620
 Now, let's now connect this to your question

11:00.620 --> 11:03.580
 about coverage of 5G.

11:03.580 --> 11:08.420
 The easiest thing to do is to deploy 5G

11:08.420 --> 11:10.620
 in the new spectrum you can get,

11:10.620 --> 11:14.180
 which is in the sub six, you see bands being auctioned

11:14.180 --> 11:17.500
 across the globe into 3.5 gigahertz.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.820
 There's nothing special about the band,

11:18.820 --> 11:20.260
 it's just the only one that was available

11:20.260 --> 11:22.620
 because everything else has been useful for 4G.

11:22.620 --> 11:26.620
 And you can deploy on that, go into existing cell towers

11:26.620 --> 11:27.940
 and just put a new equipment

11:27.940 --> 11:29.460
 without having to build new towers.

11:29.460 --> 11:32.700
 But when we go to technologies such as millimeter wave,

11:32.700 --> 11:35.260
 then you have to build more dense networks.

11:35.260 --> 11:37.140
 You need to build more stations

11:37.140 --> 11:38.700
 because a deployment in that case

11:38.700 --> 11:40.500
 look like a wifi deployment,

11:40.500 --> 11:42.900
 it's almost like wifi access points.

11:42.900 --> 11:45.940
 When you need to build more stations, you need permits,

11:45.940 --> 11:50.580
 you need to build fiber, so it takes more time to densify.

11:50.580 --> 11:54.260
 So what you see happening is coverage has been built fast

11:54.260 --> 11:56.620
 with sub six across the globe,

11:56.620 --> 11:59.860
 but now the United States also have the sub six.

11:59.860 --> 12:02.940
 So that gets you to coverage very fast.

12:02.940 --> 12:05.620
 But millimeter wave, it's moving.

12:05.620 --> 12:08.780
 And if I will say, for example, Verizon,

12:08.780 --> 12:11.220
 United States has had a leadership

12:11.220 --> 12:13.060
 in building millimeter wave, it takes time.

12:13.060 --> 12:17.020
 I'll say cities like Chicago, Manhattan

12:17.020 --> 12:18.780
 starting to get coverage.

12:18.780 --> 12:21.540
 It will be a process over a number of years

12:21.540 --> 12:26.220
 as you build those different access points type networks,

12:26.220 --> 12:28.500
 but it's inevitable.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.020
 There's not enough spectrum.

12:30.020 --> 12:33.220
 So every 5G operators just a matter of time

12:33.220 --> 12:35.020
 will have millimeter wave as well.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.740
 Resistance is futile.

12:36.740 --> 12:39.300
 Okay, so for millimeter wave,

12:39.300 --> 12:42.140
 we need density of access points.

12:42.140 --> 12:47.140
 And what's the biggest resistance for Qualcomm

12:47.620 --> 12:49.660
 for human civilization?

12:49.660 --> 12:54.500
 Is it politicians, regulators, federal regulators?

12:54.500 --> 12:57.700
 Is it individual humans?

12:57.700 --> 13:00.620
 Is it not enough money from the consumer perspective?

13:00.620 --> 13:03.340
 Like who is the biggest pain in the butt?

13:03.340 --> 13:05.700
 From a Qualcomm standpoint, but answering the question

13:05.700 --> 13:09.420
 about what it takes to build all this technology.

13:09.420 --> 13:11.740
 I think regulators across the board

13:11.740 --> 13:13.660
 understood the importance of 5G.

13:13.660 --> 13:15.940
 I have not met a regulator that said,

13:15.940 --> 13:18.100
 it's really important to be late on 5G.

13:18.100 --> 13:20.140
 I don't think anybody wants to be late on 5G.

13:20.140 --> 13:22.980
 And as a result, we've seen enormous amount of progress

13:22.980 --> 13:26.300
 in getting spectrum allocated to 5G.

13:26.300 --> 13:29.380
 I think the real issue is the time that it takes

13:29.380 --> 13:31.660
 to build infrastructure.

13:31.660 --> 13:34.220
 You know, investment in 5G infrastructure,

13:34.220 --> 13:37.060
 special millimeter wave is like building roads and ports.

13:37.060 --> 13:38.820
 It's critical infrastructure.

13:38.820 --> 13:40.060
 And those things take time.

13:40.060 --> 13:41.660
 Like one of the number one obstacle

13:41.660 --> 13:45.020
 you're gonna hear from operators is site permit.

13:45.020 --> 13:47.780
 You know, sometimes they have to negotiate municipality

13:47.780 --> 13:51.740
 by municipality about permits to get new cell sites.

13:51.740 --> 13:54.220
 But you know, the networks will be densified

13:54.220 --> 13:56.740
 and you're gonna need all of that capacity

13:56.740 --> 14:01.100
 for the promise of the fully immersive augmented reality

14:01.100 --> 14:03.940
 that will replace phones and everything being connected

14:03.940 --> 14:05.580
 100% of the time.

14:05.580 --> 14:07.940
 This would not be a conversation with the CEO

14:07.940 --> 14:12.060
 if I did not ask questions that make you nervous.

14:12.980 --> 14:15.900
 Some people raise concerns about there not being enough

14:15.900 --> 14:19.380
 studies about the effects of 5G on the human body.

14:19.380 --> 14:21.380
 Is 5G safe?

14:21.380 --> 14:26.380
 Look, I have a very simple answer to this question.

14:26.380 --> 14:31.380
 As we build new capabilities, such as 5G,

14:31.380 --> 14:34.700
 power is going down, especially when you think

14:34.700 --> 14:37.940
 about reducing the number of base stations,

14:37.940 --> 14:40.420
 the network's becoming more dense.

14:40.420 --> 14:45.420
 So as you do that, the power becomes lower.

14:45.420 --> 14:49.420
 If your phone radiated from the phone and from the tower,

14:49.420 --> 14:51.220
 as you get closer to the tower,

14:51.220 --> 14:53.460
 you don't need that much power to reach the tower.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.860
 So as we move from 4G to 5G,

14:56.860 --> 15:00.100
 I think we see a reduction in the amount of power

15:00.100 --> 15:02.860
 is required to close the radio link.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.860
 Now, also you have a number of organizations,

15:05.860 --> 15:09.460
 the FCC, for example, has rigorous programs,

15:09.460 --> 15:14.460
 which they do a lot of tests to validate, you know,

15:14.460 --> 15:16.780
 the safety of those devices.

15:16.780 --> 15:20.300
 And I think we have, has been a model for other countries

15:20.300 --> 15:24.060
 to also to adopt the same things.

15:24.060 --> 15:27.540
 Cellular has been around for a number of decades now.

15:27.540 --> 15:32.540
 I think smartphone is our most beloved device today.

15:32.540 --> 15:35.980
 And I would argue how it's difficult

15:35.980 --> 15:37.780
 to answer those questions,

15:37.780 --> 15:41.380
 but I'll argue that the data to date

15:41.380 --> 15:45.580
 have we seen in 3G and 4G, you know,

15:45.580 --> 15:50.580
 has shown that a lot of the initial concerns

15:53.500 --> 15:55.060
 were not valid.

15:55.060 --> 15:58.620
 We look at 5G, even though it's new, it's just less power.

15:58.620 --> 16:01.900
 So we look at it from a physics standpoint.

16:01.900 --> 16:05.180
 So from a physics, from a biology perspective,

16:05.180 --> 16:08.740
 there's a lot of evidence, there's studies

16:08.740 --> 16:13.060
 that show that it's not dangerous, that it is in fact safe.

16:13.060 --> 16:14.640
 However, the concern that people have

16:14.640 --> 16:17.140
 is when you scale technology exponentially,

16:18.620 --> 16:20.740
 how will that change human civilization?

16:20.740 --> 16:22.340
 I mean, that doesn't apply to 5G,

16:22.340 --> 16:23.980
 that applies to every technology.

16:23.980 --> 16:27.300
 How, you said smartphone is the most beloved device,

16:27.300 --> 16:29.940
 but love sometimes hurts.

16:29.940 --> 16:33.380
 That's the impact on society we don't know.

16:33.380 --> 16:34.700
 And there's a little bit of fear,

16:34.700 --> 16:36.740
 there's both excitement and fear.

16:36.740 --> 16:39.180
 It's a great topic of conversation actually.

16:39.180 --> 16:41.160
 So let me give you my perspective on this.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.500
 And you started to see some things

16:42.500 --> 16:43.700
 actually happening right now.

16:43.700 --> 16:47.140
 So let me step back and let's talk about the fact

16:47.140 --> 16:51.020
 that we are in a fully interconnected society.

16:51.020 --> 16:56.020
 That when you look of the situation today,

16:56.060 --> 17:01.060
 we talk about smartphones, largest development platform,

17:01.700 --> 17:06.700
 so much now of our life, we are connected to the smartphone.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.580
 And we are all connected and we're connected.

17:11.580 --> 17:15.460
 And then we're building digital twins of everything, right?

17:15.460 --> 17:17.340
 So when you look at that picture,

17:17.340 --> 17:20.140
 when you look at the picture of this connected society,

17:21.460 --> 17:25.140
 you started to have the following thoughts,

17:25.140 --> 17:26.780
 which I think are very healthy,

17:26.780 --> 17:30.220
 which means in the same way that in the physical world,

17:30.220 --> 17:33.720
 you're entitled to some rights, you have obligations,

17:33.720 --> 17:38.720
 and there's a lot of things that protect your integrity.

17:38.720 --> 17:43.580
 I think as a rule, we're gonna see the society evolving.

17:43.580 --> 17:46.740
 So those things extend to your digital being

17:47.680 --> 17:49.340
 of people and things.

17:49.340 --> 17:50.720
 And I think it's just natural.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.140
 It's just natural.

17:52.140 --> 17:54.020
 It's just a natural path.

17:54.020 --> 17:55.540
 And you started to see things like that.

17:55.540 --> 18:00.020
 For example, the Europeans has done a lot in this area.

18:00.020 --> 18:03.940
 I'll say the Europeans probably ahead in the United States

18:03.940 --> 18:06.940
 thinking about privacy laws, digital privacy laws.

18:06.940 --> 18:09.860
 Most recently, the DMA, the Digital Markets Act,

18:09.860 --> 18:11.860
 which I think is a great thing.

18:11.860 --> 18:15.900
 I think we believe there's incredible thought

18:15.900 --> 18:19.260
 into enable ability to regulate the digital markets

18:19.260 --> 18:21.100
 so that there's innovation and competitions

18:21.100 --> 18:24.860
 and not a single company can control all the data

18:24.860 --> 18:28.620
 and then decide how things are gonna be work

18:28.620 --> 18:29.740
 on the digital realm.

18:29.740 --> 18:32.060
 And even if we think about the potential things

18:32.060 --> 18:32.900
 like the metaverse,

18:32.900 --> 18:35.480
 as we're connecting physical and digital spaces.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.500
 So I think it's a natural evolution.

18:37.500 --> 18:42.500
 Of course, regulation and laws always follow technology.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.620
 But the fact that we're moving

18:45.620 --> 18:49.440
 to an interconnected society, there's no going back.

18:49.440 --> 18:52.040
 We are a fully interconnected society.

18:52.040 --> 18:55.180
 But there is opportunity to think about

18:55.180 --> 18:58.980
 how the digital twin should,

18:58.980 --> 19:00.860
 people and government should think about it

19:00.860 --> 19:03.380
 so that we get the best of a technology

19:03.380 --> 19:05.280
 without any downside.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.900
 Yeah, so when you say digital twin,

19:06.900 --> 19:08.500
 that's one of the other things you're excited about,

19:08.500 --> 19:09.780
 which is the metaverse,

19:09.780 --> 19:13.380
 or basically building worlds in the digital space.

19:13.380 --> 19:14.700
 And you have to start to think about

19:14.700 --> 19:18.500
 all the basic human rights that transfer

19:18.500 --> 19:20.520
 from our physical meat vehicles

19:20.520 --> 19:22.940
 out to the digital copies of ourselves,

19:22.940 --> 19:24.220
 representations of ourselves.

19:24.220 --> 19:25.740
 It's really important to think about.

19:25.740 --> 19:27.820
 The thing you mentioned about regulators that has been,

19:27.820 --> 19:29.740
 this is me speaking frustrating,

19:29.740 --> 19:32.820
 is like you said, they follow technology.

19:32.820 --> 19:36.940
 So sometimes they don't get the technology at all.

19:36.940 --> 19:40.220
 So they're very clumsy in writing laws

19:40.220 --> 19:43.760
 that censor that technology in interesting ways.

19:43.760 --> 19:47.360
 They mean good, but they can do a lot of unintended damage.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.500
 Now, both, it's a dance.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.660
 It's a beautiful dance,

19:50.660 --> 19:54.120
 but I just wish governments were better dance partners.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.860
 I just see what they're kind of writing now

19:55.860 --> 20:00.380
 about regulating social media and platforms like YouTube,

20:00.380 --> 20:02.460
 and it's just really, really clumsy.

20:02.460 --> 20:04.620
 They don't understand how machine learning works.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.260
 I recommend their systems work.

20:06.260 --> 20:08.960
 And I just wish they kind of caught up a little more

20:08.960 --> 20:12.900
 because it's really important to be great at regulation,

20:12.900 --> 20:15.540
 but also it's important to let companies flourish

20:15.540 --> 20:17.500
 and embrace this new wave of technology.

20:17.500 --> 20:20.420
 That weird dance, I am more and more learning

20:20.420 --> 20:22.620
 looking at public policy,

20:22.620 --> 20:25.620
 how much positive government can do

20:25.620 --> 20:28.060
 and how much clumsy negative it can do,

20:28.060 --> 20:31.240
 unintentionally, just out of sheer incompetence

20:31.240 --> 20:33.120
 or lack of curiosity about tech.

20:34.180 --> 20:36.900
 That's my rant about regulators.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.380
 I think it's a valid point.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.300
 As I said before, I think the Europeans

20:41.300 --> 20:43.460
 probably have a very good framework,

20:43.460 --> 20:46.220
 but the way I'll think about it,

20:46.220 --> 20:50.260
 we depend on having the ability to innovate.

20:50.260 --> 20:51.580
 We depend on the free markets.

20:51.580 --> 20:56.580
 We depend on the ability to create technology

20:56.700 --> 20:59.300
 that will be disruptive.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.140
 But at the same time, I think the tech companies

21:01.140 --> 21:04.860
 probably should spend time helping governments understand,

21:04.860 --> 21:06.980
 helping understand ahead of time

21:06.980 --> 21:08.880
 so that they can be better prepared.

21:09.980 --> 21:13.780
 Let's talk about one of my favorite topics, Snapdragon.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.380
 So Snapdragon is a system on a chip.

21:17.380 --> 21:20.540
 This processor has probably powered billions of smartphones

21:21.420 --> 21:23.940
 over its pretty long history now,

21:23.940 --> 21:26.120
 a decade and a half maybe.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.320
 So it's constantly iterating.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.540
 There's constantly just like a turmoil of beautiful

21:29.540 --> 21:30.660
 innovations happening.

21:30.660 --> 21:34.220
 So last year it was Snapdragon 888 was the main one

21:34.220 --> 21:35.700
 with the five nanometer,

21:35.700 --> 21:40.100
 and this year it's Snapdragon 8Gen1.

21:40.100 --> 21:41.700
 It's a new naming scheme.

21:41.700 --> 21:44.820
 Okay, what's the sexiest, most beautiful idea

21:44.820 --> 21:47.060
 or concept to you about Snapdragon?

21:47.060 --> 21:47.980
 Start there.

21:47.980 --> 21:49.100
 The way I would describe it,

21:49.100 --> 21:53.340
 and I think the reason we have been successful with it,

21:53.340 --> 21:58.340
 is to really understand how to build a platform,

21:59.380 --> 22:01.620
 a single chip, like a single chip,

22:02.780 --> 22:06.300
 that will have every single capability

22:06.300 --> 22:08.860
 if you wanna make this smartphone

22:08.860 --> 22:10.140
 in the palm of your hand,

22:11.360 --> 22:13.540
 something that has all of your computing needs.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.220
 And it was the ability to get,

22:15.220 --> 22:17.340
 from an engineering standpoint,

22:17.340 --> 22:20.140
 ability to get into a single chip

22:20.140 --> 22:24.260
 of not only all possible connectivity technology,

22:24.260 --> 22:26.700
 from cellular to wifi to Bluetooth

22:26.700 --> 22:29.980
 to every single constellation of satellites

22:29.980 --> 22:31.540
 for position location.

22:31.540 --> 22:33.580
 But at the same time,

22:33.580 --> 22:38.580
 a very power efficient single thread and multi threaded CPU.

22:39.540 --> 22:44.500
 A GPU for all of your graphic demands,

22:44.500 --> 22:47.620
 gaming, fastest growing segment for gaming,

22:47.620 --> 22:50.100
 is mobile gaming.

22:50.100 --> 22:52.180
 An artificial intelligence processor,

22:52.180 --> 22:55.140
 which we call the neuro processor unit.

22:55.140 --> 22:58.040
 And then a video engine,

22:58.040 --> 23:01.660
 and a multimedia engine for every single application,

23:01.660 --> 23:03.780
 audio, everything.

23:03.780 --> 23:06.460
 So it's a single chip

23:06.460 --> 23:09.380
 that has every single computing technology

23:09.380 --> 23:10.620
 you need in the phone.

23:10.620 --> 23:14.340
 And what's exciting about it is what we already knew.

23:14.340 --> 23:17.340
 For example, when you think about camera or computer vision,

23:17.340 --> 23:20.720
 you see that the advancements in the technology

23:20.720 --> 23:25.120
 now happens in the smartphone first

23:25.120 --> 23:26.360
 versus additional camera.

23:26.360 --> 23:29.160
 So the beauty about the Snapdragon is

23:29.160 --> 23:33.000
 we always have this thing within Qualcomm.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.840
 The phone, it's small.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.240
 You have to be able to hold it.

23:37.240 --> 23:40.600
 You're gonna touch your face so you cannot be hot.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.240
 You have to manage thermals.

23:43.240 --> 23:47.660
 You expect to have a full day of battery life.

23:47.660 --> 23:51.000
 But then you want it to not be sending data

23:51.000 --> 23:53.900
 into 10 or 100 megabits.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.480
 You want gigabits.

23:55.480 --> 23:58.760
 You want it to be able to have eight core processors.

23:58.760 --> 24:01.400
 You want to have a GPU with ray tracing.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.280
 You want to have all of the things

24:03.280 --> 24:08.280
 that you can only get into sometimes a desktop PC.

24:08.520 --> 24:11.340
 And to do all of that in your phone

24:11.340 --> 24:14.140
 and be able to be in the leadership position

24:14.140 --> 24:17.000
 generation after generation is an incredible thing.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.980
 And we're very proud of that at Qualcomm.

24:18.980 --> 24:22.320
 Yeah, so you have to do the WiFi, 5G, all of the...

24:22.320 --> 24:24.960
 And you have to be good to everyone of those technologies.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.280
 And pack it all in.

24:26.280 --> 24:28.760
 And there's also pressure to make the thing

24:28.760 --> 24:30.680
 faster and faster and faster.

24:30.680 --> 24:32.440
 And then there's more and more applications

24:32.440 --> 24:34.800
 you're supposed to be effortlessly using.

24:34.800 --> 24:37.560
 And then you mentioned the NPU, GPU, CPU.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.440
 They have to also dance together somehow.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.800
 They have to communicate well, share memory or not,

24:42.800 --> 24:44.400
 depending on what the application is.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.360
 And your battery has to last all day.

24:48.240 --> 24:49.080
 So think about that.

24:49.080 --> 24:51.840
 From a company like Qualcomm, we have to be good

24:51.840 --> 24:53.760
 in each and every one of those technologies.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.400
 We can't just say, oh, we're a CPU company

24:55.400 --> 24:57.920
 or a GPU company or we're AI company.

24:57.920 --> 24:59.840
 We have to do everything.

24:59.840 --> 25:02.920
 What does it take to design a great processor?

25:02.920 --> 25:06.160
 So design this system on a chip that you mentioned.

25:06.160 --> 25:08.120
 Is there some insight you can provide

25:08.120 --> 25:13.120
 in this chaos of engineers, designers, leaders,

25:15.520 --> 25:16.840
 the people that think about how much

25:16.840 --> 25:19.760
 this is all gonna cost, the whole mess of it?

25:19.760 --> 25:21.760
 I'm, of course, very partial about it.

25:21.760 --> 25:25.000
 I've been in this company for probably more than 26 years.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.500
 But I will argue that there are a couple things

25:28.500 --> 25:31.880
 that are ingredients for success.

25:31.880 --> 25:33.400
 So we talk about the fact that they have

25:33.400 --> 25:34.640
 all those different technologies.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.240
 They evolve at their own pace.

25:36.240 --> 25:38.880
 And you have to be good in each one of them.

25:38.880 --> 25:41.040
 And you need to then to make them working together.

25:41.040 --> 25:44.900
 So you need to have an engineering organization

25:44.900 --> 25:49.900
 that's with an incredible collaboration culture

25:50.560 --> 25:52.600
 because everybody has to be working.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.280
 The train's gonna leave the station.

25:54.280 --> 25:57.720
 Every cart needs to be there when it leaves the station.

25:57.720 --> 25:58.720
 It needs to leave on time,

25:58.720 --> 26:00.280
 especially in the phone business.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.220
 You can't change Christmas.

26:02.220 --> 26:04.060
 You cannot change Black Friday.

26:04.060 --> 26:06.480
 You cannot change all of the selling seasons.

26:06.480 --> 26:08.960
 So the phones are gonna launch on time.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.280
 And every technology needs to be there.

26:10.280 --> 26:12.760
 The engineer needs to work as one.

26:12.760 --> 26:14.620
 And we do have that at Qualcomm.

26:14.620 --> 26:18.440
 The other thing, you have to have incredible discipline

26:18.440 --> 26:22.680
 because those are very complex systems.

26:22.680 --> 26:26.960
 So in one way, you have to design with quality

26:28.320 --> 26:32.080
 because in many cases, we're gonna be ramping production.

26:32.080 --> 26:34.760
 And even before we have the silicon back

26:34.760 --> 26:38.400
 and you have to rely on our simulation models

26:38.400 --> 26:41.480
 and you have to rely on the fact

26:41.480 --> 26:45.060
 that you design for commercial applications.

26:45.060 --> 26:48.200
 That takes a while to build.

26:48.200 --> 26:52.120
 And it's probably been the history

26:52.120 --> 26:54.140
 of a semiconductor business at Qualcomm.

26:54.140 --> 26:55.480
 So you mean like the framework

26:55.480 --> 26:57.680
 of how many people can use simulation software

26:57.680 --> 26:59.960
 and all that kind of stuff to build the thing

26:59.960 --> 27:02.840
 with a hard deadline that you might not even get back

27:02.840 --> 27:05.720
 from like manufacturer before.

27:06.760 --> 27:08.200
 You're not allowed to have any mistakes.

27:08.200 --> 27:11.080
 No wonder our name is quality communications.

27:11.080 --> 27:13.440
 Oh, I never even thought about the qual part.

27:13.440 --> 27:14.600
 Quality.

27:14.600 --> 27:17.400
 So quality and there's a bar that's high

27:17.400 --> 27:19.040
 and you're not allowed to mess up.

27:19.040 --> 27:21.000
 I mean, to me as an engineer, that's exciting.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.800
 Hard deadlines, no room for mistakes.

27:25.800 --> 27:26.640
 I love it.

27:26.640 --> 27:27.960
 Super stressful, but I love it.

27:27.960 --> 27:31.960
 So there's a couple of other small companies

27:33.760 --> 27:36.200
 called Google and Apple.

27:36.200 --> 27:39.440
 So Google is now using its own chip for the Pixel 6.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.560
 Apple using its own.

27:41.560 --> 27:45.680
 How does Qualcomm out compete Google and Apple?

27:45.680 --> 27:46.840
 How does it beat them?

27:46.840 --> 27:48.520
 We don't have to out compete Google.

27:48.520 --> 27:51.240
 Actually, if you look at our mobile strategy today,

27:51.240 --> 27:53.640
 and then one thing I was very clear when I became CEO,

27:53.640 --> 27:55.240
 I think there's a lot of confusion in the market.

27:55.240 --> 27:58.080
 Our mobile strategy is very clear.

27:58.080 --> 28:02.000
 We are focused of making Snapdragon synonymous

28:02.000 --> 28:04.840
 with premium Android experience.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.160
 That's what Snapdragon is.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.400
 Android, the phone of the people.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.240
 Yes.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.120
 I just have a love for Android.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.920
 I'm constantly talking trash to iPhone people.

28:13.920 --> 28:14.760
 Sorry, go ahead.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.640
 Premium Android experiences.

28:16.640 --> 28:20.680
 So we do produce Snapdragon in multiple tier

28:20.680 --> 28:23.640
 for every price point, but every year,

28:23.640 --> 28:26.120
 you mentioned the HN1,

28:26.120 --> 28:29.720
 and every year we'll provide the flagship product.

28:29.720 --> 28:33.960
 And then the other series that is trying to get the best

28:33.960 --> 28:36.680
 of every possible technology at that time.

28:36.680 --> 28:41.520
 And it's really focused on enabling the Android ecosystem.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.920
 So I'll give an example.

28:42.920 --> 28:45.400
 So you asked me the question, how to compete with Google.

28:45.400 --> 28:46.640
 It's not about competing with Google.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.600
 We're the number one enabler

28:48.600 --> 28:51.840
 of the Google Android ecosystem.

28:51.840 --> 28:56.320
 And the largest, the number one customer there

28:56.320 --> 28:58.200
 is actually Samsung.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.760
 And if you look what happened to Samsung,

29:00.760 --> 29:04.040
 Samsung, I always said,

29:05.440 --> 29:08.800
 since I began my relationship with them,

29:08.800 --> 29:10.440
 that cause they always had their own chip.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.120
 They always had their own chip.

29:12.120 --> 29:14.800
 And if you'll just look at what happened right now

29:14.800 --> 29:17.960
 with the Galaxy S22 that just launched,

29:17.960 --> 29:21.600
 they used to balance their business about 50% Qualcomm.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.640
 They will get the most advanced markets

29:23.640 --> 29:27.000
 like the United States and China and Japan and Korea,

29:27.000 --> 29:28.440
 they will assign to Qualcomm.

29:28.440 --> 29:31.320
 And then they'll have their own chip for the markets

29:31.320 --> 29:34.040
 that they would be like more emerging markets,

29:34.040 --> 29:35.920
 open markets, markets that they have a control

29:35.920 --> 29:38.440
 on the channel because they sell a lot of appliances

29:38.440 --> 29:39.840
 and other things.

29:39.840 --> 29:42.360
 If you look what happened right now, GS22,

29:42.360 --> 29:46.480
 75% is Qualcomm.

29:46.480 --> 29:51.480
 And then the next large OEMs and Android ecosystem

29:51.680 --> 29:52.920
 are the Chinese ones.

29:52.920 --> 29:56.600
 Companies like Xiaomi, one of the fastest growing.

29:56.600 --> 30:00.320
 It was number one in Europe at some point last year,

30:00.320 --> 30:03.720
 then followed by Oppo and OnePlus and Vivo.

30:03.720 --> 30:06.640
 So those are some of the largest Qualcomm customers.

30:06.640 --> 30:11.640
 And they actually drive the Android ecosystem.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.200
 And that's our mobile strategy

30:14.200 --> 30:18.720
 and fully aligned with Google and it's working.

30:18.720 --> 30:23.720
 And not to get into a lot of the investor conversation,

30:24.000 --> 30:29.000
 but we're also happy we became a beneficiary

30:29.440 --> 30:31.920
 of the shifts that we saw in the marketplace.

30:31.920 --> 30:35.120
 As Huawei became a smaller OEM

30:35.120 --> 30:37.400
 as a result of the sanctions,

30:37.400 --> 30:42.200
 we saw the rise of a lot of the other OEMs from China,

30:42.200 --> 30:46.160
 especially for China domestic market, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo.

30:46.160 --> 30:47.960
 They moved to the premium category

30:47.960 --> 30:49.600
 and they're all doing that with Qualcomm.

30:49.600 --> 30:53.120
 So we're actually very fortunate and happy

30:53.120 --> 30:55.760
 with the position we are in mobile business.

30:55.760 --> 30:57.680
 We do have an Apple relationship.

30:57.680 --> 31:01.000
 We provide modem technology to Apple.

31:02.480 --> 31:03.720
 It's a multi year relationship.

31:03.720 --> 31:07.160
 Apple has been very public that they are investing

31:07.160 --> 31:09.480
 to develop their own modem.

31:09.480 --> 31:12.840
 But the Qualcomm strategy has been clear.

31:12.840 --> 31:15.360
 We're really focused on Snapdragon.

31:16.360 --> 31:18.480
 Our mobile strategy is not defined

31:18.480 --> 31:20.840
 by providing a cellular modem to Apple.

31:20.840 --> 31:23.120
 Our mobile strategy is this that we just talked about it.

31:23.120 --> 31:25.200
 It's about the unique thing of Snapdragon

31:25.200 --> 31:27.360
 that has every single technology

31:27.360 --> 31:29.700
 integrated into a single SOC.

31:29.700 --> 31:32.160
 And provides a premium experience.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.400
 And that's what we're doing

31:33.400 --> 31:37.000
 and focusing on the Android ecosystem.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.720
 I don't know if I can ask you this kind of question.

31:39.720 --> 31:42.240
 It's like picking your children or something like this.

31:42.240 --> 31:45.640
 But what smartphone with a Snapdragon?

31:45.640 --> 31:49.240
 You mentioned Samsung Galaxy S22, OnePlus.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.560
 Those are phones I personally really enjoy.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.380
 What phone do you currently use?

31:54.380 --> 31:55.720
 Or do you have multiple phones?

31:55.720 --> 31:59.720
 I do have multiple phones but I do use Galaxy S22.

31:59.720 --> 32:01.020
 That's your favorite one?

32:01.020 --> 32:03.440
 All right, well you heard it here first folks.

32:03.440 --> 32:04.860
 Okay, so excellent.

32:04.860 --> 32:09.860
 Can Qualcomm also, let's take a brief step away from mobile.

32:09.920 --> 32:13.560
 And take on Intel and Apple and other such companies

32:13.560 --> 32:15.240
 in the laptop and desktop space.

32:15.240 --> 32:18.700
 So the nature of what a computer is seems to be changing.

32:18.700 --> 32:21.320
 It's like smartphones like merging.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.840
 It's all being a smartphone just with the biggest screen

32:23.840 --> 32:24.680
 or something like this.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.740
 So what does the future of that look like?

32:26.740 --> 32:28.400
 Before I answer that question,

32:28.400 --> 32:30.440
 let me just step back a little bit.

32:30.440 --> 32:33.560
 Because, and I'm sure we can talk more about those things.

32:33.560 --> 32:37.920
 But the reality is Qualcomm is changing a lot.

32:37.920 --> 32:40.120
 And we use, I know we spend a lot of time

32:40.120 --> 32:42.760
 talking about 5G and smartphone and Snapdragon.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.480
 And I think that has been what had defined Qualcomm

32:45.480 --> 32:46.320
 for many years.

32:46.320 --> 32:48.720
 But the reality is, even consistent

32:48.720 --> 32:51.580
 with that 5G conversation, which is a technology

32:51.580 --> 32:56.400
 to connect everything, Qualcomm is also changing.

32:56.400 --> 33:00.820
 Our technology that was in many cases designed for phones.

33:00.820 --> 33:05.360
 And we said at the beginning, connectivity and processing.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.880
 It's going to virtually every industry.

33:07.880 --> 33:12.040
 And as a result, Qualcomm is really changing with it

33:12.040 --> 33:15.760
 and expanding to a number of different addressable markets.

33:15.760 --> 33:20.760
 Some of those markets is the PC, as you talk about it.

33:21.060 --> 33:24.580
 The conversions of mobile and PC.

33:24.580 --> 33:27.000
 And the reason I'm excited about this,

33:27.000 --> 33:28.840
 because you see a lot of things happening

33:28.840 --> 33:31.680
 that bring this right front and center

33:31.680 --> 33:33.440
 when you think about the future technology.

33:33.440 --> 33:37.560
 So what we learn with the pandemic

33:37.560 --> 33:42.020
 is that the number one use case of personal computers

33:42.020 --> 33:43.780
 is communications.

33:45.040 --> 33:46.480
 It is interesting when you think about that.

33:46.480 --> 33:49.400
 That's the number one use case on a PC today

33:49.400 --> 33:50.720
 is communications.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.600
 It's actually funny because in the cellular industry,

33:53.600 --> 33:55.240
 actually I'll say, let me step back.

33:55.240 --> 33:59.240
 In the telecom industry, we've been chasing

33:59.240 --> 34:03.720
 this killer application of video telephony for decades.

34:03.720 --> 34:08.060
 I remember back then in the wire line,

34:08.060 --> 34:11.440
 even before the internet and IP, ISDN,

34:11.440 --> 34:15.480
 you remember those AT&T desk phones with a little screen

34:15.480 --> 34:17.200
 and they said, you can do video telephony.

34:17.200 --> 34:21.340
 We don't watch that in Back to the Future 2.

34:21.340 --> 34:23.520
 Then when we started developing 3G,

34:23.520 --> 34:25.680
 people said, what's the application for having data

34:25.680 --> 34:26.520
 to a cell phone?

34:26.520 --> 34:27.600
 All video telephony.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.340
 Then we started doing 4G.

34:30.320 --> 34:32.120
 And in the beginning, people said,

34:32.120 --> 34:33.700
 well, why do you need all of this broadband?

34:33.700 --> 34:35.440
 All video telephony.

34:35.440 --> 34:39.120
 But it took a pandemic to make video telephony

34:39.120 --> 34:40.600
 the killer application.

34:40.600 --> 34:44.860
 And that's now the number one use case on a PC.

34:44.860 --> 34:47.280
 So now think about that for a second.

34:47.280 --> 34:49.440
 Personal computers now, they're technologies

34:49.440 --> 34:50.900
 that people when they were gonna buy a PC,

34:50.900 --> 34:51.880
 they didn't care much about it.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.880
 Now they do, camera.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.760
 Camera, how good is the camera?

34:55.760 --> 34:57.900
 The audio, is that connected?

34:57.900 --> 34:58.920
 How good is the connectivity?

34:58.920 --> 35:01.960
 Do you have the latest and greatest wifi and cellular?

35:01.960 --> 35:03.360
 What's the battery life?

35:03.360 --> 35:04.940
 Because you're gonna be working from anywhere.

35:04.940 --> 35:07.260
 Sometimes you know that, sometimes you're not.

35:07.260 --> 35:09.720
 So all those things, what's the portability like?

35:09.720 --> 35:11.640
 So those things started to change

35:11.640 --> 35:13.720
 how we should think about the PC.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.360
 But I won't stop there.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.080
 Let me talk about another trend.

35:17.080 --> 35:21.800
 So, and all come as a result of what we saw the pandemic.

35:21.800 --> 35:23.440
 Let's say that you are,

35:23.440 --> 35:25.720
 you're an engineer, you do computer aided design.

35:25.720 --> 35:30.340
 You have an advanced desktop computer

35:30.340 --> 35:33.080
 or workstation in your office.

35:33.080 --> 35:35.160
 But you wanna work from home someday.

35:35.160 --> 35:37.240
 So you're not gonna move that to your home.

35:37.240 --> 35:38.120
 So what do you need to do?

35:38.120 --> 35:40.280
 You're gonna have to rely on that.

35:40.280 --> 35:41.840
 You're gonna run that on the cloud.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.120
 And you're gonna run it on the cloud.

35:43.120 --> 35:44.800
 You need high bandwidth

35:44.800 --> 35:46.720
 because you almost wanted the cloud

35:46.720 --> 35:50.360
 to be the same as your computer for that use case.

35:50.360 --> 35:53.600
 That's the 5G on demand computing use case.

35:53.600 --> 35:57.220
 The use 5G is almost a link between two computers.

35:57.220 --> 35:59.640
 But then, you know, CIOs are saying,

35:59.640 --> 36:02.320
 well, my workforce is going home for certain days.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.560
 I want all the data to be in the cloud.

36:04.560 --> 36:07.040
 You look at, for example, Microsoft OneDrive

36:07.040 --> 36:10.320
 or the ability to collaborate, you need the bandwidth.

36:10.320 --> 36:13.840
 So when you put all of those things together,

36:13.840 --> 36:17.240
 you start thinking about what is the next generation PC?

36:17.240 --> 36:19.120
 And that's the opportunity for Qualcomm.

36:19.120 --> 36:21.120
 I'll just give an example.

36:21.120 --> 36:26.120
 Back in Mobile World Congress recently, Lenovo,

36:26.880 --> 36:31.880
 they have a line of enterprise laptops called the ThinkPad.

36:32.560 --> 36:34.040
 I'm sure you're familiar with it.

36:34.040 --> 36:38.280
 So they announced the ThinkPad based on Snapdragon.

36:38.280 --> 36:42.960
 With 5G on, 28 hours of battery life.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.800
 So that's next generation.

36:45.800 --> 36:49.160
 It's just a nice screen with extremely high, nice screen

36:49.160 --> 36:52.360
 and keyboard, and extremely high connectivity

36:52.360 --> 36:54.920
 to maybe an even more, like a more powerful machine

36:54.920 --> 36:55.760
 in the cloud.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.920
 Something more, the data, connecting to the data,

36:57.920 --> 36:59.600
 connecting to compute, all that kind of stuff.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.560
 You have the camera capabilities,

37:01.560 --> 37:03.240
 and let me go one step more.

37:03.240 --> 37:05.720
 Microsoft talking about some of the other features

37:05.720 --> 37:10.720
 they're doing now using, on Windows 11, using Snapdragon.

37:10.980 --> 37:12.000
 Remember, we talk about it,

37:12.000 --> 37:15.620
 Snapdragon has an AI processor inside there.

37:15.620 --> 37:19.120
 So one of the cool features Microsoft's talking about it is

37:19.120 --> 37:22.000
 you can be on a Teams call, and you can make sure

37:22.000 --> 37:25.760
 your eyes are looking at the camera 100% of the time.

37:25.760 --> 37:27.160
 Well, that's an interesting,

37:27.160 --> 37:28.000
 so they can be talking about that.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.320
 And you do that with AI.

37:29.320 --> 37:32.160
 Yes, that's really tricky to pull off.

37:32.160 --> 37:34.080
 For example, the reason I'm a huge stickler

37:34.080 --> 37:36.640
 for doing these in person, these conversations in person,

37:36.640 --> 37:38.280
 it's really tough to get right.

37:38.280 --> 37:39.960
 But it's a worthy challenge.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.820
 So that's where the metaverse hopes to,

37:41.820 --> 37:43.900
 so like, I just, because you said the importance

37:43.900 --> 37:46.320
 of this telephony of humans connecting,

37:46.320 --> 37:48.760
 teleporting themselves, getting that right

37:48.760 --> 37:49.920
 is really difficult.

37:49.920 --> 37:52.120
 There's a lot of people hate Zoom meetings,

37:52.120 --> 37:55.480
 but that doesn't mean you can't improve that experience

37:55.480 --> 37:57.240
 and get rid of the hate.

37:57.240 --> 37:59.120
 A lot of people hate talking to their car too,

37:59.120 --> 38:02.060
 because the voice, the natural language processing

38:02.060 --> 38:04.920
 is terrible, but when it's not, it's a beautiful thing.

38:04.920 --> 38:06.120
 So getting that right is.

38:06.120 --> 38:08.400
 This is an opportunity, this is an opportunity.

38:08.400 --> 38:10.520
 Think about it, it starts with the PC,

38:10.520 --> 38:14.320
 making the PC giving you a better experience for teams,

38:14.320 --> 38:18.200
 but then it goes right back into this trend

38:18.200 --> 38:20.520
 of connecting physical and digital spaces.

38:20.520 --> 38:23.240
 And all the work we're doing with the metaverse

38:23.240 --> 38:25.280
 and virtual reality and metareality in the future

38:25.280 --> 38:28.680
 is why not call somebody or connect with somebody

38:28.680 --> 38:30.420
 with a hologram, it's possible.

38:30.420 --> 38:33.840
 And also to mention some increasing amount

38:33.840 --> 38:36.080
 of intelligence in our cars.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.080
 So semi autonomous, autonomous cars,

38:38.080 --> 38:41.840
 and the interactivity between human and car,

38:41.840 --> 38:44.920
 which for me, things are really exciting.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.080
 Let me ask you a big question.

38:46.080 --> 38:49.600
 So when aliens again now on the other side, right,

38:49.600 --> 38:51.720
 and humans destroy themselves through nuclear war

38:51.720 --> 38:52.760
 centuries from now.

38:52.760 --> 38:53.600
 Let's hope not.

38:53.600 --> 38:54.420
 Let's hope not.

38:54.420 --> 38:56.200
 But in case, you know, let's just hypothetical

38:56.200 --> 38:57.040
 thought experiment.

38:57.040 --> 39:00.400
 And they write a history of humanity in the 21st century.

39:01.720 --> 39:05.560
 What would they remember Qualcomm in the 21st century

39:05.560 --> 39:06.400
 as a company?

39:06.400 --> 39:08.160
 Would it be a car company?

39:08.160 --> 39:10.720
 Like think of all the crazy pivots that might happen

39:10.720 --> 39:13.240
 in the next like 50 years.

39:13.240 --> 39:15.840
 Because you're thinking, you said Qualcomm enables

39:15.840 --> 39:18.680
 all of these things with 5G and there'll be probably

39:18.680 --> 39:20.920
 other Gs, it keeps increasing.

39:20.920 --> 39:23.640
 So basically connectivity and computation

39:23.640 --> 39:25.800
 and everything becomes connected and everything

39:25.800 --> 39:27.720
 is capable of computation.

39:27.720 --> 39:30.920
 Might you become a robotics and car company?

39:30.920 --> 39:35.920
 I will argue we're already an automotive company today.

39:36.600 --> 39:40.420
 But let me tell you what I would like Qualcomm to be,

39:40.420 --> 39:42.040
 remember and recognize for.

39:43.040 --> 39:47.040
 I think everyone that knows Qualcomm immediately,

39:47.040 --> 39:49.920
 you know, connect us, pun intended,

39:49.920 --> 39:52.040
 to connectivity and wireless.

39:52.040 --> 39:54.840
 But the reality is we're being actually the company

39:54.840 --> 39:58.760
 providing intelligence and processing to everything

39:58.760 --> 40:01.960
 on the edge, everything outside the data center

40:01.960 --> 40:02.920
 that we're doing.

40:02.920 --> 40:05.820
 Those billions of devices that are gonna be connected.

40:05.820 --> 40:08.780
 And that's kind of explained when we talk about

40:08.780 --> 40:11.580
 the connected intelligent edge, the beyond phones,

40:11.580 --> 40:13.960
 cars, species, and all of those.

40:13.960 --> 40:16.520
 And the broader IOTs, we talk about everything

40:16.520 --> 40:18.040
 will be connected and intelligent.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.880
 And that's what we want Qualcomm to be recognized for.

40:20.880 --> 40:23.120
 So by the way, for people who are not familiar,

40:23.120 --> 40:25.000
 there's some technical jargon.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.520
 People use the word edge, like edge computing.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.720
 It's, by the way, that's probably changing

40:30.720 --> 40:31.960
 what that even means.

40:31.960 --> 40:34.040
 But it's basically everything that's not a giant thing

40:34.040 --> 40:36.280
 that's making a lot of noise in a building somewhere.

40:36.280 --> 40:39.940
 So it's mobile devices and the mobile devices

40:39.940 --> 40:42.440
 of all kinds, well, a refrigerator's not mobile,

40:42.440 --> 40:43.720
 but it would be edge.

40:43.720 --> 40:46.740
 So it's like what's a sandwich, that kind of discussion.

40:48.640 --> 40:53.160
 But basically edge computing is the edge

40:53.160 --> 40:56.300
 of that expanding space that you mentioned

40:56.300 --> 40:59.240
 that Qualcomm is trying to connect

40:59.240 --> 41:00.680
 and enable with computation.

41:00.680 --> 41:04.000
 Here's a simple way to describe what the edge is

41:04.000 --> 41:05.520
 and edge computing is.

41:05.520 --> 41:08.520
 I think as we think about the evolution of the data center,

41:09.560 --> 41:12.400
 you need to bring the computational closer

41:12.400 --> 41:14.040
 to where the device is.

41:14.040 --> 41:17.000
 Also, when you put the computation together

41:17.000 --> 41:19.720
 with the connectivity at the same time,

41:19.720 --> 41:22.000
 you're gonna see a lot of advancement

41:22.000 --> 41:25.120
 of artificial intelligence happening closer

41:25.120 --> 41:26.760
 or at the device.

41:26.760 --> 41:29.480
 Look, it's a very, I have a simple way to describe it.

41:29.480 --> 41:31.940
 Remember in the beginning of this conversation,

41:31.940 --> 41:35.720
 we talk about in the 4G era, broadband

41:35.720 --> 41:38.920
 and mobile computing evolved side by side.

41:38.920 --> 41:40.000
 If you're gonna have broadband,

41:40.000 --> 41:41.920
 you might as well have a computer in the palm of your hand.

41:41.920 --> 41:45.160
 So we needed to invest in those two technologies.

41:45.160 --> 41:49.840
 In 5G, AI develops side by side.

41:49.840 --> 41:52.480
 You're connected to the cloud 100% of the time.

41:52.480 --> 41:54.400
 You have a high bandwidth and you have now

41:54.400 --> 41:56.880
 a smart and intelligent thing that can make decision

41:56.880 --> 42:00.720
 in real time, provide context information to the cloud

42:00.720 --> 42:02.480
 to make the models more accurate

42:02.480 --> 42:05.240
 and as well compare and contrast to the cloud.

42:05.240 --> 42:08.520
 So there's gonna be an exponential development of AI

42:08.520 --> 42:11.840
 happening with all the edge devices,

42:11.840 --> 42:14.240
 the devices that are outside the data center

42:14.240 --> 42:16.880
 and computation is gonna go alongside that.

42:16.880 --> 42:19.600
 And a great example of that is the car.

42:19.600 --> 42:22.880
 The car, we haven't talked much about the car,

42:22.880 --> 42:26.600
 but Qualcomm is now, you could argue was as much

42:26.600 --> 42:28.680
 as an automotive company as wireless company,

42:28.680 --> 42:32.000
 working 26 global brands.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.440
 And it's easy to see, if you look at our mobile heritage

42:36.440 --> 42:40.900
 and we talk about form factors, thermal, battery life,

42:40.900 --> 42:43.440
 you're not gonna put a server in a trunk of a car,

42:43.440 --> 42:46.520
 but you need as much computational capabilities.

42:46.520 --> 42:49.760
 And that's we see Qualcomm providing,

42:49.760 --> 42:53.120
 as the car become a connected computer on wheels,

42:53.120 --> 42:56.120
 we provide the computational and all the sensors

42:56.120 --> 42:57.680
 for you to do assisted driving

42:57.680 --> 42:59.800
 for the new digital cockpit experience

42:59.800 --> 43:01.560
 connecting the car to the cloud

43:01.560 --> 43:03.960
 and it's all of that's happening at the edge.

43:03.960 --> 43:05.920
 Does Qualcomm want to be the brain

43:05.920 --> 43:07.800
 of a lot of autonomous vehicles in the future

43:07.800 --> 43:10.480
 of different, you said brands, like Mercedes,

43:10.480 --> 43:13.320
 BMW, I don't know, whatever, just whatever car.

43:13.320 --> 43:15.760
 Cars have the sexy thing they do

43:15.760 --> 43:18.520
 and then it defines their brand and so on.

43:18.520 --> 43:19.840
 And then there's the brain

43:19.840 --> 43:22.480
 that doesn't need to have branding supposedly.

43:22.480 --> 43:23.860
 So does Qualcomm see that

43:23.860 --> 43:26.480
 or will I be able to buy a Qualcomm car?

43:26.480 --> 43:27.480
 Like literally it'll be Qualcomm.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.280
 No, you're not gonna be able to buy a Qualcomm car,

43:29.280 --> 43:34.280
 but we are ready on our way to become the brains of the car.

43:35.920 --> 43:38.640
 The way you should think about Qualcomm automotive strategy

43:38.640 --> 43:42.160
 is the car companies realize

43:42.160 --> 43:44.160
 they need to become technology companies.

43:44.160 --> 43:47.120
 You just look, for example, of the market cap

43:47.120 --> 43:50.760
 of some of the new electrical commerce

43:50.760 --> 43:55.680
 and compare them with the legacy car companies.

43:55.680 --> 43:56.520
 Which one is that?

43:56.520 --> 44:00.640
 I heard of, one of them lives in Austin.

44:00.640 --> 44:02.200
 Let's say Rivian, right?

44:02.200 --> 44:03.040
 Rivian.

44:03.040 --> 44:03.880
 Oh, that one too, yes.

44:03.880 --> 44:05.680
 You know, the car companies are not going away.

44:05.680 --> 44:09.640
 It's actually a mistake not to bet in the car companies.

44:09.640 --> 44:12.640
 The car companies need a technology partner.

44:12.640 --> 44:16.680
 They will provide the digital chassis for them.

44:16.680 --> 44:18.120
 And that's what we're doing.

44:18.120 --> 44:19.240
 So if you look at Qualcomm,

44:19.240 --> 44:22.320
 we talk about a Snapdragon digital chassis.

44:22.320 --> 44:27.320
 So we want to be the preferred technology partner

44:27.680 --> 44:30.680
 of the car companies, and I think it's working.

44:30.680 --> 44:32.000
 Strategy is working right now.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.680
 So basically helping the car companies

44:34.680 --> 44:37.680
 accelerate into becoming technology companies.

44:37.680 --> 44:39.380
 Connecting the car to the cloud,

44:39.380 --> 44:42.920
 redesign the interior of the digital cockpit experience,

44:42.920 --> 44:45.520
 and provide the computation and sensor capabilities

44:45.520 --> 44:47.400
 for autonomy and assisted driving.

44:48.280 --> 44:50.800
 On the topic of robots, when millions or billions

44:50.800 --> 44:54.320
 of robots roam the earth in the future among us humans,

44:54.320 --> 44:59.320
 and I am for one concerned in a small percentage,

44:59.560 --> 45:02.200
 but largely I'm excited about that future,

45:02.200 --> 45:07.200
 will Qualcomm be the thing that powers their brain?

45:08.520 --> 45:10.840
 We have in our IoT business,

45:10.840 --> 45:13.860
 which has been one of the fastest growing business for us,

45:13.860 --> 45:16.860
 a number of robotics engagement.

45:16.860 --> 45:18.980
 So I'll give you some example.

45:18.980 --> 45:23.180
 If you look of the Amazon Astro,

45:23.180 --> 45:24.220
 you familiar with that?

45:24.220 --> 45:27.840
 There's two Snapdragon in there.

45:28.860 --> 45:29.700
 There is?

45:29.700 --> 45:30.540
 This is really exciting.

45:30.540 --> 45:31.460
 They're supposed to ship it to me.

45:31.460 --> 45:32.340
 Where is it?

45:32.340 --> 45:33.880
 Okay, but anyway, that's really cool.

45:33.880 --> 45:35.100
 I didn't know it was Snapdragon.

45:35.100 --> 45:39.720
 Yeah, we're working with robotics in industrial.

45:39.720 --> 45:41.300
 Of course, drones.

45:41.300 --> 45:44.900
 We're getting more and more traction for robotics.

45:44.900 --> 45:45.740
 Sorry to interrupt.

45:45.740 --> 45:47.260
 Industrial robotics, too, you said?

45:47.260 --> 45:50.380
 Industrial, especially when you think about

45:51.940 --> 45:55.760
 what's gonna happen with the factory of the future,

45:55.760 --> 45:57.060
 the industrial side of the future,

45:57.060 --> 45:58.200
 the warehouse of the future,

45:58.200 --> 46:01.520
 when you bring 5G, for example, to it,

46:01.520 --> 46:04.540
 and you have a number of different use cases,

46:04.540 --> 46:09.120
 and then you see a lot of robotics application.

46:09.120 --> 46:11.820
 And of course, drones.

46:11.820 --> 46:16.500
 And the most famous, I will consider that a robot,

46:16.500 --> 46:19.960
 the most famous robot in the world right now,

46:19.960 --> 46:21.300
 it's powered by Snapdragon,

46:21.300 --> 46:24.500
 which is the Mars Ingenuity helicopter.

46:24.500 --> 46:27.360
 The whole helicopter, the cameras and everything,

46:27.360 --> 46:28.780
 it's powered by Snapdragon.

46:28.780 --> 46:32.780
 And talking about exciting thing for an engineer,

46:32.780 --> 46:35.140
 the same Snapdragon that goes to a phone,

46:35.140 --> 46:37.740
 and it can go to a Galaxy phone, for example, Samsung,

46:37.740 --> 46:41.380
 the same, not a special one, went all the way to Mars.

46:42.260 --> 46:45.020
 Is exploring other planets, looking for alien life,

46:45.020 --> 46:46.120
 and maybe gets to meet them.

46:46.120 --> 46:47.100
 Wouldn't that be interesting,

46:47.100 --> 46:49.720
 if a Snapdragon is the thing that first sees an alien?

46:49.720 --> 46:50.640
 It's like, what the hell?

46:50.640 --> 46:52.340
 We did not program this in the computer vision.

46:52.340 --> 46:53.980
 I once used the example to go back

46:53.980 --> 46:57.140
 to the conversation we had about quality.

46:57.140 --> 46:59.580
 As an engineer, you need to make sure it works.

46:59.580 --> 47:01.260
 Can you imagine if it gets over there on Mars

47:01.260 --> 47:02.100
 and it doesn't work?

47:02.100 --> 47:04.060
 Listen, this is very stressful.

47:04.060 --> 47:07.020
 What NASA, what SpaceX, what all those companies are doing

47:07.020 --> 47:08.100
 is extremely stressful.

47:08.100 --> 47:10.580
 The room for mistakes is tiny.

47:10.580 --> 47:13.280
 But that's super exciting for an engineer, once again.

47:14.920 --> 47:17.340
 There's been a global semiconductor chip shortage.

47:17.340 --> 47:19.720
 So from your perspective, just it'd be interesting

47:19.720 --> 47:23.380
 to get your expert analysis of the situation.

47:23.380 --> 47:24.780
 What do you think are the main reasons

47:24.780 --> 47:28.580
 and how has Qualcomm been affected and how can it help?

47:28.580 --> 47:31.380
 In this, in the future, things like it.

47:31.380 --> 47:36.380
 Okay, that's a big topic of conversation.

47:36.380 --> 47:38.060
 And we only have five minutes.

47:38.060 --> 47:41.880
 So I'll try to be as objective as I can.

47:41.880 --> 47:43.780
 So first, let's talk about what caused it.

47:43.780 --> 47:46.460
 And you hear a lot of different things.

47:46.460 --> 47:48.820
 I will try to put it within the right context.

47:48.820 --> 47:51.320
 The first thing that caused it, really,

47:51.320 --> 47:54.900
 is the acceleration of digital transformation

47:54.900 --> 47:59.180
 of pretty much everything in every industry.

47:59.180 --> 48:01.340
 Every industry has been digitally transformed.

48:01.340 --> 48:04.940
 And as such, the amount of semiconductors

48:04.940 --> 48:07.420
 that are required is much larger.

48:07.420 --> 48:09.020
 Just to give you a practical example,

48:09.020 --> 48:11.660
 if you think about the automotive as an example,

48:11.660 --> 48:15.100
 the cars that are, there's cars that are launched,

48:15.100 --> 48:17.180
 a new model launching today.

48:17.180 --> 48:20.700
 The new model launching today most likely has 10X

48:20.700 --> 48:23.940
 the amount of chips of the prior model.

48:23.940 --> 48:25.700
 And the model that people are working on

48:25.700 --> 48:28.460
 that's coming in next, probably 10X that one.

48:28.460 --> 48:30.140
 So you see the amount of silicon

48:30.140 --> 48:32.580
 and then billions of things become smart.

48:32.580 --> 48:34.420
 More and more data goes to the cloud.

48:34.420 --> 48:35.820
 The data center grows.

48:35.820 --> 48:40.500
 So the floor for semiconductor consumptions went up by a lot.

48:40.500 --> 48:43.180
 Then you have things that aggravated this.

48:43.180 --> 48:45.100
 The pandemic aggravated this.

48:45.100 --> 48:47.820
 There is a couple of trends from the pandemic.

48:47.820 --> 48:50.100
 The enterprise transformation of the home.

48:50.100 --> 48:51.540
 The home became an enterprise.

48:51.540 --> 48:56.540
 Massive amounts of upgrades on broadband and IoT.

48:57.540 --> 49:02.700
 The office has changed to the way we work now,

49:02.700 --> 49:05.300
 including the ability to support collaboration tools

49:05.300 --> 49:06.780
 and video.

49:06.780 --> 49:11.780
 Then you have the higher demand for products

49:14.140 --> 49:17.700
 during the pandemic because people wanted to be connected.

49:17.700 --> 49:19.340
 People bought new phones and new tablets

49:19.340 --> 49:22.140
 and new computers, new gaming.

49:22.140 --> 49:24.780
 So all of those things came on top of that

49:24.780 --> 49:28.580
 as the aggravated issue, but they're not the main issue.

49:28.580 --> 49:33.580
 The main issue is it's actually a long term growth

49:34.020 --> 49:35.180
 of digital.

49:35.180 --> 49:38.380
 So what I'm hearing you say is the pandemic

49:38.380 --> 49:40.780
 was not the cause, it was an aggravation.

49:40.780 --> 49:41.620
 It was an aggravation.

49:41.620 --> 49:46.620
 So is there a way we can support as a human civilization

49:48.260 --> 49:51.420
 in terms of manufacture, in terms of supply,

49:51.420 --> 49:53.900
 the kind of growth that you're talking about

49:53.900 --> 49:55.620
 in devices and so on?

49:55.620 --> 49:58.060
 Is there high level ideas you can say

49:58.060 --> 49:59.940
 of what that's required there?

49:59.940 --> 50:02.500
 Yes, and I think that's the second part of the answer.

50:02.500 --> 50:03.860
 So what's happening now?

50:03.860 --> 50:05.540
 How are we gonna get out of this?

50:05.540 --> 50:10.140
 So we see a lot of capacity investments

50:10.140 --> 50:12.900
 put into place by the industry.

50:12.900 --> 50:15.740
 We had invested a lot with our suppliers.

50:15.740 --> 50:19.500
 A lot of the suppliers had made plans

50:19.500 --> 50:22.140
 about increasing the capacity.

50:22.140 --> 50:24.380
 The industry is planning to double

50:24.380 --> 50:27.180
 its total semiconductor manufacturing capacity

50:27.180 --> 50:30.140
 within the next five years, an example.

50:30.140 --> 50:31.460
 So that's already happening.

50:31.460 --> 50:33.900
 And then you see things which are actually good.

50:33.900 --> 50:35.300
 They're good.

50:35.300 --> 50:38.140
 The initiative such as the United States CHIPS Act

50:38.140 --> 50:40.620
 and now the European CHIPS Act.

50:40.620 --> 50:43.700
 The United States CHIPS Act's about $52 billion.

50:43.700 --> 50:45.900
 The European's about 43.

50:45.900 --> 50:49.900
 Their goal combined is to get at least 50%

50:49.900 --> 50:54.340
 of the consumption with manufacturing installed

50:54.340 --> 50:57.260
 within the US and European geographies.

50:57.260 --> 50:58.340
 And that's also very good.

50:58.340 --> 51:03.180
 That's yet another incentive for more manufacturing capacity

51:03.180 --> 51:05.300
 to be built and to be built

51:05.300 --> 51:08.300
 with a geographic distributed way,

51:08.300 --> 51:09.980
 which that's how you plan supply chain.

51:09.980 --> 51:12.420
 So those I think are good things.

51:12.420 --> 51:16.060
 So if anything we learn through the crisis

51:16.060 --> 51:19.420
 is that semiconductor is important.

51:19.420 --> 51:21.380
 Semiconductor companies are important

51:21.380 --> 51:23.860
 and we need to invest in semiconductors.

51:23.860 --> 51:26.140
 We're turning to the grilling of the CEO

51:26.140 --> 51:28.140
 with the hard questions.

51:28.140 --> 51:30.580
 This is almost from my own education of the space.

51:30.580 --> 51:32.220
 You mentioned regulators.

51:32.220 --> 51:34.300
 Qualcomm paid out and received payment

51:34.300 --> 51:37.020
 of billions of dollars in settlement and fines.

51:38.060 --> 51:40.620
 There seems to be a lot of huge lawsuits in this space.

51:40.620 --> 51:42.260
 How do you explain that?

51:42.260 --> 51:45.260
 Does this get in the way of innovation

51:45.260 --> 51:46.860
 or does it promote it?

51:46.860 --> 51:50.620
 I will rephrase it by saying there used to be a lot

51:50.620 --> 51:51.940
 of lawsuits in this space.

51:51.940 --> 51:56.940
 In addition of what we do in semiconductors,

51:56.940 --> 52:00.980
 our processors and our modems, the Snapdragon platform,

52:02.780 --> 52:04.660
 we also have a licensing business,

52:04.660 --> 52:08.060
 which has been a part of the company since the beginning.

52:08.060 --> 52:13.060
 As the largest inventors of the essential technology

52:14.020 --> 52:18.340
 in 2G, CDMA, 3G, 4G and 5G,

52:19.620 --> 52:21.820
 and Qualcomm contribute that to the standards.

52:21.820 --> 52:25.740
 So we always had this model that rather than invent

52:25.740 --> 52:27.980
 the technology and be the only one producing the products,

52:27.980 --> 52:30.300
 we license so everyone can produce it.

52:31.940 --> 52:35.060
 And as such, we receive intellectual property

52:35.940 --> 52:38.340
 for the standard essential patents.

52:40.580 --> 52:44.420
 As part of our past dispute with Apple,

52:44.420 --> 52:46.220
 that's behind us now.

52:46.220 --> 52:47.260
 Your friends now.

52:47.260 --> 52:49.620
 They're my customers.

52:49.620 --> 52:54.580
 And as part of that, I think the licensing model

52:54.580 --> 52:58.580
 got tested, I think, in every geography.

52:58.580 --> 53:02.100
 And we succeeded in every single geography

53:02.100 --> 53:06.780
 to validate the pro competitiveness of this model.

53:06.780 --> 53:09.540
 I think the fair, reasonable,

53:09.540 --> 53:12.260
 non discriminatory aspect of this model.

53:12.260 --> 53:16.420
 And I would argue that besides being the most successful

53:16.420 --> 53:19.860
 licensing business to date in the industry,

53:19.860 --> 53:21.980
 probably the one that's been battle tested

53:21.980 --> 53:25.020
 and is most stable because there's not a single

53:25.020 --> 53:29.060
 jurisdiction that we have not had to validate that model.

53:29.060 --> 53:32.180
 So it's part of our past and what it creates

53:32.180 --> 53:34.220
 is probably create a lot of stability

53:34.220 --> 53:35.220
 in our licensing business.

53:35.220 --> 53:38.300
 But having said that, the growth of the company

53:38.300 --> 53:40.260
 is in the semiconductor space.

53:40.260 --> 53:43.300
 And the semiconductor, so licensing is,

53:43.300 --> 53:44.860
 you come up with a pretty good idea,

53:44.860 --> 53:48.100
 you have a bunch of smart people coming up with cool ideas,

53:48.100 --> 53:49.900
 and then once you come up with that idea,

53:49.900 --> 53:52.340
 you sell that idea to others, they get to use it.

53:52.340 --> 53:53.900
 That's essentially what a license.

53:53.900 --> 53:58.060
 The license revenue we have is for the,

53:58.060 --> 54:02.180
 what we call the SCP, standard essential patents,

54:02.180 --> 54:07.180
 that are part of the 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G standards.

54:07.620 --> 54:10.860
 So if you want to build anything with 5G,

54:10.860 --> 54:13.500
 you need to get a license from Qualcomm

54:13.500 --> 54:16.860
 because it uses Qualcomm essential technology

54:16.860 --> 54:17.940
 as part of the standard.

54:17.940 --> 54:19.580
 And a slightly different model,

54:19.580 --> 54:22.100
 or a lot different model with the semiconductor

54:22.100 --> 54:25.820
 is you design, you inject a bunch of fascinating ideas,

54:25.820 --> 54:28.220
 how to build the Snapdragon, and then there's,

54:28.220 --> 54:29.820
 because it's a fabulous company,

54:29.820 --> 54:33.580
 you have somebody build the chip

54:33.580 --> 54:35.460
 and then goes into a phone with the branding

54:35.460 --> 54:36.740
 and all that kind of stuff.

54:36.740 --> 54:40.100
 And that has less kind of players involved,

54:40.100 --> 54:40.940
 it's not a license.

54:40.940 --> 54:42.340
 We sell the product.

54:42.340 --> 54:45.420
 We don't license semiconductor technology,

54:45.420 --> 54:47.660
 we build products and we sell products.

54:49.460 --> 54:51.620
 This is your first year as a CEO.

54:51.620 --> 54:52.940
 Not one year yet.

54:52.940 --> 54:54.060
 Not one year yet.

54:56.100 --> 54:58.300
 Let's hope it'll be in June, it'll be one year.

54:58.300 --> 54:59.140
 Okay.

55:00.100 --> 55:04.060
 This is a company that's involved

55:04.060 --> 55:06.220
 with a lot of fascinating technologies

55:06.220 --> 55:09.540
 and it's touching the lives of billions of people.

55:09.540 --> 55:11.260
 A lot of complicated stuff.

55:11.260 --> 55:13.460
 Like I said, licensing technologies.

55:13.460 --> 55:17.460
 You have to collaborate with manufacturers.

55:17.460 --> 55:20.020
 You have to then work with, however many you said,

55:20.020 --> 55:23.460
 car companies and all these clients and so on.

55:23.460 --> 55:28.460
 And you have to, with tech companies, Apple and so on.

55:29.500 --> 55:30.460
 What's that like?

55:30.460 --> 55:33.060
 What lessons have you learned about leadership

55:33.060 --> 55:35.100
 and maybe about yourself as a human being

55:35.100 --> 55:39.460
 from this first, almost a year, soon to be a year

55:39.460 --> 55:42.060
 as a CEO of this incredible, this complex,

55:42.060 --> 55:43.500
 this large company?

55:43.500 --> 55:44.540
 That's a loaded question.

55:44.540 --> 55:47.820
 Let me answer in reverse order.

55:47.820 --> 55:51.260
 First thing that I learned, and I think it's probably common

55:52.380 --> 55:55.380
 across CEOs, especially in our industry,

55:55.380 --> 55:58.220
 is it will be great if I had more time.

55:59.300 --> 56:01.860
 I think there's, especially because we grow

56:01.860 --> 56:04.180
 in so many areas and there's so many things to learn,

56:04.180 --> 56:08.420
 so many relationships to build, time to spend

56:08.420 --> 56:10.380
 with a number of different technologies.

56:11.700 --> 56:14.100
 But it kind of reflects really the size

56:14.100 --> 56:16.180
 of the opportunity that exists for Qualcomm.

56:16.180 --> 56:19.060
 Qualcomm, it is really growing in a number

56:19.060 --> 56:22.060
 of different directions all at the same time.

56:22.060 --> 56:25.860
 And so it did got busier.

56:25.860 --> 56:29.820
 And part of this is because I'm spending a lot of time

56:29.820 --> 56:32.740
 understanding the new industries we're going in

56:32.740 --> 56:35.620
 and building relationships.

56:35.620 --> 56:37.380
 Second thing, which is a lot to do

56:37.380 --> 56:39.340
 with how I think about things

56:39.340 --> 56:41.580
 and a little bit of my personality.

56:41.580 --> 56:44.460
 At the end of the day, business partnerships

56:44.460 --> 56:46.940
 are really done by people.

56:46.940 --> 56:51.380
 And I think the importance of having trusted relationships

56:51.380 --> 56:54.860
 for the long term is extremely important.

56:54.860 --> 56:57.380
 And I've been dedicated to do that as CEO.

56:57.380 --> 57:01.020
 We're not a company that plays for the short term.

57:01.020 --> 57:01.860
 We don't.

57:01.860 --> 57:03.780
 And when we build new partnerships,

57:03.780 --> 57:05.980
 we expect that to be for decades.

57:05.980 --> 57:09.420
 And so I spend time doing that

57:09.420 --> 57:11.260
 and think that's important for Qualcomm.

57:11.260 --> 57:15.100
 The other part of your question is,

57:15.100 --> 57:18.900
 we do have a lot of opportunities in all different areas.

57:18.900 --> 57:21.540
 What we like, and I've been fortunate enough

57:21.540 --> 57:23.780
 to become CEO at a time,

57:23.780 --> 57:27.180
 that a lot of the trends are pointing to our technology.

57:27.180 --> 57:28.220
 We talk about some of them.

57:28.220 --> 57:31.300
 We talk about merger of physical and digital spaces.

57:31.300 --> 57:33.500
 We talk about the transformation of the automobile.

57:33.500 --> 57:38.500
 We talk about the merge of computing and mobile,

57:38.820 --> 57:40.580
 the enterprise transformation of the home.

57:40.580 --> 57:42.380
 There are many of those trends.

57:42.380 --> 57:46.140
 And those trends create opportunities for Qualcomm

57:46.140 --> 57:50.820
 to be providing technology first.

57:50.820 --> 57:53.660
 And as such, we're in a hurry.

57:53.660 --> 57:55.420
 So I'm in a little bit of a hurry

57:55.420 --> 57:57.700
 because I think the opportunity is incredible

57:57.700 --> 58:02.620
 for technology, but having fun and enjoying the job.

58:02.620 --> 58:04.780
 Is there a burden because of so much

58:04.780 --> 58:07.300
 of what you said is partnerships

58:07.300 --> 58:09.820
 and almost like friendships,

58:09.820 --> 58:12.300
 connections with other human beings?

58:12.300 --> 58:15.620
 Me as an introvert that has a lot of social anxiety,

58:15.620 --> 58:17.180
 that seems extremely stressful.

58:17.180 --> 58:19.340
 So is there that burden on your shoulders?

58:19.340 --> 58:21.180
 You have to wake up every day

58:21.180 --> 58:25.940
 and talk to friends you've had for many years.

58:25.940 --> 58:28.660
 It can be, and then convince them

58:28.660 --> 58:31.060
 and make partnerships with them,

58:31.060 --> 58:33.700
 talk with them, describe to them the future,

58:33.700 --> 58:36.100
 sell them an idea, and then yourself grow

58:36.100 --> 58:37.360
 because you don't know what the heck

58:37.360 --> 58:38.500
 the future is gonna be like.

58:38.500 --> 58:41.000
 And you have to project both confidence and humility,

58:41.000 --> 58:42.220
 all those kinds of things.

58:42.220 --> 58:43.240
 Is that exhausting?

58:45.100 --> 58:48.680
 It is exhausting, but it's something I do like to do.

58:48.680 --> 58:50.540
 And it's not only with partners, really.

58:50.540 --> 58:54.100
 It's also internally to your employees, I think,

58:54.100 --> 58:55.440
 to get alignment on the vision

58:55.440 --> 58:57.680
 and faith in the vision and execute.

58:57.680 --> 58:59.100
 And at the end of the day, we're very fortunate.

58:59.100 --> 59:00.200
 We have a lot of smart people.

59:00.200 --> 59:02.100
 So people, if they're aligned with the vision,

59:02.100 --> 59:03.460
 they know what to do.

59:03.460 --> 59:05.300
 And then, of course, as CEO,

59:05.300 --> 59:06.860
 you have to convince your investors

59:06.860 --> 59:09.060
 that that's the right idea as well.

59:09.940 --> 59:13.980
 If you can put on your wise sage hat,

59:13.980 --> 59:16.100
 do you have a device for young people

59:16.100 --> 59:18.540
 in high school and college?

59:18.540 --> 59:23.300
 You yourself started from the humble beginnings in Brazil,

59:24.780 --> 59:28.860
 maybe a bit of a wild, risky decision to go to Japan,

59:28.860 --> 59:30.820
 and now are the head of one of the biggest,

59:30.820 --> 59:34.100
 most successful, most impactful companies in the world.

59:34.100 --> 59:37.980
 Given that story, can you give advice to young people today

59:37.980 --> 59:41.180
 that they can have a career

59:41.180 --> 59:43.020
 or just a life they can be proud of?

59:43.980 --> 59:45.420
 I think the first thing,

59:45.420 --> 59:47.740
 and of course, all of those answers

59:47.740 --> 59:52.140
 are gonna relate to my own experience, right?

59:52.140 --> 59:56.940
 The first thing is it always worked for me

59:56.940 --> 1:00:00.980
 to have a plan, even if the plan

1:00:00.980 --> 1:00:02.760
 is just what I'm gonna do in the next two years,

1:00:02.760 --> 1:00:04.260
 but what do I want to do?

1:00:04.260 --> 1:00:05.960
 Where do I wanna go?

1:00:05.960 --> 1:00:08.480
 And I think it's important for people,

1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:09.780
 especially young people,

1:00:10.780 --> 1:00:15.140
 is to really have a dream and go pursue it.

1:00:15.140 --> 1:00:17.560
 I mean, have a dream does not go back to bed to sleep.

1:00:17.560 --> 1:00:20.720
 It's really what do you want to accomplish

1:00:20.720 --> 1:00:22.300
 and then what it's gonna take to do that.

1:00:22.300 --> 1:00:24.200
 And then believe in yourself.

1:00:24.200 --> 1:00:27.600
 Like I said, I joined Qualcomm as an engineer

1:00:28.440 --> 1:00:33.140
 and I didn't have any plans when I joined to be CEO,

1:00:33.140 --> 1:00:34.680
 but I do want, as an engineer,

1:00:34.680 --> 1:00:38.240
 what I wanted to do, where I wanna contribute,

1:00:38.240 --> 1:00:39.320
 what I wanted to work on,

1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:43.800
 and then keep evolving from that point in time.

1:00:43.800 --> 1:00:46.200
 The other thing is, this is an advice,

1:00:46.200 --> 1:00:51.200
 it's more of like career advice that I got early in my career

1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:54.020
 was extremely helpful for me

1:00:54.020 --> 1:00:55.160
 and I will give that advice

1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:56.760
 to everyone that is interested.

1:00:58.740 --> 1:01:02.540
 Spend time understanding what are the things you're good at

1:01:02.540 --> 1:01:04.280
 and what are the things you're not.

1:01:04.280 --> 1:01:08.680
 Like what is the real border between your area of competence

1:01:08.680 --> 1:01:10.580
 and your area of incompetence?

1:01:10.580 --> 1:01:12.320
 And once you see that,

1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:15.680
 once you see that you know exactly what you have to work on

1:01:15.680 --> 1:01:18.880
 and you can say, that's where I wanna go next,

1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:21.160
 this is the gap, I need to do it.

1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:24.760
 And it's faster when you can identify yourself

1:01:24.760 --> 1:01:27.240
 before other people can tell you.

1:01:27.240 --> 1:01:31.480
 Then it leads to automatically the next step.

1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:34.080
 Surround yourself, the people that are very good

1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:35.480
 at the things that you're not.

1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:38.780
 So you have to be radically honest

1:01:38.780 --> 1:01:41.120
 about the things that you're not good at,

1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:42.960
 but given what you're passionate about,

1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:44.160
 you need to get good at,

1:01:44.160 --> 1:01:45.720
 or you would like to get good at,

1:01:45.720 --> 1:01:47.680
 and surround yourself by those people.

1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:50.640
 How often did the plans you make actually work out?

1:01:50.640 --> 1:01:52.520
 So you said it's important to make plans.

1:01:52.520 --> 1:01:54.480
 You didn't say anything about

1:01:54.480 --> 1:01:56.240
 it's important to execute on those plans.

1:01:56.240 --> 1:01:58.600
 More than 50% success rate.

1:01:58.600 --> 1:01:59.960
 Try to keep it above 50.

1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:01.840
 Try to keep it above 50.

1:02:01.840 --> 1:02:05.440
 What was the whole, why did you end up in Japan?

1:02:05.440 --> 1:02:09.560
 I've been fortunate enough to work in cellular and wireless

1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:10.720
 my entire career.

1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:13.880
 So I always liked communications.

1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:15.680
 When I entered engineering school,

1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:17.320
 my dad was electrical engineer,

1:02:17.320 --> 1:02:19.120
 but he worked with the utility company.

1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:21.480
 He wanted me to graduate

1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:23.040
 in traditional electrical engineering,

1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:26.020
 like energy generation, distribution.

1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:29.520
 But I like electronics communication,

1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:31.720
 so I ended up doing both.

1:02:31.720 --> 1:02:35.280
 And I always liked communication.

1:02:35.280 --> 1:02:37.160
 I was fascinated by wireless communication.

1:02:37.160 --> 1:02:38.680
 So my first job at a college,

1:02:38.680 --> 1:02:42.000
 I started working for a Japanese company down in Brazil,

1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.240
 was NEC, and within about a year in,

1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:46.560
 they transferred me to Tokyo.

1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:48.060
 They asked me to go to their headquarters,

1:02:48.060 --> 1:02:51.440
 and it was the first time I left Brazil.

1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:53.400
 A little bit different from Brazil.

1:02:53.400 --> 1:02:54.920
 Culturally. Very different.

1:02:54.920 --> 1:02:57.120
 It is in the other side of the planet.

1:02:58.080 --> 1:03:00.540
 And that's how I started.

1:03:00.540 --> 1:03:02.840
 You said your father's an electrical engineer.

1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:07.580
 Do you think what you're doing now makes your father proud?

1:03:07.580 --> 1:03:08.680
 I think he's very proud.

1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:11.420
 I think especially, you know,

1:03:12.580 --> 1:03:15.760
 he tells me that I'm still the same person

1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:17.480
 that never changed.

1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:19.160
 Does he give you advice?

1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:20.720
 Does he criticize what you're doing?

1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:22.360
 Tell you how to improve?

1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:24.080
 My mom and dad still give me advice today.

1:03:24.080 --> 1:03:25.280
 I'm very fortunate for that.

1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:29.560
 But he's proud.

1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:32.240
 I'm also proud because there are very few Brazilians

1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:36.320
 that have achieved a position as CEO

1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:39.360
 of a company the size of Qualcomm.

1:03:39.360 --> 1:03:43.260
 And I do know that also I carry a burden,

1:03:43.260 --> 1:03:47.720
 especially for the Latino community,

1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:49.220
 to be an inspiration for them

1:03:49.220 --> 1:03:51.940
 and make sure I set a good example.

1:03:51.940 --> 1:03:54.380
 So not just your mom and dad,

1:03:54.380 --> 1:03:59.380
 but the culture, the people that were originally your home.

1:04:01.540 --> 1:04:03.860
 Do you, you know, life is finite.

1:04:04.780 --> 1:04:06.680
 Do you think about your own mortality?

1:04:07.860 --> 1:04:10.980
 Look, I'm a devout Christian,

1:04:10.980 --> 1:04:14.580
 and so I'm a big believer that there's,

1:04:15.460 --> 1:04:16.920
 this is just a transition.

1:04:18.700 --> 1:04:22.140
 But don't spend a lot of time thinking about that.

1:04:22.140 --> 1:04:25.820
 I am somebody good, better, and different

1:04:25.820 --> 1:04:29.340
 that try as much as possible to leave the present,

1:04:29.340 --> 1:04:30.380
 and that's what I do.

1:04:31.660 --> 1:04:33.240
 And try to make the present better

1:04:33.240 --> 1:04:35.860
 on this place here on Earth.

1:04:35.860 --> 1:04:36.700
 Absolutely.

1:04:36.700 --> 1:04:38.060
 And that some of these technologies,

1:04:38.060 --> 1:04:40.980
 some of these ideas are kind of a different kind

1:04:40.980 --> 1:04:42.540
 of immortality as well,

1:04:42.540 --> 1:04:44.500
 because they propagate through time

1:04:44.500 --> 1:04:47.700
 and have impact on people in the best possible way.

1:04:47.700 --> 1:04:49.880
 So technology can be scary,

1:04:49.880 --> 1:04:51.280
 technology can be destructive,

1:04:51.280 --> 1:04:56.280
 but it seems like in the end it can do a lot of good.

1:04:56.460 --> 1:04:59.300
 More good, there's more good than bad.

1:04:59.300 --> 1:05:01.100
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

1:05:01.100 --> 1:05:03.620
 I asked you about aliens observing us.

1:05:03.620 --> 1:05:05.640
 What's the meaning of life?

1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:09.640
 Cristiano, what's the meaning of life?

1:05:09.640 --> 1:05:10.920
 Easy questions.

1:05:10.920 --> 1:05:13.120
 That's not an easy question at all.

1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:15.240
 I think that's a question,

1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:17.640
 at least for me, you have to answer individually.

1:05:18.720 --> 1:05:21.860
 But I do believe we're all here for a purpose.

1:05:24.440 --> 1:05:28.960
 In my prayers I always ask that I stay on track

1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:30.960
 to whatever my purpose is,

1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:33.160
 but I do believe we're here for a purpose,

1:05:33.160 --> 1:05:34.840
 and we need to do the best we can

1:05:34.840 --> 1:05:36.920
 during the time we have on this Earth.

1:05:36.920 --> 1:05:41.040
 So that means create beautiful things for you

1:05:41.040 --> 1:05:42.000
 as an engineer?

1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.640
 Yes, and create beautiful things, yes.

1:05:44.640 --> 1:05:46.280
 What about love?

1:05:46.280 --> 1:05:48.780
 What's the role of love in the human condition?

1:05:49.960 --> 1:05:50.960
 Love's very important,

1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:54.740
 and it's an essential part of being human.

1:05:54.740 --> 1:05:56.880
 It comes in the package.

1:05:56.880 --> 1:06:00.100
 And I think if you look at the situation,

1:06:00.100 --> 1:06:01.480
 what's happening right now,

1:06:01.480 --> 1:06:03.680
 I think if you look at the situation

1:06:03.680 --> 1:06:06.280
 with some of the underprivileged communities,

1:06:06.280 --> 1:06:08.180
 you look at the homeless situation,

1:06:08.180 --> 1:06:10.200
 I think we all need more love.

1:06:10.200 --> 1:06:12.680
 Yeah, and I think people that build incredible technology

1:06:12.680 --> 1:06:14.880
 sometimes forget the love part.

1:06:14.880 --> 1:06:17.280
 Those are all, it's all integrated.

1:06:17.280 --> 1:06:21.720
 There's no, thinking about humanity is really important

1:06:21.720 --> 1:06:24.980
 when you build tools that empower that humanity.

1:06:24.980 --> 1:06:27.360
 Because there's, I think, at least I personally believe

1:06:27.360 --> 1:06:30.200
 we're all capable of both evil and good.

1:06:30.200 --> 1:06:33.400
 And we have to build technology, build societies,

1:06:33.400 --> 1:06:35.200
 build governments, build communities

1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:40.000
 that inspire us to connect with the good part

1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:40.940
 within all of us.

1:06:40.940 --> 1:06:43.760
 I'm a big believer that technology is, at the end,

1:06:43.760 --> 1:06:44.720
 the force for good.

1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:47.560
 And if you just look, you know,

1:06:47.560 --> 1:06:50.880
 not trying to move away from a deep discussion

1:06:50.880 --> 1:06:54.180
 to a more specific, technical one.

1:06:54.180 --> 1:06:58.640
 But we started a conversation talking about smartphones.

1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:03.240
 And smartphones really, the first time

1:07:03.240 --> 1:07:05.240
 that you could say that everybody in the world

1:07:05.240 --> 1:07:06.960
 was able to connect to the internet

1:07:06.960 --> 1:07:07.880
 and connect to each other.

1:07:07.880 --> 1:07:11.400
 And I think what that empowerment that that provided,

1:07:11.400 --> 1:07:13.240
 it's an incredible force for good.

1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:18.660
 Well, the company you lead, the technology you've created,

1:07:18.660 --> 1:07:21.120
 one of them that I'm especially excited about,

1:07:21.120 --> 1:07:23.840
 which is Snapdragon, the whole line of processors there.

1:07:23.840 --> 1:07:27.600
 Currently, I would say at about 10 billion transistors.

1:07:27.600 --> 1:07:29.200
 If you think about the human brain,

1:07:29.200 --> 1:07:31.560
 it's about 100 billion neurons.

1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:36.440
 So I think 11 Samsung Galaxy S22s

1:07:36.440 --> 1:07:37.720
 are already smarter than me.

1:07:37.720 --> 1:07:41.040
 And that's being nice to me.

1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:42.240
 I'm really honored that you spent

1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:44.680
 your extremely valuable time with me,

1:07:44.680 --> 1:07:47.120
 even though you said Pele is the favorite player.

1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:51.360
 Beyond all of that, I think you're an incredible person,

1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:53.240
 incredible leader, and you lead

1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:54.860
 an incredible engineering company.

1:07:54.860 --> 1:07:55.980
 So thank you for doing that.

1:07:55.980 --> 1:07:56.820
 Oh, thank you so much.

1:07:56.820 --> 1:07:58.020
 Thanks for the kind words.

1:07:58.020 --> 1:07:59.920
 Really a pleasure having this conversation.

1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:01.340
 I really had a lot of fun doing it.

1:08:01.340 --> 1:08:03.900
 And thank you for having me in your podcast.

1:08:04.800 --> 1:08:06.280
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

1:08:06.280 --> 1:08:07.960
 with Christiano Aman.

1:08:07.960 --> 1:08:09.640

1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:13.920
 And now, let me leave you with some words

1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:15.100
 from Stephen Hawking.

1:08:15.960 --> 1:08:20.420
 For millions of years, mankind lived just like the animals.

1:08:20.420 --> 1:08:22.480
 Then something happened, which unleashed

1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:24.760
 the power of our imagination.

1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:28.120
 We learned to talk, and we learned to listen.

1:08:28.120 --> 1:08:31.360
 Speech has allowed the communication of ideas,

1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:33.440
 enabling human beings to work together

1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:35.400
 to build the impossible.

1:08:35.400 --> 1:08:40.080
 Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by talking,

1:08:40.080 --> 1:08:43.080
 and its greatest failures by not talking.

1:08:44.160 --> 1:08:46.040
 It doesn't have to be like this.

1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:49.280
 Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future.

1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:51.280
 With the technology at our disposal,

1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:54.200
 the possibilities are unbounded.

1:08:54.200 --> 1:08:58.440
 All we need to do is make sure we keep talking.

1:08:58.440 --> 1:09:25.440
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
