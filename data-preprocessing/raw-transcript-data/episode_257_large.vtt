00:00.000 --> 00:02.520
 The following is a conversation with Brian Keating,

00:02.520 --> 00:05.160
 experimental physicist at USCSD

00:05.160 --> 00:07.760
 and author of Losing the Nobel Prize

00:07.760 --> 00:10.280
 and Into the Impossible.

00:10.280 --> 00:13.680
 Plus, he's a host of the amazing podcast of the same name

00:13.680 --> 00:16.880
 called Into the Impossible.

00:16.880 --> 00:18.880
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:18.880 --> 00:21.020
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:21.020 --> 00:22.160
 in the description.

00:22.160 --> 00:25.980
 And now, here's my conversation with Brian Keating.

00:27.320 --> 00:29.560
 As an experimental physicist,

00:29.560 --> 00:31.360
 what do you think is the most amazing

00:31.360 --> 00:34.660
 or maybe the coolest measurement device

00:34.660 --> 00:37.880
 you've ever worked with or humans have ever built?

00:37.880 --> 00:41.560
 Maybe for now, let's exclude the background imaging

00:41.560 --> 00:45.240
 of cosmic extragalactic polarization instruments.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.320
 Yeah, I'm slightly biased

00:46.320 --> 00:48.000
 towards that particular instrument.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.640
 Talk about that in a little bit.

00:49.640 --> 00:51.560
 But certainly the telescope, to me,

00:51.560 --> 00:55.800
 is a lever that has literally moved the Earth

00:55.800 --> 00:56.720
 throughout history.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.000
 So the OG telescope?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.060
 The OG telescope, yeah.

00:59.060 --> 01:02.040
 The one invented not by Galileo, as most people think,

01:02.040 --> 01:05.900
 but by this guy Hans Lippershey in the Netherlands.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.680
 And it was kind of interesting

01:07.680 --> 01:12.400
 because in the 1600s, 14, 1500, 1600s,

01:12.400 --> 01:14.400
 there was the beginning of movable type.

01:14.400 --> 01:17.200
 And so people, for the first time in history,

01:17.200 --> 01:21.040
 had a standard by which they could appraise their eyesight.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.480
 So looking at a printed word now,

01:22.480 --> 01:24.920
 we just take it for granted, 12 point font, whatever,

01:24.920 --> 01:26.400
 and that's what the eye charts are based on.

01:26.400 --> 01:27.240
 They're just fixed height.

01:27.240 --> 01:30.240
 But back then, there was no way to adjust your eyesight

01:30.240 --> 01:32.720
 if you didn't have perfect vision.

01:32.720 --> 01:35.040
 And there was no way to even tell if you had perfect vision

01:35.040 --> 01:39.000
 or not until the Gutenberg Bible and movable type.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.360
 And at that time, people realized,

01:40.360 --> 01:41.680
 hey, wait, I can't read this.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.800
 My priest or my friend over here, he can read it,

01:43.800 --> 01:44.680
 she can read it.

01:44.680 --> 01:45.520
 I can't read it.

01:45.520 --> 01:46.420
 What's going on?

01:46.420 --> 01:50.680
 And that's when these people in Venice and in the Netherlands

01:50.680 --> 01:53.320
 saw that they could take this kind of glass material

01:53.320 --> 01:55.200
 and hold it up and maybe put another piece

01:55.200 --> 01:57.560
 of glass material and it would make it clearer.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.560
 And what was so interesting is that nobody thought

01:59.560 --> 02:02.640
 to take that exact same device, two lenses,

02:02.640 --> 02:04.680
 and go like, hmm, let me go like this

02:04.680 --> 02:07.180
 and look at that bright thing in the sky over there,

02:07.180 --> 02:08.440
 until Galileo.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.180
 So Galileo didn't invent it,

02:10.180 --> 02:12.480
 but he did something kind of amazing.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.800
 He improved on it by a factor of 10.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.040
 So he 10X'd it, which is almost as good

02:17.040 --> 02:20.340
 as going from zero to one, as going from one to 10.

02:20.340 --> 02:24.880
 And when he did that, he really transformed

02:24.880 --> 02:28.480
 both how we look at the universe and think about it,

02:28.480 --> 02:30.600
 but also who we are as a species,

02:30.600 --> 02:34.240
 because we're using tools not to get food faster

02:34.240 --> 02:39.240
 or to preserve our legacy for future generations,

02:39.800 --> 02:43.700
 but actually to increase the benefit to the human mind.

02:43.700 --> 02:46.540
 Somebody mentioned this idea that if humans

02:46.540 --> 02:47.720
 weren't able to see the stars,

02:47.720 --> 02:52.000
 maybe there was some kind of makeup of the atmosphere,

02:52.000 --> 02:54.640
 which for the early humans made it impossible

02:54.640 --> 02:56.960
 to see the stars, that we would never develop

02:56.960 --> 02:59.400
 human civilization, or at least raising the question

02:59.400 --> 03:02.120
 of how important is it to look up to the sky

03:02.120 --> 03:04.660
 and wonder what's out there, as opposed to,

03:05.680 --> 03:07.960
 maybe this is an over romanticized notion,

03:07.960 --> 03:09.680
 but like looking at the ground,

03:09.680 --> 03:12.760
 it feels like a little bit too much focused on survival,

03:12.760 --> 03:15.360
 not being eaten by a bear slash lion.

03:15.360 --> 03:17.360
 If you look up to the stars, you start to wonder

03:17.360 --> 03:18.680
 what is my place in the universe?

03:18.680 --> 03:21.640
 You think that's modern humans romanticizing?

03:21.640 --> 03:25.720
 It's a little romantic, because they also took the same.

03:25.720 --> 03:28.040
 They took the same two lenses and they looked inward.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.280
 They looked at bacteria, they looked at hairs,

03:30.280 --> 03:32.280
 and in other words, they made the microscope,

03:32.280 --> 03:33.680
 and we're still doing that.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.840
 And so to have a telescope, it serves a dual purpose.

03:37.840 --> 03:41.840
 It's not only a way of looking out, it's looking in,

03:41.840 --> 03:43.440
 but it's also looking back in time.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.680
 In other words, you didn't see a microscope,

03:44.680 --> 03:46.020
 you don't think, oh, I'm seeing this thing

03:46.020 --> 03:47.780
 as it was one nanosecond ago,

03:47.780 --> 03:49.960
 light travels one foot per nanosecond.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.860
 I'm seeing it, no, you don't think about it like that.

03:51.860 --> 03:54.320
 But when you see something that's happening on Jupiter,

03:54.320 --> 03:56.800
 the moon, Andromeda galaxy, you're seeing things

03:56.800 --> 04:00.040
 back when Lucy was walking around the Serengeti Plains.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.360
 And for that, I think that took then the knowledge

04:03.360 --> 04:06.840
 of relativity and time travel and so forth.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.840
 It took that before we could really say,

04:08.840 --> 04:12.200
 oh, we really unlocked some cheat codes in the human brain.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.120
 So I think that might be a little too much,

04:14.120 --> 04:15.800
 but nevertheless, I mean,

04:15.800 --> 04:18.160
 what's better than having a time machine?

04:18.160 --> 04:19.260
 We can look back in time,

04:19.260 --> 04:21.640
 we see things as they were, not as they are.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.200
 And that allows us to do many things,

04:23.200 --> 04:24.680
 including speculate about that.

04:24.680 --> 04:25.740
 But one of the coolest things,

04:25.740 --> 04:26.580
 I don't know if you're familiar with,

04:26.580 --> 04:27.920
 so I'm a radio astronomer.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.280
 I don't actually look through telescopes very often,

04:30.280 --> 04:33.960
 except on rare occasions when I take one out

04:33.960 --> 04:37.800
 to show the kids, but a radio telescope

04:37.800 --> 04:39.800
 is even more sort of visceral.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.240
 I mean, it's much less cool because you look at it,

04:41.240 --> 04:42.240
 you're like, all right, it looks cool,

04:42.240 --> 04:43.760
 it's kind of weird shaped thing,

04:43.760 --> 04:45.040
 looks like it belongs in sci fi,

04:45.040 --> 04:48.120
 it's gonna blast the Death Star or whatever.

04:48.120 --> 04:52.080
 But when you realize that when you point a radio telescope

04:52.080 --> 04:53.560
 at a distant object,

04:53.560 --> 04:55.960
 if that object fills up what's called the beam,

04:55.960 --> 04:59.420
 which is basically the field of view of a radio telescope,

04:59.420 --> 05:00.560
 it's called its beam.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.600
 If you fill up the beam and you put a resistor,

05:03.600 --> 05:05.800
 just a simple absorbing piece of material

05:05.800 --> 05:07.760
 at the focus of the radio telescope,

05:07.760 --> 05:11.200
 that resistor will come to the exact same temperature

05:11.200 --> 05:13.960
 as the object that's looking at, which is pretty amazing.

05:13.960 --> 05:16.160
 It means you're actually remotely measuring,

05:16.160 --> 05:17.960
 you're taking the temperature of Jupiter

05:17.960 --> 05:20.160
 or whatever in effect.

05:20.160 --> 05:23.600
 And so it's allowing you to basically teleport

05:23.600 --> 05:24.880
 and there's no other science

05:24.880 --> 05:26.040
 that you can really do that, right?

05:26.040 --> 05:27.320
 If you're an archeologist, you can't,

05:27.320 --> 05:29.720
 let me get into my time machine

05:29.720 --> 05:32.240
 and go back and see what was Lucy really like,

05:32.240 --> 05:33.080
 it's not possible.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.840
 So the same thing happens,

05:34.840 --> 05:36.240
 this is where I've learned about this

05:36.240 --> 05:37.320
 from March of the Penguins,

05:37.320 --> 05:39.080
 when the penguins huddled together,

05:40.720 --> 05:43.280
 the body temperature arrives to the same place.

05:43.280 --> 05:45.320
 So you're doing this remotely,

05:45.320 --> 05:46.880
 the March of the Penguins, but remote.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.160
 We do it from Antarctica too,

05:48.160 --> 05:50.480
 so there are some penguins around when we do it.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.440
 Okay, excellent.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.480
 You mentioned time machine,

05:53.480 --> 05:57.080
 I think in your book, Losing the Nobel Prize,

05:57.080 --> 05:59.680
 you talk about time machines.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.440
 So let me ask you the question of,

06:03.080 --> 06:04.520
 take us back in time,

06:04.520 --> 06:07.480
 what happened at the beginning of our universe?

06:07.480 --> 06:09.880
 Ah, okay, usually people preface this

06:09.880 --> 06:11.200
 by saying I have a simple question.

06:11.200 --> 06:15.200
 So what happened before the universe began, what happened?

06:15.200 --> 06:17.520
 Brian Keating teaching me about comedy.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.960
 I have a simple question for you, let's take two.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.080
 I have a simple question,

06:22.080 --> 06:23.800
 what happened at the beginning of our universe?

06:23.800 --> 06:24.640
 There you go.

06:24.640 --> 06:25.480
 All right, good.

06:25.480 --> 06:28.160
 So when we think about what happened,

06:28.160 --> 06:30.560
 it's more correct, it's more logical,

06:30.560 --> 06:34.640
 it's more practical to go back in time starting from today.

06:34.640 --> 06:39.640
 So if you go back 13.874 billion years from today,

06:40.480 --> 06:41.640
 that's some day, right?

06:41.640 --> 06:43.360
 I mean, you could translate into some day, right?

06:43.360 --> 06:45.640
 So on that day, something happened.

06:45.640 --> 06:49.120
 Earlier than the moment exactly now,

06:49.120 --> 06:52.160
 let's say we're talking around one o clock.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.480
 So at some point during that day,

06:54.480 --> 06:57.200
 the universe started to become a fusion reactor.

06:57.200 --> 07:00.120
 It started to fuse light elements and isotopes

07:00.120 --> 07:01.680
 into heavier elements and isotopes

07:01.680 --> 07:03.520
 of those heavier elements.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.080
 After that period of time,

07:05.080 --> 07:06.600
 going forward back closer to today,

07:06.600 --> 07:09.680
 less 10 minutes earlier, 10 minutes earlier,

07:09.680 --> 07:11.960
 or later rather coming towards us today,

07:11.960 --> 07:14.400
 we know more and more about what the universe was like.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.520
 And in fact, all the hydrogen,

07:16.520 --> 07:19.080
 it's a very good approximation in the water molecules

07:19.080 --> 07:21.400
 in this bottle, almost all of them were produced

07:21.400 --> 07:23.680
 during that first 20 minute period.

07:23.680 --> 07:27.800
 So I would say, the actual fusion and production

07:27.800 --> 07:30.560
 of the lightest elements on the periodic table

07:30.560 --> 07:33.360
 occurred in a time period shorter than the TV show,

07:33.360 --> 07:34.400
 The Big Bang Theory.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.240
 Well done, sir.

07:35.240 --> 07:39.200
 You know, most of those light elements besides hydrogen

07:39.200 --> 07:41.680
 aren't really used in your encounter, right?

07:41.680 --> 07:43.680
 You don't encounter helium that often,

07:43.680 --> 07:45.320
 unless you go to a lot of birthday parties

07:45.320 --> 07:47.160
 or pilot a blimp.

07:47.160 --> 07:49.360
 You don't need lithium, hopefully, you know,

07:49.360 --> 07:50.240
 but other than that,

07:50.240 --> 07:51.080
 those are the kinds of things

07:51.080 --> 07:52.280
 that were produced during that moment.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.280
 The question became, how did the heavier things

07:54.280 --> 07:56.760
 like iron, carbon, nickel, we can get to that later.

07:56.760 --> 07:59.720
 And I brought some samples for us to discuss

07:59.720 --> 08:02.240
 and how those came from a very different type of process

08:02.240 --> 08:04.600
 called a different type of fusion reactor

08:04.600 --> 08:07.120
 and a different type of process explosion as well

08:07.120 --> 08:08.520
 called a supernova.

08:08.520 --> 08:11.480
 However, if you go back beyond those first three minutes,

08:11.480 --> 08:13.880
 we really have to say almost nothing

08:13.880 --> 08:15.880
 because we are not capable.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.440
 In other words, going backwards

08:17.440 --> 08:18.840
 from the first three minutes,

08:18.840 --> 08:21.840
 as famous Steven Weinberg titled his book,

08:21.840 --> 08:25.160
 we actually marks a point where ignorance takes over.

08:25.160 --> 08:28.280
 In other words, we can't speculate on what happened

08:28.280 --> 08:30.920
 three minutes before the preponderance of hydrogen

08:30.920 --> 08:32.360
 was formed in our universe.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.720
 We just don't know enough about that epoch.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.280
 There are many people, most people,

08:36.280 --> 08:38.800
 most practicing card carrying cosmologists

08:38.800 --> 08:41.400
 believe the universe began in what's called the singularity.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.000
 And we can certainly talk about that.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.480
 However, singularity is so far removed

08:46.480 --> 08:49.160
 from anything we can ever hope to prove,

08:49.160 --> 08:51.960
 hope to confront or hope to observe with evidence.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.920
 And really only occurs in two instantiations,

08:54.920 --> 08:57.000
 the big bang and the core of a black hole,

08:57.000 --> 08:58.640
 neither of which is observable.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.160
 And so for that reason,

09:00.160 --> 09:02.880
 there are now flourishing alternatives that say,

09:02.880 --> 09:05.280
 you can actually for the first time ask the question

09:05.280 --> 09:10.280
 that day, Tuesday in the first moments of our universe,

09:10.280 --> 09:12.800
 there was a Tuesday a week before that,

09:12.800 --> 09:15.040
 24 hours times seven days before that.

09:15.960 --> 09:19.360
 That has a perfectly well understood meaning

09:19.360 --> 09:23.640
 in models of cosmology promoted by some of the more eminent

09:23.640 --> 09:25.440
 of cosmologists working today.

09:25.440 --> 09:28.080
 When I was in grad school over 25 years ago,

09:28.080 --> 09:30.600
 no one really considered anything besides that big bang

09:30.600 --> 09:32.440
 that there was a singularity.

09:32.440 --> 09:36.320
 And people would have to say, as I said, we just don't know.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.760
 But they would say some future incarnation

09:38.760 --> 09:40.800
 of some experiment will tell us the answer.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.880
 But now there are people that are saying

09:42.880 --> 09:45.360
 there is an alternative to the big bang.

09:45.360 --> 09:46.960
 And it's not really fringe science

09:46.960 --> 09:50.880
 as it once was 50, 80 years ago when these models...

09:50.880 --> 09:53.760
 By the way, the first cosmology in history

09:53.760 --> 09:55.720
 was not a singular universe.

09:55.720 --> 09:59.280
 The first cosmology in history goes back to Akhenaten Ra

09:59.280 --> 10:03.720
 and the temples of Egypt in the third millennium BC.

10:03.720 --> 10:06.200
 And in that, they talked about cyclical universes.

10:06.200 --> 10:09.200
 So I always joke, that guy Akhenaten's court,

10:09.200 --> 10:11.560
 he'd have a pretty high H index right about now

10:11.560 --> 10:14.360
 because people have been using that cyclical model

10:14.360 --> 10:17.760
 from Penrose to Paul Steinhardt and Aegis

10:17.760 --> 10:20.880
 and right up until this very moment.

10:20.880 --> 10:25.120
 Can you maybe explore the possible alternatives

10:25.120 --> 10:27.400
 to the big bang theory?

10:27.400 --> 10:29.880
 So there are many alternatives starting with...

10:29.880 --> 10:33.640
 So the singularity quantum cosmologically demanding

10:33.640 --> 10:37.560
 singular origin of the universe, that stands in contrast

10:37.560 --> 10:40.160
 to these other models in which time does not have

10:40.160 --> 10:44.040
 a beginning and many of them feature cycles,

10:44.040 --> 10:47.600
 at least one cycle, possibly infinite number of cycles,

10:47.600 --> 10:48.880
 called by Sir Roger Penrose.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.920
 And they all have things in common, these alternatives,

10:51.920 --> 10:55.080
 as does the dominant paradigm of cosmogenesis,

10:55.080 --> 10:56.200
 which is inflation.

10:56.200 --> 11:00.120
 Inflation can be thought of as this spark

11:00.120 --> 11:03.000
 that ignites the hot big bang that I said we understood.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.600
 So it's an earlier condition,

11:04.600 --> 11:06.560
 but it's still not an initial condition.

11:06.560 --> 11:09.640
 In physics, imagine I show you a grandfather clock

11:09.640 --> 11:11.440
 or a pendulum swinging back and forth.

11:11.440 --> 11:14.360
 You look away for a second, you come into the room,

11:14.360 --> 11:15.440
 pendulum swinging back and forth.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.360
 Alex, tell me, where did it start?

11:17.360 --> 11:19.560
 How many cycles is it gonna make before the era?

11:19.560 --> 11:20.800
 You can't answer that question

11:20.800 --> 11:22.760
 without knowing the initial conditions.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.080
 In a very simple system, like a one dimensional,

11:25.080 --> 11:27.240
 simple harmonic oscillator, like a pendulum,

11:27.240 --> 11:29.160
 think about understanding the whole universe

11:29.160 --> 11:31.320
 without understanding the initial conditions.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.920
 It's a tremendous lacuna, a gap that we have as scientists

11:34.920 --> 11:39.280
 that we may not be able to, in the inflationary cosmology,

11:39.280 --> 11:42.040
 determine the quantitative physical properties

11:42.040 --> 11:43.800
 of the universe prior to what's called

11:43.800 --> 11:45.120
 the inflationary epoch.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.520
 So you're saying for the pendulum in that epoch,

11:47.520 --> 11:50.960
 we can't, because you can infer things about the pendulum

11:50.960 --> 11:54.320
 before you show up to the room in our current epoch,

11:54.320 --> 11:55.160
 correct? Right.

11:55.160 --> 11:56.680
 Yeah, so if you look at it right now,

11:56.680 --> 11:58.560
 but if I said, well, when will it stop oscillating?

11:58.560 --> 12:00.920
 So that depends on how much energy it got initially.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.000
 And you can measure its dissipation, its air resistance,

12:03.000 --> 12:03.840
 you had infrared camera,

12:03.840 --> 12:05.400
 you could see it's getting hotter maybe,

12:05.400 --> 12:07.120
 and you could do some calculations.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.200
 But to know the two things in physics

12:09.200 --> 12:10.840
 to solve a partial differential equation

12:10.840 --> 12:12.920
 are the initial conditions and the boundary conditions.

12:12.920 --> 12:14.000
 Boundary conditions, we're here on earth,

12:14.000 --> 12:16.320
 it has gravitational field, it's not gonna excurs,

12:16.320 --> 12:19.320
 or make excursions wildly beyond the length of the pendulum.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.960
 It's not, it has simple properties.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.200
 So, but this is like, in other words,

12:25.200 --> 12:28.680
 you can't tell me when did the solar system start orbiting

12:28.680 --> 12:29.960
 in the way that it does now.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.400
 In other words, when did the moon acquire

12:31.400 --> 12:33.560
 the exact angular momentum that it has now?

12:34.720 --> 12:36.320
 Now, that's a pretty pedestrian example.

12:36.320 --> 12:40.040
 But what I'm telling you is that the inflationary epoch

12:40.040 --> 12:43.080
 purports and is successful at providing

12:43.080 --> 12:46.200
 a lot of explanations for how the universe evolved

12:46.200 --> 12:48.520
 after inflation took place and ended,

12:48.520 --> 12:52.040
 but it says nothing about how it itself took place.

12:52.040 --> 12:53.680
 And that's really what you're asking me.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.240
 I mean, you don't really, look,

12:55.240 --> 12:57.800
 what you care about like big bang nucleosynthesis

12:57.800 --> 13:00.120
 and the elements got made and these fusion reactors

13:00.120 --> 13:02.040
 and the whole universe was a fusion reactor,

13:02.040 --> 13:04.760
 but like, don't you really care about what happened

13:04.760 --> 13:08.440
 at the beginning of time, at the first moment of time?

13:08.440 --> 13:11.160
 And the problem is we can't really answer that

13:11.160 --> 13:12.960
 in the context of the big bang.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.760
 We can answer that in the context of these alternatives.

13:15.760 --> 13:16.960
 So you asked me about some of the alternatives.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.120
 So one is Aon theory,

13:18.120 --> 13:21.040
 the conformal cyclic cosmology of Sir Roger Penrose.

13:21.040 --> 13:25.320
 Another one that was really popular in the 60s and 70s

13:25.320 --> 13:28.080
 until the discovery of the primary component

13:28.080 --> 13:29.000
 of my research field,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.360
 the cosmic microwave background radiation or CMB,

13:31.360 --> 13:33.200
 the three Kelvin all pervasive signal

13:33.200 --> 13:36.360
 that astronomers detected in 1965.

13:36.360 --> 13:39.240
 That kind of spelled the death knell in some sense

13:39.240 --> 13:42.160
 to what was called the quasi steady state universe.

13:43.560 --> 13:47.640
 And then there was another model

13:47.640 --> 13:49.200
 that kind of came out of that.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.720
 You hear the word quasi, so it's not steady state.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.200
 Steady state means always existed.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.680
 That was a cosmology Einstein believed until Hubble

13:55.680 --> 13:58.960
 showed him evidence for the expansion of the universe.

13:58.960 --> 14:02.480
 And most scientists believed in that for millennia basically.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.560
 The universe was eternal, static, unchanging.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.040
 They couldn't believe that after Hubble.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.480
 So they had to append onto it,

14:09.480 --> 14:12.920
 concatenate this new feature that it wasn't steady,

14:12.920 --> 14:14.400
 it was quasi steady.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.840
 So the universe was making a certain amount of hydrogen

14:16.840 --> 14:19.640
 every century in a given volume of space.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.880
 And that amount of hydrogen that was produced was constant.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.080
 But because it was producing more and more every century,

14:25.080 --> 14:27.000
 as centuries pile up and the volume piles up,

14:27.000 --> 14:28.320
 the universe could expand.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.760
 And so that's how they developed it.

14:29.760 --> 14:30.600
 That's slowly.

14:30.600 --> 14:31.440
 Very slowly.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.440
 And it doesn't match observational evidence.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.160
 But that is an alternative.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.200
 By the way, did Einstein think

14:36.200 --> 14:39.360
 the steady state universe is infinite or finite?

14:39.360 --> 14:40.200
 Do you know?

14:41.320 --> 14:43.440
 I would assume that he thought it was infinite

14:43.440 --> 14:45.320
 because there was really,

14:45.320 --> 14:48.240
 if something had a no beginning in time,

14:48.240 --> 14:50.680
 then it would be very unlikely we're in the center of it

14:50.680 --> 14:54.000
 or it's bounded or it has, in that case, a finite edge to it.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
 I wonder what he thought about infinity

14:56.000 --> 14:57.280
 because that's such an uncomfortable.

14:57.280 --> 14:58.520
 Yeah, it's a silly joke.

14:58.520 --> 15:00.720
 I'm sure you're familiar with this silly joke, right?

15:00.720 --> 15:02.880
 The silly joke was that there are only two things

15:02.880 --> 15:06.600
 that are infinite, the universe and human stupidity,

15:06.600 --> 15:08.560
 and I'm not sure about the universe.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.880
 Well, me saying I'm not aware of the joke

15:10.880 --> 15:12.800
 is a good example of the joke.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.080
 It's very meta.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.520
 Okay, so, all right, sorry.

15:16.520 --> 15:17.840
 You were saying about quasi.

15:17.840 --> 15:18.680
 All the alternatives.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.920
 All the alternatives in the quasi steady state.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.800
 And the most kind of promising,

15:22.800 --> 15:24.320
 although I hate to say that,

15:24.320 --> 15:27.120
 people say, well, that's your favorite alternative, right?

15:27.120 --> 15:29.480
 This is not investment advice.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.880
 Inflation is not transitory.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.480
 It is quasi permanent.

15:34.440 --> 15:35.760
 So, a very prominent.

15:35.760 --> 15:36.600
 Sorry to interrupt.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.200
 We're talking about cosmic inflation,

15:38.200 --> 15:40.280
 so calm down, cryptocurrency folks.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.120
 That's right.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.080
 Although the first Nobel Prize,

15:43.080 --> 15:45.160
 and one of the first Nobel Prizes in economics

15:45.160 --> 15:48.360
 was awarded for inflation, not of the cosmological kind.

15:48.360 --> 15:49.200
 So, most people don't know

15:49.200 --> 15:50.520
 that inflation has already won a Nobel Prize.

15:50.520 --> 15:53.120
 It's a good topic to work on if you won a Nobel Prize.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.080
 Doesn't matter the field.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.320
 Exactly, it's time translation invariant.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.920
 So, when we look at the alternative

15:59.920 --> 16:03.080
 that's called the bouncing or cyclic cosmologies,

16:03.080 --> 16:07.840
 these have serious virtues, according to some.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.040
 One of the virtues to me, just as a human,

16:10.040 --> 16:11.960
 I'm just speaking as a human,

16:12.880 --> 16:15.640
 one of the founders of the new version

16:15.640 --> 16:20.640
 of the cyclic cosmology called the bouncing cosmology

16:21.320 --> 16:22.520
 is Paul Steinhardt.

16:22.520 --> 16:24.760
 He's the Einstein Professor of Natural Sciences

16:24.760 --> 16:25.760
 at Princeton University.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.000
 You may have heard of it.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.560
 And he was one of the originators

16:29.560 --> 16:32.280
 of what was called new inflation.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.400
 In other words, he was one of the founding fathers

16:34.400 --> 16:38.560
 of inflation, who now not only has no belief

16:38.560 --> 16:40.000
 or support for inflation,

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
 he actively claims that inflation is baroque, pernicious,

16:45.000 --> 16:48.040
 dangerous, malevolent, not to science,

16:48.040 --> 16:50.840
 not just to cosmology, but to society.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.320
 So, here's a man who created a theory

16:53.320 --> 16:56.200
 that's captivated the world or universe of cosmologists,

16:56.200 --> 16:57.040
 such as it is.

16:57.040 --> 16:57.920
 It's not a huge universe,

16:57.920 --> 17:00.840
 but there are more podcasters than cosmologists.

17:00.840 --> 17:01.680
 Some do both.

17:01.680 --> 17:06.680
 But this man created this theory with collaborators.

17:06.760 --> 17:10.520
 And now he's like, I'm like, Paul, you're denying paternity.

17:10.520 --> 17:11.960
 You're like a deadbeat dad.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.960
 Now you're saying like, inflation is bogus.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.360
 But he doesn't just attack.

17:17.360 --> 17:18.680
 See, this is what's very important

17:18.680 --> 17:21.560
 about approaching things as an experimentalist.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.560
 You got a lot of theorists on, and that's wonderful.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.200
 And I think that's a huge service.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.800
 An experimentalist has to say no.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.440
 He or she has to be confident to say like,

17:30.440 --> 17:32.840
 I don't care if I prove you right

17:32.840 --> 17:35.320
 or I prove your enemy wrong or whatever.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.120
 We have to be like exterminators.

17:37.120 --> 17:38.640
 And nobody likes the exterminator

17:38.640 --> 17:39.560
 until they need one, right?

17:39.560 --> 17:41.400
 Or the garbage collectors, right?

17:41.400 --> 17:45.760
 But it's vital that we be completely kind of unpersuaded

17:45.760 --> 17:48.840
 by the beauty and the magnificence and the symmetry

17:48.840 --> 17:50.120
 and the simplicity of some idea.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.440
 Like inflation is a beautiful idea,

17:52.440 --> 17:54.000
 but it also has consequences.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
 And what Paul claims,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.320
 I don't agree with him fully on this point,

17:57.320 --> 17:59.160
 is that those consequences are dangerous

17:59.160 --> 18:01.400
 because they lead to things like the multiverse,

18:01.400 --> 18:03.720
 which is outside the purview of science.

18:03.720 --> 18:07.240
 And in that sense, I can see support for what he does,

18:07.240 --> 18:09.840
 but none of that detracts from my respect for a man.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.800
 You know, imagine like, you know,

18:11.800 --> 18:14.440
 Elon comes up with this like really great idea,

18:14.440 --> 18:15.520
 you know, space, and then he's like,

18:15.520 --> 18:18.160
 oh, actually it's not gonna work.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.400
 But like, here's this better idea.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.040
 And he's like, SpaceX is not gonna work,

18:21.040 --> 18:23.280
 but he's now creating an alternative to it.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.920
 It's extremely hard to do what Paul has done.

18:25.920 --> 18:27.080
 Doesn't mean he's right.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.240
 Doesn't mean I'm gonna like have more

18:29.240 --> 18:32.000
 and more attention paid to it because he's my friend

18:32.000 --> 18:33.360
 or because I respect the idea

18:33.360 --> 18:35.960
 or I respect the man and his colleague,

18:35.960 --> 18:38.440
 Anna Aegis, who works really hard with him.

18:38.440 --> 18:41.560
 But nevertheless, this has certain attractions to it.

18:41.560 --> 18:45.640
 And what it does most foremost is that it removes

18:45.640 --> 18:49.280
 the quantum gravity aspect from cosmology.

18:49.280 --> 18:52.160
 So it takes away 50% of the motivation

18:52.160 --> 18:54.320
 for a theory of quantum gravity.

18:54.320 --> 18:56.600
 You've talked a lot about quantum gravity.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.880
 You talk to people, eminent people on the show.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.960
 Always latent in those conversations

19:00.960 --> 19:03.640
 is sort of the teleological expectation

19:03.640 --> 19:06.160
 that there is a theory of everything.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.760
 There is a theory of quantum gravity.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.560
 But there's no law that says

19:10.560 --> 19:12.800
 we have to have a theory of quantum gravity.

19:12.800 --> 19:16.280
 So that kind of implicit expectation

19:16.280 --> 19:19.480
 has to do ultimately with the inflationary theory.

19:19.480 --> 19:23.360
 So in cosmic inflation, so is that at the core?

19:23.360 --> 19:28.000
 So okay, maybe you can speak to what is the negative impacts

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
 on society from believing in cosmic inflation.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.280
 So one of the more kind of robust predictions of inflation,

19:37.280 --> 19:39.720
 according to its other two patriarchs,

19:39.720 --> 19:41.800
 considered to be its patriarchs, Alan Guth at MIT

19:41.800 --> 19:44.080
 and Andrei Linde at Stanford,

19:44.080 --> 19:48.080
 although he was in the USSR when he came up with these ideas,

19:48.080 --> 19:51.200
 along with Paul Steinhardt, was that the universe

19:51.200 --> 19:55.160
 has to eventually get into a quantum state,

19:55.160 --> 19:57.040
 has to exist in this Hilbert space,

19:57.040 --> 19:58.840
 and the Hilbert space has certain features,

19:58.840 --> 20:00.320
 and those features are quantum mechanical,

20:00.320 --> 20:02.920
 endowed with quantum mechanical properties.

20:02.920 --> 20:07.400
 And then it becomes very difficult to turn inflation off.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.120
 So inflation can get started,

20:09.120 --> 20:11.960
 but then it's like one of, you know, SpaceX rockets.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.400
 It's hard to turn off a solid rocket booster, right?

20:14.400 --> 20:16.240
 It continues the thrusting.

20:16.240 --> 20:19.040
 You need another mechanism to douse the flames

20:19.040 --> 20:21.240
 of the inflationary expansion,

20:21.240 --> 20:24.200
 which means that if inflation kicks off somewhere,

20:24.200 --> 20:27.640
 it will kick off potentially everywhere at all times,

20:27.640 --> 20:32.440
 including now, spawning an ever increasing set of universes.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.920
 Some will die stillborn, some will continue and flourish,

20:35.920 --> 20:38.800
 and this is known as the multiverse paradigm.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.000
 It's a robust, seemingly robust consequence,

20:41.000 --> 20:43.480
 not only of inflationary cosmology,

20:43.480 --> 20:44.560
 but more and more, we're seeing it

20:44.560 --> 20:45.560
 in string theory as well.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.200
 So that, you know, sometimes two, you know,

20:48.200 --> 20:49.600
 branches coming to the same conclusion

20:49.600 --> 20:52.320
 is, you know, taken as evidence for its reality.

20:52.320 --> 20:54.240
 So one of the negative consequences

20:54.240 --> 20:57.600
 is it creates phenomena that we can't,

20:57.600 --> 21:01.680
 that are outside the reach of experimental science,

21:01.680 --> 21:04.120
 or is it that the multiverse somehow

21:04.120 --> 21:07.520
 has a philosophical negative effect on humanity?

21:07.520 --> 21:08.760
 Like it makes us,

21:10.880 --> 21:13.200
 maybe it makes life seem more meaningless?

21:13.200 --> 21:15.960
 Is that where he's getting at a little bit,

21:15.960 --> 21:18.080
 or is it not reaching that far?

21:18.080 --> 21:20.920
 Well, no, I think those are both kind of perceptive.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.000
 The answer is a little of both,

21:23.000 --> 21:26.600
 because in one sense, it's meant kind of to explain

21:26.600 --> 21:28.160
 this fine tuning problem,

21:28.160 --> 21:29.880
 that we find ourselves in a universe

21:29.880 --> 21:32.720
 that's particularly facund, that has features,

21:32.720 --> 21:34.800
 you know, consistent with our existence,

21:34.800 --> 21:36.240
 and how could we be otherwise?

21:36.240 --> 21:39.000
 You know, this sort of weak anthropic principle.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.520
 On the other hand, a theory that predicts everything,

21:42.520 --> 21:46.000
 literally everything, can be said to predict nothing.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.320
 Like if I say, Lex, you know, you've been working out,

21:48.320 --> 21:50.360
 you look like, you know, yeah, you haven't,

21:50.360 --> 21:51.200
 yeah, that's great.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.160
 You look like you're, you know,

21:52.160 --> 21:54.840
 about somewhere under 10,000 kilograms.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.520
 Like, all right, yeah, you're right,

21:56.520 --> 21:57.840
 but that's horribly imprecise.

21:57.840 --> 21:58.960
 So what good is that?

21:58.960 --> 21:59.780
 That's meaningless.

21:59.780 --> 22:01.640
 You don't contribute any what's called surprise,

22:01.640 --> 22:03.160
 or reduction in entropy,

22:03.160 --> 22:06.160
 or reduction of your ignorance about the system,

22:06.160 --> 22:08.360
 or you know exactly how much you weigh.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.300
 So me telling you that tells you nothing.

22:10.300 --> 22:11.920
 In this case, it's basically saying

22:11.920 --> 22:13.220
 that we're living in a universe

22:13.220 --> 22:16.200
 because the overwhelming odds of our existence

22:17.160 --> 22:18.960
 dictate that we would exist.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.720
 There has to be at least one place that we exist.

22:20.720 --> 22:24.120
 But the problem is it's a manifestation of infinity.

22:24.120 --> 22:26.640
 So humans, and I'm sure you know this

22:26.640 --> 22:29.980
 from your work with AI and ML and everything else,

22:30.880 --> 22:33.600
 that humans, as far as we know,

22:33.600 --> 22:36.160
 really are the only entities capable

22:36.160 --> 22:38.360
 of contemplating infinity,

22:38.360 --> 22:40.680
 but we do so very imperfectly, right?

22:40.680 --> 22:42.320
 So if I say to you, like, what's bigger,

22:42.320 --> 22:45.220
 the number of, you know, water molecules in this thing,

22:45.220 --> 22:46.760
 or the number of real numbers?

22:46.760 --> 22:47.580
 Or if I say, what's bigger,

22:47.580 --> 22:49.280
 the number of real numbers or rational numbers?

22:49.280 --> 22:50.800
 They're all different classifications

22:50.800 --> 22:53.240
 of the amount of infinities that there could be.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.600
 Infinity to the infinity power.

22:54.600 --> 22:55.500
 You know, when you have kids someday,

22:55.500 --> 22:56.960
 they'll tell you, I love you, infinity.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.400
 You have to come back, I love you, infinity plus one, right?

22:59.400 --> 23:03.360
 So, but the human brain can't really contemplate infinity.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.160
 Let me illustrate that.

23:05.160 --> 23:06.840
 They say in the singularity,

23:06.840 --> 23:10.720
 the universe had an infinite temperature, right?

23:10.720 --> 23:12.480
 So let me ask you a question.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.480
 Is there anything that you can contemplate

23:14.480 --> 23:17.680
 in the, you know, Einstein's little quip aside,

23:17.680 --> 23:20.200
 that's infinite, like a physical property,

23:20.200 --> 23:24.880
 density, pressure, temperature, energy, that's infinite.

23:24.880 --> 23:27.520
 And if you can think of such thing, I'd like to know it.

23:27.520 --> 23:30.600
 But if you can, how does it go to infinity minus one?

23:30.600 --> 23:32.920
 You know, the opposite direction I go with my kids.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.560
 How does it go from like to half of infinity?

23:34.560 --> 23:35.700
 Because that's still infinity.

23:35.700 --> 23:36.920
 How did it cool down?

23:36.920 --> 23:39.460
 How did it get more and more tenuous and rarefied?

23:39.460 --> 23:41.600
 So now it's only infinity over two,

23:41.600 --> 23:42.440
 in terms of pascals.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.600
 Less infinite to more infinite.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.400
 Yeah, I mean, it's,

23:46.400 --> 23:49.680
 that's one of the biggest troubling things to me

23:49.680 --> 23:53.800
 about infinity is you can't truly hold it inside our minds.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.800
 It's a mathematical construct that doesn't,

23:55.800 --> 23:57.840
 it feels like intuition fails.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.960
 But nevertheless, we use it nonchalantly

23:59.960 --> 24:02.720
 and then use, like physicists,

24:02.720 --> 24:05.440
 they're incredible intuition machines.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.960
 And then they'll play with this infinity

24:06.960 --> 24:10.300
 as if they can play with it on the level of intuition

24:10.300 --> 24:12.320
 as opposed to on the level of math.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.100
 You know, yeah, maybe it's something cyclical

24:14.100 --> 24:15.320
 you can imagine in infinity,

24:15.320 --> 24:17.400
 just going around the same,

24:18.580 --> 24:20.540
 kind of like a Mobius strip situation.

24:20.540 --> 24:23.780
 But then the question then arises,

24:23.780 --> 24:26.500
 how do you make it more or less infinite?

24:26.500 --> 24:28.940
 Yeah, all of that intuition fails completely.

24:28.940 --> 24:31.320
 And I mean, how do you represent it in a computer, right?

24:31.320 --> 24:33.400
 It's either some placeholder for infinity

24:33.400 --> 24:34.780
 or it's one divided by a very,

24:34.780 --> 24:38.260
 the smallest possible real number

24:38.260 --> 24:39.700
 that you can represent in the memory.

24:39.700 --> 24:42.500
 Well, that's basically my undergraduate study

24:42.500 --> 24:44.260
 in computer science is how to represent

24:44.260 --> 24:45.860
 a floating point in a computer.

24:45.860 --> 24:47.940
 I think I took 17 courses on this topic.

24:47.940 --> 24:49.060
 It was very useful.

24:49.060 --> 24:49.980
 I came to the right place.

24:49.980 --> 24:53.580
 But in terms of what a physicist will mean,

24:53.580 --> 24:55.700
 and you're right, I mean, physicists will blithely,

24:55.700 --> 24:58.900
 nonchalantly subtract infinity, renormalization,

24:58.900 --> 25:01.220
 and do things to get finite answers.

25:01.220 --> 25:03.020
 And it's miraculous.

25:03.020 --> 25:05.460
 But at a certain point, you have to ask,

25:05.460 --> 25:07.420
 well, what are the consequences for the real world?

25:07.420 --> 25:10.260
 So one of them, you ask, what's the problem?

25:10.260 --> 25:11.800
 Does it make us more meaningless?

25:11.800 --> 25:14.060
 They purport, many of the people that support it,

25:14.060 --> 25:15.260
 like Andrei Linde.

25:15.260 --> 25:18.100
 In fact, Andrei Linde says, you have a bias.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.780
 You, Lex, me, Brian.

25:19.780 --> 25:22.980
 You have a bias that you believe in a universe.

25:22.980 --> 25:25.980
 But shouldn't you believe in a multiverse?

25:25.980 --> 25:28.620
 What evidence do you have that there's not a multiverse?

25:28.620 --> 25:30.100
 So he turns it around.

25:30.100 --> 25:33.500
 Whereas Paul Steinhardt will say, no, if anything can happen,

25:33.500 --> 25:35.940
 then there's no predictive power within the theory.

25:35.940 --> 25:37.300
 Because you can always say, well,

25:37.300 --> 25:39.140
 this value of the inflationary field

25:39.140 --> 25:43.500
 did not produce sufficient gravitational wave energy

25:43.500 --> 25:45.700
 for us to detect it with BICEP or Simon's Observatory

25:45.700 --> 25:46.420
 or whatever.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.540
 But that doesn't mean that inflation didn't happen.

25:48.540 --> 25:50.700
 It's logically 100% correct.

25:50.700 --> 25:55.580
 But it's like kind of chewing Wonder Bread.

25:55.580 --> 25:59.100
 Apologize if they're one of your sponsors, but you know.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.740
 Wonderbread slash lex.com.

26:01.740 --> 26:03.620
 Type in code Klebb, right?

26:03.620 --> 26:04.300
 Klebb.

26:04.300 --> 26:06.020
 That's my favorite Russian word is like,

26:06.020 --> 26:07.660
 would you like a piece of Klebb?

26:07.660 --> 26:10.940
 By the way, even that word, Klebb,

26:10.940 --> 26:13.660
 which means bread in Russian, as you say it,

26:13.660 --> 26:15.920
 like you're jokingly saying it now,

26:15.920 --> 26:17.500
 it made me hungry because it made

26:17.500 --> 26:19.340
 me remember how much I loved bread

26:19.340 --> 26:20.660
 when I was in the Soviet Union.

26:20.660 --> 26:24.380
 When you were hungry, that was the things you dreamed about.

26:24.380 --> 26:24.940
 I don't know.

26:24.940 --> 26:28.380
 You know, what's amazing is how many of the Soviet scientists

26:28.380 --> 26:31.860
 contributed to so much of what we understand today.

26:31.860 --> 26:33.360
 And they were completely in hiding.

26:33.360 --> 26:34.220
 There was no Google.

26:34.220 --> 26:35.660
 They couldn't look up on Scholar.

26:35.660 --> 26:36.280
 They had nothing.

26:36.280 --> 26:37.820
 They had to wait for journals to get

26:37.820 --> 26:40.580
 approved by the Communist Party to get approved.

26:40.580 --> 26:43.060
 And only then, if they weren't a member of some class,

26:43.060 --> 26:44.940
 I'm sure you know, like Jewish scientists,

26:44.940 --> 26:48.260
 you had a passport that said Jew on your passport.

26:48.260 --> 26:52.700
 And Zeldovich, the famous Yakov Borisovich Zeldovich,

26:52.700 --> 26:56.300
 he was the advisor, one of my advisors, Alexander Polnareff.

26:56.300 --> 27:00.460
 And he had to, only because he was like at a Nobel level

27:00.460 --> 27:03.660
 and was one of the fathers of the Soviet atomic bomb program,

27:03.660 --> 27:06.900
 could he even get his Jewish student, he was Jewish too,

27:06.900 --> 27:09.420
 but only by virtue of his standing

27:09.420 --> 27:11.100
 of his intellectual accomplishments,

27:11.100 --> 27:12.740
 would they give him the dispensation

27:12.740 --> 27:16.100
 to let his student travel to Georgia or something.

27:16.100 --> 27:17.860
 And it makes what we complain about,

27:17.860 --> 27:19.460
 and I complain about academia.

27:19.460 --> 27:21.980
 And it's like, oh, well, what can I talk about?

27:21.980 --> 27:24.140
 We have no idea of how good it is

27:24.140 --> 27:26.620
 and that they were able to create things like inflation,

27:26.620 --> 27:28.100
 completely isolated from the West.

27:28.100 --> 27:29.540
 I mean, some of these people didn't

27:29.540 --> 27:33.300
 meet people like Stephen Hawking until he was almost dead.

27:33.300 --> 27:36.900
 And they just learned this thing through smuggled in.

27:36.900 --> 27:39.300
 It's a work of heroism, especially in cosmology.

27:39.300 --> 27:41.780
 There's so many cosmologists that worked incredibly hard,

27:41.780 --> 27:43.380
 probably because they were working the,

27:43.380 --> 27:45.500
 they could pass off as, well, we're doing stuff

27:45.500 --> 27:47.980
 for the atomic bomb program as well, which they were.

27:47.980 --> 27:52.300
 At the same time, there is interesting incentives

27:52.300 --> 27:54.060
 in the Soviet system that,

27:54.060 --> 27:57.780
 maybe we can take this tangent for a brief moment,

27:57.780 --> 28:01.700
 that because there's a dictatorship, authoritarian regime

28:01.700 --> 28:03.780
 throughout the history of the 20th century

28:03.780 --> 28:07.780
 for the Soviet Union, science was prioritized.

28:07.780 --> 28:10.820
 And because the state prioritized it

28:10.820 --> 28:13.540
 through the propaganda machines and the news and so on,

28:13.540 --> 28:16.180
 it actually was really cool to be a scientist.

28:16.180 --> 28:18.020
 Like you were highly valued in society.

28:18.020 --> 28:19.860
 Maybe that's a better way to say it.

28:19.860 --> 28:23.540
 And I would say, you're saying like, we have it easy now.

28:23.540 --> 28:27.660
 In that sense, it was kind of beneficial

28:27.660 --> 28:29.140
 to be a scientist in that society

28:29.140 --> 28:31.980
 because you were seen as a hero, as there's famous.

28:31.980 --> 28:34.140
 Yes, the most famous hero of the Soviet Republic.

28:34.140 --> 28:37.100
 And that, you know, there's positives to that.

28:37.100 --> 28:40.300
 I mean, I'm not saying I would take the negatives

28:40.300 --> 28:43.780
 or the positives, but it is interesting to see a world

28:43.780 --> 28:46.140
 in which science was highly prized.

28:46.140 --> 28:49.540
 In the capitalist system, or maybe not capitalist,

28:49.540 --> 28:51.580
 let's just say the American system,

28:51.580 --> 28:56.580
 the celebrities are the athletes, the actors and actresses,

28:57.980 --> 29:01.100
 maybe business leaders, musicians.

29:02.380 --> 29:05.620
 And, you know, the people we elect are sort of lawyers

29:05.620 --> 29:10.620
 and lawyers, so it's interesting to think of a world

29:12.300 --> 29:13.940
 where science was highly prized,

29:13.940 --> 29:18.220
 but they had to do that science within the constraints

29:18.220 --> 29:21.020
 of always having big brother watching.

29:21.020 --> 29:22.260
 Yeah, the same in Germany.

29:22.260 --> 29:24.020
 Germany had, you know, highly prized science.

29:24.020 --> 29:26.540
 I mean, one of the most famous tragic to me cases

29:26.540 --> 29:29.780
 is Fritz Haber who invented the Haber Bosch process

29:29.780 --> 29:31.780
 that allowed us to, I don't know, have you eaten yet?

29:31.780 --> 29:34.580
 You look, I mean, I know you fast, intermittent fast

29:34.580 --> 29:36.020
 every day and you do that.

29:36.020 --> 29:38.460
 You know, I said chleb and you got, it's a little drool,

29:38.460 --> 29:41.420
 but he says I'm lifting and I look slim.

29:41.420 --> 29:42.660
 This is amazing.

29:42.660 --> 29:44.540
 I'm gonna clip this out and put it on Tinder.

29:44.540 --> 29:45.420
 I think that's a website.

29:45.420 --> 29:48.380
 You gotta swipe left or right for that, I don't know.

29:48.380 --> 29:51.140
 But when you think about like, you know, what he did

29:51.140 --> 29:53.500
 and created the fertilizer process that we all enjoy

29:53.500 --> 29:58.140
 and we eat from every day, he was a German nationalist,

29:58.140 --> 30:00.100
 first and foremost, even though he was a Jew.

30:00.100 --> 30:02.300
 And he personally went to witness the application

30:02.300 --> 30:05.260
 of ammonia, chlorine gas applied during trench warfare

30:05.260 --> 30:08.540
 in 1916 in battles in Brussels and whatever.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.900
 And he was, they had a whole conjure of Nobel laureates

30:10.900 --> 30:12.780
 in chemistry and physics, you know,

30:12.780 --> 30:14.460
 that would go and witness these atrocities.

30:14.460 --> 30:17.620
 But that was also, they were almost putting science

30:17.620 --> 30:19.780
 above, I don't wanna say human dignity,

30:19.780 --> 30:23.660
 but of like the fact that he would later be suppressed.

30:23.660 --> 30:27.500
 And actually some of his relatives would die in Auschwitz

30:27.500 --> 30:30.020
 because of the chemical that he invented also

30:30.020 --> 30:31.540
 called Zyklon B.

30:31.540 --> 30:33.020
 And so it's just unbelievable.

30:33.020 --> 30:36.100
 So I feel like that does have resonance today

30:36.100 --> 30:38.700
 in this worship of science, you know,

30:38.700 --> 30:41.340
 and listen to science and follow the science,

30:41.340 --> 30:42.900
 which is more like scientism.

30:43.740 --> 30:45.180
 And there is still a danger.

30:45.180 --> 30:47.980
 You know, I always say, just cause you're an atheist

30:47.980 --> 30:49.700
 doesn't mean you don't have a religion.

30:49.700 --> 30:51.620
 You know, just because you, you know,

30:51.620 --> 30:54.700
 in my case, in my books, I talk a lot about the Nobel prize.

30:54.700 --> 30:56.660
 It's kind of like a kosher idol.

30:56.660 --> 30:58.460
 It's something that you can worship, you know,

30:58.460 --> 30:59.460
 it doesn't do any harm.

30:59.460 --> 31:02.420
 And we want those people that are so significant

31:02.420 --> 31:03.740
 in their intellectual accomplishments.

31:03.740 --> 31:06.100
 Cause there is a core of America

31:06.100 --> 31:07.380
 and the Western world in general

31:07.380 --> 31:10.580
 that does worship and really look at science predominantly

31:10.580 --> 31:12.020
 cause it gives us technology,

31:13.220 --> 31:14.860
 but there's something really cool about that.

31:14.860 --> 31:17.380
 And so for me, it's hard to find that balance point

31:17.380 --> 31:20.780
 between looking to science for wisdom,

31:20.780 --> 31:23.580
 which I don't think it has, they're two different words,

31:23.580 --> 31:27.060
 but also recognizing how much good and transformative power

31:27.060 --> 31:30.380
 maybe our only hope comes from science.

31:30.380 --> 31:32.660
 You opened so many doors

31:32.660 --> 31:37.660
 cause you also bring up our Ernest Becker in that book.

31:38.820 --> 31:43.260
 So there's a lot of elements of religiosity to science

31:43.260 --> 31:44.500
 and to the Nobel prize.

31:44.500 --> 31:48.260
 It's fascinating to explore and we will.

31:48.260 --> 31:50.140
 And we still haven't finished the discussion

31:50.140 --> 31:54.100
 of the beginning of the universe, which we'll return to.

31:54.100 --> 31:57.860
 But now since you opened the book, wow,

31:57.860 --> 32:01.420
 pun unintended of losing the Nobel prize,

32:01.420 --> 32:04.420
 can you tell me the story of BICEP,

32:04.420 --> 32:05.660
 the background imaging

32:05.660 --> 32:09.180
 of cosmic extragalactic polarization experiment,

32:09.180 --> 32:11.420
 BICEP one and BICEP two,

32:11.420 --> 32:13.180
 and then maybe you can talk about BICEP three,

32:13.180 --> 32:16.340
 but the thing that you cover in your book,

32:16.340 --> 32:18.740
 the human story of it, what happened?

32:18.740 --> 32:21.700
 Yeah, that book is in contradistinction of the second book.

32:21.700 --> 32:22.740
 That's like a memoir.

32:22.740 --> 32:26.580
 It's really a description of what it's like to feel,

32:26.580 --> 32:28.820
 what it feels like to be a scientist

32:28.820 --> 32:32.180
 and to come up with the ignorance, uncertainty,

32:32.180 --> 32:35.220
 imposter syndrome, which I cover in the later book

32:35.220 --> 32:38.260
 in more detail, but to really feel like

32:38.260 --> 32:41.500
 you're doing something and it's all you think about.

32:41.500 --> 32:43.540
 It is all consuming.

32:43.540 --> 32:45.500
 And it's something I couldn't have done now

32:45.500 --> 32:47.300
 cause I have too many other,

32:47.300 --> 32:50.060
 wonderful, delightful demands of my time.

32:50.060 --> 32:51.660
 But to go back to that moment

32:51.660 --> 32:53.940
 when I was first captivated by the night sky

32:53.940 --> 32:56.100
 who has a 12 year old, 13 year old,

32:56.100 --> 32:59.740
 and really mixed together throughout my scientific story

32:59.740 --> 33:01.740
 has always been wanting to approach

33:01.740 --> 33:02.980
 the greatest mystery of all,

33:02.980 --> 33:05.940
 which I think is the existence or non existence of God.

33:05.940 --> 33:08.900
 So I call myself a practicing agnostic.

33:08.900 --> 33:12.580
 In other words, I do things that religious people do

33:12.580 --> 33:16.060
 and I don't do things that atheist people do.

33:16.060 --> 33:18.020
 And I once had this conversation,

33:18.020 --> 33:19.300
 with my first podcast guest actually,

33:19.300 --> 33:21.500
 I shouldn't say, oh, I was just having a conversation

33:21.500 --> 33:24.180
 with Freeman Dyson, but he was actually my first guest.

33:24.180 --> 33:25.020
 And I miss him.

33:25.020 --> 33:25.840
 Name drop.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.300
 Name drop, yes.

33:27.300 --> 33:30.020
 I'm sure there's gonna be plenty of comments about that.

33:30.020 --> 33:33.260
 In case people don't know, Brian Keating is the host

33:33.260 --> 33:34.860
 of Into the Impossible podcast,

33:34.860 --> 33:38.700
 where he's talked to some of the greatest scientists

33:38.700 --> 33:41.180
 in history of science, physicists,

33:41.180 --> 33:43.300
 especially in the history of science.

33:43.300 --> 33:45.180
 So when I talked to Freeman, I said,

33:45.180 --> 33:47.660
 Freeman, you call yourself an agnostic too.

33:47.660 --> 33:50.060
 Can you tell me something like what do you do on Saturday,

33:50.060 --> 33:51.900
 on Sundays, do you go to church?

33:51.900 --> 33:53.620
 He's like, no, I don't go to church.

33:53.620 --> 33:55.380
 And I'm like, well, imagine there was

33:55.380 --> 33:58.100
 like an intelligent alien and he was looking down

33:58.100 --> 34:01.500
 or she, I don't know, thing was looking down

34:01.500 --> 34:03.420
 and it saw Freeman and on Sundays,

34:03.420 --> 34:05.260
 like a group of people go to church,

34:05.260 --> 34:06.600
 but Freeman doesn't go to church.

34:06.600 --> 34:07.660
 And then there's another group of people

34:07.660 --> 34:10.220
 that don't go to church and those are called atheists,

34:10.220 --> 34:12.180
 but Freeman calls himself an agnostic,

34:12.180 --> 34:14.100
 but he does the things that the Richard Dawkins,

34:14.100 --> 34:15.940
 he doesn't go to the same church

34:15.940 --> 34:18.260
 that Richard Dawkins doesn't go to, right?

34:18.260 --> 34:19.900
 So I said, how would you distinguish yourself

34:19.900 --> 34:20.820
 if not practice?

34:20.820 --> 34:22.180
 So I'm a behaviorist.

34:22.180 --> 34:23.780
 I believe you can change your mentality.

34:23.780 --> 34:26.060
 You can influence your mind,

34:26.060 --> 34:28.460
 view your bodily physical actions.

34:28.460 --> 34:30.500
 So when I was a 12 year old, I got my first telescope.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.580
 I was actually an altar boy in a Catholic church,

34:32.580 --> 34:34.460
 which is kind of strange for a Jewish kid

34:34.460 --> 34:35.280
 who grew up in New York.

34:35.280 --> 34:36.860
 Maybe we'll get into that, maybe not.

34:36.860 --> 34:41.180
 But I was just fascinated by these, these.

34:41.180 --> 34:42.900
 Can we get into it for a second?

34:42.900 --> 34:45.140
 Okay, yeah, all right, let's go.

34:45.140 --> 34:46.580
 All right, let's go there.

34:46.580 --> 34:47.420
 All right.

34:47.420 --> 34:49.660
 Let's go to a baby Brian or young.

34:49.660 --> 34:51.100
 Young Brian.

34:51.100 --> 34:53.100
 The new sitcom on CBS.

34:53.100 --> 34:55.780
 Young Brian, born to two Jewish parents.

34:55.780 --> 34:58.100
 My father was a professor at SUNY Stony Brook.

34:58.100 --> 35:00.460
 He was a mathematician, eminent mathematician.

35:00.460 --> 35:02.140
 And my mother was an eminent mom

35:02.140 --> 35:06.600
 and a brilliant English major, et cetera.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.100
 And they raised it, but they were secular.

35:08.100 --> 35:09.600
 They, you know, we'd go to, I always joke,

35:09.600 --> 35:12.780
 we'd go to synagogue, you know, two times a year,

35:12.780 --> 35:14.100
 on Christmas and Easter.

35:14.100 --> 35:16.700
 No, no, we would go, yeah, Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah,

35:16.700 --> 35:19.460
 right, that's the typical two day a year Jews.

35:19.460 --> 35:21.580
 And you know, we'd have, we'd have matzahs

35:21.580 --> 35:23.320
 once a year on Palm Passover.

35:23.320 --> 35:24.380
 And that was about it.

35:24.380 --> 35:26.380
 And for years, I was like that

35:26.380 --> 35:28.120
 until my parents got divorced.

35:28.120 --> 35:31.100
 My mother remarried and she married an Irish Catholic man

35:31.100 --> 35:32.360
 by the name of Ray Keating.

35:32.360 --> 35:34.380
 My father's name is James X.

35:34.380 --> 35:37.780
 So when she remarried Ray Keating,

35:37.780 --> 35:39.920
 I was immediately adopted.

35:39.920 --> 35:42.380
 I'm actually adopted into the Keating family.

35:42.380 --> 35:44.740
 And he had nine brothers and sisters

35:44.740 --> 35:46.380
 and just warm and gregarious.

35:46.380 --> 35:49.460
 They, you know, did Christmas and Easter.

35:49.460 --> 35:51.460
 It was one of the most wonderful experiences I had.

35:51.460 --> 35:53.980
 And I do things with great gusto.

35:53.980 --> 35:55.900
 Whatever I do, I want to take it all the way.

35:55.900 --> 35:59.320
 So to me, that meant really learning about Christianity,

35:59.320 --> 36:00.300
 in this case, Catholicism.

36:00.300 --> 36:02.300
 So I was baptized, confirmed,

36:02.300 --> 36:04.900
 and I said, I want to go all the way.

36:04.900 --> 36:07.460
 I became an altar boy in the Catholic church.

36:07.460 --> 36:10.460
 And you're going to be the best altar boy there ever was.

36:10.460 --> 36:11.940
 I had like serious skills.

36:11.940 --> 36:13.380
 You passed that collection basket.

36:13.380 --> 36:17.660
 I could push people and get them to 2x their contributions.

36:17.660 --> 36:20.540
 But in this case, I was 13.

36:20.540 --> 36:23.360
 I don't know if you remember when you were 13.

36:23.360 --> 36:25.740
 But if you extrapolate the next level up,

36:25.740 --> 36:28.220
 it's like you go graduate student, postdoc, professor.

36:28.220 --> 36:31.300
 The next level up from confirmation, altar boy,

36:31.300 --> 36:32.240
 is priest.

36:32.240 --> 36:33.860
 And I don't know if you're aware of this,

36:33.860 --> 36:37.540
 but priests are not entitled to have relations with women.

36:37.540 --> 36:40.780
 And as a 13 year old boy, kind of like future casting

36:40.780 --> 36:42.660
 what life's going to be like for myself

36:42.660 --> 36:46.580
 if I continue on my path, I found that maybe I...

36:46.580 --> 36:48.220
 The math is not up.

36:48.220 --> 36:49.140
 That's right.

36:49.140 --> 36:52.580
 There was a serious gap in that future.

36:54.360 --> 36:56.380
 And instead, when I should have been preparing

36:56.380 --> 36:58.660
 for my Bar Mitzvah, as most Jewish boys would be,

36:58.660 --> 37:01.540
 a 12, 13 year old boy, I actually got a telescope

37:01.540 --> 37:04.160
 and became infatuated with all the things

37:04.160 --> 37:05.000
 you could see with it.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.300
 It wasn't bigger than that one over there

37:06.300 --> 37:08.300
 that your hedgehog's looking through.

37:08.300 --> 37:10.040
 Is that a hedgehog?

37:10.040 --> 37:13.100
 It's a hedgehog in the fog.

37:13.100 --> 37:16.380
 I should mention, and we'll go one by one, these things,

37:16.380 --> 37:18.220
 you've given me some incredible gifts.

37:18.220 --> 37:21.660
 Maybe this is a good place to ask about the telescope

37:21.660 --> 37:24.700
 that puts some clamps on and let the hedgehogs look.

37:24.700 --> 37:25.640
 And using...

37:25.640 --> 37:27.820
 Now you're officially an experimental astrophysicist.

37:27.820 --> 37:30.100
 Why experimentalist versus an engineer?

37:30.100 --> 37:31.540
 Because you assembled this telescope,

37:31.540 --> 37:35.220
 you gave it a mount, and you connected it to a very powerful...

37:35.220 --> 37:36.540
 Yeah, but there's no experiment going on.

37:36.540 --> 37:38.340
 It's just engineering for show.

37:38.340 --> 37:39.420
 It's very shallow.

37:39.420 --> 37:41.580
 Experiment is taking it to the next level

37:41.580 --> 37:42.960
 and actually achieving something.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.980
 Here, I just built a thing for show.

37:44.980 --> 37:45.820
 Well, that's always a joke.

37:45.820 --> 37:47.580
 People say, oh, you're an experimental cosmologist.

37:47.580 --> 37:49.860
 I'm like, yeah, I build a lot of universes.

37:49.860 --> 37:52.140
 Actually, most of my time is putting clamps on things,

37:52.140 --> 37:53.140
 soldering things.

37:53.140 --> 37:55.420
 It's not actually doing the stroking

37:55.420 --> 37:57.980
 of my non existent beard, contemplating the cyclic

37:57.980 --> 38:00.220
 versus the bouncing cosmological monitor.

38:00.220 --> 38:04.060
 Just like most of robotics is just using Velcro for things.

38:04.060 --> 38:06.380
 Right, yeah, it's not like having dancing dogs

38:06.380 --> 38:07.580
 and whatever, right?

38:07.580 --> 38:08.420
 So telescope.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.860
 Yes, this telescope.

38:09.860 --> 38:11.340
 What's the story of this little telescope?

38:11.340 --> 38:14.580
 This telescope's a very precious thing in some ways,

38:14.580 --> 38:18.500
 a symbol of what got me into...

38:18.500 --> 38:21.140
 What brought me all the blessings I have in my life

38:21.140 --> 38:22.340
 came from a telescope.

38:22.340 --> 38:26.480
 And I always advise parents or even people for themselves.

38:26.480 --> 38:28.740
 You right here, wherever we are,

38:28.740 --> 38:30.220
 a biggest city on earth, Manhattan,

38:30.220 --> 38:31.700
 where I was growing up as a 12 year old

38:31.700 --> 38:33.380
 outside of Manhattan.

38:33.380 --> 38:35.600
 You can see the exact same craters on the moon,

38:35.600 --> 38:38.780
 the same rings of Saturn, the same moons of Jupiter,

38:38.780 --> 38:40.260
 the same phases of the...

38:40.260 --> 38:42.500
 You can see the Andromeda galaxy,

38:42.500 --> 38:45.700
 Lex, two and a half million light years away from earth.

38:45.700 --> 38:47.700
 You can do that with that little thing over there.

38:47.700 --> 38:48.740
 One that's a little more expensive.

38:48.740 --> 38:51.220
 Get one that has a mount and you could attach now

38:51.220 --> 38:52.260
 your smartphone.

38:52.260 --> 38:53.080
 What the hell is that?

38:53.080 --> 38:55.540
 I wouldn't have known what that was in 1994.

38:55.540 --> 38:58.900
 And with that, you can do something that no other science

38:58.900 --> 39:00.820
 to my knowledge can really replicate,

39:00.820 --> 39:02.360
 maybe biology in some sense,

39:02.360 --> 39:06.700
 but you can experience the physical sensation

39:06.700 --> 39:10.180
 that Galileo experienced when he turned a telescope

39:10.180 --> 39:12.980
 like that to Jupiter and saw these four dots around it.

39:12.980 --> 39:15.540
 Or that Saturn had ears as he called it.

39:15.540 --> 39:18.100
 Or that the moon was not crystalline polished smooth

39:18.100 --> 39:20.520
 and made of this heavenly substance,

39:20.520 --> 39:22.700
 the quintessence substance, right?

39:22.700 --> 39:26.040
 So where else can you be viscerally connected

39:26.040 --> 39:27.680
 with the first person to ever make that discovery?

39:27.680 --> 39:29.540
 Try doing that with the Higgs boson.

39:29.540 --> 39:33.580
 Get yourself an LHC and smash together high luminosity,

39:33.580 --> 39:36.140
 call up Harry Cliffe and say, I want to replicate.

39:36.140 --> 39:36.980
 How did you feel?

39:36.980 --> 39:38.180
 He didn't feel anything.

39:38.180 --> 39:39.240
 None of them felt anything.

39:39.240 --> 39:42.060
 It took years to go, you can't do it.

39:42.060 --> 39:44.420
 But with this, you can feel the exact same emotions.

39:44.420 --> 39:45.420
 That's fascinating.

39:45.420 --> 39:49.180
 It's almost like maybe there's another one like that

39:49.180 --> 39:50.180
 is fire.

39:50.180 --> 39:53.620
 Like when you build a bonfire, can you actually get it?

39:53.620 --> 39:56.860
 See, if you use a lighter, I think if you actually

39:56.860 --> 39:58.900
 by rubbing sticks together or however you do it

39:58.900 --> 40:00.860
 without any of the modern tools,

40:00.860 --> 40:02.340
 that's probably what that's like.

40:02.340 --> 40:04.860
 And then you get to experience the magic of it,

40:04.860 --> 40:07.620
 of what like early humans homo sapiens felt.

40:07.620 --> 40:10.480
 You feel what Aug felt when he did it that first time.

40:10.480 --> 40:11.940
 By the way, is this a gift?

40:11.940 --> 40:13.060
 This is a gift, of course.

40:13.060 --> 40:15.100
 You need a little bit of a swag upgrade,

40:15.100 --> 40:16.180
 so I got you some gifts.

40:16.180 --> 40:18.860
 Yeah, this is a, I'm pulling a Putin,

40:18.860 --> 40:21.180
 like ask if this is a gift,

40:21.180 --> 40:24.280
 making it very uncomfortable for you to say.

40:24.280 --> 40:25.120
 Not really.

40:25.120 --> 40:28.020
 This is actually my childhood telescope here, you know.

40:28.020 --> 40:29.380
 But now I'm keeping it.

40:29.380 --> 40:30.420
 That's right.

40:30.420 --> 40:32.100
 So looking through this telescope.

40:32.100 --> 40:34.660
 Was when your love for science was first born.

40:34.660 --> 40:35.500
 Changed my life.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.300
 Because not only was I doing that,

40:37.300 --> 40:39.380
 I was replicating what Galileo did,

40:39.380 --> 40:42.520
 but I was, and I'm 100% not comparing myself

40:42.520 --> 40:43.660
 to Galileo, Galileo, okay,

40:43.660 --> 40:45.140
 if there's any confusion out there.

40:45.140 --> 40:47.260
 But I did replicate exactly what he did,

40:47.260 --> 40:48.740
 and I was like, holy crap, this is weird.

40:48.740 --> 40:50.180
 Let me write it down.

40:50.180 --> 40:52.500
 So it had another effect, which all good scientists,

40:52.500 --> 40:55.100
 budding scientists should do, and all parents should do,

40:55.100 --> 40:57.040
 get your kid a book, a little notebook,

40:57.040 --> 40:58.480
 tape a pencil to it.

40:58.480 --> 41:00.980
 Write down what you see, what you hypothesize,

41:00.980 --> 41:01.980
 what you think it's gonna be.

41:01.980 --> 41:03.760
 Not like in the high school, you know,

41:03.760 --> 41:06.420
 like hypothesis, thesis, but just like,

41:06.420 --> 41:07.900
 wow, how did I feel?

41:07.900 --> 41:10.180
 Better yet, astronomy is a visual science.

41:10.180 --> 41:11.660
 Sketch what you see.

41:11.660 --> 41:14.820
 The Lagoon Nebula, the Pleiades Seven Sisters.

41:14.820 --> 41:16.900
 You can see them anywhere on Earth.

41:16.900 --> 41:18.380
 And when you do that, again,

41:18.380 --> 41:20.940
 you're connecting two different hemispheres of your brain,

41:20.940 --> 41:22.140
 as I understand it,

41:22.140 --> 41:24.660
 and you're connecting them through your fingertips.

41:24.660 --> 41:27.020
 You literally have the knowledge in your fingertips.

41:27.020 --> 41:30.140
 In your connection between what you see,

41:30.140 --> 41:31.860
 what you observe, and what you write down.

41:31.860 --> 41:34.680
 Then you do research, right?

41:34.680 --> 41:36.380
 The goal of science is not to just replicate

41:36.380 --> 41:38.620
 what other people did, is do something new.

41:38.620 --> 41:40.380
 And that's why we call it research,

41:40.380 --> 41:42.980
 and not just like studying, you know, Wikipedia.

41:42.980 --> 41:45.980
 And in so doing, you start to train a kid

41:45.980 --> 41:48.780
 at age 12 or 13 for 50 bucks.

41:48.780 --> 41:49.620
 It's unbelievable.

41:49.620 --> 41:50.700
 And now we can do even better,

41:50.700 --> 41:53.020
 because you can share it on Instagram or whatever,

41:53.020 --> 41:56.060
 and you can, by doing so, have an entree

41:56.060 --> 41:57.700
 into the world of what does it really mean

41:57.700 --> 41:59.980
 to be a scientist, and do so viscerally.

41:59.980 --> 42:02.620
 You know, I often say, I was taught this

42:02.620 --> 42:05.860
 by my English teacher, Mrs. Tompkins, in ninth grade,

42:05.860 --> 42:09.600
 that the word educate, it doesn't mean to pour into.

42:09.600 --> 42:11.300
 Let me pour in some facts and intellects,

42:11.300 --> 42:12.740
 and you know, it's not like machine learning

42:12.740 --> 42:14.660
 that you're just showing like billions of cats,

42:14.660 --> 42:16.540
 or you know, you're not like forcing it in,

42:16.540 --> 42:17.580
 you're bringing it out.

42:17.580 --> 42:20.220
 It means to pour out of, in Latin, educare.

42:20.220 --> 42:22.840
 And what more could a teacher want

42:22.840 --> 42:25.060
 than to have something, the kid is just like gushing.

42:25.060 --> 42:26.140
 No, you're not gonna see like.

42:26.140 --> 42:26.980
 To inspire the kid.

42:26.980 --> 42:27.820
 Yes.

42:27.820 --> 42:28.640
 Inspire.

42:28.640 --> 42:29.480
 Shout out to Mrs. Tompkins.

42:29.480 --> 42:31.380
 Yeah, Mrs. Tompkins, she's watching, yeah.

42:31.380 --> 42:32.300
 She's a big fan.

42:33.860 --> 42:35.140
 Me, she doesn't care for it, but you.

42:35.140 --> 42:36.080
 Yeah, excellent.

42:36.980 --> 42:38.700
 We take those we love for granted.

42:39.620 --> 42:40.780
 This is in Manhattan.

42:40.780 --> 42:42.340
 This is in Westchester County, New York.

42:42.340 --> 42:43.380
 Okay, got it.

42:43.380 --> 42:47.140
 So okay, but then that's where the dream is born.

42:47.140 --> 42:51.620
 But then there is the pragmatic journey of a scientist.

42:51.620 --> 42:55.180
 So going to university, graduate school,

42:55.180 --> 42:58.280
 postdoc, all the way to where you are today.

42:58.280 --> 43:03.220
 What's that, what are some notable moments in that journey?

43:03.220 --> 43:05.780
 So I call that the academic hunger games.

43:05.780 --> 43:07.740
 Because it's like you're competing against

43:07.740 --> 43:11.500
 like these people who are just getting smarter all the time

43:11.500 --> 43:13.340
 as you're getting smarter all the time.

43:13.340 --> 43:16.380
 They wanna get into a fewer and fewer number of slots.

43:16.380 --> 43:18.340
 Like there's fewer slots to get into college

43:18.340 --> 43:19.420
 than in high school.

43:19.420 --> 43:20.900
 There's fewer slots in graduate school.

43:20.900 --> 43:23.380
 There's fewer, very fewer slots to be a postdoc.

43:23.380 --> 43:26.540
 And many, many, maybe infinitesimal number.

43:26.540 --> 43:29.220
 We just did a faculty search at UC San Diego,

43:29.220 --> 43:31.300
 400 applicants for one position.

43:31.300 --> 43:32.680
 It's almost getting impossible.

43:32.680 --> 43:34.880
 Like I almost can't conceive of doing

43:34.880 --> 43:37.100
 what these new brilliant young people applying

43:37.100 --> 43:39.660
 to become an assistant professor at a state university

43:39.660 --> 43:40.740
 that they're doing.

43:40.740 --> 43:42.940
 It takes so much courage to do that.

43:42.940 --> 43:45.700
 So I went from this kid in New York,

43:45.700 --> 43:48.560
 thinking I would never be a professional astronomer.

43:48.560 --> 43:50.960
 A, because I didn't know any, I'd never seen any.

43:50.960 --> 43:52.580
 I didn't even know that they existed.

43:52.580 --> 43:53.980
 And I thought, who the hell's gonna pay me

43:53.980 --> 43:54.980
 to look at the stars?

43:54.980 --> 43:57.300
 Like, won't they pay me to be like an ice cream taster?

43:57.300 --> 43:59.300
 Like, it's just not something I could conceive

43:59.300 --> 44:00.140
 of getting paid to do.

44:00.140 --> 44:01.620
 Even if I had the brilliance to do it,

44:01.620 --> 44:02.980
 which I didn't feel I did.

44:03.820 --> 44:05.820
 And then I went to graduate school.

44:05.820 --> 44:10.380
 And during graduate school, I had this kind of

44:10.380 --> 44:12.980
 on again, off again relationship with my father.

44:12.980 --> 44:14.500
 And I knew that he was a mathematician.

44:14.500 --> 44:16.460
 He had left and gotten remarried himself

44:16.460 --> 44:17.300
 and moved across the country.

44:17.300 --> 44:19.580
 I didn't see him for 15 years.

44:19.580 --> 44:22.100
 And in that time, I learned a lot about him.

44:22.100 --> 44:23.980
 And I learned that he had gotten very interested

44:23.980 --> 44:25.200
 not in pure mathematics,

44:25.200 --> 44:26.620
 which he had been a number theorist

44:26.620 --> 44:30.340
 and contributed seminal work on the offending equations,

44:30.340 --> 44:33.140
 which play a role in Turing's work that you may have seen.

44:33.140 --> 44:35.620
 But anyway, he had become interested,

44:35.620 --> 44:37.940
 turned completely away from that into the foundations

44:37.940 --> 44:40.100
 of quantum mechanics and relativity, which is physics.

44:40.100 --> 44:42.260
 And by that time I was at Brown University

44:42.260 --> 44:44.940
 and I was thinking, oh, maybe I'll be condensed matter

44:44.940 --> 44:46.620
 physicist or experimentalist.

44:46.620 --> 44:48.820
 I never thought I'd be a theorist and I'm not a theorist.

44:48.820 --> 44:50.660
 So it was pretty prescient.

44:51.900 --> 44:53.340
 But it always appealed to me,

44:53.340 --> 44:56.140
 why not do what made me happy as a 12 year old?

44:56.140 --> 45:00.100
 We often forget about those primitive things about us

45:00.100 --> 45:01.940
 are probably the most sustainable, durable

45:01.940 --> 45:04.220
 and resilient attributes of our character.

45:04.220 --> 45:05.540
 So with my own kids,

45:05.540 --> 45:07.300
 what are they interested in now when they're young?

45:07.300 --> 45:09.020
 And it doesn't mean that's what they're gonna do.

45:09.020 --> 45:10.620
 Some of them wanna play Fortnite,

45:10.620 --> 45:13.060
 like professional Fortnite play, which there are,

45:13.060 --> 45:14.980
 but the odds of that is less

45:14.980 --> 45:16.060
 than the odds of being a professor.

45:16.060 --> 45:19.340
 Can I ask you, is your father still with us?

45:19.340 --> 45:20.180
 No.

45:21.580 --> 45:23.580
 Just in a small tangent.

45:23.580 --> 45:24.500
 Yeah.

45:24.500 --> 45:25.820
 Do you miss him?

45:25.820 --> 45:27.260
 Do you think about him?

45:27.260 --> 45:30.940
 Does his mathematical journey reverberate

45:30.940 --> 45:32.100
 through who you are?

45:32.100 --> 45:33.220
 Oh yeah, absolutely.

45:33.220 --> 45:36.020
 I mean, it did in very many ways

45:36.020 --> 45:37.900
 and he's been gone for a long time now.

45:37.900 --> 45:40.660
 Thinking back to that time with him,

45:40.660 --> 45:43.860
 he must've instilled some capacity for me

45:43.860 --> 45:45.820
 to only wanna spend my time,

45:45.820 --> 45:46.940
 which is a limited quantity.

45:46.940 --> 45:48.380
 I don't think it's the most limited quantity.

45:48.380 --> 45:49.580
 Maybe we'll talk about that later,

45:49.580 --> 45:53.620
 but to go into only the most challenging,

45:53.620 --> 45:56.460
 interesting things with the limited time that we have

45:56.460 --> 45:57.300
 while we're alive.

45:57.300 --> 45:59.740
 And for him, it was the foundations of quantum mechanics.

45:59.740 --> 46:02.700
 For me, it was the foundations of the universe

46:02.700 --> 46:03.740
 and how did it come to be?

46:03.740 --> 46:05.500
 And I felt like, well, people have been trying

46:05.500 --> 46:07.260
 since Einstein to outdo Einstein,

46:07.260 --> 46:08.980
 really have made great progress

46:08.980 --> 46:10.860
 in the foundations of quantum mechanics,

46:10.860 --> 46:12.620
 but this is an exciting time.

46:12.620 --> 46:15.060
 The COBE satellite had just released its data

46:15.060 --> 46:17.500
 that the universe had this anisotropy pattern.

46:17.500 --> 46:20.100
 Stephen Hawking called it like looking at the face of God

46:20.100 --> 46:21.660
 and so forth.

46:21.660 --> 46:23.700
 And so it seemed like this is a good golden age

46:23.700 --> 46:26.380
 for what I'm gonna do and what I'm most interested in.

46:26.380 --> 46:29.220
 But always throughout that, I wanted to understand,

46:29.220 --> 46:30.460
 I didn't wanna be a wrench monkey,

46:30.460 --> 46:33.100
 no offense to people that just do experiment.

46:33.100 --> 46:34.260
 And no offense to monkeys.

46:34.260 --> 46:35.740
 No offense to monkeys, that's right.

46:35.740 --> 46:37.780
 This little guy, sorry, man.

46:37.780 --> 46:40.620
 But thinking back to what animates me,

46:40.620 --> 46:41.980
 it's not doing the engineering

46:41.980 --> 46:44.380
 as much as it is getting the data,

46:44.380 --> 46:45.380
 but there's a lot of steps.

46:45.380 --> 46:48.420
 I wanna be the guy understanding

46:48.420 --> 46:51.980
 what made the universe produce the signal that we saw.

46:51.980 --> 46:54.260
 So I always joke with my theorist friends,

46:54.260 --> 46:56.340
 call me a closeted theorist.

46:56.340 --> 46:58.300
 Like I wanna be, you know what they call

46:58.300 --> 47:01.420
 a guy who hangs out with musicians, a drummer.

47:01.420 --> 47:04.100
 So I wanna be like that for physics,

47:04.100 --> 47:04.980
 for theoretical physics.

47:04.980 --> 47:07.060
 I wanna be like the guy doesn't do new theory,

47:07.060 --> 47:09.260
 but understands the theory that the new theorists are doing.

47:09.260 --> 47:12.580
 I love that formulation of a theorist

47:12.580 --> 47:17.380
 is understanding the source of the signal you're getting.

47:17.380 --> 47:19.060
 Like signal is primary.

47:19.060 --> 47:22.500
 Like the thing you measure is primary

47:22.500 --> 47:26.700
 and theory is just the search of explaining

47:28.260 --> 47:31.860
 how that signal originated, but it's all about the signal.

47:31.860 --> 47:34.260
 I mean, I see the same search for the human mind

47:34.260 --> 47:37.980
 and like neuroscience in that same kind of way.

47:37.980 --> 47:39.900
 It's ultimately about the signal,

47:39.900 --> 47:42.500
 but you kind of hope to understand

47:42.500 --> 47:43.860
 how that signal originated.

47:43.860 --> 47:45.140
 That's fascinating.

47:45.140 --> 47:50.140
 That's such a beautiful way to explain experimental physics

47:52.940 --> 47:54.860
 because it ultimately at the end of the day

47:54.860 --> 47:57.420
 is all about the signal.

47:57.420 --> 47:58.460
 Yeah.

47:58.460 --> 48:00.180
 Yeah, and maybe those two things,

48:00.180 --> 48:02.580
 the neuroscience and the cosmos,

48:02.580 --> 48:04.700
 not getting too romantic, but yeah,

48:04.700 --> 48:07.300
 maybe they're linked in some fundamental way,

48:07.300 --> 48:09.780
 some fundamental cosmic consciousness,

48:09.780 --> 48:10.660
 but.

48:10.660 --> 48:11.500
 We're gonna get to that.

48:11.500 --> 48:12.340
 Yeah, yeah.

48:12.340 --> 48:14.500
 No, we definitely have to get back to that.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.700
 But getting back to, yeah, so my origins.

48:16.700 --> 48:18.620
 So I always say like, and I wanna try this on you.

48:18.620 --> 48:20.220
 You said you wouldn't answer any of my questions,

48:20.220 --> 48:21.260
 but I'm gonna ask you some questions.

48:21.260 --> 48:23.020
 What's the most important day on the calendar?

48:23.020 --> 48:24.540
 Don't tell me the date, but to you,

48:24.540 --> 48:27.940
 what's the most important day to you every year?

48:27.940 --> 48:29.580
 Do I have to answer or do I have to think about it?

48:29.580 --> 48:30.500
 No, no, answer.

48:30.500 --> 48:31.900
 Like, you don't have to tell me the exact date

48:31.900 --> 48:32.740
 of the calendar.

48:32.740 --> 48:35.380
 It could be like your mistress's birthday or whatever, but.

48:35.380 --> 48:39.140
 I have so many I lose track, even though I'm single.

48:39.140 --> 48:40.380
 How does that even make sense?

48:40.380 --> 48:41.220
 I know.

48:41.220 --> 48:42.140
 Okay, I'm sorry.

48:42.140 --> 48:46.220
 So a day, like a month and a day, yeah.

48:46.220 --> 48:49.540
 I mean, for me, it would be December 31st.

48:49.540 --> 48:52.500
 Yeah, so I was gonna say New Year's Eve, New Year's Day.

48:52.500 --> 48:54.900
 Some people say birthday, anniversary, kid's birth.

48:54.900 --> 48:58.220
 They're usually signifying beginnings and ends, right?

48:58.220 --> 49:00.420
 January means the portal between,

49:00.420 --> 49:02.700
 the God was the portal between the beginning and the end.

49:02.700 --> 49:05.100
 So you're looking back, maybe because you're Russian,

49:05.100 --> 49:06.900
 like the death side, the light side,

49:06.900 --> 49:10.220
 looking forward into January, the beginning, right?

49:10.220 --> 49:15.220
 So everybody's most important day is usually some beginning

49:15.980 --> 49:17.260
 or something significant.

49:17.260 --> 49:19.260
 For me, it was studying the most significant thing of all.

49:19.260 --> 49:20.620
 It's like, when did the universe get born,

49:20.620 --> 49:21.940
 as I said before?

49:21.940 --> 49:24.940
 And I didn't think there, again, I didn't,

49:24.940 --> 49:27.180
 I just, there was some mental obstruction

49:27.180 --> 49:30.540
 that I didn't realize that I could get past

49:30.540 --> 49:32.700
 because I didn't think like anybody does it.

49:32.700 --> 49:34.820
 Like I knew astronomers knew these answers,

49:34.820 --> 49:37.380
 like the universe at that time, between 10 and 20 billion

49:37.380 --> 49:38.220
 years old.

49:38.220 --> 49:41.740
 Now we know it's 13.872 billion years old.

49:41.740 --> 49:43.500
 It's incredible the five digit, you know,

49:43.500 --> 49:44.620
 per significant five.

49:44.620 --> 49:48.940
 What is it again? 13.872 billion years.

49:48.940 --> 49:50.860
 872 million.

49:50.860 --> 49:52.900
 So is there a lot of plus or minus on that?

49:52.900 --> 49:53.740
 Is it, what are the error bars on that?

49:53.740 --> 49:55.260
 So for me, I'm 50.

49:55.260 --> 49:57.340
 So it would be the equivalent of you looking at me

49:57.340 --> 49:59.500
 and telling me within 12 hours how old I am.

49:59.500 --> 50:00.340
 Yeah.

50:00.340 --> 50:02.460
 It's a half a percent, percent level accuracy.

50:02.460 --> 50:04.020
 There's a confidence behind that?

50:04.020 --> 50:05.380
 Oh yeah. I mean, there's a significance.

50:05.380 --> 50:07.100
 Yeah. No, it's extremely well measured.

50:07.100 --> 50:09.100
 I mean, it's one of the most precise things that we have.

50:09.100 --> 50:12.300
 In contrast to, again, 25 years ago,

50:12.300 --> 50:14.580
 we didn't know if the universe was 10 billion

50:14.580 --> 50:16.020
 or 20 billion years old,

50:16.020 --> 50:18.860
 but there were stars in our galaxy that were believed to be

50:18.860 --> 50:21.100
 as they are about 12 billion years old

50:21.100 --> 50:22.660
 or in the universe that were 12 billion.

50:22.660 --> 50:26.700
 So that would be like you being older than your father.

50:26.700 --> 50:27.660
 It was embarrassing.

50:27.660 --> 50:30.340
 Can we actually take a tangent on a tangent,

50:30.340 --> 50:31.820
 on a tangent, on a tangent?

50:31.820 --> 50:33.420
 How old is the universe?

50:33.420 --> 50:35.980
 Can you dig in onto this number?

50:35.980 --> 50:38.540
 How do we know currently with those,

50:38.540 --> 50:42.740
 I guess you said four or five significant digits?

50:42.740 --> 50:44.900
 So we can come about it from two different ways.

50:44.900 --> 50:47.920
 One, basically they rely on the most important number

50:47.920 --> 50:50.280
 in cosmology, which is called the Hubble constant.

50:50.280 --> 50:52.660
 The Hubble constant is this weird number

50:52.660 --> 50:54.180
 that has the following units.

50:54.180 --> 50:58.300
 It has the units of kilometers per second per megaparsec.

50:58.300 --> 51:00.340
 So it's a speed per distance,

51:00.340 --> 51:02.860
 which means you multiply it by distance and you get a speed.

51:02.860 --> 51:04.300
 And what is the speed you're measuring?

51:04.300 --> 51:06.140
 Well, you're measuring the speed of a distant galaxy

51:06.140 --> 51:07.900
 at many megaparsecs away.

51:07.900 --> 51:09.580
 So a galaxy at one megaparsec away,

51:09.580 --> 51:10.860
 this isn't actually strictly true

51:10.860 --> 51:12.940
 because of local gravitational effects.

51:12.940 --> 51:15.460
 But if you go out, say one megaparsec away,

51:15.460 --> 51:17.820
 I would say that that galaxy is moving 72 kilometers

51:17.820 --> 51:19.140
 per second away from you.

51:19.140 --> 51:21.620
 And every galaxy, except for the local,

51:21.620 --> 51:23.480
 very most local group surrounding us,

51:23.480 --> 51:25.220
 maybe a half a dozen galaxies,

51:25.220 --> 51:30.220
 out of 500 billion galaxies to perhaps a trillion galaxies.

51:30.220 --> 51:33.460
 So 12 out of that number are moving towards us,

51:33.460 --> 51:35.100
 the rest are moving away from us.

51:35.100 --> 51:38.140
 So that number, if you invert it,

51:38.140 --> 51:40.940
 if you say, well, when did those things last touch each other,

51:40.940 --> 51:43.460
 all those galaxies, now they're really far apart,

51:43.460 --> 51:44.740
 we know how fast they're moving away.

51:44.740 --> 51:46.700
 It's a very simple algebra problem to solve.

51:46.700 --> 51:47.820
 When were they touching?

51:47.820 --> 51:49.660
 That's where you get that number from.

51:49.660 --> 51:51.900
 So there's the local 12 and then the rest.

51:51.900 --> 51:52.740
 Ignore the 12, yeah.

51:52.740 --> 51:54.860
 And then ignore the 12 and then look at the others

51:54.860 --> 51:57.140
 and yeah, then solve the algebra problem.

51:57.140 --> 52:02.140
 How does the stuff in the beginning,

52:03.980 --> 52:05.620
 the mystery of that beginning epoch

52:05.620 --> 52:07.420
 change this calculation of?

52:07.420 --> 52:10.820
 Very little, because actually we understand

52:10.820 --> 52:12.820
 how there's some other ingredients that go into it,

52:12.820 --> 52:14.860
 namely how much dark energy there is in the universe,

52:14.860 --> 52:16.420
 how much dark matter there is in the universe,

52:16.420 --> 52:19.940
 how much radiation, light, neutrinos, et cetera there are,

52:19.940 --> 52:21.280
 and how much ordinary matter,

52:21.280 --> 52:24.660
 like we're made up of neutrons, protons, croutons.

52:24.660 --> 52:29.060
 Okay, so let me, morons.

52:31.300 --> 52:36.300
 It appears that the universe is bigger than it is older.

52:37.500 --> 52:38.660
 How does that make sense?

52:38.660 --> 52:40.460
 Oh, oh, yeah, so you're talking about the fact

52:40.460 --> 52:43.900
 that we can actually see stuff in our observable universe

52:43.900 --> 52:46.780
 that's located at a distance that is farther

52:46.780 --> 52:49.740
 than the speed of light times the age of the universe.

52:49.740 --> 52:51.600
 Naively you would say that,

52:51.600 --> 52:54.640
 so you're right, if the universe were static,

52:54.640 --> 52:56.220
 if the universe came into existence,

52:56.220 --> 52:57.500
 and you can conceive of this,

52:57.500 --> 53:00.460
 the universe came into a big bang in a fixed universe,

53:00.460 --> 53:02.700
 so the universe just started off,

53:02.700 --> 53:05.360
 those galaxies were, they could be moving

53:05.360 --> 53:07.720
 towards us, away from us, who knows,

53:07.720 --> 53:09.960
 that you could say I can see a galaxy

53:09.960 --> 53:13.740
 that's at a distance of only 13.8 billion years

53:13.740 --> 53:15.900
 times the speed of light, that would be true.

53:15.900 --> 53:18.340
 But the fact that the light is expanding

53:18.340 --> 53:20.440
 along with the expansion of the universe,

53:20.440 --> 53:23.140
 so imagine there was some very distant past,

53:23.140 --> 53:25.940
 we were near a galaxy, it's gonna produce some light,

53:25.940 --> 53:28.300
 and that galaxy's going to be moving away from us,

53:28.300 --> 53:30.380
 the light's gonna be getting more and more red shifted

53:30.380 --> 53:31.940
 as it's called, and it's gonna be moving

53:31.940 --> 53:34.820
 farther and farther away from us as time goes on,

53:34.820 --> 53:35.900
 there'll be some acceleration

53:35.900 --> 53:38.700
 as we get into the era of dark energy.

53:38.700 --> 53:41.640
 The light signals, there'll be some cone of acceptance,

53:41.640 --> 53:45.180
 if you will, from which, which represents all the events

53:45.180 --> 53:47.700
 that we could have received information from.

53:47.700 --> 53:50.900
 We can't currently communicate with that galaxy.

53:50.900 --> 53:53.500
 It sent us some light, and now it's moving away,

53:53.500 --> 53:55.480
 and it sent us some light, and because the space

53:55.480 --> 53:57.860
 is also dragging the photons with it, if you like,

53:57.860 --> 53:59.820
 the photons are participating

53:59.820 --> 54:01.100
 in the expansion of the universe,

54:01.100 --> 54:02.520
 that's why they're red shifting,

54:02.520 --> 54:05.260
 that we can see things out to where the universe

54:05.260 --> 54:09.220
 first began expanding, not just when it began existing.

54:09.220 --> 54:10.680
 And because the universe has been expanding

54:10.680 --> 54:14.100
 for 13.8 billion years, with no sign of slowing down yet,

54:14.100 --> 54:18.060
 which is a huge surprise, serendipitous surprise,

54:18.060 --> 54:20.300
 that we can see things approximately three times

54:20.300 --> 54:22.140
 the age of the universe away from us.

54:22.140 --> 54:24.100
 So we can see, it's called the age of the universe,

54:24.100 --> 54:26.240
 15 billion years, just to make the math simple.

54:26.240 --> 54:29.640
 We see things at 45 billion light years distance

54:29.640 --> 54:32.540
 in that direction, and we see things at 45 billion

54:32.540 --> 54:34.260
 light years in that direction,

54:34.260 --> 54:36.860
 just turning our telescopes 180 degrees away.

54:36.860 --> 54:39.360
 So that means we see things that themselves

54:39.360 --> 54:42.560
 are 90 billion light years away from each other.

54:42.560 --> 54:45.360
 That's sort of the diameter of the observable universe.

54:45.360 --> 54:47.100
 Is there another universe beyond that?

54:47.100 --> 54:47.920
 We don't know.

54:47.920 --> 54:49.660
 So in conjecture, there's not only one,

54:49.660 --> 54:51.260
 there's an infinite number of them.

54:51.260 --> 54:54.300
 How are you emotionally okay with the fact

54:54.300 --> 54:55.980
 that our universe is expanding?

54:55.980 --> 54:56.820
 So like...

54:56.820 --> 55:00.220
 It's gonna be like Annie Hall, like with Alvy Singer.

55:00.220 --> 55:02.540
 I grew up in the Soviet Union.

55:02.540 --> 55:03.620
 We watched propaganda films.

55:03.620 --> 55:05.420
 I realized that you did, yes.

55:05.420 --> 55:07.860
 So there's a famous... Annie Hall, is that some kind of...

55:07.860 --> 55:08.680
 What is the...

55:08.680 --> 55:12.940
 It's a comedy, it's a propaganda movie with Woody Allen.

55:12.940 --> 55:14.940
 Certainly canceled, but nevertheless,

55:14.940 --> 55:17.660
 back when he was not canceled yet,

55:17.660 --> 55:19.080
 he made a movie called Annie Hall,

55:19.080 --> 55:21.820
 in which as a self depiction, he's like a Larry David

55:21.820 --> 55:23.660
 before Larry David was Larry David,

55:23.660 --> 55:26.060
 neurotic, typical neurotic young Jew.

55:26.060 --> 55:28.780
 He's in Brooklyn and he all of a sudden tells his mother

55:28.780 --> 55:29.940
 he's not doing his homework anymore.

55:29.940 --> 55:31.340
 He refuses to do his homework.

55:31.340 --> 55:32.380
 Mother says, why?

55:32.380 --> 55:34.020
 Goes, because the universe is expanding

55:34.020 --> 55:36.180
 and it keeps on expanding.

55:36.180 --> 55:37.100
 Everything will rip apart

55:37.100 --> 55:38.980
 and then we'll never have anything in contact

55:38.980 --> 55:40.460
 and everything is meaningless.

55:40.460 --> 55:43.860
 I assume these are some of the topics we're gonna get to.

55:43.860 --> 55:45.620
 And she goes, what are you talking about?

55:45.620 --> 55:46.780
 We're in Brooklyn.

55:46.780 --> 55:49.100
 Brooklyn is not expanding.

55:49.100 --> 55:50.820
 And that's true, Brooklyn is not expanding.

55:50.820 --> 55:52.660
 The solar system is not expanding.

55:52.660 --> 55:53.580
 Often times they get asked,

55:53.580 --> 55:55.500
 what is the universe expanding into?

55:55.500 --> 55:57.340
 That's one of my favorite questions.

55:57.340 --> 55:59.020
 What is it expanding into?

55:59.020 --> 56:00.940
 And I say, it's actually an easy question

56:00.940 --> 56:02.340
 if you think about it.

56:02.340 --> 56:04.780
 You've seen your friend Elon, he goes out into space,

56:04.780 --> 56:05.900
 he's got a rocket, right?

56:05.900 --> 56:07.840
 What's outside of the rocket?

56:07.840 --> 56:10.120
 If you take this bottle, empty out this bottle,

56:10.120 --> 56:13.260
 take the cap off it, go outside the rocket,

56:13.260 --> 56:16.060
 sip in some Tang, screw on the cover of it,

56:16.060 --> 56:17.060
 what's in there?

56:18.260 --> 56:19.120
 Is it empty?

56:20.720 --> 56:24.780
 That's just semantics, I guess, yeah.

56:24.780 --> 56:26.020
 No, it's definitely not empty.

56:26.020 --> 56:27.780
 So you step outside the rocket.

56:27.780 --> 56:29.480
 Yeah, you're in the vacuum of space,

56:29.480 --> 56:30.320
 the quote unquote vacuum of space.

56:30.320 --> 56:31.780
 And there's no more liquid in it.

56:31.780 --> 56:32.620
 There's no more liquid in it.

56:32.620 --> 56:33.780
 No, it's just a container.

56:33.780 --> 56:35.860
 One cubic centimeter, let's make it simple.

56:35.860 --> 56:38.200
 One cubic centimeter of a box

56:38.200 --> 56:39.400
 and you take it out into space,

56:39.400 --> 56:41.620
 outside of a Falcon, whatever, right?

56:42.700 --> 56:44.020
 What's inside that box?

56:44.020 --> 56:45.100
 It's not empty.

56:45.100 --> 56:47.340
 There's actually, I'm gonna say,

56:47.340 --> 56:48.460
 this is gonna set your friends up.

56:48.460 --> 56:53.140
 There's 420 photons from the fusion of the light elements

56:53.140 --> 56:54.900
 that we call the cosmic microwave background

56:54.900 --> 56:56.580
 inside that box at any second.

56:56.580 --> 56:58.460
 Okay, all right, hold on a second.

56:58.460 --> 57:03.340
 What, 420, I've heard of that number before.

57:03.340 --> 57:04.160
 All right, let's.

57:04.160 --> 57:06.780
 It used to be 69, but then they changed it.

57:06.780 --> 57:09.260
 Wow, physics works in mysterious ways.

57:09.260 --> 57:10.940
 In a millimeter box, it's 69.

57:10.940 --> 57:12.740
 What are we talking about here?

57:12.740 --> 57:16.460
 What's inside, what's in the box?

57:16.460 --> 57:18.020
 I'm gonna get, that's right.

57:18.020 --> 57:19.060
 Let's think outside the box.

57:19.060 --> 57:20.220
 No, we're thinking inside the box.

57:20.220 --> 57:22.380
 So if you have, every cubic centimeter

57:22.380 --> 57:25.340
 of our observable universe is suffused with heat

57:25.340 --> 57:28.520
 left over from the Big Bang, dark matter particles.

57:28.520 --> 57:31.860
 There's a little ordinary matter in the universe.

57:31.860 --> 57:33.020
 And every cubic centimeter,

57:33.020 --> 57:34.700
 there's some probability to find a proton,

57:34.700 --> 57:37.580
 a cosmic ray, an electron, et cetera.

57:37.580 --> 57:39.660
 There's actually an awful lot of neutrinos

57:39.660 --> 57:41.320
 inside of that cubic centimeter.

57:41.320 --> 57:43.020
 Now just imagine how many cubic centimeters

57:43.020 --> 57:44.540
 are in the universe, it's enormous.

57:44.540 --> 57:46.640
 That's why there's enormous numbers of particles

57:46.640 --> 57:48.920
 in our universe, it's a very rich universe.

57:48.920 --> 57:51.140
 But now let's zoom in on that box.

57:51.140 --> 57:54.000
 So now inside that box, there might be one,

57:54.000 --> 57:56.260
 let's say there might be one ordinary matter,

57:56.260 --> 58:00.000
 like a proton or an electron, a baryon, a lepton.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.160
 There might be a couple hundred neutrinos

58:03.160 --> 58:07.000
 and there'll be a couple hundred photons, as I said, 420.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.520
 What's between those guys?

58:08.520 --> 58:13.120
 What's between the protons and the neutrinos

58:13.120 --> 58:14.120
 and the photons?

58:14.120 --> 58:16.720
 Like just zoom into a cubic micron now.

58:16.720 --> 58:19.400
 Like imagine 420 things inside a box this big.

58:19.400 --> 58:20.640
 It's actually pretty empty.

58:20.640 --> 58:22.400
 Like they're just zipping around in there, right?

58:22.400 --> 58:24.480
 So between them, there's a lot of empty space.

58:24.480 --> 58:27.960
 And this is outside the kind of physics based models

58:27.960 --> 58:29.560
 of fields and all those kinds of things,

58:29.560 --> 58:32.720
 just like asking the question of like,

58:32.720 --> 58:33.560
 what is this emptiness?

58:33.560 --> 58:35.880
 What's the particle content in the universe

58:35.880 --> 58:38.440
 in every cubic centimeter of the universe?

58:38.440 --> 58:39.720
 Outside of the 420.

58:39.720 --> 58:44.480
 So you have the 420, they have some mass.

58:44.480 --> 58:45.600
 Well, they have energy, they don't have mass.

58:45.600 --> 58:47.320
 Photons don't have mass.

58:47.320 --> 58:48.520
 That's why they don't bring suitcases.

58:48.520 --> 58:50.080
 You know, that's true, right?

58:50.080 --> 58:53.040
 Photons never bring suitcases with them

58:53.040 --> 58:55.200
 because they're traveling light.

58:55.200 --> 58:56.960
 See, I don't even get to laugh at you.

58:56.960 --> 58:58.340
 That's corny dad jokes.

58:58.340 --> 58:59.560
 Okay, you'll appreciate some.

58:59.560 --> 59:01.520
 No, this is pretty good.

59:01.520 --> 59:02.880
 I'm laughing on the insides.

59:02.880 --> 59:03.920
 What's in the box?

59:03.920 --> 59:04.800
 What's the 420?

59:04.800 --> 59:07.440
 What's between the photons?

59:07.440 --> 59:08.480
 That's what space is.

59:08.480 --> 59:10.400
 That's what the universe is expanding into.

59:10.400 --> 59:13.720
 Okay, so that's the notebook

59:13.720 --> 59:16.320
 on which the photons are written.

59:16.320 --> 59:17.160
 That's beautiful.

59:17.160 --> 59:19.480
 But still, thank you.

59:19.480 --> 59:24.440
 Still, I understand this, but it's still uncomfortable

59:24.440 --> 59:27.720
 that if the universe is expanding,

59:27.720 --> 59:31.540
 that this thing is expanding, the canvas is expanding.

59:31.540 --> 59:33.280
 It's very strange.

59:33.280 --> 59:35.280
 Because like if we were just sitting there still,

59:35.280 --> 59:37.740
 I guess if we're in Brooklyn, nothing's expanding.

59:37.740 --> 59:41.920
 So our cognition, our intuition about the world

59:41.920 --> 59:44.000
 is based on this local fact

59:44.000 --> 59:49.000
 that we don't get to experience this kind of expansion.

59:49.560 --> 59:52.440
 Yeah, and that intuition leads us astray.

59:52.440 --> 59:54.440
 But you know that gravity is the weakest

59:54.440 --> 59:56.480
 of the so called four fundamental forces.

59:57.360 --> 1:00:00.040
 And yet it has the longest range pervasiveness.

1:00:00.040 --> 1:00:01.840
 Gravity is, you know, we're being pulled

1:00:01.840 --> 1:00:05.360
 towards the Andromeda galaxy at some enormous rate of speed

1:00:05.360 --> 1:00:07.840
 because of its massive counter gravitational force

1:00:07.840 --> 1:00:09.680
 to the force we exert on it.

1:00:09.680 --> 1:00:13.720
 So gravity is enormously long range, but incredibly weak.

1:00:13.720 --> 1:00:17.720
 And because of that, we can think about these effects

1:00:17.720 --> 1:00:21.920
 of expansion as the relationship between the,

1:00:21.920 --> 1:00:25.560
 as you said, the grid lines on the notebook, right?

1:00:25.560 --> 1:00:29.720
 Gravity is a manifestation of the interrelationship

1:00:29.720 --> 1:00:33.160
 between those points, how far they are from each other.

1:00:33.160 --> 1:00:36.400
 And those can change, those point distances can change

1:00:36.400 --> 1:00:39.160
 over time because of the force of gravity.

1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:43.040
 So it's weak and what we experience as gravity

1:00:43.040 --> 1:00:46.600
 is the changing of those trajectories

1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:48.900
 from being rectilinear to curvilinear.

1:00:48.900 --> 1:00:51.200
 That's what we experience as gravity.

1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:53.440
 You had this analogy when you talked to Barry Barish

1:00:53.440 --> 1:00:55.760
 about bowling ball and a trampoline.

1:00:55.760 --> 1:00:57.880
 That's almost right because it's actually,

1:00:57.880 --> 1:01:00.120
 you have to visualize that now in four dimensions,

1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:02.120
 like wrapping a trampoline at every point

1:01:02.120 --> 1:01:04.400
 around the object, including on the sides,

1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:06.240
 and it becomes very hard to visualize.

1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:08.080
 So a lot of people use that.

1:01:08.080 --> 1:01:11.100
 It's also a fraught analogy because you're using gravity,

1:01:11.100 --> 1:01:13.420
 like the notion of gravity pulling something down

1:01:13.420 --> 1:01:15.160
 to explain the notion of gravity.

1:01:15.160 --> 1:01:18.320
 So it's a little overburdening, the analogy.

1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:20.020
 But okay, so you mentioned Barry Barish

1:01:20.020 --> 1:01:22.400
 wrote the forward to your book.

1:01:22.400 --> 1:01:24.800
 How do gravitational waves fit into all of this?

1:01:24.800 --> 1:01:26.740
 How do they, on the emotional level,

1:01:26.740 --> 1:01:28.800
 how do they make you feel that they're just

1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:30.960
 moving space time?

1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:33.160
 Yeah, so gravitational waves were,

1:01:33.160 --> 1:01:35.560
 the Nobel Prize for gravitational waves discovery

1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:39.140
 the first time, it was discovered twice,

1:01:39.140 --> 1:01:43.900
 indirectly by two men named Halcyon Taylor,

1:01:43.900 --> 1:01:45.920
 and that was given my first year of graduate school.

1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:47.840
 The day I entered graduate school almost,

1:01:47.840 --> 1:01:49.720
 they announced these two guys won it,

1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:51.160
 and the guy who won it did the work

1:01:51.160 --> 1:01:52.720
 that would later win him the Nobel Prize

1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:53.560
 when he was my age.

1:01:53.560 --> 1:01:55.080
 Is this in the 40s?

1:01:55.080 --> 1:01:56.880
 This was, no, this is 19.

1:01:56.880 --> 1:01:57.720
 That was a joke.

1:01:57.720 --> 1:01:59.120
 Yeah, that was good, that was good.

1:01:59.120 --> 1:01:59.940
 I got it, I got it.

1:01:59.940 --> 1:02:02.840
 You know, to a cosmologist, age means nothing.

1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:03.920
 And to a tennis player.

1:02:03.920 --> 1:02:04.840
 Not on Tinder.

1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:06.680
 That's right.

1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:07.640
 All right, sorry.

1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:09.500
 Gravitational waves do fit in

1:02:09.500 --> 1:02:12.080
 because what we're trying to do now

1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:15.120
 is use the properties of gravitational waves,

1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:18.260
 the analogous properties that they have to photons,

1:02:18.260 --> 1:02:20.100
 that they travel at the speed of light,

1:02:20.100 --> 1:02:21.180
 that they go through everything,

1:02:21.180 --> 1:02:22.680
 they can go through everything,

1:02:22.680 --> 1:02:24.640
 and that they're directly detectable.

1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:28.600
 We're using them to try to confirm

1:02:28.600 --> 1:02:32.000
 if or if not inflation occurred.

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.800
 So did inflation, the spark that ignited

1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:37.200
 the fusion of the elements in the early part of the universe

1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:39.520
 and the initial expansion of the universe,

1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:40.640
 did that take place?

1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:43.240
 There's only one way that cosmologists believe

1:02:43.240 --> 1:02:44.560
 we could ever see that.

1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:46.040
 Through the imprint

1:02:46.040 --> 1:02:48.400
 of these primordial gravitational waves,

1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:51.440
 not these old newcomers that Barry studies,

1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:55.080
 the ones that occurred a billion light years away from us,

1:02:55.080 --> 1:02:56.720
 a billion years ago,

1:02:56.720 --> 1:02:59.560
 but we're seeing things that happened 13.82 billion years ago

1:02:59.560 --> 1:03:02.000
 during the inflationary epoch.

1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:05.520
 However, those, we cannot build a LIGO

1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:07.920
 and put it at the Big Bang.

1:03:07.920 --> 1:03:09.320
 So if you want to measure,

1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:12.520
 let's say you have the old time firecracker,

1:03:12.520 --> 1:03:13.680
 let's say there's a firecracker,

1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:15.240
 and you want to see if it went off

1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:16.840
 in the building next door to you,

1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:18.040
 you can't see it.

1:03:18.040 --> 1:03:21.080
 So you can't see the imprint of it, but you can hear it.

1:03:21.080 --> 1:03:22.960
 And what we're trying to do is hear

1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:25.720
 the effect of gravitational waves from the Big Bang,

1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:29.320
 not by using a camera or even an interferometer

1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:31.760
 like Barry used and his colleagues,

1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:35.280
 but instead using the CMB, the light,

1:03:35.280 --> 1:03:37.840
 the primordial ancient fossils of the universe,

1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:39.600
 the oldest light in the universe.

1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:43.000
 We're gonna use that as a film, quote unquote,

1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:46.040
 onto which gravitational waves get exposed.

1:03:46.040 --> 1:03:48.600
 And hope you can, so what are the challenges there

1:03:48.600 --> 1:03:51.840
 to get enough accuracy for the exposure?

1:03:51.840 --> 1:03:53.960
 So the signal, as I said,

1:03:53.960 --> 1:03:56.840
 so there's 420 of these photons per cubic centimeter,

1:03:56.840 --> 1:03:59.280
 and there's a lot of cubic centimeters in the universe.

1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:00.800
 However, what we're looking for

1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:04.840
 is not the brightness of the photon, how intense it is.

1:04:04.840 --> 1:04:07.480
 We're not looking for its color, what wavelength it is.

1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:10.200
 We're looking for what its polarization is.

1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:11.800
 And we'll go, let me just ask,

1:04:11.800 --> 1:04:13.960
 are you serious about the per cubic millimeter,

1:04:13.960 --> 1:04:15.040
 420 is the number?

1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:15.880
 Centimeter.

1:04:15.880 --> 1:04:20.240
 Yes, cubic centimeter, 420 is the number.

1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:21.560
 I wonder if Elon knows this,

1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:23.680
 and if he doesn't, he will truly enjoy this.

1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:26.680
 Okay, yeah, that's true.

1:04:26.680 --> 1:04:29.280
 Oh, okay, funding security, excellent.

1:04:30.280 --> 1:04:34.080
 So I mean, this takes us to this story of heartbreak,

1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:38.360
 of triumph that you described in losing the Nobel Prize.

1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:42.360
 So describe what polarization is that you mentioned.

1:04:42.360 --> 1:04:46.080
 Can you describe what bicep one and bicep two are,

1:04:46.080 --> 1:04:48.800
 bicep three, perhaps, the instruments

1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:51.440
 that can detect this kind of polarization?

1:04:51.440 --> 1:04:54.960
 What are the challenges, the origin story, the whole thing?

1:04:54.960 --> 1:04:57.640
 Yeah, so well, the origin story goes back again

1:04:57.640 --> 1:05:00.200
 to like a father son rivalry, it really does.

1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:02.440
 My father won all these prizes, awards, et cetera,

1:05:02.440 --> 1:05:04.200
 but he never won a Nobel Prize.

1:05:04.200 --> 1:05:08.000
 And some parents in America, they compete with their kids.

1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:10.120
 Oh, I was a football player in high school, I'll show you.

1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:11.640
 And whatever, wrestling, whatever.

1:05:11.640 --> 1:05:13.840
 And some of us could be healthy too.

1:05:13.840 --> 1:05:17.280
 But with me and my dad, it wasn't super healthy.

1:05:17.280 --> 1:05:20.560
 Like we would compete and he was much more

1:05:20.560 --> 1:05:23.080
 of a pure mathematician and I was an experimental physicist.

1:05:23.080 --> 1:05:25.080
 So we had both different ideas

1:05:25.080 --> 1:05:27.720
 in what was worth prioritizing our time.

1:05:27.720 --> 1:05:30.040
 But I knew for sure he didn't win the Nobel Prize.

1:05:30.040 --> 1:05:32.240
 And I knew I could kind of outdo him.

1:05:32.240 --> 1:05:35.780
 So I feel pretty venal and kind of minuscule

1:05:35.780 --> 1:05:37.240
 kind of character wise saying that.

1:05:37.240 --> 1:05:38.800
 The only reason you could outdo him

1:05:38.800 --> 1:05:41.760
 is because the Fields Medal is given every four years.

1:05:41.760 --> 1:05:43.920
 And only if you're under 40, which he was.

1:05:43.920 --> 1:05:47.640
 So he's working under much more limited conditions.

1:05:47.640 --> 1:05:50.800
 That's right, so even if I had, which spoiler alert,

1:05:50.800 --> 1:05:53.560
 the book's called Losing the Nobel Prize, so I didn't do it.

1:05:53.560 --> 1:05:54.920
 But I wanted to do something big

1:05:54.920 --> 1:05:58.080
 and I wanted to do something that would really

1:05:58.080 --> 1:06:01.080
 just unequivocally be realized as in a discovery

1:06:01.080 --> 1:06:02.840
 for the ages, as in fact it was

1:06:02.840 --> 1:06:04.380
 when we made the premature announcement

1:06:04.380 --> 1:06:05.760
 that we had been successful.

1:06:05.760 --> 1:06:10.520
 So you were from the beginning reaching for the big questions.

1:06:10.520 --> 1:06:11.440
 That's all I cared about.

1:06:11.440 --> 1:06:14.480
 As an experimenter you were swinging for the fences.

1:06:14.480 --> 1:06:15.680
 That's all I wanted to do.

1:06:15.680 --> 1:06:20.680
 I felt like if it's not, if it's worth spending

1:06:20.920 --> 1:06:24.320
 perhaps the rest of my life on as a scientist,

1:06:24.320 --> 1:06:26.600
 it better be damn well better be interesting to me

1:06:26.600 --> 1:06:29.120
 to carry me through, to give me the,

1:06:29.120 --> 1:06:31.480
 I always say passion is great when people say,

1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:33.720
 oh, follow your passion, but it's not enough.

1:06:33.720 --> 1:06:35.880
 Passion's like the spark that ignites the rocket,

1:06:35.880 --> 1:06:38.520
 but that's not enough to get the rocket into space.

1:06:38.520 --> 1:06:41.840
 So then you swung for the fences with Bicep One.

1:06:41.840 --> 1:06:42.760
 What is this?

1:06:42.760 --> 1:06:45.240
 So Bicep One was born out of

1:06:45.240 --> 1:06:46.520
 kind of interesting circumstances.

1:06:46.520 --> 1:06:49.880
 So I had gone to Stanford University for a postdoc,

1:06:49.880 --> 1:06:51.680
 so an academic hunger games.

1:06:51.680 --> 1:06:54.480
 Stanford? Stanford University.

1:06:54.480 --> 1:06:56.240
 Yeah, it's this small little school.

1:06:56.240 --> 1:06:59.200
 It's not like that technical college in Massachusetts

1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:00.660
 that you're affiliated with.

1:07:00.660 --> 1:07:04.160
 But as I went there, I was working

1:07:04.160 --> 1:07:05.760
 for a new assistant professor.

1:07:05.760 --> 1:07:08.960
 She had gotten there only a year before I got there,

1:07:08.960 --> 1:07:10.440
 and she had her own priorities,

1:07:10.440 --> 1:07:12.040
 the things that she wanted to do.

1:07:12.040 --> 1:07:14.500
 But I kept thinking in my spare time

1:07:14.500 --> 1:07:16.100
 that I wanted to do something completely different.

1:07:16.100 --> 1:07:17.700
 She was studying galaxies at high redshift,

1:07:17.700 --> 1:07:19.800
 and I wanted to study the origin of the universe

1:07:19.800 --> 1:07:22.200
 using this type of technology.

1:07:22.200 --> 1:07:25.400
 And I realized, courtesy of a good friend of mine

1:07:25.400 --> 1:07:28.320
 who's now at Johns Hopkins, Mark Haminkowski,

1:07:28.320 --> 1:07:30.580
 that we didn't need this enormous Hubble telescope.

1:07:30.580 --> 1:07:33.000
 We didn't need a 30 meter diameter telescope.

1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.280
 We needed a tiny refracting telescope,

1:07:35.280 --> 1:07:38.200
 no bigger than my head, less than a foot across.

1:07:38.200 --> 1:07:40.080
 And that telescope would have the same power

1:07:40.080 --> 1:07:43.120
 as a Hubble telescope, size telescope could have,

1:07:43.120 --> 1:07:44.560
 because the signals that we're looking for

1:07:44.560 --> 1:07:46.800
 are enormous in wavelength on the sky.

1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:50.340
 They're enormously long, large area signals on the sky.

1:07:50.340 --> 1:07:52.240
 And if we could measure that,

1:07:52.240 --> 1:07:53.520
 it would be proof, effectively,

1:07:53.520 --> 1:07:54.940
 as close as you get to proof,

1:07:54.940 --> 1:07:55.960
 there could be things that mimic it,

1:07:55.960 --> 1:07:58.900
 but that we discovered the inflationary epoch.

1:07:58.900 --> 1:08:01.600
 Inflation being the signal originally conceived

1:08:01.600 --> 1:08:04.240
 by Alan Guth to explain why the universe

1:08:04.240 --> 1:08:06.440
 had the large scale features that it does,

1:08:06.440 --> 1:08:09.040
 namely that it has so called flat geometry.

1:08:09.040 --> 1:08:12.120
 So there's no way to make a triangle in space

1:08:12.120 --> 1:08:15.340
 in our universe that has three interior angles

1:08:15.340 --> 1:08:18.240
 that do not sum to 180 degrees.

1:08:18.240 --> 1:08:19.600
 You can do that with spacecraft,

1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:20.600
 you can do that with stars,

1:08:20.600 --> 1:08:21.600
 you can do that with laser beams,

1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:23.600
 you can do that with three different galaxies.

1:08:23.600 --> 1:08:25.760
 All those galaxies, no matter how far you go,

1:08:25.760 --> 1:08:27.840
 have this geometry, it's remarkable.

1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:30.880
 But it's also unstable, it's very unlikely,

1:08:30.880 --> 1:08:32.960
 it's very seemingly finely tuned.

1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:34.720
 And that was one of the motivations that Guth had

1:08:34.720 --> 1:08:39.160
 to kind of conceive of this new idea called inflation 1979

1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:42.380
 when he was a postdoc also at Stanford, Slack.

1:08:42.380 --> 1:08:44.400
 And he was trying to get a permanent job,

1:08:44.400 --> 1:08:46.560
 I was trying to like make my name for myself.

1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:48.600
 And so I realized I could do this,

1:08:48.600 --> 1:08:51.820
 but I was also being paid by this professor at Stanford

1:08:51.820 --> 1:08:53.080
 to do a job for her.

1:08:53.080 --> 1:08:56.800
 And I was kind of a crappy employee, to be honest with you.

1:08:56.800 --> 1:08:58.480
 And then one day she couldn't take it anymore

1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:00.000
 because I was like sketching notebooks

1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:01.300
 and planning these experiments.

1:09:01.300 --> 1:09:03.120
 And I just, I wasn't, no, I actually.

1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:06.080
 Big ideas in your mind, you're planning big experiments.

1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:10.000
 And that was difficult to work with on a small scale

1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.320
 for like a postdoc type of situation

1:09:12.320 --> 1:09:15.320
 where you have to publish basic papers,

1:09:15.320 --> 1:09:17.800
 deliver on some basic deadlines for a project,

1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:18.640
 all those kinds of things.

1:09:18.640 --> 1:09:21.120
 And support your advisors, paying, she was paying me.

1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:26.040
 And so one day I came in and it actually involved

1:09:26.040 --> 1:09:28.800
 another friend of mine, an astronomer named Jill Tarter,

1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:31.760
 one of the pioneers in the SETI science business

1:09:31.760 --> 1:09:33.480
 of detecting extraterrestrials,

1:09:33.480 --> 1:09:35.900
 which I assume you'd never like to talk about aliens,

1:09:35.900 --> 1:09:37.900
 so I'm sure we won't get into aliens.

1:09:37.900 --> 1:09:40.180
 But Jill was visiting Stanford and I was like,

1:09:40.180 --> 1:09:41.400
 I really wanna meet her, can you introduce me?

1:09:41.400 --> 1:09:45.240
 And she said, no, in fact, you're fired, my boss.

1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:48.920
 So I was like, this is possibly the best thing

1:09:48.920 --> 1:09:50.080
 that could ever happen to me.

1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:52.640
 I didn't know where it would lead or what would happen to it,

1:09:52.640 --> 1:09:56.320
 but getting fired from this ultra prestigious university

1:09:56.320 --> 1:09:58.440
 turned out to be the path, I mean, literally,

1:09:58.440 --> 1:10:02.560
 that brings me here today, in that because of that,

1:10:02.560 --> 1:10:05.800
 I ended up working for another person in Caltech,

1:10:05.800 --> 1:10:10.080
 which is in Pasadena, and she, my original boss,

1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:12.920
 Sarah Church, she got me the job with her former advisor,

1:10:12.920 --> 1:10:14.980
 a man by the name of Andrew Lang.

1:10:14.980 --> 1:10:17.720
 And Andrew was like, he was like this, I don't know,

1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:22.720
 like he's like Steve Jobs or Elon, charismatic,

1:10:23.640 --> 1:10:27.120
 handsome, persuasive, idea man,

1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:29.260
 not the guy always in the lobby and doing everything,

1:10:29.260 --> 1:10:33.960
 but understood where things are going decades from now.

1:10:33.960 --> 1:10:35.200
 And he had been involved in an experiment

1:10:35.200 --> 1:10:37.840
 that actually measured the universe was flat,

1:10:37.840 --> 1:10:41.100
 very close to flat, along with a preceding experiment

1:10:41.100 --> 1:10:43.440
 done at Princeton by Lyman Page and other collaborators.

1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:45.240
 So the shape of the universe is flat.

1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:47.640
 The geometry of the universe is flat.

1:10:47.640 --> 1:10:49.400
 How did he do that experiment?

1:10:49.400 --> 1:10:51.880
 So he used the cosmic microwave background.

1:10:51.880 --> 1:10:54.760
 And so what I said is you have to look for triangles

1:10:54.760 --> 1:10:55.600
 in the universe.

1:10:55.600 --> 1:10:56.920
 So you can measure triangles on earth.

1:10:56.920 --> 1:10:59.960
 You can actually, it's hard to show that the earth is curved,

1:10:59.960 --> 1:11:02.000
 but you can show the earth is curved using triangles,

1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:03.000
 mountain tops, et cetera,

1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:04.840
 if you have an accurate enough protractor.

1:11:04.840 --> 1:11:05.760
 Allegedly, yeah.

1:11:05.760 --> 1:11:06.580
 Yeah.

1:11:07.580 --> 1:11:09.700
 God, you're like auto canceling.

1:11:09.700 --> 1:11:11.120
 This is great.

1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:12.400
 My ratings are gonna go up, man.

1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:13.640
 This is gonna be great.

1:11:13.640 --> 1:11:14.480
 Take out the cake.

1:11:14.480 --> 1:11:17.240
 If you want actual science, go listen to Brian.

1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:19.720
 If you want all of these conspiracy theories

1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:23.720
 or AKA the truth about flat earth, listen to him.

1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:27.360
 So what he used was the following triangle.

1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:32.280
 There are proto galaxy sized objects in the CMB.

1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:34.560
 The cosmic microwave background has these patches.

1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:37.840
 And so you can make a triangle out of the diameter

1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:41.760
 of one of these blobs of primordial plasma,

1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:43.880
 the soup that constitutes the early universe,

1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:44.720
 which is hydrogen.

1:11:44.720 --> 1:11:46.080
 It's very simple material.

1:11:46.080 --> 1:11:48.840
 Understand hydrogen electrons and radiation, very simple.

1:11:48.840 --> 1:11:51.720
 Plasma physicists, son, understand it.

1:11:51.720 --> 1:11:54.680
 The diameter is one base of the triangle.

1:11:54.680 --> 1:11:57.340
 And then the distance to the earth is the other two legs.

1:11:57.340 --> 1:12:00.000
 So he measured along with his colleagues at Caltech

1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.160
 and then University of Rome and that's other group

1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:05.740
 at Princeton, measured the angle,

1:12:05.740 --> 1:12:08.680
 interior angle effectively very, very accurately

1:12:08.680 --> 1:12:11.280
 and showed that it added up to 180 degrees.

1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:15.080
 Can you localize accurately the patches in the CMB?

1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:19.040
 Can you know where they could trace them back location wise?

1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:21.040
 You can know where they are, but more than that,

1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:22.520
 there's so many of these patches.

1:12:22.520 --> 1:12:25.680
 They're about one square degree on the sky.

1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:28.840
 The sky, you may know, a sphere has about 44,000

1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:30.520
 square degrees in a sphere.

1:12:30.520 --> 1:12:33.960
 So there's literally 44,000 of these size patches

1:12:33.960 --> 1:12:36.080
 over which he could do these kinds of measurements

1:12:36.080 --> 1:12:37.680
 to build up very good statistics.

1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:39.280
 That's not exactly how they do it

1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:41.560
 or how they did it in this experiment called Boomerang,

1:12:41.560 --> 1:12:43.840
 but they did measure very accurately

1:12:43.840 --> 1:12:46.520
 the what was called the first Doppler peak

1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:49.680
 or acoustic peak in the plasma, the primordial plasma.

1:12:49.680 --> 1:12:54.680
 So the sphere has 44, approximately 44,000 square degrees.

1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:59.760
 So to cover a sphere, that's a very kind of important

1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:01.880
 data collection thing when you're sitting on a sphere

1:13:01.880 --> 1:13:04.800
 and you're looking out into the observable universe.

1:13:04.800 --> 1:13:07.880
 So there's a lot of patches to work with.

1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:11.140
 Yeah, and in fact, a lot of the fast kind of algorithmic

1:13:11.140 --> 1:13:13.880
 decomposition of spheres and machine learning

1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:16.000
 in the early 2000s still used today

1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:18.360
 was created out of this field by data analysts

1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:21.680
 using this thing called hierarchical equal area triangles

1:13:21.680 --> 1:13:24.600
 called heel picks is what it's called.

1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:26.360
 And so just stitch all this stuff together

1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:29.640
 and stitch it together very accurately.

1:13:29.640 --> 1:13:32.160
 Yeah, get high statistical significance

1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:34.960
 in order to reduce the statistical errors,

1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:37.640
 very clean signal and a measurement device

1:13:37.640 --> 1:13:39.280
 to reduce the systematic errors.

1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:41.480
 Those are the two predominant sources of error

1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:42.640
 in any measurement.

1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:44.880
 Those that can be improved by more and more measurement,

1:13:44.880 --> 1:13:46.480
 you take more and more measurements to this table,

1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:48.240
 you'll get slightly better each time,

1:13:48.240 --> 1:13:51.040
 but you only win as the number of the one

1:13:51.040 --> 1:13:53.240
 over the square root of the number of measurements,

1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:55.560
 but the square root of 44,000 is pretty big.

1:13:55.560 --> 1:13:57.600
 So they were able to get a very accurate measurement.

1:13:57.600 --> 1:13:58.960
 Again, it's not exactly how they did it.

1:13:58.960 --> 1:14:00.920
 They also have to do a Fourier analysis,

1:14:00.920 --> 1:14:04.000
 decompose that, do a power spectrum, filtration windows.

1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:06.920
 There's a lot of work that goes into it, image analysis,

1:14:06.920 --> 1:14:09.760
 and then comparing that with cosmological parameters,

1:14:09.760 --> 1:14:12.080
 very simple model, just six different numbers

1:14:12.080 --> 1:14:14.280
 that go into a model that made a prediction.

1:14:14.280 --> 1:14:16.780
 And one of those is the geometry of the universe pops out.

1:14:16.780 --> 1:14:19.520
 And that is the universe has zero spatial curvature,

1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:20.960
 and that was called boomerang.

1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:22.540
 So he had just come off of this.

1:14:22.540 --> 1:14:25.240
 Now, let me remind you, who was the first person

1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:27.280
 to measure the curvature of the earth?

1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:29.880
 It's a guy named Aristophanes in the whatever,

1:14:29.880 --> 1:14:31.960
 lived around Aristotle's time.

1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:33.080
 His name is in the history books.

1:14:33.080 --> 1:14:35.160
 So this guy, Andrew Lang, I was like,

1:14:35.160 --> 1:14:38.040
 he's like the next Aristophanes.

1:14:38.040 --> 1:14:39.960
 I just wanted to work for this guy.

1:14:39.960 --> 1:14:41.560
 He clearly had this brand.

1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:43.920
 He was about 40 at the time, California

1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:45.800
 Scientist of the Year.

1:14:45.800 --> 1:14:48.040
 I was sure he was going to win a Nobel Prize for that.

1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:51.720
 And I knew that he, so I went down to Caltech

1:14:51.720 --> 1:14:53.120
 to give my job talk.

1:14:53.120 --> 1:14:54.860
 And he said, I love it.

1:14:54.860 --> 1:14:56.020
 You got a job.

1:14:56.020 --> 1:14:58.480
 And before I could even, before he finished the sentence,

1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:00.040
 I said, I'll take it.

1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:01.760
 It was too good to be true.

1:15:01.760 --> 1:15:03.680
 And I started working there at Caltech,

1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:05.880
 and slowly but surely, because Caltech's

1:15:05.880 --> 1:15:08.280
 a rich private university, at that time

1:15:08.280 --> 1:15:11.440
 run by a Nobel Prize winner by the name of David Baltimore,

1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:12.520
 he just wrote us a check.

1:15:12.520 --> 1:15:15.560
 Baltimore wrote us a check and said, get started on this idea.

1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:18.000
 And so we started coming up with the idea for what I later

1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:21.620
 named BICEP, background imaging cosmic extragalactic

1:15:21.620 --> 1:15:23.840
 polarization, which is kind of ironic,

1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:26.200
 because we ended up measuring galactic polarization.

1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:27.960
 We'll get to that in a minute.

1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:30.300
 But along the way, the idea was very simple.

1:15:30.300 --> 1:15:32.800
 We're going to make the simplest telescope you can possibly

1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:35.080
 make, which is a refracting telescope.

1:15:35.080 --> 1:15:37.160
 Your eyes, you have two refracting telescopes

1:15:37.160 --> 1:15:38.520
 in your head.

1:15:38.520 --> 1:15:41.440
 Only way forward is making things more complex, right?

1:15:41.440 --> 1:15:43.280
 And when you make things complex in science,

1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:46.240
 you introduce the possibility for systematic errors.

1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:48.320
 And so we wanted to build the cleanest instrument.

1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:49.400
 Turns out the cleanest instrument

1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:52.080
 you can build in astronomy is a refracting telescope.

1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:55.240
 We also had to, unlike that telescope or Galileo's,

1:15:55.240 --> 1:15:58.620
 we had to use very sensitive detectors that

1:15:58.620 --> 1:16:02.200
 were cooled less than 1 20th of the temperature

1:16:02.200 --> 1:16:04.600
 of the cosmic background itself, which

1:16:04.600 --> 1:16:07.200
 is the coolest temperature in the whole universe.

1:16:07.200 --> 1:16:10.080
 So we had to cool these down to about 0.1 or 0.2 degrees

1:16:10.080 --> 1:16:12.320
 Kelvin above absolute zero.

1:16:12.320 --> 1:16:14.880
 To do that, we needed to put it inside of a huge vacuum chamber

1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:17.960
 and suck out all the air molecules and water molecules

1:16:17.960 --> 1:16:21.020
 and take it to a very, very special place called the South

1:16:21.020 --> 1:16:24.800
 Pole Antarctica, from which I retrieved for you a patch.

1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:27.000
 There it is over there.

1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:30.360
 So when you go there, you get these bright red jackets.

1:16:30.360 --> 1:16:30.840
 Bright.

1:16:30.840 --> 1:16:31.680
 Oh, yeah.

1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:34.080
 As somebody who was born in the Soviet Union,

1:16:34.080 --> 1:16:35.560
 we obviously like to call it red.

1:16:35.560 --> 1:16:40.480
 United States Antarctic Program, the National Science

1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:41.560
 Foundation.

1:16:41.560 --> 1:16:44.360
 And the base is called the Amundsen Scott South Polar

1:16:44.360 --> 1:16:45.400
 Station.

1:16:45.400 --> 1:16:47.520
 So it's a little known fact of geopolitics

1:16:47.520 --> 1:16:51.840
 that whatever country occupies a region has ownership over it.

1:16:51.840 --> 1:16:53.340
 Now, there is a treaty in Antarctica.

1:16:53.340 --> 1:16:56.160
 You can't use it for military purposes, for mining,

1:16:56.160 --> 1:16:57.280
 et cetera, et cetera.

1:16:57.280 --> 1:16:59.400
 But I don't know if you know, but about 12 years ago,

1:16:59.400 --> 1:17:01.720
 Putin sent a submarine to the North Pole.

1:17:01.720 --> 1:17:04.320
 Now, there's no land at the North Pole, right?

1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:05.040
 So what did he do?

1:17:05.040 --> 1:17:07.800
 He stuck it in the ocean underneath.

1:17:07.800 --> 1:17:10.920
 But the South Pole is on a continent called Antarctica,

1:17:10.920 --> 1:17:13.240
 which was first reached about 110 years ago,

1:17:13.240 --> 1:17:15.440
 the first time in human history.

1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:18.200
 Antarctica means the opposite of the bear.

1:17:18.200 --> 1:17:20.680
 It means no bears there, basically opposite

1:17:20.680 --> 1:17:21.720
 of where polar bears are.

1:17:21.720 --> 1:17:23.200
 Arctic means polar bear.

1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:24.560
 That's where in the Greek.

1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:25.160
 I did not know that.

1:17:25.160 --> 1:17:25.880
 Fascinating.

1:17:25.880 --> 1:17:27.880
 So Antarctica means the opposite place of that.

1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:30.680
 Humans never even saw it, let alone went to the South Pole,

1:17:30.680 --> 1:17:33.600
 which is kind of in the middle of the continent.

1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:37.360
 We went to take this telescope somewhere extremely dry.

1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:40.680
 It turns out the Sahara Desert, San Diego, Texas,

1:17:40.680 --> 1:17:43.800
 and there's no place like the South Pole or Chile.

1:17:43.800 --> 1:17:46.040
 Those are the two premier places on Earth.

1:17:46.040 --> 1:17:47.700
 Of course, you'd like to go into space.

1:17:47.700 --> 1:17:48.740
 There's no water in space.

1:17:48.740 --> 1:17:51.240
 So it's not about cold.

1:17:51.240 --> 1:17:52.000
 It's about dry.

1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:52.960
 Exactly.

1:17:52.960 --> 1:17:57.760
 So that's why, for example, you can take this vodka,

1:17:57.760 --> 1:17:59.360
 and you could put it in this cup.

1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:01.480
 And we could take it over to a microwave somewhere

1:18:01.480 --> 1:18:03.080
 and heat it up.

1:18:03.080 --> 1:18:05.960
 After two minutes, three minutes, the water's boiling.

1:18:05.960 --> 1:18:06.700
 You can't touch it.

1:18:06.700 --> 1:18:07.240
 Take it from me.

1:18:07.240 --> 1:18:08.040
 Don't touch it.

1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:10.400
 But you can touch the mug and take it out if you want to.

1:18:10.400 --> 1:18:10.900
 Why?

1:18:10.900 --> 1:18:13.000
 Because the mug is totally bone dry.

1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:15.480
 But the microwaves get absorbed by the water molecules

1:18:15.480 --> 1:18:17.480
 because water molecules resonate exactly

1:18:17.480 --> 1:18:19.040
 at these microwave frequencies.

1:18:19.040 --> 1:18:22.800
 So we don't want these precious photons, 420 of them,

1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:26.040
 traveling per cubic centimeter from the Big Bang itself

1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:28.040
 to get absorbed in some water molecule in the Earth's

1:18:28.040 --> 1:18:28.800
 atmosphere.

1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:30.640
 So you take it to a place with the fewest number

1:18:30.640 --> 1:18:34.480
 of water molecules per square centimeter of surface area.

1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:35.960
 And that happens to be either Chile

1:18:35.960 --> 1:18:38.520
 or my other project, the Simons Observatory, is located.

1:18:38.520 --> 1:18:40.720
 Or you take it to the South Pole.

1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:44.760
 We took it to the South Pole and spent a couple of months

1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:46.080
 of my life down there.

1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:49.480
 And it's like being on Hoth.

1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:52.720
 It's a completely otherworldly environment.

1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:55.960
 Ice, planar, flat as a pancake.

1:18:55.960 --> 1:18:59.960
 And the buildings are built up on stilts.

1:18:59.960 --> 1:19:03.400
 They're built because the snow will otherwise cover them over.

1:19:03.400 --> 1:19:06.840
 The nearest medical facilities are 4,000 miles away.

1:19:06.840 --> 1:19:08.960
 If you have any issues with your wisdom teeth,

1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:11.200
 they yank them before you go down there.

1:19:11.200 --> 1:19:12.960
 If you have any issues with your appendix,

1:19:12.960 --> 1:19:15.040
 they'll cut it out of you before you go down there.

1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:17.080
 The Russians at Vostok base, not too far away,

1:19:17.080 --> 1:19:18.960
 about 600 miles away.

1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:20.960
 The doctors there, there's a famous picture of one

1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:24.540
 of them operating on himself, taking out his own appendix

1:19:24.540 --> 1:19:26.480
 in the middle of winter by himself.

1:19:26.480 --> 1:19:27.680
 So harsh conditions.

1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:29.840
 Science in the harshest of conditions.

1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:31.200
 On Earth, at least.

1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:33.040
 And we go to those great lengths because it's

1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:36.520
 a pristine environment to observe these precious photons.

1:19:36.520 --> 1:19:38.200
 And we built this telescope.

1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:40.720
 And it weighs tens of thousands of pounds.

1:19:40.720 --> 1:19:44.680
 And it had to scan the sky almost like it's a robot.

1:19:44.680 --> 1:19:48.440
 I mean, it's scanning the sky almost unattended.

1:19:48.440 --> 1:19:50.920
 We have a guy who spends a year of his life down there,

1:19:50.920 --> 1:19:53.040
 a girl who spends a year of their life down there.

1:19:53.040 --> 1:19:54.360
 They're called winter overs.

1:19:54.360 --> 1:19:56.920
 They arrive in sometimes as early as November.

1:19:56.920 --> 1:19:59.280
 And they don't leave until the following December.

1:19:59.280 --> 1:20:02.760
 And we always joke, we'll pay you $75,000.

1:20:02.760 --> 1:20:04.720
 You just have to work for one night of your life.

1:20:04.720 --> 1:20:05.240
 That's all.

1:20:05.240 --> 1:20:08.020
 But it's a long night.

1:20:08.020 --> 1:20:10.660
 And what BICEP is, and I couldn't

1:20:10.660 --> 1:20:12.640
 bring my polarized sunglasses here,

1:20:12.640 --> 1:20:14.560
 so I brought these actual polarizers here.

1:20:14.560 --> 1:20:17.120
 So if you take this and put it in front of your telescope

1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:21.240
 there, you have now made a polarimeter.

1:20:21.240 --> 1:20:24.180
 You have made a polarization sensitive telescope.

1:20:24.180 --> 1:20:26.400
 Now, you may not be able to immediately know

1:20:26.400 --> 1:20:27.920
 how you would use such a thing.

1:20:27.920 --> 1:20:30.460
 But one way to think about it, now take this guy

1:20:30.460 --> 1:20:33.760
 and look at a light, look at a light source.

1:20:33.760 --> 1:20:34.880
 Put one up to your eye.

1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:37.960
 And now put the other one in front of it anywhere.

1:20:37.960 --> 1:20:40.000
 And now rotate them.

1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:42.480
 What happens to the light source?

1:20:42.480 --> 1:20:45.520
 Becomes brighter and dimmer and brighter and dimmer.

1:20:45.520 --> 1:20:48.200
 Yeah, so it's called a quadrupolar pattern, right?

1:20:48.200 --> 1:20:49.080
 So it's repeating.

1:20:49.080 --> 1:20:51.800
 It goes bright, dim, bright, dim.

1:20:51.800 --> 1:20:55.480
 It rotates twice in intensity for every single physical

1:20:55.480 --> 1:20:56.720
 rotation.

1:20:56.720 --> 1:20:58.720
 And that's because of the property of the photon.

1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:00.560
 The photon is a spin one field.

1:21:00.560 --> 1:21:04.880
 But the polarization of light is the axis

1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:07.320
 at which its electric field is oscillating.

1:21:07.320 --> 1:21:10.560
 Its electric field is marching straight up and straight down.

1:21:10.560 --> 1:21:12.160
 And so therefore, vertical polarization

1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:15.040
 is the same as negative vertical polarization.

1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:17.600
 And so you get the same pattern as you rotate two times

1:21:17.600 --> 1:21:19.240
 for every one physical rotation.

1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:22.800
 This is like a spin two object.

1:21:22.800 --> 1:21:26.320
 So now if you put that in front of the telescope,

1:21:26.320 --> 1:21:27.560
 you can do one of two things.

1:21:27.560 --> 1:21:29.280
 Now you're polarizing all the light that's

1:21:29.280 --> 1:21:31.680
 going in because you have one of the polarizers.

1:21:31.680 --> 1:21:34.120
 And then you can analyze it as you rotate the other one.

1:21:34.120 --> 1:21:37.120
 You can analyze it and change the amount of polarization.

1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:40.040
 Or you can put this kind of very special crystal in here.

1:21:40.040 --> 1:21:40.840
 There's a crystal.

1:21:40.840 --> 1:21:42.240
 It's called calcite.

1:21:42.240 --> 1:21:44.840
 This is from Lex Luthor, not Lex Friedman.

1:21:44.840 --> 1:21:47.560
 This crystal, put it on top of your printed notes

1:21:47.560 --> 1:21:50.840
 there and tell me what does it look like?

1:21:50.840 --> 1:21:56.440
 There's a, like I could see everything twice.

1:21:56.440 --> 1:21:57.280
 It's a double image.

1:21:57.280 --> 1:21:58.440
 It's a double image.

1:21:58.440 --> 1:22:01.080
 That is a special crystal that has two different indices

1:22:01.080 --> 1:22:02.680
 of refraction.

1:22:02.680 --> 1:22:06.120
 So light emerging, which is unpolarized from the black ink,

1:22:06.120 --> 1:22:07.320
 comes out.

1:22:07.320 --> 1:22:09.840
 And it splits into two different directions.

1:22:09.840 --> 1:22:12.560
 And it could split even more if I made the crystal give you

1:22:12.560 --> 1:22:13.720
 my more expensive crystal.

1:22:13.720 --> 1:22:14.360
 But that's all I have.

1:22:14.360 --> 1:22:16.240
 What is the crystal with this kind of property called?

1:22:16.240 --> 1:22:17.360
 It's called calcite.

1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:18.240
 This is crystal.

1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:20.000
 It's called birefringent crystal.

1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:21.160
 Bi means two.

1:22:21.160 --> 1:22:23.440
 Refringent means refracting.

1:22:23.440 --> 1:22:25.480
 So this is a special type of material

1:22:25.480 --> 1:22:28.040
 that separates light based on its polarization.

1:22:28.040 --> 1:22:31.720
 It's a pretty clean bi signal.

1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:35.120
 It's cleanly two.

1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:36.760
 I'm seeing two very cleanly.

1:22:36.760 --> 1:22:37.600
 It's very crisp, right.

1:22:37.600 --> 1:22:40.000
 So that's yours to keep with every time you host me.

1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:43.720
 Now, take the polarizer underneath your left hand.

1:22:43.720 --> 1:22:47.480
 Put it on top of the crystal, and kind of move it back

1:22:47.480 --> 1:22:48.000
 and forth.

1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:49.400
 What's happening?

1:22:49.400 --> 1:22:50.680
 This is incredible.

1:22:50.680 --> 1:22:51.560
 You can switch.

1:22:51.560 --> 1:22:55.760
 As you rotate, you switch from one signal to the other.

1:22:55.760 --> 1:22:58.680
 So it's one of the refractions to the other.

1:22:58.680 --> 1:22:59.200
 Whoa.

1:22:59.200 --> 1:23:02.920
 So that is now you are analyzing the polarization.

1:23:02.920 --> 1:23:05.200
 You're confirming the light comes out of the crystal.

1:23:05.200 --> 1:23:07.200
 Two different types of polarization.

1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:11.080
 And effectively, what we do is we have those two things,

1:23:11.080 --> 1:23:12.040
 if you like.

1:23:12.040 --> 1:23:14.800
 But working in the microwave, so that's

1:23:14.800 --> 1:23:16.720
 where the cosmic photons are brightest,

1:23:16.720 --> 1:23:19.920
 in the microwave regime in the electromagnetic spectrum.

1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:22.000
 And we're coupling that to a refracting telescope.

1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:23.720
 But your eyes are refracting telescopes.

1:23:23.720 --> 1:23:25.520
 So you are a polarimeter right now.

1:23:25.520 --> 1:23:29.160
 The human eye can actually slightly detect polarization.

1:23:29.160 --> 1:23:31.840
 But otherwise, it mainly detects its intensity of light

1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:32.440
 and the color.

1:23:32.440 --> 1:23:34.960
 That's what we call color and intensity, brightness.

1:23:34.960 --> 1:23:37.160
 So you're devising an instrument that's

1:23:37.160 --> 1:23:38.840
 very precisely measuring that polarization.

1:23:38.840 --> 1:23:39.920
 Exactly.

1:23:39.920 --> 1:23:42.680
 And doing so in the microwave region with detectors

1:23:42.680 --> 1:23:46.080
 not made of biological human retina cells,

1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:49.840
 but of superconductors and things called bolometers.

1:23:49.840 --> 1:23:52.360
 And this has to be done at temperatures

1:23:52.360 --> 1:23:55.120
 close to absolute zero under vacuum conditions

1:23:55.120 --> 1:23:58.640
 one billionth of the pressure we feel here at sea level.

1:23:58.640 --> 1:24:01.320
 So why is it that this kind of device

1:24:01.320 --> 1:24:03.160
 could win a Nobel Prize?

1:24:03.160 --> 1:24:05.920
 So when the CMB was discovered, it

1:24:05.920 --> 1:24:07.360
 was discovered serendipitously.

1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:11.560
 There were two radio astronomers working at the time

1:24:11.560 --> 1:24:13.040
 at Bell Laboratories.

1:24:13.040 --> 1:24:14.600
 Now, why would Bell Laboratories be

1:24:14.600 --> 1:24:16.120
 employing radio astronomers?

1:24:16.120 --> 1:24:19.560
 Bell Laboratories was kind of like Apple,

1:24:19.560 --> 1:24:21.920
 or it was like a think tank, or it was Google.

1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:23.080
 Let's say it was like Google.

1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:26.760
 Google has Google X. It has this thing and that thing, right?

1:24:26.760 --> 1:24:28.680
 So they were working there.

1:24:28.680 --> 1:24:31.480
 But imagine if Google was employing radio astronomers.

1:24:31.480 --> 1:24:32.920
 They were actively recruiting them.

1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:33.920
 Why would they do that?

1:24:33.920 --> 1:24:36.480
 Well, it turns out that was the beginning in the 1960s,

1:24:36.480 --> 1:24:39.160
 was the first commercial satellite

1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:41.040
 launch for communication.

1:24:41.040 --> 1:24:44.400
 And so Bell Labs, which would later become the telephone

1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:47.280
 part of AT&T, the early telephone company,

1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:50.520
 later invent the first cell phone the year I was born.

1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:53.200
 And they would take that, 1946, and they

1:24:53.200 --> 1:24:56.000
 would take that telescope technology

1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:58.520
 that radio astronomers had developed,

1:24:58.520 --> 1:25:00.560
 and they would use that to see if they

1:25:00.560 --> 1:25:02.680
 could improve the signal to noise of the satellites

1:25:02.680 --> 1:25:03.600
 that they were seeing.

1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:05.040
 And they found they couldn't.

1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:07.360
 They found that they could not improve the signal to noise

1:25:07.360 --> 1:25:10.160
 ratio of the first telecommunication satellite.

1:25:10.160 --> 1:25:13.280
 It was like the equivalent to one kilobit per second modem.

1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:16.440
 They were bouncing signals from the West Coast

1:25:16.440 --> 1:25:18.320
 up to the satellite, bouncing it down,

1:25:18.320 --> 1:25:21.360
 landing it in New Jersey, of all places,

1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:25.160
 in northern New Jersey, Holmdell, New Jersey.

1:25:25.160 --> 1:25:27.480
 And these radio astronomers couldn't get rid of the signal.

1:25:27.480 --> 1:25:30.200
 So they said, well, New Jersey's not far from New York.

1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:31.600
 Let's see if the signal's coming from New York.

1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:33.040
 No, not coming from New York.

1:25:33.040 --> 1:25:34.280
 Let's see if it changes with the year.

1:25:34.280 --> 1:25:35.400
 Maybe it's coming from the galaxy,

1:25:35.400 --> 1:25:38.680
 which was also discovered there by Jansky in 1930 something.

1:25:38.680 --> 1:25:41.480
 So in not being able to reduce the signal

1:25:41.480 --> 1:25:45.120
 or increase the signal to noise ratio, the noise was not good.

1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:46.720
 They knew the signal was right.

1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:48.120
 They couldn't get rid of the noise.

1:25:48.120 --> 1:25:50.040
 And there was excess noise over the model that

1:25:50.040 --> 1:25:52.080
 had not only been predicted by them,

1:25:52.080 --> 1:25:54.080
 but had been measured by a previous guy, a guy

1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:55.760
 by the name of Edward Ohm.

1:25:55.760 --> 1:25:57.680
 He measured the same signal, found

1:25:57.680 --> 1:26:00.320
 that there was this hiss of static, of radio static

1:26:00.320 --> 1:26:02.000
 that he could not get rid of, that had

1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:04.000
 a value of about 3 Kelvin.

1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:04.800
 So you can translate.

1:26:04.800 --> 1:26:07.520
 Remember I said, if you take a radio telescope

1:26:07.520 --> 1:26:10.560
 and you point it at an object that's hot,

1:26:10.560 --> 1:26:12.040
 the radio telescope's detector will

1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:14.120
 get to the same temperature as the object.

1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:16.120
 It's a principle of radio thermodynamics.

1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:17.480
 So it's a really interesting thing.

1:26:17.480 --> 1:26:18.320
 It's a thermometer.

1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:20.320
 You can stick it into Jupiter from here on Earth.

1:26:20.320 --> 1:26:21.520
 It's amazing.

1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:24.560
 And so we in radio astronomy characterize our signal

1:26:24.560 --> 1:26:27.640
 not by its intensity, but by its temperature.

1:26:27.640 --> 1:26:29.960
 So he found, this guy Edward Ohm, oh, there's

1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:31.120
 this 3 Kelvin signal.

1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:32.280
 I can't get rid of it.

1:26:32.280 --> 1:26:35.000
 It must be I did my error analysis wrong.

1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.720
 And I would give him an F if he was one of my first year

1:26:37.720 --> 1:26:38.840
 students.

1:26:38.840 --> 1:26:41.560
 But he's just attributed to lack of understanding.

1:26:41.560 --> 1:26:43.800
 These other guys, Penzias and Wilson,

1:26:43.800 --> 1:26:46.320
 who are also radio astronomers, they said, no,

1:26:46.320 --> 1:26:49.280
 let's build another experiment, put that inside

1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:53.000
 of our telescope, and do what's called calibration.

1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:56.800
 Inject a known source of signal every second that

1:26:56.800 --> 1:26:58.760
 has a temperature of about 4 Kelvin,

1:26:58.760 --> 1:27:00.300
 because the signal they're trying to get rid of

1:27:00.300 --> 1:27:01.480
 is about 3 Kelvin.

1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:02.920
 And you want to have it as close as possible

1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:04.840
 to the pernicious signal as possible.

1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:06.320
 They did that once a second.

1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:07.560
 So they got billions of measurements,

1:27:07.560 --> 1:27:08.840
 millions of measurements over the course

1:27:08.840 --> 1:27:11.280
 of several months, years, and even,

1:27:11.280 --> 1:27:13.040
 by the end of, you know, millions of measurements

1:27:13.040 --> 1:27:14.520
 for sure.

1:27:14.520 --> 1:27:16.320
 And they found they couldn't get rid of it either,

1:27:16.320 --> 1:27:20.400
 but they measured it was exactly 2.7265 degrees Kelvin.

1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:24.480
 So how does having a 4 Kelvin source,

1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:26.560
 how does the calibration work, just out of curiosity?

1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:27.400
 It could be larger.

1:27:27.400 --> 1:27:29.120
 Imagine like you're trying to calibrate the microphone.

1:27:29.120 --> 1:27:31.260
 Like you could do it with like a really loud sound,

1:27:31.260 --> 1:27:33.560
 but the gain would start to compress.

1:27:33.560 --> 1:27:36.000
 So there are amplifiers downstream from the detector

1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:38.640
 in every experiment that I've ever worked on.

1:27:38.640 --> 1:27:41.400
 And they only have a linear region over a very small region.

1:27:41.400 --> 1:27:43.360
 And you want to keep it as linear as possible.

1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:45.160
 That means you want, if you're trying to get rid of it,

1:27:45.160 --> 1:27:47.080
 you're trying to compare like a voice,

1:27:47.080 --> 1:27:49.600
 and you're trying to compare that to a jet engine,

1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:52.520
 it's not going to be as easy on the amplifiers

1:27:52.520 --> 1:27:55.960
 as getting a slightly loud gong or something, you know.

1:27:55.960 --> 1:27:59.160
 So the idea of the noise is present in both?

1:27:59.160 --> 1:28:00.400
 There's noise present in both.

1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:02.320
 And you measure, what they did is

1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:03.880
 they made a separate measurement just

1:28:03.880 --> 1:28:06.200
 of the calibration system, which they measured

1:28:06.200 --> 1:28:07.160
 exactly very well.

1:28:07.160 --> 1:28:09.320
 4 Kelvin is the temperature of a liquid helium.

1:28:09.320 --> 1:28:11.480
 That's a temperature that's not going to change.

1:28:11.480 --> 1:28:12.360
 And it's certainly not going to change

1:28:12.360 --> 1:28:14.160
 over a time scale of one second.

1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:16.080
 And so they could compare unknown signal,

1:28:16.080 --> 1:28:17.760
 known signal, unknown signal, known signal,

1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:18.960
 like a scale, like a balance.

1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:20.360
 So another way to think about it is like this.

1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:22.520
 You've seen these Libra kind of balances,

1:28:22.520 --> 1:28:24.400
 where you put two weights in a pan, right?

1:28:24.400 --> 1:28:27.040
 What happens if you put like a one ounce weight on one side

1:28:27.040 --> 1:28:28.440
 and a 20 kilogram weight in the other?

1:28:28.440 --> 1:28:30.200
 You don't get any measurement, right?

1:28:30.200 --> 1:28:32.320
 You do get kind of a measurement if they're close in weight.

1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:33.760
 That's why they use 4 Kelvin.

1:28:33.760 --> 1:28:36.400
 Got it, but just to linger on the fact

1:28:36.400 --> 1:28:38.240
 that there's a romantic element to the fact

1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:41.200
 that you're arriving at the same temperature.

1:28:41.200 --> 1:28:42.040
 That's kind of fascinating.

1:28:42.040 --> 1:28:43.640
 And you measuring stuff in terms of,

1:28:43.640 --> 1:28:45.640
 you're measuring signal in terms of temperature

1:28:45.640 --> 1:28:46.840
 at the source.

1:28:46.840 --> 1:28:47.680
 Yeah.

1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:49.440
 So you get to, I mean, there's something

1:28:49.440 --> 1:28:51.220
 about temperature that's intimate.

1:28:51.220 --> 1:28:52.060
 Yeah.

1:28:52.060 --> 1:28:52.880
 It's cool.

1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:55.120
 Yeah, especially since, you know, all life

1:28:55.120 --> 1:28:57.560
 is basically, you know, conversion of energy

1:28:57.560 --> 1:28:58.920
 and trying to control entropy,

1:28:58.920 --> 1:29:01.160
 which is then related to thermodynamics

1:29:01.160 --> 1:29:02.600
 exactly in that way.

1:29:02.600 --> 1:29:06.680
 And this is very crucial kind of thing to do in science

1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:08.640
 because they weren't looking for the signal.

1:29:08.640 --> 1:29:10.180
 They found it accidentally,

1:29:10.180 --> 1:29:12.720
 these two scientists, Penzias and Wilson.

1:29:12.720 --> 1:29:15.160
 And I like to think that those kinds of discoveries

1:29:15.160 --> 1:29:16.540
 are the purest in science.

1:29:16.540 --> 1:29:19.080
 Like when you see something, Isaac Asimov once said,

1:29:19.080 --> 1:29:22.260
 like the most important reaction as a scientist is not,

1:29:22.260 --> 1:29:26.440
 Eureka, which means in Greek, as you know, I have found it.

1:29:26.440 --> 1:29:29.060
 No, he said, no, he said like, that's weird.

1:29:29.060 --> 1:29:30.720
 Like that's a much better reaction

1:29:30.720 --> 1:29:31.880
 or that's freaking cool.

1:29:31.880 --> 1:29:34.760
 Like that's a scientist, not like, oh, I found one.

1:29:34.760 --> 1:29:35.580
 Because.

1:29:35.580 --> 1:29:36.420
 Surprise.

1:29:36.420 --> 1:29:37.240
 Yeah.

1:29:37.240 --> 1:29:38.080
 Yeah.

1:29:38.080 --> 1:29:38.920
 Because if you find what you're gonna find,

1:29:38.920 --> 1:29:43.000
 that's what leads us susceptible to confirmation bias,

1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:44.720
 which is deadly inside, you know,

1:29:44.720 --> 1:29:46.240
 as close to deadly as possible.

1:29:46.240 --> 1:29:47.960
 So how does that take us to something

1:29:47.960 --> 1:29:51.120
 that's potentially worthy of a Nobel Prize?

1:29:51.120 --> 1:29:54.240
 So Penzias and Wilson weren't looking for a signal.

1:29:54.240 --> 1:29:56.500
 They ended up discovering the heat leftover

1:29:56.500 --> 1:30:01.500
 from the fusion of helium from hydrogen, et cetera.

1:30:01.640 --> 1:30:03.040
 And that was a serendipitous discovery.

1:30:03.040 --> 1:30:04.800
 They won the Nobel Prize in 1978.

1:30:04.800 --> 1:30:07.640
 It was the first one ever awarded in cosmology.

1:30:07.640 --> 1:30:09.860
 My reasoning is, what if you could explain

1:30:09.860 --> 1:30:11.720
 not only how the elements got formed,

1:30:11.720 --> 1:30:13.820
 but how the whole universe got formed

1:30:13.820 --> 1:30:16.680
 and kill off every other model of science.

1:30:16.680 --> 1:30:19.760
 So if that weren't enough, every scientist, you know,

1:30:19.760 --> 1:30:23.440
 worth his or her salt had told me and Andrew Lang

1:30:23.440 --> 1:30:26.480
 and our colleagues, this is a slam dunk Nobel Prize,

1:30:26.480 --> 1:30:27.820
 if you could do it.

1:30:27.820 --> 1:30:29.820
 Because it was really explaining, again,

1:30:29.820 --> 1:30:31.600
 the stakes of this science is different

1:30:31.600 --> 1:30:33.900
 than like super fluidity, plasma physics.

1:30:33.900 --> 1:30:36.440
 When you talk about the origin of the universe,

1:30:36.440 --> 1:30:37.880
 it ties into everything.

1:30:37.880 --> 1:30:41.860
 It ties into philosophy, theology.

1:30:41.860 --> 1:30:45.480
 You realize if Paul Steinhardt is correct,

1:30:45.480 --> 1:30:47.280
 that the Bible can't be correct.

1:30:47.280 --> 1:30:49.360
 In other words, where the Bible is correct now

1:30:49.360 --> 1:30:52.120
 isn't falsified, if you like, if you believe it.

1:30:52.120 --> 1:30:54.800
 I never use the Bible as a science book, obviously.

1:30:54.800 --> 1:30:57.820
 But the Bible speaks of a singular beginning.

1:30:57.820 --> 1:31:00.600
 What if you knew for sure the universe was not singular?

1:31:00.600 --> 1:31:03.480
 It would be more like the cosmology of Akhenaten

1:31:03.480 --> 1:31:07.120
 and Egyptians than the biblical Torah, Old Testament,

1:31:07.120 --> 1:31:08.720
 if you will, narrative.

1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:11.400
 So in my mind, the stakes could not be higher.

1:31:11.400 --> 1:31:14.140
 And again, it's not an offense, because we need plasma physics.

1:31:14.140 --> 1:31:17.560
 We need every type of physics except maybe biophysics.

1:31:17.560 --> 1:31:20.320
 We literally use every branch of physics, thermodynamics,

1:31:20.320 --> 1:31:22.200
 superconductivity, quantum mechanics,

1:31:22.200 --> 1:31:24.260
 all that goes into our understanding

1:31:24.260 --> 1:31:25.000
 of the instrument.

1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:27.800
 And even further, if you want to understand the theory that

1:31:27.800 --> 1:31:29.760
 predicts the signal that we purport to measure.

1:31:29.760 --> 1:31:34.040
 So I rationalize that if Penzias and Wilson won the Nobel

1:31:34.040 --> 1:31:37.220
 Prize for this, if Hulse and Taylor won the Nobel

1:31:37.220 --> 1:31:39.760
 Prize for indirectly detecting gravitational waves,

1:31:39.760 --> 1:31:43.500
 this is decades before LIGO, by me detecting

1:31:43.500 --> 1:31:46.880
 gravitational waves indirectly, detecting how the universe

1:31:46.880 --> 1:31:50.840
 began, detecting the origin of the initial conditions

1:31:50.840 --> 1:31:52.720
 for the Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which

1:31:52.720 --> 1:31:55.080
 won the Nobel Prize in 1983.

1:31:55.080 --> 1:31:57.920
 These are like five Nobel Prizes potentially.

1:31:57.920 --> 1:32:00.200
 For that reason, it seemed as close

1:32:00.200 --> 1:32:02.440
 as you could possibly get to being a slam dunk,

1:32:02.440 --> 1:32:06.160
 to outdo what my father did, to do really this impossible.

1:32:06.160 --> 1:32:10.720
 And at that time, Lex, again, it sounds weird.

1:32:10.720 --> 1:32:15.920
 Because people are like, oh, you still want the Nobel Prize.

1:32:15.920 --> 1:32:16.880
 You're still like greedy.

1:32:16.880 --> 1:32:19.120
 And look, you wrote another book about it.

1:32:19.120 --> 1:32:19.720
 And I always joke.

1:32:19.720 --> 1:32:21.360
 I'm like, well, if you want to see if I'm a hypocrite,

1:32:21.360 --> 1:32:23.880
 just get them to give me the Nobel Prize in literature.

1:32:23.880 --> 1:32:26.560
 And if I accept it, then I'm a hypocrite.

1:32:26.560 --> 1:32:29.200
 Oh, wait, well, we'll get to your current feelings

1:32:29.200 --> 1:32:33.040
 on the Nobel Prize in terms of hypocrite and so on.

1:32:33.040 --> 1:32:35.560
 So there's this ambition.

1:32:35.560 --> 1:32:38.880
 Let's say this device, this kind of signal

1:32:38.880 --> 1:32:40.560
 could unlock many of the mysteries

1:32:40.560 --> 1:32:42.240
 about the early universe.

1:32:42.240 --> 1:32:44.240
 And so there's excitement there.

1:32:44.240 --> 1:32:47.040
 So let's take it then further.

1:32:47.040 --> 1:32:50.240
 I mean, there's a human story here of a bit of heartbreak.

1:32:50.240 --> 1:32:54.560
 Not only was this possibly worth a Nobel Prize,

1:32:54.560 --> 1:32:57.200
 if the Nobel Prize was given,

1:32:57.200 --> 1:32:59.680
 you were excluded from the list of three

1:32:59.680 --> 1:33:01.520
 that would get the Nobel Prize.

1:33:01.520 --> 1:33:04.520
 So why were you excluded?

1:33:04.520 --> 1:33:07.600
 Maybe that's a place to tell the story of Bicep 2.

1:33:07.600 --> 1:33:10.200
 Yeah, so Bicep 2, like iPhones,

1:33:10.200 --> 1:33:12.040
 or I know you're an Android fanboy,

1:33:12.040 --> 1:33:14.480
 but every year, they get a little bit better.

1:33:14.480 --> 1:33:15.680
 They get more megapixels.

1:33:15.680 --> 1:33:19.680
 They get more optics, triple X zoom, whatever, OK?

1:33:19.680 --> 1:33:21.520
 We upgraded our detectors as well.

1:33:21.520 --> 1:33:23.560
 The initial detectors were based on what

1:33:23.560 --> 1:33:24.880
 are called semiconductors.

1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:26.800
 They have certain properties that

1:33:26.800 --> 1:33:29.320
 make them very difficult to replicate at scale.

1:33:29.320 --> 1:33:32.120
 And we wanted to make them into superconductors, which

1:33:32.120 --> 1:33:35.360
 had a virtue that you could then mass produce them.

1:33:35.360 --> 1:33:36.680
 Why superconductors?

1:33:36.680 --> 1:33:38.320
 Well, again, we're measuring heat.

1:33:38.320 --> 1:33:40.240
 So one thing about a superconductor

1:33:40.240 --> 1:33:43.360
 is that it transitions from some finite resistance

1:33:43.360 --> 1:33:47.560
 to zero resistance over a very short span of temperature

1:33:47.560 --> 1:33:48.400
 range.

1:33:48.400 --> 1:33:51.360
 That means you can use that very short span dependency

1:33:51.360 --> 1:33:54.920
 as an accurate and sensitive and precise thermometer.

1:33:54.920 --> 1:33:56.960
 And so my brilliant colleagues around the world,

1:33:56.960 --> 1:33:59.360
 in this case, Jamie Bok, and nowadays, Suzanne Staggs

1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:02.560
 at Princeton, they are just exquisitely

1:34:02.560 --> 1:34:05.840
 making these sensors, tens of thousands of them.

1:34:05.840 --> 1:34:07.960
 The initial Bicep 1 instrument, of course,

1:34:07.960 --> 1:34:12.240
 we just call the Bicep, that only had 98 detectors.

1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:15.880
 Simon's Observatory is going to have 100 times more just

1:34:15.880 --> 1:34:17.800
 in one of our four telescopes.

1:34:17.800 --> 1:34:20.840
 We're going to have 60,000 detectors operating

1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:24.520
 full time at 0.1 degree above absolute zero

1:34:24.520 --> 1:34:25.600
 in the Atacama Desert.

1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:26.440
 We'll get there.

1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:30.200
 But in the case of getting back to what Bicep did,

1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:32.600
 we upgraded and made Bicep 2.

1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:37.920
 In January 2010, we had just installed

1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:42.320
 in the exact same location at the South Pole,

1:34:42.320 --> 1:34:45.040
 in the same building, which is ominously called the Dark

1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:49.840
 Sector Laboratory, DSL, still operating to this very day,

1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:54.160
 we installed a new receiver on the same platform as before.

1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:57.600
 It had very similar identical optics, cryogenics, vacuum,

1:34:57.600 --> 1:35:02.040
 everything, except it went from 98 detectors to 512 detectors.

1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:05.440
 So almost an order of magnitude, very substantial upgrade.

1:35:05.440 --> 1:35:06.840
 And it had certain other features

1:35:06.840 --> 1:35:11.040
 that made it even more powerful than just a naive factor of 5.

1:35:11.040 --> 1:35:12.680
 And then we started observing with that.

1:35:12.680 --> 1:35:14.120
 And we knew we'd have years to go,

1:35:14.120 --> 1:35:15.320
 and maybe we'd never see anything.

1:35:15.320 --> 1:35:17.560
 Again, we're looking for these tiny little reverberations

1:35:17.560 --> 1:35:19.200
 in the fabric of space time produced

1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:21.720
 close to the origin of the universe as we could ever

1:35:21.720 --> 1:35:23.000
 get to.

1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:24.360
 So I was playing a role in that.

1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:28.200
 Obviously, it had upgraded my version of the original idea

1:35:28.200 --> 1:35:32.480
 that I had had for BICEP along with Andrew Lang.

1:35:32.480 --> 1:35:37.040
 And in January of 2010, I was at a meeting at UC Berkeley,

1:35:37.040 --> 1:35:39.120
 and I got a call from Andrew Lang's,

1:35:39.120 --> 1:35:41.760
 or I was in a meeting with Andrew Lang's thesis advisor,

1:35:41.760 --> 1:35:43.960
 Paul Richards at UC Berkeley.

1:35:43.960 --> 1:35:45.880
 And he said that Andrew was dead.

1:35:45.880 --> 1:35:48.920
 He had taken his life by suicide.

1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:51.520
 And this is a man, and I had already lost my father

1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:54.880
 at this point in 2010, but he was like a father figure

1:35:54.880 --> 1:35:55.760
 to me, Andrew.

1:35:55.760 --> 1:35:58.600
 He would give me advice on marriage,

1:35:58.600 --> 1:36:02.140
 on how I should be with my kids, and what

1:36:02.140 --> 1:36:03.640
 was the most important way to move

1:36:03.640 --> 1:36:04.800
 through the academic ladder.

1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:08.560
 Again, he was predinaturally suited to win the Nobel Prize.

1:36:08.560 --> 1:36:10.800
 Everyone always thought he would win it.

1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:12.600
 If he were alive, he still could win it.

1:36:12.600 --> 1:36:14.280
 In fact, his wife, or his ex wife,

1:36:14.280 --> 1:36:17.760
 won it, Frances Arnold, in 2018.

1:36:17.760 --> 1:36:22.880
 And it was this power couple, and it destroyed me

1:36:22.880 --> 1:36:27.440
 for a long time, because he was just this magical person.

1:36:27.440 --> 1:36:31.360
 I mean, I couldn't conceive of my career, my life,

1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:35.280
 even these aspects of raising kids and being married

1:36:35.280 --> 1:36:37.020
 without him.

1:36:37.020 --> 1:36:40.880
 And to do it in that way, it felt like, again,

1:36:40.880 --> 1:36:44.160
 he's got kids, and I feel terrible for them, obviously.

1:36:44.160 --> 1:36:45.480
 But it did feel like a betrayal.

1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:47.160
 I mean, I'm just being honest with you.

1:36:47.160 --> 1:36:50.240
 It felt like, why the f did you not reach out?

1:36:50.240 --> 1:36:52.720
 I thought we were close, and I couldn't.

1:36:52.720 --> 1:36:54.240
 I told him everything, and I felt

1:36:54.240 --> 1:36:56.400
 like he had told me everything.

1:36:56.400 --> 1:36:57.480
 And now he was gone.

1:36:57.480 --> 1:36:59.940
 And then, inevitably, we had to keep running the instrument.

1:36:59.940 --> 1:37:01.900
 I mean, there's millions of dollars invested,

1:37:01.900 --> 1:37:05.720
 careers at stake, young people working tremendously hard.

1:37:05.720 --> 1:37:06.640
 And then here we were.

1:37:06.640 --> 1:37:08.320
 And who's going to take over the lead?

1:37:08.320 --> 1:37:10.920
 He was the lead of the project at Caltech.

1:37:10.920 --> 1:37:14.140
 And then it turned out that the other collaborators,

1:37:14.140 --> 1:37:16.640
 with whom I had been working for years and shared a lot of ups

1:37:16.640 --> 1:37:19.820
 and downs with as well, they had decided

1:37:19.820 --> 1:37:21.960
 to form a collaboration in which I was no longer

1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:23.480
 the principal investigator.

1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:25.560
 I was no longer one of the co principal investigators,

1:37:25.560 --> 1:37:26.920
 as I was on Bicep 1.

1:37:26.920 --> 1:37:29.560
 So I continued on Bicep 1 as the co leader of it,

1:37:29.560 --> 1:37:31.040
 but not on Bicep 2.

1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:34.600
 And obviously, that was pretty painful.

1:37:34.600 --> 1:37:36.280
 This is all happening at the same time

1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:40.360
 as you lose this father figure.

1:37:40.360 --> 1:37:45.200
 Now there's this one betrayal in a way,

1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:47.400
 and then there's another, or something

1:37:47.400 --> 1:37:48.800
 that feels like a betrayal.

1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:51.840
 Yeah, and he had been the only one

1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:54.800
 looking out for my interest in the new experiment.

1:37:54.800 --> 1:37:57.480
 I had moved from Caltech to UC San Diego,

1:37:57.480 --> 1:37:59.200
 and there were other postdocs in the mix,

1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:01.240
 all of whom had come there to work with him

1:38:01.240 --> 1:38:03.740
 to get the approbation that would then lead

1:38:03.740 --> 1:38:06.800
 to their careers taking off, as it did for mine.

1:38:06.800 --> 1:38:09.160
 And so there was a competition.

1:38:09.160 --> 1:38:13.320
 Science is not free from egos and competition

1:38:13.320 --> 1:38:15.880
 and desires, rightfully or wrongfully,

1:38:15.880 --> 1:38:17.480
 for credit and attribution.

1:38:17.480 --> 1:38:20.040
 Was he the source of strength and confidence

1:38:20.040 --> 1:38:22.040
 for you as a scientist, as a man?

1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:26.280
 I mean, we're kind of alone in this world.

1:38:26.280 --> 1:38:28.480
 When you take on difficult things,

1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:31.760
 we often kind of grasp at a few folks

1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:33.280
 that give us strength.

1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:34.120
 Yeah.

1:38:34.120 --> 1:38:37.320
 Was he basically your only source of strength

1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:39.320
 in this whole journey, like primarily

1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:41.840
 in terms of this close knit?

1:38:41.840 --> 1:38:43.600
 As a scientist, there were really two.

1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:46.080
 There was one, this Russian cosmologist,

1:38:46.080 --> 1:38:48.520
 Alexander Polnareff, who thankfully is very much alive.

1:38:48.520 --> 1:38:51.080
 He was at Queen Mary University.

1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:52.560
 Now he's retired.

1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:56.040
 He was kind of a theoretical, cosmological father to me.

1:38:56.040 --> 1:38:58.760
 And then Andrew was this counterpoint

1:38:58.760 --> 1:39:02.600
 that was teaching me, you need to have a brand as a scientist.

1:39:02.600 --> 1:39:04.040
 Every scientist has a brand.

1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:05.640
 And some of them don't protect it.

1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:07.880
 Some of them don't burnish it.

1:39:07.880 --> 1:39:10.000
 But some of the skills about being a scientist

1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:12.360
 we don't teach our students involve,

1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:16.800
 how do you cultivate a scientific persona?

1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:18.760
 And he was the exemplar for that,

1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:22.520
 in addition to being the avuncular father figure type

1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:26.480
 character that really was the person I would talk to.

1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:29.080
 I had issues with when I had issues with my own students.

1:39:29.080 --> 1:39:30.640
 And he would tell me how those were.

1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:34.480
 And he would tell me his misgivings about people

1:39:34.480 --> 1:39:36.600
 that he worked with or things in his personal life.

1:39:36.600 --> 1:39:39.160
 And it was devastating.

1:39:39.160 --> 1:39:40.680
 But again, who the hell am I?

1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:42.280
 I'm not his kid.

1:39:42.280 --> 1:39:44.440
 His kid's lost father.

1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:46.760
 So I feel guilty talking about it in that sense,

1:39:46.760 --> 1:39:48.480
 but it's just a reality.

1:39:48.480 --> 1:39:50.640
 Well, there is something that's not often talked about

1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:55.040
 is people who collaborate on scientific efforts.

1:39:55.040 --> 1:39:58.680
 I mean, that's, I don't, again, don't wanna compare,

1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:03.520
 but sometimes when the collaborations are truly great,

1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:08.520
 it sounds similar as when veterans talk about

1:40:09.200 --> 1:40:11.360
 their time serving together.

1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:12.920
 There's a bond that's formed.

1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:15.960
 So like comparing family and this kind of thing is,

1:40:15.960 --> 1:40:19.920
 you know, it's not productive,

1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:23.920
 but the depth of the bond is nevertheless real

1:40:25.760 --> 1:40:28.200
 because you're taking on something,

1:40:28.200 --> 1:40:29.800
 you're taking on the impossible.

1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:32.520
 You're trying to achieve something,

1:40:32.520 --> 1:40:33.960
 sort of like there's this darkness,

1:40:33.960 --> 1:40:37.640
 this fog of mystery that we're all surrounded by,

1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:40.480
 which is what the human condition is.

1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:42.880
 And you are like grasping at hope

1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:44.720
 through the tools of science.

1:40:44.720 --> 1:40:46.480
 And you're doing that together

1:40:46.480 --> 1:40:50.080
 with like a confidence you probably should not have,

1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:51.520
 but you're boldly pushing through.

1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:56.520
 And then for him to take his own life,

1:40:57.640 --> 1:41:02.640
 can I ask you about this kind of moment that combined,

1:41:02.880 --> 1:41:03.920
 I don't wanna say betrayal,

1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:05.920
 but perhaps the feeling of betrayal

1:41:05.920 --> 1:41:09.360
 that Bicep 2 kind of goes on without you,

1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:11.600
 even though you're part of it,

1:41:11.600 --> 1:41:13.560
 you're not part of the leadership group.

1:41:15.640 --> 1:41:17.280
 Can you describe those low points?

1:41:18.640 --> 1:41:19.840
 Was there a depression?

1:41:19.840 --> 1:41:23.000
 Or was there a crumbling of confidence?

1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:26.280
 Yeah, I mean, it was so wrapped up

1:41:26.280 --> 1:41:28.960
 with my identity as a person.

1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:31.200
 You know, like there's only a few different ways

1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:34.800
 to have identity unless you're unhealthy psychologically.

1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:37.120
 One of them for scientists is often that they're a scientist

1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:39.160
 and that sometimes is their primary identity.

1:41:39.160 --> 1:41:41.920
 Now I've got other husband and father,

1:41:41.920 --> 1:41:44.840
 but at that time that was my identity.

1:41:44.840 --> 1:41:47.440
 So to have that kind of taken away,

1:41:48.440 --> 1:41:52.960
 you know what, it reminded me of being kind of adopted

1:41:52.960 --> 1:41:55.840
 in a sense like the one who created me

1:41:55.840 --> 1:41:58.360
 or that I had played a role in my life,

1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:00.800
 that he abandoned me in the sense,

1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:02.640
 it felt like these people are abandoning me.

1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:04.320
 And the only thing I'd correct about the analogy

1:42:04.320 --> 1:42:07.080
 that you use is like in the war,

1:42:07.080 --> 1:42:08.680
 they're all working for common good.

1:42:08.680 --> 1:42:11.640
 It's not like I want to get the most kills.

1:42:11.640 --> 1:42:13.400
 I compare it more to like a band,

1:42:13.400 --> 1:42:16.440
 like think about the Beatles and what they did.

1:42:16.440 --> 1:42:20.160
 And then they ripped apart because of egos, credit,

1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:21.240
 they had solo careers,

1:42:21.240 --> 1:42:25.360
 they had relations with their intimates and so forth.

1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:27.840
 And there it's not only for the common good,

1:42:27.840 --> 1:42:30.200
 there is more of a zero sum aspect.

1:42:30.200 --> 1:42:33.960
 Like I would say, science is an infinite game.

1:42:33.960 --> 1:42:35.840
 You can't win science.

1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:37.440
 You never get to the, oh, we won science.

1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:38.920
 And even the Nobel prize, they don't feel like,

1:42:38.920 --> 1:42:39.760
 oh, we're done.

1:42:39.760 --> 1:42:41.360
 They feel like a lot of times they're imposters

1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:43.000
 even to that day.

1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:47.920
 However, science is made up of a lot of finite games

1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:50.000
 where there is only one winner for tenure.

1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:51.280
 There is only three winners

1:42:51.280 --> 1:42:53.880
 or only three winners for the Nobel prize.

1:42:53.880 --> 1:42:56.040
 And because of that, I think it's heterodox

1:42:56.040 --> 1:42:59.200
 and it's very confusing, especially there's no guide.

1:42:59.200 --> 1:43:00.800
 I never got a guide how to be a professor,

1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:02.560
 how to teach, how to lead a research group,

1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:05.040
 how to deal with the death of an advisor,

1:43:05.040 --> 1:43:08.520
 how to deal with an unruly graduate student or two.

1:43:08.520 --> 1:43:09.960
 So we're all like reinventing it,

1:43:09.960 --> 1:43:12.440
 which is kind of ironic and insane if you think about it.

1:43:12.440 --> 1:43:14.360
 Cause the academic system that I am a part of

1:43:14.360 --> 1:43:16.880
 and you are a part of is a thousand years old.

1:43:16.880 --> 1:43:21.720
 Dates back to Bologna, Northern Italy, 1088 or so.

1:43:21.720 --> 1:43:24.240
 First universities were established.

1:43:24.240 --> 1:43:26.560
 And very little has changed.

1:43:26.560 --> 1:43:28.920
 There's some guy or gal scratching a rock

1:43:28.920 --> 1:43:31.960
 on another piece of rock and lecturing in front.

1:43:31.960 --> 1:43:33.860
 And there's only one better aspect nowadays

1:43:33.860 --> 1:43:36.920
 is that back then the students could go on strike

1:43:36.920 --> 1:43:38.300
 if they didn't like the professor

1:43:38.300 --> 1:43:39.960
 and then he or she wouldn't get paid.

1:43:39.960 --> 1:43:42.200
 Probably mostly it was he's back then.

1:43:42.200 --> 1:43:44.440
 Nowadays that barbaric process has been replaced

1:43:44.440 --> 1:43:45.880
 by tenure, so okay.

1:43:47.200 --> 1:43:50.120
 But no, it was a definite kind of feeling of the rug

1:43:50.120 --> 1:43:52.120
 getting pulled out from underneath me

1:43:52.120 --> 1:43:55.440
 because he was like my consigliore.

1:43:55.440 --> 1:43:59.060
 He was a guy I sought counsel and counseled me

1:43:59.060 --> 1:44:00.800
 and he's dead.

1:44:00.800 --> 1:44:02.460
 And I felt like there is no one

1:44:02.460 --> 1:44:05.560
 who's gonna honor the agreements that we had.

1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:07.160
 And he was a very soulful person.

1:44:07.160 --> 1:44:09.600
 He was so much better at being a scientist

1:44:09.600 --> 1:44:11.440
 than I could ever be.

1:44:11.440 --> 1:44:14.980
 And just a loss for the cosmos, it just really hurt.

1:44:14.980 --> 1:44:17.800
 And I thought, oh, it's so sad

1:44:17.800 --> 1:44:19.960
 cause he could have won the Nobel Prize.

1:44:19.960 --> 1:44:21.440
 I don't think like that anymore.

1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:23.200
 First I think about his kids.

1:44:23.200 --> 1:44:25.520
 Felt at first now there goes my chance

1:44:25.520 --> 1:44:26.500
 at winning a Nobel Prize.

1:44:26.500 --> 1:44:28.840
 And hence the title of the book was like,

1:44:28.840 --> 1:44:31.120
 I knew I would not win the Nobel Prize.

1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:33.000
 It also means that there's parts of the Nobel Prize

1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:34.200
 that have to be done away with.

1:44:34.200 --> 1:44:35.240
 It's a double entendre.

1:44:35.240 --> 1:44:37.480
 Like we need to lose aspects of the Nobel Prize

1:44:37.480 --> 1:44:38.600
 to help science out.

1:44:38.600 --> 1:44:40.040
 We can talk about that a different time.

1:44:40.040 --> 1:44:44.320
 But in the context of like now thinking back on it,

1:44:44.320 --> 1:44:46.220
 that was such a minuscule part of it.

1:44:46.220 --> 1:44:49.240
 Because let's say he did win the Nobel Prize

1:44:49.240 --> 1:44:52.040
 or I did win the, or any of us did.

1:44:52.040 --> 1:44:53.280
 Would that have changed anything?

1:44:53.280 --> 1:44:55.140
 Would that have brought anything back?

1:44:55.140 --> 1:44:58.800
 It's so, we say it's like vanity, it's futility.

1:44:58.800 --> 1:45:03.800
 And I just, for me, the Nobel Prize is like,

1:45:04.120 --> 1:45:06.120
 I don't wanna say it's like insignificant,

1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:07.680
 because obviously it has a lot of power

1:45:07.680 --> 1:45:08.680
 and it has influence.

1:45:08.680 --> 1:45:11.520
 And I went back, I had Neil deGrasse Tyson on my show.

1:45:11.520 --> 1:45:13.040
 I'm gonna name drop, okay?

1:45:13.040 --> 1:45:14.880
 And he prepares.

1:45:14.880 --> 1:45:19.080
 He prepares like a surgeon before doing surgery

1:45:19.080 --> 1:45:20.440
 when he goes on a talk show.

1:45:20.440 --> 1:45:22.880
 So you see him going on Colbert Report.

1:45:22.880 --> 1:45:24.320
 You think, oh, they just have a banter.

1:45:24.320 --> 1:45:25.460
 He's just naturally gifted.

1:45:25.460 --> 1:45:27.120
 No, he said, no, no, no.

1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:29.760
 You say that, you're undermining what he does.

1:45:29.760 --> 1:45:31.280
 What he does is he goes back.

1:45:31.280 --> 1:45:33.680
 He watches the last month of Colbert Reports

1:45:33.680 --> 1:45:35.720
 or whatever it's called, late show.

1:45:35.720 --> 1:45:38.520
 And he says, how long does Steven pause between questions?

1:45:38.520 --> 1:45:41.240
 How long in the news cycle does he go back?

1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:44.200
 What topics has he talked about with people similar to me?

1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:46.600
 So I took Neil and I did that for you.

1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:48.240
 And I look back, how many times has Lex

1:45:48.240 --> 1:45:50.200
 mentioned the words Nobel and prize?

1:45:50.200 --> 1:45:53.440
 And I put it into Google Ngram and out came

1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:58.000
 exactly the same number of times as show episodes

1:45:58.000 --> 1:45:58.960
 as of this moment.

1:45:58.960 --> 1:46:01.680
 So you've said the words Nobel Prize over 240 times.

1:46:01.680 --> 1:46:05.560
 Yeah, I mean, it is so strange as a symbol

1:46:05.560 --> 1:46:08.980
 that kind of unites this whole scientific journey, right?

1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:14.520
 It's so, it's both sad and beautiful

1:46:14.520 --> 1:46:19.520
 that a little prize, a little award, a medal,

1:46:19.800 --> 1:46:21.960
 a little plaque, they'll be most likely forgotten

1:46:21.960 --> 1:46:26.260
 by history completely, some silly list.

1:46:27.720 --> 1:46:31.880
 It's somehow a catalyst for greatness.

1:46:31.880 --> 1:46:36.880
 It resulted in you doing your life's work, the dream of it.

1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:39.720
 Would I have done it without the Nobel Prize?

1:46:39.720 --> 1:46:42.080
 I can't necessarily counterfactually state

1:46:42.080 --> 1:46:43.480
 that that would have happened.

1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:46.040
 So no, it definitely has a place.

1:46:47.480 --> 1:46:50.320
 And for me, it is valuable to think about it.

1:46:50.320 --> 1:46:54.840
 But the level of obsession that academics have about it

1:46:54.840 --> 1:46:58.520
 is really, I think it is almost on balance

1:46:58.520 --> 1:47:00.140
 becoming unhealthy.

1:47:00.140 --> 1:47:03.280
 And again, I have no, I make no truck

1:47:03.280 --> 1:47:04.840
 with the winners of the Nobel Prize.

1:47:04.840 --> 1:47:08.200
 Obviously, now I've had 11 on the show.

1:47:08.200 --> 1:47:10.560
 And to think about the one rule,

1:47:10.560 --> 1:47:13.740
 so by the way, right after the denouement of the story,

1:47:13.740 --> 1:47:15.480
 which I'll get to in a bit,

1:47:15.480 --> 1:47:18.280
 how our dreams went down to dust and ashes,

1:47:18.280 --> 1:47:21.460
 I was asked by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences

1:47:21.460 --> 1:47:25.420
 to nominate the winners of the 2015 Nobel Prize in physics.

1:47:25.420 --> 1:47:27.380
 So like the one that I theoretically

1:47:27.380 --> 1:47:31.460
 could have been eligible to win in 2016, actually,

1:47:31.460 --> 1:47:32.340
 they asked me to nominate.

1:47:32.340 --> 1:47:33.660
 Now imagine if I ask you, Lex,

1:47:33.660 --> 1:47:37.100
 you say, Brian, instead of me inviting myself on the show,

1:47:37.100 --> 1:47:38.620
 if you say, Brian, would you like to come

1:47:38.620 --> 1:47:40.060
 on the Lex Friedman podcast?

1:47:40.060 --> 1:47:42.140
 I say, you know what, Lex?

1:47:42.140 --> 1:47:42.980
 You know that guy Rogan?

1:47:42.980 --> 1:47:44.120
 I think you might know him.

1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:46.020
 Can you introduce him to me?

1:47:46.020 --> 1:47:47.740
 Like, do you imagine how that would feel?

1:47:47.740 --> 1:47:50.020
 Like you'd be like, ah, you know.

1:47:50.020 --> 1:47:51.340
 So I was asked to nominate the winners.

1:47:51.340 --> 1:47:53.420
 And the one rule that they say,

1:47:53.420 --> 1:47:55.860
 of all the rules that Alfred Nobel stipulated,

1:47:55.860 --> 1:47:57.760
 there's only one rule that they maintained.

1:47:57.760 --> 1:47:59.980
 In other words, he said one person can win it

1:47:59.980 --> 1:48:02.960
 for something they discovered in the preceding year

1:48:02.960 --> 1:48:06.140
 that had the greatest benefit to mankind,

1:48:06.140 --> 1:48:07.900
 made the world better, right?

1:48:07.900 --> 1:48:09.540
 None of that was mentioned in the letter.

1:48:09.540 --> 1:48:12.380
 It said many people can win it, worked on long ago.

1:48:12.380 --> 1:48:14.040
 They didn't mention anything in the letter to me,

1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:15.740
 signed by the Secretary General.

1:48:15.740 --> 1:48:16.980
 Nothing about benefiting mankind.

1:48:16.980 --> 1:48:20.220
 They said, just one thing, can't nominate yourself.

1:48:20.220 --> 1:48:22.180
 So none of these guys nominated themselves.

1:48:22.180 --> 1:48:23.820
 Actually, little known fact,

1:48:23.820 --> 1:48:26.440
 they sent that exact letter just to you.

1:48:28.060 --> 1:48:29.940
 That rule was created just for you.

1:48:29.940 --> 1:48:32.860
 That's called the Keating Correlate, yes, exactly.

1:48:32.860 --> 1:48:34.820
 Just to like. Good for them.

1:48:36.140 --> 1:48:37.640
 Rub it in.

1:48:37.640 --> 1:48:39.980
 I mean, in this particular case, of course,

1:48:39.980 --> 1:48:42.380
 there's some weird technicality or whatever,

1:48:42.380 --> 1:48:43.700
 but in this particular case,

1:48:43.700 --> 1:48:47.180
 it's kind of a powerful reminder.

1:48:47.180 --> 1:48:48.020
 Yeah.

1:48:48.020 --> 1:48:51.360
 That the Nobel Prize leaves a lot of people behind

1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:54.360
 in their stories behind all of that.

1:48:54.360 --> 1:48:55.540
 Yeah, I mean, here's a good example.

1:48:55.540 --> 1:48:57.060
 Again, this is my friend, Barry Barash.

1:48:57.060 --> 1:48:59.260
 He's become like a mentor and a friend.

1:49:00.220 --> 1:49:03.060
 He wrote the foreword to my book, Into the Impossible.

1:49:03.060 --> 1:49:07.060
 He won the Nobel Prize because a different guy died,

1:49:07.060 --> 1:49:09.060
 and he admits it, and he said it.

1:49:09.060 --> 1:49:10.300
 And actually, it's funny with him

1:49:10.300 --> 1:49:13.500
 because I've heard you talk very rhapsodically

1:49:13.500 --> 1:49:15.460
 and lovingly and romantically about,

1:49:15.460 --> 1:49:17.740
 with Harry Kliff and a wonderful podcast with him,

1:49:17.740 --> 1:49:21.220
 by the way, about the LHC and how wonderful it is

1:49:21.220 --> 1:49:23.540
 and how in that we were about to build

1:49:23.540 --> 1:49:27.020
 the superconducting supercollider right here in Texas,

1:49:27.020 --> 1:49:30.320
 and it didn't get built and it got canceled by Congress.

1:49:30.320 --> 1:49:31.240
 And I say to Barry,

1:49:31.240 --> 1:49:33.000
 that was the best thing that ever happened to you.

1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:34.300
 And he's like, what the hell are you talking about?

1:49:34.300 --> 1:49:35.840
 I'm like, if that didn't get canceled,

1:49:35.840 --> 1:49:39.420
 first of all, even though it did get canceled,

1:49:39.420 --> 1:49:41.860
 the Europeans went on to build it themselves,

1:49:41.860 --> 1:49:44.300
 saved the American taxpayers billions of dollars,

1:49:44.300 --> 1:49:46.100
 and we wouldn't have learned anything

1:49:46.100 --> 1:49:48.660
 really substantially new as proven by the fact

1:49:48.660 --> 1:49:50.220
 that as you and Harry talked about,

1:49:50.220 --> 1:49:52.780
 nothing besides the Higgs particle of great note

1:49:52.780 --> 1:49:55.260
 has come out, and actually, he's had a recent paper,

1:49:55.260 --> 1:49:57.660
 but it's been an upper limit along with his collaborators

1:49:57.660 --> 1:50:00.500
 on LHCb experiment that I'm gonna be talking with him about.

1:50:00.500 --> 1:50:02.500
 But the bottom line is it was really built

1:50:02.500 --> 1:50:03.340
 to detect the Higgs.

1:50:03.340 --> 1:50:06.280
 So the SSC, for twice as much money,

1:50:06.280 --> 1:50:07.740
 would have sucked up Barry's career.

1:50:07.740 --> 1:50:09.780
 He would have been working on that, maybe not.

1:50:09.780 --> 1:50:11.980
 And then he would never have worked on LIGO,

1:50:11.980 --> 1:50:14.020
 and then he wouldn't have won the Nobel Prize, right?

1:50:14.020 --> 1:50:15.500
 So you look at counterfactual history.

1:50:15.500 --> 1:50:17.000
 That's not actually a big stretch, right?

1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:19.140
 If the SSC had still gone on, he would have worked on it,

1:50:19.140 --> 1:50:20.540
 because he was one of the primary leaders

1:50:20.540 --> 1:50:21.900
 of that experiment.

1:50:21.900 --> 1:50:26.300
 Second thing, imagine the following thing had happened.

1:50:26.300 --> 1:50:30.480
 They won the Nobel Prize because in September 2015,

1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:32.360
 they detected unequivocal evidence

1:50:32.360 --> 1:50:35.940
 for the in spiral collision of two massive black holes,

1:50:35.940 --> 1:50:38.220
 each about 30 times the mass of the sun,

1:50:38.220 --> 1:50:42.420
 leaving behind an object that had just less than 60 solar

1:50:42.420 --> 1:50:43.180
 masses behind.

1:50:43.180 --> 1:50:45.780
 So one solar mass worth of matter

1:50:45.780 --> 1:50:49.040
 got massed, got converted to pure gravitational energy.

1:50:49.040 --> 1:50:51.260
 No light was seen by them.

1:50:51.260 --> 1:50:57.060
 This particular date, September 14, 2015,

1:50:57.060 --> 1:50:59.940
 that explosion, because of the miracle of time travel

1:50:59.940 --> 1:51:03.380
 that telescopes afford us, that actually took place

1:51:03.380 --> 1:51:07.260
 1.2 billion years ago in a galaxy far, far away.

1:51:07.260 --> 1:51:08.900
 They actually don't know which galaxy it took place in.

1:51:08.900 --> 1:51:10.460
 Still, then they never will.

1:51:10.460 --> 1:51:11.740
 OK?

1:51:11.740 --> 1:51:13.780
 If that collision between these two things, which

1:51:13.780 --> 1:51:16.460
 have probably been orbiting each other for maybe a million

1:51:16.460 --> 1:51:20.220
 years or more, if that had occurred 15 days earlier,

1:51:20.220 --> 1:51:22.700
 Barry wouldn't have won the Nobel Prize.

1:51:22.700 --> 1:51:25.740
 Because it's hilarious to think that there's one

1:51:25.740 --> 1:51:29.780
 human that won the Nobel Prize because two giant things

1:51:29.780 --> 1:51:31.300
 collided.

1:51:31.300 --> 1:51:34.300
 A billion, 200 million years ago.

1:51:34.300 --> 1:51:37.340
 And if it had happened 18 days, 20 days, 30 days,

1:51:37.340 --> 1:51:40.100
 because that was the deadline for the Nobel Prize

1:51:40.100 --> 1:51:43.260
 to be announced, they announced the findings in February.

1:51:43.260 --> 1:51:45.340
 But you have to nominate the winners in January.

1:51:45.340 --> 1:51:48.060
 So I could have nominated them up until January 30.

1:51:48.060 --> 1:51:49.860
 But they didn't announce anything,

1:51:49.860 --> 1:51:53.020
 and there were just rumors.

1:51:53.020 --> 1:51:54.620
 But the reason that he wouldn't have won it,

1:51:54.620 --> 1:51:56.700
 because there was another guy who was still alive,

1:51:56.700 --> 1:52:00.100
 considered to be the founder and father of the three fathers,

1:52:00.100 --> 1:52:02.460
 Ray Weiss, who did win it, Kip Thorne, who did win it,

1:52:02.460 --> 1:52:05.180
 and this third gentleman at Caltech named Ron Drever,

1:52:05.180 --> 1:52:07.060
 who passed away again.

1:52:07.060 --> 1:52:08.780
 He was alive in 2016.

1:52:08.780 --> 1:52:10.140
 He died in the middle of 2017.

1:52:10.140 --> 1:52:12.660
 And then he was awarded the Nobel Prize.

1:52:12.660 --> 1:52:16.580
 And here we are, several billion of hairless apes

1:52:16.580 --> 1:52:23.500
 that strangely wear clothing, celebrated three other clothed

1:52:23.500 --> 1:52:30.620
 hairless apes with a medal, with one particular element.

1:52:30.620 --> 1:52:33.980
 And then they made speeches in a particular language

1:52:33.980 --> 1:52:35.180
 that evolved in a...

1:52:35.180 --> 1:52:38.780
 Bend down to get those medals in front of another guy

1:52:38.780 --> 1:52:43.140
 who wears even fancier clothes, who is the king of Sweden.

1:52:43.140 --> 1:52:44.860
 And then they got some free food afterwards.

1:52:44.860 --> 1:52:47.020
 They get some reindeer meat, that's right.

1:52:47.020 --> 1:52:49.860
 Okay, excellent.

1:52:49.860 --> 1:52:53.060
 Since you mentioned Joe Rogan in that little example,

1:52:53.060 --> 1:52:57.180
 what happened to you in terms of BICEP2?

1:52:57.180 --> 1:53:00.940
 I want to kind of speak at a high level

1:53:00.940 --> 1:53:02.500
 about a particular thing I observed.

1:53:02.500 --> 1:53:05.860
 So I was a fan of Joe Rogan since he started the podcast.

1:53:05.860 --> 1:53:07.020
 I just listened to the podcast.

1:53:07.020 --> 1:53:09.540
 I'm a huge fan of podcasts in general.

1:53:09.540 --> 1:53:15.580
 And it also coincided with my entry into grad school

1:53:15.580 --> 1:53:17.580
 and this whole journey of academia.

1:53:17.580 --> 1:53:20.500
 So grad school, getting my PhD, then going to MIT,

1:53:20.500 --> 1:53:23.900
 and then Google, and then just looking at this whole world

1:53:23.900 --> 1:53:26.540
 of research.

1:53:26.540 --> 1:53:33.660
 What I really loved about how Joe Rogan approaches the world

1:53:33.660 --> 1:53:37.340
 is that he celebrates others, like he promotes them.

1:53:37.340 --> 1:53:39.860
 He gets like genuinely, and I now know this

1:53:39.860 --> 1:53:42.740
 from just being a friend privately,

1:53:42.740 --> 1:53:47.740
 he genuinely gets excited by the success of others.

1:53:47.740 --> 1:53:53.140
 And the contrast of that to how folks in academia

1:53:53.140 --> 1:53:56.660
 often behave was always really disappointing to me

1:53:56.660 --> 1:54:00.700
 because the natural, just on a basic human level,

1:54:00.700 --> 1:54:04.940
 there is an excitement, but the nature of that excitement

1:54:04.940 --> 1:54:08.620
 is more like I'm happy for my friend,

1:54:08.620 --> 1:54:11.380
 but I'm really jealous and I want to even outdo them.

1:54:11.380 --> 1:54:13.940
 I want to celebrate them, but I want to do even better.

1:54:13.940 --> 1:54:15.980
 So that's even for friends.

1:54:15.980 --> 1:54:21.140
 So there's not a genuine, pure excitement for others.

1:54:21.140 --> 1:54:24.980
 And then to couple that with just you now

1:54:24.980 --> 1:54:28.220
 as a host of a popular podcast and all this feeling,

1:54:28.220 --> 1:54:31.180
 which is like there's not even a willingness

1:54:31.180 --> 1:54:35.260
 to celebrate publicly the awesomeness of others.

1:54:35.260 --> 1:54:40.900
 People in academia are often best equipped technically

1:54:40.900 --> 1:54:43.340
 in terms of language to celebrate others.

1:54:43.340 --> 1:54:48.060
 They understand the beauty, like the full richness

1:54:48.060 --> 1:54:50.980
 of why the cool idea is as cool as it is.

1:54:50.980 --> 1:54:53.340
 And they're in the best position to celebrate it.

1:54:53.340 --> 1:54:57.020
 And yet there's a feeling that if I celebrate others,

1:54:57.020 --> 1:54:59.900
 they might end up on the cover of Nature or whatever,

1:54:59.900 --> 1:55:01.740
 and not me.

1:55:01.740 --> 1:55:03.860
 They turn it into zero sum game.

1:55:03.860 --> 1:55:08.500
 The reason why I think Rogan has been an inspiration to me

1:55:08.500 --> 1:55:12.060
 and many others is that it doesn't have to be that way.

1:55:12.060 --> 1:55:15.300
 And forget money and all those kinds of things.

1:55:15.300 --> 1:55:20.300
 I think there's a narrative told that academics are this way

1:55:20.300 --> 1:55:23.180
 because there's a limited amount of money.

1:55:23.180 --> 1:55:24.500
 And so they're fighting for this.

1:55:24.500 --> 1:55:28.460
 I don't think that's the reason it's happening this way.

1:55:28.460 --> 1:55:32.860
 I think you can have a limited amount of money.

1:55:32.860 --> 1:55:36.860
 The battle for money happens in the space of proposal.

1:55:36.860 --> 1:55:39.340
 There's networking, there's private stuff.

1:55:39.340 --> 1:55:42.780
 Public celebration of others and just actually

1:55:42.780 --> 1:55:46.140
 just how you feel in the privacy of your own heart

1:55:46.140 --> 1:55:48.500
 is not have to do anything with money.

1:55:48.500 --> 1:55:51.940
 It has to do with you having a big ego

1:55:51.940 --> 1:55:55.020
 and not humbling yourself to the beauty of the journey

1:55:55.020 --> 1:55:56.460
 that we're all on.

1:55:56.460 --> 1:56:00.540
 And there's folks like Joe Rogan who in a comedian circles

1:56:00.540 --> 1:56:03.900
 is also rare, but he inspired all these other comedians

1:56:03.900 --> 1:56:05.540
 to realize, you know what?

1:56:05.540 --> 1:56:07.060
 It's great to celebrate each other.

1:56:07.060 --> 1:56:10.300
 We're promoting each other and therefore the pie grows.

1:56:10.300 --> 1:56:12.860
 Cause everybody else gets excited about this whole thing

1:56:12.860 --> 1:56:14.060
 and the pie grows.

1:56:14.060 --> 1:56:16.420
 Right now the scientists by fighting,

1:56:16.420 --> 1:56:18.620
 like by not celebrating each other,

1:56:18.620 --> 1:56:19.980
 are not growing the pie.

1:56:19.980 --> 1:56:23.180
 And now because of that sort of science becomes

1:56:23.180 --> 1:56:24.020
 less and less popular.

1:56:24.020 --> 1:56:25.620
 It's a flywheel and exactly.

1:56:25.620 --> 1:56:26.700
 No, and I want to point out two things.

1:56:26.700 --> 1:56:29.860
 One is that I remember you went on Joe's show

1:56:29.860 --> 1:56:34.460
 maybe a couple of years ago and then he gave you a watch.

1:56:34.460 --> 1:56:36.220
 He gave you like a Rolex, right?

1:56:36.220 --> 1:56:38.860
 And I tweeted to you and I think it's Omega, sorry.

1:56:38.860 --> 1:56:40.300
 Okay, fine.

1:56:40.300 --> 1:56:42.420
 The watch that went to the moon,

1:56:42.420 --> 1:56:44.620
 which we will get to in a bit.

1:56:44.620 --> 1:56:46.300
 I don't think he could give you what I gave you though,

1:56:46.300 --> 1:56:47.660
 by the way.

1:56:47.660 --> 1:56:50.540
 And we'll get to what that final gift package is for you.

1:56:50.540 --> 1:56:52.300
 And by the way, I also wanted to mention,

1:56:52.300 --> 1:56:55.180
 because when you said Joe Rogan, I would not be upset.

1:56:55.180 --> 1:56:57.060
 And you should definitely go on Joe Rogan.

1:56:57.060 --> 1:56:59.620
 And we had this conversation with him.

1:56:59.620 --> 1:57:04.620
 Cause I was like, when I was moving to Austin

1:57:05.260 --> 1:57:07.300
 and had a conversation like, don't you think it's weird?

1:57:07.300 --> 1:57:09.420
 Like if we have the same guests at the same time

1:57:09.420 --> 1:57:12.580
 or whatever, he's like, fuck that.

1:57:12.580 --> 1:57:14.580
 I want you to be more successful than me.

1:57:14.580 --> 1:57:18.540
 I want, he truly wants everybody like,

1:57:18.540 --> 1:57:21.060
 especially people close to him to be more successful.

1:57:21.060 --> 1:57:23.180
 Like there's not even a thought like.

1:57:23.180 --> 1:57:24.220
 But you know why he does.

1:57:24.220 --> 1:57:25.060
 And this is what I tweeted to you.

1:57:25.060 --> 1:57:27.340
 And one of the few things I think you have retweeted

1:57:27.340 --> 1:57:28.180
 that I sent you.

1:57:28.180 --> 1:57:31.020
 I said, someday you're going to give that to somebody.

1:57:31.020 --> 1:57:32.540
 And today I wanted that to be me.

1:57:32.540 --> 1:57:33.380
 No, no.

1:57:35.580 --> 1:57:36.420
 Joe's Omega.

1:57:36.420 --> 1:57:40.220
 No, but the point is he sees in you that same,

1:57:40.220 --> 1:57:42.980
 grandiosity, that same genuine spirit graciousness.

1:57:42.980 --> 1:57:43.820
 And I think that's true.

1:57:43.820 --> 1:57:45.460
 And you do do something very rare.

1:57:45.460 --> 1:57:47.260
 I don't want to turn this into too much of a love fest,

1:57:47.260 --> 1:57:49.980
 but I do want to say even back to Andrew,

1:57:49.980 --> 1:57:52.780
 who I've almost been hagiographic about,

1:57:52.780 --> 1:57:54.220
 just treating him like a saint.

1:57:54.220 --> 1:57:55.060
 He said to me the same thing.

1:57:55.060 --> 1:57:57.980
 And in a moment of peak said like,

1:57:57.980 --> 1:57:58.820
 God damn it.

1:57:58.820 --> 1:58:02.460
 Like I have to train these guys and women that work for me

1:58:02.460 --> 1:58:04.220
 so that they can be better than me,

1:58:04.220 --> 1:58:06.320
 so that they can go out and compete with me

1:58:06.320 --> 1:58:09.860
 for the same limited amount of funding from the Fing NSL.

1:58:09.860 --> 1:58:12.060
 That wasn't his, that wasn't who he was.

1:58:12.060 --> 1:58:14.060
 That was just an expression,

1:58:14.060 --> 1:58:16.460
 like I'm doing something which is fundamentally,

1:58:16.460 --> 1:58:18.960
 but you know what, when you have kids,

1:58:18.960 --> 1:58:20.900
 hopefully, you know, please God, you will someday.

1:58:20.900 --> 1:58:22.660
 Cause I think, and I hope we can get to talk

1:58:22.660 --> 1:58:26.060
 about that later, but part of investment

1:58:26.060 --> 1:58:28.580
 and part of doing something when you have a kid,

1:58:28.580 --> 1:58:30.420
 like you can get married.

1:58:30.420 --> 1:58:33.020
 You can marry someone cause she's rich or he's rich,

1:58:33.020 --> 1:58:35.100
 or you can marry someone cause they're good looking

1:58:35.100 --> 1:58:36.300
 or he's good looking.

1:58:36.300 --> 1:58:37.940
 You can marry for all these different reasons

1:58:37.940 --> 1:58:39.980
 that are ultimately selfish.

1:58:39.980 --> 1:58:41.860
 There's no way you can have a kid and be selfish.

1:58:41.860 --> 1:58:43.140
 Nobody says like, oh, you know what?

1:58:43.140 --> 1:58:44.960
 I really want this thing that's three feet tall,

1:58:44.960 --> 1:58:47.060
 that doesn't speak English, that craps on my floor,

1:58:47.060 --> 1:58:48.500
 that wakes me up all hours of the night,

1:58:48.500 --> 1:58:50.040
 that interferes with my love life.

1:58:50.040 --> 1:58:52.120
 Nobody says that cause it doesn't benefit you

1:58:52.120 --> 1:58:53.060
 for months and months.

1:58:53.060 --> 1:58:55.100
 A friend of mine who actually does the videos for me

1:58:55.100 --> 1:58:57.180
 and does a lot of my solo videos,

1:58:57.180 --> 1:58:59.300
 he's having his first kid, he's like, what do I do?

1:58:59.300 --> 1:59:01.660
 Cause it always gets stupid, I'll catch up on sleep now.

1:59:01.660 --> 1:59:04.340
 Like, yeah, I'm gonna store sleep in my sleep bank.

1:59:04.340 --> 1:59:06.700
 Like I don't think Huberman and you talked about that, right?

1:59:06.700 --> 1:59:08.080
 You can't do that, that's stupid.

1:59:08.080 --> 1:59:10.840
 What you can do, give the kid a bath, feed the baby,

1:59:10.840 --> 1:59:11.820
 let the mother relax.

1:59:11.820 --> 1:59:14.060
 Like, in other words, do the things,

1:59:14.060 --> 1:59:16.380
 and this really relates back to what Aristotle once said.

1:59:16.380 --> 1:59:18.980
 Aristotle once said, why do parents love kids

1:59:18.980 --> 1:59:20.780
 more than kids love parents?

1:59:20.780 --> 1:59:22.760
 As much as you love your dad and your mom,

1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:24.580
 they still love you more.

1:59:24.580 --> 1:59:27.140
 And because you love that what you sacrifice for.

1:59:27.140 --> 1:59:28.780
 Here's a proof.

1:59:28.780 --> 1:59:31.020
 I know a lot of families that have kids with special needs.

1:59:31.020 --> 1:59:35.020
 Some with severe, one of my uncles on the Keating side

1:59:35.020 --> 1:59:37.280
 had a severe, what they called mental retardation,

1:59:37.280 --> 1:59:39.220
 now it's probably has a different name.

1:59:39.220 --> 1:59:41.980
 That, out of the nine other brothers and sisters,

1:59:41.980 --> 1:59:43.580
 he was their favorite.

1:59:43.580 --> 1:59:46.100
 Because they had to sacrifice so much for him.

1:59:46.100 --> 1:59:48.340
 And I think of that, you know, in the small case,

1:59:48.340 --> 1:59:50.340
 like Joe is kind of mentoring you or whatever,

1:59:50.340 --> 1:59:51.260
 you're gonna mentor someone else.

1:59:51.260 --> 1:59:53.620
 You love that what you sacrifice for.

1:59:53.620 --> 1:59:55.700
 Sacrifice is reduction of entropy,

1:59:55.700 --> 1:59:58.740
 it's storing and investing, and you wanna protect that.

1:59:58.740 --> 2:00:01.460
 And you know, that to me really speaks to this.

2:00:01.460 --> 2:00:02.900
 So yeah, I don't hold it against.

2:00:02.900 --> 2:00:05.540
 But it is true, like scientists are, you know,

2:00:05.540 --> 2:00:07.580
 when they're described again, they're often said

2:00:07.580 --> 2:00:08.420
 to be like children, right?

2:00:08.420 --> 2:00:09.380
 You've heard this description.

2:00:09.380 --> 2:00:11.580
 They're inquisitive, they're curious, they're passionate.

2:00:11.580 --> 2:00:12.420
 They love that.

2:00:12.420 --> 2:00:13.540
 And I'm like, yeah, and they don't play well with others.

2:00:13.540 --> 2:00:14.860
 They're jealous, they're petty, they're selfish,

2:00:14.860 --> 2:00:17.420
 they won't share their ball and they'll go home.

2:00:17.420 --> 2:00:19.060
 There's no such thing as a single edge sword.

2:00:19.060 --> 2:00:20.780
 I wish there were, you know,

2:00:20.780 --> 2:00:22.340
 because we need some more of that

2:00:22.340 --> 2:00:23.860
 because you gotta dull it up.

2:00:23.860 --> 2:00:26.500
 But in this case, he, you know,

2:00:26.500 --> 2:00:31.500
 I think when you have this kind of investment in science,

2:00:31.500 --> 2:00:32.900
 it's gonna be natural.

2:00:32.900 --> 2:00:34.580
 But that doesn't mean we have to like, you know,

2:00:34.580 --> 2:00:36.980
 feed the flames of competition.

2:00:36.980 --> 2:00:38.460
 You know, I'm like really venerate.

2:00:38.460 --> 2:00:40.340
 If you go to the homepage of the NSF

2:00:40.340 --> 2:00:41.740
 or the Department of Energy

2:00:41.740 --> 2:00:44.620
 or the recently released National Academy of Sciences

2:00:44.620 --> 2:00:47.980
 future of science for the astronomical sciences

2:00:47.980 --> 2:00:50.380
 for the next 25 years or more,

2:00:50.380 --> 2:00:51.860
 they talk about how many Nobel prizes

2:00:51.860 --> 2:00:53.580
 these different science things could win.

2:00:53.580 --> 2:00:56.500
 Exoplanets, life, the discovery of the CMB,

2:00:56.500 --> 2:00:58.980
 B mode polarization, the nice, you know,

2:00:58.980 --> 2:01:01.300
 that's figure two in this thing.

2:01:01.300 --> 2:01:03.140
 And I'm like, what message is that sent to kids,

2:01:03.140 --> 2:01:04.820
 like to young people?

2:01:04.820 --> 2:01:06.100
 Like that's what you should be doing

2:01:06.100 --> 2:01:07.380
 so that you win this small, as you said,

2:01:07.380 --> 2:01:09.140
 this prize given out by one hairless ape

2:01:09.140 --> 2:01:11.340
 to another wearing a fancier costume using reindeer.

2:01:11.340 --> 2:01:12.460
 Especially in the case of Nobel prize,

2:01:12.460 --> 2:01:14.780
 it's only currently given to three people.

2:01:14.780 --> 2:01:16.940
 At most, which was never one of his stipulate.

2:01:16.940 --> 2:01:19.300
 He actually said one, he could only give it to one person.

2:01:19.300 --> 2:01:20.140
 So they change it.

2:01:20.140 --> 2:01:20.980
 Why did they change it?

2:01:20.980 --> 2:01:22.180
 I talk about, I speculate.

2:01:22.180 --> 2:01:24.180
 By the way, the book's only three chapters out of 11

2:01:24.180 --> 2:01:26.900
 about the Nobel prize and it's a fact.

2:01:26.900 --> 2:01:28.940
 But you know, one of the things that's been so interesting,

2:01:28.940 --> 2:01:32.420
 like I'm speaking, actually this coming up in December

2:01:32.420 --> 2:01:34.500
 is that the Nobel prize is given out

2:01:34.500 --> 2:01:37.100
 on the day of Alfred Nobel's death.

2:01:37.100 --> 2:01:39.500
 There's a lot of, and they bring in flowers,

2:01:39.500 --> 2:01:42.060
 not from his birthplace, but from his mausoleum,

2:01:42.060 --> 2:01:46.780
 which is in San Romino in Italy.

2:01:46.780 --> 2:01:48.700
 It's a lot of like death fascination.

2:01:48.700 --> 2:01:51.300
 Denial of death features heavily in the Nobel prize

2:01:51.300 --> 2:01:53.660
 because it's like, what outlives a person?

2:01:53.660 --> 2:01:55.220
 Well, science can outlive a person.

2:01:55.220 --> 2:01:56.900
 My father has a theorem named after him.

2:01:56.900 --> 2:02:00.700
 It's still engraved in many places around the world.

2:02:00.700 --> 2:02:02.620
 You or I, we can go to different places around the world.

2:02:02.620 --> 2:02:05.060
 People know who we are based on our publications.

2:02:05.060 --> 2:02:06.660
 We engrave things, we want to store things,

2:02:06.660 --> 2:02:08.220
 we want to compress things.

2:02:08.220 --> 2:02:10.380
 And I think there's something beautiful about that,

2:02:10.380 --> 2:02:12.140
 but there is a notion of denial of death.

2:02:12.140 --> 2:02:14.780
 Like there is a notion of what will outlast me,

2:02:14.780 --> 2:02:17.860
 especially if you're among the many 90 something percent

2:02:17.860 --> 2:02:19.140
 of members of the National Academy

2:02:19.140 --> 2:02:24.140
 don't believe in an active faith and a creator and a God.

2:02:24.540 --> 2:02:27.620
 And science can substitute for that,

2:02:27.620 --> 2:02:30.700
 but it's not ultimately as fulfilling.

2:02:30.700 --> 2:02:34.340
 I just, I don't believe it can fulfill a person the way

2:02:34.340 --> 2:02:37.420
 even practicing, but not believing in a religion

2:02:37.420 --> 2:02:39.260
 can fulfill a person.

2:02:39.260 --> 2:02:40.860
 So, which is interesting

2:02:40.860 --> 2:02:42.500
 because you do bring up Ernest Becker

2:02:42.500 --> 2:02:46.660
 and the denial of death in losing the Nobel prize book.

2:02:46.660 --> 2:02:50.780
 And there is a sense in which that's probably in part

2:02:50.780 --> 2:02:54.300
 at the core of this, especially later dream

2:02:54.300 --> 2:02:57.100
 of the Nobel prize or a prize of recognition.

2:02:57.100 --> 2:03:02.100
 I've interacted with a few or a large number of scientists

2:03:02.140 --> 2:03:04.500
 that are getting up in age.

2:03:04.500 --> 2:03:09.500
 And there is the feeling of real pride of happiness in them

2:03:10.180 --> 2:03:15.180
 from winning awards and getting certain recognitions.

2:03:15.180 --> 2:03:18.500
 And I probably at the core of that is a kind of a mortality

2:03:18.500 --> 2:03:23.500
 or a kind of desire for mortality.

2:03:23.500 --> 2:03:28.500
 And that was always off putting to me as opposed to,

2:03:28.740 --> 2:03:32.340
 I mean, I know it sounds weird to say it's off putting,

2:03:32.340 --> 2:03:37.340
 but it just, rather than celebrating the pure joy

2:03:38.460 --> 2:03:43.460
 of solving the puzzles of the mysteries all around us,

2:03:43.460 --> 2:03:52.460
 just the actual exploration of the mysterious for its own sake.

2:03:52.460 --> 2:03:55.940
 Well, that's what I said, it's like a scientist should,

2:03:55.940 --> 2:03:58.860
 okay, you have to be careful and not have any physical,

2:03:58.860 --> 2:03:59.700
 it has to be platonic,

2:03:59.700 --> 2:04:03.180
 but you can think of scientists and mentor.

2:04:03.180 --> 2:04:05.300
 I have a chart in the book and in my plaque

2:04:05.300 --> 2:04:07.500
 made by one of my graduate students, former graduate students.

2:04:07.500 --> 2:04:10.620
 She's now a professor in New Mexico, Darcy Barron.

2:04:10.620 --> 2:04:13.980
 And she made this plaque and it has 17 generations.

2:04:13.980 --> 2:04:17.340
 So here I am, 17 levels down, there's a guy,

2:04:17.340 --> 2:04:19.620
 Leibniz, not the famous Leibniz, different Leibniz,

2:04:19.620 --> 2:04:23.100
 1596 he was born and I'm in this chain.

2:04:23.100 --> 2:04:24.660
 And I don't know if you know this,

2:04:24.660 --> 2:04:26.020
 but in the Russian language,

2:04:26.020 --> 2:04:28.980
 the word scientist means someone who was taught.

2:04:28.980 --> 2:04:31.300
 I'll say it very simply, one who was taught, right?

2:04:31.300 --> 2:04:32.140
 Uchony.

2:04:32.140 --> 2:04:32.980
 Uchony.

2:04:32.980 --> 2:04:35.180
 So it probably means a guy was taught, right?

2:04:35.180 --> 2:04:39.180
 No, uchony, no, no, no, it's a person.

2:04:39.180 --> 2:04:42.500
 Uchony, no, no, no, it's literally someone who was taught.

2:04:42.500 --> 2:04:43.900
 Someone who was taught, right.

2:04:43.900 --> 2:04:44.740
 So what does that mean?

2:04:44.740 --> 2:04:47.540
 To me, it has a dual kind of meaning, at least dual meaning.

2:04:47.540 --> 2:04:50.780
 One is that you have to be a good student to be a scientist

2:04:50.780 --> 2:04:52.620
 because you have to learn from somebody else.

2:04:52.620 --> 2:04:55.180
 Two, you have to be a teacher, you have to pay it forward.

2:04:55.180 --> 2:04:58.580
 If you don't, I claim you're really not a scientist

2:04:58.580 --> 2:05:00.180
 in the truest sense.

2:05:00.180 --> 2:05:02.220
 And I feel like with the work that I do in outreach

2:05:02.220 --> 2:05:04.300
 and stuff like that, I'm doing it at scale.

2:05:04.300 --> 2:05:07.140
 I'm influencing more than 24 kids I might have

2:05:07.140 --> 2:05:09.380
 in my graduate class or undergraduate class,

2:05:09.380 --> 2:05:11.660
 and potentially could reach thousands of people

2:05:11.660 --> 2:05:15.980
 around the world and make them into scientists themselves.

2:05:15.980 --> 2:05:19.060
 Because that's the flywheel that is only beneficial.

2:05:19.060 --> 2:05:20.420
 There is no competition.

2:05:20.420 --> 2:05:24.940
 There is no zero sum fixed mindset versus growth mindset

2:05:24.940 --> 2:05:26.460
 because it is an infinite game.

2:05:26.460 --> 2:05:29.260
 Imagine a culture that had none of the trappings

2:05:29.260 --> 2:05:30.980
 of the negativity of the Soviet Union

2:05:30.980 --> 2:05:35.620
 or pre World War I Germany or Imperial Japan.

2:05:35.620 --> 2:05:37.380
 Science celebrated.

2:05:37.380 --> 2:05:40.380
 And we're just making a nation of scientists.

2:05:40.380 --> 2:05:42.900
 And we're not doing it to become multi billionaires

2:05:42.900 --> 2:05:47.100
 or necessarily for any military purpose whatsoever.

2:05:47.100 --> 2:05:50.460
 But if we have that, sometimes I'm flying home at night.

2:05:50.460 --> 2:05:53.100
 When you fly into LA, you literally, it's very rare,

2:05:53.100 --> 2:05:55.100
 you can see the number 10 million.

2:05:55.100 --> 2:05:56.780
 It's very hard to visualize things.

2:05:56.780 --> 2:05:58.980
 You see a brick wall, you ask how many bricks are there?

2:05:58.980 --> 2:06:00.540
 It might be 1,000, 2,000.

2:06:00.540 --> 2:06:01.740
 10 million lights.

2:06:01.740 --> 2:06:03.380
 There's 10 million souls.

2:06:03.380 --> 2:06:04.940
 And you can see they're discrete.

2:06:04.940 --> 2:06:07.020
 They're not like the Milky Way all blending together.

2:06:07.020 --> 2:06:11.900
 Each lost in their own busy lives, excited, fall in love,

2:06:11.900 --> 2:06:13.900
 afraid of losing their job, all that.

2:06:13.900 --> 2:06:16.020
 By the way, people should know that you're a pilot.

2:06:16.020 --> 2:06:17.700
 So you literally mean fly.

2:06:17.700 --> 2:06:19.180
 Yeah, sometimes I get to do it.

2:06:19.180 --> 2:06:22.940
 You get to look at the eye of God perspective

2:06:22.940 --> 2:06:26.300
 on these 10 million, on these millions of helpless apes.

2:06:26.300 --> 2:06:28.220
 And I don't think they're like constellations,

2:06:28.220 --> 2:06:29.860
 but upside down, like the city.

2:06:29.860 --> 2:06:30.860
 This is like a constellation.

2:06:30.860 --> 2:06:32.580
 Hopefully I'll stay and keep the plane the right way up.

2:06:32.580 --> 2:06:34.060
 But when you think about that,

2:06:34.060 --> 2:06:36.260
 imagine they're all working together.

2:06:36.260 --> 2:06:38.340
 And imagine you always talk about love.

2:06:38.340 --> 2:06:42.260
 But you don't know that they're not worthy of love.

2:06:42.260 --> 2:06:43.500
 So you're looking down on them.

2:06:43.500 --> 2:06:44.380
 And it's just amazing.

2:06:44.380 --> 2:06:48.420
 Because you think, what amazing creation has man and humans?

2:06:48.420 --> 2:06:49.580
 And what can we do?

2:06:49.580 --> 2:06:50.620
 It's phenomenal.

2:06:50.620 --> 2:06:52.140
 It's so exciting.

2:06:52.140 --> 2:06:53.420
 And then I get to do it.

2:06:53.420 --> 2:06:55.260
 It's a job I say, don't tell Gavin Newsom,

2:06:55.260 --> 2:06:56.820
 but I do it for free.

2:06:56.820 --> 2:06:58.740
 I love what I do.

2:06:58.740 --> 2:07:01.620
 But to think about, oh, if my student succeeds, then I'm not.

2:07:01.620 --> 2:07:05.540
 No, it is unfortunate that you have experience.

2:07:05.540 --> 2:07:06.820
 I've certainly experienced it.

2:07:06.820 --> 2:07:08.980
 And I think there are ways around it.

2:07:08.980 --> 2:07:11.180
 I think it is a vexing problem.

2:07:11.180 --> 2:07:14.380
 Because people want to, it's very tempting

2:07:14.380 --> 2:07:18.180
 to keep your own garden fertilized.

2:07:18.180 --> 2:07:20.340
 One thing that's interesting is people are like,

2:07:20.340 --> 2:07:21.500
 why are you doing this thing?

2:07:21.500 --> 2:07:22.900
 And podcasts, and you're supposed

2:07:22.900 --> 2:07:25.380
 to be a serious scientist leading this huge project,

2:07:25.380 --> 2:07:27.780
 and collaborators.

2:07:27.780 --> 2:07:30.860
 And I'm like, well, most of what I do, as I said before,

2:07:30.860 --> 2:07:31.660
 for you it's Velcro.

2:07:31.660 --> 2:07:36.220
 For me it's like, what is the deal with the safety standards

2:07:36.220 --> 2:07:38.660
 on the truck that we're driving up to deliver the diesel fuel

2:07:38.660 --> 2:07:39.780
 that will power the generator that

2:07:39.780 --> 2:07:40.980
 will allow the concrete truck to move?

2:07:40.980 --> 2:07:42.820
 It has nothing to do with the Big Bang

2:07:42.820 --> 2:07:45.140
 inflation, the multiverse, God's existence.

2:07:45.140 --> 2:07:45.900
 It has nothing to do with that.

2:07:45.900 --> 2:07:48.340
 So those are people I say I have to talk to.

2:07:48.340 --> 2:07:49.980
 The people that come on the show, those

2:07:49.980 --> 2:07:51.500
 are people I want to talk to.

2:07:51.500 --> 2:07:52.420
 And that's super fun.

2:07:52.420 --> 2:07:55.900
 I mean, it's a real honor that I get to do it.

2:07:55.900 --> 2:07:57.580
 I have some unfair advantages.

2:07:57.580 --> 2:07:58.660
 I'm at a top university.

2:07:58.660 --> 2:08:01.060
 We have people that's affiliated with the Arthur C. Clark

2:08:01.060 --> 2:08:04.500
 Foundation, brilliant scientists coming through.

2:08:04.500 --> 2:08:06.900
 But I felt like it would be kind of a shame

2:08:06.900 --> 2:08:09.820
 if I didn't allow them to teach at scale,

2:08:09.820 --> 2:08:11.900
 because they're better teachers than I am.

2:08:11.900 --> 2:08:16.620
 Let me ask you an interesting, maybe difficult question.

2:08:16.620 --> 2:08:21.340
 Have you ever considered talking on your podcast

2:08:21.340 --> 2:08:24.500
 with the people who would get the Nobel Prize for BICEP2

2:08:24.500 --> 2:08:28.220
 if it turned out to be detecting what it is?

2:08:28.220 --> 2:08:30.300
 Yeah, I mean, I'm still friends with them.

2:08:30.300 --> 2:08:32.060
 And they have still gone on to.

2:08:32.060 --> 2:08:34.580
 So we should say why we didn't win the Nobel Prize,

2:08:34.580 --> 2:08:37.940
 and then what happened with the group that

2:08:37.940 --> 2:08:41.060
 is now leading it that I'm completely divorced

2:08:41.060 --> 2:08:43.580
 from in a secular sense.

2:08:43.580 --> 2:08:44.580
 We're friends.

2:08:44.580 --> 2:08:45.940
 We see each other.

2:08:45.940 --> 2:08:48.220
 We send each other emails and stuff like that.

2:08:48.220 --> 2:08:50.340
 I would love to get their sense of what

2:08:50.340 --> 2:08:54.300
 the natural heartbreak built into the whole process

2:08:54.300 --> 2:08:56.140
 of the Nobel Prize, what their sense is.

2:08:56.140 --> 2:08:58.860
 I would love to hear an honest, real conversation.

2:08:58.860 --> 2:09:01.780
 I understand you're friends, but there's some hard truth

2:09:01.780 --> 2:09:03.340
 that even friends don't talk about until you put a mic.

2:09:03.340 --> 2:09:04.180
 They weren't happy I wrote the book.

2:09:04.180 --> 2:09:06.580
 I mean, I remember one of them was like, well,

2:09:06.580 --> 2:09:07.860
 what's this I hear about a book?

2:09:07.860 --> 2:09:10.180
 And I mean, a lot of people told me not to write the book.

2:09:10.180 --> 2:09:12.620
 They said it's going to give too much attention

2:09:12.620 --> 2:09:13.460
 to the Nobel Prize.

2:09:13.460 --> 2:09:15.180
 It's going to look like sour grapes.

2:09:15.180 --> 2:09:17.740
 Again, I say you can prove I have sour grapes or not.

2:09:17.740 --> 2:09:19.740
 Just give me the next prize.

2:09:19.740 --> 2:09:21.860
 So if you get a Nobel Prize for literature,

2:09:21.860 --> 2:09:23.060
 you would turn it down?

2:09:23.060 --> 2:09:24.180
 I don't know.

2:09:24.180 --> 2:09:26.340
 It's funny, because Sabina Hassenfelder,

2:09:26.340 --> 2:09:30.020
 who is a fellow YouTube sensation,

2:09:30.020 --> 2:09:35.300
 and she's so gracious and so good.

2:09:35.300 --> 2:09:40.300
 She has that German, just gentle and genteelness.

2:09:40.300 --> 2:09:43.180
 She's a little too nice for my taste, I would say.

2:09:43.180 --> 2:09:45.220
 I wish she could really say what she thinks and be

2:09:45.220 --> 2:09:46.420
 snarky on occasion.

2:09:46.420 --> 2:09:48.660
 So she wrote a review of my book when it came out

2:09:48.660 --> 2:09:49.900
 three or four years ago.

2:09:49.900 --> 2:09:53.220
 And she said, well, you know, Brian Keating,

2:09:53.220 --> 2:09:55.620
 she said, well, it's interesting.

2:09:55.620 --> 2:09:57.020
 He talks a lot about cosmology.

2:09:57.020 --> 2:10:00.060
 But they can do whatever the hell they want.

2:10:00.060 --> 2:10:02.740
 And he presumably has these problems with it,

2:10:02.740 --> 2:10:05.820
 but it's none of his business, basically.

2:10:05.820 --> 2:10:08.500
 And at the end, she said, but if you want one good thing,

2:10:08.500 --> 2:10:09.500
 he's a really good writer.

2:10:09.500 --> 2:10:10.500
 And who knows?

2:10:10.500 --> 2:10:12.980
 He could win the Nobel Prize in literature someday.

2:10:12.980 --> 2:10:14.580
 And then she allowed me to publish a rebuttal

2:10:14.580 --> 2:10:16.080
 on her blog, which was kind of funny.

2:10:16.080 --> 2:10:17.380
 But anyway, no.

2:10:17.380 --> 2:10:21.300
 So getting back to the guys that we were kind of collaboratimies

2:10:21.300 --> 2:10:24.620
 or frenemies, we're still, look, we

2:10:24.620 --> 2:10:26.380
 don't wish each other active ill.

2:10:26.380 --> 2:10:27.340
 I've visited them.

2:10:27.340 --> 2:10:28.540
 They're welcome to visit me.

2:10:28.540 --> 2:10:29.940
 They have visited me.

2:10:29.940 --> 2:10:31.620
 The thing I have to say is that I just

2:10:31.620 --> 2:10:33.820
 wonder about introspection.

2:10:33.820 --> 2:10:38.500
 For me, literally, I don't care about the Nobel Prize

2:10:38.500 --> 2:10:42.000
 other than what it can do to benefit science.

2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:43.740
 But I no longer, I did, but by the way,

2:10:43.740 --> 2:10:46.460
 I did seriously care about how it would benefit Brian Keating

2:10:46.460 --> 2:10:47.460
 early on in my career.

2:10:47.460 --> 2:10:48.580
 I'm just totally honest.

2:10:48.580 --> 2:10:50.060
 I'm not proud of it.

2:10:50.060 --> 2:10:51.420
 It's kind of embarrassing.

2:10:51.420 --> 2:10:53.940
 But now I would hope that people would say, like, OK,

2:10:53.940 --> 2:10:56.860
 the guy is like, you know, he's obsessed with it.

2:10:56.860 --> 2:10:58.580
 My next book is not about this.

2:10:58.580 --> 2:11:00.300
 It's about something completely different.

2:11:00.300 --> 2:11:05.860
 And I do feel like people lack introspection a lot of times

2:11:05.860 --> 2:11:06.460
 in science.

2:11:06.460 --> 2:11:08.820
 We don't think about why we're doing what we're doing.

2:11:08.820 --> 2:11:11.740
 And I think it comes down to curiosity.

2:11:11.740 --> 2:11:14.860
 One thing about Joe, and again, I've only listened to,

2:11:14.860 --> 2:11:16.300
 like, I have to confess.

2:11:16.300 --> 2:11:17.460
 You know, you're like, my father.

2:11:17.460 --> 2:11:19.420
 Now I'm confessing my sins to you, Father Lex.

2:11:19.420 --> 2:11:21.620
 Father Friedman.

2:11:21.620 --> 2:11:24.380
 I haven't listened to, like, that many of your episodes

2:11:24.380 --> 2:11:25.380
 start to finish, OK?

2:11:25.380 --> 2:11:27.060
 I'm with our friend, mutual friend, Eric.

2:11:27.060 --> 2:11:30.420
 I've listened to a bunch of recent ones.

2:11:30.420 --> 2:11:35.420
 Einstein, Weinstein, Weinstein, Weinstein, that's what it is.

2:11:35.420 --> 2:11:38.140
 I get them confused with the brother.

2:11:38.140 --> 2:11:40.180
 The brothers care about stuff, the brother's wives.

2:11:40.180 --> 2:11:40.900
 And a few others.

2:11:40.900 --> 2:11:43.900
 I haven't ever listened to a full Joe Rogan episode.

2:11:43.900 --> 2:11:45.860
 But from what I've seen with him,

2:11:45.860 --> 2:11:48.380
 he has a preternatural curiosity.

2:11:48.380 --> 2:11:49.380
 He doesn't have passion.

2:11:49.380 --> 2:11:50.780
 There are a lot of podcasts that have passion.

2:11:50.780 --> 2:11:52.220
 Like, I've been on their show.

2:11:52.220 --> 2:11:53.020
 He has curiosity.

2:11:53.020 --> 2:11:55.300
 Like, he's not going to stop talking about something

2:11:55.300 --> 2:11:57.300
 until he hops it, until he understands it,

2:11:57.300 --> 2:11:59.340
 until he gets it viscerally.

2:11:59.340 --> 2:12:00.340
 And I respect that.

2:12:00.340 --> 2:12:02.940
 Because as I say in this more recent book,

2:12:02.940 --> 2:12:05.420
 passion's kind of like the dopamine hit

2:12:05.420 --> 2:12:07.700
 that gets you started, like, oh, I'm going to be great.

2:12:07.700 --> 2:12:08.820
 Maybe I can win a Nobel Prize.

2:12:08.820 --> 2:12:10.780
 Like, that's not going to sustain you.

2:12:10.780 --> 2:12:13.300
 The sustenance comes from the passion

2:12:13.300 --> 2:12:15.300
 converting to curiosity.

2:12:15.300 --> 2:12:18.300
 And what I want to do is convert as many things as possible

2:12:18.300 --> 2:12:20.180
 to things that I can then.

2:12:20.180 --> 2:12:24.060
 Because actually, I've had people that discuss addiction.

2:12:24.060 --> 2:12:27.740
 And there is an addictive quality to doing podcasts

2:12:27.740 --> 2:12:28.220
 or whatever.

2:12:28.220 --> 2:12:30.420
 But there's an addictive quality being a scientist.

2:12:30.420 --> 2:12:33.380
 And you get to do things that are very specialized

2:12:33.380 --> 2:12:36.180
 in specialized locations with special people,

2:12:36.180 --> 2:12:38.820
 paid for by other people who have no freaking idea what

2:12:38.820 --> 2:12:39.340
 you do.

2:12:39.340 --> 2:12:41.820
 I mean, imagine you worked in some job.

2:12:41.820 --> 2:12:44.780
 And Feynman said all these contradictory things.

2:12:44.780 --> 2:12:49.460
 Like, he said, if you can't explain it to your grandmother,

2:12:49.460 --> 2:12:50.980
 you don't understand it yourself.

2:12:50.980 --> 2:12:52.220
 Then the day you won the Nobel Prize,

2:12:52.220 --> 2:12:53.500
 a reporter asked him, what did you win it for?

2:12:53.500 --> 2:12:55.340
 He said, if I could explain it to you, bud,

2:12:55.340 --> 2:12:56.500
 it wouldn't be worth a Nobel Prize.

2:12:56.500 --> 2:12:58.940
 So let's leave aside his inherent contradictions.

2:12:58.940 --> 2:13:02.660
 But in reality, there is a kind of like dopamine rush

2:13:02.660 --> 2:13:03.540
 that you get from it.

2:13:03.540 --> 2:13:07.640
 But what is ultimately going to be the sustenance of it?

2:13:07.640 --> 2:13:12.500
 So yeah, I do feel like we have to find a way to nucleate that.

2:13:12.500 --> 2:13:14.860
 I don't know, actually, I don't know if it's like,

2:13:14.860 --> 2:13:16.820
 can you turn someone into a scientist?

2:13:16.820 --> 2:13:18.780
 I used to ask this question all the time.

2:13:18.780 --> 2:13:21.540
 Can you make someone creative?

2:13:21.540 --> 2:13:23.020
 Can you teach someone to be creative?

2:13:23.020 --> 2:13:23.900
 I don't know.

2:13:23.900 --> 2:13:26.420
 Can you teach someone to be curious?

2:13:26.420 --> 2:13:26.940
 I don't know.

2:13:26.940 --> 2:13:29.400
 I do know that kids are naturally curious.

2:13:29.400 --> 2:13:31.460
 As they get older, they get less curious.

2:13:31.460 --> 2:13:34.620
 Just like I heard from the other forward author, James

2:13:34.620 --> 2:13:37.980
 Altucher, he said, once they did a study,

2:13:37.980 --> 2:13:40.540
 kids smile 300 times a day, or smile or laugh.

2:13:40.540 --> 2:13:42.620
 Adults, five or six.

2:13:42.620 --> 2:13:43.380
 Five or six.

2:13:43.380 --> 2:13:45.620
 No, I'm trying to get you to laugh, but you're not going to laugh.

2:13:45.620 --> 2:13:46.660
 But anyway, no, it's true.

2:13:46.660 --> 2:13:49.020
 Somewhere you lose 30% to 50%.

2:13:49.020 --> 2:13:50.820
 I'm not entertained.

2:13:50.820 --> 2:13:52.460
 But that's because I'm an adult.

2:13:52.460 --> 2:13:54.980
 And then I do remember there's some distribution

2:13:54.980 --> 2:13:57.740
 in those studies with happier adults smile a little more,

2:13:57.740 --> 2:13:59.820
 but still the kids blow them out of the water.

2:13:59.820 --> 2:14:02.140
 Just crush it.

2:14:02.140 --> 2:14:04.180
 In other words, should we invest our energy

2:14:04.180 --> 2:14:07.300
 in getting the half life decay constant,

2:14:07.300 --> 2:14:09.660
 stretched out more for curiosity for kids?

2:14:09.660 --> 2:14:12.300
 Or should we try to reset the dopamine hit?

2:14:12.300 --> 2:14:13.500
 And then I don't know.

2:14:13.500 --> 2:14:14.380
 It's an open question.

2:14:14.380 --> 2:14:17.380
 Well, I think it goes to David Foster Wallace,

2:14:17.380 --> 2:14:19.300
 the key to life is to be unboreable.

2:14:19.300 --> 2:14:22.900
 I think you could train this kind of thing, which

2:14:22.900 --> 2:14:28.780
 is in every single situation, which I think is at the core,

2:14:28.780 --> 2:14:30.860
 at least this correlated with curiosity,

2:14:30.860 --> 2:14:36.720
 is in every situation, try to find the exciting,

2:14:36.720 --> 2:14:37.740
 the fascinating.

2:14:37.740 --> 2:14:38.860
 Like in every situation.

2:14:38.860 --> 2:14:40.980
 You sitting at the, I don't know,

2:14:40.980 --> 2:14:43.940
 waiting for something at a DMV or something like that.

2:14:43.940 --> 2:14:47.020
 Find something that excites you, like a thought.

2:14:47.020 --> 2:14:51.420
 Like watch people or start to think about, well,

2:14:51.420 --> 2:14:55.780
 I wonder how many people have to go to the DMV every day.

2:14:55.780 --> 2:14:59.700
 And then try to go into the pothead mode of thinking like,

2:14:59.700 --> 2:15:02.060
 wow, isn't this weird that there's a bunch of people

2:15:02.060 --> 2:15:05.500
 that are having to get a stamp of approval

2:15:05.500 --> 2:15:07.620
 from the government to drive their cars,

2:15:07.620 --> 2:15:09.500
 and then there's millions of cars driving every day.

2:15:09.500 --> 2:15:10.460
 Or like, how can I do this better?

2:15:10.460 --> 2:15:13.180
 Maybe there's some blockchain and they could like VIN transfer.

2:15:13.180 --> 2:15:13.860
 Yeah, exactly.

2:15:13.860 --> 2:15:14.360
 Yeah.

2:15:14.360 --> 2:15:15.660
 No, that is a good thing.

2:15:15.660 --> 2:15:18.000
 And then every situation, I think

2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:21.500
 if you rigorously just practice that at a young age,

2:15:21.500 --> 2:15:22.980
 I think you can learn to do that.

2:15:22.980 --> 2:15:26.220
 Because sometimes people ask me for advice

2:15:26.220 --> 2:15:29.780
 and to do this thing or that thing.

2:15:29.780 --> 2:15:31.580
 I think you, at the core, really have

2:15:31.580 --> 2:15:36.620
 to have this muscle of finding the awesomeness in everything.

2:15:36.620 --> 2:15:38.580
 Because if you're able to find the awesomeness

2:15:38.580 --> 2:15:40.940
 in everything, like whatever journey you take,

2:15:40.940 --> 2:15:47.340
 whatever weird meandering path that you take through life

2:15:47.340 --> 2:15:50.660
 is going to be productive, is going to end up in a great place.

2:15:50.660 --> 2:15:52.220
 So that muscle is at the core of it.

2:15:52.220 --> 2:15:58.220
 And I guess curiosity is central to that.

2:15:58.220 --> 2:16:02.180
 But you didn't win the Nobel Prize.

2:16:02.180 --> 2:16:05.660
 The team of Bicep that led the Bicep 2

2:16:05.660 --> 2:16:10.260
 didn't win the Nobel Prize because of some space dust.

2:16:10.260 --> 2:16:11.460
 That's right.

2:16:11.460 --> 2:16:13.940
 It's like schmutz.

2:16:13.940 --> 2:16:15.340
 Which one is the moon?

2:16:15.340 --> 2:16:16.060
 Which one is?

2:16:16.060 --> 2:16:17.820
 That one's dust.

2:16:17.820 --> 2:16:20.700
 Space dust, yeah.

2:16:20.700 --> 2:16:21.660
 What are we looking at?

2:16:21.660 --> 2:16:25.940
 So why is space dust the villain of this whole story?

2:16:25.940 --> 2:16:26.820
 Well, it's funny.

2:16:26.820 --> 2:16:27.900
 I wrote these books.

2:16:27.900 --> 2:16:29.700
 And I don't know about you, but when you get all these books,

2:16:29.700 --> 2:16:31.580
 I'm sure you get books, people sending books.

2:16:31.580 --> 2:16:33.460
 They always come in these dust jackets, right?

2:16:33.460 --> 2:16:35.460
 I was always like, what the hell is a dust jacket?

2:16:35.460 --> 2:16:38.220
 How much dust is raining down at any moment?

2:16:38.220 --> 2:16:39.260
 I mean, this is immaculate.

2:16:39.260 --> 2:16:41.500
 This room is Russian tidiness galore.

2:16:41.500 --> 2:16:44.220
 But in a normal household, how much dust is raining down?

2:16:44.220 --> 2:16:47.340
 It's not really pretty until I wrote a book.

2:16:47.340 --> 2:16:50.220
 And I realized I'm writing a story about the origin

2:16:50.220 --> 2:16:54.260
 of the universe, the prologue to the cosmos.

2:16:54.260 --> 2:16:58.180
 And dust is going to cover this story.

2:16:58.180 --> 2:17:01.820
 It's actually more a story about astrophysics and cosmology

2:17:01.820 --> 2:17:02.320
 than dust.

2:17:02.320 --> 2:17:05.620
 And this is the link between the cosmological and the

2:17:05.620 --> 2:17:06.300
 astrophysical.

2:17:06.300 --> 2:17:07.300
 So what does that mean?

2:17:07.300 --> 2:17:09.100
 So astrophysics is, broadly speaking,

2:17:09.100 --> 2:17:13.100
 the study of physical phenomena manifest in the heavens,

2:17:13.100 --> 2:17:14.820
 astronomical phenomena.

2:17:14.820 --> 2:17:17.200
 Cosmology is concerned with the origin, evolution,

2:17:17.200 --> 2:17:18.820
 composition of the universe as a whole.

2:17:18.820 --> 2:17:21.460
 But it's not really concerned with stars, galaxies,

2:17:21.460 --> 2:17:24.540
 and planets per se, other than how they might help us measure

2:17:24.540 --> 2:17:26.780
 the Hubble constant, the density of the universe,

2:17:26.780 --> 2:17:29.300
 the neutrino content, et cetera, et cetera.

2:17:29.300 --> 2:17:31.700
 So we have a tendency to kind of look a little bit,

2:17:31.700 --> 2:17:34.180
 you know, they're like, not all astronomers

2:17:34.180 --> 2:17:35.420
 and astrophysicists are equal.

2:17:35.420 --> 2:17:37.420
 They're all equal, but some are more equal than others.

2:17:37.420 --> 2:17:40.040
 So we have kind of a prejudice, a little swagger, right?

2:17:40.040 --> 2:17:42.380
 And cosmologists are studying, you know, we're using Einstein.

2:17:42.380 --> 2:17:44.420
 We're not using, like, you know, Boltzmann.

2:17:44.420 --> 2:17:46.880
 We're thinking of the biggest possible pictures.

2:17:46.880 --> 2:17:49.360
 In so doing, you can actually become

2:17:49.360 --> 2:17:52.840
 blinded to otherwise obvious effects

2:17:52.840 --> 2:17:55.980
 that people would have not overlooked.

2:17:55.980 --> 2:17:58.620
 In our case, when we sought out the signal,

2:17:58.620 --> 2:18:02.180
 we were using the photons that make up this primordial heat

2:18:02.180 --> 2:18:03.700
 bath that surrounds the universe,

2:18:03.700 --> 2:18:06.380
 luckily only at three degrees Kelvin approximately.

2:18:06.380 --> 2:18:08.260
 We're using those as a type of film

2:18:08.260 --> 2:18:11.220
 onto which gravitational waves will reverberate it,

2:18:11.220 --> 2:18:12.820
 make them oscillate preferentially

2:18:12.820 --> 2:18:14.180
 in a polarized way.

2:18:14.180 --> 2:18:16.140
 And then we can use our polarized sunglasses,

2:18:16.140 --> 2:18:18.860
 but in a microwave format, to detect

2:18:18.860 --> 2:18:20.520
 the characteristic twofold symmetry

2:18:20.520 --> 2:18:22.500
 pattern of underrotation.

2:18:22.500 --> 2:18:24.220
 That's the technical way that we undergo it.

2:18:24.220 --> 2:18:26.200
 I mean, there's a lot more to it.

2:18:26.200 --> 2:18:27.900
 But there are more than one thing

2:18:27.900 --> 2:18:29.580
 that can mimic exactly that signal.

2:18:29.580 --> 2:18:31.780
 First of all, when you look at the signal,

2:18:31.780 --> 2:18:34.240
 the signal if inflation took place, big if,

2:18:34.240 --> 2:18:36.580
 but if it took place, the signal would

2:18:36.580 --> 2:18:41.780
 be about one or two parts per billion of the CMB temperature

2:18:41.780 --> 2:18:43.140
 itself.

2:18:43.140 --> 2:18:45.460
 So a few nanokelvin.

2:18:45.460 --> 2:18:47.020
 The CMB is a few kelvin.

2:18:47.020 --> 2:18:50.540
 The signal from these B modes would be a few nanokelvin.

2:18:50.540 --> 2:18:52.180
 It's astonishing to think.

2:18:52.180 --> 2:18:54.700
 Penzias and Wilson, 1965, measured

2:18:54.700 --> 2:18:58.020
 something that's a billion times brighter.

2:18:58.020 --> 2:18:59.900
 And that was what, 60 years ago?

2:18:59.900 --> 2:19:02.540
 Let's call it 60 years ago, since they discovered it.

2:19:02.540 --> 2:19:04.340
 Moore's law, you're more expert now.

2:19:04.340 --> 2:19:05.980
 Let's call it every two years.

2:19:05.980 --> 2:19:09.180
 So you're talking about like 2 to the 30th power doubling

2:19:09.180 --> 2:19:10.660
 or something like that at that.

2:19:10.660 --> 2:19:12.740
 Let's call it 2 to the 20th, something like that.

2:19:12.740 --> 2:19:17.140
 So that's like only 2 to the 10th is 1,000.

2:19:17.140 --> 2:19:18.380
 Correct my math, I'm wrong.

2:19:18.380 --> 2:19:20.380
 2 to the 20th is a million.

2:19:20.380 --> 2:19:22.020
 2 to the 30th is a billion.

2:19:22.020 --> 2:19:25.780
 So we're outpacing Moore's law in terms

2:19:25.780 --> 2:19:27.500
 of the sensitivity of our instruments

2:19:27.500 --> 2:19:30.380
 to detect these feeble signals from the cosmos.

2:19:30.380 --> 2:19:31.860
 And they don't have to deal with,

2:19:31.860 --> 2:19:35.180
 in the semiconductor factory in Santa Clara, California,

2:19:35.180 --> 2:19:38.140
 they don't have to deal with meteorites and things

2:19:38.140 --> 2:19:39.780
 like coming into the laboratory.

2:19:39.780 --> 2:19:40.460
 It's a clean room.

2:19:40.460 --> 2:19:41.140
 It's pristine.

2:19:41.140 --> 2:19:42.780
 They can control everything about it.

2:19:42.780 --> 2:19:44.700
 We can't control the cosmos.

2:19:44.700 --> 2:19:46.420
 And the cosmos is literally littered

2:19:46.420 --> 2:19:50.540
 with particles of schmutz, of failed planets, asteroids,

2:19:50.540 --> 2:19:52.460
 meteoroids, things that didn't coalesce

2:19:52.460 --> 2:19:56.900
 to make either the Earth, the moon, the planet Jupiter,

2:19:56.900 --> 2:19:58.660
 or its moons, or get sucked into them

2:19:58.660 --> 2:20:00.980
 and make craters on them, et cetera, et cetera.

2:20:00.980 --> 2:20:04.260
 The rest of it is falling, and it comes in a power spectrum.

2:20:04.260 --> 2:20:07.820
 There's very few, thank god, Chicxulub sized impact

2:20:07.820 --> 2:20:11.900
 or progenitors that will take out all life on Earth.

2:20:11.900 --> 2:20:13.540
 But there's extremely large number

2:20:13.540 --> 2:20:16.580
 of tiny dust particles and microscopic grains.

2:20:16.580 --> 2:20:18.940
 And then there's a fair number of intermediate sized

2:20:18.940 --> 2:20:19.740
 particles.

2:20:19.740 --> 2:20:21.980
 And it turns out this little guy here

2:20:21.980 --> 2:20:26.900
 is the end product of a collapsing star that

2:20:26.900 --> 2:20:30.140
 explodes in what's called a supernova, type II supernova.

2:20:30.140 --> 2:20:31.860
 So stars spend most of their life

2:20:31.860 --> 2:20:39.180
 using helium nuclei protons and neutrons into helium nuclei.

2:20:39.180 --> 2:20:41.820
 And then from there, it can make other things like beryllium

2:20:41.820 --> 2:20:45.220
 and briefly make beryllium and carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,

2:20:45.220 --> 2:20:48.780
 all the way up until it tries to make iron and nickel.

2:20:48.780 --> 2:20:50.700
 And iron and nickel are endothermic.

2:20:50.700 --> 2:20:52.780
 It takes more energy than gets liberated

2:20:52.780 --> 2:20:55.900
 to make an atom of iron.

2:20:55.900 --> 2:20:58.740
 When that happens, there's no longer enough heat supplying

2:20:58.740 --> 2:21:01.420
 pressure to resist the gravitational collapse

2:21:01.420 --> 2:21:03.060
 of the material that was produced earlier.

2:21:03.060 --> 2:21:04.980
 So the star forms and goes inside out.

2:21:04.980 --> 2:21:07.460
 That's how scientists discovered helium

2:21:07.460 --> 2:21:08.580
 was discovered on the sun.

2:21:08.580 --> 2:21:08.940
 I don't know.

2:21:08.940 --> 2:21:09.300
 Did you know?

2:21:09.300 --> 2:21:10.660
 That's why it's called helium.

2:21:10.660 --> 2:21:12.060
 Yeah, they went there at night.

2:21:12.060 --> 2:21:14.780
 And they went there at night.

2:21:14.780 --> 2:21:16.780
 No, helium means Helios is the god of the sun.

2:21:16.780 --> 2:21:19.380
 It was discovered in its spectrum from observations

2:21:19.380 --> 2:21:20.980
 of the telescope like 150 years ago.

2:21:20.980 --> 2:21:25.580
 It wasn't discovered like when oxygen and iron was discovered.

2:21:25.580 --> 2:21:28.460
 So it's only a relatively recent comer to the pure activity.

2:21:28.460 --> 2:21:31.220
 So helium came after oxygen.

2:21:31.220 --> 2:21:33.460
 Oh, no, first hydrogen forms into helium.

2:21:33.460 --> 2:21:34.940
 So that's the first thing that formed.

2:21:34.940 --> 2:21:36.340
 No, in terms of discoveries.

2:21:36.340 --> 2:21:37.420
 Oh, yeah, after oxygen.

2:21:37.420 --> 2:21:41.100
 Yeah, I think Priestley and others, Dalton,

2:21:41.100 --> 2:21:42.660
 discovered it in the 1700s.

2:21:42.660 --> 2:21:44.300
 No, helium was really only discovered

2:21:44.300 --> 2:21:45.860
 from the spectrum of looking at the sun

2:21:45.860 --> 2:21:49.140
 and seeing the weird atomic absorption called Fraunhofer

2:21:49.140 --> 2:21:51.660
 lines in the solar spectrum.

2:21:51.660 --> 2:21:54.060
 But when it tries to make iron, there's

2:21:54.060 --> 2:21:55.580
 no longer any leftover heat.

2:21:55.580 --> 2:21:57.860
 In other words, there's heat left over from fusing,

2:21:57.860 --> 2:21:59.700
 as you know, the son of a plasma physicist.

2:21:59.700 --> 2:22:03.380
 You fuse to a hydrogen nuclei, you get excess energy,

2:22:03.380 --> 2:22:04.340
 plus you get helium.

2:22:04.340 --> 2:22:05.700
 So that's why fusion energy could

2:22:05.700 --> 2:22:08.420
 be the energy source of the future and always will be.

2:22:08.420 --> 2:22:09.260
 No, no, I don't know.

2:22:09.260 --> 2:22:11.420
 Hopefully, it'll come much sooner than that.

2:22:11.420 --> 2:22:13.940
 In so doing, trying to make iron, it takes more energy,

2:22:13.940 --> 2:22:16.740
 doesn't give off enough energy, star collapses, explodes.

2:22:16.740 --> 2:22:20.100
 And what does it spray out into the cosmic interstellar medium?

2:22:20.100 --> 2:22:22.820
 It sprays out the last thing it made, which is that stuff.

2:22:22.820 --> 2:22:24.540
 Luckily for us, because some of that

2:22:24.540 --> 2:22:26.820
 coalesced and made the core of the Earth,

2:22:26.820 --> 2:22:30.180
 onto which the lighter, like silica and carbon and the dirt

2:22:30.180 --> 2:22:31.820
 and the crust of the Earth were formed.

2:22:31.820 --> 2:22:33.660
 And some of that made its way to the crust.

2:22:33.660 --> 2:22:35.420
 The iron made its way to the crust.

2:22:35.420 --> 2:22:38.260
 Some of that your mother ate and synthesized

2:22:38.260 --> 2:22:39.540
 hemoglobin molecules.

2:22:39.540 --> 2:22:41.380
 And hemoglobin has iron particles in it.

2:22:41.380 --> 2:22:43.140
 It's a quite amazing substance.

2:22:43.140 --> 2:22:44.820
 Without it, we wouldn't have our red blood.

2:22:44.820 --> 2:22:47.380
 We wouldn't exist as we are.

2:22:47.380 --> 2:22:51.220
 Is this a very long, complicated mom joke?

2:22:51.220 --> 2:22:52.260
 I've done enough dad jokes.

2:22:52.260 --> 2:22:53.820
 My quota's up.

2:22:53.820 --> 2:22:58.220
 So taking this object seriously, not all of it

2:22:58.220 --> 2:22:59.260
 gets bound up in a planet.

2:22:59.260 --> 2:23:01.940
 In fact, forming planets is very inefficient.

2:23:01.940 --> 2:23:03.660
 And so there's a lot of schmutz left over,

2:23:03.660 --> 2:23:07.100
 some of which gets in the way of our telescopes looking back

2:23:07.100 --> 2:23:08.660
 to the beginning of time.

2:23:08.660 --> 2:23:10.420
 And some of those molecules, like iron,

2:23:10.420 --> 2:23:12.140
 is used in compass needles.

2:23:12.140 --> 2:23:13.380
 They're magnetized.

2:23:13.380 --> 2:23:15.660
 And magnetic fields in our galaxy

2:23:15.660 --> 2:23:18.140
 can align them and make the exact polarization pattern

2:23:18.140 --> 2:23:21.020
 that we're looking for, as if the compass needles get

2:23:21.020 --> 2:23:21.740
 all aligned.

2:23:21.740 --> 2:23:24.200
 That's like the polarization of the dust grain.

2:23:24.200 --> 2:23:26.260
 It's like that polarizing filter.

2:23:26.260 --> 2:23:29.060
 That means light polarized like this will get absorbed.

2:23:29.060 --> 2:23:30.900
 And light polarized like this will go through.

2:23:30.900 --> 2:23:31.700
 So it's absorbing.

2:23:31.700 --> 2:23:33.540
 It's making 100% polarized light out

2:23:33.540 --> 2:23:35.820
 of an initially unpolarized light source.

2:23:35.820 --> 2:23:36.900
 And that's what happened.

2:23:36.900 --> 2:23:43.460
 And what we ended up claiming on March 17, and I'm sure

2:23:43.460 --> 2:23:45.380
 if you were there, you might remember this.

2:23:45.380 --> 2:23:47.260
 At the Harvard Center for Astrophysics,

2:23:47.260 --> 2:23:48.300
 there was an announcement.

2:23:48.300 --> 2:23:50.260
 There were like three or four Nobel Prize winners

2:23:50.260 --> 2:23:50.980
 in the audience.

2:23:50.980 --> 2:23:53.660
 And the BICEP2 team, which I was no longer leading,

2:23:53.660 --> 2:23:55.100
 I was still a member of it.

2:23:55.100 --> 2:23:57.980
 In fact, in the announcement, the first person they mentioned,

2:23:57.980 --> 2:24:00.260
 besides thank you all for being here,

2:24:00.260 --> 2:24:02.500
 is me and my team at UC San Diego.

2:24:02.500 --> 2:24:05.220
 Although I wasn't invited to go to the press conference

2:24:05.220 --> 2:24:07.700
 because that was very complicated.

2:24:07.700 --> 2:24:09.380
 Yes, exactly.

2:24:09.380 --> 2:24:12.900
 It's a little school up there in the Cambridge area.

2:24:12.900 --> 2:24:15.540
 And so they ended up making this announcement

2:24:15.540 --> 2:24:18.220
 that we had discovered the aftershocks of inflation.

2:24:18.220 --> 2:24:21.900
 We detected the gravitational waves shaking up the CMB.

2:24:21.900 --> 2:24:24.600
 And on that day, past Lex Friedman's podcast

2:24:24.600 --> 2:24:26.620
 back when it was called Artificial Intelligence,

2:24:26.620 --> 2:24:29.220
 Max Tegmark said, goodbye, universe.

2:24:29.220 --> 2:24:30.300
 Hello, multiverse.

2:24:30.300 --> 2:24:32.380
 And hello, Nobel Prize.

2:24:32.380 --> 2:24:36.300
 He saw that as confirmatory evidence, not only of inflation,

2:24:36.300 --> 2:24:39.180
 not only of gravitational waves, but of the multiverse.

2:24:39.180 --> 2:24:40.340
 Goodbye, universe.

2:24:40.340 --> 2:24:41.780
 Hello, multiverse.

2:24:41.780 --> 2:24:44.460
 Multiverse is a natural consequence.

2:24:44.460 --> 2:24:46.260
 Consequence of inflation, yes.

2:24:46.260 --> 2:24:49.580
 According to its prominent supporters, yeah.

2:24:49.580 --> 2:24:51.900
 Yeah, and of course, leave the poetry to Max,

2:24:51.900 --> 2:24:54.220
 which he does masterfully.

2:24:54.220 --> 2:24:58.340
 OK, so the excitement was there.

2:24:58.340 --> 2:25:01.780
 I mean, maybe the initial heartbreak for you

2:25:01.780 --> 2:25:02.500
 was there, too.

2:25:02.500 --> 2:25:04.980
 That's some of the darker moments you're going through.

2:25:04.980 --> 2:25:07.860
 But broadly, for the space of science,

2:25:07.860 --> 2:25:09.060
 there's excitement there.

2:25:09.060 --> 2:25:09.860
 Huge excitement.

2:25:09.860 --> 2:25:13.500
 And I often note that this is a problem in what I call

2:25:13.500 --> 2:25:15.100
 the science media complex.

2:25:15.100 --> 2:25:17.860
 Because oftentimes, you'll see things like past guess

2:25:17.860 --> 2:25:21.500
 Sarah Seager, Venus life exist.

2:25:21.500 --> 2:25:23.820
 And that will be really, I mean, it's fascinating, right,

2:25:23.820 --> 2:25:26.580
 with the work that she's doing or her colleagues are doing,

2:25:26.580 --> 2:25:28.280
 Clara, who's on your show as well.

2:25:28.280 --> 2:25:31.660
 And that will be on front page, New York Times, Boston

2:25:31.660 --> 2:25:34.260
 Globe, San Diego Union Tribune.

2:25:34.260 --> 2:25:35.780
 It'll be above the fold.

2:25:35.780 --> 2:25:37.140
 Make headlines around the world.

2:25:37.140 --> 2:25:40.220
 And then six months, 12 months later, as is the case for us,

2:25:40.220 --> 2:25:41.220
 retraction.

2:25:41.220 --> 2:25:45.260
 Page C17 of the Saturday edition that nobody reads

2:25:45.260 --> 2:25:47.300
 and underneath the personal.

2:25:47.300 --> 2:25:52.740
 So we have a problem in science, that if it explodes, it leads.

2:25:52.740 --> 2:25:54.680
 And we get this huge fanfare.

2:25:54.680 --> 2:25:56.940
 And this is not unique to my experiment.

2:25:56.940 --> 2:25:58.620
 This happened with the earlier discovery

2:25:58.620 --> 2:26:02.220
 of so called Martian life discovered

2:26:02.220 --> 2:26:06.060
 in Antarctica, which was announced after peer review.

2:26:06.060 --> 2:26:07.640
 We weren't peer reviewed at the point

2:26:07.640 --> 2:26:08.500
 when we made the announcement.

2:26:08.500 --> 2:26:09.600
 We had a press conference.

2:26:09.600 --> 2:26:12.100
 And there are other reasons that the team leaders felt

2:26:12.100 --> 2:26:14.460
 it was important to do that so that we don't get scooped

2:26:14.460 --> 2:26:15.900
 by a referee who's unethical.

2:26:15.900 --> 2:26:17.180
 We thought we had done everything right,

2:26:17.180 --> 2:26:18.260
 but that's confirmation bias.

2:26:18.260 --> 2:26:20.020
 So there's levels to this.

2:26:20.020 --> 2:26:21.860
 Yeah, there were many levels.

2:26:21.860 --> 2:26:23.820
 And there were people, me warning

2:26:23.820 --> 2:26:25.200
 about how it would be interpreted

2:26:25.200 --> 2:26:28.260
 and wanting to also make sure that we put all the data out,

2:26:28.260 --> 2:26:30.380
 including the maps, which we still haven't released.

2:26:30.380 --> 2:26:33.120
 And so there were a lot of reasons to be skeptical.

2:26:33.120 --> 2:26:37.380
 But the public never knows this.

2:26:37.380 --> 2:26:39.380
 So I've made a rule that if I am ever

2:26:39.380 --> 2:26:43.020
 in charge of doling out large amounts of science funding,

2:26:43.020 --> 2:26:45.660
 that you should keep kind of an option.

2:26:45.660 --> 2:26:47.900
 In other words, you should have money for publicity.

2:26:47.900 --> 2:26:48.720
 It's fine.

2:26:48.720 --> 2:26:50.220
 Have money for your press conference.

2:26:50.220 --> 2:26:54.180
 But hold in reserve in a bond to be used, hopefully never,

2:26:54.180 --> 2:26:58.340
 but if it's to be used, an equal fund for the retraction,

2:26:58.340 --> 2:26:59.860
 if it should occur.

2:26:59.860 --> 2:27:01.700
 So you would like to see,

2:27:01.700 --> 2:27:04.820
 because that's a big part of transparency, is the...

2:27:06.180 --> 2:27:08.580
 To me, in the space of science at least,

2:27:08.580 --> 2:27:13.100
 that's as beautiful, because it reveals the...

2:27:13.100 --> 2:27:15.220
 It tells a great story.

2:27:15.220 --> 2:27:18.340
 There's an excitement, there's a...

2:27:18.340 --> 2:27:19.180
 Humanity.

2:27:20.060 --> 2:27:21.660
 So there's a climax to the triumph,

2:27:21.660 --> 2:27:25.420
 but there's also a climax to the disappointment at the end.

2:27:25.420 --> 2:27:29.540
 Because that also eventually leads to triumph again.

2:27:29.540 --> 2:27:32.540
 That sets up, that's the drama that sets up the triumph.

2:27:32.540 --> 2:27:37.180
 Like with Andrew Wiles performing Fermat's theorem,

2:27:37.180 --> 2:27:39.020
 I guess it's not the last thing, whatever.

2:27:41.060 --> 2:27:43.580
 Like the ups and downs of that, the rollercoaster,

2:27:43.580 --> 2:27:44.420
 the whole thing should be documented.

2:27:44.420 --> 2:27:45.260
 That is science.

2:27:45.260 --> 2:27:46.220
 That is science.

2:27:46.220 --> 2:27:49.020
 And when we don't do that, then we cultivate this aura

2:27:49.020 --> 2:27:51.060
 that excludes other scientists.

2:27:51.060 --> 2:27:53.140
 Often from minorities or women,

2:27:53.140 --> 2:27:54.460
 that you have to be Einstein.

2:27:54.460 --> 2:27:55.820
 Like Einstein came out of the womb,

2:27:55.820 --> 2:27:57.460
 and he was just like this guy with like curly...

2:27:57.460 --> 2:27:58.580
 No, he wasn't.

2:27:58.580 --> 2:28:00.220
 He wasn't bad at math.

2:28:00.220 --> 2:28:01.740
 That's all nonsense.

2:28:01.740 --> 2:28:02.900
 But he said that he...

2:28:02.900 --> 2:28:05.180
 You know what he said he attributed his success to, Lex?

2:28:05.180 --> 2:28:08.620
 He said, I never asked my dad what happened

2:28:08.620 --> 2:28:11.460
 when I ran alongside a light beam as a kid.

2:28:11.460 --> 2:28:12.420
 And thank God I didn't.

2:28:12.420 --> 2:28:13.380
 Because had I?

2:28:13.380 --> 2:28:15.620
 He would have told me the best answer of the day,

2:28:15.620 --> 2:28:18.900
 which by the way, he would create 20 years later

2:28:18.900 --> 2:28:21.500
 as a 26 year old in the patent office,

2:28:21.500 --> 2:28:22.740
 obviously in Switzerland.

2:28:22.740 --> 2:28:26.100
 And in so doing, by delaying when he asked these questions,

2:28:26.100 --> 2:28:28.660
 he said, I approached it with the intellect

2:28:28.660 --> 2:28:31.620
 of a mature scientist, not a little kid.

2:28:31.620 --> 2:28:34.100
 And I wouldn't have accepted the same explanation.

2:28:34.100 --> 2:28:37.300
 So sometimes assuming that scientists are infallible,

2:28:37.300 --> 2:28:40.220
 inevitable, omniscient being,

2:28:40.220 --> 2:28:41.620
 I think that really does a disservice.

2:28:41.620 --> 2:28:42.860
 And Jim Gates said, he's like,

2:28:42.860 --> 2:28:45.020
 Einstein wasn't always Einstein.

2:28:45.020 --> 2:28:47.980
 And we cultivate this mystery and allure at our peril

2:28:47.980 --> 2:28:51.740
 because we're humans until we have artificial Einstein,

2:28:51.740 --> 2:28:54.100
 which I don't think will ever exist.

2:28:54.100 --> 2:28:58.020
 You've launched the assay or project

2:28:58.020 --> 2:28:59.620
 where you hope to assess theories

2:28:59.620 --> 2:29:01.820
 of everything with experiments.

2:29:01.820 --> 2:29:03.860
 You have a YouTube video where you were announcing that.

2:29:03.860 --> 2:29:06.300
 That looks super cool.

2:29:06.300 --> 2:29:07.820
 Can you describe this project?

2:29:07.820 --> 2:29:09.060
 And you also mentioned kind of,

2:29:09.060 --> 2:29:11.940
 you give a shout out to a little known fellow

2:29:11.940 --> 2:29:14.300
 by the name of Galileo Galilei

2:29:14.300 --> 2:29:17.180
 as an inspiration to this project.

2:29:17.180 --> 2:29:20.340
 Yeah, so Galileo is kind of my avatar,

2:29:20.340 --> 2:29:23.060
 my hero, the kind of all around scientist

2:29:23.060 --> 2:29:27.620
 that I would love to approach the logarithm of Galileo.

2:29:27.620 --> 2:29:31.020
 He was not only a phenomenal scientist,

2:29:31.020 --> 2:29:35.380
 he was an incredible artist, a writer, a poet,

2:29:35.380 --> 2:29:38.260
 a philosopher, and back then they didn't have distinctions

2:29:38.260 --> 2:29:40.780
 between a scientist and a physician,

2:29:40.780 --> 2:29:41.820
 was like a physicist.

2:29:42.940 --> 2:29:46.220
 And he would indulge kind of these really

2:29:46.220 --> 2:29:48.180
 intellectual flights of fancy,

2:29:48.180 --> 2:29:52.500
 thinking about phenomena such as the Earth's tides

2:29:52.500 --> 2:29:55.300
 or the composition of the Milky Way.

2:29:55.300 --> 2:29:57.140
 And what's interesting about Galileo

2:29:57.140 --> 2:30:00.860
 is that he was almost as wrong often as he was right.

2:30:00.860 --> 2:30:03.500
 And Galileo was not alone like this.

2:30:03.500 --> 2:30:07.540
 I always say like Einstein had at least seven Nobel prizes

2:30:07.540 --> 2:30:09.380
 that he could have won for discoveries

2:30:09.380 --> 2:30:10.660
 that later became true,

2:30:10.660 --> 2:30:15.260
 but he also had seven huge impossible to believe blunders

2:30:15.260 --> 2:30:16.940
 in some sense.

2:30:16.940 --> 2:30:17.780
 That's too bad,

2:30:17.780 --> 2:30:19.500
 because he could have had a good career as I would say.

2:30:19.500 --> 2:30:21.300
 And Galileo was like that too.

2:30:21.300 --> 2:30:23.380
 In other words, he would fall victim

2:30:23.380 --> 2:30:25.980
 to I think this confirmation bias

2:30:25.980 --> 2:30:29.140
 that all scientists have to guard their lives against,

2:30:29.140 --> 2:30:32.020
 their careers, their brands, their reputations against,

2:30:32.020 --> 2:30:34.980
 which is the exclusion of evidence that doesn't conform

2:30:34.980 --> 2:30:38.380
 to what you're trying to prove for one reason or another,

2:30:38.380 --> 2:30:40.620
 or the radical acceptance of things

2:30:40.620 --> 2:30:43.740
 that do comport with it in order to bolster your confidence.

2:30:43.740 --> 2:30:45.620
 And both are equally intoxicating.

2:30:45.620 --> 2:30:49.300
 It's a confirmation bias is a hell of a drug

2:30:49.300 --> 2:30:53.060
 because it really reinforces this notion,

2:30:53.060 --> 2:30:54.540
 which is partially sunk cost.

2:30:54.540 --> 2:30:57.460
 You put so much time, effort, money, reputation into it.

2:30:57.460 --> 2:30:59.540
 You don't wanna be wrong and go back on it.

2:30:59.540 --> 2:31:04.540
 And with Galileo, he would be incredibly perceptive

2:31:04.940 --> 2:31:09.460
 about things such as the Earth being not located

2:31:09.460 --> 2:31:11.060
 at the center of the solar system

2:31:11.060 --> 2:31:12.420
 and the sun being the center,

2:31:12.420 --> 2:31:14.260
 the so called Copernican hypothesis.

2:31:15.220 --> 2:31:19.260
 And he would use as evidence very, very interesting ideas

2:31:19.260 --> 2:31:21.020
 that all of which were wrong, basically.

2:31:21.020 --> 2:31:22.940
 And in fact, we weren't able to prove

2:31:22.940 --> 2:31:25.140
 that the Earth orbited around the sun.

2:31:25.140 --> 2:31:28.460
 And I ask you, can you prove the Earth is not flat?

2:31:28.460 --> 2:31:30.140
 No, well, you're a flat earther anyway.

2:31:30.140 --> 2:31:31.940
 But I ask my practice.

2:31:31.940 --> 2:31:34.900
 Proud Flat Earth Society member,

2:31:34.900 --> 2:31:36.900
 T shirts coming out soon.

2:31:36.900 --> 2:31:38.340
 Let's stream it.com.

2:31:38.340 --> 2:31:39.180
 Merch.

2:31:39.180 --> 2:31:40.700
 Last merch.

2:31:40.700 --> 2:31:42.180
 But it's actually not trivial to do that.

2:31:42.180 --> 2:31:43.620
 But most of my students, graduate students

2:31:43.620 --> 2:31:45.140
 can prove that the Earth is round

2:31:45.140 --> 2:31:46.100
 or explain how the Earth.

2:31:46.100 --> 2:31:48.020
 It is actually not trivial to do though.

2:31:48.020 --> 2:31:48.860
 It's not.

2:31:48.860 --> 2:31:49.700
 Yeah.

2:31:49.700 --> 2:31:50.540
 And much harder is to prove

2:31:50.540 --> 2:31:51.660
 that the Earth goes around the sun.

2:31:51.660 --> 2:31:53.220
 In fact, that's extremely hard to prove.

2:31:53.220 --> 2:31:54.860
 And almost none of my students,

2:31:54.860 --> 2:31:57.260
 even after they get their PhD and the final exam,

2:31:57.260 --> 2:31:59.700
 I kinda like to just give them a little bit of humility.

2:31:59.700 --> 2:32:01.380
 Cause I think to be a good scientist,

2:32:01.380 --> 2:32:02.300
 you need to be humble.

2:32:02.300 --> 2:32:03.620
 You need to have a little humility

2:32:03.620 --> 2:32:05.140
 and you need to have swagger.

2:32:05.140 --> 2:32:06.460
 You need to feel like a little cocky.

2:32:06.460 --> 2:32:07.380
 Like I could do this.

2:32:07.380 --> 2:32:10.260
 I can do this thing that Einstein by definition couldn't do.

2:32:10.260 --> 2:32:11.340
 I'm gonna attempt it.

2:32:11.340 --> 2:32:13.620
 I'm gonna attempt to do what was impossible

2:32:13.620 --> 2:32:15.220
 just a generation ago.

2:32:15.220 --> 2:32:18.500
 How do you prove that the Earth goes around the sun?

2:32:18.500 --> 2:32:22.180
 Do you have to, is it by the motion of other planets?

2:32:22.180 --> 2:32:23.380
 So there are many ways to do it.

2:32:23.380 --> 2:32:24.820
 I mean, obviously you could take a spaceship,

2:32:24.820 --> 2:32:28.060
 park it at the North celestial pole of our solar system

2:32:28.060 --> 2:32:30.140
 and just watch what happens.

2:32:30.140 --> 2:32:31.820
 But obviously that wasn't how it was discovered

2:32:31.820 --> 2:32:32.860
 in the late 1700s.

2:32:32.860 --> 2:32:34.460
 So it was called aberration.

2:32:34.460 --> 2:32:36.660
 So if you look at stars,

2:32:36.660 --> 2:32:39.620
 as the Earth orbits around the sun,

2:32:39.620 --> 2:32:41.980
 the position of the stars will shift slightly

2:32:41.980 --> 2:32:43.300
 because of the tilt of the Earth

2:32:43.300 --> 2:32:45.340
 and because the Earth is in motion around the Earth

2:32:45.340 --> 2:32:46.700
 and around the sun.

2:32:46.700 --> 2:32:50.500
 And because the Earth has a non trivial amount of velocity

2:32:50.500 --> 2:32:53.700
 compared to the speed of light in its orbit around the sun,

2:32:53.700 --> 2:32:55.900
 the stars will trace out little tiny ellipses

2:32:55.900 --> 2:32:57.500
 and those will correspond to the fact

2:32:57.500 --> 2:32:59.180
 that we're moving around.

2:32:59.180 --> 2:33:00.580
 If they're infinite distance,

2:33:00.580 --> 2:33:02.180
 which we assume that they are, they're not really,

2:33:02.180 --> 2:33:03.740
 but for all intents and purposes

2:33:03.740 --> 2:33:06.100
 in the scale of the solar system, they're infinitely far away.

2:33:06.100 --> 2:33:08.140
 So that's called stellar aberration.

2:33:08.140 --> 2:33:10.580
 And that was the first way it was discovered.

2:33:10.580 --> 2:33:11.820
 And actually we still use that.

2:33:11.820 --> 2:33:13.260
 We have to correct for that effect

2:33:13.260 --> 2:33:16.060
 when we measure the cosmic microwave background.

2:33:16.060 --> 2:33:18.340
 Because imagine you're inside of an oven,

2:33:18.340 --> 2:33:19.780
 it has some temperature three Kelvin

2:33:19.780 --> 2:33:21.100
 and a thousand Kelvin whenever.

2:33:21.100 --> 2:33:22.740
 If you're moving towards you,

2:33:22.740 --> 2:33:24.500
 the photons that are coming to me in that direction

2:33:24.500 --> 2:33:26.140
 will be blue shifted hotter

2:33:26.140 --> 2:33:27.980
 and the ones behind me will be red shifted.

2:33:27.980 --> 2:33:30.860
 I'll artificially impute a greater or lesser amount

2:33:30.860 --> 2:33:32.620
 of matter or energy where you are

2:33:32.620 --> 2:33:34.780
 and it's an extension of the Doppler effect.

2:33:34.780 --> 2:33:36.460
 So we actually make use of that

2:33:36.460 --> 2:33:39.540
 and construct what's called like a local standard of rest.

2:33:39.540 --> 2:33:41.100
 Anyway, so you can do it.

2:33:41.100 --> 2:33:42.340
 But Galileo said, no, no, no,

2:33:42.340 --> 2:33:43.860
 I'm not gonna wait for that.

2:33:43.860 --> 2:33:45.780
 I have other proofs for it.

2:33:45.780 --> 2:33:47.780
 One of which is that the earth has tides

2:33:47.780 --> 2:33:50.100
 and the tides come in and out twice a day,

2:33:50.100 --> 2:33:51.420
 high tide and low tide.

2:33:51.420 --> 2:33:53.420
 And he made the analogy,

2:33:53.420 --> 2:33:56.180
 because the earth is moving around the sun,

2:33:56.180 --> 2:33:57.380
 say this is the sun here,

2:33:57.380 --> 2:33:58.860
 and it's moving around the sun,

2:33:58.860 --> 2:34:00.460
 but it's also rotating on its axis.

2:34:00.460 --> 2:34:02.380
 See how the water is sloshing up and down

2:34:02.380 --> 2:34:04.740
 inside the vodka bottle?

2:34:04.740 --> 2:34:05.660
 As that happens, he said,

2:34:05.660 --> 2:34:06.860
 that's what the tides are caused by.

2:34:06.860 --> 2:34:07.700
 Totally wrong.

2:34:07.700 --> 2:34:09.260
 Most people listen to this podcast.

2:34:09.260 --> 2:34:12.300
 Just so you know, if you're listening to this,

2:34:12.300 --> 2:34:14.780
 he actually has a bottle of vodka in his hand.

2:34:14.780 --> 2:34:15.820
 Half drunk.

2:34:15.820 --> 2:34:20.740
 And we're both drunk and whatever else is possible.

2:34:20.740 --> 2:34:22.180
 So as it sloshed around,

2:34:22.180 --> 2:34:23.020
 he claimed that was what,

2:34:23.020 --> 2:34:23.940
 no, it has nothing to do with that.

2:34:23.940 --> 2:34:26.420
 The moon, over there,

2:34:26.420 --> 2:34:28.700
 the moon pulls differentially

2:34:28.700 --> 2:34:30.660
 on the earth and the earth's ocean.

2:34:30.660 --> 2:34:33.060
 That causes the oceans to bulge slightly

2:34:33.060 --> 2:34:35.020
 towards and away from where the moon is.

2:34:35.020 --> 2:34:37.420
 And the moon is actually the source of the earth's tides.

2:34:37.420 --> 2:34:39.620
 It has nothing to do with Copernicus,

2:34:39.620 --> 2:34:40.660
 the orbit of the sun.

2:34:40.660 --> 2:34:42.420
 So he was totally wrong about that.

2:34:42.420 --> 2:34:44.540
 He also thought that the Milky Way

2:34:44.540 --> 2:34:46.180
 was comprised only of stars,

2:34:46.180 --> 2:34:47.900
 when we know it's made of gas, dust,

2:34:47.900 --> 2:34:49.740
 nebulae, and things like that.

2:34:49.740 --> 2:34:51.220
 So he had his fair share of blunders.

2:34:51.220 --> 2:34:53.620
 Now, one thing I always kind of make note of,

2:34:53.620 --> 2:34:57.420
 and I'm actually producing along with Jim Gates,

2:34:57.420 --> 2:35:00.460
 Fabiola Gianatti, Frank Wilczek,

2:35:00.460 --> 2:35:02.420
 and Carlo Ravelli,

2:35:02.420 --> 2:35:03.980
 and my friend Lucio Piccirillo,

2:35:03.980 --> 2:35:07.220
 the first ever audio book of Galileo's dialogue,

2:35:07.220 --> 2:35:08.980
 the one where he claimed to find evidence

2:35:08.980 --> 2:35:11.140
 for the orbit of the earth around the sun,

2:35:11.140 --> 2:35:12.580
 but it was an error.

2:35:12.580 --> 2:35:14.700
 So you're reading parts of this text.

2:35:14.700 --> 2:35:16.500
 Yeah, it's a brilliant book.

2:35:16.500 --> 2:35:19.260
 So this book was written in 1632.

2:35:19.260 --> 2:35:20.700
 It was written, and it was the one

2:35:20.700 --> 2:35:22.340
 that caused him to go into house arrest

2:35:22.340 --> 2:35:24.500
 and almost threatened to be tortured.

2:35:24.500 --> 2:35:27.500
 And that book laid out his arguments

2:35:27.500 --> 2:35:29.460
 for what was called the Copernican

2:35:29.460 --> 2:35:33.860
 or the nonparapathetic Aristotelian, et cetera,

2:35:33.860 --> 2:35:37.140
 notion of the planetary dynamic.

2:35:37.140 --> 2:35:39.780
 And eventually he was forced to recant

2:35:39.780 --> 2:35:40.700
 that he believed in it,

2:35:40.700 --> 2:35:43.740
 and allegedly he said he still believes the earth moves.

2:35:43.740 --> 2:35:44.900
 Anyway, so we're making,

2:35:44.900 --> 2:35:46.300
 it's written in the form of a trilogue.

2:35:46.300 --> 2:35:48.700
 It's actually called the dialogue with his three people.

2:35:48.700 --> 2:35:50.380
 There's one named Salviati,

2:35:50.380 --> 2:35:53.140
 who was espousing Galileo's notions

2:35:53.140 --> 2:35:54.860
 about how the heavens were orchestrated.

2:35:54.860 --> 2:35:58.220
 And Salviati means like the salvation, the savior.

2:35:58.220 --> 2:35:59.980
 Then there's a middleman, Segredo.

2:35:59.980 --> 2:36:04.140
 So Carlo Rovelli is playing Salviati, brilliant one.

2:36:04.140 --> 2:36:05.540
 I am playing Segredo,

2:36:05.540 --> 2:36:07.740
 who's like an intelligent interlocutor.

2:36:07.740 --> 2:36:10.740
 I'm kind of just, I can appreciate Aristotle,

2:36:10.740 --> 2:36:12.380
 I can appreciate Copernicus.

2:36:12.380 --> 2:36:15.260
 Then there's this guy, Simplicio, the simpleton,

2:36:15.260 --> 2:36:18.260
 and he espouses the words of the Pope.

2:36:18.260 --> 2:36:19.620
 So you can imagine like,

2:36:19.620 --> 2:36:21.700
 you're working in Putin's government

2:36:21.700 --> 2:36:23.580
 or you're working in whatever,

2:36:23.580 --> 2:36:27.020
 and all of a sudden you're kind of putting the words

2:36:27.020 --> 2:36:29.820
 of like the fool, literally calling the fool,

2:36:29.820 --> 2:36:30.780
 but you're using the words

2:36:30.780 --> 2:36:33.860
 of the all supreme powerful being on earth at that time

2:36:33.860 --> 2:36:35.300
 was the Vatican church,

2:36:35.300 --> 2:36:37.300
 especially for an Italian like Galileo.

2:36:37.300 --> 2:36:41.020
 So he wasn't as brilliant politically

2:36:41.020 --> 2:36:44.180
 as he was astrophysically and otherwise.

2:36:44.180 --> 2:36:46.580
 Who's doing Simplicio?

2:36:46.580 --> 2:36:49.780
 Simplicio is a friend of mine in University of Manchester

2:36:49.780 --> 2:36:51.540
 named Lucio Picciarello.

2:36:51.540 --> 2:36:53.300
 He's an Irish guy, but he has an Italian,

2:36:53.300 --> 2:36:55.420
 no, no, he's a full blooded Italian.

2:36:55.420 --> 2:36:58.580
 They all speak English and Italian, I only speak,

2:36:58.580 --> 2:37:00.420
 and the four words are written by,

2:37:00.420 --> 2:37:03.660
 so one four word in this place has three four words,

2:37:03.660 --> 2:37:04.940
 which is like a 12 word.

2:37:06.700 --> 2:37:07.540
 Okay.

2:37:07.540 --> 2:37:08.380
 The four words are written by.

2:37:08.380 --> 2:37:09.220
 Can you explain that joke for me?

2:37:09.220 --> 2:37:10.260
 Yeah, that was a good one.

2:37:10.260 --> 2:37:12.580
 The four word, three four words.

2:37:12.580 --> 2:37:14.540
 One of them is written by Albert Einstein

2:37:14.540 --> 2:37:17.740
 in which he says Galileo was not only

2:37:17.740 --> 2:37:19.220
 one of the greatest scientists in history,

2:37:19.220 --> 2:37:21.740
 this is Einstein telling Galileo,

2:37:21.740 --> 2:37:23.860
 but he was one of the greatest writers

2:37:23.860 --> 2:37:26.420
 and minds of all of human history.

2:37:26.420 --> 2:37:29.540
 That four word is read by Frank Wilczek, who you've had.

2:37:30.580 --> 2:37:31.700
 Jim Gates, who you've also had,

2:37:31.700 --> 2:37:35.100
 he reads the translation, the translator,

2:37:35.100 --> 2:37:38.900
 Stillman Drake, who's a renowned scientific translator.

2:37:38.900 --> 2:37:40.820
 And then Fabiola Giannati,

2:37:40.820 --> 2:37:43.940
 she reads the introduction and dedication

2:37:43.940 --> 2:37:46.780
 from Galileo to the Duke of Tuscany

2:37:46.780 --> 2:37:49.380
 and some of the different introductions

2:37:49.380 --> 2:37:50.620
 that Galileo himself had.

2:37:50.620 --> 2:37:53.060
 It's just, it's such a thrill to be able to do it.

2:37:53.060 --> 2:37:54.380
 I only randomly found out,

2:37:54.380 --> 2:37:58.220
 cause I wanted to study it and it's like 500 pages long.

2:37:58.220 --> 2:37:59.420
 And I was like, let me get the audio book

2:37:59.420 --> 2:38:02.020
 cause I'm an audio medium kind of guy, didn't exist.

2:38:02.020 --> 2:38:03.660
 So I said, let's do it ourselves.

2:38:03.660 --> 2:38:05.420
 And so we did it and hopefully it'll be out

2:38:05.420 --> 2:38:09.460
 on Galileo's birthday, which is February 15th, 2022.

2:38:09.460 --> 2:38:11.580
 There'll be a ripe 457,

2:38:11.580 --> 2:38:13.500
 but that's not the only one of his books.

2:38:13.500 --> 2:38:14.780
 Galileo wrote many books,

2:38:15.660 --> 2:38:18.020
 one of which is called the Military Compass.

2:38:18.020 --> 2:38:20.620
 And this is an interesting book for my blockchain

2:38:20.620 --> 2:38:22.620
 and your blockchain aficionados.

2:38:22.620 --> 2:38:24.980
 In this book, he talks about a compass,

2:38:24.980 --> 2:38:26.500
 which is not a magnetic compass,

2:38:26.500 --> 2:38:27.940
 but an actual like slide roll.

2:38:27.940 --> 2:38:29.500
 It's basically a slide roll.

2:38:29.500 --> 2:38:31.500
 And it's a manual.

2:38:31.500 --> 2:38:34.060
 It's like, imagine if your phone came with a manual,

2:38:34.060 --> 2:38:35.100
 nowadays they don't, right?

2:38:35.100 --> 2:38:38.140
 But this was a manual for how to use this slide roll,

2:38:38.140 --> 2:38:39.820
 which is like enormously important.

2:38:39.820 --> 2:38:41.900
 And he gives a whole bunch of worked examples.

2:38:41.900 --> 2:38:43.140
 It's a brilliant book.

2:38:43.140 --> 2:38:45.460
 One of the examples is how do you convert money?

2:38:45.460 --> 2:38:47.540
 So he does a currency conversion

2:38:47.540 --> 2:38:50.820
 between Ducati and Florentine Ducati

2:38:50.820 --> 2:38:54.020
 and Scuti and whatever, you know, lira, whatever.

2:38:54.020 --> 2:38:55.940
 He does all these currency conversions.

2:38:55.940 --> 2:38:58.940
 One copy of this book, or maybe two exist,

2:38:58.940 --> 2:39:02.220
 first printings from 1600 still exist.

2:39:02.220 --> 2:39:06.100
 If Galileo had just kept those in his family,

2:39:06.100 --> 2:39:08.740
 they're worth a hundred million dollars.

2:39:08.740 --> 2:39:10.180
 Nowadays, you can't get a Scuti.

2:39:10.180 --> 2:39:11.460
 A Scuti is worth nothing.

2:39:11.460 --> 2:39:13.060
 Like a Ducati is worth nothing.

2:39:13.060 --> 2:39:15.340
 I mean, maybe some collector wants a piece of paper, right?

2:39:15.340 --> 2:39:16.180
 So it's a lesson.

2:39:16.180 --> 2:39:18.780
 Like there are value in physical, you know,

2:39:18.780 --> 2:39:22.500
 nonfungible tokens, this original nonfungible token.

2:39:22.500 --> 2:39:24.500
 But then a third book is called the assayer.

2:39:24.500 --> 2:39:26.420
 So what is an assayer?

2:39:26.420 --> 2:39:29.020
 So assayers were kind of like these alchemists, you know,

2:39:29.020 --> 2:39:33.020
 physicists, chemists that would be around a court.

2:39:33.020 --> 2:39:35.300
 And every so often for the treasurer,

2:39:35.300 --> 2:39:37.860
 they would want to accept pieces of gold from the citizens

2:39:37.860 --> 2:39:40.780
 and convert that to script or, you know, paper money.

2:39:40.780 --> 2:39:42.500
 And to do that, they needed someone

2:39:42.500 --> 2:39:44.740
 to verify with a standard of gold

2:39:44.740 --> 2:39:47.540
 that they knew to be gold and do some kind

2:39:47.540 --> 2:39:49.740
 of semi non destructive evaluation

2:39:49.740 --> 2:39:51.900
 of the purported object, the metal that

2:39:51.900 --> 2:39:53.220
 was supposed to be gold.

2:39:53.220 --> 2:39:56.420
 So they would take these pieces of gold, theoretically gold,

2:39:56.420 --> 2:39:59.180
 and they would rub it on something called a touchstone.

2:39:59.180 --> 2:40:01.820
 Touchstone was a special piece of rock, granite, whatever.

2:40:01.820 --> 2:40:04.020
 It has no intrinsic value.

2:40:04.020 --> 2:40:05.140
 It's just a piece of rock.

2:40:05.140 --> 2:40:08.740
 But with that rock, you could assay and determine

2:40:08.740 --> 2:40:11.420
 the content of this thing that could be worth, you know,

2:40:11.420 --> 2:40:13.300
 millions of lira or whatever, right?

2:40:13.300 --> 2:40:15.100
 So it was an incredibly important job.

2:40:15.100 --> 2:40:18.780
 And so this person would take this piece of inanimate rock

2:40:18.780 --> 2:40:20.740
 and use it to do something valuable.

2:40:20.740 --> 2:40:22.780
 What I want to do in the Assayer Project

2:40:22.780 --> 2:40:26.460
 is take this plethora of physical theories

2:40:26.460 --> 2:40:27.020
 of everything.

2:40:27.020 --> 2:40:29.660
 I said recently, you know, we should give a Nobel Prize

2:40:29.660 --> 2:40:32.380
 to someone who doesn't come up with a theory of everything.

2:40:32.380 --> 2:40:37.340
 Because there's just like, it's just rotten with them.

2:40:37.340 --> 2:40:39.100
 And I think it's great.

2:40:39.100 --> 2:40:42.980
 You know, I often say that theory is kind of like software.

2:40:42.980 --> 2:40:44.740
 And I'm not denigrating software at all.

2:40:44.740 --> 2:40:46.540
 But like, you can create a lot of software.

2:40:46.540 --> 2:40:49.380
 You can make a quine, and it'll make its own quine.

2:40:49.380 --> 2:40:51.300
 And you can make infinite amounts of software.

2:40:51.300 --> 2:40:52.460
 Look it up, kids.

2:40:52.460 --> 2:40:54.340
 That's one of my favorite videos.

2:40:54.340 --> 2:40:55.260
 And you can replicate.

2:40:55.260 --> 2:40:55.900
 You can't replicate.

2:40:55.900 --> 2:40:57.780
 You can't make a telescope that makes a telescope that

2:40:57.780 --> 2:40:58.540
 makes a telescope.

2:40:58.540 --> 2:41:01.020
 In other words, hardware's kind of like the nonfungible token

2:41:01.020 --> 2:41:03.460
 that's the ultimate minted, limited edition, the book,

2:41:03.460 --> 2:41:05.420
 the compass book, like I talk.

2:41:05.420 --> 2:41:07.420
 And so it's very expensive.

2:41:07.420 --> 2:41:10.300
 That means you have to be very careful before you invest

2:41:10.300 --> 2:41:14.140
 decades, billions, and humans into pursuing

2:41:14.140 --> 2:41:15.700
 one of these theories of everything.

2:41:15.700 --> 2:41:17.940
 You have to have good intuition for it.

2:41:17.940 --> 2:41:21.180
 And lately, what I've seen is not predictions,

2:41:21.180 --> 2:41:22.920
 but retrodictions.

2:41:22.920 --> 2:41:25.580
 So you see that the Large Hadron Collider will come out

2:41:25.580 --> 2:41:26.780
 with a measurement.

2:41:26.780 --> 2:41:30.260
 And then so and so will say, oh, this

2:41:30.260 --> 2:41:32.100
 is compatible with string theory.

2:41:32.100 --> 2:41:35.460
 Or g minus 2 of the muon, it has these bizarre properties.

2:41:35.460 --> 2:41:38.700
 Fifth force, string theory predicts this.

2:41:38.700 --> 2:41:40.860
 String theory solves this.

2:41:40.860 --> 2:41:46.020
 Neutrinos, sterile neutrinos, Large Hadron Collider bottom

2:41:46.020 --> 2:41:47.820
 or B experiment, blah, blah, blah.

2:41:47.820 --> 2:41:50.060
 They'll say that it's compatible after the fact.

2:41:50.060 --> 2:41:51.300
 And it's not so bad, right?

2:41:51.300 --> 2:41:54.980
 Because what did Einstein do with GR, general relativity?

2:41:54.980 --> 2:41:58.180
 The first thing he did was not predict something new.

2:41:58.180 --> 2:41:59.900
 He looked at the anomalous behavior

2:41:59.900 --> 2:42:01.400
 of the planet Mercury.

2:42:01.400 --> 2:42:03.480
 And he saw it was behaving strangely.

2:42:03.480 --> 2:42:05.940
 And people had said, oh, that's because there's another planet

2:42:05.940 --> 2:42:08.740
 hiding behind the sun that we can't see that perturbs

2:42:08.740 --> 2:42:10.220
 the orbit of the planet Mercury.

2:42:10.220 --> 2:42:12.020
 It's called Vulcan.

2:42:12.020 --> 2:42:13.020
 That was one approach.

2:42:13.020 --> 2:42:14.780
 That's kind of like the dark matter approach,

2:42:14.780 --> 2:42:16.540
 where it's like there's a clump of matter

2:42:16.540 --> 2:42:19.380
 that we can't see that's influencing the planet that we

2:42:19.380 --> 2:42:20.300
 can't see.

2:42:20.300 --> 2:42:22.820
 And we use that to divine and intuit the existence

2:42:22.820 --> 2:42:23.700
 of the other planet.

2:42:23.700 --> 2:42:25.520
 That's actually how Neptune was discovered.

2:42:25.520 --> 2:42:27.900
 Neptune was discovered because of the anomalous behavior

2:42:27.900 --> 2:42:29.180
 of the planet Uranus.

2:42:29.180 --> 2:42:30.160
 So Neptune was dark.

2:42:30.160 --> 2:42:30.980
 We couldn't see it.

2:42:30.980 --> 2:42:33.100
 It was tugging on Uranus in a certain way.

2:42:33.100 --> 2:42:36.060
 And that led to Le Verrier discovering the planet,

2:42:36.060 --> 2:42:38.380
 predicting where this planet should be found.

2:42:38.380 --> 2:42:40.540
 So it had a good heritage in physics

2:42:40.540 --> 2:42:43.180
 to predict this planet that you couldn't see that worked.

2:42:43.180 --> 2:42:45.300
 But Einstein said, no, it's caused

2:42:45.300 --> 2:42:47.700
 by the warping and bending of spacetime

2:42:47.700 --> 2:42:50.580
 due to the presence of matter, who will later become known

2:42:50.580 --> 2:42:51.660
 as the Einstein equations.

2:42:51.660 --> 2:42:54.380
 So he explained why Mercury did that.

2:42:54.380 --> 2:42:55.980
 And it was known since the time of Newton

2:42:55.980 --> 2:42:58.700
 that Mercury was behaving in this really freaky way.

2:42:58.700 --> 2:42:59.660
 So he didn't predict it.

2:42:59.660 --> 2:43:00.620
 He retradicted it.

2:43:00.620 --> 2:43:01.500
 That's fine.

2:43:01.500 --> 2:43:03.180
 But at some point, you should come up

2:43:03.180 --> 2:43:05.140
 with something new that's uniquely

2:43:05.140 --> 2:43:07.300
 predictive of your theory, as I just said.

2:43:07.300 --> 2:43:09.960
 The theory of dark matter in the context of Neptune

2:43:09.960 --> 2:43:11.060
 is actually a valid theory.

2:43:11.060 --> 2:43:12.340
 It just happens not to make sense

2:43:12.340 --> 2:43:14.620
 in the context of Vulcan.

2:43:14.620 --> 2:43:17.860
 And so if he had kept doing that,

2:43:17.860 --> 2:43:19.920
 maybe perhaps he wouldn't have come up

2:43:19.920 --> 2:43:22.700
 with these other predictions that he would later reject.

2:43:22.700 --> 2:43:24.980
 He rejected the existence of gravitational waves.

2:43:24.980 --> 2:43:26.660
 You and Barry talked about that.

2:43:26.660 --> 2:43:27.540
 He didn't actually believe it.

2:43:27.540 --> 2:43:29.860
 It was the one peer reviewed paper that he had.

2:43:29.860 --> 2:43:31.340
 He used to send back in those days.

2:43:31.340 --> 2:43:33.580
 He'd send a letter to Nature, physical review,

2:43:33.580 --> 2:43:36.900
 publish this, and know how much it cost.

2:43:36.900 --> 2:43:37.860
 And he got it rejected,

2:43:37.860 --> 2:43:40.260
 because he said you can't detect gravitational waves.

2:43:40.260 --> 2:43:41.900
 And actually, or they're not real.

2:43:41.900 --> 2:43:43.020
 And the guy showed that they're real,

2:43:43.020 --> 2:43:45.020
 because he corrected a math error

2:43:45.020 --> 2:43:47.220
 in Einstein and Rosen's paper.

2:43:47.220 --> 2:43:48.060
 So it's fascinating.

2:43:48.060 --> 2:43:49.940
 What should the assayer do?

2:43:49.940 --> 2:43:52.460
 He or she should look at these theories,

2:43:52.460 --> 2:43:54.660
 look what things they explain that already exist,

2:43:54.660 --> 2:43:58.900
 and look at what new predictions they can claim to explain

2:43:58.900 --> 2:44:01.940
 if we can build experiments to test them.

2:44:01.940 --> 2:44:03.180
 So you have to kind of challenge yourself

2:44:03.180 --> 2:44:06.140
 to think about what kind of predictions

2:44:06.140 --> 2:44:09.500
 can they make such that we can construct experiments?

2:44:09.500 --> 2:44:14.420
 So that's like ultimately back going to the signal,

2:44:14.420 --> 2:44:19.220
 to the experimenter's theorist, essentially.

2:44:19.220 --> 2:44:24.140
 So like very experiment centric exploration

2:44:24.140 --> 2:44:25.980
 of the fundamental theory of everything.

2:44:25.980 --> 2:44:26.820
 That's right.

2:44:26.820 --> 2:44:29.060
 And the best scientists, the best physicists,

2:44:29.060 --> 2:44:31.860
 were both experimentalists and theorists.

2:44:31.860 --> 2:44:34.380
 Or at least if they were experimentalists,

2:44:34.380 --> 2:44:37.460
 they understood the theory well enough to make predictions

2:44:37.460 --> 2:44:38.620
 or to explore the predictions

2:44:38.620 --> 2:44:40.940
 and the consequences of those predictions.

2:44:40.940 --> 2:44:43.260
 Or if they were theorists, they were like Galileo.

2:44:43.260 --> 2:44:46.060
 Like Einstein has patents for things that he invented.

2:44:47.140 --> 2:44:50.260
 And then some of his work led to the laser and the maser.

2:44:50.260 --> 2:44:52.940
 So he had practically, it wasn't just pure airy fairy,

2:44:52.940 --> 2:44:55.300
 quantum reality and expanding universe.

2:44:56.260 --> 2:44:58.580
 So in this case, what I wanna do is look at,

2:44:58.580 --> 2:45:00.100
 there's 10 different theories of everything

2:45:00.100 --> 2:45:01.580
 or cosmological models.

2:45:01.580 --> 2:45:03.260
 They make predictions, they have advantages

2:45:03.260 --> 2:45:05.620
 and disadvantages, and I'm just asking the question,

2:45:05.620 --> 2:45:07.900
 why aren't we applying Bayesian reasoning

2:45:07.900 --> 2:45:09.060
 with confidence intervals?

2:45:09.060 --> 2:45:10.100
 Why don't we have updates?

2:45:10.100 --> 2:45:12.020
 Every time an experiment comes out,

2:45:12.020 --> 2:45:14.260
 we can update our credulity in that experiment

2:45:14.260 --> 2:45:15.380
 or that theory rather,

2:45:15.380 --> 2:45:17.260
 based on the results of the experiment.

2:45:17.260 --> 2:45:18.980
 And we shouldn't do it after the fact,

2:45:18.980 --> 2:45:20.980
 or as Michio Kaku has said,

2:45:20.980 --> 2:45:23.980
 well, you have to tell me what the initial conditions are.

2:45:23.980 --> 2:45:24.900
 And that's not my job.

2:45:24.900 --> 2:45:26.820
 You're supposed to tell me if string theory is correct,

2:45:26.820 --> 2:45:29.500
 what should it predict if it's true?

2:45:29.500 --> 2:45:31.700
 There's one big problem, which I should say,

2:45:31.700 --> 2:45:34.420
 that to be a good ass air,

2:45:34.420 --> 2:45:39.420
 I think you have to be worldly in the sense of,

2:45:40.420 --> 2:45:42.780
 worldly and curious, like we were talking about before

2:45:42.780 --> 2:45:47.540
 with you and Joe, and you can't only talk your own book.

2:45:47.540 --> 2:45:52.340
 You can't only understand your own pet theory of everything.

2:45:52.340 --> 2:45:55.900
 You can't only say, well, I only understand string theory

2:45:55.900 --> 2:45:58.500
 and I don't have time for these other theories,

2:45:58.500 --> 2:46:02.820
 or as if it's beneath me to even go into Garrett Lisi

2:46:02.820 --> 2:46:05.300
 or Eric Weinstein or Stephen Wolfram

2:46:05.300 --> 2:46:08.100
 or aspects of M theory, et cetera, et cetera.

2:46:08.100 --> 2:46:09.900
 And there are some that say,

2:46:09.900 --> 2:46:14.900
 why do we give string theory so much of an advanced pass

2:46:15.980 --> 2:46:18.380
 when there are actually predictions that's made

2:46:18.380 --> 2:46:21.660
 that are completely anathema to what we observe in physics?

2:46:21.660 --> 2:46:24.020
 Like the dark energy should be negative

2:46:24.020 --> 2:46:25.500
 and we see it as positive.

2:46:25.500 --> 2:46:26.540
 That's a huge strike.

2:46:26.540 --> 2:46:28.940
 If you told somebody, here's my tenure application

2:46:28.940 --> 2:46:30.380
 and what do you, oh, I've made this pretty,

2:46:30.380 --> 2:46:33.860
 if it wasn't done by Maldacena and Whitten

2:46:33.860 --> 2:46:34.820
 and folks like that,

2:46:34.820 --> 2:46:36.980
 I don't know if it would have had the traction,

2:46:36.980 --> 2:46:38.980
 the endurance, the resiliency that it's had.

2:46:38.980 --> 2:46:42.820
 And that worries me because all these men and some women

2:46:42.820 --> 2:46:46.180
 are making these fantastic, brilliant, beautiful ideas

2:46:46.180 --> 2:46:48.580
 and they're not even looking at what their neighbor's doing.

2:46:48.580 --> 2:46:52.020
 There's a thing that I really enjoyed seeing

2:46:52.020 --> 2:46:54.620
 and that don't see often enough with these theories,

2:46:54.620 --> 2:46:58.260
 which is others who are also experts

2:46:58.260 --> 2:47:01.740
 kind of studying them sufficiently well

2:47:01.740 --> 2:47:04.100
 to steel man the theory,

2:47:04.100 --> 2:47:06.580
 to show the beautiful aspects of the theory.

2:47:07.740 --> 2:47:09.900
 I see that with Stephen Wolfram.

2:47:09.900 --> 2:47:14.900
 He has a very different sort of formulation of physics

2:47:15.220 --> 2:47:17.180
 with his physics project.

2:47:17.180 --> 2:47:21.420
 Now I'm, it's, physics is a foreign land to me,

2:47:21.420 --> 2:47:24.820
 but his formulation, especially in the context

2:47:24.820 --> 2:47:27.060
 of cellular automata or hypergraphs,

2:47:27.060 --> 2:47:29.820
 just as objects, as mathematical objects themselves

2:47:29.820 --> 2:47:30.780
 are familiar.

2:47:30.780 --> 2:47:33.540
 And so I'm able to see the real beauty there

2:47:33.540 --> 2:47:38.540
 and it saddens me that others in the physics community

2:47:39.060 --> 2:47:41.220
 can't also see the beauty.

2:47:41.220 --> 2:47:44.340
 Like give it a chance, give a chance to see the beauty.

2:47:44.340 --> 2:47:45.180
 And that.

2:47:45.180 --> 2:47:46.020
 Give it your respect.

2:47:46.020 --> 2:47:48.700
 So there is one person who does take time

2:47:48.700 --> 2:47:51.780
 and is what I consider to be a great scientist

2:47:51.780 --> 2:47:53.220
 in terms of what he thinks.

2:47:53.220 --> 2:47:55.820
 He obviously has invested interest in his own theory

2:47:55.820 --> 2:47:57.100
 and it's Eric.

2:47:57.100 --> 2:48:00.540
 Eric's got a truly encyclopedic knowledge

2:48:00.540 --> 2:48:02.260
 of the history of physics.

2:48:02.260 --> 2:48:06.260
 And he has a great warmth and graciousness

2:48:06.260 --> 2:48:08.140
 when it comes to giving other,

2:48:08.140 --> 2:48:09.900
 and I've witnessed this and I've had,

2:48:09.900 --> 2:48:11.900
 look, first of all, I think debate is pointless.

2:48:11.900 --> 2:48:14.460
 Like, I don't know about you, but if you've ever voted like,

2:48:14.460 --> 2:48:15.940
 oh, I saw this debate and you know,

2:48:15.940 --> 2:48:18.420
 because Trump did so badly, now I'm gonna vote for Biden.

2:48:18.420 --> 2:48:19.380
 No, never have.

2:48:19.380 --> 2:48:21.380
 You almost never change anybody's mind

2:48:21.380 --> 2:48:23.100
 unless you debate with love.

2:48:23.100 --> 2:48:26.780
 Unless you have almost like we're gonna win together,

2:48:26.780 --> 2:48:28.900
 like the red team approach in the military,

2:48:28.900 --> 2:48:30.380
 they're trying to win a war.

2:48:30.380 --> 2:48:33.380
 So they may disagree on the tactics day to day,

2:48:33.380 --> 2:48:35.180
 but the strategy, we have to win this war.

2:48:35.180 --> 2:48:37.660
 I love you and I wanna protect you.

2:48:37.660 --> 2:48:40.540
 I don't see that in very many of these physicists from Kaku.

2:48:40.540 --> 2:48:42.820
 I almost see it, it's embarrassing in some ways

2:48:42.820 --> 2:48:45.900
 because they'll almost mock with the exception of Eric.

2:48:45.900 --> 2:48:47.180
 You know, Garrett's interesting.

2:48:47.180 --> 2:48:48.460
 You know, his theory is, you know,

2:48:48.460 --> 2:48:51.660
 people have a lot of issues, very technical,

2:48:51.660 --> 2:48:54.700
 but Eric has taken the time to try to understand it.

2:48:54.700 --> 2:48:57.420
 Eric has taken the time to understand Peter White's theory.

2:48:57.420 --> 2:49:01.140
 And I don't see the same graciousness extended from them.

2:49:01.140 --> 2:49:01.980
 I'm sorry to say.

2:49:01.980 --> 2:49:03.260
 Yeah, essentially, you're right, you're right.

2:49:03.260 --> 2:49:05.980
 I mean, with Eric, he hasn't, he wants to,

2:49:05.980 --> 2:49:08.100
 but he hasn't extended the same for Stephen Wolfram

2:49:08.100 --> 2:49:09.980
 because I think Wolf.

2:49:09.980 --> 2:49:10.820
 No, he did.

2:49:10.820 --> 2:49:11.660
 No, actually, no, he did.

2:49:11.660 --> 2:49:13.580
 I had a debate with them live on my show.

2:49:13.580 --> 2:49:14.740
 No, I did, I listened to it,

2:49:14.740 --> 2:49:17.620
 but I just think it's outside of the toolkit

2:49:17.620 --> 2:49:19.220
 that Eric is comfortable with.

2:49:19.220 --> 2:49:21.140
 So it's not that he's not,

2:49:21.140 --> 2:49:24.380
 but the main thing that's often absent

2:49:24.380 --> 2:49:28.460
 and Eric does have is the willingness

2:49:28.460 --> 2:49:32.380
 and not just dismissing or mocking that he's reaching out.

2:49:32.380 --> 2:49:33.220
 But okay.

2:49:33.220 --> 2:49:34.860
 I mean, what if it's not,

2:49:34.860 --> 2:49:36.140
 you know, I made a joke when they were on,

2:49:36.140 --> 2:49:38.380
 I was like, how many theories of everything can there be?

2:49:38.380 --> 2:49:41.100
 You know, Highlander, there can be only one.

2:49:41.100 --> 2:49:42.220
 I don't know, maybe.

2:49:42.220 --> 2:49:44.580
 But he, of course, also, like the other folks

2:49:44.580 --> 2:49:48.700
 who propose a theory, has an ego.

2:49:48.700 --> 2:49:49.780
 Yeah.

2:49:49.780 --> 2:49:54.780
 He rides a dragon with the dragon representing the ego.

2:49:55.460 --> 2:49:59.140
 Well, let me ask you about your friend, Eric Weinstein.

2:50:00.140 --> 2:50:03.540
 So he proposed initial sketches of geometric unity,

2:50:03.540 --> 2:50:05.180
 which is his theory of everything.

2:50:05.180 --> 2:50:07.820
 Maybe you can elucidate some aspect of it

2:50:07.820 --> 2:50:08.980
 that you find interesting.

2:50:08.980 --> 2:50:13.980
 But what do you think about the response

2:50:13.980 --> 2:50:17.700
 he got from the scientific community?

2:50:17.700 --> 2:50:19.380
 Well, you know, some of the response came

2:50:19.380 --> 2:50:22.700
 from people, academicians, professors.

2:50:22.700 --> 2:50:24.580
 Some came from a lay audience

2:50:24.580 --> 2:50:26.780
 and some came from trained scientists

2:50:26.780 --> 2:50:27.700
 who are no longer, you know,

2:50:27.700 --> 2:50:29.540
 maybe practicing in the universities.

2:50:30.500 --> 2:50:33.340
 I thought it was, there was a lot of vitriol,

2:50:33.340 --> 2:50:38.180
 which surprised me because I look at what he's trying to do

2:50:38.180 --> 2:50:41.500
 and it was always, the vitriol would always come

2:50:41.500 --> 2:50:44.140
 with some element of ad hominem.

2:50:44.140 --> 2:50:45.860
 And maybe that's his personality,

2:50:45.860 --> 2:50:48.220
 maybe that engenders this or whatever.

2:50:48.220 --> 2:50:50.860
 Maybe there is kind of just a natural tendency.

2:50:50.860 --> 2:50:52.140
 You know, I always get these emails,

2:50:52.140 --> 2:50:54.700
 Professor Keating, I have a new theory,

2:50:54.700 --> 2:50:56.700
 Einstein was wrong, I'm gonna prove it.

2:50:56.700 --> 2:50:59.140
 I'm not good at math, but if you help me,

2:50:59.140 --> 2:51:01.260
 I will share my Nobel Prize with you.

2:51:01.260 --> 2:51:04.580
 And I'm like, oh, thanks, have you read my books?

2:51:04.580 --> 2:51:07.500
 In other words, it's always taking down the dragon.

2:51:07.500 --> 2:51:09.900
 It's always taking down the Kung Fu master, right?

2:51:09.900 --> 2:51:11.580
 That you get the hit points from D&D.

2:51:11.580 --> 2:51:13.020
 You get their hit points, you take their cards,

2:51:13.020 --> 2:51:15.460
 you get their risk tokens from Kamchaka.

2:51:15.460 --> 2:51:18.300
 And thinking about with Eric, it's like,

2:51:18.300 --> 2:51:21.180
 because what he's doing is so aspirational,

2:51:21.180 --> 2:51:22.940
 it is grandiose in a good sense.

2:51:22.940 --> 2:51:25.060
 What he's trying to do is construct

2:51:25.060 --> 2:51:26.900
 a geometric theory of everything

2:51:26.900 --> 2:51:28.740
 that has aspects of supersymmetry

2:51:28.740 --> 2:51:30.220
 and stuff embedded in it.

2:51:30.220 --> 2:51:34.380
 He's trying to meld that, it has very unusual features

2:51:34.380 --> 2:51:37.220
 and that it features not only multiple spatial dimensions,

2:51:37.220 --> 2:51:38.780
 multiple time dimensions,

2:51:38.780 --> 2:51:42.900
 it uses new mathematical objects that he's invented.

2:51:42.900 --> 2:51:46.660
 And look, I had him on my show, I've talked with him.

2:51:46.660 --> 2:51:49.340
 We've had consultations with other physicists

2:51:49.340 --> 2:51:51.860
 where he'll come down and I have a visitor's office

2:51:51.860 --> 2:51:53.500
 and he comes down to San Diego sometimes

2:51:53.500 --> 2:51:54.860
 and spends time there.

2:51:54.860 --> 2:51:58.420
 And we talk with eminent mathematicians and physicists.

2:51:58.420 --> 2:52:02.620
 Eric's been out of the academic world for a long time.

2:52:02.620 --> 2:52:04.420
 And there is, as I said before,

2:52:04.420 --> 2:52:07.460
 an aspect of persuasion that must take place

2:52:07.460 --> 2:52:08.900
 in order to get anything through.

2:52:08.900 --> 2:52:12.820
 And I think there was a slight amount of good nature,

2:52:12.820 --> 2:52:15.740
 not ignorance, naivete, but just the sense that

2:52:15.740 --> 2:52:18.260
 if this is right, everyone will recognize it.

2:52:18.260 --> 2:52:19.740
 If you build a better mousetrap,

2:52:19.740 --> 2:52:21.660
 the world will beat a path to your door

2:52:21.660 --> 2:52:22.740
 as the expression goes.

2:52:22.740 --> 2:52:24.380
 That's completely untrue.

2:52:24.380 --> 2:52:25.780
 That doesn't even happen with mousetraps.

2:52:25.780 --> 2:52:27.740
 I mean, you know how many fricking mousetrap types there are?

2:52:27.740 --> 2:52:30.020
 It's like, no, they don't beat a path to your door.

2:52:30.020 --> 2:52:31.820
 You have to sell that fricking thing.

2:52:31.820 --> 2:52:34.900
 You have to sell it like Steve Jobs or Elon.

2:52:34.900 --> 2:52:37.620
 I have never, I've had one paper out of 200 papers

2:52:37.620 --> 2:52:39.420
 I've published in peer reviewed journals.

2:52:39.420 --> 2:52:41.540
 I've only had one, half a percent,

2:52:41.540 --> 2:52:43.860
 published with no referees comments.

2:52:43.860 --> 2:52:45.420
 In other words, published like dream.

2:52:45.420 --> 2:52:47.700
 Submitted it, it happened to be in a prestigious journal.

2:52:47.700 --> 2:52:49.460
 Thought I was pretty psyched about that.

2:52:49.460 --> 2:52:51.260
 But you almost have to crave the response,

2:52:51.260 --> 2:52:52.540
 getting it back from a journal.

2:52:52.540 --> 2:52:54.220
 And I think he doesn't, first of all,

2:52:54.220 --> 2:52:56.380
 he doesn't subscribe to the peer review process.

2:52:56.380 --> 2:52:59.060
 He thinks that is anathema to the way science is,

2:52:59.060 --> 2:53:02.500
 invest interest in public, in journals, et cetera, et cetera.

2:53:02.500 --> 2:53:05.580
 I think you can have elements of peer review

2:53:05.580 --> 2:53:08.060
 that are substantive and valuable.

2:53:08.060 --> 2:53:10.100
 I think you have to learn from your critics.

2:53:10.100 --> 2:53:12.060
 One of my conversations with John Mather,

2:53:12.060 --> 2:53:14.980
 he talks about loving your critics in this book,

2:53:14.980 --> 2:53:17.140
 but not being so open to their criticism

2:53:17.140 --> 2:53:19.260
 that their criticism goes to your heart

2:53:19.260 --> 2:53:21.860
 and not being so open to their compliments

2:53:21.860 --> 2:53:24.020
 that their compliments go to your head.

2:53:24.020 --> 2:53:26.900
 It's a very tough Scylla and Charybdis to walk.

2:53:26.900 --> 2:53:29.060
 Well, there's something, I mean,

2:53:29.060 --> 2:53:31.940
 I wanna be careful here because I'd like to talk to,

2:53:31.940 --> 2:53:35.620
 talk to Eric about this directly,

2:53:35.620 --> 2:53:39.580
 but I'll just, from a perspective of a friend,

2:53:41.220 --> 2:53:46.220
 wanna ask about the drug of fame.

2:53:48.540 --> 2:53:51.540
 So there's also the public perception

2:53:54.740 --> 2:53:56.580
 of the battles of physics.

2:53:56.580 --> 2:53:58.760
 And so there's a very narrow community,

2:53:58.760 --> 2:54:01.900
 but then there's the way that's perceived.

2:54:03.000 --> 2:54:06.240
 The exploration of ideas is perceived by the public.

2:54:06.240 --> 2:54:10.800
 And so there is a certain drug to the excitement

2:54:10.800 --> 2:54:14.000
 that the public can show when they sense

2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:15.600
 that you have something big.

2:54:17.000 --> 2:54:21.200
 And that in itself might become the thing

2:54:21.200 --> 2:54:23.680
 that gives you pleasure.

2:54:23.680 --> 2:54:27.880
 And I think that with theories of everything

2:54:27.880 --> 2:54:30.640
 or with any kind of super, super ambitious projects,

2:54:30.640 --> 2:54:34.640
 and this is taking us back to when you were ambitious

2:54:34.640 --> 2:54:37.760
 about trying to understand the origins of the universe,

2:54:37.760 --> 2:54:41.400
 if you convince yourself that you have an intuition

2:54:41.400 --> 2:54:43.800
 about the origins of the universe

2:54:43.800 --> 2:54:47.440
 and you have a platform like you do now

2:54:47.440 --> 2:54:50.840
 where you start to communicate your intuition,

2:54:50.840 --> 2:54:54.440
 it's hazy, like all the science, you're still unsure,

2:54:54.440 --> 2:54:56.920
 but you have a sense, I mean, perhaps you don't have that

2:54:56.920 --> 2:54:58.520
 as much as an experimentalist

2:54:58.520 --> 2:55:00.360
 because you always kind of start going,

2:55:00.360 --> 2:55:05.360
 okay, how can I build a device to see through the fog?

2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:08.320
 But if you're more like a theoretician

2:55:08.320 --> 2:55:11.120
 who kind of works in the realm of ideas,

2:55:11.120 --> 2:55:13.100
 in the realm of intuitions,

2:55:15.160 --> 2:55:16.800
 it is also a source of pleasure.

2:55:16.800 --> 2:55:20.220
 You mentioned dopamine, a source of dopamine

2:55:20.220 --> 2:55:22.640
 that you can communicate to others

2:55:23.500 --> 2:55:25.960
 that you're really excited by the possibility

2:55:25.960 --> 2:55:28.760
 of solving the deepest mysteries of the universe.

2:55:29.680 --> 2:55:32.320
 So there's some aspect to which you want to be

2:55:32.320 --> 2:55:36.880
 a Grigori Grisha Perlman and go into the hole

2:55:36.880 --> 2:55:40.960
 and get the work done and shut the hell up about the,

2:55:40.960 --> 2:55:45.320
 speaking about myself, about talking about the dream

2:55:45.320 --> 2:55:48.720
 and planning and exploring how great it will be

2:55:48.720 --> 2:55:51.680
 if my intuition turns out to be correct.

2:55:51.680 --> 2:55:55.660
 If the sketches I have turn out to actually build

2:55:55.660 --> 2:55:58.640
 the bridge that takes us to a whole new place,

2:55:58.640 --> 2:56:02.640
 as a friend of Eric's or a friend of,

2:56:03.840 --> 2:56:08.640
 or my friend, what kind of advice do you give?

2:56:08.640 --> 2:56:10.040
 What is your role?

2:56:10.040 --> 2:56:14.280
 Is it to be a supporter given that he has many critics

2:56:14.280 --> 2:56:18.940
 or is it to be in private a critic?

2:56:18.940 --> 2:56:20.300
 Like a lot of my friends will say,

2:56:20.300 --> 2:56:22.920
 hey, shut the hell up, just get it done.

2:56:22.920 --> 2:56:25.760
 Well, first of all, I wanna ask you a question I've asked him

2:56:25.760 --> 2:56:29.720
 and then it comes from Animal Farm by George.

2:56:29.720 --> 2:56:31.480
 Probably my favorite book, yeah.

2:56:31.480 --> 2:56:32.960
 So you remember Benjamin the donkey?

2:56:32.960 --> 2:56:33.800
 Yes.

2:56:33.800 --> 2:56:35.160
 And he's talking to the pig.

2:56:35.160 --> 2:56:37.240
 I forget the pig's name, you probably know.

2:56:37.240 --> 2:56:38.060
 Anyway, the pig says to him,

2:56:38.060 --> 2:56:41.280
 you've got this long, lustrous, beautiful tail.

2:56:41.280 --> 2:56:42.120
 You're so lucky.

2:56:42.120 --> 2:56:44.560
 I got the short, curly, little squiggly thing

2:56:44.560 --> 2:56:46.400
 that does jack squat.

2:56:46.400 --> 2:56:49.480
 Tell me, how does it feel to have such a lustrous tail?

2:56:49.480 --> 2:56:52.080
 And Benjamin says, well, the good Lord,

2:56:52.080 --> 2:56:56.260
 he gave me a tail to swat away the flies.

2:56:56.260 --> 2:56:57.440
 But you know what?

2:56:57.440 --> 2:57:01.480
 I'd rather not have the tail if I didn't have the flies.

2:57:01.480 --> 2:57:05.800
 So I wanna ask you, as I've asked Eric, is it worth it?

2:57:05.800 --> 2:57:08.760
 You know, you've got these beautiful tail,

2:57:08.760 --> 2:57:09.940
 but there are flies.

2:57:09.940 --> 2:57:11.240
 I'm not saying in a negative way.

2:57:11.240 --> 2:57:14.480
 I'm just saying you get unwanted distractions,

2:57:14.480 --> 2:57:17.000
 dopamine, you know, it's kind of the highlight,

2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:18.880
 the spotlight effect.

2:57:18.880 --> 2:57:21.000
 It's obviously allowing you to do things

2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:22.460
 that you could never do alone.

2:57:22.460 --> 2:57:24.880
 And I think, you know, first of all,

2:57:24.880 --> 2:57:26.120
 I'd love to know how you answer that.

2:57:26.120 --> 2:57:29.380
 Cause that's something I don't feel I can relate to myself.

2:57:30.240 --> 2:57:33.560
 Well, this has to do with more like.

2:57:33.560 --> 2:57:34.400
 Platform.

2:57:34.400 --> 2:57:35.440
 Platform stuff.

2:57:35.440 --> 2:57:36.840
 Yeah, scale.

2:57:36.840 --> 2:57:41.840
 Oh, I, that has no, very little effect on me.

2:57:42.440 --> 2:57:43.860
 I enjoy it.

2:57:45.120 --> 2:57:46.600
 I enjoy meeting new people,

2:57:46.600 --> 2:57:48.400
 but that has nothing to do with platform.

2:57:48.400 --> 2:57:52.000
 Yeah, no, that has no effect on me.

2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:57.000
 I'm one somebody that enjoys the act itself.

2:57:57.080 --> 2:57:58.360
 So this conversation,

2:57:58.360 --> 2:58:01.160
 the reason I'm doing this podcast with you today

2:58:01.160 --> 2:58:03.800
 is because that allows me to trick you

2:58:03.800 --> 2:58:05.680
 into talking to me for a prolonged period of time.

2:58:05.680 --> 2:58:07.040
 I don't care about platform.

2:58:07.040 --> 2:58:08.400
 I assume nobody listens.

2:58:08.400 --> 2:58:09.920
 It really doesn't matter.

2:58:09.920 --> 2:58:11.120
 Yeah, I forgot it, right?

2:58:11.120 --> 2:58:13.480
 My whole test of it was a good podcast.

2:58:13.480 --> 2:58:14.320
 How do you know?

2:58:14.320 --> 2:58:16.000
 Like podcast has been around what, 12 years?

2:58:16.000 --> 2:58:18.320
 How do we know as podcasters we're doing a good job?

2:58:18.320 --> 2:58:19.160
 Like sometimes someone will say,

2:58:19.160 --> 2:58:20.400
 that was the best interview I ever had,

2:58:20.400 --> 2:58:22.600
 but that doesn't happen that often, at least for me.

2:58:22.600 --> 2:58:26.600
 But if you realize that you forgot to put the SD card

2:58:26.600 --> 2:58:29.360
 in that little guy and the Zoom didn't work,

2:58:29.360 --> 2:58:30.440
 would you do it again?

2:58:30.440 --> 2:58:32.200
 And I think if you say yes to that,

2:58:32.200 --> 2:58:33.080
 that was a good podcast.

2:58:33.080 --> 2:58:33.920
 Yeah, exactly.

2:58:33.920 --> 2:58:35.040
 That's exactly it.

2:58:35.040 --> 2:58:40.040
 So in that space, yeah, all of it is worth it.

2:58:40.880 --> 2:58:45.880
 But the dream, I'm more referring

2:58:46.360 --> 2:58:47.880
 to the psychological effects.

2:58:47.880 --> 2:58:50.280
 Forget the platform, forget all of that.

2:58:50.280 --> 2:58:52.640
 You know, maybe you shouldn't even brought up the platform

2:58:52.640 --> 2:58:55.920
 because it really has to do even in your own private mind,

2:58:55.920 --> 2:58:57.640
 which is what I'm struggling with.

2:58:59.080 --> 2:59:04.080
 I enjoy the planning, the dreaming, the early stages

2:59:07.200 --> 2:59:11.720
 so much that I often don't take projects to completion.

2:59:11.720 --> 2:59:14.080
 This is a psychological effect

2:59:14.080 --> 2:59:16.560
 that I'm sure basically everybody, every engineer,

2:59:16.560 --> 2:59:18.800
 everybody that does anything goes through.

2:59:18.800 --> 2:59:22.800
 I just, in this case particular, I think it also applies.

2:59:22.800 --> 2:59:25.480
 And I wonder as a friend, what is the role?

2:59:25.480 --> 2:59:27.520
 So yeah, I mean, that effect has been documented,

2:59:27.520 --> 2:59:30.240
 everything from planning telescopes to dieting.

2:59:30.240 --> 2:59:34.000
 So there's a tiny bit of dopamine that you get

2:59:34.000 --> 2:59:36.000
 visualizing how you're gonna feel.

2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:38.000
 You don't need to know this, but you don't deal,

2:59:38.000 --> 2:59:39.320
 but losing five pounds.

2:59:39.320 --> 2:59:40.920
 I say, oh, I'm gonna lose five pounds

2:59:40.920 --> 2:59:43.320
 and I'm gonna be able to run a minute faster.

2:59:43.320 --> 2:59:45.400
 So there's a part of me when I'm planning the diet

2:59:45.400 --> 2:59:47.040
 and the meals and the exercise

2:59:47.040 --> 2:59:49.160
 that I get a little bit of that thrill

2:59:49.160 --> 2:59:51.240
 and that actually saps a little bit of my willpower

2:59:51.240 --> 2:59:53.440
 to actually complete the task that will take me to that goal.

2:59:53.440 --> 2:59:54.600
 So that's a documented effect.

2:59:54.600 --> 2:59:57.840
 And that happens in project planning and project management.

2:59:57.840 --> 3:00:00.520
 It's a very, very important thing to guard against

3:00:00.520 --> 3:00:02.600
 as a manager of a big project.

3:00:02.600 --> 3:00:05.680
 With Eric, it's interesting because with him,

3:00:05.680 --> 3:00:08.760
 first of all, we relate extremely well

3:00:08.760 --> 3:00:11.800
 on a friendship level and very close.

3:00:11.800 --> 3:00:14.200
 He does remind me a lot of my father

3:00:14.200 --> 3:00:17.280
 and I've told him that just as a mathematician,

3:00:17.280 --> 3:00:21.560
 as a big thinker, in his case, as a father,

3:00:21.560 --> 3:00:24.440
 the father kind of figure that I didn't have in a sense,

3:00:24.440 --> 3:00:27.160
 but that he is a true lover of life.

3:00:27.160 --> 3:00:28.800
 He knows he's got a huge platform.

3:00:28.800 --> 3:00:31.440
 He knows he gets a lot of attention for what he does.

3:00:32.360 --> 3:00:34.640
 And I jokingly say, well, it's one thing,

3:00:34.640 --> 3:00:37.520
 like how do you know, Lex, that someone's an expert?

3:00:37.520 --> 3:00:39.000
 Experts say.

3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:41.360
 There's a good rule Ray Dalio writes about in principles.

3:00:41.360 --> 3:00:43.280
 He says, an expert is someone who's done something

3:00:43.280 --> 3:00:44.880
 three times successfully.

3:00:44.880 --> 3:00:47.160
 Like you can do something correctly once,

3:00:47.160 --> 3:00:48.440
 you could do something correctly.

3:00:48.440 --> 3:00:51.160
 It's very hard to pull off like three projects,

3:00:51.160 --> 3:00:53.880
 three telescopes, three whatever, right?

3:00:53.880 --> 3:00:57.200
 So look for, it's arbitrary, it could be four,

3:00:57.200 --> 3:00:58.440
 it could be two, right?

3:00:58.440 --> 3:00:59.720
 But the point is, look at Eric.

3:00:59.720 --> 3:01:01.440
 So how many things has he contributed to

3:01:01.440 --> 3:01:05.800
 and made pretty substantive kind of paradigm shifts

3:01:05.800 --> 3:01:06.760
 for different people?

3:01:06.760 --> 3:01:09.120
 I would say he's been right many times.

3:01:09.120 --> 3:01:11.360
 Does that mean he's infallible, that he's ineffable?

3:01:11.360 --> 3:01:12.680
 No, of course not.

3:01:12.680 --> 3:01:16.280
 For me, so what I'm saying is I get a little bit of the joy

3:01:16.280 --> 3:01:20.400
 of kind of learning something purely as a scientist,

3:01:20.400 --> 3:01:23.520
 something completely outside of what I do, mathematics,

3:01:23.520 --> 3:01:28.520
 gauge theory, the kind of very advanced geometry topology

3:01:30.200 --> 3:01:31.760
 that he's interested in.

3:01:31.760 --> 3:01:35.400
 But every now and then, I will sneak in that I want,

3:01:35.400 --> 3:01:36.840
 you know, I've told him, I'm gonna turn your son

3:01:36.840 --> 3:01:38.400
 into an experimentalist despite you.

3:01:38.400 --> 3:01:40.200
 You know, like he is not gonna be a theorist,

3:01:40.200 --> 3:01:41.240
 Zev is not gonna be a theorist.

3:01:41.240 --> 3:01:43.400
 He is working with me, he is learning from me.

3:01:43.400 --> 3:01:46.240
 We're trying to get him into, he wants to bypass

3:01:46.240 --> 3:01:48.640
 all of the kind of nonsense of undergraduate

3:01:48.640 --> 3:01:50.080
 and go straight to graduate school.

3:01:50.080 --> 3:01:51.560
 And I've tried to encourage him

3:01:51.560 --> 3:01:53.440
 that maybe he could do it, maybe he can't,

3:01:53.440 --> 3:01:55.160
 but there's no other way than to try.

3:01:55.160 --> 3:01:57.640
 And so I prepared a whole curriculum for Zev

3:01:57.640 --> 3:01:59.600
 to basically bypass all of undergraduate.

3:01:59.600 --> 3:02:02.000
 And to his credit, he's not earns all the credit.

3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:03.360
 He's learned it to a level

3:02:03.360 --> 3:02:05.080
 that matches many of my graduate students.

3:02:05.080 --> 3:02:06.000
 Okay, hold on a second.

3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:08.480
 I have to push back and this is me saying it

3:02:08.480 --> 3:02:11.600
 and I'm sure I'll talk to Eric about this.

3:02:11.600 --> 3:02:15.600
 But to say, you said Eric's done,

3:02:15.600 --> 3:02:19.240
 was right on multiple things.

3:02:19.240 --> 3:02:24.240
 I think Eric has a great deep insight

3:02:24.640 --> 3:02:27.640
 about human nature and how societies work.

3:02:27.640 --> 3:02:31.480
 And he says a lot of wise words on that world.

3:02:31.480 --> 3:02:34.760
 But I think if we're talking about experts,

3:02:34.760 --> 3:02:36.200
 you kind of have to prove, you know,

3:02:36.200 --> 3:02:38.520
 it's like Michael Jordan playing baseball.

3:02:38.520 --> 3:02:42.120
 Like he's proved it many times that he can play basketball,

3:02:42.120 --> 3:02:44.480
 but he's also got to prove that he can play baseball.

3:02:44.480 --> 3:02:47.480
 And I would say the whole point of, I mean,

3:02:47.480 --> 3:02:51.960
 of radical ideas is you're not, I mean,

3:02:51.960 --> 3:02:55.120
 it's very hard to be sitting on a track record of,

3:02:55.120 --> 3:02:57.320
 I mean, when you're swinging for the fences,

3:02:57.320 --> 3:03:00.840
 always there's not a track record to sit on.

3:03:02.040 --> 3:03:05.240
 And like Max Tegmark is an example of somebody

3:03:05.240 --> 3:03:09.320
 who has a huge track record of more like acceptable stuff,

3:03:09.320 --> 3:03:11.520
 but he also keeps swinging for the fences

3:03:11.520 --> 3:03:12.960
 in every other world.

3:03:12.960 --> 3:03:14.800
 So he has that track record.

3:03:14.800 --> 3:03:17.680
 With Eric, if you look at just the number of publications,

3:03:17.680 --> 3:03:21.480
 all this stuff, he chose not to travel the academic route.

3:03:21.480 --> 3:03:24.600
 So there's no proof of expertise

3:03:24.600 --> 3:03:29.600
 except sort of an obvious linguistic demonstration

3:03:30.040 --> 3:03:32.880
 of brilliance, but that's not how physics works, right?

3:03:32.880 --> 3:03:35.320
 There's a polite way to damn somebody as a scientist

3:03:35.320 --> 3:03:37.800
 and say he or she, they really know

3:03:37.800 --> 3:03:40.080
 the history of physics very well.

3:03:40.080 --> 3:03:41.240
 Like physicists always love it.

3:03:41.240 --> 3:03:43.280
 Like Sean Carroll always jokes about like,

3:03:43.280 --> 3:03:46.480
 physicists should never talk about history of physics,

3:03:46.480 --> 3:03:47.560
 but it's more than that.

3:03:47.560 --> 3:03:52.560
 So Eric has certainly contributed in finance specifically

3:03:53.440 --> 3:03:57.400
 and gauge theory and economics and inflation dynamics

3:03:57.400 --> 3:03:59.040
 and the non cosmological.

3:03:59.040 --> 3:04:00.960
 Hold on a second, that's yet to be proven.

3:04:00.960 --> 3:04:03.440
 He has a lot of powerful interests.

3:04:03.440 --> 3:04:04.920
 Calculate is calculus proven.

3:04:04.920 --> 3:04:09.920
 I mean, he has a gauge model for currency exchanges

3:04:10.920 --> 3:04:13.480
 between different nations that is explanatory.

3:04:13.480 --> 3:04:16.840
 Not, it's not, you know, is this something,

3:04:16.840 --> 3:04:18.320
 in other words, it's a model

3:04:18.320 --> 3:04:20.080
 and it's used for pedagogical purposes.

3:04:20.080 --> 3:04:21.760
 And it might be, okay.

3:04:21.760 --> 3:04:22.600
 It's unique to him.

3:04:22.600 --> 3:04:23.800
 I mean, to him and Pia.

3:04:23.800 --> 3:04:27.480
 Yes, it might be a powerful model.

3:04:27.480 --> 3:04:29.560
 It might be one that's actually deserves

3:04:29.560 --> 3:04:32.360
 a huge amount of applause and celebration,

3:04:32.360 --> 3:04:34.120
 but does not yet receive that.

3:04:34.120 --> 3:04:35.920
 And that's one of the things that Eric talks about.

3:04:35.920 --> 3:04:38.000
 It has not received the attention it deserves,

3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:40.920
 but it has not yet received the attention it deserves.

3:04:40.920 --> 3:04:43.680
 And so like the proven expertise thing,

3:04:43.680 --> 3:04:47.120
 I mean, there's a lot of people that go to their grave

3:04:47.120 --> 3:04:50.400
 without the recognition they deserve and it's a tragedy.

3:04:50.400 --> 3:04:53.760
 But the fact is like, you know,

3:04:53.760 --> 3:04:55.680
 you have to fight for that recognition.

3:04:55.680 --> 3:04:57.280
 The tragedy happens for a reason.

3:04:57.280 --> 3:05:00.680
 You can't just say this person is obviously brilliant

3:05:00.680 --> 3:05:03.360
 and therefore they deserve the credit

3:05:05.240 --> 3:05:06.880
 in every single domain.

3:05:06.880 --> 3:05:09.400
 It doesn't like transfer immediately.

3:05:09.400 --> 3:05:12.000
 There's nobody that's, well, at least I wouldn't argue

3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:15.520
 Eric is one of the special minds in our generation,

3:05:15.520 --> 3:05:18.720
 but you still have to fight the fight of physics

3:05:18.720 --> 3:05:20.440
 and prove it within the community.

3:05:20.440 --> 3:05:22.720
 And I think the same applies in economics.

3:05:22.720 --> 3:05:27.240
 You can't, I mean, as somebody that, you know,

3:05:27.240 --> 3:05:30.760
 I've gone through the academic journey,

3:05:30.760 --> 3:05:33.320
 just like you said, the peer review,

3:05:33.320 --> 3:05:35.840
 all of those things, flawed as they are,

3:05:35.840 --> 3:05:37.600
 that's the part of the process.

3:05:37.600 --> 3:05:39.360
 You have to convince your peers,

3:05:39.360 --> 3:05:44.120
 the people that are as obsessed for whatever the hell reason

3:05:44.120 --> 3:05:46.720
 about that particular thing that you're working on.

3:05:46.720 --> 3:05:48.040
 Yes, there's egos.

3:05:48.040 --> 3:05:49.240
 Yes, there's politics.

3:05:49.240 --> 3:05:50.880
 It's a giant mess.

3:05:50.880 --> 3:05:52.840
 But I think it's a beautiful mess

3:05:52.840 --> 3:05:56.160
 through which you have to go through

3:05:56.160 --> 3:06:00.520
 in order to reveal the power of your idea

3:06:00.520 --> 3:06:02.480
 to yourself and to the world.

3:06:02.480 --> 3:06:03.360
 Well, let me use an example.

3:06:03.360 --> 3:06:06.000
 So, you know of James Clerk Maxwell

3:06:06.000 --> 3:06:08.520
 and he invented the laws of electromagnetism,

3:06:08.520 --> 3:06:10.800
 which is the first example of a unification principle

3:06:10.800 --> 3:06:13.480
 ever displayed by the human mind in history.

3:06:13.480 --> 3:06:17.920
 Purely mathematics, unifying completely disparate phenomena.

3:06:17.920 --> 3:06:20.320
 In one case, electricity, charges,

3:06:20.320 --> 3:06:21.880
 static electricity, lightning,

3:06:21.880 --> 3:06:24.680
 and the other magnets, bar magnets, currents, et cetera.

3:06:24.680 --> 3:06:25.520
 Unify them.

3:06:25.520 --> 3:06:27.400
 And you know what he did?

3:06:27.400 --> 3:06:28.760
 I like to do a thought experiment.

3:06:28.760 --> 3:06:31.040
 Imagine Twitter exists, 1864.

3:06:31.040 --> 3:06:32.440
 Maxwell's working away.

3:06:32.440 --> 3:06:34.000
 And he goes, I have this wonderful idea

3:06:34.000 --> 3:06:37.760
 with fluxions and inductive virtue and blah, blah, blah.

3:06:37.760 --> 3:06:39.960
 And it revolves on this thing called an ether.

3:06:39.960 --> 3:06:42.800
 And by the way, there are these little vortices and gears

3:06:42.800 --> 3:06:44.520
 and the gears have these planetary things

3:06:44.520 --> 3:06:46.480
 and they suck up vortices and the vortices determine

3:06:46.480 --> 3:06:49.040
 the density of the electromagnetic potential.

3:06:49.040 --> 3:06:51.160
 You feel like this guy's a fricking moron.

3:06:51.160 --> 3:06:52.520
 And what would you do?

3:06:52.520 --> 3:06:53.840
 Come on, honestly, you would say

3:06:53.840 --> 3:06:55.560
 everything this guy does is wrong.

3:06:55.560 --> 3:06:57.280
 I mean, he's got this idiotic idea

3:06:57.280 --> 3:07:00.080
 and it would be falsified a couple of decades later

3:07:00.080 --> 3:07:02.040
 by Michelson and Morley.

3:07:02.040 --> 3:07:04.520
 And in so doing, you would have thrown out

3:07:04.520 --> 3:07:07.400
 a very beautiful baby with bathwater.

3:07:07.400 --> 3:07:09.720
 Imagine Twitter, imagine the twit storm,

3:07:09.720 --> 3:07:13.640
 clerk Maxwell, at clerk Maxwell one would get.

3:07:13.640 --> 3:07:14.960
 It would be brutal, right?

3:07:14.960 --> 3:07:16.040
 And to the detriment.

3:07:16.040 --> 3:07:17.560
 And that might even set back history.

3:07:17.560 --> 3:07:19.360
 Imagine Yang Mills doing the same thing.

3:07:19.360 --> 3:07:20.560
 Chairman Simons.

3:07:20.560 --> 3:07:22.200
 All these things are very fantastic.

3:07:22.200 --> 3:07:23.240
 But why Lex?

3:07:23.240 --> 3:07:26.680
 Why does Ed Witten, why does Juan Maldacena?

3:07:26.680 --> 3:07:28.000
 Let me give a good example.

3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:29.840
 Juan, brilliant guy, I love him.

3:07:30.720 --> 3:07:33.520
 He is the reason that Stephen Hawking conceded

3:07:33.520 --> 3:07:36.400
 his black hole information paradox loss issue.

3:07:36.400 --> 3:07:40.280
 What did he concede based upon Maldacena's calculation

3:07:40.280 --> 3:07:43.880
 in ADS, CFT and five dimensional wormholes?

3:07:44.920 --> 3:07:45.760
 Is any of that?

3:07:45.760 --> 3:07:47.440
 First of all, we don't live in ADS universe.

3:07:47.440 --> 3:07:49.960
 Second of all, we don't know if wormholes are traversable,

3:07:49.960 --> 3:07:51.840
 if they exist even.

3:07:51.840 --> 3:07:55.440
 These are devices, Kip Thorne is popularized for movies.

3:07:55.440 --> 3:07:58.320
 To say that this is something on which I will concede a bet.

3:07:58.320 --> 3:08:00.840
 Now, obviously Hawking was doing that for publicity.

3:08:00.840 --> 3:08:02.440
 Why does Maldacena?

3:08:02.440 --> 3:08:04.480
 And he's got a pretty high H index,

3:08:04.480 --> 3:08:06.560
 pretty well respected guy at IAS.

3:08:06.560 --> 3:08:08.240
 Love talking to him, brilliant guy.

3:08:08.240 --> 3:08:12.200
 By the way, also had made use of Eric and Pia's work

3:08:12.200 --> 3:08:14.840
 on gauge theory and economics originally.

3:08:14.840 --> 3:08:16.560
 And one, I believe the breakthrough,

3:08:16.560 --> 3:08:17.640
 I can't remember exactly what,

3:08:17.640 --> 3:08:20.600
 but partially credit some of the work that he did,

3:08:20.600 --> 3:08:24.000
 which appears there's a footnote to Pia Milani's thesis

3:08:24.000 --> 3:08:26.360
 and some conversations with Eric, I think in it.

3:08:26.360 --> 3:08:28.320
 Anyway, getting back to that,

3:08:28.320 --> 3:08:30.320
 why is there not the same skepticism?

3:08:30.320 --> 3:08:32.040
 Is it because Maldacena,

3:08:32.040 --> 3:08:34.160
 who's an eminent physicist obviously,

3:08:34.160 --> 3:08:37.360
 has published realistic work and done,

3:08:37.360 --> 3:08:39.040
 what about Witten?

3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:40.000
 Witten gets a pass.

3:08:40.000 --> 3:08:40.840
 I mean, if you, Witten just gets here.

3:08:40.840 --> 3:08:42.840
 Well, Witten gets a pass on which aspect?

3:08:42.840 --> 3:08:43.800
 The string theory?

3:08:43.800 --> 3:08:45.200
 Yeah, that M theory is correct.

3:08:45.200 --> 3:08:46.600
 I mean, here's, well, let me just say Hawking.

3:08:46.600 --> 3:08:48.400
 Hawking gets the ultimate pass.

3:08:48.400 --> 3:08:50.880
 Hawking would say things like M theory,

3:08:50.880 --> 3:08:52.200
 there's zero evidence for it.

3:08:52.200 --> 3:08:53.560
 I mean, there's the famous meme

3:08:53.560 --> 3:08:54.880
 that went around this weekend, like,

3:08:54.880 --> 3:08:56.200
 what is string theory predicted?

3:08:56.200 --> 3:08:57.040
 And it's nothing.

3:08:57.040 --> 3:08:57.920
 And by the way, that's actually wrong.

3:08:57.920 --> 3:08:59.840
 I talked to Kamran, I know you talked to Kamran.

3:08:59.840 --> 3:09:02.280
 Kamran says that string theory does make predictions.

3:09:02.280 --> 3:09:03.840
 It predicts the mass of the electron lies

3:09:03.840 --> 3:09:06.040
 between 10 to the minus one Planck mass

3:09:06.040 --> 3:09:07.680
 and 10 to the minus 30 Planck mass.

3:09:07.680 --> 3:09:09.680
 Okay, whatever, or electron.

3:09:09.680 --> 3:09:10.520
 It's a big range.

3:09:10.520 --> 3:09:11.720
 It's a huge range.

3:09:11.720 --> 3:09:13.920
 Is that, imagine Kamran comes up and again,

3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:16.560
 he's just some nobody, but he actually,

3:09:16.560 --> 3:09:18.480
 he doesn't have a profile, he's not Harvard,

3:09:18.480 --> 3:09:21.320
 has zero H and X or whatever Eric says.

3:09:21.320 --> 3:09:23.000
 Why do we not like, in other words,

3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:25.840
 why are we more harsh on people that are trying?

3:09:25.840 --> 3:09:27.600
 You know the answer to that.

3:09:27.600 --> 3:09:30.640
 So I get a million emails, just like you said,

3:09:30.640 --> 3:09:34.240
 you yourself, where they provenized in my world

3:09:34.240 --> 3:09:37.840
 as artificial intelligence, the equivalence of that,

3:09:37.840 --> 3:09:40.400
 is I figured out how to build consciousness,

3:09:40.400 --> 3:09:44.440
 how to engineer intelligence, how to, and sometimes.

3:09:44.440 --> 3:09:45.840
 You should send your emails to me

3:09:45.840 --> 3:09:46.680
 and I'll send my emails to you.

3:09:46.680 --> 3:09:48.000
 And we'll reply to each other.

3:09:48.000 --> 3:09:50.400
 I mean, and I don't want to sort of mock this

3:09:50.400 --> 3:09:52.360
 because I think it's very possible

3:09:52.360 --> 3:09:55.560
 that there is either kernels of interesting ideas

3:09:55.560 --> 3:09:58.860
 or in whole, like there is geniuses out there

3:09:58.860 --> 3:10:03.000
 that are unheard, but because there's so much noise,

3:10:03.000 --> 3:10:08.000
 you do have to weigh out like a higher

3:10:08.680 --> 3:10:12.120
 the Ed Wittons of the world when they make statements.

3:10:12.120 --> 3:10:14.800
 And that's why you build up a track record.

3:10:14.800 --> 3:10:16.860
 Like you just said with Ray Dalio,

3:10:16.860 --> 3:10:21.860
 you have to show that you can, like if you're a Pollock

3:10:23.080 --> 3:10:26.000
 and you show us a painting of a bunch of chaos,

3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:28.480
 you have to, and this is a bad example, probably,

3:10:28.480 --> 3:10:30.000
 because he probably never showed this proof.

3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:30.840
 I don't think he could do it.

3:10:30.840 --> 3:10:35.840
 Yeah, it's much more comforting to see

3:10:36.600 --> 3:10:39.800
 that they can paint a good, accurate picture.

3:10:39.800 --> 3:10:40.640
 Still life.

3:10:40.640 --> 3:10:43.440
 Of still life, of an apple on the table.

3:10:43.440 --> 3:10:46.320
 So there's, because then, I mean,

3:10:47.960 --> 3:10:50.000
 because then there's something

3:10:50.000 --> 3:10:51.360
 about the scientific community

3:10:51.360 --> 3:10:54.820
 that they have perhaps an oversensitive bullshit sensor

3:10:54.820 --> 3:10:57.200
 to where they're not going to give the full effort

3:10:57.200 --> 3:11:00.200
 of their attention if you don't have the track record.

3:11:00.200 --> 3:11:02.600
 Now you could say that's a kind of club

3:11:02.600 --> 3:11:04.960
 that only you have to like, you have to have 10,

3:11:04.960 --> 3:11:07.000
 you have to have this, yes, that exists,

3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:10.440
 but there's some aspect in which you have to play the game

3:11:10.440 --> 3:11:13.840
 a little bit to get the machine of science going.

3:11:13.840 --> 3:11:16.560
 Otherwise, if you're always saying,

3:11:16.560 --> 3:11:20.200
 well, I have my ball and I don't want to play your game,

3:11:20.200 --> 3:11:23.480
 your game sucks, then nobody's gonna want to play with you.

3:11:23.480 --> 3:11:24.720
 That's true.

3:11:24.720 --> 3:11:28.080
 Look, inherent in all of this is an underlying grandiosity.

3:11:28.080 --> 3:11:31.520
 Look, how could you talk about doing what Kaku said

3:11:31.520 --> 3:11:33.520
 on here and elsewhere?

3:11:33.520 --> 3:11:34.980
 We're looking for the umbilical cord

3:11:34.980 --> 3:11:36.840
 that connects our universe to another universe

3:11:36.840 --> 3:11:38.840
 that will then reveal in a one inch equation

3:11:38.840 --> 3:11:41.440
 that will surely win a Nobel Prize, the mind of God.

3:11:41.440 --> 3:11:42.960
 That's like a prerequisite, I guess,

3:11:42.960 --> 3:11:44.160
 to tackle these questions.

3:11:44.160 --> 3:11:46.960
 I think it's detrimental.

3:11:46.960 --> 3:11:48.840
 I think doing that, first of all,

3:11:48.840 --> 3:11:50.760
 I think there's an element of almost snarkiness

3:11:50.760 --> 3:11:52.560
 because none of these scientists are believing,

3:11:52.560 --> 3:11:55.720
 you know, Gnostics, they're not theists, right?

3:11:55.720 --> 3:11:57.640
 So they're using it as kind of a stand in

3:11:57.640 --> 3:11:59.200
 and always talk about Einstein didn't mean

3:11:59.200 --> 3:12:02.080
 he was like a Spinoza and he wasn't a, you know, a theist.

3:12:02.080 --> 3:12:03.040
 God doesn't play dice.

3:12:03.040 --> 3:12:03.880
 God doesn't play dice.

3:12:03.880 --> 3:12:05.200
 Yeah, Einstein's mentions of God, yeah.

3:12:05.200 --> 3:12:07.520
 Yeah, and then Stephen Hawking says if,

3:12:07.520 --> 3:12:09.660
 when we come, we get an M theory understood,

3:12:09.660 --> 3:12:11.560
 we'll know the mind of God.

3:12:11.560 --> 3:12:13.800
 That's the title of Kaku's book,

3:12:13.800 --> 3:12:16.420
 The God Particle, The God Equation.

3:12:16.420 --> 3:12:19.240
 It, you know, do any of them really believe in God?

3:12:19.240 --> 3:12:20.340
 No, is that a prerequisite?

3:12:20.340 --> 3:12:21.440
 No, I'm not saying that.

3:12:21.440 --> 3:12:23.400
 But the point being,

3:12:23.400 --> 3:12:24.900
 you're talking about something that has to do with God,

3:12:24.900 --> 3:12:26.560
 right, I mean, where else do you go from there?

3:12:26.560 --> 3:12:29.520
 I mean, I think God for now enjoys a little bit more,

3:12:29.520 --> 3:12:33.160
 you know, kind of a PR than Elon or Joe or whatever, right?

3:12:33.160 --> 3:12:36.040
 So like it's, you know, God's got a pretty good,

3:12:36.040 --> 3:12:37.280
 you know, H index himself.

3:12:37.280 --> 3:12:39.160
 He has a, by the way, a Twitter account,

3:12:39.160 --> 3:12:40.440
 just so you know, it's pretty good.

3:12:40.440 --> 3:12:41.360
 The tweets of God, yeah.

3:12:41.360 --> 3:12:42.200
 Yeah, that's right.

3:12:42.200 --> 3:12:43.320
 The tweet of God.

3:12:43.320 --> 3:12:46.040
 So if you look at that, you have to go in there,

3:12:46.040 --> 3:12:47.720
 again, you have to go in with some swagger.

3:12:47.720 --> 3:12:50.360
 You have to have a little bit of arrogance,

3:12:50.360 --> 3:12:51.520
 but you should, I agree,

3:12:51.520 --> 3:12:52.800
 mix with a little bit of humility.

3:12:52.800 --> 3:12:55.960
 So he's doing something, he comes from outside of academia.

3:12:55.960 --> 3:12:58.240
 Now, if he rails against, I'm talking about Eric now,

3:12:58.240 --> 3:12:59.700
 if he's just railing, oh, the system,

3:12:59.700 --> 3:13:01.200
 and I'm not gonna publish because F that,

3:13:01.200 --> 3:13:03.460
 and that's only created by greedy journalists,

3:13:03.460 --> 3:13:05.640
 I don't think he's doing himself any favors.

3:13:05.640 --> 3:13:08.120
 On the other hand, if he's shopping it, if he's talking it,

3:13:08.120 --> 3:13:13.120
 if he's willing to expose it to criticism,

3:13:13.240 --> 3:13:15.000
 and to even embrace people

3:13:15.000 --> 3:13:18.120
 who may not have the purest intentions perhaps,

3:13:18.120 --> 3:13:21.480
 but in the sense of like they're not arguing solely

3:13:21.480 --> 3:13:23.920
 to get to the truth with a capital T,

3:13:23.920 --> 3:13:25.680
 what they're trying to do is take down Eric.

3:13:25.680 --> 3:13:27.700
 Hopefully those people aren't out there.

3:13:27.700 --> 3:13:29.400
 But on the other hand,

3:13:29.400 --> 3:13:32.280
 looking at what Eric does for other people,

3:13:32.280 --> 3:13:34.600
 looking at the fact that he has courtesy,

3:13:34.600 --> 3:13:36.640
 he will look at Wolfram, he will look at Lisey,

3:13:36.640 --> 3:13:38.000
 who's one of his closest friends.

3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:40.240
 I mean, he calls him as his aunt, not his aunt.

3:13:40.240 --> 3:13:42.000
 Nemesis. Nemesis, right, right.

3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:44.280
 I think that's interesting that they're loving friends.

3:13:44.280 --> 3:13:46.160
 I really enjoyed that portal conversation

3:13:46.160 --> 3:13:47.920
 between Gary and Lisey.

3:13:47.920 --> 3:13:51.800
 Eric is torn about that conversation because, I guess,

3:13:51.800 --> 3:13:55.260
 because of the nemesis of the beautiful dance of minds

3:13:55.260 --> 3:13:56.920
 playing with these ideas and theories of everything.

3:13:56.920 --> 3:13:59.120
 Some of these things, you know, look, so fundamentally,

3:13:59.120 --> 3:14:02.080
 now I may disagree with him, Eric, on a different aspect,

3:14:02.080 --> 3:14:03.440
 which is the only one I'm capable of,

3:14:03.440 --> 3:14:04.500
 but let me say one thing,

3:14:04.500 --> 3:14:06.720
 which is experimental, but let me say one thing.

3:14:06.720 --> 3:14:08.820
 I understand probably a third

3:14:08.820 --> 3:14:10.640
 of what Eric's talking about with GU.

3:14:10.640 --> 3:14:13.900
 I understand, you know, GR, I understand mathematics,

3:14:13.900 --> 3:14:16.440
 I understand some group theory, fiber bone,

3:14:16.440 --> 3:14:19.120
 I can get a little of it, the age theory,

3:14:19.120 --> 3:14:21.980
 but I also understand what I don't understand,

3:14:21.980 --> 3:14:23.740
 and I understand that there are people like Witten,

3:14:23.740 --> 3:14:28.200
 Maldacena, Nima, other people that can understand it,

3:14:28.200 --> 3:14:29.840
 and they're not trying to understand it.

3:14:29.840 --> 3:14:31.080
 Sabina, she can understand it.

3:14:31.080 --> 3:14:32.500
 She makes all these, you know,

3:14:32.500 --> 3:14:34.160
 oh, I don't understand it, I don't want to understand it.

3:14:34.160 --> 3:14:36.480
 I don't have time, and then she makes a video,

3:14:36.480 --> 3:14:39.080
 a music video, you know, kind of mocking Eric

3:14:39.080 --> 3:14:40.600
 and Steven and Garrett, and I'm like,

3:14:40.600 --> 3:14:42.400
 oh, you have a time to do, and I love Sabina,

3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:44.480
 and I've actually promoted my show on her,

3:14:44.480 --> 3:14:47.140
 and I love her, and she's doing a wonderful job,

3:14:47.140 --> 3:14:49.880
 but you have a video that you said yourself

3:14:49.880 --> 3:14:51.520
 takes eight weeks to produce from start to finish,

3:14:51.520 --> 3:14:54.600
 and you couldn't have spent, you know, 30 minutes, two hours.

3:14:54.600 --> 3:14:55.920
 I, Brian Keating, have done it

3:14:55.920 --> 3:14:57.840
 as an experimental cosmologist,

3:14:57.840 --> 3:15:00.280
 and I have enough to say, like, this is interesting.

3:15:00.280 --> 3:15:02.880
 It's part of the ASEIR project, and it actually,

3:15:02.880 --> 3:15:04.040
 I shouldn't say that there are no people.

3:15:04.040 --> 3:15:04.880
 They're very serious.

3:15:04.880 --> 3:15:08.160
 Louis Alvarez Gommet at SUNY Stony Brook

3:15:08.160 --> 3:15:10.000
 at the Simon Center for Geometrical Physics.

3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:12.280
 Yeah, so he and I are running this seminar,

3:15:12.280 --> 3:15:13.120
 hopefully this summer.

3:15:13.120 --> 3:15:14.480
 We're gonna reenact the famous

3:15:14.480 --> 3:15:17.560
 Shelter Island conferences in the 1900s,

3:15:17.560 --> 3:15:19.240
 where, you know, Feynman got together,

3:15:19.240 --> 3:15:21.060
 and they calculated the Lamb shift and all that,

3:15:21.060 --> 3:15:23.300
 but what did that feature?

3:15:23.300 --> 3:15:25.680
 The harmony, the resonant minds

3:15:25.680 --> 3:15:28.520
 behind the best experimentalists in cosmology,

3:15:28.520 --> 3:15:30.580
 particle physics, condensed matter physics

3:15:30.580 --> 3:15:32.920
 is now teaching us tremendous things about, you know,

3:15:32.920 --> 3:15:35.840
 lower dimensional systems that can be applied.

3:15:35.840 --> 3:15:37.800
 Theorists and experimentalists, observers,

3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:40.640
 cosmologists, we all will get together,

3:15:40.640 --> 3:15:43.360
 and we're just gonna do it out of a spirit of love,

3:15:43.360 --> 3:15:46.080
 but if it's just like, oh, this guy's like a loudmouth,

3:15:46.080 --> 3:15:46.920
 I don't have time for that.

3:15:46.920 --> 3:15:47.760
 I really don't.

3:15:47.760 --> 3:15:50.360
 I don't think it's interesting way to spend my time.

3:15:50.360 --> 3:15:52.980
 There's a aspect that I hope to see,

3:15:52.980 --> 3:15:56.440
 and it goes back to our sort of discussion

3:15:56.440 --> 3:15:58.040
 about Joe Rogan.

3:15:58.040 --> 3:16:00.500
 I do hope to see sort of love and humility

3:16:00.500 --> 3:16:01.340
 in the presentation.

3:16:01.340 --> 3:16:06.040
 Like, let go of this kind of fear of your ideas being stolen

3:16:06.040 --> 3:16:09.500
 and the ego that's inherent to the scientific pursuit,

3:16:09.500 --> 3:16:14.500
 and now that everybody is established and known entities,

3:16:16.120 --> 3:16:17.360
 let go of that a little bit

3:16:17.360 --> 3:16:20.180
 so we can explore and celebrate ideas.

3:16:20.180 --> 3:16:21.360
 I would love to see more of that,

3:16:21.360 --> 3:16:22.580
 just like, as you were saying,

3:16:22.580 --> 3:16:26.120
 especially with these big ideas of theories of everything.

3:16:26.120 --> 3:16:26.960
 And I've talked, I mean,

3:16:26.960 --> 3:16:28.560
 this isn't talking tails out of school,

3:16:28.560 --> 3:16:30.080
 but I mean, he has made claims

3:16:30.080 --> 3:16:32.040
 that I fundamentally disagree with,

3:16:32.040 --> 3:16:35.840
 in terms of like, he's had this Twitter baiting,

3:16:35.840 --> 3:16:37.400
 loving trolling of Elon,

3:16:37.400 --> 3:16:39.260
 why are you spending all this money to get to Mars?

3:16:39.260 --> 3:16:41.140
 We should be spending money on interdimensional travel,

3:16:41.140 --> 3:16:42.720
 and we can unlock it if we...

3:16:42.720 --> 3:16:44.840
 And I said to him, and he makes the point

3:16:44.840 --> 3:16:49.540
 that the atomic theory, that unleashed the nuclear age,

3:16:49.540 --> 3:16:52.700
 and that could lead to planetary destruction.

3:16:53.560 --> 3:16:56.140
 But I make the point pushing back with love on him,

3:16:56.140 --> 3:16:58.760
 and I say, look, nobody looked into the equations,

3:16:58.760 --> 3:17:01.280
 like Fermi didn't look into all these equations

3:17:01.280 --> 3:17:04.000
 of the unification, which still doesn't exist, by the way.

3:17:04.000 --> 3:17:05.320
 We spent all this time, Lex,

3:17:05.320 --> 3:17:06.380
 and I don't know why it is,

3:17:06.380 --> 3:17:08.520
 it's a phenomenon purely in theoretical physics.

3:17:08.520 --> 3:17:10.920
 People are looking for the toe,

3:17:10.920 --> 3:17:12.920
 and they're overlooking the gut.

3:17:12.920 --> 3:17:13.760
 In other words, they're spending all this time

3:17:13.760 --> 3:17:16.060
 on the theory of everything, the God equation,

3:17:16.060 --> 3:17:18.720
 and there's this gut that unifies the three stronger forces.

3:17:18.720 --> 3:17:20.280
 We don't have a single theory for that.

3:17:20.280 --> 3:17:22.960
 And people like lash out, they've tried and failed at it.

3:17:22.960 --> 3:17:23.920
 Yeah, for people who don't know,

3:17:23.920 --> 3:17:27.340
 there's four forces, gut grant unification theories

3:17:27.340 --> 3:17:29.460
 that unifies the three forces stuff,

3:17:29.460 --> 3:17:30.880
 and I'm trying to get a shortcut

3:17:30.880 --> 3:17:33.480
 to the theory of everything, which unifies the four.

3:17:34.420 --> 3:17:35.820
 And then there's this whole thing

3:17:35.820 --> 3:17:38.180
 that maybe quantum gravity is not even a thing.

3:17:38.180 --> 3:17:43.180
 So we're trying to solve the puzzle of everything

3:17:47.300 --> 3:17:49.000
 at the physics level.

3:17:49.000 --> 3:17:51.540
 And then already before solving it,

3:17:51.540 --> 3:17:53.240
 already saying, once we solve it,

3:17:53.240 --> 3:17:55.080
 here's going to be all the beautiful time machines.

3:17:55.080 --> 3:17:59.160
 We're just level jumping it, going to level 256.

3:17:59.160 --> 3:18:00.900
 Time x and everything.

3:18:00.900 --> 3:18:02.920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:18:02.920 --> 3:18:06.780
 I suppose you need that kind of ego, that confidence,

3:18:06.780 --> 3:18:09.400
 that ambition in order to even have a chance

3:18:09.400 --> 3:18:10.240
 at some of these things.

3:18:10.240 --> 3:18:13.160
 The only two people in this book of nine Nobel laureates

3:18:13.160 --> 3:18:16.160
 who told me they don't have the imposter syndrome

3:18:16.160 --> 3:18:19.520
 were two theorists, Frank Wilczek and Sheldon Glashow.

3:18:19.520 --> 3:18:21.100
 And Frank is a pretty interesting,

3:18:21.100 --> 3:18:22.240
 and I know eventually we're gonna talk

3:18:22.240 --> 3:18:25.320
 about the meaning of life, but you talk about Frank.

3:18:25.320 --> 3:18:27.740
 Frank invented this theory along with his advisor

3:18:27.740 --> 3:18:32.040
 and another third person in the early 1970s,

3:18:32.040 --> 3:18:34.680
 which from 1974, three, when he was at Princeton,

3:18:34.680 --> 3:18:37.040
 all the way up until 2004, when he won the Nobel,

3:18:37.040 --> 3:18:38.680
 every day of his life.

3:18:38.680 --> 3:18:39.680
 Imagine this, Lex.

3:18:39.680 --> 3:18:41.120
 You're gonna have this startup.

3:18:41.120 --> 3:18:43.240
 Actually, someone tells you you're gonna win a lottery.

3:18:43.240 --> 3:18:45.180
 You're gonna win a lottery in 40 years.

3:18:45.180 --> 3:18:48.080
 What becomes your singular focus in your life

3:18:48.080 --> 3:18:52.440
 from now until the next 40 years?

3:18:52.440 --> 3:18:54.120
 Well, I'm not sure.

3:18:54.120 --> 3:18:56.440
 I mean, would it be winning the lottery

3:18:56.440 --> 3:18:57.280
 or if I'm so confident?

3:18:57.280 --> 3:18:58.720
 No, I'm saying you're guaranteed to win a lottery.

3:18:58.720 --> 3:18:59.560
 Yeah.

3:18:59.560 --> 3:19:01.000
 Here's this wallet, Bitcoin wallet.

3:19:01.000 --> 3:19:02.320
 It's gonna guarantee I have this much money.

3:19:02.320 --> 3:19:04.160
 It's stable coin, whatever.

3:19:04.160 --> 3:19:06.420
 You're gonna win it, but you have to wait 40 years.

3:19:06.420 --> 3:19:09.180
 To me, it would be surviving for the next 40 years.

3:19:09.180 --> 3:19:10.560
 You wouldn't leave your house.

3:19:10.560 --> 3:19:12.540
 You would go out in a bubble wrap hat.

3:19:12.540 --> 3:19:14.720
 You wouldn't go out with that 20 masks on, right?

3:19:14.720 --> 3:19:17.160
 Your whole life would be consumed with.

3:19:17.160 --> 3:19:18.400
 Now, imagine everyone's telling you

3:19:18.400 --> 3:19:19.440
 you're gonna win the Nobel Prize,

3:19:19.440 --> 3:19:20.800
 which is bigger than the lottery.

3:19:20.800 --> 3:19:23.240
 I mean, many P prizes are worth more than the Nobel Prize

3:19:23.240 --> 3:19:25.120
 and every person who wins a prize

3:19:25.120 --> 3:19:27.280
 that's worth three times the money, like Maldacena,

3:19:27.280 --> 3:19:29.280
 he would trade that breakthrough prize

3:19:29.280 --> 3:19:30.720
 for a Nobel Prize and a heartbeat.

3:19:30.720 --> 3:19:33.840
 So these guys had to wait 40 years.

3:19:33.840 --> 3:19:35.540
 Imagine the excruciating pain.

3:19:35.540 --> 3:19:36.560
 What got him through it?

3:19:36.560 --> 3:19:38.480
 He didn't feel like he didn't deserve it.

3:19:38.480 --> 3:19:40.520
 He felt like, hell yeah, I earned it.

3:19:40.520 --> 3:19:42.440
 He has that swagger.

3:19:42.440 --> 3:19:46.080
 And what I'm looking for in this asset is to try to find

3:19:46.080 --> 3:19:47.560
 ways that we can test stuff now,

3:19:47.560 --> 3:19:49.360
 cause I don't know if I'm gonna be here in 40 years,

3:19:49.360 --> 3:19:51.880
 I hope I am, but can we bypass, can we get shortcuts?

3:19:51.880 --> 3:19:53.600
 What's called the low energy regime.

3:19:53.600 --> 3:19:55.680
 And to me, that's what's interesting.

3:19:55.680 --> 3:19:56.720
 Like, what can we do now?

3:19:56.720 --> 3:19:57.560
 I don't care.

3:19:57.560 --> 3:19:59.640
 Like Isaac Newton came up with color theory

3:19:59.640 --> 3:20:00.680
 and he did something really interesting.

3:20:00.680 --> 3:20:02.280
 Next time I come, I'll bring you some prisms.

3:20:02.280 --> 3:20:03.120
 What did he do?

3:20:03.120 --> 3:20:04.040
 He took a white light.

3:20:04.040 --> 3:20:06.040
 He took a prism from the sun, actually.

3:20:06.040 --> 3:20:07.640
 He put it through a slit, put it through a prism

3:20:07.640 --> 3:20:10.520
 and it made a beautiful rainbow, like you've seen.

3:20:10.520 --> 3:20:12.320
 And then he took another prism

3:20:12.320 --> 3:20:13.760
 and he put it upside down,

3:20:13.760 --> 3:20:15.520
 like, you know, dark side of the moon, whatever.

3:20:15.520 --> 3:20:17.240
 And the light went through the first prism,

3:20:17.240 --> 3:20:18.080
 turned into a rainbow.

3:20:18.080 --> 3:20:20.000
 And then the rainbow went into a prism

3:20:20.000 --> 3:20:21.520
 and came out a white light.

3:20:21.520 --> 3:20:22.760
 That's pretty cool.

3:20:22.760 --> 3:20:24.760
 Then he took a popsicle stick or whatever,

3:20:24.760 --> 3:20:26.400
 it's probably, you know, pipe tobacco.

3:20:26.400 --> 3:20:29.720
 And he put it in the beam, like blocked out the orange

3:20:29.720 --> 3:20:31.760
 and it didn't make white light come out.

3:20:31.760 --> 3:20:34.120
 So he showed like colors of synthesis.

3:20:34.120 --> 3:20:36.120
 It's a common, he didn't use like

3:20:36.120 --> 3:20:38.120
 the Large Hadron Collider to do that.

3:20:38.120 --> 3:20:40.200
 You know, he used a very low energy experiment

3:20:40.200 --> 3:20:42.480
 to prove a unification in this color physics

3:20:42.480 --> 3:20:43.720
 and different kind of color physics

3:20:43.720 --> 3:20:45.400
 than in quantum chromodynamics.

3:20:45.400 --> 3:20:47.840
 But nevertheless, can we find things like that?

3:20:47.840 --> 3:20:49.800
 Are we spending way too much time and energy

3:20:49.800 --> 3:20:52.200
 thinking about the future circular collider,

3:20:52.200 --> 3:20:54.680
 which even if it gets built will cost $30 billion

3:20:54.680 --> 3:20:55.520
 just to build.

3:20:55.520 --> 3:20:56.720
 By the way, anytime from now on,

3:20:56.720 --> 3:20:57.960
 if I leave you with anything,

3:20:57.960 --> 3:21:00.160
 anytime an experimental physicist tells you a number,

3:21:00.160 --> 3:21:01.960
 always double it, maybe triple it.

3:21:01.960 --> 3:21:03.200
 How much is it gonna cost?

3:21:03.200 --> 3:21:04.080
 To operate it.

3:21:04.080 --> 3:21:06.240
 So like, do we build an aircraft carrier

3:21:06.240 --> 3:21:07.680
 to build an aircraft carrier?

3:21:07.680 --> 3:21:10.440
 Do we build a nuclear reactor, a semiconductor facility?

3:21:10.440 --> 3:21:12.040
 And the rule of thumb that works pretty well

3:21:12.040 --> 3:21:14.840
 in project management is it costs about 10% per year

3:21:14.840 --> 3:21:18.160
 to operate a given object of sufficient complexity.

3:21:18.160 --> 3:21:19.720
 And in this case, so in 10 years,

3:21:19.720 --> 3:21:20.800
 it'll cost double the cost.

3:21:20.800 --> 3:21:22.400
 So never believe a number,

3:21:22.400 --> 3:21:24.800
 whether it's from our mutual friend, Harry or whoever,

3:21:24.800 --> 3:21:26.160
 don't believe the number, double it.

3:21:26.160 --> 3:21:27.480
 And then say, is it worth it?

3:21:27.480 --> 3:21:30.440
 And so building a solar system size accelerator,

3:21:30.440 --> 3:21:32.760
 even if it were possible, do we have to do that?

3:21:32.760 --> 3:21:35.800
 Or can we use these two 30 solar mass objects

3:21:35.800 --> 3:21:38.600
 colliding together to test the number

3:21:38.600 --> 3:21:40.320
 of large extra spatial dimensions?

3:21:40.320 --> 3:21:41.160
 Can we do that?

3:21:41.160 --> 3:21:42.000
 People are working on it.

3:21:42.000 --> 3:21:43.080
 I think it's fascinating.

3:21:43.080 --> 3:21:46.120
 So focus on building detectors.

3:21:46.120 --> 3:21:46.960
 Experiments.

3:21:48.200 --> 3:21:53.200
 That like, where the cosmos is part of the experiment,

3:21:55.480 --> 3:21:57.280
 I suppose, is doing the hard work.

3:21:57.280 --> 3:22:00.200
 Cause when you're saying low energy regime,

3:22:00.200 --> 3:22:02.560
 cause for some of these, especially big questions,

3:22:02.560 --> 3:22:03.760
 like theories of everything,

3:22:03.760 --> 3:22:07.320
 you need some high energy events.

3:22:07.320 --> 3:22:10.240
 And so somehow figure out how the high energy events

3:22:10.240 --> 3:22:12.640
 that are already happening out there,

3:22:12.640 --> 3:22:16.040
 how to leverage them to understand here on earth.

3:22:16.040 --> 3:22:19.040
 So one of the alternative theories of cosmology

3:22:19.040 --> 3:22:22.000
 that is not a singular quantum gravitational requiring

3:22:22.000 --> 3:22:23.840
 as the big bang and inflation are,

3:22:23.840 --> 3:22:26.000
 is are these bouncing models.

3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:29.000
 Some of them feature a similar kind of entity

3:22:29.000 --> 3:22:30.560
 called the quantum field.

3:22:30.560 --> 3:22:33.280
 And that quantum field in the initial stages

3:22:33.280 --> 3:22:35.360
 of the universe of our current, after the bounce,

3:22:35.360 --> 3:22:36.600
 which is not a singularity,

3:22:36.600 --> 3:22:39.280
 it compresses to a classical kind of rebound

3:22:39.280 --> 3:22:41.480
 and the universe starts expanding.

3:22:41.480 --> 3:22:44.680
 During that process, the expansion is governed

3:22:44.680 --> 3:22:46.360
 by what's called a scalar field,

3:22:46.360 --> 3:22:48.200
 of which we only know one that exists,

3:22:48.200 --> 3:22:49.160
 that's called the Higgs boson.

3:22:49.160 --> 3:22:52.560
 Higgs is a scalar fundamental particle, fundamental field.

3:22:53.440 --> 3:22:56.280
 That field then later does double duty

3:22:56.280 --> 3:22:59.480
 and it becomes dark energy.

3:22:59.480 --> 3:23:00.920
 So it solves two problems.

3:23:00.920 --> 3:23:02.640
 And I'm not saying it's correct, we don't know yet.

3:23:02.640 --> 3:23:04.560
 But are there observations of,

3:23:04.560 --> 3:23:06.240
 and so dark energy is manifest today.

3:23:06.240 --> 3:23:10.160
 It's manifest in properties we see in supernova explosions,

3:23:10.160 --> 3:23:11.120
 et cetera, et cetera.

3:23:11.120 --> 3:23:13.160
 We see the effects of accelerating universe

3:23:13.160 --> 3:23:15.000
 caused by presumably dark energy.

3:23:15.000 --> 3:23:18.160
 Is dark energy a constant or does it vary?

3:23:18.160 --> 3:23:20.680
 That has to vary in order for this theory to be true,

3:23:20.680 --> 3:23:22.280
 because that eventually has to decay

3:23:22.280 --> 3:23:24.280
 so that the universe can not support itself

3:23:24.280 --> 3:23:26.600
 and collapse again, again classically.

3:23:26.600 --> 3:23:28.520
 So we could use low energy phenomenon.

3:23:28.520 --> 3:23:29.720
 It's hard to think of supernova

3:23:29.720 --> 3:23:31.360
 as being a low energy phenomenon,

3:23:31.360 --> 3:23:34.080
 but we use that as a tracer of the cosmic expansion field

3:23:34.080 --> 3:23:36.480
 and see, does it change or is it a constant?

3:23:36.480 --> 3:23:38.040
 That's an example of a low energy limit

3:23:38.040 --> 3:23:40.080
 to prove a high energy phenomenon,

3:23:40.080 --> 3:23:43.000
 unlike this collapsing universe in the cyclic model.

3:23:43.000 --> 3:23:46.480
 Speaking of things that cost a lot, but are super exciting.

3:23:49.120 --> 3:23:51.320
 Page two, crap.

3:23:51.320 --> 3:23:52.840
 No, we'll wrap it up.

3:23:52.840 --> 3:23:53.680
 No.

3:23:53.680 --> 3:23:56.520
 Calm down, this is, there's more than page two.

3:23:56.520 --> 3:23:58.520
 What do you think this is?

3:23:58.520 --> 3:23:59.360
 This is a...

3:23:59.360 --> 3:24:00.200
 Thesis.

3:24:00.200 --> 3:24:03.080
 Well, Louis de Broglie's thesis was three pages long

3:24:03.080 --> 3:24:06.040
 and he won the Nobel Prize for the wave particle duality.

3:24:06.040 --> 3:24:10.760
 So, size matters in different dimensions in life.

3:24:10.760 --> 3:24:13.520
 I think the lessons I've learned about life

3:24:13.520 --> 3:24:16.920
 is the short of the paper or the short of the thesis.

3:24:17.920 --> 3:24:18.960
 Actually the short of the paper,

3:24:18.960 --> 3:24:21.720
 some of the greatest papers ever written are short.

3:24:21.720 --> 3:24:26.040
 I feel like some of the best ideas in this world,

3:24:26.040 --> 3:24:28.720
 not to sound like a contradiction of Feynman,

3:24:28.720 --> 3:24:30.440
 a contradiction on top of a contradiction,

3:24:30.440 --> 3:24:32.720
 but it could be written on a napkin, honestly.

3:24:32.720 --> 3:24:37.120
 It just kind of tells you something about ideas.

3:24:39.480 --> 3:24:44.480
 What are your thoughts about the James Webb Space Telescope?

3:24:45.480 --> 3:24:49.880
 Is this, as somebody who likes telescopes,

3:24:49.880 --> 3:24:52.640
 and this is one of the, I think it says,

3:24:53.840 --> 3:24:57.640
 took 20 years to build, $9.7 billion.

3:24:57.640 --> 3:24:59.240
 Is that way too much, too little?

3:24:59.240 --> 3:25:01.240
 Are you excited about this thing?

3:25:01.240 --> 3:25:04.120
 It's sufficiently different from what I do in my field

3:25:04.120 --> 3:25:05.920
 that it's incredibly interesting to me

3:25:05.920 --> 3:25:09.560
 because I have no horse in that race.

3:25:09.560 --> 3:25:12.320
 And so I'm not competing with them for time or money

3:25:12.320 --> 3:25:14.320
 or resources or people or whatever.

3:25:14.320 --> 3:25:16.680
 So I can purely be an advocate

3:25:16.680 --> 3:25:18.920
 and an aficionado of science.

3:25:18.920 --> 3:25:21.800
 It is in some sense the successor to Hubble.

3:25:21.800 --> 3:25:24.600
 It will do things that Hubble can't do.

3:25:24.600 --> 3:25:27.600
 It will also may or may not have the impact

3:25:27.600 --> 3:25:31.440
 on a visceral kind of artistic level that Hubble had.

3:25:31.440 --> 3:25:34.200
 What are some of the most iconic things that Hubble did?

3:25:34.200 --> 3:25:37.720
 The Hubble Ultra Deep Field, the pillars of creation,

3:25:37.720 --> 3:25:42.720
 storms and imaging of these twisted deep sky galaxies.

3:25:42.920 --> 3:25:44.920
 Those resonated with the public.

3:25:44.920 --> 3:25:46.920
 Just visually, they were beautiful.

3:25:46.920 --> 3:25:48.920
 Yeah, when you look at these images,

3:25:48.920 --> 3:25:50.240
 the Hubble Ultra Deep Field,

3:25:50.240 --> 3:25:51.480
 you'll maybe put that in,

3:25:51.480 --> 3:25:53.960
 you'll show every speck of light except for one,

3:25:53.960 --> 3:25:55.920
 4,000 blobs of light.

3:25:55.920 --> 3:25:58.960
 There's one star in our galaxy, the rest are galaxies.

3:25:58.960 --> 3:26:02.200
 Now that image is less than 1 10th of your fingernail

3:26:02.200 --> 3:26:03.840
 held out at arm's length.

3:26:03.840 --> 3:26:05.760
 It contains 4,000 galaxies.

3:26:05.760 --> 3:26:07.080
 So now you can figure out

3:26:07.080 --> 3:26:09.760
 how many galaxies there are in the whole sky

3:26:09.760 --> 3:26:11.320
 just by seeing how long does it take you

3:26:11.320 --> 3:26:13.120
 to move your fingernail over the whole sky.

3:26:13.120 --> 3:26:15.200
 So we have another couple of hours.

3:26:15.200 --> 3:26:16.280
 No, so it comes out to be,

3:26:16.280 --> 3:26:18.880
 that's how we get 500 billion or more galaxies.

3:26:18.880 --> 3:26:20.320
 Now it's not exact to the galaxy,

3:26:20.320 --> 3:26:22.840
 but it's a good order of magnitude estimate,

3:26:22.840 --> 3:26:24.480
 maybe even better.

3:26:24.480 --> 3:26:26.920
 Hubble produced that and it was basically serendipitous.

3:26:26.920 --> 3:26:29.160
 They pointed to some dark blank piece of sky

3:26:29.160 --> 3:26:30.800
 what they thought was blank and they saw it.

3:26:30.800 --> 3:26:32.560
 Same thing that happened with the CMB.

3:26:32.560 --> 3:26:34.440
 They were looking for something they didn't find.

3:26:34.440 --> 3:26:35.880
 Same thing they found when they were looking

3:26:35.880 --> 3:26:38.280
 for the deceleration of the universe

3:26:38.280 --> 3:26:40.280
 and found it was accelerating.

3:26:40.280 --> 3:26:42.600
 So what I sometimes hear is that

3:26:42.600 --> 3:26:44.400
 we don't know what we're gonna discover.

3:26:44.400 --> 3:26:46.000
 I never think that's a good idea

3:26:46.000 --> 3:26:47.760
 to spend billions of dollars on something.

3:26:47.760 --> 3:26:51.120
 Like you should have some guaranteed low hanging fruit

3:26:51.120 --> 3:26:53.360
 and then there should be swinging for the fences.

3:26:53.360 --> 3:26:55.640
 And I think in this case, it was really everything

3:26:55.640 --> 3:26:56.560
 is swinging for the fences

3:26:56.560 --> 3:26:58.560
 because it's kind of a single point failure.

3:26:58.560 --> 3:27:01.840
 If that telescope, which is this origami construction

3:27:01.840 --> 3:27:05.400
 of 22 hexagonal panels that have to unfold properly

3:27:05.400 --> 3:27:08.200
 and then orient themselves a million miles from Earth

3:27:08.200 --> 3:27:11.000
 beyond the Earth moon distance by a factor of four

3:27:11.000 --> 3:27:15.280
 and still transmit telecommunication back to the Earth,

3:27:15.280 --> 3:27:17.680
 get solar energy, keep it away from the sun.

3:27:17.680 --> 3:27:19.680
 You don't wanna look through the telescope of the sun

3:27:19.680 --> 3:27:20.920
 with your remaining good eye.

3:27:20.920 --> 3:27:22.760
 And you do that and you cover,

3:27:22.760 --> 3:27:27.760
 it's gonna be phenomenal for science, for sure, if it works.

3:27:27.960 --> 3:27:30.640
 There are a lot of people think it's so risky.

3:27:30.640 --> 3:27:33.600
 NASA sunk so much of their budget, it ate up.

3:27:33.600 --> 3:27:34.680
 And what if it does fail?

3:27:34.680 --> 3:27:35.960
 I mean, there's no guarantee.

3:27:35.960 --> 3:27:37.720
 Yes, it's insured, but so what?

3:27:37.720 --> 3:27:40.000
 You're not gonna get back those 20 years of people.

3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:41.200
 Well, let's start building it again.

3:27:41.200 --> 3:27:43.440
 Like they didn't build two copies of it.

3:27:43.440 --> 3:27:48.440
 And then if it fails, it kinda has a dampening effect

3:27:49.240 --> 3:27:52.040
 on the prospects and the inspiration of the public

3:27:52.040 --> 3:27:53.240
 for what science can do,

3:27:53.240 --> 3:27:56.000
 what science engineering can do is out in space.

3:27:56.000 --> 3:27:57.640
 It will make a huge impact scientific.

3:27:57.640 --> 3:28:00.120
 Let's hope for the best, let's assume it does succeed.

3:28:00.120 --> 3:28:01.680
 It's launched in a couple of weeks.

3:28:01.680 --> 3:28:05.640
 And when it does, it will transform our understanding

3:28:05.640 --> 3:28:10.080
 of we just discovered not only like extrasolar planets

3:28:10.080 --> 3:28:12.120
 that have moons on them and asteroid belt,

3:28:12.120 --> 3:28:15.120
 we discovered an extrasolar planet in another galaxy.

3:28:15.120 --> 3:28:16.960
 This will be able to see crazy stuff like that,

3:28:16.960 --> 3:28:21.320
 spectroscopy, imaging, but it will be able

3:28:21.320 --> 3:28:22.960
 to go back farther in time,

3:28:22.960 --> 3:28:25.080
 such that we will be doing cosmology.

3:28:25.080 --> 3:28:27.480
 Hubble did some cosmology and measured the Hubble constant.

3:28:27.480 --> 3:28:30.920
 That was its key project when it was designed and launched.

3:28:30.920 --> 3:28:33.500
 But because it is optical telescope,

3:28:33.500 --> 3:28:35.680
 it's sensitive to more close in redshift,

3:28:35.680 --> 3:28:37.160
 so shorter distances.

3:28:37.160 --> 3:28:39.360
 Now James Webb is much, much higher redshift.

3:28:39.360 --> 3:28:42.320
 It can probe the darker, deeper, distant universe.

3:28:42.320 --> 3:28:44.480
 Okay, let's talk about not the distant universe,

3:28:44.480 --> 3:28:47.160
 but our neighboring planets.

3:28:47.160 --> 3:28:52.160
 First, I gotta ask you about the moon.

3:28:52.360 --> 3:28:55.120
 So there's a piece of the moon on this table

3:28:55.120 --> 3:28:58.640
 that you've given me that we didn't have to pick up

3:28:58.640 --> 3:29:00.200
 that arrived here.

3:29:00.200 --> 3:29:01.040
 That's right.

3:29:01.040 --> 3:29:03.360
 So how did a piece of the moon arrive here on Earth?

3:29:03.360 --> 3:29:06.660
 So this chunk of the moon, if it were delivered

3:29:06.660 --> 3:29:10.280
 by the Apollo and NASA missions,

3:29:10.280 --> 3:29:12.800
 you and I would be guilty of a felony right now

3:29:12.800 --> 3:29:14.580
 because it's illegal to own pieces of the moon

3:29:14.580 --> 3:29:16.520
 collected by the Apollo astronauts.

3:29:16.520 --> 3:29:19.640
 So don't even joke about that when you go over to Houston.

3:29:19.640 --> 3:29:21.360
 This piece of moon rock was delivered

3:29:21.360 --> 3:29:23.520
 via the old fashioned way by gravity.

3:29:23.520 --> 3:29:27.620
 So this was a chunk of the moon, which is blasted off

3:29:27.620 --> 3:29:31.840
 because the moon gets bombarded by asteroids and meteoroids.

3:29:31.840 --> 3:29:34.760
 Some of them eject material from the surface of the moon

3:29:34.760 --> 3:29:37.580
 into space, and it will then orbit

3:29:37.580 --> 3:29:41.120
 the common moon Earth system.

3:29:41.120 --> 3:29:44.020
 And it will then eventually enter our atmosphere.

3:29:44.020 --> 3:29:45.560
 And if the piece is large enough

3:29:45.560 --> 3:29:47.800
 and the trajectory is proper, it can land intact.

3:29:47.800 --> 3:29:51.040
 And this one landed with a few hundred grams worth,

3:29:51.040 --> 3:29:52.480
 and they sliced it up.

3:29:52.480 --> 3:29:56.380
 And then it was delivered via US Postal Service to my house.

3:29:56.380 --> 3:29:57.560
 So you can buy these pieces.

3:29:57.560 --> 3:29:59.680
 And actually, you can buy a piece of Mars.

3:29:59.680 --> 3:30:02.680
 You can buy a piece of Mars delivered by the same route.

3:30:02.680 --> 3:30:04.360
 Now, what's so interesting about that?

3:30:04.360 --> 3:30:06.560
 Well, if a piece of Mars can get here,

3:30:06.560 --> 3:30:08.640
 a piece of Earth can get there.

3:30:08.640 --> 3:30:11.440
 Some piece of Earth has some life forms on it.

3:30:11.440 --> 3:30:12.680
 It could get there.

3:30:12.680 --> 3:30:14.480
 And if that can happen in our solar system,

3:30:14.480 --> 3:30:16.440
 it could happen throughout the galaxy.

3:30:16.440 --> 3:30:18.400
 So I'm actually not of the opinion

3:30:18.400 --> 3:30:21.360
 that there is life elsewhere in the universe,

3:30:21.360 --> 3:30:23.560
 at least technological life that we can,

3:30:23.560 --> 3:30:26.000
 I see this look of horror on your face.

3:30:26.000 --> 3:30:30.120
 I view it, I am personally extremely pessimistic,

3:30:30.120 --> 3:30:31.360
 would be extremely surprised.

3:30:31.360 --> 3:30:34.480
 I'm just, I'm curious by the transition

3:30:34.480 --> 3:30:39.240
 because you just said that life could have arrived from Mars

3:30:39.240 --> 3:30:40.880
 or like from planet to planet

3:30:40.880 --> 3:30:43.440
 because of the meteorites striking it and so on.

3:30:43.440 --> 3:30:45.120
 And then you went to,

3:30:45.120 --> 3:30:47.680
 you don't think there might be life out there

3:30:47.680 --> 3:30:48.760
 in the universe.

3:30:48.760 --> 3:30:49.800
 Technological life.

3:30:49.800 --> 3:30:50.880
 Technological life.

3:30:50.880 --> 3:30:53.640
 Yeah, advanced intelligence civilizations.

3:30:53.640 --> 3:30:57.120
 Okay, so go on.

3:30:57.120 --> 3:30:58.560
 So that's the generalization

3:30:58.560 --> 3:31:01.120
 of what the famous astronomer Fred Hoyle called,

3:31:01.120 --> 3:31:04.720
 I know this is a PG 13, it's called panspermia.

3:31:04.720 --> 3:31:06.480
 Panspermia.

3:31:06.480 --> 3:31:07.320
 Beep that out, please.

3:31:07.320 --> 3:31:08.160
 Yeah, yeah, please.

3:31:08.160 --> 3:31:12.520
 And that's the exchange of genetic life form material

3:31:12.520 --> 3:31:14.360
 from other reaches on earth,

3:31:14.360 --> 3:31:16.880
 which explains the origin of life on earth,

3:31:16.880 --> 3:31:18.400
 but not the origin of life itself,

3:31:18.400 --> 3:31:20.240
 which I think is a much grander mystery

3:31:20.240 --> 3:31:22.120
 and much more interesting.

3:31:22.120 --> 3:31:23.160
 How did life get here?

3:31:23.160 --> 3:31:25.720
 And you've talked with many eminent people about that.

3:31:25.720 --> 3:31:26.840
 I'm not gonna add that much,

3:31:26.840 --> 3:31:29.560
 but just thinking about the reverse process.

3:31:29.560 --> 3:31:32.720
 Let's say life started on the earth somehow

3:31:32.720 --> 3:31:34.720
 and then made its way out into the universe.

3:31:34.720 --> 3:31:36.120
 Is there enough time for the,

3:31:36.120 --> 3:31:37.960
 whatever material went from earth

3:31:37.960 --> 3:31:40.560
 via panspermic direction,

3:31:40.560 --> 3:31:42.880
 spraying the love gun out into the universe,

3:31:42.880 --> 3:31:45.200
 did that then have enough time to incubate

3:31:45.200 --> 3:31:47.440
 and go onto a planet that could support it?

3:31:47.440 --> 3:31:49.680
 Certainly not within our solar system,

3:31:49.680 --> 3:31:51.400
 which traveling at the meteorite speeds

3:31:51.400 --> 3:31:53.880
 would require hundreds of millions of years.

3:31:53.880 --> 3:31:55.720
 Then looking at the evolutionary history

3:31:55.720 --> 3:31:57.760
 from bacteria to Bach,

3:31:57.760 --> 3:32:00.680
 from rocks to Rachmaninoff,

3:32:00.680 --> 3:32:01.880
 I don't know, I can do this all day.

3:32:01.880 --> 3:32:02.920
 Oh wow, that's pretty good.

3:32:02.920 --> 3:32:05.080
 How do you get from those very simple

3:32:05.080 --> 3:32:06.320
 inanimate objects to life?

3:32:06.320 --> 3:32:07.800
 I just simply think there's not enough time

3:32:07.800 --> 3:32:09.040
 for earth to seed life,

3:32:09.040 --> 3:32:10.720
 technological life throughout the galaxy.

3:32:10.720 --> 3:32:12.560
 I don't think there's any evidence for that.

3:32:12.560 --> 3:32:15.680
 But so you really think that the origin

3:32:15.680 --> 3:32:19.960
 of life on earth is a really special event?

3:32:19.960 --> 3:32:22.760
 Yeah, if it did originate on earth,

3:32:22.760 --> 3:32:24.800
 my question for those that search for life

3:32:24.800 --> 3:32:28.440
 outside the earth is what if you had a letter from God

3:32:28.440 --> 3:32:32.320
 and the letter said life didn't originate on earth,

3:32:32.320 --> 3:32:34.920
 like would you choose a different profession?

3:32:34.920 --> 3:32:36.440
 Like it would seem hopeless.

3:32:36.440 --> 3:32:38.280
 Like in other words, we only have a sample of one.

3:32:38.280 --> 3:32:40.320
 In fact, we only know of one conscious life form,

3:32:40.320 --> 3:32:42.800
 let alone one planet that has life on it, right?

3:32:42.800 --> 3:32:45.080
 What if you knew for sure it didn't start here?

3:32:45.080 --> 3:32:48.080
 That means that like there's almost nothing about earth

3:32:48.080 --> 3:32:52.240
 that is originated, it didn't originate the life process.

3:32:52.240 --> 3:32:54.000
 So to study purely the origin of life,

3:32:54.000 --> 3:32:55.960
 not life itself, I think that's still fascinating.

3:32:55.960 --> 3:32:59.240
 But how could we learn about the origin of,

3:32:59.240 --> 3:33:01.120
 remember you have to go from inanimate object

3:33:01.120 --> 3:33:04.280
 to a living object, whatever that definition of life is.

3:33:04.280 --> 3:33:06.360
 And I'm not an expert in many definitions,

3:33:06.360 --> 3:33:09.520
 Max, Sarah, you know, many different definition.

3:33:09.520 --> 3:33:13.800
 But how do you actually go from inanimate to animate?

3:33:13.800 --> 3:33:14.840
 It's a huge question.

3:33:14.840 --> 3:33:17.360
 Yeah, but then you don't have to be the place

3:33:17.360 --> 3:33:20.400
 where life originated to replicate the origin

3:33:20.400 --> 3:33:22.640
 or to under, like, yeah, that's one way

3:33:22.640 --> 3:33:26.080
 to understand something is to build it.

3:33:26.080 --> 3:33:27.760
 But another way is to just observe it.

3:33:27.760 --> 3:33:32.040
 You don't have to truly re engineer from scratch.

3:33:32.040 --> 3:33:37.040
 So, you know, but then yes, if it didn't originate on earth,

3:33:37.240 --> 3:33:41.800
 then your intuitions about the basic prerequisites

3:33:41.800 --> 3:33:43.640
 of life are off.

3:33:43.640 --> 3:33:45.160
 What's the governing principle, right?

3:33:45.160 --> 3:33:48.280
 Like, what is, and then you can have just

3:33:48.280 --> 3:33:51.640
 almost an arbitrary number of possible,

3:33:51.640 --> 3:33:54.520
 like, if life didn't start on earth.

3:33:56.480 --> 3:33:59.080
 So to me, that's exciting because it's like,

3:33:59.080 --> 3:34:02.160
 we know even less than we thought.

3:34:02.160 --> 3:34:05.200
 The thing is it can prosper on earth though.

3:34:05.200 --> 3:34:06.040
 Yeah.

3:34:06.040 --> 3:34:08.920
 So maybe the origin of life is fundamentally different

3:34:08.920 --> 3:34:11.240
 from the maintenance of life.

3:34:11.240 --> 3:34:13.200
 Right, and maybe the existence

3:34:13.200 --> 3:34:16.680
 of the earth life symbiosis is critical.

3:34:16.680 --> 3:34:19.800
 I think Sarah, and you talked about Sarah Walker,

3:34:19.800 --> 3:34:22.120
 that it's a planetary phenomenon, et cetera, et cetera.

3:34:22.120 --> 3:34:24.240
 So doesn't that make it less like, in other words,

3:34:24.240 --> 3:34:27.120
 like not only do you need special life conditions

3:34:27.120 --> 3:34:31.560
 to create life, but then sustenance of life, as you say,

3:34:31.560 --> 3:34:33.840
 that also has to be maintained

3:34:33.840 --> 3:34:35.640
 under very specific circumstances

3:34:35.640 --> 3:34:37.000
 by very specific planets

3:34:37.000 --> 3:34:39.520
 and with very specific tectonic activity and moon.

3:34:39.520 --> 3:34:41.480
 And by the way, you need a Jupiter nearby.

3:34:41.480 --> 3:34:43.760
 You need an earth and a moon system

3:34:43.760 --> 3:34:45.960
 so that you don't get bombarded too early.

3:34:45.960 --> 3:34:48.720
 And I always think like this, like technological life,

3:34:48.720 --> 3:34:50.600
 I haven't said this before, really, so I'm just speaking.

3:34:50.600 --> 3:34:52.760
 I usually like to write down before I say these different,

3:34:52.760 --> 3:34:53.840
 but one of the things I thought about is.

3:34:53.840 --> 3:34:56.000
 Somebody hosts a podcast.

3:34:56.000 --> 3:34:57.720
 You should probably accept the fact

3:34:57.720 --> 3:34:59.320
 that you're going to say stupid things

3:34:59.320 --> 3:35:00.200
 every once in a while.

3:35:00.200 --> 3:35:02.880
 Not every once in a while, every while.

3:35:02.880 --> 3:35:07.880
 I claim that to get to sending people to the moon,

3:35:08.440 --> 3:35:12.000
 our planet needed whales and dinosaurs, right?

3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:13.360
 Like you don't make a solar panel

3:35:13.360 --> 3:35:14.880
 from another solar panel.

3:35:14.880 --> 3:35:17.120
 Like you made a solar panel from a factory

3:35:17.120 --> 3:35:20.200
 that melted down glass, silica, aluminum,

3:35:20.200 --> 3:35:21.760
 extruded that using fossil fuels.

3:35:21.760 --> 3:35:23.400
 Where do those fossil fuels come from?

3:35:23.400 --> 3:35:26.200
 Like, so any civilization that's going to be a Dyson,

3:35:26.200 --> 3:35:29.320
 you know, a Kardashev, do they have dinosaurs?

3:35:29.320 --> 3:35:31.280
 Like, do they have like prebiotic life?

3:35:31.280 --> 3:35:32.920
 Do they have a great oxygenation event?

3:35:32.920 --> 3:35:37.400
 Did they have a dimorphism between prokaryotic, eukaryotic?

3:35:37.400 --> 3:35:39.160
 All those hurdles, let's say you give each one,

3:35:39.160 --> 3:35:40.920
 let's say there's eight hurdles.

3:35:40.920 --> 3:35:42.520
 And each one of those has a probability

3:35:42.520 --> 3:35:44.600
 of one in a thousand to go from, you know,

3:35:44.600 --> 3:35:46.760
 eukaryotic, prokaryotic, whatever.

3:35:46.760 --> 3:35:48.120
 Let's say that's a one in a thousand chance.

3:35:48.120 --> 3:35:50.480
 I think it's like one in 10 to the 40th or whatever,

3:35:50.480 --> 3:35:51.320
 if you really do it.

3:35:51.320 --> 3:35:53.200
 But let's say it's first generous nature.

3:35:53.200 --> 3:35:55.040
 One in 10 to the three.

3:35:55.040 --> 3:35:57.080
 Let's say there's eight of those hurdles.

3:35:57.080 --> 3:36:01.120
 That means you have 10 to the 24th power,

3:36:01.120 --> 3:36:03.280
 different possibility.

3:36:03.280 --> 3:36:04.520
 And that's just with eight.

3:36:04.520 --> 3:36:05.760
 Like the moon has to be there.

3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:06.640
 Jupiter has to be there.

3:36:06.640 --> 3:36:07.880
 Dinosaurs had to be there.

3:36:07.880 --> 3:36:08.900
 All the different things that we have

3:36:08.900 --> 3:36:11.040
 to get to technological life.

3:36:11.040 --> 3:36:12.800
 There's only 10 to the, only,

3:36:12.800 --> 3:36:15.240
 there's 10 to the 22nd, we think,

3:36:15.240 --> 3:36:18.900
 Earth, not Earth, planets in the observable universe,

3:36:18.900 --> 3:36:20.420
 not the galaxy.

3:36:20.420 --> 3:36:23.800
 So that's 100 times fewer than the probability

3:36:23.800 --> 3:36:26.360
 to get, you know, 100% clearing these eight

3:36:26.360 --> 3:36:28.820
 very low hurdles of one in a thousand.

3:36:28.820 --> 3:36:30.760
 That's fascinating, because now I really need

3:36:30.760 --> 3:36:32.960
 to listen to your conversation with Lee Cronin,

3:36:32.960 --> 3:36:36.480
 who I believe you had, because he believes the opposite.

3:36:36.480 --> 3:36:37.600
 Yes, I know.

3:36:37.600 --> 3:36:39.760
 Yeah, I want to have a debate with him.

3:36:39.760 --> 3:36:44.760
 He believes that the way biology evolved on Earth

3:36:45.480 --> 3:36:48.920
 could have evolved almost an infinite number of other ways.

3:36:48.920 --> 3:36:51.160
 So like, if you ran Earth over and over and over,

3:36:51.160 --> 3:36:54.280
 you would keep getting life and it would be very different.

3:36:54.280 --> 3:36:59.280
 So it's, the fact that our particular life seems unique

3:37:00.040 --> 3:37:02.280
 is just like, well, because every freaking life

3:37:02.280 --> 3:37:05.040
 is going to seem unique, but it'll be very different.

3:37:05.040 --> 3:37:07.660
 It's not like, we shouldn't be asking the question

3:37:07.660 --> 3:37:11.180
 of what's the likelihood of getting a human like thing?

3:37:12.920 --> 3:37:15.300
 Because that seems to be super special.

3:37:15.300 --> 3:37:20.200
 It's more like, how easy is it to make

3:37:20.200 --> 3:37:21.520
 Slime mold.

3:37:21.520 --> 3:37:23.960
 Anything that has the skills of a human?

3:37:23.960 --> 3:37:26.040
 And I don't mean like something with thumbs,

3:37:26.040 --> 3:37:29.580
 but achieving basically a technological civilization.

3:37:29.580 --> 3:37:33.840
 And according to Lee at least, it's like, it's trivial.

3:37:33.840 --> 3:37:35.560
 I know, we fought, I fought a little bit.

3:37:35.560 --> 3:37:37.000
 I'd love to debate him and I think it'd be a lot of fun.

3:37:37.000 --> 3:37:38.680
 Because we debate with love when I talk with Lee.

3:37:38.680 --> 3:37:40.880
 I love him and he loves me, I think, I hope.

3:37:40.880 --> 3:37:42.440
 But let me ask you a question.

3:37:42.440 --> 3:37:45.920
 I asked this of him and Sarah on our Clubhouse ones.

3:37:45.920 --> 3:37:47.840
 So what do you think would happen the next day?

3:37:47.840 --> 3:37:52.260
 Let's say we discover life, it's Proxima Centauri B.

3:37:52.260 --> 3:37:54.920
 It looks just like Slime mold,

3:37:54.920 --> 3:37:57.800
 like you got on your Brie cheese or whatever.

3:37:57.800 --> 3:38:00.500
 We discover it, what would happen the next day?

3:38:01.400 --> 3:38:03.960
 And they were like, oh, this would be transformative.

3:38:03.960 --> 3:38:06.920
 And I'm not trying to be like Total Cassandra about this,

3:38:06.920 --> 3:38:09.800
 but I said, I don't think anything would happen.

3:38:09.800 --> 3:38:10.640
 And what are you talking about?

3:38:10.640 --> 3:38:12.160
 It would be transformational.

3:38:12.160 --> 3:38:14.240
 I'm like, I stipulate that life exists.

3:38:14.240 --> 3:38:16.760
 Go down to like the river, I'm in San Diego,

3:38:16.760 --> 3:38:19.240
 go down to the Pacific Ocean, scoop up a glass.

3:38:21.280 --> 3:38:22.700
 You're gonna find life in there.

3:38:22.700 --> 3:38:23.620
 And what are we doing?

3:38:23.620 --> 3:38:25.400
 What are we doing to our earth?

3:38:25.400 --> 3:38:27.320
 We're destroying it callously.

3:38:27.320 --> 3:38:29.080
 We're like pumping crap into there.

3:38:29.080 --> 3:38:30.480
 Like we have this toxic waste spill

3:38:30.480 --> 3:38:31.680
 a couple of months ago in San Diego,

3:38:31.680 --> 3:38:33.640
 I couldn't go to the beach.

3:38:33.640 --> 3:38:35.240
 Let me take it a step further.

3:38:35.240 --> 3:38:38.080
 You know how many people, I'm sorry that you do know,

3:38:38.080 --> 3:38:41.520
 but how many people died in the 20th century killed?

3:38:41.520 --> 3:38:44.120
 These are advanced civil, this isn't a slime mold.

3:38:44.120 --> 3:38:48.240
 We kill, we maim, we harm, we hurt, we hate.

3:38:48.240 --> 3:38:50.160
 I don't think anything would happen the next day.

3:38:50.160 --> 3:38:51.000
 Then we go back to what we had.

3:38:51.000 --> 3:38:52.920
 And I said, if that weren't proof enough,

3:38:52.920 --> 3:38:55.280
 life has been discovered at least two or three times

3:38:55.280 --> 3:38:56.560
 just in my professional career.

3:38:56.560 --> 3:39:01.200
 Once in 1996, these Allenland Hills meteorites in Antarctica,

3:39:01.200 --> 3:39:04.400
 they saw like microbial respiration processes.

3:39:04.400 --> 3:39:06.200
 Still we don't know, it was a press conference

3:39:06.200 --> 3:39:08.160
 held by Bill Clinton on the White House lawn

3:39:08.160 --> 3:39:10.640
 that's featured in the movie Contact.

3:39:10.640 --> 3:39:12.000
 My purpose for that movie.

3:39:12.880 --> 3:39:17.200
 And then there's this phosphorus life,

3:39:17.200 --> 3:39:20.920
 this toxic life in the pools of Mono Lake.

3:39:20.920 --> 3:39:24.280
 Many, you know, extremophile, we don't give a crap.

3:39:24.280 --> 3:39:25.440
 We continue to treat.

3:39:25.440 --> 3:39:27.720
 So why are we thinking that like our salvation,

3:39:27.720 --> 3:39:30.640
 from whence will our salvation come as the Bible says?

3:39:30.640 --> 3:39:32.600
 Like it's not gonna change how we are.

3:39:32.600 --> 3:39:36.200
 It's not gonna magnify how I treat you or you treat me.

3:39:36.200 --> 3:39:38.000
 And we're pretty knowledgeable people,

3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:39.800
 you and I compared to, you know, lay people.

3:39:39.800 --> 3:39:40.760
 Okay, that's interesting.

3:39:40.760 --> 3:39:41.920
 That's a really interesting argument.

3:39:41.920 --> 3:39:43.040
 I wonder if you're right.

3:39:43.040 --> 3:39:48.040
 But my intuition is I can maybe present

3:39:49.400 --> 3:39:51.800
 a different argument that you can think about

3:39:51.800 --> 3:39:54.800
 in the realm of things you care about even deeper,

3:39:54.800 --> 3:39:57.200
 which is like what happens once we figure out

3:39:57.200 --> 3:39:58.840
 the origins of the universe?

3:39:58.840 --> 3:40:00.480
 Like how would that change your life?

3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:03.440
 I would say there are certain discoveries

3:40:03.440 --> 3:40:05.000
 that even in their very idea

3:40:05.000 --> 3:40:07.280
 will change the fabric of society.

3:40:07.280 --> 3:40:10.160
 I tend to see if there's definitive proof

3:40:10.160 --> 3:40:12.160
 that there's life and the more complex,

3:40:12.160 --> 3:40:16.720
 the more powerful that idea is elsewhere.

3:40:16.720 --> 3:40:20.440
 That I'm not exactly sure how it will change society

3:40:21.760 --> 3:40:24.560
 because it's such a slap in the face.

3:40:24.560 --> 3:40:28.040
 It's such a humbling force or maybe not.

3:40:28.040 --> 3:40:30.120
 Or maybe it's a motivator to say,

3:40:31.200 --> 3:40:33.040
 yeah, I don't know which force would take over.

3:40:33.040 --> 3:40:36.120
 Maybe it would be governments with military

3:40:36.120 --> 3:40:39.000
 that start to think like, well, how do we kill it?

3:40:40.240 --> 3:40:41.560
 If there's a lot of life out there,

3:40:41.560 --> 3:40:43.080
 how do we create the defenses?

3:40:43.080 --> 3:40:44.600
 How do we extract it?

3:40:44.600 --> 3:40:47.960
 Or mine it for benefits?

3:40:47.960 --> 3:40:50.080
 I mean, I just see like there's 100 million

3:40:50.080 --> 3:40:51.760
 literal counter examples of that.

3:40:51.760 --> 3:40:56.760
 I mean, right now there's like 700 million kids in poverty.

3:40:57.600 --> 3:41:00.120
 How do we go about our life and just not deal with that?

3:41:00.120 --> 3:41:01.720
 I mean, look, I put it aside.

3:41:01.720 --> 3:41:04.840
 I eat hamburgers and in 100 years I'll be canceled

3:41:04.840 --> 3:41:07.200
 for being a carnivore or whatever.

3:41:08.200 --> 3:41:09.640
 So obviously to get through life,

3:41:09.640 --> 3:41:10.760
 you have to make certain compromise.

3:41:10.760 --> 3:41:12.720
 You're not gonna think about certain things.

3:41:12.720 --> 3:41:15.800
 But I just think there is a sort of wish fulfillment.

3:41:15.800 --> 3:41:17.880
 Like every time there's, why are we going to Mars

3:41:17.880 --> 3:41:20.400
 and digging and flying this cool ass helicopter?

3:41:20.400 --> 3:41:21.240
 We're looking for water.

3:41:21.240 --> 3:41:23.680
 Like stipulate that water was there.

3:41:23.680 --> 3:41:25.000
 Like, I believe there was water.

3:41:25.000 --> 3:41:26.120
 I think we should investigate

3:41:26.120 --> 3:41:28.160
 and see what the geology was like.

3:41:28.160 --> 3:41:29.840
 But don't you think, so you're saying?

3:41:29.840 --> 3:41:31.160
 I don't think you're gonna get meaning from it.

3:41:31.160 --> 3:41:32.000
 That's all I'm saying.

3:41:32.000 --> 3:41:33.720
 I'm not saying it's not worth doing.

3:41:33.720 --> 3:41:36.640
 I'm just saying there's a wish fulfillment aspect

3:41:36.640 --> 3:41:39.840
 that people will find meaning for life from science.

3:41:39.840 --> 3:41:44.200
 Okay, but there's a complicated line here.

3:41:44.200 --> 3:41:49.200
 What if it's this intelligent civilization living,

3:41:49.360 --> 3:41:51.560
 obviously probably not on Mars,

3:41:51.560 --> 3:41:55.280
 but somewhere like in a neighboring galaxy that we,

3:41:55.280 --> 3:42:00.280
 sorry, in a neighboring star system that we discover,

3:42:00.280 --> 3:42:02.240
 that we discover,

3:42:02.240 --> 3:42:05.320
 don't you think that profound change in meaning?

3:42:05.320 --> 3:42:06.200
 I mean, I guess, again,

3:42:06.200 --> 3:42:09.080
 I assume that because of this panceramic process

3:42:09.080 --> 3:42:11.800
 or whatever, that the probability is much,

3:42:11.800 --> 3:42:12.920
 much greater than zero.

3:42:12.920 --> 3:42:14.880
 I mean, it's not one, a hundred percent,

3:42:14.880 --> 3:42:16.520
 but it's much likelier than that,

3:42:16.520 --> 3:42:18.960
 that at least some living material from Earth

3:42:18.960 --> 3:42:22.040
 has ejaculated itself into the solar system,

3:42:22.040 --> 3:42:23.000
 into the universe, right?

3:42:23.000 --> 3:42:26.200
 Into our galaxy. Beat that, please, as well.

3:42:26.200 --> 3:42:27.040
 That's right.

3:42:27.040 --> 3:42:29.520
 So like the fact that that could happen

3:42:29.520 --> 3:42:32.240
 and that you're holding a piece from a planetary body,

3:42:32.240 --> 3:42:34.520
 one that couldn't support life as far as we know,

3:42:34.520 --> 3:42:37.560
 but next time, if you play nice

3:42:37.560 --> 3:42:39.000
 and you come on my podcast someday,

3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:40.920
 I will give you a tiny chunk of Mars.

3:42:40.920 --> 3:42:43.560
 So Mars theoretically could support stuff, right?

3:42:43.560 --> 3:42:47.080
 So yeah, so I believe that there could be remnants of Earth

3:42:47.080 --> 3:42:48.960
 so that means there could be evolution.

3:42:48.960 --> 3:42:50.200
 I don't think there's any chance

3:42:50.200 --> 3:42:52.520
 that there's people using iPhones

3:42:52.520 --> 3:42:54.960
 and having podcasts and stuff in Proxima Centauri.

3:42:54.960 --> 3:42:57.240
 There's some chance though, right?

3:42:57.240 --> 3:43:02.240
 So again, I think the simple statement to say,

3:43:02.320 --> 3:43:04.120
 it's much, much, much higher probability

3:43:04.120 --> 3:43:06.920
 that life exists than technological life exists, right?

3:43:06.920 --> 3:43:08.800
 I don't think we can argue that.

3:43:08.800 --> 3:43:09.840
 It doesn't mean it's forbidden.

3:43:09.840 --> 3:43:11.480
 Again, I'm not saying any of this is forbidden,

3:43:11.480 --> 3:43:13.040
 not worth studying, not interesting.

3:43:13.040 --> 3:43:14.080
 It's a likelihood thing.

3:43:14.080 --> 3:43:15.440
 Yeah, and to answer your,

3:43:15.440 --> 3:43:17.120
 I think you're wise to push back

3:43:17.120 --> 3:43:19.600
 and like, what does it matter what I'm doing?

3:43:19.600 --> 3:43:21.360
 And I like to think about that,

3:43:21.360 --> 3:43:23.600
 because it's like, what is the value of what you're doing?

3:43:23.600 --> 3:43:25.320
 Like you have to answer that question

3:43:25.320 --> 3:43:26.560
 or else at the end of your life,

3:43:26.560 --> 3:43:29.680
 you'll have these existential kind of crises, right?

3:43:29.680 --> 3:43:31.640
 So when I think about like who I am,

3:43:31.640 --> 3:43:33.520
 part of my identity is answering

3:43:33.520 --> 3:43:35.440
 and asking scientific questions.

3:43:35.440 --> 3:43:37.880
 For me though, there is a religious kind of undercurrent

3:43:37.880 --> 3:43:41.000
 that does undergird in some sense, this quest.

3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:42.520
 Again, I'm not like a practicing,

3:43:42.520 --> 3:43:44.040
 I'm not like wearing yarmulke,

3:43:44.040 --> 3:43:49.040
 like I'm not like full on into my birth religion, Judaism.

3:43:49.200 --> 3:43:52.040
 But at the same token, I think as,

3:43:52.040 --> 3:43:53.560
 one of the things Einstein did say is that,

3:43:53.560 --> 3:43:55.640
 religion without science is blind

3:43:55.640 --> 3:44:00.640
 or is lame and science without religion is lame,

3:44:00.720 --> 3:44:01.640
 is blind and lame.

3:44:01.640 --> 3:44:03.400
 Anyway, the point is that like,

3:44:03.400 --> 3:44:07.080
 you can't get meaning from just knowing facts.

3:44:07.080 --> 3:44:09.760
 Like Wikipedia knows more than all of us will ever know,

3:44:09.760 --> 3:44:10.600
 right?

3:44:10.600 --> 3:44:11.600
 It has no wisdom.

3:44:11.600 --> 3:44:13.480
 Wisdom, it means sapient.

3:44:13.480 --> 3:44:15.160
 The word wisdom in Latin is sapient.

3:44:15.160 --> 3:44:16.240
 We are wise.

3:44:16.240 --> 3:44:18.480
 And by the way, do you know what we're,

3:44:18.480 --> 3:44:20.840
 our real name is Homo sapiens sapient.

3:44:20.840 --> 3:44:22.760
 So it's man who knows that he knows.

3:44:22.760 --> 3:44:24.200
 Do you know what he knows?

3:44:24.200 --> 3:44:25.320
 Do you know what the knowing is?

3:44:25.320 --> 3:44:27.480
 It's that he's gonna die.

3:44:27.480 --> 3:44:29.600
 We're the only creatures that know that we are gonna die.

3:44:29.600 --> 3:44:31.400
 We don't know when we're gonna die.

3:44:31.400 --> 3:44:33.920
 But like, you know, I have a cat,

3:44:33.920 --> 3:44:36.560
 a fierce attack cat, it's beautiful.

3:44:36.560 --> 3:44:38.280
 She doesn't know when she's gonna die.

3:44:38.280 --> 3:44:40.800
 It doesn't mean I'm more valuable than I think I am.

3:44:40.800 --> 3:44:43.720
 The survival instinct is fundamentally different

3:44:43.720 --> 3:44:46.480
 from like the knowledge of death.

3:44:46.480 --> 3:44:48.120
 And that's where the Ernest Becker comes in

3:44:48.120 --> 3:44:52.080
 with the terror of death and that that's a creative force

3:44:52.080 --> 3:44:55.600
 that seems to be more feature than bug

3:44:55.600 --> 3:44:58.080
 about the human condition is that,

3:45:00.440 --> 3:45:05.080
 I mean, it's a gift of knowing our own mortality.

3:45:06.640 --> 3:45:08.920
 Yeah, to me, I mean, that's why,

3:45:09.960 --> 3:45:11.920
 I agree with you in some sense

3:45:11.920 --> 3:45:14.600
 in terms of the aliens not being a thing

3:45:14.600 --> 3:45:17.080
 that solves all mysteries.

3:45:17.080 --> 3:45:20.280
 That's why my love has always been the human mind.

3:45:20.280 --> 3:45:25.280
 So understanding who we are, what the hell are we?

3:45:25.320 --> 3:45:29.080
 And I think your love has been an echo of that,

3:45:29.080 --> 3:45:32.120
 which is where do we come from?

3:45:32.120 --> 3:45:35.200
 Or basically, as cheesy as it sounds,

3:45:36.760 --> 3:45:39.160
 Michio Kaku is away with words.

3:45:39.160 --> 3:45:42.880
 If you can just like enjoy the, you know.

3:45:42.880 --> 3:45:43.800
 Oh, he speaks in complete,

3:45:43.800 --> 3:45:45.720
 he's like Sam Harris of cosmology.

3:45:45.720 --> 3:45:47.480
 I mean, he speaks in complete paragraphs.

3:45:47.480 --> 3:45:51.560
 But like also unapologetically, he says,

3:45:51.560 --> 3:45:54.440
 we will know God or we will know the mind of God

3:45:54.440 --> 3:45:56.640
 or whatever the quotes, those kinds of things.

3:45:58.480 --> 3:46:02.160
 That's exciting that physics might be able

3:46:02.160 --> 3:46:06.520
 to find equations that unlock our origins

3:46:06.520 --> 3:46:09.160
 at the very core and like the fabric of it all too,

3:46:09.160 --> 3:46:10.680
 and not just our origins.

3:46:13.440 --> 3:46:16.880
 At the beginning, something tells me we're too dumb

3:46:16.880 --> 3:46:19.240
 to truly understand what's at the beginning, but.

3:46:19.240 --> 3:46:21.200
 I think we should be humble in that way.

3:46:21.200 --> 3:46:24.160
 I mean, again, another thing is, you know,

3:46:24.160 --> 3:46:28.320
 you ever hear the saying like we share 99% of our DNA

3:46:28.320 --> 3:46:31.320
 with chimps or bonobos or whatever?

3:46:31.320 --> 3:46:33.240
 I share like probably more than that.

3:46:33.240 --> 3:46:35.440
 Sometimes I wish we shared like 100%.

3:46:35.440 --> 3:46:37.280
 Like that'd be so much more interesting,

3:46:37.280 --> 3:46:41.160
 like, oh, there's 50% of a fruit fly or banana.

3:46:41.160 --> 3:46:42.600
 No, no, no, there's something,

3:46:42.600 --> 3:46:44.680
 but that should make us feel more precious.

3:46:44.680 --> 3:46:46.640
 And I almost feel like discovering life

3:46:46.640 --> 3:46:49.920
 on another planet, whatever solar system

3:46:49.920 --> 3:46:52.240
 would cause a diminution of humanity.

3:46:52.240 --> 3:46:54.600
 Like the one thing I do hold fast to from religion,

3:46:54.600 --> 3:46:56.000
 I don't know where I am with God.

3:46:56.000 --> 3:46:57.160
 Like, do I believe in God?

3:46:57.160 --> 3:46:59.520
 I think that's an unanswerable question,

3:47:00.640 --> 3:47:02.560
 but I have some thoughts about it.

3:47:02.560 --> 3:47:06.320
 But by the same token, I think the one thing I do get

3:47:06.320 --> 3:47:08.560
 from religion is that every human has infinite worth

3:47:08.560 --> 3:47:10.680
 because we are in a religious capacity

3:47:10.680 --> 3:47:12.640
 considered to be equal to God.

3:47:12.640 --> 3:47:15.360
 In other words, we are gods not to be like, you know,

3:47:15.360 --> 3:47:17.040
 but we can contemplate what God did.

3:47:17.040 --> 3:47:18.280
 We have aspects of God.

3:47:18.280 --> 3:47:19.120
 We have free will.

3:47:19.120 --> 3:47:21.400
 God had free will if he exists.

3:47:21.400 --> 3:47:23.040
 Again, I can't prove that God exists,

3:47:23.040 --> 3:47:24.720
 otherwise you wouldn't have any credit

3:47:24.720 --> 3:47:25.560
 for believing in God.

3:47:25.560 --> 3:47:26.380
 This is interesting.

3:47:26.380 --> 3:47:29.860
 I mean, it's like I'm talking to Einstein here,

3:47:29.860 --> 3:47:31.200
 but let me ask anyway.

3:47:31.200 --> 3:47:33.040
 Can you clip that for my clips, John?

3:47:33.040 --> 3:47:38.040
 For somebody who's looking at the young universe,

3:47:39.080 --> 3:47:44.080
 at the early universe, and are talking about God

3:47:44.080 --> 3:47:49.080
 and are agnostic, who do you think is God?

3:47:50.820 --> 3:47:54.800
 So I thought you had just like one of the best podcasts

3:47:54.800 --> 3:47:56.980
 with Sam Harris this past summer.

3:47:57.880 --> 3:48:01.000
 And one of the things I liked about that conversation

3:48:01.000 --> 3:48:04.880
 is he talked a lot about happiness and meditation.

3:48:04.880 --> 3:48:06.660
 And he said something that's really resonated with me,

3:48:06.660 --> 3:48:07.720
 and I've been working it around

3:48:07.720 --> 3:48:09.240
 and trying to work on it my own way.

3:48:09.240 --> 3:48:12.880
 But he said like, you can never be happy

3:48:12.880 --> 3:48:16.240
 if you can only become happy.

3:48:16.240 --> 3:48:18.440
 And I try to take it a little bit further than that,

3:48:18.440 --> 3:48:19.680
 because I think it's interesting.

3:48:19.680 --> 3:48:22.240
 Meditation is like, you're not like, oh, I'm happy,

3:48:22.240 --> 3:48:25.320
 and now like, oh, my kid came in and now I'm not happy.

3:48:25.320 --> 3:48:26.800
 No, you can be satisfied.

3:48:26.800 --> 3:48:28.560
 Kurt Vonnegut said, you ever catch this?

3:48:28.560 --> 3:48:30.400
 Sometimes, Alexa, you're walking around and you're like,

3:48:30.400 --> 3:48:32.800
 life is fricking amazing, I'm happy.

3:48:32.800 --> 3:48:35.440
 And Kurt Vonnegut said, you should say to yourself

3:48:35.440 --> 3:48:37.600
 every time that happens a little mantra,

3:48:37.600 --> 3:48:41.200
 if this isn't goodness, if this isn't happiness, nothing is.

3:48:41.200 --> 3:48:43.160
 Just remind yourself how awesome it is,

3:48:43.160 --> 3:48:46.080
 every breath, everything that you do when you make an impact.

3:48:46.080 --> 3:48:49.520
 Even some of the bad stuff that happens, good, it's good.

3:48:49.520 --> 3:48:51.800
 So Sam said that, and it made me think,

3:48:51.800 --> 3:48:55.040
 because I was like, well, what does it really mean

3:48:55.040 --> 3:48:56.880
 to be happy?

3:48:56.880 --> 3:49:01.880
 Because like, I can think of about two or three ways

3:49:02.200 --> 3:49:04.840
 that right now I could double my happiness.

3:49:04.840 --> 3:49:06.480
 You know, like win the lottery or whatever,

3:49:06.480 --> 3:49:07.560
 like I could double my happiness.

3:49:07.560 --> 3:49:08.940
 There's only a few ways though, right?

3:49:08.940 --> 3:49:12.760
 Like, you know, I had this kind of thought like,

3:49:12.760 --> 3:49:15.320
 how many boats can you water ski behind?

3:49:15.320 --> 3:49:17.060
 Like you had twice as many followers,

3:49:17.060 --> 3:49:19.480
 now you've got 2 million followers, 5 million, whatever.

3:49:19.480 --> 3:49:22.000
 It doesn't do anything, it's called the hedonic treadmill.

3:49:22.000 --> 3:49:23.200
 Like once you get to a certain level,

3:49:23.200 --> 3:49:26.340
 it takes a lot more, you know, change in followers,

3:49:26.340 --> 3:49:28.860
 money, impact, women, whatever you want

3:49:28.860 --> 3:49:32.280
 to make you have one more quanta of happiness, right?

3:49:32.280 --> 3:49:36.220
 On the other hand, this is a concept from entropy.

3:49:36.220 --> 3:49:39.640
 I can make your life miserable in an infinite number of ways.

3:49:39.640 --> 3:49:41.520
 In other words, there's more space

3:49:41.520 --> 3:49:44.520
 to make your life unhappy than happy.

3:49:44.520 --> 3:49:46.200
 And so I thought about that in the context

3:49:46.200 --> 3:49:48.740
 of what Sam said about happiness.

3:49:48.740 --> 3:49:52.360
 So it's sort of like, yeah, it's an expression of entropy.

3:49:52.360 --> 3:49:54.960
 And that what you should be doing in life

3:49:54.960 --> 3:49:59.040
 is doing that which will cause you devastation

3:49:59.040 --> 3:50:00.720
 if it goes away.

3:50:00.720 --> 3:50:02.680
 Because those are the things that like,

3:50:02.680 --> 3:50:05.360
 are where you're reducing entropy,

3:50:05.360 --> 3:50:08.140
 like a kid, like anyone who's a parent

3:50:08.140 --> 3:50:10.320
 knows instantly what I'm talking about.

3:50:10.320 --> 3:50:13.840
 Like how to make your life a billion times worse.

3:50:13.840 --> 3:50:16.400
 But there's no way to make your life a billion times better.

3:50:16.400 --> 3:50:17.840
 And so thinking about that,

3:50:17.840 --> 3:50:21.120
 now turning it to the question of God's existence,

3:50:21.120 --> 3:50:24.440
 I feel like there's no way that you can believe in God

3:50:24.440 --> 3:50:26.280
 to quote, misquote Sam,

3:50:26.280 --> 3:50:29.400
 but there's ways that you can become a believer in God.

3:50:29.400 --> 3:50:31.460
 In other words, you could increase

3:50:31.460 --> 3:50:34.640
 the Bayesian confidence level that there is some,

3:50:34.640 --> 3:50:36.720
 and let's not call it God because that's a freighted term.

3:50:36.720 --> 3:50:38.920
 Let's just call it some infinite source of goodness

3:50:38.920 --> 3:50:42.740
 or our beautiful power in the universe, right?

3:50:42.740 --> 3:50:44.040
 Simple things can do that.

3:50:44.040 --> 3:50:47.800
 You can increase your credulity in the goodness of life.

3:50:47.800 --> 3:50:50.480
 And we have this bias as humans towards negativity,

3:50:50.480 --> 3:50:52.120
 negativity bias, well known fact.

3:50:53.040 --> 3:50:56.280
 So what I wanna do is, let's call it God good, right?

3:50:56.280 --> 3:50:57.960
 That's where it comes from, God good,

3:50:57.960 --> 3:50:59.680
 same words in German.

3:50:59.680 --> 3:51:02.600
 And when we think about what is good,

3:51:02.600 --> 3:51:06.920
 let's do those things that would devastate us.

3:51:06.920 --> 3:51:09.920
 And a lot of that could be relationships.

3:51:09.920 --> 3:51:14.600
 And there's a powerful concept from network theory,

3:51:14.600 --> 3:51:18.160
 which is that the number of connections in a network,

3:51:18.160 --> 3:51:19.640
 you know, I'm just saying it for your own,

3:51:19.640 --> 3:51:21.680
 it grows as the square of the elements in the matrix

3:51:21.680 --> 3:51:22.640
 in the number, right?

3:51:22.640 --> 3:51:24.600
 So you think of a matrix with N people,

3:51:24.600 --> 3:51:26.560
 you know person one, two, three, four,

3:51:26.560 --> 3:51:28.000
 and then there's four other people.

3:51:28.000 --> 3:51:31.660
 There's 16 different pairs, but half of them overlap.

3:51:31.660 --> 3:51:33.280
 The diagonal is where you know each other,

3:51:33.280 --> 3:51:34.640
 you know yourself.

3:51:34.640 --> 3:51:37.060
 But that still grows as N squared.

3:51:37.060 --> 3:51:41.800
 So those connections increase and decrease, right?

3:51:41.800 --> 3:51:43.520
 You ever have two friends that are fighting

3:51:43.520 --> 3:51:44.900
 and like you're kind of upset,

3:51:44.900 --> 3:51:46.640
 even though you're not fighting with either one of them?

3:51:46.640 --> 3:51:48.420
 So like a network grows like that.

3:51:48.420 --> 3:51:50.600
 So you wanna increase your network as much as possible,

3:51:50.600 --> 3:51:54.720
 but only the kind of high quality interstices between them.

3:51:54.720 --> 3:51:56.000
 And I think in doing so,

3:51:56.000 --> 3:51:59.840
 you make yourself fragile, not anti fragile.

3:51:59.840 --> 3:52:02.400
 And I think that is where purpose

3:52:02.400 --> 3:52:05.680
 and maybe approaching some notion of God can come from.

3:52:05.680 --> 3:52:08.140
 So that is a source of meaning,

3:52:08.140 --> 3:52:11.040
 maximizing the goodness in life.

3:52:11.040 --> 3:52:13.200
 And the way you know it's good,

3:52:13.200 --> 3:52:16.640
 is if it's taken away, it would devastate you.

3:52:16.640 --> 3:52:17.480
 That's one way.

3:52:19.160 --> 3:52:21.320
 Think about it, your brand, your business,

3:52:21.320 --> 3:52:23.480
 your spouse, your kids.

3:52:23.480 --> 3:52:24.920
 I mean, parents can't count,

3:52:24.920 --> 3:52:26.760
 I've known parents that have,

3:52:26.760 --> 3:52:28.720
 Jim Simons, here's a perfect example.

3:52:28.720 --> 3:52:30.880
 He's one of my oldest friends and mentors.

3:52:31.920 --> 3:52:35.300
 He is one of the richest people on earth.

3:52:35.300 --> 3:52:37.000
 Gulf Stream, Mega Yacht,

3:52:37.000 --> 3:52:39.840
 this is all documented books about him.

3:52:39.840 --> 3:52:41.720
 He lost two sons as adults.

3:52:42.880 --> 3:52:43.960
 And I hear people say,

3:52:43.960 --> 3:52:46.400
 oh, I'm so jealous of Jim Simons.

3:52:46.400 --> 3:52:47.740
 Would you take everything?

3:52:48.720 --> 3:52:51.120
 I don't know where he has that strength

3:52:51.120 --> 3:52:53.940
 and his wife, Marilyn, and his first wife, Barbara.

3:52:54.980 --> 3:52:57.120
 I'm not like that.

3:52:57.120 --> 3:53:01.120
 Some people are, there are angels that walk among us.

3:53:01.120 --> 3:53:03.840
 And there's this famous prayer.

3:53:03.840 --> 3:53:07.600
 It's like, God, there's an old saying,

3:53:07.600 --> 3:53:09.340
 one of the hardest tests there are in life

3:53:09.340 --> 3:53:10.720
 is to be given a lot of money.

3:53:10.720 --> 3:53:13.480
 And you see it happens with people that win the lottery

3:53:13.480 --> 3:53:15.600
 or whatever, or NFL football players

3:53:15.600 --> 3:53:18.780
 after their career's over, they're broke, right?

3:53:18.780 --> 3:53:20.840
 And I was like, God, please test me with money.

3:53:20.840 --> 3:53:21.680
 That'd be great.

3:53:21.680 --> 3:53:24.840
 But in reality, you should never say,

3:53:24.840 --> 3:53:26.600
 I want what X person has.

3:53:26.600 --> 3:53:28.200
 Unless you're willing to take everything.

3:53:28.200 --> 3:53:30.640
 And you'll find you won't want to take everything.

3:53:32.760 --> 3:53:36.720
 Yeah, I think a lot about the altering effects

3:53:36.720 --> 3:53:39.900
 of fame, of money, of power on people.

3:53:44.080 --> 3:53:45.560
 It blinds people.

3:53:47.360 --> 3:53:50.280
 And I wonder about that for myself

3:53:50.280 --> 3:53:53.720
 because it seems like in themselves,

3:53:53.720 --> 3:53:55.220
 these are definitely not the goals

3:53:55.220 --> 3:53:58.160
 that I'm pretty much afraid.

3:53:58.160 --> 3:54:01.520
 I'm not desirous, and I'm definitely afraid

3:54:01.520 --> 3:54:06.520
 of each of those things, money, fame, and power.

3:54:07.240 --> 3:54:11.880
 But it seems the dreams I have as consequences

3:54:11.880 --> 3:54:14.280
 can often have these things.

3:54:14.280 --> 3:54:16.800
 And I'm really afraid of becoming something

3:54:17.720 --> 3:54:20.740
 that would disappoint me when I was younger,

3:54:20.740 --> 3:54:23.460
 that I wouldn't recognize.

3:54:23.460 --> 3:54:27.180
 You know, because change happens gradually.

3:54:27.180 --> 3:54:30.560
 But are you using yourself as the touchstone

3:54:30.560 --> 3:54:32.380
 to use the assay amount?

3:54:32.380 --> 3:54:36.060
 What is your rubric to apprise if you have lived up

3:54:36.060 --> 3:54:38.860
 to that 12 year old, whatever year old Lex?

3:54:38.860 --> 3:54:41.860
 How will you know or not know if you've let yourself down?

3:54:41.860 --> 3:54:45.060
 Or I always think, live to impress yourself.

3:54:45.060 --> 3:54:47.660
 I don't care if I have followers.

3:54:47.660 --> 3:54:49.300
 It's nice, all right, whatever.

3:54:49.300 --> 3:54:51.660
 But it's hedonic, and it's just never ending

3:54:51.660 --> 3:54:53.660
 because you'll always see the next level.

3:54:53.660 --> 3:54:54.840
 But I think it's pretty damn cool

3:54:54.840 --> 3:54:57.300
 that I've gotten to go to these places, the South Pole,

3:54:57.300 --> 3:54:59.580
 and I've done these things, and I've made a family,

3:54:59.580 --> 3:55:04.000
 and I'm able to teleport my values into the future

3:55:04.000 --> 3:55:07.340
 through my children, and I've had ideological children.

3:55:08.260 --> 3:55:11.180
 So by what metric have you not already,

3:55:11.180 --> 3:55:13.300
 A, impressed yourself, and B, could you let yourself down?

3:55:13.300 --> 3:55:14.380
 I don't want to turn to the therapist.

3:55:14.380 --> 3:55:15.940
 I think some of it is psychology.

3:55:15.940 --> 3:55:20.940
 For me, I'm very much just never highly self critical.

3:55:20.940 --> 3:55:24.300
 I'm never happy, never happy with what I've done.

3:55:24.300 --> 3:55:27.020
 But I'm always happy in the way that you describe,

3:55:27.020 --> 3:55:29.860
 which is that the Vonnegut thing,

3:55:29.860 --> 3:55:34.020
 where you just, often during the day, I will feel,

3:55:34.020 --> 3:55:39.020
 I don't know, I just remember just eating beef jerky

3:55:39.180 --> 3:55:40.820
 and being truly happy.

3:55:40.820 --> 3:55:44.620
 That was just last night, and I have that all the time.

3:55:44.620 --> 3:55:48.900
 And that, to me, is why, I mean,

3:55:48.900 --> 3:55:51.260
 that feels to me like a healthy way to live life,

3:55:51.260 --> 3:55:55.020
 and at least for me, it's the one I really enjoy.

3:55:55.020 --> 3:55:57.620
 A lot of people tell me that maybe being so self critical,

3:55:57.620 --> 3:56:00.480
 so hard on yourself, is not a good way to go.

3:56:00.480 --> 3:56:02.140
 But more and more as I get older,

3:56:02.140 --> 3:56:04.580
 I realize it's just who I am.

3:56:04.580 --> 3:56:08.000
 You have to a certain point accept,

3:56:08.000 --> 3:56:10.700
 this is how I'm always going to be this self critical.

3:56:10.700 --> 3:56:12.140
 It's like the Oracle of Delphi, right?

3:56:12.140 --> 3:56:13.780
 You know thyself.

3:56:13.780 --> 3:56:15.060
 But I want to leave you with one last thing,

3:56:15.060 --> 3:56:16.980
 which is to say, just on this topic,

3:56:16.980 --> 3:56:19.940
 you know, it could be different, right?

3:56:19.940 --> 3:56:22.780
 We could go down to the ocean and get some krill

3:56:22.780 --> 3:56:24.460
 instead of the 711.

3:56:24.460 --> 3:56:28.340
 You know, it could be that we have no other taste buds.

3:56:28.340 --> 3:56:31.220
 And you know, Eric's talked about the four dimensions

3:56:31.220 --> 3:56:33.420
 of the vibration of your tongue, right?

3:56:33.420 --> 3:56:35.900
 It could be like there's one,

3:56:35.900 --> 3:56:39.420
 and it's just like, not Memphis barbecue,

3:56:39.420 --> 3:56:42.700
 whatever you like in your Slim Jim.

3:56:42.700 --> 3:56:44.420
 It could be something, it could be very boring.

3:56:44.420 --> 3:56:47.260
 Similarly, what if like that's a clue?

3:56:47.260 --> 3:56:49.060
 Like what if that's giving us evidence?

3:56:49.060 --> 3:56:50.660
 Here's another clue.

3:56:50.660 --> 3:56:51.520
 There are many animals,

3:56:51.520 --> 3:56:54.380
 most animals have single monocolor vision.

3:56:54.380 --> 3:56:56.940
 They only see in black and white intensity.

3:56:56.940 --> 3:56:59.040
 They only have rods and no cones.

3:57:00.560 --> 3:57:03.060
 We could be like that, but we're not.

3:57:03.060 --> 3:57:04.900
 Why is that not a clue?

3:57:04.900 --> 3:57:08.980
 Like if, like God's not going to like hit you over the head

3:57:08.980 --> 3:57:10.080
 and say like, here I am.

3:57:10.080 --> 3:57:11.360
 Cause then everybody would believe in him.

3:57:11.360 --> 3:57:12.340
 And there's very simplistic.

3:57:12.340 --> 3:57:14.180
 I've had debates even with like famous atheists,

3:57:14.180 --> 3:57:15.500
 like Lawrence Krauss.

3:57:15.500 --> 3:57:17.640
 He's like self declared militant atheist.

3:57:18.560 --> 3:57:20.940
 And I was like, well, I don't believe in the same God

3:57:20.940 --> 3:57:21.860
 you don't believe in.

3:57:21.860 --> 3:57:24.140
 Like some guy in a white beard and a chair,

3:57:24.140 --> 3:57:25.460
 like that's infantile.

3:57:25.460 --> 3:57:27.960
 Like I gave that away a long time ago.

3:57:27.960 --> 3:57:29.380
 But what if there are clues?

3:57:29.380 --> 3:57:31.840
 What if Yang Mills theory and you know,

3:57:31.840 --> 3:57:33.220
 Maxwell's equation, like what?

3:57:33.220 --> 3:57:35.060
 Those are beautiful.

3:57:35.060 --> 3:57:37.100
 If you've ever seen like, you know,

3:57:37.100 --> 3:57:39.840
 expressed in tensor notation, Einstein's equations

3:57:39.840 --> 3:57:41.620
 or Maxwell's equations or,

3:57:41.620 --> 3:57:44.940
 and then Maxwell's equations riding on Einstein's,

3:57:44.940 --> 3:57:47.740
 it's unbelievably beautiful.

3:57:47.740 --> 3:57:49.420
 Doesn't have to be that way.

3:57:49.420 --> 3:57:51.260
 That we can comprehend it.

3:57:51.260 --> 3:57:52.540
 That's a crack.

3:57:52.540 --> 3:57:54.020
 Maybe that's where the light gets in.

3:57:54.020 --> 3:57:56.940
 And the light is what reveals what's beautiful.

3:57:56.940 --> 3:57:59.060
 So I don't believe in God.

3:57:59.060 --> 3:58:00.380
 I think that's a stupid notion.

3:58:00.380 --> 3:58:01.740
 Like, do I believe in God?

3:58:01.740 --> 3:58:04.860
 Like sometimes I wonder if God believes in me,

3:58:04.860 --> 3:58:06.060
 like more than if I believe in,

3:58:06.060 --> 3:58:07.420
 like he needs Brian Keating.

3:58:07.420 --> 3:58:11.180
 Like, you know, it's like one of my friends is a rapper.

3:58:11.180 --> 3:58:14.820
 He's like, what would I be doing if I were God?

3:58:14.820 --> 3:58:16.140
 Exactly what God's doing right now.

3:58:16.140 --> 3:58:17.780
 Like, you think I know more than God?

3:58:17.780 --> 3:58:18.620
 Give me a break.

3:58:18.620 --> 3:58:23.340
 Leaving clues of beauty for these hairless apes.

3:58:23.340 --> 3:58:24.180
 Yeah.

3:58:24.180 --> 3:58:26.180
 And to see what they do with this.

3:58:26.180 --> 3:58:31.180
 And then marvel at both the tragedy

3:58:31.620 --> 3:58:34.580
 of what those apes do to each other

3:58:34.580 --> 3:58:41.580
 and the rare moments of when they understand deeply

3:58:41.580 --> 3:58:43.460
 about how the world works.

3:58:43.460 --> 3:58:45.300
 Brian, you're an incredible human being.

3:58:45.300 --> 3:58:48.540
 I'm a big fan and I'm really honored that he was,

3:58:48.540 --> 3:58:51.820
 first of all, showered me with rocks from the moon.

3:58:51.820 --> 3:58:52.780
 From space.

3:58:52.780 --> 3:58:53.780
 From space.

3:58:53.780 --> 3:58:54.620
 Space dust.

3:58:54.620 --> 3:58:55.460
 Space dust.

3:58:55.460 --> 3:58:56.300
 The villains.

3:58:56.300 --> 3:58:59.180
 Crystals, magical crystals, healing crystals.

3:58:59.180 --> 3:59:00.020
 Yeah.

3:59:00.020 --> 3:59:01.820
 That you can use for good.

3:59:01.820 --> 3:59:05.100
 And tell me your story and spend your really valuable time

3:59:05.100 --> 3:59:05.940
 with me today.

3:59:05.940 --> 3:59:06.780
 This was amazing.

3:59:06.780 --> 3:59:08.020
 That was a great pleasure for me, Lex.

3:59:08.020 --> 3:59:08.860
 Thank you so much.

3:59:10.020 --> 3:59:11.700
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

3:59:11.700 --> 3:59:12.860
 with Brian Keating.

 And now, let me leave you with some words

3:59:19.420 --> 3:59:21.100
 from Galileo Galilei.

3:59:21.980 --> 3:59:25.340
 In questions of science, the authority of a thousand

3:59:25.340 --> 3:59:29.660
 is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual.

3:59:29.660 --> 3:59:32.620
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
