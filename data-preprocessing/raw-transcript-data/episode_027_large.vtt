00:00.000 --> 00:02.920
 The following is a conversation with Kai Fu Lee.

00:02.920 --> 00:06.560
 He's the chairman and CEO of Cinovation Ventures

00:06.560 --> 00:10.600
 that manages a $2 billion dual currency investment fund

00:10.600 --> 00:13.160
 with a focus on developing the next generation

00:13.160 --> 00:15.440
 of Chinese high tech companies.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.880
 He's the former president of Google China

00:17.880 --> 00:19.800
 and the founder of what is now called

00:19.800 --> 00:21.680
 Microsoft Research Asia,

00:21.680 --> 00:24.920
 an institute that trained many of the artificial

00:24.920 --> 00:26.520
 intelligence leaders in China,

00:26.520 --> 00:30.280
 including CTOs or AI execs at Baidu,

00:30.280 --> 00:33.920
 Tencent, Alibaba, Lenovo, and Huawei.

00:34.840 --> 00:38.520
 He was named one of the 100 most influential people

00:38.520 --> 00:40.480
 in the world by Time Magazine.

00:40.480 --> 00:43.840
 He's the author of seven bestselling books in Chinese

00:43.840 --> 00:46.680
 and most recently, the New York Times bestseller

00:46.680 --> 00:50.600
 called AI Superpowers, China, Silicon Valley,

00:50.600 --> 00:52.600
 and the New World Order.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.760
 He has unparalleled experience

00:55.760 --> 00:57.640
 in working across major tech companies

00:57.640 --> 01:00.040
 and governments and applications of AI,

01:00.040 --> 01:03.440
 and so he has a unique perspective on global innovation

01:03.440 --> 01:06.200
 and the future of AI that I think is important

01:06.200 --> 01:08.880
 to listen to and think about.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.880
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:17.920 --> 01:20.960
 on Twitter at Lex Friedman.

01:20.960 --> 01:25.960
 And now, here's my conversation with Kaifu Li.

01:26.040 --> 01:29.360
 I immigrated from Russia to US when I was 13.

01:29.360 --> 01:32.400
 You immigrated to US at about the same age.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.720
 The Russian people, the American people,

01:34.720 --> 01:38.240
 the Chinese people each have a certain soul,

01:38.240 --> 01:42.000
 a spirit that permeates throughout the generations.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.080
 So maybe it's a little bit of a poetic question,

01:45.080 --> 01:48.840
 but could you describe your sense

01:48.840 --> 01:52.000
 of what defines the Chinese soul?

01:52.000 --> 01:56.080
 I think the Chinese soul of people today, right,

01:56.080 --> 02:01.080
 we're talking about people who have had centuries of burden

02:01.920 --> 02:05.120
 because of the poverty that the country has gone through,

02:05.120 --> 02:10.120
 and suddenly shined with hope of prosperity

02:10.480 --> 02:13.360
 in the past 40 years as China opened up

02:13.360 --> 02:15.400
 and embraced market economy.

02:15.400 --> 02:20.160
 And undoubtedly, there are two sets of pressures

02:20.160 --> 02:24.120
 on the people, that of the tradition,

02:24.120 --> 02:28.000
 that of facing difficult situations,

02:28.000 --> 02:31.120
 and that of hope of wanting to be the first

02:31.120 --> 02:33.840
 to become successful and wealthy.

02:33.840 --> 02:38.320
 So that's a very strong hunger and a strong desire

02:38.320 --> 02:41.120
 and strong work ethic that drives China forward.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.920
 And is there roots to not just this generation,

02:43.920 --> 02:47.280
 but before that's deeper

02:47.280 --> 02:50.080
 than just the new economic developments?

02:50.080 --> 02:52.520
 Is there something that's unique to China

02:52.520 --> 02:54.960
 that you could speak to that's in the people?

02:54.960 --> 02:58.560
 Yeah, well, the Chinese tradition

02:58.560 --> 03:02.640
 is about excellence, dedication, and results.

03:02.640 --> 03:07.200
 And the Chinese exams and study subjects in schools

03:07.200 --> 03:09.120
 have traditionally started

03:09.120 --> 03:11.080
 from memorizing 10,000 characters,

03:11.080 --> 03:13.560
 not an easy task to start with.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.120
 And further by memorizing

03:15.120 --> 03:18.960
 his historic philosopher's literature poetry.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.080
 So it really is probably

03:21.080 --> 03:25.040
 the strongest rote learning mechanism created

03:25.040 --> 03:26.920
 to make sure people had good memory

03:26.920 --> 03:29.120
 and remember things extremely well.

03:30.080 --> 03:32.680
 That's, I think at the same time,

03:32.680 --> 03:36.120
 suppresses the breakthrough innovation

03:37.360 --> 03:42.360
 and also enhances the speed execution get results.

03:42.360 --> 03:44.400
 And that I think characterizes

03:44.400 --> 03:47.280
 the historic basis of China.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.120
 That's interesting,

03:48.120 --> 03:50.200
 because there's echoes of that in Russian education

03:50.200 --> 03:51.960
 as well as rote memorization.

03:51.960 --> 03:53.680
 So you have to memorize a lot of poetry.

03:53.680 --> 03:58.680
 I mean, there's just an emphasis on perfection in all forms

03:59.120 --> 04:02.120
 that's not conducive to perhaps what you're speaking to,

04:02.120 --> 04:03.560
 which is creativity.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.880
 But you think that kind of education holds back

04:06.880 --> 04:09.400
 the innovative spirit that you might see

04:09.400 --> 04:10.840
 in the United States?

04:10.840 --> 04:14.720
 Well, it holds back the breakthrough innovative spirits

04:14.720 --> 04:16.360
 that we see in the United States,

04:16.360 --> 04:21.360
 but it does not hold back the valuable execution oriented,

04:21.760 --> 04:25.120
 result oriented value creating engines,

04:25.120 --> 04:27.840
 which we see China being very successful.

04:27.840 --> 04:32.760
 So is there a difference between a Chinese AI engineer today

04:32.760 --> 04:34.680
 and an American AI engineer,

04:34.680 --> 04:36.920
 perhaps rooted in the culture that we just talked about

04:36.920 --> 04:41.040
 or the education or the very soul of the people or no?

04:41.040 --> 04:43.600
 And what would your advice be to each

04:43.600 --> 04:45.400
 if there's a difference?

04:45.400 --> 04:47.000
 Well, there's a lot that's similar

04:47.000 --> 04:51.120
 because AI is about mastering sciences,

04:51.120 --> 04:54.760
 about using known technologies and trying new things,

04:54.760 --> 04:58.120
 but it's also about picking from many parts

04:58.120 --> 05:00.160
 of possible networks to use

05:00.160 --> 05:02.800
 and different types of parameters to tune.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.200
 And that part is somewhat rote.

05:05.200 --> 05:08.880
 And it is also, as anyone who's built AI products

05:08.880 --> 05:12.560
 can tell you a lot about cleansing the data

05:12.560 --> 05:15.080
 because AI runs better with more data

05:15.080 --> 05:18.480
 and data is generally unstructured,

05:18.480 --> 05:22.280
 errorful and unclean.

05:22.280 --> 05:26.160
 And the effort to clean the data is immense.

05:26.160 --> 05:31.160
 So I think the better part of American engineering,

05:31.160 --> 05:35.520
 AI engineering process is to try new things,

05:35.520 --> 05:37.960
 to do things people haven't done before

05:37.960 --> 05:42.960
 and to use technology to solve most if not all problems.

05:43.360 --> 05:47.120
 So to make the algorithm work despite not so great data,

05:47.120 --> 05:50.640
 find error tolerant ways to deal with the data.

05:50.640 --> 05:55.640
 The Chinese way would be to basically enumerate

05:55.920 --> 05:58.560
 to the fullest extent all the possible ways

05:58.560 --> 06:01.000
 by a lot of machines, try lots of different ways

06:01.000 --> 06:04.560
 to get it to work and spend a lot of resources

06:04.560 --> 06:07.680
 and money and time cleaning up data.

06:07.680 --> 06:10.960
 That means the AI engineer may be writing

06:10.960 --> 06:15.560
 data cleansing algorithms, working with thousands of people

06:15.560 --> 06:19.120
 who label or correct or do things with the data.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.680
 That is the incredible hard work

06:21.680 --> 06:23.960
 that might lead to better results.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.360
 So the Chinese engineer would rely on

06:26.360 --> 06:29.040
 and ask for more and more and more data

06:29.040 --> 06:31.440
 and find ways to cleanse them and make them work

06:31.440 --> 06:34.480
 in the system and probably less time thinking

06:34.480 --> 06:38.520
 about new algorithms that can overcome data

06:38.520 --> 06:39.640
 or other issues.

06:39.640 --> 06:40.840
 So where's your intuition?

06:40.840 --> 06:42.320
 Where do you think the biggest impact

06:42.320 --> 06:44.160
 in the next 10 years lies?

06:44.160 --> 06:46.480
 Is it in some breakthrough algorithms

06:47.360 --> 06:52.360
 or is it in just this at scale rigor,

06:53.160 --> 06:55.920
 a rigorous approach to data, cleaning data,

06:55.920 --> 06:58.440
 organizing data onto the same algorithms?

06:58.440 --> 07:02.600
 What do you think the big impact in the applied world is?

07:02.600 --> 07:04.560
 Well, if you're really in the company

07:04.560 --> 07:06.880
 and you have to deliver results,

07:06.880 --> 07:09.720
 using known techniques and enhancing data

07:09.720 --> 07:12.240
 seems like the more expedient approach

07:12.240 --> 07:15.680
 that's very low risk and likely to generate

07:15.680 --> 07:17.200
 better and better results.

07:17.200 --> 07:20.520
 And that's why the Chinese approach has done quite well.

07:20.520 --> 07:24.280
 Now, there are a lot of more challenging startups

07:24.280 --> 07:28.480
 and problems such as autonomous vehicles,

07:28.480 --> 07:32.080
 medical diagnosis that existing algorithms

07:32.080 --> 07:34.280
 probably won't solve.

07:34.280 --> 07:38.720
 And that would put the Chinese approach more challenged

07:38.720 --> 07:42.400
 and give them more breakthrough innovation approach,

07:42.400 --> 07:45.440
 more of an edge on those kinds of problems.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.080
 So let me talk to that a little more.

07:47.080 --> 07:51.000
 So my intuition personally is that data

07:51.000 --> 07:53.680
 can take us extremely far.

07:53.680 --> 07:56.480
 So you brought up autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis.

07:56.480 --> 08:00.080
 So your intuition is that huge amounts of data

08:00.080 --> 08:04.000
 might not be able to completely help us solve that problem.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.080
 Right, so breaking that down further in autonomous vehicle,

08:08.080 --> 08:11.280
 I think huge amounts of data probably will solve

08:11.280 --> 08:13.000
 trucks driving on highways,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.600
 which will deliver a significant value

08:15.600 --> 08:18.120
 and China will probably lead in that.

08:18.120 --> 08:23.120
 And full L5 autonomous is likely to require

08:23.960 --> 08:26.320
 new technologies we don't yet know.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.640
 And that might require academia

08:28.640 --> 08:30.360
 and great industrial research,

08:30.360 --> 08:32.480
 both innovating and working together.

08:32.480 --> 08:35.360
 And in that case, US has an advantage.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.200
 So the interesting question there is,

08:37.200 --> 08:38.240
 I don't know if you're familiar

08:38.240 --> 08:39.720
 on the autonomous vehicle space

08:39.720 --> 08:42.640
 and the developments with Tesla and Elon Musk.

08:42.640 --> 08:43.480
 I am.

08:43.480 --> 08:48.080
 Where they are in fact full steam ahead

08:49.400 --> 08:53.480
 into this mysterious complex world of full autonomy, L5,

08:53.480 --> 08:58.480
 L4, L5, and they're trying to solve that purely with data.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.800
 So the same kind of thing that you're saying

09:00.800 --> 09:02.080
 is just for highway,

09:02.080 --> 09:05.320
 which is what a lot of people share your intuition.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.200
 They're trying to solve with data.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.320
 So just to linger on that moment further,

09:09.320 --> 09:13.560
 do you think possible for them to achieve success

09:13.560 --> 09:17.040
 with simply just a huge amount of this training

09:17.040 --> 09:20.400
 on edge cases and difficult cases in urban environments,

09:20.400 --> 09:21.760
 not just highway and so on?

09:22.760 --> 09:24.520
 I think it would be very hard.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.040
 One could characterize Tesla's approach

09:27.040 --> 09:29.840
 as kind of a Chinese strength approach, right?

09:29.840 --> 09:31.560
 Gather all the data you can

09:31.560 --> 09:34.000
 and hope that will overcome the problems.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.080
 But in autonomous driving,

09:36.080 --> 09:40.400
 clearly a lot of the decisions aren't merely solved

09:40.400 --> 09:43.480
 by aggregating data and having feedback loop.

09:43.480 --> 09:48.000
 There are things that are more akin to human thinking.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.640
 And how would those be integrated and built?

09:51.640 --> 09:53.960
 There has not yet been a lot of success

09:53.960 --> 09:56.400
 integrating human intelligence

09:56.400 --> 09:58.760
 or call it expert systems if you will,

09:58.760 --> 10:02.920
 even though that's a taboo word with the machine learning.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.560
 And the integration of the two types of thinking

10:05.560 --> 10:07.800
 hasn't yet been demonstrated.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.920
 And the question is how much can you push

10:09.920 --> 10:12.360
 a purely machine learning approach?

10:12.360 --> 10:15.480
 And of course, Tesla also has an additional constraint

10:15.480 --> 10:18.480
 that they don't have all the sensors.

10:18.480 --> 10:21.120
 I know that they think it's foolish to use LIDARs,

10:21.120 --> 10:25.080
 but that's clearly a one less very valuable

10:25.080 --> 10:28.880
 and reliable source of input that they're foregoing,

10:28.880 --> 10:31.120
 which may also have consequences.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.960
 I think the advantage of course is capturing data

10:34.960 --> 10:37.080
 that no one has ever seen before.

10:37.080 --> 10:40.680
 And in some cases such as computer vision

10:40.680 --> 10:42.240
 and speech recognition,

10:42.240 --> 10:44.880
 I have seen Chinese companies accumulate data

10:44.880 --> 10:47.360
 that's not seen anywhere in the Western world

10:47.360 --> 10:50.280
 and they have delivered superior results.

10:50.280 --> 10:53.760
 But then speech recognition and object recognition

10:53.760 --> 10:57.120
 are relatively suitable problems for deep learning

10:57.120 --> 11:00.800
 and don't have the potentially need

11:00.800 --> 11:04.480
 for the human intelligence analytical planning elements.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.440
 And the same on the speech recognition side,

11:06.440 --> 11:08.960
 your intuition that speech recognition

11:08.960 --> 11:11.480
 and the machine learning approaches to speech recognition

11:11.480 --> 11:14.520
 won't take us to a conversational system

11:14.520 --> 11:15.960
 that can pass the Turing test,

11:15.960 --> 11:20.080
 which is sort of maybe akin to what driving is.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.760
 So it needs to have something more than just simply

11:24.480 --> 11:27.520
 simple language understanding, simple language generation.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.720
 Roughly right.

11:28.720 --> 11:33.120
 I would say that based on purely machine learning approaches,

11:33.120 --> 11:35.960
 it's hard to imagine it could lead

11:35.960 --> 11:40.520
 to a full conversational experience

11:40.520 --> 11:44.600
 across arbitrary domains, which is akin to L5.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.920
 I'm a little hesitant to use the word Turing test

11:46.920 --> 11:50.280
 because the original definition was probably too easy.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.320
 We probably do that, yeah.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.400
 The spirit of the Turing test

11:54.400 --> 11:56.520
 is what I was referring to. Of course.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.440
 So you've had major leadership research positions

11:59.440 --> 12:01.640
 at Apple, Microsoft, Google.

12:01.640 --> 12:05.120
 So continuing on the discussion of America, Russia,

12:05.120 --> 12:07.640
 Chinese, Seoul and culture and so on.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.360
 What is the culture of Silicon Valley

12:12.440 --> 12:16.320
 in contrast to China and maybe US broadly?

12:16.320 --> 12:18.760
 And what is the unique culture

12:18.760 --> 12:22.080
 of each of these three major companies in your view?

12:22.080 --> 12:25.120
 I think in aggregate, Silicon Valley companies,

12:25.120 --> 12:27.200
 and we could probably include Microsoft in that,

12:27.200 --> 12:29.120
 even though they're not in the Valley,

12:29.120 --> 12:33.960
 is really dream big and have visionary goals

12:33.960 --> 12:37.960
 and believe that technology will conquer all.

12:37.960 --> 12:42.280
 And also the self confidence and the self entitlement

12:42.280 --> 12:43.560
 that whatever they produce,

12:43.560 --> 12:47.240
 the whole world should use and must use.

12:47.240 --> 12:52.240
 And those are historically important, I think.

12:54.080 --> 12:59.080
 Steve Jobs famous quote that he doesn't do focus groups,

12:59.080 --> 13:02.360
 he looks in the mirror and asks the person in the mirror,

13:02.360 --> 13:03.520
 what do you want?

13:03.520 --> 13:07.880
 And that really is an inspirational comment that says,

13:07.880 --> 13:11.240
 the great company shouldn't just ask users what they want,

13:11.240 --> 13:15.160
 but develop something that users will know they want

13:15.160 --> 13:16.200
 when they see it,

13:16.200 --> 13:18.920
 but they could never come up with themselves.

13:18.920 --> 13:23.840
 I think that is probably the most exhilarating description

13:23.840 --> 13:26.520
 of what the essence of Silicon Valley is,

13:26.520 --> 13:31.520
 that this brilliant idea could cause you to build something

13:31.800 --> 13:35.480
 that couldn't come out of the focus groups or AB tests.

13:35.480 --> 13:38.000
 And iPhone would be an example of that.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.520
 No one in the age of Blackberry would write down

13:40.520 --> 13:42.760
 they want an iPhone or multi touch.

13:42.760 --> 13:44.760
 A browser might be another example.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.480
 No one would say they want that in the days of FTP,

13:47.480 --> 13:49.400
 but once they see it, they want it.

13:49.400 --> 13:53.560
 So I think that is what Silicon Valley is best at.

13:53.560 --> 13:58.560
 But it also comes with, it came with a lot of success.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.960
 These products became global platforms

14:01.960 --> 14:05.120
 and there were basically no competitors anywhere.

14:05.120 --> 14:08.440
 And that has also led to a belief

14:08.440 --> 14:13.240
 that these are the only things that one should do,

14:13.240 --> 14:17.960
 that companies should not tread on other companies territory

14:17.960 --> 14:22.960
 so that a Groupon and a Yelp and then OpenTable

14:24.080 --> 14:26.280
 and the Grubhub would each feel,

14:26.280 --> 14:28.560
 okay, I'm not gonna do the other company's business

14:28.560 --> 14:32.360
 because that would not be the pride of innovating

14:33.280 --> 14:35.880
 what each of these four companies have innovated.

14:36.920 --> 14:40.320
 But I think the Chinese approach

14:40.320 --> 14:42.720
 is do whatever it takes to win.

14:42.720 --> 14:45.000
 And it's a winner take all market.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.200
 And in fact, in the internet space,

14:47.200 --> 14:50.880
 the market leader will get predominantly all the value

14:50.880 --> 14:53.320
 extracted out of the system.

14:53.320 --> 14:57.840
 So, and the system isn't just defined

14:57.840 --> 15:01.360
 as one narrow category, but gets broader and broader.

15:01.360 --> 15:06.360
 So it's amazing ambition for success and domination

15:07.960 --> 15:11.760
 of increasingly larger product categories

15:11.760 --> 15:15.080
 leading to clear market winner status

15:15.080 --> 15:19.080
 and the opportunity to extract tremendous value.

15:19.080 --> 15:24.080
 And that develops a practical, result oriented,

15:25.840 --> 15:30.840
 ultra ambitious winner take all gladiatorial mentality.

15:31.480 --> 15:36.480
 And if what it takes is to build what the competitors built,

15:37.400 --> 15:40.000
 essentially a copycat that can be done

15:40.000 --> 15:41.920
 without infringing laws.

15:41.920 --> 15:46.280
 If what it takes is to satisfy a foreign country's need

15:46.280 --> 15:48.480
 by forking the code base and building something

15:48.480 --> 15:51.400
 that looks really ugly and different, they'll do it.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.360
 So it's contrasted very sharply

15:54.360 --> 15:56.240
 with the Silicon Valley approach.

15:56.240 --> 16:00.040
 And I think the flexibility and the speed and execution

16:00.040 --> 16:01.960
 has helped the Chinese approach.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.080
 And I think the Silicon Valley approach

16:05.040 --> 16:10.040
 is potentially challenged if every Chinese entrepreneur

16:10.040 --> 16:13.240
 is learning from the whole world, US and China,

16:13.240 --> 16:16.320
 and the American entrepreneurs only look internally

16:16.320 --> 16:19.640
 and write off China as a copycat.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.360
 And the second part of your question

16:21.360 --> 16:23.560
 about the three companies.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.080
 The unique elements of the three companies perhaps.

16:26.080 --> 16:30.440
 Yeah, I think Apple represents

16:30.440 --> 16:33.160
 while the user please the user

16:33.160 --> 16:38.160
 and the essence of design and brand

16:38.160 --> 16:43.160
 and it's the one company and perhaps the only tech company

16:43.640 --> 16:48.640
 that draws people with a strong, serious desire

16:49.440 --> 16:53.080
 for the product and the willingness to pay a premium

16:53.080 --> 16:56.440
 because of the halo effect of the brand

16:56.440 --> 16:59.640
 which came from the attention to detail

16:59.640 --> 17:01.760
 and great respect for user needs.

17:01.760 --> 17:06.760
 Microsoft represents a platform approach

17:07.680 --> 17:12.680
 that builds giant products that become very strong modes

17:12.760 --> 17:17.280
 that others can't do because it's well architected

17:17.280 --> 17:22.280
 at the bottom level and the work is efficiently delegated

17:23.640 --> 17:28.640
 to individuals and then the whole product is built

17:28.640 --> 17:32.000
 by adding small parts that sum together.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.520
 So it's probably the most effective high tech assembly line

17:36.520 --> 17:38.760
 that builds a very difficult product

17:38.760 --> 17:43.040
 that and the whole process of doing that

17:43.040 --> 17:48.040
 is kind of a differentiation and something competitors

17:49.040 --> 17:50.800
 can't easily repeat.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.080
 Are there elements of the Chinese approach

17:53.080 --> 17:56.640
 in the way Microsoft went about assembling

17:56.640 --> 17:59.000
 those little pieces and dominating,

17:59.000 --> 18:02.320
 essentially dominating the market for a long time

18:02.320 --> 18:04.040
 or do you see those as distinct?

18:04.040 --> 18:06.680
 I think there are elements that are the same.

18:06.680 --> 18:09.520
 I think the three American companies that had

18:09.520 --> 18:12.960
 or have Chinese characteristics and obviously

18:12.960 --> 18:16.280
 as well as American characteristics are Microsoft,

18:16.280 --> 18:18.720
 Facebook and Amazon.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.160
 Yes, that's right, Amazon.

18:20.160 --> 18:23.920
 Because these are companies that will tenaciously

18:23.920 --> 18:27.640
 go after adjacent markets,

18:27.640 --> 18:32.640
 build up strong product offering and find ways

18:34.360 --> 18:37.960
 to extract greater value from a sphere

18:37.960 --> 18:41.480
 that's ever increasing and they understand

18:41.480 --> 18:43.520
 the value of the platforms.

18:43.520 --> 18:47.280
 So that's the similarity and then with Google,

18:47.280 --> 18:52.280
 I think it's a genuinely value oriented company

18:54.800 --> 18:57.000
 that does have a heart and soul

18:57.000 --> 18:59.800
 and that wants to do great things for the world

18:59.800 --> 19:01.920
 by connecting information

19:01.920 --> 19:06.920
 and that has also very strong technology genes

19:08.840 --> 19:13.280
 and wants to use technology

19:13.280 --> 19:18.280
 and has found out of the box ways to use technology

19:19.120 --> 19:23.720
 to deliver incredible value to the end user.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.240
 If you can look at Google, for example,

19:25.240 --> 19:26.760
 you mentioned heart and soul.

19:28.040 --> 19:31.840
 There seems to be an element where Google

19:31.840 --> 19:34.840
 is after making the world better.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.920
 There's a more positive view.

19:36.920 --> 19:39.280
 They used to have the slogan, don't be evil.

19:39.280 --> 19:43.120
 And Facebook a little bit more has a negative tend to it.

19:43.120 --> 19:45.760
 At least in the perception of privacy and so on.

19:45.760 --> 19:50.760
 Do you have a sense of how these different companies

19:51.080 --> 19:53.040
 can achieve, because you've talked about

19:53.040 --> 19:54.520
 how much we can make the world better

19:54.520 --> 19:56.760
 in all these kinds of ways with AI.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.360
 What is it about a company that can make,

19:59.360 --> 20:03.200
 give it a heart and soul, gain the trust of the public

20:03.200 --> 20:06.120
 and just actually just not be evil

20:06.120 --> 20:08.000
 and do good for the world?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.240
 It's really hard and I think Google

20:10.240 --> 20:13.120
 has struggled with that.

20:13.120 --> 20:16.720
 First, the don't do evil mantra is very dangerous

20:16.720 --> 20:20.800
 because every employee's definition of evil is different.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.600
 And that has led to some difficult

20:22.600 --> 20:25.120
 employee situations for them.

20:25.120 --> 20:29.560
 So I don't necessarily think that's a good value statement,

20:29.560 --> 20:32.320
 but just watching the kinds of things Google

20:32.320 --> 20:35.320
 or its parent company Alphabet does

20:35.320 --> 20:40.320
 in new areas like healthcare, like eradicating mosquitoes,

20:40.480 --> 20:42.360
 things that are really not in the business

20:42.360 --> 20:44.520
 of a internet tech company.

20:44.520 --> 20:47.200
 I think that shows that there's a heart and soul

20:47.200 --> 20:50.360
 and desire to do good and willingness

20:50.360 --> 20:54.800
 to put in the resources to do something

20:54.800 --> 20:57.240
 when they see it's good, they will pursue it.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.160
 That doesn't necessarily mean

21:00.160 --> 21:02.480
 it has all the trust of the users.

21:02.480 --> 21:06.360
 I realize while most people would view Facebook

21:06.360 --> 21:09.760
 as the primary target of their recent unhappiness

21:09.760 --> 21:11.560
 about Silicon Valley companies,

21:11.560 --> 21:14.040
 many would put Google in that category.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.760
 And some have named Google's business practices

21:16.760 --> 21:19.720
 as predatory also.

21:19.720 --> 21:24.240
 So it's kind of difficult to have the two parts of a body.

21:24.240 --> 21:27.440
 The brain wants to do what it's supposed to do

21:27.440 --> 21:29.280
 for a shareholder, maximize profit.

21:29.280 --> 21:32.000
 And then the heart and soul wants to do good things

21:32.000 --> 21:36.120
 that may run against what the brain wants to do.

21:36.120 --> 21:39.000
 So in this complex balancing

21:39.000 --> 21:40.320
 that these companies have to do,

21:40.320 --> 21:42.480
 you've mentioned that you're concerned

21:42.480 --> 21:45.480
 about a future where too few companies

21:45.480 --> 21:49.640
 like Google, Facebook, Amazon are controlling our data

21:49.640 --> 21:53.360
 or controlling too much of our digital lives.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.840
 Can you elaborate on this concern

21:54.840 --> 21:57.560
 and perhaps do you have a better way forward?

21:57.560 --> 22:02.560
 I think I'm hardly the most vocal complainer of this.

22:02.760 --> 22:03.760
 Sure, of course.

22:03.760 --> 22:06.240
 There are a lot louder complainers out there.

22:06.240 --> 22:10.760
 I do observe that having a lot of data

22:10.760 --> 22:13.600
 does perpetuate their strength

22:13.600 --> 22:18.600
 and limits competition in many spaces.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.560
 But I also believe AI is much broader

22:21.560 --> 22:23.160
 than the internet space.

22:23.160 --> 22:26.520
 So the entrepreneurial opportunities still exists

22:26.520 --> 22:30.600
 in using AI to empower financial,

22:30.600 --> 22:34.600
 retail, manufacturing, education applications.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.440
 So I don't think it's quite a case

22:36.440 --> 22:38.920
 of full monopolistic dominance

22:38.920 --> 22:43.160
 that totally stifles innovation.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.600
 But I do believe in their areas of strength

22:45.600 --> 22:47.960
 it's hard to dislodge them.

22:48.960 --> 22:52.480
 I don't know if I have a good solution.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.960
 Probably the best solution is let

22:54.960 --> 22:58.320
 the entrepreneurial VC ecosystem work well

22:58.320 --> 23:02.160
 and find all the places that can create the next Google,

23:02.160 --> 23:03.520
 the next Facebook.

23:03.520 --> 23:07.880
 So there will always be increasing number of challengers.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.680
 In some sense that has happened a little bit.

23:10.680 --> 23:14.000
 You see Uber, Airbnb having emerged

23:14.000 --> 23:16.960
 despite the strength of the big three.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.760
 And I think China as an environment

23:21.760 --> 23:24.520
 may be more interesting for the emergence

23:24.520 --> 23:26.120
 because if you look at companies

23:26.120 --> 23:31.120
 between let's say 50 to $300 billion,

23:32.920 --> 23:35.720
 China has emerged more of such companies

23:35.720 --> 23:39.320
 than the US in the last three to four years

23:39.320 --> 23:41.560
 because of the larger marketplace,

23:41.560 --> 23:45.160
 because of the more fearless nature of the entrepreneurs.

23:46.440 --> 23:48.960
 And the Chinese giants are just as powerful

23:48.960 --> 23:50.240
 as American ones.

23:50.240 --> 23:52.360
 Tencent, Alibaba are very strong,

23:52.360 --> 23:56.480
 but ByteDance has emerged worth 75 billion

23:56.480 --> 23:59.600
 and financial while it's Alibaba affiliated,

23:59.600 --> 24:03.400
 it's nevertheless independent and worth 150 billion.

24:03.400 --> 24:07.800
 And so I do think if we start to extend

24:07.800 --> 24:09.440
 to traditional businesses,

24:09.440 --> 24:12.160
 we will see very valuable companies.

24:12.160 --> 24:17.160
 So it's probably not the case that in five or 10 years

24:17.600 --> 24:19.160
 we'll still see the whole world

24:19.160 --> 24:22.720
 with these five companies having such dominance.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.760
 So you've mentioned a couple of times

24:26.080 --> 24:29.240
 this fascinating world of entrepreneurship in China

24:29.240 --> 24:31.080
 of the fearless nature of the entrepreneur.

24:31.080 --> 24:33.240
 So can you maybe talk a little bit about

24:33.240 --> 24:35.520
 what it takes to be an entrepreneur in China?

24:35.520 --> 24:38.240
 What are the strategies that are undertaken?

24:38.240 --> 24:41.120
 What are the ways to achieve success?

24:41.120 --> 24:43.920
 What is the dynamic of VCF funding

24:43.920 --> 24:46.480
 of the way the government helps companies and so on?

24:46.480 --> 24:47.880
 What are the interesting aspects here

24:47.880 --> 24:50.200
 that are distinct from, that are different

24:50.200 --> 24:54.200
 from the Silicon Valley world of entrepreneurship?

24:55.240 --> 24:59.400
 Well, many of the listeners probably still

24:59.400 --> 25:03.000
 would brand Chinese entrepreneur as copycats.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.360
 And no doubt 10 years ago,

25:05.360 --> 25:09.080
 that would not be an inaccurate description.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.760
 Back 10 years ago,

25:10.760 --> 25:13.640
 an entrepreneur probably could not get funding

25:13.640 --> 25:16.000
 if he or she could not describe

25:16.000 --> 25:20.440
 what product he or she is copying from the US.

25:20.440 --> 25:23.360
 The first question is who has proven this business model

25:23.360 --> 25:27.200
 which is a nice way of asking who are you copying?

25:27.200 --> 25:29.560
 And that reason is understandable

25:29.560 --> 25:34.560
 because China had a much lower internet penetration

25:34.880 --> 25:39.880
 and didn't have enough indigenous experience

25:40.960 --> 25:43.240
 to build innovative products.

25:43.240 --> 25:47.640
 And secondly, internet was emerging.

25:47.640 --> 25:49.840
 Link startup was the way to do things,

25:49.840 --> 25:52.960
 building a first minimally viable product

25:52.960 --> 25:55.360
 and then expanding was the right way to go.

25:55.360 --> 25:59.520
 And the American successes have given a shortcut

25:59.520 --> 26:02.560
 that if you built your minimally viable product

26:02.560 --> 26:04.240
 based on an American product,

26:04.240 --> 26:06.720
 it's guaranteed to be a decent starting point.

26:06.720 --> 26:08.400
 Then you tweak it afterwards.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.280
 So as long as there are no IP infringement,

26:11.280 --> 26:14.000
 which as far as I know there hasn't been in the mobile

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
 and AI spaces, that's a much better shortcut.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.880
 And I think Silicon Valley would view that

26:21.880 --> 26:25.120
 as still not very honorable

26:25.120 --> 26:29.160
 because that's not your own idea to start with,

26:29.160 --> 26:32.560
 but you can't really at the same time

26:32.560 --> 26:35.120
 believe every idea must be your own

26:35.120 --> 26:38.080
 and believe in the link startup methodology

26:38.080 --> 26:41.840
 because link startup is intended to try many, many things

26:41.840 --> 26:44.160
 and then converge when that works.

26:44.160 --> 26:46.640
 And it's meant to be iterated and changed.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.640
 So finding a decent starting point

26:48.640 --> 26:51.160
 without legal violations,

26:51.160 --> 26:55.240
 there should be nothing morally dishonorable about that.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.920
 Yeah, so just a quick pause on that.

26:56.920 --> 26:58.600
 It's fascinating that that's,

26:59.760 --> 27:01.840
 why is that not honorable, right?

27:01.840 --> 27:04.600
 It's exactly as you formulated.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.600
 It seems like a perfect start for business.

27:07.600 --> 27:12.080
 Is to take, look at Amazon and say,

27:12.080 --> 27:14.480
 okay, we'll do exactly what Amazon is doing.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.760
 Let's start there in this particular market

27:16.760 --> 27:20.720
 and then let's out innovate them from that starting point.

27:20.720 --> 27:22.200
 Come up with new ways.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.760
 I mean, is it wrong to be,

27:25.200 --> 27:27.080
 except the word copycat just sounds bad,

27:27.080 --> 27:28.760
 but is it wrong to be a copycat?

27:28.760 --> 27:31.600
 It just seems like a smart strategy,

27:31.600 --> 27:35.760
 but yes, it doesn't have a heroic nature to it

27:35.760 --> 27:40.720
 that like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk,

27:40.720 --> 27:42.200
 sort of in something completely,

27:42.200 --> 27:43.880
 coming up with something completely new.

27:43.880 --> 27:45.280
 Yeah, I like the way you describe it.

27:45.280 --> 27:50.440
 It's a nonheroic, acceptable way to start the company

27:50.440 --> 27:52.800
 and maybe more expedient.

27:52.800 --> 27:57.800
 So that's, I think, a baggage for Silicon Valley

27:58.920 --> 28:00.760
 that if it doesn't let go,

28:00.760 --> 28:05.120
 then it may limit the ultimate ceiling of the company.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.200
 Take Snapchat as an example.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.840
 I think, you know, Evan's brilliant.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.520
 He built a great product,

28:11.520 --> 28:15.440
 but he's very proud that he wants to build his own features,

28:15.440 --> 28:16.800
 not copy others.

28:16.800 --> 28:20.960
 While Facebook was more willing to copy his features

28:20.960 --> 28:23.440
 and you see what happens in the competition.

28:23.440 --> 28:27.440
 So I think putting that handcuff on the company

28:27.440 --> 28:31.560
 would limit its ability to reach the maximum potential.

28:31.560 --> 28:33.840
 So back to the Chinese environment,

28:33.840 --> 28:38.400
 copying was merely a way to learn from the American masters.

28:38.400 --> 28:43.400
 Just like we, if we learned to play piano or painting,

28:43.440 --> 28:44.520
 you start by copying.

28:44.520 --> 28:45.960
 You don't start by innovating

28:45.960 --> 28:48.160
 when you don't have the basic skill sets.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.000
 So very amazingly, the Chinese entrepreneurs

28:51.000 --> 28:56.000
 about six years ago started to branch off

28:56.120 --> 28:59.480
 with these lean startups built on American ideas

28:59.480 --> 29:02.120
 to build better products than American products.

29:02.120 --> 29:04.960
 But they did start from the American idea.

29:04.960 --> 29:08.560
 And today WeChat is better than WhatsApp,

29:08.560 --> 29:10.520
 Weibo is better than Twitter,

29:10.520 --> 29:12.920
 Zhihu is better than Quora and so on.

29:12.920 --> 29:17.920
 So that I think is Chinese entrepreneurs going to step two.

29:18.520 --> 29:21.560
 And then step three is once these entrepreneurs

29:21.560 --> 29:23.720
 have done one or two of these companies,

29:23.720 --> 29:27.400
 they now look at the Chinese market and the opportunities

29:27.400 --> 29:30.600
 and come up with ideas that didn't exist elsewhere.

29:30.600 --> 29:34.200
 So products like Ant Financial,

29:34.200 --> 29:38.280
 under which includes Alipay, which is mobile payments,

29:38.280 --> 29:43.280
 and also the financial products for loans built on that.

29:44.320 --> 29:47.560
 And also in education, VIPKID,

29:48.560 --> 29:53.560
 and in social video, social network, TikTok,

29:54.880 --> 29:58.640
 and in social eCommerce, Pinduoduo,

29:58.640 --> 30:01.680
 and then in ride sharing, Mobike,

30:01.680 --> 30:05.600
 these are all Chinese innovated products

30:05.600 --> 30:08.680
 that now are being copied elsewhere.

30:08.680 --> 30:13.000
 So an additional interesting observation

30:13.000 --> 30:14.240
 is some of these products

30:14.240 --> 30:17.240
 are built on unique Chinese demographics,

30:17.240 --> 30:19.360
 which may not work in the US,

30:19.360 --> 30:23.120
 but may work very well in Southeast Asia, Africa,

30:23.120 --> 30:25.160
 and other developing worlds

30:25.160 --> 30:27.800
 that are a few years behind China.

30:27.800 --> 30:31.000
 And a few of these products maybe are universal

30:31.000 --> 30:33.720
 and are getting traction even in the United States,

30:33.720 --> 30:35.320
 such as TikTok.

30:35.320 --> 30:40.320
 So this whole ecosystem is supported by VCs

30:42.040 --> 30:43.480
 as a virtuous cycle,

30:43.480 --> 30:47.640
 because a large market with innovative entrepreneurs

30:47.640 --> 30:49.360
 will draw a lot of money

30:49.360 --> 30:51.520
 and then invest in these companies.

30:51.520 --> 30:54.480
 As the market gets larger and larger,

30:54.480 --> 30:58.440
 the China market is easily three, four times larger than the US,

30:58.440 --> 31:01.120
 they will create greater value and greater returns

31:01.120 --> 31:05.400
 for the VCs, thereby raising even more money.

31:05.400 --> 31:09.960
 So at Sinovation Ventures, our first fund was 15 million,

31:09.960 --> 31:12.000
 our last fund was 500 million.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.520
 So it reflects the valuation of the companies

31:16.520 --> 31:19.840
 and our us going multi stage and things like that.

31:19.840 --> 31:22.000
 It also has government support,

31:22.000 --> 31:25.360
 but not in the way most Americans would think of it.

31:25.360 --> 31:28.720
 The government actually leaves the entrepreneurial space

31:28.720 --> 31:32.400
 as a private enterprise, sort of self regulating,

31:32.400 --> 31:35.400
 and the government would build infrastructures

31:35.400 --> 31:38.520
 that would around it to make it work better.

31:38.520 --> 31:42.160
 For example, the Mass Entrepreneur Mass Innovation Plan

31:42.160 --> 31:44.120
 builds 8,000 incubators,

31:44.120 --> 31:47.560
 so the pipeline is very strong to the VCs.

31:47.560 --> 31:48.920
 For autonomous vehicles,

31:48.920 --> 31:52.600
 the Chinese government is building smart highways

31:52.600 --> 31:54.640
 with sensors, smart cities

31:54.640 --> 31:57.240
 that separate pedestrians from cars

31:57.240 --> 32:00.440
 that may allow initially an inferior

32:00.440 --> 32:03.640
 autonomous vehicle company to launch a car

32:03.640 --> 32:07.000
 without increasing with lower casualty

32:07.000 --> 32:10.880
 because the roads or the city is smart.

32:10.880 --> 32:13.160
 And the Chinese government at local levels

32:13.160 --> 32:16.720
 would have these guiding funds acting as LPs,

32:16.720 --> 32:18.800
 passive LPs to funds.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.400
 And when the fund makes money,

32:21.400 --> 32:23.880
 part of the money made is given back

32:23.880 --> 32:26.720
 to the GPs and potentially other LPs

32:26.720 --> 32:30.480
 to increase everybody's return

32:30.480 --> 32:33.080
 at the expense of the government's return.

32:33.080 --> 32:35.800
 So that's an interesting incentive

32:35.800 --> 32:40.800
 that entrusts the task of choosing entrepreneurs to VCs

32:41.080 --> 32:43.240
 who are better at it than the government

32:43.240 --> 32:46.080
 by letting some of the profits move that way.

32:46.080 --> 32:48.720
 So this is really fascinating, right?

32:48.720 --> 32:51.800
 So I look at the Russian government as a case study

32:51.800 --> 32:54.240
 where, let me put it this way,

32:54.240 --> 32:57.840
 there's no such government driven

32:57.840 --> 33:00.840
 large scale support of entrepreneurship.

33:00.840 --> 33:04.000
 And probably the same is true in the United States,

33:04.000 --> 33:07.640
 but the entrepreneurs themselves kind of find a way.

33:07.640 --> 33:11.640
 So maybe in a form of advice or explanation,

33:11.640 --> 33:15.560
 how did the Chinese government arrive to be this way

33:15.560 --> 33:17.720
 so supportive on entrepreneurship

33:17.720 --> 33:21.520
 to be in this particular way so forward thinking

33:21.520 --> 33:23.120
 at such a large scale?

33:23.120 --> 33:27.080
 And also perhaps, how can we copy it in other countries?

33:28.280 --> 33:29.800
 How can we encourage other governments,

33:29.800 --> 33:31.600
 like even the United States government,

33:31.600 --> 33:33.800
 to support infrastructure for autonomous vehicles

33:33.800 --> 33:36.040
 in that same kind of way, perhaps?

33:36.040 --> 33:41.040
 Yes, so these techniques are

33:41.040 --> 33:44.440
 the result of several key things,

33:44.440 --> 33:46.040
 some of which may be learnable,

33:46.040 --> 33:48.040
 some of which may be very hard.

33:48.040 --> 33:50.520
 One is just trial and error

33:50.520 --> 33:52.920
 and watching what everyone else is doing.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.680
 I think it's important to be humble

33:54.680 --> 33:56.920
 and not feel like you know all the answers.

33:56.920 --> 33:59.480
 The guiding funds idea came from Singapore,

33:59.480 --> 34:01.440
 which came from Israel.

34:01.440 --> 34:06.120
 And China made a few tweaks and turned it into a,

34:06.120 --> 34:09.320
 because the Chinese cities and government officials

34:09.320 --> 34:11.360
 kind of compete with each other

34:11.360 --> 34:14.680
 because they all want to make their city more successful

34:14.680 --> 34:19.680
 so they can get the next level in their political career.

34:20.280 --> 34:22.280
 And it's somewhat competitive.

34:22.280 --> 34:25.160
 So the central government made it a bit of a competition.

34:25.160 --> 34:26.800
 Everybody has a budget.

34:26.800 --> 34:29.840
 They can put it on AI or they can put it on bio

34:29.840 --> 34:32.160
 or they can put it on energy.

34:32.160 --> 34:34.120
 And then whoever gets the results,

34:34.120 --> 34:36.160
 the city shines, the people are better off,

34:36.160 --> 34:37.960
 the mayor gets a promotion.

34:37.960 --> 34:41.680
 So the tools is kind of almost like an entrepreneurial

34:41.680 --> 34:44.840
 environment for local governments

34:44.840 --> 34:47.480
 to see who can do a better job.

34:47.480 --> 34:52.480
 And also many of them try different experiments.

34:52.480 --> 34:57.480
 Some have given award to very smart researchers.

34:58.480 --> 35:00.840
 Just give them money and hope they'll start a company.

35:00.840 --> 35:05.840
 Some have given money to academic research labs,

35:05.840 --> 35:08.080
 maybe government research labs

35:08.080 --> 35:10.760
 to see if they can spin off some companies

35:10.760 --> 35:14.080
 from the science lab or something like that.

35:14.080 --> 35:17.120
 Some have tried to recruit overseas Chinese

35:17.120 --> 35:19.000
 to come back and start companies.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
 And they've had mixed results.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.400
 The one that worked the best was the guiding funds.

35:23.400 --> 35:25.880
 So it's almost like a lean startup idea

35:25.880 --> 35:27.560
 where people try different things

35:27.560 --> 35:30.600
 and what works sticks and everybody copies.

35:30.600 --> 35:32.880
 So now every city has a guiding fund.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.600
 So that's how that came about.

35:34.600 --> 35:39.600
 The autonomous vehicle and the massive spending

35:40.400 --> 35:45.400
 in highways and smart cities, that's a Chinese way.

35:46.080 --> 35:49.520
 It's about building infrastructure to facilitate.

35:49.520 --> 35:52.880
 It's a clear division of the government's responsibility

35:52.880 --> 35:55.400
 from the market.

35:55.400 --> 36:00.400
 The market should do everything in a private freeway,

36:00.560 --> 36:02.920
 but there are things the market can't afford to do

36:02.920 --> 36:04.480
 like infrastructure.

36:04.480 --> 36:08.680
 So the government always appropriates large amounts

36:08.680 --> 36:11.960
 of money for infrastructure building.

36:11.960 --> 36:16.840
 This happens with not only autonomous vehicle and AI,

36:16.840 --> 36:20.800
 but happened with the 3G and 4G.

36:20.800 --> 36:25.320
 You'll find that the Chinese wireless reception

36:25.320 --> 36:28.560
 is better than the US because massive spending

36:28.560 --> 36:30.600
 that tries to cover the whole country,

36:30.600 --> 36:33.040
 whereas in the US it may be a little spotty.

36:33.040 --> 36:36.880
 It's a government driven because I think they view

36:36.880 --> 36:41.880
 the coverage of cell access and 3G, 4G access

36:44.120 --> 36:47.080
 to be a governmental infrastructure spending

36:47.080 --> 36:49.880
 as opposed to capitalistic.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.240
 So that's, of course, the state owned enterprises

36:52.240 --> 36:54.280
 are also publicly traded,

36:54.280 --> 36:57.760
 but they also carry a government responsibility

36:57.760 --> 37:00.240
 to deliver infrastructure to all.

37:00.240 --> 37:01.920
 So it's a different way of thinking

37:01.920 --> 37:05.440
 that may be very hard to inject into Western countries

37:05.440 --> 37:09.320
 to say starting tomorrow, bandwidth infrastructure

37:09.320 --> 37:13.880
 and highways are gonna be governmental spending

37:13.880 --> 37:16.120
 with some characteristics.

37:16.120 --> 37:18.280
 What's your sense, and sorry to interrupt,

37:18.280 --> 37:20.480
 but because it's such a fascinating point,

37:21.680 --> 37:24.120
 do you think on the autonomous vehicle space

37:25.600 --> 37:30.160
 it's possible to solve the problem of full autonomy

37:30.160 --> 37:33.080
 without significant investment in infrastructure?

37:34.120 --> 37:36.440
 Well, that's really hard to speculate.

37:36.440 --> 37:39.000
 I think it's not a yes, no question,

37:39.000 --> 37:40.680
 but how long does it take question?

37:42.000 --> 37:45.200
 15 years, 30 years, 45 years.

37:45.200 --> 37:49.040
 Clearly with infrastructure augmentation,

37:49.040 --> 37:52.360
 whether it's road, the city or whole city planning,

37:52.360 --> 37:56.480
 building a new city, I'm sure that will accelerate

37:56.480 --> 37:58.320
 the day of the L5.

37:58.320 --> 38:01.280
 I'm not knowledgeable enough,

38:01.280 --> 38:03.920
 and it's hard to predict even when we're knowledgeable

38:03.920 --> 38:06.080
 because a lot of it is speculative.

38:07.160 --> 38:10.440
 But in the US, I don't think people would consider

38:10.440 --> 38:13.280
 building a new city the size of Chicago

38:13.280 --> 38:15.960
 to make it the AI slash autonomous city.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.880
 There are smaller ones being built, I'm aware of that.

38:18.880 --> 38:22.040
 But is infrastructure spend really impossible

38:22.040 --> 38:23.720
 for US or Western countries?

38:23.720 --> 38:25.760
 I don't think so.

38:25.760 --> 38:28.920
 The US highway system was built,

38:28.920 --> 38:31.960
 was that during President Eisenhower or Kennedy?

38:31.960 --> 38:33.160
 Eisenhower, yeah.

38:33.160 --> 38:37.240
 So maybe historians can study

38:37.240 --> 38:40.280
 how the President Eisenhower get the resources

38:40.280 --> 38:42.800
 to build this massive infrastructure

38:42.800 --> 38:47.560
 that surely gave US a tremendous amount of prosperity

38:47.560 --> 38:50.800
 over the next decade, if not century.

38:50.800 --> 38:53.080
 If I may comment on that then,

38:53.080 --> 38:55.440
 it takes us to artificial intelligence a little bit

38:55.440 --> 38:58.080
 because in order to build infrastructure,

38:58.080 --> 39:00.520
 it creates a lot of jobs.

39:00.520 --> 39:03.400
 So I'll be actually interested if you would say

39:03.400 --> 39:06.560
 that you talk in your book about all kinds of jobs

39:06.560 --> 39:08.920
 that could and could not be automated.

39:08.920 --> 39:13.080
 I wonder if building infrastructure is one of the jobs

39:13.080 --> 39:15.760
 that would not be easily automated.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.040
 Something you could think about

39:17.040 --> 39:19.920
 because I think you've mentioned somewhere in the talk

39:19.920 --> 39:24.280
 or that there might be, as jobs are being automated,

39:24.280 --> 39:26.200
 a role for government to create jobs

39:26.200 --> 39:28.160
 that can't be automated.

39:28.160 --> 39:31.040
 Yes, I think that's a possibility.

39:31.040 --> 39:34.280
 Back in the last financial crisis,

39:34.280 --> 39:37.840
 China put a lot of money

39:37.840 --> 39:41.200
 to basically give this economy a boost

39:41.200 --> 39:44.600
 and a lot of it went into infrastructure building.

39:45.480 --> 39:49.920
 And I think that's a legitimate way at the government level

39:49.920 --> 39:54.360
 to deal with the employment issues

39:54.360 --> 39:57.040
 as well as build out the infrastructure

39:57.040 --> 39:59.840
 as long as the infrastructures are truly needed

39:59.840 --> 40:02.160
 and as long as there is an employment problem,

40:02.160 --> 40:04.000
 which no, we don't know.

40:04.920 --> 40:07.840
 So maybe taking a little step back,

40:07.840 --> 40:12.840
 if you've been a leader and a researcher in AI

40:12.840 --> 40:16.200
 for several decades, at least 30 years,

40:16.200 --> 40:21.000
 so how has AI changed in the West and the East

40:21.000 --> 40:23.080
 as you've observed, as you've been deep in it

40:23.080 --> 40:25.080
 over the past 30 years?

40:25.080 --> 40:27.840
 Well, AI began as the pursuit

40:27.840 --> 40:30.280
 of understanding human intelligence

40:30.280 --> 40:34.160
 and the term itself represents that,

40:34.160 --> 40:37.520
 but it kind of drifted into the one sub area

40:37.520 --> 40:40.840
 that worked extremely well, which is machine intelligence.

40:40.840 --> 40:45.080
 And that's actually more using pattern recognition techniques

40:45.080 --> 40:50.080
 to basically do incredibly well on a limited domain,

40:51.280 --> 40:52.760
 large amount of data,

40:52.760 --> 40:57.120
 but relatively simple kinds of planning tasks

40:57.120 --> 40:58.680
 and not very creative.

40:58.680 --> 41:02.440
 So we didn't end up building human intelligence.

41:02.440 --> 41:04.560
 We built a different machine

41:04.560 --> 41:08.080
 that was a lot better than us, some problems,

41:08.080 --> 41:11.720
 but nowhere close to us on other problems.

41:11.720 --> 41:15.240
 So today, I think a lot of people still misunderstand

41:16.320 --> 41:18.040
 when we say artificial intelligence

41:18.040 --> 41:20.720
 and what various products can do,

41:20.720 --> 41:22.960
 people still think it's about replicating

41:22.960 --> 41:24.200
 human intelligence,

41:24.200 --> 41:27.600
 but the products out there really are closer

41:27.600 --> 41:31.680
 to having invented the internet or the spreadsheet

41:31.680 --> 41:34.440
 or the database and getting broader adoption.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.640
 And speaking further to the fears,

41:37.640 --> 41:40.360
 near term fears that people have about AI,

41:40.360 --> 41:45.080
 so you're commenting on the sort of general intelligence

41:45.080 --> 41:48.080
 that people in the popular culture from sci fi movies

41:48.080 --> 41:49.600
 have a sense about AI,

41:49.600 --> 41:52.000
 but there's practical fears about AI,

41:52.000 --> 41:54.840
 the narrow AI that you're talking about

41:54.840 --> 41:57.280
 of automating particular kinds of jobs

41:57.280 --> 41:59.440
 and you talk about them in the book.

41:59.440 --> 42:01.560
 So what are the kinds of jobs in your view

42:01.560 --> 42:04.480
 that you see in the next five, 10 years

42:04.480 --> 42:09.280
 beginning to be automated by AI systems algorithms?

42:09.280 --> 42:13.040
 Yes, this is also maybe a little bit counterintuitive

42:13.040 --> 42:15.280
 because it's the routine jobs

42:15.280 --> 42:18.360
 that will be displaced the soonest

42:18.360 --> 42:20.880
 and they may not be displaced entirely,

42:20.880 --> 42:24.080
 maybe 50%, 80% of a job,

42:24.080 --> 42:26.320
 but when the workload drops by that much,

42:26.320 --> 42:28.760
 employment will come down.

42:28.760 --> 42:31.520
 And also another part of misunderstanding

42:31.520 --> 42:35.720
 is most people think of AI replacing routine jobs

42:35.720 --> 42:38.760
 than they think of the assembly line, the workers.

42:38.760 --> 42:41.000
 Well, that will have some effect,

42:41.000 --> 42:44.240
 but it's actually the routine white collar workers

42:44.240 --> 42:46.200
 that's easiest to replace

42:46.200 --> 42:49.280
 because to replace a white collar worker,

42:49.280 --> 42:50.720
 you just need software.

42:50.720 --> 42:53.120
 To replace a blue collar worker,

42:53.120 --> 42:57.200
 you need robotics, mechanical excellence,

42:57.200 --> 43:01.880
 and the ability to deal with dexterity

43:01.880 --> 43:05.640
 and maybe even unknown environments, very, very difficult.

43:05.640 --> 43:10.600
 So if we were to categorize the most dangerous

43:10.600 --> 43:12.400
 white collar jobs,

43:12.400 --> 43:15.640
 they would be things like back office,

43:15.640 --> 43:17.920
 people who copy and paste

43:17.920 --> 43:22.200
 and deal with simple computer programs and data

43:22.200 --> 43:25.600
 and maybe paper and OCR,

43:25.600 --> 43:29.040
 and they don't make strategic decisions.

43:29.040 --> 43:32.040
 They basically facilitate the process.

43:32.040 --> 43:34.600
 These softwares and paper systems don't work.

43:34.600 --> 43:39.400
 So you have people dealing with new employee orientation,

43:40.520 --> 43:44.320
 searching for past lawsuits and financial documents,

43:45.200 --> 43:47.920
 and doing reference check.

43:47.920 --> 43:50.960
 So basic searching and management of data.

43:50.960 --> 43:52.800
 That's the most endangered being lost.

43:52.800 --> 43:56.440
 In addition to the white collar repetitive work,

43:56.440 --> 44:00.240
 a lot of simple interaction work can also be taken care of

44:00.240 --> 44:04.840
 such as telesales, telemarketing, customer service,

44:04.840 --> 44:07.280
 as well as many physical jobs

44:07.280 --> 44:09.520
 that are in the same location

44:09.520 --> 44:12.200
 and don't require a high degree of dexterity.

44:12.200 --> 44:17.200
 So fruit picking, dishwashing, assembly line inspection

44:17.840 --> 44:20.320
 are jobs in that category.

44:20.320 --> 44:24.440
 So altogether, back office is a big part.

44:25.400 --> 44:29.840
 And the blue collar may be smaller initially,

44:29.840 --> 44:32.520
 but over time, AI will get better.

44:32.520 --> 44:36.880
 And when we start to get to over the next 15, 20 years,

44:36.880 --> 44:39.120
 the ability to actually have the dexterity

44:39.120 --> 44:42.600
 of doing assembly line, that's a huge chunk of jobs.

44:42.600 --> 44:45.600
 And when autonomous vehicles start to work,

44:45.600 --> 44:47.440
 initially starting with truck drivers,

44:47.440 --> 44:49.360
 but eventually to all drivers,

44:49.360 --> 44:52.000
 that's another huge group of workers.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.600
 So I see modest numbers in the next five years,

44:55.600 --> 44:58.080
 but increasing rapidly after that.

44:58.080 --> 45:01.240
 On the worry of the jobs that are in danger

45:01.240 --> 45:03.080
 and the gradual loss of jobs,

45:04.080 --> 45:06.680
 I'm not sure if you're familiar with Andrew Yang.

45:06.680 --> 45:07.840
 Yes, I am.

45:07.840 --> 45:10.600
 So there's a candidate for president of the United States

45:10.600 --> 45:14.400
 whose platform Andrew Yang is based around,

45:14.400 --> 45:17.720
 in part around job loss due to automation.

45:17.720 --> 45:19.600
 And also in addition,

45:19.600 --> 45:22.600
 the need perhaps of universal basic income

45:22.600 --> 45:25.280
 to support jobs that are,

45:25.280 --> 45:28.600
 folks who lose their job due to automation and so on.

45:28.600 --> 45:30.400
 And in general, support people

45:30.400 --> 45:34.360
 under complex, unstable job market.

45:34.360 --> 45:36.760
 So what are your thoughts about his concerns,

45:36.760 --> 45:39.160
 him as a candidate, his ideas in general?

45:40.080 --> 45:43.440
 I think his thinking is generally in the right direction,

45:44.680 --> 45:48.480
 but his approach as a presidential candidate

45:48.480 --> 45:51.040
 may be a little bit ahead of the time.

45:51.040 --> 45:55.200
 And I think the displacements will happen,

45:56.120 --> 45:57.800
 but will they happen soon enough

45:57.800 --> 46:00.480
 for people to agree to vote for him?

46:00.480 --> 46:03.800
 The unemployment numbers are not very high yet.

46:03.800 --> 46:07.600
 And I think he and I have the same challenge.

46:07.600 --> 46:11.560
 If I want to theoretically convince people this is an issue

46:11.560 --> 46:13.920
 and he wants to become the president,

46:13.920 --> 46:17.520
 people have to see how can this be the case

46:17.520 --> 46:19.720
 when unemployment numbers are low.

46:19.720 --> 46:21.400
 So that is the challenge.

46:21.400 --> 46:26.400
 And I think I do agree with him on the displacement issue,

46:27.080 --> 46:29.080
 on universal basic income.

46:30.280 --> 46:33.920
 At a very vanilla level, I don't agree with it

46:33.920 --> 46:38.360
 because I think the main issue is retraining.

46:38.360 --> 46:41.520
 So people need to be incented

46:41.520 --> 46:45.480
 not by just giving a monthly $2,000 check or $1,000 check

46:45.480 --> 46:47.160
 and do whatever they want

46:47.160 --> 46:50.960
 because they don't have the know how

46:50.960 --> 46:55.960
 to know what to retrain to go into what type of a job.

46:56.840 --> 46:58.640
 And guidance is needed.

46:58.640 --> 47:00.440
 And retraining is needed

47:00.440 --> 47:03.160
 because historically when technology revolutions,

47:03.160 --> 47:06.880
 when routine jobs were displaced, new routine jobs came up.

47:06.880 --> 47:09.400
 So there was always room for that.

47:09.400 --> 47:11.840
 But with AI and automation,

47:11.840 --> 47:15.320
 the whole point is replacing all routine jobs eventually.

47:15.320 --> 47:17.840
 So there will be fewer and fewer routine jobs.

47:17.840 --> 47:22.640
 And AI will create jobs, but it won't create routine jobs

47:22.640 --> 47:24.840
 because if it creates routine jobs,

47:24.840 --> 47:26.880
 why wouldn't AI just do it?

47:26.880 --> 47:30.360
 So therefore the people who are losing the jobs

47:30.360 --> 47:32.280
 are losing routine jobs.

47:32.280 --> 47:35.680
 The jobs that are becoming available are non routine jobs.

47:35.680 --> 47:39.280
 So the social stipend needs to be put in place

47:39.280 --> 47:42.040
 is for the routine workers who lost their jobs

47:42.040 --> 47:46.120
 to be retrained maybe in six months, maybe in three years,

47:46.120 --> 47:48.560
 takes a while to retrain on the non routine job

47:48.560 --> 47:51.360
 and then take on a job that will last

47:51.360 --> 47:53.360
 for that person's lifetime.

47:53.360 --> 47:55.280
 Now, having said that,

47:55.280 --> 47:57.120
 if you look deeply into Andrew's document,

47:57.120 --> 47:58.200
 he does cater for that.

47:58.200 --> 48:03.200
 So I'm not disagreeing with what he's trying to do.

48:03.280 --> 48:06.320
 But for simplification, sometimes he just says UBI,

48:06.320 --> 48:08.720
 but simple UBI wouldn't work.

48:08.720 --> 48:10.560
 And I think you've mentioned elsewhere

48:10.560 --> 48:15.560
 that the goal isn't necessarily to give people enough money

48:15.720 --> 48:19.080
 to survive or live, or even to prosper.

48:19.080 --> 48:22.760
 The point is to give them a job that gives them meaning.

48:22.760 --> 48:24.560
 That meaning is extremely important.

48:25.560 --> 48:28.560
 That our employment, at least in the United States

48:28.560 --> 48:31.120
 and perhaps it carries across the world,

48:31.120 --> 48:34.520
 provides something that's, forgive me for saying,

48:34.520 --> 48:35.600
 greater than money.

48:35.600 --> 48:36.880
 It provides meaning.

48:36.880 --> 48:41.880
 So now, what kind of jobs do you think can't be automated?

48:43.280 --> 48:45.080
 Can you talk a little bit about creativity

48:45.080 --> 48:46.640
 and compassion in your book?

48:46.640 --> 48:49.640
 What aspects do you think it's difficult to automate

48:49.640 --> 48:50.800
 for an AI system?

48:51.920 --> 48:56.440
 Because an AI system is currently merely optimizing.

48:56.440 --> 48:59.240
 It's not able to reason, plan,

48:59.240 --> 49:02.040
 or think creatively or strategically.

49:02.040 --> 49:04.400
 It's not able to deal with complex problems.

49:04.400 --> 49:08.800
 It can't come up with a new problem and solve it.

49:08.800 --> 49:11.480
 A human needs to find the problem

49:11.480 --> 49:14.760
 and pose it as an optimization problem,

49:14.760 --> 49:16.640
 then have the AI work at it.

49:16.640 --> 49:21.640
 So an AI would have a very hard time discovering a new drug

49:22.360 --> 49:25.400
 or discovering a new style of painting

49:26.440 --> 49:31.440
 or dealing with complex tasks such as managing a company

49:31.440 --> 49:34.440
 that isn't just about optimizing the bottom line,

49:34.440 --> 49:38.000
 but also about employee satisfaction, corporate brand,

49:38.000 --> 49:39.840
 and many, many other things.

49:39.840 --> 49:43.400
 So that is one category of things.

49:43.400 --> 49:47.360
 And because these things are challenging, creative, complex,

49:47.360 --> 49:51.160
 doing them creates a high degree of satisfaction

49:51.160 --> 49:54.480
 and therefore appealing to our desire for working,

49:54.480 --> 49:57.360
 which isn't just to make the money, make the ends meet,

49:57.360 --> 49:59.560
 but also that we've accomplished something

49:59.560 --> 50:02.320
 that others maybe can't do or can't do as well.

50:03.320 --> 50:06.320
 Another type of job that is much numerous

50:06.320 --> 50:10.240
 would be compassionate jobs, jobs that require compassion,

50:10.240 --> 50:13.600
 empathy, human touch, human trust.

50:13.600 --> 50:17.760
 AI can't do that because AI is cold, calculating,

50:17.760 --> 50:21.920
 and even if it can fake that to some extent,

50:21.920 --> 50:25.120
 it will make errors and that will make it look very silly.

50:25.120 --> 50:28.320
 And also, I think even if AI did okay,

50:28.320 --> 50:32.000
 people would want to interact with another person,

50:32.000 --> 50:35.920
 whether it's for some kind of a service or a teacher

50:35.920 --> 50:40.920
 or a doctor or a concierge or a masseuse or a bartender.

50:40.920 --> 50:44.440
 There are so many jobs where people just don't want

50:44.440 --> 50:48.000
 to interact with a cold robot or software.

50:49.400 --> 50:52.480
 I've had an entrepreneur who built an elderly care robot

50:52.480 --> 50:55.240
 and they found that the elderly really only use it

50:55.240 --> 50:56.880
 for customer service.

50:56.880 --> 50:59.480
 And not, but not to service the product,

50:59.480 --> 51:01.840
 but they click on customer service

51:01.840 --> 51:04.120
 and the video of a person comes up

51:04.120 --> 51:05.960
 and then the person says,

51:05.960 --> 51:08.080
 how come my daughter didn't call me?

51:08.080 --> 51:10.240
 Let me show you a picture of her grandkids.

51:10.240 --> 51:14.000
 So people yearn for that people, people interaction.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.840
 So even if robots improved, people just don't want it.

51:17.840 --> 51:20.120
 And those jobs are going to be increasing

51:20.120 --> 51:22.840
 because AI will create a lot of value,

51:22.840 --> 51:26.640
 $16 trillion to the world in the next 10 years.

51:26.640 --> 51:29.520
 Next 11 years, according to PWC.

51:29.520 --> 51:34.520
 And that will give people money to enjoy services,

51:34.640 --> 51:39.640
 whether it's eating a gourmet meal or tourism and traveling

51:39.680 --> 51:41.480
 or having concierge services,

51:41.480 --> 51:45.600
 the services revolving around every dollar

51:45.600 --> 51:48.080
 of that $16 trillion will be tremendous.

51:48.080 --> 51:50.080
 It will create more opportunities

51:50.080 --> 51:52.800
 that are to service the people who did well

51:52.800 --> 51:56.240
 through AI with things.

51:56.240 --> 51:58.280
 But even at the same time,

51:58.280 --> 52:01.720
 the entire society is very much short

52:01.720 --> 52:04.240
 in need of many service oriented,

52:04.240 --> 52:06.200
 compassionate oriented jobs.

52:06.200 --> 52:10.360
 The best example is probably in healthcare services.

52:10.360 --> 52:14.320
 There's going to be 2 million new jobs,

52:14.320 --> 52:15.400
 not counting replacement,

52:15.400 --> 52:17.520
 just brand new incremental jobs

52:17.520 --> 52:20.560
 in the next six years in healthcare services.

52:20.560 --> 52:25.000
 That includes nurses, orderly in the hospital,

52:25.000 --> 52:30.000
 elderly care and also at home care is particularly lacking.

52:31.480 --> 52:34.840
 And those jobs are not likely to be filled.

52:34.840 --> 52:36.840
 So there's likely to be a shortage.

52:36.840 --> 52:38.600
 And the reason they're not filled

52:38.600 --> 52:41.600
 is simply because they don't pay very well

52:41.600 --> 52:46.600
 and that the social status of these jobs are not very good.

52:47.520 --> 52:49.720
 So they pay about half as much

52:49.720 --> 52:52.160
 as a heavy equipment operator,

52:52.160 --> 52:55.600
 which will be replaced a lot sooner.

52:55.600 --> 52:57.560
 And they pay probably comparably

52:57.560 --> 52:59.880
 to someone on the assembly line.

52:59.880 --> 53:03.480
 And so if we ignoring all the other issues

53:03.480 --> 53:07.160
 and just think about satisfaction from one's job,

53:07.160 --> 53:10.520
 someone repetitively doing the same manual action

53:10.520 --> 53:11.640
 at an assembly line,

53:11.640 --> 53:14.640
 that can't create a lot of job satisfaction,

53:14.640 --> 53:17.680
 but someone taking care of a sick person

53:17.680 --> 53:19.600
 and getting a hug and thank you

53:19.600 --> 53:22.000
 from that person and the family,

53:22.000 --> 53:24.680
 I think is quite satisfying.

53:24.680 --> 53:28.720
 So if only we could fix the pay for service jobs,

53:28.720 --> 53:31.880
 there are plenty of jobs that require some training

53:31.880 --> 53:33.400
 or a lot of training

53:33.400 --> 53:36.960
 for the people coming off the routine jobs to take.

53:36.960 --> 53:40.320
 We can easily imagine someone

53:40.320 --> 53:43.480
 who was maybe a cashier at the grocery store

53:43.480 --> 53:45.640
 as stores become automated,

53:45.640 --> 53:49.160
 learns to become a nurse or an at home care.

53:49.160 --> 53:52.760
 I also do want to point out the blue collar jobs

53:52.760 --> 53:54.720
 are going to stay around a bit longer.

53:54.720 --> 53:56.440
 Some of them quite a bit longer.

53:58.120 --> 54:02.200
 AI cannot be told go clean an arbitrary home.

54:02.200 --> 54:03.920
 That's incredibly hard.

54:03.920 --> 54:07.560
 Arguably it's an L5 level of difficulty, right?

54:07.560 --> 54:10.080
 And then AI cannot be a good plumber

54:10.080 --> 54:12.840
 because plumber is almost like a mini detective

54:12.840 --> 54:15.640
 that has to figure out where the leak came from.

54:15.640 --> 54:20.200
 So yet AI probably can be an assembly line

54:20.200 --> 54:22.800
 and auto mechanic and so on.

54:22.800 --> 54:26.760
 So one has to study which blue collar jobs are going away

54:26.760 --> 54:29.240
 and facilitate retraining for the people

54:29.240 --> 54:31.120
 to go into the ones that won't go away

54:31.120 --> 54:32.960
 or maybe even will increase.

54:32.960 --> 54:35.000
 I mean, it is fascinating that it's easier

54:35.000 --> 54:39.480
 to build a world champion chess player

54:39.480 --> 54:42.040
 than it is to build a mediocre plumber.

54:42.040 --> 54:43.160
 Yes, right.

54:43.160 --> 54:44.000
 Very true.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.160
 And to AI and that goes counterintuitive

54:46.160 --> 54:48.000
 to a lot of people's understanding

54:48.000 --> 54:50.120
 of what artificial intelligence is.

54:50.120 --> 54:52.480
 So it sounds, I mean, you're painting

54:52.480 --> 54:55.400
 a pretty optimistic picture about retraining

54:55.400 --> 54:57.000
 about the number of jobs

54:57.000 --> 54:59.560
 and actually the meaningful nature of those jobs

54:59.560 --> 55:02.080
 once we automate the repetitive tasks.

55:02.080 --> 55:07.080
 So overall, are you optimistic about the future

55:08.160 --> 55:11.640
 where much of the repetitive tasks are automated?

55:11.640 --> 55:13.840
 That there is a lot of room for humans

55:13.840 --> 55:17.360
 for the compassionate, for the creative input

55:17.360 --> 55:20.080
 that only humans can provide?

55:20.080 --> 55:23.400
 I am optimistic if we start to take action.

55:23.400 --> 55:27.640
 If we have no action in the next five years,

55:27.640 --> 55:30.760
 I think it's going to be hard to deal

55:30.760 --> 55:34.200
 with the devastating losses that will emerge.

55:34.200 --> 55:37.120
 So if we start thinking about retraining,

55:37.120 --> 55:39.360
 maybe with the low hanging fruits,

55:39.360 --> 55:41.800
 explaining to vocational schools

55:41.800 --> 55:45.760
 why they should train more plumbers than auto mechanics,

55:46.640 --> 55:49.680
 maybe starting with some government subsidy

55:49.680 --> 55:53.600
 for corporations to have more training positions.

55:53.600 --> 55:58.160
 We start to explain to people why retraining is important.

55:58.160 --> 56:00.760
 We start to think about what the future of education,

56:00.760 --> 56:04.560
 how that needs to be tweaked for the era of AI.

56:04.560 --> 56:06.760
 If we start to make incremental progress

56:06.760 --> 56:08.960
 and the greater number of people understand,

56:08.960 --> 56:12.360
 then there's no reason to think we can't deal with this

56:12.360 --> 56:14.360
 because this technological revolution

56:14.360 --> 56:17.280
 is arguably similar to what electricity,

56:17.280 --> 56:20.440
 industrial revolutions, and internet brought about.

56:20.440 --> 56:22.680
 Do you think there's a role for policy,

56:22.680 --> 56:24.640
 for governments to step in,

56:24.640 --> 56:28.000
 to help with policy to create a better world?

56:28.000 --> 56:32.280
 Absolutely, and the governments don't have to believe

56:32.280 --> 56:34.040
 an employment will go up,

56:34.040 --> 56:37.560
 and they don't have to believe automation will be this fast

56:37.560 --> 56:39.440
 to do something.

56:39.440 --> 56:42.520
 Revamping vocational school would be one example.

56:42.520 --> 56:44.760
 Another is if there's a big gap

56:44.760 --> 56:47.480
 in healthcare service employment,

56:47.480 --> 56:51.840
 and we know that a country's population is growing older,

56:51.840 --> 56:54.280
 more longevity, living older,

56:54.280 --> 56:57.560
 because people over 80 require five times as much care

56:57.560 --> 56:59.680
 as those under 80,

56:59.680 --> 57:03.480
 then it is a good time to incent training programs

57:03.480 --> 57:07.600
 for elderly care to find ways to improve the pay.

57:07.600 --> 57:11.720
 Maybe one way would be to offer as part of Medicare

57:11.720 --> 57:14.600
 or the equivalent program for people over 80

57:14.600 --> 57:18.760
 to be entitled to a few hours of elderly care at home,

57:18.760 --> 57:22.160
 and then that might be reimbursable,

57:22.160 --> 57:26.720
 and that will stimulate the service industry

57:26.720 --> 57:28.920
 around the policy.

57:28.920 --> 57:33.400
 Do you have concerns about large entities,

57:33.400 --> 57:35.480
 whether it's governments or companies,

57:35.480 --> 57:39.240
 controlling the future of AI development in general?

57:39.240 --> 57:41.000
 So we talked about companies.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.360
 Do you have a better sense that governments

57:44.360 --> 57:49.360
 can better represent the interests of the people

57:49.480 --> 57:52.320
 than companies, or do you believe companies

57:52.320 --> 57:54.960
 are better at representing the interests of the people?

57:54.960 --> 57:56.840
 Or is there no easy answer?

57:56.840 --> 57:58.120
 I don't think there's an easy answer

57:58.120 --> 58:00.200
 because it's a double edged sword.

58:00.200 --> 58:03.760
 The companies and governments can provide better services

58:03.760 --> 58:06.760
 with more access to data and more access to AI,

58:06.760 --> 58:09.440
 but that also leads to greater power,

58:09.440 --> 58:13.600
 which can lead to uncontrollable problems,

58:13.600 --> 58:17.760
 whether it's monopoly or corruption in the government.

58:17.760 --> 58:21.400
 So I think one has to be careful

58:21.400 --> 58:25.040
 to look at how much data that companies and governments have

58:25.040 --> 58:30.040
 and some kind of checks and balances would be helpful.

58:30.400 --> 58:34.040
 So again, I come from Russia.

58:34.040 --> 58:35.960
 There's something called the Cold War.

58:36.840 --> 58:39.240
 So let me ask a difficult question here

58:39.240 --> 58:40.720
 looking at conflict.

58:40.720 --> 58:42.160
 Steven Pinker written a great book

58:42.160 --> 58:45.440
 that conflict all over the world is decreasing in general.

58:45.440 --> 58:49.680
 But do you have a sense that having written

58:49.680 --> 58:51.800
 the book AI Superpowers,

58:51.800 --> 58:54.440
 do you see a major international conflict

58:54.440 --> 58:57.840
 potentially arising between major nations,

58:57.840 --> 59:00.400
 whatever they are, whether it's Russia, China,

59:00.400 --> 59:04.120
 European nations, United States or others

59:04.120 --> 59:07.720
 in the next 10, 20, 50 years around AI,

59:07.720 --> 59:10.200
 around the digital space, cyberspace?

59:10.200 --> 59:12.120
 Do you worry about that?

59:12.120 --> 59:15.520
 Is that something we need to think about

59:15.520 --> 59:18.640
 and try to alleviate or prevent?

59:19.600 --> 59:22.680
 I believe in greater engagement.

59:22.680 --> 59:26.720
 A lot of the worries about more powerful AI

59:26.720 --> 59:31.720
 are based on a arms race metaphor.

59:33.280 --> 59:38.280
 And when you extrapolate into military kinds of scenarios,

59:41.560 --> 59:46.560
 AI can automate and autonomous weapons

59:46.560 --> 59:48.800
 that needs to be controlled somehow

59:48.800 --> 59:51.640
 and autonomous decision making

59:51.640 --> 59:56.640
 can lead to not enough time to fix international crises.

59:57.560 --> 1:00:00.880
 So I actually believe a Cold War mentality

1:00:00.880 --> 1:00:02.480
 would be very dangerous

1:00:02.480 --> 1:00:05.560
 because should two countries rely on AI

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:07.400
 to make certain decisions

1:00:07.400 --> 1:00:10.040
 and they don't even talk to each other,

1:00:10.040 --> 1:00:12.120
 they do their own scenario planning,

1:00:12.120 --> 1:00:15.120
 then something could easily go wrong.

1:00:15.120 --> 1:00:18.960
 I think engagement, interaction, some protocols

1:00:18.960 --> 1:00:23.960
 to avoid inadvertent disasters is actually needed.

1:00:25.120 --> 1:00:29.120
 So it's natural for each country to want to be the best,

1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:34.120
 whether it's in nuclear technologies or AI or bio.

1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:37.720
 But I think it's important to realize

1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:41.360
 if each country has a black box AI

1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:43.280
 and don't talk to each other,

1:00:43.280 --> 1:00:49.280
 that probably presents greater challenges to humanity

1:00:49.280 --> 1:00:51.480
 than if they interacted.

1:00:51.480 --> 1:00:53.760
 I think there can still be competition,

1:00:53.760 --> 1:00:57.080
 but with some degree of protocol for interaction,

1:00:57.080 --> 1:01:02.080
 just like when there was a nuclear competition,

1:01:02.160 --> 1:01:04.880
 there were some protocol for deterrence

1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:08.000
 among US, Russia, and China.

1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.880
 And I think that engagement is needed.

1:01:10.880 --> 1:01:13.520
 So of course, we're still far from AI

1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:16.000
 presenting that kind of danger.

1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.400
 But what I worry the most about

1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:23.000
 is the level of engagement seems to be coming down.

1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.360
 The level of distrust seems to be going up,

1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:30.240
 especially from the US towards other large countries

1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:33.400
 such as China and of course, and Russia, yes.

1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:34.680
 Is there a way to make that better?

1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:37.240
 So let's beautifully put level of engagement

1:01:37.240 --> 1:01:40.680
 and even just basic trust and communication

1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:45.680
 as opposed to sort of making artificial enemies

1:01:48.880 --> 1:01:52.520
 out of particular countries.

1:01:53.360 --> 1:01:57.160
 Do you have a sense how we can make it better?

1:01:57.160 --> 1:02:01.720
 Actionable items that as a society we can take on?

1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:05.000
 I'm not an expert at geopolitics,

1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:10.800
 but I would say that we look pretty foolish as humankind

1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:13.200
 when we are faced with the opportunity

1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:19.520
 to create $16 trillion for humanity,

1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:26.040
 and yet we're not solving fundamental problems

1:02:26.040 --> 1:02:29.520
 with parts of the world still in poverty.

1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:31.320
 And for the first time,

1:02:31.320 --> 1:02:34.600
 we have the resources to overcome poverty and hunger.

1:02:34.600 --> 1:02:35.960
 We're not using it on that,

1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:38.800
 but we're fueling competition among superpowers.

1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:41.880
 And that's a very unfortunate thing.

1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:44.760
 If we become utopian for a moment,

1:02:44.760 --> 1:02:52.240
 imagine a benevolent world government

1:02:52.240 --> 1:02:56.120
 that has this $16 trillion and maybe some AI

1:02:56.120 --> 1:02:59.280
 to figure out how to use it to deal with diseases

1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:02.640
 and problems and hate and things like that.

1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:04.840
 World would be a lot better off.

1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:07.600
 So what is wrong with the current world?

1:03:07.600 --> 1:03:11.040
 I think the people with more skill than I

1:03:11.040 --> 1:03:13.920
 should think about this.

1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:16.920
 And then the geopolitics issue with superpower competition

1:03:16.920 --> 1:03:19.360
 is one side of the issue.

1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:24.040
 There's another side which I worry maybe even more,

1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:29.360
 which is as the $16 trillion all gets made by US and China

1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:32.040
 and a few of the other developed countries,

1:03:32.040 --> 1:03:34.280
 the poorer country will get nothing

1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:36.880
 because they don't have technology

1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:42.440
 and the wealth disparity and inequality will increase.

1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:45.880
 So a poorer country with a large population

1:03:45.880 --> 1:03:48.520
 will not only benefit from the AI boom

1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:50.360
 or other technology booms,

1:03:50.360 --> 1:03:52.360
 but they will have their workers

1:03:52.360 --> 1:03:56.040
 who previously had hoped they could do the China model

1:03:56.040 --> 1:03:58.840
 and do outsource manufacturing or the India model

1:03:58.840 --> 1:04:02.640
 so they could do the outsource process or call center.

1:04:02.640 --> 1:04:05.800
 Well, all those jobs are gonna be gone in 10 or 15 years.

1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:10.800
 So the individual citizen may be a net liability,

1:04:12.080 --> 1:04:15.040
 I mean, financially speaking to a poorer country

1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:19.800
 and not an asset to claw itself out of poverty.

1:04:19.800 --> 1:04:22.640
 So in that kind of situation,

1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:26.400
 these large countries with not much tech

1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:30.080
 are going to be facing a downward spiral

1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:33.120
 and it's unclear what could be done.

1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:34.720
 And then when we look back

1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:37.600
 and say there's $16 trillion being created

1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:39.720
 and it's all being kept by US, China

1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:43.360
 and other developed countries, it just doesn't feel right.

1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:46.920
 So I hope people who know about geopolitics

1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:49.960
 can find solutions that's beyond my expertise.

1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:53.160
 So different countries that we've talked about

1:04:53.160 --> 1:04:55.200
 have different value systems.

1:04:55.200 --> 1:04:56.920
 If you look at the United States,

1:04:56.920 --> 1:04:58.960
 to an almost extreme degree,

1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:03.400
 there is an absolute desire for freedom of speech.

1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:05.160
 If you look at a country where I was raised,

1:05:05.160 --> 1:05:06.960
 that desire just amongst the people

1:05:06.960 --> 1:05:11.960
 is not as elevated as it is to basically fundamental level

1:05:15.040 --> 1:05:17.560
 to the essence of what it means to be America, right?

1:05:17.560 --> 1:05:19.160
 And the same is true with China,

1:05:19.160 --> 1:05:21.480
 there's different value systems.

1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:26.480
 There's some censorship of internet content

1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:31.280
 that China and Russia and many other countries undertake.

1:05:31.280 --> 1:05:36.280
 Do you see that having effects on innovation,

1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:38.880
 other aspects of some of the tech stuff,

1:05:38.880 --> 1:05:40.920
 AI development we talked about,

1:05:40.920 --> 1:05:42.520
 and maybe from another angle,

1:05:42.520 --> 1:05:46.200
 do you see that changing in different ways

1:05:46.200 --> 1:05:49.560
 over the next 10 years, 20 years, 50 years

1:05:49.560 --> 1:05:53.000
 as China continues to grow as it does now

1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:54.840
 in its tech innovation?

1:05:55.720 --> 1:05:57.200
 There's a common belief

1:05:57.200 --> 1:06:01.040
 that full freedom of speech and expression

1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:03.040
 is correlated with creativity,

1:06:03.040 --> 1:06:08.040
 which is correlated with entrepreneurial success.

1:06:08.520 --> 1:06:13.200
 I think empirically we have seen that is not true

1:06:13.200 --> 1:06:15.600
 and China has been successful.

1:06:15.600 --> 1:06:19.600
 That's not to say the fundamental values are not right

1:06:19.600 --> 1:06:20.840
 or not the best,

1:06:20.840 --> 1:06:25.040
 but it's just that perfect correlation isn't there.

1:06:25.880 --> 1:06:30.560
 It's hard to read the tea leaves on opening up or not

1:06:30.560 --> 1:06:31.720
 in any country,

1:06:31.720 --> 1:06:35.880
 and I've not been very good at that in my past predictions,

1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:40.840
 but I do believe every country

1:06:40.840 --> 1:06:45.840
 shares a lot of fundamental values for the longterm.

1:06:47.440 --> 1:06:52.440
 So China is drafting its privacy policy

1:06:54.480 --> 1:06:57.240
 for individual citizens,

1:06:57.240 --> 1:07:00.000
 and they don't look that different

1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:03.240
 from the American or European ones.

1:07:03.240 --> 1:07:07.600
 So people do want to protect their privacy

1:07:07.600 --> 1:07:10.680
 and have the opportunity to express

1:07:10.680 --> 1:07:14.200
 and I think the fundamental values are there.

1:07:14.200 --> 1:07:17.920
 The question is in the execution and timing,

1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:21.760
 how soon or when will that start to open up?

1:07:21.760 --> 1:07:25.520
 So as long as each government knows

1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:28.320
 ultimately people want that kind of protection,

1:07:29.200 --> 1:07:32.240
 there should be a plan to move towards that

1:07:32.240 --> 1:07:35.360
 as to when or how and I'm not an expert.

1:07:36.280 --> 1:07:39.040
 On the point of privacy to me, it's really interesting.

1:07:39.040 --> 1:07:42.520
 So AI needs data to create

1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:45.520
 a personalized awesome experience, right?

1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:48.560
 I'm just speaking generally in terms of products.

1:07:48.560 --> 1:07:51.360
 And then we have currently, depending on the age

1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:54.000
 and depending on the demographics of who we're talking about,

1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:55.840
 some people are more or less concerned

1:07:55.840 --> 1:07:59.040
 about the amount of data they hand over.

1:07:59.040 --> 1:08:04.040
 So in your view, how do we get this balance right

1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:07.120
 that we provide an amazing experience

1:08:07.120 --> 1:08:09.920
 to people that use products?

1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:13.440
 You look at Facebook, the more Facebook knows about you,

1:08:13.440 --> 1:08:18.440
 yes, it's scary to say, the better it can probably,

1:08:19.360 --> 1:08:21.200
 better experience it can probably create.

1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:23.760
 So in your view, how do we get that balance right?

1:08:25.160 --> 1:08:30.160
 Yes, I think a lot of people have a misunderstanding

1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:35.080
 that it's okay and possible to just rip all the data out

1:08:35.080 --> 1:08:38.240
 from a provider and give it back to you.

1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:41.160
 So you can deny them access to further data

1:08:41.160 --> 1:08:44.080
 and still enjoy the services we have.

1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:46.240
 If we take back all the data,

1:08:46.240 --> 1:08:48.360
 all the services will give us nonsense.

1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:52.360
 We'll no longer be able to use products that function well

1:08:52.360 --> 1:08:56.160
 in terms of right ranking, right products,

1:08:56.160 --> 1:08:57.880
 right user experience.

1:08:57.880 --> 1:09:02.880
 So yet I do understand we don't want to permit misuse

1:09:02.880 --> 1:09:07.520
 of the data from legal policy standpoint.

1:09:07.520 --> 1:09:11.160
 I think there can be severe punishment

1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:16.200
 for those who have egregious misuse of the data.

1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:19.600
 That's I think a good first step.

1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:22.680
 Actually China in this side on this aspect

1:09:22.680 --> 1:09:25.480
 has very strong laws about people who sell

1:09:25.480 --> 1:09:27.960
 or give data to other companies.

1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:30.080
 And that over the past few years,

1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:33.560
 since that law came into effect,

1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:38.560
 pretty much eradicated the illegal distribution,

1:09:38.760 --> 1:09:40.560
 sharing of data.

1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:44.120
 Additionally, I think giving,

1:09:45.440 --> 1:09:50.120
 I think technology is often a very good way

1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:52.760
 to solve technology misuse.

1:09:52.760 --> 1:09:56.200
 So can we come up with new technologies

1:09:56.200 --> 1:09:58.880
 that will let us have our cake and eat it too?

1:09:58.880 --> 1:10:01.960
 People are looking into homomorphic encryption,

1:10:01.960 --> 1:10:04.360
 which is letting you keep the data,

1:10:04.360 --> 1:10:07.360
 have it encrypted and train on encrypted data.

1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:09.080
 Of course, we haven't solved that one yet,

1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:12.480
 but that kind of direction may be worth pursuing.

1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:15.160
 Also federated learning,

1:10:15.160 --> 1:10:17.240
 which would allow one hospital

1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:20.000
 to train on its hospital's patient data fully

1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.400
 because they have a license for that.

1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:24.800
 And then hospitals would then share their models,

1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:28.040
 not data, but models to create a super AI.

1:10:28.040 --> 1:10:30.560
 And that also maybe has some promise.

1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:34.160
 So I would want to encourage us to be open minded

1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:39.160
 and think of this as not just the policy binary, yes, no,

1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:42.800
 but letting the technologists try to find solutions

1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:44.840
 to let us have our cake and eat it too,

1:10:44.840 --> 1:10:47.440
 or have most of our cake and eat most of it too.

1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:52.920
 Finally, I think giving each end user a choice is important

1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:55.400
 and having transparency is important.

1:10:55.400 --> 1:10:57.400
 Also, I think that's universal,

1:10:57.400 --> 1:11:00.560
 but the choice you give to the user

1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:02.320
 should not be at a granular level

1:11:02.320 --> 1:11:04.720
 that the user cannot understand.

1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:09.120
 GDPR today causes all these popups of yes, no,

1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:10.560
 will you give this site this right

1:11:10.560 --> 1:11:12.360
 to use this part of your data?

1:11:12.360 --> 1:11:15.000
 I don't think any user understands

1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000
 what they're saying yes or no to.

1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:18.960
 And I suspect most are just saying yes

1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:20.760
 because they don't understand it.

1:11:20.760 --> 1:11:25.600
 So while GDPR in its current implementation

1:11:25.600 --> 1:11:30.360
 has lived up to its promise of transparency and user choice,

1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:33.000
 it implemented it in such a way

1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:38.000
 that really didn't deliver the spirit of GDPR.

1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:41.560
 It fit the letter, but not the spirit.

1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:43.760
 So again, I think we need to think about

1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:48.000
 is there a way to fit the spirit of GDPR

1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.600
 by using some kind of technology?

1:11:50.600 --> 1:11:54.640
 Can we have a slider that's an AI trying to figure out

1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:57.520
 how much you want to slide between

1:11:57.520 --> 1:12:01.520
 perfect protection security of your personal data

1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:04.080
 versus a high degree of convenience

1:12:04.080 --> 1:12:06.960
 with some risks of not having full privacy?

1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:10.080
 Each user should have some preference

1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:12.000
 and that gives you the user choice.

1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:14.840
 But maybe we should turn the problem on its head

1:12:14.840 --> 1:12:18.840
 and ask can there be an AI algorithm that can customize this?

1:12:18.840 --> 1:12:21.120
 Because we can understand the slider,

1:12:21.120 --> 1:12:25.080
 but we sure cannot understand every popup question.

1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:27.200
 And I think getting that right

1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:29.720
 requires getting the balance between

1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:30.760
 what we talked about earlier,

1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:32.720
 which is heart and soul

1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:37.120
 versus profit driven decisions and strategy.

1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:40.200
 I think from my perspective,

1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:43.080
 the best way to make a lot of money in the long term

1:12:43.080 --> 1:12:45.360
 is to keep your heart and soul intact.

1:12:46.760 --> 1:12:50.640
 I think getting that slider right in the short term

1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:54.080
 may feel like you'll be sacrificing profit,

1:12:54.080 --> 1:12:55.760
 but in the long term,

1:12:55.760 --> 1:12:57.600
 you'll be gaining user trust

1:12:57.600 --> 1:12:59.520
 and providing a great experience.

1:12:59.520 --> 1:13:02.000
 Do you share that kind of view in general?

1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:03.240
 Yes, absolutely.

1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:07.200
 I sure would hope there is a way

1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:09.600
 we can do long term projects

1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:12.000
 that really do the right thing.

1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:15.240
 I think a lot of people who embrace GDPR,

1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:16.960
 their heart's in the right place.

1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:20.680
 I think they just need to figure out how to build a solution.

1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:23.360
 I've heard utopians talk about solutions

1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:24.480
 that get me excited,

1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:27.880
 but I'm not sure how in the current funding environment

1:13:27.880 --> 1:13:29.320
 they can get started.

1:13:29.320 --> 1:13:30.600
 People talk about,

1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:35.600
 imagine this crowdsourced data collection

1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:37.880
 that we all trust.

1:13:37.880 --> 1:13:40.720
 And then we have these agents

1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:45.720
 that we ask the trusted agent to...

1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:48.880
 That agent only, that platform,

1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:51.280
 so a trusted joint platform

1:13:51.280 --> 1:13:55.120
 that we all believe is trustworthy,

1:13:55.120 --> 1:14:00.120
 that can give us all the closed loop personal suggestions

1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:06.200
 by the new social network, new search engine,

1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:08.600
 new eCommerce engine that has access

1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:10.360
 to even more of our data,

1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:12.400
 but not directly, but indirectly.

1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:14.640
 So I think that general concept

1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:18.520
 of licensing to some trusted engine

1:14:18.520 --> 1:14:20.640
 and finding a way to trust that engine

1:14:20.640 --> 1:14:22.360
 seems like a great idea.

1:14:22.360 --> 1:14:24.240
 But if you think how long it's gonna take

1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:27.760
 to implement and tweak and develop it right,

1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:29.920
 as well as to collect all the trusts

1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:31.360
 and the data from the people,

1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:34.960
 it's beyond the current cycle of venture capital.

1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:38.120
 So how do you do that is a big question.

1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:41.840
 You've recently had a fight with cancer,

1:14:41.840 --> 1:14:46.840
 stage four lymphoma and in a sort of deep personal level,

1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:51.080
 what did it feel like in the darker moments

1:14:51.080 --> 1:14:52.880
 to face your own mortality?

1:14:54.840 --> 1:14:57.880
 Well, I've been the workaholic my whole life

1:14:57.880 --> 1:15:01.400
 and I've basically worked nine, nine, six,

1:15:01.400 --> 1:15:04.640
 nine a.m. to nine p.m. six days a week, roughly.

1:15:04.640 --> 1:15:07.920
 And I didn't really pay a lot of attention

1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:10.680
 to my family, friends, and people who loved me.

1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:14.480
 And my life revolved around optimizing for work.

1:15:14.480 --> 1:15:16.920
 While my work was not routine,

1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:21.800
 my optimization really what made my life

1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:25.640
 basically very mechanical process.

1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:28.360
 But I got a lot of highs out of it

1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:30.960
 because of accomplishments

1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:34.400
 that I thought were really important and dear

1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:36.720
 and the highest priority to me.

1:15:36.720 --> 1:15:38.560
 But when I faced mortality

1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:41.960
 and the possible death in matter of months,

1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:45.600
 I suddenly realized that this really meant nothing to me,

1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:48.560
 that I didn't feel like working for another minute,

1:15:48.560 --> 1:15:51.000
 that if I had six months left in my life,

1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:54.280
 I would spend it all with my loved ones

1:15:54.280 --> 1:15:57.480
 and thanking them, giving them love back

1:15:57.480 --> 1:16:01.960
 and apologizing to them that I lived my life the wrong way.

1:16:01.960 --> 1:16:05.960
 So that moment of reckoning

1:16:05.960 --> 1:16:10.960
 caused me to really rethink that why we exist in this world

1:16:11.520 --> 1:16:16.520
 is something that we might be too much shaped by the society

1:16:17.960 --> 1:16:22.040
 to think that success and accomplishments is why we live.

1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:26.320
 But while that can get you

1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:29.680
 periodic successes and satisfaction,

1:16:29.680 --> 1:16:33.200
 it's really in the facing death

1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:35.840
 you see what's truly important to you.

1:16:35.840 --> 1:16:40.840
 So as a result of going through the challenges with cancer,

1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:45.720
 I've resolved to live a more balanced lifestyle.

1:16:45.720 --> 1:16:48.920
 I'm now in remission, knock on wood,

1:16:48.920 --> 1:16:52.440
 and I'm spending more time with my family.

1:16:52.440 --> 1:16:54.800
 My wife travels with me.

1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:58.000
 When my kids need me, I spend more time with them.

1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:02.680
 And before I used to prioritize everything around work.

1:17:02.680 --> 1:17:03.960
 When I had a little bit of time,

1:17:03.960 --> 1:17:06.240
 I would dole it out to my family.

1:17:06.240 --> 1:17:09.880
 Now, when my family needs something, really needs something,

1:17:09.880 --> 1:17:12.640
 I drop everything at work and go to them.

1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:15.880
 And then in the time remaining, I allocate to work.

1:17:15.880 --> 1:17:19.000
 But one's family is very understanding.

1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:23.160
 It's not like they will take 50 hours a week from me.

1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:27.120
 So I'm actually able to still work pretty hard,

1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:29.280
 maybe 10 hours less per week.

1:17:29.280 --> 1:17:32.720
 So I realized the most important thing in my life

1:17:32.720 --> 1:17:36.280
 is really love and the people I love.

1:17:36.280 --> 1:17:38.680
 And I give that the highest priority.

1:17:38.680 --> 1:17:40.680
 It isn't the only thing I do,

1:17:40.680 --> 1:17:45.680
 but when that is needed, I put that at the top priority

1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:50.080
 and I feel much better and I feel much more balanced.

1:17:50.080 --> 1:17:53.080
 And I think this also gives a hint

1:17:53.080 --> 1:17:58.080
 as to a life of routine work, a life of pursuit of numbers.

1:17:58.080 --> 1:18:02.920
 While my job was not routine, it was in pursuit of numbers,

1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:04.960
 pursuit of can I make more money?

1:18:04.960 --> 1:18:07.360
 Can I fund more great companies?

1:18:07.360 --> 1:18:08.920
 Can I raise more money?

1:18:08.920 --> 1:18:12.080
 Can I make sure our VC is ranked higher and higher

1:18:12.080 --> 1:18:13.360
 every year?

1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:18.360
 This competitive nature of driving for bigger numbers

1:18:18.800 --> 1:18:23.800
 and better numbers became a endless pursuit

1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:26.640
 that's mechanical.

1:18:26.640 --> 1:18:31.640
 And bigger numbers really didn't make me happier.

1:18:31.880 --> 1:18:34.680
 And faced with death, I realized bigger numbers

1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:36.360
 really meant nothing.

1:18:36.360 --> 1:18:41.040
 And what was important is that people who have given

1:18:41.040 --> 1:18:42.840
 their heart and their love to me

1:18:42.840 --> 1:18:45.640
 deserve for me to do the same.

1:18:45.640 --> 1:18:48.400
 So there's deep, profound truth in that,

1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:52.000
 that everyone should hear and internalize.

1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:55.420
 I mean, that's really powerful for you to say that.

1:18:55.420 --> 1:19:00.420
 I have to ask sort of a difficult question here.

1:19:03.060 --> 1:19:06.020
 So I've competed in sports my whole life,

1:19:06.020 --> 1:19:11.020
 looking historically, I'd like to challenge some aspect

1:19:11.780 --> 1:19:15.220
 of that a little bit on the point of hard work.

1:19:15.220 --> 1:19:18.900
 That it feels that there are certain aspects

1:19:18.900 --> 1:19:22.020
 that is the greatest, the most beautiful aspects

1:19:22.020 --> 1:19:26.440
 of human nature is the ability to become obsessed,

1:19:27.740 --> 1:19:31.460
 of becoming extremely passionate to the point where yes,

1:19:31.460 --> 1:19:36.460
 flaws are revealed and just giving yourself fully to a task.

1:19:37.460 --> 1:19:40.800
 That is, in another sense, you mentioned love

1:19:40.800 --> 1:19:42.380
 being important, but in another sense,

1:19:42.380 --> 1:19:46.660
 this kind of obsession, this pure exhibition of passion

1:19:46.660 --> 1:19:50.380
 and hard work is truly what it means to be human.

1:19:50.380 --> 1:19:53.140
 What lessons should we take that's deeper?

1:19:53.140 --> 1:19:54.820
 Because you've accomplished incredible things.

1:19:54.820 --> 1:19:57.300
 You say it chasing numbers,

1:19:57.300 --> 1:20:00.980
 but really there's some incredible work there.

1:20:00.980 --> 1:20:04.980
 So how do you think about that when you look back

1:20:04.980 --> 1:20:09.980
 in your 20s, your 30s, what would you do differently?

1:20:10.020 --> 1:20:14.860
 Would you really take back some of the incredible hard work?

1:20:14.860 --> 1:20:19.860
 I would, but it's in percentages, right?

1:20:19.980 --> 1:20:22.380
 We're both computer scientists.

1:20:22.380 --> 1:20:25.620
 So I think when one balances one's life,

1:20:25.620 --> 1:20:30.260
 when one is younger, you might give a smaller percentage

1:20:30.260 --> 1:20:33.720
 to family, but you would still give them high priority.

1:20:33.720 --> 1:20:36.340
 And when you get older, you would give a larger percentage

1:20:36.340 --> 1:20:38.500
 to them and still the high priority.

1:20:38.500 --> 1:20:42.460
 And when you're near retirement, you give most of it to them

1:20:42.460 --> 1:20:43.820
 and the highest priority.

1:20:43.820 --> 1:20:48.820
 So I think the key point is not that we would work 20 hours

1:20:49.140 --> 1:20:52.700
 less for the whole life and just spend it aimlessly

1:20:52.700 --> 1:20:56.740
 with the family, but that's when the family has a need,

1:20:56.740 --> 1:21:00.260
 when your wife is having a baby,

1:21:00.260 --> 1:21:05.180
 when your daughter has a birthday or when they're depressed

1:21:05.180 --> 1:21:07.540
 or when they're celebrating something

1:21:07.540 --> 1:21:11.400
 or when they have a get together or when we have family time

1:21:11.400 --> 1:21:14.860
 that it's important for us to put down our phone and PC

1:21:14.860 --> 1:21:18.340
 and be a hundred percent with them.

1:21:18.340 --> 1:21:23.340
 And that priority on the things that really matter

1:21:23.740 --> 1:21:28.060
 isn't going to be so taxing that it would eliminate

1:21:29.140 --> 1:21:32.020
 or even dramatically reduce our accomplishments.

1:21:32.020 --> 1:21:35.180
 It might have some impact, but it might also have

1:21:35.180 --> 1:21:37.940
 other impact because if you have a happier family,

1:21:37.940 --> 1:21:39.380
 maybe you fight less.

1:21:39.380 --> 1:21:43.100
 If you fight less, you don't spend time taking care

1:21:43.100 --> 1:21:45.620
 of all the aftermath of a fight.

1:21:45.620 --> 1:21:48.220
 So it's unclear that it would take more time.

1:21:48.220 --> 1:21:53.220
 And if it did, I'd be willing to take that reduction.

1:21:53.260 --> 1:21:56.340
 And it's not a dramatic number, but it's a number

1:21:56.340 --> 1:22:00.140
 that I think would give me a greater degree of happiness

1:22:00.140 --> 1:22:03.260
 and knowing that I've done the right thing

1:22:03.260 --> 1:22:08.260
 and still have plenty of hours to get the success

1:22:08.260 --> 1:22:09.900
 that I want to get.

1:22:09.900 --> 1:22:14.460
 So given the many successful companies that you've launched

1:22:14.460 --> 1:22:17.340
 and much success throughout your career,

1:22:17.340 --> 1:22:22.340
 what advice would you give to young people today looking,

1:22:25.440 --> 1:22:26.780
 or it doesn't have to be young,

1:22:26.780 --> 1:22:28.500
 but people today looking to launch

1:22:28.500 --> 1:22:32.360
 and to create the next $1 billion tech startup

1:22:32.360 --> 1:22:34.280
 or even AI based startup?

1:22:34.280 --> 1:22:39.280
 I would suggest that people understand

1:22:39.800 --> 1:22:42.720
 technology waves move quickly.

1:22:42.720 --> 1:22:45.920
 What worked two years ago may not work today.

1:22:45.920 --> 1:22:49.700
 And that is very much case in point for AI.

1:22:49.700 --> 1:22:53.200
 I think two years ago, or maybe three years ago,

1:22:53.200 --> 1:22:55.320
 you certainly could say I have a couple

1:22:55.320 --> 1:22:58.880
 of super smart PhDs and we're not sure

1:22:58.880 --> 1:23:01.920
 what we're gonna do, but here's how we're gonna start

1:23:01.920 --> 1:23:05.200
 and get funding for a very high valuation.

1:23:05.200 --> 1:23:08.480
 Those days are over because AI is going

1:23:08.480 --> 1:23:11.520
 from rocket science towards mainstream,

1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:14.400
 not yet commodity, but more mainstream.

1:23:14.400 --> 1:23:19.400
 So first the creation of any company

1:23:19.400 --> 1:23:22.720
 to a venture capitalists has to be creation

1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:26.200
 of business value and monetary value.

1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:29.800
 And when you have a very scarce commodity,

1:23:29.800 --> 1:23:34.800
 VCs may be willing to accept greater uncertainty.

1:23:35.040 --> 1:23:38.560
 But now the number of people who have the equivalent

1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:42.840
 of PhD three years ago, because that can be learned

1:23:42.840 --> 1:23:46.080
 more quickly, platforms are emerging,

1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:49.580
 the cost to become a AI engineer is much lower

1:23:49.580 --> 1:23:51.700
 and there are many more AI engineers.

1:23:51.700 --> 1:23:53.960
 So the market is different.

1:23:53.960 --> 1:23:57.440
 So I would suggest someone who wants to build an AI company

1:23:57.440 --> 1:24:01.480
 be thinking about the normal business questions.

1:24:01.480 --> 1:24:06.120
 What customer cases are you trying to address?

1:24:06.120 --> 1:24:08.600
 What kind of pain are you trying to address?

1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:10.680
 How does that translate to value?

1:24:10.680 --> 1:24:14.680
 How will you extract value and get paid

1:24:14.680 --> 1:24:18.120
 through what channel and how much business value

1:24:18.120 --> 1:24:19.920
 will get created?

1:24:19.920 --> 1:24:24.520
 That today needs to be thought about much earlier upfront

1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:26.720
 than it did three years ago.

1:24:26.720 --> 1:24:30.500
 The scarcity question of AI talent has changed.

1:24:30.500 --> 1:24:32.800
 The number of AI talent has changed.

1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:37.640
 So now you need not just AI, but also understanding

1:24:37.640 --> 1:24:41.000
 of business customer and the marketplace.

1:24:41.840 --> 1:24:46.840
 So I also think you should have a more reasonable

1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:52.360
 valuation expectation and growth expectation.

1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:54.080
 There's gonna be more competition.

1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:57.840
 But the good news though, is that AI technologies

1:24:57.840 --> 1:25:00.740
 are now more available in open source.

1:25:00.740 --> 1:25:05.740
 TensorFlow, PyTorch and such tools are much easier to use.

1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:11.640
 So you should be able to experiment and get results

1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:14.240
 iteratively faster than before.

1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:18.540
 So take more of a business mindset to this,

1:25:18.540 --> 1:25:23.540
 think less of this as a laboratory taken into a company,

1:25:23.540 --> 1:25:26.140
 because we've gone beyond that stage.

1:25:26.140 --> 1:25:29.740
 The only exception is if you truly have a breakthrough

1:25:29.740 --> 1:25:32.340
 in some technology that really no one has,

1:25:32.340 --> 1:25:34.660
 then the old way still works.

1:25:34.660 --> 1:25:37.140
 But I think that's harder and harder now.

1:25:37.140 --> 1:25:41.140
 So I know you believe as many do that we're far

1:25:41.140 --> 1:25:44.020
 from creating an artificial general intelligence system.

1:25:45.420 --> 1:25:50.420
 But say once we do, and you get to ask her one question,

1:25:50.420 --> 1:25:53.020
 what would that question be?

1:25:57.640 --> 1:26:00.260
 What is it that differentiates you and me?

1:26:02.180 --> 1:26:04.260
 Beautifully put, Kaifu, thank you so much

1:26:04.260 --> 1:26:05.760
 for your time today.

1:26:05.760 --> 1:26:25.760
 Thank you.
