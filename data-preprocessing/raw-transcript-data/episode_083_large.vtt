00:00.000 --> 00:05.520
 The following is a conversation with Nick Bostrom, a philosopher at University of Oxford

00:05.520 --> 00:08.840
 and the director of the Future of Humanity Institute.

00:08.840 --> 00:15.320
 He has worked on fascinating and important ideas in existential risk, simulation hypothesis,

00:15.320 --> 00:20.480
 human enhancement ethics, and the risks of superintelligent AI systems, including in

00:20.480 --> 00:23.200
 his book, Superintelligence.

00:23.200 --> 00:27.920
 I can see talking to Nick multiple times in this podcast, many hours each time, because

00:27.920 --> 00:34.520
 he has done some incredible work in artificial intelligence, in technology, space, science,

00:34.520 --> 00:38.920
 and really philosophy in general, but we have to start somewhere.

00:38.920 --> 00:43.620
 This conversation was recorded before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic that

00:43.620 --> 00:49.240
 both Nick and I, I'm sure, will have a lot to say about next time we speak, and perhaps

00:49.240 --> 00:54.440
 that is for the best, because the deepest lessons can be learned only in retrospect

00:54.440 --> 00:56.680
 when the storm has passed.

00:56.680 --> 01:01.380
 I do recommend you read many of his papers on the topic of existential risk, including

01:01.380 --> 01:07.600
 the technical report titled Global Catastrophic Risks Survey that he coauthored with Anders

01:07.600 --> 01:08.600
 Sandberg.

01:08.600 --> 01:14.000
 For everyone feeling the medical, psychological, and financial burden of this crisis, I'm

01:14.000 --> 01:15.680
 sending love your way.

01:15.680 --> 01:16.680
 Stay strong.

01:16.680 --> 01:17.840
 We're in this together.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.880
 We'll beat this thing.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.920
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:22.920 --> 01:28.120
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, review it with five stars on Apple Podcast, support

01:28.120 --> 01:33.760
 it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M

01:33.760 --> 01:34.760
 A N.

01:34.760 --> 01:39.120
 As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that

01:39.120 --> 01:41.080
 can break the flow of the conversation.

01:41.080 --> 01:46.040
 I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

01:46.040 --> 01:50.080
 This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.

01:50.080 --> 01:53.800
 When you get it, use code LEXPODCAST.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.920
 Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with

01:57.920 --> 01:59.480
 as little as one dollar.

01:59.480 --> 02:05.200
 Since Cash App does fractional share trading, let me mention that the order execution algorithm

02:05.200 --> 02:10.360
 that works behind the scenes to create the abstraction of fractional orders is an algorithmic

02:10.360 --> 02:11.360
 marvel.

02:11.360 --> 02:16.200
 So big props to the Cash App engineers for solving a hard problem that in the end provides

02:16.200 --> 02:20.360
 an easy interface that takes a step up to the next layer of abstraction over the stock

02:20.360 --> 02:26.960
 market, making trading more accessible for new investors and diversification much easier.

02:26.960 --> 02:33.200
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play, and use the code LEXPODCAST,

02:33.200 --> 02:38.560
 you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, an organization that is helping

02:38.560 --> 02:43.960
 to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world.

02:43.960 --> 02:49.160
 And now, here's my conversation with Nick Bostrom.

02:49.160 --> 02:54.200
 At the risk of asking the Beatles to play yesterday or the Rolling Stones to play Satisfaction,

02:54.200 --> 02:56.520
 let me ask you the basics.

02:56.520 --> 02:59.520
 What is the simulation hypothesis?

02:59.520 --> 03:02.960
 That we are living in a computer simulation.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.440
 What is a computer simulation?

03:04.440 --> 03:06.760
 How are we supposed to even think about that?

03:06.760 --> 03:15.360
 Well, so the hypothesis is meant to be understood in a literal sense, not that we can kind of

03:15.360 --> 03:21.320
 metaphorically view the universe as an information processing physical system, but that there

03:21.320 --> 03:28.980
 is some advanced civilization who built a lot of computers and that what we experience

03:28.980 --> 03:34.960
 is an effect of what's going on inside one of those computers so that the world around

03:34.960 --> 03:43.800
 us, our own brains, everything we see and perceive and think and feel would exist because

03:43.800 --> 03:48.280
 this computer is running certain programs.

03:48.280 --> 03:55.320
 So do you think of this computer as something similar to the computers of today, these deterministic

03:55.320 --> 03:58.160
 sort of Turing machine type things?

03:58.160 --> 04:01.480
 Is that what we're supposed to imagine or we're supposed to think of something more

04:01.480 --> 04:07.080
 like a quantum mechanical system?

04:07.080 --> 04:11.240
 Something much bigger, something much more complicated, something much more mysterious

04:11.240 --> 04:12.840
 from our current perspective?

04:12.840 --> 04:15.400
 The ones we have today would do fine, I mean, bigger, certainly.

04:15.400 --> 04:18.720
 You'd need more memory and more processing power.

04:18.720 --> 04:21.280
 I don't think anything else would be required.

04:21.280 --> 04:26.580
 Now, it might well be that they do have additional, maybe they have quantum computers and other

04:26.580 --> 04:31.320
 things that would give them even more of, it seems kind of plausible, but I don't think

04:31.320 --> 04:38.880
 it's a necessary assumption in order to get to the conclusion that a technologically

04:38.880 --> 04:44.520
 mature civilization would be able to create these kinds of computer simulations with conscious

04:44.520 --> 04:46.640
 beings inside them.

04:46.640 --> 04:52.840
 So do you think the simulation hypothesis is an idea that's most useful in philosophy,

04:52.840 --> 05:02.480
 computer science, physics, sort of where do you see it having valuable kind of starting

05:02.480 --> 05:05.280
 point in terms of a thought experiment of it?

05:05.280 --> 05:06.280
 Is it useful?

05:06.280 --> 05:14.480
 I guess it's more informative and interesting and maybe important, but it's not designed

05:14.480 --> 05:16.560
 to be useful for something else.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.480
 Okay, interesting, sure.

05:18.480 --> 05:23.360
 But is it philosophically interesting or is there some kind of implications of computer

05:23.360 --> 05:24.900
 science and physics?

05:24.900 --> 05:29.460
 I think not so much for computer science or physics per se.

05:29.460 --> 05:37.320
 Certainly it would be of interest in philosophy, I think also to say cosmology or physics in

05:37.320 --> 05:43.860
 as much as you're interested in the fundamental building blocks of the world and the rules

05:43.860 --> 05:46.040
 that govern it.

05:46.040 --> 05:50.480
 If we are in a simulation, there is then the possibility that say physics at the level

05:50.480 --> 05:57.640
 where the computer running the simulation could be different from the physics governing

05:57.640 --> 05:59.780
 phenomena in the simulation.

05:59.780 --> 06:06.280
 So I think it might be interesting from point of view of religion or just for kind of trying

06:06.280 --> 06:09.720
 to figure out what the heck is going on.

06:09.720 --> 06:14.680
 So we mentioned the simulation hypothesis so far.

06:14.680 --> 06:19.800
 There is also the simulation argument, which I tend to make a distinction.

06:19.800 --> 06:23.080
 So simulation hypothesis, we are living in a computer simulation.

06:23.080 --> 06:27.880
 Simulation argument, this argument that tries to show that one of three propositions is

06:27.880 --> 06:34.840
 true, one of which is the simulation hypothesis, but there are two alternatives in the original

06:34.840 --> 06:36.840
 simulation argument, which we can get to.

06:36.840 --> 06:37.840
 Yeah, let's go there.

06:37.840 --> 06:43.320
 By the way, confusing terms because people will, I think, probably naturally think simulation

06:43.320 --> 06:47.160
 argument equals simulation hypothesis, just terminology wise.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.160
 But let's go there.

06:48.160 --> 06:52.560
 So simulation hypothesis means that we are living in a simulations, the hypothesis that

06:52.560 --> 06:58.840
 we're living in a simulation, simulation argument has these three complete possibilities that

06:58.840 --> 07:00.480
 cover all possibilities.

07:00.480 --> 07:01.480
 So what are they?

07:01.480 --> 07:02.480
 Yeah.

07:02.480 --> 07:03.480
 So it's like a disjunction.

07:03.480 --> 07:08.440
 It says at least one of these three is true, although it doesn't on its own tell us which

07:08.440 --> 07:10.760
 one.

07:10.760 --> 07:17.560
 So the first one is that almost all civilizations that are current stage of technological development

07:17.560 --> 07:23.820
 go extinct before they reach technological maturity.

07:23.820 --> 07:34.520
 So there is some great filter that makes it so that basically none of the civilizations

07:34.520 --> 07:41.800
 throughout maybe a vast cosmos will ever get to realize the full potential of technological

07:41.800 --> 07:42.800
 development.

07:42.800 --> 07:47.660
 And this could be, theoretically speaking, this could be because most civilizations kill

07:47.660 --> 07:52.840
 themselves too eagerly or destroy themselves too eagerly, or it might be super difficult

07:52.840 --> 07:55.200
 to build a simulation.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.400
 So the span of time.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.400
 Theoretically it could be both.

07:58.400 --> 08:04.500
 Now I think it looks like we would technologically be able to get there in a time span that

08:04.500 --> 08:13.080
 is short compared to, say, the lifetime of planets and other sort of astronomical processes.

08:13.080 --> 08:16.520
 So your intuition is to build a simulation is not...

08:16.520 --> 08:21.240
 Well, so this is interesting concept of technological maturity.

08:21.240 --> 08:25.160
 It's kind of an interesting concept to have other purposes as well.

08:25.160 --> 08:31.120
 We can see even based on our current limited understanding what some lower bound would

08:31.120 --> 08:37.480
 be on the capabilities that you could realize by just developing technologies that we already

08:37.480 --> 08:38.600
 see are possible.

08:38.600 --> 08:46.680
 So for example, one of my research fellows here, Eric Drexler, back in the 80s, studied

08:46.680 --> 08:48.560
 molecular manufacturing.

08:48.560 --> 08:55.520
 That is you could analyze using theoretical tools and computer modeling the performance

08:55.520 --> 09:01.160
 of various molecularly precise structures that we didn't then and still don't today

09:01.160 --> 09:04.100
 have the ability to actually fabricate.

09:04.100 --> 09:07.460
 But you could say that, well, if we could put these atoms together in this way, then

09:07.460 --> 09:13.760
 the system would be stable and it would rotate at this speed and have all these computational

09:13.760 --> 09:16.260
 characteristics.

09:16.260 --> 09:22.740
 And he also outlined some pathways that would enable us to get to this kind of molecularly

09:22.740 --> 09:25.000
 manufacturing in the fullness of time.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.280
 And you could do other studies we've done.

09:28.280 --> 09:33.440
 You could look at the speed at which, say, it would be possible to colonize the galaxy

09:33.440 --> 09:36.120
 if you had mature technology.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.360
 We have an upper limit, which is the speed of light.

09:38.360 --> 09:42.360
 We have sort of a lower current limit, which is how fast current rockets go.

09:42.360 --> 09:47.560
 We know we can go faster than that by just making them bigger and have more fuel and

09:47.560 --> 09:48.560
 stuff.

09:48.560 --> 09:56.120
 We can then start to describe the technological affordances that would exist once a civilization

09:56.120 --> 10:01.000
 has had enough time to develop, at least those technologies we already know are possible.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.800
 Then maybe they would discover other new physical phenomena as well that we haven't realized

10:05.800 --> 10:08.120
 that would enable them to do even more.

10:08.120 --> 10:11.480
 But at least there is this kind of basic set of capabilities.

10:11.480 --> 10:18.560
 Can you just link on that, how do we jump from molecular manufacturing to deep space

10:18.560 --> 10:23.200
 exploration to mature technology?

10:23.200 --> 10:24.200
 What's the connection there?

10:24.200 --> 10:31.340
 Well, so these would be two examples of technological capability sets that we can have a high degree

10:31.340 --> 10:38.000
 of confidence are physically possible in our universe and that a civilization that was

10:38.000 --> 10:42.720
 allowed to continue to develop its science and technology would eventually attain.

10:42.720 --> 10:48.960
 You can intuit like, we can kind of see the set of breakthroughs that are likely to happen.

10:48.960 --> 10:53.240
 So you can see like, what did you call it, the technological set?

10:53.240 --> 10:58.080
 With computers, maybe it's easiest.

10:58.080 --> 11:01.800
 One is we could just imagine bigger computers using exactly the same parts that we have.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.480
 So you can kind of scale things that way, right?

11:04.480 --> 11:07.760
 But you could also make processors a bit faster.

11:07.760 --> 11:13.080
 If you had this molecular nanotechnology that Eric Drexler described, he characterized a

11:13.080 --> 11:19.760
 kind of crude computer built with these parts that would perform at a million times the

11:19.760 --> 11:25.600
 human brain while being significantly smaller, the size of a sugar cube.

11:25.600 --> 11:30.160
 And he made no claim that that's the optimum computing structure, like for all you know,

11:30.160 --> 11:33.660
 we could build faster computers that would be more efficient, but at least you could

11:33.660 --> 11:37.200
 do that if you had the ability to do things that were atomically precise.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.600
 I mean, so you can then combine these two.

11:39.600 --> 11:45.600
 You could have this kind of nanomolecular ability to build things atom by atom and then

11:45.600 --> 11:53.040
 say at this as a spatial scale that would be attainable through space colonizing technology.

11:53.040 --> 11:58.200
 You could then start, for example, to characterize a lower bound on the amount of computing power

11:58.200 --> 12:01.840
 that a technologically mature civilization would have.

12:01.840 --> 12:07.680
 If it could grab resources, you know, planets and so forth, and then use this molecular

12:07.680 --> 12:15.320
 nanotechnology to optimize them for computing, you'd get a very, very high lower bound on

12:15.320 --> 12:17.000
 the amount of compute.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.120
 So sorry, just to define some terms, so technologically mature civilization is one that took that

12:22.120 --> 12:26.220
 piece of technology to its lower bound.

12:26.220 --> 12:27.920
 What is a technologically mature civilization?

12:27.920 --> 12:31.160
 So that means it's a stronger concept than we really need for the simulation hypothesis.

12:31.160 --> 12:34.040
 I just think it's interesting in its own right.

12:34.040 --> 12:38.880
 So it would be the idea that there is some stage of technological development where you've

12:38.880 --> 12:45.320
 basically maxed out, that you developed all those general purpose, widely useful technologies

12:45.320 --> 12:51.600
 that could be developed, or at least kind of come very close to the, you know, 99.9%

12:51.600 --> 12:53.440
 there or something.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.160
 So that's an independent question.

12:55.160 --> 12:59.480
 You can think either that there is such a ceiling, or you might think it just goes,

12:59.480 --> 13:03.200
 the technology tree just goes on forever.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.600
 Where does your sense fall?

13:04.600 --> 13:10.000
 I would guess that there is a maximum that you would start to asymptote towards.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.900
 So new things won't keep springing up, new ceilings.

13:13.900 --> 13:18.980
 In terms of basic technological capabilities, I think that, yeah, there is like a finite

13:18.980 --> 13:23.840
 set of laws that can exist in this universe.

13:23.840 --> 13:30.120
 Moreover, I mean, I wouldn't be that surprised if we actually reached close to that level

13:30.120 --> 13:33.980
 fairly shortly after we have, say, machine superintelligence.

13:33.980 --> 13:39.760
 So I don't think it would take millions of years for a human originating civilization

13:39.760 --> 13:42.760
 to begin to do this.

13:42.760 --> 13:46.680
 It's more likely to happen on historical timescales.

13:46.680 --> 13:51.320
 But that's an independent speculation from the simulation argument.

13:51.320 --> 13:55.080
 I mean, for the purpose of the simulation argument, it doesn't really matter whether

13:55.080 --> 13:59.400
 it goes indefinitely far up or whether there is a ceiling, as long as we know we can at

13:59.400 --> 14:01.880
 least get to a certain level.

14:01.880 --> 14:06.720
 And it also doesn't matter whether that's going to happen in 100 years or 5,000 years

14:06.720 --> 14:08.440
 or 50 million years.

14:08.440 --> 14:11.600
 Like the timescales really don't make any difference for this.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.360
 Can you look on that a little bit?

14:13.360 --> 14:19.080
 Like there's a big difference between 100 years and 10 million years.

14:19.080 --> 14:25.500
 So it doesn't really not matter because you just said it doesn't matter if we jump scales

14:25.500 --> 14:28.680
 to beyond historical scales.

14:28.680 --> 14:30.200
 So we described that.

14:30.200 --> 14:40.840
 So for the simulation argument, sort of doesn't it matter that we if it takes 10 million years,

14:40.840 --> 14:44.720
 it gives us a lot more opportunity to destroy civilization in the meantime?

14:44.720 --> 14:49.840
 Yeah, well, so it would shift around the probabilities between these three alternatives.

14:49.840 --> 14:54.840
 That is, if we are very, very far away from being able to create these simulations, if

14:54.840 --> 14:58.800
 it's like, say, billions of years into the future, then it's more likely that we will

14:58.800 --> 14:59.800
 fail ever to get there.

14:59.800 --> 15:04.080
 There's more time for us to kind of go extinct along the way.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.360
 And so this is similarly for other civilizations.

15:06.360 --> 15:11.000
 So it is important to think about how hard it is to build a simulation.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.580
 In terms of figuring out which of the disjuncts.

15:14.580 --> 15:19.360
 But for the simulation argument itself, which is agnostic as to which of these three alternatives

15:19.360 --> 15:20.360
 is true.

15:20.360 --> 15:21.360
 Yeah.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.360
 Okay.

15:22.360 --> 15:26.720
 It's like you don't have to like the simulation argument would be true whether or not we thought

15:26.720 --> 15:29.840
 this could be done in 500 years or it would take 500 million years.

15:29.840 --> 15:30.840
 No, for sure.

15:30.840 --> 15:31.840
 The simulation argument stands.

15:31.840 --> 15:36.200
 I mean, I'm sure there might be some people who oppose it, but it doesn't matter.

15:36.200 --> 15:39.480
 I mean, it's very nice those three cases cover it.

15:39.480 --> 15:44.240
 But the fun part is at least not saying what the probabilities are, but kind of thinking

15:44.240 --> 15:50.480
 about kind of intuiting reasoning about what's more likely, what are the kind of things that

15:50.480 --> 15:54.400
 would make some of the arguments less and more so like.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.520
 But let's actually, I don't think we went through them.

15:56.520 --> 16:00.440
 So number one is we destroy ourselves before we ever create simulation.

16:00.440 --> 16:01.440
 Right.

16:01.440 --> 16:07.960
 So that's kind of sad, but we have to think not just what might destroy us.

16:07.960 --> 16:14.180
 I mean, so there could be some whatever disaster, some meteor slamming the earth a few years

16:14.180 --> 16:16.120
 from now that could destroy us.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.120
 Right.

16:17.120 --> 16:24.880
 But you'd have to postulate in order for this first disjunct to be true that almost all

16:24.880 --> 16:32.200
 civilizations throughout the cosmos also failed to reach technological maturity.

16:32.200 --> 16:37.680
 And the underlying assumption there is that there is likely a very large number of other

16:37.680 --> 16:39.520
 intelligent civilizations.

16:39.520 --> 16:45.280
 Well, if there are, yeah, then they would virtually all have to succumb in the same

16:45.280 --> 16:46.280
 way.

16:46.280 --> 16:50.120
 I mean, then that leads off another, I guess there are a lot of little digressions that

16:50.120 --> 16:51.120
 are interesting.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.120
 Definitely, let's go there.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.120
 Let's go there.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.120
 Keep dragging us back.

16:54.120 --> 16:58.940
 Well, there are these, there is a set of basic questions that always come up in conversations

16:58.940 --> 17:05.500
 with interesting people, like the Fermi paradox, like there's like, you could almost define

17:05.500 --> 17:09.920
 whether a person is interesting, whether at some point the question of the Fermi paradox

17:09.920 --> 17:16.920
 comes up, like, well, so for what it's worth, it looks to me that the universe is very big.

17:16.920 --> 17:23.160
 I mean, in fact, according to the most popular current cosmological theories, infinitely

17:23.160 --> 17:25.320
 big.

17:25.320 --> 17:31.420
 And so then it would follow pretty trivially that it would contain a lot of other civilizations,

17:31.420 --> 17:34.120
 in fact, infinitely many.

17:34.120 --> 17:39.660
 If you have some local stochasticity and infinitely many, it's like, you know, infinitely many

17:39.660 --> 17:43.320
 lumps of matter, one next to another, there's kind of random stuff in each one, then you're

17:43.320 --> 17:51.160
 going to get all possible outcomes with probability one infinitely repeated.

17:51.160 --> 17:54.640
 So then certainly there would be a lot of extraterrestrials out there.

17:54.640 --> 18:02.660
 Even short of that, if the universe is very big, that might be a finite but large number.

18:02.660 --> 18:09.920
 If we were literally the only one, yeah, then of course, if we went extinct, then all of

18:09.920 --> 18:14.400
 civilizations at our current stage would have gone extinct before becoming technological

18:14.400 --> 18:15.400
 material.

18:15.400 --> 18:22.560
 So then it kind of becomes trivially true that a very high fraction of those went extinct.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.480
 But if we think there are many, I mean, it's interesting, because there are certain things

18:25.480 --> 18:35.840
 that possibly could kill us, like if you look at existential risks, and it might be a different,

18:35.840 --> 18:40.280
 like the best answer to what would be most likely to kill us might be a different answer

18:40.280 --> 18:46.920
 than the best answer to the question, if there is something that kills almost everyone, what

18:46.920 --> 18:47.920
 would that be?

18:47.920 --> 18:53.400
 Because that would have to be some risk factor that was kind of uniform overall possible

18:53.400 --> 18:54.400
 civilization.

18:54.400 --> 18:59.760
 So in this, for the sake of this argument, you have to think about not just us, but like

18:59.760 --> 19:05.160
 every civilization dies out before they create the simulation or something very close to

19:05.160 --> 19:06.160
 everybody.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.160
 Okay.

19:07.160 --> 19:14.080
 So what's number two in the number two is the convergence hypothesis that is that maybe

19:14.080 --> 19:18.760
 like a lot of some of these civilizations do make it through to technological maturity,

19:18.760 --> 19:26.400
 but out of those who do get there, they all lose interest in creating these simulations.

19:26.400 --> 19:32.960
 So they just have the capability of doing it, but they choose not to.

19:32.960 --> 19:40.260
 Not just a few of them decide not to, but out of a million, maybe not even a single

19:40.260 --> 19:41.760
 one of them would do it.

19:41.760 --> 19:48.880
 And I think when you say lose interest, that sounds like unlikely because it's like they

19:48.880 --> 19:53.680
 get bored or whatever, but it could be so many possibilities within that.

19:53.680 --> 20:02.380
 I mean, losing interest could be, it could be anything from it being exceptionally difficult

20:02.380 --> 20:09.440
 to do to fundamentally changing the sort of the fabric of reality.

20:09.440 --> 20:14.400
 If you do it is ethical concerns, all those kinds of things could be exceptionally strong

20:14.400 --> 20:15.400
 pressures.

20:15.400 --> 20:18.440
 Well, certainly, I mean, yeah, ethical concerns.

20:18.440 --> 20:21.160
 I mean, not really too difficult to do.

20:21.160 --> 20:26.000
 I mean, in a sense, that's the first assumption that you get to technological maturity where

20:26.000 --> 20:32.600
 you would have the ability using only a tiny fraction of your resources to create many,

20:32.600 --> 20:34.520
 many simulations.

20:34.520 --> 20:39.760
 So it wouldn't be the case that they would need to spend half of their GDP forever in

20:39.760 --> 20:43.480
 order to create one simulation and they had this like difficult debate about whether they

20:43.480 --> 20:46.400
 should invest half of their GDP for this.

20:46.400 --> 20:50.320
 It would more be like, well, if any little fraction of the civilization feels like doing

20:50.320 --> 20:57.000
 this at any point during maybe their millions of years of existence, then that would be

20:57.000 --> 21:00.560
 millions of simulations.

21:00.560 --> 21:07.800
 But certainly, there could be many conceivable reasons for why there would be this convert,

21:07.800 --> 21:13.020
 many possible reasons for not running ancestor simulations or other computer simulations,

21:13.020 --> 21:15.160
 even if you could do so cheaply.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.160
 By the way, what's an ancestor simulation?

21:17.160 --> 21:24.880
 Well, that would be the type of computer simulation that would contain people like those we think

21:24.880 --> 21:30.060
 have lived on our planet in the past and like ourselves in terms of the types of experiences

21:30.060 --> 21:33.560
 they have and where those simulated people are conscious.

21:33.560 --> 21:41.400
 So like not just simulated in the same sense that a non player character would be simulated

21:41.400 --> 21:45.560
 in the current computer game where it's kind of has like an avatar body and then a very

21:45.560 --> 21:49.880
 simple mechanism that moves it forward or backwards.

21:49.880 --> 21:56.880
 But something where the simulated being has a brain, let's say that's simulated at a sufficient

21:56.880 --> 22:03.400
 level of granularity that it would have the same subjective experiences as we have.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.400
 So where does consciousness fit into this?

22:06.400 --> 22:10.380
 Do you think simulation, I guess there are different ways to think about how this can

22:10.380 --> 22:14.320
 be simulated, just like you're talking about now.

22:14.320 --> 22:21.040
 Do we have to simulate each brain within the larger simulation?

22:21.040 --> 22:26.840
 Is it enough to simulate just the brain, just the minds and not the simulation, not the

22:26.840 --> 22:27.840
 universe itself?

22:27.840 --> 22:29.880
 Like, is there a different ways to think about this?

22:29.880 --> 22:38.280
 Yeah, I guess there is a kind of premise in the simulation argument rolled in from philosophy

22:38.280 --> 22:45.200
 of mind that is that it would be possible to create a conscious mind in a computer.

22:45.200 --> 22:51.680
 And that what determines whether some system is conscious or not is not like whether it's

22:51.680 --> 22:56.880
 built from organic biological neurons, but maybe something like what the structure of

22:56.880 --> 22:59.680
 the computation is that it implements.

22:59.680 --> 23:05.860
 So we can discuss that if we want, but I think it would be more forward as far as my view

23:05.860 --> 23:15.140
 that it would be sufficient, say, if you had a computation that was identical to the computation

23:15.140 --> 23:17.520
 in the human brain down to the level of neurons.

23:17.520 --> 23:21.040
 So if you had a simulation with 100 billion neurons connected in the same way as the human

23:21.040 --> 23:27.520
 brain, and you then roll that forward with the same kind of synaptic weights and so forth,

23:27.520 --> 23:33.320
 so you actually had the same behavior coming out of this as a human with that brain would

23:33.320 --> 23:36.000
 have done, then I think that would be conscious.

23:36.000 --> 23:43.200
 Now it's possible you could also generate consciousness without having that detailed

23:43.200 --> 23:50.080
 assimilation, there I'm getting more uncertain exactly how much you could simplify or abstract

23:50.080 --> 23:51.080
 away.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.080
 Can you look on that?

23:52.080 --> 23:53.080
 What do you mean?

23:53.080 --> 23:56.920
 I missed where you're placing consciousness in the second.

23:56.920 --> 24:01.800
 Well, so if you are a computationalist, do you think that what creates consciousness

24:01.800 --> 24:04.880
 is the implementation of a computation?

24:04.880 --> 24:07.760
 Some property, emergent property of the computation itself.

24:07.760 --> 24:08.760
 Yeah.

24:08.760 --> 24:09.760
 That's the idea.

24:09.760 --> 24:10.760
 Yeah, you could say that.

24:10.760 --> 24:16.960
 But then the question is, what's the class of computations such that when they are run,

24:16.960 --> 24:18.160
 consciousness emerges?

24:18.160 --> 24:24.040
 So if you just have something that adds one plus one plus one plus one, like a simple

24:24.040 --> 24:28.760
 computation, you think maybe that's not going to have any consciousness.

24:28.760 --> 24:36.160
 If on the other hand, the computation is one like our human brains are performing, where

24:36.160 --> 24:43.440
 as part of the computation, there is a global workspace, a sophisticated attention mechanism,

24:43.440 --> 24:50.280
 there is self representations of other cognitive processes and a whole lot of other things

24:50.280 --> 24:52.920
 that possibly would be conscious.

24:52.920 --> 24:56.680
 And in fact, if it's exactly like ours, I think definitely it would.

24:56.680 --> 25:02.880
 But exactly how much less than the full computation that the human brain is performing would be

25:02.880 --> 25:09.320
 required is a little bit, I think, of an open question.

25:09.320 --> 25:17.640
 He asked another interesting question as well, which is, would it be sufficient to just have

25:17.640 --> 25:24.840
 say the brain or would you need the environment in order to generate the same kind of experiences

25:24.840 --> 25:26.600
 that we have?

25:26.600 --> 25:29.200
 And there is a bunch of stuff we don't know.

25:29.200 --> 25:35.440
 I mean, if you look at, say, current virtual reality environments, one thing that's clear

25:35.440 --> 25:40.800
 is that we don't have to simulate all details of them all the time in order for, say, the

25:40.800 --> 25:47.000
 human player to have the perception that there is a full reality and that you can have say

25:47.000 --> 25:51.160
 procedurally generated where you might only render a scene when it's actually within the

25:51.160 --> 25:55.440
 view of the player character.

25:55.440 --> 26:06.440
 And so similarly, if this environment that we perceive is simulated, it might be that

26:06.440 --> 26:10.520
 all of the parts that come into our view are rendered at any given time.

26:10.520 --> 26:16.680
 And a lot of aspects that never come into view, say the details of this microphone I'm

26:16.680 --> 26:23.160
 talking into, exactly what each atom is doing at any given point in time, might not be part

26:23.160 --> 26:27.200
 of the simulation, only a more coarse grained representation.

26:27.200 --> 26:31.560
 So that to me is actually from an engineering perspective, why the simulation hypothesis

26:31.560 --> 26:39.960
 is really interesting to think about is how difficult is it to fake sort of in a virtual

26:39.960 --> 26:45.000
 reality context, I don't know if fake is the right word, but to construct a reality that

26:45.000 --> 26:52.080
 is sufficiently real to us to be immersive in the way that the physical world is.

26:52.080 --> 26:59.400
 I think that's actually probably an answerable question of psychology, of computer science,

26:59.400 --> 27:06.600
 of how, where's the line where it becomes so immersive that you don't want to leave

27:06.600 --> 27:07.600
 that world?

27:07.600 --> 27:13.080
 Yeah, or that you don't realize while you're in it that it is a virtual world.

27:13.080 --> 27:17.760
 Yeah, those are two actually questions, yours is the more sort of the good question about

27:17.760 --> 27:23.120
 the realism, but mine, from my perspective, what's interesting is it doesn't have to be

27:23.120 --> 27:29.480
 real, but how can we construct a world that we wouldn't want to leave?

27:29.480 --> 27:34.440
 Yeah, I mean, I think that might be too low a bar, I mean, if you think, say when people

27:34.440 --> 27:38.600
 first had pong or something like that, I'm sure there were people who wanted to keep

27:38.600 --> 27:44.720
 playing it for a long time because it was fun and they wanted to be in this little world.

27:44.720 --> 27:48.680
 I'm not sure we would say it's immersive, I mean, I guess in some sense it is, but like

27:48.680 --> 27:51.360
 an absorbing activity doesn't even have to be.

27:51.360 --> 27:54.240
 But they left that world though, that's the thing.

27:54.240 --> 27:59.000
 So like, I think that bar is deceivingly high.

27:59.000 --> 28:05.600
 So they eventually left, so you can play pong or Starcraft or whatever more sophisticated

28:05.600 --> 28:12.360
 games for hours, for months, you know, while the work has to be in a big addiction, but

28:12.360 --> 28:13.880
 eventually they escaped that.

28:13.880 --> 28:19.560
 So you mean when it's absorbing enough that you would spend your entire, you would choose

28:19.560 --> 28:21.160
 to spend your entire life in there.

28:21.160 --> 28:28.520
 And then thereby changing the concept of what reality is, because your reality becomes the

28:28.520 --> 28:29.620
 game.

28:29.620 --> 28:33.320
 Not because you're fooled, but because you've made that choice.

28:33.320 --> 28:38.880
 Yeah, and it made, different people might have different preferences regarding that.

28:38.880 --> 28:47.640
 Some might, even if you had any perfect virtual reality, might still prefer not to spend the

28:47.640 --> 28:49.160
 rest of their lives there.

28:49.160 --> 28:53.880
 I mean, in philosophy, there's this experience machine, thought experiment.

28:53.880 --> 28:55.920
 Have you come across this?

28:55.920 --> 29:03.960
 So Robert Nozick had this thought experiment where you imagine some crazy super duper neuroscientist

29:03.960 --> 29:08.160
 of the future have created a machine that could give you any experience you want if

29:08.160 --> 29:10.280
 you step in there.

29:10.280 --> 29:15.840
 And for the rest of your life, you can kind of pre programmed it in different ways.

29:15.840 --> 29:24.240
 So your fun dreams could come true, you could, whatever you dream, you want to be a great

29:24.240 --> 29:29.320
 artist, a great lover, like have a wonderful life, all of these things.

29:29.320 --> 29:36.400
 If you step into the experience machine will be your experiences, constantly happy.

29:36.400 --> 29:39.120
 But you would kind of disconnect from the rest of reality and you would float there

29:39.120 --> 29:41.760
 in a tank.

29:41.760 --> 29:48.960
 And so Nozick thought that most people would choose not to enter the experience machine.

29:48.960 --> 29:51.880
 I mean, many might want to go there for a holiday, but they wouldn't want to have to

29:51.880 --> 29:54.560
 check out of existence permanently.

29:54.560 --> 30:01.480
 And so he thought that was an argument against certain views of value according to what we

30:01.480 --> 30:04.760
 value is a function of what we experience.

30:04.760 --> 30:08.560
 Because in the experience machine, you could have any experience you want, and yet many

30:08.560 --> 30:12.000
 people would think that would not be much value.

30:12.000 --> 30:18.600
 So therefore, what we value depends on other things than what we experience.

30:18.600 --> 30:21.920
 So okay, can you can you take that argument further?

30:21.920 --> 30:25.120
 What about the fact that maybe what we value is the up and down of life?

30:25.120 --> 30:29.080
 So you could have up and downs in the experience machine, right?

30:29.080 --> 30:31.080
 But what can't you have in the experience machine?

30:31.080 --> 30:35.480
 Well, I mean, that then becomes an interesting question to explore.

30:35.480 --> 30:40.480
 But for example, real connection with other people, if the experience machine is a solo

30:40.480 --> 30:44.920
 machine where it's only you, like that's something you wouldn't have there.

30:44.920 --> 30:49.440
 You would have this subjective experience that would be like fake people.

30:49.440 --> 30:53.840
 But when if you gave somebody flowers, there wouldn't be anybody there who actually got

30:53.840 --> 30:54.840
 happy.

30:54.840 --> 30:58.480
 It would just be a little simulation of somebody smiling.

30:58.480 --> 31:01.480
 But the simulation would not be the kind of simulation I'm talking about in the simulation

31:01.480 --> 31:06.840
 argument where the simulated creature is conscious, it would just be a kind of smiley face that

31:06.840 --> 31:08.600
 would look perfectly real to you.

31:08.600 --> 31:14.720
 So we're now drawing a distinction between appear to be perfectly real and actually being

31:14.720 --> 31:15.720
 real.

31:15.720 --> 31:16.720
 Yeah.

31:16.720 --> 31:22.040
 Um, so that could be one thing, I mean, like a big impact on history, maybe is also something

31:22.040 --> 31:25.640
 you won't have if you check into this experience machine.

31:25.640 --> 31:29.880
 So some people might actually feel the life I want to have for me is one where I have

31:29.880 --> 31:35.520
 a big positive impact on history unfolds.

31:35.520 --> 31:43.560
 So you could kind of explore these different possible explanations for why it is you wouldn't

31:43.560 --> 31:48.000
 want to go into the experience machine if that's, if that's what you feel.

31:48.000 --> 31:53.320
 And one interesting observation regarding this Nozick thought experiment and the conclusions

31:53.320 --> 31:58.760
 he wanted to draw from it is how much is a kind of a status quo effect.

31:58.760 --> 32:04.800
 So a lot of people might not want to get this on current reality to plug into this dream

32:04.800 --> 32:06.160
 machine.

32:06.160 --> 32:13.240
 But if they instead were told, well, what you've experienced up to this point was a

32:13.240 --> 32:20.640
 dream now, do you want to disconnect from this and enter the real world when you have

32:20.640 --> 32:24.880
 no idea maybe what the real world is, or maybe you could say, well, you're actually a farmer

32:24.880 --> 32:32.280
 in Peru, growing, you know, peanuts, and you could live for the rest of your life in this

32:32.280 --> 32:40.480
 way, or would you want to continue your dream life as Alex Friedman going around the world

32:40.480 --> 32:44.080
 making podcasts and doing research.

32:44.080 --> 32:51.320
 So if the status quo was that they were actually in the experience machine, I think a lot of

32:51.320 --> 32:55.440
 people might then prefer to live the life that they are familiar with rather than sort

32:55.440 --> 32:57.120
 of bail out into.

32:57.120 --> 33:02.600
 So that's interesting, the change itself, the leap, yeah, so it might not be so much

33:02.600 --> 33:04.440
 the reality itself that we're after.

33:04.440 --> 33:09.000
 But it's more that we are maybe involved in certain projects and relationships.

33:09.000 --> 33:14.040
 And we have, you know, a self identity and these things that our values are kind of connected

33:14.040 --> 33:15.880
 with carrying that forward.

33:15.880 --> 33:22.760
 And then whether it's inside a tank or outside a tank in Peru, or whether inside a computer

33:22.760 --> 33:29.120
 outside a computer, that's kind of less important to what we ultimately care about.

33:29.120 --> 33:34.720
 Yeah, but still, so just to linger on it, it is interesting.

33:34.720 --> 33:39.600
 I find maybe people are different, but I find myself quite willing to take the leap to the

33:39.600 --> 33:46.800
 farmer in Peru, especially as the virtual reality system become more realistic.

33:46.800 --> 33:50.760
 I find that possibility and I think more people would take that leap.

33:50.760 --> 33:53.640
 But so in this thought experiment, just to make sure we are understanding, so in this

33:53.640 --> 34:01.280
 case, the farmer in Peru would not be a virtual reality, that would be the real, your life,

34:01.280 --> 34:04.400
 like before this whole experience machine started.

34:04.400 --> 34:09.560
 Well, I kind of assumed from that description, you're being very specific, but that kind

34:09.560 --> 34:15.320
 of idea just like washes away the concept of what's real.

34:15.320 --> 34:23.320
 I'm still a little hesitant about your kind of distinction between real and illusion.

34:23.320 --> 34:31.080
 Because when you can have an illusion that feels, I mean, that looks real, I don't know

34:31.080 --> 34:35.320
 how you can definitively say something is real or not, like what's a good way to prove

34:35.320 --> 34:37.600
 that something is real in that context?

34:37.600 --> 34:41.040
 Well, so I guess in this case, it's more a stipulation.

34:41.040 --> 34:47.400
 In one case, you're floating in a tank with these wires by the super duper neuroscientists

34:47.400 --> 34:52.440
 plugging into your head, giving you like Friedman experiences.

34:52.440 --> 34:57.120
 In the other, you're actually tilling the soil in Peru, growing peanuts, and then those

34:57.120 --> 35:01.440
 peanuts are being eaten by other people all around the world who buy the exports.

35:01.440 --> 35:08.600
 That's two different possible situations in the one and the same real world that you could

35:08.600 --> 35:09.600
 choose to occupy.

35:09.600 --> 35:15.400
 But just to be clear, when you're in a vat with wires and the neuroscientists, you can

35:15.400 --> 35:19.000
 still go farming in Peru, right?

35:19.000 --> 35:25.120
 No, well, if you wanted to, you could have the experience of farming in Peru, but there

35:25.120 --> 35:28.760
 wouldn't actually be any peanuts grown.

35:28.760 --> 35:36.560
 But what makes a peanut, so a peanut could be grown and you could feed things with that

35:36.560 --> 35:41.600
 peanut and why can't all of that be done in a simulation?

35:41.600 --> 35:45.760
 I hope, first of all, that they actually have peanut farms in Peru, I guess we'll get a

35:45.760 --> 35:50.000
 lot of comments otherwise from Angrit.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.160
 I was way up to the point when you started talking about Peru peanuts, that's when I

35:54.160 --> 35:56.200
 realized you're relying out of these.

35:56.200 --> 35:57.200
 In that climate.

35:57.200 --> 36:05.120
 No, I mean, I think, I mean, in the simulation, I think there is a sense, the important sense

36:05.120 --> 36:07.200
 in which it would all be real.

36:07.200 --> 36:13.720
 Nevertheless, there is a distinction between inside the simulation and outside the simulation.

36:13.720 --> 36:19.680
 Or in the case of Nozick's thought experiment, whether you're in the vat or outside the vat,

36:19.680 --> 36:22.440
 and some of those differences may or may not be important.

36:22.440 --> 36:25.520
 I mean, that comes down to your values and preferences.

36:25.520 --> 36:32.840
 So if the, if the experience machine only gives you the experience of growing peanuts,

36:32.840 --> 36:35.680
 but you're the only one in the experience machines.

36:35.680 --> 36:40.400
 No, but there's other, you can, within the experience machine, others can plug in.

36:40.400 --> 36:43.840
 Well, there are versions of the experience machine.

36:43.840 --> 36:47.520
 So in fact, you might want to have, distinguish different thought experiments, different versions

36:47.520 --> 36:48.520
 of it.

36:48.520 --> 36:49.520
 I see.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.840
 So in, like in the original thought experiment, maybe it's only you, right?

36:51.840 --> 36:54.480
 And you think, I wouldn't want to go in there.

36:54.480 --> 36:58.200
 Well, that tells you something interesting about what you value and what you care about.

36:58.200 --> 37:02.000
 Then you could say, well, what if you add the fact that there would be other people

37:02.000 --> 37:03.440
 in there and you would interact with them?

37:03.440 --> 37:06.920
 Well, it starts to make it more attractive, right?

37:06.920 --> 37:10.920
 Then you could add in, well, what if you could also have important longterm effects on human

37:10.920 --> 37:14.840
 history and the world, and you could actually do something useful, even though you were

37:14.840 --> 37:15.840
 in there.

37:15.840 --> 37:17.760
 That makes it maybe even more attractive.

37:17.760 --> 37:22.480
 Like you could actually have a life that had a purpose and consequences.

37:22.480 --> 37:30.760
 And so as you sort of add more into it, it becomes more similar to the baseline reality

37:30.760 --> 37:32.920
 that you were comparing it to.

37:32.920 --> 37:37.840
 Yeah, but I just think inside the experience machine and without taking those steps you

37:37.840 --> 37:45.720
 just mentioned, you still have an impact on longterm history of the creatures that live

37:45.720 --> 37:53.360
 inside that, of the quote unquote fake creatures that live inside that experience machine.

37:53.360 --> 37:59.800
 And that, like at a certain point, you know, if there's a person waiting for you inside

37:59.800 --> 38:06.920
 that experience machine, maybe your newly found wife and she dies, she has fear, she

38:06.920 --> 38:12.900
 has hopes, and she exists in that machine when you plug out, when you unplug yourself

38:12.900 --> 38:16.080
 and plug back in, she's still there going on about her life.

38:16.080 --> 38:20.640
 Well, in that case, yeah, she starts to have more of an independent existence.

38:20.640 --> 38:21.640
 Independent existence.

38:21.640 --> 38:26.680
 But it depends, I think, on how she's implemented in the experience machine.

38:26.680 --> 38:32.480
 Take one limit case where all she is is a static picture on the wall, a photograph.

38:32.480 --> 38:36.060
 So you think, well, I can look at her, right?

38:36.060 --> 38:37.240
 But that's it.

38:37.240 --> 38:38.240
 There's no...

38:38.240 --> 38:41.960
 Then you think, well, it doesn't really matter much what happens to that, any more than a

38:41.960 --> 38:45.080
 normal photograph if you tear it up, right?

38:45.080 --> 38:49.300
 It means you can't see it anymore, but you haven't harmed the person whose picture you

38:49.300 --> 38:52.300
 tore up.

38:52.300 --> 38:58.120
 But if she's actually implemented, say, at a neural level of detail so that she's a fully

38:58.120 --> 39:06.120
 realized digital mind with the same behavioral repertoire as you have, then very plausibly

39:06.120 --> 39:09.240
 she would be a conscious person like you are.

39:09.240 --> 39:14.220
 And then what you do in this experience machine would have real consequences for how this

39:14.220 --> 39:17.680
 other mind felt.

39:17.680 --> 39:21.100
 So you have to specify which of these experience machines you're talking about.

39:21.100 --> 39:27.920
 I think it's not entirely obvious that it would be possible to have an experience machine

39:27.920 --> 39:34.240
 that gave you a normal set of human experiences, which include experiences of interacting with

39:34.240 --> 39:40.560
 other people, without that also generating consciousnesses corresponding to those other

39:40.560 --> 39:41.560
 people.

39:41.560 --> 39:47.480
 That is, if you create another entity that you perceive and interact with, that to you

39:47.480 --> 39:49.320
 looks entirely realistic.

39:49.320 --> 39:53.160
 Not just when you say hello, they say hello back, but you have a rich interaction, many

39:53.160 --> 39:54.840
 days, deep conversations.

39:54.840 --> 40:00.960
 It might be that the only possible way of implementing that would be one that also has

40:00.960 --> 40:06.600
 a side effect, instantiated this other person in enough detail that you would have a second

40:06.600 --> 40:07.680
 consciousness there.

40:07.680 --> 40:11.800
 I think that's to some extent an open question.

40:11.800 --> 40:15.040
 So you don't think it's possible to fake consciousness and fake intelligence?

40:15.040 --> 40:16.040
 Well, it might be.

40:16.040 --> 40:21.340
 I mean, I think you can certainly fake, if you have a very limited interaction with somebody,

40:21.340 --> 40:24.320
 you could certainly fake that.

40:24.320 --> 40:28.320
 If all you have to go on is somebody said hello to you, that's not enough for you to

40:28.320 --> 40:34.880
 tell whether that was a real person there, or a prerecorded message, or a very superficial

40:34.880 --> 40:39.280
 simulation that has no consciousness, because that's something easy to fake.

40:39.280 --> 40:43.720
 We could already fake it, now you can record a voice recording.

40:43.720 --> 40:49.160
 But if you have a richer set of interactions where you're allowed to ask open ended questions

40:49.160 --> 40:54.920
 and probe from different angles, you couldn't give canned answer to all of the possible

40:54.920 --> 41:00.280
 ways that you could probe it, then it starts to become more plausible that the only way

41:00.280 --> 41:05.160
 to realize this thing in such a way that you would get the right answer from any which

41:05.160 --> 41:10.040
 angle you probed it, would be a way of instantiating it, where you also instantiated a conscious

41:10.040 --> 41:11.040
 mind.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.960
 Yeah, I'm with you on the intelligence part, but is there something about me that says

41:13.960 --> 41:15.960
 consciousness is easier to fake?

41:15.960 --> 41:23.080
 Like I've recently gotten my hands on a lot of rubas, don't ask me why or how.

41:23.080 --> 41:28.540
 And I've made them, there's just a nice robotic mobile platform for experiments.

41:28.540 --> 41:34.560
 And I made them scream and or moan in pain, so on, just to see when they're responding

41:34.560 --> 41:35.560
 to me.

41:35.560 --> 41:39.240
 And it's just a sort of psychological experiment on myself.

41:39.240 --> 41:43.120
 And I think they appear conscious to me pretty quickly.

41:43.120 --> 41:46.720
 To me, at least my brain can be tricked quite easily.

41:46.720 --> 41:53.760
 I said if I introspect, it's harder for me to be tricked that something is intelligent.

41:53.760 --> 41:58.860
 So I just have this feeling that inside this experience machine, just saying that you're

41:58.860 --> 42:05.000
 conscious and having certain qualities of the interaction, like being able to suffer,

42:05.000 --> 42:12.040
 like being able to hurt, like being able to wander about the essence of your own existence,

42:12.040 --> 42:18.040
 not actually, I mean, creating the illusion that you're wandering about it is enough to

42:18.040 --> 42:23.120
 create the illusion of consciousness.

42:23.120 --> 42:27.440
 And because of that, create a really immersive experience to where you feel like that is

42:27.440 --> 42:28.440
 the real world.

42:28.440 --> 42:33.260
 So you think there's a big gap between appearing conscious and being conscious?

42:33.260 --> 42:36.080
 Or is it that you think it's very easy to be conscious?

42:36.080 --> 42:38.120
 I'm not actually sure what it means to be conscious.

42:38.120 --> 42:48.200
 All I'm saying is the illusion of consciousness is enough to create a social interaction that's

42:48.200 --> 42:52.480
 as good as if the thing was conscious, meaning I'm making it about myself.

42:52.480 --> 42:53.480
 Right.

42:53.480 --> 42:54.480
 Yeah.

42:54.480 --> 42:55.480
 I mean, I guess there are a few different things.

42:55.480 --> 42:59.740
 One is how good the interaction is, which might, I mean, if you don't really care about

42:59.740 --> 43:05.080
 like probing hard for whether the thing is conscious, maybe it would be a satisfactory

43:05.080 --> 43:10.720
 interaction, whether or not you really thought it was conscious.

43:10.720 --> 43:20.040
 Now, if you really care about it being conscious in like inside this experience machine, how

43:20.040 --> 43:22.340
 easy would it be to fake it?

43:22.340 --> 43:28.000
 And you say, it sounds fairly easy, but then the question is, would that also mean it's

43:28.000 --> 43:30.600
 very easy to instantiate consciousness?

43:30.600 --> 43:35.440
 Like it's much more widely spread in the world and we have thought it doesn't require a big

43:35.440 --> 43:39.600
 human brain with a hundred billion neurons, all you need is some system that exhibits

43:39.600 --> 43:43.300
 basic intentionality and can respond and you already have consciousness.

43:43.300 --> 43:49.080
 Like in that case, I guess you still have a close coupling.

43:49.080 --> 43:54.600
 I guess that case would be where they can come apart, where you could create the appearance

43:54.600 --> 43:59.200
 of there being a conscious mind with actually not being another conscious mind.

43:59.200 --> 44:03.320
 I'm somewhat agnostic exactly where these lines go.

44:03.320 --> 44:12.280
 I think one observation that makes it plausible that you could have very realistic appearances

44:12.280 --> 44:18.320
 relatively simply, which also is relevant for the simulation argument and in terms of

44:18.320 --> 44:24.400
 thinking about how realistic would a virtual reality model have to be in order for the

44:24.400 --> 44:27.960
 simulated creature not to notice that anything was awry.

44:27.960 --> 44:33.960
 Well, just think of our own humble brains during the wee hours of the night when we

44:33.960 --> 44:35.400
 are dreaming.

44:35.400 --> 44:40.560
 Many times, well, dreams are very immersive, but often you also don't realize that you're

44:40.560 --> 44:43.440
 in a dream.

44:43.440 --> 44:51.320
 And that's produced by simple primitive three pound lumps of neural matter effortlessly.

44:51.320 --> 44:57.160
 So if a simple brain like this can create the virtual reality that seems pretty real

44:57.160 --> 45:03.120
 to us, then how much easier would it be for a super intelligent civilization with planetary

45:03.120 --> 45:09.760
 sized computers optimized over the eons to create a realistic environment for you to

45:09.760 --> 45:10.760
 interact with?

45:10.760 --> 45:11.760
 Yeah.

45:11.760 --> 45:17.720
 By the way, behind that intuition is that our brain is not that impressive relative

45:17.720 --> 45:21.280
 to the possibilities of what technology could bring.

45:21.280 --> 45:26.820
 It's also possible that the brain is the epitome, is the ceiling.

45:26.820 --> 45:30.960
 How is that possible?

45:30.960 --> 45:36.240
 Meaning like this is the smartest possible thing that the universe could create.

45:36.240 --> 45:39.800
 So that seems unlikely to me.

45:39.800 --> 45:40.800
 Yeah.

45:40.800 --> 45:47.600
 I mean, for some of these reasons we alluded to earlier in terms of designs we already

45:47.600 --> 45:54.960
 have for computers that would be faster by many orders of magnitude than the human brain.

45:54.960 --> 45:55.960
 Yeah.

45:55.960 --> 46:01.120
 We can see that the constraints, the cognitive constraints in themselves is what enables

46:01.120 --> 46:02.440
 the intelligence.

46:02.440 --> 46:09.420
 So the more powerful you make the computer, the less likely it is to become super intelligent.

46:09.420 --> 46:12.120
 This is where I say dumb things to push back on that statement.

46:12.120 --> 46:13.120
 Yeah.

46:13.120 --> 46:14.120
 I'm not sure I thought that we might.

46:14.120 --> 46:15.120
 No.

46:15.120 --> 46:18.120
 I mean, so there are different dimensions of intelligence.

46:18.120 --> 46:20.220
 A simple one is just speed.

46:20.220 --> 46:25.360
 Like if you can solve the same challenge faster in some sense, you're like smarter.

46:25.360 --> 46:31.560
 So there I think we have very strong evidence for thinking that you could have a computer

46:31.560 --> 46:37.880
 in this universe that would be much faster than the human brain and therefore have speed

46:37.880 --> 46:42.920
 super intelligence, like be completely superior, maybe a million times faster.

46:42.920 --> 46:46.960
 Then maybe there are other ways in which you could be smarter as well, maybe more qualitative

46:46.960 --> 46:48.680
 ways, right?

46:48.680 --> 46:51.840
 And the concepts are a little bit less clear cut.

46:51.840 --> 46:59.640
 So it's harder to make a very crisp, neat, firmly logical argument for why that could

46:59.640 --> 47:03.240
 be qualitative super intelligence as opposed to just things that were faster.

47:03.240 --> 47:08.040
 Although I still think it's very plausible and for various reasons that are less than

47:08.040 --> 47:09.240
 watertight arguments.

47:09.240 --> 47:14.680
 But when you can sort of, for example, if you look at animals and even within humans,

47:14.680 --> 47:19.760
 like there seems to be like Einstein versus random person, like it's not just that Einstein

47:19.760 --> 47:25.000
 was a little bit faster, but like how long would it take a normal person to invent general

47:25.000 --> 47:30.080
 relativity is like, it's not 20% longer than it took Einstein or something like that.

47:30.080 --> 47:32.920
 It's like, I don't know whether they would do it at all or it would take millions of

47:32.920 --> 47:37.320
 years or some totally bizarre.

47:37.320 --> 47:42.600
 But your intuition is that the compute size will get you go increasing the size of the

47:42.600 --> 47:49.560
 computer and the speed of the computer might create some much more powerful levels of intelligence

47:49.560 --> 47:53.560
 that would enable some of the things we've been talking about with like the simulation,

47:53.560 --> 48:00.760
 being able to simulate an ultra realistic environment, ultra realistic perception of

48:00.760 --> 48:01.760
 reality.

48:01.760 --> 48:02.760
 Yeah.

48:02.760 --> 48:05.720
 I mean, strictly speaking, it would not be necessary to have super intelligence in order

48:05.720 --> 48:14.280
 to have say the technology to make these simulations, ancestor simulations or other kinds of simulations.

48:14.280 --> 48:20.800
 As a matter of fact, I think if we are in a simulation, it would most likely be one

48:20.800 --> 48:26.280
 built by a civilization that had super intelligence.

48:26.280 --> 48:27.560
 It certainly would help a lot.

48:27.560 --> 48:31.400
 I mean, you could build more efficient larger scale structures if you had super intelligence.

48:31.400 --> 48:34.960
 I also think that if you had the technology to build these simulations, that's like a

48:34.960 --> 48:35.960
 very advanced technology.

48:35.960 --> 48:40.520
 It seems kind of easier to get the technology to super intelligence.

48:40.520 --> 48:45.280
 I'd expect by the time they could make these fully realistic simulations of human history

48:45.280 --> 48:49.160
 with human brains in there, like before that they got to that stage, they would have figured

48:49.160 --> 48:55.520
 out how to create machine super intelligence or maybe biological enhancements of their

48:55.520 --> 48:59.200
 own brains if there were biological creatures to start with.

48:59.200 --> 49:04.240
 So we talked about the three parts of the simulation argument.

49:04.240 --> 49:08.480
 One, we destroy ourselves before we ever create the simulation.

49:08.480 --> 49:13.200
 Two, we somehow, everybody somehow loses interest in creating the simulation.

49:13.200 --> 49:16.280
 Three, we're living in a simulation.

49:16.280 --> 49:21.760
 So you've kind of, I don't know if your thinking has evolved on this point, but you kind of

49:21.760 --> 49:28.320
 said that we know so little that these three cases might as well be equally probable.

49:28.320 --> 49:31.720
 So probabilistically speaking, where do you stand on this?

49:31.720 --> 49:41.280
 Yeah, I mean, I don't think equal necessarily would be the most supported probability assignment.

49:41.280 --> 49:47.280
 So how would you, without assigning actual numbers, what's more or less likely in your

49:47.280 --> 49:48.280
 view?

49:48.280 --> 49:54.600
 Well, I mean, I've historically tended to punt on the question of like between these

49:54.600 --> 49:55.600
 three.

49:55.600 --> 50:01.640
 So maybe you ask me another way is which kind of things would make each of these more or

50:01.640 --> 50:03.440
 less likely?

50:03.440 --> 50:05.200
 What kind of intuition?

50:05.200 --> 50:10.960
 Certainly in general terms, if you think anything that say increases or reduces the probability

50:10.960 --> 50:17.040
 of one of these, we tend to slosh probability around on the other.

50:17.040 --> 50:20.600
 So if one becomes less probable, like the other would have to, cause it's got to add

50:20.600 --> 50:22.000
 up to one.

50:22.000 --> 50:28.960
 So if we consider the first hypothesis, the first alternative that there's this filter

50:28.960 --> 50:39.160
 that makes it so that virtually no civilization reaches technological maturity, in particular

50:39.160 --> 50:42.440
 our own civilization, if that's true, then it's like very unlikely that we would reach

50:42.440 --> 50:47.600
 technological maturity because if almost no civilization at our stage does it, then it's

50:47.600 --> 50:49.120
 unlikely that we do it.

50:49.120 --> 50:50.120
 So hence...

50:50.120 --> 50:51.120
 Sorry, can you linger on that for a second?

50:51.120 --> 50:59.000
 Well, so if it's the case that almost all civilizations at our current stage of technological

50:59.000 --> 51:05.280
 development failed to reach maturity, that would give us very strong reason for thinking

51:05.280 --> 51:07.480
 we will fail to reach technological maturity.

51:07.480 --> 51:12.000
 Oh, and also sort of the flip side of that is the fact that we've reached it means that

51:12.000 --> 51:13.680
 many other civilizations have reached this point.

51:13.680 --> 51:14.680
 Yeah.

51:14.680 --> 51:20.200
 So that means if we get closer and closer to actually reaching technological maturity,

51:20.200 --> 51:26.200
 there's less and less distance left where we could go extinct before we are there, and

51:26.200 --> 51:31.520
 therefore the probability that we will reach increases as we get closer, and that would

51:31.520 --> 51:36.120
 make it less likely to be true that almost all civilizations at our current stage failed

51:36.120 --> 51:37.120
 to get there.

51:37.120 --> 51:38.880
 Like we would have this...

51:38.880 --> 51:42.960
 The one case we had started ourselves would be very close to getting there, that would

51:42.960 --> 51:46.440
 be strong evidence that it's not so hard to get to technological maturity.

51:46.440 --> 51:52.800
 So to the extent that we feel we are moving nearer to technological maturity, that would

51:52.800 --> 51:58.000
 tend to reduce the probability of the first alternative and increase the probability of

51:58.000 --> 51:59.600
 the other two.

51:59.600 --> 52:01.960
 It doesn't need to be a monotonic change.

52:01.960 --> 52:07.440
 Like if every once in a while some new threat comes into view, some bad new thing you could

52:07.440 --> 52:13.460
 do with some novel technology, for example, that could change our probabilities in the

52:13.460 --> 52:15.160
 other direction.

52:15.160 --> 52:20.840
 But that technology, again, you have to think about as that technology has to be able to

52:20.840 --> 52:26.400
 equally in an even way affect every civilization out there.

52:26.400 --> 52:28.120
 Yeah, pretty much.

52:28.120 --> 52:30.760
 I mean, that's strictly speaking, it's not true.

52:30.760 --> 52:36.800
 I mean, that could be two different existential risks and every civilization, you know, one

52:36.800 --> 52:42.440
 or the other, like, but none of them kills more than 50%.

52:42.440 --> 52:50.240
 But incidentally, so in some of my work, I mean, on machine superintelligence, like pointed

52:50.240 --> 52:54.440
 to some existential risks related to sort of super intelligent AI and how we must make

52:54.440 --> 52:59.820
 sure, you know, to handle that wisely and carefully.

52:59.820 --> 53:09.880
 It's not the right kind of existential catastrophe to make the first alternative true though.

53:09.880 --> 53:15.480
 Like it might be bad for us if the future lost a lot of value as a result of it being

53:15.480 --> 53:21.160
 shaped by some process that optimized for some completely nonhuman value.

53:21.160 --> 53:27.920
 But even if we got killed by machine superintelligence, that machine superintelligence might still

53:27.920 --> 53:29.520
 attain technological maturity.

53:29.520 --> 53:33.560
 Oh, I see, so you're not human exclusive.

53:33.560 --> 53:38.360
 This could be any intelligent species that achieves, like it's all about the technological

53:38.360 --> 53:39.360
 maturity.

53:39.360 --> 53:43.040
 But the humans have to attain it.

53:43.040 --> 53:44.040
 Right.

53:44.040 --> 53:47.320
 So like superintelligence could replace us and that's just as well for the simulation

53:47.320 --> 53:48.320
 argument.

53:48.320 --> 53:49.320
 Yeah, yeah.

53:49.320 --> 53:51.800
 I mean, it could interact with the second hypothesis by alternative.

53:51.800 --> 53:57.120
 Like if the thing that replaced us was either more likely or less likely than we would be

53:57.120 --> 54:02.840
 to have an interest in creating ancestor simulations, you know, that could affect probabilities.

54:02.840 --> 54:09.840
 But yeah, to a first order, like if we all just die, then yeah, we won't produce any

54:09.840 --> 54:11.920
 simulations because we are dead.

54:11.920 --> 54:17.560
 But if we all die and get replaced by some other intelligent thing that then gets to

54:17.560 --> 54:21.680
 technological maturity, the question remains, of course, if not that thing, then use some

54:21.680 --> 54:25.280
 of its resources to do this stuff.

54:25.280 --> 54:30.760
 So can you reason about this stuff, given how little we know about the universe?

54:30.760 --> 54:36.760
 Is it reasonable to reason about these probabilities?

54:36.760 --> 54:45.200
 So like how little, well, maybe you can disagree, but to me, it's not trivial to figure out

54:45.200 --> 54:47.520
 how difficult it is to build a simulation.

54:47.520 --> 54:49.640
 We kind of talked about it a little bit.

54:49.640 --> 54:56.080
 We also don't know, like as we try to start building it, like start creating virtual worlds

54:56.080 --> 54:59.640
 and so on, how that changes the fabric of society.

54:59.640 --> 55:04.560
 Like there's all these things along the way that can fundamentally change just so many

55:04.560 --> 55:09.480
 aspects of our society about our existence that we don't know anything about, like the

55:09.480 --> 55:19.380
 kind of things we might discover when we understand to a greater degree the fundamental, the physics,

55:19.380 --> 55:23.360
 like the theory, if we have a breakthrough, have a theory and everything, how that changes

55:23.360 --> 55:27.600
 stuff, how that changes deep space exploration and so on.

55:27.600 --> 55:33.040
 Like, is it still possible to reason about probabilities given how little we know?

55:33.040 --> 55:41.960
 Yes, I think there will be a large residual of uncertainty that we'll just have to acknowledge.

55:41.960 --> 55:47.880
 And I think that's true for most of these big picture questions that we might wonder

55:47.880 --> 55:49.840
 about.

55:49.840 --> 55:57.840
 It's just we are small, short lived, small brained, cognitively very limited humans with

55:57.840 --> 55:59.520
 little evidence.

55:59.520 --> 56:04.760
 And it's amazing we can figure out as much as we can really about the cosmos.

56:04.760 --> 56:10.960
 But okay, so there's this cognitive trick that seems to happen when I look at the simulation

56:10.960 --> 56:16.360
 argument, which for me, it seems like case one and two feel unlikely.

56:16.360 --> 56:22.080
 I want to say feel unlikely as opposed to sort of like, it's not like I have too much

56:22.080 --> 56:26.980
 scientific evidence to say that either one or two are not true.

56:26.980 --> 56:32.400
 It just seems unlikely that every single civilization destroys itself.

56:32.400 --> 56:37.160
 And it seems like feels unlikely that the civilizations lose interest.

56:37.160 --> 56:44.660
 So naturally, without necessarily explicitly doing it, but the simulation argument basically

56:44.660 --> 56:49.080
 says it's very likely we're living in a simulation.

56:49.080 --> 56:51.800
 To me, my mind naturally goes there.

56:51.800 --> 56:54.860
 I think the mind goes there for a lot of people.

56:54.860 --> 56:57.400
 Is that the incorrect place for it to go?

56:57.400 --> 56:59.160
 Well, not necessarily.

56:59.160 --> 57:09.040
 I think the second alternative, which has to do with the motivations and interests of

57:09.040 --> 57:15.160
 technological and material civilizations, I think there is much we don't understand about

57:15.160 --> 57:16.160
 that.

57:16.160 --> 57:18.440
 Can you talk about that a little bit?

57:18.440 --> 57:19.440
 What do you think?

57:19.440 --> 57:22.940
 I mean, this is a question that pops up when you when you build an AGI system or build

57:22.940 --> 57:26.320
 a general intelligence.

57:26.320 --> 57:27.880
 How does that change our motivations?

57:27.880 --> 57:30.800
 Do you think it'll fundamentally transform our motivations?

57:30.800 --> 57:39.280
 Well, it doesn't seem that implausible that once you take this leap to to technological

57:39.280 --> 57:44.920
 maturity, I mean, I think like it involves creating machine super intelligence, possibly

57:44.920 --> 57:50.840
 that would be sort of on the path for basically all civilizations, maybe before they are able

57:50.840 --> 57:55.840
 to create large numbers of ancestry simulations, they would that that possibly could be one

57:55.840 --> 58:03.240
 of these things that quite radically changes the orientation of what a civilization is,

58:03.240 --> 58:06.400
 in fact, optimizing for.

58:06.400 --> 58:08.760
 There are other things as well.

58:08.760 --> 58:20.240
 So at the moment, we have not perfect control over our own being our own mental states,

58:20.240 --> 58:25.240
 our own experiences are not under our direct control.

58:25.240 --> 58:33.840
 So for example, if if you want to experience a pleasure and happiness, you might have to

58:33.840 --> 58:39.720
 do a whole host of things in the external world to try to get into the stage into the

58:39.720 --> 58:44.240
 mental state where you experience pleasure, like some people get some pleasure from eating

58:44.240 --> 58:45.240
 great food.

58:45.240 --> 58:49.960
 Well, they can just turn that on, they have to kind of actually go to a nice restaurant

58:49.960 --> 58:51.400
 and then they have to make money.

58:51.400 --> 58:58.120
 So there's like all this kind of activity that maybe arises from the fact that we are

58:58.120 --> 59:02.120
 trying to ultimately produce mental states.

59:02.120 --> 59:06.560
 But the only way to do that is by a whole host of complicated activities in the external

59:06.560 --> 59:07.560
 world.

59:07.560 --> 59:11.560
 Now, at some level of technological development, I think we'll become auto potent in the sense

59:11.560 --> 59:18.920
 of gaining direct ability to choose our own internal configuration, and enough knowledge

59:18.920 --> 59:22.840
 and insight to be able to actually do that in a meaningful way.

59:22.840 --> 59:28.160
 So then it could turn out that there are a lot of instrumental goals that would drop

59:28.160 --> 59:33.420
 out of the picture and be replaced by other instrumental goals, because we could now serve

59:33.420 --> 59:37.200
 some of these final goals in more direct ways.

59:37.200 --> 59:45.500
 And who knows how all of that shakes out after civilizations reflect on that and converge

59:45.500 --> 59:49.880
 on different attractors and so on and so forth.

59:49.880 --> 59:57.040
 And that could be new instrumental considerations that come into view as well, that we are just

59:57.040 --> 1:00:04.240
 oblivious to, that would maybe have a strong shaping effect on actions, like very strong

1:00:04.240 --> 1:00:08.160
 reasons to do something or not to do something, then we just don't realize they are there

1:00:08.160 --> 1:00:11.160
 because we are so dumb, bumbling through the universe.

1:00:11.160 --> 1:00:17.680
 But if almost inevitably en route to attaining the ability to create many ancestors simulations,

1:00:17.680 --> 1:00:23.240
 you do have this cognitive enhancement, or advice from super intelligences or yourself,

1:00:23.240 --> 1:00:27.120
 then maybe there's like this additional set of considerations coming into view and it's

1:00:27.120 --> 1:00:32.000
 obvious that the thing that makes sense is to do X, whereas right now it seems you could

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:39.720
 X, Y or Z and different people will do different things and we are kind of random in that sense.

1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:45.160
 Because at this time, with our limited technology, the impact of our decisions is minor.

1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:48.440
 I mean, that's starting to change in some ways.

1:00:48.440 --> 1:00:49.440
 But…

1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:53.840
 Well, I'm not sure how it follows that the impact of our decisions is minor.

1:00:53.840 --> 1:00:55.600
 Well, it's starting to change.

1:00:55.600 --> 1:00:58.760
 I mean, I suppose 100 years ago it was minor.

1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:00.240
 It's starting to…

1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:03.520
 Well, it depends on how you view it.

1:01:03.520 --> 1:01:08.640
 What people did 100 years ago still have effects on the world today.

1:01:08.640 --> 1:01:11.920
 Oh, I see.

1:01:11.920 --> 1:01:14.600
 As a civilization in the togetherness.

1:01:14.600 --> 1:01:15.600
 Yeah.

1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:21.760
 So it might be that the greatest impact of individuals is not at technological maturity

1:01:21.760 --> 1:01:22.760
 or very far down.

1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:28.440
 It might be earlier on when there are different tracks, civilization could go down.

1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:33.280
 Maybe the population is smaller, things still haven't settled out.

1:01:33.280 --> 1:01:41.720
 If you count indirect effects, those could be bigger than the direct effects that people

1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:43.360
 have later on.

1:01:43.360 --> 1:01:46.280
 So part three of the argument says that…

1:01:46.280 --> 1:01:53.520
 So that leads us to a place where eventually somebody creates a simulation.

1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:55.520
 I think you had a conversation with Joe Rogan.

1:01:55.520 --> 1:02:01.200
 I think there's some aspect here where you got stuck a little bit.

1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:06.400
 How does that lead to we're likely living in a simulation?

1:02:06.400 --> 1:02:12.920
 So this kind of probability argument, if somebody eventually creates a simulation, why does

1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:15.980
 that mean that we're now in a simulation?

1:02:15.980 --> 1:02:22.780
 What you get to if you accept alternative three first is there would be more simulated

1:02:22.780 --> 1:02:26.440
 people with our kinds of experiences than non simulated ones.

1:02:26.440 --> 1:02:34.120
 Like if you look at the world as a whole, by the end of time as it were, you just count

1:02:34.120 --> 1:02:36.240
 it up.

1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:39.600
 That would be more simulated ones than non simulated ones.

1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:43.160
 Then there is an extra step to get from that.

1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:48.320
 If you assume that, suppose for the sake of the argument, that that's true.

1:02:48.320 --> 1:02:57.840
 How do you get from that to the statement we are probably in a simulation?

1:02:57.840 --> 1:03:05.920
 So here you're introducing an indexical statement like it's that this person right now is in

1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:06.920
 a simulation.

1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:10.880
 There are all these other people that are in simulations and some that are not in the

1:03:10.880 --> 1:03:13.520
 simulation.

1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:19.200
 But what probability should you have that you yourself is one of the simulated ones

1:03:19.200 --> 1:03:21.040
 in that setup?

1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:28.440
 So I call it the bland principle of indifference, which is that in cases like this, when you

1:03:28.440 --> 1:03:37.320
 have two sets of observers, one of which is much larger than the other and you can't from

1:03:37.320 --> 1:03:46.320
 any internal evidence you have, tell which set you belong to, you should assign a probability

1:03:46.320 --> 1:03:50.240
 that's proportional to the size of these sets.

1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:55.240
 So that if there are 10 times more simulated people with your kinds of experiences, you

1:03:55.240 --> 1:03:58.520
 would be 10 times more likely to be one of those.

1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:00.600
 Is that as intuitive as it sounds?

1:04:00.600 --> 1:04:06.000
 I mean, that seems kind of, if you don't have enough information, you should rationally

1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:10.880
 just assign the same probability as the size of the set.

1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:15.800
 It seems pretty plausible to me.

1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:17.040
 Where are the holes in this?

1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:23.800
 Is it at the very beginning, the assumption that everything stretches, you have infinite

1:04:23.800 --> 1:04:24.800
 time essentially?

1:04:24.800 --> 1:04:26.920
 You don't need infinite time.

1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:29.840
 You just need, how long does the time take?

1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:36.040
 However long it takes, I guess, for a universe to produce an intelligent civilization that

1:04:36.040 --> 1:04:40.520
 attains the technology to run some ancestry simulations.

1:04:40.520 --> 1:04:45.840
 When the first simulation is created, that stretch of time, just a little longer than

1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:48.200
 they'll all start creating simulations.

1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:52.200
 Well, I mean, there might be a difference.

1:04:52.200 --> 1:04:57.720
 If you think of there being a lot of different planets and some subset of them have life

1:04:57.720 --> 1:05:03.280
 and then some subset of those get to intelligent life and some of those maybe eventually start

1:05:03.280 --> 1:05:07.760
 creating simulations, they might get started at quite different times.

1:05:07.760 --> 1:05:13.960
 Maybe on some planet, it takes a billion years longer before you get monkeys or before you

1:05:13.960 --> 1:05:19.720
 get even bacteria than on another planet.

1:05:19.720 --> 1:05:25.000
 This might happen at different cosmological epochs.

1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:28.920
 Is there a connection here to the doomsday argument and that sampling there?

1:05:28.920 --> 1:05:36.880
 Yeah, there is a connection in that they both involve an application of anthropic reasoning

1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:41.120
 that is reasoning about these kind of indexical propositions.

1:05:41.120 --> 1:05:49.360
 But the assumption you need in the case of the simulation argument is much weaker than

1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:53.760
 the assumption you need to make the doomsday argument go through.

1:05:53.760 --> 1:05:58.640
 What is the doomsday argument and maybe you can speak to the anthropic reasoning in more

1:05:58.640 --> 1:05:59.640
 general.

1:05:59.640 --> 1:06:03.680
 Yeah, that's a big and interesting topic in its own right, anthropics, but the doomsday

1:06:03.680 --> 1:06:11.120
 argument is this really first discovered by Brandon Carter, who was a theoretical physicist

1:06:11.120 --> 1:06:15.920
 and then developed by philosopher John Leslie.

1:06:15.920 --> 1:06:21.080
 I think it might have been discovered initially in the 70s or 80s and Leslie wrote this book,

1:06:21.080 --> 1:06:23.280
 I think in 96.

1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:27.600
 And there are some other versions as well by Richard Gott, who's a physicist, but let's

1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:38.420
 focus on the Carter Leslie version where it's an argument that we have systematically underestimated

1:06:38.420 --> 1:06:44.160
 the probability that humanity will go extinct soon.

1:06:44.160 --> 1:06:49.040
 Now I should say most people probably think at the end of the day there is something wrong

1:06:49.040 --> 1:06:52.260
 with this doomsday argument that it doesn't really hold.

1:06:52.260 --> 1:06:56.280
 It's like there's something wrong with it, but it's proved hard to say exactly what is

1:06:56.280 --> 1:07:00.600
 wrong with it and different people have different accounts.

1:07:00.600 --> 1:07:06.480
 My own view is it seems inconclusive, but I can say what the argument is.

1:07:06.480 --> 1:07:08.080
 Yeah, that would be good.

1:07:08.080 --> 1:07:17.720
 So maybe it's easiest to explain via an analogy to sampling from urns.

1:07:17.720 --> 1:07:27.000
 So imagine you have two urns in front of you and they have balls in them that have numbers.

1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:30.020
 The two urns look the same, but inside one there are 10 balls.

1:07:30.020 --> 1:07:33.520
 Ball number one, two, three, up to ball number 10.

1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:41.720
 And then in the other urn you have a million balls numbered one to a million and somebody

1:07:41.720 --> 1:07:48.280
 puts one of these urns in front of you and asks you to guess what's the chance it's the

1:07:48.280 --> 1:07:53.280
 10 ball urn and you say, well, 50, 50, I can't tell which urn it is.

1:07:53.280 --> 1:07:58.360
 But then you're allowed to reach in and pick a ball at random from the urn and that's suppose

1:07:58.360 --> 1:08:02.200
 you find that it's ball number seven.

1:08:02.200 --> 1:08:05.680
 So that's strong evidence for the 10 ball hypothesis.

1:08:05.680 --> 1:08:11.240
 It's a lot more likely that you would get such a low numbered ball if there are only

1:08:11.240 --> 1:08:14.960
 10 balls in the urn, like it's in fact 10% done, right?

1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:19.680
 Then if there are a million balls, it would be very unlikely you would get number seven.

1:08:19.680 --> 1:08:27.200
 So you perform a Bayesian update and if your prior was 50, 50 that it was the 10 ball urn,

1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:31.640
 you become virtually certain after finding the random sample was seven that it's only

1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:33.320
 has 10 balls in it.

1:08:33.320 --> 1:08:37.480
 So in the case of the urns, this is uncontroversial, just elementary probability theory.

1:08:37.480 --> 1:08:43.240
 The Doomsday Argument says that you should reason in a similar way with respect to different

1:08:43.240 --> 1:08:49.680
 hypotheses about how many balls there will be in the urn of humanity as it were, how

1:08:49.680 --> 1:08:54.360
 many humans there will ever have been by the time we go extinct.

1:08:54.360 --> 1:09:00.400
 So to simplify, let's suppose we only consider two hypotheses, either maybe 200 billion humans

1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:05.800
 in total or 200 trillion humans in total.

1:09:05.800 --> 1:09:09.360
 You could fill in more hypotheses, but it doesn't change the principle here.

1:09:09.360 --> 1:09:12.200
 So it's easiest to see if we just consider these two.

1:09:12.200 --> 1:09:18.080
 So you start with some prior based on ordinary empirical ideas about threats to civilization

1:09:18.080 --> 1:09:19.080
 and so forth.

1:09:19.080 --> 1:09:23.640
 And maybe you say it's a 5% chance that we will go extinct by the time there will have

1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:28.560
 been 200 billion only, you're kind of optimistic, let's say, you think probably we'll make it

1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:31.840
 through, colonize the universe.

1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:39.240
 But then, according to this Doomsday Argument, you should take off your own birth rank as

1:09:39.240 --> 1:09:40.240
 a random sample.

1:09:40.240 --> 1:09:47.720
 So your birth rank is your sequence in the position of all humans that have ever existed.

1:09:47.720 --> 1:09:52.680
 It turns out you're about a human number of 100 billion, you know, give or take.

1:09:52.680 --> 1:09:55.440
 That's like, roughly how many people have been born before you.

1:09:55.440 --> 1:09:59.840
 That's fascinating, because I probably, we each have a number.

1:09:59.840 --> 1:10:04.120
 We would each have a number in this, I mean, obviously, the exact number would depend on

1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:09.080
 where you started counting, like which ancestors was human enough to count as human.

1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:13.120
 But those are not really important, there are relatively few of them.

1:10:13.120 --> 1:10:16.200
 So yeah, so you're roughly 100 billion.

1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:20.960
 Now, if they're only going to be 200 billion in total, that's a perfectly unremarkable

1:10:20.960 --> 1:10:21.960
 number.

1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:22.960
 You're somewhere in the middle, right?

1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:26.400
 It's a run of the mill human, completely unsurprising.

1:10:26.400 --> 1:10:32.960
 Now, if they're going to be 200 trillion, you would be remarkably early, like what are

1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:40.000
 the chances out of these 200 trillion human that you should be human number 100 billion?

1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:45.040
 That seems it would have a much lower conditional probability.

1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:50.820
 And so analogously to how in the urn case, you thought after finding this low numbered

1:10:50.820 --> 1:10:54.880
 random sample, you update it in favor of the urn having few balls.

1:10:54.880 --> 1:11:00.240
 Similarly, in this case, you should update in favor of the human species having a lower

1:11:00.240 --> 1:11:04.480
 total number of members that is doomed soon.

1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:05.960
 You said doomed soon?

1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:11.640
 Well, that would be the hypothesis in this case that it will end 100 billion.

1:11:11.640 --> 1:11:14.600
 I just like that term for that hypothesis.

1:11:14.600 --> 1:11:20.160
 So what it kind of crucially relies on, the Doomsday Argument, is the idea that you should

1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:27.480
 reason as if you were a random sample from the set of all humans that will have existed.

1:11:27.480 --> 1:11:31.000
 If you have that assumption, then I think the rest kind of follows.

1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:34.280
 The question then is, why should you make that assumption?

1:11:34.280 --> 1:11:38.880
 In fact, you know you're 100 billion, so where do you get this prior?

1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:45.280
 And then there is like a literature on that with different ways of supporting that assumption.

1:11:45.280 --> 1:11:48.200
 That's just one example of anthropic reasoning, right?

1:11:48.200 --> 1:11:53.800
 That seems to be kind of convenient when you think about humanity, when you think about

1:11:53.800 --> 1:12:00.320
 sort of even like existential threats and so on, as it seems that quite naturally that

1:12:00.320 --> 1:12:03.680
 you should assume that you're just an average case.

1:12:03.680 --> 1:12:07.840
 Yeah, that you're kind of a typical randomly sample.

1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:12.240
 Now, in the case of the Doomsday Argument, it seems to lead to what intuitively we think

1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:16.480
 is the wrong conclusion, or at least many people have this reaction that there's got

1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:19.320
 to be something fishy about this argument.

1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:25.840
 Because from very, very weak premises, it gets this very striking implication that we

1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:30.980
 have almost no chance of reaching size 200 trillion humans in the future.

1:12:30.980 --> 1:12:35.480
 And how could we possibly get there just by reflecting on when we were born?

1:12:35.480 --> 1:12:39.720
 It seems you would need sophisticated arguments about the impossibility of space colonization,

1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:40.720
 blah, blah.

1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:45.560
 So one might be tempted to reject this key assumption, I call it the self sampling assumption,

1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:50.280
 the idea that you should reason as if you're a random sample from all observers or in your

1:12:50.280 --> 1:12:52.600
 some reference class.

1:12:52.600 --> 1:12:58.920
 However, it turns out that in other domains, it looks like we need something like this

1:12:58.920 --> 1:13:04.840
 self sampling assumption to make sense of bona fide scientific inferences.

1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:09.320
 In contemporary cosmology, for example, you have these multiverse theories.

1:13:09.320 --> 1:13:14.880
 And according to a lot of those, all possible human observations are made.

1:13:14.880 --> 1:13:18.880
 So if you have a sufficiently large universe, you will have a lot of people observing all

1:13:18.880 --> 1:13:22.040
 kinds of different things.

1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:29.880
 So if you have two competing theories, say about the value of some constant, it could

1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:34.980
 be true according to both of these theories that there will be some observers observing

1:13:34.980 --> 1:13:42.160
 the value that corresponds to the other theory, because there will be some observers that

1:13:42.160 --> 1:13:47.600
 have hallucinations, so there's a local fluctuation or a statistically anomalous measurement,

1:13:47.600 --> 1:13:49.460
 these things will happen.

1:13:49.460 --> 1:13:53.320
 And if enough observers make enough different observations, there will be some that sort

1:13:53.320 --> 1:13:55.960
 of by chance make these different ones.

1:13:55.960 --> 1:14:04.280
 And so what we would want to say is, well, many more observers, a larger proportion of

1:14:04.280 --> 1:14:08.560
 the observers will observe as it were the true value.

1:14:08.560 --> 1:14:10.880
 And a few will observe the wrong value.

1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:15.400
 If we think of ourselves as a random sample, we should expect with a probability to observe

1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:20.180
 the true value and that will then allow us to conclude that the evidence we actually

1:14:20.180 --> 1:14:24.640
 have is evidence for the theories we think are supported.

1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:32.200
 It kind of then is a way of making sense of these inferences that clearly seem correct,

1:14:32.200 --> 1:14:38.480
 that we can make various observations and infer what the temperature of the cosmic background

1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:44.080
 is and the fine structure constant and all of this.

1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:49.980
 But it seems that without rolling in some assumption similar to the self sampling assumption,

1:14:49.980 --> 1:14:51.840
 this inference just doesn't go through.

1:14:51.840 --> 1:14:53.180
 And there are other examples.

1:14:53.180 --> 1:14:56.620
 So there are these scientific contexts where it looks like this kind of anthropic reasoning

1:14:56.620 --> 1:14:59.120
 is needed and makes perfect sense.

1:14:59.120 --> 1:15:02.960
 And yet, in the case of the Dupest argument, it has this weird consequence and people might

1:15:02.960 --> 1:15:05.760
 think there's something wrong with it there.

1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:14.200
 So there's then this project that would consist in trying to figure out what are the legitimate

1:15:14.200 --> 1:15:20.400
 ways of reasoning about these indexical facts when observer selection effects are in play.

1:15:20.400 --> 1:15:23.520
 In other words, developing a theory of anthropics.

1:15:23.520 --> 1:15:29.280
 And there are different views of looking at that and it's a difficult methodological area.

1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:37.920
 But to tie it back to the simulation argument, the key assumption there, this bland principle

1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:43.460
 of indifference, is much weaker than the self sampling assumption.

1:15:43.460 --> 1:15:48.220
 So if you think about, in the case of the Dupest argument, it says you should reason

1:15:48.220 --> 1:15:52.100
 as if you are a random sample from all humans that will have lived, even though in fact

1:15:52.100 --> 1:15:59.840
 you know that you are about number 100 billionth human and you're alive in the year 2020.

1:15:59.840 --> 1:16:04.240
 Whereas in the case of the simulation argument, it says that, well, if you actually have no

1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:10.240
 way of telling which one you are, then you should assign this kind of uniform probability.

1:16:10.240 --> 1:16:14.640
 Yeah, yeah, your role as the observer in the simulation argument is different, it seems

1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:15.640
 like.

1:16:15.640 --> 1:16:16.640
 Like who's the observer?

1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:19.640
 I mean, I keep assigning the individual consciousness.

1:16:19.640 --> 1:16:26.480
 But a lot of observers in the context of the simulation argument, the relevant observers

1:16:26.480 --> 1:16:33.440
 would be A, the people in original histories, and B, the people in simulations.

1:16:33.440 --> 1:16:37.520
 So this would be the class of observers that we need, I mean, they're also maybe the simulators,

1:16:37.520 --> 1:16:40.280
 but we can set those aside for this.

1:16:40.280 --> 1:16:46.160
 So the question is, given that class of observers, a small set of original history observers

1:16:46.160 --> 1:16:51.480
 and a large class of simulated observers, which one should you think is you?

1:16:51.480 --> 1:16:54.200
 Where are you amongst this set of observers?

1:16:54.200 --> 1:17:00.020
 I'm maybe having a little bit of trouble wrapping my head around the intricacies of what it

1:17:00.020 --> 1:17:08.020
 means to be an observer in this, in the different instantiations of the anthropic reasoning

1:17:08.020 --> 1:17:09.020
 cases that we mentioned.

1:17:09.020 --> 1:17:10.020
 Yeah.

1:17:10.020 --> 1:17:11.020
 I mean, does it have to be...

1:17:11.020 --> 1:17:12.020
 It's not the observer.

1:17:12.020 --> 1:17:16.560
 Yeah, I mean, it may be an easier way of putting it is just like, are you simulated, are you

1:17:16.560 --> 1:17:21.120
 not simulated, given this assumption that these two groups of people exist?

1:17:21.120 --> 1:17:22.120
 Yeah.

1:17:22.120 --> 1:17:24.040
 In the simulation case, it seems pretty straightforward.

1:17:24.040 --> 1:17:25.040
 Yeah.

1:17:25.040 --> 1:17:32.560
 So the key point is the methodological assumption you need to make to get the simulation argument

1:17:32.560 --> 1:17:38.940
 to where it wants to go is much weaker and less problematic than the methodological assumption

1:17:38.940 --> 1:17:43.000
 you need to make to get the doomsday argument to its conclusion.

1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:48.240
 Maybe the doomsday argument is sound or unsound, but you need to make a much stronger and more

1:17:48.240 --> 1:17:52.140
 controversial assumption to make it go through.

1:17:52.140 --> 1:17:58.820
 In the case of the simulation argument, I guess one maybe way intuition pumped to support

1:17:58.820 --> 1:18:05.560
 this bland principle of indifference is to consider a sequence of different cases where

1:18:05.560 --> 1:18:12.600
 the fraction of people who are simulated to non simulated approaches one.

1:18:12.600 --> 1:18:22.580
 So in the limiting case where everybody is simulated, obviously you can deduce with certainty

1:18:22.580 --> 1:18:24.920
 that you are simulated.

1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:30.980
 If everybody with your experiences is simulated and you know you've got to be one of those,

1:18:30.980 --> 1:18:36.200
 you don't need a probability at all, you just kind of logically conclude it, right?

1:18:36.200 --> 1:18:48.640
 So then as we move from a case where say 90% of everybody is simulated, 99%, 99.9%, it

1:18:48.640 --> 1:18:54.720
 should seem plausible that the probability you assign should sort of approach one certainty

1:18:54.720 --> 1:19:02.400
 as the fraction approaches the case where everybody is in a simulation.

1:19:02.400 --> 1:19:06.800
 You wouldn't expect that to be a discrete, well, if there's one non simulated person,

1:19:06.800 --> 1:19:12.520
 then it's 50, 50, but if we move that, then it's 100%, like it should kind of, there are

1:19:12.520 --> 1:19:18.300
 other arguments as well one can use to support this bland principle of indifference, but

1:19:18.300 --> 1:19:19.300
 that might be enough to.

1:19:19.300 --> 1:19:25.560
 But in general, when you start from time equals zero and go into the future, the fraction

1:19:25.560 --> 1:19:30.600
 of simulated, if it's possible to create simulated worlds, the fraction of simulated worlds will

1:19:30.600 --> 1:19:31.600
 go to one.

1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:37.800
 Well, I mean, it won't go all the way to one.

1:19:37.800 --> 1:19:43.680
 In reality, that would be some ratio, although maybe a technologically mature civilization

1:19:43.680 --> 1:19:52.040
 could run a lot of simulations using a small portion of its resources, it probably wouldn't

1:19:52.040 --> 1:19:53.160
 be able to run infinitely many.

1:19:53.160 --> 1:19:59.280
 I mean, if we take say the observed, the physics in the observed universe, if we assume that

1:19:59.280 --> 1:20:05.460
 that's also the physics at the level of the simulators, that would be limits to the amount

1:20:05.460 --> 1:20:16.120
 of information processing that any one civilization could perform in its future trajectory.

1:20:16.120 --> 1:20:20.000
 First of all, there's limited amount of matter you can get your hands off because with a

1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:25.760
 positive cosmological constant, the universe is accelerating, there's like a finite sphere

1:20:25.760 --> 1:20:28.800
 of stuff, even if you traveled with the speed of light that you could ever reach, you have

1:20:28.800 --> 1:20:31.880
 a finite amount of stuff.

1:20:31.880 --> 1:20:37.760
 And then if you think there is like a lower limit to the amount of loss you get when you

1:20:37.760 --> 1:20:42.260
 perform an erasure of a computation, or if you think, for example, just matter gradually

1:20:42.260 --> 1:20:49.200
 over cosmological timescales, decay, maybe protons decay, other things, and you radiate

1:20:49.200 --> 1:20:55.040
 out gravitational waves, like there's all kinds of seemingly unavoidable losses that

1:20:55.040 --> 1:20:56.040
 occur.

1:20:56.040 --> 1:21:04.080
 Eventually, we'll have something like a heat death of the universe or a cold death or whatever,

1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:05.080
 but yeah.

1:21:05.080 --> 1:21:11.360
 So it's finite, but of course, we don't know which, if there's many ancestral simulations,

1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:13.640
 we don't know which level we are.

1:21:13.640 --> 1:21:18.640
 So there could be, couldn't there be like an arbitrary number of simulation that spawned

1:21:18.640 --> 1:21:26.160
 ours, and those had more resources, in terms of physical universe to work with?

1:21:26.160 --> 1:21:29.360
 Sorry, what do you mean that that could be?

1:21:29.360 --> 1:21:40.280
 Sort of, okay, so if simulations spawn other simulations, it seems like each new spawn

1:21:40.280 --> 1:21:44.200
 has fewer resources to work with.

1:21:44.200 --> 1:21:50.240
 But we don't know at which step along the way we are at.

1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:58.320
 Any one observer doesn't know whether we're in level 42, or 100, or one, or is that not

1:21:58.320 --> 1:22:01.160
 matter for the resources?

1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:08.800
 I mean, it's true that there would be uncertainty as to, you could have stacked simulations,

1:22:08.800 --> 1:22:16.040
 and that could then be uncertainty as to which level we are at.

1:22:16.040 --> 1:22:24.680
 As you remarked also, all the computations performed in a simulation within the simulation

1:22:24.680 --> 1:22:28.640
 also have to be expanded at the level of the simulation.

1:22:28.640 --> 1:22:32.320
 So the computer in basement reality where all these simulations with the simulations

1:22:32.320 --> 1:22:37.320
 with the simulations are taking place, like that computer, ultimately, it's CPU or whatever

1:22:37.320 --> 1:22:40.000
 it is, like that has to power this whole tower, right?

1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:46.000
 So if there is a finite compute power in basement reality, that would impose a limit to how

1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.440
 tall this tower can be.

1:22:48.440 --> 1:22:53.920
 And if each level kind of imposes a large extra overhead, you might think maybe the

1:22:53.920 --> 1:23:00.720
 tower would not be very tall, that most people would be low down in the tower.

1:23:00.720 --> 1:23:03.120
 I love the term basement reality.

1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:09.320
 Let me ask one of the popularizers, you said there's many through this, when you look at

1:23:09.320 --> 1:23:14.640
 sort of the last few years of the simulation hypothesis, just like you said, it comes up

1:23:14.640 --> 1:23:17.680
 every once in a while, some new community discovers it and so on.

1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:22.800
 But I would say one of the biggest popularizers of this idea is Elon Musk.

1:23:22.800 --> 1:23:27.880
 Do you have any kind of intuition about what Elon thinks about when he thinks about simulation?

1:23:27.880 --> 1:23:30.000
 Why is this of such interest?

1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:34.000
 Is it all the things we've talked about, or is there some special kind of intuition about

1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:36.240
 simulation that he has?

1:23:36.240 --> 1:23:40.000
 I mean, you might have a better, I think, I mean, why it's of interest, I think it's

1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:45.200
 like seems pretty obvious why, to the extent that one thinks the argument is credible,

1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:48.720
 why it would be of interest, it would, if it's correct, tell us something very important

1:23:48.720 --> 1:23:53.280
 about the world in one way or the other, whichever of the three alternatives for a simulation

1:23:53.280 --> 1:23:58.160
 that seems like arguably one of the most fundamental discoveries, right?

1:23:58.160 --> 1:24:02.160
 Now, interestingly, in the case of someone like Elon, so there's like the standard arguments

1:24:02.160 --> 1:24:06.720
 for why you might want to take the simulation hypothesis seriously, the simulation argument,

1:24:06.720 --> 1:24:07.720
 right?

1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:12.360
 In the case that if you are actually Elon Musk, let us say, there's a kind of an additional

1:24:12.360 --> 1:24:17.280
 reason in that what are the chances you would be Elon Musk?

1:24:17.280 --> 1:24:24.400
 It seems like maybe there would be more interest in simulating the lives of very unusual and

1:24:24.400 --> 1:24:26.280
 remarkable people.

1:24:26.280 --> 1:24:32.440
 So if you consider not just simulations where all of human history or the whole of human

1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:37.880
 civilization are simulated, but also other kinds of simulations, which only include some

1:24:37.880 --> 1:24:44.200
 subset of people, like in those simulations that only include a subset, it might be more

1:24:44.200 --> 1:24:49.080
 likely that they would include subsets of people with unusually interesting or consequential

1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:50.080
 lives.

1:24:50.080 --> 1:24:54.320
 So if you're Elon Musk, it's more likely that you're an inspiration.

1:24:54.320 --> 1:25:00.560
 Like if you're Donald Trump, or if you're Bill Gates, or you're like, some particularly

1:25:00.560 --> 1:25:06.200
 like distinctive character, you might think that that, I mean, if you just think of yourself

1:25:06.200 --> 1:25:11.400
 into the shoes, right, it's got to be like an extra reason to think that's kind of.

1:25:11.400 --> 1:25:12.400
 So interesting.

1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:19.200
 So on a scale of like farmer in Peru to Elon Musk, the more you get towards the Elon Musk,

1:25:19.200 --> 1:25:20.200
 the higher the probability.

1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:25.280
 You'd imagine that would be some extra boost from that.

1:25:25.280 --> 1:25:26.280
 There's an extra boost.

1:25:26.280 --> 1:25:32.520
 So he also asked the question of what he would ask an AGI saying, the question being, what's

1:25:32.520 --> 1:25:34.680
 outside the simulation?

1:25:34.680 --> 1:25:37.740
 Do you think about the answer to this question?

1:25:37.740 --> 1:25:41.520
 If we are living in a simulation, what is outside the simulation?

1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:44.520
 So the programmer of the simulation?

1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:49.760
 Yeah, I mean, I think it connects to the question of what's inside the simulation in that.

1:25:49.760 --> 1:25:56.920
 So if you had views about the creators of the simulation, it might help you make predictions

1:25:56.920 --> 1:26:03.480
 about what kind of simulation it is, what might happen, what happens after the simulation,

1:26:03.480 --> 1:26:06.640
 if there is some after, but also like the kind of setup.

1:26:06.640 --> 1:26:12.000
 So these two questions would be quite closely intertwined.

1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:17.920
 But do you think it would be very surprising to like, is the stuff inside the simulation,

1:26:17.920 --> 1:26:21.520
 is it possible for it to be fundamentally different than the stuff outside?

1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:22.520
 Yeah.

1:26:22.520 --> 1:26:29.520
 Like, another way to put it, can the creatures inside the simulation be smart enough to even

1:26:29.520 --> 1:26:34.640
 understand or have the cognitive capabilities or any kind of information processing capabilities

1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:40.520
 enough to understand the mechanism that created them?

1:26:40.520 --> 1:26:43.160
 They might understand some aspects of it.

1:26:43.160 --> 1:26:50.120
 I mean, it's a level of, it's kind of, there are levels of explanation, like degrees to

1:26:50.120 --> 1:26:51.120
 which you can understand.

1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:53.840
 So does your dog understand what it is to be human?

1:26:53.840 --> 1:26:58.120
 Well, it's got some idea, like humans are these physical objects that move around and

1:26:58.120 --> 1:26:59.880
 do things.

1:26:59.880 --> 1:27:05.720
 And a normal human would have a deeper understanding of what it is to be a human.

1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:12.120
 And maybe some very experienced psychologist or great novelist might understand a little

1:27:12.120 --> 1:27:14.280
 bit more about what it is to be human.

1:27:14.280 --> 1:27:18.760
 And maybe superintelligence could see right through your soul.

1:27:18.760 --> 1:27:27.080
 So similarly, I do think that we are quite limited in our ability to understand all of

1:27:27.080 --> 1:27:31.880
 the relevant aspects of the larger context that we exist in.

1:27:31.880 --> 1:27:33.400
 But there might be hope for some.

1:27:33.400 --> 1:27:36.080
 I think we understand some aspects of it.

1:27:36.080 --> 1:27:38.320
 But you know, how much good is that?

1:27:38.320 --> 1:27:44.640
 If there's like one key aspect that changes the significance of all the other aspects.

1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:51.800
 So we understand maybe seven out of 10 key insights that you need.

1:27:51.800 --> 1:27:57.760
 But the answer actually, like varies completely depending on what like number eight, nine

1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:00.200
 and 10 insight is.

1:28:00.200 --> 1:28:07.040
 It's like whether you want to suppose that the big task were to guess whether a certain

1:28:07.040 --> 1:28:12.280
 number was odd or even, like a 10 digit number.

1:28:12.280 --> 1:28:16.440
 And if it's even, the best thing for you to do in life is to go north.

1:28:16.440 --> 1:28:21.060
 And if it's odd, the best thing for you is to go south.

1:28:21.060 --> 1:28:25.000
 Now we are in a situation where maybe through our science and philosophy, we figured out

1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:26.680
 what the first seven digits are.

1:28:26.680 --> 1:28:28.680
 So we have a lot of information, right?

1:28:28.680 --> 1:28:31.040
 Most of it we figured out.

1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:34.320
 But we are clueless about what the last three digits are.

1:28:34.320 --> 1:28:38.720
 So we are still completely clueless about whether the number is odd or even and therefore

1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:41.120
 whether we should go north or go south.

1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:45.760
 I feel that's an analogy, but I feel we're somewhat in that predicament.

1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:48.460
 We know a lot about the universe.

1:28:48.460 --> 1:28:52.640
 We've come maybe more than half of the way there to kind of fully understanding it.

1:28:52.640 --> 1:28:58.680
 But the parts we're missing are plausibly ones that could completely change the overall

1:28:58.680 --> 1:29:04.800
 upshot of the thing and including change our overall view about what the scheme of priorities

1:29:04.800 --> 1:29:07.680
 should be or which strategic direction would make sense to pursue.

1:29:07.680 --> 1:29:08.680
 Yeah.

1:29:08.680 --> 1:29:15.520
 I think your analogy of us being the dog trying to understand human beings is an entertaining

1:29:15.520 --> 1:29:17.600
 one, and probably correct.

1:29:17.600 --> 1:29:24.960
 The closer the understanding tends from the dog's viewpoint to us human psychologist viewpoint,

1:29:24.960 --> 1:29:29.880
 the steps along the way there will have completely transformative ideas of what it means to be

1:29:29.880 --> 1:29:30.880
 human.

1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:33.920
 So the dog has a very shallow understanding.

1:29:33.920 --> 1:29:39.800
 It's interesting to think that, to analogize that a dog's understanding of a human being

1:29:39.800 --> 1:29:45.880
 is the same as our current understanding of the fundamental laws of physics in the universe.

1:29:45.880 --> 1:29:47.880
 Oh man.

1:29:47.880 --> 1:29:48.880
 Okay.

1:29:48.880 --> 1:29:51.560
 We spent an hour and 40 minutes talking about the simulation.

1:29:51.560 --> 1:29:53.120
 I like it.

1:29:53.120 --> 1:29:54.360
 Let's talk about super intelligence.

1:29:54.360 --> 1:29:57.120
 At least for a little bit.

1:29:57.120 --> 1:29:58.720
 And let's start at the basics.

1:29:58.720 --> 1:30:00.720
 What to you is intelligence?

1:30:00.720 --> 1:30:01.720
 Yeah.

1:30:01.720 --> 1:30:05.960
 I tend not to get too stuck with the definitional question.

1:30:05.960 --> 1:30:11.400
 I mean, the common sense to understand, like the ability to solve complex problems, to

1:30:11.400 --> 1:30:18.600
 learn from experience, to plan, to reason, some combination of things like that.

1:30:18.600 --> 1:30:21.160
 Is consciousness mixed up into that or no?

1:30:21.160 --> 1:30:23.200
 Is consciousness mixed up into that?

1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:31.000
 Well, I think it could be fairly intelligent at least without being conscious probably.

1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:33.920
 So then what is super intelligence?

1:30:33.920 --> 1:30:40.120
 That would be like something that was much more, had much more general cognitive capacity

1:30:40.120 --> 1:30:41.760
 than we humans have.

1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:48.640
 So if we talk about general super intelligence, it would be much faster learner be able to

1:30:48.640 --> 1:30:53.520
 reason much better, make plans that are more effective at achieving its goals, say in a

1:30:53.520 --> 1:30:57.000
 wide range of complex challenging environments.

1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:03.040
 In terms of as we turn our eye to the idea of sort of existential threats from super

1:31:03.040 --> 1:31:08.920
 intelligence, do you think super intelligence has to exist in the physical world or can

1:31:08.920 --> 1:31:10.880
 it be digital only?

1:31:10.880 --> 1:31:17.920
 Sort of we think of our general intelligence as us humans, as an intelligence that's associated

1:31:17.920 --> 1:31:22.040
 with the body, that's able to interact with the world, that's able to affect the world

1:31:22.040 --> 1:31:23.360
 directly with physically.

1:31:23.360 --> 1:31:26.200
 I mean, digital only is perfectly fine, I think.

1:31:26.200 --> 1:31:31.320
 I mean, you could, it's physical in the sense that obviously the computers and the memories

1:31:31.320 --> 1:31:32.320
 are physical.

1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:34.960
 But it's capability to affect the world sort of.

1:31:34.960 --> 1:31:42.160
 Could be very strong, even if it has a limited set of actuators, if it can type text on the

1:31:42.160 --> 1:31:45.860
 screen or something like that, that would be, I think, ample.

1:31:45.860 --> 1:31:52.960
 So in terms of the concerns of existential threat of AI, how can an AI system that's

1:31:52.960 --> 1:32:00.800
 in the digital world have existential risk, sort of, and what are the attack vectors for

1:32:00.800 --> 1:32:01.800
 a digital system?

1:32:01.800 --> 1:32:07.800
 Well, I mean, I guess maybe to take one step back, so I should emphasize that I also think

1:32:07.800 --> 1:32:13.440
 there's this huge positive potential from machine intelligence, including super intelligence.

1:32:13.440 --> 1:32:20.920
 And I want to stress that because some of my writing has focused on what can go wrong.

1:32:20.920 --> 1:32:27.020
 And when I wrote the book Superintelligence, at that point, I felt that there was a kind

1:32:27.020 --> 1:32:34.300
 of neglect of what would happen if AI succeeds, and in particular, a need to get a more granular

1:32:34.300 --> 1:32:38.680
 understanding of where the pitfalls are so we can avoid them.

1:32:38.680 --> 1:32:45.560
 I think that since the book came out in 2014, there has been a much wider recognition of

1:32:45.560 --> 1:32:46.560
 that.

1:32:46.560 --> 1:32:51.620
 And a number of research groups are now actually working on developing, say, AI alignment techniques

1:32:51.620 --> 1:32:52.620
 and so on and so forth.

1:32:52.620 --> 1:33:01.740
 So yeah, I think now it's important to make sure we bring back onto the table the upside

1:33:01.740 --> 1:33:02.740
 as well.

1:33:02.740 --> 1:33:07.060
 And there's a little bit of a neglect now on the upside, which is, I mean, if you look

1:33:07.060 --> 1:33:11.780
 at, I was talking to a friend, if you look at the amount of information that is available,

1:33:11.780 --> 1:33:16.180
 or people talking and people being excited about the positive possibilities of general

1:33:16.180 --> 1:33:23.860
 intelligence, that's not, it's far outnumbered by the negative possibilities in terms of

1:33:23.860 --> 1:33:25.140
 our public discourse.

1:33:25.140 --> 1:33:26.140
 Possibly, yeah.

1:33:26.140 --> 1:33:28.280
 It's hard to measure.

1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:33.560
 But what are, can you linger on that for a little bit, what are some, to you, possible

1:33:33.560 --> 1:33:37.700
 big positive impacts of general intelligence?

1:33:37.700 --> 1:33:38.700
 Super intelligence?

1:33:38.700 --> 1:33:43.200
 Well, I mean, super intelligence, because I tend to also want to distinguish these two

1:33:43.200 --> 1:33:48.900
 different contexts of thinking about AI and AI impacts, the kind of near term and long

1:33:48.900 --> 1:33:54.680
 term, if you want, both of which I think are legitimate things to think about, and people

1:33:54.680 --> 1:34:02.020
 should discuss both of them, but they are different and they often get mixed up.

1:34:02.020 --> 1:34:06.680
 And then, then I get, you get confusion, like, I think you get simultaneously like maybe

1:34:06.680 --> 1:34:10.220
 an overhyping of the near term and then under hyping of the long term.

1:34:10.220 --> 1:34:15.260
 And so I think as long as we keep them apart, we can have like, two good conversations,

1:34:15.260 --> 1:34:18.660
 but or we can mix them together and have one bad conversation.

1:34:18.660 --> 1:34:22.820
 Can you clarify just the two things we were talking about, the near term and the long

1:34:22.820 --> 1:34:23.820
 term?

1:34:23.820 --> 1:34:24.820
 Yeah.

1:34:24.820 --> 1:34:25.820
 And what are the distinctions?

1:34:25.820 --> 1:34:28.100
 Well, it's a, it's a blurry distinction.

1:34:28.100 --> 1:34:34.940
 But say the things I wrote about in this book, super intelligence, long term, things people

1:34:34.940 --> 1:34:41.540
 are worrying about today with, I don't know, algorithmic discrimination, or even things,

1:34:41.540 --> 1:34:47.100
 self driving cars and drones and stuff, more near term.

1:34:47.100 --> 1:34:51.340
 And then of course, you could imagine some medium term where they kind of overlap and

1:34:51.340 --> 1:34:55.180
 they one evolves into the other.

1:34:55.180 --> 1:35:00.020
 But at any rate, I think both, yeah, the issues look kind of somewhat different depending

1:35:00.020 --> 1:35:01.600
 on which of these contexts.

1:35:01.600 --> 1:35:10.340
 So I think, I think it'd be nice if we can talk about the long term and think about a

1:35:10.340 --> 1:35:17.820
 positive impact or a better world because of the existence of the long term super intelligence.

1:35:17.820 --> 1:35:19.420
 Do you have views of such a world?

1:35:19.420 --> 1:35:20.420
 Yeah.

1:35:20.420 --> 1:35:24.780
 I mean, I guess it's a little hard to articulate because it seems obvious that the world has

1:35:24.780 --> 1:35:29.700
 a lot of problems as it currently stands.

1:35:29.700 --> 1:35:36.620
 And it's hard to think of any one of those, which it wouldn't be useful to have like a

1:35:36.620 --> 1:35:40.720
 friendly aligned super intelligence working on.

1:35:40.720 --> 1:35:48.300
 So from health to the economic system to be able to sort of improve the investment and

1:35:48.300 --> 1:35:52.180
 trade and foreign policy decisions, all that kind of stuff.

1:35:52.180 --> 1:35:56.300
 All that kind of stuff and a lot more.

1:35:56.300 --> 1:35:57.780
 I mean, what's the killer app?

1:35:57.780 --> 1:35:59.540
 Well, I don't think there is one.

1:35:59.540 --> 1:36:05.900
 I think AI, especially artificial general intelligence is really the ultimate general

1:36:05.900 --> 1:36:07.820
 purpose technology.

1:36:07.820 --> 1:36:12.220
 So it's not that there is this one problem, this one area where it will have a big impact.

1:36:12.220 --> 1:36:18.980
 But if and when it succeeds, it will really apply across the board in all fields where

1:36:18.980 --> 1:36:23.820
 human creativity and intelligence and problem solving is useful, which is pretty much all

1:36:23.820 --> 1:36:24.820
 fields.

1:36:24.820 --> 1:36:25.820
 Right.

1:36:25.820 --> 1:36:30.840
 The thing that it would do is give us a lot more control over nature.

1:36:30.840 --> 1:36:37.220
 It wouldn't automatically solve the problems that arise from conflict between humans, fundamentally

1:36:37.220 --> 1:36:38.220
 political problems.

1:36:38.220 --> 1:36:42.180
 Some subset of those might go away if you just had more resources and cooler tech.

1:36:42.180 --> 1:36:50.360
 But some subset would require coordination that is not automatically achieved just by

1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:53.240
 having more technological capability.

1:36:53.240 --> 1:36:59.500
 But anything that's not of that sort, I think you just get an enormous boost with this kind

1:36:59.500 --> 1:37:02.940
 of cognitive technology once it goes all the way.

1:37:02.940 --> 1:37:10.460
 Now, again, that doesn't mean I'm thinking, oh, people don't recognize what's possible

1:37:10.460 --> 1:37:14.180
 with current technology and like sometimes things get overhyped.

1:37:14.180 --> 1:37:16.940
 But I mean, those are perfectly consistent views to hold.

1:37:16.940 --> 1:37:19.940
 The ultimate potential being enormous.

1:37:19.940 --> 1:37:23.780
 And then it's a very different question of how far are we from that or what can we do

1:37:23.780 --> 1:37:25.060
 with near term technology?

1:37:25.060 --> 1:37:26.060
 Yeah.

1:37:26.060 --> 1:37:29.220
 So what's your intuition about the idea of intelligence explosion?

1:37:29.220 --> 1:37:34.920
 So there's this, you know, when you start to think about that leap from the near term

1:37:34.920 --> 1:37:40.120
 to the long term, the natural inclination, like for me, sort of building machine learning

1:37:40.120 --> 1:37:45.180
 systems today, it seems like it's a lot of work to get the general intelligence, but

1:37:45.180 --> 1:37:49.380
 there's some intuition of exponential growth of exponential improvement of intelligence

1:37:49.380 --> 1:37:50.380
 explosion.

1:37:50.380 --> 1:38:00.860
 Can you maybe try to elucidate, try to talk about what's your intuition about the possibility

1:38:00.860 --> 1:38:05.500
 of an intelligence explosion, that it won't be this gradual slow process, there might

1:38:05.500 --> 1:38:07.900
 be a phase shift?

1:38:07.900 --> 1:38:13.500
 Yeah, I think it's, we don't know how explosive it will be.

1:38:13.500 --> 1:38:19.420
 I think for what it's worth, it seems fairly likely to me that at some point, there will

1:38:19.420 --> 1:38:24.540
 be some intelligence explosion, like some period of time, where progress in AI becomes

1:38:24.540 --> 1:38:32.220
 extremely rapid, roughly, roughly in the area where you might say it's kind of humanish

1:38:32.220 --> 1:38:40.600
 equivalent in core cognitive faculties, that the concept of human equivalent starts to

1:38:40.600 --> 1:38:43.260
 break down when you look too closely at it.

1:38:43.260 --> 1:38:48.300
 And just how explosive does something have to be for it to be called an intelligence

1:38:48.300 --> 1:38:49.300
 explosion?

1:38:49.300 --> 1:38:54.460
 Like, does it have to be like overnight, literally, or a few years?

1:38:54.460 --> 1:39:00.420
 But overall, I guess, if you plotted the opinions of different people in the world, I guess

1:39:00.420 --> 1:39:06.100
 that would be somewhat more probability towards the intelligence explosion scenario than probably

1:39:06.100 --> 1:39:09.620
 the average, you know, AI researcher, I guess.

1:39:09.620 --> 1:39:14.620
 So and then the other part of the intelligence explosion, or just forget explosion, just

1:39:14.620 --> 1:39:21.540
 progress is once you achieve that gray area of human level intelligence, is it obvious

1:39:21.540 --> 1:39:26.780
 to you that we should be able to proceed beyond it to get to super intelligence?

1:39:26.780 --> 1:39:33.580
 Yeah, that seems, I mean, as much as any of these things can be obvious, given we've never

1:39:33.580 --> 1:39:39.380
 had one, people have different views, smart people have different views, it's like some

1:39:39.380 --> 1:39:44.860
 degree of uncertainty that always remains for any big, futuristic, philosophical grand

1:39:44.860 --> 1:39:49.660
 question that just we realize humans are fallible, especially about these things.

1:39:49.660 --> 1:39:55.460
 But it does seem, as far as I'm judging things based on my own impressions, that it seems

1:39:55.460 --> 1:40:04.340
 very unlikely that that would be a ceiling at or near human cognitive capacity.

1:40:04.340 --> 1:40:10.260
 And that's such a, I don't know, that's such a special moment, it's both terrifying and

1:40:10.260 --> 1:40:15.020
 exciting to create a system that's beyond our intelligence.

1:40:15.020 --> 1:40:22.140
 So maybe you can step back and say, like, how does that possibility make you feel that

1:40:22.140 --> 1:40:28.700
 we can create something, it feels like there's a line beyond which it steps, it'll be able

1:40:28.700 --> 1:40:31.180
 to outsmart you.

1:40:31.180 --> 1:40:35.060
 And therefore, it feels like a step where we lose control.

1:40:35.060 --> 1:40:42.080
 Well, I don't think the latter follows that is you could imagine.

1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:46.500
 And in fact, this is what a number of people are working towards making sure that we could

1:40:46.500 --> 1:40:53.060
 ultimately project higher levels of problem solving ability while still making sure that

1:40:53.060 --> 1:40:58.620
 they are aligned, like they are in the service of human values.

1:40:58.620 --> 1:41:06.300
 I mean, so losing control, I think, is not a given that that would happen.

1:41:06.300 --> 1:41:10.060
 Now you asked how it makes me feel, I mean, to some extent, I've lived with this for so

1:41:10.060 --> 1:41:16.820
 long, since as long as I can remember, being an adult or even a teenager, it seemed to

1:41:16.820 --> 1:41:19.780
 me obvious that at some point, AI will succeed.

1:41:19.780 --> 1:41:27.020
 And so I actually misspoke, I didn't mean control, I meant, because the control problem

1:41:27.020 --> 1:41:28.020
 is an interesting thing.

1:41:28.020 --> 1:41:33.820
 And I think the hope is, at least we should be able to maintain control over systems that

1:41:33.820 --> 1:41:35.500
 are smarter than us.

1:41:35.500 --> 1:41:46.460
 But we do lose our specialness, it sort of will lose our place as the smartest, coolest

1:41:46.460 --> 1:41:48.700
 thing on earth.

1:41:48.700 --> 1:41:55.700
 And there's an ego involved with that, that humans aren't very good at dealing with.

1:41:55.700 --> 1:41:59.860
 I mean, I value my intelligence as a human being.

1:41:59.860 --> 1:42:04.740
 It seems like a big transformative step to realize there's something out there that's

1:42:04.740 --> 1:42:05.740
 more intelligent.

1:42:05.740 --> 1:42:09.580
 I mean, you don't see that as such a fundamentally...

1:42:09.580 --> 1:42:14.300
 I think yes, a lot, I think it would be small, because I mean, I think there are already

1:42:14.300 --> 1:42:18.980
 a lot of things out there that are, I mean, certainly, if you think the universe is big,

1:42:18.980 --> 1:42:23.140
 there's going to be other civilizations that already have super intelligences, or that

1:42:23.140 --> 1:42:29.240
 just naturally have brains the size of beach balls and are like, completely leaving us

1:42:29.240 --> 1:42:30.900
 in the dust.

1:42:30.900 --> 1:42:33.540
 And we haven't come face to face with them.

1:42:33.540 --> 1:42:34.820
 We haven't come face to face.

1:42:34.820 --> 1:42:41.900
 But I mean, that's an open question, what would happen in a kind of post human world?

1:42:41.900 --> 1:42:49.300
 Like how much day to day would these super intelligences be involved in the lives of

1:42:49.300 --> 1:42:50.300
 ordinary?

1:42:50.300 --> 1:42:54.420
 I mean, you could imagine some scenario where it would be more like a background thing that

1:42:54.420 --> 1:42:58.980
 would help protect against some things, but you wouldn't like that, they wouldn't be this

1:42:58.980 --> 1:43:04.620
 intrusive kind of, like making you feel bad by like, making clever jokes on your expert,

1:43:04.620 --> 1:43:09.180
 like there's like all sorts of things that maybe in the human context would feel awkward

1:43:09.180 --> 1:43:10.180
 about that.

1:43:10.180 --> 1:43:14.500
 You don't want to be the dumbest kid in your class, everybody picks it, like, a lot of

1:43:14.500 --> 1:43:19.380
 those things, maybe you need to abstract away from, if you're thinking about this context

1:43:19.380 --> 1:43:26.260
 where we have infrastructure that is in some sense, beyond any or all humans.

1:43:26.260 --> 1:43:30.780
 I mean, it's a little bit like, say, the scientific community as a whole, if you think of that

1:43:30.780 --> 1:43:33.420
 as a mind, it's a little bit of a metaphor.

1:43:33.420 --> 1:43:39.500
 But I mean, obviously, it's got to be like, way more capacious than any individual.

1:43:39.500 --> 1:43:44.620
 So in some sense, there is this mind like thing already out there that's just vastly

1:43:44.620 --> 1:43:49.760
 more intelligent than any individual is.

1:43:49.760 --> 1:43:55.380
 And we think, okay, that's, you just accept that as a fact.

1:43:55.380 --> 1:43:59.260
 That's the basic fabric of our existence is there's super intelligent.

1:43:59.260 --> 1:44:06.020
 You get used to a lot of, I mean, there's already Google and Twitter and Facebook, these

1:44:06.020 --> 1:44:13.220
 recommender systems that are the basic fabric of our, I could see them becoming, I mean,

1:44:13.220 --> 1:44:17.480
 do you think of the collective intelligence of these systems as already perhaps reaching

1:44:17.480 --> 1:44:19.260
 super intelligence level?

1:44:19.260 --> 1:44:26.260
 Well, I mean, so here it comes to the concept of intelligence and the scale and what human

1:44:26.260 --> 1:44:29.700
 level means.

1:44:29.700 --> 1:44:37.820
 The kind of vagueness and indeterminacy of those concepts starts to dominate how you

1:44:37.820 --> 1:44:38.900
 would answer that question.

1:44:38.900 --> 1:44:45.020
 So like, say the Google search engine has a very high capacity of a certain kind, like

1:44:45.020 --> 1:44:54.940
 retrieving, remembering and retrieving information, particularly like text or images that are,

1:44:54.940 --> 1:45:02.980
 you have a kind of string, a word string key, obviously superhuman at that, but a vast set

1:45:02.980 --> 1:45:06.260
 of other things it can't even do at all.

1:45:06.260 --> 1:45:12.780
 Not just not do well, but so you have these current AI systems that are superhuman in

1:45:12.780 --> 1:45:19.300
 some limited domain and then like radically subhuman in all other domains.

1:45:19.300 --> 1:45:23.900
 Same with a chess, like are just a simple computer that can multiply really large numbers,

1:45:23.900 --> 1:45:24.900
 right?

1:45:24.900 --> 1:45:28.060
 So it's going to have this like one spike of super intelligence and then a kind of a

1:45:28.060 --> 1:45:32.300
 zero level of capability across all other cognitive fields.

1:45:32.300 --> 1:45:37.340
 Yeah, I don't necessarily think the generalness, I mean, I'm not so attached with it, but I

1:45:37.340 --> 1:45:44.340
 think it's sort of, it's a gray area and it's a feeling, but to me sort of alpha zero is

1:45:44.340 --> 1:45:51.620
 somehow much more intelligent, much, much more intelligent than Deep Blue.

1:45:51.620 --> 1:45:55.380
 And to say which domain, you could say, well, these are both just board games, they're both

1:45:55.380 --> 1:45:59.380
 just able to play board games, who cares if they're going to do better or not, but there's

1:45:59.380 --> 1:46:06.120
 something about the learning, the self play that makes it, crosses over into that land

1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:09.460
 of intelligence that doesn't necessarily need to be general.

1:46:09.460 --> 1:46:14.180
 In the same way, Google is much closer to Deep Blue currently in terms of its search

1:46:14.180 --> 1:46:17.900
 engine than it is to sort of the alpha zero.

1:46:17.900 --> 1:46:22.860
 And the moment it becomes, the moment these recommender systems really become more like

1:46:22.860 --> 1:46:29.820
 alpha zero, but being able to learn a lot without the constraints of being heavily constrained

1:46:29.820 --> 1:46:34.100
 by human interaction, that seems like a special moment in time.

1:46:34.100 --> 1:46:43.140
 I mean, certainly learning ability seems to be an important facet of general intelligence,

1:46:43.140 --> 1:46:48.200
 that you can take some new domain that you haven't seen before and you weren't specifically

1:46:48.200 --> 1:46:52.340
 pre programmed for, and then figure out what's going on there and eventually become really

1:46:52.340 --> 1:46:53.520
 good at it.

1:46:53.520 --> 1:47:00.140
 So that's something alpha zero has much more of than Deep Blue had.

1:47:00.140 --> 1:47:06.340
 And in fact, I mean, systems like alpha zero can learn not just Go, but other, in fact,

1:47:06.340 --> 1:47:09.460
 probably beat Deep Blue in chess and so forth.

1:47:09.460 --> 1:47:13.700
 So you do see this as general and it matches the intuition.

1:47:13.700 --> 1:47:17.640
 We feel it's more intelligent and it also has more of this general purpose learning

1:47:17.640 --> 1:47:20.100
 ability.

1:47:20.100 --> 1:47:23.060
 And if we get systems that have even more general purpose learning ability, it might

1:47:23.060 --> 1:47:28.100
 also trigger an even stronger intuition that they are actually starting to get smart.

1:47:28.100 --> 1:47:33.980
 So if you were to pick a future, what do you think a utopia looks like with AGI systems?

1:47:33.980 --> 1:47:40.540
 Sort of, is it the neural link brain computer interface world where we're kind of really

1:47:40.540 --> 1:47:43.780
 closely interlinked with AI systems?

1:47:43.780 --> 1:47:50.900
 Is it possibly where AGI systems replace us completely while maintaining the values and

1:47:50.900 --> 1:47:53.500
 the consciousness?

1:47:53.500 --> 1:47:57.460
 Is it something like it's a completely invisible fabric, like you mentioned, a society where

1:47:57.460 --> 1:48:02.180
 just aids and a lot of stuff that we do like curing diseases and so on.

1:48:02.180 --> 1:48:03.980
 What is utopia if you get to pick?

1:48:03.980 --> 1:48:09.020
 Yeah, I mean, it is a good question and a deep and difficult one.

1:48:09.020 --> 1:48:10.300
 I'm quite interested in it.

1:48:10.300 --> 1:48:15.180
 I don't have all the answers yet, but I might never have.

1:48:15.180 --> 1:48:19.660
 But I think there are some different observations one can make.

1:48:19.660 --> 1:48:26.180
 One is if this scenario actually did come to pass, it would open up this vast space

1:48:26.180 --> 1:48:30.500
 of possible modes of being.

1:48:30.500 --> 1:48:36.260
 On one hand, material and resource constraints would just be like expanded dramatically.

1:48:36.260 --> 1:48:41.900
 So there would be a lot of a big pie, let's say.

1:48:41.900 --> 1:48:51.940
 Also it would enable us to do things, including to ourselves, it would just open up this much

1:48:51.940 --> 1:48:59.100
 larger design space and option space than we have ever had access to in human history.

1:48:59.100 --> 1:49:01.140
 I think two things follow from that.

1:49:01.140 --> 1:49:08.420
 One is that we probably would need to make a fairly fundamental rethink of what ultimately

1:49:08.420 --> 1:49:11.940
 we value, like think things through more from first principles.

1:49:11.940 --> 1:49:15.140
 The context would be so different from the familiar that we could have just take what

1:49:15.140 --> 1:49:21.260
 we've always been doing and then like, oh, well, we have this cleaning robot that cleans

1:49:21.260 --> 1:49:24.780
 the dishes in the sink and a few other small things.

1:49:24.780 --> 1:49:27.100
 I think we would have to go back to first principles.

1:49:27.100 --> 1:49:31.560
 So even from the individual level, go back to the first principles of what is the meaning

1:49:31.560 --> 1:49:35.540
 of life, what is happiness, what is fulfillment.

1:49:35.540 --> 1:49:43.300
 And then also connected to this large space of resources is that it would be possible.

1:49:43.300 --> 1:49:52.860
 And I think something we should aim for is to do well by the lights of more than one

1:49:52.860 --> 1:49:55.260
 value system.

1:49:55.260 --> 1:50:06.380
 That is, we wouldn't have to choose only one value criterion and say we're going to do

1:50:06.380 --> 1:50:15.860
 something that scores really high on the metric of, say, hedonism, and then is like a zero

1:50:15.860 --> 1:50:22.520
 by other criteria, like kind of wireheaded brain synovat, and it's like a lot of pleasure,

1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:26.860
 that's good, but then like no beauty, no achievement like that.

1:50:26.860 --> 1:50:32.740
 Or pick it up, I think to some significant, not unlimited sense, but the significant sense,

1:50:32.740 --> 1:50:40.060
 it would be possible to do very well by many criteria, like maybe you could get like 98%

1:50:40.060 --> 1:50:47.900
 of the best according to several criteria at the same time, given this great expansion

1:50:47.900 --> 1:50:50.820
 of the option space.

1:50:50.820 --> 1:50:57.400
 So have competing value systems, competing criteria, as a sort of forever, just like

1:50:57.400 --> 1:51:02.780
 our Democrat versus Republican, there seems to be this always multiple parties that are

1:51:02.780 --> 1:51:08.260
 useful for our progress in society, even though it might seem dysfunctional inside the moment,

1:51:08.260 --> 1:51:14.820
 but having the multiple value system seems to be beneficial for, I guess, a balance of

1:51:14.820 --> 1:51:15.820
 power.

1:51:15.820 --> 1:51:21.740
 So that's, yeah, not exactly what I have in mind that it, well, although maybe in an indirect

1:51:21.740 --> 1:51:30.460
 way it is, but that if you had the chance to do something that scored well on several

1:51:30.460 --> 1:51:36.300
 different metrics, our first instinct should be to do that rather than immediately leap

1:51:36.300 --> 1:51:40.940
 to the thing, which ones of these value systems are we going to screw over?

1:51:40.940 --> 1:51:44.680
 Like our first, let's first try to do very well by all of them.

1:51:44.680 --> 1:51:49.140
 Then it might be that you can't get 100% of all and you would have to then like have the

1:51:49.140 --> 1:51:51.740
 hard conversation about which one will only get 97%.

1:51:51.740 --> 1:51:52.740
 There you go.

1:51:52.740 --> 1:51:57.540
 There's my cynicism that all of existence is always a trade off, but you say, maybe

1:51:57.540 --> 1:51:58.900
 it's not such a bad trade off.

1:51:58.900 --> 1:52:00.100
 Let's first at least try it.

1:52:00.100 --> 1:52:06.140
 Well, this would be a distinctive context in which at least some of the constraints

1:52:06.140 --> 1:52:07.140
 would be removed.

1:52:07.140 --> 1:52:08.140
 I'll leave it at that.

1:52:08.140 --> 1:52:10.560
 So there's probably still be trade offs in the end.

1:52:10.560 --> 1:52:16.820
 It's just that we should first make sure we at least take advantage of this abundance.

1:52:16.820 --> 1:52:21.580
 So in terms of thinking about this, like, yeah, one should think, I think in this kind

1:52:21.580 --> 1:52:31.060
 of frame of mind of generosity and inclusiveness to different value systems and see how far

1:52:31.060 --> 1:52:34.900
 one can get there at first.

1:52:34.900 --> 1:52:41.860
 And I think one could do something that would be very good according to many different criteria.

1:52:41.860 --> 1:52:50.300
 We kind of talked about AGI fundamentally transforming the value system of our existence,

1:52:50.300 --> 1:52:52.620
 the meaning of life.

1:52:52.620 --> 1:52:56.360
 But today, what do you think is the meaning of life?

1:52:56.360 --> 1:52:59.620
 The silliest or perhaps the biggest question, what's the meaning of life?

1:52:59.620 --> 1:53:03.060
 What's the meaning of existence?

1:53:03.060 --> 1:53:07.980
 What gives your life fulfillment, purpose, happiness, meaning?

1:53:07.980 --> 1:53:14.620
 Yeah, I think these are, I guess, a bunch of different but related questions in there

1:53:14.620 --> 1:53:17.500
 that one can ask.

1:53:17.500 --> 1:53:18.500
 Happiness meaning.

1:53:18.500 --> 1:53:19.500
 Yeah.

1:53:19.500 --> 1:53:22.900
 I mean, like you could imagine somebody getting a lot of happiness from something that they

1:53:22.900 --> 1:53:27.060
 didn't think was meaningful.

1:53:27.060 --> 1:53:31.620
 Like mindless, like watching reruns of some television series, waiting junk food, like

1:53:31.620 --> 1:53:35.940
 maybe some people that gives pleasure, but they wouldn't think it had a lot of meaning.

1:53:35.940 --> 1:53:39.740
 Whereas, conversely, something that might be quite loaded with meaning might not be

1:53:39.740 --> 1:53:45.640
 very fun always, like some difficult achievement that really helps a lot of people, maybe requires

1:53:45.640 --> 1:53:49.520
 self sacrifice and hard work.

1:53:49.520 --> 1:53:57.400
 So these things can, I think, come apart, which is something to bear in mind also when

1:53:57.400 --> 1:54:06.380
 if you're thinking about these utopia questions that you might, to actually start to do some

1:54:06.380 --> 1:54:12.500
 constructive thinking about that, you might have to isolate and distinguish these different

1:54:12.500 --> 1:54:16.360
 kinds of things that might be valuable in different ways.

1:54:16.360 --> 1:54:20.060
 Make sure you can sort of clearly perceive each one of them and then you can think about

1:54:20.060 --> 1:54:22.180
 how you can combine them.

1:54:22.180 --> 1:54:27.540
 And just as you said, hopefully come up with a way to maximize all of them together.

1:54:27.540 --> 1:54:33.300
 Yeah, or at least get, I mean, maximize or get like a very high score on a wide range

1:54:33.300 --> 1:54:35.100
 of them, even if not literally all.

1:54:35.100 --> 1:54:39.460
 You can always come up with values that are exactly opposed to one another, right?

1:54:39.460 --> 1:54:45.340
 But I think for many values, they're kind of opposed with, if you place them within

1:54:45.340 --> 1:54:51.860
 a certain dimensionality of your space, like there are shapes that are kind of, you can't

1:54:51.860 --> 1:54:57.220
 untangle like in a given dimensionality, but if you start adding dimensions, then it might

1:54:57.220 --> 1:55:02.140
 in many cases just be that they are easy to pull apart and you could.

1:55:02.140 --> 1:55:07.300
 So we'll see how much space there is for that, but I think that there could be a lot in this

1:55:07.300 --> 1:55:12.180
 context of radical abundance, if ever we get to that.

1:55:12.180 --> 1:55:15.580
 I don't think there's a better way to end it, Nick.

1:55:15.580 --> 1:55:20.980
 You've influenced a huge number of people to work on what could very well be the most

1:55:20.980 --> 1:55:22.660
 important problems of our time.

1:55:22.660 --> 1:55:23.660
 So it's a huge honor.

1:55:23.660 --> 1:55:24.660
 Thank you so much for talking.

1:55:24.660 --> 1:55:25.660
 Well, thank you for coming by, Lex.

 And now, let me leave you with some words from Nick Bostrom.

1:55:55.420 --> 1:56:00.060
 Our approach to existential risks cannot be one of trial and error.

1:56:00.060 --> 1:56:02.780
 There's no opportunity to learn from errors.

1:56:02.780 --> 1:56:09.500
 The reactive approach, see what happens, limit damages, and learn from experience is unworkable.

1:56:09.500 --> 1:56:13.140
 Rather, we must take a proactive approach.

1:56:13.140 --> 1:56:17.900
 This requires foresight to anticipate new types of threats and a willingness to take

1:56:17.900 --> 1:56:26.060
 decisive, preventative action and to bear the costs, moral and economic, of such actions.

1:56:26.060 --> 1:56:43.340
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
