00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
 The following is a conversation with Lisa Feldman Barrett,

00:03.600 --> 00:06.880
 a professor of psychology at Northeastern University,

00:06.880 --> 00:10.400
 and one of the most brilliant and bold thinkers and scientists

00:10.400 --> 00:12.480
 I've ever had the pleasure of speaking with.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.120
 She's the author of a book that revolutionized

00:15.120 --> 00:17.200
 our understanding of emotion in the brain

00:17.200 --> 00:19.440
 called How Emotions Are Made.

00:19.440 --> 00:22.320
 And she's coming out with a new book called

00:22.320 --> 00:24.960
 Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain

00:24.960 --> 00:28.160
 that you can and should preorder now.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.320
 I got a chance to read it already,

00:30.320 --> 00:31.920
 and it's one of the best short,

00:31.920 --> 00:35.440
 whirlwind introductions to the human brain I've ever read.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.280
 It comes out on November 17th,

00:37.280 --> 00:39.920
 but again, if there's anybody worth supporting,

00:39.920 --> 00:42.960
 it's Lisa, so please do preorder the book now.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.680
 Lisa and I agreed to speak once again

00:45.680 --> 00:47.840
 around the time of the book release,

00:47.840 --> 00:50.720
 especially because we felt that this first conversation

00:50.720 --> 00:52.240
 is good to release now,

00:52.240 --> 00:54.480
 since we talk about the divisive time

00:54.480 --> 00:56.560
 we're living through in the United States,

00:56.560 --> 00:58.800
 leading up to the election.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.760
 And she gives me a whole new way to think about it

01:01.760 --> 01:03.600
 from a neuroscience perspective

01:03.600 --> 01:06.400
 that is ultimately inspiring of empathy,

01:06.400 --> 01:08.080
 compassion, and love.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.400
 Quick mention of each sponsor,

01:10.400 --> 01:13.120
 followed by some thoughts related to this episode.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.760
 First sponsor is Athletic Greens,

01:15.760 --> 01:18.880
 the all in one drink that I start every day with

01:18.880 --> 01:20.960
 to cover all my nutritional bases

01:20.960 --> 01:23.360
 that I don't otherwise get through my diet naturally.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.520
 Second is Magic Spoon,

01:25.520 --> 01:27.920
 low carb, keto friendly, delicious cereal

01:27.920 --> 01:31.360
 that I reward myself with after a productive day.

01:31.360 --> 01:32.880
 The cocoa flavor is my favorite.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.360
 Third sponsor is Cash App,

01:35.360 --> 01:39.520
 the app I use to send money to friends for food, drinks,

01:39.520 --> 01:42.480
 and unfortunately, for the many bets I have lost to them.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.360
 Please check out these sponsors in the description

01:45.360 --> 01:48.080
 to get a discount and to support this podcast.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.680
 As a side note, let me say that the bold,

01:51.680 --> 01:53.760
 first principles way that Lisa approaches

01:53.760 --> 01:57.200
 our study of the brain is something that has inspired me

01:57.200 --> 01:59.200
 ever since I learned about her work.

01:59.200 --> 02:03.280
 And in fact, I invited her to speak at the AGI series

02:03.280 --> 02:05.680
 I organized at MIT several years ago.

02:06.240 --> 02:09.120
 But as a little twist, instead of a lecture,

02:09.120 --> 02:10.960
 we did a conversation in front of the class.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.600
 I think that was one of the early moments

02:13.600 --> 02:16.000
 that led me to start this very podcast.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.960
 It was scary and gratifying,

02:18.960 --> 02:21.120
 which is exactly what life is all about.

02:21.120 --> 02:24.000
 And it's kind of funny how life turns on little moments

02:24.000 --> 02:27.360
 like these that at the time don't seem to be anything

02:27.360 --> 02:28.640
 out of the ordinary.

02:39.760 --> 02:43.840
 And now, here's my conversation with Lisa Feldman Barrett.

02:44.960 --> 02:47.200
 Since we'll talk a lot about the brain today,

02:47.200 --> 02:49.600
 do you think, let's ask the craziest question,

02:49.600 --> 02:51.520
 do you think there's other intelligent life

02:51.520 --> 02:52.720
 out there in the universe?

02:53.760 --> 02:55.680
 Honestly, I've been asking myself lately

02:55.680 --> 02:57.760
 if there's intelligent life on this planet.

02:58.880 --> 03:05.120
 You know, I have to think probabilities suggest yes.

03:05.120 --> 03:08.880
 And also, secretly, I think I just hope that's true.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.840
 It would be really, I know scientists

03:11.840 --> 03:13.520
 aren't supposed to have hopes and dreams,

03:13.520 --> 03:16.640
 but I think it would be really cool.

03:16.640 --> 03:20.960
 And I also think it would be really sad if it wasn't the case.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.800
 If we really were alone, that would be,

03:24.080 --> 03:29.200
 that would seem profoundly sad, I think.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.960
 So it's exciting to you, not scary?

03:32.000 --> 03:35.920
 Yeah, no, you know, I take a lot of comfort and curiosity.

03:36.640 --> 03:44.400
 It's a great resource for dealing with stress.

03:44.400 --> 03:49.280
 So I'm learning all about mushrooms and octopuses

03:49.280 --> 03:50.960
 and, you know, all kinds of stuff.

03:51.840 --> 03:55.760
 And so for me, this counts, I think, in the realm of awe.

03:55.760 --> 03:59.600
 But also, I think I'm somebody who cultivates awe

03:59.600 --> 04:02.960
 deliberately on purpose to feel like a speck, you know?

04:02.960 --> 04:06.640
 I find it a relief occasionally.

04:06.640 --> 04:07.360
 To feel small.

04:07.360 --> 04:12.480
 To feel small in a profoundly large and interesting universe.

04:12.480 --> 04:17.840
 So, maybe to dig more technically on the question of intelligence,

04:17.840 --> 04:20.960
 do you think it's difficult for intelligent life to arise

04:20.960 --> 04:22.000
 like it did on Earth?

04:22.560 --> 04:25.520
 From everything you've written and studied about the brain,

04:26.320 --> 04:32.560
 how magical of a thing is it in terms of the odds it takes to arise?

04:32.560 --> 04:38.400
 Yeah, so, you know, magic is just, don't get me wrong.

04:38.400 --> 04:43.440
 I mean, I like a magic show as much as the next person.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.680
 My husband was a magician at one time.

04:45.680 --> 04:48.560
 But, you know, magic is just a bunch of stuff

04:48.560 --> 04:50.640
 that we don't really understand how it works yet.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.640
 So I would say from what I understand,

04:53.440 --> 04:59.040
 there are some major steps in the course of evolution

04:59.040 --> 05:00.720
 that at the beginning of life,

05:00.720 --> 05:04.000
 the step from single cell to multicellular organisms,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.480
 things like that, which are really not known.

05:06.480 --> 05:16.000
 I think for me, the question is not so much what's the likelihood

05:16.000 --> 05:22.560
 that it would happen again as much as what are the steps

05:22.560 --> 05:24.080
 and how long would it take?

05:24.080 --> 05:26.400
 And if it were to happen again on Earth,

05:28.160 --> 05:33.120
 would we end up with the same menu of life forms

05:33.120 --> 05:34.400
 that we currently have now?

05:34.400 --> 05:36.320
 And I think the answer is probably no, right?

05:36.320 --> 05:38.640
 There's just so much about evolution

05:38.640 --> 05:43.120
 that is stochastic and driven by chance.

05:43.120 --> 05:44.560
 But the question is whether that menu

05:44.560 --> 05:46.240
 would be equally delicious,

05:46.240 --> 05:49.840
 meaning like there'd be rich complexity of the kind of,

05:49.840 --> 05:52.480
 like would we get dolphins and humans

05:52.480 --> 05:54.640
 or whoever else falls in that category

05:54.640 --> 05:58.480
 of weirdly intelligent, seemingly intelligent?

05:59.120 --> 06:00.400
 However we define that.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.200
 Well, I think that has to be true.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.760
 If you just look at the range of creatures

06:05.760 --> 06:06.960
 who've gone extinct.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.600
 I mean, if you look at the range of creatures

06:09.600 --> 06:12.320
 that are on the Earth now, it's incredible.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.720
 And it's sort of tried to say that,

06:14.720 --> 06:16.720
 but it actually is really incredible.

06:18.080 --> 06:22.800
 Particularly, I don't know, I mean, animals,

06:22.800 --> 06:26.160
 there are animals that seem really ordinary

06:26.160 --> 06:27.680
 until you watch them closely

06:27.680 --> 06:29.360
 and then they become miraculous,

06:29.360 --> 06:30.880
 like certain types of birds,

06:30.880 --> 06:32.720
 which do very miraculous things,

06:32.720 --> 06:36.080
 build bowers and do dances

06:36.080 --> 06:37.600
 and all these really funky things

06:37.600 --> 06:39.840
 that are hard to explain

06:39.840 --> 06:41.600
 with a standard evolutionary story,

06:41.600 --> 06:43.760
 although people have them.

06:43.760 --> 06:44.720
 Yeah, the birds are weird.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.280
 They do a lot for mating purposes.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.840
 They have a concept of beauty

06:49.840 --> 06:52.560
 that I haven't quite, maybe you know much better,

06:52.560 --> 06:55.600
 but it doesn't seem to fit evolutionary arguments well.

06:55.600 --> 06:56.640
 It does fit.

06:56.640 --> 06:57.760
 Well, it depends, right?

06:57.760 --> 07:00.080
 So I think you're talking about the evolution of beauty,

07:00.080 --> 07:03.200
 the book that was written recently by,

07:03.200 --> 07:06.160
 was it Frum, was that his name?

07:06.160 --> 07:07.760
 Richard Frum, I think, at Yale.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.040
 Oh, I'm sorry, no, I didn't know.

07:09.040 --> 07:09.840
 Oh, it's a great book.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.120
 It's very controversial, though,

07:11.120 --> 07:14.400
 because he's making the argument

07:14.400 --> 07:17.760
 that the question about birds and some other animals

07:17.760 --> 07:19.680
 is why would they engage

07:19.680 --> 07:24.160
 in such metabolically costly displays

07:24.880 --> 07:27.280
 when it doesn't improve their fitness at all?

07:27.280 --> 07:31.120
 And the answer that he gives is the answer that Darwin gave,

07:31.120 --> 07:35.200
 which is sexual selection, not natural selection.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.520
 But selection can occur for all kinds of reasons.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.200
 There could be artificial selection,

07:39.200 --> 07:41.200
 which is when we breed animals, right?

07:41.200 --> 07:43.440
 Which is actually how Darwin,

07:43.440 --> 07:46.400
 that observation helped Darwin come to the idea

07:46.400 --> 07:47.760
 of natural selection.

07:47.760 --> 07:48.560
 Oh, I see.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.800
 And then there's sexual selection,

07:50.800 --> 07:53.440
 meaning, and the argument that,

07:53.440 --> 07:55.040
 I think his name is Frum,

07:55.040 --> 07:59.760
 makes is that it's the pleasure,

07:59.760 --> 08:03.120
 the selection pressure is the pleasure of female birds.

08:03.680 --> 08:07.200
 Which, as a woman, and as someone who studies affect,

08:07.200 --> 08:09.200
 that's a great answer.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.960
 I actually think there probably is natural,

08:10.960 --> 08:13.040
 I think there is an aspect of natural selection to it,

08:13.040 --> 08:14.720
 which he maybe hasn't considered.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.760
 But you were saying the reason we brought up birds

08:17.760 --> 08:20.960
 is the life we've got now seems to be quite incredible.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.880
 Yeah, so he brought up birds,

08:22.880 --> 08:25.200
 now seems to be quite incredible.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.640
 Yeah, so you peek into the ocean,

08:26.640 --> 08:29.600
 peek into the sky, there are miraculous creatures.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.920
 Look at creatures who've gone extinct.

08:31.920 --> 08:35.200
 And in science fiction stories,

08:35.200 --> 08:37.520
 you couldn't dream up something as interesting.

08:37.520 --> 08:43.760
 So my guess is that intelligent life evolves

08:43.760 --> 08:47.040
 in many different ways, even on this planet.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.880
 There isn't one form of intelligence.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.120
 There's not one brain that gives you intelligence.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.720
 There are lots of different brain structures

08:52.720 --> 08:53.840
 that can give you intelligence.

08:54.960 --> 08:59.200
 So my guess is that the menagerie

08:59.200 --> 09:01.520
 might not look exactly the way that it looks now,

09:01.520 --> 09:04.160
 but it would certainly be as interesting.

09:04.800 --> 09:09.280
 But if we look at the human brain versus the brains,

09:09.840 --> 09:10.880
 or whatever you call them,

09:11.440 --> 09:14.240
 the mechanisms of intelligence in our ancestors,

09:14.240 --> 09:15.920
 even early ancestors,

09:15.920 --> 09:18.240
 that you write about, for example, in your new book,

09:18.240 --> 09:25.440
 what's the difference between the fanciest brain we got,

09:25.440 --> 09:26.560
 which is the human brain,

09:27.200 --> 09:30.560
 and the ancestor brains that it came from?

09:31.520 --> 09:33.840
 Yeah, I think it depends on how far back you want to go.

09:34.560 --> 09:37.520
 You go all the way back, right, in your book.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.120
 So what's the interesting comparison, would you say?

09:41.120 --> 09:43.440
 Well, first of all, I wouldn't say that the human brain

09:43.440 --> 09:45.040
 is the fanciest brain we've got.

09:45.040 --> 09:48.000
 I mean, an octopus brain is pretty different

09:48.000 --> 09:48.960
 and pretty fancy,

09:48.960 --> 09:51.040
 and they can do some pretty amazing things

09:51.040 --> 09:51.920
 that we cannot do.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.320
 You know, we can't grow back limbs,

09:54.320 --> 09:56.800
 we can't change color and texture,

09:56.800 --> 09:59.760
 we can't comport ourselves and squeeze ourselves

09:59.760 --> 10:01.120
 into a little crevice.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.040
 I mean, these are things that we invent,

10:03.040 --> 10:04.640
 these are like superhero abilities

10:04.640 --> 10:06.160
 that we invent in stories, right?

10:06.160 --> 10:07.360
 We can't do any of those things.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.000
 And so the human brain is certainly,

10:11.120 --> 10:12.480
 we can certainly do some things

10:12.480 --> 10:13.760
 that other animals can't do.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.960
 That seemed pretty impressive to us.

10:16.960 --> 10:21.520
 But I would say that there are a number of animal brains

10:21.520 --> 10:23.440
 which seem pretty impressive to me

10:23.440 --> 10:25.280
 that can do interesting things

10:25.280 --> 10:27.680
 and really impressive things that we can't do.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.040
 I mean, with your work on how emotions are made and so on,

10:31.040 --> 10:34.560
 you kind of repaint the view of the brain

10:34.560 --> 10:38.400
 as less glamorous, I suppose,

10:38.400 --> 10:41.760
 than you would otherwise think.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.760
 Or like, I guess you draw a thread

10:43.760 --> 10:47.120
 that connects all brains together

10:47.120 --> 10:49.360
 in terms of homeostasis and all that kind of stuff.

10:50.080 --> 10:53.600
 Yeah, I wouldn't say that the human brain

10:53.600 --> 10:57.040
 is any less miraculous than anybody else would say.

10:57.040 --> 11:00.000
 I just think that there are other brain structures

11:00.000 --> 11:01.520
 which are also miraculous.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.080
 And I also think that there are a number of things

11:04.080 --> 11:07.520
 about the human brain which we share

11:07.520 --> 11:11.440
 with other vertebrates, other animals with backbones.

11:11.440 --> 11:16.480
 But that we share these miraculous things.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.040
 But we can do some things in abundance.

11:19.040 --> 11:22.720
 And we can also do some things with our brains together,

11:23.680 --> 11:27.120
 working together that other animals can't do.

11:27.120 --> 11:31.200
 Or at least we haven't discovered their ability to do it.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.320
 Yeah, this social thing.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.560
 That's one of the things you write about.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.760
 How do you make sense of the fact,

11:39.760 --> 11:43.680
 like the book Sapiens, and the fact that we're able

11:43.680 --> 11:46.640
 to kind of connect, like network our brains together

11:47.280 --> 11:48.400
 like you write about?

11:48.400 --> 11:50.240
 I'll try to stop saying that.

11:53.200 --> 11:56.640
 Is that like some kind of feature

11:56.640 --> 11:58.480
 that's built into there?

11:58.480 --> 12:00.160
 Is that unique to our human brains?

12:00.160 --> 12:01.280
 Like how do you make sense of that?

12:02.000 --> 12:04.240
 What I would say is that our ability

12:04.240 --> 12:09.200
 to coordinate with each other is not unique to humans.

12:09.200 --> 12:12.240
 There are lots of animals who can do that.

12:14.800 --> 12:19.840
 But what we do with that coordination is unique

12:20.560 --> 12:24.560
 because of some of the structural features in our brains.

12:25.120 --> 12:29.040
 And it's not that other animals

12:29.040 --> 12:30.560
 don't have those structural features.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.480
 It's we have them in abundance.

12:33.440 --> 12:38.000
 So the human brain is not larger

12:38.000 --> 12:42.560
 than you would expect it to be for a primate of our size.

12:42.560 --> 12:47.120
 If you took a chimpanzee and you grew it

12:47.120 --> 12:51.520
 to the size of a human, that chimpanzee would have a brain

12:51.520 --> 12:53.600
 that was the size of a human brain.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.000
 So there's nothing special about our brain

12:56.000 --> 12:57.360
 in terms of its size.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.680
 There's nothing special about our brain

12:59.680 --> 13:04.000
 in terms of the basic blueprint

13:04.000 --> 13:06.800
 that builds our brain from an embryo

13:06.800 --> 13:10.640
 is the basic blueprint that builds all mammalian brains

13:10.640 --> 13:12.560
 and maybe even all vertebrate brains.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.360
 It's just that because of its size

13:17.360 --> 13:19.120
 and particularly because of the size

13:19.120 --> 13:22.640
 of the cerebral cortex, which is a part

13:23.200 --> 13:27.680
 that people mistakenly attribute to rationality.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.360
 Why mistakenly?

13:29.360 --> 13:31.600
 Is that where all the clever stuff happens?

13:31.600 --> 13:33.520
 Well, no, it really isn't.

13:33.520 --> 13:36.240
 And I will also say that lots of clever stuff happens

13:36.240 --> 13:38.560
 in animals who don't have a cerebral cortex.

13:38.560 --> 13:43.560
 But because of the size of the cerebral cortex

13:43.920 --> 13:46.240
 and because of some of the features

13:46.240 --> 13:49.680
 that are enhanced by that size,

13:49.680 --> 13:52.560
 that gives us the capacity to do things

13:52.560 --> 13:57.560
 like build civilizations and coordinate with each other,

13:57.560 --> 14:01.600
 not just to manipulate the physical world,

14:01.600 --> 14:05.920
 but to add to it in very profound ways.

14:05.920 --> 14:09.040
 Like, other animals can cooperate with each other

14:09.040 --> 14:10.080
 and use tools.

14:11.040 --> 14:14.240
 We draw a line in the sand and we make countries

14:14.240 --> 14:19.240
 and then we create citizens and immigrants.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.760
 But also ideas.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.400
 I mean, the countries are centered around the concept

14:24.400 --> 14:25.840
 of like ideas.

14:25.840 --> 14:28.880
 Well, what do you think a citizen is and an immigrant?

14:28.880 --> 14:30.000
 Those are ideas.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.760
 Those are ideas that we impose on reality

14:33.760 --> 14:34.720
 and make them real.

14:34.720 --> 14:38.640
 And then they have very, very serious and real effects,

14:38.640 --> 14:40.280
 physical effects on people.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.160
 What do you think about the idea

14:42.160 --> 14:43.680
 that a bunch of people have written about,

14:43.680 --> 14:48.320
 Dawkins with memes, which is like ideas are breeding.

14:48.320 --> 14:53.320
 Like, we're just like the canvas for ideas to breed

14:53.320 --> 14:54.760
 in our brains.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.880
 So this kind of network that you talk about of brains

14:57.880 --> 14:59.720
 is just a little canvas for ideas

14:59.720 --> 15:02.600
 to then compete against each other and so on.

15:02.600 --> 15:07.600
 I think as a rhetorical tool, it's cool to think that way.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.800
 So I think it was Michael Pollan.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.960
 I don't remember if it was in the Botany of Desire,

15:12.960 --> 15:15.960
 but it was in one of his early books on botany

15:18.440 --> 15:23.440
 and gardening where he wrote about plants

15:23.440 --> 15:28.440
 and he wrote about plants utilizing humans

15:29.440 --> 15:32.640
 for their own evolutionary purposes.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.640
 Which is kind of interesting.

15:33.640 --> 15:36.520
 You can think about a human gut in a sense

15:36.520 --> 15:41.520
 as a propagation device for the seeds of tomatoes

15:42.760 --> 15:43.760
 and what have you.

15:43.760 --> 15:44.800
 So it's kind of cool.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.760
 So I think rhetorically it's an interesting device,

15:48.760 --> 15:53.760
 but ideas are, as far as I know, invented by humans,

15:55.080 --> 15:57.040
 propagated by humans.

15:58.240 --> 16:01.880
 So I don't think they're separate from human brains

16:01.880 --> 16:04.640
 in any way, although it is interesting

16:04.640 --> 16:06.840
 to think about it that way.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.680
 Well, of course, the ideas that are using your brain

16:09.680 --> 16:11.840
 to communicate and write excellent books.

16:13.160 --> 16:17.200
 And they basically picked you, Lisa,

16:17.200 --> 16:21.360
 as an effective communicator and thereby are winning.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.120
 So that's an interesting worldview

16:24.440 --> 16:27.160
 to think that there's particular aspects of your brain

16:28.120 --> 16:31.360
 that are conducive to certain sets of ideas

16:31.360 --> 16:33.440
 and maybe those ideas will win out.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.520
 Yeah, I think the way that I would say it really though

16:35.520 --> 16:38.160
 is that there are many species of animals

16:38.160 --> 16:40.280
 that influence each other's nervous systems,

16:40.280 --> 16:42.360
 that regulate each other's nervous systems,

16:42.360 --> 16:44.640
 and they mainly do it by physical means.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.600
 They do it by chemicals, scent.

16:47.600 --> 16:51.880
 They do it by, so termites and ants and bees,

16:51.880 --> 16:55.280
 for example, use chemical scents.

16:55.280 --> 16:59.520
 Mammals like rodents use scent

16:59.520 --> 17:02.600
 and they also use hearing, audition,

17:02.600 --> 17:04.160
 and that little bit of vision.

17:05.040 --> 17:08.440
 Primates, nonhuman primates add vision, right?

17:09.400 --> 17:13.520
 And I think everybody uses touch.

17:13.520 --> 17:16.000
 Humans, as far as I know, are the only species

17:16.000 --> 17:20.800
 that use ideas and words to regulate each other, right?

17:20.800 --> 17:24.520
 I can text something to someone halfway around the world.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.160
 They don't have to hear my voice.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.800
 They don't have to see my face

17:27.800 --> 17:30.680
 and I can have an effect on their nervous system.

17:30.680 --> 17:35.000
 And ideas, the ideas that we communicate with words,

17:35.000 --> 17:36.720
 I mean, words are in a sense a way

17:36.720 --> 17:39.200
 for us to do mental telepathy with each other, right?

17:39.200 --> 17:41.760
 I mean, I'm not the first person to say that obviously,

17:41.760 --> 17:45.520
 but how do I control your heart rate?

17:45.520 --> 17:46.760
 How do I control your breathing?

17:46.760 --> 17:49.960
 How do I control your actions with words?

17:49.960 --> 17:52.680
 It's because those words are communicating ideas.

17:54.120 --> 17:57.840
 So you also write, I think, let's go back to the brain.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.960
 You write that Plato gave us the idea

17:59.960 --> 18:04.960
 that the human brain has three brains in it, three forces,

18:05.240 --> 18:08.320
 which is kind of a compelling notion.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.440
 You disagree.

18:09.440 --> 18:12.640
 First of all, what are the three parts of the brain

18:12.640 --> 18:16.000
 and why do you disagree?

18:16.000 --> 18:20.600
 So Plato's description of the psyche,

18:20.600 --> 18:22.800
 which for the moment we'll just assume

18:22.800 --> 18:24.640
 is the same as a mind.

18:24.640 --> 18:27.600
 There are some scholars who would say a soul, a psyche,

18:27.600 --> 18:29.760
 a mind, those aren't actually all the same thing

18:29.760 --> 18:34.000
 in ancient Greece, but we'll just for now gloss over that.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.360
 So Plato's idea was that,

18:36.360 --> 18:41.360
 and it was a description of really about moral behavior

18:41.680 --> 18:44.040
 and moral responsibility in humans.

18:44.040 --> 18:47.240
 So the idea was that the human psyche can be described

18:47.240 --> 18:52.240
 with a metaphor of two horses and a charioteer.

18:53.640 --> 18:56.560
 So one horse for instincts,

18:57.560 --> 19:02.560
 like feeding and fighting and fleeing and reproduction.

19:02.560 --> 19:07.000
 I'm trying to control my salty language,

19:09.120 --> 19:11.000
 which apparently they print in England.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.720
 Like I actually tossed off a fairly.

19:14.720 --> 19:15.560
 F, S?

19:15.560 --> 19:17.880
 Yeah, F, F, yeah.

19:17.880 --> 19:19.080
 I was like, you printed that?

19:19.080 --> 19:20.360
 I couldn't believe you printed that.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.000
 Without like the stars or whatever?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.920
 No, no, no, it was full print.

19:23.920 --> 19:28.480
 They also printed a B word and it was really, yeah.

19:28.480 --> 19:32.240
 Well, we should learn something from England.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.360
 Indeed, anyways, but instincts.

19:34.360 --> 19:37.920
 And then the other horse represents emotions.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.080
 And then the charioteer represents rationality,

19:40.080 --> 19:43.640
 which controls the two beasts, right?

19:43.640 --> 19:48.640
 And fast forward a couple of centuries

19:49.440 --> 19:54.440
 and in the middle of the 20th century,

19:54.440 --> 19:57.960
 there was a very popular view of brain evolution,

19:57.960 --> 20:02.960
 which suggested that you have this reptilian core,

20:03.680 --> 20:08.280
 like an inner lizard brain for instincts.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.880
 And then wrapped around that evolved,

20:10.880 --> 20:15.880
 layer on top of that evolved a limbic system in mammals.

20:16.120 --> 20:18.680
 So the novelty was in a mammalian brain,

20:18.680 --> 20:23.360
 which bestowed mammals with, gave them emotions,

20:23.360 --> 20:24.600
 the capacity for emotions.

20:24.600 --> 20:29.600
 And then on top of that evolved a cerebral cortex,

20:32.520 --> 20:37.520
 which in largely in primates, but very large in humans.

20:41.600 --> 20:46.480
 And it's not that I personally disagree.

20:46.480 --> 20:49.440
 It's that as far back as the 1960s,

20:49.440 --> 20:54.040
 but really by the 1970s, it was shown pretty clearly

20:54.040 --> 20:55.840
 with evidence from molecular genetics.

20:55.840 --> 20:59.120
 So peering into cells in the brain

20:59.120 --> 21:02.960
 to look at the molecular makeup of genes

21:02.960 --> 21:05.840
 that the brain did not evolve that way.

21:05.840 --> 21:10.840
 And the irony is that the idea of the three layered brain

21:15.760 --> 21:20.680
 with an inner lizard that hijacks your behavior

21:20.680 --> 21:22.600
 and causes you to do and say things

21:22.600 --> 21:24.680
 that you would otherwise not,

21:24.680 --> 21:27.040
 or maybe that you will regret later.

21:27.040 --> 21:30.920
 That idea became very popular,

21:30.920 --> 21:35.920
 was popularized by Carl Sagan in The Dragons of Eden,

21:36.840 --> 21:40.800
 which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1977,

21:40.800 --> 21:42.680
 when it was already known pretty much

21:42.680 --> 21:44.360
 in evolutionary neuroscience

21:44.360 --> 21:46.840
 that the whole narrative was a myth.

21:47.720 --> 21:50.680
 So what the narrative is on the way it evolved,

21:50.680 --> 21:54.040
 but do you, I mean, again, it's that problem

21:54.040 --> 21:59.040
 of it being a useful tool of conversation

22:00.320 --> 22:02.320
 to say like there's a lizard brain

22:02.320 --> 22:05.800
 and there's a, like if I get overly emotional on Twitter,

22:05.800 --> 22:09.280
 that was the lizard brain and so on.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.360
 But do you?

22:10.360 --> 22:11.760
 No, I don't think it's useful.

22:11.760 --> 22:13.520
 I think it's, I think that.

22:13.520 --> 22:16.880
 Is it useful, is it accurate?

22:16.880 --> 22:18.320
 I don't think it's accurate,

22:18.320 --> 22:20.880
 and therefore I don't think it's useful.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.960
 So here's what I would say.

22:22.960 --> 22:27.960
 I think that the way I think about philosophy and science

22:30.200 --> 22:32.720
 is that they are useful tools for living.

22:34.360 --> 22:37.480
 And in order to be useful tools for living,

22:39.160 --> 22:44.160
 they have to help you make good decisions.

22:44.160 --> 22:47.480
 The triune brain, as it's called, this three layer brain,

22:47.480 --> 22:50.240
 the idea that your brain is like an already baked cake

22:50.240 --> 22:53.160
 and the cortex, cerebral cortex,

22:53.160 --> 22:54.920
 just layered on top like icing.

22:54.920 --> 22:59.920
 The idea, that idea is the foundation of the law

23:01.280 --> 23:03.560
 in most Western countries.

23:03.560 --> 23:07.920
 It's the foundation of economic theory

23:07.920 --> 23:11.000
 and it's a great narrative.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.800
 It sort of fits in with what I've been saying

23:13.800 --> 23:17.640
 fits our intuitions about how we work.

23:17.640 --> 23:22.640
 But it also, in addition to being wrong,

23:22.840 --> 23:27.840
 it lets people off the hook for nasty behavior.

23:29.160 --> 23:32.040
 And it also suggests that emotions

23:32.040 --> 23:35.160
 can't be a source of wisdom, which they often are.

23:36.040 --> 23:39.040
 In fact, you would not wanna be around someone

23:39.040 --> 23:40.720
 who didn't have emotions.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.280
 That would be, that's a psychopath.

23:43.280 --> 23:47.600
 I mean, that's not someone you wanna really

23:49.280 --> 23:50.760
 have that person deciding your outcome.

23:50.760 --> 23:54.120
 So I guess my, and I could sort of go on and on and on,

23:54.120 --> 23:59.120
 but my point is that I don't think,

23:59.240 --> 24:02.360
 I don't think it's a useful narrative in the end.

24:03.440 --> 24:06.440
 What's the more accurate view of the brain

24:06.440 --> 24:08.760
 that we should use when we're thinking about it?

24:08.760 --> 24:09.680
 I'll answer that in a second,

24:09.680 --> 24:12.760
 but I'll say that even our notion of what an instinct is

24:12.760 --> 24:16.840
 or what a reflex is, it's not quite right, right?

24:16.840 --> 24:21.840
 So if you look at evidence from ecology, for example,

24:22.280 --> 24:25.680
 and you look at animals in their ecological context,

24:25.680 --> 24:27.440
 what you can see is that even things

24:27.440 --> 24:32.440
 which are reflexes are very context sensitive.

24:33.920 --> 24:37.000
 The brains of those animals are executing

24:37.000 --> 24:39.440
 so called instinctual actions

24:39.440 --> 24:42.120
 in a very, very context sensitive way.

24:42.120 --> 24:46.880
 And so even when a physician takes the,

24:46.880 --> 24:49.520
 it's like the idea of your patellar reflex

24:49.520 --> 24:52.200
 where they hit your patellar tendon on your knee

24:52.200 --> 24:57.200
 and you kick, the force with which you kick and so on

24:57.640 --> 25:00.360
 is influenced by all kinds of things.

25:00.360 --> 25:05.120
 A reflex isn't like a robotic response.

25:05.120 --> 25:10.120
 And so I think a better way is a way that,

25:10.120 --> 25:12.000
 to think about how brains work,

25:12.000 --> 25:16.320
 is the way that matches our best understanding,

25:16.320 --> 25:17.760
 our best scientific understanding,

25:17.760 --> 25:21.040
 which I think is really cool

25:21.040 --> 25:24.360
 because it's really counterintuitive.

25:24.360 --> 25:26.000
 So how I came to this view,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.560
 and I'm certainly not the only one who holds this view.

25:28.560 --> 25:31.400
 I was reading work on neuroanatomy

25:31.400 --> 25:34.320
 and the view that I'm about to tell you

25:34.320 --> 25:36.880
 was strongly suggested by that.

25:36.880 --> 25:39.080
 And then I was reading work in signal processing,

25:39.080 --> 25:41.360
 like by electrical engineering.

25:41.360 --> 25:45.840
 And similarly, the work suggested that,

25:45.840 --> 25:48.080
 the research suggested that the brain worked this way.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.920
 And I'll just say that I was reading

25:49.920 --> 25:51.360
 across multiple literatures

25:51.360 --> 25:53.720
 and they were who don't speak to each other

25:53.720 --> 25:55.880
 and they were all pointing in this direction.

25:56.920 --> 26:00.560
 And so far, although some of the details

26:00.560 --> 26:02.120
 are still up for grabs,

26:02.120 --> 26:07.120
 the general gist I think is I've not come across anything yet

26:07.120 --> 26:10.400
 which really violates, and I'm looking.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.240
 And so the idea is something like this.

26:13.240 --> 26:14.640
 It's very counterintuitive.

26:15.720 --> 26:18.440
 So the way to describe it is to say

26:18.440 --> 26:22.360
 that your brain doesn't react to things in the world.

26:22.360 --> 26:25.360
 It's not, to us it feels like our eyes

26:25.360 --> 26:27.400
 are windows on the world.

26:27.400 --> 26:31.000
 We see things, we hear things, we react to them.

26:32.080 --> 26:34.880
 In psychology, we call this stimulus response.

26:34.880 --> 26:39.400
 So your face, your voice is a stimulus to me.

26:39.400 --> 26:43.320
 I receive input and then I react to it.

26:44.240 --> 26:48.400
 And I might react very automatically, system one.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.920
 But I also might execute some control

26:53.920 --> 26:57.360
 where I maybe stop myself from saying something

26:57.360 --> 27:02.360
 or doing something and in a more reflective way

27:02.520 --> 27:04.200
 execute a different action, right?

27:04.200 --> 27:05.280
 That's system two.

27:06.440 --> 27:08.240
 The way the brain works though,

27:08.240 --> 27:10.360
 is it's predicting all the time.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.760
 It's constantly talking to itself,

27:12.760 --> 27:15.840
 constantly talking to your body,

27:15.840 --> 27:20.840
 and it's constantly predicting what's going on in the body

27:20.840 --> 27:24.520
 and what's going on in the world and making predictions

27:24.520 --> 27:29.080
 and the information from your body and from the world

27:29.080 --> 27:32.320
 really confirm or correct those predictions.

27:32.320 --> 27:35.320
 So fundamentally the thing that the brain does

27:35.320 --> 27:39.960
 most of the time is just like talking to itself

27:39.960 --> 27:41.560
 and predicting stuff about the world,

27:41.560 --> 27:45.680
 not like this dumb thing that just senses and responds,

27:45.680 --> 27:46.520
 senses and responds.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.440
 Yeah, so the way to think about it is like this.

27:48.440 --> 27:52.480
 You know, your brain is trapped in a dark silent box.

27:52.480 --> 27:54.700
 Yeah, that's very romantic of you.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.200
 Which is your skull.

27:57.200 --> 28:01.280
 And the only information that it receives

28:01.280 --> 28:04.440
 from your body and from the world, right,

28:04.440 --> 28:07.440
 is through the senses, through the sense organs,

28:07.440 --> 28:09.200
 your eyes, your ears,

28:09.200 --> 28:14.000
 and you have sensory data that comes from your body

28:14.960 --> 28:17.920
 that you're largely unaware of to your brain,

28:17.920 --> 28:20.240
 which we call interoceptive,

28:20.240 --> 28:23.280
 as opposed to exteroceptive, which is the world around you.

28:23.280 --> 28:30.280
 But your brain is receiving sense data continuously,

28:31.280 --> 28:35.800
 which are the effect of some set of causes.

28:37.080 --> 28:41.240
 Your brain doesn't know the cause of these sense data.

28:41.240 --> 28:44.480
 It's only receiving the effects of those causes,

28:44.480 --> 28:46.360
 which are the data themselves.

28:46.360 --> 28:49.280
 And so your brain has to solve what philosophers call

28:49.280 --> 28:51.240
 an inverse inference problem.

28:51.240 --> 28:53.520
 How do you know, when you only receive

28:53.520 --> 28:54.480
 the effects of something,

28:54.480 --> 28:56.000
 how do you know what caused those effects?

28:56.000 --> 29:00.840
 So when there's a flash of light or a change in air pressure

29:00.840 --> 29:04.120
 or a tug somewhere in your body,

29:04.120 --> 29:09.120
 how does your brain know what caused those events

29:09.520 --> 29:13.880
 so that it knows what to do next to keep you alive and well?

29:15.560 --> 29:18.520
 And the answer is that your brain has one other source

29:18.520 --> 29:21.040
 of information available to it,

29:21.040 --> 29:23.760
 which is your past experience.

29:23.760 --> 29:28.760
 It can reconstitute in its wiring past experiences,

29:30.160 --> 29:34.360
 and it can combine those past experiences in novel ways.

29:34.360 --> 29:39.080
 And so we have lots of names for this in psychology.

29:39.080 --> 29:40.800
 We call it memory.

29:40.800 --> 29:42.400
 We call it perceptual inference.

29:42.400 --> 29:44.000
 We call it simulation.

29:45.800 --> 29:49.440
 It's also, we call it concepts or conceptual knowledge.

29:49.440 --> 29:50.920
 We call it prediction.

29:50.920 --> 29:54.840
 Basically, if we were to stop the world right now,

29:54.840 --> 29:58.760
 stop time, your brain is in a state,

30:00.320 --> 30:05.320
 and it's representing what it believes

30:05.680 --> 30:08.440
 is going on in your body and in the world.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.520
 And it's predicting what will happen next

30:11.520 --> 30:13.360
 based on past experience, right?

30:13.360 --> 30:15.880
 Probabilistically, what's most likely to happen.

30:15.880 --> 30:20.880
 And it begins to prepare your action,

30:24.200 --> 30:29.200
 and it begins to prepare your experience based,

30:31.040 --> 30:34.280
 so it's anticipating the sense data it's going to receive.

30:35.640 --> 30:38.160
 And then when those data come in,

30:38.160 --> 30:40.240
 they either confirm that prediction

30:40.240 --> 30:42.560
 and your action executes

30:42.560 --> 30:44.880
 because the plan's already been made,

30:44.880 --> 30:49.880
 or there's some sense data that your brain didn't predict

30:51.320 --> 30:54.000
 that's unexpected, and your brain takes it in.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.600
 We say encodes it.

30:55.600 --> 30:57.400
 We have a fancy name for that.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.840
 We call it learning.

30:58.840 --> 31:00.520
 Your brain learns,

31:00.520 --> 31:03.880
 and it updates its storehouse of knowledge,

31:03.880 --> 31:05.560
 which we call an internal model

31:07.200 --> 31:08.720
 so that you can predict better next time.

31:08.720 --> 31:11.280
 And it turns out that predicting and correcting,

31:11.280 --> 31:14.800
 predicting and correcting is a much more metabolically

31:14.800 --> 31:16.760
 efficient way to run a system

31:16.760 --> 31:18.760
 than constantly reacting all the time.

31:18.760 --> 31:20.120
 Because if you're constantly reacting,

31:20.120 --> 31:22.760
 it means you can't anticipate in any way

31:22.760 --> 31:24.200
 what's going to happen.

31:24.200 --> 31:27.680
 And so the amount of uncertainty that you have to deal with

31:27.680 --> 31:30.880
 is overwhelming to a nervous system.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.200
 Metabolically costly.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.040
 I like it.

31:33.040 --> 31:34.240
 And so what is a reflex?

31:34.240 --> 31:38.440
 A reflex is when your brain doesn't check

31:38.440 --> 31:40.360
 against the sense data.

31:40.360 --> 31:45.360
 That the potential cost to you is so great,

31:45.400 --> 31:48.360
 maybe because your life is threatened,

31:48.360 --> 31:50.760
 that your brain makes the prediction

31:50.760 --> 31:54.400
 and executes the action without checking.

31:55.240 --> 31:57.080
 Yeah, so but prediction is still at the core.

31:57.080 --> 31:58.640
 That's a beautiful vision of the brain.

31:58.640 --> 32:01.560
 I wonder, from almost an AI perspective,

32:01.560 --> 32:03.880
 but just computationally,

32:03.880 --> 32:07.000
 is the brain just mostly a prediction machine then?

32:07.000 --> 32:11.240
 Like is the perception just the nice little feature

32:11.240 --> 32:12.200
 added on top?

32:12.200 --> 32:15.480
 Like the, both the integration

32:15.480 --> 32:17.280
 of new perceptual information.

32:17.280 --> 32:21.360
 I wonder how big of an impressive system is that

32:21.360 --> 32:25.680
 relative to just the big predictor, model constructor.

32:25.680 --> 32:28.760
 Well, I think that we can look to evolution for that,

32:28.760 --> 32:32.120
 for one answer, which is that when you go back,

32:32.120 --> 32:35.640
 you know, 550 million years, give or take,

32:35.640 --> 32:38.720
 we, you know, the world was populated by creatures,

32:38.720 --> 32:41.040
 really ruled by creatures without brains.

32:43.080 --> 32:46.480
 And, you know, that's a biological statement,

32:46.480 --> 32:48.360
 not a political statement.

32:48.360 --> 32:49.200
 Really ruled with creatures with a.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.560
 You calling dinosaurs dumb?

32:50.560 --> 32:51.440
 You're talking about like.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.400
 Oh no, I'm not talking about dinosaurs, honey.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.760
 I'm talking way back, further back than that.

32:56.760 --> 32:58.600
 Really these, there are these little,

32:58.600 --> 33:01.840
 little creatures called amphioxus,

33:01.840 --> 33:04.240
 which is the modern, it's a, or a lancet.

33:04.240 --> 33:06.040
 That's the modern animal,

33:06.040 --> 33:10.320
 but it's an animal that scientists believe is very similar

33:10.320 --> 33:12.280
 to our common,

33:12.280 --> 33:16.680
 the common ancestor that we share with invertebrates

33:16.680 --> 33:21.120
 because, basically because of the tracing back,

33:21.120 --> 33:23.040
 the molecular genetics and cells.

33:23.040 --> 33:27.320
 And that animal had no brain.

33:27.320 --> 33:30.960
 It had some cells that would later turn into a brain,

33:30.960 --> 33:32.240
 but in that animal, there's no brain,

33:32.240 --> 33:34.520
 but that animal also had no head,

33:34.520 --> 33:36.840
 and it had no eyes, and it had no ears,

33:36.840 --> 33:40.880
 and it had really, really no senses for the most part.

33:40.880 --> 33:43.960
 It had very, very limited sense of touch.

33:43.960 --> 33:47.480
 It had an eye spot for, not for seeing,

33:47.480 --> 33:50.840
 but just for entraining to circadian rhythm,

33:50.840 --> 33:52.040
 to light and dark.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.480
 And it had no hearing.

33:54.480 --> 33:56.000
 It had a vestibular cell

33:56.000 --> 33:58.160
 so that it could keep upright in the water.

33:58.160 --> 34:02.800
 So at the time, we're talking evolutionary scale here,

34:02.800 --> 34:07.000
 so give or take some 100 million years or something,

34:07.000 --> 34:09.080
 but at the time, what are the vertebrate,

34:09.080 --> 34:13.280
 like when a backbone evolved and a brain evolved,

34:13.280 --> 34:18.280
 a full brain, that was when a head evolved with sense organs

34:19.160 --> 34:22.160
 and when that's when your viscera,

34:22.160 --> 34:23.760
 like internal systems involved.

34:23.760 --> 34:28.540
 So the answer I would say is that senses,

34:30.120 --> 34:31.080
 motor neuroscientists,

34:31.080 --> 34:33.680
 people who study the control of motor behavior

34:34.880 --> 34:39.880
 believe that senses evolved in the service of motor action.

34:41.520 --> 34:44.400
 So the idea is that,

34:44.400 --> 34:49.400
 like what triggered, what was the big evolutionary change?

34:49.400 --> 34:53.360
 What was the big pressure that made it useful

34:53.360 --> 34:56.840
 to have eyes and ears and a visual system

34:56.840 --> 34:59.240
 and an auditory system and a brain basically?

34:59.240 --> 35:04.240
 And the answer that is commonly entertained right now

35:05.320 --> 35:07.560
 is that it was predation,

35:07.560 --> 35:11.880
 that when at some point an animal evolved

35:11.880 --> 35:14.680
 that deliberately ate another animal

35:14.680 --> 35:19.680
 and this launched an arms race between predators and prey

35:20.080 --> 35:24.080
 and it became very useful to have senses, right?

35:24.080 --> 35:29.080
 So these little amphioxies don't really have,

35:32.760 --> 35:36.560
 they're not aware of their environment very much, really.

35:36.560 --> 35:41.560
 And so being able to look up ahead and ask yourself,

35:46.480 --> 35:51.480
 should I eat that or will it eat me is a very useful thing.

35:53.480 --> 35:58.480
 So the idea is that sense data

35:59.240 --> 36:01.160
 is not there for consciousness.

36:01.160 --> 36:03.920
 It didn't evolve for the purposes of consciousness.

36:03.920 --> 36:07.440
 It didn't evolve for the purposes of experiencing anything.

36:08.800 --> 36:13.360
 It evolved to be in the service of motor control.

36:13.360 --> 36:16.920
 However, maybe it's useful.

36:18.200 --> 36:23.200
 This is why scientists sometimes avoid questions

36:23.720 --> 36:25.520
 about why things evolved.

36:25.520 --> 36:28.400
 This is what philosophers call this teleology.

36:28.400 --> 36:33.360
 You might be able to say something about how things evolve,

36:33.360 --> 36:35.800
 but not necessarily why.

36:35.800 --> 36:38.680
 We don't really know the why.

36:38.680 --> 36:40.480
 That's all speculation.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.080
 But the why is kind of nice here.

36:42.080 --> 36:44.240
 The interesting thing is,

36:44.240 --> 36:47.400
 that was the first element of social interaction is,

36:47.400 --> 36:50.360
 am I gonna eat you or are you gonna eat me?

36:50.360 --> 36:55.360
 And for that, it's useful to be able to see each other,

36:55.560 --> 36:56.580
 sense each other.

36:57.720 --> 37:00.680
 That's kind of fascinating that there was a time

37:00.680 --> 37:03.040
 when life didn't eat each other.

37:03.040 --> 37:04.760
 Or they did by accident.

37:04.760 --> 37:06.760
 So an amphioxus, for example,

37:08.600 --> 37:11.300
 it kind of like gyrates in the water,

37:11.300 --> 37:14.620
 and then it plants itself in the sand

37:14.620 --> 37:17.040
 like a living blade of grass,

37:17.040 --> 37:21.460
 and then it just filters whatever comes into its mouth.

37:21.460 --> 37:25.960
 So it is eating, but it's not actively hunting.

37:25.960 --> 37:30.960
 And when the concentration of food decreases,

37:30.960 --> 37:35.280
 the amphioxus can sense this.

37:35.280 --> 37:40.280
 And so it basically wriggles itself randomly

37:40.640 --> 37:41.760
 to some other spot,

37:41.760 --> 37:44.700
 which probabilistically will have more food

37:44.700 --> 37:46.040
 than wherever it is.

37:46.040 --> 37:51.040
 So it's not guiding its actions on the basis of,

37:52.320 --> 37:55.920
 we would say there's no real intentional action

37:55.920 --> 37:58.560
 in the traditional sense.

37:58.560 --> 38:02.600
 Speaking of intentional action, and if the brain is,

38:02.600 --> 38:05.960
 if prediction is indeed a core component of the brain,

38:05.960 --> 38:09.560
 let me ask you a question that scientists also hate

38:09.560 --> 38:11.640
 is about free will.

38:11.640 --> 38:15.520
 So how does, do you think about free will much?

38:15.520 --> 38:19.480
 How does that fit into this, into your view of the brain?

38:19.480 --> 38:24.480
 Why does it feel like we make decisions in this world?

38:24.960 --> 38:26.960
 This is a hard, we scientists hate this,

38:26.960 --> 38:28.800
 this is a hard question we don't have the answer to.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.360
 Have you taken a side?

38:30.360 --> 38:31.680
 I think I have. Do you have free will?

38:31.680 --> 38:32.920
 I think I have taken a side,

38:32.920 --> 38:37.920
 but I don't put a lot of stock in my own intuitions

38:37.960 --> 38:41.000
 or anybody's intuitions about the cause of things.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.880
 One thing we know about the brain for sure

38:42.880 --> 38:46.320
 is that the brain creates experiences for us.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.900
 My brain creates experiences for me,

38:47.900 --> 38:49.940
 your brain creates experiences for you

38:49.940 --> 38:53.720
 in a way that lures you to believe that those experiences

38:53.720 --> 38:56.280
 actually reveals the way that it works,

38:56.280 --> 38:57.240
 but it doesn't.

38:59.640 --> 39:01.640
 So you don't trust your own intuition about free will?

39:01.640 --> 39:03.760
 Not really, not really.

39:03.760 --> 39:07.320
 No, I mean, no, but I am also somewhat persuaded by,

39:07.320 --> 39:09.640
 I think Dan Dennett wrote at one point,

39:11.760 --> 39:16.040
 the philosopher Dan Dennett wrote at one point that it's,

39:16.040 --> 39:18.080
 I can't say it as eloquently as him,

39:18.080 --> 39:20.760
 but people obviously have free will,

39:20.760 --> 39:22.540
 they are obviously making choices.

39:22.540 --> 39:27.540
 So there is this observation that we're not robots

39:27.960 --> 39:29.440
 and we can do some things

39:29.440 --> 39:31.800
 like a little more sophisticated than an amphioxus.

39:31.800 --> 39:35.200
 So here's what I would say.

39:35.200 --> 39:39.480
 I would say that your predictions,

39:39.480 --> 39:43.680
 your internal model that's running right now,

39:43.680 --> 39:46.920
 your ability to understand the sounds that I'm making

39:46.920 --> 39:50.460
 and attach them to ideas is based on the fact

39:50.460 --> 39:54.360
 that you have years of experience

39:54.360 --> 39:55.880
 knowing what these sounds mean

39:55.880 --> 40:00.880
 in a particular statistical pattern, right?

40:01.040 --> 40:03.220
 I mean, that's how you can understand the words

40:03.220 --> 40:06.280
 that are coming out of my mouth.

40:06.280 --> 40:09.320
 Right, I think we did this once before too, didn't we?

40:09.320 --> 40:10.160
 When we were.

40:10.160 --> 40:12.400
 I don't know, I would have to access my memory module.

40:12.400 --> 40:14.280
 I think when I was in your, when I.

40:14.280 --> 40:15.120
 The class thing?

40:15.120 --> 40:18.440
 Yeah, I think we did it just like that actually, so bravo.

40:18.440 --> 40:21.520
 Wow, I have to go look back to the tape.

40:21.520 --> 40:25.560
 Yeah, anyways, the idea though

40:25.560 --> 40:28.860
 is that your brain is using past experience

40:28.860 --> 40:32.020
 and it can use past experience in,

40:33.560 --> 40:36.200
 so it's remembering, but you're not consciously remembering.

40:36.200 --> 40:40.080
 It's basically re implementing prior experiences

40:40.080 --> 40:42.120
 as a way of predicting what's gonna happen next.

40:42.120 --> 40:44.720
 And it can do something called conceptual combination,

40:44.720 --> 40:48.240
 which is it can take bits and pieces of the past

40:48.240 --> 40:50.280
 and combine it in new ways.

40:50.280 --> 40:55.280
 So you can experience and make sense of things

40:55.720 --> 40:57.600
 that you've never encountered before

40:57.600 --> 41:00.640
 because you've encountered something similar to them.

41:04.160 --> 41:09.160
 And so a brain in a sense is not just,

41:10.900 --> 41:13.000
 doesn't just contain information.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.840
 It is information gaining,

41:14.840 --> 41:17.880
 meaning it can create new information

41:17.880 --> 41:19.600
 by this generative process.

41:19.600 --> 41:20.820
 So in a sense, you could say, well,

41:20.820 --> 41:23.260
 that maybe that's a source of free will.

41:23.260 --> 41:25.760
 But I think really where free will comes from

41:25.760 --> 41:27.320
 or the kind of free will that I think

41:27.320 --> 41:29.440
 is worth having a conversation about

41:32.160 --> 41:36.400
 involves cultivating experiences for yourself

41:36.400 --> 41:40.200
 that change your internal model.

41:40.200 --> 41:42.940
 When you were born and you were raised

41:42.940 --> 41:47.940
 in a particular context, your brain wired itself

41:48.680 --> 41:51.640
 to your surroundings, to your physical surroundings

41:51.640 --> 41:53.480
 and also to your social surroundings.

41:53.480 --> 41:57.340
 So you were handed an internal model basically.

41:58.300 --> 42:01.520
 But when you grow up,

42:01.520 --> 42:05.560
 the more control you have over where you are

42:05.560 --> 42:10.200
 and what you do, you can cultivate new experiences

42:10.200 --> 42:11.500
 for yourself.

42:11.500 --> 42:16.500
 And those new experiences can change your internal model.

42:16.520 --> 42:21.080
 And you can actually practice those experiences

42:21.080 --> 42:24.280
 in a way that makes them automatic,

42:24.280 --> 42:26.840
 meaning it makes it easier for the brain,

42:26.840 --> 42:28.920
 your brain to make them again.

42:28.920 --> 42:33.480
 And I think that that is something like

42:33.480 --> 42:35.320
 what you would call free will.

42:35.320 --> 42:40.320
 You aren't responsible for the model that you were handed,

42:40.320 --> 42:45.320
 that someone, your caregivers cultivated a model

42:46.120 --> 42:47.160
 in your brain.

42:47.160 --> 42:49.280
 You're not responsible for that model,

42:49.280 --> 42:52.400
 but you are responsible for the one you have now.

42:52.400 --> 42:56.320
 You can choose, you choose what you expose yourself to.

42:56.320 --> 42:59.360
 You choose how you spend your time.

42:59.360 --> 43:02.080
 Not everybody has choice over everything,

43:02.080 --> 43:04.480
 but everybody has a little bit of choice.

43:04.480 --> 43:09.480
 And so I think that is something that I think

43:11.640 --> 43:13.520
 is arguably called free will.

43:13.520 --> 43:18.340
 Yeah, the ripple effects of the billions of decisions

43:18.340 --> 43:23.340
 you make early on in life are so great

43:23.720 --> 43:27.400
 that even if it's not,

43:27.400 --> 43:30.280
 even if it's like all deterministic,

43:30.280 --> 43:35.280
 just the amount of possibilities that are created

43:35.680 --> 43:38.480
 and then the focusing on those possibilities

43:38.480 --> 43:40.140
 into a single trajectory,

43:41.600 --> 43:45.000
 that somewhere within that, that's free will.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.340
 Even if it's all deterministic,

43:47.340 --> 43:51.920
 that might as well be just the number of choices

43:51.920 --> 43:53.800
 that are possible and the fact that you just make

43:53.800 --> 43:56.200
 one trajectory to those set of choices

43:56.200 --> 43:58.200
 seems to be like something like

43:58.200 --> 43:59.480
 they'll be called free will.

43:59.480 --> 44:02.200
 But it's still kind of sad to think like

44:02.200 --> 44:03.880
 there doesn't seem to be a place

44:03.880 --> 44:05.800
 where there's magic in there,

44:05.800 --> 44:08.120
 where it is all just the computer.

44:08.120 --> 44:10.680
 Well, there's lots of magic, I would say, so far,

44:10.680 --> 44:12.840
 because we don't really understand

44:13.720 --> 44:18.500
 how all of this is exactly played out at a,

44:20.740 --> 44:23.060
 I mean, scientists are working hard

44:23.060 --> 44:26.120
 and disagree about some of the details

44:26.120 --> 44:28.520
 under the hood of what I just described,

44:28.520 --> 44:31.360
 but I think there's quite a bit of magic actually.

44:31.360 --> 44:36.360
 And also there's also stochastic firing of,

44:38.160 --> 44:42.700
 neurons don't, they're not purely digital

44:42.700 --> 44:45.100
 in the sense that there is,

44:45.100 --> 44:47.600
 there's also analog communication between neurons,

44:47.600 --> 44:48.840
 not just digital.

44:48.840 --> 44:51.960
 So it's not just with firing of axons.

44:51.960 --> 44:55.680
 And some of that, there are other ways to communicate.

44:55.680 --> 45:00.680
 And also there's noise in the system

45:01.640 --> 45:04.200
 and the noise is there for a really good reason.

45:04.200 --> 45:08.560
 And that is the more variability there is,

45:08.560 --> 45:12.320
 the more potential there is for your brain

45:12.320 --> 45:15.600
 to be able to be information bearing.

45:15.600 --> 45:20.340
 So basically, there are some animals

45:20.340 --> 45:22.720
 that have clusters of cells.

45:22.720 --> 45:25.600
 The only job is to inject noise.

45:25.600 --> 45:27.960
 You know, into their neural patterns.

45:27.960 --> 45:30.200
 So maybe noise is the source of free will.

45:30.200 --> 45:34.560
 So you can think about stochasticity or noise

45:34.560 --> 45:36.760
 as a source of free will,

45:36.760 --> 45:40.480
 or you can think of conceptual combination

45:40.480 --> 45:42.320
 as a source of free will.

45:42.320 --> 45:45.780
 You can certainly think about cultivating,

45:46.720 --> 45:49.200
 you know, you can't reach back into your past

45:49.200 --> 45:51.080
 and change your past.

45:51.080 --> 45:54.280
 You know, people try by psychotherapy and so on,

45:54.280 --> 45:57.360
 but what you can do is change your present,

45:59.240 --> 46:01.080
 which becomes your past.

46:02.120 --> 46:03.760
 Right?

46:03.760 --> 46:08.040
 So one way to think about it is that you're continuously,

46:08.040 --> 46:10.800
 this is a colleague of mine, a friend of mine said,

46:10.800 --> 46:12.560
 so what you're saying is that people

46:12.560 --> 46:15.640
 are continually cultivating their past.

46:15.640 --> 46:17.200
 And I was like, that's very poetic.

46:17.200 --> 46:21.200
 Yes, you are continually cultivating your past

46:21.200 --> 46:24.440
 as a means of controlling your future.

46:26.760 --> 46:29.700
 So you think, yeah, I guess the construction

46:29.700 --> 46:32.880
 of the mental model that you use for prediction

46:32.880 --> 46:36.660
 ultimately contains within it your perception of the past,

46:36.660 --> 46:38.800
 like the way you interpret the past,

46:38.800 --> 46:41.860
 or even just the entirety of your narrative about the past.

46:41.860 --> 46:44.560
 So you're constantly rewriting the story of your past.

46:45.480 --> 46:46.960
 Oh boy.

46:46.960 --> 46:48.080
 Yeah.

46:48.080 --> 46:51.120
 That's one poetic and also just awe inspiring.

46:51.120 --> 46:55.320
 What about the other thing you talk about?

46:55.320 --> 46:57.280
 You've mentioned about sensory perception

46:57.280 --> 47:00.760
 as a thing that like is just,

47:00.760 --> 47:03.600
 you have to infer about the sources of the thing

47:03.600 --> 47:07.560
 that you have perceived through your senses.

47:07.560 --> 47:12.160
 So let me ask another ridiculous question.

47:12.160 --> 47:14.200
 Is anything real at all?

47:14.200 --> 47:15.720
 Like, how do we know it's real?

47:15.720 --> 47:19.080
 How do we make sense of the fact that just like you said,

47:19.080 --> 47:21.320
 there's this brain sitting alone in the darkness

47:21.320 --> 47:23.160
 trying to perceive the world.

47:23.160 --> 47:27.200
 How do we know that the world is out there to be perceived?

47:27.200 --> 47:30.360
 Yeah, so I don't think that you should be asking questions

47:30.360 --> 47:32.520
 like that without passing a joint.

47:32.520 --> 47:33.760
 Right, no, for sure.

47:33.760 --> 47:36.200
 I actually did before this, so I apologize.

47:36.200 --> 47:37.640
 Okay, no, well, that's okay.

47:37.640 --> 47:38.720
 You apologize for not sharing.

47:38.720 --> 47:39.560
 That's okay.

47:39.560 --> 47:41.080
 So, I mean, here's what I would say.

47:41.080 --> 47:43.280
 What I would say is that the reason why

47:43.280 --> 47:46.120
 we can be pretty sure that there's a there there

47:46.120 --> 47:51.120
 is that the structure of the information in the world,

47:51.600 --> 47:53.920
 what we call statistical regularities

47:53.920 --> 47:56.040
 in sights and sounds and so on,

47:56.040 --> 47:57.840
 and the structure of the information

47:57.840 --> 48:00.640
 that comes from your body, it's not random stuff.

48:00.640 --> 48:02.000
 There's a structure to it.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.040
 There's a spatial structure and a temporal structure.

48:05.040 --> 48:08.640
 And that spatial and temporal structure wires your brain.

48:08.640 --> 48:13.000
 So an infant brain is not a miniature adult brain.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.800
 It's a brain that is waiting for wiring instructions

48:16.800 --> 48:18.320
 from the world.

48:18.320 --> 48:21.400
 And it must receive those wiring instructions

48:21.400 --> 48:23.960
 to develop in a typical way.

48:23.960 --> 48:27.480
 So, for example, when a newborn is born,

48:27.480 --> 48:30.920
 when a newborn is born, when a baby is born,

48:32.240 --> 48:36.560
 the baby can't see very well

48:36.560 --> 48:39.280
 because the visual system in that baby's brain

48:39.280 --> 48:41.120
 is not complete.

48:42.440 --> 48:47.120
 The retina of your eye, which actually is part of your brain,

48:47.120 --> 48:49.800
 has to be stimulated with photons of light.

48:49.800 --> 48:53.440
 If it's not, the baby won't develop normally

48:53.440 --> 48:56.240
 to be able to see in a neurotypical way.

48:56.240 --> 48:57.840
 Same thing is true for hearing.

48:57.840 --> 49:00.440
 The same thing is true really for all your senses.

49:00.440 --> 49:05.440
 So the point is that the physical world

49:05.440 --> 49:09.160
 the physical world, the sense data from the physical world

49:09.160 --> 49:12.760
 wires your brain so that you have an internal model

49:12.760 --> 49:16.240
 of that world so that your brain can predict well

49:16.240 --> 49:19.800
 to keep you alive and well and allow you to thrive.

49:19.800 --> 49:22.200
 That's fascinating that the brain is waiting

49:23.200 --> 49:26.600
 for a very specific kind of set of instructions

49:26.600 --> 49:27.440
 from the world.

49:27.440 --> 49:29.040
 Like not the specific,

49:29.040 --> 49:31.880
 but a very specific kind of instructions.

49:31.880 --> 49:35.120
 So scientists call it expectable input.

49:35.120 --> 49:39.320
 The brain needs some input in order to develop normally.

49:39.320 --> 49:44.320
 And we are genetically, as I say in the book,

49:44.760 --> 49:48.320
 we have the kind of nature that requires nurture.

49:48.320 --> 49:53.200
 We can't develop normally without sensory input

49:53.200 --> 49:55.240
 from the world and from the body.

49:55.240 --> 49:57.960
 And what's really interesting about humans

49:57.960 --> 50:02.960
 and some other animals too, but really seriously in humans,

50:02.960 --> 50:07.960
 is the input that we need is not just physical.

50:08.040 --> 50:10.280
 It's also social.

50:10.280 --> 50:14.040
 We, in order for an infant, a human infant

50:14.040 --> 50:19.040
 to develop normally, that infant needs eye contact, touch.

50:19.880 --> 50:22.480
 It needs certain types of smells.

50:22.480 --> 50:24.640
 It needs to be cuddled.

50:24.640 --> 50:25.800
 It needs, right?

50:25.800 --> 50:30.800
 So without social input,

50:30.800 --> 50:35.800
 that infant's brain will not wire itself

50:36.800 --> 50:38.000
 in a neurotypical way.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.040
 And again, I would say there are lots

50:41.040 --> 50:46.040
 of cultural patterns of caring for an infant.

50:46.440 --> 50:49.240
 It's not like the infant has to be cared for in one way.

50:50.240 --> 50:54.880
 Whatever the social environment is for an infant,

50:54.880 --> 50:59.120
 that will be reflected in that infant's internal model.

50:59.120 --> 51:00.520
 So we have lots of different cultures,

51:00.520 --> 51:02.760
 lots of different ways of rearing children.

51:02.760 --> 51:05.640
 And that's an advantage for our species,

51:05.640 --> 51:07.320
 although we don't always experience it that way.

51:07.320 --> 51:09.120
 That is an advantage for our species.

51:10.000 --> 51:15.000
 But if you just feed and water a baby

51:15.920 --> 51:20.240
 without all the extra social doodads,

51:20.240 --> 51:25.240
 what you get is a profoundly impaired human.

51:25.440 --> 51:28.640
 Yeah, but nevertheless, you're kind of saying

51:28.640 --> 51:33.640
 that the physical reality has a consistent thing

51:34.440 --> 51:38.080
 throughout that keeps feeding these set

51:38.080 --> 51:43.080
 of sensory information that our brains are constructed for.

51:43.880 --> 51:44.880
 Yeah, the cool thing though,

51:44.880 --> 51:47.120
 is that if you change the consistency,

51:47.120 --> 51:49.720
 if you change the statistical regularities,

51:49.720 --> 51:52.040
 so prediction error, your brain can learn it.

51:52.040 --> 51:53.800
 It's expensive for your brain to learn it.

51:53.800 --> 51:55.800
 And it takes a while for the brain

51:55.800 --> 51:57.080
 to get really automated with it.

51:57.080 --> 52:01.680
 But you had a wonderful conversation with David Edelman,

52:01.680 --> 52:04.200
 who just published a book about this

52:04.200 --> 52:07.720
 and gave lots and lots of really very, very cool examples.

52:07.720 --> 52:09.840
 Some of which I actually discussed

52:09.840 --> 52:11.000
 in How Emotions Were Made,

52:11.000 --> 52:14.360
 but not obviously to the extent that he did in his book.

52:14.360 --> 52:15.560
 It's a fascinating book,

52:15.560 --> 52:20.560
 but it speaks to the point that your internal model

52:21.560 --> 52:23.120
 is always under construction.

52:23.120 --> 52:28.120
 And therefore, you always can modify your experience.

52:30.440 --> 52:31.720
 I wonder what the limits are.

52:31.720 --> 52:36.240
 Like if we put it on Mars or if we put it in virtual reality

52:36.240 --> 52:39.280
 or if we sit at home during a pandemic

52:39.280 --> 52:42.720
 and we spend most of our day on Twitter and TikTok,

52:42.720 --> 52:45.000
 like I wonder where the breaking point,

52:45.000 --> 52:48.200
 like the limitations of the brain's capacity

52:48.200 --> 52:53.200
 to properly continue wiring itself.

52:54.120 --> 52:56.440
 Well, I think what I would say is that

52:56.440 --> 53:00.200
 there are different ways to specify your question, right?

53:00.200 --> 53:01.760
 Like one way to specify it

53:01.760 --> 53:05.800
 would be the way that David phrases it,

53:05.800 --> 53:09.840
 which is can we create a new sense?

53:09.840 --> 53:14.040
 Like can we create a new sensory modality?

53:14.040 --> 53:15.520
 How hard would that be?

53:15.520 --> 53:19.520
 What are the limits in doing that?

53:19.520 --> 53:23.760
 But another way to say it is what happens to a brain

53:23.760 --> 53:27.360
 when you remove some of those statistical regularities,

53:27.360 --> 53:28.200
 right?

53:28.200 --> 53:30.160
 Like what happens to an adult brain

53:30.160 --> 53:35.160
 when you remove some of the statistical patterns

53:36.040 --> 53:37.920
 that were there and they're not there anymore?

53:37.920 --> 53:39.720
 Are you talking about in the environment

53:39.720 --> 53:43.880
 or in the actual like you remove eyesight, for example?

53:43.880 --> 53:44.800
 Well, either way.

53:44.800 --> 53:49.800
 I mean, basically one way to limit the inputs to your brain

53:49.800 --> 53:53.080
 are to stay home and protect yourself.

53:53.080 --> 53:57.480
 Another way is to put someone in solitary confinement.

53:57.480 --> 54:01.200
 Another way is to stick them in a nursing home.

54:02.720 --> 54:06.960
 Well, not all nursing homes, but there are some, right?

54:06.960 --> 54:11.960
 Which really are where people are somewhat impoverished

54:11.960 --> 54:15.200
 in the interactions and the variety

54:15.200 --> 54:17.440
 of sensory stimulation that they get.

54:17.440 --> 54:20.960
 Another way is that you lose a sense, right?

54:20.960 --> 54:25.920
 But the point is I think that the human brain

54:25.920 --> 54:30.920
 really likes variety, to say it in a sort of Cartesian way.

54:36.560 --> 54:39.600
 Variety is a good thing for a brain.

54:39.600 --> 54:44.600
 And there are risks that you take

54:48.680 --> 54:52.200
 when you restrict what you expose yourself to.

54:54.080 --> 54:56.960
 Yeah, you know, there's all this talk of diversity.

54:56.960 --> 55:00.360
 The brain loves it to the fullest definition

55:00.360 --> 55:01.920
 and degree of diversity.

55:01.920 --> 55:04.080
 Yeah, I mean, I would say the only thing,

55:04.080 --> 55:07.480
 basically human brains thrive on diversity.

55:07.480 --> 55:10.120
 The only place where we seem to have difficulty

55:10.120 --> 55:13.680
 with diversity is with each other, right?

55:13.680 --> 55:16.480
 But who wants to eat the same food every day?

55:16.480 --> 55:17.440
 You never would.

55:17.440 --> 55:19.360
 Who wants to wear the same clothes every day?

55:19.360 --> 55:21.800
 I mean, my husband, if you ask him to close his eyes,

55:21.800 --> 55:24.680
 he won't be able to tell you what he's wearing, right?

55:24.680 --> 55:27.800
 He'll buy seven shirts of exactly the same style

55:27.800 --> 55:30.840
 in different colors, but they are in different colors, right?

55:30.840 --> 55:31.800
 It's not like he's wearing.

55:31.800 --> 55:35.200
 How would you then explain my brain,

55:35.200 --> 55:36.920
 which is terrified of choice

55:36.920 --> 55:39.400
 and therefore wear the same thing every time?

55:39.400 --> 55:41.440
 Well, you must be getting your diversity.

55:41.440 --> 55:43.440
 Well, first of all, you are a fairly sharp dresser,

55:43.440 --> 55:47.080
 so there is that, but you're getting some reinforcement

55:47.080 --> 55:48.440
 for dressing the way you do.

55:48.440 --> 55:52.400
 But no, your brain must get diversity in other places.

55:52.400 --> 55:55.040
 But I think we, you know,

55:56.080 --> 55:59.280
 so the two most expensive things your brain can do,

55:59.280 --> 56:04.280
 metabolically speaking, is move your body and learn.

56:04.280 --> 56:08.080
 And learn something new.

56:08.080 --> 56:12.520
 So novelty, that is diversity, right,

56:12.520 --> 56:14.280
 comes at a cost, a metabolic cost,

56:14.280 --> 56:19.200
 but it's a cost, it's an investment that gives returns.

56:19.200 --> 56:21.920
 And in general, people vary

56:21.920 --> 56:24.480
 in how much they like novelty, unexpected things.

56:24.480 --> 56:26.000
 Some people really like it.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.680
 Some people really don't like it,

56:27.680 --> 56:29.320
 and there's everybody in between.

56:29.320 --> 56:32.800
 But in general, we don't eat the same thing every day.

56:32.800 --> 56:36.240
 We don't usually do exactly the same thing

56:36.240 --> 56:37.840
 in exactly the same order,

56:37.840 --> 56:40.520
 in exactly the same place every day.

56:41.440 --> 56:43.960
 The only place we have difficulty

56:43.960 --> 56:48.400
 with diversity is in each other.

56:48.400 --> 56:50.800
 And then we have considerable problems there,

56:50.800 --> 56:52.960
 I would say, as a species.

56:52.960 --> 56:55.000
 Let me ask, I don't know if you're familiar

56:55.000 --> 57:00.000
 with Donald Hoffman's work about questions of reality.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.920
 What are your thoughts of the possibility

57:03.920 --> 57:06.920
 that the very thing we've been talking about,

57:06.920 --> 57:10.680
 of the brain wiring itself from birth

57:10.680 --> 57:12.840
 to a particular set of inputs,

57:12.840 --> 57:15.360
 is just a little slice of reality,

57:15.360 --> 57:17.480
 that there is something much bigger out there

57:17.480 --> 57:21.680
 that we humans, with our cognition, cognitive capabilities,

57:21.680 --> 57:23.800
 is just not even perceiving.

57:23.800 --> 57:26.880
 The thing we're perceiving is just a crappy,

57:26.880 --> 57:31.880
 like Windows 95 interface onto a much bigger,

57:32.200 --> 57:35.360
 richer set of complex physics

57:35.360 --> 57:37.720
 that we're not even in touch with.

57:38.840 --> 57:41.280
 Well, without getting too metaphysical about it,

57:41.280 --> 57:42.600
 I think we know for sure.

57:42.600 --> 57:47.600
 It doesn't have to be the crappy version of anything,

57:47.800 --> 57:50.120
 but we definitely have a limited,

57:50.120 --> 57:53.240
 we have a set of senses that are limited

57:53.240 --> 57:55.080
 in very physical ways,

57:55.080 --> 57:57.240
 and we're clearly not perceiving everything

57:57.240 --> 57:58.600
 there is to perceive.

57:58.600 --> 57:59.840
 That's clear.

57:59.840 --> 58:01.560
 I mean, it's just, it's not that hard.

58:01.560 --> 58:03.280
 We can't, without special,

58:03.280 --> 58:04.960
 why do we invent scientific tools?

58:04.960 --> 58:07.080
 It's so that we can overcome our senses

58:07.080 --> 58:10.360
 and experience things that we couldn't otherwise,

58:10.360 --> 58:14.200
 whether they are different parts of the visual spectrum,

58:14.200 --> 58:15.200
 the light spectrum,

58:15.200 --> 58:19.480
 or things that are too microscopically small for us to see

58:19.480 --> 58:22.480
 or too far away for us to see.

58:22.480 --> 58:25.600
 So clearly, we're only getting a slice,

58:27.440 --> 58:29.480
 and that slice,

58:32.360 --> 58:37.360
 the interesting or potentially sad thing about humans

58:38.120 --> 58:40.640
 is that we, whatever we experience,

58:40.640 --> 58:43.560
 we think there's a natural reason for experiencing it,

58:44.600 --> 58:46.360
 and we think it's obvious and natural

58:46.360 --> 58:48.440
 and it must be this way,

58:48.440 --> 58:50.720
 and that all the other stuff isn't important.

58:50.720 --> 58:52.320
 And that's clearly not true.

58:53.200 --> 58:55.400
 Many of the things that we think of as natural

58:55.400 --> 58:57.000
 are anything but,

58:57.000 --> 59:00.240
 they're certainly real, but we've created them.

59:00.240 --> 59:02.080
 They certainly have very real impacts,

59:02.080 --> 59:04.280
 but we've created those impacts.

59:04.280 --> 59:06.560
 And we also know that there are many things

59:06.560 --> 59:10.600
 outside of our awareness that have tremendous influence

59:10.600 --> 59:13.160
 on what we experience and what we do.

59:13.160 --> 59:16.640
 So there's no question that that's true.

59:16.640 --> 59:18.480
 I mean, just, it's,

59:18.480 --> 59:22.560
 but the extent is how, really the question is,

59:22.560 --> 59:23.840
 how fantastical is it?

59:23.840 --> 59:26.280
 Yeah, like what, you know, a lot of people ask me,

59:26.280 --> 59:27.560
 am I allowed to say this?

59:27.560 --> 59:28.840
 I think I'm allowed to say this.

59:28.840 --> 59:31.560
 I've eaten shrooms a couple of times,

59:31.560 --> 59:33.200
 but I haven't gone the full,

59:33.200 --> 59:35.720
 I'm talking to a few researchers in psychedelics.

59:35.720 --> 59:37.880
 It's an interesting scientifically place.

59:37.880 --> 59:40.520
 Like what is the portal you're entering

59:40.520 --> 59:41.760
 when you take psychedelics?

59:41.760 --> 59:45.240
 Or another way to ask is like dreams.

59:45.240 --> 59:46.760
 So let me tell you what I think,

59:46.760 --> 59:48.440
 which is based on nothing.

59:48.440 --> 59:51.440
 Like this is based on my, right, so I don't.

59:51.440 --> 59:52.400
 Your intuition.

59:52.400 --> 59:56.760
 It's based on my, I'm guessing now,

59:56.760 --> 59:59.320
 based on what I do know, I would say.

59:59.320 --> 1:00:02.400
 But I think that, well, think about what happens.

1:00:02.400 --> 1:00:04.840
 So you're running, your brain's running this internal model

1:00:04.840 --> 1:00:06.680
 and it's all outside of your awareness.

1:00:06.680 --> 1:00:08.280
 You see the, you feel the products,

1:00:08.280 --> 1:00:10.360
 but you don't sense the,

1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:13.680
 you have no awareness of the mechanics of it, right?

1:00:13.680 --> 1:00:17.080
 It's going on all the time.

1:00:17.080 --> 1:00:19.200
 And so one thing that's going on all the time

1:00:19.200 --> 1:00:20.760
 that you're completely unaware of

1:00:20.760 --> 1:00:22.720
 is that when your brain,

1:00:22.720 --> 1:00:25.720
 your brain is basically asking itself,

1:00:25.720 --> 1:00:27.760
 figuratively speaking, not literally, right?

1:00:27.760 --> 1:00:32.160
 Like how is, the last time I was in this sensory array

1:00:32.160 --> 1:00:33.960
 with this stuff going on in my body

1:00:33.960 --> 1:00:37.680
 and this chain of events which just occurred,

1:00:37.680 --> 1:00:39.440
 what did I do next?

1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:40.680
 What did I feel next?

1:00:40.680 --> 1:00:42.000
 What did I see next?

1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:43.600
 It doesn't come up with one answer.

1:00:43.600 --> 1:00:47.360
 It comes up with a distribution of it, possible answers.

1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:50.360
 And then there has to be some selection process.

1:00:50.360 --> 1:00:54.000
 And so you have a network in your brain,

1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:57.560
 a sub network in your brain, a population of neurons

1:00:57.560 --> 1:00:59.680
 that helps to choose.

1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:03.560
 It's not, I'm not talking about a homunculus in your brain

1:01:03.560 --> 1:01:05.600
 or anything silly like that.

1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:08.960
 This is not the soul.

1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:11.800
 It's not the center of yourself or anything like that.

1:01:11.800 --> 1:01:16.800
 But there is a set of neurons

1:01:17.800 --> 1:01:20.800
 that weighs the probabilities

1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:26.640
 and helps to select or narrow the field, okay?

1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:30.120
 And that network is working all the time.

1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:32.160
 It's actually called the control network,

1:01:32.160 --> 1:01:33.520
 the executive control network,

1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:35.840
 or you can call it a frontoparietal

1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:38.160
 because the regions of the brain that make it up

1:01:38.160 --> 1:01:41.120
 are in the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe.

1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:43.120
 There are also parts that belong

1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:44.840
 to the subcortical parts of your brain.

1:01:44.840 --> 1:01:45.680
 It doesn't really matter.

1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:47.680
 The point is that there is this network

1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:49.200
 and it is working all the time.

1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:50.800
 Whether or not you feel in control,

1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:52.680
 whether or not you feel like you're expending effort

1:01:52.680 --> 1:01:53.520
 doesn't really matter.

1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:56.400
 It's on all the time, except when you sleep.

1:01:57.240 --> 1:02:02.080
 When you sleep, it's a little bit relaxed.

1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.640
 And so think about what's happening when you sleep.

1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:09.760
 When you sleep, the external world recedes,

1:02:09.760 --> 1:02:11.400
 the sense data from,

1:02:11.400 --> 1:02:16.000
 so basically your model becomes a little bit,

1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:19.520
 the tethers from the world are loosened.

1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:24.000
 And this network, which is involved in,

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:27.720
 you know, maybe weeding out unrealistic things

1:02:27.720 --> 1:02:29.960
 is a little bit quiet.

1:02:29.960 --> 1:02:34.040
 So use your dreams are really your internal model

1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:40.040
 that's unconstrained by the immediate world.

1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:43.040
 Except, so you can do things that you can't do

1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:45.600
 in real life, in your dreams, right?

1:02:45.600 --> 1:02:46.440
 You can fly.

1:02:46.440 --> 1:02:49.320
 Like I, for example, when I fly on my back in a dream,

1:02:49.320 --> 1:02:51.640
 I'm much faster than when I fly on my front.

1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:53.240
 Don't ask me why, I don't know.

1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:55.000
 Or when you're laying on your back in your dream.

1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:58.720
 No, when I'm in my dream and flying in a dream,

1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:00.800
 I am much faster flyer in the air.

1:03:00.800 --> 1:03:02.040
 You fly often?

1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:04.480
 Not often, but I, You talk about it like you,

1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:06.400
 I don't think I've flown for many years.

1:03:06.400 --> 1:03:08.000
 Well, you must try it.

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:11.480
 I've flown, I've fallen.

1:03:11.480 --> 1:03:12.400
 That's scary.

1:03:12.400 --> 1:03:14.440
 Yeah, but you're talking about like airplane.

1:03:14.440 --> 1:03:16.600
 Yeah, I fly in my dreams.

1:03:16.600 --> 1:03:18.840
 And I'm way faster, right? On your back.

1:03:18.840 --> 1:03:20.320
 On my back, way faster.

1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:22.560
 Now you can say, well, you know,

1:03:22.560 --> 1:03:24.000
 you never flew in your life.

1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:25.720
 Right, it's conceptual combination.

1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:27.680
 I mean, I've flown in an airplane

1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:30.280
 and I've seen birds fly

1:03:30.280 --> 1:03:31.920
 and I've watched movies of people flying

1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:34.280
 and I know Superman probably flies,

1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:36.040
 I don't know if he flies faster on his back, but.

1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:37.880
 He's, I've never seen Superman.

1:03:37.880 --> 1:03:40.040
 He's always flying on his front, right, but yeah.

1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:41.960
 But anyways, my point is that, you know,

1:03:41.960 --> 1:03:46.480
 all of this stuff really, all of these experiences

1:03:46.480 --> 1:03:48.840
 really become part of your internal model.

1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:50.800
 The thing is that when you're asleep,

1:03:52.160 --> 1:03:54.200
 your internal model is still being constrained

1:03:54.200 --> 1:03:56.040
 by your body.

1:03:56.040 --> 1:03:58.520
 Your brain's always attached to your body.

1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:01.040
 It's always receiving sense data from your body.

1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:04.200
 You're mostly never aware of it

1:04:04.200 --> 1:04:06.640
 unless you run up the stairs

1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:11.160
 or, you know, maybe you are ill in some way.

1:04:11.160 --> 1:04:12.720
 But you're mostly not aware of it,

1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:13.800
 which is a really good thing.

1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:16.040
 Because if you were, you know,

1:04:16.040 --> 1:04:17.440
 you'd never pay attention to anything

1:04:17.440 --> 1:04:19.080
 outside your own skin ever again.

1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:20.560
 Like right now, you seem like

1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:21.840
 you're sitting there very calmly,

1:04:21.840 --> 1:04:25.320
 but you have a virtual drama, right?

1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:30.280
 It's like an opera going on inside your body.

1:04:30.280 --> 1:04:33.520
 And so I think that one of the things

1:04:33.520 --> 1:04:37.320
 that happens when people take psilocybin

1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:41.760
 or take, you know, ketamine, for example,

1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:46.760
 is that the tethers are completely removed.

1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:48.840
 Yeah.

1:04:48.840 --> 1:04:50.200
 That's fascinating.

1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:53.480
 And that's why it's helpful to have a guide, right?

1:04:53.480 --> 1:04:57.040
 Because the guide is giving you sense data

1:04:57.040 --> 1:04:59.640
 to steer that internal model

1:04:59.640 --> 1:05:02.560
 so that it doesn't go completely off the rails.

1:05:02.560 --> 1:05:03.400
 Yeah.

1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:06.480
 Again, that wiring to the other brain,

1:05:06.480 --> 1:05:09.840
 that's the guide, is at least a tiny little tether.

1:05:09.840 --> 1:05:10.680
 Exactly.

1:05:10.680 --> 1:05:11.520
 Yeah.

1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:14.960
 Let's talk about emotion a little bit, if we could.

1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:16.960
 Emotion comes up often.

1:05:16.960 --> 1:05:19.280
 And I have never spoken with anybody

1:05:19.280 --> 1:05:24.280
 who has a clarity about emotion

1:05:24.720 --> 1:05:29.200
 from a biological and neuroscience perspective that you do.

1:05:29.200 --> 1:05:34.200
 And I'm not sure I fully know how to,

1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:37.080
 as a, I mentioned this way too much,

1:05:37.080 --> 1:05:40.040
 but as somebody who was born in the Soviet Union

1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:42.440
 and romanticizes basically everything,

1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:44.920
 talks about love nonstop,

1:05:44.920 --> 1:05:48.520
 you know, emotion is a, I don't know what to make of it.

1:05:48.520 --> 1:05:51.080
 I don't know what to,

1:05:51.080 --> 1:05:53.960
 so maybe let's just try to talk about it.

1:05:53.960 --> 1:05:56.440
 I mean, from a neuroscience perspective,

1:05:56.440 --> 1:05:58.440
 we talked about it a little bit last time,

1:05:58.440 --> 1:06:00.720
 your book covers it, how emotions are made,

1:06:00.720 --> 1:06:05.720
 but what are some misconceptions we writers of poetry,

1:06:06.160 --> 1:06:10.200
 we romanticizing humans have about emotion

1:06:10.200 --> 1:06:14.440
 that we should move away from before

1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:18.120
 to think about emotion from both a scientific

1:06:18.120 --> 1:06:20.040
 and an engineering perspective?

1:06:20.040 --> 1:06:25.040
 Yeah, so there is a common view of emotion in the West.

1:06:25.040 --> 1:06:29.080
 The caricature of that view is that,

1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:33.440
 you know, we have an inner beast, right?

1:06:33.440 --> 1:06:37.120
 Your limbic system, your inner lizard,

1:06:38.160 --> 1:06:39.360
 we have an inner beast

1:06:39.360 --> 1:06:41.960
 and that comes baked in to the brain at birth.

1:06:41.960 --> 1:06:44.280
 So you've got circuits for anger, sadness, fear.

1:06:44.280 --> 1:06:46.800
 It's interesting that they all have English names,

1:06:46.800 --> 1:06:47.960
 these circuits.

1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:50.520
 But, and they're there

1:06:50.520 --> 1:06:52.760
 and they're triggered by things in the world.

1:06:52.760 --> 1:06:56.000
 And then they cause you to do and say,

1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:59.280
 and so when your fear circuit is triggered,

1:06:59.280 --> 1:07:03.120
 you widen your eyes, you gasp,

1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:06.680
 your heart rate goes up,

1:07:06.680 --> 1:07:10.960
 you prepare to flee or to freeze.

1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:15.120
 And these are modal responses.

1:07:15.120 --> 1:07:16.840
 They're not the only responses that you give,

1:07:16.840 --> 1:07:19.760
 but on average, they're the prototypical responses.

1:07:20.680 --> 1:07:22.160
 That's the view.

1:07:22.160 --> 1:07:25.880
 And that's the view of emotion in the law.

1:07:25.880 --> 1:07:27.800
 That's the view, you know,

1:07:27.800 --> 1:07:31.120
 that emotions are these profoundly unhelpful things

1:07:31.120 --> 1:07:34.320
 that are obligatory kind of like reflexes.

1:07:37.800 --> 1:07:39.920
 The problem with that view

1:07:39.920 --> 1:07:43.320
 is that it doesn't comport to the evidence.

1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:46.360
 And it doesn't really matter.

1:07:46.360 --> 1:07:49.160
 The evidence actually lines up beautifully with each other.

1:07:49.160 --> 1:07:50.800
 It just doesn't line up with that view.

1:07:50.800 --> 1:07:53.280
 And it doesn't matter whether you're measuring people's faces,

1:07:53.280 --> 1:07:55.280
 facial movements, or you're measuring their body movements,

1:07:55.280 --> 1:07:57.120
 or you're measuring their peripheral physiology,

1:07:57.120 --> 1:07:59.360
 or you're measuring their brains

1:07:59.360 --> 1:08:00.640
 or their voices or whatever.

1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:03.600
 Pick any output that you wanna measure

1:08:03.600 --> 1:08:05.760
 and any system you wanna measure,

1:08:05.760 --> 1:08:09.080
 and you don't really find strong evidence for this.

1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:13.000
 And I say this as somebody who not only has reviewed

1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:17.800
 really thousands of articles and run big meta analyses,

1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:21.280
 which are statistical summaries of published papers,

1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:25.120
 but also as someone who has sent teams of researchers

1:08:25.120 --> 1:08:29.480
 to small scale cultures,

1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:32.520
 you know, remote cultures,

1:08:32.520 --> 1:08:37.480
 which are very different from urban,

1:08:37.480 --> 1:08:40.200
 large scale cultures like ours.

1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:42.760
 And one culture that we visited,

1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:47.200
 and I say we euphemistically because I myself didn't go

1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:49.880
 because I only had two research permits,

1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:52.160
 and I gave them to my students

1:08:52.160 --> 1:08:54.880
 because I felt like it was better for them

1:08:54.880 --> 1:08:56.360
 to have that experience

1:08:56.360 --> 1:08:59.320
 and more formative for them to have that experience.

1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:03.040
 But I was in contact with them every day by satellite phone.

1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:08.040
 And this was to visit the Hadza hunter gatherers in Tanzania

1:09:09.840 --> 1:09:14.840
 who are not an ancient people, they're a modern culture,

1:09:14.840 --> 1:09:19.840
 but they live in circumstances, hunting and foraging,

1:09:19.840 --> 1:09:24.120
 circumstances that are very similar,

1:09:24.120 --> 1:09:26.960
 in similar conditions to our ancestors,

1:09:28.160 --> 1:09:30.640
 hunting gathering ancestors,

1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:34.480
 when expressions of emotion were supposed to have evolved,

1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:37.280
 at least by one view of, okay.

1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:41.200
 So, you know, for many years,

1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:45.600
 I was sort of struggling with this set of observations,

1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:48.240
 which is that I feel emotion,

1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:52.360
 and I perceive emotion in other people,

1:09:52.360 --> 1:09:55.960
 but scientists can't find a single marker,

1:09:55.960 --> 1:09:57.360
 a single biomarker,

1:09:57.360 --> 1:10:01.320
 not a single individual measure or pattern of measures

1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:06.320
 that can predict what kind of emotional state they're in.

1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:08.000
 How could that possibly be?

1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:11.440
 How can you possibly make sense of those two things?

1:10:12.680 --> 1:10:15.840
 And through a lot of reading

1:10:15.840 --> 1:10:19.520
 and a lot of an immersing myself in different literatures,

1:10:19.520 --> 1:10:24.320
 I came to the hypothesis that the brain

1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:26.560
 is constructing these instances

1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:29.320
 out of more basic ingredients.

1:10:29.320 --> 1:10:32.080
 So when I tell you that the brain,

1:10:32.080 --> 1:10:34.080
 when I suggest to you that what your brain is doing

1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:37.000
 is making a prediction,

1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:41.000
 and it's asking itself, figuratively speaking,

1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.640
 the last time I was in this situation

1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:46.440
 and this, you know, physical state,

1:10:46.440 --> 1:10:47.600
 what did I do next?

1:10:47.600 --> 1:10:48.600
 What did I see next?

1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:50.040
 What did I hear next?

1:10:50.040 --> 1:10:53.520
 It's basically asking what in my past

1:10:53.520 --> 1:10:57.280
 is similar to the present?

1:10:59.120 --> 1:11:01.360
 Things which are similar to one another

1:11:02.520 --> 1:11:03.960
 are called a category.

1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:05.240
 A group of things which are similar

1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:07.200
 to one another is a category.

1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:11.360
 And a mental representation of a category is a concept.

1:11:12.360 --> 1:11:15.160
 So your brain is constructing categories or concepts

1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:17.360
 on the fly continuously.

1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:19.760
 So you really want to understand what a brain is doing.

1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:23.160
 You don't, using machine learning like classification models

1:11:23.160 --> 1:11:24.160
 is not going to help you

1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:25.840
 because the brain doesn't classify.

1:11:25.840 --> 1:11:28.080
 It's doing category construction.

1:11:29.080 --> 1:11:31.480
 And the categories change,

1:11:31.480 --> 1:11:34.000
 or you could say it's doing concept construction.

1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:37.920
 It's using past experience to conjure a concept,

1:11:37.920 --> 1:11:39.440
 which is a prediction.

1:11:41.880 --> 1:11:45.840
 And if it's using past experiences of emotion,

1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:48.400
 then it's constructing an emotion concept.

1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:54.480
 Your concept will be,

1:11:54.480 --> 1:12:01.480
 the content of it changes

1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:03.160
 depending on the situation that you're in.

1:12:03.160 --> 1:12:06.880
 So for example, if your brain uses past experiences of anger

1:12:06.880 --> 1:12:10.040
 that you have learned,

1:12:10.040 --> 1:12:13.480
 either because somebody labeled them for you,

1:12:13.480 --> 1:12:17.560
 taught them to you, you observed them in movies and so on,

1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:20.320
 in one situation could be very different

1:12:20.320 --> 1:12:24.280
 from your concept of for anger than another situation.

1:12:24.280 --> 1:12:29.280
 And this is how anger, instances of anger are,

1:12:29.280 --> 1:12:32.520
 we call a population of variable instances.

1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:34.800
 Sometimes when you're angry, you scowl.

1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:38.760
 Sometimes when you're angry, you might smile.

1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:42.080
 Sometimes when you're angry, you might cry.

1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:44.840
 Sometimes your heart rate will go up, it will go down,

1:12:44.840 --> 1:12:46.200
 it will stay the same.

1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:49.040
 It depends on what action you're about to take

1:12:49.040 --> 1:12:51.640
 because the way prediction, and I should say,

1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:56.640
 the idea that physiology is yoked to action

1:12:56.640 --> 1:13:00.160
 is a very old idea in the study

1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:01.520
 of the peripheral nervous system

1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:03.600
 that's been known for really decades.

1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:07.280
 And so if you look at what the brain is doing,

1:13:07.280 --> 1:13:09.800
 if you just look at the anatomy and you,

1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:12.520
 here's the hypothesis that you would come up with.

1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:14.320
 And I can go into the details.

1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:18.040
 I've published these details in scientific papers

1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:20.680
 and they also appear somewhat in

1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:22.400
 How Emotions Were Made, my first book.

1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:25.360
 They are not in the seven and a half lessons

1:13:25.360 --> 1:13:29.680
 because that book is really not pitched

1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:31.800
 at that level of explanation.

1:13:31.800 --> 1:13:35.480
 It's just giving, it's really just a set of little essays.

1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:38.680
 But the evidence, but what I'm about to say

1:13:38.680 --> 1:13:41.880
 is actually based on scientific evidence.

1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:46.280
 When your brain begins to form a prediction,

1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:51.280
 the first thing it's doing is it's making a prediction

1:13:51.280 --> 1:13:54.800
 of how to change the internal systems of your body,

1:13:54.800 --> 1:13:56.920
 your heart, your cardiovascular system,

1:13:56.920 --> 1:13:59.560
 the control of your heart, control of your lungs,

1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:03.800
 a flush of cortisol, which is not a stress hormone.

1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:05.360
 It's a hormone that gets glucose

1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:08.200
 into your bloodstream very fast

1:14:08.200 --> 1:14:10.800
 because your brain is predicting you need to do this.

1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:13.200
 Predicting you need to do something

1:14:13.200 --> 1:14:17.560
 metabolically expensive.

1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:23.600
 And so either that means either move or learn, okay?

1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:28.400
 And so your brain is preparing your body,

1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:30.480
 the internal systems of your body

1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:34.200
 to execute some actions, to move in some way.

1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:39.200
 And then it infers based on those motor predictions

1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:45.160
 and what we call viscera motor predictions,

1:14:45.160 --> 1:14:48.760
 meaning the changes in the viscera

1:14:48.760 --> 1:14:52.280
 that your brain is preparing to execute,

1:14:54.200 --> 1:14:59.200
 your brain makes an inference about what you will sense

1:14:59.640 --> 1:15:01.600
 based on those motor movements.

1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:05.440
 So your experience of the world

1:15:05.440 --> 1:15:08.200
 and your experience of your own body

1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:13.800
 are a consequence of those predictions, those concepts.

1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:16.800
 When your brain makes a concept for emotion,

1:15:16.800 --> 1:15:21.680
 it's constructing an instance of that emotion.

1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:24.240
 And that is how emotions are made.

1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:27.440
 And those concepts load in,

1:15:27.440 --> 1:15:32.440
 the predictions that are made include contents

1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:36.560
 inside the body, contents outside the body.

1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:38.400
 I mean, it includes other humans.

1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:42.120
 So just this construction of a concept

1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:46.160
 includes the variables that are much richer

1:15:46.160 --> 1:15:51.160
 than just some sort of simple notion.

1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:53.440
 Yeah, so our colloquial notion of a concept

1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:58.440
 where I say, well, what's a concept of a bird?

1:16:00.680 --> 1:16:02.800
 And then you list a set of features off to me.

1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:04.760
 That's people's understanding,

1:16:04.760 --> 1:16:05.920
 typically of what a concept is.

1:16:05.920 --> 1:16:10.920
 But if you go into the literature in cognitive science,

1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:13.080
 what you'll see is that the way

1:16:13.080 --> 1:16:15.760
 that scientists have understood what a concept is

1:16:15.760 --> 1:16:17.520
 has really changed over the years.

1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:19.720
 So people used to think about a concept

1:16:19.720 --> 1:16:24.320
 as philosophers and scientists used to think about a concept

1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:27.400
 as a dictionary definition for a category.

1:16:27.400 --> 1:16:29.600
 So there's a set of things which are similar

1:16:29.600 --> 1:16:31.280
 out in the world.

1:16:31.280 --> 1:16:36.280
 And your concept for that category

1:16:36.440 --> 1:16:39.440
 is a dictionary definition of the features,

1:16:39.440 --> 1:16:43.120
 the necessary insufficient features of those instances.

1:16:43.120 --> 1:16:47.680
 So for a bird, it would be.

1:16:47.680 --> 1:16:50.800
 Wings, feathers. Right, a beak.

1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:53.360
 It flies, whatever, okay.

1:16:53.360 --> 1:16:55.680
 That's called the classical category.

1:16:55.680 --> 1:16:58.160
 And scientists discovered, observed

1:16:58.160 --> 1:17:02.840
 that actually not all instances of birds have feathers

1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:05.680
 and not all instances of birds fly.

1:17:05.680 --> 1:17:08.400
 And so the idea was that you don't have

1:17:08.400 --> 1:17:11.840
 a single representation of necessary insufficient features

1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:13.000
 stored in your brain somewhere.

1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:15.840
 Instead, what you have is a prototype,

1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:18.400
 a prototype meaning you still have

1:17:18.400 --> 1:17:20.960
 a single representation for the category, one,

1:17:22.320 --> 1:17:27.240
 but the features are like of the most typical instance

1:17:27.240 --> 1:17:29.600
 of the category or maybe the most frequent instance,

1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:31.560
 but not all instances of the category

1:17:31.560 --> 1:17:33.200
 have all the features, right?

1:17:33.200 --> 1:17:36.600
 They have some graded similarity to the prototype.

1:17:38.640 --> 1:17:42.880
 And then, you know,

1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:47.880
 what I'm gonna like incredibly simplify now,

1:17:48.440 --> 1:17:52.360
 a lot of work to say that then a series of experiments

1:17:52.360 --> 1:17:55.200
 were done to show that in fact,

1:17:56.040 --> 1:17:58.600
 what your brain seems to be doing is coming up

1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:03.600
 with a single exemplar or instance of the category

1:18:03.760 --> 1:18:08.760
 and reading off the features

1:18:08.760 --> 1:18:11.000
 when I ask you for the concept.

1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:16.000
 So if we were in a pet store and I asked you

1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:20.000
 what are the features of a bird,

1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:21.880
 tell me the concept of bird,

1:18:21.880 --> 1:18:25.920
 you would be more likely to give me features of a good pet.

1:18:26.840 --> 1:18:29.240
 And if we were in a restaurant,

1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:31.840
 you would be more likely, you know, like a budgie, right?

1:18:31.840 --> 1:18:32.960
 Or a canary.

1:18:32.960 --> 1:18:34.080
 If we were in a restaurant,

1:18:34.080 --> 1:18:36.560
 you would be more likely to give me the features

1:18:36.560 --> 1:18:39.240
 of a bird that you would eat, like a chicken.

1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:40.320
 And if we were in a park,

1:18:40.320 --> 1:18:45.320
 you'd be more likely to give me in this country,

1:18:46.040 --> 1:18:49.240
 you know, the features of a sparrow or a robin.

1:18:49.240 --> 1:18:50.640
 Whereas if we were in South America,

1:18:50.640 --> 1:18:54.560
 you would probably give me the features of a peacock

1:18:54.560 --> 1:18:56.280
 because that's more common

1:18:57.200 --> 1:18:59.240
 or it is more common there than here

1:18:59.240 --> 1:19:01.520
 that you would see a peacock in such circumstances.

1:19:01.520 --> 1:19:06.520
 So the idea was that really what your brain was doing

1:19:06.520 --> 1:19:11.520
 was conjuring a concept on the fly

1:19:12.240 --> 1:19:16.720
 that meets the function that the category is being put to.

1:19:18.440 --> 1:19:19.280
 Okay?

1:19:19.280 --> 1:19:20.120
 Okay.

1:19:21.360 --> 1:19:26.360
 Then people started studying ad hoc concepts,

1:19:27.280 --> 1:19:32.280
 meaning concepts where the instances don't share

1:19:32.280 --> 1:19:37.280
 any physical features, but the function of the instances

1:19:39.200 --> 1:19:40.320
 are the same.

1:19:40.320 --> 1:19:42.360
 So for example, think about all the things

1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:44.880
 that can protect you from the rain.

1:19:46.200 --> 1:19:49.080
 What are all the things that can protect you from the rain?

1:19:49.080 --> 1:19:54.080
 Umbrella, like this apartment.

1:19:54.320 --> 1:19:55.160
 Right.

1:19:56.720 --> 1:19:57.560
 Your car.

1:19:57.560 --> 1:19:59.200
 Not giving a damn.

1:19:59.200 --> 1:20:03.440
 Like a mindset.

1:20:03.440 --> 1:20:05.360
 Yeah, right, right.

1:20:05.360 --> 1:20:08.920
 So the idea is that the function of the instances

1:20:08.920 --> 1:20:11.400
 is the same in a given situation.

1:20:11.400 --> 1:20:13.800
 Even if they look different, sound different,

1:20:13.800 --> 1:20:17.880
 smell different, this is called an abstract concept

1:20:17.880 --> 1:20:21.560
 or a conceptual concept.

1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:27.240
 Now the really cool thing about conceptual categories

1:20:27.240 --> 1:20:31.800
 or conceptual category is a category of things

1:20:31.800 --> 1:20:35.400
 that are held together by a function,

1:20:35.400 --> 1:20:37.240
 which is called an abstract concept

1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:39.000
 or a conceptual category,

1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:41.600
 because the things don't share physical features,

1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:44.000
 they share functional features.

1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:46.160
 There are two really cool things about this.

1:20:46.160 --> 1:20:50.280
 One is that's what Darwin said a species was.

1:20:50.280 --> 1:20:55.280
 So Darwin is known for discovering natural selection.

1:20:59.720 --> 1:21:02.280
 But the other thing he really did,

1:21:02.280 --> 1:21:06.400
 which was really profound, which he's less celebrated for,

1:21:06.400 --> 1:21:10.520
 is understanding that all biological categories

1:21:10.520 --> 1:21:15.000
 have inherent variation, inherent variation.

1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:19.160
 Darwin wrote in The Origin of Species

1:21:19.160 --> 1:21:22.280
 about before Darwin's book,

1:21:22.280 --> 1:21:27.280
 a species was thought to be a classical category

1:21:27.440 --> 1:21:30.760
 where all the instances of dogs were the same,

1:21:30.760 --> 1:21:32.200
 had the exactly same features,

1:21:32.200 --> 1:21:37.200
 and any variation from that perfect platonic instance

1:21:39.600 --> 1:21:41.400
 was considered to be error.

1:21:41.400 --> 1:21:44.920
 And Darwin said, no, it's not error, it's meaningful.

1:21:44.920 --> 1:21:49.920
 So nature selects on the basis of that variation.

1:21:52.200 --> 1:21:56.040
 The reason why natural selection is powerful and can exist

1:21:56.040 --> 1:21:59.880
 is because there is variation in a species.

1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:03.960
 And in dogs, we talk about that variation

1:22:03.960 --> 1:22:06.040
 in terms of the size of the dog

1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:09.640
 and the amount of fur the dog has and the color

1:22:09.640 --> 1:22:12.840
 and how long is the tail and how long is the snout.

1:22:12.840 --> 1:22:16.200
 In humans, we talk about that variation

1:22:16.200 --> 1:22:20.720
 in all kinds of ways, right, including in cultural ways.

1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:25.680
 So that's one thing that's really interesting

1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:28.200
 about conceptual categories is that Darwin

1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:31.520
 is basically saying a species is a conceptual category.

1:22:31.520 --> 1:22:34.640
 And in fact, if you look at modern debates

1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:38.360
 about what is a species, you can't find anybody

1:22:38.360 --> 1:22:43.040
 agreeing on what the criteria are for a species,

1:22:43.040 --> 1:22:45.280
 because they don't all share the same genome.

1:22:46.320 --> 1:22:47.720
 We don't all share, we don't,

1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:49.800
 there isn't a single human genome.

1:22:49.800 --> 1:22:54.800
 There's a population of genomes, but they're variable.

1:22:56.200 --> 1:23:00.640
 It's not unbounded variation, but they are variable, right?

1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:03.000
 And the other thing that's really cool

1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:08.000
 about conceptual categories is that they are the categories

1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:13.960
 that we use to make civilization.

1:23:15.160 --> 1:23:18.000
 So think about money, for example.

1:23:19.200 --> 1:23:21.760
 What are all the physical things

1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:25.520
 that make something a currency?

1:23:25.520 --> 1:23:28.680
 Is there any physical feature that all the currencies

1:23:28.680 --> 1:23:33.540
 in all the worlds that's ever been used by humans share?

1:23:33.540 --> 1:23:36.600
 Well, certainly, right, but what is it?

1:23:36.600 --> 1:23:38.440
 Is it definable?

1:23:38.440 --> 1:23:43.080
 So it's getting to the point that you make this function.

1:23:43.080 --> 1:23:44.680
 It's the function, right.

1:23:44.680 --> 1:23:47.200
 It's that we trade it for material goods.

1:23:47.200 --> 1:23:49.000
 And we have to agree, right?

1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:52.680
 We all impose on whatever it is, salt, barley,

1:23:52.680 --> 1:23:55.480
 little shells, big rocks in the ocean that can't move,

1:23:55.480 --> 1:23:58.240
 Bitcoin, pieces of plastic, mortgages,

1:23:58.240 --> 1:24:00.720
 which are basically a promise of something in the future,

1:24:00.720 --> 1:24:02.280
 nothing more, right?

1:24:02.280 --> 1:24:06.240
 All of these things, we impose value on them.

1:24:06.240 --> 1:24:09.680
 And we all agree that we can exchange them

1:24:09.680 --> 1:24:11.200
 for material goods.

1:24:11.200 --> 1:24:13.840
 Yeah, and yes, that's brilliant.

1:24:13.840 --> 1:24:16.040
 By the way, you're attributing some of that to Darwin,

1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:16.880
 that he thought.

1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:18.440
 No, no, I'm saying that what Darwin.

1:24:18.440 --> 1:24:19.480
 Because it's a brilliant view

1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:21.720
 of what a species is, is the function.

1:24:21.720 --> 1:24:24.480
 Yeah, what I'm saying is that what Darwin,

1:24:24.480 --> 1:24:28.280
 Darwin really talked about variation in,

1:24:28.280 --> 1:24:29.320
 so if you read, for example,

1:24:29.320 --> 1:24:31.160
 the biologist Ernst Mayr,

1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:33.280
 who was an evolutionary biologist,

1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:34.440
 and then when he retired,

1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:38.400
 became a historian and philosopher of biology.

1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:42.960
 And his suggestion is that Darwin,

1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:45.640
 Darwin did talk about variation.

1:24:45.640 --> 1:24:48.080
 He vanquished what's called essentialism,

1:24:48.080 --> 1:24:51.960
 the idea that there's a single set of features

1:24:51.960 --> 1:24:54.840
 that define any species.

1:24:56.080 --> 1:25:01.080
 And out of that grew really discussions

1:25:02.840 --> 1:25:07.160
 of some of the functional features that species have,

1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:10.680
 like they can reproduce, they can have offspring,

1:25:10.680 --> 1:25:12.720
 the individuals of a species can have offspring.

1:25:12.720 --> 1:25:16.720
 It turns out that's not a perfect criterion to use,

1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:20.680
 but it's a functional criterion, right?

1:25:20.680 --> 1:25:23.040
 So what I'm saying is that in cognitive science,

1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:24.640
 people came up with the idea,

1:25:24.640 --> 1:25:26.960
 they discovered the idea of conceptual categories

1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:30.880
 or ad hoc concepts, these concepts that can change

1:25:30.880 --> 1:25:33.440
 based on the function they're serving, right?

1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:38.440
 And that it's there, it's in Darwin,

1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:42.240
 and it's also in the philosophy of social reality.

1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:44.880
 The way that philosophers talk about social reality,

1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:46.200
 just look around you.

1:25:46.200 --> 1:25:47.800
 I mean, we impose,

1:25:47.800 --> 1:25:49.840
 we're treating a bunch of things as similar,

1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:52.040
 which are physically different.

1:25:52.040 --> 1:25:55.920
 And sometimes we take things that are physically the same

1:25:55.920 --> 1:25:58.360
 and we treat them as separate categories.

1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:02.280
 But it feels like the number of variables involved

1:26:02.280 --> 1:26:04.840
 in that kind of categorization is nearly infinite.

1:26:04.840 --> 1:26:06.160
 No, I don't think so,

1:26:06.160 --> 1:26:08.560
 because there is a physical constraint, right?

1:26:08.560 --> 1:26:13.560
 Like you and I could agree that we can fly in real life,

1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:14.800
 but we can't.

1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:18.840
 That's a physical constraint that we can't break, right?

1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:21.520
 You and I could agree that we could walk through the walls,

1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:22.400
 but we can't.

1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:24.200
 We could agree that we could eat glass,

1:26:24.200 --> 1:26:25.040
 but we can't.

1:26:25.040 --> 1:26:25.880
 Oh, there's a lot of constraints, but I just.

1:26:25.880 --> 1:26:28.720
 Yeah, we could agree that the virus doesn't exist

1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:30.320
 and we don't have to wear masks.

1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:33.040
 Right, yeah.

1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:37.240
 But physical reality still holds the Trump card, right?

1:26:37.240 --> 1:26:38.080
 But still there's a lot of.

1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:41.560
 The Trump card, well, pun unintended.

1:26:41.560 --> 1:26:43.160
 Pun completely unintended, but there you go,

1:26:43.160 --> 1:26:44.960
 that's a predicting brain for you.

1:26:44.960 --> 1:26:49.600
 But there is a tremendous amount of leeway.

1:26:49.600 --> 1:26:50.440
 Yes.

1:26:50.440 --> 1:26:51.600
 Yeah, that's the point.

1:26:51.600 --> 1:26:54.520
 So what I'm saying is that emotions are like money.

1:26:55.680 --> 1:26:59.000
 Basically, they're like money, they're like countries,

1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:02.360
 they're like kings and queens and presidents.

1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:05.200
 They're like everything that we construct

1:27:05.200 --> 1:27:07.320
 that we impose meaning on.

1:27:07.320 --> 1:27:10.480
 We take these physical signals and we give them meanings

1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:13.840
 that they don't otherwise have by their physical nature.

1:27:13.840 --> 1:27:18.840
 And because we agree, they have that function.

1:27:19.360 --> 1:27:23.000
 But the beautiful thing, so maybe unlike money,

1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:26.680
 I love this similarity is it's not obvious to me

1:27:26.680 --> 1:27:29.440
 that this kind of emergent agreement

1:27:29.440 --> 1:27:31.120
 should happen with emotion,

1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:33.320
 because our experiences are so different

1:27:33.320 --> 1:27:36.600
 for each of us humans, and yet we kind of converge.

1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:39.760
 Well, in a culture we converge, but not across cultures.

1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:41.680
 There are huge, huge differences.

1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:44.960
 There are huge differences in what concepts exist,

1:27:44.960 --> 1:27:48.480
 what they look like.

1:27:48.480 --> 1:27:53.480
 So what I would say is that what we're doing

1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:59.000
 with our young children as their brains become wired

1:28:00.120 --> 1:28:03.840
 to their physical and their social environment

1:28:03.840 --> 1:28:05.960
 is that we are curating for them.

1:28:05.960 --> 1:28:07.920
 We are bootstrapping into their brains

1:28:07.920 --> 1:28:11.600
 a set of emotion concepts.

1:28:11.600 --> 1:28:13.000
 That's partly what they're learning.

1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:15.080
 And we curate those for infants

1:28:15.080 --> 1:28:17.240
 just the way we curate for them what is a dog,

1:28:17.240 --> 1:28:19.640
 what is a cat, what is a truck.

1:28:19.640 --> 1:28:22.360
 We sometimes explicitly label

1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:25.160
 and we sometimes just use mental words.

1:28:26.200 --> 1:28:30.640
 When your kid is throwing Cheerios on the floor

1:28:30.640 --> 1:28:33.680
 instead of eating them, or your kid is crying

1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:37.400
 when she won't put herself to sleep or whatever.

1:28:37.400 --> 1:28:39.360
 We use mental words.

1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:44.000
 And a word is this, words for infants,

1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.560
 words are these really special things

1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:49.320
 that they help infants learn abstract categories.

1:28:49.320 --> 1:28:54.320
 There's a huge literature showing that children can take

1:28:54.320 --> 1:28:56.400
 things that don't look infants,

1:28:56.400 --> 1:28:58.840
 like infants, really young infants,

1:28:58.840 --> 1:29:03.080
 preverbal infants can take, if you label,

1:29:03.080 --> 1:29:07.000
 if I say to you, and you're an infant, okay?

1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:12.000
 So I say, Lexi, this is a bling.

1:29:13.440 --> 1:29:17.080
 And I put it down and the bling makes a squeaky noise.

1:29:17.080 --> 1:29:22.080
 And then I say, Lexi, this is a bling.

1:29:22.080 --> 1:29:24.760
 And I put it down and it makes a squeaky noise.

1:29:24.760 --> 1:29:29.760
 And then I say, Lexi, this is a bling.

1:29:30.720 --> 1:29:34.120
 You, as young as four months old,

1:29:34.120 --> 1:29:39.120
 will expect this to make a noise, a squeaky noise.

1:29:39.520 --> 1:29:41.920
 And if you don't, if it doesn't, you'll be surprised

1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:44.680
 because it violated your expectation, right?

1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:49.680
 I'm building for you an internal model of a bling.

1:29:49.680 --> 1:29:53.200
 Okay, infants can do this really, really at a young age.

1:29:53.200 --> 1:29:55.600
 And so there's no reason to believe

1:29:55.600 --> 1:29:58.440
 that they couldn't learn emotion categories

1:29:58.440 --> 1:29:59.680
 and concepts in the same way.

1:29:59.680 --> 1:30:04.320
 And what happens when you go to a new culture?

1:30:04.320 --> 1:30:05.720
 When you go to a new culture,

1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:11.320
 you have to do what's called emotion acculturation.

1:30:11.320 --> 1:30:13.680
 So my colleague Bacha Mesquita in Belgium

1:30:13.680 --> 1:30:15.080
 studies emotion acculturation.

1:30:15.080 --> 1:30:16.560
 She studies how, when people move

1:30:16.560 --> 1:30:18.080
 from one culture to another,

1:30:18.080 --> 1:30:21.720
 how do they learn the emotion concepts of that culture?

1:30:21.720 --> 1:30:23.440
 How do they learn to make sense

1:30:23.440 --> 1:30:25.920
 of their own internal sensations

1:30:25.920 --> 1:30:29.640
 and also the movements, the raise of an eyebrow,

1:30:29.640 --> 1:30:30.560
 the tilt of a head?

1:30:30.560 --> 1:30:34.640
 How do they learn to make sense of cues from other people

1:30:34.640 --> 1:30:37.760
 using concepts they don't have,

1:30:37.760 --> 1:30:40.600
 but have to make on the fly?

1:30:40.600 --> 1:30:43.240
 So that's the difference between cultures.

1:30:43.240 --> 1:30:45.200
 Let me open another door.

1:30:45.200 --> 1:30:46.400
 I'm not sure I wanna open,

1:30:46.400 --> 1:30:49.320
 but the difference between men and women.

1:30:49.320 --> 1:30:53.840
 Is there a difference between the emotional lives

1:30:53.840 --> 1:30:57.180
 of those two categories of biological systems?

1:30:57.180 --> 1:31:00.300
 So here's what I would say.

1:31:00.300 --> 1:31:04.740
 We did a series of studies in the 1990s

1:31:04.740 --> 1:31:07.300
 where we asked men and women

1:31:07.300 --> 1:31:10.020
 to tell us about their emotional lives.

1:31:10.020 --> 1:31:11.340
 And women described themselves

1:31:11.340 --> 1:31:13.620
 as much more emotional than men.

1:31:13.620 --> 1:31:15.460
 They believed that they were more emotional than men

1:31:15.460 --> 1:31:17.140
 and men agreed.

1:31:17.140 --> 1:31:19.580
 Women are much more emotional than men.

1:31:19.580 --> 1:31:24.260
 And then we gave them little handheld computers.

1:31:24.260 --> 1:31:26.340
 These were little Hewlett Packard computers.

1:31:26.340 --> 1:31:28.860
 They fit in the palm of your hand.

1:31:28.860 --> 1:31:29.700
 They weighed a couple of pounds.

1:31:29.700 --> 1:31:31.680
 So this was like pre palm pilot even,

1:31:31.680 --> 1:31:36.680
 like this was 1990s and like early.

1:31:36.740 --> 1:31:41.540
 And we asked them,

1:31:41.540 --> 1:31:45.780
 we would ping them like 10 times a day

1:31:45.780 --> 1:31:48.900
 and just ask them to report how they were feeling,

1:31:48.900 --> 1:31:50.820
 which is called experience sampling.

1:31:51.920 --> 1:31:53.940
 So we experienced sampled.

1:31:53.940 --> 1:31:57.760
 And then at the end,

1:31:57.760 --> 1:31:59.420
 and then we looked at their reports

1:31:59.420 --> 1:32:01.060
 and what we found is that men and women

1:32:01.060 --> 1:32:02.500
 basically didn't differ.

1:32:02.500 --> 1:32:05.540
 And there were some people who were really,

1:32:05.540 --> 1:32:07.780
 had many more instances of emotion.

1:32:07.780 --> 1:32:12.780
 So they were treading water in a tumultuous sea of emotion.

1:32:15.980 --> 1:32:17.360
 And then there were other people

1:32:17.360 --> 1:32:21.060
 who were like floating tranquilly in a lake.

1:32:21.060 --> 1:32:23.060
 It was really not perturbed very often.

1:32:23.060 --> 1:32:25.160
 And everyone in between,

1:32:25.160 --> 1:32:28.260
 but there were no difference between men and women.

1:32:28.260 --> 1:32:30.220
 And the really interesting thing is at the end

1:32:30.220 --> 1:32:32.720
 of the sampling period, we asked people,

1:32:33.580 --> 1:32:36.800
 so reflect over the past two weeks and tell it.

1:32:36.800 --> 1:32:39.700
 So we've been now pinging people like again

1:32:39.700 --> 1:32:41.140
 and again and again, right?

1:32:41.140 --> 1:32:44.120
 So tell us how emotional do you think you are?

1:32:44.120 --> 1:32:45.440
 No change from the beginning.

1:32:45.440 --> 1:32:50.440
 So men and women believe that they are different.

1:32:50.440 --> 1:32:53.360
 And when they are looking at other people,

1:32:53.360 --> 1:32:56.880
 they make different inferences about emotion.

1:32:56.880 --> 1:32:59.400
 If a man is scowling,

1:32:59.400 --> 1:33:01.080
 like if you and I were together

1:33:01.080 --> 1:33:04.520
 and so somebody is watching this, okay?

1:33:04.520 --> 1:33:07.360
 And yeah, hey, who are you saying?

1:33:07.360 --> 1:33:08.200
 Hey, hi.

1:33:08.200 --> 1:33:09.040
 Yeah, hi.

1:33:09.840 --> 1:33:12.440
 By the way, people love it when you look at the camera.

1:33:15.480 --> 1:33:20.320
 If you and I make exactly the same set of facial movements,

1:33:20.320 --> 1:33:25.320
 when people look at you, both men and women look at you,

1:33:25.920 --> 1:33:27.760
 they are more likely to think,

1:33:27.760 --> 1:33:30.720
 oh, he's reacting to the situation.

1:33:30.720 --> 1:33:33.320
 And when they look at me, they'll say,

1:33:33.320 --> 1:33:34.680
 oh, she's having an emotion.

1:33:34.680 --> 1:33:36.380
 She's, you know, yeah.

1:33:36.380 --> 1:33:38.000
 And I wrote about this actually

1:33:40.380 --> 1:33:45.380
 right before the 2016 election.

1:33:46.620 --> 1:33:49.220
 You know what, maybe I could confess.

1:33:49.220 --> 1:33:51.680
 Let me try to carefully confess.

1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:53.040
 But you are really gonna.

1:33:53.040 --> 1:33:57.560
 Yeah, that when I,

1:33:57.560 --> 1:34:01.240
 that there is an element when I see Hillary Clinton

1:34:02.440 --> 1:34:06.880
 that there was something annoying about her to me.

1:34:06.880 --> 1:34:09.400
 And I, just that feeling,

1:34:09.400 --> 1:34:13.960
 and then I tried to reduce that to what is that?

1:34:13.960 --> 1:34:17.320
 Because I think the same attributes

1:34:17.320 --> 1:34:19.560
 that are annoying about her

1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:22.040
 when I see in other people wouldn't be annoying.

1:34:22.040 --> 1:34:25.000
 So I was trying to understand what is it?

1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:28.000
 Because it certainly does feel like that concept

1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:30.080
 that I've constructed in my mind.

1:34:30.080 --> 1:34:32.160
 Well, I'll tell you that I think,

1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:35.920
 well, let me just say that what you would predict about,

1:34:35.920 --> 1:34:39.040
 for example, the performance of the two of them

1:34:39.040 --> 1:34:42.000
 in the debates, and I wrote an op ed

1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:46.320
 for the New York Times actually before the second debate.

1:34:46.320 --> 1:34:48.640
 And it played out really pretty much

1:34:48.640 --> 1:34:51.200
 as I thought that it would based on research.

1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:53.220
 It's not like I'm like a great fortune teller or anything.

1:34:53.220 --> 1:34:54.560
 It's just, I was just applying the research,

1:34:54.560 --> 1:34:57.240
 which was that when a woman,

1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:03.200
 a woman's, people make internal attributions, it's called.

1:35:03.200 --> 1:35:07.160
 They infer that the facial movements and body posture

1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:10.580
 and vocalizations of a woman reflect her interstate.

1:35:10.580 --> 1:35:12.880
 But for a man, they're more likely to assume

1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:15.260
 that they reflect his response to the situation.

1:35:15.260 --> 1:35:16.440
 It doesn't say anything about him.

1:35:16.440 --> 1:35:19.120
 It says something about the situation he's in.

1:35:19.120 --> 1:35:22.920
 Now, for the thing that you were describing

1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:27.840
 about Hillary Clinton, I think a lot of people experienced,

1:35:27.840 --> 1:35:30.640
 but it's also in line with research, which shows,

1:35:30.640 --> 1:35:32.560
 and particularly research actually

1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:36.160
 about teaching evaluations is one place

1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:39.600
 that you really see it, where the expectation

1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:42.080
 is that a woman will be nurturant

1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:46.160
 and that a man, there's just no expectation

1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:47.280
 for him to be nurturant.

1:35:47.280 --> 1:35:50.760
 So if he is nurturant, he gets points.

1:35:51.960 --> 1:35:54.200
 If he's not, he gets points.

1:35:54.200 --> 1:35:56.000
 They're just different points, right?

1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.440
 Whereas for a woman, especially a woman

1:35:58.440 --> 1:36:02.440
 who's an authority figure, she's really in a catch 22.

1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:05.400
 Because if she's serious, she's a bitch.

1:36:05.400 --> 1:36:09.480
 And if she's empathic, then she's weak.

1:36:09.480 --> 1:36:12.920
 Right, that's brilliant. I mean, one of the bigger questions

1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:15.320
 to ask here, so that's one example

1:36:15.320 --> 1:36:20.320
 where our construction of concepts gets in trouble.

1:36:20.640 --> 1:36:24.240
 So, but remember I said science and philosophy

1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:26.000
 are like tools for living.

1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:30.440
 So I learned recently that if you ask me

1:36:30.440 --> 1:36:34.240
 what is my intuition about what regulates my eating,

1:36:34.240 --> 1:36:36.340
 I will say carbohydrates.

1:36:36.340 --> 1:36:37.480
 I love carbohydrates.

1:36:37.480 --> 1:36:38.480
 I love pasta.

1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:39.320
 I love bread.

1:36:39.320 --> 1:36:42.200
 I love, I just love carbohydrates.

1:36:42.200 --> 1:36:45.960
 But actually research shows, and it's beautiful research.

1:36:45.960 --> 1:36:49.160
 I love this research because it so violates my own

1:36:49.160 --> 1:36:52.720
 like deeply, deeply held beliefs about myself

1:36:53.840 --> 1:36:57.480
 that most animals on this planet who have been studied

1:36:57.480 --> 1:37:00.640
 and there are many actually eat

1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:02.500
 to regulate their protein intake.

1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:06.440
 So you will overeat carbohydrates

1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:10.000
 if you, in order to get enough protein.

1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.320
 And this research has been done with human,

1:37:12.320 --> 1:37:15.780
 very beautiful research with humans, with crickets,

1:37:15.780 --> 1:37:17.280
 with like, you know, bonobos.

1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:19.200
 I mean, just like all these different animals, not bonobos,

1:37:19.200 --> 1:37:20.500
 but I think like baboons.

1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:24.580
 Now that I have no intuition about that.

1:37:24.580 --> 1:37:27.800
 And I, even now as I regulate my eating,

1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:30.500
 I still, I just have no intuition.

1:37:30.500 --> 1:37:32.800
 It just, I can't feel it.

1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:35.800
 What I feel is only about the carbohydrates.

1:37:35.800 --> 1:37:38.040
 It feels like you're regulating around carbohydrates,

1:37:38.040 --> 1:37:38.880
 not the protein.

1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:41.100
 Yeah, but in fact, actually what I am doing,

1:37:41.100 --> 1:37:43.920
 if I am like most animals on the planet,

1:37:43.920 --> 1:37:45.240
 I am regulating around protein.

1:37:45.240 --> 1:37:48.440
 So knowing this, what do I do?

1:37:48.440 --> 1:37:51.580
 I correct my behavior to eat,

1:37:51.580 --> 1:37:56.260
 to actually deliberately try to focus on the protein.

1:37:56.260 --> 1:38:00.140
 This is the idea behind bias training, right?

1:38:00.140 --> 1:38:01.820
 Like if you,

1:38:01.820 --> 1:38:06.820
 I also did not experience Hillary Clinton

1:38:09.700 --> 1:38:12.820
 as the warmest candidate.

1:38:12.820 --> 1:38:17.820
 However, you can use consistent science,

1:38:19.780 --> 1:38:21.340
 since the consistent scientific findings

1:38:21.340 --> 1:38:24.380
 to organize your behavior.

1:38:24.380 --> 1:38:26.460
 That doesn't mean that rationality

1:38:26.460 --> 1:38:28.420
 is the absence of emotion,

1:38:28.420 --> 1:38:33.180
 because sometimes emotion or any feelings in general,

1:38:33.180 --> 1:38:37.300
 not the same thing as emotion, that's another topic,

1:38:37.300 --> 1:38:41.540
 but are a source of information

1:38:41.540 --> 1:38:42.820
 and their wisdom and helpful.

1:38:42.820 --> 1:38:44.380
 So I'm not saying that,

1:38:44.380 --> 1:38:45.380
 but what I am saying is that

1:38:45.380 --> 1:38:46.820
 if you have a deeply held belief

1:38:46.820 --> 1:38:50.340
 and the evidence shows that you're wrong, then you're wrong.

1:38:50.340 --> 1:38:52.780
 It doesn't really matter how confident you feel.

1:38:53.660 --> 1:38:56.160
 That confidence could be also explained by science, right?

1:38:56.160 --> 1:38:59.640
 So it would be the same thing as if I,

1:38:59.640 --> 1:39:02.340
 regardless of whether someone is like Charlie Baker,

1:39:02.340 --> 1:39:04.380
 regardless of whether somebody is a Republican

1:39:04.380 --> 1:39:05.220
 or a Democrat,

1:39:05.220 --> 1:39:09.300
 if that person has a record that you can see

1:39:09.300 --> 1:39:11.900
 is consistent with what you believe,

1:39:11.900 --> 1:39:14.720
 then that is information that you can act on.

1:39:15.700 --> 1:39:17.980
 Yeah, and then try to,

1:39:17.980 --> 1:39:21.100
 I mean, this is kind of what empathy is in open mindedness,

1:39:21.100 --> 1:39:25.280
 is try to consider that the set of concepts

1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:27.420
 that your brain has constructed

1:39:27.420 --> 1:39:30.220
 through which you are now perceiving the world

1:39:30.220 --> 1:39:32.240
 is not painting the full picture.

1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:35.140
 I mean, this is now true for basically every,

1:39:35.140 --> 1:39:36.500
 it doesn't have to be men and women,

1:39:36.500 --> 1:39:39.580
 it could be basically the prism through which we perceive

1:39:39.580 --> 1:39:41.660
 actually the political discourse, right?

1:39:41.660 --> 1:39:44.460
 Absolutely, so here's what I would say.

1:39:49.040 --> 1:39:52.180
 There are people who, scientists who will talk to you

1:39:52.180 --> 1:39:54.740
 about cognitive empathy and emotional empathy

1:39:54.740 --> 1:39:59.540
 and I prefer to think of it,

1:39:59.540 --> 1:40:01.980
 I think the evidence is more consistent

1:40:01.980 --> 1:40:03.160
 with what I'm about to say,

1:40:03.160 --> 1:40:08.160
 which is that your brain is always making predictions

1:40:08.180 --> 1:40:11.420
 using your own past experience and what you've learned

1:40:11.420 --> 1:40:14.900
 from books and movies and other people telling you

1:40:14.900 --> 1:40:16.580
 about their experiences and so on.

1:40:17.700 --> 1:40:22.700
 And if your brain cannot make a concept

1:40:22.700 --> 1:40:25.840
 to make sense of those, anticipate what those sense data are

1:40:25.840 --> 1:40:29.880
 and make sense of them, you will be experientially blind.

1:40:31.080 --> 1:40:34.160
 So, when I'm giving lectures to people,

1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:37.920
 I'll show them like a blobby black and white image

1:40:37.920 --> 1:40:42.240
 and they're experientially blind to the image,

1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:44.200
 they can't see anything in it.

1:40:44.200 --> 1:40:45.860
 And then I show them a photograph

1:40:45.860 --> 1:40:48.700
 and then I show them the image again, the blobby image

1:40:48.700 --> 1:40:51.040
 and then they see actually an object in it.

1:40:51.040 --> 1:40:53.840
 But the image is the same.

1:40:53.840 --> 1:40:55.720
 It's they're actually adding,

1:40:55.720 --> 1:40:57.760
 their predictions now are adding, right?

1:40:57.760 --> 1:41:02.500
 Or anybody who's learned a language,

1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:07.400
 a second language after their first language

1:41:07.400 --> 1:41:10.800
 also has this experience of things

1:41:10.800 --> 1:41:12.320
 that initially sound like sounds

1:41:12.320 --> 1:41:14.100
 that they can't quite make sense of,

1:41:14.100 --> 1:41:18.160
 eventually come to make sense of them.

1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:20.600
 And in fact, there are really cool examples

1:41:20.600 --> 1:41:23.280
 of people who were like born blind

1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:28.200
 because they have cataracts or they have corneal damage

1:41:28.200 --> 1:41:33.200
 so that no light is reaching the brain.

1:41:33.800 --> 1:41:35.960
 And then they have an operation

1:41:35.960 --> 1:41:39.580
 and then light reaches the brain and they can't see.

1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:45.120
 For days and weeks and sometimes years,

1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:47.600
 they are experientially blind to certain things.

1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:51.040
 So what happens with empathy, right?

1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:54.820
 Is that your brain is making a prediction.

1:41:54.820 --> 1:41:59.820
 And if it doesn't have the capacity to make,

1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:06.620
 if you don't share, if you're not similar,

1:42:06.620 --> 1:42:10.520
 remember categories are instances

1:42:10.520 --> 1:42:12.020
 which are similar in some way.

1:42:12.020 --> 1:42:16.040
 If you are not similar enough to that person,

1:42:16.040 --> 1:42:17.800
 you will have a hard time making a prediction

1:42:17.800 --> 1:42:19.440
 about what they feel.

1:42:19.440 --> 1:42:22.600
 You will be experientially blind to what they feel.

1:42:24.920 --> 1:42:29.420
 In the United States, children of color

1:42:29.420 --> 1:42:33.620
 are under prescribed medicine by their physicians.

1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:37.520
 This is been documented.

1:42:38.760 --> 1:42:43.760
 It's not that the physicians are racist necessarily

1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:48.020
 but they might be experientially blind.

1:42:52.140 --> 1:42:54.500
 The same thing is true of male physicians

1:42:54.500 --> 1:42:56.780
 with female patients.

1:42:56.780 --> 1:43:00.220
 I could tell you some hair raising stories really

1:43:00.220 --> 1:43:03.020
 that where people die as a consequence

1:43:03.020 --> 1:43:07.100
 of a physician making the wrong inference,

1:43:07.100 --> 1:43:11.120
 the wrong prediction because of being experientially blind.

1:43:11.120 --> 1:43:16.120
 So we are, empathy is not, it's not magic.

1:43:21.220 --> 1:43:23.620
 We make inferences about each other,

1:43:23.620 --> 1:43:26.180
 about what each other's feeling and thinking.

1:43:26.180 --> 1:43:28.260
 In this culture more than,

1:43:28.260 --> 1:43:30.620
 there are some cultures where people

1:43:31.740 --> 1:43:33.500
 have what's called opacity of mind

1:43:33.500 --> 1:43:34.820
 where they will make a prediction

1:43:34.820 --> 1:43:35.860
 about someone else's actions

1:43:35.860 --> 1:43:37.140
 but they're not inferring anything

1:43:37.140 --> 1:43:39.940
 about the internal state of that person.

1:43:39.940 --> 1:43:43.460
 But in our culture, we're constantly making inferences.

1:43:43.460 --> 1:43:44.980
 What is this person thinking?

1:43:44.980 --> 1:43:47.300
 And we're not doing it necessarily consciously

1:43:47.300 --> 1:43:48.780
 but we're just doing it really automatically

1:43:48.780 --> 1:43:51.660
 using our predictions, what we know.

1:43:51.660 --> 1:43:56.660
 And if you expose yourself to information

1:43:57.620 --> 1:43:59.980
 which is very different from somebody else,

1:43:59.980 --> 1:44:03.740
 I mean, really what we have is we have different cultures

1:44:03.740 --> 1:44:07.140
 in this country right now that are,

1:44:07.140 --> 1:44:08.920
 there are a number of reasons for this.

1:44:08.920 --> 1:44:10.620
 I mean, part of it is, I don't know if you saw

1:44:10.620 --> 1:44:13.580
 the Social Dilemma, the Netflix.

1:44:14.740 --> 1:44:15.580
 Heard about it.

1:44:15.580 --> 1:44:20.580
 Yeah, it's a great, it's really great documentary and...

1:44:20.900 --> 1:44:23.260
 About what social networks are doing to our society?

1:44:23.260 --> 1:44:24.740
 Yeah, yeah.

1:44:24.740 --> 1:44:29.740
 But nothing, no phenomenon has a simple single cause.

1:44:31.700 --> 1:44:35.020
 There are multiple small causes

1:44:35.020 --> 1:44:37.100
 which all add up to a perfect storm.

1:44:37.100 --> 1:44:41.900
 That's just how most things work.

1:44:41.900 --> 1:44:45.140
 And so the fact that machine learning algorithms

1:44:45.140 --> 1:44:48.860
 are serving people up information on social media

1:44:48.860 --> 1:44:51.380
 that is consistent with what they've already viewed

1:44:51.380 --> 1:44:56.380
 and making, is part of the reason that you have these silos

1:44:57.600 --> 1:45:00.860
 but it's not the only reason why you have these silos.

1:45:00.860 --> 1:45:04.540
 I think there are other things afoot

1:45:04.540 --> 1:45:09.500
 that enhance people's inability

1:45:09.500 --> 1:45:13.340
 to even have a decent conversation.

1:45:13.340 --> 1:45:15.700
 Yeah, I mean, okay, so many things you said

1:45:15.700 --> 1:45:20.000
 are just brilliant, so the experiential blindness

1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:24.140
 but also from my perspective, like I preach

1:45:24.140 --> 1:45:27.180
 and I try to practice empathy a lot

1:45:27.180 --> 1:45:30.780
 and something about the way you've explained it

1:45:30.780 --> 1:45:33.620
 makes me almost see it as a kind of exercise

1:45:33.620 --> 1:45:35.820
 that we should all do, like to train,

1:45:35.820 --> 1:45:38.740
 like to add experiences to the brain

1:45:38.740 --> 1:45:42.660
 to expand this capacity to predict more effectively.

1:45:42.660 --> 1:45:43.620
 Absolutely.

1:45:43.620 --> 1:45:47.660
 So like what I do is kind of like a method acting thing

1:45:47.660 --> 1:45:51.260
 which is I imagine what the life of a person is like.

1:45:52.900 --> 1:45:54.900
 Just think, I mean, this is something you see

1:45:54.900 --> 1:45:58.220
 with Black Lives Matter and police officers.

1:45:58.220 --> 1:46:01.900
 It feels like they're both, not both,

1:46:01.900 --> 1:46:03.940
 but I have, because martial arts and so on,

1:46:03.940 --> 1:46:06.580
 I have a lot of friends who are cops.

1:46:06.580 --> 1:46:09.220
 They don't necessarily

1:46:11.780 --> 1:46:14.940
 have empathy or visualize the experience of the other.

1:46:14.940 --> 1:46:17.000
 Certainly, currently, unfortunately,

1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:19.380
 people aren't doing that with police officers.

1:46:19.380 --> 1:46:22.980
 They're not imagining, they're not empathizing

1:46:22.980 --> 1:46:26.300
 or putting themselves in the shoes of a police officer

1:46:26.300 --> 1:46:28.620
 to realize how difficult that job is,

1:46:28.620 --> 1:46:32.340
 how dangerous it is, how difficult it is to maintain calm

1:46:32.340 --> 1:46:35.140
 and under so much uncertainty, all those kinds of things.

1:46:35.140 --> 1:46:37.720
 But there's more, there's even, that's all that's true,

1:46:37.720 --> 1:46:39.500
 but I think that there's even more,

1:46:39.500 --> 1:46:41.300
 there's even more to be said there.

1:46:41.300 --> 1:46:44.400
 I mean, like from a predicting brain standpoint,

1:46:44.400 --> 1:46:47.100
 there's even more that can be said there.

1:46:47.100 --> 1:46:48.680
 So I don't know if you wanna go down that path

1:46:48.680 --> 1:46:49.920
 or you wanna stick on empathy,

1:46:49.920 --> 1:46:52.980
 but I will also say that one of the things

1:46:52.980 --> 1:46:57.020
 that I was most gratified by, I still am receiving,

1:46:57.020 --> 1:46:59.660
 it's been more than three and a half years

1:46:59.660 --> 1:47:00.940
 since How Motions Are Made came out

1:47:00.940 --> 1:47:04.380
 and I'm still receiving daily emails from people, right?

1:47:04.380 --> 1:47:05.780
 So that's gratifying.

1:47:05.780 --> 1:47:09.700
 But one of the most gratifying emails I received

1:47:09.700 --> 1:47:12.780
 was from a police officer in Texas

1:47:12.780 --> 1:47:17.060
 who told me that he thought that How Motions Are Made

1:47:19.180 --> 1:47:24.180
 contained information that would be really helpful

1:47:24.180 --> 1:47:28.820
 to resolving some of these difficulties.

1:47:28.820 --> 1:47:33.100
 And he hadn't even read my op ed piece

1:47:33.100 --> 1:47:35.060
 about when is a gun not a gun?

1:47:35.060 --> 1:47:39.260
 And like using what we know about the science of perception

1:47:39.260 --> 1:47:41.740
 from a prediction standpoint,

1:47:41.740 --> 1:47:43.660
 like the brain is a predictor,

1:47:43.660 --> 1:47:45.820
 to understand a little differently

1:47:45.820 --> 1:47:49.180
 what might be happening in these circumstances.

1:47:49.180 --> 1:47:52.340
 So there's a real, what's hard about,

1:47:52.340 --> 1:47:57.340
 it's hard to talk about because everyone gets mad at you

1:47:57.580 --> 1:47:59.460
 when you talk about this, like, you know.

1:47:59.460 --> 1:48:02.620
 And there is a way to understand this

1:48:02.620 --> 1:48:05.020
 which has profound empathy

1:48:05.020 --> 1:48:10.020
 for the suffering of people of color

1:48:10.020 --> 1:48:15.020
 and that definitely is in line with Black Lives Matter

1:48:15.780 --> 1:48:18.100
 at the same time as understanding

1:48:18.100 --> 1:48:21.060
 the really difficult situation

1:48:21.060 --> 1:48:23.460
 that police officers find themselves in.

1:48:23.460 --> 1:48:26.500
 And I'm not talking about this bad apple or that bad apple.

1:48:26.500 --> 1:48:28.020
 I'm not talking about police officers

1:48:28.020 --> 1:48:30.220
 who are necessarily shooting people in the back

1:48:30.220 --> 1:48:31.260
 as they run away.

1:48:31.260 --> 1:48:34.420
 I'm talking about the cases of really good,

1:48:34.420 --> 1:48:39.420
 well meaning cops who have the kind of predicting brain

1:48:39.460 --> 1:48:41.340
 that everybody else has.

1:48:42.540 --> 1:48:45.980
 They're in a really difficult situation

1:48:45.980 --> 1:48:50.420
 that I think both they and the people

1:48:50.420 --> 1:48:55.260
 who are harmed don't realize,

1:48:55.260 --> 1:48:58.300
 like the way that these situations are constructed,

1:48:58.300 --> 1:49:01.420
 I think it's just, there's a lot to be said there I guess

1:49:01.420 --> 1:49:02.260
 is what I want to say.

1:49:02.260 --> 1:49:06.060
 Yeah, is there something we can try to say in a sense,

1:49:06.060 --> 1:49:09.660
 like what I'm, from the perspective of the predictive brain

1:49:09.660 --> 1:49:14.660
 which is a fascinating perspective to take on this,

1:49:15.100 --> 1:49:18.100
 you know, all the protests that are going on,

1:49:18.100 --> 1:49:22.540
 there seems to be a concept of a police officer being built.

1:49:22.540 --> 1:49:25.620
 No, I think that concept is there.

1:49:25.620 --> 1:49:30.620
 But it's gaining strength, so it's being re, I mean.

1:49:30.940 --> 1:49:31.780
 Yeah, it is.

1:49:31.780 --> 1:49:32.940
 Sure, it is there.

1:49:32.940 --> 1:49:35.380
 But I think, yeah, for sure, I think that that's right.

1:49:35.380 --> 1:49:40.380
 I think that there's a shift in the stereotype

1:49:42.580 --> 1:49:44.380
 of what I would say is a stereotype.

1:49:44.380 --> 1:49:48.260
 There's a stereotype of a black man in this country

1:49:48.260 --> 1:49:50.740
 that's always in movies and television,

1:49:50.740 --> 1:49:55.740
 not always, but like largely, that many people watch.

1:49:56.660 --> 1:50:00.220
 I mean, you think you're watching a 10 o clock drama

1:50:00.220 --> 1:50:02.660
 and all you're doing is like kicking back and relaxing,

1:50:02.660 --> 1:50:07.020
 but actually you're having certain predictions reinforced

1:50:07.020 --> 1:50:07.940
 and others not.

1:50:07.940 --> 1:50:12.740
 And what's happening now with police is the same thing,

1:50:12.740 --> 1:50:16.860
 that there are certain stereotypes of a police officer

1:50:16.860 --> 1:50:19.540
 that are being abandoned and other stereotypes

1:50:19.540 --> 1:50:23.900
 that are being reinforced by what you see happening.

1:50:23.900 --> 1:50:26.420
 All I'll say is that if you remember,

1:50:26.420 --> 1:50:28.500
 I mean, there's a lot to say about this, really,

1:50:28.500 --> 1:50:33.180
 that regardless of whether it makes people mad or not,

1:50:33.180 --> 1:50:35.940
 I mean, I just, the science is what it is.

1:50:37.700 --> 1:50:39.140
 Just remember what I said.

1:50:39.140 --> 1:50:44.140
 The brain makes predictions about internal changes

1:50:45.500 --> 1:50:49.140
 in the body first and then it starts to prepare motor action

1:50:49.140 --> 1:50:52.980
 and then it makes a prediction about what you will see

1:50:52.980 --> 1:50:57.220
 and hear and feel based on those actions, okay?

1:50:57.220 --> 1:51:01.740
 So it's also the case that we didn't talk about

1:51:01.740 --> 1:51:04.260
 is that sensory sampling,

1:51:04.260 --> 1:51:07.100
 like your brain's ability to sample what's out there

1:51:07.100 --> 1:51:12.100
 is yoked to your heart rate, it's yoked to your heartbeats.

1:51:12.900 --> 1:51:15.260
 There are certain phases of the heartbeat

1:51:15.260 --> 1:51:17.620
 where it's easier for you to see what's happening

1:51:17.620 --> 1:51:20.140
 in the world than in others.

1:51:20.140 --> 1:51:23.420
 And so if your heart rate goes through the roof,

1:51:26.260 --> 1:51:28.540
 you will be less likely, you will be more likely

1:51:28.540 --> 1:51:32.180
 to just go with your prediction and not correct

1:51:32.180 --> 1:51:34.740
 based on what's out there

1:51:34.740 --> 1:51:37.860
 because you're actually literally not seeing as well.

1:51:39.180 --> 1:51:41.980
 Or you will see things that aren't there, basically.

1:51:43.700 --> 1:51:48.380
 Is there something that we could say by way of advice

1:51:48.380 --> 1:51:52.500
 for when this episode is released

1:51:52.500 --> 1:51:57.100
 in the chaos of emotion?

1:51:57.100 --> 1:51:58.900
 Sorry, I don't know about a term

1:51:58.900 --> 1:52:01.340
 that's just flying around on social media.

1:52:01.340 --> 1:52:02.780
 What's?

1:52:02.780 --> 1:52:06.300
 Well, I actually think it is emotion in the following sense.

1:52:07.460 --> 1:52:10.260
 And it sounds a little bit like,

1:52:10.260 --> 1:52:14.420
 it sounds a little bit like artificial

1:52:14.420 --> 1:52:16.060
 in the way that I'm about to say it,

1:52:16.060 --> 1:52:18.940
 but I really think that this is what's happening.

1:52:18.940 --> 1:52:23.940
 One thing we haven't talked about is brains evolved,

1:52:24.020 --> 1:52:25.300
 didn't evolve for you to see,

1:52:25.300 --> 1:52:26.980
 they didn't evolve for you to hear,

1:52:26.980 --> 1:52:28.180
 they didn't evolve for you to feel,

1:52:28.180 --> 1:52:30.020
 they evolved to control your body.

1:52:30.020 --> 1:52:31.700
 That's why you have a brain.

1:52:31.700 --> 1:52:34.260
 You have a brain so that it can control your body.

1:52:34.260 --> 1:52:36.340
 And the metaphor,

1:52:36.340 --> 1:52:39.220
 the scientific term for predictively controlling your body

1:52:39.220 --> 1:52:40.540
 is allostasis.

1:52:40.540 --> 1:52:45.540
 Your brain is attempting to anticipate the needs

1:52:45.620 --> 1:52:48.180
 of your body and meet those needs before they arise

1:52:48.180 --> 1:52:51.340
 so that you can act as you need to act.

1:52:51.340 --> 1:52:55.060
 And the metaphor that I use is a body budget.

1:52:55.060 --> 1:52:57.420
 You know, your brain is running a budget for your body.

1:52:57.420 --> 1:52:58.540
 It's not budgeting money,

1:52:58.540 --> 1:53:01.860
 it's budgeting glucose and salt and water.

1:53:01.860 --> 1:53:04.180
 And instead of having, you know,

1:53:04.180 --> 1:53:06.940
 one or two bank accounts, it has gazillions.

1:53:06.940 --> 1:53:08.380
 There are all these systems in your body

1:53:08.380 --> 1:53:10.820
 that have to be kept in balance.

1:53:10.820 --> 1:53:14.460
 And it's monitoring very closely,

1:53:14.460 --> 1:53:16.820
 it's making predictions about like,

1:53:16.820 --> 1:53:19.620
 when is it good to spend and when is it good to save

1:53:19.620 --> 1:53:21.140
 and what would be a good investment

1:53:21.140 --> 1:53:23.860
 and am I gonna get a return on my investment?

1:53:23.860 --> 1:53:27.060
 Whenever people talk about reward or reward prediction error

1:53:27.060 --> 1:53:29.820
 or anything to do with reward or punishment,

1:53:29.820 --> 1:53:32.900
 they're talking about the body budget.

1:53:32.900 --> 1:53:34.540
 They're talking about your brain's predictions

1:53:34.540 --> 1:53:37.780
 about whether or not there will be a deposit or withdrawal.

1:53:39.440 --> 1:53:44.440
 So when your brain is running a deficit

1:53:47.720 --> 1:53:48.640
 in your body budgets,

1:53:48.640 --> 1:53:50.780
 you have some kind of metabolic imbalance,

1:53:51.660 --> 1:53:55.080
 you experience that as discomfort.

1:53:55.080 --> 1:53:57.140
 You experience that as distress.

1:53:58.040 --> 1:54:00.980
 When your brain, when things are chaotic,

1:54:00.980 --> 1:54:05.500
 you can't predict what's going to happen next.

1:54:05.500 --> 1:54:08.840
 So I have this absolutely brilliant scientist

1:54:08.840 --> 1:54:13.560
 working in my lab, his name is Jordan Theriot

1:54:13.560 --> 1:54:17.040
 and he's published this really terrific paper

1:54:17.040 --> 1:54:22.040
 on a sense of should, like why do we have social rules?

1:54:22.040 --> 1:54:27.040
 Why do we adhere to social norms?

1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:31.320
 It's because if I make myself predictable to you,

1:54:31.320 --> 1:54:33.680
 then you are predictable to me.

1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:36.760
 And if you're predictable to me, that's good

1:54:36.760 --> 1:54:39.760
 because that is less metabolically expensive for me.

1:54:41.520 --> 1:54:46.520
 Novelty or unpredictability at the extreme is expensive.

1:54:46.520 --> 1:54:48.520
 And if it goes on for long enough,

1:54:48.520 --> 1:54:50.760
 what happens is first of all,

1:54:50.760 --> 1:54:53.760
 you will feel really jittery and antsy,

1:54:53.760 --> 1:54:56.880
 which we describe as anxiety.

1:54:56.880 --> 1:54:58.560
 It isn't necessarily anxiety.

1:54:58.560 --> 1:55:03.560
 It could be just something is not predictable

1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:06.400
 and you are experiencing arousal

1:55:06.400 --> 1:55:09.920
 because the chemicals that help you learn

1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:13.400
 increase your feeling of arousal basically.

1:55:13.400 --> 1:55:15.160
 But if it goes on for long enough,

1:55:15.160 --> 1:55:16.440
 you will become depleted

1:55:17.900 --> 1:55:20.120
 and you will start to feel really, really,

1:55:20.120 --> 1:55:22.080
 really distressed.

1:55:22.080 --> 1:55:27.000
 So what we have is a culture full of people right now

1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:30.800
 who their body budgets are just decimated

1:55:32.120 --> 1:55:34.680
 and there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty.

1:55:36.720 --> 1:55:39.720
 When you talk about it as depression and anxiety,

1:55:39.720 --> 1:55:43.860
 it makes you think that it's not about your metabolism,

1:55:43.860 --> 1:55:46.000
 that it's not about your body budgeting,

1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:48.360
 that it's not about getting enough sleep

1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:51.480
 or about eating well or about making sure

1:55:51.480 --> 1:55:53.180
 that you have social connections.

1:55:55.120 --> 1:55:57.000
 You think that it's something separate from that.

1:55:57.000 --> 1:55:58.840
 But depression and anxiety are just a way

1:55:58.840 --> 1:56:00.420
 of being in the world.

1:56:01.640 --> 1:56:04.040
 They're a way of being in the world

1:56:04.040 --> 1:56:06.860
 when things aren't quite right with your predictions.

1:56:08.720 --> 1:56:10.600
 That's such a deep way of thinking.

1:56:10.600 --> 1:56:15.600
 Like the brain is maintaining homeostasis.

1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:17.880
 It's actually allostasis.

1:56:17.880 --> 1:56:19.800
 I'm sorry.

1:56:19.800 --> 1:56:22.840
 And it's constantly making predictions

1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:24.420
 and metabolically speaking,

1:56:24.420 --> 1:56:26.640
 it's very costly to make novel,

1:56:26.640 --> 1:56:29.920
 like constantly be learning to making adjustments.

1:56:29.920 --> 1:56:34.920
 And then over time, there's a cost to be paid

1:56:35.240 --> 1:56:39.200
 if you're just in a place of chaos

1:56:39.200 --> 1:56:42.760
 where there's constant need for adjusting

1:56:42.760 --> 1:56:46.880
 and learning and experience novel things.

1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:49.520
 And so part of the problem here,

1:56:49.520 --> 1:56:50.480
 there are a couple of things.

1:56:50.480 --> 1:56:52.400
 Like I said, it's a perfect storm.

1:56:52.400 --> 1:56:54.760
 There isn't a single cause.

1:56:54.760 --> 1:56:55.800
 There are multiple cause,

1:56:55.800 --> 1:56:57.440
 multiple things that combine together.

1:56:57.440 --> 1:57:00.540
 It's a complex system, multiple things.

1:57:01.520 --> 1:57:06.520
 Part of it is that they're metabolically encumbered

1:57:08.040 --> 1:57:09.240
 and they're distressed.

1:57:10.120 --> 1:57:12.760
 And in order to try to have empathy

1:57:12.760 --> 1:57:16.120
 for someone who is very much unlike you,

1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:19.040
 you have to forage for information.

1:57:19.040 --> 1:57:22.480
 You have to explore information

1:57:22.480 --> 1:57:25.960
 that is novel to you and unexpected.

1:57:25.960 --> 1:57:27.960
 And that's expensive.

1:57:27.960 --> 1:57:31.040
 And at a time when people feel,

1:57:31.040 --> 1:57:33.720
 what do you do when you are running a deficit

1:57:33.720 --> 1:57:34.880
 in your bank account?

1:57:34.880 --> 1:57:37.000
 You stop spending.

1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:40.400
 What does it mean for a brain to stop spending?

1:57:40.400 --> 1:57:43.160
 A brain stops moving very much,

1:57:43.160 --> 1:57:46.920
 stops moving the body and it stops learning.

1:57:46.920 --> 1:57:48.720
 It just goes with its internal model.

1:57:48.720 --> 1:57:50.720
 Brilliantly put, yeah.

1:57:50.720 --> 1:57:54.000
 So empathy requires,

1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:56.640
 to have empathy for someone who is unlike you

1:57:57.920 --> 1:58:02.920
 requires learning and practice, foraging for information.

1:58:04.280 --> 1:58:07.200
 I mean, it is something I talk about in the book

1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:08.800
 in seven and a half lessons about the brain.

1:58:08.800 --> 1:58:10.440
 I think it's really important.

1:58:10.440 --> 1:58:13.160
 It's hard, but it's hard.

1:58:13.160 --> 1:58:16.520
 I think it's hard for people to have,

1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:20.800
 to be curious about views that are unlike their own

1:58:22.640 --> 1:58:26.360
 when they feel so encumbered.

1:58:26.360 --> 1:58:29.200
 And I'll just tell you, I had this epiphany really.

1:58:30.160 --> 1:58:34.640
 I was listening to Robert Reich's The System.

1:58:34.640 --> 1:58:39.000
 He was talking about oligarchy versus democracy.

1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:41.800
 And so oligarchy is where very wealthy people,

1:58:41.800 --> 1:58:43.680
 like extremely wealthy people,

1:58:46.480 --> 1:58:51.000
 shift power so that they become even more wealthy

1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:52.400
 and even more insulated

1:58:52.400 --> 1:58:56.480
 and from the pressures of the common person.

1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:00.800
 It's actually the kind of system

1:59:00.800 --> 1:59:04.120
 that leads to the collapse of civilizations

1:59:04.120 --> 1:59:05.920
 if you believe Jared Diamond.

1:59:05.920 --> 1:59:06.760
 Just say that.

1:59:06.760 --> 1:59:08.640
 But anyways, I'm listening to this

1:59:08.640 --> 1:59:13.640
 and I'm listening to him describe in fairly decent detail

1:59:13.960 --> 1:59:18.560
 how the CEOs of these companies,

1:59:18.560 --> 1:59:21.080
 there's been a shift in what it means to be a CEO

1:59:21.080 --> 1:59:25.280
 and no longer being a steward of the community and so on,

1:59:25.280 --> 1:59:27.440
 but like in the 1980s, it sort of shifted

1:59:27.440 --> 1:59:30.680
 to this other model of being like an oligarch.

1:59:30.680 --> 1:59:35.120
 And he's talking about how it used to be the case

1:59:35.120 --> 1:59:40.120
 that CEOs made like 20 times what their employees made

1:59:45.240 --> 1:59:48.000
 and now they make about 300 times on average

1:59:48.000 --> 1:59:49.080
 what their employees made.

1:59:49.080 --> 1:59:50.760
 So where did that money come from?

1:59:51.640 --> 1:59:53.960
 It came from the pockets of the employees.

1:59:55.040 --> 1:59:57.360
 And they don't know about it, right?

1:59:57.360 --> 1:59:58.360
 No one knows about it.

1:59:58.360 --> 2:00:00.960
 They just know they can't feed their children,

2:00:00.960 --> 2:00:03.400
 they can't pay for healthcare,

2:00:03.400 --> 2:00:05.240
 they can't take care of their family

2:00:05.240 --> 2:00:08.280
 and they worry about what's gonna happen to their,

2:00:08.280 --> 2:00:11.280
 they're living like months a month basically.

2:00:11.280 --> 2:00:13.960
 Any one big bill could completely

2:00:13.960 --> 2:00:15.240
 put them out on the street.

2:00:15.240 --> 2:00:17.880
 So there are a huge number of people living like this.

2:00:17.880 --> 2:00:19.880
 So all they, what they're experiencing,

2:00:19.880 --> 2:00:22.280
 they don't know why they're experiencing it.

2:00:22.280 --> 2:00:26.720
 And then someone comes along and gives them a narrative.

2:00:26.720 --> 2:00:29.880
 Well, somebody else butted in line in front of you

2:00:29.880 --> 2:00:32.960
 and that's why you're this way.

2:00:32.960 --> 2:00:35.120
 That's why you experience what you're experiencing.

2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:39.280
 And just for a minute, I was thinking,

2:00:39.280 --> 2:00:44.280
 I had deep empathy for people who have beliefs

2:00:44.640 --> 2:00:49.320
 that are really, really, really different from mine.

2:00:50.360 --> 2:00:55.360
 But I was trying really hard to see it through their eyes.

2:00:55.440 --> 2:00:59.320
 And did it cost me something metabolically?

2:00:59.320 --> 2:01:02.080
 I'm sure, I'm sure.

2:01:02.080 --> 2:01:04.640
 But you had something in the gas tank.

2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:07.120
 Well, I. In order to allocate that.

2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:08.600
 I mean, that's the question is like,

2:01:08.600 --> 2:01:13.080
 where did you, what resources did your brain draw on

2:01:13.080 --> 2:01:14.680
 in order to actually make that effort?

2:01:14.680 --> 2:01:17.520
 Well, I'll tell you something, honestly, Lex.

2:01:17.520 --> 2:01:19.920
 I don't have that much in the gas tank right now.

2:01:19.920 --> 2:01:24.920
 Right, so I am surfing the stress that,

2:01:26.920 --> 2:01:28.560
 stress is just, what is stress?

2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:31.680
 Stress is your brain is preparing for a big metabolic outlay

2:01:31.680 --> 2:01:33.560
 and it just keeps preparing and preparing

2:01:33.560 --> 2:01:35.240
 and preparing and preparing.

2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:37.480
 You as a professor, you as a human.

2:01:37.480 --> 2:01:39.040
 Both, right?

2:01:39.040 --> 2:01:42.680
 For me, this is a moment of existential crisis

2:01:42.680 --> 2:01:45.480
 as much as anybody else, democracy, all of these things.

2:01:45.480 --> 2:01:50.360
 So in many of my roles, so I guess what I'm trying to say

2:01:50.360 --> 2:01:55.360
 is that I get up every morning and I exercise.

2:01:55.360 --> 2:01:58.880
 I run, I row, I lift weights, right?

2:01:58.880 --> 2:02:00.360
 You exercise in the middle of the day.

2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:03.160
 I saw your like, you know, daily thing.

2:02:03.160 --> 2:02:06.000
 Yeah, I hate it actually.

2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:07.040
 You love it, right?

2:02:07.040 --> 2:02:07.880
 You get a...

2:02:07.880 --> 2:02:08.700
 No, I hate it.

2:02:08.700 --> 2:02:13.400
 I hate it, but I do it religiously.

2:02:13.400 --> 2:02:14.520
 Why?

2:02:14.520 --> 2:02:16.560
 Because it's a really good investment.

2:02:16.560 --> 2:02:20.320
 It's an expenditure that is a really good investment.

2:02:20.320 --> 2:02:25.320
 And so when I was exercising, I was listening to the book

2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:28.320
 and when I realized the insights that I was sort of like

2:02:28.320 --> 2:02:31.200
 playing around with, like, is this, does this make sense?

2:02:31.200 --> 2:02:32.040
 Does this make sense?

2:02:32.040 --> 2:02:34.320
 I didn't immediately plunge into it.

2:02:34.320 --> 2:02:38.080
 I basically wrote some stuff down, I set it aside

2:02:38.080 --> 2:02:42.320
 and then I did what I prepared myself to make an expenditure.

2:02:42.320 --> 2:02:44.720
 I don't know what you do before you exercise.

2:02:44.720 --> 2:02:48.200
 I always have a protein shake, always have a protein shake

2:02:48.200 --> 2:02:50.120
 because I need to fuel up

2:02:50.120 --> 2:02:52.280
 before I make this really big expenditure.

2:02:52.280 --> 2:02:55.640
 And so I did the same thing.

2:02:55.640 --> 2:02:58.920
 I didn't have a protein drink, but I did the same thing.

2:02:58.920 --> 2:03:01.640
 And fueling up can mean lots of different things.

2:03:01.640 --> 2:03:03.520
 It can mean talking to a friend about it.

2:03:03.520 --> 2:03:07.160
 It can mean, you know, it can mean making sure

2:03:07.160 --> 2:03:08.800
 you get a good night's sleep before you do it.

2:03:08.800 --> 2:03:10.320
 It can mean lots of different things,

2:03:10.320 --> 2:03:15.320
 but I guess I think we have to do these things.

2:03:17.840 --> 2:03:20.640
 Yeah, that's a good question.

2:03:20.640 --> 2:03:24.320
 Yeah, I'm gonna re listen to this conversation

2:03:24.320 --> 2:03:26.320
 several times, this is brilliant.

2:03:26.320 --> 2:03:31.320
 But I do think about, you know, I've encountered

2:03:31.880 --> 2:03:35.560
 so many people that can't possibly imagine

2:03:35.560 --> 2:03:38.560
 that a good human being can vote for Donald Trump.

2:03:38.560 --> 2:03:43.560
 And I've also encountered people that can't imagine

2:03:43.880 --> 2:03:47.880
 that an intelligent person can possibly vote for Democrat.

2:03:47.880 --> 2:03:52.040
 And I look at both these people,

2:03:52.040 --> 2:03:57.040
 many of whom are friends, and let's just say,

2:03:57.360 --> 2:04:00.280
 after this conversation, I can see as they're predicting

2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:04.360
 brains not willing to invest the resources

2:04:04.360 --> 2:04:06.160
 to empathize with the other side.

2:04:06.160 --> 2:04:10.000
 And I think you have to in order to be able to,

2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:14.520
 like, to see the obvious common humanity in us.

2:04:14.520 --> 2:04:16.100
 I don't know what the system is

2:04:16.100 --> 2:04:17.840
 that's creating this division.

2:04:17.840 --> 2:04:20.240
 We can put it, like you said, it's a perfect storm.

2:04:20.240 --> 2:04:22.200
 It might be the social media,

2:04:22.200 --> 2:04:23.040
 I don't know what the hell it is.

2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:24.540
 I think it's a bunch of things.

2:04:24.540 --> 2:04:27.560
 I think it's, there's an economic system,

2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:30.960
 which is disadvantaging large numbers of people.

2:04:30.960 --> 2:04:34.420
 There's a use of social media.

2:04:34.420 --> 2:04:37.360
 Like if you, you know, if I had to orchestrate

2:04:37.360 --> 2:04:40.960
 or architect a system that would screw up

2:04:40.960 --> 2:04:44.360
 a human body budget, it would be the one that we live in.

2:04:44.360 --> 2:04:45.600
 You know, we don't sleep enough.

2:04:45.600 --> 2:04:48.960
 We eat pseudo food, basically.

2:04:48.960 --> 2:04:51.600
 We are on social media too much,

2:04:51.600 --> 2:04:52.920
 which is full of ambiguity,

2:04:52.920 --> 2:04:55.980
 which is really hard for a human nervous system, right?

2:04:55.980 --> 2:04:57.060
 Really, really hard.

2:04:57.060 --> 2:04:59.700
 Like ambiguity with no context to predict in.

2:04:59.700 --> 2:05:01.160
 I mean, it's like, really?

2:05:01.160 --> 2:05:03.800
 And then, you know, there are the economic concerns

2:05:03.800 --> 2:05:06.280
 that affect large swaths of people in this country.

2:05:06.280 --> 2:05:09.300
 I mean, it's really, I'm not saying everything

2:05:09.300 --> 2:05:11.780
 is reducible to metabolism.

2:05:11.780 --> 2:05:13.600
 Not everything is reducible to metabolism,

2:05:13.600 --> 2:05:18.500
 but there, if you combine all these things together.

2:05:18.500 --> 2:05:20.080
 It's helpful to think of it that way.

2:05:20.080 --> 2:05:22.180
 Then somehow it's also,

2:05:24.040 --> 2:05:27.040
 somehow it reduces the entirety of the human experience,

2:05:27.040 --> 2:05:28.520
 the same kind of obvious logic.

2:05:28.520 --> 2:05:31.720
 Like we should exercise every day in the same kind of way.

2:05:31.720 --> 2:05:34.880
 We should empathize every day.

2:05:34.880 --> 2:05:35.880
 Yeah.

2:05:35.880 --> 2:05:37.720
 You know, there are these really wonderful,

2:05:37.720 --> 2:05:41.580
 wonderful programs for teens

2:05:41.580 --> 2:05:44.160
 and sometimes also for parents of people

2:05:44.160 --> 2:05:47.480
 who've lost children in wars and in conflicts,

2:05:47.480 --> 2:05:48.940
 in political conflicts,

2:05:48.940 --> 2:05:51.540
 where they go to a bucolic setting

2:05:51.540 --> 2:05:54.020
 and they talk to each other about their experiences.

2:05:54.020 --> 2:05:59.020
 And miraculous things happen, you know?

2:05:59.120 --> 2:06:04.120
 So, you know, it's easy to sort of shrug this stuff off

2:06:04.120 --> 2:06:09.120
 It's easy to sort of shrug this stuff off

2:06:10.160 --> 2:06:12.200
 as kind of Pollyanna ish.

2:06:12.200 --> 2:06:13.800
 You know, like, what's this really gonna do?

2:06:13.800 --> 2:06:18.620
 But you have to think about,

2:06:20.120 --> 2:06:23.520
 when my daughter went to college, I gave her advice.

2:06:23.520 --> 2:06:28.520
 I said, try to be around people

2:06:29.400 --> 2:06:32.080
 who let you be the kind of person you wanna be.

2:06:32.080 --> 2:06:35.640
 We're back to free will.

2:06:35.640 --> 2:06:40.360
 You have a choice, you have a choice.

2:06:40.360 --> 2:06:41.960
 It might seem like a really hard choice.

2:06:41.960 --> 2:06:46.080
 It might seem like an unimaginably difficult choice.

2:06:46.080 --> 2:06:47.280
 You have a choice.

2:06:47.280 --> 2:06:52.280
 Do you wanna be somebody who is wrapped in fury and agony?

2:06:54.600 --> 2:06:59.280
 Or do you wanna be somebody who extends a little empathy

2:06:59.280 --> 2:07:00.100
 to somebody else?

2:07:00.100 --> 2:07:02.720
 And in the process, maybe learn something.

2:07:02.720 --> 2:07:07.440
 Curiosity is the thing that protects you.

2:07:07.440 --> 2:07:12.440
 Curiosity is the thing, it's curative curiosity.

2:07:12.460 --> 2:07:15.480
 On social media, the thing I recommend to people,

2:07:16.760 --> 2:07:20.000
 at least that's the way I've been approaching social media.

2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:22.040
 It doesn't seem to be the common approach,

2:07:22.040 --> 2:07:27.040
 but I basically give love to people

2:07:27.040 --> 2:07:30.620
 who seem to also give love to others.

2:07:30.620 --> 2:07:34.420
 So it's the same similar concept of surrounding yourself

2:07:34.420 --> 2:07:36.260
 by the people you wanna become.

2:07:36.260 --> 2:07:40.460
 And I ignore, sometimes block, but just ignore.

2:07:40.460 --> 2:07:43.260
 I don't add aggression to people

2:07:43.260 --> 2:07:46.420
 who are just constantly full of aggression

2:07:46.420 --> 2:07:48.420
 and negativity and toxicity.

2:07:48.420 --> 2:07:52.380
 There's a certain desire when somebody says something mean

2:07:52.380 --> 2:07:57.380
 to say something, to say why,

2:07:59.020 --> 2:08:01.720
 or try to alleviate the meanness and so on.

2:08:01.720 --> 2:08:03.060
 But what you're doing essentially

2:08:03.060 --> 2:08:05.620
 is you're now surrounding yourself

2:08:05.620 --> 2:08:09.220
 by that group of folks that have that negativity.

2:08:09.220 --> 2:08:11.220
 So even just the conversation.

2:08:11.220 --> 2:08:15.540
 So I think it's just so powerful

2:08:15.540 --> 2:08:18.500
 to put yourself amongst people

2:08:18.500 --> 2:08:23.500
 whose basic mode of interaction is kindness.

2:08:23.900 --> 2:08:26.980
 Because I don't know what it is,

2:08:26.980 --> 2:08:28.680
 but maybe it's the way I'm built,

2:08:28.680 --> 2:08:32.180
 is that to me is energizing for the gas tank

2:08:32.180 --> 2:08:36.380
 that then I can pull to when I start reading

2:08:36.380 --> 2:08:38.100
 The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich

2:08:38.100 --> 2:08:40.980
 and start thinking about Nazi Germany.

2:08:40.980 --> 2:08:43.620
 I can empathize with everybody involved.

2:08:43.620 --> 2:08:47.820
 I can start to make these difficult thinking

2:08:47.820 --> 2:08:52.140
 that's required to understand our little planet Earth.

2:08:52.140 --> 2:08:54.820
 Well, there is research to back up what you said.

2:08:54.820 --> 2:08:56.580
 There's research that's consistent

2:08:56.580 --> 2:08:58.500
 with your intuition there,

2:08:58.500 --> 2:09:00.660
 that there's research that shows

2:09:00.660 --> 2:09:04.060
 that being kind to other people,

2:09:04.060 --> 2:09:05.860
 doing something nice for someone else

2:09:06.900 --> 2:09:11.340
 is like making a deposit to some extent.

2:09:11.340 --> 2:09:15.860
 Because I think making a deposit

2:09:15.860 --> 2:09:17.220
 not only in their body budgets,

2:09:17.220 --> 2:09:18.820
 but also in yours.

2:09:18.820 --> 2:09:22.500
 Like people feel good when they do good things

2:09:22.500 --> 2:09:24.180
 for other people.

2:09:24.180 --> 2:09:26.060
 We are social animals.

2:09:26.060 --> 2:09:28.300
 We regulate each other's nervous systems

2:09:28.300 --> 2:09:30.780
 for better and for worse, right?

2:09:30.780 --> 2:09:35.520
 The best thing for a human nervous system is another human.

2:09:36.820 --> 2:09:40.540
 And the worst thing for a human nervous system

2:09:40.540 --> 2:09:41.820
 is another human.

2:09:41.820 --> 2:09:44.540
 So you decide, do you wanna be somebody

2:09:44.540 --> 2:09:49.540
 who makes people feel better

2:09:49.860 --> 2:09:53.200
 or do you wanna be somebody who causes people pain?

2:09:53.200 --> 2:09:58.200
 And we are more responsible for one another

2:09:58.220 --> 2:10:02.520
 than we might like or than we might want.

2:10:02.520 --> 2:10:05.460
 But remember what we said about social reality.

2:10:05.460 --> 2:10:10.460
 Social reality, there are lots of different cultural norms

2:10:10.460 --> 2:10:15.460
 about independence or collective nature of people.

2:10:20.100 --> 2:10:24.980
 But the fact is we have socially dependent nervous systems.

2:10:24.980 --> 2:10:27.620
 We evolved that way as a species.

2:10:27.620 --> 2:10:29.420
 And in this country,

2:10:29.420 --> 2:10:32.880
 we prize individual rights and freedoms.

2:10:32.880 --> 2:10:37.880
 And that is a dilemma that we have to grapple with.

2:10:38.560 --> 2:10:40.100
 And we have to do it in a way

2:10:40.100 --> 2:10:41.580
 if we're gonna be productive about it.

2:10:41.580 --> 2:10:43.180
 We have to do it in a way

2:10:43.180 --> 2:10:48.180
 that requires engaging with each other,

2:10:48.500 --> 2:10:50.340
 and which is what I understand

2:10:50.340 --> 2:10:55.340
 the founding members of this country intended.

2:10:57.700 --> 2:10:58.580
 Beautifully put.

2:10:58.580 --> 2:11:01.820
 Let me ask a few final silly questions.

2:11:01.820 --> 2:11:05.300
 So one, talked a bit about love,

2:11:05.300 --> 2:11:08.620
 but it's fun to ask somebody like you

2:11:08.620 --> 2:11:13.140
 who can effectively, from at least neuroscience perspective,

2:11:13.140 --> 2:11:15.060
 disassemble some of these romantic notions.

2:11:15.060 --> 2:11:17.540
 But what do you make of romantic love?

2:11:18.380 --> 2:11:22.020
 Why do human beings seem to fall in love?

2:11:22.020 --> 2:11:26.220
 At least a bunch of 80s hair bands have written about it.

2:11:27.740 --> 2:11:29.700
 Is that a nice feature to have?

2:11:29.700 --> 2:11:31.100
 Is that a bug?

2:11:31.100 --> 2:11:31.940
 What is it?

2:11:31.940 --> 2:11:35.100
 Well, I'm really happy that I fell in love.

2:11:35.100 --> 2:11:37.620
 I wouldn't want it any other way.

2:11:37.620 --> 2:11:38.940
 But I would say.

2:11:38.940 --> 2:11:41.740
 Is that you the person speaking or the neuroscientist?

2:11:41.740 --> 2:11:44.060
 Well, that's me the person speaking.

2:11:44.060 --> 2:11:47.460
 But I would say as a neuroscientist,

2:11:47.460 --> 2:11:51.340
 babies are born not able to regulate their own body budgets

2:11:51.340 --> 2:11:53.660
 because their brains aren't fully wired yet.

2:11:54.580 --> 2:11:59.580
 When you feed a baby, when you cuddle a baby,

2:12:00.740 --> 2:12:02.220
 everything you do with a baby

2:12:02.220 --> 2:12:04.460
 impacts that baby's body budget

2:12:04.460 --> 2:12:09.460
 and helps to wire that baby's brain

2:12:09.900 --> 2:12:13.580
 to manage eventually her own body budget to some extent.

2:12:13.580 --> 2:12:17.340
 That's the basis biologically of attachment.

2:12:20.340 --> 2:12:25.340
 Humans evolved as a species to be socially dependent,

2:12:26.780 --> 2:12:31.780
 meaning you cannot manage your body budget

2:12:31.780 --> 2:12:35.740
 on your own without a tax

2:12:35.740 --> 2:12:40.180
 that eventually you pay many years later

2:12:40.180 --> 2:12:42.740
 in terms of some metabolic illness.

2:12:43.620 --> 2:12:47.740
 Loneliness, when you break up with someone that you love

2:12:47.740 --> 2:12:52.300
 or you lose them, you feel like it's gonna kill you,

2:12:52.300 --> 2:12:53.380
 but it doesn't.

2:12:53.380 --> 2:12:55.300
 But loneliness will kill you.

2:12:55.300 --> 2:12:57.740
 It will kill you approximately,

2:12:57.740 --> 2:12:59.380
 what is it, seven years earlier?

2:12:59.380 --> 2:13:01.060
 I can't remember exactly the exact number.

2:13:01.060 --> 2:13:05.260
 It's actually in the web notes to seven and a half lessons.

2:13:05.260 --> 2:13:10.260
 But social isolation and loneliness will kill you earlier

2:13:10.460 --> 2:13:11.780
 than you would otherwise die.

2:13:11.780 --> 2:13:15.740
 And the reason why is that you didn't evolve

2:13:15.740 --> 2:13:18.540
 to manage your nervous system on your own.

2:13:18.540 --> 2:13:20.740
 And when you do, you pay a little tax

2:13:20.740 --> 2:13:24.300
 and that tax accrues very slightly over time,

2:13:24.300 --> 2:13:26.260
 over a long period of time

2:13:26.260 --> 2:13:30.620
 so that by the time you're in middle age or a little older,

2:13:30.620 --> 2:13:33.660
 you are more likely to die sooner

2:13:33.660 --> 2:13:35.260
 from some metabolic illness,

2:13:35.260 --> 2:13:38.700
 from heart disease, from diabetes, from depression.

2:13:38.700 --> 2:13:40.860
 You're more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease.

2:13:40.860 --> 2:13:45.860
 I mean, it takes a long time for that tax to accrue,

2:13:47.020 --> 2:13:47.860
 but it does.

2:13:47.860 --> 2:13:52.860
 So yes, I think it's a good thing for people to fall in love.

2:13:53.820 --> 2:13:58.300
 But I think the funny view of it is that it's clear

2:13:58.300 --> 2:14:01.900
 that humans need the social attachment

2:14:01.900 --> 2:14:05.580
 to, what is it, manage their nervous system

2:14:05.580 --> 2:14:08.500
 as you're describing.

2:14:08.500 --> 2:14:12.300
 And the reason you wanna stay with somebody for a long time

2:14:12.300 --> 2:14:16.500
 is so you don't have, is the novelty is very costly for.

2:14:16.500 --> 2:14:18.580
 Well, now you're mixing thing.

2:14:18.580 --> 2:14:21.540
 Now you're, you know, you have to decide whether.

2:14:21.540 --> 2:14:25.180
 But what I would say is when you lose someone you love,

2:14:25.180 --> 2:14:29.740
 it feels like you've lost a part of you.

2:14:29.740 --> 2:14:31.340
 And that's because you have.

2:14:32.260 --> 2:14:36.020
 You've lost someone who was contributing

2:14:36.020 --> 2:14:37.340
 to your body budget.

2:14:37.340 --> 2:14:40.500
 We are the caretakers of one another's nervous systems,

2:14:40.500 --> 2:14:41.780
 like it or not.

2:14:41.780 --> 2:14:46.780
 And out of that comes very deep feelings of attachment,

2:14:47.260 --> 2:14:50.220
 some of which are romantic love.

2:14:50.220 --> 2:14:55.220
 Are you afraid of your own mortality?

2:14:55.940 --> 2:14:57.420
 We're two humans sitting here.

2:14:57.420 --> 2:15:01.780
 Do you think, do you ponder your own mortality?

2:15:01.780 --> 2:15:05.580
 I mean, somebody thinks about your brain a lot.

2:15:05.580 --> 2:15:10.580
 It seems one of the more terrifying or, I don't know.

2:15:12.700 --> 2:15:13.860
 I don't know how to feel about it,

2:15:13.860 --> 2:15:16.140
 but it seems to be one of the most definitive aspects

2:15:16.140 --> 2:15:18.500
 of life is that it ends.

2:15:18.500 --> 2:15:21.340
 It's a complicated answer, but I think the best I can do

2:15:21.340 --> 2:15:24.220
 in a short snippet would be to say,

2:15:24.220 --> 2:15:27.820
 for a very long time, I did not fear my own mortality.

2:15:27.820 --> 2:15:32.820
 I feared pain and suffering.

2:15:33.980 --> 2:15:36.060
 So that's what I feared.

2:15:36.060 --> 2:15:38.740
 I feared being harmed or dying in a way

2:15:38.740 --> 2:15:39.980
 that would be painful.

2:15:41.900 --> 2:15:45.580
 But I didn't fear having my life be over.

2:15:45.580 --> 2:15:50.580
 Now, as a mother, I think I fear dying

2:15:54.380 --> 2:15:59.380
 before my daughter is ready to be without me.

2:16:03.340 --> 2:16:04.580
 That's what I fear.

2:16:05.460 --> 2:16:10.380
 It's, that's really what I fear.

2:16:10.380 --> 2:16:13.820
 And frankly, honestly, I fear my husband dying before me

2:16:13.820 --> 2:16:15.620
 much more than I fear my own death.

2:16:16.700 --> 2:16:19.300
 There's that love and social attachment again.

2:16:19.300 --> 2:16:23.020
 Yeah, because I know it's just gonna,

2:16:23.020 --> 2:16:25.220
 I'm gonna feel like I wish I was dead.

2:16:27.020 --> 2:16:29.220
 A final question about life.

2:16:29.220 --> 2:16:31.300
 What do you think is the meaning of it all?

2:16:32.220 --> 2:16:33.540
 What's the meaning of life?

2:16:36.300 --> 2:16:38.780
 Yeah, I think that there isn't one meaning of life.

2:16:38.780 --> 2:16:41.020
 There's like many meanings of life.

2:16:41.020 --> 2:16:43.860
 And you use different ones on different days.

2:16:43.860 --> 2:16:45.260
 But for me.

2:16:45.260 --> 2:16:46.300
 Depending on the day.

2:16:46.300 --> 2:16:47.140
 Depending on the day.

2:16:47.140 --> 2:16:51.700
 But for me, I would say sometimes the meaning of life

2:16:51.700 --> 2:16:55.780
 is to understand, to make meaning actually.

2:16:55.780 --> 2:16:58.540
 The meaning of life is to make meaning.

2:16:58.540 --> 2:16:59.940
 Sometimes it's that.

2:16:59.940 --> 2:17:03.660
 Sometimes it's to leave the world

2:17:03.660 --> 2:17:06.460
 just slightly a little bit better

2:17:06.460 --> 2:17:09.860
 than like the Johnny Appleseed view, you know?

2:17:09.860 --> 2:17:14.860
 Sometimes the meaning of life is to clear the path

2:17:21.580 --> 2:17:24.620
 for my daughter or for my students.

2:17:26.740 --> 2:17:28.340
 So sometimes it's that.

2:17:28.340 --> 2:17:30.380
 And sometimes it's just,

2:17:34.380 --> 2:17:38.700
 even in moments where you're looking at the sky

2:17:38.700 --> 2:17:42.780
 or you're by the ocean.

2:17:42.780 --> 2:17:45.180
 Or sometimes for me it's even like

2:17:45.180 --> 2:17:50.180
 I'll see a weed poking out of a crack

2:17:51.060 --> 2:17:52.980
 in a sidewalk, you know?

2:17:52.980 --> 2:17:56.620
 And you just have this overwhelming sense

2:17:56.620 --> 2:18:01.620
 of the wonder of the world.

2:18:03.300 --> 2:18:06.580
 Like the world is, just like the physical world

2:18:06.580 --> 2:18:11.580
 is so wondrous and you just get very immersed

2:18:12.780 --> 2:18:17.780
 in the moment, like the sensation of the moment.

2:18:18.220 --> 2:18:19.860
 Sometimes that's the meaning of life.

2:18:19.860 --> 2:18:21.740
 I don't think there's one meaning of life.

2:18:21.740 --> 2:18:24.460
 I think it's a population of instances

2:18:24.460 --> 2:18:27.540
 just like any other category.

2:18:28.460 --> 2:18:30.820
 I don't think there's a better way to end it, Lisa.

2:18:30.820 --> 2:18:35.820
 The first time we spoke is I think if not the,

2:18:35.820 --> 2:18:39.980
 then one of, I think it's the first conversation I had

2:18:39.980 --> 2:18:41.740
 that basically launched this podcast.

2:18:41.740 --> 2:18:43.700
 Yeah, that's actually the first conversation

2:18:43.700 --> 2:18:45.660
 I've had that launched this podcast.

2:18:45.660 --> 2:18:49.180
 And now we get to finally do it the right way.

2:18:49.180 --> 2:18:50.580
 It's a huge honor to talk to you,

2:18:50.580 --> 2:18:51.940
 that you spent time with me.

2:18:53.020 --> 2:18:56.620
 I can't wait for hopefully the many more books you write.

2:18:56.620 --> 2:19:00.500
 Certainly can't wait to, I already read this book,

2:19:00.500 --> 2:19:02.140
 but I can't wait to listen to it

2:19:02.140 --> 2:19:05.980
 because as you said offline that you're reading it

2:19:05.980 --> 2:19:07.460
 and I think you have a great voice.

2:19:07.460 --> 2:19:10.020
 You have a great, I don't know what the nice way to put it,

2:19:10.020 --> 2:19:14.660
 but maybe NPR voice in the best version of what that is.

2:19:14.660 --> 2:19:16.540
 So thanks again for talking today.

2:19:16.540 --> 2:19:17.380
 Oh, it's my pleasure.

2:19:17.380 --> 2:19:19.980
