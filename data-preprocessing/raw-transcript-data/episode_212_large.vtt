00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
 The following is a conversation with Yosha Bach,

00:02.720 --> 00:04.940
 his second time on the podcast.

00:04.940 --> 00:08.540
 Yosha is one of the most fascinating minds in the world,

00:08.540 --> 00:10.620
 exploring the nature of intelligence,

00:10.620 --> 00:14.500
 cognition, computation, and consciousness.

00:14.500 --> 00:17.700

00:26.740 --> 00:28.980
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast,

00:28.980 --> 00:32.420
 and here is my conversation with Yosha Bach.

00:33.340 --> 00:35.180
 Thank you for once again coming on

00:35.180 --> 00:38.220
 to this particular Russian program

00:38.220 --> 00:40.740
 and sticking to the theme of a Russian program.

00:40.740 --> 00:43.100
 Let's start with the darkest of topics.

00:43.100 --> 00:43.940
 Kriviyat.

00:45.220 --> 00:48.380
 So this is inspired by one of your tweets.

00:48.380 --> 00:50.900
 You wrote that, quote,

00:50.900 --> 00:52.660
 when life feels unbearable,

00:53.740 --> 00:56.620
 I remind myself that I'm not a person.

00:56.620 --> 00:58.940
 I am a piece of software running on the brain

00:58.940 --> 01:01.500
 of a random ape for a few decades.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.360
 It's not the worst brain to run on.

01:04.540 --> 01:07.740
 Have you experienced low points in your life?

01:07.740 --> 01:09.780
 Have you experienced depression?

01:09.780 --> 01:12.140
 Of course, we all experience low points in our life,

01:12.140 --> 01:15.340
 and we get appalled by the things,

01:15.340 --> 01:17.060
 by the ugliness of stuff around us.

01:17.060 --> 01:21.300
 We might get desperate about our lack of self regulation,

01:21.300 --> 01:24.580
 and sometimes life is hard,

01:24.580 --> 01:27.900
 and I suspect you don't get to your life,

01:27.900 --> 01:30.700
 nobody does, to get through their life without low points

01:30.700 --> 01:33.740
 and without moments where they're despairing.

01:33.740 --> 01:37.800
 And I thought that let's capture this state

01:37.800 --> 01:40.140
 and how to deal with that state.

01:40.140 --> 01:43.120
 And I found that very often you realize

01:43.120 --> 01:44.860
 that when you stop taking things personally,

01:44.860 --> 01:48.980
 when you realize that this notion of a person is a fiction,

01:48.980 --> 01:50.700
 similar as it is in Westworld,

01:50.700 --> 01:53.300
 where the robots realize that their memories and desires

01:53.300 --> 01:55.840
 are the stuff that keeps them in the loop,

01:55.840 --> 01:59.100
 and they don't have to act on those memories and desires,

01:59.100 --> 02:02.540
 that our memories and expectations is what make us unhappy.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.200
 And the present really does.

02:04.200 --> 02:08.300
 The day in which we are, for the most part, it's okay, right?

02:08.300 --> 02:11.260
 When we are sitting here, right here, right now,

02:11.260 --> 02:13.100
 we can choose how we feel.

02:13.100 --> 02:16.740
 And the thing that affects us is the expectation

02:16.740 --> 02:18.760
 that something is going to be different

02:18.760 --> 02:19.920
 from what we want it to be,

02:19.920 --> 02:21.860
 or the memory that something was different

02:21.860 --> 02:24.140
 from what you wanted it to be.

02:24.140 --> 02:27.340
 And once we basically zoom out from all this,

02:27.340 --> 02:28.980
 what's left is not a person.

02:28.980 --> 02:32.300
 What's left is this state of being conscious,

02:32.300 --> 02:33.620
 which is a software state.

02:33.620 --> 02:35.680
 And software doesn't have an identity.

02:35.680 --> 02:36.780
 It's a physical law.

02:37.820 --> 02:39.820
 And it's a law that acts in all of us,

02:39.820 --> 02:42.300
 and it's embedded in a suitable substrate.

02:42.300 --> 02:43.780
 And we didn't pick that substrate, right?

02:43.780 --> 02:46.940
 We are mostly randomly instantiated on it.

02:46.940 --> 02:48.900
 And they're all these individuals,

02:48.900 --> 02:51.740
 and everybody has to be one of them.

02:51.740 --> 02:54.220
 And eventually you're stuck on one of them,

02:54.220 --> 02:56.340
 and have to deal with that.

02:56.340 --> 02:59.080
 So you're like a leaf floating down the river.

02:59.080 --> 03:01.340
 You just have to accept that there's a river,

03:01.340 --> 03:03.820
 and you just float wherever it takes you.

03:03.820 --> 03:04.660
 You don't have to do this.

03:04.660 --> 03:08.140
 The thing is that the illusion that you are an agent

03:08.140 --> 03:09.500
 is a construct.

03:09.500 --> 03:13.100
 What part of that is actually under your control?

03:13.100 --> 03:15.260
 And I think that our consciousness

03:15.260 --> 03:18.460
 is largely a control model for our own attention.

03:18.460 --> 03:21.160
 So we notice where we are looking,

03:21.160 --> 03:22.740
 and we can influence what we're looking,

03:22.740 --> 03:24.180
 how we are disambiguating things,

03:24.180 --> 03:26.580
 how we put things together in our mind.

03:26.580 --> 03:28.780
 And the whole system that runs us

03:28.780 --> 03:30.940
 is this big cybernetic motivational system.

03:30.940 --> 03:32.940
 So we're basically like a little monkey

03:32.940 --> 03:34.940
 sitting on top of an elephant,

03:34.940 --> 03:37.540
 and we can put this elephant here and there

03:37.540 --> 03:39.360
 to go this way or that way.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.020
 And we might have the illusion that we are the elephant,

03:42.020 --> 03:43.460
 or that we are telling it what to do.

03:43.460 --> 03:45.620
 And sometimes we notice that it walks

03:45.620 --> 03:47.460
 into a completely different direction.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.000
 And we didn't set this thing up.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.620
 It just is the situation that we find ourselves in.

03:52.620 --> 03:55.220
 How much prodding can we actually do of the elephant?

03:56.420 --> 03:57.380
 A lot.

03:57.380 --> 04:00.660
 But I think that our consciousness

04:00.660 --> 04:03.000
 cannot create the motive force.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.340
 Is the elephant consciousness in this metaphor?

04:05.340 --> 04:07.940
 No, the monkey is the consciousness.

04:07.940 --> 04:09.340
 The monkey is the attentional system

04:09.340 --> 04:10.460
 that is observing things.

04:10.460 --> 04:12.380
 There is a large perceptual system

04:12.380 --> 04:14.300
 combined with a motivational system

04:14.300 --> 04:17.260
 that is actually providing the interface to everything

04:17.260 --> 04:18.660
 and our own consciousness.

04:18.660 --> 04:21.820
 I think is the tool that directs the attention

04:21.820 --> 04:24.740
 of that system, which means it singles out features

04:24.740 --> 04:26.980
 and performs conditional operations

04:26.980 --> 04:28.900
 for which it needs an index memory.

04:28.900 --> 04:31.420
 But this index memory is what we perceive

04:31.420 --> 04:32.740
 as our stream of consciousness.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.900
 But the consciousness is not in charge.

04:34.900 --> 04:35.860
 That's an illusion.

04:35.860 --> 04:40.300
 So everything outside of that consciousness

04:40.300 --> 04:41.380
 is the elephant.

04:41.380 --> 04:43.060
 So it's the physics of the universe,

04:43.060 --> 04:46.140
 but it's also society that's outside of your...

04:46.140 --> 04:48.300
 I would say the elephant is the agent.

04:48.300 --> 04:51.300
 So there is an environment to which the agent is stomping

04:51.300 --> 04:55.100
 and you are influencing a little part of that agent.

04:55.100 --> 04:58.980
 So is the agent a single human being?

04:58.980 --> 05:02.340
 Which object has agency?

05:02.340 --> 05:03.820
 That's an interesting question.

05:03.820 --> 05:06.140
 I think a way to think about an agent

05:06.140 --> 05:09.660
 is that it's a controller with a set point generator.

05:10.500 --> 05:13.020
 The notion of a controller comes from cybernetics

05:13.020 --> 05:14.380
 and control theory.

05:14.380 --> 05:17.780
 Control system consists out of a system

05:17.780 --> 05:20.860
 that is regulating some value

05:20.860 --> 05:23.980
 and the deviation of that value from a set point.

05:23.980 --> 05:27.500
 And it has a sensor that measures the system's deviation

05:27.500 --> 05:30.060
 from that set point and an effector

05:30.060 --> 05:32.580
 that can be parametrized by the controller.

05:32.580 --> 05:35.500
 So the controller tells the effector to do a certain thing.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.460
 And the goal is to reduce the distance

05:38.460 --> 05:40.860
 between the set point and the current value of the system.

05:40.860 --> 05:41.700
 And there's an environment

05:41.700 --> 05:43.580
 which disturbs the regulated system,

05:43.580 --> 05:45.580
 which brings it away from that set point.

05:45.580 --> 05:47.860
 So simplest case is a thermostat.

05:47.860 --> 05:49.100
 The thermostat is really simple

05:49.100 --> 05:50.260
 because it doesn't have a model.

05:50.260 --> 05:52.380
 The thermostat is only trying to minimize

05:52.380 --> 05:54.940
 the set point deviation in the next moment.

05:55.780 --> 05:58.740
 And if you want to minimize the set point deviation

05:58.740 --> 06:00.860
 over a longer time span, you need to integrate it.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.660
 You need to model what is going to happen.

06:03.660 --> 06:05.700
 So for instance, when you think about

06:05.700 --> 06:08.220
 that your set point is to be comfortable in life,

06:08.220 --> 06:11.420
 maybe you need to make yourself uncomfortable first, right?

06:11.420 --> 06:14.060
 So you need to make a model of what's going to happen when.

06:14.060 --> 06:18.020
 And this is task of the controller is to use its sensors

06:18.020 --> 06:20.540
 to measure the state of the environment

06:20.540 --> 06:22.900
 and the system that is being regulated

06:22.900 --> 06:24.900
 and figure out what to do.

06:24.900 --> 06:27.620
 And if the task is complex enough,

06:27.620 --> 06:30.100
 the set points are complicated enough.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.540
 And if the controller has enough capacity

06:32.540 --> 06:34.940
 and enough sensor feedback,

06:34.940 --> 06:37.340
 then the task of the controller is to make a model

06:37.340 --> 06:39.180
 of the entire universe that it's in,

06:39.180 --> 06:42.300
 the conditions under which it exists and of itself.

06:42.300 --> 06:43.940
 And this is a very complex agent.

06:43.940 --> 06:45.820
 And we are in that category.

06:45.820 --> 06:49.460
 And an agent is not necessarily a thing in the universe.

06:49.460 --> 06:51.700
 It's a class of models that we use

06:51.700 --> 06:54.580
 to interpret aspects of the universe.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.820
 And when we notice the environment around us,

06:57.820 --> 06:59.460
 a lot of things only make sense

06:59.460 --> 07:01.060
 at the level that should be entangled with them

07:01.060 --> 07:03.340
 if we interpret them as control systems

07:03.340 --> 07:04.700
 that make models of the world

07:04.700 --> 07:07.380
 and try to minimize their own set points.

07:07.380 --> 07:10.580
 So the models are the agents.

07:10.580 --> 07:12.580
 The agent is a class of model.

07:12.580 --> 07:14.660
 And we notice that we are an agent ourselves.

07:14.660 --> 07:17.780
 We are the agent that is using our own control model

07:17.780 --> 07:18.820
 to perform actions.

07:18.820 --> 07:22.100
 We notice we produce a change in the model

07:22.100 --> 07:23.460
 and things in the world change.

07:23.460 --> 07:26.740
 And this is how we discover the idea that we have a body,

07:26.740 --> 07:28.260
 that we are situated environment,

07:28.260 --> 07:31.140
 and that we have a first person perspective.

07:31.140 --> 07:34.980
 Still don't understand what's the best way to think

07:34.980 --> 07:39.820
 of which object has agency with respect to human beings.

07:39.820 --> 07:41.540
 Is it the body?

07:41.540 --> 07:43.420
 Is it the brain?

07:43.420 --> 07:46.020
 Is it the contents of the brain as agency?

07:46.020 --> 07:49.020
 Like what's the actuators that you're referring to?

07:49.020 --> 07:52.100
 What is the controller and where does it reside?

07:52.100 --> 07:54.100
 Or is it these impossible things?

07:54.100 --> 07:57.740
 Because I keep trying to ground it to space time,

07:57.740 --> 08:01.580
 the three dimension of space and the one dimension of time.

08:01.580 --> 08:04.580
 What's the agent in that for humans?

08:04.580 --> 08:06.020
 There is not just one.

08:06.020 --> 08:08.260
 It depends on the way in which you're looking

08:08.260 --> 08:10.060
 at this thing in which you're framing it.

08:10.060 --> 08:13.540
 Imagine that you are, say Angela Merkel,

08:13.540 --> 08:16.660
 and you are acting on behalf of Germany.

08:16.660 --> 08:19.820
 Then you could say that Germany is the agent.

08:19.820 --> 08:21.580
 And in the mind of Angela Merkel,

08:21.580 --> 08:23.540
 she is Germany to some extent,

08:23.540 --> 08:25.660
 because in the way in which she acts,

08:25.660 --> 08:28.060
 the destiny of Germany changes.

08:28.060 --> 08:29.700
 There are things that she can change

08:29.700 --> 08:33.580
 that basically affect the behavior of that nation state.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.060
 Okay, so it's hierarchies of,

08:35.060 --> 08:37.460
 to go to another one of your tweets

08:37.460 --> 08:42.380
 with I think you were playfully mocking Jeff Hawkins

08:42.380 --> 08:44.420
 with saying his brain's all the way down.

08:45.820 --> 08:49.020
 So it's like, it's agents all the way down.

08:49.020 --> 08:51.780
 It's agents made up of agents, made up of agents.

08:51.780 --> 08:54.700
 Like if Angela Merkel's Germany

08:54.700 --> 08:56.540
 and Germany's made up a bunch of people

08:56.540 --> 08:58.860
 and the people are themselves agents

08:58.860 --> 09:01.060
 in some kind of context.

09:01.060 --> 09:04.900
 And then people are made up of cells, each individual.

09:04.900 --> 09:07.220
 So is it agents all the way down?

09:07.220 --> 09:08.900
 I suspect that has to be like this

09:08.900 --> 09:12.900
 in a world where things are self organizing.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.660
 Most of the complexity that we are looking at,

09:15.660 --> 09:18.540
 everything in life is about self organization.

09:18.540 --> 09:23.540
 So I think up from the level of life, you have agents.

09:24.220 --> 09:27.460
 And below life, you rarely have agents

09:27.460 --> 09:30.060
 because sometimes you have control systems

09:30.060 --> 09:31.580
 that emerge randomly in nature

09:31.580 --> 09:33.740
 and try to achieve a set point,

09:33.740 --> 09:36.660
 but they're not that interesting agents that make models.

09:36.660 --> 09:39.580
 And because to make an interesting model of the world,

09:39.580 --> 09:42.380
 you typically need a system that is true and complete.

09:42.380 --> 09:44.100
 Can I ask you a personal question?

09:46.140 --> 09:48.740
 What's the line between life and non life?

09:48.740 --> 09:52.300
 It's personal because you're a life form.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.740
 So what do you think in this emerging complexity,

09:55.740 --> 09:57.980
 at which point does the things that are being living

09:57.980 --> 09:59.100
 and have agency?

10:00.220 --> 10:01.900
 Personally, I think that the simplest answer

10:01.900 --> 10:04.540
 that is that life is cells because...

10:04.540 --> 10:05.380
 Life is what?

10:05.380 --> 10:06.220
 Cells.

10:06.220 --> 10:07.060
 Biological cells.

10:07.060 --> 10:07.900
 Biological cells.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.420
 So it's a particular kind of principle

10:09.420 --> 10:11.860
 that we have discovered to exist in nature.

10:11.860 --> 10:14.540
 It's modular stuff that consists

10:14.540 --> 10:17.820
 out of basically this DNA tape

10:17.820 --> 10:20.180
 with a read write head on top of it,

10:20.180 --> 10:23.220
 that is able to perform arbitrary computations

10:23.220 --> 10:25.300
 and state transitions within the cell.

10:25.300 --> 10:27.380
 And it's combined with a membrane

10:27.380 --> 10:30.540
 that insulates the cell from its environment.

10:30.540 --> 10:34.780
 And there are chemical reactions inside of the cell

10:34.780 --> 10:36.300
 that are in disequilibrium.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.740
 And the cell is running in such a way

10:38.740 --> 10:41.460
 that this disequilibrium doesn't disappear.

10:41.460 --> 10:46.260
 And the cell goes into an equilibrium state, it dies.

10:46.260 --> 10:50.100
 And it requires something like an neck entropy extractor

10:50.100 --> 10:51.900
 to maintain this disequilibrium.

10:51.900 --> 10:55.700
 So it's able to harvest like entropy from its environment

10:55.700 --> 10:57.820
 and keep itself running.

10:57.820 --> 11:00.540
 Yeah, so there's information and there's a wall

11:00.540 --> 11:04.100
 to maintain this disequilibrium.

11:04.100 --> 11:06.660
 But isn't this very earth centric?

11:06.660 --> 11:08.740
 Like what you're referring to as a...

11:08.740 --> 11:10.660
 I'm not making a normative notion.

11:10.660 --> 11:13.100
 You could say that there are probably other things

11:13.100 --> 11:16.380
 in the universe that are cell like and life like,

11:16.380 --> 11:17.860
 and you could also call them life,

11:17.860 --> 11:21.220
 but eventually it's just a willingness

11:21.220 --> 11:23.820
 to find an agreement of how to use the terms.

11:23.820 --> 11:26.580
 I like cells because it's completely coextential

11:26.580 --> 11:28.500
 with the way that we use the word

11:28.500 --> 11:30.340
 even before we knew about cells.

11:30.340 --> 11:32.380
 So people were pointing at some stuff

11:32.380 --> 11:34.260
 and saying, this is somehow animate.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.620
 And this is very different from the non animate stuff.

11:36.620 --> 11:38.900
 And what's the difference between the living

11:38.900 --> 11:40.140
 and the dead stuff.

11:40.140 --> 11:42.860
 And it's mostly whether the cells are working or not.

11:42.860 --> 11:45.340
 And also this boundary of life,

11:45.340 --> 11:46.820
 where we say that for instance, the virus

11:46.820 --> 11:48.820
 is basically an information packet

11:48.820 --> 11:51.500
 that is subverting the cell and not life by itself.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.100
 That makes sense to me.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.860
 And it's somewhat arbitrary.

11:55.860 --> 11:57.940
 You could of course say that systems

11:57.940 --> 12:00.140
 that permanently maintain a disequilibrium

12:00.140 --> 12:03.340
 and can self replicate are always life.

12:03.340 --> 12:06.460
 And maybe that's a useful definition too,

12:06.460 --> 12:10.420
 but this is eventually just how you want to use the word.

12:10.420 --> 12:12.620
 Is it so useful for conversation,

12:12.620 --> 12:17.340
 but is it somehow fundamental to the universe?

12:17.340 --> 12:19.300
 Do you think there's a actual line

12:19.300 --> 12:21.860
 to eventually be drawn between life and non life?

12:21.860 --> 12:24.300
 Or is it all a kind of continuum?

12:24.300 --> 12:25.460
 I don't think it's a continuum,

12:25.460 --> 12:28.140
 but there's nothing magical that is happening.

12:28.140 --> 12:31.140
 Living systems are a certain type of machine.

12:31.140 --> 12:32.980
 What about non living systems?

12:32.980 --> 12:34.300
 Is it also a machine?

12:34.300 --> 12:35.980
 There are non living machines,

12:35.980 --> 12:38.540
 but the question is at which point is a system

12:38.540 --> 12:43.100
 able to perform arbitrary state transitions

12:43.100 --> 12:44.940
 to make representations.

12:44.940 --> 12:46.820
 And living things can do this.

12:46.820 --> 12:48.980
 And of course we can also build non living things

12:48.980 --> 12:52.220
 that can do this, but we don't know anything in nature

12:52.220 --> 12:56.180
 that is not a cell and is not created by still alive

12:56.180 --> 12:58.580
 that is able to do that.

12:58.580 --> 13:02.860
 Not only do we not know,

13:02.860 --> 13:05.980
 I don't think we have the tools to see otherwise.

13:05.980 --> 13:10.980
 I always worry that we look at the world too narrowly.

13:11.140 --> 13:14.900
 Like there could be life of a very different kind

13:14.900 --> 13:18.860
 right under our noses that we're just not seeing

13:18.860 --> 13:21.700
 because we're not either limitations

13:21.700 --> 13:23.260
 of our cognitive capacity,

13:23.260 --> 13:26.980
 or we're just not open minded enough

13:26.980 --> 13:28.380
 either with the tools of science

13:28.380 --> 13:31.100
 or just the tools of our mind.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.020
 Yeah, that's possible.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.060
 I find this thought very fascinating.

13:35.060 --> 13:39.020
 And I suspect that many of us ask ourselves since childhood,

13:39.020 --> 13:40.580
 what are the things that we are missing?

13:40.580 --> 13:43.660
 What kind of systems and interconnections exist

13:43.660 --> 13:46.380
 that are outside of our gaze?

13:47.900 --> 13:51.140
 But we are looking for it

13:51.140 --> 13:55.140
 and physics doesn't have much room at the moment

13:55.140 --> 13:59.580
 for opening up something that would not violate

13:59.580 --> 14:01.940
 the conservation of information as we know it.

14:03.300 --> 14:06.860
 Yeah, but I wonder about time scale and scale,

14:06.860 --> 14:11.860
 spatial scale, whether we just need to open up our idea

14:11.860 --> 14:15.300
 of what, like how life presents itself.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.860
 It could be operating in a much slower time scale,

14:17.860 --> 14:20.060
 a much faster time scale.

14:20.060 --> 14:23.940
 And it's almost sad to think that there's all this life

14:23.940 --> 14:25.340
 around us that we're not seeing

14:25.340 --> 14:29.220
 because we're just not like thinking

14:29.220 --> 14:34.220
 in terms of the right scale, both time and space.

14:34.380 --> 14:36.060
 What is your definition of life?

14:36.060 --> 14:37.660
 What do you understand as life?

14:40.780 --> 14:44.500
 Entities of sufficiently high complexity

14:44.500 --> 14:46.140
 that are full of surprises.

14:46.140 --> 14:51.140
 I don't know, I don't have a free will.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.620
 So that just came out of my mouth.

14:55.620 --> 14:57.260
 I'm not sure that even makes sense.

14:57.260 --> 14:59.180
 There's certain characteristics.

14:59.180 --> 15:04.140
 So complexity seems to be a necessary property of life.

15:04.140 --> 15:09.140
 And I almost want to say it has ability

15:09.980 --> 15:11.820
 to do something unexpected.

15:13.340 --> 15:15.460
 It seems to me that life is the main source

15:15.460 --> 15:16.900
 of complexity on earth.

15:18.660 --> 15:19.500
 Yes.

15:19.500 --> 15:22.060
 And complexity is basically a bridgehead

15:22.060 --> 15:27.220
 that order builds into chaos by modeling,

15:27.220 --> 15:29.020
 by processing information in such a way

15:29.020 --> 15:31.220
 that you can perform reactions

15:31.220 --> 15:33.780
 that would not be possible for dump systems.

15:33.780 --> 15:36.020
 And this means that you can harvest neck entropy

15:36.020 --> 15:37.780
 that dump systems cannot harvest.

15:37.780 --> 15:40.140
 And this is what complexity is mostly about.

15:40.140 --> 15:45.060
 In some sense, the purpose of life is to create complexity.

15:45.060 --> 15:46.020
 Yeah.

15:46.020 --> 15:46.860
 Increasing.

15:46.860 --> 15:51.860
 I mean, there seems to be some kind of universal drive

15:52.340 --> 15:54.820
 towards increasing pockets of complexity.

15:56.180 --> 15:57.580
 I don't know what that is.

15:57.580 --> 16:00.020
 That seems to be like a fundamental,

16:00.020 --> 16:02.340
 I don't know if it's a property of the universe

16:02.340 --> 16:05.860
 or it's just a consequence of the way the universe works,

16:05.860 --> 16:08.700
 but there seems to be this small pockets

16:08.700 --> 16:11.380
 of emergent complexity that builds on top of each other

16:11.380 --> 16:15.380
 and starts having like greater and greater complexity

16:15.380 --> 16:17.980
 by having like a hierarchy of complexity.

16:17.980 --> 16:20.700
 Little organisms building up a little society

16:20.700 --> 16:24.060
 that then operates almost as an individual organism itself.

16:24.060 --> 16:27.660
 And all of a sudden you have Germany and Merkel.

16:27.660 --> 16:28.860
 Well, that's not obvious to me.

16:28.860 --> 16:32.500
 Everything that goes up has to come down at some point.

16:32.500 --> 16:36.500
 So if you see this big exponential curve somewhere,

16:36.500 --> 16:39.380
 it's usually the beginning of an S curve

16:39.380 --> 16:41.420
 where something eventually reaches saturation.

16:41.420 --> 16:43.820
 And the S curve is the beginning of some kind of bump

16:43.820 --> 16:45.500
 that goes down again.

16:45.500 --> 16:49.180
 And there is just this thing that when you are

16:49.180 --> 16:53.220
 in sight of an evolution of life,

16:53.220 --> 16:55.820
 you are on top of a puddle of negentropy

16:55.820 --> 16:58.900
 that is being sucked dry by life.

16:58.900 --> 17:00.660
 And during that happening,

17:00.660 --> 17:02.940
 you see an increase in complexity

17:02.940 --> 17:04.780
 because life forms are competing with each other

17:04.780 --> 17:09.340
 to get more and more finer and finer corner

17:09.340 --> 17:11.620
 of that negentropy extraction.

17:11.620 --> 17:13.900
 I feel like that's a gradual beautiful process

17:13.900 --> 17:18.100
 like that's almost follows a process akin to evolution.

17:18.100 --> 17:22.900
 And the way it comes down is not the same way it came up.

17:22.900 --> 17:26.460
 The way it comes down is usually harshly and quickly.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.620
 So usually there's some kind of catastrophic event.

17:30.620 --> 17:32.380
 The Roman Empire took a long time.

17:32.380 --> 17:36.340
 But would that be,

17:36.340 --> 17:39.420
 would you classify this as a decrease in complexity though?

17:39.420 --> 17:40.260
 Yes.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.900
 I think that this size of the cities that could be fed

17:42.900 --> 17:44.740
 has decreased dramatically.

17:44.740 --> 17:47.820
 And you could see that the quality of the art decreased

17:47.820 --> 17:49.940
 and it did so gradually.

17:49.940 --> 17:53.260
 And maybe future generations,

17:53.260 --> 17:55.660
 when they look at the history of the United States

17:55.660 --> 17:57.380
 in the 21st century,

17:57.380 --> 17:59.140
 will also talk about the gradual decline,

17:59.140 --> 18:04.140
 not something that suddenly happens.

18:05.620 --> 18:07.700
 Do you have a sense of where we are?

18:07.700 --> 18:09.740
 Are we on the exponential rise?

18:09.740 --> 18:11.260
 Are we at the peak?

18:11.260 --> 18:15.740
 Or are we at the downslope of the United States empire?

18:15.740 --> 18:18.460
 It's very hard to say from a single human perspective,

18:18.460 --> 18:23.460
 but it seems to me that we are probably at the peak.

18:25.380 --> 18:28.100
 I think that's probably the definition of like optimism

18:28.100 --> 18:29.620
 and cynicism.

18:29.620 --> 18:31.540
 So my nature of optimism is,

18:31.540 --> 18:32.940
 I think we're on the rise.

18:36.940 --> 18:39.300
 I think this is just all a matter of perspective.

18:39.300 --> 18:40.140
 Nobody knows,

18:40.140 --> 18:43.260
 but I do think that erring on the side of optimism,

18:43.260 --> 18:45.420
 like you need a sufficient number,

18:45.420 --> 18:47.460
 you need a minimum number of optimists

18:47.460 --> 18:50.980
 in order to make that up thing actually work.

18:50.980 --> 18:53.620
 And so I tend to be on the side of the optimists.

18:53.620 --> 18:56.540
 I think that we are basically a species of grasshoppers

18:56.540 --> 18:58.620
 that have turned into locusts.

18:58.620 --> 19:00.740
 And when you are in that locust mode,

19:00.740 --> 19:04.100
 you see an amazing rise of population numbers

19:04.100 --> 19:07.020
 and of the complexity of the interactions

19:07.020 --> 19:08.780
 between the individuals.

19:08.780 --> 19:12.860
 But it's ultimately the question is, is it sustainable?

19:12.860 --> 19:16.140
 See, I think we're a bunch of lions and tigers

19:16.140 --> 19:18.860
 that have become domesticated cats,

19:20.220 --> 19:21.420
 to use a different metaphor.

19:21.420 --> 19:24.300
 As I'm not exactly sure we're so destructive,

19:24.300 --> 19:27.820
 we're just softer and nicer and lazier.

19:27.820 --> 19:29.900
 But I think we have monkeys and not the cats.

19:29.900 --> 19:32.460
 And if you look at the monkeys, they are very busy.

19:33.620 --> 19:35.820
 The ones that have a lot of sex, those monkeys?

19:35.820 --> 19:37.180
 Not just the bonobos.

19:37.180 --> 19:38.940
 I think that all the monkeys are basically

19:38.940 --> 19:41.340
 a discontent species that always needs to meddle.

19:42.700 --> 19:44.180
 Well, the gorillas seem to have

19:44.180 --> 19:45.900
 a little bit more of a structure,

19:45.900 --> 19:48.260
 but it's a different part of the tree.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.900
 Okay, you mentioned the elephant

19:52.900 --> 19:55.660
 and the monkey riding the elephant.

19:55.660 --> 19:58.700
 And consciousness is the monkey.

20:00.300 --> 20:03.180
 And there's some prodding that the monkey gets to do.

20:03.180 --> 20:05.180
 And sometimes the elephant listens.

20:06.180 --> 20:08.940
 I heard you got into some contentious,

20:08.940 --> 20:09.820
 maybe you can correct me,

20:09.820 --> 20:11.540
 but I heard you got into some contentious

20:11.540 --> 20:12.900
 free will discussions.

20:13.900 --> 20:16.100
 Is this with Sam Harris or something like that?

20:16.100 --> 20:17.300
 Not that I know of.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.460
 Some people on Clubhouse told me

20:20.460 --> 20:25.460
 you made a bunch of big debate points about free will.

20:25.940 --> 20:28.860
 Well, let me just then ask you where,

20:28.860 --> 20:31.700
 in terms of the monkey and the elephant,

20:31.700 --> 20:35.300
 do you think we land in terms of the illusion of free will?

20:35.300 --> 20:37.300
 How much control does the monkey have?

20:38.580 --> 20:41.460
 We have to think about what the free will is

20:41.460 --> 20:43.260
 in the first place.

20:43.260 --> 20:44.420
 We are not the machine.

20:44.420 --> 20:46.820
 We are not the thing that is making the decisions.

20:46.820 --> 20:49.900
 We are a model of that decision making process.

20:49.900 --> 20:54.220
 And there is a difference between making your own decisions

20:54.220 --> 20:56.180
 and predicting your own decisions.

20:56.180 --> 20:58.740
 And that difference is the first person perspective.

20:59.860 --> 21:04.820
 And what basically makes decision making

21:04.820 --> 21:06.620
 and the conditions of free will distinct

21:06.620 --> 21:10.340
 from just automatically doing the best thing is

21:10.340 --> 21:13.260
 that we often don't know what the best thing is.

21:13.260 --> 21:15.540
 We make decisions under uncertainty.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.900
 We make informed bets using a betting algorithm

21:17.900 --> 21:19.140
 that we don't yet understand

21:19.140 --> 21:20.900
 because we haven't reverse engineered

21:20.900 --> 21:22.340
 our own minds sufficiently.

21:22.340 --> 21:23.900
 We don't know the expected rewards.

21:23.900 --> 21:24.940
 We don't know the mechanism

21:24.940 --> 21:27.180
 by which we estimate the rewards and so on.

21:27.180 --> 21:28.300
 But there is an algorithm.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.580
 We observe ourselves performing

21:30.580 --> 21:34.820
 where we see that we weight facts and factors

21:34.820 --> 21:39.300
 and the future, and then some kind of possibility,

21:39.300 --> 21:41.620
 some motive gets raised to an intention.

21:41.620 --> 21:44.500
 And that's informed bet that the system is making.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.420
 And that making of the informed bet,

21:46.420 --> 21:49.460
 the representation of that is what we call free will.

21:49.460 --> 21:51.580
 And it seems to be paradoxical

21:51.580 --> 21:53.700
 because we think that the crucial thing is

21:53.700 --> 21:56.500
 about it that it's somehow indeterministic.

21:56.500 --> 21:59.220
 And yet if it was indeterministic, it would be random.

22:00.340 --> 22:03.380
 And it cannot be random because if it was random,

22:03.380 --> 22:05.300
 if just dice were being thrown in the universe,

22:05.300 --> 22:08.180
 randomly forces you to do things, it would be meaningless.

22:08.180 --> 22:10.420
 So the important part of the decisions

22:10.420 --> 22:12.700
 is always the deterministic stuff.

22:12.700 --> 22:15.220
 But it appears to be indeterministic to you

22:15.220 --> 22:16.820
 because it's unpredictable.

22:16.820 --> 22:18.500
 Because if it was predictable,

22:18.500 --> 22:21.460
 you wouldn't experience it as a free will decision.

22:21.460 --> 22:23.260
 You would experience it as just doing

22:23.260 --> 22:25.580
 the necessary right thing.

22:25.580 --> 22:28.740
 And you see this continuum between the free will

22:28.740 --> 22:31.740
 and the execution of automatic behavior

22:31.740 --> 22:33.220
 when you're observing other people.

22:33.220 --> 22:36.220
 So for instance, when you are observing your own children,

22:36.220 --> 22:37.580
 if you don't understand them,

22:37.580 --> 22:40.060
 you will abuse this agent model

22:40.060 --> 22:43.260
 where you have an agent with a set point generator.

22:43.260 --> 22:45.420
 And the agent is doing the best it can

22:45.420 --> 22:47.420
 to minimize the difference to the set point.

22:47.420 --> 22:51.220
 And it might be confused and sometimes impulsive or whatever,

22:51.220 --> 22:53.340
 but it's acting on its own free will.

22:53.340 --> 22:55.420
 And when you understand what's happens

22:55.420 --> 22:58.540
 in the mind of the child, you see that it's automatic.

22:58.540 --> 23:00.300
 And you can outmodel the child,

23:00.300 --> 23:02.300
 you can build things around the child

23:02.300 --> 23:05.260
 that will lead the child to making exactly the decision

23:05.260 --> 23:06.740
 that you are predicting.

23:06.740 --> 23:08.740
 And under these circumstances,

23:08.740 --> 23:10.500
 like when you are a stage musician

23:10.500 --> 23:13.420
 or somebody who is dealing with people

23:13.420 --> 23:15.260
 that you sell a car to,

23:15.260 --> 23:17.300
 and you completely understand the psychology

23:17.300 --> 23:19.660
 and the impulses and the space of thoughts

23:19.660 --> 23:21.580
 that this individual can have at that moment.

23:21.580 --> 23:22.620
 Under these circumstances,

23:22.620 --> 23:24.660
 it makes no sense to attribute free will.

23:26.060 --> 23:28.220
 Because it's no longer decision making under uncertainty.

23:28.220 --> 23:29.220
 You are already certain.

23:29.220 --> 23:30.500
 For them, there's uncertainty,

23:30.500 --> 23:32.460
 but you already know what they're doing.

23:33.780 --> 23:34.980
 But what about for you?

23:34.980 --> 23:39.980
 So is this akin to like systems like cellular automata

23:40.500 --> 23:43.300
 where it's deterministic,

23:43.300 --> 23:46.060
 but when you squint your eyes a little bit,

23:46.940 --> 23:50.780
 it starts to look like there's agents making decisions

23:50.780 --> 23:53.780
 at the higher sort of when you zoom out

23:53.780 --> 23:55.020
 and look at the entities

23:55.020 --> 23:58.460
 that are composed by the individual cells.

23:58.460 --> 24:02.060
 Even though there's underlying simple rules

24:02.060 --> 24:07.060
 that make the system evolve in deterministic ways,

24:07.540 --> 24:10.780
 it looks like there's organisms making decisions.

24:10.780 --> 24:14.500
 Is that where the illusion of free will emerges,

24:14.500 --> 24:15.900
 that jump in scale?

24:16.740 --> 24:18.500
 It's a particular type of model,

24:18.500 --> 24:20.700
 but this jump in scale is crucial.

24:20.700 --> 24:22.380
 The jump in scale happens whenever

24:22.380 --> 24:23.820
 you have too many parts to count

24:23.820 --> 24:25.780
 and you cannot make a model at that level

24:25.780 --> 24:28.780
 and you try to find some higher level regularity.

24:28.780 --> 24:30.900
 And the higher level regularity is a pattern

24:30.900 --> 24:34.660
 that you project into the world to make sense of it.

24:34.660 --> 24:36.460
 And agency is one of these patterns, right?

24:36.460 --> 24:39.700
 You have all these cells that interact with each other

24:39.700 --> 24:42.220
 and the cells in our body are set up in such a way

24:42.220 --> 24:45.060
 that they benefit if their behavior is coherent,

24:45.060 --> 24:46.580
 which means that they act

24:46.580 --> 24:49.180
 as if they were serving a common goal.

24:49.180 --> 24:52.340
 And that means that they will evolve regulation mechanisms

24:52.340 --> 24:55.300
 that act as if they were serving a common goal.

24:55.300 --> 24:57.620
 And now you can make sense of all these cells

24:57.620 --> 24:59.900
 by projecting the common goal into them.

24:59.900 --> 25:03.340
 Right, so for you then, free will is an illusion.

25:03.340 --> 25:06.460
 No, it's a model and it's a construct.

25:06.460 --> 25:08.580
 It's basically a model that the system is making

25:08.580 --> 25:09.420
 of its own behavior.

25:09.420 --> 25:11.500
 And it's the best model that it can come up with

25:11.500 --> 25:12.740
 under the circumstances.

25:12.740 --> 25:14.740
 And it can get replaced by a different model,

25:14.740 --> 25:16.420
 which is automatic behavior,

25:16.420 --> 25:17.980
 when you fully understand the mechanism

25:17.980 --> 25:19.180
 under which you are acting.

25:19.180 --> 25:23.860
 Yeah, but another word for model is what, story.

25:23.860 --> 25:25.300
 So it's the story you're telling.

25:25.300 --> 25:27.340
 I mean, do you actually have control?

25:27.340 --> 25:29.420
 Is there such a thing as a you

25:29.420 --> 25:33.980
 and is there such a thing as you have in control?

25:33.980 --> 25:38.980
 So like, are you manifesting your evolution as an entity?

25:42.020 --> 25:44.380
 In some sense, the you is the model of the system

25:44.380 --> 25:45.660
 that is in control.

25:45.660 --> 25:47.860
 It's a story that the system tells itself

25:47.860 --> 25:50.340
 about somebody who is in control.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.180
 Yeah.

25:51.180 --> 25:53.060
 And the contents of that model are being used

25:53.060 --> 25:54.940
 to inform the behavior of the system.

25:56.940 --> 25:57.780
 Okay.

25:57.780 --> 26:00.500
 So the system is completely mechanical

26:00.500 --> 26:03.300
 and the system creates that story like a loom.

26:03.300 --> 26:06.020
 And then it uses the contents of that story

26:06.020 --> 26:07.460
 to inform its actions

26:07.460 --> 26:11.220
 and writes the results of that actions into the story.

26:11.220 --> 26:13.380
 So how's that not an illusion?

26:13.380 --> 26:16.220
 The story is written then,

26:16.220 --> 26:19.780
 or rather we're not the writers of the story.

26:21.260 --> 26:22.780
 Yes, but we always knew that.

26:24.060 --> 26:25.300
 No, we don't know that.

26:25.300 --> 26:26.740
 When did we know that?

26:26.740 --> 26:29.260
 I think that's mostly a confusion about concepts.

26:29.260 --> 26:31.980
 The conceptual illusion in our culture

26:31.980 --> 26:35.700
 comes from the idea that we live in physical reality

26:35.700 --> 26:37.460
 and that we experience physical reality

26:37.460 --> 26:39.500
 and that you have ideas about it.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.660
 And then you have this dualist interpretation

26:41.660 --> 26:45.060
 where you have two substances, res extensa,

26:45.060 --> 26:46.940
 the world that you can touch

26:46.940 --> 26:48.980
 and that is made of extended things

26:48.980 --> 26:51.620
 and res cogitans, which is the world of ideas.

26:51.620 --> 26:54.580
 And in fact, both of them are mental representations.

26:54.580 --> 26:57.900
 One is the representations of the world as a game engine

26:57.900 --> 27:01.100
 that your mind generates to make sense of the perceptual data.

27:01.100 --> 27:02.260
 And the other one,

27:02.260 --> 27:04.460
 yes, that's what we perceive as the physical world.

27:04.460 --> 27:05.940
 But we already know that the physical world

27:05.940 --> 27:07.020
 is nothing like that, right?

27:07.020 --> 27:08.860
 Quantum mechanics is very different

27:08.860 --> 27:11.340
 from what you and me perceive as the world.

27:11.340 --> 27:14.820
 The world that you and me perceive as a game engine.

27:14.820 --> 27:17.180
 And there are no colors and sounds in the physical world.

27:17.180 --> 27:20.100
 They only exist in the game engine generated by your brain.

27:20.100 --> 27:21.500
 And then you have ideas

27:21.500 --> 27:24.740
 that cannot be mapped onto extended regions, right?

27:24.740 --> 27:26.940
 So the objects that have a spatial extension

27:26.940 --> 27:29.500
 in the game engine, res extensa,

27:29.500 --> 27:31.460
 and the objects that don't have a physical extension

27:31.460 --> 27:34.540
 in the game engine are ideas.

27:34.540 --> 27:36.140
 And they both interact in our mind

27:36.140 --> 27:38.220
 to produce models of the world.

27:38.220 --> 27:41.740
 Yep, but, you know, when you play video games,

27:42.780 --> 27:45.020
 I understand that what's actually happening

27:45.020 --> 27:50.020
 is zeros and ones inside of a computer,

27:50.020 --> 27:52.820
 inside of a CPU and a GPU,

27:52.820 --> 27:57.820
 but you're still seeing like the rendering of that.

27:58.140 --> 28:00.700
 And you're still making decisions,

28:00.700 --> 28:03.740
 whether to shoot, to turn left or to turn right,

28:03.740 --> 28:04.660
 if you're playing a shooter,

28:04.660 --> 28:07.100
 or every time I started thinking about Skyrim

28:07.100 --> 28:09.860
 and Elder Scrolls and walking around in beautiful nature

28:09.860 --> 28:10.900
 and swinging a sword.

28:10.900 --> 28:13.100
 But it feels like you're making decisions

28:13.100 --> 28:15.060
 inside that video game.

28:15.060 --> 28:17.220
 So even though you don't have direct access

28:17.220 --> 28:21.220
 in terms of perception to the bits,

28:21.220 --> 28:22.660
 to the zeros and ones,

28:22.660 --> 28:24.860
 it still feels like you're making decisions

28:24.860 --> 28:27.900
 and your decisions actually feels

28:27.900 --> 28:30.740
 like they're being applied all the way down

28:30.740 --> 28:32.300
 to the zeros and ones.

28:32.300 --> 28:33.460
 So it feels like you have control,

28:33.460 --> 28:36.540
 even though you don't have direct access to reality.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.780
 So there is basically a special character

28:38.780 --> 28:40.420
 in the video game that is being created

28:40.420 --> 28:42.100
 by the video game engine.

28:42.100 --> 28:43.820
 And this character is serving the aesthetics

28:43.820 --> 28:47.060
 of the video game, and that is you.

28:47.060 --> 28:50.900
 Yes, but I feel like I have control inside the video game.

28:50.900 --> 28:53.060
 Like all those like 12 year olds

28:53.060 --> 28:55.420
 that kick my ass on the internet.

28:55.420 --> 28:57.700
 So when you play the video game,

28:57.700 --> 28:59.900
 it doesn't really matter that there's zeros and ones, right?

28:59.900 --> 29:01.700
 You don't care about the bits of the past.

29:01.700 --> 29:03.540
 You don't care about the nature of the CPU

29:03.540 --> 29:04.460
 that it runs on.

29:04.460 --> 29:06.700
 What you care about are the properties of the game

29:06.700 --> 29:07.780
 that you're playing.

29:07.780 --> 29:10.060
 And you hope that the CPU is good enough.

29:10.060 --> 29:10.900
 Yes.

29:10.900 --> 29:13.300
 And a similar thing happens when we interact with physics.

29:13.300 --> 29:15.980
 The world that you and me are in is not the physical world.

29:15.980 --> 29:18.420
 The world that you and me are in is a dream world.

29:19.580 --> 29:21.660
 How close is it to the real world though?

29:23.420 --> 29:25.020
 We know that it's not very close,

29:25.020 --> 29:27.500
 but we know that the dynamics of the dream world

29:27.500 --> 29:29.300
 match the dynamics of the physical world

29:29.300 --> 29:31.060
 to a certain degree of resolution.

29:31.060 --> 29:33.860
 But the causal structure of the dream world is different.

29:35.220 --> 29:38.180
 So you see for instance waves crashing on your feet, right?

29:38.180 --> 29:39.420
 But there are no waves in the ocean.

29:39.420 --> 29:42.420
 There's only water molecules that have tangents

29:42.420 --> 29:47.340
 between the molecules that are the result of electrons

29:47.340 --> 29:50.060
 in the molecules interacting with each other.

29:50.060 --> 29:52.140
 Aren't they like very consistent?

29:52.140 --> 29:55.700
 We're just seeing a very crude approximation.

29:55.700 --> 29:59.340
 Isn't our dream world very consistent,

29:59.340 --> 30:02.980
 like to the point of being mapped directly one to one

30:02.980 --> 30:04.260
 to the actual physical world

30:04.260 --> 30:07.660
 as opposed to us being completely tricked?

30:07.660 --> 30:09.220
 Is this is like where you have like Donald?

30:09.220 --> 30:10.060
 It's not a trick.

30:10.060 --> 30:10.900
 That's my point.

30:10.900 --> 30:11.860
 It's not an illusion.

30:11.860 --> 30:13.700
 It's a form of data compression.

30:13.700 --> 30:15.420
 It's an attempt to deal with the dynamics

30:15.420 --> 30:16.940
 of too many parts to count

30:16.940 --> 30:18.700
 at the level at which we are entangled

30:18.700 --> 30:20.740
 with the best model that you can find.

30:20.740 --> 30:22.700
 Yeah, so we can act in that dream world

30:22.700 --> 30:26.140
 and our actions have impact in the real world,

30:26.140 --> 30:28.620
 in the physical world to which we don't have access.

30:28.620 --> 30:31.860
 Yes, but it's basically like accepting the fact

30:31.860 --> 30:33.180
 that the software that we live in,

30:33.180 --> 30:35.380
 the dream that we live in is generated

30:35.380 --> 30:38.060
 by something outside of this world that you and me are in.

30:38.060 --> 30:40.060
 So is the software deterministic

30:40.060 --> 30:42.260
 and do we not have any control?

30:42.260 --> 30:47.260
 Do we have, so free will is having a conscious being.

30:49.620 --> 30:52.860
 Free will is the monkey being able to steer the elephant.

30:55.300 --> 30:58.060
 No, it's slightly different.

30:58.060 --> 31:00.540
 Basically in the same way as you are modeling

31:00.540 --> 31:03.460
 the water molecules in the ocean that engulf your feet

31:03.460 --> 31:05.980
 when you are walking on the beach as waves

31:05.980 --> 31:07.380
 and there are no waves,

31:07.380 --> 31:09.780
 but only the atoms on more complicated stuff

31:09.780 --> 31:11.820
 underneath the atoms and so on.

31:11.820 --> 31:13.020
 And you know that, right?

31:14.020 --> 31:15.300
 You would accept, yes,

31:15.300 --> 31:17.660
 there is a certain abstraction that happens here.

31:17.660 --> 31:19.420
 It's a simplification of what happens

31:19.420 --> 31:22.100
 and the simplification that is designed

31:22.100 --> 31:24.260
 in such a way that your brain can deal with it,

31:24.260 --> 31:27.020
 temporarily and spatially in terms of resources

31:27.020 --> 31:28.740
 and tuned for the predictive value.

31:28.740 --> 31:31.220
 So you can predict with some accuracy

31:31.220 --> 31:33.380
 whether your feet are going to get wet or not.

31:33.380 --> 31:37.620
 But it's a really good interface and approximation.

31:37.620 --> 31:40.340
 It says E equals MC squared is a good,

31:40.340 --> 31:43.100
 equations are good approximation for,

31:43.100 --> 31:44.780
 they're much better approximation.

31:45.780 --> 31:49.380
 So to me, waves is a really nice approximation

31:49.380 --> 31:51.940
 of what's all the complexity that's happening underneath.

31:51.940 --> 31:53.140
 Basically it's a machine learning model

31:53.140 --> 31:55.580
 that is constantly tuned to minimize surprises.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.540
 So it basically tries to predict as well as it can

31:58.540 --> 31:59.780
 what you're going to perceive next.

31:59.780 --> 32:02.620
 Are we talking about, which is the machine learning?

32:02.620 --> 32:05.700
 Our perception system or the dream world?

32:05.700 --> 32:08.260
 The machine world, dream world is the result

32:08.260 --> 32:11.180
 of the machine learning process of the perceptual system.

32:11.180 --> 32:12.220
 That's doing the compression.

32:12.220 --> 32:13.060
 Yes.

32:13.060 --> 32:15.860
 And the model of you as an agent

32:15.860 --> 32:19.460
 is not a different type of model or it's a different type,

32:19.460 --> 32:23.180
 but not different as in its model like nature

32:23.180 --> 32:25.540
 from the model of the ocean, right?

32:25.540 --> 32:28.260
 Some things are oceans, some things are agents.

32:28.260 --> 32:31.620
 And one of these agents is using your own control model,

32:31.620 --> 32:32.780
 the output of your model,

32:32.780 --> 32:36.260
 the things that you perceive yourself as doing.

32:36.260 --> 32:38.180
 And that is you.

32:38.180 --> 32:42.020
 What about the fact that when you're standing

32:44.100 --> 32:47.340
 with the water on your feet and you're looking out

32:47.340 --> 32:51.980
 into the vast open water of the ocean

32:51.980 --> 32:54.460
 and then there's a beautiful sunset

32:54.460 --> 32:56.540
 and the fact that it's beautiful

32:56.540 --> 32:59.180
 and then maybe you have friends or a loved one with you

32:59.180 --> 33:00.900
 and you feel love, what is that?

33:00.900 --> 33:02.700
 As the dream world or what is that?

33:02.700 --> 33:05.620
 Yes, it's all happening inside of the dream.

33:05.620 --> 33:06.860
 Okay.

33:06.860 --> 33:11.380
 But see, the word dream makes it seem like it's not real.

33:11.380 --> 33:12.780
 No, of course it's not real.

33:14.940 --> 33:16.540
 The physical universe is real,

33:16.540 --> 33:18.620
 but the physical universe is incomprehensible

33:18.620 --> 33:21.060
 and it doesn't have any feeling of realness.

33:21.060 --> 33:22.900
 The feeling of realness that you experience

33:22.900 --> 33:25.420
 gets attached to certain representations

33:25.420 --> 33:26.620
 where your brain assesses,

33:26.620 --> 33:28.500
 this is the best model of reality that I have.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.820
 So the only thing that's real to you

33:30.820 --> 33:34.740
 is the thing that's happening at the very base of reality.

33:34.740 --> 33:39.020
 Yeah, for something to be real, it needs to be implemented.

33:40.020 --> 33:42.340
 So the model that you have of reality

33:42.340 --> 33:45.300
 is real in as far as it is a model.

33:45.300 --> 33:47.860
 It's an appropriate description of the world

33:47.860 --> 33:51.500
 to say that there are models that are being experienced,

33:51.500 --> 33:54.700
 but the world that you experience

33:54.700 --> 33:56.900
 is not necessarily implemented.

33:56.900 --> 33:59.380
 There is a difference between a reality,

33:59.380 --> 34:01.260
 a simulation and a simulacrum.

34:02.220 --> 34:04.460
 The reality that we're talking about

34:04.460 --> 34:06.060
 is something that fully emerges

34:06.060 --> 34:08.620
 over a causally closed lowest layer.

34:08.620 --> 34:11.300
 And the idea of physicalism is that we are in that layer,

34:11.300 --> 34:13.460
 that basically our world emerges over that.

34:13.460 --> 34:16.060
 Every alternative to physicalism is a simulation theory,

34:16.060 --> 34:17.980
 which basically says that we are

34:17.980 --> 34:19.460
 in some kind of simulation universe

34:19.460 --> 34:22.100
 and the real world needs to be in a parent universe of that,

34:22.100 --> 34:24.380
 where the actual causal structure is, right?

34:24.380 --> 34:27.660
 And when you look at the ocean and your own mind,

34:27.660 --> 34:28.900
 you are looking at a simulation

34:28.900 --> 34:31.460
 that explains what you're going to see next.

34:31.460 --> 34:32.860
 So we are living in a simulation.

34:32.860 --> 34:35.900
 Yes, but a simulation generated by our own brains.

34:35.900 --> 34:36.740
 Yeah.

34:36.740 --> 34:39.660
 And this simulation is different from the physical reality

34:39.660 --> 34:42.060
 because the causal structure that is being produced,

34:42.060 --> 34:43.380
 what you are seeing is different

34:43.380 --> 34:44.980
 from the causal structure of physics.

34:44.980 --> 34:45.900
 But consistent.

34:46.780 --> 34:49.780
 Hopefully, if not, then you are going to end up

34:49.780 --> 34:51.060
 in some kind of institution

34:51.060 --> 34:52.220
 where people will take care of you

34:52.220 --> 34:54.580
 because your behavior will be inconsistent, right?

34:54.580 --> 34:57.220
 Your behavior needs to work in such a way

34:57.220 --> 35:00.140
 that it's interacting with an accurately predictive

35:00.140 --> 35:00.980
 model of reality.

35:00.980 --> 35:03.500
 And if your brain is unable to make your model

35:03.500 --> 35:06.180
 of reality predictive, you will need help.

35:06.180 --> 35:10.260
 So what do you think about Donald Hoffman's argument

35:10.260 --> 35:12.740
 that it doesn't have to be consistent,

35:12.740 --> 35:16.820
 the dream world to what he calls like the interface

35:17.820 --> 35:19.500
 to the actual physical reality,

35:19.500 --> 35:20.660
 where there could be evolution?

35:20.660 --> 35:23.060
 I think he makes an evolutionary argument,

35:23.060 --> 35:26.460
 which is like, it could be an evolutionary advantage

35:26.460 --> 35:30.940
 to have the dream world drift away from physical reality.

35:30.940 --> 35:32.780
 I think that only works if you have tenure.

35:32.780 --> 35:35.260
 As long as you're still interacting with the ground tools,

35:35.260 --> 35:37.580
 your model needs to be somewhat predictive.

35:38.980 --> 35:42.740
 Well, in some sense, humans have achieved a kind of tenure

35:42.740 --> 35:43.900
 in the animal kingdom.

35:45.100 --> 35:45.940
 Yeah.

35:45.940 --> 35:47.620
 And at some point we became too big to fail,

35:47.620 --> 35:49.300
 so we became postmodernist.

35:51.420 --> 35:52.660
 It all makes sense now.

35:52.660 --> 35:54.980
 We can just change the version of reality that we like.

35:54.980 --> 35:56.500
 Oh man.

35:56.500 --> 35:57.380
 Okay.

35:57.380 --> 36:00.220
 Yeah, but basically you can do magic.

36:00.220 --> 36:02.460
 You can change your assessment of reality,

36:02.460 --> 36:05.580
 but eventually reality is going to come bite you in the ass

36:05.580 --> 36:06.820
 if it's not predictive.

36:06.820 --> 36:11.220
 Do you have a sense of what is that base layer

36:11.220 --> 36:12.580
 of physical reality?

36:12.580 --> 36:15.540
 You have like, so you have these attempts

36:15.540 --> 36:17.620
 at the theories of everything,

36:17.620 --> 36:21.140
 the very, very small of like strength theory,

36:21.140 --> 36:25.420
 or what Stephen Wolfram talks about with the hyper grass.

36:25.420 --> 36:28.540
 These are these tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny objects.

36:28.540 --> 36:31.660
 And then there is more like quantum mechanics

36:32.620 --> 36:34.900
 that's talking about objects that are much larger,

36:34.900 --> 36:36.780
 but still very, very, very tiny.

36:36.780 --> 36:40.060
 Do you have a sense of where the tiniest thing is

36:40.060 --> 36:42.900
 that is like at the lowest level?

36:42.900 --> 36:44.740
 The turtle at the very bottom.

36:44.740 --> 36:45.980
 Do you have a sense what that turtle is?

36:45.980 --> 36:48.580
 I don't think that you can talk about where it is

36:48.580 --> 36:51.580
 because space is emerging over the activity of these things.

36:51.580 --> 36:55.540
 So space, the coordinates only exist

36:55.540 --> 36:58.820
 in relation to the things, other things.

36:58.820 --> 37:01.740
 And so you could, in some sense, abstract it into locations

37:01.740 --> 37:04.300
 that can hold information and trajectories

37:04.300 --> 37:05.540
 that the information can take

37:05.540 --> 37:06.860
 between the different locations.

37:06.860 --> 37:10.380
 And this is how we construct our notion of space.

37:10.380 --> 37:14.100
 And physicists usually have a notion of space

37:14.100 --> 37:15.700
 that is continuous.

37:15.700 --> 37:19.140
 And this is a point where I tend to agree

37:19.140 --> 37:20.980
 with people like Stephen Wolfram

37:20.980 --> 37:23.820
 who are very skeptical of the geometric notions.

37:23.820 --> 37:25.980
 I think that geometry is the dynamics

37:25.980 --> 37:27.300
 of too many parts to count.

37:27.300 --> 37:30.820
 And when there are no infinities,

37:30.820 --> 37:32.500
 if there were two infinities,

37:32.500 --> 37:34.220
 you would be running into contradictions,

37:34.220 --> 37:37.780
 which is in some sense what Gödel and Turing discovered

37:37.780 --> 37:39.820
 in response to Hilbert's call.

37:39.820 --> 37:41.340
 So there are no infinities.

37:41.340 --> 37:42.180
 There are no infinities.

37:42.180 --> 37:43.020
 Infinities fake.

37:43.020 --> 37:45.300
 There is unboundedness, but if you have a language

37:45.300 --> 37:47.340
 that talks about infinity, at some point,

37:47.340 --> 37:49.580
 the language is going to contradict itself,

37:49.580 --> 37:51.660
 which means it's no longer valid.

37:51.660 --> 37:54.020
 In order to deal with infinities and mathematics,

37:54.020 --> 37:57.580
 you have to postulate the existence initially.

37:57.580 --> 37:59.180
 You cannot construct the infinities.

37:59.180 --> 38:00.180
 And that's an issue, right?

38:00.180 --> 38:02.700
 You cannot build up an infinity from zero.

38:02.700 --> 38:04.700
 But in practice, you never do this, right?

38:04.700 --> 38:06.020
 When you perform calculations,

38:06.020 --> 38:09.060
 you only look at the dynamics of too many parts to count.

38:09.060 --> 38:13.420
 And usually these numbers are not that large.

38:13.420 --> 38:14.860
 They're not Googles or something.

38:14.860 --> 38:18.540
 The infinities that we are dealing with in our universe

38:18.540 --> 38:22.340
 are mathematically speaking, relatively small integers.

38:23.180 --> 38:26.540
 And still what we're looking at is dynamics

38:26.540 --> 38:30.660
 where a trillion things behave similar

38:30.660 --> 38:32.660
 to a hundred trillion things

38:32.660 --> 38:37.660
 or something that is very, very large

38:37.860 --> 38:39.260
 because they're converging.

38:39.260 --> 38:41.380
 And these convergent dynamics, these operators,

38:41.380 --> 38:45.020
 this is what we deal with when we are doing the geometry.

38:45.020 --> 38:48.420
 Geometry is stuff where we can pretend that it's continuous

38:48.420 --> 38:53.100
 because if we subdivide the space sufficiently fine grained,

38:54.100 --> 38:56.140
 these things approach a certain dynamic.

38:56.140 --> 38:59.220
 And this approach dynamic, that is what we mean by it.

38:59.220 --> 39:02.860
 But I don't think that infinity would work, so to speak,

39:02.860 --> 39:05.060
 that you would know the last digit of pi

39:05.060 --> 39:06.540
 and that you have a physical process

39:06.540 --> 39:09.420
 that rests on knowing the last digit of pi.

39:09.420 --> 39:12.020
 Yeah, that could be just a peculiar quirk

39:12.020 --> 39:15.100
 of human cognition that we like discrete.

39:15.100 --> 39:16.660
 Discrete makes sense to us.

39:16.660 --> 39:19.900
 Infinity doesn't, so in terms of our intuitions.

39:19.900 --> 39:22.940
 No, the issue is that everything that we think about

39:22.940 --> 39:25.660
 needs to be expressed in some kind of mental language,

39:25.660 --> 39:27.740
 not necessarily natural language,

39:27.740 --> 39:29.860
 but some kind of mathematical language

39:29.860 --> 39:31.700
 that your neurons can speak

39:31.700 --> 39:34.140
 that refers to something in the world.

39:34.140 --> 39:35.460
 And what we have discovered

39:35.460 --> 39:39.020
 is that we cannot construct a notion of infinity

39:39.020 --> 39:40.540
 without running into contradictions,

39:40.540 --> 39:43.620
 which means that such a language is no longer valid.

39:43.620 --> 39:46.780
 And I suspect this is what made Pythagoras so unhappy

39:46.780 --> 39:49.380
 when somebody came up with the notion of irrational numbers

39:49.380 --> 39:50.420
 before it was time, right?

39:50.420 --> 39:52.700
 There's this myth that he had this person killed

39:52.700 --> 39:54.140
 when he blabbed out the secret

39:54.140 --> 39:55.740
 that not everything can be expressed

39:55.740 --> 39:57.300
 as a ratio between two numbers,

39:57.300 --> 39:59.740
 but there are numbers between the ratios.

39:59.740 --> 40:01.060
 The world was not ready for this.

40:01.060 --> 40:02.380
 And I think he was right.

40:02.380 --> 40:06.060
 That has confused mathematicians very seriously

40:06.060 --> 40:09.660
 because these numbers are not values, they are functions.

40:09.660 --> 40:11.580
 And so you can calculate these functions

40:11.580 --> 40:13.260
 to a certain degree of approximation,

40:13.260 --> 40:17.060
 but you cannot pretend that pi has actually a value.

40:17.060 --> 40:20.020
 Pi is a function that would approach this value

40:20.020 --> 40:21.500
 to some degree,

40:21.500 --> 40:23.780
 but nothing in the world rests on knowing pi.

40:26.980 --> 40:28.620
 How important is this distinction

40:28.620 --> 40:32.180
 between discrete and continuous for you to get to the book?

40:32.180 --> 40:36.580
 Because there's a, I mean, in discussion of your favorite

40:36.580 --> 40:39.180
 flavor of the theory of everything,

40:39.180 --> 40:41.140
 there's a few on the table.

40:41.140 --> 40:44.420
 So there's string theory, there's a particular,

40:45.260 --> 40:48.180
 there's a little quantum gravity,

40:48.180 --> 40:51.660
 which focused on one particular unification.

40:53.180 --> 40:56.140
 There's just a bunch of favorite flavors

40:56.140 --> 40:59.460
 of different people trying to propose

40:59.460 --> 41:01.260
 a theory of everything.

41:01.260 --> 41:04.780
 Eric Weinstein and a bunch of people throughout history.

41:04.780 --> 41:06.660
 And then of course, Stephen Wolfram,

41:06.660 --> 41:10.860
 who I think is one of the only people doing a discrete.

41:10.860 --> 41:12.580
 No, no, there's a bunch of physicists

41:12.580 --> 41:13.700
 who do this right now.

41:13.700 --> 41:17.660
 And like Toffoli and Tomasello.

41:17.660 --> 41:21.940
 And digital physics is something

41:21.940 --> 41:24.460
 that is, I think, growing in popularity.

41:24.460 --> 41:29.460
 But the main reason why this is interesting

41:29.460 --> 41:34.460
 is because it's important sometimes to settle disagreements.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.980
 I don't think that you need infinities at all,

41:36.980 --> 41:38.940
 and you never needed them.

41:38.940 --> 41:40.900
 You can always deal with very large numbers

41:40.900 --> 41:42.260
 and you can deal with limits, right?

41:42.260 --> 41:43.780
 We are fine with doing that.

41:43.780 --> 41:45.300
 You don't need any kind of infinity.

41:45.300 --> 41:48.340
 You can build your computer algebra systems just as well

41:48.340 --> 41:50.300
 without believing in infinity in the first place.

41:50.300 --> 41:51.940
 So you're okay with limits?

41:51.940 --> 41:54.420
 Yeah, so basically a limit means that something

41:54.420 --> 41:57.460
 is behaving pretty much the same

41:57.460 --> 41:59.100
 if you make the number large.

41:59.100 --> 42:02.420
 Right, because it's converging to a certain value.

42:02.420 --> 42:04.780
 And at some point the difference becomes negligible

42:04.780 --> 42:06.620
 and you can no longer measure it.

42:06.620 --> 42:08.660
 And in this sense, you have things

42:08.660 --> 42:12.820
 that if you have an ngon which has enough corners,

42:12.820 --> 42:15.180
 then it's going to behave like a circle at some point, right?

42:15.180 --> 42:18.380
 And it's only going to be in some kind of esoteric thing

42:18.380 --> 42:21.060
 that cannot exist in the physical universe

42:21.060 --> 42:23.820
 that you would be talking about this perfect circle.

42:23.820 --> 42:25.900
 And now it turns out that it also wouldn't work

42:25.900 --> 42:28.380
 in mathematics because you cannot construct mathematics

42:28.380 --> 42:30.020
 that has infinite resolution

42:30.020 --> 42:31.820
 without running into contradictions.

42:32.820 --> 42:35.020
 So that is itself not that important

42:35.020 --> 42:36.220
 because we never did that, right?

42:36.220 --> 42:39.020
 It's just a thing that some people thought we could.

42:39.020 --> 42:40.780
 And this leads to confusion.

42:40.780 --> 42:43.580
 So for instance, Roger Penrose uses this as an argument

42:43.580 --> 42:46.140
 to say that there are certain things

42:46.140 --> 42:50.580
 that mathematicians can do dealing with infinities

42:50.580 --> 42:53.220
 and by extension our mind can do

42:53.220 --> 42:55.180
 that computers cannot do.

42:55.180 --> 42:58.420
 Yeah, he talks about that the human mind

42:58.420 --> 43:00.780
 can do certain mathematical things

43:00.780 --> 43:02.900
 that the computer as defined

43:02.900 --> 43:06.140
 by the universal Turing machine cannot.

43:06.140 --> 43:07.180
 Yes.

43:07.180 --> 43:08.900
 So that it has to do with infinity.

43:08.900 --> 43:10.260
 Yes, it's one of the things.

43:10.260 --> 43:13.100
 So he is basically pointing at the fact

43:13.100 --> 43:15.580
 that there are things that are possible

43:15.580 --> 43:20.580
 in the mathematical mind and in pure mathematics

43:21.420 --> 43:24.100
 that are not possible in machines

43:24.100 --> 43:27.060
 that can be constructed in the physical universe.

43:27.060 --> 43:29.140
 And because he's an honest guy,

43:29.140 --> 43:31.660
 he thinks this means that present physics

43:31.660 --> 43:34.860
 cannot explain operations that happen in our mind.

43:34.860 --> 43:35.780
 Do you think he's right?

43:35.780 --> 43:38.700
 And so let's leave his discussion

43:38.700 --> 43:40.780
 of consciousness aside for the moment.

43:40.780 --> 43:42.780
 Do you think he's right about just

43:42.780 --> 43:46.060
 what he's basically referring to as intelligence?

43:46.060 --> 43:50.780
 So is the human mind fundamentally more capable

43:50.780 --> 43:53.940
 as a thinking machine than a universal Turing machine?

43:53.940 --> 43:55.460
 No.

43:55.460 --> 43:58.740
 But so he's suggesting that, right?

43:58.740 --> 44:01.020
 So our mind is actually less than a Turing machine.

44:01.020 --> 44:02.100
 There can be no Turing machine

44:02.100 --> 44:05.100
 because it's defined as having an infinite tape.

44:05.100 --> 44:07.260
 And we always only have a finite tape.

44:07.260 --> 44:08.100
 But he's saying it's better.

44:08.100 --> 44:10.140
 Our minds can only perform finitely many operations.

44:10.140 --> 44:10.980
 Yes, he thinks so.

44:10.980 --> 44:13.100
 He's saying it can do the kind of computation

44:13.100 --> 44:14.620
 that the Turing machine cannot.

44:14.620 --> 44:16.660
 And that's because he thinks that our minds

44:16.660 --> 44:19.500
 can do operations that have infinite resolution

44:19.500 --> 44:21.020
 in some sense.

44:21.020 --> 44:23.260
 And I don't think that's the case.

44:23.260 --> 44:26.340
 Our minds are just able to discover these limit operators

44:26.340 --> 44:27.700
 over too many parts to count.

44:27.700 --> 44:28.540
 I see.

44:30.300 --> 44:32.740
 What about his idea that consciousness

44:32.740 --> 44:37.460
 is more than a computation?

44:37.460 --> 44:42.100
 So it's more than something that a Turing machine can do.

44:42.100 --> 44:44.540
 So again, saying that there's something special

44:44.540 --> 44:47.780
 about our mind that cannot be replicated in a machine.

44:49.820 --> 44:51.380
 The issue is that I don't even know

44:51.380 --> 44:54.300
 how to construct a language to express

44:54.300 --> 44:56.420
 this statement correctly.

44:56.420 --> 44:57.260
 Well,

45:01.100 --> 45:06.100
 the basic statement is there's a human experience

45:06.900 --> 45:09.420
 that includes intelligence, that includes self awareness,

45:09.420 --> 45:12.980
 that includes the hard problem of consciousness.

45:12.980 --> 45:16.860
 And the question is, can that be fully simulated

45:16.860 --> 45:20.940
 in the computer, in the mathematical model of the computer

45:20.940 --> 45:22.300
 as we understand it today?

45:23.620 --> 45:25.900
 Roger Penrose says no.

45:25.900 --> 45:30.220
 So the universe of Turing machine

45:30.220 --> 45:32.460
 cannot simulate the universe.

45:32.460 --> 45:34.420
 So the interesting question is,

45:34.420 --> 45:36.500
 and you have to ask him this is, why not?

45:36.500 --> 45:39.900
 What is this specific thing that cannot be modeled?

45:39.900 --> 45:42.340
 And when I looked at his writings

45:42.340 --> 45:43.540
 and I haven't read all of it,

45:43.540 --> 45:45.940
 but when I read, for instance,

45:45.940 --> 45:49.060
 the section that he writes in the introduction

45:49.060 --> 45:51.020
 to a road to infinity,

45:51.020 --> 45:53.260
 the thing that he specifically refers to

45:53.260 --> 45:56.620
 is the way in which human minds deal with infinities.

45:57.660 --> 46:02.020
 And that itself can, I think, easily be deconstructed.

46:03.060 --> 46:05.580
 A lot of people feel that our experience

46:05.580 --> 46:07.700
 cannot be explained in a mechanical way.

46:08.660 --> 46:11.060
 And therefore it needs to be different.

46:11.060 --> 46:14.500
 And I concur, our experience is not mechanical.

46:14.500 --> 46:16.700
 Our experience is simulated.

46:16.700 --> 46:18.420
 It exists only in a simulation.

46:18.420 --> 46:19.980
 The only simulation can be conscious.

46:19.980 --> 46:21.580
 Physical systems cannot be conscious

46:21.580 --> 46:23.020
 because they're only mechanical.

46:23.020 --> 46:25.100
 Cells cannot be conscious.

46:25.100 --> 46:26.300
 Neurons cannot be conscious.

46:26.300 --> 46:27.460
 Brains cannot be conscious.

46:27.460 --> 46:28.660
 People cannot be conscious

46:28.660 --> 46:31.620
 as far as if you understand them as physical systems.

46:31.620 --> 46:36.220
 What can be conscious is the story of the system

46:36.220 --> 46:37.980
 in the world where you write all these things

46:37.980 --> 46:39.420
 into the story.

46:39.420 --> 46:41.420
 You have experiences for the same reason

46:41.420 --> 46:43.260
 that a character novel has experiences

46:43.260 --> 46:45.780
 because it's written into the story.

46:45.780 --> 46:48.220
 And now the system is acting on that story.

46:48.220 --> 46:50.660
 And it's not a story that is written in a natural language.

46:50.660 --> 46:52.500
 It's written in a perceptual language,

46:52.500 --> 46:55.380
 in this multimedia language of the game engine.

46:55.380 --> 46:59.340
 And in there, you write in what kind of experience you have

46:59.340 --> 47:01.460
 and what this means for the behavior of the system,

47:01.460 --> 47:03.700
 for your behavior tendencies, for your focus,

47:03.700 --> 47:05.460
 for your attention, for your experience of valence

47:05.460 --> 47:06.420
 and so on.

47:06.420 --> 47:09.620
 And this is being used to inform the behavior of the system

47:09.620 --> 47:10.740
 in the next step.

47:10.740 --> 47:15.740
 And then the story updates with the reactions of the system

47:15.780 --> 47:17.780
 and the changes in the world and so on.

47:17.780 --> 47:19.340
 And you live inside of that model.

47:19.340 --> 47:21.700
 You don't live inside of the physical reality.

47:23.420 --> 47:28.420
 And I mean, just to linger on it, like you say, okay,

47:28.820 --> 47:30.860
 it's in the perceptual language,

47:30.860 --> 47:33.300
 the multimodal perceptual language.

47:33.300 --> 47:34.900
 That's the experience.

47:34.900 --> 47:38.900
 That's what consciousness is within that model,

47:38.900 --> 47:40.860
 within that story.

47:40.860 --> 47:42.660
 But do you have agency?

47:43.980 --> 47:46.020
 When you play a video game, you can turn left

47:46.020 --> 47:48.540
 and you can turn right in that story.

47:49.620 --> 47:54.220
 So in that dream world, how much control do you have?

47:54.220 --> 47:56.460
 Is there such a thing as you in that story?

47:57.620 --> 48:00.980
 Like, is it right to say the main character,

48:00.980 --> 48:02.540
 you know, everybody's NPCs,

48:02.540 --> 48:04.380
 and then there's the main character

48:04.380 --> 48:07.020
 and you're controlling the main character?

48:07.020 --> 48:08.700
 Or is that an illusion?

48:08.700 --> 48:10.900
 Is there a main character that you're controlling?

48:10.900 --> 48:14.540
 I'm getting to the point of like the free will point.

48:14.540 --> 48:17.780
 Imagine that you are building a robot that plays soccer.

48:17.780 --> 48:19.900
 And you've been to MIT computer science,

48:19.900 --> 48:22.060
 you basically know how to do that, right?

48:22.060 --> 48:25.300
 And so you would say the robot is an agent

48:25.300 --> 48:26.820
 that solves a control problem,

48:27.780 --> 48:29.300
 how to get the ball into the goal.

48:29.300 --> 48:30.740
 And it needs to perceive the world

48:30.740 --> 48:33.260
 and the world is disturbing him in trying to do this, right?

48:33.260 --> 48:35.660
 So he has to control many variables to make that happen

48:35.660 --> 48:38.820
 and to project itself and the ball into the future

48:38.820 --> 48:40.700
 and understand its position on the field

48:40.700 --> 48:42.140
 relative to the ball and so on,

48:42.140 --> 48:44.620
 and the position of its limbs

48:44.620 --> 48:46.940
 or in the space around it and so on.

48:46.940 --> 48:48.460
 So it needs to have an adequate model

48:48.460 --> 48:51.380
 that abstracting reality in a useful way.

48:51.380 --> 48:55.900
 And you could say that this robot does have agency

48:55.900 --> 48:58.420
 over what it's doing in some sense.

48:58.420 --> 49:01.500
 And the model is going to be a control model.

49:01.500 --> 49:03.060
 And inside of that control model,

49:03.060 --> 49:05.780
 you can possibly get to a point

49:05.780 --> 49:07.820
 where this thing is sufficiently abstract

49:07.820 --> 49:09.540
 to discover its own agency.

49:09.540 --> 49:10.860
 Our current robots don't do that.

49:10.860 --> 49:13.140
 They don't have a unified model of the universe,

49:13.140 --> 49:16.140
 but there's not a reason why we shouldn't be getting there

49:16.140 --> 49:18.660
 at some point in the not too distant future.

49:18.660 --> 49:20.060
 And once that happens,

49:20.060 --> 49:23.220
 you will notice that the robot tells a story

49:23.220 --> 49:25.980
 about a robot playing soccer.

49:25.980 --> 49:29.420
 So the robot will experience itself playing soccer

49:29.420 --> 49:32.060
 in a simulation of the world that it uses

49:32.060 --> 49:35.340
 to construct a model of the locations of its legs

49:35.340 --> 49:38.180
 and limbs in space on the field

49:38.180 --> 49:39.380
 with relationship to the ball.

49:39.380 --> 49:42.220
 And it's not going to be at the level of the molecules.

49:42.220 --> 49:45.300
 It will be an abstraction that is exactly at the level

49:45.300 --> 49:47.420
 that is most suitable for past planning

49:47.420 --> 49:48.900
 of the movements of the robot.

49:49.940 --> 49:51.420
 It's going to be a high level abstraction,

49:51.420 --> 49:53.700
 but a very useful one that is as predictive

49:53.700 --> 49:55.180
 as we can make it.

49:55.180 --> 49:56.580
 And in that side of that story,

49:56.580 --> 49:58.780
 there is a model of the agency of that system.

49:58.780 --> 50:03.060
 So this model can accurately predict

50:03.060 --> 50:04.740
 that the contents of the model

50:04.740 --> 50:07.380
 are going to be driving the behavior of the robot

50:07.380 --> 50:08.900
 in the immediate future.

50:08.900 --> 50:12.340
 But there's the hard problem of consciousness,

50:12.340 --> 50:14.580
 which I would also,

50:14.580 --> 50:18.060
 there's a subjective experience of free will as well

50:18.060 --> 50:20.740
 that I'm not sure where the robot gets that,

50:20.740 --> 50:22.660
 where that little leap is.

50:22.660 --> 50:24.260
 Because for me right now,

50:24.260 --> 50:26.260
 everything I imagine with that robot,

50:26.260 --> 50:29.020
 as it gets more and more and more sophisticated,

50:29.020 --> 50:33.540
 the agency comes from the programmer of the robot still,

50:33.540 --> 50:35.820
 of what was programmed in.

50:35.820 --> 50:38.500
 You could probably do an end to end learning system.

50:38.500 --> 50:40.300
 You maybe need to give it a few priors.

50:40.300 --> 50:42.460
 So you nudge the architecture in the right direction

50:42.460 --> 50:44.340
 that it converges more quickly,

50:44.340 --> 50:47.980
 but ultimately discovering the suitable hyperparameters

50:47.980 --> 50:50.340
 of the architecture is also only a search process.

50:50.340 --> 50:52.740
 And as the search process was evolution,

50:52.740 --> 50:55.300
 that has informed our brain architecture

50:55.300 --> 50:57.380
 so we can converge in a single lifetime

50:57.380 --> 50:59.500
 on useful interaction with the world

50:59.500 --> 51:00.340
 and the formation of a self model.

51:00.340 --> 51:03.500
 The problem is if we define hyperparameters broadly,

51:03.500 --> 51:06.820
 so it's not just the parameters that control

51:06.820 --> 51:08.700
 this end to end learning system,

51:08.700 --> 51:11.180
 but the entirety of the design of the robot.

51:11.180 --> 51:15.060
 Like there's, you have to remove the human completely

51:15.060 --> 51:15.900
 from the picture.

51:15.900 --> 51:17.300
 And then in order to build the robot,

51:17.300 --> 51:20.340
 you have to create an entire universe.

51:20.340 --> 51:22.620
 Cause you have to go, you can't just shortcut evolution.

51:22.620 --> 51:24.620
 You have to go from the very beginning

51:24.620 --> 51:25.860
 in order for it to have,

51:25.860 --> 51:28.020
 cause I feel like there's always a human

51:28.020 --> 51:32.620
 pulling the strings and that makes it seem like

51:32.620 --> 51:33.900
 the robot is cheating.

51:33.900 --> 51:35.940
 It's getting a shortcut to consciousness.

51:35.940 --> 51:38.300
 And you are looking at the current Boston Dynamics robots.

51:38.300 --> 51:40.140
 It doesn't look as if there is somebody

51:40.140 --> 51:40.980
 pulling the strings.

51:40.980 --> 51:42.420
 It doesn't look like cheating anymore.

51:42.420 --> 51:43.420
 Okay, so let's go there.

51:43.420 --> 51:44.860
 Cause I got to talk to you about this.

51:44.860 --> 51:47.740
 So obviously with the case of Boston Dynamics,

51:47.740 --> 51:49.780
 as you may or may not know,

51:49.780 --> 51:54.100
 it's always either hard coded or remote controlled.

51:54.100 --> 51:55.220
 There's no intelligence.

51:55.220 --> 51:57.460
 I don't know how the current generation

51:57.460 --> 51:59.060
 of Boston Dynamics robots works,

51:59.060 --> 52:02.020
 but what I've been told about the previous ones

52:02.020 --> 52:05.260
 was that it's basically all cybernetic control,

52:05.260 --> 52:08.620
 which means you still have feedback mechanisms and so on,

52:08.620 --> 52:11.340
 but it's not deep learning for the most part

52:11.340 --> 52:13.220
 as it's currently done.

52:13.220 --> 52:14.700
 It's for the most part,

52:14.700 --> 52:16.940
 just identifying a control hierarchy

52:16.940 --> 52:19.820
 that is congruent to the limbs that exist

52:19.820 --> 52:21.460
 and the parameters that need to be optimized

52:21.460 --> 52:22.580
 for the movement of these limbs.

52:22.580 --> 52:24.500
 And then there is a convergence progress.

52:24.500 --> 52:26.220
 So it's basically just regression

52:26.220 --> 52:27.900
 that you would need to control this.

52:27.900 --> 52:29.420
 But again, I don't know whether that's true.

52:29.420 --> 52:31.420
 That's just what I've been told about how they work.

52:31.420 --> 52:35.020
 We have to separate several levels of discussion here.

52:35.020 --> 52:39.300
 So the only thing they do is pretty sophisticated control

52:39.300 --> 52:40.900
 with no machine learning

52:40.900 --> 52:45.900
 in order to maintain balance or to right itself.

52:45.980 --> 52:49.380
 It's a control problem in terms of using the actuators

52:49.380 --> 52:52.420
 to when it's pushed or when it steps on a thing

52:52.420 --> 52:55.420
 that's uneven, how to always maintain balance.

52:55.420 --> 52:57.940
 And there's a tricky set of heuristics around that,

52:57.940 --> 53:00.460
 but that's the only goal.

53:00.460 --> 53:02.660
 Everything you see Boston Dynamics doing

53:02.660 --> 53:06.140
 in terms of that to us humans is compelling,

53:06.140 --> 53:09.460
 which is any kind of higher order movement,

53:09.460 --> 53:12.260
 like turning, wiggling its butt,

53:13.220 --> 53:18.220
 like jumping back on its two feet, dancing.

53:18.740 --> 53:22.460
 Dancing is even worse because dancing is hard coded in.

53:22.460 --> 53:25.300
 It's choreographed by humans.

53:25.300 --> 53:27.420
 There's choreography software.

53:27.420 --> 53:30.900
 So there is no, of all that high level movement,

53:30.900 --> 53:34.220
 there's no anything that you can call,

53:34.220 --> 53:35.940
 certainly can't call AI,

53:35.940 --> 53:39.500
 but there's no even like basic heuristics.

53:39.500 --> 53:41.060
 It's all hard coded in.

53:41.060 --> 53:46.060
 And yet we humans immediately project agency onto them,

53:47.660 --> 53:48.900
 which is fascinating.

53:48.900 --> 53:53.140
 So the gap here doesn't necessarily have agency.

53:53.140 --> 53:55.340
 What it has is cybernetic control.

53:55.340 --> 53:57.420
 And the cybernetic control means you have a hierarchy

53:57.420 --> 53:59.740
 of feedback loops that keep the behavior

53:59.740 --> 54:02.340
 in certain boundaries so the robot doesn't fall over

54:02.340 --> 54:04.140
 and it's able to perform the movements.

54:04.140 --> 54:06.660
 And the choreography cannot really happen

54:06.660 --> 54:09.220
 with motion capture because the robot would fall over

54:09.220 --> 54:10.620
 because the physics of the robot,

54:10.620 --> 54:12.780
 the weight distribution and so on is different

54:12.780 --> 54:15.340
 from the weight distribution in the human body.

54:15.340 --> 54:19.580
 So if you were using the directly motion captured movements

54:19.580 --> 54:21.740
 of a human body to project it into this robot,

54:21.740 --> 54:22.580
 it wouldn't work.

54:22.580 --> 54:24.100
 You can do this with a computer animation.

54:24.100 --> 54:26.140
 It will look a little bit off, but who cares?

54:26.140 --> 54:29.100
 But if you want to correct for the physics,

54:29.100 --> 54:31.500
 you need to basically tell the robot

54:31.500 --> 54:33.740
 where it should move its limbs.

54:33.740 --> 54:35.860
 And then the control algorithm is going

54:35.860 --> 54:38.980
 to approximate a solution that makes it possible

54:38.980 --> 54:41.020
 within the physics of the robot.

54:41.020 --> 54:43.900
 And you have to find the basic solution

54:43.900 --> 54:44.780
 for making that happen.

54:44.780 --> 54:47.580
 And there's probably going to be some regression necessary

54:47.580 --> 54:51.220
 to get the control architecture to make these movements.

54:51.220 --> 54:52.660
 But those two layers are separate.

54:52.660 --> 54:56.180
 So the thing, the higher level instruction

54:56.180 --> 54:59.060
 of how you should move and where you should move

54:59.060 --> 54:59.900
 is a higher level.

54:59.900 --> 55:01.700
 Yeah, so I expect that the control level

55:01.700 --> 55:03.620
 of these robots at some level is dumb.

55:03.620 --> 55:06.180
 This is just the physical control movement,

55:06.180 --> 55:07.860
 the motor architecture.

55:07.860 --> 55:10.340
 But it's a relatively smart motor architecture.

55:10.340 --> 55:12.500
 It's just that there is no high level deliberation

55:12.500 --> 55:14.620
 about what decisions to make necessarily, right?

55:14.620 --> 55:17.900
 But see, it doesn't feel like free will or consciousness.

55:17.900 --> 55:20.580
 No, no, that was not where I was trying to get to.

55:20.580 --> 55:24.540
 I think that in our own body, we have that too.

55:24.540 --> 55:26.900
 So we have a certain thing that is basically

55:26.900 --> 55:29.540
 just a cybernetic control architecture

55:29.540 --> 55:31.300
 that is moving our limbs.

55:31.300 --> 55:34.300
 And deep learning can help in discovering

55:34.300 --> 55:35.940
 such an architecture if you don't have it

55:35.940 --> 55:37.220
 in the first place.

55:37.220 --> 55:38.620
 If you already know your hardware,

55:38.620 --> 55:40.700
 you can maybe handcraft it.

55:40.700 --> 55:41.900
 But if you don't know your hardware,

55:41.900 --> 55:43.740
 you can search for such an architecture.

55:43.740 --> 55:46.980
 And this work already existed in the 80s and 90s.

55:46.980 --> 55:49.820
 People were starting to search for control architectures

55:49.820 --> 55:51.140
 by motor babbling and so on,

55:51.140 --> 55:53.900
 and just use reinforcement learning architectures

55:53.900 --> 55:55.580
 to discover such a thing.

55:55.580 --> 55:57.740
 And now imagine that you have

55:57.740 --> 56:01.540
 the cybernetic control architecture already inside of you.

56:01.540 --> 56:03.700
 And you extend this a little bit.

56:03.700 --> 56:06.460
 So you are seeking out food, for instance,

56:06.460 --> 56:08.300
 or rest or and so on.

56:08.300 --> 56:11.820
 And you get to have a baby at some point.

56:11.820 --> 56:15.740
 And now you add more and more control layers to this.

56:15.740 --> 56:17.780
 And the system is reverse engineering

56:17.780 --> 56:19.620
 its own control architecture

56:19.620 --> 56:22.460
 and builds a high level model to synchronize

56:22.460 --> 56:26.340
 the pursuit of very different conflicting goals.

56:26.340 --> 56:28.180
 And this is how I think you get to purposes.

56:28.180 --> 56:30.060
 Purposes are models of your goals.

56:30.060 --> 56:31.540
 The goals may be intrinsic

56:31.540 --> 56:33.820
 as the result of the different set point violations

56:33.820 --> 56:34.660
 that you have,

56:34.660 --> 56:37.140
 hunger and thirst for very different things,

56:37.140 --> 56:39.380
 and rest and pain avoidance and so on.

56:39.380 --> 56:41.100
 And you put all these things together

56:41.100 --> 56:44.180
 and eventually you need to come up with a strategy

56:44.180 --> 56:46.020
 to synchronize them all.

56:46.020 --> 56:49.340
 And you don't need just to do this alone by yourself

56:49.340 --> 56:51.340
 because we are state building organisms.

56:51.340 --> 56:53.700
 We cannot function as isolation

56:53.700 --> 56:55.820
 the way that homo sapiens is set up.

56:55.820 --> 56:58.100
 So our own behavior only makes sense

56:58.100 --> 57:00.980
 when you zoom out very far into a society

57:00.980 --> 57:04.900
 or even into ecosystemic intelligence on the planet

57:04.900 --> 57:06.500
 and our place in it.

57:06.500 --> 57:08.460
 So the individual behavior only makes sense

57:08.460 --> 57:09.980
 in these larger contexts.

57:09.980 --> 57:11.820
 And we have a number of priors built into us.

57:11.820 --> 57:14.660
 So we are behaving as if we were acting

57:14.660 --> 57:17.900
 on these high level goals pretty much right from the start.

57:17.900 --> 57:19.820
 And eventually in the course of our life,

57:19.820 --> 57:22.700
 we can reverse engineer the goals that we're acting on,

57:22.700 --> 57:25.820
 what actually are our higher level purposes.

57:25.820 --> 57:27.100
 And the more we understand that,

57:27.100 --> 57:28.660
 the more our behavior makes sense.

57:28.660 --> 57:30.380
 But this is all at this point,

57:30.380 --> 57:32.420
 complex stories within stories

57:32.420 --> 57:34.580
 that are driving our behavior.

57:34.580 --> 57:38.500
 Yeah, I just don't know how big of a leap it is

57:38.500 --> 57:40.940
 to start create a system

57:40.940 --> 57:42.980
 that's able to tell stories within stories.

57:44.340 --> 57:45.580
 Like how big of a leap that is

57:45.580 --> 57:48.260
 from where currently Boston Dynamics is

57:48.260 --> 57:50.900
 or any robot that's operating in the physical space.

57:53.820 --> 57:56.220
 And that leap might be big

57:56.220 --> 57:59.380
 if it requires to solve the hard problem of consciousness,

57:59.380 --> 58:01.620
 which is telling a hell of a good story.

58:01.620 --> 58:05.220
 I suspect that consciousness itself is relatively simple.

58:05.220 --> 58:06.420
 What's hard is perception

58:07.300 --> 58:09.860
 and the interface between perception and reasoning.

58:11.100 --> 58:14.700
 That's for instance, the idea of the consciousness prior

58:14.700 --> 58:18.740
 that would be built into such a system by Yoshua Bengio.

58:18.740 --> 58:22.260
 And what he describes, and I think that's accurate,

58:22.260 --> 58:27.260
 is that our own model of the world

58:27.260 --> 58:29.820
 can be described through something like an energy function.

58:29.820 --> 58:32.700
 The energy function is modeling the contradictions

58:32.700 --> 58:34.820
 that exist within the model at any given point.

58:34.820 --> 58:36.620
 And you try to minimize these contradictions,

58:36.620 --> 58:38.340
 the tangents in the model.

58:38.340 --> 58:41.380
 And to do this, you need to sometimes test things.

58:41.380 --> 58:43.740
 You need to conditionally disambiguate figure and ground.

58:43.740 --> 58:46.500
 You need to distinguish whether this is true

58:46.500 --> 58:47.940
 or that is true, and so on.

58:47.940 --> 58:49.500
 Eventually you get to an interpretation,

58:49.500 --> 58:52.300
 but you will need to manually depress a few points

58:52.300 --> 58:55.580
 in your model to let it snap into a state that makes sense.

58:55.580 --> 58:57.740
 And this function that tries to get the biggest dip

58:57.740 --> 58:59.620
 in the energy function in your model,

58:59.620 --> 59:02.340
 according to Yoshua Bengio, is related to consciousness.

59:02.340 --> 59:04.620
 It's a low dimensional discrete function

59:04.620 --> 59:08.220
 that tries to maximize this dip in the energy function.

59:09.580 --> 59:13.340
 Yeah, I think I would need to dig into details

59:13.340 --> 59:15.580
 because I think the way he uses the word consciousness

59:15.580 --> 59:17.780
 is more akin to like self awareness,

59:17.780 --> 59:20.860
 like modeling yourself within the world,

59:20.860 --> 59:23.660
 as opposed to the subjective experience, the hard problem.

59:23.660 --> 59:26.580
 No, it's not even the self is in the world.

59:26.580 --> 59:28.820
 The self is the agent and you don't need to be aware

59:28.820 --> 59:31.100
 of yourself in order to be conscious.

59:31.100 --> 59:34.380
 The self is just a particular content that you can have,

59:34.380 --> 59:35.980
 but you don't have to have.

59:35.980 --> 59:39.700
 But you can be conscious in, for instance, a dream at night

59:39.700 --> 59:42.940
 or during a meditation state where you don't have a self.

59:42.940 --> 59:43.780
 Right.

59:43.780 --> 59:45.620
 Where you're just aware of the fact that you are aware.

59:45.620 --> 59:49.900
 And what we mean by consciousness in the colloquial sense

59:49.900 --> 59:53.820
 is largely this reflexive self awareness,

59:53.820 --> 59:55.220
 that we become aware of the fact

59:55.220 --> 59:57.300
 that you're paying attention,

59:57.300 --> 59:59.220
 that we are the thing that pays attention.

59:59.220 --> 1:00:02.020
 We are the thing that pays attention, right.

1:00:02.020 --> 1:00:07.020
 I don't see where the awareness that we're aware,

1:00:07.740 --> 1:00:10.620
 the hard problem doesn't feel like it's solved.

1:00:10.620 --> 1:00:14.820
 I mean, it's called a hard problem for a reason,

1:00:14.820 --> 1:00:19.380
 because it seems like there needs to be a major leap.

1:00:19.380 --> 1:00:21.660
 Yeah, I think the major leap is to understand

1:00:21.660 --> 1:00:25.300
 how it is possible that a machine can dream,

1:00:25.300 --> 1:00:29.540
 that a physical system is able to create a representation

1:00:29.540 --> 1:00:31.260
 that the physical system is acting on,

1:00:31.260 --> 1:00:33.980
 and that is spun force and so on.

1:00:33.980 --> 1:00:36.700
 But once you accept the fact that you are not in physics,

1:00:36.700 --> 1:00:39.220
 but that you exist inside of the story,

1:00:39.220 --> 1:00:40.620
 I think the mystery disappears.

1:00:40.620 --> 1:00:41.940
 Everything is possible in the story.

1:00:41.940 --> 1:00:43.340
 You exist inside the story.

1:00:43.340 --> 1:00:44.180
 Okay, so the machine.

1:00:44.180 --> 1:00:45.780
 Your consciousness is being written into the story.

1:00:45.780 --> 1:00:47.340
 The fact that you experience things

1:00:47.340 --> 1:00:48.860
 is written to the side of the story.

1:00:48.860 --> 1:00:51.300
 You ask yourself, is this real what I'm seeing?

1:00:51.300 --> 1:00:53.860
 And your brain writes into the story, yes, it's real.

1:00:53.860 --> 1:00:56.340
 So what about the perception of consciousness?

1:00:56.340 --> 1:00:59.540
 So to me, you look conscious.

1:00:59.540 --> 1:01:02.500
 So the illusion of consciousness,

1:01:02.500 --> 1:01:04.340
 the demonstration of consciousness.

1:01:04.340 --> 1:01:07.700
 I ask for the legged robot.

1:01:07.700 --> 1:01:10.580
 How do we make this legged robot conscious?

1:01:10.580 --> 1:01:12.820
 So there's two things,

1:01:12.820 --> 1:01:16.340
 and maybe you can tell me if they're neighboring ideas.

1:01:16.340 --> 1:01:18.860
 One is actually make it conscious,

1:01:18.860 --> 1:01:21.700
 and the other is make it appear conscious to others.

1:01:22.620 --> 1:01:23.740
 Are those related?

1:01:25.660 --> 1:01:27.380
 Let's ask it from the other direction.

1:01:27.380 --> 1:01:30.060
 What would it take to make you not conscious?

1:01:31.140 --> 1:01:35.180
 So when you are thinking about how you perceive the world,

1:01:35.180 --> 1:01:39.820
 can you decide to switch from looking at qualia

1:01:39.820 --> 1:01:41.820
 to looking at representational states?

1:01:43.060 --> 1:01:44.900
 And it turns out you can.

1:01:44.900 --> 1:01:48.340
 There is a particular way in which you can look at the world

1:01:48.340 --> 1:01:51.420
 and recognize its machine nature, including your own.

1:01:51.420 --> 1:01:52.420
 And in that state,

1:01:52.420 --> 1:01:54.260
 you don't have that conscious experience

1:01:54.260 --> 1:01:55.740
 in this way anymore.

1:01:55.740 --> 1:01:59.660
 It becomes apparent as a representation.

1:01:59.660 --> 1:02:01.580
 Everything becomes opaque.

1:02:01.580 --> 1:02:04.020
 And I think this thing that you recognize,

1:02:04.020 --> 1:02:05.380
 everything is a representation.

1:02:05.380 --> 1:02:08.220
 This is typically what we mean with enlightenment states.

1:02:09.100 --> 1:02:11.700
 And it can happen on the motivational level,

1:02:11.700 --> 1:02:14.820
 but you can also do this on the experiential level,

1:02:14.820 --> 1:02:16.220
 on the perceptual level.

1:02:16.220 --> 1:02:18.820
 See, but then I can come back to a conscious state.

1:02:20.420 --> 1:02:22.180
 Okay, I particularly,

1:02:23.780 --> 1:02:26.940
 I'm referring to the social aspect

1:02:26.940 --> 1:02:30.100
 that the demonstration of consciousness

1:02:30.100 --> 1:02:32.140
 is a really nice thing at a party

1:02:32.140 --> 1:02:34.460
 when you're trying to meet a new person.

1:02:34.460 --> 1:02:38.300
 It's a nice thing to know that they're conscious

1:02:38.300 --> 1:02:39.380
 and they can,

1:02:41.020 --> 1:02:42.700
 I don't know how fundamental consciousness

1:02:42.700 --> 1:02:43.900
 is in human interaction,

1:02:43.900 --> 1:02:48.020
 but it seems like to be at least an important part.

1:02:48.020 --> 1:02:53.020
 And I ask that in the same kind of way for robots.

1:02:53.620 --> 1:02:56.340
 In order to create a rich, compelling

1:02:56.340 --> 1:02:58.380
 human robot interaction,

1:02:58.380 --> 1:03:00.740
 it feels like there needs to be elements of consciousness

1:03:00.740 --> 1:03:02.660
 within that interaction.

1:03:02.660 --> 1:03:04.900
 My cat is obviously conscious.

1:03:04.900 --> 1:03:07.380
 And so my cat can do this party trick.

1:03:07.380 --> 1:03:09.220
 She also knows that I am conscious,

1:03:09.220 --> 1:03:11.380
 be able to have feedback about the fact

1:03:11.380 --> 1:03:14.860
 that we are both acting on models of our own awareness.

1:03:14.860 --> 1:03:19.660
 The question is how hard is it for the robot,

1:03:19.660 --> 1:03:22.060
 artificially created robot to achieve cat level

1:03:22.060 --> 1:03:24.380
 and party tricks?

1:03:24.380 --> 1:03:27.300
 Yes, so the issue for me is currently not so much

1:03:27.300 --> 1:03:30.300
 on how to build a system that creates a story

1:03:30.300 --> 1:03:32.860
 about a robot that lives in the world,

1:03:32.860 --> 1:03:35.500
 but to make an adequate representation of the world.

1:03:36.540 --> 1:03:40.260
 And the model that you and me have is a unified one.

1:03:40.260 --> 1:03:44.060
 It's one where you basically make sense of everything

1:03:44.060 --> 1:03:44.980
 that you can perceive.

1:03:44.980 --> 1:03:47.940
 Every feature in the world that enters your perception

1:03:47.940 --> 1:03:51.780
 can be relationally mapped to a unified model of everything.

1:03:51.780 --> 1:03:54.060
 And we don't have an AI that is able to construct

1:03:54.060 --> 1:03:56.220
 such a unified model yet.

1:03:56.220 --> 1:03:58.820
 So you need that unified model to do the party trick?

1:03:58.820 --> 1:04:01.780
 Yes, I think that it doesn't make sense

1:04:01.780 --> 1:04:03.060
 if this thing is conscious,

1:04:03.060 --> 1:04:04.660
 but not in the same universe as you,

1:04:04.660 --> 1:04:06.780
 because you could not relate to each other.

1:04:06.780 --> 1:04:08.980
 So what's the process, would you say,

1:04:08.980 --> 1:04:12.060
 of engineering consciousness in the machine?

1:04:12.060 --> 1:04:14.580
 Like what are the ideas here?

1:04:14.580 --> 1:04:19.060
 So you probably want to have some kind of perceptual system.

1:04:19.060 --> 1:04:21.300
 This perceptual system is a processing agent

1:04:21.300 --> 1:04:23.860
 that is able to track sensory data

1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:26.740
 and predict the next frame in the sensory data

1:04:26.740 --> 1:04:29.780
 from the previous frames of the sensory data

1:04:29.780 --> 1:04:31.740
 and the current state of the system.

1:04:31.740 --> 1:04:34.580
 So the current state of the system is, in perception,

1:04:34.580 --> 1:04:37.580
 instrumental to predicting what happens next.

1:04:37.580 --> 1:04:39.780
 And this means you build lots and lots of functions

1:04:39.780 --> 1:04:42.100
 that take all the blips that you feel on your skin

1:04:42.100 --> 1:04:45.540
 and that you see on your retina, or that you hear,

1:04:45.540 --> 1:04:48.100
 and puts them into a set of relationships

1:04:48.100 --> 1:04:51.180
 that allows you to predict what kind of sensory data,

1:04:51.180 --> 1:04:53.780
 what kind of sensor of blips, vector of blips,

1:04:53.780 --> 1:04:56.060
 you're going to perceive in the next frame.

1:04:56.060 --> 1:04:59.180
 This is tuned and it's constantly tuned

1:04:59.180 --> 1:05:01.940
 until it gets as accurate as it can.

1:05:01.940 --> 1:05:05.100
 You build a very accurate prediction mechanism

1:05:05.100 --> 1:05:08.060
 that is step one of the perception.

1:05:08.060 --> 1:05:09.900
 So first you predict, then you perceive

1:05:09.900 --> 1:05:11.740
 and see the error in your prediction.

1:05:11.740 --> 1:05:13.820
 And you have to do two things to make that happen.

1:05:13.820 --> 1:05:16.900
 One is you have to build a network of relationships

1:05:16.900 --> 1:05:18.460
 that are constraints,

1:05:18.460 --> 1:05:21.020
 that take all the variants in the world

1:05:21.020 --> 1:05:24.420
 and put each of the variances into a variable

1:05:24.420 --> 1:05:27.940
 that is connected with relationships to other variables.

1:05:27.940 --> 1:05:30.060
 And these relationships are computable functions

1:05:30.060 --> 1:05:31.140
 that constrain each other.

1:05:31.140 --> 1:05:32.260
 So when you see a nose

1:05:32.260 --> 1:05:34.900
 that points in a certain direction in space,

1:05:34.900 --> 1:05:36.100
 you have a constraint that says

1:05:36.100 --> 1:05:39.260
 there should be a face nearby that has the same direction.

1:05:39.260 --> 1:05:40.380
 And if that is not the case,

1:05:40.380 --> 1:05:41.700
 you have some kind of contradiction

1:05:41.700 --> 1:05:42.540
 that you need to resolve

1:05:42.540 --> 1:05:44.620
 because it's probably not a nose what you're looking at.

1:05:44.620 --> 1:05:45.940
 It just looks like one.

1:05:45.940 --> 1:05:48.580
 So you have to reinterpret the data

1:05:48.580 --> 1:05:52.460
 until you get to a point where your model converges.

1:05:52.460 --> 1:05:54.940
 And this process of making the sensory data

1:05:54.940 --> 1:05:56.700
 fit into your model structure

1:05:56.700 --> 1:06:01.140
 is what Piaget calls the assimilation.

1:06:01.140 --> 1:06:04.060
 And accommodation is the change of the models

1:06:04.060 --> 1:06:05.700
 where you change your model in such a way

1:06:05.700 --> 1:06:08.140
 that you can assimilate everything.

1:06:08.140 --> 1:06:09.860
 So you're talking about building

1:06:09.860 --> 1:06:12.380
 a hell of an awesome perception system

1:06:12.380 --> 1:06:14.700
 that's able to do prediction and perception

1:06:14.700 --> 1:06:15.980
 and correct and keep improving.

1:06:15.980 --> 1:06:17.740
 No, wait, that's...

1:06:17.740 --> 1:06:18.660
 Wait, there's more.

1:06:18.660 --> 1:06:19.580
 Yes, there's more.

1:06:19.580 --> 1:06:21.500
 So the first thing that we wanted to do

1:06:21.500 --> 1:06:24.660
 is we want to minimize the contradictions in the model.

1:06:24.660 --> 1:06:26.700
 And of course, it's very easy to make a model

1:06:26.700 --> 1:06:28.220
 in which you minimize the contradictions

1:06:28.220 --> 1:06:29.700
 just by allowing that it can be

1:06:29.700 --> 1:06:31.500
 in many, many possible states, right?

1:06:31.500 --> 1:06:33.980
 So if you increase degrees of freedom,

1:06:33.980 --> 1:06:35.860
 you will have fewer contradictions.

1:06:35.860 --> 1:06:37.820
 But you also want to reduce the degrees of freedom

1:06:37.820 --> 1:06:40.260
 because degrees of freedom mean uncertainty.

1:06:40.260 --> 1:06:42.420
 You want your model to reduce uncertainty

1:06:42.420 --> 1:06:44.380
 as much as possible,

1:06:44.380 --> 1:06:46.540
 but reducing uncertainty is expensive.

1:06:46.540 --> 1:06:47.780
 So you have to have a trade off

1:06:47.780 --> 1:06:50.340
 between minimizing contradictions

1:06:50.340 --> 1:06:52.380
 and reducing uncertainty.

1:06:52.380 --> 1:06:54.620
 And you have only a finite amount of compute

1:06:54.620 --> 1:06:57.020
 and experimental time and effort

1:06:57.020 --> 1:06:59.260
 available to reduce uncertainty in the world.

1:06:59.260 --> 1:07:02.740
 So you need to assign value to what you observe.

1:07:02.740 --> 1:07:05.060
 So you need some kind of motivational system

1:07:05.060 --> 1:07:07.660
 that is estimating what you should be looking at

1:07:07.660 --> 1:07:09.180
 and what you should be thinking about it,

1:07:09.180 --> 1:07:10.900
 how you should be applying your resources

1:07:10.900 --> 1:07:12.900
 to model what that is, right?

1:07:12.900 --> 1:07:15.940
 So you need to have something like convergence links

1:07:15.940 --> 1:07:17.540
 that tell you how to get from the present state

1:07:17.540 --> 1:07:19.020
 of the model to the next one.

1:07:19.020 --> 1:07:20.620
 You need to have these compatibility links

1:07:20.620 --> 1:07:23.500
 that tell you which constraints exist

1:07:23.500 --> 1:07:25.500
 and which constraint violations exist.

1:07:25.500 --> 1:07:28.900
 And you need to have some kind of motivational system

1:07:28.900 --> 1:07:30.700
 that tells you what to pay attention to.

1:07:30.700 --> 1:07:32.980
 So now we have a second agent next to the perceptual agent.

1:07:32.980 --> 1:07:34.860
 We have a motivational agent.

1:07:34.860 --> 1:07:36.260
 This is a cybernetic system

1:07:36.260 --> 1:07:38.740
 that is modeling what the system needs,

1:07:38.740 --> 1:07:40.460
 what's important for the system,

1:07:40.460 --> 1:07:42.100
 and that interacts with the perceptual system

1:07:42.100 --> 1:07:44.540
 to maximize the expected reward.

1:07:44.540 --> 1:07:46.020
 And you're saying the motivational system

1:07:46.020 --> 1:07:49.580
 is some kind of like, what is it?

1:07:49.580 --> 1:07:52.500
 A high level narrative over some lower level.

1:07:52.500 --> 1:07:53.980
 No, it's just your brainstem stuff,

1:07:53.980 --> 1:07:55.660
 the limbic system stuff that tells you,

1:07:55.660 --> 1:07:57.660
 okay, now you should get something to eat

1:07:57.660 --> 1:07:59.380
 because I've just measured your blood sugar.

1:07:59.380 --> 1:08:00.940
 So you mean like motivational system,

1:08:00.940 --> 1:08:03.060
 like the lower level stuff, like hungry.

1:08:03.060 --> 1:08:05.700
 Yes, there's basically physiological needs

1:08:05.700 --> 1:08:07.500
 and some cognitive needs and some social needs

1:08:07.500 --> 1:08:08.420
 and they all interact.

1:08:08.420 --> 1:08:10.220
 And they're all implemented at different parts

1:08:10.220 --> 1:08:12.660
 in your nervous system as the motivational system.

1:08:12.660 --> 1:08:14.700
 But they're basically cybernetic feedback loops.

1:08:14.700 --> 1:08:16.420
 It's not that complicated.

1:08:16.420 --> 1:08:18.260
 It's just a lot of code.

1:08:18.260 --> 1:08:21.420
 And so you now have a motivational agent

1:08:21.420 --> 1:08:23.100
 that makes your robot go for the ball

1:08:23.100 --> 1:08:27.580
 or that makes your worm go to eat food and so on.

1:08:27.580 --> 1:08:29.140
 And you have the perceptual system

1:08:29.140 --> 1:08:30.580
 that lets it predict the environment

1:08:30.580 --> 1:08:33.620
 so it's able to solve that control problem to some degree.

1:08:33.620 --> 1:08:35.780
 And now what we learned is that it's very hard

1:08:35.780 --> 1:08:37.220
 to build a machine learning system

1:08:37.220 --> 1:08:39.340
 that looks at all the data simultaneously

1:08:39.340 --> 1:08:41.300
 to see what kind of relationships

1:08:41.300 --> 1:08:43.260
 could exist between them.

1:08:43.260 --> 1:08:45.580
 So you need to selectively model the world.

1:08:45.580 --> 1:08:48.300
 You need to figure out where can I make the biggest difference

1:08:48.300 --> 1:08:50.980
 if I would put the following things together.

1:08:50.980 --> 1:08:53.020
 Sometimes you find a gradient for that.

1:08:53.020 --> 1:08:54.180
 When you have a gradient,

1:08:54.180 --> 1:08:56.460
 you don't need to remember where you came from.

1:08:56.460 --> 1:08:57.540
 You just follow the gradient

1:08:57.540 --> 1:08:59.340
 until it doesn't get any better.

1:08:59.340 --> 1:09:02.140
 But if you have a world where the problems are discontinuous

1:09:02.140 --> 1:09:04.260
 and the search spaces are discontinuous,

1:09:04.260 --> 1:09:07.300
 you need to retain memory of what you explored.

1:09:07.300 --> 1:09:10.540
 You need to construct a plan of what to explore next.

1:09:10.540 --> 1:09:13.300
 And this thing means that you have next

1:09:13.300 --> 1:09:15.340
 to this perceptual construction system

1:09:15.340 --> 1:09:17.620
 and the motivational cybernetics,

1:09:17.620 --> 1:09:20.220
 an agent that is paying attention

1:09:20.220 --> 1:09:22.700
 to what it should select at any given moment

1:09:22.700 --> 1:09:24.300
 to maximize reward.

1:09:24.300 --> 1:09:27.460
 And this scanning system, this attention agent,

1:09:27.460 --> 1:09:28.900
 is required for consciousness

1:09:28.900 --> 1:09:31.420
 and consciousness is its control model.

1:09:32.580 --> 1:09:36.140
 So it's the index memories that this thing retains

1:09:36.140 --> 1:09:39.180
 when it manipulates the perceptual representations

1:09:39.180 --> 1:09:43.020
 to maximize the value and minimize the conflicts

1:09:43.020 --> 1:09:44.820
 and to increase coherence.

1:09:44.820 --> 1:09:47.740
 So the purpose of consciousness is to create coherence

1:09:47.740 --> 1:09:49.500
 in your perceptual representations,

1:09:49.500 --> 1:09:52.140
 remove conflicts, predict the future,

1:09:52.140 --> 1:09:54.100
 construct counterfactual representations

1:09:54.100 --> 1:09:56.300
 so you can coordinate your actions and so on.

1:09:57.460 --> 1:10:00.220
 And in order to do this, it needs to form memories.

1:10:00.220 --> 1:10:02.340
 These memories are partial binding states

1:10:02.340 --> 1:10:04.100
 of the working memory contents

1:10:04.100 --> 1:10:07.100
 that are being revisited later on to backtrack,

1:10:07.100 --> 1:10:10.140
 to undo certain states, to look for alternatives.

1:10:10.140 --> 1:10:13.020
 And these index memories that you can recall,

1:10:13.020 --> 1:10:15.940
 that is what you perceive as your stream of consciousness.

1:10:15.940 --> 1:10:17.860
 And being able to recall these memories,

1:10:17.860 --> 1:10:19.420
 this is what makes you conscious.

1:10:19.420 --> 1:10:21.660
 If you could not remember what you paid attention to,

1:10:21.660 --> 1:10:22.980
 you wouldn't be conscious.

1:10:26.180 --> 1:10:29.140
 So consciousness is the index in the memory database.

1:10:29.140 --> 1:10:29.980
 Okay.

1:10:31.380 --> 1:10:35.500
 But let me sneak up to the questions of consciousness

1:10:35.500 --> 1:10:37.180
 a little further.

1:10:37.180 --> 1:10:42.180
 So we usually relate suffering to consciousness.

1:10:42.660 --> 1:10:44.340
 So the capacity to suffer.

1:10:46.260 --> 1:10:49.700
 I think to me, that's a really strong sign of consciousness

1:10:49.700 --> 1:10:51.180
 is a thing that can suffer.

1:10:52.460 --> 1:10:54.100
 How is that useful?

1:10:55.100 --> 1:10:55.940
 Suffering.

1:10:57.140 --> 1:10:59.540
 And like in your model where you just described,

1:10:59.540 --> 1:11:03.740
 which is indexing of memories and what is the coherence

1:11:03.740 --> 1:11:07.220
 with the perception, with this predictive thing

1:11:07.220 --> 1:11:09.260
 that's going on in the perception,

1:11:09.260 --> 1:11:11.700
 how does suffering relate to any of that?

1:11:13.060 --> 1:11:15.060
 The higher level suffering that humans do.

1:11:16.580 --> 1:11:20.020
 Basically pain is a reinforcement signal.

1:11:20.020 --> 1:11:23.380
 Pain is a signal that one part of your brain

1:11:23.380 --> 1:11:25.140
 sends to another part of your brain,

1:11:25.140 --> 1:11:27.940
 or in an abstract sense, part of your mind

1:11:27.940 --> 1:11:30.860
 sends to another part of the mind to regulate its behavior,

1:11:30.860 --> 1:11:33.540
 to tell it the behavior that you're currently exhibiting

1:11:33.540 --> 1:11:34.940
 should be improved.

1:11:34.940 --> 1:11:39.020
 And this is the signal that I tell you to move away

1:11:39.020 --> 1:11:40.180
 from what you're currently doing

1:11:40.180 --> 1:11:42.300
 and push into a different direction.

1:11:42.300 --> 1:11:46.060
 So pain gives you a part of you an impulse

1:11:46.060 --> 1:11:47.940
 to do something differently.

1:11:47.940 --> 1:11:49.940
 But sometimes this doesn't work

1:11:49.940 --> 1:11:52.140
 because the training part of your brain

1:11:52.140 --> 1:11:54.220
 is talking to the wrong region,

1:11:54.220 --> 1:11:55.900
 or because it has the wrong model

1:11:55.900 --> 1:11:57.180
 of the relationships in the world.

1:11:57.180 --> 1:11:58.580
 Maybe you're mismodeling yourself

1:11:58.580 --> 1:12:00.860
 or you're mismodeling the relationship of yourself

1:12:00.860 --> 1:12:01.700
 to the world,

1:12:01.700 --> 1:12:03.500
 or you're mismodeling the dynamics of the world.

1:12:03.500 --> 1:12:04.940
 So you're trying to improve something

1:12:04.940 --> 1:12:07.900
 that cannot be improved by generating more pain.

1:12:07.900 --> 1:12:10.380
 But the system doesn't have any alternative.

1:12:10.380 --> 1:12:12.340
 So it doesn't get better.

1:12:12.340 --> 1:12:14.220
 What do you do if something doesn't get better

1:12:14.220 --> 1:12:15.540
 and you want it to get better?

1:12:15.540 --> 1:12:17.940
 You increase the strengths of the signal.

1:12:17.940 --> 1:12:19.580
 And then the signal becomes chronic

1:12:19.580 --> 1:12:22.220
 when it becomes permanent without a change inside.

1:12:22.220 --> 1:12:24.300
 This is what we call suffering.

1:12:24.300 --> 1:12:26.420
 And the purpose of consciousness

1:12:26.420 --> 1:12:28.180
 is to deal with contradictions,

1:12:28.180 --> 1:12:30.300
 with things that cannot be resolved.

1:12:30.300 --> 1:12:31.740
 The purpose of consciousness,

1:12:31.740 --> 1:12:35.060
 I think is similar to a conductor in an orchestra.

1:12:35.060 --> 1:12:36.420
 When everything works well,

1:12:36.420 --> 1:12:38.580
 the orchestra doesn't need much of a conductor

1:12:38.580 --> 1:12:40.260
 as long as it's coherent.

1:12:40.260 --> 1:12:42.020
 But when there is a lack of coherence

1:12:42.020 --> 1:12:44.340
 or something is consistently producing

1:12:44.340 --> 1:12:46.220
 disharmony and mismatches,

1:12:46.220 --> 1:12:48.980
 then the conductor becomes alert and interacts with it.

1:12:48.980 --> 1:12:52.660
 So suffering attracts the activity of our consciousness.

1:12:52.660 --> 1:12:54.740
 And the purpose of that is ideally

1:12:54.740 --> 1:12:56.660
 that we bring new layers online,

1:12:56.660 --> 1:13:00.460
 new layers of modeling that are able to create

1:13:00.460 --> 1:13:03.620
 a model of the dysregulation so we can deal with it.

1:13:04.500 --> 1:13:06.860
 And this means that we typically get

1:13:06.860 --> 1:13:08.820
 higher level consciousness, so to speak, right?

1:13:08.820 --> 1:13:11.420
 We get some consciousness above our pay grade maybe

1:13:11.420 --> 1:13:13.260
 if we have some suffering early in our life.

1:13:13.260 --> 1:13:14.820
 Most of the interesting people

1:13:14.820 --> 1:13:17.060
 had trauma early on in their childhood.

1:13:17.060 --> 1:13:20.940
 And trauma means that you are suffering an injury

1:13:20.940 --> 1:13:23.060
 for which the system is not prepared,

1:13:23.060 --> 1:13:24.380
 which it cannot deal with,

1:13:24.380 --> 1:13:26.260
 which it cannot insulate itself from.

1:13:26.260 --> 1:13:27.940
 So something breaks.

1:13:27.940 --> 1:13:29.860
 And this means that the behavior of the system

1:13:29.860 --> 1:13:34.020
 is permanently disturbed in a way

1:13:34.020 --> 1:13:37.500
 that some mismatch exists now in the regulation

1:13:37.500 --> 1:13:39.100
 that just by following your impulses,

1:13:39.100 --> 1:13:41.860
 by following the pain in the direction where it hurts,

1:13:41.860 --> 1:13:44.380
 the situation doesn't improve but get worse.

1:13:44.380 --> 1:13:46.940
 And so what needs to happen is that you grow up.

1:13:47.940 --> 1:13:49.540
 And that's part that has grown up

1:13:49.540 --> 1:13:51.180
 is able to deal with the part

1:13:51.180 --> 1:13:53.340
 that is stuck in this earlier phase.

1:13:53.340 --> 1:13:54.580
 Yeah, so at least to grow,

1:13:54.580 --> 1:13:58.060
 so you're adding extra layers to your cognition.

1:13:58.060 --> 1:14:00.380
 And let me ask you then,

1:14:00.380 --> 1:14:02.380
 because I gotta stick on suffering,

1:14:02.380 --> 1:14:03.860
 the ethics of the whole thing.

1:14:05.420 --> 1:14:08.900
 So not our consciousness, but the consciousness of others.

1:14:08.900 --> 1:14:13.380
 You've tweeted, one of my biggest fears

1:14:13.380 --> 1:14:16.260
 is that insects could be conscious.

1:14:16.260 --> 1:14:18.980
 The amount of suffering on earth would be unthinkable.

1:14:20.300 --> 1:14:24.380
 So when we think of other conscious beings,

1:14:24.380 --> 1:14:29.380
 is suffering a property of consciousness

1:14:30.300 --> 1:14:32.660
 that we're most concerned about?

1:14:32.660 --> 1:14:37.660
 So I'm still thinking about robots,

1:14:40.140 --> 1:14:43.140
 how to make sense of other nonhuman things

1:14:44.540 --> 1:14:48.380
 that appear to have the depth of experience

1:14:48.380 --> 1:14:49.460
 that humans have.

1:14:50.700 --> 1:14:54.020
 And to me, that means consciousness

1:14:54.020 --> 1:14:57.460
 and the darkest side of that, which is suffering,

1:14:57.460 --> 1:14:58.860
 the capacity to suffer.

1:15:00.380 --> 1:15:02.420
 And so I started thinking,

1:15:02.420 --> 1:15:04.100
 how much responsibility do we have

1:15:04.100 --> 1:15:06.620
 for those other conscious beings?

1:15:06.620 --> 1:15:10.980
 That's where the definition of consciousness

1:15:10.980 --> 1:15:13.100
 becomes most urgent.

1:15:13.100 --> 1:15:15.140
 Like having to come up with a definition of consciousness

1:15:15.140 --> 1:15:16.900
 becomes most urgent,

1:15:16.900 --> 1:15:24.740
 is who should we and should we not be torturing?

1:15:24.740 --> 1:15:26.300
 There's no general answer to this.

1:15:26.300 --> 1:15:29.100
 Was Genghis Khan doing anything wrong?

1:15:29.100 --> 1:15:31.900
 It depends right on how you look at it.

1:15:31.900 --> 1:15:35.340
 Well, he drew a line somewhere

1:15:36.300 --> 1:15:38.820
 where this is us and that's them.

1:15:38.820 --> 1:15:40.820
 It's the circle of empathy.

1:15:40.820 --> 1:15:42.860
 It's like these,

1:15:42.860 --> 1:15:44.820
 you don't have to use the word consciousness,

1:15:44.820 --> 1:15:48.980
 but these are the things that matter to me

1:15:48.980 --> 1:15:50.100
 if they suffer or not.

1:15:50.100 --> 1:15:52.340
 And these are the things that don't matter to him.

1:15:52.340 --> 1:15:54.580
 Yeah, but when one of his commanders failed him,

1:15:54.580 --> 1:15:59.140
 he broke his spine and let him die in a horrible way.

1:15:59.140 --> 1:16:01.420
 And so in some sense,

1:16:01.420 --> 1:16:03.860
 I think he was indifferent to suffering

1:16:03.860 --> 1:16:05.820
 or he was not different in the sense

1:16:05.820 --> 1:16:09.420
 that he didn't see it as useful if he inflicted suffering,

1:16:10.380 --> 1:16:14.100
 but he did not see it as something that had to be avoided.

1:16:14.100 --> 1:16:15.460
 That was not the goal.

1:16:15.460 --> 1:16:18.860
 The question was, how can I use suffering

1:16:18.860 --> 1:16:21.260
 and the infliction of suffering to reach my goals

1:16:21.260 --> 1:16:22.420
 from his perspective?

1:16:23.900 --> 1:16:24.740
 I see.

1:16:24.740 --> 1:16:26.700
 So like different societies throughout history

1:16:26.700 --> 1:16:29.940
 put different value on the...

1:16:29.940 --> 1:16:31.580
 Different individuals, different psyches.

1:16:31.580 --> 1:16:35.100
 But also even the objective of avoiding suffering,

1:16:35.100 --> 1:16:37.540
 like some societies probably,

1:16:37.540 --> 1:16:40.740
 I mean, this is where like religious belief really helps

1:16:40.740 --> 1:16:44.700
 that afterlife, that it doesn't matter

1:16:44.700 --> 1:16:45.980
 that you suffer or die,

1:16:45.980 --> 1:16:49.300
 what matters is you suffer honorably, right?

1:16:49.300 --> 1:16:52.260
 So that you enter the afterlife as a hero.

1:16:52.260 --> 1:16:53.860
 It seems to be superstitious to me,

1:16:53.860 --> 1:16:57.580
 basically beliefs that assert things

1:16:57.580 --> 1:17:00.020
 for which no evidence exists

1:17:00.020 --> 1:17:02.180
 are incompatible with sound epistemology.

1:17:02.180 --> 1:17:04.620
 And I don't think that religion has to be superstitious,

1:17:04.620 --> 1:17:06.860
 otherwise it should be condemned in all cases.

1:17:06.860 --> 1:17:09.140
 You're somebody who's saying we live in a dream world,

1:17:09.140 --> 1:17:11.340
 we have zero evidence for anything.

1:17:11.340 --> 1:17:12.180
 So...

1:17:12.180 --> 1:17:13.500
 That's not the case.

1:17:13.500 --> 1:17:16.060
 There are limits to what languages can be constructed.

1:17:16.060 --> 1:17:19.500
 Mathematics brings solid evidence for its own structure.

1:17:19.500 --> 1:17:23.260
 And once we have some idea of what languages exist

1:17:23.260 --> 1:17:24.460
 and how a system can learn

1:17:24.460 --> 1:17:26.580
 and what learning itself is in the first place.

1:17:26.580 --> 1:17:31.580
 And so we can begin to realize that our intuitions

1:17:31.900 --> 1:17:34.620
 that we are able to learn about the regularities

1:17:34.620 --> 1:17:36.300
 of the world and minimize surprise

1:17:36.300 --> 1:17:38.900
 and understand the nature of our own agency

1:17:38.900 --> 1:17:40.660
 to some degree of abstraction.

1:17:40.660 --> 1:17:42.140
 That's not an illusion.

1:17:42.140 --> 1:17:44.140
 So it's a useful approximation.

1:17:44.140 --> 1:17:46.860
 Just because we live in a dream world

1:17:46.860 --> 1:17:51.780
 doesn't mean mathematics can't give us a consistent glimpse

1:17:51.780 --> 1:17:54.940
 of physical, of objective reality.

1:17:54.940 --> 1:17:57.340
 We can basically distinguish useful encodings

1:17:57.340 --> 1:17:58.980
 from useless encodings.

1:17:58.980 --> 1:18:03.460
 And when we apply our truth seeking to the world,

1:18:03.460 --> 1:18:05.460
 we know we usually cannot find out

1:18:05.460 --> 1:18:07.460
 whether a certain thing is true.

1:18:07.460 --> 1:18:10.060
 What we typically do is we take the state vector

1:18:10.060 --> 1:18:12.100
 of the universe separated into separate objects

1:18:12.100 --> 1:18:14.420
 that interact with each other through interfaces.

1:18:14.420 --> 1:18:16.180
 And this distinction that we are making

1:18:16.180 --> 1:18:17.420
 is not completely arbitrary.

1:18:17.420 --> 1:18:21.140
 It's done to optimize the compression

1:18:21.140 --> 1:18:23.380
 that we can apply to our models of the universe.

1:18:23.380 --> 1:18:25.660
 So we can predict what's happening

1:18:25.660 --> 1:18:27.300
 with our limited resources.

1:18:27.300 --> 1:18:29.220
 In this sense, it's not arbitrary.

1:18:29.220 --> 1:18:32.020
 But the separation of the world into objects

1:18:32.020 --> 1:18:34.940
 that are somehow discrete and interacting with each other

1:18:34.940 --> 1:18:36.900
 is not the true reality, right?

1:18:36.900 --> 1:18:38.420
 The boundaries between the objects

1:18:38.420 --> 1:18:41.660
 are projected into the world, not arbitrarily projected.

1:18:41.660 --> 1:18:44.020
 But still, it's only an approximation

1:18:44.020 --> 1:18:46.460
 of what's actually the case.

1:18:46.460 --> 1:18:48.980
 And we sometimes notice that we run into contradictions

1:18:48.980 --> 1:18:50.980
 when we try to understand high level things

1:18:50.980 --> 1:18:53.100
 like economic aspects of the world

1:18:53.100 --> 1:18:56.980
 and so on, or political aspects, or psychological aspects

1:18:56.980 --> 1:18:58.300
 where we make simplifications.

1:18:58.300 --> 1:19:00.780
 And the objects that we are using to separate the world

1:19:00.780 --> 1:19:03.100
 are just one of many possible projections

1:19:03.100 --> 1:19:04.820
 of what's going on.

1:19:04.820 --> 1:19:07.180
 So it's not, in this postmodernist sense,

1:19:07.180 --> 1:19:09.260
 completely arbitrary, and you're free to pick

1:19:09.260 --> 1:19:11.100
 what you want or dismiss what you don't like

1:19:11.100 --> 1:19:12.260
 because it's all stories.

1:19:12.260 --> 1:19:13.660
 No, that's not true.

1:19:13.660 --> 1:19:15.380
 You have to show for every model

1:19:15.380 --> 1:19:17.340
 of how well it predicts the world.

1:19:17.340 --> 1:19:19.220
 So the confidence that you should have

1:19:19.220 --> 1:19:21.020
 in the entities of your models

1:19:21.020 --> 1:19:23.420
 should correspond to the evidence that you have.

1:19:24.460 --> 1:19:26.380
 Can I ask you on a small tangent

1:19:27.660 --> 1:19:32.660
 to talk about your favorite set of ideas and people,

1:19:32.660 --> 1:19:34.220
 which is postmodernism.

1:19:35.180 --> 1:19:36.020
 What?

1:19:37.900 --> 1:19:39.980
 What is postmodernism?

1:19:39.980 --> 1:19:40.980
 How would you define it?

1:19:40.980 --> 1:19:45.980
 And why to you is it not a useful framework of thought?

1:19:48.860 --> 1:19:52.340
 Postmodernism is something that I'm really not an expert on.

1:19:52.340 --> 1:19:57.340
 And postmodernism is a set of philosophical ideas

1:19:57.340 --> 1:19:58.980
 that is difficult to lump together,

1:19:58.980 --> 1:20:01.980
 that is characterized by some useful thinkers,

1:20:01.980 --> 1:20:04.180
 some of them poststructuralists and so on.

1:20:04.180 --> 1:20:05.740
 And I'm mostly not interested in it

1:20:05.740 --> 1:20:08.660
 because I think that it's not leading me anywhere

1:20:08.660 --> 1:20:11.340
 that I find particularly useful.

1:20:11.340 --> 1:20:13.820
 It's mostly, I think, born out of the insight

1:20:13.820 --> 1:20:17.380
 that the ontologies that we impose on the world

1:20:17.380 --> 1:20:18.780
 are not literally true.

1:20:18.780 --> 1:20:20.980
 And that we can often get to a different interpretation

1:20:20.980 --> 1:20:22.780
 by the world by using a different ontology

1:20:22.780 --> 1:20:25.060
 that is different separation of the world

1:20:25.060 --> 1:20:26.540
 into interacting objects.

1:20:26.540 --> 1:20:30.860
 But the idea that this makes the world a set of stories

1:20:30.860 --> 1:20:33.180
 that are arbitrary, I think, is wrong.

1:20:33.180 --> 1:20:37.540
 And the people that are engaging in this type of philosophy

1:20:37.540 --> 1:20:40.900
 are working in an area that I largely don't find productive.

1:20:40.900 --> 1:20:43.060
 There's nothing useful coming out of this.

1:20:43.060 --> 1:20:45.060
 So this idea that truth is relative

1:20:45.060 --> 1:20:46.980
 is not something that has, in some sense,

1:20:46.980 --> 1:20:49.620
 informed physics or theory of relativity.

1:20:49.620 --> 1:20:51.540
 And there is no feedback between those.

1:20:51.540 --> 1:20:54.020
 There is no meaningful information

1:20:54.020 --> 1:20:56.860
 of this type of philosophy on the sciences

1:20:56.860 --> 1:20:59.340
 or on engineering or in politics.

1:20:59.340 --> 1:21:04.820
 But there is a very strong information on ideology

1:21:04.820 --> 1:21:07.620
 because it basically has become an ideology

1:21:07.620 --> 1:21:11.100
 that is justifying itself by the notion

1:21:11.100 --> 1:21:13.420
 that truth is a relative concept.

1:21:13.420 --> 1:21:15.620
 And it's not being used in such a way

1:21:15.620 --> 1:21:18.540
 that the philosophers or sociologists

1:21:18.540 --> 1:21:20.340
 that take up these ideas say,

1:21:20.340 --> 1:21:24.140
 oh, I should doubt my own ideas because maybe my separation of the world

1:21:24.140 --> 1:21:25.740
 into objects is not completely valid.

1:21:25.740 --> 1:21:27.580
 And I should maybe use a different one

1:21:27.580 --> 1:21:30.460
 and be open to a pluralism of ideas.

1:21:30.460 --> 1:21:34.300
 But it mostly exists to dismiss the ideas of other people.

1:21:34.300 --> 1:21:37.540
 It becomes, yeah, it becomes a political weapon of sorts

1:21:37.540 --> 1:21:39.220
 to achieve power.

1:21:39.220 --> 1:21:42.580
 Basically, there's nothing wrong, I think,

1:21:42.580 --> 1:21:46.060
 with developing a philosophy around this.

1:21:46.060 --> 1:21:49.180
 But to develop a philosophy around this,

1:21:49.180 --> 1:21:51.820
 to develop norms around the idea

1:21:51.820 --> 1:21:54.940
 that truth is something that is completely negotiable,

1:21:54.940 --> 1:21:57.860
 is incompatible with the scientific project.

1:21:57.860 --> 1:22:02.140
 And I think if the academia has no defense

1:22:02.140 --> 1:22:06.740
 against the ideological parts of the postmodernist movement,

1:22:06.740 --> 1:22:07.860
 it's doomed.

1:22:07.860 --> 1:22:11.740
 Right, you have to acknowledge the ideological part

1:22:11.740 --> 1:22:15.260
 of any movement, actually, including postmodernism.

1:22:15.260 --> 1:22:17.500
 Well, the question is what an ideology is.

1:22:17.500 --> 1:22:21.060
 And to me, an ideology is basically a viral memeplex

1:22:21.060 --> 1:22:25.980
 that is changing your mind in such a way that reality gets warped.

1:22:25.980 --> 1:22:28.180
 It gets warped in such a way that you're being cut off

1:22:28.180 --> 1:22:29.540
 from the rest of human thought space.

1:22:29.540 --> 1:22:33.420
 And you cannot consider things outside of the range of ideas

1:22:33.420 --> 1:22:35.780
 of your own ideology as possibly true.

1:22:35.780 --> 1:22:38.380
 Right, so, I mean, there's certain properties to an ideology

1:22:38.380 --> 1:22:39.340
 that make it harmful.

1:22:39.340 --> 1:22:44.060
 One of them is that dogmatism of just certainty,

1:22:44.060 --> 1:22:46.660
 dogged certainty in that you're right,

1:22:46.660 --> 1:22:48.780
 you have the truth, and nobody else does.

1:22:48.780 --> 1:22:50.220
 Yeah, but what is creating the certainty?

1:22:50.220 --> 1:22:53.060
 It's very interesting to look at the type of model

1:22:53.060 --> 1:22:54.100
 that is being produced.

1:22:54.100 --> 1:22:57.500
 Is it basically just a strong prior, and you tell people,

1:22:57.500 --> 1:22:59.980
 oh, this idea that you consider to be very true,

1:22:59.980 --> 1:23:02.220
 the evidence for this is actually just much weaker

1:23:02.220 --> 1:23:04.380
 than you thought, and look, here are some studies.

1:23:04.380 --> 1:23:06.100
 No, this is not how it works.

1:23:06.100 --> 1:23:09.260
 It's usually normative, which means some thoughts

1:23:09.260 --> 1:23:13.780
 are unthinkable because they would change your identity

1:23:13.780 --> 1:23:17.100
 into something that is no longer acceptable.

1:23:17.100 --> 1:23:20.100
 And this cuts you off from considering an alternative.

1:23:20.100 --> 1:23:23.220
 And many de facto religions use this trick

1:23:23.220 --> 1:23:25.700
 to lock people into a certain mode of thought,

1:23:25.700 --> 1:23:27.700
 and this removes agency over your own thoughts.

1:23:27.700 --> 1:23:28.660
 And it's very ugly to me.

1:23:28.660 --> 1:23:32.580
 It's basically not just a process of domestication,

1:23:32.580 --> 1:23:35.180
 but it's actually an intellectual castration

1:23:35.180 --> 1:23:36.220
 that happens.

1:23:36.220 --> 1:23:39.140
 It's an inability to think creatively

1:23:39.140 --> 1:23:40.820
 and to bring forth new thoughts.

1:23:40.820 --> 1:23:45.820
 I can ask you about substances, chemical substances

1:23:48.300 --> 1:23:53.140
 that affect the video game, the dream world.

1:23:53.140 --> 1:23:57.140
 So psychedelics that increasingly have been getting

1:23:57.140 --> 1:23:58.820
 a lot of research done on them.

1:23:58.820 --> 1:24:02.620
 So in general, psychedelics, psilocybin, MDMA,

1:24:02.620 --> 1:24:06.300
 but also a really interesting one, the big one, which is DMT.

1:24:06.300 --> 1:24:10.820
 What and where are the places that these substances

1:24:10.820 --> 1:24:15.380
 take the mind that is operating in the dream world?

1:24:16.620 --> 1:24:20.340
 Do you have an interesting sense how this throws a wrinkle

1:24:20.340 --> 1:24:22.260
 into the prediction model?

1:24:22.260 --> 1:24:24.500
 Is it just some weird little quirk

1:24:24.500 --> 1:24:27.820
 or is there some fundamental expansion

1:24:27.820 --> 1:24:28.940
 of the mind going on?

1:24:31.700 --> 1:24:34.140
 I suspect that a way to look at psychedelics

1:24:34.140 --> 1:24:36.420
 is that they induce particular types

1:24:36.420 --> 1:24:38.540
 of lucid dreaming states.

1:24:38.540 --> 1:24:41.620
 So it's a state in which certain connections

1:24:41.620 --> 1:24:43.820
 are being severed in your mind.

1:24:43.820 --> 1:24:45.340
 They're no longer active.

1:24:45.340 --> 1:24:48.860
 Your mind basically gets free to move in a certain direction

1:24:48.860 --> 1:24:51.060
 because some inhibition, some particular inhibition

1:24:51.060 --> 1:24:52.740
 doesn't work anymore.

1:24:52.740 --> 1:24:55.340
 And as a result, you might stop having a self

1:24:55.340 --> 1:25:00.340
 or you might stop perceiving the world as three dimensional.

1:25:00.340 --> 1:25:04.500
 And you can explore that state.

1:25:04.500 --> 1:25:06.780
 And I suppose that for every state

1:25:06.780 --> 1:25:08.300
 that can be induced with psychedelics,

1:25:08.300 --> 1:25:10.980
 there are people that are naturally in that state.

1:25:10.980 --> 1:25:13.340
 So sometimes psychedelics to shift you

1:25:13.340 --> 1:25:15.860
 through a range of possible mental states.

1:25:15.860 --> 1:25:17.820
 And they can also shift you out of the range

1:25:17.820 --> 1:25:19.100
 of permissible mental states

1:25:19.100 --> 1:25:22.620
 that is where you can make predictive models of reality.

1:25:22.620 --> 1:25:26.980
 And what I observe in people that use psychedelics a lot

1:25:26.980 --> 1:25:29.580
 is that they tend to be overfitting.

1:25:29.580 --> 1:25:34.540
 Overfitting means that you are using more bits

1:25:34.540 --> 1:25:38.060
 for modeling the dynamics of a function than you should.

1:25:38.060 --> 1:25:40.220
 And so you can fit your curve

1:25:40.220 --> 1:25:42.780
 to extremely detailed things in the past,

1:25:42.780 --> 1:25:45.860
 but this model is no longer predictive for the future.

1:25:45.860 --> 1:25:48.460
 What is it about psychedelics that forces that?

1:25:49.660 --> 1:25:51.060
 I thought it would be the opposite.

1:25:51.060 --> 1:25:54.860
 I thought that it's a good mechanism

1:25:54.860 --> 1:25:59.300
 for generalization, for regularization.

1:25:59.300 --> 1:26:03.220
 So it feels like psychedelics expansion of the mind,

1:26:03.220 --> 1:26:04.820
 like taking you outside of,

1:26:04.820 --> 1:26:08.820
 like forcing your model to be non predictive

1:26:08.820 --> 1:26:09.780
 is a good thing.

1:26:11.180 --> 1:26:14.340
 Meaning like, it's almost like, okay,

1:26:14.340 --> 1:26:16.700
 what I would say psychedelics are akin to

1:26:16.700 --> 1:26:19.820
 is traveling to a totally different environment.

1:26:19.820 --> 1:26:21.980
 Like going, if you've never been to like India

1:26:21.980 --> 1:26:24.220
 or something like that from the United States,

1:26:24.220 --> 1:26:26.180
 very different set of people, different culture,

1:26:26.180 --> 1:26:30.340
 different food, different roads and values

1:26:30.340 --> 1:26:31.420
 and all those kinds of things.

1:26:31.420 --> 1:26:33.540
 Yeah, so psychedelics can, for instance,

1:26:33.540 --> 1:26:37.820
 teleport people into a universe that is hyperbolic,

1:26:37.820 --> 1:26:41.300
 which means that if you imagine a room that you're in,

1:26:41.300 --> 1:26:43.580
 you can turn around 360 degrees

1:26:43.580 --> 1:26:44.660
 and you didn't go full circle.

1:26:44.660 --> 1:26:47.180
 You need to go 720 degrees to go full circle.

1:26:47.180 --> 1:26:48.020
 Exactly.

1:26:48.020 --> 1:26:50.820
 So the things that people learn in that state

1:26:50.820 --> 1:26:52.180
 cannot be easily transferred

1:26:52.180 --> 1:26:54.260
 in this universe that we are in.

1:26:54.260 --> 1:26:56.420
 It could be that if they're able to abstract

1:26:56.420 --> 1:26:58.260
 and understand what happened to them,

1:26:58.260 --> 1:27:00.300
 that they understand that some part

1:27:00.300 --> 1:27:03.500
 of their spatial cognition has been desynchronized

1:27:03.500 --> 1:27:05.660
 and has found a different synchronization.

1:27:05.660 --> 1:27:06.900
 And this different synchronization

1:27:06.900 --> 1:27:08.620
 happens to be a hyperbolic one, right?

1:27:08.620 --> 1:27:10.980
 So you learn something interesting about your brain.

1:27:10.980 --> 1:27:13.140
 It's difficult to understand what exactly happened,

1:27:13.140 --> 1:27:14.580
 but we get a pretty good idea

1:27:14.580 --> 1:27:17.700
 once we understand how the brain is representing geometry.

1:27:17.700 --> 1:27:20.180
 Yeah, but doesn't it give you a fresh perspective

1:27:20.180 --> 1:27:26.060
 on the physical reality?

1:27:26.060 --> 1:27:27.780
 Who's making that sound?

1:27:27.780 --> 1:27:30.980
 Is it inside my head or is it external?

1:27:30.980 --> 1:27:33.180
 Well, there is no sound outside of your mind,

1:27:33.180 --> 1:27:39.660
 but it's making sense of phenomenon physics.

1:27:39.660 --> 1:27:44.780
 Yeah, in the physical reality, there's sound waves

1:27:44.780 --> 1:27:45.860
 traveling through air.

1:27:45.860 --> 1:27:47.020
 Okay.

1:27:47.020 --> 1:27:48.580
 That's our model of what happened.

1:27:48.580 --> 1:27:53.380
 That's our model of what happened, right.

1:27:53.380 --> 1:27:57.220
 Doesn't Psychedelics give you a fresh perspective

1:27:57.220 --> 1:27:59.100
 on this physical reality?

1:27:59.100 --> 1:28:05.980
 Like, not this physical reality, but this more...

1:28:05.980 --> 1:28:09.780
 What do you call the dream world that's mapped directly to...

1:28:09.780 --> 1:28:11.580
 The purpose of dreaming at night, I think,

1:28:11.580 --> 1:28:13.660
 is data augmentation.

1:28:13.660 --> 1:28:14.900
 Exactly.

1:28:14.900 --> 1:28:16.300
 So that's very different.

1:28:16.300 --> 1:28:18.780
 That's very similar to Psychedelics.

1:28:18.780 --> 1:28:21.660
 It's changed parameters about the things that you have learned.

1:28:21.660 --> 1:28:24.140
 And, for instance, when you are young,

1:28:24.140 --> 1:28:26.060
 you have seen things from certain perspectives,

1:28:26.060 --> 1:28:27.300
 but not from others.

1:28:27.300 --> 1:28:30.180
 So your brain is generating new perspectives of objects

1:28:30.180 --> 1:28:31.540
 that you already know,

1:28:31.540 --> 1:28:34.100
 which means you can learn to recognize them later

1:28:34.100 --> 1:28:35.180
 from different perspectives.

1:28:35.180 --> 1:28:37.660
 And I suspect that's the reason that many of us

1:28:37.660 --> 1:28:39.700
 remember to have flying dreams as children,

1:28:39.700 --> 1:28:41.700
 because it's just different perspectives of the world

1:28:41.700 --> 1:28:43.020
 that you already know,

1:28:43.020 --> 1:28:46.540
 and that it starts to generate these different

1:28:46.540 --> 1:28:47.860
 perspective changes,

1:28:47.860 --> 1:28:50.540
 and then it fluidly turns this into a flying dream

1:28:50.540 --> 1:28:52.260
 to make sense of what's happening, right?

1:28:52.260 --> 1:28:53.620
 So you fill in the gaps,

1:28:53.620 --> 1:28:55.860
 and suddenly you see yourself flying.

1:28:55.860 --> 1:28:58.820
 And similar things can happen with semantic relationships.

1:28:58.820 --> 1:29:00.580
 So it's not just spatial relationships,

1:29:00.580 --> 1:29:03.420
 but it can also be the relationships between ideas

1:29:03.420 --> 1:29:05.180
 that are being changed.

1:29:05.180 --> 1:29:08.140
 And it seems that the mechanisms that make that happen

1:29:08.140 --> 1:29:12.060
 during dreaming are interacting

1:29:12.060 --> 1:29:14.300
 with these same receptors

1:29:14.300 --> 1:29:17.220
 that are being stimulated by psychedelics.

1:29:17.220 --> 1:29:19.780
 So I suspect that there is a thing

1:29:19.780 --> 1:29:22.020
 that I haven't read really about.

1:29:22.020 --> 1:29:24.380
 The way in which dreams are induced in the brain

1:29:24.380 --> 1:29:28.500
 is not just that the activity of the brain gets tuned down

1:29:28.500 --> 1:29:30.620
 because your eyes are closed

1:29:30.620 --> 1:29:33.980
 and you no longer get enough data from your eyes,

1:29:33.980 --> 1:29:37.180
 but there is a particular type of neurotransmitter

1:29:37.180 --> 1:29:40.140
 that is saturating your brain during these phases,

1:29:40.140 --> 1:29:42.980
 during the REM phases, and you produce

1:29:42.980 --> 1:29:44.740
 controlled hallucinations.

1:29:44.740 --> 1:29:48.700
 And psychedelics are linking into these mechanisms,

1:29:48.700 --> 1:29:49.860
 I suspect.

1:29:49.860 --> 1:29:54.060
 So isn't that another trickier form of data augmentation?

1:29:54.060 --> 1:29:57.740
 Yes, but it's also data augmentation

1:29:57.740 --> 1:29:59.860
 that can happen outside of the specification

1:29:59.860 --> 1:30:00.940
 that your brain is tuned to.

1:30:00.940 --> 1:30:03.420
 So basically people are overclocking their brains

1:30:03.420 --> 1:30:05.780
 and that produces states

1:30:05.780 --> 1:30:09.260
 that are subjectively extremely interesting.

1:30:09.260 --> 1:30:10.540
 Yeah, I just.

1:30:10.540 --> 1:30:12.860
 But from the outside, very suspicious.

1:30:12.860 --> 1:30:15.660
 So I think I'm over applying the metaphor

1:30:15.660 --> 1:30:17.860
 of a neural network in my own mind,

1:30:17.860 --> 1:30:22.460
 which I just think that doesn't lead to overfitting, right?

1:30:22.460 --> 1:30:26.380
 But you were just sort of anecdotally saying

1:30:26.380 --> 1:30:28.660
 my experiences with people that have done psychedelics

1:30:28.660 --> 1:30:30.460
 are that kind of quality.

1:30:30.460 --> 1:30:31.580
 I think it typically happens.

1:30:31.580 --> 1:30:34.420
 So if you look at people like Timothy Leary,

1:30:34.420 --> 1:30:36.700
 and he has written beautiful manifestos

1:30:36.700 --> 1:30:40.220
 about the effect of LSD on people.

1:30:40.220 --> 1:30:42.820
 He genuinely believed, he writes in these manifestos,

1:30:42.820 --> 1:30:44.860
 that in the future, science and art

1:30:44.860 --> 1:30:46.300
 will only be done on psychedelics

1:30:46.300 --> 1:30:49.020
 because it's so much more efficient and so much better.

1:30:49.020 --> 1:30:52.660
 And he gave LSD to children in this community

1:30:52.660 --> 1:30:55.780
 of a few thousand people that he had near San Francisco.

1:30:55.780 --> 1:31:00.540
 And basically he was losing touch with reality.

1:31:00.540 --> 1:31:02.220
 He did not understand the effects

1:31:02.220 --> 1:31:04.260
 that the things that he was doing

1:31:04.260 --> 1:31:06.620
 would have on the reception of psychedelics

1:31:06.620 --> 1:31:09.900
 by society because he was unable to think critically

1:31:09.900 --> 1:31:10.740
 about what happened.

1:31:10.740 --> 1:31:13.500
 What happened was that he got in a euphoric state,

1:31:13.500 --> 1:31:16.620
 that euphoric state happened because he was overfitting.

1:31:16.620 --> 1:31:19.460
 He was taking this sense of euphoria

1:31:19.460 --> 1:31:21.500
 and translating it into a model

1:31:21.500 --> 1:31:23.660
 of actual success in the world, right?

1:31:23.660 --> 1:31:25.500
 He was feeling better.

1:31:25.500 --> 1:31:26.940
 Limitations had disappeared,

1:31:26.940 --> 1:31:29.580
 that he experienced to be existing,

1:31:29.580 --> 1:31:30.740
 but he didn't get superpowers.

1:31:30.740 --> 1:31:33.860
 I understand what you mean by overfitting now.

1:31:33.860 --> 1:31:36.020
 There's a lot of interpretation to the term

1:31:36.020 --> 1:31:38.660
 overfitting in this case, but I got you.

1:31:38.660 --> 1:31:42.740
 So he was getting positive rewards

1:31:42.740 --> 1:31:44.220
 from a lot of actions that he shouldn't have been doing.

1:31:44.220 --> 1:31:45.060
 Yeah, but not just this.

1:31:45.060 --> 1:31:46.620
 So if you take, for instance, John Lilly,

1:31:46.620 --> 1:31:51.620
 who was studying dolphin languages and aliens and so on,

1:31:52.140 --> 1:31:54.940
 a lot of people that use psychedelics became very loopy.

1:31:55.900 --> 1:31:58.700
 And the typical thing that you notice

1:31:58.700 --> 1:32:00.940
 when people are on psychedelics is that they are in a state

1:32:00.940 --> 1:32:03.660
 where they feel that everything can be explained now.

1:32:03.660 --> 1:32:06.620
 Everything is clear, everything is obvious.

1:32:06.620 --> 1:32:09.660
 And sometimes they have indeed discovered

1:32:09.660 --> 1:32:12.060
 a useful connection, but not always.

1:32:12.060 --> 1:32:15.380
 Very often these connections are overinterpretations.

1:32:15.380 --> 1:32:17.740
 I wonder, you know, there's a question

1:32:17.740 --> 1:32:21.060
 of correlation versus causation.

1:32:21.060 --> 1:32:23.340
 And also I wonder if it's the psychedelics

1:32:23.340 --> 1:32:27.100
 or if it's more the social, like being the outsider

1:32:28.580 --> 1:32:31.140
 and having a strong community of outside

1:32:31.140 --> 1:32:34.300
 and having a leadership position in an outsider cult

1:32:34.300 --> 1:32:37.420
 like community that could have a much stronger effect

1:32:37.420 --> 1:32:39.940
 of overfitting than do psychedelics themselves,

1:32:39.940 --> 1:32:43.340
 the actual substances, because it's a counterculture thing.

1:32:43.340 --> 1:32:46.540
 So it could be that as opposed to the actual substance.

1:32:46.540 --> 1:32:49.700
 If you're a boring person who wears a suit and tie

1:32:49.700 --> 1:32:53.220
 and works at a bank and takes psychedelics,

1:32:53.220 --> 1:32:55.140
 that could be a very different effect

1:32:55.140 --> 1:32:57.820
 of psychedelics on your mind.

1:32:57.820 --> 1:32:59.660
 I'm just sort of raising the point

1:32:59.660 --> 1:33:02.860
 that the people you referenced are already weirdos.

1:33:02.860 --> 1:33:04.180
 I'm not sure exactly.

1:33:04.180 --> 1:33:05.220
 No, not necessarily.

1:33:05.220 --> 1:33:07.540
 A lot of the people that tell me

1:33:07.540 --> 1:33:10.980
 that they use psychedelics in a useful way

1:33:10.980 --> 1:33:14.580
 started out as squares and were liberating themselves

1:33:14.580 --> 1:33:16.060
 because they were stuck.

1:33:16.060 --> 1:33:17.980
 They were basically stuck in local optimum

1:33:17.980 --> 1:33:20.980
 of their own self model, of their relationship to the world.

1:33:20.980 --> 1:33:23.180
 And suddenly they had data augmentation.

1:33:23.180 --> 1:33:26.740
 They basically saw and experienced a space of possibilities.

1:33:26.740 --> 1:33:29.540
 They experienced what it would be like to be another person.

1:33:29.540 --> 1:33:32.260
 And they took important lessons

1:33:32.260 --> 1:33:33.780
 from that experience back home.

1:33:36.660 --> 1:33:40.660
 Yeah, I mean, I love the metaphor of data augmentation

1:33:40.660 --> 1:33:44.900
 because that's been the primary driver

1:33:44.900 --> 1:33:48.900
 of self supervised learning in the computer vision domain

1:33:48.900 --> 1:33:50.100
 is data augmentation.

1:33:50.100 --> 1:33:53.100
 So it's funny to think of data augmentation,

1:33:53.100 --> 1:33:58.100
 like chemically induced data augmentation in the human mind.

1:33:58.100 --> 1:34:02.100
 There's also a very interesting effect that I noticed.

1:34:02.100 --> 1:34:06.100
 I know several people who are sphere to me

1:34:06.100 --> 1:34:09.780
 that LSD has cured their migraines.

1:34:09.780 --> 1:34:13.060
 So severe cluster headaches or migraines

1:34:13.060 --> 1:34:15.900
 that didn't respond to standard medication

1:34:15.900 --> 1:34:18.220
 that disappeared after a single dose.

1:34:18.220 --> 1:34:20.820
 And I don't recommend anybody doing this,

1:34:20.820 --> 1:34:23.260
 especially not in the US where it's illegal.

1:34:23.260 --> 1:34:26.340
 And there are no studies on this for that reason.

1:34:26.340 --> 1:34:28.900
 But it seems that anecdotally

1:34:28.900 --> 1:34:33.420
 that it basically can reset the serotonergic system.

1:34:33.420 --> 1:34:36.380
 So it's basically pushing them

1:34:36.380 --> 1:34:38.220
 outside of their normal boundaries.

1:34:38.220 --> 1:34:41.020
 And as a result, it needs to find a new equilibrium.

1:34:41.020 --> 1:34:43.300
 And in some people that equilibrium is better,

1:34:43.300 --> 1:34:46.260
 but it also follows that in other people it might be worse.

1:34:46.260 --> 1:34:49.500
 So if you have a brain that is already teetering

1:34:49.500 --> 1:34:51.980
 on the boundary to psychosis,

1:34:51.980 --> 1:34:54.740
 it can be permanently pushed over that boundary.

1:34:54.740 --> 1:34:56.540
 Well, that's why you have to do good science,

1:34:56.540 --> 1:34:58.340
 which they're starting to do on all these different

1:34:58.340 --> 1:34:59.940
 substances of how well it actually works

1:34:59.940 --> 1:35:02.660
 for the different conditions like MDMA seems to help

1:35:02.660 --> 1:35:05.580
 with PTSD, same with psilocybin.

1:35:05.580 --> 1:35:08.340
 You need to do good science,

1:35:08.340 --> 1:35:10.860
 meaning large studies of large N.

1:35:10.860 --> 1:35:14.060
 Yeah, so based on the existing studies of MDMA,

1:35:14.060 --> 1:35:17.460
 it seems that if you look at Rick Doblin's work

1:35:17.460 --> 1:35:20.780
 and what he has published about this and talks about,

1:35:20.780 --> 1:35:24.180
 MDMA seems to be a psychologically relatively safe drug.

1:35:24.180 --> 1:35:26.740
 But it's physiologically not very safe.

1:35:26.740 --> 1:35:30.060
 That is, there is neurotoxicity

1:35:30.060 --> 1:35:31.820
 if you would use a too large dose.

1:35:31.820 --> 1:35:34.420
 And if you combine this with alcohol,

1:35:34.420 --> 1:35:37.540
 which a lot of kids do in party settings during raves

1:35:37.540 --> 1:35:40.260
 and so on, it's very hepatotoxic.

1:35:40.260 --> 1:35:42.220
 So basically you can kill your liver.

1:35:42.220 --> 1:35:45.340
 And this means that it's probably something that is best

1:35:45.340 --> 1:35:48.340
 and most productively used in a clinical setting

1:35:48.340 --> 1:35:50.020
 by people who really know what they're doing.

1:35:50.020 --> 1:35:53.580
 And I suspect that's also true for the other psychedelics

1:35:53.580 --> 1:35:56.620
 that is while the other psychedelics are probably not

1:35:56.620 --> 1:35:59.460
 as toxic as say alcohol,

1:35:59.460 --> 1:36:02.220
 the effects on the psyche can be much more profound

1:36:02.220 --> 1:36:03.460
 and lasting.

1:36:03.460 --> 1:36:05.940
 Yeah, well, as far as I know psilocybin,

1:36:05.940 --> 1:36:09.020
 so mushrooms, magic mushrooms,

1:36:09.020 --> 1:36:11.780
 as far as I know in terms of the studies they're running,

1:36:11.780 --> 1:36:15.060
 I think have no, like they're allowed to do

1:36:15.060 --> 1:36:17.060
 what they're calling heroic doses.

1:36:17.060 --> 1:36:18.980
 So that one does not have a toxicity.

1:36:18.980 --> 1:36:21.700
 So they could do like huge doses in a clinical setting

1:36:21.700 --> 1:36:23.620
 when they're doing study on psilocybin,

1:36:23.620 --> 1:36:25.140
 which is kind of fun.

1:36:25.140 --> 1:36:27.100
 Yeah, it seems that most of the psychedelics

1:36:27.100 --> 1:36:29.300
 work in extremely small doses,

1:36:29.300 --> 1:36:32.180
 which means that the effect on the rest of the body

1:36:32.180 --> 1:36:33.660
 is relatively low.

1:36:33.660 --> 1:36:36.180
 And MDMA is probably the exception.

1:36:36.180 --> 1:36:38.300
 Maybe ketamine can be dangerous in larger doses

1:36:38.300 --> 1:36:41.260
 because it can depress breathing and so on.

1:36:41.260 --> 1:36:45.940
 But the LSD and psilocybin work in very, very small doses,

1:36:45.940 --> 1:36:47.820
 at least the active part of them,

1:36:47.820 --> 1:36:50.580
 of psilocybin LSD is only the active part.

1:36:50.580 --> 1:36:54.100
 And the, but the effect that it can have

1:36:54.100 --> 1:36:57.060
 on your mental wiring can be very dangerous, I think.

1:36:57.940 --> 1:36:59.620
 Let's talk about AI a little bit.

1:37:00.540 --> 1:37:05.300
 What are your thoughts about GPT3 and language models

1:37:05.300 --> 1:37:07.220
 trained with self supervised learning?

1:37:09.980 --> 1:37:11.420
 It came out quite a bit ago,

1:37:11.420 --> 1:37:13.180
 but I wanted to get your thoughts on it.

1:37:13.180 --> 1:37:14.580
 Yeah.

1:37:14.580 --> 1:37:16.900
 In the nineties, I was in New Zealand

1:37:16.900 --> 1:37:21.140
 and I had an amazing professor, Ian Witten,

1:37:21.140 --> 1:37:25.220
 who realized I was bored in class and put me in his lab.

1:37:25.220 --> 1:37:28.780
 And he gave me the task to discover grammatical structure

1:37:28.780 --> 1:37:30.100
 in an unknown language.

1:37:31.420 --> 1:37:33.740
 And the unknown language that I picked was English

1:37:33.740 --> 1:37:35.100
 because it was the easiest one

1:37:35.100 --> 1:37:37.980
 to find a corpus for construct one.

1:37:37.980 --> 1:37:41.980
 And he gave me the largest computer at the whole university.

1:37:41.980 --> 1:37:44.140
 It had two gigabytes of RAM, which was amazing.

1:37:44.140 --> 1:37:45.380
 And I wrote everything in C

1:37:45.380 --> 1:37:47.740
 with some in memory compression to do statistics

1:37:47.740 --> 1:37:49.340
 over the language.

1:37:49.340 --> 1:37:53.900
 And I first would create a dictionary of all the words,

1:37:53.900 --> 1:37:57.300
 which basically tokenizes everything and compresses things

1:37:57.300 --> 1:37:58.820
 so that I don't need to store the whole word,

1:37:58.820 --> 1:38:02.300
 but just a code for every word.

1:38:02.300 --> 1:38:05.900
 And then I was taking this all apart in sentences

1:38:05.900 --> 1:38:09.140
 and I was trying to find all the relationships

1:38:09.140 --> 1:38:10.860
 between all the words in the sentences

1:38:10.860 --> 1:38:12.940
 and do statistics over them.

1:38:12.940 --> 1:38:15.180
 And that proved to be impossible

1:38:15.180 --> 1:38:18.020
 because the complexity is just too large.

1:38:18.020 --> 1:38:20.460
 So if you want to discover the relationship

1:38:20.460 --> 1:38:21.860
 between an article and a noun,

1:38:21.860 --> 1:38:23.860
 and there are three adjectives in between,

1:38:23.860 --> 1:38:25.420
 you cannot do ngram statistics

1:38:25.420 --> 1:38:28.060
 and look at all the possibilities that can exist,

1:38:28.060 --> 1:38:30.740
 at least not with the resources that we had back then.

1:38:30.740 --> 1:38:33.300
 So I realized I need to make some statistics

1:38:33.300 --> 1:38:35.220
 over what I need to make statistics over.

1:38:35.220 --> 1:38:38.620
 So I wrote something that was pretty much a hack

1:38:38.620 --> 1:38:42.380
 that did this for at least first order relationships.

1:38:42.380 --> 1:38:45.100
 And I came up with some kind of mutual information graph

1:38:45.100 --> 1:38:48.380
 that was indeed discovering something that looks exactly

1:38:48.380 --> 1:38:50.500
 like the grammatical structure of the sentence,

1:38:50.500 --> 1:38:52.660
 just by trying to encode the sentence

1:38:52.660 --> 1:38:54.740
 in such a way that the words would be written

1:38:54.740 --> 1:38:58.100
 in the optimal order inside of the model.

1:38:58.100 --> 1:39:02.140
 And what I also found is that if we would be able

1:39:02.140 --> 1:39:03.820
 to increase the resolution of that

1:39:03.820 --> 1:39:06.620
 and not just use this model

1:39:06.620 --> 1:39:09.060
 to reproduce grammatically correct sentences,

1:39:09.060 --> 1:39:09.980
 we would also be able

1:39:09.980 --> 1:39:12.020
 to correct stylistically correct sentences

1:39:12.020 --> 1:39:14.580
 by just having more bits in these relationships.

1:39:14.580 --> 1:39:16.300
 And if we wanted to have meaning,

1:39:16.300 --> 1:39:18.740
 we would have to go much higher order.

1:39:18.740 --> 1:39:21.460
 And I didn't know how to make higher order models back then

1:39:21.460 --> 1:39:23.860
 without spending way more years in research

1:39:23.860 --> 1:39:25.580
 on how to make the statistics

1:39:25.580 --> 1:39:27.700
 over what we need to make statistics over.

1:39:28.660 --> 1:39:31.540
 And this thing that we cannot look at the relationships

1:39:31.540 --> 1:39:34.020
 between all the bits in your input is being solved

1:39:34.020 --> 1:39:35.780
 in different domains in different ways.

1:39:35.780 --> 1:39:39.380
 So in computer graphics, computer vision,

1:39:39.380 --> 1:39:41.380
 standard methods for many years now

1:39:41.380 --> 1:39:43.620
 is convolutional neural networks.

1:39:43.620 --> 1:39:46.620
 Convolutional neural networks are hierarchies of filters

1:39:46.620 --> 1:39:48.980
 that exploit the fact that neighboring pixels

1:39:48.980 --> 1:39:51.100
 in images are usually semantically related

1:39:51.100 --> 1:39:53.020
 and distance pixels in images

1:39:53.020 --> 1:39:55.500
 are usually not semantically related.

1:39:55.500 --> 1:39:57.700
 So you can just by grouping the pixels

1:39:57.700 --> 1:39:59.100
 that are next to each other,

1:39:59.100 --> 1:40:02.780
 hierarchically together reconstruct the shape of objects.

1:40:02.780 --> 1:40:04.620
 And this is an important prior

1:40:04.620 --> 1:40:06.140
 that we built into these models

1:40:06.140 --> 1:40:08.460
 so they can converge quickly.

1:40:08.460 --> 1:40:09.820
 But this doesn't work in language

1:40:09.820 --> 1:40:12.940
 for the reason that adjacent words are often

1:40:12.940 --> 1:40:14.980
 but not always related and distant words

1:40:14.980 --> 1:40:18.060
 are sometimes related while the words in between are not.

1:40:19.380 --> 1:40:22.660
 So how can you learn the topology of language?

1:40:22.660 --> 1:40:26.460
 And I think for this reason that this difficulty existed,

1:40:26.460 --> 1:40:28.700
 the transformer was invented

1:40:28.700 --> 1:40:32.780
 in natural language processing, not in vision.

1:40:32.780 --> 1:40:34.900
 And what the transformer is doing,

1:40:34.900 --> 1:40:38.420
 it's a hierarchy of layers where every layer learns

1:40:38.420 --> 1:40:40.900
 what to pay attention to in the given context

1:40:40.900 --> 1:40:43.220
 in the previous layer.

1:40:43.220 --> 1:40:45.180
 So what to make the statistics over.

1:40:46.020 --> 1:40:49.980
 And the context is significantly larger

1:40:49.980 --> 1:40:51.540
 than the adjacent word.

1:40:51.540 --> 1:40:55.980
 Yes, so the context that GPT3 has been using,

1:40:55.980 --> 1:40:58.500
 the transformer itself is from 2017

1:40:58.500 --> 1:41:02.180
 and it wasn't using that large of a context.

1:41:02.180 --> 1:41:05.060
 OpenAI has basically scaled up this idea

1:41:05.060 --> 1:41:06.940
 as far as they could at the time.

1:41:06.940 --> 1:41:11.300
 And the context is about 2048 symbols,

1:41:11.300 --> 1:41:12.860
 tokens in the language.

1:41:12.860 --> 1:41:15.060
 These symbols are not characters,

1:41:15.060 --> 1:41:17.020
 but they take the words and project them

1:41:17.020 --> 1:41:20.100
 into a vector space where words

1:41:20.100 --> 1:41:22.020
 that are statistically co occurring a lot

1:41:22.020 --> 1:41:23.220
 are neighbors already.

1:41:23.220 --> 1:41:24.780
 So it's already a simplification

1:41:24.780 --> 1:41:26.580
 of the problem a little bit.

1:41:26.580 --> 1:41:29.260
 And so every word is basically a set of coordinates

1:41:29.260 --> 1:41:31.060
 in a high dimensional space.

1:41:31.060 --> 1:41:33.100
 And then they use some kind of trick

1:41:33.100 --> 1:41:36.340
 to also encode the order of the words in a sentence

1:41:36.340 --> 1:41:37.820
 or in the not just sentence,

1:41:37.820 --> 1:41:41.780
 but 2048 tokens is about a couple of pages of text

1:41:41.780 --> 1:41:43.620
 or two and a half pages of text.

1:41:43.620 --> 1:41:46.860
 And so they managed to do pretty exhaustive statistics

1:41:46.860 --> 1:41:49.140
 over the potential relationships

1:41:49.140 --> 1:41:51.740
 between two pages of text, which is tremendous.

1:41:51.740 --> 1:41:55.020
 I was just using a single sentence back then.

1:41:55.020 --> 1:41:58.780
 And I was only looking for first order relationships.

1:41:58.780 --> 1:42:00.380
 And they were really looking

1:42:00.380 --> 1:42:02.740
 for much, much higher level relationships.

1:42:02.740 --> 1:42:05.300
 And what they discover after they fed this

1:42:05.300 --> 1:42:06.580
 with an enormous amount of training,

1:42:06.580 --> 1:42:08.980
 they are pretty much the written internet

1:42:08.980 --> 1:42:12.140
 or a subset of it that had some quality,

1:42:12.140 --> 1:42:15.180
 but substantial portion of the common core

1:42:15.180 --> 1:42:18.180
 that they're not only able to reproduce style,

1:42:18.180 --> 1:42:19.860
 but they're also able to reproduce

1:42:19.860 --> 1:42:21.660
 some pretty detailed semantics,

1:42:21.660 --> 1:42:24.700
 like being able to add three digit numbers

1:42:24.700 --> 1:42:26.220
 and multiply two digit numbers

1:42:26.220 --> 1:42:28.820
 or to translate between programming languages

1:42:28.820 --> 1:42:30.220
 and things like that.

1:42:30.220 --> 1:42:34.060
 So the results that GPT3 got, I think were amazing.

1:42:34.060 --> 1:42:38.620
 By the way, I actually didn't check carefully.

1:42:38.620 --> 1:42:40.540
 It's funny you just mentioned

1:42:40.540 --> 1:42:42.940
 how you coupled semantics to the multiplication.

1:42:42.940 --> 1:42:46.700
 Is it able to do some basic math on two digit numbers?

1:42:46.700 --> 1:42:47.940
 Yes.

1:42:47.940 --> 1:42:48.820
 Okay, interesting.

1:42:48.820 --> 1:42:53.100
 I thought there's a lot of failure cases.

1:42:53.100 --> 1:42:56.140
 Yeah, it basically fails if you take larger digit numbers.

1:42:56.140 --> 1:42:59.780
 So four digit numbers and so on makes carrying mistakes

1:42:59.780 --> 1:43:00.620
 and so on.

1:43:00.620 --> 1:43:02.580
 And if you take larger numbers,

1:43:02.580 --> 1:43:04.980
 you don't get useful results at all.

1:43:04.980 --> 1:43:09.260
 And this could be an issue of the training set

1:43:09.260 --> 1:43:10.940
 where there are not many examples

1:43:10.940 --> 1:43:13.300
 of successful long form addition

1:43:13.300 --> 1:43:15.300
 and standard human written text.

1:43:15.300 --> 1:43:16.780
 And humans aren't very good

1:43:16.780 --> 1:43:19.460
 at doing three digit numbers either.

1:43:19.460 --> 1:43:22.340
 Yeah, you're not writing a lot about it.

1:43:22.340 --> 1:43:24.740
 And the other thing is that the loss function

1:43:24.740 --> 1:43:27.020
 that is being used is only minimizing surprise.

1:43:27.020 --> 1:43:29.580
 So it's predicting what comes next in the typical text.

1:43:29.580 --> 1:43:32.260
 It's not trying to go for causal closure first

1:43:32.260 --> 1:43:33.100
 as we do.

1:43:33.100 --> 1:43:33.940
 Yeah.

1:43:35.100 --> 1:43:39.620
 But the fact that that kind of prediction works

1:43:39.620 --> 1:43:42.740
 to generate text that's semantically rich

1:43:42.740 --> 1:43:45.020
 and consistent is interesting.

1:43:45.020 --> 1:43:45.860
 Yeah.

1:43:45.860 --> 1:43:47.220
 So yeah, so it's amazing that it's able

1:43:47.220 --> 1:43:50.780
 to generate semantically consistent text.

1:43:50.780 --> 1:43:51.940
 It's not consistent.

1:43:51.940 --> 1:43:54.660
 So the problem is that it loses coherence at some point,

1:43:54.660 --> 1:43:57.140
 but it's also, I think, not correct to say

1:43:57.140 --> 1:44:01.340
 that GPT3 is unable to deal with semantics at all

1:44:01.340 --> 1:44:04.100
 because you ask it to perform certain transformations

1:44:04.100 --> 1:44:07.220
 in text and it performs these transformation in text.

1:44:07.220 --> 1:44:09.220
 And the kind of additions that it's able

1:44:09.220 --> 1:44:12.540
 to perform are transformations in text, right?

1:44:12.540 --> 1:44:15.340
 And there are proper semantics involved.

1:44:15.340 --> 1:44:16.420
 You can also do more.

1:44:16.420 --> 1:44:19.900
 There was a paper that was generating lots

1:44:19.900 --> 1:44:24.180
 and lots of mathematically correct text

1:44:24.180 --> 1:44:26.340
 and was feeding this into a transformer.

1:44:26.340 --> 1:44:29.340
 And as a result, it was able to learn

1:44:29.340 --> 1:44:32.460
 how to do differentiation integration in race

1:44:32.460 --> 1:44:35.100
 that according to the authors, Mathematica could not.

1:44:37.340 --> 1:44:39.860
 To which some of the people in Mathematica responded

1:44:39.860 --> 1:44:42.700
 that they were not using Mathematica in the right way

1:44:42.700 --> 1:44:43.540
 and so on.

1:44:43.540 --> 1:44:46.380
 I have not really followed the resolution of this conflict.

1:44:46.380 --> 1:44:48.700
 This part, as a small tangent,

1:44:48.700 --> 1:44:51.500
 I really don't like in machine learning papers,

1:44:51.500 --> 1:44:56.500
 which they often do anecdotal evidence.

1:44:56.620 --> 1:44:58.300
 They'll find like one example

1:44:58.300 --> 1:45:00.460
 in some kind of specific use of Mathematica

1:45:00.460 --> 1:45:01.940
 and demonstrate, look, here's,

1:45:01.940 --> 1:45:04.140
 they'll show successes and failures,

1:45:04.140 --> 1:45:07.660
 but they won't have a very clear representation

1:45:07.660 --> 1:45:09.380
 of how many cases this actually represents.

1:45:09.380 --> 1:45:11.260
 Yes, but I think as a first paper,

1:45:11.260 --> 1:45:12.660
 this is a pretty good start.

1:45:12.660 --> 1:45:15.460
 And so the take home message, I think,

1:45:15.460 --> 1:45:19.420
 is that the authors could get better results

1:45:19.420 --> 1:45:21.540
 from this in their experiments

1:45:21.540 --> 1:45:23.460
 than they could get from the vein,

1:45:23.460 --> 1:45:25.940
 which they were using computer algebra systems,

1:45:25.940 --> 1:45:29.100
 which means that was not nothing.

1:45:29.100 --> 1:45:32.340
 And it's able to perform substantially better

1:45:32.340 --> 1:45:35.660
 than GPT's V can based on a much larger amount

1:45:35.660 --> 1:45:38.980
 of training data using the same underlying algorithm.

1:45:38.980 --> 1:45:41.300
 Well, let me ask, again,

1:45:41.300 --> 1:45:44.860
 so I'm using your tweets as if this is like Plato, right?

1:45:47.060 --> 1:45:51.780
 As if this is well thought out novels that you've written.

1:45:51.780 --> 1:45:55.820
 You tweeted, GPT4 is listening to us now.

1:45:58.660 --> 1:46:00.300
 This is one way of asking,

1:46:00.300 --> 1:46:04.220
 what are the limitations of GPT3 when it scales?

1:46:04.220 --> 1:46:06.500
 So what do you think will be the capabilities

1:46:06.500 --> 1:46:10.260
 of GPT4, GPT5, and so on?

1:46:10.260 --> 1:46:11.780
 What are the limits of this approach?

1:46:11.780 --> 1:46:15.100
 So obviously when we are writing things right now,

1:46:15.100 --> 1:46:16.460
 everything that we are writing now

1:46:16.460 --> 1:46:18.020
 is going to be training data

1:46:18.020 --> 1:46:20.100
 for the next generation of machine learning models.

1:46:20.100 --> 1:46:23.100
 So yes, of course, GPT4 is listening to us.

1:46:23.100 --> 1:46:25.620
 And I think the tweet is already a little bit older

1:46:25.620 --> 1:46:27.500
 and we now have Voodao

1:46:27.500 --> 1:46:30.140
 and we have a number of other systems

1:46:30.140 --> 1:46:33.620
 that basically are placeholders for GPT4.

1:46:33.620 --> 1:46:35.980
 Don't know what open AIS plans are in this regard.

1:46:35.980 --> 1:46:39.060
 I read that tweet in several ways.

1:46:39.060 --> 1:46:42.700
 So one is obviously everything you put on the internet

1:46:42.700 --> 1:46:44.660
 is used as training data.

1:46:44.660 --> 1:46:49.580
 But in a second way I read it is in a,

1:46:49.580 --> 1:46:51.620
 we talked about agency.

1:46:51.620 --> 1:46:55.460
 I read it as almost like GPT4 is intelligent enough

1:46:55.460 --> 1:46:58.260
 to be choosing to listen.

1:46:58.260 --> 1:47:00.460
 So not only like did a programmer tell it

1:47:00.460 --> 1:47:03.700
 to collect this data and use it for training,

1:47:03.700 --> 1:47:06.220
 I almost saw the humorous angle,

1:47:06.220 --> 1:47:09.100
 which is like it has achieved AGI kind of thing.

1:47:09.100 --> 1:47:13.300
 Well, the thing is, could we be already be living in GPT5?

1:47:13.300 --> 1:47:18.300
 So GPT4 is listening and GPT5 actually constructing

1:47:18.300 --> 1:47:20.420
 the entirety of the reality where we...

1:47:20.420 --> 1:47:22.340
 Of course, in some sense,

1:47:22.340 --> 1:47:24.500
 what everybody is trying to do right now in AI

1:47:24.500 --> 1:47:27.540
 is to extend the transformer to be able to deal with video.

1:47:28.980 --> 1:47:31.860
 And there are very promising extensions, right?

1:47:31.860 --> 1:47:36.060
 There's a work by Google that is called Perceiver

1:47:36.060 --> 1:47:39.300
 and that is overcoming some of the limitations

1:47:39.300 --> 1:47:41.980
 of the transformer by letting it learn the topology

1:47:41.980 --> 1:47:44.900
 of the different modalities separately.

1:47:44.900 --> 1:47:49.900
 And by training it to find better input features.

1:47:50.060 --> 1:47:52.540
 So basically feature abstractions that are being used

1:47:52.540 --> 1:47:57.540
 by this successor to GPT3 are chosen such a way

1:47:58.140 --> 1:48:00.780
 that it's able to deal with video input.

1:48:00.780 --> 1:48:02.220
 And there is more to be done.

1:48:02.220 --> 1:48:07.220
 So one of the limitations of GPT3 is that it's amnesiac.

1:48:07.820 --> 1:48:09.980
 So it forgets everything beyond the two pages

1:48:09.980 --> 1:48:12.340
 that it currently reads also during generation,

1:48:12.340 --> 1:48:14.420
 not just during learning.

1:48:14.420 --> 1:48:16.580
 Do you think that's fixable

1:48:16.580 --> 1:48:18.700
 within the space of deep learning?

1:48:18.700 --> 1:48:21.340
 Can you just make a bigger, bigger, bigger input?

1:48:21.340 --> 1:48:24.500
 No, I don't think that our own working memory

1:48:24.500 --> 1:48:25.620
 is infinitely large.

1:48:25.620 --> 1:48:28.020
 It's probably also just a few thousand bits.

1:48:28.020 --> 1:48:31.060
 But what you can do is you can structure

1:48:31.060 --> 1:48:31.900
 this working memory.

1:48:31.900 --> 1:48:34.980
 So instead of just force feeding this thing,

1:48:34.980 --> 1:48:37.060
 a certain thing that it has to focus on,

1:48:37.060 --> 1:48:39.460
 and it's not allowed to focus on anything else

1:48:39.460 --> 1:48:41.100
 as its network,

1:48:41.100 --> 1:48:44.860
 you allow it to construct its own working memory as we do.

1:48:44.860 --> 1:48:46.780
 When we are reading a book,

1:48:46.780 --> 1:48:48.700
 it's not that we are focusing our attention

1:48:48.700 --> 1:48:52.380
 in such a way that we can only remember the current page.

1:48:52.380 --> 1:48:54.660
 We will also try to remember other pages

1:48:54.660 --> 1:48:56.860
 and try to undo what we learned from them

1:48:56.860 --> 1:48:58.660
 or modify what we learned from them.

1:48:58.660 --> 1:49:01.020
 We might get up and take another book from the shelf.

1:49:01.020 --> 1:49:03.060
 We might go out and ask somebody,

1:49:03.060 --> 1:49:06.860
 we can edit our working memory in any way that is useful

1:49:06.860 --> 1:49:09.260
 to put a context together that allows us

1:49:09.260 --> 1:49:13.100
 to draw the right inferences and to learn the right things.

1:49:13.100 --> 1:49:16.380
 So this ability to perform experiments on the world

1:49:16.380 --> 1:49:20.420
 based on an attempt to become fully coherent

1:49:20.420 --> 1:49:22.260
 and to achieve causal closure,

1:49:22.260 --> 1:49:24.860
 to achieve a certain aesthetic of your modeling,

1:49:24.860 --> 1:49:28.300
 that is something that eventually needs to be done.

1:49:28.300 --> 1:49:31.140
 And at the moment we are skirting this in some sense

1:49:31.140 --> 1:49:33.420
 by building systems that are larger and faster

1:49:33.420 --> 1:49:36.100
 so they can use dramatically larger resources

1:49:36.100 --> 1:49:38.700
 and human beings can do and much more training data

1:49:38.700 --> 1:49:40.420
 to get to models that in some sense

1:49:40.420 --> 1:49:42.380
 are already way superhuman

1:49:42.380 --> 1:49:45.500
 and in other ways are laughingly incoherent.

1:49:45.500 --> 1:49:50.060
 So do you think sort of making the systems like,

1:49:50.060 --> 1:49:51.900
 what would you say, multi resolutional?

1:49:51.900 --> 1:49:56.900
 So like some of the language models

1:49:56.980 --> 1:49:59.820
 are focused on two pages,

1:49:59.820 --> 1:50:03.380
 some are focused on two books,

1:50:03.380 --> 1:50:06.580
 some are focused on two years of reading,

1:50:06.580 --> 1:50:08.100
 some are focused on a lifetime,

1:50:08.100 --> 1:50:11.900
 so it's like stacks of GPT3s all the way down.

1:50:11.900 --> 1:50:13.700
 You want to have gaps in between them.

1:50:13.700 --> 1:50:17.060
 So it's not necessarily two years, there's no gaps.

1:50:17.060 --> 1:50:19.980
 It's things out of two years or out of 20 years

1:50:19.980 --> 1:50:22.220
 or 2,000 years or 2 billion years

1:50:22.220 --> 1:50:24.580
 where you are just selecting those bits

1:50:24.580 --> 1:50:27.540
 that are predicted to be the most useful ones

1:50:27.540 --> 1:50:29.700
 to understand what you're currently doing.

1:50:29.700 --> 1:50:32.780
 And this prediction itself requires a very complicated model

1:50:32.780 --> 1:50:34.780
 and that's the actual model that you need to be making.

1:50:34.780 --> 1:50:36.940
 It's not just that you are trying to understand

1:50:36.940 --> 1:50:38.340
 the relationships between things,

1:50:38.340 --> 1:50:40.740
 but what you need to make relationships,

1:50:40.740 --> 1:50:42.540
 discover relationships over.

1:50:42.540 --> 1:50:45.500
 I wonder what that thing looks like,

1:50:45.500 --> 1:50:47.820
 what the architecture for the thing

1:50:47.820 --> 1:50:50.100
 that's able to have that kind of model.

1:50:50.100 --> 1:50:52.460
 I think it needs more degrees of freedom

1:50:52.460 --> 1:50:54.300
 than the current models have.

1:50:54.300 --> 1:50:57.420
 So it starts out with the fact that you possibly

1:50:57.420 --> 1:50:59.700
 don't just want to have a feed forward model,

1:50:59.700 --> 1:51:02.700
 but you want it to be fully recurrent.

1:51:02.700 --> 1:51:04.540
 And to make it fully recurrent,

1:51:04.540 --> 1:51:06.660
 you probably need to loop it back into itself

1:51:06.660 --> 1:51:08.220
 and allow it to skip connections.

1:51:08.220 --> 1:51:09.980
 Once you do this,

1:51:09.980 --> 1:51:12.020
 when you're predicting the next frame

1:51:12.020 --> 1:51:15.180
 and your internal next frame in every moment,

1:51:15.180 --> 1:51:17.500
 and you are able to skip connection,

1:51:17.500 --> 1:51:21.300
 it means that signals can travel from the output

1:51:21.300 --> 1:51:24.300
 of the network into the middle of the network

1:51:24.300 --> 1:51:25.900
 faster than the inputs do.

1:51:25.900 --> 1:51:28.780
 Do you think it can still be differentiable?

1:51:28.780 --> 1:51:30.660
 Do you think it still can be a neural network?

1:51:30.660 --> 1:51:32.980
 Sometimes it can and sometimes it cannot.

1:51:32.980 --> 1:51:35.500
 So it can still be a neural network,

1:51:35.500 --> 1:51:37.180
 but not a fully differentiable one.

1:51:37.180 --> 1:51:40.900
 And when you want to deal with non differentiable ones,

1:51:40.900 --> 1:51:42.780
 you need to have an attention system

1:51:42.780 --> 1:51:44.780
 that is discreet and two dimensional

1:51:44.780 --> 1:51:46.660
 and can perform grammatical operations.

1:51:46.660 --> 1:51:49.300
 You need to be able to perform program synthesis.

1:51:49.300 --> 1:51:51.220
 You need to be able to backtrack

1:51:51.220 --> 1:51:54.020
 in this operations that you perform on this thing.

1:51:54.020 --> 1:51:56.460
 And this thing needs a model of what it's currently doing.

1:51:56.460 --> 1:51:58.420
 And I think this is exactly the purpose

1:51:58.420 --> 1:51:59.860
 of our own consciousness.

1:52:01.220 --> 1:52:05.380
 Yeah, the program things are tricky on neural networks.

1:52:05.380 --> 1:52:09.020
 So let me ask you, it's not quite program synthesis,

1:52:09.020 --> 1:52:12.060
 but the application of these language models

1:52:12.060 --> 1:52:15.060
 to generation, to program synthesis,

1:52:15.060 --> 1:52:16.580
 but generation of programs.

1:52:16.580 --> 1:52:19.180
 So if you look at GitHub OpenPilot,

1:52:19.180 --> 1:52:21.220
 which is based on OpenAI's codecs,

1:52:21.220 --> 1:52:22.780
 I don't know if you got a chance to look at it,

1:52:22.780 --> 1:52:26.180
 but it's the system that's able to generate code

1:52:26.180 --> 1:52:30.100
 once you prompt it with, what is it?

1:52:30.100 --> 1:52:32.700
 Like the header of a function with some comments.

1:52:32.700 --> 1:52:36.060
 And it seems to do an incredibly good job

1:52:36.060 --> 1:52:39.220
 or not a perfect job, which is very important,

1:52:39.220 --> 1:52:42.780
 but an incredibly good job of generating functions.

1:52:42.780 --> 1:52:44.220
 What do you make of that?

1:52:44.220 --> 1:52:45.500
 Are you, is this exciting

1:52:45.500 --> 1:52:48.980
 or is this just a party trick, a demo?

1:52:48.980 --> 1:52:50.460
 Or is this revolutionary?

1:52:51.860 --> 1:52:52.980
 I haven't worked with it yet.

1:52:52.980 --> 1:52:55.140
 So it's difficult for me to judge it,

1:52:55.140 --> 1:52:57.100
 but I would not be surprised

1:52:57.100 --> 1:52:59.540
 if it turns out to be a revolutionary.

1:52:59.540 --> 1:53:01.740
 And that's because the majority of programming tasks

1:53:01.740 --> 1:53:04.260
 that are being done in the industry right now

1:53:04.260 --> 1:53:05.940
 are not creative.

1:53:05.940 --> 1:53:08.500
 People are writing code that other people have written,

1:53:08.500 --> 1:53:10.620
 or they're putting things together from code fragments

1:53:10.620 --> 1:53:11.540
 that others have had.

1:53:11.540 --> 1:53:14.300
 And a lot of the work that programmers do in practice

1:53:14.300 --> 1:53:17.780
 is to figure out how to overcome the gaps

1:53:17.780 --> 1:53:18.900
 in their current knowledge

1:53:18.900 --> 1:53:20.940
 and the things that people have already done.

1:53:20.940 --> 1:53:24.060
 How to copy and paste from Stack Overflow, that's right.

1:53:24.060 --> 1:53:26.380
 And so of course we can automate that.

1:53:26.380 --> 1:53:29.900
 Yeah, to make it much faster to copy and paste

1:53:29.900 --> 1:53:30.860
 from Stack Overflow.

1:53:30.860 --> 1:53:32.820
 Yes, but it's not just copying and pasting.

1:53:32.820 --> 1:53:36.580
 It's also basically learning which parts you need to modify

1:53:36.580 --> 1:53:38.140
 to make them fit together.

1:53:38.140 --> 1:53:41.180
 Yeah, like literally sometimes as simple

1:53:41.180 --> 1:53:43.380
 as just changing the variable names.

1:53:43.380 --> 1:53:45.060
 So it fits into the rest of your code.

1:53:45.060 --> 1:53:47.460
 Yes, but this requires that you understand the semantics

1:53:47.460 --> 1:53:49.660
 of what you're doing to some degree.

1:53:49.660 --> 1:53:51.580
 And you can automate some of those things.

1:53:51.580 --> 1:53:53.500
 The thing that makes people nervous of course

1:53:53.500 --> 1:53:57.780
 is that a little bit wrong in a program

1:53:57.780 --> 1:54:02.700
 can have a dramatic effect on the actual final operation

1:54:02.700 --> 1:54:03.540
 of that program.

1:54:03.540 --> 1:54:05.380
 So that's one little error,

1:54:05.380 --> 1:54:08.780
 which in the space of language doesn't really matter,

1:54:08.780 --> 1:54:11.980
 but in the space of programs can matter a lot.

1:54:11.980 --> 1:54:14.100
 Yes, but this is already what is happening

1:54:14.100 --> 1:54:15.820
 when humans program code.

1:54:15.820 --> 1:54:16.820
 Yeah, this is.

1:54:16.820 --> 1:54:20.220
 So we have a technology to deal with this.

1:54:20.220 --> 1:54:23.500
 Somehow it becomes scarier when you know

1:54:23.500 --> 1:54:25.100
 that a program generated code

1:54:25.100 --> 1:54:27.940
 that's running a nuclear power plant.

1:54:27.940 --> 1:54:29.100
 It becomes scarier.

1:54:29.100 --> 1:54:31.380
 You know, humans have errors too.

1:54:31.380 --> 1:54:32.220
 Exactly.

1:54:32.220 --> 1:54:35.100
 But it's scarier when a program is doing it

1:54:35.100 --> 1:54:38.700
 because why, why?

1:54:38.700 --> 1:54:43.660
 I mean, there's a fear that a program,

1:54:43.660 --> 1:54:48.020
 like a program may not be as good as humans

1:54:48.020 --> 1:54:51.340
 to know when stuff is important to not mess up.

1:54:51.340 --> 1:54:56.340
 Like there's a misalignment of priorities of values

1:55:00.260 --> 1:55:01.300
 that's potential.

1:55:01.300 --> 1:55:03.500
 Maybe that's the source of the worry.

1:55:03.500 --> 1:55:06.380
 I mean, okay, if I give you code generated

1:55:06.380 --> 1:55:11.380
 by GitHub open pilot and code generated by a human

1:55:12.500 --> 1:55:16.020
 and say here, use one of these,

1:55:16.020 --> 1:55:20.380
 which how do you select today and in the next 10 years

1:55:20.380 --> 1:55:21.860
 which code do you use?

1:55:21.860 --> 1:55:24.300
 Wouldn't you still be comfortable with the human?

1:55:25.380 --> 1:55:29.580
 At the moment when you go to Stanford to get an MRI,

1:55:29.580 --> 1:55:34.580
 they will write a bill to the insurance over $20,000.

1:55:34.580 --> 1:55:38.300
 And of this, maybe half of that gets paid by the insurance

1:55:38.300 --> 1:55:40.580
 and a quarter gets paid by you.

1:55:40.580 --> 1:55:44.940
 And the MRI cost them $600 to make maybe probably less.

1:55:44.940 --> 1:55:47.700
 And what are the values of the person

1:55:47.700 --> 1:55:50.540
 that writes the software and deploys this process?

1:55:51.820 --> 1:55:56.260
 It's very difficult for me to say whether I trust people.

1:55:56.260 --> 1:55:58.700
 I think that what happens there is a mixture

1:55:58.700 --> 1:56:01.980
 of proper Anglo Saxon Protestant values

1:56:01.980 --> 1:56:04.860
 where somebody is trying to serve an abstract radar hole

1:56:04.860 --> 1:56:06.300
 and organize crime.

1:56:06.300 --> 1:56:08.060
 Well, that's a very harsh,

1:56:10.980 --> 1:56:15.500
 I think that's a harsh view of humanity.

1:56:15.500 --> 1:56:18.780
 There's a lot of bad people, whether incompetent

1:56:18.780 --> 1:56:21.700
 or just malevolent in this world, yes.

1:56:21.700 --> 1:56:25.820
 But it feels like the more malevolent,

1:56:25.820 --> 1:56:28.260
 so the more damage you do to the world,

1:56:29.580 --> 1:56:34.420
 the more resistance you have in your own human heart.

1:56:34.420 --> 1:56:37.140
 Yeah, but don't explain with malevolence or stupidity

1:56:37.140 --> 1:56:38.780
 what can be explained by just people

1:56:38.780 --> 1:56:40.100
 acting on their incentives.

1:56:41.540 --> 1:56:42.940
 Right, so what happens in Stanford

1:56:42.940 --> 1:56:45.100
 is not that somebody is evil.

1:56:45.100 --> 1:56:48.740
 It's just that they do what they're being paid for.

1:56:48.740 --> 1:56:50.500
 No, it's not evil.

1:56:50.500 --> 1:56:53.740
 That's, I tend to, no, I see that as malevolence.

1:56:53.740 --> 1:56:58.740
 I see as I, even like being a good German,

1:56:58.780 --> 1:57:01.540
 as I told you offline, is some,

1:57:01.540 --> 1:57:05.060
 it's not absolute malevolence,

1:57:05.060 --> 1:57:07.460
 but it's a small amount, it's cowardice.

1:57:07.460 --> 1:57:10.580
 I mean, when you see there's something wrong with the world,

1:57:10.580 --> 1:57:15.100
 it's either incompetence and you're not able to see it,

1:57:15.100 --> 1:57:17.780
 or it's cowardice that you're not able to stand up,

1:57:17.780 --> 1:57:21.620
 not necessarily in a big way, but in a small way.

1:57:21.620 --> 1:57:25.940
 So I do think that is a bit of malevolence.

1:57:25.940 --> 1:57:27.660
 I'm not sure the example you're describing

1:57:27.660 --> 1:57:28.500
 is a good example of that.

1:57:28.500 --> 1:57:31.220
 So the question is, what is it that you are aiming for?

1:57:31.220 --> 1:57:34.900
 And if you don't believe in the future,

1:57:34.900 --> 1:57:37.460
 if you, for instance, think that the dollar is going to crash,

1:57:37.460 --> 1:57:39.540
 why would you try to save dollars?

1:57:39.540 --> 1:57:42.580
 If you don't think that humanity will be around

1:57:42.580 --> 1:57:43.740
 in a hundred years from now,

1:57:43.740 --> 1:57:47.500
 because global warming will wipe out civilization,

1:57:47.500 --> 1:57:50.220
 why would you need to act as if it were?

1:57:50.220 --> 1:57:51.660
 Right, so the question is,

1:57:51.660 --> 1:57:53.980
 is there an overarching aesthetics

1:57:53.980 --> 1:57:56.900
 that is projecting you and the world into the future,

1:57:56.900 --> 1:57:59.020
 which I think is the basic idea of religion,

1:57:59.020 --> 1:58:01.220
 that you understand the interactions

1:58:01.220 --> 1:58:02.340
 that we have with each other

1:58:02.340 --> 1:58:04.780
 as some kind of civilization level agent

1:58:04.780 --> 1:58:07.180
 that is projecting itself into the future.

1:58:07.180 --> 1:58:10.420
 If you don't have that shared purpose,

1:58:10.420 --> 1:58:12.940
 what is there to be ethical for?

1:58:12.940 --> 1:58:16.380
 So I think when we talk about ethics and AI,

1:58:16.380 --> 1:58:20.020
 we need to go beyond the insane bias discussions and so on,

1:58:20.020 --> 1:58:22.060
 where people are just measuring the distance

1:58:22.060 --> 1:58:27.060
 between a statistic to their preferred current world model.

1:58:27.940 --> 1:58:29.340
 The optimism, wait, wait, wait,

1:58:29.340 --> 1:58:31.180
 I was a little confused by the previous thing,

1:58:31.180 --> 1:58:32.260
 just to clarify.

1:58:32.260 --> 1:58:37.260
 There is a kind of underlying morality

1:58:39.820 --> 1:58:43.620
 to having an optimism that human civilization

1:58:43.620 --> 1:58:45.580
 will persist for longer than a hundred years.

1:58:45.580 --> 1:58:49.020
 Like I think a lot of people believe

1:58:50.060 --> 1:58:53.220
 that it's a good thing for us to keep living.

1:58:53.220 --> 1:58:54.060
 Yeah, of course.

1:58:54.060 --> 1:58:54.900
 And thriving.

1:58:54.900 --> 1:58:56.900
 This morality itself is not an end to itself.

1:58:56.900 --> 1:58:59.660
 It's instrumental to people living in a hundred years

1:58:59.660 --> 1:59:03.100
 from now or 500 years from now.

1:59:03.100 --> 1:59:06.540
 So it's only justifiable if you actually think

1:59:06.540 --> 1:59:09.780
 that it will lead to people or increase the probability

1:59:09.780 --> 1:59:12.500
 of people being around in that timeframe.

1:59:12.500 --> 1:59:14.980
 And a lot of people don't actually believe that,

1:59:14.980 --> 1:59:16.860
 at least not actively.

1:59:16.860 --> 1:59:17.980
 But believe what exactly?

1:59:17.980 --> 1:59:19.180
 So I was...

1:59:19.180 --> 1:59:20.620
 Most people don't believe

1:59:20.620 --> 1:59:23.500
 that they can afford to act on such a model.

1:59:23.500 --> 1:59:25.340
 Basically what happens in the US

1:59:25.340 --> 1:59:26.940
 is I think that the healthcare system

1:59:26.940 --> 1:59:28.940
 is for a lot of people no longer sustainable,

1:59:28.940 --> 1:59:30.580
 which means that if they need the help

1:59:30.580 --> 1:59:31.540
 of the healthcare system,

1:59:31.540 --> 1:59:33.460
 they're often not able to afford it.

1:59:33.460 --> 1:59:35.060
 And when they cannot help it,

1:59:35.060 --> 1:59:37.300
 they are often going bankrupt.

1:59:37.300 --> 1:59:40.220
 I think the leading cause of personal bankruptcy

1:59:40.220 --> 1:59:42.740
 in the US is the healthcare system.

1:59:42.740 --> 1:59:44.820
 And that would not be necessary.

1:59:44.820 --> 1:59:46.660
 It's not because people are consuming

1:59:46.660 --> 1:59:48.780
 more and more medical services

1:59:48.780 --> 1:59:51.460
 and are achieving a much, much longer life as a result.

1:59:51.460 --> 1:59:53.620
 That's not actually the story that is happening

1:59:53.620 --> 1:59:55.300
 because you can compare it to other countries.

1:59:55.300 --> 1:59:58.420
 And life expectancy in the US is currently not increasing

1:59:58.420 --> 2:00:00.420
 and it's not as high as in all the other

2:00:00.420 --> 2:00:01.700
 industrialized countries.

2:00:01.700 --> 2:00:03.820
 So some industrialized countries are doing better

2:00:03.820 --> 2:00:06.260
 with a much cheaper healthcare system.

2:00:06.260 --> 2:00:08.580
 And what you can see is for instance,

2:00:08.580 --> 2:00:09.980
 administrative bloat.

2:00:09.980 --> 2:00:13.660
 The healthcare system has maybe to some degree

2:00:13.660 --> 2:00:17.220
 deliberately set up as a job placement program

2:00:17.220 --> 2:00:19.740
 to allow people to continue living

2:00:19.740 --> 2:00:20.940
 in middle class existence,

2:00:20.940 --> 2:00:25.940
 despite not having useful use case in productivity.

2:00:25.940 --> 2:00:28.700
 So they are being paid to push paper around.

2:00:28.700 --> 2:00:31.540
 And the number of administrator in the healthcare system

2:00:31.540 --> 2:00:33.180
 has been increasing much faster

2:00:33.180 --> 2:00:35.020
 than the number of practitioners.

2:00:35.020 --> 2:00:37.060
 And this is something that you have to pay for.

2:00:37.060 --> 2:00:40.460
 And also the revenues that are being generated

2:00:40.460 --> 2:00:42.220
 in the healthcare system are relatively large

2:00:42.220 --> 2:00:43.700
 and somebody has to pay for them.

2:00:43.700 --> 2:00:45.900
 And the result why they are so large

2:00:45.900 --> 2:00:48.460
 is because market mechanisms are not working.

2:00:48.460 --> 2:00:51.860
 The FDA is largely not protecting people

2:00:51.860 --> 2:00:55.380
 from malpractice of healthcare providers.

2:00:55.380 --> 2:00:58.660
 The FDA is protecting healthcare providers

2:00:58.660 --> 2:00:59.940
 from competition.

2:00:59.940 --> 2:01:00.780
 Right, okay.

2:01:00.780 --> 2:01:03.380
 So this is a thing that has to do with values.

2:01:03.380 --> 2:01:06.500
 And this is not because people are malicious on all levels.

2:01:06.500 --> 2:01:08.460
 It's because they are not incentivized

2:01:08.460 --> 2:01:11.380
 to act on a greater whole on this idea

2:01:11.380 --> 2:01:14.340
 that you treat somebody who comes to you as a patient,

2:01:14.340 --> 2:01:15.660
 like you would treat a family member.

2:01:15.660 --> 2:01:18.020
 Yeah, but we're trying, I mean,

2:01:18.020 --> 2:01:20.020
 you're highlighting a lot of the flaws

2:01:20.020 --> 2:01:21.220
 of the different institutions,

2:01:21.220 --> 2:01:23.100
 the systems we're operating under,

2:01:23.100 --> 2:01:25.940
 but I think there's a continued throughout history

2:01:25.940 --> 2:01:29.380
 mechanism design of trying to design incentives

2:01:29.380 --> 2:01:31.420
 in such a way that these systems behave

2:01:31.420 --> 2:01:32.780
 better and better and better.

2:01:32.780 --> 2:01:34.220
 I mean, it's a very difficult thing

2:01:34.220 --> 2:01:38.140
 to operate a society of hundreds of millions of people

2:01:38.140 --> 2:01:39.220
 effectively with.

2:01:39.220 --> 2:01:42.820
 Yes, so do we live in a society that is ever correcting?

2:01:42.820 --> 2:01:46.740
 Is this, do we observe that our models

2:01:46.740 --> 2:01:49.420
 of what we are doing are predictive of the future

2:01:49.420 --> 2:01:51.540
 and when they are not, we improve them.

2:01:51.540 --> 2:01:54.780
 Are our laws adjudicated with clauses

2:01:54.780 --> 2:01:56.020
 that you put into every law,

2:01:56.020 --> 2:01:57.900
 what is meant to be achieved by that law

2:01:57.900 --> 2:02:00.060
 and the law will be automatically repealed

2:02:00.060 --> 2:02:01.340
 if it's not achieving that, right?

2:02:01.340 --> 2:02:03.220
 If you are optimizing your own laws,

2:02:03.220 --> 2:02:05.140
 if you're writing your own source code,

2:02:05.140 --> 2:02:08.180
 you probably make an estimate of what is this thing

2:02:08.180 --> 2:02:09.420
 that's currently wrong in my life?

2:02:09.420 --> 2:02:12.180
 What is it that I should change about my own policies?

2:02:12.180 --> 2:02:14.100
 What is the expected outcome?

2:02:14.100 --> 2:02:16.580
 And if that outcome doesn't manifest,

2:02:16.580 --> 2:02:18.460
 I will change the policy back, right?

2:02:18.460 --> 2:02:20.260
 Or I would change it to something different.

2:02:20.260 --> 2:02:22.220
 Are we doing this on a societal level?

2:02:22.220 --> 2:02:23.060
 I think so.

2:02:23.060 --> 2:02:25.580
 I think it's easy to sort of highlight the,

2:02:25.580 --> 2:02:27.940
 I think we're doing it in the way that,

2:02:29.020 --> 2:02:30.380
 like I operate my current life.

2:02:30.380 --> 2:02:32.580
 I didn't sleep much last night.

2:02:32.580 --> 2:02:34.740
 You would say that Lex,

2:02:34.740 --> 2:02:35.980
 the way you need to operate your life

2:02:35.980 --> 2:02:37.340
 is you need to always get sleep.

2:02:37.340 --> 2:02:39.060
 The fact that you didn't sleep last night

2:02:39.060 --> 2:02:43.060
 is totally the wrong way to operate in your life.

2:02:43.060 --> 2:02:46.460
 Like you should have gotten all your shit done in time

2:02:46.460 --> 2:02:48.940
 and gotten to sleep because sleep is very important

2:02:48.940 --> 2:02:50.540
 for health and you're highlighting,

2:02:50.540 --> 2:02:52.500
 look, this person is not sleeping.

2:02:52.500 --> 2:02:56.380
 Look, the medical, the healthcare system is operating poor.

2:02:56.380 --> 2:02:59.140
 But the point is we just,

2:02:59.140 --> 2:03:00.460
 it seems like this is the way,

2:03:00.460 --> 2:03:02.700
 especially in the capitalist society, we operate.

2:03:02.700 --> 2:03:05.740
 We keep running into trouble and last minute,

2:03:05.740 --> 2:03:09.260
 we try to get our way out through innovation

2:03:09.260 --> 2:03:10.740
 and it seems to work.

2:03:10.740 --> 2:03:13.380
 You have a lot of people that ultimately are trying

2:03:13.380 --> 2:03:18.380
 to build a better world and get urgency about them

2:03:18.380 --> 2:03:22.900
 when the problem becomes more and more imminent.

2:03:22.900 --> 2:03:24.380
 And that's the way this operates.

2:03:24.380 --> 2:03:29.380
 But if you look at the long arc of history,

2:03:29.820 --> 2:03:33.140
 it seems like that operating on deadlines

2:03:34.180 --> 2:03:36.980
 produces progress and builds better and better systems.

2:03:36.980 --> 2:03:39.060
 You probably agree with me that the US

2:03:39.060 --> 2:03:44.060
 should have engaged in mask production in January 2020

2:03:44.580 --> 2:03:47.900
 and that we should have shut down the airports early on

2:03:47.900 --> 2:03:50.940
 and that we should have made it mandatory

2:03:50.940 --> 2:03:53.860
 that the people that work in nursing homes

2:03:53.860 --> 2:03:57.940
 are living on campus rather than living at home

2:03:57.940 --> 2:04:01.460
 and then coming in and infecting people in the nursing homes

2:04:01.460 --> 2:04:03.900
 that had no immune response to COVID.

2:04:03.900 --> 2:04:08.180
 And that is something that was, I think, visible back then.

2:04:08.180 --> 2:04:10.540
 The correct decisions haven't been made.

2:04:10.540 --> 2:04:12.580
 We would have the same situation again.

2:04:12.580 --> 2:04:14.340
 How do we know that these wrong decisions

2:04:14.340 --> 2:04:15.780
 are not being made again?

2:04:15.780 --> 2:04:17.620
 Have the people that made the decisions

2:04:17.620 --> 2:04:20.580
 to not protect the nursing homes been punished?

2:04:20.580 --> 2:04:23.180
 Have the people that made the wrong decisions

2:04:23.180 --> 2:04:26.780
 with respect to testing that prevented the development

2:04:26.780 --> 2:04:29.500
 of testing by startup companies and the importing

2:04:29.500 --> 2:04:32.140
 of tests from countries that already had them,

2:04:32.140 --> 2:04:34.460
 have these people been held responsible?

2:04:34.460 --> 2:04:37.380
 First of all, so what do you wanna put

2:04:37.380 --> 2:04:38.780
 before the firing squad?

2:04:38.780 --> 2:04:39.860
 I think they are being held responsible.

2:04:39.860 --> 2:04:41.820
 No, just make sure that this doesn't happen again.

2:04:41.820 --> 2:04:46.220
 No, but it's not that, yes, they're being held responsible

2:04:46.220 --> 2:04:48.820
 by many voices, by people being frustrated.

2:04:48.820 --> 2:04:50.740
 There's new leaders being born now

2:04:50.740 --> 2:04:54.220
 that we're going to see rise to the top in 10 years.

2:04:54.220 --> 2:04:57.380
 This moves slower than, there's obviously

2:04:57.380 --> 2:05:01.220
 a lot of older incompetence and bureaucracy

2:05:01.220 --> 2:05:03.660
 and these systems move slowly.

2:05:03.660 --> 2:05:06.860
 They move like science, one death at a time.

2:05:06.860 --> 2:05:11.340
 So yes, I think the pain that's been felt

2:05:11.340 --> 2:05:15.540
 in the previous year is reverberating throughout the world.

2:05:15.540 --> 2:05:18.340
 Maybe I'm getting old, I suspect that every generation

2:05:18.340 --> 2:05:21.500
 in the US after the war has lost the plot even more.

2:05:21.500 --> 2:05:23.140
 I don't see this development.

2:05:23.140 --> 2:05:24.700
 The war, World War II?

2:05:24.700 --> 2:05:29.140
 Yes, so basically there was a time when we were modernist

2:05:29.140 --> 2:05:33.620
 and in this modernist time, the US felt actively threatened

2:05:33.620 --> 2:05:35.740
 by the things that happened in the world.

2:05:35.740 --> 2:05:38.660
 The US was worried about possibility of failure

2:05:39.660 --> 2:05:44.580
 and this imminence of possible failure led to decisions.

2:05:44.580 --> 2:05:47.340
 There was a time when the government would listen

2:05:47.340 --> 2:05:50.540
 to physicists about how to do things

2:05:50.540 --> 2:05:52.100
 and the physicists were actually concerned

2:05:52.100 --> 2:05:53.580
 about what the government should be doing.

2:05:53.580 --> 2:05:56.100
 So they would be writing letters to the government

2:05:56.100 --> 2:05:58.860
 and so for instance, the decision for the Manhattan Project

2:05:58.860 --> 2:06:01.740
 was something that was driven in a conversation

2:06:01.740 --> 2:06:04.020
 between physicists and the government.

2:06:04.020 --> 2:06:06.900
 I don't think such a discussion would take place today.

2:06:06.900 --> 2:06:10.500
 I disagree, I think if the virus was much deadlier,

2:06:10.500 --> 2:06:12.620
 we would see a very different response.

2:06:12.620 --> 2:06:14.900
 I think the virus was not sufficiently deadly

2:06:14.900 --> 2:06:17.420
 and instead because it wasn't very deadly,

2:06:17.420 --> 2:06:20.420
 what happened is the current system

2:06:20.420 --> 2:06:21.980
 started to politicize it.

2:06:21.980 --> 2:06:25.300
 The mask, this is what I realized with masks early on,

2:06:25.300 --> 2:06:29.540
 they were not, very quickly became not as a solution

2:06:29.540 --> 2:06:32.620
 but they became a thing that politicians used

2:06:32.620 --> 2:06:33.900
 to divide the country.

2:06:33.900 --> 2:06:36.940
 So the same things happened with vaccines, same thing.

2:06:36.940 --> 2:06:38.740
 So like nobody's really,

2:06:38.740 --> 2:06:41.100
 people weren't talking about solutions to this problem

2:06:41.100 --> 2:06:43.060
 because I don't think the problem was bad enough.

2:06:43.060 --> 2:06:45.020
 When you talk about the war,

2:06:45.020 --> 2:06:47.900
 I think our lives are too comfortable.

2:06:48.740 --> 2:06:52.220
 I think in the developed world, things are too good

2:06:52.220 --> 2:06:54.900
 and we have not faced severe dangers.

2:06:54.900 --> 2:06:57.500
 When the danger, the severe dangers,

2:06:57.500 --> 2:07:00.740
 existential threats are faced, that's when we step up

2:07:00.740 --> 2:07:02.980
 on a small scale and a large scale.

2:07:02.980 --> 2:07:07.980
 Now, I don't, that's sort of my argument here

2:07:07.980 --> 2:07:11.700
 but I did think the virus is, I was hoping

2:07:11.700 --> 2:07:14.980
 that it was actually sufficiently dangerous

2:07:16.060 --> 2:07:18.660
 for us to step up because especially in the early days,

2:07:18.660 --> 2:07:23.260
 it was unclear, it still is unclear because of mutations,

2:07:23.260 --> 2:07:25.820
 how bad it might be, right?

2:07:25.820 --> 2:07:30.700
 And so I thought we would step up and even,

2:07:30.700 --> 2:07:35.540
 so the masks point is a tricky one because to me,

2:07:35.540 --> 2:07:38.780
 the manufacture of masks isn't even the problem.

2:07:38.780 --> 2:07:41.020
 I'm still to this day and I was involved

2:07:41.020 --> 2:07:44.300
 with a bunch of this work, have not seen good science done

2:07:44.300 --> 2:07:45.900
 on whether masks work or not.

2:07:46.860 --> 2:07:49.420
 Like there still has not been a large scale study.

2:07:49.420 --> 2:07:51.820
 To me, that should be, there should be large scale studies

2:07:51.820 --> 2:07:55.140
 and every possible solution, like aggressive

2:07:55.140 --> 2:07:56.780
 in the same way that the vaccine development

2:07:56.780 --> 2:07:57.740
 was aggressive.

2:07:57.740 --> 2:07:59.860
 There should be masks, which tests,

2:07:59.860 --> 2:08:03.740
 what kind of tests work really well, what kind of,

2:08:03.740 --> 2:08:06.860
 like even the question of how the virus spreads.

2:08:06.860 --> 2:08:09.820
 There should be aggressive studies on that to understand.

2:08:09.820 --> 2:08:12.860
 I'm still, as far as I know, there's still a lot

2:08:12.860 --> 2:08:14.180
 of uncertainty about that.

2:08:14.180 --> 2:08:17.100
 Nobody wants to see this as an engineering problem

2:08:17.100 --> 2:08:18.540
 that needs to be solved.

2:08:18.540 --> 2:08:21.940
 It's that I was surprised about, but I wouldn't.

2:08:21.940 --> 2:08:24.580
 So I find that our views are largely convergent

2:08:24.580 --> 2:08:25.460
 but not completely.

2:08:25.460 --> 2:08:29.340
 So I agree with the thing that because our society

2:08:29.340 --> 2:08:32.580
 in some sense perceives itself as too big to fail.

2:08:32.580 --> 2:08:33.420
 Right.

2:08:33.420 --> 2:08:35.940
 The virus did not alert people to the fact

2:08:35.940 --> 2:08:37.860
 that we are facing possible failure

2:08:38.820 --> 2:08:41.540
 that basically put us into the postmodernist mode.

2:08:41.540 --> 2:08:43.260
 And I don't mean in a philosophical sense

2:08:43.260 --> 2:08:45.220
 but in a societal sense.

2:08:45.220 --> 2:08:47.940
 The difference between the postmodern society

2:08:47.940 --> 2:08:50.540
 and the modern society is that the modernist society

2:08:50.540 --> 2:08:52.340
 has to deal with the ground truth

2:08:52.340 --> 2:08:55.540
 and the postmodernist society has to deal with appearances.

2:08:55.540 --> 2:08:57.820
 Politics becomes a performance

2:08:57.820 --> 2:08:59.780
 and the performance is done for an audience

2:08:59.780 --> 2:09:02.260
 and the organized audience is the media.

2:09:02.260 --> 2:09:05.380
 And the media evaluates itself via other media, right?

2:09:05.380 --> 2:09:09.100
 So you have an audience of critics that evaluate themselves.

2:09:09.100 --> 2:09:10.660
 And I don't think it's so much the failure

2:09:10.660 --> 2:09:12.820
 of the politicians because to get in power

2:09:12.820 --> 2:09:15.700
 and to stay in power, you need to be able

2:09:15.700 --> 2:09:17.580
 to deal with the published opinion.

2:09:17.580 --> 2:09:19.220
 Well, I think it goes in cycles

2:09:19.220 --> 2:09:22.300
 because what's going to happen is all

2:09:22.300 --> 2:09:24.820
 of the small business owners, all the people

2:09:24.820 --> 2:09:27.900
 who truly are suffering and will suffer more

2:09:27.900 --> 2:09:31.940
 because the effects of the closure of the economy

2:09:31.940 --> 2:09:34.220
 and the lack of solutions to the virus,

2:09:34.220 --> 2:09:36.300
 they're going to apprise.

2:09:36.300 --> 2:09:40.180
 And hopefully, I mean, this is where charismatic leaders

2:09:40.180 --> 2:09:42.620
 can get the world in trouble

2:09:42.620 --> 2:09:46.500
 but hopefully will elect great leaders

2:09:47.900 --> 2:09:51.100
 that will break through this postmodernist idea

2:09:51.100 --> 2:09:55.420
 of the media and the perception

2:09:55.420 --> 2:09:57.660
 and the drama on Twitter and all that kind of stuff.

2:09:57.660 --> 2:09:59.340
 But you know, this can go either way.

2:09:59.340 --> 2:10:00.300
 Yeah.

2:10:00.300 --> 2:10:03.620
 When the Weimar Republic was unable to deal

2:10:03.620 --> 2:10:07.540
 with the economic crisis that Germany was facing,

2:10:07.540 --> 2:10:09.100
 there was an option to go back.

2:10:10.340 --> 2:10:11.620
 But there were people which thought,

2:10:11.620 --> 2:10:14.420
 let's get back to a constitutional monarchy

2:10:14.420 --> 2:10:18.780
 and let's get this to work because democracy doesn't work.

2:10:18.780 --> 2:10:21.740
 And eventually, there was no way back.

2:10:21.740 --> 2:10:23.300
 People decided there was no way back.

2:10:23.300 --> 2:10:24.420
 They needed to go forward.

2:10:24.420 --> 2:10:26.700
 And the only options for going forward

2:10:26.700 --> 2:10:29.460
 was to become Stalinist communist,

2:10:29.460 --> 2:10:34.260
 basically an option to completely expropriate

2:10:34.260 --> 2:10:36.820
 the factories and so on and nationalize them

2:10:36.820 --> 2:10:40.540
 and to reorganize Germany in communist terms

2:10:40.540 --> 2:10:44.660
 and ally itself with Stalin and fascism.

2:10:44.660 --> 2:10:47.980
 And both options were obviously very bad.

2:10:47.980 --> 2:10:49.980
 And the one that the Germans picked

2:10:49.980 --> 2:10:54.300
 led to a catastrophe that devastated Europe.

2:10:54.300 --> 2:10:57.180
 And I'm not sure if the US has an immune response

2:10:57.180 --> 2:10:58.020
 against that.

2:10:58.020 --> 2:11:01.340
 I think that the far right is currently very weak in the US,

2:11:01.340 --> 2:11:02.940
 but this can easily change.

2:11:05.740 --> 2:11:08.780
 Do you think from a historical perspective,

2:11:08.780 --> 2:11:10.820
 Hitler could have been stopped

2:11:10.820 --> 2:11:14.020
 from within Germany or from outside?

2:11:14.020 --> 2:11:17.780
 Or this, well, depends on who you wanna focus,

2:11:17.780 --> 2:11:20.220
 whether you wanna focus on Stalin or Hitler,

2:11:20.220 --> 2:11:22.380
 but it feels like Hitler was the one

2:11:22.380 --> 2:11:25.180
 as a political movement that could have been stopped.

2:11:25.180 --> 2:11:28.700
 I think that the point was that a lot of people

2:11:28.700 --> 2:11:32.340
 wanted Hitler, so he got support from a lot of quarters.

2:11:32.340 --> 2:11:35.100
 There was a number of industrialists who supported him

2:11:35.100 --> 2:11:36.780
 because they thought that the democracy

2:11:36.780 --> 2:11:38.460
 is obviously not working and unstable

2:11:38.460 --> 2:11:40.620
 and you need a strong man.

2:11:40.620 --> 2:11:43.220
 And he was willing to play that part.

2:11:43.220 --> 2:11:45.460
 There were also people in the US who thought

2:11:45.460 --> 2:11:47.860
 that Hitler would stop Stalin

2:11:47.860 --> 2:11:51.460
 and would act as a bulwark against Bolshevism,

2:11:52.300 --> 2:11:54.140
 which he probably would have done, right?

2:11:54.140 --> 2:11:56.220
 But at which cost?

2:11:56.220 --> 2:11:59.740
 And then many of the things that he was going to do,

2:11:59.740 --> 2:12:03.780
 like the Holocaust, was something where people thought

2:12:03.780 --> 2:12:07.140
 this is rhetoric, he's not actually going to do this.

2:12:07.140 --> 2:12:10.020
 Especially many of the Jews themselves, which were humanists.

2:12:10.020 --> 2:12:12.300
 And for them, this was outside of the scope

2:12:12.300 --> 2:12:13.260
 that was thinkable.

2:12:13.260 --> 2:12:14.260
 Right.

2:12:14.260 --> 2:12:18.940
 I mean, I wonder if Hitler is uniquely,

2:12:20.140 --> 2:12:23.500
 I wanna carefully use this term, but uniquely evil.

2:12:23.500 --> 2:12:26.420
 So if Hitler was never born,

2:12:26.420 --> 2:12:29.100
 if somebody else would come in this place.

2:12:29.100 --> 2:12:33.780
 So like, just thinking about the progress of history,

2:12:33.780 --> 2:12:36.700
 how important are those singular figures

2:12:36.700 --> 2:12:40.980
 that lead to mass destruction and cruelty?

2:12:40.980 --> 2:12:45.260
 Because my sense is Hitler was unique.

2:12:47.540 --> 2:12:49.420
 It wasn't just about the environment

2:12:49.420 --> 2:12:51.620
 and the context that gave him,

2:12:51.620 --> 2:12:54.740
 like another person would not come in his place

2:12:54.740 --> 2:12:58.220
 to do as destructive of the things that he did.

2:12:58.220 --> 2:13:02.860
 There was a combination of charisma, of madness,

2:13:02.860 --> 2:13:07.180
 of psychopathy, of just ego, all those things,

2:13:07.180 --> 2:13:09.540
 which are very unlikely to come together

2:13:09.540 --> 2:13:11.700
 in one person in the right time.

2:13:12.540 --> 2:13:14.660
 It also depends on the context of the country

2:13:14.660 --> 2:13:16.500
 that you're operating in.

2:13:16.500 --> 2:13:21.500
 If you tell the Germans that they have a historical destiny

2:13:22.220 --> 2:13:23.820
 in this romantic country,

2:13:23.820 --> 2:13:25.500
 the effect is probably different

2:13:25.500 --> 2:13:27.180
 than it is in other countries.

2:13:27.180 --> 2:13:32.180
 But Stalin has killed a few more people than Hitler did.

2:13:33.620 --> 2:13:35.820
 And if you look at the probability

2:13:35.820 --> 2:13:37.580
 that you survived under Stalin,

2:13:39.220 --> 2:13:43.140
 Hitler killed people if he thought

2:13:43.140 --> 2:13:45.140
 they were not worth living,

2:13:45.140 --> 2:13:49.260
 or if they were harmful to his racist project.

2:13:49.260 --> 2:13:52.580
 He basically felt that the Jews would be too cosmopolitan

2:13:52.580 --> 2:13:55.140
 and would not be willing to participate

2:13:55.140 --> 2:13:57.500
 in the racist redefinition of society

2:13:57.500 --> 2:13:58.780
 and the value of society,

2:13:58.780 --> 2:14:01.420
 and there is no state in this way

2:14:01.420 --> 2:14:03.260
 that he wanted to have it.

2:14:03.260 --> 2:14:06.980
 So he saw them as harmful danger,

2:14:06.980 --> 2:14:09.460
 especially since they played such an important role

2:14:09.460 --> 2:14:13.300
 in the economy and culture of Germany.

2:14:13.300 --> 2:14:18.020
 And so basically he had some radical

2:14:18.020 --> 2:14:20.780
 but rational reason to murder them.

2:14:20.780 --> 2:14:23.420
 And Stalin just killed everyone.

2:14:23.420 --> 2:14:26.140
 Basically the Stalinist purges were such a random thing

2:14:26.140 --> 2:14:31.140
 where he said that there's a certain possibility

2:14:31.580 --> 2:14:34.660
 that this particular part of the population

2:14:34.660 --> 2:14:36.740
 has a number of German collaborators or something,

2:14:36.740 --> 2:14:38.820
 and we just kill them all, right?

2:14:38.820 --> 2:14:40.660
 Or if you look at what Mao did,

2:14:40.660 --> 2:14:42.980
 the number of people that were killed

2:14:42.980 --> 2:14:45.620
 in absolute numbers were much higher under Mao

2:14:45.620 --> 2:14:47.660
 than they were under Stalin.

2:14:47.660 --> 2:14:49.820
 So it's super hard to say.

2:14:49.820 --> 2:14:53.540
 The other thing is that you look at Genghis Khan and so on,

2:14:53.540 --> 2:14:55.060
 how many people he killed.

2:14:56.100 --> 2:14:58.900
 When you see there are a number of things

2:14:58.900 --> 2:14:59.900
 that happen in human history

2:14:59.900 --> 2:15:02.500
 that actually really put a substantial dent

2:15:02.500 --> 2:15:05.900
 in the existing population, or Napoleon.

2:15:05.900 --> 2:15:09.500
 And it's very difficult to eventually measure it

2:15:09.500 --> 2:15:12.020
 because what's happening is basically evolution

2:15:12.020 --> 2:15:17.020
 on a human scale where one monkey figures out

2:15:17.220 --> 2:15:22.220
 a way to become viral and is using this viral technology

2:15:22.380 --> 2:15:24.500
 to change the patterns of society

2:15:24.500 --> 2:15:26.500
 at the very, very large scale.

2:15:26.500 --> 2:15:29.860
 And what we find so abhorrent about these changes

2:15:29.860 --> 2:15:32.340
 is the complexity that is being destroyed by this.

2:15:32.340 --> 2:15:34.940
 That's basically like a big fire that burns out

2:15:34.940 --> 2:15:36.780
 a lot of the existing culture and structure

2:15:36.780 --> 2:15:38.060
 that existed before.

2:15:38.060 --> 2:15:42.580
 Yeah, and it all just starts with one monkey.

2:15:42.580 --> 2:15:44.460
 One charismatic ape.

2:15:44.460 --> 2:15:46.060
 And there's a bunch of them throughout history.

2:15:46.060 --> 2:15:47.940
 Yeah, but it's in a given environment.

2:15:47.940 --> 2:15:51.100
 It's basically similar to wildfires in California, right?

2:15:51.100 --> 2:15:53.260
 The temperature is rising.

2:15:53.260 --> 2:15:55.540
 There is less rain falling.

2:15:55.540 --> 2:15:57.900
 And then suddenly a single spark can have an effect

2:15:57.900 --> 2:15:59.860
 that in other times would be contained.

2:16:00.780 --> 2:16:04.620
 Okay, speaking of which, I love how we went

2:16:04.620 --> 2:16:09.020
 to Hitler and Stalin from 20, 30 minutes ago,

2:16:09.020 --> 2:16:13.620
 GPT3 generating, doing programs that this is.

2:16:13.620 --> 2:16:18.300
 The argument was about morality of AI versus human.

2:16:23.580 --> 2:16:26.220
 And specifically in the context of writing programs,

2:16:26.220 --> 2:16:28.540
 specifically in the context of programs

2:16:28.540 --> 2:16:29.940
 that can be destructive.

2:16:29.940 --> 2:16:31.860
 So running nuclear power plants

2:16:31.860 --> 2:16:35.100
 or autonomous weapons systems, for example.

2:16:35.100 --> 2:16:39.580
 And I think your inclination was to say that

2:16:39.580 --> 2:16:43.460
 it's not so obvious that AI would be less moral than humans

2:16:43.460 --> 2:16:46.740
 or less effective at making a world

2:16:46.740 --> 2:16:48.660
 that would make humans happy.

2:16:48.660 --> 2:16:52.660
 So I'm not talking about self directed systems

2:16:52.660 --> 2:16:57.100
 that are making their own goals at a global scale.

2:16:57.100 --> 2:16:59.140
 If you just talk about the deployment

2:16:59.140 --> 2:17:03.380
 of technological systems that are able to see order

2:17:03.380 --> 2:17:05.580
 and patterns and use this as control models

2:17:05.580 --> 2:17:08.420
 to act on the goals that we give them,

2:17:08.420 --> 2:17:11.140
 then if we have the correct incentives

2:17:11.140 --> 2:17:13.180
 to set the correct incentives for these systems,

2:17:13.180 --> 2:17:14.380
 I'm quite optimistic.

2:17:16.060 --> 2:17:19.140
 So humans versus AI, let me give you an example.

2:17:20.660 --> 2:17:22.140
 Autonomous weapon system.

2:17:23.900 --> 2:17:26.900
 Let's say there's a city somewhere in the Middle East

2:17:26.900 --> 2:17:30.380
 that has a number of terrorists.

2:17:30.380 --> 2:17:32.180
 And the question is,

2:17:32.180 --> 2:17:35.020
 what's currently done with drone technologies,

2:17:35.020 --> 2:17:37.100
 you have information about the location

2:17:37.100 --> 2:17:40.620
 of a particular terrorist and you have a targeted attack,

2:17:40.620 --> 2:17:42.820
 you have a bombing of that particular building.

2:17:43.980 --> 2:17:45.900
 And that's all directed by humans

2:17:45.900 --> 2:17:47.980
 at the high level strategy

2:17:47.980 --> 2:17:50.580
 and also at the deployment of individual bombs and missiles

2:17:50.580 --> 2:17:53.940
 like the actual, everything is done by human

2:17:53.940 --> 2:17:56.700
 except the final targeting.

2:17:56.700 --> 2:18:01.700
 And it's like spot, similar thing, like control the flight.

2:18:01.820 --> 2:18:05.780
 Okay, what if you give AI control and saying,

2:18:07.860 --> 2:18:10.300
 write a program that says,

2:18:10.300 --> 2:18:12.180
 here's the best information I have available

2:18:12.180 --> 2:18:14.780
 about the location of these five terrorists,

2:18:14.780 --> 2:18:17.820
 here's the city, make sure all the bombing you do

2:18:17.820 --> 2:18:21.820
 is constrained to the city, make sure it's precision based,

2:18:21.820 --> 2:18:22.860
 but you take care of it.

2:18:22.860 --> 2:18:25.660
 So you do one level of abstraction out

2:18:25.660 --> 2:18:28.700
 and saying, take care of the terrorists in the city.

2:18:29.580 --> 2:18:31.420
 Which are you more comfortable with,

2:18:31.420 --> 2:18:35.700
 the humans or the JavaScript GPT3 generated code

2:18:35.700 --> 2:18:38.220
 that's doing the deployment?

2:18:38.220 --> 2:18:42.340
 I mean, this is the kind of question I'm asking,

2:18:42.340 --> 2:18:47.100
 is the kind of bugs that we see in human nature,

2:18:47.100 --> 2:18:51.220
 are they better or worse than the kind of bugs we see in AI?

2:18:51.220 --> 2:18:52.460
 There are different bugs.

2:18:52.460 --> 2:18:55.980
 There is an issue that if people are creating

2:18:55.980 --> 2:18:59.900
 an imperfect automation of a process

2:18:59.900 --> 2:19:02.860
 that normally requires a moral judgment,

2:19:02.860 --> 2:19:05.940
 and this moral judgment is the reason

2:19:05.940 --> 2:19:07.460
 why it cannot be automated often,

2:19:07.460 --> 2:19:12.180
 it's not because the computation is too expensive,

2:19:12.180 --> 2:19:14.300
 but because the model that you give the AI

2:19:14.300 --> 2:19:17.500
 is not an adequate model of the dynamics of the world,

2:19:17.500 --> 2:19:19.780
 because the AI does not understand the context

2:19:19.780 --> 2:19:21.940
 that it's operating in the right way.

2:19:21.940 --> 2:19:24.940
 And this is something that already happens with Excel.

2:19:24.940 --> 2:19:27.860
 You don't need to have an AI system to do this.

2:19:27.860 --> 2:19:30.340
 You have an automated process in place

2:19:30.340 --> 2:19:33.180
 where humans decide using automated criteria

2:19:33.180 --> 2:19:36.020
 whom to kill when and whom to target when,

2:19:36.020 --> 2:19:37.180
 which already happens.

2:19:38.220 --> 2:19:40.300
 And you have no way to get off the kill list

2:19:40.300 --> 2:19:42.860
 once that happens, once you have been targeted

2:19:42.860 --> 2:19:44.860
 according to some automatic criterion

2:19:44.860 --> 2:19:48.980
 by people in a bureaucracy, that is the issue.

2:19:48.980 --> 2:19:52.260
 The issue is not the AI, it's the automation.

2:19:52.260 --> 2:19:56.380
 So there's something about, right, it's automation,

2:19:56.380 --> 2:19:58.820
 but there's something about the,

2:19:58.820 --> 2:20:00.660
 there's a certain level of abstraction

2:20:00.660 --> 2:20:04.340
 where you give control to AI to do the automation.

2:20:04.340 --> 2:20:07.100
 There's a scale that can be achieved

2:20:07.100 --> 2:20:10.780
 that it feels like the scale of bug and scale mistake

2:20:10.780 --> 2:20:12.980
 and scale of destruction that can be achieved

2:20:14.580 --> 2:20:16.860
 of the kind that humans cannot achieve.

2:20:16.860 --> 2:20:19.620
 So AI is much more able to destroy

2:20:19.620 --> 2:20:22.580
 an entire country accidentally versus humans.

2:20:22.580 --> 2:20:27.300
 It feels like the more civilians die as they react

2:20:27.300 --> 2:20:30.900
 or suffer as the consequences of your decisions,

2:20:30.900 --> 2:20:34.260
 the more weight there is on the human mind

2:20:34.260 --> 2:20:35.500
 to make that decision.

2:20:36.380 --> 2:20:39.060
 And so like, it becomes more and more unlikely

2:20:39.060 --> 2:20:41.460
 to make that decision for humans.

2:20:41.460 --> 2:20:44.900
 For AI, it feels like it's harder to encode

2:20:44.900 --> 2:20:47.020
 that kind of weight.

2:20:47.020 --> 2:20:49.620
 In a way, the AI that we're currently building

2:20:49.620 --> 2:20:51.900
 is automating statistics, right?

2:20:51.900 --> 2:20:53.860
 Intelligence is the ability to make models

2:20:53.860 --> 2:20:55.220
 so you can act on them,

2:20:55.220 --> 2:20:57.420
 and AI is the tool to make better models.

2:20:58.340 --> 2:21:01.540
 So in principle, if you're using AI wisely,

2:21:01.540 --> 2:21:04.220
 you're able to prevent more harm.

2:21:04.220 --> 2:21:07.860
 And I think that the main issue is not on the side of the AI,

2:21:07.860 --> 2:21:09.940
 it's on the side of the human command hierarchy

2:21:09.940 --> 2:21:12.300
 that is using technology irresponsibly.

2:21:12.300 --> 2:21:15.740
 So the question is how hard is it to encode,

2:21:15.740 --> 2:21:19.060
 to properly encode the right incentives into the AI?

2:21:19.060 --> 2:21:21.420
 So for instance, there's this idea

2:21:21.420 --> 2:21:24.460
 of what happens if we let our airplanes being flown

2:21:24.460 --> 2:21:27.620
 with AI systems and the neural network is a black box

2:21:27.620 --> 2:21:28.460
 and so on.

2:21:28.460 --> 2:21:30.220
 And it turns out our neural networks

2:21:30.220 --> 2:21:32.300
 are actually not black boxes anymore.

2:21:32.300 --> 2:21:36.620
 There are function approximators using linear algebra,

2:21:36.620 --> 2:21:40.020
 and there are performing things that we can understand.

2:21:40.020 --> 2:21:42.820
 But we can also, instead of letting the neural network

2:21:42.820 --> 2:21:44.940
 fly the airplane, use the neural network

2:21:44.940 --> 2:21:47.420
 to generate a provably correct program.

2:21:47.420 --> 2:21:49.900
 There's a degree of accuracy of the proof

2:21:49.900 --> 2:21:51.860
 that a human could not achieve.

2:21:51.860 --> 2:21:54.100
 And so we can use our AI by combining

2:21:54.100 --> 2:21:56.460
 different technologies to build systems

2:21:56.460 --> 2:21:58.340
 that are much more reliable than the systems

2:21:58.340 --> 2:22:00.420
 that a human being could create.

2:22:00.420 --> 2:22:03.900
 And so in this sense, I would say that

2:22:03.900 --> 2:22:08.340
 if you use an early stage of technology to save labor

2:22:08.340 --> 2:22:11.340
 and don't employ competent people,

2:22:11.340 --> 2:22:14.180
 but just to hack something together because you can,

2:22:14.180 --> 2:22:15.260
 that is very dangerous.

2:22:15.260 --> 2:22:17.220
 And if people are acting under these incentives

2:22:17.220 --> 2:22:20.380
 that they get away with delivering shoddy work

2:22:20.380 --> 2:22:23.980
 more cheaply using AI with less human oversight than before,

2:22:23.980 --> 2:22:25.140
 that's very dangerous.

2:22:25.140 --> 2:22:28.980
 The thing is though, AI is still going to be unreliable,

2:22:28.980 --> 2:22:30.420
 perhaps less so than humans,

2:22:30.420 --> 2:22:33.820
 but it'll be unreliable in novel ways.

2:22:33.820 --> 2:22:35.340
 And...

2:22:35.340 --> 2:22:37.180
 Yeah, but this is an empirical question.

2:22:37.180 --> 2:22:39.860
 And it's something that we can figure out and work with.

2:22:39.860 --> 2:22:43.100
 So the issue is, do we trust the systems,

2:22:43.100 --> 2:22:45.340
 the social systems that we have in place

2:22:45.340 --> 2:22:48.020
 and the social systems that we can build and maintain

2:22:48.020 --> 2:22:50.420
 that they're able to use AI responsibly?

2:22:50.420 --> 2:22:52.980
 If they can, then AI is good news.

2:22:52.980 --> 2:22:54.100
 If they cannot,

2:22:54.100 --> 2:22:57.220
 then it's going to make the existing problems worse.

2:22:57.220 --> 2:23:00.100
 Well, and also who creates the AI, who controls it,

2:23:00.100 --> 2:23:03.140
 who makes money from it because it's ultimately humans.

2:23:03.140 --> 2:23:05.060
 And then you start talking about

2:23:05.060 --> 2:23:06.940
 how much you trust the humans.

2:23:06.940 --> 2:23:08.740
 So the question is, what does who mean?

2:23:08.740 --> 2:23:11.140
 I don't think that we have identity per se.

2:23:11.140 --> 2:23:15.500
 I think that the story of a human being is somewhat random.

2:23:15.500 --> 2:23:18.420
 What happens is more or less that everybody is acting

2:23:18.420 --> 2:23:19.780
 on their local incentives,

2:23:19.780 --> 2:23:21.980
 what they perceive to be their incentives.

2:23:21.980 --> 2:23:24.620
 And the question is, what are the incentives

2:23:24.620 --> 2:23:28.500
 that the one that is pressing the button is operating under?

2:23:28.500 --> 2:23:30.140
 Yeah.

2:23:30.140 --> 2:23:32.620
 It's nice for those incentives to be transparent.

2:23:32.620 --> 2:23:36.060
 So, for example, I'll give you an example.

2:23:36.060 --> 2:23:38.700
 There seems to be a significant distrust

2:23:38.700 --> 2:23:43.700
 of a tech, like entrepreneurs in the tech space

2:23:44.380 --> 2:23:47.380
 or people that run, for example, social media companies

2:23:47.380 --> 2:23:48.940
 like Mark Zuckerberg.

2:23:49.980 --> 2:23:53.060
 There's not a complete transparency of incentives

2:23:53.060 --> 2:23:56.740
 under which that particular human being operates.

2:23:58.940 --> 2:24:00.700
 We can listen to the words he says

2:24:00.700 --> 2:24:02.980
 or what the marketing team says for a company,

2:24:02.980 --> 2:24:04.220
 but we don't know.

2:24:04.220 --> 2:24:08.260
 And that becomes a problem when the algorithms

2:24:08.260 --> 2:24:12.780
 and the systems created by him and other people

2:24:12.780 --> 2:24:15.780
 in that company start having more and more impact

2:24:15.780 --> 2:24:17.180
 on society.

2:24:17.180 --> 2:24:21.940
 And that it starts, if the incentives were somehow

2:24:21.940 --> 2:24:26.020
 the definition and the explainability of the incentives

2:24:26.020 --> 2:24:30.860
 was decentralized such that nobody can manipulate it,

2:24:30.860 --> 2:24:35.580
 no propaganda type manipulation of like

2:24:35.580 --> 2:24:38.020
 how these systems actually operate could be done,

2:24:38.020 --> 2:24:43.020
 then yes, I think AI could achieve much fairer,

2:24:45.340 --> 2:24:50.340
 much more effective sort of like solutions

2:24:50.580 --> 2:24:53.260
 to difficult ethical problems.

2:24:53.260 --> 2:24:55.780
 But when there's like humans in the loop,

2:24:55.780 --> 2:25:00.580
 manipulating the dissemination, the communication

2:25:00.580 --> 2:25:02.420
 of how the system actually works,

2:25:02.420 --> 2:25:05.300
 that feels like you can run into a lot of trouble.

2:25:05.300 --> 2:25:07.740
 And that's why there's currently a lot of distrust

2:25:07.740 --> 2:25:10.180
 for people at the heads of companies

2:25:10.180 --> 2:25:12.660
 that have increasingly powerful AI systems.

2:25:13.900 --> 2:25:16.860
 I suspect what happened traditionally in the US

2:25:16.860 --> 2:25:18.700
 was that since our decision making

2:25:18.700 --> 2:25:22.980
 is much more decentralized than in an authoritarian state,

2:25:22.980 --> 2:25:24.780
 people are making decisions autonomously

2:25:24.780 --> 2:25:26.980
 at many, many levels in a society.

2:25:26.980 --> 2:25:30.260
 What happened that was we created coherence

2:25:30.260 --> 2:25:33.940
 and cohesion in society by controlling what people thought

2:25:33.940 --> 2:25:35.740
 and what information they had.

2:25:35.740 --> 2:25:38.740
 The media synchronized public opinion

2:25:38.740 --> 2:25:40.340
 and social media have disrupted this.

2:25:40.340 --> 2:25:43.780
 It's not, I think so much Russian influence or something,

2:25:43.780 --> 2:25:45.460
 it's everybody's influence.

2:25:45.460 --> 2:25:47.860
 It's that a random person can come up

2:25:47.860 --> 2:25:52.460
 with a conspiracy theory and disrupt what people think.

2:25:52.460 --> 2:25:55.460
 And if that conspiracy theory is more compelling

2:25:55.460 --> 2:25:58.180
 or more attractive than the standardized

2:25:58.180 --> 2:26:01.860
 public conspiracy theory that we give people as a default,

2:26:01.860 --> 2:26:03.460
 then it might get more traction, right?

2:26:03.460 --> 2:26:05.940
 You suddenly have the situation that a single individual

2:26:05.940 --> 2:26:10.060
 somewhere on a farm in Texas has more listeners than CNN.

2:26:11.140 --> 2:26:13.940
 Which particular farmer are you referring to in Texas?

2:26:17.380 --> 2:26:18.220
 Probably no.

2:26:19.180 --> 2:26:21.700
 Yes, I had dinner with him a couple of times, okay.

2:26:21.700 --> 2:26:23.420
 Right, it's an interesting situation

2:26:23.420 --> 2:26:25.940
 because you cannot get to be an anchor in CNN

2:26:25.940 --> 2:26:30.420
 if you don't go through a complicated gatekeeping process.

2:26:30.420 --> 2:26:32.460
 And suddenly you have random people

2:26:32.460 --> 2:26:34.900
 without that gatekeeping process,

2:26:34.900 --> 2:26:36.980
 just optimizing for attention.

2:26:36.980 --> 2:26:39.540
 Not necessarily with a lot of responsibility

2:26:39.540 --> 2:26:42.700
 for the longterm effects of projecting these theories

2:26:42.700 --> 2:26:43.900
 into the public.

2:26:43.900 --> 2:26:46.980
 And now there is a push of making social media

2:26:46.980 --> 2:26:48.380
 more like traditional media,

2:26:48.380 --> 2:26:51.380
 which means that the opinion that is being projected

2:26:51.380 --> 2:26:54.660
 in social media is more limited to an acceptable range.

2:26:54.660 --> 2:26:58.380
 With the goal of getting society into safe waters

2:26:58.380 --> 2:27:00.820
 and increase the stability and cohesion of society again,

2:27:00.820 --> 2:27:03.140
 which I think is a laudable goal.

2:27:03.140 --> 2:27:05.100
 But of course it also is an opportunity

2:27:05.100 --> 2:27:08.340
 to seize the means of indoctrination.

2:27:08.340 --> 2:27:11.420
 And the incentives that people are under when they do this

2:27:11.420 --> 2:27:16.420
 are in such a way that the AI ethics that we would need

2:27:17.140 --> 2:27:20.620
 becomes very often something like AI politics,

2:27:20.620 --> 2:27:23.380
 which is basically partisan and ideological.

2:27:23.380 --> 2:27:26.180
 And this means that whatever one side says,

2:27:26.180 --> 2:27:28.380
 another side is going to be disagreeing with, right?

2:27:28.380 --> 2:27:31.740
 In the same way as when you turn masks or the vaccine

2:27:31.740 --> 2:27:33.140
 into a political issue,

2:27:33.140 --> 2:27:35.700
 if you say that it is politically virtuous

2:27:35.700 --> 2:27:36.660
 to get vaccinated,

2:27:36.660 --> 2:27:39.260
 it will mean that the people that don't like you

2:27:39.260 --> 2:27:41.020
 will not want to get vaccinated, right?

2:27:41.020 --> 2:27:43.620
 And as soon as you have this partisan discourse,

2:27:43.620 --> 2:27:47.140
 it's going to be very hard to make the right decisions

2:27:47.140 --> 2:27:48.860
 because the incentives get to be the wrong ones.

2:27:48.860 --> 2:27:51.180
 AI ethics needs to be super boring.

2:27:51.180 --> 2:27:53.300
 It needs to be done by people who do statistics

2:27:53.300 --> 2:27:56.540
 all the time and have extremely boring,

2:27:56.540 --> 2:27:59.620
 long winded discussions that most people cannot follow

2:27:59.620 --> 2:28:00.900
 because they are too complicated,

2:28:00.900 --> 2:28:02.540
 but that are dead serious.

2:28:02.540 --> 2:28:05.820
 These people need to be able to be better at statistics

2:28:05.820 --> 2:28:07.940
 than the leading machine learning researchers.

2:28:07.940 --> 2:28:12.060
 And at the moment, the AI ethics debate is the one

2:28:12.060 --> 2:28:14.460
 where you don't have any barrier to entry, right?

2:28:14.460 --> 2:28:16.820
 Everybody who has a strong opinion

2:28:16.820 --> 2:28:18.860
 and is able to signal that opinion in the right way

2:28:18.860 --> 2:28:19.700
 can enter it.

2:28:19.700 --> 2:28:24.340
 And to me, that is a very frustrating thing

2:28:24.340 --> 2:28:26.260
 because the field is so crucially important

2:28:26.260 --> 2:28:27.100
 to our future.

2:28:27.100 --> 2:28:28.260
 It's so crucially important,

2:28:28.260 --> 2:28:31.860
 but the only qualification you currently need

2:28:31.860 --> 2:28:34.740
 is to be outraged by the injustice in the world.

2:28:34.740 --> 2:28:36.220
 It's more complicated, right?

2:28:36.220 --> 2:28:37.860
 Everybody seems to be outraged.

2:28:37.860 --> 2:28:40.740
 But let's just say that the incentives

2:28:40.740 --> 2:28:42.020
 are not always the right ones.

2:28:42.020 --> 2:28:45.500
 So basically, I suspect that a lot of people

2:28:45.500 --> 2:28:48.140
 that enter this debate don't have a vision

2:28:48.140 --> 2:28:50.020
 for what society should be looking like

2:28:50.020 --> 2:28:51.380
 in a way that is nonviolent,

2:28:51.380 --> 2:28:53.580
 where we preserve liberal democracy,

2:28:53.580 --> 2:28:56.300
 where we make sure that we all get along

2:28:56.300 --> 2:29:00.420
 and we are around in a few hundred years from now,

2:29:00.420 --> 2:29:02.180
 preferably with a comfortable

2:29:02.180 --> 2:29:04.820
 technological civilization around us.

2:29:04.820 --> 2:29:09.820
 I generally have a very foggy view of that world,

2:29:10.060 --> 2:29:12.060
 but I tend to try to follow,

2:29:12.060 --> 2:29:13.900
 and I think society should in some degree

2:29:13.900 --> 2:29:16.340
 follow the gradient of love,

2:29:16.340 --> 2:29:18.940
 increasing the amount of love in the world.

2:29:18.940 --> 2:29:21.100
 And whenever I see different policies

2:29:21.100 --> 2:29:24.460
 or algorithms or ideas that are not doing so,

2:29:24.460 --> 2:29:27.900
 obviously, that's the ones that kind of resist.

2:29:27.900 --> 2:29:30.740
 So the thing that terrifies me about this notion

2:29:30.740 --> 2:29:34.740
 is I think that German fascism was driven by love.

2:29:35.660 --> 2:29:37.820
 It was just a very selective love.

2:29:37.820 --> 2:29:39.140
 It was a love that basically...

2:29:39.140 --> 2:29:40.460
 Now you're just manipulating.

2:29:40.460 --> 2:29:45.460
 I mean, that's, you have to be very careful.

2:29:45.460 --> 2:29:50.460
 You're talking to the wrong person in this way about love.

2:29:50.580 --> 2:29:52.540
 So let's talk about what love is.

2:29:52.540 --> 2:29:55.980
 And I think that love is the discovery of shared purpose.

2:29:55.980 --> 2:29:59.700
 It's the recognition of the sacred in the other.

2:29:59.700 --> 2:30:02.780
 And this enables non transactional interactions.

2:30:02.780 --> 2:30:07.740
 But the size of the other that you include

2:30:07.740 --> 2:30:09.740
 needs to be maximized.

2:30:09.740 --> 2:30:14.700
 So it's basically appreciation,

2:30:14.700 --> 2:30:19.700
 like deep appreciation of the world around you fully,

2:30:23.540 --> 2:30:25.940
 including the people that are very different than you,

2:30:25.940 --> 2:30:27.700
 people that disagree with you completely,

2:30:27.700 --> 2:30:30.180
 including people, including living creatures

2:30:30.180 --> 2:30:33.460
 outside of just people, including ideas.

2:30:33.460 --> 2:30:36.580
 And it's like appreciation of the full mess of it.

2:30:36.580 --> 2:30:39.180
 And also it has to do with like empathy,

2:30:40.380 --> 2:30:44.020
 which is coupled with a lack of confidence

2:30:44.020 --> 2:30:47.140
 and certainty of your own rightness.

2:30:47.140 --> 2:30:51.140
 It's like a radical open mindedness to the way forward.

2:30:51.140 --> 2:30:53.460
 I agree with every part of what you said.

2:30:53.460 --> 2:30:54.980
 And now if you scale it up,

2:30:54.980 --> 2:30:58.540
 what you recognize is that Lafist is in some sense,

2:30:58.540 --> 2:31:01.380
 the service to next level agency,

2:31:01.380 --> 2:31:04.220
 to the highest level agency that you can recognize.

2:31:04.220 --> 2:31:07.860
 It could be for instance, life on earth or beyond that,

2:31:07.860 --> 2:31:11.620
 where you could say intelligent complexity in the universe

2:31:11.620 --> 2:31:14.100
 that you try to maximize in a certain way.

2:31:14.100 --> 2:31:15.860
 But when you think it's true,

2:31:15.860 --> 2:31:17.820
 it basically means a certain aesthetic.

2:31:18.980 --> 2:31:20.820
 And there is not one possible aesthetic,

2:31:20.820 --> 2:31:22.660
 there are many possible aesthetics.

2:31:22.660 --> 2:31:25.420
 And once you project an aesthetic into the future,

2:31:25.420 --> 2:31:29.260
 you can see that there are some which defect from it,

2:31:29.260 --> 2:31:30.900
 which are in conflict with it,

2:31:30.900 --> 2:31:32.500
 that are corrupt, that are evil.

2:31:33.860 --> 2:31:37.100
 You and me would probably agree that Hitler was evil

2:31:37.100 --> 2:31:39.980
 because the aesthetic of the world that he wanted

2:31:39.980 --> 2:31:41.940
 is in conflict with the aesthetic of the world

2:31:41.940 --> 2:31:43.340
 that you and me have in mind.

2:31:44.540 --> 2:31:48.500
 And so they think that he destroyed,

2:31:48.500 --> 2:31:50.660
 we want to keep them in the world.

2:31:50.660 --> 2:31:55.220
 There's a kind of, there's kind of ways to deal,

2:31:55.220 --> 2:31:56.660
 I mean, Hitler is an easier case,

2:31:56.660 --> 2:31:59.180
 but perhaps he wasn't so easy in the 30s, right?

2:31:59.180 --> 2:32:02.380
 To understand who is Hitler and who is not.

2:32:02.380 --> 2:32:04.580
 No, it was just there was no consensus

2:32:04.580 --> 2:32:07.500
 that the aesthetics that he had in mind were unacceptable.

2:32:07.500 --> 2:32:12.500
 Yeah, I mean, it's difficult, love is complicated

2:32:12.900 --> 2:32:17.300
 because you can't just be so open minded

2:32:17.300 --> 2:32:20.660
 that you let evil walk into the door,

2:32:20.660 --> 2:32:24.420
 but you can't be so self assured

2:32:24.420 --> 2:32:29.420
 that you can always identify evil perfectly

2:32:29.580 --> 2:32:32.620
 because that's what leads to Nazi Germany.

2:32:32.620 --> 2:32:34.860
 Having a certainty of what is and wasn't evil,

2:32:34.860 --> 2:32:37.540
 like always drawing lines of good versus evil.

2:32:38.660 --> 2:32:42.940
 There seems to be, there has to be a dance

2:32:42.940 --> 2:32:47.940
 between like hard stances extending up

2:32:49.900 --> 2:32:51.340
 against what is wrong.

2:32:51.340 --> 2:32:55.420
 And at the same time, empathy and open mindedness

2:32:55.420 --> 2:32:59.580
 of towards not knowing what is right and wrong

2:32:59.580 --> 2:33:01.420
 and like a dance between those.

2:33:01.420 --> 2:33:03.620
 I found that when I watched the Miyazaki movies

2:33:03.620 --> 2:33:06.060
 that there is nobody who captures my spirituality

2:33:06.060 --> 2:33:07.940
 as well as he does.

2:33:07.940 --> 2:33:10.620
 It's very interesting and just vicious, right?

2:33:10.620 --> 2:33:13.100
 There is something going on in his movies

2:33:13.100 --> 2:33:14.140
 that is very interesting.

2:33:14.140 --> 2:33:17.140
 So for instance, Mononoke is discussing

2:33:17.140 --> 2:33:22.140
 not only an answer to Disney's simplistic notion of Mowgli,

2:33:22.380 --> 2:33:24.980
 the jungle boy was raised by wolves.

2:33:24.980 --> 2:33:27.780
 And as soon as he sees people realizes that he's one of them

2:33:27.780 --> 2:33:32.780
 and the way in which the moral life and nature

2:33:32.780 --> 2:33:36.020
 is simplified and romanticized and turned into kitsch.

2:33:36.020 --> 2:33:37.700
 It's disgusting in the Disney movie.

2:33:37.700 --> 2:33:39.820
 And he answers to this, you see,

2:33:39.820 --> 2:33:42.260
 he's replaced by Mononoke, this wolf girl

2:33:42.260 --> 2:33:44.860
 who was raised by wolves and was fierce and dangerous

2:33:44.860 --> 2:33:48.780
 and who cannot be socialized because she cannot be tamed.

2:33:48.780 --> 2:33:50.460
 You cannot be part of human society.

2:33:50.460 --> 2:33:51.900
 And you see human society,

2:33:51.900 --> 2:33:53.700
 it's something that is very, very complicated.

2:33:53.700 --> 2:33:57.780
 You see people extracting resources and destroying nature.

2:33:57.780 --> 2:34:00.740
 But the purpose is not to be evil,

2:34:00.740 --> 2:34:04.740
 but to be able to have a life that is free from,

2:34:04.740 --> 2:34:07.140
 for instance, oppression and violence

2:34:07.140 --> 2:34:10.860
 and to curb death and disease.

2:34:10.860 --> 2:34:13.260
 And you basically see this conflict

2:34:13.260 --> 2:34:15.180
 which cannot be resolved in a certain way.

2:34:15.180 --> 2:34:18.340
 You see this moment when nature is turned into a garden

2:34:18.340 --> 2:34:20.980
 and it loses most of what it actually is

2:34:20.980 --> 2:34:23.420
 and humans no longer submitting to life and death

2:34:23.420 --> 2:34:26.820
 and nature and to these questions, there is no easy answer.

2:34:26.820 --> 2:34:29.980
 So it just turns it into something that is being observed

2:34:29.980 --> 2:34:31.180
 as a journey that happens.

2:34:31.180 --> 2:34:34.940
 And that happens with a certain degree of inevitability.

2:34:34.940 --> 2:34:37.100
 And the nice thing about all his movies

2:34:37.100 --> 2:34:38.740
 is there's a certain main character

2:34:38.740 --> 2:34:41.260
 and it's the same in all movies.

2:34:41.260 --> 2:34:45.740
 It's this little girl that is basically Heidi.

2:34:45.740 --> 2:34:50.540
 And I suspect that happened because when he did field work

2:34:50.540 --> 2:34:53.020
 for working on the Heidi movies back then,

2:34:53.020 --> 2:34:55.700
 the Heidi animations, before he did his own movies,

2:34:55.700 --> 2:35:00.220
 he traveled to Switzerland and South Eastern Europe

2:35:00.220 --> 2:35:03.220
 and the Adriatic and so on and got an idea

2:35:03.220 --> 2:35:05.340
 about a certain aesthetic and a certain way of life

2:35:05.340 --> 2:35:08.140
 that informed his future thinking.

2:35:08.140 --> 2:35:11.020
 And Heidi has a very interesting relationship

2:35:11.020 --> 2:35:13.300
 to herself and to the world.

2:35:13.300 --> 2:35:15.940
 There's nothing that she takes for herself.

2:35:15.940 --> 2:35:18.780
 She's in a way fearless because she is committed

2:35:18.780 --> 2:35:20.860
 to a service, to a greater whole.

2:35:20.860 --> 2:35:24.100
 Basically, she is completely committed to serving God.

2:35:24.100 --> 2:35:26.300
 And it's not an institutionalized God.

2:35:26.300 --> 2:35:28.500
 It has nothing to do with the Roman Catholic Church

2:35:28.500 --> 2:35:30.420
 or something like this.

2:35:30.420 --> 2:35:32.660
 But in some sense, Heidi is an embodiment

2:35:32.660 --> 2:35:34.940
 of the spirit of European Protestantism.

2:35:35.780 --> 2:35:38.780
 It's this idea of a being that is completely perfect

2:35:38.780 --> 2:35:40.180
 and pure.

2:35:40.180 --> 2:35:42.060
 And it's not a feminist vision

2:35:42.060 --> 2:35:47.060
 because she is not a girl boss or something like this.

2:35:48.620 --> 2:35:52.460
 She is the justification for the men in the audience

2:35:52.460 --> 2:35:54.780
 to protect her, to build a civilization around her

2:35:54.780 --> 2:35:56.580
 that makes her possible.

2:35:56.580 --> 2:35:59.260
 So she is not just the sacrifice of Jesus

2:35:59.260 --> 2:36:02.740
 who is innocent and therefore nailed to the cross.

2:36:02.740 --> 2:36:04.060
 She is not being sacrificed.

2:36:04.060 --> 2:36:07.020
 She is being protected by everybody around her

2:36:07.020 --> 2:36:08.620
 who recognizes that she is sacred.

2:36:08.620 --> 2:36:12.060
 And there are enough around her to see that.

2:36:12.060 --> 2:36:14.020
 So this is a very interesting perspective.

2:36:14.020 --> 2:36:16.340
 There's a certain notion of innocence.

2:36:16.340 --> 2:36:18.500
 And this notion of innocence is not universal.

2:36:18.500 --> 2:36:20.140
 It's not in all cultures.

2:36:20.140 --> 2:36:21.500
 Hitler wasn't innocent.

2:36:21.500 --> 2:36:25.620
 His idea of Germany was not that there is an innocence

2:36:25.620 --> 2:36:26.900
 that is being protected.

2:36:26.900 --> 2:36:29.700
 There was a predator that was going to triumph.

2:36:29.700 --> 2:36:31.420
 And it's also something that is not at the core

2:36:31.420 --> 2:36:32.260
 of every religion.

2:36:32.260 --> 2:36:34.860
 There are many religions which don't care about innocence.

2:36:34.860 --> 2:36:39.860
 They might care about increasing the status of something.

2:36:41.020 --> 2:36:44.980
 And that's a very interesting notion that is quite unique

2:36:44.980 --> 2:36:47.620
 and not claiming it's the optimal one.

2:36:47.620 --> 2:36:49.940
 It's just a particular kind of aesthetic

2:36:49.940 --> 2:36:51.780
 which I think makes Miyazaki

2:36:51.780 --> 2:36:55.500
 into the most relevant Protestant philosopher today.

2:36:55.500 --> 2:36:59.780
 And you're saying in terms of all the ways

2:36:59.780 --> 2:37:02.020
 that a society can operate perhaps the preservation

2:37:02.020 --> 2:37:07.020
 of innocence might be one of the best.

2:37:07.140 --> 2:37:09.780
 No, it's just my aesthetic.

2:37:09.780 --> 2:37:13.620
 So it's a particular way in which I feel

2:37:13.620 --> 2:37:15.420
 that I relate to the world that is natural

2:37:15.420 --> 2:37:16.700
 to my own socialization.

2:37:16.700 --> 2:37:18.300
 And maybe it's not an accident

2:37:18.300 --> 2:37:21.140
 that I have cultural roots in Europe

2:37:22.380 --> 2:37:23.380
 in a particular world.

2:37:23.380 --> 2:37:26.620
 And so maybe it's a natural convergence point

2:37:26.620 --> 2:37:28.500
 and it's not something that you will find

2:37:28.500 --> 2:37:30.980
 in all other times in history.

2:37:30.980 --> 2:37:33.980
 So I'd like to ask you about Solzhenitsyn

2:37:33.980 --> 2:37:38.980
 and our individual role as ants in this very large society.

2:37:39.460 --> 2:37:42.060
 So he says that some version of the line

2:37:42.060 --> 2:37:44.700
 between good and evil runs to the heart of every man.

2:37:44.700 --> 2:37:47.340
 Do you think all of us are capable of good and evil?

2:37:47.340 --> 2:37:50.820
 Like what's our role in this play

2:37:53.500 --> 2:37:55.580
 in this game we're all playing?

2:37:55.580 --> 2:37:57.940
 Is all of us capable to play any role?

2:37:59.020 --> 2:38:00.980
 Like, is there an ultimate responsibility

2:38:00.980 --> 2:38:04.300
 to you mentioned maintaining innocence

2:38:04.300 --> 2:38:09.140
 or whatever the highest ideal for a society you want

2:38:09.140 --> 2:38:11.540
 are all of us capable of living up to that?

2:38:11.540 --> 2:38:13.340
 And that's our responsibility

2:38:13.340 --> 2:38:15.900
 or is there significant limitations

2:38:15.900 --> 2:38:18.780
 to what we're able to do in terms of good and evil?

2:38:21.340 --> 2:38:24.060
 So there is a certain way if you are not terrible,

2:38:24.060 --> 2:38:29.060
 if you are committed to some kind of civilizational agency,

2:38:29.460 --> 2:38:31.140
 a next level agent that you are serving,

2:38:31.140 --> 2:38:33.140
 some kind of transcendent principle.

2:38:34.260 --> 2:38:36.300
 In the eyes of that transcendental principle,

2:38:36.300 --> 2:38:38.060
 you are able to discern good from evil.

2:38:38.060 --> 2:38:39.020
 Otherwise you cannot,

2:38:39.020 --> 2:38:41.660
 otherwise you have just individual aesthetics.

2:38:41.660 --> 2:38:44.060
 The cat that is torturing a mouse is not evil

2:38:44.060 --> 2:38:46.340
 because the cat does not envision

2:38:46.340 --> 2:38:50.660
 or no part of the world of the cat is envisioning a world

2:38:50.660 --> 2:38:53.740
 where there is no violence and nobody is suffering.

2:38:53.740 --> 2:38:55.500
 If you have an aesthetic where you want

2:38:55.500 --> 2:38:56.940
 to protect innocence,

2:38:56.940 --> 2:39:00.020
 then torturing somebody needlessly is evil,

2:39:00.900 --> 2:39:01.900
 but only then.

2:39:02.740 --> 2:39:05.660
 No, but within, I guess the question is within the aesthetic,

2:39:05.660 --> 2:39:10.260
 like within your sense of what is good and evil,

2:39:10.260 --> 2:39:14.460
 are we still, it seems like we're still able

2:39:14.460 --> 2:39:17.140
 to commit evil.

2:39:17.140 --> 2:39:19.340
 Yes, so basically if you are committing

2:39:19.340 --> 2:39:20.820
 to this next level agent,

2:39:20.820 --> 2:39:23.580
 you are not necessarily are this next level agent, right?

2:39:23.580 --> 2:39:24.420
 You are a part of it.

2:39:24.420 --> 2:39:26.020
 You have a relationship to it,

2:39:26.020 --> 2:39:29.700
 like the cell does to its organism, its hyperorganism.

2:39:29.700 --> 2:39:31.340
 And it only exists to the degree

2:39:31.340 --> 2:39:34.580
 that it's being implemented by you and others.

2:39:34.580 --> 2:39:38.540
 And that means that you're not completely fully serving it.

2:39:38.540 --> 2:39:40.340
 You have freedom in what you decide,

2:39:40.340 --> 2:39:42.100
 whether you are acting on your impulses

2:39:42.100 --> 2:39:44.500
 and local incentives and your farewell impulses,

2:39:44.500 --> 2:39:47.140
 so to speak, or whether you're committing to it.

2:39:47.140 --> 2:39:49.980
 And what you perceive then is a tension

2:39:49.980 --> 2:39:53.100
 between what you would be doing with respect

2:39:53.100 --> 2:39:57.300
 to the thing that you recognize as the sacred, if you do,

2:39:57.300 --> 2:39:58.820
 and what you're actually doing.

2:39:58.820 --> 2:40:01.460
 And this is the line between good and evil,

2:40:01.460 --> 2:40:03.100
 right where you see, oh, I'm here acting

2:40:03.100 --> 2:40:05.700
 on my local incentives or impulses,

2:40:05.700 --> 2:40:08.100
 and here I'm acting on what I consider to be sacred.

2:40:08.100 --> 2:40:09.780
 And there's a tension between those.

2:40:09.780 --> 2:40:11.940
 And this is the line between good and evil

2:40:11.940 --> 2:40:14.380
 that might run through your heart.

2:40:14.380 --> 2:40:15.700
 And if you don't have that,

2:40:15.700 --> 2:40:17.180
 if you don't have this relationship

2:40:17.180 --> 2:40:18.660
 to a transcendental agent,

2:40:18.660 --> 2:40:19.980
 you could call this relationship

2:40:19.980 --> 2:40:21.700
 to the next level agent soul, right?

2:40:21.700 --> 2:40:22.540
 It's not a thing.

2:40:22.540 --> 2:40:25.780
 It's not an immortal thing that is intrinsically valuable.

2:40:25.780 --> 2:40:27.460
 It's a certain kind of relationship

2:40:27.460 --> 2:40:29.580
 that you project to understand what's happening.

2:40:29.580 --> 2:40:31.900
 Somebody is serving this transcendental sacredness

2:40:31.900 --> 2:40:33.220
 or they're not.

2:40:33.220 --> 2:40:35.860
 If you don't have a soul, you cannot be evil.

2:40:35.860 --> 2:40:39.620
 You're just a complex natural phenomenon.

2:40:39.620 --> 2:40:42.140
 So if you look at life, like starting today

2:40:42.140 --> 2:40:45.140
 or starting tomorrow, when we leave here today,

2:40:46.020 --> 2:40:48.180
 there's a bunch of trajectories

2:40:48.180 --> 2:40:53.180
 that you can take through life, maybe countless.

2:40:53.780 --> 2:40:57.300
 Do you think some of these trajectories,

2:40:57.300 --> 2:40:59.700
 in your own conception of yourself,

2:40:59.700 --> 2:41:04.220
 some of those trajectories are the ideal life,

2:41:04.220 --> 2:41:09.220
 a life that if you were to be the hero of your life story,

2:41:09.620 --> 2:41:10.860
 you would want to be?

2:41:10.860 --> 2:41:14.500
 Like, is there some Josh or Bhakti you're striving to be?

2:41:14.500 --> 2:41:15.980
 Like, this is the question I ask myself

2:41:15.980 --> 2:41:20.260
 as an individual trying to make a better world

2:41:20.260 --> 2:41:22.540
 in the best way that I could conceive of.

2:41:22.540 --> 2:41:24.660
 What is my responsibility there?

2:41:24.660 --> 2:41:28.260
 And how much am I responsible for the failure to do so?

2:41:28.260 --> 2:41:33.260
 Because I'm lazy and incompetent too often.

2:41:33.260 --> 2:41:35.740
 In my own perception.

2:41:35.740 --> 2:41:38.260
 In my own worldview, I'm not very important.

2:41:38.260 --> 2:41:41.540
 So it's, I don't have place for me as a hero

2:41:41.540 --> 2:41:42.460
 in my own world.

2:41:43.460 --> 2:41:45.980
 I'm trying to do the best that I can,

2:41:45.980 --> 2:41:48.060
 which is often not very good.

2:41:48.060 --> 2:41:52.820
 And so it's not important for me to have status

2:41:52.820 --> 2:41:55.500
 or to be seen in a particular way.

2:41:55.500 --> 2:41:57.380
 It's helpful if others can see me

2:41:57.380 --> 2:41:59.780
 or a few people can see me that can be my friends.

2:41:59.780 --> 2:42:01.460
 No, sorry, I want to clarify,

2:42:01.460 --> 2:42:05.220
 the hero I didn't mean status or perception

2:42:05.220 --> 2:42:09.660
 or like some kind of marketing thing,

2:42:09.660 --> 2:42:13.180
 but more in private, in the quiet of your own mind.

2:42:14.060 --> 2:42:15.980
 Is there the kind of man you want to be

2:42:16.940 --> 2:42:20.460
 and would consider it a failure if you don't become that?

2:42:20.460 --> 2:42:21.940
 That's what I meant by hero.

2:42:21.940 --> 2:42:23.300
 Yeah, not really.

2:42:23.300 --> 2:42:26.140
 I don't perceive myself as having such an identity.

2:42:26.140 --> 2:42:30.420
 And it's also sometimes frustrating,

2:42:32.340 --> 2:42:37.340
 but it's basically a lack of having this notion

2:42:37.940 --> 2:42:40.620
 of father that I need to be emulating.

2:42:44.020 --> 2:42:44.980
 It's interesting.

2:42:44.980 --> 2:42:47.220
 I mean, it's the leaf floating down the river.

2:42:48.660 --> 2:42:50.220
 I worry that...

2:42:50.220 --> 2:42:55.220
 Sometimes it's more like being the river.

2:42:59.020 --> 2:43:02.740
 I'm just a fat frog sitting on a leaf

2:43:02.740 --> 2:43:06.620
 on a dirty, muddy lake.

2:43:06.620 --> 2:43:11.620
 I wish I was waiting for a princess to kiss me.

2:43:13.540 --> 2:43:15.780
 Or the other way, I forgot which way it goes.

2:43:15.780 --> 2:43:17.180
 Somebody kisses somebody.

2:43:17.180 --> 2:43:20.420
 I can ask you, I don't know if you know

2:43:20.420 --> 2:43:21.700
 who Michael Malice is,

2:43:21.700 --> 2:43:26.700
 but in terms of constructing since systems of incentives,

2:43:27.060 --> 2:43:29.540
 it's interesting to ask.

2:43:29.540 --> 2:43:32.140
 I don't think I've talked to you about this before.

2:43:33.060 --> 2:43:35.700
 Malice espouses anarchism.

2:43:35.700 --> 2:43:38.460
 So he sees all government as fundamentally

2:43:40.660 --> 2:43:42.940
 getting in the way or even being destructive

2:43:42.940 --> 2:43:47.940
 to collaborations between human beings thriving.

2:43:49.660 --> 2:43:50.500
 What do you think?

2:43:50.500 --> 2:43:55.500
 What's the role of government in a society that thrives?

2:43:56.900 --> 2:44:00.580
 Is anarchism at all compelling to you as a system?

2:44:00.580 --> 2:44:02.980
 So like not just small government,

2:44:02.980 --> 2:44:04.340
 but no government at all.

2:44:05.940 --> 2:44:07.940
 Yeah, I don't see how this would work.

2:44:09.860 --> 2:44:12.700
 The government is an agent that imposes an offset

2:44:12.700 --> 2:44:15.580
 on your reward function, on your payout metrics.

2:44:15.580 --> 2:44:19.500
 So your behavior becomes compatible with the common good.

2:44:20.860 --> 2:44:25.620
 So the argument there is that you can have collectives

2:44:25.620 --> 2:44:28.620
 like governing organizations, but not government,

2:44:28.620 --> 2:44:32.540
 like where you're born in a particular set of land

2:44:32.540 --> 2:44:37.540
 and therefore you must follow this rule or else.

2:44:38.420 --> 2:44:41.820
 You're forced by what they call violence

2:44:41.820 --> 2:44:44.900
 because there's an implied violence here.

2:44:44.900 --> 2:44:49.900
 So the key aspect of government is it protects you

2:44:52.020 --> 2:44:56.700
 from the rest of the world with an army and with police.

2:44:56.700 --> 2:45:00.020
 So it has a monopoly on violence.

2:45:00.020 --> 2:45:02.060
 It's the only one that's able to do violence.

2:45:02.060 --> 2:45:03.540
 So there are many forms of government,

2:45:03.540 --> 2:45:05.020
 not all governments do that.

2:45:05.020 --> 2:45:09.660
 But we find that in successful countries,

2:45:09.660 --> 2:45:11.860
 the government has a monopoly on violence.

2:45:12.740 --> 2:45:15.700
 And that means that you cannot get ahead

2:45:15.700 --> 2:45:17.740
 by starting your own army because the government

2:45:17.740 --> 2:45:19.340
 will come down on you and destroy you

2:45:19.340 --> 2:45:20.940
 if you try to do that.

2:45:20.940 --> 2:45:23.260
 And in countries where you can build your own army

2:45:23.260 --> 2:45:25.700
 and get away with it, some people will do it.

2:45:25.700 --> 2:45:28.580
 And these countries is what we call failed countries

2:45:28.580 --> 2:45:30.060
 in a way.

2:45:30.060 --> 2:45:33.500
 And if you don't want to have violence,

2:45:33.500 --> 2:45:36.860
 the point is not to appeal to the moral intentions of people

2:45:36.860 --> 2:45:39.180
 because some people will use strategies

2:45:39.180 --> 2:45:41.820
 if they get ahead with them that feel a particular kind

2:45:41.820 --> 2:45:42.740
 of ecological niche.

2:45:42.740 --> 2:45:45.260
 So you need to destroy that ecological niche.

2:45:45.260 --> 2:45:50.060
 And if effective government has a monopoly on violence,

2:45:50.060 --> 2:45:53.460
 it can create a world where nobody is able to use violence

2:45:53.460 --> 2:45:54.820
 and get ahead.

2:45:54.820 --> 2:45:57.060
 So you want to use that monopoly on violence,

2:45:57.060 --> 2:46:00.100
 not to exert violence, but to make violence impossible,

2:46:00.100 --> 2:46:02.140
 to raise the cost of violence.

2:46:02.140 --> 2:46:06.100
 So people need to get ahead with nonviolent means.

2:46:06.100 --> 2:46:09.300
 So the idea is that you might be able to achieve that

2:46:09.300 --> 2:46:12.220
 in an anarchist state with companies.

2:46:12.220 --> 2:46:17.220
 So with the forces of capitalism is create security companies

2:46:18.260 --> 2:46:21.980
 where the one that's most ethically sound rises to the top.

2:46:21.980 --> 2:46:24.220
 Basically, it would be a much better representative

2:46:24.220 --> 2:46:29.220
 of the people because there is a less sort of stickiness

2:46:29.220 --> 2:46:33.220
 to the big military force sticking around

2:46:33.220 --> 2:46:36.420
 even though it's long overlived, outlived.

2:46:36.420 --> 2:46:40.060
 So you have groups of militants that are hopefully

2:46:40.060 --> 2:46:41.940
 efficiently organized because otherwise they're going

2:46:41.940 --> 2:46:44.580
 to lose against the other groups of militants

2:46:44.580 --> 2:46:47.060
 and they are coordinating themselves with the rest

2:46:47.060 --> 2:46:51.220
 of society until they are having a monopoly on violence.

2:46:51.220 --> 2:46:53.940
 How is that different from a government?

2:46:53.940 --> 2:46:56.220
 So it's basically converging to the same thing.

2:46:56.220 --> 2:47:00.020
 So I was trying to argue with Malice,

2:47:00.020 --> 2:47:03.060
 I feel like it always converges towards government at scale,

2:47:03.060 --> 2:47:06.100
 but I think the idea is you can have a lot of collectives

2:47:06.100 --> 2:47:11.100
 that are, you basically never let anything scale too big.

2:47:11.820 --> 2:47:15.460
 So one of the problems with governments is it gets too big

2:47:15.460 --> 2:47:19.820
 in terms of like the size of the group

2:47:19.820 --> 2:47:21.540
 over which it has control.

2:47:23.980 --> 2:47:25.940
 My sense is that would happen anyway.

2:47:27.060 --> 2:47:30.660
 So a successful company like Amazon or Facebook,

2:47:30.660 --> 2:47:33.060
 I mean, it starts forming a monopoly

2:47:33.060 --> 2:47:36.060
 over the entire populations,

2:47:36.060 --> 2:47:37.900
 not over just the hundreds of millions,

2:47:37.900 --> 2:47:39.340
 but billions of people.

2:47:39.340 --> 2:47:43.540
 So I don't know, but there is something

2:47:43.540 --> 2:47:46.060
 about the abuses of power the government can have

2:47:46.060 --> 2:47:49.020
 when it has a monopoly on violence, right?

2:47:49.020 --> 2:47:53.020
 And so that's a tension there, but...

2:47:53.020 --> 2:47:55.180
 So the question is how can you set the incentives

2:47:55.180 --> 2:47:56.420
 for government correctly?

2:47:56.420 --> 2:47:59.940
 And this mostly applies at the highest levels of government

2:47:59.940 --> 2:48:02.940
 and because we haven't found a way to set them correctly,

2:48:02.940 --> 2:48:06.300
 we made the highest levels of government relatively weak.

2:48:06.300 --> 2:48:08.580
 And this is, I think, part of the reason

2:48:08.580 --> 2:48:12.260
 why we had difficulty to coordinate the pandemic response

2:48:12.260 --> 2:48:14.940
 and China didn't have that much difficulty.

2:48:14.940 --> 2:48:17.500
 And there is, of course, a much higher risk

2:48:17.500 --> 2:48:19.980
 of the abuse of power that exists in China

2:48:19.980 --> 2:48:22.740
 because the power is largely unchecked.

2:48:22.740 --> 2:48:25.260
 And that's basically what happens

2:48:25.260 --> 2:48:26.540
 in the next generation, for instance.

2:48:26.540 --> 2:48:28.380
 Imagine that we would agree

2:48:28.380 --> 2:48:30.460
 that the current government of China is largely correct

2:48:30.460 --> 2:48:33.180
 and benevolent, and maybe we don't agree on this,

2:48:33.180 --> 2:48:36.100
 but if we did, how can we make sure

2:48:36.100 --> 2:48:37.540
 that this stays like this?

2:48:37.540 --> 2:48:40.300
 And if you don't have checks and balances,

2:48:40.300 --> 2:48:42.980
 division of power, it's hard to achieve.

2:48:42.980 --> 2:48:45.300
 You don't have a solution for that problem.

2:48:45.300 --> 2:48:47.420
 But the abolishment of government

2:48:47.420 --> 2:48:49.540
 basically would remove the control structure.

2:48:49.540 --> 2:48:51.540
 From a cybernetic perspective,

2:48:51.540 --> 2:48:54.740
 there is an optimal point in the system

2:48:54.740 --> 2:48:56.460
 that the regulation should be happening, right?

2:48:56.460 --> 2:48:59.780
 That you can measure the current incentives

2:48:59.780 --> 2:49:01.940
 and the regulator would be properly incentivized

2:49:01.940 --> 2:49:03.740
 to make the right decisions

2:49:03.740 --> 2:49:06.340
 and change the payout metrics of everything below it

2:49:06.340 --> 2:49:08.620
 in such a way that the local prisoners dilemmas

2:49:08.620 --> 2:49:09.900
 get resolved, right?

2:49:09.900 --> 2:49:12.060
 You cannot resolve the prisoners dilemma

2:49:12.060 --> 2:49:14.100
 without some kind of eternal control

2:49:14.900 --> 2:49:17.300
 that emulates an infinite game in a way.

2:49:19.060 --> 2:49:22.380
 Yeah, I mean, there's a sense in which

2:49:22.380 --> 2:49:24.940
 it seems like the reason government,

2:49:24.940 --> 2:49:27.780
 the parts of government that don't work well currently

2:49:27.780 --> 2:49:32.020
 is because there's not good mechanisms

2:49:34.020 --> 2:49:35.380
 through which to interact,

2:49:35.380 --> 2:49:37.300
 for the citizenry to interact with government

2:49:37.300 --> 2:49:41.500
 is basically it hasn't caught up in terms of technology.

2:49:41.500 --> 2:49:43.860
 And I think once you integrate

2:49:43.860 --> 2:49:46.100
 some of the digital revolution

2:49:46.100 --> 2:49:48.420
 of being able to have a lot of access to data,

2:49:48.420 --> 2:49:52.060
 be able to vote on different ideas at a local level,

2:49:52.060 --> 2:49:54.780
 at all levels, at the optimal level

2:49:54.780 --> 2:49:58.580
 like you're saying that can resolve the prisoner dilemmas

2:49:58.580 --> 2:50:01.380
 and to integrate AI to help you automate things

2:50:01.380 --> 2:50:06.220
 that don't require the human ingenuity.

2:50:07.460 --> 2:50:10.340
 I feel like that's where government could operate that well

2:50:10.340 --> 2:50:14.620
 and can also break apart the inefficient bureaucracies

2:50:14.620 --> 2:50:15.460
 if needed.

2:50:15.460 --> 2:50:20.460
 There'll be a strong incentive to be efficient and successful.

2:50:20.620 --> 2:50:23.020
 So out human history, we see an evolution

2:50:23.020 --> 2:50:25.660
 and evolutionary competition of modes of government

2:50:25.660 --> 2:50:28.180
 and of individual governments is in these modes.

2:50:28.180 --> 2:50:29.900
 And every nation state in some sense

2:50:29.900 --> 2:50:33.180
 is some kind of organism that has found different solutions

2:50:33.180 --> 2:50:34.980
 for the problem of government.

2:50:34.980 --> 2:50:37.500
 And you could look at all these different models

2:50:37.500 --> 2:50:39.420
 and the different scales at which it exists

2:50:39.420 --> 2:50:43.020
 as empirical attempts to validate the idea

2:50:43.020 --> 2:50:45.780
 of how to build a better government.

2:50:45.780 --> 2:50:49.180
 And I suspect that the idea of anarchism

2:50:49.180 --> 2:50:51.900
 similar to the idea of communism

2:50:51.900 --> 2:50:54.860
 is the result of being disenchanted

2:50:54.860 --> 2:50:57.340
 with the ugliness of the real existing solutions

2:50:57.340 --> 2:51:00.980
 and the attempt to get to an utopia.

2:51:00.980 --> 2:51:04.540
 And I suspect that communism originally was not a utopia.

2:51:04.540 --> 2:51:07.580
 I think that in the same way as original Christianity,

2:51:07.580 --> 2:51:10.020
 it had a particular kind of vision.

2:51:10.020 --> 2:51:12.540
 And this vision is a society,

2:51:12.540 --> 2:51:15.300
 a mode of organization within the society

2:51:15.300 --> 2:51:20.300
 in which humans can coexist at scale without coercion.

2:51:20.300 --> 2:51:23.660
 In the same way as we do in a healthy family, right?

2:51:23.660 --> 2:51:24.500
 In a good family,

2:51:24.500 --> 2:51:28.060
 you don't terrorize each other into compliance,

2:51:28.060 --> 2:51:30.300
 but you understand what everybody needs

2:51:30.300 --> 2:51:32.220
 and what everybody is able to contribute

2:51:32.220 --> 2:51:35.260
 and what the intended future of the whole thing is.

2:51:35.260 --> 2:51:38.380
 And everybody coordinates their behavior in the right way

2:51:38.380 --> 2:51:40.820
 and informs each other about how to do this.

2:51:40.820 --> 2:51:42.540
 And all the interactions that happen

2:51:42.540 --> 2:51:45.820
 are instrumental to making that happen, right?

2:51:45.820 --> 2:51:47.260
 Could this happen at scale?

2:51:47.260 --> 2:51:49.180
 And I think this is the idea of communism.

2:51:49.180 --> 2:51:51.420
 Communism is opposed to the idea

2:51:51.420 --> 2:51:53.340
 that we need economic terror

2:51:53.340 --> 2:51:55.700
 or other forms of terror to make that happen.

2:51:55.700 --> 2:51:56.860
 But in practice, what happened

2:51:56.860 --> 2:51:59.300
 is that the proto communist countries,

2:51:59.300 --> 2:52:01.140
 the real existing socialism,

2:52:01.140 --> 2:52:04.620
 replaced a part of the economic terror with moral terror,

2:52:04.620 --> 2:52:05.460
 right?

2:52:05.460 --> 2:52:07.540
 So we were told to do the right thing for moral reasons.

2:52:07.540 --> 2:52:09.180
 And of course it didn't really work

2:52:09.180 --> 2:52:11.620
 and the economy eventually collapsed.

2:52:11.620 --> 2:52:14.540
 And the moral terror had actual real cost, right?

2:52:14.540 --> 2:52:15.820
 People were in prison

2:52:15.820 --> 2:52:17.820
 because they were morally noncompliant.

2:52:17.820 --> 2:52:22.820
 And the other thing is that the idea of communism

2:52:22.900 --> 2:52:24.060
 became a utopia.

2:52:24.060 --> 2:52:26.140
 So it basically was projected into the afterlife.

2:52:26.140 --> 2:52:28.660
 We were told in my childhood

2:52:28.660 --> 2:52:31.220
 that communism was a hypothetical society

2:52:31.220 --> 2:52:33.380
 to which we were in a permanent revolution

2:52:33.380 --> 2:52:34.660
 that justified everything

2:52:34.660 --> 2:52:37.500
 that was presently wrong with society morally.

2:52:37.500 --> 2:52:39.540
 But it was something that our grandchildren

2:52:39.540 --> 2:52:41.140
 probably would not ever see

2:52:41.140 --> 2:52:43.860
 because it was too ideal and too far in the future

2:52:43.860 --> 2:52:44.980
 to make it happen right now.

2:52:44.980 --> 2:52:47.300
 And people were just not there yet morally.

2:52:47.300 --> 2:52:50.300
 And the same thing happened with Christianity, right?

2:52:50.300 --> 2:52:52.820
 This notion of heaven was mythologized

2:52:52.820 --> 2:52:54.380
 and projected into an afterlife.

2:52:54.380 --> 2:52:56.900
 And I think this was just the idea of God's kingdom

2:52:56.900 --> 2:52:59.180
 of this world in which we instantiate

2:52:59.180 --> 2:53:01.980
 the next level transcendental agent in the perfect form.

2:53:01.980 --> 2:53:04.660
 So everything goes smoothly and without violence

2:53:04.660 --> 2:53:07.980
 and without conflict and without this human messiness

2:53:07.980 --> 2:53:11.340
 on this economic messiness and the terror and coercion

2:53:11.340 --> 2:53:13.820
 that existed in the present societies.

2:53:13.820 --> 2:53:16.980
 And the idea of that the humans can exist at some point

2:53:16.980 --> 2:53:20.180
 exist at scale in a harmonious way and noncoercively

2:53:20.180 --> 2:53:21.700
 is untested, right?

2:53:21.700 --> 2:53:23.140
 A lot of people tested it

2:53:23.140 --> 2:53:25.340
 but didn't get it to work so far.

2:53:25.340 --> 2:53:27.740
 And the utopia is a world in where you get

2:53:27.740 --> 2:53:30.900
 all the good things without any of the bad things.

2:53:30.900 --> 2:53:34.500
 And you are, I think very susceptible to believe in utopias

2:53:34.500 --> 2:53:36.860
 when you are very young and don't understand

2:53:36.860 --> 2:53:39.580
 that everything has to happen in causal patterns,

2:53:39.580 --> 2:53:40.940
 that there's always feedback loops

2:53:40.940 --> 2:53:42.620
 that ultimately are closed.

2:53:42.620 --> 2:53:44.020
 There's nothing that just happens

2:53:44.020 --> 2:53:45.460
 because it's good or bad.

2:53:45.460 --> 2:53:47.220
 Good or bad don't exist in isolation.

2:53:47.220 --> 2:53:50.660
 They only exist with respect to larger systems.

2:53:50.660 --> 2:53:55.660
 So can you intuit why utopias fail as systems?

2:53:57.780 --> 2:54:01.620
 So like having a utopia that's out there beyond the horizon

2:54:01.620 --> 2:54:02.900
 is it because then,

2:54:04.980 --> 2:54:08.220
 it's not only because it's impossible to achieve utopias

2:54:08.220 --> 2:54:11.940
 but it's because what certain humans,

2:54:11.940 --> 2:54:16.940
 certain small number of humans start to sort of greedily

2:54:20.220 --> 2:54:25.220
 attain power and money and control and influence

2:54:25.540 --> 2:54:27.260
 as they become,

2:54:28.980 --> 2:54:33.980
 as they see the power in using this idea of a utopia

2:54:34.420 --> 2:54:35.260
 for propaganda.

2:54:35.260 --> 2:54:37.260
 It's a bit like saying, why is my garden not perfect?

2:54:37.260 --> 2:54:39.780
 It's because some evil weeds are overgrowing it

2:54:39.780 --> 2:54:41.540
 and they always do, right?

2:54:41.540 --> 2:54:43.220
 But this is not how it works.

2:54:43.220 --> 2:54:45.420
 A good garden is a system that is in balance

2:54:45.420 --> 2:54:48.620
 and requires minimal interactions by the gardener.

2:54:48.620 --> 2:54:51.860
 And so you need to create a system

2:54:51.860 --> 2:54:54.220
 that is designed to self stabilize.

2:54:54.220 --> 2:54:55.860
 And the design of social systems

2:54:55.860 --> 2:54:57.500
 requires not just the implementation

2:54:57.500 --> 2:54:58.780
 of the desired functionality,

2:54:58.780 --> 2:55:01.820
 but the next level design, also in biological systems.

2:55:01.820 --> 2:55:04.140
 You need to create a system that wants to converge

2:55:04.140 --> 2:55:06.100
 to the intended function.

2:55:06.100 --> 2:55:09.380
 And so instead of just creating an institution like the FDA

2:55:09.380 --> 2:55:13.180
 that is performing a particular kind of role in society,

2:55:13.180 --> 2:55:15.780
 you need to make sure that the FDA is actually driven

2:55:15.780 --> 2:55:18.180
 by a system that wants to do this optimally,

2:55:18.180 --> 2:55:19.860
 that is incentivized to do it optimally

2:55:19.860 --> 2:55:23.340
 and then makes the performance that is actually enacted

2:55:23.340 --> 2:55:26.220
 in every generation instrumental to that thing,

2:55:26.220 --> 2:55:27.660
 that actual goal, right?

2:55:27.660 --> 2:55:30.100
 And that is much harder to design and to achieve.

2:55:30.100 --> 2:55:32.460
 See if the design a system where,

2:55:32.460 --> 2:55:36.940
 and listen communism also was quote unquote incentivized

2:55:36.940 --> 2:55:41.940
 to be a feedback loop system that achieves that utopia.

2:55:43.500 --> 2:55:45.820
 It's just, it wasn't working given human nature.

2:55:45.820 --> 2:55:47.980
 The incentives were not correct given human nature.

2:55:47.980 --> 2:55:50.460
 How do you incentivize people

2:55:50.460 --> 2:55:52.340
 when they are getting coal off the ground

2:55:52.340 --> 2:55:53.900
 to work as hard as possible?

2:55:53.900 --> 2:55:55.540
 Because it's a terrible job

2:55:55.540 --> 2:55:57.060
 and it's very bad for your health.

2:55:57.060 --> 2:55:59.540
 And right, how do you do this?

2:55:59.540 --> 2:56:03.620
 And you can give them prices and medals and status

2:56:03.620 --> 2:56:04.580
 to some degree, right?

2:56:04.580 --> 2:56:06.900
 There's only so much status to give for that.

2:56:06.900 --> 2:56:09.340
 And most people will not fall for this, right?

2:56:09.340 --> 2:56:12.940
 Or you can pay them and you probably have to pay them

2:56:12.940 --> 2:56:15.700
 in an asymmetric way because if you pay everybody the same

2:56:15.700 --> 2:56:19.100
 and you nationalize the coal mines,

2:56:19.100 --> 2:56:20.620
 eventually people will figure out

2:56:20.620 --> 2:56:21.940
 that they can game the system.

2:56:21.940 --> 2:56:25.820
 Yes, so you're describing capitalism.

2:56:25.820 --> 2:56:28.620
 So capitalism is the present solution to the system.

2:56:28.620 --> 2:56:32.140
 And what we also noticed that I think that Marx was correct

2:56:32.140 --> 2:56:35.140
 in saying that capitalism is prone to crisis,

2:56:35.140 --> 2:56:38.460
 that capitalism is a system that in its dynamics

2:56:38.460 --> 2:56:40.780
 is not convergent, but divergent.

2:56:40.780 --> 2:56:42.860
 It's not a stable system.

2:56:42.860 --> 2:56:47.380
 And that eventually it produces an enormous potential

2:56:47.380 --> 2:56:50.820
 for productivity, but it also is systematically

2:56:50.820 --> 2:56:52.140
 misallocating resources.

2:56:52.140 --> 2:56:54.700
 So a lot of people cannot participate

2:56:54.700 --> 2:56:57.300
 in the production and consumption anymore, right?

2:56:57.300 --> 2:56:58.420
 And this is what we observed.

2:56:58.420 --> 2:57:01.460
 We observed that the middle class in the US is tiny.

2:57:01.460 --> 2:57:05.500
 It's a lot of people think that they're middle class,

2:57:05.500 --> 2:57:07.460
 but if you are still flying economy,

2:57:07.460 --> 2:57:11.660
 you're not middle class, right?

2:57:11.660 --> 2:57:14.700
 Every class is a magnitude smaller than the previous class.

2:57:14.700 --> 2:57:23.060
 And I think about classes is really like airline class.

2:57:23.060 --> 2:57:25.700
 I like class.

2:57:25.700 --> 2:57:28.580
 A lot of people are economy class, business class,

2:57:28.580 --> 2:57:30.900
 and very few are first class and some are budget.

2:57:30.900 --> 2:57:32.860
 I mean, some, I understand.

2:57:32.860 --> 2:57:36.940
 I think there's, yeah, maybe some people,

2:57:36.940 --> 2:57:38.140
 probably I would push back

2:57:38.140 --> 2:57:39.660
 against that definition of the middle class.

2:57:39.660 --> 2:57:41.460
 It does feel like the middle class is pretty large,

2:57:41.460 --> 2:57:44.460
 but yes, there's a discrepancy in terms of wealth.

2:57:45.740 --> 2:57:48.620
 So if you think about in terms of the productivity

2:57:48.620 --> 2:57:50.900
 that our society could have,

2:57:50.900 --> 2:57:53.980
 there is no reason for anybody to fly economy, right?

2:57:53.980 --> 2:57:57.940
 We would be able to let everybody travel in style.

2:57:57.940 --> 2:58:00.220
 Well, but also some people like to be frugal

2:58:00.220 --> 2:58:01.620
 even when they're billionaires, okay?

2:58:01.620 --> 2:58:04.580
 So like that, let's take that into account.

2:58:04.580 --> 2:58:07.260
 I mean, we probably don't need to be a traveling lavish,

2:58:07.260 --> 2:58:09.780
 but you also don't need to be tortured, right?

2:58:09.780 --> 2:58:11.820
 There is a difference between frugal

2:58:11.820 --> 2:58:14.140
 and subjecting yourself to torture.

2:58:14.140 --> 2:58:15.220
 Listen, I love economy.

2:58:15.220 --> 2:58:16.780
 I don't understand why you're comparing

2:58:16.780 --> 2:58:19.420
 a fly economy to torture.

2:58:19.420 --> 2:58:22.500
 I don't, although the fight here,

2:58:22.500 --> 2:58:24.380
 there's two crying babies next to me.

2:58:24.380 --> 2:58:26.460
 So that, but that has nothing to do with economy.

2:58:26.460 --> 2:58:28.540
 It has to do with crying babies.

2:58:28.540 --> 2:58:29.380
 They're very cute though.

2:58:29.380 --> 2:58:30.220
 So they kind of.

2:58:30.220 --> 2:58:31.260
 Yeah, I have two kids

2:58:31.260 --> 2:58:35.020
 and sometimes I have to go back to visit the grandparents.

2:58:35.020 --> 2:58:40.020
 And that means going from the west coast to Germany

2:58:41.300 --> 2:58:42.700
 and that's a long flight.

2:58:42.700 --> 2:58:45.300
 Is it true that, so when you're a father,

2:58:45.300 --> 2:58:48.540
 you grow immune to the crying and all that kind of stuff,

2:58:48.540 --> 2:58:52.260
 like the, because like me just not having kids,

2:58:52.260 --> 2:58:54.620
 it can be other people's kids can be quite annoying

2:58:54.620 --> 2:58:55.820
 when they're crying and screaming

2:58:55.820 --> 2:58:57.220
 and all that kind of stuff.

2:58:57.220 --> 2:58:59.540
 When you have children and you are wired up

2:58:59.540 --> 2:59:01.460
 in the default natural way,

2:59:01.460 --> 2:59:04.340
 you're lucky in this regard, you fall in love with them.

2:59:04.340 --> 2:59:06.980
 And this falling in love with them means

2:59:06.980 --> 2:59:10.180
 that you basically start to see the world through their eyes

2:59:10.180 --> 2:59:12.500
 and you understand that in a given situation,

2:59:12.500 --> 2:59:17.500
 they cannot do anything but being expressing despair.

2:59:17.740 --> 2:59:19.700
 And so it becomes more differentiated.

2:59:19.700 --> 2:59:21.020
 I noticed that for instance,

2:59:21.020 --> 2:59:25.940
 my son is typically acting on a pure experience

2:59:25.940 --> 2:59:28.540
 of what things are like right now

2:59:28.540 --> 2:59:30.380
 and he has to do this right now.

2:59:30.380 --> 2:59:32.540
 And you have this small child that is,

2:59:33.740 --> 2:59:35.020
 when he was a baby and so on,

2:59:35.020 --> 2:59:37.580
 where he was just immediately expressing what he felt.

2:59:37.580 --> 2:59:39.940
 And if you cannot regulate this from the outside,

2:59:39.940 --> 2:59:42.260
 there's no point to be upset about it, right?

2:59:42.260 --> 2:59:45.060
 It's like dealing with weather or something like this.

2:59:45.060 --> 2:59:46.620
 You all have to get through it

2:59:46.620 --> 2:59:48.620
 and it's not easy for him either.

2:59:48.620 --> 2:59:51.820
 But if you also have a daughter,

2:59:51.820 --> 2:59:53.300
 maybe she is planning for that.

2:59:53.300 --> 2:59:57.420
 Maybe she understands that she's sitting in the car

2:59:57.420 --> 2:59:59.860
 behind you and she's screaming at the top of her lungs

2:59:59.860 --> 3:00:01.820
 and you're almost doing an accident

3:00:01.820 --> 3:00:03.740
 and you really don't know what to do.

3:00:03.740 --> 3:00:06.380
 What should I have done to make you stop screaming?

3:00:06.380 --> 3:00:07.900
 You could have given me candy.

3:00:10.020 --> 3:00:12.140
 I think that's like a cat versus dog discussion.

3:00:12.140 --> 3:00:12.980
 I love it.

3:00:13.940 --> 3:00:18.940
 Cause you said like a fundamental aspect of that is love

3:00:19.420 --> 3:00:21.220
 that makes it all worth it.

3:00:21.220 --> 3:00:26.220
 What, in this monkey riding an elephant in a dream world,

3:00:26.740 --> 3:00:30.260
 what role does love play in the human condition?

3:00:31.540 --> 3:00:33.540
 I think that love is the facilitator

3:00:33.540 --> 3:00:35.500
 of non transactional interaction.

3:00:37.140 --> 3:00:40.140
 And you are observing your own purposes.

3:00:40.140 --> 3:00:42.460
 Some of these purposes go beyond your ego.

3:00:42.460 --> 3:00:45.140
 They go beyond the particular organism

3:00:45.140 --> 3:00:46.780
 that you are and your local interests.

3:00:46.780 --> 3:00:48.540
 That's what you mean by non transactional.

3:00:48.540 --> 3:00:50.180
 Yes, so basically when you are acting

3:00:50.180 --> 3:00:52.860
 in a transactional way, it means that you are respecting

3:00:52.860 --> 3:00:54.180
 something in return for you

3:00:55.420 --> 3:00:58.060
 from the one that you're interacting with.

3:00:58.060 --> 3:00:59.860
 You are interacting with a random stranger,

3:00:59.860 --> 3:01:01.340
 you buy something from them on eBay,

3:01:01.340 --> 3:01:03.900
 you expect a fair value for the money that you sent them

3:01:03.900 --> 3:01:05.420
 and vice versa.

3:01:05.420 --> 3:01:06.580
 Because you don't know that person,

3:01:06.580 --> 3:01:09.020
 you don't have any kind of relationship to them.

3:01:09.020 --> 3:01:10.660
 But when you know this person a little bit better

3:01:10.660 --> 3:01:12.740
 and you know the situation that they're in,

3:01:12.740 --> 3:01:14.940
 you understand what they try to achieve in their life

3:01:14.940 --> 3:01:17.700
 and you approve because you realize that they're

3:01:17.700 --> 3:01:22.420
 in some sense serving the same human sacredness as you are.

3:01:22.420 --> 3:01:23.820
 And they need to think that you have,

3:01:23.820 --> 3:01:25.660
 maybe you give it to them as a present.

3:01:26.700 --> 3:01:31.700
 But, I mean, the feeling itself of joy is a kind of benefit,

3:01:32.180 --> 3:01:34.660
 is a kind of transaction, like...

3:01:34.660 --> 3:01:36.500
 Yes, but the joy is not the point.

3:01:36.500 --> 3:01:38.460
 The joy is the signal that you get.

3:01:38.460 --> 3:01:40.900
 It's the reinforcement signal that your brain sends to you

3:01:40.900 --> 3:01:43.740
 because you are acting on the incentives

3:01:43.740 --> 3:01:45.740
 of the agent that you're a part of.

3:01:45.740 --> 3:01:48.500
 We are meant to be part of something larger.

3:01:48.500 --> 3:01:51.340
 This is the way in which we out competed other hominins.

3:01:54.100 --> 3:01:56.420
 Take that Neanderthals.

3:01:56.420 --> 3:01:57.420
 Yeah, right.

3:01:57.420 --> 3:01:59.620
 And also other humans.

3:01:59.620 --> 3:02:03.100
 There was a population bottleneck for human society

3:02:03.100 --> 3:02:06.900
 that leads to an extreme lack of genetic diversity

3:02:06.900 --> 3:02:07.740
 among humans.

3:02:07.740 --> 3:02:11.300
 If you look at Bushmen in the Kalahari,

3:02:11.300 --> 3:02:13.900
 that basically tribes that are not that far distant

3:02:13.900 --> 3:02:15.860
 to each other have more genetic diversity

3:02:15.860 --> 3:02:18.860
 than exists between Europeans and Chinese.

3:02:19.740 --> 3:02:23.460
 And that's because basically the out of Africa population

3:02:23.460 --> 3:02:25.060
 at some point had a bottleneck

3:02:25.060 --> 3:02:27.740
 of just a few thousand individuals.

3:02:27.740 --> 3:02:30.980
 And what probably happened is not that at any time

3:02:30.980 --> 3:02:34.740
 the number of people shrank below a few hundred thousand.

3:02:34.740 --> 3:02:37.580
 What probably happened is that there was a small group

3:02:37.580 --> 3:02:40.460
 that had a decisive mutation that produced an advantage.

3:02:40.460 --> 3:02:44.100
 And this group multiplied and killed everybody else.

3:02:44.100 --> 3:02:46.140
 And we are descendants of that group.

3:02:46.140 --> 3:02:50.780
 Yeah, I wonder what the peculiar characteristics

3:02:50.780 --> 3:02:52.140
 of that group.

3:02:52.140 --> 3:02:53.100
 Yeah.

3:02:53.100 --> 3:02:53.940
 I mean, we can never know.

3:02:53.940 --> 3:02:55.460
 Me too, and a lot of people do.

3:02:55.460 --> 3:02:58.220
 We can only just listen to the echoes in ours,

3:02:58.220 --> 3:03:01.660
 like the ripples that are still within us.

3:03:01.660 --> 3:03:04.420
 So I suspect what eventually made a big difference

3:03:04.420 --> 3:03:07.580
 was the ability to organize at scale,

3:03:07.580 --> 3:03:09.260
 to program each other.

3:03:09.260 --> 3:03:11.380
 With ideas.

3:03:11.380 --> 3:03:12.620
 That we became programmable,

3:03:12.620 --> 3:03:14.500
 that we were willing to work in lockstep,

3:03:14.500 --> 3:03:17.420
 that we went above the tribal level,

3:03:17.420 --> 3:03:20.700
 that we no longer were groups of a few hundred individuals

3:03:20.700 --> 3:03:24.460
 and acted on direct reputation systems transactionally,

3:03:24.460 --> 3:03:27.420
 but that we basically evolved an adaptation

3:03:27.420 --> 3:03:28.980
 to become state building.

3:03:28.980 --> 3:03:29.820
 Yeah.

3:03:31.740 --> 3:03:35.700
 To form collectives outside of the direct collectives.

3:03:35.700 --> 3:03:38.580
 Yes, and that's basically a part of us became committed

3:03:38.580 --> 3:03:41.940
 to serving something outside of what we know.

3:03:41.940 --> 3:03:44.140
 Yeah, then that's kind of what love is.

3:03:44.140 --> 3:03:45.820
 And it's terrifying because it meant

3:03:45.820 --> 3:03:47.420
 that we eradicated the others.

3:03:48.900 --> 3:03:49.820
 Right, it's a force.

3:03:49.820 --> 3:03:52.940
 It's an adaptive force that gets us ahead in evolution,

3:03:52.940 --> 3:03:54.540
 which means we displace something else

3:03:54.540 --> 3:03:55.700
 that doesn't have that.

3:03:56.780 --> 3:03:58.740
 Oh, so we had to murder a lot of people

3:03:58.740 --> 3:04:00.380
 that weren't about love.

3:04:00.380 --> 3:04:01.660
 So love led to destruction.

3:04:01.660 --> 3:04:04.020
 They didn't have the same strong love as we did.

3:04:04.020 --> 3:04:07.420
 Right, that's why I mentioned this thing with fascism.

3:04:07.420 --> 3:04:12.220
 When you see these speeches, do you want total war?

3:04:12.220 --> 3:04:14.180
 And everybody says, yes, right?

3:04:14.180 --> 3:04:17.620
 This is this big, oh my God, we are part of something

3:04:17.620 --> 3:04:18.660
 that is more important than me

3:04:18.660 --> 3:04:20.380
 that gives meaning to my existence.

3:04:22.980 --> 3:04:23.820
 Fair enough.

3:04:27.020 --> 3:04:30.980
 Do you have advice for young people today

3:04:30.980 --> 3:04:33.140
 in high school, in college,

3:04:33.140 --> 3:04:37.260
 that are thinking about what to do with their career,

3:04:37.260 --> 3:04:40.420
 with their life, so that at the end of the whole thing,

3:04:40.420 --> 3:04:42.180
 they can be proud of what they did?

3:04:43.820 --> 3:04:44.660
 Don't cheat.

3:04:45.860 --> 3:04:48.540
 Have integrity, aim for integrity.

3:04:48.540 --> 3:04:50.860
 So what does integrity look like when you're at the river

3:04:50.860 --> 3:04:53.460
 or the leaf or the fat frog in a lake?

3:04:54.580 --> 3:04:57.700
 It basically means that you try to figure out

3:04:57.700 --> 3:05:02.060
 what the thing is that is the most right.

3:05:02.060 --> 3:05:04.620
 And this doesn't mean that you have to look

3:05:04.620 --> 3:05:07.140
 for what other people tell you what's right,

3:05:07.140 --> 3:05:09.740
 but you have to aim for moral autonomy.

3:05:09.740 --> 3:05:12.220
 So things need to be right independently

3:05:12.220 --> 3:05:14.100
 of what other people say.

3:05:14.100 --> 3:05:17.620
 I always felt that when people told me

3:05:17.620 --> 3:05:22.620
 to listen to what others say, like read the room,

3:05:22.940 --> 3:05:25.060
 build your ideas of what's true

3:05:25.060 --> 3:05:27.020
 based on the high status people of your in group,

3:05:27.020 --> 3:05:29.780
 that does not protect me from fascism.

3:05:29.780 --> 3:05:31.940
 The only way to protect yourself from fascism

3:05:31.940 --> 3:05:35.580
 is to decide it's the world that is being built here,

3:05:35.580 --> 3:05:37.620
 the world that I want to be in.

3:05:37.620 --> 3:05:41.740
 And so in some sense, try to make your behavior sustainable,

3:05:41.740 --> 3:05:44.540
 act in such a way that you would feel comfortable

3:05:44.540 --> 3:05:46.420
 on all sides of the transaction.

3:05:46.420 --> 3:05:48.900
 Realize that everybody is you in a different timeline,

3:05:48.900 --> 3:05:51.140
 but is seeing things differently

3:05:51.140 --> 3:05:52.620
 and has reasons to do so.

3:05:53.940 --> 3:05:58.100
 Yeah, I've come to realize this recently,

3:05:58.100 --> 3:05:59.340
 that there is an inner voice

3:05:59.340 --> 3:06:02.820
 that tells you what's right and wrong.

3:06:02.820 --> 3:06:06.180
 And speaking of reading the room,

3:06:06.180 --> 3:06:08.060
 there's times what integrity looks like

3:06:08.060 --> 3:06:10.460
 is there's times when a lot of people

3:06:10.460 --> 3:06:12.180
 are doing something wrong.

3:06:12.180 --> 3:06:13.740
 And what integrity looks like

3:06:13.740 --> 3:06:16.500
 is not going on Twitter and tweeting about it,

3:06:16.500 --> 3:06:20.260
 but not participating quietly, not doing.

3:06:20.260 --> 3:06:24.100
 So it's not like signaling or not all this kind of stuff,

3:06:24.100 --> 3:06:28.020
 but actually living your, what you think is right.

3:06:28.020 --> 3:06:28.860
 Like living it, not signaling.

3:06:28.860 --> 3:06:30.980
 There's also sometimes this expectation

3:06:30.980 --> 3:06:32.260
 that others are like us.

3:06:32.260 --> 3:06:34.380
 So imagine the possibility

3:06:34.380 --> 3:06:37.060
 that some of the people around you are space aliens

3:06:37.060 --> 3:06:39.500
 that only look human, right?

3:06:39.500 --> 3:06:41.620
 So they don't have the same prayers as you do.

3:06:41.620 --> 3:06:44.100
 They don't have the same impulses

3:06:44.100 --> 3:06:45.180
 that's what's right and wrong.

3:06:45.180 --> 3:06:48.900
 There's a large diversity in these basic impulses

3:06:48.900 --> 3:06:51.820
 that people can have in a given situation.

3:06:51.820 --> 3:06:54.660
 And now realize that you are a space alien, right?

3:06:54.660 --> 3:06:55.900
 You are not actually human.

3:06:55.900 --> 3:06:57.220
 You think that you are human,

3:06:57.220 --> 3:06:58.820
 but you don't know what it means,

3:06:58.820 --> 3:07:00.780
 like what it's like to be human.

3:07:00.780 --> 3:07:04.020
 You just make it up as you go along like everybody else.

3:07:04.020 --> 3:07:05.740
 And you have to figure that out,

3:07:05.740 --> 3:07:09.620
 what it means that you are a full human being,

3:07:09.620 --> 3:07:11.180
 what it means to be human in the world

3:07:11.180 --> 3:07:13.540
 and how to connect with others on that.

3:07:13.540 --> 3:07:17.340
 And there is also something, don't be afraid

3:07:17.340 --> 3:07:20.980
 in the sense that if you do this, you're not good enough.

3:07:20.980 --> 3:07:23.580
 Because if you are acting on these incentives of integrity,

3:07:23.580 --> 3:07:25.140
 you become trustworthy.

3:07:25.140 --> 3:07:28.420
 That's the way in which you can recognize each other.

3:07:28.420 --> 3:07:30.700
 There is a particular place where you can meet.

3:07:30.700 --> 3:07:33.060
 You can figure out what that place is,

3:07:33.060 --> 3:07:35.420
 where you will give support to people

3:07:35.420 --> 3:07:38.420
 because you realize that they act with integrity

3:07:38.420 --> 3:07:40.300
 and they will also do that.

3:07:40.300 --> 3:07:42.580
 So in some sense, you are safe if you do that.

3:07:43.860 --> 3:07:44.940
 You're not always protected.

3:07:44.940 --> 3:07:47.100
 There are people which will abuse you

3:07:47.100 --> 3:07:49.940
 and that are bad actors in a way

3:07:49.940 --> 3:07:52.780
 that it's hard to imagine before you meet them.

3:07:52.780 --> 3:07:57.780
 But there is also people which will try to protect you.

3:07:57.780 --> 3:08:00.820
 Yeah, that's such a, thank you for saying that.

3:08:00.820 --> 3:08:03.820
 That's such a hopeful message

3:08:03.820 --> 3:08:05.380
 that no matter what happens to you,

3:08:05.380 --> 3:08:10.100
 there'll be a place, there's people you'll meet

3:08:11.740 --> 3:08:15.620
 that also have what you have

3:08:15.620 --> 3:08:20.180
 and you will find happiness there and safety there.

3:08:20.180 --> 3:08:21.700
 Yeah, but it doesn't need to end well.

3:08:21.700 --> 3:08:23.500
 It can also all go wrong.

3:08:23.500 --> 3:08:26.380
 So there's no guarantees in this life.

3:08:26.380 --> 3:08:29.380
 So you can do everything right and you still can fail

3:08:29.380 --> 3:08:32.500
 and you can see horrible things happening to you

3:08:32.500 --> 3:08:35.060
 that traumatize you and mutilate you

3:08:35.060 --> 3:08:37.580
 and you have to be grateful if it doesn't happen.

3:08:40.300 --> 3:08:42.940
 And ultimately be grateful no matter what happens

3:08:42.940 --> 3:08:45.620
 because even just being alive is pretty damn nice.

3:08:46.860 --> 3:08:48.220
 Yeah, even that, you know.

3:08:49.580 --> 3:08:52.260
 The gratefulness in some sense is also just generated

3:08:52.260 --> 3:08:57.260
 by your brain to keep you going, it's all the trick.

3:08:58.900 --> 3:09:01.980
 Speaking of which, Camus said,

3:09:02.900 --> 3:09:05.540
 I see many people die because they judge

3:09:05.540 --> 3:09:08.020
 that life is not worth living.

3:09:08.020 --> 3:09:10.820
 I see others paradoxically getting killed

3:09:10.820 --> 3:09:12.860
 for the ideas or illusions that give them

3:09:12.860 --> 3:09:15.020
 a reason for living.

3:09:15.020 --> 3:09:16.420
 What is called the reason for living

3:09:16.420 --> 3:09:18.460
 is also an excellent reason for dying.

3:09:19.420 --> 3:09:22.020
 I therefore conclude that the meaning of life

3:09:22.020 --> 3:09:24.660
 is the most urgent of questions.

3:09:24.660 --> 3:09:29.660
 So I have to ask what Jascha Bach is the meaning of life?

3:09:31.500 --> 3:09:33.860
 It is an urgent question according to Camus.

3:09:35.260 --> 3:09:37.940
 I don't think that there's a single answer to this.

3:09:37.940 --> 3:09:41.340
 Nothing makes sense unless the mind makes it so.

3:09:41.340 --> 3:09:44.820
 So you basically have to project a purpose.

3:09:44.820 --> 3:09:47.380
 And if you zoom out far enough,

3:09:47.380 --> 3:09:49.060
 there's the heat test of the universe

3:09:49.060 --> 3:09:50.500
 and everything is meaningless,

3:09:50.500 --> 3:09:52.100
 everything is just a blip in between.

3:09:52.100 --> 3:09:54.020
 And the question is, do you find meaning

3:09:54.020 --> 3:09:55.820
 in this blip in between?

3:09:55.820 --> 3:09:59.780
 Do you find meaning in observing squirrels?

3:09:59.780 --> 3:10:01.740
 Do you find meaning in raising children

3:10:01.740 --> 3:10:04.420
 and projecting a multi generational organism

3:10:04.420 --> 3:10:05.660
 into the future?

3:10:05.660 --> 3:10:08.260
 Do you find meaning in projecting an aesthetic

3:10:08.260 --> 3:10:10.620
 of the world that you like to the future

3:10:10.620 --> 3:10:12.340
 and trying to serve that aesthetic?

3:10:12.340 --> 3:10:15.300
 And if you do, then life has that meaning.

3:10:15.300 --> 3:10:17.140
 And if you don't, then it doesn't.

3:10:17.140 --> 3:10:21.780
 I kind of enjoy the idea that you just create

3:10:21.780 --> 3:10:25.660
 the most vibrant, the most weird,

3:10:25.660 --> 3:10:28.740
 the most unique kind of blip you can,

3:10:28.740 --> 3:10:32.020
 given your environment, given your set of skills,

3:10:32.020 --> 3:10:37.020
 just be the most weird set of,

3:10:38.740 --> 3:10:41.740
 like local pocket of complexity you can be.

3:10:41.740 --> 3:10:44.500
 So that like, when people study the universe,

3:10:44.500 --> 3:10:47.340
 they'll pause and be like, oh, that's weird.

3:10:47.340 --> 3:10:50.580
 It looks like a useful strategy,

3:10:50.580 --> 3:10:52.780
 but of course it's still motivated reasoning.

3:10:52.780 --> 3:10:57.780
 You're obviously acting on your incentives here.

3:10:57.780 --> 3:11:00.700
 It's still a story we tell ourselves within a dream

3:11:00.700 --> 3:11:03.860
 that's hardly in touch with the reality.

3:11:03.860 --> 3:11:06.460
 It's definitely a good strategy if you are a podcaster.

3:11:10.180 --> 3:11:13.060
 And a human, which I'm still trying to figure out if I am.

3:11:13.060 --> 3:11:15.020
 It has a mutual relationship somehow.

3:11:15.020 --> 3:11:16.060
 Somehow.

3:11:16.060 --> 3:11:20.860
 Josh, you're one of the most incredible people I know.

3:11:20.860 --> 3:11:22.380
 I really love talking to you.

3:11:22.380 --> 3:11:23.500
 I love talking to you again,

3:11:23.500 --> 3:11:26.060
 and it's really an honor that you spend

3:11:26.060 --> 3:11:27.100
 your valuable time with me.

3:11:27.100 --> 3:11:28.580
 I hope we get to talk many times

3:11:28.580 --> 3:11:33.580
 through our short and meaningless lives.

3:11:33.580 --> 3:11:34.620
 Or meaningful.

3:11:34.620 --> 3:11:35.900
 Or meaningful.

3:11:35.900 --> 3:11:36.740
 Thank you, Alex.

3:11:36.740 --> 3:11:39.020
 I enjoyed this conversation very much.

3:11:39.020 --> 3:11:41.700
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Josche Bach.

3:11:41.700 --> 3:11:45.900
 A thank you to Coinbase, Codecademy, Linode,

3:11:45.900 --> 3:11:48.500
 NetSuite, and ExpressVPN.

3:11:48.500 --> 3:11:52.020
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

3:11:52.020 --> 3:11:54.900
 Now, let me leave you with some words from Carl Jung.

3:11:55.780 --> 3:11:59.020
 People will do anything, no matter how absurd,

3:11:59.020 --> 3:12:01.780
 in order to avoid facing their own souls.

3:12:01.780 --> 3:12:03.580
 One does not become enlightened

3:12:03.580 --> 3:12:05.780
 by imagining figures of light,

3:12:05.780 --> 3:12:09.260
 but by making the darkness conscious.

3:12:09.260 --> 3:12:12.500
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
