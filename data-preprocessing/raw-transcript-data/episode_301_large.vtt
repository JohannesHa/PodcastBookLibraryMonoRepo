00:00.000 --> 00:07.320
 Something happened where they forced my hand, and this is the only time that a Soviet agent

00:07.320 --> 00:12.120
 was anywhere near me on the territory of the United States.

00:12.120 --> 00:20.680
 So I'm waiting for the A train on a dark morning still in Queens, and there's this man in a

00:20.680 --> 00:27.600
 black trench coat comes up to me from my right, and he whispers into my ears, you gotta come

00:27.600 --> 00:32.320
 back or else you're dead.

00:32.320 --> 00:38.480
 The following is a conversation with Jack Barsky, a former KGB spy, author of Deep Undercover

00:38.480 --> 00:43.520
 and the subject of an excellent podcast series called The Agent.

00:43.520 --> 00:49.160
 There are very few people who have defected from the KGB and live to tell the story.

00:49.160 --> 00:53.280
 It is one of the most powerful intelligence organizations in history.

00:53.280 --> 00:59.120
 And this conversation gives a window into its operation, both from an ideological and

00:59.120 --> 01:06.200
 psychological perspective, but also it tells the story of a man who lived one heck of an

01:06.200 --> 01:08.340
 incredible life.

01:08.340 --> 01:13.880
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast, to support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:13.880 --> 01:18.280
 And now, dear friends, here's Jack Barsky.

01:18.280 --> 01:20.560
 Let's start with a big basic question.

01:20.560 --> 01:21.560
 What is the KGB?

01:21.560 --> 01:24.560
 Комитет Государственной Безопасности.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.120
 Right.

01:26.120 --> 01:29.000
 So that is the Committee of State Security.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
 Yeah.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
 There's an opossumist.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.040
 Opossumist is a threat, right?

01:33.040 --> 01:34.040
 Threat.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.040
 Okay.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.040
 And BS means...

01:36.040 --> 01:37.040
 Without.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.040
 Right.

01:38.040 --> 01:39.800
 And I guess that directly translates to security.

01:39.800 --> 01:40.800
 Without threat.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.640
 So, and don't exist anymore.

01:43.640 --> 01:49.840
 It was disbanded when the Soviet Union fell apart and the successor agencies are now the

01:49.840 --> 01:57.300
 SVR and the FSB, FSB supposedly the equivalent to the FBI and SVR, the CIA.

01:57.300 --> 02:06.260
 But the SVR is relatively weak and the FSB has taken on a lot of espionage and active

02:06.260 --> 02:09.420
 measures and they're much bigger and stronger.

02:09.420 --> 02:16.720
 But the most capable intelligence agency in Russia is the GRU, Military Intelligence.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.560
 That nobody knows very much about.

02:18.560 --> 02:19.560
 That's right.

02:19.560 --> 02:23.400
 When I was in the KGB, I had no idea that there was military intelligence.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.560
 Nobody ever mentioned anything like that.

02:25.560 --> 02:31.720
 And by the way, I recently had the pleasure to give a talk at the DIA.

02:31.720 --> 02:35.080
 When they reached out to me, I didn't know they existed either.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.080
 Interesting.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.080
 Yeah.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.080
 That's always the question.

02:38.080 --> 02:42.760
 If you want to be an intelligence agency, should the world know anything about you?

02:42.760 --> 02:48.760
 Because in some sense, you want to create the legend in order to attract great competent

02:48.760 --> 02:54.480
 individuals to work for you, but at the same time, you want it to be shrouded in complete

02:54.480 --> 02:55.480
 mystery.

02:55.480 --> 03:01.840
 If nobody knows you exist, you might be able to operate well as an intelligence agency.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.200
 That is fascinating.

03:03.200 --> 03:12.600
 But FSB is the thing that carries the flag of KGB, KGB being probably one of, if not

03:12.600 --> 03:19.720
 the most sort of infamous, famous, infamous, and powerful intelligence agencies in history

03:19.720 --> 03:20.720
 ever.

03:20.720 --> 03:21.720
 Absolutely.

03:21.720 --> 03:22.720
 100%.

03:22.720 --> 03:26.960
 It was founded in 1954 after the death of Stalin.

03:26.960 --> 03:31.200
 In writing your book, you've looked back at the predecessors of the history.

03:31.200 --> 03:42.560
 Is there some way in which the KGB is grounded in the culture, the spirit, the soul of the

03:42.560 --> 03:43.560
 KGB?

03:43.560 --> 03:44.560
 Its predecessors.

03:44.560 --> 03:45.560
 Oh, absolutely.

03:45.560 --> 03:51.320
 They just changed names and they changed personnel rather frequently, and that had something

03:51.320 --> 03:54.120
 to do with Stalin's paranoia.

03:54.120 --> 04:00.560
 From between 1923, and I don't remember what, I think it may have been the NKVD at that

04:00.560 --> 04:01.560
 time.

04:01.560 --> 04:11.920
 It started as the Chika, and then it became the GPU, the NKVD, but with those name changes,

04:11.920 --> 04:14.240
 you also had changes at the top.

04:14.240 --> 04:24.040
 Between 1923 and 1953, when Stalin died, that is 30 years, they had eight heads of intelligence,

04:24.040 --> 04:29.280
 and of those eight, six were executed when they were replaced.

04:29.280 --> 04:38.360
 So that's an indication that this was an organization that ate itself from the inside.

04:38.360 --> 04:42.600
 The Soviet Union was the only dictatorship in history that did not rest its powers on

04:42.600 --> 04:43.920
 the military.

04:43.920 --> 04:49.900
 They rested its powers on the intelligence apparatus, and that thing was unstable.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.320
 So you know where that leads.

04:52.320 --> 04:58.120
 Eventually, if you rest your power on something that is made out of bricks that don't hold

04:58.120 --> 05:01.280
 a lot of load, it will fall apart.

05:01.280 --> 05:02.280
 On sand.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.280
 Yeah.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.560
 Why was it unstable, would you say?

05:04.560 --> 05:07.520
 What of human nature makes it unstable?

05:07.520 --> 05:09.360
 It's the paranoia.

05:09.360 --> 05:17.320
 Stalin was always worried about the most powerful people coming after him.

05:17.320 --> 05:23.080
 So he proactively killed off heads of the KGB, and he had this great purge where he

05:23.080 --> 05:31.760
 got rid of a lot of his generals, really capable generals, and that cost him dearly when World

05:31.760 --> 05:39.640
 War II started, because he started off with a force that wasn't as capable as it could

05:39.640 --> 05:41.000
 have been.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.840
 Was it paranoia at all levels?

05:42.840 --> 05:43.840
 I believe so.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.200
 I believe so.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.680
 It comes from the top.

05:46.680 --> 05:55.600
 And so if the top doesn't trust you, you always have to worry about your peers snitching on

05:55.600 --> 05:58.260
 you.

05:58.260 --> 06:07.840
 And I think we have a very similar situation in Russia today, and in this kind of atmosphere,

06:07.840 --> 06:10.320
 the truth will never get to the top.

06:10.320 --> 06:17.240
 So no matter what moral rules the organization operates under, trust is fundamental to its

06:17.240 --> 06:18.240
 competence.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.240
 Oh, absolutely.

06:19.240 --> 06:26.600
 And I want to extend this to my own existence, and this is kind of strange.

06:26.600 --> 06:34.700
 It's almost dichotomous, because I was running around lying to everybody, and I couldn't

06:34.700 --> 06:35.960
 fundamentally be trusted.

06:35.960 --> 06:40.000
 But the relationship that I had with the KGB was based on trust.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.120
 If they don't trust me, they don't send me out.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.960
 And if I don't trust them, I'm not going.

06:45.960 --> 06:50.960
 And I eventually broke that trust, and they knew there was always that danger.

06:50.960 --> 06:56.240
 They knew that because something about you or just something about human beings that

06:56.240 --> 06:57.760
 can be broken.

06:57.760 --> 07:05.080
 There were hints about how long my assignment would be, so 10 to 12 years.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.840
 And you see, it makes sense.

07:07.840 --> 07:13.840
 I was becoming an American, and over time, I would become more and more American, and

07:13.840 --> 07:19.920
 there was always a chance that I liked it more here than there, that I was really successful

07:19.920 --> 07:22.680
 in what I was supposed to do.

07:22.680 --> 07:28.680
 And it sort of happened, but in my case, it happened because I fathered a child who I

07:28.680 --> 07:30.880
 didn't want to leave when they wanted me back.

07:30.880 --> 07:36.520
 Love always screws up your employment competence, yes.

07:36.520 --> 07:40.040
 You're absolutely right.

07:40.040 --> 07:48.760
 But they thought that I had an anchor at home because I had a wife and a son at home, which

07:48.760 --> 07:53.800
 you've got to worry about them if you defect.

07:53.800 --> 08:01.440
 Because in the past, the KGB would go after family ruthlessly.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.000
 Including perhaps violence?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
 Yeah.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.320
 This is a hard question about the KGB because it's one of the most ruthless organizations,

08:08.320 --> 08:18.680
 but in general, are there lines, KGB agents at every level of the hierarchy that they

08:18.680 --> 08:25.280
 would not cross, political, legal, ethical, or does anything goes to achieve the goal?

08:25.280 --> 08:35.480
 I was only in touch with two types of agents, the technical experts, the ones that taught

08:35.480 --> 08:42.680
 me tradecraft, and they were like engineers and they were in charge of the secret writing

08:42.680 --> 08:53.000
 and the Morse code, shortwave radio reception, decryption, encryption, and that kind of stuff.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.240
 Those were just doing their job.

08:56.240 --> 09:03.360
 And the others, the ones that trained me, that prepared me for life in the United States,

09:03.360 --> 09:05.320
 they were nice people.

09:05.320 --> 09:08.320
 They were elegant people.

09:08.320 --> 09:19.040
 I don't think they would not fit into the stereotype of the ruthless gun carrying agent.

09:19.040 --> 09:25.080
 Is it possible that you would not be aware of the parts of the KGB, I mean, it's very

09:25.080 --> 09:26.080
 modular.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.080
 Would you?

09:27.080 --> 09:28.080
 Yeah.

09:28.080 --> 09:30.880
 It's possible that you're not aware of the parts of the KGB that are the quote unquote

09:30.880 --> 09:31.880
 muscle.

09:31.880 --> 09:32.960
 Oh, I didn't know.

09:32.960 --> 09:39.920
 I would find out afterwards, after I retired and started doing some research, I had no

09:39.920 --> 09:40.920
 clue.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.240
 So you're kind of operating in a bubble.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.480
 Oh, very much so.

09:43.480 --> 09:51.840
 I mean, this is what the KGB did really, really well, compartmentalization, and that was based

09:51.840 --> 09:57.240
 on the communist movement while it was still underground.

09:57.240 --> 10:02.840
 The cells were very small, so that maybe there were three, four members in one cell that

10:02.840 --> 10:07.760
 knew one another, and then they had a liaison to another cell.

10:07.760 --> 10:13.600
 The bottom line is if you got one of those folks were caught, they could maybe betray

10:13.600 --> 10:20.880
 four people or three, something like that, and the KGB continued with that tradition.

10:20.880 --> 10:27.560
 I have reason to believe that my handler, the person in Moscow that sort of directed

10:27.560 --> 10:33.040
 me and made decisions what to do and where to go, never met me personally.

10:33.040 --> 10:37.720
 There's no reason to.

10:37.720 --> 10:45.440
 This actually was a big advantage over other intelligence services because you look at

10:45.440 --> 10:46.800
 what the CIA does.

10:46.800 --> 10:47.800
 Everybody blabs.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.880
 There's a lot of leaks coming out of American intelligence.

10:50.880 --> 10:54.480
 I don't think there's as many leaks coming out of the Mossad.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.440
 Strong words from Jack Barsky, by the way.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.920
 That is a question I want to ask a little more systematically.

10:59.920 --> 11:05.280
 Is there something unique about the KGB compared to the other intelligence agencies?

11:05.280 --> 11:11.920
 Let's talk British intelligence, MI6, Mossad, CIA.

11:11.920 --> 11:17.180
 Is there unique cultures, spirits, souls of the different organizations that maybe somehow

11:17.180 --> 11:22.800
 connect to the structures of government, connect maybe the values of the people, those kinds

11:22.800 --> 11:23.800
 of things?

11:23.800 --> 11:31.580
 I believe we were all pretty much strong believers in communism and the future of the world being...

11:31.580 --> 11:32.580
 In KGB?

11:32.580 --> 11:33.580
 Yes.

11:33.580 --> 11:38.960
 I think that unified us to a large degree, even the technicians.

11:38.960 --> 11:46.720
 It wasn't something like, yeah, yeah, the parents believe this thing, but we know the

11:46.720 --> 11:47.720
 truth.

11:47.720 --> 11:49.800
 You really believe the story of communism.

11:49.800 --> 11:50.800
 Absolutely did.

11:50.800 --> 11:54.380
 And you need to look at the timeframe.

11:54.380 --> 12:02.760
 The Soviet Union after World War II made quite a bit of progress in influencing the Third

12:02.760 --> 12:03.760
 World.

12:03.760 --> 12:09.560
 I still remember when I was in middle school, we had a map, the map of the world, and it

12:09.560 --> 12:11.200
 was color coded.

12:11.200 --> 12:16.740
 So red was communism, that was the Soviet Union and the Eastern states, and then blue

12:16.740 --> 12:18.320
 was capitalism.

12:18.320 --> 12:24.400
 And then we had green, which were the Third World countries, and the green slowly turned

12:24.400 --> 12:30.480
 pink because a lot of Third World governments, like I'm looking at Angola, I'm looking at

12:30.480 --> 12:40.160
 Vietnam, a lot of these countries were very sympathetic to the Soviet Union.

12:40.160 --> 12:45.640
 And so we sort of knew that this would go on like that, and eventually we would take

12:45.640 --> 12:55.680
 over and pretty much overtake, that was the myth, overtake the United States, not only

12:55.680 --> 13:02.000
 militarily but also in terms of industrial production and so forth.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.840
 That was a stupid pipe dream.

13:03.840 --> 13:08.600
 The military, it was a standoff, as we know.

13:08.600 --> 13:13.320
 A stupid pipe dream.

13:13.320 --> 13:22.040
 Hitler had a stupid pipe dream that he executed it exceptionally effectively and on, if not

13:22.040 --> 13:28.200
 for a handful of military mistakes, the world could look very different today.

13:28.200 --> 13:34.480
 Well, the biggest one being invading the Soviet Union, particularly at the time that he did

13:34.480 --> 13:40.480
 it because he ran into the same thing that Napoleon ran into General Winter.

13:40.480 --> 13:49.520
 Well within, so Operation Barbarossa, within that he could have made different decisions.

13:49.520 --> 13:56.080
 For example, attacking, skipping Kiev and attacking Moscow directly, overthrowing the

13:56.080 --> 13:57.080
 government.

13:57.080 --> 14:03.880
 So marching, I guess that would be learning lessons from Napoleon as opposed to a different

14:03.880 --> 14:07.600
 kind of distribution of forces and then getting bogged down in the winter.

14:07.600 --> 14:14.720
 But the point is these ambitions sometimes do, the ambitions of empires sometimes do

14:14.720 --> 14:18.680
 materialize in the growth and the building and the establishment of those empires and

14:18.680 --> 14:25.080
 those empires write the history books in such a way that we don't think of them as empires

14:25.080 --> 14:27.880
 or we certainly don't think of them as the bad guys.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.640
 They write the history books, therefore they're the good guys.

14:30.640 --> 14:35.120
 And right now America has effectively written the book about the good guys.

14:35.120 --> 14:41.680
 I happen to believe that book, but it's, we should be humbled and open minded to realize

14:41.680 --> 14:47.120
 that that is in fact what is happening is effective empires write the history books

14:47.120 --> 14:51.960
 and tell us stories and tell us propaganda and tell us narratives that we believe because

14:51.960 --> 14:55.920
 we are human beings and we love to get together and believe ideas.

14:55.920 --> 15:00.480
 We love to dream of a beautiful world and try to build that beautiful world together

15:00.480 --> 15:01.480
 in the United States.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.480
 That's a beautiful world.

15:02.480 --> 15:11.280
 The freedom of respect of human rights of all men are created equal pursuit of happiness.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.180
 You know, it always sounds good.

15:13.180 --> 15:19.680
 If you look at what the dream of communism is, it sure as heck in its words on the surface

15:19.680 --> 15:20.680
 sounds good.

15:20.680 --> 15:21.680
 Yes.

15:21.680 --> 15:22.680
 Respect for the workers.

15:22.680 --> 15:23.680
 Yes.

15:23.680 --> 15:27.860
 The working class, the lower classes that have been trodden on that have been stolen

15:27.860 --> 15:33.360
 from by the powerful, they deserve to have the money, the power, the respect that they

15:33.360 --> 15:35.640
 have earned through their hard work.

15:35.640 --> 15:36.640
 Sounds great.

15:36.640 --> 15:44.700
 And everybody gets along and we just have to, you know, uh, all men are wonderful people.

15:44.700 --> 15:48.360
 And if they, if they go bad, it has something to do with the fact that they have, they have

15:48.360 --> 15:51.000
 been oppressed, right?

15:51.000 --> 15:54.160
 And uh, that dream just never worked out.

15:54.160 --> 15:59.400
 And even, even it is when you think about it and I didn't think about it when you're

15:59.400 --> 16:02.840
 young, you know, you just emotionally, you accept it.

16:02.840 --> 16:09.640
 But when you think about it, somehow, uh, that new wonderful organization has to organize

16:09.640 --> 16:14.400
 itself even though Lenin predicted that the state eventually would go away.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.960
 Well, how does it, how does that work?

16:15.960 --> 16:17.840
 Then you have like anarchy, right?

16:17.840 --> 16:19.860
 You have to have an organization.

16:19.860 --> 16:26.800
 The only way to really organize a large number of people is with a hierarchy.

16:26.800 --> 16:32.800
 So and who gets to the top, the ones that are, that want to go to the top, the ones

16:32.800 --> 16:37.360
 that believe in themselves, the ones, the ones that know better than everybody else.

16:37.360 --> 16:41.880
 And once you have that hierarchy established, uh, there is no guarantee that it doesn't

16:41.880 --> 16:43.640
 that it won't go bad.

16:43.640 --> 16:48.900
 And actually when you look at history, every such hierarchy has gone bad.

16:48.900 --> 16:55.320
 You know, you look at Cuba, for instance, I believe Fidel Castro was a, an honest revolutionary.

16:55.320 --> 16:58.340
 I do believe that.

16:58.340 --> 17:00.960
 And so what did Cuba turn into?

17:00.960 --> 17:01.960
 Yeah.

17:01.960 --> 17:06.000
 There's something about, and you speak about Vladimir Putin in this way, but let's step

17:06.000 --> 17:08.820
 away from that for a second.

17:08.820 --> 17:15.680
 Is there something about being an honest revolutionary that wants to do good for their country and

17:15.680 --> 17:20.980
 you start to believe that, you know, better than everyone else how to do good on the country

17:20.980 --> 17:30.040
 and you very well might first, but then somehow that grows into a distortion field where,

17:30.040 --> 17:33.160
 you know, you keep believing, you know, what's right.

17:33.160 --> 17:38.220
 And all the people who disagree with you, you stop seeing them as having a point.

17:38.220 --> 17:46.400
 You instead see them as like, um, um, evil manipulators of the truth that are actually

17:46.400 --> 17:49.840
 trying to hurt people for their own greed, for their own power.

17:49.840 --> 17:54.200
 And you will protect the people because you know, what's good in the case of Stalin.

17:54.200 --> 18:02.400
 I, I mean, I don't know, but it seems like he really believed that communism would bring

18:02.400 --> 18:04.240
 about a much better world.

18:04.240 --> 18:12.400
 I mean, there was a sense the, you have to crack a few eggs to make an omelet, this idea

18:12.400 --> 18:18.680
 that sacrifice is necessary to bring about a greater world.

18:18.680 --> 18:27.800
 And then the other aspect is sort of ruling by terror, creating terrorism, justified political

18:27.800 --> 18:30.680
 mechanism to achieve a better world.

18:30.680 --> 18:35.320
 But it wasn't, I mean, perhaps he had to do that to be able to sleep at night with the

18:35.320 --> 18:37.120
 atrocities he's committing.

18:37.120 --> 18:41.280
 He's, I think he believed he will bring about a better world.

18:41.280 --> 18:42.280
 Yeah.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.880
 And by the way, the terror didn't start with Stalin.

18:43.880 --> 18:52.960
 It started right after the Bolsheviks took over when Lenin told Mr. Dzerzhinsky, Commodore

18:52.960 --> 19:03.240
 Dzerzhinsky to build the Cheka and then execute the, this is what he called it, the red terror.

19:03.240 --> 19:11.080
 So at the birth of the Soviet Union, there was already terror and it was deliberate.

19:11.080 --> 19:18.680
 And it also was, it wasn't just focused on the enemies, it was focused on whoever you

19:18.680 --> 19:19.680
 didn't like.

19:19.680 --> 19:27.240
 There was no rule of law, there was no court cases, people were just pulled out of their

19:27.240 --> 19:31.620
 apartments and shot on sight.

19:31.620 --> 19:40.480
 And this was done by revolutionaries who were convinced that eventually, these sacrifices

19:40.480 --> 19:44.680
 had to be made and eventually that would lead to a much better planet.

19:44.680 --> 19:48.880
 And the populace believed this too, that those sacrifices in part.

19:48.880 --> 19:59.720
 I mean, this is such a dark thing about dictatorships is you believe it, but you're also too afraid

19:59.720 --> 20:01.560
 to question your beliefs.

20:01.560 --> 20:06.840
 Like, you're not directly afraid, but almost like, I don't know what that is.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.960
 That's almost like a subconscious fear.

20:08.960 --> 20:13.400
 Like don't, there's a dark room with a locked door, don't look in that door.

20:13.400 --> 20:14.400
 Don't check that door.

20:14.400 --> 20:19.880
 And there's something about the United States that says, especially modern culture, it's

20:19.880 --> 20:25.400
 like go to that door first and sort of question everything kind of, that's the power of the

20:25.400 --> 20:31.160
 freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, but you can get almost become too critical

20:31.160 --> 20:33.320
 and too cynical of your own culture in that way.

20:33.320 --> 20:39.080
 So there's a balance to strike, of course, but man, if communism is not a lesson of human

20:39.080 --> 20:44.360
 nature, I don't know what is, but you believed, without thinking too much about it, you believed

20:44.360 --> 20:51.200
 in the story of, what did you see, just, you know, I came from the Soviet Union.

20:51.200 --> 21:01.480
 What did you maybe feel that's right and good about communism, about the vision of communism?

21:01.480 --> 21:02.480
 Do you remember?

21:02.480 --> 21:12.680
 I think the biggest impetus in me believing in communism was that the communists, just

21:12.680 --> 21:20.000
 before Hitler took over, the communists were the only force in Germany that fought the

21:20.000 --> 21:26.320
 Nazis in the streets, and that's a historic truth.

21:26.320 --> 21:34.320
 And communists were hunted down by the Nazis, killed, put in concentration camps.

21:34.320 --> 21:41.320
 And so what we knew, what we were taught, and I think that was a huge unforced error

21:41.320 --> 21:46.360
 by the Western countries, particularly the United States, that there were ex Nazis in

21:46.360 --> 21:49.560
 the government in West Germany.

21:49.560 --> 21:57.980
 And the most famous one was Reinhard Galen, who was in charge, was the general in charge

21:57.980 --> 22:05.440
 of the intelligence on the Eastern Front under Hitler.

22:05.440 --> 22:15.800
 And when the Allied won the war, it was decided that Galen was too important, his knowledge

22:15.800 --> 22:21.080
 and his organization was too important to not use.

22:21.080 --> 22:26.560
 So he was coopted by the CIA and eventually wound up being the head of the Bundesnachrichtendienst,

22:26.560 --> 22:29.480
 the CIA of West Germany.

22:29.480 --> 22:36.520
 That gave us, us, when I say us, the East German party, a huge propaganda victory.

22:36.520 --> 22:42.300
 I wanted to, because the emotional aspect of this was as follows.

22:42.300 --> 22:54.400
 When we were in, juniors in high school, and in those days, you were only allowed to go

22:54.400 --> 22:57.120
 to high school if you were in the top 10% of students, okay?

22:57.120 --> 23:02.640
 So this was going to be the next set of ruling elite in the country.

23:02.640 --> 23:09.000
 We were sent, we were required to visit a concentration camp.

23:09.000 --> 23:18.200
 And if you know what we as 17 year olds were made to look at, it was gut wrenching.

23:18.200 --> 23:28.080
 How can men do something like that to men, piles of corpses, lampshades made out of human

23:28.080 --> 23:38.200
 skin because that skin had tattoos on them, and shrunken heads like the size of my fist.

23:38.200 --> 23:42.640
 I mean, the girls all cried, and it made a huge impression.

23:42.640 --> 23:48.600
 And that was the Nazis, and the Communists defeated the Nazis.

23:48.600 --> 23:49.600
 They were the good guys.

23:49.600 --> 23:53.780
 Of course, in hindsight, if the Communists had come to power, it would have been just

23:53.780 --> 23:59.000
 the other way around, as we know, given the example of Stalin and Mao, right?

23:59.000 --> 24:02.240
 But we didn't know that.

24:02.240 --> 24:10.920
 From the Russian and Soviet perspective, the Communist regime banded together to win the

24:10.920 --> 24:12.920
 Great Patriotic War.

24:12.920 --> 24:18.000
 And that was the second one, the big brother, the Soviet Union.

24:18.000 --> 24:24.500
 I mean, when I was approached by the KGB, that was like, oh, I felt so honored.

24:24.500 --> 24:31.680
 So we should say that we're talking about East Germany, that you're from East Germany.

24:31.680 --> 24:36.760
 Can you describe, you were born four years and what is it?

24:36.760 --> 24:37.760
 Yeah, four years.

24:37.760 --> 24:38.760
 10 days?

24:38.760 --> 24:39.760
 Yeah, sort of.

24:39.760 --> 24:40.760
 Very good.

24:40.760 --> 24:46.000
 After Germany's unconditional surrender in World War II.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.720
 So what is East Germany?

24:47.720 --> 24:48.720
 What is West Germany?

24:48.720 --> 24:51.120
 What is East and West Germany?

24:51.120 --> 24:52.120
 What is that?

24:52.120 --> 24:53.120
 What's the difference?

24:53.120 --> 24:54.500
 What's the historical context here?

24:54.500 --> 24:55.800
 What is World War II again?

24:55.800 --> 24:59.840
 And then, let's do it for some...

24:59.840 --> 25:05.840
 We don't have to go to World War I, the result of which actually seeded World War II in some

25:05.840 --> 25:06.840
 respect.

25:06.840 --> 25:07.840
 Yes.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.820
 There's a long history, yes.

25:09.820 --> 25:11.320
 But let's start with World War II.

25:11.320 --> 25:20.960
 So when Hitler came to power, he and his leadership decided that the Germans needed more what

25:20.960 --> 25:26.120
 they call Lebensraum, that means room to live.

25:26.120 --> 25:35.160
 And they would start expanding and they went into France, they took Belgium, the Netherlands,

25:35.160 --> 25:44.240
 they annexed Austria and got a piece of Czechoslovakia.

25:44.240 --> 25:53.240
 And then they decided to march into the Soviet Union after they took Poland.

25:53.240 --> 25:55.280
 Cut up Poland together with the Soviet Union.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.280
 Yes.

25:56.280 --> 25:57.280
 They were friends.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.280
 Yes.

25:58.280 --> 26:03.280
 There was a nonaggression pact that was signed by Ribbentrop and Molotov, right?

26:03.280 --> 26:06.280
 I think both parties knew that eventually they would fall apart.

26:06.280 --> 26:14.080
 But at the time, it gave the Soviet Union a little more piece of Poland and a little

26:14.080 --> 26:19.840
 more time to prepare what they thought might happen down the road.

26:19.840 --> 26:29.320
 And the Germans had the time and the ability to pretty much conquer all of Western Europe.

26:29.320 --> 26:33.140
 Do you think Stalin really knew that it's gonna fall apart?

26:33.140 --> 26:36.140
 Why would somebody like Stalin trust somebody like Hitler?

26:36.140 --> 26:42.640
 But why did he blunder so bad not to read the intelligence that was coming his way?

26:42.640 --> 26:43.640
 Oh, he doesn't...

26:43.640 --> 26:46.000
 The troops are amassing on the border of the Soviet Union.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.240
 He didn't trust his own intelligence apparatus.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.240
 Oh, boy.

26:49.240 --> 26:52.540
 Here's one example.

26:52.540 --> 26:59.960
 There was a German communist who went underground when Hitler took over and he went to Japan

26:59.960 --> 27:00.960
 as a journalist.

27:00.960 --> 27:03.320
 His name is Richard Sorge.

27:03.320 --> 27:11.680
 Richard Sorge had really, really good intel about what the Japanese would do and not do.

27:11.680 --> 27:18.080
 I forgot exactly what it was, but it came to Moscow and Stalin totally ignored it.

27:18.080 --> 27:26.680
 And when Sorge was captured by the Japanese, the Soviet Union denied that he was one of

27:26.680 --> 27:35.400
 them there, so he was executed, the paranoia, again, does a lot of damage.

27:35.400 --> 27:41.600
 When you don't believe your own intelligence apparatus, why bother having one?

27:41.600 --> 27:44.960
 Yeah, I mean, there...

27:44.960 --> 27:49.000
 But I'm sure there's contradictory information coming in from the intelligence apparatus,

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
 so it's difficult.

27:50.000 --> 27:55.720
 I mean, first of all, nobody likes to be disagreed with, especially when you become more and

27:55.720 --> 28:00.760
 more powerful, and then the intelligence apparatus is probably giving information you don't like.

28:00.760 --> 28:09.460
 It's often negative information about, basically, information that says that the decisions you

28:09.460 --> 28:15.600
 made in the past are not great decisions, and that's a difficult truth to deal with.

28:15.600 --> 28:26.200
 So in the modern times, if we hop around briefly, Vladimir Putin has been not happy with the

28:26.200 --> 28:34.040
 intelligence of the FSB, thereby, at least if you read the news, choosing to put more

28:34.040 --> 28:39.920
 priority to the GRU for the intelligence in Ukraine.

28:39.920 --> 28:46.720
 But I guess I suppose the same story happens there, as it does throughout history, is paranoia.

28:46.720 --> 28:59.240
 I give you an example that comes from a very reliable source, and that my best German friend

28:59.240 --> 29:04.560
 worked as a chemist in the Stasi, East German intelligence.

29:04.560 --> 29:15.520
 And he eventually, he rose to the rank of major and was in charge of the forgery department.

29:15.520 --> 29:20.140
 It's very likely that he made passports that I use to travel.

29:20.140 --> 29:24.640
 He was aware that there was intelligence that was collected.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.480
 The Stasi was really good.

29:26.480 --> 29:32.820
 They had about a thousand people in West Germany, undercover agents, some of them in government,

29:32.820 --> 29:37.920
 and the central committee of the party, the decision makers ignored it because it didn't

29:37.920 --> 29:43.600
 quite fit in their worldview, it didn't quite fit into their plans.

29:43.600 --> 29:53.380
 So and one delicious thing that I just want to add on to this, when Gorbachev wrote his

29:53.380 --> 30:01.600
 book about Perestroika and Glasnost, the East German rulers did not like it.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.520
 They were much, much more orthodox.

30:03.520 --> 30:09.240
 So they had to print the books in translation, guess where they wound up.

30:09.240 --> 30:13.480
 They were piled up in the hallways of the Stasi.

30:13.480 --> 30:16.680
 They bought the entire print run.

30:16.680 --> 30:19.540
 It's fascinating.

30:19.540 --> 30:20.820
 So but let's backtrack.

30:20.820 --> 30:26.300
 So Operation Barbarossa, invasion of Hitler to the Soviet Union, and then hopefully that

30:26.300 --> 30:30.540
 leads us all the way to East Germany, West Germany after the end of the war.

30:30.540 --> 30:36.280
 So what happened was the Soviet Union rolled into the eastern part of Germany and the Western

30:36.280 --> 30:49.240
 allies took a larger chunk, which was eventually, it was occupied by the three allies, the French,

30:49.240 --> 30:55.440
 the English and the Americans, and the eastern part was occupied by Soviet troops.

30:55.440 --> 31:01.000
 And the Soviet troops actually conquered Berlin.

31:01.000 --> 31:09.200
 But in a contract, they decided that Berlin would be ruled by the four allies and they

31:09.200 --> 31:15.960
 all had free access to that city.

31:15.960 --> 31:25.360
 I was born in the East German part, which very quickly became ruled by communists, socialists,

31:25.360 --> 31:31.200
 the Communist Party and the Socialist Party United, but the leaders of that new party

31:31.200 --> 31:32.200
 were all communists.

31:32.200 --> 31:34.400
 It's nevertheless called democratic.

31:34.400 --> 31:42.120
 Yes, German Democratic Republic, which was formed a couple of months after I was born.

31:42.120 --> 31:49.600
 I was born into a remote southeastern corner of East Germany.

31:49.600 --> 31:54.520
 And interestingly enough, genetically, I'm only half German.

31:54.520 --> 31:58.720
 The other half is Czech and Polish.

31:58.720 --> 32:07.160
 Because where I grew up, I could walk to the Nysa River, which was the border with Poland,

32:07.160 --> 32:11.960
 and it was only about an hour by bus to get to the Czech border.

32:11.960 --> 32:14.640
 So that's why I'm a mix.

32:14.640 --> 32:20.760
 So okay, so East Germany after the war was communist, socialist, and then the West Germany

32:20.760 --> 32:25.400
 was representing the Western world with democracy.

32:25.400 --> 32:35.200
 And what the United States did, this was really, really very forward looking, very strategic,

32:35.200 --> 32:41.520
 the Marshall Plan to rebuild the economy in the West as compared to what the Soviet Union

32:41.520 --> 32:42.520
 did.

32:42.520 --> 32:48.760
 Whatever they hadn't destroyed on the way in, they took with them on the way out for

32:48.760 --> 32:52.360
 reparations because they had every right to do that.

32:52.360 --> 32:59.280
 But it was not a good idea because East Germany was always behind in economic development

32:59.280 --> 33:01.560
 to their Western counterpart.

33:01.560 --> 33:08.160
 So when you were young, as today, but when you were young, you were clearly an exceptional

33:08.160 --> 33:09.160
 student.

33:09.160 --> 33:10.160
 Yeah.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.880
 You're a brilliant academic superstar.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.900
 Let's go to your childhood.

33:14.900 --> 33:21.800
 What's the fond memory from childhood that you have in being woken up to the beauty of

33:21.800 --> 33:27.640
 this world and sort of being curious about all the mysteries around you that I think

33:27.640 --> 33:33.480
 ultimately lead to academic success?

33:33.480 --> 33:35.040
 Or was it...

33:35.040 --> 33:38.520
 The fondest memory that comes to mind is my first kiss.

33:38.520 --> 33:39.520
 How's that?

33:39.520 --> 33:44.560
 Do you want to go to the details of that?

33:44.560 --> 33:47.220
 What did you make of that kiss?

33:47.220 --> 33:51.400
 What did that teach you about yourself and human nature and all that?

33:51.400 --> 33:53.240
 It taught me only in hindsight.

33:53.240 --> 33:57.640
 At the time, I was just like, my God, I was head over heels in love.

33:57.640 --> 34:00.720
 I was 16 years old.

34:00.720 --> 34:05.160
 And I knew in those days, I admired girls.

34:05.160 --> 34:10.720
 I knew the girls were like sort of magical beings.

34:10.720 --> 34:13.560
 They were not capable of doing evil things.

34:13.560 --> 34:16.160
 They were beautiful and they had to be adored.

34:16.160 --> 34:20.100
 And one of them actually loved me too.

34:20.100 --> 34:23.040
 She came after me initially.

34:23.040 --> 34:25.760
 And that too was magical for you.

34:25.760 --> 34:28.800
 Oh my God, yeah.

34:28.800 --> 34:33.560
 And literally, I dedicated...

34:33.560 --> 34:34.780
 That's when I started studying.

34:34.780 --> 34:39.680
 Up until that point, I just did whatever I had to do to be in A minus students.

34:39.680 --> 34:41.000
 And that's when I started studying.

34:41.000 --> 34:48.040
 And every A that I got, I dedicated to her, sometimes explicitly, because I knew I was

34:48.040 --> 34:50.240
 going to take care of her as I grew up.

34:50.240 --> 34:54.120
 So you're going to have to work hard in this world to be somebody that could be adored

34:54.120 --> 34:55.840
 by those you love.

34:55.840 --> 34:57.200
 Yes, you're right.

34:57.200 --> 35:05.800
 You know that kiss, the next day, I was running around in school with a grin on my face.

35:05.800 --> 35:09.920
 And maybe that in some way, that grin never fades.

35:09.920 --> 35:15.400
 So what about the heartbreak that followed?

35:15.400 --> 35:27.240
 But just to expand on this a little more, because that passion that I had was an indication

35:27.240 --> 35:30.560
 that eventually love would play a big role in my life.

35:30.560 --> 35:31.560
 I wasn't aware of it.

35:31.560 --> 35:34.760
 I was just directed at this one girl.

35:34.760 --> 35:39.840
 But you understood that that feeling that taught you something, like that you're somebody

35:39.840 --> 35:41.840
 that can feel those things.

35:41.840 --> 35:46.440
 And that's a strong part of who you are.

35:46.440 --> 35:50.400
 And therefore, it will also be a part of directing your life trajectory.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.400
 Yeah.

35:51.400 --> 35:55.400
 So we were an item for two years.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.920
 I lost my virginity.

35:57.920 --> 36:01.920
 She was not a virgin at the time.

36:01.920 --> 36:09.760
 My competitor was, he studied medicine in college already.

36:09.760 --> 36:11.880
 In which ways was he better than you?

36:11.880 --> 36:12.880
 He wasn't.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.680
 He was older, and he was more experienced.

36:14.680 --> 36:18.000
 And he was going to be a doctor.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.560
 But I was there, and he was not.

36:21.560 --> 36:24.520
 The presence wins.

36:24.520 --> 36:25.920
 But you still had big dreams.

36:25.920 --> 36:28.520
 You wanted to be a tenured professor.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.520
 Yes, yes.

36:29.520 --> 36:32.400
 So you still want to outdo that guy.

36:32.400 --> 36:33.400
 Oh, yeah.

36:33.400 --> 36:39.200
 And she eventually told me that he was not in the picture anymore.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.120
 So it was back and forth, back and forth.

36:41.120 --> 36:48.880
 And our senior year, we were an item, and I was just dreaming of the future.

36:48.880 --> 36:55.000
 But we didn't figure out that in those days, if she went to college in Berlin and I went

36:55.000 --> 37:06.580
 to college in Jena, and the distance between the two cities was too much for a weekend

37:06.580 --> 37:13.520
 visit, public transportation was very slow, and nobody had cars.

37:13.520 --> 37:18.160
 So the circumstance of life, you drifted apart.

37:18.160 --> 37:23.160
 And so we interacted with a couple of letters, and then I got the goodbye letter.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.960
 Oh, my God.

37:24.960 --> 37:26.680
 That hurt?

37:26.680 --> 37:30.720
 I can still feel it.

37:30.720 --> 37:31.920
 That's a good thing.

37:31.920 --> 37:33.960
 You could feel the pain.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.080
 That's still part of love.

37:36.080 --> 37:39.160
 It's that the pain of loss is still part of love.

37:39.160 --> 37:41.880
 And then you kind of change that.

37:41.880 --> 37:46.640
 You shape it, and you give that love in deeper, more profound ways to future people.

37:46.640 --> 37:47.900
 That's very well put.

37:47.900 --> 37:51.840
 But at the time, it emptied me out.

37:51.840 --> 38:00.640
 If I had a tendency to have suicidal thoughts, I might have killed myself.

38:00.640 --> 38:04.800
 Would you say that was one of the darker moments of your life?

38:04.800 --> 38:07.400
 Let me see.

38:07.400 --> 38:09.120
 As a single moment, yes.

38:09.120 --> 38:19.200
 So I still remember we had a mail slot in the front door, and I wasn't expecting a letter

38:19.200 --> 38:20.640
 any day, and there was the letter.

38:20.640 --> 38:29.060
 I go upstairs into my bedroom, and I open it, and I read it, and just like the life

38:29.060 --> 38:30.060
 went out of me.

38:30.060 --> 38:33.800
 You're just there alone, and you have to experience this pain alone.

38:33.800 --> 38:37.600
 And now you're deeply alone in this world.

38:37.600 --> 38:46.120
 Yes, because there was no emotional relationship with my parents.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.480
 I literally had nobody.

38:47.480 --> 38:51.520
 So this love you have in you had no place to go.

38:51.520 --> 38:55.060
 It was choked off, all right?

38:55.060 --> 39:02.960
 But what I did was I wanted to go on, right?

39:02.960 --> 39:07.560
 And so I threw myself into the study of chemistry.

39:07.560 --> 39:13.920
 I outworked all of my fellow students in a big way.

39:13.920 --> 39:20.240
 I worked my ass off, and since I was pretty smart, too, I just aced practically everything.

39:20.240 --> 39:24.120
 And for the first two years in college, and look, we go to college, there are all these

39:24.120 --> 39:26.080
 pretty girls, and there's dances and everything.

39:26.080 --> 39:32.800
 We had this great student club where I didn't look at any girls.

39:32.800 --> 39:38.160
 Eventually I knew I was going to, you know, want to have female companionship, but love?

39:38.160 --> 39:39.160
 Uh uh.

39:39.160 --> 39:40.160
 No more.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.160
 That hurts.

39:41.160 --> 39:43.160
 There's a song that goes, love hurts.

39:43.160 --> 39:44.840
 Yeah, I know that one.

39:44.840 --> 39:45.840
 That's true.

39:45.840 --> 39:50.760
 There's actually many songs that have a similar message, yes.

39:50.760 --> 39:58.240
 So during that time, during your excellence, just being an exceptional student of chemistry,

39:58.240 --> 39:59.240
 let's go to your story.

39:59.240 --> 40:06.200
 So in your book, Deep Undercover, My Secret Life and Tangled Allegiances as a KGB Spy

40:06.200 --> 40:12.120
 in America, and in the really, really excellent podcast series that I've been listening to,

40:12.120 --> 40:15.120
 people should definitely listen to, it's called The Agent.

40:15.120 --> 40:19.760
 You document your time as a KGB spy before, during, and after.

40:19.760 --> 40:28.280
 Can you tell the story of when you first were contacted by the KGB, how you were invited,

40:28.280 --> 40:30.440
 the offer to join was made?

40:30.440 --> 40:36.160
 Well, it was a big surprise, and I never thought of myself as a potential agent.

40:36.160 --> 40:42.640
 You know, I was going to be a tenured professor and join the ruling elite, because in Europe,

40:42.640 --> 40:44.360
 tenured professors are few.

40:44.360 --> 40:48.840
 It's not like in the United States, you know, anybody who teaches at colleges has a title

40:48.840 --> 40:49.840
 of professor.

40:49.840 --> 40:50.840
 Easy now.

40:50.840 --> 40:51.840
 It's true.

40:51.840 --> 40:52.840
 That's not a criticism.

40:52.840 --> 40:53.840
 That's 100%.

40:53.840 --> 41:00.640
 So we should also clarify that, tenured professor or not, it is a very prestigious position

41:00.640 --> 41:03.440
 throughout history of Europe.

41:03.440 --> 41:09.520
 I would say, especially communists, I don't actually know the full landscape of the respect,

41:09.520 --> 41:13.560
 but at least in the Soviet Union where I grew up, it's a prestigious position.

41:13.560 --> 41:14.560
 Absolutely was.

41:14.560 --> 41:22.520
 And the town of Yanuk had about 100,000 people live there, and I would, it's a wild guess,

41:22.520 --> 41:26.880
 but maybe 30 tenured professors, and they were part of the ruling elite.

41:26.880 --> 41:32.360
 I was trying to do as much as I can to live the good life, right?

41:32.360 --> 41:35.760
 You know, have access to things that are nice.

41:35.760 --> 41:41.840
 Yeah, but I think the powerful thing about being a professor in that context of East

41:41.840 --> 41:44.540
 Germany is the prestige.

41:44.540 --> 41:47.240
 And the feeling of superiority.

41:47.240 --> 41:49.600
 You know, I was full of myself.

41:49.600 --> 41:57.360
 You know, when you are the best of the best, and in my third year I received a scholarship,

41:57.360 --> 42:05.160
 the Karl Marx Scholarship, that was limited to 100 concurrent recipients in the country.

42:05.160 --> 42:08.400
 So my God, you know, I was full of myself.

42:08.400 --> 42:11.720
 I believed in myself, hook, line, and sinker.

42:11.720 --> 42:22.760
 And I was also, I got a lot of accolades from teachers and fellow students.

42:22.760 --> 42:29.020
 They were feeding the ego, the old, I mean, you have to believe in yourself often when

42:29.020 --> 42:32.400
 you're young to truly, to excel.

42:32.400 --> 42:34.900
 And you sure as heck did.

42:34.900 --> 42:39.520
 But you know, as a balance, you need a mentor, somebody who puts things in perspective, and

42:39.520 --> 42:41.160
 I didn't have one.

42:41.160 --> 42:44.000
 My father was a nonentity and nobody else.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
 They all looked up to me.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.960
 I was an up and coming guy, right?

42:47.960 --> 42:50.400
 So there's no father figure that put you in your place.

42:50.400 --> 42:51.440
 Not at all.

42:51.440 --> 42:53.200
 And I give you one extreme example.

42:53.200 --> 43:00.240
 It was down the road when I fathered a child out of wedlock.

43:00.240 --> 43:03.360
 That was in my fifth year, I believe.

43:03.360 --> 43:07.120
 The Communist Party in East Germany was very moralistic.

43:07.120 --> 43:13.680
 If you did that, they would have a talk with you and give you whatever, a severe reprimand.

43:13.680 --> 43:16.560
 Nobody even mentioned a word about this.

43:16.560 --> 43:20.400
 So yeah, so this is how this ego gets nurtured.

43:20.400 --> 43:25.280
 But anyway, getting back to how the KGB came in contact.

43:25.280 --> 43:34.320
 So they most likely got knowledge of me by, you know, looking at Stasi records.

43:34.320 --> 43:35.320
 What's Stasi?

43:35.320 --> 43:42.280
 That was East German secret police, Staatssicherheit, security for the state.

43:42.280 --> 43:45.760
 There's that word security again.

43:45.760 --> 43:50.720
 And they pretty much kept a record on everybody in the country.

43:50.720 --> 43:55.920
 And so when you look through this, and this is what the KGB was looking for.

43:55.920 --> 44:00.000
 They were looking for candidates, particularly for this kind of job that they had in mind

44:00.000 --> 44:09.200
 for me, for candidates who were not, you know, in their mid 20s, who were not fully developed

44:09.200 --> 44:17.240
 yet, but mature enough to get there and still young enough, right?

44:17.240 --> 44:20.200
 Because at that level of maturity, you can test whether they can handle this kind of

44:20.200 --> 44:21.200
 job.

44:21.200 --> 44:22.200
 Yes.

44:22.200 --> 44:23.200
 Absolutely right.

44:23.200 --> 44:32.000
 And one day I got a knock on my door and my dorm room door was on a Saturday.

44:32.000 --> 44:37.400
 And they knew that I was by myself.

44:37.400 --> 44:39.680
 How did they know it?

44:39.680 --> 44:43.600
 We had a, I pieced this together.

44:43.600 --> 44:51.220
 We had an exchange student from the Soviet Union, and he was next door to me.

44:51.220 --> 44:54.240
 And he befriended me.

44:54.240 --> 44:57.360
 So he got to know me a little bit.

44:57.360 --> 45:02.600
 And the pattern was that my roommate would always go home for the weekend.

45:02.600 --> 45:08.960
 And of course they also knew which door to knock on, even though there were no nameplates.

45:08.960 --> 45:11.000
 Somebody knocks.

45:11.000 --> 45:17.000
 And I knew it was a stranger because if it had been a student, the pattern was that we

45:17.000 --> 45:18.680
 would knock on the door and then go in.

45:18.680 --> 45:22.000
 We wouldn't wait for somebody to let us in.

45:22.000 --> 45:26.880
 So I waited for 10 seconds and he didn't come in.

45:26.880 --> 45:28.600
 I knew that it was a stranger.

45:28.600 --> 45:30.640
 I said, come on in.

45:30.640 --> 45:34.640
 And in came a person who spoke fluent German.

45:34.640 --> 45:36.440
 So that was not a KGB guy.

45:36.440 --> 45:40.140
 That was a collaborator.

45:40.140 --> 45:42.360
 And so he started making a bunch of small talk.

45:42.360 --> 45:52.000
 He introduced himself as a representative of Carl Zeiss Jena, which was the optics company

45:52.000 --> 45:58.520
 that made really, really good optical instruments, was one of the best in the world.

45:58.520 --> 46:05.200
 So it's like the super prestigious company in that place.

46:05.200 --> 46:11.860
 And he said that he was a representative of that company and he would just want to find

46:11.860 --> 46:16.720
 out what my plans were after graduating from college.

46:16.720 --> 46:22.800
 And at that point I knew he wasn't from Carl Zeiss Jena because in those days there was

46:22.800 --> 46:25.000
 no recruitment.

46:25.000 --> 46:34.000
 When you were done, if you were in the top 10% of the graduates, you would most likely

46:34.000 --> 46:37.720
 pick to stay and get a doctorate.

46:37.720 --> 46:40.400
 And the rest of them were assigned.

46:40.400 --> 46:43.180
 You had no choice.

46:43.180 --> 46:48.100
 So that guy was an idiot.

46:48.100 --> 46:50.880
 He didn't know the basics about...

46:50.880 --> 46:57.960
 You interviewed him a little bit to understand, like feel out, is this guy full of shit?

46:57.960 --> 47:00.560
 Because yeah, he's a stranger showing up to your dorm room.

47:00.560 --> 47:06.360
 I knew that at that point, I knew he was a Stasi, which is wrong, but it doesn't matter

47:06.360 --> 47:10.200
 because he was German and I had no idea that the KGB would be involved.

47:10.200 --> 47:17.800
 So sorry to pause briefly, did you have a sense, did people know that there's a Stasi

47:17.800 --> 47:23.920
 type of organization, that there is a large number of people doing this kind of work in

47:23.920 --> 47:27.320
 East Germany in order for you to make that guess?

47:27.320 --> 47:31.240
 Yeah, we knew that the Stasi existed.

47:31.240 --> 47:40.800
 We even had our James Bond, we had a series called the Invisible Visor where a Stasi employee

47:40.800 --> 47:45.040
 in East German would go into West Germany and hunt down Nazis.

47:45.040 --> 47:47.520
 So yes, the Stasi was known to be there.

47:47.520 --> 47:51.600
 And admired in part or feared or both?

47:51.600 --> 47:55.040
 I thought they were necessary and I admired them.

47:55.040 --> 47:56.040
 James Bond.

47:56.040 --> 48:01.520
 Yes, the reason I did so because I had no information to the contrary.

48:01.520 --> 48:16.680
 I never knew anybody personally or even somewhat removed who was followed by the Stasi, was

48:16.680 --> 48:17.680
 put in jail.

48:17.680 --> 48:19.720
 I had no clue.

48:19.720 --> 48:24.420
 I had no clue that they did a lot of damage and that they were doing a lot of surveillance

48:24.420 --> 48:30.240
 of the East German population the same way the KGB did for the Soviet Union.

48:30.240 --> 48:38.400
 So for me to be talking to somebody from the Stasi, it raised my interest.

48:38.400 --> 48:44.220
 I was curious what comes next because I sort of knew something interesting would be coming

48:44.220 --> 48:49.160
 at me and I had no other thoughts about that at that point.

48:49.160 --> 48:56.360
 So when he was finally, when he went for the kill by reversing himself, he said, you know,

48:56.360 --> 49:00.920
 I got to tell you that I really, I really am not from Karl Stasi, you know, I'm from

49:00.920 --> 49:01.920
 the government.

49:01.920 --> 49:02.920
 Okay.

49:02.920 --> 49:05.540
 Thank you for pointing that out.

49:05.540 --> 49:11.920
 And then he asked this question, he says, can you imagine to one day work for the government?

49:11.920 --> 49:14.480
 And so I gave a pretty clever answer.

49:14.480 --> 49:17.680
 I said, yes, but not as a chemist.

49:17.680 --> 49:21.480
 So I answered the question that he didn't ask.

49:21.480 --> 49:23.280
 I helped him out.

49:23.280 --> 49:31.320
 So we made an arrangement to meet for lunch, which in Germany is the main meal at the number

49:31.320 --> 49:35.520
 one restaurant in Vienna, you know, I still remember what I ate.

49:35.520 --> 49:36.700
 What was that?

49:36.700 --> 49:43.120
 Rump steak with butter on top and French fries, it was my favorite.

49:43.120 --> 49:48.920
 Anyway, so when I get to the restaurant, I saw this fellow sitting in the back there

49:48.920 --> 49:52.520
 at the table and there was another person at the table.

49:52.520 --> 49:58.600
 So I was a little bit hesitant because in those days it was not unusual for perfect

49:58.600 --> 50:04.720
 strangers to share a table because there wasn't enough tables and chairs and so forth.

50:04.720 --> 50:09.860
 So I didn't know if I could approach him, but he got up and came to me and he took me

50:09.860 --> 50:15.160
 to the table and he said, I want to introduce Herman.

50:15.160 --> 50:18.280
 We work with our Soviet comrades.

50:18.280 --> 50:21.160
 Aha, KGB.

50:21.160 --> 50:22.160
 And then he disappeared.

50:22.160 --> 50:24.080
 He says, I got something else to do.

50:24.080 --> 50:26.440
 I never knew his name.

50:26.440 --> 50:29.640
 He just handed me over to the KGB.

50:29.640 --> 50:35.300
 What was the relationship between the KGB and Astazies as collaborators, close collaborators

50:35.300 --> 50:37.700
 or just distant associates?

50:37.700 --> 50:43.760
 They were pretty close collaborators as I told you that they bought forged documents

50:43.760 --> 50:47.800
 that the Germans made because the Germans were better at forgery.

50:47.800 --> 50:54.240
 They also exchanged information, but they didn't trust each other 100% and I tell you

50:54.240 --> 50:56.040
 why I know that.

50:56.040 --> 51:01.280
 So they recruited me to send me to West Germany.

51:01.280 --> 51:04.360
 As I already said, East Germany had a thousand agents over there.

51:04.360 --> 51:06.760
 Why would they want to have their own?

51:06.760 --> 51:07.760
 Yeah.

51:07.760 --> 51:08.760
 Yeah.

51:08.760 --> 51:09.760
 Okay.

51:09.760 --> 51:13.200
 This is a fascinating internal and external dynamic of distrust.

51:13.200 --> 51:14.200
 Yeah.

51:14.200 --> 51:15.200
 Okay.

51:15.200 --> 51:19.160
 So there you are welcomed by the KGB.

51:19.160 --> 51:21.320
 When did the offer, the invite come?

51:21.320 --> 51:22.680
 Well, that took a while.

51:22.680 --> 51:29.760
 So Herman and I had an unofficial relationship for about a year and a half.

51:29.760 --> 51:39.520
 I would meet him once a week, once every two weeks, initially in his car, but then he took

51:39.520 --> 51:49.080
 me to a conspirational flat that was an apartment that was occupied by a party member, a lady,

51:49.080 --> 51:50.520
 single lady.

51:50.520 --> 51:55.720
 When we came in, she would leave, she left us tea and cookies and then we could freely

51:55.720 --> 51:56.720
 talk.

51:56.720 --> 52:03.060
 He also at that time gave me some West German literature magazines to read, which was of

52:03.060 --> 52:04.680
 course forbidden.

52:04.680 --> 52:11.280
 So I'm starting to feel somewhat special and as we were talking about what they had in

52:11.280 --> 52:17.840
 mind for me in general, I knew that I was going to be even more special because I would

52:17.840 --> 52:20.640
 be above the law.

52:20.640 --> 52:27.280
 I would operate outside the law of the countries I would go to as well as East Germany because

52:27.280 --> 52:35.680
 the magazines and eventually when I joined up, they told me I had better watch West German

52:35.680 --> 52:43.960
 television, which was also not explicitly prohibited, but it was something that could

52:43.960 --> 52:44.960
 get you in trouble.

52:44.960 --> 52:48.440
 So on many levels, you're super special, you're the James Bond.

52:48.440 --> 52:49.440
 Yes.

52:49.440 --> 52:50.440
 Yes.

52:50.440 --> 52:55.240
 What was that recruitment testing process like?

52:55.240 --> 53:01.600
 Testing whether you have what it takes to be a KGB agent?

53:01.600 --> 53:16.160
 First of all, we had very in depth talks, Herman and I, about life and I still am very

53:16.160 --> 53:19.880
 honest in sharing my feelings.

53:19.880 --> 53:21.600
 Philosophical or personal?

53:21.600 --> 53:22.600
 Personal.

53:22.600 --> 53:26.920
 I even told him that I was shy around the girls.

53:26.920 --> 53:29.640
 He was giving you relationship advice or what?

53:29.640 --> 53:30.640
 How old was he?

53:30.640 --> 53:31.640
 So what was the dynamic?

53:31.640 --> 53:33.680
 Can you tell me, was it a father, son?

53:33.680 --> 53:34.680
 No, older brother.

53:34.680 --> 53:35.680
 Older brother.

53:35.680 --> 53:36.680
 Older brother.

53:36.680 --> 53:42.500
 Yeah, he was maybe in his early to mid 30s and I was maybe 10 years younger.

53:42.500 --> 53:43.880
 And what languages did he speak?

53:43.880 --> 53:46.680
 He spoke German pretty well.

53:46.680 --> 53:48.160
 But he's originally from Russia?

53:48.160 --> 53:50.780
 Yeah, with a Russian accent.

53:50.780 --> 53:57.040
 So I got in trouble one time with him when I asked him, is your real name German?

53:57.040 --> 53:58.040
 He didn't like that.

53:58.040 --> 53:59.240
 He didn't like it.

53:59.240 --> 54:00.240
 Was he good with girls?

54:00.240 --> 54:01.240
 No, no.

54:01.240 --> 54:07.680
 I remember what he told me, he says, you've got to understand one thing, they're looking

54:07.680 --> 54:10.080
 for guys too.

54:10.080 --> 54:11.080
 That's all.

54:11.080 --> 54:13.120
 Oh, girls are looking for guys too?

54:13.120 --> 54:14.120
 Yeah.

54:14.120 --> 54:15.120
 Absolutely.

54:15.120 --> 54:16.120
 It's a competitive game.

54:16.120 --> 54:17.120
 Yeah.

54:17.120 --> 54:18.120
 Yeah.

54:18.120 --> 54:23.520
 So that little flame of love that we talked about and all the shapes that it takes in

54:23.520 --> 54:29.280
 our life, did he talk to you about that, that that could be taken advantage of, that that

54:29.280 --> 54:32.040
 could be used or was it implied?

54:32.040 --> 54:36.920
 Yeah, but not in, it was not very focused, not in great detail.

54:36.920 --> 54:43.360
 So let's, so we talked about personal stuff and you know, like, dislikes, he gave me tasks.

54:43.360 --> 54:50.360
 For instance, when my friend and I hitchhiked from East Germany all the way down to Bulgaria,

54:50.360 --> 54:53.280
 he told me to write a report about it, what I saw.

54:53.280 --> 55:01.160
 So fundamentally he wanted to see how well I can write and how well I can report, how

55:01.160 --> 55:04.300
 well I observe.

55:04.300 --> 55:08.120
 He also asked me to write some profiles about fellow students.

55:08.120 --> 55:12.940
 I don't believe that was for them to give him to the Stasi, it was just like, how well

55:12.940 --> 55:14.800
 do I characterize people?

55:14.800 --> 55:21.200
 That's important when you're talking about, when I was in the US, active in the US I operated

55:21.200 --> 55:22.200
 as a spotter.

55:22.200 --> 55:23.200
 So I did exactly that.

55:23.200 --> 55:26.400
 I wrote profiles about people.

55:26.400 --> 55:36.320
 He also gave me some tasks to do that were rather unpleasant.

55:36.320 --> 55:42.720
 He would give me an address and a name of the people who lived at the address and he

55:42.720 --> 55:49.320
 told me to go there, ring the doorbell and find out something about a relative who lived

55:49.320 --> 55:52.580
 in West Germany.

55:52.580 --> 55:55.040
 That is undercover exploration, right?

55:55.040 --> 56:01.600
 So you go, you make up a story and somehow win the confidence of your target to tell

56:01.600 --> 56:04.080
 you something that you want to know.

56:04.080 --> 56:06.040
 Was that, did that come naturally to you?

56:06.040 --> 56:07.080
 No, no, I hated it.

56:07.080 --> 56:09.760
 The charisma involved, which part did you hate?

56:09.760 --> 56:13.440
 Charisma, I think, I didn't know that I had it.

56:13.440 --> 56:15.640
 It took you some time to discover.

56:15.640 --> 56:21.320
 You know, I was, I always was and I still am to some degree a bit shy.

56:21.320 --> 56:26.440
 I lost a lot of the shyness after moving to the South because, here in the United States,

56:26.440 --> 56:31.480
 because you don't have to be shy, you know.

56:31.480 --> 56:33.720
 You can let your love shine.

56:33.720 --> 56:34.720
 That's exactly right.

56:34.720 --> 56:38.840
 So, but anyway, I hated doing that, but I did it well.

56:38.840 --> 56:39.840
 I still remember.

56:39.840 --> 56:46.160
 So I, in those days, I had a beard and I rang the bell and...

56:46.160 --> 56:47.720
 Tall, handsome fella.

56:47.720 --> 56:48.720
 Yeah.

56:48.720 --> 56:54.880
 And I looked the part, I said, I'm a sociology student and I'm doing a survey and I asked

56:54.880 --> 56:58.720
 a whole bunch of questions, would you like to answer the questions?

56:58.720 --> 57:00.760
 No problem.

57:00.760 --> 57:09.240
 And then I directed the conversation to the lady's private life and she actually gave

57:09.240 --> 57:10.240
 me information.

57:10.240 --> 57:13.280
 She volunteered information that I wanted to know.

57:13.280 --> 57:14.280
 Beautiful.

57:14.280 --> 57:15.280
 I did well.

57:15.280 --> 57:22.640
 And the other one that I didn't like, but I also did well with, when Herman drove me

57:22.640 --> 57:27.600
 around the city and showed me a building and he said, find out what organization is in

57:27.600 --> 57:29.720
 there, what they do.

57:29.720 --> 57:33.960
 We get to know some people and I did that pretty well also.

57:33.960 --> 57:40.440
 You know, you have to be inventive, you know, to come up with a cover story and I've always

57:40.440 --> 57:48.720
 been quite inventive, you know, I'm a storyteller at heart and that, I didn't know it then,

57:48.720 --> 57:49.720
 but you know, I...

57:49.720 --> 57:52.000
 But there was still something unpleasant about it.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
 Yes.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
 Yes.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
 Which part was unpleasant?

57:55.000 --> 57:59.040
 Well, the shyness and then, you know, I wasn't very comfortable lying.

57:59.040 --> 58:08.560
 I became comfortable down the road, but you know, I was brutally honest and never hid

58:08.560 --> 58:12.000
 anything of me.

58:12.000 --> 58:21.240
 But you know, over time you lose that uncomfortable feeling and you rationalize that you've got

58:21.240 --> 58:22.240
 to do it.

58:22.240 --> 58:23.840
 There's only one way, right?

58:23.840 --> 58:25.120
 And you're serving a good cause.

58:25.120 --> 58:28.320
 So you were talking to Herman for a year and a half?

58:28.320 --> 58:29.360
 A year and a half.

58:29.360 --> 58:31.280
 And then how did that progress?

58:31.280 --> 58:32.280
 Yes.

58:32.280 --> 58:40.520
 So he finally, I guess he sent a report to headquarters in Berlin and then he sent me

58:40.520 --> 58:45.160
 on a three week, quote unquote, practice trip to Berlin.

58:45.160 --> 58:53.640
 This was the first time when I had like a conspiratorial meeting where I had an address

58:53.640 --> 58:59.080
 and a time and a code phrase and I met another agent.

58:59.080 --> 59:01.540
 His name was Boris.

59:01.540 --> 59:02.840
 These names were meaningless.

59:02.840 --> 59:04.800
 They were all like cover names, right?

59:04.800 --> 59:06.480
 So what was the code and the meaning?

59:06.480 --> 59:07.480
 What was then?

59:07.480 --> 59:08.640
 Can you give a little more detail?

59:08.640 --> 59:10.420
 That code I don't remember.

59:10.420 --> 59:13.240
 Not the code, but like, what do you mean by code?

59:13.240 --> 59:14.240
 So what was...

59:14.240 --> 59:22.360
 I tell you, the code we used when I met while I was active, I would approach the other person

59:22.360 --> 59:25.620
 who I thought may be the person I want to meet.

59:25.620 --> 59:36.000
 We both had something with us or on us to make us more likely to be the right person.

59:36.000 --> 59:45.880
 And I would ask him the following questions, excuse me, I'm looking for Susan Green.

59:45.880 --> 59:48.680
 And he would answer, yes, you must be David.

59:48.680 --> 59:50.400
 Stupid.

59:50.400 --> 59:56.440
 If I ask a stranger, they would look at me, well, how could I help you?

59:56.440 --> 59:58.680
 So I know it's the wrong guy.

59:58.680 --> 1:00:03.360
 It's just a low probability that the right thing would be said, so it's a nice entry.

1:00:03.360 --> 1:00:08.280
 And it seems like a safe statement if it's not the right person, it would just come off

1:00:08.280 --> 1:00:10.840
 absurd or crazy or whatever.

1:00:10.840 --> 1:00:12.840
 You would have made a good secret agent.

1:00:12.840 --> 1:00:13.840
 You know exactly...

1:00:13.840 --> 1:00:15.960
 How do you know I'm not?

1:00:15.960 --> 1:00:16.960
 This is...

1:00:16.960 --> 1:00:19.160
 We'll discuss this further.

1:00:19.160 --> 1:00:21.160
 I'm dressed like one.

1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:24.040
 Actually, yeah, were there any dress code?

1:00:24.040 --> 1:00:26.200
 No, just fit in.

1:00:26.200 --> 1:00:27.200
 Fit in.

1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:28.200
 No matter what.

1:00:28.200 --> 1:00:29.200
 And then be creative.

1:00:29.200 --> 1:00:30.200
 Yeah.

1:00:30.200 --> 1:00:31.200
 Figure out ways to fit.

1:00:31.200 --> 1:00:32.200
 Right.

1:00:32.200 --> 1:00:40.000
 So anyways, he gave me some tasks and since I had rented a room in a house, he gave me

1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:54.080
 Western literature to read and we spent time together and there was a practice run to West

1:00:54.080 --> 1:00:55.080
 Germany.

1:00:55.080 --> 1:00:58.760
 Actually, there were two and that was very important.

1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:01.680
 In hindsight, I figured that out.

1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:08.200
 So I traveled to West Germany, no, not to West Berlin, with an East German passport

1:01:08.200 --> 1:01:13.840
 that was stamped that that individual was allowed to go to the West.

1:01:13.840 --> 1:01:24.240
 And there was a part of the border that was only guarded by Soviet troops and that's where

1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:26.320
 they smuggled me into West Germany.

1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:33.760
 I got on the subway and then appeared in West Berlin.

1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:38.120
 No Americans, no Brits, no French knew that I had entered.

1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:39.120
 Irish documents?

1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:41.880
 No, no, this was an East German passport.

1:01:41.880 --> 1:01:42.880
 It was real.

1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:43.880
 Okay.

1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:44.880
 Okay.

1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:52.720
 So and the first trip, all they wanted me to do is just walk around, smell the air,

1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:57.920
 have a beer or whatever and eat a sausage and then come back.

1:01:57.920 --> 1:02:04.400
 The second trip, I had a task very similar to the one that I had back in Jena to ring

1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:11.280
 the doorbell someplace and talk to some people and that worked very well also.

1:02:11.280 --> 1:02:17.560
 I should mention that you talk about that, you know, eat a sausage, drink some beer.

1:02:17.560 --> 1:02:24.260
 I suppose that's a good test too to see how you behave under Western, like when first

1:02:24.260 --> 1:02:25.880
 introduced to the Western culture.

1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:33.200
 Like this is why I might not make a good agent is when I first came to the United States

1:02:33.200 --> 1:02:40.840
 in the supermarket, like bananas, as many bananas as I want to eat.

1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:43.720
 That I think that would break me.

1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:45.400
 It's a shock.

1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:49.120
 It's a shock to have access to Western culture.

1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:57.600
 You're getting very close to the reason they actually made me do these two practice trips.

1:02:57.600 --> 1:03:04.040
 When I first emerged on West Berlin territory, I felt highly uncomfortable.

1:03:04.040 --> 1:03:06.440
 That was at the enemy, right?

1:03:06.440 --> 1:03:12.000
 And I saw the cops everywhere and even though those cops had like light blue uniforms, nothing,

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:13.600
 they weren't standouts.

1:03:13.600 --> 1:03:18.800
 So I was wondering, you know, if they knew that, you know, I had like KGB on my forehead.

1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:20.920
 So you were paranoid that they would know, they would see.

1:03:20.920 --> 1:03:24.140
 I was scared, but I overcame that.

1:03:24.140 --> 1:03:29.260
 So that's, can we just linger on that because I suppose that's a natural, like if I give

1:03:29.260 --> 1:03:35.720
 anybody on the street the mission to do the mission you had to do is they would be paranoid.

1:03:35.720 --> 1:03:39.280
 That's a natural human feeling is am I being watched?

1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:41.360
 Do they know?

1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:47.720
 Like if you try to steal something from a store, there's going to be a feeling like,

1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:48.720
 are they watching me?

1:03:48.720 --> 1:03:49.720
 Are the cameras watching?

1:03:49.720 --> 1:03:50.720
 Are the people watching me?

1:03:50.720 --> 1:03:51.720
 They all know that kind of stuff.

1:03:51.720 --> 1:03:56.720
 So you have to over, or you have to be somehow rugged and robust to that kind of feeling

1:03:56.720 --> 1:03:57.720
 and overcome it.

1:03:57.720 --> 1:03:58.800
 Yes, exactly.

1:03:58.800 --> 1:04:04.960
 So and something very interesting happened while I was being trained in Berlin, I met

1:04:04.960 --> 1:04:11.180
 a classmate of mine from high school and he confided to me that he was recruited by the

1:04:11.180 --> 1:04:16.400
 Stasi to become a spy, go as a spy to West Germany.

1:04:16.400 --> 1:04:20.760
 And he also had this practice trip and he peed in his pants.

1:04:20.760 --> 1:04:23.800
 He went back and told him, I can't do that.

1:04:23.800 --> 1:04:27.160
 Just from the terror, that paranoia.

1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:30.920
 Now this guy's career was over.

1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:39.340
 He had an engineering degree, he was a pretty smart guy, he was just for the rest of his

1:04:39.340 --> 1:04:45.720
 life and he's still alive I believe, floating around and trading in model railroads and

1:04:45.720 --> 1:04:46.720
 stuff like that.

1:04:46.720 --> 1:04:49.920
 You mean do you think that experience broke him?

1:04:49.920 --> 1:04:51.120
 They wouldn't let him back in.

1:04:51.120 --> 1:04:52.120
 Oh, I see.

1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:53.120
 They, oh.

1:04:53.120 --> 1:04:54.120
 Yeah.

1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:56.800
 So this is a test that if you fail, you pay the price.

1:04:56.800 --> 1:05:03.280
 I had no idea that, you know, something bad would happen if I failed that test, but I

1:05:03.280 --> 1:05:04.280
 didn't.

1:05:04.280 --> 1:05:05.280
 Yeah.

1:05:05.280 --> 1:05:06.280
 I didn't fail.

1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:13.280
 So, and this led then to the offer, all right, and after, you know, Boris was happy with

1:05:13.280 --> 1:05:21.040
 me and he told his boss who was most likely the head of the KGB in East Berlin and I had

1:05:21.040 --> 1:05:22.920
 an appointment to meet.

1:05:22.920 --> 1:05:23.920
 In East Germany.

1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:24.920
 Yes.

1:05:24.920 --> 1:05:25.920
 In East Germany.

1:05:25.920 --> 1:05:26.920
 Yeah.

1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:27.920
 All of East Germany.

1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:28.920
 Yes.

1:05:28.920 --> 1:05:29.920
 That's right.

1:05:29.920 --> 1:05:35.280
 An appointment to meet with him and as we walk into the room, there was this huge desk

1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:45.960
 and a little guy sitting behind it, very, very, just like little and unimpressive, right?

1:05:45.960 --> 1:05:53.640
 A lot of paraphernalia, like, you know, had a bust of Dzerzhinsky on his desk and some

1:05:53.640 --> 1:06:03.560
 paintings of Lenin and so forth, but when the guy opened his mouth, he went like, whoa.

1:06:03.560 --> 1:06:06.280
 Huge psychological energy.

1:06:06.280 --> 1:06:12.400
 He spoke only Russian now and initially, he would, you know, start the bet with five minutes

1:06:12.400 --> 1:06:17.040
 worth of propaganda, why we're doing what we're doing, I didn't need that, I understood

1:06:17.040 --> 1:06:25.240
 most of it, but when I didn't understand, I'd ask Boris to translate and then he sprung

1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:27.080
 it on me and I was not prepared.

1:06:27.080 --> 1:06:30.840
 He said, so what, are you in or not?

1:06:30.840 --> 1:06:34.720
 And I was, no, I hadn't made up my mind.

1:06:34.720 --> 1:06:43.280
 I wasn't expecting that would come and so I said to him, I'm not really trained, you

1:06:43.280 --> 1:06:46.840
 know, there's a lot of things I need to learn and I came up with a couple of really stupid

1:06:46.840 --> 1:06:51.720
 things, one not so stupid, but the other one was, I don't know why I said that, I said,

1:06:51.720 --> 1:06:58.400
 for instance, I need to learn how to drive a car and to type with a typewriter and he

1:06:58.400 --> 1:07:03.200
 got really annoyed and he said, don't worry about it, we'll train you.

1:07:03.200 --> 1:07:06.480
 But I got to tell you, we need people who are decisive.

1:07:06.480 --> 1:07:12.840
 So you got until tomorrow noon to give Boris your decision.

1:07:12.840 --> 1:07:15.480
 That made for a sleepless night.

1:07:15.480 --> 1:07:17.320
 So what was going through your mind?

1:07:17.320 --> 1:07:26.160
 Well I had, this was almost 50, 50, I knew I was going to have a huge career, a good

1:07:26.160 --> 1:07:27.160
 career.

1:07:27.160 --> 1:07:35.240
 It was on my way because I was already employed by the university as an assistant professor.

1:07:35.240 --> 1:07:40.760
 So that career would be to become a professor, become a 10 year professor, be a world class.

1:07:40.760 --> 1:07:41.760
 Yes.

1:07:41.760 --> 1:07:43.560
 Jena had become my hometown.

1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:45.400
 I really loved the place.

1:07:45.400 --> 1:07:54.520
 It was my oyster and my family was my basketball team.

1:07:54.520 --> 1:07:55.520
 You love playing basketball.

1:07:55.520 --> 1:07:56.520
 Oh absolutely.

1:07:56.520 --> 1:07:57.520
 Yeah.

1:07:57.520 --> 1:07:58.520
 So this is home.

1:07:58.520 --> 1:07:59.520
 This is home.

1:07:59.520 --> 1:08:00.520
 This is where your love is.

1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:01.520
 This was home.

1:08:01.520 --> 1:08:05.240
 Did you understand that the choice involved leaving the home behind?

1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:06.240
 Yes.

1:08:06.240 --> 1:08:11.900
 And the one thing I didn't have, the two things I didn't have, an emotional relationship

1:08:11.900 --> 1:08:16.920
 with my mother and I didn't have a steady girlfriend at the time.

1:08:16.920 --> 1:08:20.120
 I think Freud would have a lot to say about that, but yeah, go ahead.

1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:24.360
 But the connection between those two, but yeah, I'm sure.

1:08:24.360 --> 1:08:29.360
 By the way, my friend Günther, the one who worked for the Stasi, was also, the Stasi

1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:36.240
 tried to recruit him as an agent, but he had a love relationship at the time and he said

1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:37.800
 politely, no, I won't.

1:08:37.800 --> 1:08:38.800
 I can't.

1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:44.520
 So you didn't have, that's the one thing that really could have held you to this place

1:08:44.520 --> 1:08:45.520
 is love.

1:08:45.520 --> 1:08:49.800
 So you got the career on the one hand, my basketball team, the town that I would be

1:08:49.800 --> 1:08:57.520
 part of the ruling elite of, and then we had this great adventure and the ability to contribute

1:08:57.520 --> 1:09:04.660
 to the victory, the worldwide victory of communism and stick it to the Nazis and of course the

1:09:04.660 --> 1:09:07.120
 feeling that you're really special.

1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:08.120
 Yeah.

1:09:08.120 --> 1:09:09.120
 James Bond.

1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:10.120
 Yeah.

1:09:10.120 --> 1:09:15.240
 What's, the question, do I want to be a tenured professor or James Bond?

1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:16.240
 Yes.

1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:19.240
 And as funny as that sounds, that was probably a difficult decision.

1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:27.320
 It was a difficult decision, but fundamentally it wasn't, and it wasn't my zeal to help the

1:09:27.320 --> 1:09:28.320
 revolution.

1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:37.320
 It was my, what they called, what the Stasi was looking for, the KGB was looking for in

1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:42.480
 a character that they would send over a well controlled inclination to adventure.

1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:43.480
 Okay.

1:09:43.480 --> 1:09:44.480
 Yeah.

1:09:44.480 --> 1:09:45.480
 Yeah.

1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:46.480
 James Bond.

1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:49.120
 What do you say?

1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:50.120
 In the love of women.

1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:51.120
 Yeah.

1:09:51.120 --> 1:09:58.640
 I was, yes, I got to put this in right here because I'm telling people I have two things

1:09:58.640 --> 1:10:01.000
 in common with James Bond.

1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:07.560
 These are my initials, JB, and I got the girl too, three times.

1:10:07.560 --> 1:10:08.560
 Yeah.

1:10:08.560 --> 1:10:11.360
 I mean that's, and that's adventure.

1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:12.360
 Yeah.

1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:18.600
 And the ability to travel to the West because the West was closed off to us, we could go

1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:21.920
 to foreign countries, but they all had to be communist countries.

1:10:21.920 --> 1:10:29.800
 You know, I wanted to see Paris because I had fallen in love with the Honore Balzac

1:10:29.800 --> 1:10:35.340
 who wrote a phenomenal set of novels that I just ate up.

1:10:35.340 --> 1:10:40.080
 And so when I eventually did go to Paris, I knew all the places already because he described

1:10:40.080 --> 1:10:41.080
 them all.

1:10:41.080 --> 1:10:49.160
 Okay, so that one, it was a, it was 5149, but eventually it, and you know, when you,

1:10:49.160 --> 1:10:55.920
 when you do the side by side intellectual comparison, that doesn't work.

1:10:55.920 --> 1:10:56.920
 It becomes a tie.

1:10:56.920 --> 1:11:00.120
 And then, you know, you just go with your gut and I said, Hey, I'm in.

1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:06.000
 So now that you successfully passed the test and you were sitting with this unimpressive

1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:13.920
 man and had the invite and had to sleep on it and have made the decision to join.

1:11:13.920 --> 1:11:14.920
 Yeah.

1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:15.920
 What was next?

1:11:15.920 --> 1:11:20.160
 I was just told, you know, that I was being recruited by the state department of East

1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:21.160
 Germany.

1:11:21.160 --> 1:11:24.600
 I was going to become a diplomat.

1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:30.480
 I must have had some paper, but I forgot because just by saying so, then that would, that wouldn't

1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:31.480
 have worked.

1:11:31.480 --> 1:11:35.000
 There's some kind of document that says that, and that was the only entanglement you had

1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.040
 to that, to that place.

1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:38.040
 No love.

1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:43.040
 No basketball, basketball, giving up basketball was huge for me.

1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:44.920
 I love playing that game.

1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:48.440
 I started playing basketball when I was 18.

1:11:48.440 --> 1:11:49.440
 That's a little late.

1:11:49.440 --> 1:11:51.440
 Are you better offensive, defensive?

1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:52.440
 What do you like more?

1:11:52.440 --> 1:11:54.000
 Do you like to shoot from a distance?

1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:56.360
 Do you like, I was a runner.

1:11:56.360 --> 1:12:01.720
 I was very, very quick on my feet and I was a good jumper too.

1:12:01.720 --> 1:12:09.040
 I typically played the, uh, the, the four position, you know, what's that, uh, forward

1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:11.080
 or the forward position, forward position.

1:12:11.080 --> 1:12:16.320
 But anyway, um, so that, that, that was the hardest, uh, uh, for me to give up.

1:12:16.320 --> 1:12:22.120
 Um, but indeed the other thing that I remember I had to do to hand in my party document to

1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:25.520
 the party secretary of the university.

1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:27.480
 And uh, he made a comment.

1:12:27.480 --> 1:12:28.480
 Yeah.

1:12:28.480 --> 1:12:32.120
 We probably won't hear much about you, but, uh, we know that you're going to do something

1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:33.360
 very important.

1:12:33.360 --> 1:12:39.420
 So he sort of had an inkling that, uh, I'm going, I'm going to go someplace, uh, undercover

1:12:39.420 --> 1:12:40.960
 or something like that.

1:12:40.960 --> 1:12:47.960
 And then I packed my bags and got on a train, uh, to Berlin for another one of those secret

1:12:47.960 --> 1:12:53.640
 meetings with, uh, my, my new handler, Nikolai.

1:12:53.640 --> 1:13:01.400
 So and here, here came another test that, that would have been quite easy to fail.

1:13:01.400 --> 1:13:09.720
 So I, I had lived, uh, in Yena for six years in a dorm, even when I became a, an employee

1:13:09.720 --> 1:13:12.800
 of the university, they didn't, they didn't have apartments.

1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:17.080
 I was still living in a dorm and, and they won in a single room with a bed, a chair and

1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:21.480
 a table and a toilet down the, down the hallway.

1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:26.980
 So I figured, you know, Berlin KGB, I'm going to get a nice apartment, right?

1:13:26.980 --> 1:13:31.700
 And so, uh, uh, Nikolai took me into his car.

1:13:31.700 --> 1:13:35.900
 We started talking a little bit and then he said, I have a task for you already.

1:13:35.900 --> 1:13:40.200
 Your first task is to find yourself a place to live.

1:13:40.200 --> 1:13:46.000
 I mean, I don't think I showed it in my face, but you know, my heart, my, my, my, my heart

1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.640
 dropped like down to into my pants.

1:13:48.640 --> 1:13:54.920
 I, I knew this was nearly impossible because it was a severe shortage of, uh, of housing

1:13:54.920 --> 1:14:01.200
 and in, in, in everywhere in Germany, East Germany and all the apartments and homes were

1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:03.940
 controlled by, by the government.

1:14:03.940 --> 1:14:05.920
 You know, there were long waiting lists.

1:14:05.920 --> 1:14:12.340
 Uh, I know, I knew couples that, uh, were promised maybe to get an apartment, uh, five

1:14:12.340 --> 1:14:13.900
 years down the road.

1:14:13.900 --> 1:14:18.200
 So then they would postpone the decision to have a child.

1:14:18.200 --> 1:14:20.120
 Anyway, this was impossible.

1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:26.720
 Uh, well, yeah, but this was a test, you know, because I had to be inventive.

1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:30.680
 Now I had to figure out, uh, how to get out of an impossible situation.

1:14:30.680 --> 1:14:33.520
 I didn't realize it then at all.

1:14:33.520 --> 1:14:37.280
 I just went with the flow, you know, what do I do?

1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:47.120
 So what I did, I went, I took the train, the city train, uh, to the very last stop, a little

1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:49.480
 town called Ackner.

1:14:49.480 --> 1:14:54.740
 And I wandered around in that town and knocked on doors and asked people if they knew where

1:14:54.740 --> 1:14:56.980
 somebody might have a place to live.

1:14:56.980 --> 1:15:00.600
 And after a couple of hours, somebody said, there's this lady that, and she gave, and

1:15:00.600 --> 1:15:05.820
 they gave me the address and I talked to the lady and she said, I happen to have a place

1:15:05.820 --> 1:15:08.880
 that you might, uh, that where you might be able to stay.

1:15:08.880 --> 1:15:10.120
 It was an outbuilding.

1:15:10.120 --> 1:15:13.920
 Uh, I don't know what it was, what it served.

1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:14.920
 It was not a garage.

1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:16.680
 It was concrete.

1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:25.940
 And it had, um, a bed and a chair, uh, running cold water and a stove, a cold stove.

1:15:25.940 --> 1:15:28.120
 That was my, was going to be my...

1:15:28.120 --> 1:15:29.120
 Pretty basic.

1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:30.120
 Pretty basic.

1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:31.120
 That's your...

1:15:31.120 --> 1:15:32.120
 Pretty basic?

1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:33.120
 Are you kidding me?

1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:34.120
 That's the, uh...

1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:35.120
 Toilet across the yard, of course.

1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:36.120
 Yeah.

1:15:36.120 --> 1:15:37.120
 Well, all the essentials.

1:15:37.120 --> 1:15:38.120
 What are you complaining about?

1:15:38.120 --> 1:15:45.320
 So you were, you had to run the, uh, the special, James Bond had to run a special operation

1:15:45.320 --> 1:15:46.320
 out of the house.

1:15:46.320 --> 1:15:54.040
 To, to, to my credit, and I think that, that, uh, that established part of my reputation.

1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:56.960
 I didn't complain at all to Nikolai.

1:15:56.960 --> 1:15:58.560
 That was part of the test probably.

1:15:58.560 --> 1:15:59.560
 Yeah.

1:15:59.560 --> 1:16:01.200
 I just told him, you know, I found something.

1:16:01.200 --> 1:16:08.040
 And so, uh, for six months I would get up in the morning, get on the train and walk

1:16:08.040 --> 1:16:13.920
 around in the city, you know, uh, did some operational stuff, uh, operational training.

1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:18.320
 I went to the library, did a lot of reading in the library.

1:16:18.320 --> 1:16:20.680
 And then I found a basketball team that I could join.

1:16:20.680 --> 1:16:24.040
 So at least I could take a shower twice a week.

1:16:24.040 --> 1:16:34.160
 Um, and, uh, and apparently it took about six months that I was still on probation because

1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:40.600
 after six months, Nikolai, one day we were still meeting in his car, he said, he handed

1:16:40.600 --> 1:16:46.680
 me a key and he said, I'm going to take you to your new apartment.

1:16:46.680 --> 1:16:50.560
 Now I, and I didn't know this, you know, that now I was really in.

1:16:50.560 --> 1:16:51.560
 Okay.

1:16:51.560 --> 1:16:57.000
 Imagine the hurdles you have to jump over and how many times you can fail, but you know.

1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:00.240
 But not complaining, not asking questions.

1:17:00.240 --> 1:17:01.240
 Yes.

1:17:01.240 --> 1:17:03.320
 I mean, that was something you've written about.

1:17:03.320 --> 1:17:07.880
 Um, I think you wrote that bosses do not like to hear complaints or problems.

1:17:07.880 --> 1:17:08.880
 They prefer solutions.

1:17:08.880 --> 1:17:09.880
 That's right.

1:17:09.880 --> 1:17:12.400
 So what was your interaction like with the bosses?

1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:19.800
 Is that essentially, um, represents the way he went forward as well?

1:17:19.800 --> 1:17:25.560
 I, no complaints, no arguments, no, no, I know this better.

1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:30.400
 I was taking it all in now that the, the, the technical guys, you know, they taught

1:17:30.400 --> 1:17:32.640
 me something I didn't know that made sense.

1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:40.280
 Um, what Nikolai, some of the stuff that he taught me was somewhat questionable.

1:17:40.280 --> 1:17:44.800
 He was a generalist and there's some things he didn't know really well.

1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:48.840
 So I could have like asked, probed a little bit, but I didn't.

1:17:48.840 --> 1:17:50.920
 So I just played along.

1:17:50.920 --> 1:17:57.480
 So this new apartment was, uh, uh, it was a studio at, at, at, at a kitchen with running

1:17:57.480 --> 1:18:04.480
 cold water and the bathroom was just one flight down the toilet, not a bathroom, uh, one flight

1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:09.320
 down the stairs, uh, it was a big upgrade.

1:18:09.320 --> 1:18:14.640
 And he gave me, uh, I think he gave me a thousand mark to buy, buy furniture.

1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:20.000
 And in that place, I actually, I also bought a TV and started watching West German television.

1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:25.120
 So I finally had a decent place to stay.

1:18:25.120 --> 1:18:30.760
 Um, and the, the, my training in Berlin took about two years.

1:18:30.760 --> 1:18:31.760
 What was the training?

1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:35.840
 What were the interesting aspects to the training?

1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:39.960
 What were sort of, if you do an overview systematic of what was the training process, what was

1:18:39.960 --> 1:18:45.320
 difficult, what are some insights that generalize to the training process of what it takes to

1:18:45.320 --> 1:18:47.400
 be a KGB spy?

1:18:47.400 --> 1:18:48.400
 Right.

1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:51.840
 So, uh, let me start with the trade craft.

1:18:51.840 --> 1:18:59.280
 So I was taught Morse code that took a while, uh, I, I, I was, uh, instructed in how to,

1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:06.740
 you know, use a shortwave radio and to receive, uh, the, the shortwave, uh, transmissions

1:19:06.740 --> 1:19:08.880
 with Morse code.

1:19:08.880 --> 1:19:17.820
 I was taught, uh, uh, and a encryption and decryption algorithm, manual algorithm, you,

1:19:17.820 --> 1:19:22.760
 you might be interested that eventually I figured out, uh, at least one of the patterns,

1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:30.720
 uh, the, the algorithm was such that the, and this was all about digits, like, uh, and

1:19:30.720 --> 1:19:37.440
 the algorithm was such that in the end, the, uh, the digits that were used to decipher

1:19:37.440 --> 1:19:43.080
 other digits that were handed, uh, that were sent to me by a shortwave radio, there were,

1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:48.080
 let's say if there were a hundred digits, there were an equal number of ones, twos,

1:19:48.080 --> 1:19:52.840
 threes, fours, fives, six, and seven, and up until zero.

1:19:52.840 --> 1:19:58.740
 And I was told that, uh, these, um, uh, algorithms, these manual algorithms were, were good for

1:19:58.740 --> 1:20:00.280
 about 300 uses.

1:20:00.280 --> 1:20:03.080
 After that, they could still be deciphered.

1:20:03.080 --> 1:20:06.680
 I'm assuming nowadays that, uh, wouldn't take as much.

1:20:06.680 --> 1:20:07.680
 Yeah.

1:20:07.680 --> 1:20:09.040
 With, with computers for sure.

1:20:09.040 --> 1:20:15.880
 But there's probably, they're probably designed in a way that you can manually sort of, uh,

1:20:15.880 --> 1:20:22.240
 it's efficient and convenient to use them manually, it's not to optimize cryptographic

1:20:22.240 --> 1:20:27.120
 security, it's to optimize, it's like to balance security and like humans being able to actually.

1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:28.120
 Yeah.

1:20:28.120 --> 1:20:29.120
 No, I got to disagree.

1:20:29.120 --> 1:20:30.600
 It was neither efficient nor convenient.

1:20:30.600 --> 1:20:31.600
 Okay.

1:20:31.600 --> 1:20:32.600
 It took a long time.

1:20:32.600 --> 1:20:33.600
 So it wasn't decipherable.

1:20:33.600 --> 1:20:39.680
 When, what was, what was significantly easier to do, uh, but, uh, that would require you

1:20:39.680 --> 1:20:42.000
 to have spied paraphernalia with you.

1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:44.680
 This is what's called a one time pad.

1:20:44.680 --> 1:20:51.240
 So you have the set of numbers on, on a sheet of paper, uh, that had to be developed.

1:20:51.240 --> 1:20:55.280
 I had to use iodine to make those numbers visible.

1:20:55.280 --> 1:21:01.840
 Those are known to be unbreakable unless they are used multiple times, the same, the same

1:21:01.840 --> 1:21:06.320
 sheet of paper, because, you know, the person who encrypts has the same set of numbers as

1:21:06.320 --> 1:21:14.000
 the person who decrypts and one, one time use, you cannot figure out what the message

1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:15.000
 is.

1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:16.000
 Oh, interesting.

1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:20.240
 But this is a quick way to communicate from one person to another one time, one time.

1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:24.280
 One time, but I had a pad with multiple, uh, sheets of paper, right?

1:21:24.280 --> 1:21:31.760
 And, uh, the reason that they gave me a manual one is because I literally, I had only when

1:21:31.760 --> 1:21:38.560
 I, when I wound up in the United States, I had only one thing with me that, uh, only

1:21:38.560 --> 1:21:39.560
 a spy can have.

1:21:39.560 --> 1:21:46.200
 And that was a, uh, a writing pad with, uh, uh, where the first 10 pages or so were impregnated

1:21:46.200 --> 1:21:49.760
 with a trace of a chemical that was used for secret writing.

1:21:49.760 --> 1:21:53.480
 Uh, but you really would have to know what you're looking for to, you know, you see this

1:21:53.480 --> 1:21:56.320
 pad it was bought at, uh, you know, Walmart and.

1:21:56.320 --> 1:21:58.520
 Can you explain a little, a little further?

1:21:58.520 --> 1:22:01.640
 What is the chemical here that, what are we talking about?

1:22:01.640 --> 1:22:07.120
 So how, I don't understand how it's possible to have a physical pad that does the encryption

1:22:07.120 --> 1:22:09.920
 without any computing.

1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:10.920
 How does it encode?

1:22:10.920 --> 1:22:11.920
 All right.

1:22:11.920 --> 1:22:18.100
 So, so no, no, it doesn't, it doesn't do any work, you know, so, and the, uh, the communication

1:22:18.100 --> 1:22:26.020
 that the encrypted communication was, uh, was, uh, a set of, uh, uh, groups of five,

1:22:26.020 --> 1:22:32.660
 five digits and then another five and there's always a gap in between, um, and, uh, so let's

1:22:32.660 --> 1:22:38.240
 say if I get this radio transmission, I write them all down and then I, then I use my, uh,

1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:42.840
 develop my algorithm and then I do mathematics, either addition or subtraction.

1:22:42.840 --> 1:22:48.840
 The resulting set of digits had then had a one to one correlation to letters.

1:22:48.840 --> 1:22:51.080
 And this is an easy way to then do the correlation.

1:22:51.080 --> 1:22:52.080
 Yes.

1:22:52.080 --> 1:22:53.080
 Yes.

1:22:53.080 --> 1:22:54.080
 Well, that's cool.

1:22:54.080 --> 1:22:56.400
 So you're saying the algorithm was not efficient.

1:22:56.400 --> 1:22:57.400
 It was not.

1:22:57.400 --> 1:23:02.120
 Oh, the manual took a long time and, and you can't make an error.

1:23:02.120 --> 1:23:03.120
 Right.

1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:06.680
 Uh, would you know where, can you, is it easy to debug?

1:23:06.680 --> 1:23:09.040
 No, no, you do it twice.

1:23:09.040 --> 1:23:10.520
 You do it twice and that's how you check.

1:23:10.520 --> 1:23:15.540
 If it's identical, then you know, but like, if it's not, then one is right and the other

1:23:15.540 --> 1:23:16.540
 is wrong.

1:23:16.540 --> 1:23:17.540
 You gotta do it again.

1:23:17.540 --> 1:23:18.540
 Don't make mistakes.

1:23:18.540 --> 1:23:19.540
 No, that's right.

1:23:19.540 --> 1:23:20.540
 And I really didn't.

1:23:20.540 --> 1:23:30.680
 So I was, I was learning that, uh, I was also, uh, told that I was required to become proficient

1:23:30.680 --> 1:23:36.120
 in another language and they gave me a choice and I picked English.

1:23:36.120 --> 1:23:37.120
 That's what was the other one.

1:23:37.120 --> 1:23:41.240
 Oh no, pick one friend, you know, whatever is spoken in the West.

1:23:41.240 --> 1:23:42.240
 Got it.

1:23:42.240 --> 1:23:44.400
 Uh, what was, what was, what would be second to you?

1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:46.760
 Would you, would you think French because of Paris?

1:23:46.760 --> 1:23:49.580
 What would you, what, why English?

1:23:49.580 --> 1:23:54.880
 English was a no brainer because I, I was a straight age to a student in English without

1:23:54.880 --> 1:23:55.880
 studying.

1:23:55.880 --> 1:23:58.200
 I like it came so easily to me.

1:23:58.200 --> 1:24:02.200
 So that's why I chose it, right?

1:24:02.200 --> 1:24:09.640
 So that was that, uh, then, uh, um, I, uh, I w I was taught the basics of, um, uh, counter

1:24:09.640 --> 1:24:15.880
 surveillance, you know, some trickery and, and, and, uh, um, uh, surveillance detection

1:24:15.880 --> 1:24:24.000
 routes where you wander around in the city for three hours and determine whether you're

1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:26.160
 being followed or not.

1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:29.280
 That requires you to plan the route very well.

1:24:29.280 --> 1:24:35.280
 I give you one example that, uh, that will illustrate that as my, my favorite spot.

1:24:35.280 --> 1:24:39.880
 When, when, when I was in Moscow, I did a lot of that also.

1:24:39.880 --> 1:24:47.800
 And if my favorite spot was, I wasn't a not well traveled, uh, uh, road.

1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:50.720
 It went down the hill and, and curved.

1:24:50.720 --> 1:24:55.080
 And at the bottom of the hill, there was a telephone booth.

1:24:55.080 --> 1:25:00.640
 And when you open the door and pick up the telephone, you have to look back.

1:25:00.640 --> 1:25:01.960
 So it wasn't like this, right?

1:25:01.960 --> 1:25:02.960
 It wasn't a giveaway.

1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:03.960
 This was normal.

1:25:03.960 --> 1:25:04.960
 That was natural.

1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:09.840
 So I could see if somebody would come walking after me, you know, these kinds of things.

1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:19.480
 Or you would, uh, uh, you know, use, um, public transportation, uh, big buildings, uh, where

1:25:19.480 --> 1:25:26.480
 you needed to use an elevator and see who's because surveillance, the, the object of

1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:31.160
 surveillance is to never lose sight of the individual who you're surveilling because

1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:36.980
 at that point you may miss the window where he does something that you're looking for.

1:25:36.980 --> 1:25:40.600
 So somebody always has to come close, right?

1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:44.040
 Did you have to also study surveillance?

1:25:44.040 --> 1:25:47.680
 No, only counter surveillance.

1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:54.560
 And what helped me in, in, in all my training, uh, you know, I, I would be, uh, would have

1:25:54.560 --> 1:26:00.720
 a competition with, uh, uh, folks that were coming, they were following me and me.

1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:05.760
 And I beat them every time, uh, they were at a disadvantage because one of them always

1:26:05.760 --> 1:26:11.720
 had to be close and, and if you saw the same face twice, you know that you were being followed.

1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:15.540
 And I had a very, very good, uh, memory for, for faces.

1:26:15.540 --> 1:26:23.640
 So basically figure out a fixed route and then a fixed route that allows you to, uh,

1:26:23.640 --> 1:26:28.960
 survey the area and then record the faces you've seen inside your mind.

1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:33.200
 And if, uh, you see multiple times a single face, that's, that's a bad sign.

1:26:33.200 --> 1:26:38.880
 And then they could, they could, uh, you use, uh, different clothes, uh, but they didn't

1:26:38.880 --> 1:26:41.760
 have was face masks.

1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:44.280
 The CIA does nowadays.

1:26:44.280 --> 1:26:47.000
 They can give you a different face within seconds.

1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:48.000
 Yeah.

1:26:48.000 --> 1:27:00.880
 So how big, I mean, again, you talk about paranoia, um, is that part of the, is that

1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:06.840
 a big part of the job, uh, counter surveillance, like being constantly paranoid that you're

1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:07.840
 being watched?

1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:08.840
 Yeah.

1:27:08.840 --> 1:27:09.840
 I was supposed to.

1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:10.840
 Isn't that quite stressful.

1:27:10.840 --> 1:27:14.240
 So is that, is that one of the, is that actually an effective way to operate?

1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:16.560
 Uh, nobody, it sort of becomes a routine.

1:27:16.560 --> 1:27:23.040
 Uh, I was told to do it, uh, while in the U S once a month and, uh, okay.

1:27:23.040 --> 1:27:24.040
 It's like a cleaning out.

1:27:24.040 --> 1:27:25.040
 Oh, not, not every day.

1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:26.640
 No, no, no, no, no.

1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:31.000
 Once a month or before I would say, mail a letter with secret writing.

1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:38.640
 So I was sure that, you know, nobody saw me put an envelope into a postbox.

1:27:38.640 --> 1:27:41.560
 So this is one of the tools in your toolbox is Morse code.

1:27:41.560 --> 1:27:43.820
 There's the decryption and encryption.

1:27:43.820 --> 1:27:50.880
 There's the car surveillance, photography, um, making, making microdots, you know, what

1:27:50.880 --> 1:27:51.880
 a microdot is?

1:27:51.880 --> 1:27:52.880
 What's a microdot?

1:27:52.880 --> 1:28:03.880
 It's, uh, you use, you, you take a photograph and you use a microscope in reverse and, uh,

1:28:03.880 --> 1:28:12.840
 make that photograph really small, so small that it's like the head of a pin that can

1:28:12.840 --> 1:28:17.400
 be used to, uh, hide under a postage stamp.

1:28:17.400 --> 1:28:24.200
 Uh, in reality, I knew how to make them, but in reality, they, they never asked me to make

1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:25.200
 use of that technique.

1:28:25.200 --> 1:28:29.400
 So it's a, it's a sort of an encryption mechanism for photographs.

1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:30.400
 Yeah.

1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:35.920
 So what we do nowadays, embed, uh, code in, in, uh, PDFs and stuff like that.

1:28:35.920 --> 1:28:36.920
 Right?

1:28:36.920 --> 1:28:37.920
 Yeah.

1:28:37.920 --> 1:28:38.920
 Beautiful.

1:28:38.920 --> 1:28:39.920
 Okay.

1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:40.920
 All right.

1:28:40.920 --> 1:28:43.000
 So that, that was a learning, a training process, both in the physical space and sort

1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:46.080
 of, um, algorithmically.

1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:47.080
 Is there other things?

1:28:47.080 --> 1:28:48.080
 Yeah.

1:28:48.080 --> 1:28:49.080
 You bet.

1:28:49.080 --> 1:28:55.320
 Uh, interestingly enough, the, uh, I was, um, the first book I was given to read was

1:28:55.320 --> 1:28:59.840
 the history of this, uh, these, uh, communist party of the Soviet union.

1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:02.360
 Oh, so understand.

1:29:02.360 --> 1:29:03.360
 That's interesting.

1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:04.640
 Cause you said you had to read Western literature.

1:29:04.640 --> 1:29:05.640
 Yeah, that too.

1:29:05.640 --> 1:29:11.680
 How much, how much reading, so history, how much history of politics, geopolitics, culture.

1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:15.680
 Not much more, but they made me read that document.

1:29:15.680 --> 1:29:19.080
 Other than that, I wasn't supposed to study the Soviet union.

1:29:19.080 --> 1:29:23.480
 I wasn't supposed and that was not, and I didn't, when they sent me to Moscow, it wasn't

1:29:23.480 --> 1:29:25.040
 to learn Russia, Russian, right?

1:29:25.040 --> 1:29:26.920
 It was to learn English.

1:29:26.920 --> 1:29:32.720
 Um, the, the second document they gave me was the, the constitution of West Germany.

1:29:32.720 --> 1:29:35.240
 And then I got lots of magazines and stuff like that.

1:29:35.240 --> 1:29:42.080
 Uh, as I told you, I was, uh, also told to, uh, uh, watch West German television, which

1:29:42.080 --> 1:29:49.760
 I, which I, uh, embraced with a vengeance because it was better than East German.

1:29:49.760 --> 1:29:54.320
 So I would get up in the morning and have a little breakfast and watch the German version

1:29:54.320 --> 1:29:56.320
 of Sesame street.

1:29:56.320 --> 1:30:01.960
 And that, that, that helps you, uh, that helps you get an understanding of the culture.

1:30:01.960 --> 1:30:08.960
 You have to do any kind of, uh, interaction, kind of spying that you have to be, be able

1:30:08.960 --> 1:30:09.960
 to effectively integrate.

1:30:09.960 --> 1:30:15.320
 Well, you, you also have to know, like, and, and that would have been easier, uh, if I,

1:30:15.320 --> 1:30:18.920
 they had sent me to West Germany, you know, all the soccer teams, you know, stuff that

1:30:18.920 --> 1:30:23.400
 everybody knows when I came to the U S I knew very little stuff that everybody knows.

1:30:23.400 --> 1:30:28.600
 That's why I had to be very cautious and, you know, take it in all the time anyway.

1:30:28.600 --> 1:30:34.360
 Uh, and the, the last thing I want to mention is, uh, they, uh, I was strongly encouraged

1:30:34.360 --> 1:30:40.500
 to, uh, expand my, my cultural education.

1:30:40.500 --> 1:30:48.680
 In other words, go to visit museums, uh, go to the theater, uh, not so much movies, uh,

1:30:48.680 --> 1:30:53.400
 opera, read, read books from all kinds of authors.

1:30:53.400 --> 1:30:55.120
 Uh, that was important to them.

1:30:55.120 --> 1:31:00.240
 And once a month I had to write a report what I did, but the interesting thing, there was

1:31:00.240 --> 1:31:05.400
 not a, there was no curriculum, there was no agenda, there were no check marks.

1:31:05.400 --> 1:31:06.400
 It was all ad hoc.

1:31:06.400 --> 1:31:08.960
 You know, now you do this and then you do that.

1:31:08.960 --> 1:31:14.920
 Uh, and, uh, and a lot of this also, they relied on my initiative.

1:31:14.920 --> 1:31:15.920
 Again,

1:31:15.920 --> 1:31:17.920
 I mean, that's part of the evaluation too.

1:31:17.920 --> 1:31:18.920
 You bet.

1:31:18.920 --> 1:31:23.440
 Um, are you able to have creative, it's interesting that they're like developing a James Bond

1:31:23.440 --> 1:31:28.680
 type of character here, which is what, what's the reason to go to the opera as you become

1:31:28.680 --> 1:31:29.680
 Yes.

1:31:29.680 --> 1:31:35.440
 In a certain kind of way where perhaps that makes you, uh, more charming, more charismatic

1:31:35.440 --> 1:31:38.440
 in terms of your ability to integrate yourself in different situations.

1:31:38.440 --> 1:31:39.440
 You absolutely right.

1:31:39.440 --> 1:31:49.800
 Uh, uh, I, I was, I was, um, uh, uh, when I came to the US after about, uh, two years

1:31:49.800 --> 1:31:59.920
 roughly, um, I was cultured enough to, uh, not, uh, make a bad impression at a, at a

1:31:59.920 --> 1:32:02.320
 diplomatic soiree in Washington, DC.

1:32:02.320 --> 1:32:03.800
 I mingled freely.

1:32:03.800 --> 1:32:04.800
 Yes.

1:32:04.800 --> 1:32:05.800
 All right.

1:32:05.800 --> 1:32:11.320
 And, and, and so the whole idea was for me to sort of reach into the upper, uh, realms

1:32:11.320 --> 1:32:19.640
 of society where the targets would be juicier than, you know, the worker bees.

1:32:19.640 --> 1:32:21.880
 And how did you end up in Moscow?

1:32:21.880 --> 1:32:22.880
 Why?

1:32:22.880 --> 1:32:23.880
 Yeah.

1:32:23.880 --> 1:32:24.880
 What is that journey?

1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:30.720
 Well, so I, uh, I told you, and I started studying English, so I started back from scratch,

1:32:30.720 --> 1:32:37.400
 you know, they paid for a tutor and I went from like English 101 and then I went through

1:32:37.400 --> 1:32:39.140
 that in a couple of months then.

1:32:39.140 --> 1:32:43.180
 And then I got another guy with whom we, I expanded this.

1:32:43.180 --> 1:32:48.640
 We had conversations rather than working from a textbook and I, and I worked like a maniac.

1:32:48.640 --> 1:32:54.600
 I threw myself into the study of, of, of, uh, uh, English.

1:32:54.600 --> 1:32:55.600
 Like you wouldn't believe.

1:32:55.600 --> 1:33:00.240
 Um, and, and my inspiration came from Vladimir Lenin.

1:33:00.240 --> 1:33:07.240
 I had read somewhere in a book that when Lenin was in exile, he studied German and he learned

1:33:07.240 --> 1:33:11.400
 100 German words every day, new German words.

1:33:11.400 --> 1:33:15.800
 So I started reading newspapers and every word that I didn't know, I wrote down on an

1:33:15.800 --> 1:33:21.140
 index card, uh, German, English, and, uh, and I piled them up.

1:33:21.140 --> 1:33:25.360
 And so I really learned 100 new English words every day.

1:33:25.360 --> 1:33:30.400
 I know this because I counted them and I had a system how to do this.

1:33:30.400 --> 1:33:35.560
 Uh, uh, so you take your index card and you have five categories is a really good way

1:33:35.560 --> 1:33:38.120
 to learn wrote by wrote.

1:33:38.120 --> 1:33:43.340
 Uh, so you've got category one, that's the new ones and you've got category five.

1:33:43.340 --> 1:33:50.400
 So you start with, uh, with five, five, you already had right four times.

1:33:50.400 --> 1:33:53.960
 If you have it right again, it goes to the archive.

1:33:53.960 --> 1:33:57.240
 Oh, in like longterm cold archive.

1:33:57.240 --> 1:33:58.240
 Yeah.

1:33:58.240 --> 1:33:59.240
 Four.

1:33:59.240 --> 1:34:01.720
 If you get it right, it goes to five.

1:34:01.720 --> 1:34:05.440
 If you get it wrong, it gets relegated to three or so.

1:34:05.440 --> 1:34:13.000
 And so you go through this and, uh, um, and occasionally I would throw the archive things

1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:15.240
 back into one.

1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:20.120
 So I really, I really acquired a phenomenal vocabulary.

1:34:20.120 --> 1:34:23.780
 When I was done with my English, my vocabulary was significantly higher than the average

1:34:23.780 --> 1:34:29.840
 American because I, I, I didn't discriminate whatever word I didn't know I learned, which

1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:35.280
 is not necessarily the best way because you know, English has a lot of synonyms, right?

1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:36.280
 Yeah.

1:34:36.280 --> 1:34:43.800
 And one synonym is usually the, the preferable one and, and I, um, when I first interacted

1:34:43.800 --> 1:34:48.380
 with people, I very often used the one that wasn't as good.

1:34:48.380 --> 1:34:52.280
 And people have found that I, you know, I have an interesting way of talking.

1:34:52.280 --> 1:34:54.740
 They didn't know what that meant, but yeah.

1:34:54.740 --> 1:34:58.560
 So it builds a good foundation for a language is getting a large vocabulary.

1:34:58.560 --> 1:34:59.560
 Yes.

1:34:59.560 --> 1:35:00.560
 It's really interesting.

1:35:00.560 --> 1:35:03.840
 There's something I do, which is called space repetition, which is a programmatic way of

1:35:03.840 --> 1:35:09.700
 doing this kind of system that you've developed yourself, which is if you successfully remember

1:35:09.700 --> 1:35:14.560
 a thing, it's going to be a longer time before it brings it up to you again.

1:35:14.560 --> 1:35:15.560
 Yeah.

1:35:15.560 --> 1:35:20.060
 Now that's requires a computer to keep track of information.

1:35:20.060 --> 1:35:22.680
 If you have cars, that's a really interesting pile system.

1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:26.600
 One, two, three, four, five, you upgrade it one, two, three, four, five.

1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:31.360
 Maybe I wouldn't go to the archive and go to them to, to pile one right away.

1:35:31.360 --> 1:35:37.880
 I would go to like, I don't know, pile five, perhaps is probably the right place to put

1:35:37.880 --> 1:35:38.880
 it.

1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:41.840
 Cause, cause you have to go through that full step again, but that is a really powerful

1:35:41.840 --> 1:35:45.960
 way to learn definitely language, but also facts.

1:35:45.960 --> 1:35:47.960
 Like people that go to medical school.

1:35:47.960 --> 1:35:48.960
 Disconnected facts.

1:35:48.960 --> 1:35:49.960
 Yeah.

1:35:49.960 --> 1:35:53.240
 And, and you pretty much, when you're done, you, you know what you know.

1:35:53.240 --> 1:35:54.240
 Yeah.

1:35:54.240 --> 1:35:55.240
 You don't have to.

1:35:55.240 --> 1:35:57.640
 Then again, to use it, to integrate it into the music of language.

1:35:57.640 --> 1:35:58.640
 That's more difficult.

1:35:58.640 --> 1:35:59.640
 That's what you're talking about.

1:35:59.640 --> 1:36:00.640
 Yeah.

1:36:00.640 --> 1:36:01.640
 There's a charm.

1:36:01.640 --> 1:36:06.960
 I mean, maybe it's not good for Spycraft, but there's a charm to this kind of, to having

1:36:06.960 --> 1:36:14.000
 an accent and using words incorrectly, but confidently there's a, because language isn't

1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:16.180
 a simple formula.

1:36:16.180 --> 1:36:17.480
 Language is the play of words.

1:36:17.480 --> 1:36:25.680
 So actually using the incorrect synonym, you know, as it, you know, if, instead of saying

1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:28.960
 I'm cold saying I'm chilled or something.

1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:33.120
 Like using off beat words can actually be part of the charm.

1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:35.800
 So it's interesting if you can learn how to use that correctly.

1:36:35.800 --> 1:36:40.640
 Cause I've known a bunch of people with the Russian accent and I feel like they get, get

1:36:40.640 --> 1:36:45.400
 away with saying a lot of ridiculous shit because they're able to sort of leverage the

1:36:45.400 --> 1:36:47.440
 charm of the non sequiturs.

1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:53.400
 And by the way, by the way, just one, one thing that we talked about using a computer.

1:36:53.400 --> 1:36:59.080
 When I had my first personal computer, I actually wrote a program that does that.

1:36:59.080 --> 1:37:00.080
 It does that.

1:37:00.080 --> 1:37:01.280
 By the way, when was that?

1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:06.000
 When, cause you were a world class programmer for a time.

1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:07.000
 Yeah.

1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:08.000
 You were a very good programmer.

1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:09.000
 When, when did the birth?

1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:10.560
 First PC was probably 1984.

1:37:10.560 --> 1:37:11.560
 1984.

1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:13.920
 When did you fall in love with programming?

1:37:13.920 --> 1:37:19.560
 When I went to college in the US and part of the core curriculum was that you were required

1:37:19.560 --> 1:37:26.440
 to take a course in computer and it was mostly just, you know, talk, but we also had to learn

1:37:26.440 --> 1:37:27.440
 a language.

1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:35.080
 Uh, we had to write some programs and Fortran, which was what five at the time, it was a,

1:37:35.080 --> 1:37:43.080
 it was a dumbed down Fortran, but listen, so I, I see the ability, I see what, what

1:37:43.080 --> 1:37:50.080
 you can do with this, I programmed a sine curve and then I divided the, the sine curve

1:37:50.080 --> 1:37:55.840
 into really, really small rectangles and then ran the program and it came up with the right

1:37:55.840 --> 1:37:56.840
 area.

1:37:56.840 --> 1:37:57.840
 Wow.

1:37:57.840 --> 1:37:58.840
 This is great.

1:37:58.840 --> 1:37:59.840
 That's incredible.

1:37:59.840 --> 1:38:00.840
 It's incredible.

1:38:00.840 --> 1:38:01.840
 That's so powerful.

1:38:01.840 --> 1:38:08.640
 It's, uh, you're creating, you're creating a little helper helps you understand the world

1:38:08.640 --> 1:38:10.720
 to help you analyze the world and so on.

1:38:10.720 --> 1:38:13.520
 Uh, we'll, we'll return to that cause it's interesting.

1:38:13.520 --> 1:38:16.560
 So you have so many interesting aspects to your life, but Moscow.

1:38:16.560 --> 1:38:17.560
 So

1:38:17.560 --> 1:38:20.760
 Yeah, no, let me, let, no, let me, how I was sent to Moscow.

1:38:20.760 --> 1:38:21.760
 Okay.

1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:27.360
 So one day I had a visitor from Moscow, uh, and he came to visit me in my apartment, uh,

1:38:27.360 --> 1:38:33.080
 together with, uh, Nikolai and he, you know, we talked and then he said, how's your English?

1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:37.680
 I said, I pulled a book from the shelf and says, I can read that without the help of

1:38:37.680 --> 1:38:38.680
 a dictionary.

1:38:38.680 --> 1:38:41.000
 Oh, that's interesting.

1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:48.440
 And he said, you know what, we're going to send you a tape recorder and you just talk,

1:38:48.440 --> 1:38:52.280
 say something, you know, for 20 minutes, whatever you want to talk about.

1:38:52.280 --> 1:39:00.700
 Uh, they sent this thing and two weeks later I was on a plane to Moscow because I also

1:39:00.700 --> 1:39:07.760
 spoke English, sort of the British variety of English with not a strong German accent

1:39:07.760 --> 1:39:15.320
 because I've always had the ability to imitate others and sounds that was an innate ability.

1:39:15.320 --> 1:39:21.160
 I would, uh, you know, when, when, when we were in a lab and, uh, as students, I would

1:39:21.160 --> 1:39:27.000
 very often do, uh, monologues, uh, imitating East German comedians.

1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:30.140
 You know, I just, yes, yes.

1:39:30.140 --> 1:39:37.600
 I'm not good enough to make a living out of it, but, uh, that raised some interest.

1:39:37.600 --> 1:39:43.120
 And so when they sent me to Moscow, that was the first time on a plane, by the way, um,

1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:47.280
 and, uh, I had a conversation with two ladies who spoke English.

1:39:47.280 --> 1:39:52.760
 One was a, a Russian, a professor at, uh, Lomonosov University.

1:39:52.760 --> 1:39:55.380
 She was obviously KGB, that was her cover.

1:39:55.380 --> 1:39:58.000
 And the other one was an American born lady.

1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:02.360
 Oh, by the way, she was an actual professor and using that as the cover or is it just

1:40:02.360 --> 1:40:03.360
 a story?

1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:06.280
 No, I, she said she was a professor.

1:40:06.280 --> 1:40:08.120
 She may have taught there too.

1:40:08.120 --> 1:40:09.120
 That's an interesting distinction.

1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:10.120
 Yeah.

1:40:10.120 --> 1:40:14.360
 One is like a story you tell people and one is like you legit are doing the thing, but

1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:16.360
 are also as a cover.

1:40:16.360 --> 1:40:22.920
 Anyway, that's, that's an interesting aspect of how to be a good liar.

1:40:22.920 --> 1:40:25.200
 You might, you might as well live the lie.

1:40:25.200 --> 1:40:26.520
 Yeah, exactly right.

1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:31.860
 Uh, so, uh, and the other one was a middle aged, the, the Russian was pretty young.

1:40:31.860 --> 1:40:37.640
 The other one was middle aged and American and, uh, and so we talked for maybe a couple

1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:42.680
 of hours and then they withdrew and I was left alone.

1:40:42.680 --> 1:40:49.920
 Eventually my liaison, he came back in and he said, it was close, but the American thinks

1:40:49.920 --> 1:40:56.720
 you can actually, uh, become, uh, you get close enough to become, becoming a native

1:40:56.720 --> 1:40:59.040
 speaker of American English.

1:40:59.040 --> 1:41:02.000
 And he said, the Russian was very doubtful.

1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:08.100
 So I think wishful, it was, it was a tie, literally wishful thinking prevailed.

1:41:08.100 --> 1:41:15.560
 So, uh, within a couple of weeks I was moving to Moscow.

1:41:15.560 --> 1:41:21.000
 And what, what was the task in Moscow and what, how long were you in Moscow?

1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:22.360
 Two years.

1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:24.840
 And what was the task there?

1:41:24.840 --> 1:41:26.680
 Is it training or is it espionage?

1:41:26.680 --> 1:41:27.880
 No, it was training.

1:41:27.880 --> 1:41:33.280
 It was, uh, so it was, uh, I, uh, the, the American born became my tutor.

1:41:33.280 --> 1:41:35.560
 I met with her twice a week.

1:41:35.560 --> 1:41:45.360
 Uh, I, uh, I also listened to a lot of BBC, shortwave BBC worldwide, uh, I read, uh, more

1:41:45.360 --> 1:41:46.360
 English books.

1:41:46.360 --> 1:41:51.040
 So a lot of that was about the language and the culture of English, uh, American.

1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:57.960
 And, and I did phonetics exercises every night.

1:41:57.960 --> 1:42:05.720
 I had a tape that was about a half hour long and they would say a word and I would repeat

1:42:05.720 --> 1:42:07.720
 the word, say a word, repeat the word.

1:42:07.720 --> 1:42:13.560
 And it was mostly about the vowels, by the way, most of the accent and, uh, uh, particularly

1:42:13.560 --> 1:42:18.560
 because let's say coming from German into, into English, but also Russian.

1:42:18.560 --> 1:42:19.560
 It's the vowels.

1:42:19.560 --> 1:42:23.680
 You're talking about the, so you would have a single word, a word, apple, and you would

1:42:23.680 --> 1:42:24.680
 just say apple.

1:42:24.680 --> 1:42:25.680
 Yes.

1:42:25.680 --> 1:42:28.040
 And American English or British English?

1:42:28.040 --> 1:42:29.040
 No, American English.

1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:34.200
 And, and I give you one, uh, example that almost nobody gets right.

1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:43.200
 The difference between hot and hut, you know, and in German speakers, it's very tough.

1:42:43.200 --> 1:42:46.200
 You know, which one, uh, for everyone is different.

1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:51.240
 For example, uh, I could say this on a podcast, something that my brother struggles with,

1:42:51.240 --> 1:42:56.600
 I struggled with too, when I first came to this country to learn English is there's differences.

1:42:56.600 --> 1:43:02.320
 There's embarrassing differences, uh, like beach and bitch, right?

1:43:02.320 --> 1:43:06.120
 And you get so, as a young kid, also you get so nervous of, I don't want to say the wrong

1:43:06.120 --> 1:43:07.120
 thing.

1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:12.600
 I, um, I can also say that this is almost as a jokey thing, but, uh, there's a, there's

1:43:12.600 --> 1:43:18.280
 a famous philosopher, uh, Immanuel Kant, and you can, uh, guess which other word is very

1:43:18.280 --> 1:43:19.280
 similar to that.

1:43:19.280 --> 1:43:24.120
 So there's a, there's a nervousness about the, what is that?

1:43:24.120 --> 1:43:25.120
 That's interesting.

1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:31.600
 I mean, and Germans probably have a different, uh, tension of like what is hard to learn

1:43:31.600 --> 1:43:35.200
 the difference between the pronunciation of the vowels or the control of the vowels.

1:43:35.200 --> 1:43:36.200
 Yeah.

1:43:36.200 --> 1:43:37.200
 It's interesting.

1:43:37.200 --> 1:43:41.600
 So you had to really master this daily exercise and, you know, and this, this was my discipline.

1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:45.200
 I did this every night, routine, boring as hell.

1:43:45.200 --> 1:43:47.800
 Uh, so English was the focus.

1:43:47.800 --> 1:43:53.480
 And I also had interaction with some, uh, agents who had operated in the United States

1:43:53.480 --> 1:43:56.320
 as diplomats on the, on the diplomatic cover.

1:43:56.320 --> 1:44:02.380
 They would come and talk to me a little bit and tell me and sort of prepare me what was

1:44:02.380 --> 1:44:03.380
 ahead of me.

1:44:03.380 --> 1:44:07.720
 And then I did a whole lot of operational training, particularly surveillance detection.

1:44:07.720 --> 1:44:08.720
 That was big.

1:44:08.720 --> 1:44:11.720
 They also, they also taught me how to drive a car in Moscow.

1:44:11.720 --> 1:44:14.080
 Finally, the one skill you needed.

1:44:14.080 --> 1:44:15.480
 What's a surveillance detection?

1:44:15.480 --> 1:44:16.480
 Okay.

1:44:16.480 --> 1:44:19.360
 So this is what, when, when you find out whether you're being followed.

1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:21.120
 Ah, got it, got it, got it.

1:44:21.120 --> 1:44:22.960
 So it's the, yeah, got you.

1:44:22.960 --> 1:44:30.180
 The abbreviation that's used in, uh, in, in, in, uh, yes, uh, in, uh, intelligence circles

1:44:30.180 --> 1:44:34.320
 is SDR, surveillance detection route, you know, when they say that, you know what that

1:44:34.320 --> 1:44:35.320
 is.

1:44:35.320 --> 1:44:37.000
 Uh, and, and that was it.

1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:44.760
 Uh, and a, and a few other things, you know, one offs, for instance, uh, I was once, uh,

1:44:44.760 --> 1:44:49.000
 taught, uh, to read silhouettes of ships.

1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:54.320
 When you see a ship from a distance, what kind of a ship it might be.

1:44:54.320 --> 1:44:57.520
 They, they thought this would come in handy.

1:44:57.520 --> 1:45:03.840
 Actually they, they, uh, there was in, in 1982, Andropov, uh, started, uh, a campaign

1:45:03.840 --> 1:45:09.200
 that was, uh, now I forget the name, Operation something, something where everybody who was

1:45:09.200 --> 1:45:15.060
 in the West was supposed to, uh, look for science that, uh, the West was, uh, uh, getting

1:45:15.060 --> 1:45:16.940
 ready for war.

1:45:16.940 --> 1:45:21.960
 And I had an, everybody had an object to, uh, to pay attention to.

1:45:21.960 --> 1:45:31.440
 I had a, uh, uh, a harbor, a military harbor in, um, um, in, in New Jersey, uh, near Red

1:45:31.440 --> 1:45:35.720
 Bank that was called Earl Weapon Station.

1:45:35.720 --> 1:45:37.520
 And the code name for that was early.

1:45:37.520 --> 1:45:44.960
 So they asked me to just wander by there to see if there was something unusual going on

1:45:44.960 --> 1:45:49.640
 because the Soviet Union were at that point, it was Ronald Reagan were really afraid that

1:45:49.640 --> 1:45:51.520
 Reagan was going to start a war.

1:45:51.520 --> 1:45:54.680
 They were absolutely 100% afraid of him.

1:45:54.680 --> 1:46:00.160
 Is there something memorable to you on a personal level and a philosophical level about your

1:46:00.160 --> 1:46:02.200
 time in Moscow?

1:46:02.200 --> 1:46:07.160
 Something that kind of stays with you outside of the training stuff, maybe like the details

1:46:07.160 --> 1:46:08.160
 of the training.

1:46:08.160 --> 1:46:09.160
 You love the answer.

1:46:09.160 --> 1:46:10.160
 You will love the answer.

1:46:10.160 --> 1:46:19.720
 Uh, I was, uh, I was given tickets to two, uh, performances by Americans.

1:46:19.720 --> 1:46:23.880
 Uh, there was a theater troupe that, uh, played Our Town.

1:46:23.880 --> 1:46:29.660
 Uh, and then there was this, I forgot the name of the guy, but, uh, uh, you may not

1:46:29.660 --> 1:46:30.660
 be old enough.

1:46:30.660 --> 1:46:32.480
 Have you ever watched Hee Haw?

1:46:32.480 --> 1:46:40.720
 Uh, maybe, uh, there was a, it was a country music show, real kitschy, but, uh, the star

1:46:40.720 --> 1:46:47.880
 of Hee Haw, uh, was giving a concert in Moscow and I guarantee you at least half the audience

1:46:47.880 --> 1:46:59.400
 were KGB and at the other end, the, uh, uh, um, the, the, the opposite of, uh, of a, of

1:46:59.400 --> 1:47:09.680
 a highlight was my visit to the, uh, to, to my, to the mausoleum where Lenin, uh, is still,

1:47:09.680 --> 1:47:10.680
 still today.

1:47:10.680 --> 1:47:18.340
 There, there was so, there was a nothing, you know, he was, he was my hero, but he,

1:47:18.340 --> 1:47:24.080
 he looked like a wax figure and, and, and you walk by there, there was nothing inspirational

1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:30.360
 and not, not, it was not a religious experience, nothing, it was, it was a big old nothing.

1:47:30.360 --> 1:47:36.960
 Is that, did, did your faith and belief in communism start to crumble at some point here?

1:47:36.960 --> 1:47:37.960
 No.

1:47:37.960 --> 1:47:39.760
 Is that around, that was still pretty strong.

1:47:39.760 --> 1:47:44.880
 What I did notice that, uh, the standard of living in, in, in Moscow was significantly

1:47:44.880 --> 1:47:47.100
 lower than in East Germany.

1:47:47.100 --> 1:47:54.140
 The, uh, uh, in the supermarkets, uh, you could, you could expect, uh, with reliability

1:47:54.140 --> 1:47:58.220
 that you can find, uh, canned fish and, uh, mineral water.

1:47:58.220 --> 1:48:00.600
 Everything else was whatever.

1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:04.120
 And if you saw a line and at a store, you just line up.

1:48:04.120 --> 1:48:08.400
 You don't even ask what they have because if you don't like it, somebody else will.

1:48:08.400 --> 1:48:14.400
 It was, it, it was, uh, not poverty, but it was close to poverty.

1:48:14.400 --> 1:48:18.000
 There were a lot of drunken men in the streets.

1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:19.000
 And uh...

1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:20.000
 This is the eighties?

1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:24.080
 No, this is the late seventies, mid to late seventies.

1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:29.640
 And uh, and also the, they had these high rise apartment buildings that looked pretty

1:48:29.640 --> 1:48:34.720
 good from the front, but you went into the backyard, ouch.

1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:35.720
 You know.

1:48:35.720 --> 1:48:36.720
 Yeah.

1:48:36.720 --> 1:48:37.720
 You're describing my childhood here.

1:48:37.720 --> 1:48:38.720
 Okay.

1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:39.720
 Sorry.

1:48:39.720 --> 1:48:45.440
 Uh, but it's interesting even, even with the professor, even with everything else, um,

1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:49.160
 it's interesting because I think the standard of living was much lower.

1:48:49.160 --> 1:48:50.160
 You're right.

1:48:50.160 --> 1:48:51.160
 Even in Moscow.

1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:52.160
 Yeah.

1:48:52.160 --> 1:48:53.160
 Absolutely was.

1:48:53.160 --> 1:48:56.720
 The one thing that they always had, at least in my days, was in those two years, there

1:48:56.720 --> 1:48:58.960
 was always fresh bread in the Bulatnoyars.

1:48:58.960 --> 1:48:59.960
 Yeah.

1:48:59.960 --> 1:49:00.960
 Always.

1:49:00.960 --> 1:49:01.960
 Yeah.

1:49:01.960 --> 1:49:07.480
 That's probably one of the memories I have of childhood is, well you're hungry a lot,

1:49:07.480 --> 1:49:11.280
 but when you eat is bread and the bread was good.

1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:12.280
 It was good.

1:49:12.280 --> 1:49:18.800
 I mean, I don't, I actually wonder, I wonder how good it was, but I remember it being incredibly

1:49:18.800 --> 1:49:19.800
 good.

1:49:19.800 --> 1:49:21.320
 To me it was really good.

1:49:21.320 --> 1:49:26.120
 And, and you know, you had it from white to very dark and all the varieties.

1:49:26.120 --> 1:49:32.160
 The other thing that was good was, um, if you knew where to get it, Stolichnaya was

1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:36.320
 four rubles.

1:49:36.320 --> 1:49:39.760
 Not only is it good vodka, but it's a cheap vodka.

1:49:39.760 --> 1:49:40.760
 I like it.

1:49:40.760 --> 1:49:41.760
 Yeah.

1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:45.000
 But you had to know where, you know, this would be like holes in the wall someplace.

1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:48.920
 Well, I think a lot of the way they operate, I don't, I wonder if East Germany is this

1:49:48.920 --> 1:49:53.920
 way, but a lot of the ways that Moscow operate is you kind of, you had to know.

1:49:53.920 --> 1:49:54.920
 Yes.

1:49:54.920 --> 1:50:01.440
 Like there's a very kind of, um, if you make the right friends, if you give money to the

1:50:01.440 --> 1:50:05.760
 right guy, the guy, the friend of the friend of the friend is going to hook you up and

1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:11.640
 that's, there's a culture that this is how you work around a very big bureaucracy.

1:50:11.640 --> 1:50:12.640
 Underground economy.

1:50:12.640 --> 1:50:13.640
 Yeah.

1:50:13.640 --> 1:50:14.640
 Underground economy.

1:50:14.640 --> 1:50:15.640
 Yeah.

1:50:15.640 --> 1:50:23.880
 You have to know, which is, uh, boy, um, such a stark contrast between, between that and

1:50:23.880 --> 1:50:26.680
 the United States, the capitalist system.

1:50:26.680 --> 1:50:35.360
 Um, yeah, that was a very big culture shock to me to understand the different, the different

1:50:35.360 --> 1:50:36.920
 fundamentally different way of life.

1:50:36.920 --> 1:50:44.280
 But the interesting thing is, um, human nature pervades both systems and there is something

1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:49.720
 about the Russian system that reveals human nature more intensely because of the underground

1:50:49.720 --> 1:50:51.240
 nature of it.

1:50:51.240 --> 1:50:55.920
 Because you get to deal with greed and trust and all those kinds of things in the United

1:50:55.920 --> 1:50:59.280
 States, there is much more power to the rule of law.

1:50:59.280 --> 1:51:05.000
 So there's rules and people follow those rules, they had to break the rules nonstop.

1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:11.320
 Well, in East Germany and Russia, I believe, uh, theft, if you could get away with it was

1:51:11.320 --> 1:51:13.520
 part of your economic activity.

1:51:13.520 --> 1:51:14.520
 Yeah.

1:51:14.520 --> 1:51:20.520
 I have a friend, uh, you know, who, who I went to school with, uh, up until my fourth

1:51:20.520 --> 1:51:25.600
 year and, uh, we reconnected and he told me how he survived, you know, he would, you know,

1:51:25.600 --> 1:51:28.840
 he would just steal stuff and then sell it and trade it.

1:51:28.840 --> 1:51:29.840
 Yeah.

1:51:29.840 --> 1:51:30.840
 Thefts.

1:51:30.840 --> 1:51:32.320
 I mean, it's a relative concept.

1:51:32.320 --> 1:51:34.120
 You are taking stuff.

1:51:34.120 --> 1:51:41.320
 Uh, bribery, all those kinds of things, people, you know, um, corruption, you know, it's a

1:51:41.320 --> 1:51:42.320
 relative term.

1:51:42.320 --> 1:51:43.320
 No, I'm just kidding.

1:51:43.320 --> 1:51:48.980
 I mean, it is, you have to work around the giant bureaucracy about the giant corruption.

1:51:48.980 --> 1:51:53.080
 Corruption builds on top of corruption and then it just becomes this giant system that's

1:51:53.080 --> 1:51:55.800
 unstable as you talked about.

1:51:55.800 --> 1:51:56.800
 One last word.

1:51:56.800 --> 1:51:57.800
 Yes.

1:51:57.800 --> 1:52:05.920
 The two years in Moscow taught me how to be alone.

1:52:05.920 --> 1:52:08.880
 I had no social interaction.

1:52:08.880 --> 1:52:11.560
 Not with friends, not with women, not.

1:52:11.560 --> 1:52:12.560
 No.

1:52:12.560 --> 1:52:16.540
 I was, the only interaction I had was with the folks that trained me.

1:52:16.540 --> 1:52:17.540
 So I was alone.

1:52:17.540 --> 1:52:20.720
 It was a lonely two years.

1:52:20.720 --> 1:52:22.680
 For a person who, who loves love.

1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:23.680
 Yes.

1:52:23.680 --> 1:52:24.680
 Is that difficult?

1:52:24.680 --> 1:52:30.400
 It was for my first year and first and second year in the United States because I could

1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:35.080
 not interact socially without giving away that something was wrong with me.

1:52:35.080 --> 1:52:37.500
 I had to learn how to be an American.

1:52:37.500 --> 1:52:39.200
 They didn't teach me in Moscow.

1:52:39.200 --> 1:52:40.200
 They couldn't.

1:52:40.200 --> 1:52:46.080
 So the first two years in, uh, in America, you had to kind of listen more than talk.

1:52:46.080 --> 1:52:47.080
 Oh, you bet.

1:52:47.080 --> 1:52:51.940
 The very first year I couldn't even work because I had to acquire the documents, the social

1:52:51.940 --> 1:52:56.800
 security card and a driver's license, uh, to get a job.

1:52:56.800 --> 1:53:03.340
 And then when I had the job, uh, I worked as a bike messenger, uh, that gave me a good

1:53:03.340 --> 1:53:10.640
 opportunity to listen as, as, you know, because these people, they weren't very curious about

1:53:10.640 --> 1:53:11.640
 me.

1:53:11.640 --> 1:53:16.440
 What was your name in East Germany, what was your name in Moscow, what was your name in

1:53:16.440 --> 1:53:17.440
 America?

1:53:17.440 --> 1:53:18.440
 Okay.

1:53:18.440 --> 1:53:21.840
 So my, the name I was given at birth is Albrecht Dittrich.

1:53:21.840 --> 1:53:25.720
 It's so sexy when you speak in German with a German accent.

1:53:25.720 --> 1:53:27.840
 I hate, I hated that name, the Albrecht.

1:53:27.840 --> 1:53:28.840
 I didn't like it.

1:53:28.840 --> 1:53:30.760
 It was, it was very rarely used.

1:53:30.760 --> 1:53:36.140
 Uh, my mother named me after a famous German painter, Albrecht Dittrich.

1:53:36.140 --> 1:53:42.960
 My cover name in Moscow was known as Dieter and, and, and in the United States I became

1:53:42.960 --> 1:53:44.520
 Jack Barsky.

1:53:44.520 --> 1:53:50.440
 In between I used a whole bunch of other names that were associated with, uh, false passports

1:53:50.440 --> 1:53:53.900
 that, uh, uh, I used.

1:53:53.900 --> 1:53:59.960
 One of the names I remember is William Dyson because that is the name that was on the Canadian

1:53:59.960 --> 1:54:02.320
 passport I used to enter the United States.

1:54:02.320 --> 1:54:03.880
 So how did you enter the United States?

1:54:03.880 --> 1:54:06.720
 Can we take the journey from Moscow to the United States?

1:54:06.720 --> 1:54:07.720
 Yeah.

1:54:07.720 --> 1:54:08.720
 What was the assignment?

1:54:08.720 --> 1:54:12.000
 What was the, what was that leap?

1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:13.900
 What was like, what, uh.

1:54:13.900 --> 1:54:20.680
 Just one, one, one thing in between, I had a three months practice trip to, to, uh, Canada.

1:54:20.680 --> 1:54:25.080
 That was, that was a good idea and I got to tell you this, this one thing that happened

1:54:25.080 --> 1:54:26.080
 there.

1:54:26.080 --> 1:54:27.080
 Yes, please.

1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:28.080
 Okay.

1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:33.240
 So, because, you know, the one, one thing that I like to tell people nowadays is the,

1:54:33.240 --> 1:54:37.360
 one of the secrets to happiness is the ability to make fun of the worst situations that you're

1:54:37.360 --> 1:54:38.360
 in.

1:54:38.360 --> 1:54:39.360
 Yes, absolutely.

1:54:39.360 --> 1:54:40.360
 You see the humor.

1:54:40.360 --> 1:54:41.360
 Yes.

1:54:41.360 --> 1:54:42.360
 Okay.

1:54:42.360 --> 1:54:47.740
 In hindsight, at least, uh, one of my, uh, the tasks that I had in, in, in Canada was

1:54:47.740 --> 1:54:54.760
 to acquire a birth certificate, uh, with the name, uh, the name was Henry Van Randall,

1:54:54.760 --> 1:54:56.960
 who was born someplace in California.

1:54:56.960 --> 1:55:02.200
 And I was supposed to, uh, you know, write a little letter saying, I'm Henry Van Randall.

1:55:02.200 --> 1:55:04.200
 Please send me a copy of my birth certificate.

1:55:04.200 --> 1:55:11.640
 The fee is enclosed and, uh, and, and I, uh, I lived in a small hotel.

1:55:11.640 --> 1:55:15.200
 So the return address, it wasn't visible that it was a hotel.

1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:16.200
 That was important.

1:55:16.200 --> 1:55:23.600
 So, and it took like three weeks and I get nothing, four weeks, I get nothing.

1:55:23.600 --> 1:55:34.160
 Eventually I got annoyed and I, I, I, I mustered the courage to call them up from a pay phone.

1:55:34.160 --> 1:55:39.320
 I called up the office registrar, whatever they were called in this, in this town in

1:55:39.320 --> 1:55:44.120
 California and I, and I yelled at them, I said, you got my money, where's my birth certificate?

1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:47.160
 Well, a couple of weeks later it came.

1:55:47.160 --> 1:55:50.160
 So I see the envelope and it says Henry Van Randall.

1:55:50.160 --> 1:55:51.160
 Yes.

1:55:51.160 --> 1:55:58.300
 I had prepared the caretakers of the, um, of the hotel to, that I'm expecting a letter

1:55:58.300 --> 1:55:59.600
 from my friend.

1:55:59.600 --> 1:56:04.600
 So I went up to my room, I opened it and I was like, yes, yes, this is success.

1:56:04.600 --> 1:56:09.600
 And then, and then I opened this thing and it was, it was a copy of a birth certificate,

1:56:09.600 --> 1:56:13.840
 but it was stamped with big letters across in red deceased.

1:56:13.840 --> 1:56:15.380
 Now think about it.

1:56:15.380 --> 1:56:22.480
 So here's a dead people who was asking for that person who was asking for a birth certificate.

1:56:22.480 --> 1:56:25.200
 I had the presence of mind to, to leave.

1:56:25.200 --> 1:56:26.360
 Okay.

1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:27.680
 I went to a couple of other cities.

1:56:27.680 --> 1:56:30.280
 I should have left the country.

1:56:30.280 --> 1:56:36.280
 But I know that the Royal Mounted Police was following me and I was given that information

1:56:36.280 --> 1:56:38.280
 by the FBI later on.

1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:39.280
 And they were,

1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:44.920
 You were able to, oh, you were able to at least suspect that at the time through the,

1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:45.920
 the, the,

1:56:45.920 --> 1:56:48.720
 I knew that, I knew that there was trouble.

1:56:48.720 --> 1:56:57.440
 So I, my counter surveillance route, yes, didn't discover anything.

1:56:57.440 --> 1:57:04.480
 So I kept on going, I had to, supposed to, I was supposed to visit two more cities and

1:57:04.480 --> 1:57:06.880
 they were always one step behind.

1:57:06.880 --> 1:57:11.960
 What, what, what is interesting to me is that they didn't catch me on the way out.

1:57:11.960 --> 1:57:14.960
 You have to show your passport to the airline.

1:57:14.960 --> 1:57:18.720
 I mean, I, I, I was known by name.

1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:23.520
 I would then, the path, because I had to give that to the hotel, right.

1:57:23.520 --> 1:57:26.760
 And I, and I escaped with, by a hair.

1:57:26.760 --> 1:57:27.760
 Yeah.

1:57:27.760 --> 1:57:30.880
 They, they would have to keep you on a list, right?

1:57:30.880 --> 1:57:31.880
 Yeah.

1:57:31.880 --> 1:57:33.160
 Yeah, that's interesting.

1:57:33.160 --> 1:57:38.920
 But that requires like a good computerized updated system to track all that stuff.

1:57:38.920 --> 1:57:40.920
 This was Swiss air, so.

1:57:40.920 --> 1:57:42.920
 Well, you got lucky.

1:57:42.920 --> 1:57:43.920
 Yeah.

1:57:43.920 --> 1:57:44.920
 Part of life is luck.

1:57:44.920 --> 1:57:45.920
 You bet.

1:57:45.920 --> 1:57:54.880
 So, so, and, and other than that, the, the trip to Canada was a big success because it,

1:57:54.880 --> 1:58:03.720
 it gave me the culture shock that, that I needed to not be blown out of, out of the

1:58:03.720 --> 1:58:04.720
 water.

1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:06.040
 And when I get, get to the United States.

1:58:06.040 --> 1:58:10.760
 So you hopped a few places in Canada and then Swiss air.

1:58:10.760 --> 1:58:14.120
 I even had a, I even had a relationship with a young lady.

1:58:14.120 --> 1:58:18.640
 A Canadian, French Canadian, regular Canadian.

1:58:18.640 --> 1:58:25.440
 French Canadian, and she, she gave me a book, Winnie the Pooh, because we went to see the

1:58:25.440 --> 1:58:30.320
 movie and then she wrote the dedication, she says, to the nicest German I've ever met.

1:58:30.320 --> 1:58:32.320
 Was she lying?

1:58:32.320 --> 1:58:33.320
 No.

1:58:33.320 --> 1:58:37.240
 Or you don't know, maybe.

1:58:37.240 --> 1:58:41.400
 Speaking of Spycraft, and that, that led to heartbreak too?

1:58:41.400 --> 1:58:42.960
 No.

1:58:42.960 --> 1:58:47.000
 That was sexual.

1:58:47.000 --> 1:58:49.800
 I was not at that point.

1:58:49.800 --> 1:58:50.800
 Ready for love?

1:58:50.800 --> 1:58:51.800
 No.

1:58:51.800 --> 1:58:52.800
 Ready to return to that old.

1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:56.040
 Well, and I was, I was already married in Germany.

1:58:56.040 --> 1:58:57.040
 Okay.

1:58:57.040 --> 1:58:58.560
 That woman I loved.

1:58:58.560 --> 1:59:00.240
 We should return to this.

1:59:00.240 --> 1:59:01.320
 Yeah.

1:59:01.320 --> 1:59:06.440
 So Swiss air, where did you land in the United States?

1:59:06.440 --> 1:59:08.920
 Oh, when I came, where did I land?

1:59:08.920 --> 1:59:17.680
 I, I, American Airlines, a flight from Mexico City to Toronto, but they made me deplane

1:59:17.680 --> 1:59:19.480
 in Chicago.

1:59:19.480 --> 1:59:20.480
 I have no idea.

1:59:20.480 --> 1:59:21.480
 I think this was overengineering.

1:59:21.480 --> 1:59:24.120
 That didn't make any sense to me.

1:59:24.120 --> 1:59:29.440
 You know, why can't a Canadian just take a, take a flight from Mexico City?

1:59:29.440 --> 1:59:31.480
 With this stopover, this kind of nonsense.

1:59:31.480 --> 1:59:32.800
 Yeah, but, okay.

1:59:32.800 --> 1:59:36.680
 But nevertheless, that was it, and then you landed in Chicago.

1:59:36.680 --> 1:59:37.680
 Right.

1:59:37.680 --> 1:59:39.200
 And tell me the story in America.

1:59:39.200 --> 1:59:40.640
 What was the day to day life?

1:59:40.640 --> 1:59:43.120
 Now this is, now you're a spy.

1:59:43.120 --> 1:59:44.120
 No, no, no, no.

1:59:44.120 --> 1:59:47.080
 I got to tell you another funny story.

1:59:47.080 --> 1:59:48.140
 Yes.

1:59:48.140 --> 1:59:55.260
 So it's another, there's two things that happened that could have ended my career as a spy right

1:59:55.260 --> 1:59:56.580
 then and there.

1:59:56.580 --> 2:00:03.720
 So I'm, so I'm, I'm arriving in, in Chicago in the evening.

2:00:03.720 --> 2:00:05.200
 It's already dark.

2:00:05.200 --> 2:00:13.060
 I had no idea what kind of a hotel to take, you know, I picked one out of a, out of yellow

2:00:13.060 --> 2:00:15.900
 pages and got a taxi.

2:00:15.900 --> 2:00:20.920
 When I gave him the address, he looked at me like a little funny, you know, whatever,

2:00:20.920 --> 2:00:21.920
 what do I know?

2:00:21.920 --> 2:00:22.920
 You know, it was keep on going.

2:00:22.920 --> 2:00:29.460
 I need to get, I need to get sleep because I was extremely tense, you know, having gone

2:00:29.460 --> 2:00:32.820
 through customs and border control.

2:00:32.820 --> 2:00:39.680
 So and we were going in the Southern direction and I noticed that the neighborhoods became

2:00:39.680 --> 2:00:41.720
 less and less inviting.

2:00:41.720 --> 2:00:43.720
 Didn't know what that meant either.

2:00:43.720 --> 2:00:50.320
 I get, I enter the hotel, it was a five story brownstone and something else looked funny.

2:00:50.320 --> 2:00:55.760
 So the reception desk was protected by plexiglass.

2:00:55.760 --> 2:01:02.560
 Not having enough background, I didn't know that this was unusual because all I knew that

2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:04.480
 there was a lot of crime in the United States.

2:01:04.480 --> 2:01:07.240
 So I thought maybe every hotel was like that.

2:01:07.240 --> 2:01:12.280
 So I go up into my room and drink a half a bottle of, uh, Johnny Walker red because I,

2:01:12.280 --> 2:01:16.620
 as one does, yeah, because I was so damn tense.

2:01:16.620 --> 2:01:17.800
 I just wanted to sleep.

2:01:17.800 --> 2:01:21.000
 I wanted to get into a coma, which I did.

2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:26.600
 And then the next day I woke up with a head that was twice as big as felt twice as big.

2:01:26.600 --> 2:01:28.040
 But you know, I was prepared.

2:01:28.040 --> 2:01:33.760
 I had aspirin with me, so I killed the headache and went outside to see if I can get something

2:01:33.760 --> 2:01:34.760
 to eat.

2:01:34.760 --> 2:01:39.200
 And, uh, so I was right smack in the middle of the South side of Chicago.

2:01:39.200 --> 2:01:41.680
 I didn't know that the South side of Chicago existed.

2:01:41.680 --> 2:01:44.520
 I found later, I found out where I was.

2:01:44.520 --> 2:01:50.440
 So it was time to go very quickly, uh, go up there.

2:01:50.440 --> 2:01:57.800
 And at that point I decided I would, uh, uh, I would register, uh, at the next hotel on

2:01:57.800 --> 2:01:59.900
 the Jack Barsky.

2:01:59.900 --> 2:02:06.120
 So I went to the bathroom and I tried to kill, kill off, uh, uh, Mr. Dyson by burning his

2:02:06.120 --> 2:02:07.120
 passport.

2:02:07.120 --> 2:02:13.520
 Um, unfortunately I was not trained in how to train passport, uh, how to, how to destroy

2:02:13.520 --> 2:02:20.080
 passports was, uh, so I tried to burn it and these things are flame retardant.

2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:26.720
 And, uh, it created a cloud of smoke and I'm looking up there and there's a smoke detector.

2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:27.720
 Yeah.

2:02:27.720 --> 2:02:28.720
 Oh no.

2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:29.720
 Okay.

2:02:29.720 --> 2:02:33.400
 So presence of mind, I threw this thing in the toilet and then, then took out a pair

2:02:33.400 --> 2:02:36.880
 of scissors and cut it into small pieces and flushed it down.

2:02:36.880 --> 2:02:40.160
 If that smoke alarm goes off, I'm busted.

2:02:40.160 --> 2:02:41.160
 Right.

2:02:41.160 --> 2:02:46.840
 If somebody, if, if some, some criminal steals, I had $6,000 on me in cash, uh, steals either

2:02:46.840 --> 2:02:51.400
 my passport or my, or my money or both.

2:02:51.400 --> 2:02:52.400
 I don't know what to do.

2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:53.400
 Yeah.

2:02:53.400 --> 2:02:54.400
 You can't go to the authorities.

2:02:54.400 --> 2:02:55.400
 You can't do anything.

2:02:55.400 --> 2:02:56.880
 There weren't, there weren't any Russian, the Soviets in Chicago.

2:02:56.880 --> 2:02:58.840
 Do you have any contacts?

2:02:58.840 --> 2:02:59.840
 No.

2:02:59.840 --> 2:03:06.080
 There was no, there was no, um, there was no plan B for Chicago at all.

2:03:06.080 --> 2:03:07.080
 That's an oversight.

2:03:07.080 --> 2:03:09.000
 I shouldn't, I shouldn't have gone to Chicago.

2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:15.340
 They, they could have shipped me into, uh, um, uh, San Francisco or Washington DC because

2:03:15.340 --> 2:03:17.360
 both of them had Soviets.

2:03:17.360 --> 2:03:22.160
 My end goal was, uh, was to go to, to, to New York.

2:03:22.160 --> 2:03:23.160
 Fine.

2:03:23.160 --> 2:03:27.680
 Uh, you know, I would have been a really, really, uh, dangerous agent if I had gone

2:03:27.680 --> 2:03:32.720
 back and worked with the KGB because I could have told them all the things, how to do it

2:03:32.720 --> 2:03:33.720
 right.

2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:34.720
 Right.

2:03:34.720 --> 2:03:40.960
 So in that sense, there is some, given the scale of the KGB, there is, uh, some incompetence

2:03:40.960 --> 2:03:41.960
 in this.

2:03:41.960 --> 2:03:42.960
 Some.

2:03:42.960 --> 2:03:43.960
 A lot of incompetence.

2:03:43.960 --> 2:03:47.800
 Uh, to preparing me to be an American was almost total incompetence.

2:03:47.800 --> 2:03:52.200
 And that, do you think that's representative of the way they operate is, uh, there's an

2:03:52.200 --> 2:04:00.080
 incompetence like to the, uh, logistics, to the strategies involved, all that kind of

2:04:00.080 --> 2:04:01.080
 stuff.

2:04:01.080 --> 2:04:02.080
 Yeah.

2:04:02.080 --> 2:04:03.920
 None of these guys had operated as illegals.

2:04:03.920 --> 2:04:06.920
 They, they were outsiders to American society.

2:04:06.920 --> 2:04:12.200
 They had interaction with Americans and, uh, but they all lived in, you know, in New York,

2:04:12.200 --> 2:04:16.640
 they lived in a compound, uh, and in Northern Manhattan where they all lived together with

2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:17.640
 their families.

2:04:17.640 --> 2:04:22.680
 And, and they, most of the time they spent, uh, interacting with, with themselves, with

2:04:22.680 --> 2:04:24.600
 their own people at work.

2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:26.260
 So they really didn't integrate well.

2:04:26.260 --> 2:04:32.440
 They did not know what it's like to be an American, to have a job, to, to, you know,

2:04:32.440 --> 2:04:33.440
 live like an American.

2:04:33.440 --> 2:04:34.440
 They didn't know it.

2:04:34.440 --> 2:04:39.040
 It's interesting that KGB didn't put a high value to that kind of integration.

2:04:39.040 --> 2:04:40.640
 They didn't know what they didn't know.

2:04:40.640 --> 2:04:41.640
 Yeah.

2:04:41.640 --> 2:04:42.640
 And by the way, this was mutual.

2:04:42.640 --> 2:04:47.320
 Do you think the CIA had, had, uh, good knowledge of the Russian culture?

2:04:47.320 --> 2:04:49.160
 Uh, same thing.

2:04:49.160 --> 2:04:54.880
 And so, um, there was a lot of lack of understanding because good, good intelligence could have,

2:04:54.880 --> 2:05:00.160
 uh, possibly avoided some of the, uh, high tension that, uh, situations that we had when,

2:05:00.160 --> 2:05:03.880
 when in the eighties, we got close to nuclear war.

2:05:03.880 --> 2:05:07.280
 So good intelligence would be integrating yourself in society.

2:05:07.280 --> 2:05:08.280
 Yes.

2:05:08.280 --> 2:05:09.280
 Much, much deeper.

2:05:09.280 --> 2:05:14.080
 And that Ronald Reagan was not a warmonger, but he was talking about the end times because

2:05:14.080 --> 2:05:16.560
 he was a Christian.

2:05:16.560 --> 2:05:21.840
 But then that kind of integration can be dangerous because you start to question the propaganda,

2:05:21.840 --> 2:05:26.640
 the narratives that, on which the KGB is built, on which the CIA is built.

2:05:26.640 --> 2:05:31.840
 And then they have, they always have had the option of ignoring the intelligence that they're

2:05:31.840 --> 2:05:32.840
 getting, right?

2:05:32.840 --> 2:05:33.840
 Yeah.

2:05:33.840 --> 2:05:37.320
 Well, let me ask you this question sort of to jump around.

2:05:37.320 --> 2:05:42.440
 There's a lot of conspiracy theories in this, um, in this current climate, I mean, throughout

2:05:42.440 --> 2:05:50.520
 history, but now especially, and some of the conspiracy theories put a lot of power in

2:05:50.520 --> 2:05:59.280
 the hands of the intelligence agencies like CIA, FSB, Mossad, uh, MI6, they're basically

2:05:59.280 --> 2:06:06.360
 the conspiracy theories go that they control the powerful people in this world.

2:06:06.360 --> 2:06:13.000
 And are able to thereby manipulate those powerful people and manipulate the populace in order

2:06:13.000 --> 2:06:16.820
 to deliver different kinds of messages and so on.

2:06:16.820 --> 2:06:23.040
 Given your experience with this kind of tension between competence and malevolence, would

2:06:23.040 --> 2:06:27.120
 you say there's some truth to those conspiracy theories?

2:06:27.120 --> 2:06:28.500
 Not one way.

2:06:28.500 --> 2:06:33.920
 I think, I think there is, there's collusion, there's collaboration, but I would think that,

2:06:33.920 --> 2:06:39.680
 uh, like for instance, uh, uh, some folks in the CIA and the FBI, uh, are being used

2:06:39.680 --> 2:06:42.680
 by the ones that are really in power.

2:06:42.680 --> 2:06:43.680
 Power is money.

2:06:43.680 --> 2:06:44.680
 Power is wealth.

2:06:44.680 --> 2:06:49.720
 I know power is not the other, it can go both directions.

2:06:49.720 --> 2:06:55.160
 You can acquire wealth first, which leads you to power, or you can acquire power first.

2:06:55.160 --> 2:06:56.160
 Yeah.

2:06:56.160 --> 2:07:02.000
 Power is also knowledge, I understand, and, and, uh, and a position in the society, in

2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:05.920
 the military or in intelligence, but I don't think it's a straight one way that all the

2:07:05.920 --> 2:07:09.780
 intelligence agencies control the powerful people in their country.

2:07:09.780 --> 2:07:11.120
 You see what's happening in Russia.

2:07:11.120 --> 2:07:17.440
 I mean, Putin dominates his intelligence agencies, right?

2:07:17.440 --> 2:07:22.400
 Well, uh, so the question is which way the direction goes, but you're saying that there

2:07:22.400 --> 2:07:25.680
 is, um, it's not one way flow of power.

2:07:25.680 --> 2:07:27.240
 I would think so.

2:07:27.240 --> 2:07:32.720
 It, and, and I also believe it exists, but it's not as prevalent as, you know, not every

2:07:32.720 --> 2:07:38.440
 conspiracy theory, uh, pans out and most of them don't, they're just damn rumors, but

2:07:38.440 --> 2:07:39.760
 that doesn't mean they don't exist.

2:07:39.760 --> 2:07:41.320
 I guarantee you that they exist.

2:07:41.320 --> 2:07:47.640
 There's collusion, there's people getting together and, uh, not necessarily, uh, preparing

2:07:47.640 --> 2:07:53.720
 a specific action, but more sort of a plan to go forward and maintain the position or

2:07:53.720 --> 2:07:58.240
 even, you know, uh, uh, strengthen the position that they already have.

2:07:58.240 --> 2:08:05.200
 So KGB, but we can generalize this, FSB, CIA, do you think a KGB agent would kill someone

2:08:05.200 --> 2:08:08.480
 against international law if they were ordered to do so?

2:08:08.480 --> 2:08:09.480
 So we talked about...

2:08:09.480 --> 2:08:10.480
 They did.

2:08:10.480 --> 2:08:11.480
 They did.

2:08:11.480 --> 2:08:21.240
 Uh, and there's, uh, there's a famous, uh, case of, uh, one, uh, uh, I think it's Vasily

2:08:21.240 --> 2:08:24.120
 Kuklov who defected.

2:08:24.120 --> 2:08:25.120
 He was a killer.

2:08:25.120 --> 2:08:31.360
 He was a trained killer and he had, had, uh, done assassinations in other countries.

2:08:31.360 --> 2:08:37.520
 He was sent to West Germany to kill a defector, a KGB defector, and he decided not to do it.

2:08:37.520 --> 2:08:40.200
 He, he talked to the guy and he said, I'm supposed to kill you.

2:08:40.200 --> 2:08:41.200
 I'm not.

2:08:41.200 --> 2:08:44.240
 And then, and he eventually wound up in the United States.

2:08:44.240 --> 2:08:50.400
 I have a connection to this fellow because the KGB once asked me to go to California

2:08:50.400 --> 2:08:53.920
 and see if the guy still lives and works there.

2:08:53.920 --> 2:09:03.160
 And, uh, we, uh, I found him and we looked at each other.

2:09:03.160 --> 2:09:10.360
 So there was an active KGB agent looking at a man that he didn't know was the KGB defector,

2:09:10.360 --> 2:09:11.360
 looking at each other.

2:09:11.360 --> 2:09:13.440
 Neither one knew who the other one was.

2:09:13.440 --> 2:09:15.000
 I found out later.

2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:18.040
 But he was able to survive.

2:09:18.040 --> 2:09:19.040
 Yes.

2:09:19.040 --> 2:09:24.240
 And, you know, there, there have been assassinations, not, not a lot.

2:09:24.240 --> 2:09:29.000
 And, uh, you know, that, that we know of, a good point.

2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:36.040
 This is very difficult, uh, the, the, the, the, the question is how many lines are intelligence

2:09:36.040 --> 2:09:42.920
 agencies able, willing to cross to attain, to achieve the goal?

2:09:42.920 --> 2:09:48.800
 I, I think none of these agencies have the ultimate line.

2:09:48.800 --> 2:09:55.600
 I think eventually they, the last line will be crossed if they believe it's necessary.

2:09:55.600 --> 2:10:00.040
 Well, I think you can justify a lot of things, especially in this modern world with nuclear

2:10:00.040 --> 2:10:04.680
 weapons that you can justify that you're saving the world actually.

2:10:04.680 --> 2:10:08.400
 Let me ask a few difficult questions and we'll jump back to your time in America.

2:10:08.400 --> 2:10:17.360
 But Vladimir Putin has been accused of ordering the poisoning and assassination of several

2:10:17.360 --> 2:10:23.480
 people, including Alexander Levinenko early on all the way to Alexei Navalny.

2:10:23.480 --> 2:10:27.460
 Do you think these accusations are grounded in truth?

2:10:27.460 --> 2:10:34.200
 And we will return to a couple more questions maybe about Vladimir Putin's early days in

2:10:34.200 --> 2:10:36.200
 the KGB, which would be interesting.

2:10:36.200 --> 2:10:37.200
 Yeah.

2:10:37.200 --> 2:10:40.980
 There, there's a, there's a phrase that I like to, uh, say in the response is called

2:10:40.980 --> 2:10:43.200
 plausible deniability.

2:10:43.200 --> 2:10:46.860
 I don't think Putin gave a direct command as they do that.

2:10:46.860 --> 2:10:48.280
 He would just maybe muse.

2:10:48.280 --> 2:10:54.980
 It would be nice if something were to happen and then somebody picks it up and does it.

2:10:54.980 --> 2:11:01.040
 Is there, can you steel man the case that, uh, Putin did not have direct or indirect

2:11:01.040 --> 2:11:02.040
 involvement with this?

2:11:02.040 --> 2:11:04.520
 Who, who, who would know, who would know?

2:11:04.520 --> 2:11:14.720
 You know, just the, the international, the reputation perhaps, um, perhaps catalyzed

2:11:14.720 --> 2:11:20.280
 by Putin himself is that he is the kind of person that would directly or indirectly make

2:11:20.280 --> 2:11:22.000
 those orders.

2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:27.120
 Perhaps the case there is he's somebody to be feared and thereby you want that person

2:11:27.120 --> 2:11:28.120
 out there.

2:11:28.120 --> 2:11:37.360
 Uh, but the act itself, uh, the, the, the poisoning of, uh, Litvinenko and, uh, Oh,

2:11:37.360 --> 2:11:43.680
 and then the assassination of the Bulgarian, uh, Markov and with a, with the umbrella

2:11:43.680 --> 2:11:49.960
 and, and they all directly traced back to Russian, uh, Soviet intelligence.

2:11:49.960 --> 2:11:54.680
 Uh, and so that's enough to be feared, right?

2:11:54.680 --> 2:12:01.800
 Um, my answer that I gave you is an educated guess, you know, I can't pretend to know this

2:12:01.800 --> 2:12:02.800
 for sure, but

2:12:02.800 --> 2:12:07.720
 It's frustrating to me because there's a lot of people listening to this would say,

2:12:07.720 --> 2:12:15.440
 but even, uh, sort of would chuckle at the naive nature of the question.

2:12:15.440 --> 2:12:20.400
 But if you actually keep an open mind, you have to understand what is the way that intelligence

2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:21.880
 agencies function?

2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:29.520
 Is it possible to the head of an intelligence agency not to make direct orders of that kind

2:12:29.520 --> 2:12:30.760
 where there's a distributed

2:12:30.760 --> 2:12:34.880
 No, the head of the intelligence agency would most likely give the order.

2:12:34.880 --> 2:12:36.440
 Even though it's compartmentalized.

2:12:36.440 --> 2:12:39.920
 Yeah, but, but, uh, but not the head of state.

2:12:39.920 --> 2:12:46.760
 Not maybe not the head of state, although, uh, in the case, this is the case in the United

2:12:46.760 --> 2:12:50.160
 States as well, but certainly is the case in Russia.

2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:55.840
 There are close relationships between the head of the FSB and the GRU and personal relationships,

2:12:55.840 --> 2:12:56.840
 not just even

2:12:56.840 --> 2:13:02.080
 The head of the FSB who is now in jail.

2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:08.320
 There's a interesting details, especially, uh, coming out recently around the war in

2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:09.320
 Ukraine.

2:13:09.320 --> 2:13:14.760
 So let me actually ask about the war in Ukraine.

2:13:14.760 --> 2:13:21.120
 What is your analysis of the war in Ukraine from 2014 to the full on invasion of Ukraine

2:13:21.120 --> 2:13:27.440
 by Russia in 2022 in February, 2022?

2:13:27.440 --> 2:13:33.040
 But um, there's many questions we could ask.

2:13:33.040 --> 2:13:37.800
 One is, what are the sins of the governments involved?

2:13:37.800 --> 2:13:45.920
 What are the sins of Russia, Ukraine, America, China?

2:13:45.920 --> 2:13:48.320
 Are those sins comparable?

2:13:48.320 --> 2:13:49.800
 Who are the good guys and the bad guys?

2:13:49.800 --> 2:13:52.240
 That was more than one question.

2:13:52.240 --> 2:14:01.880
 Let me just, uh, uh, give you my, the basics about this savvy observers saw this coming.

2:14:01.880 --> 2:14:09.000
 There were very small minority, uh, because Vladimir Putin was pretty open about what

2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:15.960
 he told the world his mission was, was the reestablishment of a strong Russia, the reestablishment

2:14:15.960 --> 2:14:22.160
 of something like the, the Russian empire to unite all the Russian speaking, uh, uh,

2:14:22.160 --> 2:14:27.280
 people, uh, in, under one country and, uh, the world ignored him.

2:14:27.280 --> 2:14:32.240
 I mean, he was open, uh, what was, was at a, at a conference in, in, in, in France,

2:14:32.240 --> 2:14:38.600
 I believe when we, we set this out, out in the open, uh, and then what we had, uh, in

2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:44.960
 the United States, we had wishful, wishful thinking, you know, Obama had this reset with

2:14:44.960 --> 2:14:48.640
 Russia, you know, we all get friendly.

2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:54.960
 And then when, when, uh, uh, Putin invaded, uh, Crimea, we did nothing.

2:14:54.960 --> 2:15:03.440
 So and it, and it just escalated slowly, but surely it was pretty clear.

2:15:03.440 --> 2:15:08.400
 And then they said, uh, it was, I think two years ago, there was an essay published by,

2:15:08.400 --> 2:15:12.880
 uh, Putin, whether he wrote it or not, it doesn't matter, but that was also out in public

2:15:12.880 --> 2:15:15.840
 where he was, again, quite clear what he was going to do.

2:15:15.840 --> 2:15:20.520
 Now how do you do this with force?

2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:26.160
 And, uh, and the, the sins committed by the American government was that we ignored it.

2:15:26.160 --> 2:15:32.680
 We weren't engaged in wishful thinking and we didn't stop it with sanctions before the

2:15:32.680 --> 2:15:34.040
 shooting started.

2:15:34.040 --> 2:15:40.440
 To push back, I don't think you're fully describing, you are describing the sins of the Russian

2:15:40.440 --> 2:15:42.320
 government and Putin.

2:15:42.320 --> 2:15:46.440
 I don't think you're fully describing the sins of the American government here because

2:15:46.440 --> 2:15:51.580
 not only didn't, you're doing, you're describing the miscalculation.

2:15:51.580 --> 2:15:58.200
 So not only did they not pressure correctly with sanctions and so on and, and, and clearly

2:15:58.200 --> 2:16:02.280
 respond to the actual statements and the essays and the words spoken.

2:16:02.280 --> 2:16:04.080
 I know where you're going, but keep on speaking.

2:16:04.080 --> 2:16:05.080
 Yes.

2:16:05.080 --> 2:16:13.080
 But they also, at the same time, pressured, pressured Russia and they also, as, as Putin

2:16:13.080 --> 2:16:19.600
 himself said, sort of, there's a rat and they pushed the rat towards the corner by expanding

2:16:19.600 --> 2:16:31.320
 NATO and, uh, and arming Ukraine and the military industrial complex is a machine that, uh,

2:16:31.320 --> 2:16:39.400
 that led us, um, and I think a lot of younger people, I mean, when I came to this country

2:16:39.400 --> 2:16:48.680
 and this is the country I love, I lived through 9 11, I lived through the full roller coaster

2:16:48.680 --> 2:16:49.680
 of emotion.

2:16:49.680 --> 2:16:50.680
 Yeah.

2:16:50.680 --> 2:16:55.880
 I'm a, at that time, before that and after was a proud American.

2:16:55.880 --> 2:17:02.560
 I went through the whole roller coaster of, uh, being sold, uh, I would say a lie about

2:17:02.560 --> 2:17:07.780
 the reason to invade Iraq and even Afghanistan.

2:17:07.780 --> 2:17:14.040
 And I've got to live through understanding of this military industrial complex that leads

2:17:14.040 --> 2:17:22.760
 to the expansion of vampires, of the delusion that we have in the populace, in, in the government

2:17:22.760 --> 2:17:31.800
 that convinces us that we are the good guys and somehow with military force, we can instill

2:17:31.800 --> 2:17:36.160
 our values, instill happiness, the pursuit of happiness that all men are created equal

2:17:36.160 --> 2:17:43.800
 these ideas in, into other lands and we can do so with drones and we can do so with weapons

2:17:43.800 --> 2:17:49.140
 and we could do so without significant cost to our own, from our own pockets.

2:17:49.140 --> 2:17:55.040
 And so this idea, this machine doesn't just apply to Afghanistan and Iraq, it doesn't

2:17:55.040 --> 2:18:00.280
 just apply to Yemen and Syria, it doesn't just apply to China, it also applies to Ukraine.

2:18:00.280 --> 2:18:01.840
 It also applies to Russia.

2:18:01.840 --> 2:18:02.840
 Agreed.

2:18:02.840 --> 2:18:09.680
 Two thoughts, if I may, uh, first of all, when does not hear the term military industrial

2:18:09.680 --> 2:18:16.680
 complex in the public discourse these days, Eisenhower warned about it, Eisenhower was

2:18:16.680 --> 2:18:20.780
 a capitalist, he was the president of the United States.

2:18:20.780 --> 2:18:24.120
 So it exists and it is very powerful.

2:18:24.120 --> 2:18:29.120
 The more weapons you can sell, the more you have to replace them or send over, you have

2:18:29.120 --> 2:18:30.120
 to replace them.

2:18:30.120 --> 2:18:41.580
 So yes, the other thing is there's also a messianic streak that powers American foreign

2:18:41.580 --> 2:18:42.580
 policy.

2:18:42.580 --> 2:18:45.660
 We want to make the world just like us.

2:18:45.660 --> 2:18:47.000
 Why don't they get it?

2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:48.380
 Because they don't want to.

2:18:48.380 --> 2:18:53.520
 It's almost like it's not communism, but it's a, it's a very similar romantic idea that

2:18:53.520 --> 2:18:58.240
 we can make the world then fashion the world the way we are.

2:18:58.240 --> 2:19:04.080
 And that's the romantic side and the sort of honest side, but it doesn't work.

2:19:04.080 --> 2:19:05.320
 It failed every time, right?

2:19:05.320 --> 2:19:11.800
 You know, Afghanistan is a Royal mess and was, would never become a functioning democracy.

2:19:11.800 --> 2:19:16.440
 I don't know if, if Ukraine can become a functioning democracy.

2:19:16.440 --> 2:19:23.040
 So well, I don't know if American weapons can help Ukraine become a functional democracy.

2:19:23.040 --> 2:19:31.680
 I yeah, but there's a huge amount of interest in seeing the world in black and white and

2:19:31.680 --> 2:19:39.560
 selling the story of the world is black and white that Ukraine is the symbol of democracy

2:19:39.560 --> 2:19:42.960
 in this East Eastern European world.

2:19:42.960 --> 2:19:47.480
 And Russia is the symbol of authoritarian dictatorship.

2:19:47.480 --> 2:19:54.080
 And the story is not so simple as, as, as many indices show, Ukraine and Russia are

2:19:54.080 --> 2:19:57.320
 the number one and the number two most corrupt countries in Europe.

2:19:57.320 --> 2:19:59.600
 There are two P's in a pod.

2:19:59.600 --> 2:20:03.440
 One is bigger and one is in this case, the aggressor.

2:20:03.440 --> 2:20:10.760
 Now, you know, two P's, the aggressor is still ultimately responsible.

2:20:10.760 --> 2:20:13.480
 And the person that throws the first punch.

2:20:13.480 --> 2:20:19.040
 Now there's a lot of people going to disagree where the punch came from, but there is, there

2:20:19.040 --> 2:20:28.080
 is magnitude and the struggle by Ukraine for its sovereignty stretches back to the beginning

2:20:28.080 --> 2:20:29.080
 of the 20th century.

2:20:29.080 --> 2:20:31.720
 It stretches back even further than that.

2:20:31.720 --> 2:20:38.000
 But there's been the Ukrainian people are proud people and they've been in many cases

2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:44.200
 tortured by those that sit in the Kremlin throughout the 20th century, the, the, the

2:20:44.200 --> 2:20:46.940
 famine in the, in the early thirties.

2:20:46.940 --> 2:20:51.160
 And it's always, it's never the middle class and upper class that suffer.

2:20:51.160 --> 2:20:59.280
 So is the lower classes, the peasants in that time that this history stretches back far.

2:20:59.280 --> 2:21:02.360
 And this is yet another manifestation of that.

2:21:02.360 --> 2:21:05.920
 And there's a lot of interests at play.

2:21:05.920 --> 2:21:12.360
 China watches closely, Russia, America watches closely.

2:21:12.360 --> 2:21:17.800
 And there's an extra caveat here that there's nuclear weapons at play as well.

2:21:17.800 --> 2:21:18.800
 Exactly.

2:21:18.800 --> 2:21:26.360
 And it's what this is the situation is as dangerous as I have lived through in my entire

2:21:26.360 --> 2:21:28.040
 life, I believe.

2:21:28.040 --> 2:21:33.860
 And because it's not necessarily at the highest point of escalation, but it will be in my

2:21:33.860 --> 2:21:36.840
 view, a protracted crisis.

2:21:36.840 --> 2:21:42.640
 And the longer that crisis lasts, the more of a chance there is of an accident.

2:21:42.640 --> 2:21:43.680
 Yeah.

2:21:43.680 --> 2:21:44.680
 One rocket.

2:21:44.680 --> 2:21:45.680
 Yeah.

2:21:45.680 --> 2:21:51.020
 There's seems to be a strong incentive to prolong, to do siege tactics, to prolong this

2:21:51.020 --> 2:21:57.200
 conflict over perhaps many years, which is terrifying to think about.

2:21:57.200 --> 2:22:05.960
 And over that, a single rocket can lead to, given that there's leaders that might be losing

2:22:05.960 --> 2:22:14.880
 their mind and Ukraine is not part of NATO, the thing I'm really afraid of is that somebody

2:22:14.880 --> 2:22:19.420
 might think it's a good idea for Russia.

2:22:19.420 --> 2:22:25.160
 So Putin might think it's a good idea for Russia to send a message by launching a nuke

2:22:25.160 --> 2:22:28.960
 against Ukraine because they're not part of NATO.

2:22:28.960 --> 2:22:31.560
 So surely the West is not going to respond.

2:22:31.560 --> 2:22:39.440
 What is the West going to do if Russia nukes Ukraine to send a message?

2:22:39.440 --> 2:22:44.880
 I don't know if anyone knows the answer to that question, but it's a terrifying question.

2:22:44.880 --> 2:22:53.840
 And I don't know the exact protocol that needs to be followed to launch a nuclear strike

2:22:53.840 --> 2:22:59.120
 on NATO's end because we have several countries in NATO that have nuclear weapons.

2:22:59.120 --> 2:23:04.760
 So let's say for France to fire a nuke, does the United States have to agree?

2:23:04.760 --> 2:23:05.840
 I don't know how that works.

2:23:05.840 --> 2:23:10.600
 I don't know if anyone knows how that works.

2:23:10.600 --> 2:23:17.680
 I worry, now we have different, very kind of anecdotal perspectives on these things,

2:23:17.680 --> 2:23:23.240
 but the people I've interacted with in the DOD, Department of Defense, in the military,

2:23:23.240 --> 2:23:28.960
 there is a compartmentalization, there is a bureaucracy, and within that giant bureaucracy,

2:23:28.960 --> 2:23:29.960
 there's incompetence.

2:23:29.960 --> 2:23:37.860
 We'd like to think that there is like really well organized for really important things.

2:23:37.860 --> 2:23:42.720
 There's going to be the best of the best in the world that's going to execute on the correct

2:23:42.720 --> 2:23:46.880
 decisions both geopolitically, militarily, all that kind of stuff.

2:23:46.880 --> 2:23:53.200
 And I've seen enough to know that competence at any level of government, at any level in

2:23:53.200 --> 2:23:54.720
 the military is not guaranteed.

2:23:54.720 --> 2:23:57.920
 Let's go back to the law of hierarchy.

2:23:57.920 --> 2:24:01.680
 The government is the biggest hierarchy there is.

2:24:01.680 --> 2:24:06.280
 And so invariably, politicians find their way to the top.

2:24:06.280 --> 2:24:17.800
 And once you have politics dictating substantive decisions, they're going to be weak or wrong.

2:24:17.800 --> 2:24:20.840
 I don't know how this could work any other way.

2:24:20.840 --> 2:24:26.720
 Right now we have some functional idiots in the central United States government.

2:24:26.720 --> 2:24:33.960
 Well, let me, because you said that, I think elsewhere you said that Putin was not a good

2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:34.960
 KGB agent.

2:24:34.960 --> 2:24:35.960
 That's right.

2:24:35.960 --> 2:24:39.200
 A mediocre one, but is an excellent politician.

2:24:39.200 --> 2:24:40.200
 Yeah.

2:24:40.200 --> 2:24:41.200
 And a good organizer.

2:24:41.200 --> 2:24:43.640
 He was known as a really, really good organizer.

2:24:43.640 --> 2:24:56.920
 When Yeltsin hired him as prime minister, he cleaned up the mess because under Yeltsin,

2:24:56.920 --> 2:25:03.800
 Russia deteriorated tremendously and it became sort of a mix of an oligarchy and a criminal

2:25:03.800 --> 2:25:06.760
 enterprise and chaotic.

2:25:06.760 --> 2:25:09.160
 So he had skills that made him a good executive.

2:25:09.160 --> 2:25:10.160
 Absolutely.

2:25:10.160 --> 2:25:12.560
 Now let's go back to him as a KGB agent.

2:25:12.560 --> 2:25:14.720
 He was a KGB agent.

2:25:14.720 --> 2:25:20.300
 I mean, according to him, once a KGB agent, always a KGB agent.

2:25:20.300 --> 2:25:25.900
 But 16 years, let's say, something like this.

2:25:25.900 --> 2:25:33.800
 What do you think about, from your experience, now you're maybe the same age as him, approximately

2:25:33.800 --> 2:25:34.800
 the same age as him.

2:25:34.800 --> 2:25:35.800
 He's a little younger.

2:25:35.800 --> 2:25:36.800
 A little younger.

2:25:36.800 --> 2:25:37.800
 Yeah.

2:25:37.800 --> 2:25:44.480
 So what do you think about the KGB experience he had made him the man he is?

2:25:44.480 --> 2:25:51.720
 What aspect of that, from your own experience, how much does that define you, who you are,

2:25:51.720 --> 2:25:56.820
 how you think about the world, how you analyze the geopolitics of the world, how you analyze

2:25:56.820 --> 2:25:58.040
 human nature?

2:25:58.040 --> 2:26:00.000
 Now I got to tell you one thing.

2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:01.920
 He had a different type of training than I did.

2:26:01.920 --> 2:26:06.840
 Mine was one on one and he went to school, so to speak.

2:26:06.840 --> 2:26:07.840
 So...

2:26:07.840 --> 2:26:08.840
 Classroom training.

2:26:08.840 --> 2:26:09.840
 Right.

2:26:09.840 --> 2:26:18.200
 But fundamentally, he was not a top agent.

2:26:18.200 --> 2:26:21.960
 This is very simple to... There's only one thing you need to know.

2:26:21.960 --> 2:26:24.720
 He knows German pretty well.

2:26:24.720 --> 2:26:27.240
 So where was he deployed?

2:26:27.240 --> 2:26:28.920
 In East Germany.

2:26:28.920 --> 2:26:31.160
 Not in West Germany, not in Switzerland, not in Austria.

2:26:31.160 --> 2:26:35.800
 That's where they sent the best, right, one would think, generally.

2:26:35.800 --> 2:26:37.360
 We're learning here.

2:26:37.360 --> 2:26:41.360
 So this is your classification of where they send the best.

2:26:41.360 --> 2:26:45.400
 People classify all kinds of stuff, like what is the best university in the world?

2:26:45.400 --> 2:26:47.780
 What is the best football team in the world?

2:26:47.780 --> 2:26:53.720
 You start to get a sense, the good guys get sent, the best athletes get sent to... Well,

2:26:53.720 --> 2:26:58.200
 we disagree on this, but the football team is... But you have a sense and you're saying

2:26:58.200 --> 2:27:00.240
 that the best agents would have been sent to West Germany.

2:27:00.240 --> 2:27:01.240
 One would think so.

2:27:01.240 --> 2:27:08.720
 So this is not a forcing argument, but I also have it from a word from the horse's mouth.

2:27:08.720 --> 2:27:10.520
 Which horse?

2:27:10.520 --> 2:27:13.280
 I mean, what kind of horse?

2:27:13.280 --> 2:27:14.280
 What's the breed of the horse?

2:27:14.280 --> 2:27:15.720
 Oleg Kalugin.

2:27:15.720 --> 2:27:17.680
 You know who Oleg Kalugin is.

2:27:17.680 --> 2:27:18.840
 He's still alive.

2:27:18.840 --> 2:27:25.960
 He was, at one point, the head of counterintelligence for the first directorate, espionage, right?

2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:31.000
 And Putin was in the first directorate and reported to Kalugin for a while.

2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:39.240
 And Oleg told me, to my face, that Oleg was not an impressive agent trainee or agent.

2:27:39.240 --> 2:27:41.220
 That Vladimir Putin was not impressive.

2:27:41.220 --> 2:27:42.520
 Not impressive at all.

2:27:42.520 --> 2:27:47.720
 Now he's biased, given this current situation.

2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:53.240
 Well yeah, he could still make it up because he had this big ruckus when he was in parliament

2:27:53.240 --> 2:27:58.320
 and called Putin a war criminal about the war in Serbia.

2:27:58.320 --> 2:28:03.000
 Not only could he make it up, I wouldn't trust his analysis.

2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:08.460
 I mean, I have to, you know, when people, I've been working very hard even before this

2:28:08.460 --> 2:28:12.200
 war to try to understand objective analysis of all the parties involved.

2:28:12.200 --> 2:28:17.480
 You have to really keep an open mind here to see clearly, to understand if you are to

2:28:17.480 --> 2:28:24.800
 try to help in some way make a better world.

2:28:24.800 --> 2:28:32.000
 In this case, stop this war or have all the countries involved flourish, bring out the

2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:36.860
 best of the people, remove the corruption and the greed and the destructive aspects

2:28:36.860 --> 2:28:39.240
 of the governments and let the people flourish.

2:28:39.240 --> 2:28:48.440
 For all of that, you have to put all the biases aside, all the political bickering, all the,

2:28:48.440 --> 2:28:53.600
 I don't know, all the biased analysis.

2:28:53.600 --> 2:29:02.600
 And there's a lot of propaganda that says that, in fact, Putin was a good agent.

2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:05.560
 How else would he rise through the ranks, right?

2:29:05.560 --> 2:29:14.520
 Because he was a good politician and he made a lot of good connections within the KGB.

2:29:14.520 --> 2:29:16.680
 Allow me to say something here.

2:29:16.680 --> 2:29:23.800
 You just taught me a lesson and the lesson I should have figured out myself because I

2:29:23.800 --> 2:29:30.380
 keep on telling people that in the intelligence world, you never know the truth 100%.

2:29:30.380 --> 2:29:34.140
 So when you said, oh, I could make that up, of course you could have.

2:29:34.140 --> 2:29:39.720
 But you get to a point where you're forced to make a decision or have an opinion and

2:29:39.720 --> 2:29:43.880
 then you use your best educated guess.

2:29:43.880 --> 2:29:49.880
 So I'm gonna take the certainty of the statement that I made back because it's quite possible

2:29:49.880 --> 2:29:50.880
 that you're right.

2:29:50.880 --> 2:29:55.120
 Well, what I've noticed about Vladimir Putin, and this is true about, for example, Donald

2:29:55.120 --> 2:30:02.640
 Trump and all those kinds of divisive figures, that for some reason people's opinion on the

2:30:02.640 --> 2:30:05.960
 details of those people are very sticky.

2:30:05.960 --> 2:30:12.300
 Once you decide this is a bad guy, there's like a black hole and people are not able

2:30:12.300 --> 2:30:15.640
 to think one act at a time.

2:30:15.640 --> 2:30:23.760
 You don't have to, that doesn't somehow justify this, this somehow doesn't remove all the

2:30:23.760 --> 2:30:27.240
 evil things that are done, but you can analyze clearly each of the actions.

2:30:27.240 --> 2:30:33.000
 And to me, it is interesting to see how did this man rise through the ranks.

2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:40.200
 Now you're saying that to be a KGB agent, there's a lot of skills involved.

2:30:40.200 --> 2:30:51.400
 Perhaps raw technical skill of spycraft is perhaps not related to the skill of rising

2:30:51.400 --> 2:30:53.720
 through the ranks.

2:30:53.720 --> 2:30:56.760
 And you're saying as a politician, he was good at rising through the ranks.

2:30:56.760 --> 2:31:05.200
 Lying and influencing, that is something that is significant as a significant talent and

2:31:05.200 --> 2:31:11.440
 ability that an agent must have, that helps you as a politician.

2:31:11.440 --> 2:31:20.480
 Continuing the kind of thread of the role of KGB in defining the heart, soul, and mind

2:31:20.480 --> 2:31:27.200
 of Vladimir Putin, let me return to Yuri Bismenov, who was a Soviet KGB agent that wrote a four

2:31:27.200 --> 2:31:33.280
 step framework for ideological subversion on a national scale as practiced by the Soviet

2:31:33.280 --> 2:31:34.280
 Union.

2:31:34.280 --> 2:31:40.920
 And the four steps are demoralization, destabilization, crisis, and normalization.

2:31:40.920 --> 2:31:46.340
 He had a lot of other kind of systematic ways of describing this kind of stuff.

2:31:46.340 --> 2:31:55.280
 So can you speak to some of these ideas about the systematic large scale ideological subversion

2:31:55.280 --> 2:31:56.680
 goals of the KGB?

2:31:56.680 --> 2:32:00.040
 Is there truth to that kind of those ideas?

2:32:00.040 --> 2:32:08.280
 Yes, but I think I already sort of mentioned that I think Bismenov was a fraud.

2:32:08.280 --> 2:32:15.160
 And I have, again, good arguments, let's put it this way.

2:32:15.160 --> 2:32:24.760
 First of all, we know that the KGB was involved in active measures, which is...

2:32:24.760 --> 2:32:29.240
 You can call it fake news.

2:32:29.240 --> 2:32:36.080
 Putting fake news into the countries that are your adversaries.

2:32:36.080 --> 2:32:42.020
 And the Russians have been doing this lately by meddling in our election and focusing

2:32:42.020 --> 2:32:48.280
 on the left and the right fringe and influencing them to become more left and more right.

2:32:48.280 --> 2:32:57.360
 And Vasily Mitrokhin has in one of his books, he has a whole chapter about active measures.

2:32:57.360 --> 2:33:03.040
 Okay, so what he has to say about the department, and I forgot what department that was, was

2:33:03.040 --> 2:33:07.600
 the one department that was the least desirable for KGB agents.

2:33:07.600 --> 2:33:15.580
 Because these were desk jobs for people who had to come up with fake stories in countries

2:33:15.580 --> 2:33:20.360
 where they didn't quite know too much about the country.

2:33:20.360 --> 2:33:27.360
 Now there were some successes, like one of the two most famous successes that I'm aware

2:33:27.360 --> 2:33:37.520
 of is that the AIDS virus was concocted in a CIA lab, and a lot of people around the

2:33:37.520 --> 2:33:39.080
 world believe that.

2:33:39.080 --> 2:33:47.760
 And the other one was that J. Edgar Hoover was a secret cross dresser.

2:33:47.760 --> 2:33:52.000
 That is still known by a lot of Americans who are of a certain age that this was the

2:33:52.000 --> 2:33:53.000
 truth.

2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:59.440
 But Mitrokhin actually traces it back to a story that was placed in a sort of left wing

2:33:59.440 --> 2:34:10.960
 but close to mainstream French magazine, and it was then taken up by larger newspapers

2:34:10.960 --> 2:34:13.900
 and well established papers.

2:34:13.900 --> 2:34:23.680
 So they had some successes, but this kind of a massive, well thought out campaign to

2:34:23.680 --> 2:34:31.240
 destabilize the United States, I don't believe the KGB was capable of doing that.

2:34:31.240 --> 2:34:33.520
 Mitrokhin seems to agree with me.

2:34:33.520 --> 2:34:40.040
 I was trained, I would think, I was one of the crown jewels of their agents.

2:34:40.040 --> 2:34:47.200
 One would think that they used the best that they had to help me how to become an American,

2:34:47.200 --> 2:34:50.080
 and they didn't have a clue.

2:34:50.080 --> 2:34:55.300
 If you don't know how a country operates, how do you come up with this kind of a very

2:34:55.300 --> 2:35:02.920
 detailed long term plan that's also timed, two years this and one year that and all that?

2:35:02.920 --> 2:35:06.720
 Yeah, so we should actually just clarify.

2:35:06.720 --> 2:35:18.400
 He has this whole idea that there's 15 to 20 years needed for demoralization where you're

2:35:18.400 --> 2:35:23.600
 basically infiltrating a country or people from a young age, manipulating their mind.

2:35:23.600 --> 2:35:27.840
 You're destabilizing them, that's the second step that takes two to five years.

2:35:27.840 --> 2:35:31.480
 You target the country's foreign relations, defense and economy.

2:35:31.480 --> 2:35:36.880
 You create a crisis artificially and then you normalize it as if it always was this

2:35:36.880 --> 2:35:37.880
 way.

2:35:37.880 --> 2:35:48.720
 So it's basically saying that the KGB is capable of, at scale, over many years, manipulate

2:35:48.720 --> 2:35:52.080
 an entire population of people.

2:35:52.080 --> 2:35:59.720
 And this is kind of, there's a lot of people that believe in conspiracy theories that are

2:35:59.720 --> 2:36:01.920
 amenable to this kind of idea.

2:36:01.920 --> 2:36:08.600
 Now, my own experience is that there is, in fact, just a giant amount of incompetence

2:36:08.600 --> 2:36:19.080
 and that this is something that's actually very difficult to pull off because it's incredibly

2:36:19.080 --> 2:36:21.280
 difficult to achieve this kind of manipulation.

2:36:21.280 --> 2:36:29.280
 I think it would require, first of all, not much bureaucracy, not much slowing down.

2:36:29.280 --> 2:36:33.500
 You have to have incredible, in the modern world, digital systems that are able to do

2:36:33.500 --> 2:36:36.320
 surveillance, manipulation.

2:36:36.320 --> 2:36:42.360
 There has to be a strategy that is carried out in secrecy across a huge number of people

2:36:42.360 --> 2:36:48.240
 effectively that also requires you hire the best people in the world.

2:36:48.240 --> 2:36:57.000
 And I think it's difficult to execute on this kind of thing if you compartmentalize because

2:36:57.000 --> 2:36:59.400
 there has to be great collaboration.

2:36:59.400 --> 2:37:07.560
 There has to be a great, where there's a unified vision and coordination across multiple groups.

2:37:07.560 --> 2:37:11.240
 There has to be, I mean, it's very difficult to do.

2:37:11.240 --> 2:37:15.880
 Now, nevertheless, especially with technology, this becomes easier and easier.

2:37:15.880 --> 2:37:17.960
 So the bar goes lower and lower.

2:37:17.960 --> 2:37:22.920
 To achieve mass surveillance becomes easier and easier and easier.

2:37:22.920 --> 2:37:28.080
 Mass manipulation through platforms, because we're now digitally connected, you can now

2:37:28.080 --> 2:37:29.260
 do that kind of manipulation.

2:37:29.260 --> 2:37:32.040
 So it becomes more and more realistic that you could do this kind of thing.

2:37:32.040 --> 2:37:39.640
 But you're saying that, no, intelligence, first of all, intelligence is hard.

2:37:39.640 --> 2:37:47.520
 And to do it at scale and to do it well and to do it in a way that it's also not just

2:37:47.520 --> 2:37:51.600
 collecting information about the populace, but manipulating the populace is very, very

2:37:51.600 --> 2:37:52.600
 difficult.

2:37:52.600 --> 2:37:57.440
 Now, let me give you another argument why I think that Besminov was a fraud.

2:37:57.440 --> 2:38:05.720
 I mean, I already have, I have Matrokin on my side and my personal observation of the

2:38:05.720 --> 2:38:08.640
 incompetence that I witnessed.

2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:12.640
 I mean, they really, really didn't know what they didn't know.

2:38:12.640 --> 2:38:17.240
 So now Besminov was KGB, where was he stationed?

2:38:17.240 --> 2:38:19.760
 In India.

2:38:19.760 --> 2:38:25.040
 He was a low level agent in India.

2:38:25.040 --> 2:38:30.800
 And I told you it was the one thing that the KGB was really good at was compartmentalization.

2:38:30.800 --> 2:38:36.520
 How does Besminov in India find out about this massive plan that should have been super

2:38:36.520 --> 2:38:38.000
 secret, right?

2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:40.920
 He made it up, sorry.

2:38:40.920 --> 2:38:42.520
 And you know why he got away with it?

2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:45.460
 Because Americans eat that up, because it's not our fault.

2:38:45.460 --> 2:38:49.200
 It's the damn Russians that doing all that bad stuff.

2:38:49.200 --> 2:38:54.060
 Speaking of the damn Russians doing all that bad stuff, you know about the Internet Research

2:38:54.060 --> 2:38:55.920
 Agency.

2:38:55.920 --> 2:39:04.880
 They have been doing quite a bit of damage and I'm now familiar with the world of enhanced

2:39:04.880 --> 2:39:06.800
 artificial persons.

2:39:06.800 --> 2:39:15.200
 These are the avatars on Facebook and Twitter and so forth that look like real people.

2:39:15.200 --> 2:39:18.800
 And there are quite a few of them.

2:39:18.800 --> 2:39:26.360
 And I have a good friend who operates in that realm and he uses, for instance, facial recognition

2:39:26.360 --> 2:39:36.040
 when he thinks that there's a suspicious character, say, on LinkedIn or on Facebook.

2:39:36.040 --> 2:39:42.440
 And very often he finds out, yeah, that that person exists, but it's not the person who

2:39:42.440 --> 2:39:44.120
 it pretends to be.

2:39:44.120 --> 2:39:48.280
 So basically detecting the artificial, the enhanced artificial person.

2:39:48.280 --> 2:39:50.360
 But he can also make them.

2:39:50.360 --> 2:39:53.760
 You think the United States doesn't do it?

2:39:53.760 --> 2:39:54.760
 We do it too.

2:39:54.760 --> 2:39:57.760
 Well, this is to push back against your pushback, right?

2:39:57.760 --> 2:40:04.320
 Yeah, Bezmenov might be a fraud, but is it possible, especially in the modern age, that

2:40:04.320 --> 2:40:08.440
 there is these kind of large scale systematic operatives?

2:40:08.440 --> 2:40:22.360
 Wouldn't you, as a government that's investing billions of dollars into military equipment,

2:40:22.360 --> 2:40:31.120
 in a world that's more and more clearly going to be defined by cyber war versus hot war,

2:40:31.120 --> 2:40:37.840
 wouldn't you start to have serious meetings, large amounts of hires that are working at

2:40:37.840 --> 2:40:44.040
 how do we manipulate the information flow, how do we manipulate the minds of the populace,

2:40:44.040 --> 2:40:46.680
 how do we sell them a narrative?

2:40:46.680 --> 2:40:52.240
 So even though he might have been making up a story because people eat it up, could it

2:40:52.240 --> 2:40:59.120
 speak to some deep truth that's actually different than the truth you came up in as a KGB agent?

2:40:59.120 --> 2:41:00.120
 I agree with you 100%.

2:41:00.120 --> 2:41:08.680
 It's much easier when all you need is an army of nerds who also know.

2:41:08.680 --> 2:41:09.940
 No offense to nerds.

2:41:09.940 --> 2:41:11.600
 That's a term of endearment I use.

2:41:11.600 --> 2:41:14.600
 Yes, I love nerds.

2:41:14.600 --> 2:41:16.960
 I used to be one myself, but anyway.

2:41:16.960 --> 2:41:21.020
 Once a nerd, always a nerd.

2:41:21.020 --> 2:41:23.000
 So what I was going to say here is.

2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:25.600
 All you need is an army of nerds.

2:41:25.600 --> 2:41:32.240
 And what also experts in the culture of the target country.

2:41:32.240 --> 2:41:33.240
 Okay.

2:41:33.240 --> 2:41:35.400
 And nowadays the world is different.

2:41:35.400 --> 2:41:37.040
 There's a whole lot more fluidity.

2:41:37.040 --> 2:41:40.480
 There's a whole lot of more people that like say Russians, for instance, study in the United

2:41:40.480 --> 2:41:46.560
 States, Chinese, an army of Chinese studying in the United States, they have a lot more

2:41:46.560 --> 2:41:52.660
 knowledge of how we function than the KGB did and it's vice versa.

2:41:52.660 --> 2:41:58.320
 Not as many Americans in Russia, but we have some, but the Chinese and the Russians have

2:41:58.320 --> 2:41:59.320
 an advantage here.

2:41:59.320 --> 2:42:02.700
 Can I ask you a question based on your experience?

2:42:02.700 --> 2:42:13.440
 So I have been talking to a lot of powerful people and some of which have very close connections

2:42:13.440 --> 2:42:19.480
 to in this particular conflict, Ukraine and Russia, but in other places as well.

2:42:19.480 --> 2:42:24.960
 I don't believe I've ever been contacted by or interacted with an intelligence agency.

2:42:24.960 --> 2:42:34.400
 CIA, FSB, MI6, Mossad, I don't think I had, well, let me say explicitly, I haven't had

2:42:34.400 --> 2:42:38.580
 an official conversation, which is what I assume I would have because I have nothing

2:42:38.580 --> 2:42:39.580
 to hide.

2:42:39.580 --> 2:42:40.580
 Right?

2:42:40.580 --> 2:42:43.820
 So I think there's no reason for people to be secretive.

2:42:43.820 --> 2:42:52.000
 But would I, why is that, would I know, am I interesting at all, how are people determined

2:42:52.000 --> 2:42:54.560
 if they're a person of interest or not?

2:42:54.560 --> 2:43:00.200
 And I guess the question, I mean, some of it I ask in a bit of a humorous way, but also

2:43:00.200 --> 2:43:02.960
 perhaps there's truth in some of the humors.

2:43:02.960 --> 2:43:10.400
 Would I know if I have ever interacted with a intelligence agency spy?

2:43:10.400 --> 2:43:20.000
 Well, you don't know that you haven't been contacted, but certainly not, I think you

2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:24.640
 never had a conversation that related to intelligence in any way, shape, or form, right?

2:43:24.640 --> 2:43:25.640
 Right.

2:43:25.640 --> 2:43:27.520
 Like where a person, another person introduced themselves.

2:43:27.520 --> 2:43:28.520
 Yeah.

2:43:28.520 --> 2:43:34.620
 Introduced themselves or becomes, sort of wants to be your friend and then talks about

2:43:34.620 --> 2:43:37.120
 these types of topics, right?

2:43:37.120 --> 2:43:38.120
 Yeah.

2:43:38.120 --> 2:43:48.840
 I, there's people because of who I'm interacting with, they're, I mean, even with just, even

2:43:48.840 --> 2:43:57.080
 with Elon Musk, like if you think about Elon Musk, there's a lot of people that are, that

2:43:57.080 --> 2:43:59.780
 are part of the conversations that happen.

2:43:59.780 --> 2:44:01.600
 How do I know they're all trustworthy?

2:44:01.600 --> 2:44:03.400
 They all present themselves as trustworthy.

2:44:03.400 --> 2:44:07.560
 Now, again, I have nothing, so this is, this is for the intelligence agencies.

2:44:07.560 --> 2:44:08.560
 I have nothing to hide.

2:44:08.560 --> 2:44:16.560
 I am the same person privately as publicly, well intentioned, real, no, no controlled,

2:44:16.560 --> 2:44:20.400
 no weird sexual stuff where you can manipulate me.

2:44:20.400 --> 2:44:21.400
 What else?

2:44:21.400 --> 2:44:22.400
 No drug use.

2:44:22.400 --> 2:44:28.240
 No drug use, no, no skeletons in the closet, none of that kind of stuff.

2:44:28.240 --> 2:44:33.560
 But you know, I don't, I don't know, I mean, just even having these conversations, you

2:44:33.560 --> 2:44:36.440
 know, I tend to trust people as a default.

2:44:36.440 --> 2:44:38.080
 Yeah, me too.

2:44:38.080 --> 2:44:45.120
 And you start when you think, well, especially with some of the people I've been talking

2:44:45.120 --> 2:44:52.080
 with and some of the traveling I'm doing, I'm realizing there's a, you know, there's

2:44:52.080 --> 2:45:01.080
 hard men in this world, there's military, there's serious suffering and there's war

2:45:01.080 --> 2:45:06.600
 and there's serious people that are doing serious harm and so you have to be careful

2:45:06.600 --> 2:45:09.920
 of thinking who to trust.

2:45:09.920 --> 2:45:14.720
 The person approaches you with a smile and asks you a question.

2:45:14.720 --> 2:45:20.120
 My natural inclination is that person is a cool person, I'll answer the question, become

2:45:20.120 --> 2:45:21.120
 a friend.

2:45:21.120 --> 2:45:26.640
 But it becomes difficult when you realize that there's things like intelligence agencies

2:45:26.640 --> 2:45:28.880
 with thousands of employees.

2:45:28.880 --> 2:45:33.580
 There's people that are doing major military actions that involve tens of thousands, hundreds

2:45:33.580 --> 2:45:35.460
 of thousands of soldiers.

2:45:35.460 --> 2:45:39.920
 This is serious stuff and so how do I, how do you know how to operate in this world?

2:45:39.920 --> 2:45:47.040
 The folks that you're interacting with have a responsibility not to tell you what they

2:45:47.040 --> 2:45:49.000
 shouldn't tell you, right?

2:45:49.000 --> 2:45:54.080
 So and most of them probably won't and I'm guessing occasionally they will say, well,

2:45:54.080 --> 2:45:57.320
 I can't go there, right?

2:45:57.320 --> 2:46:08.320
 So what you are aware of is sort of public and what you're doing is you're collecting

2:46:08.320 --> 2:46:21.200
 it and you're editing it to some extent, you're not changing the verbage, you just repeat

2:46:21.200 --> 2:46:27.560
 what they say, so from that angle you're not privy to any real secrets.

2:46:27.560 --> 2:46:36.360
 What you have possibly that could be of use is you learn to get to know the person.

2:46:36.360 --> 2:46:43.680
 So I'm thinking there's a good possibility if you get the interviews in the East that

2:46:43.680 --> 2:46:47.520
 somebody may actually approach you and ask you what's your opinion.

2:46:47.520 --> 2:46:51.320
 I just hope they approach me and introduce themselves properly.

2:46:51.320 --> 2:46:59.000
 I just, there's a kind of, I mean, would you know, like how many Russian spies are there

2:46:59.000 --> 2:47:00.040
 in the United States?

2:47:00.040 --> 2:47:02.480
 How many American spies are there in Russia?

2:47:02.480 --> 2:47:03.680
 Do you have a sense?

2:47:03.680 --> 2:47:06.240
 Is it just like with the GRU?

2:47:06.240 --> 2:47:07.960
 No idea.

2:47:07.960 --> 2:47:13.560
 Is it possible there's like tens of thousands and we're not, or like thousands?

2:47:13.560 --> 2:47:16.160
 Not thousands like I used to operate.

2:47:16.160 --> 2:47:22.520
 We are too hard to train and we weren't that successful to begin with, but particularly

2:47:22.520 --> 2:47:34.000
 Russians and Chinese, both governments know who is going abroad and I guarantee you there's

2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:40.640
 a lot of amateur spies, they're being asked to help us out, do something for the motherland.

2:47:40.640 --> 2:47:42.080
 And crowdsource spying.

2:47:42.080 --> 2:47:43.720
 Yeah, sort of.

2:47:43.720 --> 2:47:46.000
 Not serious training, but yeah.

2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:52.840
 For instance, this lady, I forgot her first name, Butina, she was a rank amateur.

2:47:52.840 --> 2:47:57.840
 She used social media to communicate with Moscow.

2:47:57.840 --> 2:48:01.360
 She had no training, but she was reasonably successful.

2:48:01.360 --> 2:48:11.720
 I mean, and the difference between, let's say, the current Russian intelligence and

2:48:11.720 --> 2:48:22.080
 the KGB, Vladimir Putin and his henchmen are okay with people being caught because, and

2:48:22.080 --> 2:48:28.400
 every time I go and talk and give a talk someplace, I'm always asked this question, how many Russian

2:48:28.400 --> 2:48:31.260
 spies do you think we have here?

2:48:31.260 --> 2:48:33.520
 Because that scares the people, right?

2:48:33.520 --> 2:48:35.540
 And Putin likes to scare people.

2:48:35.540 --> 2:48:40.960
 The KGB was very solicitous of their agents.

2:48:40.960 --> 2:48:43.640
 They didn't want any one of them caught, all right?

2:48:43.640 --> 2:48:47.280
 So that's a big difference.

2:48:47.280 --> 2:48:52.160
 So for the FSB, getting caught sends a strong signal to the world that there's agents everywhere.

2:48:52.160 --> 2:48:53.820
 Yeah, there could be many more.

2:48:53.820 --> 2:49:03.560
 And there probably are, but because also the world, again, there's a whole lot more travel

2:49:03.560 --> 2:49:09.200
 going on, a whole lot more interaction, studying abroad, doing business.

2:49:09.200 --> 2:49:16.160
 And there will be attempted espionage probably every minute in this country.

2:49:16.160 --> 2:49:20.560
 That doesn't mean they will be successful, no.

2:49:20.560 --> 2:49:27.120
 But there is a cottage industry now that is doing quite well that teaches companies how

2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:37.680
 to fortify themselves against industrial espionage or also foreign actors spying.

2:49:37.680 --> 2:49:38.680
 It's all over the place.

2:49:38.680 --> 2:49:39.680
 Yeah.

2:49:39.680 --> 2:49:44.520
 As it becomes easier and easier with digital, with cyber, that becomes a serious, very serious

2:49:44.520 --> 2:49:45.520
 threat.

2:49:45.520 --> 2:49:51.100
 We might wind up in a world where nobody knows anymore what's up and what's down.

2:49:51.100 --> 2:49:59.280
 If I was to have a conversation with Vladimir Putin and or Vladimir Zelensky, is there something

2:49:59.280 --> 2:50:10.200
 you would ask about the time in the KGB and the time in his past?

2:50:10.200 --> 2:50:16.760
 All of us, men and women, are creations of the experiences we have in our life, early

2:50:16.760 --> 2:50:22.480
 on in life and through the formative experiences, successes and failures.

2:50:22.480 --> 2:50:23.480
 So...

2:50:23.480 --> 2:50:25.000
 Yeah, you just said the key words.

2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:31.280
 I would ask, without giving away anything, just being high level, your biggest success

2:50:31.280 --> 2:50:33.560
 and your biggest failure.

2:50:33.560 --> 2:50:35.520
 As a politician or as a KGB agent?

2:50:35.520 --> 2:50:40.220
 No, we're talking in the realm of KGB.

2:50:40.220 --> 2:50:48.600
 When the wall came down, and he was in an office, a KGB office in the city of Dresden,

2:50:48.600 --> 2:51:01.240
 and East Germans were besieging Stasi offices, and they also dropped by the KGB office, and

2:51:01.240 --> 2:51:02.240
 they were...

2:51:02.240 --> 2:51:03.600
 It was pretty threatening.

2:51:03.600 --> 2:51:09.520
 It looked like they would actually storm the office and get, you know, the documents and

2:51:09.520 --> 2:51:11.440
 stuff like that.

2:51:11.440 --> 2:51:23.920
 And initially, the first demonstration was told that if they come any closer, weapons

2:51:23.920 --> 2:51:24.920
 would be used.

2:51:24.920 --> 2:51:31.040
 So, they disappeared, and then they came back, and I don't know, somebody in that office

2:51:31.040 --> 2:51:35.280
 called Berlin and said, what are we gonna do?

2:51:35.280 --> 2:51:37.440
 Are we allowed to use force?

2:51:37.440 --> 2:51:41.440
 And the answer came back that Gorbachev said, absolutely not.

2:51:41.440 --> 2:51:46.800
 And so, this is where Putin, all of a sudden, you know, he was at one point a member of

2:51:46.800 --> 2:51:51.360
 the greatest, the most powerful intelligence organization in the world, and all of a sudden,

2:51:51.360 --> 2:51:59.960
 he was powerless, and he had to watch how, you know, this was a defeat, big one.

2:51:59.960 --> 2:52:09.400
 It's supposedly a powerful intelligence agency cowering, sort of crawling back into a position

2:52:09.400 --> 2:52:10.400
 of weakness.

2:52:10.400 --> 2:52:15.440
 And he probably promised himself, never again, Russia needs to be great again.

2:52:15.440 --> 2:52:23.400
 The KGB, FSB, Russia, the Russian Empire needs to rise again, and that there's a feeling

2:52:23.400 --> 2:52:28.320
 for him that that's, as he talks about the collapse of the Soviet Union being a great

2:52:28.320 --> 2:52:38.080
 tragedy, there's a feeling like that was, like, never again.

2:52:38.080 --> 2:52:49.200
 Yeah, and I believe that he has a strong conviction that, I don't know if he's religious, he

2:52:49.200 --> 2:52:55.840
 carries the cross now, but I don't know what that means, but somehow, but that it's the

2:52:55.840 --> 2:53:03.760
 destiny of the Russian nation to be great, and that is sort of, whether it's determined

2:53:03.760 --> 2:53:08.480
 by God or some higher power, that is very important for him.

2:53:08.480 --> 2:53:17.640
 Of course, that nationalist idea is one that Americans share as well, and it could help

2:53:17.640 --> 2:53:22.600
 a nation flourish, so by itself, it's not necessarily a bad thing, it's how it manifests

2:53:22.600 --> 2:53:25.240
 itself is the question.

2:53:25.240 --> 2:53:36.840
 One other thing, if I were to get a chat with the Ukrainian president, I would ask him,

2:53:36.840 --> 2:53:46.200
 how many lives, what is the equation between giving up some land and how many lives are

2:53:46.200 --> 2:53:50.120
 worth this land?

2:53:50.120 --> 2:53:54.080
 And that's a good way to phrase the question, of course, that question gets you killed in

2:53:54.080 --> 2:54:01.200
 Ukraine, but because there's another part of that equation, which is it's not just land

2:54:01.200 --> 2:54:10.660
 versus lives, it's the sovereignty, the knowledge that you're free and you're self determined,

2:54:10.660 --> 2:54:21.080
 and it's not about fighting for the particular land, it's saying we are messed up, corrupt,

2:54:21.080 --> 2:54:27.120
 we have problems, it's a messy world, but it's our world.

2:54:27.120 --> 2:54:35.320
 I think Stephen Crane has a poem about a man eating his own heart, and he was asked how

2:54:35.320 --> 2:54:39.680
 does it taste, and he said it's bitter, but I like it because it is bitter and because

2:54:39.680 --> 2:54:46.000
 it is my heart, and that there's a sense of I want, this is not just about land, this

2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:47.800
 is our nation.

2:54:47.800 --> 2:54:53.760
 The same love of nation that Putin has for Russia, the greater Russia, this vision of

2:54:53.760 --> 2:54:58.760
 this great empire, I believe Ukraine does as well.

2:54:58.760 --> 2:55:04.400
 Not every nation, there's levels to this game, and Ukrainian people are some of the proudest

2:55:04.400 --> 2:55:10.840
 people throughout the history of the 20th century, throughout the history of Earth.

2:55:10.840 --> 2:55:12.160
 The Polish people are proud people.

2:55:12.160 --> 2:55:20.840
 You can just see in World War II, the people who said fuck you, you're not having this,

2:55:20.840 --> 2:55:23.240
 we will die to the last man.

2:55:23.240 --> 2:55:28.160
 There's different cultures that kind of really hold their ground, and Ukrainian people are

2:55:28.160 --> 2:55:29.160
 that.

2:55:29.160 --> 2:55:33.160
 You know, I have to admit, in that respect, I'm a bit of a coward.

2:55:33.160 --> 2:55:40.560
 I could not do what Zelensky has been doing.

2:55:40.560 --> 2:55:53.840
 I would sort of try to find a way to carve out something that I can live with, however,

2:55:53.840 --> 2:55:58.040
 if that force, that evil force gets to my family.

2:55:58.040 --> 2:55:59.040
 Right.

2:55:59.040 --> 2:56:00.040
 There's lines.

2:56:00.040 --> 2:56:01.040
 Yes.

2:56:01.040 --> 2:56:02.040
 That's right.

2:56:02.040 --> 2:56:09.560
 You become the world's bravest man if somebody crosses that line.

2:56:09.560 --> 2:56:16.840
 You mentioned something about you've not been to Moscow back, and that it might not be safe

2:56:16.840 --> 2:56:18.840
 for you to travel there.

2:56:18.840 --> 2:56:19.840
 Yes.

2:56:19.840 --> 2:56:24.720
 Can you speak to the nature of that?

2:56:24.720 --> 2:56:33.520
 As somebody that successfully got out of the KGB, how are you still alive?

2:56:33.520 --> 2:56:36.100
 A number of reasons.

2:56:36.100 --> 2:56:44.740
 First of all, when my story became public, it was six years ago, I was pretty old, right?

2:56:44.740 --> 2:56:51.240
 And so the folks that may have a personal interest or may have had a personal interest

2:56:51.240 --> 2:56:55.480
 in doing me harm, most of them don't live anymore, all right?

2:56:55.480 --> 2:56:56.480
 That's number one.

2:56:56.480 --> 2:57:02.520
 Number two, I did not, I wasn't, I hired hand, a German.

2:57:02.520 --> 2:57:04.720
 I did not betray the motherland.

2:57:04.720 --> 2:57:09.520
 That's a crime that is punished by death.

2:57:09.520 --> 2:57:17.480
 You betray the motherland.

2:57:17.480 --> 2:57:27.040
 And the other thing is, you know that these kinds of operations to assassination in another

2:57:27.040 --> 2:57:33.160
 country are very difficult to plan and implement, and if there's a list of people that they

2:57:33.160 --> 2:57:36.920
 don't like, I may not be at the very top.

2:57:36.920 --> 2:57:41.900
 Having said that, you know, if I wind up, say, in Moscow or even in countries like Turkey

2:57:41.900 --> 2:57:49.640
 where there's a lot of lawlessness, you know, accidents can easily be arranged, and that's

2:57:49.640 --> 2:57:57.200
 just sending another message, you know, just like, you know, we can do a lot of things.

2:57:57.200 --> 2:57:58.200
 Powerful.

2:57:58.200 --> 2:57:59.200
 Yes.

2:57:59.200 --> 2:58:02.960
 Do you think it's safe for me to travel in Russia and Ukraine?

2:58:02.960 --> 2:58:11.160
 I think you know very well how to communicate in both countries.

2:58:11.160 --> 2:58:18.200
 You know, you've shown this in this interaction that you have a lot of empathy for the people

2:58:18.200 --> 2:58:22.920
 you'll be talking with, and empathy means good understanding where they're coming from,

2:58:22.920 --> 2:58:25.840
 and that there are lines that you can't cross.

2:58:25.840 --> 2:58:29.080
 Like the question that I was going to ask Zelensky, you're not going to ask.

2:58:29.080 --> 2:58:30.080
 Good for you.

2:58:30.080 --> 2:58:33.320
 Yeah, isn't that the funny thing about this world?

2:58:33.320 --> 2:58:34.320
 There's lines.

2:58:34.320 --> 2:58:35.320
 There's lines everywhere.

2:58:35.320 --> 2:58:38.920
 Even in love, even in personal relationships, there's lines you should not cross.

2:58:38.920 --> 2:58:39.920
 Yeah.

2:58:39.920 --> 2:58:42.120
 How did you finally get caught?

2:58:42.120 --> 2:58:45.040
 I resigned in 1988, so...

2:58:45.040 --> 2:58:46.040
 Let's actually talk about that.

2:58:46.040 --> 2:58:47.040
 There was a...

2:58:47.040 --> 2:58:48.040
 Okay, yeah.

2:58:48.040 --> 2:58:49.040
 Resigned.

2:58:49.040 --> 2:58:50.040
 There's warning signs.

2:58:50.040 --> 2:58:51.040
 Yeah, yeah, okay.

2:58:51.040 --> 2:58:52.040
 There's yet another choice.

2:58:52.040 --> 2:58:53.040
 Yet another crossroads.

2:58:53.040 --> 2:58:54.040
 Yes, okay.

2:58:54.040 --> 2:58:55.040
 What was the calculation?

2:58:55.040 --> 2:58:57.600
 What was the choice to be made?

2:58:57.600 --> 2:59:08.600
 To give a little background, it was 1988, and I thought they would...

2:59:08.600 --> 2:59:15.960
 My time in the US would soon end because I thought 10 to 12 years, it was already past

2:59:15.960 --> 2:59:16.960
 10 years.

2:59:16.960 --> 2:59:23.620
 There was no indication that they indicated, that they said, you're done.

2:59:23.620 --> 2:59:30.040
 But in December of 1988, I got this one thing that I never wanted to see.

2:59:30.040 --> 2:59:39.440
 So we had a system of signals that either one of those diplomat agents could set at

2:59:39.440 --> 2:59:47.140
 a spot that I pass by every day, or I could set where they would pass by, like on their

2:59:47.140 --> 2:59:52.240
 way from where they live to the United Nations, for instance, who would just drive.

2:59:52.240 --> 3:00:03.400
 So the signal spot for me was on a support beam for the elevated atrium in Queens.

3:00:03.400 --> 3:00:10.480
 And it was morning in December that I walked by there and routinely look at it, and I never

3:00:10.480 --> 3:00:11.480
 expected anything.

3:00:11.480 --> 3:00:17.640
 And there was this red dot, it was about the size of my fist with a red paint.

3:00:17.640 --> 3:00:24.360
 And since you have done it already, I think I can curse in this moment, because it's the

3:00:24.360 --> 3:00:30.880
 only way I can really indicate how I felt, I said, oh shit, because that was the danger

3:00:30.880 --> 3:00:31.880
 signal.

3:00:31.880 --> 3:00:37.800
 It was like, you are in severe danger, and you need to get out of the country as soon

3:00:37.800 --> 3:00:38.800
 as possible.

3:00:38.800 --> 3:00:44.320
 There was a protocol that I was supposed to follow, I wasn't even supposed to go home,

3:00:44.320 --> 3:00:53.160
 I just needed to, was supposed to get my reserve documents that I had hidden in a park in the

3:00:53.160 --> 3:00:57.960
 Bronx and make a beeline to the Canadian border.

3:00:57.960 --> 3:00:59.480
 I wasn't ready.

3:00:59.480 --> 3:01:05.600
 So I just ignored this thing, I mean, I couldn't ignore it, but I went on to work, got on the

3:01:05.600 --> 3:01:11.240
 A train, went to work, and then went to my cubicle and stared at the computer screen

3:01:11.240 --> 3:01:12.720
 all day because I couldn't think.

3:01:12.720 --> 3:01:15.780
 I could think only about what to do, what to do, what to do.

3:01:15.780 --> 3:01:24.480
 The reason for this indecisiveness was that I was a father at the time.

3:01:24.480 --> 3:01:32.320
 My little girl by the name of Chelsea was 18 months old, and I was there when she was

3:01:32.320 --> 3:01:45.200
 born, I took her to her home, I watched her grow up, I watched her take the first steps,

3:01:45.200 --> 3:01:52.000
 and always look at me with these big eyes, lovingly look at me, and that is when I started

3:01:52.000 --> 3:02:01.400
 my reentry into the human race, because I just fell in love with this girl.

3:02:01.400 --> 3:02:08.720
 That's when love came back, and it was completely unexpected, and there's a lot of fathers who

3:02:08.720 --> 3:02:15.840
 understand, particularly fathers of girls who understand what happened there.

3:02:15.840 --> 3:02:23.300
 I still thought I need to go back because there was probably some danger, but I hadn't

3:02:23.300 --> 3:02:29.840
 figured out how to take care of the girl, leave her, but maybe she needs to have a good

3:02:29.840 --> 3:02:35.760
 life and grow up and have a chance, and her mother, she was from South America, she had

3:02:35.760 --> 3:02:38.320
 a fourth grade education.

3:02:38.320 --> 3:02:41.360
 That would have not worked very well.

3:02:41.360 --> 3:02:45.880
 So I played for time.

3:02:45.880 --> 3:02:51.400
 Obviously I could be sick, I could be in a hospital, there was a precedent where I was

3:02:51.400 --> 3:03:00.200
 sick where I couldn't communicate for about three weeks, so I just did nothing.

3:03:00.200 --> 3:03:07.000
 That was on a Monday, on a Thursday was my regular shortwave transmission, I listened,

3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:11.880
 and they explained a little in a few sentences.

3:03:11.880 --> 3:03:15.160
 We have reason to believe that the FBI is on your case.

3:03:15.160 --> 3:03:22.760
 You need to execute the emergency procedure, come home right away.

3:03:22.760 --> 3:03:28.560
 I still had some time because the radio could be broken or the transmission was bad, or

3:03:28.560 --> 3:03:30.120
 I still could be in a hospital, right?

3:03:30.120 --> 3:03:42.960
 So I gave myself some more time, and then something happened where they forced my hand.

3:03:42.960 --> 3:03:48.160
 And this is the only time that a Soviet agent was anywhere near me on the territory of the

3:03:48.160 --> 3:03:50.000
 United States.

3:03:50.000 --> 3:04:02.120
 So I'm waiting for the A train on a dark morning still in Queens, and there's this man, the

3:04:02.120 --> 3:04:08.120
 short man in a black trench coat comes up to me from my right, and he whispers into

3:04:08.120 --> 3:04:13.120
 my ears, you got to come back or else you're dead.

3:04:13.120 --> 3:04:18.080
 I can't imitate the Russian accent, it was a Russian accent.

3:04:18.080 --> 3:04:20.760
 And it was a pretty strong accent.

3:04:20.760 --> 3:04:28.880
 The you're dead phrase can have two meanings, and an American would have said, or else you're

3:04:28.880 --> 3:04:34.320
 busted or else you get arrested or else you're dead is very strong.

3:04:34.320 --> 3:04:42.640
 So now you have to take it seriously to some degree because I knew that they had a history

3:04:42.640 --> 3:04:46.360
 of assassinating or at least trying to assassinate defectors.

3:04:46.360 --> 3:04:51.920
 So that obviously raised the stakes a little bit.

3:04:51.920 --> 3:04:59.360
 But I just talked myself into believing this was just a bad phrasing.

3:04:59.360 --> 3:05:03.920
 But at this point, I knew and they knew that we both knew, right?

3:05:03.920 --> 3:05:05.080
 So there was no more guessing.

3:05:05.080 --> 3:05:07.980
 He found me, he talked to me, I know.

3:05:07.980 --> 3:05:09.140
 So now I had to act.

3:05:09.140 --> 3:05:18.460
 So in the next radiogram, I was asked to execute a dead drop operation where they would give

3:05:18.460 --> 3:05:23.360
 me money and a passport.

3:05:23.360 --> 3:05:32.380
 And that was in a park on Staten Island, it was a location that I found and I described.

3:05:32.380 --> 3:05:41.640
 And I was always praised for my ability to describe spots that are easy to find.

3:05:41.640 --> 3:05:44.560
 So that was a given.

3:05:44.560 --> 3:05:49.600
 And the only thing that was different for this operation, they scheduled it for the

3:05:49.600 --> 3:05:50.600
 dark.

3:05:50.600 --> 3:05:51.880
 All right.

3:05:51.880 --> 3:05:58.800
 But it was still no problem because it was in a park and a couple of, about a hundred

3:05:58.800 --> 3:06:06.060
 yards in by next to a fallen tree would be hard to miss.

3:06:06.060 --> 3:06:15.360
 So I go to Staten Island and I read the signal that said, I put the container in the drop.

3:06:15.360 --> 3:06:16.360
 That was the protocol.

3:06:16.360 --> 3:06:25.600
 There's a signal that the person who hands over something puts at a spot not too far

3:06:25.600 --> 3:06:27.460
 from the spot itself.

3:06:27.460 --> 3:06:30.040
 That means I would go in and just pick it up.

3:06:30.040 --> 3:06:38.960
 The reason I actually went to pick up this container, because there was money in it.

3:06:38.960 --> 3:06:41.480
 So I didn't have to make a decision yet.

3:06:41.480 --> 3:06:42.480
 Okay.

3:06:42.480 --> 3:06:44.260
 I could throw away the passport.

3:06:44.260 --> 3:06:48.240
 It was like I was still trying to figure out what to do, what to do, what to do.

3:06:48.240 --> 3:06:53.800
 So I get to the spot, I get to the tree and I had a flashlight with me that the park,

3:06:53.800 --> 3:06:56.460
 there was no way in the park.

3:06:56.460 --> 3:07:02.360
 Even during the day though, this park was not, it was more, almost like a little forest.

3:07:02.360 --> 3:07:05.920
 And I don't see the container.

3:07:05.920 --> 3:07:13.880
 It wasn't supposed to be a crushed oil can, pretty sizable, hard to miss.

3:07:13.880 --> 3:07:18.560
 And I do a double take and I look again and I look around and look around a little more,

3:07:18.560 --> 3:07:22.200
 see if they misplaced it, can't find it.

3:07:22.200 --> 3:07:29.000
 That's the only one that one of those operations failed.

3:07:29.000 --> 3:07:33.740
 And that just doesn't make a lot of sense.

3:07:33.740 --> 3:07:41.880
 So when, as I'm walking away from this, like sort of numb emotionally, I said to myself,

3:07:41.880 --> 3:07:42.880
 I'm staying.

3:07:42.880 --> 3:07:43.880
 Yeah.

3:07:43.880 --> 3:07:44.880
 That decision.

3:07:44.880 --> 3:07:50.360
 That kind of signal, some kind of a muse just spoke to you.

3:07:50.360 --> 3:07:53.880
 That decision was made for me.

3:07:53.880 --> 3:07:58.920
 Now, you know that I'm a Christian now and I think that was like, God told me this, you

3:07:58.920 --> 3:07:59.920
 know.

3:07:59.920 --> 3:08:01.920
 But it was certain there.

3:08:01.920 --> 3:08:02.920
 It was right there.

3:08:02.920 --> 3:08:03.920
 That was it.

3:08:03.920 --> 3:08:04.920
 That was it.

3:08:04.920 --> 3:08:05.920
 That was it.

3:08:05.920 --> 3:08:15.400
 And so what I did to, well, first of all, divine intervention helped me to find a good

3:08:15.400 --> 3:08:16.960
 explanation.

3:08:16.960 --> 3:08:25.720
 I sent them my last letter with secret writing, I communicated to them, I said, I wish I could

3:08:25.720 --> 3:08:31.880
 come but I can't because I have contracted HIV AIDS.

3:08:31.880 --> 3:08:37.540
 That was the best lie ever because nobody wanted to have AIDS in their country.

3:08:37.540 --> 3:08:39.840
 Those days it was a death sentence, right?

3:08:39.840 --> 3:08:46.140
 And I knew, we had conversations when I was back in Moscow, how they were snickering about

3:08:46.140 --> 3:08:51.600
 what's going on in the United States, that depraved culture and you see, they're killing

3:08:51.600 --> 3:08:52.600
 each other.

3:08:52.600 --> 3:08:57.680
 And the depraved culture took over your being and how you're sitting.

3:08:57.680 --> 3:09:04.240
 And I was convincing enough, I even traced it back to a girlfriend I had once that I

3:09:04.240 --> 3:09:11.760
 actually reported on that she, I interacted with this lady who had a boyfriend at one

3:09:11.760 --> 3:09:16.920
 point who was a drug addict and she was infected and she infected me.

3:09:16.920 --> 3:09:24.440
 So they believed it, they sent and I asked them to give my dollar savings to my German

3:09:24.440 --> 3:09:26.000
 family.

3:09:26.000 --> 3:09:33.380
 They gave them some but they told my family that I already passed away, that I'm dead.

3:09:33.380 --> 3:09:35.420
 They believed it, 100%.

3:09:35.420 --> 3:09:42.120
 And I guess the agent who took the money took half of it for himself.

3:09:42.120 --> 3:09:43.120
 So that was it.

3:09:43.120 --> 3:09:52.360
 And the next three months I made sure that I wasn't reliably at the same spot and the

3:09:52.360 --> 3:09:53.980
 same timeframe.

3:09:53.980 --> 3:10:01.520
 So I went to work in different paths at different times just to, you know, just as a safety

3:10:01.520 --> 3:10:14.360
 measure so to speak and not huge but, you know, it kept me, allowed me to keep my sanity.

3:10:14.360 --> 3:10:21.160
 And obviously after I sent the letter I threw the shortwave radio in the Hudson River, destroyed

3:10:21.160 --> 3:10:23.280
 the one time paths that I still had.

3:10:23.280 --> 3:10:36.000
 So I was now ready to for a new life and live out my life as an American undiscovered but,

3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:42.600
 you know, starting to work on my version of the American dream.

3:10:42.600 --> 3:10:51.060
 And the first action was, I was telling my wife, the mother of this child, you know,

3:10:51.060 --> 3:10:58.440
 she always wanted to have a house and said, you know what, we should buy a house.

3:10:58.440 --> 3:11:02.720
 And a year later we moved into the suburbs and then I said, we should have another child

3:11:02.720 --> 3:11:04.600
 and we had another child.

3:11:04.600 --> 3:11:09.360
 So and I had a career where I did pretty well.

3:11:09.360 --> 3:11:14.320
 I moved a couple of times, wound up in a McMansion.

3:11:14.320 --> 3:11:19.480
 But before that my second house was actually in Pennsylvania, in rural Pennsylvania.

3:11:19.480 --> 3:11:25.960
 And this is where I was discovered by the FBI.

3:11:25.960 --> 3:11:28.880
 And how did they know about me?

3:11:28.880 --> 3:11:36.240
 If it hadn't been for this defector, Vasily Mitrokhin, who was an archivist in the KGB

3:11:36.240 --> 3:11:38.960
 archives, he was actually pretty high level.

3:11:38.960 --> 3:11:48.200
 He was in charge of the relocation of the archive from Lubyanka to Yasenov.

3:11:48.200 --> 3:11:56.080
 And he really hated, he had reason to believe he hated the Soviet system.

3:11:56.080 --> 3:12:01.180
 I think I remember that his son was quite ill and he could have gotten treatment in

3:12:01.180 --> 3:12:05.680
 England and he was not allowed to travel to England with his son.

3:12:05.680 --> 3:12:12.480
 So his hatred, he tried to figure out what to do and how to do damage to that system.

3:12:12.480 --> 3:12:19.980
 So he started copying notes, little slips of paper, handwritten that he smuggled out

3:12:19.980 --> 3:12:23.960
 in his underwear and his socks over the years.

3:12:23.960 --> 3:12:32.480
 And then he transcribed them with a typewriter and then put the pieces of paper into some

3:12:32.480 --> 3:12:37.480
 kind of a container and buried this in his stash.

3:12:37.480 --> 3:12:45.760
 It was, I believe in 1992 when he showed up, that was already the Soviet Union was gone.

3:12:45.760 --> 3:12:51.600
 So he showed up at the US embassy in Moscow and told him what he had and it was on a weekend

3:12:51.600 --> 3:12:55.480
 and apparently there was a junior person in charge and he said, you know what, what you

3:12:55.480 --> 3:13:00.440
 got, we are not interested and it's really old.

3:13:00.440 --> 3:13:07.880
 It's a career limiting move, right, because Vasily Mitrokhin then made his way to one

3:13:07.880 --> 3:13:17.280
 of the Baltic republics and contacted MI6 and they said, come on in, old fellow, have

3:13:17.280 --> 3:13:19.920
 a cup of tea.

3:13:19.920 --> 3:13:25.680
 And so they managed to get this stuff out of the Dacha and get it to England and eventually

3:13:25.680 --> 3:13:32.920
 MI6 shared it with the FBI and there wasn't a whole lot of information about me, it was

3:13:32.920 --> 3:13:33.920
 very, very little.

3:13:33.920 --> 3:13:40.400
 It was like, there's a person by the name of Jack Barsky who is an illegal operating

3:13:40.400 --> 3:13:42.280
 in the northeast of the United States.

3:13:42.280 --> 3:13:47.780
 Now if it was Jim Miller, they wouldn't have found me, Jack Barsky was easy to find.

3:13:47.780 --> 3:13:55.700
 So they checked social security and Jack Barsky had gotten his social security card at the

3:13:55.700 --> 3:14:00.520
 age of 33, bingo, okay.

3:14:00.520 --> 3:14:04.320
 All they knew though was that I wasn't illegal, that I was still living there, they didn't

3:14:04.320 --> 3:14:10.640
 know whether I was active, inactive and the other thing that they knew that I was a really,

3:14:10.640 --> 3:14:15.160
 really well trained agent because I was still there, right.

3:14:15.160 --> 3:14:22.660
 So they took, I think, almost three years to investigate me, watch me from a distance

3:14:22.660 --> 3:14:30.000
 because if I was still active, I would have found out that somebody is investigating me.

3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:33.000
 So you started being less and less active in terms of...

3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:34.900
 Oh, I stopped completely.

3:14:34.900 --> 3:14:35.900
 What I mean is...

3:14:35.900 --> 3:14:36.900
 Oh, surveillance detection.

3:14:36.900 --> 3:14:37.900
 Yes, surveillance detection.

3:14:37.900 --> 3:14:40.000
 After three months, I stopped altogether.

3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:41.000
 Okay.

3:14:41.000 --> 3:14:42.000
 Yeah, good point.

3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:44.000
 And FBI is still very careful.

3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:45.400
 They were very careful.

3:14:45.400 --> 3:14:51.440
 They pretty much watched me and at one point, I had a house in the country with one neighbor,

3:14:51.440 --> 3:14:57.200
 at one point that house was for sale, so the FBI bought it and they put a couple of agents

3:14:57.200 --> 3:15:01.200
 there and just didn't keep a closer eye on me.

3:15:01.200 --> 3:15:12.360
 There was no indication that I was still active, but they were still cautious but at one point,

3:15:12.360 --> 3:15:23.160
 they were able to plant a bug in my kitchen, a listening device and my wife and I didn't

3:15:23.160 --> 3:15:24.160
 get along very well.

3:15:24.160 --> 3:15:29.600
 There was a lot of friction and she was constantly complaining about things and I got sick and

3:15:29.600 --> 3:15:39.200
 tired of it and one day we had an argument in the kitchen and I chose to deploy the nuclear

3:15:39.200 --> 3:15:48.960
 option and that is telling her what I sacrificed to be with her so she would understand that

3:15:48.960 --> 3:15:51.320
 I am there on her side.

3:15:51.320 --> 3:15:52.320
 I'm supporting her.

3:15:52.320 --> 3:15:57.860
 If something doesn't quite fit, it is not because I don't love the both of them, Chelsea

3:15:57.860 --> 3:15:59.400
 and Penelope.

3:15:59.400 --> 3:16:08.240
 So when I said that, the listening device was active, so the FBI was hearing my confession.

3:16:08.240 --> 3:16:17.200
 I was once a KGB agent, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah and I quit and then stayed here

3:16:17.200 --> 3:16:25.560
 because of you and Chelsea and that also made it clear to the FBI that I wasn't active

3:16:25.560 --> 3:16:26.560
 anymore.

3:16:26.560 --> 3:16:27.560
 They had both of that.

3:16:27.560 --> 3:16:36.760
 So now they knew an attempt to turn me would have been useless because you turned somebody

3:16:36.760 --> 3:16:46.280
 who was active, but they figured there was enough reason to treat me nicely because they

3:16:46.280 --> 3:16:53.560
 figured I had a lot of information that was as aged as it was, but it was still important

3:16:53.560 --> 3:16:56.240
 for the FBI to get to know.

3:16:56.240 --> 3:17:06.960
 And so one day, it was a Friday evening, I'm driving back home from the office and I'm

3:17:06.960 --> 3:17:16.360
 being stopped by a state police.

3:17:16.360 --> 3:17:22.520
 As I'm going through the toll, it's a bridge over the Hudson and they had to pay a toll

3:17:22.520 --> 3:17:29.280
 and he waved me, he got me right where I stopped and he said, could you please move over here?

3:17:29.280 --> 3:17:32.280
 It's a routine traffic stop and I thought nothing of it.

3:17:32.280 --> 3:17:39.680
 I had forgotten at that point that I once was a spy, it was gone.

3:17:39.680 --> 3:17:42.600
 And then he said, could you please step out of the car?

3:17:42.600 --> 3:17:45.200
 That should have aroused my suspicion.

3:17:45.200 --> 3:17:46.360
 That's unusual, right?

3:17:46.360 --> 3:17:47.760
 Routine traffic stop.

3:17:47.760 --> 3:17:49.760
 Yeah, I did it, no problem.

3:17:49.760 --> 3:17:57.760
 And then again, somebody came from the right, came into my view and he flipped his ID and

3:17:57.760 --> 3:18:02.440
 he said, FBI, we would like to have a talk with you.

3:18:02.440 --> 3:18:10.080
 This is my now friend, Joe Riley, who actually is the, he's the godfather of Trinity and

3:18:10.080 --> 3:18:11.080
 my last child.

3:18:11.080 --> 3:18:20.320
 Anyway, he told me later that when I heard that phrase, all the blood left my face, I

3:18:20.320 --> 3:18:24.340
 became totally white.

3:18:24.340 --> 3:18:32.600
 But I recovered very quickly and he said it himself, so they took me to a vehicle and

3:18:32.600 --> 3:18:39.440
 there was another agent in the vehicle and he had a gun strapped to his ankle, so it

3:18:39.440 --> 3:18:42.280
 was pretty real.

3:18:42.280 --> 3:18:44.640
 First question I had, so am I under arrest?

3:18:44.640 --> 3:18:47.600
 And the answer was no.

3:18:47.600 --> 3:18:57.200
 And then my instinct kicked in and my ability to operate very well under high pressure situations.

3:18:57.200 --> 3:19:01.520
 And I asked him, so what took you so long?

3:19:01.520 --> 3:19:12.360
 You know, the intent of that was to defuse any kind of tension.

3:19:12.360 --> 3:19:15.360
 And I saw a smile.

3:19:15.360 --> 3:19:16.360
 Instant friends.

3:19:16.360 --> 3:19:26.520
 Yeah, I knew that I had to make them like me and I'm, I think by now I know I'm a pretty

3:19:26.520 --> 3:19:31.280
 likable person.

3:19:31.280 --> 3:19:40.520
 And I, when they took me to a motel, which they had rented, there was two wings at a

3:19:40.520 --> 3:19:47.760
 right angle, they bought all the rooms in one wing and they had a guard at each end

3:19:47.760 --> 3:19:55.560
 of that wing and they took me in the middle and there were some props there, some binders

3:19:55.560 --> 3:20:03.680
 with labels and I immediately thought, this is pretty silly because what I noticed that

3:20:03.680 --> 3:20:07.440
 the labels all referred back to my early years.

3:20:07.440 --> 3:20:10.880
 I knew that they didn't know much else.

3:20:10.880 --> 3:20:19.520
 So I told Joe that afterwards and that was not a great idea, but anyway.

3:20:19.520 --> 3:20:20.520
 But I volunteered.

3:20:20.520 --> 3:20:24.200
 I made the following statement before we even started the interview.

3:20:24.200 --> 3:20:30.160
 I said, I know there's only one way for me to, and my family, to have a chance to get

3:20:30.160 --> 3:20:38.680
 through here without much damages if I'm completely 100% cooperative and it's my intent to do

3:20:38.680 --> 3:20:39.920
 exactly that.

3:20:39.920 --> 3:20:40.920
 All right.

3:20:40.920 --> 3:20:43.680
 So we spent about two hours in the interview.

3:20:43.680 --> 3:20:48.340
 They allowed me to call my wife, tell her that I'm going to be late.

3:20:48.340 --> 3:20:51.240
 That indicated to me already that they would let me go.

3:20:51.240 --> 3:20:55.000
 And after two hours they let me go.

3:20:55.000 --> 3:21:00.000
 But they had the area covered with a whole bunch of people.

3:21:00.000 --> 3:21:07.520
 And the head of that team talked to me and he said, if you think of running, we got every

3:21:07.520 --> 3:21:09.560
 intersection in this area covered.

3:21:09.560 --> 3:21:10.560
 You can't.

3:21:10.560 --> 3:21:16.620
 I didn't say anything, but you know, I had no thought of running.

3:21:16.620 --> 3:21:24.040
 So and that was the beginning of another phase of my life where I was cooperating with the

3:21:24.040 --> 3:21:30.240
 FBI for quite a while and living still undercover for several years until I had real good documentation

3:21:30.240 --> 3:21:33.840
 and became an American citizen seven years ago.

3:21:33.840 --> 3:21:36.480
 From today, seven years ago.

3:21:36.480 --> 3:21:37.480
 So recently.

3:21:37.480 --> 3:21:38.480
 Yeah.

3:21:38.480 --> 3:21:39.480
 Wow.

3:21:39.480 --> 3:21:40.480
 Quite recent.

3:21:40.480 --> 3:21:49.440
 The hypocrisy took a long time to figure out how to make me real and also not put me in

3:21:49.440 --> 3:21:55.080
 these witness protection program, you know, to keep my name and then just, you know, make

3:21:55.080 --> 3:21:57.320
 everything like official.

3:21:57.320 --> 3:22:03.880
 So for instance, I had to change my birth year simply because if I, Jack Barsky was

3:22:03.880 --> 3:22:09.900
 born in 1944, if I kept 1944, the FBI would have helped me commit a crime because I would

3:22:09.900 --> 3:22:15.820
 have collected social security four years sooner.

3:22:15.820 --> 3:22:20.120
 So anyway, yes, it took quite a while.

3:22:20.120 --> 3:22:29.120
 And when I finally got the call from the office of Homeland Security, the lady says, this

3:22:29.120 --> 3:22:37.240
 is agent so and so from Homeland Security, can you come into the office tomorrow?

3:22:37.240 --> 3:22:42.040
 And I said, let me look at my calendar.

3:22:42.040 --> 3:22:45.000
 And then I said, wait a minute, what am I talking about?

3:22:45.000 --> 3:22:47.100
 What time do you want me to be there?

3:22:47.100 --> 3:22:49.360
 Because I had waited for that moment for a long time.

3:22:49.360 --> 3:22:52.760
 And I was sworn in right then and there.

3:22:52.760 --> 3:22:58.400
 It was a good feeling to walk out of there because I had a country again, you know, and

3:22:58.400 --> 3:23:03.520
 I love this country just as much as you said you love it with all its warts and its problems

3:23:03.520 --> 3:23:06.880
 that we're going through right now.

3:23:06.880 --> 3:23:12.780
 And then the last thing that changed my life again, and I don't want to get into details

3:23:12.780 --> 3:23:18.900
 because it's a little complicated story, I never wanted to be a public person.

3:23:18.900 --> 3:23:26.200
 And then I was discovered through a number of dots that were unlikely to be connected.

3:23:26.200 --> 3:23:33.440
 It had to do with a relative, with a half brother of my wife who lives in Germany, was

3:23:33.440 --> 3:23:41.200
 taken to Germany by his mother who came to visit somebody, not us, but that somebody

3:23:41.200 --> 3:23:49.240
 that he came to visit lived 50 miles from our house and that my wife and this half brother

3:23:49.240 --> 3:23:52.000
 never met in person before.

3:23:52.000 --> 3:23:54.960
 They knew about each other through social media.

3:23:54.960 --> 3:24:01.120
 And when he found out my background, he was a conductor of the German railroad at the

3:24:01.120 --> 3:24:07.960
 time, he said, oh, this is a big story and that's going to be big, big, big, okay.

3:24:07.960 --> 3:24:14.080
 Well he happened to know this one person who happened to know one of the star reporters

3:24:14.080 --> 3:24:23.000
 of Der Spiegel and after she did some research and determined that I was real, she was on

3:24:23.000 --> 3:24:24.000
 my case.

3:24:24.000 --> 3:24:29.720
 And she happened to know Steve Croft, the guy from 60 Minutes, you see all these connections?

3:24:29.720 --> 3:24:30.800
 I had nothing to do with it.

3:24:30.800 --> 3:24:35.400
 That's how life works, dots get connected somehow, sometimes, for most of us it doesn't.

3:24:35.400 --> 3:24:36.400
 Stuff happens.

3:24:36.400 --> 3:24:37.400
 You get lucky.

3:24:37.400 --> 3:24:38.400
 You don't know what's happening.

3:24:38.400 --> 3:24:40.560
 You've gotten lucky a few times in your life.

3:24:40.560 --> 3:24:44.640
 Yeah, I think I must be part Irish too.

3:24:44.640 --> 3:24:53.080
 Yeah, so it's been an interesting ride.

3:24:53.080 --> 3:24:57.360
 I'm just still shaking my head about all the stuff that happened.

3:24:57.360 --> 3:24:58.760
 It's been a fun one.

3:24:58.760 --> 3:25:06.800
 But you wrote, because I'm allowed to leave behind a documented legacy of my unusual life,

3:25:06.800 --> 3:25:12.800
 I'm praying that the legacy will be described by a single word, love.

3:25:12.800 --> 3:25:17.520
 So let us return to the thing we started the conversation with, which is love.

3:25:17.520 --> 3:25:24.920
 What role does love play in this human condition, in your life and in our life here together?

3:25:24.920 --> 3:25:31.600
 I give you an answer by telling you what happened one day.

3:25:31.600 --> 3:25:37.640
 I gave a presentation at Microsoft headquarters.

3:25:37.640 --> 3:25:40.240
 That's a strange beginning of a love story, but yes.

3:25:40.240 --> 3:25:41.680
 No, that's not a love story.

3:25:41.680 --> 3:25:49.000
 And so there's this beautiful young lady sitting in the back, and she's paying a lot of attention.

3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:56.400
 Turned out later that her job at Microsoft, her job title was storyteller.

3:25:56.400 --> 3:25:58.560
 It's soft marketing, right?

3:25:58.560 --> 3:26:01.800
 Yeah, you could say that.

3:26:01.800 --> 3:26:06.800
 But if you can't afford somebody like that, that's good.

3:26:06.800 --> 3:26:15.840
 Anyway, question and answer, she raised her hand and she asked me, so all the things that

3:26:15.840 --> 3:26:21.560
 you have done and you have experienced, what's the number one lesson you've taken away from

3:26:21.560 --> 3:26:22.560
 your life?

3:26:22.560 --> 3:26:25.280
 That was a new question for me.

3:26:25.280 --> 3:26:27.720
 I've never been asked that question.

3:26:27.720 --> 3:26:35.320
 And I thought about it for 20 seconds, and then I came up with this phrase that we all

3:26:35.320 --> 3:26:42.560
 know, love conquers all, because in my life it did, in the end.

3:26:42.560 --> 3:26:50.280
 And it's the strongest human emotion, and that is what makes us human, really.

3:26:50.280 --> 3:26:57.540
 And you spoke about the, I mean, offline as I've spoken with you, it's clear to me how

3:26:57.540 --> 3:27:04.640
 transformative, how powerful the life of your children are, your daughters in your life,

3:27:04.640 --> 3:27:09.280
 and who you are, and why you think life is beautiful, and why you think this country

3:27:09.280 --> 3:27:10.560
 is beautiful.

3:27:10.560 --> 3:27:23.880
 Now that I'm pretty mature, to put it mildly, I'm also more loving towards many more people.

3:27:23.880 --> 3:27:28.840
 These things like random acts of kindness for strangers, I do them, I'm looking for

3:27:28.840 --> 3:27:29.840
 them now.

3:27:29.840 --> 3:27:30.840
 And you know what?

3:27:30.840 --> 3:27:31.840
 It's good for me.

3:27:31.840 --> 3:27:38.420
 Well, welcome to Texas, because this random acts of kindness to strangers seems to be

3:27:38.420 --> 3:27:44.480
 a way of life, which is one of the reasons I love it here.

3:27:44.480 --> 3:27:50.160
 It just reminds me why I love human beings, is that there's just this warmth, this connection.

3:27:50.160 --> 3:27:52.680
 Yeah, and Georgia is the same thing.

3:27:52.680 --> 3:27:53.680
 Yeah.

3:27:53.680 --> 3:27:54.680
 Amen.

3:27:54.680 --> 3:27:58.840
 Do you have any regrets?

3:27:58.840 --> 3:28:02.280
 Looking back at life, do you wish you'd done something different?

3:28:02.280 --> 3:28:08.920
 I could have, but then I would have a different regret.

3:28:08.920 --> 3:28:12.440
 I betrayed the wife, the German wife that I loved.

3:28:12.440 --> 3:28:16.740
 I really did love her, and I betrayed her.

3:28:16.740 --> 3:28:24.680
 But if I don't betray her, then I betray the child.

3:28:24.680 --> 3:28:27.400
 That is a source of so much love for you now.

3:28:27.400 --> 3:28:34.920
 So maybe life is a kind of, you get to choose your regrets.

3:28:34.920 --> 3:28:35.920
 You don't get to avoid them.

3:28:35.920 --> 3:28:43.680
 Yeah, it's a little bit of a strange way of putting it, but there's no other choice.

3:28:43.680 --> 3:28:50.600
 I tell you what I don't regret, and that may be, you probably understand it now because

3:28:50.600 --> 3:28:55.960
 you have enough background about me, I don't regret having lied to my mother.

3:28:55.960 --> 3:29:00.600
 Because I had no really strong emotional relationship with her.

3:29:00.600 --> 3:29:09.760
 She took care of me, she was proud of me, but we didn't hug, we didn't interact emotionally

3:29:09.760 --> 3:29:10.760
 whatsoever.

3:29:10.760 --> 3:29:15.520
 So you don't feel like you betrayed that love that—

3:29:15.520 --> 3:29:23.700
 Well I did, I know that she was looking for me until the day she died.

3:29:23.700 --> 3:29:30.120
 She wrote a letter to President Gorbachev asking him for help to locate me.

3:29:30.120 --> 3:29:40.880
 She checked with Astazi, she just was hell bent on finding me and couldn't find me,

3:29:40.880 --> 3:29:45.600
 so she passed away without knowing what happened to me.

3:29:45.600 --> 3:29:52.400
 Now there was this rumor that was flying around, and she possibly may have bought into that

3:29:52.400 --> 3:30:01.480
 rumor because my cover for when I went to the United States was that I changed careers

3:30:01.480 --> 3:30:11.560
 again and I joined an institution in Kazakhstan that did space research, intercosmos something

3:30:11.560 --> 3:30:21.360
 something, and I had a piece of paper that invited me to start there, and it was a forgery.

3:30:21.360 --> 3:30:32.040
 It never existed, but people knew that in Kazakhstan there were super secret facilities.

3:30:32.040 --> 3:30:38.780
 One of my classmates, old classmates from high school started the rumor that I died

3:30:38.780 --> 3:30:43.280
 in a rocket accident, and everybody knew that.

3:30:43.280 --> 3:30:52.440
 So when I came back to Germany, I found the telephone number of this girl that had dumped

3:30:52.440 --> 3:30:53.440
 me.

3:30:53.440 --> 3:30:59.600
 I called her, and I said, so guess who this is?

3:30:59.600 --> 3:31:04.680
 Maybe you hold on to your chair, she says yes, I said, this is Albrecht.

3:31:04.680 --> 3:31:09.880
 It's a good payback.

3:31:09.880 --> 3:31:12.460
 No, we actually met.

3:31:12.460 --> 3:31:21.560
 So there's two elderly people in their 60s who meet each other after so many years, and

3:31:21.560 --> 3:31:28.360
 the one that ended the relationship started the conversation by saying, you know what,

3:31:28.360 --> 3:31:33.800
 I made a really bad mistake, and the tears came down her cheeks.

3:31:33.800 --> 3:31:34.800
 I wasn't asking for that.

3:31:34.800 --> 3:31:39.160
 I wasn't happy about it, but it did feel good.

3:31:39.160 --> 3:31:46.320
 Now a while later, I knew why she said she made a mistake.

3:31:46.320 --> 3:31:47.320
 I met her husband.

3:31:47.320 --> 3:31:59.000
 Yeah, I mean, there's a, Tom Waits has a song called Martha, where an older gentleman calls

3:31:59.000 --> 3:32:01.440
 somebody he used to love, and they have a conversation.

3:32:01.440 --> 3:32:07.080
 They're both married now, and sometimes you can meet people from your past, and it gives

3:32:07.080 --> 3:32:11.040
 you a glimpse of a possible different life you could have had.

3:32:11.040 --> 3:32:15.680
 Oh yeah, and you know, I was actually, when she said I made a mistake, and I was thinking

3:32:15.680 --> 3:32:19.680
 to myself, no, you didn't.

3:32:19.680 --> 3:32:20.680
 There was none.

3:32:20.680 --> 3:32:21.680
 There was nothing left.

3:32:21.680 --> 3:32:24.360
 There was nothing left.

3:32:24.360 --> 3:32:33.200
 Also the person that she became, personality wise, wasn't as attractive as I remembered

3:32:33.200 --> 3:32:34.200
 her.

3:32:34.200 --> 3:32:35.200
 You know, it's puppy love.

3:32:35.200 --> 3:32:37.200
 But it's still love, and it still happened.

3:32:37.200 --> 3:32:38.200
 Yeah, it was.

3:32:38.200 --> 3:32:46.080
 It was passionate love for sure, and I would have thrown myself under the bus if I could

3:32:46.080 --> 3:32:47.080
 save her.

3:32:47.080 --> 3:32:54.480
 It was that strong, and it's just as strong as the love for my two girls.

3:32:54.480 --> 3:33:00.440
 Life is full of moments and periods like that of love, and that's what makes life so freaking

3:33:00.440 --> 3:33:01.640
 awesome.

3:33:01.640 --> 3:33:03.840
 But it does come to an end.

3:33:03.840 --> 3:33:07.440
 And so does this conversation, I guess.

3:33:07.440 --> 3:33:11.920
 This goes on for many more hours, but yes, do you think about your own death?

3:33:11.920 --> 3:33:12.920
 Huh?

3:33:12.920 --> 3:33:13.920
 Do you think about death?

3:33:13.920 --> 3:33:14.920
 Do you think about your own death?

3:33:14.920 --> 3:33:15.920
 Yes.

3:33:15.920 --> 3:33:17.920
 Are you afraid of it?

3:33:17.920 --> 3:33:18.920
 Yes.

3:33:18.920 --> 3:33:23.920
 Even though I'm a Christian.

3:33:23.920 --> 3:33:28.320
 As a Christian, do you have a sense what's coming after, or is it full of uncertainty?

3:33:28.320 --> 3:33:30.240
 I have a hope.

3:33:30.240 --> 3:33:32.340
 I have a hope.

3:33:32.340 --> 3:33:40.620
 You know, there's a lot of Christianity which is quite logical, a lot of Christianity which

3:33:40.620 --> 3:33:46.760
 is also the life of Christ, there's a lot of proof.

3:33:46.760 --> 3:34:08.840
 But I became a Christian starting with a head, and I was already quite old.

3:34:08.840 --> 3:34:17.000
 When you don't get this faith very early, it's tougher to buy into everything.

3:34:17.000 --> 3:34:25.000
 You know, there are some things that are difficult for me to understand and believe, but there's

3:34:25.000 --> 3:34:29.960
 many, many other things that I can't explain only with the existence of a God, but whether

3:34:29.960 --> 3:34:37.480
 He lets us go again for an eternity, I just hope.

3:34:37.480 --> 3:34:42.720
 I won't convince somebody else at this point, which doesn't make me a really, really good

3:34:42.720 --> 3:34:46.640
 Christian because I'm supposed to evangelize.

3:34:46.640 --> 3:34:47.640
 But there's still a fear.

3:34:47.640 --> 3:34:48.640
 Yeah.

3:34:48.640 --> 3:34:51.000
 There's a fear and a hope.

3:34:51.000 --> 3:35:03.760
 On the other hand, I know that, you see, this is how I approach the last years of my life.

3:35:03.760 --> 3:35:08.520
 I will not mentally or physically get decrepit.

3:35:08.520 --> 3:35:14.440
 I will do everything I can do to be alert and fit.

3:35:14.440 --> 3:35:16.200
 I still run.

3:35:16.200 --> 3:35:21.720
 I run four or five times a week, and I'm going to start lifting weights again.

3:35:21.720 --> 3:35:22.720
 Good.

3:35:22.720 --> 3:35:25.400
 You stay physically and mentally sharp.

3:35:25.400 --> 3:35:26.400
 Yes.

3:35:26.400 --> 3:35:28.840
 Go out with guns blazing.

3:35:28.840 --> 3:35:38.640
 I once read a book written by a medical doctor, he said, most people, when they're becoming

3:35:38.640 --> 3:35:46.640
 mature, the rest of their life is a slow downward move.

3:35:46.640 --> 3:35:47.640
 Not for you.

3:35:47.640 --> 3:35:48.640
 No.

3:35:48.640 --> 3:35:52.480
 The last years are pretty bad.

3:35:52.480 --> 3:35:55.920
 He said, you got to do this, boom.

3:35:55.920 --> 3:35:59.040
 That's pretty good advice from a doctor.

3:35:59.040 --> 3:36:06.200
 If nothing else from Christianity, whichever parts you take on, one of the big ones is

3:36:06.200 --> 3:36:07.200
 love.

3:36:07.200 --> 3:36:12.920
 That's something you've lived from the very beginning before God was part of your life,

3:36:12.920 --> 3:36:14.280
 before anything was part of your life.

3:36:14.280 --> 3:36:18.840
 It seemed that love was part of your life and has been a consistent thread throughout.

3:36:18.840 --> 3:36:19.840
 Yes, sir.

3:36:19.840 --> 3:36:27.880
 There's a short sentence in the Bible that says, God is love.

3:36:27.880 --> 3:36:37.080
 The other thing I want to say, the Christian morality is, I can sign that with my blood.

3:36:37.080 --> 3:36:38.080
 God is love.

3:36:38.080 --> 3:36:39.080
 Amen.

3:36:39.080 --> 3:36:45.180
 Jack, you're an incredible person, lived an incredible life.

3:36:45.180 --> 3:36:46.180
 Thank you for talking today.

3:36:46.180 --> 3:36:48.720
 Thank you for telling your story.

3:36:48.720 --> 3:36:53.720
 Thank you for being who you are, and thank you for being all about love.

3:36:53.720 --> 3:36:56.160
 This is a beautiful conversation, it was an honor.

3:36:56.160 --> 3:36:57.160
 Thank you for talking today.

3:36:57.160 --> 3:37:00.880
 Yeah, and I appreciate the tough questions that you asked.

3:37:00.880 --> 3:37:03.080
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jack Barsky.

 And now, let me leave you with some words from Edward Snowden.

3:37:11.380 --> 3:37:15.700
 You can't come up against the world's most powerful intelligence agencies and not accept

3:37:15.700 --> 3:37:16.700
 the risk.

3:37:16.700 --> 3:37:22.280
 If they want to get you, over time, they will.

3:37:22.280 --> 3:37:48.920
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
