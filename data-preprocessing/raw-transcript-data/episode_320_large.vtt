00:00.000 --> 00:08.720
 The lesson I would want everyone to take from the story of the First World War is that

00:10.640 --> 00:18.240
 human life is not cheap. That all of the warring powers thought that just by throwing

00:19.200 --> 00:25.840
 more men and more material at the front, they would solve their political problems with military

00:25.840 --> 00:33.520
 force. And at the end of the day in 1918, one side did win that, but it didn't actually solve

00:33.520 --> 00:37.920
 any of those political problems. You said that World War I gave birth to the surveillance state

00:37.920 --> 00:46.000
 in the US. Can you explain? The following is a conversation with Christopher Capozzola,

00:46.000 --> 00:52.960
 a historian at MIT specializing in the history of politics and war in modern American history,

00:52.960 --> 00:57.840
 especially about the role of World War I in defining the trajectory of the United States

00:57.840 --> 01:04.800
 and our human civilization in the 20th and 21st centuries. This is the Lux Friedman podcast. To

01:09.280 --> 01:15.520
 here's Christopher Capozzola. Let's start with a big and difficult question. How did World War I

01:15.520 --> 01:22.720
 start? On the one hand, World War I started because of a series of events in the summer of 1914,

01:22.720 --> 01:28.640
 and that brought the major powers of Europe into conflict with one another. But I actually think

01:28.640 --> 01:37.200
 it's more useful to say that World War I started at least a generation earlier when rising powers,

01:37.200 --> 01:43.200
 particularly Germany, started devoting more and more of their resources toward military affairs

01:43.200 --> 01:50.160
 and naval affairs. This sets off an arms race in Europe. It sets off a rivalry over the colonial

01:50.160 --> 01:56.320
 world and who will control the resources in Africa and Asia. And so by the time you get to the summer

01:56.320 --> 02:02.000
 of 1914, and in a lot of ways I say the war has already begun, and this is just the match that

02:02.000 --> 02:08.240
 lights the flame. So the capacity for war was brewing within like the leaders and within the

02:08.240 --> 02:15.920
 populace. They started accepting sort of slowly through the culture propagated this idea that

02:15.920 --> 02:24.160
 we can go to war, it's a good idea to go to war, it's a good idea to expand and dominate others,

02:24.160 --> 02:30.160
 that kind of thing. Maybe not put in those clear terms, but just the sense that military action is

02:30.160 --> 02:37.760
 the way that nations operate at the global scale. Yes, yes and, right. So yes, there's a sense that

02:37.760 --> 02:44.240
 the military can be the solution to political conflict in Europe itself. And the and is that

02:44.240 --> 02:50.720
 war and military conflict are already happening, right? That there's war particularly in Africa,

02:50.720 --> 02:57.600
 in North Africa, in the Middle East, in the Balkans. Conflict is already underway and the

02:57.600 --> 03:01.920
 European powers haven't faced off against each other. They've usually faced off against

03:01.920 --> 03:08.160
 an asymmetrical conflict against much less powerful states. But in some ways that war is

03:08.160 --> 03:15.440
 already underway. So do you think it was inevitable? Because World War One is brought up as a case

03:15.440 --> 03:23.600
 study where it seems like a few accidental leaders and a few accidental events or one accidental

03:23.600 --> 03:28.720
 event led to the war. And if you change that one little thing, it could have avoided the war. Your

03:28.720 --> 03:35.120
 sense is that the drums of war have been beating for quite a while and it would have happened

03:35.120 --> 03:40.400
 almost no matter what or very likely to have happened. Yes, historians never like to say things

03:40.400 --> 03:45.680
 are inevitable. And certainly, you know, there were people who could have chosen a different path

03:45.680 --> 03:52.960
 both in the short term and the long term. But fundamentally, there were irreconcilable conflicts

03:52.960 --> 04:00.000
 in the system of empires in the world in 1914. I can't see, you know, it didn't have to be this war

04:00.000 --> 04:05.920
 but it probably had to be a war. So there was the German Empire, the Austro Hungarian Empire,

04:06.640 --> 04:12.960
 there's France and Great Britain, US. Could USP call that empire at that moment yet?

04:14.320 --> 04:20.960
 When do you graduate to empire status? Well, certainly after 1898 with the acquisition of

04:20.960 --> 04:24.960
 the former territories of the Spanish Empire, you know, the United States has formal colonial

04:24.960 --> 04:32.720
 possessions and it has sort of mindsets of rule and military acquisition that would define empire

04:32.720 --> 04:39.680
 in a kind of more informal sense. So you would say you would put the blame or the responsibility

04:40.320 --> 04:45.040
 of starting World War I into the hands of the German Empire and Kaiser Wilhelm II?

04:45.840 --> 04:52.800
 You know, that's a really tough call to make. And, you know, deciding that is going to keep

04:52.800 --> 05:01.440
 historians in business for the next 200 years. I think there are people who would lay all of the

05:01.440 --> 05:07.840
 blame on the Germans, right? And, you know, who would point toward a generation of arms build up,

05:08.400 --> 05:14.960
 you know, alliances that Germany made and promises that they made to their allies in the Balkans,

05:14.960 --> 05:20.560
 to the Austro Hungarians. And so yes, there's an awful lot of responsibility there.

05:20.560 --> 05:27.360
 There has been a trend lately to say, no, it's no one's fault, right? That, you know,

05:27.360 --> 05:32.480
 that all of the various powers literally were sleepwalking into the war, right? They backed into

05:32.480 --> 05:37.440
 it inadvertently. I think that lets everyone a little too much off the hook, right? And so I

05:37.440 --> 05:44.080
 think in between is, you know, I would put the blame on the system of empires itself, on the

05:44.080 --> 05:50.560
 system. But in that system, the actor that sort of carries the most responsibility is definitely

05:50.560 --> 05:58.800
 Imperial Germany. So the leader of the Austro Hungarian Empire, Franz Joseph I, his nephews,

05:58.800 --> 06:09.840
 Archduke Franz Ferdinand, he was assassinated. And so that didn't have to lead to a war. And then

06:09.840 --> 06:22.080
 the leader of the German Empire, Kaiser Wilhelm II, pressured, sort of started talking trash

06:23.920 --> 06:30.720
 and boiling the water that ultimately resulted in the explosion, plus all the other players.

06:30.720 --> 06:36.320
 So what can you describe the dynamics of how that unrolled? Well, US, what's the role of US? What's

06:36.320 --> 06:40.960
 the role of France? What's the role of Great Britain, Germany, and Austro Hungarian Empire?

06:41.600 --> 06:48.800
 Yeah, over the course of about four weeks, right, following the assassination of the Archduke

06:48.800 --> 06:55.920
 in Sarajevo, it sort of triggers a series of political conflicts and ultimately ultimatums,

06:56.640 --> 07:04.160
 sort of demanding sort of that one or other power sort of stand down in response to the demands of

07:04.160 --> 07:11.520
 either Britain, France, or in turn, Germany or Russia, at the same time that those alliances

07:11.520 --> 07:18.080
 kind of trigger automatic responses from the other side. And so it escalates. And once that

07:18.080 --> 07:24.240
 escalation is combined with the call up of military troops, then none of those powers wants

07:24.240 --> 07:30.720
 to be sort of the last one to kind of get ready for conflict. So even throughout it, they think

07:30.720 --> 07:38.160
 they are getting ready in a defensive maneuver. And if they think if there is conflict, well,

07:38.160 --> 07:43.840
 it might be a skirmish, it might be, you know, sort of a standoff. It could be solved with

07:43.840 --> 07:51.120
 diplomacy later, because diplomacy is failing now. That turns out not to be the case. Diplomacy fails,

07:51.120 --> 07:55.600
 it's not a skirmish, it becomes a massive war. And the Americans are watching all of this from

07:55.600 --> 07:59.760
 the sidelines. They have very little influence over what happens that summer.

07:59.760 --> 08:06.960
 How does it go from a skirmish between a few nations to a global war? Is there a place where

08:06.960 --> 08:12.480
 there's a phase transition? Yeah, I think the phase transition is in over the course of the fall of

08:12.480 --> 08:20.000
 1914. When the Germans make an initial sort of bold move into France, in many ways, they're

08:20.000 --> 08:28.240
 fighting the last war, the Franco Prussian War of 1870. And they really do sort of, you know, kind

08:28.240 --> 08:35.440
 of want to have a quick sort of lightning strike in some ways against France to kind of bring the war

08:35.440 --> 08:42.320
 to a speedy conclusion. France turns out to be able to fight back more effectively than the Germans

08:42.320 --> 08:52.800
 expected. And then the battle lines sort of harden. And then behind that, the French and the Germans,

08:52.800 --> 09:00.720
 as well as the British on the side of the French, start digging in, literally, and digging trenches.

09:00.720 --> 09:08.000
 Trenches that at first are three feet deep to avoid shelling from artillery, then become six

09:08.000 --> 09:14.480
 feet, 10 feet deep, two miles wide, that include telegraph wires, that include whole hospitals in

09:14.480 --> 09:21.680
 the back. And then at that point, the front is locked in place. And the only way to break that

09:21.680 --> 09:27.920
 is sort of basically dialing the war up to 11, right? Sort of massive numbers of troops, massive

09:27.920 --> 09:34.640
 efforts, none of which work, right? And so the war is stuck in this. But that's the phase transition

09:34.640 --> 09:42.000
 right there. What were the machines of war in that case? You mentioned trenches. What were the guns

09:42.000 --> 09:50.080
 used? What was the size of guns? What are we talking about? What did Germany start accumulating

09:50.080 --> 09:57.440
 that led up to this war? One of the things that we see immediately is the industrial revolution

09:57.440 --> 10:05.200
 of the previous 30 or 40 years brought to bear on warfare, right? And so you see sort of machine

10:05.200 --> 10:13.920
 guns. You see artillery. These are the key weapons of war on both sides, right? The vast majority of

10:13.920 --> 10:21.520
 battlefield casualties are from artillery shelling from one side to another, not sort of rifle or

10:21.520 --> 10:28.960
 even sort of machine gun kind of attacks. In some ways, the weapons of war are human beings, right?

10:29.680 --> 10:36.400
 Tens of thousands of them horde over the top in these sort of waves to kind of try to break through

10:36.400 --> 10:42.560
 the enemy lines. And it would work for a little while. But holding the territory that had been

10:42.560 --> 10:50.000
 gained often proved to be even more demanding than gaining it. And so often, each side would retreat

10:50.000 --> 10:57.120
 back into the trenches and wait for another day. And how did Russia, how did Britain,

10:58.400 --> 11:05.120
 how did France get pulled into the war? I suppose the France one is the easy one. But what is the

11:05.120 --> 11:12.000
 order of events here? How it becomes a global war? Yeah. So Britain, France, and Russia are at this

11:12.000 --> 11:20.560
 time and they're an alliance. And so the conflicts in the summer of 1914 that lead sort of to the

11:20.560 --> 11:28.480
 declarations of war happened sort of one after another in late August of 1914. And all three

11:28.480 --> 11:34.400
 powers essentially come in at the same time because they have promised to do so through a series of

11:34.400 --> 11:42.320
 alliances conducted secretly in the years before 1914 that committed them to defend one another.

11:42.320 --> 11:48.240
 Germany, Austria, Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire have their own sort of set of secret agreements

11:48.240 --> 11:54.960
 that also commit them to defend one another. And what this does is it sort of brings them all into

11:54.960 --> 12:00.480
 conflict at the exact same moment. They're also, for many of these countries, bringing not just

12:00.480 --> 12:06.640
 their national armies, but also their empires into the conflict. So Britain and France, of course,

12:06.640 --> 12:12.800
 have enormous sort of global empires. They begin mobilizing soldiers as well as raw materials.

12:13.360 --> 12:19.200
 Germany has less of an overseas empire. Russia and the Ottoman Empire, of course, have their own sort

12:19.200 --> 12:26.240
 of hinterland within the empire. And very soon, all of the warring powers are bringing the entire

12:26.240 --> 12:32.320
 world into the conflict. Did they have a sense of how deadly the war is? I mean, this is another

12:33.440 --> 12:41.600
 scale of death and destruction. At the beginning, no, but very quickly, the scale of the devastation

12:41.600 --> 12:47.920
 of these sort of massive over the top attacks on the trenches is apparent to the military officers

12:47.920 --> 12:53.680
 and it very quickly becomes apparent even at home. You know, there is, of course, censorship of the

12:53.680 --> 13:00.320
 battlefield and specific details don't reach people. But for civilians and in any of the

13:00.320 --> 13:06.400
 warring powers, they know fairly soon how destructive the war is. And to me, that's

13:06.400 --> 13:13.360
 always been a real sort of puzzle, right? That by the time the United States comes to decide whether

13:13.360 --> 13:19.120
 to join the war in 1917, they know exactly what they're getting into, right? They're not backing

13:19.120 --> 13:24.880
 into the war in the ways that the European powers did. You know, they've seen the devastation,

13:24.880 --> 13:30.720
 they've seen photographs, they've seen injured soldiers, and they make that choice anyway.

13:30.720 --> 13:34.000
 When you say they, do you mean the leaders of the people? Did

13:37.520 --> 13:42.480
 the death and destruction reach the minds of the American people by that time?

13:42.480 --> 13:51.280
 AOB Yes, absolutely. We don't in 1917 have the mass media that we have now, but there are images

13:51.280 --> 13:57.200
 in newspapers, there are newsreels that play at the movie theaters, and of course, some of it is

13:57.200 --> 14:04.960
 sanitized. But that combined with press accounts, often really quite descriptive press accounts,

14:04.960 --> 14:11.120
 gory accounts, reached anyone who cared to read them. Certainly, plenty of people didn't follow

14:11.120 --> 14:16.960
 the news, felt it was far away. But most Americans who cared about the news knew how devastating this

14:16.960 --> 14:23.520
 war was. LR Yeah, there's something that happens that I recently visited Ukraine for a few weeks.

14:24.480 --> 14:32.160
 There's something that happens with the human mind as you get away from the actual front where

14:32.160 --> 14:38.640
 the bullets are flying, like literally one kilometer away. You start to not feel the war.

14:38.640 --> 14:44.000
 AOB You'll hear an explosion, you'll see an explosion, you start to get assimilated to it,

14:44.000 --> 14:49.760
 or you start to get used to it. And then when you get as far away from currently what is Kiev,

14:51.520 --> 14:57.520
 you know the war's going on, everybody around you is fighting in that war, but it's still somehow

14:57.520 --> 15:04.240
 distant. And I think with the United States, with the ocean between, even if you have the stories

15:04.240 --> 15:12.400
 everywhere, it still is somehow distant, like the way a movie is. Like a movie or a video game,

15:12.400 --> 15:17.680
 it's somewhere else, even if your loved ones are going, or you are going to fight.

15:17.680 --> 15:22.880
 LR Yeah, that is absolutely the case. And in some ways, that's true even for the home fronts in

15:22.880 --> 15:29.280
 Europe, except for the areas where, in Belgium and France, where the war is right there in your

15:29.280 --> 15:35.200
 backyard. For other people, yeah, there's a distance. And soldiers, of course, feel this

15:35.200 --> 15:42.560
 very strongly. European soldiers, when they're able to go home on leave, often deeply resent

15:44.400 --> 15:48.400
 what they see as the luxury that civilians are living in during the war.

15:48.400 --> 15:59.120
 LR So how did US enter the war? Who was the president? What was the dynamics involved? And could it have stayed out?

15:59.120 --> 16:06.000
 LR To answer your last question first, yes. That the United States could have stayed out of the

16:06.000 --> 16:14.480
 First World War as a military power. The United States could not have ignored the war completely.

16:14.480 --> 16:22.080
 It shaped everything. It shaped trade. It shaped goods and services, agriculture, whether

16:22.640 --> 16:27.040
 there was a crop coming, whether there were immigrants coming across the Atlantic to work

16:27.040 --> 16:34.240
 in American factories. So the US can't ignore the war. But the US makes a choice in 1917 to enter

16:34.240 --> 16:44.000
 the war by declaring war on Germany and Austria. And in that sense, this is a war of choice,

16:44.000 --> 16:50.880
 but it's kicked off by a series of events. So President Woodrow Wilson has been president

16:50.880 --> 16:58.640
 through this entire period of time. He has just run in the 1916 presidential election on a campaign

16:58.640 --> 17:05.440
 to keep the United States out of war. But then in early 1917, the Germans in some ways

17:06.000 --> 17:12.080
 sort of twist the Americans arms. The Germans sort of high command comes to understand that

17:12.080 --> 17:19.440
 they're stuck. They're stuck in this trench warfare. They need a big breakthrough. Their one

17:19.440 --> 17:26.720
 big chance is to sort of break the blockade to push through that the British have imposed on them,

17:26.720 --> 17:35.360
 to break through against France. And so they do. And along with this, they start sinking ships on

17:35.360 --> 17:40.880
 the Atlantic, including American ships. The Germans know full well this will draw the United States

17:40.880 --> 17:47.360
 into war. But the Germans look at the United States at this moment, a relatively small army,

17:47.360 --> 17:53.360
 a relatively small Navy, a country that at least on paper is deeply divided about whether to join

17:53.360 --> 18:00.400
 the war. And so they say, let's do it. They're not going to get any American soldiers there in time.

18:01.760 --> 18:10.160
 It was a gamble, but I think probably their best chance. They took that gamble. They lost.

18:10.160 --> 18:15.840
 Right. In part, because French resistance was strong in part because Americans mobilized much

18:15.840 --> 18:19.680
 faster and in much greater numbers than the Germans thought they would. So the American

18:19.680 --> 18:24.000
 people were divided. The American people were absolutely divided about whether to enter this

18:24.000 --> 18:31.360
 war. Right. From 1914 to 1917, there is a searing debate across the political spectrum. It doesn't

18:31.360 --> 18:37.520
 break down easily on party lines about whether it was in the US interest to do this, whether American

18:37.520 --> 18:45.280
 troops should be sent abroad, whether Americans would end up just being cannon fodder for the

18:45.280 --> 18:54.240
 European empires. Eventually, as American ships are sunk, first in the Lusitania in 1915, then in

18:54.240 --> 19:01.040
 much greater numbers in 1917, the tide starts to turn and Americans feel that our response is

19:01.040 --> 19:07.280
 necessary. And the actual declaration of war in Congress is pretty lopsided, but it's not unanimous

19:07.280 --> 19:14.560
 by any means. Lopsided towards entering the war. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's really interesting

19:15.840 --> 19:24.240
 because there's echoes of that in later wars where Congress seems to... Nobody wants to be the guy

19:24.240 --> 19:31.280
 that says no to war for some reason. Once you sense that in terms of, sorry, in terms of

19:31.280 --> 19:37.920
 politicians, because then you appear weak, but I wonder if that was always the case. So you make

19:37.920 --> 19:45.280
 the case that World War I is largely responsible for defining what it means to be an American

19:45.280 --> 19:53.520
 citizen. So in which way does it define the American citizen? When you think about citizenship,

19:53.520 --> 19:58.000
 what it means is two things. First of all, what are your rights and obligations? What

19:58.000 --> 20:04.320
 is the legal citizenship that you have as a citizen of the United States or any other state?

20:05.360 --> 20:11.280
 And the second is a more amorphous definition of what does it mean to belong, to be part of America,

20:11.280 --> 20:18.800
 to feel American, to love it or hate it or be willing to die for it. And both of those things

20:18.800 --> 20:25.040
 really are crystal clear in terms of their importance during the war. So both of those

20:25.040 --> 20:32.240
 things are on the table. Being a citizen who is a citizen who isn't matters. So people who had

20:32.240 --> 20:38.800
 never carried passports or anything before suddenly have to. But also what it means to

20:38.800 --> 20:45.760
 be an American, to feel like it, to be part of this project is also being defined and enforced

20:45.760 --> 20:53.760
 during World War I. So project is a funny way to put a global war. So can you tell the story,

20:53.760 --> 21:02.480
 perhaps that's a good example of it, of the James Montgomery Flagg's 1916 poster that reads,

21:02.480 --> 21:09.440
 I want you. A lot of people know this poster. I think in its original form, its memeified form,

21:09.440 --> 21:14.560
 I don't know. But we know this poster and we don't know where it came from. Or most Americans,

21:14.560 --> 21:19.920
 I think, me included, didn't know where it came from. And it actually comes from 1916.

21:19.920 --> 21:27.200
 Does this poster represent the birth of something new in America, which is a

21:29.520 --> 21:35.200
 commodification or, I don't know, that propaganda machine that says what it

21:35.200 --> 21:39.120
 means to be an American is somebody that fights for their country?

21:40.240 --> 21:46.080
 Yeah. So the image, it's in fact, I think one of the most recognizable images, not only in the

21:46.080 --> 21:53.040
 United States, but in the entire world. And you can bring it almost anywhere on Earth in 2022,

21:53.600 --> 22:00.240
 and people will know what it refers to. And so this is an image that circulated first as a magazine

22:00.240 --> 22:06.160
 cover, later as a recruitment poster, where the figure is Uncle Sam, sort of pointing at the

22:06.160 --> 22:11.920
 viewer with his finger, sort of pointing and saying, I want you. And the I want you is a

22:11.920 --> 22:20.320
 recruitment tool to join the US Army. And this image really kind of starts as a kind of, like I

22:20.320 --> 22:27.040
 said, a magazine cover in 1916 by the artist James Montgomery Flagg. It initially appears under the

22:27.040 --> 22:32.560
 heading, What are you doing for preparedness? Meaning to prepare in case war comes to the

22:32.560 --> 22:40.800
 United States. And at that point in 1916, we're still neutral. In 1917, it's turned into a US

22:40.800 --> 22:47.920
 Army recruiting poster. And then it reappears in World War Two, reappears generations after,

22:47.920 --> 22:57.280
 like you said, it's now gets remixed, memefied, it's all over the place. I think for me, it's a

22:57.280 --> 23:02.240
 turning point, it's a sort of window into American culture at a crucial moment in our history,

23:03.280 --> 23:07.920
 where the federal government is now embarking on a war overseas that's going to make enormous

23:07.920 --> 23:15.120
 demands on its citizens. And at the same time, where sort of technologies of mass production

23:15.120 --> 23:22.000
 and mass media, and what we would probably call propaganda, are being sort of mobilized for the

23:22.000 --> 23:27.680
 for the first time in this new kind of way. Well, in some sense, is it fair to say that

23:28.240 --> 23:36.160
 the Empire is born? The expanding Empire is born from the Noam Chomsky perspective kind of empire

23:36.160 --> 23:41.120
 that seeks to have military influence elsewhere in the world?

23:41.120 --> 23:47.200
 Yes, but I think as historians, we need to be at least as interested in what happens to the people

23:47.200 --> 23:52.640
 who are getting pointed to by Uncle Sam, right, rather than just the one, you know, whether he's

23:52.640 --> 23:58.480
 pointing at us. And, you know, so, so yes, he's asking us to do that. But how do we respond?

23:58.480 --> 24:05.920
 And the people responded. So the people are ultimately the the machines of history, the

24:05.920 --> 24:10.800
 mechanisms of history. It's not Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam can only do so much if the people aren't

24:10.800 --> 24:14.960
 willing to step up. Absolutely. They and, you know, the American people responded for sure,

24:14.960 --> 24:21.280
 but they didn't build what Uncle Sam asked them to do in that poster, right? And I think that's,

24:21.280 --> 24:26.880
 you know, kind of a crucial aspect that, you know, there never would have been sort of global

24:26.880 --> 24:30.640
 U.S. power without the response that begins in World War One.

24:30.640 --> 24:33.440
 What was the Selective Service Act of 1917?

24:34.240 --> 24:38.640
 So one of the very first things that Uncle Sam wants you to do, right, is to register for

24:38.640 --> 24:44.240
 selective service for the draft, right? And the law is passed very soon after the U.S. enters the

24:44.240 --> 24:51.760
 war. It's sort of, you know, demanding that all men first between 21 and 30, then between 18 and

24:51.760 --> 24:58.560
 45, register for the draft, and they'll be selected by a government agency, by a volunteer

24:58.560 --> 25:03.920
 organization. It's a requirement to sign up. It is a legal requirement to register. Of course,

25:03.920 --> 25:10.480
 not everyone who registers is selected, but over the course of the war, 24 million men register,

25:10.480 --> 25:13.280
 almost 4 million serve in some fashion.

25:13.280 --> 25:18.000
 What was the response? What was the feeling amongst the American people to have to sign up

25:18.000 --> 25:22.080
 to the Selective Service Act? Have to register.

25:22.080 --> 25:28.720
 Yeah. This is a bigger turning point than we might think, right? In some ways, this is a tougher

25:28.720 --> 25:33.200
 demand of the American public than entering the war. It's one thing to declare war on Germany,

25:33.760 --> 25:39.840
 right? It's another thing to go down to your local post office and fill out the forms that allow

25:39.840 --> 25:45.680
 your own government to send you there to fight. And this is especially important at a time when

25:45.680 --> 25:52.000
 the federal government doesn't really have any other way to find you unless you actually go

25:52.000 --> 25:58.160
 and register yourself, right? And so, you know, ordinary people are participating in the building

25:58.160 --> 26:04.560
 of this war machine, but at least a half a million of them don't, right? And simply never fill out

26:04.560 --> 26:07.280
 the forms, move from one town to another.

26:07.280 --> 26:09.840
 But you said 20 million did? 20 something?

26:09.840 --> 26:13.520
 Yeah. About 24 million register, at least 500,000.

26:13.520 --> 26:18.240
 Is it surprising to you that that many registered? Since the country was divided?

26:18.240 --> 26:23.840
 It is. And that's what I, you know, sort of tried to dig in to figure out how did you get 24 million

26:23.840 --> 26:29.760
 people to register for the draft? And it's certainly not coming from the top down, right? You

26:29.760 --> 26:35.920
 know, there may be a hundred sort of agents in what's now called the FBI. You know, it's certainly

26:35.920 --> 26:41.360
 not being enforced from Washington. It's being enforced in, you know, through the eyes of everyday

26:41.360 --> 26:45.680
 neighbors, you know, through community surveillance, all kinds of ways.

26:45.680 --> 26:48.080
 Oh, so there was like a pressure.

26:48.080 --> 26:49.760
 There's a lot of pressure.

26:49.760 --> 26:57.440
 Interesting. So there was not a significant like antiwar movement as you would see maybe

26:57.440 --> 26:59.920
 later with Vietnam and things like this?

26:59.920 --> 27:07.280
 There was a significant movement before 1917, but it becomes very hard to keep up an organized

27:07.280 --> 27:11.760
 antiwar movement after that, particularly when the government starts shutting down protests.

27:11.760 --> 27:20.800
 So as the Selective Service Act of 1917 runs up against some of the freedoms, some of the rights

27:20.800 --> 27:30.160
 that are defined in our founding documents, what was that clash like? What was sacrificed? What

27:30.160 --> 27:33.520
 freedoms and rights were sacrificed in this process?

27:33.520 --> 27:40.480
 I mean, I think on some level, the fundamental right is liberty, right? That conscription sort

27:40.480 --> 27:48.880
 of demands, you know, sacrifice on the behalf of some notionally for the protection of all.

27:48.880 --> 27:52.160
 So even if you're against the war, you're forced to fight.

27:52.160 --> 27:59.280
 Yes. You know, and there were small provisions for conscientious objectors, solely those who

27:59.280 --> 28:05.520
 had religious objections to all war, right? Not political objections to this war. And so,

28:05.520 --> 28:11.360
 you know, several thousand were able to take those provisions. But even then, they faced

28:11.360 --> 28:17.520
 social sanction, they faced ridicule, some of them faced intimidation. So those liberty

28:17.520 --> 28:21.840
 interests, both individual freedom, religious freedom, you know, those are some of the first

28:21.840 --> 28:24.320
 things to go.

28:24.320 --> 28:32.480
 Right. So what about freedom of speech? What's the silencing of the press, of the voices

28:32.480 --> 28:34.960
 of the different people that were object?

28:34.960 --> 28:39.280
 Yes, absolutely. Right. And so very soon after the Selective Service Act is passed, then

28:39.280 --> 28:43.920
 you get the Espionage Act, which of course is back in the news in 2022.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.200
 What's the Espionage Act?

28:45.200 --> 28:49.440
 The Espionage Act is a sort of omnibus bill. It contains about 10 or different provisions,

28:49.440 --> 28:55.920
 very few of which have to do with espionage. But one key provision basically makes it illegal

28:55.920 --> 29:02.080
 to say or do anything that would interfere with military recruitment, right? And that

29:02.080 --> 29:08.800
 provision is used to shut down radical publications, to shut down German language publications.

29:08.800 --> 29:14.240
 And, you know, this really has a chilling impact on speech during the war.

29:14.240 --> 29:20.320
 Could you put into words what it means to be an American citizen that is in part sparked

29:20.320 --> 29:30.320
 by World War I? What does that mean? Somebody that should be willing to sacrifice certain

29:30.320 --> 29:39.040
 freedoms to fight for their country? Somebody that's willing to fight to spread freedom

29:39.040 --> 29:46.320
 elsewhere in the world, spread the American ideals? Does that begin to tell the story

29:46.320 --> 29:47.520
 what it means to be an American?

29:49.440 --> 29:55.040
 I think what we see is a change, right? So citizenship during World War I now includes

29:56.400 --> 30:03.600
 the obligation to defend the country, right, to serve, and to, if asked, to die for it,

30:03.600 --> 30:11.200
 right? And we certainly see that. And I think we see the close linkage of military service

30:11.200 --> 30:16.960
 and US citizenship coming out of this time period. But, you know, when you start making

30:16.960 --> 30:22.000
 lots of demands on people to fulfill obligations, in turn, they're going to start demanding rights.

30:22.880 --> 30:28.400
 And we start to see, not necessarily during the war but after, more demands for free speech

30:28.400 --> 30:34.800
 protections, more demands for equality, for marginalized groups. And so, you know, obligations

30:34.800 --> 30:38.240
 and rights are sort of developing in a dynamic relationship.

30:38.240 --> 30:45.920
 Oh, it's almost like an overreach of power sparked a sense like, oh crap, we can't trust

30:45.920 --> 30:51.760
 centralized power to abuse, like to drag us into a war. We need to be able to. So there's

30:52.320 --> 30:55.280
 the birth of that tension between the government and the people.

30:55.280 --> 31:01.280
 It's a rebirth of it. You know, of course, that tension is always there. But in its modern form,

31:01.280 --> 31:06.800
 I think it comes from this reintensification of it. So what about, you said that World War I gave

31:06.800 --> 31:10.080
 birth to the surveillance state in the US. Can you explain?

31:10.960 --> 31:18.080
 Yeah, so the Espionage Act, you know, sort of empowers federal organizations to watch other

31:18.080 --> 31:24.880
 Americans. They are particularly interested in anyone who is obstructing the draft, anyone who

31:24.880 --> 31:32.080
 is trying to kind of organize labor or strikes or radical movements, and anyone who might have

31:32.080 --> 31:37.360
 sympathy for Germany, which basically means, you know, all German Americans come under surveillance.

31:38.080 --> 31:45.120
 Initially, you know, this is very small scale. But soon, every government agency gets involved

31:45.120 --> 31:50.720
 from the Treasury Department Secret Service to the Post Office, which is sort of breeding mail,

31:50.720 --> 31:56.640
 to the Justice Department, which mobilizes 200,000 volunteers. You know, it's a really

31:56.640 --> 32:02.400
 significant enterprise. Much of it goes away after the war. But of all the things that go away,

32:02.400 --> 32:07.760
 this core of the surveillance state is the thing that persists most fully.

32:08.640 --> 32:14.800
 Is this also a place where government, the size of government starts to grow

32:14.800 --> 32:19.600
 in these different organizations, or maybe creates a momentum for growth of government?

32:19.600 --> 32:25.520
 Oh, it's exponential growth, right? That, you know, that over the course of the war,

32:26.240 --> 32:30.880
 by almost any metric you use, right, the size of the federal budget, the number of federal

32:30.880 --> 32:35.360
 employees, the number of soldiers in the standing army, all of those things skyrocket during the

32:35.360 --> 32:40.160
 war. They go down after the war, but they never go down to what they were before.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.840
 And probably gave a momentum for growth.

32:44.640 --> 32:45.600
 Yes, absolutely.

32:45.600 --> 32:52.080
 Did World War I give birth to the military industrial complex in the United States? So,

32:54.240 --> 32:59.600
 war profiteering, expanding of the war machine in order to

33:00.160 --> 33:03.280
 financially benefit a lot of parties involved?

33:04.240 --> 33:11.680
 So, I guess I would maybe break that into two parts, right? That, on the one hand, yes,

33:11.680 --> 33:18.800
 there is war profiteering. There are investigations of it. In the years after the war,

33:18.800 --> 33:26.480
 there's a widespread concern that the profit motive had played too much of a part in the war,

33:26.480 --> 33:32.080
 and that's definitely the case. But I think when you try to think of this term military industrial

33:32.080 --> 33:39.280
 complex, it's best to think of it as, at what point does the one side lock in the other,

33:39.280 --> 33:47.120
 right? That military choices are shaped by industry objectives and vice versa. And I don't

33:47.120 --> 33:51.440
 think that that was fully locked into place during World War I. I think that's really a

33:51.440 --> 33:57.360
 Cold War phenomenon, when the United States is on this intense kind of footing for two

33:57.360 --> 33:58.560
 generations in a row.

33:58.560 --> 34:03.680
 So, industrial is really important there, there is companies. So, before then,

34:03.680 --> 34:10.560
 weapons of war were created, were funded directly by the government. Who was manufacturing the

34:10.560 --> 34:11.600
 weapons of war?

34:12.320 --> 34:18.720
 They were generally manufactured by private industry. There were, of course, arsenals,

34:18.720 --> 34:23.040
 sort of 19th century iterations where the government would produce its own weapons,

34:23.040 --> 34:29.280
 partly to make sure that they got what they wanted. But most of the weapons of war for all

34:29.280 --> 34:33.840
 of the European powers, and the United States, are produced by private industry.

34:33.840 --> 34:38.160
 So, why do you say that the military industrial complex didn't start then? What was the

34:39.040 --> 34:41.120
 important thing that happened in the Cold War?

34:41.920 --> 34:48.320
 I think one way to think about it is that the Cold War is a point at which it switches

34:48.320 --> 34:54.160
 from being a dial to a ratchet, right? So, during World War I, the relationship between

34:54.160 --> 35:01.840
 the military and industry dials up fast and high, and stays that way, and it dials back

35:01.840 --> 35:07.680
 down. Whereas during the Cold War, sort of the relationship between the two often looks

35:07.680 --> 35:08.560
 more like a ratchet.

35:08.560 --> 35:10.320
 Yeah, it becomes unstoppable.

35:10.320 --> 35:11.360
 It goes up again.

35:12.240 --> 35:17.600
 In the way that you start, I think, the way the military industrial complex is often

35:17.600 --> 35:29.280
 discussed as a system that is unstoppable, like it expands. If you take a very cynical

35:29.280 --> 35:39.840
 view, it creates war so that it can make money. It doesn't just find places where it can help

35:39.840 --> 35:49.440
 through military conflict. It creates tensions that directly or indirectly lead to military

35:49.440 --> 35:53.600
 conflict that it can then fuel and make money from.

35:53.600 --> 36:01.360
 That is certainly one of the concerns of both people who are critical of the First

36:01.360 --> 36:05.920
 World War, and then also of Dwight Eisenhower, right, when he's president and sort of in

36:05.920 --> 36:11.360
 his farewell address, where he sort of introduces the term military industrial complex. And

36:11.360 --> 36:16.960
 some of it is about the profit motive, but some of it is a fear that Eisenhower had that

36:16.960 --> 36:22.560
 no one had an interest in stopping this, right, and that no one had a voice in stopping it,

36:22.560 --> 36:31.120
 and that the ordinary American could really do nothing to dial things down.

36:31.120 --> 36:39.920
 Is it strange to you that we don't often hear that kind of speech today, with Eisenhower

36:39.920 --> 36:45.680
 speaking about the military industrial complex? For example, we'll have people criticizing

36:45.680 --> 36:55.040
 the spending on war efforts, but they're not discussing the machinery of the military industrial

36:55.040 --> 37:02.480
 complex, like the basic way that human nature works, that we get ourselves trapped in this

37:02.480 --> 37:07.760
 thing. They're saying, like, there's better things to spend money on, versus describing

37:07.760 --> 37:15.040
 a very seemingly natural process of when you build weapons of war that's going to lead

37:15.040 --> 37:19.520
 to more war. Like, it pulls you in somehow.

37:19.520 --> 37:27.120
 RW. Yeah, I would say throughout the Cold War, and even after the end of it, there has

37:27.120 --> 37:35.600
 not been a sustained conversation in the United States about our defense establishment, right,

37:35.600 --> 37:46.960
 what we really need, and what serves our interest, and to what extent sort of other things like

37:46.960 --> 37:53.600
 blanket forces, profit motives, belong in that conversation. What's interesting is that

37:53.600 --> 37:59.040
 in the generation after the First World War, that conversation was on the table, right,

37:59.040 --> 38:03.920
 through a series of investigations in the US, the Nye Committee in Britain, the Royal

38:03.920 --> 38:10.240
 Commission, journalistic exposés. This would have been just talked about constantly in

38:10.240 --> 38:16.440
 the years between about 1930 and 1936, as people were starting to worry that storm clouds

38:16.440 --> 38:18.240
 were gathering in Europe again.

38:18.240 --> 38:26.360
 LR. Yeah, but it always seems like those folks get pushed to the fringes. You're made an

38:26.360 --> 38:32.480
 activist versus a thinking leader.

38:32.480 --> 38:40.680
 RW. Those discussions are often marginalized, framed as conspiracy theory, etc. I think

38:40.680 --> 38:47.640
 it's important to realize that in the generation after World War I, this was a serious civic

38:47.640 --> 38:55.520
 conversation. It led to investigations of defense finance. It led to experiments in

38:55.520 --> 39:01.200
 Britain and France in public finance of war material. I think those conversations need

39:01.200 --> 39:04.880
 to be reconvened now in the 21st century.

39:04.880 --> 39:12.060
 LR. Is there any parallels between World War I and the war in Ukraine? The reason I bring

39:12.060 --> 39:23.720
 it up is because you mentioned there was a hunger for war, a capacity for war that was

39:23.720 --> 39:31.000
 already established, and the different parties were just boiling the tensions. So there's

39:31.000 --> 39:36.800
 a case made that America had a role to play, NATO had a role to play in the current war

39:36.800 --> 39:44.240
 in Ukraine. Is there some truth to that when you think about it in the context of World

39:44.240 --> 39:51.680
 War I? Or is it purely about the specific parties involved, which is Russia and Ukraine?

39:51.680 --> 40:02.240
 RW. I think it's very easy to draw parallels between World War I and the war in Ukraine,

40:02.240 --> 40:14.760
 but I don't think they really work. The First World War in some ways is generated by a fundamental

40:14.760 --> 40:22.320
 conflict in the European system of empires, in the global system of empires. In many ways,

40:22.320 --> 40:29.800
 if there's a parallel, the war in Ukraine is the parallel to some of the conflicts in

40:29.800 --> 40:40.540
 the Mediterranean and the Balkans in 1911 to 1913, that then later there was a much

40:40.540 --> 40:48.440
 greater conflict. So I think if there's any lessons to be learned for how not to let World

40:48.440 --> 40:55.000
 War III look like World War I, it would be to make sure that systems aren't locked into

40:55.000 --> 40:58.880
 place that escalate wars out of people's expectations.

40:58.880 --> 41:17.200
 LR. That's I suppose what I was implying, that this is the early stages of World War III. That in the same way that several wolves are licking their chops or whatever the expression is, they're creating tension, they're

41:17.200 --> 41:29.280
 creating military conflict with a kind of unstoppable imperative for a global war. Many people that

41:29.280 --> 41:36.920
 are looking at this are really worried about that. Now the forcing function to stop this

41:36.920 --> 41:42.880
 war is that there's several nuclear powers involved, which has at least for now worked

41:42.880 --> 41:49.080
 to stop full on global war. But I'm not sure that's going to be the case. In fact, what

41:49.080 --> 41:58.680
 is one of the surprising things to me in Ukraine is that still in the 21st century, we can

41:58.680 --> 42:05.960
 go to something that involves nuclear powers, not directly yet, but awfully close to directly,

42:05.960 --> 42:14.440
 go to a hot war. And so do you worry about that, that there's a kind of descent into

42:14.440 --> 42:16.720
 a World War I type of scenario?

42:16.720 --> 42:22.640
 RW. Yes, I mean, that keeps me up at night, and I think it should keep the citizens of

42:22.640 --> 42:31.640
 both the United States and Russia up at night. And I think, again, it gets back to what I

42:31.640 --> 42:40.720
 was saying, that in the summer of 1914, even then, things that looked like a march toward

42:40.720 --> 42:49.260
 war could have been different. And so I think it's important for leaders of both countries

42:49.260 --> 42:56.760
 and of all of the related countries, of Ukraine, of the various NATO powers, to really imagine

42:56.760 --> 43:04.800
 off ramps and to imagine alternatives and to make them possible. Whether it's through

43:04.800 --> 43:13.440
 diplomacy, whether it's through other formats, I think that that's the only way to prevent

43:13.440 --> 43:14.840
 sort of greater escalation.

43:14.840 --> 43:19.120
 LR. What's the difference between World War I and the Civil War? In terms of how they

43:19.120 --> 43:25.960
 defined what it means to be an American, but also the American citizen's relationship with

43:25.960 --> 43:34.880
 the war, what the leaders were doing, is there interesting differences and similarities?

43:34.880 --> 43:38.400
 Besides the fact that everybody seems to have forgot about World War I in the United States

43:38.400 --> 43:40.520
 and everyone still remembers Civil War.

43:40.520 --> 43:50.720
 RW. I mean, it's true. And the American Civil War defines American identity in some ways,

43:50.720 --> 43:57.160
 along with the Revolution and the Second World War, more so than any other conflict. And

43:57.160 --> 44:06.120
 it's a fundamentally different war. It's won because it is a civil war, because of secession,

44:06.120 --> 44:12.800
 because of the Confederacy. This is a conflict happening on the territory of the United States

44:12.800 --> 44:20.480
 between Americans. And so the dynamics are really quite different. So the leaders particularly

44:20.480 --> 44:27.760
 Lincoln have a different relationship to the home front, to civilians, than they say Wilson

44:27.760 --> 44:30.040
 or Roosevelt have in World War I and II.

44:30.040 --> 44:34.720
 LR. Also the way you would tell the story of the Civil War, perhaps similar to the way

44:34.720 --> 44:40.200
 we tell the story of World War II, there's like a reason to actually fight the war. The

44:40.200 --> 44:45.000
 way we tell the story is we're fighting for this idea that all men are created equal,

44:45.000 --> 44:54.520
 that the war is over slavery in part. Perhaps that's a drastic oversimplification of what

44:54.520 --> 44:58.940
 the war was actually about in the moment, like how do you get pulled into an actual

44:58.940 --> 45:07.840
 war versus a hot discussion. And the same with World War II, people kind of framed the

45:07.840 --> 45:15.820
 narrative that it was against evil, Hitler being evil. I think the key part of that is

45:15.820 --> 45:22.840
 probably the Holocaust, is how you can formulate Hitler's being evil. If there's no Holocaust,

45:22.840 --> 45:28.400
 perhaps there's a case to be made that we wouldn't see World War II as such a quote

45:28.400 --> 45:35.680
 unquote good war, that there's an atrocity that had to happen to make it really, to be

45:35.680 --> 45:40.260
 able to tell a clear narrative of why we get into this war. Perhaps such a narrative doesn't

45:40.260 --> 45:46.060
 exist for World War I, and so that doesn't stay in the American mind. We try to sweep

45:46.060 --> 45:54.720
 it under the rug, given though overall 16 million people died. So to you the difference

45:54.720 --> 46:02.240
 is in the fact that you're fighting for ideas and fighting on the homeland. But in terms

46:02.240 --> 46:10.480
 of people's participation, you know, fighting for your country, was there similarities there?

46:10.480 --> 46:17.840
 Yeah. I mean, I think, I mean the Civil War in both the North and the South, troops are

46:17.840 --> 46:24.040
 raised overwhelmingly through volunteer recruitment. There is a draft in both the North and the

46:24.040 --> 46:35.160
 South, but it's not significant. Only 8% of Confederate soldiers came in through conscription.

46:35.160 --> 46:44.060
 And so in fact, the mobilization for volunteers often organized locally around individual

46:44.060 --> 46:50.800
 communities or states, creates sort of multiple identities and levels of loyalty, where people

46:50.800 --> 46:55.840
 both in the North and the South have loyalty both to their state regiments, to their sort

46:55.840 --> 47:01.500
 of community militias and as well to the country. They are fighting over the country, right?

47:01.500 --> 47:07.280
 Over the United States. And so the Union and the Confederacy have conflicting and ultimately

47:07.280 --> 47:15.680
 irreconcilable visions of that. But that sort of nationalism that comes out of the Union

47:15.680 --> 47:21.660
 after the victory in the war is a kind of crucial force shaping America ever since.

47:21.660 --> 47:26.320
 So what was the neutrality period? Why did US stay out of the war for so long? What was

47:26.320 --> 47:36.120
 going on in that interesting, like, what made Woodrow Wilson change his mind? What was the

47:36.120 --> 47:38.520
 interesting dynamic there?

47:38.520 --> 47:45.520
 I always say that the United States entered the war in April of 1917, but Americans entered

47:45.520 --> 47:50.860
 it right away, right? They entered it. Some of them actually went and volunteered and

47:50.860 --> 47:59.380
 fought almost exclusively on the side of Britain and France. At least 50,000 joined the Canadian

47:59.380 --> 48:06.160
 army or the British army and served. Millions volunteer. They sent humanitarian aid. I think

48:06.160 --> 48:13.920
 in many ways, modern war creates modern humanitarianism, and we can see that in the neutrality period.

48:13.920 --> 48:18.920
 And even if they wanted the United States to stay out of the war, a lot of Americans

48:18.920 --> 48:25.640
 get involved in it by thinking about it, caring about it, arguing about it. And at the same

48:25.640 --> 48:32.840
 time, they're worried that British propaganda is shaping their news system. They are worried

48:32.840 --> 48:37.640
 that German espionage is undermining them. They're worried that both Britain and Germany

48:37.640 --> 48:43.600
 are trying to interfere in American elections and American news cycles. And at the same

48:43.600 --> 48:49.760
 time, a revolution is breaking out in Mexico. So there are sort of concerns about what's

48:49.760 --> 48:54.200
 happening in the Western Hemisphere as well as what's happening in Europe.

48:54.200 --> 49:02.520
 So World War I was supposed to be the war to end all wars, and it didn't. How did World

49:02.520 --> 49:09.960
 War I pave the way to World War II? Every nation probably has their own story in this

49:09.960 --> 49:16.520
 trajectory towards World War II. How did Europe allow World War II to happen? How did the

49:16.520 --> 49:22.480
 Soviet Union, Russia allow World War II to happen, and how did America allow World War

49:22.480 --> 49:24.520
 II to happen? And Japan?

49:24.520 --> 49:29.320
 Yeah, you're right. The answer is different for each country, right? That in some ways

49:29.320 --> 49:35.680
 in Germany, the culture of defeat and the experience of defeat at the end of World War

49:35.680 --> 49:45.280
 I leads to a culture of resentment, recrimination, finger pointing blame that makes German politics

49:45.280 --> 49:50.920
 very ugly. As one person puts it, brutalizes German politics.

49:50.920 --> 49:56.440
 It places resentment at the core of the populace and its politics.

49:56.440 --> 50:02.280
 Yeah. And so in some ways, that lays the groundwork for the kind of politics of resentment and

50:02.280 --> 50:09.120
 hate that comes from the Nazis. For the United States, in some ways, the failure to win the

50:09.120 --> 50:18.840
 peace sets up the possibility for the next war, that the United States, through Wilson,

50:18.840 --> 50:23.800
 is sort of crafting a new international order in order that this will be the war to end

50:23.800 --> 50:30.200
 all wars. But because the United States failed to join the League of Nations, you see the

50:30.200 --> 50:34.360
 United States really sort of on the hook for another generation.

50:34.360 --> 50:38.320
 In Asia, the story is more complicated, right? And I think it's worth bearing that in mind

50:38.320 --> 50:45.420
 that World War II is a two front war. It starts in Asia for its own reasons. World War I is

50:45.420 --> 50:51.960
 transformative for Japan, right? It is a time of massive economic expansion. A lot of that

50:51.960 --> 50:58.900
 sort of economic wealth is poured into sort of greater industrialization and militarization.

50:58.900 --> 51:04.640
 And so when the military wing in Japanese politics takes over in the 1930s, they're

51:04.640 --> 51:09.760
 in some ways flexing muscles that come out of the First World War.

51:09.760 --> 51:15.880
 Can you talk about the end of World War I, the Treaty of Versailles? What's interesting

51:15.880 --> 51:24.640
 about that dynamics there, of the parties involved, of how it could have been done differently

51:24.640 --> 51:30.380
 to avoid the resentment? Or again, is it inevitable?

51:30.380 --> 51:38.120
 So the war ends and very soon, even before the war is over, the United States in particular

51:38.120 --> 51:43.440
 is trying to shape the peace, right? And the United States is the central actor at the

51:43.440 --> 51:49.680
 Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Woodrow Wilson is there, he's presiding, and he knows that

51:49.680 --> 51:51.000
 he calls the shots.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.960
 So he was respected.

51:52.960 --> 51:59.920
 He was respected, but resentfully in some ways by the European powers, Britain and France

51:59.920 --> 52:06.720
 and Italy to a lesser extent, who felt that they had sacrificed more. They had two goals,

52:06.720 --> 52:13.160
 right? They wanted to shape the imperial system in order to make sure that their kind of fundamental

52:13.160 --> 52:19.100
 economic structures wouldn't change. And they also wanted to sort of weaken Germany as much

52:19.100 --> 52:23.100
 as possible, right? So that Germany couldn't rise again.

52:23.100 --> 52:30.000
 What this leads to is a peace treaty that maintains some of the fundamental conflicts

52:30.000 --> 52:37.020
 of the imperial system and makes, bankrupts Germany, starves Germany, and kind of feeds

52:37.020 --> 52:44.560
 this politics of resentment that make it impossible for Germany to kind of participate in a European

52:44.560 --> 52:46.480
 order.

52:46.480 --> 52:53.560
 So people like historian Neil Ferguson, for example, make the case that if Britain stayed

52:53.560 --> 52:58.920
 out of World War I, we would have avoided this whole mess and we would potentially even

52:58.920 --> 53:06.560
 avoid World War II, this kind of counterfactual history. Do you think it's possible to make

53:06.560 --> 53:12.520
 the case for that? That there was a moment, especially in that case, staying out of the

53:12.520 --> 53:17.520
 war for Britain, that the escalation to a global war could have been avoided and one

53:17.520 --> 53:24.480
 that ultimately ends in a deep global resentment. So where Germany is resentful not just of

53:24.480 --> 53:30.400
 France or particular nations, but is resentful of the entire, I don't know how you define

53:30.400 --> 53:36.520
 it, the West or something like this, the entire global world.

53:36.520 --> 53:49.200
 I wish it were that easy. And I think it's useful to think in counterfactuals. What if?

53:49.200 --> 53:57.260
 And if you believe, as historians do, in causation, if that one thing causes another, then you

53:57.260 --> 54:01.720
 also have to believe in counterfactuals, right? That if something hadn't happened, then maybe

54:01.720 --> 54:09.720
 that would have worked differently. But I think all the things that led to World War

54:09.720 --> 54:16.640
 I are multi causal and nuanced. And this is what historians do. We make things more complicated.

54:16.640 --> 54:27.240
 And so there was no one thing that could have turned the tide of history. Oh, if only Hitler

54:27.240 --> 54:34.080
 had gotten into art school or if only Fidel Castro had gotten into the major leagues.

54:34.080 --> 54:38.000
 Those are interesting thought experiments, but few events in history I think are that

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
 contingent.

54:39.000 --> 54:45.600
 Well, Hitler is an example of somebody who is a charismatic leader that seems to have

54:45.600 --> 54:55.760
 a really disproportionate amount of influence on the tide of history. So if you look at

54:55.760 --> 55:03.200
 Stalin, you could imagine that many other people could have stepped into that role.

55:03.200 --> 55:09.760
 And the same goes for many of the other presidents through, or even Mao. It seems that there's

55:09.760 --> 55:15.440
 a singular nature to Hitler, that you could play the counterfactual, that if there was

55:15.440 --> 55:22.680
 no Hitler, you may have not had World War II. He better than many leaders in history

55:22.680 --> 55:28.560
 was able to channel the resentment of the populace into a very aggressive expansion

55:28.560 --> 55:36.600
 of the military and I would say skillful deceit of the entire world in terms of his plans

55:36.600 --> 55:44.720
 and was able to effectively start the war. So is it possible that, I mean, could Hitler

55:44.720 --> 55:52.000
 have been stopped? Could we have avoided if he just got into art school? Or again, do

55:52.000 --> 55:55.680
 you feel like there's a current of events that was unstoppable?

55:55.680 --> 56:01.120
 I mean, part of what you're talking about is Hitler the individual as a sort of charismatic

56:01.120 --> 56:08.240
 leader who's able to mobilize the nation. And part of it is Hitlerism, his own sort

56:08.240 --> 56:14.920
 of individual ability to play, for example, play off his subordinates against one another

56:14.920 --> 56:21.640
 to set up a system of that nature that in some ways escalates violence, including the

56:21.640 --> 56:28.640
 violence that leads to the Holocaust. And some of it is also Hitlerism as a leader cult.

56:28.640 --> 56:35.040
 And we see this in many other sort of things where a political movement surrounds one particular

56:35.040 --> 56:42.840
 individual who may or may not be replaceable. So yes, the World War II we got would have

56:42.840 --> 56:51.360
 been completely different if a different sort of faction had risen to power in Germany.

56:51.360 --> 56:56.720
 But Europe, you know, Depression era Europe was so unstable and democracies collapsed

56:56.720 --> 57:01.520
 throughout Western Europe over the course of the 1930s, you know, whether they had charismatic

57:01.520 --> 57:04.560
 totalitarian leaders or not.

57:04.560 --> 57:11.640
 Have you actually read one book I just recently finished? I'd love to get your opinion from

57:11.640 --> 57:16.840
 a historian perspective. There's a book called Blitzed Drugs in the Third Reich by Norman

57:16.840 --> 57:25.360
 Mohler. It makes a case that drugs played a very large role, meth essentially, played

57:25.360 --> 57:32.760
 a very large role in World War II. There's a lot of criticism of this book, saying that

57:32.760 --> 57:38.600
 it's kind of to what you're saying, it takes this one little variable and makes it like

57:38.600 --> 57:44.840
 this explains everything. So everything about Hitler, everything about the blitzkrieg, everything

57:44.840 --> 57:50.720
 about the military, the way the strategy, the decisions could be explained through drugs,

57:50.720 --> 57:56.120
 or at least implies that kind of thing. And the interesting thing about this book because

57:56.120 --> 58:02.000
 Hitler and Nazi Germany is one of the most sort of written about periods of human history.

58:02.000 --> 58:07.760
 And this was not drugs were almost entirely not written about in this context. So here

58:07.760 --> 58:13.880
 come along this semi historian because I don't think he's even a historian. He's a lot of

58:13.880 --> 58:19.600
 his work is fiction. Hopefully I'm saying that correctly. So he tells a really that's

58:19.600 --> 58:27.120
 one of the criticisms he tells a very compelling story that drugs were at the center of this

58:27.120 --> 58:35.680
 period and also of the man of Hitler. What are your sort of feelings and thoughts about

58:35.680 --> 58:39.960
 if you've gotten a chance to read this book, but I'm sure there's books like it that tell

58:39.960 --> 58:45.600
 an interesting perspective singular perspective on a war. Yeah, I mean, I have read it and

58:45.600 --> 58:51.200
 I also had this sort of eye opening experience that a lot of historians did and they're like,

58:51.200 --> 58:58.720
 why didn't, why didn't we think about this? And I think whether he's, the author Oller

58:58.720 --> 59:03.440
 is sort of not a trained academic historian, but the joy of history is like, you don't

59:03.440 --> 59:08.480
 have to be one to write good history. And I don't think anyone sort of criticizes him

59:08.480 --> 59:15.720
 for, for that. Um, I like the book as a, as a window into the third Reich. You know, of

59:15.720 --> 59:22.560
 course drugs don't explain all of it, but it helps us see, um, you know, uh, it see

59:22.560 --> 59:29.320
 helps us see the people who supported Hitler, um, uh, the ways in which, um, you know, uh,

59:29.320 --> 59:34.920
 it was that mind altering and performance altering drugs were used to kind of keep soldiers

59:34.920 --> 59:41.680
 on the battlefield. Um, the ways in which, um, you know, I think that we take, we don't

59:41.680 --> 59:46.680
 fully understand the extent to which the third Reich is held together with like duct tape,

59:46.680 --> 59:53.500
 um, from, um, you know, from a pretty early phase by like 1940 or 41 even, you know, it's

59:53.500 --> 59:59.920
 all smoke and mirrors. And I think that wartime propaganda, both Germans trying to say, you

59:59.920 --> 1:00:05.040
 know, we're winning everything and America trying to mobilize, uh, and the other allies,

1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:10.240
 you know, to mobilize against Germany, uh, described a more formidable enemy than it

1:00:10.240 --> 1:00:12.440
 really was by 1941 and 42.

1:00:12.440 --> 1:00:19.400
 Yeah. I mean, I could see both cases. Uh, one is that duct tape doesn't make the man,

1:00:19.400 --> 1:00:24.680
 but also as an engineer, I'm a huge fan of duct tape because it does seem to solve a

1:00:24.680 --> 1:00:32.200
 lot of problems. And, uh, I do worry that this perspective that the book presents about

1:00:32.200 --> 1:00:39.520
 drugs is somehow to the mind really compelling because it's almost like the mind, or at least

1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:44.760
 my mind searches for an answer. How could this have happened? And it's nice to have

1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:50.680
 a clean explanation and drugs is one popular one. When people talk about steroids and sports,

1:00:50.680 --> 1:00:56.400
 the moment you introduced the topic of steroids, somehow the mind wants to explain all success

1:00:56.400 --> 1:01:04.320
 in the context was because this person was on steroids, Lance Armstrong. Well, it's,

1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:09.360
 it like, it's a very sticky idea. Certain ideas, certain explanations are very sticky.

1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:13.520
 And I think that's really dangerous because then you lose the full context. And also in

1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:20.480
 the case of drugs, it removes the responsibility from the person, both for the military genius

1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:27.160
 and the evil. And I think you, I mean, it's a very dangerous thing to do because something

1:01:27.160 --> 1:01:31.440
 about the mind, maybe it's just mind that's sticky to this. Well, drugs explain it. If

1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:37.480
 the drugs didn't happen, uh, then it would be very different. Yeah. It worries me how

1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:42.600
 compelling it is of an explanation, you know? Yeah. So that's why it's maybe better to think

1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:47.320
 of it as a window into the third, right? Is that an explanation of it? But it's also a

1:01:47.320 --> 1:01:52.320
 nice exploration of Hitler, the man. For some reason, discussing his habits, especially

1:01:52.320 --> 1:02:00.000
 later in the war, um, his practices with drugs gives you a window into the person. It reminds

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:06.800
 you that there's a human, this is a human being, like a human being that gets emotional

1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:14.560
 in the morning, gets thoughtful in the morning, hopeful, sad, depressed, angry, like a story

1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:20.940
 of emotions of the human being. Somehow we construct, um, which is a pretty dangerous

1:02:20.940 --> 1:02:26.040
 thing to do, construct an evil monster out of Hitler when in reality he's a human being

1:02:26.040 --> 1:02:30.320
 like all of us. I think the lesson there is the soldier needs to lesson, which is all

1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:38.440
 of us to some degree are capable of evil. Um, or maybe if you want to make it less powerful

1:02:38.440 --> 1:02:45.440
 a statement, many of our leaders are capable of evil. That this Hitler is not truly singular

1:02:45.440 --> 1:02:51.960
 in history. That, uh, yeah, when the resentment of the populace matches the right charismatic

1:02:51.960 --> 1:02:57.280
 leader, it's, it's easy to make the kind of, not easy, but it's possible to frequently

1:02:57.280 --> 1:03:04.480
 make the kind of, uh, initiation of military conflict that happened in World War, World

1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:12.360
 War II. By the way, because you said not a trained historian, one of the, one of the

1:03:12.360 --> 1:03:17.960
 most compelling and I don't know, entertaining and fascinating exploration of World War I

1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:24.180
 comes from Dan Carlin. I don't know if you've gotten a chance to listen to his sort of podcast

1:03:24.180 --> 1:03:29.600
 form telling of the blueprint for Armageddon, which is the telling of World War I. What

1:03:29.600 --> 1:03:34.600
 do you think about Dan Carlin, you yourself as a historian who has studied, who has written

1:03:34.600 --> 1:03:40.960
 about World War I? Do you, do you enjoy that kind of telling of history? Absolutely. And

1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:46.160
 I think, um, again, you know, uh, you don't need a PhD in history to, to be a historian.

1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:50.240
 Um, does every historian agree with that? Uh, he gets quite a bit of criticism from

1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:54.800
 historians. Uh, you know, I mean, we, you know, we like to argue with each other and

1:03:54.800 --> 1:03:58.880
 nitpick with each other, but, um, but the one thing I have no patience for is when we

1:03:58.880 --> 1:04:05.040
 like pull rank on each other. Um, you know, I think, um, we depend on, uh, you know, if

1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:09.880
 you're, you know, a historian in a university with degrees and research materials, you know,

1:04:09.880 --> 1:04:15.120
 you depend on the work of people in some local community, like recording oral histories,

1:04:15.120 --> 1:04:21.120
 saving documents. And history is a, it's a social science, but it's also a storytelling

1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:26.940
 art. Um, and you know, uh, history books are the ones you find on the shelves and bookstores

1:04:26.940 --> 1:04:32.400
 that people read for, for fun. And, and then, and you can appreciate both the, the knowledge

1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:37.720
 production, um, as well as the storytelling. Um, and when you get a good oral storyteller

1:04:37.720 --> 1:04:42.840
 like Dan Carlin, um, there's a reason that thousands and hundreds of thousands of people

1:04:42.840 --> 1:04:48.400
 tune in. Yeah. But he definitely suffers from anxiety about getting things correct. And

1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:52.800
 it's very, it's very difficult. Well, our first job is to get the facts, uh, the facts

1:04:52.800 --> 1:04:58.160
 correct and then, and then to tell the story off of those. But the, the facts are so fuzzy.

1:04:58.160 --> 1:05:05.440
 So it's a, I mean, you have the, probably my favorite telling of World War II is William

1:05:05.440 --> 1:05:12.320
 Shire's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. And, uh, or at least not telling of Nazi Germany.

1:05:12.320 --> 1:05:20.960
 And that goes to primary sources a lot, which is like, I suppose that's the honest way to

1:05:20.960 --> 1:05:26.880
 do it. But it's tough. It's really tough to write that way, to really go to primary sources

1:05:26.880 --> 1:05:34.520
 always. And I think the, one of the things that Dan tries to do, which is also really

1:05:34.520 --> 1:05:41.480
 tough to do, perhaps easier in, in oral history is, uh, try to make you feel what it was like

1:05:41.480 --> 1:05:48.280
 to be there. Which, uh, I think he does by trying to tell the story of like individual

1:05:48.280 --> 1:05:55.960
 soldiers and, um, do you find that telling like individual citizens? Do you find that

1:05:55.960 --> 1:05:58.080
 kind of telling of history compelling?

1:05:58.080 --> 1:06:07.800
 Yeah. I mean, I think we need, uh, historical imagination. Um, and I think historical imagination

1:06:07.800 --> 1:06:15.520
 teaches something very valuable, which is humility, um, to realize that there are other

1:06:15.520 --> 1:06:20.560
 people, um, who've lived on this planet and they organized their lives differently and,

1:06:20.560 --> 1:06:27.760
 you know, they made it through just fine too. Um, and, um, you know, I think that, that,

1:06:27.760 --> 1:06:34.400
 that kind of, of, of meeting other people from the past can be actually a very useful

1:06:34.400 --> 1:06:38.560
 skill for meeting people unlike you in the present.

1:06:38.560 --> 1:06:43.600
 Unlike you, but also like you. I think both are, uh, both are humbling. One realizing

1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:49.280
 that they did live in a different space and time, but two realizing that if you, if you

1:06:49.280 --> 1:06:54.320
 were placed in that space and time, you might have done all the same things, whether it's

1:06:54.320 --> 1:06:57.320
 the brave, good thing or the evil thing.

1:06:57.320 --> 1:07:04.040
 Yeah, absolutely. Um, and you get a, also a sense of, um, uh, of possibility. You know,

1:07:04.040 --> 1:07:07.920
 there's this famous line, right? That, um, you know, those who do not learn history are

1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:12.920
 condemned to repeat it. Um, but I think the other half is true, uh, as well, which is

1:07:12.920 --> 1:07:17.280
 those who do not learn history don't get the chance to repeat it, right? Um, you know,

1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:21.640
 that we're not the first people on this planet to face, you know, any certain kinds of problems.

1:07:21.640 --> 1:07:26.320
 Um, you know, other people have, have lived through worlds like this one before.

1:07:26.320 --> 1:07:29.980
 It's like when you fall in love as a teenager for the first time, there's, and then there's

1:07:29.980 --> 1:07:36.240
 a breakup. You think it, it's the greatest tragedy, tragedy that has ever happened in

1:07:36.240 --> 1:07:43.440
 the world. You're the first person. Even though, like, Romeo and Juliet and so on had, had

1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:49.400
 this issue, you're the first person that truly feels the catastrophic heartbreak of that

1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:55.920
 experience. It's good to be reminded that no, the human condition is what it is. We

1:07:55.920 --> 1:07:59.480
 have lived through it at the individual and the societal scale.

1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:07.400
 Let me ask you about nationalism, which I think is at the core of I want you poster.

1:08:07.400 --> 1:08:13.320
 Is nationalism destructive or empowering to a nation? And we can use different words like

1:08:13.320 --> 1:08:19.960
 patriotism, which is in many ways synonymous to nationalism, but in recent history, perhaps

1:08:19.960 --> 1:08:26.440
 because of the Nazis has, has, um, slowly parted ways that somehow nationalism is when

1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:30.240
 patriotism, patriotism gone bad or something like this.

1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:36.320
 Yeah, they're, they're different, right? Um, patriotism, um, you know, patriotism is in

1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:41.560
 some ways best thought of as an emotion, right? Uh, and a feeling of, of love of country,

1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:47.800
 right? Um, you know, uh, literally, um, uh, and in some ways that's a necessary condition

1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:56.840
 to participate in nationalism. Um, you know, whether to me, I think nationalism is crucial,

1:08:56.840 --> 1:09:04.400
 um, in a world organized around nation states. Um, and you have to sort of believe that you

1:09:04.400 --> 1:09:09.480
 are engaged in a common project together, right? Um, and so, you know, in the contemporary

1:09:09.480 --> 1:09:15.280
 United States, um, you know, uh, in some ways that that question is actually on the table

1:09:15.280 --> 1:09:19.260
 in ways that it hasn't been in the past, but you know, you have to believe that you're

1:09:19.260 --> 1:09:24.240
 engaged in a common project, that you have something in common with the person with whom

1:09:24.240 --> 1:09:29.640
 you share this nation. Um, and, um, and that you would sacrifice for them, whether it's

1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:34.880
 by paying taxes for them or, um, you know, we're going to war to defend them. Um, that's

1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:39.920
 a vision of, you know, what we might call civic nationalism. Um, uh, that's, that's

1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:46.400
 the good version. The question is whether you could have that, um, without having, um,

1:09:46.400 --> 1:09:51.680
 exclusionary nationalism, you know, hating the other, right? Fearing the other saying,

1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:58.240
 uh, yeah, you're part of this nation, uh, against all others. Um, and I think there's

1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:06.600
 a long tradition in America of a very inclusive, uh, nationalism, um, that is open, uh, inclusive,

1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:14.240
 um, and, you know, new people to this shared project. Um, that's something to be defended.

1:10:14.240 --> 1:10:19.880
 Exclusionary nationalism is based on, you know, um, uh, uh, ethnic hatreds and others

1:10:19.880 --> 1:10:24.120
 that we see throughout the world. Um, those are things to be afraid of.

1:10:24.120 --> 1:10:29.840
 But there is a kind of narrative in the United States that a nationalism that includes the

1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:36.240
 big umbrella of democratic nations, nations that strive for freedom and everybody else

1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:41.680
 is against, is against freedom and against human nature. And it just so happens that

1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:48.800
 it's half and half split across the world. So that's imperialism that feels like it beats

1:10:48.800 --> 1:10:51.160
 the drum of war.

1:10:51.160 --> 1:10:55.840
 Yeah. And I, I mean, I don't want to paint too rosy a picture and certainly, you know,

1:10:55.840 --> 1:11:01.360
 the United States, um, as a nation has often found it easier to define ourselves against

1:11:01.360 --> 1:11:06.400
 something than to clarify exactly what we're for.

1:11:06.400 --> 1:11:16.680
 Yeah. Yeah. The Cold War, China today. That's not only United States. I suppose that's,

1:11:16.680 --> 1:11:23.200
 that's human nature. It's, we need a competitor. It's almost like maybe the success of human

1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:31.280
 civilization requires figuring out how to construct competitors that don't result in

1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:32.840
 global war.

1:11:32.840 --> 1:11:41.400
 Yes. Or figuring out how to turn enemies into rivals and competitors. There's a real difference.

1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:47.000
 You know, you can, you, you know, you compete with competitors. You, you fight with enemies.

1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:55.960
 Yeah. With competitors is a respect, maybe even a love underlying the competition.

1:11:55.960 --> 1:12:02.120
 What lessons, what are the biggest lessons you take away from World War I? Maybe we talked

1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:10.480
 about several, but you know, you look back at the 20th century. What, as a historian,

1:12:10.480 --> 1:12:17.160
 what do you learn about human nature, about human civilization, about history from looking

1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:19.480
 at this war?

1:12:19.480 --> 1:12:29.840
 I think the, the lesson I would want everyone to take from the story of the First World

1:12:29.840 --> 1:12:41.320
 War is that human life is not cheap. That all of the warring powers thought that just

1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:48.000
 by throwing more men and more material at the front, they would solve their political

1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:56.620
 problems with military force. And at the end of the day in 1918, one side did win that,

1:12:56.620 --> 1:12:59.560
 but it didn't actually solve any of those political problems.

1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:06.120
 And in the end, the regular people paid the price with their lives.

1:13:06.120 --> 1:13:12.680
 They did. And people who, people who had been told that their lives were cheap remembered

1:13:12.680 --> 1:13:19.440
 that, right? And it sort of, you know, reshapes mass politics for the rest of the 20th century,

1:13:19.440 --> 1:13:21.400
 both in Europe and around the world.

1:13:21.400 --> 1:13:29.000
 Yeah. The, yeah, the cost of a death of a single soldier is not just, or a single civilian

1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:35.520
 is not just the cost of that single life. It's the resentment, that the anger, the hate

1:13:35.520 --> 1:13:42.480
 that reverberates throughout. One of the things I saw in Ukraine is the birth of, at scale

1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:50.320
 of generational hate, not towards administrations or leaders, but towards entire peoples. And

1:13:50.320 --> 1:13:56.520
 that hate, I mean, overnight that hate is created and it takes perhaps decades for that

1:13:56.520 --> 1:13:58.660
 hate to dissipate.

1:13:58.660 --> 1:14:04.960
 It takes decades and it takes, it takes collective effort to build institutions that divert that

1:14:04.960 --> 1:14:10.080
 hate into other places.

1:14:10.080 --> 1:14:16.460
 One of the biggest things I thought was not part of the calculus in when the United States

1:14:16.460 --> 1:14:27.520
 invaded Afghanistan and Iraq is the creation of hate. When you drop a bomb, even if it

1:14:27.520 --> 1:14:34.960
 hits military targets, even if it kills soldiers, which in that case it didn't, there's a very

1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:45.040
 large amount of civilians. What does that do to the, yeah, like, how many years, minutes,

1:14:45.040 --> 1:14:50.320
 hours, months, and years of hate do you create with a single bomb you drop? And I calculate

1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:57.200
 that like literally in the Pentagon have a chart, how many people will hate us? How many

1:14:57.200 --> 1:15:01.480
 people does it take, do some science here, how many people does it take, when you have

1:15:01.480 --> 1:15:09.240
 a million people that hate you, how many of them will become terrorists? How many of them

1:15:09.240 --> 1:15:15.120
 will do something to the nation you love and care about, which is the United States, will

1:15:15.120 --> 1:15:21.760
 do something that will be very costly? I feel like there was not a plot in a chart. It was

1:15:21.760 --> 1:15:24.200
 more about short term effects.

1:15:24.200 --> 1:15:31.480
 Yes, it's again, it's the idea of using military force to solve political problems. And I think

1:15:31.480 --> 1:15:37.200
 there's a squandering of goodwill that people have around the world toward the United States.

1:15:37.200 --> 1:15:43.040
 That's a respect for its economy, for its consumer products, and so forth. And I think

1:15:43.040 --> 1:15:46.240
 that's been lost, a lot of that.

1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:51.440
 Do you think leaders can stop war? I have perhaps a romantic notion, perhaps because

1:15:51.440 --> 1:15:55.760
 I do these podcasts in person and so on, that leaders that get in a room together and can

1:15:55.760 --> 1:16:04.160
 talk, they can stop war. I mean, that's the power of a leader, especially one in an authoritarian

1:16:04.160 --> 1:16:14.460
 regime that they can, through camaraderie, alleviate some of the emotions associated

1:16:14.460 --> 1:16:16.120
 with ego.

1:16:16.120 --> 1:16:25.800
 Yes, leaders can stop war if they get into the room when they understand from the masses

1:16:25.800 --> 1:16:31.920
 in their countries that war is something that they want stopped.

1:16:31.920 --> 1:16:34.600
 So the people ultimately have a really big say.

1:16:34.600 --> 1:16:42.220
 They do, that it was mass movements by people in the United States for the nuclear freeze,

1:16:42.220 --> 1:16:48.760
 even Russia pushing for openness that brought, for example, Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev

1:16:48.760 --> 1:16:56.800
 to Reykjavik to sort of debate and eventually sort of put caps on nuclear weapons. Those

1:16:56.800 --> 1:17:04.760
 two people made choices in the room that made that possible, but they were both being pushed

1:17:04.760 --> 1:17:07.800
 and knew they were being pushed by their people.

1:17:07.800 --> 1:17:15.240
 Boy, that's a tough one. It puts a lot of responsibility on the German people, for example.

1:17:15.240 --> 1:17:23.120
 In both wars, we fans of history tend to conceive of history as a meeting of leaders. We think

1:17:23.120 --> 1:17:27.240
 of Chamberlain, we think of Churchill and the importance of them in the Second World

1:17:27.240 --> 1:17:32.880
 War. We think about Hitler and Stalin and think that if certain conversations happen,

1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:39.120
 the war could have been avoided. You tell the story of how many times Hitler and Nazi

1:17:39.120 --> 1:17:46.280
 Germany's military might was not sufficient, they could have been easily stopped. And the

1:17:46.280 --> 1:17:53.720
 pacifists, the people who believed Hitler or foolish enough to believe Hitler didn't

1:17:53.720 --> 1:18:01.680
 act properly. And if the leaders just woke up to that idea, in fact, Churchill is a kind

1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:06.180
 of representation of that. But in your conception here, it's possible that Churchill was also

1:18:06.180 --> 1:18:16.240
 a representation of the British people, even though seemingly unpopular. That gave birth

1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:21.360
 to somebody like Churchill, who said, we'll never surrender, right? She'll fight in the

1:18:21.360 --> 1:18:22.360
 beaches.

1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:30.140
 Yeah. And I think World War II Britain is a good example of that. It is clearly a dynamic

1:18:30.140 --> 1:18:38.120
 leader who has his pulse on what the people want and demand and are willing to do. And

1:18:38.120 --> 1:18:44.400
 you know, it's a dynamic art of leading that and shaping those wants at the same time as

1:18:44.400 --> 1:18:47.080
 knowing that you're bound by them.

1:18:47.080 --> 1:18:53.300
 Well then if we conceive of history in this way, let me ask you about our presidents.

1:18:53.300 --> 1:19:00.680
 You are taking on the impossibly difficult task of teaching a course in a couple of years

1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:08.080
 here or in one year called the history of American presidential elections. So if the

1:19:08.080 --> 1:19:17.040
 people are in part responsible for leaders, how can we explain what is going on in America

1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:22.920
 that we have the leaders that we do today? So if we think about the elections of the

1:19:22.920 --> 1:19:31.280
 past several cycles, I guess let me ask, are we a divided nation? Are we more of a divided

1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:36.480
 nation than we were in the past? What do you understand about the American citizen at the

1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:41.760
 beginning of this century from the leaders we have elected?

1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:54.740
 Yes, obviously we are a divided country in our rhetoric, in our day to day politics.

1:19:54.740 --> 1:20:01.800
 But we are nowhere near as divided as we have been in other periods in our history, right?

1:20:01.800 --> 1:20:09.080
 The most obvious, of course, being in the American Civil War, 150 years ago. And the

1:20:09.080 --> 1:20:16.880
 distinction is not just that we haven't come to blows, but that we are fundamentally one

1:20:16.880 --> 1:20:26.680
 society, one economy, and sort of deeply integrated as a nation, both domestically and on the

1:20:26.680 --> 1:20:36.880
 world stage in ways that look nothing like the United States in 1861. Will political

1:20:36.880 --> 1:20:44.240
 rhetoric continue to be extreme? Of course. But we're not as divided as people think we

1:20:44.240 --> 1:20:47.440
 are.

1:20:47.440 --> 1:20:55.240
 Well, then if you actually look throughout human history, does it always get, so outside

1:20:55.240 --> 1:21:02.320
 of the people, do the elections get as contentious as they've recently been? So there's a kind

1:21:02.320 --> 1:21:08.060
 of perception has been very close and there's a lot of accusations, a lot of tensions. It's

1:21:08.060 --> 1:21:14.340
 very heated. It's almost fueling the machine of division. Has that often been the case?

1:21:14.340 --> 1:21:20.440
 It has. It hasn't, it hasn't. I mean, I do think right now is different. And there it's

1:21:20.440 --> 1:21:26.560
 worth distinguishing, are there deep social or economic divisions, which I don't actually

1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:31.600
 think that there are, versus partisanship in particular, sort of the rivalry between

1:21:31.600 --> 1:21:37.480
 the two parties. And it's very clear that we are in an era of what political scientists

1:21:37.480 --> 1:21:43.640
 call hyper partisanship, right? And that the two parties have taken sort of fundamentally

1:21:43.640 --> 1:21:52.800
 different positions and moved further apart from one another. And that is what I think

1:21:52.800 --> 1:21:57.720
 people talk about when they say our country is divided. So the country may not be divided

1:21:57.720 --> 1:22:04.160
 even if our politics are highly partisan. That is a divergence from other time periods

1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:05.160
 in our history.

1:22:05.160 --> 1:22:15.280
 So I wonder if this kind of political partisanship is actually an illusion of division. I sometimes

1:22:15.280 --> 1:22:25.880
 feel like we mostly all agree on some basic fundamentals and the things that people allegedly

1:22:25.880 --> 1:22:31.520
 disagree on are really blown out of proportion. And there's like a media machine and the politicians

1:22:31.520 --> 1:22:38.400
 really want you to pick a blue side and a red side. And because of that, somehow I mean,

1:22:38.400 --> 1:22:42.980
 families break up over Thanksgiving dinner about who they voted for. There's a really

1:22:42.980 --> 1:22:50.880
 strong pressure to be the red or blue. And I wonder if that's a feature or a bug. Whether

1:22:50.880 --> 1:22:55.800
 this is just part of the mechanism of democracy that we want to, even if there's not a real

1:22:55.800 --> 1:23:01.560
 thing to be divided over, we need to construct it such that you can always have attention

1:23:01.560 --> 1:23:08.520
 of ideas in order to make progress, to figure out how to progress as a nation.

1:23:08.520 --> 1:23:13.400
 I think we're figuring that out in real time. On the one hand, it's easy to say that it's

1:23:13.400 --> 1:23:21.640
 a feature of a political system that has two parties. And the United States is in some

1:23:21.640 --> 1:23:28.960
 ways unique in not being a parliamentary democracy. And so in some ways, you would think that

1:23:28.960 --> 1:23:37.240
 would be the feature that is causing partisanship and to reach these heights. That said, we

1:23:37.240 --> 1:23:44.960
 can even see in parliamentary systems all around the world that the same kinds of rhetorics

1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:53.280
 of irreconcilable division, a kind of politics of emotion are proliferating around the world.

1:23:53.280 --> 1:24:01.980
 Some of that, as you say, I think is not as real as it appears on television, on social

1:24:01.980 --> 1:24:08.880
 media and other formats. I don't know that other countries that are experiencing political

1:24:08.880 --> 1:24:12.960
 conflict, I'm not sure that they're deeply divided either.

1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:23.240
 So I've had the fortune of being intellectually active through the George Bush versus Al Gore

1:24:23.240 --> 1:24:29.920
 election, then the Obama and it's just every election since. And it seems like a large

1:24:29.920 --> 1:24:36.400
 percentage of those elections, there's been a claim that the elections were rigged, that

1:24:36.400 --> 1:24:44.920
 there is some conspiracy, corruption, malevolence on the other side. I distinctly remember when

1:24:44.920 --> 1:24:52.040
 Donald Trump won in 2016, a lot of people I know said that election was rigged and there's

1:24:52.040 --> 1:24:59.940
 different explanations, including Russian influence. And then in 2020, I was just running

1:24:59.940 --> 1:25:07.680
 in Austin along the river and somebody said like, oh, huge fan of the podcast. And they

1:25:07.680 --> 1:25:11.520
 said like, what do you think of it? This is just not right. What's happening in this country

1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:21.520
 that the 2020 election was obviously rigged from their perspective in electing Joe Biden

1:25:21.520 --> 1:25:28.320
 versus Donald Trump. Do you think there's a case to be made for and against each claim

1:25:28.320 --> 1:25:34.760
 in the full context of history of our elections being rigged?

1:25:34.760 --> 1:25:49.760
 I think the American election system is fundamentally sound and reliable. And I think that the evidence

1:25:49.760 --> 1:25:57.280
 is clear for that regardless of which election you're looking at. In some ways, whether you

1:25:57.280 --> 1:26:04.420
 look at a presidential election or even a local county election for dog catcher or something,

1:26:04.420 --> 1:26:14.160
 that the amount of time and resources and precision that go into voter registration,

1:26:14.160 --> 1:26:22.880
 vote counting, certification processes are crucial to democratic institutions.

1:26:22.880 --> 1:26:29.900
 I think when someone says rigged, regardless of which side of the political spectrum they're

1:26:29.900 --> 1:26:39.980
 coming from, they're looking for an answer. They're looking for that one answer for what

1:26:39.980 --> 1:26:48.480
 is in fact a complex system. So on the left, when they say rigged, they may be pointing

1:26:48.480 --> 1:27:01.200
 to a wide range of ways in which they think that the system is tilted through gerrymandering,

1:27:01.200 --> 1:27:06.920
 misrepresentation through the electoral college. On the right, when people say rigged, they

1:27:06.920 --> 1:27:17.720
 may be concerned about voter security, about ways in which the mainstream media may control

1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:29.360
 messages. And in both cases, the feeling is it's articulated as my vote didn't get counted

1:27:29.360 --> 1:27:41.520
 right. But the deeper concern is my vote doesn't count. My voice isn't being heard. So no, I

1:27:41.520 --> 1:27:43.400
 don't think the elections are rigged.

1:27:43.400 --> 1:27:50.240
 So let me sort of push back, right? There's a comfort to the story that they're not rigged.

1:27:50.240 --> 1:27:55.760
 And a lot of us like to live in comfort. So people who articulate conspiracy theories

1:27:55.760 --> 1:28:01.400
 say, sure, it's nice to be comfortable, but here's the reality. And the thing they articulate

1:28:01.400 --> 1:28:07.000
 is there's incentives in close elections, which we seem to have nonstop close elections.

1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:13.280
 There's so many financial interests. There's so many powerful people. Surely you can construct

1:28:13.280 --> 1:28:18.520
 not just with the media and all the ways you describe both on the left and the right, the

1:28:18.520 --> 1:28:28.080
 elections could be rigged, but literally actually in a fully illegal way manipulate the results

1:28:28.080 --> 1:28:37.880
 of votes. Surely there's incentive to do that. And I don't think that's a totally ridiculous

1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:46.560
 argument because it's like, all right, well, I mean, it actually lands to the question,

1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:52.960
 which is a hard question for me to ask as an optimist of how many malevolent people

1:28:52.960 --> 1:29:00.040
 out there and how many malevolent people are required to rig an election. So how many,

1:29:00.040 --> 1:29:08.480
 what is the face transition for a system to become from like a corruption light to high

1:29:08.480 --> 1:29:15.640
 level of corruption such that you could do things like rig elections, which is what happens

1:29:15.640 --> 1:29:20.160
 quite a lot in many nations in the world even today.

1:29:20.160 --> 1:29:24.760
 So yes, there is interference in elections and there has been in American history. And

1:29:24.760 --> 1:29:31.640
 we can go all the way back into the 18th century. You don't have to go back to Texas in the

1:29:31.640 --> 1:29:39.880
 1960s, LBJ to find examples of direct interference in the outcome of elections. And there are

1:29:39.880 --> 1:29:48.880
 incentives to do that. Those incentives will only feel more existential as hyper partisanship

1:29:48.880 --> 1:29:56.360
 makes people think that the outcome of the elections are a matter of black and white

1:29:56.360 --> 1:30:07.800
 or life and death. And you will see people organizing every way they can to shape elections.

1:30:07.800 --> 1:30:15.200
 We saw this in the 1850s when settlers, pro and anti slavery, flooded into Kansas to try

1:30:15.200 --> 1:30:22.340
 to determine the outcome of an election. We see this in the reconstruction period, right?

1:30:22.340 --> 1:30:30.920
 When the Ku Klux Klan shows up to block the doors for black voters in the South. This

1:30:30.920 --> 1:30:39.920
 history is not new, it's there. I think the reason why I think that the system is sound

1:30:39.920 --> 1:30:49.040
 is not... When I say I believe that the election system is fundamentally sound, I'm not trying

1:30:49.040 --> 1:30:55.400
 to be reassuring or encourage complacency, right? I'm saying this is something that we

1:30:55.400 --> 1:30:58.280
 need to do and to work on.

1:30:58.280 --> 1:31:05.960
 So the current electoral mechanisms are sufficiently robust. Even if there is corruption, even

1:31:05.960 --> 1:31:13.400
 if there is rigging, the force that self corrects and ensures that nobody gets out of line is

1:31:13.400 --> 1:31:18.800
 much stronger than the other incentives, which are the corrupting incentives. And that's

1:31:18.800 --> 1:31:25.840
 the thing I talked about visiting Ukraine, talking about corruption, where a lot of people

1:31:25.840 --> 1:31:34.800
 talk about corruption as being a symptom. If the system allows, creates these incentives

1:31:34.800 --> 1:31:38.960
 for there to be corruption, humans will always go for corruption. That's just, you have to

1:31:38.960 --> 1:31:44.120
 assume that. The power of the United States is that it constructs systems that prevent

1:31:44.120 --> 1:31:47.880
 you from being corrupt at scale. At least, I mean, it depends what you believe of most

1:31:47.880 --> 1:31:53.800
 of us. If you believe in this country, you have to... You believe in the self correcting

1:31:53.800 --> 1:32:01.680
 mechanisms of corruption, that even if that desire is in the human heart, the system resists

1:32:01.680 --> 1:32:07.200
 it, prevents it. That's your current belief.

1:32:07.200 --> 1:32:20.080
 Yes, as of today. But I do think that that will require oversight by institutions, ideally

1:32:20.080 --> 1:32:24.160
 ones that are insulated as much as possible from partisan politics, which is very difficult

1:32:24.160 --> 1:32:32.200
 right now. And it will require the demands of the American people that they want these

1:32:32.200 --> 1:32:41.620
 elections to be fair and secure. And that means being willing to lose them, regardless

1:32:41.620 --> 1:32:43.680
 of which party you're in favor of.

1:32:43.680 --> 1:32:49.040
 So what do you think about the power of the media to create partisanship? I'm really worried

1:32:49.040 --> 1:32:55.560
 that there's a huge incentive, speaking of incentives, to divide the country. The media

1:32:55.560 --> 1:33:00.400
 and the politicians, I'm not sure where it originates, but it feels like it's the media.

1:33:00.400 --> 1:33:06.000
 Maybe it's a very cynical perspective on journalism, but it seems like if we're angry and divided

1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:11.000
 as evenly as possible, you're going to maximize the number of clicks. So it's almost like

1:33:11.000 --> 1:33:19.080
 the media wants to elect people that are going to be the most divisive, maximizing. And the

1:33:19.080 --> 1:33:27.760
 worry I have is they are not beyond either feeding or, if you want to be very cynical,

1:33:27.760 --> 1:33:34.240
 manufacturing narratives that lead that division, like the narrative of an election being rigged.

1:33:34.240 --> 1:33:39.600
 Because if you convinced half the populace that the election was completely rigged, that's

1:33:39.600 --> 1:33:47.040
 a really good way to get a lot of clicks. And the very cynical view is I don't know

1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:57.240
 if the media machine will stop the destruction of our democracy in service of getting more

1:33:57.240 --> 1:34:04.600
 clicks. It may destroy our entire democracy just to get more clicks, just because the

1:34:04.600 --> 1:34:13.360
 fire as the thing burns down will get clicks. Am I putting too much blame on the media here?

1:34:13.360 --> 1:34:14.440
 The machine of it?

1:34:14.440 --> 1:34:22.260
 You're diagnosing the incentive structure, you're depicting that with 100% accuracy.

1:34:22.260 --> 1:34:28.760
 But I think history teaches that you might be giving the media too much sort of causal

1:34:28.760 --> 1:34:39.160
 power, that the American people are smarter than the media that they consume. Even today,

1:34:39.160 --> 1:34:50.480
 we know that. Even people who consume just Fox or just MSNBC know what they're consuming.

1:34:50.480 --> 1:34:57.800
 So I don't think that media will be the solution. And I certainly don't think that returning

1:34:57.800 --> 1:35:04.800
 to a media structure of the mid 20th century with three news channels that all tell us

1:35:04.800 --> 1:35:11.480
 one story, that's no golden age that we're trying to get back to, for sure.

1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:18.560
 Well, there is a novel thing in human history, which is Twitter and social media and so on.

1:35:18.560 --> 1:35:23.840
 So we're trying to find our footing as a nation to figure out how to think about politics,

1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:34.520
 how to maintain our basic freedoms, our sense of democracy, of our interaction with government

1:35:34.520 --> 1:35:42.720
 and so on, on this new medium of social media. Do you think Twitter, how do you think Twitter

1:35:42.720 --> 1:35:49.400
 changed things? Do you think Twitter is good for democracy? Do you think it has changed

1:35:49.400 --> 1:35:56.120
 what it means to be an American citizen? Or is it just the same old media mechanism?

1:35:56.120 --> 1:36:05.080
 It has not changed what it means to be an American citizen. It may have changed the

1:36:05.080 --> 1:36:14.000
 day to day sound of being and the experience of it. It got noisier, it got louder and it

1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:23.280
 got more decentered. I think Twitter, it's paradoxical. On the one hand, it is a fundamentally

1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:33.260
 democratic platform. And in some ways, it democratizes institutions that had gatekeepers

1:36:33.260 --> 1:36:37.880
 and authority figures for a very long time. But on the other hand, it's not a democratic

1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:45.240
 institution at all. It's a for profit corporation. And it operates under those principles. And

1:36:45.240 --> 1:36:54.000
 so that said, it's an institution of American and global life that the people of the United

1:36:54.000 --> 1:37:02.200
 States have the authority to regulate or reshape as they see fit, both that and other major

1:37:02.200 --> 1:37:03.200
 media players.

1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:08.280
 So one of the most dramatic decisions that illustrate both sides of what you're saying

1:37:08.280 --> 1:37:14.320
 is when Twitter decided to ban, I think permanently, the President of the United States, Donald

1:37:14.320 --> 1:37:21.480
 Trump off of Twitter. Can you make the case that that was a good idea and make the case

1:37:21.480 --> 1:37:25.360
 that that was a bad idea? Can you see both perspectives on this?

1:37:25.360 --> 1:37:31.880
 Yes, I think, I mean, the simple fact of the matter is, you know, Twitter is a platform,

1:37:31.880 --> 1:37:38.120
 it has rules of service. Twitter concluded that President Trump had violated the terms

1:37:38.120 --> 1:37:44.800
 of service and blocked him, right? And if you have rules, you have to enforce them.

1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:54.160
 Did it have, you know, did it have consequences? It had direct and predictable consequences,

1:37:54.160 --> 1:38:04.440
 you know, that of creating a sense among millions of Americans that Twitter had taken a side

1:38:04.440 --> 1:38:12.160
 in politics or confirming their belief that it had done so. Will it have unintended consequences?

1:38:12.160 --> 1:38:17.000
 You know, this is where the historian can come in and say, yes, there's always unintended

1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:24.240
 consequences. And we don't know, you know, sort of what it would mean for political figures

1:38:24.240 --> 1:38:34.680
 to be excluded from various media platforms under sort of under these notions, right,

1:38:34.680 --> 1:38:41.320
 that they had violated terms of service, etc. So, you know, so I guess we'll see, I guess.

1:38:41.320 --> 1:38:48.480
 Well, to me, so I'm generally against censorship. But to take Twitter's perspective, it's unclear

1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:56.760
 to me, in terms of unintended consequences, whether censoring a human being from being

1:38:56.760 --> 1:39:05.320
 part of your platform is going to decrease or increase the amount of hate in the world.

1:39:05.320 --> 1:39:11.160
 So there's a strong case to be made that banning somebody like Donald Trump increases the amount

1:39:11.160 --> 1:39:18.640
 of resentment among people, and that's a very large number of people that support him, or

1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:23.120
 even love him, or even see him as a great president, one of the greatest this country

1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:30.740
 has had. And so if you completely suppress his voice, you're going to intensify the support

1:39:30.740 --> 1:39:36.920
 that he has, from just the regular support for another human being who ran for president,

1:39:36.920 --> 1:39:43.800
 to somebody that becomes an almost heroic figure for that set of people. Now, the flipside

1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:52.000
 is removing a person from a platform like Donald Trump might lessen the megaphone of

1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:59.920
 that particular person, might actually level the democratic notion that everybody has a

1:39:59.920 --> 1:40:08.600
 voice. So basically, removing the loud extremes is helpful for giving the center, the calm,

1:40:08.600 --> 1:40:14.120
 the thoughtful voices more power. And so in that sense, that teaches a lesson that don't

1:40:14.120 --> 1:40:23.080
 be crazy in any one direction. Don't go full, don't go Lenin, don't go Hitler, don't, don't,

1:40:23.080 --> 1:40:27.560
 like you have to stay in the middle. There's divisions in the middle, there's discussions

1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:34.440
 in the middle, but stay in the middle. That's sort of the steel man the case for, for censoring.

1:40:34.440 --> 1:40:44.280
 But I, boy, is censorship a slippery slope. And also boys Twitter becoming a thing that's

1:40:44.280 --> 1:40:51.800
 more than just a company. It seems like it's a medium of communication that we use for,

1:40:51.800 --> 1:40:59.400
 for information, for, for knowledge, for wisdom even, you know, during the period of COVID,

1:40:59.400 --> 1:41:03.760
 we use that to gain an understanding of what the hell's going on. What should we do? What's

1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:08.600
 the state of the art science? Science fundamentally transformed during the time of COVID because

1:41:08.600 --> 1:41:13.080
 you have no time for the full review cycle that science usually goes through. And some

1:41:13.080 --> 1:41:19.800
 of the best sources of information for me, from the conspiracy theory to the best doctors

1:41:19.800 --> 1:41:25.200
 was Twitter. The data, the stats, all that kind of stuff. And that feels like, like more

1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:30.120
 than a com more than a company. And then Twitter and YouTube and different places took a really

1:41:30.120 --> 1:41:36.320
 strong stance on COVID, which is the lazy stance in my opinion, which is we're going

1:41:36.320 --> 1:41:43.800
 to listen to whatever CDC or the institutions have said. But the reality is you're an institution

1:41:43.800 --> 1:41:51.880
 of your own now. You're kind of the press. You're like, there's a, there's a, it's, it's

1:41:51.880 --> 1:41:57.320
 a really difficult position. It's a really, really difficult position to take. But I wish

1:41:57.320 --> 1:42:02.840
 they've stepped up and take on the full responsibility and the pain of fighting for the freedom of

1:42:02.840 --> 1:42:14.320
 speech. Yes, they need, they need to do that. But you know, I'm struck by some of the things

1:42:14.320 --> 1:42:22.760
 that you said, ways in which, you know, Twitter has the power to shape the conversation. And

1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:30.960
 I don't think in a democratic society, democratic policies should cede that power to, to for

1:42:30.960 --> 1:42:38.080
 profit companies. Do you agree that it's possible that Twitter has that power currently? Do

1:42:38.080 --> 1:42:43.000
 you sense that it has the power? Is that my sense is Twitter has the power to start wars,

1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:50.360
 like tweets have the power to start wars to, to, yeah, to, to change the direction of elections?

1:42:50.360 --> 1:42:56.000
 Maybe in the sense in the ways in which, you know, a wave has the power to wash away sand,

1:42:56.000 --> 1:43:02.120
 right? You know, it's, it's the, it's still the medium, right? It's not, it's not in itself

1:43:02.120 --> 1:43:07.680
 an actor. It's how actors use the platform, which requires us to scrutinize the structure

1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:11.800
 of the platform and access to it. Unfortunately, it's not, maybe it's similar to the wave.

1:43:11.800 --> 1:43:20.800
 It's not just a medium. It's a, it's a medium plus, it's a medium that enables virality

1:43:20.800 --> 1:43:29.920
 that benefits from virality of engagement. And that means singular voices can, can have

1:43:29.920 --> 1:43:36.640
 a disproportionate impact, like not even voices, singular ideas, dramatic ideas can have a

1:43:36.640 --> 1:43:42.680
 disproportionate impact. And so that actually threatens, it's almost like I don't know what

1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:48.180
 the equivalent is in nature, but it's a, it's a wave that can grow exponentially because

1:43:48.180 --> 1:43:54.840
 of the intensity of the, the initial intensity of the wave. I don't know how to describe

1:43:54.840 --> 1:44:01.360
 this as a dynamical system, but it feels like, it feels like there, there is a responsibility

1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:05.880
 there not to accelerate, not to accelerate voices just because they get a lot of engagement.

1:44:05.880 --> 1:44:13.080
 You have to have a proportional representation of that voice. But you're saying that a strong

1:44:13.080 --> 1:44:20.000
 democracy should be robust to that. A strong democracy can and should, and will be. I mean,

1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:24.840
 I think the other thing a historian will tell you about Twitter is that this too shall pass,

1:44:24.840 --> 1:44:30.700
 right? Yeah. But, but I do think, you know, the structures of, of the, of the platform

1:44:30.700 --> 1:44:39.400
 of the algorithm of, of this and other major players are, are eligible for scrutiny by,

1:44:39.400 --> 1:44:45.800
 by democratic institutions. So in preparing to teach the course, the history of American

1:44:45.800 --> 1:44:52.400
 presidential elections leading up to the 2024 elections. So one of the lessons of history

1:44:52.400 --> 1:44:57.840
 is this too shall pass. So don't make everything about, this is, this is going to either save

1:44:57.840 --> 1:45:03.280
 or destroy our nation. That seems to be like the message of every single election. As I'm

1:45:03.280 --> 1:45:08.720
 doing Trump hands. Do you think Donald Trump, what do you think about the 2024 election?

1:45:08.720 --> 1:45:18.240
 Do you think Donald Trump runs? Do you think the, the tension will grow? Or was that a

1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:25.040
 singular moment? Do you think you'll be like AOC versus Trump or whoever, whatever the

1:45:25.040 --> 1:45:30.960
 most maximum drama maximizing thing? Or will things stabilize?

1:45:30.960 --> 1:45:34.760
 I think I can, I can, you know, historians don't like to predict the future, but I can

1:45:34.760 --> 1:45:40.560
 predict this one that it will not be a calm and, and, and stabilized election. I think

1:45:40.560 --> 1:45:45.320
 as of, you know, the time that we're talking in 2022, we don't, there are too many you

1:45:45.320 --> 1:45:50.160
 know, sort of open questions, particularly about whether Joe Biden will run for reelection.

1:45:50.160 --> 1:45:58.000
 He says he will, but you know, but the jury I think is out on that. You know, I, I can't

1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:05.320
 predict whether Donald Trump will run for, for election or not. I think you know, we

1:46:05.320 --> 1:46:13.680
 do know that, that, that president Trump doesn't like to, to start things he can't win. And

1:46:13.680 --> 1:46:19.180
 if the polling data suggests that he's not a credible candidate, he might be reluctant

1:46:19.180 --> 1:46:26.700
 to enter the race and might might find more appealing, the kind of sideline kind of King

1:46:26.700 --> 1:46:32.740
 maker role that he's been crafting since he left the White House. You know, I think there

1:46:32.740 --> 1:46:38.520
 are plenty of people who are you know, dreaming that there's some sort of centrist candidate

1:46:38.520 --> 1:46:45.080
 you know, you know whether it's a conservative Democrat or a liberal Republican who will

1:46:45.080 --> 1:46:50.860
 you know, save us from, from, from all of this either within the party or in a third

1:46:50.860 --> 1:46:53.300
 party run. I don't think that's likely.

1:46:53.300 --> 1:46:56.840
 Why aren't we getting them? Why don't you think it's likely? What's the explanation?

1:46:56.840 --> 1:46:59.500
 This seems to be a general hunger for a person like this.

1:46:59.500 --> 1:47:03.960
 You would, but the system sorts it out, right? You know, that the, the, that the primary systems

1:47:03.960 --> 1:47:09.920
 and the party you know, party candidate selection systems you know, will favor sort of more,

1:47:09.920 --> 1:47:15.400
 you know, more partisan views, right? More conservative Republicans, more liberal Democrats

1:47:15.400 --> 1:47:18.080
 as the kind of center candidates.

1:47:18.080 --> 1:47:26.800
 It seems like the system prefers mediocre executor, mediocre leaders, mediocre partisan

1:47:26.800 --> 1:47:31.600
 leaders. If I had to take a cynical look, but maybe I'm romanticizing the leaders of

1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:37.160
 the past and maybe I'm just remembering the great leaders of the past. And yeah, I can

1:47:37.160 --> 1:47:41.760
 assure you there's plenty of mediocre partisans in the 19th century.

1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:52.960
 In the 20th. Well, let me ask you about platforming. Do you think Donald, it's the Twitter question,

1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:58.680
 but I was torn about whether to talk to Donald Trump on this podcast. As a historian, what

1:47:58.680 --> 1:48:01.400
 would you advise?

1:48:01.400 --> 1:48:08.420
 I think, I mean, you know, this is a, this is a difficult question, right? For, for historians

1:48:08.420 --> 1:48:15.320
 who want, you know, sort of want to make sure that they know sort of what Americans are

1:48:15.320 --> 1:48:21.160
 thinking and talking about, you know, for centuries later. So one of the things that,

1:48:21.160 --> 1:48:27.320
 you know, at least my understanding is that when President Trump was banned from Twitter,

1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:33.920
 his account was also deleted. And that is one of the most valuable sources that historians

1:48:33.920 --> 1:48:40.600
 will use to understand that the era and parts of it were sort of, you know, archived and

1:48:40.600 --> 1:48:45.560
 reconstructed. But, you know, but in that sense, I think that that is also a real loss

1:48:45.560 --> 1:48:51.800
 to the historical record. I mean, I think that your podcast shows you'll, you'll talk

1:48:51.800 --> 1:48:59.240
 to, you'll talk to anyone. I'm here, right? So, you know, I'm not in the business of saying,

1:48:59.240 --> 1:49:01.560
 you know, don't, don't, don't talk, don't talk.

1:49:01.560 --> 1:49:06.320
 That's one of the difficult things when I think about Hitler. I think Hitler, Stalin,

1:49:06.320 --> 1:49:16.200
 I don't know if World War I quite has the same intensity of controversial leaders. But

1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:21.200
 one of the sad things from a historian perspective is how few interviews Hitler has given or

1:49:21.200 --> 1:49:28.120
 Stalin has given. And that's such a difficult thing because it's obvious that talking to

1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:35.880
 Donald Trump, that talking to Xi Jinping, talking to Putin is really valuable from a

1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:42.080
 historical perspective to understand. But then you think about the momentary impact

1:49:42.080 --> 1:49:46.720
 of such a conversation and you think, well, depending on how the conversation goes, you

1:49:46.720 --> 1:49:59.080
 could steer or a flame. What is it? Feed the flame of war or conflict or, um, abuses of

1:49:59.080 --> 1:50:04.280
 power and things like this. And that's, I think the tension between the journalist and

1:50:04.280 --> 1:50:11.440
 the historian, because when a journalist interview dictators, for example, one of the things

1:50:11.440 --> 1:50:20.080
 that strikes me is they're often very critical of the dictator. They're, they're, they're

1:50:20.080 --> 1:50:26.000
 like, um, they're basically attacking them in front of their face as opposed to trying

1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:32.400
 to understand. Because what I perceive they're doing is they're signaling to the other journalists

1:50:32.400 --> 1:50:37.360
 that they're on the right side of history kind of thing. Um, but that's not very productive.

1:50:37.360 --> 1:50:42.040
 That's also why the dictators and leaders often don't do those interviews. It's not

1:50:42.040 --> 1:50:47.720
 productive to understanding who the human being is. To understand, you have to empathize.

1:50:47.720 --> 1:50:54.560
 Because few people, I think few leaders do something from a place of malevolence. I think

1:50:54.560 --> 1:50:59.960
 they really do think they're doing good. And not even for themselves, not even for selfish

1:50:59.960 --> 1:51:06.600
 reasons. I think they're doing great for the, they're doing the right thing for their country

1:51:06.600 --> 1:51:10.960
 or for whoever the group they're leading. And to understand that you have to, and, and

1:51:10.960 --> 1:51:17.880
 by the way, a large percent of the country often supports them. I bet if you poll legitimately

1:51:17.880 --> 1:51:23.040
 poll people in North Korea, they will believe that their leader is doing the right thing

1:51:23.040 --> 1:51:29.680
 for their country. Um, and so to understand that you have to empathize. So that's the

1:51:29.680 --> 1:51:34.360
 tension of the journalist, I think, and the historian, cause obviously the historian doesn't,

1:51:34.360 --> 1:51:39.280
 doesn't care. They really want to, they care obviously deeply, but they, they know that

1:51:39.280 --> 1:51:45.760
 history requires deep understanding of the human being in the full context. Uh, yeah,

1:51:45.760 --> 1:51:47.120
 it's a tough decision to make.

1:51:47.120 --> 1:51:52.960
 Yeah. Well, I think it's, uh, both for journalists and historians, um, the challenge is not to

1:51:52.960 --> 1:51:59.880
 be too close to your subject, right? Um, and you know, not to be, um, overly influenced

1:51:59.880 --> 1:52:05.000
 and used by them, right? You know, when you're talking to a living subject, which historians

1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:11.600
 do, you know, um, to, um, you know, it's, it's a matter of making sure that you triangulate

1:52:11.600 --> 1:52:17.920
 their story with, with the rest of the record, right? Um, uh, and that may paint a different

1:52:17.920 --> 1:52:23.880
 picture of, of the person then, um, and will prevent you as a journalist or a historian

1:52:23.880 --> 1:52:30.000
 from kind of, you know, just telling someone else's story. And so, and historians also

1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:34.800
 have the benefit of going back, you know, 30, 40 years and finding all the other stories

1:52:34.800 --> 1:52:40.940
 and figuring out, you know, uh, playing two truths and a lie, you know, which parts are,

1:52:40.940 --> 1:52:44.300
 you know, which parts are accurate, which are, which are not. And journalists do that

1:52:44.300 --> 1:52:48.760
 work in a day to day basis, but historians, um, you know, we get a little more time to

1:52:48.760 --> 1:52:50.240
 think about what we're doing.

1:52:50.240 --> 1:52:57.760
 Well, I, I personally also think it's deeply disrespectful to the populace, to people,

1:52:57.760 --> 1:53:06.060
 to um, censor and ignore a person that's supported by a very large number of people. Like that

1:53:06.060 --> 1:53:16.360
 you owe, I personally feel like you owe the citizens of this country a deep, uh, empathy

1:53:16.360 --> 1:53:22.080
 and understanding of the leaders they support, even if you disagree with what they say. I

1:53:22.080 --> 1:53:28.400
 mean, that's the, the, to me, I'm much more worried about the resentment of the censorship,

1:53:28.400 --> 1:53:34.880
 um, that it's to having a good conversation with Donald Trump is, is ultimately valuable.

1:53:34.880 --> 1:53:41.280
 Uh, because he, I think, uh, especially in this case, I agree with you that Donald Trump

1:53:41.280 --> 1:53:47.600
 is not a singular person. He is a, he represents a set of feelings that a large number of people

1:53:47.600 --> 1:53:52.560
 have and whatever those feelings are, you can try to figure out by talking to people,

1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:57.640
 but also talking to the, the, the, the man and then seeing the interplay there, what

1:53:57.640 --> 1:54:04.240
 does this really represent in this period in history, in this slice of the world? Um,

1:54:04.240 --> 1:54:11.000
 yeah, ultimately understanding, I think leads to, uh, compassion and love and unity, which

1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:16.320
 is how this whole thing progresses. The tension between the different sides is useful to,

1:54:16.320 --> 1:54:21.520
 um, have a good conversation, but ultimately coming up with the right answer and progressing

1:54:21.520 --> 1:54:28.800
 towards that answer is, is how you make progress. Do you think a pure democracy can work? So

1:54:28.800 --> 1:54:34.840
 we have this representative of democracy with these contentious elections and so on. When

1:54:34.840 --> 1:54:41.280
 we start a civilization on Mars, which becomes more and more realistic technologically, we

1:54:41.280 --> 1:54:47.200
 can have a more direct access to be able to vote on issues and vote for ideas. Do you

1:54:47.200 --> 1:54:53.200
 think it can work? I don't think we have to go to Mars, uh, to do it. Right. Um, uh, I

1:54:53.200 --> 1:55:00.160
 think, um, the answer is not, you know, to flip a switch and turn on something called

1:55:00.160 --> 1:55:06.640
 pure democracy. Um, uh, when people are not ready for it, when their, uh, incentive structures

1:55:06.640 --> 1:55:12.880
 are not sort of structured for it, but you can, um, you know, experiment with more democratic

1:55:12.880 --> 1:55:18.600
 forms of governance one after another, right? Whether it's, um, you know, sort of experimenting

1:55:18.600 --> 1:55:25.440
 with, um, technology to find new ways of sort of, of getting, uh, greater rates of participation

1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:32.600
 in democracy. Um, I think that we see some experiments in, um, sort of more complicated

1:55:32.600 --> 1:55:38.980
 systems of voting, um, that in fact might actually be more reflective of people's choices

1:55:38.980 --> 1:55:43.720
 than simply picking one candidate, right? Sort of ranked choice voting or, uh, runoffs,

1:55:43.720 --> 1:55:49.460
 other kinds of things. Um, you know, I think that we can think more, uh, creatively about

1:55:49.460 --> 1:55:53.620
 something like participatory budgeting, right? In which, um, you know, uh, we put all this

1:55:53.620 --> 1:55:58.480
 money into the government. Um, and then, um, you know, we, we, um, you know, should, as

1:55:58.480 --> 1:56:03.360
 a, as a people, there are more democratic ways of, of sort of, of how we spend it. Um,

1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:06.800
 and I think the most urgent in some level is a more, uh, democratic form of foreign

1:56:06.800 --> 1:56:12.240
 policymaking, right? That foreign policymaking, decision making, um, uh, about the military,

1:56:12.240 --> 1:56:18.400
 about foreign policy, um, is, is very ways insulated from, from popular participation,

1:56:18.400 --> 1:56:24.280
 um, in, in modern American history. Um, and I think, you know, there, uh, technology is

1:56:24.280 --> 1:56:29.640
 not the, the going to solve this. Um, you know, it's a combination of technology and,

1:56:29.640 --> 1:56:35.400
 and human creativity, but I think, um, you know, I think we can start heading that direction.

1:56:35.400 --> 1:56:38.680
 Whether we get there before we get to Mars, I don't, I don't know.

1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:43.400
 What interesting lessons and thoughts, if you look at the fundamentals of the history

1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:52.440
 of American elections, do you hope to reveal when you try to teach the class? And, um,

1:56:52.440 --> 1:57:00.400
 how would those fundamentals be met by the, by the students that received that wisdom?

1:57:00.400 --> 1:57:05.280
 So what do you think about this dance? It's such an interesting idea. And I hope you do

1:57:05.280 --> 1:57:11.520
 go through with this kind of idea is look at the history while the next one is happening.

1:57:11.520 --> 1:57:20.440
 Yes. I think, you know, it's worth remembering, right? That the students who are typical American

1:57:20.440 --> 1:57:27.320
 student who's in college right now, right? Has lived their entire life after, uh, the

1:57:27.320 --> 1:57:34.080
 election of 2000 and Bush V Gore, right? Um, and after nine 11 probably. And yeah, absolutely.

1:57:34.080 --> 1:57:41.560
 Yes. After all of, after all of these things. Right. And, and, um, so on the one hand they

1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:49.040
 take partisanship and contentious elections for granted. Um, they don't, I think share,

1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:55.280
 um, you know, sort of some vision that things were, you know, things used to be different,

1:57:55.280 --> 1:58:00.600
 right? They don't remember a world that had like lots of moderate Democrats and liberal

1:58:00.600 --> 1:58:07.200
 Republicans and, um, you know, sort of running around in it. Um, but, um, you know, so in

1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:12.880
 some ways it's a way of, of looking back into the past to find other ways of, of, of organizing

1:58:12.880 --> 1:58:20.400
 our politics. Uh, it's also a way of, of reassuring students that we have been through contentious

1:58:20.400 --> 1:58:26.640
 and even, um, sort of violent elections before in our history. Um, and you know, that people

1:58:26.640 --> 1:58:31.960
 have defended the right to vote, right? People have risked their lives to vote. Um, uh, you

1:58:31.960 --> 1:58:36.760
 know, I think they will, they will understand that, that as well.

1:58:36.760 --> 1:58:44.040
 And maybe knowledge of history here can help deescalate the emotions you might feel about

1:58:44.040 --> 1:58:51.280
 one candidate or another. And I, from a place of calmness, you can more easily arrive at

1:58:51.280 --> 1:58:52.280
 wisdom.

1:58:52.280 --> 1:58:57.200
 Uh, that, that's my hope. Um, yeah.

1:58:57.200 --> 1:59:02.960
 Just as a brief aside, you, brief aside, but nevertheless, uh, you wrote the book Bound

1:59:02.960 --> 1:59:13.240
 by War that describes a century of war in the Pacific. So looking at this slice of geography

1:59:13.240 --> 1:59:18.320
 and power, uh, so most crucially through the partnership between the United States and

1:59:18.320 --> 1:59:24.800
 the Philippines, can you tell us some aspect of the story that is often perhaps not considered

1:59:24.800 --> 1:59:31.520
 when you start to look more at the geopolitics of Europe and Soviet Union and the United

1:59:31.520 --> 1:59:37.920
 States? What, how did the, the war in, in the Pacific define the 20th century?

1:59:37.920 --> 1:59:44.320
 Yeah, I came to this book Bound by War, um, from a sense that, um, that our stories were

1:59:44.320 --> 1:59:50.480
 too lopsided, um, toward, toward Europe, right? That American history, when viewed from the

1:59:50.480 --> 1:59:57.960
 Pacific, um, specifically in the 20th century, um, helps us understand American power, um,

1:59:57.960 --> 2:00:04.440
 in some new ways, right? Uh, not only American, uh, projection of power into Asia, right?

2:00:04.440 --> 2:00:10.760
 But also the ways in which American power affected, uh, people in Asia, right? Um, either

2:00:10.760 --> 2:00:15.640
 as, uh, you know, in places like the Philippines where the United States, uh, had a colony

2:00:15.640 --> 2:00:20.800
 for almost 50 years or Asian Americans, people who had migrated over their descendants in

2:00:20.800 --> 2:00:26.000
 the United States. And those linkages, uh, between the United States and Asia, uh, particularly,

2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:30.800
 uh, the U S Philippine connection, I think were something that needed to be traced across

2:00:30.800 --> 2:00:35.680
 the 20th century. Cause it's a way kind of a new way of seeing American power, you know,

2:00:35.680 --> 2:00:39.480
 from, from a different angle, uh, you see it in, in that way.

2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:44.440
 There's some aspect that define America from, from when you take the perspective of the

2:00:44.440 --> 2:00:50.800
 Pacific, what, what military conflict and, and the asymmetry of power there, right?

2:00:50.800 --> 2:00:56.760
 So I start in, uh, in 1898, um, you know, with the U S invasion of the Philippines,

2:00:56.760 --> 2:01:02.720
 um, uh, it's a conquest and annexation. Uh, and I think in many ways, this is a defining

2:01:02.720 --> 2:01:07.920
 conflict of the 20th century. That's often completely overlooked or described, uh, I

2:01:07.920 --> 2:01:12.840
 think incorrectly as merely a war with Spain, right? That the war in the Philippines, um,

2:01:12.840 --> 2:01:18.720
 is our, uh, our first extended overseas conflict, our first conflict, um, in what would come

2:01:18.720 --> 2:01:23.600
 to be called the developing world or third world. Uh, it's a form of, of counter insurgency.

2:01:23.600 --> 2:01:29.080
 Um, you know, this is the U S army sort of learning lessons that are then repeated again

2:01:29.080 --> 2:01:33.600
 in the second world war in Korea, Vietnam, and, and even after 9 11.

2:01:33.600 --> 2:01:36.320
 Is the Philippines our friends or enemies in this history?

2:01:36.320 --> 2:01:40.580
 Well, that's the interesting part, right? Is that, uh, the book focuses in particular

2:01:40.580 --> 2:01:45.840
 on Filipinos, uh, who fight with the Americans who fought, you know, sort of in the U S army

2:01:45.840 --> 2:01:50.560
 and Navy, um, over the course of the 20th century. And they are in a fundamentally ironic

2:01:50.560 --> 2:01:54.640
 position, right? They are, they are from the Philippines and they're fighting for the United

2:01:54.640 --> 2:02:00.940
 States, um, which is the colonial power, uh, occupying their country. Um, and I think that,

2:02:00.940 --> 2:02:06.120
 that irony persists, right? Um, so if you look at sort of polling data where they ask

2:02:06.120 --> 2:02:09.960
 people all around the world, you know, you know, do you think positively or negatively

2:02:09.960 --> 2:02:16.880
 about the United States? Um, that the highest, uh, responses are from the Philippines, right?

2:02:16.880 --> 2:02:21.000
 Filipinos view the United States more favorably than people from any other country in the

2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:26.320
 world, including America, right? That, that they're more think more favorably of Americans

2:02:26.320 --> 2:02:30.680
 than Americans do. Um, and so, you know, sort of unpacking that irony is, is part of what

2:02:30.680 --> 2:02:32.520
 I'm trying to get at in the book.

2:02:32.520 --> 2:02:37.160
 What was the people power revolution and what lessons can we learn from it? You kind of

2:02:37.160 --> 2:02:45.520
 assign an important, um, a large value to it in terms of what we can learn for the,

2:02:45.520 --> 2:02:47.400
 uh, the American project.

2:02:47.400 --> 2:02:53.480
 Yeah. So in 1986, um, the, the president of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos is overthrown

2:02:53.480 --> 2:02:59.800
 by a popular revolution known as people power, um, uh, in the wake of a contested and probably,

2:02:59.800 --> 2:03:05.120
 uh, almost certainly rigged election, um, that, that sort of, uh, you know, kind of

2:03:05.120 --> 2:03:11.640
 confirms his, his, his rule. Um, when that is over, overturned through sort of mass movements

2:03:11.640 --> 2:03:17.960
 in the Philippines, it's also, uh, sort of confirmed in many ways by the, the reluctance

2:03:17.960 --> 2:03:23.680
 of the United States to intervene, to prop up a cold war ally. Ferdinand Marcos had supported

2:03:23.680 --> 2:03:28.440
 American policy throughout, um, his administration. Um, the Reagan administration, Ronald Reagan's

2:03:28.440 --> 2:03:33.520
 president at the time, basically chooses not to support him. That's a personally wrenching

2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:39.840
 decision for, for Reagan himself. Um, but it, it he's being shaped in many ways by the

2:03:39.840 --> 2:03:46.080
 emerging voices of neoconservative political, uh, foreign policy voices. Um, in particular,

2:03:46.080 --> 2:03:51.560
 uh, Paul Wolfowitz and the state department and others who see sort of movements for democracy

2:03:51.560 --> 2:03:57.000
 and democratization that then kind of, uh, take fire in the late 20th century in Latin

2:03:57.000 --> 2:04:03.440
 America, um, in South Korea, in Eastern Europe, um, and, you know, all around the world until

2:04:03.440 --> 2:04:07.640
 it hits the wall in, in Tiananmen Square in June, 1989.

2:04:07.640 --> 2:04:13.000
 Well, what's that wall? Uh, what's, what's the wall, what's the, what, what do you mean

2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:16.600
 by it hits the wall? So there are, you know, the, there are global

2:04:16.600 --> 2:04:22.400
 movements for pot for democratization, um, for, for, uh, opening up, um, you know, throughout

2:04:22.400 --> 2:04:27.320
 the world, um, starting in the 1980s. Um, and, you know, obviously they continue, um,

2:04:27.320 --> 2:04:31.680
 in Eastern Europe with the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989. Um, you know, I say it hits

2:04:31.680 --> 2:04:38.440
 the wall in, in, in China, um, in, with the protests in Tiananmen Square and that are,

2:04:38.440 --> 2:04:43.840
 that are blocked, um, and that are crushed. And I think represent, uh, a real sort of

2:04:43.840 --> 2:04:49.040
 turning point, um, in the history of, of democratic institutions, uh, on a global scale in the

2:04:49.040 --> 2:04:50.760
 late 20th century.

2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:57.120
 So there's some places where the fight for freedom will work and some places not. And

2:04:57.120 --> 2:05:04.840
 that's the kind of lesson from the 20th to take forward to the 21st century.

2:05:04.840 --> 2:05:09.960
 Uh, no, I think the lesson is, is maybe one that, that, you know, we talked about earlier

2:05:09.960 --> 2:05:15.520
 that there's this dynamic dance between, um, between leaders, whether, uh, totalitarian

2:05:15.520 --> 2:05:21.000
 leaders or leaders of democratic movements and the people that they're leading. Um, and

2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:24.200
 some, you know, sometimes it works and sometimes, sometimes it doesn't.

2:05:24.200 --> 2:05:29.160
 Let me ask a big, ridiculous question because we talked about, uh, sort of presidential

2:05:29.160 --> 2:05:34.240
 elections. Um, now this is objectively, definitively, you have to answer one person. Who is the

2:05:34.240 --> 2:05:36.200
 greatest president in American history?

2:05:36.200 --> 2:05:38.000
 Oh, that's easy.

2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:39.000
 Yeah.

2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:41.360
 Abraham Lincoln.

2:05:41.360 --> 2:05:43.320
 Is that easy? Not George Washington?

2:05:43.320 --> 2:05:49.520
 Um, you know, Washington had his, uh, had the statesman qualities. He understood his

2:05:49.520 --> 2:05:53.400
 power as, as, uh, as the first president.

2:05:53.400 --> 2:05:54.760
 Also relinquished power.

2:05:54.760 --> 2:06:02.560
 He was willing to relinquish power. Um, he, you know, uh, but, but Lincoln has the combination

2:06:02.560 --> 2:06:10.840
 of personal leadership, um, a fundamental moral character and, um, and just the ability

2:06:10.840 --> 2:06:15.960
 to kind of, uh, to fight the, the fight of politics, to play the game of it, um, to get

2:06:15.960 --> 2:06:21.160
 where he's going, to play the short game and the long game, um, to kind of, you know, make

2:06:21.160 --> 2:06:27.440
 to, uh, you know, to work with his enemies, to, to block them when he had to. Um, and

2:06:27.440 --> 2:06:31.360
 you know, I mean, he, uh, gets the United States through the civil war. So you gotta

2:06:31.360 --> 2:06:32.680
 give him some credit for that.

2:06:32.680 --> 2:06:34.160
 And he's pretty good at making speeches.

2:06:34.160 --> 2:06:39.680
 Uh, it, you know, obviously it helps that he's, uh, uh, a remarkable speaker, um, and

2:06:39.680 --> 2:06:45.080
 able to convey those kinds of visions. Um, but, um, you know, but he, but he is first

2:06:45.080 --> 2:06:49.120
 and foremost a politician, um, and probably the best one we have.

2:06:49.120 --> 2:06:52.640
 Both at getting elected and at ruling.

2:06:52.640 --> 2:06:57.200
 In some ways better, better at the doing than at the getting elected, right? Um, you know,

2:06:57.200 --> 2:07:03.320
 that he, uh, you know, the election of 1860 is a, it's just a hot mess. Um, you know,

2:07:03.320 --> 2:07:08.200
 that that could have worked out, um, many different ways. And even the election of 1864,

2:07:08.200 --> 2:07:13.600
 um, you know, when we have a presidential election in the middle of a civil war, um,

2:07:13.600 --> 2:07:17.520
 it was not a foregone conclusion that Lincoln would be reelected. Um, so, you know, both

2:07:17.520 --> 2:07:24.360
 times he's sort of, um, you know, he's not a, a master campaigner, um, by, by any means,

2:07:24.360 --> 2:07:29.240
 but he, he was a master politician as a, as a governor.

2:07:29.240 --> 2:07:35.560
 Do we have leaders like that today? Is, is that, so one perspective is like, well, leaders

2:07:35.560 --> 2:07:40.880
 aren't, ain't what they used to be. And then another perspective is, well, we always romanticize

2:07:40.880 --> 2:07:46.120
 stuff that happens in the past. We forget the flaws and remember the great moments.

2:07:46.120 --> 2:07:52.480
 Yeah. Uh, both of those things are true, right? Um, on the one hand, um, you know, we, we

2:07:52.480 --> 2:07:58.240
 don't, uh, we are not surrounded by people of, of Lincoln's caliber, um, right now.

2:07:58.240 --> 2:07:59.560
 That feels like the case.

2:07:59.560 --> 2:08:05.960
 Um, and I think that, I think we can say that with some certainty, but, um, you know, I,

2:08:05.960 --> 2:08:12.920
 I always like to point to president Harry Truman who left office with, you know, some

2:08:12.920 --> 2:08:19.360
 truly abysmal, uh, uh, presidential ratings, um, was dismissed as a, throughout his presidency

2:08:19.360 --> 2:08:25.400
 as a, you know, as a, as unqualified as not knowing what he was doing, et cetera. And

2:08:25.400 --> 2:08:30.480
 it's then, you know, turns out, um, uh, with hindsight, we know that he was better at the

2:08:30.480 --> 2:08:34.980
 job than anyone understood better at getting elected, right? You remember that sign, do

2:08:34.980 --> 2:08:39.400
 he defeats Truman, right? He showed them, right? Uh, and better, better at holding power

2:08:39.400 --> 2:08:44.480
 and better at sort of, um, you know, kind of building the kind of institutions that

2:08:44.480 --> 2:08:51.200
 long after he was gone, um, demonstrated that he, he, he won the long game.

2:08:51.200 --> 2:08:59.080
 And some of that is the victors do write the story. And, um, I asked myself very much,

2:08:59.080 --> 2:09:05.640
 how will history remember Volodymyr Zelensky? It's not obvious. And how will history remember

2:09:05.640 --> 2:09:17.400
 Putin? That too is not obvious. Um, because it depends on how the role, the geopolitics,

2:09:17.400 --> 2:09:24.560
 the, how the nations, how the history of these nations unravel, unfold rather. So it's very

2:09:24.560 --> 2:09:32.560
 interesting to think about. And the same is true for Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Obama, uh,

2:09:32.560 --> 2:09:41.440
 George Bush, uh, Bill Clinton, and so on. I think it's a probably unanswerable question

2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:46.480
 of which of the presidents will be remembered as a great president from this time. You can

2:09:46.480 --> 2:09:51.800
 make all kinds of cases for all kinds of people and they do, but it's unclear. It's fascinating

2:09:51.800 --> 2:09:56.880
 to think about when the robots finally take over, uh, what, which of the humans they will

2:09:56.880 --> 2:10:05.700
 appreciate the most. Uh, let me ask for advice. Do you have, um, advice for, for young folks

2:10:05.700 --> 2:10:10.280
 as they, uh, uh, cause you mentioned the, the, the folks you're teaching, they don't

2:10:10.280 --> 2:10:15.740
 even, they don't know what it's like to have waited on the internet for the, for the thing

2:10:15.740 --> 2:10:21.200
 to load up for every single webpage is suffering. They don't know what it's like to not have

2:10:21.200 --> 2:10:28.060
 the internet and have a dial phone that goes, and then the joy of getting angry at somebody

2:10:28.060 --> 2:10:32.420
 and hanging up with a physical phone. They don't, they don't know any of that. Uh, so

2:10:32.420 --> 2:10:36.660
 for those young folks that look at the contention election, contentious elections, they look

2:10:36.660 --> 2:10:42.520
 at our contentious world, our divided world. What advice would you give them of how to

2:10:42.520 --> 2:10:46.720
 have a career they can be proud of? Let's say they're in college or in high school and

2:10:46.720 --> 2:10:49.440
 how to have a life they can be proud of.

2:10:49.440 --> 2:10:57.080
 Oh man, that's a big question. Um, yeah, I've never given a graduation speech. Uh,

2:10:57.080 --> 2:11:01.480
 this is like warm up. Let's look for like raw materials before you write it. Uh, if

2:11:01.480 --> 2:11:11.080
 I did, um, I think, um, I think I would advise students, um, that history teaches that you

2:11:11.080 --> 2:11:17.720
 should be more optimistic than, um, than your current surroundings suggest. Right. And I

2:11:17.720 --> 2:11:23.380
 think it would be very easy as a young person today to think, um, there's, there's nothing

2:11:23.380 --> 2:11:28.320
 I can do about this politics. There's nothing I can say to this person on the other side

2:11:28.320 --> 2:11:34.560
 of the aisle. There's nothing I can do about, you know, the planet, um, uh, et cetera, and

2:11:34.560 --> 2:11:42.760
 just sort of give up. Um, and I think history, uh, teaches that, um, you know, uh, you know,

2:11:42.760 --> 2:11:47.240
 we don't know who the winners and losers are in the long run, but, um, but we know that

2:11:47.240 --> 2:11:52.480
 the people who give up are always the losers. Right. Um, so don't give into cynicism or

2:11:52.480 --> 2:11:59.860
 apathy. Yeah. Optimism paves the way. Yeah. Because human beings are deeply, uh, resilient

2:11:59.860 --> 2:12:06.480
 and creative, even under, um, far more difficult circumstances than, um, you know, than we

2:12:06.480 --> 2:12:10.440
 face right now. Well, let me ask a question that you don't even need to, that you wouldn't

2:12:10.440 --> 2:12:16.440
 even dare cover in your graduation, um, uh, commencement speech. Uh, what's the meaning

2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:23.720
 of life? Why are we here? This whole project that history studies and analyzes as if, as

2:12:23.720 --> 2:12:32.240
 if there's a point to the whole thing. What is the point? All the wars, all the presidents,

2:12:32.240 --> 2:12:37.800
 all the struggles to discover what it means to be human of, uh, or reach for a higher

2:12:37.800 --> 2:12:48.400
 ideal. Why? Why do you think we're here? Hmm. I think this is where there is often a handoff

2:12:48.400 --> 2:12:58.920
 from the historian, um, to the clergy, um, you know, who, but in the end, um, uh, it's

2:12:58.920 --> 2:13:05.040
 less of there's less distance between the two than you think. Right. That, um, you know,

2:13:05.040 --> 2:13:09.400
 if you think about some of the kind of, uh, answers to that question, what is the meaning

2:13:09.400 --> 2:13:17.120
 of life that are given from religious traditions? Um, often they have a fundamentally historical

2:13:17.120 --> 2:13:24.240
 core, right? It's about, you know, unifying the past and the present, um, in some other,

2:13:24.240 --> 2:13:31.400
 you know, non earthly, um, sort of dimension. Uh, and you know, so I think there is that,

2:13:31.400 --> 2:13:37.400
 I think even for people who, who don't have a religious belief and there's a way in which

2:13:37.400 --> 2:13:44.840
 history, um, is about the shared, the shared human condition. Um, and I think historians

2:13:44.840 --> 2:13:51.800
 aspire to telling all of that story, right? Um, you know, we, we drill down on the, on

2:13:51.800 --> 2:13:57.520
 the miseries of, of war and depressions and, and so forth. But, um, but you know, the story

2:13:57.520 --> 2:14:03.720
 is not complete without, you know, blueberries and butterflies and, and, and, and all the

2:14:03.720 --> 2:14:14.280
 rest that, that go with it. So both the humbling and the inspiring aspect that you get by looking

2:14:14.280 --> 2:14:22.080
 back at human history that, uh, we're in this together. Christopher, this is a huge honor.

2:14:22.080 --> 2:14:26.720
 This is an amazing conversation. Thank you for taking us back to a war that, uh, not

2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:32.200
 often discussed, but in many ways defined the 20, the 20th century and the century we

2:14:32.200 --> 2:14:37.920
 are in today, which is the first world war, the war that was supposed to end all wars,

2:14:37.920 --> 2:14:43.360
 but instead defined the future wars and defines our struggle to, to try to avoid the world

2:14:43.360 --> 2:14:49.080
 war three. So it's a huge honor you talk with me today. This is amazing. Thank you so much.

2:14:49.080 --> 2:14:54.360
 Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Christopher Capozzola. To support this

2:14:54.360 --> 2:14:58.800
 podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you

2:14:58.800 --> 2:15:05.760
 some words from Woodrow Wilson in 1917 about world war one that haunted the rest of the

2:15:05.760 --> 2:15:14.600
 20th century. This is a war to end all wars. George Santana, a Spanish American philosopher

2:15:14.600 --> 2:15:24.440
 responded to this quote in 1922 by saying, only the dead have seen the end of war. Thank

2:15:24.440 --> 2:15:37.760
 you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
