00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
 Evolutionarily, if we see a lion running at us,

00:03.040 --> 00:05.040
 we didn't have time to sort of calculate

00:05.040 --> 00:08.040
 the lion's kinetic energy and is it optimal

00:08.040 --> 00:10.440
 to go this way or that way, you just react it.

00:10.440 --> 00:13.240
 And physically our bodies are well attuned

00:13.240 --> 00:14.540
 to actually make right decisions.

00:14.540 --> 00:16.640
 But when you're playing a game like poker,

00:16.640 --> 00:19.320
 this is not something that you ever evolved to do.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.360
 And yet you're in that same flight or fight response.

00:22.360 --> 00:24.440
 And so that's a really important skill

00:24.440 --> 00:25.900
 to be able to develop to basically learn

00:25.900 --> 00:29.100
 how to like meditate in the moment and calm yourself

00:29.100 --> 00:30.600
 so that you can think clearly.

00:32.520 --> 00:35.740
 The following is a conversation with Liv Burry,

00:35.740 --> 00:38.380
 formerly one of the best poker players in the world,

00:38.380 --> 00:42.880
 trained as an astrophysicist and is now a philanthropist

00:42.880 --> 00:45.780
 and an educator on topics of game theory,

00:45.780 --> 00:48.280
 physics, complexity, and life.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.080
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.200
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:53.200 --> 00:54.440
 in the description.

00:54.440 --> 00:57.680
 And now, dear friends, here's Liv Burry.

00:57.680 --> 01:02.580
 What role do you think luck plays in poker and in life?

01:02.580 --> 01:04.260
 You can pick whichever one you want,

01:04.260 --> 01:06.940
 poker or life and or life.

01:06.940 --> 01:10.900
 The longer you play, the less influence luck has.

01:10.900 --> 01:13.900
 Like with all things, the bigger your sample size,

01:13.900 --> 01:16.380
 the more the quality of your decisions

01:16.380 --> 01:17.940
 or your strategies matter.

01:18.860 --> 01:21.580
 So to answer that question, yeah, in poker,

01:21.580 --> 01:22.780
 it really depends.

01:22.780 --> 01:26.120
 If you and I sat and played 10 hands right now,

01:26.120 --> 01:30.260
 I might only win 52% of the time, 53% maybe.

01:30.260 --> 01:31.740
 But if we played 10,000 hands,

01:31.740 --> 01:35.180
 then I'll probably win like over 98, 99% of the time.

01:35.180 --> 01:38.180
 So it's a question of sample sizes.

01:38.180 --> 01:40.120
 And what are you figuring out over time?

01:40.120 --> 01:42.260
 The betting strategy that this individual does

01:42.260 --> 01:43.740
 or literally it doesn't matter

01:43.740 --> 01:45.920
 against any individual over time?

01:45.920 --> 01:47.980
 Against any individual over time, the better player

01:47.980 --> 01:49.520
 because they're making better decisions.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.260
 So what does that mean to make a better decision?

01:51.260 --> 01:55.340
 Well, to get into the realness of Gritty already,

01:55.340 --> 01:57.820
 basically poker is a game of math.

01:58.780 --> 02:00.380
 There are these strategies familiar

02:00.380 --> 02:02.580
 with like Nash Equilibria, right?

02:02.580 --> 02:06.340
 So there are these game theory optimal strategies

02:06.340 --> 02:08.340
 that you can adopt.

02:08.340 --> 02:10.380
 And the closer you play to them,

02:10.380 --> 02:12.420
 the less exploitable you are.

02:12.420 --> 02:15.980
 So because I've studied the game a bunch,

02:15.980 --> 02:17.300
 although admittedly not for a few years,

02:17.300 --> 02:20.060
 but back when I was playing all the time,

02:20.060 --> 02:23.060
 I would study these game theory optimal solutions

02:23.060 --> 02:24.940
 and try and then adopt those strategies

02:24.940 --> 02:25.780
 when I go and play.

02:25.780 --> 02:27.760
 So I'd play against you and I would do that.

02:27.760 --> 02:31.860
 And because the objective,

02:31.860 --> 02:33.260
 when you're playing game theory optimal,

02:33.260 --> 02:36.020
 it's actually, it's a loss minimization thing

02:36.020 --> 02:37.380
 that you're trying to do.

02:37.380 --> 02:42.380
 Your best bet is to try and play a sort of similar style.

02:42.760 --> 02:46.220
 You also need to try and adopt this loss minimization.

02:46.220 --> 02:48.140
 But because I've been playing much longer than you,

02:48.140 --> 02:49.420
 I'll be better at that.

02:49.420 --> 02:51.940
 So first of all, you're not taking advantage

02:51.940 --> 02:53.180
 of my mistakes.

02:53.180 --> 02:55.020
 But then on top of that,

02:55.020 --> 02:56.940
 I'll be better at recognizing

02:56.940 --> 02:59.540
 when you are playing suboptimally

02:59.540 --> 03:02.220
 and then deviating from this game theory optimal strategy

03:02.220 --> 03:05.140
 to exploit your bad plays.

03:05.140 --> 03:08.700
 Can you define game theory and Nash equilibria?

03:08.700 --> 03:10.980
 Can we try to sneak up to it in a bunch of ways?

03:10.980 --> 03:14.380
 Like what's a game theory framework of analyzing poker,

03:14.380 --> 03:16.340
 analyzing any kind of situation?

03:16.340 --> 03:21.340
 So game theory is just basically the study of decisions

03:21.340 --> 03:24.540
 within a competitive situation.

03:24.540 --> 03:26.780
 I mean, it's technically a branch of economics,

03:26.780 --> 03:30.380
 but it also applies to like wider decision theory.

03:30.380 --> 03:35.380
 And usually when you see it,

03:35.380 --> 03:37.900
 it's these like little payoff matrices and so on.

03:37.900 --> 03:38.780
 That's how it's depicted.

03:38.780 --> 03:41.140
 But it's essentially just like study of strategies

03:41.140 --> 03:42.940
 under different competitive situations.

03:42.940 --> 03:46.360
 And as it happens, certain games,

03:46.360 --> 03:48.820
 in fact, many, many games have these things

03:48.820 --> 03:50.460
 called Nash equilibria.

03:50.460 --> 03:52.420
 And what that means is when you're in a Nash equilibrium,

03:52.420 --> 03:55.460
 basically it is not,

03:55.460 --> 03:59.700
 there is no strategy that you can take

03:59.700 --> 04:01.180
 that would be more beneficial

04:01.180 --> 04:02.780
 than the one you're currently taking,

04:02.780 --> 04:05.700
 assuming your opponent is also doing the same thing.

04:05.700 --> 04:06.740
 So it'd be a bad idea,

04:06.740 --> 04:10.660
 if we're both playing in a game theory optimal strategy,

04:10.660 --> 04:12.140
 if either of us deviate from that,

04:12.140 --> 04:16.620
 now we're putting ourselves at a disadvantage.

04:16.620 --> 04:17.460
 Rock, paper, scissors

04:17.460 --> 04:18.840
 is actually a really great example of this.

04:18.840 --> 04:22.380
 Like if we were to start playing rock, paper, scissors,

04:22.380 --> 04:23.740
 you know, you know nothing about me

04:23.740 --> 04:26.180
 and we're gonna play for all our money,

04:26.180 --> 04:27.820
 let's play 10 rounds of it.

04:27.820 --> 04:30.220
 What would your sort of optimal strategy be?

04:30.220 --> 04:31.860
 Do you think, what would you do?

04:33.640 --> 04:35.180
 Let's see.

04:35.180 --> 04:40.180
 I would probably try to be as random as possible.

04:42.580 --> 04:43.500
 Exactly.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.000
 You wanna, because you don't know anything about me,

04:46.000 --> 04:48.100
 you don't want to give anything away about yourself.

04:48.100 --> 04:49.540
 So ideally you'd have like a little dice

04:49.540 --> 04:52.560
 or somewhat, you know, perfect randomizer

04:52.560 --> 04:54.500
 that makes you randomize 33% of the time

04:54.500 --> 04:56.060
 each of the three different things.

04:56.060 --> 04:58.140
 And in response to that,

04:58.140 --> 04:59.620
 well, actually I can kind of do anything,

04:59.620 --> 05:01.380
 but I would probably just randomize back too,

05:01.380 --> 05:02.400
 but actually it wouldn't matter

05:02.400 --> 05:05.140
 because I know that you're playing randomly.

05:05.140 --> 05:07.620
 So that would be us in a Nash equilibrium

05:07.620 --> 05:10.620
 where we're both playing this like unexploitable strategy.

05:10.620 --> 05:13.020
 However, if after a while you then notice

05:13.020 --> 05:16.380
 that I'm playing rock a little bit more often than I should.

05:16.380 --> 05:18.140
 Yeah, you're the kind of person that would do that,

05:18.140 --> 05:18.980
 wouldn't you?

05:18.980 --> 05:19.800
 Sure.

05:19.800 --> 05:20.640
 Yes, yes, yes.

05:20.640 --> 05:21.460
 I'm more of a scissors girl, but anyway.

05:21.460 --> 05:22.500
 You are?

05:22.500 --> 05:24.420
 No, I'm a, as I said, randomizer.

05:25.580 --> 05:27.140
 So you notice I'm throwing rock too much

05:27.140 --> 05:28.140
 or something like that.

05:28.140 --> 05:29.300
 Now you'd be making a mistake

05:29.300 --> 05:32.180
 by continuing playing this game theory optimal strategy,

05:32.180 --> 05:35.420
 well, the previous one, because you are now,

05:36.660 --> 05:39.060
 I'm making a mistake and you're not deviating

05:39.060 --> 05:41.300
 and exploiting my mistake.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.800
 So you'd want to start throwing paper a bit more often

05:43.800 --> 05:45.940
 in whatever you figure is the right sort of percentage

05:45.940 --> 05:48.060
 of the time that I'm throwing rock too often.

05:48.060 --> 05:51.460
 So that's basically an example of where,

05:51.460 --> 05:53.260
 what game theory optimal strategy is

05:53.260 --> 05:54.660
 in terms of loss minimization,

05:54.660 --> 05:58.020
 but it's not always the maximally profitable thing

05:58.020 --> 06:00.140
 if your opponent is doing stupid stuff,

06:00.140 --> 06:02.560
 which in that example.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.500
 So that's kind of then how it works in poker,

06:04.500 --> 06:06.420
 but it's a lot more complex.

06:07.380 --> 06:10.620
 And the way poker players typically,

06:10.620 --> 06:12.900
 nowadays they study, the games change so much.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.420
 And I think we should talk about how it sort of evolved,

06:15.420 --> 06:17.780
 but nowadays like the top pros

06:17.780 --> 06:20.820
 basically spend all their time in between sessions

06:20.820 --> 06:24.220
 running these simulators using like software

06:24.220 --> 06:26.140
 where they do basically Monte Carlo simulations,

06:26.140 --> 06:31.140
 sort of doing billions of fictitious self play hands.

06:31.140 --> 06:34.020
 You input a fictitious hand scenario,

06:34.020 --> 06:36.060
 like, oh, what do I do with Jack nine suited

06:36.060 --> 06:40.340
 on a King 10 four to two spades board

06:41.980 --> 06:43.940
 and against this bet size.

06:43.940 --> 06:45.780
 So you'd input that press play,

06:45.780 --> 06:49.340
 it'll run its billions of fake hands

06:49.340 --> 06:50.340
 and then it will converge upon

06:50.340 --> 06:52.540
 what the game theory optimal strategies are.

06:53.460 --> 06:55.420
 And then you wanna try and memorize what these are.

06:55.420 --> 06:57.480
 Basically they're like ratios of how often,

06:57.480 --> 06:59.900
 what types of hands you want to bluff

06:59.900 --> 07:01.300
 and what percentage of the time.

07:01.300 --> 07:02.780
 So then there's this additional layer

07:02.780 --> 07:04.460
 of inbuilt randomization built in.

07:04.460 --> 07:06.420
 Yeah, those kinds of simulations incorporate

07:06.420 --> 07:09.460
 all the betting strategies and everything else like that.

07:09.460 --> 07:12.340
 So as opposed to some kind of very crude mathematical model

07:12.340 --> 07:13.860
 of what's the probability you win

07:13.860 --> 07:16.380
 just based on the quality of the card,

07:16.380 --> 07:18.980
 it's including everything else too.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.220
 The game theory of it.

07:20.220 --> 07:21.980
 Yes, yeah, essentially.

07:21.980 --> 07:23.780
 And what's interesting is that nowadays,

07:23.780 --> 07:25.620
 if you want to be a top pro and you go and play

07:25.620 --> 07:27.540
 in these really like the super high stakes tournaments

07:27.540 --> 07:30.700
 or tough cash games, if you don't know this stuff,

07:30.700 --> 07:33.260
 you're gonna get eaten alive in the long run.

07:33.260 --> 07:35.160
 But of course you could get lucky over the short run

07:35.160 --> 07:36.860
 and that's where this like luck factor comes in

07:36.860 --> 07:40.400
 because luck is both a blessing and a curse.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.580
 If luck didn't, if there wasn't this random element

07:42.580 --> 07:45.260
 and there wasn't the ability for worse players

07:45.260 --> 07:48.220
 to win sometimes, then poker would fall apart.

07:48.220 --> 07:50.980
 You know, the same reason people don't play chess

07:50.980 --> 07:53.380
 professionally for money against,

07:53.380 --> 07:55.500
 you don't see people going and hustling chess

07:55.500 --> 07:57.860
 like not knowing, trying to make a living from it

07:57.860 --> 08:00.140
 because you know there's very little luck in chess,

08:00.140 --> 08:01.420
 but there's quite a lot of luck in poker.

08:01.420 --> 08:03.940
 Have you seen Beautiful Mind, that movie?

08:03.940 --> 08:04.780
 Years ago.

08:04.780 --> 08:07.220
 Well, what do you think about the game theoretic formulation

08:07.220 --> 08:09.980
 of what is it, the hot blonde at the bar?

08:09.980 --> 08:10.820
 Do you remember?

08:10.820 --> 08:11.660
 Oh, yeah.

08:11.660 --> 08:14.860
 What they illustrated is they're trying to pick up a girl

08:14.860 --> 08:16.460
 at a bar and there's multiple girls.

08:16.460 --> 08:18.140
 They're like friend, it's like a friend group

08:18.140 --> 08:20.100
 and you're trying to approach,

08:20.100 --> 08:21.980
 I don't remember the details, but I remember.

08:21.980 --> 08:24.340
 Don't you like then speak to her friends first

08:24.340 --> 08:25.700
 or something like that, feign disinterest.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.420
 I mean, it's classic pickup artist stuff, right?

08:27.420 --> 08:28.260
 You wanna.

08:28.260 --> 08:30.780
 And they were trying to correlate that somehow,

08:30.780 --> 08:35.360
 that being an optimal strategy game theoretically.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.740
 Why?

08:36.740 --> 08:38.940
 What, what, like, I don't think, I remember.

08:38.940 --> 08:39.780
 I can't imagine that there is,

08:39.780 --> 08:41.940
 I mean, there's probably an optimal strategy.

08:41.940 --> 08:45.020
 Is it, does that mean that there's an actual Nash equilibrium

08:45.020 --> 08:46.660
 of like picking up girls?

08:46.660 --> 08:49.020
 Do you know the marriage problem?

08:49.020 --> 08:50.940
 It's optimal stopping.

08:50.940 --> 08:51.780
 Yes.

08:51.780 --> 08:54.180
 So where it's an optimal dating strategy

08:54.180 --> 08:56.580
 where you, do you remember what it is?

08:56.580 --> 08:57.580
 Yeah, I think it's like something like,

08:57.580 --> 08:59.920
 you know you've got like a set of a hundred people

08:59.920 --> 09:01.900
 you're gonna look through and after,

09:01.900 --> 09:05.620
 how many do you, now after that,

09:05.620 --> 09:08.020
 after going on this many dates out of a hundred,

09:08.020 --> 09:10.780
 at what point do you then go, okay, the next best person I see,

09:10.780 --> 09:11.620
 is that the right one?

09:11.620 --> 09:14.700
 And I think it's like something like 37%.

09:14.700 --> 09:17.740
 Uh, it's one over E, whatever that is.

09:17.740 --> 09:19.260
 Right, which I think is 37%.

09:19.260 --> 09:20.100
 Yeah.

09:21.260 --> 09:22.860
 We're gonna fact check that.

09:24.860 --> 09:25.700
 Yeah.

09:25.700 --> 09:28.420
 So, but it's funny under those strict constraints,

09:28.420 --> 09:30.660
 then yes, after that many people,

09:30.660 --> 09:32.900
 as long as you have a fixed size pool,

09:32.900 --> 09:36.460
 then you just pick the next person

09:36.460 --> 09:38.460
 that is better than anyone you've seen before.

09:38.460 --> 09:40.340
 Anyone else you've seen, yeah.

09:40.340 --> 09:41.780
 Have you tried this?

09:41.780 --> 09:42.620
 Have you incorporated it?

09:42.620 --> 09:44.660
 I'm not one of those people.

09:44.660 --> 09:45.820
 And we're gonna discuss this.

09:45.820 --> 09:49.820
 I, and, what do you mean, those people?

09:49.820 --> 09:52.560
 I try not to optimize stuff.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.300
 I try to listen to the heart.

09:55.300 --> 09:59.780
 I don't think, I like,

09:59.780 --> 10:04.300
 my mind immediately is attracted to optimizing everything.

10:04.300 --> 10:06.220
 Optimizing everything.

10:06.220 --> 10:09.900
 And I think that if you really give in

10:09.900 --> 10:11.060
 to that kind of addiction,

10:11.060 --> 10:14.880
 that you lose the joy of the small things,

10:14.880 --> 10:17.180
 the minutiae of life, I think.

10:17.180 --> 10:18.020
 I don't know.

10:18.020 --> 10:19.780
 I'm concerned about the addictive nature

10:19.780 --> 10:21.600
 of my personality in that regard.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.740
 In some ways,

10:24.760 --> 10:26.520
 while I think the, on average,

10:26.520 --> 10:30.140
 people under try and quantify things,

10:30.140 --> 10:32.500
 or try, under optimize.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.100
 There are some people who, you know,

10:34.100 --> 10:37.140
 with all these things, it's a balancing act.

10:37.140 --> 10:40.180
 I've been on dating apps, but I've never used them.

10:40.180 --> 10:42.060
 I'm sure they have data on this,

10:42.060 --> 10:43.060
 because they probably have

10:43.060 --> 10:45.260
 the optimal stopping control problem.

10:45.260 --> 10:47.380
 Because there aren't a lot of people that use social,

10:47.380 --> 10:51.020
 like dating apps, are on there for a long time.

10:51.020 --> 10:56.020
 So the interesting aspect is like, all right,

10:56.300 --> 10:58.740
 how long before you stop looking

10:58.740 --> 11:01.720
 before it actually starts affecting your mind negatively,

11:01.720 --> 11:05.080
 such that you see dating as a kind of,

11:07.380 --> 11:08.220
 A game.

11:08.220 --> 11:12.780
 A kind of game versus an actual process

11:12.780 --> 11:14.420
 of finding somebody that's going to make you happy

11:14.420 --> 11:15.780
 for the rest of your life.

11:15.780 --> 11:17.340
 That's really interesting.

11:17.340 --> 11:18.180
 They have the data.

11:18.180 --> 11:20.420
 I wish they would be able to release that data.

11:20.420 --> 11:21.260
 And I do want to hop to it.

11:21.260 --> 11:22.220
 It's OkCupid, right?

11:22.220 --> 11:25.320
 I think they ran a huge, huge study on all of that.

11:25.320 --> 11:28.060
 Yeah, they're more data driven, I think, OkCupid folks are.

11:28.060 --> 11:30.220
 I think there's a lot of opportunity for dating apps,

11:30.220 --> 11:32.340
 in general, even bigger than dating apps,

11:32.340 --> 11:35.020
 people connecting on the internet.

11:35.020 --> 11:37.580
 I just hope they're more data driven.

11:37.580 --> 11:40.340
 And it doesn't seem that way.

11:40.340 --> 11:43.380
 I think like, I've always thought that

11:44.780 --> 11:47.900
 Goodreads should be a dating app.

11:47.900 --> 11:48.740
 Like the.

11:48.740 --> 11:49.580
 I've never used it.

11:49.580 --> 11:50.400
 After what?

11:50.400 --> 11:55.140
 Goodreads is just lists like books that you've read.

11:55.140 --> 11:57.360
 And allows you to comment on the books you read

11:57.360 --> 11:58.940
 and what books you're currently reading.

11:58.940 --> 12:01.340
 But it's a giant social networks of people reading books.

12:01.340 --> 12:03.380
 And that seems to be a much better database

12:03.380 --> 12:04.620
 of like interests.

12:04.620 --> 12:06.580
 Of course it constrains you to the books you're reading,

12:06.580 --> 12:10.220
 but like that really reveals so much more about the person.

12:10.220 --> 12:12.460
 Allows you to discover shared interests

12:12.460 --> 12:13.940
 because books are a kind of window

12:13.940 --> 12:16.020
 into the way you see the world.

12:16.020 --> 12:19.220
 Also like the kind of places,

12:19.220 --> 12:20.340
 people you're curious about,

12:20.340 --> 12:21.700
 the kind of ideas you're curious about.

12:21.700 --> 12:24.860
 Are you a romantic or are you cold calculating rationalist?

12:24.860 --> 12:28.260
 Are you into Ayn Rand or are you into Bernie Sanders?

12:28.260 --> 12:29.940
 Are you into whatever?

12:29.940 --> 12:31.980
 And I feel like that reveals so much more

12:31.980 --> 12:35.220
 than like a person trying to look hot

12:35.220 --> 12:37.100
 from a certain angle in a Tinder profile.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.940
 Well, and it'd also be a really great filter

12:38.940 --> 12:40.340
 in the first place for people.

12:40.340 --> 12:41.940
 It's less people who read books

12:41.940 --> 12:44.700
 and are willing to go and rate them

12:44.700 --> 12:47.020
 and give feedback on them and so on.

12:47.020 --> 12:48.820
 So that's already a really strong filter.

12:48.820 --> 12:50.600
 Probably the type of people you'd be looking for.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.380
 Well, at least be able to fake reading books.

12:52.380 --> 12:53.540
 I mean, the thing about books,

12:53.540 --> 12:54.500
 you don't really need to read it.

12:54.500 --> 12:55.860
 You can just look at the click counts.

12:55.860 --> 12:59.060
 Yeah, game the dating app by feigning intellectualism.

12:59.060 --> 13:02.340
 Can I admit something very horrible about myself?

13:02.340 --> 13:03.180
 Go on.

13:03.180 --> 13:04.300
 The things that, you know,

13:04.300 --> 13:05.700
 I don't have many things in my closet,

13:05.700 --> 13:06.900
 but this is one of them.

13:07.980 --> 13:10.700
 I've never actually read Shakespeare.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.340
 I've only read Cliff Notes

13:12.340 --> 13:15.020
 and I got a five in the AP English exam.

13:15.020 --> 13:15.860
 Wow.

13:15.860 --> 13:16.700
 And I...

13:16.700 --> 13:18.020
 Which book?

13:18.020 --> 13:19.660
 The which books have I read?

13:19.660 --> 13:21.500
 Oh yeah, which was the exam on which book?

13:21.500 --> 13:23.180
 Oh no, they include a lot of them.

13:23.180 --> 13:24.260
 Oh.

13:24.260 --> 13:27.140
 But Hamlet, I don't even know

13:27.140 --> 13:30.060
 if you read Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.660
 I don't remember, but I don't understand it.

13:32.660 --> 13:34.060
 It's like really cryptic.

13:34.060 --> 13:34.900
 It's hard.

13:34.900 --> 13:37.980
 It's really, I don't, and it's not that pleasant to read.

13:37.980 --> 13:39.180
 It's like ancient speak.

13:39.180 --> 13:40.300
 I don't understand it.

13:40.300 --> 13:41.780
 Anyway, maybe I was too dumb.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.780
 I'm still too dumb, but I did get...

13:44.780 --> 13:45.820
 You got a five, which is...

13:45.820 --> 13:46.660
 Yeah, yeah.

13:46.660 --> 13:47.980
 I don't know how the US grading system...

13:47.980 --> 13:50.380
 Oh no, so AP English is a,

13:50.380 --> 13:53.060
 there's kind of this advanced versions of courses

13:53.060 --> 13:54.900
 in high school, and you take a test

13:54.900 --> 13:57.940
 that is like a broad test for that subject

13:57.940 --> 13:58.900
 and includes a lot.

13:58.900 --> 14:00.580
 It wasn't obviously just Shakespeare.

14:00.580 --> 14:04.900
 I think a lot of it was also writing, written.

14:04.900 --> 14:07.140
 You have like AP Physics, AP Computer Science,

14:07.140 --> 14:11.140
 AP Biology, AP Chemistry, and then AP English

14:11.140 --> 14:13.460
 or AP Literature, I forget what it was.

14:13.460 --> 14:16.020
 But I think Shakespeare was a part of that.

14:16.020 --> 14:16.860
 But I...

14:16.860 --> 14:19.140
 And the point is you gamified it?

14:19.140 --> 14:19.980
 Gamified.

14:19.980 --> 14:22.580
 Well, in entirety, I was into getting As.

14:22.580 --> 14:24.180
 I saw it as a game.

14:24.180 --> 14:25.860
 I don't think any...

14:27.060 --> 14:30.340
 I don't think all of the learning I've done

14:30.340 --> 14:33.940
 has been outside of school.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.220
 The deepest learning I've done has been outside of school

14:36.220 --> 14:38.380
 with a few exceptions, especially in grad school,

14:38.380 --> 14:40.420
 like deep computer science courses.

14:40.420 --> 14:41.780
 But that was still outside of school

14:41.780 --> 14:43.180
 because it was outside of getting...

14:43.180 --> 14:44.020
 Sorry.

14:44.020 --> 14:46.180
 It was outside of getting the A for the course.

14:46.180 --> 14:49.620
 The best stuff I've ever done is when you read the chapter

14:49.620 --> 14:52.300
 and you do many of the problems at the end of the chapter,

14:52.300 --> 14:54.900
 which is usually not what's required for the course,

14:54.900 --> 14:56.140
 like the hardest stuff.

14:56.140 --> 14:58.780
 In fact, textbooks are freaking incredible.

14:58.780 --> 15:02.220
 If you go back now and you look at like biology textbook

15:02.220 --> 15:06.060
 or any of the computer science textbooks

15:06.060 --> 15:07.740
 on algorithms and data structures,

15:07.740 --> 15:09.500
 those things are incredibly...

15:09.500 --> 15:11.940
 They have the best summary of a subject,

15:11.940 --> 15:15.300
 plus they have practice problems of increasing difficulty

15:15.300 --> 15:17.700
 that allows you to truly master the basic,

15:17.700 --> 15:19.900
 like the fundamental ideas behind that.

15:19.900 --> 15:24.380
 I got through my entire physics degree with one textbook

15:24.380 --> 15:26.260
 that was just this really comprehensive one

15:26.260 --> 15:28.620
 that they told us at the beginning of the first year,

15:28.620 --> 15:31.660
 buy this, but you're gonna have to buy 15 other books

15:31.660 --> 15:33.340
 for all your supplementary courses.

15:33.340 --> 15:35.500
 And I was like, every time I was just checked

15:35.500 --> 15:38.020
 to see whether this book covered it and it did.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.820
 And I think I only bought like two or three extra

15:39.820 --> 15:41.900
 and thank God, cause they're super expensive textbooks.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.300
 It's a whole racket they've got going on.

15:44.300 --> 15:45.140
 Yeah, they are.

15:45.140 --> 15:46.220
 They could just...

15:46.220 --> 15:49.500
 You get the right one, it's just like a manual for...

15:49.500 --> 15:51.380
 But what's interesting though,

15:51.380 --> 15:56.380
 is this is the tyranny of having exams and metrics.

15:56.780 --> 15:58.660
 The tyranny of exams and metrics, yes.

15:58.660 --> 16:00.980
 I loved them because I'm very competitive

16:00.980 --> 16:04.020
 and I liked finding ways to gamify things

16:04.020 --> 16:06.380
 and then like sort of dust off my shoulders afterwards

16:06.380 --> 16:07.420
 when I get a good grade

16:07.420 --> 16:09.620
 or be annoyed at myself when I didn't.

16:09.620 --> 16:10.860
 But yeah, you're absolutely right.

16:10.860 --> 16:12.820
 And that the actual...

16:12.820 --> 16:15.700
 How much of that physics knowledge I've retained,

16:15.700 --> 16:19.660
 like I've learned how to cram and study

16:19.660 --> 16:21.340
 and please an examiner,

16:21.340 --> 16:23.980
 but did that give me the deep lasting knowledge

16:23.980 --> 16:24.820
 that I needed?

16:24.820 --> 16:27.020
 I mean, yes and no,

16:27.020 --> 16:30.980
 but really like nothing makes you learn a topic better

16:30.980 --> 16:34.260
 than when you actually then have to teach it yourself.

16:34.260 --> 16:35.860
 Like I'm trying to wrap my teeth

16:35.860 --> 16:38.180
 around this like game theory Moloch stuff right now.

16:38.180 --> 16:43.060
 And there's no exam at the end of it that I can gamify.

16:43.060 --> 16:43.980
 There's no way to gamify

16:43.980 --> 16:45.380
 and sort of like shortcut my way through it.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.260
 I have to understand it so deeply

16:47.260 --> 16:49.660
 from like deep foundational levels

16:49.660 --> 16:50.700
 to then to build upon it

16:50.700 --> 16:52.340
 and then try and explain it to other people.

16:52.340 --> 16:54.460
 And like, you're about to go and do some lectures, right?

16:54.460 --> 16:57.620
 You can't sort of just like,

16:58.620 --> 17:00.660
 you presumably can't rely on the knowledge

17:00.660 --> 17:03.460
 that you got through when you were studying for an exam

17:03.460 --> 17:04.860
 to reteach that.

17:04.860 --> 17:06.860
 Yeah, and especially high level lectures,

17:06.860 --> 17:09.420
 especially the kind of stuff you do on YouTube,

17:09.420 --> 17:12.780
 you're not just regurgitating material.

17:12.780 --> 17:17.780
 You have to think through what is the core idea here.

17:17.940 --> 17:20.780
 And when you do the lectures live especially,

17:20.780 --> 17:23.940
 you have to, there's no second takes.

17:25.020 --> 17:27.100
 That is the luxury you get

17:27.100 --> 17:28.980
 if you're recording a video for YouTube

17:28.980 --> 17:30.220
 or something like that.

17:30.220 --> 17:34.020
 But it definitely is a luxury you shouldn't lean on.

17:35.060 --> 17:37.340
 I've gotten to interact with a few YouTubers

17:37.340 --> 17:39.300
 that lean on that too much.

17:39.300 --> 17:43.380
 And you realize, oh, you've gamified this system

17:43.380 --> 17:46.740
 because you're not really thinking deeply about stuff.

17:46.740 --> 17:48.420
 You're through the edit,

17:48.420 --> 17:52.220
 both written and spoken,

17:52.220 --> 17:53.900
 you're crafting an amazing video,

17:53.900 --> 17:55.460
 but you yourself as a human being

17:55.460 --> 17:57.620
 have not really deeply understood it.

17:57.620 --> 18:00.780
 So live teaching or at least recording video

18:00.780 --> 18:04.700
 with very few takes is a different beast.

18:04.700 --> 18:07.300
 And I think it's the most honest way of doing it,

18:07.300 --> 18:09.420
 like as few takes as possible.

18:09.420 --> 18:10.780
 That's why I'm nervous about this.

18:10.780 --> 18:14.020
 Don't go back and be like, ah, let's do that.

18:14.020 --> 18:15.500
 Don't fuck this up, Liv.

18:17.220 --> 18:18.500
 The tyranny of exams.

18:18.500 --> 18:23.500
 I do think people talk about high school and college

18:24.220 --> 18:27.220
 as a time to do drugs and drink and have fun

18:27.220 --> 18:28.340
 and all this kind of stuff.

18:28.340 --> 18:33.340
 But looking back, of course I did a lot of those things.

18:33.340 --> 18:38.340
 Yes, no, yes, but it's also a time

18:39.020 --> 18:43.620
 when you get to read textbooks or read books

18:43.620 --> 18:48.740
 or learn with all the time in the world.

18:48.740 --> 18:51.740
 You don't have these responsibilities of laundry

18:54.860 --> 18:59.860
 and having to sort of pay for mortgage,

18:59.860 --> 19:03.020
 all that kind of stuff, pay taxes, all this kind of stuff.

19:03.020 --> 19:06.500
 In most cases, there's just so much time in the day

19:06.500 --> 19:09.420
 for learning and you don't realize it at the time

19:09.420 --> 19:11.100
 because at the time it seems like a chore,

19:11.100 --> 19:14.660
 like why the hell does there's so much homework?

19:14.660 --> 19:17.220
 But you never get a chance to do this kind of learning,

19:17.220 --> 19:20.300
 this kind of homework ever again in life,

19:20.300 --> 19:23.860
 unless later in life you really make a big effort out of it.

19:23.860 --> 19:26.780
 Like basically your knowledge gets solidified.

19:26.780 --> 19:28.380
 You don't get to have fun and learn.

19:28.380 --> 19:32.740
 Learning is really fulfilling and really fun

19:32.740 --> 19:33.700
 if you're that kind of person.

19:33.700 --> 19:37.220
 Like some people like, you know,

19:37.220 --> 19:39.940
 like knowledge is not something that they think is fun.

19:39.940 --> 19:43.020
 But if that's the kind of thing that you think is fun,

19:43.020 --> 19:45.620
 that's the time to have fun and do the drugs and drink

19:45.620 --> 19:46.460
 and all that kind of stuff.

19:46.460 --> 19:50.780
 But the learning, just going back to those textbooks,

19:50.780 --> 19:52.460
 the hours spent with the textbooks

19:52.460 --> 19:54.420
 is really, really rewarding.

19:54.420 --> 19:56.020
 Do people even use textbooks anymore?

19:56.020 --> 19:56.940
 Yeah. Do you think?

19:56.940 --> 20:00.300
 Kids these days with their TikTok and their...

20:00.300 --> 20:03.940
 Well, not even that, but it's just like so much information,

20:03.940 --> 20:05.260
 really high quality information,

20:05.260 --> 20:07.300
 you know, it's now in digital format online.

20:08.420 --> 20:10.340
 Yeah, but they're not, they are using that,

20:10.340 --> 20:15.340
 but you know, college is still very, there's a curriculum.

20:15.340 --> 20:18.860
 I mean, so much of school is about rigorous study

20:18.860 --> 20:22.820
 of a subject and still on YouTube, that's not there.

20:22.820 --> 20:23.900
 Right. YouTube has,

20:23.900 --> 20:27.700
 YouTube has, Grant Sanderson talks about this.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.180
 He's this math...

20:29.180 --> 20:30.060
 3Blue1Brown.

20:30.060 --> 20:31.660
 Yeah, 3Blue1Brown.

20:31.660 --> 20:33.860
 He says like, I'm not a math teacher.

20:33.860 --> 20:37.740
 I just take really cool concepts and I inspire people.

20:37.740 --> 20:39.460
 But if you wanna really learn calculus,

20:39.460 --> 20:41.820
 if you wanna really learn linear algebra,

20:41.820 --> 20:43.540
 you should do the textbook.

20:43.540 --> 20:45.220
 You should do that, you know.

20:45.220 --> 20:48.980
 And there's still the textbook industrial complex

20:48.980 --> 20:53.340
 that like charges like $200 for textbook and somehow,

20:53.340 --> 20:54.940
 I don't know, it's ridiculous.

20:56.580 --> 21:00.540
 Well, they're like, oh, sorry, new edition, edition 14.6.

21:00.540 --> 21:02.860
 Sorry, you can't use 14.5 anymore.

21:02.860 --> 21:03.700
 It's like, what's different?

21:03.700 --> 21:05.340
 We've got one paragraph different.

21:05.340 --> 21:08.900
 So we mentioned offline, Daniel Negrano.

21:08.900 --> 21:11.620
 I'm gonna get a chance to talk to him on this podcast.

21:11.620 --> 21:14.380
 And he's somebody that I found fascinating

21:14.380 --> 21:16.540
 in terms of the way he thinks about poker,

21:16.540 --> 21:18.580
 verbalizes the way he thinks about poker,

21:18.580 --> 21:20.180
 the way he plays poker.

21:20.180 --> 21:22.860
 So, and he's still pretty damn good.

21:22.860 --> 21:24.900
 He's been good for a long time.

21:24.900 --> 21:27.300
 So you mentioned that people are running

21:27.300 --> 21:30.540
 these kinds of simulations and the game of poker has changed.

21:30.540 --> 21:33.420
 Do you think he's adapting in this way?

21:33.420 --> 21:36.540
 Like the top pros, do they have to adopt this way?

21:36.540 --> 21:41.540
 Or is there still like over the years,

21:41.700 --> 21:45.300
 you basically develop this gut feeling about,

21:45.300 --> 21:48.580
 like you get to be like good the way,

21:48.580 --> 21:49.780
 like alpha zero is good.

21:49.780 --> 21:54.180
 You look at the board and somehow from the fog

21:54.180 --> 21:55.380
 comes out the right answer.

21:55.380 --> 21:58.020
 Like this is likely what they have.

21:58.020 --> 22:00.460
 This is likely the best way to move.

22:00.460 --> 22:03.100
 And you don't really, you can't really put a finger

22:03.100 --> 22:08.100
 on exactly why, but it just comes from your gut feeling.

22:08.260 --> 22:09.100
 Or no?

22:09.100 --> 22:10.580
 Yes and no.

22:10.580 --> 22:13.860
 So gut feelings are definitely very important.

22:14.740 --> 22:16.980
 You know, that we've got our two,

22:16.980 --> 22:18.180
 you can distill it down to two modes

22:18.180 --> 22:19.100
 of decision making, right?

22:19.100 --> 22:22.180
 You've got your sort of logical linear voice in your head,

22:22.180 --> 22:24.100
 system two, as it's often called,

22:24.100 --> 22:27.300
 and your system one, your gut intuition.

22:29.020 --> 22:32.420
 And historically in poker,

22:32.420 --> 22:34.380
 the very best players were playing

22:34.380 --> 22:35.980
 almost entirely by their gut.

22:37.140 --> 22:39.300
 You know, often they do some kind of inspired play

22:39.300 --> 22:40.500
 and you'd ask them why they do it

22:40.500 --> 22:43.020
 and they wouldn't really be able to explain it.

22:43.020 --> 22:46.500
 And that's not so much because their process

22:46.500 --> 22:48.620
 was unintelligible, but it was more just because

22:48.620 --> 22:51.220
 no one had the language with which to describe

22:51.220 --> 22:52.420
 what optimal strategies were

22:52.420 --> 22:54.340
 because no one really understood how poker worked.

22:54.340 --> 22:57.620
 This was before, you know, we had analysis software.

22:57.620 --> 22:59.940
 You know, no one was writing,

22:59.940 --> 23:01.540
 I guess some people would write down their hands

23:01.540 --> 23:02.740
 in a little notebook,

23:02.740 --> 23:04.620
 but there was no way to assimilate all this data

23:04.620 --> 23:05.980
 and analyze it.

23:05.980 --> 23:08.540
 But then, you know, when computers became cheaper

23:08.540 --> 23:09.980
 and software started emerging,

23:09.980 --> 23:11.540
 and then obviously online poker,

23:11.540 --> 23:14.260
 where it would like automatically save your hand histories.

23:14.260 --> 23:17.100
 Now, all of a sudden you kind of had this body of data

23:17.100 --> 23:19.620
 that you could run analysis on.

23:19.620 --> 23:22.180
 And so that's when people started to see, you know,

23:22.180 --> 23:24.260
 these mathematical solutions.

23:26.780 --> 23:31.780
 And so what that meant is the role of intuition

23:32.500 --> 23:33.940
 essentially became smaller.

23:35.540 --> 23:38.660
 And it went more into, as we talked before about,

23:38.660 --> 23:40.620
 you know, this game theory optimal style.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.340
 But also, as I said, like game theory optimal

23:43.340 --> 23:47.740
 is about loss minimization and being unexploitable.

23:47.740 --> 23:49.620
 But if you're playing against people who aren't,

23:49.620 --> 23:51.620
 because no person, no human being can play perfectly

23:51.620 --> 23:54.020
 game theory optimal in poker, not even the best AIs.

23:54.020 --> 23:55.460
 They're still like, you know,

23:55.460 --> 23:57.540
 they're 99.99% of the way there or whatever,

23:57.540 --> 23:59.260
 but it's kind of like the speed of light.

23:59.260 --> 24:01.060
 You can't reach it perfectly.

24:01.060 --> 24:03.780
 So there's still a role for intuition?

24:03.780 --> 24:05.780
 Yes, so when, yeah,

24:05.780 --> 24:08.460
 when you're playing this unexploitable style,

24:08.460 --> 24:11.420
 but when your opponents start doing something,

24:11.420 --> 24:14.140
 you know, suboptimal that you want to exploit,

24:14.140 --> 24:17.340
 well, now that's where not only your like logical brain

24:17.340 --> 24:18.700
 will need to be thinking, well, okay,

24:18.700 --> 24:21.300
 I know I have this, I'm in the sort of top end

24:21.300 --> 24:23.940
 of my range here with this hand.

24:23.940 --> 24:26.820
 So that means I need to be calling X percent of the time

24:27.780 --> 24:30.460
 and I put them on this range, et cetera.

24:30.460 --> 24:34.020
 But then sometimes you'll have this gut feeling

24:34.020 --> 24:37.300
 that will tell you, you know what, this time,

24:37.300 --> 24:40.060
 I know mathematically I'm meant to call now.

24:40.060 --> 24:42.740
 You know, I'm in the sort of top end of my range

24:42.740 --> 24:45.140
 and this is the odds I'm getting.

24:45.140 --> 24:46.300
 So the math says I should call,

24:46.300 --> 24:48.340
 but there's something in your gut saying,

24:48.340 --> 24:49.940
 they've got it this time, they've got it.

24:49.940 --> 24:54.940
 Like they're beating you, your hand is worse.

24:55.180 --> 24:56.940
 So then the real art,

24:56.940 --> 24:59.620
 this is where the last remaining art in poker,

24:59.620 --> 25:03.660
 the fuzziness is like, do you listen to your gut?

25:03.660 --> 25:06.100
 How do you quantify the strength of it?

25:06.100 --> 25:08.340
 Or can you even quantify the strength of it?

25:08.340 --> 25:13.100
 And I think that's what Daniel has.

25:13.100 --> 25:15.340
 I mean, I can't speak for how much he's studying

25:15.340 --> 25:17.740
 with the simulators and that kind of thing.

25:17.740 --> 25:22.260
 I think he has, like he must be to still be keeping up.

25:22.260 --> 25:26.340
 But he has an incredible intuition for just,

25:26.340 --> 25:29.180
 he's seen so many hands of poker in the flesh.

25:29.180 --> 25:31.860
 He's seen so many people, the way they behave

25:31.860 --> 25:33.740
 when the chips are, you know, when the money's on the line

25:33.740 --> 25:36.100
 and he've got him staring you down in the eye.

25:36.100 --> 25:37.460
 You know, he's intimidating.

25:37.460 --> 25:39.620
 He's got this like kind of X factor vibe

25:39.620 --> 25:42.180
 that he, you know, gives out.

25:42.180 --> 25:45.020
 And he talks a lot, which is an interactive element,

25:45.020 --> 25:47.180
 which is he's getting stuff from other people.

25:47.180 --> 25:48.020
 Yes, yeah.

25:48.020 --> 25:49.340
 And just like the subtlety.

25:49.340 --> 25:51.460
 So he's like, he's probing constantly.

25:51.460 --> 25:53.900
 Yeah, he's probing and he's getting this extra layer

25:53.900 --> 25:55.940
 of information that others can't.

25:55.940 --> 25:57.900
 Now that said though, he's good online as well.

25:57.900 --> 25:59.660
 You know, I don't know how, again,

25:59.660 --> 26:02.660
 would he be beating the top cash game players online?

26:02.660 --> 26:03.900
 Probably not, no.

26:03.900 --> 26:07.260
 But when he's in person and he's got that additional

26:07.260 --> 26:09.700
 layer of information, he can not only extract it,

26:09.700 --> 26:13.140
 but he knows what to do with it still so well.

26:13.140 --> 26:15.140
 There's one player who I would say is the exception

26:15.140 --> 26:15.980
 to all of this.

26:16.980 --> 26:18.940
 And he's one of my favorite people to talk about

26:18.940 --> 26:23.460
 in terms of, I think he might have cracked the simulation.

26:23.460 --> 26:24.540
 It's Phil Helmuth.

26:25.540 --> 26:27.060
 He...

26:27.060 --> 26:29.140
 In more ways than one, he's cracked the simulation,

26:29.140 --> 26:29.980
 I think.

26:29.980 --> 26:33.700
 Yeah, he somehow to this day is still

26:33.700 --> 26:36.540
 and I love you Phil, I'm not in any way knocking you.

26:37.500 --> 26:41.220
 He is still winning so much at the World Series

26:41.220 --> 26:43.100
 of Poker specifically.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.780
 He's now won 16 bracelets.

26:44.780 --> 26:46.780
 The next nearest person I think has won 10.

26:47.660 --> 26:50.100
 And he is consistently year in, year out going deep

26:50.100 --> 26:52.420
 or winning these huge field tournaments,

26:52.420 --> 26:54.580
 you know, with like 2000 people,

26:54.580 --> 26:57.060
 which statistically he should not be doing.

26:57.060 --> 27:02.060
 And yet you watch some of the plays he makes

27:02.060 --> 27:04.260
 and they make no sense, like mathematically,

27:04.260 --> 27:07.020
 they are so far from game theory optimal.

27:07.020 --> 27:08.540
 And the thing is, if you went and stuck him

27:08.540 --> 27:10.860
 in one of these high stakes cash games

27:10.860 --> 27:12.740
 with a bunch of like GTO people,

27:12.740 --> 27:14.540
 he's gonna get ripped apart.

27:14.540 --> 27:16.500
 But there's something that he has that when he's

27:16.500 --> 27:19.100
 in the halls of the World Series of Poker specifically,

27:20.420 --> 27:23.340
 amongst sort of amateurish players,

27:23.340 --> 27:26.340
 he gets them to do crazy shit like that.

27:26.340 --> 27:30.540
 And, but my little pet theory is that also,

27:30.540 --> 27:35.100
 he just, the card, he's like a wizard

27:35.100 --> 27:37.460
 and he gets the cards to do what he needs them to.

27:38.980 --> 27:43.980
 Because he just expects to win and he expects to receive,

27:43.980 --> 27:47.300
 you know, to get flopper set with a frequency far beyond

27:47.300 --> 27:50.780
 what the real percentages are.

27:50.780 --> 27:52.500
 And I don't even know if he knows what the real percentages

27:52.500 --> 27:54.700
 are, he doesn't need to, because he gets there.

27:54.700 --> 27:55.980
 I think he has found the Chico,

27:55.980 --> 27:57.380
 because when I've seen him play,

27:57.380 --> 28:01.300
 he seems to be like annoyed that the long shot thing

28:01.300 --> 28:02.140
 didn't happen.

28:02.140 --> 28:05.820
 He's like annoyed and it's almost like everybody else

28:05.820 --> 28:08.020
 is stupid because he was obviously going to win

28:08.020 --> 28:08.860
 with the spare.

28:08.860 --> 28:10.540
 If that silly thing hadn't happened.

28:10.540 --> 28:11.460
 And it's like, you don't understand,

28:11.460 --> 28:13.940
 the silly thing happens 99% of the time.

28:13.940 --> 28:15.700
 And it's a 1%, not the other way around,

28:15.700 --> 28:18.580
 but genuinely for his lived experience at the World Series,

28:18.580 --> 28:21.540
 only at the World Series of Poker, it is like that.

28:21.540 --> 28:24.020
 So I don't blame him for feeling that way.

28:24.020 --> 28:26.460
 But he does, he has this X factor

28:26.460 --> 28:29.940
 and the poker community has tried for years

28:29.940 --> 28:32.740
 to rip him down saying like, he's no good,

28:32.740 --> 28:34.540
 but he's clearly good because he's still winning

28:34.540 --> 28:36.220
 or there's something going on.

28:36.220 --> 28:39.140
 Whether that's he's figured out how to mess

28:39.140 --> 28:42.580
 with the fabric of reality and how cards,

28:42.580 --> 28:44.300
 a randomly shuffled deck of cards come out.

28:44.300 --> 28:46.660
 I don't know what it is, but he's doing it right still.

28:46.660 --> 28:48.700
 Who do you think is the greatest of all time?

28:48.700 --> 28:49.860
 Would you put Hellmuth?

28:52.340 --> 28:54.660
 Not Hellmuth definitely, he seems like the kind of person

28:54.660 --> 28:56.460
 when mentioned he would actually watch this.

28:56.460 --> 28:58.380
 So you might wanna be careful.

28:58.380 --> 29:02.420
 Well, as I said, I love Phil and I have,

29:02.420 --> 29:04.180
 I would say this to his face, I'm not saying anything.

29:04.180 --> 29:06.980
 I don't, he's got, he truly, I mean,

29:06.980 --> 29:09.540
 he is one of the greatest.

29:09.540 --> 29:10.980
 I don't know if he's the greatest,

29:10.980 --> 29:14.300
 he's certainly the greatest at the World Series of Poker.

29:14.300 --> 29:17.980
 And he is the greatest at, despite the game switching

29:17.980 --> 29:20.900
 into a pure game, almost an entire game of math,

29:20.900 --> 29:22.860
 he has managed to keep the magic alive.

29:22.860 --> 29:26.020
 And this like, just through sheer force of will,

29:26.020 --> 29:27.620
 making the game work for him.

29:27.620 --> 29:28.660
 And that is incredible.

29:28.660 --> 29:30.460
 And I think it's something that should be studied

29:30.460 --> 29:32.020
 because it's an example.

29:32.020 --> 29:35.260
 Yeah, there might be some actual game theoretic wisdom.

29:35.260 --> 29:37.420
 There might be something to be said about optimality

29:37.420 --> 29:39.220
 from studying him.

29:39.220 --> 29:40.940
 What do you mean by optimality?

29:40.940 --> 29:45.540
 Meaning, or rather game design, perhaps.

29:45.540 --> 29:48.460
 Meaning if what he's doing is working,

29:48.460 --> 29:51.620
 maybe poker is more complicated

29:51.620 --> 29:54.220
 than the one we're currently modeling it as.

29:54.220 --> 29:55.060
 So like his, yeah.

29:55.060 --> 29:56.660
 Or there's an extra layer,

29:56.660 --> 29:59.500
 and I don't mean to get too weird and wooey,

29:59.500 --> 30:04.700
 but, or there's an extra layer of ability

30:04.700 --> 30:07.580
 to manipulate the things the way you want them to go

30:07.580 --> 30:09.780
 that we don't understand yet.

30:09.780 --> 30:12.020
 Do you think Phil Hellmuth understands them?

30:12.020 --> 30:13.660
 Is he just generally?

30:13.660 --> 30:14.780
 Hashtag positivity.

30:14.780 --> 30:17.220
 Well, he wrote a book on positivity and he's.

30:17.220 --> 30:20.460
 He has, he did, not like a trolling book.

30:20.460 --> 30:21.300
 No.

30:21.300 --> 30:22.900
 He's just straight up, yeah.

30:23.980 --> 30:26.020
 Phil Hellmuth wrote a book about positivity.

30:26.020 --> 30:27.220
 Yes.

30:27.220 --> 30:28.620
 Okay, not ironic.

30:28.620 --> 30:31.820
 And I think it's about sort of manifesting what you want

30:32.700 --> 30:34.100
 and getting the outcomes that you want

30:34.100 --> 30:36.460
 by believing so much in yourself

30:36.460 --> 30:37.620
 and in your ability to win,

30:37.620 --> 30:38.980
 like eyes on the prize.

30:40.540 --> 30:42.140
 And I mean, it's working.

30:42.140 --> 30:43.180
 The man's delivered.

30:43.180 --> 30:45.340
 But where do you put like Phil Ivey

30:45.340 --> 30:47.300
 and all those kinds of people?

30:47.300 --> 30:49.700
 I mean, I'm too, I've been,

30:49.700 --> 30:50.900
 to be honest too much out of the scene

30:50.900 --> 30:52.620
 for the last few years to really,

30:53.740 --> 30:54.940
 I mean, Phil Ivey's clearly got,

30:54.940 --> 30:56.500
 again, he's got that X factor.

30:57.900 --> 31:00.340
 He's so incredibly intimidating to play against.

31:00.340 --> 31:01.700
 I've only played against him a couple of times,

31:01.700 --> 31:03.660
 but when he like looks you in the eye

31:03.660 --> 31:04.980
 and you're trying to run a bluff on him,

31:04.980 --> 31:07.100
 oof, no one's made me sweat harder than Phil Ivey,

31:07.100 --> 31:10.340
 just my bluff got through actually.

31:10.340 --> 31:11.780
 That was actually one of the most thrilling moments

31:11.780 --> 31:12.940
 I've ever had in poker was,

31:12.940 --> 31:15.460
 it was in a Monte Carlo in a high roller.

31:15.460 --> 31:16.700
 I can't remember exactly what the hand was,

31:16.700 --> 31:19.500
 but I, you know, a three bit

31:19.500 --> 31:22.100
 and then like just barreled all the way through.

31:22.100 --> 31:24.380
 And he just like put his laser eyes into me.

31:24.380 --> 31:28.180
 And I felt like he was just scouring my soul.

31:28.180 --> 31:29.780
 And I was just like, hold it together, Liv,

31:29.780 --> 31:30.620
 hold it together.

31:30.620 --> 31:31.460
 And he was like, folded.

31:31.460 --> 31:33.060
 And you knew your hand was weaker.

31:33.060 --> 31:34.420
 Yeah, I mean, I was bluffing.

31:34.420 --> 31:36.420
 I presume, which, you know,

31:36.420 --> 31:37.780
 there's a chance I was bluffing with the best hand,

31:37.780 --> 31:39.780
 but I'm pretty sure my hand was worse.

31:40.700 --> 31:43.300
 And he folded.

31:44.620 --> 31:47.500
 I was truly one of the deep highlights of my career.

31:47.500 --> 31:50.020
 Did you show the cards or did you fold?

31:50.020 --> 31:51.980
 You should never show in game.

31:51.980 --> 31:53.660
 Like, because especially as I felt like

31:53.660 --> 31:54.900
 I was one of the worst players at the table

31:54.900 --> 31:55.740
 in that tournament.

31:55.740 --> 31:57.900
 So giving that information,

31:57.900 --> 31:59.900
 unless I had a really solid plan

31:59.900 --> 32:01.980
 that I was now like advertising,

32:01.980 --> 32:03.580
 oh, look, I'm capable of bluffing Phil Ivey.

32:03.580 --> 32:05.140
 But like, why?

32:05.140 --> 32:07.620
 It's much more valuable to take advantage

32:07.620 --> 32:09.020
 of the impression that they have of me,

32:09.020 --> 32:10.220
 which is like, I'm a scared girl

32:10.220 --> 32:12.060
 playing a high roller for the first time.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.380
 Keep that going, you know.

32:14.740 --> 32:15.580
 Interesting.

32:15.580 --> 32:17.100
 But isn't there layers to this?

32:17.100 --> 32:18.780
 Like psychological warfare

32:18.780 --> 32:22.420
 that the scared girl might be way smart

32:22.420 --> 32:24.700
 and then like just to flip the tables?

32:24.700 --> 32:25.540
 Do you think about that kind of stuff?

32:25.540 --> 32:28.500
 Or is it better not to reveal information?

32:28.500 --> 32:29.500
 I mean, generally speaking,

32:29.500 --> 32:31.060
 you want to not reveal information.

32:31.060 --> 32:32.700
 You know, the goal of poker is to be

32:32.700 --> 32:36.020
 as deceptive as possible about your own strategies

32:36.020 --> 32:38.700
 while elucidating as much out of your opponent

32:38.700 --> 32:39.740
 about their own.

32:39.740 --> 32:42.100
 So giving them free information,

32:42.100 --> 32:42.940
 particularly if they're people

32:42.940 --> 32:44.820
 who you consider very good players,

32:44.820 --> 32:47.100
 any information I give them is going into

32:47.100 --> 32:49.220
 their little database and being,

32:49.220 --> 32:51.780
 I assume it's going to be calculated and used well.

32:51.780 --> 32:53.500
 So I have to be really confident

32:53.500 --> 32:56.700
 that my like meta gaming that I'm going to then do,

32:56.700 --> 32:58.340
 oh, they've seen this, so therefore that.

32:58.340 --> 33:00.660
 I'm going to be on the right level.

33:00.660 --> 33:03.380
 So it's better just to keep that little secret

33:03.380 --> 33:04.340
 to myself in the moment.

33:04.340 --> 33:06.700
 So how much is bluffing part of the game?

33:06.700 --> 33:08.340
 Huge amount.

33:08.340 --> 33:10.420
 So yeah, I mean, maybe actually let me ask,

33:10.420 --> 33:12.980
 like, what did it feel like with Phil Ivey

33:12.980 --> 33:15.020
 or anyone else when it's a high stake,

33:15.020 --> 33:18.860
 when it's a big, it's a big bluff?

33:18.860 --> 33:23.060
 So a lot of money on the table and maybe,

33:23.060 --> 33:24.660
 I mean, what defines a big bluff?

33:24.660 --> 33:25.980
 Maybe a lot of money on the table,

33:25.980 --> 33:29.180
 but also some uncertainty in your mind and heart

33:29.180 --> 33:31.940
 about like self doubt.

33:31.940 --> 33:34.540
 Well, maybe I miscalculated what's going on here,

33:34.540 --> 33:36.740
 what the bet said, all that kind of stuff.

33:36.740 --> 33:38.820
 Like, what does that feel like?

33:38.820 --> 33:43.820
 I mean, it's, I imagine comparable to,

33:45.980 --> 33:49.020
 you know, running a, I mean, any kind of big bluff

33:49.020 --> 33:52.380
 where you have a lot of something

33:52.380 --> 33:54.260
 that you care about on the line.

33:54.260 --> 33:57.220
 You know, so if you're bluffing in a courtroom,

33:57.220 --> 33:58.180
 not that anyone should ever do that,

33:58.180 --> 34:00.340
 or, you know, something equatable to that.

34:00.340 --> 34:04.100
 It's, you know, in that scenario, you know,

34:04.100 --> 34:05.700
 I think it was the first time I'd ever played a 20,

34:05.700 --> 34:09.180
 I'd won my way into this 25K tournament.

34:09.180 --> 34:11.180
 So that was the buy in 25,000 euros.

34:11.180 --> 34:13.020
 And I had satelliteed my way in

34:13.020 --> 34:14.020
 because it was much bigger

34:14.020 --> 34:16.060
 than I would ever normally play.

34:16.060 --> 34:18.260
 And, you know, I hadn't, I wasn't that experienced

34:18.260 --> 34:20.140
 at the time, and now I was sitting there

34:20.140 --> 34:21.620
 against all the big boys, you know,

34:21.620 --> 34:23.580
 the Negronus, the Phil Ivey's and so on.

34:24.740 --> 34:28.780
 And then to like, you know,

34:28.780 --> 34:30.580
 each time you put the bets out, you know,

34:30.580 --> 34:33.020
 you put another bet out, your card.

34:33.020 --> 34:34.860
 Yeah, I was on what's called a semi bluff.

34:34.860 --> 34:36.300
 So there were some cards that could come

34:36.300 --> 34:38.100
 that would make my hand very, very strong

34:38.100 --> 34:39.180
 and therefore win.

34:39.180 --> 34:40.940
 But most of the time, those cards don't come.

34:40.940 --> 34:43.860
 So that is a semi bluff because you're representing,

34:43.860 --> 34:46.980
 are you representing that you already have something?

34:47.860 --> 34:51.340
 So I think in this scenario, I had a flush draw.

34:51.340 --> 34:55.940
 So I had two clubs, two clubs came out on the flop.

34:55.940 --> 34:57.260
 And then I'm hoping that on the turn

34:57.260 --> 34:59.140
 and the river, one will come.

34:59.140 --> 35:00.980
 So I have some future equity.

35:00.980 --> 35:02.780
 I could hit a club and then I'll have the best hand

35:02.780 --> 35:04.620
 in which case, great.

35:04.620 --> 35:07.460
 And so I can keep betting and I'll want them to call,

35:07.460 --> 35:09.660
 but I'm also got the other way of winning the hand

35:09.660 --> 35:11.940
 where if my card doesn't come,

35:11.940 --> 35:14.740
 I can keep betting and get them to fold their hand.

35:14.740 --> 35:18.020
 And I'm pretty sure that's what the scenario was.

35:18.020 --> 35:21.020
 So I had some future equity, but it's still, you know,

35:21.020 --> 35:23.300
 most of the time I don't hit that club.

35:23.300 --> 35:25.940
 And so I would rather him just fold because I'm, you know,

35:25.940 --> 35:27.820
 the pot is now getting bigger and bigger.

35:27.820 --> 35:30.980
 And in the end, like I've jam all in on the river.

35:30.980 --> 35:33.420
 That's my entire tournament on the line.

35:33.420 --> 35:35.180
 As far as I'm aware, this might be the one time

35:35.180 --> 35:37.220
 I ever get to play a big 25K.

35:37.220 --> 35:38.700
 You know, this was the first time I played one.

35:38.700 --> 35:42.020
 So it was, it felt like the most momentous thing.

35:42.020 --> 35:43.900
 And this was also when I was trying to build myself up at,

35:43.900 --> 35:46.700
 you know, build my name, a name for myself in poker.

35:46.700 --> 35:47.740
 I wanted to get respect.

35:47.740 --> 35:49.260
 Destroy everything for you.

35:49.260 --> 35:50.540
 It felt like it in the moment.

35:50.540 --> 35:51.780
 Like, I mean, it literally does feel

35:51.780 --> 35:52.820
 like a form of life and death.

35:52.820 --> 35:54.340
 Like your body physiologically

35:54.340 --> 35:56.140
 is having that flight or fight response.

35:56.140 --> 35:57.140
 What are you doing with your body?

35:57.140 --> 35:58.340
 What are you doing with your face?

35:58.340 --> 36:01.340
 Are you just like, what are you thinking about?

36:01.340 --> 36:04.700
 More of a mixture of like, okay, what are the cards?

36:04.700 --> 36:07.020
 So in theory, I'm thinking about like, okay,

36:07.020 --> 36:09.980
 what are cards that make my hand look stronger?

36:09.980 --> 36:13.860
 Which cards hit my perceived range from his perspective?

36:13.860 --> 36:15.620
 Which cards don't?

36:15.620 --> 36:17.340
 What's the right amount of bet size

36:17.340 --> 36:20.820
 to maximize my fold equity in this situation?

36:20.820 --> 36:22.100
 You know, that's the logical stuff

36:22.100 --> 36:23.180
 that I should be thinking about.

36:23.180 --> 36:25.380
 But I think in reality, because I was so scared,

36:25.380 --> 36:26.860
 because there's this, at least for me,

36:26.860 --> 36:30.420
 there's a certain threshold of like nervousness or stress

36:30.420 --> 36:33.420
 beyond which the logical brain shuts off.

36:33.420 --> 36:35.220
 And now it just gets into this like,

36:36.900 --> 36:38.740
 just like, it feels like a game of wits, basically.

36:38.740 --> 36:39.780
 It's like of nerve.

36:39.780 --> 36:41.780
 Can you hold your resolve?

36:41.780 --> 36:44.300
 And it certainly got by that, like by the river.

36:44.300 --> 36:45.780
 I think by that point, I was like,

36:45.780 --> 36:47.660
 I don't even know if this is a good bluff anymore,

36:47.660 --> 36:50.060
 but fuck it, let's do it.

36:50.060 --> 36:53.100
 Your mind is almost numb from the intensity of that feeling.

36:53.100 --> 36:55.100
 I call it the white noise.

36:55.100 --> 36:58.860
 And it happens in all kinds of decision making.

36:58.860 --> 37:00.740
 I think anything that's really, really stressful.

37:00.740 --> 37:02.940
 I can imagine someone in like an important job interview,

37:02.940 --> 37:04.780
 if it's like a job they've always wanted,

37:04.780 --> 37:06.540
 and they're getting grilled, you know,

37:06.540 --> 37:09.180
 like Bridgewater style, where they ask these really hard,

37:09.180 --> 37:11.140
 like mathematical questions.

37:11.140 --> 37:13.420
 You know, it's a really learned skill

37:13.420 --> 37:17.780
 to be able to like subdue your flight or fight response.

37:17.780 --> 37:19.380
 You know, I think get from the sympathetic

37:19.380 --> 37:20.340
 into the parasympathetic.

37:20.340 --> 37:23.820
 So you can actually, you know, engage that voice

37:23.820 --> 37:26.020
 in your head and do those slow logical calculations.

37:26.020 --> 37:29.020
 Because evolutionarily, you know, if we see a lion

37:29.020 --> 37:31.660
 running at us, we didn't have time to sort of calculate

37:31.660 --> 37:33.980
 the lion's kinetic energy and, you know,

37:33.980 --> 37:35.420
 is it optimal to go this way or that way?

37:35.420 --> 37:37.060
 You just react it.

37:37.060 --> 37:39.860
 And physically, our bodies are well attuned

37:39.860 --> 37:41.140
 to actually make right decisions.

37:41.140 --> 37:43.220
 But when you're playing a game like poker,

37:43.220 --> 37:44.780
 this is not something that you ever, you know,

37:44.780 --> 37:45.940
 evolved to do.

37:45.940 --> 37:48.980
 And yet you're in that same flight or fight response.

37:48.980 --> 37:51.740
 And so that's a really important skill to be able to develop

37:51.740 --> 37:54.900
 to basically learn how to like meditate in the moment

37:54.900 --> 37:57.420
 and calm yourself so that you can think clearly.

37:57.420 --> 38:00.780
 But as you were searching for a comparable thing,

38:00.780 --> 38:03.300
 it's interesting because you just made me realize

38:03.300 --> 38:06.580
 that bluffing is like an incredibly high stakes

38:06.580 --> 38:08.180
 form of lying.

38:08.180 --> 38:09.660
 You're lying.

38:10.780 --> 38:11.620
 And I don't think you can.

38:11.620 --> 38:12.460
 Telling a story.

38:12.460 --> 38:15.180
 No, no, it's straight up lying.

38:15.180 --> 38:19.060
 In the context of game, it's not a negative kind of lying.

38:19.060 --> 38:19.900
 But it is, yeah, exactly.

38:19.900 --> 38:23.340
 You're representing something that you don't have.

38:23.340 --> 38:26.740
 And I was thinking like how often in life

38:26.740 --> 38:30.300
 do we have such high stakes of lying?

38:30.300 --> 38:33.420
 Because I was thinking certainly

38:33.420 --> 38:36.060
 in high level military strategy,

38:36.060 --> 38:40.220
 I was thinking when Hitler was lying to Stalin

38:40.220 --> 38:44.540
 about his plans to invade the Soviet Union.

38:44.540 --> 38:48.300
 And so you're talking to a person like your friends

38:48.300 --> 38:50.700
 and you're fighting against the enemy,

38:50.700 --> 38:53.900
 whatever the formulation of the enemy is.

38:53.900 --> 38:56.780
 But meanwhile, whole time you're building up troops

38:56.780 --> 38:57.620
 on the border.

38:58.900 --> 38:59.740
 That's extremely.

38:59.740 --> 39:01.420
 Wait, wait, so Hitler and Stalin were like

39:01.420 --> 39:02.460
 pretending to be friends?

39:02.460 --> 39:03.300
 Yeah.

39:03.300 --> 39:04.140
 Well, my history knowledge is terrible.

39:04.140 --> 39:04.980
 Oh yeah.

39:04.980 --> 39:05.820
 That's crazy.

39:05.820 --> 39:09.500
 Yeah, that they were, oh man.

39:09.500 --> 39:11.460
 And it worked because Stalin,

39:11.460 --> 39:14.260
 until the troops crossed the border

39:14.260 --> 39:17.500
 and invaded in Operation Barbarossa

39:17.500 --> 39:22.500
 where this storm of Nazi troops

39:22.780 --> 39:25.100
 invaded large parts of the Soviet Union.

39:25.100 --> 39:30.100
 And hence, one of the biggest wars in human history began.

39:30.380 --> 39:34.900
 Stalin for sure thought that this was never going to be,

39:34.900 --> 39:38.660
 that Hitler is not crazy enough to invade the Soviet Union.

39:38.660 --> 39:41.780
 And it makes, geopolitically makes total sense

39:41.780 --> 39:43.020
 to be collaborators.

39:43.020 --> 39:46.260
 And ideologically, even though there's a tension

39:46.260 --> 39:50.300
 between communism and fascism or national socialism,

39:50.300 --> 39:51.500
 however you formulate it,

39:51.500 --> 39:54.340
 it still feels like this is the right way

39:54.340 --> 39:55.780
 to battle the West.

39:55.780 --> 39:56.620
 Right.

39:56.620 --> 39:58.660
 They were more ideologically aligned.

39:58.660 --> 40:01.380
 They in theory had a common enemy, which is the West.

40:01.380 --> 40:03.460
 So it made total sense.

40:03.460 --> 40:05.420
 And in terms of negotiations

40:05.420 --> 40:07.300
 and the way things were communicated,

40:07.300 --> 40:11.540
 it seemed to Stalin that for sure,

40:11.540 --> 40:16.100
 that they would remain, at least for a while,

40:16.100 --> 40:17.620
 peaceful collaborators.

40:17.620 --> 40:21.380
 And that, and everybody, because of that,

40:21.380 --> 40:24.140
 in the Soviet Union believed that it was a huge shock

40:24.140 --> 40:25.820
 when Kiev was invaded.

40:25.820 --> 40:28.220
 And you hear echoes of that when I travel to Ukraine,

40:28.220 --> 40:32.180
 sort of the shock of the invasion.

40:32.180 --> 40:34.500
 It's not just the invasion on one particular border,

40:34.500 --> 40:36.700
 but the invasion of the capital city.

40:36.700 --> 40:41.380
 And just like, holy shit, especially at that time,

40:41.380 --> 40:44.220
 when you thought World War I,

40:44.220 --> 40:46.900
 you realized that that was the war to end all wars.

40:46.900 --> 40:48.980
 You would never have this kind of war.

40:48.980 --> 40:52.380
 And holy shit, this person is mad enough

40:52.380 --> 40:56.300
 to try to take on this monster in the Soviet Union.

40:56.300 --> 40:58.300
 So it's no longer going to be a war

40:58.300 --> 40:59.820
 of hundreds of thousands dead.

40:59.820 --> 41:02.260
 It'll be a war of tens of millions dead.

41:02.260 --> 41:07.260
 And yeah, but that, that's a very large scale kind of lie,

41:08.260 --> 41:11.460
 but I'm sure there's in politics and geopolitics,

41:11.460 --> 41:14.620
 that kind of lying happening all the time.

41:14.620 --> 41:17.260
 And a lot of people pay financially

41:17.260 --> 41:19.060
 and with their lives for that kind of lying.

41:19.060 --> 41:22.260
 But in our personal lives, I don't know how often we,

41:22.260 --> 41:23.100
 maybe we.

41:23.100 --> 41:23.940
 I think people do.

41:23.940 --> 41:25.900
 I mean, like think of spouses

41:25.900 --> 41:27.340
 cheating on their partners, right?

41:27.340 --> 41:28.340
 And then like having to lie,

41:28.340 --> 41:29.540
 like where were you last night?

41:29.540 --> 41:30.580
 Stuff like that. Oh shit, that's tough.

41:30.580 --> 41:31.420
 Yeah, that's true.

41:31.420 --> 41:34.220
 Like that's, I think, you know, I mean,

41:34.220 --> 41:36.180
 unfortunately that stuff happens all the time, right?

41:36.180 --> 41:38.740
 Or having like multiple families, that one is great.

41:38.740 --> 41:42.220
 When each family doesn't know about the other one

41:42.220 --> 41:44.620
 and like maintaining that life.

41:44.620 --> 41:47.260
 There's probably a sense of excitement about that too.

41:48.580 --> 41:50.700
 Or. It seems unnecessary, yeah.

41:50.700 --> 41:51.740
 But. Why?

41:51.740 --> 41:52.580
 Well, just lying.

41:52.580 --> 41:56.300
 Like, you know, the truth finds a way of coming out.

41:56.300 --> 41:57.140
 You know? Yes.

41:57.140 --> 41:59.220
 But hence that's the thrill.

41:59.220 --> 42:00.220
 Yeah, perhaps.

42:00.220 --> 42:01.060
 Yeah, people.

42:01.060 --> 42:04.220
 I mean, you know, that's why I think actually like poker.

42:04.220 --> 42:05.940
 What's so interesting about poker

42:05.940 --> 42:09.860
 is most of the best players I know,

42:09.860 --> 42:10.900
 they're always exceptions, you know?

42:10.900 --> 42:12.460
 They're always bad eggs.

42:12.460 --> 42:15.140
 But actually poker players are very honest people.

42:15.140 --> 42:17.540
 I would say they are more honest than the average,

42:17.540 --> 42:22.380
 you know, if you just took random population sample.

42:22.380 --> 42:26.100
 Because A, you know, I think, you know,

42:26.100 --> 42:27.580
 humans like to have that.

42:28.500 --> 42:30.580
 Most people like to have some kind of, you know,

42:30.580 --> 42:32.740
 mysterious, you know, an opportunity to do something

42:32.740 --> 42:34.900
 like a little edgy.

42:34.900 --> 42:36.860
 So we get to sort of scratch that itch

42:36.860 --> 42:38.340
 of being edgy at the poker table,

42:38.340 --> 42:40.420
 where it's like, it's part of the game.

42:40.420 --> 42:43.420
 Everyone knows what they're in for, and that's allowed.

42:43.420 --> 42:46.260
 And you get to like really get that out of your system.

42:47.740 --> 42:51.220
 And then also like poker players learned that, you know,

42:51.220 --> 42:55.380
 I would play in a huge game against some of my friends,

42:55.380 --> 42:57.740
 even my partner, Igor, where we will be, you know,

42:57.740 --> 42:59.660
 absolutely going at each other's throats,

42:59.660 --> 43:02.060
 trying to draw blood in terms of winning each money

43:02.060 --> 43:04.020
 off each other and like getting under each other's skin,

43:04.020 --> 43:08.340
 winding each other up, doing the craftiest moves we can.

43:08.340 --> 43:11.100
 But then once the game's done, you know,

43:11.100 --> 43:12.260
 the winners and the losers will go off

43:12.260 --> 43:13.860
 and get a drink together and have a fun time

43:13.860 --> 43:16.660
 and like talk about it in this like weird academic way

43:16.660 --> 43:19.500
 afterwards, because, and that's why games are so great.

43:19.500 --> 43:23.980
 Cause you get to like live out like this competitive urge

43:23.980 --> 43:26.420
 that, you know, most people have.

43:26.420 --> 43:28.660
 What's it feel like to lose?

43:28.660 --> 43:31.380
 Like we talked about bluffing when it worked out.

43:31.380 --> 43:34.540
 What about when you, when you go broke?

43:35.380 --> 43:39.140
 So like in a game, I'm, fortunately I've never gone broke.

43:39.140 --> 43:40.820
 You mean like full life?

43:40.820 --> 43:42.460
 Full life, no.

43:42.460 --> 43:44.060
 I know plenty of people who have.

43:46.740 --> 43:48.180
 And I don't think Igor would mind me saying he went,

43:48.180 --> 43:50.300
 you know, he went broke once in poker bowl, you know,

43:50.300 --> 43:51.820
 early on when we were together.

43:51.820 --> 43:54.260
 I feel like you haven't lived unless you've gone broke.

43:54.260 --> 43:55.660
 Oh yeah.

43:55.660 --> 43:56.500
 Some sense.

43:56.500 --> 43:57.340
 Right.

43:57.340 --> 43:58.180
 Some fundamental sense.

43:58.180 --> 43:59.900
 I mean, I'm happy, I've sort of lived through it,

43:59.900 --> 44:02.420
 vicariously through him when he did it at the time.

44:02.420 --> 44:04.140
 But yeah, what's it like to lose?

44:04.140 --> 44:04.980
 Well, it depends.

44:04.980 --> 44:06.020
 So it depends on the amount.

44:06.020 --> 44:07.660
 It depends what percentage of your net worth

44:07.660 --> 44:08.580
 you've just lost.

44:10.060 --> 44:11.540
 It depends on your brain chemistry.

44:11.540 --> 44:13.140
 It really, you know, varies from person to person.

44:13.140 --> 44:16.900
 You have a very cold calculating way of thinking about this.

44:16.900 --> 44:18.980
 So it depends what percentage.

44:18.980 --> 44:20.700
 Well, it did, it really does, right?

44:20.700 --> 44:22.140
 Yeah, it's true, it's true.

44:22.140 --> 44:24.740
 I mean, that's another thing poker trains you to do.

44:24.740 --> 44:28.060
 You see, you see everything in percentages

44:28.060 --> 44:30.820
 or you see everything in like ROI or expected hourlies

44:30.820 --> 44:32.420
 or cost benefit, et cetera.

44:32.420 --> 44:37.220
 You know, so that's, one of the things I've tried to do

44:37.220 --> 44:39.820
 is calibrate the strength of my emotional response

44:39.820 --> 44:43.380
 to the win or loss that I've received.

44:43.380 --> 44:45.540
 Because it's no good if you like, you know,

44:45.540 --> 44:49.340
 you have a huge emotional dramatic response to a tiny loss

44:50.460 --> 44:53.220
 or on the flip side, you have a huge win

44:53.220 --> 44:54.580
 and you're sort of so dead inside

44:54.580 --> 44:55.420
 that you don't even feel it.

44:55.420 --> 44:56.820
 Well, that's, you know, that's a shame.

44:56.820 --> 45:00.220
 I want my emotions to calibrate with reality

45:00.220 --> 45:01.420
 as much as possible.

45:02.860 --> 45:04.180
 So yeah, what's it like to lose?

45:04.180 --> 45:07.180
 I mean, I've had times where I've lost, you know,

45:07.180 --> 45:09.260
 busted out of a tournament that I thought I was gonna win in

45:09.260 --> 45:13.060
 especially if I got really unlucky or I make a dumb play

45:13.940 --> 45:17.540
 where I've gone away and like, you know, kicked the wall,

45:17.540 --> 45:19.900
 punched a wall, I like nearly broke my hand one time.

45:19.900 --> 45:24.100
 Like I'm a lot less competitive than I used to be.

45:24.100 --> 45:27.540
 Like I was like pathologically competitive in my like

45:27.540 --> 45:30.900
 late teens, early twenties, I just had to win at everything.

45:30.900 --> 45:33.540
 And I think that sort of slowly waned as I've gotten older.

45:33.540 --> 45:34.860
 According to you, yeah.

45:34.860 --> 45:35.700
 According to me.

45:35.700 --> 45:38.500
 I don't know if others would say the same, right?

45:38.500 --> 45:40.860
 I feel like ultra competitive people,

45:40.860 --> 45:43.020
 like I've heard Joe Rogan say this to me.

45:43.020 --> 45:44.780
 It's like that he's a lot less competitive

45:44.780 --> 45:45.620
 than he used to be.

45:45.620 --> 45:47.380
 I don't know about that.

45:47.380 --> 45:48.420
 Oh, I believe it.

45:48.420 --> 45:49.260
 No, I totally believe it.

45:49.260 --> 45:51.460
 Like, because as you get, you can still be,

45:51.460 --> 45:53.020
 like I care about winning.

45:53.020 --> 45:56.060
 Like when, you know, I play a game with my buddies online

45:56.060 --> 45:57.460
 or, you know, whatever it is,

45:57.460 --> 45:58.780
 polytopia is my current obsession.

45:58.780 --> 46:00.820
 Like when I.

46:00.820 --> 46:02.980
 Thank you for passing on your obsession to me.

46:02.980 --> 46:03.820
 Are you playing now?

46:03.820 --> 46:04.780
 Yeah, I'm playing now.

46:04.780 --> 46:05.900
 We gotta have a game.

46:05.900 --> 46:08.140
 But I'm terrible and I enjoy playing terribly.

46:08.140 --> 46:10.060
 I don't wanna have a game because that's gonna pull me

46:10.060 --> 46:13.940
 into your monster of like a competitive play.

46:13.940 --> 46:15.420
 It's important, it's an important skill.

46:15.420 --> 46:18.340
 I'm enjoying playing on the, I can't.

46:18.340 --> 46:20.980
 You just do the points thing, you know, against the bots.

46:20.980 --> 46:22.020
 Yeah, against the bots.

46:22.020 --> 46:26.100
 And I can't even do the, there's like a hard one

46:26.100 --> 46:26.940
 and there's a very hard one.

46:26.940 --> 46:27.820
 And then it's crazy, yeah.

46:27.820 --> 46:28.660
 It's crazy.

46:28.660 --> 46:29.900
 I can't, I don't even enjoy the hard one.

46:29.900 --> 46:32.020
 The crazy, I really don't enjoy.

46:32.020 --> 46:33.660
 Cause it's intense.

46:33.660 --> 46:34.980
 You have to constantly try to win

46:34.980 --> 46:37.980
 as opposed to enjoy building a little world and.

46:37.980 --> 46:38.820
 Yeah, no, no, no.

46:38.820 --> 46:40.100
 There's no time for exploration in polytopia.

46:40.100 --> 46:40.940
 You gotta get.

46:40.940 --> 46:42.740
 Well, when, once you graduate from the crazies,

46:42.740 --> 46:44.540
 then you can come play the.

46:44.540 --> 46:46.460
 Graduate from the crazies.

46:46.460 --> 46:48.620
 Yeah, so in order to be able to play a decent game

46:48.620 --> 46:51.700
 against like, you know, our group,

46:51.700 --> 46:55.740
 you'll need to be, you'll need to be consistently winning

46:55.740 --> 46:58.300
 like 90% of games against 15 crazy bots.

46:58.300 --> 46:59.180
 Yeah.

46:59.180 --> 47:00.740
 And you'll be able to, like there'll be,

47:00.740 --> 47:03.340
 I could teach you it within a day, honestly.

47:03.340 --> 47:04.660
 How to beat the crazies?

47:04.660 --> 47:05.740
 How to beat the crazies.

47:05.740 --> 47:08.140
 And then, and then you'll be ready for the big leagues.

47:08.140 --> 47:11.060
 Generalizes to more than just polytopia.

47:11.060 --> 47:14.420
 But okay, why were we talking about polytopia?

47:14.420 --> 47:15.980
 Losing hurts.

47:15.980 --> 47:17.060
 Losing hurts, oh yeah.

47:17.060 --> 47:19.380
 Yes, competitiveness over time.

47:19.380 --> 47:20.340
 Oh yeah.

47:20.340 --> 47:23.340
 I think it's more that, at least for me,

47:23.340 --> 47:24.740
 I still care about playing,

47:24.740 --> 47:26.460
 about winning when I choose to play something.

47:26.460 --> 47:28.700
 It's just that I don't see the world

47:28.700 --> 47:31.860
 as zero sum as I used to be, you know?

47:31.860 --> 47:34.940
 I think as one gets older and wiser,

47:34.940 --> 47:38.060
 you start to see the world more as a positive something.

47:38.060 --> 47:40.820
 Or at least you're more aware of externalities,

47:40.820 --> 47:43.740
 of scenarios, of competitive interactions.

47:43.740 --> 47:47.180
 And so, yeah, I just like, I'm more,

47:47.180 --> 47:50.180
 and I'm more aware of my own, you know, like,

47:50.180 --> 47:52.780
 if I have a really strong emotional response to losing,

47:52.780 --> 47:54.980
 and that makes me then feel shitty for the rest of the day,

47:54.980 --> 47:57.220
 and then I beat myself up mentally for it.

47:57.220 --> 47:58.660
 Like, I'm now more aware

47:58.660 --> 48:01.660
 that that's unnecessary negative externality.

48:01.660 --> 48:03.940
 So I'm like, okay, I need to find a way to turn this down,

48:03.940 --> 48:05.300
 you know, dial this down a bit.

48:05.300 --> 48:07.580
 Was poker the thing that has,

48:07.580 --> 48:09.700
 if you think back at your life,

48:09.700 --> 48:12.180
 and think about some of the lower points of your life,

48:12.180 --> 48:15.020
 like the darker places you've got in your mind,

48:15.020 --> 48:17.140
 did it have to do something with poker?

48:17.140 --> 48:22.140
 Like, did losing spark the descent into darkness,

48:23.620 --> 48:24.940
 or was it something else?

48:27.540 --> 48:29.460
 I think my darkest points in poker

48:29.460 --> 48:34.460
 were when I was wanting to quit and move on to other things,

48:34.500 --> 48:38.340
 but I felt like I hadn't ticked all the boxes

48:38.340 --> 48:39.980
 I wanted to tick.

48:39.980 --> 48:43.740
 Like, I wanted to be the most winningest female player,

48:43.740 --> 48:45.540
 which is by itself a bad goal.

48:45.540 --> 48:47.940
 You know, that was one of my initial goals,

48:47.940 --> 48:48.900
 and I was like, well, I haven't, you know,

48:48.900 --> 48:50.900
 and I wanted to win a WPT event.

48:50.900 --> 48:52.100
 I've won one of these, I've won one of these,

48:52.100 --> 48:53.540
 but I want one of those as well.

48:53.540 --> 48:57.380
 And that sort of, again, like,

48:57.380 --> 49:00.060
 it's a drive of like overoptimization to random metrics

49:00.060 --> 49:01.540
 that I decided were important

49:02.420 --> 49:05.220
 without much wisdom at the time, but then like carried on.

49:06.540 --> 49:09.540
 That made me continue chasing it longer

49:09.540 --> 49:12.860
 than I still actually had the passion to chase it for.

49:12.860 --> 49:15.740
 And I don't have any regrets that, you know,

49:15.740 --> 49:17.540
 I played for as long as I did, because who knows,

49:17.540 --> 49:19.260
 you know, I wouldn't be sitting here,

49:19.260 --> 49:21.020
 I wouldn't be living this incredible life

49:21.020 --> 49:22.660
 that I'm living now.

49:22.660 --> 49:24.860
 This is the height of your life right now.

49:24.860 --> 49:28.100
 This is it, peak experience, absolute pinnacle

49:28.100 --> 49:33.100
 here in your robot land with your creepy light.

49:34.500 --> 49:37.340
 No, it is, I mean, I wouldn't change a thing

49:37.340 --> 49:40.900
 about my life right now, and I feel very blessed to say that.

49:40.900 --> 49:45.900
 So, but the dark times were in the sort of like 2016 to 18,

49:47.980 --> 49:50.340
 even sooner really, where I was like,

49:50.340 --> 49:53.100
 I had stopped loving the game,

49:53.100 --> 49:55.420
 and I was going through the motions,

49:55.420 --> 49:59.660
 and I would, and then I was like, you know,

49:59.660 --> 50:02.220
 I would take the losses harder than I needed to,

50:02.220 --> 50:03.380
 because I'm like, ah, it's another one.

50:03.380 --> 50:04.820
 And it was, I was aware that like,

50:04.820 --> 50:06.180
 I felt like my life was ticking away,

50:06.180 --> 50:07.940
 and I was like, is this gonna be what's on my tombstone?

50:07.940 --> 50:09.580
 Oh yeah, she played the game of, you know,

50:09.580 --> 50:11.700
 this zero sum game of poker,

50:11.700 --> 50:14.100
 slightly more optimally than her next opponent.

50:14.100 --> 50:16.380
 Like, cool, great, legacy, you know?

50:16.380 --> 50:19.660
 So, I just wanted, you know, there was something in me

50:19.660 --> 50:21.340
 that knew I needed to be doing something

50:21.340 --> 50:25.260
 more directly impactful and just meaningful.

50:25.260 --> 50:26.260
 It was just like your search for meaning,

50:26.260 --> 50:27.940
 and I think it's a thing a lot of poker players,

50:27.940 --> 50:30.900
 even a lot of, I imagine any games players

50:30.900 --> 50:34.500
 who sort of love intellectual pursuits,

50:36.100 --> 50:37.660
 you know, I think you should ask Magnus Carlsen

50:37.660 --> 50:38.500
 this question, I don't know what he's on.

50:38.500 --> 50:39.780
 He's walking away from chess, right?

50:39.780 --> 50:41.500
 Yeah, like, it must be so hard for him.

50:41.500 --> 50:43.740
 You know, he's been on the top for so long,

50:43.740 --> 50:45.300
 and it's like, well, now what?

50:45.300 --> 50:48.700
 He's got this incredible brain, like, what to put it to?

50:49.980 --> 50:52.100
 And, yeah, it's.

50:52.100 --> 50:55.620
 It's this weird moment where I've just spoken with people

50:55.620 --> 50:58.380
 that won multiple gold medals at the Olympics,

50:58.380 --> 51:01.540
 and the depression hits hard after you win.

51:02.860 --> 51:04.180
 Dopamine crash.

51:04.180 --> 51:05.620
 Because it's a kind of a goodbye,

51:05.620 --> 51:06.900
 saying goodbye to that person,

51:06.900 --> 51:09.420
 to all the dreams you had that thought,

51:09.420 --> 51:11.860
 you thought would give meaning to your life,

51:11.860 --> 51:16.820
 but in fact, life is full of constant pursuits of meaning.

51:16.820 --> 51:20.260
 It doesn't, you don't like arrive and figure it all out,

51:20.260 --> 51:21.700
 and there's endless bliss,

51:21.700 --> 51:23.980
 and it continues going on and on.

51:23.980 --> 51:27.860
 You constantly have to figure out to rediscover yourself.

51:27.860 --> 51:31.580
 And so for you, like that struggle to say goodbye to poker,

51:31.580 --> 51:33.780
 you have to like find the next.

51:33.780 --> 51:34.940
 There's always a bigger game.

51:34.940 --> 51:35.780
 That's the thing.

51:35.780 --> 51:38.460
 That's my motto is like, what's the next game?

51:38.460 --> 51:41.220
 And more importantly,

51:41.220 --> 51:43.140
 because obviously game usually implies zero sum,

51:43.140 --> 51:46.580
 like what's a game which is like Omni win?

51:46.580 --> 51:47.700
 Like what? Omni win.

51:47.700 --> 51:48.540
 Omni win.

51:48.540 --> 51:50.740
 Why is Omni win so important?

51:50.740 --> 51:54.700
 Because if everyone plays zero sum games,

51:54.700 --> 51:57.180
 that's a fast track to either completely stagnate

51:57.180 --> 51:59.220
 as a civilization, but more actually,

51:59.220 --> 52:01.340
 far more likely to extinct ourselves.

52:02.300 --> 52:05.020
 You know, like the playing field is finite.

52:05.020 --> 52:09.620
 You know, nuclear powers are playing,

52:09.620 --> 52:12.020
 you know, a game of poker with, you know,

52:12.020 --> 52:14.500
 but their chips are nuclear weapons, right?

52:14.500 --> 52:17.020
 And the stakes have gotten so large

52:17.020 --> 52:19.140
 that if anyone makes a single bet, you know,

52:19.140 --> 52:22.100
 fires some weapons, the playing field breaks.

52:22.100 --> 52:22.940
 I made a video on this.

52:22.940 --> 52:26.900
 Like, you know, the playing field is finite.

52:26.900 --> 52:31.540
 And if we keep playing these adversarial zero sum games,

52:31.540 --> 52:33.180
 thinking that we, you know,

52:33.180 --> 52:35.420
 in order for us to win, someone else has to lose,

52:35.420 --> 52:37.740
 or if we lose that, you know, someone else wins,

52:37.740 --> 52:40.020
 that will extinct us.

52:40.020 --> 52:41.100
 It's just a matter of when.

52:41.100 --> 52:44.860
 What do you think about that mutually assured destruction,

52:44.860 --> 52:46.340
 that very simple,

52:46.340 --> 52:49.980
 almost to the point of caricaturing game theory idea

52:49.980 --> 52:52.340
 that does seem to be at the core

52:52.340 --> 52:54.060
 of why we haven't blown each other up yet

52:54.060 --> 52:55.660
 with nuclear weapons.

52:55.660 --> 52:57.540
 Do you think there's some truth to that,

52:57.540 --> 53:00.180
 this kind of stabilizing force

53:00.180 --> 53:01.500
 of mutually assured destruction?

53:01.500 --> 53:04.940
 And do you think that's gonna hold up

53:04.940 --> 53:07.340
 through the 21st century?

53:07.340 --> 53:09.980
 I mean, it has held.

53:09.980 --> 53:11.700
 Yes, there's definitely truth to it,

53:11.700 --> 53:14.740
 that it was a, you know, it's a Nash equilibrium.

53:14.740 --> 53:17.300
 Yeah, are you surprised it held this long?

53:17.300 --> 53:18.460
 Isn't it crazy?

53:18.460 --> 53:21.140
 It is crazy when you factor in all the like

53:21.140 --> 53:24.620
 near miss accidental firings.

53:24.620 --> 53:28.060
 Yes, that's makes me wonder like, you know,

53:28.060 --> 53:29.900
 are you familiar with the like quantum suicide

53:29.900 --> 53:33.020
 thought experiment, where it's basically like,

53:33.020 --> 53:36.580
 you have a, you know, like a Russian roulette

53:36.580 --> 53:40.620
 type scenario hooked up to some kind of quantum event,

53:40.620 --> 53:45.620
 you know, particle splitting or pair of particles splitting.

53:45.820 --> 53:48.420
 And if it, you know, if it goes A,

53:48.420 --> 53:50.260
 then the gun doesn't go off and it goes B,

53:50.260 --> 53:52.500
 then it does go off and it kills you.

53:52.500 --> 53:55.020
 Because you can only ever be in the universe,

53:55.020 --> 53:56.540
 you know, assuming like the Everett branch,

53:56.540 --> 53:57.780
 you know, multiverse theory,

53:57.780 --> 54:00.220
 you'll always only end up in the branch

54:00.220 --> 54:03.340
 where you continually make, you know, option A comes in,

54:03.340 --> 54:05.460
 but you run that experiment enough times,

54:05.460 --> 54:07.060
 it starts getting pretty damn, you know,

54:07.060 --> 54:09.380
 out of the tree gets huge,

54:09.380 --> 54:10.900
 there's a million different scenarios,

54:10.900 --> 54:12.420
 but you'll always find yourself in this,

54:12.420 --> 54:14.860
 in the one where it didn't go off.

54:14.860 --> 54:19.860
 And so from that perspective, you are essentially immortal

54:20.780 --> 54:22.580
 because someone, and you will only find yourself

54:22.580 --> 54:25.100
 in the set of observers that make it down that path.

54:25.100 --> 54:26.620
 So it's kind of a...

54:26.620 --> 54:30.420
 That doesn't mean, that doesn't mean

54:30.420 --> 54:33.140
 you're still not gonna be fucked at some point in your life.

54:33.140 --> 54:34.860
 No, of course not, no, I'm not advocating

54:34.860 --> 54:36.420
 like that we're all immortal because of this.

54:36.420 --> 54:38.460
 It's just like a fun thought experiment.

54:38.460 --> 54:40.100
 And the point is it like raises this thing

54:40.100 --> 54:42.380
 of like these things called observer selection effects,

54:42.380 --> 54:44.420
 which Bostrom, Nick Bostrom talks about a lot,

54:44.420 --> 54:46.180
 and I think people should go read.

54:46.180 --> 54:47.020
 It's really powerful,

54:47.020 --> 54:48.860
 but I think it could be overextended, that logic.

54:48.860 --> 54:52.220
 I'm not sure exactly how it can be.

54:52.220 --> 54:57.220
 I just feel like you can get, you can overgeneralize

54:57.300 --> 54:58.340
 that logic somehow.

54:58.340 --> 55:00.660
 Well, no, I mean, it leaves you into like solipsism,

55:00.660 --> 55:02.140
 which is a very dangerous mindset.

55:02.140 --> 55:04.340
 Again, if everyone like falls into solipsism of like,

55:04.340 --> 55:05.740
 well, I'll be fine.

55:05.740 --> 55:08.820
 That's a great way of creating a very,

55:08.820 --> 55:10.860
 self terminating environment.

55:10.860 --> 55:14.540
 But my point is, is that with the nuclear weapons thing,

55:14.540 --> 55:19.540
 there have been at least, I think it's 12 or 11 near misses

55:19.540 --> 55:22.940
 of like just stupid things, like there was moonrise

55:22.940 --> 55:25.860
 over Norway, and it made weird reflections

55:25.860 --> 55:28.820
 of some glaciers in the mountains, which set off,

55:28.820 --> 55:33.820
 I think the alarms of NORAD radar,

55:33.820 --> 55:35.700
 and that put them on high alert, nearly ready to shoot.

55:35.700 --> 55:39.540
 And it was only because the head of Russian military

55:39.540 --> 55:41.980
 happened to be at the UN in New York at the time

55:41.980 --> 55:43.300
 that they go like, well, wait a second,

55:43.300 --> 55:47.140
 why would they fire now when their guy is there?

55:47.140 --> 55:49.260
 And it was only that lucky happenstance,

55:49.260 --> 55:50.900
 which doesn't happen very often where they didn't then

55:50.900 --> 55:51.980
 escalate it into firing.

55:51.980 --> 55:53.860
 And there's a bunch of these different ones.

55:53.860 --> 55:56.660
 Stanislav Petrov, like saved the person

55:56.660 --> 55:57.940
 who should be the most famous person on earth,

55:57.940 --> 55:59.580
 cause he's probably on expectation,

55:59.580 --> 56:01.180
 saved the most human lives of anyone,

56:01.180 --> 56:05.300
 like billions of people by ignoring Russian orders to fire

56:05.300 --> 56:06.700
 because he felt in his gut that actually

56:06.700 --> 56:07.540
 this was a false alarm.

56:07.540 --> 56:11.060
 And it turned out to be, you know, very hard thing to do.

56:11.060 --> 56:13.500
 And there's so many of those scenarios that I can't help

56:13.500 --> 56:15.900
 but wonder at this point that we aren't having this kind

56:15.900 --> 56:17.940
 of like selection effect thing going on.

56:17.940 --> 56:19.820
 Cause you look back and you're like, geez,

56:19.820 --> 56:20.820
 that's a lot of near misses.

56:20.820 --> 56:22.860
 But of course we don't know the actual probabilities

56:22.860 --> 56:24.340
 that they would have lent each one would have ended up

56:24.340 --> 56:25.180
 in nuclear war.

56:25.180 --> 56:27.740
 Maybe they were not that likely, but still the point is,

56:27.740 --> 56:30.900
 it's a very dark, stupid game that we're playing.

56:30.900 --> 56:35.340
 And it is an absolute moral imperative if you ask me

56:35.340 --> 56:37.220
 to get as many people thinking about ways

56:37.220 --> 56:39.540
 to make this like very precarious.

56:39.540 --> 56:41.140
 Cause we're in a Nash equilibrium,

56:41.140 --> 56:42.820
 but it's not like we're in the bottom of a pit.

56:42.820 --> 56:46.380
 You know, if you would like map it topographically,

56:46.380 --> 56:48.380
 it's not like a stable ball at the bottom of a thing.

56:48.380 --> 56:49.420
 We're not in equilibrium because of that.

56:49.420 --> 56:52.380
 We're on the top of a hill with a ball balanced on top.

56:52.380 --> 56:55.580
 And just at any little nudge could send it flying down

56:55.580 --> 56:57.100
 and you know, nuclear war pops off

56:57.100 --> 56:58.900
 and hellfire and bad times.

57:00.060 --> 57:01.100
 On the positive side,

57:01.100 --> 57:03.220
 life on earth will probably still continue.

57:03.220 --> 57:06.220
 And another intelligent civilization might still pop up.

57:06.220 --> 57:07.060
 Maybe.

57:07.060 --> 57:08.420
 Several millennia after.

57:08.420 --> 57:10.180
 Pick your X risk, depends on the X risk.

57:10.180 --> 57:11.020
 Nuclear war, sure.

57:11.020 --> 57:12.820
 That's one of the perhaps less bad ones.

57:12.820 --> 57:17.620
 Green goo through synthetic biology, very bad.

57:17.620 --> 57:22.220
 Will turn, you know, destroy all, you know,

57:22.220 --> 57:25.740
 organic matter through, you know,

57:25.740 --> 57:28.140
 it's basically like a biological paperclip maximizer.

57:28.140 --> 57:28.980
 Also bad.

57:28.980 --> 57:32.540
 Or AI type, you know, mass extinction thing as well

57:32.540 --> 57:33.380
 would also be bad.

57:33.380 --> 57:35.060
 Shh, they're listening.

57:35.060 --> 57:36.500
 There's a robot right behind you.

57:36.500 --> 57:37.340
 Okay, wait.

57:37.340 --> 57:40.380
 So let me ask you about this from a game theory perspective.

57:40.380 --> 57:42.300
 Do you think we're living in a simulation?

57:42.300 --> 57:44.700
 Do you think we're living inside a video game

57:44.700 --> 57:45.980
 created by somebody else?

57:48.100 --> 57:50.220
 Well, so what was the second part of the question?

57:50.220 --> 57:52.620
 Do I think we're living in a simulation and?

57:52.620 --> 57:56.660
 A simulation that is observed by somebody

57:56.660 --> 57:58.620
 for purpose of entertainment.

57:58.620 --> 57:59.660
 So like a video game.

57:59.660 --> 58:00.500
 Are we listening?

58:00.500 --> 58:03.140
 Are we, because there's a,

58:03.140 --> 58:05.260
 it's like Phil Hellmuth type of situation, right?

58:05.260 --> 58:09.940
 Like there's a creepy level of like,

58:09.940 --> 58:12.660
 this is kind of fun and interesting.

58:13.700 --> 58:16.940
 Like there's a lot of interesting stuff going on.

58:16.940 --> 58:18.820
 Maybe that could be somehow integrated

58:18.820 --> 58:23.660
 into the evolutionary process where the way we perceive

58:23.660 --> 58:24.500
 and are.

58:24.500 --> 58:26.020
 Are you asking me if I believe in God?

58:27.340 --> 58:28.820
 Sounds like it.

58:28.820 --> 58:33.820
 Kind of, but God seems to be not optimizing

58:33.980 --> 58:37.420
 in the different formulations of God that we conceive of.

58:37.420 --> 58:39.940
 He doesn't seem to be, or she, optimizing

58:39.940 --> 58:42.700
 for like personal entertainment.

58:44.220 --> 58:45.860
 Maybe the older gods did.

58:45.860 --> 58:49.820
 But the, you know, just like, basically like a teenager

58:49.820 --> 58:54.180
 in their mom's basement watching, create a fun universe

58:54.180 --> 58:58.500
 to observe what kind of crazy shit might happen.

58:58.500 --> 59:00.100
 Okay, so to try and answer this.

59:00.100 --> 59:05.100
 Do I think there is some kind of extraneous intelligence

59:11.340 --> 59:16.220
 to like our, you know, classic measurable universe

59:16.220 --> 59:18.220
 that we, you know, can measure with, you know,

59:18.220 --> 59:23.220
 through our current physics and instruments?

59:23.780 --> 59:25.100
 I think so, yes.

59:25.100 --> 59:29.100
 Partly because I've had just small little bits of evidence

59:29.100 --> 59:32.300
 in my own life, which have made me question.

59:32.300 --> 59:36.300
 Like, so I was a diehard atheist, even five years ago.

59:37.460 --> 59:39.820
 You know, I got into like the rationality community,

59:39.820 --> 59:43.820
 big fan of less wrong, continue to be an incredible resource.

59:45.140 --> 59:49.140
 But I've just started to have too many little snippets

59:49.140 --> 59:54.140
 of experience, which don't make sense with the current sort

59:54.140 --> 59:59.140
 of purely materialistic explanation of how reality works.

1:00:04.540 --> 1:00:09.540
 Isn't that just like a humbling, practical realization

1:00:09.540 --> 1:00:12.540
 that we don't know how reality works?

1:00:12.540 --> 1:00:15.620
 Isn't that just a reminder to yourself that you're

1:00:15.620 --> 1:00:19.340
 like, I don't know how reality works, isn't that just

1:00:19.340 --> 1:00:20.180
 a reminder to yourself?

1:00:20.180 --> 1:00:22.500
 Yeah, no, it's a reminder of epistemic humility

1:00:22.500 --> 1:00:25.460
 because I fell too hard, you know, same as people,

1:00:25.460 --> 1:00:27.580
 like I think, you know, many people who are just like,

1:00:27.580 --> 1:00:29.380
 my religion is the way, this is the correct way,

1:00:29.380 --> 1:00:32.260
 this is the work, this is the law, you are immoral

1:00:32.260 --> 1:00:33.620
 if you don't follow this, blah, blah, blah.

1:00:33.620 --> 1:00:36.060
 I think they are lacking epistemic humility.

1:00:36.060 --> 1:00:38.100
 They're a little too much hubris there.

1:00:38.100 --> 1:00:40.380
 But similarly, I think that sort of the Richard Dawkins

1:00:40.380 --> 1:00:45.380
 realism is too rigid as well and doesn't, you know,

1:00:48.580 --> 1:00:51.020
 there's a way to try and navigate these questions

1:00:51.020 --> 1:00:52.780
 which still honors the scientific method,

1:00:52.780 --> 1:00:54.820
 which I still think is our best sort of realm

1:00:54.820 --> 1:00:57.620
 of like reasonable inquiry, you know, a method of inquiry.

1:00:58.940 --> 1:01:03.340
 So an example, two kind of notable examples

1:01:03.340 --> 1:01:06.660
 that like really rattled my cage.

1:01:06.660 --> 1:01:09.340
 The first one was actually in 2010 early on

1:01:09.340 --> 1:01:13.460
 in quite early on in my poker career.

1:01:13.460 --> 1:01:18.460
 And I, remember the Icelandic volcano that erupted

1:01:19.540 --> 1:01:22.700
 that like shut down kind of all Atlantic airspace.

1:01:22.700 --> 1:01:25.260
 And it meant I got stuck down in the South of France.

1:01:25.260 --> 1:01:27.140
 I was there for something else.

1:01:27.140 --> 1:01:29.900
 And I couldn't get home and someone said,

1:01:29.900 --> 1:01:31.860
 well, there's a big poker tournament happening in Italy.

1:01:31.860 --> 1:01:32.980
 Maybe, do you wanna go?

1:01:32.980 --> 1:01:33.820
 I was like, all right, sure.

1:01:33.820 --> 1:01:35.860
 Like, let's, you know, got a train across,

1:01:35.860 --> 1:01:37.860
 found a way to get there.

1:01:37.860 --> 1:01:39.860
 And the buy in was 5,000 euros,

1:01:39.860 --> 1:01:42.500
 which was much bigger than my bankroll would normally allow.

1:01:42.500 --> 1:01:46.620
 And so I played a feeder tournament, won my way in

1:01:46.620 --> 1:01:49.820
 kind of like I did with the Monte Carlo big one.

1:01:49.820 --> 1:01:50.900
 So then I won my way, you know,

1:01:50.900 --> 1:01:54.180
 from 500 euros into 5,000 euros to play this thing.

1:01:54.180 --> 1:01:57.980
 And on day one of then the big tournament,

1:01:57.980 --> 1:01:58.980
 which turned out to have,

1:01:58.980 --> 1:02:00.860
 it was the biggest tournament ever held in Europe

1:02:00.860 --> 1:02:01.700
 at the time.

1:02:01.700 --> 1:02:04.540
 It got over like 1,200 people, absolutely huge.

1:02:04.540 --> 1:02:08.380
 And I remember they dimmed the lights for before, you know,

1:02:08.380 --> 1:02:10.220
 the normal shuffle up and deal

1:02:10.220 --> 1:02:12.100
 to tell everyone to start playing.

1:02:12.100 --> 1:02:16.100
 And they played Chemical Brothers, Hey Boy, Hey Girl,

1:02:16.100 --> 1:02:17.380
 which I don't know why it's notable,

1:02:17.380 --> 1:02:18.380
 but it was just like a really,

1:02:18.380 --> 1:02:19.220
 it was a song I always liked.

1:02:19.220 --> 1:02:21.220
 It was like one of these like pump me up songs.

1:02:21.220 --> 1:02:22.900
 And I was sitting there thinking, oh yeah, it's exciting.

1:02:22.900 --> 1:02:24.580
 I'm playing this really big tournament.

1:02:24.580 --> 1:02:29.380
 And out of nowhere, just suddenly this voice in my head,

1:02:29.380 --> 1:02:32.220
 just, and it sounded like my own sort of, you know,

1:02:32.220 --> 1:02:34.980
 when you think in your mind, you hear a voice kind of, right?

1:02:34.980 --> 1:02:35.820
 At least I do.

1:02:36.780 --> 1:02:38.620
 And so it sounded like my own voice and it said,

1:02:38.620 --> 1:02:41.220
 you are going to win this tournament.

1:02:41.220 --> 1:02:44.220
 And it was so powerful that I got this like wave of like,

1:02:44.220 --> 1:02:46.780
 you know, sort of goosebumps down my body.

1:02:46.780 --> 1:02:48.780
 And that I even, I remember looking around being like,

1:02:48.780 --> 1:02:49.820
 did anyone else hear that?

1:02:49.820 --> 1:02:51.020
 And obviously people are in their phones,

1:02:51.020 --> 1:02:51.860
 like no one else heard it.

1:02:51.860 --> 1:02:56.700
 And I was like, okay, six days later,

1:02:56.700 --> 1:02:59.780
 I win the fucking tournament out of 1,200 people.

1:02:59.780 --> 1:03:04.780
 And I don't know how to explain it.

1:03:08.780 --> 1:03:13.380
 Okay, yes, maybe I have that feeling

1:03:13.380 --> 1:03:14.620
 before every time I play.

1:03:14.620 --> 1:03:16.140
 And it's just that I happened to, you know,

1:03:16.140 --> 1:03:18.820
 because I won the tournament, I retroactively remembered it.

1:03:18.820 --> 1:03:19.660
 But that's just.

1:03:19.660 --> 1:03:22.300
 Or the feeling gave you a kind of,

1:03:22.300 --> 1:03:24.940
 now from the film, Helmutian.

1:03:24.940 --> 1:03:25.780
 Well, exactly.

1:03:25.780 --> 1:03:28.340
 Like it gave you a confident, a deep confidence.

1:03:28.340 --> 1:03:29.180
 And it did.

1:03:29.180 --> 1:03:30.020
 It definitely did.

1:03:30.020 --> 1:03:32.060
 Like, I remember then feeling this like sort of,

1:03:32.060 --> 1:03:33.980
 well, although I remember then on day one,

1:03:33.980 --> 1:03:35.900
 I then went and lost half my stack quite early on.

1:03:35.900 --> 1:03:37.700
 And I remember thinking like, oh, well, that was bullshit.

1:03:37.700 --> 1:03:40.260
 You know, what kind of premonition is this?

1:03:40.260 --> 1:03:41.100
 Thinking, oh, I'm out.

1:03:41.100 --> 1:03:42.940
 But you know, I managed to like keep it together

1:03:42.940 --> 1:03:46.060
 and recover and then just went like pretty perfectly

1:03:46.060 --> 1:03:47.420
 from then on.

1:03:47.420 --> 1:03:51.100
 And either way, it definitely instilled me

1:03:51.100 --> 1:03:52.780
 with this confidence.

1:03:52.780 --> 1:03:55.820
 And I don't want to put, I can't put an explanation.

1:03:55.820 --> 1:04:00.820
 Like, you know, was it some, you know, huge extra to extra,

1:04:01.460 --> 1:04:03.980
 you know, supernatural thing driving me?

1:04:03.980 --> 1:04:06.540
 Or was it just my own self confidence in someone

1:04:06.540 --> 1:04:07.980
 that just made me make the right decisions?

1:04:07.980 --> 1:04:08.860
 I don't know.

1:04:08.860 --> 1:04:10.660
 And I don't, I'm not going to put a frame on it.

1:04:10.660 --> 1:04:11.500
 And I think.

1:04:11.500 --> 1:04:12.420
 I think I know a good explanation.

1:04:12.420 --> 1:04:14.740
 So we're a bunch of NPCs living in this world

1:04:14.740 --> 1:04:16.580
 created by, in the simulation.

1:04:16.580 --> 1:04:20.300
 And then people, not people, creatures from outside

1:04:20.300 --> 1:04:23.140
 of the simulation sort of can tune in

1:04:23.140 --> 1:04:24.220
 and play your character.

1:04:24.220 --> 1:04:27.220
 And that feeling you got is somebody just like,

1:04:27.220 --> 1:04:29.300
 they got to play a poker tournament through you.

1:04:29.300 --> 1:04:30.660
 Honestly, it felt like that.

1:04:30.660 --> 1:04:33.100
 It did actually feel a little bit like that.

1:04:33.100 --> 1:04:35.180
 But it's been 12 years now.

1:04:35.180 --> 1:04:36.700
 I've retold the story many times.

1:04:36.700 --> 1:04:38.940
 Like, I don't even know how much I can trust my memory.

1:04:38.940 --> 1:04:41.500
 You're just an NPC retelling the same story.

1:04:41.500 --> 1:04:43.780
 Because they just played the tournament and left.

1:04:43.780 --> 1:04:44.780
 Yeah, they're like, oh, that was fun.

1:04:44.780 --> 1:04:45.620
 Cool.

1:04:45.620 --> 1:04:46.460
 Yeah, cool.

1:04:46.460 --> 1:04:47.300
 Next time.

1:04:47.300 --> 1:04:49.260
 And now you're for the rest of your life left

1:04:49.260 --> 1:04:51.860
 as a boring NPC retelling this story of greatness.

1:04:51.860 --> 1:04:53.700
 But it was, and what was interesting was that after that,

1:04:53.700 --> 1:04:55.620
 then I didn't obviously win a major tournament

1:04:55.620 --> 1:04:56.780
 for quite a long time.

1:04:56.780 --> 1:05:01.180
 And it left, that was actually another sort of dark period

1:05:01.180 --> 1:05:02.780
 because I had this incredible,

1:05:02.780 --> 1:05:04.340
 like the highs of winning that,

1:05:04.340 --> 1:05:06.180
 just on a like material level were insane,

1:05:06.180 --> 1:05:07.060
 winning the money.

1:05:07.060 --> 1:05:08.540
 I was on the front page of newspapers

1:05:08.540 --> 1:05:10.220
 because there was like this girl that came out of nowhere

1:05:10.220 --> 1:05:12.180
 and won this big thing.

1:05:12.180 --> 1:05:14.820
 And so again, like sort of chasing that feeling

1:05:14.820 --> 1:05:16.700
 was difficult.

1:05:16.700 --> 1:05:18.140
 But then on top of that, there was this feeling

1:05:18.140 --> 1:05:22.340
 of like almost being touched by something bigger

1:05:22.340 --> 1:05:24.060
 that was like, ah.

1:05:24.060 --> 1:05:26.580
 So maybe, did you have a sense

1:05:26.580 --> 1:05:29.540
 that I might be somebody special?

1:05:29.540 --> 1:05:31.860
 Like this kind of,

1:05:34.340 --> 1:05:36.540
 I think that's the confidence thing

1:05:36.540 --> 1:05:40.740
 that maybe you could do something special in this world

1:05:40.740 --> 1:05:42.300
 after all kind of feeling.

1:05:42.300 --> 1:05:45.340
 I definitely, I mean, this is the thing

1:05:45.340 --> 1:05:48.220
 I think everybody wrestles with to an extent, right?

1:05:48.220 --> 1:05:51.540
 We are truly the protagonists in our own lives.

1:05:51.540 --> 1:05:54.620
 And so it's a natural bias, human bias

1:05:54.620 --> 1:05:58.860
 to feel special.

1:05:58.860 --> 1:06:00.820
 And I think, and in some ways we are special.

1:06:00.820 --> 1:06:01.940
 Every single person is special

1:06:01.940 --> 1:06:04.660
 because you are that, the universe does,

1:06:04.660 --> 1:06:06.220
 the world literally does revolve around you.

1:06:06.220 --> 1:06:08.580
 That's the thing in some respect.

1:06:08.580 --> 1:06:10.540
 But of course, if you then zoom out

1:06:10.540 --> 1:06:12.140
 and take the amalgam of everyone's experiences,

1:06:12.140 --> 1:06:12.980
 then no, it doesn't.

1:06:12.980 --> 1:06:15.700
 So there is this shared sort of objective reality,

1:06:15.700 --> 1:06:17.740
 but sorry, there's objective reality that is shared,

1:06:17.740 --> 1:06:19.260
 but then there's also this subjective reality

1:06:19.260 --> 1:06:20.740
 which is truly unique to you.

1:06:20.740 --> 1:06:22.300
 And I think both of those things coexist.

1:06:22.300 --> 1:06:24.460
 And it's not like one is correct and one isn't.

1:06:24.460 --> 1:06:26.300
 And again, anyone who's like,

1:06:26.300 --> 1:06:28.180
 oh no, your lived experience is everything

1:06:28.180 --> 1:06:30.100
 versus your lived experience is nothing.

1:06:30.100 --> 1:06:32.500
 No, it's a blend between these two things.

1:06:32.500 --> 1:06:33.860
 They can exist concurrently.

1:06:33.860 --> 1:06:35.300
 But there's a certain kind of sense

1:06:35.300 --> 1:06:36.780
 that at least I've had my whole life.

1:06:36.780 --> 1:06:38.500
 And I think a lot of people have this as like,

1:06:38.500 --> 1:06:40.980
 well, I'm just like this little person.

1:06:40.980 --> 1:06:42.900
 Surely I can't be one of those people

1:06:42.900 --> 1:06:46.540
 that do the big thing, right?

1:06:46.540 --> 1:06:48.660
 There's all these big people doing big things.

1:06:48.660 --> 1:06:53.420
 There's big actors and actresses, big musicians.

1:06:53.420 --> 1:06:57.060
 There's big business owners and all that kind of stuff,

1:06:57.060 --> 1:06:58.700
 scientists and so on.

1:06:58.700 --> 1:07:02.420
 I have my own subject experience that I enjoy and so on,

1:07:02.420 --> 1:07:04.860
 but there's like a different layer.

1:07:04.860 --> 1:07:09.460
 Like surely I can't do those great things.

1:07:09.460 --> 1:07:11.500
 I mean, one of the things just having interacted

1:07:11.500 --> 1:07:14.140
 with a lot of great people, I realized,

1:07:14.140 --> 1:07:19.140
 no, they're like just the same humans as me.

1:07:20.060 --> 1:07:22.140
 And that realization I think is really empowering.

1:07:22.140 --> 1:07:24.180
 And to remind yourself.

1:07:24.180 --> 1:07:25.020
 What are they?

1:07:25.020 --> 1:07:25.860
 Huh?

1:07:25.860 --> 1:07:26.700
 What are they?

1:07:26.700 --> 1:07:27.540
 Are they?

1:07:27.540 --> 1:07:29.020
 Well, in terms of.

1:07:29.020 --> 1:07:30.220
 Depends on some, yeah.

1:07:30.220 --> 1:07:33.900
 They're like a bag of insecurities and.

1:07:33.900 --> 1:07:34.740
 Yes.

1:07:36.940 --> 1:07:41.300
 Peculiar sort of, like their own little weirdnesses

1:07:41.300 --> 1:07:44.900
 and so on, I should say also not.

1:07:48.020 --> 1:07:50.140
 They have the capacity for brilliance,

1:07:50.140 --> 1:07:52.860
 but they're not generically brilliant.

1:07:52.860 --> 1:07:55.740
 Like, you know, we tend to say this person

1:07:55.740 --> 1:07:59.620
 or that person is brilliant, but really no,

1:07:59.620 --> 1:08:02.740
 they're just like sitting there and thinking through stuff

1:08:02.740 --> 1:08:04.780
 just like the rest of us.

1:08:04.780 --> 1:08:05.620
 Right.

1:08:05.620 --> 1:08:08.100
 I think they're in the habit of thinking through stuff

1:08:08.100 --> 1:08:13.020
 seriously and they've built up a habit of not allowing them,

1:08:13.020 --> 1:08:15.020
 their mind to get trapped in a bunch of bullshit

1:08:15.020 --> 1:08:16.980
 and minutia of day to day life.

1:08:16.980 --> 1:08:20.020
 They really think big ideas, but those big ideas,

1:08:21.420 --> 1:08:24.700
 it's like allowing yourself the freedom to think big,

1:08:24.700 --> 1:08:27.980
 to realize that you can be one that actually solved

1:08:27.980 --> 1:08:29.260
 this particular big problem.

1:08:29.260 --> 1:08:31.300
 First identify a big problem that you care about,

1:08:31.300 --> 1:08:33.220
 then like, I can actually be the one

1:08:33.220 --> 1:08:34.860
 that solves this problem.

1:08:34.860 --> 1:08:37.260
 And like allowing yourself to believe that.

1:08:37.260 --> 1:08:39.380
 And I think sometimes you do need to have like

1:08:39.380 --> 1:08:41.700
 that shock go through your body and a voice tells you,

1:08:41.700 --> 1:08:42.900
 you're gonna win this tournament.

1:08:42.900 --> 1:08:43.740
 Well, exactly.

1:08:43.740 --> 1:08:48.740
 And whether it was, it's this idea of useful fictions.

1:08:50.500 --> 1:08:53.020
 So again, like going through all like

1:08:53.020 --> 1:08:55.500
 the classic rationalist training of Les Wrong

1:08:55.500 --> 1:08:57.460
 where it's like, you want your map,

1:08:57.460 --> 1:09:00.100
 you know, the image you have of the world in your head

1:09:00.100 --> 1:09:04.380
 to as accurately match up with how the world actually is.

1:09:04.380 --> 1:09:06.900
 You want the map and the territory to perfectly align

1:09:06.900 --> 1:09:08.380
 as, you know, you want it to be

1:09:08.380 --> 1:09:10.980
 as an accurate representation as possible.

1:09:11.860 --> 1:09:13.860
 I don't know if I fully subscribed to that anymore,

1:09:13.860 --> 1:09:17.420
 having now had these moments of like feeling of something

1:09:17.420 --> 1:09:20.340
 either bigger or just actually just being overconfident.

1:09:20.340 --> 1:09:23.700
 Like there is value in overconfidence sometimes.

1:09:23.700 --> 1:09:25.780
 If you, you know, take, you know,

1:09:25.780 --> 1:09:30.540
 take Magnus Carlsen, right?

1:09:30.540 --> 1:09:32.260
 If he, I'm sure from a young age,

1:09:32.260 --> 1:09:34.380
 he knew he was very talented,

1:09:34.380 --> 1:09:37.340
 but I wouldn't be surprised if he was also had something

1:09:37.340 --> 1:09:40.260
 in him to, well, actually maybe he's a bad example

1:09:40.260 --> 1:09:42.580
 because he truly is the world's greatest,

1:09:42.580 --> 1:09:44.380
 but someone who it was unclear

1:09:44.380 --> 1:09:45.620
 whether they were gonna be the world's greatest,

1:09:45.620 --> 1:09:47.260
 but ended up doing extremely well

1:09:47.260 --> 1:09:50.220
 because they had this innate, deep self confidence,

1:09:50.220 --> 1:09:53.060
 this like even overblown idea

1:09:53.060 --> 1:09:54.860
 of how good their relative skill level is.

1:09:54.860 --> 1:09:56.900
 That gave them the confidence to then pursue this thing

1:09:56.900 --> 1:10:00.380
 and they're like with the kind of focus and dedication

1:10:00.380 --> 1:10:02.380
 that it requires to excel in whatever it is

1:10:02.380 --> 1:10:03.420
 you're trying to do, you know?

1:10:03.420 --> 1:10:06.060
 And so there are these useful fictions

1:10:06.060 --> 1:10:09.540
 and that's where I think I diverge slightly

1:10:09.540 --> 1:10:13.420
 with the classic sort of rationalist community

1:10:14.620 --> 1:10:19.620
 because that's a field that is worth studying

1:10:21.300 --> 1:10:23.220
 of like how the stories we tell,

1:10:23.220 --> 1:10:25.020
 what the stories we tell to ourselves,

1:10:25.020 --> 1:10:26.220
 even if they are actually false,

1:10:26.220 --> 1:10:28.980
 and even if we suspect they might be false,

1:10:28.980 --> 1:10:30.660
 how it's better to sort of have that like little bit

1:10:30.660 --> 1:10:34.380
 of faith, like value in faith, I think actually.

1:10:34.380 --> 1:10:35.860
 And that's partly another thing

1:10:35.860 --> 1:10:40.620
 that's now led me to explore the concept of God,

1:10:40.620 --> 1:10:42.940
 whether you wanna call it a simulator,

1:10:42.940 --> 1:10:44.300
 the classic theological thing.

1:10:44.300 --> 1:10:46.460
 I think we're all like elucidating to the same thing.

1:10:46.460 --> 1:10:47.780
 Now, I don't know, I'm not saying,

1:10:47.780 --> 1:10:49.180
 because obviously the Christian God

1:10:49.180 --> 1:10:53.500
 is like all benevolent, endless love.

1:10:53.500 --> 1:10:56.700
 The simulation, at least one of the simulation hypothesis

1:10:56.700 --> 1:10:58.700
 is like, as you said, like a teenager in his bedroom

1:10:58.700 --> 1:11:00.340
 who doesn't really care, doesn't give a shit

1:11:00.340 --> 1:11:02.580
 about the individuals within there.

1:11:02.580 --> 1:11:05.140
 It just like wants to see how the thing plays out

1:11:05.140 --> 1:11:07.620
 because it's curious and it could turn it off like that.

1:11:07.620 --> 1:11:09.900
 Where on the sort of psychopathy

1:11:09.900 --> 1:11:13.820
 to benevolent spectrum God is, I don't know.

1:11:13.820 --> 1:11:18.820
 But just having a little bit of faith

1:11:20.180 --> 1:11:21.700
 that there is something else out there

1:11:21.700 --> 1:11:24.340
 that might be interested in our outcome

1:11:24.340 --> 1:11:27.940
 is I think an essential thing actually for people to find.

1:11:27.940 --> 1:11:29.860
 A, because it creates commonality between,

1:11:29.860 --> 1:11:31.860
 it's something we can all share.

1:11:31.860 --> 1:11:35.020
 And it is uniquely humbling of all of us to an extent.

1:11:35.020 --> 1:11:36.860
 It's like a common objective.

1:11:37.900 --> 1:11:41.580
 But B, it gives people that little bit of like reserve

1:11:41.580 --> 1:11:43.380
 when things get really dark.

1:11:43.380 --> 1:11:44.860
 And I do think things are gonna get pretty dark

1:11:44.860 --> 1:11:46.060
 over the next few years.

1:11:47.180 --> 1:11:48.260
 But it gives that like,

1:11:49.260 --> 1:11:50.780
 to think that there's something out there

1:11:50.780 --> 1:11:53.140
 that actually wants our game to keep going.

1:11:53.140 --> 1:11:55.020
 I keep calling it the game.

1:11:55.020 --> 1:11:57.660
 It's a thing C and I, we call it the game.

1:11:57.660 --> 1:12:02.660
 You and C is a.k.a. Grimes, we call what the game?

1:12:02.660 --> 1:12:03.900
 Everything, the whole thing?

1:12:03.900 --> 1:12:05.500
 Yeah, we joke about like.

1:12:05.500 --> 1:12:06.820
 So everything is a game.

1:12:06.820 --> 1:12:11.100
 Well, the universe, like what if it's a game

1:12:11.100 --> 1:12:13.580
 and the goal of the game is to figure out like,

1:12:13.580 --> 1:12:16.020
 well, either how to beat it, how to get out of it.

1:12:16.020 --> 1:12:18.820
 Maybe this universe is an escape room,

1:12:18.820 --> 1:12:20.140
 like a giant escape room.

1:12:20.140 --> 1:12:22.900
 And the goal is to figure out,

1:12:22.900 --> 1:12:25.820
 put all the pieces to puzzle, figure out how it works

1:12:25.820 --> 1:12:29.780
 in order to like unlock this like hyperdimensional key

1:12:29.780 --> 1:12:31.260
 and get out beyond what it is.

1:12:31.260 --> 1:12:32.100
 That's.

1:12:32.100 --> 1:12:34.380
 No, but then, so you're saying it's like different levels

1:12:34.380 --> 1:12:36.500
 and it's like a cage within a cage within a cage

1:12:36.500 --> 1:12:38.300
 and never like one cage at a time,

1:12:38.300 --> 1:12:39.980
 you figure out how to escape that.

1:12:41.060 --> 1:12:42.260
 Like a new level up, you know,

1:12:42.260 --> 1:12:44.380
 like us becoming multi planetary would be a level up

1:12:44.380 --> 1:12:46.700
 or us, you know, figuring out how to upload

1:12:46.700 --> 1:12:48.260
 our consciousnesses to the thing.

1:12:48.260 --> 1:12:51.380
 That would probably be a leveling up or spiritually,

1:12:51.380 --> 1:12:53.580
 you know, humanity becoming more combined

1:12:53.580 --> 1:12:56.900
 and less adversarial and bloodthirsty

1:12:56.900 --> 1:12:58.780
 and us becoming a little bit more enlightened.

1:12:58.780 --> 1:12:59.620
 That would be a leveling up.

1:12:59.620 --> 1:13:01.860
 You know, there's many different frames to it,

1:13:01.860 --> 1:13:05.140
 whether it's physical, you know, digital

1:13:05.140 --> 1:13:05.980
 or like metaphysical.

1:13:05.980 --> 1:13:07.380
 I wonder what the levels, I think,

1:13:07.380 --> 1:13:10.900
 I think level one for earth is probably

1:13:10.900 --> 1:13:14.060
 the biological evolutionary process.

1:13:14.060 --> 1:13:18.380
 So going from single cell organisms to early humans.

1:13:18.380 --> 1:13:22.980
 Then maybe level two is whatever's happening inside our minds

1:13:22.980 --> 1:13:26.100
 and creating ideas and creating technologies.

1:13:26.100 --> 1:13:30.220
 That's like evolutionary process of ideas.

1:13:31.340 --> 1:13:34.620
 And then multi planetary is interesting.

1:13:34.620 --> 1:13:35.940
 Is that fundamentally different

1:13:35.940 --> 1:13:37.900
 from what we're doing here on earth?

1:13:37.900 --> 1:13:41.780
 Probably, because it allows us to like exponentially scale.

1:13:41.780 --> 1:13:46.380
 It delays the Malthusian trap, right?

1:13:46.380 --> 1:13:50.380
 It's a way to keep the playing field,

1:13:50.380 --> 1:13:53.380
 to make the playing field get larger

1:13:53.380 --> 1:13:57.260
 so that it can accommodate more of our stuff, more of us.

1:13:57.260 --> 1:13:58.460
 And that's a good thing,

1:13:58.460 --> 1:14:03.460
 but I don't know if it like fully solves this issue of,

1:14:05.740 --> 1:14:06.740
 well, this thing called Moloch,

1:14:06.740 --> 1:14:07.820
 which we haven't talked about yet,

1:14:07.820 --> 1:14:10.660
 but which is basically,

1:14:10.660 --> 1:14:12.740
 I call it the God of unhealthy competition.

1:14:12.740 --> 1:14:13.980
 Yeah, let's go to Moloch.

1:14:13.980 --> 1:14:14.980
 What's Moloch?

1:14:14.980 --> 1:14:18.380
 You did a great video on Moloch and one aspect of it,

1:14:18.380 --> 1:14:20.420
 the application of it to one aspect.

1:14:20.420 --> 1:14:22.420
 Instagram beauty filters.

1:14:22.420 --> 1:14:23.580
 True.

1:14:23.580 --> 1:14:27.340
 Very niche, but I wanted to start off small.

1:14:27.340 --> 1:14:32.340
 So Moloch was originally coined as,

1:14:34.540 --> 1:14:39.540
 well, so apparently back in the like Canaanite times,

1:14:39.540 --> 1:14:41.420
 it was to say ancient Carthaginian,

1:14:41.420 --> 1:14:43.220
 I can never say it Carthaginian,

1:14:43.220 --> 1:14:47.620
 somewhere around like 300 BC or 280, I don't know.

1:14:47.620 --> 1:14:49.700
 There was supposedly this death cult

1:14:49.700 --> 1:14:53.220
 who would sacrifice their children

1:14:53.220 --> 1:14:56.060
 to this awful demon God thing they called Moloch

1:14:56.980 --> 1:14:59.380
 in order to get power to win wars.

1:14:59.380 --> 1:15:00.900
 So really dark, horrible things.

1:15:00.900 --> 1:15:02.580
 And it was literally like about child sacrifice,

1:15:02.580 --> 1:15:04.060
 whether they actually existed or not, we don't know,

1:15:04.060 --> 1:15:05.660
 but in mythology they did.

1:15:05.660 --> 1:15:07.220
 And this God that they worshiped

1:15:07.220 --> 1:15:09.220
 was this thing called Moloch.

1:15:09.220 --> 1:15:10.940
 And then I don't know,

1:15:10.940 --> 1:15:13.660
 it seemed like it was kind of quiet throughout history

1:15:13.660 --> 1:15:15.420
 in terms of mythology beyond that,

1:15:15.420 --> 1:15:20.420
 until this movie Metropolis in 1927 talked about this,

1:15:24.420 --> 1:15:27.020
 you see that there was this incredible futuristic city

1:15:27.020 --> 1:15:29.100
 that everyone was living great in,

1:15:29.100 --> 1:15:31.380
 but then the protagonist goes underground into the sewers

1:15:31.380 --> 1:15:34.260
 and sees that the city is run by this machine.

1:15:34.260 --> 1:15:37.300
 And this machine basically would just like kill the workers

1:15:37.300 --> 1:15:40.060
 all the time because it was just so hard to keep it running.

1:15:40.060 --> 1:15:40.900
 They were always dying.

1:15:40.900 --> 1:15:42.980
 So there was all this suffering that was required

1:15:42.980 --> 1:15:44.540
 in order to keep the city going.

1:15:44.540 --> 1:15:45.900
 And then the protagonist has this vision

1:15:45.900 --> 1:15:48.140
 that this machine is actually this demon Moloch.

1:15:48.140 --> 1:15:50.860
 So again, it's like this sort of like mechanistic consumption

1:15:50.860 --> 1:15:53.820
 of humans in order to get more power.

1:15:54.780 --> 1:15:58.700
 And then Allen Ginsberg wrote a poem in the 60s,

1:15:58.700 --> 1:16:03.060
 which incredible poem called Howl about this thing Moloch.

1:16:04.420 --> 1:16:06.980
 And a lot of people sort of quite understandably

1:16:06.980 --> 1:16:08.740
 take the interpretation of that,

1:16:08.740 --> 1:16:10.820
 that he's talking about capitalism.

1:16:10.820 --> 1:16:13.740
 But then the sort of piece to resistance

1:16:13.740 --> 1:16:16.340
 that's moved Moloch into this idea of game theory

1:16:16.340 --> 1:16:19.140
 was Scott Alexander of Slate Style Codex

1:16:20.540 --> 1:16:21.700
 wrote this incredible,

1:16:21.700 --> 1:16:23.420
 well, literally I think it might be my favorite piece

1:16:23.420 --> 1:16:24.260
 of writing of all time.

1:16:24.260 --> 1:16:26.180
 It's called Meditations on Moloch.

1:16:26.180 --> 1:16:27.540
 Everyone must go read it.

1:16:28.820 --> 1:16:29.660
 And...

1:16:29.660 --> 1:16:30.940
 I say Codex is a blog.

1:16:30.940 --> 1:16:32.300
 It's a blog, yes.

1:16:32.300 --> 1:16:35.220
 We can link to it in the show notes or something, right?

1:16:35.220 --> 1:16:36.060
 No, don't.

1:16:36.060 --> 1:16:38.340
 I, yes, yes.

1:16:38.340 --> 1:16:41.260
 But I like how you assume

1:16:41.260 --> 1:16:43.540
 I have a professional operation going on here.

1:16:43.540 --> 1:16:44.380
 I mean...

1:16:44.380 --> 1:16:45.220
 I shall try to remember to...

1:16:45.220 --> 1:16:46.060
 You were gonna assume.

1:16:46.060 --> 1:16:46.900
 What do you...

1:16:46.900 --> 1:16:48.100
 What are you, what do you want?

1:16:48.100 --> 1:16:49.420
 You're giving the impression of it.

1:16:49.420 --> 1:16:50.700
 Yeah, I'll look, please.

1:16:50.700 --> 1:16:53.260
 If I don't, please somebody in the comments remind me.

1:16:53.260 --> 1:16:54.100
 I'll help you.

1:16:54.100 --> 1:16:55.780
 If you don't know this blog,

1:16:55.780 --> 1:16:59.420
 it's one of the best blogs ever probably.

1:16:59.420 --> 1:17:01.180
 You should probably be following it.

1:17:01.180 --> 1:17:02.020
 Yes.

1:17:02.020 --> 1:17:03.340
 Are blogs still a thing?

1:17:03.340 --> 1:17:04.660
 I think they are still a thing, yeah.

1:17:04.660 --> 1:17:06.220
 Yeah, he's migrated onto Substack,

1:17:06.220 --> 1:17:07.860
 but yeah, it's still a blog.

1:17:07.860 --> 1:17:08.700
 Anyway.

1:17:08.700 --> 1:17:10.860
 Substack better not fuck things up, but...

1:17:10.860 --> 1:17:12.100
 I hope not, yeah.

1:17:12.100 --> 1:17:14.620
 I hope they don't, I hope they don't turn Molochy,

1:17:14.620 --> 1:17:16.700
 which will mean something to people when we continue.

1:17:16.700 --> 1:17:17.540
 Yeah.

1:17:17.540 --> 1:17:19.460
 When I stop interrupting for once.

1:17:19.460 --> 1:17:20.300
 No, no, it's good.

1:17:20.300 --> 1:17:21.140
 Go on, yeah.

1:17:21.140 --> 1:17:22.220
 So anyway, so he writes,

1:17:22.220 --> 1:17:24.940
 he writes this piece, Meditations on Moloch,

1:17:24.940 --> 1:17:28.220
 and basically he analyzes the poem and he's like,

1:17:28.220 --> 1:17:29.700
 okay, so it seems to be something relating

1:17:29.700 --> 1:17:32.460
 to where competition goes wrong.

1:17:32.460 --> 1:17:35.580
 And, you know, Moloch was historically this thing

1:17:35.580 --> 1:17:38.820
 of like where people would sacrifice a thing

1:17:38.820 --> 1:17:40.460
 that they care about, in this case, children,

1:17:40.460 --> 1:17:43.220
 their own children, in order to gain power,

1:17:43.220 --> 1:17:45.340
 a competitive advantage.

1:17:45.340 --> 1:17:48.860
 And if you look at almost everything that sort of goes wrong

1:17:48.860 --> 1:17:52.300
 in our society, it's that same process.

1:17:52.300 --> 1:17:55.020
 So with the Instagram beauty filters thing,

1:17:56.420 --> 1:17:57.900
 you know, if you're trying to become

1:17:57.900 --> 1:18:01.940
 a famous Instagram model,

1:18:01.940 --> 1:18:03.820
 you are incentivized to post the hottest pictures

1:18:03.820 --> 1:18:05.620
 of yourself that you can, you know,

1:18:05.620 --> 1:18:07.220
 you're trying to play that game.

1:18:07.220 --> 1:18:08.660
 There's a lot of hot women on Instagram.

1:18:08.660 --> 1:18:10.020
 How do you compete against them?

1:18:10.020 --> 1:18:11.540
 You post really hot pictures

1:18:11.540 --> 1:18:13.180
 and that's how you get more likes.

1:18:14.220 --> 1:18:16.780
 As technology gets better, you know,

1:18:16.780 --> 1:18:19.260
 more makeup techniques come along.

1:18:19.260 --> 1:18:22.020
 And then more recently, these beauty filters

1:18:22.020 --> 1:18:23.420
 where like at the touch of a button,

1:18:23.420 --> 1:18:26.060
 it makes your face look absolutely incredible

1:18:26.060 --> 1:18:28.660
 compared to your natural face.

1:18:29.540 --> 1:18:30.940
 These technologies come along,

1:18:30.940 --> 1:18:34.580
 it's everyone is incentivized to that short term strategy.

1:18:35.620 --> 1:18:39.020
 But over on net, it's bad for everyone

1:18:39.020 --> 1:18:40.460
 because now everyone is kind of feeling

1:18:40.460 --> 1:18:41.660
 like they have to use these things.

1:18:41.660 --> 1:18:43.060
 And these things like they make you like,

1:18:43.060 --> 1:18:44.380
 the reason why I talked about them in this video

1:18:44.380 --> 1:18:45.860
 is because I noticed it myself, you know,

1:18:45.860 --> 1:18:48.820
 like I was trying to grow my Instagram for a while,

1:18:48.820 --> 1:18:49.660
 I've given up on it now.

1:18:49.660 --> 1:18:52.500
 But yeah, and I noticed these filters,

1:18:52.500 --> 1:18:53.420
 how good they made me look.

1:18:53.420 --> 1:18:56.380
 And I'm like, well, I know that everyone else

1:18:56.380 --> 1:18:57.220
 is kind of doing it.

1:18:57.220 --> 1:18:58.980
 Go subscribe to Liv's Instagram.

1:18:58.980 --> 1:19:01.180
 Please, so I don't have to use the filters.

1:19:01.180 --> 1:19:05.020
 I'll post a bunch of, yeah, make it blow up.

1:19:06.020 --> 1:19:08.460
 So yeah, you felt the pressure actually.

1:19:08.460 --> 1:19:10.980
 Exactly, these short term incentives

1:19:10.980 --> 1:19:13.980
 to do this like, this thing that like either sacrifices

1:19:13.980 --> 1:19:17.300
 your integrity or something else

1:19:17.300 --> 1:19:19.140
 in order to like stay competitive,

1:19:20.100 --> 1:19:22.700
 which on aggregate turns like,

1:19:22.700 --> 1:19:24.820
 creates this like sort of race to the bottom spiral

1:19:24.820 --> 1:19:26.580
 where everyone else ends up in a situation

1:19:26.580 --> 1:19:28.220
 which is worse off than if they hadn't started,

1:19:28.220 --> 1:19:29.300
 you know, than they were before.

1:19:29.300 --> 1:19:33.300
 Kind of like if, like at a football stadium,

1:19:34.300 --> 1:19:36.380
 like the system is so badly designed,

1:19:36.380 --> 1:19:38.140
 a competitive system of like everyone sitting

1:19:38.140 --> 1:19:40.220
 and having a view that if someone at the very front

1:19:40.220 --> 1:19:42.060
 stands up to get an even better view,

1:19:42.060 --> 1:19:43.620
 it forces everyone else behind

1:19:43.620 --> 1:19:45.420
 to like adopt that same strategy

1:19:45.420 --> 1:19:46.980
 just to get to where they were before.

1:19:46.980 --> 1:19:48.700
 But now everyone's stuck standing up.

1:19:48.700 --> 1:19:51.860
 Like, so you need this like top down God's eye coordination

1:19:51.860 --> 1:19:53.820
 to make it go back to the better state.

1:19:53.820 --> 1:19:56.100
 But from within the system, you can't actually do that.

1:19:56.100 --> 1:19:57.660
 So that's kind of what this Moloch thing is.

1:19:57.660 --> 1:20:01.580
 It's this thing that makes people sacrifice values

1:20:01.580 --> 1:20:04.620
 in order to optimize for the winning the game in question,

1:20:04.620 --> 1:20:05.500
 the short term game.

1:20:05.500 --> 1:20:09.740
 But this Moloch, can you attribute it

1:20:09.740 --> 1:20:11.700
 to any one centralized source

1:20:11.700 --> 1:20:13.620
 or is it an emergent phenomena

1:20:13.620 --> 1:20:16.140
 from a large collection of people?

1:20:16.140 --> 1:20:16.980
 Exactly that.

1:20:16.980 --> 1:20:18.860
 It's an emergent phenomena.

1:20:18.860 --> 1:20:21.300
 It's a force of game theory.

1:20:22.220 --> 1:20:25.580
 It's a force of bad incentives on a multi agent system

1:20:25.580 --> 1:20:26.580
 where you've got more, you know,

1:20:26.580 --> 1:20:28.140
 prisoner's dilemma is technically

1:20:28.140 --> 1:20:30.500
 a kind of Moloch system as well,

1:20:30.500 --> 1:20:31.980
 but it's just a two player thing.

1:20:31.980 --> 1:20:35.740
 But another word for Moloch is it multipolar trap.

1:20:35.740 --> 1:20:37.780
 Where basically you just got a lot of different people

1:20:37.780 --> 1:20:40.740
 all competing for some kind of prize.

1:20:40.740 --> 1:20:42.380
 And it would be better

1:20:42.380 --> 1:20:44.740
 if everyone didn't do this one shitty strategy,

1:20:44.740 --> 1:20:47.260
 but because that strategy gives you a short term advantage,

1:20:47.260 --> 1:20:48.500
 everyone's incentivized to do it.

1:20:48.500 --> 1:20:49.860
 And so everyone ends up doing it.

1:20:49.860 --> 1:20:51.980
 So the responsibility for,

1:20:51.980 --> 1:20:54.060
 I mean, social media is a really nice place

1:20:54.060 --> 1:20:56.860
 for a large number of people to play game theory.

1:20:56.860 --> 1:20:59.740
 And so they also have the ability

1:20:59.740 --> 1:21:02.580
 to then design the rules of the game.

1:21:02.580 --> 1:21:05.540
 And is it on them to try to anticipate

1:21:05.540 --> 1:21:07.900
 what kind of like to do the thing

1:21:07.900 --> 1:21:11.100
 that poker players are doing to run simulation?

1:21:11.100 --> 1:21:12.380
 Ideally that would have been great.

1:21:12.380 --> 1:21:15.580
 If, you know, Mark Zuckerberg and Jack

1:21:15.580 --> 1:21:17.260
 and all the, you know, the Twitter founders and everyone,

1:21:17.260 --> 1:21:20.580
 if they had at least just run a few simulations

1:21:20.580 --> 1:21:23.220
 of how their algorithms would, you know,

1:21:23.220 --> 1:21:26.260
 if different types of algorithms would turn out for society,

1:21:26.260 --> 1:21:27.340
 that would have been great.

1:21:27.340 --> 1:21:28.700
 That's really difficult to do

1:21:28.700 --> 1:21:30.420
 that kind of deep philosophical thinking

1:21:30.420 --> 1:21:33.100
 about thinking about humanity actually.

1:21:33.100 --> 1:21:38.100
 So not kind of this level of how do we optimize engagement

1:21:40.580 --> 1:21:42.860
 or what brings people joy in the short term,

1:21:42.860 --> 1:21:45.300
 but how is this thing going to change

1:21:45.300 --> 1:21:47.940
 the way people see the world?

1:21:47.940 --> 1:21:52.940
 How is it gonna get morphed in iterative games played

1:21:52.940 --> 1:21:56.860
 into something that will change society forever?

1:21:56.860 --> 1:21:58.500
 That requires some deep thinking.

1:21:58.500 --> 1:22:02.420
 That's, I hope there's meetings like that inside companies,

1:22:02.420 --> 1:22:03.260
 but I haven't seen them.

1:22:03.260 --> 1:22:04.300
 There aren't, that's the problem.

1:22:04.300 --> 1:22:07.500
 And it's difficult because like,

1:22:07.500 --> 1:22:09.740
 when you're starting up a social media company,

1:22:09.740 --> 1:22:13.940
 you know, you're aware that you've got investors to please,

1:22:13.940 --> 1:22:17.100
 there's bills to pay, you know,

1:22:17.100 --> 1:22:19.940
 there's only so much R&D you can afford to do.

1:22:19.940 --> 1:22:21.940
 You've got all these like incredible pressures,

1:22:21.940 --> 1:22:24.420
 bad incentives to get on and just build your thing

1:22:24.420 --> 1:22:26.620
 as quickly as possible and start making money.

1:22:26.620 --> 1:22:29.100
 And, you know, I don't think anyone intended

1:22:29.100 --> 1:22:32.580
 when they built these social media platforms

1:22:32.580 --> 1:22:33.860
 and just to like preface it.

1:22:33.860 --> 1:22:36.340
 So the reason why, you know, social media is relevant

1:22:36.340 --> 1:22:38.740
 because it's a very good example of like,

1:22:38.740 --> 1:22:42.020
 everyone these days is optimizing for, you know, clicks,

1:22:42.980 --> 1:22:44.780
 whether it's a social media platforms themselves,

1:22:44.780 --> 1:22:47.300
 because, you know, every click gets more, you know,

1:22:47.300 --> 1:22:49.740
 impressions and impressions pay for, you know,

1:22:49.740 --> 1:22:50.980
 they get advertising dollars

1:22:50.980 --> 1:22:53.740
 or whether it's individual influencers

1:22:53.740 --> 1:22:56.100
 or, you know, whether it's a New York Times or whoever,

1:22:56.100 --> 1:22:58.300
 they're trying to get their story to go viral.

1:22:58.300 --> 1:23:00.220
 So everyone's got this bad incentive of using, you know,

1:23:00.220 --> 1:23:02.780
 as you called it, the clickbait industrial complex.

1:23:02.780 --> 1:23:04.220
 That's a very molly key system

1:23:04.220 --> 1:23:06.260
 because everyone is now using worse and worse tactics

1:23:06.260 --> 1:23:09.500
 in order to like try and win this attention game.

1:23:09.500 --> 1:23:14.500
 And yeah, so ideally these companies

1:23:14.620 --> 1:23:17.300
 would have had enough slack in the beginning

1:23:17.300 --> 1:23:19.780
 in order to run these experiments to see,

1:23:19.780 --> 1:23:22.460
 okay, what are the ways this could possibly go wrong

1:23:22.460 --> 1:23:23.300
 for people?

1:23:23.300 --> 1:23:24.700
 What are the ways that Moloch,

1:23:24.700 --> 1:23:26.300
 they should be aware of this concept of Moloch

1:23:26.300 --> 1:23:28.300
 and realize that whenever you have

1:23:28.300 --> 1:23:31.300
 a highly competitive multiagent system,

1:23:31.300 --> 1:23:32.900
 which social media is a classic example of,

1:23:32.900 --> 1:23:34.900
 millions of agents all trying to compete

1:23:34.900 --> 1:23:35.940
 for likes and so on,

1:23:35.940 --> 1:23:39.940
 and you try and bring all this complexity down

1:23:39.940 --> 1:23:41.900
 into like very small metrics,

1:23:41.900 --> 1:23:44.860
 such as number of likes, number of retweets,

1:23:44.860 --> 1:23:46.700
 whatever the algorithm optimizes for,

1:23:46.700 --> 1:23:49.780
 that is a guaranteed recipe for this stuff to go wrong

1:23:49.780 --> 1:23:51.540
 and become a race to the bottom.

1:23:51.540 --> 1:23:53.900
 I think there should be an honesty when founders,

1:23:53.900 --> 1:23:56.380
 I think there's a hunger for that kind of transparency

1:23:56.380 --> 1:23:58.180
 of like, we don't know what the fuck we're doing.

1:23:58.180 --> 1:23:59.700
 This is a fascinating experiment.

1:23:59.700 --> 1:24:02.780
 We're all running as a human civilization.

1:24:02.780 --> 1:24:04.260
 Let's try this out.

1:24:04.260 --> 1:24:06.380
 And like, actually just be honest about this,

1:24:06.380 --> 1:24:10.420
 that we're all like these weird rats in a maze.

1:24:10.420 --> 1:24:12.380
 None of us are controlling it.

1:24:12.380 --> 1:24:15.100
 There's this kind of sense like the founders,

1:24:15.100 --> 1:24:17.540
 the CEO of Instagram or whatever,

1:24:17.540 --> 1:24:19.980
 Mark Zuckerberg has a control and he's like,

1:24:19.980 --> 1:24:21.820
 like with strings playing people.

1:24:21.820 --> 1:24:22.860
 No, they're.

1:24:22.860 --> 1:24:24.580
 He's at the mercy of this is like everyone else.

1:24:24.580 --> 1:24:26.540
 He's just like trying to do his best.

1:24:26.540 --> 1:24:29.260
 And like, I think putting on a smile

1:24:29.260 --> 1:24:32.980
 and doing over polished videos

1:24:32.980 --> 1:24:36.860
 about how Instagram and Facebook are good for you,

1:24:36.860 --> 1:24:39.980
 I think is not the right way to actually ask

1:24:39.980 --> 1:24:43.180
 some of the deepest questions we get to ask as a society.

1:24:43.180 --> 1:24:48.100
 How do we design the game such that we build a better world?

1:24:48.100 --> 1:24:51.700
 I think a big part of this as well is people,

1:24:51.700 --> 1:24:55.700
 there's this philosophy, particularly in Silicon Valley

1:24:56.980 --> 1:24:58.500
 of well, techno optimism,

1:24:58.500 --> 1:25:00.340
 technology will solve all our issues.

1:25:01.300 --> 1:25:03.700
 And there's a steel man argument to that where yes,

1:25:03.700 --> 1:25:05.380
 technology has solved a lot of problems

1:25:05.380 --> 1:25:08.140
 and can potentially solve a lot of future ones.

1:25:08.140 --> 1:25:10.820
 But it can also, it's always a double edged sword.

1:25:10.820 --> 1:25:11.900
 And particularly as you know,

1:25:11.900 --> 1:25:13.420
 technology gets more and more powerful

1:25:13.420 --> 1:25:15.060
 and we've now got like big data

1:25:15.060 --> 1:25:17.300
 and we're able to do all kinds of like

1:25:17.300 --> 1:25:19.500
 psychological manipulation with it and so on.

1:25:22.740 --> 1:25:24.940
 Technology is not a values neutral thing.

1:25:24.940 --> 1:25:26.980
 People think, I used to always think this myself.

1:25:26.980 --> 1:25:28.900
 It's like this naive view that,

1:25:28.900 --> 1:25:30.700
 oh, technology is completely neutral.

1:25:30.700 --> 1:25:33.820
 It's just, it's the humans that either make it good or bad.

1:25:33.820 --> 1:25:36.620
 No, to the point we're at now,

1:25:36.620 --> 1:25:38.020
 the technology that we are creating,

1:25:38.020 --> 1:25:39.420
 they are social technologies.

1:25:39.420 --> 1:25:44.420
 They literally dictate how humans now form social groups

1:25:45.420 --> 1:25:46.260
 and so on beyond that.

1:25:46.260 --> 1:25:47.780
 And beyond that, it also then,

1:25:47.780 --> 1:25:49.580
 that gives rise to like the memes

1:25:49.580 --> 1:25:51.980
 that we then like coalesce around.

1:25:51.980 --> 1:25:54.380
 And that, if you have the stack that way

1:25:54.380 --> 1:25:56.940
 where it's technology driving social interaction,

1:25:56.940 --> 1:26:00.460
 which then drives like memetic culture

1:26:00.460 --> 1:26:04.780
 and like which ideas become popular, that's Moloch.

1:26:04.780 --> 1:26:06.820
 And we need the other way around, we need it.

1:26:06.820 --> 1:26:08.420
 So we need to figure out what are the good memes?

1:26:08.420 --> 1:26:11.820
 What are the good values

1:26:11.820 --> 1:26:15.060
 that we think we need to optimize for

1:26:15.060 --> 1:26:17.180
 that like makes people happy and healthy

1:26:17.180 --> 1:26:21.340
 and like keeps society as robust and safe as possible,

1:26:21.340 --> 1:26:22.820
 then figure out what the social structure

1:26:22.820 --> 1:26:23.660
 around those should be.

1:26:23.660 --> 1:26:25.460
 And only then do we figure out technology,

1:26:25.460 --> 1:26:26.780
 but we're doing the other way around.

1:26:26.780 --> 1:26:31.780
 And as much as I love in many ways

1:26:31.900 --> 1:26:32.940
 the culture of Silicon Valley,

1:26:32.940 --> 1:26:36.020
 and like I do think that technology has,

1:26:36.020 --> 1:26:36.860
 I don't wanna knock it.

1:26:36.860 --> 1:26:38.180
 It's done so many wonderful things for us,

1:26:38.180 --> 1:26:39.220
 same as capitalism.

1:26:40.340 --> 1:26:44.100
 There are, we have to like be honest with ourselves.

1:26:44.100 --> 1:26:47.220
 We're getting to a point where we are losing control

1:26:47.220 --> 1:26:49.580
 of this very powerful machine that we have created.

1:26:49.580 --> 1:26:53.220
 Can you redesign the machine within the game?

1:26:53.220 --> 1:26:57.380
 Can you just have, can you understand the game enough?

1:26:57.380 --> 1:26:58.860
 Okay, this is the game.

1:26:58.860 --> 1:27:01.900
 And this is how we start to reemphasize

1:27:01.900 --> 1:27:03.860
 the memes that matter,

1:27:03.860 --> 1:27:06.740
 the memes that bring out the best in us.

1:27:06.740 --> 1:27:11.340
 You know, like the way I try to be in real life

1:27:11.340 --> 1:27:13.260
 and the way I try to be online

1:27:13.260 --> 1:27:15.900
 is to be about kindness and love.

1:27:15.900 --> 1:27:19.860
 And I feel like I'm sometimes get like criticized

1:27:19.860 --> 1:27:22.040
 for being naive and all those kinds of things.

1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:25.840
 But I feel like I'm just trying to live within this game.

1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:27.520
 I'm trying to be authentic.

1:27:27.520 --> 1:27:31.080
 Yeah, but also like, hey, it's kind of fun to do this.

1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:33.900
 Like you guys should try this too, you know,

1:27:33.900 --> 1:27:37.180
 and that's like trying to redesign

1:27:37.180 --> 1:27:40.020
 some aspects of the game within the game.

1:27:40.940 --> 1:27:41.920
 Is that possible?

1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:46.740
 I don't know, but I think we should try.

1:27:46.740 --> 1:27:48.620
 I don't think we have an option but to try.

1:27:48.620 --> 1:27:51.140
 Well, the other option is to create new companies

1:27:51.140 --> 1:27:55.300
 or to pressure companies that,

1:27:55.300 --> 1:27:59.060
 or anyone who has control of the rules of the game.

1:27:59.060 --> 1:28:01.100
 I think we need to be doing all of the above.

1:28:01.100 --> 1:28:02.980
 I think we need to be thinking hard

1:28:02.980 --> 1:28:06.040
 about what are the kind of positive, healthy memes.

1:28:09.140 --> 1:28:10.900
 You know, as Elon said,

1:28:10.900 --> 1:28:13.620
 he who controls the memes controls the universe.

1:28:13.620 --> 1:28:14.460
 He said that.

1:28:14.460 --> 1:28:16.300
 I think he did, yeah.

1:28:16.300 --> 1:28:17.860
 But there's truth to that.

1:28:17.860 --> 1:28:19.380
 It's very, there is wisdom in that

1:28:19.380 --> 1:28:22.700
 because memes have driven history.

1:28:22.700 --> 1:28:24.900
 You know, we are a cultural species.

1:28:24.900 --> 1:28:27.140
 That's what sets us apart from chimpanzees

1:28:27.140 --> 1:28:27.980
 and everything else.

1:28:27.980 --> 1:28:32.500
 We have the ability to learn and evolve through culture

1:28:32.500 --> 1:28:34.900
 as opposed to biology or like, you know,

1:28:34.900 --> 1:28:37.300
 classic physical constraints.

1:28:37.300 --> 1:28:40.740
 And that means culture is incredibly powerful

1:28:40.740 --> 1:28:43.820
 and we can create and become victim

1:28:43.820 --> 1:28:46.620
 to very bad memes or very good ones.

1:28:46.620 --> 1:28:49.300
 But we do have some agency over which memes,

1:28:49.300 --> 1:28:51.940
 you know, we, but not only put out there,

1:28:51.940 --> 1:28:53.620
 but we also like subscribe to.

1:28:54.540 --> 1:28:56.460
 So I think we need to take that approach.

1:28:56.460 --> 1:28:58.980
 We also need to, you know,

1:28:58.980 --> 1:29:02.740
 because I don't want, I'm making this video right now

1:29:02.740 --> 1:29:03.740
 called The Attention Wars,

1:29:03.740 --> 1:29:05.460
 which is about like how Moloch,

1:29:05.460 --> 1:29:08.500
 like the media machine is this Moloch machine.

1:29:08.500 --> 1:29:11.580
 Well, is this kind of like blind dumb thing

1:29:11.580 --> 1:29:13.140
 where everyone is optimizing for engagement

1:29:13.140 --> 1:29:16.420
 in order to win their share of the attention pie.

1:29:16.420 --> 1:29:17.300
 And then if you zoom out,

1:29:17.300 --> 1:29:19.180
 it's really like Moloch that's pulling the strings

1:29:19.180 --> 1:29:20.860
 because the only thing that benefits from this in the end,

1:29:20.860 --> 1:29:23.980
 you know, like our information ecosystem is breaking down.

1:29:23.980 --> 1:29:26.420
 Like we have, you look at the state of the US,

1:29:26.420 --> 1:29:28.340
 it's in, we're in a civil war.

1:29:28.340 --> 1:29:29.900
 It's just not a physical war.

1:29:29.900 --> 1:29:33.220
 It's an information war.

1:29:33.220 --> 1:29:35.020
 And people are becoming more fractured

1:29:35.020 --> 1:29:37.380
 in terms of what their actual shared reality is.

1:29:37.380 --> 1:29:39.500
 Like truly like an extreme left person,

1:29:39.500 --> 1:29:40.420
 an extreme right person,

1:29:40.420 --> 1:29:43.380
 like they literally live in different worlds

1:29:43.380 --> 1:29:45.220
 in their minds at this point.

1:29:45.220 --> 1:29:47.180
 And it's getting more and more amplified.

1:29:47.180 --> 1:29:50.260
 And this force is like a razor blade

1:29:50.260 --> 1:29:51.860
 pushing through everything.

1:29:51.860 --> 1:29:53.340
 It doesn't matter how innocuous a topic is,

1:29:53.340 --> 1:29:55.220
 it will find a way to split into this,

1:29:55.220 --> 1:29:58.260
 you know, bifurcated cultural and it's fucking terrifying.

1:29:58.260 --> 1:29:59.780
 Because that maximizes the tension.

1:29:59.780 --> 1:30:03.140
 And that's like an emergent Moloch type force

1:30:03.140 --> 1:30:06.820
 that takes anything, any topic

1:30:06.820 --> 1:30:11.140
 and cuts through it so that it can split nicely

1:30:11.140 --> 1:30:12.500
 into two groups.

1:30:12.500 --> 1:30:13.820
 One that's...

1:30:13.820 --> 1:30:16.380
 Well, it's whatever, yeah,

1:30:16.380 --> 1:30:17.980
 all everyone is trying to do within the system

1:30:17.980 --> 1:30:21.180
 is just maximize whatever gets them the most attention

1:30:21.180 --> 1:30:22.300
 because they're just trying to make money

1:30:22.300 --> 1:30:24.460
 so they can keep their thing going, right?

1:30:24.460 --> 1:30:29.140
 And the best emotion for getting attention,

1:30:29.140 --> 1:30:30.820
 well, because it's not just about attention on the internet,

1:30:30.820 --> 1:30:33.020
 it's engagement, that's the key thing, right?

1:30:33.020 --> 1:30:34.380
 In order for something to go viral,

1:30:34.380 --> 1:30:35.940
 you need people to actually engage with it.

1:30:35.940 --> 1:30:38.580
 They need to like comment or retweet or whatever.

1:30:39.740 --> 1:30:42.500
 And of all the emotions that,

1:30:43.540 --> 1:30:45.780
 there's like seven classic shared emotions

1:30:45.780 --> 1:30:47.500
 that studies have found that all humans,

1:30:47.500 --> 1:30:51.020
 even from like previously uncontacted tribes have.

1:30:51.020 --> 1:30:54.620
 Some of those are negative, you know, like sadness,

1:30:54.620 --> 1:30:57.580
 disgust, anger, et cetera, some are positive,

1:30:57.580 --> 1:31:01.140
 happiness, excitement, and so on.

1:31:01.140 --> 1:31:03.540
 The one that happens to be the most useful

1:31:03.540 --> 1:31:05.540
 for the internet is anger.

1:31:05.540 --> 1:31:09.780
 Because anger, it's such an active emotion.

1:31:09.780 --> 1:31:13.060
 If you want people to engage, if someone's scared,

1:31:13.060 --> 1:31:14.700
 and I'm not just like talking out my ass here,

1:31:14.700 --> 1:31:16.540
 there are studies here that have looked into this.

1:31:18.540 --> 1:31:19.580
 Whereas like if someone's like,

1:31:19.580 --> 1:31:22.420
 disgusted or fearful, they actually tend to then be like,

1:31:22.420 --> 1:31:23.500
 oh, I don't wanna deal with this.

1:31:23.500 --> 1:31:25.100
 So they're less likely to actually engage

1:31:25.100 --> 1:31:27.180
 and share it and so on, they're just gonna be like, ugh.

1:31:27.180 --> 1:31:29.700
 Whereas if they're enraged by a thing,

1:31:29.700 --> 1:31:31.980
 well now that triggers all the like,

1:31:31.980 --> 1:31:34.820
 the old tribalism emotions.

1:31:34.820 --> 1:31:37.260
 And so that's how then things get sort of spread,

1:31:37.260 --> 1:31:38.100
 you know, much more easily.

1:31:38.100 --> 1:31:42.180
 They out compete all the other memes in the ecosystem.

1:31:42.180 --> 1:31:46.180
 And so this like, the attention economy,

1:31:46.180 --> 1:31:48.340
 the wheels that make it go around are,

1:31:48.340 --> 1:31:49.740
 is rage.

1:31:49.740 --> 1:31:53.860
 I did a tweet, the problem with raging against the machine

1:31:53.860 --> 1:31:56.020
 is that the machine has learned to feed off rage.

1:31:56.020 --> 1:31:57.860
 Because it is feeding off our rage.

1:31:57.860 --> 1:31:59.180
 That's the thing that's now keeping it going.

1:31:59.180 --> 1:32:01.900
 So the more we get angry, the worse it gets.

1:32:01.900 --> 1:32:04.700
 So the mullet in this attention,

1:32:04.700 --> 1:32:09.700
 in the war of attention is constantly maximizing rage.

1:32:10.260 --> 1:32:12.420
 What it is optimizing for is engagement.

1:32:12.420 --> 1:32:14.300
 And it happens to be that engagement

1:32:14.300 --> 1:32:19.300
 is more propaganda, you know.

1:32:20.460 --> 1:32:23.220
 I mean, it just sounds like everything is putting,

1:32:23.220 --> 1:32:24.500
 more and more things are being put through this

1:32:24.500 --> 1:32:27.020
 like propagandist lens of winning

1:32:27.020 --> 1:32:28.900
 whatever the war is in question.

1:32:28.900 --> 1:32:31.420
 Whether it's the culture war or the Ukraine war, yeah.

1:32:31.420 --> 1:32:33.260
 Well, I think the silver lining of this,

1:32:33.260 --> 1:32:36.540
 do you think it's possible that in the long arc

1:32:36.540 --> 1:32:39.580
 of this process, you actually do arrive

1:32:39.580 --> 1:32:41.820
 at greater wisdom and more progress?

1:32:41.820 --> 1:32:45.100
 It just, in the moment, it feels like people are

1:32:45.100 --> 1:32:47.780
 tearing each other to shreds over ideas.

1:32:47.780 --> 1:32:49.580
 But if you think about it, one of the magic things

1:32:49.580 --> 1:32:51.740
 about democracy and so on, is you have

1:32:51.740 --> 1:32:53.900
 the blue versus red constantly fighting.

1:32:53.900 --> 1:32:58.180
 It's almost like they're in discourse,

1:32:58.180 --> 1:33:01.300
 creating devil's advocate, making devils out of each other.

1:33:01.300 --> 1:33:04.900
 And through that process, discussing ideas.

1:33:04.900 --> 1:33:07.740
 Like almost really embodying different ideas

1:33:07.740 --> 1:33:08.860
 just to yell at each other.

1:33:08.860 --> 1:33:11.660
 And through the yelling, over the period of decades,

1:33:11.660 --> 1:33:15.380
 maybe centuries, figuring out a better system.

1:33:15.380 --> 1:33:17.580
 Like in the moment, it feels fucked up.

1:33:17.580 --> 1:33:20.820
 But in the long arc, it actually is productive.

1:33:20.820 --> 1:33:21.660
 I hope so.

1:33:23.340 --> 1:33:28.340
 That said, we are now in the era of,

1:33:28.460 --> 1:33:30.540
 just as we have weapons of mass destruction

1:33:30.540 --> 1:33:32.420
 with nuclear weapons, you know,

1:33:32.420 --> 1:33:35.260
 that can break the whole playing field,

1:33:35.260 --> 1:33:37.700
 we now are developing weapons

1:33:37.700 --> 1:33:39.420
 of informational mass destruction.

1:33:39.420 --> 1:33:41.940
 Information weapons, you know, WMDs

1:33:41.940 --> 1:33:44.860
 that basically can be used for propaganda

1:33:44.860 --> 1:33:49.540
 or just manipulating people however is needed,

1:33:49.540 --> 1:33:53.100
 whether that's through dumb TikTok videos,

1:33:53.100 --> 1:33:58.100
 or, you know, there are significant resources being put in.

1:33:59.100 --> 1:34:01.500
 I don't mean to sound like, you know,

1:34:01.500 --> 1:34:04.300
 to doom and gloom, but there are bad actors out there.

1:34:04.300 --> 1:34:06.020
 That's the thing, there are plenty of good actors

1:34:06.020 --> 1:34:07.780
 within the system who are just trying to stay afloat

1:34:07.780 --> 1:34:09.820
 in the game, so effectively doing monarchy things.

1:34:09.820 --> 1:34:12.540
 But then on top of that, we have actual bad actors

1:34:12.540 --> 1:34:14.980
 who are intentionally trying to, like,

1:34:14.980 --> 1:34:17.420
 manipulate the other side into doing things.

1:34:17.420 --> 1:34:19.660
 And using, so because it's a digital space,

1:34:19.660 --> 1:34:24.500
 they're able to use artificial actors, meaning bots.

1:34:24.500 --> 1:34:26.180
 Exactly, botnets, you know,

1:34:26.180 --> 1:34:29.780
 and this is a whole new situation

1:34:29.780 --> 1:34:30.900
 that we've never had before.

1:34:30.900 --> 1:34:32.340
 Yeah, it's exciting.

1:34:32.340 --> 1:34:34.020
 You know what I want to do?

1:34:34.020 --> 1:34:36.180
 You know what I want to do that,

1:34:36.180 --> 1:34:38.140
 because there is, you know, people are talking about bots

1:34:38.140 --> 1:34:41.580
 manipulating and, like, malicious bots

1:34:41.580 --> 1:34:43.580
 that are basically spreading propaganda.

1:34:43.580 --> 1:34:46.580
 I want to create, like, a bot army for, like,

1:34:46.580 --> 1:34:47.620
 that fights that. For love?

1:34:47.620 --> 1:34:50.940
 Yeah, exactly, for love, that fights, that, I mean.

1:34:50.940 --> 1:34:52.220
 You know, there's, I mean, there's truth

1:34:52.220 --> 1:34:54.140
 to fight fire with fire, it's like,

1:34:54.140 --> 1:34:57.100
 but how you always have to be careful

1:34:57.100 --> 1:34:59.940
 whenever you create, again, like,

1:34:59.940 --> 1:35:01.860
 Moloch is very tricky. Yeah, yeah.

1:35:01.860 --> 1:35:03.740
 Hitler was trying to spread the love, too.

1:35:03.740 --> 1:35:07.020
 Well, yeah, so we thought, but, you know, I agree with you

1:35:07.020 --> 1:35:09.140
 that, like, that is a thing that should be considered,

1:35:09.140 --> 1:35:11.460
 but there is, again, everyone,

1:35:11.460 --> 1:35:13.580
 the road to hell is paved in good intentions.

1:35:13.580 --> 1:35:18.100
 And this is, there's always unforeseen circumstances,

1:35:18.100 --> 1:35:20.380
 you know, outcomes, externalities

1:35:20.380 --> 1:35:21.420
 of you trying to adopt a thing,

1:35:21.420 --> 1:35:23.580
 even if you do it in the very best of faith.

1:35:23.580 --> 1:35:25.020
 But you can learn lessons of history.

1:35:25.020 --> 1:35:28.540
 If you can run some sims on it first, absolutely.

1:35:28.540 --> 1:35:30.980
 But also there's certain aspects of a system,

1:35:30.980 --> 1:35:33.980
 as we've learned through history, that do better than others.

1:35:33.980 --> 1:35:36.100
 Like, for example, don't have a dictator,

1:35:36.100 --> 1:35:39.620
 so, like, if I were to create this bot army,

1:35:39.620 --> 1:35:42.900
 it's not good for me to have full control over it.

1:35:42.900 --> 1:35:45.340
 Because in the beginning, I might have a good understanding

1:35:45.340 --> 1:35:47.620
 of what's good and not, but over time,

1:35:47.620 --> 1:35:49.140
 that starts to get deviated,

1:35:49.140 --> 1:35:50.700
 because I'll get annoyed at some assholes,

1:35:50.700 --> 1:35:52.540
 and I'll think, okay, wouldn't it be nice

1:35:52.540 --> 1:35:53.980
 to get rid of those assholes?

1:35:53.980 --> 1:35:55.660
 But then that power starts getting to your head,

1:35:55.660 --> 1:35:58.020
 you become corrupted, that's basic human nature.

1:35:58.020 --> 1:35:59.940
 So distribute the power somehow.

1:35:59.940 --> 1:36:04.460
 We need a love botnet on a DAO.

1:36:05.780 --> 1:36:07.780
 A DAO love botnet.

1:36:07.780 --> 1:36:10.700
 Yeah, and without a leader, like without...

1:36:10.700 --> 1:36:12.340
 Well, exactly, a distributed, right,

1:36:12.340 --> 1:36:14.300
 but yeah, without any kind of centralized...

1:36:14.300 --> 1:36:16.100
 Yeah, without even, you know,

1:36:16.100 --> 1:36:17.500
 basically it's the more control,

1:36:17.500 --> 1:36:21.420
 the more you can decentralize the control of a thing

1:36:21.420 --> 1:36:25.180
 to people, you know, but the balance...

1:36:25.180 --> 1:36:26.700
 But then you still need the ability to coordinate,

1:36:26.700 --> 1:36:29.420
 because that's the issue when something is too,

1:36:29.420 --> 1:36:32.460
 you know, that's really, to me, like the culture wars,

1:36:32.460 --> 1:36:35.660
 the bigger war we're dealing with is actually between

1:36:35.660 --> 1:36:39.580
 the sort of the, I don't know what even the term is for it,

1:36:39.580 --> 1:36:41.980
 but like centralization versus decentralization.

1:36:41.980 --> 1:36:44.100
 That's the tension we're seeing.

1:36:44.100 --> 1:36:48.220
 Power in control by a few versus completely distributed.

1:36:48.220 --> 1:36:50.860
 And the trouble is if you have a fully centralized thing,

1:36:50.860 --> 1:36:52.700
 then you're at risk of tyranny, you know,

1:36:52.700 --> 1:36:56.860
 Stalin type things can happen, or completely distributed.

1:36:56.860 --> 1:36:58.500
 Now you're at risk of complete anarchy and chaos

1:36:58.500 --> 1:37:01.100
 but you can't even coordinate to like on, you know,

1:37:01.100 --> 1:37:03.220
 when there's like a pandemic or anything like that.

1:37:03.220 --> 1:37:05.780
 So it's like, what is the right balance to strike

1:37:05.780 --> 1:37:08.100
 between these two structures?

1:37:08.100 --> 1:37:09.660
 Can't Moloch really take hold

1:37:09.660 --> 1:37:11.060
 in a fully decentralized system?

1:37:11.060 --> 1:37:12.500
 That's one of the dangers too.

1:37:12.500 --> 1:37:14.420
 Yes, very vulnerable to Moloch.

1:37:14.420 --> 1:37:17.740
 So a dictator can commit huge atrocities,

1:37:17.740 --> 1:37:20.980
 but they can also make sure the infrastructure works

1:37:20.980 --> 1:37:23.180
 and trains run on time.

1:37:23.180 --> 1:37:24.820
 They have that God's eye view at least.

1:37:24.820 --> 1:37:27.340
 They have the ability to create like laws and rules

1:37:27.340 --> 1:37:30.900
 that like force coordination, which stops Moloch.

1:37:30.900 --> 1:37:33.260
 But then you're vulnerable to that dictator

1:37:33.260 --> 1:37:34.660
 getting infected with like this,

1:37:34.660 --> 1:37:36.940
 with some kind of psychopathy type thing.

1:37:36.940 --> 1:37:39.460
 What's reverse Moloch?

1:37:39.460 --> 1:37:40.580
 Sorry, great question.

1:37:40.580 --> 1:37:45.580
 So that's where, so I've been working on this series.

1:37:46.220 --> 1:37:48.260
 It's been driving me insane for the last year and a half.

1:37:48.260 --> 1:37:50.100
 I did the first one a year ago.

1:37:50.100 --> 1:37:52.060
 I can't believe it's nearly been a year.

1:37:52.060 --> 1:37:53.500
 The second one, hopefully will be coming out

1:37:53.500 --> 1:37:54.340
 in like a month.

1:37:54.340 --> 1:37:58.700
 And my goal at the end of the series is to like present,

1:37:58.700 --> 1:38:00.180
 cause basically I'm painting the picture of like

1:38:00.180 --> 1:38:02.220
 what Moloch is and how it's affecting

1:38:02.220 --> 1:38:04.300
 almost all these issues in our society

1:38:04.300 --> 1:38:06.420
 and how it's driving.

1:38:06.420 --> 1:38:07.940
 It's like kind of the generator function

1:38:07.940 --> 1:38:11.020
 as people describe it of existential risk.

1:38:11.020 --> 1:38:11.860
 And then at the end of that.

1:38:11.860 --> 1:38:14.180
 Wait, wait, the generator function of existential risk.

1:38:14.180 --> 1:38:16.460
 So you're saying Moloch is sort of the engine

1:38:16.460 --> 1:38:19.660
 that creates a bunch of X risks.

1:38:19.660 --> 1:38:20.540
 Yes, not all of them.

1:38:20.540 --> 1:38:22.940
 Like a, you know, a.

1:38:22.940 --> 1:38:24.620
 Just a cool phrase, generator function.

1:38:24.620 --> 1:38:25.460
 It's not my phrase.

1:38:25.460 --> 1:38:26.780
 It's Daniel Schmacktenberger.

1:38:26.780 --> 1:38:27.620
 Oh, Schmacktenberger.

1:38:27.620 --> 1:38:28.460
 I got that from him.

1:38:28.460 --> 1:38:29.300
 Of course.

1:38:29.300 --> 1:38:31.380
 All things, it's like all roads lead back

1:38:31.380 --> 1:38:32.740
 to Daniel Schmacktenberger, I think.

1:38:32.740 --> 1:38:35.220
 The dude is, the dude is brilliant.

1:38:35.220 --> 1:38:36.060
 He's really brilliant.

1:38:36.060 --> 1:38:37.260
 After that it's Mark Twain.

1:38:37.260 --> 1:38:39.540
 But anyway, sorry.

1:38:39.540 --> 1:38:41.140
 Totally rude interruptions from me.

1:38:41.140 --> 1:38:42.020
 No, it's fine.

1:38:42.020 --> 1:38:43.100
 So not all X risks.

1:38:43.100 --> 1:38:45.460
 So like an asteroid technically isn't

1:38:45.460 --> 1:38:47.940
 because it's, you know, it's just like

1:38:47.940 --> 1:38:49.500
 this one big external thing.

1:38:49.500 --> 1:38:51.580
 It's not like a competition thing going on.

1:38:51.580 --> 1:38:54.700
 But, you know, synthetic bio, you know,

1:38:54.700 --> 1:38:57.540
 bio weapons, that's one because everyone's incentivized

1:38:57.540 --> 1:38:59.740
 to build, even for defense, you know,

1:38:59.740 --> 1:39:01.460
 bad, bad viruses, you know,

1:39:01.460 --> 1:39:03.820
 just to threaten someone else, et cetera.

1:39:03.820 --> 1:39:05.820
 Or AI, technically the race to AGI

1:39:05.820 --> 1:39:08.140
 is kind of potentially a Molochi situation.

1:39:09.620 --> 1:39:14.620
 But yeah, so if Moloch is this like generator function

1:39:15.060 --> 1:39:16.780
 that's driving all of these issues

1:39:16.780 --> 1:39:19.100
 over the coming century that might wipe us out,

1:39:19.100 --> 1:39:20.340
 what's the inverse?

1:39:20.340 --> 1:39:24.100
 And so far what I've gotten to is this character

1:39:24.100 --> 1:39:26.660
 that I want to put out there called Winwin.

1:39:26.660 --> 1:39:28.660
 Because Moloch is the God of lose, lose, ultimately.

1:39:28.660 --> 1:39:30.260
 It masquerades as the God of win, lose,

1:39:30.260 --> 1:39:31.780
 but in reality it's lose, lose.

1:39:31.780 --> 1:39:33.460
 Everyone ends up worse off.

1:39:34.380 --> 1:39:35.860
 So I was like, well, what's the opposite of that?

1:39:35.860 --> 1:39:36.700
 It's Winwin.

1:39:36.700 --> 1:39:37.660
 And I was thinking for ages, like,

1:39:37.660 --> 1:39:39.740
 what's a good name for this character?

1:39:39.740 --> 1:39:42.380
 And then tomorrow I was like, okay, well,

1:39:42.380 --> 1:39:44.700
 don't try and, you know, think through it logically.

1:39:44.700 --> 1:39:46.540
 What's the vibe of Winwin?

1:39:46.540 --> 1:39:49.220
 And to me, like in my mind, Moloch is like,

1:39:49.220 --> 1:39:50.580
 and I addressed that in the video,

1:39:50.580 --> 1:39:52.140
 like it's red and black.

1:39:52.140 --> 1:39:55.660
 It's kind of like very, you know, hyper focused

1:39:55.660 --> 1:39:57.580
 on it's one goal you must win.

1:39:58.660 --> 1:40:01.420
 So Winwin is kind of actually like these colors.

1:40:01.420 --> 1:40:03.020
 It's like purple, turquoise.

1:40:04.140 --> 1:40:06.700
 It's loves games too.

1:40:06.700 --> 1:40:08.420
 It loves a little bit of healthy competition,

1:40:08.420 --> 1:40:10.100
 but constrained, like kind of like before,

1:40:10.100 --> 1:40:12.860
 like knows how to ring fence zero sum competition

1:40:12.860 --> 1:40:14.940
 into like just the right amount,

1:40:14.940 --> 1:40:17.460
 whereby its externalities can be controlled

1:40:17.460 --> 1:40:19.180
 and kept positive.

1:40:19.180 --> 1:40:21.260
 And then beyond that, it also loves cooperation,

1:40:21.260 --> 1:40:23.940
 coordination, love, all these other things.

1:40:23.940 --> 1:40:25.860
 But it's also kind of like mischievous,

1:40:26.780 --> 1:40:28.500
 like, you know, it will have a good time.

1:40:28.500 --> 1:40:30.300
 It's not like kind of like boring, you know,

1:40:30.300 --> 1:40:33.460
 like, oh God, it knows how to have fun.

1:40:33.460 --> 1:40:36.020
 It can get like, it can get down,

1:40:36.020 --> 1:40:39.740
 but ultimately it's like unbelievably wise

1:40:39.740 --> 1:40:41.780
 and it just wants the game to keep going.

1:40:42.740 --> 1:40:44.580
 And I call it Winwin.

1:40:44.580 --> 1:40:47.500
 That's a good like pet name, Winwin.

1:40:47.500 --> 1:40:49.900
 I think the, Winwin, right?

1:40:49.900 --> 1:40:51.740
 And I think it's formal name when it has to do

1:40:51.740 --> 1:40:55.020
 like official functions is Omnia.

1:40:55.020 --> 1:40:55.860
 Omnia.

1:40:55.860 --> 1:40:56.700
 Yeah.

1:40:56.700 --> 1:40:59.540
 From like omniscience kind of, why Omnia?

1:40:59.540 --> 1:41:00.380
 You just like Omnia?

1:41:00.380 --> 1:41:01.220
 She's like Omniwin.

1:41:01.220 --> 1:41:02.060
 Omniwin.

1:41:02.060 --> 1:41:02.900
 But I'm open to suggestions.

1:41:02.900 --> 1:41:04.100
 I would like, you know, and this is.

1:41:04.100 --> 1:41:05.100
 I like Omnia.

1:41:05.100 --> 1:41:05.940
 Yeah.

1:41:05.940 --> 1:41:08.740
 But there is an angelic kind of sense to Omnia though.

1:41:08.740 --> 1:41:09.980
 So Winwin is more fun.

1:41:09.980 --> 1:41:14.980
 So it's more like, it embraces the fun aspect.

1:41:14.980 --> 1:41:16.420
 The fun aspect.

1:41:16.420 --> 1:41:18.620
 I mean, there is something about sort of,

1:41:20.500 --> 1:41:23.500
 there's some aspect to Winwin interactions

1:41:23.500 --> 1:41:28.500
 that requires embracing the chaos of the game

1:41:31.580 --> 1:41:33.740
 and enjoying the game itself.

1:41:33.740 --> 1:41:34.580
 I don't know.

1:41:34.580 --> 1:41:35.420
 I don't know what that is.

1:41:35.420 --> 1:41:37.660
 That's almost like a Zen like appreciation

1:41:37.660 --> 1:41:40.500
 of the game itself, not optimizing

1:41:40.500 --> 1:41:42.460
 for the consequences of the game.

1:41:42.460 --> 1:41:45.260
 Right, well, it's recognizing the value

1:41:45.260 --> 1:41:47.180
 of competition in of itself about,

1:41:47.180 --> 1:41:48.700
 it's not like about winning.

1:41:48.700 --> 1:41:51.460
 It's about you enjoying the process of having a competition

1:41:51.460 --> 1:41:52.620
 and not knowing whether you're gonna win

1:41:52.620 --> 1:41:53.900
 or lose this little thing.

1:41:53.900 --> 1:41:56.580
 But then also being aware that, you know,

1:41:56.580 --> 1:41:57.420
 what's the boundary?

1:41:57.420 --> 1:41:59.020
 How big do I want competition to be?

1:41:59.020 --> 1:42:02.660
 Because one of the reason why Moloch is doing so well now

1:42:02.660 --> 1:42:04.820
 in our society, in our civilization is

1:42:04.820 --> 1:42:07.820
 because we haven't been able to ring fence competition.

1:42:07.820 --> 1:42:09.380
 You know, and so it's just having all

1:42:09.380 --> 1:42:10.580
 these negative externalities

1:42:10.580 --> 1:42:13.420
 and it's, we've completely lost control of it.

1:42:13.420 --> 1:42:16.780
 You know, it's, I think my guess is,

1:42:16.780 --> 1:42:18.620
 and now we're getting really like,

1:42:18.620 --> 1:42:20.860
 you know, metaphysical technically,

1:42:20.860 --> 1:42:25.860
 but I think we'll be in a more interesting universe

1:42:26.780 --> 1:42:29.700
 if we have one that has both pure cooperation,

1:42:29.700 --> 1:42:31.340
 you know, lots of cooperation

1:42:31.340 --> 1:42:32.980
 and some pockets of competition

1:42:32.980 --> 1:42:36.220
 than one that's purely competition, cooperation entirely.

1:42:36.220 --> 1:42:39.340
 Like it's good to have some little zero sumness bits,

1:42:39.340 --> 1:42:41.500
 but I don't know that fully

1:42:41.500 --> 1:42:44.100
 and I'm not qualified as a philosopher to know that.

1:42:44.100 --> 1:42:45.460
 And that's what reverse Moloch,

1:42:45.460 --> 1:42:49.620
 so this kind of win, win creature is a system,

1:42:49.620 --> 1:42:52.140
 is an antidote to the Moloch system.

1:42:52.140 --> 1:42:53.580
 Yes.

1:42:53.580 --> 1:42:56.260
 And I don't know how it's gonna do that.

1:42:57.620 --> 1:42:59.980
 But it's good to kind of try to start

1:42:59.980 --> 1:43:01.460
 to formulate different ideas,

1:43:01.460 --> 1:43:03.820
 different frameworks of how we think about that.

1:43:03.820 --> 1:43:04.660
 Exactly.

1:43:04.660 --> 1:43:07.180
 At the small scale of a collection of individuals

1:43:07.180 --> 1:43:09.100
 and a large scale of a society.

1:43:09.100 --> 1:43:09.940
 Exactly.

1:43:09.940 --> 1:43:13.380
 It's a meme, I think it's an example of a good meme.

1:43:13.380 --> 1:43:15.540
 And I'm open, I'd love to hear feedback from people

1:43:15.540 --> 1:43:17.620
 if they think it's, you know, they have a better idea

1:43:17.620 --> 1:43:18.460
 or it's not, you know,

1:43:18.460 --> 1:43:21.660
 but it's the direction of memes that we need to spread,

1:43:21.660 --> 1:43:25.140
 this idea of like, look for the win, wins in life.

1:43:25.140 --> 1:43:27.220
 Well, on the topic of beauty filters,

1:43:27.220 --> 1:43:28.660
 so in that particular context

1:43:28.660 --> 1:43:33.660
 where Moloch creates negative consequences,

1:43:35.140 --> 1:43:37.180
 Dostoevsky said beauty will save the world.

1:43:37.180 --> 1:43:39.140
 What is beauty anyway?

1:43:41.260 --> 1:43:43.780
 It would be nice to just try to discuss

1:43:45.340 --> 1:43:49.300
 what kind of thing we would like to converge towards

1:43:49.300 --> 1:43:52.260
 in our understanding of what is beautiful.

1:43:55.900 --> 1:43:59.220
 So to me, I think something is beautiful

1:43:59.220 --> 1:44:04.220
 when it can't be reduced down to easy metrics.

1:44:04.220 --> 1:44:07.820
 Like if you think of a tree, what is it about a tree,

1:44:07.820 --> 1:44:09.420
 like a big, ancient, beautiful tree, right?

1:44:09.420 --> 1:44:11.780
 What is it about it that we find so beautiful?

1:44:11.780 --> 1:44:16.780
 It's not, you know, the sweetness of its fruit

1:44:17.700 --> 1:44:20.140
 or the value of its lumber.

1:44:20.140 --> 1:44:25.140
 It's this entirety of it that is,

1:44:25.940 --> 1:44:28.020
 there's these immeasurable qualities,

1:44:28.020 --> 1:44:30.020
 it's like almost like a qualia of it.

1:44:30.020 --> 1:44:33.340
 That's both, like it walks this fine line between pattern,

1:44:33.340 --> 1:44:34.620
 well, it's got lots of patternicity,

1:44:34.620 --> 1:44:36.660
 but it's not overly predictable.

1:44:36.660 --> 1:44:39.100
 Again, it walks this fine line between order and chaos.

1:44:39.100 --> 1:44:41.380
 It's a very highly complex system.

1:44:45.380 --> 1:44:47.420
 It's evolving over time,

1:44:47.420 --> 1:44:49.140
 the definition of a complex versus,

1:44:49.140 --> 1:44:50.860
 and this is another Schmackt and Berger thing,

1:44:50.860 --> 1:44:53.500
 a complex versus a complicated system.

1:44:53.500 --> 1:44:55.660
 A complicated system can be sort of broken down

1:44:55.660 --> 1:44:56.980
 into bits and pieces,

1:44:56.980 --> 1:45:00.340
 a complicated system can be sort of broken down into bits,

1:45:00.340 --> 1:45:01.980
 understood and then put back together.

1:45:01.980 --> 1:45:04.740
 A complex system is kind of like a black box.

1:45:04.740 --> 1:45:06.700
 It does all this crazy stuff,

1:45:06.700 --> 1:45:07.940
 but if you take it apart,

1:45:07.940 --> 1:45:09.060
 you can't put it back together again,

1:45:09.060 --> 1:45:11.540
 because there's all these intricacies.

1:45:11.540 --> 1:45:14.740
 And also very importantly, like there's some of the parts,

1:45:14.740 --> 1:45:16.340
 sorry, the sum of the whole is much greater

1:45:16.340 --> 1:45:17.620
 than the sum of the parts.

1:45:17.620 --> 1:45:21.100
 And that's where the beauty lies, I think.

1:45:21.100 --> 1:45:23.300
 And I think that extends to things like art as well.

1:45:23.300 --> 1:45:27.380
 Like there's something immeasurable about it.

1:45:27.380 --> 1:45:29.740
 There's something we can't break down to a narrow metric.

1:45:29.740 --> 1:45:31.580
 Does that extend to humans, you think?

1:45:31.580 --> 1:45:33.580
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:45:33.580 --> 1:45:37.180
 So how can Instagram reveal that kind of beauty,

1:45:37.180 --> 1:45:39.060
 the complexity of a human being?

1:45:39.060 --> 1:45:39.900
 Good question.

1:45:41.820 --> 1:45:44.580
 And this takes us back to dating sites and Goodreads,

1:45:44.580 --> 1:45:45.420
 I think.

1:45:46.420 --> 1:45:47.500
 Very good question.

1:45:47.500 --> 1:45:50.020
 I mean, well, I know what it shouldn't do.

1:45:50.020 --> 1:45:52.980
 It shouldn't try and like, right now,

1:45:52.980 --> 1:45:56.180
 you know, I was talking to like a social media expert

1:45:56.180 --> 1:45:58.020
 recently, because I was like, oh, I hate that.

1:45:58.020 --> 1:45:59.860
 There's such a thing as a social media expert?

1:45:59.860 --> 1:46:02.020
 Oh, yeah, there are like agencies out there

1:46:02.020 --> 1:46:03.220
 that you can like outsource,

1:46:03.220 --> 1:46:05.980
 because I'm thinking about working with one to like,

1:46:06.980 --> 1:46:09.260
 I want to start a podcast.

1:46:09.260 --> 1:46:11.860
 You should, you should have done it a long time ago.

1:46:11.860 --> 1:46:12.860
 Working on it.

1:46:12.860 --> 1:46:14.660
 It's going to be called Win Win.

1:46:14.660 --> 1:46:17.420
 And it's going to be about this like positive sum stuff.

1:46:17.420 --> 1:46:21.140
 And the thing that, you know, they always come back and say,

1:46:21.140 --> 1:46:22.980
 is like, well, you need to like figure out

1:46:22.980 --> 1:46:24.060
 what your thing is.

1:46:24.060 --> 1:46:26.420
 You know, you need to narrow down what your thing is

1:46:26.420 --> 1:46:27.980
 and then just follow that.

1:46:27.980 --> 1:46:31.060
 Have like a sort of a formula,

1:46:31.060 --> 1:46:32.180
 because that's what people want.

1:46:32.180 --> 1:46:33.220
 They want to know that they're coming back

1:46:33.220 --> 1:46:34.260
 to the same thing.

1:46:34.260 --> 1:46:37.420
 And that's the advice on YouTube, Twitter, you name it.

1:46:37.420 --> 1:46:40.180
 And that's why, and the trouble with that

1:46:40.180 --> 1:46:42.460
 is that it's a complexity reduction.

1:46:42.460 --> 1:46:44.100
 And generally speaking, you know,

1:46:44.100 --> 1:46:45.340
 complexity reduction is bad.

1:46:45.340 --> 1:46:48.020
 It's making things more, it's an oversimplification.

1:46:48.020 --> 1:46:51.380
 Not that simplification is always a bad thing.

1:46:51.380 --> 1:46:55.500
 But when you're trying to take, you know,

1:46:55.500 --> 1:46:56.540
 what is social media doing?

1:46:56.540 --> 1:47:00.100
 It's trying to like encapsulate the human experience

1:47:00.100 --> 1:47:04.700
 and put it into digital form and commodify it to an extent.

1:47:04.700 --> 1:47:07.580
 That, so you do that, you compress people down

1:47:07.580 --> 1:47:09.500
 into these like narrow things.

1:47:09.500 --> 1:47:12.700
 And that's why I think it's kind of ultimately

1:47:12.700 --> 1:47:14.460
 fundamentally incompatible with at least

1:47:14.460 --> 1:47:15.300
 my definition of beauty.

1:47:15.300 --> 1:47:19.020
 It's interesting because there is some sense in which

1:47:21.020 --> 1:47:25.180
 a simplification sort of in the Einstein kind of sense

1:47:25.180 --> 1:47:29.300
 of a really complex idea, a simplification in a way

1:47:29.300 --> 1:47:33.900
 that still captures some core power of an idea of a person

1:47:33.900 --> 1:47:36.100
 is also beautiful.

1:47:36.100 --> 1:47:39.340
 And so maybe it's possible for social media to do that.

1:47:39.340 --> 1:47:44.340
 A presentation, a sort of a slither, a slice,

1:47:44.340 --> 1:47:48.420
 a look into a person's life that reveals something

1:47:48.420 --> 1:47:50.220
 real about them.

1:47:50.220 --> 1:47:52.980
 But in a simple way, in a way that can be displayed

1:47:52.980 --> 1:47:55.340
 graphically or through words.

1:47:55.340 --> 1:47:58.460
 Some way, I mean, in some way Twitter can do

1:47:58.460 --> 1:47:59.700
 that kind of thing.

1:47:59.700 --> 1:48:03.540
 A very few set of words can reveal the intricacies

1:48:03.540 --> 1:48:04.660
 of a person.

1:48:04.660 --> 1:48:09.660
 Of course, the viral machine that spreads those words

1:48:09.660 --> 1:48:14.660
 often results in people taking the thing out of context.

1:48:14.660 --> 1:48:18.900
 People often don't read tweets in the context

1:48:18.900 --> 1:48:20.740
 of the human being that wrote them.

1:48:20.740 --> 1:48:24.060
 The full history of the tweets they've written,

1:48:24.060 --> 1:48:26.540
 the education level, the humor level,

1:48:26.540 --> 1:48:30.380
 the world view they're playing around with,

1:48:30.380 --> 1:48:32.460
 all that context is forgotten and people just see

1:48:32.460 --> 1:48:33.620
 the different words.

1:48:33.620 --> 1:48:35.500
 So that can lead to trouble.

1:48:35.500 --> 1:48:39.780
 But in a certain sense, if you do take it in context,

1:48:39.780 --> 1:48:43.260
 it reveals some kind of quirky little beautiful idea

1:48:43.260 --> 1:48:47.180
 or a profound little idea from that particular person

1:48:47.180 --> 1:48:48.540
 that shows something about that person.

1:48:48.540 --> 1:48:51.260
 So in that sense, Twitter can be more successful

1:48:51.260 --> 1:48:54.060
 if we're talking about Mollux is driving

1:48:54.060 --> 1:48:56.060
 a better kind of incentive.

1:48:56.940 --> 1:49:01.940
 Yeah, I mean, how they can, like if we were to rewrite,

1:49:01.980 --> 1:49:05.420
 is there a way to rewrite the Twitter algorithm

1:49:05.420 --> 1:49:10.420
 so that it stops being the fertile breeding ground

1:49:11.620 --> 1:49:12.460
 of the culture wars?

1:49:12.460 --> 1:49:14.260
 Because that's really what it is.

1:49:15.300 --> 1:49:19.340
 I mean, maybe I'm giving it, Twitter too much power,

1:49:19.340 --> 1:49:21.780
 but just the more I looked into it

1:49:21.780 --> 1:49:25.620
 and I had conversations with Tristan Harris

1:49:25.620 --> 1:49:27.620
 from Center of Humane Technology.

1:49:27.620 --> 1:49:29.100
 And he explained it as like,

1:49:30.820 --> 1:49:34.100
 Twitter is where you have this amalgam of human culture

1:49:34.100 --> 1:49:36.180
 and then this terribly designed algorithm

1:49:36.180 --> 1:49:38.420
 that amplifies the craziest people

1:49:39.780 --> 1:49:44.780
 and the angriest most divisive takes and amplifies them.

1:49:45.500 --> 1:49:47.740
 And then the media, the mainstream media,

1:49:47.740 --> 1:49:49.860
 because all the journalists are also on Twitter,

1:49:49.860 --> 1:49:52.860
 they then are informed by that.

1:49:52.860 --> 1:49:55.060
 And so they draw out the stories they can

1:49:55.060 --> 1:49:59.060
 from this already like very boiling lava of rage

1:50:00.700 --> 1:50:03.340
 and then spread that to their millions

1:50:03.340 --> 1:50:05.740
 and millions of people who aren't even on Twitter.

1:50:07.020 --> 1:50:10.820
 And so I honestly, I think if I could press a button,

1:50:10.820 --> 1:50:13.580
 turn them off, I probably would at this point,

1:50:13.580 --> 1:50:14.740
 because I just don't see a way

1:50:14.740 --> 1:50:17.300
 of being compatible with healthiness,

1:50:17.300 --> 1:50:18.660
 but that's not gonna happen.

1:50:19.580 --> 1:50:23.140
 And so at least one way to like stem the tide

1:50:23.140 --> 1:50:25.660
 and make it less malachy would be to change,

1:50:29.980 --> 1:50:31.900
 at least if like it was on a subscription model,

1:50:31.900 --> 1:50:36.900
 then it's now not optimizing for impressions.

1:50:36.980 --> 1:50:38.300
 Cause basically what it wants is for people

1:50:38.300 --> 1:50:40.180
 to keep coming back as often as possible.

1:50:40.180 --> 1:50:42.020
 That's how they get paid, right?

1:50:42.020 --> 1:50:43.740
 Every time an ad gets shown to someone

1:50:43.740 --> 1:50:46.460
 and the way is to get people constantly refreshing their feed.

1:50:46.460 --> 1:50:49.380
 So you're trying to encourage addictive behaviors.

1:50:49.380 --> 1:50:52.300
 Whereas if someone, if they moved on

1:50:52.300 --> 1:50:53.900
 to at least a subscription model,

1:50:53.900 --> 1:50:56.940
 then they're getting the money either way,

1:50:56.940 --> 1:50:59.140
 whether someone comes back to the site once a month

1:50:59.140 --> 1:51:01.020
 or 500 times a month,

1:51:01.020 --> 1:51:02.060
 they get the same amount of money.

1:51:02.060 --> 1:51:04.860
 So now that takes away that incentive,

1:51:04.860 --> 1:51:07.220
 to use technology, to build,

1:51:07.220 --> 1:51:10.500
 to design an algorithm that is maximally addictive.

1:51:10.500 --> 1:51:12.500
 That would be one way, for example.

1:51:12.500 --> 1:51:14.620
 Yeah, but you still want people to,

1:51:14.620 --> 1:51:17.260
 yeah, I just feel like that just slows down,

1:51:17.260 --> 1:51:20.940
 creates friction in the virality of things.

1:51:20.940 --> 1:51:22.260
 But that's good.

1:51:22.260 --> 1:51:24.420
 We need to slow down virality.

1:51:24.420 --> 1:51:26.580
 It's good, it's one way.

1:51:26.580 --> 1:51:28.900
 Virality is malach, to be clear.

1:51:28.900 --> 1:51:33.900
 So malach is always negative then?

1:51:34.300 --> 1:51:36.500
 Yes, by definition.

1:51:36.500 --> 1:51:37.340
 Yes.

1:51:37.340 --> 1:51:39.460
 Competition is not always negative.

1:51:39.460 --> 1:51:40.540
 Competition is neutral.

1:51:40.540 --> 1:51:44.180
 I disagree with you that all virality is negative then,

1:51:44.180 --> 1:51:45.940
 is malach then.

1:51:45.940 --> 1:51:49.500
 Because it's a good intuition,

1:51:49.500 --> 1:51:52.900
 because we have a lot of data on virality being negative.

1:51:52.900 --> 1:51:57.100
 But I happen to believe that the core of human beings,

1:51:57.100 --> 1:52:00.380
 so most human beings want to be good

1:52:00.380 --> 1:52:03.340
 more than they want to be bad to each other.

1:52:03.340 --> 1:52:05.700
 And so I think it's possible,

1:52:05.700 --> 1:52:09.060
 it might be just harder to engineer systems

1:52:09.060 --> 1:52:10.540
 that enable virality,

1:52:10.540 --> 1:52:13.860
 but it's possible to engineer systems that are viral

1:52:13.860 --> 1:52:15.700
 that enable virality.

1:52:15.700 --> 1:52:19.140
 And the kind of stuff that rises to the top

1:52:19.140 --> 1:52:21.260
 is things that are positive.

1:52:21.260 --> 1:52:24.180
 And positive, not like la la positive,

1:52:24.180 --> 1:52:25.820
 it's more like win win,

1:52:25.820 --> 1:52:28.380
 meaning a lot of people need to be challenged.

1:52:28.380 --> 1:52:29.620
 Wise things, yes.

1:52:29.620 --> 1:52:31.460
 You grow from it, it might challenge you,

1:52:31.460 --> 1:52:34.740
 you might not like it, but you ultimately grow from it.

1:52:34.740 --> 1:52:36.700
 And ultimately bring people together

1:52:36.700 --> 1:52:38.460
 as opposed to tear them apart.

1:52:38.460 --> 1:52:40.540
 I deeply want that to be true.

1:52:40.540 --> 1:52:43.740
 And I very much agree with you that people at their core

1:52:43.740 --> 1:52:46.140
 are on average good, care for each other,

1:52:46.140 --> 1:52:46.980
 as opposed to not.

1:52:46.980 --> 1:52:50.540
 Like I think it's actually a very small percentage

1:52:50.540 --> 1:52:52.900
 of people are truly wanting to do

1:52:52.900 --> 1:52:54.420
 just like destructive malicious things.

1:52:54.420 --> 1:52:56.500
 Most people are just trying to win their own little game.

1:52:56.500 --> 1:52:57.900
 And they don't mean to be,

1:52:57.900 --> 1:53:00.300
 they're just stuck in this badly designed system.

1:53:01.980 --> 1:53:04.620
 That said, the current structure, yes,

1:53:04.620 --> 1:53:09.140
 is the current structure means that virality

1:53:09.140 --> 1:53:10.780
 is optimized towards Moloch.

1:53:10.780 --> 1:53:12.380
 That doesn't mean there aren't exceptions.

1:53:12.380 --> 1:53:14.060
 Sometimes positive stories do go viral

1:53:14.060 --> 1:53:15.140
 and I think we should study them.

1:53:15.140 --> 1:53:17.060
 I think there should be a whole field of study

1:53:17.060 --> 1:53:20.340
 into understanding, identifying memes

1:53:20.340 --> 1:53:24.020
 that above a certain threshold of the population

1:53:24.020 --> 1:53:27.340
 agree is a positive, happy, bringing people together meme.

1:53:27.340 --> 1:53:29.860
 The kind of thing that brings families together

1:53:29.860 --> 1:53:31.700
 that would normally argue about cultural stuff

1:53:31.700 --> 1:53:34.820
 at the table, at the dinner table.

1:53:34.820 --> 1:53:37.420
 Identify those memes and figure out what it was,

1:53:37.420 --> 1:53:40.500
 what was the ingredient that made them spread that day.

1:53:41.380 --> 1:53:44.740
 And also like not just like happiness

1:53:44.740 --> 1:53:45.940
 and connection between humans,

1:53:45.940 --> 1:53:49.580
 but connection between humans in other ways

1:53:49.580 --> 1:53:52.700
 that enables like productivity, like cooperation,

1:53:52.700 --> 1:53:56.180
 solving difficult problems and all those kinds of stuff.

1:53:56.180 --> 1:53:59.020
 So it's not just about let's be happy

1:53:59.020 --> 1:54:00.820
 and have a fulfilling lives.

1:54:00.820 --> 1:54:03.260
 It's also like, let's build cool shit.

1:54:03.260 --> 1:54:04.100
 Let's get excited.

1:54:04.100 --> 1:54:05.100
 Which is the spirit of collaboration,

1:54:05.100 --> 1:54:06.700
 which is deeply anti Moloch, right?

1:54:06.700 --> 1:54:09.300
 That's, it's not using competition.

1:54:09.300 --> 1:54:13.140
 It's like, Moloch hates collaboration and coordination

1:54:13.140 --> 1:54:14.580
 and people working together.

1:54:14.580 --> 1:54:18.060
 And that's, again, like the internet started out as that

1:54:18.060 --> 1:54:20.660
 and it could have been that,

1:54:20.660 --> 1:54:23.380
 but because of the way it was sort of structured

1:54:23.380 --> 1:54:26.860
 in terms of, you know, very lofty ideal,

1:54:26.860 --> 1:54:28.980
 they wanted everything to be open source,

1:54:28.980 --> 1:54:30.620
 open source and also free.

1:54:30.620 --> 1:54:32.820
 And, but they needed to find a way to pay the bills anyway,

1:54:32.820 --> 1:54:33.860
 because they were still building this

1:54:33.860 --> 1:54:36.300
 on top of our old economics system.

1:54:36.300 --> 1:54:37.620
 And so the way they did that

1:54:37.620 --> 1:54:40.260
 was through third party advertisement.

1:54:40.260 --> 1:54:42.780
 But that meant that things were very decoupled.

1:54:42.780 --> 1:54:45.620
 You know, you've got this third party interest,

1:54:45.620 --> 1:54:47.460
 which means that you're then like,

1:54:47.460 --> 1:54:48.980
 people having to optimize for that.

1:54:48.980 --> 1:54:51.300
 And that is, you know, the actual consumer

1:54:51.300 --> 1:54:52.980
 is actually the product,

1:54:52.980 --> 1:54:56.940
 not the person you're making the thing for.

1:54:56.940 --> 1:54:59.820
 In the end, you start making the thing for the advertiser.

1:54:59.820 --> 1:55:01.980
 And so that's why it then like breaks down.

1:55:03.660 --> 1:55:08.260
 Yeah, like it's, there's no clean solution to this.

1:55:08.260 --> 1:55:11.140
 And I, it's a really good suggestion by you actually

1:55:11.140 --> 1:55:16.100
 to like figure out how we can optimize virality

1:55:16.100 --> 1:55:19.540
 for positive sum topics.

1:55:19.540 --> 1:55:22.700
 I shall be the general of the love bot army.

1:55:24.900 --> 1:55:26.220
 Distributed.

1:55:26.220 --> 1:55:28.420
 Distributed, distributed, no, okay, yeah.

1:55:28.420 --> 1:55:30.220
 The power, just even in saying that,

1:55:30.220 --> 1:55:32.220
 the power already went to my head.

1:55:32.220 --> 1:55:35.940
 No, okay, you've talked about quantifying your thinking.

1:55:35.940 --> 1:55:36.980
 We've been talking about this,

1:55:36.980 --> 1:55:39.340
 sort of a game theoretic view on life

1:55:39.340 --> 1:55:42.260
 and putting probabilities behind estimates.

1:55:42.260 --> 1:55:44.260
 Like if you think about different trajectories

1:55:44.260 --> 1:55:45.660
 you can take through life,

1:55:45.660 --> 1:55:48.340
 just actually analyzing life in game theoretic way,

1:55:48.340 --> 1:55:50.820
 like your own life, like personal life.

1:55:50.820 --> 1:55:52.820
 I think you've given an example

1:55:52.820 --> 1:55:54.700
 that you had an honest conversation with Igor

1:55:54.700 --> 1:55:57.780
 about like, how long is this relationship gonna last?

1:55:57.780 --> 1:56:00.140
 So similar to our sort of marriage problem

1:56:00.140 --> 1:56:03.180
 kind of discussion, having an honest conversation

1:56:03.180 --> 1:56:05.620
 about the probability of things

1:56:05.620 --> 1:56:08.580
 that we sometimes are a little bit too shy

1:56:08.580 --> 1:56:11.820
 or scared to think of in a probabilistic terms.

1:56:11.820 --> 1:56:15.060
 Can you speak to that kind of way of reasoning,

1:56:15.060 --> 1:56:17.020
 the good and the bad of that?

1:56:17.020 --> 1:56:20.020
 Can you do this kind of thing with human relations?

1:56:20.900 --> 1:56:25.020
 Yeah, so the scenario you're talking about, it was like.

1:56:25.020 --> 1:56:26.020
 Yeah, tell me about that scenario.

1:56:26.020 --> 1:56:29.940
 Yeah, I think it was about a year into our relationship

1:56:30.900 --> 1:56:34.500
 and we were having a fairly heavy conversation

1:56:34.500 --> 1:56:35.460
 because we were trying to figure out

1:56:35.460 --> 1:56:37.580
 whether or not I was gonna sell my apartment.

1:56:37.580 --> 1:56:40.180
 Well, you know, he had already moved in,

1:56:40.180 --> 1:56:41.780
 but I think we were just figuring out

1:56:41.780 --> 1:56:43.660
 what like our longterm plans would be.

1:56:43.660 --> 1:56:46.340
 We should be by a place together, et cetera.

1:56:46.340 --> 1:56:47.700
 When you guys are having that conversation,

1:56:47.700 --> 1:56:49.820
 are you like drunk out of your mind on wine

1:56:49.820 --> 1:56:52.780
 or is he sober and you're actually having a serious?

1:56:52.780 --> 1:56:53.700
 I think we were sober.

1:56:53.700 --> 1:56:54.940
 How do you get to that conversation?

1:56:54.940 --> 1:56:56.180
 Because most people are kind of afraid

1:56:56.180 --> 1:56:58.780
 to have that kind of serious conversation.

1:56:58.780 --> 1:57:01.540
 Well, so our relationship was very,

1:57:01.540 --> 1:57:03.360
 well, first of all, we were good friends

1:57:03.360 --> 1:57:06.800
 for a couple of years before we even got romantic.

1:57:08.340 --> 1:57:12.460
 And when we did get romantic,

1:57:12.460 --> 1:57:15.780
 it was very clear that this was a big deal.

1:57:15.780 --> 1:57:18.840
 It wasn't just like another, it wasn't a random thing.

1:57:20.420 --> 1:57:22.900
 So the probability of it being a big deal was high.

1:57:22.900 --> 1:57:24.220
 It was already very high.

1:57:24.220 --> 1:57:26.220
 And then we'd been together for a year

1:57:26.220 --> 1:57:28.820
 and it had been pretty golden and wonderful.

1:57:28.820 --> 1:57:32.620
 So, you know, there was a lot of foundation already

1:57:32.620 --> 1:57:33.820
 where we felt very comfortable

1:57:33.820 --> 1:57:35.220
 having a lot of frank conversations.

1:57:35.220 --> 1:57:38.460
 But Igor's MO has always been much more than mine.

1:57:38.460 --> 1:57:39.980
 He was always from the outset,

1:57:39.980 --> 1:57:42.600
 like just in a relationship,

1:57:42.600 --> 1:57:45.340
 radical transparency and honesty is the way

1:57:45.340 --> 1:57:47.100
 because the truth is the truth,

1:57:47.100 --> 1:57:48.420
 whether you want to hide it or not, you know,

1:57:48.420 --> 1:57:50.300
 but it will come out eventually.

1:57:50.300 --> 1:57:55.300
 And if you aren't able to accept difficult things yourself,

1:57:56.540 --> 1:57:58.540
 then how could you possibly expect to be like

1:57:58.540 --> 1:58:00.420
 the most integral version that, you know,

1:58:00.420 --> 1:58:02.940
 you can't, the relationship needs this bedrock

1:58:02.940 --> 1:58:06.620
 of like honesty as a foundation more than anything.

1:58:06.620 --> 1:58:07.700
 Yeah, that's really interesting,

1:58:07.700 --> 1:58:09.960
 but I would like to push against some of those ideas,

1:58:09.960 --> 1:58:13.780
 but that's the down the line, yes, throw them up.

1:58:13.780 --> 1:58:15.260
 I just rudely interrupt.

1:58:15.260 --> 1:58:16.780
 That was fine.

1:58:16.780 --> 1:58:19.860
 And so, you know, we'd been about together for a year

1:58:19.860 --> 1:58:20.700
 and things were good

1:58:20.700 --> 1:58:23.460
 and we were having this hard conversation

1:58:23.460 --> 1:58:25.300
 and then he was like, well, okay,

1:58:25.300 --> 1:58:27.300
 what's the likelihood that we're going to be together

1:58:27.300 --> 1:58:28.300
 in three years then?

1:58:28.300 --> 1:58:31.060
 Because I think it was roughly a three year time horizon.

1:58:31.060 --> 1:58:32.900
 And I was like, ooh, ooh, interesting.

1:58:32.900 --> 1:58:34.260
 And then we were like, actually wait,

1:58:34.260 --> 1:58:35.100
 before you said out loud,

1:58:35.100 --> 1:58:37.760
 let's both write down our predictions formally

1:58:37.760 --> 1:58:38.600
 because we'd been like,

1:58:38.600 --> 1:58:40.460
 we're just getting into like effective altruism

1:58:40.460 --> 1:58:41.860
 and rationality at the time,

1:58:41.860 --> 1:58:43.900
 which is all about making formal predictions

1:58:43.900 --> 1:58:47.400
 as a means of measuring your own,

1:58:48.980 --> 1:58:53.700
 well, your own foresight essentially in a quantified way.

1:58:53.700 --> 1:58:55.500
 So we like both wrote down our percentages

1:58:55.500 --> 1:58:58.660
 and we also did a one year prediction

1:58:58.660 --> 1:58:59.600
 and a 10 year one as well.

1:58:59.600 --> 1:59:02.000
 So we got percentages for all three

1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:03.900
 and then we showed each other.

1:59:03.900 --> 1:59:06.260
 And I remember like having this moment of like, ooh,

1:59:06.260 --> 1:59:08.760
 because for the 10 year one, I was like, well, I mean,

1:59:08.760 --> 1:59:09.600
 I love him a lot,

1:59:09.600 --> 1:59:11.800
 but like a lot can happen in 10 years,

1:59:11.800 --> 1:59:14.260
 and we've only been together for,

1:59:14.260 --> 1:59:16.220
 so I was like, I think it's over 50%,

1:59:16.220 --> 1:59:17.900
 but it's definitely not 90%.

1:59:17.900 --> 1:59:19.020
 And I remember like wrestling,

1:59:19.020 --> 1:59:20.220
 I was like, oh, but I don't want him to be hurt.

1:59:20.220 --> 1:59:21.400
 I don't want him to,

1:59:21.400 --> 1:59:22.700
 I don't want to give a number lower than his.

1:59:22.700 --> 1:59:25.260
 And I remember thinking, I was like, ah, ah, don't game it.

1:59:25.260 --> 1:59:28.100
 This is an exercise in radical honesty.

1:59:28.100 --> 1:59:29.500
 So just give your real percentage.

1:59:29.500 --> 1:59:31.300
 And I think mine was like 75%.

1:59:31.300 --> 1:59:32.400
 And then we showed each other

1:59:32.400 --> 1:59:34.900
 and luckily we were fairly well aligned.

1:59:34.900 --> 1:59:38.640
 And, but honestly, even if we weren't.

1:59:38.640 --> 1:59:39.480
 20%.

1:59:39.480 --> 1:59:40.320
 Huh?

1:59:40.320 --> 1:59:41.940
 It definitely would have,

1:59:41.940 --> 1:59:45.540
 I, if his had been consistently lower than mine,

1:59:45.540 --> 1:59:48.140
 that would have rattled me for sure.

1:59:48.140 --> 1:59:49.920
 Whereas if it had been the other way around,

1:59:49.920 --> 1:59:50.740
 I think he would have,

1:59:50.740 --> 1:59:53.000
 he's just kind of like a water off a duck's back type of guy.

1:59:53.000 --> 1:59:55.240
 It'd be like, okay, well, all right, we'll figure this out.

1:59:55.240 --> 1:59:57.880
 Well, did you guys provide error bars on the estimate?

1:59:57.880 --> 1:59:58.760
 Like the level of uncertainty?

1:59:58.760 --> 1:59:59.600
 They came built in.

1:59:59.600 --> 2:00:02.220
 We didn't give formal plus or minus error bars.

2:00:02.220 --> 2:00:03.560
 I didn't draw any or anything like that.

2:00:03.560 --> 2:00:05.680
 Well, I guess that's the question I have is,

2:00:05.680 --> 2:00:10.680
 did you feel informed enough to make such decisions?

2:00:12.320 --> 2:00:13.920
 Cause like, I feel like if you were,

2:00:13.920 --> 2:00:16.160
 if I were to do this kind of thing rigorously,

2:00:17.360 --> 2:00:19.060
 I would want some data.

2:00:20.520 --> 2:00:23.080
 I would want to set one of the assumptions you have

2:00:23.080 --> 2:00:25.360
 is you're not that different from other relationships.

2:00:25.360 --> 2:00:26.200
 Right.

2:00:26.200 --> 2:00:29.360
 And so I want to have some data about the way.

2:00:29.360 --> 2:00:30.680
 You want the base rates.

2:00:30.680 --> 2:00:34.400
 Yeah, and also actual trajectories of relationships.

2:00:34.400 --> 2:00:39.080
 I would love to have like time series data

2:00:39.080 --> 2:00:42.840
 about the ways that relationships fall apart or prosper,

2:00:43.720 --> 2:00:46.700
 how they collide with different life events,

2:00:46.700 --> 2:00:48.840
 losses, job changes, moving.

2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:54.520
 Both partners find jobs, only one has a job.

2:00:54.520 --> 2:00:56.320
 I want that kind of data

2:00:56.320 --> 2:00:58.960
 and how often the different trajectories change in life.

2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:03.960
 Like how informative is your past to your future?

2:01:04.400 --> 2:01:05.240
 That's the whole thing.

2:01:05.240 --> 2:01:09.800
 Like can you look at my life and have a good prediction

2:01:09.800 --> 2:01:13.560
 about in terms of my characteristics and my relationships,

2:01:13.560 --> 2:01:15.880
 what that's going to look like in the future or not?

2:01:15.880 --> 2:01:17.200
 I don't even know the answer to that question.

2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:20.740
 I'll be very ill informed in terms of making the probability.

2:01:20.740 --> 2:01:25.680
 I would be far, yeah, I just would be under informed.

2:01:25.680 --> 2:01:26.680
 I would be under informed.

2:01:26.680 --> 2:01:31.240
 I'll be over biasing to my prior experiences, I think.

2:01:31.240 --> 2:01:33.120
 Right, but as long as you're aware of that

2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:34.480
 and you're honest with yourself,

2:01:34.480 --> 2:01:35.760
 and you're honest with the other person,

2:01:35.760 --> 2:01:37.640
 say, look, I have really wide error bars on this

2:01:37.640 --> 2:01:40.440
 for the following reasons, that's okay.

2:01:40.440 --> 2:01:42.040
 I still think it's better than not trying

2:01:42.040 --> 2:01:43.200
 to quantify it at all.

2:01:43.200 --> 2:01:45.220
 If you're trying to make really major

2:01:45.220 --> 2:01:46.760
 irreversible life decisions.

2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:49.480
 And I feel also the romantic nature of that question

2:01:49.480 --> 2:01:52.800
 for me personally, I try to live my life

2:01:52.800 --> 2:01:55.440
 thinking it's very close to 100%.

2:01:55.440 --> 2:01:58.400
 Like, allowing myself actually the,

2:01:58.400 --> 2:02:01.280
 this is the difficulty of this is allowing myself

2:02:01.280 --> 2:02:04.520
 to think differently, I feel like has

2:02:04.520 --> 2:02:06.460
 a psychological consequence.

2:02:06.460 --> 2:02:08.400
 That's where that, that's one of my pushbacks

2:02:08.400 --> 2:02:13.400
 against radical honesty is this one particular perspective.

2:02:14.480 --> 2:02:16.240
 So you're saying you would rather give

2:02:16.240 --> 2:02:20.140
 a falsely high percentage to your partner.

2:02:20.140 --> 2:02:21.840
 Going back to the wide sage filth.

2:02:21.840 --> 2:02:24.560
 In order to sort of create this additional optimism.

2:02:24.560 --> 2:02:25.520
 Helmuth.

2:02:25.520 --> 2:02:26.360
 Yes.

2:02:26.360 --> 2:02:29.360
 Of fake it till you make it.

2:02:29.360 --> 2:02:31.200
 The positive, the power of positive thinking.

2:02:31.200 --> 2:02:32.040
 Hashtag positivity.

2:02:32.040 --> 2:02:35.320
 Yeah, hashtag, it's with a hashtag.

2:02:35.320 --> 2:02:37.440
 Well, so that, and this comes back to this idea

2:02:37.440 --> 2:02:39.760
 of useful fictions, right?

2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:42.920
 And I agree, I don't think there's a clear answer to this.

2:02:42.920 --> 2:02:44.240
 And I think it's actually quite subjective.

2:02:44.240 --> 2:02:46.560
 Some people this works better for than others.

2:02:48.320 --> 2:02:50.120
 You know, to be clear, Igor and I weren't doing

2:02:50.120 --> 2:02:51.960
 this formal prediction in it.

2:02:51.960 --> 2:02:55.520
 Like we did it with very much tongue in cheek.

2:02:55.520 --> 2:02:57.380
 It wasn't like we were going to make,

2:02:57.380 --> 2:03:00.160
 I don't think it even would have drastically changed

2:03:00.160 --> 2:03:02.160
 what we decided to do even.

2:03:02.160 --> 2:03:05.200
 We kind of just did it more as a fun exercise.

2:03:05.200 --> 2:03:06.840
 For the consequence of that fun exercise,

2:03:06.840 --> 2:03:09.920
 you really actually kind of, there was a deep honesty to it.

2:03:09.920 --> 2:03:11.720
 Exactly, it was a deep, and it was, yeah,

2:03:11.720 --> 2:03:13.240
 it was just like this moment of reflection.

2:03:13.240 --> 2:03:14.680
 I'm like, oh wow, I actually have to think

2:03:14.680 --> 2:03:17.840
 like through this quite critically and so on.

2:03:17.840 --> 2:03:22.840
 And it's also what was interesting was I got to like check

2:03:22.840 --> 2:03:25.960
 in with what my desires were.

2:03:25.960 --> 2:03:28.560
 So there was one thing of like what my actual prediction is,

2:03:28.560 --> 2:03:30.400
 but what are my desires and could these desires

2:03:30.400 --> 2:03:32.440
 be affecting my predictions and so on.

2:03:32.440 --> 2:03:34.920
 And you know, that's a method of rationality.

2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:37.080
 And I personally don't think it loses anything in terms of,

2:03:37.080 --> 2:03:38.440
 I didn't take any of the magic away

2:03:38.440 --> 2:03:39.920
 from our relationship, quite the opposite.

2:03:39.920 --> 2:03:42.600
 Like it brought us closer together because it was like,

2:03:42.600 --> 2:03:45.360
 we did this weird fun thing that I appreciate

2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:47.800
 a lot of people find quite strange.

2:03:47.800 --> 2:03:51.800
 And I think it was somewhat unique in our relationship

2:03:51.800 --> 2:03:54.840
 that both of us are very, we both love numbers,

2:03:54.840 --> 2:03:58.320
 we both love statistics, we're both poker players.

2:03:58.320 --> 2:04:01.240
 So this was kind of like our safe space anyway.

2:04:01.240 --> 2:04:04.640
 For others, one partner really might not

2:04:04.640 --> 2:04:06.360
 like that kind of stuff at all, in which case

2:04:06.360 --> 2:04:07.840
 this is not a good exercise to do.

2:04:07.840 --> 2:04:10.600
 I don't recommend it to everybody.

2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:14.280
 But I do think there's, it's interesting sometimes

2:04:14.280 --> 2:04:18.920
 to poke holes in the probe at these things

2:04:18.920 --> 2:04:21.600
 that we consider so sacred that we can't try

2:04:21.600 --> 2:04:24.720
 to quantify them, which is interesting

2:04:24.720 --> 2:04:26.120
 because that's in tension with like the idea

2:04:26.120 --> 2:04:27.440
 of what we just talked about with beauty

2:04:27.440 --> 2:04:28.720
 and like what makes something beautiful,

2:04:28.720 --> 2:04:31.000
 the fact that you can't measure everything about it.

2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:32.960
 And perhaps something shouldn't be tried to measure,

2:04:32.960 --> 2:04:36.400
 maybe it's wrong to completely try and value

2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:39.200
 the utilitarian, put a utilitarian frame

2:04:39.200 --> 2:04:43.320
 of measuring the utility of a tree in its entirety.

2:04:43.320 --> 2:04:44.760
 I don't know, maybe we should, maybe we shouldn't.

2:04:44.760 --> 2:04:46.680
 I'm ambivalent on that.

2:04:46.680 --> 2:04:51.680
 But overall, people have too many biases.

2:04:52.680 --> 2:04:57.080
 People are overly biased against trying to do

2:04:57.080 --> 2:04:59.880
 like a quantified cost benefit analysis

2:04:59.880 --> 2:05:01.560
 on really tough life decisions.

2:05:02.680 --> 2:05:04.000
 They're like, oh, just go with your gut.

2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:07.200
 It's like, well, sure, but guts, our intuitions

2:05:07.200 --> 2:05:09.160
 are best suited for things that we've got tons

2:05:09.160 --> 2:05:11.920
 of experience in, then we can really, you don't trust on it.

2:05:11.920 --> 2:05:13.360
 If it's a decision we've made many times,

2:05:13.360 --> 2:05:16.040
 but if it's like, should I marry this person

2:05:16.040 --> 2:05:19.040
 or should I buy this house over that house?

2:05:19.040 --> 2:05:20.700
 You only make those decisions a couple of times

2:05:20.700 --> 2:05:23.000
 in your life, maybe.

2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:26.940
 Well, I would love to know, there's a balance,

2:05:26.940 --> 2:05:29.240
 probably is a personal balance to strike

2:05:29.240 --> 2:05:33.140
 is the amount of rationality you apply

2:05:33.140 --> 2:05:38.140
 to a question versus the useful fiction,

2:05:38.160 --> 2:05:40.120
 the fake it till you make it.

2:05:40.120 --> 2:05:43.560
 For example, just talking to soldiers in Ukraine,

2:05:43.560 --> 2:05:48.560
 you ask them, what's the probability of you winning,

2:05:49.220 --> 2:05:50.220
 Ukraine winning?

2:05:52.480 --> 2:05:55.680
 Almost everybody I talk to is 100%.

2:05:55.680 --> 2:05:56.880
 Wow.

2:05:56.880 --> 2:05:59.000
 And you listen to the experts, right?

2:05:59.000 --> 2:06:00.800
 They say all kinds of stuff.

2:06:00.800 --> 2:06:01.640
 Right.

2:06:01.640 --> 2:06:05.360
 They are, first of all, the morale there

2:06:05.360 --> 2:06:07.200
 is higher than probably enough.

2:06:07.200 --> 2:06:09.920
 I've never been to a war zone before this,

2:06:09.920 --> 2:06:12.560
 but I've read about many wars

2:06:12.560 --> 2:06:14.920
 and I think the morale in Ukraine is higher

2:06:14.920 --> 2:06:17.320
 than almost any war I've read about.

2:06:17.320 --> 2:06:19.360
 It's every single person in the country

2:06:19.360 --> 2:06:21.720
 is proud to fight for their country.

2:06:21.720 --> 2:06:22.560
 Wow.

2:06:22.560 --> 2:06:25.640
 Everybody, not just soldiers, not everybody.

2:06:25.640 --> 2:06:26.560
 Why do you think that is?

2:06:26.560 --> 2:06:28.660
 Specifically more than in other wars?

2:06:31.920 --> 2:06:36.680
 I think because there's perhaps a dormant desire

2:06:36.680 --> 2:06:40.520
 for the citizens of this country to find

2:06:40.520 --> 2:06:43.280
 the identity of this country because it's been

2:06:43.280 --> 2:06:45.340
 going through this 30 year process

2:06:45.340 --> 2:06:48.400
 of different factions and political bickering

2:06:48.400 --> 2:06:50.960
 and they haven't had, as they talk about,

2:06:50.960 --> 2:06:52.600
 they haven't had their independence war.

2:06:52.600 --> 2:06:55.880
 They say all great nations have had an independence war.

2:06:55.880 --> 2:06:58.920
 They had to fight for their independence,

2:06:58.920 --> 2:07:01.320
 for the discovery of the identity of the core

2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:04.600
 of the ideals that unify us and they haven't had that.

2:07:04.600 --> 2:07:07.220
 There's constantly been factions, there's been divisions,

2:07:07.220 --> 2:07:09.820
 there's been pressures from empires,

2:07:09.820 --> 2:07:12.320
 from the United States and from Russia,

2:07:12.320 --> 2:07:15.680
 from NATO and Europe, everybody telling them what to do.

2:07:15.680 --> 2:07:17.600
 Now they want to discover who they are

2:07:17.600 --> 2:07:21.240
 and there's that kind of sense that we're going to fight

2:07:21.240 --> 2:07:23.280
 for the safety of our homeland,

2:07:23.280 --> 2:07:25.640
 but we're also gonna fight for our identity.

2:07:25.640 --> 2:07:30.640
 And that, on top of the fact that there's just,

2:07:32.040 --> 2:07:33.960
 if you look at the history of Ukraine

2:07:33.960 --> 2:07:36.760
 and there's certain other countries like this,

2:07:36.760 --> 2:07:39.880
 there are certain cultures that are feisty

2:07:39.880 --> 2:07:44.880
 in their pride of being the citizens of that nation.

2:07:45.680 --> 2:07:48.400
 Ukraine is that, Poland was that.

2:07:48.400 --> 2:07:49.480
 You just look at history.

2:07:49.480 --> 2:07:52.800
 In certain countries, you do not want to occupy.

2:07:54.240 --> 2:07:56.880
 I mean, both Stalin and Hitler talked about Poland

2:07:56.880 --> 2:08:00.260
 in this way, they're like, this is a big problem

2:08:00.260 --> 2:08:02.360
 if we occupy this land for prolonged periods of time.

2:08:02.360 --> 2:08:04.680
 They're gonna be a pain in their ass.

2:08:04.680 --> 2:08:07.120
 They're not going to want to be occupied.

2:08:07.120 --> 2:08:09.520
 And certain other countries are pragmatic.

2:08:09.520 --> 2:08:12.200
 They're like, well, leaders come and go.

2:08:12.200 --> 2:08:13.200
 I guess this is good.

2:08:14.400 --> 2:08:16.520
 Ukraine just doesn't have, Ukrainians,

2:08:18.200 --> 2:08:19.280
 throughout the 20th century,

2:08:19.280 --> 2:08:20.760
 don't seem to be the kind of people

2:08:20.760 --> 2:08:25.760
 that just sit calmly and let the quote unquote occupiers

2:08:28.200 --> 2:08:30.160
 impose their rules.

2:08:30.160 --> 2:08:32.400
 That's interesting though, because you said it's always been

2:08:32.400 --> 2:08:35.520
 under conflict and leaders have come and gone.

2:08:35.520 --> 2:08:37.120
 So you would expect them to actually be the opposite

2:08:37.120 --> 2:08:39.160
 under that like reasoning.

2:08:39.160 --> 2:08:42.360
 Well, because it's a very fertile land,

2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:43.480
 it's great for agriculture.

2:08:43.480 --> 2:08:44.800
 So a lot of people want to,

2:08:44.800 --> 2:08:46.520
 I mean, I think they've developed this culture

2:08:46.520 --> 2:08:47.920
 because they've constantly been occupied

2:08:47.920 --> 2:08:51.040
 by different people for the different peoples.

2:08:51.040 --> 2:08:54.600
 And so maybe there is something to that

2:08:54.600 --> 2:08:59.600
 where you've constantly had to feel like within the blood

2:08:59.600 --> 2:09:04.600
 of the generations, there's the struggle against the man,

2:09:04.840 --> 2:09:08.600
 against the imposition of rules, against oppression

2:09:08.600 --> 2:09:10.560
 and all that kind of stuff, and that stays with them.

2:09:10.560 --> 2:09:15.320
 So there's a will there, but a lot of other aspects

2:09:15.320 --> 2:09:18.000
 are also part of it that has to do with

2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:20.000
 the reverse Mollet kind of situation

2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:23.120
 where social media has definitely played a part of it.

2:09:23.120 --> 2:09:25.040
 Also different charismatic individuals

2:09:25.040 --> 2:09:27.160
 have had to play a part.

2:09:27.160 --> 2:09:31.120
 The fact that the president of the nation, Zelensky,

2:09:31.120 --> 2:09:35.160
 stayed in Kiev during the invasion

2:09:36.280 --> 2:09:37.680
 is a huge inspiration to them

2:09:37.680 --> 2:09:41.440
 because most leaders, as you can imagine,

2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:44.520
 when the capital of the nation is under attack,

2:09:44.520 --> 2:09:46.800
 the wise thing, the smart thing

2:09:46.800 --> 2:09:49.080
 that the United States advised Zelensky to do

2:09:49.080 --> 2:09:52.720
 is to flee and to be the leader of the nation

2:09:52.720 --> 2:09:54.720
 from a distant place.

2:09:54.720 --> 2:09:57.160
 He said, fuck that, I'm staying put.

2:09:58.840 --> 2:10:01.720
 Everyone around him, there was a pressure to leave

2:10:01.720 --> 2:10:06.480
 and he didn't, and those singular acts

2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:09.160
 really can unify a nation.

2:10:09.160 --> 2:10:11.360
 There's a lot of people that criticize Zelensky

2:10:11.360 --> 2:10:12.720
 within Ukraine.

2:10:12.720 --> 2:10:17.200
 Before the war, he was very unpopular, even still,

2:10:17.200 --> 2:10:22.080
 but they put that aside, especially that singular act

2:10:22.080 --> 2:10:24.080
 of staying in the capital.

2:10:24.080 --> 2:10:27.760
 Yeah, a lot of those kinds of things come together

2:10:27.760 --> 2:10:31.600
 to create something within people.

2:10:33.360 --> 2:10:35.840
 These things always, of course, though,

2:10:39.920 --> 2:10:42.520
 how zoomed out of a view do you wanna take?

2:10:43.600 --> 2:10:45.000
 Because, yeah, you describe it,

2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:47.960
 it's like an anti Moloch thing happened within Ukraine

2:10:47.960 --> 2:10:49.760
 because it brought the Ukrainian people together

2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:51.760
 in order to fight a common enemy.

2:10:51.760 --> 2:10:53.360
 Maybe that's a good thing, maybe that's a bad thing.

2:10:53.360 --> 2:10:54.200
 In the end, we don't know

2:10:54.200 --> 2:10:56.720
 how this is all gonna play out, right?

2:10:56.720 --> 2:11:01.120
 But if you zoom it out from a level, on a global level,

2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:05.120
 they're coming together to fight that,

2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:12.240
 that could make a conflict larger.

2:11:12.240 --> 2:11:13.120
 You know what I mean?

2:11:13.120 --> 2:11:15.680
 I don't know what the right answer is here.

2:11:15.680 --> 2:11:17.600
 It seems like a good thing that they came together,

2:11:17.600 --> 2:11:20.000
 but we don't know how this is all gonna play out.

2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:21.920
 If this all turns into nuclear war, we'll be like,

2:11:21.920 --> 2:11:23.440
 okay, that was the bad, that was the...

2:11:23.440 --> 2:11:26.080
 Oh yeah, so I was describing the reverse Moloch

2:11:26.080 --> 2:11:27.440
 for the local level.

2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:28.280
 Exactly, yes.

2:11:28.280 --> 2:11:32.160
 Now, this is where the experts come in and they say,

2:11:32.160 --> 2:11:37.160
 well, if you channel most of the resources of the nation

2:11:37.520 --> 2:11:42.520
 and the nations supporting Ukraine into the war effort,

2:11:42.760 --> 2:11:45.800
 are you not beating the drums of war

2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:47.480
 that is much bigger than Ukraine?

2:11:47.480 --> 2:11:50.880
 In fact, even the Ukrainian leaders

2:11:50.880 --> 2:11:52.920
 are speaking of it this way.

2:11:52.920 --> 2:11:55.840
 This is not a war between two nations.

2:11:55.840 --> 2:12:00.840
 This is the early days of a world war,

2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:02.440
 if we don't play this correctly.

2:12:02.440 --> 2:12:07.440
 Yes, and we need cool heads from our leaders.

2:12:07.760 --> 2:12:10.200
 So from Ukraine's perspective,

2:12:10.200 --> 2:12:12.640
 Ukraine needs to win the war

2:12:12.640 --> 2:12:15.440
 because what does winning the war mean

2:12:15.440 --> 2:12:20.440
 is coming to peace negotiations, an agreement

2:12:21.600 --> 2:12:24.360
 that guarantees no more invasions.

2:12:24.360 --> 2:12:25.640
 And then you make an agreement

2:12:25.640 --> 2:12:28.560
 about what land belongs to who.

2:12:28.560 --> 2:12:30.240
 And that's, you stop that.

2:12:30.240 --> 2:12:34.120
 And basically from their perspective

2:12:34.120 --> 2:12:36.600
 is you want to demonstrate to the rest of the world

2:12:36.600 --> 2:12:39.640
 who's watching carefully, including Russia and China

2:12:39.640 --> 2:12:42.280
 and different players on the geopolitical stage,

2:12:42.280 --> 2:12:46.000
 that this kind of conflict is not going to be productive

2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:47.240
 if you engage in it.

2:12:47.240 --> 2:12:49.240
 So you want to teach everybody a lesson,

2:12:49.240 --> 2:12:50.920
 let's not do World War III.

2:12:50.920 --> 2:12:53.000
 It's gonna be bad for everybody.

2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:54.760
 And so it's a lose, lose.

2:12:54.760 --> 2:12:56.600
 It's a deep lose, lose.

2:12:56.600 --> 2:12:57.440
 Doesn't matter.

2:13:00.400 --> 2:13:04.160
 And I think that's actually a correct,

2:13:05.680 --> 2:13:10.160
 when I zoom out, I mean, 99% of what I think about

2:13:10.160 --> 2:13:12.320
 is just individual human beings and human lives

2:13:12.320 --> 2:13:14.600
 and just that war is horrible.

2:13:14.600 --> 2:13:15.920
 But when you zoom out and think

2:13:15.920 --> 2:13:17.760
 from a geopolitics perspective,

2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:22.000
 we should realize that it's entirely possible

2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:26.400
 that we will see a World War III in the 21st century.

2:13:26.400 --> 2:13:29.840
 And this is like a dress rehearsal for that.

2:13:29.840 --> 2:13:34.840
 And so the way we play this as a human civilization

2:13:34.840 --> 2:13:39.840
 will define whether we do or don't have a World War III.

2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:49.320
 How we discuss war, how we discuss nuclear war,

2:13:49.320 --> 2:13:54.320
 the kind of leaders we elect and prop up,

2:13:55.200 --> 2:13:58.480
 the kind of memes we circulate,

2:13:58.480 --> 2:13:59.920
 because you have to be very careful

2:13:59.920 --> 2:14:04.480
 when you're being pro Ukraine, for example,

2:14:04.480 --> 2:14:06.440
 you have to realize that you're being,

2:14:07.640 --> 2:14:11.520
 you are also indirectly feeding

2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:14.640
 the ever increasing military industrial complex.

2:14:15.560 --> 2:14:17.560
 So you have to be extremely careful

2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:22.560
 that when you say pro Ukraine or pro anybody,

2:14:24.440 --> 2:14:29.440
 you're pro human beings, not pro the machine

2:14:29.440 --> 2:14:34.440
 that creates narratives that says it's pro human beings.

2:14:36.760 --> 2:14:39.920
 But it's actually, if you look at the raw use

2:14:39.920 --> 2:14:44.840
 of funds and resources, it's actually pro making weapons

2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:47.360
 and shooting bullets and dropping bombs.

2:14:47.360 --> 2:14:50.600
 The real, we have to just somehow get the meme

2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:54.560
 into everyone's heads that the real enemy is war itself.

2:14:54.560 --> 2:14:57.040
 That's the enemy we need to defeat.

2:14:57.040 --> 2:15:01.560
 And that doesn't mean to say that there isn't justification

2:15:01.560 --> 2:15:06.560
 for small local scenarios, adversarial conflicts.

2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:11.080
 If you have a leader who is starting wars,

2:15:11.080 --> 2:15:13.720
 they're on the side of team war, basically.

2:15:13.720 --> 2:15:15.240
 It's not that they're on the side of team country,

2:15:15.240 --> 2:15:16.200
 whatever that country is,

2:15:16.200 --> 2:15:17.920
 it's they're on the side of team war.

2:15:17.920 --> 2:15:20.160
 So that needs to be stopped and put down.

2:15:20.160 --> 2:15:21.560
 But you also have to find a way

2:15:21.560 --> 2:15:25.480
 that your corrective measure doesn't actually then

2:15:25.480 --> 2:15:27.360
 end up being coopted by the war machine

2:15:27.360 --> 2:15:28.920
 and creating greater war.

2:15:28.920 --> 2:15:31.080
 Again, the playing field is finite.

2:15:31.080 --> 2:15:35.200
 The scale of conflict is now getting so big

2:15:35.200 --> 2:15:38.840
 that the weapons that can be used are so mass destructive

2:15:40.280 --> 2:15:42.560
 that we can't afford another giant conflict.

2:15:42.560 --> 2:15:44.080
 We just, we won't make it.

2:15:44.080 --> 2:15:48.000
 What existential threat in terms of us not making it

2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:49.640
 are you most worried about?

2:15:49.640 --> 2:15:51.920
 What existential threat to human civilization?

2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:52.760
 We got like, let's go.

2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:53.600
 Going down a dark path, huh?

2:15:53.600 --> 2:15:56.600
 It's good, but no, well, no, it's a dark.

2:15:56.600 --> 2:15:58.560
 No, it's like, well, while we're in the somber place,

2:15:58.560 --> 2:15:59.400
 we might as well.

2:16:02.280 --> 2:16:04.480
 Some of my best friends are dark paths.

2:16:06.680 --> 2:16:07.960
 What worries you most?

2:16:07.960 --> 2:16:12.960
 We mentioned asteroids, we mentioned AGI, nuclear weapons.

2:16:14.160 --> 2:16:17.320
 The one that's on my mind the most,

2:16:17.320 --> 2:16:19.400
 mostly because I think it's the one where we have

2:16:19.400 --> 2:16:21.920
 actually a real chance to move the needle on

2:16:21.920 --> 2:16:24.520
 in a positive direction or more specifically,

2:16:24.520 --> 2:16:26.800
 stop some really bad things from happening,

2:16:26.800 --> 2:16:31.800
 really dumb, avoidable things is bio risks.

2:16:36.160 --> 2:16:37.480
 In what kind of bio risks?

2:16:37.480 --> 2:16:39.320
 There's so many fun options.

2:16:39.320 --> 2:16:41.880
 So many, so of course, we have natural risks

2:16:41.880 --> 2:16:45.000
 from natural pandemics, naturally occurring viruses

2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:49.560
 or pathogens, and then also as time and technology goes on

2:16:49.560 --> 2:16:51.520
 and technology becomes more and more democratized

2:16:51.520 --> 2:16:54.000
 and into the hands of more and more people,

2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:55.920
 the risk of synthetic pathogens.

2:16:57.320 --> 2:17:00.600
 And whether or not you fall into the camp of COVID

2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:03.680
 was gain of function accidental lab leak

2:17:03.680 --> 2:17:05.880
 or whether it was purely naturally occurring,

2:17:07.200 --> 2:17:12.200
 either way, we are facing a future where synthetic pathogens

2:17:14.400 --> 2:17:17.840
 or like human meddled with pathogens

2:17:17.840 --> 2:17:21.840
 either accidentally get out or get into the hands

2:17:21.840 --> 2:17:25.800
 of bad actors who, whether they're omnicidal maniacs,

2:17:25.800 --> 2:17:28.560
 you know, either way.

2:17:28.560 --> 2:17:31.160
 And so that means we need more robustness for that.

2:17:31.160 --> 2:17:33.920
 And you would think that us having this nice little dry run,

2:17:33.920 --> 2:17:36.320
 which is what as awful as COVID was,

2:17:37.880 --> 2:17:39.480
 and all those poor people that died,

2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:42.800
 it was still like child's play compared

2:17:42.800 --> 2:17:45.800
 to what a future one could be in terms of fatality rate.

2:17:45.800 --> 2:17:48.400
 And so you'd think that we would then be coming,

2:17:48.400 --> 2:17:51.000
 we'd be much more robust in our pandemic preparedness.

2:17:52.200 --> 2:17:57.200
 And meanwhile, the budget in the last two years for the US,

2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:02.400
 sorry, they just did this, I can't remember the name

2:18:02.400 --> 2:18:03.320
 of what the actual budget was,

2:18:03.320 --> 2:18:05.440
 but it was like a multi trillion dollar budget

2:18:05.440 --> 2:18:07.360
 that the US just set aside.

2:18:07.360 --> 2:18:09.920
 And originally in that, you know, considering that COVID

2:18:09.920 --> 2:18:12.400
 cost multiple trillions to the economy, right?

2:18:12.400 --> 2:18:14.640
 The original allocation in this new budget

2:18:14.640 --> 2:18:17.320
 for future pandemic preparedness was 60 billion,

2:18:17.320 --> 2:18:20.000
 so tiny proportion of it.

2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:24.520
 That's proceeded to get whittled down to like 30 billion,

2:18:24.520 --> 2:18:27.960
 to 15 billion, all the way down to 2 billion

2:18:27.960 --> 2:18:28.880
 out of multiple trillions.

2:18:28.880 --> 2:18:31.520
 For a thing that has just cost us multiple trillions,

2:18:31.520 --> 2:18:33.080
 we've just finished, we're barely even,

2:18:33.080 --> 2:18:34.720
 we're not even really out of it.

2:18:34.720 --> 2:18:36.560
 It basically got whittled down to nothing

2:18:36.560 --> 2:18:38.480
 because for some reason people think that,

2:18:38.480 --> 2:18:40.000
 oh, all right, we've got the pandemic,

2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:42.360
 out of the way, that was that one.

2:18:42.360 --> 2:18:44.680
 And the reason for that is that people are,

2:18:44.680 --> 2:18:47.200
 and I say this with all due respect

2:18:47.200 --> 2:18:48.320
 to a lot of the science community,

2:18:48.320 --> 2:18:52.800
 but there's an immense amount of naivety about,

2:18:52.800 --> 2:18:56.800
 they think that nature is the main risk moving forward,

2:18:56.800 --> 2:18:58.120
 and it really isn't.

2:18:59.120 --> 2:19:00.440
 And I think nothing demonstrates this more

2:19:00.440 --> 2:19:03.240
 than this project that I was just reading about

2:19:03.240 --> 2:19:07.760
 that's sort of being proposed right now called Deep Vision.

2:19:07.760 --> 2:19:10.360
 And the idea is to go out into the wilds,

2:19:10.360 --> 2:19:13.160
 and we're not talking about just like within cities,

2:19:13.160 --> 2:19:15.840
 like deep into like caves that people don't go to,

2:19:15.840 --> 2:19:18.880
 deep into the Arctic, wherever, scour the earth

2:19:18.880 --> 2:19:22.240
 for whatever the most dangerous possible pathogens

2:19:22.240 --> 2:19:24.560
 could be that they can find.

2:19:24.560 --> 2:19:27.960
 And then not only do, try and find these,

2:19:27.960 --> 2:19:31.200
 bring samples of them back to laboratories.

2:19:31.200 --> 2:19:34.240
 And again, whether you think COVID was a lab leak or not,

2:19:34.240 --> 2:19:35.560
 I'm not gonna get into that,

2:19:35.560 --> 2:19:38.520
 but we have historically had so many, as a civilization,

2:19:38.520 --> 2:19:40.760
 we've had so many lab leaks

2:19:40.760 --> 2:19:42.800
 from even like the highest level security things.

2:19:42.800 --> 2:19:45.680
 Like it's just, people should go and just read it.

2:19:45.680 --> 2:19:48.680
 It's like a comedy show of just how many they are,

2:19:48.680 --> 2:19:50.280
 how leaky these labs are,

2:19:50.280 --> 2:19:52.720
 even when they do their best efforts.

2:19:52.720 --> 2:19:55.680
 So bring these things then back to civilization.

2:19:55.680 --> 2:19:57.240
 That's step one of the badness.

2:19:57.240 --> 2:20:01.040
 Then the next step would be to then categorize them,

2:20:01.040 --> 2:20:02.600
 do experiments on them and categorize them

2:20:02.600 --> 2:20:04.320
 by their level of potential.

2:20:04.320 --> 2:20:07.320
 And then the piece de resistance on this plan

2:20:07.320 --> 2:20:11.560
 is to then publish that information freely on the internet

2:20:11.560 --> 2:20:13.720
 about all these pathogens, including their genome,

2:20:13.720 --> 2:20:15.680
 which is literally like the building instructions

2:20:15.680 --> 2:20:18.080
 of how to do them on the internet.

2:20:18.080 --> 2:20:20.280
 And this is something that genuinely,

2:20:20.280 --> 2:20:23.080
 a pocket of the like bio,

2:20:23.080 --> 2:20:26.560
 of the scientific community thinks is a good idea.

2:20:26.560 --> 2:20:28.880
 And I think on expectation, like the,

2:20:28.880 --> 2:20:31.440
 and their argument is, is that, oh, this is good,

2:20:31.440 --> 2:20:35.360
 because it might buy us some time to develop the vaccines,

2:20:35.360 --> 2:20:37.880
 which, okay, sure, maybe would have made sense

2:20:37.880 --> 2:20:40.480
 prior to mRNA technology, but you know, like they,

2:20:40.480 --> 2:20:43.760
 mRNA, we can develop a vaccine now

2:20:43.760 --> 2:20:46.880
 when we find a new pathogen within a couple of days.

2:20:46.880 --> 2:20:48.520
 Now then there's all the trials and so on.

2:20:48.520 --> 2:20:50.040
 Those trials would have to happen anyway,

2:20:50.040 --> 2:20:51.440
 in the case of a brand new thing.

2:20:51.440 --> 2:20:53.400
 So you're saving maybe a couple of days.

2:20:53.400 --> 2:20:54.520
 So that's the upside.

2:20:54.520 --> 2:20:58.160
 Meanwhile, the downside is you're not only giving,

2:20:58.160 --> 2:21:00.000
 you're not only giving the vaccine,

2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:03.200
 you're bringing the risk of these pathogens

2:21:03.200 --> 2:21:04.040
 of like getting leaked,

2:21:04.040 --> 2:21:06.400
 but you're literally handing it out

2:21:06.400 --> 2:21:10.320
 to every bad actor on earth who would be doing cartwheels.

2:21:10.320 --> 2:21:13.280
 And I'm talking about like Kim Jong Un, ISIS,

2:21:13.280 --> 2:21:14.880
 people who like want,

2:21:14.880 --> 2:21:17.200
 they think the rest of the world is their enemy.

2:21:17.200 --> 2:21:19.760
 And in some cases they think that killing it themselves

2:21:19.760 --> 2:21:22.680
 is like a noble cause.

2:21:22.680 --> 2:21:24.240
 And you're literally giving them the building blocks

2:21:24.240 --> 2:21:25.080
 of how to do this.

2:21:25.080 --> 2:21:26.920
 It's the most batshit idea I've ever heard.

2:21:26.920 --> 2:21:29.560
 Like on expectation, it's probably like minus EV

2:21:29.560 --> 2:21:31.640
 of like multiple billions of lives

2:21:31.640 --> 2:21:33.440
 if they actually succeeded in doing this.

2:21:33.440 --> 2:21:35.760
 Certainly in the tens or hundreds of millions.

2:21:35.760 --> 2:21:38.840
 So the cost benefit is so unbelievably, it makes no sense.

2:21:38.840 --> 2:21:42.120
 And I was trying to wrap my head around like why,

2:21:42.120 --> 2:21:44.920
 like what's going wrong in people's minds

2:21:44.920 --> 2:21:46.640
 to think that this is a good idea?

2:21:46.640 --> 2:21:50.000
 And it's not that it's malice or anything like that.

2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:53.600
 I think it's that people don't,

2:21:53.600 --> 2:21:57.400
 the proponents, they're actually overly naive

2:21:57.400 --> 2:22:00.680
 about the interactions of humanity.

2:22:00.680 --> 2:22:02.880
 And well, like there are bad actors

2:22:02.880 --> 2:22:04.920
 who will use this for bad things.

2:22:04.920 --> 2:22:06.120
 Because not only will it,

2:22:07.440 --> 2:22:08.920
 if you publish this information,

2:22:08.920 --> 2:22:12.200
 even if a bad actor couldn't physically make it themselves,

2:22:12.200 --> 2:22:14.080
 which given in 10 years time,

2:22:14.080 --> 2:22:18.000
 like the technology is getting cheaper and easier to use.

2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:20.400
 But even if they couldn't make it, they could now bluff it.

2:22:20.400 --> 2:22:22.960
 Like what would you do if there's like some deadly new virus

2:22:22.960 --> 2:22:26.120
 that we were published on the internet

2:22:26.120 --> 2:22:27.560
 in terms of its building blocks?

2:22:27.560 --> 2:22:28.600
 Kim Jong Un could be like,

2:22:28.600 --> 2:22:31.560
 hey, if you don't let me build my nuclear weapons,

2:22:31.560 --> 2:22:33.600
 I'm gonna release this, I've managed to build it.

2:22:33.600 --> 2:22:35.440
 Well, now he's actually got a credible bluff.

2:22:35.440 --> 2:22:36.440
 We don't know.

2:22:36.440 --> 2:22:39.320
 And so that's, it's just like handing the keys,

2:22:39.320 --> 2:22:42.360
 it's handing weapons of mass destruction to people.

2:22:42.360 --> 2:22:43.200
 Makes no sense.

2:22:43.200 --> 2:22:44.520
 The possible, I agree with you,

2:22:44.520 --> 2:22:48.240
 but the possible world in which it might make sense

2:22:48.240 --> 2:22:53.240
 is if the good guys, which is a whole nother problem,

2:22:53.760 --> 2:22:55.480
 defining who the good guys are,

2:22:55.480 --> 2:22:59.640
 but the good guys are like an order of magnitude

2:22:59.640 --> 2:23:00.920
 higher competence.

2:23:01.840 --> 2:23:06.720
 And so they can stay ahead of the bad actors

2:23:06.720 --> 2:23:10.080
 by just being very good at the defense.

2:23:10.080 --> 2:23:13.720
 By very good, not meaning like a little bit better,

2:23:13.720 --> 2:23:15.880
 but an order of magnitude better.

2:23:15.880 --> 2:23:17.200
 But of course the question is,

2:23:17.200 --> 2:23:21.680
 in each of those individual disciplines, is that feasible?

2:23:21.680 --> 2:23:23.440
 Can you, can the bad actors,

2:23:23.440 --> 2:23:25.840
 even if they don't have the competence leapfrog

2:23:25.840 --> 2:23:29.680
 to the place where the good guys are?

2:23:29.680 --> 2:23:31.600
 Yeah, I mean, I would agree in principle

2:23:32.760 --> 2:23:35.720
 with pertaining to this like particular plan of like,

2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:38.480
 that, you know, with the thing I described,

2:23:38.480 --> 2:23:40.320
 this deep vision thing, where at least then

2:23:40.320 --> 2:23:42.160
 that would maybe make sense for steps one and step two

2:23:42.160 --> 2:23:43.400
 of like getting the information,

2:23:43.400 --> 2:23:45.640
 but then why would you release it,

2:23:45.640 --> 2:23:47.240
 the information to your literal enemies?

2:23:47.240 --> 2:23:49.000
 You know, that's, that makes,

2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:52.560
 that doesn't fit at all in that perspective

2:23:52.560 --> 2:23:53.560
 of like trying to be ahead of them.

2:23:53.560 --> 2:23:55.000
 You're literally handing them the weapon.

2:23:55.000 --> 2:23:56.640
 But there's different levels of release, right?

2:23:56.640 --> 2:24:00.520
 So there's the kind of secrecy

2:24:00.520 --> 2:24:02.440
 where you don't give it to anybody,

2:24:02.440 --> 2:24:05.480
 but there's a release where you incrementally give it

2:24:05.480 --> 2:24:07.720
 to like major labs.

2:24:07.720 --> 2:24:09.400
 So it's not public release, but it's like,

2:24:09.400 --> 2:24:10.240
 you're giving it to major labs.

2:24:10.240 --> 2:24:12.880
 Yeah, there's different layers of reasonability, but.

2:24:12.880 --> 2:24:14.640
 But the problem there is it's going to,

2:24:14.640 --> 2:24:18.160
 if you go anywhere beyond like complete secrecy,

2:24:18.160 --> 2:24:19.720
 it's gonna leak.

2:24:19.720 --> 2:24:21.600
 That's the thing, it's very hard to keep secrets.

2:24:21.600 --> 2:24:23.440
 And so that's still. Information is.

2:24:23.440 --> 2:24:25.920
 So you might as well release it to the public

2:24:25.920 --> 2:24:26.920
 is that argument.

2:24:26.920 --> 2:24:29.600
 So you either go complete secrecy

2:24:29.600 --> 2:24:31.720
 or you release it to the public.

2:24:31.720 --> 2:24:33.960
 So, which is essentially the same thing.

2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:35.920
 It's going to leak anyway,

2:24:35.920 --> 2:24:38.240
 if you don't do complete secrecy.

2:24:38.240 --> 2:24:39.840
 Right, which is why you shouldn't get the information

2:24:39.840 --> 2:24:40.680
 in the first place.

2:24:40.680 --> 2:24:43.720
 Yeah, I mean, what, in that, I think.

2:24:43.720 --> 2:24:44.920
 Well, that's a solution.

2:24:44.920 --> 2:24:46.640
 Yeah, the solution is either don't get the information

2:24:46.640 --> 2:24:50.880
 in the first place or B, keep it incredibly,

2:24:50.880 --> 2:24:52.240
 incredibly contained.

2:24:52.240 --> 2:24:54.560
 See, I think, I think it really matters

2:24:54.560 --> 2:24:55.800
 which discipline we're talking about.

2:24:55.800 --> 2:24:59.680
 So in the case of biology, I do think you're very right.

2:24:59.680 --> 2:25:02.520
 We shouldn't even be, it should be forbidden

2:25:02.520 --> 2:25:06.640
 to even like, think about that.

2:25:06.640 --> 2:25:08.520
 Meaning don't collect, don't just even collect

2:25:08.520 --> 2:25:11.120
 the information, but like, don't do,

2:25:11.120 --> 2:25:14.880
 I mean, gain of function research is a really iffy area.

2:25:14.880 --> 2:25:15.880
 Like you start.

2:25:15.880 --> 2:25:17.640
 I mean, it's all about cost benefits, right?

2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:19.240
 There are some scenarios where I could imagine

2:25:19.240 --> 2:25:21.280
 the cost benefit of a gain of function research

2:25:21.280 --> 2:25:24.400
 is very, very clear, where you've evaluated

2:25:24.400 --> 2:25:26.760
 all the potential risks, factored in the probability

2:25:26.760 --> 2:25:27.800
 that things can go wrong.

2:25:27.800 --> 2:25:29.760
 And like, you know, not only known unknowns,

2:25:29.760 --> 2:25:32.320
 but unknown unknowns as well, tried to quantify that.

2:25:32.320 --> 2:25:34.400
 And then even then it's like orders of magnitude

2:25:34.400 --> 2:25:35.400
 better to do that.

2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:36.720
 I'm behind that argument.

2:25:36.720 --> 2:25:38.920
 But the point is that there's this like,

2:25:38.920 --> 2:25:40.960
 naivety that's preventing people from even doing

2:25:40.960 --> 2:25:43.280
 the cost benefit properly on a lot of the things

2:25:43.280 --> 2:25:45.880
 because, you know, I get it.

2:25:45.880 --> 2:25:48.680
 The science community, again, I don't want to bucket

2:25:48.680 --> 2:25:50.240
 the science community, but like some people

2:25:50.240 --> 2:25:52.600
 within the science community just think

2:25:52.600 --> 2:25:54.800
 that everyone's good and everyone just cares

2:25:54.800 --> 2:25:56.880
 about getting knowledge and doing the best for the world.

2:25:56.880 --> 2:25:58.040
 And unfortunately, that's not the case.

2:25:58.040 --> 2:26:00.880
 I wish we lived in that world, but we don't.

2:26:00.880 --> 2:26:02.360
 Yeah, I mean, there's a lie.

2:26:02.360 --> 2:26:05.600
 Listen, I've been criticizing the science community

2:26:05.600 --> 2:26:07.360
 broadly quite a bit.

2:26:07.360 --> 2:26:09.840
 There's so many brilliant people that brilliance

2:26:09.840 --> 2:26:11.280
 is somehow a hindrance sometimes

2:26:11.280 --> 2:26:13.160
 because it has a bunch of blind spots.

2:26:13.160 --> 2:26:16.400
 And then you start to look at the history of science,

2:26:16.400 --> 2:26:19.040
 how easily it's been used by dictators

2:26:19.040 --> 2:26:20.880
 to any conclusion they want.

2:26:20.880 --> 2:26:24.880
 And it's dark how you can use brilliant people

2:26:24.880 --> 2:26:27.160
 that like playing the little game of science

2:26:27.160 --> 2:26:28.800
 because it is a fun game.

2:26:28.800 --> 2:26:30.720
 You know, you're building, you're going to conferences,

2:26:30.720 --> 2:26:32.320
 you're building on top of each other's ideas,

2:26:32.320 --> 2:26:33.240
 there's breakthroughs.

2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:37.040
 Hi, I think I've realized how this particular molecule works

2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:38.560
 and I could do this kind of experiment

2:26:38.560 --> 2:26:39.680
 and everyone else is impressed.

2:26:39.680 --> 2:26:40.520
 Ooh, cool.

2:26:40.520 --> 2:26:41.400
 No, I think you're wrong.

2:26:41.400 --> 2:26:42.480
 Let me show you why you're wrong.

2:26:42.480 --> 2:26:44.840
 And that little game, everyone gets really excited

2:26:44.840 --> 2:26:47.080
 and they get excited, oh, I came up with a pill

2:26:47.080 --> 2:26:48.040
 that solves this problem

2:26:48.040 --> 2:26:49.480
 and it's going to help a bunch of people.

2:26:49.480 --> 2:26:51.360
 And I came up with a giant study

2:26:51.360 --> 2:26:54.480
 that shows the exact probability it's going to help or not.

2:26:54.480 --> 2:26:56.320
 And you get lost in this game

2:26:56.320 --> 2:27:00.080
 and you forget to realize this game, just like Moloch,

2:27:01.160 --> 2:27:03.040
 can have like...

2:27:03.040 --> 2:27:03.880
 Unintended consequences.

2:27:03.880 --> 2:27:04.720
 Yeah.

2:27:04.720 --> 2:27:06.920
 Unintended consequences that might

2:27:06.920 --> 2:27:08.800
 destroy human civilization.

2:27:08.800 --> 2:27:09.640
 Right.

2:27:09.640 --> 2:27:12.840
 Or divide human civilization

2:27:12.840 --> 2:27:17.520
 or have dire geopolitical consequences.

2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:20.320
 I mean, the effects of, I mean, it's just so...

2:27:20.320 --> 2:27:22.880
 The most destructive effects of COVID

2:27:22.880 --> 2:27:25.760
 have nothing to do with the biology of the virus,

2:27:25.760 --> 2:27:26.600
 it seems like.

2:27:27.520 --> 2:27:29.560
 I mean, I could just list them forever,

2:27:29.560 --> 2:27:32.200
 but like one of them is the complete distress

2:27:32.200 --> 2:27:34.160
 of public institutions.

2:27:34.160 --> 2:27:36.360
 The other one is because of that public distress,

2:27:36.360 --> 2:27:38.840
 I feel like if a much worse pandemic came along,

2:27:39.840 --> 2:27:42.440
 we as a world have now cried wolf.

2:27:42.440 --> 2:27:45.440
 And if an actual wolf now comes,

2:27:45.440 --> 2:27:48.360
 people will be like, fuck masks, fuck...

2:27:48.360 --> 2:27:49.200
 Fuck vaccines, yeah.

2:27:49.200 --> 2:27:50.040
 Fuck everything.

2:27:50.040 --> 2:27:51.680
 And they won't be...

2:27:51.680 --> 2:27:53.560
 They'll distrust every single thing

2:27:53.560 --> 2:27:55.960
 that any major institution is going to tell them.

2:27:55.960 --> 2:27:56.960
 And...

2:27:56.960 --> 2:27:57.800
 Because that's the thing,

2:27:57.800 --> 2:28:02.800
 like there were certain actions made by

2:28:03.720 --> 2:28:07.760
 certain health public figures where they told,

2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:10.760
 they very knowingly told it was a white lie,

2:28:10.760 --> 2:28:12.440
 it was intended in the best possible way,

2:28:12.440 --> 2:28:17.440
 such as early on when there was clearly a shortage of masks.

2:28:20.480 --> 2:28:21.520
 And so they said to the public,

2:28:21.520 --> 2:28:25.000
 oh, don't get masks, there's no evidence that they work.

2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:27.240
 Or don't get them, they don't work.

2:28:27.240 --> 2:28:29.000
 In fact, it might even make it worse.

2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:30.240
 You might even spread it more.

2:28:30.240 --> 2:28:32.280
 Like that was the real like stinker.

2:28:33.120 --> 2:28:35.120
 Yeah, no, no, unless you know how to do it properly,

2:28:35.120 --> 2:28:36.680
 you're gonna make that you're gonna get sicker

2:28:36.680 --> 2:28:38.680
 or you're more likely to catch the virus,

2:28:38.680 --> 2:28:41.320
 which is just absolute crap.

2:28:41.320 --> 2:28:43.160
 And they put that out there.

2:28:43.160 --> 2:28:45.280
 And it's pretty clear the reason why they did that

2:28:45.280 --> 2:28:47.600
 was because there was actually a shortage of masks

2:28:47.600 --> 2:28:50.160
 and they really needed it for health workers,

2:28:50.160 --> 2:28:51.000
 which makes sense.

2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:52.760
 Like, I agree, like, you know,

2:28:52.760 --> 2:28:57.760
 but the cost of lying to the public

2:28:57.840 --> 2:28:59.880
 when that then comes out,

2:28:59.880 --> 2:29:02.720
 people aren't as stupid as they think they are.

2:29:02.720 --> 2:29:05.840
 And that's, I think where this distrust of experts

2:29:05.840 --> 2:29:06.680
 has largely come from.

2:29:06.680 --> 2:29:09.360
 A, they've lied to people overtly,

2:29:09.360 --> 2:29:13.160
 but B, people have been treated like idiots.

2:29:13.160 --> 2:29:14.440
 Now, that's not to say that there aren't a lot

2:29:14.440 --> 2:29:16.160
 of stupid people who have a lot of wacky ideas

2:29:16.160 --> 2:29:18.240
 around COVID and all sorts of things.

2:29:18.240 --> 2:29:21.560
 But if you treat the general public like children,

2:29:21.560 --> 2:29:23.520
 they're going to see that, they're going to notice that.

2:29:23.520 --> 2:29:26.760
 And that is going to just like absolutely decimate the trust

2:29:26.760 --> 2:29:29.520
 in the public institutions that we depend upon.

2:29:29.520 --> 2:29:32.240
 And honestly, the best thing that could happen,

2:29:32.240 --> 2:29:34.720
 I wish like if like Fauci or, you know,

2:29:34.720 --> 2:29:36.880
 and these other like leaders who, I mean, God,

2:29:36.880 --> 2:29:39.760
 I would, I can't imagine how nightmare his job has been

2:29:39.760 --> 2:29:41.040
 for the last few years, hell on earth.

2:29:41.040 --> 2:29:43.480
 Like, so, you know, I, you know,

2:29:43.480 --> 2:29:45.360
 I have a lot of sort of sympathy

2:29:45.360 --> 2:29:46.920
 for the position he's been in.

2:29:46.920 --> 2:29:48.800
 But like, if he could just come out and be like,

2:29:48.800 --> 2:29:51.160
 okay, look, guys, hands up,

2:29:51.160 --> 2:29:53.960
 we didn't handle this as well as we could have.

2:29:53.960 --> 2:29:55.880
 These are all the things I would have done differently

2:29:55.880 --> 2:29:56.720
 in hindsight.

2:29:56.720 --> 2:29:58.680
 I apologize for this and this and this and this.

2:29:58.680 --> 2:30:01.360
 That would go so far.

2:30:01.360 --> 2:30:03.040
 And maybe I'm being naive, who knows,

2:30:03.040 --> 2:30:04.760
 maybe this would backfire, but I don't think it would.

2:30:04.760 --> 2:30:06.240
 Like to someone like me even,

2:30:06.240 --> 2:30:07.360
 cause I've like, I've lost trust

2:30:07.360 --> 2:30:08.840
 in a lot of these things.

2:30:08.840 --> 2:30:10.360
 But I'm fortunate that I at least know people

2:30:10.360 --> 2:30:11.680
 who I can go to who I think are good,

2:30:11.680 --> 2:30:14.320
 like have good epistemics on this stuff.

2:30:14.320 --> 2:30:16.240
 But you know, if they, if they could sort of put their hands

2:30:16.240 --> 2:30:18.240
 on my go, okay, these are the spots where we screwed up.

2:30:18.240 --> 2:30:21.280
 This, this, this, this was our reasons.

2:30:21.280 --> 2:30:22.760
 Yeah, we actually told a little white lie here.

2:30:22.760 --> 2:30:23.720
 We did it for this reason.

2:30:23.720 --> 2:30:24.960
 We're really sorry.

2:30:24.960 --> 2:30:26.760
 Where they just did the radical honesty thing,

2:30:26.760 --> 2:30:28.680
 the radical transparency thing,

2:30:28.680 --> 2:30:32.120
 that would go so far to rebuilding public trust.

2:30:32.120 --> 2:30:33.320
 And I think that's what needs to happen.

2:30:33.320 --> 2:30:34.160
 Otherwise.

2:30:34.160 --> 2:30:35.000
 I totally agree with you.

2:30:35.000 --> 2:30:38.680
 Unfortunately, yeah, his job was very tough

2:30:38.680 --> 2:30:42.920
 and all those kinds of things, but I see arrogance

2:30:42.920 --> 2:30:46.080
 and arrogance prevented him from being honest

2:30:46.080 --> 2:30:47.840
 in that way previously.

2:30:47.840 --> 2:30:49.480
 And I think arrogance will prevent him

2:30:49.480 --> 2:30:51.040
 from being honest in that way.

2:30:51.040 --> 2:30:52.840
 Now we need leaders.

2:30:52.840 --> 2:30:55.440
 I think young people are seeing that,

2:30:55.440 --> 2:30:59.960
 that kind of talking down to people

2:30:59.960 --> 2:31:04.360
 from a position of power, I hope is the way of the past.

2:31:04.360 --> 2:31:06.120
 People really like authenticity

2:31:06.120 --> 2:31:10.600
 and they like leaders that are like a man

2:31:10.600 --> 2:31:12.320
 and a woman of the people.

2:31:12.320 --> 2:31:15.000
 And I think that just.

2:31:15.000 --> 2:31:17.040
 I mean, he still has a chance to do that, I think.

2:31:17.040 --> 2:31:19.280
 I mean, I don't wanna, you know, I don't think, you know,

2:31:19.280 --> 2:31:21.560
 if I doubt he's listening, but if he is like,

2:31:21.560 --> 2:31:25.160
 hey, I think, you know, I don't think he's irredeemable

2:31:25.160 --> 2:31:26.000
 by any means.

2:31:26.000 --> 2:31:28.720
 I think there's, you know, I don't have an opinion

2:31:28.720 --> 2:31:30.680
 whether there was arrogance or there or not.

2:31:30.680 --> 2:31:34.440
 Just know that I think like coming clean on the, you know,

2:31:34.440 --> 2:31:37.600
 it's understandable to have fucked up during this pandemic.

2:31:37.600 --> 2:31:39.400
 Like I won't expect any government to handle it well

2:31:39.400 --> 2:31:42.840
 because it was so difficult, like so many moving pieces,

2:31:42.840 --> 2:31:45.160
 so much like lack of information and so on.

2:31:46.040 --> 2:31:49.320
 But the step to rebuilding trust is to go, okay, look,

2:31:49.320 --> 2:31:51.280
 we're doing a scrutiny of where we went wrong.

2:31:51.280 --> 2:31:53.880
 And for my part, I did this wrong in this part.

2:31:53.880 --> 2:31:55.120
 And that would be huge.

2:31:55.120 --> 2:31:56.000
 All of us can do that.

2:31:56.000 --> 2:31:57.360
 I mean, I was struggling for a while

2:31:57.360 --> 2:32:00.000
 whether I want to talk to him or not.

2:32:00.000 --> 2:32:01.920
 I talked to his boss, Francis Collins.

2:32:03.600 --> 2:32:06.360
 Another person that's screwed up in terms of trust,

2:32:08.040 --> 2:32:10.280
 lost a little bit of my respect too.

2:32:10.280 --> 2:32:14.640
 There seems to have been a kind of dishonesty

2:32:14.640 --> 2:32:19.640
 in the backrooms in that they didn't trust people

2:32:21.080 --> 2:32:23.040
 to be intelligent.

2:32:23.040 --> 2:32:26.000
 Like we need to tell them what's good for them.

2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:27.480
 We know what's good for them.

2:32:27.480 --> 2:32:28.960
 That kind of idea.

2:32:28.960 --> 2:32:33.400
 To be fair, the thing that's, what's it called?

2:32:33.400 --> 2:32:36.360
 I heard the phrase today, nut picking.

2:32:36.360 --> 2:32:37.760
 Social media does that.

2:32:37.760 --> 2:32:39.040
 So you've got like nitpicking.

2:32:39.040 --> 2:32:44.040
 Nut picking is where the craziest, stupidest,

2:32:44.360 --> 2:32:45.880
 you know, if you have a group of people,

2:32:45.880 --> 2:32:47.720
 let's say people who are vaccine,

2:32:47.720 --> 2:32:48.720
 I don't like the term anti vaccine,

2:32:48.720 --> 2:32:51.720
 people who are vaccine hesitant, vaccine speculative.

2:32:51.720 --> 2:32:56.720
 So what social media did or the media or anyone,

2:32:57.320 --> 2:33:01.000
 their opponents would do is pick the craziest example.

2:33:01.000 --> 2:33:02.280
 So the ones who are like,

2:33:02.280 --> 2:33:06.240
 I think I need to inject myself with motor oil

2:33:06.240 --> 2:33:07.920
 up my ass or something.

2:33:07.920 --> 2:33:11.920
 Select the craziest ones and then have that beamed too.

2:33:11.920 --> 2:33:14.680
 So from like someone like Fauci or Francis's perspective,

2:33:14.680 --> 2:33:16.240
 that's what they get because they're getting

2:33:16.240 --> 2:33:17.440
 the same social media stuff as us.

2:33:17.440 --> 2:33:19.000
 They're getting the same media reports.

2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:20.920
 I mean, they might get some more information,

2:33:20.920 --> 2:33:24.880
 but they too are gonna get the nuts portrayed to them.

2:33:24.880 --> 2:33:27.240
 So they probably have a misrepresentation

2:33:27.240 --> 2:33:29.320
 of what the actual public's intelligence is.

2:33:29.320 --> 2:33:31.280
 Well, that's just, yes.

2:33:31.280 --> 2:33:33.640
 And that just means they're not social media savvy.

2:33:33.640 --> 2:33:36.000
 So one of the skills of being on social media

2:33:36.000 --> 2:33:37.880
 is to be able to filter that in your mind,

2:33:37.880 --> 2:33:40.080
 like to understand, to put into proper context.

2:33:40.080 --> 2:33:41.800
 To realize that what you are seeing,

2:33:41.800 --> 2:33:43.960
 social media is not anywhere near

2:33:43.960 --> 2:33:46.600
 an accurate representation of humanity.

2:33:46.600 --> 2:33:49.520
 Nut picking, and there's nothing wrong

2:33:49.520 --> 2:33:51.320
 with putting motor oil up your ass.

2:33:51.320 --> 2:33:54.440
 It's just one of the better aspects of,

2:33:54.440 --> 2:33:56.320
 I do this every weekend.

2:33:56.320 --> 2:33:57.160
 Okay.

2:33:58.280 --> 2:33:59.800
 Where the hell did that analogy come from in my mind?

2:33:59.800 --> 2:34:00.640
 Like what?

2:34:00.640 --> 2:34:01.480
 I don't know.

2:34:01.480 --> 2:34:03.680
 I think you need to, there's some Freudian thing

2:34:03.680 --> 2:34:06.600
 you would need to deeply investigate with a therapist.

2:34:06.600 --> 2:34:08.240
 Okay, what about AI?

2:34:08.240 --> 2:34:13.040
 Are you worried about AGI, super intelligence systems

2:34:13.040 --> 2:34:16.180
 or paperclip maximizer type of situation?

2:34:16.180 --> 2:34:19.940
 Yes, I'm definitely worried about it,

2:34:19.940 --> 2:34:23.220
 but I feel kind of bipolar in the,

2:34:23.220 --> 2:34:24.780
 some days I wake up and I'm like.

2:34:24.780 --> 2:34:26.100
 You're excited about the future?

2:34:26.100 --> 2:34:26.940
 Well, exactly.

2:34:26.940 --> 2:34:29.420
 I'm like, wow, we can unlock the mysteries of the universe.

2:34:29.420 --> 2:34:30.620
 You know, escape the game.

2:34:30.620 --> 2:34:34.340
 And this, you know,

2:34:34.340 --> 2:34:35.740
 because I spend all my time thinking

2:34:35.740 --> 2:34:37.460
 about these molecule problems that, you know,

2:34:37.460 --> 2:34:39.260
 what is the solution to them?

2:34:39.260 --> 2:34:41.780
 What, you know, in some ways you need this like

2:34:41.780 --> 2:34:46.780
 omni benevolent, omniscient, omni wise coordination mechanism

2:34:49.100 --> 2:34:53.260
 that can like make us all not do the molecule thing

2:34:53.260 --> 2:34:55.540
 or like provide the infrastructure

2:34:55.540 --> 2:34:57.460
 or redesign the system so that it's not vulnerable

2:34:57.460 --> 2:34:58.900
 to this molecule process.

2:34:59.940 --> 2:35:01.180
 And in some ways, you know,

2:35:01.180 --> 2:35:02.540
 that's the strongest argument to me

2:35:02.540 --> 2:35:04.940
 for like the race to build AGI

2:35:04.940 --> 2:35:08.020
 is that maybe, you know, we can't survive without it.

2:35:08.020 --> 2:35:12.460
 But the flip side to that is the,

2:35:12.460 --> 2:35:14.900
 the unfortunately now that there's multiple actors

2:35:14.900 --> 2:35:17.780
 trying to build AI, AGI, you know,

2:35:17.780 --> 2:35:19.940
 this was fine 10 years ago when it was just DeepMind,

2:35:19.940 --> 2:35:22.060
 but then other companies started up

2:35:22.060 --> 2:35:23.380
 and now it created a race dynamic.

2:35:23.380 --> 2:35:25.660
 Now it's like, that's the whole thing.

2:35:25.660 --> 2:35:28.020
 Is it the same, it's got the same problem.

2:35:28.020 --> 2:35:31.500
 It's like whichever company is the one that like optimizes

2:35:31.500 --> 2:35:33.620
 for speed at the cost of safety

2:35:33.620 --> 2:35:35.340
 will get the competitive advantage.

2:35:35.340 --> 2:35:37.380
 And so we're the more likely the ones to build the AGI,

2:35:37.380 --> 2:35:40.260
 you know, and that's the same cycle that you're in.

2:35:40.260 --> 2:35:41.580
 And there's no clear solution to that

2:35:41.580 --> 2:35:45.020
 because you can't just go like slapping,

2:35:46.820 --> 2:35:51.140
 if you go and try and like stop all the different companies,

2:35:51.140 --> 2:35:54.620
 then it will, you know, the good ones will stop

2:35:54.620 --> 2:35:55.660
 because they're the ones, you know,

2:35:55.660 --> 2:35:57.700
 within the West's reach,

2:35:57.700 --> 2:35:59.980
 but then that leaves all the other ones to continue

2:35:59.980 --> 2:36:00.980
 and then they're even more likely.

2:36:00.980 --> 2:36:03.140
 So it's like, it's a very difficult problem

2:36:03.140 --> 2:36:04.420
 with no clean solution.

2:36:04.420 --> 2:36:08.580
 And, you know, at the same time, you know,

2:36:08.580 --> 2:36:12.100
 I know at least some of the folks at DeepMind

2:36:12.100 --> 2:36:13.740
 and they're incredible and they're thinking about this.

2:36:13.740 --> 2:36:15.020
 They're very aware of this problem.

2:36:15.020 --> 2:36:17.020
 And they're like, you know,

2:36:17.020 --> 2:36:18.660
 I think some of the smartest people on earth.

2:36:18.660 --> 2:36:20.580
 Yeah, the culture is important there

2:36:20.580 --> 2:36:21.940
 because they are thinking about that

2:36:21.940 --> 2:36:26.180
 and they're some of the best machine learning engineers.

2:36:26.180 --> 2:36:29.780
 So it's possible to have a company or a community of people

2:36:29.780 --> 2:36:31.700
 that are both great engineers

2:36:31.700 --> 2:36:33.740
 and are thinking about the philosophical topics.

2:36:33.740 --> 2:36:36.700
 Exactly, and importantly, they're also game theorists,

2:36:36.700 --> 2:36:38.260
 you know, and because this is ultimately

2:36:38.260 --> 2:36:41.620
 a game theory problem, the thing, this Moloch mechanism

2:36:41.620 --> 2:36:46.620
 and like, you know, how do we voice arms race scenarios?

2:36:47.340 --> 2:36:50.020
 You need people who aren't naive to be thinking about this.

2:36:50.020 --> 2:36:51.980
 And again, like luckily there's a lot of smart,

2:36:51.980 --> 2:36:54.780
 non naive game theorists within that group.

2:36:54.780 --> 2:36:57.660
 Yes, I'm concerned about it and I think it's again,

2:36:57.660 --> 2:37:01.300
 a thing that we need people to be thinking about

2:37:01.300 --> 2:37:03.820
 in terms of like, how do we create,

2:37:03.820 --> 2:37:05.980
 how do we mitigate the arms race dynamics

2:37:05.980 --> 2:37:10.260
 and how do we solve the thing of,

2:37:10.260 --> 2:37:13.580
 Bostrom calls it the orthogonality problem whereby,

2:37:14.500 --> 2:37:16.060
 because it's obviously there's a chance, you know,

2:37:16.060 --> 2:37:17.500
 the belief, the hope is,

2:37:17.500 --> 2:37:19.780
 is that you build something that's super intelligent

2:37:19.780 --> 2:37:22.980
 and by definition of being super intelligent,

2:37:22.980 --> 2:37:25.140
 it will also become super wise

2:37:25.140 --> 2:37:27.820
 and have the wisdom to know what the right goals are.

2:37:27.820 --> 2:37:30.980
 And hopefully those goals include keeping humanity alive.

2:37:30.980 --> 2:37:31.980
 Right?

2:37:31.980 --> 2:37:35.300
 But Bostrom says that actually those two things,

2:37:35.300 --> 2:37:38.340
 you know, super intelligence and super wisdom

2:37:39.220 --> 2:37:40.420
 aren't necessarily correlated.

2:37:40.420 --> 2:37:42.900
 They're actually kind of orthogonal things.

2:37:42.900 --> 2:37:44.820
 And how do we make it so that they are correlated?

2:37:44.820 --> 2:37:45.660
 How do we guarantee it?

2:37:45.660 --> 2:37:47.020
 Because we need it to be guaranteed really,

2:37:47.020 --> 2:37:48.900
 to know that we're doing the thing safely.

2:37:48.900 --> 2:37:53.900
 But I think that like merging of intelligence and wisdom,

2:37:54.460 --> 2:37:56.940
 at least my hope is that this whole process

2:37:56.940 --> 2:37:58.860
 happens sufficiently slowly

2:37:58.860 --> 2:38:01.500
 that we're constantly having these kinds of debates

2:38:01.500 --> 2:38:06.140
 that we have enough time to figure out

2:38:06.140 --> 2:38:07.900
 how to modify each version of the system

2:38:07.900 --> 2:38:09.580
 as it becomes more and more intelligent.

2:38:09.580 --> 2:38:12.020
 Yes, buying time is a good thing, definitely.

2:38:12.020 --> 2:38:14.220
 Anything that slows everything down.

2:38:14.220 --> 2:38:16.060
 We just, everyone needs to chill out.

2:38:16.060 --> 2:38:19.540
 We've got millennia to figure this out.

2:38:19.540 --> 2:38:20.380
 Yeah.

2:38:21.580 --> 2:38:25.580
 Or at least, at least, well, it depends.

2:38:25.580 --> 2:38:27.820
 Again, some people think that, you know,

2:38:27.820 --> 2:38:29.820
 we can't even make it through the next few decades

2:38:29.820 --> 2:38:31.580
 without having some kind of

2:38:33.260 --> 2:38:36.300
 omni wise coordination mechanism.

2:38:36.300 --> 2:38:37.940
 And there's also an argument to that.

2:38:37.940 --> 2:38:39.380
 Yeah, I don't know.

2:38:39.380 --> 2:38:42.220
 Well, there is, I'm suspicious of that kind of thinking

2:38:42.220 --> 2:38:45.220
 because it seems like the entirety of human history

2:38:45.220 --> 2:38:48.580
 has people in it that are like predicting doom

2:38:49.780 --> 2:38:50.780
 just around the corner.

2:38:50.780 --> 2:38:52.700
 There's something about us

2:38:52.700 --> 2:38:56.300
 that is strangely attracted to that thought.

2:38:56.300 --> 2:38:59.700
 It's almost like fun to think about

2:38:59.700 --> 2:39:01.220
 the destruction of everything.

2:39:02.540 --> 2:39:04.340
 Just objectively speaking,

2:39:05.260 --> 2:39:08.180
 I've talked and listened to a bunch of people

2:39:08.180 --> 2:39:11.100
 and they are gravitating towards that.

2:39:11.100 --> 2:39:13.180
 It's almost, I think it's the same thing

2:39:13.180 --> 2:39:15.700
 that people love about conspiracy theories

2:39:15.700 --> 2:39:19.220
 is they love to be the person that kind of figured out

2:39:19.220 --> 2:39:22.140
 some deep fundamental thing about the,

2:39:22.140 --> 2:39:24.780
 that's going to be, it's going to mark something

2:39:24.780 --> 2:39:28.300
 extremely important about the history of human civilization

2:39:28.300 --> 2:39:31.300
 because then I will be important.

2:39:31.300 --> 2:39:33.500
 When in reality, most of us will be forgotten

2:39:33.500 --> 2:39:37.620
 and life will go on.

2:39:37.620 --> 2:39:40.020
 And one of the sad things about

2:39:40.020 --> 2:39:41.980
 whenever anything traumatic happens to you,

2:39:41.980 --> 2:39:46.700
 whenever you lose loved ones or just tragedy happens,

2:39:46.700 --> 2:39:48.220
 you realize life goes on.

2:39:49.140 --> 2:39:52.140
 Even after a nuclear war that will wipe out

2:39:52.140 --> 2:39:55.020
 some large percentage of the population

2:39:55.020 --> 2:40:00.020
 and will torture people for years to come

2:40:00.380 --> 2:40:04.580
 because of the effects of a nuclear winter,

2:40:05.460 --> 2:40:07.260
 people will still survive.

2:40:07.260 --> 2:40:08.700
 Life will still go on.

2:40:08.700 --> 2:40:10.940
 I mean, it depends on the kind of nuclear war.

2:40:10.940 --> 2:40:13.500
 But in the case of nuclear war, it will still go on.

2:40:13.500 --> 2:40:15.820
 That's one of the amazing things about life.

2:40:15.820 --> 2:40:17.060
 It finds a way.

2:40:17.060 --> 2:40:18.940
 And so in that sense, I just,

2:40:18.940 --> 2:40:21.100
 I feel like the doom and gloom thing

2:40:21.100 --> 2:40:23.780
 is a...

2:40:23.780 --> 2:40:24.620
 Well, what we don't, yeah,

2:40:24.620 --> 2:40:26.100
 we don't want a self fulfilling prophecy.

2:40:26.100 --> 2:40:27.500
 Yes, that's exactly.

2:40:27.500 --> 2:40:29.660
 Yes, and I very much agree with that.

2:40:29.660 --> 2:40:32.980
 And I even have a slight feeling

2:40:32.980 --> 2:40:35.780
 from the amount of time we spent in this conversation

2:40:35.780 --> 2:40:36.620
 talking about this,

2:40:36.620 --> 2:40:40.180
 because it's like, is this even a net positive

2:40:40.180 --> 2:40:41.900
 if it's like making everyone feel,

2:40:41.900 --> 2:40:44.980
 oh, in some ways, like making people imagine

2:40:44.980 --> 2:40:47.460
 these bad scenarios can be a self fulfilling prophecy,

2:40:47.460 --> 2:40:51.180
 but at the same time, that's weighed off

2:40:51.180 --> 2:40:54.340
 with at least making people aware of the problem

2:40:54.340 --> 2:40:55.300
 and gets them thinking.

2:40:55.300 --> 2:40:56.260
 And I think particularly,

2:40:56.260 --> 2:40:58.380
 the reason why I wanna talk about this to your audience

2:40:58.380 --> 2:41:00.660
 is that on average, they're the type of people

2:41:00.660 --> 2:41:02.780
 who gravitate towards these kinds of topics

2:41:02.780 --> 2:41:04.260
 because they're intellectually curious

2:41:04.260 --> 2:41:07.860
 and they can sort of sense that there's trouble brewing.

2:41:07.860 --> 2:41:09.420
 They can smell that there's,

2:41:09.420 --> 2:41:10.260
 I think there's a reason

2:41:10.260 --> 2:41:11.460
 that people are thinking about this stuff a lot

2:41:11.460 --> 2:41:14.180
 is because the probability,

2:41:14.180 --> 2:41:16.820
 the probability, it's increased in probability

2:41:16.820 --> 2:41:19.420
 over certainly over the last few years,

2:41:19.420 --> 2:41:21.700
 trajectories have not gone favorably,

2:41:21.700 --> 2:41:24.260
 let's put it since 2010.

2:41:24.260 --> 2:41:28.420
 So it's right, I think, for people to be thinking about it,

2:41:28.420 --> 2:41:30.060
 but that's where they're like,

2:41:30.060 --> 2:41:31.660
 I think whether it's a useful fiction

2:41:31.660 --> 2:41:33.340
 or whether it's actually true

2:41:33.340 --> 2:41:34.420
 or whatever you wanna call it,

2:41:34.420 --> 2:41:35.940
 I think having this faith,

2:41:35.940 --> 2:41:38.060
 this is where faith is valuable

2:41:38.060 --> 2:41:41.140
 because it gives you at least this like anchor of hope.

2:41:41.140 --> 2:41:43.860
 And I'm not just saying it to like trick myself,

2:41:43.860 --> 2:41:44.780
 like I do truly,

2:41:44.780 --> 2:41:47.700
 I do think there's something out there that wants us to win.

2:41:47.700 --> 2:41:49.660
 I think there's something that really wants us to win.

2:41:49.660 --> 2:41:53.060
 And it just, you just have to be like,

2:41:53.060 --> 2:41:55.740
 just like kind of, okay, now I sound really crazy,

2:41:55.740 --> 2:41:58.740
 but like open your heart to it a little bit

2:41:58.740 --> 2:42:03.140
 and it will give you the like,

2:42:03.140 --> 2:42:04.820
 the sort of breathing room

2:42:04.820 --> 2:42:07.660
 with which to marinate on the solutions.

2:42:07.660 --> 2:42:10.340
 We are the ones who have to come up with the solutions,

2:42:10.340 --> 2:42:15.140
 but we can use that.

2:42:15.140 --> 2:42:18.020
 There's like, there's hashtag positivity.

2:42:18.020 --> 2:42:19.300
 There's value in that.

2:42:19.300 --> 2:42:21.300
 Yeah, you have to kind of imagine

2:42:21.300 --> 2:42:24.940
 all the destructive trajectories that lay in our future

2:42:24.940 --> 2:42:27.940
 and then believe in the possibility

2:42:27.940 --> 2:42:29.460
 of avoiding those trajectories.

2:42:29.460 --> 2:42:32.260
 All while, you said audience,

2:42:32.260 --> 2:42:35.100
 all while sitting back, which is majority,

2:42:35.100 --> 2:42:36.660
 the two people that listen to this

2:42:36.660 --> 2:42:38.660
 are probably sitting on a beach,

2:42:38.660 --> 2:42:43.660
 smoking some weed, just, that's a beautiful sunset.

2:42:44.900 --> 2:42:47.900
 They're looking at just the waves going in and out.

2:42:47.900 --> 2:42:50.460
 And ultimately there's a kind of deep belief there

2:42:50.460 --> 2:42:55.460
 in the momentum of humanity to figure it all out.

2:42:56.660 --> 2:42:58.420
 But we've got a lot of work to do.

2:42:58.420 --> 2:43:01.020
 Which is what makes this whole simulation,

2:43:01.020 --> 2:43:02.420
 this video game kind of fun.

2:43:03.380 --> 2:43:05.820
 This battle of polytopia,

2:43:05.820 --> 2:43:08.620
 I still, man, I love those games so much.

2:43:08.620 --> 2:43:09.580
 So good.

2:43:09.580 --> 2:43:11.740
 And that one for people who don't know,

2:43:11.740 --> 2:43:13.700
 Battle of Polytopia is a big,

2:43:13.700 --> 2:43:17.940
 it's like a, is this really radical simplification

2:43:17.940 --> 2:43:20.540
 of a civilization type of game.

2:43:20.540 --> 2:43:24.140
 It still has a lot of the skill tree development,

2:43:24.140 --> 2:43:25.780
 a lot of the strategy,

2:43:27.060 --> 2:43:29.860
 but it's easy enough to play on a phone.

2:43:29.860 --> 2:43:30.700
 Yeah.

2:43:30.700 --> 2:43:31.540
 It's kind of interesting.

2:43:31.540 --> 2:43:33.260
 They've really figured it out.

2:43:33.260 --> 2:43:35.020
 It's one of the most elegantly designed games

2:43:35.020 --> 2:43:35.860
 I've ever seen.

2:43:35.860 --> 2:43:37.940
 It's incredibly complex.

2:43:37.940 --> 2:43:39.580
 And yet being, again, it walks that line

2:43:39.580 --> 2:43:40.980
 between complexity and simplicity

2:43:40.980 --> 2:43:42.620
 in this really, really great way.

2:43:44.180 --> 2:43:45.180
 And they use pretty colors

2:43:45.180 --> 2:43:49.020
 that hack the dopamine reward circuits in our brains.

2:43:49.020 --> 2:43:49.860
 Very well.

2:43:49.860 --> 2:43:50.860
 Yeah, it's fun.

2:43:50.860 --> 2:43:52.300
 Video games are so fun.

2:43:52.300 --> 2:43:53.380
 Yeah.

2:43:53.380 --> 2:43:55.540
 Most of this life is just about fun.

2:43:55.540 --> 2:43:57.740
 Escaping all the suffering to find the fun.

2:43:58.820 --> 2:43:59.940
 What's energy healing?

2:43:59.940 --> 2:44:02.220
 I have in my notes, energy healing question mark.

2:44:02.220 --> 2:44:03.140
 What's that about?

2:44:05.500 --> 2:44:06.860
 Oh man.

2:44:06.860 --> 2:44:09.460
 God, your audience is gonna think I'm mad.

2:44:09.460 --> 2:44:13.180
 So the two crazy things that happened to me,

2:44:13.180 --> 2:44:14.980
 the one was the voice in the head

2:44:14.980 --> 2:44:16.100
 that said you're gonna win this tournament

2:44:16.100 --> 2:44:18.260
 and then I won the tournament.

2:44:18.260 --> 2:44:20.940
 The other craziest thing that's happened to me

2:44:20.940 --> 2:44:23.700
 was in 2018,

2:44:25.300 --> 2:44:30.300
 I started getting this like weird problem in my ear

2:44:30.420 --> 2:44:35.260
 where it was kind of like low frequency sound distortion,

2:44:35.260 --> 2:44:37.300
 where voices, particularly men's voices,

2:44:37.300 --> 2:44:39.580
 became incredibly unpleasant to listen to.

2:44:40.660 --> 2:44:42.380
 It would like create this,

2:44:42.380 --> 2:44:44.100
 it would like be falsely amplified or something

2:44:44.100 --> 2:44:46.340
 and it was almost like a physical sensation in my ear,

2:44:46.340 --> 2:44:48.100
 which was really unpleasant.

2:44:48.100 --> 2:44:50.980
 And it would like last for a few hours and then go away

2:44:50.980 --> 2:44:52.540
 and then come back for a few hours and go away.

2:44:52.540 --> 2:44:54.460
 And I went and got hearing tests

2:44:54.460 --> 2:44:56.340
 and they found that like the bottom end,

2:44:56.340 --> 2:44:58.380
 I was losing the hearing in that ear.

2:45:00.140 --> 2:45:03.740
 And in the end, I got,

2:45:03.740 --> 2:45:05.620
 doctors said they think it was this thing

2:45:05.620 --> 2:45:07.220
 called Meniere's disease,

2:45:07.220 --> 2:45:10.540
 which is this very unpleasant disease

2:45:10.540 --> 2:45:12.100
 where people basically end up losing their hearing,

2:45:12.100 --> 2:45:13.260
 but they get this like,

2:45:14.140 --> 2:45:16.260
 it often comes with like dizzy spells and other things

2:45:16.260 --> 2:45:19.540
 because it's like the inner ear gets all messed up.

2:45:19.540 --> 2:45:21.780
 Now, I don't know if that's actually what I had,

2:45:21.780 --> 2:45:23.420
 but that's what at least a couple of,

2:45:23.420 --> 2:45:24.940
 one doctor said to me.

2:45:24.940 --> 2:45:26.980
 But anyway, so I'd had three months of this stuff,

2:45:26.980 --> 2:45:28.820
 this going on and it was really getting me down.

2:45:28.820 --> 2:45:32.540
 And I was at Burning Man of all places.

2:45:32.540 --> 2:45:35.100
 I don't mean to be that person talking about Burning Man,

2:45:35.100 --> 2:45:36.380
 but I was there.

2:45:36.380 --> 2:45:39.140
 And again, I'd had it and I was unable to listen to music,

2:45:39.140 --> 2:45:40.060
 which is not what you want

2:45:40.060 --> 2:45:42.580
 because Burning Man is a very loud, intense place.

2:45:42.580 --> 2:45:44.060
 And I was just having a really rough time.

2:45:44.060 --> 2:45:45.660
 And on the final night,

2:45:45.660 --> 2:45:49.620
 I get talking to this girl who's like a friend of a friend.

2:45:49.620 --> 2:45:51.020
 And I mentioned, I was like,

2:45:51.020 --> 2:45:52.540
 oh, I'm really down in the dumps about this.

2:45:52.540 --> 2:45:53.380
 And she's like, oh, well,

2:45:53.380 --> 2:45:54.940
 I've done a little bit of energy healing.

2:45:54.940 --> 2:45:56.340
 Would you like me to have a look?

2:45:56.340 --> 2:45:57.900
 And I was like, sure.

2:45:57.900 --> 2:45:59.940
 Now this was again,

2:45:59.940 --> 2:46:03.340
 deep, I was, you know, no time in my life for this.

2:46:03.340 --> 2:46:04.900
 I didn't believe in any of this stuff.

2:46:04.900 --> 2:46:06.100
 I was just like, it's all bullshit.

2:46:06.100 --> 2:46:07.420
 It's all wooey nonsense.

2:46:08.980 --> 2:46:10.740
 But I was like, sure, I'll have a go.

2:46:10.740 --> 2:46:14.020
 And she starts like with her hand and she says,

2:46:14.020 --> 2:46:15.340
 oh, there's something there.

2:46:15.340 --> 2:46:18.100
 And then she leans in and she starts like sucking

2:46:18.100 --> 2:46:19.900
 over my ear, not actually touching me,

2:46:19.900 --> 2:46:22.620
 but like close to it, like with her mouth.

2:46:22.620 --> 2:46:23.780
 And it was really unpleasant.

2:46:23.780 --> 2:46:24.780
 I was like, whoa, can you stop?

2:46:24.780 --> 2:46:25.820
 She's like, no, no, no, there's something there.

2:46:25.820 --> 2:46:26.660
 I need to get it.

2:46:26.660 --> 2:46:27.780
 And I was like, no, no, no, I really don't like it.

2:46:27.780 --> 2:46:29.140
 Please, this is really loud.

2:46:29.140 --> 2:46:31.100
 She's like, I need to just bear with me.

2:46:31.100 --> 2:46:31.940
 And she does it.

2:46:31.940 --> 2:46:33.700
 And I don't know how long, for a few minutes.

2:46:33.700 --> 2:46:36.500
 And then she eventually collapses on the ground,

2:46:36.500 --> 2:46:38.540
 like freezing cold, crying.

2:46:40.580 --> 2:46:42.700
 And I'm just like, I don't know what the hell is going on.

2:46:42.700 --> 2:46:44.300
 Like I'm like thoroughly freaked out

2:46:44.300 --> 2:46:45.420
 as is everyone else watching.

2:46:45.420 --> 2:46:46.340
 Just like, what the hell?

2:46:46.340 --> 2:46:47.700
 And we like warm her up and she was like,

2:46:47.700 --> 2:46:51.340
 oh, what, oh, you know, she was really shaken up.

2:46:51.340 --> 2:46:54.700
 And she's like, I don't know what that,

2:46:54.700 --> 2:46:57.580
 she said it was something very unpleasant and dark.

2:46:57.580 --> 2:46:58.700
 Don't worry, it's gone.

2:46:58.700 --> 2:46:59.900
 I think you'll be fine in a couple,

2:46:59.900 --> 2:47:01.420
 you'll have the physical symptoms for a couple of weeks

2:47:01.420 --> 2:47:02.700
 and you'll be fine.

2:47:02.700 --> 2:47:05.740
 But, you know, she was just like that, you know,

2:47:05.740 --> 2:47:10.020
 so I was so rattled, A, because the potential that actually

2:47:10.020 --> 2:47:13.100
 I'd had something bad in me that made someone feel bad

2:47:13.100 --> 2:47:15.340
 and that she was scared.

2:47:15.340 --> 2:47:16.500
 That was what, you know, I was like, wait,

2:47:16.500 --> 2:47:19.300
 I thought you do this, this is the thing.

2:47:19.300 --> 2:47:20.340
 Now you're terrified.

2:47:20.340 --> 2:47:22.540
 Like you bought like some kind of exorcism or something.

2:47:22.540 --> 2:47:24.620
 Like what the fuck is going on?

2:47:24.620 --> 2:47:29.620
 So it, like just the most insane experience.

2:47:29.700 --> 2:47:31.740
 And frankly, it took me like a few months

2:47:31.740 --> 2:47:35.380
 to sort of emotionally recover from it.

2:47:35.380 --> 2:47:39.540
 But my ear problem went away about a couple of weeks later

2:47:39.540 --> 2:47:42.940
 and touch wood, I've not had any issues since.

2:47:42.940 --> 2:47:43.780
 So.

2:47:44.740 --> 2:47:48.140
 That gives you like hints

2:47:48.140 --> 2:47:50.140
 that maybe there's something out there.

2:47:51.060 --> 2:47:53.340
 I mean, I don't, again,

2:47:53.340 --> 2:47:55.180
 I don't have an explanation for this.

2:47:55.180 --> 2:47:57.820
 The most probable explanation was, you know,

2:47:57.820 --> 2:47:59.860
 I was a burning man, I was in a very open state.

2:47:59.860 --> 2:48:01.820
 Let's just leave it at that.

2:48:01.820 --> 2:48:06.820
 And, you know, placebo is an incredibly powerful thing

2:48:08.060 --> 2:48:10.300
 and a very not understood thing.

2:48:10.300 --> 2:48:11.140
 So.

2:48:11.140 --> 2:48:13.740
 Almost assigning the word placebo to it reduces it down

2:48:13.740 --> 2:48:16.500
 to a way that it doesn't deserve to be reduced down.

2:48:16.500 --> 2:48:19.180
 Maybe there's a whole science of what we call placebo.

2:48:19.180 --> 2:48:21.540
 Maybe there's a, placebo's a door.

2:48:21.540 --> 2:48:24.020
 Self healing, you know?

2:48:24.020 --> 2:48:26.380
 And I mean, I don't know what the problem was.

2:48:26.380 --> 2:48:27.700
 Like I was told it was many years.

2:48:27.700 --> 2:48:29.500
 I don't want to say I definitely had that

2:48:29.500 --> 2:48:30.700
 because I don't want people to think that,

2:48:30.700 --> 2:48:32.220
 oh, that's how, you know, if they do have that,

2:48:32.220 --> 2:48:33.180
 because it's a terrible disease.

2:48:33.180 --> 2:48:34.020
 And if they have that,

2:48:34.020 --> 2:48:35.100
 that this is going to be a guaranteed way for it

2:48:35.100 --> 2:48:35.940
 to fix it for them.

2:48:35.940 --> 2:48:37.740
 I don't know.

2:48:37.740 --> 2:48:39.740
 And I also don't, I don't,

2:48:39.740 --> 2:48:41.060
 and you're absolutely right to say,

2:48:41.060 --> 2:48:43.380
 like using even the word placebo is like,

2:48:43.380 --> 2:48:48.020
 it comes with this like baggage of, of like frame.

2:48:48.020 --> 2:48:49.980
 And I don't want to reduce it down.

2:48:49.980 --> 2:48:52.900
 All I can do is describe the experience and what happened.

2:48:52.900 --> 2:48:56.580
 I cannot put an ontological framework around it.

2:48:56.580 --> 2:49:00.100
 I can't say why it happened, what the mechanism was,

2:49:00.100 --> 2:49:02.980
 what the problem even was in the first place.

2:49:02.980 --> 2:49:05.220
 I just know that something crazy happened

2:49:05.220 --> 2:49:07.060
 and it was while I was in an open state.

2:49:07.060 --> 2:49:09.540
 And fortunately for me, it made the problem go away.

2:49:09.540 --> 2:49:11.860
 But what I took away from it, again,

2:49:11.860 --> 2:49:13.580
 it was part of this, you know,

2:49:13.580 --> 2:49:16.020
 this took me on this journey of becoming more humble

2:49:16.020 --> 2:49:17.500
 about what I think I know.

2:49:17.500 --> 2:49:18.860
 Because as I said before, I was like,

2:49:18.860 --> 2:49:21.740
 I was in the like Richard Dawkins train of atheism

2:49:21.740 --> 2:49:23.380
 in terms of there is no God.

2:49:23.380 --> 2:49:24.820
 And everything like that is bullshit.

2:49:24.820 --> 2:49:26.660
 We know everything, we know, you know,

2:49:26.660 --> 2:49:28.980
 the only way we can get through,

2:49:28.980 --> 2:49:30.820
 we know how medicine works and its molecules

2:49:30.820 --> 2:49:33.980
 and chemical interactions and that kind of stuff.

2:49:33.980 --> 2:49:36.580
 And now it's like, okay, well,

2:49:36.580 --> 2:49:39.540
 there's clearly more for us to understand.

2:49:40.820 --> 2:49:43.540
 And that doesn't mean that it's ascientific as well,

2:49:43.540 --> 2:49:47.140
 because, you know, the beauty of the scientific method

2:49:47.140 --> 2:49:49.940
 is that it still can apply to this situation.

2:49:49.940 --> 2:49:51.340
 Like, I don't see why, you know,

2:49:51.340 --> 2:49:54.300
 I would like to try and test this experimentally.

2:49:54.300 --> 2:49:55.540
 I haven't really, like, you know,

2:49:55.540 --> 2:49:57.100
 I don't know how we would go about doing that.

2:49:57.100 --> 2:49:58.860
 We'd have to find other people with the same condition,

2:49:58.860 --> 2:50:02.820
 I guess, and like, try and repeat the experiment.

2:50:04.220 --> 2:50:06.980
 But it doesn't, just because something happens

2:50:06.980 --> 2:50:09.180
 that's sort of out of the realms

2:50:09.180 --> 2:50:10.100
 of our current understanding,

2:50:10.100 --> 2:50:11.940
 it doesn't mean that it's,

2:50:11.940 --> 2:50:13.820
 the scientific method can't be used for it.

2:50:13.820 --> 2:50:17.900
 Yeah, I think the scientific method sits on a foundation

2:50:17.900 --> 2:50:20.220
 of those kinds of experiences,

2:50:20.220 --> 2:50:23.380
 because the scientific method is a process

2:50:24.660 --> 2:50:29.660
 to carve away at the mystery all around us.

2:50:30.980 --> 2:50:33.740
 And experiences like this is just a reminder

2:50:33.740 --> 2:50:36.700
 that we're mostly shrouded in mystery still.

2:50:36.700 --> 2:50:37.540
 That's it.

2:50:37.540 --> 2:50:38.940
 It's just like a humility.

2:50:38.940 --> 2:50:41.580
 Like, we haven't really figured this whole thing out.

2:50:41.580 --> 2:50:44.500
 But at the same time, we have found ways

2:50:44.500 --> 2:50:47.500
 to act, you know, we're clearly doing something right,

2:50:47.500 --> 2:50:50.020
 because think of the technological scientific advancements,

2:50:50.020 --> 2:50:53.980
 the knowledge that we have that would blow people's minds

2:50:53.980 --> 2:50:55.620
 even from 100 years ago.

2:50:55.620 --> 2:50:58.660
 Yeah, and we've even allegedly got out to space

2:50:58.660 --> 2:51:01.220
 and landed on the moon, although I still haven't,

2:51:01.220 --> 2:51:04.340
 I have not seen evidence of the Earth being round,

2:51:04.340 --> 2:51:06.560
 but I'm keeping an open mind.

2:51:08.140 --> 2:51:10.380
 Speaking of which, you studied physics

2:51:10.380 --> 2:51:15.380
 and astrophysics, just to go to that,

2:51:16.860 --> 2:51:20.940
 just to jump around through the fascinating life you've had,

2:51:20.940 --> 2:51:23.620
 when did you, how did that come to be?

2:51:23.620 --> 2:51:25.860
 Like, when did you fall in love with astronomy

2:51:25.860 --> 2:51:28.580
 and space and things like this?

2:51:28.580 --> 2:51:30.460
 As early as I can remember.

2:51:30.460 --> 2:51:33.380
 I was very lucky that my mom, and my dad,

2:51:33.380 --> 2:51:38.300
 but particularly my mom, my mom is like the most nature,

2:51:38.300 --> 2:51:41.220
 she is Mother Earth, is the only way to describe her.

2:51:41.220 --> 2:51:44.540
 Just, she's like Dr. Doolittle, animals flock to her

2:51:44.540 --> 2:51:47.100
 and just like sit and look at her adoringly.

2:51:47.100 --> 2:51:48.380
 As she sings.

2:51:48.380 --> 2:51:51.060
 Yeah, she just is Mother Earth,

2:51:51.060 --> 2:51:53.500
 and she has always been fascinated by,

2:51:54.540 --> 2:51:57.100
 she doesn't have any, she never went to university

2:51:57.100 --> 2:51:59.380
 or anything like that, she's actually phobic of maths,

2:51:59.380 --> 2:52:00.860
 if I try and get her to like,

2:52:00.860 --> 2:52:03.860
 you know, I was trying to teach her poker and she hated it.

2:52:03.860 --> 2:52:06.840
 But she's so deeply curious,

2:52:06.840 --> 2:52:09.880
 and that just got instilled in me when, you know,

2:52:09.880 --> 2:52:11.200
 we would sleep out under the stars,

2:52:11.200 --> 2:52:13.160
 whenever it was, you know, the two nights a year

2:52:13.160 --> 2:52:15.760
 when it was warm enough in the UK to do that.

2:52:15.760 --> 2:52:18.680
 And we would just lie out there until we fell asleep,

2:52:18.680 --> 2:52:20.920
 looking at, looking for satellites,

2:52:20.920 --> 2:52:24.320
 looking for shooting stars, and I was just always,

2:52:24.320 --> 2:52:25.320
 I don't know whether it was from that,

2:52:25.320 --> 2:52:30.320
 but I've always naturally gravitated to like the biggest,

2:52:30.440 --> 2:52:31.960
 the biggest questions.

2:52:31.960 --> 2:52:35.520
 And also the like, the most layers of abstraction I love,

2:52:35.520 --> 2:52:36.720
 just like, what's the meta question?

2:52:36.720 --> 2:52:38.800
 What's the meta question and so on.

2:52:38.800 --> 2:52:40.800
 So I think it just came from that really.

2:52:40.800 --> 2:52:43.760
 And then on top of that, like physics,

2:52:43.760 --> 2:52:45.880
 you know, it also made logical sense

2:52:45.880 --> 2:52:50.880
 in that it was a degree that,

2:52:51.240 --> 2:52:53.800
 well, a subject that ticks the box of being,

2:52:53.800 --> 2:52:55.520
 you know, answering these really big picture questions,

2:52:55.520 --> 2:52:57.840
 but it was also extremely useful.

2:52:57.840 --> 2:53:00.920
 It like has a very high utility in terms of,

2:53:00.920 --> 2:53:02.080
 I didn't know necessarily,

2:53:02.080 --> 2:53:04.400
 I thought I was gonna become like a research scientist.

2:53:04.400 --> 2:53:05.240
 My original plan was,

2:53:05.240 --> 2:53:07.040
 I wanna be a professional astronomer.

2:53:07.040 --> 2:53:08.640
 So it's not just like a philosophy degree

2:53:08.640 --> 2:53:10.400
 that asks the big questions,

2:53:10.400 --> 2:53:14.440
 and it's not like biology and the path

2:53:14.440 --> 2:53:16.160
 to go to medical school or something like that,

2:53:16.160 --> 2:53:19.200
 which is all overly pragmatic, not overly,

2:53:19.200 --> 2:53:23.760
 is very pragmatic, but this is, yeah,

2:53:23.760 --> 2:53:26.480
 physics is a good combination of the two.

2:53:26.480 --> 2:53:27.920
 Yeah, at least for me, it made sense.

2:53:27.920 --> 2:53:30.160
 And I was good at it, I liked it.

2:53:30.160 --> 2:53:32.440
 Yeah, I mean, it wasn't like I did an immense amount

2:53:32.440 --> 2:53:34.320
 of soul searching to choose it or anything.

2:53:34.320 --> 2:53:38.160
 It just was like this, it made the most sense.

2:53:38.160 --> 2:53:41.240
 I mean, you have to make this decision in the UK age 17,

2:53:41.240 --> 2:53:43.640
 which is crazy, because, you know, in US,

2:53:43.640 --> 2:53:46.240
 you go the first year, you do a bunch of stuff, right?

2:53:46.240 --> 2:53:48.520
 And then you choose your major.

2:53:48.520 --> 2:53:50.000
 Yeah, I think the first few years of college,

2:53:50.000 --> 2:53:53.080
 you focus on the drugs and only as you get closer

2:53:53.080 --> 2:53:56.360
 to the end, do you start to think, oh shit,

2:53:56.360 --> 2:53:57.440
 this wasn't about that.

2:53:57.440 --> 2:54:01.380
 And I owe the government a lot of money.

2:54:01.380 --> 2:54:05.180
 How many alien civilizations are out there?

2:54:05.180 --> 2:54:07.580
 When you looked up at the stars with your mom

2:54:07.580 --> 2:54:11.820
 and you were counting them, what's your mom think

2:54:11.820 --> 2:54:13.980
 about the number of alien civilizations?

2:54:13.980 --> 2:54:15.780
 I actually don't know.

2:54:15.780 --> 2:54:18.500
 I would imagine she would take the viewpoint of,

2:54:18.500 --> 2:54:21.300
 you know, she's pretty humble and she knows how many,

2:54:21.300 --> 2:54:24.100
 she knows there's a huge number of potential spawn sites

2:54:24.100 --> 2:54:25.380
 out there, so she would.

2:54:25.380 --> 2:54:26.220
 Spawn sites?

2:54:26.220 --> 2:54:27.540
 Spawn sites, yeah.

2:54:27.540 --> 2:54:29.500
 You know, this is all spawn sites.

2:54:29.500 --> 2:54:30.780
 Yeah, spawn sites in Polytopia.

2:54:30.780 --> 2:54:33.020
 We spawned on Earth, you know, it's.

2:54:33.020 --> 2:54:35.860
 Hmm, yeah, spawn sites.

2:54:35.860 --> 2:54:39.260
 Why does that feel weird to say spawn?

2:54:39.260 --> 2:54:44.260
 Because it makes me feel like there's only one source

2:54:44.860 --> 2:54:47.420
 of life and it's spawning in different locations.

2:54:47.420 --> 2:54:49.220
 That's why the word spawn.

2:54:49.220 --> 2:54:52.580
 Because it feels like life that originated on Earth

2:54:52.580 --> 2:54:54.700
 really originated here.

2:54:54.700 --> 2:54:58.780
 Right, it is unique to this particular.

2:54:58.780 --> 2:55:02.600
 Yeah, I mean, but I don't, in my mind, it doesn't exclude,

2:55:02.600 --> 2:55:04.380
 you know, the completely different forms of life

2:55:04.380 --> 2:55:09.160
 and different biochemical soups can't also spawn,

2:55:09.160 --> 2:55:12.580
 but I guess it implies that there's some spark

2:55:12.580 --> 2:55:16.180
 that is uniform, which I kind of like the idea of.

2:55:16.180 --> 2:55:19.220
 And then I get to think about respawning,

2:55:19.220 --> 2:55:23.500
 like after it dies, like what happens if life on Earth ends?

2:55:23.500 --> 2:55:26.140
 Is it gonna restart again?

2:55:26.140 --> 2:55:28.060
 Probably not, it depends.

2:55:28.060 --> 2:55:28.900
 Maybe Earth is too.

2:55:28.900 --> 2:55:30.460
 It depends on the type of, you know,

2:55:30.460 --> 2:55:32.820
 what's the thing that kills it off, right?

2:55:32.820 --> 2:55:36.100
 If it's a paperclip maximizer, not for the example,

2:55:36.100 --> 2:55:39.640
 but, you know, some kind of very self replicating,

2:55:40.820 --> 2:55:44.380
 high on the capabilities, very low on the wisdom type thing.

2:55:44.380 --> 2:55:47.420
 So whether that's, you know, gray goo, green goo,

2:55:47.420 --> 2:55:51.180
 you know, like nanobots or just a shitty misaligned AI

2:55:51.180 --> 2:55:54.360
 that thinks it needs to turn everything into paperclips.

2:55:54.360 --> 2:55:57.680
 You know, if it's something like that,

2:55:57.680 --> 2:55:59.040
 then it's gonna be very hard for life,

2:55:59.040 --> 2:56:02.080
 you know, complex life, because by definition,

2:56:02.080 --> 2:56:03.160
 you know, a paperclip maximizer

2:56:03.160 --> 2:56:05.680
 is the ultimate instantiation of molecule.

2:56:05.680 --> 2:56:08.620
 Deeply low complexity, over optimization on a single thing,

2:56:08.620 --> 2:56:11.120
 sacrificing everything else, turning the whole world into.

2:56:11.120 --> 2:56:12.200
 Although something tells me,

2:56:12.200 --> 2:56:14.640
 like if we actually take a paperclip maximizer,

2:56:14.640 --> 2:56:16.180
 it destroys everything.

2:56:16.180 --> 2:56:19.200
 It's a really dumb system that just envelops

2:56:19.200 --> 2:56:20.760
 the whole of Earth.

2:56:20.760 --> 2:56:22.360
 And the universe beyond, yeah.

2:56:22.360 --> 2:56:26.600
 Oh, I didn't know that part, but okay, great.

2:56:26.600 --> 2:56:27.440
 That's the thought experiment.

2:56:27.440 --> 2:56:30.280
 So it becomes a multi planetary paperclip maximizer?

2:56:30.280 --> 2:56:31.760
 Well, it just propagates.

2:56:31.760 --> 2:56:33.640
 I mean, it depends whether it figures out

2:56:33.640 --> 2:56:35.040
 how to jump the vacuum gap.

2:56:36.720 --> 2:56:38.640
 But again, I mean, this is all silly

2:56:38.640 --> 2:56:40.280
 because it's a hypothetical thought experiment,

2:56:40.280 --> 2:56:41.200
 which I think doesn't actually have

2:56:41.200 --> 2:56:43.240
 much practical application to the AI safety problem,

2:56:43.240 --> 2:56:45.240
 but it's just a fun thing to play around with.

2:56:45.240 --> 2:56:47.780
 But if by definition, it is maximally intelligent,

2:56:47.780 --> 2:56:50.200
 which means it is maximally good at

2:56:50.200 --> 2:56:53.080
 navigating the environment around it

2:56:53.080 --> 2:56:54.720
 in order to achieve its goal,

2:56:54.720 --> 2:56:58.000
 but extremely bad at choosing goals in the first place.

2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:00.000
 So again, we're talking on this orthogonality thing, right?

2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:03.720
 It's very low on wisdom, but very high on capability.

2:57:03.720 --> 2:57:05.680
 Then it will figure out how to jump the vacuum gap

2:57:05.680 --> 2:57:07.400
 between planets and stars and so on,

2:57:07.400 --> 2:57:09.900
 and thus just turn every atom it gets its hands on

2:57:09.900 --> 2:57:10.960
 into paperclips.

2:57:10.960 --> 2:57:12.800
 Yeah, by the way, for people who don't.

2:57:12.800 --> 2:57:14.600
 Which is maximum virality, by the way.

2:57:14.600 --> 2:57:16.240
 That's what virality is.

2:57:16.240 --> 2:57:18.540
 But does not mean that virality is necessarily

2:57:18.540 --> 2:57:20.040
 all about maximizing paperclips.

2:57:20.040 --> 2:57:21.080
 In that case, it is.

2:57:21.080 --> 2:57:22.280
 So for people who don't know,

2:57:22.280 --> 2:57:24.280
 this is just a thought experiment example

2:57:24.280 --> 2:57:27.360
 of an AI system that's very, that has a goal

2:57:27.360 --> 2:57:30.400
 and is willing to do anything to accomplish that goal,

2:57:30.400 --> 2:57:32.280
 including destroying all life on Earth

2:57:32.280 --> 2:57:36.320
 and all human life and all of consciousness in the universe

2:57:36.320 --> 2:57:40.720
 for the goal of producing a maximum number of paperclips.

2:57:40.720 --> 2:57:41.560
 Okay.

2:57:41.560 --> 2:57:43.960
 Or whatever its optimization function was

2:57:43.960 --> 2:57:45.000
 that it was set at.

2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:45.840
 But don't you think?

2:57:45.840 --> 2:57:47.920
 It could be making, recreating Lexus.

2:57:47.920 --> 2:57:50.600
 Maybe it'll tile the universe in Lex.

2:57:50.600 --> 2:57:51.640
 Go on.

2:57:51.640 --> 2:57:52.480
 I like this idea.

2:57:52.480 --> 2:57:53.320
 No, I'm just kidding.

2:57:53.320 --> 2:57:54.800
 That's better.

2:57:54.800 --> 2:57:56.240
 That's more interesting than paperclips.

2:57:56.240 --> 2:57:57.680
 That could be infinitely optimal

2:57:57.680 --> 2:57:58.520
 if I were to say it to myself.

2:57:58.520 --> 2:58:00.400
 But if you ask me, it's still a bad thing

2:58:00.400 --> 2:58:02.780
 because it's permanently capping

2:58:02.780 --> 2:58:04.200
 what the universe could ever be.

2:58:04.200 --> 2:58:05.880
 It's like, that's its end state.

2:58:05.880 --> 2:58:07.840
 Or achieving the optimal

2:58:07.840 --> 2:58:09.240
 that the universe could ever achieve.

2:58:09.240 --> 2:58:10.320
 But that's up to,

2:58:10.320 --> 2:58:12.480
 different people have different perspectives.

2:58:12.480 --> 2:58:15.520
 But don't you think within the paperclip world

2:58:15.520 --> 2:58:19.320
 that would emerge, just like in the zeros and ones

2:58:19.320 --> 2:58:20.200
 that make up a computer,

2:58:20.200 --> 2:58:22.880
 that would emerge beautiful complexities?

2:58:23.760 --> 2:58:27.820
 Like, it won't suppress, you know,

2:58:27.820 --> 2:58:30.500
 as you scale to multiple planets and throughout,

2:58:30.500 --> 2:58:33.280
 there'll emerge these little worlds

2:58:33.280 --> 2:58:38.140
 that on top of the fabric of maximizing paperclips,

2:58:38.140 --> 2:58:42.880
 there will be, that would emerge like little societies

2:58:42.880 --> 2:58:45.880
 of paperclip.

2:58:45.880 --> 2:58:47.520
 Well, then we're not describing

2:58:47.520 --> 2:58:48.600
 a paperclip maximizer anymore.

2:58:48.600 --> 2:58:51.600
 Because by the, like, if you think of what a paperclip is,

2:58:51.600 --> 2:58:55.600
 it is literally just a piece of bent iron, right?

2:58:55.600 --> 2:58:58.960
 So if it's maximizing that throughout the universe,

2:58:58.960 --> 2:59:01.040
 it's taking every atom it gets its hand on

2:59:01.040 --> 2:59:04.240
 into somehow turning it into iron or steel.

2:59:04.240 --> 2:59:05.400
 And then bending it into that shape

2:59:05.400 --> 2:59:06.800
 and then done and done.

2:59:06.800 --> 2:59:08.880
 By definition, like paperclips,

2:59:08.880 --> 2:59:11.960
 there is no way for, well, okay.

2:59:11.960 --> 2:59:13.920
 So you're saying that paperclips somehow

2:59:13.920 --> 2:59:17.960
 will just emerge and create through gravity or something.

2:59:17.960 --> 2:59:18.800
 Well, no, no, no.

2:59:18.800 --> 2:59:21.600
 Because there's a dynamic element to the whole system.

2:59:21.600 --> 2:59:24.720
 It's not just, it's creating those paperclips

2:59:24.720 --> 2:59:27.900
 and the act of creating, there's going to be a process.

2:59:27.900 --> 2:59:30.640
 And that process will have a dance to it.

2:59:30.640 --> 2:59:32.640
 Because it's not like sequential thing.

2:59:32.640 --> 2:59:35.240
 There's a whole complex three dimensional system

2:59:35.240 --> 2:59:37.760
 of paperclips, you know, like, you know,

2:59:37.760 --> 2:59:39.400
 people like string theory, right?

2:59:39.400 --> 2:59:40.920
 It's supposed to be strings that are interacting

2:59:40.920 --> 2:59:41.960
 in fascinating ways.

2:59:41.960 --> 2:59:44.520
 I'm sure paperclips are very string like,

2:59:44.520 --> 2:59:46.520
 they can be interacting in very interesting ways

2:59:46.520 --> 2:59:50.040
 as you scale exponentially through three dimensional.

2:59:50.040 --> 2:59:53.840
 I mean, I'm sure the paperclip maximizer

2:59:53.840 --> 2:59:55.680
 has to come up with a theory of everything.

2:59:55.680 --> 2:59:58.320
 It has to create like wormholes, right?

2:59:58.320 --> 3:00:01.040
 It has to break, like,

3:00:01.040 --> 3:00:02.680
 it has to understand quantum mechanics.

3:00:02.680 --> 3:00:03.520
 It has to understand general relativity.

3:00:03.520 --> 3:00:04.840
 I love your optimism.

3:00:04.840 --> 3:00:06.240
 This is where I'd say this,

3:00:06.240 --> 3:00:08.400
 we're going into the realm of pathological optimism

3:00:08.400 --> 3:00:09.360
 where if I, it's.

3:00:09.360 --> 3:00:12.800
 I'm sure there'll be a,

3:00:12.800 --> 3:00:14.880
 I think there's an intelligence

3:00:14.880 --> 3:00:16.320
 that emerges from that system.

3:00:16.320 --> 3:00:18.480
 So you're saying that basically intelligence

3:00:18.480 --> 3:00:21.680
 is inherent in the fabric of reality and will find a way.

3:00:21.680 --> 3:00:23.880
 Kind of like Goldblum says, life will find a way.

3:00:23.880 --> 3:00:25.240
 You think life will find a way

3:00:25.240 --> 3:00:29.520
 even out of this perfectly homogenous dead soup.

3:00:29.520 --> 3:00:31.600
 It's not perfectly homogenous.

3:00:31.600 --> 3:00:34.960
 It has to, it's perfectly maximal in the production.

3:00:34.960 --> 3:00:37.400
 I don't know why people keep thinking it's homogenous.

3:00:37.400 --> 3:00:39.560
 It maximizes the number of paperclips.

3:00:39.560 --> 3:00:40.400
 That's the only thing.

3:00:40.400 --> 3:00:42.040
 It's not trying to be homogenous.

3:00:42.040 --> 3:00:42.880
 It's trying.

3:00:42.880 --> 3:00:44.760
 It's trying to maximize paperclips.

3:00:44.760 --> 3:00:47.840
 So you're saying, you're saying that because it,

3:00:47.840 --> 3:00:50.160
 because, you know, kind of like in the Big Bang

3:00:50.160 --> 3:00:52.200
 or, you know, it seems like, you know, things,

3:00:52.200 --> 3:00:54.880
 there were clusters, there was more stuff here than there.

3:00:54.880 --> 3:00:56.600
 That was enough of the patternicity

3:00:56.600 --> 3:00:58.440
 that kickstarted the evolutionary process.

3:00:58.440 --> 3:01:01.280
 It's the little weirdness that will make it beautiful.

3:01:01.280 --> 3:01:02.120
 So yeah.

3:01:02.120 --> 3:01:03.000
 Complexity emerges.

3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:04.200
 Interesting, okay.

3:01:04.200 --> 3:01:05.600
 Well, so how does that line up then

3:01:05.600 --> 3:01:08.080
 with the whole heat death of the universe, right?

3:01:08.080 --> 3:01:10.080
 Cause that's another sort of instantiation of this.

3:01:10.080 --> 3:01:13.200
 It's like everything becomes so far apart and so cold

3:01:13.200 --> 3:01:18.200
 and so perfectly mixed that it's like homogenous grayness.

3:01:20.360 --> 3:01:23.280
 Do you think that even out of that homogenous grayness

3:01:23.280 --> 3:01:26.880
 where there's no, you know, negative entropy,

3:01:26.880 --> 3:01:30.880
 that, you know, there's no free energy that we understand

3:01:30.880 --> 3:01:33.920
 even from that new stuff?

3:01:33.920 --> 3:01:36.560
 Yeah, the paperclip maximizer

3:01:36.560 --> 3:01:38.120
 or any other intelligence systems

3:01:38.120 --> 3:01:40.960
 will figure out ways to travel to other universes

3:01:40.960 --> 3:01:43.480
 to create Big Bangs within those universes

3:01:43.480 --> 3:01:46.120
 or through black holes to create whole other worlds

3:01:46.120 --> 3:01:49.840
 to break the, what we consider are the limitations

3:01:49.840 --> 3:01:50.680
 of physics.

3:01:52.720 --> 3:01:56.640
 The paperclip maximizer will find a way if a way exists.

3:01:56.640 --> 3:01:59.000
 And we should be humbled to realize that we don't.

3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:01.440
 Yeah, but because it just wants to make more paperclips.

3:02:01.440 --> 3:02:02.640
 So it's gonna go into those universes

3:02:02.640 --> 3:02:03.760
 and turn them into paperclips.

3:02:03.760 --> 3:02:07.480
 Yeah, but we humans, not humans,

3:02:07.480 --> 3:02:10.320
 but complex system exists on top of that.

3:02:10.320 --> 3:02:11.880
 We're not interfering with it.

3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:17.360
 This complexity emerges from the simple base state.

3:02:17.360 --> 3:02:18.280
 The simple base.

3:02:18.280 --> 3:02:20.280
 Whether it's, yeah, whether it's, you know,

3:02:20.280 --> 3:02:22.640
 plank lengths or paperclips as the base unit.

3:02:22.640 --> 3:02:25.720
 Yeah, you can think of like the universe

3:02:25.720 --> 3:02:28.920
 as a paperclip maximizer because it's doing some dumb stuff.

3:02:28.920 --> 3:02:31.320
 Like physics seems to be pretty dumb.

3:02:31.320 --> 3:02:34.120
 It has, like, I don't know if you can summarize it.

3:02:34.120 --> 3:02:37.360
 Yeah, the laws are fairly basic

3:02:37.360 --> 3:02:39.640
 and yet out of them amazing complexity emerges.

3:02:39.640 --> 3:02:43.440
 And its goals seem to be pretty basic and dumb.

3:02:43.440 --> 3:02:45.280
 If you can summarize its goals,

3:02:45.280 --> 3:02:47.600
 I mean, I don't know what's a nice way maybe,

3:02:49.480 --> 3:02:52.400
 maybe laws of thermodynamics could be good.

3:02:52.400 --> 3:02:55.080
 I don't know if you can assign goals to physics,

3:02:55.080 --> 3:02:57.960
 but if you formulate in the sense of goals,

3:02:57.960 --> 3:03:00.840
 it's very similar to paperclip maximizing

3:03:00.840 --> 3:03:02.960
 in the dumbness of the goals.

3:03:02.960 --> 3:03:06.520
 But the pockets of complexity as it emerge

3:03:06.520 --> 3:03:07.960
 is where beauty emerges.

3:03:07.960 --> 3:03:09.120
 That's where life emerges.

3:03:09.120 --> 3:03:12.120
 That's where intelligence, that's where humans emerge.

3:03:12.120 --> 3:03:14.000
 And I think we're being very down

3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:16.240
 on this whole paperclip maximizer thing.

3:03:16.240 --> 3:03:17.680
 Now, the reason we hated it.

3:03:17.680 --> 3:03:19.000
 I think, yeah, because what you're saying

3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:24.000
 is that you think that the force of emergence itself

3:03:24.160 --> 3:03:27.480
 is another like unwritten, not unwritten,

3:03:27.480 --> 3:03:31.800
 but like another baked in law of reality.

3:03:31.800 --> 3:03:35.200
 And you're trusting that emergence will find a way to,

3:03:35.200 --> 3:03:38.720
 even out of seemingly the most mollusky,

3:03:38.720 --> 3:03:42.200
 awful, plain outcome, emergence will still find a way.

3:03:42.200 --> 3:03:43.440
 I love that as a philosophy.

3:03:43.440 --> 3:03:44.320
 I think it's very nice.

3:03:44.320 --> 3:03:47.280
 I would wield it carefully

3:03:47.280 --> 3:03:50.440
 because there's large error bars on that

3:03:50.440 --> 3:03:52.040
 and the certainty of that.

3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:55.920
 How about we build the paperclip maximizer and find out.

3:03:55.920 --> 3:03:56.840
 Classic, yeah.

3:03:56.840 --> 3:03:59.120
 Moloch is doing cartwheels, man.

3:03:59.120 --> 3:03:59.960
 Yeah.

3:03:59.960 --> 3:04:02.440
 But the thing is it will destroy humans in the process,

3:04:02.440 --> 3:04:05.320
 which is the reason we really don't like it.

3:04:05.320 --> 3:04:07.240
 We seem to be really holding on

3:04:07.240 --> 3:04:10.240
 to this whole human civilization thing.

3:04:10.240 --> 3:04:13.840
 Would that make you sad if AI systems that are beautiful,

3:04:13.840 --> 3:04:15.680
 that are conscious, that are interesting

3:04:15.680 --> 3:04:17.320
 and complex and intelligent,

3:04:18.160 --> 3:04:20.040
 ultimately lead to the death of humans?

3:04:20.040 --> 3:04:21.080
 Would that make you sad?

3:04:21.080 --> 3:04:23.000
 If humans led to the death of humans?

3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:23.840
 Sorry.

3:04:23.840 --> 3:04:25.520
 Like if they would supersede humans.

3:04:25.520 --> 3:04:26.840
 Oh, if some AI?

3:04:26.840 --> 3:04:30.320
 Yeah, AI would end humans.

3:04:30.320 --> 3:04:32.560
 I mean, that's the reason why I'm like,

3:04:32.560 --> 3:04:36.440
 in some ways less emotionally concerned about AI risk

3:04:36.440 --> 3:04:39.480
 than say, bio risk.

3:04:39.480 --> 3:04:42.200
 Because at least with AI, there's a chance,

3:04:42.200 --> 3:04:44.120
 you know, if we're in this hypothetical

3:04:44.120 --> 3:04:45.640
 where it wipes out humans,

3:04:45.640 --> 3:04:48.240
 but it does it for some like higher purpose,

3:04:48.240 --> 3:04:51.040
 it needs our atoms and energy to do something.

3:04:51.040 --> 3:04:53.120
 At least now the universe is going on

3:04:53.120 --> 3:04:55.240
 to do something interesting,

3:04:55.240 --> 3:04:56.760
 whereas if it wipes everything, you know,

3:04:56.760 --> 3:05:00.120
 bio like just kills everything on earth and that's it.

3:05:00.120 --> 3:05:01.440
 And there's no more, you know,

3:05:01.440 --> 3:05:03.320
 earth cannot spawn anything more meaningful

3:05:03.320 --> 3:05:05.960
 in the few hundred million years it has left,

3:05:05.960 --> 3:05:07.720
 because it doesn't have much time left.

3:05:09.040 --> 3:05:13.480
 Then, yeah, I don't know.

3:05:13.480 --> 3:05:16.120
 So one of my favorite books I've ever read is,

3:05:16.120 --> 3:05:19.920
 Novocene by James Lovelock, who sadly just died.

3:05:19.920 --> 3:05:22.080
 He wrote it when he was like 99.

3:05:22.080 --> 3:05:25.560
 He died aged 102, so it's a fairly new book.

3:05:25.560 --> 3:05:27.000
 And he sort of talks about that,

3:05:27.000 --> 3:05:29.240
 that he thinks it's, you know,

3:05:29.240 --> 3:05:30.800
 sort of building off this Gaia theory

3:05:30.800 --> 3:05:32.920
 where like earth is like living,

3:05:34.320 --> 3:05:36.080
 some form of intelligence itself,

3:05:36.080 --> 3:05:38.360
 and that this is the next like step, right?

3:05:38.360 --> 3:05:41.720
 Is this, whatever this new intelligence

3:05:41.720 --> 3:05:43.360
 that is maybe silicon based

3:05:43.360 --> 3:05:46.120
 as opposed to carbon based goes on to do.

3:05:46.120 --> 3:05:48.280
 And it's a really sort of, in some ways an optimistic,

3:05:48.280 --> 3:05:49.800
 but really fatalistic book.

3:05:49.800 --> 3:05:52.400
 And I don't know if I fully subscribed to it,

3:05:52.400 --> 3:05:54.400
 but it's a beautiful piece to read anyway.

3:05:54.400 --> 3:05:56.760
 So am I sad by that idea?

3:05:56.760 --> 3:05:57.920
 I think so, yes.

3:05:57.920 --> 3:05:59.240
 And actually, yeah, this is the reason

3:05:59.240 --> 3:06:00.120
 why I'm sad by the idea,

3:06:00.120 --> 3:06:02.520
 because if something is truly brilliant

3:06:02.520 --> 3:06:05.600
 and wise and smart and truly super intelligent,

3:06:06.440 --> 3:06:09.320
 it should be able to figure out abundance.

3:06:09.320 --> 3:06:11.720
 So if it figures out abundance,

3:06:11.720 --> 3:06:12.800
 it shouldn't need to kill us off.

3:06:12.800 --> 3:06:14.360
 It should be able to find a way for us.

3:06:14.360 --> 3:06:17.440
 It should be, there's plenty, the universe is huge.

3:06:17.440 --> 3:06:19.920
 There should be plenty of space for it to go out

3:06:19.920 --> 3:06:21.760
 and do all the things it wants to do,

3:06:21.760 --> 3:06:23.440
 and like give us a little pocket

3:06:23.440 --> 3:06:24.880
 where we can continue doing our things

3:06:24.880 --> 3:06:27.400
 and we can continue to do things and so on.

3:06:27.400 --> 3:06:28.920
 And again, if it's so supremely wise,

3:06:28.920 --> 3:06:29.760
 it shouldn't even be worried

3:06:29.760 --> 3:06:31.920
 about the game theoretic considerations

3:06:31.920 --> 3:06:33.000
 that by leaving us alive,

3:06:33.000 --> 3:06:35.120
 we'll then go and create another like super intelligent agent

3:06:35.120 --> 3:06:36.600
 that it then has to compete against,

3:06:36.600 --> 3:06:38.280
 because it should be only wise and smart enough

3:06:38.280 --> 3:06:40.680
 to not have to concern itself with that.

3:06:40.680 --> 3:06:44.680
 Unless it deems humans to be kind of assholes.

3:06:44.680 --> 3:06:48.680
 Like the humans are a source of non

3:06:48.680 --> 3:06:50.880
 of a lose, lose kind of dynamics.

3:06:51.880 --> 3:06:55.440
 Well, yes and no, we're not,

3:06:55.440 --> 3:06:57.600
 Moloch is, that's why I think it's important to separate.

3:06:57.600 --> 3:07:00.200
 But maybe humans are the source of Moloch.

3:07:00.200 --> 3:07:02.600
 No, I think, I mean, I think game theory

3:07:02.600 --> 3:07:03.800
 is the source of Moloch.

3:07:03.800 --> 3:07:05.560
 And, you know, because Moloch exists

3:07:05.560 --> 3:07:08.000
 in nonhuman systems as well.

3:07:08.000 --> 3:07:10.560
 It happens within like agents within a game

3:07:10.560 --> 3:07:13.920
 in terms of like, you know, it applies to agents,

3:07:13.920 --> 3:07:15.640
 but like it can apply to, you know,

3:07:17.400 --> 3:07:20.640
 a species that's on an island of animals,

3:07:20.640 --> 3:07:22.680
 you know, rats out competing,

3:07:22.680 --> 3:07:25.520
 the ones that like massively consume all the resources

3:07:25.520 --> 3:07:26.840
 are the ones that are gonna win out

3:07:26.840 --> 3:07:29.680
 over the more like chill, socialized ones.

3:07:29.680 --> 3:07:31.520
 And so, you know, creates this Malthusian trap,

3:07:31.520 --> 3:07:34.480
 like Moloch exists in little pockets in nature as well.

3:07:34.480 --> 3:07:35.960
 So it's not a strictly human thing.

3:07:35.960 --> 3:07:38.320
 I wonder if it's actually a result of consequences

3:07:38.320 --> 3:07:41.520
 of the invention of predator and prey dynamics.

3:07:41.520 --> 3:07:45.240
 Maybe it needs to, AI will have to kill off

3:07:45.240 --> 3:07:47.840
 every organism that's.

3:07:47.840 --> 3:07:50.240
 Now you're talking about killing off competition.

3:07:50.240 --> 3:07:55.240
 Not competition, but just like the way,

3:07:55.880 --> 3:07:59.960
 it's like the weeds or whatever

3:07:59.960 --> 3:08:01.640
 in a beautiful flower garden.

3:08:01.640 --> 3:08:02.480
 Parasites.

3:08:02.480 --> 3:08:05.200
 The parasites, yeah, on the whole system.

3:08:05.200 --> 3:08:08.440
 Now, of course, it won't do that completely.

3:08:08.440 --> 3:08:10.520
 It'll put them in a zoo like we do with parasites.

3:08:10.520 --> 3:08:11.360
 It'll ring fence.

3:08:11.360 --> 3:08:13.120
 Yeah, and there'll be somebody doing a PhD

3:08:13.120 --> 3:08:15.800
 on like they'll prod humans with a stick

3:08:15.800 --> 3:08:16.840
 and see what they do.

3:08:18.880 --> 3:08:22.400
 But I mean, in terms of letting us run wild

3:08:22.400 --> 3:08:25.080
 outside of the, you know, a geographically

3:08:25.080 --> 3:08:26.840
 constrained region that might be,

3:08:27.760 --> 3:08:31.200
 that it might decide to against that.

3:08:31.200 --> 3:08:33.160
 No, I think there's obviously the capacity

3:08:33.160 --> 3:08:38.160
 for beauty and kindness and non Moloch behavior

3:08:38.160 --> 3:08:41.440
 amidst humans, so I'm pretty sure AI will preserve us.

3:08:42.440 --> 3:08:46.240
 Let me, I don't know if you answered the aliens question.

3:08:46.240 --> 3:08:47.080
 No, I didn't.

3:08:47.080 --> 3:08:49.600
 You had a good conversation with Toby Orr.

3:08:49.600 --> 3:08:50.440
 Yes.

3:08:50.440 --> 3:08:52.200
 About various sides of the universe.

3:08:52.200 --> 3:08:54.680
 I think, did he say, now I'm forgetting,

3:08:54.680 --> 3:08:58.160
 but I think he said it's a good chance we're alone.

3:08:58.160 --> 3:09:02.200
 So the classic, you know, Fermi paradox question is,

3:09:02.200 --> 3:09:07.200
 there are so many spawn points and yet, you know,

3:09:09.200 --> 3:09:12.080
 it didn't take us that long to go from harnessing fire

3:09:12.080 --> 3:09:15.120
 to sending out radio signals into space.

3:09:15.120 --> 3:09:18.640
 So surely given the vastness of space we should be,

3:09:18.640 --> 3:09:20.720
 and you know, even if only a tiny fraction of those

3:09:20.720 --> 3:09:23.120
 create life and other civilizations too,

3:09:23.120 --> 3:09:24.840
 we should be, the universe should be very noisy.

3:09:24.840 --> 3:09:27.800
 There should be evidence of Dyson spheres or whatever,

3:09:27.800 --> 3:09:29.680
 you know, like at least radio signals and so on,

3:09:29.680 --> 3:09:32.520
 but seemingly things are very silent out there.

3:09:32.520 --> 3:09:33.800
 Now, of course, it depends on who you speak to.

3:09:33.800 --> 3:09:35.840
 Some people say that they're getting signals all the time

3:09:35.840 --> 3:09:37.480
 and so on and like, I don't wanna make

3:09:37.480 --> 3:09:38.640
 an epistemic statement on that,

3:09:38.640 --> 3:09:43.120
 but it seems like there's a lot of silence.

3:09:43.120 --> 3:09:45.680
 And so that raises this paradox.

3:09:45.680 --> 3:09:50.680
 And then say, you know, the Drake equation.

3:09:51.040 --> 3:09:55.120
 So the Drake equation is like basically just a simple thing

3:09:55.120 --> 3:09:57.720
 of like trying to estimate the number of possible

3:09:57.720 --> 3:09:58.960
 civilizations within the galaxy

3:09:58.960 --> 3:10:02.080
 by multiplying the number of stars created per year

3:10:02.080 --> 3:10:03.560
 by the number of stars that have planets,

3:10:03.560 --> 3:10:04.760
 planets that are habitable, blah, blah, blah.

3:10:04.760 --> 3:10:06.520
 So all these like different factors.

3:10:06.520 --> 3:10:09.240
 And then you plug in numbers into that and you, you know,

3:10:09.240 --> 3:10:11.400
 depending on like the range of, you know,

3:10:11.400 --> 3:10:14.680
 your lower bound and your upper bound point estimates

3:10:14.680 --> 3:10:16.800
 that you put in, you get out a number at the end

3:10:16.800 --> 3:10:18.520
 for the number of civilizations.

3:10:18.520 --> 3:10:22.840
 But what Toby and his crew did differently was,

3:10:22.840 --> 3:10:25.640
 Toby is a researcher at the Future of Humanity Institute.

3:10:25.640 --> 3:10:30.640
 They, instead of, they realized that it's like basically

3:10:31.160 --> 3:10:33.800
 a statistical quirk that if you put in point sources,

3:10:33.800 --> 3:10:34.840
 even if you think you're putting in

3:10:34.840 --> 3:10:36.000
 conservative point sources,

3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:37.960
 because on some of these variables,

3:10:37.960 --> 3:10:41.080
 the uncertainty is so large,

3:10:41.080 --> 3:10:43.800
 it spans like maybe even like a couple of hundred

3:10:43.800 --> 3:10:45.000
 orders of magnitude.

3:10:46.400 --> 3:10:47.440
 By putting in point sources,

3:10:47.440 --> 3:10:50.880
 it's always going to lead to overestimates.

3:10:50.880 --> 3:10:54.320
 And so they, like by putting stuff on a log scale,

3:10:54.320 --> 3:10:56.080
 or actually they did it on like a log log scale

3:10:56.080 --> 3:10:57.400
 on some of them,

3:10:57.400 --> 3:10:59.960
 and then like ran the simulation across the whole

3:11:01.080 --> 3:11:02.600
 bucket of uncertainty,

3:11:02.600 --> 3:11:04.320
 across all of those orders of magnitude.

3:11:04.320 --> 3:11:05.840
 When you do that,

3:11:05.840 --> 3:11:08.240
 then actually the number comes out much, much smaller.

3:11:08.240 --> 3:11:10.440
 And that's the more statistically rigorous,

3:11:10.440 --> 3:11:11.920
 you know, mathematically correct way

3:11:11.920 --> 3:11:13.360
 of doing the calculation.

3:11:13.360 --> 3:11:14.680
 It's still a lot of hand waving.

3:11:14.680 --> 3:11:17.640
 As science goes, it's like definitely, you know,

3:11:17.640 --> 3:11:19.840
 just waving, I don't know what an analogy is,

3:11:19.840 --> 3:11:22.040
 but it's hand wavy.

3:11:22.040 --> 3:11:24.720
 And anyway, when they did this,

3:11:24.720 --> 3:11:27.000
 and then they did a Bayesian update on it as well,

3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:30.120
 to like factor in the fact that there is no evidence

3:11:30.120 --> 3:11:31.320
 that we're picking up because, you know,

3:11:31.320 --> 3:11:33.920
 no evidence is actually a form of evidence, right?

3:11:33.920 --> 3:11:37.680
 And the long and short of it comes out that the,

3:11:37.680 --> 3:11:41.320
 we're roughly around 70% to be the only

3:11:42.480 --> 3:11:45.080
 intelligent civilization in our galaxy thus far,

3:11:45.080 --> 3:11:47.840
 and around 50, 50 in the entire observable universe,

3:11:47.840 --> 3:11:50.200
 which sounds so crazily counterintuitive,

3:11:50.200 --> 3:11:53.360
 but their math is legit.

3:11:53.360 --> 3:11:55.600
 Well, yeah, the math around this particular equation,

3:11:55.600 --> 3:11:57.760
 which the equation is ridiculous on many levels,

3:11:57.760 --> 3:12:02.760
 but the powerful thing about the equation

3:12:03.160 --> 3:12:05.200
 is there's the different things,

3:12:05.200 --> 3:12:09.400
 different components that can be estimated,

3:12:09.400 --> 3:12:13.800
 and the error bars on which can be reduced with science.

3:12:13.800 --> 3:12:17.320
 And hence throughout, since the equation came out,

3:12:17.320 --> 3:12:19.560
 the error bars have been coming out on different,

3:12:19.560 --> 3:12:20.920
 different aspects.

3:12:20.920 --> 3:12:23.600
 And so that, it almost kind of says,

3:12:23.600 --> 3:12:27.000
 what, like this gives you a mission to reduce the error bars

3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:30.000
 on these estimates over a period of time.

3:12:30.000 --> 3:12:32.760
 And once you do, you can better and better understand,

3:12:32.760 --> 3:12:34.720
 like in the process of redoing the error bars,

3:12:34.720 --> 3:12:36.960
 you'll get to understand actually

3:12:36.960 --> 3:12:41.480
 what is the right way to find out where the aliens are,

3:12:41.480 --> 3:12:43.960
 how many of them there are, and all those kinds of things.

3:12:43.960 --> 3:12:47.800
 So I don't think it's good to use that for an estimation.

3:12:47.800 --> 3:12:50.120
 I think you do have to think from like,

3:12:50.120 --> 3:12:51.840
 more like from first principles,

3:12:51.840 --> 3:12:53.880
 just looking at what life is on Earth,

3:12:55.320 --> 3:12:59.320
 and trying to understand the very physics based,

3:12:59.320 --> 3:13:04.240
 biology, chemistry, biology based question of what is life,

3:13:04.240 --> 3:13:05.960
 maybe computation based.

3:13:05.960 --> 3:13:07.920
 What the fuck is this thing?

3:13:07.920 --> 3:13:12.160
 And that, like how difficult is it to create this thing?

3:13:12.160 --> 3:13:14.520
 It's one way to say like how many planets like this

3:13:14.520 --> 3:13:16.160
 are out there, all that kind of stuff,

3:13:16.160 --> 3:13:20.560
 but it feels like from our very limited knowledge

3:13:20.560 --> 3:13:25.560
 perspective, the right way is to think how does,

3:13:25.680 --> 3:13:28.200
 what is this thing and how does it originate?

3:13:28.200 --> 3:13:32.000
 From very simple nonlife things,

3:13:32.000 --> 3:13:36.240
 how does complex lifelike things emerge?

3:13:37.120 --> 3:13:42.120
 From a rock to a bacteria, protein,

3:13:42.120 --> 3:13:46.400
 and these like weird systems that encode information

3:13:46.400 --> 3:13:49.520
 and pass information from self replicate,

3:13:49.520 --> 3:13:51.560
 and then also select each other and mutate

3:13:51.560 --> 3:13:53.440
 in interesting ways such that they can adapt

3:13:53.440 --> 3:13:56.560
 and evolve and build increasingly more complex systems.

3:13:56.560 --> 3:13:59.720
 Right, well it's a form of information processing, right?

3:13:59.720 --> 3:14:00.560
 Right.

3:14:00.560 --> 3:14:04.000
 Whereas information transfer, but then also

3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:07.440
 an energy processing, which then results in,

3:14:07.440 --> 3:14:09.080
 I guess information processing,

3:14:09.080 --> 3:14:09.920
 maybe I'm getting bogged down.

3:14:09.920 --> 3:14:12.560
 It's doing some modification and yeah,

3:14:12.560 --> 3:14:14.440
 the input is some energy.

3:14:14.440 --> 3:14:17.600
 Right, it's able to extract, yeah,

3:14:17.600 --> 3:14:20.640
 extract resources from its environment

3:14:20.640 --> 3:14:22.680
 in order to achieve a goal.

3:14:22.680 --> 3:14:24.920
 But the goal doesn't seem to be clear.

3:14:24.920 --> 3:14:29.440
 Right, well the goal is to make more of itself.

3:14:29.440 --> 3:14:33.760
 Yeah, but in a way that increases,

3:14:33.760 --> 3:14:36.320
 I mean I don't know if evolution

3:14:36.320 --> 3:14:39.840
 is a fundamental law of the universe,

3:14:39.840 --> 3:14:44.200
 but it seems to want to replicate itself

3:14:44.200 --> 3:14:47.640
 in a way that maximizes the chance of its survival.

3:14:47.640 --> 3:14:51.320
 Individual agents within an ecosystem do, yes, yes.

3:14:51.320 --> 3:14:53.280
 Evolution itself doesn't give a fuck.

3:14:53.280 --> 3:14:54.120
 Right.

3:14:54.120 --> 3:14:55.200
 It's a very, it don't care.

3:14:55.200 --> 3:14:58.480
 It's just like, oh, you optimize it.

3:14:58.480 --> 3:15:01.520
 Well, at least it's certainly, yeah,

3:15:01.520 --> 3:15:03.440
 it doesn't care about the welfare

3:15:03.440 --> 3:15:05.040
 of the individual agents within it,

3:15:05.040 --> 3:15:06.440
 but it does seem to, I don't know.

3:15:06.440 --> 3:15:09.680
 I think the mistake is that we're anthropomorphizing.

3:15:09.680 --> 3:15:13.440
 To even try and give evolution a mindset

3:15:14.760 --> 3:15:17.200
 because it is, there's a really great post

3:15:17.200 --> 3:15:21.440
 by Eliezer Yudkowsky on Lesrong,

3:15:21.440 --> 3:15:25.360
 which is an alien God.

3:15:25.360 --> 3:15:27.560
 And he talks about the mistake we make

3:15:27.560 --> 3:15:29.160
 when we try and put our mind,

3:15:30.080 --> 3:15:32.280
 think through things from an evolutionary perspective

3:15:32.280 --> 3:15:35.160
 as though giving evolution some kind of agency

3:15:35.160 --> 3:15:36.320
 and what it wants.

3:15:37.320 --> 3:15:39.520
 Yeah, worth reading, but yeah.

3:15:39.520 --> 3:15:42.600
 I would like to say that having interacted

3:15:42.600 --> 3:15:43.960
 with a lot of really smart people

3:15:43.960 --> 3:15:46.920
 that say that anthropomorphization is a mistake,

3:15:46.920 --> 3:15:48.720
 I would like to say that saying

3:15:48.720 --> 3:15:51.600
 that anthropomorphization is a mistake is a mistake.

3:15:51.600 --> 3:15:54.960
 I think there's a lot of power in anthropomorphization,

3:15:54.960 --> 3:15:57.720
 if I can only say that word correctly one time.

3:15:57.720 --> 3:16:00.760
 I think that's actually a really powerful way

3:16:00.760 --> 3:16:01.800
 to reason to things.

3:16:01.800 --> 3:16:04.320
 And I think people, especially people in robotics

3:16:04.320 --> 3:16:07.120
 seem to run away from it as fast as possible.

3:16:07.120 --> 3:16:09.280
 And I just, I think.

3:16:09.280 --> 3:16:12.200
 Can you give an example of like how it helps in robotics?

3:16:13.160 --> 3:16:18.160
 Oh, in that our world is a world of humans

3:16:19.040 --> 3:16:23.320
 and to see robots as fundamentally just tools

3:16:24.200 --> 3:16:27.960
 runs away from the fact that we live in a world,

3:16:27.960 --> 3:16:30.000
 a dynamic world of humans.

3:16:30.000 --> 3:16:32.080
 That like these, all these game theory systems

3:16:32.080 --> 3:16:35.440
 we've talked about, that a robot

3:16:35.440 --> 3:16:37.560
 that ever has to interact with humans.

3:16:37.560 --> 3:16:40.800
 And I don't mean like intimate friendship interaction.

3:16:40.800 --> 3:16:43.320
 I mean, in a factory setting where it has to deal

3:16:43.320 --> 3:16:45.520
 with the uncertainty of humans, all that kind of stuff.

3:16:45.520 --> 3:16:49.840
 You have to acknowledge that the robot's behavior

3:16:49.840 --> 3:16:53.360
 has an effect on the human, just as much as the human

3:16:53.360 --> 3:16:54.600
 has an effect on the robot.

3:16:54.600 --> 3:16:56.120
 And there's a dance there.

3:16:56.120 --> 3:16:58.400
 And you have to realize that this entity,

3:16:58.400 --> 3:17:01.680
 when a human sees a robot, this is obvious

3:17:01.680 --> 3:17:04.240
 in a physical manifestation of a robot,

3:17:04.240 --> 3:17:05.800
 they feel a certain way.

3:17:05.800 --> 3:17:07.920
 They have a fear, they have uncertainty.

3:17:07.920 --> 3:17:11.880
 They have their own personal life projections.

3:17:11.880 --> 3:17:13.240
 We have to have pets and dogs

3:17:13.240 --> 3:17:14.840
 and the thing looks like a dog.

3:17:14.840 --> 3:17:17.120
 They have their own memories of what a dog is like.

3:17:17.120 --> 3:17:19.760
 They have certain feelings and that's gonna be useful

3:17:19.760 --> 3:17:22.240
 in a safety setting, safety critical setting,

3:17:22.240 --> 3:17:25.280
 which is one of the most trivial settings for a robot

3:17:25.280 --> 3:17:29.240
 in terms of how to avoid any kind of dangerous situations.

3:17:29.240 --> 3:17:32.520
 And a robot should really consider that

3:17:32.520 --> 3:17:34.880
 in navigating its environment.

3:17:34.880 --> 3:17:38.760
 And we humans are right to reason about how a robot

3:17:38.760 --> 3:17:41.480
 should consider navigating its environment

3:17:41.480 --> 3:17:42.840
 through anthropomorphization.

3:17:42.840 --> 3:17:46.520
 I also think our brains are designed to think

3:17:46.520 --> 3:17:51.520
 in human terms, like game theory,

3:17:55.320 --> 3:18:00.320
 I think is best applied in the space of human decisions.

3:18:01.680 --> 3:18:03.440
 And so...

3:18:03.440 --> 3:18:06.160
 Right, you're dealing, I mean, with things like AI,

3:18:06.160 --> 3:18:10.520
 AI is, they are, we can somewhat,

3:18:10.520 --> 3:18:11.960
 like, I don't think it's,

3:18:11.960 --> 3:18:14.160
 the reason I say anthropomorphization

3:18:14.160 --> 3:18:17.000
 we need to be careful with is because there is a danger

3:18:17.000 --> 3:18:20.840
 of overly applying, overly wrongly assuming

3:18:20.840 --> 3:18:24.200
 that this artificial intelligence is going to operate

3:18:24.200 --> 3:18:25.880
 in any similar way to us,

3:18:25.880 --> 3:18:27.760
 because it is operating

3:18:27.760 --> 3:18:29.680
 on a fundamentally different substrate.

3:18:29.680 --> 3:18:33.880
 Like even dogs or even mice or whatever, in some ways,

3:18:33.880 --> 3:18:37.520
 like anthropomorphizing them is less of a mistake, I think,

3:18:37.520 --> 3:18:40.200
 than an AI, even though it's an AI we built and so on,

3:18:40.200 --> 3:18:41.440
 because at least we know

3:18:41.440 --> 3:18:43.360
 that they're running from the same substrate.

3:18:43.360 --> 3:18:45.560
 And they've also evolved from the same,

3:18:45.560 --> 3:18:48.680
 out of the same evolutionary process.

3:18:48.680 --> 3:18:50.000
 They've followed this evolution

3:18:50.000 --> 3:18:52.400
 of like needing to compete for resources

3:18:52.400 --> 3:18:55.200
 and needing to find a mate and that kind of stuff.

3:18:55.200 --> 3:18:58.280
 Whereas an AI that has just popped into existence

3:18:58.280 --> 3:19:00.480
 somewhere on like a cloud server,

3:19:00.480 --> 3:19:02.840
 let's say, you know, or whatever, however it runs

3:19:02.840 --> 3:19:03.920
 and whatever, whether it,

3:19:03.920 --> 3:19:05.560
 I don't know whether they have an internal experience.

3:19:05.560 --> 3:19:07.040
 I don't think they necessarily do.

3:19:07.040 --> 3:19:08.120
 In fact, I don't think they do.

3:19:08.120 --> 3:19:11.920
 But the point is, is that to try and apply

3:19:11.920 --> 3:19:14.880
 any kind of modeling of like thinking through problems

3:19:14.880 --> 3:19:16.920
 and decisions in the same way that we do

3:19:16.920 --> 3:19:19.720
 has to be done extremely carefully because they are,

3:19:20.720 --> 3:19:23.560
 like, they're so alien,

3:19:23.560 --> 3:19:26.320
 their method of whatever their form of thinking is,

3:19:26.320 --> 3:19:29.160
 it's just so different because they've never had to evolve,

3:19:29.160 --> 3:19:30.640
 you know, in the same way.

3:19:30.640 --> 3:19:32.280
 Yeah, beautifully put.

3:19:32.280 --> 3:19:33.760
 I was just playing devil's advocate.

3:19:33.760 --> 3:19:35.680
 I do think in certain contexts,

3:19:35.680 --> 3:19:37.920
 anthropomorphization is not gonna hurt you.

3:19:37.920 --> 3:19:38.760
 Yes.

3:19:38.760 --> 3:19:39.960
 Engineers run away from it too fast.

3:19:39.960 --> 3:19:41.040
 I can see that.

3:19:41.040 --> 3:19:43.680
 But from the most point, you're right.

3:19:43.680 --> 3:19:48.680
 Do you have advice for young people today,

3:19:48.680 --> 3:19:51.360
 like the 17 year old that you were,

3:19:51.360 --> 3:19:53.600
 of how to live life?

3:19:53.600 --> 3:19:56.440
 You can be proud of how to have a career

3:19:56.440 --> 3:19:59.960
 you can be proud of in this world full of mullocks.

3:20:00.880 --> 3:20:02.440
 Think about the win wins.

3:20:02.440 --> 3:20:04.640
 Look for win win situations.

3:20:05.520 --> 3:20:10.520
 And be careful not to, you know, overly use your smarts

3:20:11.320 --> 3:20:13.000
 to convince yourself that something is win win

3:20:13.000 --> 3:20:13.840
 when it's not.

3:20:13.840 --> 3:20:14.680
 So that's difficult.

3:20:14.680 --> 3:20:17.600
 And I don't know how to advise, you know, people on that

3:20:17.600 --> 3:20:20.160
 because it's something I'm still figuring out myself.

3:20:20.160 --> 3:20:23.920
 But have that as a sort of default MO.

3:20:25.760 --> 3:20:28.080
 Don't see things, everything as a zero sum game.

3:20:28.080 --> 3:20:30.680
 Try to find the positive sumness and like find ways

3:20:30.680 --> 3:20:32.680
 if there doesn't seem to be one,

3:20:32.680 --> 3:20:34.200
 consider playing a different game.

3:20:34.200 --> 3:20:35.720
 So that I would suggest that.

3:20:37.000 --> 3:20:38.760
 Do not become a professional poker player.

3:20:38.760 --> 3:20:41.800
 I, cause people always ask that like, oh, she's a pro.

3:20:41.800 --> 3:20:43.240
 I wanna do that too.

3:20:43.240 --> 3:20:45.280
 Fine, you could have done it if you were, you know,

3:20:45.280 --> 3:20:46.240
 when I started out,

3:20:46.240 --> 3:20:48.280
 it was a very different situation back then.

3:20:48.280 --> 3:20:52.600
 Poker is, you know, a great game to learn

3:20:52.600 --> 3:20:54.960
 in order to understand the ways to think.

3:20:54.960 --> 3:20:56.800
 And I recommend people learn it,

3:20:56.800 --> 3:20:58.400
 but don't try and make a living from it these days.

3:20:58.400 --> 3:21:00.280
 It's almost, it's very, very difficult

3:21:00.280 --> 3:21:01.880
 to the point of being impossible.

3:21:03.640 --> 3:21:08.640
 And then really, really be aware of how much time

3:21:08.800 --> 3:21:12.120
 you spend on your phone and on social media

3:21:12.120 --> 3:21:14.280
 and really try and keep it to a minimum.

3:21:14.280 --> 3:21:17.040
 Be aware that basically every moment that you spend on it

3:21:17.040 --> 3:21:18.120
 is bad for you.

3:21:18.120 --> 3:21:20.160
 So it doesn't mean to say you can never do it,

3:21:20.160 --> 3:21:22.520
 but just have that running in the background.

3:21:22.520 --> 3:21:25.280
 I'm doing a bad thing for myself right now.

3:21:25.280 --> 3:21:27.120
 I think that's the general rule of thumb.

3:21:28.680 --> 3:21:31.160
 Of course, about becoming a professional poker player,

3:21:31.160 --> 3:21:35.400
 if there is a thing in your life that's like that

3:21:35.400 --> 3:21:38.680
 and nobody can convince you otherwise, just fucking do it.

3:21:40.960 --> 3:21:42.680
 Don't listen to anyone's advice.

3:21:44.080 --> 3:21:46.360
 Find a thing that you can't be talked out of too.

3:21:46.360 --> 3:21:47.360
 That's a thing.

3:21:47.360 --> 3:21:48.520
 I like that, yeah.

3:21:50.160 --> 3:21:53.880
 You were a lead guitarist in a metal band?

3:21:53.880 --> 3:21:54.720
 Oh.

3:21:54.720 --> 3:21:56.960
 Did I write that down from something?

3:21:56.960 --> 3:22:00.080
 What did you, what'd you do it for?

3:22:00.080 --> 3:22:05.080
 The performing, was it the pure, the music of it?

3:22:07.080 --> 3:22:08.960
 Was it just being a rock star?

3:22:08.960 --> 3:22:09.960
 Why'd you do it?

3:22:11.440 --> 3:22:15.400
 So we only ever played two gigs.

3:22:15.400 --> 3:22:17.880
 We didn't last, you know, it wasn't a very,

3:22:17.880 --> 3:22:20.560
 we weren't famous or anything like that.

3:22:20.560 --> 3:22:25.280
 But I was very into metal.

3:22:25.280 --> 3:22:27.440
 Like it was my entire identity,

3:22:27.440 --> 3:22:29.320
 sort of from the age of 16 to 23.

3:22:29.320 --> 3:22:31.640
 What's the best metal band of all time?

3:22:31.640 --> 3:22:33.840
 Don't ask me that, it's so hard to answer.

3:22:36.760 --> 3:22:39.800
 So I know I had a long argument with,

3:22:40.800 --> 3:22:43.960
 I'm a guitarist, more like a classic rock guitarist.

3:22:43.960 --> 3:22:46.600
 So, you know, I've had friends who are very big

3:22:46.600 --> 3:22:49.800
 Pantera fans and so there was often arguments

3:22:49.800 --> 3:22:52.480
 about what's the better metal band,

3:22:52.480 --> 3:22:53.880
 Metallica versus Pantera.

3:22:53.880 --> 3:22:57.360
 This is a more kind of 90s maybe discussion.

3:22:57.360 --> 3:22:59.400
 But I was always on the side of Metallica,

3:23:00.360 --> 3:23:02.760
 both musically and in terms of performance

3:23:02.760 --> 3:23:06.120
 and the depth of lyrics and so on.

3:23:06.120 --> 3:23:10.280
 So, but they were, basically everybody was against me.

3:23:10.280 --> 3:23:12.280
 Because if you're a true metal fan,

3:23:12.280 --> 3:23:14.520
 I guess the idea goes is you can't possibly

3:23:14.520 --> 3:23:16.160
 be a Metallica fan.

3:23:16.160 --> 3:23:19.560
 Because Metallica is pop, it's just like, they sold out.

3:23:19.560 --> 3:23:20.600
 Metallica are metal.

3:23:20.600 --> 3:23:24.920
 Like they were the, I mean, again, you can't say

3:23:24.920 --> 3:23:26.520
 who was the godfather of metal, blah, blah, blah.

3:23:26.520 --> 3:23:31.520
 But like they were so groundbreaking and so brilliant.

3:23:32.680 --> 3:23:34.920
 I mean, you've named literally two of my favorite bands.

3:23:34.920 --> 3:23:37.240
 Like when you asked that question, who are my favorites?

3:23:37.240 --> 3:23:39.000
 Like those were two that came up.

3:23:39.000 --> 3:23:41.480
 A third one is Children of Bodom,

3:23:41.480 --> 3:23:44.960
 who I just think, oh, they just tick all the boxes for me.

3:23:47.240 --> 3:23:48.160
 Yeah, I don't know.

3:23:48.160 --> 3:23:51.800
 It's nowadays, like I kind of sort of feel

3:23:51.800 --> 3:23:55.680
 like a repulsion to the, I was that myself.

3:23:55.680 --> 3:23:56.880
 Like I'd be like, who do you prefer more?

3:23:56.880 --> 3:23:58.880
 Come on, who's like, no, you have to rank them.

3:23:58.880 --> 3:24:01.720
 But it's like this false zero sumness that's like, why?

3:24:01.720 --> 3:24:02.600
 They're so additive.

3:24:02.600 --> 3:24:04.560
 Like there's no conflict there.

3:24:04.560 --> 3:24:06.960
 Although when people ask that kind of question

3:24:06.960 --> 3:24:11.440
 about anything, movies, I feel like it's hard work.

3:24:11.440 --> 3:24:14.880
 And it's unfair, but it's, you should pick one.

3:24:14.880 --> 3:24:17.760
 Like, and that's actually the same kind of,

3:24:17.760 --> 3:24:19.480
 it's like a fear of a commitment.

3:24:19.480 --> 3:24:21.040
 When people ask me, what's your favorite band?

3:24:21.040 --> 3:24:24.280
 It's like, but I, it's good to pick.

3:24:24.280 --> 3:24:25.120
 Exactly.

3:24:25.120 --> 3:24:27.640
 And thank you for the tough question, yeah.

3:24:27.640 --> 3:24:29.480
 Well, maybe not in the context

3:24:29.480 --> 3:24:31.800
 when a lot of people are listening.

3:24:31.800 --> 3:24:33.960
 Yeah, I'm not just like, what, why does it matter?

3:24:33.960 --> 3:24:35.560
 No, it does.

3:24:35.560 --> 3:24:37.400
 Are you still into metal?

3:24:37.400 --> 3:24:38.520
 Funny enough, I was listening to a bunch

3:24:38.520 --> 3:24:39.840
 before I came over here.

3:24:39.840 --> 3:24:43.680
 Oh, like, do you use it for like motivation

3:24:43.680 --> 3:24:44.640
 or it gets you in a certain?

3:24:44.640 --> 3:24:45.680
 Yeah, I was weirdly listening

3:24:45.680 --> 3:24:48.120
 to 80s hair metal before I came.

3:24:48.120 --> 3:24:49.840
 Does that count as metal?

3:24:49.840 --> 3:24:53.440
 I think so, it's like proto metal and it's happy.

3:24:53.440 --> 3:24:55.800
 It's optimistic, happy proto metal.

3:24:56.760 --> 3:25:00.040
 Yeah, I mean, all these genres bleed into each other.

3:25:00.040 --> 3:25:01.240
 But yeah, sorry, to answer your question

3:25:01.240 --> 3:25:04.280
 about guitar playing, my relationship with it

3:25:04.280 --> 3:25:09.120
 was kind of weird in that I was deeply uncreative.

3:25:09.120 --> 3:25:11.240
 My objective would be to hear some really hard

3:25:11.240 --> 3:25:14.320
 technical solo and then learn it, memorize it

3:25:14.320 --> 3:25:15.960
 and then play it perfectly.

3:25:15.960 --> 3:25:19.200
 But I was incapable of trying to write my own music.

3:25:19.200 --> 3:25:21.600
 Like the idea was just absolutely terrifying.

3:25:23.120 --> 3:25:24.640
 But I was also just thinking, I was like,

3:25:24.640 --> 3:25:28.600
 it'd be kind of cool to actually try starting a band again

3:25:28.600 --> 3:25:31.520
 and getting back into it and write.

3:25:31.520 --> 3:25:34.000
 But it's scary.

3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:34.840
 It's scary.

3:25:34.840 --> 3:25:36.840
 I mean, I put out some guitar playing

3:25:36.840 --> 3:25:38.120
 just other people's covers.

3:25:38.120 --> 3:25:41.440
 I play Comfortly Numb on the internet.

3:25:41.440 --> 3:25:42.480
 And it's scary too.

3:25:42.480 --> 3:25:44.200
 It's scary putting stuff out there.

3:25:45.320 --> 3:25:47.680
 And I had this similar kind of fascination

3:25:47.680 --> 3:25:50.280
 with technical playing, both on piano and guitar.

3:25:50.280 --> 3:25:52.120
 You know, one of the first,

3:25:55.680 --> 3:25:58.120
 one of the reasons that I started learning guitar

3:25:58.120 --> 3:26:01.760
 is from Ozzy Osbourne, Mr. Crowley's solo.

3:26:01.760 --> 3:26:04.360
 And one of the first solos I learned is that,

3:26:06.760 --> 3:26:07.600
 there's a beauty to it.

3:26:07.600 --> 3:26:08.440
 There's a lot of beauty to it.

3:26:08.440 --> 3:26:09.280
 It's tapping, right?

3:26:09.280 --> 3:26:13.520
 Yeah, there's some tapping, but it's just really fast.

3:26:14.480 --> 3:26:15.720
 Beautiful, like arpeggios.

3:26:15.720 --> 3:26:16.960
 Yeah, arpeggios, yeah.

3:26:16.960 --> 3:26:19.600
 But there's a melody that you can hear through it,

3:26:19.600 --> 3:26:21.600
 but there's also build up.

3:26:21.600 --> 3:26:22.800
 It's a beautiful solo,

3:26:22.800 --> 3:26:25.920
 but it's also technically just visually the way it looks

3:26:25.920 --> 3:26:29.640
 when a person's watching, you feel like a rockstar playing.

3:26:29.640 --> 3:26:32.120
 But it ultimately has to do with technical.

3:26:33.560 --> 3:26:36.440
 You're not developing the part of your brain

3:26:36.440 --> 3:26:40.640
 that I think requires you to generate beautiful music.

3:26:40.640 --> 3:26:42.360
 It is ultimately technical in nature.

3:26:42.360 --> 3:26:45.840
 And so that took me a long time to let go of that

3:26:45.840 --> 3:26:48.960
 and just be able to write music myself.

3:26:48.960 --> 3:26:53.120
 And that's a different journey, I think.

3:26:53.120 --> 3:26:55.080
 I think that journey is a little bit more inspired

3:26:55.080 --> 3:26:57.080
 in the blues world, for example,

3:26:57.080 --> 3:26:58.640
 where improvisation is more valued,

3:26:58.640 --> 3:26:59.960
 obviously in jazz and so on.

3:26:59.960 --> 3:27:04.960
 But I think ultimately it's a more rewarding journey

3:27:04.960 --> 3:27:08.360
 because you get your relationship with the guitar

3:27:08.360 --> 3:27:12.120
 then becomes a kind of escape from the world

3:27:12.120 --> 3:27:16.080
 where you can create, I mean, creating stuff is.

3:27:17.120 --> 3:27:18.720
 And it's something you work with,

3:27:18.720 --> 3:27:20.240
 because my relationship with my guitar was like,

3:27:20.240 --> 3:27:23.360
 it was something to tame and defeat.

3:27:23.360 --> 3:27:24.760
 Yeah, it's a challenge.

3:27:24.760 --> 3:27:26.960
 Which was kind of what my whole personality was back then.

3:27:26.960 --> 3:27:29.520
 I was just very like, as I said, very competitive,

3:27:29.520 --> 3:27:33.120
 very just like must bend this thing to my will.

3:27:33.120 --> 3:27:37.840
 Whereas writing music, it's like a dance, you work with it.

3:27:37.840 --> 3:27:39.880
 But I think because of the competitive aspect,

3:27:39.880 --> 3:27:42.440
 for me at least, that's still there,

3:27:42.440 --> 3:27:45.720
 which creates anxiety about playing publicly

3:27:45.720 --> 3:27:47.080
 or all that kind of stuff.

3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:49.280
 I think there's just like a harsh self criticism

3:27:49.280 --> 3:27:50.680
 within the whole thing.

3:27:50.680 --> 3:27:53.320
 It's really tough.

3:27:53.320 --> 3:27:55.320
 I wanna hear some of your stuff.

3:27:55.320 --> 3:27:59.240
 I mean, there's certain things that feel really personal.

3:27:59.240 --> 3:28:03.360
 And on top of that, as we talked about poker offline,

3:28:03.360 --> 3:28:05.560
 there's certain things that you get to a certain height

3:28:05.560 --> 3:28:07.160
 in your life, and that doesn't have to be very high,

3:28:07.160 --> 3:28:09.080
 but you get to a certain height

3:28:09.080 --> 3:28:11.760
 and then you put it aside for a bit.

3:28:11.760 --> 3:28:13.160
 And it's hard to return to it

3:28:13.160 --> 3:28:15.960
 because you remember being good.

3:28:15.960 --> 3:28:19.880
 And it's hard to, like you being at a very high level

3:28:19.880 --> 3:28:22.560
 in poker, it might be hard for you to return to poker

3:28:22.560 --> 3:28:24.600
 every once in a while and enjoy it,

3:28:24.600 --> 3:28:26.920
 knowing that you're just not as sharp as you used to be

3:28:26.920 --> 3:28:29.680
 because you're not doing it every single day.

3:28:29.680 --> 3:28:31.320
 That's something I always wonder with,

3:28:31.320 --> 3:28:33.760
 I mean, even just like in chess with Kasparov,

3:28:33.760 --> 3:28:36.200
 some of these greats, just returning to it,

3:28:36.200 --> 3:28:38.400
 it's almost painful.

3:28:38.400 --> 3:28:40.680
 And I feel that way with guitar too,

3:28:40.680 --> 3:28:44.160
 because I used to play every day a lot.

3:28:44.160 --> 3:28:46.080
 So returning to it is painful

3:28:46.080 --> 3:28:48.720
 because it's like accepting the fact

3:28:48.720 --> 3:28:51.480
 that this whole ride is finite

3:28:51.480 --> 3:28:55.760
 and that you have a prime,

3:28:55.760 --> 3:28:57.400
 there's a time when you were really good

3:28:57.400 --> 3:28:58.800
 and now it's over and now.

3:28:58.800 --> 3:29:00.360
 We're on a different chapter of life.

3:29:00.360 --> 3:29:02.960
 I was like, oh, but I miss that.

3:29:02.960 --> 3:29:06.560
 But you can still discover joy within that process.

3:29:06.560 --> 3:29:09.160
 It's been tough, especially with some level of like,

3:29:10.080 --> 3:29:13.680
 as people get to know you, and people film stuff,

3:29:13.680 --> 3:29:18.680
 you don't have the privacy of just sharing something

3:29:18.960 --> 3:29:20.600
 with a few people around you.

3:29:20.600 --> 3:29:21.600
 Yeah.

3:29:21.600 --> 3:29:23.080
 That's a beautiful privacy.

3:29:23.080 --> 3:29:23.920
 That's a good point.

3:29:23.920 --> 3:29:26.040
 With the internet, it's just disappearing.

3:29:26.040 --> 3:29:27.760
 Yeah, that's a really good point.

3:29:27.760 --> 3:29:29.160
 Yeah.

3:29:29.160 --> 3:29:31.120
 But all those pressures aside,

3:29:31.120 --> 3:29:32.920
 if you really, you can step up

3:29:32.920 --> 3:29:37.920
 and still enjoy the fuck out of a good musical performance.

3:29:39.120 --> 3:29:42.360
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

3:29:42.360 --> 3:29:43.600
 What's the meaning of life?

3:29:43.600 --> 3:29:45.600
 Oh, wow.

3:29:45.600 --> 3:29:47.320
 It's in your name, as we talked about.

3:29:47.320 --> 3:29:48.600
 You have to live up.

3:29:48.600 --> 3:29:50.960
 Do you feel the requirement

3:29:50.960 --> 3:29:54.200
 to have to live up to your name?

3:29:54.200 --> 3:29:55.200
 Because live?

3:29:55.200 --> 3:29:56.040
 Yeah.

3:29:56.040 --> 3:29:57.760
 No, because I don't see it.

3:29:57.760 --> 3:30:00.600
 I mean, my, oh, again, it's kind of like,

3:30:02.440 --> 3:30:03.280
 no, I don't know.

3:30:03.280 --> 3:30:05.320
 Because my full name is Olivia.

3:30:05.320 --> 3:30:06.160
 Yeah.

3:30:06.160 --> 3:30:07.200
 So I can retreat in that and be like,

3:30:07.200 --> 3:30:09.000
 oh, Olivia, what does that even mean?

3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:11.000
 Live up to live.

3:30:12.320 --> 3:30:13.880
 No, I can't say I do,

3:30:13.880 --> 3:30:15.400
 because I've never thought of it that way.

3:30:15.400 --> 3:30:17.280
 And then your name backwards is evil.

3:30:17.280 --> 3:30:18.880
 That's what we also talked about.

3:30:18.880 --> 3:30:21.880
 I mean, I feel the urge to live up to that,

3:30:21.880 --> 3:30:25.880
 to be the inverse of evil or even better.

3:30:25.880 --> 3:30:27.480
 Because I don't think, you know,

3:30:27.480 --> 3:30:29.000
 is the inverse of evil good

3:30:29.000 --> 3:30:32.000
 or is good something completely separate to that?

3:30:32.000 --> 3:30:34.040
 I think my intuition says it's the latter,

3:30:34.040 --> 3:30:34.880
 but I don't know.

3:30:34.880 --> 3:30:36.880
 Anyway, again, getting in the weeds.

3:30:36.880 --> 3:30:39.280
 What is the meaning of all this?

3:30:39.280 --> 3:30:40.120
 Of life.

3:30:41.240 --> 3:30:42.080
 Why are we here?

3:30:43.880 --> 3:30:44.720
 I think to,

3:30:44.720 --> 3:30:47.040
 explore, have fun and understand

3:30:48.080 --> 3:30:51.080
 and make more of here and to keep the game going.

3:30:51.080 --> 3:30:51.920
 Of here?

3:30:51.920 --> 3:30:52.760
 More of here?

3:30:52.760 --> 3:30:55.280
 More of this, whatever this is.

3:30:55.280 --> 3:30:57.240
 More of experience.

3:30:57.240 --> 3:30:58.240
 Just to have more of experience

3:30:58.240 --> 3:31:01.240
 and ideally positive experience.

3:31:01.240 --> 3:31:05.240
 And more complex, you know,

3:31:05.240 --> 3:31:06.840
 I guess, try and put it into a sort of

3:31:06.840 --> 3:31:08.240
 vaguely scientific term.

3:31:10.240 --> 3:31:11.080
 I don't know.

3:31:11.080 --> 3:31:11.920
 I don't know.

3:31:11.920 --> 3:31:12.760
 I don't know.

3:31:12.760 --> 3:31:17.760
 But make it so that the program required,

3:31:18.360 --> 3:31:21.480
 the length of code required to describe the universe

3:31:21.480 --> 3:31:22.680
 is as long as possible.

3:31:23.560 --> 3:31:27.120
 And, you know, highly complex and therefore interesting.

3:31:27.120 --> 3:31:28.960
 Because again, like,

3:31:28.960 --> 3:31:32.200
 I know, you know, we bang the metaphor to death,

3:31:32.200 --> 3:31:36.000
 but like, tiled with X, you know,

3:31:36.000 --> 3:31:37.880
 tiled with paperclips,

3:31:37.880 --> 3:31:41.120
 doesn't require that much of a code to describe.

3:31:41.120 --> 3:31:42.720
 Obviously, maybe something emerges from it,

3:31:42.720 --> 3:31:44.840
 but that steady state, assuming a steady state,

3:31:44.840 --> 3:31:45.680
 it's not very interesting.

3:31:45.680 --> 3:31:49.720
 Whereas it seems like our universe is over time

3:31:49.720 --> 3:31:51.960
 becoming more and more complex and interesting.

3:31:51.960 --> 3:31:54.000
 There's so much richness and beauty and diversity

3:31:54.000 --> 3:31:54.840
 on this earth.

3:31:54.840 --> 3:31:56.280
 And I want that to continue and get more.

3:31:56.280 --> 3:31:58.640
 I want more diversity.

3:31:58.640 --> 3:32:00.640
 And the very best sense of that word

3:32:01.880 --> 3:32:06.880
 is to me the goal of all this.

3:32:07.040 --> 3:32:07.880
 Yeah.

3:32:07.880 --> 3:32:10.880
 And somehow have fun in the process.

3:32:10.880 --> 3:32:12.120
 Yes.

3:32:12.120 --> 3:32:14.360
 Because we do create a lot of fun things along,

3:32:14.360 --> 3:32:18.000
 instead of in this creative force

3:32:18.000 --> 3:32:19.480
 and all the beautiful things we create,

3:32:19.480 --> 3:32:22.520
 somehow there's like a funness to it.

3:32:22.520 --> 3:32:25.160
 And perhaps that has to do with the finiteness of life,

3:32:25.160 --> 3:32:27.160
 the finiteness of all these experiences,

3:32:28.400 --> 3:32:30.400
 which is what makes them kind of unique.

3:32:31.360 --> 3:32:32.920
 Like the fact that they end,

3:32:32.920 --> 3:32:35.480
 there's this, whatever it is,

3:32:35.480 --> 3:32:40.480
 falling in love or creating a piece of art

3:32:40.480 --> 3:32:45.480
 or creating a bridge or creating a rocket

3:32:45.560 --> 3:32:48.880
 or creating a, I don't know,

3:32:48.880 --> 3:32:53.160
 just the businesses that build something

3:32:53.160 --> 3:32:56.160
 or solve something.

3:32:56.160 --> 3:32:59.200
 The fact that it is born and it dies

3:33:00.840 --> 3:33:05.840
 somehow embeds it with fun, with joy

3:33:07.040 --> 3:33:08.440
 for the people involved.

3:33:08.440 --> 3:33:09.920
 I don't know what that is.

3:33:09.920 --> 3:33:11.400
 The finiteness of it.

3:33:11.400 --> 3:33:12.240
 It can do.

3:33:12.240 --> 3:33:13.800
 Some people struggle with the,

3:33:13.800 --> 3:33:17.880
 I mean, a big thing I think that one has to learn

3:33:17.880 --> 3:33:21.120
 is being okay with things coming to an end.

3:33:21.120 --> 3:33:25.640
 And in terms of like projects and so on,

3:33:25.640 --> 3:33:27.120
 people cling onto things beyond

3:33:27.120 --> 3:33:28.520
 what they're meant to be doing,

3:33:28.520 --> 3:33:30.480
 beyond what is reasonable.

3:33:32.040 --> 3:33:33.880
 And I'm gonna have to come to terms

3:33:33.880 --> 3:33:35.800
 with this podcast coming to an end.

3:33:35.800 --> 3:33:37.080
 I really enjoyed talking to you.

3:33:37.080 --> 3:33:40.160
 I think it's obvious as we've talked about many times,

3:33:40.160 --> 3:33:41.360
 you should be doing a podcast.

3:33:41.360 --> 3:33:45.960
 You should, you're already doing a lot of stuff publicly

3:33:45.960 --> 3:33:47.360
 to the world, which is awesome.

3:33:47.360 --> 3:33:48.440
 And you're a great educator.

3:33:48.440 --> 3:33:49.280
 You're a great mind.

3:33:49.280 --> 3:33:50.280
 You're a great intellect.

3:33:50.280 --> 3:33:52.840
 But it's also this whole medium of just talking

3:33:52.840 --> 3:33:53.680
 is also fun.

3:33:53.680 --> 3:33:54.520
 It is good.

3:33:54.520 --> 3:33:55.360
 It's a fun one.

3:33:55.360 --> 3:33:56.200
 It really is good.

3:33:56.200 --> 3:33:58.840
 And it's just, it's nothing but like,

3:33:58.840 --> 3:34:00.560
 oh, it's just so much fun.

3:34:00.560 --> 3:34:03.160
 And you can just get into so many,

3:34:03.160 --> 3:34:05.240
 yeah, there's this space to just explore

3:34:05.240 --> 3:34:07.440
 and see what comes and emerges.

3:34:07.440 --> 3:34:08.280
 And yeah.

3:34:08.280 --> 3:34:09.320
 Yeah, to understand yourself better.

3:34:09.320 --> 3:34:10.320
 And if you're talking to others,

3:34:10.320 --> 3:34:12.560
 to understand them better and together with them.

3:34:12.560 --> 3:34:15.320
 I mean, you should do your own podcast,

3:34:15.320 --> 3:34:16.960
 but you should also do a podcast with C

3:34:16.960 --> 3:34:18.640
 as we've talked about.

3:34:18.640 --> 3:34:22.800
 The two of you have such different minds

3:34:22.800 --> 3:34:26.040
 that like melt together in just hilarious ways,

3:34:26.040 --> 3:34:29.320
 fascinating ways, just the tension of ideas there

3:34:29.320 --> 3:34:30.240
 is really powerful.

3:34:30.240 --> 3:34:33.200
 But in general, I think you got a beautiful voice.

3:34:33.200 --> 3:34:35.320
 So thank you so much for talking today.

3:34:35.320 --> 3:34:36.520
 Thank you for being a friend.

3:34:36.520 --> 3:34:39.320
 Thank you for honoring me with this conversation

3:34:39.320 --> 3:34:40.400
 and with your valuable time.

3:34:40.400 --> 3:34:41.240
 Thanks, Liv.

3:34:41.240 --> 3:34:42.560
 Thank you.

3:34:42.560 --> 3:34:45.160
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Liv Marie.

3:34:45.160 --> 3:34:46.280
 To support this podcast,

3:34:46.280 --> 3:34:48.800
 please check out our sponsors in the description.

3:34:48.800 --> 3:34:50.880
 And now let me leave you with some words

3:34:50.880 --> 3:34:52.040
 from Richard Feynman.

3:34:53.080 --> 3:34:56.240
 I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing

3:34:56.240 --> 3:34:59.280
 than to have answers, which might be wrong.

3:34:59.280 --> 3:35:01.800
 I have approximate answers and possible beliefs

3:35:01.800 --> 3:35:05.120
 and different degrees of uncertainty about different things,

3:35:05.120 --> 3:35:08.520
 but I'm not absolutely sure of anything.

3:35:08.520 --> 3:35:11.480
 And there are many things I don't know anything about,

3:35:11.480 --> 3:35:15.440
 such as whether it means anything to ask why we're here.

3:35:15.440 --> 3:35:17.560
 I don't have to know the answer.

3:35:17.560 --> 3:35:20.760
 I don't feel frightened not knowing things

3:35:20.760 --> 3:35:24.280
 by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose,

3:35:24.280 --> 3:35:27.520
 which is the way it really is as far as I can tell.

3:35:27.520 --> 3:35:30.840
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
