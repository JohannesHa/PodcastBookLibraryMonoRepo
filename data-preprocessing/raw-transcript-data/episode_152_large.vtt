00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
 The following is a conversation with Dan Gable

00:02.720 --> 00:04.440
 from two years ago.

00:04.440 --> 00:06.640
 I did not previously publish this conversation

00:06.640 --> 00:10.000
 as part of this podcast, but as a separate thing.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.600
 And as a result, it did not receive many listens.

00:13.600 --> 00:16.680
 Let me be honest and say that while I usually

00:16.680 --> 00:19.840
 don't care about how many listens or views something gets,

00:19.840 --> 00:23.580
 in this one case, I feel like I failed one of my heroes.

00:23.580 --> 00:25.280
 I feel I didn't properly introduce

00:25.280 --> 00:28.260
 a truly special human being to an audience

00:28.260 --> 00:31.400
 that might find him as inspiring as I did.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.980
 Dan Gable is one of the greatest

00:33.980 --> 00:36.300
 Olympic athletes of all time.

00:36.300 --> 00:39.320
 Bigger than records and medals, to many like myself,

00:39.320 --> 00:43.320
 he's a symbol of guts, spirit, mental toughness,

00:43.320 --> 00:45.420
 and relentless hard work.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.180
 As a wrestler, he was undefeated in high school,

00:48.180 --> 00:51.600
 undefeated in college until his very last match.

00:51.600 --> 00:55.560
 And having lost that match, he found another level

00:55.560 --> 00:58.800
 and became a world champion and an Olympic champion.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.040
 And most importantly, he did so

01:01.040 --> 01:03.440
 perfectly dominating his opponents.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.200
 He did not surrender a single point

01:05.200 --> 01:07.800
 at the 1972 Olympic games.

01:07.800 --> 01:12.360
 As a coach, he led the Iowa Hawkeyes to 15 national titles

01:12.360 --> 01:15.040
 and 25 consecutive Big Ten championships.

01:15.040 --> 01:19.840
 He coached 152 All Americans, 45 national champions,

01:19.840 --> 01:23.320
 106 Big Ten champions, and 12 Olympians,

01:23.320 --> 01:25.280
 including eight medalists.

01:25.280 --> 01:26.960
 He's the author of several books,

01:26.960 --> 01:29.840
 including A Wrestling Life One and Two,

01:29.840 --> 01:32.580
 and Coaching Wrestling Successfully.

01:32.580 --> 01:34.280
 Quick mention of our sponsors.

01:34.280 --> 01:38.100

01:54.560 --> 01:57.960
 As a side note, let me say that I spent a few days in Iowa

01:57.960 --> 02:00.320
 and got to attend a wrestling duel meet

02:00.320 --> 02:02.860
 in the historic Carver Hawkeye Arena.

02:02.860 --> 02:05.480
 Part of me wanted to stay in Iowa forever

02:05.480 --> 02:10.140
 to drill takedowns, to start a family, to live life simply.

02:10.140 --> 02:12.520
 Wrestling is one of the pure sports,

02:12.520 --> 02:14.920
 both beautiful and brutal,

02:14.920 --> 02:17.640
 where both mental toughness and technical mastery

02:17.640 --> 02:21.040
 of the highest form are rewarded with victory,

02:21.040 --> 02:23.960
 and everything else is punished with defeat.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.120
 And every such loss weighs heavy on the minds

02:26.120 --> 02:29.240
 of anyone who has ever stepped on the wrestling mat,

02:29.240 --> 02:31.000
 including myself.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.920
 The same is true for one of the greatest wrestlers

02:33.920 --> 02:35.400
 in history of the sport,

02:35.400 --> 02:38.200
 the man who graciously welcomed me into his home

02:38.200 --> 02:42.120
 for this conversation, the legend, Dan Gable.

02:51.920 --> 02:55.880
 And now, here's my conversation with Dan Gable.

02:56.880 --> 02:58.320
 You're persistent, I love that,

02:58.320 --> 02:59.920
 because you've been trying to get me on this podcast

02:59.920 --> 03:01.280
 for a long time.

03:01.280 --> 03:04.920
 And until I saw you on another podcast

03:04.920 --> 03:08.440
 and you said you were Russian, did I call you back?

03:08.440 --> 03:09.400
 Then it was over.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.080
 Because Russia to me, you know,

03:11.080 --> 03:14.920
 is leading the world in wrestling almost every year.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.560
 What's the difference between American wrestling

03:16.560 --> 03:17.400
 and Russian wrestling?

03:17.400 --> 03:18.600
 You showed me this painting.

03:18.600 --> 03:20.640
 Well, it's MIT, it's science.

03:20.640 --> 03:21.480
 It's science.

03:21.480 --> 03:24.840
 And they really study the sport.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.120
 They're really good technically.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.680
 They're really, really good in strategy.

03:28.680 --> 03:32.120
 They don't really push like the real toughness.

03:32.120 --> 03:35.440
 They don't push like conditioning.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.760
 And so Americans, we need what they have.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.880
 Russians need what we have.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.680
 And when you get the two together.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.560
 And for me, why I could beat the Russians

03:46.560 --> 03:50.160
 is because I went their way a little bit.

03:50.160 --> 03:52.600
 But I kept my toughness.

03:52.600 --> 03:56.080
 But you're known, you're known for your toughness.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.880
 Yeah, but I wasn't known for my art.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.960
 I wasn't known for my science.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.960
 So when did you become a bit of an artist?

04:02.960 --> 04:04.720
 It took a loss.

04:04.720 --> 04:05.560
 The Larry Owens loss.

04:05.560 --> 04:07.680
 Most people thought I was already an artist

04:07.680 --> 04:11.440
 just because I won 181 straight matches in seven years.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.160
 And not just winning, but you know,

04:13.160 --> 04:16.040
 kind of punishing people.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.960
 And from that point of view,

04:17.960 --> 04:19.240
 yeah, I might've been pretty good,

04:19.240 --> 04:21.280
 but I had a long ways to go yet.

04:21.280 --> 04:23.640
 And I didn't really realize that,

04:23.640 --> 04:27.080
 or I should say, I didn't really know

04:27.080 --> 04:29.280
 how to get it out of me until I had a loss.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.480
 And then I realized I gotta buckle down,

04:31.480 --> 04:34.480
 learn some of that science, become more of an artist.

04:34.480 --> 04:35.520
 How do you become an artist?

04:35.520 --> 04:40.520
 So the Russian way has this drilling technique,

04:41.320 --> 04:42.720
 thousands of reps.

04:42.720 --> 04:46.680
 How do you think you work on the science, the art part?

04:46.680 --> 04:49.800
 You gotta study the best in the world.

04:49.800 --> 04:53.360
 I think Dave Schultz was our guy in America

04:53.360 --> 04:58.360
 that probably showed us that being artistic,

04:58.440 --> 04:59.440
 you needed that.

04:59.440 --> 05:00.400
 And he studied it.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.600
 He went over there as a high schooler

05:02.600 --> 05:04.920
 and rustled in some major tournaments over there.

05:04.920 --> 05:07.160
 And he saw their ways.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.920
 He used that Russian science

05:09.920 --> 05:12.680
 and then he was already an American

05:12.680 --> 05:15.960
 and he saw how I trained athletes.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.680
 He saw what I did in the Olympics,

05:17.680 --> 05:20.320
 saw what other people, how we held up,

05:20.320 --> 05:21.880
 and he applied that as well.

05:21.880 --> 05:25.120
 But I'd have to say he was more the artistic type.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.120
 He was more of a Russian than an American

05:27.120 --> 05:30.480
 when it came to wrestling.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.280
 You've coached 45 national champions,

05:33.280 --> 05:37.760
 106 Big Ten champions, and eight Olympic medalists,

05:37.760 --> 05:39.560
 which is incredible.

05:39.560 --> 05:42.640
 What is a common thread between them

05:42.640 --> 05:46.520
 and what are maybe some of the fundamental differences?

05:47.440 --> 05:50.480
 I think the common thread is that

05:53.640 --> 05:56.280
 they all had one of those two avenues

05:56.280 --> 05:57.480
 that we talked already

05:59.040 --> 06:02.120
 and because we intertwined them.

06:02.120 --> 06:05.360
 So in a Russian wrestling room, they got the same people.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.080
 Most of the time in an American wrestling room,

06:07.080 --> 06:08.520
 we had the same people.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.600
 But when I was out recruiting,

06:10.600 --> 06:13.040
 at first I recruited just attitude,

06:15.080 --> 06:16.800
 but I needed more than that.

06:16.800 --> 06:21.360
 I needed some genetics in that wrestling room

06:21.360 --> 06:25.480
 to actually, that hard work people,

06:25.480 --> 06:29.240
 they could look and see, wow,

06:29.240 --> 06:32.800
 that execution, that's unbelievable.

06:32.800 --> 06:37.360
 But yet I can beat that guy after the first minute.

06:37.360 --> 06:42.360
 So you think the art, the technique is genetics.

06:42.600 --> 06:43.760
 You're born with it.

06:43.760 --> 06:44.600
 You think it's not something.

06:44.600 --> 06:48.440
 I think your pop and your ability to move.

06:48.440 --> 06:49.280
 Timing.

06:49.280 --> 06:53.520
 And timing and your quickness and your strength.

06:53.520 --> 06:58.200
 The Russians, they usually picked out

06:59.200 --> 07:01.760
 the people that can go into that sport.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.120
 That was the old fashioned sports school.

07:04.120 --> 07:07.920
 But it's mostly like when you walk into a Russian

07:07.920 --> 07:12.200
 wrestling room, you see them hitting skills, techniques.

07:12.200 --> 07:15.480
 You don't see them banging against each other that much.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.120
 But then when practice is over,

07:17.120 --> 07:18.920
 you might not see a bunch of sprints.

07:18.920 --> 07:22.760
 You might see them walk over to the ropes

07:22.760 --> 07:25.160
 and they drop down from the ceiling

07:25.160 --> 07:28.160
 and they'll jump up and climb a rope, boom, boom, boom.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.680
 And then they come down and then they don't jump

07:30.680 --> 07:31.680
 right back on.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.320
 They have three or four other guys go

07:33.320 --> 07:34.760
 and then they jump back on.

07:34.760 --> 07:38.040
 Whereas I probably made my guys climb them,

07:38.040 --> 07:40.920
 get right back down, climb them right back again.

07:40.920 --> 07:45.920
 But I also realized that I had to have a mix of that.

07:46.720 --> 07:47.560
 What was the role?

07:47.560 --> 07:48.520
 What was your role?

07:48.520 --> 07:51.080
 I mean, those guys looked up and Dan Gable

07:51.080 --> 07:53.600
 and what was the role in helping these athletes

07:53.600 --> 07:54.760
 become their best?

07:54.760 --> 07:55.600
 These national champions.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.920
 Well, you had to first of all prove that you were,

07:58.920 --> 08:00.360
 knew what you were doing.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.400
 In terms of technique or in terms of hard work?

08:02.400 --> 08:03.560
 Everything, everything.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.640
 They just, you had to be the first guy there

08:05.640 --> 08:06.560
 and the last guy to leave

08:06.560 --> 08:08.400
 and you had to be the most dedicated guy,

08:08.400 --> 08:10.160
 even though they were the ones that's trying to

08:10.160 --> 08:11.960
 win the championships.

08:11.960 --> 08:14.440
 You had to prove that you were gonna work just as hard

08:14.440 --> 08:15.920
 as they were as a coach.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.240
 And what does that look like?

08:17.240 --> 08:20.120
 So you can see it when you, you know it when you see it?

08:20.120 --> 08:22.200
 Well, you're there ahead of them

08:22.200 --> 08:24.320
 and you're there after they leave.

08:25.360 --> 08:26.760
 It's that simple.

08:26.760 --> 08:29.880
 I'm picking up after them and you're analyzing them.

08:29.880 --> 08:34.360
 You outwork them, you outwork them and you outthink them.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.200
 And so, you know, use that type of strategy.

08:36.200 --> 08:39.800
 And over time, when you prove it works,

08:39.800 --> 08:43.720
 because some of my kids that were the best kids

08:43.720 --> 08:48.720
 in the world really shouldn't have been a wrestler.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.440
 I mean, they weren't very coordinated,

08:53.000 --> 08:56.880
 but they worked so hard to develop themselves.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.360
 What was your role in that process?

08:58.360 --> 09:01.560
 I mean, that means pushing kids to their limit.

09:01.560 --> 09:02.920
 If you're not...

09:02.920 --> 09:04.640
 Yeah, but you can't push kids to their limit.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.440
 And even when you push them to their limit,

09:06.440 --> 09:07.760
 that's not their limit

09:07.760 --> 09:09.600
 because their limit's above and beyond that.

09:09.600 --> 09:14.040
 I mean, yeah, coaches sometimes accidentally don't,

09:14.040 --> 09:16.760
 they lose kids because of the heat,

09:16.760 --> 09:19.040
 because of hard work and all that.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.640
 And you gotta know when to back off.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.520
 You gotta read your athletes.

09:24.520 --> 09:28.120
 And by that, I mean, you gotta know them pretty well.

09:28.120 --> 09:30.080
 Every once in a while, you make a little bit of a mistake,

09:30.080 --> 09:32.080
 but if you don't react right on that mistake

09:32.080 --> 09:35.520
 before it gets too far, then it's gonna be a casualty.

09:35.520 --> 09:38.000
 And I don't mean somebody dying necessarily,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.800
 but maybe something that could turn them off

09:40.800 --> 09:43.200
 or maybe something that could run them away

09:43.200 --> 09:46.800
 or maybe something that, wow, that was close.

09:46.800 --> 09:49.000
 Maybe shouldn't have pushed them that far.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.600
 So you really have to be very educated.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.600
 And it's not just what you know,

09:54.600 --> 09:56.320
 it's what you know about them.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.880
 And I'm not talking about the team.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.280
 I'm talking about each guy on the team.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.120
 Individuals, yeah.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.320
 Yeah, each person on the team.

10:01.320 --> 10:03.400
 And you know it how?

10:03.400 --> 10:04.240
 You see it in their eyes?

10:04.240 --> 10:06.880
 You know it how because you're the first one there

10:06.880 --> 10:08.160
 and you're the last one to leave

10:08.160 --> 10:10.700
 and you set in the environment with them.

10:10.700 --> 10:13.240
 You're there in the morning for practice sometimes.

10:13.240 --> 10:15.280
 You're there in the afternoon for two or three hours.

10:15.280 --> 10:18.440
 After practice, you might have a hot room

10:18.440 --> 10:21.680
 or you might have a sauna or a steam or a whirlpool

10:21.680 --> 10:25.160
 and you get in there with them and you listen.

10:25.160 --> 10:28.080
 You're not just feeding out information.

10:28.080 --> 10:31.120
 You do that, but you're taking in a lot of that too.

10:31.120 --> 10:33.720
 And I'm telling you, when you get in an atmosphere

10:33.720 --> 10:36.560
 that they're relaxed and they feel comfortable,

10:36.560 --> 10:38.600
 it's like a massage.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.560
 And that's after practice in one of those areas

10:41.560 --> 10:44.440
 that people are around you, you learn a lot.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.480
 I mean, you got a lot to learn as a coach.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.060
 And when you get in that atmosphere,

10:48.060 --> 10:51.200
 when all of a sudden you feel like very comfortable,

10:52.320 --> 10:54.240
 words start flowing.

10:54.240 --> 10:59.240
 And when those words flow, you take them in as a coach.

10:59.480 --> 11:02.280
 And there's something probably gonna be said

11:02.280 --> 11:04.080
 that you can do and act upon

11:04.080 --> 11:07.320
 that's gonna help certain situations.

11:07.320 --> 11:09.880
 I've saved a couple of kids lives for sure

11:09.880 --> 11:11.480
 that were on the brink.

11:11.480 --> 11:14.120
 Sometimes performance is at such a high level

11:14.120 --> 11:16.120
 in a high level atmosphere

11:17.960 --> 11:21.520
 that life and death is actually involved.

11:21.520 --> 11:24.480
 And I don't mean pushing a kid to where he just dies,

11:24.480 --> 11:28.040
 but I mean, he might feel himself as a failure.

11:28.040 --> 11:30.360
 He might go home and take his own life.

11:30.360 --> 11:31.840
 Yeah, I mean, but that's part of it.

11:31.840 --> 11:34.320
 You're putting so much heart,

11:34.320 --> 11:36.080
 so much blood and heart and sweat

11:36.080 --> 11:39.520
 and your whole meaning of life becomes winning.

11:39.520 --> 11:43.600
 So, and sometimes it's so hard to lose within that context.

11:43.600 --> 11:47.080
 So if in your, I think the first wrestling life

11:47.080 --> 11:51.320
 you wrote about Chad Zapato who lost,

11:51.320 --> 11:52.880
 I mean, incredible wrestler,

11:52.880 --> 11:55.440
 but lost in three finals in the nationals

11:55.440 --> 11:59.960
 and has this tattoo of a hawk clawing out the human heart.

11:59.960 --> 12:03.200
 Yeah, so what lessons, is there any lessons

12:03.200 --> 12:06.580
 from the incredible wrestling he's done,

12:06.580 --> 12:09.280
 but also the incredible suffering that he went through

12:10.320 --> 12:11.160
 on himself?

12:11.160 --> 12:14.880
 Yeah, again, you like that word suffering, which is okay.

12:14.880 --> 12:15.720
 Okay, so.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.200
 No, no, no, no, no, keep it, keep it.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.600
 Cause it fits right in where I want.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.760
 I have to turn that suffering around

12:22.720 --> 12:25.800
 to where he makes and feels good about himself

12:25.800 --> 12:29.120
 or better, doesn't have to feel perfect.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.360
 Cause he did lose, you know?

12:31.360 --> 12:35.580
 And so, but you have to actually get him to realize

12:35.580 --> 12:37.460
 that yeah, he's still unique

12:37.460 --> 12:38.960
 compared to the walk of the earth.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.880
 He was unbelievably unique right at the top,

12:41.880 --> 12:43.640
 just a little bit short of,

12:43.640 --> 12:48.080
 but because it was, you know, he felt the suffering,

12:48.080 --> 12:50.680
 you now have to go about and change that

12:50.680 --> 12:52.800
 and put it into goodwill some way.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.580
 And because he's, you really have a lot of goodwill,

12:55.580 --> 12:57.360
 you can do a lot of goodwill.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.640
 And so, and it's not easy.

13:00.640 --> 13:05.640
 It took him probably years, years of tattooing.

13:05.800 --> 13:06.640
 Yeah.

13:06.640 --> 13:08.400
 Years of covering the tattoos.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.040
 And, you know, he told me he moved to,

13:12.040 --> 13:13.440
 I go, why are you moving to California?

13:13.440 --> 13:15.200
 Cause he was here for a couple of years

13:15.200 --> 13:18.160
 after his wrestling was done, cause he had a good job

13:18.160 --> 13:21.280
 around here and he was, I thought he was doing a good job,

13:21.280 --> 13:24.960
 but he just, he said, I had to escape, you know?

13:24.960 --> 13:26.880
 Yeah, it's the same as the covering up the tattoo.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.160
 I had a wrestling terminology.

13:28.160 --> 13:32.120
 I have to get, I hate to say this, I hate to say this.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.800
 I go, where are you going?

13:33.800 --> 13:35.600
 He said, I'm gonna go to California.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
 And I go, is there any reason why you're going to California?

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
 And he says, that's where everybody goes to hide.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.160
 But I said, I think you're wrong there,

13:51.160 --> 13:55.060
 but you know, I think what will determine your life

13:55.060 --> 13:57.400
 will be what you do from now on, you know?

13:57.400 --> 14:00.200
 And if you can find, and he's actually turned it around.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.400
 I mean, he's actually turned it around.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.840
 You have to discover that yourself.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.240
 Exactly, and he went someplace

14:04.240 --> 14:08.980
 that he thought he could fit into, and I think he did.

14:08.980 --> 14:11.640
 And I think he's got a good job, and he's helping people,

14:11.640 --> 14:16.640
 and he covered that tattoo with feathers, another tattoo.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.520
 Well, in the end, it's a beautiful story.

14:20.520 --> 14:21.560
 Yeah, it is, it really is.

14:21.560 --> 14:22.960
 Suffering and overcoming.

14:22.960 --> 14:25.140
 Yeah, and he's not done yet.

14:25.140 --> 14:25.980
 He's not done yet.

14:25.980 --> 14:26.820
 No, he's not done.

14:26.820 --> 14:29.840
 He's got a lot more to do.

14:29.840 --> 14:32.560
 So you mentioned Roger Bannister,

14:32.560 --> 14:34.640
 again, I think in your first book,

14:34.640 --> 14:36.480
 and somebody you looked up to,

14:36.480 --> 14:39.080
 that's the man who broke the four minute mile, right?

14:40.080 --> 14:42.000
 When everybody said it was impossible,

14:42.000 --> 14:43.400
 everyone thought it was impossible.

14:43.400 --> 14:44.620
 Oh, they thought he would die.

14:44.620 --> 14:45.460
 He would die.

14:45.460 --> 14:47.940
 It's not humanly possible, yeah.

14:47.940 --> 14:49.080
 So what?

14:49.080 --> 14:50.800
 Well, you've done your homework.

14:50.800 --> 14:51.920
 For what, the book, or what?

14:51.920 --> 14:53.600
 Oh, I don't know, for me, you've done your homework.

14:53.600 --> 14:54.880
 Yeah, I know, but yeah.

14:54.880 --> 14:55.720
 What?

14:55.720 --> 14:59.480
 I was sitting here by Putin to do research, yeah.

14:59.480 --> 15:03.040
 So what lesson do you take from that story for yourself,

15:03.040 --> 15:05.880
 the impossible, trying to accomplish the impossible?

15:05.880 --> 15:07.680
 Well, the impossible is possible.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.320
 It's just that simple.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.040
 Time changes things.

15:12.040 --> 15:17.040
 I mean, if you looked at where the mile time is right now,

15:18.440 --> 15:20.560
 compared to that four minute mile,

15:20.560 --> 15:23.120
 which when it was broke by a couple of tenths,

15:23.120 --> 15:24.640
 or three or four tenths,

15:25.500 --> 15:30.520
 it's now broke by another 20 seconds.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.920
 Yeah, by several hundred people, yeah.

15:32.920 --> 15:35.200
 Yeah, I mean, by tons of people.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.480
 And it's pretty much common knowledge

15:37.480 --> 15:38.680
 that you gotta run a four minute mile

15:38.680 --> 15:39.920
 if you're gonna go somewhere now,

15:39.920 --> 15:43.960
 or below if you're gonna win events at major level,

15:43.960 --> 15:45.760
 that you gotta be able to do that.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.520
 And so you can take that,

15:47.520 --> 15:52.520
 and you can look at what in time history

15:53.360 --> 15:56.480
 has as its record performance,

15:58.040 --> 16:01.640
 and you can realize that that record performance,

16:01.640 --> 16:02.600
 it's gonna change.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.420
 Yeah.

16:03.420 --> 16:07.380
 And they don't take into all the factors of knowledge.

16:08.320 --> 16:12.480
 They don't take in all the factors of better shoes.

16:12.480 --> 16:13.840
 They don't take in all the factors

16:13.840 --> 16:16.920
 of better understanding of nutrition.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.020
 I mean, it's like me as an athlete.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.700
 I went to practice every day in high school

16:23.700 --> 16:27.720
 for at least my sophomore, and my junior,

16:27.720 --> 16:29.960
 and part of my senior year,

16:29.960 --> 16:33.760
 and all of a sudden a new rule came up.

16:33.760 --> 16:37.360
 It said, the rule said before that,

16:37.360 --> 16:41.540
 it said at least most of the coaches,

16:43.160 --> 16:45.560
 we don't want you drinking water at practice.

16:45.560 --> 16:46.400
 Yeah.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.960
 And okay, why?

16:48.960 --> 16:50.440
 Because you gotta toughen you up.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.440
 That's a weakness, water.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.280
 And so we would go through practice.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.600
 I mean, and you're sweating,

16:56.600 --> 16:57.800
 and then you're sweating so much

16:57.800 --> 16:59.600
 that you're almost out of sweat.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.440
 Yeah.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.800
 And so you're mostly at the end of practice,

17:02.800 --> 17:04.560
 you're not even wrestling.

17:04.560 --> 17:05.400
 Excuse me.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.800
 You're setting against the wall.

17:06.800 --> 17:07.640
 Yeah.

17:07.640 --> 17:08.460
 Because you're tired.

17:08.460 --> 17:10.600
 So then all of a sudden they say,

17:10.600 --> 17:12.920
 okay, go ahead and drink water during practice,

17:12.920 --> 17:14.360
 drink greater aid during practice.

17:14.360 --> 17:16.200
 And all of a sudden at the end of practice,

17:16.200 --> 17:18.160
 we're still out there competing.

17:18.160 --> 17:21.120
 And so I look at my career for two and a half years

17:21.120 --> 17:23.960
 where I, and junior high too.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.360
 So I got another three years

17:25.360 --> 17:28.800
 where I didn't really, wasn't able to push

17:28.800 --> 17:32.480
 as good as I could because I just was probably under.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.320
 Under hydrated.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.140
 Yeah.

17:34.140 --> 17:34.980
 Yeah.

17:34.980 --> 17:37.040
 So, but at the individual level,

17:37.040 --> 17:38.760
 in terms of the impossible,

17:38.760 --> 17:41.400
 when did you first believe the thing

17:41.400 --> 17:43.680
 that maybe probably people would laugh at you about

17:43.680 --> 17:46.600
 was that you would be an Olympic champion?

17:46.600 --> 17:50.880
 Well, I always visualized me being the best.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.040
 You believed it in the very beginning.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.720
 Forever, forever.

17:53.720 --> 17:55.800
 Yeah, I was, because I was,

17:55.800 --> 17:59.200
 I don't know if you'd call it a dreamer or somebody that,

17:59.200 --> 18:01.800
 I was just involved with competitive sports

18:01.800 --> 18:05.120
 at the YMCA from age five.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.600
 Did you tell people that dream

18:06.600 --> 18:08.960
 that you're gonna be Olympic champion one day?

18:08.960 --> 18:10.280
 You're gonna be the best in the world?

18:10.280 --> 18:12.200
 I think they knew.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.440
 And the only reason why they knew,

18:13.440 --> 18:15.080
 cause there was something a little different

18:15.080 --> 18:15.920
 about this guy.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.640
 He was.

18:17.640 --> 18:18.480
 He's not gonna stop.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.080
 Well, he was out in the yard.

18:20.080 --> 18:20.920
 Yeah.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.200
 And he was swinging baseball bats.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.040
 Yeah.

18:23.040 --> 18:24.440
 He was swinging baseball at six, at seven,

18:24.440 --> 18:26.400
 and eight, and nine, and 10.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.240
 And he was swinging baseball bats,

18:29.200 --> 18:31.480
 so much right handed and so much left hand

18:31.480 --> 18:33.480
 with nobody even there throwing the ball.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.840
 Yeah.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.760
 That all of a sudden when they walked by,

18:36.760 --> 18:39.760
 all of a sudden the grass was down to dirt

18:39.760 --> 18:40.600
 on both sides.

18:40.600 --> 18:41.440
 Yeah.

18:41.440 --> 18:45.640
 So it's like, they saw me out in the yard

18:45.640 --> 18:48.280
 playing by myself sports,

18:48.280 --> 18:51.800
 or you get the neighborhood kids and you play a lot.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.920
 But if they weren't there,

18:53.920 --> 18:55.560
 if you walked in my front room,

18:55.560 --> 18:58.120
 I was hiking a ball like I was the quarterback.

18:58.120 --> 19:02.320
 And I was running and running through the furniture,

19:02.320 --> 19:03.160
 that type stuff.

19:03.160 --> 19:08.160
 So who saw this guy mostly was probably the parents.

19:08.520 --> 19:09.360
 Yeah.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.640
 And the coaches at the YMCA level,

19:11.640 --> 19:12.640
 the junior high level,

19:12.640 --> 19:15.400
 they saw this guy come first and end up last.

19:15.400 --> 19:18.560
 But I wasn't that great.

19:18.560 --> 19:21.160
 I wasn't the fastest guy at that time.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.440
 And I wasn't the strongest guy.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.880
 Actually, before I went to the Olympics,

19:25.880 --> 19:28.120
 when they tested me, they tested everybody.

19:28.120 --> 19:31.000
 And I probably came back with one of the highest scores,

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
 but it was not like the highest person on this

19:36.960 --> 19:38.320
 and this and that.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.320
 I was all high across the board,

19:40.320 --> 19:43.120
 straight across the board high on every one of them.

19:43.120 --> 19:45.800
 But there was always people that were higher than me.

19:45.800 --> 19:46.640
 Genetics.

19:46.640 --> 19:47.960
 But then they would go down.

19:47.960 --> 19:48.800
 Yeah.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.480
 Then they would test on something else and go back up.

19:50.480 --> 19:53.080
 Mine stayed high all across the board.

19:53.080 --> 19:56.120
 And so I really didn't have too many flaws,

19:56.120 --> 19:58.640
 but I didn't have any things that also said

19:58.640 --> 20:02.520
 that you were gonna be unscored upon at the Olympic games.

20:02.520 --> 20:03.360
 Right.

20:03.360 --> 20:06.080
 So take me through that day, if you could.

20:06.080 --> 20:09.560
 1972, when you were going for the 68 kilogram

20:09.560 --> 20:11.360
 freestyle wrestling gold,

20:11.360 --> 20:15.720
 you scored 57 points, if I'm correct,

20:15.720 --> 20:18.000
 and had zero points scored on you.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.900
 57, zero.

20:19.900 --> 20:24.040
 So maybe take me through almost the details.

20:24.040 --> 20:24.960
 What was your routine?

20:24.960 --> 20:25.920
 What was your process?

20:25.920 --> 20:27.400
 What was going through your mind,

20:27.400 --> 20:29.000
 your thoughts of that day?

20:29.000 --> 20:32.560
 Yeah, first of all, it was quite a day

20:32.560 --> 20:36.860
 because we weighed in every day at that time.

20:36.860 --> 20:37.700
 In the morning?

20:37.700 --> 20:39.000
 Yeah, we weighed in two hours

20:39.000 --> 20:41.120
 before the start of the competition.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.440
 And so that didn't mean that you weighed in two hours

20:43.440 --> 20:44.280
 before you wrestled,

20:44.280 --> 20:45.440
 because you didn't know whether you're gonna wrestle

20:45.440 --> 20:47.120
 right away or later on.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.080
 In fact, in that day,

20:48.080 --> 20:52.000
 I don't think I wrestled until later on in the evening.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.080
 So had all day to recover,

20:54.080 --> 20:55.760
 but I didn't really need it anyway,

20:55.760 --> 20:58.920
 because I wasn't really pulling a whole lot of weight,

20:58.920 --> 21:01.680
 but it was just interesting.

21:01.680 --> 21:02.600
 But what was in your mind?

21:02.600 --> 21:03.640
 What were you thinking?

21:03.640 --> 21:04.460
 Were you nervous?

21:04.460 --> 21:05.300
 Were you?

21:05.300 --> 21:06.760
 I was confident.

21:06.760 --> 21:07.800
 I was confident.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.300
 You knew you were gonna win the gold.

21:09.300 --> 21:11.200
 Yeah, I knew I was gonna win.

21:11.200 --> 21:14.440
 But in reality, I didn't know it

21:14.440 --> 21:16.000
 from a cocky point of view.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.080
 I only knew it because for the last

21:20.920 --> 21:23.560
 one, two, three and a half years,

21:23.560 --> 21:25.060
 I had been going to practice,

21:26.960 --> 21:28.980
 and I'd win in every practice.

21:28.980 --> 21:29.820
 You felt good, you won.

21:29.820 --> 21:31.760
 And I hardly ever lose a takedown.

21:31.760 --> 21:34.560
 And if I lost, if somebody scored on me,

21:35.740 --> 21:37.860
 it was like when I went to bed,

21:37.860 --> 21:40.480
 I couldn't sleep until I figured it out.

21:41.660 --> 21:44.080
 Or if I didn't figure it out,

21:44.080 --> 21:48.480
 I would fall asleep and I would wake up

21:48.480 --> 21:50.120
 with the answer of what I needed,

21:50.120 --> 21:51.160
 why I got scored upon.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.420
 So maybe now that you've won the gold,

21:53.420 --> 21:55.040
 can you tell me in the practice room

21:55.040 --> 21:57.080
 when somebody took you down,

21:57.080 --> 22:00.200
 how do you take Dan Gable down in the practice room?

22:00.200 --> 22:01.040
 Timing, technique?

22:01.040 --> 22:03.920
 Very difficult, but somebody could,

22:04.880 --> 22:07.620
 because they were going for one move.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.960
 All I wanted was one move.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.640
 Whereas if you can arrest somebody,

22:12.640 --> 22:14.320
 arrest them the whole practice or half a practice

22:14.320 --> 22:16.440
 for at least 10, 15 minutes,

22:16.440 --> 22:18.760
 and they were maybe gonna score

22:21.280 --> 22:23.140
 if they could work it in their mind.

22:24.920 --> 22:27.440
 But they knew that was gonna be their victory.

22:27.440 --> 22:31.840
 So in the practice room, maybe you can educate me,

22:31.840 --> 22:34.240
 at that, when you're going for the Olympic gold,

22:35.560 --> 22:38.160
 you didn't want to allow any takedowns.

22:38.160 --> 22:39.540
 So there's no such thing as working

22:39.540 --> 22:41.120
 on some kind of weird position,

22:41.120 --> 22:42.640
 a weak point or something.

22:42.640 --> 22:45.680
 It's important to not let down, take down.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.920
 It's kind of like what we were saying before.

22:47.920 --> 22:50.720
 If something happened and somebody scored on me

22:50.720 --> 22:54.440
 in a certain way, I would go over that situation,

22:54.440 --> 22:56.880
 over that situation, over it again,

22:56.880 --> 22:58.640
 and I would come up with an answer.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.440
 And then I would actually test it.

23:01.560 --> 23:03.480
 Maybe I wouldn't go right back the next day

23:03.480 --> 23:07.120
 because I didn't want the guy to not have some,

23:07.120 --> 23:09.200
 I didn't want him to think that I was thinking

23:09.200 --> 23:11.080
 about it all night, I didn't tell him.

23:11.080 --> 23:14.100
 But maybe three days later when he wrestled again,

23:14.100 --> 23:19.100
 I actually had it figured out because he wasn't able to.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.440
 Or even if I was in on a takedown, an offensive move,

23:24.440 --> 23:27.120
 and I got stopped and didn't score,

23:27.120 --> 23:29.920
 I had to go back and filter that.

23:29.920 --> 23:34.160
 But it wasn't something that usually I couldn't solve.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.740
 I could usually solve it.

23:35.740 --> 23:37.040
 Let's go back to the Olympic games.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.320
 So I get up in the Olympic in the morning

23:39.320 --> 23:41.260
 and I'm not sure when the weigh ins were,

23:41.260 --> 23:44.280
 but I think I was probably a pound over.

23:45.760 --> 23:49.040
 And that's about a half a kilo and 1.1 pounds is a kilo

23:49.040 --> 23:50.240
 because we went in kilograms.

23:50.240 --> 23:51.480
 So what do you do with that pound?

23:51.480 --> 23:52.400
 You aren't off or?

23:52.400 --> 23:55.720
 No, I just went over to the, they had a sauna there

23:55.720 --> 23:56.960
 and I got in the sauna.

23:56.960 --> 24:00.720
 And the funny thing was the morning of the finals,

24:03.200 --> 24:06.680
 there was another athlete in the sauna.

24:06.680 --> 24:10.680
 And it was American or?

24:10.680 --> 24:12.880
 No, it was a European.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.880
 I don't remember where she was from.

24:14.880 --> 24:15.760
 Not a Russian.

24:15.760 --> 24:16.680
 Well, you know what?

24:16.680 --> 24:21.680
 I kind of think it was a plot because it was a girl.

24:22.040 --> 24:22.880
 Interesting.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.680
 And she didn't have her top on.

24:24.680 --> 24:25.520
 Oh, wow.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.640
 And that was pretty common.

24:28.640 --> 24:31.040
 And so, you know, it was kind of interesting.

24:31.040 --> 24:36.040
 You think back about it because there's some funny things

24:36.040 --> 24:40.800
 that go on behind the scenes in Olympic games,

24:40.800 --> 24:43.560
 in world games, anytime when you have country

24:43.560 --> 24:44.520
 against country.

24:44.520 --> 24:47.040
 And so there's some crazy stuff that goes on.

24:47.040 --> 24:49.120
 Did any of it affect you?

24:49.120 --> 24:49.960
 Was there any?

24:49.960 --> 24:51.840
 Well, I almost stayed too long in the sauna.

24:51.840 --> 24:56.240
 You lost a little bit over a pound.

24:56.240 --> 24:58.160
 I lost a little more than a pound.

24:58.160 --> 25:00.960
 But it didn't really bother me

25:00.960 --> 25:04.200
 because I wasn't like cutting a lot of weight.

25:04.200 --> 25:08.120
 So your match against the Russian, the...

25:08.120 --> 25:08.960
 Azhelyov.

25:08.960 --> 25:09.880
 Yeah, Azhelyov.

25:09.880 --> 25:12.040
 He went on to be a two time world champion,

25:12.040 --> 25:13.600
 a silver medalist as well.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.560
 I mean, this is an incredible wrestler.

25:15.560 --> 25:17.560
 So what was going through your mind

25:18.520 --> 25:20.600
 before stepping on the mat with that guy?

25:20.600 --> 25:22.240
 You've beaten a bunch of wrestlers,

25:22.240 --> 25:24.600
 haven't had a point scored on you.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.840
 And you're stepping on the mat against this Russian

25:26.840 --> 25:29.080
 who you said was really, they picked,

25:29.080 --> 25:31.360
 the Soviets picked to beat you.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.200
 Right, and I know why they picked him

25:33.200 --> 25:34.760
 because he had a great attitude.

25:34.760 --> 25:38.560
 So he wasn't just the typical artist.

25:38.560 --> 25:39.760
 He was a good artist.

25:39.760 --> 25:42.400
 He hooked elbows like Azhelyov.

25:42.400 --> 25:45.000
 And he's from that area of the world

25:45.000 --> 25:47.280
 where they have some of those types of moves.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.040
 But he, and he was a goer,

25:50.040 --> 25:52.320
 but by cutting him down a weight,

25:52.320 --> 25:53.640
 he lost some of that go.

25:54.800 --> 25:57.080
 And I don't know if, you gotta,

25:57.080 --> 26:00.600
 that's a process you gotta go about scientifically.

26:00.600 --> 26:01.440
 Yeah.

26:01.440 --> 26:04.800
 And so, if you don't do it as an American,

26:04.800 --> 26:06.360
 it can really hurt your performance.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.040
 If you don't do it as a Russian,

26:08.040 --> 26:09.120
 it can hurt your performance.

26:09.120 --> 26:12.720
 And they already didn't really do that a lot

26:12.720 --> 26:14.960
 where you usually wrestle the weight

26:14.960 --> 26:17.080
 where it was more like your weight.

26:17.080 --> 26:19.640
 And so by cutting him down,

26:19.640 --> 26:23.040
 maybe slowed his belief down a little bit.

26:23.040 --> 26:23.880
 So you saw it in him.

26:23.880 --> 26:26.240
 The spirit was a little bit gone when you were facing him.

26:26.240 --> 26:29.600
 Yeah, but then he came back and he won rest of the matches

26:29.600 --> 26:31.360
 and he was in the round robin

26:31.360 --> 26:33.440
 and he was able to go to the finals,

26:34.520 --> 26:36.840
 but he had lost another match actually

26:36.840 --> 26:39.160
 against in the round robin against the Japanese.

26:39.160 --> 26:44.160
 So I think I had already gained enough of artistic,

26:45.320 --> 26:46.720
 being able to finish a match.

26:46.720 --> 26:49.960
 Once I lost my match in college for the last two years,

26:49.960 --> 26:52.600
 I took on some of that artistic work.

26:52.600 --> 26:57.600
 And I think that he was already hoping to win,

26:57.680 --> 27:00.040
 but he was hoping to win by a long ways

27:00.040 --> 27:04.520
 because he had to pin me or beat me by eight points

27:04.520 --> 27:06.220
 to be able to win the gold.

27:06.220 --> 27:09.000
 And that wasn't gonna happen.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
 I mean, the chances of pin is pretty good.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.140
 Is it hard to pin Dan Gable versus take down?

27:14.140 --> 27:17.840
 Like, have you taken risks where you could pay for them?

27:17.840 --> 27:21.140
 I can't remember too many that I took

27:21.140 --> 27:23.960
 that would actually put me in a danger position.

27:23.960 --> 27:27.360
 I've taken risk, but the risks were so scientifically,

27:27.360 --> 27:30.700
 technically correct that I wouldn't land

27:30.700 --> 27:33.080
 in that danger zone.

27:33.080 --> 27:35.040
 It's like, if I'm gonna lock up and throw you,

27:35.040 --> 27:37.040
 I'm not gonna throw you to my own back

27:37.040 --> 27:38.040
 and roll you through.

27:38.040 --> 27:40.280
 I'm gonna turn in the air.

27:40.280 --> 27:41.360
 So you were scientific about it.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.600
 Yeah, exactly.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.200
 I learned the hard way.

27:46.200 --> 27:49.640
 Early on, there was moves from collegiate wrestling

27:49.640 --> 27:51.960
 that you did that exposed your shoulders,

27:51.960 --> 27:55.460
 which it cost me in some early freestyle matches

27:55.460 --> 27:57.580
 against great wrestlers.

27:57.580 --> 28:02.580
 But I would go back to my collegiate escaping type moves

28:03.420 --> 28:04.840
 to where I hit a Granby roll

28:04.840 --> 28:06.280
 where you expose your shoulders

28:06.280 --> 28:08.040
 and you lose two points every time.

28:08.040 --> 28:10.400
 But you learn that that's not the system.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.800
 But if you hadn't wrestled much,

28:12.800 --> 28:17.800
 you would get exposed under maybe a desperate situation.

28:17.900 --> 28:18.880
 You would hit it.

28:18.880 --> 28:20.640
 So you won the gold.

28:20.640 --> 28:22.380
 How did it feel?

28:22.380 --> 28:23.800
 I think it would have,

28:23.800 --> 28:26.200
 I think the question would be how would it feel

28:26.200 --> 28:28.680
 if you lost the gold for me?

28:28.680 --> 28:31.240
 Because I already went through that once.

28:32.420 --> 28:33.520
 Not at that highest level,

28:33.520 --> 28:35.840
 but the National Collegiate Championship level

28:35.840 --> 28:36.680
 my senior year.

28:36.680 --> 28:37.680
 The Larry Owings loss.

28:37.680 --> 28:39.000
 Larry Owings, yeah.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.480
 And that didn't sit well.

28:40.480 --> 28:43.320
 Were you afraid of that happening again

28:44.200 --> 28:45.400
 at the Olympic level?

28:45.400 --> 28:46.240
 Was that even a thought?

28:46.240 --> 28:47.420
 No, I really wasn't.

28:47.420 --> 28:52.200
 But it was why I changed my philosophy of training

28:52.200 --> 28:57.200
 and added to the scientific artist type.

28:57.840 --> 29:00.060
 And if I had won that match,

29:00.060 --> 29:01.600
 even though I wouldn't have felt good about it,

29:01.600 --> 29:03.700
 even though I squeaked it out,

29:04.600 --> 29:06.880
 I wasn't feeling good about that match.

29:06.880 --> 29:09.640
 It would have affected me a little bit,

29:09.640 --> 29:10.480
 but if I'd have won it,

29:10.480 --> 29:12.360
 I would have got over it.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.600
 I mean, I'm not over it now.

29:14.600 --> 29:17.720
 I mean, I don't know why I was doing this kind of stuff

29:17.720 --> 29:19.840
 right before my match.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.000
 By that, I mean this kind of stuff.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.200
 Interviews, yeah, journalists.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.080
 Yeah, and I really wasn't a good talker then.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.880
 I mean, me and you were talking pretty good right now,

29:26.880 --> 29:28.040
 except for I got a little cold,

29:28.040 --> 29:32.740
 but I don't think I could say two words hardly then.

29:32.740 --> 29:35.580
 And they took takes.

29:35.580 --> 29:36.520
 Wide World of Sports said,

29:36.520 --> 29:39.520
 hey, we want you to be the introduction

29:39.520 --> 29:41.400
 for our next week's show.

29:41.400 --> 29:42.940
 So I just say, hey, I'm Dan Gable.

29:42.940 --> 29:46.340
 Come watch me as I finish my career undefeated 182 and 0.

29:46.340 --> 29:47.240
 That's what they want me to say.

29:47.240 --> 29:48.960
 Everybody assumed you'd be undefeated.

29:48.960 --> 29:50.700
 And I said it.

29:50.700 --> 29:52.680
 I had to take it 22 times.

29:52.680 --> 29:56.080
 And the last two or three times they wrote it out

29:56.080 --> 29:59.280
 and I read it and it still wasn't like I just said it.

29:59.280 --> 30:02.880
 I was reading it like, hi, I'm Dan Gable.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.120
 Come on.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.400
 You know, that type of stuff.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.640
 So, and he finally just closed the book and said,

30:08.640 --> 30:10.120
 yeah, that's good enough.

30:10.120 --> 30:12.360
 But I turned and it was my time to wrestle.

30:13.440 --> 30:17.120
 And so, you know, you just, you learn that,

30:17.120 --> 30:20.400
 and for me it was great coaching experience

30:20.400 --> 30:22.040
 because that's what I turned into be.

30:22.040 --> 30:25.400
 You know, I coached for longer than I wrestled.

30:25.400 --> 30:28.200
 And I put out a lot of champions,

30:28.200 --> 30:32.060
 but you learn through mistakes that even in your own career

30:32.060 --> 30:36.080
 that you had made, you know, it's an ever learning process.

30:36.080 --> 30:37.680
 It's an ever learning process.

30:38.560 --> 30:40.880
 Have you ever been afraid on the mat?

30:40.880 --> 30:45.700
 Does fear have any role do you think for a wrestler

30:45.700 --> 30:46.540
 or it must be out there?

30:46.540 --> 30:48.880
 Well, I'm sure fear is out there.

30:48.880 --> 30:52.360
 And I'm sure that was to my advantage almost every time.

30:52.360 --> 30:54.920
 I'm sure in my Olympic finals, I was really off.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.200
 He had these doubts.

30:56.200 --> 30:57.840
 He probably had these doubts.

30:58.760 --> 31:01.940
 And that gives me the edge.

31:02.840 --> 31:07.240
 And I don't know if I really ever had fear,

31:09.280 --> 31:12.160
 but obviously there was points in times

31:12.160 --> 31:16.680
 where I didn't perform as well, not many, but a few.

31:16.680 --> 31:20.120
 And if I look back of it, look back at it,

31:20.120 --> 31:24.440
 I don't think it was that American, you know,

31:24.440 --> 31:26.160
 raw, raw, raw stuff.

31:26.160 --> 31:28.880
 I think it was probably the fear

31:28.880 --> 31:33.040
 of not being an artist as much.

31:33.040 --> 31:34.760
 You know, maybe this guy might be better

31:34.760 --> 31:37.920
 than me scientifically.

31:37.920 --> 31:40.360
 And you know, you're a scientist.

31:40.360 --> 31:43.600
 I think that got to me more than anything else.

31:43.600 --> 31:46.760
 I said early on that I want to eliminate

31:46.760 --> 31:49.800
 ever having to worry about getting tired in a match.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.600
 So I kind of eliminated that.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.400
 So I got rid of that point.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.980
 And I do think that in wrestling,

31:55.980 --> 32:00.320
 that is one of the fears that a lot of wrestlers have,

32:00.320 --> 32:02.560
 actually how they feel during the match

32:02.560 --> 32:05.960
 and are they gonna get tired

32:05.960 --> 32:08.380
 and is it gonna affect my performance?

32:08.380 --> 32:11.320
 And as a coach, that really was one of the things

32:11.320 --> 32:13.520
 I tried to eliminate on all my athletes.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.360
 So there wasn't that fear factor,

32:15.360 --> 32:19.840
 but that fear factor would be put upon my opponent,

32:19.840 --> 32:22.380
 which would give me an edge.

32:23.240 --> 32:25.720
 But that's not what I needed as much.

32:25.720 --> 32:26.760
 I needed to just focus,

32:26.760 --> 32:28.720
 make sure that I was doing the right things.

32:28.720 --> 32:30.080
 And I needed my team to be focused.

32:30.080 --> 32:33.320
 So I made sure that for my mistakes as an athlete

32:33.320 --> 32:36.400
 or even as a coach sometimes, that I didn't repeat them.

32:37.440 --> 32:38.280
 Didn't repeat them.

32:38.280 --> 32:41.120
 And if you make a mistake once and then you can repeat it,

32:41.120 --> 32:44.640
 then it's like you didn't learn anything.

32:45.640 --> 32:47.800
 Your goal throughout your wrestling career,

32:47.800 --> 32:49.440
 as you've beautifully put,

32:49.440 --> 32:52.400
 was to work so hard that you pass out on the mat, right?

32:52.400 --> 32:54.160
 That you would be carried off the mat.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.500
 So you never did successfully in,

32:56.500 --> 32:58.440
 that's one of the ways you failed in your career

32:58.440 --> 33:01.420
 is you've never worked so hard that you've passed out.

33:01.420 --> 33:02.640
 Have you ever come close?

33:02.640 --> 33:04.640
 Do you remember a time that you've come close

33:04.640 --> 33:07.040
 that you've been pushed to the limits of exhaustion?

33:07.040 --> 33:08.980
 You know, the question is really a good question

33:08.980 --> 33:12.480
 about that pushing to you collapse.

33:12.480 --> 33:13.320
 Yeah.

33:13.320 --> 33:15.960
 Because I don't, as a coach today, I don't think I get,

33:15.960 --> 33:17.700
 if I said that to my athletes,

33:18.780 --> 33:20.640
 I don't know, I could get in trouble.

33:22.280 --> 33:23.120
 Because, you know, it's like.

33:23.120 --> 33:26.720
 But it's understood, isn't it, by the athletes?

33:26.720 --> 33:29.000
 Yeah, they understand it.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.480
 But the outside might not understand it.

33:31.480 --> 33:34.000
 Because it's almost like, what do you mean there?

33:34.000 --> 33:36.840
 You push them to the point where they go collapse.

33:36.840 --> 33:40.080
 It means they may die or something might happen to them.

33:40.080 --> 33:41.920
 And, you know, that's dangerous.

33:41.920 --> 33:42.740
 That's dangerous.

33:42.740 --> 33:45.160
 We can't have our kid in that type of atmosphere.

33:45.160 --> 33:48.480
 But it's something that's highly unlikely

33:48.480 --> 33:49.320
 that's gonna happen.

33:49.320 --> 33:52.160
 But I'm gonna tell you, there's many times in a practice

33:52.160 --> 33:55.480
 where I had pushed myself to all of a sudden

33:55.480 --> 33:58.280
 the whistle blew or it was time to stop.

33:58.280 --> 34:01.880
 And when I got up off the mat or wherever I was at

34:01.880 --> 34:06.880
 and I needed water, I needed fresh air,

34:07.840 --> 34:09.440
 because you're usually in a fairly small room

34:09.440 --> 34:12.440
 with a lot of guys that the heat rises

34:12.440 --> 34:14.980
 and it's hard to breathe.

34:14.980 --> 34:17.900
 And that I can remember, and I stayed a lot of times

34:17.900 --> 34:20.400
 not by the door, the far end of the room.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.680
 I can remember walking from the far end of the room

34:22.680 --> 34:23.600
 to that door.

34:23.600 --> 34:27.120
 And I can remember, am I gonna make it the next step?

34:27.120 --> 34:28.920
 Am I gonna make it the next step?

34:28.920 --> 34:31.620
 I need air, I need water, I need oxygen,

34:31.620 --> 34:33.080
 I need to get out of here.

34:33.080 --> 34:34.480
 It didn't happen often,

34:34.480 --> 34:37.600
 but I can recount four or five times in my career

34:37.600 --> 34:39.360
 that I pushed myself to that level

34:39.360 --> 34:42.240
 where I thought I was gonna maybe go out,

34:42.240 --> 34:44.760
 but every step I was dizzy.

34:44.760 --> 34:47.080
 But once I got to that door,

34:47.080 --> 34:50.160
 I was able to open it and go out and grab the water

34:50.160 --> 34:51.960
 and get cold water in my face.

34:51.960 --> 34:55.200
 And so, no, I never really was able to do that.

34:55.200 --> 34:57.300
 And I think the story is in a book

34:57.300 --> 35:00.760
 where my daughter pushed a collapse, Molly.

35:00.760 --> 35:01.600
 It made you proud.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.520
 Oh my gosh, and she didn't win.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.520
 But she pushed a collapse.

35:06.520 --> 35:09.840
 Now, did she suffer because of that?

35:10.760 --> 35:13.360
 Well, she didn't get to go to the next event

35:13.360 --> 35:15.200
 because she had to qualify.

35:15.200 --> 35:18.840
 But I think it probably helped her too,

35:18.840 --> 35:20.760
 realizing because she was winning the race

35:20.760 --> 35:23.200
 and she was beating people she normally never pushed,

35:23.200 --> 35:25.760
 but she was at a new level that she had never been before

35:25.760 --> 35:28.720
 and she only needed about five feet to finish.

35:28.720 --> 35:30.920
 And it was just one of those things that

35:30.920 --> 35:33.320
 I bet there was a lot of learning that she did there.

35:33.320 --> 35:37.440
 And it probably made her realize that she could be better,

35:37.440 --> 35:39.000
 but she had to hold up though.

35:40.360 --> 35:42.600
 So you mentioned in Wrestling Life

35:42.600 --> 35:47.360
 that the Brands Brothers looked up to Roy Salger,

35:47.360 --> 35:50.600
 who was known for pushing the limits of physical wrestling,

35:50.600 --> 35:52.700
 but not getting too rough.

35:52.700 --> 35:54.200
 So how do you find the line

35:54.200 --> 35:56.620
 between extreme physical wrestling,

35:56.620 --> 36:00.920
 but at the same time not rough wrestling or angry wrestling?

36:00.920 --> 36:05.320
 So that line between aggression, tough wrestling and anger.

36:05.320 --> 36:10.320
 Well, I think anger would cause less successful wrestling.

36:11.760 --> 36:14.960
 I think anger would cause you to make mistakes

36:14.960 --> 36:17.200
 and actually get out of position

36:18.160 --> 36:21.620
 because I think anger is kind of a loss of control.

36:21.620 --> 36:26.620
 And there can be a furious type of attack,

36:31.320 --> 36:34.320
 but I think if it crosses the line to anger,

36:36.320 --> 36:38.820
 then you're gonna be vulnerable.

36:38.820 --> 36:43.820
 And so Royce and the Brands wrestled to the edge,

36:47.320 --> 36:50.620
 through the edge, but when the whistle blew,

36:50.620 --> 36:52.520
 they stopped.

36:52.520 --> 36:54.620
 And there's people that when the whistle blows,

36:54.620 --> 36:55.460
 they keep going.

36:56.660 --> 36:59.360
 It's like in a football game,

36:59.360 --> 37:01.800
 a fight breaks out and it's after the whistles blow.

37:02.800 --> 37:06.120
 Well, when the whistle blew, they backed off.

37:07.480 --> 37:12.340
 So that whistle was something that in a match,

37:14.200 --> 37:18.080
 that kind of gave them the boundaries.

37:18.080 --> 37:20.360
 But perhaps it could be a little bit of fuel.

37:20.360 --> 37:23.000
 So in Wrestling Tough, the book that you just got

37:23.000 --> 37:25.240
 from Mike Chapman, the new edition,

37:25.240 --> 37:28.720
 talks about Bill Cole, undefeated Northern Iowa wrestler.

37:28.720 --> 37:33.600
 And how he talked about how my strength, speed

37:33.600 --> 37:36.140
 and ability to think were increased tremendously

37:36.140 --> 37:39.400
 by just sitting apart from the action prior to the match

37:39.400 --> 37:42.880
 and getting into a state of controlled anger.

37:42.880 --> 37:47.880
 So can anger, controlled, so anger could be fuel

37:48.280 --> 37:49.720
 as long as it's controlled.

37:49.720 --> 37:50.960
 Right, exactly.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.680
 You had that line.

37:52.680 --> 37:55.920
 One side of the line, you can have an anger

37:55.920 --> 37:58.480
 for performance and the other side of the line,

38:00.160 --> 38:02.720
 if you go beyond that, it's not gonna be for performance.

38:02.720 --> 38:04.960
 It's gonna be for not performance

38:04.960 --> 38:06.520
 because you're gonna lose points.

38:06.520 --> 38:07.500
 It's a fine line.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.560
 There's definitely a fine line.

38:09.560 --> 38:11.400
 You're talking about Roy Selger.

38:11.400 --> 38:13.000
 You're talking about Tom Brands.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.800
 You're talking about Terry Brands.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.620
 I mean, you got world championship titles there.

38:16.620 --> 38:18.340
 You got Olympic championship title there.

38:18.340 --> 38:23.340
 You got a world silver medalist in Roy Selger.

38:23.640 --> 38:28.640
 And when I talked to him about the world silver medalist,

38:30.080 --> 38:32.040
 he's haunted by that.

38:32.040 --> 38:35.200
 Cause he was actually 20 seconds away from winning

38:35.200 --> 38:36.880
 when he got beat in the end there,

38:36.880 --> 38:38.520
 but that's part of the game.

38:38.520 --> 38:43.520
 And I don't know whether he's okay with it or not.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.840
 Cause he says every, after talking about things,

38:45.840 --> 38:48.500
 he goes, I'm okay with it now.

38:49.400 --> 38:51.400
 But then he keeps talking about it.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.920
 So I don't really think he's okay with it.

38:54.980 --> 38:59.800
 And it's hard for him to actually make amends to himself

39:01.060 --> 39:02.560
 when you really don't do it.

39:02.560 --> 39:04.800
 I mean, it's no matter what the situation,

39:04.800 --> 39:07.360
 even with the Owings loss.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.040
 Yeah, it still eats it.

39:09.040 --> 39:10.860
 I mean, yeah, I'm a world champion.

39:10.860 --> 39:13.240
 He's not, and he wanted to be.

39:13.240 --> 39:14.560
 I'm Olympic champion.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.080
 He's not, he wanted to be.

39:16.080 --> 39:18.160
 One of the greatest coaches of all time.

39:18.160 --> 39:19.320
 Yeah, yeah.

39:19.320 --> 39:24.320
 And so, it's like, why do I keep going back to it?

39:25.720 --> 39:30.260
 Because you don't get over those things.

39:30.260 --> 39:32.360
 So Roy really keeps going back to it,

39:32.360 --> 39:33.800
 even though he says he's fine.

39:35.480 --> 39:38.080
 But then he realizes he's really not fine

39:38.080 --> 39:39.580
 because that's just the nature of the game.

39:39.580 --> 39:42.200
 And that's why he was able to win national titles

39:42.200 --> 39:46.360
 and make world teams and stuff like that.

39:48.100 --> 39:49.200
 What's interesting about him,

39:49.200 --> 39:52.040
 he's analyzed all the people that he's wrestled,

39:52.040 --> 39:55.680
 and a lot of them have won world and Olympic championships.

39:55.680 --> 39:58.560
 And he's beaten every one of them at one time or another.

39:58.560 --> 40:01.560
 And he didn't get to that world championship gold

40:01.560 --> 40:03.340
 or Olympic gold.

40:03.340 --> 40:08.040
 And he says it because they did it.

40:08.040 --> 40:12.960
 So he's showing people that I beaten those guys.

40:14.320 --> 40:18.080
 But apparently he didn't beat them at the right time.

40:18.080 --> 40:20.640
 And so it's still haunting.

40:20.640 --> 40:22.560
 You don't get away from that stuff.

40:22.560 --> 40:27.340
 I mean, it's just like anything in life that's really high.

40:27.340 --> 40:30.240
 I mean, it doesn't have to be athletics.

40:30.240 --> 40:32.480
 I mean, you think I'm ever gonna get over

40:33.520 --> 40:35.760
 the murder of my sister?

40:35.760 --> 40:37.120
 And you might not even know that.

40:37.120 --> 40:39.040
 Let me pause for a second, please.

40:39.040 --> 40:41.460
 You've talked about it, you've written about it.

40:41.460 --> 40:44.100
 So I hope it's okay for me to say that your sister,

40:44.100 --> 40:48.980
 your older sister, on May 31st, 1964,

40:48.980 --> 40:52.060
 was raped and murdered by a local boy.

40:52.960 --> 40:57.500
 So the echoes of pain and anger from that tragic day,

40:57.500 --> 40:59.780
 do they ripple through your life still?

41:00.640 --> 41:02.480
 Through your wrestling, through your coaching,

41:02.480 --> 41:06.360
 through the way you, when you wake up in the morning?

41:06.360 --> 41:07.320
 What is that like?

41:09.960 --> 41:14.580
 It can be very emotional to me under certain circumstances.

41:15.440 --> 41:20.440
 And it can be the mood I'm in.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.640
 It can be maybe if I've had a Mountain Dew

41:24.640 --> 41:27.360
 or maybe if I've had a Gable beer.

41:27.360 --> 41:32.360
 Yeah, or maybe if you turn the country music

41:33.640 --> 41:38.640
 up a little bit loud, emotions come out

41:39.400 --> 41:43.320
 and everybody has them in their life.

41:43.320 --> 41:46.720
 It's just so happens, what brings it out?

41:46.720 --> 41:49.360
 And hopefully it's nothing that you do

41:49.360 --> 41:52.480
 to the extreme point to where it brings it out.

41:52.480 --> 41:54.120
 For me, it's not extreme.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.680
 I don't have to have any of that really,

41:55.680 --> 41:57.760
 I can get emotional.

41:57.760 --> 41:59.500
 How did that change you as a man?

42:01.960 --> 42:03.840
 What it did was realize

42:03.840 --> 42:08.840
 that I was already pretty well developed

42:09.080 --> 42:11.120
 because I was only a sophomore,

42:11.120 --> 42:13.840
 15 years old in high school.

42:13.840 --> 42:17.860
 And I had parents that weren't making it.

42:17.860 --> 42:20.600
 And my parents are a lot older than me.

42:20.600 --> 42:24.040
 And now that we're down just to me and my parents,

42:24.040 --> 42:26.940
 and I'm gonna be around the house for another two years.

42:27.960 --> 42:30.400
 And they had just lost a daughter

42:30.400 --> 42:33.140
 that was the only other sibling.

42:36.660 --> 42:37.920
 They weren't handling it.

42:37.920 --> 42:42.960
 They were the ones that were suffering much more than me,

42:42.960 --> 42:47.860
 even though I always look back upon one area

42:47.860 --> 42:50.720
 that I wasn't good at was communication at that time,

42:50.720 --> 42:52.800
 except inside the resident room,

42:52.800 --> 42:54.280
 because I had been tipped off.

42:55.760 --> 42:57.480
 Tipped off, what do you mean?

42:57.480 --> 42:59.600
 Well, then everybody said that something to me

42:59.600 --> 43:03.000
 about my sister just three weeks before that,

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
 that really wasn't normal or practical.

43:08.080 --> 43:09.860
 And I said nothing to nobody.

43:12.920 --> 43:15.160
 Is there a part of you that blames yourself?

43:16.120 --> 43:18.280
 Yeah, absolutely.

43:19.520 --> 43:20.360
 Absolutely.

43:20.360 --> 43:25.360
 But I'm 15 years old and you make mistakes.

43:27.360 --> 43:30.000
 And you don't really act on everything

43:30.000 --> 43:31.440
 that happens in your life.

43:32.400 --> 43:34.000
 But I can tell you how it affected me.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.220
 And I acted a lot on anything

43:37.220 --> 43:39.580
 that maybe wasn't even of that consequence.

43:39.580 --> 43:41.120
 I mean, cause I had four daughters

43:41.120 --> 43:42.820
 and I'm telling you when they left every time

43:42.820 --> 43:45.600
 to go somewhere in a car or go out with someplace,

43:45.600 --> 43:47.840
 I always said something to them.

43:47.840 --> 43:50.900
 And they would always say, dad, you said that last night.

43:50.900 --> 43:51.740
 I don't care.

43:51.740 --> 43:54.160
 What, like I love you or like be careful?

43:54.160 --> 43:56.440
 I'd say like, don't be driving and drinking

43:56.440 --> 43:59.640
 or don't be in a car with somebody

43:59.640 --> 44:03.120
 that's of the same nature,

44:03.120 --> 44:05.360
 or stay out of trouble.

44:05.360 --> 44:07.720
 Don't go be somewhere where you have,

44:07.720 --> 44:09.200
 I said, you know how to get out of a car

44:09.200 --> 44:11.340
 if your car goes into the river.

44:12.800 --> 44:16.020
 I'm always thinking ahead a little bit,

44:16.020 --> 44:19.360
 just in case of something did happen.

44:19.360 --> 44:22.120
 And it goes back to that walk to school

44:22.120 --> 44:25.160
 with that young man that when he was talking to me

44:25.160 --> 44:28.480
 and I just, I took it and I kept it inside me.

44:28.480 --> 44:31.480
 And once I found out she had been murdered,

44:33.180 --> 44:37.040
 it took me maybe 25 to 30 minutes.

44:37.040 --> 44:39.920
 And I told my dad, I think I know who killed her.

44:41.140 --> 44:44.640
 And he looked at me and he just like,

44:44.640 --> 44:46.080
 he slapped me actually.

44:46.080 --> 44:47.280
 He pushed me against the car.

44:47.280 --> 44:48.120
 He didn't slap me.

44:48.120 --> 44:48.960
 He pushed me against the car.

44:48.960 --> 44:49.800
 My mom slaps me.

44:49.800 --> 44:51.320
 She was the one that slapped me around a little bit.

44:51.320 --> 44:55.120
 But my dad, he pushed me against the car and go,

44:55.120 --> 44:57.360
 what do you mean you might know something about this?

44:57.360 --> 44:59.760
 I said, dad, I don't for sure,

44:59.760 --> 45:02.360
 but, and I would probably all crying,

45:02.360 --> 45:05.400
 but, and I don't, I doubt if I was crying yet.

45:06.400 --> 45:08.540
 I've probably cried a lot of tears since,

45:08.540 --> 45:11.280
 but, you know, I just said,

45:11.280 --> 45:15.040
 hey, I was walking to school with this neighbor

45:15.040 --> 45:17.880
 and I never had walked to school with him before.

45:17.880 --> 45:20.840
 And he was kind of a troubled kid.

45:20.840 --> 45:25.840
 And he said something about Diane and it wasn't good,

45:26.080 --> 45:29.680
 but I didn't, he goes, why didn't you say something?

45:29.680 --> 45:33.040
 I said, daddy, I just boy talk, you know?

45:33.040 --> 45:35.600
 So, you know, and so he hugged me, he hugged me,

45:35.600 --> 45:39.520
 he hugged me and, you know, it was one of these things

45:39.520 --> 45:44.520
 that it's definitely made me a lot of who I am

45:46.120 --> 45:48.680
 because there's been a lot of choices and I don't,

45:48.680 --> 45:51.040
 I took the word choice out of my life

45:51.040 --> 45:53.360
 and I just like to say, okay, do the right thing,

45:53.360 --> 45:55.520
 do the thing that you should do.

45:55.520 --> 45:57.200
 And so I don't really, it's like,

45:57.200 --> 45:58.480
 are you gonna do this or this?

45:58.480 --> 45:59.320
 Well, what do you mean?

45:59.320 --> 46:00.820
 Which one's better?

46:00.820 --> 46:01.660
 You know?

46:01.660 --> 46:03.640
 Well, then I'm, so I don't have that choice.

46:03.640 --> 46:05.240
 Just give me the right way to go.

46:05.240 --> 46:08.240
 And so not that I've been perfect by any means,

46:08.240 --> 46:10.880
 but it's made a big difference in my life

46:10.880 --> 46:13.820
 on how I handle my life.

46:13.820 --> 46:16.400
 It's probably given me the opportunity

46:16.400 --> 46:18.120
 to be married for 44 years.

46:18.120 --> 46:22.460
 It's just given me opportunities to be better in my life.

46:22.460 --> 46:26.640
 And I, you know, I wanna thank my sister for that,

46:26.640 --> 46:31.640
 you know, and I think my family was ready to make a split

46:33.520 --> 46:36.200
 because of that incident, they're blaming each other.

46:36.200 --> 46:41.200
 And I think that I was able to help, but more than that,

46:41.840 --> 46:43.060
 they really liked each other,

46:43.060 --> 46:45.560
 but they didn't really know it at the time

46:45.560 --> 46:47.520
 until I got out of the house.

46:47.520 --> 46:50.320
 Two years later, it probably was going on

46:50.320 --> 46:52.960
 for a couple of years until I moved on and went to college.

46:52.960 --> 46:55.320
 Then they found out they really liked each other

46:55.320 --> 46:58.520
 when they were alone and it worked out pretty good.

46:58.520 --> 47:02.080
 But I think them being able to follow me,

47:02.080 --> 47:06.880
 not just through college and the Olympics and worlds,

47:06.880 --> 47:08.200
 but my coaching.

47:08.200 --> 47:11.700
 So it's the same, the same success and factor,

47:11.700 --> 47:14.320
 you know, the excitement and all those things

47:14.320 --> 47:16.980
 gave them a real purpose.

47:16.980 --> 47:21.280
 And it gave my four daughters, it gave my wife,

47:21.280 --> 47:24.240
 you know, a real purpose to be able to be close

47:24.240 --> 47:27.080
 to all these champions and championships.

47:27.080 --> 47:32.080
 And now it's like, there's a family of 22

47:32.080 --> 47:34.600
 and they're all interested in what we're interested in.

47:34.600 --> 47:36.360
 And it's going good, knock on wood.

47:36.360 --> 47:39.240
 But you know, it's something that when all of a sudden

47:39.240 --> 47:40.520
 you got too much time in your hands

47:40.520 --> 47:42.680
 and you're not doing and accomplishing much

47:42.680 --> 47:47.000
 that things probably, you know, get off track.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.360
 What do you think is the role of family in wrestling?

47:49.360 --> 47:50.960
 Can a man do it alone?

47:50.960 --> 47:55.520
 And if not, where's family most important?

47:55.520 --> 48:00.520
 You know, you can do it alone, but why would you want to?

48:00.600 --> 48:01.440
 Yeah.

48:01.440 --> 48:03.000
 I think the chances of doing it alone

48:03.000 --> 48:06.040
 are much less than the chances of doing it together.

48:07.940 --> 48:10.840
 I know they say, don't bring your profession home sometimes.

48:10.840 --> 48:15.840
 They say that, I never got away from my profession.

48:16.000 --> 48:21.000
 And you know, sometimes I, it's like my house right here.

48:21.000 --> 48:25.680
 So when I'm moving home and I'm not going to have an office

48:25.680 --> 48:27.240
 because I'm not going to coach anymore

48:27.240 --> 48:29.760
 or I'm not going to be an assistant athletic director

48:29.760 --> 48:34.320
 for a while, that you got to do something

48:34.320 --> 48:39.320
 that gives you a little bit of a break.

48:39.640 --> 48:42.600
 Not you necessarily, maybe the person you're living with.

48:42.600 --> 48:44.300
 And so I don't know if you looked outside there,

48:44.300 --> 48:45.840
 I got a cabin right out in my backyard.

48:45.840 --> 48:47.400
 You probably can't see it right there, but.

48:47.400 --> 48:48.760
 What's in the cabin?

48:48.760 --> 48:51.480
 That's my house away from my house.

48:51.480 --> 48:55.480
 It's only 30 feet from my house and it's my office

48:55.480 --> 48:57.440
 and it's my workout room.

48:57.440 --> 49:00.980
 I got a sauna there, it's a bed upstairs if I need it.

49:00.980 --> 49:03.380
 If I ever get too close and she says,

49:03.380 --> 49:05.480
 hey, why don't you go sleep in the other house?

49:05.480 --> 49:07.440
 But you know, it kicks me out of the bed, but.

49:07.440 --> 49:08.280
 Get the heck out.

49:08.280 --> 49:09.160
 It's never happened.

49:09.160 --> 49:11.720
 But I do spend a lot of time out there.

49:11.720 --> 49:15.000
 And it's, you know, you got to have a little distance

49:15.000 --> 49:18.960
 sometimes and you got to know your role.

49:18.960 --> 49:21.160
 And so all of a sudden when you're a guy that's been gone

49:21.160 --> 49:23.400
 your whole life from eight o clock in the morning

49:23.400 --> 49:25.440
 until close to seven, three or eight o clock at night.

49:25.440 --> 49:28.120
 So 11, 12 hours a day, then all of a sudden

49:28.120 --> 49:30.960
 you're not gone as much, even though you still work.

49:30.960 --> 49:32.160
 She's trying to slow me down now.

49:32.160 --> 49:35.040
 I'm doing not so much like here, what we're doing right now,

49:35.040 --> 49:37.360
 but it's when I get in the car and drive somewhere

49:37.360 --> 49:40.240
 or fly somewhere, you know, like just last night

49:40.240 --> 49:41.800
 I just went to bed and I hadn't told her

49:41.800 --> 49:45.240
 that this guy called me and he wants me to speak

49:45.240 --> 49:48.520
 for a bit, want to build another, wrestling wants

49:48.520 --> 49:51.640
 to start another wrestlers and business networking out

49:51.640 --> 49:55.880
 in Delaware because we don't have any colleges

49:55.880 --> 49:57.360
 in wrestling in Delaware.

49:57.360 --> 49:59.680
 And so I said, well, you know, I'm glad to do that

49:59.680 --> 50:01.240
 because that's my life, you know?

50:01.240 --> 50:04.560
 So, but then all of a sudden I didn't say anything

50:04.560 --> 50:07.160
 to my wife until all of a sudden this morning.

50:07.160 --> 50:09.480
 And I told her that I might go on the Friday

50:09.480 --> 50:11.280
 the 21st of December.

50:11.280 --> 50:12.400
 Oh no.

50:12.400 --> 50:14.720
 Well, I said, that's not Christmas.

50:14.720 --> 50:18.520
 She goes, we're celebrating Christmas that weekend early

50:18.520 --> 50:21.280
 because a lot of the family can't be here

50:21.280 --> 50:22.400
 except for that weekend.

50:22.400 --> 50:23.400
 Yeah.

50:23.400 --> 50:26.040
 And I said, oh, well, that's not gonna work.

50:26.040 --> 50:28.560
 But I kind of didn't say anything to her at first.

50:28.560 --> 50:30.400
 And then, well, I'll tell you,

50:30.400 --> 50:32.640
 she started getting a little emotional.

50:32.640 --> 50:36.920
 And if I want to stay married for another year, 45 years,

50:36.920 --> 50:41.720
 then I better tell those people that I got family

50:41.720 --> 50:46.720
 obligations because that depends what's most important.

50:48.120 --> 50:48.960
 I love wrestling.

50:48.960 --> 50:52.040
 I love wrestling and I want to start another,

50:52.040 --> 50:54.000
 start another wrestlers and business network.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.880
 But there's more than one Dan Gable out there.

50:55.880 --> 50:59.800
 Well, maybe not, but there's a lot of people

50:59.800 --> 51:04.800
 that are maybe even closer and they got big names.

51:05.040 --> 51:06.760
 I mean, we're doing pretty well right now.

51:06.760 --> 51:09.560
 I mean, we got first two years ago

51:09.560 --> 51:11.320
 and we got second this year.

51:12.320 --> 51:14.160
 And then we got the women's freestyles

51:14.160 --> 51:15.600
 doing good in wrestling.

51:15.600 --> 51:17.640
 We got to work a little bit on our Greco yet,

51:17.640 --> 51:20.280
 but they are working on it.

51:20.280 --> 51:25.280
 But our men's freestyle team right now are excellent.

51:25.560 --> 51:30.560
 And the key for them is to get them all on the same page

51:32.680 --> 51:35.960
 instead of just have new highlights.

51:35.960 --> 51:39.080
 And by that, I'm saying, you look and see who won this year.

51:39.080 --> 51:41.240
 Well, the three guys that have never won before

51:41.240 --> 51:42.080
 won this year.

51:42.080 --> 51:43.240
 We had three world champions.

51:43.240 --> 51:48.040
 Our two past world champions didn't win this year.

51:48.040 --> 51:51.760
 I mean, they did okay, they got medals.

51:51.760 --> 51:52.800
 Did Borrows win?

51:52.800 --> 51:54.120
 No, he did not.

51:54.120 --> 51:55.520
 He got third.

51:55.520 --> 51:56.880
 Oh, that's right, he got bronze, yeah.

51:56.880 --> 52:00.120
 And Sajilov got, I mean, Snyder got second.

52:00.120 --> 52:02.800
 So those two are our main guys.

52:02.800 --> 52:05.840
 So the three new guys that came through

52:05.840 --> 52:08.720
 were guys that hadn't won world gold.

52:08.720 --> 52:11.360
 In fact, two of them have never made a world team before.

52:11.360 --> 52:14.200
 And so we have three world champions this year,

52:14.200 --> 52:16.200
 but we needed all five of them to come through

52:16.200 --> 52:18.440
 to win the championships.

52:18.440 --> 52:22.880
 And so the key really is getting them all to do the same

52:22.880 --> 52:25.680
 at the same time, year in and year out,

52:25.680 --> 52:30.440
 and not just based on, okay, Borrows got beat this year,

52:30.440 --> 52:32.160
 so he'll win next year.

52:32.160 --> 52:34.640
 It's gotta be every year if you're capable of doing that.

52:34.640 --> 52:36.760
 And that's what the coaching staff has to do.

52:36.760 --> 52:39.000
 What's kind of funny that I do have a lot of influence

52:39.000 --> 52:41.960
 actually on the coaching staffs right now at the USA level

52:41.960 --> 52:46.740
 because the women's freestyle guy is Terry Steiner.

52:46.740 --> 52:49.040
 And he wrestled for me, he was a national champion.

52:49.040 --> 52:52.240
 He's got a twin brother that's at Fresno State.

52:52.240 --> 52:56.560
 And then Billy Zaddik is the freestyle coach

52:56.560 --> 53:00.380
 and he wrestled for the Hawkeyes back in the early days.

53:00.380 --> 53:02.040
 And he was the national champion.

53:02.040 --> 53:06.800
 So we've got a lot of former Gable influence on there,

53:06.800 --> 53:07.640
 but it's.

53:07.640 --> 53:08.880
 You got deep roots in there.

53:08.880 --> 53:12.160
 In 2013, the International Olympic Committee, IOC,

53:12.160 --> 53:14.500
 voted wrestling out of the Olympics.

53:14.500 --> 53:17.320
 So a lot of folks know about this,

53:17.320 --> 53:20.040
 the absurdity of it and so on.

53:20.040 --> 53:22.480
 But in a big picture, you can step back now,

53:22.480 --> 53:23.520
 it's five years later.

53:23.520 --> 53:26.820
 What did you learn from that experience?

53:26.820 --> 53:31.160
 Well, first of all, did it surprise me?

53:31.160 --> 53:32.880
 Yeah.

53:32.880 --> 53:35.500
 But did it really surprise me?

53:35.500 --> 53:36.340
 No.

53:38.680 --> 53:39.800
 You gotta run.

53:39.800 --> 53:44.000
 You gotta have people running the organization

53:45.200 --> 53:46.920
 that are top notch.

53:48.080 --> 53:50.280
 If you take anything for granted

53:51.320 --> 53:53.840
 and you're not the person of authority,

53:53.840 --> 53:56.520
 somebody can kick you out.

53:57.640 --> 54:00.240
 And even though we had a lot of authority

54:00.240 --> 54:01.680
 because we're wrestling,

54:01.680 --> 54:05.400
 we're one of the first sports in the Olympics ever,

54:05.400 --> 54:10.400
 and that we think that we're in 180 some countries

54:12.140 --> 54:17.140
 and some of the number one countries in the world

54:18.180 --> 54:22.560
 that are politically strong have the sport,

54:22.560 --> 54:23.440
 we thought we were okay.

54:23.440 --> 54:26.200
 But then you gotta look and see who's running the IOC.

54:26.200 --> 54:31.200
 The IOC, the International Olympic Committee.

54:32.680 --> 54:35.860
 And then you gotta see that in wrestling,

54:35.860 --> 54:37.620
 we don't have anybody in there.

54:37.620 --> 54:39.380
 I mean, that shocked me.

54:39.380 --> 54:43.840
 We've never had anybody on the IOC from wrestling.

54:43.840 --> 54:45.020
 You know why?

54:45.020 --> 54:50.020
 Because we didn't have to, but yes, that's wrong.

54:50.400 --> 54:51.900
 You have to.

54:51.900 --> 54:55.620
 And if you don't have somebody looking out for you

54:55.620 --> 54:57.280
 right within the structure,

54:58.540 --> 55:01.220
 then it's pretty easy for people to turn their head.

55:01.220 --> 55:06.220
 But all it took was the statement,

55:07.000 --> 55:08.740
 you guys are kicked out of the Olympics.

55:08.740 --> 55:09.740
 You guys are done.

55:09.740 --> 55:11.460
 Everybody came together.

55:11.460 --> 55:14.660
 Well, yeah, I mean, it's the first time in history

55:14.660 --> 55:18.060
 that probably all this competitive people

55:18.060 --> 55:20.860
 that were working for their own agenda

55:20.860 --> 55:25.360
 turned that agenda to the sport.

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
 So that made a big difference and we got a lot done.

55:30.000 --> 55:35.000
 In fact, in America, there was several people

55:35.400 --> 55:40.400
 that were really out there that we didn't know about

55:40.560 --> 55:42.560
 until this point in time.

55:42.560 --> 55:46.540
 And when they came aboard, now they're still aboard.

55:47.800 --> 55:50.280
 That doesn't mean we're doing everything perfect

55:50.280 --> 55:52.200
 because just because we got voted back in

55:52.200 --> 55:54.660
 before we even got kicked out really,

55:54.660 --> 55:57.460
 that doesn't mean we're by any means safe.

55:58.360 --> 56:00.920
 We have to do some of the things that I'm talking about

56:00.920 --> 56:03.760
 or some of the things that we didn't do before.

56:03.760 --> 56:06.440
 We can't fall right back into the same mess.

56:06.440 --> 56:11.420
 And so our leadership got changed and it's better,

56:11.420 --> 56:13.320
 but it's gotta stay better.

56:13.320 --> 56:18.000
 But there are things that we could still be doing

56:18.000 --> 56:22.760
 to make sure that we don't have situations like this happen.

56:22.760 --> 56:24.560
 I'll tell you, when I first learned about it,

56:24.560 --> 56:29.080
 I was like, I broke down and wept again.

56:29.080 --> 56:30.080
 It's like every once in a while,

56:30.080 --> 56:35.080
 I'll break down and cry about my sister

56:35.560 --> 56:38.520
 or I'll break down, I don't know if I cry

56:38.520 --> 56:42.080
 about losing the owings, but I probably get more determined.

56:42.080 --> 56:45.400
 But that's kind of, you have to go back

56:45.400 --> 56:47.800
 and think about those moments when you heard,

56:47.800 --> 56:52.800
 when I heard that moment and it just overcame me.

56:53.980 --> 56:56.840
 It was like four o clock, 4.30 in the morning

56:56.840 --> 56:57.680
 when I heard about it.

56:57.680 --> 57:00.400
 And my wife had been up looking at the internet

57:00.400 --> 57:03.000
 and she woke me up and I thought she was joking,

57:03.000 --> 57:05.600
 but I jumped out of bed really quick when she said that.

57:05.600 --> 57:07.080
 I knew she was serious.

57:07.080 --> 57:10.680
 And I started making phone calls right then

57:10.680 --> 57:11.960
 to find out if it was true.

57:11.960 --> 57:13.320
 And when I found out it was true,

57:13.320 --> 57:14.720
 it was just like devastating.

57:14.720 --> 57:19.720
 And it was one of these things that it's a nightmare,

57:20.160 --> 57:24.400
 and, but you don't let it happen again.

57:24.400 --> 57:26.040
 It's that simple.

57:26.040 --> 57:27.680
 You keep getting stronger.

57:27.680 --> 57:30.880
 Yeah, and if people haven't read,

57:30.880 --> 57:32.480
 they should read The Loss of Dan Gable

57:32.480 --> 57:34.600
 by Ray Thompson, the ESPN article.

57:34.600 --> 57:37.000
 That kind of, in this very beautiful poetic way,

57:38.240 --> 57:42.840
 ties together all the losses of Dan Gable,

57:42.840 --> 57:46.560
 the losing your sister, losing to Larry Owens,

57:46.560 --> 57:48.680
 losing wrestling from the Olympics,

57:48.680 --> 57:52.260
 all of these tragedies of various forms.

57:53.920 --> 57:57.960
 So that's, well, the IOC, there's politics,

57:57.960 --> 58:00.080
 and you're sort of being very pragmatic.

58:00.080 --> 58:03.480
 But stepping back, wrestling is one of the oldest forms

58:03.480 --> 58:04.920
 of combat, period.

58:04.920 --> 58:08.560
 Dating back, there's cave drawings 15,000 years ago.

58:08.560 --> 58:11.560
 And if you look at the ancient Olympics,

58:11.560 --> 58:13.880
 the Greek Olympics, 2,700 years ago,

58:14.840 --> 58:17.280
 did you ever, when you wrestled or coached,

58:17.280 --> 58:20.720
 do you now see wrestling in this way,

58:20.720 --> 58:22.520
 freestyle and folk style wrestling,

58:22.520 --> 58:26.560
 the purity of sort of two human beings locked in combat,

58:26.560 --> 58:30.400
 the roots of that as just human beings,

58:30.400 --> 58:34.400
 this fair struggle between two men or two women?

58:34.400 --> 58:37.480
 I don't think I ever looked at it

58:37.480 --> 58:42.480
 as anything but just a combat.

58:43.320 --> 58:48.320
 And I think there's times that have made me

58:50.080 --> 58:52.280
 figure out how to make that combat better.

58:53.340 --> 58:58.340
 There's little markers or little points in time in your life

58:58.340 --> 59:06.080
 that make you wonder, or I should say determined,

59:06.080 --> 59:10.040
 to be able to get more out of yourself

59:10.040 --> 59:13.080
 and to be able to take it to a new level.

59:13.080 --> 59:16.400
 And I don't think people can actually feel that way

59:16.400 --> 59:19.480
 unless you've actually had a lot of accomplishments

59:19.480 --> 59:20.920
 in anything.

59:20.920 --> 59:22.400
 I think there's anything out there.

59:22.400 --> 59:24.080
 I mean, no matter what sport

59:24.080 --> 59:26.320
 or breaking the four minute mile,

59:26.320 --> 59:29.480
 I mean, when you broke that, when they broke that,

59:29.480 --> 59:31.600
 Roger Bannister broke that four minute mile,

59:31.600 --> 59:33.260
 I can't imagine him breaking it

59:33.260 --> 59:36.080
 from his best time being 4.30.

59:37.440 --> 59:41.080
 It's one of these things that along the line

59:41.080 --> 59:44.560
 that he did had some close calls

59:45.480 --> 59:49.000
 or he had some coaching that was giving him

59:49.000 --> 59:50.980
 the opportunity to become a little better.

59:50.980 --> 59:54.440
 But I think because he was doing well

59:54.440 --> 59:58.480
 and being very successful, that the opportunity came.

59:58.480 --> 1:00:00.720
 And so it's for me, it's like the same thing.

1:00:00.720 --> 1:00:03.920
 I had so much success

1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:08.400
 and so many practices that went well

1:00:09.280 --> 1:00:13.040
 and so much goodness out of this sport

1:00:14.080 --> 1:00:19.080
 that it gave me the opportunity to really look more finite

1:00:21.440 --> 1:00:23.880
 and look more how I can even make it better.

1:00:23.880 --> 1:00:27.760
 And so it's like, if you look at my library upstairs,

1:00:27.760 --> 1:00:29.400
 I got a library upstairs

1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:35.840
 and there's a lot of books up there from the family.

1:00:35.880 --> 1:00:38.040
 But if you look at the Gable books up there,

1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:42.360
 I got a lot of Russian technique books.

1:00:42.360 --> 1:00:47.360
 I can't read the book, but I can see the diagrams

1:00:49.400 --> 1:00:52.120
 and I can see the figures.

1:00:52.120 --> 1:00:54.200
 They don't really show it in pictures.

1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:55.760
 They do it in drawings.

1:00:56.920 --> 1:01:01.420
 And so it was like when I was trying to beat the best

1:01:01.420 --> 1:01:04.040
 that has labeled the best

1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:07.120
 because they win the world championships every year

1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:09.920
 since they've been just about involved.

1:01:09.920 --> 1:01:11.440
 And I don't think they got started involved

1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:16.320
 till like the fifties, but it's something,

1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:19.640
 you study the best who's out there,

1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:23.680
 but then you don't focus so much on the best

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:25.720
 that you can't beat the best.

1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:27.560
 You learn from them,

1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:29.840
 but there's something that they don't have

1:01:31.300 --> 1:01:32.960
 that you can have.

1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:36.600
 Toughness to technique, to the art, to the science.

1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:37.660
 Yeah, all that stuff.

1:01:37.660 --> 1:01:39.380
 And that's why I even talking to you

1:01:39.380 --> 1:01:41.680
 and you're sitting over there and you love MIT

1:01:41.680 --> 1:01:43.920
 and you're bragging about it over Harvard.

1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:47.640
 Cause it's true.

1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:50.000
 In your eyes and that's great.

1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:54.100
 And it might be, but it's the same type of thing

1:01:54.100 --> 1:01:57.680
 that there's something that you're probably stealing

1:01:57.680 --> 1:02:01.120
 from Harvard, but you won't give them credit.

1:02:01.120 --> 1:02:03.740
 Well, Dan, in the interest of time,

1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:07.240
 I've read that you're pretty serious.

1:02:07.240 --> 1:02:10.000
 You're pretty seriously into fishing.

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:12.100
 So what's the biggest fish you ever caught?

1:02:15.640 --> 1:02:16.840
 What are we talking about here?

1:02:16.840 --> 1:02:18.040
 What are we talking about?

1:02:18.040 --> 1:02:22.140
 No, I don't think I've ever caught a big ocean fish.

1:02:22.140 --> 1:02:24.140
 I'm not, I'm a river lake fisherman.

1:02:24.140 --> 1:02:25.640
 I have fish in the...

1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:26.480
 Trout?

1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:30.000
 No, probably Northern.

1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:33.400
 I probably caught a Northern that weighed 20 some pounds.

1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:37.600
 The fish I like to catch is walleyes.

1:02:37.600 --> 1:02:39.320
 And the reason why I like to catch them

1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:41.760
 cause they're really good eating fish.

1:02:41.760 --> 1:02:44.300
 And the best eating fish are not the real big ones.

1:02:44.300 --> 1:02:47.820
 It's kind of interesting.

1:02:47.820 --> 1:02:50.060
 I got people hunting deer right on my land

1:02:50.060 --> 1:02:52.260
 and they're looking for the big bucks,

1:02:52.260 --> 1:02:54.840
 but they're not the best eaters if you want to eat,

1:02:54.840 --> 1:02:56.260
 but they're the best trophy.

1:02:56.260 --> 1:02:59.460
 So I do have a couple of trophy walleyes on the wall,

1:02:59.460 --> 1:03:03.060
 but most of the time I throw the big ones back

1:03:03.060 --> 1:03:05.020
 and put them back in there.

1:03:05.020 --> 1:03:07.300
 I don't know if you know there's a book by Hemingway

1:03:07.300 --> 1:03:08.700
 called Old Man in the Sea.

1:03:09.580 --> 1:03:10.420
 Heard of it.

1:03:11.300 --> 1:03:12.120
 Ernest Hemingway?

1:03:12.120 --> 1:03:13.740
 Ernest Hemingway, yeah.

1:03:13.740 --> 1:03:16.380
 And there's an old man that basically

1:03:17.580 --> 1:03:19.800
 catches an 18 footer, but it can't pull it in,

1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:20.640
 doesn't have the strength.

1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:24.380
 So they together spend while the sharks eat away at it.

1:03:24.380 --> 1:03:26.580
 I mean, this is very powerful story.

1:03:26.580 --> 1:03:27.860
 I think one of the Nobel Prize,

1:03:27.860 --> 1:03:30.940
 but he says, it's better to be lucky.

1:03:30.940 --> 1:03:33.220
 The old man says, it's better to be lucky,

1:03:33.220 --> 1:03:36.820
 but I would rather be exact that way

1:03:36.820 --> 1:03:38.740
 when luck comes, you're ready.

1:03:38.740 --> 1:03:43.300
 So let me ask, what do you think about luck?

1:03:43.300 --> 1:03:47.180
 Do you believe in free will that we have actions

1:03:47.180 --> 1:03:49.980
 that control the direction, destination of our life,

1:03:49.980 --> 1:03:53.620
 or does luck and some other outside forces

1:03:53.620 --> 1:03:56.740
 really land you where you end up?

1:03:57.780 --> 1:04:00.480
 For me, I'm not about luck,

1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:04.960
 but I do think luck is involved.

1:04:04.960 --> 1:04:06.720
 But I think it's mostly created,

1:04:07.900 --> 1:04:11.020
 just how lucky you are through preparations.

1:04:11.020 --> 1:04:14.920
 And things have happened in my life forever,

1:04:16.540 --> 1:04:18.340
 and a lot of good things.

1:04:18.340 --> 1:04:19.580
 And a lot of people could say,

1:04:19.580 --> 1:04:22.780
 hey, you've been pretty lucky to win all these awards.

1:04:22.780 --> 1:04:27.180
 I don't know, if you analyze my life,

1:04:27.180 --> 1:04:29.840
 I don't think it was involved with luck.

1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:32.100
 I think it was more involved with preparation.

1:04:32.100 --> 1:04:36.100
 And again, science, had you been smarter,

1:04:36.100 --> 1:04:39.820
 had you understood that you could do some things

1:04:39.820 --> 1:04:42.020
 and be just as lucky, that'd be great.

1:04:42.020 --> 1:04:45.120
 But I'm only as smart as today.

1:04:46.300 --> 1:04:48.280
 So when I was training in my life,

1:04:48.280 --> 1:04:51.260
 and me even training people in my life,

1:04:52.460 --> 1:04:54.860
 as of that moment, that's how lucky I am

1:04:54.860 --> 1:04:59.860
 to be able to have whatever is available to me.

1:05:00.140 --> 1:05:01.860
 And that's what, you call that a lot of science.

1:05:01.860 --> 1:05:06.860
 So for me, I think that, like right now, if I look back,

1:05:07.060 --> 1:05:09.300
 I do a lot of things different,

1:05:09.300 --> 1:05:12.740
 just because things are proven differently.

1:05:12.740 --> 1:05:17.380
 Like I'd give people water during practice, and I did.

1:05:17.380 --> 1:05:20.100
 And I would let them change their wrestling shoes

1:05:20.100 --> 1:05:23.460
 into running shoes to run sprints on the concrete.

1:05:23.460 --> 1:05:27.980
 Or I would actually, maybe I've had a guy climb 12 ropes

1:05:27.980 --> 1:05:30.360
 after practice, one after another.

1:05:30.360 --> 1:05:32.460
 And then maybe the next day I'd do it again.

1:05:32.460 --> 1:05:35.200
 Ah, I might not make him do it the next day.

1:05:35.200 --> 1:05:38.180
 I might let him recover a little bit more.

1:05:38.180 --> 1:05:43.180
 And you gotta learn, keep adding to your philosophy.

1:05:43.660 --> 1:05:46.540
 And your philosophy may have been great at that time,

1:05:46.540 --> 1:05:48.460
 but it's at that time.

1:05:48.460 --> 1:05:51.500
 And what is really important is where you at

1:05:51.500 --> 1:05:53.900
 with this time, today.

1:05:53.900 --> 1:05:56.420
 And so there's better ways to do things.

1:05:56.420 --> 1:05:59.040
 Now, if you ever take attitude out of it,

1:05:59.040 --> 1:06:02.040
 and just depend on total science,

1:06:03.300 --> 1:06:05.040
 then you're not gonna be as,

1:06:05.040 --> 1:06:08.720
 as you know, I think as I listened to a couple people

1:06:08.720 --> 1:06:11.640
 that are really pretty famous people.

1:06:11.640 --> 1:06:13.040
 One of them was John Irving.

1:06:13.040 --> 1:06:15.080
 He was a writer.

1:06:15.080 --> 1:06:16.360
 And he told me, he says,

1:06:16.360 --> 1:06:21.200
 you think I really learned how to be a great writer

1:06:21.200 --> 1:06:24.660
 in writing school?

1:06:26.920 --> 1:06:29.680
 He said, yeah, I learned a lot there.

1:06:29.680 --> 1:06:34.680
 But really what gave me the ability to stay focused,

1:06:35.440 --> 1:06:38.680
 to work extra hours, to be more disciplined,

1:06:38.680 --> 1:06:40.320
 was wrestling practices.

1:06:41.240 --> 1:06:42.800
 That's right, he was a wrestler, yeah.

1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:44.720
 Yeah, he goes, I go back to that.

1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:46.420
 That's what gave me that chance.

1:06:47.400 --> 1:06:52.400
 And there's a guy in Iowa, that guy named Norman Borlaug.

1:06:52.400 --> 1:06:57.400
 He learned, he invented a process

1:06:57.640 --> 1:07:02.420
 to feed the underprivileged countries of the world.

1:07:02.420 --> 1:07:06.680
 And he was a wrestler, and he said the same thing.

1:07:06.680 --> 1:07:08.720
 And he worked extremely hard.

1:07:08.720 --> 1:07:11.200
 And he said, I give a lot of credit

1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:13.120
 to the sport of wrestling.

1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:15.400
 And even though I'm known for this,

1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:18.340
 and I got a statue in Washington, DC,

1:07:18.340 --> 1:07:21.340
 because I saved a billion lives plus,

1:07:21.340 --> 1:07:23.800
 I'm gonna give wrestling a lot of credit.

1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:28.800
 So I think some of these MMA stars

1:07:29.440 --> 1:07:32.940
 and some of these guys that maybe weren't wrestlers,

1:07:32.940 --> 1:07:36.760
 that had to wrestle, had to fight wrestling guys and stuff,

1:07:36.760 --> 1:07:38.280
 missed a little bit there.

1:07:38.280 --> 1:07:40.560
 But I think the ones that did have wrestling

1:07:40.560 --> 1:07:41.920
 probably have a really good chance

1:07:41.920 --> 1:07:43.480
 and can adapt to the other ones.

1:07:43.480 --> 1:07:48.320
 But I think every martial art or every activity is good,

1:07:48.320 --> 1:07:49.800
 and you probably can't skip any.

1:07:49.800 --> 1:07:51.920
 But I don't think they're ever gonna overlook

1:07:51.920 --> 1:07:56.920
 and say that wrestling's not valuable, because it is.

1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:00.560
 However, that doesn't mean you're gonna make it.

1:08:00.560 --> 1:08:03.400
 You still gotta take the values and apply it,

1:08:03.400 --> 1:08:05.640
 whatever area you're gonna be in.

1:08:05.640 --> 1:08:07.400
 And some people forget that.

1:08:07.400 --> 1:08:12.180
 Some people can't get over the highness

1:08:12.180 --> 1:08:15.400
 of getting your arm raised in a wrestling match.

1:08:15.400 --> 1:08:16.440
 And you know what?

1:08:16.440 --> 1:08:20.080
 What's even greater than me getting my arm raised

1:08:20.080 --> 1:08:23.300
 is that if I'm a coach or if I belong with you,

1:08:23.300 --> 1:08:25.520
 that you get your arm raised.

1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:27.360
 And even if you don't get your arm raised,

1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:29.200
 it's what you walk away with

1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:33.840
 and how you learn to handle that as well.

1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:35.820
 Because there's gonna be some losses,

1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:37.720
 but you don't want many.

1:08:37.720 --> 1:08:39.580
 Because you don't wanna get used to losing,

1:08:39.580 --> 1:08:40.520
 I can tell you that.

1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:42.240
 So it's the hunger for the win.

1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:45.320
 It's the brotherhood, the sisterhood of the wrestling room.

1:08:45.320 --> 1:08:46.960
 And it's hard work and science

1:08:46.960 --> 1:08:49.920
 that's gonna beat luck at the end of the day.

1:08:49.920 --> 1:08:54.500
 Absolutely, that luck, I like luck,

1:08:54.500 --> 1:08:57.920
 but I think it's created by the opportunity that...

1:08:57.920 --> 1:08:58.880
 You make your luck.

1:08:58.880 --> 1:09:00.120
 You make your luck, yeah.

1:09:00.120 --> 1:09:01.960
 Dan, it was a huge honor.

1:09:38.160 --> 1:09:41.280
 The first period is won by the best technician.

1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:44.920
 The second period is won by the kid in the best shape.

1:09:44.920 --> 1:09:47.640
 And the third period is won by the kid

1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:48.740
