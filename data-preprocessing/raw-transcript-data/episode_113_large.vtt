00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
 The following is a conversation with Manolis Kellis.

00:03.080 --> 00:05.440
 He's a professor at MIT and head

00:05.440 --> 00:08.400
 of the MIT Computational Biology Group.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.280
 He's interested in understanding the human genome

00:11.280 --> 00:14.160
 from a computational, evolutionary, biological,

00:14.160 --> 00:17.000
 and other cross disciplinary perspectives.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.160
 He has more big, impactful papers and awards

00:20.160 --> 00:22.480
 than I can list, but most importantly,

00:22.480 --> 00:26.240
 he's a kind, curious, brilliant human being,

00:26.240 --> 00:28.720
 and just someone I really enjoy talking to.

00:28.720 --> 00:32.960
 His passion for science and life in general is contagious.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.640
 The hours honestly flew by,

00:34.640 --> 00:37.720
 and I'm sure we'll talk again on this podcast soon.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.120
 Quick summary of the ads.

01:35.400 --> 01:38.960
 I'm a big believer in reading at least an hour every day.

01:38.960 --> 01:41.920
 As part of that, I use Blinkist every day

01:41.920 --> 01:43.920
 to try out a book I may otherwise

01:43.920 --> 01:45.560
 never have a chance to read.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.720
 It controls temperature with a nap

02:26.720 --> 02:29.200
 and can cool down to as low as 55 degrees

02:29.200 --> 02:31.480
 on each side of the bed separately.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.840
 Research shows that temperature has a big impact

02:33.840 --> 02:35.680
 on the quality of our sleep.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.840
 Anecdotally, as been true for me,

02:37.840 --> 02:39.840
 it's truly been a game changer.

02:39.840 --> 02:40.880
 I love it.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.400
 The pod pro is packed with sensors

02:42.400 --> 02:44.560
 that track heart rate, heart rate variability

02:44.560 --> 02:48.120
 and respiratory rate, showing it all in their app.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.080
 The app's health metrics are amazing

02:50.080 --> 02:52.880
 but the cooling alone is honestly worth the money.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.040
 When I first heard about Masterclass,

03:07.040 --> 03:09.000
 I thought it was too good to be true.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.080

03:35.880 --> 03:38.720
 and the experience of being launched into space alone

03:38.720 --> 03:40.040
 is worth the money.

03:49.600 --> 03:53.480
 And now, here's my conversation with Manolis Kellis.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.880
 What to you is the most beautiful aspect

03:56.880 --> 03:58.640
 of the human genome?

03:58.640 --> 04:00.040
 Don't get me started.

04:00.040 --> 04:04.280
 So. We've got time.

04:04.280 --> 04:06.360
 The first answer is that the beauty of genomes

04:06.360 --> 04:07.680
 transcends humanity.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.440
 So it's not just about the human genome.

04:09.440 --> 04:12.640
 Genomes in general are amazingly beautiful.

04:12.640 --> 04:14.040
 And again, I'm obviously biased.

04:14.040 --> 04:18.680
 So in my view, the way that I like to introduce

04:18.680 --> 04:20.840
 the human genome and the way that I like to introduce

04:20.840 --> 04:22.920
 genomics to my class is by telling them,

04:22.920 --> 04:24.960
 you know, we're not the inventors

04:24.960 --> 04:26.560
 of the first digital computer.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.320
 We are the descendants of the first digital computer.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.360
 Basically, life is digital.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.600
 And that's absolutely beautiful about life.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.080
 The fact that at every replication step,

04:37.080 --> 04:38.480
 you don't lose any information

04:38.480 --> 04:40.040
 because that information is digital.

04:40.040 --> 04:43.160
 If it was analog, if it was just sprouting concentrations,

04:43.160 --> 04:44.640
 you'd lose it after a few generations.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.360
 It would just dissolve away.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.240
 And that's what the ancients

04:48.240 --> 04:50.080
 didn't understand about inheritance.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.120
 The first person to understand digital inheritance

04:52.120 --> 04:54.440
 was Mendel, of course.

04:54.440 --> 04:57.600
 And his theory, in fact, stayed in a bookshelf

04:57.600 --> 05:00.720
 for like 50 years while Darwin was getting famous

05:00.720 --> 05:02.440
 about natural selection.

05:02.440 --> 05:05.440
 But the missing component was this digital inheritance,

05:05.440 --> 05:09.720
 the mechanism of evolution that Mendel had discovered.

05:09.720 --> 05:13.120
 So that aspect in my view is the most beautiful aspect

05:13.120 --> 05:14.880
 but it transcends all of life.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.040
 And can you elaborate maybe the inheritance part?

05:18.040 --> 05:22.480
 What was the key thing that the ancients didn't understand?

05:22.480 --> 05:27.480
 So the very theory of inheritance as discrete units,

05:28.520 --> 05:32.880
 throughout the life of Mendel and well after he's writing,

05:32.880 --> 05:35.240
 people thought that his P experiments

05:35.240 --> 05:36.600
 were just a little fluke,

05:36.600 --> 05:38.760
 that they were just a little exception

05:38.760 --> 05:41.840
 that would normally not even apply to humans,

05:41.840 --> 05:44.200
 that basically what they saw

05:44.200 --> 05:48.080
 is this continuum of eye color,

05:48.080 --> 05:49.760
 this continuum of skin color,

05:49.760 --> 05:51.120
 this continuum of hair color,

05:51.120 --> 05:52.520
 this continuum of height.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.080
 And all of these continuums did not fit

05:55.080 --> 05:56.800
 with a discrete type of inheritance

05:56.800 --> 05:58.920
 that Mendel was describing.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.480
 But what's unique about genomics

06:00.480 --> 06:01.640
 and what's unique about the genome

06:01.640 --> 06:03.840
 is really that there are two copies

06:03.840 --> 06:06.240
 and that you get a combination of these.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.200
 But for every trait,

06:08.200 --> 06:10.720
 there are dozens of contributing variables.

06:10.720 --> 06:14.000
 And it was only Ronald Fisher in the 20th century

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
 that basically recognized that even five Mendelian traits

06:20.120 --> 06:24.920
 would add up to a continuum like inheritance pattern.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.520
 And he wrote a series of papers

06:27.520 --> 06:30.360
 that still are very relevant today

06:30.360 --> 06:32.960
 about sort of this Mendelian inheritance

06:32.960 --> 06:35.200
 of continuum like traits.

06:35.200 --> 06:38.520
 And I think that that was the missing step in inheritance.

06:38.520 --> 06:41.560
 So well before the discovery of the structure of DNA,

06:41.560 --> 06:44.400
 which is again, another amazingly beautiful aspect,

06:44.400 --> 06:45.240
 the double helix,

06:45.240 --> 06:48.480
 what I like to call the most noble molecule of our time,

06:50.320 --> 06:54.080
 holds within it the secret of that discrete inheritance,

06:54.080 --> 06:58.480
 but the conceptualization of discrete elements

06:58.480 --> 06:59.680
 is something that precedes that.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.440
 So even though it's discrete,

07:01.440 --> 07:06.440
 when it materializes itself into actual traits that we see,

07:06.560 --> 07:08.000
 it can be continuous.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.840
 Basically arbitrarily rich and complex.

07:10.840 --> 07:15.000
 So if you have five genes that contribute to human height,

07:15.000 --> 07:16.960
 and there aren't five, there's a thousand.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.440
 If there's only five genes

07:18.440 --> 07:20.880
 and you inherit some combination of them,

07:20.880 --> 07:23.080
 and every one makes you two inches taller

07:23.080 --> 07:24.520
 or two inches shorter,

07:24.520 --> 07:27.440
 it'll look like a continuous trait.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.440
 But instead of five, there are thousands.

07:30.440 --> 07:33.880
 And every one of them contributes to less than one millimeter.

07:33.880 --> 07:36.920
 We change in height more during the day

07:36.920 --> 07:39.280
 than each of these genetic variants contributes.

07:40.160 --> 07:43.960
 So by the evening, you're shorter than you walk up with.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.320
 Isn't that weird then

07:45.320 --> 07:48.080
 that we're not more different than we are?

07:48.080 --> 07:49.680
 Why are we all so similar

07:49.680 --> 07:52.600
 if there's so much possibility to be different?

07:52.600 --> 07:57.480
 Yeah, so there are selective advantages to being medium.

07:57.480 --> 07:59.920
 If you're extremely tall or extremely short,

07:59.920 --> 08:02.280
 you run into selective disadvantages.

08:02.280 --> 08:04.160
 So you have trouble breathing, you have trouble running,

08:04.160 --> 08:06.320
 you have trouble sitting if you're too tall.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.240
 If you're too short, you might, I don't know,

08:08.240 --> 08:11.000
 have other selective pressures are acting against that.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.600
 If you look at natural history of human population,

08:13.600 --> 08:17.000
 there's actually selection for height in Northern Europe

08:17.000 --> 08:19.960
 and selection against height in Southern Europe.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.800
 So there might actually be advantages

08:21.800 --> 08:25.000
 to actually being not super tall.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.720
 And if you look across the entire human population,

08:28.720 --> 08:29.840
 for many, many traits,

08:29.840 --> 08:32.080
 there's a lot of push towards the middle.

08:32.080 --> 08:35.280
 Balancing selection is the usual term

08:35.280 --> 08:39.680
 for selection that sort of seeks to not be extreme

08:39.680 --> 08:43.600
 and to sort of have a combination of alleles

08:43.600 --> 08:45.920
 that sort of keep recombining.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.640
 And if you look at mate selection,

08:48.640 --> 08:50.320
 super, super tall people

08:50.320 --> 08:53.360
 will not tend to sort of marry super, super tall people.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.200
 Very often you see these couples

08:55.200 --> 08:57.960
 that are kind of compensating for each other.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.440
 And the best predictor of the kid's age

09:00.440 --> 09:03.520
 is very often just take the average of the two parents

09:03.520 --> 09:07.080
 and then adjust for sex and boom, you get it.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.520
 It's extremely heritable.

09:08.520 --> 09:12.680
 Let me ask, you kind of took a step back to the genome

09:12.680 --> 09:13.880
 outside of just humans,

09:13.880 --> 09:15.880
 but is there something that you find beautiful

09:15.880 --> 09:18.600
 about the human genome specifically?

09:18.600 --> 09:21.360
 So I think the genome,

09:21.360 --> 09:24.440
 if more people understood the beauty of the human genome,

09:24.440 --> 09:26.600
 there would be so many fewer wars,

09:26.600 --> 09:28.960
 so much less anger in the world.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.400
 I mean, what's really beautiful about the human genome

09:31.400 --> 09:33.840
 is really the variation

09:33.840 --> 09:36.520
 that teaches us both about individuality

09:36.520 --> 09:38.200
 and about similarity.

09:38.200 --> 09:42.360
 So any two people on the planet are 99.9% identical.

09:43.440 --> 09:47.280
 How can you fight with someone who's 99.9% identical to you?

09:47.280 --> 09:49.680
 It's just counterintuitive.

09:49.680 --> 09:53.880
 And yet any two siblings of the same parents

09:53.880 --> 09:57.080
 differ in millions of locations.

09:57.080 --> 10:01.000
 So every one of them is basically two to the million unique

10:01.000 --> 10:03.120
 from any pair of parents,

10:03.120 --> 10:05.760
 let alone any two random parents on the planet.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.520
 So that's, I think, something that teaches us

10:08.520 --> 10:11.240
 about sort of the nature of humanity in many ways,

10:11.240 --> 10:14.640
 that every one of us is as unique as any star

10:14.640 --> 10:17.160
 and way more unique in actually many ways.

10:17.160 --> 10:22.160
 And yet we're all brothers and sisters.

10:22.160 --> 10:26.160
 Yeah, just like stars, most of it is just fusion reactions.

10:26.160 --> 10:29.280
 Yeah, you only have a few parameters to describe stars.

10:29.280 --> 10:33.120
 Mass, size, initial size, and stage of life.

10:33.120 --> 10:36.360
 Whereas for humans, it's thousands of parameters

10:36.360 --> 10:38.080
 scattered across our genome.

10:38.080 --> 10:41.360
 So the other thing that makes humans unique,

10:41.360 --> 10:45.240
 the other things that makes inheritance unique in humans

10:45.240 --> 10:50.240
 is that most species inherit things vertically.

10:50.360 --> 10:54.480
 Basically instinct is a huge part of their behavior.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.560
 The way that, I mean, with my kids,

10:57.560 --> 11:00.960
 we've been watching this nest of birds

11:00.960 --> 11:03.560
 with two little eggs outside our window

11:03.560 --> 11:05.200
 for the last few months,

11:05.200 --> 11:07.440
 for the last few weeks as they've been growing.

11:07.440 --> 11:12.240
 And there's so much behavior that's hard coded.

11:12.240 --> 11:16.000
 Birds don't just learn as they grow.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.160
 There's no culture.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.480
 Like a bird that's born in Boston

11:19.480 --> 11:22.040
 will be the same as a bird that's born in California.

11:22.040 --> 11:27.040
 So there's not as much inheritance of ideas, of customs.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.520
 A lot of it is hard coding in their genome.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.280
 What's really beautiful about the human genome

11:32.280 --> 11:35.000
 is that if you take a person from today

11:35.000 --> 11:37.080
 and you place them back in ancient Egypt,

11:37.080 --> 11:39.120
 or if you take a person from ancient Egypt

11:39.120 --> 11:41.160
 and you place them here today,

11:41.160 --> 11:43.200
 they will grow up to be completely normal.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.680
 That is not genetics.

11:47.680 --> 11:51.840
 This is the other type of inheritance in humans.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.880
 So on one hand, we have the genetic inheritance,

11:53.880 --> 11:56.160
 which is vertical from your parents down.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.400
 On the other hand, we have horizontal inheritance,

11:58.400 --> 12:02.400
 which is the ideas that are built up at every generation

12:02.400 --> 12:04.600
 are horizontally transmitted.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.560
 And the huge amount of time

12:06.560 --> 12:09.480
 that we spend in educating ourselves,

12:09.480 --> 12:11.920
 a concept known as neoteny,

12:11.920 --> 12:15.200
 neo for newborn and then teny for holding.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.320
 So if you look at humans,

12:17.320 --> 12:20.400
 I mean, the little birds that were eggs two weeks ago,

12:20.400 --> 12:22.680
 and now one of them has already flown off.

12:22.680 --> 12:24.520
 The other one's ready to fly off.

12:24.520 --> 12:27.280
 In two weeks, they're ready to just fend for themselves.

12:27.280 --> 12:32.280
 Humans, 16 years, 18 years, 24, getting out of college.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.440
 I'm still learning.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.000
 So that's so fascinating,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.720
 this picture of a vertical and the horizontal.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.080
 When you talk about the horizontal,

12:40.080 --> 12:41.960
 is it in the realm of ideas?

12:41.960 --> 12:42.800
 Exactly.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.320
 Okay, so it's the actual social interactions.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.200
 That's exactly right.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.080
 That's exactly right.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.200
 So basically the concept of neoteny

12:49.200 --> 12:52.760
 is that you spend acquiring characteristics

12:52.760 --> 12:54.160
 from your environment

12:54.160 --> 12:56.960
 in an extremely malleable state of your brain

12:56.960 --> 13:00.640
 and the wiring of your brain for a long period of your life.

13:00.640 --> 13:03.480
 Compared to primates, we are useless.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.320
 You take any primate at seven weeks

13:05.320 --> 13:08.440
 and any human at seven weeks, we lose the battle.

13:08.440 --> 13:11.640
 But at 18 years, you know, all bets are off.

13:11.640 --> 13:14.840
 Like we basically, our brain continues to develop

13:14.840 --> 13:17.760
 in an extremely malleable form till very late.

13:17.760 --> 13:20.360
 And this is what allows education.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.480
 This is what allows the person from Egypt

13:22.480 --> 13:24.680
 to do extremely well now.

13:24.680 --> 13:29.680
 And the reason for that is that the wiring of our brain

13:31.400 --> 13:34.960
 and the development of that wiring is actually delayed.

13:34.960 --> 13:37.480
 So, you know, the longer you delay that,

13:37.480 --> 13:40.840
 the more opportunity you have to pass on knowledge,

13:40.840 --> 13:44.240
 to pass on concepts, ideals, ideas

13:44.240 --> 13:46.080
 from the parents to the child.

13:46.080 --> 13:49.080
 And what's really absolutely beautiful about humans today

13:49.080 --> 13:52.080
 is that that lateral transfer of ideas and culture

13:52.080 --> 13:55.680
 is not just from uncles and aunts and teachers at school,

13:55.680 --> 14:00.280
 but it's from Wikipedia and review articles on the web

14:00.280 --> 14:02.600
 and thousands of journals

14:02.600 --> 14:05.480
 that are sort of putting out information for free

14:05.480 --> 14:08.840
 and podcasts and videocasts and all of that stuff

14:08.840 --> 14:12.840
 where you can basically learn about any topic,

14:12.840 --> 14:16.360
 pretty much everything that would be in any

14:16.360 --> 14:19.520
 super advanced textbook in a matter of days,

14:19.520 --> 14:22.920
 instead of having to go to the library of Alexandria

14:22.920 --> 14:24.720
 and sail there to read three books

14:24.720 --> 14:27.000
 and then sail for another few days to get to Athens

14:27.000 --> 14:28.640
 and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

14:28.640 --> 14:31.360
 So the democratization of knowledge

14:31.360 --> 14:34.280
 and the spread, the speed of spread of knowledge

14:34.280 --> 14:38.920
 is what defines, I think, the human inheritance pattern.

14:38.920 --> 14:43.200
 So you sound excited about it, are you also a little bit

14:43.200 --> 14:46.440
 afraid or are you more excited by the power

14:46.440 --> 14:49.880
 of this kind of distributed spread of information?

14:49.880 --> 14:52.040
 So you put it very kindly that most people

14:52.040 --> 14:55.280
 are kind of using the internet and looking Wikipedia,

14:55.280 --> 14:58.120
 reading articles, reading papers and so on,

14:58.120 --> 15:02.000
 but if we're honest, most people online,

15:02.000 --> 15:03.200
 especially when they're younger,

15:03.200 --> 15:05.840
 probably looking at five second clips on TikTok

15:05.840 --> 15:08.520
 or whatever the new social network is,

15:08.520 --> 15:12.520
 are you, given this power of horizontal inheritance,

15:12.520 --> 15:16.520
 are you optimistic or a little bit pessimistic

15:16.520 --> 15:21.520
 about this new effect of the internet

15:22.520 --> 15:25.560
 and democratization of knowledge on our,

15:26.960 --> 15:29.400
 what would you call this, this genome,

15:29.400 --> 15:31.880
 would you use the term genome, by the way, for this?

15:31.880 --> 15:36.200
 Yeah, I think we use the genome to talk about DNA,

15:36.200 --> 15:38.960
 but very often we say, I'm Greek,

15:38.960 --> 15:40.760
 so people ask me, hey, what's in the Greek genome?

15:40.760 --> 15:42.800
 And I'm like, well, yeah, what's in the Greek genome

15:42.800 --> 15:44.760
 is both our genes and also our ideas

15:44.760 --> 15:46.640
 and our ideals and our culture.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.240
 So the poetic meaning of the word.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.080
 Exactly, exactly, yeah.

15:50.080 --> 15:55.080
 So I think that there's a beauty

15:55.960 --> 15:57.720
 to the democratization of knowledge,

15:57.720 --> 16:00.200
 the fact that you can reach as many people

16:00.200 --> 16:02.800
 as any other person on the planet

16:02.800 --> 16:04.280
 and it's not who you are,

16:04.280 --> 16:06.640
 it's really your ideas that matter,

16:06.640 --> 16:09.080
 is a beautiful aspect of the internet.

16:11.880 --> 16:15.560
 I think there's, of course, a danger of my ignorance

16:15.560 --> 16:18.240
 is as important as your expertise.

16:18.240 --> 16:21.360
 The fact that with this democratization

16:21.360 --> 16:25.120
 comes the abolishment of respecting expertise.

16:25.120 --> 16:28.880
 Just because you've spent 10,000 hours of your life

16:28.880 --> 16:33.320
 studying, I don't know, human brain circuitry,

16:33.320 --> 16:34.160
 why should I trust you?

16:34.160 --> 16:35.640
 I'm just gonna make up my own theories

16:35.640 --> 16:37.240
 and they'll be just as good as yours,

16:37.240 --> 16:39.640
 is an attitude that sort of counteracts

16:39.640 --> 16:42.480
 the beauty of the democratization.

16:42.480 --> 16:47.400
 And I think that within our educational system

16:47.400 --> 16:49.720
 and within the upbringing of our children,

16:49.720 --> 16:52.320
 we have to not only teach them knowledge,

16:52.320 --> 16:55.760
 but we have to teach them the means to get to knowledge.

16:55.760 --> 16:59.320
 And that, it's very similar to sort of you fish,

16:59.320 --> 17:01.400
 you catch a fish for a man for one day,

17:01.400 --> 17:03.880
 you fed them for one day, you teach them how to fish,

17:03.880 --> 17:05.560
 you fed them for the rest of their life.

17:05.560 --> 17:07.640
 So instead of just gathering the knowledge

17:07.640 --> 17:09.480
 they need for any one task,

17:09.480 --> 17:11.120
 we can just tell them, all right,

17:11.120 --> 17:12.520
 here's how you Google it,

17:12.520 --> 17:14.640
 here's how you figure out what's real and what's not,

17:14.640 --> 17:16.440
 here's how you check the sources,

17:16.440 --> 17:19.200
 here's how you form a basic opinion for yourself.

17:19.200 --> 17:22.880
 And I think that inquisitive nature

17:22.880 --> 17:26.760
 is paramount to being able to sort through

17:26.760 --> 17:29.320
 this huge wealth of knowledge.

17:29.320 --> 17:32.560
 So you need a basic educational foundation

17:32.560 --> 17:35.520
 based on which you can then add on

17:35.520 --> 17:38.200
 the sort of domain specific knowledge,

17:38.200 --> 17:39.720
 but that basic educational foundation

17:39.720 --> 17:42.400
 should just not just be knowledge,

17:42.400 --> 17:45.240
 but it should also be epistemology,

17:45.240 --> 17:47.240
 the way to acquire knowledge.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.720
 I'm not sure any of us know how to do that

17:49.720 --> 17:51.680
 in this modern day, we're actually learning.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.600
 One of the big surprising thing to me

17:53.600 --> 17:57.280
 about the coronavirus, for example,

17:57.280 --> 17:59.680
 is that Twitter has been

17:59.680 --> 18:02.800
 one of the best sources of information.

18:02.800 --> 18:05.860
 Basically like building your own network of experts,

18:07.960 --> 18:11.040
 as opposed to the traditional centralized expertise

18:11.040 --> 18:13.680
 of the WHO and the CDC,

18:13.680 --> 18:18.680
 or maybe any one particular respectable person

18:19.280 --> 18:21.760
 at the top of a department in some kind of institution,

18:21.760 --> 18:26.520
 you instead look at 10, 20, hundreds of people,

18:26.520 --> 18:31.520
 some of whom are young kids that are incredibly good

18:32.600 --> 18:35.800
 at aggregating data and plotting and visualizing that data.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.240
 That's been really surprising to me.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.840
 I don't know what to make of it.

18:39.880 --> 18:44.300
 I don't know how that matures into something stable.

18:45.480 --> 18:47.000
 I don't know if you have ideas.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.960
 If you were to just try to explain to your kids

18:49.960 --> 18:54.960
 of where should you go to learn about coronavirus,

18:54.960 --> 18:56.800
 what would you say?

18:56.800 --> 18:58.080
 It's such a beautiful example.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.920
 And I think the current pandemic

18:59.920 --> 19:03.960
 and the speed at which the scientific community has moved

19:03.960 --> 19:04.780
 in the current pandemic,

19:04.780 --> 19:08.060
 I think exemplifies this horizontal transfer

19:08.060 --> 19:10.820
 and the speed of horizontal transfer of information.

19:10.820 --> 19:15.320
 The fact that the genome was first sequenced

19:15.320 --> 19:16.380
 in early January,

19:16.380 --> 19:20.360
 the first sample was obtained December 29, 2019,

19:20.360 --> 19:23.560
 a week after the publication of the first genome sequence,

19:23.560 --> 19:26.700
 Moderna had already finalized its vaccine design

19:27.800 --> 19:29.500
 and was moving to production.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.820
 I mean, this is phenomenal.

19:31.820 --> 19:34.980
 The fact that we go from not knowing

19:34.980 --> 19:36.740
 what the heck is killing people in Wuhan

19:36.740 --> 19:41.740
 to wow, it's SARS CoV2 and here's the set of genes,

19:41.900 --> 19:43.580
 here's the genome, here's the sequence,

19:43.580 --> 19:45.660
 here are the polymorphisms, et cetera,

19:45.660 --> 19:48.220
 in the matter of weeks is phenomenal.

19:48.220 --> 19:52.760
 In that incredible pace of transfer of knowledge,

19:52.760 --> 19:54.380
 there have been many mistakes.

19:54.380 --> 19:56.620
 So, some of those mistakes

19:56.620 --> 19:57.940
 may have been politically motivated

19:57.940 --> 20:00.860
 or other mistakes may have just been innocuous errors.

20:00.860 --> 20:02.820
 Others may have been misleading the public

20:02.820 --> 20:05.540
 for the greater good, such as don't wear masks

20:05.540 --> 20:07.220
 because we don't want the mask to run out.

20:07.220 --> 20:09.060
 I mean, that was very silly in my view

20:09.060 --> 20:10.440
 and a very big mistake.

20:11.360 --> 20:15.060
 But the spread of knowledge

20:15.060 --> 20:17.300
 from the scientific community was phenomenal.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.680
 And some people will point out to bogus articles

20:20.680 --> 20:22.860
 that snuck in and made the front page.

20:22.860 --> 20:23.700
 Yeah, they did.

20:23.700 --> 20:26.100
 But within 24 hours, they were debunked

20:26.100 --> 20:27.500
 and went out of the front page.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.160
 And I think that's the beauty of science today.

20:30.160 --> 20:33.220
 The fact that it's not, oh, knowledge is fixed.

20:33.220 --> 20:36.980
 It's the ability to embrace that nothing is permanent

20:36.980 --> 20:37.860
 when it comes to knowledge,

20:37.860 --> 20:40.020
 that everything is the current best hypothesis

20:40.020 --> 20:42.900
 and the current best model that best fits the current data

20:42.900 --> 20:45.780
 and the willingness to be wrong.

20:45.780 --> 20:48.260
 The expectation that we're gonna be wrong

20:48.260 --> 20:50.660
 and the celebration of success based on

20:50.660 --> 20:52.700
 how long was I not proven wrong for,

20:52.700 --> 20:55.620
 rather than, wow, I was exactly right.

20:55.620 --> 20:57.020
 Because no one is gonna be exactly right

20:57.020 --> 20:58.940
 with partial knowledge.

20:58.940 --> 21:03.140
 But the arc towards perfection,

21:03.140 --> 21:05.280
 I think is so much more important

21:05.280 --> 21:08.700
 than how far you are in your first step.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.380
 And I think that's what sort of

21:10.380 --> 21:13.420
 the current pandemic has taught us.

21:13.420 --> 21:14.780
 The fact that, yeah, no, of course,

21:14.780 --> 21:16.140
 we're gonna make mistakes,

21:16.140 --> 21:18.300
 but at least we're gonna learn from those mistakes

21:18.300 --> 21:20.340
 and become better and learn better

21:20.340 --> 21:21.340
 and spread information better.

21:21.340 --> 21:23.320
 So if I were to answer the question of,

21:23.320 --> 21:26.460
 where would you go to learn about coronavirus?

21:27.700 --> 21:29.960
 First textbook, it all starts with a textbook.

21:29.960 --> 21:32.580
 Just open up a chapter on virology

21:32.580 --> 21:34.420
 and how coronaviruses work.

21:34.420 --> 21:36.940
 Then some basic epidemiology

21:36.940 --> 21:39.860
 and sort of how pandemics have worked in the past.

21:39.860 --> 21:41.860
 What are the basic principles surrounding

21:41.860 --> 21:43.480
 these first wave, second wave?

21:43.480 --> 21:45.420
 Why do they even exist?

21:45.420 --> 21:47.240
 Then understanding about growth,

21:47.240 --> 21:50.260
 understanding about the R0 and RT

21:50.260 --> 21:52.420
 at various time points.

21:52.420 --> 21:55.260
 And then understanding the means of spread,

21:55.260 --> 21:57.340
 how it spreads from person to person.

21:57.340 --> 22:00.080
 Then how does it get into your cells?

22:00.080 --> 22:01.580
 From when it gets into the cells,

22:01.580 --> 22:03.260
 what are the paths that it takes?

22:03.260 --> 22:05.180
 What are the cell types that express

22:05.180 --> 22:07.300
 the particular ACE2 receptor?

22:07.300 --> 22:09.940
 How is your immune system interacting with the virus?

22:09.940 --> 22:12.300
 And once your immune system launches a defense,

22:12.300 --> 22:15.520
 how is that helping or actually hurting your health?

22:15.520 --> 22:16.920
 What about the cytokine storm?

22:16.920 --> 22:18.560
 What are most people dying from?

22:18.560 --> 22:20.020
 Why are the comorbidities

22:20.020 --> 22:23.900
 and these risk factors even applying?

22:23.900 --> 22:25.940
 What makes obese people respond more

22:25.940 --> 22:28.580
 or elderly people respond more to the virus

22:28.580 --> 22:30.620
 while kids are completely,

22:32.500 --> 22:36.380
 very often not even aware that they're spreading it?

22:36.380 --> 22:41.180
 So I think there's some basic questions

22:41.180 --> 22:42.740
 that you would start from.

22:42.740 --> 22:44.340
 And then I'm sorry to say,

22:44.340 --> 22:45.700
 but Wikipedia is pretty awesome.

22:45.700 --> 22:47.780
 Yeah, it is. Google is pretty awesome.

22:47.780 --> 22:48.620
 It used to be a time,

22:48.620 --> 22:50.500
 it used to be a time maybe five years ago.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.000
 I forget when,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.260
 but people kind of made fun of Wikipedia

22:54.260 --> 22:57.260
 for being an unreliable source.

22:57.260 --> 22:58.500
 I never quite understood it.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.260
 I thought from the early days, it was pretty reliable

23:01.260 --> 23:03.660
 or better than a lot of the alternatives.

23:03.660 --> 23:04.780
 But at this point,

23:04.780 --> 23:08.340
 it's kind of like a solid accessible survey paper

23:08.340 --> 23:10.620
 on every subject ever.

23:10.620 --> 23:14.620
 There's an ascertainment bias and a writing bias.

23:14.620 --> 23:17.820
 So I think this is related to sort of people saying,

23:17.820 --> 23:19.860
 oh, so many nature papers are wrong.

23:20.720 --> 23:22.540
 And they're like, why would you publish in nature?

23:22.540 --> 23:23.680
 So many nature papers are wrong.

23:23.680 --> 23:26.120
 And my answer is no, no, no.

23:26.120 --> 23:29.440
 So many nature papers are scrutinized.

23:29.440 --> 23:31.980
 And just because more of them are being proven wrong

23:31.980 --> 23:35.380
 than in other articles is actually evidence

23:35.380 --> 23:37.060
 that they're actually better papers overall

23:37.060 --> 23:39.140
 because they're being scrutinized at a rate

23:39.140 --> 23:41.040
 much higher than any other journal.

23:41.040 --> 23:45.560
 So if you basically judge Wikipedia

23:45.560 --> 23:49.820
 by not the initial content,

23:49.820 --> 23:52.420
 but by the number of revisions,

23:52.420 --> 23:53.900
 then of course it's gonna be the best source

23:53.900 --> 23:55.300
 of knowledge eventually.

23:55.300 --> 23:57.120
 It's still very superficial.

23:57.120 --> 23:58.780
 You then have to go into the review papers,

23:58.780 --> 24:00.180
 et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

24:00.180 --> 24:03.380
 But I mean, for most scientific topics,

24:03.380 --> 24:05.060
 it's extremely superficial,

24:05.060 --> 24:07.660
 but it is quite authoritative

24:07.660 --> 24:10.780
 because it is the place that everybody likes to criticize

24:10.780 --> 24:11.660
 as being wrong.

24:11.660 --> 24:13.620
 You say that it's superficial.

24:13.620 --> 24:18.340
 And a lot of topics that I've studied a lot of,

24:18.340 --> 24:22.200
 I find it, I don't know if superficial is the right word.

24:24.380 --> 24:27.700
 Because superficial kind of implies that it's not correct.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.100
 No, no, no.

24:29.100 --> 24:31.660
 I don't mean any implication of it not being correct.

24:31.660 --> 24:32.860
 It's just superficial.

24:32.860 --> 24:35.540
 It's basically only scratching the surface.

24:35.540 --> 24:37.140
 For depth, you don't go to Wikipedia.

24:37.140 --> 24:38.340
 You go to the review articles.

24:38.340 --> 24:41.860
 But it can be profound in the way that articles rarely,

24:41.860 --> 24:43.300
 one of the frustrating things to me

24:43.300 --> 24:46.580
 about certain computer science,

24:46.580 --> 24:48.380
 like in the machine learning world,

24:48.380 --> 24:53.380
 articles, they don't as often take the bigger picture view.

24:54.900 --> 24:57.440
 There's a kind of data set and you show that it works

24:57.440 --> 24:59.660
 and you kind of show that here's an architecture thing

24:59.660 --> 25:02.300
 that creates an improvement and so on and so forth.

25:02.300 --> 25:05.300
 But you don't say, well, what does this mean

25:05.300 --> 25:08.580
 for the nature of intelligence for future data sets

25:08.580 --> 25:10.080
 we haven't even thought about?

25:10.080 --> 25:11.940
 Or if you were trying to implement this,

25:11.940 --> 25:15.940
 like if we took this data set of 100,000 examples

25:15.940 --> 25:19.260
 and scale it to 100 billion examples with this method,

25:19.260 --> 25:21.220
 like look at the bigger picture,

25:21.220 --> 25:25.540
 which is what a Wikipedia article would actually try to do,

25:25.540 --> 25:28.540
 which is like, what does this mean in the context

25:28.540 --> 25:32.380
 of the broad field of computer vision or something like that?

25:32.380 --> 25:35.340
 Yeah, no, I agree with you completely, but it depends

25:35.340 --> 25:36.180
 on the topic.

25:36.180 --> 25:38.420
 I mean, for some topics, there's been a huge amount of work.

25:38.420 --> 25:40.300
 For other topics, it's just a stub.

25:40.300 --> 25:41.580
 So, you know.

25:41.580 --> 25:42.420
 I got it.

25:42.420 --> 25:43.240
 Yeah.

25:43.240 --> 25:46.380
 Well, yeah, actually the, which we'll talk on,

25:46.380 --> 25:48.060
 genomics was not great.

25:48.060 --> 25:50.460
 Yeah, it's very shallow, yeah, yeah.

25:50.460 --> 25:51.860
 It's not wrong, it's just shallow.

25:51.860 --> 25:52.700
 It's shallow.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.700
 Yeah, every time I criticize something,

25:54.700 --> 25:56.320
 I should feel partly responsible.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.740
 Basically, if more people from my community went there

25:58.740 --> 26:01.120
 and edited, it would not be shallow.

26:01.120 --> 26:04.020
 It's just that there's different modes of communication

26:04.020 --> 26:05.280
 in different fields.

26:05.280 --> 26:08.980
 And in some fields, the experts have embraced Wikipedia.

26:08.980 --> 26:11.180
 In other fields, it's relegated.

26:11.180 --> 26:15.860
 And perhaps the reason is that if it was any better

26:15.860 --> 26:18.000
 to start with, people would invest more time.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.980
 But if it's not great to start with,

26:19.980 --> 26:22.860
 then you need a few initial pioneers who will basically

26:22.860 --> 26:26.460
 go in and say, ah, enough, we're just gonna fix that.

26:26.460 --> 26:29.120
 And then I think it'll catch on much more.

26:29.120 --> 26:32.220
 So if it's okay, before we go on to genomics,

26:32.220 --> 26:35.420
 can we linger a little bit longer on the beauty

26:35.420 --> 26:37.140
 of the human genome?

26:37.140 --> 26:38.580
 You've given me a few notes.

26:38.580 --> 26:41.660
 What else do you find beautiful about the human genome?

26:41.660 --> 26:44.860
 So the last aspect of what makes the human genome unique,

26:44.860 --> 26:49.860
 in addition to the, you know, similarity and the differences

26:49.980 --> 26:54.980
 and the individuality is that, so very early on,

26:56.340 --> 26:58.020
 people would basically say, oh, you don't do that

26:58.020 --> 27:01.260
 experiment in human, you have to learn about that in fly,

27:01.260 --> 27:03.140
 or you have to learn about that in yeast first,

27:03.140 --> 27:05.900
 or in mouse first, or in a primate first.

27:05.900 --> 27:09.040
 And the human genome was in fact relegated to sort of,

27:09.040 --> 27:11.020
 oh, the last place that you're gonna go

27:11.020 --> 27:12.640
 to learn something new.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.220
 That has dramatically changed.

27:14.220 --> 27:17.420
 And the reason that changed is human genetics.

27:18.620 --> 27:22.500
 We are the species in the planet

27:22.500 --> 27:24.660
 that's the most studied right now.

27:24.660 --> 27:26.260
 It's embarrassing to say that,

27:26.260 --> 27:28.380
 but this was not the case a few years ago.

27:28.380 --> 27:33.380
 It used to be, you know, first viruses, then bacteria,

27:33.840 --> 27:37.880
 then yeast, then the fruit fly and the worm,

27:37.880 --> 27:42.420
 then the mouse, and eventually human was very far last.

27:42.420 --> 27:44.740
 So it's embarrassing that it took us this long

27:44.740 --> 27:46.580
 to focus on it, or the...

27:46.580 --> 27:49.220
 It's embarrassing that the model organisms

27:49.220 --> 27:52.660
 have been taken over because of the power of human genetics.

27:52.660 --> 27:55.420
 That right now, it's actually simpler to figure out

27:55.420 --> 27:58.820
 the phenotype of something by mining

27:58.820 --> 28:01.380
 this massive amount of human data

28:01.380 --> 28:04.020
 than by going back to any of the other species.

28:04.020 --> 28:05.540
 And the reason for that is that if you look

28:05.540 --> 28:07.360
 at the natural variation that happens

28:07.360 --> 28:09.700
 in a population of seven billion,

28:09.700 --> 28:13.380
 you basically have a mutation in almost every nucleotide.

28:13.380 --> 28:15.680
 So every nucleotide you wanna perturb,

28:15.680 --> 28:18.780
 you can go find a living, breathing human being

28:18.780 --> 28:20.360
 and go test the function of that nucleotide

28:20.360 --> 28:22.620
 by sort of searching the database and finding that person.

28:22.620 --> 28:23.660
 Wait, why is that embarrassing?

28:23.660 --> 28:24.700
 It's a beautiful data set.

28:24.700 --> 28:26.380
 It's a beautiful data set.

28:26.380 --> 28:29.300
 It's embarrassing for the model organism.

28:29.300 --> 28:30.140
 For the flies.

28:30.140 --> 28:30.980
 Yeah, exactly.

28:30.980 --> 28:34.940
 I mean, do you feel on a small tangent,

28:34.940 --> 28:39.940
 is there something of value in the genome of a fly

28:40.060 --> 28:43.740
 and other of these model organisms that you miss

28:43.740 --> 28:47.420
 that we wish we would be looking at deeper?

28:47.420 --> 28:49.900
 So directed perturbation, of course.

28:49.900 --> 28:54.140
 So I think the place where humans are still lagging

28:54.140 --> 28:55.700
 is the fact that in an animal model,

28:55.700 --> 28:56.540
 you can go and say,

28:56.540 --> 28:58.620
 well, let me knock out this gene completely

28:58.620 --> 29:00.580
 and let me knock out these three genes completely.

29:00.580 --> 29:02.780
 And the moment you get into combinatorics,

29:02.780 --> 29:04.180
 it's something you can't do in the human

29:04.180 --> 29:05.980
 because there just simply aren't enough humans

29:05.980 --> 29:07.060
 on the planet.

29:07.060 --> 29:08.820
 And again, let me be honest,

29:08.820 --> 29:11.180
 we haven't sequenced all seven billion people.

29:11.180 --> 29:12.820
 It's not like we have every mutation,

29:12.820 --> 29:15.060
 but we know that there's a carrier out there.

29:15.060 --> 29:17.500
 So if you look at the trend and the speed

29:17.500 --> 29:19.460
 with which human genetics has progressed,

29:19.460 --> 29:23.300
 we can now find thousands of genes involved

29:23.300 --> 29:27.060
 in human cognition, in human psychology,

29:27.060 --> 29:29.100
 in the emotions and the feelings

29:29.100 --> 29:31.780
 that we used to think are uniquely learned.

29:31.780 --> 29:34.380
 It turns out there's a genetic basis to a lot of that.

29:34.380 --> 29:39.380
 So the human genome has continued to elucidate

29:42.540 --> 29:44.860
 through these studies of genetic variation,

29:44.860 --> 29:47.500
 so many different processes that we previously thought

29:47.500 --> 29:52.300
 were something like free will.

29:52.300 --> 29:54.260
 Free will is this beautiful concept

29:54.260 --> 29:56.740
 that humans have had for a long time.

29:58.060 --> 29:59.860
 In the end, it's just a bunch of chemical reactions

29:59.860 --> 30:00.740
 happening in your brain.

30:00.740 --> 30:03.140
 And the particular abundance of receptors

30:03.140 --> 30:06.100
 that you have this day based on what you ate yesterday

30:06.100 --> 30:10.380
 or that you have been wired with based on your parents

30:10.380 --> 30:12.580
 and your upbringing, et cetera,

30:12.580 --> 30:15.700
 determines a lot of that quote unquote free will component

30:15.700 --> 30:20.700
 to sort of narrow and narrow sort of slices.

30:20.700 --> 30:24.140
 So how much on that point, how much freedom

30:24.140 --> 30:29.020
 do you think we have to escape the constraints

30:29.020 --> 30:30.420
 of our genome?

30:30.420 --> 30:31.980
 You're making it sound like more and more

30:31.980 --> 30:35.060
 we're discovering that our genome is actually has the,

30:35.060 --> 30:37.740
 a lot of the story already encoded into it.

30:37.740 --> 30:39.580
 How much freedom do we have?

30:39.580 --> 30:44.580
 I, so let me describe what that freedom would look like.

30:45.140 --> 30:47.620
 That freedom would be my saying,

30:47.620 --> 30:51.540
 ooh, I'm gonna resist the urge to eat that apple

30:51.540 --> 30:53.220
 because I choose not to.

30:54.500 --> 30:57.620
 But there are chemical receptors that made me

30:57.620 --> 31:01.340
 not resist the urge to prove my individuality

31:01.340 --> 31:04.100
 and my free will by resisting the apple.

31:04.100 --> 31:05.580
 So then the next question is,

31:05.580 --> 31:08.220
 well, maybe now I'll resist the urge to resist the apple

31:08.220 --> 31:09.540
 and I'll go for the chocolate instead

31:09.540 --> 31:10.780
 to prove my individuality.

31:10.780 --> 31:14.460
 But then what about those other receptors that, you know?

31:14.460 --> 31:17.780
 That might be all encoded in there.

31:17.780 --> 31:19.460
 So it's kicking the bucket down the road

31:19.460 --> 31:22.020
 and basically saying, well, your choice

31:22.020 --> 31:24.900
 will may have actually been driven by other things

31:24.900 --> 31:26.660
 that you actually are not choosing.

31:27.860 --> 31:30.020
 So that's why it's very hard to answer that question.

31:30.020 --> 31:31.420
 It's hard to know what to do with that.

31:31.420 --> 31:33.340
 I mean, if the genome has,

31:35.820 --> 31:38.500
 if there's not much freedom, it's a...

31:38.500 --> 31:40.500
 It's the butterfly effect.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.900
 It's basically that in the short term,

31:42.900 --> 31:45.700
 you can predict something extremely well

31:45.700 --> 31:48.100
 by knowing the current state of the system.

31:48.100 --> 31:50.700
 But a few steps down, it's very hard to predict

31:50.700 --> 31:52.380
 based on the current knowledge.

31:52.380 --> 31:55.220
 Is that because the system is truly free?

31:55.220 --> 31:56.340
 When I look at weather patterns,

31:56.340 --> 31:57.860
 I can predict the next 10 days.

31:57.860 --> 32:00.260
 Is it because the weather has a lot of freedom

32:00.260 --> 32:03.420
 and after 10 days it chooses to do something else?

32:03.420 --> 32:07.300
 Or is it because in fact the system is fully deterministic

32:07.300 --> 32:10.100
 and there's just a slightly different magnetic field

32:10.100 --> 32:12.420
 of the earth, slightly more energy arriving from the sun,

32:12.420 --> 32:15.140
 a slightly different spin of the gravitational pull

32:15.140 --> 32:18.860
 of Jupiter that is now causing all kinds of tides

32:18.860 --> 32:20.860
 and slight deviation of the moon, et cetera.

32:20.860 --> 32:22.940
 Maybe all of that can be fully modeled.

32:22.940 --> 32:25.740
 Maybe the fact that China is emitting

32:25.740 --> 32:28.180
 a little more carbon today is actually gonna affect

32:28.180 --> 32:31.460
 the weather in Egypt in three weeks.

32:31.460 --> 32:33.860
 And all of that could be fully modeled.

32:33.860 --> 32:36.780
 In the same way, if you take a complete view

32:36.780 --> 32:42.700
 of a human being now, I model everything about you.

32:42.700 --> 32:44.860
 The question is, can I predict your next step?

32:44.860 --> 32:47.740
 Probably, but at how far?

32:47.740 --> 32:51.260
 And if it's a little further, is that because of stochasticity

32:51.260 --> 32:54.580
 and sort of chaos properties of unpredictability

32:54.580 --> 32:56.100
 of beyond a certain level?

32:56.100 --> 32:58.260
 Or was that actually true free will?

32:58.260 --> 33:01.260
 Yeah, so the number of variables might be so,

33:01.260 --> 33:05.260
 you might need to build an entire universe to be able to model.

33:05.260 --> 33:07.740
 To simulate a human, and then maybe that human

33:07.740 --> 33:09.420
 will be fully simulatable.

33:09.420 --> 33:12.220
 But maybe aspects of free will will exist.

33:12.220 --> 33:13.380
 And where's that free will coming from?

33:13.380 --> 33:14.980
 It's still coming from the same neurons

33:14.980 --> 33:17.580
 or maybe from a spirit inhabiting these neurons.

33:17.580 --> 33:19.740
 But again, it's very difficult empirically

33:19.740 --> 33:22.540
 to sort of evaluate where does free will begin

33:22.540 --> 33:26.700
 and sort of chemical reactions and electric signals.

33:26.700 --> 33:31.140
 So on that topic, let me ask the most absurd question

33:31.140 --> 33:33.900
 that most MIT faculty rolled their eyes on.

33:33.900 --> 33:38.260
 But what do you think about the simulation hypothesis

33:38.260 --> 33:40.220
 and the idea that we live in a simulation?

33:40.220 --> 33:41.580
 I think it's complete BS.

33:41.580 --> 33:44.540
 Okay.

33:44.540 --> 33:45.740
 There's no empirical evidence.

33:45.740 --> 33:47.060
 No, it's not. Absolutely not.

33:47.060 --> 33:49.020
 Not in terms of empirical evidence or not,

33:49.020 --> 33:52.380
 but in terms of a thought experiment,

33:52.380 --> 33:54.860
 does it help you think about the universe?

33:54.860 --> 33:57.500
 I mean, so if you look at the genome,

33:57.500 --> 33:59.180
 it's encoding a lot of the information

33:59.180 --> 34:01.500
 that is required to create some of the beautiful

34:01.500 --> 34:04.220
 human complexity that we see around us.

34:04.220 --> 34:05.940
 It's an interesting thought experiment.

34:05.940 --> 34:10.940
 How much parameters do we need to have

34:11.340 --> 34:15.300
 in order to model this full human experience?

34:15.300 --> 34:17.540
 Like if we were to build a video game,

34:17.540 --> 34:19.980
 how hard it would be to build a video game

34:19.980 --> 34:22.660
 that's like convincing enough and fun enough

34:22.660 --> 34:27.660
 and it has consistent laws of physics, all that stuff.

34:28.340 --> 34:31.380
 It's not interesting to use a thought experiment.

34:31.380 --> 34:35.060
 I mean, it's cute, but it's Occam's razor.

34:35.060 --> 34:36.820
 I mean, what's more realistic,

34:36.820 --> 34:38.340
 the fact that you're actually a machine

34:38.340 --> 34:39.740
 or that you're a person?

34:39.740 --> 34:43.340
 What's the fact that all of my experiences exist

34:43.340 --> 34:45.540
 inside the chemical molecules that I have

34:45.540 --> 34:49.540
 or that somebody is actually simulating all that?

34:49.540 --> 34:50.860
 Well, you did refer to humans

34:50.860 --> 34:52.540
 as a digital computer earlier.

34:52.540 --> 34:53.420
 Of course, of course.

34:53.420 --> 34:54.260
 But that does not.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.300
 It's a kind of a machine, right?

34:55.300 --> 34:56.380
 I know, I know.

34:56.380 --> 35:01.380
 But I think the probability of all that is nil

35:01.740 --> 35:03.500
 and let the machines wake me up

35:03.500 --> 35:05.540
 and just terminate me now if it's not.

35:07.540 --> 35:08.860
 I challenge you machines.

35:08.860 --> 35:10.940
 They're gonna wait a little bit

35:10.940 --> 35:12.380
 to see what you're gonna do next.

35:12.380 --> 35:13.220
 It's fun.

35:13.220 --> 35:16.300
 It's fun to watch, especially the clever humans.

35:17.380 --> 35:18.540
 What's the difference to you

35:18.540 --> 35:21.300
 between the way a computer stores information

35:21.300 --> 35:24.020
 and the human genome stores information?

35:24.020 --> 35:27.020
 So you also have roots and your work.

35:27.020 --> 35:30.660
 Would you say when you introduce yourself at a bar.

35:31.980 --> 35:34.020
 It depends who I'm talking to.

35:34.020 --> 35:36.180
 Would you say it's computational biology?

35:36.180 --> 35:41.180
 Do you reveal your expertise in computers?

35:43.300 --> 35:45.340
 It depends who I'm talking to, truly.

35:45.340 --> 35:47.700
 I mean, basically, if I meet someone who's in computers,

35:47.700 --> 35:51.100
 I'll say, oh, I'm a professor in computer science.

35:51.100 --> 35:52.500
 If I meet someone who's in engineering,

35:52.500 --> 35:54.780
 I say computer science and electrical engineering.

35:54.780 --> 35:55.980
 If I meet someone in biology,

35:55.980 --> 35:57.220
 I'll say, hey, I work in genomics.

35:57.220 --> 35:58.300
 If I meet someone in medicine,

35:58.300 --> 36:00.740
 I'm like, hey, I work on genetics.

36:00.740 --> 36:02.220
 So you're a fun person to meet at a bar.

36:02.220 --> 36:03.940
 I got you, but so.

36:03.940 --> 36:07.460
 No, no, but what I'm trying to say is that I don't,

36:07.460 --> 36:09.100
 I mean, there's no single attribute

36:09.100 --> 36:11.140
 that I will define myself as.

36:11.140 --> 36:12.140
 There's a few things I know.

36:12.140 --> 36:13.140
 There's a few things I study.

36:13.140 --> 36:15.100
 There's a few things I have degrees on

36:15.100 --> 36:17.980
 and there's a few things that I grant degrees in.

36:17.980 --> 36:22.900
 And I publish papers across the whole gamut,

36:22.900 --> 36:26.380
 the whole spectrum of computation to biology, et cetera.

36:26.380 --> 36:31.380
 I mean, the complete answer is that I use computer science

36:31.580 --> 36:32.900
 to understand biology.

36:34.180 --> 36:39.180
 So I develop methods in AI and machine learning,

36:39.460 --> 36:41.700
 statistics and algorithms, et cetera.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.060
 But the ultimate goal of my career

36:44.060 --> 36:45.700
 is to really understand biology.

36:45.700 --> 36:47.780
 If these things don't advance our understanding

36:47.780 --> 36:51.980
 of biology, I'm not as fascinated by them.

36:51.980 --> 36:54.940
 Although there are some beautiful computational problems

36:54.940 --> 36:57.940
 by themselves, I've sort of made it my mission

36:57.940 --> 37:01.660
 to apply the power of computer science

37:01.660 --> 37:06.660
 to truly understand the human genome, health, disease,

37:07.500 --> 37:10.100
 and the whole gamut of how our brain works,

37:10.100 --> 37:11.740
 how our body works and all of that,

37:11.740 --> 37:13.980
 which is so fascinating.

37:13.980 --> 37:16.940
 And so the dream, there's not an equivalent

37:16.940 --> 37:20.940
 sort of complimentary dream of understanding

37:20.940 --> 37:23.340
 human biology in order to create an artificial life

37:23.340 --> 37:26.060
 or an artificial brain or artificial intelligence

37:26.060 --> 37:27.660
 that supersedes the intelligence

37:27.660 --> 37:29.660
 and the capabilities of us humans.

37:30.740 --> 37:31.860
 It's an interesting question.

37:31.860 --> 37:33.260
 It's a fascinating question.

37:33.260 --> 37:38.260
 So understanding the human brain is undoubtedly coupled

37:39.740 --> 37:42.180
 to how do we make better AI?

37:42.180 --> 37:46.420
 Because so much of AI has in fact been inspired

37:46.420 --> 37:47.260
 by the brain.

37:47.260 --> 37:49.060
 It may have taken 50 years

37:49.060 --> 37:51.140
 since the early days of neural networks

37:51.140 --> 37:55.420
 till we have all of these amazing progress

37:55.420 --> 38:00.420
 that we've seen with deep belief networks

38:00.820 --> 38:05.820
 and all of these advances in Go, in Chess,

38:06.460 --> 38:10.420
 in image synthesis, in deep fakes, in you name it.

38:10.420 --> 38:15.420
 But the underlying architecture is very much inspired

38:17.020 --> 38:18.060
 by the human brain,

38:18.060 --> 38:20.900
 which actually posits a very, very interesting question.

38:22.580 --> 38:26.340
 Why are neural networks performing so well?

38:27.220 --> 38:28.980
 And they perform amazingly well.

38:28.980 --> 38:31.740
 Is it because they can simulate any possible function?

38:32.580 --> 38:34.420
 And the answer is no, no.

38:34.420 --> 38:37.180
 They simulate a very small number of functions.

38:37.180 --> 38:39.420
 Is it because they can simulate every function

38:39.420 --> 38:40.500
 in the universe?

38:40.500 --> 38:41.540
 And that's where it gets interesting.

38:41.540 --> 38:44.740
 The answer is actually, yeah, a little closer to that.

38:44.740 --> 38:46.580
 And here's where it gets really fun.

38:47.700 --> 38:51.700
 If you look at human brain and human cognition,

38:51.700 --> 38:53.980
 it didn't evolve in a vacuum.

38:53.980 --> 38:57.620
 It evolved in a world with physical constraints,

38:58.780 --> 39:00.700
 like the world that inhabits us.

39:00.700 --> 39:02.300
 It is the world that we inhabit.

39:03.220 --> 39:08.220
 And if you look at our senses, what do they perceive?

39:08.220 --> 39:12.020
 They perceive different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

39:13.220 --> 39:17.260
 The hearing is just different movements in air,

39:17.260 --> 39:18.820
 the touch, et cetera.

39:18.820 --> 39:20.100
 I mean, all of these things,

39:20.100 --> 39:22.700
 we've built intuitions for the physical world

39:22.700 --> 39:23.980
 that we inhabit.

39:23.980 --> 39:27.660
 And our brains and the brains of all animals evolved

39:27.660 --> 39:29.140
 for that world.

39:29.140 --> 39:32.660
 And the AI systems that we have built

39:32.660 --> 39:34.700
 happen to work well with images

39:34.700 --> 39:36.100
 of the type that we encounter

39:36.100 --> 39:38.380
 in the physical world that we inhabit.

39:38.380 --> 39:42.420
 Whereas if you just take noise and you add random signal

39:42.420 --> 39:44.420
 that doesn't match anything in our world,

39:44.420 --> 39:46.940
 neural networks will not do as well.

39:46.940 --> 39:51.940
 And that actually basically has this whole loop around this,

39:52.900 --> 39:57.620
 which is this was designed by studying our own brain,

39:57.620 --> 39:59.580
 which was evolved for our own world.

39:59.580 --> 40:01.940
 And they happen to do well in our own world.

40:01.940 --> 40:04.140
 And they happen to make the same types of mistakes

40:04.140 --> 40:07.020
 that humans make many times.

40:07.020 --> 40:08.740
 And of course you can engineer images

40:08.740 --> 40:12.580
 by adding just the right amount of sort of pixel deviations

40:12.580 --> 40:15.780
 to make a zebra look like a bamboo and stuff like that,

40:15.780 --> 40:17.060
 or like a table.

40:18.380 --> 40:22.700
 But ultimately the undoctored images at least

40:23.580 --> 40:25.940
 are very often mistaken, I don't know,

40:25.940 --> 40:28.860
 between muffins and dogs, for example,

40:28.860 --> 40:31.220
 in the same way that humans make those mistakes.

40:31.220 --> 40:35.820
 So there's no doubt in my view

40:35.820 --> 40:38.580
 that the more we understand about the tricks

40:38.580 --> 40:40.580
 that our human brain has evolved

40:40.580 --> 40:42.900
 to understand the physical world around us,

40:42.900 --> 40:44.740
 the more we will be able to bring

40:44.740 --> 40:48.780
 new computational primitives in our AI systems

40:48.780 --> 40:52.220
 to again better understand not just the world around us,

40:52.220 --> 40:54.460
 but maybe even the world inside us,

40:54.460 --> 40:57.180
 and maybe even the computational problems that arise

40:57.180 --> 41:00.380
 from new types of data that we haven't been exposed to,

41:00.380 --> 41:03.460
 but are yet inhabiting the same universe that we live in

41:03.460 --> 41:06.100
 with a very tiny little subset of functions

41:06.100 --> 41:08.140
 from all possible mathematical functions.

41:08.140 --> 41:10.220
 Yeah, and that small subset of functions,

41:10.220 --> 41:12.940
 all that matters to us humans really, that's what makes.

41:12.940 --> 41:14.860
 It's all that has mattered so far.

41:14.860 --> 41:17.100
 And even within our scientific realm,

41:17.100 --> 41:19.740
 it's all that seems to continue to matter.

41:19.740 --> 41:24.740
 But I mean, I always like to think about our senses

41:24.860 --> 41:29.380
 and how much of the physical world around us we perceive.

41:29.380 --> 41:34.380
 And if you look at the LIGO experiment

41:35.020 --> 41:38.220
 over the last year and a half has been all over the news.

41:38.220 --> 41:39.660
 What did LIGO do?

41:39.660 --> 41:42.940
 It created a new sense for human beings,

41:42.940 --> 41:45.820
 a sense that has never been sensed

41:45.820 --> 41:47.300
 in the history of our planet.

41:48.980 --> 41:51.620
 Gravitational waves have been traversing the earth

41:53.020 --> 41:55.220
 since its creation a few billion years ago.

41:55.220 --> 41:59.580
 Life has evolved senses to sense things

41:59.580 --> 42:01.260
 that were never before sensed.

42:02.220 --> 42:05.780
 Light was not perceived by early life.

42:05.780 --> 42:06.620
 No one cared.

42:07.580 --> 42:11.260
 And eventually photoreceptors evolved

42:11.260 --> 42:14.220
 and the ability to sense colors

42:14.220 --> 42:16.060
 by sort of catching different parts

42:16.060 --> 42:19.140
 of that electromagnetic spectrum.

42:19.140 --> 42:23.380
 And hearing evolved and touch evolved, et cetera.

42:23.380 --> 42:27.700
 But no organism evolved a way to sense neutrinos

42:27.700 --> 42:29.940
 floating through earth or gravitational waves

42:29.940 --> 42:31.260
 flowing through earth, et cetera.

42:31.260 --> 42:33.860
 And I find it so beautiful in the history

42:33.860 --> 42:37.020
 of not just humanity, but life on the planet

42:37.020 --> 42:40.460
 that we are now able to capture additional signals

42:40.460 --> 42:43.620
 from the physical world than we ever knew before.

42:43.620 --> 42:46.340
 And axions, for example, have been all over the news

42:46.340 --> 42:47.460
 in the last few weeks.

42:47.460 --> 42:52.460
 And the concept that we can capture and perceive

42:53.580 --> 42:57.660
 more of that physical world is as exciting

42:57.660 --> 43:01.980
 as the fact that we were blind to it

43:01.980 --> 43:04.620
 is traumatizing before.

43:04.620 --> 43:08.260
 Because that also tells us, you know, we're in 2020.

43:09.380 --> 43:12.820
 Picture yourself in 3020 or in 20, you know.

43:12.820 --> 43:15.580
 What new senses might we discover?

43:15.580 --> 43:19.580
 Is it, you know, could it be that we're missing

43:19.580 --> 43:21.900
 nine tenths of physics?

43:21.900 --> 43:23.980
 That like, there's a lot of physics out there

43:23.980 --> 43:27.900
 that we're just blind to, completely oblivious to it.

43:27.900 --> 43:29.340
 And yet they're permeating us all the time.

43:29.340 --> 43:31.140
 Yeah, so it might be right in front of us.

43:31.140 --> 43:34.220
 So when you're thinking about premonitions,

43:35.060 --> 43:37.580
 yeah, a lot of that is ascertainment bias.

43:37.580 --> 43:39.420
 Like, yeah, you know, every now and then you're like,

43:39.420 --> 43:41.020
 oh, I remember my friend.

43:41.020 --> 43:42.660
 And then my friend doesn't appear

43:42.660 --> 43:44.540
 and I'll forget that I remembered my friend.

43:44.540 --> 43:45.980
 But every now and then my friend will actually appear.

43:45.980 --> 43:48.340
 I'm like, oh my God, I thought about you a minute ago.

43:48.340 --> 43:50.140
 You just called me, that's amazing.

43:50.140 --> 43:51.980
 So, you know, some of that is this,

43:51.980 --> 43:55.060
 but some of that might be that there are,

43:55.060 --> 43:59.900
 within our brain, sensors for waves

43:59.900 --> 44:02.260
 that we emit that we're not even aware of.

44:03.220 --> 44:07.020
 And this whole concept of when I hug my children,

44:07.020 --> 44:10.460
 there's such an emotional transfer there

44:10.460 --> 44:12.220
 that we don't comprehend.

44:12.220 --> 44:15.100
 I mean, sure, yeah, of course we're all like hard wire

44:15.100 --> 44:16.700
 for all kinds of touchy feely things

44:16.700 --> 44:18.220
 between parents and kids, it's beautiful,

44:18.220 --> 44:20.660
 between partners, it's beautiful, et cetera.

44:20.660 --> 44:24.900
 But then there are intangible aspects

44:24.900 --> 44:27.340
 of human communication

44:27.340 --> 44:30.020
 that I don't think it's unfathomable

44:30.020 --> 44:32.060
 that our brain has actually evolved waves and sensors

44:32.060 --> 44:33.940
 for it that we just don't capture.

44:33.940 --> 44:35.220
 We don't understand the function

44:35.220 --> 44:37.420
 of the vast majority of our neurons.

44:37.420 --> 44:40.100
 And maybe our brain is already sensing it,

44:40.100 --> 44:43.940
 but even worse, maybe our brain is not sensing it at all.

44:43.940 --> 44:46.620
 And we're oblivious to this until we build a machine

44:46.620 --> 44:48.300
 that suddenly is able to sort of capture

44:48.300 --> 44:50.340
 so much more of what's happening in the natural world.

44:50.340 --> 44:52.620
 So what you're saying is physics

44:52.620 --> 44:54.780
 is going to discover a sensor for love.

44:57.220 --> 45:00.220
 And maybe dogs are off scale for that.

45:01.460 --> 45:04.140
 And we've been oblivious to it the whole time

45:04.140 --> 45:05.740
 because we didn't have the right sensor.

45:05.740 --> 45:07.420
 And now you're gonna have a little wrist that says,

45:07.420 --> 45:09.660
 oh my God, I feel all this love in the house.

45:09.660 --> 45:11.860
 I sense a disturbance in the forest.

45:11.860 --> 45:13.660
 It's all around us.

45:13.660 --> 45:15.780
 And dogs and cats will have zero.

45:15.780 --> 45:17.020
 None. None.

45:17.020 --> 45:17.860
 It's just.

45:17.860 --> 45:18.700
 Oh, no signal.

45:20.100 --> 45:24.540
 But let's take a step back to our unfortunate place.

45:24.540 --> 45:27.220
 To one of the 400 topics that we had actually planned for.

45:29.580 --> 45:31.820
 But to our sad time in 2020

45:31.820 --> 45:33.860
 when we only have just a few sensors

45:33.860 --> 45:37.620
 and very primitive early computers.

45:37.620 --> 45:41.820
 So you have a foot in computer science

45:41.820 --> 45:43.500
 and a foot in biology.

45:43.500 --> 45:48.300
 In your sense, how do computers represent information

45:48.300 --> 45:52.300
 differently than like the genome or biological systems?

45:52.300 --> 45:55.540
 So first of all, let me correct

45:55.540 --> 45:58.180
 that no, we're in an amazing time in 2020.

46:00.340 --> 46:02.460
 Computer science is totally awesome.

46:02.460 --> 46:03.980
 And physics is totally awesome.

46:03.980 --> 46:06.900
 And we have understood so much of the natural world

46:06.900 --> 46:08.500
 than ever before.

46:08.500 --> 46:13.140
 So I am extremely grateful and feeling extremely lucky

46:13.140 --> 46:16.180
 to be living in the time that we are.

46:16.180 --> 46:17.540
 Cause you know, first of all,

46:17.540 --> 46:20.140
 who knows when the asteroid will hit.

46:20.140 --> 46:25.140
 And second, you know, of all times in humanity,

46:26.140 --> 46:29.380
 this is probably the best time to be a human being.

46:29.380 --> 46:31.100
 And this might actually be the best place

46:31.100 --> 46:31.940
 to be a human being.

46:31.940 --> 46:34.420
 So anyway, you know, for anyone who loves science,

46:34.420 --> 46:35.260
 this is it.

46:35.260 --> 46:36.100
 This is awesome.

46:36.100 --> 46:36.940
 This is a great time.

46:36.940 --> 46:39.300
 At the same time, just a quick comment.

46:39.300 --> 46:43.060
 All I meant is that if we look several hundred years

46:43.060 --> 46:48.060
 from now and we end up somehow not destroying ourselves,

46:48.500 --> 46:50.300
 people will probably look back at this time

46:50.300 --> 46:55.300
 in computer science and at your work of Manos at MIT.

46:55.620 --> 46:56.580
 As infantile.

46:56.580 --> 46:59.620
 As infantile and silly and how ignorant it all was.

46:59.620 --> 47:02.500
 I like to joke very often with my students

47:02.500 --> 47:04.220
 that, you know, we've written so many papers.

47:04.220 --> 47:05.260
 We've published so much.

47:05.260 --> 47:06.460
 We've been citing so much.

47:06.460 --> 47:08.380
 And every single time I tell my students, you know,

47:08.380 --> 47:09.700
 the best is ahead of us.

47:09.700 --> 47:11.380
 What we're working on now

47:11.380 --> 47:13.860
 is the most exciting thing I've ever worked on.

47:13.860 --> 47:16.420
 So in a way, I do have this sense of, yeah,

47:16.420 --> 47:18.540
 even the papers I wrote 10 years ago,

47:18.540 --> 47:20.300
 they were awesome at the time,

47:20.300 --> 47:22.380
 but I'm so much more excited about where we're heading now.

47:22.380 --> 47:24.500
 And I don't mean to minimize any of the stuff

47:24.500 --> 47:25.460
 we've done in the past,

47:25.460 --> 47:29.020
 but you know, there's just this sense of excitement

47:29.020 --> 47:30.980
 about what you're working on now

47:30.980 --> 47:33.380
 that as soon as a paper is submitted,

47:33.380 --> 47:35.540
 it's like, ugh, it's old.

47:35.540 --> 47:37.140
 You know, I can't talk about that anymore.

47:37.140 --> 47:37.980
 I'm not gonna talk about it.

47:37.980 --> 47:38.820
 At the same time, you're not,

47:38.820 --> 47:41.340
 you probably are not going to be able to predict

47:41.340 --> 47:45.500
 what are the most impactful papers and ideas

47:45.500 --> 47:47.860
 when people look back 200 years from now at your work,

47:47.860 --> 47:50.740
 what would be the most exciting papers.

47:50.740 --> 47:54.220
 And it may very well be not the thing that you expected.

47:54.220 --> 47:58.100
 Or the things you got awards for or, you know.

47:58.100 --> 47:59.980
 This might be true in some fields.

47:59.980 --> 48:00.820
 I don't know.

48:00.820 --> 48:02.340
 I feel slightly differently about it in our field.

48:02.340 --> 48:05.660
 I feel that I kind of know what are the important ones.

48:05.660 --> 48:07.300
 And there's a very big difference

48:07.300 --> 48:09.180
 between what the press picks up on

48:09.180 --> 48:11.620
 and what's actually fundamentally important for the field.

48:11.620 --> 48:13.380
 And I think for the fundamentally important ones,

48:13.380 --> 48:15.580
 we kind of have a pretty good idea what they are.

48:15.580 --> 48:18.140
 And it's hard to sometimes get the press excited

48:18.140 --> 48:20.100
 about the fundamental advances,

48:20.100 --> 48:23.700
 but you know, we take what we get

48:23.700 --> 48:24.740
 and celebrate what we get.

48:24.740 --> 48:27.180
 And sometimes, you know, one of our papers,

48:27.180 --> 48:28.500
 which was in a minor journal,

48:28.500 --> 48:30.180
 made the front page of Reddit

48:30.180 --> 48:33.500
 and suddenly had like hundreds of thousands of views.

48:33.500 --> 48:34.980
 Even though it was in a minor journal

48:34.980 --> 48:37.020
 because, you know, somebody pitched it the right way

48:37.020 --> 48:39.380
 that it suddenly caught everybody's attention.

48:39.380 --> 48:42.020
 Whereas other papers that are sort of truly fundamental,

48:42.020 --> 48:43.660
 you know, we have a hard time

48:43.660 --> 48:46.060
 getting the editors even excited about them

48:46.060 --> 48:47.860
 when so many hundreds of people

48:47.860 --> 48:50.860
 are already using the results and building upon them.

48:50.860 --> 48:54.420
 So I do appreciate that there's a discrepancy

48:54.420 --> 48:57.420
 between the perception and the perceived success

48:57.420 --> 48:59.500
 and the awards that you get for various papers.

48:59.500 --> 49:02.500
 But I think that fundamentally, I know that, you know,

49:02.500 --> 49:04.380
 some paper, I'm so, so when you write.

49:04.380 --> 49:06.820
 So is there a paper that you're most proud of?

49:06.820 --> 49:09.340
 See, now you just, you trapped yourself.

49:09.340 --> 49:10.340
 No, no, no, no, I mean.

49:10.340 --> 49:13.540
 Is there a line of work that you have a sense

49:14.620 --> 49:17.580
 is really powerful that you've done to date?

49:17.580 --> 49:20.180
 You've done so much work in so many directions,

49:20.180 --> 49:21.860
 which is interesting.

49:21.860 --> 49:25.340
 Is there something where you think is quite special?

49:25.340 --> 49:28.740
 I mean, it's like asking me to say

49:28.740 --> 49:30.380
 which of my three children I love best.

49:30.380 --> 49:31.220
 I mean.

49:34.060 --> 49:34.900
 Exactly.

49:34.900 --> 49:38.500
 So, I mean, and it's such a gimme question

49:38.500 --> 49:42.580
 that is so, so difficult not to brag

49:42.580 --> 49:44.740
 about the awesome work that my team

49:44.740 --> 49:46.060
 and my students have done.

49:47.060 --> 49:49.940
 And I'll just mention a few off the top of my head.

49:49.940 --> 49:53.060
 I mean, basically there's a few landmark papers

49:53.060 --> 49:56.780
 that I think have shaped my scientific path.

49:56.780 --> 50:00.380
 And, you know, I like to somehow describe it

50:00.380 --> 50:03.620
 as a linear continuation of one thing led to another

50:03.620 --> 50:05.340
 and led to another led to another.

50:05.340 --> 50:09.060
 And, you know, it kind of all started with,

50:11.020 --> 50:12.340
 skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.

50:12.340 --> 50:14.020
 Let me try to start somewhere in the middle.

50:14.020 --> 50:19.020
 So my first PhD paper was the first comparative analysis

50:20.460 --> 50:21.820
 of multiple species.

50:21.820 --> 50:23.580
 So multiple complete genomes.

50:23.580 --> 50:27.340
 So for the first time we basically developed the concept

50:27.340 --> 50:29.980
 of genome wide evolutionary signatures.

50:29.980 --> 50:32.940
 The fact that you could look across the entire genome

50:32.940 --> 50:35.660
 and understand how things evolve.

50:35.660 --> 50:38.260
 And from these signatures of evolution

50:38.260 --> 50:41.540
 you could go back and study any one region

50:41.540 --> 50:44.020
 and say, that's a protein coding gene.

50:44.020 --> 50:45.540
 That's an RNA gene.

50:45.540 --> 50:47.260
 That's a regulatory motif.

50:47.260 --> 50:50.100
 That's a, you know, binding site and so on and so forth.

50:50.100 --> 50:50.940
 So.

50:50.940 --> 50:52.660
 I'm sorry, so comparing different.

50:52.660 --> 50:53.780
 Different species.

50:53.780 --> 50:55.060
 Species of the same.

50:55.060 --> 50:57.140
 So take human, mouse, rat and dog.

50:57.140 --> 50:58.060
 Yeah.

50:58.060 --> 50:59.980
 You know, they're all animals, they're all mammals.

50:59.980 --> 51:02.820
 They're all performing similar functions with their heart,

51:02.820 --> 51:05.860
 with their brain, with their lungs, et cetera, et cetera.

51:05.860 --> 51:08.140
 So there's many functional elements

51:08.140 --> 51:10.900
 that make us uniquely mammalian.

51:10.900 --> 51:14.620
 And those mammalian elements are actually conserved.

51:14.620 --> 51:17.740
 99% of our genome does not code for protein.

51:18.940 --> 51:20.780
 1% codes for protein.

51:20.780 --> 51:25.100
 The other 99%, we frankly didn't know what it does

51:25.100 --> 51:28.140
 until we started doing this comparative genomic studies.

51:28.140 --> 51:32.060
 So basically these series of papers in my career

51:32.060 --> 51:34.540
 have basically first developed that concept

51:34.540 --> 51:37.460
 of evolutionary signatures and then apply them to yeast,

51:37.460 --> 51:40.140
 apply them to flies, apply them to four mammals,

51:40.140 --> 51:41.620
 apply them to 17 fungi,

51:41.620 --> 51:43.700
 apply them to 12 Drosophila species,

51:43.700 --> 51:46.900
 apply them to then 29 mammals and now 200 mammals.

51:46.900 --> 51:48.820
 So sorry, so can we.

51:48.820 --> 51:51.380
 So the evolutionary signatures seems like

51:51.380 --> 51:53.580
 it's such a fascinating idea.

51:53.580 --> 51:57.380
 And we're probably gonna linger on your early PhD work

51:57.380 --> 51:58.220
 for two hours.

51:58.220 --> 52:03.220
 But what is, how can you reveal something interesting

52:04.260 --> 52:08.500
 about the genome by looking at the multiple,

52:08.500 --> 52:11.900
 multiple species and looking at the evolutionary signatures?

52:11.900 --> 52:16.900
 Yeah, so you basically align

52:16.900 --> 52:20.820
 the matching regions.

52:20.820 --> 52:23.980
 So everything evolved from a common ancestor way, way back.

52:23.980 --> 52:26.020
 And mammals evolved from a common ancestor

52:26.020 --> 52:27.860
 about 60 million years back.

52:27.860 --> 52:32.860
 So after the meteor that killed off the dinosaurs landed

52:35.460 --> 52:38.780
 near Machu Picchu, we know the crater.

52:38.780 --> 52:40.580
 It didn't allegedly land.

52:41.700 --> 52:42.860
 That was the aliens, okay.

52:42.860 --> 52:44.660
 No, just slightly north of Machu Picchu

52:44.660 --> 52:47.100
 in the Gulf of Mexico, there's a giant hole

52:47.100 --> 52:49.060
 that that meteor impact.

52:49.060 --> 52:51.380
 Sorry, is that definitive to people?

52:51.380 --> 52:56.380
 Have people conclusively figured out

52:56.380 --> 52:58.180
 what killed the dinosaurs?

52:58.180 --> 52:59.220
 I think so.

52:59.220 --> 53:00.540
 So it was a meteor?

53:00.540 --> 53:04.860
 Well, volcanic activity, all kinds of other stuff

53:04.860 --> 53:09.580
 is coinciding, but the meteor is pretty unique

53:09.580 --> 53:11.180
 and we now have. That's also terrifying.

53:11.180 --> 53:14.940
 I wouldn't, we still have a lot of 2020 left,

53:14.940 --> 53:15.780
 so if anything.

53:15.780 --> 53:17.220
 No, no, but think about it this way.

53:17.220 --> 53:22.220
 So the dinosaurs ruled the earth for 175 million years.

53:24.420 --> 53:28.380
 We humans have been around for what?

53:28.380 --> 53:29.940
 Less than 1 million years.

53:29.940 --> 53:32.900
 If you're super generous about what you call humans

53:32.900 --> 53:35.340
 and you include chimps basically.

53:35.340 --> 53:38.580
 So we are just getting warmed up

53:38.580 --> 53:42.500
 and we've ruled the planet much more ruthlessly

53:42.500 --> 53:43.860
 than Tyrannosaurus Rex.

53:46.220 --> 53:48.340
 T Rex had much less of an environmental impact

53:48.340 --> 53:49.580
 than we did.

53:49.580 --> 53:54.020
 And if you give us another 174 million years,

53:54.020 --> 53:58.380
 humans will look very different if we make it that far.

53:58.380 --> 54:02.180
 So I think dinosaurs basically are much more

54:02.180 --> 54:06.100
 of life history on earth than we are in all respects.

54:06.100 --> 54:08.740
 But look at the bright side, when they were killed off,

54:08.740 --> 54:10.860
 another life form emerged, mammals.

54:10.860 --> 54:14.620
 And that's that whole evolutionary branching

54:14.620 --> 54:15.460
 that's happened.

54:15.460 --> 54:17.060
 So you kind of have,

54:17.060 --> 54:19.180
 when you have these evolutionary signatures,

54:19.180 --> 54:22.660
 is there basically a map of how the genome changed?

54:22.660 --> 54:23.540
 Yeah, exactly, exactly.

54:23.540 --> 54:26.180
 So now you can go back to this early mammal

54:26.180 --> 54:29.260
 that was hiding in caves and you can basically ask

54:29.260 --> 54:31.300
 what happened after the dinosaurs were wiped out.

54:31.300 --> 54:34.060
 A ton of evolutionary niches opened up

54:34.060 --> 54:37.460
 and the mammals started populating all of these niches.

54:37.460 --> 54:40.660
 And in that diversification,

54:40.660 --> 54:44.740
 there was room for expansion of new types of functions.

54:44.740 --> 54:49.740
 So some of them populated the air with bats flying,

54:50.140 --> 54:51.660
 a new evolution of flight.

54:53.260 --> 54:57.460
 Some populated the oceans with dolphins and whales

54:57.460 --> 54:58.700
 going off to swim, et cetera.

54:58.700 --> 55:01.380
 But we all are fundamentally mammals.

55:01.380 --> 55:04.220
 So you can take the genomes of all these species

55:04.220 --> 55:06.260
 and align them on top of each other

55:06.260 --> 55:11.260
 and basically create nucleotide resolution correspondences.

55:11.860 --> 55:14.220
 What my PhD work showed is that when you do that,

55:14.220 --> 55:17.180
 when you line up species on top of each other,

55:17.180 --> 55:19.860
 you can see that within protein coding genes,

55:19.860 --> 55:21.980
 there's a particular pattern of evolution

55:21.980 --> 55:25.780
 that is dictated by the level at which

55:25.780 --> 55:27.700
 evolutionary selection acts.

55:27.700 --> 55:30.700
 If I'm coding for a protein and I change

55:30.700 --> 55:34.340
 the third codon position of a triplet

55:34.340 --> 55:36.580
 that codes for that amino acid,

55:36.580 --> 55:38.980
 the same amino acid will be encoded.

55:38.980 --> 55:42.020
 So that basically means that any kind of mutation

55:42.020 --> 55:46.140
 that preserves that translation that is invariant

55:46.140 --> 55:49.580
 to that ultimate functional assessment

55:49.580 --> 55:52.420
 that evolution will give is tolerated.

55:52.420 --> 55:55.100
 So for any function that you're trying to achieve,

55:55.100 --> 55:57.820
 there's a set of sequences that encode it.

55:57.820 --> 56:00.380
 You can now look at the mapping,

56:00.380 --> 56:04.460
 the graph isomorphism, if you wish,

56:04.460 --> 56:07.460
 between all of the possible DNA encodings

56:07.460 --> 56:09.780
 of a particular function and that function.

56:09.780 --> 56:12.420
 And instead of having just that exact sequence

56:12.420 --> 56:15.020
 at the protein level, you can think of the set

56:15.020 --> 56:18.020
 of protein sequences that all fulfill the same function.

56:18.020 --> 56:19.420
 What's evolution doing?

56:19.420 --> 56:20.820
 Evolution has two components.

56:20.820 --> 56:25.300
 One component is random, blind, and stupid mutation.

56:25.300 --> 56:30.300
 The other component is super smart, ruthless selection.

56:32.020 --> 56:33.500
 That's my mom calling from Greece.

56:35.220 --> 56:40.060
 Yes, I might be a fully grown man, but I am a Greek.

56:40.060 --> 56:41.540
 Did you just cancel the call?

56:41.540 --> 56:42.380
 Wow, you're in trouble.

56:42.380 --> 56:43.220
 I know, I'm in trouble.

56:43.220 --> 56:44.860
 No, she's gonna be calling the cops.

56:44.860 --> 56:45.700
 Honey, are you okay?

56:45.700 --> 56:47.700
 I'm gonna edit this clip out and send it to her.

56:47.700 --> 56:48.540
 Sure.

56:51.660 --> 56:53.060
 So there's a lot of encoding

56:53.060 --> 56:54.300
 for the same kind of function.

56:54.300 --> 56:56.620
 Yeah, so you now have this mapping

56:56.620 --> 56:58.740
 between all of the set of functions

56:58.740 --> 57:00.900
 that could all encode the same,

57:00.900 --> 57:02.180
 all of the set of sequences

57:02.180 --> 57:04.260
 that can all encode the same function.

57:04.260 --> 57:06.580
 What evolutionary signatures does

57:06.580 --> 57:08.980
 is that it basically looks at the shape

57:08.980 --> 57:11.180
 of that distribution of sequences

57:11.180 --> 57:13.060
 that all encode the same thing.

57:13.060 --> 57:15.220
 And based on that shape, you can basically say,

57:15.220 --> 57:17.940
 ooh, proteins have a very different shape

57:17.940 --> 57:21.340
 than RNA structures, than regulatory motifs, et cetera.

57:21.340 --> 57:24.500
 So just by scanning a sequence, ignoring the sequence

57:24.500 --> 57:26.740
 and just looking at the patterns of change,

57:26.740 --> 57:29.380
 I'm like, wow, this thing is evolving like a protein

57:29.380 --> 57:31.700
 and that thing is evolving like a motif

57:31.700 --> 57:33.180
 and that thing is evolving.

57:33.180 --> 57:35.620
 So that's exactly what we just did for COVID.

57:35.620 --> 57:39.020
 So our paper that we posted in bioRxiv about coronavirus

57:39.020 --> 57:42.020
 basically took this concept of evolutionary signatures

57:42.020 --> 57:45.740
 and applied it on the SARS CoV2 genome

57:45.740 --> 57:48.540
 that is responsible for the COVID 19 pandemic.

57:48.540 --> 57:50.540
 And comparing it to?

57:50.540 --> 57:52.460
 To 44 serbicovirus species.

57:52.460 --> 57:53.700
 So this is the beta.

57:53.700 --> 57:56.220
 What word did you just use, serbicovirus?

57:56.220 --> 58:00.460
 Serbicovirus, so SARS related beta coronavirus.

58:00.460 --> 58:01.460
 It's a portmanteau of a bunch.

58:01.460 --> 58:03.060
 So that whole family of viruses.

58:03.060 --> 58:03.900
 Yeah, so.

58:03.900 --> 58:05.100
 How big is that family by the way?

58:05.100 --> 58:07.420
 We have 44 species that, or I mean.

58:07.420 --> 58:09.340
 There's 44 species in the family?

58:09.340 --> 58:11.100
 Yeah. Virus is a clever bunch.

58:11.100 --> 58:12.900
 No, no, but there's just 44.

58:12.900 --> 58:15.660
 And again, we don't call them species in viruses.

58:15.660 --> 58:16.500
 We call them strains.

58:16.500 --> 58:18.260
 But anyway, there's 44 strains.

58:18.260 --> 58:22.300
 And that's a tiny little subset of maybe another 50 strains

58:22.300 --> 58:24.460
 that are just far too distantly related.

58:24.460 --> 58:29.060
 Most of those only infect bats as the host

58:29.060 --> 58:34.020
 and a subset of only four or five have ever infected humans.

58:34.020 --> 58:35.660
 And we basically took all of those

58:35.660 --> 58:37.740
 and we aligned them in the same exact way

58:37.740 --> 58:39.020
 that we've aligned mammals.

58:39.020 --> 58:42.340
 And then we looked at what proteins are,

58:42.340 --> 58:44.980
 which of the currently hypothesized genes

58:44.980 --> 58:47.420
 for the coronavirus genome

58:47.420 --> 58:50.260
 are in fact evolving like proteins and which ones are not.

58:50.260 --> 58:52.940
 And what we found is that ORF10,

58:52.940 --> 58:54.620
 the last little open reading frame,

58:54.620 --> 58:56.980
 the last little gene in the genome is bogus.

58:56.980 --> 58:58.700
 That's not a protein at all.

58:58.700 --> 58:59.900
 What is it?

58:59.900 --> 59:01.820
 It's an RNA structure.

59:01.820 --> 59:03.540
 That doesn't have a.

59:03.540 --> 59:05.700
 It doesn't get translated into amino acids.

59:05.700 --> 59:08.260
 And that, so it's important to narrow down

59:08.260 --> 59:10.780
 to basically discover what's useful and what's not.

59:10.780 --> 59:11.620
 Exactly.

59:11.620 --> 59:13.580
 Basically, what is even the set of genes?

59:13.580 --> 59:15.500
 The other thing that these evolutionary signatures showed

59:15.500 --> 59:20.500
 is that within ORF3A lies a tiny little additional gene

59:20.660 --> 59:22.700
 encoded within the other gene.

59:22.700 --> 59:24.540
 So you can translate a DNA sequence

59:24.540 --> 59:26.820
 in three different reading frames.

59:26.820 --> 59:30.100
 If you start in the first one, it's ATG, et cetera.

59:30.100 --> 59:32.940
 If you start on the second one, it's TGC, et cetera.

59:32.940 --> 59:36.620
 And there's a gene within a gene.

59:36.620 --> 59:37.860
 So there's a whole other protein

59:37.860 --> 59:41.180
 that we didn't know about that might be super important.

59:41.180 --> 59:45.620
 So we don't even know the building blocks of SARS COVID 2.

59:45.620 --> 59:48.300
 So if we want to understand coronavirus biology

59:48.300 --> 59:50.500
 and eventually find it successfully,

59:50.500 --> 59:51.940
 we need to even have the set of genes

59:51.940 --> 59:53.660
 and these evolutionary signatures

59:53.660 --> 59:55.540
 that I developed in my PhD work.

59:55.540 --> 59:56.380
 Are you really useful here?

59:56.380 --> 59:57.420
 We just recently used.

59:57.420 --> 59:59.500
 You know what, let's run with that tangent

59:59.500 --> 1:00:01.100
 for a little bit, if it's okay.

1:00:01.100 --> 1:00:06.100
 Can we talk about the COVID 19 a little bit more?

1:00:08.700 --> 1:00:13.180
 What's your sense about the genome, the proteins,

1:00:13.180 --> 1:00:16.340
 the functions that we understand about COVID 19?

1:00:16.340 --> 1:00:18.900
 Where do we stand in your sense?

1:00:18.900 --> 1:00:21.420
 What are the big open problems?

1:00:21.420 --> 1:00:25.380
 And also, you kind of said it's important to understand

1:00:25.380 --> 1:00:29.860
 what are the important proteins

1:00:29.860 --> 1:00:32.100
 and why is that important?

1:00:34.140 --> 1:00:39.140
 So what else does the comparison of these species tell us?

1:00:39.420 --> 1:00:43.020
 What it tells us is how fast are things evolving?

1:00:43.020 --> 1:00:46.620
 It tells us about at what level is the acceleration

1:00:46.620 --> 1:00:50.820
 or deceleration pedal set for every one of these proteins.

1:00:50.820 --> 1:00:53.180
 So the genome has 30 some genes.

1:00:54.100 --> 1:00:56.580
 Some genes evolve super, super fast.

1:00:56.580 --> 1:00:59.020
 Others evolve super, super slow.

1:00:59.020 --> 1:01:00.460
 If you look at the polymerase gene

1:01:00.460 --> 1:01:01.980
 that basically replicates the genome,

1:01:01.980 --> 1:01:04.220
 that's a super slow evolving one.

1:01:04.220 --> 1:01:06.340
 If you look at the nucleocapsid protein,

1:01:06.340 --> 1:01:08.380
 that's also super slow evolving.

1:01:09.420 --> 1:01:11.460
 If you look at the spike one protein,

1:01:11.460 --> 1:01:13.380
 this is the part of the spike protein

1:01:13.380 --> 1:01:15.740
 that actually touches the ACE2 receptor

1:01:15.740 --> 1:01:20.740
 and then enables the virus to attach to your cells.

1:01:21.300 --> 1:01:23.820
 That's the thing that gives it that visual...

1:01:23.820 --> 1:01:24.860
 Yeah, the corona look basically.

1:01:24.860 --> 1:01:26.020
 The corona look, yeah.

1:01:26.020 --> 1:01:28.540
 So basically the spike protein sticks out of the virus

1:01:28.540 --> 1:01:31.180
 and there's a first part of the protein S1

1:01:31.180 --> 1:01:34.540
 which basically attaches to the ACE2 receptor.

1:01:34.540 --> 1:01:39.500
 And then S2 is the latch that sort of pushes and channels

1:01:39.500 --> 1:01:41.060
 the fusion of the membranes

1:01:41.060 --> 1:01:46.060
 and then the incorporation of the viral RNA inside our cells

1:01:47.060 --> 1:01:50.460
 which then gets translated into all of these 30 proteins.

1:01:50.460 --> 1:01:55.460
 So the S1 protein is evolving ridiculously fast.

1:01:55.460 --> 1:01:59.460
 So if you look at the stop versus gas pedal,

1:01:59.460 --> 1:02:01.140
 the gas pedal is all the way down.

1:02:02.660 --> 1:02:05.140
 ORF8 is also evolving super fast

1:02:05.140 --> 1:02:06.700
 and ORF6 is evolving super fast.

1:02:06.700 --> 1:02:08.020
 We have no idea what they do.

1:02:08.020 --> 1:02:11.340
 We have some idea but nowhere near what S1 is.

1:02:11.340 --> 1:02:12.180
 So what the...

1:02:12.180 --> 1:02:14.220
 Isn't that terrifying that S1 is evolving?

1:02:14.220 --> 1:02:16.900
 That means that's a really useful function

1:02:16.900 --> 1:02:18.780
 and if it's evolving fast,

1:02:18.780 --> 1:02:20.700
 doesn't that mean new strains could be created

1:02:20.700 --> 1:02:21.540
 or it does something?

1:02:21.540 --> 1:02:24.220
 That means that it's searching for how to match,

1:02:24.220 --> 1:02:26.700
 how to best match the host.

1:02:26.700 --> 1:02:29.260
 So basically anything in general in evolution,

1:02:29.260 --> 1:02:30.100
 if you look at genomes,

1:02:30.100 --> 1:02:32.300
 anything that's contacting the environment

1:02:32.300 --> 1:02:34.980
 is evolving much faster than anything that's internal.

1:02:34.980 --> 1:02:37.140
 And the reason is that the environment changes.

1:02:37.140 --> 1:02:42.140
 So if you look at the evolution of the cervical viruses,

1:02:42.180 --> 1:02:44.420
 the S1 protein has evolved very rapidly

1:02:44.420 --> 1:02:47.420
 because it's attaching to different hosts each time.

1:02:47.420 --> 1:02:48.500
 We think of them as bats,

1:02:48.500 --> 1:02:50.540
 but there's thousands of species of bats

1:02:50.540 --> 1:02:52.900
 and to go from one species of bat to another species of bat,

1:02:52.900 --> 1:02:55.940
 you have to adjust S1 to the new ACE2 receptor

1:02:55.940 --> 1:02:58.100
 that you're gonna be facing in that new species.

1:02:58.100 --> 1:02:59.740
 Sorry, quick tangent.

1:02:59.740 --> 1:03:03.540
 Is it fascinating to you that viruses are doing this?

1:03:03.540 --> 1:03:06.900
 I mean, it feels like they're this intelligent organism.

1:03:06.900 --> 1:03:11.900
 I mean, does it give you pause how incredible it is

1:03:12.380 --> 1:03:16.500
 that the evolutionary dynamics that you're describing

1:03:16.500 --> 1:03:19.260
 is actually happening and they're freaking out,

1:03:19.260 --> 1:03:22.180
 figuring out how to jump from bats to humans

1:03:22.180 --> 1:03:24.220
 all in this distributed fashion?

1:03:24.220 --> 1:03:25.620
 And then most of us don't even say

1:03:25.620 --> 1:03:27.660
 they're alive or intelligent or whatever.

1:03:27.660 --> 1:03:31.340
 So intelligence is in the eye of the beholder.

1:03:31.340 --> 1:03:34.940
 Stupid is as stupid does, as Forrest Gump would say,

1:03:34.940 --> 1:03:36.580
 and intelligent is as intelligent does.

1:03:36.580 --> 1:03:39.220
 So basically if the virus is finding solutions

1:03:39.220 --> 1:03:40.900
 that we think of as intelligent,

1:03:40.900 --> 1:03:42.260
 yeah, it's probably intelligent,

1:03:42.260 --> 1:03:43.940
 but that's again in the eye of the beholder.

1:03:43.940 --> 1:03:45.700
 Do you think viruses are intelligent?

1:03:45.700 --> 1:03:47.300
 Oh, of course not.

1:03:47.300 --> 1:03:48.140
 Really?

1:03:48.140 --> 1:03:49.060
 No.

1:03:49.060 --> 1:03:50.180
 It's so incredible.

1:03:50.180 --> 1:03:52.740
 So remember when I was talking about the two components

1:03:52.740 --> 1:03:55.900
 of evolution, one is the stupid mutation,

1:03:55.900 --> 1:03:57.100
 which is completely blind,

1:03:57.100 --> 1:04:00.260
 and the other one is the super smart selection,

1:04:00.260 --> 1:04:01.820
 which is ruthless.

1:04:01.820 --> 1:04:04.780
 So it's not viruses who are smart.

1:04:04.780 --> 1:04:06.860
 It's this component of evolution that's smart.

1:04:06.860 --> 1:04:10.380
 So it's evolution that sort of appears smart.

1:04:10.380 --> 1:04:12.020
 And how is that happening?

1:04:12.020 --> 1:04:17.020
 By huge parallel search across thousands of parallel

1:04:17.020 --> 1:04:21.700
 of parallel infections throughout the world right now.

1:04:21.700 --> 1:04:23.980
 Yes, but so to push back on that,

1:04:23.980 --> 1:04:27.980
 so yes, so then the intelligence is in the mechanism,

1:04:27.980 --> 1:04:31.380
 but then by that argument,

1:04:31.380 --> 1:04:32.860
 viruses would be more intelligent

1:04:32.860 --> 1:04:34.700
 because there's just more of them.

1:04:34.700 --> 1:04:38.740
 So the search, they're basically the brute force search

1:04:38.740 --> 1:04:40.340
 that's happening with viruses

1:04:40.340 --> 1:04:43.220
 because there's so many more of them than humans,

1:04:43.220 --> 1:04:47.540
 then they're taken as a whole are more intelligent.

1:04:47.540 --> 1:04:51.260
 I mean, so you don't think it's possible that,

1:04:51.260 --> 1:04:55.580
 I mean, who runs, would we even be here if viruses weren't,

1:04:55.580 --> 1:04:58.380
 I mean, who runs this thing?

1:04:58.380 --> 1:04:59.700
 So humans or viruses?

1:04:59.700 --> 1:05:03.060
 So let me answer, yeah, let me answer your question.

1:05:03.060 --> 1:05:08.060
 So we would not be here if it wasn't for viruses.

1:05:10.460 --> 1:05:11.820
 And part of the reason is that

1:05:11.820 --> 1:05:14.340
 if you look at mammalian evolution early on

1:05:14.340 --> 1:05:16.100
 in this mammalian radiation

1:05:16.100 --> 1:05:18.580
 that basically happened after the death of the dinosaurs

1:05:18.580 --> 1:05:22.740
 is that some of the viruses that we had in our genome

1:05:22.740 --> 1:05:24.580
 spread throughout our genome

1:05:24.580 --> 1:05:27.260
 and created binding sites

1:05:27.260 --> 1:05:30.340
 for new classes of regulatory proteins.

1:05:30.340 --> 1:05:33.340
 And these binding sites that landed all over our genome

1:05:33.340 --> 1:05:36.860
 are now control elements that basically control our genes

1:05:36.860 --> 1:05:40.420
 and sort of help the complexity of the circuitry

1:05:40.420 --> 1:05:42.220
 of mammalian genomes.

1:05:42.220 --> 1:05:45.100
 So, you know, everything's coevolution.

1:05:45.100 --> 1:05:47.780
 That's fascinating, we're working together.

1:05:47.780 --> 1:05:48.620
 And yet you say they're dumb.

1:05:48.620 --> 1:05:49.620
 We've coopted them.

1:05:49.620 --> 1:05:51.660
 No, I never said they're dumb.

1:05:51.660 --> 1:05:53.620
 They just don't care.

1:05:53.620 --> 1:05:54.980
 They don't care.

1:05:54.980 --> 1:05:56.980
 Another thing, oh, is the virus trying to kill us?

1:05:56.980 --> 1:05:58.020
 No, it's not.

1:05:58.020 --> 1:05:59.980
 The virus is not trying to kill you.

1:05:59.980 --> 1:06:02.820
 It's actually actively trying to not kill you.

1:06:02.820 --> 1:06:04.940
 So when you get infected, if you die,

1:06:05.980 --> 1:06:07.340
 bomber, I killed him,

1:06:07.340 --> 1:06:09.140
 is what the reaction of the virus will be.

1:06:09.140 --> 1:06:10.940
 Why? Because that virus won't spread.

1:06:12.060 --> 1:06:13.780
 Many people have a misconception of,

1:06:13.780 --> 1:06:16.780
 oh, viruses are smart or oh, viruses are mean.

1:06:16.780 --> 1:06:17.620
 They don't care.

1:06:18.620 --> 1:06:20.780
 It's like, you have to clean yourself

1:06:20.780 --> 1:06:23.300
 of any kind of anthropomorphism out there.

1:06:23.300 --> 1:06:24.140
 I don't know.

1:06:24.140 --> 1:06:24.980
 Oh, yes.

1:06:24.980 --> 1:06:29.580
 So there's a sense when taken as a whole that there's...

1:06:31.780 --> 1:06:32.980
 It's in the eye of the beholder.

1:06:32.980 --> 1:06:34.180
 Stupid is as stupid does.

1:06:34.180 --> 1:06:35.940
 Intelligent is as intelligent does.

1:06:35.940 --> 1:06:38.460
 So if you want to call them intelligent, that's fine.

1:06:38.460 --> 1:06:40.420
 Because the end result is that

1:06:40.420 --> 1:06:42.700
 they're finding amazing solutions.

1:06:42.700 --> 1:06:44.300
 I mean, I am in awe.

1:06:44.300 --> 1:06:45.580
 They're so dumb about it.

1:06:45.580 --> 1:06:46.420
 They're just doing dumb.

1:06:46.420 --> 1:06:47.260
 They don't care.

1:06:47.260 --> 1:06:48.580
 They're not dumb and they're just don't care.

1:06:48.580 --> 1:06:50.060
 They don't care.

1:06:50.060 --> 1:06:51.780
 The care word is really interesting.

1:06:51.780 --> 1:06:54.380
 I mean, there could be an argument that they're conscious.

1:06:54.380 --> 1:06:55.460
 They're just dividing.

1:06:55.460 --> 1:06:56.300
 They're not.

1:06:56.300 --> 1:06:57.620
 They're just dividing.

1:06:57.620 --> 1:06:59.180
 They're just a little entity

1:07:00.020 --> 1:07:02.660
 which happens to be dividing and spreading.

1:07:02.660 --> 1:07:04.420
 It just doesn't want to kill us.

1:07:04.420 --> 1:07:06.340
 In fact, it prefers not to kill us.

1:07:06.340 --> 1:07:07.580
 It just wants to spread.

1:07:07.580 --> 1:07:11.020
 And when I say wants, again, I'm anthropomorphizing,

1:07:11.020 --> 1:07:15.060
 but it's just that if you have two versions of a virus,

1:07:15.060 --> 1:07:17.420
 one acquires a mutation that spreads more,

1:07:17.420 --> 1:07:18.620
 that's going to spread more.

1:07:18.620 --> 1:07:20.260
 One acquires a mutation that spreads less,

1:07:20.260 --> 1:07:21.740
 that's going to be lost.

1:07:21.740 --> 1:07:24.020
 One acquires a mutation that enters faster,

1:07:24.020 --> 1:07:25.100
 that's going to be kept.

1:07:25.100 --> 1:07:27.020
 One acquires a mutation that kills you right away,

1:07:27.020 --> 1:07:28.420
 it's going to be lost.

1:07:28.420 --> 1:07:30.500
 So over evolutionary time,

1:07:30.500 --> 1:07:32.700
 the viruses that spread super well

1:07:32.700 --> 1:07:33.940
 but don't kill the host

1:07:33.940 --> 1:07:36.260
 are the ones that are going to survive.

1:07:36.260 --> 1:07:39.060
 Yeah, but so you brilliantly described

1:07:39.060 --> 1:07:41.060
 the basic mechanisms of how it all happens,

1:07:41.060 --> 1:07:46.060
 but when you zoom out and you see the entirety of viruses,

1:07:46.500 --> 1:07:49.980
 maybe across different strains of viruses,

1:07:49.980 --> 1:07:52.380
 it seems like a living organism.

1:07:52.380 --> 1:07:55.020
 I am in awe of biology.

1:07:55.020 --> 1:07:58.340
 I find biology amazingly beautiful.

1:07:58.340 --> 1:08:01.100
 I find the design of the current coronavirus,

1:08:01.100 --> 1:08:04.260
 however lethal it is, amazingly beautiful.

1:08:04.260 --> 1:08:06.340
 The way that it is encoded,

1:08:06.340 --> 1:08:08.980
 the way that it tricks your cells

1:08:08.980 --> 1:08:12.340
 into making 30 proteins from a single RNA.

1:08:12.340 --> 1:08:14.340
 Human cells don't do that.

1:08:14.340 --> 1:08:18.180
 Human cells make one protein from each RNA molecule.

1:08:18.180 --> 1:08:20.220
 They don't make two, they make one.

1:08:20.220 --> 1:08:22.340
 We are hardwired to make only one protein

1:08:22.340 --> 1:08:23.780
 from every RNA molecule.

1:08:23.780 --> 1:08:25.700
 And yet this virus goes in,

1:08:25.700 --> 1:08:27.620
 throws in a single messenger RNA.

1:08:28.700 --> 1:08:29.980
 Just like any messenger RNA,

1:08:29.980 --> 1:08:32.140
 we have tens of thousands of messenger RNAs

1:08:32.140 --> 1:08:34.140
 in our cells in any one time.

1:08:34.140 --> 1:08:35.820
 In every one of our cells.

1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:40.620
 It throws in one RNA and that RNA is so,

1:08:40.620 --> 1:08:44.100
 I'm gonna use your word here, not my word, intelligent.

1:08:44.100 --> 1:08:49.100
 That it hijacks the entire machinery of your human cell.

1:08:49.300 --> 1:08:52.500
 It basically has at the beginning,

1:08:52.500 --> 1:08:54.460
 a giant open reading frame.

1:08:54.460 --> 1:08:57.140
 That's a giant protein that gets translated.

1:08:57.140 --> 1:09:01.540
 Two thirds of that RNA make a single giant protein.

1:09:01.540 --> 1:09:03.340
 That single protein is basically

1:09:03.340 --> 1:09:04.540
 what a human cell would make.

1:09:04.540 --> 1:09:06.340
 It's like, oh, here's a start code.

1:09:06.340 --> 1:09:07.700
 I'm gonna start translating here.

1:09:07.700 --> 1:09:08.620
 Human cells are kind of dumb.

1:09:08.620 --> 1:09:09.460
 I'm sorry.

1:09:09.460 --> 1:09:12.420
 Again, this is not the words I would normally use.

1:09:12.420 --> 1:09:13.420
 But the human cell basically says,

1:09:13.420 --> 1:09:15.020
 oh, this is an RNA, must be mine.

1:09:15.020 --> 1:09:15.860
 Let me translate.

1:09:15.860 --> 1:09:17.020
 And it starts translating it.

1:09:17.020 --> 1:09:18.460
 And then you're in trouble.

1:09:18.460 --> 1:09:19.300
 Why?

1:09:19.300 --> 1:09:22.380
 Because that one protein as it's growing,

1:09:22.380 --> 1:09:26.980
 gets cleaved into about 20 different peptides.

1:09:26.980 --> 1:09:30.940
 The first peptide and the second peptide start interacting

1:09:30.940 --> 1:09:32.460
 and the third one and the fourth one.

1:09:32.460 --> 1:09:37.460
 And they shut off the ribosome of the whole cell

1:09:37.820 --> 1:09:42.820
 to not translate human RNAs anymore.

1:09:42.820 --> 1:09:46.580
 So the virus basically hijacks your cells

1:09:46.580 --> 1:09:50.820
 and it cuts, it cleaves every one of your human RNAs

1:09:50.820 --> 1:09:52.100
 to basically say to the ribosome,

1:09:52.100 --> 1:09:53.500
 don't translate this one, junk.

1:09:53.500 --> 1:09:55.140
 Don't look at this one, junk.

1:09:55.140 --> 1:09:58.740
 And it only spares its own RNAs

1:09:58.740 --> 1:10:01.300
 because they have a particular mark that it spares.

1:10:01.300 --> 1:10:04.380
 Then all of the ribosomes that normally make protein

1:10:04.380 --> 1:10:06.860
 in your human cells are now only able

1:10:06.860 --> 1:10:09.220
 to translate viral RNAs.

1:10:09.220 --> 1:10:11.460
 And then more and more and more and more of them.

1:10:11.460 --> 1:10:13.100
 That's the first 20 proteins.

1:10:13.100 --> 1:10:16.300
 In fact, halfway down about protein 11,

1:10:16.300 --> 1:10:17.940
 between 11 and 12,

1:10:17.940 --> 1:10:21.020
 you basically have a translational slippage

1:10:21.020 --> 1:10:23.420
 where the ribosome skips reading frame.

1:10:23.420 --> 1:10:24.980
 And it translates from one reading frame

1:10:24.980 --> 1:10:25.820
 to another reading frame.

1:10:25.820 --> 1:10:27.100
 That means that about half of them

1:10:27.100 --> 1:10:29.260
 are gonna be translated from one to 11.

1:10:29.260 --> 1:10:30.900
 And the other half are gonna be translated

1:10:30.900 --> 1:10:32.700
 from 12 to 16.

1:10:32.700 --> 1:10:34.260
 It's gorgeous.

1:10:34.260 --> 1:10:37.380
 And then you're done.

1:10:37.380 --> 1:10:40.420
 Then that mRNA will never translate the last 10 proteins

1:10:40.420 --> 1:10:42.540
 but spike is the one right after that one.

1:10:42.540 --> 1:10:45.140
 So how does spike even get translated?

1:10:45.140 --> 1:10:50.020
 This positive strand RNA virus has a reverse transcriptase

1:10:50.020 --> 1:10:52.340
 which is an RNA based reverse transcriptase.

1:10:52.340 --> 1:10:54.460
 So from the RNA on the positive strand,

1:10:54.460 --> 1:10:56.940
 it makes an RNA on the negative strand.

1:10:56.940 --> 1:10:59.620
 And in between every single one of these genes,

1:10:59.620 --> 1:11:01.060
 these open reading frames,

1:11:01.060 --> 1:11:05.580
 there's a little signal AACGCA or something like that,

1:11:05.580 --> 1:11:09.940
 that basically loops over to the beginning of the RNA.

1:11:09.940 --> 1:11:11.700
 And basically instead of sort of having

1:11:11.700 --> 1:11:14.500
 a single full negative strand RNA,

1:11:14.500 --> 1:11:16.860
 it basically has a partial negative strand RNA

1:11:16.860 --> 1:11:19.700
 that ends right before the beginning of that gene.

1:11:19.700 --> 1:11:20.860
 And another one that ends right before

1:11:20.860 --> 1:11:21.980
 the beginning of that gene.

1:11:21.980 --> 1:11:25.340
 These negative strand RNAs now make positive strand RNAs

1:11:25.340 --> 1:11:27.460
 that then look to the human whole cell

1:11:27.460 --> 1:11:29.780
 just like any other human mRNA.

1:11:29.780 --> 1:11:31.780
 It's like, ooh, great, I'm gonna translate that one

1:11:31.780 --> 1:11:32.980
 because it doesn't have the cleaving

1:11:32.980 --> 1:11:36.340
 that the virus has now put on all your human genes.

1:11:36.340 --> 1:11:38.300
 And then you've lost the battle.

1:11:38.300 --> 1:11:42.500
 That cell is now only making proteins for the virus

1:11:42.500 --> 1:11:45.500
 that will then create the spike protein,

1:11:45.500 --> 1:11:47.620
 the envelope protein, the membrane protein,

1:11:47.620 --> 1:11:50.380
 the nucleocapsid protein that will package up the RNA

1:11:50.380 --> 1:11:53.820
 and then sort of create new viral envelopes.

1:11:53.820 --> 1:11:57.780
 And these will then be secreted out of that cell

1:11:57.780 --> 1:11:59.260
 in new little packages

1:11:59.260 --> 1:12:00.580
 that will then infect the rest of the cells.

1:12:00.580 --> 1:12:01.980
 Repeat the whole process again.

1:12:01.980 --> 1:12:03.300
 It's beautiful, right?

1:12:03.300 --> 1:12:04.140
 It's mind boggling.

1:12:04.140 --> 1:12:05.620
 It's hard not to anthropomorphize it.

1:12:05.620 --> 1:12:08.100
 I know, but it's so gorgeous.

1:12:08.100 --> 1:12:09.900
 So there is a beauty to it.

1:12:09.900 --> 1:12:10.740
 Of course.

1:12:12.140 --> 1:12:13.980
 Is it terrifying to you?

1:12:13.980 --> 1:12:16.940
 So this is something that has happened throughout history.

1:12:16.940 --> 1:12:19.700
 Humans have been nearly wiped out

1:12:19.700 --> 1:12:21.140
 over and over and over again,

1:12:21.140 --> 1:12:23.260
 and yet never fully wiped out.

1:12:23.260 --> 1:12:25.940
 So yeah, I'm not concerned about the human race.

1:12:25.940 --> 1:12:29.340
 I'm not even concerned about the impact

1:12:29.340 --> 1:12:32.460
 on sort of our survival as a species.

1:12:33.780 --> 1:12:35.620
 This is absolutely something,

1:12:35.620 --> 1:12:38.660
 I mean, human life is so invaluable

1:12:38.660 --> 1:12:40.060
 and every one of us is so invaluable,

1:12:40.060 --> 1:12:42.260
 but if you think of it as sort of,

1:12:42.260 --> 1:12:44.100
 is this the end of our species?

1:12:44.100 --> 1:12:46.420
 By no means, basically.

1:12:46.420 --> 1:12:48.100
 So let me explain.

1:12:48.100 --> 1:12:51.260
 The Black Death killed what, 30% of Europe?

1:12:51.260 --> 1:12:55.260
 That has left a tremendous imprint,

1:12:55.260 --> 1:12:59.260
 a huge hole, a horrendous hole

1:12:59.260 --> 1:13:03.620
 in the genetic makeup of humans.

1:13:03.620 --> 1:13:08.620
 There's been series of wiping out of huge fractions

1:13:08.620 --> 1:13:12.180
 of entire species or just entire species altogether.

1:13:12.180 --> 1:13:17.180
 And that has a consequence on the human immune repertoire.

1:13:17.180 --> 1:13:20.860
 If you look at how Europe was shaped

1:13:20.860 --> 1:13:24.700
 and how Africa was shaped by malaria, for example,

1:13:24.700 --> 1:13:26.940
 all the individuals that carry a mutation

1:13:26.940 --> 1:13:29.220
 that protects you from malaria

1:13:29.220 --> 1:13:31.100
 were able to survive much more.

1:13:31.100 --> 1:13:33.820
 And if you look at the frequency of sickle cell disease

1:13:33.820 --> 1:13:35.580
 and the frequency of malaria,

1:13:35.580 --> 1:13:38.340
 the maps are actually showing the same pattern,

1:13:38.340 --> 1:13:40.420
 the same imprint on Africa.

1:13:40.420 --> 1:13:42.340
 And that basically led people to hypothesize

1:13:42.340 --> 1:13:43.860
 that the reason why sickle cell disease

1:13:43.860 --> 1:13:45.660
 is so much more frequent is because

1:13:45.660 --> 1:13:47.620
 sickle cell disease is so much more frequent

1:13:47.620 --> 1:13:50.060
 in Americans of African descent

1:13:50.060 --> 1:13:53.940
 is because there was selection in Africa against malaria

1:13:55.260 --> 1:13:57.780
 leading to sickle cell, because when the cells sickle,

1:13:57.780 --> 1:14:01.380
 malaria is not able to replicate inside your cells as well.

1:14:01.380 --> 1:14:03.060
 And therefore you protect against that.

1:14:03.060 --> 1:14:05.380
 So if you look at human disease,

1:14:05.380 --> 1:14:07.540
 all of the genetic associations that we do

1:14:07.540 --> 1:14:09.220
 with human disease,

1:14:09.220 --> 1:14:13.620
 you basically see the imprint

1:14:13.620 --> 1:14:16.620
 of these waves of selection killing off

1:14:16.620 --> 1:14:18.300
 gazillions of humans.

1:14:18.300 --> 1:14:23.180
 And there's so many immune processes that are coming up

1:14:23.180 --> 1:14:25.900
 as associated with so many different diseases.

1:14:25.900 --> 1:14:27.500
 The reason for that is similar

1:14:27.500 --> 1:14:28.620
 to what I was describing earlier,

1:14:28.620 --> 1:14:33.620
 where the outward facing proteins evolve much more rapidly

1:14:33.620 --> 1:14:35.860
 because the environment is always changing.

1:14:35.860 --> 1:14:37.620
 But what's really interesting in the human genome

1:14:37.620 --> 1:14:40.340
 is that we have coopted many of these immune genes

1:14:40.340 --> 1:14:42.420
 to carry out nonimmune functions.

1:14:42.420 --> 1:14:43.980
 For example, in our brain,

1:14:43.980 --> 1:14:48.860
 we use immune cells to cleave off neuronal connections

1:14:48.860 --> 1:14:50.140
 that don't get used.

1:14:50.140 --> 1:14:52.820
 This whole use it or lose it, we know the mechanism.

1:14:52.820 --> 1:14:57.820
 It's microglia that cleave off neuronal synaptic connections

1:14:57.820 --> 1:14:59.900
 that are just not utilized.

1:14:59.900 --> 1:15:02.020
 When you utilize them, you mark them in a particular way

1:15:02.020 --> 1:15:04.380
 that basically when the microglia come,

1:15:04.380 --> 1:15:07.820
 tell it, don't kill this one, it's used now.

1:15:07.820 --> 1:15:08.940
 And the microglia will go off

1:15:08.940 --> 1:15:10.340
 and kill the ones you don't use.

1:15:10.340 --> 1:15:12.780
 This is an immune function,

1:15:12.780 --> 1:15:14.980
 which is coopted to do nonimmune things.

1:15:14.980 --> 1:15:16.780
 If you look at our adipocytes,

1:15:16.780 --> 1:15:19.900
 M1 versus M2 macrophages inside our fat

1:15:19.900 --> 1:15:22.620
 will basically determine whether you're obese or not.

1:15:22.620 --> 1:15:24.740
 And these are again, immune cells that are resident

1:15:24.740 --> 1:15:27.060
 and living within these tissues.

1:15:27.060 --> 1:15:30.220
 So many disease associations.

1:15:30.220 --> 1:15:33.660
 That's it, that we coopt these kinds of things

1:15:33.660 --> 1:15:36.660
 for incredibly complicated functions.

1:15:36.660 --> 1:15:39.860
 Exactly, evolution works in so many different ways,

1:15:39.860 --> 1:15:41.980
 which are all beautiful and mysterious.

1:15:41.980 --> 1:15:43.340
 But not intelligent.

1:15:43.340 --> 1:15:45.740
 Not intelligent, it's in the eye of the beholder.

1:15:45.740 --> 1:15:50.740
 But the point that I'm trying to make is that

1:15:51.060 --> 1:15:54.260
 if you look at the imprint that COVID will have,

1:15:54.260 --> 1:15:55.980
 hopefully it will not be big.

1:15:55.980 --> 1:15:57.980
 Hopefully the US will get attacked together

1:15:57.980 --> 1:16:00.420
 and stop the virus from spreading further.

1:16:00.420 --> 1:16:03.500
 But if it doesn't, it's having an imprint

1:16:03.500 --> 1:16:07.340
 on individuals who have particular genetic repertoires.

1:16:07.340 --> 1:16:10.060
 So if you look at now the genetic associations

1:16:10.060 --> 1:16:13.620
 of blood type and immune function cells, et cetera,

1:16:13.620 --> 1:16:15.740
 there's actually association, genetic variation

1:16:15.740 --> 1:16:18.540
 that basically says how much more likely am I or you to die

1:16:18.540 --> 1:16:20.220
 if we contact the virus.

1:16:20.220 --> 1:16:24.540
 And it's through these rounds of shaping the human genome

1:16:24.540 --> 1:16:27.380
 that humans have basically made it so far.

1:16:27.380 --> 1:16:32.380
 And selection is ruthless and it's brutal

1:16:32.620 --> 1:16:34.380
 and it only comes with a lot of killing.

1:16:34.380 --> 1:16:38.140
 But this is the way that viruses and environments

1:16:38.140 --> 1:16:39.540
 have shaped the human genome.

1:16:39.540 --> 1:16:41.420
 Basically, when you go through periods of famine,

1:16:41.420 --> 1:16:43.660
 you select for particular genes.

1:16:43.660 --> 1:16:46.540
 And what's left is not necessarily better,

1:16:46.540 --> 1:16:49.020
 it's just whatever survived.

1:16:49.020 --> 1:16:51.980
 And it might have been the surviving one back then,

1:16:51.980 --> 1:16:53.140
 not because it was better,

1:16:53.140 --> 1:16:54.980
 maybe the ones that ran slower survived.

1:16:54.980 --> 1:16:57.420
 I mean, again, not necessarily better,

1:16:57.420 --> 1:17:00.020
 but the surviving ones are basically the ones

1:17:00.020 --> 1:17:02.420
 that then are shaped for any kind

1:17:02.420 --> 1:17:05.420
 of subsequent evolutionary condition

1:17:05.420 --> 1:17:07.260
 and environmental condition.

1:17:07.260 --> 1:17:09.580
 But if you look at, for example, obesity,

1:17:09.580 --> 1:17:12.420
 obesity was selected for basically the genes

1:17:12.420 --> 1:17:14.420
 that now predisposes to obesity

1:17:14.420 --> 1:17:16.660
 were at 2% frequency in Africa.

1:17:16.660 --> 1:17:19.020
 They rose to 44% frequency in Europe.

1:17:19.020 --> 1:17:20.300
 Wow, that's fascinating.

1:17:20.300 --> 1:17:22.940
 Because you basically went through the ice ages

1:17:22.940 --> 1:17:24.620
 and there was a scarcity of food.

1:17:24.620 --> 1:17:27.140
 So there was a selection to being able to store

1:17:27.140 --> 1:17:29.260
 every single calorie you consume.

1:17:29.260 --> 1:17:31.860
 Eventually, environment changes.

1:17:31.860 --> 1:17:35.140
 So the better allele, which was the fat storing allele,

1:17:35.140 --> 1:17:36.500
 became the worst allele

1:17:36.500 --> 1:17:38.780
 because it's the fat storing allele.

1:17:38.780 --> 1:17:40.940
 It still has the same function.

1:17:40.940 --> 1:17:44.100
 So if you look at my genome, speaking of mom calling,

1:17:44.100 --> 1:17:48.500
 mom gave me a bad copy of that gene, this FTO locus.

1:17:48.500 --> 1:17:49.340
 Basically, makes me.

1:17:49.340 --> 1:17:50.460
 The one that has to do with.

1:17:50.460 --> 1:17:51.300
 Obesity.

1:17:51.300 --> 1:17:52.140
 With obesity.

1:17:52.140 --> 1:17:54.500
 Yeah, I basically now have a bad copy from mom

1:17:54.500 --> 1:17:56.340
 that makes me more likely to be obese.

1:17:56.340 --> 1:17:59.180
 And I also have a bad copy from dad

1:17:59.180 --> 1:18:00.020
 that makes me more likely to be obese.

1:18:00.020 --> 1:18:01.860
 So homozygous.

1:18:01.860 --> 1:18:05.860
 And that's the allele, it's still the minor allele,

1:18:05.860 --> 1:18:09.140
 but it's at 44% frequency in Southeast Asia,

1:18:09.140 --> 1:18:12.740
 42% frequency in Europe, even though it started at 2%.

1:18:12.740 --> 1:18:16.060
 It was an awesome allele to have 100 years ago.

1:18:16.060 --> 1:18:17.900
 Right now, it's pretty terrible allele.

1:18:17.900 --> 1:18:21.980
 So the other concept is that diversity matters.

1:18:21.980 --> 1:18:25.660
 If we had 100 million nuclear physicists

1:18:25.660 --> 1:18:28.420
 living the earth right now, we'd be in trouble.

1:18:28.420 --> 1:18:31.820
 You need diversity, you need artists

1:18:31.820 --> 1:18:33.980
 and you need musicians and you need mathematicians

1:18:33.980 --> 1:18:37.100
 and you need politicians, yes, even those.

1:18:37.100 --> 1:18:37.940
 And you need like.

1:18:37.940 --> 1:18:39.580
 Well, let's not get crazy.

1:18:39.580 --> 1:18:43.100
 But because then if a virus comes along or whatever.

1:18:43.100 --> 1:18:44.900
 Exactly, exactly.

1:18:44.900 --> 1:18:45.980
 So, no, there's two reasons.

1:18:45.980 --> 1:18:48.820
 Number one, you want diversity in the immune repertoire

1:18:48.820 --> 1:18:50.820
 and we have built in diversity.

1:18:50.820 --> 1:18:53.380
 So basically, they are the most diverse.

1:18:53.380 --> 1:18:54.900
 Basically, if you look at our immune system,

1:18:54.900 --> 1:18:57.100
 there's layers and layers of diversity.

1:18:57.100 --> 1:19:01.540
 Like the way that you create your cells generates diversity

1:19:01.540 --> 1:19:04.820
 because of the selection for the VDJ recombination

1:19:04.820 --> 1:19:06.580
 that basically eventually leads

1:19:06.580 --> 1:19:08.140
 to a huge number of repertoires.

1:19:08.140 --> 1:19:10.220
 But that's only one small component of diversity.

1:19:10.220 --> 1:19:11.540
 The blood type is another one.

1:19:11.540 --> 1:19:15.900
 The major histocompatibility complex, the HLA alleles

1:19:15.900 --> 1:19:18.020
 are another source of diversity.

1:19:18.020 --> 1:19:21.660
 So the immune system of humans is by nature,

1:19:21.660 --> 1:19:25.580
 incredibly diverse and that basically leads to resilience.

1:19:25.580 --> 1:19:27.460
 So basically what I'm saying that I don't worry

1:19:27.460 --> 1:19:32.460
 for the human species because we are so diverse immunologically,

1:19:32.460 --> 1:19:34.860
 we are likely to be very resilient

1:19:34.860 --> 1:19:39.020
 against so many different attacks like this current virus.

1:19:39.020 --> 1:19:42.100
 So you're saying natural pandemics may not be something

1:19:42.100 --> 1:19:45.180
 that you're really afraid of because of the diversity

1:19:45.180 --> 1:19:48.380
 in our genetic makeup.

1:19:48.380 --> 1:19:50.380
 What about engineered pandemics?

1:19:50.380 --> 1:19:55.380
 Do you have fears of us messing with the makeup of viruses

1:19:55.740 --> 1:19:58.860
 or well, yeah, let's say with the makeup of viruses

1:19:58.860 --> 1:20:00.820
 to create something that we can't control

1:20:00.820 --> 1:20:02.700
 and would be much more destructive

1:20:02.700 --> 1:20:05.300
 than it would come about naturally?

1:20:05.300 --> 1:20:08.020
 Remember how we were talking about how smart evolution is?

1:20:08.020 --> 1:20:09.300
 Humans are much dumber.

1:20:09.300 --> 1:20:10.140
 So.

1:20:10.140 --> 1:20:11.860
 You mean like human scientists, engineers?

1:20:11.860 --> 1:20:13.180
 Yeah, humans, humans just like.

1:20:13.180 --> 1:20:14.020
 Humans overall?

1:20:14.020 --> 1:20:14.860
 Yeah, humans overall.

1:20:14.860 --> 1:20:15.700
 Okay.

1:20:15.700 --> 1:20:19.660
 But I mean, even the sort of synthetic biologists

1:20:19.660 --> 1:20:24.660
 you know, basically if you were to create,

1:20:25.700 --> 1:20:29.700
 you know, virus like SARS that will kill a lot of people,

1:20:29.700 --> 1:20:31.860
 you would probably start with SARS.

1:20:32.860 --> 1:20:37.460
 So whoever, you know, would like to design such a thing

1:20:37.460 --> 1:20:39.980
 would basically start with a SARS tree

1:20:39.980 --> 1:20:42.460
 or at least some relative of SARS.

1:20:42.460 --> 1:20:45.580
 The source genome for the current virus

1:20:45.580 --> 1:20:47.140
 was something completely different.

1:20:47.140 --> 1:20:49.100
 It was something that has never infected anyone

1:20:49.100 --> 1:20:50.620
 and never infected humans.

1:20:50.620 --> 1:20:52.900
 No one in their right mind would have started there.

1:20:52.900 --> 1:20:55.020
 But when you say sources like the nearest.

1:20:55.020 --> 1:20:56.260
 The nearest relative.

1:20:56.260 --> 1:20:57.100
 Relative.

1:20:57.100 --> 1:20:58.420
 Is in a whole other branch.

1:20:58.420 --> 1:20:59.260
 Interesting.

1:20:59.260 --> 1:21:00.980
 No species of which has ever infected humans

1:21:00.980 --> 1:21:02.580
 in that branch.

1:21:02.580 --> 1:21:05.340
 So, you know, let's put this to rest.

1:21:05.340 --> 1:21:08.580
 This was not designed by someone to kill off the human race.

1:21:08.580 --> 1:21:10.940
 So you don't believe it was engineered?

1:21:12.020 --> 1:21:13.100
 The. Or likely.

1:21:13.100 --> 1:21:16.140
 Yeah, the path to engineering a deadly virus

1:21:16.140 --> 1:21:21.140
 did not come from this strain that was used.

1:21:21.220 --> 1:21:26.220
 Moreover, there's been various claims of,

1:21:26.940 --> 1:21:29.300
 ha ha, this was mixed and matched in lab

1:21:29.300 --> 1:21:32.580
 because the S1 protein has three different components,

1:21:32.580 --> 1:21:34.700
 each of which has a different evolutionary tree.

1:21:34.700 --> 1:21:37.300
 So, you know, a lot of popular press basically said,

1:21:37.300 --> 1:21:39.260
 aha, this came from pangolin

1:21:39.260 --> 1:21:42.060
 and this came from, you know, all kinds of other species.

1:21:42.980 --> 1:21:44.900
 This is what has been happening

1:21:44.900 --> 1:21:46.900
 throughout the coronavirus tree.

1:21:46.900 --> 1:21:49.380
 So basically the S1 protein has been recombining

1:21:49.380 --> 1:21:50.420
 across species all the time.

1:21:50.420 --> 1:21:52.020
 Remember when I was talking about the positive strand,

1:21:52.020 --> 1:21:54.340
 the negative strand, sub genomic RNAs,

1:21:54.340 --> 1:21:55.780
 these can actually recombine.

1:21:55.780 --> 1:21:57.140
 And if you have two different viruses

1:21:57.140 --> 1:21:58.540
 infecting the same cell,

1:21:58.540 --> 1:21:59.780
 they can actually mix and match

1:21:59.780 --> 1:22:01.340
 between the positive strand and the negative strand

1:22:01.340 --> 1:22:04.700
 and basically create a new hybrid virus with recombination

1:22:04.700 --> 1:22:06.700
 that now has the S1 from one

1:22:06.700 --> 1:22:08.780
 and the rest of the genome from another.

1:22:08.780 --> 1:22:10.580
 And this is something that happens a lot in S1,

1:22:10.580 --> 1:22:12.060
 in Orfet, et cetera.

1:22:12.060 --> 1:22:13.940
 And that's something that's true of the whole tree.

1:22:13.940 --> 1:22:15.780
 For the whole family of viruses.

1:22:15.780 --> 1:22:18.020
 So it's not like someone has been messing with this

1:22:18.020 --> 1:22:20.860
 for millions of years and, you know, changing.

1:22:20.860 --> 1:22:21.700
 This happens naturally.

1:22:21.700 --> 1:22:24.420
 That's, again, beautiful that that somehow happens,

1:22:24.420 --> 1:22:25.900
 that they recombine.

1:22:25.900 --> 1:22:27.740
 So two different strands can infect the body

1:22:27.740 --> 1:22:28.620
 and then recombine.

1:22:30.460 --> 1:22:35.100
 So all of this actually magic happens inside hosts.

1:22:35.100 --> 1:22:36.300
 Like all, like.

1:22:36.300 --> 1:22:39.220
 Yeah, that's why classification wise,

1:22:39.220 --> 1:22:40.700
 virus is not thought to be alive

1:22:40.700 --> 1:22:41.940
 because it doesn't self replicate.

1:22:41.940 --> 1:22:43.020
 It's not autonomous.

1:22:43.020 --> 1:22:45.740
 It's something that enters a living cell

1:22:45.740 --> 1:22:48.740
 and then co ops it to basically make it its own.

1:22:48.740 --> 1:22:50.660
 But by itself, people ask me,

1:22:50.660 --> 1:22:51.580
 how do we kill this bastard?

1:22:51.580 --> 1:22:54.180
 I'm like, you stop it from replicating.

1:22:54.180 --> 1:22:57.660
 It's not like a bacterium that will just live

1:22:57.660 --> 1:23:01.060
 in a, you know, puddle or something.

1:23:01.060 --> 1:23:02.460
 It's a virus.

1:23:02.460 --> 1:23:04.420
 Viruses don't live without their host.

1:23:04.420 --> 1:23:07.380
 And they only live with their host for very little time.

1:23:07.380 --> 1:23:09.100
 So if you stop it from replicating,

1:23:09.100 --> 1:23:11.260
 it'll stop from spreading.

1:23:11.260 --> 1:23:13.220
 I mean, it's not like HIV, which can stay dormant

1:23:13.220 --> 1:23:14.060
 for a long time.

1:23:14.060 --> 1:23:15.580
 Basically, coronaviruses just don't do that.

1:23:15.580 --> 1:23:16.780
 They're not integrating genomes.

1:23:16.780 --> 1:23:18.060
 They're RNA genomes.

1:23:18.060 --> 1:23:20.220
 So if it's not expressed, it degrades.

1:23:20.220 --> 1:23:21.180
 RNA degrades.

1:23:21.180 --> 1:23:23.380
 It doesn't just stick around.

1:23:23.380 --> 1:23:27.340
 Well, let me ask also about the immune system you mentioned.

1:23:27.340 --> 1:23:30.420
 A lot of people kind of ask, you know,

1:23:31.500 --> 1:23:34.140
 how can we strengthen the immune system

1:23:34.140 --> 1:23:36.300
 to respond to this particular virus,

1:23:36.300 --> 1:23:37.740
 but the viruses in general.

1:23:37.740 --> 1:23:40.420
 Do you have from a biological perspective,

1:23:40.420 --> 1:23:43.140
 thoughts on what we can do as humans

1:23:43.140 --> 1:23:43.980
 to strengthen our immune system?

1:23:43.980 --> 1:23:46.620
 If you look at the death rates across different countries,

1:23:46.620 --> 1:23:49.700
 people with less vaccination have been dying more.

1:23:49.700 --> 1:23:51.380
 If you look at North Italy,

1:23:51.380 --> 1:23:53.940
 the vaccination rates are abysmal there.

1:23:53.940 --> 1:23:55.860
 And a lot of people have been dying.

1:23:55.860 --> 1:23:58.780
 If you look at Greece, very good vaccination rates.

1:23:58.780 --> 1:24:00.300
 Almost no one has been dying.

1:24:00.300 --> 1:24:03.580
 So yes, there's a policy component.

1:24:03.580 --> 1:24:05.980
 So Italy reacted very slowly.

1:24:05.980 --> 1:24:07.460
 Greece reacted very fast.

1:24:07.460 --> 1:24:09.780
 So yeah, many fewer people died in Greece,

1:24:09.780 --> 1:24:11.740
 but there might actually be a component

1:24:11.740 --> 1:24:14.100
 of genetic immune repertoire.

1:24:14.100 --> 1:24:16.700
 Basically, how did people die off, you know,

1:24:16.700 --> 1:24:19.020
 in the history of the Greek population

1:24:19.020 --> 1:24:20.740
 versus the Italian population.

1:24:20.740 --> 1:24:22.300
 Wow. There's a...

1:24:22.300 --> 1:24:24.580
 That's interesting to think about.

1:24:24.580 --> 1:24:25.980
 And then there's a component

1:24:25.980 --> 1:24:28.940
 of what vaccinations did you have as a kid

1:24:28.940 --> 1:24:32.460
 and what are the off target effects of those vaccinations?

1:24:32.460 --> 1:24:34.900
 So basically a vaccination can have two components.

1:24:34.900 --> 1:24:37.620
 One is training your immune system

1:24:37.620 --> 1:24:39.500
 against that specific insult.

1:24:39.500 --> 1:24:42.140
 The second one is boosting up your immune system

1:24:42.140 --> 1:24:43.620
 for all kinds of other things.

1:24:44.580 --> 1:24:47.100
 If you look at allergies,

1:24:47.100 --> 1:24:50.220
 Northern Europe, super clean environments,

1:24:50.220 --> 1:24:51.420
 tons of allergies.

1:24:51.420 --> 1:24:54.020
 Southern Europe, my kids grew up eating dirt.

1:24:54.980 --> 1:24:55.820
 No allergies.

1:24:57.060 --> 1:25:00.420
 So growing up, I never had even heard of what allergies are.

1:25:00.420 --> 1:25:01.940
 Like, was it really allergies?

1:25:01.940 --> 1:25:03.580
 And the reason is that I was playing in the garden.

1:25:03.580 --> 1:25:05.940
 I was putting all kinds of stuff in my mouth from,

1:25:05.940 --> 1:25:07.380
 you know, all kinds of dirt and stuff,

1:25:07.380 --> 1:25:09.620
 tons of viruses there, tons of bacteria there.

1:25:09.620 --> 1:25:11.500
 You know, my immune system was built up.

1:25:11.500 --> 1:25:16.500
 So the more you protect your immune system from exposure,

1:25:16.700 --> 1:25:18.820
 the less opportunity it has to learn

1:25:18.820 --> 1:25:23.100
 about non self repertoire in a way that prepares it

1:25:23.100 --> 1:25:24.380
 for the next insult.

1:25:24.380 --> 1:25:25.860
 So that's the horizontal thing too,

1:25:25.860 --> 1:25:28.100
 like the, so it's throughout your lifetime

1:25:28.100 --> 1:25:33.100
 and the lifetime of the people that, your ancestors,

1:25:33.220 --> 1:25:34.060
 that kind of thing.

1:25:34.060 --> 1:25:35.060
 What about the...

1:25:35.060 --> 1:25:37.900
 So again, it returns against free will.

1:25:37.900 --> 1:25:39.540
 On the free will side of things,

1:25:39.540 --> 1:25:40.980
 is there something we could do

1:25:40.980 --> 1:25:44.780
 to strengthen our immune system in 2020?

1:25:44.780 --> 1:25:49.100
 Is there like, you know, exercise, diet,

1:25:49.100 --> 1:25:50.700
 all that kind of stuff?

1:25:50.700 --> 1:25:52.900
 So it's kind of funny.

1:25:52.900 --> 1:25:55.940
 There's a cartoon that basically shows two windows

1:25:55.940 --> 1:25:58.300
 with a teller in each window.

1:25:58.300 --> 1:26:02.220
 One has a humongous line and the other one has no one.

1:26:02.220 --> 1:26:04.700
 The one that has no one above says health.

1:26:04.700 --> 1:26:07.220
 No, it says exercise and diet.

1:26:07.220 --> 1:26:08.660
 And the other one says pill.

1:26:10.300 --> 1:26:12.140
 And there's a huge line for pill.

1:26:12.140 --> 1:26:13.940
 So we're looking basically for magic bullets

1:26:13.940 --> 1:26:16.860
 for sort of ways that we can, you know,

1:26:16.860 --> 1:26:18.980
 beat cancer and beat coronavirus and beat this

1:26:18.980 --> 1:26:19.820
 and beat that.

1:26:19.820 --> 1:26:21.420
 And it turns out that the window with like,

1:26:21.420 --> 1:26:23.980
 just diet and exercise is the best way

1:26:23.980 --> 1:26:26.100
 to boost every aspect of your health.

1:26:26.100 --> 1:26:31.100
 If you look at Alzheimer's, exercise and nutrition.

1:26:31.220 --> 1:26:32.580
 I mean, you're like, really?

1:26:32.580 --> 1:26:34.700
 For my brain, neurodegeneration?

1:26:34.700 --> 1:26:36.140
 Absolutely.

1:26:36.140 --> 1:26:39.340
 If you look at cancer, exercise and nutrition.

1:26:40.420 --> 1:26:43.780
 If you look at coronavirus, exercise and nutrition,

1:26:43.780 --> 1:26:47.300
 every single aspect of human health gets improved.

1:26:47.300 --> 1:26:48.620
 And one of the studies we're doing now

1:26:48.620 --> 1:26:51.260
 is basically looking at what are the effects

1:26:51.260 --> 1:26:52.940
 of diet and exercise?

1:26:52.940 --> 1:26:55.340
 How similar are they to each other?

1:26:55.340 --> 1:26:58.220
 We basically take in diet intervention

1:26:58.220 --> 1:27:01.380
 and exercise intervention in human and in mice.

1:27:01.380 --> 1:27:03.580
 And we're basically doing single cell profiling

1:27:03.580 --> 1:27:04.980
 of a bunch of different tissues

1:27:04.980 --> 1:27:08.020
 to basically understand how are the cells,

1:27:08.020 --> 1:27:10.900
 both the stromal cells and the immune cells

1:27:10.900 --> 1:27:13.260
 of each of these tissues responding

1:27:13.260 --> 1:27:15.100
 to the effect of exercise.

1:27:15.100 --> 1:27:16.900
 What are the communication networks

1:27:16.900 --> 1:27:18.540
 between different cells?

1:27:18.540 --> 1:27:23.540
 Where the muscle that exercises sends signals

1:27:23.900 --> 1:27:25.980
 through the bloodstream, through the lymphatic system,

1:27:25.980 --> 1:27:27.660
 through all kinds of other systems

1:27:27.660 --> 1:27:31.580
 that give signals to other cells that I have exercised

1:27:31.580 --> 1:27:33.980
 and you should change in this particular way,

1:27:33.980 --> 1:27:37.620
 which basically reconfigure those receptor cells

1:27:37.620 --> 1:27:39.860
 with the effect of exercise.

1:27:39.860 --> 1:27:43.860
 How well understood is those reconfigurations?

1:27:43.860 --> 1:27:44.700
 Very little.

1:27:44.700 --> 1:27:46.940
 We're just starting now, basically.

1:27:46.940 --> 1:27:51.020
 Is the hope there to understand the effect on,

1:27:52.420 --> 1:27:54.300
 so like the effect on the immune system?

1:27:54.300 --> 1:27:56.220
 On the immune system, the effect on brain,

1:27:56.220 --> 1:27:59.060
 the effect on your liver, on your digestive system,

1:27:59.060 --> 1:28:00.900
 on your adipocytes?

1:28:00.900 --> 1:28:03.620
 Adipose, the most misunderstood organ.

1:28:03.620 --> 1:28:05.780
 Everybody thinks, oh, fat, terrible.

1:28:05.780 --> 1:28:07.460
 No, fat is awesome.

1:28:07.460 --> 1:28:09.940
 Your fat cells is what's keeping you alive

1:28:09.940 --> 1:28:11.420
 because if you didn't have your fat cells,

1:28:11.420 --> 1:28:13.940
 all those lipids and all those calories

1:28:13.940 --> 1:28:15.420
 would be floating around in your blood

1:28:15.420 --> 1:28:16.940
 and you'd be dead by now.

1:28:16.940 --> 1:28:18.460
 Your adipocytes are your best friend.

1:28:18.460 --> 1:28:21.820
 They're basically storing all these excess calories

1:28:21.820 --> 1:28:24.900
 so that they don't hurt all of the rest of the body.

1:28:24.900 --> 1:28:28.940
 And they're also fat burning in many ways.

1:28:28.940 --> 1:28:31.540
 So, again, when you don't have

1:28:31.540 --> 1:28:33.460
 the homozygous version that I have,

1:28:33.460 --> 1:28:36.500
 your cells are able to burn calories much more easily

1:28:36.500 --> 1:28:39.980
 by sort of flipping a master metabolic switch

1:28:39.980 --> 1:28:42.380
 that involves this FTO locus that I mentioned earlier

1:28:42.380 --> 1:28:45.060
 and its target genes, RX3 and RX5,

1:28:45.060 --> 1:28:47.540
 that basically switch your adipocytes

1:28:47.540 --> 1:28:50.780
 during their three first days of differentiation

1:28:50.780 --> 1:28:52.300
 as they're becoming mature adipocytes

1:28:52.300 --> 1:28:54.340
 to basically become either fat burning

1:28:54.340 --> 1:28:57.100
 or fat storing fat cells.

1:28:57.100 --> 1:28:58.980
 And the fat burning fat cells are your best friend.

1:28:58.980 --> 1:29:00.460
 They're much closer to muscle

1:29:00.460 --> 1:29:02.820
 than they are to white adipocytes.

1:29:02.820 --> 1:29:05.340
 Is there a lot of difference between people

1:29:05.340 --> 1:29:09.540
 that you could give, science could eventually give advice

1:29:09.540 --> 1:29:12.260
 that is very generalizable

1:29:12.260 --> 1:29:16.100
 or is our differences in our genetic makeup,

1:29:16.100 --> 1:29:18.700
 like you mentioned, is that going to be basically

1:29:18.700 --> 1:29:22.800
 something we have to be very specialized individuals,

1:29:22.800 --> 1:29:24.900
 any advice we give in terms of diet,

1:29:24.900 --> 1:29:25.740
 like what we were just talking about?

1:29:25.740 --> 1:29:28.380
 Believe it or not, the most personalized advice

1:29:28.380 --> 1:29:29.620
 that you give for nutrition

1:29:29.620 --> 1:29:31.460
 don't have to do with your genome.

1:29:31.460 --> 1:29:34.420
 They have to do with your gut microbiome,

1:29:34.420 --> 1:29:35.900
 with the bacteria that live inside you.

1:29:35.900 --> 1:29:37.940
 So most of your digestion is actually happening

1:29:37.940 --> 1:29:40.800
 by species that are not human inside you.

1:29:40.800 --> 1:29:43.060
 You have more nonhuman cells than you have human cells.

1:29:43.060 --> 1:29:46.740
 You're basically a giant bag of bacteria

1:29:46.740 --> 1:29:48.320
 with a few human cells along.

1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:53.120
 And those do not necessarily have to do

1:29:53.120 --> 1:29:54.900
 with your genetic makeup.

1:29:54.900 --> 1:29:56.760
 They interact with your genetic makeup.

1:29:56.760 --> 1:29:58.000
 They interact with your epigenome.

1:29:58.000 --> 1:29:59.600
 They interact with your nutrition.

1:29:59.600 --> 1:30:01.280
 They interact with your environment.

1:30:01.280 --> 1:30:06.280
 They're basically an additional source of variation.

1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:08.120
 So when you're thinking about sort of

1:30:08.120 --> 1:30:10.080
 personalized nutritional advice,

1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:13.640
 part of that is actually how do you match your microbiome?

1:30:13.640 --> 1:30:17.080
 And part of that is how do we match your genetics?

1:30:17.080 --> 1:30:22.080
 But again, this is a very diverse set of contributors.

1:30:22.160 --> 1:30:24.640
 And the effect sizes are not enormous.

1:30:24.640 --> 1:30:27.920
 So I think the science for that is not fully developed yet.

1:30:27.920 --> 1:30:28.760
 Speaking of diets,

1:30:28.760 --> 1:30:30.640
 because I've wrestled in combat sports,

1:30:30.640 --> 1:30:32.640
 but sports my whole life were weight matters.

1:30:32.640 --> 1:30:35.340
 So you have to cut and all that stuff.

1:30:35.340 --> 1:30:38.240
 One thing I've learned a lot about my body,

1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:39.900
 and it seems to be, I think,

1:30:39.900 --> 1:30:41.680
 true about other people's bodies,

1:30:41.680 --> 1:30:45.120
 is that you can adjust to a lot of things.

1:30:45.120 --> 1:30:48.280
 That's the miraculous thing about this biological system,

1:30:48.280 --> 1:30:52.360
 is like I fast often.

1:30:52.360 --> 1:30:54.920
 I used to eat like five, six times a day

1:30:54.920 --> 1:30:57.020
 and thought that was absolutely necessary.

1:30:57.020 --> 1:30:58.960
 How could you not eat that often?

1:30:58.960 --> 1:31:01.320
 And then when I started fasting,

1:31:01.320 --> 1:31:02.720
 your body adjusted to that.

1:31:02.720 --> 1:31:04.360
 And you learn how to not eat.

1:31:04.360 --> 1:31:07.600
 And it was, if you just give it a chance

1:31:07.600 --> 1:31:09.140
 for a few weeks, actually,

1:31:09.140 --> 1:31:10.320
 over a period of a few weeks,

1:31:10.320 --> 1:31:11.800
 your body can adjust to anything.

1:31:11.800 --> 1:31:14.120
 And that's a miraculous, that's such a beautiful thing.

1:31:14.120 --> 1:31:15.480
 So I'm a computer scientist,

1:31:15.480 --> 1:31:18.040
 and I've basically gone through periods of 24 hours

1:31:18.040 --> 1:31:19.680
 without eating or stopping.

1:31:19.680 --> 1:31:22.080
 And then I'm like, oh, must eat.

1:31:22.080 --> 1:31:23.080
 And I eat a ton.

1:31:23.080 --> 1:31:25.440
 I used to order two pizzas just with my brother.

1:31:27.440 --> 1:31:29.720
 So I've gone through these extremes as well,

1:31:29.720 --> 1:31:32.160
 and I've gone the whole intermittent fasting thing.

1:31:32.160 --> 1:31:35.200
 So I can sympathize with you both on the seven meals a day

1:31:35.200 --> 1:31:37.580
 to the zero meals a day.

1:31:37.580 --> 1:31:40.820
 So I think when I say everything with moderation,

1:31:40.820 --> 1:31:44.400
 I actually think your body responds interestingly

1:31:44.400 --> 1:31:47.400
 to these different changes in diet.

1:31:47.400 --> 1:31:49.920
 I think part of the reason why we lose weight

1:31:49.920 --> 1:31:52.220
 with pretty much every kind of change in behavior

1:31:52.220 --> 1:31:55.960
 is because our epigenome and the set of proteins

1:31:55.960 --> 1:31:58.640
 and enzymes that are expressed and our microbiome

1:31:58.640 --> 1:32:02.080
 are not well suited to that nutritional source.

1:32:02.080 --> 1:32:03.880
 And therefore, they will not be able

1:32:03.880 --> 1:32:06.680
 to sort of catch everything that you give them.

1:32:06.680 --> 1:32:09.160
 And then a lot of that will go undigested.

1:32:09.160 --> 1:32:11.920
 And that basically means that your body can then

1:32:11.920 --> 1:32:13.200
 lose weight in the short term,

1:32:13.200 --> 1:32:16.160
 but very quickly will adjust to that new normal.

1:32:16.160 --> 1:32:18.200
 And then we'll be able to sort of perhaps gain

1:32:18.200 --> 1:32:20.400
 a lot of weight from the diet.

1:32:20.400 --> 1:32:24.400
 So anyway, I mean, there's also studies in factories

1:32:24.400 --> 1:32:27.200
 where basically people dim the lights

1:32:27.200 --> 1:32:28.720
 and then suddenly everybody started working better.

1:32:28.720 --> 1:32:30.160
 It was like, wow, that's amazing.

1:32:30.160 --> 1:32:32.840
 Three weeks later, they made the lights a little brighter.

1:32:32.840 --> 1:32:34.360
 Everybody started working better.

1:32:34.360 --> 1:32:39.360
 So any kind of intervention has a placebo effect of,

1:32:39.440 --> 1:32:41.320
 wow, now I'm healthier and I'm gonna be running

1:32:41.320 --> 1:32:42.160
 more often, et cetera.

1:32:42.160 --> 1:32:44.600
 So it's very hard to uncouple the placebo effect

1:32:44.600 --> 1:32:47.080
 of, wow, I'm doing something to intervene on my diet

1:32:47.080 --> 1:32:50.280
 from the, wow, this is actually the right thing for me.

1:32:50.280 --> 1:32:51.120
 So, you know.

1:32:51.120 --> 1:32:53.200
 Yeah, from the perspective from a nutrition science,

1:32:53.200 --> 1:32:55.760
 psychology, both things I'm interested in,

1:32:55.760 --> 1:32:59.560
 especially psychology, it seems that it's extremely difficult

1:32:59.560 --> 1:33:03.440
 to do good science because there's so many variables

1:33:03.440 --> 1:33:06.560
 involved, it's so difficult to control the variables,

1:33:06.560 --> 1:33:10.280
 so difficult to do sufficiently large scale experiments,

1:33:10.280 --> 1:33:12.840
 both sort of in terms of the number of subjects

1:33:12.840 --> 1:33:17.040
 and temporal, like how long you do the study for,

1:33:17.040 --> 1:33:20.720
 that it just seems like it's not even a real science

1:33:20.720 --> 1:33:22.640
 for now, like nutrition science.

1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:24.840
 I wanna jump into the whole placebo effect

1:33:24.840 --> 1:33:25.840
 for a little bit here.

1:33:25.840 --> 1:33:30.200
 And basically talk about the implications of that.

1:33:30.200 --> 1:33:33.400
 If I give you a sugar pill and I tell you it's a sugar pill,

1:33:33.400 --> 1:33:35.520
 you won't get any better.

1:33:35.520 --> 1:33:38.240
 But if I tell you a sugar pill and I tell you,

1:33:38.240 --> 1:33:40.000
 wow, this is an amazing drug,

1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:42.240
 it actually will stop your cancer,

1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:46.280
 your cancer will actually stop with much higher probability.

1:33:46.280 --> 1:33:47.120
 What does that mean?

1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:47.960
 That's so amazing.

1:33:47.960 --> 1:33:49.920
 That means that if I can trick your brain

1:33:49.920 --> 1:33:51.840
 into thinking that I'm healing you,

1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:54.560
 your brain will basically figure out a way to heal itself,

1:33:54.560 --> 1:33:55.920
 to heal the body.

1:33:55.920 --> 1:33:58.600
 And that tells us that there's so much

1:33:58.600 --> 1:34:01.440
 that we don't understand in the interplay

1:34:01.440 --> 1:34:04.200
 between our cognition and our biology,

1:34:05.320 --> 1:34:08.400
 that if we were able to better harvest

1:34:08.400 --> 1:34:12.320
 the power of our brain to sort of impact the body

1:34:12.320 --> 1:34:14.200
 through the placebo effect,

1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:17.280
 we would be so much better in so many different things.

1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:19.200
 Just by tricking yourself into thinking

1:34:19.200 --> 1:34:21.560
 that you're doing better, you're actually doing better.

1:34:21.560 --> 1:34:22.640
 So there's something to be said

1:34:22.640 --> 1:34:25.040
 about sort of positive thinking, about optimism,

1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:30.040
 about sort of just getting your brain

1:34:30.040 --> 1:34:33.000
 and your mind into the right mindset

1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:36.920
 that helps your body and helps your entire biology.

1:34:36.920 --> 1:34:39.840
 Yeah, from a science perspective, that's just fascinating.

1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:41.600
 Obviously most things about the brain

1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:43.640
 is a total mystery for now,

1:34:43.640 --> 1:34:46.160
 but that's a fascinating interplay

1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:51.160
 that the brain can help cure cancer.

1:34:54.240 --> 1:34:55.840
 I don't even know what to do with that.

1:34:55.840 --> 1:34:59.120
 I mean, the way to think about that is the following.

1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:01.240
 The converse of the equation is something

1:35:01.240 --> 1:35:03.120
 that we are much more comfortable with.

1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:05.720
 Like, oh, if you're stressed,

1:35:05.720 --> 1:35:08.200
 then your heart rate might rise

1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:10.960
 and all kinds of sort of toxins might be released

1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:13.600
 and that can have a detrimental effect in your body,

1:35:13.600 --> 1:35:14.800
 et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1:35:14.800 --> 1:35:18.080
 So maybe it's easier to understand your body

1:35:18.080 --> 1:35:20.040
 healing from your mind

1:35:20.040 --> 1:35:23.040
 by your mind is not killing your body,

1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:24.560
 or at least it's killing it less.

1:35:24.560 --> 1:35:28.000
 So I think that aspect of the stress equation

1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:31.800
 is a little easier for most of us to conceptualize,

1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:35.160
 but then the healing part is perhaps the same pathways,

1:35:35.160 --> 1:35:36.160
 perhaps different pathways,

1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:39.520
 but again, something that is totally untapped scientifically.

1:35:39.520 --> 1:35:42.920
 I think we try to bring this question up a couple of times,

1:35:42.920 --> 1:35:44.640
 but let's return to it again,

1:35:44.640 --> 1:35:46.440
 is what do you think is the difference

1:35:46.440 --> 1:35:49.480
 between the way a computer represents information,

1:35:49.480 --> 1:35:53.120
 the human genome represents and stores information?

1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:55.560
 And maybe broadly, what is the difference

1:35:55.560 --> 1:35:57.840
 between how you think about computers

1:35:57.840 --> 1:36:00.400
 and how you think about biological systems?

1:36:00.400 --> 1:36:02.520
 So I made a very provocative claim earlier

1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:04.360
 that we are a digital computer.

1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:06.360
 Like I said, at the core lies a digital code

1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:07.520
 and that's true in many ways,

1:36:07.520 --> 1:36:09.480
 but surrounding that digital core,

1:36:09.480 --> 1:36:11.440
 there's a huge amount of analog.

1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:13.680
 If you look at our brain, it's not really digital.

1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:15.760
 If you look at our sort of RNA

1:36:15.760 --> 1:36:17.160
 and all of that stuff inside our cell,

1:36:17.160 --> 1:36:18.000
 it's not really digital.

1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:19.840
 It's really analog in many ways,

1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:22.800
 but let's start with the code

1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:24.800
 and then we'll expand to the rest.

1:36:24.800 --> 1:36:27.800
 So the code itself is digital.

1:36:27.800 --> 1:36:28.680
 So there's genes.

1:36:28.680 --> 1:36:30.840
 You can think of the genes as, I don't know,

1:36:30.840 --> 1:36:33.840
 the procedures, the functions inside your language.

1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:36.400
 And then somehow you have to turn these functions on.

1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:37.320
 How do you call a gene?

1:36:37.320 --> 1:36:39.360
 How do you call that function?

1:36:39.360 --> 1:36:41.880
 The way that you would do it in old programming languages

1:36:41.880 --> 1:36:44.560
 is go to address whatever in your memory

1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:46.240
 and then you'd start running from there.

1:36:46.240 --> 1:36:48.920
 And modern programming languages

1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:50.800
 have encapsulated this into functions

1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:52.000
 and objects and all of that.

1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.560
 And it's nice and cute, but in the end, deep down,

1:36:54.560 --> 1:36:55.560
 there's still an assembly code

1:36:55.560 --> 1:36:57.600
 that says go to that instruction

1:36:57.600 --> 1:36:59.680
 and it runs that instruction.

1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:01.600
 If you look at the human genome

1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:05.000
 and the genome of pretty much most species out there,

1:37:06.800 --> 1:37:08.160
 there's no go to function.

1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:12.520
 You just don't start transcribing in position 13,000,

1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:18.760
 13,527 in chromosome 12.

1:37:18.760 --> 1:37:21.920
 You instead have content based indexing.

1:37:21.920 --> 1:37:25.120
 So at every location in the genome,

1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:28.760
 in front of the genes that need to be turned on,

1:37:28.760 --> 1:37:30.560
 I don't know, when you drink coffee,

1:37:30.560 --> 1:37:34.440
 there's a little coffee marker in front of all of them.

1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:38.480
 And whenever your cells that metabolize coffee

1:37:38.480 --> 1:37:39.760
 need to metabolize coffee,

1:37:39.760 --> 1:37:41.280
 they basically see coffee and they're like,

1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:44.720
 ooh, let's go turn on all the coffee marked genes.

1:37:44.720 --> 1:37:48.040
 So there's basically these small motifs,

1:37:48.040 --> 1:37:50.840
 these small sequences that we call regulatory motifs.

1:37:50.840 --> 1:37:52.040
 They're like patterns of DNA.

1:37:52.040 --> 1:37:54.680
 They're only eight characters long or so,

1:37:54.680 --> 1:37:57.040
 like GAT, GCA, et cetera.

1:37:57.920 --> 1:38:01.560
 And these motifs work in combinations

1:38:01.560 --> 1:38:06.320
 and every one of them has some recruitment affinity

1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:09.520
 for a different protein that will then come and bind it

1:38:09.520 --> 1:38:11.840
 and together collections of these motifs

1:38:11.840 --> 1:38:15.440
 create regions that we call regulatory regions

1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:19.280
 that can be either promoters near the beginning of the gene

1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:20.160
 and that basically tells you

1:38:20.160 --> 1:38:22.480
 where the function actually starts, where you call it,

1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:26.200
 and then enhancers that are looping around of the DNA

1:38:26.200 --> 1:38:28.200
 that basically bring the machinery

1:38:28.200 --> 1:38:29.800
 that binds those enhancers

1:38:29.800 --> 1:38:32.520
 and then bring it onto the promoter,

1:38:32.520 --> 1:38:36.080
 which then recruits the right sort of the ribosome

1:38:36.080 --> 1:38:37.800
 and the polymerase and all of that thing,

1:38:37.800 --> 1:38:40.560
 which will first transcribe and then export

1:38:40.560 --> 1:38:42.680
 and then eventually translate in the cytoplasm,

1:38:42.680 --> 1:38:44.480
 you know, whatever RNA molecule.

1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:50.520
 So the beauty of the way

1:38:50.520 --> 1:38:54.280
 that the digital computer that's the genome works

1:38:54.280 --> 1:38:57.960
 is that it's extremely fault tolerant.

1:38:57.960 --> 1:38:59.480
 If I took your hard drive

1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:03.160
 and I messed with 20% of the letters in it,

1:39:03.160 --> 1:39:05.880
 of the zeros and ones and I flipped them,

1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:07.400
 you'd be in trouble.

1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:10.320
 If I take the genome and I flipped 20% of the letters,

1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:12.960
 you probably won't even notice.

1:39:13.880 --> 1:39:15.320
 And that resilience.

1:39:15.320 --> 1:39:16.720
 That's fascinating, yeah.

1:39:16.720 --> 1:39:18.840
 Is a key design principle.

1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:20.760
 And again, I'm anthropomorphizing here,

1:39:20.760 --> 1:39:22.400
 but it's a key driving principle

1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:24.320
 of how biological systems work.

1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:27.880
 They're first resilient and then anything else.

1:39:27.880 --> 1:39:32.160
 And when you look at this incredible beauty of life

1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:35.480
 from the most, I don't know, beautiful,

1:39:35.480 --> 1:39:38.280
 I don't know, human genome maybe of humanity

1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:40.840
 and all of the ideals that should come with it

1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:42.360
 to the most terrifying genome,

1:39:42.360 --> 1:39:45.520
 like, I don't know, COVID 19, SARS COVID 2

1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:47.640
 and the current pandemic,

1:39:47.640 --> 1:39:50.280
 you basically see this elegance

1:39:50.280 --> 1:39:54.520
 as the epitome of clean design,

1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:55.920
 but it's dirty.

1:39:55.920 --> 1:39:57.280
 It's a mess.

1:39:57.280 --> 1:40:02.200
 It's, you know, the way to get there is hugely messy.

1:40:02.200 --> 1:40:04.400
 And that's something that we as computer scientists

1:40:04.400 --> 1:40:06.120
 don't embrace.

1:40:06.120 --> 1:40:08.040
 We like to have clean code.

1:40:08.040 --> 1:40:10.360
 You know, like in engineering,

1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:12.240
 they teach you about compartmentalization,

1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:13.720
 about sort of separating functions,

1:40:13.720 --> 1:40:17.080
 about modularity, about hierarchical design.

1:40:17.080 --> 1:40:19.040
 None of that applies in biology.

1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:19.880
 Testing.

1:40:19.880 --> 1:40:22.320
 Testing, sure.

1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:24.200
 Yeah, biology does plenty of that.

1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:26.800
 But I mean, through evolutionary exploration.

1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:31.040
 But if you look at biological systems,

1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:33.440
 first they are robust

1:40:33.440 --> 1:40:36.680
 and then they specialize to become anything else.

1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:38.240
 And if you look at viruses,

1:40:38.240 --> 1:40:41.040
 the reason why they're so elegant

1:40:41.040 --> 1:40:44.600
 when you look at the design of this, you know, genome,

1:40:44.600 --> 1:40:46.120
 it seems so elegant.

1:40:46.120 --> 1:40:49.680
 And the reason for that is that it's been stripped down

1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:51.600
 from something much larger

1:40:51.600 --> 1:40:53.960
 because of the pressure to keep it compact.

1:40:53.960 --> 1:40:56.040
 So many compact genomes out there

1:40:56.040 --> 1:40:58.680
 have ancestors that were much larger.

1:40:58.680 --> 1:41:00.760
 You don't start small and become big.

1:41:00.760 --> 1:41:03.640
 You go through a loop of add a bunch of stuff,

1:41:03.640 --> 1:41:07.240
 increase complexity, and then, you know, slim it down.

1:41:07.240 --> 1:41:12.120
 And one of my early papers was in fact on genome duplication.

1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:14.080
 One of the things we found is that baker's yeast,

1:41:14.080 --> 1:41:17.600
 which is the, you know, yeast that you use to make bread,

1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:19.480
 but also the yeast that you use to make wine,

1:41:19.480 --> 1:41:20.960
 which is basically the dominant species

1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:22.360
 when you go in the fields of Tuscany

1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:24.040
 and you say, you know, what's out there,

1:41:24.040 --> 1:41:26.320
 it's basically saccharomyces cerevisiae,

1:41:26.320 --> 1:41:27.880
 or the way my Italian friends say,

1:41:27.880 --> 1:41:30.120
 saccharomyces cerevisiae.

1:41:30.120 --> 1:41:33.000
 So, so.

1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:34.480
 Oh, which means what?

1:41:34.480 --> 1:41:36.680
 Oh, saccharomyces, okay, I'm sorry, I'm Greek.

1:41:36.680 --> 1:41:39.680
 So yeah, zacharo, mikis, zacharo is sugar,

1:41:39.680 --> 1:41:41.120
 mikis is fungus.

1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:44.520
 Yes, cerevisiae, cerveza, beer.

1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:47.200
 So it means the sugar fungus of beer.

1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:48.040
 Yeah.

1:41:48.040 --> 1:41:51.080
 You know, less, less sounding to the ear.

1:41:51.080 --> 1:41:52.840
 Still poetic, yeah.

1:41:52.840 --> 1:41:54.960
 So anyway, saccharomyces cerevisiae,

1:41:54.960 --> 1:41:57.040
 basically the major baker's yeast out there

1:41:57.040 --> 1:42:00.440
 is the descendant of a whole genome duplication.

1:42:00.440 --> 1:42:02.880
 Why would a whole gene duplication even happen?

1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:06.080
 When it happened is coinciding

1:42:06.080 --> 1:42:08.240
 with about a hundred million years ago

1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:12.920
 and the emergence of fruit bearing plants.

1:42:14.320 --> 1:42:15.560
 Why fruit bearing plants?

1:42:15.560 --> 1:42:19.040
 Because animals would eat the fruit

1:42:19.040 --> 1:42:23.640
 and would walk around and poop huge amounts of nutrients

1:42:23.640 --> 1:42:26.480
 along with a seed for the plants to spread.

1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:29.000
 Before that, plants were not spreading through animals,

1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:30.480
 they were spreading through wind

1:42:30.480 --> 1:42:32.360
 and all kinds of other ways.

1:42:32.360 --> 1:42:34.720
 But basically the moment you have fruit bearing plants,

1:42:34.720 --> 1:42:38.760
 these plants are basically creating this abundance

1:42:38.760 --> 1:42:40.240
 of sugar in the environment.

1:42:40.240 --> 1:42:42.920
 So there's an evolutionary niche that gets created.

1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:44.080
 And in that evolutionary niche,

1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:46.640
 you basically have enough sugar

1:42:46.640 --> 1:42:48.680
 that a whole genome duplication,

1:42:48.680 --> 1:42:51.040
 which initially is a very messy event,

1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:53.760
 allows you to then, you know,

1:42:53.760 --> 1:42:56.000
 relieve some of that complexity.

1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:59.520
 So I had to pause, what does genome duplication mean?

1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:03.200
 That basically means that instead of having eight chromosomes,

1:43:03.200 --> 1:43:04.920
 you can now have 16 chromosomes.

1:43:06.240 --> 1:43:09.600
 So, but the duplication at first,

1:43:09.600 --> 1:43:13.760
 when you go to 16, you're not using that.

1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:15.120
 Oh yeah, you are.

1:43:15.120 --> 1:43:17.280
 Yeah, so basically from one day to the next,

1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:18.600
 you went from having eight chromosomes

1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:20.280
 to having 16 chromosomes.

1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:22.920
 Probably a non disjunction event during a duplication,

1:43:22.920 --> 1:43:24.160
 during a division.

1:43:24.160 --> 1:43:25.800
 So you basically divide the cell

1:43:25.800 --> 1:43:27.760
 instead of half the genome going this way

1:43:27.760 --> 1:43:29.000
 and half the genome going the other way

1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:30.640
 after duplication of the genome,

1:43:30.640 --> 1:43:33.000
 you basically have all of it going to one cell

1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:35.840
 and then there's sufficient messiness there

1:43:35.840 --> 1:43:38.320
 that you end up with slight differences

1:43:38.320 --> 1:43:39.760
 that make most of these chromosomes

1:43:39.760 --> 1:43:40.920
 be actually preserved.

1:43:42.280 --> 1:43:43.120
 It's a long story short to me.

1:43:43.120 --> 1:43:45.000
 But that's a big upgrade, right?

1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:45.840
 So that's...

1:43:45.840 --> 1:43:46.760
 Not necessarily,

1:43:46.760 --> 1:43:48.480
 because what happens immediately thereafter

1:43:48.480 --> 1:43:50.320
 is that you start massively losing

1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:52.280
 tons of those duplicated genes.

1:43:52.280 --> 1:43:55.360
 So 90% of those genes were actually lost

1:43:55.360 --> 1:43:58.160
 very rapidly after whole gene duplication.

1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:01.680
 And the reason for that is that biology is not intelligent,

1:44:01.680 --> 1:44:06.480
 it's just ruthless selection, random mutation.

1:44:06.480 --> 1:44:08.520
 So the ruthless selection basically means

1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:11.400
 that as soon as one of the random mutations hit one gene,

1:44:11.400 --> 1:44:13.360
 ruthless selection just kills off that gene.

1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:14.200
 It's just,

1:44:16.680 --> 1:44:19.520
 if you have a pressure to maintain a small compact genome,

1:44:19.520 --> 1:44:21.680
 you will very rapidly lose the second copy

1:44:21.680 --> 1:44:24.240
 of most of your genes and a small number 10%

1:44:24.240 --> 1:44:25.720
 were kept in two copies.

1:44:25.720 --> 1:44:28.800
 And those had to do a lot with environment adaptation,

1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:31.080
 with the speed of replication,

1:44:31.080 --> 1:44:34.240
 with the speed of translation and with sugar processing.

1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:36.000
 So I'm making a long story short

1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:38.720
 to basically say that evolution is messy.

1:44:38.720 --> 1:44:39.960
 The only way...

1:44:39.960 --> 1:44:42.160
 Like, so the example that I was giving

1:44:42.160 --> 1:44:45.840
 of messing with 20% of your bits in your computer,

1:44:45.840 --> 1:44:47.200
 totally bogus.

1:44:47.200 --> 1:44:48.720
 Duplicating all your functions

1:44:48.720 --> 1:44:51.880
 and just throwing them out there in the same function,

1:44:51.880 --> 1:44:52.840
 just totally bogus.

1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:55.200
 Like this would never work in an engineer system.

1:44:55.200 --> 1:44:56.960
 But biological systems,

1:44:56.960 --> 1:44:59.080
 because of this content based indexing

1:44:59.080 --> 1:45:01.880
 and because of this modularity that comes

1:45:01.880 --> 1:45:04.200
 from the fact that the gene is controlled

1:45:04.200 --> 1:45:05.200
 by a series of tags.

1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:08.160
 And now if you need this gene in another setting,

1:45:08.160 --> 1:45:09.760
 you just add some more tags

1:45:09.760 --> 1:45:12.560
 that will basically turn it on also in those settings.

1:45:12.560 --> 1:45:17.280
 So this gene is now pressured to do two different functions

1:45:17.280 --> 1:45:19.760
 and it builds up complexity.

1:45:19.760 --> 1:45:21.240
 I see a whole gene duplication

1:45:21.240 --> 1:45:22.560
 and gene duplication in general

1:45:22.560 --> 1:45:24.560
 as a way to relieve that complexity.

1:45:24.560 --> 1:45:26.640
 So you have this gradual buildup of complexity

1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:30.920
 as functions get sort of added onto the existing genes.

1:45:30.920 --> 1:45:34.160
 And then boom, you duplicate your workforce.

1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:36.720
 And you now have two copies of this gene.

1:45:36.720 --> 1:45:38.760
 One will probably specialize to do one

1:45:38.760 --> 1:45:40.440
 and the other one will specialize to do the other

1:45:40.440 --> 1:45:42.160
 or one will maintain the ancestral function.

1:45:42.160 --> 1:45:44.800
 The other one will sort of be free to evolve

1:45:44.800 --> 1:45:47.720
 and specialize while losing the ancestral function

1:45:47.720 --> 1:45:48.640
 and so on and so forth.

1:45:48.640 --> 1:45:49.960
 So that's how genomes evolve.

1:45:49.960 --> 1:45:52.040
 They're just messy things,

1:45:52.040 --> 1:45:54.600
 but they're extremely fault tolerant

1:45:54.600 --> 1:45:58.400
 and they're extremely able to deal with mutations

1:45:58.400 --> 1:46:03.400
 because that's the very way that you generate new functions.

1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:05.440
 So new functionalization comes

1:46:05.440 --> 1:46:07.720
 from the very thing that breaks it.

1:46:07.720 --> 1:46:09.120
 So even in the current pandemic,

1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:12.560
 many people are asking me which mutations matter the most.

1:46:12.560 --> 1:46:13.800
 And what I tell them is,

1:46:13.800 --> 1:46:16.240
 well, we can study the evolutionary dynamics

1:46:16.240 --> 1:46:19.520
 of the current genome to then understand

1:46:19.520 --> 1:46:23.120
 which mutations have previously happened or not.

1:46:23.120 --> 1:46:26.040
 And which mutations happen in genes

1:46:26.040 --> 1:46:28.040
 that evolve rapidly or not.

1:46:28.040 --> 1:46:29.720
 And one of the things we found, for example,

1:46:29.720 --> 1:46:33.840
 is that the genes that evolved rapidly in the past

1:46:33.840 --> 1:46:36.720
 are still evolving rapidly now in the current pandemic.

1:46:36.720 --> 1:46:38.680
 The genes that evolved slowly in the past

1:46:38.680 --> 1:46:40.040
 are still evolving slowly.

1:46:40.040 --> 1:46:41.720
 Which means that they're useful?

1:46:41.720 --> 1:46:43.360
 Which means that they're under

1:46:43.360 --> 1:46:45.280
 the same evolutionary pressures.

1:46:45.280 --> 1:46:49.440
 But then the question is what happens in specific mutations?

1:46:49.440 --> 1:46:52.560
 So if you look at the D614 gene mutations,

1:46:52.560 --> 1:46:53.840
 that's been all over the news.

1:46:53.840 --> 1:46:58.840
 So in position 614, in the amino acids 614 of the S protein,

1:46:59.720 --> 1:47:02.120
 there's a D2 gene mutation

1:47:02.120 --> 1:47:05.840
 that sort of has creeped over the population.

1:47:07.040 --> 1:47:10.040
 That mutation, we found out through my work,

1:47:10.040 --> 1:47:13.480
 disrupts a perfectly conserved nucleotide position

1:47:13.480 --> 1:47:15.800
 that has never been changed in the history

1:47:15.800 --> 1:47:17.920
 of millions of years of equivalent

1:47:17.920 --> 1:47:22.920
 per million evolution of these viruses.

1:47:23.080 --> 1:47:25.960
 That basically means that it's a completely new adaptation

1:47:25.960 --> 1:47:27.480
 to human.

1:47:27.480 --> 1:47:30.840
 And that mutation has now gone from 1% frequency

1:47:30.840 --> 1:47:33.800
 to 90% frequency in almost all outbreaks.

1:47:33.800 --> 1:47:38.800
 So this mutation, I like how you say the 416,

1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:39.720
 what was it, okay.

1:47:39.720 --> 1:47:40.640
 Yeah, 614, sorry.

1:47:40.640 --> 1:47:41.480
 614.

1:47:41.480 --> 1:47:43.200
 D614G.

1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:46.560
 D614, so literally, so what you're saying

1:47:46.560 --> 1:47:48.440
 is this is like a chess move.

1:47:48.440 --> 1:47:50.560
 So it just mutated one letter to another.

1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:51.400
 Exactly.

1:47:51.400 --> 1:47:53.000
 And that hasn't happened before.

1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:54.320
 Yeah, never.

1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:58.120
 And this somehow, this mutation is really useful.

1:47:58.120 --> 1:48:02.000
 It's really useful in the current environment of the genome,

1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:04.920
 which is moving from human to human.

1:48:04.920 --> 1:48:06.840
 When it was moving from bat to bat,

1:48:06.840 --> 1:48:08.680
 it couldn't care less for that mutation,

1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:09.960
 but it's environment specific.

1:48:09.960 --> 1:48:12.560
 So now that it's moving from human to human,

1:48:12.560 --> 1:48:15.920
 it's moving way better, like by orders of magnitude.

1:48:15.920 --> 1:48:18.440
 What do you, okay, so you're like tracking

1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:22.520
 this evolutionary dynamics, which is fascinating,

1:48:22.520 --> 1:48:24.200
 but what do you do with that?

1:48:24.200 --> 1:48:25.320
 So what does that mean?

1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:27.560
 What does this mean, what do you make,

1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:29.120
 what do you make of this mutation

1:48:29.120 --> 1:48:31.560
 in trying to anticipate, I guess,

1:48:31.560 --> 1:48:34.120
 is one of the things you're trying to do

1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:37.840
 is anticipate where, how this unrolls into the future,

1:48:37.840 --> 1:48:39.760
 this evolutionary dynamics.

1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:40.640
 Such a great question.

1:48:40.640 --> 1:48:42.880
 So there's two things.

1:48:42.880 --> 1:48:44.680
 Remember when I was saying earlier,

1:48:44.680 --> 1:48:47.040
 mutation is the path to new things,

1:48:47.040 --> 1:48:49.720
 but also the path to break old things.

1:48:49.720 --> 1:48:52.960
 So what we know is that this position

1:48:52.960 --> 1:48:56.600
 was extremely preserved through gazillions of mutations.

1:48:56.600 --> 1:48:58.440
 That mutation was never tolerated

1:48:58.440 --> 1:49:00.200
 when it was moving from bats to bats.

1:49:00.200 --> 1:49:02.480
 So that basically means that that position

1:49:02.480 --> 1:49:05.600
 is extremely important in the function of that protein.

1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:06.920
 That's the first thing it tells.

1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:09.280
 The second one is that that position

1:49:09.280 --> 1:49:12.360
 was very well suited to bat transmission,

1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:14.720
 but now is not well suited to human transmission,

1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:15.840
 so it got rid of it.

1:49:15.840 --> 1:49:18.840
 And it now has a new version of that amino acid

1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:20.920
 that basically makes it much easier

1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:22.720
 to transmit from human to human.

1:49:22.720 --> 1:49:27.440
 So in terms of the evolutionary history

1:49:27.440 --> 1:49:29.800
 teaching us about the future,

1:49:29.800 --> 1:49:31.960
 it basically tells us here's the regions

1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:34.760
 that are currently mutating.

1:49:34.760 --> 1:49:36.400
 Here's the regions that are most likely

1:49:36.400 --> 1:49:37.880
 to mutate going forward.

1:49:37.880 --> 1:49:39.440
 As you're building a vaccine,

1:49:39.440 --> 1:49:41.680
 here's what you should be focusing on

1:49:41.680 --> 1:49:43.520
 in terms of the most stable regions

1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:45.440
 that are the least likely to mutate.

1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:48.200
 Or here's the newly evolved functions

1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:50.240
 that are the most likely to be important

1:49:50.240 --> 1:49:54.560
 because they've overcome this local maximum

1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:59.360
 that it had reached in the bat transmission.

1:49:59.360 --> 1:50:01.760
 So anyway, it's a tangent to basically say

1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:04.080
 that evolution works in messy ways.

1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:06.320
 And the thing that you would break

1:50:07.400 --> 1:50:10.320
 is the thing that actually allows you

1:50:10.320 --> 1:50:12.160
 to first go through a lull

1:50:12.160 --> 1:50:15.200
 and then reaching new local maximum.

1:50:15.200 --> 1:50:18.920
 And I often like to say that if engineers

1:50:18.920 --> 1:50:21.200
 had basically designed evolution,

1:50:21.200 --> 1:50:24.520
 we would still be perfectly replicating bacteria

1:50:26.640 --> 1:50:29.400
 because it's my making the bacterium worse

1:50:29.400 --> 1:50:32.200
 that you allow evolution to reach a new optimum.

1:50:32.200 --> 1:50:34.520
 That's, just to pause on that,

1:50:34.520 --> 1:50:35.840
 that's so profound.

1:50:35.840 --> 1:50:39.400
 That's so profound for the entirety

1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:43.720
 of this scientific and engineering disciplines.

1:50:44.680 --> 1:50:45.520
 Exactly.

1:50:45.520 --> 1:50:48.520
 We as engineers need to embrace breaking things.

1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:50.960
 We as engineers need to embrace robustness

1:50:50.960 --> 1:50:54.240
 as the first principle beyond perfection

1:50:54.240 --> 1:50:56.040
 because nothing's gonna ever be perfect.

1:50:56.040 --> 1:50:58.440
 And when you're sending a satellite to Mars,

1:50:58.440 --> 1:51:01.160
 when something goes wrong, it'll break down.

1:51:01.160 --> 1:51:04.600
 As opposed to building systems that tolerate failure

1:51:04.600 --> 1:51:08.840
 and are resilient to that.

1:51:08.840 --> 1:51:11.080
 And in fact, get better through that.

1:51:11.080 --> 1:51:14.400
 So the SpaceX approach versus NASA for the...

1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:16.200
 For example.

1:51:16.200 --> 1:51:21.320
 Is there something we can learn about the incredible,

1:51:21.320 --> 1:51:23.960
 take lessons from the incredible biological systems

1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:27.600
 in their resilience, in the mushiness, the messiness

1:51:27.600 --> 1:51:31.880
 to our computing systems, to our computers?

1:51:31.880 --> 1:51:35.280
 It would basically be starting from scratch in many ways.

1:51:35.280 --> 1:51:38.960
 It would basically be building new paradigms

1:51:38.960 --> 1:51:42.760
 that don't try to get the right answer all the time,

1:51:42.760 --> 1:51:45.600
 but try to get the right answer most of the time

1:51:45.600 --> 1:51:47.000
 or a lot of the time.

1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:49.280
 Do you see deep learning systems in the whole world

1:51:49.280 --> 1:51:51.120
 of machine learning as kind of taking a step

1:51:51.120 --> 1:51:52.000
 in that direction?

1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:53.600
 Absolutely, absolutely.

1:51:53.600 --> 1:51:57.560
 Basically by allowing this much more natural evolution

1:51:57.560 --> 1:52:01.080
 of these parameters, you basically...

1:52:01.080 --> 1:52:04.000
 And if you look at sort of deep learning systems again,

1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:07.440
 they're not inspired by the genome aspect of biology,

1:52:07.440 --> 1:52:10.160
 they're inspired by the brain aspect of biology.

1:52:10.160 --> 1:52:12.560
 And again, I want you to pause for a second

1:52:12.560 --> 1:52:17.560
 and realize the complexity of the entire human brain

1:52:18.720 --> 1:52:22.760
 with trillions of connections within our neurons,

1:52:22.760 --> 1:52:26.640
 with millions of cells talking to each other,

1:52:26.640 --> 1:52:29.040
 is still encoded within that same genome.

1:52:29.040 --> 1:52:34.040
 That same genome encodes every single freaking cell type

1:52:36.080 --> 1:52:37.920
 of the entire body.

1:52:37.920 --> 1:52:41.040
 Every single cell is encoded by the same code.

1:52:41.040 --> 1:52:45.240
 And yet specialization allows you to have

1:52:45.240 --> 1:52:50.040
 the single viral like genome that self replicates,

1:52:50.040 --> 1:52:54.200
 the single module, modular automaton,

1:52:54.200 --> 1:52:57.360
 work with other copies of itself, it's mind boggling.

1:52:57.360 --> 1:53:01.600
 Create complex organs through which blood flows.

1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:02.680
 And what is that blood?

1:53:02.680 --> 1:53:04.120
 The same freaking genome.

1:53:05.560 --> 1:53:09.840
 Create organs that communicate with each other.

1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:11.080
 And what are these organs?

1:53:11.080 --> 1:53:13.120
 The exact same genome.

1:53:13.120 --> 1:53:17.560
 Create a brain that is innervated by massive amounts

1:53:17.560 --> 1:53:21.240
 of blood pumping energy to it,

1:53:21.240 --> 1:53:28.240
 20% of our energetic needs to the brain from the same genome.

1:53:28.240 --> 1:53:30.120
 And all of the neuronal connections,

1:53:30.120 --> 1:53:33.920
 all of the auxiliary cells, all of the immune cells,

1:53:33.920 --> 1:53:35.920
 the astrocytes, the ligodendrocytes, the neurons,

1:53:35.920 --> 1:53:37.360
 the excitatory, the inhibitory neurons,

1:53:37.360 --> 1:53:39.480
 all of the different classes of parasites,

1:53:39.480 --> 1:53:42.880
 the blood brain barrier, all of that, same genome.

1:53:42.880 --> 1:53:47.680
 One way to see that in a sad, this one is beautiful.

1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:50.800
 The sad thing is thinking about the trillions

1:53:50.800 --> 1:53:55.240
 of organisms that died to create that.

1:53:55.240 --> 1:53:57.080
 You mean on the evolutionary path to humans?

1:53:57.080 --> 1:53:59.600
 On the evolutionary path to humans.

1:53:59.600 --> 1:54:02.680
 It's crazy, there's two descendant of apes

1:54:02.680 --> 1:54:04.760
 just talking on a podcast.

1:54:04.760 --> 1:54:08.520
 Okay, it's just so mind boggling.

1:54:08.520 --> 1:54:11.120
 Just to boggle our minds a little bit more.

1:54:11.120 --> 1:54:12.520
 Us talking to each other,

1:54:13.920 --> 1:54:18.440
 we are basically generating a series of vocal utterances

1:54:18.440 --> 1:54:23.440
 through our pulsating of vocal cords received through this.

1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:26.160
 The people who listen to this

1:54:26.160 --> 1:54:29.240
 are taking a completely different path

1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:32.880
 to that information transfer, yet through language.

1:54:32.880 --> 1:54:36.160
 But imagine if we could connect these brains

1:54:36.160 --> 1:54:37.520
 directly to each other.

1:54:38.920 --> 1:54:41.600
 The amount of information that I'm condensing

1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:46.360
 into a small number of words is a huge funnel,

1:54:46.360 --> 1:54:49.480
 which then you receive and you expand

1:54:49.480 --> 1:54:52.840
 into a huge number of thoughts from that small funnel.

1:54:55.760 --> 1:54:58.080
 In many ways, engineers would love

1:54:58.080 --> 1:54:59.880
 to have the whole information transfer,

1:54:59.880 --> 1:55:02.640
 just take the whole set of neurons and throw them away.

1:55:02.640 --> 1:55:05.440
 I mean, throw them to the other person.

1:55:05.440 --> 1:55:07.280
 This might actually not be better

1:55:07.280 --> 1:55:10.640
 because in your misinterpretation

1:55:10.640 --> 1:55:13.000
 of every word that I'm saying,

1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:14.680
 you are creating new interpretation

1:55:14.680 --> 1:55:16.080
 that might actually be way better

1:55:16.080 --> 1:55:17.920
 than what I meant in the first place.

1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:21.760
 The ambiguity of language perhaps

1:55:21.760 --> 1:55:25.000
 might be the secret to creativity.

1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:28.400
 Every single time you work on a project by yourself,

1:55:28.400 --> 1:55:31.120
 you only bounce ideas with one person

1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:33.760
 and your neurons are basically fully cognizant

1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:35.880
 of what these ideas are.

1:55:35.880 --> 1:55:37.720
 But the moment you interact with another person,

1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:41.080
 the misinterpretations that happen

1:55:41.080 --> 1:55:43.760
 might be the most creative part of the process.

1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:45.600
 With my students, every time we have a research meeting,

1:55:45.600 --> 1:55:47.560
 I very often pause and say,

1:55:47.560 --> 1:55:50.400
 let me repeat what you just said in a different way.

1:55:50.400 --> 1:55:52.400
 And I sort of go on and brainstorm

1:55:52.400 --> 1:55:53.680
 with what they were saying,

1:55:53.680 --> 1:55:55.960
 but by the third time,

1:55:55.960 --> 1:55:58.000
 it's not what they were saying at all.

1:55:58.000 --> 1:55:59.480
 And when they pick up what I'm saying,

1:55:59.480 --> 1:56:01.160
 they're like, oh, well, dah, dah, dah.

1:56:01.160 --> 1:56:04.160
 Now they've sort of learned something very different

1:56:04.160 --> 1:56:05.000
 from what I was saying.

1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:08.480
 And that is the same kind of messiness

1:56:08.480 --> 1:56:10.960
 that I'm describing in the genome itself.

1:56:10.960 --> 1:56:13.600
 It's sort of embracing the messiness.

1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:15.400
 And that's a feature, not a book.

1:56:15.400 --> 1:56:16.240
 Exactly.

1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:17.560
 And in the same way, when you're thinking

1:56:17.560 --> 1:56:19.960
 about sort of these deep learning systems

1:56:19.960 --> 1:56:23.600
 that will allow us to sort of be more creative perhaps

1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:27.560
 or learn better approximations of these complex functions,

1:56:27.560 --> 1:56:29.800
 again, tuned to the universe that we inhabit,

1:56:30.720 --> 1:56:33.680
 you have to embrace the breaking.

1:56:33.680 --> 1:56:35.400
 You have to embrace the,

1:56:35.400 --> 1:56:38.000
 how do we get out of these local optima?

1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.960
 And a lot of the design paradigms

1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:43.400
 that have made deep learning so successful

1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:45.400
 are ways to get away from that,

1:56:45.400 --> 1:56:47.360
 ways to get better training

1:56:47.360 --> 1:56:50.520
 by sort of sending long range messages,

1:56:50.520 --> 1:56:55.520
 these LSTM models and the sort of feed forward loops

1:56:55.920 --> 1:56:59.280
 that sort of jump through layers

1:56:59.280 --> 1:57:00.920
 of a convolutional neural network.

1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:04.960
 All of these things are basically ways to push you out

1:57:04.960 --> 1:57:06.400
 of these local maxima.

1:57:07.360 --> 1:57:08.840
 And that's sort of what evolution does.

1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:09.840
 That's what language does.

1:57:09.840 --> 1:57:12.360
 That's what conversation and brainstorming does.

1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:14.120
 That's what our brain does.

1:57:14.120 --> 1:57:18.320
 So this design paradigm is something that's pervasive

1:57:18.320 --> 1:57:20.560
 and yet not taught in schools,

1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:22.280
 not taught in engineering schools

1:57:22.280 --> 1:57:24.520
 where everything's minutely modularized

1:57:24.520 --> 1:57:26.040
 to make sure that we never deviate

1:57:26.040 --> 1:57:28.640
 from whatever signal we're trying to emit

1:57:28.640 --> 1:57:31.440
 as opposed to let all hell breaks loose

1:57:31.440 --> 1:57:34.000
 because that's the path to paradise.

1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:35.440
 The path to paradise.

1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:38.040
 Yeah, I mean, it's difficult to know how to teach that

1:57:38.040 --> 1:57:39.320
 and what to do with it.

1:57:39.320 --> 1:57:43.680
 I mean, it's difficult to know how to build up

1:57:43.680 --> 1:57:46.640
 the scientific method around messiness.

1:57:46.640 --> 1:57:49.960
 I mean, it's not all messiness.

1:57:49.960 --> 1:57:51.960
 We need some cleanness.

1:57:51.960 --> 1:57:54.400
 And going back to the example with Mars,

1:57:54.400 --> 1:57:55.520
 that's probably the place where I want

1:57:55.520 --> 1:57:58.800
 to sort of moderate error as much as possible

1:57:58.800 --> 1:58:01.080
 and sort of control the environment as much as possible.

1:58:01.080 --> 1:58:03.160
 But if you're trying to repopulate Mars,

1:58:03.160 --> 1:58:05.320
 well, maybe messiness is a good thing then.

1:58:05.320 --> 1:58:09.280
 On that, you quickly mentioned this

1:58:09.280 --> 1:58:12.920
 in terms of us using our vocal cords

1:58:12.920 --> 1:58:15.120
 to speak on a podcast.

1:58:15.120 --> 1:58:17.800
 So Elon Musk and Neuralink are working

1:58:17.800 --> 1:58:22.680
 on trying to plug, as per our discussion

1:58:22.680 --> 1:58:24.920
 with computers and biological systems,

1:58:24.920 --> 1:58:25.840
 to connect the two.

1:58:25.840 --> 1:58:30.640
 He's trying to connect our brain to a computer

1:58:30.640 --> 1:58:32.840
 to create a brain computer interface

1:58:32.840 --> 1:58:36.160
 where they can communicate back and forth.

1:58:36.160 --> 1:58:40.960
 On this line of thinking, do you think this is possible

1:58:40.960 --> 1:58:45.200
 to bridge the gap between our engineered computing systems

1:58:45.200 --> 1:58:48.240
 and the messy biological systems?

1:58:49.280 --> 1:58:51.920
 My answer would be absolutely.

1:58:51.920 --> 1:58:54.440
 You know, there's no doubt that we can understand

1:58:54.440 --> 1:58:57.120
 more and more about what goes on in the brain

1:58:57.120 --> 1:59:00.520
 and we can sort of train the brain.

1:59:00.520 --> 1:59:03.600
 I don't know if you remember the Palm Pilot.

1:59:03.600 --> 1:59:04.720
 Yeah, Palm Pilot, yeah.

1:59:04.720 --> 1:59:08.440
 Remember this whole sort of alphabet that they had created?

1:59:08.440 --> 1:59:10.920
 Am I thinking of the same thing?

1:59:10.920 --> 1:59:13.280
 It's basically, you had a little pen

1:59:13.280 --> 1:59:17.000
 and for every character, you had a little scribble

1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:19.800
 that was unique that the machine could understand.

1:59:19.800 --> 1:59:22.520
 And that instead of trying the machine

1:59:22.520 --> 1:59:23.640
 and trying to teach the machine

1:59:23.640 --> 1:59:25.200
 to recognize human characters,

1:59:25.200 --> 1:59:27.200
 you had basically, they figured out

1:59:27.200 --> 1:59:29.960
 that it's better and easier to train humans

1:59:29.960 --> 1:59:31.840
 to create human like characters

1:59:31.840 --> 1:59:34.760
 that the machine is better at recognizing.

1:59:34.760 --> 1:59:38.320
 So in the same way, I think what will happen

1:59:38.320 --> 1:59:40.600
 is that humans will be trained

1:59:40.600 --> 1:59:43.200
 to be able to create the mind pattern

1:59:43.200 --> 1:59:45.160
 that the machine will respond to

1:59:45.160 --> 1:59:47.760
 before the machine truly comprehends our thoughts.

1:59:47.760 --> 1:59:50.160
 So the first human brain interfaces

1:59:50.160 --> 1:59:53.640
 will be tricking humans to speak the machine language

1:59:53.640 --> 1:59:55.640
 where with the right set of electrodes,

1:59:55.640 --> 1:59:57.640
 I can sort of trick my brain into doing this.

1:59:57.640 --> 2:00:00.240
 And this is the same way that many people teach,

2:00:00.240 --> 2:00:02.960
 like learn to control artificial limbs.

2:00:02.960 --> 2:00:04.520
 You basically try a bunch of stuff

2:00:04.520 --> 2:00:06.880
 and eventually you figure out how your limbs work.

2:00:06.880 --> 2:00:08.200
 That might not be very different

2:00:08.200 --> 2:00:11.480
 from how humans learn to use their natural limbs

2:00:11.480 --> 2:00:13.080
 when they first grow up.

2:00:13.080 --> 2:00:14.920
 Basically, you have these, you know,

2:00:14.920 --> 2:00:17.960
 neoteny period of, you know,

2:00:17.960 --> 2:00:21.320
 this puddle of soup inside your brain,

2:00:21.320 --> 2:00:23.840
 trying to figure out how to even make neural connections

2:00:23.840 --> 2:00:27.280
 before you're born and then learning sounds

2:00:27.280 --> 2:00:31.480
 in utero of, you know, all kinds of echoes

2:00:31.480 --> 2:00:35.840
 and, you know, eventually getting out in the real world.

2:00:35.840 --> 2:00:37.280
 And I don't know if you've seen newborns,

2:00:37.280 --> 2:00:39.840
 but they just stare around a lot.

2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:41.680
 You know, one way to think about this

2:00:41.680 --> 2:00:43.000
 as a machine learning person is,

2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:46.080
 oh, they're just training their edge detectors.

2:00:46.080 --> 2:00:47.320
 And eventually they figure out

2:00:47.320 --> 2:00:48.680
 how to train their edge detectors.

2:00:48.680 --> 2:00:50.800
 They work through the second layer of the visual cortex

2:00:50.800 --> 2:00:52.640
 and the third layer and so on and so forth.

2:00:52.640 --> 2:00:57.640
 And you basically have this learning

2:00:58.320 --> 2:00:59.360
 how to control your limbs

2:00:59.360 --> 2:01:01.000
 that probably comes at the same time.

2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:03.280
 You're sort of, you know, throwing random things there

2:01:03.280 --> 2:01:04.720
 and you realize that, oh, wow,

2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:07.120
 when I do this thing, my limb moves.

2:01:08.200 --> 2:01:09.240
 Let's do the following experiment.

2:01:09.240 --> 2:01:10.080
 Take a breath.

2:01:11.880 --> 2:01:13.480
 What muscles did you flex?

2:01:13.480 --> 2:01:16.600
 Now take another breath and think what muscles do I flex?

2:01:16.600 --> 2:01:17.920
 The first thing that you're thinking

2:01:17.920 --> 2:01:19.840
 when you're taking a breath

2:01:19.840 --> 2:01:22.320
 is the impact that it has on your lungs.

2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:24.080
 You're like, oh, I'm now gonna increase my lungs

2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:25.440
 or I'm not gonna bring air in.

2:01:25.440 --> 2:01:26.360
 But what you're actually doing

2:01:26.360 --> 2:01:27.960
 is just changing your diaphragm.

2:01:29.160 --> 2:01:31.880
 That's not conscious, of course.

2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:34.920
 You never think of the diaphragm as a thing.

2:01:34.920 --> 2:01:36.000
 And why is that?

2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:37.360
 That's probably the same reason

2:01:37.360 --> 2:01:38.800
 why I think of moving my finger

2:01:38.800 --> 2:01:40.520
 when I actually move my finger.

2:01:40.520 --> 2:01:42.520
 I think of the effect instead of actually thinking

2:01:42.520 --> 2:01:44.080
 of whatever muscle is twitching

2:01:44.080 --> 2:01:46.440
 that actually causes my finger to move.

2:01:46.440 --> 2:01:49.240
 So we basically in our first years of life

2:01:49.240 --> 2:01:52.360
 build up this massive lookup table

2:01:52.360 --> 2:01:55.400
 between whatever neuronal firing we do

2:01:55.400 --> 2:02:00.400
 and whatever action happens in our body that we control.

2:02:00.880 --> 2:02:03.160
 If you have a kid grow up with a third limb,

2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:06.600
 I'm sure they'll figure out how to control them

2:02:06.600 --> 2:02:09.440
 probably at the same rate as their natural limbs.

2:02:09.440 --> 2:02:13.320
 And a lot of the work would be done by the...

2:02:13.320 --> 2:02:15.520
 If a third limb is a computer,

2:02:15.520 --> 2:02:20.440
 you kind of have a, not a faith, but a thought

2:02:20.440 --> 2:02:24.360
 that the brain might be able to figure out...

2:02:24.360 --> 2:02:26.840
 The plasticity would come from the brain.

2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:28.960
 The brain would be cleverer than the machine at first.

2:02:28.960 --> 2:02:29.960
 When I talk about a third limb,

2:02:29.960 --> 2:02:32.240
 that's exactly what I'm saying, an artificial limb

2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:35.640
 that basically just controls your mouse while you're typing.

2:02:35.640 --> 2:02:36.600
 Perfectly natural thing.

2:02:36.600 --> 2:02:39.000
 I mean, again, in a few hundred years.

2:02:40.320 --> 2:02:41.600
 Maybe sooner than that.

2:02:41.600 --> 2:02:46.040
 But basically, as long as the machine is consistent

2:02:46.040 --> 2:02:49.760
 in the way that it will respond to your brain impulses,

2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:51.680
 you'll figure out how to control that

2:02:51.680 --> 2:02:53.920
 and you could play tennis with your third limb.

2:02:53.920 --> 2:02:57.480
 And let me go back to consistency.

2:02:57.480 --> 2:03:01.280
 People who have dramatic accidents

2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:03.920
 that basically take out a whole chunk of their brain

2:03:03.920 --> 2:03:07.000
 can be taught to coopt other parts of the brain

2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:08.560
 to then control that part.

2:03:08.560 --> 2:03:10.840
 You can basically build up that tissue again

2:03:10.840 --> 2:03:13.480
 and eventually train your body how to walk again

2:03:13.480 --> 2:03:15.400
 and how to read again and how to play again

2:03:15.400 --> 2:03:17.160
 and how to think again, how to speak a language again,

2:03:17.160 --> 2:03:18.080
 et cetera.

2:03:18.080 --> 2:03:21.280
 So there's a massive amount of malleability

2:03:21.280 --> 2:03:26.280
 that happens naturally in our way of controlling our body,

2:03:26.600 --> 2:03:29.720
 our brain, our thoughts, our vocal cords, our limbs,

2:03:29.720 --> 2:03:30.760
 et cetera.

2:03:30.760 --> 2:03:35.640
 And human machine interfaces are inevitable

2:03:35.640 --> 2:03:39.240
 if we sort of figure out how to read these electric impulses,

2:03:39.240 --> 2:03:43.400
 but the resolution at which we can understand human thought

2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:46.560
 right now is nil, is ridiculous.

2:03:46.560 --> 2:03:49.120
 So how are human thoughts encoded?

2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:53.560
 It's basically combinations of neurons that cofire

2:03:53.560 --> 2:03:55.720
 and these create these things called engrams

2:03:55.720 --> 2:03:58.920
 that eventually form memories and so on and so forth.

2:03:58.920 --> 2:04:01.920
 We know nothing of all that stuff.

2:04:01.920 --> 2:04:05.600
 So before we can actually read into your brain

2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:06.680
 that you wanna build a program

2:04:06.680 --> 2:04:08.920
 that does this and this and this and that,

2:04:08.920 --> 2:04:10.960
 we need a lot of neuroscience.

2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:13.480
 Well, so to push back on that,

2:04:13.480 --> 2:04:16.680
 do you think it's possible that without understanding

2:04:16.680 --> 2:04:20.000
 the functionally about the brain or from the neuroscience

2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:22.080
 or the cognitive science or psychology,

2:04:22.080 --> 2:04:24.220
 whichever level of the brain we'll look at,

2:04:24.220 --> 2:04:26.700
 do you think if we just connect them,

2:04:26.700 --> 2:04:29.200
 just like per your previous point,

2:04:29.200 --> 2:04:30.840
 if we just have a high enough resolution

2:04:30.840 --> 2:04:34.400
 between connection between a Wikipedia and your brain,

2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:38.160
 the brain will just figure it out with us understanding

2:04:38.160 --> 2:04:40.320
 because that's one of the innovations of Neuralink

2:04:40.320 --> 2:04:43.540
 is they're increasing the number of connections

2:04:43.540 --> 2:04:45.320
 to the brain to like several thousand,

2:04:45.320 --> 2:04:48.280
 which before was in the dozens or whatever.

2:04:48.280 --> 2:04:51.000
 You're still off by a few orders of magnitude

2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:52.160
 on the order of seven.

2:04:52.160 --> 2:04:57.160
 Right, but the thing is, the hope is if you increase

2:04:57.480 --> 2:04:58.800
 that number more and more and more,

2:04:58.800 --> 2:05:00.600
 maybe you don't need to understand anything

2:05:00.600 --> 2:05:03.780
 about the actual how human thought

2:05:03.780 --> 2:05:04.960
 is represented in the brain.

2:05:04.960 --> 2:05:08.520
 You can just let it figure it out by itself.

2:05:08.520 --> 2:05:10.680
 Keanu Reeves waking up and saying, I know cook food.

2:05:10.680 --> 2:05:11.520
 Yeah, exactly.

2:05:13.160 --> 2:05:14.600
 So yeah, sure.

2:05:14.600 --> 2:05:16.720
 You don't have faith in the plasticity of the brain

2:05:16.720 --> 2:05:18.240
 to that degree.

2:05:18.240 --> 2:05:19.840
 It's not about brain plasticity.

2:05:19.840 --> 2:05:21.880
 It's about the input aspect.

2:05:21.880 --> 2:05:23.720
 Basically, I think on the output aspect,

2:05:23.720 --> 2:05:25.440
 being able to control a machine is something

2:05:25.440 --> 2:05:28.440
 that you can probably train your neural impulses

2:05:28.440 --> 2:05:30.940
 that you're sending out to sort of match

2:05:30.940 --> 2:05:33.280
 whatever response you see in the environment.

2:05:33.280 --> 2:05:35.600
 If this thing moved every single time I thought

2:05:35.600 --> 2:05:37.340
 a particular thought, then I could figure out,

2:05:37.340 --> 2:05:39.520
 I could hack my way into moving this thing

2:05:39.520 --> 2:05:40.960
 with just a series of thoughts.

2:05:40.960 --> 2:05:44.640
 I could think guitar, piano, tennis ball,

2:05:45.880 --> 2:05:47.120
 and then this thing would be moving.

2:05:47.120 --> 2:05:50.640
 And then I would just have the series of thoughts

2:05:50.640 --> 2:05:52.640
 that would sort of result in the impulses

2:05:52.640 --> 2:05:54.040
 that will move this thing the way that I want it.

2:05:54.040 --> 2:05:55.560
 And then eventually it'll become natural

2:05:55.560 --> 2:05:57.640
 because I won't even think about it.

2:05:57.640 --> 2:05:59.120
 I mean, in the same way that we control our limbs

2:05:59.120 --> 2:06:01.360
 in a very natural way, but babies don't do that.

2:06:01.360 --> 2:06:03.160
 Babies have to figure it out.

2:06:03.160 --> 2:06:04.840
 And some of that is hard coded,

2:06:04.840 --> 2:06:06.800
 but some of that is actually learned

2:06:06.800 --> 2:06:10.320
 based on whatever soup of neurons you ended up with,

2:06:10.320 --> 2:06:13.440
 whatever connections you pruned them to,

2:06:13.440 --> 2:06:15.360
 and eventually you were born with.

2:06:15.360 --> 2:06:17.740
 A lot of that is coded in the genome,

2:06:17.740 --> 2:06:19.680
 but a huge chunk of that is stochastic.

2:06:19.680 --> 2:06:21.320
 And sort of the way that you sort of create

2:06:21.320 --> 2:06:23.440
 all these neurons, they migrate, they form connections,

2:06:23.440 --> 2:06:25.140
 they sort of spread out,

2:06:25.140 --> 2:06:26.520
 they have particular branching patterns,

2:06:26.520 --> 2:06:28.200
 but then the connectivity itself,

2:06:28.200 --> 2:06:30.120
 unique in every single new person.

2:06:30.120 --> 2:06:34.000
 All this to say that on the output side,

2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:36.920
 absolutely, I'm very, very, you know,

2:06:36.920 --> 2:06:38.640
 hopeful that we can have machines

2:06:38.640 --> 2:06:41.920
 that read thousands of these neuronal connections

2:06:41.920 --> 2:06:45.580
 on the output side, but on the input side, oh boy.

2:06:47.960 --> 2:06:51.240
 I don't expect any time in the near future

2:06:51.240 --> 2:06:53.400
 we'll be able to sort of send a series of impulses

2:06:53.400 --> 2:06:56.280
 that will tell me, oh, earth to sun distance,

2:06:56.280 --> 2:06:58.960
 7.5 million, et cetera, et cetera.

2:06:58.960 --> 2:07:00.720
 Like nowhere.

2:07:00.720 --> 2:07:04.480
 I mean, I think language will still be the input way

2:07:04.480 --> 2:07:07.360
 rather than sort of any kind of more complex.

2:07:07.360 --> 2:07:08.760
 It's a really interesting notion

2:07:08.760 --> 2:07:12.600
 that the ambiguity of language is a feature.

2:07:12.600 --> 2:07:16.520
 And we evolved for millions of years

2:07:16.520 --> 2:07:19.520
 to take advantage of that ambiguity.

2:07:19.520 --> 2:07:20.520
 Exactly.

2:07:20.520 --> 2:07:23.380
 And yet no one teaches us the subtle differences

2:07:23.380 --> 2:07:26.080
 between words that are near cognates,

2:07:26.080 --> 2:07:29.320
 and yet evoke so much more than, you know,

2:07:29.320 --> 2:07:30.760
 one from the other.

2:07:30.760 --> 2:07:34.520
 And yet, you know, when you're choosing words

2:07:34.520 --> 2:07:36.840
 from a list of 20 synonyms,

2:07:36.840 --> 2:07:38.400
 you know exactly the connotation

2:07:38.400 --> 2:07:40.040
 of every single one of them.

2:07:40.040 --> 2:07:42.600
 And that's something that, you know, is there.

2:07:42.600 --> 2:07:45.120
 So yes, there's ambiguity,

2:07:45.120 --> 2:07:46.800
 but there's all kinds of connotations.

2:07:46.800 --> 2:07:48.880
 And in the way that we select our words,

2:07:48.880 --> 2:07:51.320
 we have so much baggage that we're sending along,

2:07:51.320 --> 2:07:52.960
 the way that we're emoting,

2:07:52.960 --> 2:07:54.720
 the way that we're moving our hands

2:07:54.720 --> 2:07:56.080
 every single time we speak,

2:07:56.080 --> 2:07:58.880
 the, you know, the pauses, the eye contact, et cetera.

2:07:58.880 --> 2:08:01.800
 So much higher baud rate than just a vocal,

2:08:01.800 --> 2:08:04.040
 you know, string of characters.

2:08:04.040 --> 2:08:07.120
 Well, let me just take a small tangent on that.

2:08:07.120 --> 2:08:07.960
 Oh, tangent?

2:08:07.960 --> 2:08:08.800
 We haven't done that yet.

2:08:08.800 --> 2:08:09.640
 It's a good idea.

2:08:09.640 --> 2:08:10.480
 Let's do a tangent.

2:08:10.480 --> 2:08:14.080
 We'll return to the origin of life after.

2:08:16.200 --> 2:08:17.840
 So, I mean, you're Greek,

2:08:17.840 --> 2:08:20.880
 but I'm going on this personal journey.

2:08:20.880 --> 2:08:25.120
 I'm going to Paris for the explicit purpose

2:08:25.120 --> 2:08:29.360
 of talking to one of the most famous,

2:08:29.360 --> 2:08:33.200
 a couple who's a famous translators of Russian literature,

2:08:33.200 --> 2:08:36.280
 Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and they go,

2:08:36.280 --> 2:08:38.440
 that's their art is the translation.

2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:43.440
 And everything I've learned about the translation art,

2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:46.120
 it makes me feel,

2:08:46.120 --> 2:08:51.120
 it's so profound in a way that's so much more profound

2:08:53.240 --> 2:08:55.400
 than the natural language processing papers

2:08:55.400 --> 2:08:57.440
 I read in the machine learning community,

2:08:57.440 --> 2:09:00.440
 that there's such depth to language

2:09:00.440 --> 2:09:03.160
 that I don't know what to do with.

2:09:03.160 --> 2:09:05.720
 I don't know if you've experienced that in your own life

2:09:05.720 --> 2:09:08.760
 with knowing multiple languages.

2:09:08.760 --> 2:09:09.840
 I don't know what to,

2:09:09.840 --> 2:09:11.680
 I don't know how to make sense of it,

2:09:11.680 --> 2:09:13.600
 but there's so much loss in translation

2:09:13.600 --> 2:09:15.320
 between Russian and English,

2:09:15.320 --> 2:09:17.440
 and getting a sense of that.

2:09:17.440 --> 2:09:18.480
 Like, for example,

2:09:19.640 --> 2:09:22.000
 there's like just taking a single sentence

2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:25.440
 from Dostoevsky, and like, there's a lot of them.

2:09:25.440 --> 2:09:27.160
 You could talk for hours

2:09:27.160 --> 2:09:30.120
 about how to translate that sentence properly.

2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:34.360
 That captures the meaning, the period,

2:09:34.360 --> 2:09:36.560
 the culture, the humor, the wit,

2:09:36.560 --> 2:09:39.760
 the suffering that was in the context of the time,

2:09:39.760 --> 2:09:42.280
 all of that could be a single sentence.

2:09:42.280 --> 2:09:46.120
 You could talk forever about what it takes

2:09:46.120 --> 2:09:47.160
 to translate that correctly.

2:09:47.160 --> 2:09:48.720
 I don't know what to do with that.

2:09:48.720 --> 2:09:51.640
 So being Greek, it's very hard for me

2:09:51.640 --> 2:09:54.480
 to think of a sentence or even a word

2:09:54.480 --> 2:09:59.000
 without going into the full etymology of that word,

2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:04.000
 breaking up every single atom of that sentence

2:10:04.840 --> 2:10:07.080
 and every single atom of these words

2:10:07.080 --> 2:10:08.840
 and rebuilding it back up.

2:10:09.800 --> 2:10:11.200
 I have three kids.

2:10:11.200 --> 2:10:13.680
 And the way that I teach them Greek

2:10:13.680 --> 2:10:16.240
 is the same way that, you know,

2:10:16.240 --> 2:10:17.640
 the documentary I was mentioning earlier

2:10:17.640 --> 2:10:19.720
 about sort of understanding the deep roots

2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:21.920
 of all of these, you know, words.

2:10:23.880 --> 2:10:28.880
 And it's very interesting

2:10:29.120 --> 2:10:31.320
 that every single time I hear a new word

2:10:31.320 --> 2:10:33.000
 that I've never heard before,

2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:34.720
 I go and figure out the etymology of that word

2:10:34.720 --> 2:10:36.760
 because I will never appreciate that word

2:10:36.760 --> 2:10:40.160
 without understanding how it was initially formed.

2:10:40.160 --> 2:10:42.080
 Interesting, but how does that help?

2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:44.080
 Because that's not the full picture.

2:10:44.080 --> 2:10:44.920
 No, no, of course, of course.

2:10:44.920 --> 2:10:48.360
 But what I'm trying to say is that knowing the components

2:10:48.360 --> 2:10:52.280
 teaches you about the context of the formation of that word

2:10:52.280 --> 2:10:54.880
 and sort of the original usage of that word.

2:10:54.880 --> 2:10:57.360
 And then of course the word takes new meaning

2:10:57.360 --> 2:11:00.840
 as you create it, you know, from its parts.

2:11:00.840 --> 2:11:04.120
 And that meaning then gets augmented.

2:11:04.120 --> 2:11:08.160
 And two synonyms that sort of have different roots

2:11:08.160 --> 2:11:09.200
 will actually have implications

2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:11.440
 that carry a lot of that baggage

2:11:11.440 --> 2:11:14.240
 of the historical provenance of these words.

2:11:14.240 --> 2:11:16.640
 So before working on genome evolution,

2:11:16.640 --> 2:11:19.920
 my passion was evolution of language

2:11:19.920 --> 2:11:23.760
 and sort of tracing cognates across different languages

2:11:24.640 --> 2:11:27.280
 through their etymologies.

2:11:27.280 --> 2:11:30.320
 That's fascinating that there's parallels between,

2:11:30.320 --> 2:11:34.280
 I mean, the idea that there's evolutionary dynamics

2:11:34.280 --> 2:11:35.520
 to our language.

2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:40.520
 Yeah, every single word that you utter, parallels, parallels.

2:11:41.560 --> 2:11:42.680
 What does parallels mean?

2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:44.800
 Para means side by side.

2:11:44.800 --> 2:11:48.760
 Alleles from alleles, which means identical twins.

2:11:48.760 --> 2:11:49.600
 Parallels.

2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:53.200
 I mean, name any word and there's so much baggage,

2:11:53.200 --> 2:11:56.880
 so much beauty in how that word came to be

2:11:56.880 --> 2:11:58.920
 and how this word took a new meaning

2:11:58.920 --> 2:12:00.320
 than the sum of its parts.

2:12:02.240 --> 2:12:05.440
 Yeah, and there's just, there's so many different words

2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:06.280
 that are just words.

2:12:06.280 --> 2:12:08.800
 They don't have any physical grounding.

2:12:08.800 --> 2:12:10.240
 And now you take these words

2:12:10.240 --> 2:12:12.640
 and you weave them into a sentence.

2:12:13.600 --> 2:12:18.600
 The emotional invocations of that weaving are fathomless.

2:12:19.280 --> 2:12:24.280
 And all of those emotions all live in the brains of humans.

2:12:25.480 --> 2:12:27.040
 In the eye of the beholder.

2:12:28.680 --> 2:12:30.840
 No, seriously, you have to embrace this concept

2:12:30.840 --> 2:12:32.440
 of the eye of the beholder.

2:12:32.440 --> 2:12:37.440
 It's the conceptualization that nothing takes meaning

2:12:37.960 --> 2:12:39.400
 with one person creating it.

2:12:39.400 --> 2:12:42.480
 Everything takes meaning in the receiving end

2:12:42.480 --> 2:12:47.480
 and the emergent properties of these communication networks

2:12:47.760 --> 2:12:49.320
 where every single, you know,

2:12:49.320 --> 2:12:50.960
 if you look at the network of our cells

2:12:50.960 --> 2:12:52.480
 and how they're communicating with each other,

2:12:52.480 --> 2:12:54.200
 every cell has its own code.

2:12:54.200 --> 2:12:56.200
 This code is modulated by the epigenome.

2:12:56.200 --> 2:12:57.960
 This creates a bunch of different cell types.

2:12:57.960 --> 2:12:59.960
 Each cell type now has its own identity.

2:12:59.960 --> 2:13:02.200
 Yet they all have the common root of the stem cells

2:13:02.200 --> 2:13:03.680
 that sort of led to them.

2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:06.600
 Each of these identities is now communicating

2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:08.120
 with each other.

2:13:08.120 --> 2:13:11.800
 They take meaning in their interaction.

2:13:11.800 --> 2:13:13.760
 There's an emergent property that comes

2:13:13.760 --> 2:13:15.680
 from a bunch of cells being together

2:13:15.680 --> 2:13:17.920
 that is not in any one of the parts.

2:13:17.920 --> 2:13:19.320
 If you look at neurons communicating,

2:13:19.320 --> 2:13:23.360
 again, these engrams don't exist in any one neuron.

2:13:23.360 --> 2:13:26.480
 They exist in the connection and the combination of neurons.

2:13:26.480 --> 2:13:29.040
 And the meaning of the words that I'm telling you

2:13:29.040 --> 2:13:31.880
 is empty until it reaches you

2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:34.120
 and it affects you in a very different way

2:13:34.120 --> 2:13:35.440
 than it affects whoever's listening

2:13:35.440 --> 2:13:37.520
 to this conversation now.

2:13:37.520 --> 2:13:40.400
 Because of the emotional baggage that I've grown up with,

2:13:40.400 --> 2:13:43.280
 that you've grown up with, and that they've grown up with.

2:13:43.280 --> 2:13:46.800
 And that's, I think, the magic of translation.

2:13:46.800 --> 2:13:48.720
 If you start thinking of translation

2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:53.720
 as just simply capturing that emotional set of reactions

2:13:53.720 --> 2:13:57.880
 that you evoke, you need a different set of words

2:13:57.880 --> 2:14:01.240
 to evoke that same set of reactions to a French person

2:14:01.240 --> 2:14:02.760
 than to a Russian person,

2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:05.480
 because of the baggage of the culture that we grew up in.

2:14:05.480 --> 2:14:07.320
 Yeah, I mean, there's...

2:14:07.320 --> 2:14:10.440
 So basically, you shouldn't find the best word.

2:14:10.440 --> 2:14:13.120
 Sometimes it's a completely different sentence structure

2:14:13.120 --> 2:14:14.120
 that you will need,

2:14:15.160 --> 2:14:18.960
 matched to the cultural context

2:14:18.960 --> 2:14:20.560
 of the target audience that you have.

2:14:20.560 --> 2:14:22.360
 Yeah, there's a lot of different words

2:14:22.360 --> 2:14:23.800
 in the target audience that you have.

2:14:23.800 --> 2:14:26.480
 Yeah, it's, I mean, you're just...

2:14:26.480 --> 2:14:27.720
 I usually don't think about this,

2:14:27.720 --> 2:14:30.000
 but right now, there's this feeling,

2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:32.680
 as a reminder, that it's just you and I talking,

2:14:32.680 --> 2:14:35.280
 but there's several hundred thousand people

2:14:35.280 --> 2:14:36.440
 will listen to this.

2:14:36.440 --> 2:14:39.520
 There's some guy in Russia right now running,

2:14:40.840 --> 2:14:44.120
 like in Moscow, listening to us.

2:14:44.120 --> 2:14:46.680
 There's somebody in India, I guarantee you.

2:14:46.680 --> 2:14:48.680
 There's somebody in China and South America.

2:14:48.680 --> 2:14:51.240
 There's somebody in Texas,

2:14:51.240 --> 2:14:53.120
 they all have different...

2:14:53.120 --> 2:14:54.120
 Emotional baggage.

2:14:54.120 --> 2:14:56.160
 They probably got angry earlier on

2:14:56.160 --> 2:14:58.360
 about the whole discussion about coronavirus

2:14:58.360 --> 2:15:02.080
 and about some aspect of it.

2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:06.960
 Yeah, and there's that network effect that's...

2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:08.000
 It's a beautiful thing.

2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:10.880
 And this lateral transfer of information,

2:15:10.880 --> 2:15:12.920
 that's what makes the collective, quote unquote,

2:15:12.920 --> 2:15:17.920
 genome of humanity so unique from any other species.

2:15:17.920 --> 2:15:19.920
 Yeah.

2:15:19.920 --> 2:15:22.640
 So you somehow miraculously wrapped it back

2:15:22.640 --> 2:15:25.160
 to the very beginning of when we were talking

2:15:25.160 --> 2:15:27.840
 about the beauty of the human genome.

2:15:29.120 --> 2:15:31.240
 So I think this is the right time,

2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:34.880
 unless we wanna go for a six to eight hour conversation.

2:15:34.880 --> 2:15:36.000
 We're gonna have to talk again,

2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:39.120
 but I think for now, to wrap it up,

2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:41.080
 this is the right time to talk about

2:15:41.080 --> 2:15:44.960
 the biggest, most ridiculous question of all,

2:15:44.960 --> 2:15:45.900
 meaning of life.

2:15:45.900 --> 2:15:47.340
 Off mic, you mentioned to me

2:15:47.340 --> 2:15:52.340
 that you had your 42nd birthday.

2:15:52.480 --> 2:15:57.480
 42nd being a very special, absurdly special number.

2:15:58.480 --> 2:16:03.040
 And you had a kind of get together with friends

2:16:03.040 --> 2:16:04.400
 to discuss the meaning of life.

2:16:04.400 --> 2:16:05.920
 So let me ask you,

2:16:05.920 --> 2:16:09.800
 in your, as a biologist, as a computer scientist,

2:16:09.800 --> 2:16:14.640
 and as a human, what is the meaning of life?

2:16:14.640 --> 2:16:18.880
 I've been asking this question for a long time,

2:16:18.880 --> 2:16:21.160
 ever since my 42nd birthday,

2:16:21.160 --> 2:16:22.080
 but well before that,

2:16:22.080 --> 2:16:25.280
 in even planning the meaning of life symposium.

2:16:25.280 --> 2:16:29.800
 And symposium, sim means together,

2:16:29.800 --> 2:16:31.520
 posy actually means to drink together.

2:16:31.520 --> 2:16:33.560
 So symposium is actually a drinking party.

2:16:33.560 --> 2:16:36.040
 So the meaning.

2:16:36.040 --> 2:16:37.880
 Can you actually elaborate about this meaning of life

2:16:37.880 --> 2:16:39.480
 symposium that you put together?

2:16:39.480 --> 2:16:42.280
 It's like the most genius idea I've ever heard.

2:16:42.280 --> 2:16:44.640
 So 42 is obviously the answer to life,

2:16:44.640 --> 2:16:45.600
 the universe and everything,

2:16:45.600 --> 2:16:47.640
 from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

2:16:47.640 --> 2:16:49.560
 And as I was turning 42,

2:16:49.560 --> 2:16:51.800
 I've had the theme for every one of my birthdays.

2:16:51.800 --> 2:16:55.640
 When I was turning 32, it's one, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero

2:16:55.640 --> 2:16:56.640
 in binary.

2:16:56.640 --> 2:17:00.080
 So I celebrated my 100,000th binary birthday,

2:17:00.080 --> 2:17:03.640
 and I had a theme of going back 100,000 years,

2:17:03.640 --> 2:17:07.160
 let's dress something in the last 100,000 years.

2:17:07.160 --> 2:17:09.600
 Anyway, it was, I've always had these.

2:17:09.600 --> 2:17:12.320
 It's such an interesting human being.

2:17:12.320 --> 2:17:13.160
 Okay, that's awesome.

2:17:13.160 --> 2:17:16.240
 I've always had these sort of numerology

2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:20.480
 related announcements for my birthday parties.

2:17:21.800 --> 2:17:26.800
 So what came out of that meaning of life symposium

2:17:27.360 --> 2:17:29.720
 is that I basically asked 42 of my colleagues,

2:17:29.720 --> 2:17:33.080
 42 of my friends, 42 of my collaborators,

2:17:33.080 --> 2:17:35.520
 to basically give seven minutes species

2:17:35.520 --> 2:17:38.520
 on the meaning of life, each from their perspective.

2:17:38.520 --> 2:17:40.600
 And I really encourage you to go there

2:17:40.600 --> 2:17:42.560
 because it's mind boggling

2:17:42.560 --> 2:17:46.280
 that every single person said a different answer.

2:17:46.280 --> 2:17:48.480
 Every single person started with,

2:17:48.480 --> 2:17:50.920
 I don't know what the meaning of life is, but,

2:17:50.920 --> 2:17:54.240
 and then give this beautifully eloquently answer,

2:17:54.240 --> 2:17:55.440
 eloquent answer.

2:17:55.440 --> 2:17:57.320
 And they were all different,

2:17:57.320 --> 2:18:01.360
 but they all were consistent with each other

2:18:01.360 --> 2:18:04.360
 and mutually synergistic and together forming

2:18:04.360 --> 2:18:08.560
 a beautiful view of what it means to be human in many ways.

2:18:08.560 --> 2:18:12.280
 Some people talked about the loss of their loved one,

2:18:12.280 --> 2:18:14.520
 their life partner for many, many years

2:18:14.520 --> 2:18:16.520
 and how their life changed through that.

2:18:16.520 --> 2:18:19.280
 Some people talked about the origin of life.

2:18:19.280 --> 2:18:21.080
 Some people talked about the difference

2:18:21.080 --> 2:18:23.000
 between purpose and meaning.

2:18:24.160 --> 2:18:28.600
 I'll maybe quote one of the answers,

2:18:28.600 --> 2:18:30.880
 which is this linguistics professor,

2:18:30.880 --> 2:18:34.200
 friend of mine at Harvard, who basically said,

2:18:35.880 --> 2:18:37.800
 that she was gonna, she's Greek as well.

2:18:37.800 --> 2:18:40.120
 And she said, I will give a very Pythian answer.

2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:42.960
 So Pythia was the Oracle of Delphi,

2:18:42.960 --> 2:18:45.280
 who would basically give these very cryptic answers,

2:18:45.280 --> 2:18:48.320
 very short, but interpretable in many different ways.

2:18:48.320 --> 2:18:50.480
 There was this whole set of priests

2:18:50.480 --> 2:18:53.440
 who were tasked with interpreting what Pythia had said.

2:18:53.440 --> 2:18:56.440
 And very often you would not get a clean interpretation,

2:18:56.440 --> 2:18:59.000
 but she said, I will be like Pythia

2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:02.520
 and give you a very short and multiply interpretable answer.

2:19:02.520 --> 2:19:04.800
 But unlike her, I will actually also give you

2:19:04.800 --> 2:19:05.920
 three interpretations.

2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:09.800
 And she said, the answer to the meaning of life

2:19:09.800 --> 2:19:11.040
 is become one.

2:19:12.840 --> 2:19:16.320
 And the first interpretation is like a child,

2:19:16.320 --> 2:19:18.720
 become one year old with the excitement

2:19:18.720 --> 2:19:21.400
 of discovering everything about the world.

2:19:21.400 --> 2:19:25.040
 Second interpretation, in whatever you take on,

2:19:25.040 --> 2:19:28.840
 become one, the first, the best, excel,

2:19:28.840 --> 2:19:32.600
 drive yourself to perfection for every one of your tasks

2:19:32.600 --> 2:19:37.600
 and become one when people are separate,

2:19:38.480 --> 2:19:42.040
 become one, come together, learn to understand each other.

2:19:43.600 --> 2:19:45.400
 Damn, that's an answer.

2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:46.880
 And one way to summarize

2:19:46.880 --> 2:19:48.760
 this whole meaning of life symposium

2:19:48.760 --> 2:19:52.920
 is that the very symposium was illustrating

2:19:52.920 --> 2:19:54.680
 the quest for meaning,

2:19:54.680 --> 2:19:58.120
 which might itself be the meaning of life.

2:19:58.120 --> 2:20:01.400
 This constant quest for something sublime,

2:20:01.400 --> 2:20:04.880
 something human, something intangible,

2:20:04.880 --> 2:20:09.680
 some aspect of what defines us as a species

2:20:09.680 --> 2:20:11.320
 and as an individual.

2:20:11.320 --> 2:20:16.320
 Both the quest of me as a person through my own life,

2:20:16.360 --> 2:20:19.200
 but the meaning of life could also be

2:20:19.200 --> 2:20:20.840
 the meaning of all of life.

2:20:20.840 --> 2:20:22.040
 What is the whole point of life?

2:20:22.040 --> 2:20:22.880
 Why life?

2:20:22.880 --> 2:20:24.480
 Why life itself?

2:20:24.480 --> 2:20:26.720
 Because we've been talking about the history

2:20:26.720 --> 2:20:28.360
 and evolution of life,

2:20:28.360 --> 2:20:31.080
 but we haven't talked about why life in the first place?

2:20:31.080 --> 2:20:32.520
 Is life inevitable?

2:20:32.520 --> 2:20:35.880
 Is life part of physics?

2:20:35.880 --> 2:20:37.720
 Does life transcend physics

2:20:37.720 --> 2:20:40.320
 by fighting against entropy,

2:20:40.320 --> 2:20:42.960
 by compartmentalizing and increasing concentrations

2:20:42.960 --> 2:20:44.400
 rather than diluting away?

2:20:45.320 --> 2:20:50.320
 Is life a distinct entity in the universe

2:20:51.520 --> 2:20:55.080
 beyond the traditional very simple physical rules

2:20:55.080 --> 2:20:58.560
 that govern gravity and electromagnetism

2:20:58.560 --> 2:21:00.600
 and all of these forces?

2:21:00.600 --> 2:21:02.120
 Is life another force?

2:21:02.120 --> 2:21:03.120
 Is there a life force?

2:21:03.120 --> 2:21:05.920
 Is there a unique kind of set of principles that emerge,

2:21:05.920 --> 2:21:09.080
 of course, built on top of the hardware of physics,

2:21:09.080 --> 2:21:11.840
 but is it sort of a new layer of software

2:21:11.840 --> 2:21:14.400
 or a new layer of a computer system?

2:21:14.400 --> 2:21:18.480
 And so that's at the level of big questions.

2:21:18.480 --> 2:21:21.200
 There's another aspect of gratitude

2:21:21.200 --> 2:21:26.200
 of basically what I like to say is,

2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:27.920
 during this pandemic,

2:21:27.920 --> 2:21:30.800
 I've basically worked from 6 a.m. until 7 p.m.

2:21:30.800 --> 2:21:34.280
 every single day, nonstop, including Saturday and Sunday.

2:21:34.280 --> 2:21:36.440
 I've basically broken all boundaries

2:21:36.440 --> 2:21:39.120
 of where life, personal life begins

2:21:39.120 --> 2:21:42.000
 and work life ends.

2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:46.280
 And that has been exhilarating for me,

2:21:46.280 --> 2:21:50.480
 just the intellectual pleasure that I get

2:21:50.480 --> 2:21:53.840
 from a day of exhaustion,

2:21:53.840 --> 2:21:55.520
 where at the end of the day, my brain is hurting.

2:21:55.520 --> 2:21:59.320
 I'm telling my wife, wow, I was useful today.

2:22:00.360 --> 2:22:04.720
 And there's a certain pleasure

2:22:04.720 --> 2:22:08.360
 that comes from feeling useful.

2:22:08.360 --> 2:22:09.880
 And there's a certain pleasure

2:22:09.880 --> 2:22:11.600
 that comes from feeling grateful.

2:22:12.440 --> 2:22:16.440
 So I've written this little sort of prayer for my kids

2:22:16.440 --> 2:22:19.520
 to say at bedtime every night,

2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:21.000
 where they basically say,

2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:24.720
 thank you, God, for all you have given me

2:22:24.720 --> 2:22:28.560
 and give me the strength to give onto others

2:22:28.560 --> 2:22:31.200
 with the same love that you have given onto me.

2:22:33.160 --> 2:22:35.680
 We as a species are so special,

2:22:36.560 --> 2:22:39.520
 the only ones who worry about the meaning of life.

2:22:40.800 --> 2:22:43.320
 And maybe that's what makes us human.

2:22:44.680 --> 2:22:47.960
 And what I like to say to my wife and to my students

2:22:47.960 --> 2:22:52.280
 during this pandemic work extravaganza

2:22:53.280 --> 2:22:56.400
 is every now and then they ask me, but how do you do this?

2:22:56.400 --> 2:22:58.880
 And I'm like, I'm a workaholic.

2:22:58.880 --> 2:23:00.880
 I love this.

2:23:00.880 --> 2:23:04.800
 This is me in the most unfiltered way.

2:23:04.800 --> 2:23:07.280
 The ability to do something useful,

2:23:07.280 --> 2:23:09.640
 to feel that my brain is being used,

2:23:09.640 --> 2:23:12.600
 to interact with the smartest people on the planet

2:23:12.600 --> 2:23:15.880
 day in, day out, and to help them discover aspects

2:23:15.880 --> 2:23:18.520
 of the human genome, of the human brain,

2:23:18.520 --> 2:23:21.960
 of human disease and the human condition

2:23:21.960 --> 2:23:24.560
 that no one has seen before

2:23:24.560 --> 2:23:29.560
 with data that we're capturing that has never been observed.

2:23:29.880 --> 2:23:34.480
 And there's another aspect, which is on the personal life.

2:23:34.480 --> 2:23:37.560
 Many people say, oh, I'm not gonna have kids, why bother?

2:23:37.560 --> 2:23:39.160
 I can tell you as a father,

2:23:41.280 --> 2:23:44.560
 they're missing half the picture, if not the whole picture.

2:23:44.560 --> 2:23:49.040
 Teaching my kids about my view of the world

2:23:49.040 --> 2:23:51.200
 and watching through their eyes

2:23:51.200 --> 2:23:53.480
 the naivete with which they start

2:23:53.480 --> 2:23:55.920
 and the sophistication with which they end up,

2:23:56.920 --> 2:24:00.080
 the understanding that they have

2:24:00.080 --> 2:24:02.720
 of not just the natural world around them, but of me too.

2:24:05.120 --> 2:24:10.120
 The unfiltered criticism that you get from your own children

2:24:10.120 --> 2:24:13.800
 that knows no bounds of honesty.

2:24:15.200 --> 2:24:18.840
 And I've grown components of my heart

2:24:18.840 --> 2:24:20.800
 that I didn't know I had

2:24:20.800 --> 2:24:25.000
 until you sense that fragility,

2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:28.880
 that vulnerability of the children,

2:24:30.360 --> 2:24:33.040
 that immense love and passion,

2:24:34.040 --> 2:24:36.560
 the unfiltered egoism,

2:24:36.560 --> 2:24:40.080
 that we as adults learn how to hide so much better.

2:24:40.080 --> 2:24:43.720
 It's just this back of emotions

2:24:43.720 --> 2:24:48.720
 that tell me about the raw materials that make a human being

2:24:48.720 --> 2:24:50.880
 and how these raw materials can be arranged

2:24:50.880 --> 2:24:53.880
 with more sophistication that we learn through life

2:24:53.880 --> 2:24:56.760
 to become truly human adults.

2:24:57.760 --> 2:24:59.960
 But there's something so beautiful

2:24:59.960 --> 2:25:02.480
 about seeing that progression between them

2:25:02.480 --> 2:25:05.040
 and seeing that progress and that progress

2:25:05.040 --> 2:25:07.280
 and that progression between them,

2:25:07.280 --> 2:25:10.600
 the complexity of the language growing

2:25:10.600 --> 2:25:12.720
 as more neural connections are formed

2:25:13.720 --> 2:25:18.560
 to realize that the hardware is getting rearranged

2:25:18.560 --> 2:25:21.600
 as their software is getting implemented on that hardware,

2:25:22.640 --> 2:25:24.880
 that their frontal cortex continues to grow

2:25:24.880 --> 2:25:26.160
 for another 10 years.

2:25:27.840 --> 2:25:29.960
 There's neuronal connections that are continuing to form,

2:25:29.960 --> 2:25:33.120
 new neurons that actually get replicated and formed.

2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:38.120
 And it's just incredible that we have these,

2:25:38.120 --> 2:25:40.680
 not just you grow the hardware for 30 years

2:25:40.680 --> 2:25:42.640
 and then you feed it all of the knowledge.

2:25:42.640 --> 2:25:45.200
 No, no, the knowledge is fed throughout

2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:48.480
 and is shaping these neural connections as they're forming.

2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:52.840
 So seeing that transformation from either your own blood

2:25:52.840 --> 2:25:54.560
 or from an adopted child

2:25:54.560 --> 2:25:57.520
 is the most beautiful thing you can do as a human being.

2:25:57.520 --> 2:26:00.760
 And it completes you, it completes that path, that journey.

2:26:00.760 --> 2:26:04.880
 The create life, oh sure, that's at conception, that's easy.

2:26:04.880 --> 2:26:08.400
 But create human life to add the human part,

2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:13.160
 that takes decades of compassion, of sharing,

2:26:13.160 --> 2:26:18.160
 of love and of anger and of impatience and patience.

2:26:18.640 --> 2:26:21.880
 And as a parent,

2:26:21.880 --> 2:26:24.960
 I think I've become a very different kind of teacher

2:26:25.960 --> 2:26:27.080
 because again, I'm a professor.

2:26:27.080 --> 2:26:31.040
 My first role is to bring adult human beings

2:26:31.040 --> 2:26:34.440
 into a more mature level of adulthood

2:26:34.440 --> 2:26:37.040
 where they learn not just to do science,

2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:39.840
 but they learn the process of discovery

2:26:39.840 --> 2:26:42.280
 and the process of collaboration, the process of sharing,

2:26:42.280 --> 2:26:44.840
 the process of conveying the knowledge

2:26:44.840 --> 2:26:48.000
 of encapsulating something incredibly complex

2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:51.200
 and sort of giving it up in sort of bite sized chunks

2:26:51.200 --> 2:26:54.400
 that the rest of humanity can appreciate.

2:26:54.400 --> 2:26:57.440
 I tell my students all the time, if you, you know,

2:26:57.440 --> 2:26:58.720
 like when an apple fall,

2:26:58.720 --> 2:27:00.840
 when a tree falls in the forest

2:27:00.840 --> 2:27:03.040
 and no one's there to listen, has it really fallen?

2:27:03.040 --> 2:27:05.280
 The same way you do this awesome research,

2:27:05.280 --> 2:27:08.640
 if you write an impenetrable paper that no one will understand,

2:27:08.640 --> 2:27:11.040
 it's as if you never did the awesome research.

2:27:11.040 --> 2:27:15.200
 So conveying of knowledge, conveying this lateral transfer

2:27:15.200 --> 2:27:17.520
 that I was talking about at the very beginning

2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:22.480
 of sort of humanity and sort of the sharing of information,

2:27:22.480 --> 2:27:27.200
 all of that has gotten so much more rich

2:27:27.200 --> 2:27:30.920
 by seeing human beings grow in my own home

2:27:32.240 --> 2:27:35.080
 because that makes me a better parent

2:27:35.080 --> 2:27:38.920
 and that makes me a better teacher and a better mentor

2:27:38.920 --> 2:27:42.240
 to the nurturing of my adult children,

2:27:42.240 --> 2:27:43.960
 which are my research group.

2:27:43.960 --> 2:27:48.280
 First of all, beautifully put, connects beautifully

2:27:48.280 --> 2:27:52.240
 to the vertical and the horizontal inheritance of ideas

2:27:52.240 --> 2:27:54.440
 that we talked about at the very beginning.

2:27:54.440 --> 2:27:57.320
 I don't think there's a better way to end it

2:27:57.320 --> 2:28:01.320
 on this poetic and powerful note.

2:28:01.320 --> 2:28:02.920
 Manolis, thank you so much for talking to me.

2:28:02.920 --> 2:28:03.760
 It was a huge honor.

2:28:03.760 --> 2:28:07.240
 We'll have to talk again about the origin of life,

2:28:07.240 --> 2:28:10.520
 about epigenetics, epigenomics,

2:28:10.520 --> 2:28:13.600
 and some of the incredible research you're doing.

2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:15.320
 Truly an honor. Thanks so much for talking to me.

2:28:15.320 --> 2:28:17.240
 Thank you. Such a pleasure. It's such a pleasure.

 I've had such a blast here and I can't wait to be back.

 Awesome.

 And now let me leave you with some words

2:28:57.360 --> 2:29:00.080
 from Charles Darwin that I think Manolis

2:29:00.080 --> 2:29:01.680
 represents quite beautifully.

2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:04.840
 If I had my life to live over again,

2:29:04.840 --> 2:29:07.560
 I would have made a rule to read some poetry

2:29:07.560 --> 2:29:11.640
 and listen to some music at least once every week.

2:29:11.640 --> 2:29:23.640
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
